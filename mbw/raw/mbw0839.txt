[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.920]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly. The whole team is here, Jason Andie and Alex will answer my rhetorical question.
[00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:13.680]   What does Apple have to hide? Is Apple going to have an event this month? And if not, why not?
[00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:20.160]   We'll also talk about why you should not take your Apple watch onto a rollercoaster and a big
[00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:27.520]   day for celebration. If you're a Mac lover, just don't call it a notebook anymore. It's all coming up next.

[00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:47.840]   Joining us, the official Mac Break Weekly team, Alex Lindsey from officehowers.global and 090.media.
[00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:54.160]   Hello, Alex. Hello, hello. He has a paper millionaire thanks to his investment 20 years ago.
[00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:59.600]   A virtual paper, not even a paper millionaire. Paper millionaire actually has stock and something.
[00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:05.760]   I got nothing. The good wishes. What was it called?
[00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:08.480]   Meritocracy. Meritocracy.
[00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:12.640]   Back when you could, you could, they'd let you in, you'd give you a million dollars and you'd,
[00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:17.680]   and it turns out I found that if I invest in a bunch of stocks and then forget about it for
[00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:23.600]   18 years, but I get about 26, 26 percent a year. Should have, I wish I had real money back then.
[00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:32.400]   Andy Enoco is also here, a proud member of the middle class at Enoco.com. You see, you see,
[00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:38.000]   why people, I don't trim my fingernails. They're worn to nubs by trying to cling to the middle class.
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:43.200]   They're, I'm still there. They're raw, they're bloody, but they're still there.
[00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:50.160]   Shrinking class, but he's proud to be in it. And Jason Snell from six colors.com.
[00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:54.160]   I live in Marin County. So what does that tell you? I tell people I live in
[00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:58.240]   Mill Valley, California, they're like, ooh, and I say, oh, no, I live in the flat part by the freeway.
[00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:06.160]   As my good friend, the realtor Ray Brown always told me never buy the most valuable house in the
[00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:11.280]   block, always buy the least valuable because they're the biggest growth potential. It's all
[00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:18.000]   location, location, location. That's what I hear. Yeah. Here, here, here. We were in Tiberon
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:23.440]   over the way. Yeah, that's fancy. That's the fancy part of Marin. Holy cow.
[00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:30.160]   Oh, it's an escalator. Like Mill Valley is expensive. Tiberon is super expensive. And you're
[00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:33.840]   like, Oh, well, Tiberon's obviously the, but then there's Belvedere. It's like you keep going.
[00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:37.760]   Oh, yeah, you can go in a while. Eventually they don't allow you to enter after a while.
[00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:43.600]   Yeah. Just no, sorry. Does Mill Valley still have that sign like at the town limit saying
[00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:47.120]   proud future, proud past home of fictional BJ Honeycutt of Mass?
[00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:52.160]   You know, they're doing a, they're doing a project in a local town square. And one of the
[00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:55.840]   suggestions that they were like, make suggestions for what you want. And I said, well, obviously,
[00:03:55.840 --> 00:04:00.640]   the BJ Honeycutt statue. That's what should be there. Because you guys are such all the people
[00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:05.200]   that live in Mill Valley, you know, Jerry. Well, well, well, well, Mike Farrell is still alive to
[00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:09.440]   like be there for the dedication ceremony. You need that. You need to have. And we joke about
[00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:14.240]   these things, but it's like, imagine being like a little kid and like only knowing pretty much
[00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:18.480]   New England. So Mill Valley, I know there's this town called Mill Valley, California where
[00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:22.720]   BJ Honeycutt comes from. Oh, that's interesting. That's right. It took about it. It puts people
[00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:28.000]   on the map, but it does put places on the map. There's, you know, there's a Mary Telling Moore
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.920]   statue. There's a Captain Kirk statue. There's like, I, there's plenty of precedents. That's
[00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:35.680]   how I found out. Do you know, do you realize there's a whole state called Iowa?
[00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:43.040]   Do you know? I thought it was a Star Trek floor in Winslow. Exactly. I thought it was a
[00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:48.560]   planet until I was like 18 or 19. Oh, Leo, is somebody standing on the corner in Winslow?
[00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:55.760]   There is a park called standing on a corner. And it has a girl, my lord,
[00:04:56.640 --> 00:05:03.520]   is statue in the flatbed Ford. Yeah. Yeah. It's apparently, I'm told by people who live in
[00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:07.920]   Winslow, Arizona. Yes. Absolutely. I wonder, did you just take it easy after that? Then you just
[00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:11.920]   take it. Take it easy. Take it easy. It's very, the park, park, it's park. So you just take it easy.
[00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:16.560]   Let me see if I can find. There's a whole bunch of people. As long as you don't let the sound of your
[00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:20.880]   own wheels drive you crazy. They also do it. Apparently, it's standing on the corner festival.
[00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:25.760]   There's a whole bunch of Gen Zs like, what are they talking about? Like this is all around them.
[00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:32.880]   Yeah. There's the flatbed Ford. And here's a pickup. Look at there. I mean, the statue.
[00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:40.320]   And sees as standing on a corner, Winslow, Arizona. Boy, that's taken your moment of notoriety
[00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:44.800]   pretty darn seriously. You got to work with what you have. Go work with what you have.
[00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:50.480]   That's it. That's why they've got that Captain Kirk statue in Davenport, Iowa too. Same reason.
[00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:55.440]   All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. Have anybody received an invitation to
[00:05:55.440 --> 00:06:04.560]   a putative Apple, not put in a putative. Putative in the mind Apple event for next week, next Tuesday.
[00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:10.160]   No. So maybe maybe German's right and I was wrong and there is not going to be a real event.
[00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:17.520]   In fact, the german says that don't expect iOS 16 for your iPad or iPad,
[00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:26.880]   iOS 16 until October 24th because the Apple quarterly results call is the 27th. And so that means,
[00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:32.320]   apparently that's when they do these things historically. Yeah, right before the event.
[00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:37.040]   So we think we'll won't be there won't be an event or maybe it'll be on the 25th.
[00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:41.760]   Well, I mean, what does what do we mean by event? I think is the is the big question.
[00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:46.240]   Well, like something that the Steve Jobs either where people show up and yeah, no,
[00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:52.720]   I don't think there will be, but I think that they can still right do an event in terms of like
[00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:56.560]   doing one of their little videos, the place for an hour that everybody goes and sees rather than
[00:06:56.560 --> 00:07:00.560]   just dropping a press release. There's there's another move for them that isn't inviting a whole
[00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:05.600]   bunch of people into a theater to watch a video that is stream live on the internet.
[00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:10.080]   They can still just run a video live and you know, it'll be interesting to see if that's what they
[00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:13.760]   do or if they just drop press releases because I think the video is way more effective because
[00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:17.440]   they get to force people to watch a commercial for an hour. What could be better if you're
[00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:22.960]   out of it? Yeah, yeah. I mean, the question would be what would what would they be what would
[00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:28.560]   they be releasing in hardware that would merit? Hey, we want people to have it. We want analysts
[00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:33.440]   and pundits and video and youtubers to have a chance to actually lay hands on physical product
[00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:39.760]   and see something versus no, we've just it's a same box same shape same specs just into it.
[00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:44.000]   When you do benchmarks and you do stuff, it'll run faster and you can attach more screens to it,
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:49.040]   but pretty much that's it. So yeah, that's I'm starting to feel more and more like that's a
[00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:54.000]   that's a really good good press education. But although it's although it's really changing
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:08:00.080]   like my my schedule for the month because now it's like every every every day it's like wake up
[00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:05.120]   see if there's a press release in my inbox about a brand new Mac mini. If not, I go back to sleep.
[00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:09.920]   If there is, I quickly go to the Apple store and do my preorder. So that's that's me for the next
[00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:18.480]   three weeks. All right, I felt like there was so like the M2 pro and Max and maybe an ultra and
[00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:23.760]   well, tease of a Mac. You might get released this fall. It just may not be in October. Like,
[00:08:23.760 --> 00:08:27.200]   no, no, I know, but I feel like it was worth an event. That's all I'm saying. I mean, I know
[00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:31.440]   they'll release it, but I feel it was worth an event again. What's what's an event though, like,
[00:08:31.440 --> 00:08:36.880]   I really could make the argument that if they do a one hour video that they tell people about a
[00:08:36.880 --> 00:08:41.200]   few days in advance, that's an event, I guess. That's an event. And then they just for the press,
[00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:46.480]   they would just do briefings instead of having everybody come at once, which is because right
[00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:51.520]   because they that iPhone event. I mean, we didn't see anything other than Tim Cook showing up at
[00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:55.760]   the beginning and saying, Hi, everybody, watch my video. Everything else was literally we were
[00:08:55.760 --> 00:09:00.000]   just watching what would we could have watched at home in the live stream. The value, as we said
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:04.960]   the other week, is that the members of the media got to see the hardware and all that. Well,
[00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:10.000]   the other way you can do it is literally invite your reviewers who are going to be getting their
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:16.320]   hands on the hardware to come to Cupertino or New York or wherever else they do a briefing
[00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:22.800]   and give them the briefing and just do that and run the video anyway. There's no appreciable
[00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:29.760]   difference in that, I think. Yeah, but the difference is that there's, when you can have a
[00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:36.480]   like 500 people at least invited to this event. And so 500 people to hundreds more in the demo
[00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:42.160]   room and 500 people hundreds more writing and doing videos based on, Hey, here's my experiences
[00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:47.840]   with the blah, blah, blah, whereas you'll have maybe two dozen people who are going to be
[00:09:47.840 --> 00:09:51.440]   who are going to be in the pre briefings. And most of them are going to be locked into an NDA
[00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:56.480]   that says you can't publish anything for another week. This is why this is why these
[00:09:57.040 --> 00:10:02.080]   demo room has kind of a double value. It allows the people who are under NDA to have, guess what,
[00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:08.080]   you can get the day of announcement video in and hands on, but unbeknownst to anybody else,
[00:10:08.080 --> 00:10:11.200]   Hey, guess what's in my guess what's in my backpack right now is I'm shooting this video,
[00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:17.840]   the exact same thing. So it's it's the question is what, what does Apple, what is Apple's goal for
[00:10:17.840 --> 00:10:23.920]   PR and marketing and messaging off of such an event? And I think the question would be
[00:10:24.640 --> 00:10:30.160]   in October, if it truly is rumored that if the rumors are true, and truly the big shot is going
[00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:36.720]   to be a new Mac mini, maybe an updated iPad, and all both in both cases, pretty much just new
[00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:42.400]   silicon and not brand new silicon we haven't seen before, what would be the value in doing that?
[00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:46.880]   Oh, the value is you have the pro is out there. The fact that you pro is out there. That would
[00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:52.640]   be that would be new silicon. The value is you have the attention. Even if Apple were to announce
[00:10:52.640 --> 00:10:59.920]   iPod socks, you have the attention of the press and the and to a great degree, the public. That is,
[00:10:59.920 --> 00:11:05.280]   I mean, how much money do you spend for a Super Bowl ad? You're talking that level of attention.
[00:11:05.280 --> 00:11:09.600]   Why would you turn it down? Why would you? Why would you dismiss it? Well, it gets back into if
[00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:14.240]   you go back to the well too often without something that's worth going to then press is less likely
[00:11:14.240 --> 00:11:20.400]   to to come the next time. Don't give me a break. The press will go to anything Apple ever does for
[00:11:20.400 --> 00:11:26.720]   now. It's levels and Andy's right. There are different levels here. When Apple did the 16
[00:11:26.720 --> 00:11:33.680]   inch MacBook Pro in 2019, that was my last in person Apple briefing in the old style before COVID.
[00:11:33.680 --> 00:11:38.800]   I mean, that was a bunch of people got invited the day before the announcement under embargo. We
[00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:44.480]   were given the hardware with an embargo time and then they did a big announcement and the big
[00:11:44.480 --> 00:11:50.160]   announcement came with Apple's announcement plus a whole bunch of media writing stories about the
[00:11:50.160 --> 00:11:56.000]   12 hours that they spent with the hardware in advance. You can do that sort of scenario if you want to.
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:00.800]   But that was one device. Well, yeah, but I mean, that and a 14.
[00:12:00.800 --> 00:12:06.000]   But if it's a handful, but if there are no different hardware, right, if it's really,
[00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:10.640]   like Andy said, the Silicon difference and I'm a Mac mini bump and it's a nice collection.
[00:12:10.640 --> 00:12:15.360]   But what I'm saying is there's not much difference, like inviting people to Cupertino.
[00:12:16.640 --> 00:12:20.880]   It's just there's not that much difference between that and running a video online. I think the
[00:12:20.880 --> 00:12:25.600]   question is, are you running a video or are you just doing a press release? Because and I don't
[00:12:25.600 --> 00:12:30.720]   know why you wouldn't do a video regardless. But I don't think you necessarily need people in person
[00:12:30.720 --> 00:12:36.960]   with a date and a time and you make a big splash out of it. They've done that during COVID.
[00:12:36.960 --> 00:12:42.000]   They did that during COVID. You don't have to invite people. You don't have to know. I don't.
[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:45.920]   I really don't agree. I think it doesn't matter if you invite the press to the camera.
[00:12:45.920 --> 00:12:48.240]   Here's the link bait article. If I were right.
[00:12:48.240 --> 00:12:54.240]   Tuesday at 10 AM, we're going to do a great event and it's entirely just a video that runs online.
[00:12:54.240 --> 00:12:58.720]   I think that is all they need to do. If I were writing a link bait article for Forbes,
[00:12:58.720 --> 00:13:06.800]   the headline would be, What is Apple afraid of by Leo LaPorte? No event? Why not?
[00:13:06.800 --> 00:13:11.920]   And then the first line answers the question by simply repeating the headline and removing the
[00:13:11.920 --> 00:13:18.880]   word by Leo LaPorte. Yeah, maybe that's what they're afraid of. No, I think
[00:13:18.880 --> 00:13:28.080]   I just don't think it's a sensible marketing strategy. And if you've got, well, look, we know
[00:13:28.080 --> 00:13:32.880]   they have at least four products that are going to announce a MacBook Pro 14, a MacBook Pro 16.
[00:13:32.880 --> 00:13:36.320]   All right. Maybe it's the same old design, although remember the MacBook Air is not,
[00:13:36.320 --> 00:13:40.880]   but OK, maybe it's the same old design. And iPad, that is an important product for them.
[00:13:40.880 --> 00:13:45.440]   And iPad Pro, that's an important chance for them to position the iPad Pros.
[00:13:45.440 --> 00:13:50.800]   That's four products, not not one 16 inch laptop. That's four products.
[00:13:50.800 --> 00:13:57.760]   OK, what is gained by having the press watch the video on a screen at Apple Park while
[00:13:57.760 --> 00:14:03.520]   attention headlines? You think there are no headlines if they do it the old way that they did during
[00:14:03.520 --> 00:14:07.840]   the pandemic. Not the same kind of headlines. Not the same kind of headlines. If it's date and time,
[00:14:07.840 --> 00:14:13.680]   if it's look, obviously, I'm wrong. But I just, I think it's from a marketing point of view,
[00:14:13.680 --> 00:14:17.920]   it's a very odd thing to do. And the only thing, the reason I can think they're really
[00:14:17.920 --> 00:14:23.520]   that they would not do it is if there's something they want to hide. If there's, if it isn't as big
[00:14:23.520 --> 00:14:31.280]   an event as it ought to be, if supply chain shortages or disputes with TSMC or whatever are
[00:14:31.280 --> 00:14:35.920]   hurting them. I mean, I think bottom line, it's that the Mac and the iPad aren't as big as the
[00:14:35.920 --> 00:14:41.120]   iPhone. And I mean, they used to do iPhone events at your baboona and do Mac events in town hall
[00:14:41.120 --> 00:14:46.240]   and Cupertino, which is a much smaller venue. That was that was a similar choice, which is,
[00:14:46.240 --> 00:14:51.680]   we don't need to do 100% full effort for Mac for Mac speed bumps.
[00:14:51.680 --> 00:14:57.520]   Is your we don't? So your your guys position is a processor refresh would just result in negative
[00:14:57.520 --> 00:15:04.400]   PR people would go. No, Apple. No, no, that's that's no. But my my idea is that though, even if it's
[00:15:04.400 --> 00:15:08.880]   even if you're just running a video, getting the space together, getting Tim, putting an hour and
[00:15:08.880 --> 00:15:13.280]   a half of Tim Cook's time on his schedule, that's all there's a lot more investment behind the
[00:15:13.280 --> 00:15:18.640]   Chinese suruji do it or any queue, what's any queue do in these days, but then you then but then
[00:15:18.640 --> 00:15:24.560]   it feels like you're minimizing the thing anyway. And I don't I don't think they would be suspicious
[00:15:24.560 --> 00:15:29.680]   if they didn't decide to do like an actual event. I'm just saying that they have to I think they
[00:15:29.680 --> 00:15:35.200]   have to spend that kind of stuff wisely. It's you're obviously going to want to do that for the for
[00:15:35.200 --> 00:15:42.000]   Apple Watch iPhone, certainly for AirPods. Those are real those are apples least expensive and
[00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:46.960]   really consumerish driven items where the people who are going to be rushing out to buy this are
[00:15:46.960 --> 00:15:51.920]   the people who are probably going to find out about it first on TikTok, like on Instagram stories on
[00:15:51.920 --> 00:15:56.160]   like really, really quick hit. Maybe it is an acknowledgement as as the White House has even
[00:15:56.160 --> 00:15:59.760]   acknowledged that people get their news in a different way these days they get it from TikTok.
[00:15:59.760 --> 00:16:03.440]   TikTok is a lot more important than people think there's it's a people people are even
[00:16:03.440 --> 00:16:07.680]   a certain generation is even using it instead of instead of Google for search for I haven't
[00:16:07.680 --> 00:16:14.400]   ever debate with my daughter yesterday. She said, I said, what people aren't searching TikTok
[00:16:14.400 --> 00:16:19.040]   in the same way they would search Google. She said, dad, you're doing it wrong. I said, no, really,
[00:16:19.040 --> 00:16:24.320]   how could they be doing? She said, dad, you just don't understand. She almost said, okay, boomer.
[00:16:24.320 --> 00:16:28.800]   I said, well, what if I wanted to know how old the Golden Gate Bridge was? I would Google that.
[00:16:28.800 --> 00:16:32.480]   You would Google that, right? She said, no, you go to TikTok and then you get a
[00:16:32.480 --> 00:16:38.880]   she was right. I did it. You get all these really great historical pieces of it. See, my problem is
[00:16:38.880 --> 00:16:44.720]   and she says your your problem is you don't fight the algorithm. My problem is I go with it. She says,
[00:16:44.720 --> 00:16:52.000]   you can't go to TikTok and just be pleasured by it. You have to quickly swipe away from anything
[00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:56.960]   that isn't something you want, like information. You can't just say, oh, that's kind of funny.
[00:16:56.960 --> 00:17:01.120]   Look at he's taping her to the wall because you're going to get more of that.
[00:17:01.120 --> 00:17:06.160]   Well, or you can do that. So she says, you can make TikTok useful or have multiple accounts.
[00:17:06.160 --> 00:17:08.400]   Is that what you're saying? I have six accounts. Yeah, I have six accounts.
[00:17:08.400 --> 00:17:13.600]   One of them are really funny. Some of them are very focused on how to's and some of them are.
[00:17:13.600 --> 00:17:16.800]   And I'm very careful. Like I'll be sitting there. My kids will want to watch something again.
[00:17:16.800 --> 00:17:19.840]   And I'll be like, that's the wrong account. I can't do that again. Like I can't watch that.
[00:17:19.840 --> 00:17:25.360]   I will give you my reason for Apple. And by the way, it's not too late for me to be wrong.
[00:17:25.360 --> 00:17:32.960]   Or you guys to be right. But I think there's still a chance that 20 the 24th to 25th.
[00:17:32.960 --> 00:17:37.760]   They're not going to do this. But I hope. Yeah, I'm holding that hope. But look at this.
[00:17:37.760 --> 00:17:44.320]   Ed Hardy writing Cult of Mac Mac shipments shoot up a whopping 40%. This is in a market where PC
[00:17:44.320 --> 00:17:50.560]   shipments are down more than they have ever been in history. And look at the headline here.
[00:17:50.560 --> 00:17:56.480]   The July launch of the sleek M2 MacBook Air helped surely to push up Mac shipments last quarter.
[00:17:56.480 --> 00:18:03.360]   So make a big deal about it. You are right in the wave, baby. So if you're surfing and the wave
[00:18:03.360 --> 00:18:08.480]   is coming, you don't just go, yeah, have a nice time wave and paddle out farther.
[00:18:08.480 --> 00:18:13.120]   Well, that's what they'll definitely do with their earnings call. I will point out that there
[00:18:13.120 --> 00:18:17.280]   was another study that said that it was flat and another study that said it was down.
[00:18:17.280 --> 00:18:22.640]   Because these studies kind of make things up. Apple doesn't say. Yeah. But I want to.
[00:18:22.640 --> 00:18:27.120]   Here's a hypothetical for you about this. How important is this thing should it be in event is
[00:18:27.120 --> 00:18:31.600]   one of the great advantages of having people at Apple Park in person is to get their hands on.
[00:18:31.600 --> 00:18:36.000]   Like we said, the hands on area and you get to see it. Well, theoretically, if the Mac Mini is a
[00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:40.000]   speed bump and the Mac Mini hardware didn't change and the MacBook Pro hardware didn't change,
[00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:45.520]   it's just got the M2 chip in it. And the iPad didn't change. It's just got a new chip in it.
[00:18:45.520 --> 00:18:49.920]   The iPad Pro, let's say. Well, why are we even there? Right? Like it's like, if it's everything
[00:18:49.920 --> 00:18:55.600]   you've seen before and the chips changed, is there benefit in having people have their hands on?
[00:18:55.600 --> 00:19:00.800]   I like, I just feel like Apple's got more than one event in its playbook. It's got the kind of big
[00:19:00.800 --> 00:19:05.440]   event. It's got this kind of virtual event and then it's got the press release. And this feels like
[00:19:05.440 --> 00:19:13.600]   a middle event to me. But hold out hope they could do something. It seems like it would happen or
[00:19:13.600 --> 00:19:17.440]   have happened in the last hour probably if it was. Yeah, yeah. No, I think it's probably not going
[00:19:17.440 --> 00:19:23.520]   to happen. But it's a pretty big lift to bring people to the campus. It's not a minor thing to
[00:19:23.520 --> 00:19:28.800]   say, oh, we're going to have people come in. And they've definitely figured out the video release
[00:19:28.800 --> 00:19:34.640]   process. I definitely agree that if there's no major change to the form factor, it doesn't
[00:19:34.640 --> 00:19:38.480]   really mean that it is an enormous. I mean, I've worked on a bunch of different
[00:19:38.480 --> 00:19:45.440]   keynotes for a lot of different companies. And bringing people in is 10 times more complicated
[00:19:45.440 --> 00:19:52.480]   than just playing out the video. It's not like plenty of money. It's a limited number of people.
[00:19:52.480 --> 00:19:56.400]   You have a lot of money, but it's not just not like there's. They just hire you, Alex. Oh,
[00:19:56.400 --> 00:20:01.040]   9/0 media. Go out and get Alex Lindsey. He could do it. He'll do it for 5 million.
[00:20:01.840 --> 00:20:06.160]   Exactly. It's not sure. Absolutely. Just I just want to underline that.
[00:20:06.160 --> 00:20:12.480]   But that hardly said, Alex, something got easier. 100% in that. But it's just it's dealing with
[00:20:12.480 --> 00:20:18.560]   that it's the security is the infrastructure. It's not interested. It's food. Everything.
[00:20:18.560 --> 00:20:23.120]   So this is a task that impures people. So this is a tacit admission from Apple that
[00:20:23.120 --> 00:20:28.320]   yeah, what we got is just kind of more the same. So, you know, we're not going to watch it when
[00:20:28.320 --> 00:20:33.040]   we do the office hours thing when they say this is the best iPhone ever. We're waiting for someday
[00:20:33.040 --> 00:20:37.440]   for them to say, you know, this one wasn't as good as last year, but it was always better.
[00:20:37.440 --> 00:20:41.520]   And you know, we're doing the best we can. We realize we'd be to we take a lot of crap if we
[00:20:41.520 --> 00:20:46.160]   didn't release something and some of you are dumb enough because we do we're pretending.
[00:20:46.160 --> 00:20:51.440]   You guys are making my case. I just need to get Larry David up there and be like,
[00:20:51.440 --> 00:20:57.760]   part of the good part of the message is that the iPhone, you know, it's not the iPhone. And so,
[00:20:57.760 --> 00:21:02.000]   like, they don't invite the same people to a Mac event than they do to an iPhone event. They just
[00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:06.320]   they just don't because those people, if you invite them and it's just the Mac and the iPad,
[00:21:06.320 --> 00:21:10.640]   they're going to be like, why did I fly all this way? Like, so you got it's a smaller group of
[00:21:10.640 --> 00:21:14.560]   media who are interested and they're less interested. And that's nothing bad about the Mac and the
[00:21:14.560 --> 00:21:19.600]   iPad, but the Mac and the iPad aren't the iPhone. So a maybe a smaller event is a better. They have
[00:21:19.600 --> 00:21:24.320]   had Mac and I they have had Mac and iPad events in the past. They have they definitely have I
[00:21:24.320 --> 00:21:28.960]   think COVID has changed their strategy. So they have a new mindset. Yeah. And the old
[00:21:28.960 --> 00:21:33.760]   time they might have taken us to Brooklyn or whatever, like they did back in 2018 and said,
[00:21:33.760 --> 00:21:38.480]   Oh, here we here we are and check this out. And I think I think the and this is a question.
[00:21:38.480 --> 00:21:43.040]   This is something for us to watch over the next couple of years is did COVID teach Apple that
[00:21:43.040 --> 00:21:46.320]   there are a whole bunch of things that they used to do as events that they should just do as videos.
[00:21:46.320 --> 00:21:50.720]   I'm sure. And this might be an example of that. I feel like tech companies are becoming
[00:21:50.720 --> 00:21:55.680]   innervated in this post COVID era. You look at look at Google's event last week, which was very
[00:21:55.680 --> 00:22:04.320]   much. Well, okay. We're tired, but I don't know. I thought I thought it was I thought it was
[00:22:04.320 --> 00:22:08.000]   pretty good. And I thought it was kind of you were there with me. So we were was that Andy?
[00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:11.440]   Where was that? Where was the you were in Brooklyn? Actually, you were there. It was it was in
[00:22:11.440 --> 00:22:16.240]   Bedstuy. Yeah, it was at the they they they found it they had a venue that was just like a couple
[00:22:16.240 --> 00:22:21.760]   blocks away from the new Google store, the app that they they opened in Bedstuy. It was only like
[00:22:21.760 --> 00:22:26.400]   about 100 people. So it was like a small space, small art space. It was a cool space. I like the
[00:22:26.400 --> 00:22:30.720]   way that they present. I like the way that they presented it. Like obviously they had already taken
[00:22:30.720 --> 00:22:36.000]   the covers off of the the pixel watch like actually where right now and the new phone.
[00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:42.080]   Oh, let me see. Oh, oh, don't just throw that up in the air and then. Yeah, see, I also see Apple
[00:22:42.080 --> 00:22:46.960]   event. But yeah, so it doesn't have it always on display. Well, you can you can you can have it.
[00:22:46.960 --> 00:22:52.960]   You can turn it always on if you want. Oh, okay. Yeah, see. But yeah, very I can talk about if
[00:22:52.960 --> 00:22:58.720]   you want if we want. No, no, I like it. But they pussy they they even they're they even do NDA's
[00:22:58.720 --> 00:23:04.320]   differently. So this is I'm under NDA. But the NDA basically says you can show it. You can have
[00:23:04.320 --> 00:23:09.440]   it. You can you can't review of it. You can you can give it you can up until tomorrow you can do
[00:23:09.440 --> 00:23:14.640]   like quick takes on it. I was like the very next morning I was on NPR, like giving it showing it
[00:23:14.640 --> 00:23:18.960]   off and giving a quick take on it. You just can't do anything in depth about it. But the way I
[00:23:18.960 --> 00:23:22.800]   didn't I thought that the presentation was it was just different from the way that Apple does
[00:23:22.800 --> 00:23:27.280]   a present day. It was low energy though. But you know, but but but but but here's the point.
[00:23:27.280 --> 00:23:32.800]   Well, no, no, see, no, here's the point they what I liked about it is that they spent the first 15
[00:23:32.800 --> 00:23:38.560]   minutes not showing off like here is a dramatic like, you know, 3d like reveal. It was here's why
[00:23:38.560 --> 00:23:44.480]   here's our approach to this whole line. Here's here's what here's why we call something a pixel.
[00:23:44.480 --> 00:23:50.640]   Here's what we want to do with the entire line. It was an engineer. It was it was it was it was
[00:23:50.640 --> 00:23:54.880]   actually it was aimed at the people I think in the room who were about to write about this as
[00:23:54.880 --> 00:24:00.240]   opposed to sparkle sparkle sparkle. Ooh applause break applause break applause break. So and so I
[00:24:00.240 --> 00:24:05.520]   don't think it was low energy. It was all like there was one recorded piece. But is so for the
[00:24:05.520 --> 00:24:10.960]   most part was live. You and I wanted to who who skyped in or whatever or argue that
[00:24:10.960 --> 00:24:16.400]   Apple can't go back to all live because the energy that you're talking about, I don't think
[00:24:16.400 --> 00:24:19.840]   they were tired. I just don't think you can keep up the pace that you start with the video. Yeah,
[00:24:19.840 --> 00:24:22.800]   yeah, you can't do it. And so the thing is that once you tighten that video up and once you have
[00:24:22.800 --> 00:24:30.160]   it all there, you and I think that, you know, it does stage presentations feel about one 10th
[00:24:30.160 --> 00:24:34.240]   the energy as something that you just tighten all up. It's the same it's a someone presenting,
[00:24:34.240 --> 00:24:38.640]   but now we're cutting quickly. They have a perfect take every time. They're able to move through
[00:24:38.640 --> 00:24:42.400]   things. We can add effects. We can do all the other things. And even though Apple's feels like
[00:24:42.400 --> 00:24:48.640]   it's a stage experience, it was that slow before we just now are used to the new pace because it's
[00:24:48.640 --> 00:24:53.520]   all video. And I think that a lot of other companies are going to keep learning that because the stage
[00:24:53.520 --> 00:24:57.680]   thing is, as someone who sat through hundreds and hundreds of them streaming them, it's real.
[00:24:58.880 --> 00:25:03.920]   And can I say it was it was kind of embarrassing that element of Apple's live presentations.
[00:25:03.920 --> 00:25:12.080]   Okay, this is this is not the Ellen show. You're not getting everyone's not getting
[00:25:12.080 --> 00:25:19.200]   free like 48 inch like HDTV. Just take your notes, observe the skeptical ready for the break.
[00:25:19.200 --> 00:25:25.040]   Yeah, the people applauding were not those people. The people applauding were the Apple VIPs and
[00:25:25.040 --> 00:25:29.360]   Apple employees seated at the front of this theater with the best seats so that they and they would
[00:25:29.360 --> 00:25:33.600]   be essentially instructed when to applaud because it was showbiz right they just wanted applause
[00:25:33.600 --> 00:25:38.640]   sounds. So they got them. That's why I said it's embarrassing like to want to basically create
[00:25:38.640 --> 00:25:43.120]   this high energy. Oh my God, everybody's so excited about this. Are we looking to be here?
[00:25:43.120 --> 00:25:47.440]   It's like, dude, you're again, you're $2 trillion copy that's trying to sell a $1,200 phone
[00:25:47.440 --> 00:25:52.320]   perspective. Let's just have perspective. But I think that I think that a lot of that again is
[00:25:52.320 --> 00:25:56.240]   going away. I mean, I think that we're just it's going to slowly wind itself out. It was it was
[00:25:56.240 --> 00:26:01.840]   something that Steve Jobs was really good at and almost nobody else is. And so the thing is is that
[00:26:01.840 --> 00:26:06.400]   everyone else tries to do what Steve Jobs was doing. I think that the keynote became what it is
[00:26:06.400 --> 00:26:13.680]   because of Steve Jobs. It became this giant thing. And I think other people have tried to reproduce
[00:26:13.680 --> 00:26:17.520]   it. I think we're especially now after COVID when we realize our videos are a lot easier than this,
[00:26:17.520 --> 00:26:22.000]   that the chances of us going back, I think we'll just keep on finding more and more people going
[00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:24.960]   to video because it just makes a lot more sense. It's better for the... I don't know if they're
[00:26:24.960 --> 00:26:28.560]   easier, right? I mean, it's not that they're easier. It's that they're way more effective,
[00:26:28.560 --> 00:26:33.680]   especially if you're not Steve Jobs. And I think you're right. I wonder, I really wonder of Apple.
[00:26:33.680 --> 00:26:38.560]   I used to theorize that Apple might do like a little like a little wrapper that was live. So like
[00:26:38.560 --> 00:26:42.800]   an event like the iPhone and the other WWDC, they'd come out on stage live and then they play a lot
[00:26:42.800 --> 00:26:47.360]   of videos, but there'd be little interstitials and they'd let the crowd noise through and stuff like
[00:26:47.360 --> 00:26:51.520]   that. I'm not sure that's ever going to happen. I feel like maybe the model is now set, which is
[00:26:51.520 --> 00:26:56.240]   they're just going to do videos and Tim Cook called it a film, right? It's like, so we make a film
[00:26:56.240 --> 00:27:01.760]   without our products. Yes, it's our film. It's a film. Yes, it's the Apple film festival in joy.
[00:27:01.760 --> 00:27:09.120]   But it's more effective, it's faster paced. It's way more fun to watch. Yeah, it's a better product.
[00:27:09.120 --> 00:27:13.520]   And it is marketing. That's what it's for. Well, thanks to AI Steve Jobs,
[00:27:13.520 --> 00:27:19.920]   they could bring him back. I listened to this this morning. It was very strange. It was a new
[00:27:19.920 --> 00:27:30.560]   podcast called podcast.ai. And the first episode is a virtual Steve Jobs and a virtual Joe Rogan
[00:27:30.560 --> 00:27:39.040]   interviewing or as they call him, Bro Jogan or something. And let me let me cut to where they're
[00:27:39.040 --> 00:27:46.160]   actually starting to talk because it's kind of interesting. Do you have my do you have my audio?
[00:27:46.160 --> 00:27:51.440]   Without further ado, my friend who's difficult to describe and wonderful. And I'm so grateful he
[00:27:51.440 --> 00:27:56.000]   came on the show. How's it going? Good to see you, buddy. It's been a long time since I've been on
[00:27:56.000 --> 00:28:01.440]   the show. I missed this. Yeah, it's always fun. How's it going? Come on, tell me about Jobs.
[00:28:01.440 --> 00:28:11.760]   It's always good to see you, buddy. I'm so happy you came on, man. Yeah, it's great to be on the show.
[00:28:11.760 --> 00:28:17.280]   Your audience is just so different from your normal Apple users. And that's a good thing. It's cool.
[00:28:17.280 --> 00:28:22.320]   Well, you know, I was an Apple user way before I did the show. I've been a fan of yours in
[00:28:22.320 --> 00:28:29.280]   Macintosh since the 1980s. So there that was, believe it or not, that was synthesized. They say
[00:28:29.280 --> 00:28:35.440]   AI, although if you listen to it, there's bits and pieces from actual Steve, things Steve said.
[00:28:35.440 --> 00:28:40.320]   But so they, they, I don't know if the AI went through and got like everything Steve ever said,
[00:28:40.320 --> 00:28:45.280]   and then kind of like stable diffusion incorporated. Well, the part where he does the ad read for
[00:28:45.280 --> 00:28:53.760]   Ridgeball, and that was definitely synthesized GC jobs, I think. That is weird as hell. Isn't it
[00:28:53.760 --> 00:28:59.680]   weird? I mean, it sounds like them, doesn't it? Both of them. It's weird. It's maybe actionable.
[00:28:59.680 --> 00:29:03.280]   We'll find that out. That's part of the excitement of this podcast, I think, to find out who gets
[00:29:03.280 --> 00:29:09.200]   sued. Yeah, who gets sued by whom. In the actual audio, he never says, I'm talking to Steve Jobs.
[00:29:09.200 --> 00:29:14.960]   They can't do half the things we said. But these titles show is Joe Rogan, a few steep jobs.
[00:29:14.960 --> 00:29:19.040]   It'll help us to change our story. We went from being a failed company, just trying to get
[00:29:19.040 --> 00:29:23.760]   something out to being the younger, cooler alternative to IBM. That was a great blessing.
[00:29:23.760 --> 00:29:29.280]   But if windows had come out a year before, we would have been toast. IBM would have eaten our
[00:29:29.280 --> 00:29:34.480]   lunch. Do you think you'd have done a better version of Windows or work with it? No, that's
[00:29:34.480 --> 00:29:39.040]   the problem I've always had with Microsoft. In many ways, they're smart people and they've done
[00:29:39.040 --> 00:29:42.800]   good work. But they've never had any taste. That's an actual quote, right?
[00:29:42.800 --> 00:29:48.800]   So I guess the AI found it and did it in the training or maybe. But I don't know, and it's not
[00:29:48.800 --> 00:29:53.840]   clear from the podcast AI folks, is did they type in the dialogue and then have the voices?
[00:29:53.840 --> 00:29:59.840]   I think they had an AI generated a script that they then used their AI voices for. Yeah.
[00:29:59.840 --> 00:30:03.760]   Right. That's what it is. And just a hint for you guys podcast AI,
[00:30:03.760 --> 00:30:09.840]   Room Tone. Just add some room tone. Exactly. It wouldn't sound so choppy. You could certainly
[00:30:09.840 --> 00:30:15.600]   tell that the AI was trained on Joe Rogan on the studio, Mike versus it was trained on Steve
[00:30:15.600 --> 00:30:20.640]   Jobs in a theater. Yep. Yep. It's still amazing, right? Still in the audience.
[00:30:20.640 --> 00:30:24.640]   It's a candid audio. Like Leo, you have left thousands of hours of your voice.
[00:30:24.640 --> 00:30:29.520]   Tens of hours. All around the internet. So retirement plan, retirement plan,
[00:30:29.520 --> 00:30:34.080]   just to get that stuff trained. And then you can go on a vacation and we won't even know.
[00:30:34.080 --> 00:30:37.920]   There's some incentive for people to do it with Joe Rogan and Steve Jobs is zero.
[00:30:37.920 --> 00:30:44.960]   Yeah. If nobody wants, nobody wants an autonomous Leo roaming the internet. So, you know, I always
[00:30:44.960 --> 00:30:48.160]   saw it would be a good idea. I could retire early, but this is.
[00:30:48.160 --> 00:30:53.520]   Any aesthetic sense. And I think that's because the people who founded the company,
[00:30:53.520 --> 00:30:58.720]   in most cases, were fundamentally mathematicians and scientists, and they don't understand how.
[00:30:58.720 --> 00:31:02.720]   That's so the where it's showed though is how close now we can get voices.
[00:31:02.720 --> 00:31:07.680]   If you, you know, there's an uncanny valley here, you can hear it and kind of know,
[00:31:07.680 --> 00:31:11.120]   oh yeah, that's fake, but that's, you know, that could be fixed.
[00:31:11.120 --> 00:31:16.640]   And it is the AI doing, I mean, this technology is actually primitive compared to what they're
[00:31:16.640 --> 00:31:22.240]   using for like Darth Vader's voice in the Obi-Wan show on Disney Plus where they use that
[00:31:22.240 --> 00:31:27.440]   re-speacher and they took all of the James Earl Jones dialogue and they did an AI model,
[00:31:27.440 --> 00:31:33.520]   but they also modeled, I believe, an actor doing the intonation and then they matched it.
[00:31:33.520 --> 00:31:37.520]   And so you have the idea where you're trying to get it exactly right. And this doesn't sound as
[00:31:37.520 --> 00:31:42.560]   good as that because it seems like it's much more like a text to speech synthesis where it's just
[00:31:42.560 --> 00:31:49.200]   like, it is good to be here with you. And like anything else, I mean, when we started having
[00:31:49.200 --> 00:31:53.600]   synthesizers do instruments, we were like, wow, that sounds really weird. And then we got used to
[00:31:53.600 --> 00:31:56.640]   those as that's what we heard. And then they sounded exact.
[00:31:56.640 --> 00:31:59.520]   Now good luck knowing is that a real plan? Is that a fake?
[00:31:59.520 --> 00:32:01.680]   So this is just takes time.
[00:32:01.680 --> 00:32:09.840]   A podcast, I'll give them a plug podcast.ai, a podcast entirely generated by artificial intelligence.
[00:32:09.840 --> 00:32:15.600]   And this is their first episode, a good choice, Rogan and Jobs, but I presume they'll do others
[00:32:15.600 --> 00:32:22.800]   down the road. And they say the voices are powered by play.ht play.ht, I guess.
[00:32:23.520 --> 00:32:26.160]   Yeah, AI powered text to voice generation.
[00:32:26.160 --> 00:32:29.600]   And some of the stuff that I think we've talked about a little bit in the past,
[00:32:29.600 --> 00:32:35.440]   but I know we're talking about it in office hours, is where we're going to see it probably
[00:32:35.440 --> 00:32:40.080]   first is in the dubbing for movies. So a lot of people are working on this right now,
[00:32:40.080 --> 00:32:46.160]   where you have a model of Tom Cruise's voice, which we've already shown that we can reproduce.
[00:32:46.160 --> 00:32:52.720]   But you take all the intonations and his voice and give it, just type in the translators
[00:32:52.720 --> 00:32:58.240]   translation, and it gets all of the intonations correct for French or German or Chinese or whatever.
[00:32:58.240 --> 00:33:04.080]   And then it also can change his lip, his lip shapes. So, so it can put the dub in,
[00:33:04.080 --> 00:33:09.120]   it can not sound like someone who sounds like Tom Cruise, just is a Tom Cruise generation.
[00:33:09.120 --> 00:33:14.160]   And then it also fixes his mouth so that it looks like it's saying that as well.
[00:33:14.160 --> 00:33:17.360]   And that's probably one of the first places we're going to see it at a production level.
[00:33:17.360 --> 00:33:21.680]   You know where it's, you know, a lot of people, there's a lot of money going into that right now.
[00:33:22.320 --> 00:33:24.480]   Because it saves a lot of money, you know, down the road to.
[00:33:24.480 --> 00:33:30.160]   I just spent $1,700 on something that's not from Apple, but I'll talk about that when we come back.
[00:33:30.160 --> 00:33:37.040]   Weird. What could it be? You know, now that they're not having an event, well, screw it.
[00:33:37.040 --> 00:33:44.240]   I was, I was holding that money for a M.2 16 inch MacBook Pro, maybe an N.2 Ultra,
[00:33:44.240 --> 00:33:48.480]   but I guess they're not releasing one. So I have something else to spend that money on now.
[00:33:51.360 --> 00:33:55.120]   Now it's time to talk about our fine sponsor. We'll have more with Mac break weekly. Yes,
[00:33:55.120 --> 00:34:01.680]   we'll have more Apple stuff. Promise you Steve Jobs kind of Apple, right? That counts.
[00:34:01.680 --> 00:34:08.400]   Our show today brought to you by Express VPN. Oh, what a world we live in these days.
[00:34:08.400 --> 00:34:18.160]   Profiling surveillance data harvesting. Did you see our interview with a Corey Dr. Rowe and Rebecca
[00:34:18.160 --> 00:34:23.840]   Gibblin about their book, Checkpoint Capitalism? It's depressing. It's depressing or surveillance
[00:34:23.840 --> 00:34:30.160]   capitalism with Shoshana, Zuboff, another triangulation. There are a lot of things, you know, to kind of
[00:34:30.160 --> 00:34:35.680]   go, wow, I'm these tech giants. They really are invading our privacy. But you know, there is
[00:34:35.680 --> 00:34:44.480]   something you can do about it. Not give up Google. No, not spend $44 billion to buy Twitter. No,
[00:34:44.480 --> 00:34:49.920]   but the good news is you don't have to be a billionaire. You can use Express VPN for as little as $7
[00:34:49.920 --> 00:34:55.360]   a month. If you don't like big tech tracking you and selling your personal data for profit,
[00:34:55.360 --> 00:35:01.280]   it's time to fight back. That's what I use and recommend to everybody Express VPN is a VPN you
[00:35:01.280 --> 00:35:07.360]   can trust. And that's important, by the way, because if you're using a free VPN or you a VPN,
[00:35:07.360 --> 00:35:13.680]   you don't know where it came from, they could be just as invasive as big tech. Worse, frankly,
[00:35:13.680 --> 00:35:20.160]   they could be selling their stuff to data brokers, not Express VPN. They go the extra mile to make
[00:35:20.160 --> 00:35:26.080]   sure that your traffic is not logged. They cannot log it. There was a great article on
[00:35:26.080 --> 00:35:31.680]   Bleeping Computer about Express VPN and the custom Debian distro they wrote. And the custom
[00:35:31.680 --> 00:35:37.440]   server software they wrote called trusted server that runs in RAM. When you press the big button
[00:35:37.440 --> 00:35:44.960]   on your Express VPN app and they've apps for every platform, you spin up a server in RAM just for
[00:35:44.960 --> 00:35:49.520]   you. And it's sandboxed. It can't write to the disk. It can't log your presence. And when you
[00:35:49.520 --> 00:35:57.520]   close the VPN, it goes away poof. And there's no trace. And that Debian distro reboots every morning
[00:35:57.520 --> 00:36:04.880]   to a brand new fresh installation with a fresh and erased hard drive. That's why in years past,
[00:36:04.880 --> 00:36:11.360]   when authoritarian regimes have seized Express VPN hard drives, they found nothing on them.
[00:36:11.360 --> 00:36:16.560]   No information about their customers. That's why I like Express VPN.
[00:36:16.560 --> 00:36:24.480]   Don't try, you know, avoid being tracked, use Express VPN to eliminate geographic restrictions,
[00:36:25.040 --> 00:36:31.280]   that kind of thing. And of course, use Express VPN for your security when you're at an open Wi-Fi
[00:36:31.280 --> 00:36:37.280]   access point. And it's so easy. You put Express VPN on your iPhone or your Android phone, your Mac,
[00:36:37.280 --> 00:36:42.800]   your PC, your Linux box, you can even put it on many routers. Push a button or turn it on. And
[00:36:42.800 --> 00:36:48.480]   then all of a sudden your traffic is encrypted from your computer to the Express VPN servers
[00:36:48.480 --> 00:36:53.280]   anywhere in the world. You get to choose, although they will, if you don't expressly say, they'll
[00:36:53.280 --> 00:36:58.560]   choose the nearest server, the fastest server close to you. If you don't like big tech tracking you
[00:36:58.560 --> 00:37:04.960]   and selling your personal data for profit, here's a way to fight back Express VPN.com/Macbreak.
[00:37:04.960 --> 00:37:11.520]   Three months of Express VPN free when you buy a one year package brings it down below seven
[00:37:11.520 --> 00:37:16.000]   bucks a month. I'm telling you, that's a very fair price because they invest that right back
[00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:21.360]   into the servers. So they have lots of speed for you. They refresh their IP addresses. So it's,
[00:37:21.360 --> 00:37:24.560]   you know, it's a fresh IP address, which is great. Because then you can't get,
[00:37:24.560 --> 00:37:30.720]   you know, finger mark, fingerprinted as a VPN user. It's really important that you use a VPN
[00:37:30.720 --> 00:37:36.320]   provider that invests in their infrastructure. Express VPN does express VPN.com/Macbreak,
[00:37:36.320 --> 00:37:44.400]   e X P R E S S V P N dot com/Macbreak. We thank them so much for their support of Mac break weekly
[00:37:44.400 --> 00:37:52.400]   and invite you to try it out. I like it. I like it. All right, I'll tell you what I spent my money
[00:37:52.400 --> 00:38:01.280]   on today. Meta had a big event. I bet you Alex Lindsey, you kind of watch this, paid attention.
[00:38:01.280 --> 00:38:06.960]   Look, this, you know, it's, it's germane to the Apple discussion because Apple keeps saying a
[00:38:06.960 --> 00:38:14.080]   r a r a r. I guess they're not going to announce anything this year, maybe next year. Meanwhile,
[00:38:14.080 --> 00:38:19.760]   meta saying as quickly as we can, let's, let's, you know, this is, look, Facebook's failing. I mean,
[00:38:19.760 --> 00:38:23.840]   I think that that's pretty clear. Their stock prices tumbling. People are leaving them in droves.
[00:38:23.840 --> 00:38:27.840]   Right. They need a next act. And Marcus said $10 billion a year,
[00:38:27.840 --> 00:38:33.200]   thousands of engineers were going into the metaverse. Alex,
[00:38:33.200 --> 00:38:37.520]   and it's going to take that kind of work to figure it out. You know, like it's, it's, there's a lot
[00:38:37.520 --> 00:38:42.560]   to be figured out. You know, in that area. And we see them making progress, you know, along that
[00:38:42.560 --> 00:38:46.080]   path. And I think that they, they also have to make progress and trust because people are going
[00:38:46.080 --> 00:38:50.880]   to spend a lot of time in there. But, but I think that the one of the interesting things about
[00:38:50.880 --> 00:38:55.120]   what we saw with the new headset is that I think that they found that they didn't sell that many
[00:38:55.120 --> 00:39:00.400]   more by making it less expensive. Like, you know, they, yeah, this one's a 1500 dollars.
[00:39:00.400 --> 00:39:05.040]   Going down in price did not really help them. I think, I think it didn't really,
[00:39:05.040 --> 00:39:09.040]   they just found the same number of people would buy it at $1500. It would buy it at $300.
[00:39:09.040 --> 00:39:13.200]   Well, and then maybe you need to spend that kind of money to really have a headset that's,
[00:39:13.200 --> 00:39:16.880]   that's worthy. Yeah. I mean, I think that Microsoft has done a really good job, you know, with,
[00:39:16.880 --> 00:39:21.760]   with their, with their goggles, you know, so that's what's interesting. Aren't they pairing
[00:39:21.760 --> 00:39:25.280]   teaming with Microsoft for this? I think they're doing some stuff with them. Yeah,
[00:39:25.280 --> 00:39:29.280]   Microsoft has done a much better job of going top down. Let's figure out what the technology
[00:39:29.280 --> 00:39:32.320]   needs to do. And then eventually we'll figure out how to do it affordably.
[00:39:32.320 --> 00:39:36.080]   And I think that a lot of folks were trying to figure out, well, we, if we just get to the
[00:39:36.080 --> 00:39:40.720]   mass market, we can get, we can get this off the ground. But the problem is, is that the,
[00:39:40.720 --> 00:39:45.440]   a lot of the tools, and it's, it's a really hard thing to develop for still. And, and so there's a
[00:39:45.440 --> 00:39:48.560]   lot of bits and pieces that still have to put together. So I think that that's the real challenge
[00:39:48.560 --> 00:39:54.000]   for them. And so I, I do like the fact that they're making a higher performance version
[00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:58.240]   that people can use. I don't think it's going to affect the number of sales. It'll just affect
[00:39:58.240 --> 00:40:06.080]   revenue. Well, and also notice, if you go to the page, meta.com/quest/quest-pro, this is the new one.
[00:40:06.080 --> 00:40:11.200]   There's a lot of gaming going on here. This is, they're pushing this as a,
[00:40:11.200 --> 00:40:17.120]   something to design cars with, to teach school remotely with, to meet with clients.
[00:40:17.120 --> 00:40:23.680]   There's no gaming here. Yeah. Alex, Alex has a wonderful, wonderful on point there,
[00:40:24.240 --> 00:40:29.520]   because HoloLens is a success, because there are people who, there, the people who are willing to
[00:40:29.520 --> 00:40:35.200]   spend, willing to buy virtual reality, augmented reality headsets are the people that aren't
[00:40:35.200 --> 00:40:41.280]   going to blink at $1,500, $2,000, $3,000 for HoloLens, because they're in the, they're military,
[00:40:41.280 --> 00:40:47.280]   they're industrial, they're doing, they're, they're engineering. They have specific uses that have to
[00:40:47.280 --> 00:40:53.040]   have demanding, demanding technology that this has to do. They can't really do anything with a
[00:40:53.040 --> 00:41:00.080]   $350, $450 headset. But if you give them something that can actually be used to take the, to, to
[00:41:00.080 --> 00:41:04.400]   handle most a lot of the paperwork they have to do, handle a lot of the training that they have to
[00:41:04.400 --> 00:41:08.160]   do, handle a lot of the exercise they have to do, that's worth four times what they're going to pay
[00:41:08.160 --> 00:41:15.040]   for it. And it's these, it's, it is the development of the higher end headsets that are going to
[00:41:15.040 --> 00:41:22.720]   create a future five years from then, from then that can create the $500 headset with
[00:41:22.720 --> 00:41:27.680]   apps and utility that are actually going to be relatable to normal humans. That's, that's still
[00:41:27.680 --> 00:41:32.640]   like a big puzzle that, that Apple has to solve. They can create the technology, they can create a
[00:41:32.640 --> 00:41:37.440]   dazzling demo, they can create something that is really, really cool looking to put on your face.
[00:41:37.440 --> 00:41:43.760]   But at the, at the end of the game, are they going to create a reason for people,
[00:41:43.760 --> 00:41:49.120]   ordinary people who aren't necessarily, or aren't buying these, these $2,000 headsets on impulse.
[00:41:49.120 --> 00:41:52.720]   They're buying it because I want this thing. I see a role for this in my life.
[00:41:52.720 --> 00:41:57.840]   Are they going to find that role for this in people's lives beyond playing, playing the lightsaber,
[00:41:57.840 --> 00:41:59.280]   whatever game?
[00:41:59.280 --> 00:42:00.560]   Beet Saber, sure. Yeah.
[00:42:00.560 --> 00:42:04.800]   I should, by the way, be clear that you could still play Beat Saber with this.
[00:42:04.800 --> 00:42:05.360]   Exactly.
[00:42:05.360 --> 00:42:08.880]   Yeah. It's even though they don't mention it until the very bottom, they show some of the
[00:42:08.880 --> 00:42:13.680]   things you can do. It works in all your own previous stuff, but they're really pushing this
[00:42:13.680 --> 00:42:14.240]   as a pro pro.
[00:42:14.240 --> 00:42:19.760]   I don't think I entirely agree with Alex that everybody who bought it would have bought it at
[00:42:19.760 --> 00:42:23.600]   1,500 because I can tell you I bought a Quest 2 and there's no way in hell I would have bought
[00:42:23.600 --> 00:42:26.160]   a 1,500. And they're still selling the Quest 2.
[00:42:26.160 --> 00:42:31.600]   No way. But how about I do think it is wise, I do think I use it all the time and it's fun.
[00:42:31.600 --> 00:42:36.480]   I really, I really, yeah, yeah. And it's a lot of fun.
[00:42:36.480 --> 00:42:41.360]   I, so I don't really agree on that point, but I think strategically what they're doing is part
[00:42:41.360 --> 00:42:47.040]   of this is fear of what Apple's going to do. But also, I do agree. I think the idea is
[00:42:47.040 --> 00:42:53.440]   it's probably better to build an aspirational product that's overpriced, that does what,
[00:42:53.440 --> 00:42:57.920]   that cracks the case to make it more appealing for people, like the full color pass through,
[00:42:57.920 --> 00:43:04.560]   so you can do essentially augmented reality inside a VR headset, not as an overlay, but as like,
[00:43:04.560 --> 00:43:08.320]   you're seeing the real world through a camera, but then they can also draw things on top of it.
[00:43:08.320 --> 00:43:13.680]   That's what they say in the specs, full colored mixed reality with a resolution 4X higher than
[00:43:13.680 --> 00:43:19.280]   the Quest 2. So you're still in the world, you're seeing it through cameras, not, there's not an
[00:43:19.280 --> 00:43:23.040]   op, it's not optical. How does it work on the Quest 2? Is it work pretty well?
[00:43:23.040 --> 00:43:26.000]   It feels like you put the ring on like your hobbit with the ring on.
[00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:29.920]   Yeah, it's black, it's grainy black and white. It's amazing. It works at all, but it is super
[00:43:29.920 --> 00:43:33.920]   grainy black and white. It's not great. It means basically it's, so you can walk around without
[00:43:33.920 --> 00:43:39.280]   dying without taking off your headset, but that's about all it's for. But this is, so I think
[00:43:39.280 --> 00:43:44.400]   meta is smart in doing this because this is obviously Apple strategy, and I think that it's
[00:43:44.400 --> 00:43:50.720]   probably a smarter strategy, even if 1400 is a lot for a headset and 2000 maybe for Apple's headset
[00:43:50.720 --> 00:43:57.920]   is way too much for a headset. If you can make something that cracks it in terms of, oh, I see why
[00:43:57.920 --> 00:44:02.960]   you might want to use this, and then you can figure out ways to scale it down and increase how many
[00:44:02.960 --> 00:44:07.680]   you're selling so you can reduce the cost to make them and then you can lower the price.
[00:44:07.680 --> 00:44:14.080]   Like that's probably a more effective strategy than what meta was doing with the Quest, which was
[00:44:14.080 --> 00:44:19.200]   starting it low and hoping to get it better over time because yeah, mediocre VR experience and a
[00:44:19.200 --> 00:44:22.160]   bad mixed reality experience isn't going to sell anybody else.
[00:44:22.160 --> 00:44:27.600]   That's why I ordered this because I know this isn't going to be the end game for Apple or for
[00:44:27.600 --> 00:44:33.520]   meta. But in fact, probably they could charge whatever they want because the whole idea is,
[00:44:33.520 --> 00:44:39.120]   let's show you what's possible. And then you get a few people saying, hey, this is really great,
[00:44:39.120 --> 00:44:44.000]   this works. And that's the goal, right? And that's what Microsoft's done with the HoloLens. And it's
[00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:49.600]   just, they've done some stunningly good work in that area where some of the architectural stuff,
[00:44:49.600 --> 00:44:56.800]   the AEC solutions where you can put it on and you can see where the building is from the scans and
[00:44:56.800 --> 00:45:00.720]   see a lot of those things integrated. I think they've done some of the best work as far as
[00:45:00.720 --> 00:45:06.000]   not being constrained by cost. And just saying, this is what this thing needs to do right now.
[00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:09.600]   And eventually we'll figure out how to make it less expensive, but right now,
[00:45:09.600 --> 00:45:14.720]   how to make it work. Yeah. Yeah. And I think the HoloLens was even more than that.
[00:45:14.720 --> 00:45:19.760]   They went, it's a, because I think I don't remember when I think it's like a six, it was, I think at
[00:45:19.760 --> 00:45:24.560]   some point, $6,000. No, it's cheap. Isn't that now, I think. Now, but it was, you know, they started
[00:45:24.560 --> 00:45:27.920]   off pretty high and just saying, well, this is what it cost to get it done and figure it out. And again,
[00:45:27.920 --> 00:45:32.000]   for military projects, for AEC, for a lot of the other things that they were using it for,
[00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:37.120]   they, it was fine. You know, whatever that cost was worth it. But I, but I think that they've,
[00:45:37.120 --> 00:45:40.240]   they've, and I think Apple will probably come in from the top, not from the, not,
[00:45:40.240 --> 00:45:44.080]   not trying to grasp it at how to make this in effect, because we don't even know how to make it
[00:45:44.080 --> 00:45:48.960]   work yet. Like that's the big problem is that we don't even know what it takes. And so you're
[00:45:48.960 --> 00:45:52.400]   trying to solve too many variables at one time when you're trying to make it 300 bucks.
[00:45:52.400 --> 00:45:58.400]   Currently, HoloLens 2 is $3,500 unless you want to wear a fancy helmet with it. The Trimble
[00:45:58.400 --> 00:46:01.920]   version is with a hard hat integrated HoloLens is 5,100.
[00:46:01.920 --> 00:46:05.200]   I think that might be what I was thinking because the ones that I've been looking at are
[00:46:05.200 --> 00:46:11.280]   connected to Trimble because Trimble does a lot of the architectural engineering construction
[00:46:11.280 --> 00:46:16.000]   type stuff. And so then the Trimble one is the, the one that I've seen in the past. And it's,
[00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:19.200]   it's a pretty impressive solution. A hard hat integrated HoloLens 2,
[00:46:19.200 --> 00:46:24.480]   that's purpose built for personnel in dirty, loud and safety controlled worksite environments.
[00:46:24.480 --> 00:46:32.160]   And of course, they've sold more than a billion dollars worth to the US Army soldiers.
[00:46:32.160 --> 00:46:37.280]   Well, apparently we weren't too happy about this, but, but they're still going ahead with it.
[00:46:37.280 --> 00:46:41.200]   Beyond just, beyond just the safety issues, I think we might have talked about this before,
[00:46:41.200 --> 00:46:46.000]   but training people, being able to train people without having to spend, you know,
[00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:51.520]   $30,000 an hour or $40,000 an hour on an aircraft, you know, it is, you know, that,
[00:46:51.520 --> 00:46:56.160]   that really knocking down those hours by giving people something that really feels like they're
[00:46:56.160 --> 00:47:00.320]   almost there. It's not going to be the replacement for doing, doing the real world, but it is a place
[00:47:00.320 --> 00:47:06.400]   where you can get people to get a sense of where things are in space and figure those things out
[00:47:06.400 --> 00:47:11.200]   before they put themselves in harm's way or they spend a lot of money per minute to, to figure it out.
[00:47:11.200 --> 00:47:15.680]   Yeah. When they launched the Dragon Crew last week, they mentioned that these guys had
[00:47:15.680 --> 00:47:21.200]   trained with, for this, including all the sounds they recorded previous launch sounds
[00:47:21.200 --> 00:47:24.800]   and pumped them in so that they wouldn't be surprised by that sudden bang, bang, bang.
[00:47:24.800 --> 00:47:30.240]   And they said, of course, there's nothing like the real thing, but I think that does go a long
[00:47:30.240 --> 00:47:37.120]   way towards training. As, as the saying goes, NASA spent more money on the fake Apollo missions
[00:47:37.120 --> 00:47:42.000]   in simulation than the Soviets did on the actual lunar train to space programs.
[00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:46.400]   Right. Training is very important. Yeah. Baseball is a place where they're doing this too, believe
[00:47:46.400 --> 00:47:50.480]   it or not, because you can't get, yeah. So they can model pitches and, you know, it's all repetition,
[00:47:50.480 --> 00:47:55.600]   right? You're trying to teach batters how to read pitches coming out of the hands of pitchers,
[00:47:55.600 --> 00:47:59.520]   but you don't have that pitcher. So how do you do it? And the answer is that they have, they use VR
[00:47:59.520 --> 00:48:05.440]   to do pitch recognition and swing tracking and all these things, which again, it's not cheap,
[00:48:05.440 --> 00:48:09.840]   but it's cheaper than hiring pitchers or building a pitch machine that can do it. And you can have
[00:48:09.840 --> 00:48:13.520]   lots of people with headsets on, whereas you might only have a handful of batting cages.
[00:48:13.520 --> 00:48:17.600]   And it's for development. I don't think at the major league level as much, but for people who
[00:48:17.600 --> 00:48:21.920]   are in college or in the minors, they're using VR for this stuff too. So it's got a sports training
[00:48:21.920 --> 00:48:25.120]   angle as well. There's a lot of applications for this stuff. That's how you get an Aaron
[00:48:25.120 --> 00:48:32.080]   judge with that performance enhancing drugs. You put him in a VR helmet on. Yeah. Yeah. Interesting.
[00:48:32.080 --> 00:48:37.040]   So this is the, the, I'm sorry, I called it the HoloLens, the Quest Pro
[00:48:37.040 --> 00:48:47.760]   to specs, it's 1500 bucks. I mentioned that you get full colored mixed reality that three cameras
[00:48:47.760 --> 00:48:53.360]   in the controllers, wait a minute, says meta quest touch pro controllers includes three cameras
[00:48:53.360 --> 00:49:01.280]   and a Snapdragon 662 mobile processor per controller. Yeah. Wow. Next generation optics,
[00:49:01.920 --> 00:49:07.600]   the optical stack, they've slimmed down by 40% using our innovative patented pancake lens
[00:49:07.600 --> 00:49:12.800]   and optics technology. I did not watch Mark introduced this. Do watch the video this morning.
[00:49:12.800 --> 00:49:18.720]   I didn't watch the stream. I should have, which works by folding light inside the optical module,
[00:49:18.720 --> 00:49:24.880]   advanced VR LCD display technology, 37% greater pixels per inch. That's important, isn't it?
[00:49:25.600 --> 00:49:31.120]   You don't want to be able to see those pixels at a 1.3 times larger color gamut.
[00:49:31.120 --> 00:49:40.160]   They have considerable storage, 256 gig storage, 12 gigs of RAM. It's a Snapdragon XR2 plus processor.
[00:49:40.160 --> 00:49:46.880]   You know what I want, you know, since you've used the Quest 2 extensively, I think it'd be nice
[00:49:46.880 --> 00:49:51.440]   chasing if you came over and tried the row when it comes. It's supposed to, I'd love to do that.
[00:49:51.440 --> 00:49:56.160]   October 25th. I'd love to do that. Yeah. It's a Mac break weekly that day or something like that.
[00:49:56.160 --> 00:50:01.520]   And the Mac and the Mac break angle here as well is this, I think, is the headset that Apple's,
[00:50:01.520 --> 00:50:05.200]   you know, Apple reality or whatever they call it will be compared to. This is the competition.
[00:50:05.200 --> 00:50:11.440]   Yeah. I think that this will be the sort of what did Apple do versus what this particular product
[00:50:11.440 --> 00:50:16.160]   is because it is playing that, you know, similar rules, right, which is not worried about the price
[00:50:16.160 --> 00:50:21.760]   so much, but trying to figure out if, you know, what would be a productizable, high-end
[00:50:21.760 --> 00:50:25.280]   mixed reality headset today. And that's really interesting.
[00:50:25.280 --> 00:50:33.360]   You do not need a computer, but you do need a phone. iOS or Android. The Metacuest mobile app
[00:50:33.360 --> 00:50:38.560]   is your two-dimensional window into the world of VR. Use the Metacuest app to set up the headset,
[00:50:38.560 --> 00:50:44.240]   download content, update account info. So you control it. The good news is it's not tethered.
[00:50:45.600 --> 00:50:49.680]   The bad news is you do have to kind of use some computer to set it up. It's not going to
[00:50:49.680 --> 00:50:56.720]   do it on a stand-up. That's really smart. I think that's what asking it to process all that data
[00:50:56.720 --> 00:51:00.880]   with the frame rates at the resolution that they have the frequency that they need
[00:51:00.880 --> 00:51:07.840]   and not be this battery-horging heat sink on top of your face. That's a bigger problem than they
[00:51:07.840 --> 00:51:11.600]   can solve right now and top the other problems that have to solve. Being able to say, well,
[00:51:11.600 --> 00:51:15.440]   let's use another processor that someone's carrying their shirt pocket. That in itself
[00:51:15.440 --> 00:51:19.120]   is a really, really good step. I don't think that's what they're doing, though. I think that's just
[00:51:19.120 --> 00:51:23.920]   for setup and for connecting to, you know, for you. It's not using it to play the games, but you
[00:51:23.920 --> 00:51:29.920]   have to load them. That's why it has 256 gigs RAM. You have to get the game on your phone and then
[00:51:29.920 --> 00:51:38.960]   set it up to the Metacuest Pro. I've seen other units like this that are being done like most
[00:51:38.960 --> 00:51:44.160]   that are being done not necessarily on an experimental basis, but on a lab basis.
[00:51:44.160 --> 00:51:48.480]   And the thing when you read the papers that these people are writing about it,
[00:51:48.480 --> 00:51:53.840]   they're saying that we will give up, we will make any sacrifice whatsoever to maintain,
[00:51:53.840 --> 00:51:59.440]   to increase the frequency of how we're taking in data from the sensors and the problems that
[00:51:59.440 --> 00:52:04.000]   we're having just maintaining battery life and just maintaining a heat threshold that's tolerable
[00:52:04.000 --> 00:52:09.360]   are some of the limiting factors that they're dealing with. So I'll change my answer and say,
[00:52:09.360 --> 00:52:13.920]   I wouldn't be surprised. I wouldn't judge a VR AR headset maker for saying, guess what?
[00:52:13.920 --> 00:52:17.600]   You have to have a phone that has to have these qualifications and you have to have that in your
[00:52:17.600 --> 00:52:21.680]   shirt pocket at all times. Given that they're so focused on this Horizon Worlds thing, which is
[00:52:21.680 --> 00:52:26.480]   sort of like put your business life inside VR, which I'm skeptical of, but regardless of that,
[00:52:26.480 --> 00:52:32.240]   one of the things that it gets you is if you are pairing your phone to it, what they want you to do
[00:52:32.240 --> 00:52:37.440]   is if your text messages come in, if a call comes in, other information from the apps on your phone,
[00:52:37.440 --> 00:52:41.840]   when you've got the goggles on, what they want you to do is not take them off to check your phone.
[00:52:41.840 --> 00:52:47.440]   Right? So by pairing with your phone, they get to pipe all the stuff that's coming into you via
[00:52:47.440 --> 00:52:53.600]   your phone from the outside world into this headset without having to have you log into all of your
[00:52:53.600 --> 00:53:00.160]   stuff in the Horizon World or wherever you are. Yeah, and one of the things that go ahead, sorry,
[00:53:00.160 --> 00:53:03.200]   go ahead. All I'm going to say is that one of the things that we noticed when we started playing
[00:53:03.200 --> 00:53:07.280]   with some of this a couple of years ago was that you could take a lot of traditional broadcast
[00:53:07.280 --> 00:53:12.160]   and this is a real problem. People taking the headset on and off really, because it just never
[00:53:12.160 --> 00:53:16.320]   comes back the same way or it was always hard to get it to come back into the same state. It's not
[00:53:16.320 --> 00:53:19.520]   like you just lift it off and then pull it back in, you're back where you were, you've hit a bunch
[00:53:19.520 --> 00:53:24.000]   of buttons and do a bunch of other things. And so one of the things that we learned is A,
[00:53:24.000 --> 00:53:30.320]   how do we do golf? So we shot a lot of golf in 360. And the problem really was is that it wasn't
[00:53:30.320 --> 00:53:35.040]   that interesting to, you still kind of wanted to watch the show that's in 16 by nine, but if we took
[00:53:35.040 --> 00:53:38.400]   all the graphics that we were showing you in 16 by nine and put it off to the right,
[00:53:38.400 --> 00:53:42.960]   now anytime you want to see where people are, you look over and take a look and then go back to
[00:53:42.960 --> 00:53:46.000]   what you're watching. So now you have a clear aperture that you could sit there and watch and
[00:53:46.000 --> 00:53:50.880]   look at the data, but then we found that to the left, we started putting your text messages,
[00:53:50.880 --> 00:53:55.200]   your Twitter, everything else, you put it over there so that someone can interact with that when
[00:53:55.200 --> 00:53:59.360]   they want to, they can interact with a clean aperture and then they can interact with the data from the
[00:53:59.360 --> 00:54:04.960]   from the event. And so starting to use that data in a bunch of different ways, and it makes it much
[00:54:04.960 --> 00:54:08.560]   more immersive, even though it's not 360, it's much more immersive because you don't feel like you
[00:54:08.560 --> 00:54:13.360]   have to take you don't have to shift modes very often. We've seen recent studies that said the
[00:54:13.360 --> 00:54:18.080]   horizon worlds was so awful that men employees themselves were not you were not using it.
[00:54:18.080 --> 00:54:23.760]   But I'm told I haven't seen the presentation yet, but I'm told that you do now have legs.
[00:54:23.760 --> 00:54:28.960]   So that's that's a big step for goodness. I don't know if that's a feature. I know
[00:54:28.960 --> 00:54:33.120]   it was kind of nice to float around. I mean, I could float. I would float on the keynote was
[00:54:33.120 --> 00:54:39.120]   not live as far as I can tell it was streamed. It's a it's a I'm watching it right now. It's a video
[00:54:39.120 --> 00:54:46.400]   presentation. So they I think maybe learned from from Apple too, because remember that the
[00:54:46.400 --> 00:54:52.480]   keynote that Mark had everybody put on headsets and then he appeared and walked down the aisle
[00:54:52.480 --> 00:54:56.480]   and everybody thought it was extraordinarily creepy. I think they maybe learned yeah,
[00:54:56.480 --> 00:55:01.840]   learned a little bit. Oh, no legs, no legs. Sorry. There's still people without legs dancing. Oh,
[00:55:01.840 --> 00:55:07.280]   shoot. Yeah, I'm just to see this. This is why even Apple is that is it's a brave,
[00:55:07.280 --> 00:55:11.920]   brave move. It's natural from the dude. This seems like they could do really well. But the thing
[00:55:11.920 --> 00:55:16.640]   is like Apple has never done a product like this. They've never done a product where there isn't
[00:55:16.640 --> 00:55:22.320]   an existing product that people have already have already embraced and accepted and has already
[00:55:22.320 --> 00:55:27.920]   fulfilled a role in their lives. Nobody has a role in their lives for VR augmented reality.
[00:55:27.920 --> 00:55:31.600]   And the first step in this is not going to be getting the hardware out. It's going to be
[00:55:31.600 --> 00:55:36.560]   getting enough of the hardware out that developers are now playing with it. And they might and for
[00:55:36.560 --> 00:55:42.880]   them to find the app to find the service to find the role that will cause people to want to buy a
[00:55:42.880 --> 00:55:48.320]   or even $1,000 headset and to wear it regularly and to not take it off because they've got a text
[00:55:48.320 --> 00:55:52.160]   message or they've got something else going on in the real life. And the thing is they may not
[00:55:52.160 --> 00:55:56.960]   they may not find it developers might even Apple developers who are some of the most creative
[00:55:56.960 --> 00:56:00.960]   and insightful people. I'll say the most creative and insightful people who are coding for any
[00:56:00.960 --> 00:56:06.160]   popular platform. Even they they might come up some incredibly great games. They might come out with
[00:56:06.160 --> 00:56:12.960]   great training systems that go far beyond any existing corporate and industry and military
[00:56:12.960 --> 00:56:17.760]   training systems. But they may not find the thing that makes people think, wow, that is definitely
[00:56:17.760 --> 00:56:22.720]   going to be worth $1,000 of my money. And I'm definitely going to want to wear this out in public or
[00:56:22.720 --> 00:56:28.000]   even around the house that they may not solve that problem. I'll go so far as to say, you know,
[00:56:28.000 --> 00:56:32.880]   meta and Apple probably won't solve the problem. Right. So it really is incumbent on them to turn
[00:56:32.880 --> 00:56:37.680]   loose developers. And that's one of Apple's huge advantages, right, is that Apple has this pool of
[00:56:37.680 --> 00:56:43.920]   iPhone iOS developers that if they can take them and get them motivated to use this thing and to
[00:56:43.920 --> 00:56:48.880]   try it out, like, meta has already learned supernatural and beat Saber, right? Like, they're like, Oh,
[00:56:48.880 --> 00:56:52.160]   this is kind of a killer app. And they're like, we're going to buy them immediately. We need to buy
[00:56:52.160 --> 00:56:57.200]   them. But those are two good examples of apps that really hit and hit way more than anybody
[00:56:57.200 --> 00:57:01.760]   expected. And that is, that's what the developers bring to the table is that they're going to have
[00:57:01.760 --> 00:57:07.680]   the good idea that that's huge. So number one is not like this whole horizons thing that that
[00:57:07.680 --> 00:57:12.400]   Facebook is doing or meta is doing. Like, I don't know, they're trying to make it happen. But it
[00:57:12.400 --> 00:57:16.160]   really feels like the innovation that's going to make this stuff work is going to come from
[00:57:16.160 --> 00:57:20.960]   someone else. And then they're going to jump on it and buy it. Yeah. Well, and a lot of it is also
[00:57:20.960 --> 00:57:24.960]   to get back to what you're saying is the tools that Apple is slowly building reality, converter
[00:57:24.960 --> 00:57:29.680]   reality, creator, a lot of the, a lot of those bits and pieces to make things super easy to
[00:57:29.680 --> 00:57:34.560]   throw things together so that developers don't have to rethink that. But I think that Apple doesn't
[00:57:34.560 --> 00:57:40.000]   have all the developer tools yet, but they're really building this over years. You know, the
[00:57:40.000 --> 00:57:45.200]   process of getting USDZ, for instance, out there really makes a big difference because now you
[00:57:45.200 --> 00:57:50.400]   have a format that everyone can theoretically use to get all the stuff in there. And even by
[00:57:50.400 --> 00:57:54.800]   itself is interesting. I mean, when you look at being able to, I now have every once in a while,
[00:57:54.800 --> 00:57:58.640]   I'm on Amazon, I'm looking for something for the house and says, would you like to see this?
[00:57:58.640 --> 00:58:02.800]   And they're like, Oh, yeah, sure. And I hit the button and it appears at scale placed right
[00:58:02.800 --> 00:58:06.480]   where I, you know, I can decide where I want to place it. I was getting a new thing under my TV and
[00:58:06.480 --> 00:58:12.000]   to scale it, everything else just pops in. And those are the kinds of things that are coming that
[00:58:12.000 --> 00:58:16.480]   may not be something that you need to wear all the time, but something you may want to use it
[00:58:16.480 --> 00:58:22.720]   certain times. This will be a good test of the two different ways of developing, you know,
[00:58:22.720 --> 00:58:28.800]   Apple famously develops in secret and then reveals the cake fully baked. And that's clearly what
[00:58:28.800 --> 00:58:33.040]   they're doing here. They're putting out things, little bits and pieces, but there's got to be a
[00:58:33.040 --> 00:58:37.280]   lot behind the scenes that we don't know about. Whereas companies like Google, and I guess to
[00:58:37.280 --> 00:58:42.320]   some degree here, Meta are doing in public. I think there's an advantage to doing it in public.
[00:58:42.320 --> 00:58:47.520]   You get feedback, but you also get arrows in your back and look at Google with Google Glass,
[00:58:47.520 --> 00:58:53.920]   you know, that actually killed the effort for them. So it's it's it's actually bring that up because
[00:58:53.920 --> 00:58:58.400]   Warren Craddock, who's a Googler Google developer, he actually posted a real other couple of threads.
[00:58:58.400 --> 00:59:05.040]   Yeah, yeah, exactly. He worked on Google Glass. He also worked on LITRO and then the light field
[00:59:05.040 --> 00:59:10.320]   camera. He also worked on Google Clips. And he basically said that these were all like very
[00:59:10.320 --> 00:59:14.800]   researchy sort of things where they never figured out what are people actually going to use this
[00:59:14.800 --> 00:59:20.160]   for like what is it they all had a fatal flaw in them that the team basically said, well, we'll
[00:59:20.160 --> 00:59:26.080]   push forward. We'll fit in it. We'll figure this out all along the way or we will simply release
[00:59:26.080 --> 00:59:31.040]   this in some form and people will tell us what the purpose of this thing is Google Glass, which
[00:59:31.040 --> 00:59:34.640]   I which I always defend because I thought that one of the smartest one of the smartest things that
[00:59:34.640 --> 00:59:38.880]   Google did about this is not saying, Hey, we're releasing this as a commercial product by saying,
[00:59:38.880 --> 00:59:43.680]   we're releasing this as an experiment in limited numbers to people who are volunteering to try
[00:59:43.680 --> 00:59:49.120]   something that's kind of half big. And he's saying that part of their hopes was that if they release
[00:59:49.120 --> 00:59:54.720]   this and make this really, really easy to develop software for maybe the developers will find an
[00:59:54.720 --> 00:59:58.720]   app for this or a use for this that will well work out. And even they didn't find it. So
[00:59:58.720 --> 01:00:04.880]   but also Google cut. This is the problem that developers have. Sorry, if I'm in order,
[01:00:04.880 --> 01:00:13.360]   sorry. So the so I got Google Glass pretty pretty early on. And the thing is, is that they there
[01:00:13.360 --> 01:00:17.600]   was something that developers oftentimes will develop something and they don't know how to use
[01:00:17.600 --> 01:00:22.080]   it. Like they don't know what it's useful for. And and so they don't they're not paying attention.
[01:00:22.080 --> 01:00:24.720]   If you ask them like, what is this product for? They'll give you a bunch of garbage.
[01:00:24.720 --> 01:00:28.880]   That doesn't make you know, like that's what makes sense to them. But it's not condensed. So for
[01:00:28.880 --> 01:00:35.840]   instance, with glass, one of the most powerful things that it had was I can see what I'm shooting
[01:00:35.840 --> 01:00:40.000]   and I can see theoretically you if you were on Hangouts, but they very quickly turned Hangouts
[01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:43.360]   off because they're afraid people do bad things with it. And so they turned off the thing that was
[01:00:43.360 --> 01:00:47.920]   like, because when we did it as a test, where I can sit there and show you how to use a camera,
[01:00:47.920 --> 01:00:50.720]   and I can show you how to do something and you can see me and I can see you and I know,
[01:00:50.720 --> 01:00:54.640]   no, no, don't do it that way. Do it this way. It was like this opening up this thing and that
[01:00:54.640 --> 01:01:01.360]   no one's ever really opened again. And the because other people have done it, but it's all it's just
[01:01:01.360 --> 01:01:07.120]   clunky, you know, the glass was something that just worked. And then the other thing was is that
[01:01:07.120 --> 01:01:13.920]   when you say, okay, take a video, the the ability to shoot point of view training and videos on
[01:01:13.920 --> 01:01:19.120]   what you're doing was nothing's gotten close to glass, in my opinion. There's a lot of headset
[01:01:19.120 --> 01:01:23.120]   based things that I've tested and you know, none of them are as good as as what it was.
[01:01:23.120 --> 01:01:26.320]   And so they had things that were really killer and that could have been promoted,
[01:01:26.320 --> 01:01:30.080]   but then they promoted all those other stuff that wasn't particularly useful or interesting.
[01:01:30.080 --> 01:01:33.200]   Yeah, they didn't they didn't have the story straight, but what I loved about it,
[01:01:33.200 --> 01:01:37.520]   I'm talking about from the moment I got I picked him up, I picked him up in a suite in
[01:01:37.520 --> 01:01:42.800]   New York City. An hour later, I was taking a walk through Central Park and I immediately was so
[01:01:42.800 --> 01:01:48.240]   enraptured by the idea that I have this tiny little display that when I need it, it appears like
[01:01:48.240 --> 01:01:52.880]   when I want to take a note about something, it appears and then it disappears and now it's completely
[01:01:52.880 --> 01:01:56.960]   out of my field of vision and I don't care about it. But Warren Craddock was talking about things
[01:01:56.960 --> 01:02:01.840]   like they couldn't get around the fact that you look like a goofball wearing it. And then there
[01:02:01.840 --> 01:02:05.760]   was never anything that was so good about it that it would say it's worth me looking like a goofball
[01:02:05.760 --> 01:02:10.560]   walking through Central Park, wearing this thing on my face. Yeah, so but but but this is going to
[01:02:10.560 --> 01:02:14.000]   take a lot of experimentation. His point in this tweet storm, which is really worth reading,
[01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:18.160]   I was I was saving it for tomorrow for this week in Google. We'll talk about it today too,
[01:02:18.160 --> 01:02:24.080]   was that engineering teams kind of drink the Kool-Aid, they get so invested in their product that they
[01:02:24.080 --> 01:02:31.200]   don't see what is an obvious fatal flaw in the product. I think of the Segway, which is a very
[01:02:31.200 --> 01:02:36.560]   cool product, but you look like an utter dork on it because you're six, you're eight feet tall.
[01:02:36.560 --> 01:02:41.600]   And so the people, you know, people who saw it were all enamored of it, but really kind of didn't
[01:02:41.600 --> 01:02:47.760]   see the forest for the trees. He mentions Google clips, which we remember that it was a little box.
[01:02:48.240 --> 01:02:52.320]   Yeah, clip it on. I got one too. And it would take pictures of your life and then you would have a
[01:02:52.320 --> 01:02:57.360]   photo of your life. Weird pictures. Well, that's what he says. He says, yeah, nobody paid any attention
[01:02:57.360 --> 01:03:02.880]   the fact that the angle that you're taking the pictures from was not a normal place. And so you
[01:03:02.880 --> 01:03:07.760]   were getting weird pictures because when we take pictures, we take it from eye view, not chest view.
[01:03:07.760 --> 01:03:13.360]   And he said, that was obvious from day one. And they never solved it. And you know, he says it was
[01:03:13.360 --> 01:03:18.720]   obvious from day one, that Google Glass looked dorky and didn't do anything that useful. And
[01:03:18.720 --> 01:03:25.840]   Google never found a killer app for glass. So his point is well taken. I think that, you know,
[01:03:25.840 --> 01:03:30.320]   this is, but this is why you have a company. You don't have, you know, that often these little
[01:03:30.320 --> 01:03:36.080]   startups do best. And you mentioned this, Jason, that probably somebody will reinvent, you know,
[01:03:36.080 --> 01:03:40.080]   a meta world and meta will buy it because they'll do it better. These little companies have the
[01:03:40.080 --> 01:03:46.160]   passion to do it. But it takes kind of an outside eye to turn it to really turn it into something
[01:03:46.160 --> 01:03:51.920]   of value. You also, they also see the, I think the problem particularly with with with Zuckerberg
[01:03:51.920 --> 01:03:59.520]   is that he really Zuckerberg and Elon Musk, they have like billionaires, psychopath syndrome,
[01:03:59.520 --> 01:04:05.360]   which is all I have to do is to stamp my staff into the ground, the lightning will form and
[01:04:05.360 --> 01:04:10.640]   off from the ground will smoke this vision of reality that I am promoting. And it's like,
[01:04:10.640 --> 01:04:14.000]   no one is going to do that. No one's going to come and you switch their entire business to your
[01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:18.480]   metaverse simply because you are smoking, you are doing all these demonstrations about how
[01:04:18.480 --> 01:04:23.120]   all the futures in the metaverse and we're investing in the metaverse. Good for you. Just
[01:04:23.120 --> 01:04:27.040]   just like you can say, I'm going to build an army of humanoid robots that are going to take the
[01:04:27.040 --> 01:04:34.080]   place of laborers, they're going to cost $20,000 to $30,000. Again, good for you, Elon. I'm glad
[01:04:34.080 --> 01:04:39.520]   you're excited about this. I'm glad you're employing people who and that's why to work this, but
[01:04:39.520 --> 01:04:43.040]   that's why we give a lot of credit to Steve Jobs because I think he was that outside eye
[01:04:43.040 --> 01:04:48.160]   who could say that's crap. Don't do that. I don't like that. And of course he had the power to
[01:04:48.160 --> 01:04:53.680]   enforce it. And I think that made a big difference. He had good taste. And he had good taste.
[01:04:53.680 --> 01:04:56.640]   You know, like the thing is, so I think that the thing, and there's a lot of people that would
[01:04:56.640 --> 01:04:59.360]   do a lot of things if you gave them a lot of money. And so we just get to see what there's
[01:04:59.360 --> 01:05:02.400]   some people who you give them a lot of money and they're going to go, well, this is what I really
[01:05:02.400 --> 01:05:10.080]   believe is going to happen. But it does take the co-illating of a lot of people to do it.
[01:05:10.080 --> 01:05:15.440]   You do have to sell it. And sometimes you have to be willing to sell it for many years to get it
[01:05:15.440 --> 01:05:21.360]   off the ground. And so it does make sense that they're trying to do that, but they also have to
[01:05:21.360 --> 01:05:24.800]   have something that actually, I think Apple's pretty good at following the route with things
[01:05:24.800 --> 01:05:28.800]   that actually do that. Yeah, has to scratch an itch. They're announcing things like the
[01:05:28.800 --> 01:05:34.240]   Horizon Worlds will now be in the web. So you don't have to, you know, it's incremental progress.
[01:05:34.240 --> 01:05:38.640]   I think that's interesting. And you know, I bought the very first, I did the Kickstarter for the
[01:05:38.640 --> 01:05:44.800]   Oculus, the very first Oculus, and used that and got a sense of it, didn't keep using it.
[01:05:44.800 --> 01:05:51.760]   Michael has the Vive and we also got the Quest 2 for him because I don't have a Facebook account.
[01:05:51.760 --> 01:05:55.680]   Now that I can use it with a meta account, I think it's time to look at it once again. And I know
[01:05:55.680 --> 01:05:59.600]   it will be done. I know it'll be another, you know, maybe in five years, we'll look at it once again.
[01:05:59.600 --> 01:06:01.920]   Right. And we'll have made it more leaps along that.
[01:06:01.920 --> 01:06:05.360]   I think the problem for me is that I'm nearsighted. And I don't want to change the lenses out because
[01:06:05.360 --> 01:06:09.280]   people will use it. And so it destroyed one of my glasses because I was wearing it, I was doing it
[01:06:09.280 --> 01:06:12.960]   every day. And I was like, I don't want to do this anymore. And what's, I think the first question is,
[01:06:12.960 --> 01:06:18.080]   Jason, how do you do that? I bought the lenses that you pop on top and so you can take your
[01:06:18.080 --> 01:06:22.160]   glasses off and use it. And then yeah, if you've got somebody else using it, you got to pop them
[01:06:22.160 --> 01:06:26.480]   back off again. It's definitely an issue. You know, it's like, I just like, there's nausea,
[01:06:26.480 --> 01:06:30.400]   there's another issue, you know, and there's a lot of issues. I had part one that I had the gear,
[01:06:30.400 --> 01:06:34.800]   and all I had to do with the gear is move the little dial and I was, I was in focus. You know,
[01:06:34.800 --> 01:06:38.720]   like, so the problem was I knew that something else existed. So every time I put the oculus on,
[01:06:38.720 --> 01:06:41.840]   I was like, I don't understand why they didn't give me diopters. You know, like, I didn't,
[01:06:41.840 --> 01:06:44.880]   like, I just every time I put it on, I was angry, you know, and so that I just was like,
[01:06:44.880 --> 01:06:50.400]   every time I put it on, I was nauseated. So, you know, similar. Jason, you like it, though.
[01:06:50.400 --> 01:06:54.080]   You keep, you're still playing with the quest. Yeah, it's fun. I mean, it's a novel team more
[01:06:54.080 --> 01:06:58.880]   than anything else. But it is my big, my big issues with it are that you've got to have, like,
[01:06:58.880 --> 01:07:03.920]   look, again, we mentioned earlier, I live in Southern Marin, I live in a small 1950s,
[01:07:03.920 --> 01:07:11.760]   tracked home. I don't have the space to play virtual ping pong without moving furniture, right?
[01:07:11.760 --> 01:07:16.000]   That becomes a, it's a problem that actually, and I think that that will be an issue if this does
[01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:20.400]   become big. It's like, remember when the Wii came out and they said, well, now you need to clear
[01:07:20.400 --> 01:07:26.240]   a six by eight area in order to play. I don't like, who has a six by eight foot area empty
[01:07:26.240 --> 01:07:31.040]   to play video games in? And that's the biggest problem I have is I have to move stuff around in
[01:07:31.040 --> 01:07:36.320]   my house. But it's fun. I have to mention, I have to mention, I have to mention, I mentioned
[01:07:36.320 --> 01:07:41.600]   a plug. There is a Reddit called VR to ER. That's nothing but pictures of injuries, injuries
[01:07:41.600 --> 01:07:46.000]   inflicted by, like, not being, what thinking you swing your lights over and hitting a lap and
[01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:49.840]   breaking your hand? I have to say, one of the things that I found most impressive about the
[01:07:49.840 --> 01:07:54.480]   quest to is how they handle that, that they have you sketch out using the mixed reality road,
[01:07:54.480 --> 01:07:59.760]   sketch out the safe spaces. And then it also is recognizing protruding objects. And it, it, it,
[01:07:59.760 --> 01:08:05.840]   like, starts to put like a red circle, like this is danger, you're getting too close to the danger
[01:08:05.840 --> 01:08:10.480]   zone. And if you go through the danger zone, it actually drops you into mixed reality. So it's,
[01:08:10.480 --> 01:08:15.920]   like, Hey, dummy, there's a thing there. Don't do that. So it's pretty good at that. But the, the
[01:08:15.920 --> 01:08:20.720]   issue remains where like, it's very hard to play ping pong. And seriously, 11 table tennis on the
[01:08:20.720 --> 01:08:26.480]   quest to is amazing. It really is very, very good virtual ping pong. But if you can't go to your
[01:08:26.480 --> 01:08:31.200]   right beyond about like, you know, four feet, because there's a bookshelf there or a wall is like,
[01:08:31.200 --> 01:08:35.200]   it's hard. It's bad for your game is why I'm saying it's bad for your table tennis game.
[01:08:35.200 --> 01:08:40.240]   One other minor point. I'm looking at the meta keynote from earlier today, just ended right before
[01:08:40.240 --> 01:08:47.360]   we began. And they're making a kind of a pointed, so I think that that's got to be a Mac book sitting
[01:08:47.360 --> 01:08:54.560]   on the table there. And I think that it's very clearly neither a Google pixel watch,
[01:08:54.560 --> 01:09:02.080]   nor an apple watch. That's a real watch on that guy's wrist. So I think meta is taking great
[01:09:02.080 --> 01:09:06.640]   pains to make sure that you don't think they use any apple proxy. Then though, I think by far,
[01:09:06.640 --> 01:09:12.480]   they use more max than anything else. All right, let's take a little break. Lots more to talk about
[01:09:12.480 --> 01:09:22.880]   Andy and I co is here W G B H in Boston. Alex Lindsey from 090.media and office hours.global
[01:09:22.880 --> 01:09:28.880]   and from six colors.com. The great Jason Snell, you're getting ready your your finger trigger
[01:09:28.880 --> 01:09:36.080]   fingers on the color graphs button for the October 27th. Yeah, I got my charts scripts all warmed up
[01:09:36.080 --> 01:09:39.680]   and ready to update those over time or you just kind of it works.
[01:09:39.680 --> 01:09:46.720]   Until that until something screws up then. Yeah, but but it's good that it's automated to the
[01:09:46.720 --> 01:09:50.640]   point now where I have to put in the numbers and then I run one script and it outputs all the data,
[01:09:50.640 --> 01:09:56.000]   which is beautiful thing. Beautiful thing. It actually brings us to our sponsor for the
[01:09:56.000 --> 01:10:01.920]   our worldwide technology. If you're in business, when technology works to support your business
[01:10:01.920 --> 01:10:07.760]   strategy, it's a beautiful, beautiful thing. And that's what W W T is all about. They're at the
[01:10:07.760 --> 01:10:12.160]   forefront of innovation, working with clients all over the world to transform their businesses
[01:10:12.160 --> 01:10:18.320]   with technology. But it's and I always emphasize this. They are business people. So they understand
[01:10:18.320 --> 01:10:23.200]   that it has to support your business is not technology for technology's sake. Yeah,
[01:10:23.200 --> 01:10:28.000]   they're technologists. They're technologists who understand business and it all starts at their
[01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:34.800]   ATC their advanced technology center. Lisa and I went out and visited it. March 2020.
[01:10:34.800 --> 01:10:42.320]   The last trip. It was an amazing thing though. I was so glad we went out. It started 10 years
[01:10:42.320 --> 01:10:48.960]   ago, one little building, a couple of racks. It now spans multiple buildings, many, many racks,
[01:10:48.960 --> 01:10:56.640]   half a billion dollars of state of the art enterprise gear in the lab from all the leading OEMs and
[01:10:57.200 --> 01:11:03.280]   all the all the disruptors, everybody you'd want to know about. Of course, W W T's engineers use
[01:11:03.280 --> 01:11:09.360]   these amazing facilities, this incredible advanced technology center to spin up proofs of concepts
[01:11:09.360 --> 01:11:14.880]   to do pilots for their customers to learn about new technologies to see which technologies integrate
[01:11:14.880 --> 01:11:22.000]   well. It's great for W W T helps cut evaluation time from months to weeks. But starting last year,
[01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:29.040]   they started doing something really cool. They opened up the ATC to you to anybody for free.
[01:11:29.040 --> 01:11:35.200]   The ATC advanced technology center offers hundreds of on demand and schedulable labs,
[01:11:35.200 --> 01:11:40.640]   featuring solutions that include technologies representing the latest advances, the newest
[01:11:40.640 --> 01:11:46.880]   stuff in cloud and security, networking, primary and secondary storage and data analytics in AI
[01:11:46.880 --> 01:11:52.960]   and DevOps and so much more. And now you can use it to test out products and solutions before you go
[01:11:52.960 --> 01:11:58.160]   to market to get tech. It's not just the labs, you get technical articles, expert insights.
[01:11:58.160 --> 01:12:04.640]   You could see demonstration videos and white papers, all the tools you need in your business to stay
[01:12:04.640 --> 01:12:10.080]   up to date with the latest technology. And because W W T has virtualized the advanced technology
[01:12:10.080 --> 01:12:16.640]   center members of the ATC platform can access these resources anywhere in the world, 365 days
[01:12:16.640 --> 01:12:22.640]   a year. While you're in the ATC, you want to check out W W T's events and communities too,
[01:12:22.640 --> 01:12:26.640]   because they do so many interesting things. We went out there and marched to do an event that
[01:12:26.640 --> 01:12:33.440]   was really cool. A lot of fun. Mary Jo Foley joined us as a matter of fact. So but they're doing this
[01:12:33.440 --> 01:12:38.640]   all the time with very smart people in the arena so that you can learn about technology trends.
[01:12:38.640 --> 01:12:43.520]   You can hear about the latest research, get insights from their experts. It's really a community. I
[01:12:43.520 --> 01:12:49.120]   think that's the thing to emphasize a community of like-minded people, all of whom are trying to
[01:12:49.120 --> 01:12:55.280]   understand what's going on in technology and how it can further their business. W W T is the
[01:12:55.280 --> 01:13:01.440]   partner you need. Whatever your business needs, they can deliver scalable, tried and tested tailored
[01:13:01.440 --> 01:13:07.600]   solutions to meet your strategy. W W T brings strategy and execution together to make this
[01:13:07.600 --> 01:13:14.640]   exciting new world happen to learn more about W W T the ATC to gain access to all these resources
[01:13:14.640 --> 01:13:24.320]   free free free free go to www.wt.com/twit. We love these guys. They are just doing some amazing stuff.
[01:13:24.320 --> 01:13:28.720]   And man, if you get a chance ever to get to St. Louis to see the ATC, I highly recommend it.
[01:13:28.720 --> 01:13:33.360]   It's amazing. But you could do it virtually if you create a free account on the Advanced
[01:13:33.360 --> 01:13:39.760]   Technology Center platform. Just go to www.wt.com/twit. We thank them so much for their support.
[01:13:39.760 --> 01:13:46.480]   Of all of our shows, you support us, dear listener, by going to www.wt.com/twit. That lets
[01:13:46.480 --> 01:13:54.640]   them know you saw it here. It's very important. So please use that address. www.wt.com/twit.
[01:13:56.240 --> 01:14:06.480]   Okay, enough Oculus jealousy and this Oculus envy. Looks like according to Mr. G,
[01:14:06.480 --> 01:14:11.600]   Mark Gurman. I'm not done, Leo. I'm not done. I'm still looking for are we on?
[01:14:11.600 --> 01:14:18.960]   What on my headset? But I'm not seeing anything. It's Jordy. Are we not in VR?
[01:14:18.960 --> 01:14:24.080]   At least put some of those sticky googly eyes on so we can think that you're still looking at us.
[01:14:24.080 --> 01:14:30.800]   That's a good idea. Okay, I'll do that on my pros. We'll do it in post. Okay, Jason now has
[01:14:30.800 --> 01:14:36.560]   disappeared. I don't know. Did he lose his legs? Did he fall off the chair and he can't get up?
[01:14:36.560 --> 01:14:40.240]   Well, he got attracted to one of those red zones he talked about. Zuckerberg said,
[01:14:40.240 --> 01:14:43.840]   "The number one thing people ask of us is legs."
[01:14:43.840 --> 01:14:50.880]   I fell on the floor and didn't have legs. I couldn't get up. What was happening there?
[01:14:50.880 --> 01:14:56.480]   They didn't say what, but they are working on legs at some point.
[01:14:56.480 --> 01:15:01.920]   Well, that's because it's hard to stand without them. Yeah. Somebody in the chat room is telling me
[01:15:01.920 --> 01:15:09.680]   that a famous Mexican actor, Vic 867 is telling us a famous Mexican actor who came out in Kota
[01:15:09.680 --> 01:15:15.600]   movie, Eugenio Derbez fractured his elbow and shoulder while playing in VR with his kid.
[01:15:17.840 --> 01:15:23.440]   You got to have space if you don't have the space. It's going to be bad. Can't play the game without
[01:15:23.440 --> 01:15:32.800]   the space. According to Mr. G, we will get iPad OS 16 one two days before the event, the Apple,
[01:15:32.800 --> 01:15:36.400]   not event, the Apple earnings report, October 24 or three days before.
[01:15:40.080 --> 01:15:49.120]   We just got an update to iOS 16. It's 16.03 now. I don't know what's a bunch of things.
[01:15:49.120 --> 01:15:52.560]   A bunch of new data dropped again. They're in the weekly beta cycle, which really tells you that
[01:15:52.560 --> 01:15:55.200]   it's coming. It's coming real soon.
[01:15:55.200 --> 01:16:02.560]   That's interesting if you try to extrapolate that though. What hardware releases could they
[01:16:02.560 --> 01:16:11.200]   make in October that would make that timely? If there are features that are coming out in Ventura
[01:16:11.200 --> 01:16:21.600]   that are also mirrored in iPad OS and they weren't available in iPad OS 16, if they're releasing 16.1
[01:16:21.600 --> 01:16:26.160]   on a certain on the third week of October, does that not imply that Ventura will be coming out
[01:16:26.160 --> 01:16:31.760]   at around the same time? Or is that just ruthless speculation?
[01:16:31.760 --> 01:16:36.720]   Well, I'm going to make a prediction that stage manager, which is I think the main reason that
[01:16:36.720 --> 01:16:42.800]   iPad OS hasn't come out and will be on Ventura, is going to be a miserable flop. I know you love
[01:16:42.800 --> 01:16:49.120]   it, Jason. Love is too strong a word for it. It is a mode. That's the beauty of it is. It's a mode
[01:16:49.120 --> 01:16:55.440]   so they can sort of leave it off and not even promote it and ship it and sort of work on it again.
[01:16:55.440 --> 01:17:01.440]   But I think that's what happens hiding. It's a real niche. I don't think they want to talk about it.
[01:17:01.440 --> 01:17:08.400]   Yeah, I mean, I am all in on every operating system, Windows, Mac, and Linux with workspaces.
[01:17:08.400 --> 01:17:14.080]   The idea that you have a whole screen with either one big window or a number of windows that you
[01:17:14.080 --> 01:17:19.440]   use. In fact, I'm using it right now. If I've got my browser in this screen and I can,
[01:17:19.440 --> 01:17:25.360]   you could show my screen real quick, John Ashley. So I got my browser there. I've got my copy
[01:17:25.360 --> 01:17:30.960]   there. I've got my Slack there. I've got the chat there. I've got the Discord there. There's an empty
[01:17:30.960 --> 01:17:36.160]   workspace. That's a really, and then I could see a virtual view of all the workspaces. That's a nice
[01:17:36.160 --> 01:17:41.760]   way to work. And I do that on the Mac, mostly full screen, but not always. And I do it on Linux.
[01:17:41.760 --> 01:17:51.520]   But I don't need stage manager to do this. So I'm all in on the idea of virtual works of workspaces.
[01:17:51.520 --> 01:17:58.560]   I think that's a good thing. I think occupying a huge 10% of the screen with these chunks that
[01:17:58.560 --> 01:18:02.640]   demonstrate show you the things you've got open in a workspace. Well, it's not useful.
[01:18:02.640 --> 01:18:06.000]   You can turn that on. I know it does something over.
[01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:10.880]   See what I have here. I kind of had the same thing. This is this is how
[01:18:10.880 --> 01:18:18.320]   GNOME desktop and Linux does it. Microsoft Windows has a similar thing in the in the taskbar.
[01:18:19.280 --> 01:18:24.320]   That's fine for me. That's what Mac OS has space as that spaces things. So I think that's
[01:18:24.320 --> 01:18:30.240]   sufficient. So I'm wondering what what problems space stages solves.
[01:18:30.240 --> 01:18:37.520]   Well, it might just simply as simple as there are people for whom spaces is not an instinctive
[01:18:37.520 --> 01:18:44.400]   sort of way to manage their workflow. And that I have to myth of that's I am in that category.
[01:18:44.400 --> 01:18:52.720]   Like I see how right it is. I see how efficient it is. But I just can't get my mindset adapted to
[01:18:52.720 --> 01:18:59.680]   away from I have one window or a bunch of screens that I get to see all of my overlapping windows
[01:18:59.680 --> 01:19:06.400]   at the same time. I can't get my head into a certain space where all of my windows associated
[01:19:06.400 --> 01:19:10.720]   to a certain task always being in the same place. And there are very, very few apps for which
[01:19:11.360 --> 01:19:16.400]   operating them in full screen mode in their entire space makes more sense than just simply putting
[01:19:16.400 --> 01:19:21.680]   it somewhere in the scrum and then just command tabbing my way into it when I need it. So I
[01:19:21.680 --> 01:19:27.360]   love the fact that Apple is not necessarily saying that this is this is how things shall
[01:19:27.360 --> 01:19:32.960]   be from from all day this day forward again. No insane billionaire megalomaniac disease here.
[01:19:32.960 --> 01:19:38.000]   It's like no, we're we're keeping spaces as it is. We're adding this other thing because people
[01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:43.360]   might have a better time with it, particularly I can I've played with it. Again, I don't I only
[01:19:43.360 --> 01:19:50.000]   have one iPad that can run the beta. So I don't have it installed on my on my Mac on my iPad Pro,
[01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:55.760]   but I have used it. And I can see myself using that a lot on the iPad where it's taken up a lot
[01:19:55.760 --> 01:20:02.000]   more of the screen relative to having this big, you know, my big Stonehenge array of screens in
[01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:07.600]   front of me right now. But it would help me to get around on that iPad a lot faster. So I'm
[01:20:07.600 --> 01:20:12.560]   really excited to see if I wind up using it a lot more than I would use spaces once it finally gets
[01:20:12.560 --> 01:20:19.040]   released. Yeah, I think the challenge on the on the iPad is how do you do windowing because there are
[01:20:19.040 --> 01:20:25.520]   multiple multiple layers of windows is a very tried and true way of multitasking on the Mac
[01:20:25.520 --> 01:20:30.160]   and on Windows. And the iPad doesn't have that concept. It only has this sort of very simple
[01:20:30.160 --> 01:20:36.080]   tiling concept. I feel like stage manager, you know, as an organizational system is one thing.
[01:20:36.080 --> 01:20:43.040]   And then there's just multi window on the iPad is the other part of this. And it has some use on
[01:20:43.040 --> 01:20:48.400]   iPad Pro, especially the larger one on an external display, you really have to have floating windows
[01:20:48.400 --> 01:20:51.840]   because tiling on a large external display, you're going to have these huge apps. And it doesn't
[01:20:51.840 --> 01:20:56.480]   really make any sense. I think the challenge is that they have to invent a windowing system on the
[01:20:56.480 --> 01:21:01.520]   iPad that doesn't exist. And then it's all yoked to stage manager, which is not fully formed even
[01:21:01.520 --> 01:21:06.640]   itself in terms of the keyboard shortcuts and showing and hiding things. And actually, my biggest
[01:21:06.640 --> 01:21:12.800]   frustration with stage manager on iPad is it they said, let's do free form windows, but not too
[01:21:12.800 --> 01:21:19.200]   free form. So you can't actually put the window where you want it to go exactly around. And I like,
[01:21:19.200 --> 01:21:24.720]   I don't understand why you would even bother with free form windows. If they can't be free form,
[01:21:24.720 --> 01:21:30.160]   then why didn't you just do a tiling system on the Mac stage manager has a, I would say,
[01:21:30.160 --> 01:21:34.160]   a different problem with which is the this larger problem of stage manager, which is,
[01:21:34.160 --> 01:21:39.040]   you know, it is, I think it's too complicated. I think you end up spending too much time moving
[01:21:39.040 --> 01:21:42.880]   windows around and managing windows instead of doing your work. And if it's supposed to be
[01:21:42.880 --> 01:21:47.920]   saving me time, it should make it, you know, I shouldn't click a link and have it open in a
[01:21:47.920 --> 01:21:52.240]   different place. Spaces is like this too, by the way. And then you're like, wait a second,
[01:21:52.240 --> 01:21:56.560]   but I was working over there. And now I'm over here. And then you have to switch back. And then
[01:21:56.560 --> 01:22:00.720]   you have to move that one and drag it back in. And you're doing all this window management's like,
[01:22:00.720 --> 01:22:05.920]   well, you know, what I'm really good at is having all the windows open at once and then clicking on
[01:22:05.920 --> 01:22:12.000]   the one on one, which is how the Mac is worked since 1984. Yeah, one thing that I think that a lot of
[01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:17.200]   a lot of us makers and air face makers are becoming aware of that there are there is such a, such a
[01:22:17.200 --> 01:22:23.840]   variety of neurodiversity amongst users that what if someone has ADHD to one degree or another? What
[01:22:23.840 --> 01:22:30.160]   if people have problems observing basically tracking the movement of a moving object from one space
[01:22:30.160 --> 01:22:36.160]   to another or even have a problem with what I've just, I don't want to say object permanence,
[01:22:36.160 --> 01:22:39.440]   because that's a specific term. But but that's the sort of thing I'm talking about where wait a
[01:22:39.440 --> 01:22:44.880]   minute, I was here and now I've been teleported to this other place. Where am I relative to where
[01:22:44.880 --> 01:22:49.440]   my workspace was that other time? And now is rather than simply rather than simply saying,
[01:22:49.440 --> 01:22:53.760]   here is your burger going to go ahead and eat it, you have to basically say, we're going to give
[01:22:53.760 --> 01:22:59.920]   you lots of different solutions to the problems of managing eight, nine, 10, 11 tasks across
[01:22:59.920 --> 01:23:06.080]   10 or 20 different apps and windows. We're going to let you find your own solution to the thing.
[01:23:06.080 --> 01:23:10.880]   I mean, oddly enough, I don't think that tiling on the iPad is a terrible idea. I like the fact that
[01:23:10.880 --> 01:23:16.720]   I can have multiple views and not have to keep managing keeping all both of these apps and both
[01:23:16.720 --> 01:23:22.880]   these functions visible at the same time. I actually, I have like a system extensions that will on my
[01:23:22.880 --> 01:23:28.080]   Mac that let me just get a copy that windows behavior of if I drag this to the edge, we'll just
[01:23:28.080 --> 01:23:33.360]   simply snap to one half of the of this display. I would love to have a tiling window manager for
[01:23:33.360 --> 01:23:39.200]   for the Mac. I would probably use spaces if I had access to in this space, all windows windows do
[01:23:39.200 --> 01:23:44.080]   not overlap. They automatically tile as very, very easy to basically pocket something into one
[01:23:44.080 --> 01:23:48.720]   quarter of the screen by simply dragging it into place. It's it's not a simple it's not a simple
[01:23:48.720 --> 01:23:54.080]   thing. And I don't expect Apple to solve stage manager in the first in the first release.
[01:23:54.080 --> 01:23:57.440]   I hope that they keep nurturing it and keep developing and listening to people.
[01:23:57.440 --> 01:24:02.080]   Yeah. Because a year to a year from now, two years from now, it could be absolute absolute
[01:24:02.080 --> 01:24:05.760]   Tabasco for the for the Mac. And I think that it'll be interesting to see how many people use it.
[01:24:05.760 --> 01:24:10.880]   Like I don't I don't use spaces at all. I just don't like I don't like it, you know, and I don't.
[01:24:10.880 --> 01:24:14.080]   So it doesn't mean anything like a lot of this stuff. I'm like, okay, well, I mean, I like to be
[01:24:14.080 --> 01:24:17.920]   able to split my screen on my iPad occasionally. But outside of that, you know, I don't even like
[01:24:17.920 --> 01:24:22.720]   notifications. So so I think that I'm very curious to see, you know, what the uptake,
[01:24:22.720 --> 01:24:28.080]   you know, is in general of the average user. So we have a lot of these things for power users. And
[01:24:28.080 --> 01:24:32.080]   I'm going to guess that from my own experience, people I've talked to that it's actually pretty
[01:24:32.080 --> 01:24:37.040]   small percentage of the of the overall users use a lot of this feature specifically.
[01:24:37.040 --> 01:24:42.080]   Even on a laptop, I use full screen and workspaces all the time, but I don't,
[01:24:42.080 --> 01:24:46.320]   yeah, I don't go into spaces because unless I need to figure out where something is or drag it
[01:24:46.320 --> 01:24:50.080]   around, we're talking about end up in spaces is by accident. And then I'm always like, well,
[01:24:50.080 --> 01:24:53.280]   yeah, like I said, how do I get back and so I don't do this. Yeah, I don't.
[01:24:53.280 --> 01:24:58.080]   So I only knew it once in a while when I have to mostly I'm just going back of control left,
[01:24:58.080 --> 01:25:02.880]   right arrow going back and forth. So we have a large diversity of opinion here about these
[01:25:02.880 --> 01:25:08.880]   features. And we are a group of older white men, right? So not a lot of demographic diversity here.
[01:25:08.880 --> 01:25:13.680]   And yet, I think for really different feet, I think we're all power users is what's
[01:25:13.680 --> 01:25:18.720]   and that's well, no, but and yet somehow our users are like super into spaces and I hate
[01:25:18.720 --> 01:25:22.800]   spaces and wouldn't use them if you force them on me. And I think this is one of the challenges in
[01:25:22.800 --> 01:25:28.160]   saying, well, what how is stage manager? Does it succeed or does it fail? And the answer is,
[01:25:28.160 --> 01:25:31.440]   I think even if it succeeds, only about 5% of the users will use it. Right.
[01:25:31.440 --> 01:25:37.040]   Right. I think the real risk is that apples put a lot of attention on it. And it's clearly
[01:25:37.040 --> 01:25:44.080]   troubled. That's why they had to push back iPad OS. They've got to release it now if they release
[01:25:44.080 --> 01:25:49.920]   new iPads. And I think it may not be ready. Frederica Vicicci trying the new beta tweeted this
[01:25:49.920 --> 01:25:57.040]   morning is there all sorts of problems with it. And this is this is this beta has got to be close
[01:25:57.040 --> 01:26:02.000]   to the final release. If not, it feels like it feels like it. I mean, the good news for Apple is
[01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:06.320]   that it's a mode that's off by default. And I think that that is good for them. That's very,
[01:26:06.320 --> 01:26:10.400]   very good. And that they took the they took the external display support out. And that might seem
[01:26:10.400 --> 01:26:16.880]   a little weird. But I actually think stage manager is best on an external display. So they're actually
[01:26:16.880 --> 01:26:24.560]   reducing the the chance that somebody is going to encounter stage manager unawares at any scenario
[01:26:24.560 --> 01:26:28.880]   or be motivated to use stage manager. And that gives them a little breathing room, I think.
[01:26:28.880 --> 01:26:34.640]   Yeah. Yeah. And this is this is an indicate another illustration of why the one if I have very few
[01:26:34.640 --> 01:26:39.840]   like triggering phrases when it comes to like discussion of tech topics is like when someone
[01:26:39.840 --> 01:26:44.240]   dismisses someone's complaint, it's like, Oh, nobody uses that feature or nobody uses nobody uses a
[01:26:44.240 --> 01:26:50.080]   computer that way or nobody does that anymore. It's like that I have like a macro inside my head
[01:26:50.080 --> 01:26:55.040]   says, no, you're you I don't think the word nobody means what you think it means. I think you think
[01:26:55.040 --> 01:26:59.440]   it means I personally don't use it this way. And therefore, it's not important to me. And when it
[01:26:59.440 --> 01:27:04.720]   comes to something like a windowing manager, it doesn't it doesn't matter that if if it were true
[01:27:04.720 --> 01:27:09.280]   that 5%, not that anyone suggested that in this conversation. But like even if someone was saying
[01:27:09.280 --> 01:27:14.080]   even if we had numbers saying, Oh, well, only like 8% people you actually use spaces. That's great for
[01:27:14.080 --> 01:27:19.120]   that 8% let's keep it in there so that those 8% really have a have a have a method of working with
[01:27:19.120 --> 01:27:24.480]   their Mac that absolutely speaks to them and makes things easier for them. So it's in in lieu of a
[01:27:24.480 --> 01:27:30.800]   Linux like situation where I can basically install the windows manager that speaks to me. I'm glad
[01:27:30.800 --> 01:27:35.520]   that Apple is looking at alternative ways that not just simply saying, again, coming down from the
[01:27:35.520 --> 01:27:40.800]   mountain with these two tablets saying, but behold, the only thing greater than yourself, this new
[01:27:40.800 --> 01:27:44.400]   windowing manager that you're all going to be forced to use anymore. I think it's gonna I think
[01:27:44.400 --> 01:27:49.760]   it's gonna be wonderful if if Apple gives people those kind of options. I think stage manager is
[01:27:49.760 --> 01:27:57.040]   the answer to the question, what is Apple hiding? Okay, I'm just gonna say it. And if not, they ought
[01:27:57.040 --> 01:28:03.280]   to be. So do not take your iPhone or Apple Watch on a roller coaster apparently because 911 is
[01:28:03.280 --> 01:28:14.480]   gonna get called a whole spate of 911 calls from people writing roller coasters. According to the
[01:28:14.480 --> 01:28:24.080]   Wall Street Journal, it looks like you've been in a crash. No, I've just I've just been writing the
[01:28:24.080 --> 01:28:31.600]   mystic timber roller coaster. I think one one 911 system said we got six calls today.
[01:28:31.600 --> 01:28:42.480]   Six six calls today from the roller coaster. So yeah, the Warren County Communications Center
[01:28:42.480 --> 01:28:48.080]   provided me the recording of six iPhone crash detection calls from people at King Island,
[01:28:48.080 --> 01:28:53.040]   King's Island rides all received since the new iPhone 14 went on sale in September. So not all
[01:28:53.040 --> 01:28:59.360]   in one day, but still that, you know, that's a burden on the call detector. And the reason,
[01:28:59.360 --> 01:29:04.320]   of course, is if you notice it, you could stop it, but it's in your pocket and you're screaming
[01:29:04.320 --> 01:29:07.760]   and you got your hands in the air. It may call 911 for you.
[01:29:09.040 --> 01:29:12.960]   The I had there was someone on office hours we were talking about, I think this morning that they
[01:29:12.960 --> 01:29:17.680]   broke their ankle in a couple places and were so much pain that they didn't respond to the,
[01:29:17.680 --> 01:29:22.240]   you know, there's I think it was a biking accident, but but didn't respond to the their their watch.
[01:29:22.240 --> 01:29:27.200]   And someone came to pick them up. They were very glad that someone came. So so you know, I think
[01:29:27.200 --> 01:29:32.560]   there are and I should mention that there have been lives saved. Well, there was one crash in Texas
[01:29:32.560 --> 01:29:37.840]   where everybody died in the crash. Nobody could call emergency services, but it was called by the
[01:29:37.840 --> 01:29:43.680]   by the iPhone. So I mean, I don't know. So the, you know, I think that this stuff, you know,
[01:29:43.680 --> 01:29:47.200]   this is the teething pains. I mean, obviously they're going to realize that if you're at Kenny Wood,
[01:29:47.200 --> 01:29:51.680]   you probably aren't going to be in a crash or six flags or whatever. You're, you know, you're not
[01:29:51.680 --> 01:29:56.000]   going to, you're not here on a crash. You're on, you're on the, the racer or whatever, you know,
[01:29:56.000 --> 01:30:00.320]   or thunderbolt. And so what's thunderbolt would feel like you're in a crash? I grew up Pittsburgh.
[01:30:00.320 --> 01:30:04.320]   And so it feels like you're in a crash the whole time.
[01:30:04.320 --> 01:30:07.040]   When you crawl across your word, yeah, there's still
[01:30:07.040 --> 01:30:14.240]   extra fives. Can Apple fix this? Is there an update? Yeah. Yeah. I'm sure that they can fix it. I
[01:30:14.240 --> 01:30:19.440]   mean, this is and they can, I think that eventually they're going to start to realize like if you're
[01:30:19.440 --> 01:30:23.600]   bouncing up and down, you're bouncing up and down on a regular basis, you're probably on a
[01:30:23.600 --> 01:30:28.400]   transpoline. I can, I can probably go like that. Yeah. If you're bouncing on now, what happens if
[01:30:28.400 --> 01:30:33.120]   you bounce off the trampoline and hit your head, which happens to a lot of people. True. It would
[01:30:33.120 --> 01:30:36.400]   be nice to send someone. So it's a little, it gets complicated. I think that they're going to air
[01:30:36.400 --> 01:30:39.360]   on the side of, we're going to call the, we're going to call somebody because what you don't
[01:30:39.360 --> 01:30:44.560]   want is the article of, I had the watch and it didn't do anything and I, you know, that type of
[01:30:44.560 --> 01:30:48.880]   thing is less, less exciting. And so, so the, but I think that knowing that once you're in the
[01:30:48.880 --> 01:30:55.120]   perimeter of a, of a roller coaster area, you may not be in a car crash. You know, it might be.
[01:30:55.120 --> 01:30:59.280]   Yep. Oh, that's one way to do it. Yeah. Yeah. Location. Although at the same time,
[01:30:59.280 --> 01:31:03.840]   somebody falls off the roller coaster. Right. You want to respond. So it's not a crash, though.
[01:31:03.840 --> 01:31:08.720]   That's not a crash. Apparently the problem in the roller coasters is, is on some roller
[01:31:08.720 --> 01:31:13.360]   coasters. I don't know. I don't go on them. They have very sudden deceleration. They go from 40
[01:31:13.360 --> 01:31:19.280]   to miles an hour to zero in a second or two. I don't, and so that's, that's apparently where it's
[01:31:19.280 --> 01:31:23.840]   going off. They, they, and they should be able to fix it. During my briefing, I asked them like what
[01:31:23.840 --> 01:31:30.240]   the, what the difference was in implementation, say, between their crash protection, their crash
[01:31:30.240 --> 01:31:34.960]   detection and the Android crash detection has been around for a few years. And their answer was
[01:31:34.960 --> 01:31:38.880]   basically that we think that our sensors are a lot more finer tuned and that they can inform our
[01:31:38.880 --> 01:31:44.320]   algorithms, our machine learning model a lot better. So it seems as though, guess what? If you,
[01:31:44.320 --> 01:31:48.720]   guess what? If you work at Apple, you might just might be sent out for a week to provide roller
[01:31:48.720 --> 01:31:54.560]   coasters with a couple of special iPhones in your pockets. So lucky to collect nor data and train
[01:31:54.560 --> 01:31:57.440]   the new machine language model. So good, good luck to you. That's going to be awesome.
[01:31:57.440 --> 01:32:08.720]   Welcome back to the laptop. Apple is rebranding notebooks as laptops. Did you see this story?
[01:32:08.720 --> 01:32:13.040]   Yeah. That's, I remember when we went to notebooks.
[01:32:14.000 --> 01:32:20.880]   Yes. That was a, that was a big thing. Now Apple, this is from nine to five Mac today.
[01:32:20.880 --> 01:32:23.680]   If I could pull it up, I'm not, I'm not going to throw pulling it up.
[01:32:23.680 --> 01:32:29.840]   Apple is rebranding their, their stuff is laptops. Where is that on the website on the?
[01:32:29.840 --> 01:32:33.360]   Yeah. They, they, they, they, someone noticed that like they didn't, it wasn't an announcement
[01:32:33.360 --> 01:32:37.600]   or anything. This knows that all across the website, they're not what used to be referred to
[01:32:37.600 --> 01:32:43.120]   as notebooks are now laptops or the, they have a screenshot of which laptop is right for you.
[01:32:43.120 --> 01:32:46.560]   And here's the MacBook error, the MacBook Pro, the Mac, the other MacBook Pro.
[01:32:46.560 --> 01:32:51.520]   Here you go. So yeah, that's, that's, as soon as I saw that headline, I was thinking, yeah,
[01:32:51.520 --> 01:32:57.440]   that makes sense. A, because I tend to see laptop used more than notebook, even though I do think
[01:32:57.440 --> 01:33:02.400]   there's synonyms, but also that with the range of products that Apple comes out with, it's kind of
[01:33:02.400 --> 01:33:08.240]   important for them to really put a hard edge between this is a laptop. You should, you should
[01:33:08.240 --> 01:33:13.280]   anticipate a keyboard and a screen separated by a mechanical hinge. This is a notebook. There are
[01:33:13.280 --> 01:33:18.320]   all things that could be used as notebooks, and particularly with all the apps that we're making
[01:33:18.320 --> 01:33:23.920]   cross platform right now, but who knows it could, it could just be because they have some sort of a,
[01:33:23.920 --> 01:33:28.960]   Oh, okay. That's the change. So it used to say which, so they, they expressly changed notebook
[01:33:28.960 --> 01:33:34.160]   to laptop. That's really interesting. And they went from Mac notebook to which laptop. Well,
[01:33:34.160 --> 01:33:39.840]   obviously you're here for a Mac. So we don't need to say that. I think notebook was a rebranding attempt
[01:33:39.840 --> 01:33:45.280]   to emphasize how thin and light they were, right? Or not. I can't remember. I can't remember
[01:33:45.280 --> 01:33:49.920]   one that we've been able to. I feel like this is since the Mac portable that they went to the power
[01:33:49.920 --> 01:33:55.840]   book. It was a notebook. And they chose a metaphor that is not part of me thinks that this is a
[01:33:55.840 --> 01:34:00.720]   diabolical plan and they've got some naming thing in the works. But part of me thinks this is SEO.
[01:34:00.720 --> 01:34:05.680]   This is search engine optimization, where somebody came into a meeting and said, I know that for 25
[01:34:05.680 --> 01:34:10.240]   years, we've referred to all of our laptops as notebooks. However, I'm going to tell you,
[01:34:10.240 --> 01:34:15.760]   people search for notebook at a quarter of the time as they search for laptop and work,
[01:34:15.760 --> 01:34:21.280]   it's killing us not having laptop in there. We've got book in there, but we don't have lap or top.
[01:34:21.280 --> 01:34:26.640]   So let's throw them in there and we'll get more results and hooray. And like, because what was
[01:34:26.640 --> 01:34:32.480]   that meeting where they said, yes, let's do it. Sweep it all away. Notebooks out laptops in.
[01:34:32.480 --> 01:34:38.960]   It's got to be a reason. They put money and time into answering this question. This wasn't just a,
[01:34:38.960 --> 01:34:42.880]   yeah, actually, you know what, that kind of makes sense. Let's do that. It was great. You've got
[01:34:42.880 --> 01:34:50.400]   three months and $80,000 to study this idea. And there is a number somewhere in a document that
[01:34:50.400 --> 01:34:54.000]   hears how much money it's costing us by saying notebook is set a laptop.
[01:34:55.040 --> 01:35:00.640]   Dell calls them laptops. I feel like though, a lot of PC manufacturers adopted notebooks.
[01:35:00.640 --> 01:35:08.720]   But I guess they're laptops again. Maybe they didn't want to use the word lap. I don't know.
[01:35:08.720 --> 01:35:17.920]   Oh, I'm getting it. Are you in an accident? No, no, no. Is this show moving too fast for you,
[01:35:17.920 --> 01:35:24.160]   Andy? I got a Twitter message, it's a direct message from somebody and I'm trying to,
[01:35:24.160 --> 01:35:26.640]   someone I know I'm trying to figure out whether this is a joke or not.
[01:35:26.640 --> 01:35:31.120]   Okay, so you do the research. I'm not gonna, I'm gonna follow up on this.
[01:35:31.120 --> 01:35:35.280]   Maybe they got an invitation to an apple event. I don't know. What is apple hiding?
[01:35:35.280 --> 01:35:40.560]   It was a, I'll say that it's the reason why I have to figure out if this is a joke or not is because
[01:35:40.560 --> 01:35:48.720]   no piece says I know this on fact says Jason O'Grady. Okay, I'm gonna check check check.
[01:35:48.720 --> 01:35:52.000]   When you check it while I read this, I'll tell you a little story. I will tell you a little
[01:35:52.000 --> 01:35:56.240]   story. I will ask him for a citation on what he's saying.
[01:35:56.240 --> 01:36:00.800]   Good. This is called journalism. It's happening before your eyes. Ladies and gentlemen,
[01:36:00.800 --> 01:36:09.360]   or before your ears. About 1993 was Steve Wozniak was flying to Tokyo, had a little time on his
[01:36:09.360 --> 01:36:16.400]   hands. He said, I ran Mavis Beacon, teaches typing in the Vorak mode. I spent five hours learning
[01:36:16.400 --> 01:36:21.760]   the Vorak keyboard and never again looked at a QWERTY keyboard. That's all it took. My son had
[01:36:21.760 --> 01:36:26.800]   already switched over to successfully and learned to Vorak in a short time. I quickly got up to speed.
[01:36:26.800 --> 01:36:36.000]   He typed in QWERTY in about a week. Woz says, what I liked most about Devorak was the feeling of
[01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:42.880]   using less energy with your fingers. Since iPhones came, Woz says I had to resort to QWERTY,
[01:36:42.880 --> 01:36:47.680]   but it wasn't in my brain anymore. I'd been a very fast QWERTY type as to my whole life. Now it's gone.
[01:36:47.680 --> 01:36:55.280]   I have to look at the letters on my iPhone. Steve Jobs says, oh, I'm Steve Wozniak. Channeling,
[01:36:55.280 --> 01:37:02.320]   not Steve Jobs, says OMG. Thank you very much, Apple. The Devorak keyboard comes to the iPhone.
[01:37:02.320 --> 01:37:11.920]   I think he's the only person cheering this. I'm thinking, but anybody here type in Devorak mode?
[01:37:12.800 --> 01:37:18.640]   I'm actually a Devorak typist. No. I type in the ancient form of hunt and peck.
[01:37:18.640 --> 01:37:21.920]   Me too. Two fingers, baby. I like to call it the claw.
[01:37:21.920 --> 01:37:27.680]   But I'm tempted now. Maybe I should learn Vorak. I didn't realize the iPhone had to.
[01:37:27.680 --> 01:37:31.440]   I would have to. I have to do something completely different. The problem is I learned how to program
[01:37:31.440 --> 01:37:36.080]   before we had high school classes about it. The problem is the muscle number was so there and I
[01:37:36.080 --> 01:37:42.080]   could not go back. When I listen to my wife type it like 150 words a minute,
[01:37:42.080 --> 01:37:46.560]   like I go, I should really think about going back to learning how to do that. But I don't think
[01:37:46.560 --> 01:37:54.800]   all right. So that's a minor thing. And I think probably nobody cares. But the Devorak
[01:37:54.800 --> 01:37:59.840]   keyboard, which is not the Vorzak keyboard because that would let you compose symphonies.
[01:37:59.840 --> 01:38:01.920]   For the new world only. For the new world.
[01:38:05.920 --> 01:38:14.320]   Apple owns 40% of the fast growing pre-owned smartphone market. Isn't that interesting?
[01:38:14.320 --> 01:38:26.080]   This comes from CounterPoint Research. Big chunk compared to even Samsung, Huawei,
[01:38:26.080 --> 01:38:33.920]   Oppo, Vivo, and then all the rest. 40%. That I think says more about, if anything says more
[01:38:33.920 --> 01:38:39.280]   about the cost of Apple phones than anything else, but that they keep their value, I would guess
[01:38:39.280 --> 01:38:45.520]   quite well. I know probably most of my family, I mean, I think about it, is using hand-me-downs.
[01:38:45.520 --> 01:38:52.640]   Any word yet? Andy, not go from this giant scoop.
[01:38:52.640 --> 01:39:00.240]   Not a giant scoop. People will recognize his name, Jason O'Grady. He was one of the
[01:39:01.440 --> 01:39:05.280]   very, very good, very, very smart guy. He created the O'Grady's Power Page.
[01:39:05.280 --> 01:39:08.240]   The Power Page. Oh, I remember the O'Grady Power Page. Yeah.
[01:39:08.240 --> 01:39:15.840]   Hang on. Before I'm going to officially message him and say, "Is it okay if I repeat this on the
[01:39:15.840 --> 01:39:22.240]   show?" Okay, so go ahead. Message it. I mean, he's listening, so he's probably about to say yes or
[01:39:22.240 --> 01:39:27.200]   no. "Mr. O'Grady, may we use your name in vain?" And tear down this wall.
[01:39:29.120 --> 01:39:34.800]   Tear down. No, that's a different mister. Oh, sorry. Let's see. I think I'm done with stories
[01:39:34.800 --> 01:39:39.760]   here. So I'll tell you what, while you're working this story, I will give a plug for
[01:39:39.760 --> 01:39:45.360]   Club Twig, because it's become more and more important to us. Go for it, he says.
[01:39:45.360 --> 01:39:52.640]   Go for it. All right. What is the news? Okay, so he says that when it was changed to Notebook,
[01:39:52.640 --> 01:39:58.800]   it was done by legal because of the heat generated by the laptops. Apple did not want to endorse a
[01:39:58.800 --> 01:40:05.520]   piece of hardware that could burn your lap. He says, "Oh my God." He says he knows this on fact,
[01:40:05.520 --> 01:40:12.000]   not joking. I was told this by sources at the time, and he distinctly remembers this change
[01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:17.760]   being a technical writer. And his theory agrees with ours that it seems that the Apple changed it
[01:40:17.760 --> 01:40:23.440]   back to laptop now due to SEO reasons. But the original reason why they became Notebooks was
[01:40:23.440 --> 01:40:30.880]   because they did not want a really, really super hot Intel or power PC powered device they're
[01:40:30.880 --> 01:40:35.920]   making on people's lap. I can actually, that does sound credible because I remember,
[01:40:35.920 --> 01:40:44.000]   there's probably still a scar on the inside of my ankle. When I was sitting cross-legged on a sofa,
[01:40:44.000 --> 01:40:50.800]   there would be a section of that MacBook that would get so excretioningly hot that I would put
[01:40:50.800 --> 01:40:56.240]   like a towel underneath it to prevent myself from feeling getting burned. So he says he needs to
[01:40:56.240 --> 01:41:04.000]   get to a keyboard to be able to link to a source or something on this. But that makes a perfect
[01:41:04.000 --> 01:41:08.960]   sense. They didn't want to say lap because then if you got burned, they're liable. That makes perfect
[01:41:08.960 --> 01:41:14.000]   perfect sense. I guess this means there's another Apple Silicon success story, right? Yeah, another
[01:41:14.000 --> 01:41:17.600]   Apple Silicon success story. Put it in your lap with us again. Put it in your laptop.
[01:41:17.600 --> 01:41:21.600]   Bottom temps were over 120 degrees on Intel. Thank you. Thanks, Jason.
[01:41:21.600 --> 01:41:26.480]   And by the way, this is why I say there's some names where like that catches my, when I get a
[01:41:26.480 --> 01:41:32.640]   direct message from someone like Jason that gets my immediate attention because like he probably
[01:41:32.640 --> 01:41:37.680]   knows, he probably knows what he's doing and he probably has had this from experience. I just had
[01:41:37.680 --> 01:41:42.080]   I'm not going to repeat that before we're asking some follow up questions.
[01:41:43.280 --> 01:41:51.440]   So by the way, oh, Grady's Power Page lives still at powerpage.org. So Jason, we got to get Jason
[01:41:51.440 --> 01:41:58.000]   O'Grady on the show sometime. That's awesome. It says he's now a Googler. So I guess that's
[01:41:58.000 --> 01:42:04.800]   interesting. So a power page, which was the according to him, the second Mac blog started in 1995.
[01:42:04.800 --> 01:42:10.000]   Yes. No, this is this is probably like the first one of the first URLs you probably, one of the
[01:42:10.000 --> 01:42:16.240]   reasons why you installed Mosaic probably was because, oh, I've heard I Mac week is once again
[01:42:16.240 --> 01:42:20.960]   quoting this power page thing. Oh, maybe I should maybe I should get a slip account and
[01:42:20.960 --> 01:42:26.160]   figure out how to use this internet thing. I'm going to add the power page. Let's see if they
[01:42:26.160 --> 01:42:32.080]   have an RSS feed because I'm going to add them to my assuming news RSS feeds because
[01:42:33.680 --> 01:42:39.520]   I want to be following everything. Jason writes and we should. Yes. I am you're now in my your
[01:42:39.520 --> 01:42:44.880]   RSS feed in my RSS feed. Thank you, Jason. Glad to know you listen. And what a great that's a
[01:42:44.880 --> 01:42:51.440]   great memory. We all have the we all have a lot of these stories where it's things that we have
[01:42:51.440 --> 01:42:56.560]   been told that are just been filed away and it came from a really, really good source, but
[01:42:56.560 --> 01:43:00.400]   we never wrote about or we never Oh, can we can you commit this to an interview so we can actually
[01:43:00.400 --> 01:43:05.680]   like publish this, but then that just never happened. So but it becomes part of the cultural
[01:43:05.680 --> 01:43:14.240]   history that needs to be passed along. Yep. Yep. Awesome. I was starting to give a plug to our
[01:43:14.240 --> 01:43:19.360]   very special club Twitter club that wants you as a member. We would love to have you as a member
[01:43:19.360 --> 01:43:24.480]   of club twit. It is one of the ways we support ourselves and it's becoming more and more important,
[01:43:24.480 --> 01:43:28.960]   especially as we head into I hate to say at a recession and advertisers are getting a little
[01:43:28.960 --> 01:43:34.880]   skittish about advertising on podcasts. We need to make up that revenue to keep the lights on,
[01:43:34.880 --> 01:43:39.040]   to keep the shows flowing. And the best way to do it, I think is going right to our listeners,
[01:43:39.040 --> 01:43:44.960]   $7 a month. That's all it costs for ad free versions of all of our shows. You also get access
[01:43:44.960 --> 01:43:51.760]   to the discord where which is wonderful, where you'll see Jason Snell typing in Devorac or something.
[01:43:51.760 --> 01:43:56.800]   Yeah, nonsense. Is that Oh, I thought I was Latin for a bit it or maybe well,
[01:43:56.800 --> 01:44:01.760]   I don't know. You all the discord is a place to hang not just during the shows, but all sorts
[01:44:01.760 --> 01:44:06.960]   of conversations about every possible topic plus a twit plus feed where shows that we have not yet
[01:44:06.960 --> 01:44:12.320]   developed sufficiently to put out into the public can be heard like our hands on Mac show with
[01:44:12.320 --> 01:44:18.560]   Michael Sargent, which is really excellent. Hands on windows with Paul Therat. If you're a
[01:44:18.560 --> 01:44:22.720]   windows lover, you're going to love this one. The untitled Linux show Little Near and Dear to My
[01:44:22.720 --> 01:44:27.520]   Heart with Jonathan Bennett, Stacy's book club, lots of stuff going on. That's where we launched
[01:44:27.520 --> 01:44:33.920]   this, so to speak, this week in space and did become public. So the club members subsidize these
[01:44:33.920 --> 01:44:37.760]   new shows. And so we really appreciate it. For those of you who are club members, thank you.
[01:44:37.760 --> 01:44:44.800]   And for those of you who aren't, we are special. Please go to twit.tv/clubtwit.
[01:44:44.800 --> 01:44:50.880]   I will be very, very grateful. It really has made a big difference for us and going forward.
[01:44:50.880 --> 01:44:56.560]   I mean, if to be frank, if you see a future for twit three, four, five years from now,
[01:44:56.560 --> 01:45:02.960]   I think it will be because club twit has kept us going. So it's important. Thank you.
[01:45:02.960 --> 01:45:12.000]   Let us get to our picks of the week. Let me start with you, Jason Snell.
[01:45:12.000 --> 01:45:18.960]   All right. I am going to go a little bit off the beaten path and I'm going to pick an e-reader
[01:45:18.960 --> 01:45:23.920]   because I do love reading and I love reading books in electronic format. And I'm not going to pick a
[01:45:23.920 --> 01:45:30.720]   Kindle. What? I'm going to pick the code. The hell you say it counts like a kendo. I bought a
[01:45:30.720 --> 01:45:36.960]   kobo because you get library books on it, right? Yeah, you can get library books on the Kindle,
[01:45:36.960 --> 01:45:41.680]   too, but the kobo is directly integrated with Overdrive. So you can even search for your library
[01:45:41.680 --> 01:45:45.280]   books on there. You can return them right on there. You don't have to go through a second,
[01:45:45.280 --> 01:45:50.960]   a second app or a second process like you do. Really like that. Yeah. This is the leaper two.
[01:45:50.960 --> 01:45:57.920]   It's $180 and that I'll point out that's $100 less than the cheapest Kindle that has physical
[01:45:57.920 --> 01:46:02.640]   page turn buttons. This has physical buttons. You click to turn the page, which for me is how I
[01:46:02.640 --> 01:46:07.840]   prefer to read a book instead of every page moving my finger over and covering the text that I'm
[01:46:07.840 --> 01:46:11.440]   reading and tapping and then moving it off. I like just resting my finger on the button.
[01:46:11.440 --> 01:46:15.200]   And then you press next. I like that too. And you go to the next page. It's real good. And it's
[01:46:15.200 --> 01:46:19.520]   why Amazon thinks this is a premium feature I don't know, but the leaper has it for $100 less.
[01:46:19.520 --> 01:46:26.320]   And that's $100 less than the Kindle Oasis with ads. There are no ads on the kobo. So it's $120
[01:46:26.320 --> 01:46:31.680]   less than the one without ads. And you can read it underwater, which is awesome. It's all, you know,
[01:46:31.680 --> 01:46:36.640]   it's all waterproof. It's not a vacation. That's a good idea. It is. It's great for
[01:46:36.640 --> 01:46:42.960]   for a bathroom beach. And also one of the things, I mean, look, it's $100 less and it's all plastic.
[01:46:42.960 --> 01:46:47.920]   It doesn't have like the metal back, like the Kindle Oasis or any of that. But it's a good,
[01:46:47.920 --> 01:46:54.480]   solid e-reader. And it's got, you know, it's waterproof backlighting. It's got a really nice
[01:46:54.480 --> 01:46:58.640]   little adjustable backlight where if you run your finger up the corner of the screen,
[01:46:58.640 --> 01:47:02.480]   the backlighting goes up or down, you don't have to go to an interface to do it to, you know,
[01:47:02.480 --> 01:47:06.720]   again, try to minimize the amount of time you're using a computer interface when you're reading a
[01:47:06.720 --> 01:47:11.840]   book. I like it a lot. I think the software is superior to Amazon software. Not as much as it
[01:47:11.840 --> 01:47:17.360]   was a year ago. You have to buy books from the kobo store. You, yes. Well, okay. Yes, you do.
[01:47:17.360 --> 01:47:21.440]   The kobo store has all the same books that the Kindle store has for basically the same price.
[01:47:21.440 --> 01:47:25.120]   Okay. And I know when I talk to people about this and they're like, yes, but I bought some
[01:47:25.120 --> 01:47:30.000]   Kindle books. Well, buying a kobo doesn't mean you have to throw away your old Kindle. You could
[01:47:30.000 --> 01:47:34.080]   keep it around. And also there's software for that. I'll just mention, I know it's been mentioned on
[01:47:34.080 --> 01:47:41.600]   the show in the distant past, but caliber is a free open source project that runs on the Mac
[01:47:41.600 --> 01:47:48.160]   and many other platforms that will load things onto a kobo just as easily as a Kindle. If you've
[01:47:48.160 --> 01:47:52.800]   got e-pubs, it'll load them right on. There's a special extended kobo version of e-pub that
[01:47:52.800 --> 01:47:57.760]   makes them all pretty on the kobo. And that's there's a plug-in that's built into caliber for that.
[01:47:57.760 --> 01:48:02.480]   And if you've got old Kindle books that have DRM on them, you can get them. You can use the
[01:48:02.480 --> 01:48:08.000]   DDRM tools, which are widely available on the web as a plug-in for caliber from Apprentice
[01:48:08.000 --> 01:48:15.440]   Elf. That's his name. And those will pull the Kindle DRM off. And then you can just put them on
[01:48:15.440 --> 01:48:20.480]   your kobo that way if you really want to do that. But in terms of library books and new books,
[01:48:20.480 --> 01:48:25.920]   I've just been using the kobo store and overdrive and it's been great. And I think it's the best deal
[01:48:25.920 --> 01:48:30.720]   going in ebook readers right now, especially if you want those physical page turn buttons.
[01:48:30.720 --> 01:48:36.080]   I bought it because of the library. If I went out and got a library card and everything.
[01:48:36.080 --> 01:48:40.400]   Because I think that's what a great way, seamless way to borrow library books.
[01:48:40.400 --> 01:48:45.760]   And then I just didn't use it that much. So I said it to Stacey. And I don't think Stacey likes
[01:48:45.760 --> 01:48:51.280]   it because she never talks about it. So I might ask her back, ask her for it back. Because
[01:48:51.280 --> 01:48:56.240]   waterproof is great. It's 300 PPI, which is just as good as the Kindle. It's got backlight.
[01:48:56.240 --> 01:49:01.520]   Seven inches, 32 gigs, which is a lot for any way.
[01:49:01.520 --> 01:49:06.560]   It's for books. It is. Yeah. I mean, it's not for comics or PDFs or anything like that. It's
[01:49:06.560 --> 01:49:10.720]   the smaller one. But for novels, and I know there are a lot of people who watch and listen to this
[01:49:10.720 --> 01:49:14.400]   show who probably say, "Well, why wouldn't you just use your iPad?" And the answer is, I really
[01:49:14.400 --> 01:49:19.680]   like not being distracted when I'm reading a novel, especially. I like not being distracted.
[01:49:19.680 --> 01:49:24.880]   And the Kindle and the Kobo, for better or worse, they don't have an App Store, essentially. So
[01:49:24.880 --> 01:49:29.200]   they just do what they do, which is you're reading text on a page. Yeah, it's black and white or
[01:49:29.200 --> 01:49:33.680]   grayscale. In this case, it doesn't matter. It's just text on a page. The contrast is pretty good.
[01:49:33.680 --> 01:49:40.080]   Better. Some would argue. Yeah. And I love it. So this is how I read. And I read 50 or 60 books a
[01:49:40.080 --> 01:49:46.160]   year. And this is how I do it. Wow. That's great. I got to jump on and say, I agree that 100%
[01:49:47.120 --> 01:49:53.920]   that I have, like most of us on this conversation, I have a bunch of iPads. So I can have beautiful
[01:49:53.920 --> 01:50:00.640]   book reading experiences. But I still have like a eight year old Kindle that I sometimes take
[01:50:00.640 --> 01:50:05.280]   with me because number one, I don't run down the battery the way I went on the iPad, which is
[01:50:05.280 --> 01:50:09.760]   something that I need to have that battery for actual work later in the day. But also,
[01:50:09.760 --> 01:50:17.040]   there are times where I'm going into, I'm in New York for a few days. I know that all I'm going
[01:50:17.040 --> 01:50:21.600]   to do is I'm going to be riding in and out of town to go hang out with people and have events. I don't
[01:50:21.600 --> 01:50:26.960]   need to have an iPad with me, but I do need something to read on the way in and out of town.
[01:50:26.960 --> 01:50:31.280]   And having the separate little device with a 30 hour battery in it and a much better experience,
[01:50:31.280 --> 01:50:36.400]   which if it gets stolen out of my hands on the subway, as as someone rushes out, is not going
[01:50:36.400 --> 01:50:43.520]   to really kill me to lose like a $180 thing versus my $1,000 iPad. So yeah, I kind of rediscovered it.
[01:50:43.520 --> 01:50:48.240]   I had I stopped using it like three years ago, but then when I was cleaning the office like about
[01:50:48.240 --> 01:50:51.440]   two or three months ago, I rediscovered and said, why did I stop using this? I have to say,
[01:50:51.440 --> 01:50:56.720]   battery life, I have left more than one Kindle in the back of a airplane seat. However,
[01:50:56.720 --> 01:51:02.480]   oh yeah, yeah. Same. Same. But they the end and and is exactly right. The battery life thing is
[01:51:02.480 --> 01:51:07.520]   such a great thing that you can turn this thing up, wait, turn off the Wi-Fi and it will last for
[01:51:07.520 --> 01:51:12.960]   weeks. Yeah. And so anyway, yeah, if you if you've never done it, I would say give the
[01:51:12.960 --> 01:51:17.360]   Kobo some consideration or if you've gotten the older one, the quality of the screens has gotten
[01:51:17.360 --> 01:51:21.760]   a lot better and the backlighting it's sidelighting, but you know what I mean? It it lights itself
[01:51:21.760 --> 01:51:26.080]   now the old ones didn't do that yet. I used to have to clip a book light onto my Kindle.
[01:51:26.080 --> 01:51:31.920]   How does it all use to to? Yeah, but they sold all that stuff in Amazon. You know, Amazon may
[01:51:31.920 --> 01:51:35.760]   come out with some new Kindle hardware that beats this and they've made strides on the
[01:51:35.760 --> 01:51:41.280]   software side. Their software is not as far behind Kobo as it used to be, but I have I have the
[01:51:41.280 --> 01:51:46.800]   Kindle Oasis that costs $120 more than this and I don't use it. I use it instead. Yeah.
[01:51:46.800 --> 01:51:52.800]   I might have to buy another one. You're a good salesman. Thank you, Jason.
[01:51:52.800 --> 01:51:57.920]   The only the other thing that's sent me off a little bit is Rakuten bought them and that made me
[01:51:57.920 --> 01:52:03.440]   a little nervous too. Yeah, and I think they've spun them off now. Maybe they spun over.
[01:52:03.440 --> 01:52:09.360]   So this is Rakuten. Yeah, they're Rakuten and that's that's right. And they but they did spin
[01:52:09.360 --> 01:52:13.120]   off overdrive, but the connection is still there with overdrive and Kobo readers. The other weird
[01:52:13.120 --> 01:52:18.160]   thing is their deal with with Walmart. If that if you're somebody who doesn't like Walmart,
[01:52:18.160 --> 01:52:22.720]   it's kind of funny that when you log in to Kobo, they're like, would you like to log in with Walmart?
[01:52:22.720 --> 01:52:28.480]   You're like, no, I don't want to do that. I want to log in with my my Rakuten Kobo ID instead, but
[01:52:28.480 --> 01:52:32.400]   it's a good like and I'm glad that they still exist, right? Because this is one of those categories
[01:52:32.400 --> 01:52:36.400]   that Amazon could have just swallowed whole and everything's a Kindle and they have no competition
[01:52:36.400 --> 01:52:41.040]   at all. And what I learned when I tried the Kobo out is that they do have competition
[01:52:41.040 --> 01:52:45.920]   and Amazon really let their software get get real bad and they were really embarrassed by the
[01:52:45.920 --> 01:52:51.280]   Kobo software. They are better now. The Amazon really did do a good update on the Kindle software
[01:52:51.280 --> 01:52:58.560]   last year. Competition's good. It is good. Andy and I go pick of the week. Pick of the week is an
[01:52:58.560 --> 01:53:04.880]   unusually good deal on a very good pair of in-in monitors. They're not earbuds. They're in-in
[01:53:04.880 --> 01:53:13.840]   monitors. The Edomonic Research ER3-3SE studio edition earphones, they're available most places
[01:53:13.840 --> 01:53:20.400]   for $150. You can get them cheap for like $90 to $100. But Adorama is having on like a one day or
[01:53:20.400 --> 01:53:26.800]   two day sale at 66% off for just $50. Wow. That's a good price. These are great headphones. They
[01:53:26.800 --> 01:53:30.880]   sound very, very, very, very special. Especially if like I like the style of headphones where
[01:53:30.880 --> 01:53:38.080]   now as you can see by the by the ear tips those those like airplug type type ear tips. These
[01:53:38.080 --> 01:53:44.320]   absolutely seal the world away from your from your from your entire head. Which means that they're
[01:53:44.320 --> 01:53:48.480]   really really bad. If you're on a bicycle, you don't want to be wearing this while you're on
[01:53:48.480 --> 01:53:54.320]   a street where there is traffic. But it's like it's the sort of the sort of design where noise
[01:53:54.320 --> 01:53:58.880]   cancellation almost doesn't enter in wood because noise is just not going to get into it. And they're
[01:53:58.880 --> 01:54:04.640]   very, very high quality audio as well. I don't I've never had this pair this this model of Edomonic
[01:54:04.640 --> 01:54:10.720]   Research earphones. But I have had other Edomonic Research airbuds and boy they are wired by the
[01:54:10.720 --> 01:54:16.800]   way. They are really, really good high quality stuff. And for 49 bucks, I almost I almost just went
[01:54:16.800 --> 01:54:21.920]   ahead and bought a pair. And I got as far as the great complete purchase button filling out
[01:54:21.920 --> 01:54:27.520]   everything before I realized that Andy, you you have a pair of really good like any like the sort
[01:54:27.520 --> 01:54:33.200]   of like in ear wired headphones. In addition to two pairs of wireless earbuds and two pairs of
[01:54:33.200 --> 01:54:38.160]   really good like over the head headphones you like, it's is a phenomenal deal. But you and I have
[01:54:38.160 --> 01:54:42.000]   said, okay, you're right, dad. I'm sorry. Thank you. Thank you for being the voice in my head. That's
[01:54:42.000 --> 01:54:48.720]   that recipe from spending money stupidly. But for anybody who does not have earphones like this,
[01:54:48.720 --> 01:54:53.920]   really, really good deal. It's only we're recording on Tuesday the 11th. I think it's a two day sale
[01:54:53.920 --> 01:55:00.960]   today and tomorrow. But as of like an hour before the show recorded, they still had plenty. And I
[01:55:00.960 --> 01:55:04.960]   was able to very nearly complete an order. So you should be able to get in on it. These are,
[01:55:04.960 --> 01:55:10.480]   you know, Edomonic makes a variety of headphones, some lower end. But these are their high end,
[01:55:10.480 --> 01:55:18.640]   high quality, the ER three SEs are very, very high quality. And as you point out, normally 150 bucks,
[01:55:18.640 --> 01:55:24.720]   so getting them for 50 is quite a deal. Yeah, even on Amazon, the cheapest prices 92. And that's not
[01:55:24.720 --> 01:55:28.400]   available anywhere. I have a grandma has them 50 bucks. This is a genuine deal. Yeah.
[01:55:28.400 --> 01:55:33.520]   Yeah, I remember actually crying when I got an airplane and realized I'd forgotten my
[01:55:33.520 --> 01:55:39.600]   edomotics, I'm just gonna have to listen to a baby and people and all that stuff. Oh, it's not a good
[01:55:39.600 --> 01:55:46.640]   experience. It's nice to have them. Thank you, Andy. And now to Alex Lindsay for his pick of the week.
[01:55:46.640 --> 01:55:53.200]   So a couple of weeks ago, I talked about zoom ISO and today we're going to see the next
[01:55:53.200 --> 01:55:57.600]   piece of that, which is called Izzy cast. This is not from zoom. This is from a company called
[01:55:57.600 --> 01:56:02.960]   Trichotronics. And they make Isadora, which I've talked about in the past. Oh, yeah. So that is
[01:56:02.960 --> 01:56:08.320]   a door is basically a low code programming environment that lets you very used in a lot of theater. So
[01:56:08.320 --> 01:56:11.680]   I want to have all the lights do this and I want to have this and I want to respond possibly to
[01:56:11.680 --> 01:56:15.840]   motion capture and I want to have all these other bits and pieces that are all tied together. So
[01:56:15.840 --> 01:56:20.400]   you can build these interactive events for theater and more and more of us have been starting to use
[01:56:20.400 --> 01:56:26.640]   as Adora. In fact, office hours runs on Isadora. Like it's just the whole core of it is all running
[01:56:26.640 --> 01:56:33.200]   there and making zoom calls, but is Adora is. Well, so yeah, we made zoom calls. We use zoom ISO
[01:56:33.200 --> 01:56:38.960]   to go out of out of zoom and then put it into our switcher and then we have Isadora running
[01:56:38.960 --> 01:56:42.800]   everything. So Isadora is running the graphics. It's running the switcher. It's running all those
[01:56:42.800 --> 01:56:46.880]   other bits and pieces. And so so it makes sense that what they're doing now is going to what Izzy
[01:56:46.880 --> 01:56:53.600]   cast. Now what this does is it sits on top of the zoom SDK. So this allows them zoom is now making
[01:56:53.600 --> 01:56:58.640]   it available where you people can just build whatever they want on top of zoom. So they're not
[01:56:58.640 --> 01:57:02.400]   you're not using the zoom interface. You're not logging into zoom. You're not doing anything else.
[01:57:02.400 --> 01:57:07.840]   It's just using the video architecture that zoom's built. And so what Izzy cast is doing here is
[01:57:07.840 --> 01:57:14.320]   passing audio, video and data back and forth between two locations that are hundreds of miles
[01:57:14.320 --> 01:57:19.520]   apart, but they could be anywhere in the world. But again, it's still using zoom to transport it,
[01:57:19.520 --> 01:57:23.840]   which means that you don't if you're developing this yourself, you would have to deal with firewalls
[01:57:23.840 --> 01:57:27.840]   and and all the infrastructure and updates and all those other things. And what they're doing is
[01:57:27.840 --> 01:57:35.360]   taking what they do well, which is this this larger low code interface and just adding some nodes
[01:57:35.360 --> 01:57:39.440]   that are like, I want to go get video. I want to go get data, you know, or I want to send data or
[01:57:39.440 --> 01:57:43.600]   send video. And that's all they all you have to add are these little nodes that then can be part
[01:57:43.600 --> 01:57:50.720]   of the larger interface. And so what they what you saw in that video is there's just a simple
[01:57:50.720 --> 01:57:56.160]   something someone opens and now they're able to send video, send audio, even send data, you know,
[01:57:56.160 --> 01:58:01.760]   back across to back to Isadora, which then allows it to do all the other things that Isadora does
[01:58:01.760 --> 01:58:09.280]   already. And so the real advantage there is that is that you can now very easily build your own
[01:58:09.280 --> 01:58:13.920]   solution. So if you don't like the way zoom works, like this is something that eventually some
[01:58:13.920 --> 01:58:18.480]   somewhere in the future, you could have Twitch just send out a little little something for
[01:58:18.480 --> 01:58:22.800]   someone to open, they open it up and it just grabs video and audio and and you can even have it
[01:58:22.800 --> 01:58:26.480]   have an interface where you could send back notes to us or all kinds of other things.
[01:58:26.480 --> 01:58:31.040]   You don't have to figure out how to make that work in zoom. It just it just works on either end.
[01:58:31.040 --> 01:58:37.440]   And so it's pretty, I mean, we're starting to really see the idea of interactive video start to
[01:58:37.440 --> 01:58:42.080]   become much and much much more accessible. And by having it in a low code environment, I mean,
[01:58:42.080 --> 01:58:46.960]   you can think about things and just draw nodes as opposed to trying to write, you know,
[01:58:46.960 --> 01:58:52.320]   swift or objective see or anything else to make this actually work. So it's a really interesting
[01:58:52.800 --> 01:58:57.200]   and we're going to be playing with it a lot. It's not released yet. So this is just a kind of a
[01:58:57.200 --> 01:59:02.240]   preview of it, but we're really excited about it. And again, it's partially because we already use
[01:59:02.240 --> 01:59:08.080]   the zoom ISO architecture to get all of our video in and out of out of stuff. It's it's a pretty
[01:59:08.080 --> 01:59:12.640]   pretty interesting technology coming out is now where do I go to get his adora?
[01:59:12.640 --> 01:59:16.160]   Troika Tronics, troika tronics is the
[01:59:16.160 --> 01:59:21.760]   katronics name. Yeah. But this is a beta. This is not yet available. Easy. It's in beta. Yeah,
[01:59:21.760 --> 01:59:26.880]   you'll probably see more of it or probably get released in as beta in November and probably won't
[01:59:26.880 --> 01:59:31.040]   be until early next year. But it's something that if you're doing video production, if you're
[01:59:31.040 --> 01:59:35.280]   especially at a broadcast level, this is something you want to start paying attention to. And right
[01:59:35.280 --> 01:59:39.520]   now, literally, there's a couple movies. So there's an hour where we talk to Mark
[01:59:40.160 --> 01:59:46.240]   Kanniglio, who is the founder of troika tronics, as well as Andy Carlucchio from zoom about what
[01:59:46.240 --> 01:59:50.080]   the development is. We did that last Friday. So you can go look at that video and watch an hour
[01:59:50.080 --> 01:59:54.320]   of us talking about it. But I got I got a bunch of pings on a couple social networks after they saw
[01:59:54.320 --> 01:59:59.520]   it just from broadcasters that are just like, Oh, okay, now I'm thinking about what I can do with
[01:59:59.520 --> 02:00:04.480]   this. And you know, and the cool thing is, is that with this SDK, you know, the the
[02:00:04.480 --> 02:00:09.200]   Izzy cast is going to make it a lot easier to integrate it with with is adora. But anybody
[02:00:09.200 --> 02:00:13.520]   could use the SDK. So you know, probably next year, we're going to see stuff, you know, it could
[02:00:13.520 --> 02:00:18.320]   be incorporated into memo live or be mixed or e cam or, you know, like a lot of those things,
[02:00:18.320 --> 02:00:22.480]   because right now everybody's been rolling their own and it's been a kind of a disaster, you know,
[02:00:22.480 --> 02:00:28.720]   and so this is making a lot easier to make that actually work. So anyway, so that's it's it's a
[02:00:28.720 --> 02:00:34.880]   pretty it's pretty slick system. And it really shows the possibility of kind of building your
[02:00:34.880 --> 02:00:39.840]   own interface and your own back and forth. And again, I think that Twit may end up using,
[02:00:39.840 --> 02:00:45.440]   you know, eventually might make sense to use either zoom ISO or or is it or this solution to
[02:00:45.440 --> 02:00:51.760]   totally own the connection between us on the edge and the studio.
[02:00:51.760 --> 02:00:56.640]   I obviously would love to do that if I could understand a word you're saying, but if
[02:00:56.640 --> 02:01:04.560]   some somebody was just right. I mean, right now, right now, the big thing is, is that you're
[02:01:05.120 --> 02:01:12.080]   you know, right up until recently, we were basically getting on zoom and then screen scraping zoom
[02:01:12.080 --> 02:01:16.160]   into a, you know, from a zoom room or whatever onto, you know, into our systems and then we can
[02:01:16.160 --> 02:01:21.280]   edit between people and everything else. And now I need to solve really is a way to
[02:01:21.280 --> 02:01:28.640]   have a show and then have people call into the show and have a lobby or something. You do this on
[02:01:28.640 --> 02:01:32.560]   office. I did all the time. And so they're sitting in a lobby and then they're invited up on a
[02:01:32.560 --> 02:01:37.840]   stage. But I want to be able to do that with minimal personnel. Like I'd be right, no, I'd like to be
[02:01:37.840 --> 02:01:41.200]   able to say, okay, let's take this person and put bring him up onto the stage. We could do that.
[02:01:41.200 --> 02:01:44.400]   And that's right now you can only do about 40 people at a time.
[02:01:44.400 --> 02:01:49.840]   Yeah, and it's it's not pretty easy to do that. And it's something that you can literally now,
[02:01:49.840 --> 02:01:53.680]   that could be something that if you start want to start using breakout rooms and putting people
[02:01:53.680 --> 02:01:58.320]   into prep and everything else, then then your then zoom ISO is probably the thing you want to do
[02:01:58.320 --> 02:02:02.080]   because you can have zoom ISO sitting there and just go hit a stream. I don't want to have a call
[02:02:02.080 --> 02:02:07.920]   screen here. I want to kind of have it so that you I can give out a number that you can call in
[02:02:07.920 --> 02:02:13.040]   and you be part of a room prep, preferably one of the other thing I realized is the biggest problem
[02:02:13.040 --> 02:02:18.640]   we have when we try to take calls and discord is people don't have the setup. I want to do it from
[02:02:18.640 --> 02:02:23.760]   a phone and just say, here's a here's a wouldn't be necessarily a number but a link that you do on
[02:02:23.760 --> 02:02:27.840]   your phone because you've got a camera and a microphone that worked pretty darn well. And you
[02:02:27.840 --> 02:02:33.440]   could actually participate on the phone. So I wanted to have that so they can call in from their phone
[02:02:33.440 --> 02:02:38.400]   somewhere and then we can put them on the air to take questions and comments and things like that.
[02:02:38.400 --> 02:02:41.120]   We've been doing it with discord. It doesn't work that well. So I need some.
[02:02:41.120 --> 02:02:46.400]   No, you could literally have a touch screen where you just see them coming in on their phone and
[02:02:46.400 --> 02:02:50.160]   just tap on it. I want that person and then it would just it would bring that person right into the
[02:02:50.160 --> 02:02:54.000]   show. And do I need is Adora to do that or can I do that just? You could do that with zoom. You
[02:02:54.000 --> 02:02:58.240]   could do that with my so. Yeah, absolutely. But for those of us who are building the
[02:02:58.240 --> 02:03:03.680]   higher use what we have to do, Alex, and that's all. Yeah. That's all. That's all it is. So it's
[02:03:03.680 --> 02:03:10.880]   it's a I think that it's a yeah. I don't need to be hired, but I can help. So here's another
[02:03:10.880 --> 02:03:16.080]   entreaty to join club twit because we probably can afford it. But with your with your help.
[02:03:16.080 --> 02:03:22.560]   Exactly. We can we can we can book one hour in which we get lots of questions in.
[02:03:22.560 --> 02:03:26.640]   Well, I would like to do a show kind of like the ratio where we take questions.
[02:03:26.640 --> 02:03:32.160]   Yeah. We're going to need to do it because I don't think we can I think we need the
[02:03:32.160 --> 02:03:36.960]   infrastructure to make that work. Finally, eight hundred and thirty eight episodes later
[02:03:36.960 --> 02:03:45.040]   the plan to get Alex involved in production. Oh, he's been involved in the past. It was a long
[02:03:45.040 --> 02:03:50.960]   it was a long seduction, but the perfume of the port. I think it's something Alex for 17 years.
[02:03:50.960 --> 02:03:56.960]   Believe me from day one, you know, Alex has been a great. I mean, I am not I am not kidding. I've
[02:03:56.960 --> 02:04:01.920]   been a great resource for all this. A lot of times what Alex does is the high price spread.
[02:04:01.920 --> 02:04:05.840]   I can't afford, but this is not I don't think that I don't think I think you'll find. We'll
[02:04:05.840 --> 02:04:09.680]   we'll figure out how to use it. I don't think it would cost that much. Yeah, could be could
[02:04:09.680 --> 02:04:14.000]   be my specific expensive. Everybody wonders why we step on each other, but we're on separate zoom
[02:04:14.000 --> 02:04:18.640]   calls. Yeah. Like two seconds off from each other. Yeah. We're all in the same call, but the set
[02:04:18.640 --> 02:04:23.120]   but we had Iso's, which is why we do it on separate machines right now that you know,
[02:04:23.120 --> 02:04:28.800]   we've done it that way since Colleen built Skype a source, right, right, which was four Mac
[02:04:28.800 --> 02:04:34.960]   Minis with Skype running individually just so we'd have ISO. But now if zoom will let us do Iso's,
[02:04:34.960 --> 02:04:39.920]   then that solves the whole problem. Well, and it with with Isadora, you could literally have heads
[02:04:39.920 --> 02:04:44.320]   up with Isadora and Izzy cash. You can have heads up displays where you're typing in like,
[02:04:44.320 --> 02:04:48.080]   hey, you're something's over your shoulder. I need you to turn your whatever down and all that stuff
[02:04:48.080 --> 02:04:53.760]   could be just showing up for us as a like a literally composited return from you as well.
[02:04:53.760 --> 02:04:58.480]   And but with with zoom Iso, you could definitely just be grabbing all the things that you're talking
[02:04:58.480 --> 02:05:02.480]   about. And it's not particularly inexpensive thing to do. So we'll talk more about it,
[02:05:02.480 --> 02:05:07.280]   but I think that it's a the other thing that that we're finding is that better color,
[02:05:07.280 --> 02:05:13.440]   you know, better frame rate. So coming out of the STI cards, because we're just we're literally
[02:05:13.440 --> 02:05:18.560]   just pushing from zoom Iso and what we will be doing with Izzy cast is pushing straight from the
[02:05:18.560 --> 02:05:23.200]   from the video coming into the computer straight to the to the deck link cards.
[02:05:23.200 --> 02:05:28.960]   So it's it's not screen scraping, which you lose some frame rate and quality on the way through.
[02:05:28.960 --> 02:05:32.720]   So John, I think you understand what he's saying. I hope that God somebody does.
[02:05:32.720 --> 02:05:34.640]   And we'll talk.
[02:05:34.640 --> 02:05:35.920]   Well, your people talk to my people.
[02:05:38.960 --> 02:05:44.960]   This is what you get when you go to 090.media you get Alex Lindsey and his incredible expertise.
[02:05:44.960 --> 02:05:50.720]   That's his day job. But but in the early morning hours, you'll find him at office hours.
[02:05:50.720 --> 02:05:55.200]   Dot global talking about all kinds of fantastic stuff.
[02:05:55.200 --> 02:06:01.760]   Just all the things Alex is kind of interested in, but it's gotten way bigger than me.
[02:06:01.760 --> 02:06:06.160]   Yeah, like I don't even manage this the second hours now are managed by a team and they figure
[02:06:06.160 --> 02:06:09.280]   out what they want to talk about. I come in the morning go, what are we talking about today?
[02:06:09.280 --> 02:06:13.600]   So it's so it's and it's so it's really, you know, it's a huge group of volunteers that are
[02:06:13.600 --> 02:06:16.480]   that have kind of put this that come together all over the world every day
[02:06:16.480 --> 02:06:21.280]   and have some great conversations. And so we spent an hour to this morning talking about comms.
[02:06:21.280 --> 02:06:23.840]   Yeah. Yeah. That's important.
[02:06:23.840 --> 02:06:29.520]   So studio, you need comms, baby. Absolutely. Nice. Go to office hours.global, sign up.
[02:06:29.520 --> 02:06:34.000]   You can register and join the discussion, which is great. And then of course, you can always
[02:06:34.000 --> 02:06:38.160]   just watch it. They have YouTube and so forth. But office hours, that global is the starting point.
[02:06:38.160 --> 02:06:41.440]   Thank you, Alex. Andy, what are you going to do GBH next?
[02:06:41.440 --> 02:06:48.480]   I was on last Friday. I'm off this week, but I'm on next week, my usual time and place 1245
[02:06:48.480 --> 02:06:54.160]   on Friday at the Boston Public Library. You can watch it live, listen to it live or later
[02:06:54.160 --> 02:07:03.280]   at wgphnews.org or go to YouTube, the YouTube channel, WGBH News to watch and stream it live or
[02:07:03.280 --> 02:07:08.880]   later. I do have one important note. Apparently that Edomonic research headphones, the price is
[02:07:08.880 --> 02:07:13.360]   good. You have to use a special link, however, to get it. If you just go to atorama.com, it will
[02:07:13.360 --> 02:07:19.360]   show you 150 dollar price. Okay. Flapping $10 off. But I'm pacing. I'm about to tweet out the link
[02:07:19.360 --> 02:07:24.560]   that I just gave in the show notes to make sure that the people actually get it. Apparently,
[02:07:24.560 --> 02:07:29.440]   it was available. The link was given away in email, but it worked for anybody, whether you got the
[02:07:29.440 --> 02:07:37.040]   email or not. So here's the deal. Follow Andy on Twitter. How do you spell a not-co? I have no idea.
[02:07:37.040 --> 02:07:45.200]   I-H-N-A-T-K-O. He's just at a not-co on the Twitter and he'll be tweeting that out. And other
[02:07:45.200 --> 02:07:49.600]   things, he's a tweeter. And I love your picture carrying the portal gun in front of the Office of
[02:07:49.600 --> 02:07:56.640]   Science and Technology Policy. They have, yeah, that office has a whole bunch of stuff on display,
[02:07:56.640 --> 02:08:04.480]   including some pieces of spacecraft that are really, really, very interesting.
[02:08:04.480 --> 02:08:08.800]   And the replica portal gun and everybody wants to pose with a portal gun, myself, not myself
[02:08:08.800 --> 02:08:17.760]   included. And I have to say, when I saw your Insta of this picture, I thought, "Wow, the timing
[02:08:17.760 --> 02:08:24.480]   on this was amazing." I was very impressed. And then I realized, "Oh, you were using mid- was it mid
[02:08:24.480 --> 02:08:28.240]   journey to make this?" Nope, that was Dolly, too. Dolly, too.
[02:08:28.240 --> 02:08:33.600]   He's using the Enfil feature. I love this with the Penguin on a skateboard and the raccoon
[02:08:33.600 --> 02:08:39.040]   trying to break into the Mini Cooper. I mean, this is with the fine art. And the
[02:08:39.040 --> 02:08:42.000]   squirrel enjoying coffee on the coffee shop on the kitty. Oh, I missed that. Oh, wait a minute.
[02:08:42.000 --> 02:08:46.160]   There's, oh, there's the squirrel and the kitty looking. All of that was added, huh?
[02:08:46.160 --> 02:08:51.760]   But yeah, Dolly, too. Yep. Nice. Well done. They're going to get a lot of my money in the
[02:08:51.760 --> 02:08:54.960]   past in the next month because there's a lot of time I need to waste in the office and it's an
[02:08:54.960 --> 02:09:00.080]   excellent way to waste it. What a great time, and what a great person to have on the show.
[02:09:00.080 --> 02:09:04.320]   Thank you. Thank you. And I want to know more about you're watching, "Did you get a Pixel 7, too?"
[02:09:04.320 --> 02:09:11.520]   I have the Pixel 7 Pro and we should talk the camera. Quick take, oh boy, the camera.
[02:09:11.520 --> 02:09:15.360]   And maybe if you want, we can talk about that next week or talk about it.
[02:09:15.360 --> 02:09:20.320]   My mind will come. I ordered it as a real human and it should be coming this week.
[02:09:20.880 --> 02:09:27.600]   Yeah. Can I just say the very, very funny story? So to me, it's our ironic story.
[02:09:27.600 --> 02:09:33.040]   So of course, I'm in New York City. I got to see what's playing at the Met that night.
[02:09:33.040 --> 02:09:37.360]   So of course, I went to the Met, a Met Opera performance that night.
[02:09:37.360 --> 02:09:43.680]   And I had really good house seats like 10th row in. So I said, "Ooh, I brought the,
[02:09:43.680 --> 02:09:49.280]   I bought the iPhone 14 Pro with me to take sample shots." Oh, wow, great opportunity to take
[02:09:49.280 --> 02:09:55.200]   sample shots with the iPhone Pro. Unfortunately, they were both the iPhone and the new Pixel were
[02:09:55.200 --> 02:10:00.240]   in the same pocket. I took out the wrong camera and I'm not allowed to post any of those pictures
[02:10:00.240 --> 02:10:05.440]   until tomorrow. So I couldn't even show to take pictures. I take pictures during the curtain
[02:10:05.440 --> 02:10:09.840]   calls only. And I got some great shots, but I can't share. Well, we'll see them tomorrow.
[02:10:09.840 --> 02:10:14.800]   Where will we see them on your Twitter? Instagram, Twitter, Flickr, and a couple other places.
[02:10:16.160 --> 02:10:20.960]   Thank you for letting us know ahead of time. I can't wait. Yes, you'll enjoy them. I will.
[02:10:20.960 --> 02:10:29.600]   I enjoyed them as well. Jason Snell rocks hard at sixcolors.com. Oh, man. Do I ever. And check out,
[02:10:29.600 --> 02:10:35.040]   I'm going to plug my podcast at the incomparable.com. This time, it's my little pop culture podcast
[02:10:35.040 --> 02:10:39.280]   network. A lot of fun stuff over there. The mothership show every week, we do a,
[02:10:39.280 --> 02:10:44.480]   we do an actual play D&D podcast called Total Party Kill. That's pretty fun and lots of places
[02:10:44.480 --> 02:10:49.360]   to jump in. And it is the only place, I think, that you can get an active, very funny,
[02:10:49.360 --> 02:10:56.240]   Magnum PI, old classic 80s Magnum PI podcast, which I do with David Lohr and Philip Michaels,
[02:10:56.240 --> 02:11:01.680]   which is a kick because we just basically get on a Zoom call and drink beer and talk about
[02:11:01.680 --> 02:11:06.480]   old episodes of TV from, you know, the 80s. Do you don't, do you don't watch while you're,
[02:11:06.480 --> 02:11:10.480]   or you do? No, we're not while we're doing it. We watch them beforehand and then talk about it.
[02:11:10.480 --> 02:11:13.920]   It's just like all those cool aftershows you have. I love those. Yeah, I love those.
[02:11:13.920 --> 02:11:17.680]   You know, when you're talking about modern shows, we just do it about Magnum PI from the 80s.
[02:11:17.680 --> 02:11:23.120]   It's the after after like the deep after show. Yeah, it's extremely, very far.
[02:11:23.120 --> 02:11:26.880]   We watched it 1992 and now we want to talk about it.
[02:11:26.880 --> 02:11:31.200]   Yeah. Where do you find all the episodes of Magnum? Who streams those?
[02:11:31.200 --> 02:11:35.040]   Oh, I don't know where they are right now. I bought them on iTunes, but they are available.
[02:11:35.040 --> 02:11:38.640]   And I think they're on one of the fast, I don't know if they're on Pluto or somewhere,
[02:11:38.640 --> 02:11:42.320]   but they're around. And then we've got like, there's a show called the complicated profession
[02:11:42.320 --> 02:11:46.640]   that Dan Morin does with his wife and with Tony Sindler, where they're talking about Star Wars.
[02:11:46.640 --> 02:11:49.840]   So they're talking about Andor right now. And we've got another show that's about
[02:11:49.840 --> 02:11:55.200]   all the MCU stuff. And so yeah, there's something there that you said your little network,
[02:11:55.200 --> 02:12:04.800]   you've got four eight, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32. A lot of shows there. 35 shows open to the public.
[02:12:04.800 --> 02:12:09.520]   And then another six members only and some retired shows too. Yeah. I mean, we're busy.
[02:12:09.520 --> 02:12:12.720]   Wow. It's bigger than Twit folks.
[02:12:12.720 --> 02:12:16.240]   Hide it in plain sight at the incomparable.com.
[02:12:16.240 --> 02:12:22.560]   Holy cow. And it's all for nerds. Shows for nerds. That's what it's for. Wow.
