[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.240]   As you can see by my dramatic single Leo is not here.
[00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:24.480]   He is off having adventures in the Europe land world.
[00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:26.360]   And Alex is also off having adventures,
[00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:28.000]   leaving me in charge.
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:29.240]   Please don't be distracted by the fact
[00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:32.160]   I don't have a big evil genius chair behind me.
[00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:35.080]   I've been told that Pottery Barn will be sending my free chair
[00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:36.080]   in due time.
[00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:38.520]   But until then, I've got a really wonderful lineup
[00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.080]   of guests and co-hosts to talk about everything Mac
[00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:43.320]   and iOS this week, starting with representing
[00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.600]   the mighty West Coast of North America,
[00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:46.920]   Chris Breen of Macworld.
[00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.160]   Chris, how have you been doing?
[00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:50.640]   I have been doing very well.
[00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:51.480]   Thank you.
[00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:52.840]   And thank you for calling out the West Coast.
[00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:56.000]   It's lovely here and our power is back on, thankfully.
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   (laughing)
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.480]   Electricity is a wonderful thing to have, isn't it?
[00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:01.400]   It's the kind of thing that you take for granted
[00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:03.200]   until you're without it for three days
[00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:05.360]   and your food has spoiled and you have no heat in.
[00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:08.720]   At which point, you rush to the local Starbucks
[00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:11.960]   and order a generator so that the next time this happens,
[00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:14.680]   you rule the neighborhood.
[00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:16.360]   - Starbucks is generators. - Starbucks is generators.
[00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:19.080]   Exactly, go to Carmel and 8,000 additional
[00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:20.520]   and this is our calories.
[00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:22.160]   - Exactly, right.
[00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:24.240]   - Yeah, I know exactly what you mean there
[00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:26.120]   because after the hurricane,
[00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:28.360]   I was about power for a solid week
[00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:31.640]   and the camping spirit goes away after the second or third day.
[00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:33.880]   The pioneer spirit leaves after day six
[00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:36.360]   and after the seventh day of pulling back into your driveway
[00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:39.200]   of having to maintain an office inside a Dunkin' Donuts
[00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:42.800]   with Wi-Fi 25 minute drive away,
[00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:44.800]   going back to a completely dark house
[00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:47.880]   with absolutely no snacks and no creature comforts,
[00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:50.600]   you get very Lord of the Rings-ish
[00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:52.080]   and not the good kind of Lord of the Rings.
[00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:53.720]   The sore on ish.
[00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:55.200]   Hey, look, hey, look, that land over there.
[00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:57.160]   I bet I could subjugate it and bend it to my will
[00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:58.280]   just because I'm evil.
[00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:59.600]   That's the sort of, fortunately,
[00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:01.000]   I on day eight, the power came back on.
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.720]   So yes, I feel very much for you.
[00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:05.400]   Representing not quite the East Coast,
[00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:09.000]   but nearly the East Coast, Adam Ainks of tidbits.com.
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.040]   Adam, how are you?
[00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:11.600]   - From your office in the Penn House,
[00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:13.560]   sweet at the Boston Monument, I see.
[00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:18.080]   - We're inland, so all those hurricanes miss us
[00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:19.080]   for the most part.
[00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:23.160]   You just get the wonderful weather up there in Ithaca.
[00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:25.240]   - Yeah, I can't say from much today,
[00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:27.800]   but it's actually Seattle weather today.
[00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:30.960]   It's about 42 degrees and foggy.
[00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:33.000]   So I'm getting those flashback feelings
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.240]   from the 10 years in Seattle.
[00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:38.560]   I will say though, this fall has actually been truly gorgeous.
[00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:42.360]   So 50s and 60s in November is just plain strange.
[00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:44.760]   Oh, wait, there's global warming, I forgot.
[00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:45.760]   (laughing)
[00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:47.400]   - Now, are you citing global warming
[00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:49.600]   as a support of global warming
[00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:51.920]   or as a denial of global warming?
[00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:55.440]   'Cause we can do that both ways when it's unseasonable.
[00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:56.880]   - Well, see in this particular case,
[00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:59.840]   it's hard to argue with really pleasant weather.
[00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:02.120]   So you're like, "Weee, global warming,
[00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:03.960]   I could take it for a little while."
[00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:06.920]   - As a runner, I guess that means
[00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:09.560]   that the months of extreme pain and misery,
[00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:10.760]   as opposed to the usual months
[00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:12.920]   of extreme discomfort and physical misery,
[00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:14.280]   have been stretched, have been delayed
[00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:15.240]   for at least another three weeks.
[00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:16.640]   So you gotta be happy about that, huh?
[00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:18.600]   - Well, see, it's not even a matter of delaying them.
[00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:20.280]   If you miss the cross-country season,
[00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:25.280]   you've lost weeks and weeks of running in snow and mud.
[00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:27.600]   And that's just, you know,
[00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:31.040]   I mean, you need some of it to maintain the cross-country cred,
[00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:35.640]   but honestly, racing in 30 degrees in water
[00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:37.840]   is not my idea of a good time.
[00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:39.640]   - Ah, there you go, that's why the rest of us
[00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:41.640]   have the Nintendo Wii cross-country.
[00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:43.360]   It's the exact same sense of achievement
[00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:46.360]   only without that outside with the day ball thing.
[00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:50.240]   And representing the other rather extreme East Coast
[00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:52.280]   of North America, we have Don McAllister.
[00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:55.280]   Don, thanks for coming in from the,
[00:04:55.280 --> 00:05:00.280]   you're the West Coast of the Atlantic Sea Board, yes.
[00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:03.720]   - Yeah, that's one way I put it, I suppose.
[00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:05.520]   Yeah, welcome from, hello from Europe.
[00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:07.000]   Yeah, I feel like I'm the only one
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:08.200]   who's not actually in the web.
[00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:10.960]   I mean, Paris is only, yeah, and I was flight from here,
[00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:13.080]   but I've not managed to get myself over to the web.
[00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:14.440]   I know that's where they go is this week
[00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:15.600]   and a few other people as well,
[00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:17.400]   but thank you for inviting me on.
[00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:20.680]   It's always good to be here on my break weekly.
[00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:22.400]   - Always glad to have you here.
[00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:23.920]   And again, we would like to extend to you
[00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:26.480]   the courtesy of being an honorary North American.
[00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:28.840]   So you should be very, very pleased and proud by that.
[00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:30.280]   We're gonna start off with, well, actually,
[00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:33.520]   actually maybe not so such an honor to be a North American
[00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:35.800]   because clearly only the United States of America
[00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:38.360]   can take a very, very odd little quirk
[00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:41.280]   of a beta personal voice assistant software
[00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:45.920]   and turn it into a major network, 24 hours cable news,
[00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:47.440]   kerfuffle.
[00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:52.200]   Now, before we start describing what this kerfuffle is,
[00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:56.120]   I'm gonna warn everybody around today
[00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:59.280]   that this is potentially a highly,
[00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:00.760]   highly controversial topic.
[00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:04.720]   So by all means, don't say anything controversial
[00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:06.320]   that would cause us to be picked up
[00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:08.800]   by these same 24 hour cable news channels
[00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:11.360]   and turn this into the highest rated episode
[00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:12.960]   of any Twitch podcast all year long.
[00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:16.440]   So I wanna caution you, do not do anything controversial.
[00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:18.840]   I would cause this show to be immensely profitable
[00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:19.880]   for all concerned.
[00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:23.280]   Now with that concerned, yes, some rather,
[00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:24.440]   well, can we call them silly?
[00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:26.720]   I will stop at saying call and call them silly.
[00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:29.920]   Journalists have noticed that if you ask Siri
[00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:33.920]   on an iPhone 4S where I can get abortion services,
[00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:36.600]   Siri will not be able to find you said abortion services.
[00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:39.880]   And if you ask, hey, Siri, why are you anti-abortion
[00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:41.600]   according to one of these news reports,
[00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:45.120]   Siri will say, I just am or just might.
[00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:46.760]   Now I'm gonna hand it off to you, Adam,
[00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:49.480]   because I think you posted the definitive rebuttal
[00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:51.880]   to this on tidbits the other day.
[00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:54.800]   Let me set it up for you.
[00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:57.280]   Should we be concerned about this political stance
[00:06:57.280 --> 00:06:59.200]   being taken by Apple and articulated
[00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:01.240]   through their built in software, Adam?
[00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:04.840]   (Adam laughs)
[00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:07.680]   Sorry. Yeah.
[00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:10.560]   This was just ridiculous.
[00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:13.160]   I heard about it first because a friend of mine
[00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:15.880]   sent me email from moveon.org
[00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:18.760]   that he had gotten, telling them, asking him to,
[00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:23.280]   go sign a petition about how telling Apple
[00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:25.200]   that they were really upset with Apple
[00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:29.160]   for being anti-abortion and how Siri was just saying,
[00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:32.520]   well, when asked if you were a favor of a,
[00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:36.000]   you know, against abortion, Siri just said, I just am.
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:40.520]   And I was just flabbergasted at the level
[00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:45.520]   to which people were taking this fairly basic,
[00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:49.360]   you know, sort of search and response thing
[00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:51.520]   and making Apple corporate policy out of it.
[00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:53.600]   I mean, I can't even get a straight answer out of Apple PR
[00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:56.440]   most of the time as to where Apple corporate policy.
[00:07:56.440 --> 00:07:58.840]   And you expect you're gonna get it out of Siri?
[00:07:58.840 --> 00:08:01.520]   So yeah, it was really quite shocking
[00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:06.520]   just how this caught on and really continued
[00:08:06.520 --> 00:08:10.320]   in the face of just, you know, people not realizing
[00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:12.560]   what could possibly be going on here.
[00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:17.200]   Yeah, I mean, also if they'd asked the second question,
[00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:19.400]   realizing that I don't know, I just am,
[00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:21.520]   is one of the eight like canned responses
[00:08:21.520 --> 00:08:23.320]   that Siri hands up, Siri hands up
[00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:26.040]   when you ask a Siri a question about itself.
[00:08:26.040 --> 00:08:31.240]   And there's, Chris, is there any other obvious reason
[00:08:31.240 --> 00:08:34.080]   why, you know, this allegation from move on
[00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:35.680]   is kind of not quite correct.
[00:08:35.680 --> 00:08:37.640]   And maybe even again, I'm being charitable
[00:08:37.640 --> 00:08:39.200]   by calling it silly, aren't I?
[00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:42.920]   >> Yeah, I would say Asinine, but that's, you know.
[00:08:42.920 --> 00:08:45.200]   >> See, that's why, unfortunately,
[00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:46.400]   it's hard to be in the hosting chair
[00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:47.960]   because it's my job as host to say,
[00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:50.520]   now what is your, Chris, you're an expert on iOS,
[00:08:50.520 --> 00:08:54.040]   what would be your assessment of this news report?
[00:08:54.040 --> 00:08:55.040]   >> Or I'm Asinine.
[00:08:55.040 --> 00:08:57.000]   >> Counting on you to say Asinine.
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:00.120]   >> Yeah, it's like these people have never conducted
[00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:02.360]   a Google search in their entire life.
[00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:06.960]   And it requires that every so often you enter a search term
[00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:09.000]   and you end up with results that don't match
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:10.040]   what you're searching for.
[00:09:10.040 --> 00:09:14.000]   And it's not because Google is out to change the world
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:15.320]   or has a political viewpoint,
[00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:18.720]   it's just that you didn't conduct a very good search query.
[00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:21.720]   So I don't know about you where you guys are
[00:09:21.720 --> 00:09:24.720]   on the East Coast or how it is in Britain,
[00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:27.680]   but I know around here, we do not have places
[00:09:27.680 --> 00:09:29.960]   called Abortions R Us.
[00:09:30.280 --> 00:09:31.560]   Just doesn't work out.
[00:09:31.560 --> 00:09:34.480]   >> Well, there's a trademark issue mostly there.
[00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:35.760]   >> Ah, okay.
[00:09:35.760 --> 00:09:37.920]   >> It's the backwards R that's the problem.
[00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:39.080]   >> Now I see.
[00:09:39.080 --> 00:09:41.920]   So if you talk to Siri and say,
[00:09:41.920 --> 00:09:44.000]   where can I find abortion services,
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:47.120]   it is not making a moral judgment.
[00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:49.160]   And it's not saying, well, I don't, you know,
[00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:50.680]   I'm not sure that I agree with this,
[00:09:50.680 --> 00:09:54.360]   but rather it's looking up for very basic searches
[00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:57.200]   and says, I don't see the word abortions anywhere.
[00:09:57.200 --> 00:10:00.000]   I tried this just saying family planning
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.320]   and I still ended up with some very hazy results.
[00:10:03.320 --> 00:10:06.560]   So Google is better because if you were to type family planning
[00:10:06.560 --> 00:10:08.000]   in there, you'd probably get better results,
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:12.600]   but Siri searching is a little half baked at this point.
[00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:14.520]   So no, they haven't conducted a web search.
[00:10:14.520 --> 00:10:16.840]   And two, they've never used Siri before
[00:10:16.840 --> 00:10:18.840]   because if they had, they would have understood
[00:10:18.840 --> 00:10:21.600]   that these are the kind of results you get every so often,
[00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:23.960]   asking for the most benign things.
[00:10:23.960 --> 00:10:26.560]   And yet it may still say, gee, I'm sorry,
[00:10:26.560 --> 00:10:27.960]   I don't know where you live.
[00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:31.200]   Or I don't, what's donut?
[00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:34.360]   So it tickles me though,
[00:10:34.360 --> 00:10:37.440]   in that it sort of gives the impression that someone at Apple
[00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:40.160]   is actually carefully hand crafting all these responses
[00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:43.680]   that now what might someone ask when they speak to Siri?
[00:10:43.680 --> 00:10:45.720]   I know, let's configure this.
[00:10:45.720 --> 00:10:46.960]   When obviously we all know, you know,
[00:10:46.960 --> 00:10:48.360]   it doesn't work like that as Chris said,
[00:10:48.360 --> 00:10:51.120]   it's basically a search engine and it's, you know,
[00:10:51.120 --> 00:10:52.840]   there are certain algorithms that it can respond to,
[00:10:52.840 --> 00:10:54.360]   the certain information it has at hand.
[00:10:54.360 --> 00:10:57.760]   It's certainly not sort of being filtered or hand crafted
[00:10:57.760 --> 00:11:00.040]   by the team of people, Apple, who are responsible
[00:11:00.040 --> 00:11:02.200]   for putting together two responses.
[00:11:02.200 --> 00:11:04.480]   So it strikes me as a little bit of people
[00:11:04.480 --> 00:11:07.680]   not quite understanding the technology really.
[00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:09.040]   Adam, you're about to say?
[00:11:09.040 --> 00:11:11.560]   Well, I was gonna say that the thing that is interesting
[00:11:11.560 --> 00:11:14.640]   is that when you start poking hard at Siri,
[00:11:14.640 --> 00:11:18.280]   you can find some interesting holes
[00:11:18.280 --> 00:11:22.320]   that it's clearly not hand-coded because that's just dumb.
[00:11:22.320 --> 00:11:26.120]   On the other hand, Siri is basically keyword matching
[00:11:26.120 --> 00:11:30.000]   off certain things and attempting to go to categories
[00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:31.480]   in a database.
[00:11:31.480 --> 00:11:35.480]   And so, you know, abortion services just isn't a category
[00:11:35.480 --> 00:11:37.960]   in whatever series location-based database is.
[00:11:37.960 --> 00:11:41.680]   And yet, there's something that's causing those keywords
[00:11:41.680 --> 00:11:44.560]   to trigger over to location stuff rather than just
[00:11:44.560 --> 00:11:46.560]   have Siri throw up its hands and say,
[00:11:46.560 --> 00:11:49.480]   okay, do a Google search, I really don't know.
[00:11:49.480 --> 00:11:54.040]   And so there are some limitations here
[00:11:54.040 --> 00:11:55.760]   that I think Apple can fix.
[00:11:55.760 --> 00:11:58.280]   I was honestly a little disappointed in Apple's response
[00:11:58.280 --> 00:12:02.600]   to the New York Times where they kind of meekly said,
[00:12:02.600 --> 00:12:06.000]   oh, we're so sorry, there's still some kinks
[00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.720]   in the product because it's in beta.
[00:12:08.720 --> 00:12:13.320]   And, you know, what bug to me was is that that implies
[00:12:13.320 --> 00:12:17.040]   when it's finally released, it's gonna be perfect.
[00:12:17.040 --> 00:12:19.440]   No, it's still gonna make these kind of mistakes.
[00:12:19.440 --> 00:12:21.080]   You know, there'll be different ones,
[00:12:21.080 --> 00:12:22.680]   I'm sure they'll fix that one.
[00:12:22.680 --> 00:12:24.720]   You know, they will hard code that one in there
[00:12:24.720 --> 00:12:26.160]   just to avoid the problem.
[00:12:26.160 --> 00:12:31.160]   But this is how these kind of database-driven search engine
[00:12:31.160 --> 00:12:33.880]   like devices work.
[00:12:33.880 --> 00:12:35.440]   And it's always gonna have something.
[00:12:35.440 --> 00:12:37.600]   And we've seen these kinds of problems crop up.
[00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:40.440]   I was desperate, I couldn't find the reference.
[00:12:40.440 --> 00:12:42.200]   Maybe one of you guys remembers as well.
[00:12:42.200 --> 00:12:46.880]   But weren't there some issues with the computer,
[00:12:46.880 --> 00:12:51.160]   the built-in user dictionaries in either Microsoft products
[00:12:51.160 --> 00:12:53.480]   or on the early in Mac OS X,
[00:12:53.480 --> 00:12:57.200]   like not having certain words or providing certain kinds
[00:12:57.200 --> 00:13:01.720]   of suggestions to misspelled words
[00:13:01.720 --> 00:13:04.760]   and people extrapolating from that too.
[00:13:04.760 --> 00:13:09.440]   - Yeah, it's a little bit like those Nicholas Cage
[00:13:09.440 --> 00:13:12.840]   treasure hunter movies where in order to hide a fortune
[00:13:12.840 --> 00:13:15.160]   in gold the founding fathers decide to,
[00:13:15.160 --> 00:13:17.000]   instead of simply saying, oh, by the way,
[00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:18.480]   here's the message, here's where it's hidden.
[00:13:18.480 --> 00:13:20.600]   They decided to make it 81 layers deep
[00:13:20.600 --> 00:13:22.840]   to make sure that you have to follow exactly the right path
[00:13:22.840 --> 00:13:24.640]   to find the actual solution.
[00:13:24.640 --> 00:13:27.360]   But it does kind of raise an interesting point though.
[00:13:27.360 --> 00:13:30.440]   When you're using, Siri is not like any other search tool.
[00:13:30.440 --> 00:13:32.800]   When you're using Bing or Google,
[00:13:32.800 --> 00:13:34.840]   you know that you're the one who's filtering
[00:13:34.840 --> 00:13:35.840]   their responses yourself.
[00:13:35.840 --> 00:13:37.160]   All you're doing is plugging in keywords
[00:13:37.160 --> 00:13:38.680]   and getting a list of results that,
[00:13:38.680 --> 00:13:39.920]   that hit off those keywords.
[00:13:39.920 --> 00:13:42.880]   But conceivably, the way that you interact with Siri
[00:13:42.880 --> 00:13:44.440]   is to ask a human being a question
[00:13:44.440 --> 00:13:46.640]   and to expect and trust and answer.
[00:13:46.640 --> 00:13:49.040]   So I wonder how much thought and how much work goes
[00:13:49.040 --> 00:13:51.920]   in an apple to process a question like,
[00:13:51.920 --> 00:13:54.920]   I think I might have mixed my medications.
[00:13:54.920 --> 00:13:56.520]   I'm a little, my vision's a little bit blurry.
[00:13:56.520 --> 00:13:58.080]   What do I do?
[00:13:58.080 --> 00:14:00.080]   Do you do a keyword search off of that?
[00:14:00.080 --> 00:14:02.920]   Do you admittedly send this person to the closest
[00:14:02.920 --> 00:14:04.520]   immediate care facility?
[00:14:04.520 --> 00:14:07.440]   Do you treat it like a potential suicide?
[00:14:07.440 --> 00:14:08.720]   And I know these are heavy things,
[00:14:08.720 --> 00:14:12.320]   but it's an example of when someone comes to expect
[00:14:12.320 --> 00:14:15.720]   the same search utility that can show you
[00:14:15.720 --> 00:14:18.120]   where do I find a burrito at this hour
[00:14:18.120 --> 00:14:20.520]   in Milwaukee, Wisconsin to have the answers
[00:14:20.520 --> 00:14:21.960]   to any question that you might have,
[00:14:21.960 --> 00:14:23.920]   especially when it's something that this is the closest thing
[00:14:23.920 --> 00:14:26.240]   that I have to me in an emergency situation.
[00:14:26.240 --> 00:14:28.320]   And I don't necessarily have the ability
[00:14:28.320 --> 00:14:29.880]   to type out a long response.
[00:14:29.880 --> 00:14:32.080]   So what role do you think Apple should take?
[00:14:32.080 --> 00:14:35.440]   - Well, that's a really, really interesting question.
[00:14:35.440 --> 00:14:38.360]   And I was having a conversation on Google+,
[00:14:38.360 --> 00:14:40.240]   about this, and one guy, actually Steve Doorna,
[00:14:40.240 --> 00:14:42.480]   our author of "Udora," way back when comments
[00:14:42.480 --> 00:14:46.240]   that he, a friend of his who had once had to call 911
[00:14:46.240 --> 00:14:47.920]   during a break in in his house,
[00:14:47.920 --> 00:14:52.280]   said, "It turns out to be really hard to dial 911
[00:14:52.280 --> 00:14:54.360]   "when you're freaked out."
[00:14:54.360 --> 00:14:57.360]   That the whole, people saying,
[00:14:57.360 --> 00:14:59.560]   "Oh, well, who would you seriate an emergency situation?"
[00:14:59.560 --> 00:15:02.240]   Well, I don't know, it seems to me that you're gonna,
[00:15:02.240 --> 00:15:04.160]   you're not thinking very clearly
[00:15:04.160 --> 00:15:07.000]   in an emergency situation, who knows what you're gonna do,
[00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:10.220]   and you're certainly not gonna be doing a clever,
[00:15:10.220 --> 00:15:13.040]   well done Google's, well done search.
[00:15:13.040 --> 00:15:17.020]   So I do think Apple has some work to do there
[00:15:17.020 --> 00:15:22.020]   to figure out what kinds of queries,
[00:15:22.020 --> 00:15:27.020]   or what kinds of, I don't know if they can do intonation
[00:15:27.020 --> 00:15:30.240]   or sort of be able to try to determine
[00:15:30.240 --> 00:15:32.520]   if there's some, like the person that there's a motion,
[00:15:32.520 --> 00:15:35.020]   or a person is scared, or something like that.
[00:15:35.020 --> 00:15:38.200]   And to really, I don't know, hard code that off
[00:15:38.200 --> 00:15:42.700]   to some kind of, do you need me to call emergency services?
[00:15:42.700 --> 00:15:47.540]   And then send that to the phone app for a 911 call.
[00:15:47.540 --> 00:15:51.340]   But that's an issue Apple has to be talking about,
[00:15:51.340 --> 00:15:52.660]   and they have to be thinking about,
[00:15:52.660 --> 00:15:55.100]   because it will come up.
[00:15:55.100 --> 00:15:57.300]   - Chris, do you know anything special
[00:15:57.300 --> 00:16:00.460]   about the series back end that would make that easier,
[00:16:00.460 --> 00:16:01.900]   harder, and one of the things that occurs to me
[00:16:01.900 --> 00:16:04.060]   is that maybe there's a trap door fail safe,
[00:16:04.060 --> 00:16:05.420]   that says that at some point,
[00:16:05.420 --> 00:16:08.200]   Siri can, the server can understand that
[00:16:08.200 --> 00:16:09.860]   this is a really complicated question.
[00:16:09.860 --> 00:16:10.680]   I don't understand it.
[00:16:10.680 --> 00:16:12.680]   Why don't I kick it to an actual human being?
[00:16:12.680 --> 00:16:14.520]   It'll take an extra eight seconds, get a response,
[00:16:14.520 --> 00:16:16.240]   but maybe that'll fine tune things better.
[00:16:16.240 --> 00:16:17.320]   Is such a thing even possible,
[00:16:17.320 --> 00:16:19.680]   or would it even violate the privacy agreement
[00:16:19.680 --> 00:16:21.320]   that the user has with Apple?
[00:16:21.320 --> 00:16:22.680]   If it did that?
[00:16:22.680 --> 00:16:24.400]   - Well, that would be my concern.
[00:16:24.400 --> 00:16:26.960]   And I think maybe that would be Apple's as well is,
[00:16:26.960 --> 00:16:30.720]   do you, I mean, people, I think when people use Siri,
[00:16:30.720 --> 00:16:34.660]   as much as it has a human-ish voice to it,
[00:16:34.660 --> 00:16:37.040]   I think we all understand that there is a computer,
[00:16:37.040 --> 00:16:39.640]   there's some kind of technology working behind there.
[00:16:39.640 --> 00:16:43.100]   I think people would be concerned if whatever they were
[00:16:43.100 --> 00:16:46.080]   asking for went to a real human being,
[00:16:46.080 --> 00:16:48.720]   that somehow they could scratch out a note better
[00:16:48.720 --> 00:16:51.760]   than something else could keep track of you, which is silly.
[00:16:51.760 --> 00:16:54.520]   But I do think it would be a privacy issue
[00:16:54.520 --> 00:16:56.880]   for a lot of people thinking, you know, this is,
[00:16:56.880 --> 00:16:59.880]   I mean, we already have enough issues about privacy
[00:16:59.880 --> 00:17:02.640]   in these devices, and we're gonna talk about that later,
[00:17:02.640 --> 00:17:04.780]   that I think when you put a human being in there,
[00:17:04.780 --> 00:17:06.380]   it makes people uncomfortable,
[00:17:06.380 --> 00:17:08.340]   because this is a very personal device,
[00:17:08.340 --> 00:17:12.260]   and when you have a query that you're sending,
[00:17:12.260 --> 00:17:14.300]   which may be a little embarrassing,
[00:17:14.300 --> 00:17:16.180]   like you're looking for a birth control
[00:17:16.180 --> 00:17:17.340]   or something at a certain time,
[00:17:17.340 --> 00:17:19.500]   or you're concerned about a health issue,
[00:17:19.500 --> 00:17:23.940]   do you really want a human to have access to that query?
[00:17:23.940 --> 00:17:25.820]   And even though they may provide you information,
[00:17:25.820 --> 00:17:28.540]   I think people would feel rocky about that.
[00:17:28.540 --> 00:17:30.740]   - Yeah, well, you mentioned another,
[00:17:30.740 --> 00:17:32.440]   this is a two kerfuffle show.
[00:17:32.440 --> 00:17:34.880]   Apple was lucky enough to have a second kerfuffle
[00:17:34.880 --> 00:17:36.640]   drop in their lap last week.
[00:17:36.640 --> 00:17:41.080]   When a kerfuffle involving user privacy of the iPhone,
[00:17:41.080 --> 00:17:42.880]   this is the second user privacy kerfuffle
[00:17:42.880 --> 00:17:45.480]   that the iPhone has had in the past year and a half
[00:17:45.480 --> 00:17:48.800]   starting with when it turned out that backups of the iPhone
[00:17:48.800 --> 00:17:53.120]   were dumping a very clearly, a loose,
[00:17:53.120 --> 00:17:57.040]   but still informative log of where this phone has been
[00:17:57.040 --> 00:17:59.000]   over the past X months.
[00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:01.380]   Apple had responded to that and do a correction.
[00:18:01.380 --> 00:18:04.620]   Last week's kerfuffle had to do with a piece of software
[00:18:04.620 --> 00:18:08.680]   called Carrier IQ that a researcher found on HTC phones
[00:18:08.680 --> 00:18:11.900]   that seemed to have been given logs that he was able
[00:18:11.900 --> 00:18:14.540]   to generate diagnostically.
[00:18:14.540 --> 00:18:16.700]   A piece of software located on the phone installed
[00:18:16.700 --> 00:18:21.580]   by the carrier that could get access to URLs
[00:18:21.580 --> 00:18:25.040]   that you've been using, cell towers that this phone
[00:18:25.040 --> 00:18:28.180]   had been connecting to, even the text of text messages
[00:18:28.180 --> 00:18:31.140]   that you have been sent seemingly a lot more information
[00:18:31.140 --> 00:18:33.860]   that a random piece of software you'd think should be able
[00:18:33.860 --> 00:18:36.100]   to collect from a phone, particularly one
[00:18:36.100 --> 00:18:37.700]   of the super top secret.
[00:18:37.700 --> 00:18:40.300]   The company that makes Carrier IQ handled it,
[00:18:40.300 --> 00:18:42.300]   I think in a way that almost any PR person would say
[00:18:42.300 --> 00:18:44.900]   was exactly the right way to handle it if you want
[00:18:44.900 --> 00:18:46.900]   to send business away from their current PR person
[00:18:46.900 --> 00:18:49.740]   towards something competent, like themselves.
[00:18:49.740 --> 00:18:53.100]   They decided to attack this researcher,
[00:18:53.100 --> 00:18:55.420]   bring lawyers right down in his head,
[00:18:55.420 --> 00:18:58.380]   try to legally force him to retract his statements
[00:18:58.380 --> 00:19:01.700]   about what Carrier IQ software was doing on this agency phone,
[00:19:01.700 --> 00:19:05.100]   and also release a statement that they themselves
[00:19:05.100 --> 00:19:07.260]   had written about how wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong,
[00:19:07.260 --> 00:19:09.660]   he was about what the Carrier IQ software was doing.
[00:19:09.660 --> 00:19:12.100]   He ran, of course, directly to the Electronic Frontier
[00:19:12.100 --> 00:19:15.020]   Foundation, which is the, proves its metal
[00:19:15.020 --> 00:19:17.220]   and its usefulness to the internet community
[00:19:17.220 --> 00:19:19.740]   more and more with each passing month,
[00:19:19.740 --> 00:19:22.140]   gave him an adequate defense, and so he came out back
[00:19:22.140 --> 00:19:24.620]   with a YouTube video that even more clearly explained,
[00:19:24.620 --> 00:19:26.700]   "Here is what happens when I touch this button on the phone.
[00:19:26.700 --> 00:19:28.700]   "Hey, look, it's logging that keystroke.
[00:19:28.700 --> 00:19:30.340]   "Here's what happens when I do a web search.
[00:19:30.340 --> 00:19:32.900]   "Hey, look, Carrier IQ software is logging this thing,
[00:19:32.900 --> 00:19:35.860]   "and maybe it also has hooks possibly to the outside."
[00:19:35.860 --> 00:19:38.460]   And it turned out, so this turned it to a huge problem
[00:19:38.460 --> 00:19:40.500]   for lots and lots of handset makers.
[00:19:40.500 --> 00:19:42.900]   It didn't take long for a researcher to discover
[00:19:42.900 --> 00:19:46.780]   that there are at least references to Carrier IQ
[00:19:46.780 --> 00:19:49.620]   on the iPhone that caused a lot of people who,
[00:19:49.620 --> 00:19:52.180]   I think in the Apple community, their first reaction was,
[00:19:52.180 --> 00:19:54.540]   "Well, you know that this is going to happen
[00:19:54.540 --> 00:19:57.540]   "on an Android phone where they can put anything
[00:19:57.540 --> 00:19:59.860]   "that they walked and the user doesn't have."
[00:19:59.860 --> 00:20:03.660]   - But there was a hook to Carrier IQ on the iPhone.
[00:20:03.660 --> 00:20:05.900]   "Ah, Zebra, blivin' hands."
[00:20:05.900 --> 00:20:06.900]   (laughs)
[00:20:06.900 --> 00:20:08.620]   Excuse me, a little bit, a little bit packed,
[00:20:08.620 --> 00:20:09.900]   little bit dehydrated.
[00:20:09.900 --> 00:20:11.660]   (laughs)
[00:20:11.660 --> 00:20:13.700]   Chris, I think that you probably know exactly
[00:20:13.700 --> 00:20:15.940]   what we're talking about here and what Apple's,
[00:20:15.940 --> 00:20:18.420]   what the actual extent of the quote-promun quote was
[00:20:18.420 --> 00:20:20.820]   for at least Apple for the software.
[00:20:20.820 --> 00:20:24.220]   - Well, Apple has said that since iOS 5 has been out,
[00:20:24.220 --> 00:20:28.180]   they are no longer tracking through Carrier IQ.
[00:20:28.180 --> 00:20:30.460]   Now, what would I say no longer tracking?
[00:20:30.460 --> 00:20:31.820]   Were they ever tracking?
[00:20:31.820 --> 00:20:33.380]   - Well, that's, you're right, that's, sorry,
[00:20:33.380 --> 00:20:35.900]   let me back up, that Carrier IQ
[00:20:35.900 --> 00:20:38.220]   and the other carriers will all say,
[00:20:38.220 --> 00:20:40.260]   "You know, that's not what this is for.
[00:20:40.260 --> 00:20:44.220]   "What we're using it for is to see how the phone is performing,
[00:20:44.220 --> 00:20:46.740]   "what kind of cell coverage we're getting,
[00:20:46.740 --> 00:20:48.060]   "when apps are crashing."
[00:20:48.060 --> 00:20:50.220]   So these, and it's all anonymous, it's not,
[00:20:50.220 --> 00:20:51.940]   we don't care that you've texted this,
[00:20:51.940 --> 00:20:55.140]   we can't track SMS messages or phone calls
[00:20:55.140 --> 00:20:58.660]   or any details of documents you may have created
[00:20:58.660 --> 00:21:00.100]   on this device.
[00:21:00.100 --> 00:21:02.660]   Rather, this is very, very general
[00:21:02.660 --> 00:21:05.020]   and isn't targeted at you.
[00:21:05.020 --> 00:21:07.140]   Apple, however, has said with iOS 5
[00:21:07.140 --> 00:21:09.140]   that in their diagnostic information,
[00:21:09.140 --> 00:21:11.180]   this data is not included.
[00:21:11.180 --> 00:21:13.660]   Also, you have the option on an iOS device
[00:21:13.660 --> 00:21:15.940]   to not enable diagnostic data
[00:21:15.940 --> 00:21:17.500]   and it's not on by default.
[00:21:17.500 --> 00:21:19.340]   You have to actually switch it on.
[00:21:19.340 --> 00:21:22.860]   So it's, Apple came out with this defense,
[00:21:22.860 --> 00:21:24.900]   Carrier IQ again is saying,
[00:21:24.900 --> 00:21:26.260]   "That's not what's happening here."
[00:21:26.260 --> 00:21:27.700]   The carriers are also saying,
[00:21:27.700 --> 00:21:29.620]   even in their secret documents,
[00:21:29.620 --> 00:21:31.940]   are saying, "This isn't really a problem,
[00:21:31.940 --> 00:21:34.500]   "this is a PR problem."
[00:21:34.500 --> 00:21:36.420]   And certainly it's something they're gonna want to go back
[00:21:36.420 --> 00:21:38.460]   and look at as will the carriers.
[00:21:38.460 --> 00:21:41.020]   I think the broader issue for people,
[00:21:41.020 --> 00:21:41.900]   as I was saying earlier,
[00:21:41.900 --> 00:21:44.180]   is that these are very personal devices.
[00:21:44.180 --> 00:21:48.460]   We understand that Google is keeping track
[00:21:48.460 --> 00:21:50.060]   of some of our searches
[00:21:50.060 --> 00:21:51.300]   and they're using that information
[00:21:51.300 --> 00:21:52.460]   to sell to advertisers.
[00:21:52.460 --> 00:21:54.620]   Facebook is doing the same kind of thing.
[00:21:54.620 --> 00:21:56.740]   But I think we feel so protected
[00:21:56.740 --> 00:22:00.940]   in such a large crowd that it isn't quite such a big deal.
[00:22:00.940 --> 00:22:02.780]   Personally, I'm creeped out by Facebook
[00:22:02.780 --> 00:22:03.740]   and I won't belong to it,
[00:22:03.740 --> 00:22:05.460]   but a lot of other people don't mind.
[00:22:05.460 --> 00:22:07.740]   But when it's your own phone
[00:22:07.740 --> 00:22:09.980]   and it's information that you personally have brought in,
[00:22:09.980 --> 00:22:14.580]   this I think has set off the Spidey single
[00:22:14.580 --> 00:22:16.660]   for a lot of people where they think,
[00:22:16.660 --> 00:22:17.980]   yeah, go ahead.
[00:22:17.980 --> 00:22:20.020]   There's an interesting aspect to that, Chris,
[00:22:20.020 --> 00:22:21.940]   which is I think there's a difference
[00:22:21.940 --> 00:22:24.940]   between what Google and Facebook and the like
[00:22:24.940 --> 00:22:26.540]   are often doing,
[00:22:26.540 --> 00:22:29.060]   which is that they are,
[00:22:29.060 --> 00:22:31.340]   there's sort of one level removed
[00:22:31.340 --> 00:22:32.900]   where they're tracking,
[00:22:32.900 --> 00:22:36.860]   they're sort of looking at what you do,
[00:22:36.860 --> 00:22:39.700]   whereas at least in some of the situations,
[00:22:39.700 --> 00:22:40.940]   the carrier IQ,
[00:22:40.940 --> 00:22:45.660]   it was recording your actual words and thoughts.
[00:22:45.660 --> 00:22:48.420]   And that feels to me a little different.
[00:22:48.420 --> 00:22:50.540]   So with Google,
[00:22:50.540 --> 00:22:53.020]   you sort of know that they sort of know where you're going
[00:22:53.020 --> 00:22:54.060]   and things like that,
[00:22:54.060 --> 00:22:55.220]   but there isn't that sense
[00:22:55.220 --> 00:22:58.900]   that they're actually reading the URLs
[00:22:58.900 --> 00:23:01.820]   and looking at the web forms on the websites
[00:23:01.820 --> 00:23:03.460]   you go to and things like that,
[00:23:03.460 --> 00:23:04.540]   whereas with carrier IQ,
[00:23:04.540 --> 00:23:06.100]   the fact that this guy could say,
[00:23:06.100 --> 00:23:07.980]   "Look, I type in this text message
[00:23:07.980 --> 00:23:10.460]   "and here it is in my log,
[00:23:10.460 --> 00:23:12.220]   "whether or not the carriers were actually
[00:23:12.220 --> 00:23:14.740]   "using that feature of carrier IQ
[00:23:14.740 --> 00:23:18.500]   "that it was there at all is really freaky."
[00:23:18.500 --> 00:23:20.820]   - Yeah, that's true, I'm sorry, Chris.
[00:23:20.820 --> 00:23:21.940]   I'm sorry, go ahead, Chris.
[00:23:21.940 --> 00:23:25.780]   - Yeah, I think that in addition to it being very personal,
[00:23:25.780 --> 00:23:28.340]   I think that a lot of people have the sense
[00:23:28.340 --> 00:23:30.900]   that it's inevitable that we're gonna be tracked
[00:23:30.900 --> 00:23:33.740]   and that companies like Facebook
[00:23:33.740 --> 00:23:35.900]   and other instances
[00:23:35.900 --> 00:23:40.500]   are pushing the boundaries of what they can get away with.
[00:23:40.500 --> 00:23:42.260]   How much can we pull from you?
[00:23:42.260 --> 00:23:44.140]   What can we do to our privacy settings
[00:23:44.140 --> 00:23:47.100]   to make them as least private as possible
[00:23:47.100 --> 00:23:50.020]   until a governing body steps in and says,
[00:23:50.020 --> 00:23:52.460]   "You can't do that, oh, sorry."
[00:23:52.460 --> 00:23:54.700]   And then they back off and then wait
[00:23:54.700 --> 00:23:56.580]   and then they push it again to see how it goes.
[00:23:56.580 --> 00:23:59.860]   And then we have anyone who would protect us from that,
[00:23:59.860 --> 00:24:01.380]   which would be our legislators,
[00:24:01.380 --> 00:24:03.460]   one, having a clue what's going on
[00:24:03.460 --> 00:24:06.220]   because they seem to be completely stupid about technology
[00:24:06.220 --> 00:24:10.140]   and two, move so slowly when the industry is moving so quickly
[00:24:10.140 --> 00:24:13.020]   that they can't seem to close enough doors,
[00:24:13.020 --> 00:24:17.260]   and we've lost this moral compass of how much is too much.
[00:24:17.260 --> 00:24:18.300]   At what point do we say,
[00:24:18.300 --> 00:24:20.740]   no, you can't have access to this information.
[00:24:20.740 --> 00:24:22.060]   Yes, it's good for your business.
[00:24:22.060 --> 00:24:24.100]   Yes, it may even be good for your customer
[00:24:24.100 --> 00:24:27.340]   in certain instances, but it has to stop at some point.
[00:24:27.340 --> 00:24:28.660]   - Well, what's that's going on about this?
[00:24:28.660 --> 00:24:29.500]   - Well, that's what's that's going on about this.
[00:24:29.500 --> 00:24:33.780]   - Well, basically had to slap Facebook around
[00:24:33.780 --> 00:24:35.020]   a little bit last week,
[00:24:35.020 --> 00:24:39.860]   making them calling their privacy controls actively deceptive.
[00:24:39.860 --> 00:24:41.740]   It's a very long entertainment PDF
[00:24:41.740 --> 00:24:44.100]   you can find on the FTC.gov site.
[00:24:44.100 --> 00:24:46.340]   It's not simply, oh, well, we don't think you're secure enough.
[00:24:46.340 --> 00:24:49.420]   And well, we'd like you to look at this, Mr. Facebook.
[00:24:49.420 --> 00:24:50.980]   It was no, here's point by point,
[00:24:50.980 --> 00:24:54.100]   every way that you have basically hosed over all of your users
[00:24:54.100 --> 00:24:55.780]   by lying, excuse me,
[00:24:55.780 --> 00:24:58.260]   it's really pre-strang language.
[00:24:58.260 --> 00:25:01.140]   It is very frank language.
[00:25:01.140 --> 00:25:03.100]   They're saying, no, you are actively deceptive.
[00:25:03.100 --> 00:25:05.860]   You were telling them that by switching this privacy setting
[00:25:05.860 --> 00:25:07.820]   to this setting, you're making things more secure.
[00:25:07.820 --> 00:25:10.140]   When in fact, you're actually causing them to expose
[00:25:10.140 --> 00:25:11.660]   even more information,
[00:25:11.660 --> 00:25:15.020]   just squirting it out of a different gun port than before.
[00:25:15.020 --> 00:25:16.820]   So I think that we're definitely gonna see
[00:25:16.820 --> 00:25:18.180]   some blowback from this.
[00:25:18.180 --> 00:25:20.540]   So already there was the inevitable announcement
[00:25:20.540 --> 00:25:22.580]   of a class action suit against pretty much every
[00:25:22.580 --> 00:25:25.860]   handset maker that was using carrier IQ, including Apple.
[00:25:25.860 --> 00:25:28.540]   So when this is settled in three years time,
[00:25:28.540 --> 00:25:31.340]   see if you can plan on how you're gonna use your 12 cent
[00:25:31.340 --> 00:25:32.780]   iTunes credit that you're gonna get
[00:25:32.780 --> 00:25:34.300]   as part of your settlement package.
[00:25:34.300 --> 00:25:37.540]   But maybe we're seeing an error in which these things
[00:25:37.540 --> 00:25:40.660]   are getting so public and at least,
[00:25:40.660 --> 00:25:43.980]   this is an area in which if you scare people,
[00:25:43.980 --> 00:25:46.740]   at least it makes them aware that of all the information
[00:25:46.740 --> 00:25:48.820]   they're exposing just by carrying one of these things
[00:25:48.820 --> 00:25:51.220]   around in their pockets 24 hours a day.
[00:25:51.220 --> 00:25:53.420]   I mean, with Apple's problem was not necessarily
[00:25:53.420 --> 00:25:55.460]   that they were collecting location information
[00:25:55.460 --> 00:25:57.100]   that was identifiable to the person,
[00:25:57.100 --> 00:25:59.300]   but that they weren't securing it properly.
[00:25:59.300 --> 00:26:02.260]   So that if a third party, be it a bad guy
[00:26:02.260 --> 00:26:04.220]   or even a person in law enforcement,
[00:26:04.220 --> 00:26:07.260]   decided that, hey, I know that this person has an iPhone.
[00:26:07.260 --> 00:26:09.140]   If I can get access to their computer for about 10 minutes,
[00:26:09.140 --> 00:26:12.340]   I can download a complete log of vaguely where they've been.
[00:26:12.340 --> 00:26:16.300]   So if they said that they've never been to Oregon,
[00:26:16.300 --> 00:26:17.500]   I can prove, well, no, actually,
[00:26:17.500 --> 00:26:19.420]   I think that this phone says you have been to Oregon.
[00:26:19.420 --> 00:26:21.100]   So that's something you don't want your phone
[00:26:21.100 --> 00:26:22.860]   telling you people about.
[00:26:22.860 --> 00:26:24.140]   - I do think that's one interesting thing.
[00:26:24.140 --> 00:26:25.380]   - Okay, done.
[00:26:25.380 --> 00:26:28.660]   - Yeah, I do think that Apple have dodged a huge PR bullet
[00:26:28.660 --> 00:26:30.660]   with it not being an iOS 5.
[00:26:30.660 --> 00:26:32.780]   And the timing of the iOS 5 release
[00:26:32.780 --> 00:26:34.620]   and the story actually coming to light
[00:26:34.620 --> 00:26:37.020]   was I think it's been pretty good for Apple.
[00:26:37.020 --> 00:26:40.140]   Had they still have included it in iOS 5,
[00:26:40.140 --> 00:26:43.140]   I think the story would be an order of magnitude greater
[00:26:43.140 --> 00:26:43.980]   than it already is.
[00:26:43.980 --> 00:26:45.060]   And it's quite scary as it is now,
[00:26:45.060 --> 00:26:47.300]   but had Apple have been found to have it
[00:26:47.300 --> 00:26:48.580]   on their current phones as well,
[00:26:48.580 --> 00:26:49.780]   I think it would have been blown up
[00:26:49.780 --> 00:26:51.380]   by quite a bit more than it is now.
[00:26:51.380 --> 00:26:52.860]   But it is really scary.
[00:26:52.860 --> 00:26:54.780]   I mean, the things that the guy was actually showing
[00:26:54.780 --> 00:26:59.780]   on the phone, even doing calls to Google, using HTTPS,
[00:26:59.780 --> 00:27:02.860]   it actually intercepted that before it actually went to Google
[00:27:02.860 --> 00:27:04.300]   so you could see all the strings and everything,
[00:27:04.300 --> 00:27:06.020]   and text messages coming in.
[00:27:06.020 --> 00:27:09.140]   It's not so much that, well, it is bad that it's doing it,
[00:27:09.140 --> 00:27:11.740]   but my concern is what's happening with the data.
[00:27:11.740 --> 00:27:13.220]   Is it actually getting off the phone
[00:27:13.220 --> 00:27:14.140]   when it does go off the phone?
[00:27:14.140 --> 00:27:16.300]   If it does go off, what are they actually doing with it then?
[00:27:16.300 --> 00:27:18.660]   And is it properly anonymized?
[00:27:18.660 --> 00:27:21.500]   - Yeah, I was, when I wrote about this last,
[00:27:21.500 --> 00:27:22.540]   I'll go ahead, go ahead.
[00:27:22.540 --> 00:27:25.860]   - I was just gonna say, I don't know the quite the details,
[00:27:25.860 --> 00:27:28.860]   but my understanding is the EU has a very much
[00:27:28.860 --> 00:27:32.780]   more stringent privacy requirements in the US.
[00:27:32.780 --> 00:27:35.340]   And I don't know if the UK participates in those,
[00:27:35.340 --> 00:27:38.100]   but do you see a different attitude towards this
[00:27:38.100 --> 00:27:39.300]   in England?
[00:27:39.300 --> 00:27:41.540]   - You know, a lot of the tech press,
[00:27:41.540 --> 00:27:44.580]   I've not really seen much about it, to be honest.
[00:27:44.580 --> 00:27:46.260]   It's been fairly low key, I think,
[00:27:46.260 --> 00:27:47.220]   from this side of the pond.
[00:27:47.220 --> 00:27:48.060]   I don't know what not,
[00:27:48.060 --> 00:27:50.220]   'cause there are still things to be proven yet,
[00:27:50.220 --> 00:27:52.180]   but as far as I am aware,
[00:27:52.180 --> 00:27:54.460]   anyway, from the sources that I sort of check,
[00:27:54.460 --> 00:27:56.540]   it's mainly been in the tech news
[00:27:56.540 --> 00:27:58.860]   and not so much in the general news as yet.
[00:27:58.860 --> 00:28:04.300]   - So, but if something like this came out,
[00:28:04.300 --> 00:28:08.020]   which would be in violation of the EU privacy requirements,
[00:28:08.020 --> 00:28:10.060]   would that be, you know,
[00:28:10.060 --> 00:28:13.060]   cause for a huge, huge hullabaloo,
[00:28:13.060 --> 00:28:15.860]   and, you know, the EU hammering companies
[00:28:15.860 --> 00:28:16.740]   in a really big way?
[00:28:16.740 --> 00:28:18.060]   Or, I mean, is it different,
[00:28:18.060 --> 00:28:19.660]   or are we just sort of, you know,
[00:28:19.660 --> 00:28:21.780]   are we, does the EU do this stuff better,
[00:28:21.780 --> 00:28:24.980]   or are we simply all kind of under the gun here?
[00:28:24.980 --> 00:28:27.540]   - They do take it very seriously, I think,
[00:28:27.540 --> 00:28:29.060]   but whether or not they do it better
[00:28:29.060 --> 00:28:30.580]   than other places, they're not too sure.
[00:28:30.580 --> 00:28:32.980]   But, you know, if something is proven,
[00:28:32.980 --> 00:28:37.140]   they can make quite strange demands on companies.
[00:28:37.140 --> 00:28:39.140]   - Yeah, I think that's gonna show
[00:28:39.140 --> 00:28:41.420]   how important it is the companies respond to these things
[00:28:41.420 --> 00:28:43.580]   very, very quickly, learn from their mistakes
[00:28:43.580 --> 00:28:45.060]   and establish a good track record.
[00:28:45.060 --> 00:28:46.940]   Apple is generally trustworthy,
[00:28:46.940 --> 00:28:49.260]   because although that location information problem
[00:28:49.260 --> 00:28:52.500]   from earlier was pretty embarrassing,
[00:28:52.500 --> 00:28:53.820]   now I think that when,
[00:28:53.820 --> 00:28:56.740]   the first time I learned that when you turn Siri off,
[00:28:56.740 --> 00:28:58.500]   one of the first things that the phone does
[00:28:58.500 --> 00:29:01.700]   is delete all logs of everything you've been doing with Siri,
[00:29:01.700 --> 00:29:04.300]   so that at least there's no information left on your phone
[00:29:04.300 --> 00:29:06.060]   when you selectively decide to turn it off.
[00:29:06.060 --> 00:29:08.340]   I think that has to be at least an after effect
[00:29:08.340 --> 00:29:11.340]   of all the PR problems that they had earlier on.
[00:29:11.340 --> 00:29:13.740]   We are going to take a break and thank one of our sponsors,
[00:29:13.740 --> 00:29:15.860]   I'm gonna hand things over to our grand poo bar
[00:29:15.860 --> 00:29:17.860]   and minister of information,
[00:29:17.860 --> 00:29:19.020]   especially advertising,
[00:29:19.020 --> 00:29:20.340]   really information,
[00:29:20.340 --> 00:29:23.380]   Leo LaPorte with a message from go to meeting.
[00:29:23.380 --> 00:29:24.820]   - Andy, if you don't mind,
[00:29:24.820 --> 00:29:26.020]   I'd just like interrupt for a moment
[00:29:26.020 --> 00:29:29.100]   to talk a little bit about go to meeting.
[00:29:29.100 --> 00:29:31.660]   Go to meeting, you know, the holidays are here,
[00:29:31.660 --> 00:29:34.740]   bad weather, sick days, and just travel.
[00:29:34.740 --> 00:29:37.060]   You don't wanna necessarily be at the office the whole time,
[00:29:37.060 --> 00:29:38.260]   right?
[00:29:38.260 --> 00:29:40.980]   Maybe you wanna go to Paris, I don't know.
[00:29:40.980 --> 00:29:42.980]   Well, that's where go to meeting is fantastic
[00:29:42.980 --> 00:29:45.900]   because no matter where you or your colleagues
[00:29:45.900 --> 00:29:48.180]   or your clients are, you can meet with them,
[00:29:48.180 --> 00:29:50.300]   even in an impromptu meeting,
[00:29:50.300 --> 00:29:52.740]   just over the internet using go to meeting.
[00:29:52.740 --> 00:29:55.020]   Yes, go to meeting, it's online meeting software,
[00:29:55.020 --> 00:29:58.140]   it's done right, it's fast, it's secure,
[00:29:58.140 --> 00:30:01.300]   it's easy for you and even easier for your clients
[00:30:01.300 --> 00:30:03.700]   and colleagues and I like that.
[00:30:03.700 --> 00:30:06.180]   You get screen sharing and also with HD Faces,
[00:30:06.180 --> 00:30:09.100]   this new feature, those of you who are meeting
[00:30:09.100 --> 00:30:11.700]   from desktops can actually show video,
[00:30:11.700 --> 00:30:12.580]   everybody gets to see it,
[00:30:12.580 --> 00:30:14.820]   but you need a desktop computer to show the video.
[00:30:14.820 --> 00:30:16.260]   And now with go to meeting,

[00:31:21.300 --> 00:31:25.200]   Now back to the boys and Macbreak Weekly, Andy.
[00:31:25.200 --> 00:31:27.820]   - Thank you Leo, even when reporting
[00:31:27.820 --> 00:31:30.860]   from the Matrix he is still authoritative and impressive.
[00:31:30.860 --> 00:31:35.020]   Last week, those of us,
[00:31:35.020 --> 00:31:36.740]   this is the season in which Apple,
[00:31:36.740 --> 00:31:38.700]   the Apple news tends to center more on lawsuits
[00:31:38.700 --> 00:31:40.460]   than actual product shipped.
[00:31:40.460 --> 00:31:42.500]   So there's a cool piece of news last week
[00:31:42.500 --> 00:31:46.020]   that I think a lot of you have already heard about.
[00:31:46.020 --> 00:31:48.460]   Apple's ongoing fight against Samsung,
[00:31:48.460 --> 00:31:50.940]   trying to insist that hey, Samsung stole a lot
[00:31:50.940 --> 00:31:52.740]   of our technology, violates a lot of our patents
[00:31:52.740 --> 00:31:54.700]   and so they shouldn't be allowed to sell phones
[00:31:54.700 --> 00:31:57.780]   and tablets in the Godfearing parts of the world
[00:31:57.780 --> 00:31:59.700]   or the universe in larger sense.
[00:31:59.700 --> 00:32:03.260]   The judge that handled the case last week
[00:32:03.260 --> 00:32:06.380]   declined to issue an injunction against Samsung
[00:32:06.380 --> 00:32:09.620]   and published her decision.
[00:32:09.620 --> 00:32:12.660]   Unfortunately, and this is where the comedy comes in,
[00:32:12.660 --> 00:32:15.900]   it was published as a PDF in which certain sections
[00:32:15.900 --> 00:32:17.780]   were redacted, they were blacked out,
[00:32:17.780 --> 00:32:19.220]   which is sort of a common thing
[00:32:19.220 --> 00:32:22.060]   if there is what might be termed technological secrets
[00:32:22.060 --> 00:32:23.180]   for a certain number of months,
[00:32:23.180 --> 00:32:24.540]   perhaps those things are gonna be blocked
[00:32:24.540 --> 00:32:27.220]   from the official record until they can be cleared out again.
[00:32:27.220 --> 00:32:30.060]   Unfortunately, whoever did it decided to simply use
[00:32:30.060 --> 00:32:33.020]   the simple feature that just leaves the text intact
[00:32:33.020 --> 00:32:35.740]   but simply covers up with a graphical box
[00:32:35.740 --> 00:32:38.740]   that the reader software has to then use
[00:32:38.740 --> 00:32:41.460]   and it took about 0.3 seconds for every million different
[00:32:41.460 --> 00:32:43.140]   tech blogs to realize if you simply cut
[00:32:43.140 --> 00:32:44.620]   and paste it into a new document,
[00:32:44.620 --> 00:32:46.180]   you can read the entire decision
[00:32:46.180 --> 00:32:48.460]   with all the blacked out parts in their full glory.
[00:32:48.460 --> 00:32:50.820]   And there are a couple of interesting bits of Apple news
[00:32:50.820 --> 00:32:53.420]   that we're able to be extracted from this.
[00:32:53.420 --> 00:32:56.140]   Oh, by the way, first kudos go to theverge.com.
[00:32:56.140 --> 00:32:59.940]   Josh's new tech blog, kudos to him.
[00:32:59.940 --> 00:33:03.180]   But one interesting tidbit is that Apple does,
[00:33:03.180 --> 00:33:04.420]   or at least at least on one occasion,
[00:33:04.420 --> 00:33:05.900]   has licensed some of their patents
[00:33:05.900 --> 00:33:07.100]   and some of their iOS technology
[00:33:07.100 --> 00:33:08.100]   to other handset makers.
[00:33:08.100 --> 00:33:12.060]   It, the ruling mentions the a scrolling behavior,
[00:33:12.060 --> 00:33:14.780]   which I think the verge identified as that,
[00:33:14.780 --> 00:33:17.300]   when you scroll on an iPhone to a long, long list
[00:33:17.300 --> 00:33:18.580]   of something, you get to the end,
[00:33:18.580 --> 00:33:19.940]   you get the sort of elastic effect
[00:33:19.940 --> 00:33:22.980]   where it sort of stretches up and reveals the linen background
[00:33:22.980 --> 00:33:26.300]   and snaps back down that was years and years
[00:33:26.300 --> 00:33:29.540]   of people dying, just like in the Manhattan Project,
[00:33:29.540 --> 00:33:32.740]   who unleashed the secrets of the elastic bottom
[00:33:32.740 --> 00:33:34.540]   and then releasing it.
[00:33:34.540 --> 00:33:36.900]   Now Apple has licensed this to other manufacturers,
[00:33:36.900 --> 00:33:38.820]   saying that Samsung did not license this
[00:33:38.820 --> 00:33:40.260]   and that was part of the problem.
[00:33:40.260 --> 00:33:42.980]   The other tidbit that revealed is that,
[00:33:42.980 --> 00:33:44.780]   according to Apple itself,
[00:33:44.780 --> 00:33:47.900]   itself does not believe that Samsung,
[00:33:47.900 --> 00:33:49.180]   these Samsung devices,
[00:33:49.180 --> 00:33:52.700]   so they do fringe on Apple's patents and copyrights,
[00:33:52.700 --> 00:33:55.860]   they don't believe that it will steal any sales away
[00:33:55.860 --> 00:33:58.180]   from iPhones that will just simply cannibalize
[00:33:58.180 --> 00:33:59.820]   other Android phones instead,
[00:33:59.820 --> 00:34:01.060]   so that actually would work better
[00:34:01.060 --> 00:34:05.820]   for Apple's business practices than anybody else's.
[00:34:05.820 --> 00:34:09.220]   Is this news, Chris, have you ever heard
[00:34:09.220 --> 00:34:11.300]   of Apple licensing their own technology
[00:34:11.300 --> 00:34:12.460]   out to other handset makers?
[00:34:12.460 --> 00:34:15.980]   No, I haven't, but I'm not surprised.
[00:34:15.980 --> 00:34:18.820]   I think there's an awful lot that Apple does to make money
[00:34:18.820 --> 00:34:20.580]   and it makes deals with other people.
[00:34:20.580 --> 00:34:23.500]   I mean, because Samsung isn't only a company
[00:34:23.500 --> 00:34:24.940]   that is competing with Apple,
[00:34:24.940 --> 00:34:26.340]   they're also Apple's partner
[00:34:26.340 --> 00:34:28.260]   in some other ways for components,
[00:34:28.260 --> 00:34:31.900]   so I could see that there could very well be
[00:34:31.900 --> 00:34:34.820]   friendly relationship in parts of their business
[00:34:34.820 --> 00:34:38.620]   where they say, "Yeah, look, we need to lock out anybody else
[00:34:38.620 --> 00:34:40.460]   from using these components that you're providing."
[00:34:40.460 --> 00:34:42.540]   So in the meantime,
[00:34:42.540 --> 00:34:44.980]   if you'd like to just take this binder
[00:34:44.980 --> 00:34:47.580]   into that other room for the next five minutes,
[00:34:47.580 --> 00:34:50.660]   it will just conveniently look over here.
[00:34:50.660 --> 00:34:53.540]   And if that feature were to show up on some of your devices,
[00:34:53.540 --> 00:34:55.580]   oh, aren't you clever to have found
[00:34:55.580 --> 00:34:57.700]   a different way to do that than we do?
[00:34:57.700 --> 00:35:01.780]   So no, I'm not terribly surprised that Apple is doing this
[00:35:01.780 --> 00:35:05.940]   and also it makes sense to me that it's going to cannibalize
[00:35:05.940 --> 00:35:08.020]   Android devices rather than Apple devices.
[00:35:08.020 --> 00:35:12.980]   I still think that in terms of the iPhone and the iPad
[00:35:12.980 --> 00:35:16.340]   and iOS devices, that's really it's Apple
[00:35:16.340 --> 00:35:17.500]   and everybody else.
[00:35:17.500 --> 00:35:20.980]   If you want the cool device, you're going to get the Apple
[00:35:20.980 --> 00:35:23.060]   device and if you want something, if you want to stroll in
[00:35:23.060 --> 00:35:25.580]   and say, "Well, I need a smartphone, but I don't want to pay
[00:35:25.580 --> 00:35:27.220]   40 bucks or I want it free."
[00:35:27.220 --> 00:35:29.140]   They'll say, "Yeah, well, here's this thing here."
[00:35:29.140 --> 00:35:31.100]   And look at, "No, good, I'll use that.
[00:35:31.100 --> 00:35:32.380]   Thank you very much."
[00:35:32.380 --> 00:35:35.500]   - But Adam, do you think this is a little bit
[00:35:35.500 --> 00:35:36.580]   against Apple's character?
[00:35:36.580 --> 00:35:38.260]   They've always been talked about how protective they are
[00:35:38.260 --> 00:35:39.620]   about their own technology.
[00:35:39.620 --> 00:35:41.940]   Also, there are at least these two different tidbits
[00:35:41.940 --> 00:35:43.700]   or tell kind of a different story
[00:35:43.700 --> 00:35:46.220]   about what Apple's public position has always been
[00:35:46.220 --> 00:35:49.020]   about how we're the little guys and we're being attacked
[00:35:49.020 --> 00:35:51.700]   by Android, they want to crush us, they want to kill us.
[00:35:51.700 --> 00:35:54.460]   And we're so like, lost little lambs tethered in the middle
[00:35:54.460 --> 00:35:56.540]   of a game preserve who will protect us,
[00:35:56.540 --> 00:35:58.100]   but the United States government.
[00:35:58.100 --> 00:36:01.180]   Is this like sort of out of character
[00:36:01.180 --> 00:36:03.020]   or is this just really a distressingly
[00:36:03.020 --> 00:36:05.540]   in character for Apple to have one,
[00:36:05.540 --> 00:36:07.260]   one set of opinions inside the courtroom
[00:36:07.260 --> 00:36:09.660]   and other set of expressions outside the courtroom?
[00:36:09.660 --> 00:36:14.020]   - Well, yeah, I do think the whole, you know,
[00:36:14.020 --> 00:36:16.460]   Apple is this weak little company
[00:36:16.460 --> 00:36:19.300]   that needs all the protection it can get.
[00:36:19.300 --> 00:36:22.540]   Maybe a stance that some lawyers are attempting to take,
[00:36:22.540 --> 00:36:26.260]   but you know, given the size and the power and dominance
[00:36:26.260 --> 00:36:29.740]   of Apple in general, I think everyone's just laughing at it
[00:36:29.740 --> 00:36:31.820]   as an approach.
[00:36:31.820 --> 00:36:33.060]   And I don't think Apple believes it.
[00:36:33.060 --> 00:36:35.860]   I think Apple is pretty confident of their ability
[00:36:35.860 --> 00:36:37.980]   to crush the other kids and, oh wait,
[00:36:37.980 --> 00:36:39.380]   that was from a while ago.
[00:36:41.460 --> 00:36:44.900]   So they, yeah, Apple, I think is, you know,
[00:36:44.900 --> 00:36:46.700]   confident they can compete
[00:36:46.700 --> 00:36:49.340]   and they're going to compete in every aspect
[00:36:49.340 --> 00:36:50.860]   of the business world.
[00:36:50.860 --> 00:36:54.340]   And some of that includes filing lawsuits,
[00:36:54.340 --> 00:36:56.180]   even some of which may be frivolous
[00:36:56.180 --> 00:36:57.700]   or what you don't expect to win,
[00:36:57.700 --> 00:37:00.540]   which you expect to be using as delaying tactics
[00:37:00.540 --> 00:37:04.100]   or to increase cost of goods for the competition.
[00:37:04.100 --> 00:37:07.340]   What I guess I find most frustrating about this
[00:37:07.340 --> 00:37:10.380]   when you first ask Chris, you know, is this news?
[00:37:10.380 --> 00:37:11.900]   I don't think it is news.
[00:37:11.900 --> 00:37:14.220]   I think it's not news in exactly the way
[00:37:14.220 --> 00:37:18.900]   that so much of what appears in the news media is not news.
[00:37:18.900 --> 00:37:20.380]   It's gamesmanship.
[00:37:20.380 --> 00:37:21.660]   It's all about the game.
[00:37:21.660 --> 00:37:25.260]   It has nothing to do with, is the iPad a good device,
[00:37:25.260 --> 00:37:27.660]   is the, you know, is this particular Android tablet,
[00:37:27.660 --> 00:37:30.220]   a good device, a better device, a worse device.
[00:37:30.220 --> 00:37:32.580]   That's information.
[00:37:32.580 --> 00:37:34.220]   That's interesting stuff.
[00:37:34.220 --> 00:37:37.820]   The news as, who's ahead right now?
[00:37:37.820 --> 00:37:42.820]   Who's made this strategic move to block the other guy?
[00:37:42.820 --> 00:37:44.460]   That's just, I mean, it's football.
[00:37:44.460 --> 00:37:45.860]   It's soccer, it's basketball.
[00:37:45.860 --> 00:37:48.660]   It has nothing to do with reality.
[00:37:48.660 --> 00:37:51.300]   It's just taking it one step apart
[00:37:51.300 --> 00:37:53.300]   and turning it into a game.
[00:37:53.300 --> 00:37:55.500]   And it bugs me in politics
[00:37:55.500 --> 00:37:58.180]   and it bugs me in the business world as well.
[00:37:58.180 --> 00:38:00.140]   It happens, but that doesn't mean
[00:38:00.140 --> 00:38:02.700]   it's what we should be focusing on.
[00:38:02.700 --> 00:38:04.980]   - But Don, I want Don to come in on this.
[00:38:04.980 --> 00:38:08.700]   There's the weird and sort of distressing
[00:38:08.700 --> 00:38:11.620]   for an Apple fan realization that Android phones
[00:38:11.620 --> 00:38:13.900]   are getting less easy to make fun of
[00:38:13.900 --> 00:38:15.220]   with each passing year.
[00:38:15.220 --> 00:38:16.900]   Now they're still pretty hysterical.
[00:38:16.900 --> 00:38:18.580]   I don't want to say there's no comedy
[00:38:18.580 --> 00:38:20.500]   to be found in the Android platform,
[00:38:20.500 --> 00:38:22.820]   particularly as the screens get larger and larger.
[00:38:22.820 --> 00:38:25.420]   But I've held a couple of different Android phones
[00:38:25.420 --> 00:38:27.180]   that I thought were pretty darn good.
[00:38:27.180 --> 00:38:29.580]   And if I really did want a phone
[00:38:29.580 --> 00:38:32.300]   that could double as a 4G mobile hotspot when I travel,
[00:38:32.300 --> 00:38:35.620]   or if I had a certain affection for a larger screen,
[00:38:35.620 --> 00:38:38.340]   I'm not quite ready to buy a Kindle Fire
[00:38:38.340 --> 00:38:40.740]   or something with a larger tablet size yet.
[00:38:40.740 --> 00:38:42.540]   But I do want a little bit of extra screen real estate
[00:38:42.540 --> 00:38:43.900]   so I can watch movies and read books
[00:38:43.900 --> 00:38:44.900]   look more comfortably.
[00:38:44.900 --> 00:38:46.420]   That's kind of attractive.
[00:38:46.420 --> 00:38:48.940]   I mean, is Apple at least trying to,
[00:38:48.940 --> 00:38:50.780]   maybe they're trying to be a little bit more proactive
[00:38:50.780 --> 00:38:53.220]   for not the phones that are coming out today,
[00:38:53.220 --> 00:38:54.740]   but the phones that might come out a year or two
[00:38:54.740 --> 00:38:56.500]   from now, in your opinion?
[00:38:56.500 --> 00:38:57.340]   - I don't know.
[00:38:57.340 --> 00:38:59.100]   I think Apple are a strategic player.
[00:38:59.100 --> 00:39:00.620]   I mean, they, you know,
[00:39:00.620 --> 00:39:02.220]   it's really not the next six months.
[00:39:02.220 --> 00:39:03.340]   It's the next three or four years
[00:39:03.340 --> 00:39:04.460]   that they're looking down the track.
[00:39:04.460 --> 00:39:06.740]   So, you know, and we've seen this with,
[00:39:06.740 --> 00:39:08.980]   like, you know, the bulk memory purchases and stuff.
[00:39:08.980 --> 00:39:10.500]   You know, they sort of wipe the market clean
[00:39:10.500 --> 00:39:13.580]   and take up certain bits of kit they use
[00:39:13.580 --> 00:39:16.340]   for their applications and their equipment.
[00:39:16.340 --> 00:39:17.660]   But the such a strategic player,
[00:39:17.660 --> 00:39:20.220]   you've gone to think that lots of these licensing deals
[00:39:20.220 --> 00:39:23.420]   are being done, you know, for a purpose.
[00:39:23.420 --> 00:39:24.860]   And I've always said as well,
[00:39:24.860 --> 00:39:26.820]   I do believe, and I think Chris said this as well,
[00:39:26.820 --> 00:39:29.540]   that there are iPhone users and there's everybody else.
[00:39:29.540 --> 00:39:32.220]   And if someone wants an iPhone,
[00:39:32.220 --> 00:39:34.340]   they will go and they will buy an iPhone online
[00:39:34.340 --> 00:39:36.380]   or they'll go to a store and they'll seek out an iPhone,
[00:39:36.380 --> 00:39:38.940]   but do the research, they'll buy the device that they want.
[00:39:38.940 --> 00:39:41.740]   And then the people who just want to buy a phone.
[00:39:41.740 --> 00:39:43.260]   And, you know, they'll just go into the store and say,
[00:39:43.260 --> 00:39:44.980]   right, what's the latest and greatest phone?
[00:39:44.980 --> 00:39:47.060]   I don't really want to pay a premium price.
[00:39:47.060 --> 00:39:48.340]   You know, I'm not interested in the iPhone
[00:39:48.340 --> 00:39:49.940]   'cause that's really expensive, you know.
[00:39:49.940 --> 00:39:52.700]   And basically they will be sold an Android device,
[00:39:52.700 --> 00:39:55.420]   which meets their budget and their requirements.
[00:39:55.420 --> 00:39:57.780]   So, the getting better and better and better,
[00:39:57.780 --> 00:40:00.900]   I really don't see that being Android fans
[00:40:00.900 --> 00:40:04.220]   and Apple fans, you know, iPhone and Android fans,
[00:40:04.220 --> 00:40:08.740]   I think that the two quite different communities.
[00:40:08.740 --> 00:40:12.020]   And it's only really the, I hate the word fanboy,
[00:40:12.020 --> 00:40:14.380]   but you know, someone who appreciates the Apple product
[00:40:14.380 --> 00:40:16.940]   and the Apple ecosystem or has, you know,
[00:40:16.940 --> 00:40:19.500]   the rest of the components that make up the Apple ecosystem,
[00:40:19.500 --> 00:40:22.020]   the Apple TV for a play or, you know, they have a Mac
[00:40:22.020 --> 00:40:23.500]   or they have an iPad, you know,
[00:40:23.500 --> 00:40:25.340]   they will polarize towards getting an iPhone.
[00:40:25.340 --> 00:40:28.860]   And the matter really what happens on the Android side.
[00:40:28.860 --> 00:40:31.860]   I don't think any of the Android manufacturers
[00:40:31.860 --> 00:40:34.020]   could actually make a single device
[00:40:34.020 --> 00:40:35.820]   that would sort of tempt someone away
[00:40:35.820 --> 00:40:37.660]   who's already heavily invested in Apple
[00:40:37.660 --> 00:40:41.140]   and has Apple sensibilities to sort of moving across.
[00:40:41.140 --> 00:40:43.940]   I think really Android is just mopping up the rest
[00:40:43.940 --> 00:40:45.460]   of the market for those people who aren't interested
[00:40:45.460 --> 00:40:47.140]   in the iPhone.
[00:40:47.140 --> 00:40:48.660]   - But Apple has a lot to protect.
[00:40:48.660 --> 00:40:51.740]   I mean, it's incredible the amount of reach
[00:40:51.740 --> 00:40:53.580]   and influence that Apple has to the iTunes store,
[00:40:53.580 --> 00:40:57.660]   that there's the dominant music retailer
[00:40:57.660 --> 00:41:00.420]   from almost any category you can name,
[00:41:00.420 --> 00:41:02.500]   that they have such a dominant app infrastructure,
[00:41:02.500 --> 00:41:05.740]   but that they still, those are just all those services
[00:41:05.740 --> 00:41:07.260]   and all those software are just tools
[00:41:07.260 --> 00:41:08.460]   they use to sell hardware,
[00:41:08.460 --> 00:41:10.220]   which is where they make all their money from.
[00:41:10.220 --> 00:41:12.020]   So if somebody ever cracks the code
[00:41:12.020 --> 00:41:14.660]   and figures out a way to make hardware,
[00:41:14.660 --> 00:41:17.340]   that's a hardware and an ecosystem that's so attractive
[00:41:17.340 --> 00:41:20.420]   that maybe that someone's next phone won't be an iPhone,
[00:41:20.420 --> 00:41:21.620]   maybe it will be a Windows phone,
[00:41:21.620 --> 00:41:23.900]   a 7.5 or Windows phone eight.
[00:41:23.900 --> 00:41:26.020]   I've had one of those for the past couple of weeks
[00:41:26.020 --> 00:41:28.020]   to play with them and that's pretty darn good.
[00:41:28.020 --> 00:41:31.780]   I mean, Apple might have more to protect in the coming years
[00:41:31.780 --> 00:41:34.900]   than they might seem at first blush.
[00:41:34.900 --> 00:41:37.300]   - Yeah, I think they've got a huge lead though.
[00:41:37.300 --> 00:41:38.340]   I mean, they've got a couple of years
[00:41:38.340 --> 00:41:39.580]   and everybody else and that makes,
[00:41:39.580 --> 00:41:41.260]   I think that's a telling difference.
[00:41:41.260 --> 00:41:42.260]   Now, in a couple of years time,
[00:41:42.260 --> 00:41:43.740]   when people have had chance to catch up,
[00:41:43.740 --> 00:41:46.100]   perhaps there might be more of a level playing field,
[00:41:46.100 --> 00:41:48.100]   but in that time again, Apple will progress,
[00:41:48.100 --> 00:41:49.540]   Apple will bring out new more devices
[00:41:49.540 --> 00:41:53.020]   and do additional things with the ecosystem
[00:41:53.020 --> 00:41:54.380]   and the back end as well.
[00:41:54.380 --> 00:41:57.060]   So the way I see it really is that
[00:41:57.060 --> 00:41:58.780]   it is a catch up race at the moment
[00:41:58.780 --> 00:42:00.740]   for other manufacturers trying to catch up
[00:42:00.740 --> 00:42:02.220]   and trying to leapfrog Apple.
[00:42:02.220 --> 00:42:03.660]   And it's that leapfrogging that people
[00:42:03.660 --> 00:42:05.140]   don't quite seem to be able to do.
[00:42:05.140 --> 00:42:08.060]   They can just about catch up and then,
[00:42:08.060 --> 00:42:10.180]   well, Apple's off again with the next release
[00:42:10.180 --> 00:42:11.780]   or the next product cycle or whatever.
[00:42:11.780 --> 00:42:14.300]   And I think vendors are really struggling
[00:42:14.300 --> 00:42:16.820]   to try and leapfrog Apple to bring the next greatest
[00:42:16.820 --> 00:42:18.340]   and best thing out.
[00:42:19.260 --> 00:42:21.060]   >> I think the company that I would actually look at
[00:42:21.060 --> 00:42:26.220]   is in fact Amazon because Amazon has the ecosystem
[00:42:26.220 --> 00:42:29.940]   and they understand the concept of lock-in,
[00:42:29.940 --> 00:42:32.460]   using DRM, which everyone, all the publishers
[00:42:32.460 --> 00:42:34.780]   and video companies want,
[00:42:34.780 --> 00:42:39.020]   but they use the DRM to lock you into their ecosystem.
[00:42:39.020 --> 00:42:41.700]   And that's something that Apple has taken
[00:42:41.700 --> 00:42:43.500]   huge advantage of as well.
[00:42:43.500 --> 00:42:45.060]   Amazon uses a different approach,
[00:42:45.060 --> 00:42:48.980]   spreading their apps and services across many platforms
[00:42:48.980 --> 00:42:51.940]   where as Apple requires you to buy Apple hardware.
[00:42:51.940 --> 00:42:56.020]   But it's nonetheless an interesting competition.
[00:42:56.020 --> 00:42:58.100]   And it reminds me a little bit of how Apple
[00:42:58.100 --> 00:43:00.900]   and Google and Microsoft all somehow compete
[00:43:00.900 --> 00:43:04.540]   while still using completely different business models.
[00:43:04.540 --> 00:43:07.180]   And so it's these weird competitions
[00:43:07.180 --> 00:43:09.220]   where no one's going head to head
[00:43:09.220 --> 00:43:11.500]   and everyone's making their money in different places.
[00:43:11.500 --> 00:43:15.260]   And yet they're all still right there
[00:43:15.260 --> 00:43:17.540]   at the end of the day trying to get the same customer
[00:43:17.540 --> 00:43:19.140]   to do the same different things.
[00:43:19.140 --> 00:43:22.340]   So Apple, Amazon, Google, Microsoft,
[00:43:22.340 --> 00:43:23.340]   they're all in the fray.
[00:43:23.340 --> 00:43:26.380]   Now, Facebook actually is I think coming on fast
[00:43:26.380 --> 00:43:28.460]   in that category as well.
[00:43:28.460 --> 00:43:30.860]   >> In many ways it seems as though Amazon is the,
[00:43:30.860 --> 00:43:32.980]   not only they're very similar to Apple
[00:43:32.980 --> 00:43:34.940]   in that they've spent so much time
[00:43:34.940 --> 00:43:37.100]   pretty inventing not just hardware,
[00:43:37.100 --> 00:43:38.540]   but also an infrastructure around it
[00:43:38.540 --> 00:43:40.260]   and an ecosystem around it.
[00:43:40.260 --> 00:43:43.180]   But in some ways they're actually the complete opposite
[00:43:43.180 --> 00:43:46.740]   of Apple in that Apple is willing to not really make
[00:43:46.740 --> 00:43:48.700]   much money on their software services
[00:43:48.700 --> 00:43:50.500]   as long as they can make huge, huge profits,
[00:43:50.500 --> 00:43:52.020]   markups on their hardware.
[00:43:52.020 --> 00:43:54.460]   Amazon for every teardown that's been done
[00:43:54.460 --> 00:43:57.980]   on the Kindle Fire tablet has that they are barely breaking
[00:43:57.980 --> 00:44:00.020]   even if not losing a couple of dollars
[00:44:00.020 --> 00:44:02.100]   on each one of these $199 tablets.
[00:44:02.100 --> 00:44:06.900]   And clearly Amazon's plan is to take a small loss
[00:44:06.900 --> 00:44:09.820]   in the hardware, give away the razors
[00:44:09.820 --> 00:44:13.180]   and make profit on the blades and all the software.
[00:44:13.180 --> 00:44:14.740]   The fire has been out long enough now
[00:44:14.740 --> 00:44:17.540]   that the usual analysts that have their usual reports
[00:44:17.540 --> 00:44:20.140]   to assure the usual people that they know
[00:44:20.140 --> 00:44:21.700]   what they're talking about when it comes to analyze
[00:44:21.700 --> 00:44:23.940]   the tablet industry are coming up with their reports
[00:44:23.940 --> 00:44:25.980]   and analysis of the Kindle Fire.
[00:44:25.980 --> 00:44:29.820]   The consensus seems to be that the Kindle Fire
[00:44:29.820 --> 00:44:31.340]   is actually gonna help the iPad.
[00:44:31.340 --> 00:44:32.340]   We have a report.
[00:44:32.340 --> 00:44:34.260]   I think it was from JP Morgan,
[00:44:34.260 --> 00:44:36.460]   I'm afraid that my note here is a little bit sloppy,
[00:44:36.460 --> 00:44:40.900]   but the money quote was that Apple will continue
[00:44:40.900 --> 00:44:44.380]   to skim the cream off the top of the tablet market.
[00:44:44.380 --> 00:44:47.500]   Well, they'll always get the high profit, high margin device
[00:44:47.500 --> 00:44:49.140]   for people who have 500 bucks to spend
[00:44:49.140 --> 00:44:50.500]   or want a premium product.
[00:44:50.500 --> 00:44:53.100]   Amazon is going to take pretty much everybody else,
[00:44:53.100 --> 00:44:54.980]   people who are on a budget or don't have
[00:44:54.980 --> 00:44:57.580]   the greatest expectations out of a tablet.
[00:44:57.580 --> 00:45:00.420]   And that essentially this totally upends
[00:45:00.420 --> 00:45:01.620]   the rest of the Android market
[00:45:01.620 --> 00:45:04.140]   'cause there's just no room for anybody to squeeze.
[00:45:04.140 --> 00:45:07.140]   One is saying that from Evercore Partners,
[00:45:07.140 --> 00:45:08.980]   a guy named Robert Sears predicting that fire
[00:45:08.980 --> 00:45:12.260]   will have half of the entire Android tablet market by 2010.
[00:45:12.260 --> 00:45:15.540]   That could be more than 400 tablets by the way.
[00:45:15.540 --> 00:45:16.980]   No, just kidding.
[00:45:16.980 --> 00:45:19.420]   It seems as though they're on track too.
[00:45:19.420 --> 00:45:22.620]   I believe Amazon has already said that
[00:45:22.620 --> 00:45:23.940]   they've exceeded their own expectations.
[00:45:23.940 --> 00:45:28.940]   They're still not issuing any actual numbers on sales,
[00:45:28.940 --> 00:45:33.140]   but that's pretty much Kindle's way, Amazon's way.
[00:45:33.140 --> 00:45:35.460]   There also, another analyst is saying that
[00:45:35.460 --> 00:45:38.780]   they've had their own conversations with Apple executives
[00:45:38.780 --> 00:45:41.300]   and that Apple, excuse me, according to his report,
[00:45:41.300 --> 00:45:42.900]   he believes that Apple is seeing things
[00:45:42.900 --> 00:45:45.900]   exactly the same way that Kindle is,
[00:45:45.900 --> 00:45:48.100]   the Kindle Fire is valuable to Apple
[00:45:48.100 --> 00:45:50.340]   as a disruptive force that keeps the rest
[00:45:50.340 --> 00:45:53.140]   of the Android tablet market completely off balance.
[00:45:53.140 --> 00:45:57.260]   So I guess it's the classic definition
[00:45:57.260 --> 00:46:00.060]   of keeping your friends close and your enemies even closer.
[00:46:00.060 --> 00:46:03.620]   How many of us actually have fire tablets
[00:46:03.620 --> 00:46:05.060]   or known who has one yet?
[00:46:05.060 --> 00:46:06.580]   - I do.
[00:46:06.580 --> 00:46:08.660]   - I have one. - We had to get, yeah.
[00:46:08.660 --> 00:46:10.540]   - I don't. - It was interesting.
[00:46:10.540 --> 00:46:12.140]   - Don't you don't have one?
[00:46:12.140 --> 00:46:13.140]   - Don't get them in the UK yet.
[00:46:13.140 --> 00:46:13.980]   They're still not on the internet.
[00:46:13.980 --> 00:46:14.900]   - Yeah, that's right.
[00:46:14.900 --> 00:46:15.820]   Yeah, just the, yeah.
[00:46:15.820 --> 00:46:17.220]   - The, the, the things I thought about it.
[00:46:17.220 --> 00:46:18.060]   - I'm surprised.
[00:46:18.060 --> 00:46:19.140]   You should have flown out here and bought one
[00:46:19.140 --> 00:46:20.940]   just so you can do a screencast about it.
[00:46:20.940 --> 00:46:21.860]   (laughing)
[00:46:21.860 --> 00:46:23.220]   It's like, it's like, you're,
[00:46:23.220 --> 00:46:24.060]   - Oh, you're fast.
[00:46:24.060 --> 00:46:26.100]   - Every time, 'cause you're so prolific
[00:46:26.100 --> 00:46:28.780]   in doing such great screencast videos about everything,
[00:46:28.780 --> 00:46:30.540]   every time there's a product that like,
[00:46:30.540 --> 00:46:31.780]   you haven't done a screencast.
[00:46:31.780 --> 00:46:35.260]   I must be like watching like a big bin loaded with money
[00:46:35.260 --> 00:46:36.980]   on a conveyor belt, you just have to sort of watch it
[00:46:36.980 --> 00:46:38.700]   like pass you by at the airport.
[00:46:38.700 --> 00:46:39.540]   - Yeah, let's kill him.
[00:46:39.540 --> 00:46:41.020]   - We still haven't got iTunes match.
[00:46:41.020 --> 00:46:42.540]   So, you know, that's killing me now.
[00:46:42.540 --> 00:46:43.620]   And I've been asked several times,
[00:46:43.620 --> 00:46:45.500]   when's the screencast for iTunes match coming out?
[00:46:45.500 --> 00:46:47.660]   And unfortunately, until they roll it out to the UK,
[00:46:47.660 --> 00:46:49.820]   I can't really do it unless I do sort of come over
[00:46:49.820 --> 00:46:51.940]   for a weekend and do a quick screencast over there.
[00:46:51.940 --> 00:46:54.580]   But no, we're still waiting on the fire.
[00:46:54.580 --> 00:46:57.020]   It didn't quite tempt me enough to jump across the pond
[00:46:57.020 --> 00:46:58.660]   to get one I must admit.
[00:46:58.660 --> 00:46:59.660]   - Oh, well, okay.
[00:46:59.660 --> 00:47:02.460]   Adam, what, so what are you even thinking about it?
[00:47:02.460 --> 00:47:03.980]   - Well, I mean, first of all, you know,
[00:47:03.980 --> 00:47:05.980]   it's, it's really interesting because you kind of look at it
[00:47:05.980 --> 00:47:07.580]   and you're like, how do I turn the silly thing on?
[00:47:07.580 --> 00:47:08.280]   And there's a stye-
[00:47:08.280 --> 00:47:09.120]   - Anything in the forest.
[00:47:09.120 --> 00:47:10.680]   - I'm a corner here.
[00:47:10.680 --> 00:47:12.820]   But the thing that I find the most interesting
[00:47:12.820 --> 00:47:14.460]   is trying to get into the picture too.
[00:47:14.460 --> 00:47:15.620]   There we go.
[00:47:15.620 --> 00:47:17.620]   I'm in trouble with the reverses.
[00:47:17.620 --> 00:47:19.380]   Any event, the thing to find interesting about it,
[00:47:19.380 --> 00:47:20.860]   I was just talking with someone today
[00:47:20.860 --> 00:47:23.420]   who puts a lot of thought into e-readers
[00:47:23.420 --> 00:47:25.420]   and iPads and tablets and whatnot.
[00:47:25.420 --> 00:47:29.020]   And he was saying, you know, what about the question of,
[00:47:29.020 --> 00:47:31.780]   do you need an iPhone, an iPad, a laptop,
[00:47:31.780 --> 00:47:33.620]   and a Fakimple fire?
[00:47:33.620 --> 00:47:36.500]   And I was like, you know, the only two things
[00:47:36.500 --> 00:47:41.320]   that I can see the Kindle fire as doing exclusively
[00:47:41.320 --> 00:47:44.400]   are the Amazon Instant Video,
[00:47:44.400 --> 00:47:46.360]   Amazon Prime based Instant Videos,
[00:47:46.360 --> 00:47:48.360]   and the free book loaning.
[00:47:48.360 --> 00:47:50.800]   That everything else that Amazon does,
[00:47:50.800 --> 00:47:52.720]   you can get in the Kindle app.
[00:47:52.720 --> 00:47:56.400]   And, you know, and for the most part,
[00:47:56.400 --> 00:47:58.000]   if you can do Amazon Instant Video,
[00:47:58.000 --> 00:47:59.360]   you can do Netflix on the iPad.
[00:47:59.360 --> 00:48:01.680]   You're not getting a huge amount of difference there.
[00:48:01.680 --> 00:48:05.080]   So it was an interesting thought process.
[00:48:05.080 --> 00:48:08.740]   It was like, no, I can see why you might want an eye fire
[00:48:08.740 --> 00:48:11.780]   as well if you really like the form factor or whatnot.
[00:48:11.780 --> 00:48:14.340]   But if you were traveling, it'd leave the fire home.
[00:48:14.340 --> 00:48:15.660]   I mean, why would you bother?
[00:48:15.660 --> 00:48:17.900]   It's just not gonna do anything for,
[00:48:17.900 --> 00:48:20.060]   would it extra weight, the extra, you know,
[00:48:20.060 --> 00:48:22.300]   battery charger, you know, all of those things
[00:48:22.300 --> 00:48:24.420]   that you have to put up with to bring more technology.
[00:48:24.420 --> 00:48:27.420]   So, you know, I don't think it's a bad device,
[00:48:27.420 --> 00:48:31.420]   but I find it honestly a little uninspired.
[00:48:31.420 --> 00:48:32.620]   It does some things well.
[00:48:32.620 --> 00:48:34.380]   It's very good for its media,
[00:48:34.380 --> 00:48:37.260]   but it, you know, I don't grab it
[00:48:37.260 --> 00:48:39.060]   when I'm thinking about doing anything the way
[00:48:39.060 --> 00:48:41.580]   I do think of grab the iPad or the iPhone.
[00:48:41.580 --> 00:48:42.420]   - Hmm.
[00:48:42.420 --> 00:48:44.920]   Chris, what have your experience been?
[00:48:44.920 --> 00:48:47.340]   - I use it for reading quite a bit.
[00:48:47.340 --> 00:48:49.380]   And I think this is one of these devices.
[00:48:49.380 --> 00:48:51.720]   You try to think how many different ways
[00:48:51.720 --> 00:48:55.540]   can you squeeze a device into a certain pocket
[00:48:55.540 --> 00:48:57.540]   where as before we had the iPhone
[00:48:57.540 --> 00:48:59.340]   and then we had a laptop.
[00:48:59.340 --> 00:49:01.980]   You think, well, do I really need a middle device?
[00:49:01.980 --> 00:49:04.500]   - Oh, yeah, the iPad ends up working that way.
[00:49:04.500 --> 00:49:06.940]   So now I've squeezed it down even more.
[00:49:06.940 --> 00:49:09.580]   So now I've got my iPhone, I've got my iPad,
[00:49:09.580 --> 00:49:11.100]   and now I have my Kindle Fire.
[00:49:11.100 --> 00:49:13.420]   And so I use the Kindle Fire for reading
[00:49:13.420 --> 00:49:15.740]   because I have, I also got a Kindle touch
[00:49:15.740 --> 00:49:17.620]   to see what that experience was like.
[00:49:17.620 --> 00:49:19.940]   And I have to say, I'm not a big fan of E-ink
[00:49:19.940 --> 00:49:21.980]   and largely because it's not backlit.
[00:49:21.980 --> 00:49:23.420]   And I know a lot of people love that,
[00:49:23.420 --> 00:49:25.380]   but I don't read outdoors very often
[00:49:25.380 --> 00:49:27.380]   and the lighting here isn't always good.
[00:49:27.380 --> 00:49:29.740]   So I find it difficult to read
[00:49:29.740 --> 00:49:31.180]   unless I have that direct light
[00:49:31.180 --> 00:49:33.740]   or I have a book light on it.
[00:49:33.740 --> 00:49:36.540]   And it's awfully reflective on the touch.
[00:49:36.540 --> 00:49:38.660]   So I find this is good because,
[00:49:38.660 --> 00:49:40.460]   and this may be just the dumbest reason
[00:49:40.460 --> 00:49:41.780]   it's spent 200 bucks.
[00:49:41.780 --> 00:49:45.060]   But I find this thing too heavy
[00:49:45.060 --> 00:49:47.540]   to read for a couple of hours in bed.
[00:49:47.540 --> 00:49:50.780]   And so you have to hold it with two hands.
[00:49:50.780 --> 00:49:52.100]   If you try to do it with one hand,
[00:49:52.100 --> 00:49:54.620]   then your risk gets sore and that's no good.
[00:49:54.620 --> 00:49:57.020]   And it's, books look great on this thing,
[00:49:57.020 --> 00:50:00.700]   but for some reason, I think it's worth 200 bucks
[00:50:00.700 --> 00:50:02.460]   to be able to hold this thing.
[00:50:02.460 --> 00:50:05.780]   In one hand, have a nice backlit display.
[00:50:05.780 --> 00:50:06.980]   Okay, I don't want to take it outside
[00:50:06.980 --> 00:50:07.860]   because it's too reflective.
[00:50:07.860 --> 00:50:09.860]   But inside where I do the majority of my reading,
[00:50:09.860 --> 00:50:10.900]   it's great.
[00:50:10.900 --> 00:50:13.380]   I do like the video streaming on it.
[00:50:13.380 --> 00:50:15.540]   I kind of like it for all the reasons
[00:50:15.540 --> 00:50:18.780]   that Amazon calls it a Kindle,
[00:50:18.780 --> 00:50:20.340]   for all the media reasons.
[00:50:20.340 --> 00:50:23.180]   Where I don't like it is when I try to treat it like an iPad
[00:50:23.180 --> 00:50:26.340]   and I find it slow, unresponsive, I tap things
[00:50:26.340 --> 00:50:28.500]   and they don't respond the way I want.
[00:50:28.500 --> 00:50:29.620]   And the screen size.
[00:50:29.620 --> 00:50:34.220]   So Andy, you and I talked about comic apps for this on Twitter
[00:50:34.220 --> 00:50:36.740]   and I finally got the one that you recommended,
[00:50:36.740 --> 00:50:38.220]   which was copycat, I think.
[00:50:38.220 --> 00:50:41.340]   And I find that screen size too small for comics.
[00:50:41.340 --> 00:50:44.380]   I have to scroll around like six times on a page
[00:50:44.380 --> 00:50:45.700]   to see what's going on.
[00:50:45.700 --> 00:50:48.620]   Whereas on this device, I only have to scroll twice.
[00:50:48.620 --> 00:50:50.060]   I can see the top of the page.
[00:50:50.060 --> 00:50:51.260]   I can see the bottom of the page.
[00:50:51.260 --> 00:50:53.740]   If it's a two page spread, I can easily move back
[00:50:53.740 --> 00:50:55.140]   and forth between the two of them.
[00:50:55.140 --> 00:50:56.820]   So as a media reader, I think it's great.
[00:50:56.820 --> 00:50:59.460]   As a tablet, not so much.
[00:50:59.460 --> 00:51:04.340]   It really just point out the importance of media companies
[00:51:04.340 --> 00:51:07.180]   and having to restructure all of their content for these devices.
[00:51:07.180 --> 00:51:09.660]   One of the things I liked the least about the fire,
[00:51:09.660 --> 00:51:11.500]   and this is one of the most negative parts,
[00:51:11.500 --> 00:51:13.980]   my review of it, was that they gave me,
[00:51:13.980 --> 00:51:18.660]   this was, these were magazines that Amazon had handpicked,
[00:51:18.660 --> 00:51:20.540]   supposedly because they thought they would show off
[00:51:20.540 --> 00:51:23.100]   the fire in the best possible light.
[00:51:23.100 --> 00:51:26.340]   And so they gave me certain Condi-Nas publications,
[00:51:26.340 --> 00:51:30.020]   magazines to read that were preloaded on the fire.
[00:51:30.020 --> 00:51:33.980]   And they're all just like PDFs, like hard encoded PDFs
[00:51:33.980 --> 00:51:35.780]   that I would have to zoom and scroll around
[00:51:35.780 --> 00:51:37.580]   and pinch and stretch.
[00:51:37.580 --> 00:51:40.300]   And this is on a device that's not necessarily terrible.
[00:51:40.300 --> 00:51:42.460]   It's not, you wouldn't call it liquid fast
[00:51:42.460 --> 00:51:45.420]   at scrolling and pinching and zooming.
[00:51:45.420 --> 00:51:48.180]   Then about a week later, Barnes & Noble came out
[00:51:48.180 --> 00:51:51.420]   with their Nook tablet, which feels a lot zippy.
[00:51:51.420 --> 00:51:53.700]   I can't tell, I can't say whether the processor's
[00:51:53.700 --> 00:51:55.540]   actually faster or what the clock speed is,
[00:51:55.540 --> 00:51:57.220]   but it certainly feels a lot faster.
[00:51:57.220 --> 00:52:00.260]   But the magazines that, not only the ones that they gave me,
[00:52:00.260 --> 00:52:04.140]   but the ones that I bought, looked for and bought it my own,
[00:52:04.140 --> 00:52:05.340]   they have been completely reformatted.
[00:52:05.340 --> 00:52:06.780]   You get a version of People magazine
[00:52:06.780 --> 00:52:08.780]   that's been reformatted for seven inch screens,
[00:52:08.780 --> 00:52:10.700]   and you have to do this, for, excuse me,
[00:52:10.700 --> 00:52:12.100]   the publishers have to do this really,
[00:52:12.100 --> 00:52:14.420]   for every piece of content they wanna move on to this.
[00:52:14.420 --> 00:52:16.260]   I think that one of the reasons why the fire
[00:52:16.260 --> 00:52:19.540]   has been dinged so correctly on its periodicals
[00:52:19.540 --> 00:52:21.620]   and its newspapers is because it's almost a painful
[00:52:21.620 --> 00:52:22.980]   experience on a seven inch screen.
[00:52:22.980 --> 00:52:25.260]   So in that sense, when Steve Jobs was talking
[00:52:25.260 --> 00:52:27.860]   about how, oh no, seven inch, do we try to settle in tablets?
[00:52:27.860 --> 00:52:29.100]   They don't work, they're terrible,
[00:52:29.100 --> 00:52:31.060]   they're useless for some sort of media.
[00:52:31.060 --> 00:52:34.060]   If people don't adjust them, that's exactly right.
[00:52:34.060 --> 00:52:35.380]   Adam, you're about to say.
[00:52:35.380 --> 00:52:36.540]   - One thing I was gonna say, Andy,
[00:52:36.540 --> 00:52:38.980]   in response to Chris's comment,
[00:52:38.980 --> 00:52:41.820]   I agree with the problem with, you know,
[00:52:41.820 --> 00:52:43.460]   sort of holding the iPad in bed.
[00:52:43.460 --> 00:52:47.140]   What I've discovered is that I have this zero chroma case
[00:52:47.140 --> 00:52:50.820]   that I had my iPad is in, and it just has this nice little
[00:52:50.820 --> 00:52:54.100]   pop out, gosh, Tardi getting things into the picture here,
[00:52:54.100 --> 00:52:56.380]   nice pop out stand, and I actually,
[00:52:56.380 --> 00:52:58.780]   when I was testing the Kindle Fire,
[00:52:58.780 --> 00:53:00.780]   I was watching video on it, but in fact,
[00:53:00.780 --> 00:53:04.620]   I tend to watch video being a high energy person
[00:53:04.620 --> 00:53:06.780]   while I'm stretching or working out or something like that,
[00:53:06.780 --> 00:53:08.860]   and I find that the combination of the iPad
[00:53:08.860 --> 00:53:11.020]   and the zero chroma case so that I can actually pick it up
[00:53:11.020 --> 00:53:13.860]   and move it around as I turn over to do a different stretch
[00:53:13.860 --> 00:53:16.460]   or a different exercise or something like that
[00:53:16.460 --> 00:53:17.580]   to be really useful.
[00:53:17.580 --> 00:53:19.300]   I tried it on the Kindle Fire and it was tremendously
[00:53:19.300 --> 00:53:20.940]   frustrating because I kept having to try to find
[00:53:20.940 --> 00:53:22.500]   something to lead it on.
[00:53:22.500 --> 00:53:24.700]   And so in bed, same thing, you know,
[00:53:24.700 --> 00:53:27.180]   that it's constantly sliding around and everything,
[00:53:27.180 --> 00:53:29.540]   whereas the nice having the nice stand on the iPad
[00:53:29.540 --> 00:53:32.940]   holds it in place right where I want to be able to look.
[00:53:32.940 --> 00:53:34.620]   - Yeah, I have to say that with the iPad,
[00:53:34.620 --> 00:53:36.980]   I mean, I do read on the iPad in bed,
[00:53:36.980 --> 00:53:38.540]   and what I tend to do is just use the,
[00:53:38.540 --> 00:53:40.300]   just the standard smart cover,
[00:53:40.300 --> 00:53:42.620]   fold it down into its triangular formation,
[00:53:42.620 --> 00:53:43.860]   and then just plunk it on my chest,
[00:53:43.860 --> 00:53:45.420]   and that's fine 'cause I sort of, you know,
[00:53:45.420 --> 00:53:46.580]   I'm not sort of sitting up reading,
[00:53:46.580 --> 00:53:48.220]   I'm sort of laying down sort of half propped up,
[00:53:48.220 --> 00:53:49.820]   and that seems to be okay.
[00:53:49.820 --> 00:53:53.340]   I noticed there's a new Kickstarter project,
[00:53:53.340 --> 00:53:54.580]   actually there's two Kickstarter projects
[00:53:54.580 --> 00:53:55.420]   which you're investing.
[00:53:55.420 --> 00:53:57.900]   One is a docking station for the MacBook Air,
[00:53:57.900 --> 00:53:59.860]   which looks fantastic, perhaps we'll talk about that later,
[00:53:59.860 --> 00:54:02.620]   but there's also a long stand.
[00:54:02.620 --> 00:54:04.020]   This, I can't remember what it's called now,
[00:54:04.020 --> 00:54:04.860]   and I haven't actually got the next project.
[00:54:04.860 --> 00:54:09.100]   - Yeah, I'm looking for it myself 'cause I tweeted about it.
[00:54:09.100 --> 00:54:10.980]   - It looks really good 'cause it's a stand
[00:54:10.980 --> 00:54:11.900]   that you can drag around with you,
[00:54:11.900 --> 00:54:13.980]   but basically the idea is that you have your iPad
[00:54:13.980 --> 00:54:17.620]   completely hands free, so it's sort of a long-slander stand
[00:54:17.620 --> 00:54:20.260]   with like a three-foot arm that you can actually move backwards
[00:54:20.260 --> 00:54:22.700]   and forwards to, you know, sort of position your iPad
[00:54:22.700 --> 00:54:24.500]   in front of you and then bend it round.
[00:54:24.500 --> 00:54:26.220]   It does look a little bit too big, I have to say,
[00:54:26.220 --> 00:54:29.820]   and it's not cheap, but it does bring you a solution
[00:54:29.820 --> 00:54:31.980]   for hands free for the iPad.
[00:54:31.980 --> 00:54:33.780]   - Ah, yeah, I wish I could find it
[00:54:33.780 --> 00:54:36.140]   in my Twitter feed right now, but yeah, there is a,
[00:54:36.140 --> 00:54:38.260]   it's, I think it's called the sale
[00:54:38.260 --> 00:54:42.020]   or some clever spelling of it, S-E-A,
[00:54:42.020 --> 00:54:43.980]   it's some oldie-worldy sort of spelling of it.
[00:54:43.980 --> 00:54:46.140]   It actually looks like the,
[00:54:46.140 --> 00:54:50.300]   it looks like the yard arm of a sale of a scoon or something
[00:54:50.300 --> 00:54:53.380]   where when it's on your bedroom wall,
[00:54:53.380 --> 00:54:56.220]   it just simply folds flat, you drop this pole down,
[00:54:56.220 --> 00:55:00.060]   it brings down this like cord that's like a lead,
[00:55:00.060 --> 00:55:04.420]   a lead, and also there's a sheet that looks like a sale
[00:55:04.420 --> 00:55:06.260]   that acts as a cradle for the iPad,
[00:55:06.260 --> 00:55:07.500]   so you can then just like lie back
[00:55:07.500 --> 00:55:10.020]   and have this thing hovering in front of your face,
[00:55:10.020 --> 00:55:11.980]   like some sort of kind of leaf expecting to have grapes
[00:55:11.980 --> 00:55:14.940]   drop into his mouth only, it's pages out of the book.
[00:55:14.940 --> 00:55:18.460]   I'm so, I really would like to recommend it.
[00:55:18.460 --> 00:55:20.540]   Maybe during the commercial, I'll search for it some more
[00:55:20.540 --> 00:55:24.980]   so I can give people the actual place to go get it.
[00:55:24.980 --> 00:55:27.460]   For now, let's move on to,
[00:55:27.460 --> 00:55:31.820]   now I think that should get credit for not inviting rumors
[00:55:31.820 --> 00:55:33.140]   with the next iPhone, it's going to be like,
[00:55:33.140 --> 00:55:33.980]   that was a hell of an opening,
[00:55:33.980 --> 00:55:35.820]   and my primary responsibilities as opposed
[00:55:35.820 --> 00:55:38.740]   is to create those new irrationally responsible rumors
[00:55:38.740 --> 00:55:40.740]   that give us things to talk about for the next four or five
[00:55:40.740 --> 00:55:44.660]   weeks, Apple TV is still the rumor that would not die,
[00:55:45.180 --> 00:55:48.580]   we don't need to go to another three hour discussion about,
[00:55:48.580 --> 00:55:49.940]   well, it doesn't make sense to me,
[00:55:49.940 --> 00:55:52.940]   why would they have a TV set instead of an Apple TV
[00:55:52.940 --> 00:55:54.780]   that cost $99?
[00:55:54.780 --> 00:55:56.900]   I have to admit that I kind of got turned around
[00:55:56.900 --> 00:56:01.020]   a little bit when I reminded myself on Amazon
[00:56:01.020 --> 00:56:03.740]   that there are actually lots and lots of TVs,
[00:56:03.740 --> 00:56:06.500]   55 inch TVs that sell for $1,500,
[00:56:06.500 --> 00:56:08.140]   it's not like that's like the premium,
[00:56:08.140 --> 00:56:09.540]   oh God, there's only one and you have to be,
[00:56:09.540 --> 00:56:12.260]   it's made out of solid gold and it's made out of dragon tears,
[00:56:12.260 --> 00:56:14.620]   solid solidified dragon tears for the remote.
[00:56:14.620 --> 00:56:18.580]   So I couldn't see Apple making a $800 TV,
[00:56:18.580 --> 00:56:21.380]   I could definitely see them making something that costs
[00:56:21.380 --> 00:56:23.340]   twice as much as I would ever comfortably spend
[00:56:23.340 --> 00:56:24.660]   on a similar appliance.
[00:56:24.660 --> 00:56:26.540]   So I became a little bit more of a convert,
[00:56:26.540 --> 00:56:29.860]   but there was another 55 inches actually prophetic
[00:56:29.860 --> 00:56:34.780]   because another site, smarthouse.com, the Australian site,
[00:56:34.780 --> 00:56:37.420]   sites a Japanese source that there's going to be a 55 inch
[00:56:37.420 --> 00:56:38.980]   model and it's going to be using,
[00:56:38.980 --> 00:56:42.580]   and for the sake of clarity, what could be termed
[00:56:42.580 --> 00:56:45.340]   an iPad three process or whatever the next generation
[00:56:45.340 --> 00:56:47.540]   after the iPad two is going to be.
[00:56:47.540 --> 00:56:52.860]   Do you think, given that Apple is indeed in the business
[00:56:52.860 --> 00:56:55.140]   of selling really expensive things at high markup,
[00:56:55.140 --> 00:56:57.940]   is it a little bit more credible if we think about them
[00:56:57.940 --> 00:56:59.740]   just selling the really expensive one
[00:56:59.740 --> 00:57:02.460]   and not trying to compete with people who want to replace
[00:57:02.460 --> 00:57:05.220]   something for the rec room or the baby room?
[00:57:05.220 --> 00:57:06.060]   Let's start with it.
[00:57:06.060 --> 00:57:06.900]   - Well, let's just take it.
[00:57:06.900 --> 00:57:08.380]   - Go ahead.
[00:57:08.380 --> 00:57:09.620]   - I was just going to say then it's--
[00:57:09.620 --> 00:57:11.100]   - The first goes to the bold.
[00:57:11.100 --> 00:57:15.100]   - We've got it. - Anytime you watch it.
[00:57:15.100 --> 00:57:15.940]   - Go ahead.
[00:57:15.940 --> 00:57:17.100]   (laughing)
[00:57:17.100 --> 00:57:17.940]   - Adam, go right ahead.
[00:57:17.940 --> 00:57:22.220]   - For those of us who have gone on the record,
[00:57:22.220 --> 00:57:24.580]   numerous times of saying they don't watch television much,
[00:57:24.580 --> 00:57:28.500]   we finally brought down and bought our first television
[00:57:28.500 --> 00:57:31.620]   last week or so since 1990.
[00:57:31.620 --> 00:57:35.780]   So we upgraded past the Sony Treneteron from 19 inch
[00:57:35.780 --> 00:57:36.900]   Sony Treneteron.
[00:57:36.900 --> 00:57:41.900]   And so it was fascinating seeing just how complicated it is
[00:57:41.900 --> 00:57:44.180]   to buy a TV.
[00:57:44.180 --> 00:57:47.620]   It's, you know, there's vast numbers of features,
[00:57:47.620 --> 00:57:51.700]   even within manufacturer, there's many different models.
[00:57:51.700 --> 00:57:55.220]   Prices are not bad, you know, that we actually,
[00:57:55.220 --> 00:57:58.260]   there was a, we got a 50 inch Panasonic plasma
[00:57:58.260 --> 00:58:03.060]   for about $800 and to go to the 55 inch was 1100.
[00:58:03.060 --> 00:58:05.500]   So, you know, there's a spot there
[00:58:05.500 --> 00:58:09.340]   which you could see Apple coming in at a higher price range.
[00:58:09.340 --> 00:58:13.020]   But what I could mostly see Apple doing is simplifying
[00:58:13.020 --> 00:58:16.420]   that all of these things, all the decisions involved
[00:58:16.420 --> 00:58:18.260]   are very, very complicated.
[00:58:18.260 --> 00:58:21.340]   And you have to decide between LCD and plasma.
[00:58:21.340 --> 00:58:23.460]   And then when you're in LCD, there's the whole LED
[00:58:23.460 --> 00:58:26.700]   versus kind of compact fluorescent backlit nonsense.
[00:58:26.700 --> 00:58:29.620]   And it just, you know, it's one of those things where
[00:58:29.620 --> 00:58:32.300]   I felt like I was kind of qualified to do this
[00:58:32.300 --> 00:58:34.740]   as a tech writer, but you know, I would not have wanted
[00:58:34.740 --> 00:58:37.220]   to see what someone who didn't have my background
[00:58:37.220 --> 00:58:39.940]   in hardware and electronics attempt to do it.
[00:58:39.940 --> 00:58:42.140]   And you know, you go over to AVS forum
[00:58:42.140 --> 00:58:44.300]   and spend an evening reading stuff
[00:58:44.300 --> 00:58:45.500]   and you know, your brain explodes.
[00:58:45.500 --> 00:58:49.700]   So, it's just, it's a crazy, crazy world.
[00:58:49.700 --> 00:58:52.300]   And, but what I, what I still found interesting is
[00:58:52.300 --> 00:58:54.220]   we got this Panasonic plasma, which, you know,
[00:58:54.220 --> 00:58:55.700]   it's an internet TV, it's almost impossible
[00:58:55.700 --> 00:58:56.980]   to get one that's not these days.
[00:58:56.980 --> 00:59:00.780]   I mean, I wanted a dumb monitor, but that's not available.
[00:59:00.780 --> 00:59:04.060]   And it does Amazon Instant Video,
[00:59:04.060 --> 00:59:10.740]   does Netflix, it does Hulu Plus, it does YouTube and, it's pretty good. You know, it's, you
[00:59:10.740 --> 00:59:16.320]   know, it's kind of clumsy entering anything with a 9 key remote is just horribly awful,
[00:59:16.320 --> 00:59:22.020]   but the fact of the matter is that it actually works pretty well. And once you get it networked
[00:59:22.020 --> 00:59:26.800]   in and we don't have any other input to it. We have no antenna, no cable, no nothing,
[00:59:26.800 --> 00:59:35.680]   no DVD player, no game box, no, no nothing. So it's just an internet TV and it works pretty
[00:59:35.680 --> 00:59:42.020]   well. So I actually could see Apple doing some of this sort of stuff now and coming in
[00:59:42.020 --> 00:59:50.080]   at that high end with, you know, the really cleanly designed, really simple to use system
[00:59:50.080 --> 00:59:52.080]   that would just work.
[00:59:52.080 --> 00:59:57.640]   Yeah, I was interesting. I don't remember who it was said it though, but the thing that
[00:59:57.640 --> 01:00:01.300]   sort of swayed me. I know we've got all these rumors and, you know, we've got the quotes
[01:00:01.300 --> 01:00:06.720]   in the book about Steve Jobs finally figuring out how to do Apple TV. But I think, and again,
[01:00:06.720 --> 01:00:10.480]   I can't quote my source. I can't remember who said it, but basically what they said
[01:00:10.480 --> 01:00:14.640]   is, but you know, Apple currently, most people have got an Apple TV, which is a great device
[01:00:14.640 --> 01:00:19.800]   and does give you access to lots of this functionality. But it's always relegated to, you know, port
[01:00:19.800 --> 01:00:25.280]   2 HDMI 2, it's a separate it and add on to the TV. Whereas Apple really with the sort
[01:00:25.280 --> 01:00:29.040]   of philosophy and the wanting to control the entire user's experience, they don't want
[01:00:29.040 --> 01:00:33.680]   the device to be on port 2. They want it to be on port 2. They want you to drop you into
[01:00:33.680 --> 01:00:37.680]   the Apple experience as soon as you switch the TV on. And at that point, I thought, well,
[01:00:37.680 --> 01:00:43.360]   actually, yeah, I can well imagine Apple wanting to do that. And, you know, I bought a TV,
[01:00:43.360 --> 01:00:48.200]   you know, six months ago, seven, eight months ago now. And it's a great TV. Pictures fine.
[01:00:48.200 --> 01:00:53.240]   But it's so clunky. You know, the actual operating system of the TV is horrible. When you actually
[01:00:53.240 --> 01:00:58.840]   get onto the TV, you know, it's you have to switch to something decent to, you know, to
[01:00:58.840 --> 01:01:03.760]   make it to make it work nice. And as for the built-in applications, you know, the implementation
[01:01:03.760 --> 01:01:08.120]   of YouTube and stuff like that, it's just awful. And so, yeah, I, you know, I agree
[01:01:08.120 --> 01:01:11.520]   with that. And I think, you know, it's it's it's ripe really for Apple to come in, simplify
[01:01:11.520 --> 01:01:16.160]   everything and give people the Apple experience from when they switch on the TV, not from
[01:01:16.160 --> 01:01:19.080]   when they switch on the TV, and then switch across to another port.
[01:01:19.080 --> 01:01:25.360]   Yeah, I finally got around to hooking up a boxy box for review. And I love it for the
[01:01:25.360 --> 01:01:30.160]   range of features that it brings. If you want to access the greatest variety of services
[01:01:30.160 --> 01:01:34.720]   and you don't want to hook up an actual computer, standalone windows or Mac computer to the
[01:01:34.720 --> 01:01:38.760]   to the screen, it's probably your best bet. But yeah, it's just I'll connect to my sling
[01:01:38.760 --> 01:01:43.440]   box, my cable connection upstairs. And it I'll get the picture, but no sound or the sound,
[01:01:43.440 --> 01:01:48.800]   but no picture. HBO Go app sometimes works sometimes doesn't. And that's just if if I
[01:01:48.800 --> 01:01:52.320]   had actually paid money for this, as opposed to getting a review unit for for for for a
[01:01:52.320 --> 01:01:56.600]   while to play with, I'd be pretty cheesed off. I maybe if all have all Apple has to do is
[01:01:56.600 --> 01:02:00.720]   make all this stuff really, really work. Or maybe a little bit to be snarky, make it work
[01:02:00.720 --> 01:02:05.720]   as well as it does on a $69 Roku box to actually make it work.
[01:02:05.720 --> 01:02:11.280]   It's got iOS. So it's got that on its side. Chris, what do you think?
[01:02:11.280 --> 01:02:15.680]   Yeah, I think that they have to do more. We think I'm sorry, we're assuming that's going
[01:02:15.680 --> 01:02:19.840]   to run iOS, what else would it run? Yeah, well, I do think that it has to be more than
[01:02:19.840 --> 01:02:24.240]   the simplicity of the TV. But I agree with everybody that setting up your TV is complicated.
[01:02:24.240 --> 01:02:30.160]   You particularly when you start adding AV units in there. But I think like Apple does,
[01:02:30.160 --> 01:02:35.480]   they have to fundamentally change how we think of this device, which is our television set.
[01:02:35.480 --> 01:02:40.800]   So one, it becomes an airplane device. So that you have your devices walking around
[01:02:40.800 --> 01:02:45.640]   with your iPhone or your iPad and you immediately have contact with your television and you don't
[01:02:45.640 --> 01:02:52.440]   have to set up anything complicated. Just bang, go to the TV. Yes, it does. Content,
[01:02:52.440 --> 01:02:58.200]   well, applications is the next thing, that it becomes a real live iOS device. Yes, there
[01:02:58.200 --> 01:03:02.040]   are things like on the new Roku box, you can put games on there and you can play Angry
[01:03:02.040 --> 01:03:06.800]   Birds with kind of this clumsy controller. Well, that's got to go. So instead you have
[01:03:06.800 --> 01:03:12.720]   real apps, you could put real games on there that you can control with your iOS devices.
[01:03:12.720 --> 01:03:19.240]   And then there's content and that's going to be the tricky part because unlike in the
[01:03:19.240 --> 01:03:23.880]   music industry where they were desperate and they needed that lifeline that Apple threw
[01:03:23.880 --> 01:03:31.920]   them, the movie companies and the TV studios and the carriers do not want Apple to succeed,
[01:03:31.920 --> 01:03:36.600]   particularly the carriers. Comcast does not want people to have a la carte viewing because
[01:03:36.600 --> 01:03:40.800]   then they can't sell you these overpriced plans to have 1000 stations that you never
[01:03:40.800 --> 01:03:46.320]   watch. What ideally Apple would do is provide us with what many of us have wanted for a
[01:03:46.320 --> 01:03:53.160]   long time, which is that a la carte experience where we don't have to have Comcast or Dish
[01:03:53.160 --> 01:03:58.520]   or Direct TV. But rather, we have the seven channels that we watch routinely because we
[01:03:58.520 --> 01:04:03.440]   want live sports and news. But we also want to be able to have a Hulu-like experience
[01:04:03.440 --> 01:04:08.160]   without the commercials where we can just access the content that we want. That would
[01:04:08.160 --> 01:04:14.420]   change the way we consume media. But I think there are too many very powerful forces behind
[01:04:14.420 --> 01:04:18.760]   it to allow that to happen. So I think content is going to still be a stumbling block for
[01:04:18.760 --> 01:04:19.760]   Apple.
[01:04:19.760 --> 01:04:23.520]   Yeah, I mean, what's good to box with the physical empty box with anything really entertaining
[01:04:23.520 --> 01:04:29.920]   or with any nudity to fill it with. And on that note, let's go back to our spokesperson,
[01:04:29.920 --> 01:04:34.680]   our beautiful spokesmodel, Leo Le Porte, with another message from our sponsor this time
[01:04:34.680 --> 01:04:37.280]   from Smile Software. Over to you, Leo.
[01:04:37.280 --> 01:04:43.640]   Can't be there with you guys this week. Hope you're watching and enjoying our coverage
[01:04:43.640 --> 01:04:47.440]   from Paris. I did want to talk a little bit about, you know, Andy, you could have done
[01:04:47.440 --> 01:04:53.400]   this act because I know you love this thing. I certainly do. I hope you use this text expander
[01:04:53.400 --> 01:04:59.440]   from Smile. You don't know about? Oh, you got a try text expander. It is amazing. I
[01:04:59.440 --> 01:05:04.680]   put it on. I just got a new error. And of course, the very first thing I install is text expander.
[01:05:04.680 --> 01:05:10.800]   Now you can get it on the website from Smile Software or you can get it in the App Store.
[01:05:10.800 --> 01:05:14.400]   And I actually, because I bought it on the App Store, I actually paid for it twice. I
[01:05:14.400 --> 01:05:18.480]   have it from, you know, I bought it from Smile Software. And then I do this all the time.
[01:05:18.480 --> 01:05:22.640]   The App Store, I thought, I'll be easy. Then I can update and everything. So it was already
[01:05:22.640 --> 01:05:27.440]   in my App Store. As soon as I got that new Air, I just said, install it and it's there
[01:05:27.440 --> 01:05:32.640]   and installed now. What does it do? Well, it basically saves you typing. It saves you
[01:05:32.640 --> 01:05:38.560]   a lot of typing. Anytime you've got repetitive things that you type, emails, signatures,
[01:05:38.560 --> 01:05:46.800]   addresses, standard paragraphs with text expander, you create the text or graphics snippet. By
[01:05:46.800 --> 01:05:51.360]   the way, you can do graphics too. Some people use a, have a graphic of their signature, for instance,
[01:05:51.360 --> 01:05:57.680]   and use that. And then you type an abbreviation. So for my signature, it's SSIG. It's not something
[01:05:57.680 --> 01:06:04.160]   I would type normally. But whenever I type SSIG in any text field on my computer, it fills it in.
[01:06:04.160 --> 01:06:09.920]   If it's a graphic, it pays the graphic in. Your snippets in the document. Now text expander has
[01:06:09.920 --> 01:06:13.600]   done that for years, but now in text expander three, they've added some nice new features.
[01:06:13.600 --> 01:06:21.120]   There are form fill snippets. So the snippet will pause and let you add, you know, fill in a blank.
[01:06:21.360 --> 01:06:26.000]   So if you want to customize it with a name or address or something, it'll just pause, wait for
[01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:30.960]   you, you type it in and then it continues on. You can now finally, I think this is really nice,
[01:06:30.960 --> 01:06:36.800]   use tab, return, enter, and escape keys in your snippet. That's something new. There's full support
[01:06:36.800 --> 01:06:41.920]   for AppleScript and shell script. Means this is very powerful. The script is running, the result
[01:06:41.920 --> 01:06:46.960]   is inserted. So you could do a calculation. You could, I mean, there's, I don't know, let's say,
[01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:52.160]   let's say you have an inventory system, you can have, you could be typing, oh, well, we only have
[01:06:52.160 --> 01:06:57.360]   X number left. You type, we only have X number left. And then when it fills it in, it will run
[01:06:57.360 --> 01:07:01.920]   a shell script or an Apple script that determines how much is left and stick it in there. That's
[01:07:01.920 --> 01:07:07.360]   just one example of it. Dropbox support, I've been using this for a while. So I have my snippets,
[01:07:07.360 --> 01:07:12.560]   not stored locally, but stored on Dropbox, so that I have my snippets everywhere, which is really
[01:07:12.560 --> 01:07:18.720]   handy. Also, hotkey options for quickly creating, editing, and finding snippets. I mean, I just go
[01:07:18.720 --> 01:07:23.520]   on and on. This product gets better all the time. It is fantastic. There's a free demo waiting for
[01:07:23.520 --> 01:07:33.760]   you. You go to smilesoftware.com/macbreak and you could try it free. It's $34.95, which is a
[01:07:33.760 --> 01:07:39.280]   great deal. And I'm telling you, well worth it. Smilesoftware.com/macbreak, try it free if you don't
[01:07:39.280 --> 01:07:44.080]   believe me. I would just go out and buy it. In fact, Don McAllister has a great screencast if you
[01:07:44.080 --> 01:07:49.520]   want to see it on the website smilesoftware.com. And he'll walk you through all the benefits.
[01:07:49.520 --> 01:07:53.760]   Merlin's done it too. Merlin, I maybe was Merlin who told me about text expanded first. He's got a
[01:07:53.760 --> 01:08:01.120]   great demo of the film function, the form-film functionality on his website kungfu grip.com.
[01:08:01.120 --> 01:08:08.320]   Then even everybody agrees. This is the product. One of the like the five every Mac owner must have.
[01:08:08.320 --> 01:08:16.240]   If you don't have it yet, smilesoftware.com/macbreak. Give it a try. Text Expander from smile. It'll make
[01:08:16.240 --> 01:08:22.800]   you smile. Now, speaking of smiling, here's Mr. Yooka Lele star himself and they are not go.
[01:08:22.800 --> 01:08:27.760]   I'm sorry. That's my stage name. And I told you that in confidence Leo.
[01:08:27.760 --> 01:08:34.640]   Yes. No, no, no, no. No wonder Don has a screencast about the text expander. I have a travel pack of
[01:08:34.640 --> 01:08:39.040]   Q-tips here. I bet you have a screencast about this as well. If it's translucent or
[01:08:39.040 --> 01:08:44.320]   anyway nifty, you've got a screencast about it. You are like smog. You cover the earth
[01:08:44.320 --> 01:08:48.800]   in screencast only in a positive way. We should have mentioned in the earlier
[01:08:48.800 --> 01:08:53.920]   story as well about the redacted PDF. I bet they didn't use PDF pen because that would
[01:08:53.920 --> 01:08:57.600]   have sorted it out properly for them because you that's another smile product and they have full
[01:08:57.600 --> 01:09:04.240]   reduction support in the PDF pen product. Here you go. All good stuff. We're going to get to
[01:09:04.240 --> 01:09:09.920]   our iOS tips and our Mac OS tips. But first a shout out for people in the New York metro area.
[01:09:09.920 --> 01:09:15.440]   The Grand Central Station Apple Store opens on Friday at 10 a.m. This is going to be the world's
[01:09:15.440 --> 01:09:23.680]   very largest Apple store at 23,000 square feet. The second largest is now 16.3,000 square feet at
[01:09:23.680 --> 01:09:27.120]   Covent Garden, which proves that the United States must be better than England if we have a larger
[01:09:27.120 --> 01:09:31.280]   Apple store because bigger things are better things. That's the American way of life. Look at our food
[01:09:31.280 --> 01:09:35.760]   portions. You would say that French food is better than American food because French portions are so
[01:09:35.760 --> 01:09:40.080]   tiny. Yes, they've got the whole top floor there where he failed restaurants once was.
[01:09:40.080 --> 01:09:45.680]   If you show up early enough, there's a good chance that Apple employees will applaud you.
[01:09:45.680 --> 01:09:50.800]   These tough times of desperation is good to have someone applaud you just for showing up and maybe
[01:09:50.800 --> 01:09:55.760]   buying something. They might get a free t-shirt if previous store openings are a lesson.
[01:09:56.560 --> 01:10:02.240]   It's not at coolness. 10 a.m. is just the special opening day for Friday. Normally,
[01:10:02.240 --> 01:10:05.760]   it's going to be open at 7 a.m. so it can catch all that commuter traffic coming in.
[01:10:05.760 --> 01:10:12.240]   It is not going to be open all night. It closes at 9 p.m. every day. So, you hobo's out there.
[01:10:12.240 --> 01:10:17.840]   Our out of luck. I'm not talking about our unfortunate homeless people. I'm talking about
[01:10:17.840 --> 01:10:21.920]   you hobo's out there who spend your entire day mooching free Wi-Fi wherever you can get it going
[01:10:21.920 --> 01:10:26.480]   from place to place to place. As Mitchapotley says, I'm sorry it's time to move on. You move on to
[01:10:26.480 --> 01:10:30.320]   the Panera. The Panera says you've had eight free refills this time to move on. Now you can go to
[01:10:30.320 --> 01:10:34.160]   the Apple store. But you have to get out of there by 9 p.m. at which point you're on your way to
[01:10:34.160 --> 01:10:40.160]   the Starbucks, I'm sure. Now, Adam, you live in New York state. So, I'm sure that you're really
[01:10:40.160 --> 01:10:45.360]   interested in this and that you're headed out there right now. It's what the technically,
[01:10:45.360 --> 01:10:54.480]   any converted, you're on like 8,031st Street on the MTA line. You know that famous New
[01:10:54.480 --> 01:11:01.280]   Yorker cartoon where it's Midtown and up in the Bronx and it works its way. I'm somewhere next
[01:11:01.280 --> 01:11:10.160]   to California. Five hours away. The other world. Well, I suppose, but you're still in the same state.
[01:11:10.160 --> 01:11:15.520]   I mean, that's got to count for something. New York's a big state. It's one of those things.
[01:11:15.520 --> 01:11:21.520]   You don't realize until you try to drive across it the long way and it takes a while. I mean,
[01:11:21.520 --> 01:11:24.160]   there's nothing, I'm not saying New York's the biggest state or anything like that, but
[01:11:24.160 --> 01:11:30.240]   it's not one of those states that you just sort of jaunt across, like say Rhode Island, where you
[01:11:30.240 --> 01:11:35.040]   couldn't miss it if you're not careful and paying attention. Well, most New England states, you
[01:11:35.040 --> 01:11:38.960]   could miss it if you were to fall asleep at the wheel, which is something that, well, actually,
[01:11:38.960 --> 01:11:42.240]   New Yorkers wouldn't do that because they have to stop to pee on something. But
[01:11:42.240 --> 01:11:47.760]   why would you want to, one, we have a welcome another new sponsor, the New England Tourism Board,
[01:11:47.760 --> 01:11:52.720]   why would you want to pass by such wonderful states as the Green Mountain State Vermont,
[01:11:52.720 --> 01:12:00.080]   the granite state, New Hampshire, Maine, Blueberry State, Boston, home of, we've had three sitcoms,
[01:12:00.080 --> 01:12:03.440]   two of them were successful. Don't matter the third one doesn't, not really our responsibility.
[01:12:04.080 --> 01:12:10.560]   But yeah, I think it is at, sorry, I look at what you're doing first.
[01:12:10.560 --> 01:12:12.720]   It is known as centrally isolated.
[01:12:12.720 --> 01:12:18.320]   Centrally isolated, yes. It's so convenient to all the other places that you would want to go if
[01:12:18.320 --> 01:12:23.600]   you want to get away from New York. We have to drive an hour in any direction to get to a freeway.
[01:12:23.600 --> 01:12:30.480]   Oh man, that's tough. So, well, on the other hand, if someone really wants to like argue with
[01:12:30.480 --> 01:12:35.040]   you in person, that's got, well, the good news is that they're probably not going to want to bother,
[01:12:35.040 --> 01:12:39.600]   the bad news is that if they want to bother, they're going to be really mad at you. They got
[01:12:39.600 --> 01:12:46.400]   a really, they're ready to punch you pretty hard. But it's, I was looking at the Grand Central,
[01:12:46.400 --> 01:12:52.240]   as usual, the entire area is draped off in black curtains. There is a couple of sneak photos
[01:12:52.240 --> 01:12:57.040]   have been taken of the genius bar that preserve. Obviously, they couldn't tear anything down and
[01:12:57.040 --> 01:13:01.280]   really do a whole lot of construction, considering it's a historic area. So, they've done things
[01:13:01.280 --> 01:13:07.120]   like hang glass panels in front of the the stonework to put all the really cool tech and all the cool
[01:13:07.120 --> 01:13:12.720]   logos on. So, I don't know if that's going to be as architectural league incredible as the
[01:13:12.720 --> 01:13:20.640]   giant glass cube is or the giant glass tube or the giant glass DNA helix that's planned for the
[01:13:20.640 --> 01:13:28.400]   33,000, 33,000 square foot Apple store destined for brainer, in what,
[01:13:28.400 --> 01:13:31.840]   2013, 2014, they always got to keep building them bigger and bigger.
[01:13:31.840 --> 01:13:39.680]   I just, it's cool they're making them larger. It's cool. They're putting in such a central location.
[01:13:39.680 --> 01:13:45.360]   I mean, if I were a daily commuter, I would, the good news is that I would be buying my, I have my
[01:13:45.360 --> 01:13:49.280]   iPhone and every time that it overheated and exploded in my pocket, at least I couldn't get
[01:13:49.280 --> 01:13:53.600]   my jacket fixed for the smoking holes that'd be patched up, but at least can get a new battery
[01:13:53.600 --> 01:13:57.680]   in that place. I don't know if it's going to really catch, I don't know, I don't know how
[01:13:57.680 --> 01:14:02.080]   excited people should be about it. I'm really curious to see how they're going to build,
[01:14:02.080 --> 01:14:06.720]   how they solved all those problems of building a really cool store in a space that's so significant
[01:14:06.720 --> 01:14:10.400]   where they're, you think that it's tough, you're at your first apartment, you can't hang a picture
[01:14:10.400 --> 01:14:15.200]   where you want. Imagine trying to create a place where you can put your 23 square foot
[01:14:15.760 --> 01:14:19.840]   giant interactive iPad when there's an arts commission. Already they're getting to trouble.
[01:14:19.840 --> 01:14:26.000]   New York Post was claiming that Apple got a sweetheart deal for the $800,000 a year rent on the space.
[01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:32.320]   The legislators who had a part of that deal were claiming that, oh, well, you know what,
[01:14:32.320 --> 01:14:36.080]   they also had to pay off $5 million to the previous tenant to get the space.
[01:14:36.080 --> 01:14:39.840]   And the people who were complaining were saying, yeah, but that money didn't actually go to the
[01:14:39.840 --> 01:14:47.520]   city, did it. So that's a good lawsuits come in threes and we've had our three lawsuits so far,
[01:14:47.520 --> 01:14:52.720]   three legal actions. And now we are ready to move unless anybody has any comments or questions
[01:14:52.720 --> 01:14:57.840]   or quips or anecdotes about hanging out in Grand Central Station and standing up for four hours
[01:14:57.840 --> 01:15:01.120]   just to get a free t-shirt and maybe a look at an iPad two that you've owned for three months.
[01:15:01.120 --> 01:15:04.080]   Nope, excellent. So let's go.
[01:15:05.600 --> 01:15:09.600]   Are they going to give up the little Apple train whistles or something as kind of your to go with
[01:15:09.600 --> 01:15:20.240]   your t-shirt? Yeah, and engineers cap. You should do that. You should be conductor Chris. Hello,
[01:15:20.240 --> 01:15:23.920]   I'm here to punch your ticket to new iOS understanding.
[01:15:23.920 --> 01:15:28.720]   Now that would be so cool. The potential of GarageBand on iOS.
[01:15:28.720 --> 01:15:33.680]   Exactly. We forget the whole orange t-shirt and the blue t-shirt thing. Put everybody in
[01:15:33.680 --> 01:15:39.840]   stripy overalls and the engineers cap and give them a little punchy thing. And that's how you
[01:15:39.840 --> 01:15:45.760]   check out instead of scanning through some app, just go in there with $20 bills and you just
[01:15:45.760 --> 01:15:49.200]   punch them and take them away from them and say, and here's your thing.
[01:15:49.200 --> 01:15:52.720]   That's a great idea because the one thing that's always been missing from the Apple Store
[01:15:52.720 --> 01:15:57.760]   experience are employees who wish they were dead. And if you force them to wear these embarrassing
[01:15:57.760 --> 01:16:03.040]   uniforms and force them to say, "Welcome to the Apple Store, Grand Central Station."
[01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:08.560]   Ooh, all aboard for great savings on holiday. Please kill me right now.
[01:16:08.560 --> 01:16:12.720]   I'll get on the phone with Ron Johnson right now and see if I can do that.
[01:16:12.720 --> 01:16:20.400]   So, since we have you on the line right now, conductor Chris, what is your iOS tip of the week?
[01:16:20.400 --> 01:16:25.040]   Okay, my iOS tip is and somebody goes out there.
[01:16:25.040 --> 01:16:31.040]   Go ahead. I'm doing the background because we're on the learning train. We're approach.
[01:16:31.040 --> 01:16:34.400]   We're not at the station of understanding it, but we're approaching it. We're getting faster.
[01:16:34.400 --> 01:16:38.240]   Okay. Okay, fine.
[01:16:38.240 --> 01:16:42.800]   So, you said you're going to play along with that. You said you're going to play along with
[01:16:42.800 --> 01:16:44.960]   that. You're not playing along with that. That's fine. That's fine.
[01:16:44.960 --> 01:16:46.160]   Okay. I'm fine.
[01:16:46.160 --> 01:16:48.080]   No, go ahead. Do the train.
[01:16:48.080 --> 01:16:53.840]   It's a good tip. I've read it. It's like I had one of those like dumb moments where I
[01:16:53.840 --> 01:16:56.720]   thought that if I were smarter, if I were a higher life former would have figured it out to
[01:16:56.720 --> 01:17:00.960]   this up myself, but I had not. So, it's going to be valuable. Mr. Richard is just not going to be
[01:17:00.960 --> 01:17:06.320]   enhanced by immersive sound effects. It would have sold it so much better. But if you think the idea
[01:17:06.320 --> 01:17:12.240]   is good enough in and of itself, if you want to take that responsibility onto yourself, Chris,
[01:17:12.240 --> 01:17:16.880]   you're a better man than I. So, by all means, everybody, here is the genius tip that doesn't
[01:17:16.880 --> 01:17:18.960]   need any enhancement whatsoever. We're all watching.
[01:17:18.960 --> 01:17:22.800]   Thanks. No pressure.
[01:17:22.800 --> 01:17:27.440]   Yeah, no pressure. And I mean, that's particularly bad because this to a lot of people, they're
[01:17:27.440 --> 01:17:34.640]   going to go, well, duh. But people will find this helpful idea because I didn't go, well, oh,
[01:17:34.640 --> 01:17:38.160]   well, of course, I should have thought of it. And I got this from Dan Frakes at McWorld. So,
[01:17:38.160 --> 01:17:43.360]   if you think it's stupid, you can email him and say, it's the dumbest tip I've ever heard.
[01:17:43.360 --> 01:17:48.240]   And the idea is that you know that you can create folders on these things.
[01:17:49.440 --> 01:17:54.880]   And when you do, it's so helpful that you have your folders full of applications. But oftentimes,
[01:17:54.880 --> 01:18:01.600]   what we end up doing is we'll drag it up over and we'll create a folder. And then when we do that,
[01:18:01.600 --> 01:18:08.320]   that's all wonderful. Except then what we do is we tend to swipe to another page and then we
[01:18:08.320 --> 01:18:13.040]   grab an app and then we drag it over here and we wait for the screen maybe to respond as it's
[01:18:13.040 --> 01:18:17.680]   supposed to. But most of the time it snaps back and you try again and please go over there and
[01:18:17.680 --> 01:18:21.760]   finally it moves and then you can drag it into your folder. But the folder keeps moving back
[01:18:21.760 --> 01:18:27.760]   and forth on the screen and you can't get to it. So here's the tip. Take your folder and put it down
[01:18:27.760 --> 01:18:35.840]   in the dock. And when you put it down in the dock, then you can switch all the screens you like and
[01:18:35.840 --> 01:18:40.720]   just simply drag them down into the folder. Add them to the folder that way. When you're finished
[01:18:40.720 --> 01:18:46.080]   with that folder, drag it out, create another folder, put it down in the dock, move between pages
[01:18:46.080 --> 01:18:52.080]   and drag your apps into the folder. And again, yes. Now, Chris, you sure you weren't reading
[01:18:52.080 --> 01:18:57.200]   Tanya's Take Control of Your iPad book because that tip is right in there. There might be some
[01:18:57.200 --> 01:19:02.320]   some tip plagiarism here going on. Wow. Well, you're going to have to talk to Dan Fraggs about
[01:19:02.320 --> 01:19:08.640]   that. But I admire the way you slip that plug in for your lives book. And I know you get a piece
[01:19:08.640 --> 01:19:12.240]   of this. So but, hey, I get more than a piece. That's my wife.
[01:19:13.280 --> 01:19:18.080]   Really? Well, that also happens to be in my new iPhone pocket guidebook from
[01:19:18.080 --> 01:19:20.480]   Pichka. I'll switch it. Highly affordable.
[01:19:20.480 --> 01:19:28.000]   Available at popular prices at gas stations everywhere. Don, you have you have a mecha was
[01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:32.560]   tipped for us today. Do I get any sound effects or? Yeah, exactly.
[01:19:36.960 --> 01:19:41.760]   All right. Mission control.
[01:19:41.760 --> 01:19:44.480]   Iron soothing sounds of the sea. No. Okay. Sorry. Go ahead.
[01:19:44.480 --> 01:19:51.280]   Tom will we might be. No, no, no. Mission control for line 10.7.2. With lion and
[01:19:51.280 --> 01:19:57.040]   with mission control, we now have these desktops or spaces that you can create just by moving
[01:19:57.040 --> 01:20:00.800]   your cursor up to the top right hand corner of the screen and in mission control, and you get a new
[01:20:00.800 --> 01:20:05.920]   desktop. Now, in the first version of lion, it was great, but you couldn't reorder them. So,
[01:20:06.480 --> 01:20:12.640]   wasn't too useful, but now with 10.7.2, you can actually reorder the arrangement of your
[01:20:12.640 --> 01:20:16.320]   spaces with a mission control and also your full screen apps as well. So that's good in
[01:20:16.320 --> 01:20:22.720]   itself, but you can also now create keyboard shortcuts to jump directly to desktops or spaces.
[01:20:22.720 --> 01:20:27.520]   And you do that through system preferences. Go into keyboard, go into keyboard shortcuts,
[01:20:27.520 --> 01:20:32.000]   and then under mission control, you'll see for every new desktop you create a mission control
[01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:36.960]   will be a switch to desktop and then a numeric. So if you create a new desktop, you get a new entry
[01:20:36.960 --> 01:20:42.000]   in there, just go in and you can add a sign a keyboard shortcut to that. And then you can just
[01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:46.080]   do control one control to control three and jump to all your different desktop spaces.
[01:20:46.080 --> 01:20:50.080]   You can't jump to full screen app, I don't think, but you can certainly jump to all the different
[01:20:50.080 --> 01:20:57.840]   desktops or spaces. Excellent. Now, we all have picks of the week lined up, I hope. If we do
[01:20:57.840 --> 01:21:02.000]   not have a pick of the week, you have probably above four or five minutes to line one up,
[01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:06.800]   because we have an ad from audible before we get to the picks of the week. And here we have to
[01:21:06.800 --> 01:21:12.960]   candid over to our spokesperson, Andy Nott go. Thanks, Andy, doing a hell of a job back there
[01:21:12.960 --> 01:21:17.760]   in the studio. Welcome to Paris, which I wasn't invited, even though the rest of the cool people
[01:21:17.760 --> 01:21:23.200]   from Twitter seem to be right there now, but that's okay. I have to, I've got some, I've got
[01:21:23.200 --> 01:21:28.000]   some sophisticated ad copy that I've now read in my professional voice. This episode of Mac
[01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:32.720]   Break, Mac Break Weekly is brought to you by audible.com. Audible.com is a leading provider of audio
[01:21:32.720 --> 01:21:38.240]   books with more than 100,000 downloadable titles across all types of literature, including fiction,
[01:21:38.240 --> 01:21:42.400]   nonfiction and periodicals for listeners of Mac Break Weekly. Audible is offering a free
[01:21:42.400 --> 01:21:47.760]   audiobook to give you a chance to try out their service. Will we, one audio book?
[01:21:48.720 --> 01:21:55.600]   Will we give you the URL for that as soon as I make my pick? Today's, my audible pick for today
[01:21:55.600 --> 01:22:04.240]   was something that I chose. Believe it or not, just this afternoon, because John Hodgman, as you know,
[01:22:04.240 --> 01:22:11.840]   is the, the formerly, I think he's, he's expunged his, his, his nomenclature as he is the, the American,
[01:22:11.840 --> 01:22:18.800]   I'm a Mac guy. He's, he's now a responsible commentator, daily show contributor and humorist and essayist
[01:22:18.800 --> 01:22:24.560]   in his own right. We need not associate him with the Mac anymore. He has a really great podcast
[01:22:24.560 --> 01:22:29.600]   called Judge John Hodgman, in which actual, just like people, it's just like the people's court only
[01:22:29.600 --> 01:22:35.840]   via Skype, where people who have a dispute of some kind can put it before Judge John Hodgman
[01:22:36.400 --> 01:22:43.280]   and live via Skype, that he will educate this and, and create his ruling. Today's ruling was a
[01:22:43.280 --> 01:22:48.000]   couple boyfriend and girlfriend. The boyfriend has a habit of rummaging through the trash,
[01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:52.800]   or the, the, the, the trash barrels at this local pizza place, where there's like some sort of
[01:22:52.800 --> 01:22:57.840]   in-store promotion where there's like a tear off on some of the pizza boxes have a free prize coupon
[01:22:57.840 --> 01:23:01.920]   attached. And sometimes people forget to look for them and they throw out a free slice, a coupon for
[01:23:01.920 --> 01:23:07.280]   free slice of pizza or whatever. And the guy says, well, it's free pizza. Why would I,
[01:23:07.280 --> 01:23:11.600]   where would I pass that up? The girl is actually quite horrified that his boy, her boyfriend is doing
[01:23:11.600 --> 01:23:16.400]   that right there in the, in the middle of a pizza place. Only the wisdom and the, the, and the
[01:23:16.400 --> 01:23:21.440]   legal acumen of Judge John Hodgman can do that. And so I was looking for a way to get more John
[01:23:21.440 --> 01:23:26.080]   Hodgman into my life without actually paying a speaking fee, which unfortunately is far beyond
[01:23:26.080 --> 01:23:32.720]   my means as a journalist. And so I wound up downloading more information than you require,
[01:23:32.720 --> 01:23:37.680]   which is his second book in his trilogy of almanacs of information about everything that you would
[01:23:37.680 --> 01:23:41.840]   ever want to know about everyone everywhere on all topics. Most, some of it is made up,
[01:23:41.840 --> 01:23:47.600]   but most of it is actually quite useful. And the cool thing about it is that it is read by John
[01:23:47.600 --> 01:23:53.680]   Hodgman, so you can't really go far wrong there. I just downloaded it like in the hour before,
[01:23:54.480 --> 01:23:58.320]   before we started recording, I listened to just the first like 20 minutes as I was setting up.
[01:23:58.320 --> 01:24:04.400]   And I'm like, yeah, this was, this was a good purchase. It's 12. I haven't for a while mentioned
[01:24:04.400 --> 01:24:11.040]   how long certain, certain selections are, I am, of course, a favor of, if you're using this as
[01:24:11.040 --> 01:24:17.280]   your free free download, the free download you get to keep even if you cancel your membership with
[01:24:17.280 --> 01:24:23.280]   audible. This is weighing it at 12 hours and 48 minutes. So it is a very, very good candidate
[01:24:23.280 --> 01:24:28.880]   if you're up to, if you really wanted to sort of stick it to the man, if you were to define the
[01:24:28.880 --> 01:24:31.680]   man as audible, even though they're being nice and giving you a free audiobook, I don't think
[01:24:31.680 --> 01:24:39.200]   that's quite appropriate at this time. And so that is thanks to audible. Thank you for sponsoring
[01:24:39.200 --> 01:24:44.800]   the show. Thank you for having a great service again. I blow through too many audiobooks in the
[01:24:44.800 --> 01:24:50.560]   course of a year. It actually makes me a lot of myself to try to bambooz my way into thinking,
[01:24:50.560 --> 01:24:54.240]   think people think they actually read more books than actually do. I don't actually read. Sometimes
[01:24:54.240 --> 01:24:59.760]   I'm just sort of doing the housework while listening to a cool book, all thanks to audible.com.
[01:24:59.760 --> 01:25:06.640]   And now let's move on to our picks of the week. I will reserve the last slot of the pick of the
[01:25:06.640 --> 01:25:11.600]   week for myself so that if any of you want to scoop me and steal my pick by all means, go ahead.
[01:25:11.600 --> 01:25:15.760]   That's part of the, that's part of the problem of being the host that we are the last. We always
[01:25:15.760 --> 01:25:21.280]   get the fuzzy under the lollipop. But let's start off with Chris. What is your pick this week?
[01:25:21.280 --> 01:25:29.440]   All right. This week I am offering to all of you a digital strip show in a way. And here is my
[01:25:29.440 --> 01:25:34.800]   here's my iPhone. Right. More sound effects. Okay. Not so interesting, but check out the back.
[01:25:39.520 --> 01:25:49.040]   It's see through UK. Sorry. Yes, you can see the guts. Here's the battery and here's stuff that
[01:25:49.040 --> 01:25:56.240]   does things with my phone. And this is my iPhone 4s. And this is thanks to I fix it and their $30
[01:25:56.240 --> 01:26:04.720]   iPhone 4s transparent back rear glass panel, 30 bucks. They go in and out of stock. So if you
[01:26:04.720 --> 01:26:08.720]   were in a dash over there right now, they might not be in stock. But I have talked to the people
[01:26:08.720 --> 01:26:13.680]   who run the joint and they say that indeed they're getting stock in every day. So if they're out,
[01:26:13.680 --> 01:26:21.520]   check back again and half a day or so. With it comes not only the panel in the back,
[01:26:21.520 --> 01:26:26.080]   but also two tools that you can use to take off the screws. Now Apple has changed the
[01:26:26.080 --> 01:26:32.160]   screw arrangement on these things so that they use a proprietary screw to put it to a fix the
[01:26:32.160 --> 01:26:37.360]   back panel to this. They include the two tools, the proprietary tool for getting the old screws out.
[01:26:37.360 --> 01:26:42.160]   And they give you nice Phillips head screws to put back in so that should you wish to get back in.
[01:26:42.160 --> 01:26:46.720]   And you've lost that tool. You can just take it out with a Phillips head screwdriver.
[01:26:46.720 --> 01:26:54.000]   It's sturdy. It's got the little lens thing for your camera. It's got the diffuser for the flash.
[01:26:54.000 --> 01:27:01.680]   It comes in models for both the four S as well as the iPhone 4. It's 30 bucks again.
[01:27:01.680 --> 01:27:06.560]   Not everybody in the world needs this, but I just think it's really cool to be able to look in and
[01:27:06.560 --> 01:27:12.320]   see the guts of my iPhone. Plus I gave my iPhone 4 to my wife. And when they were sitting next to
[01:27:12.320 --> 01:27:16.880]   each other on a table, I would have to take both of them and look side by side and go, "Now,
[01:27:16.880 --> 01:27:20.960]   where's that antenna line? Okay, this is my phone. I don't have that problem anymore. Now I just
[01:27:20.960 --> 01:27:24.960]   pick up the phone, look at it and go, "Ah, I see the guts. This is my phone." And that's my pick.
[01:27:24.960 --> 01:27:32.160]   Supa and Magical, two things we like to see with everything that we have in our iOS world.
[01:27:32.720 --> 01:27:37.840]   Adam, what's your pick of the week? Well, my pick of the week is not something anything new.
[01:27:37.840 --> 01:27:45.600]   In fact, it's for people who are in some ways of trying to avoid the new. It's Busymax BusyCal,
[01:27:45.600 --> 01:27:51.600]   which is the ICal replacement that does many things better than ICal. In fact, I think it may
[01:27:51.600 --> 01:27:56.640]   affect everything better than ICal. Keep in mind that I really, really hate ICal.
[01:27:57.600 --> 01:28:04.000]   And the thing that BusyCal does particularly well that causes me to give it as my pick of the week
[01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:10.560]   is that dirty little secret here, not all of my Macs are online. Some of them can't be upgraded.
[01:28:10.560 --> 01:28:15.680]   Some of them can't be upgraded past Leopard for that matter. And others of them, I just
[01:28:15.680 --> 01:28:19.360]   haven't gotten around to it. I'm a busy guy. I just can't do everything all at once.
[01:28:19.360 --> 01:28:25.360]   And yet, I wanted to move to iCloud and keep shared calendars. We get some household tension
[01:28:25.360 --> 01:28:30.240]   when the calendars stop being shared and conflicts start occurring. So in any event,
[01:28:30.240 --> 01:28:35.680]   I wanted to upgrade to iCloud and keep the calendar shared with Tanya who had upgraded her
[01:28:35.680 --> 01:28:41.120]   stuff to iCloud. And I was really worried that I wasn't going to be able to do that easily unless
[01:28:41.120 --> 01:28:48.320]   I could do some funkiness with BusyCal. And then I did the upgrade and BusyCal in Leopard and Snow
[01:28:48.320 --> 01:28:56.240]   Leopard just does iCloud. I should have realized this. It just builds in. It just works. It just
[01:28:56.240 --> 01:29:00.480]   picks it up. Nothing about iCloud just works. So that's quite an achievement if that's true.
[01:29:00.480 --> 01:29:06.400]   It does. It just works. I didn't even have to enter my credentials again, another one I had to go
[01:29:06.400 --> 01:29:12.080]   and sign into iCloud. But I was literally flabbergasted. I had to write this. I was sort of prepping to
[01:29:12.080 --> 01:29:16.240]   write this big long article about how I'd followed all the instructions in Joe's Take Control of iCloud
[01:29:16.240 --> 01:29:19.920]   in the BusyCal site and everything I could find. I'd friggy off this weird, happy way of getting
[01:29:19.920 --> 01:29:26.080]   it to work. And then it just worked on its own. So I wrote the article saying how it just worked
[01:29:26.080 --> 01:29:31.120]   when I was a little embarrassed. But kudos to BusyMac for making that possible. Now, if they would
[01:29:31.120 --> 01:29:35.200]   just get around to doing something to replace address book, I hate address book almost as much
[01:29:35.200 --> 01:29:40.880]   as I hate iCloud. Yeah, there's a certain gentrification that needs to occur deep, deep,
[01:29:40.880 --> 01:29:48.080]   deep in the corners of Mac OS at this point. Don, what's your pick? Well, I've got 42 applications.
[01:29:48.080 --> 01:29:52.720]   So if you've got time, I'll start off with the first one. No, I won't actually go through one.
[01:29:52.720 --> 01:29:57.040]   One by one. It's that season of the year again. Actually, I'm not sure they do this every year.
[01:29:57.040 --> 01:30:01.600]   I know in spring, we know all these bundles come out, but they've now decided to do winter bundles.
[01:30:01.600 --> 01:30:05.200]   So there are four bundles that I'm aware of. There's probably more. But some of them are really,
[01:30:05.200 --> 01:30:11.680]   really good. And basically, I'll just read out the four URLs. There's Maclegan.com. There's mupromo.com,
[01:30:11.680 --> 01:30:18.400]   productivemax.com, and also bundlehunt.com. Now, some great apps. And actually, if you check
[01:30:18.400 --> 01:30:23.120]   out it's productivemax.com, you might find something at your advantage because I think,
[01:30:23.120 --> 01:30:29.520]   yes, look at that. It's on the top shelf. It's busy cow.
[01:30:32.160 --> 01:30:36.720]   So, yeah, that is a great deal, actually. That's got six of my favorite applications in that
[01:30:36.720 --> 01:30:40.800]   particular bundle, productivemax. The thing with these bundles is if you can get at least two or three
[01:30:40.800 --> 01:30:45.040]   applications out of each bundle, and then the normally round, I think the productive max one is
[01:30:45.040 --> 01:30:50.080]   39. The others are all 49. If you can get three really good applications out of each bundle,
[01:30:50.080 --> 01:30:55.120]   you're doing really well. So there's four to choose from. Just go in and have a look and
[01:30:55.120 --> 01:30:58.880]   see what you think. But that productivemax one is a particularly good one for 39.99.
[01:30:58.880 --> 01:31:02.400]   And that includes busy cow as well. And launch bar. Love launch.
[01:31:02.400 --> 01:31:04.880]   I'm a lunch bar. Yeah, there's totally love launch bar.
[01:31:04.880 --> 01:31:07.520]   Default folder X as well. Another one of my favorites.
[01:31:07.520 --> 01:31:13.040]   You're absolutely right. It really is like the Kellogg's variety pack when you have these bundles
[01:31:13.040 --> 01:31:18.000]   where so long as it's okay that there's an all brand, it's okay if there's like that sort of
[01:31:18.000 --> 01:31:22.240]   all mixed of corn and fishmeal that no one wants, as long as you get your fruit loops,
[01:31:22.240 --> 01:31:25.440]   as long as you get your lucky charms, as long as you get the ones that you want,
[01:31:25.440 --> 01:31:30.240]   it's still very much a bargain as long as you get the ones you want at prices that are far,
[01:31:30.240 --> 01:31:34.000]   far less than retail. It used to be as well. The people were very suspicious of bundles and
[01:31:34.000 --> 01:31:38.880]   used to think, oh, well, we're doing the developers out of the full retail price. But
[01:31:38.880 --> 01:31:44.240]   I think it's at the point now where by it's a standard thing now, developers do enjoy and get
[01:31:44.240 --> 01:31:48.880]   benefit from being part of these bundles. So people who buy software shouldn't really be too
[01:31:48.880 --> 01:31:52.720]   worried about that aspect of it and take advantage of it while it's there.
[01:31:53.520 --> 01:31:56.640]   You feel better because now that these bundles are more of a known quantity,
[01:31:56.640 --> 01:32:01.360]   if a developer enters an agreement that doesn't work for themselves, they could have
[01:32:01.360 --> 01:32:04.880]   asked around with people who had already done these bundle deals. So you know that they can go
[01:32:04.880 --> 01:32:08.480]   in a lot more better informed than they could a few years ago when these bundles first started popping
[01:32:08.480 --> 01:32:15.760]   up. Well, I have a non-pick and an actual pick. That really cool iPad stand that hangs out from
[01:32:15.760 --> 01:32:20.480]   the wall that looks like a sale is called the, I don't know how to pronounce this, what is the
[01:32:20.480 --> 01:32:25.520]   typographical symbol where you have the A and the E mush together? Well, let's call that the
[01:32:25.520 --> 01:32:32.960]   Schmengi. You spell it M Schmengi ST2. It's the mast 2. Fortunately, if you actually just simply
[01:32:32.960 --> 01:32:40.080]   go for mast 2 M-A-S-T space 2, you will find the right Kickstarter project for it. This is just
[01:32:40.080 --> 01:32:45.760]   this is just simple marketing. When you pick a name, make sure it doesn't, it doesn't have an
[01:32:45.760 --> 01:32:49.520]   unpronounceable character that cannot be spelled or typed. That's just, you know,
[01:32:49.520 --> 01:32:53.920]   Prince. There's a reason why Prince is now called Prince again, because people figured out that,
[01:32:53.920 --> 01:32:57.600]   you know what? We don't have a key for that thing that you've just given us. So tell you what,
[01:32:57.600 --> 01:33:01.120]   we're just going to re review the latest Michael Jackson album instead of yours. It's just
[01:33:01.120 --> 01:33:05.440]   simpler. We have their limited number of hours in the day. It is a Kickstarter project. They are
[01:33:05.440 --> 01:33:13.360]   on their way. They've got $482 of the 740 they need. They need 12 people to pledge $1 or more for
[01:33:13.360 --> 01:33:19.120]   $60. You get a handmade mast. If you are not in the United States of America, you pay an extra
[01:33:19.120 --> 01:33:26.640]   $25. But it looks pretty cool. The only the I just wish that there were an easy way to like mount it
[01:33:26.640 --> 01:33:31.760]   next to like in a shower, saw enclosure, because you do have to drill holes to get it in and it's
[01:33:31.760 --> 01:33:36.720]   made out of wood and steel. So really what you want is that for just that sort of lazy bathtub action,
[01:33:36.720 --> 01:33:40.240]   but well, can't be perfect. But still, I think you'll agree it looks pretty cool.
[01:33:40.880 --> 01:33:47.840]   My actual pick of the week has a triple threat feature for it. It's called Sky Safari 3.
[01:33:47.840 --> 01:33:51.680]   And Sky Safari is one of those legendary iOS apps that is just
[01:33:51.680 --> 01:33:59.680]   extremely well done and brings you a brand new view of things that you've already seen before.
[01:33:59.680 --> 01:34:04.800]   How many times have you been, I got actually got here on the screen behind me. How many times have
[01:34:04.800 --> 01:34:10.080]   you just like been in the backyard and you're having one of those times and realized that gosh,
[01:34:10.080 --> 01:34:14.320]   when I was younger, I was able to spot all these constellations and I knew what I was looking at
[01:34:14.320 --> 01:34:17.840]   in the sky. I should have set this up a little better, but now you can see some of that.
[01:34:17.840 --> 01:34:24.240]   I've got the I've got it running on the iPad right now. And really all it does, it gives you a view
[01:34:24.240 --> 01:34:30.240]   of the entire sky in front of you as it would appear to you. It uses location information and
[01:34:30.240 --> 01:34:34.800]   also knows, you know, obviously what day and what time it is. So it knows that if you're looking
[01:34:34.800 --> 01:34:40.960]   in this direction northeast, you should be able to see Perseus. So you can then just sort of just
[01:34:40.960 --> 01:34:48.960]   tap on Perseus to get a look at that constellation and just tap on that. And we'll actually give you
[01:34:48.960 --> 01:34:52.640]   more information about the constellation, all the stars that are built into it right now. I'm
[01:34:52.640 --> 01:34:59.920]   highlighting individual stars. You can zoom in to get all the star information here.
[01:35:00.800 --> 01:35:07.040]   Let's add there goes tap on info. There you go. And it's just it's like having a pair. It's
[01:35:07.040 --> 01:35:11.920]   like having an astronomer next to you who will show you exactly all the cool stuff that's around you.
[01:35:11.920 --> 01:35:19.440]   This is the it's available for it's a unified from app work on both your iPhone and your iPad.
[01:35:19.440 --> 01:35:25.840]   If you it's normally two 99 it's actually on sale for 99 cents through the 8th,
[01:35:25.840 --> 01:35:32.480]   December 8th, which is 40% off, excuse me, which is two thirds off. Also 40% of the purchase price
[01:35:32.480 --> 01:35:37.040]   goes to a good cause astronomers without borders. You go to astronomers without borders.org.
[01:35:37.040 --> 01:35:44.640]   They are it's a educational organization that basically sends astronomers out to educate people,
[01:35:44.640 --> 01:35:50.080]   educate kids about astronomy and the and the known world. It's a really cool it's a really cool
[01:35:50.080 --> 01:35:54.400]   lab really fun to play with really cheap and goes to a really good cause. So we got a triple threat
[01:35:54.400 --> 01:35:59.600]   of goodness and elegance there. So that is my pick of the week. Chris Breen of Mackerel.com.
[01:35:59.600 --> 01:36:04.080]   Thank you so much for being part of our little hooten any today. Even if you didn't want black,

[01:36:07.760 --> 01:36:12.480]   in tutorial is so good that doesn't require like phony studio effects as a musician yourself.
[01:36:12.480 --> 01:36:17.040]   You know that when you see the auto tune kick in, it's not because the person was so good a singer
[01:36:17.040 --> 01:36:19.840]   that they decided to make it even better was because they were crummy and you didn't have
[01:36:19.840 --> 01:36:24.560]   enhancement. You need no such enhancement. Where can people go to find more of the Chris Breen

[01:38:21.280 --> 01:38:28.160]   Really? You are you've been you've been in the Internet so long. Your URL is like L dot com.
[01:38:28.160 --> 01:38:35.360]   Yes, actually, we've been on the Internet so long that we had to do its dot U C P.
[01:38:35.360 --> 01:38:39.760]   So, you know, the dot com was one of those new fangled things that we added on later.
[01:38:39.760 --> 01:38:45.680]   But yes, so tidbits.com is where you can go to find everything we'd write in tidbits,
[01:38:45.680 --> 01:38:51.200]   free weekly email newsletter that we fill up with goodness throughout the week and then push

[01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:25.360]   of issues with iCloud and Joe is the well, as far as I know, the foremost expert on what to do
[01:39:25.360 --> 01:39:31.600]   about that. Excellent. Yeah, I've been having my own little stressed out problems with iCloud
[01:39:31.600 --> 01:39:36.640]   recently. It's it's it's like that tango partner keeps tipping on your feet, but she smells so good.

[01:39:51.840 --> 01:39:56.000]   able to spell my last name. It was his last name too. I really think it was a spite issue as opposed
[01:39:56.000 --> 01:40:01.280]   to a spelling issue. You can actually go to cwob.com for the celestial ways to bandwidth, which will
