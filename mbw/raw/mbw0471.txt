[00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:22.560]   the new Apple TV with its game-centric remote control
[00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.240]   and so much more details on that, plus the iPhone 6S
[00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:29.480]   and 6S, plus so much detail, so much news.

[00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:55.240]   I am not Leo, but an incredible simulation.
[00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:56.120]   My name is Mike Elgin.
[00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:57.480]   I'm the news director here at Twit.
[00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:00.080]   And with me is Alex Lindsay.
[00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.760]   I'm back.
[00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:01.280]   How you doing?
[00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:02.480]   I'm feeling like we were just here.
[00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:03.800]   It was like minutes ago.
[00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:06.080]   It felt like very, very strange.
[00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:08.920]   And we also have on Skype Adam Christensen,
[00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:10.240]   who's the host of MacCast.
[00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:12.040]   Welcome to the show, Adam.
[00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:13.240]   Hey, thanks for having me.
[00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:14.320]   Glad I could be on.
[00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:16.280]   Now, I don't know if you watched the event or not,
[00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:18.760]   just kidding.
[00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:19.320]   So before--
[00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:20.160]   I think we all did.
[00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:24.400]   Yeah, so Apple, of course, just had their big Hey Siri event.
[00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:26.600]   And there's lots of details.
[00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:30.120]   This is one of those events where they didn't introduce
[00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:32.320]   a completely new product line.
[00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:34.160]   The iPad, which you've never seen before,
[00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:36.960]   they did come out with an iPad we haven't seen before.
[00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:38.360]   But generally, there's a lot of details,
[00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:41.400]   a lot of upgrading for existing lines.
[00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:44.880]   What is it out of this entire event, Adam, that completely
[00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:50.400]   jumped out at you and surprised you or blew you away
[00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:51.080]   in any sort of way?
[00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:52.240]   What jumps to mind?
[00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:54.200]   Yeah, definitely the iPad, bro.
[00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:55.800]   I mean, what they led with.
[00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:59.560]   I was not expected to be as excited about it going into it
[00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:04.040]   as I am now, having seen what Apple has done with that.
[00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:07.680]   I think it's going to be a big deal for iPads
[00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:09.840]   in a lot of different areas.
[00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:13.040]   And I think part of it, for me, is really the accessories
[00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:14.280]   that they announced along with it.
[00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:17.480]   We kind of knew a little bit about the stylus.
[00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:21.200]   I'm curious to dig in more and look deeper at the technology
[00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:23.040]   under there, but definitely what they demoed
[00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:26.240]   from the reality of the distortion field side of things
[00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:29.760]   is really amazing and looks like a good advancement
[00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:30.800]   on the stylus.
[00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:33.600]   And then the keyboard is also very interesting.
[00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:36.480]   And that I didn't see coming.
[00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:38.040]   So which is nice to be surprised.
[00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:42.280]   Yeah, so what you're talking about is the $99 Apple pencil
[00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:47.520]   and the $169, I believe, smart keyboard.
[00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:49.600]   What is it that they said about the keyboard that made you
[00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:51.440]   think that this was any different or any better
[00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:53.120]   than all the millions of other keyboards that
[00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:55.040]   were out there, or the keyboard that comes with the Surface
[00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:58.120]   Pro, or any other sort of keyboards
[00:03:58.120 --> 00:03:59.120]   that's built into a cover?
[00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:00.520]   What did you like about what they said?
[00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:02.560]   I like that it's the fabric material.
[00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:03.600]   I like the thinness.
[00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:07.720]   I like that it's able to be connected via the magnetic
[00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:10.360]   connector and draw power from the iPad.
[00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:12.800]   I mean, I think it's the integration.
[00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:14.880]   There's a lot of other great keyboard products out there.
[00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:17.120]   As a matter of fact, I'm happy now I held off
[00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:22.080]   because I was looking at the Logitech in a fabric,
[00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:26.360]   sort of fabric-y one, which is really nice as well.
[00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:28.800]   But the fact that this is built in and integrated--
[00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:30.800]   and I still might get that for my iPad, too,
[00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:33.240]   because I don't think I'm going to be upgrading that yet
[00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:34.640]   or air to rather.
[00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:37.440]   But I think it's really about the integration,
[00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:40.160]   just that it's built in and built into the cover
[00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:43.120]   and done in a way that really only Apple could do it.
[00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:45.600]   What's integrated with the cover hardware?
[00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:51.080]   With a new three-circle connector type of thing,
[00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:53.800]   which I assume is also connects magnetically.
[00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:55.320]   Yeah, but I'm assuming it does, yeah.
[00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:58.520]   Yeah, so can you imagine what else that might be used for
[00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:00.800]   other than just a really cool dock technology?
[00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:03.520]   What did you make of that new connector of standard
[00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:04.440]   that they came up with?
[00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:06.000]   Well, I mean, it looks like they still
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.600]   are using the lightning cable for your standard charging
[00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:09.280]   and stuff like that.
[00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:11.360]   So it looks like at this point, it really is only
[00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:14.200]   the keyboard accessory.
[00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:15.600]   I can't fathom what else.
[00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:18.600]   I mean, hopefully it's something they open up to third parties
[00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:21.840]   to, again, take their take on a keyboard.
[00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:22.440]   I don't know.
[00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:24.160]   Apple may keep that proprietary, though,
[00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:25.880]   that wouldn't surprise me.
[00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:27.320]   Yeah, wouldn't surprise me either.
[00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:29.840]   And of course, there are other surprises,
[00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:35.160]   including quad speakers, which I didn't quite understand
[00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:36.640]   what they were getting at.
[00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:39.680]   Are the speakers at the top of the iPad
[00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:43.680]   going to be playing like a higher register sound
[00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:47.880]   with the bottom or woofers or something like that?
[00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:49.160]   Are they mixing it up like that?
[00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:50.880]   Or is it quadriphonic sound?
[00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:53.080]   Or what did you make of what they were saying about the--
[00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:55.880]   I think it's stereo sound as far as I know.
[00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:58.920]   At least that was sort of the rumors in the lead up.
[00:05:58.920 --> 00:05:59.520]   But then they did.
[00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:00.600]   They talked about this.
[00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:02.920]   It's going to detect orientation and adjust.
[00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:05.040]   I'm hoping that maybe there's some sensors in there.
[00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:07.120]   I don't know if they would use ambient light sensors
[00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:09.480]   or something like that to maybe even adjust.
[00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:12.400]   If you actually cover up a speaker or something like that,
[00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:15.200]   maybe they can adapt the sound to sort of compensate.
[00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:17.560]   So you're not getting that muffling noise as you're holding it.
[00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:19.160]   Because I would imagine, since you've got speakers
[00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:22.720]   in each four corner, you may at one point sort of cover one up.
[00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:25.520]   And if the sound fluctuates, that sort
[00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:28.160]   of breaks the audio experience.
[00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:30.320]   Of course, Alex, this was a demo.
[00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:33.040]   And everything looks good in a demo
[00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:35.640]   unless you screw up the demo.
[00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:36.840]   What does the maker break on this?
[00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:39.480]   I mean, when we actually try it, when you actually try it,
[00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:42.800]   when you try the pen, the keyboard, the iPad Pro,
[00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:45.280]   what are the features that are going to make you thrilled
[00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:46.400]   and need to buy it?
[00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:47.400]   Or the things that's going to make you--
[00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:48.960]   oh, that's not what I expect.
[00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:49.640]   I'm not going to buy it.
[00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:50.800]   What's the maker break on that?
[00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:52.320]   It's the pen.
[00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:55.160]   I mean, for me, I think that they are the pencil.
[00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:55.760]   The pencil.
[00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:57.600]   The pencil.
[00:06:57.600 --> 00:07:01.560]   I think that the keyboard is going to be great.
[00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:02.120]   It's fine.
[00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:05.280]   I do like the connector because now you're not using Bluetooth.
[00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:06.680]   You're not trying to slot something
[00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:08.040]   into your lightning connector.
[00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:10.760]   So I think that that's fine.
[00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:14.680]   But I probably, without the pen technology, really--
[00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:18.120]   there, I think that's what's getting me really excited.
[00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:22.040]   I use my surface on a lot of things I really like to write.
[00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:22.540]   Yeah.
[00:07:22.540 --> 00:07:24.440]   So I really like to be able to draw on things
[00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:26.600]   and scratch things out and scribble on it and say,
[00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:28.800]   no, no, not this, this, and so on and so forth.
[00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:30.600]   And I think that that's going to be a big deal.
[00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:31.800]   And I think there's going to be a lot of artists.
[00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:34.320]   I think it's interesting that we hit some consumers,
[00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:35.480]   but we also hit medical.
[00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:36.280]   We hit artists.
[00:07:36.280 --> 00:07:37.360]   I think there's a lot of artists that
[00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:38.400]   are going to get really excited.
[00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:40.360]   I don't think this is the end of WACAM.
[00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:42.120]   I think a lot of people were mentioning that.
[00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:42.920]   Is this the end of WACAM?
[00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:44.680]   Because WACAM is still going to integrate
[00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:50.000]   with a lot of professional level tools.
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.160]   But I do think that obviously everyone making
[00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:57.000]   styluses for the iPad, they've got a little bit of time left.
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:58.880]   Do they sell to the old users?
[00:07:58.880 --> 00:07:59.080]   Yeah.
[00:07:59.080 --> 00:08:02.280]   Don't you think-- can you imagine, six months from now,
[00:08:02.280 --> 00:08:05.960]   the iPad Pro being used like a WACAM tablet
[00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:08.760]   and supported by some of those same companies
[00:08:08.760 --> 00:08:12.560]   that you alluded to using a 5K iMac display that's
[00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:15.480]   been rumored to do professional level?
[00:08:15.480 --> 00:08:15.880]   It could be.
[00:08:15.880 --> 00:08:18.680]   I mean, definitely you'd have to have a lightning connector
[00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:20.480]   to have enough low latency.
[00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:23.080]   But you could definitely see them using that.
[00:08:23.080 --> 00:08:25.200]   But I don't think you're going to get the same--
[00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:26.880]   I still think the WACAM tablet is going to give you
[00:08:26.880 --> 00:08:28.000]   even lower latency.
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000]   It's going to give you--
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:31.800]   I think that you're still getting more control.
[00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:34.440]   This isn't-- until I see it, I won't know.
[00:08:34.440 --> 00:08:36.000]   I mean, I own a lot of WACAM tablets.
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.320]   So it's always a WACAM tablet owner.
[00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:39.840]   I don't--
[00:08:39.840 --> 00:08:40.520]   It would take a lot.
[00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:43.760]   It would take a lot to give it up for a professional level
[00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:44.080]   pieces.
[00:08:44.080 --> 00:08:47.840]   But that said, being on the road-- and again,
[00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:48.800]   they're showing artists.
[00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:51.800]   But what about just doing a site survey
[00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:54.400]   and drawing things out and writing things in and taking
[00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:54.760]   notes?
[00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:57.080]   If that-- the problem with writing text
[00:08:57.080 --> 00:08:58.880]   is really the latency.
[00:08:58.880 --> 00:09:01.400]   Like if it doesn't feel like it's
[00:09:01.400 --> 00:09:03.400]   going as fast as you're writing, it's just really--
[00:09:03.400 --> 00:09:04.720]   it's very hard to write text.
[00:09:04.720 --> 00:09:05.680]   It's a horrible experience.
[00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:09.280]   Now, Anthony, let's get a handle on logistics.
[00:09:09.280 --> 00:09:11.560]   We want to talk to some people at the scene.
[00:09:11.560 --> 00:09:13.920]   And we also, Adam, you have a hard out.
[00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:16.080]   How much time do we have?
[00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:16.960]   Six minutes.
[00:09:16.960 --> 00:09:17.800]   20 minutes.
[00:09:17.800 --> 00:09:18.880]   20 minutes, OK.
[00:09:18.880 --> 00:09:21.400]   So Anthony, do we want to go to the venue?
[00:09:21.400 --> 00:09:22.120]   Hey, Mike.
[00:09:22.120 --> 00:09:22.840]   What's up?
[00:09:22.840 --> 00:09:23.800]   Not much.
[00:09:23.800 --> 00:09:27.800]   And this is through the miracle of smartphone technology.
[00:09:27.800 --> 00:09:30.160]   Thank you for coming on and talking to us about this.
[00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:32.240]   Now, you got a chance, I imagine,
[00:09:32.240 --> 00:09:33.880]   to go fondle these various products.
[00:09:33.880 --> 00:09:36.480]   Is that right?
[00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:37.920]   I did.
[00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:39.400]   And my fondling is all done.
[00:09:39.400 --> 00:09:40.640]   Now, I'm not talking to you.
[00:09:40.640 --> 00:09:41.520]   Wonderful.
[00:09:41.520 --> 00:09:44.280]   Now, where did they actually shepherd everybody
[00:09:44.280 --> 00:09:45.560]   to go look at the demos?
[00:09:45.560 --> 00:09:48.000]   Is there a secret room in that auditorium nobody knew about?
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:51.200]   Where did you actually go?
[00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:55.160]   Yeah, actually, the walls were black.
[00:09:55.160 --> 00:09:58.880]   And at the end, they just opened up.
[00:09:58.880 --> 00:10:00.840]   So you thought it was a wall, but it wasn't.
[00:10:01.840 --> 00:10:03.600]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:05.240]   That's cool.
[00:10:05.240 --> 00:10:09.960]   And they just threw the curtain, I guess, to the side or whatever.
[00:10:09.960 --> 00:10:11.720]   And of course, in San Francisco, when
[00:10:11.720 --> 00:10:13.560]   walls come crumbling down, everybody freaks out,
[00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:15.680]   because this is, of course, a major earthquake area.
[00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:18.400]   Now, let's start with the iPad Pro.
[00:10:18.400 --> 00:10:19.560]   You got a chance to play with that.
[00:10:19.560 --> 00:10:21.560]   Did you get a chance to play with the pen?
[00:10:21.560 --> 00:10:24.200]   I didn't get a chance to play with the pen.
[00:10:24.200 --> 00:10:27.480]   Everybody had the pen, and they were trying to use that.
[00:10:27.480 --> 00:10:30.080]   But I did watch some people use it, and they were drawing.
[00:10:30.080 --> 00:10:34.000]   And it looked pretty responsive to what they were doing.
[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:38.040]   Yeah, and did it appear to you that they
[00:10:38.040 --> 00:10:42.080]   solved the latency problem of eliminating
[00:10:42.080 --> 00:10:44.560]   the perceptive delay?
[00:10:44.560 --> 00:10:49.800]   It looked like it, because the people that were drawing,
[00:10:49.800 --> 00:10:53.040]   they would continue on, and that was great.
[00:10:53.040 --> 00:10:56.560]   So it wasn't that they were drawing a face,
[00:10:56.560 --> 00:10:59.400]   and then stopped because there was latency.
[00:10:59.400 --> 00:11:03.080]   They just went right through it.
[00:11:03.080 --> 00:11:08.120]   And I imagine you got a chance to use the iPhone.
[00:11:08.120 --> 00:11:09.520]   What was that like?
[00:11:09.520 --> 00:11:10.520]   Yes.
[00:11:10.520 --> 00:11:15.320]   Did you try the-- did you take a picture with the fancy Harry
[00:11:15.320 --> 00:11:17.280]   Potter feature with the photograph,
[00:11:17.280 --> 00:11:20.280]   where you take a picture, and it captures video before and after
[00:11:20.280 --> 00:11:21.840]   you take a picture?
[00:11:21.840 --> 00:11:26.240]   Yeah, well, it does, I think, a second and a half,
[00:11:26.240 --> 00:11:31.320]   before and after, so that you can have that touch,
[00:11:31.320 --> 00:11:32.440]   and it moves.
[00:11:32.440 --> 00:11:34.440]   So it's pretty cool.
[00:11:34.440 --> 00:11:35.200]   It is a cool thing.
[00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:36.240]   People are going to like that.
[00:11:36.240 --> 00:11:38.360]   Is it pretty much the same--
[00:11:38.360 --> 00:11:38.960]   this is Alex.
[00:11:38.960 --> 00:11:40.440]   I know you can't see me.
[00:11:40.440 --> 00:11:43.320]   Is it pretty much the same form factor?
[00:11:43.320 --> 00:11:45.800]   I mean, is it identical, or has it changed at all
[00:11:45.800 --> 00:11:47.200]   as far as size?
[00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:50.160]   Yeah.
[00:11:50.160 --> 00:11:55.200]   There's nothing wildly that has changed.
[00:11:55.200 --> 00:11:56.200]   I think the most--
[00:11:56.200 --> 00:11:57.200]   I think the most--
[00:11:57.200 --> 00:11:58.440]   --in just all the time in every iteration.
[00:11:58.440 --> 00:12:00.480]   The most important thing is do we have to buy new cases.
[00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:02.120]   I think that's what we all want to know,
[00:12:02.120 --> 00:12:04.840]   is do we have to buy new cases?
[00:12:04.840 --> 00:12:05.440]   You know what?
[00:12:05.440 --> 00:12:09.560]   I don't use cases, so I don't know.
[00:12:09.560 --> 00:12:12.480]   I would have tried to put a case on if I use them,
[00:12:12.480 --> 00:12:15.440]   but I never use them.
[00:12:15.440 --> 00:12:18.080]   And did you get a chance to try the remote, the new serial
[00:12:18.080 --> 00:12:18.840]   remote?
[00:12:18.840 --> 00:12:22.480]   They were demoing it in a secondary era.
[00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:26.680]   And the lineups to try the remote were crazy,
[00:12:26.680 --> 00:12:28.360]   so they were doing demos over there,
[00:12:28.360 --> 00:12:30.720]   and I watched one of those.
[00:12:30.720 --> 00:12:33.400]   It looked pretty much like it did on stage.
[00:12:33.400 --> 00:12:36.240]   You know, the press and say, I want
[00:12:36.240 --> 00:12:40.000]   to watch movies with Matthew McConaughey,
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:42.160]   and things just kind of pop up.
[00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:47.800]   I love the fact that it'll search across apps.
[00:12:47.800 --> 00:12:49.400]   You know, that's great.
[00:12:49.400 --> 00:12:50.800]   Yeah, that is a great feature.
[00:12:50.800 --> 00:12:54.960]   And of course, the biggest test of whether this thing is
[00:12:54.960 --> 00:12:59.080]   going to be good enough to replace other competitors
[00:12:59.080 --> 00:13:01.920]   is going to happen when we get the apps and how those work
[00:13:01.920 --> 00:13:03.440]   and what they do and so on.
[00:13:03.440 --> 00:13:09.200]   So before we let you go, do you have any sort of larger
[00:13:09.200 --> 00:13:09.840]   impressions?
[00:13:09.840 --> 00:13:12.160]   What is it out of this whole event
[00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:15.520]   that you were surprised by, that you were thrilled with,
[00:13:15.520 --> 00:13:18.360]   that you were disappointed by just overall impressions?
[00:13:18.360 --> 00:13:23.600]   I'm wondering about the Apple TV.
[00:13:23.600 --> 00:13:26.360]   I don't know if it's going to be a big gaming system or not.
[00:13:26.360 --> 00:13:28.520]   That'll be interesting to see.
[00:13:28.520 --> 00:13:31.200]   You know, they've had a great TV aspect to that,
[00:13:31.200 --> 00:13:33.280]   so we'll see how the rest works out.
[00:13:33.280 --> 00:13:36.760]   The iPad Pro, I was wondering if that was going
[00:13:36.760 --> 00:13:39.200]   to go to creative professionals or pros.
[00:13:39.200 --> 00:13:41.400]   They kind of, you know, productivity,
[00:13:41.400 --> 00:13:45.000]   and they pulled both out, so that's good to see.
[00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:48.000]   We'll see if that pushes iPad sales a bit more.
[00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.560]   And the iPhone, the thing that we didn't really know
[00:13:50.560 --> 00:13:53.320]   was all the things that you could do with 3D touch
[00:13:53.320 --> 00:13:56.920]   or force touch, and that was good to see.
[00:13:56.920 --> 00:13:58.240]   Yeah, I enjoyed those.
[00:13:58.240 --> 00:14:01.840]   So overall, I mean, it was a packed show.
[00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:04.280]   Did you get a sense of what the real difference is between--
[00:14:04.280 --> 00:14:05.200]   [INTERPOSING VOICES]
[00:14:05.200 --> 00:14:05.680]   Yeah.
[00:14:05.680 --> 00:14:07.560]   Did you get a sense of what the real difference is
[00:14:07.560 --> 00:14:09.760]   between force touch and 3D touch?
[00:14:09.760 --> 00:14:10.880]   What's the difference?
[00:14:10.880 --> 00:14:13.800]   Is 3D touch a software reference?
[00:14:13.800 --> 00:14:16.080]   I thought, even when I was watching it,
[00:14:16.080 --> 00:14:17.200]   that they were the same thing.
[00:14:17.200 --> 00:14:20.320]   So, you know, that's something I'm going to have to look at.
[00:14:20.320 --> 00:14:22.440]   Now, the only thing I can think of because force touch
[00:14:22.440 --> 00:14:26.000]   allows, you know, to press a little and then a lot.
[00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.080]   And that's what 3D touch seems to do, too.
[00:14:28.080 --> 00:14:29.880]   So I don't know if they changed the name of it
[00:14:29.880 --> 00:14:33.440]   or what they did, but it seems to be identical.
[00:14:33.440 --> 00:14:35.560]   Jim Dowlarable, editor in chief of Loop Insight.
[00:14:35.560 --> 00:14:37.960]   Thank you so much for taking a few minutes here
[00:14:37.960 --> 00:14:39.720]   to talk to us about your impressions.
[00:14:39.720 --> 00:14:41.040]   Once again, thank you for coming on.
[00:14:41.040 --> 00:14:42.200]   Thank you.
[00:14:42.200 --> 00:14:43.680]   All right.
[00:14:43.680 --> 00:14:44.840]   And a little bit of delay there.
[00:14:44.840 --> 00:14:48.240]   And again, that's Jim Dowlarable.
[00:14:48.240 --> 00:14:51.280]   And so, yeah, we still have a little bit more time with Adam.
[00:14:51.280 --> 00:14:53.400]   So I'm going to sort of interrogate you a little bit
[00:14:53.400 --> 00:14:54.240]   if you don't mind.
[00:14:54.240 --> 00:14:55.800]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:14:55.800 --> 00:14:58.760]   And what were your thoughts generally about the Apple TV?
[00:14:58.760 --> 00:15:00.080]   Were you impressed, disappointed?
[00:15:00.080 --> 00:15:02.600]   What did you think about what they announced?
[00:15:02.600 --> 00:15:03.520]   I wasn't impressed.
[00:15:03.520 --> 00:15:06.240]   I was looking very forward to this upgrade.
[00:15:06.240 --> 00:15:09.680]   I think bringing in apps is going to be a big deal
[00:15:09.680 --> 00:15:11.640]   for the platform.
[00:15:11.640 --> 00:15:13.320]   We know that Apple's been sort of--
[00:15:13.320 --> 00:15:15.720]   or we suspect that Apple's been trying
[00:15:15.720 --> 00:15:18.560]   to build this TV service and struggling with that.
[00:15:18.560 --> 00:15:21.560]   And so I think this is something that will get us through
[00:15:21.560 --> 00:15:23.560]   and tell them-- it may even end up
[00:15:23.560 --> 00:15:25.600]   being the long-term solution for Apple,
[00:15:25.600 --> 00:15:29.040]   because one concern I would have if they do TV services,
[00:15:29.040 --> 00:15:30.880]   what happens to these other providers?
[00:15:30.880 --> 00:15:33.280]   Hulu and Netflix and these companies
[00:15:33.280 --> 00:15:37.800]   that produce their own TV shows are on content for their platforms.
[00:15:37.800 --> 00:15:39.960]   Is that going to sort of rub them the wrong way?
[00:15:39.960 --> 00:15:42.360]   And would they want to pull out from having their apps
[00:15:42.360 --> 00:15:43.360]   on the Apple TV?
[00:15:43.360 --> 00:15:46.280]   So I think this is a good way to get all that content in there,
[00:15:46.280 --> 00:15:48.280]   and especially combined, like Jim was saying,
[00:15:48.280 --> 00:15:50.280]   with Universal Search, with Siri to be
[00:15:50.280 --> 00:15:53.320]   able to search for content across all of those
[00:15:53.320 --> 00:15:55.160]   just by doing a simple voice search,
[00:15:55.160 --> 00:15:58.960]   I think is really somewhat of a game changer.
[00:15:58.960 --> 00:16:01.600]   I was trying to think of other devices that have this,
[00:16:01.600 --> 00:16:03.400]   I guess, the Amazon Fire stuff has.
[00:16:03.400 --> 00:16:05.440]   And I haven't had a chance to play around with that,
[00:16:05.440 --> 00:16:07.760]   to be honest.
[00:16:07.760 --> 00:16:11.320]   So how much do we and by we, I mean you,
[00:16:11.320 --> 00:16:14.280]   know about TVOS?
[00:16:14.280 --> 00:16:15.480]   Not much.
[00:16:15.480 --> 00:16:17.680]   I mean, it's a brand new thing.
[00:16:17.680 --> 00:16:19.160]   So I'm in the developer program,
[00:16:19.160 --> 00:16:21.280]   so I will definitely be dating into that
[00:16:21.280 --> 00:16:25.440]   and find out what's different in there, what's available.
[00:16:25.440 --> 00:16:28.000]   I think one thing that's obvious is there's
[00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:31.360]   some way to tap into the metadata across the apps
[00:16:31.360 --> 00:16:33.080]   in terms of the Universal Search.
[00:16:33.080 --> 00:16:36.040]   I'm also very kind of excited about the new remote.
[00:16:36.040 --> 00:16:37.680]   I like the fact that it's bigger,
[00:16:37.680 --> 00:16:39.760]   and maybe I won't lose it all the time.
[00:16:39.760 --> 00:16:41.760]   It looked like too, for the gaming thing,
[00:16:41.760 --> 00:16:43.120]   you can have multiple remotes.
[00:16:43.120 --> 00:16:46.400]   So one thing I didn't see, and I'm trying to dig around
[00:16:46.400 --> 00:16:50.320]   and find is I don't think they announced what extra remotes
[00:16:50.320 --> 00:16:51.160]   cost.
[00:16:51.160 --> 00:16:52.000]   Yeah.
[00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:54.720]   Because you're going to want extra when you lose it.
[00:16:54.720 --> 00:16:57.040]   Well, or just to play games, I mean,
[00:16:57.040 --> 00:16:59.240]   they showed two player, four player games.
[00:16:59.240 --> 00:17:01.000]   So you would imagine everybody in the family
[00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:02.920]   is going to have a remote if you're
[00:17:02.920 --> 00:17:06.080]   going to go into the gaming thing.
[00:17:06.080 --> 00:17:07.280]   Yeah.
[00:17:07.280 --> 00:17:10.400]   Yeah, one of the things that struck me about this
[00:17:10.400 --> 00:17:12.560]   is that, of course, at 149 and 199,
[00:17:12.560 --> 00:17:15.200]   this is not huge for Apple.
[00:17:15.200 --> 00:17:19.120]   These can't possibly be huge margins.
[00:17:19.120 --> 00:17:23.440]   The Apple TV itself has some pretty serious smartphone type
[00:17:23.440 --> 00:17:24.840]   of electronics in it.
[00:17:24.840 --> 00:17:29.960]   And the remote, if I were to, based on nothing just except pure
[00:17:29.960 --> 00:17:32.640]   guesswork, I would guess that the price difference
[00:17:32.640 --> 00:17:35.640]   from manufacturing the new remote versus the older mode--
[00:17:35.640 --> 00:17:37.600]   I mean, the new one has sensors that has a touchscreen
[00:17:37.600 --> 00:17:39.200]   with special glass.
[00:17:39.200 --> 00:17:41.400]   It's got the Siri, integration, the microphone,
[00:17:41.400 --> 00:17:42.320]   all that kind of stuff.
[00:17:42.320 --> 00:17:45.200]   It's got to be three, four, five, 10 times more expensive
[00:17:45.200 --> 00:17:47.400]   to manufacture than the old remote.
[00:17:47.400 --> 00:17:51.800]   And if it costs them $10 a manufacturer, no big deal.
[00:17:51.800 --> 00:17:56.360]   But if it costs $70 or $80 to manufacture,
[00:17:56.360 --> 00:18:02.600]   then this is not a big profit generating product.
[00:18:02.600 --> 00:18:06.880]   They have this more expensive remote high-end Apple TV
[00:18:06.880 --> 00:18:09.480]   itself, and they're selling them for $150.
[00:18:09.480 --> 00:18:12.160]   No, I think it's about the content.
[00:18:12.160 --> 00:18:14.320]   It's about Apple selling more content.
[00:18:14.320 --> 00:18:18.480]   I'm sure they're not taking a loss on the hardware itself.
[00:18:18.480 --> 00:18:20.120]   That's just not something that Apple does.
[00:18:20.120 --> 00:18:22.080]   But yeah, it probably is a slimmer margin.
[00:18:22.080 --> 00:18:24.560]   I would agree with that than probably most of their products.
[00:18:24.560 --> 00:18:26.520]   But they look at this as a content play.
[00:18:26.520 --> 00:18:27.880]   They're going to sell more games.
[00:18:27.880 --> 00:18:31.120]   They're going to sell more content for the Apple TV.
[00:18:31.120 --> 00:18:35.800]   So they're going to make it up on the back end for sure.
[00:18:35.800 --> 00:18:38.400]   And what did you make of the--
[00:18:38.400 --> 00:18:41.000]   they seem to be implying that they have screen savers
[00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:42.840]   or something for the Apple TV?
[00:18:42.840 --> 00:18:44.360]   Did you understand what that was all about?
[00:18:44.360 --> 00:18:45.760]   Yeah, it just looks like--
[00:18:45.760 --> 00:18:47.720]   I mean, they've always had screen savers,
[00:18:47.720 --> 00:18:48.880]   some motion screen savers.
[00:18:48.880 --> 00:18:52.480]   I guess the idea would be you've got this big gorgeous flat screen
[00:18:52.480 --> 00:18:53.000]   TV.
[00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:55.720]   You want to show some moving artwork, again,
[00:18:55.720 --> 00:18:57.880]   getting back to that Harry Potter analogy.
[00:18:57.880 --> 00:19:00.720]   And it did sound like they're laying in some of the stuff
[00:19:00.720 --> 00:19:03.720]   they're doing with Watcho as to where the backgrounds would
[00:19:03.720 --> 00:19:06.400]   change depending on time of day, sort of things.
[00:19:06.400 --> 00:19:09.960]   So you could have the cityscape up in the afternoon
[00:19:09.960 --> 00:19:10.920]   as the sun went on.
[00:19:10.920 --> 00:19:12.240]   It would sort of adapt.
[00:19:12.240 --> 00:19:13.760]   I thought they mentioned that in there.
[00:19:13.760 --> 00:19:15.360]   But it went by pretty quickly.
[00:19:15.360 --> 00:19:17.400]   So I don't know if that's a feature that's
[00:19:17.400 --> 00:19:19.560]   going to be a really, really big deal for this.
[00:19:19.560 --> 00:19:22.280]   I really think it's going to be about the games and the apps
[00:19:22.280 --> 00:19:23.240]   on the Apple TV.
[00:19:23.240 --> 00:19:24.120]   And the other--
[00:19:24.120 --> 00:19:26.720]   I meant to mention earlier the other thing that was sort of
[00:19:26.720 --> 00:19:29.400]   not in the rumors was storage.
[00:19:29.400 --> 00:19:31.600]   I think a lot of the rumors were thinking storage was going
[00:19:31.600 --> 00:19:32.960]   to be 8 and 16 gigabytes.
[00:19:32.960 --> 00:19:34.560]   And I believe it's double that.
[00:19:34.560 --> 00:19:38.440]   This is at 32 and 64 or something like that.
[00:19:38.440 --> 00:19:40.920]   I think it's all about more storage for apps.
[00:19:40.920 --> 00:19:42.920]   Yeah.
[00:19:42.920 --> 00:19:44.160]   Very interesting.
[00:19:44.160 --> 00:19:46.800]   I do think that that screen saver thing is a little weird
[00:19:46.800 --> 00:19:50.040]   because they went out of their way to talk about how
[00:19:50.040 --> 00:19:51.840]   environmentally friendly they were.
[00:19:51.840 --> 00:19:53.560]   And then, oh, by the way, we have this feature that'll
[00:19:53.560 --> 00:19:56.680]   let you leave your TV on all the time, even when you're not
[00:19:56.680 --> 00:19:58.040]   actually using it.
[00:19:58.040 --> 00:19:59.080]   So a little weird.
[00:19:59.080 --> 00:20:03.520]   Now, most of the features in the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus--
[00:20:03.520 --> 00:20:06.600]   6S and 6S Plus were predicted.
[00:20:06.600 --> 00:20:11.640]   The 7,000 aluminum, lots of these things were predicted.
[00:20:11.640 --> 00:20:13.880]   But I don't think the 3D touch stuff was.
[00:20:13.880 --> 00:20:17.760]   I think that was one of the categories of features
[00:20:17.760 --> 00:20:19.760]   that I hadn't heard about yet.
[00:20:19.760 --> 00:20:22.560]   What did you think of that whole new interface convention
[00:20:22.560 --> 00:20:24.560]   that they trotted out today?
[00:20:24.560 --> 00:20:26.280]   The rumor mill called it force touch.
[00:20:26.280 --> 00:20:28.680]   So I think that was the main difference.
[00:20:28.680 --> 00:20:32.680]   And that one really kind of bugged me because, as we were
[00:20:32.680 --> 00:20:35.320]   saying earlier, I don't get the difference between the two.
[00:20:35.320 --> 00:20:38.240]   It seems like Apple marketing is messing around with us.
[00:20:38.240 --> 00:20:43.200]   And if you notice Craig Federighi, when he even talked
[00:20:43.200 --> 00:20:46.800]   about it, slipped and said force touch instead of 3D touch.
[00:20:46.800 --> 00:20:48.920]   So I think even internally at Apple,
[00:20:48.920 --> 00:20:51.720]   it's a little bit confusing.
[00:20:51.720 --> 00:20:54.760]   And the other thing, I was talking to some other folks
[00:20:54.760 --> 00:20:57.520]   I know about this as it was sort of happening live.
[00:20:57.520 --> 00:21:00.480]   And I like the new functionality.
[00:21:00.480 --> 00:21:03.360]   I like this idea of being able to sort of touch on an icon
[00:21:03.360 --> 00:21:05.880]   and expose additional features without having to open the app.
[00:21:05.880 --> 00:21:09.520]   Or it's got some almost spotlight functionality.
[00:21:09.520 --> 00:21:11.200]   So I can sort of preview a document
[00:21:11.200 --> 00:21:12.600]   without actually having to open that.
[00:21:12.600 --> 00:21:14.720]   And these are great features.
[00:21:14.720 --> 00:21:17.760]   The question is, did they really need a whole new hardware
[00:21:17.760 --> 00:21:19.800]   technology to enable that?
[00:21:19.800 --> 00:21:24.280]   It seems like if I just were to have a long press on a touchscreen,
[00:21:24.280 --> 00:21:27.560]   you could activate the same sort of UI functionality.
[00:21:27.560 --> 00:21:29.880]   So I'm curious to see how this is different.
[00:21:29.880 --> 00:21:32.240]   I know they have the haptic or taptic feedback
[00:21:32.240 --> 00:21:33.120]   with the taptic engine.
[00:21:33.120 --> 00:21:36.320]   So you'll get sort of a feel along with this.
[00:21:36.320 --> 00:21:39.600]   But it seems like they could have done this with software.
[00:21:39.600 --> 00:21:42.160]   So I'm curious to actually try it and see, you know,
[00:21:42.160 --> 00:21:46.360]   why did we need hardware to enable this functionality?
[00:21:46.360 --> 00:21:49.040]   Yeah, it was really kind of strange.
[00:21:49.040 --> 00:21:52.160]   And I love the Apple spin on the camera
[00:21:52.160 --> 00:21:56.080]   because basically the sort of the anti-Apple view of this
[00:21:56.080 --> 00:21:58.600]   is that everybody's had these like high megapixel cameras
[00:21:58.600 --> 00:21:59.480]   for a long, long time.
[00:21:59.480 --> 00:22:05.160]   And finally, Apple's got around to being what Samsung used
[00:22:05.160 --> 00:22:06.120]   to have years ago.
[00:22:06.120 --> 00:22:07.240]   And they're so behind the curve.
[00:22:07.240 --> 00:22:11.360]   Apple's spin was, oh, when people go up to like 12 megapixels
[00:22:11.360 --> 00:22:13.640]   and higher, it just ruins the photos.
[00:22:13.640 --> 00:22:14.760]   The photos look awful.
[00:22:14.760 --> 00:22:16.840]   But we Apple have cracked the code.
[00:22:16.840 --> 00:22:20.000]   We've figured out how to have 12 megapixel photos that
[00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:21.040]   look fantastic.
[00:22:21.040 --> 00:22:23.320]   And so we finally figured that out.
[00:22:23.320 --> 00:22:24.120]   And here it is.
[00:22:24.120 --> 00:22:25.800]   I thought that was a great--
[00:22:25.800 --> 00:22:28.040]   they might be completely accurate about that.
[00:22:28.040 --> 00:22:28.480]   I don't know.
[00:22:28.480 --> 00:22:30.480]   But I thought that was beautiful Apple spin.
[00:22:30.480 --> 00:22:35.000]   Well, I mean, yeah, they are accurate about that to a degree
[00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:37.040]   because it's not just about the megapixels.
[00:22:37.040 --> 00:22:38.840]   And I know a lot of pro photographers,
[00:22:38.840 --> 00:22:41.600]   and we talk about this, and I've talked to them about it.
[00:22:41.600 --> 00:22:43.880]   And consistently, the iPhone, when
[00:22:43.880 --> 00:22:46.080]   it goes up against other smartphone cameras,
[00:22:46.080 --> 00:22:49.240]   even with the 8 megapixel sensor now,
[00:22:49.240 --> 00:22:52.440]   it wins as being the top camera in terms of color accuracy
[00:22:52.440 --> 00:22:54.120]   in terms of all of these things.
[00:22:54.120 --> 00:22:56.080]   So it's really about the whole package.
[00:22:56.080 --> 00:22:57.520]   It's about the lens system.
[00:22:57.520 --> 00:22:59.160]   It's about the image processing.
[00:22:59.160 --> 00:23:02.160]   It's about the sensor and the quality of the sensor.
[00:23:02.160 --> 00:23:04.680]   So all these things go into making quality pictures.
[00:23:04.680 --> 00:23:05.800]   And I think that's--
[00:23:05.800 --> 00:23:09.600]   Apple really focuses on the end result when it comes to its cameras.
[00:23:09.600 --> 00:23:12.200]   And in a lot of ways, this is sort of like the megahertz
[00:23:12.200 --> 00:23:14.240]   war and all these other things that we've had in the past.
[00:23:14.240 --> 00:23:17.400]   More is not necessarily always better.
[00:23:17.400 --> 00:23:21.040]   Do they need to sort of drive that home to consumers?
[00:23:21.040 --> 00:23:23.320]   I guess at this kind of an event, you've got tech press,
[00:23:23.320 --> 00:23:24.880]   and you want to let those people know.
[00:23:24.880 --> 00:23:26.960]   But your average consumer just wants to know,
[00:23:26.960 --> 00:23:28.880]   does it take a great picture?
[00:23:28.880 --> 00:23:30.600]   And I think hands down, the iPhone
[00:23:30.600 --> 00:23:34.200]   is one of the best smartphone cameras out there.
[00:23:34.200 --> 00:23:37.760]   And just not even just my opinion, other sort of tests
[00:23:37.760 --> 00:23:38.400]   and things like that.
[00:23:38.400 --> 00:23:42.240]   It's not maybe the best, depending on upon the situation.
[00:23:42.240 --> 00:23:43.640]   But it's a pretty darn good camera.
[00:23:43.640 --> 00:23:46.000]   And it's just got better.
[00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:46.920]   Yeah.
[00:23:46.920 --> 00:23:48.880]   Well, I think we've got to let you go, sadly.
[00:23:48.880 --> 00:23:51.360]   Yeah, I appreciate it.
[00:23:51.360 --> 00:23:52.120]   Thanks for having me.
[00:23:52.120 --> 00:23:53.400]   Sorry, it's a busy day.
[00:23:53.400 --> 00:23:53.960]   It's a night day.
[00:23:53.960 --> 00:23:56.280]   And Apple ran a little long.
[00:23:56.280 --> 00:23:58.440]   Last thing I guess, interesting closing,
[00:23:58.440 --> 00:23:59.320]   I was surprised.
[00:23:59.320 --> 00:24:01.840]   It seemed like the pacing was going really good.
[00:24:01.840 --> 00:24:03.760]   At the beginning, they were kind of moving along
[00:24:03.760 --> 00:24:04.240]   through things.
[00:24:04.240 --> 00:24:06.400]   And I did kind of feel when they got to the iPhone stuff
[00:24:06.400 --> 00:24:08.840]   at the end, it's sort of drug.
[00:24:08.840 --> 00:24:11.200]   And I don't know if it's maybe because, again,
[00:24:11.200 --> 00:24:14.000]   I thought the biggest announcement was the iPad Pro.
[00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:16.400]   I would have almost flipped the thing around
[00:24:16.400 --> 00:24:18.800]   and had them lead with the iPhone
[00:24:18.800 --> 00:24:20.600]   and then close with the iPad Pro.
[00:24:20.600 --> 00:24:21.680]   But I don't know.
[00:24:21.680 --> 00:24:23.200]   They obviously made that decision,
[00:24:23.200 --> 00:24:25.560]   thinking that the iPhone was the thing they wanted to spend.
[00:24:25.560 --> 00:24:27.280]   It felt like they spent the most amount of time on it.
[00:24:27.280 --> 00:24:29.240]   I'll have to go back and watch and see if each one is
[00:24:29.240 --> 00:24:30.800]   sort of given equal time.
[00:24:30.800 --> 00:24:31.720]   But it felt longer.
[00:24:31.720 --> 00:24:33.440]   And it seemed to drag, at least for me.
[00:24:33.440 --> 00:24:34.120]   I don't know.
[00:24:34.120 --> 00:24:35.120]   Yeah.
[00:24:35.120 --> 00:24:38.160]   And the announcement was in four giant chunks.
[00:24:38.160 --> 00:24:41.800]   And that's a lot of chunks to muster up the kind of excitement
[00:24:41.800 --> 00:24:45.400]   and energy that they like to muster for these products.
[00:24:45.400 --> 00:24:49.160]   And I did feel like by the time they got to the iPhone,
[00:24:49.160 --> 00:24:52.280]   they were kind of like, well, just rattling off the features.
[00:24:52.280 --> 00:24:54.320]   And it wasn't really that exciting.
[00:24:54.320 --> 00:24:57.440]   OK, well, Adam Christensen is a host of MacCast,
[00:24:57.440 --> 00:25:00.440]   which you can find at maccast.com.
[00:25:00.440 --> 00:25:03.120]   And Adam, thank you so much for joining us
[00:25:03.120 --> 00:25:05.480]   on this incredibly busy Apple day.
[00:25:05.480 --> 00:25:06.280]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:25:06.280 --> 00:25:07.160]   Thanks for having me.
[00:25:07.160 --> 00:25:08.680]   All right, thank you.
[00:25:08.680 --> 00:25:13.280]   I did think that the pacing, the decisions around the venue,
[00:25:13.280 --> 00:25:17.240]   the fact that they crammed in four major categories
[00:25:17.240 --> 00:25:22.640]   all together into a single event was very different.
[00:25:22.640 --> 00:25:24.920]   It was just a completely-- the other thing is at the beginning
[00:25:24.920 --> 00:25:27.000]   that you normally say, oh, we've got this many downloads,
[00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:29.080]   and we've got this much thing, and we've dominated this one.
[00:25:29.080 --> 00:25:29.920]   And I bet you they--
[00:25:29.920 --> 00:25:31.320]   I think that they probably had that.
[00:25:31.320 --> 00:25:32.960]   And when they got to the total length,
[00:25:32.960 --> 00:25:35.320]   they were like, we're not going to add another 15 minutes to this.
[00:25:35.320 --> 00:25:37.520]   And first, I thought, maybe they didn't do it
[00:25:37.520 --> 00:25:40.280]   because the numbers aren't what something they want to talk about
[00:25:40.280 --> 00:25:40.640]   or whatever.
[00:25:40.640 --> 00:25:42.640]   But I really-- it looks like it was just editorial.
[00:25:42.640 --> 00:25:43.480]   We're going to cut this out.
[00:25:43.480 --> 00:25:45.840]   They probably had a presentation about the iPad mini,
[00:25:45.840 --> 00:25:50.120]   and they cut that out because someone probably said two hours
[00:25:50.120 --> 00:25:52.000]   as long as this is going to go.
[00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:54.000]   And we need to make sure that we don't go over that
[00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:56.280]   because we've been to three hour announcements.
[00:25:56.280 --> 00:25:57.120]   Sweet, huh.
[00:25:57.120 --> 00:26:00.000]   And with a lot less, in my opinion, a lot less to talk about.
[00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:01.360]   I mean, there was a lot to talk about here.
[00:26:01.360 --> 00:26:05.280]   I do agree that the iPhone part, I was a little like, OK,
[00:26:05.280 --> 00:26:06.880]   let's go, let's go, let's go.
[00:26:06.880 --> 00:26:09.320]   I think part of it was that it felt like it was moving slower.
[00:26:09.320 --> 00:26:10.760]   And also, part of it was they kept on showing stuff
[00:26:10.760 --> 00:26:11.640]   that I just wasn't--
[00:26:11.640 --> 00:26:13.440]   like, that's not why I'm going to get an iPhone.
[00:26:13.440 --> 00:26:16.040]   I think that's the hardest part with any of these,
[00:26:16.040 --> 00:26:17.760]   is you want to hit all these different industries.
[00:26:17.760 --> 00:26:20.560]   But a lot of it, I was like, I don't really care.
[00:26:20.560 --> 00:26:22.680]   Yeah, and apparently, investors are not
[00:26:22.680 --> 00:26:24.960]   moving the stock price of Apple yet.
[00:26:24.960 --> 00:26:26.480]   It's kind of staying flat.
[00:26:26.480 --> 00:26:27.920]   OK, let's talk about the Apple Watch.
[00:26:27.920 --> 00:26:31.200]   I mean, this clearly, this Apple Watch racket
[00:26:31.200 --> 00:26:34.520]   is clearly just bringing in hordes
[00:26:34.520 --> 00:26:35.560]   in huge amounts of money.
[00:26:35.560 --> 00:26:37.520]   These bands that they keep talking about,
[00:26:37.520 --> 00:26:39.440]   they're making a ton of money on watch bands.
[00:26:39.440 --> 00:26:41.520]   That's why they spend so much time at the very beginning
[00:26:41.520 --> 00:26:43.160]   of the event saying, well, here's a band.
[00:26:43.160 --> 00:26:43.680]   There's a band.
[00:26:43.680 --> 00:26:45.640]   Here's another band that wraps around your wrist twice.
[00:26:45.640 --> 00:26:46.480]   Buy more bands.
[00:26:46.480 --> 00:26:48.520]   You can buy one of the great things about the Apple Watch
[00:26:48.520 --> 00:26:50.680]   is you can take off the band and put on another band.
[00:26:50.680 --> 00:26:52.760]   If you have multiple Apple Watches with multiple bands,
[00:26:52.760 --> 00:26:53.920]   you'd imagine what you--
[00:26:53.920 --> 00:26:57.040]   I mean, it's like, it's so much money involved in these--
[00:26:57.040 --> 00:26:57.520]   It could be.
[00:26:57.520 --> 00:26:57.880]   It could be.
[00:26:57.880 --> 00:27:01.080]   I mean, I don't know whether they have a licensing set up.
[00:27:01.080 --> 00:27:03.560]   So because there's also a lot of third party bands.
[00:27:03.560 --> 00:27:05.360]   You know, there's a lot of people selling them on it.
[00:27:05.360 --> 00:27:07.120]   You go to Amazon and do iWatchBand.
[00:27:07.120 --> 00:27:09.360]   And there's a lot of them that are very inexpensive
[00:27:09.360 --> 00:27:10.720]   that you can order.
[00:27:10.720 --> 00:27:11.640]   I've ordered a couple of them.
[00:27:11.640 --> 00:27:17.120]   I will say that I stuck with the Apple-made ones so far.
[00:27:17.120 --> 00:27:19.680]   Haven't been that impressed with the ones that I bought.
[00:27:19.680 --> 00:27:22.600]   But I think that will grow as a market, too.
[00:27:22.600 --> 00:27:24.520]   I think part of that is making money.
[00:27:24.520 --> 00:27:27.280]   But I think the real issue there is really allowing people
[00:27:27.280 --> 00:27:29.800]   to--
[00:27:29.800 --> 00:27:33.240]   historically, has really been like, this is the only way
[00:27:33.240 --> 00:27:34.160]   it's going to look.
[00:27:34.160 --> 00:27:34.600]   Yeah.
[00:27:34.600 --> 00:27:36.640]   And so I think that part of this is you can customize it
[00:27:36.640 --> 00:27:37.880]   to however you want to look.
[00:27:37.880 --> 00:27:40.920]   And I think it has more to do for Apple, less to do with money,
[00:27:40.920 --> 00:27:45.160]   and more for you to figure out exactly your expression of it
[00:27:45.160 --> 00:27:47.200]   and having it be a form of your expression
[00:27:47.200 --> 00:27:50.440]   and pushing you to realize that it's not just the way you bought it.
[00:27:50.440 --> 00:27:52.400]   It's however you want to keep on adding to it.
[00:27:52.400 --> 00:27:54.600]   Because, in fact, wristwatches are purchased that way.
[00:27:54.600 --> 00:28:00.040]   You're looking to assert your individuality, your identity,
[00:28:00.040 --> 00:28:01.680]   your--
[00:28:01.680 --> 00:28:02.720]   And this is how--
[00:28:02.720 --> 00:28:04.200]   and see, I just assert mine by--
[00:28:04.200 --> 00:28:04.640]   Yeah.
[00:28:04.640 --> 00:28:07.680]   Mine's black with a black thing that doesn't get mad.
[00:28:07.680 --> 00:28:08.680]   But that's your personality.
[00:28:08.680 --> 00:28:09.320]   That's your identity.
[00:28:09.320 --> 00:28:09.820]   It is.
[00:28:09.820 --> 00:28:10.320]   It is.
[00:28:10.320 --> 00:28:11.320]   It is.
[00:28:11.320 --> 00:28:11.820]   It is.
[00:28:11.820 --> 00:28:13.880]   You might want to jump in the ocean at some point
[00:28:13.880 --> 00:28:14.920]   and not worry about it.
[00:28:14.920 --> 00:28:15.840]   That's your thing.
[00:28:15.840 --> 00:28:17.560]   OK, well, we have another guest who's
[00:28:17.560 --> 00:28:20.400]   joined us now via the miracle of Skype.
[00:28:20.400 --> 00:28:22.360]   Allison Sheridan of Nozilla Cast.
[00:28:22.360 --> 00:28:27.480]   Welcome to the special, very special episode of Mac
[00:28:27.480 --> 00:28:29.160]   Break Weekly, Allison.
[00:28:29.160 --> 00:28:31.120]   Hey, I got my Apple fan girl shirt on.
[00:28:31.120 --> 00:28:32.240]   Where's the-- there it is.
[00:28:32.240 --> 00:28:32.800]   Nice.
[00:28:32.800 --> 00:28:34.320]   You can see it above the lower third.
[00:28:34.320 --> 00:28:34.840]   Nice.
[00:28:34.840 --> 00:28:36.320]   So I dressed for the occasion, you know?
[00:28:36.320 --> 00:28:37.240]   Well, thank you for doing that.
[00:28:37.240 --> 00:28:39.600]   What did you think of this event overall?
[00:28:39.600 --> 00:28:41.240]   I thought it was-- I thought it was pretty cool.
[00:28:41.240 --> 00:28:44.280]   I really, really wish that I needed an iPad Pro.
[00:28:44.280 --> 00:28:46.720]   I wish I wanted one and needed one,
[00:28:46.720 --> 00:28:48.120]   because it sure seems really cool.
[00:28:48.120 --> 00:28:52.000]   I was shocked at the-- and let me use my fan girl words here
[00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:53.680]   is the low price.
[00:28:53.680 --> 00:28:55.720]   For an Apple product, I really thought
[00:28:55.720 --> 00:28:58.280]   that thing was coming in like $1,500.
[00:28:58.280 --> 00:29:01.560]   I figured the low, low end would be $9.99.
[00:29:01.560 --> 00:29:02.120]   Right.
[00:29:02.120 --> 00:29:02.560]   Yeah.
[00:29:02.560 --> 00:29:03.880]   No, I thought-- I definitely expected
[00:29:03.880 --> 00:29:06.560]   to be more expensive than it turned out to be.
[00:29:06.560 --> 00:29:07.400]   It's interesting.
[00:29:07.400 --> 00:29:08.920]   And the three price points were $7.
[00:29:08.920 --> 00:29:10.440]   How well we're trained.
[00:29:10.440 --> 00:29:11.080]   Yes, I know.
[00:29:11.080 --> 00:29:11.840]   Like, wow.
[00:29:11.840 --> 00:29:12.960]   That's a good expectation.
[00:29:12.960 --> 00:29:13.960]   Look at the eye watch.
[00:29:13.960 --> 00:29:16.560]   I'm like, when did I ever think that I'm going cheap by me?
[00:29:16.560 --> 00:29:17.840]   I'm sending $400 on a watch.
[00:29:17.840 --> 00:29:19.240]   Exactly.
[00:29:19.240 --> 00:29:20.240]   Exactly.
[00:29:20.240 --> 00:29:25.320]   So it's $7.99, $9.49, and $1,079.
[00:29:25.320 --> 00:29:28.840]   Those are the price points for the iPad Pro.
[00:29:28.840 --> 00:29:30.800]   And of course, the pencil is $99.
[00:29:30.800 --> 00:29:32.720]   The smart keyboard is $169.
[00:29:32.720 --> 00:29:39.240]   And yeah, I thought the iPad Pro was on the inexpensive side
[00:29:39.240 --> 00:29:40.960]   and the accessories were on the expensive side.
[00:29:40.960 --> 00:29:42.960]   That was my general impression.
[00:29:42.960 --> 00:29:46.640]   You mean the Surface Pro keyboard for the iPad Pro?
[00:29:46.640 --> 00:29:47.520]   Is that what you mean?
[00:29:47.520 --> 00:29:48.480]   Yes.
[00:29:48.480 --> 00:29:49.680]   Exactly.
[00:29:49.680 --> 00:29:51.400]   Brought to you by Microsoft.
[00:29:51.400 --> 00:29:52.040]   Exactly.
[00:29:52.040 --> 00:29:55.680]   I just wish I had a right brain and had some actual artistic
[00:29:55.680 --> 00:29:57.080]   talent.
[00:29:57.080 --> 00:29:58.680]   If you open it up here, this side's empty.
[00:29:58.680 --> 00:30:00.520]   It's all left brain for me.
[00:30:00.520 --> 00:30:02.720]   So I can't use it for any of the artistic stuff.
[00:30:02.720 --> 00:30:06.840]   But I use my iPad almost exclusively as a TV.
[00:30:06.840 --> 00:30:08.040]   And that's how I watch you guys.
[00:30:08.040 --> 00:30:09.920]   I carry it around everywhere I go.
[00:30:09.920 --> 00:30:11.560]   I take it to the gym and everything.
[00:30:11.560 --> 00:30:14.560]   And 12 inch, 12.9 inch, that's pretty big.
[00:30:14.560 --> 00:30:16.560]   I don't know if I can carry that around either.
[00:30:16.560 --> 00:30:17.080]   That would be it.
[00:30:17.080 --> 00:30:18.400]   That would be a hard one.
[00:30:18.400 --> 00:30:20.520]   At the gym, on the cycle.
[00:30:20.520 --> 00:30:21.000]   That's--
[00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:22.080]   Yeah, watch me.
[00:30:22.080 --> 00:30:23.040]   Yeah, I'm doing it.
[00:30:23.040 --> 00:30:23.480]   I'm doing it.
[00:30:23.480 --> 00:30:24.480]   I'm going to have the pen there too.
[00:30:24.480 --> 00:30:26.040]   It would be a gem.
[00:30:26.040 --> 00:30:28.640]   I was like, one with the pen pencil.
[00:30:28.640 --> 00:30:28.960]   All right.
[00:30:28.960 --> 00:30:30.440]   So let's take a break.
[00:30:30.440 --> 00:30:32.240]   And then when we come back, we'll talk a little bit more
[00:30:32.240 --> 00:30:33.040]   about the event.
[00:30:33.040 --> 00:30:37.000]   And then maybe we'll even talk about some other Apple-y stuff.
[00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:39.280]   One of our sponsors today is Squarespace.
[00:30:39.280 --> 00:30:43.240]   Squarespace, of course, is the very best place
[00:30:43.240 --> 00:30:44.680]   to build a website.
[00:30:44.680 --> 00:30:46.760]   Because they'll not only-- whether it's a blog, you
[00:30:46.760 --> 00:30:48.240]   want to sell things, whatever it is you're going to do
[00:30:48.240 --> 00:30:49.240]   with a website.
[00:30:49.240 --> 00:30:50.320]   Because they'll do the hosting.
[00:30:50.320 --> 00:30:52.480]   Their hosting is phenomenal.
[00:30:52.480 --> 00:30:55.080]   And no matter how much traffic you throw at your website
[00:30:55.080 --> 00:30:57.720]   or the world throws, if you get slash dotted
[00:30:57.720 --> 00:30:59.840]   or you start trending somewhere, they
[00:30:59.840 --> 00:31:03.800]   will scale up on the fly to make sure that your site never
[00:31:03.800 --> 00:31:04.280]   goes down.
[00:31:04.280 --> 00:31:07.440]   Now, it starts at $8 a month, which is, in my opinion,
[00:31:07.440 --> 00:31:10.080]   a ridiculously low price for what they give you.
[00:31:10.080 --> 00:31:11.640]   And one of the things that they give you
[00:31:11.640 --> 00:31:13.840]   that's very, very rare in this world
[00:31:13.840 --> 00:31:17.900]   is the ability to have beautiful, designed websites.
[00:31:17.900 --> 00:31:20.000]   Because they have these templates that are just amazing.
[00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:22.680]   They're designed by brilliant designers
[00:31:22.680 --> 00:31:26.480]   and the combination of the high quality of their design
[00:31:26.480 --> 00:31:29.880]   with the high quality of their engineering
[00:31:29.880 --> 00:31:32.920]   and management of this platform and the low price
[00:31:32.920 --> 00:31:34.360]   is a killer combination.
[00:31:34.360 --> 00:31:36.760]   Responsive design, they scale to mobile devices.
[00:31:36.760 --> 00:31:38.960]   Of course, most of your audience is always
[00:31:38.960 --> 00:31:40.160]   going to come in on a mobile device.
[00:31:40.160 --> 00:31:42.320]   So you have to look great on any sort of phone, any sort
[00:31:42.320 --> 00:31:43.480]   of tablet.
[00:31:43.480 --> 00:31:45.520]   Otherwise, you just don't have the right kind of website.
[00:31:45.520 --> 00:31:47.880]   And Squarespace just builds it right in.
[00:31:47.880 --> 00:31:51.720]   And they're now offering $100 in AdWords credit
[00:31:51.720 --> 00:31:53.120]   for business and commerce customers.
[00:31:53.120 --> 00:31:54.560]   So that's a great value.

[00:32:09.320 --> 00:32:12.880]   Squarespace, build it beautiful.
[00:32:12.880 --> 00:32:19.960]   All right, well, this was billed as a kind of--
[00:32:19.960 --> 00:32:21.880]   I guess the Apple billed is a serious thing.
[00:32:21.880 --> 00:32:26.160]   But the rumor, Mongers, can you hear me?
[00:32:26.160 --> 00:32:27.840]   I think I just lost.
[00:32:27.840 --> 00:32:29.040]   I'm still here.
[00:32:29.040 --> 00:32:29.400]   It's me.
[00:32:29.400 --> 00:32:31.240]   It's my earpiece.
[00:32:31.240 --> 00:32:33.360]   Build it is like the big iPhone--
[00:32:33.360 --> 00:32:35.920]   obviously, we're looking for this new iPhone--
[00:32:35.920 --> 00:32:39.520]   iPhone 6s, 6s, plus.
[00:32:39.520 --> 00:32:41.280]   They sort of skirted a controversy
[00:32:41.280 --> 00:32:44.840]   when they came out with the iPhone 6 and 6 plus
[00:32:44.840 --> 00:32:47.200]   because of Bendgate.
[00:32:47.200 --> 00:32:49.560]   And I don't know how much--
[00:32:49.560 --> 00:32:51.680]   I still don't have a really solid handle
[00:32:51.680 --> 00:32:54.760]   on how much of Bendgate was fabricated
[00:32:54.760 --> 00:32:57.520]   by grandstanding vloggers.
[00:32:57.520 --> 00:33:00.800]   And how much of it was a real problem with the phone?
[00:33:00.800 --> 00:33:04.000]   And it got to the point where innocent civilians
[00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:05.720]   were starting to question whether they're
[00:33:05.720 --> 00:33:07.720]   own phones-- they were seeing bent phones when they weren't
[00:33:07.720 --> 00:33:08.000]   even there.
[00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:10.120]   I mean, it was a kind of a crazy thing.
[00:33:10.120 --> 00:33:12.040]   Apple sort of got us through it, and everybody stopped
[00:33:12.040 --> 00:33:12.680]   talking about it.
[00:33:12.680 --> 00:33:14.480]   But now they came out with the new version
[00:33:14.480 --> 00:33:18.840]   with this Apple custom alloy 7,000 aluminum, as they call it.
[00:33:18.840 --> 00:33:20.400]   We're all familiar with 7,000 aluminum.
[00:33:20.400 --> 00:33:21.480]   Or lots of people are.
[00:33:21.480 --> 00:33:23.840]   It's very, very strong stuff.
[00:33:23.840 --> 00:33:30.680]   But do you think that Bendgate led directly to this--
[00:33:30.680 --> 00:33:31.440]   Yeah, I think--
[00:33:31.440 --> 00:33:33.800]   --programmed it like, let's bolster this thing.
[00:33:33.800 --> 00:33:34.760]   I think they did.
[00:33:34.760 --> 00:33:36.680]   I think when people actually tested it,
[00:33:36.680 --> 00:33:39.480]   they found that it was stiffer as stiff or stiffer
[00:33:39.480 --> 00:33:42.520]   than any other phone the same size.
[00:33:42.520 --> 00:33:47.360]   It was not really any weaker than other phones.
[00:33:47.360 --> 00:33:49.480]   I think that this just allows them to say, well, it's
[00:33:49.480 --> 00:33:52.440]   got even more resiliency.
[00:33:52.440 --> 00:33:54.080]   I mean, anything's going with enough forces
[00:33:54.080 --> 00:33:55.400]   going to bend in half.
[00:33:55.400 --> 00:34:00.240]   So I don't understand the whole, let's put my phone in my back
[00:34:00.240 --> 00:34:00.520]   pocket.
[00:34:00.520 --> 00:34:03.640]   I'm not going to put my phone in my back pocket kind of guy.
[00:34:03.640 --> 00:34:07.080]   So I've never had anything that I bent.
[00:34:07.080 --> 00:34:08.680]   I will say that as these phones got bigger,
[00:34:08.680 --> 00:34:14.480]   they're obviously a lot more flexible than the old iPhones,
[00:34:14.480 --> 00:34:17.320]   even those I wouldn't put in that kind of position.
[00:34:17.320 --> 00:34:19.920]   Mike, I'm an actual mechanical engineer.
[00:34:19.920 --> 00:34:22.960]   So as though I could speak with authority on this,
[00:34:22.960 --> 00:34:27.360]   I mean, if you make something thin and you make a divot in it
[00:34:27.360 --> 00:34:30.400]   where it's thinner and it has stress points in the corners,
[00:34:30.400 --> 00:34:32.120]   it's going to have problems.
[00:34:32.120 --> 00:34:34.760]   Whether or not this was a real big deal or not,
[00:34:34.760 --> 00:34:36.000]   I don't think it was.
[00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:38.960]   As Alex said, I think it was a consumer report.
[00:34:38.960 --> 00:34:41.360]   Somebody did a bunch of testing with the phones
[00:34:41.360 --> 00:34:44.320]   and did show that it wasn't any worse than anything else.
[00:34:44.320 --> 00:34:46.800]   But like you guys said, the thinner it is,
[00:34:46.800 --> 00:34:49.720]   and the straight to weight ratio of the materials
[00:34:49.720 --> 00:34:52.320]   that you choose can affect whether or not it's going to bend.
[00:34:52.320 --> 00:34:54.360]   So I believe some phones did bend.
[00:34:54.360 --> 00:34:56.600]   I don't believe it was a large number,
[00:34:56.600 --> 00:34:58.600]   but it's just so much fun to make fun of them
[00:34:58.600 --> 00:35:00.640]   when this stuff happens, right?
[00:35:00.640 --> 00:35:01.600]   It certainly is.
[00:35:01.600 --> 00:35:04.200]   And some of us make a good living at it.
[00:35:04.200 --> 00:35:05.000]   Yes.
[00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:06.440]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:35:06.440 --> 00:35:08.440]   So what did you think of all the photo stuff?
[00:35:08.440 --> 00:35:10.240]   I mean, there's a bunch of things here to talk about.
[00:35:10.240 --> 00:35:13.240]   There's the fact that they up the megapixel count.
[00:35:13.240 --> 00:35:18.640]   They have a-- I guess they're saying that they further
[00:35:18.640 --> 00:35:23.480]   improve the rear camera flash to adjust for the ambient light
[00:35:23.480 --> 00:35:24.560]   in the room.
[00:35:24.560 --> 00:35:26.240]   Didn't they advertise that last time?
[00:35:26.240 --> 00:35:27.640]   Yeah, I think they just made it better.
[00:35:27.640 --> 00:35:28.440]   They made it better.
[00:35:28.440 --> 00:35:29.160]   Yeah, it was better.
[00:35:29.160 --> 00:35:31.600]   But they have now a front flash, which is the screen,
[00:35:31.600 --> 00:35:33.760]   which I thought was-- there have been third party apps that
[00:35:33.760 --> 00:35:34.720]   do things like that.
[00:35:34.720 --> 00:35:40.760]   But I think it's built into the actual camera makes a lot of sense.
[00:35:40.760 --> 00:35:44.720]   Live photos, that was the-- nobody predicted live photos.
[00:35:44.720 --> 00:35:46.440]   It's kind of an odd feature.
[00:35:46.440 --> 00:35:47.160]   I personally--
[00:35:47.160 --> 00:35:48.360]   I think you have coined it, though.
[00:35:48.360 --> 00:35:49.520]   It is the Harry Potter feature.
[00:35:49.520 --> 00:35:51.480]   It is the Harry Potter feature, absolutely.
[00:35:51.480 --> 00:35:56.440]   And obviously, one of the things that I love to do--
[00:35:56.440 --> 00:36:00.000]   as you know, I'm a huge Google+ fan, which has AutoWassums.
[00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:02.640]   And I'm a huge iPhone fan, which has the ability to just
[00:36:02.640 --> 00:36:04.320]   rattle off 30 photos.
[00:36:04.320 --> 00:36:06.080]   What I typically do sometimes-- I'm
[00:36:06.080 --> 00:36:08.960]   so wasteful of those photos that I'm never
[00:36:08.960 --> 00:36:11.880]   going to use, that I'll typically--
[00:36:11.880 --> 00:36:14.440]   I'll hold the camera really still, and I'll hold the thing.
[00:36:14.440 --> 00:36:16.440]   And I'll keep taking pictures until I feel like I've
[00:36:16.440 --> 00:36:19.520]   gone through 10 of them without moving at all.
[00:36:19.520 --> 00:36:22.440]   And then I'll find those 10, and then I'll save those 10.
[00:36:22.440 --> 00:36:24.720]   And they're auto-uploaded to Google+.
[00:36:24.720 --> 00:36:27.680]   And Google+ creates what they used to call an auto-awesome.
[00:36:27.680 --> 00:36:28.760]   And it's a wonderful effect.
[00:36:28.760 --> 00:36:31.840]   It's similar to this effect, where you have subtle movement
[00:36:31.840 --> 00:36:33.560]   or short period of time.
[00:36:33.560 --> 00:36:37.600]   And so I actually think that if the world had an easy way
[00:36:37.600 --> 00:36:41.680]   to take little animations that were subtle, they would do it.
[00:36:41.680 --> 00:36:45.360]   And I think we were talking during the live broadcast
[00:36:45.360 --> 00:36:49.480]   of Andy was saying, well, is this a gimmick that people aren't
[00:36:49.480 --> 00:36:51.040]   going to jump on?
[00:36:51.040 --> 00:36:54.800]   I think this is going to be really popular, simply because I
[00:36:54.800 --> 00:36:57.920]   feel that I've been doing something kind of sorta like that.
[00:36:57.920 --> 00:36:59.480]   And I find it very gratifying.
[00:36:59.480 --> 00:37:02.760]   It's like a new medium, almost.
[00:37:02.760 --> 00:37:03.680]   And it could be.
[00:37:03.680 --> 00:37:05.800]   It's kind of half of-- what is that?
[00:37:05.800 --> 00:37:06.920]   Half of mine.
[00:37:06.920 --> 00:37:08.560]   Yes, exactly.
[00:37:08.560 --> 00:37:09.520]   Vines are just too long.
[00:37:09.520 --> 00:37:11.960]   Our attention span has gone from seven seconds.
[00:37:11.960 --> 00:37:13.520]   What are you going to do with seven seconds?
[00:37:13.520 --> 00:37:15.080]   You've got to get it down to three seconds.
[00:37:15.080 --> 00:37:17.000]   That's a funny point, because our attention spans
[00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:19.800]   are too fickle for a still photo.
[00:37:19.800 --> 00:37:20.840]   So it can't be a still photo.
[00:37:20.840 --> 00:37:22.560]   But we don't have time to watch a video.
[00:37:22.560 --> 00:37:23.200]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:37:23.200 --> 00:37:24.920]   This is the solution.
[00:37:24.920 --> 00:37:28.000]   It's funny you would bring up how long our attention span is.
[00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:30.720]   I remember a brilliant man named Alex Lindsey doing a speech
[00:37:30.720 --> 00:37:32.920]   many years ago where he talked about our attention span
[00:37:32.920 --> 00:37:34.320]   was five to seven minutes, because it
[00:37:34.320 --> 00:37:36.680]   was the time distance between commercials.
[00:37:36.680 --> 00:37:38.880]   But I guess it's gotten even shorter now.
[00:37:38.880 --> 00:37:41.640]   Yeah, we're down to five to seven seconds.
[00:37:41.640 --> 00:37:43.240]   I have two questions about it.
[00:37:43.240 --> 00:37:45.640]   And one of them is, are people going
[00:37:45.640 --> 00:37:47.200]   to lose their ever-loving minds?
[00:37:47.200 --> 00:37:50.040]   Because this means that Apple is looking at what you're
[00:37:50.040 --> 00:37:53.200]   doing a second and a half before you push the button?
[00:37:53.200 --> 00:37:55.240]   Are they going to go crazy about that?
[00:37:55.240 --> 00:37:56.120]   Yes.
[00:37:56.120 --> 00:37:57.160]   They are for no reason.
[00:37:57.160 --> 00:38:01.080]   I mean, someone's going to complain about it.
[00:38:01.080 --> 00:38:02.320]   And it's going to be this big thing.
[00:38:02.320 --> 00:38:03.600]   But we just have to-- I mean, there's
[00:38:03.600 --> 00:38:06.080]   a lot of other software that buffers.
[00:38:06.080 --> 00:38:08.600]   There's cameras that do professional cameras
[00:38:08.600 --> 00:38:10.280]   and consumer cameras that for a long time
[00:38:10.280 --> 00:38:12.760]   have done this buffering technique where you can take
[00:38:12.760 --> 00:38:14.840]   pictures from the past kind of thing.
[00:38:14.840 --> 00:38:19.320]   And so this isn't a new technology.
[00:38:19.320 --> 00:38:21.200]   It's just new for a phone.
[00:38:21.200 --> 00:38:25.160]   A lot of them will buffer up to 10 seconds, 15 seconds.
[00:38:25.160 --> 00:38:26.080]   Dash cams do this.
[00:38:26.080 --> 00:38:26.920]   It's a matter of course.
[00:38:26.920 --> 00:38:28.080]   That's how dash cams work.
[00:38:28.080 --> 00:38:29.440]   You're driving around Russia.
[00:38:29.440 --> 00:38:30.200]   Right.
[00:38:30.200 --> 00:38:32.640]   And then you see some crazy Russian scene.
[00:38:32.640 --> 00:38:35.920]   You push a button to capture what already happened.
[00:38:35.920 --> 00:38:38.040]   Yeah, so it's a great feature.
[00:38:38.040 --> 00:38:42.320]   When you do a dash cam-- sorry, you're actively saying,
[00:38:42.320 --> 00:38:44.320]   I would like to record my driving of things
[00:38:44.320 --> 00:38:46.560]   that I don't predict are going to happen.
[00:38:46.560 --> 00:38:48.760]   When you're just picking up your phone to take a picture,
[00:38:48.760 --> 00:38:51.880]   you're like, OK, get that slime off your face, whatever.
[00:38:51.880 --> 00:38:54.000]   You put your clothes on.
[00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:55.840]   That's a little bit different, I think.
[00:38:55.840 --> 00:38:57.880]   Well, there have been a lot of problems on eBay
[00:38:57.880 --> 00:39:00.720]   where people take a picture of that tea kettle.
[00:39:00.720 --> 00:39:02.040]   And then they post it.
[00:39:02.040 --> 00:39:03.520]   And they're like, oh, I'm going to sell my tea kettle.
[00:39:03.520 --> 00:39:05.280]   And then people notice that in the reflection
[00:39:05.280 --> 00:39:07.880]   of the person isn't wearing any clothing.
[00:39:07.880 --> 00:39:09.920]   So that sort of thing is going to happen here
[00:39:09.920 --> 00:39:11.600]   where they're going to take a picture and then
[00:39:11.600 --> 00:39:13.960]   immediately drop the camera while the video is still recording.
[00:39:13.960 --> 00:39:16.000]   And you're going to discover no clothing.
[00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:16.600]   It's right.
[00:39:16.600 --> 00:39:18.760]   Anthony Wiener effect.
[00:39:18.760 --> 00:39:20.520]   Yeah, so this is--
[00:39:20.520 --> 00:39:21.640]   I know it's going to happen.
[00:39:21.640 --> 00:39:23.480]   Dude, you're like, oh, no.
[00:39:23.480 --> 00:39:24.480]   Now that's a new medium.
[00:39:24.480 --> 00:39:25.320]   But they will have a choice.
[00:39:25.320 --> 00:39:26.400]   It's not like they're posting this.
[00:39:26.400 --> 00:39:27.960]   Well, they could be posted straight to Facebook.
[00:39:27.960 --> 00:39:29.120]   But I would look at it.
[00:39:29.120 --> 00:39:30.880]   I think all we can say is, look at it.
[00:39:30.880 --> 00:39:32.640]   Just look at it for a second, be where you posted.
[00:39:32.640 --> 00:39:33.160]   That's right.
[00:39:33.160 --> 00:39:34.160]   Exactly.
[00:39:34.160 --> 00:39:36.560]   It's actually going to engender a new behavior
[00:39:36.560 --> 00:39:39.560]   when taking photos of group photos, people photos,
[00:39:39.560 --> 00:39:40.600]   every kind of photo.
[00:39:40.600 --> 00:39:43.200]   Because you now you have to--
[00:39:43.200 --> 00:39:47.120]   When that was back, there were people
[00:39:47.120 --> 00:39:49.160]   who had cropped their photos too and realized
[00:39:49.160 --> 00:39:51.200]   that it was cropped on the web, not actually
[00:39:51.200 --> 00:39:51.880]   cropping the photo.
[00:39:51.880 --> 00:39:52.880]   So it was someone hacked the site.
[00:39:52.880 --> 00:39:54.480]   There was more to the photo than--
[00:39:54.480 --> 00:39:55.000]   Yeah.
[00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:56.320]   I won't mention who that happened to.
[00:39:56.320 --> 00:39:56.920]   It wasn't me.
[00:39:56.920 --> 00:39:58.160]   But it was--
[00:39:58.160 --> 00:39:59.280]   Yeah, sure.
[00:39:59.280 --> 00:40:01.000]   It was your friend, right?
[00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:03.040]   My second question, maybe Alex can answer this,
[00:40:03.040 --> 00:40:05.720]   is what is the format of that file?
[00:40:05.720 --> 00:40:08.320]   He very specifically said it's not video.
[00:40:08.320 --> 00:40:10.280]   He said it's a photo.
[00:40:10.280 --> 00:40:11.240]   So--
[00:40:11.240 --> 00:40:13.600]   Yeah, I don't know what the format of the file is.
[00:40:13.600 --> 00:40:15.640]   I think that if you export it, it'll look like a photo.
[00:40:15.640 --> 00:40:17.080]   I mean, it'll just be the photo.
[00:40:17.080 --> 00:40:21.640]   My guess is from what he said about making it small
[00:40:21.640 --> 00:40:23.040]   is that what they're going to do--
[00:40:23.040 --> 00:40:25.720]   because this is actually a pretty easy problem in some ways.
[00:40:25.720 --> 00:40:28.120]   But internally, they probably have-- it's probably just a folder.
[00:40:28.120 --> 00:40:30.160]   But the interesting thing about it
[00:40:30.160 --> 00:40:34.000]   is it's most likely not a minute and a half of just pure images.
[00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:39.080]   What it is is the photo you took as a what we would call a keyframe.
[00:40:39.080 --> 00:40:41.480]   And then it just does what we call temporal compression
[00:40:41.480 --> 00:40:43.480]   in either direction, which means it only pays attention
[00:40:43.480 --> 00:40:45.400]   to the pixels that changed.
[00:40:45.400 --> 00:40:48.760]   So when you see something-- if you ever rewind
[00:40:48.760 --> 00:40:51.160]   through an H.264 video, then you see suddenly
[00:40:51.160 --> 00:40:53.440]   all these big blocks because they were looking at something
[00:40:53.440 --> 00:40:56.800]   before them as the keyframe.
[00:40:56.800 --> 00:41:00.000]   And so of course, your image is fully there.
[00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:01.880]   But all the images on either side
[00:41:01.880 --> 00:41:04.280]   will probably look pretty blocky because it's only saving
[00:41:04.280 --> 00:41:05.400]   the information that changed.
[00:41:05.400 --> 00:41:07.840]   So especially if you're holding it still,
[00:41:07.840 --> 00:41:09.640]   a lot of that stays the same, which
[00:41:09.640 --> 00:41:11.280]   makes the photo a lot smaller.
[00:41:11.280 --> 00:41:13.080]   The effect might be like a cinemagraph,
[00:41:13.080 --> 00:41:15.280]   I think they used to call them, and they still do call them
[00:41:15.280 --> 00:41:17.120]   or something like that, where part of the picture
[00:41:17.120 --> 00:41:19.360]   is animated and the rest is so clearly.
[00:41:19.360 --> 00:41:20.640]   Yeah, and it'll be interesting.
[00:41:20.640 --> 00:41:22.640]   And there's a company that does--
[00:41:22.640 --> 00:41:27.440]   there's a model that has an app that does that on the phone.
[00:41:27.440 --> 00:41:29.720]   But there's a lot-- I think it'll be interesting.
[00:41:29.720 --> 00:41:31.120]   I mean, I think that it'll be interesting
[00:41:31.120 --> 00:41:34.040]   like when you look at putting it on your Apple TV,
[00:41:34.040 --> 00:41:36.440]   seeing these little things that are
[00:41:36.440 --> 00:41:38.040]   little moving things that are going.
[00:41:38.040 --> 00:41:40.600]   So instead of having just photos that are--
[00:41:40.600 --> 00:41:42.240]   you're zooming in and out of, you
[00:41:42.240 --> 00:41:44.280]   get these little glimpses of what's there.
[00:41:44.280 --> 00:41:50.400]   I'm guessing that it doesn't capture audio.
[00:41:50.400 --> 00:41:51.920]   Because that--
[00:41:51.920 --> 00:41:53.200]   They showed audio.
[00:41:53.200 --> 00:41:54.160]   Did they show audio too?
[00:41:54.160 --> 00:41:55.400]   Yeah, because you had a waterfall,
[00:41:55.400 --> 00:41:56.720]   and you could hear the waterfall.
[00:41:56.720 --> 00:41:57.240]   Oh, right.
[00:41:57.240 --> 00:41:58.720]   That is a little weird.
[00:41:58.720 --> 00:42:02.520]   I mean, I think that's more concerning from my perspective
[00:42:02.520 --> 00:42:06.480]   is capturing audio partially because there's--
[00:42:06.480 --> 00:42:09.280]   in the United States, there's some serious legal ramifications
[00:42:09.280 --> 00:42:11.720]   of capturing audio without telling people
[00:42:11.720 --> 00:42:12.520]   that you're capturing audio.
[00:42:12.520 --> 00:42:14.120]   You can do all the video you want,
[00:42:14.120 --> 00:42:15.360]   but you can start capturing audio,
[00:42:15.360 --> 00:42:16.320]   and it becomes more complex.
[00:42:16.320 --> 00:42:18.080]   Plus the embarrassment factor where you're
[00:42:18.080 --> 00:42:19.000]   going to post a picture.
[00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:20.680]   And then when you play, it's going to be like,
[00:42:20.680 --> 00:42:22.080]   just take the picture, you idiot.
[00:42:22.080 --> 00:42:23.640]   Yeah, yeah, exactly.
[00:42:23.640 --> 00:42:26.320]   If someone's going off about Obama,
[00:42:26.320 --> 00:42:29.240]   you know, and you're just like, oh.
[00:42:29.240 --> 00:42:30.680]   Yeah, you didn't have to do that.
[00:42:30.680 --> 00:42:32.880]   You know, it's entertainment, and it's
[00:42:32.880 --> 00:42:33.640]   going to be entertaining.
[00:42:33.640 --> 00:42:35.320]   Now, Alison, there was--
[00:42:35.320 --> 00:42:35.880]   Is it--
[00:42:35.880 --> 00:42:36.400]   Go ahead.
[00:42:36.400 --> 00:42:37.920]   I did want to elaborate on what you just said.
[00:42:37.920 --> 00:42:40.520]   So is it going to be slower to take that first photo?
[00:42:40.520 --> 00:42:42.280]   But do you lose a second and a half?
[00:42:42.280 --> 00:42:45.760]   No, because it should be that as soon as you open the photo
[00:42:45.760 --> 00:42:48.160]   out, my guess is that it's already--
[00:42:48.160 --> 00:42:52.200]   if that mode is on, it's already grabbing on to the last second
[00:42:52.200 --> 00:42:52.680]   and a half.
[00:42:52.680 --> 00:42:53.680]   OK.
[00:42:53.680 --> 00:42:53.680]   OK.
[00:42:53.680 --> 00:42:54.960]   And so as soon as you take the photo,
[00:42:54.960 --> 00:42:56.440]   it should react the same way.
[00:42:56.440 --> 00:42:57.520]   But in order to do it well--
[00:42:57.520 --> 00:42:58.000]   Open the camera.
[00:42:58.000 --> 00:42:58.640]   It's already--
[00:42:58.640 --> 00:42:59.160]   Yeah.
[00:42:59.160 --> 00:42:59.680]   That's my guess.
[00:42:59.680 --> 00:43:00.200]   Open the camera.
[00:43:00.200 --> 00:43:00.640]   It's already talking.
[00:43:00.640 --> 00:43:01.800]   It's already looking, listening.
[00:43:01.800 --> 00:43:02.320]   Yes.
[00:43:02.320 --> 00:43:02.840]   There you go.
[00:43:02.840 --> 00:43:03.360]   And dumping it.
[00:43:03.360 --> 00:43:06.360]   I guess it already sounds that, right?
[00:43:06.360 --> 00:43:06.880]   I don't know.
[00:43:06.880 --> 00:43:07.520]   He should sit on the display.
[00:43:07.520 --> 00:43:09.880]   I mean, it reminds me kind of the Amazon Fire Phone,
[00:43:09.880 --> 00:43:14.800]   which is now no longer in stock on the Amazon store
[00:43:14.800 --> 00:43:17.880]   and may never again be in stock.
[00:43:17.880 --> 00:43:20.360]   That has a feature where it would capture--
[00:43:20.360 --> 00:43:23.800]   so it had a feature that you push a single button.
[00:43:23.800 --> 00:43:25.160]   It would capture audio.
[00:43:25.160 --> 00:43:26.960]   And so if music was playing, it would tell you
[00:43:26.960 --> 00:43:28.840]   what the music was.
[00:43:28.840 --> 00:43:30.160]   It would capture video.
[00:43:30.160 --> 00:43:32.520]   If you pointed a product, it would identify the product.
[00:43:32.520 --> 00:43:34.280]   You've pointed it at a landmark.
[00:43:34.280 --> 00:43:35.840]   It would identify the landmark.
[00:43:35.840 --> 00:43:38.040]   But the problem was--
[00:43:38.040 --> 00:43:41.400]   let's say you just wanted to order some more
[00:43:41.400 --> 00:43:43.760]   Kellogg's Corn Flakes from Amazon or whatever.
[00:43:43.760 --> 00:43:46.960]   You press that button, pointed at that box of cereal,
[00:43:46.960 --> 00:43:49.040]   it would also capture the audio and upload it
[00:43:49.040 --> 00:43:51.480]   to Amazon servers without you even thinking about it,
[00:43:51.480 --> 00:43:53.480]   without you wanting it or anything like that.
[00:43:53.480 --> 00:43:55.640]   It kind of reminds me sort of kind of that.
[00:43:55.640 --> 00:43:59.800]   Well, if you think of how Amazon's voice activated,
[00:43:59.800 --> 00:44:02.640]   you know, I can't think of the little tower at the moment.
[00:44:02.640 --> 00:44:03.160]   You know that--
[00:44:03.160 --> 00:44:04.720]   Yeah, echo, echo.
[00:44:04.720 --> 00:44:09.120]   Or you think about some of the Samsung TVs.
[00:44:09.120 --> 00:44:11.720]   You know, they're taking all that audio and passing it back up.
[00:44:11.720 --> 00:44:15.360]   And that, to me, seems frightening.
[00:44:15.360 --> 00:44:16.960]   Yeah, and there's no information about when they're
[00:44:16.960 --> 00:44:18.520]   going to delete it or anything.
[00:44:18.520 --> 00:44:20.280]   Yeah, they haven't--
[00:44:20.280 --> 00:44:24.480]   I'm sure somewhere in line 483 out of your Yula,
[00:44:24.480 --> 00:44:26.560]   there's something that you said OK to that said,
[00:44:26.560 --> 00:44:27.760]   we're going to take all your voices.
[00:44:27.760 --> 00:44:30.040]   We're never going to delete it is what it says in there.
[00:44:30.040 --> 00:44:30.960]   I've read the whole thing.
[00:44:30.960 --> 00:44:34.880]   I will say that by accident, that the TV room in the new house
[00:44:34.880 --> 00:44:37.880]   is now very far away from everything else in the house.
[00:44:37.880 --> 00:44:38.480]   It's a bit built.
[00:44:38.480 --> 00:44:39.960]   Like, I'm just like, you know, I just
[00:44:39.960 --> 00:44:42.000]   want it living over in its own world now.
[00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:43.040]   That's funny.
[00:44:43.040 --> 00:44:47.360]   Now, Allison, there were a couple of like very aggressive
[00:44:47.360 --> 00:44:51.200]   moves that Apple made against Android and the carriers.
[00:44:51.200 --> 00:44:54.480]   One of them was the Move from Android app, which basically,
[00:44:54.480 --> 00:44:56.400]   if you're moving from an Android phone,
[00:44:56.400 --> 00:44:58.160]   you download this app, install it,
[00:44:58.160 --> 00:45:01.560]   and it will help grab all the stuff on your Android phone
[00:45:01.560 --> 00:45:04.440]   and deliver it lovingly into the iPhone, where you will live
[00:45:04.440 --> 00:45:08.800]   forever because, of course, no reverse app is possible.
[00:45:08.800 --> 00:45:10.440]   What did you make of that?
[00:45:10.440 --> 00:45:12.880]   And what did you make of the iPhone upgrade program
[00:45:12.880 --> 00:45:15.280]   where starting at $32 a month, you could just always
[00:45:15.280 --> 00:45:18.320]   have a fresh new phone no matter what going forward?
[00:45:18.320 --> 00:45:19.840]   What did you think about these?
[00:45:19.840 --> 00:45:21.240]   Well, as you stage that question, I'm
[00:45:21.240 --> 00:45:24.080]   reminded of someone who told me once that sarcasm is never
[00:45:24.080 --> 00:45:28.600]   necessary, but I believe in it at all times.
[00:45:28.600 --> 00:45:31.360]   I thought that that app already existed.
[00:45:31.360 --> 00:45:33.640]   I remembered there being something that would allow you
[00:45:33.640 --> 00:45:35.840]   to-- an app that would allow you to suck everything out
[00:45:35.840 --> 00:45:38.400]   of your Android phone and into the iPhone ready?
[00:45:38.400 --> 00:45:39.760]   Did I misremember that?
[00:45:39.760 --> 00:45:42.040]   I think it might have been a third party app that did it.
[00:45:42.040 --> 00:45:43.440]   But I think that what's interesting about this
[00:45:43.440 --> 00:45:45.280]   is not something I think with the sandboxing,
[00:45:45.280 --> 00:45:48.720]   I don't think that Android could do the same thing back.
[00:45:48.720 --> 00:45:51.880]   In sandboxing, I think that you couldn't move from iOS
[00:45:51.880 --> 00:45:54.840]   to Android, but with the way that Android is so much more
[00:45:54.840 --> 00:45:59.200]   open, you can write an app that can go into absolutely
[00:45:59.200 --> 00:46:01.760]   everything, pull all the stuff information out,
[00:46:01.760 --> 00:46:03.320]   and put it in there.
[00:46:03.320 --> 00:46:06.960]   But it's something-- I don't think that it could do everything
[00:46:06.960 --> 00:46:09.080]   that this one will be able to do, the third party app,
[00:46:09.080 --> 00:46:12.160]   because without it being something Apple made
[00:46:12.160 --> 00:46:13.840]   because of sandboxing.
[00:46:13.840 --> 00:46:15.320]   And I may be wrong.
[00:46:15.320 --> 00:46:15.760]   Yeah.
[00:46:15.760 --> 00:46:19.400]   So what you may be thinking of, Alison,
[00:46:19.400 --> 00:46:24.280]   is that the news about this particular app emerged much
[00:46:24.280 --> 00:46:25.320]   earlier this year.
[00:46:25.320 --> 00:46:29.000]   So it was called Moved iOS back then.
[00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:32.560]   And so I see reports as early as June, early June.
[00:46:32.560 --> 00:46:34.960]   So I just read too many rumor things, I guess.
[00:46:34.960 --> 00:46:35.760]   Exactly.
[00:46:35.760 --> 00:46:37.720]   I'm not amazed that Apple would do this.
[00:46:37.720 --> 00:46:41.440]   I'm more amazed at companies that build their software tools
[00:46:41.440 --> 00:46:43.720]   so that you can export your data.
[00:46:43.720 --> 00:46:45.400]   I love that companies do that.
[00:46:45.400 --> 00:46:47.240]   And it's fantastic for the user.
[00:46:47.240 --> 00:46:50.080]   But if I were to build something,
[00:46:50.080 --> 00:46:51.920]   I'd build it so you can suck from somebody else
[00:46:51.920 --> 00:46:54.040]   and pull into my stuff and never let you back out.
[00:46:54.040 --> 00:46:55.360]   That's the way I would do it.
[00:46:55.360 --> 00:46:56.960]   I think that the problem with that
[00:46:56.960 --> 00:47:01.840]   is that there are companies like I would be afraid--
[00:47:01.840 --> 00:47:03.800]   there's certain things that we use like Slack.
[00:47:03.800 --> 00:47:06.280]   And I need to know that my company
[00:47:06.280 --> 00:47:10.360]   generates between 6,000 and 8,000 Slack messages a week.
[00:47:10.360 --> 00:47:13.120]   And I get this little data thing.
[00:47:13.120 --> 00:47:17.560]   And I want to know that I can pull those out if I needed to.
[00:47:17.560 --> 00:47:18.880]   And so on and so forth.
[00:47:18.880 --> 00:47:22.000]   And I think that Google has actually, to their credit,
[00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:24.440]   has been very, very good about making sure
[00:47:24.440 --> 00:47:26.960]   that you're not scared to put your data into it
[00:47:26.960 --> 00:47:28.360]   because you know you can get it out.
[00:47:28.360 --> 00:47:30.040]   Because if you feel like you can never get it out,
[00:47:30.040 --> 00:47:32.240]   it's a one-way street, you may not use the product
[00:47:32.240 --> 00:47:36.520]   because you're afraid of it being a black hole.
[00:47:36.520 --> 00:47:38.160]   So I think that that-- in early days,
[00:47:38.160 --> 00:47:40.520]   I think that was very common to have kind of black holes.
[00:47:40.520 --> 00:47:41.560]   But then people stopped.
[00:47:41.560 --> 00:47:43.640]   Businesses especially stopped using it.
[00:47:43.640 --> 00:47:44.640]   Yeah.
[00:47:44.640 --> 00:47:48.480]   So I guess the way it is now, if you've got an app from Apple
[00:47:48.480 --> 00:47:50.240]   that allows you to suck the data out of your phone
[00:47:50.240 --> 00:47:52.920]   and put it into your new iPhone, if you still
[00:47:52.920 --> 00:47:56.000]   use the Google services, you could then suck them back out.
[00:47:56.000 --> 00:47:58.800]   I mean, they would still exist in the Google framework, right?
[00:47:58.800 --> 00:48:00.640]   You'd still have your Google Drive and your Google
[00:48:00.640 --> 00:48:01.440]   Mail and all that.
[00:48:01.440 --> 00:48:04.280]   So you aren't really losing what you had.
[00:48:04.280 --> 00:48:05.200]   That's a true statement.
[00:48:05.200 --> 00:48:06.840]   You're not losing it from the Android.
[00:48:06.840 --> 00:48:09.680]   You're just moving it somewhere else.
[00:48:09.680 --> 00:48:10.080]   What's happening?
[00:48:10.080 --> 00:48:11.200]   Is it really moving?
[00:48:11.200 --> 00:48:11.800]   It's not moving it.
[00:48:11.800 --> 00:48:13.560]   It's just copying it.
[00:48:13.560 --> 00:48:15.280]   Well, not even be copying it, right?
[00:48:15.280 --> 00:48:17.880]   If it's saying, OK, this is going to bring your Gmail--
[00:48:17.880 --> 00:48:20.480]   well, I guess a question is what all is it going to bring over?
[00:48:20.480 --> 00:48:22.720]   I mean, is it going to go search for apps that
[00:48:22.720 --> 00:48:25.040]   are the equivalent apps?
[00:48:25.040 --> 00:48:27.080]   I think it's going to be-- I'm finding the apps that
[00:48:27.080 --> 00:48:28.280]   would be the same.
[00:48:28.280 --> 00:48:29.800]   The same apps is my guests.
[00:48:29.800 --> 00:48:33.120]   And my other guess is that it'll take all the data from those
[00:48:33.120 --> 00:48:36.080]   so your contacts, your-- all those other things
[00:48:36.080 --> 00:48:39.720]   are most likely going to get moved over.
[00:48:39.720 --> 00:48:40.520]   OK.
[00:48:40.520 --> 00:48:43.840]   So your second question was about this $32 a month plan.
[00:48:43.840 --> 00:48:46.920]   When the last iPhone came out, I went through and did the math,
[00:48:46.920 --> 00:48:49.480]   made a spreadsheet, as an engineer would, of course,
[00:48:49.480 --> 00:48:51.360]   to figure out where the crossover points were
[00:48:51.360 --> 00:48:56.240]   between the AT&T Next plan that gives you the-- you pay monthly
[00:48:56.240 --> 00:48:58.480]   and then you've actually paid off the phone after,
[00:48:58.480 --> 00:48:59.840]   I think it's 20 months.
[00:48:59.840 --> 00:49:03.160]   And I found that at 18 months, it paid off the phone.
[00:49:03.160 --> 00:49:08.320]   So it was a better deal than doing the subsidized plan.
[00:49:08.320 --> 00:49:11.360]   I find this whole thing interesting
[00:49:11.360 --> 00:49:15.000]   to start sucking people into a $32 a month plan.
[00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:18.520]   Realize, when you say $32 a month, that's just for the phone.
[00:49:18.520 --> 00:49:21.560]   You probably still have to pay an access fee and for data
[00:49:21.560 --> 00:49:22.160]   and all that.
[00:49:22.160 --> 00:49:27.280]   So you are talking a trunkload of money.
[00:49:27.280 --> 00:49:28.760]   It's not our water bill.
[00:49:28.760 --> 00:49:31.440]   I think it's our gas bill is actually around $30 a month.
[00:49:31.440 --> 00:49:35.400]   So I can cook for what I can have a phone,
[00:49:35.400 --> 00:49:38.200]   and a hot water heater and all that stuff.
[00:49:38.200 --> 00:49:40.520]   Well, I'm sorry, a water heater, not a hot water heater.
[00:49:40.520 --> 00:49:42.400]   I've been corrected on that.
[00:49:42.400 --> 00:49:44.040]   So that's a lot of money.
[00:49:44.040 --> 00:49:47.040]   And it preys right on our desire to be in debt
[00:49:47.040 --> 00:49:49.320]   and have the newest, coolest thing at all time.
[00:49:49.320 --> 00:49:50.920]   And it's dangerous.
[00:49:50.920 --> 00:49:54.480]   My only argument about that is that this is what we've been doing.
[00:49:54.480 --> 00:49:56.320]   So until we unlocked the phone, we
[00:49:56.320 --> 00:49:58.960]   were making a payment that we didn't even know existed.
[00:49:58.960 --> 00:50:02.600]   So when we said it's not $900, it's $400 or $500,
[00:50:02.600 --> 00:50:06.280]   that just gives that delta we were making payments on.
[00:50:06.280 --> 00:50:08.840]   Now, we may not know, may not think of it that way,
[00:50:08.840 --> 00:50:11.160]   but that's what was actually happening.
[00:50:11.160 --> 00:50:13.040]   So I think that we've been doing that.
[00:50:13.040 --> 00:50:15.480]   We've been sucked into that for a long time.
[00:50:15.480 --> 00:50:17.840]   Now that we're going to unlock, I think the challenge is,
[00:50:17.840 --> 00:50:21.680]   is that now the real number is very large.
[00:50:21.680 --> 00:50:26.920]   The real number for a 6s plus is $950 or something like that.
[00:50:26.920 --> 00:50:29.920]   And so now everyone has--
[00:50:29.920 --> 00:50:32.840]   there are-- the sunglasses have been pulled off
[00:50:32.840 --> 00:50:34.160]   or the rose color glasses have been pulled off.
[00:50:34.160 --> 00:50:34.840]   They suddenly see it.
[00:50:34.840 --> 00:50:36.320]   And they're like, hey, no, but here's some more sunglasses.
[00:50:36.320 --> 00:50:37.480]   You can put them back on.
[00:50:37.480 --> 00:50:39.080]   You don't like that.
[00:50:39.080 --> 00:50:40.800]   Don't want you to lose your mind there.
[00:50:40.800 --> 00:50:43.640]   Like, it can be a little payment again.
[00:50:43.640 --> 00:50:48.880]   And so I think we've just swapped one pair of glasses
[00:50:48.880 --> 00:50:49.400]   for another.
[00:50:49.400 --> 00:50:52.120]   But I think that for a lot of people--
[00:50:52.120 --> 00:50:54.480]   I pay for my phones right out, so I have them.
[00:50:54.480 --> 00:50:58.440]   But I think that we're seeing all the manufacturers.
[00:50:58.440 --> 00:51:00.760]   I mean, all the carriers are moving down this path.
[00:51:00.760 --> 00:51:02.320]   Team Mobile, I think, was the first one out.
[00:51:02.320 --> 00:51:04.840]   And then I think that there's been AT&T and Verizon.
[00:51:04.840 --> 00:51:07.640]   And I think that that is--
[00:51:07.640 --> 00:51:09.880]   and I do think that Apple doesn't
[00:51:09.880 --> 00:51:13.160]   want to lose that direct connection to the--
[00:51:13.160 --> 00:51:15.720]   most people are still buying their phones from the Apple
[00:51:15.720 --> 00:51:16.880]   store.
[00:51:16.880 --> 00:51:19.200]   And I think that Apple would prefer to-- even while they're
[00:51:19.200 --> 00:51:21.640]   willing to let everybody sell, I think they prefer,
[00:51:21.640 --> 00:51:23.280]   especially in the United States, to keep it that way.
[00:51:23.280 --> 00:51:28.000]   Because I think that Apple eventually pushes everybody
[00:51:28.000 --> 00:51:29.560]   off the cliff.
[00:51:29.560 --> 00:51:31.800]   I also think that it has to be said
[00:51:31.800 --> 00:51:33.760]   that the carrier model that we currently use
[00:51:33.760 --> 00:51:35.360]   is worse than you described even.
[00:51:35.360 --> 00:51:40.600]   Because let's say you spend $25 a month for your iPhone.
[00:51:40.600 --> 00:51:43.480]   In addition, it's buried, it's hidden inside
[00:51:43.480 --> 00:51:45.120]   your wireless plan.
[00:51:45.120 --> 00:51:48.040]   And then you go two years.
[00:51:48.040 --> 00:51:49.800]   And then you go two years in a month, two years.
[00:51:49.800 --> 00:51:53.160]   You keep paying that $25 long after it's paid off.
[00:51:53.160 --> 00:51:55.520]   So lots of people keep up with it.
[00:51:55.520 --> 00:51:59.880]   But I also think that this is a big reverse engineering
[00:51:59.880 --> 00:52:01.720]   how Apple thinks about the world.
[00:52:01.720 --> 00:52:03.760]   One of the problems they're trying to solve here
[00:52:03.760 --> 00:52:06.880]   is that the current system incentivizes upgrading
[00:52:06.880 --> 00:52:08.400]   every two years.
[00:52:08.400 --> 00:52:12.520]   And that is unconscionable from Apple's point of view.
[00:52:12.520 --> 00:52:16.720]   As of today, the iPhone 6 is they don't even want to think
[00:52:16.720 --> 00:52:17.040]   about it.
[00:52:17.040 --> 00:52:19.600]   And the idea that people are still using these older phones
[00:52:19.600 --> 00:52:20.720]   probably drives them crazy.
[00:52:20.720 --> 00:52:21.720]   It's just unacceptable.
[00:52:21.720 --> 00:52:24.440]   And so this is a plan that we get everybody, especially
[00:52:24.440 --> 00:52:29.080]   the biggest fanboys, to get the latest and greatest right
[00:52:29.080 --> 00:52:31.200]   away all the time, never have--
[00:52:31.200 --> 00:52:33.040]   it's like in a perfect world, nobody would ever
[00:52:33.040 --> 00:52:36.080]   use an obsolete iPhone.
[00:52:36.080 --> 00:52:38.880]   Well, and I think that for a lot of people,
[00:52:38.880 --> 00:52:41.120]   I think that that payment isn't that painful.
[00:52:41.120 --> 00:52:42.120]   I mean, that payment isn't--
[00:52:42.120 --> 00:52:43.200]   Of course, that's the base payment.
[00:52:43.200 --> 00:52:47.320]   My guess is that if you get the blown out 6 plus s
[00:52:47.320 --> 00:52:51.520]   with 128, that's probably closer to $50 a month.
[00:52:51.520 --> 00:52:54.320]   But if you look at that payment and you look at it
[00:52:54.320 --> 00:52:57.240]   having it for two years, I think that--
[00:52:57.240 --> 00:52:58.600]   but you get a new phone every year.
[00:52:58.600 --> 00:53:00.800]   And then you take all those phones that are coming in
[00:53:00.800 --> 00:53:03.360]   that Apple now controls that flow.
[00:53:03.360 --> 00:53:06.520]   And then they funnel those all to emerging world countries.
[00:53:06.520 --> 00:53:07.440]   I mean, that's what's going to happen.
[00:53:07.440 --> 00:53:08.320]   They're not going to get recycled.
[00:53:08.320 --> 00:53:09.600]   They're going to get-- well, they are going to get recycled.
[00:53:09.600 --> 00:53:11.200]   But they're not going to get torn apart.
[00:53:11.200 --> 00:53:11.400]   They're--
[00:53:11.400 --> 00:53:11.880]   It'll be reused.
[00:53:11.880 --> 00:53:13.160]   They're going to be reused.
[00:53:13.160 --> 00:53:17.480]   And that, again, depresses the demand for Android
[00:53:17.480 --> 00:53:18.520]   in the emerging world.
[00:53:18.520 --> 00:53:22.600]   You know, so it works on a whole bunch of levels.
[00:53:22.600 --> 00:53:23.520]   Yeah, it really does.
[00:53:23.520 --> 00:53:26.480]   And also, I think, highlights a fact
[00:53:26.480 --> 00:53:28.240]   about the importance and centrality
[00:53:28.240 --> 00:53:29.360]   of smartphones in our lives.
[00:53:29.360 --> 00:53:31.360]   Let's say worst case scenario, it's
[00:53:31.360 --> 00:53:35.720]   going to be $60 a month for the high end, right?
[00:53:35.720 --> 00:53:37.400]   That's $2 a day.
[00:53:37.400 --> 00:53:40.760]   Do you think any of us believes that we get $2 of value
[00:53:40.760 --> 00:53:42.240]   per day out of our phones?
[00:53:42.240 --> 00:53:47.960]   I mean, we get $150 worth of value out of our phones every day.
[00:53:47.960 --> 00:53:50.360]   People would rather leave their house without their keys
[00:53:50.360 --> 00:53:53.040]   or even their kids than their phones, right?
[00:53:53.040 --> 00:53:54.560]   I mean, they're so important.
[00:53:54.560 --> 00:53:56.440]   They keep us in touch with everything.
[00:53:56.440 --> 00:53:57.320]   They entertain us.
[00:53:57.320 --> 00:54:00.960]   They inform-- like, phones are so important to us.
[00:54:00.960 --> 00:54:02.160]   Two bucks a day.
[00:54:02.160 --> 00:54:05.240]   We joke when there are certain countries on the way to Africa
[00:54:05.240 --> 00:54:08.960]   that you stop in, like in Uganda that's really slow,
[00:54:08.960 --> 00:54:10.600]   like on the tarmac.
[00:54:10.600 --> 00:54:11.720]   The Uganda is actually pretty fast.
[00:54:11.720 --> 00:54:14.400]   But in the tarmac, you're like--
[00:54:14.400 --> 00:54:16.080]   You're like, I'm on the ground.
[00:54:16.080 --> 00:54:17.560]   I should be able to get my mail.
[00:54:17.560 --> 00:54:18.560]   And you can't--
[00:54:18.560 --> 00:54:19.060]   Yeah.
[00:54:19.060 --> 00:54:19.960]   The way you get to--
[00:54:19.960 --> 00:54:20.440]   You know, like--
[00:54:20.440 --> 00:54:22.360]   It's like a long line of the methadone clinic.
[00:54:22.360 --> 00:54:23.760]   What you're saying is--
[00:54:23.760 --> 00:54:25.800]   Like, I know you were kidding around about Apple,
[00:54:25.800 --> 00:54:28.080]   thinking it's just horrible that anybody would be using
[00:54:28.080 --> 00:54:28.920]   an iPhone 6.
[00:54:28.920 --> 00:54:32.400]   And I'm sure you didn't mean that since they have made iOS 8.
[00:54:32.400 --> 00:54:34.440]   And I think iOS 9 is going to go all the way back
[00:54:34.440 --> 00:54:37.200]   to the iPhone 4s.
[00:54:37.200 --> 00:54:40.180]   But I think it's a terrific point that Alex is making
[00:54:40.180 --> 00:54:42.000]   about the flow down of these phones.
[00:54:42.000 --> 00:54:44.760]   And I think in a lot of ways, this new pricing scheme
[00:54:44.760 --> 00:54:46.640]   is actually going to hurt--
[00:54:46.640 --> 00:54:51.080]   I'm sorry-- iPhone and the Samsung Galaxy phones,
[00:54:51.080 --> 00:54:54.560]   because those are going to be so high priced that now you're
[00:54:54.560 --> 00:54:57.240]   Huawei's and your middle-range Motorola's,
[00:54:57.240 --> 00:54:59.680]   and those kind of phones are going to be a lot more popular,
[00:54:59.680 --> 00:55:01.080]   because you're going to go, well, wait a minute.
[00:55:01.080 --> 00:55:01.880]   This one's $200.
[00:55:01.880 --> 00:55:04.800]   That one's $600 to $800, $900.
[00:55:04.800 --> 00:55:07.600]   Well, this is like 90% is good for a quarter of the money.
[00:55:07.600 --> 00:55:09.320]   I think I'll go that way.
[00:55:09.320 --> 00:55:10.480]   I also think they're going to--
[00:55:10.480 --> 00:55:12.360]   I think this-- one of the subtle ways
[00:55:12.360 --> 00:55:16.040]   that this helps this idea, this trickle-down theory that you have,
[00:55:16.040 --> 00:55:18.840]   is that there will be more people, I think,
[00:55:18.840 --> 00:55:21.760]   under this program who will have the latest and greatest.
[00:55:21.760 --> 00:55:23.080]   I think that's clear.
[00:55:23.080 --> 00:55:26.400]   And that helps establish the premium nature of Apple's brand,
[00:55:26.400 --> 00:55:30.760]   which helps the desirability of second-hand iPhones.
[00:55:30.760 --> 00:55:33.720]   So people can walk around in whatever country they live in,
[00:55:33.720 --> 00:55:35.520]   the US or anywhere else.
[00:55:35.520 --> 00:55:37.560]   And even if they've got a two-year-old phone,
[00:55:37.560 --> 00:55:39.360]   they can say, I've got an iPhone.
[00:55:39.360 --> 00:55:40.360]   You've heard of the iPhone?
[00:55:40.360 --> 00:55:41.280]   I have an iPhone.
[00:55:41.280 --> 00:55:43.480]   It's like it's a premium brand.
[00:55:43.480 --> 00:55:44.600]   It's definitely seen as--
[00:55:44.600 --> 00:55:48.480]   I mean, there are-- in most of the emerging world countries
[00:55:48.480 --> 00:55:50.120]   that we've worked, iPhones are definitely
[00:55:50.120 --> 00:55:54.440]   seen as a luxury that people use to go off.
[00:55:54.440 --> 00:55:57.520]   So I think that that is stuff that people are interested in.
[00:55:57.520 --> 00:55:59.600]   But I think that also, if you look at the scale
[00:55:59.600 --> 00:56:02.120]   that Apple's kind of created from the 5S, which
[00:56:02.120 --> 00:56:07.840]   is a very, very good phone to the current phones,
[00:56:07.840 --> 00:56:11.200]   that whole top market is really hard to compete with.
[00:56:11.200 --> 00:56:13.080]   I mean, with all the features that they've added,
[00:56:13.080 --> 00:56:16.040]   with all the stability and everything else,
[00:56:16.040 --> 00:56:17.720]   and it really makes it hard.
[00:56:17.720 --> 00:56:20.560]   I mean, I think we're seeing Samsung constantly hitting up
[00:56:20.560 --> 00:56:23.800]   against this wall of there just isn't that much space
[00:56:23.800 --> 00:56:25.000]   in that upper market.
[00:56:25.000 --> 00:56:27.640]   And there is no money in the bottom market.
[00:56:27.640 --> 00:56:30.040]   There's a lot of sales.
[00:56:30.040 --> 00:56:31.000]   There's a lot of margin.
[00:56:31.000 --> 00:56:31.960]   There's just no margin.
[00:56:31.960 --> 00:56:33.320]   There's lots of money.
[00:56:33.320 --> 00:56:36.560]   There's lots of bulk that you can get out there.
[00:56:36.560 --> 00:56:40.400]   But how much they're making per phone is razor thin.
[00:56:40.400 --> 00:56:42.480]   And that makes it very complicated.
[00:56:42.480 --> 00:56:44.360]   It's hard to stay in business when
[00:56:44.360 --> 00:56:46.040]   you don't have any upper market.
[00:56:46.040 --> 00:56:48.120]   And Apple is just really making it difficult,
[00:56:48.120 --> 00:56:51.640]   whether you're a network, a netbook, which
[00:56:51.640 --> 00:56:54.400]   has been largely wiped out.
[00:56:54.400 --> 00:56:58.400]   I mean, the iPad Pro makes it very, very difficult to compete.
[00:56:58.400 --> 00:57:01.120]   And now they have iPad minis as low as $2.69.
[00:57:01.120 --> 00:57:05.080]   So now they're basically Apple saying from $2.69 up to $1,500,
[00:57:05.080 --> 00:57:08.600]   we're going to kind of make that one really a difficult place
[00:57:08.600 --> 00:57:09.120]   to play.
[00:57:09.120 --> 00:57:09.880]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:57:09.880 --> 00:57:12.000]   So I think that it's hard to get over.
[00:57:12.000 --> 00:57:12.880]   OK, and it looks like--
[00:57:12.880 --> 00:57:17.760]   I wanted to ask you, Alex, when you were talking about Africa
[00:57:17.760 --> 00:57:20.320]   a lot, I was in India recently and tried to use my iPhone 6
[00:57:20.320 --> 00:57:21.000]   there.
[00:57:21.000 --> 00:57:24.520]   And nobody there had ever heard of a nano SIM card.
[00:57:24.520 --> 00:57:25.880]   Do you run into that in Africa at all?
[00:57:25.880 --> 00:57:27.600]   They cut them.
[00:57:27.600 --> 00:57:30.120]   You walk into MTN, they got a little cutter.
[00:57:30.120 --> 00:57:34.040]   And it takes them 15 seconds.
[00:57:34.040 --> 00:57:34.840]   They just go, oh.
[00:57:34.840 --> 00:57:35.760]   And then they go, click.
[00:57:35.760 --> 00:57:37.440]   And then they just shove it in, and boom, it's working.
[00:57:37.440 --> 00:57:38.360]   I mean, it's in Rwanda.
[00:57:38.360 --> 00:57:40.080]   We just like boom.
[00:57:40.080 --> 00:57:40.840]   We suggested that.
[00:57:40.840 --> 00:57:41.600]   And we were in Delhi.
[00:57:41.600 --> 00:57:43.240]   It's not like we were out in the bush yet.
[00:57:43.240 --> 00:57:45.080]   And it was just like, huh?
[00:57:45.080 --> 00:57:45.600]   Yeah.
[00:57:45.600 --> 00:57:46.960]   What are you talking about?
[00:57:46.960 --> 00:57:48.320]   I mean, we showed it to them.
[00:57:48.320 --> 00:57:50.040]   And they're like-- and yeah, we had a translator.
[00:57:50.040 --> 00:57:51.080]   So it wasn't just us.
[00:57:51.080 --> 00:57:51.680]   Yeah.
[00:57:51.680 --> 00:57:53.280]   And then Indians come to the United States,
[00:57:53.280 --> 00:57:55.320]   and we've never heard of dual SIM card phones.
[00:57:55.320 --> 00:57:58.400]   So confusion is a world of confusion out there.
[00:57:58.400 --> 00:58:01.680]   It looks like we have Harry McCracken, the technologizer,
[00:58:01.680 --> 00:58:02.480]   on the phone there.
[00:58:02.480 --> 00:58:03.400]   How are you doing, Harry?
[00:58:03.400 --> 00:58:05.280]   Thank you for joining us today.
[00:58:05.280 --> 00:58:06.440]   I'm great.
[00:58:06.440 --> 00:58:08.280]   I just stepped out of the event.
[00:58:08.280 --> 00:58:09.280]   I'm going to talk to you guys.
[00:58:09.280 --> 00:58:12.320]   And it sounds like you spent a lot of time
[00:58:12.320 --> 00:58:15.200]   trying out the demos and fondling some of the things.
[00:58:15.200 --> 00:58:18.600]   What jumped out at you as you emerged from the building there?
[00:58:18.600 --> 00:58:20.640]   And you worked right across the street,
[00:58:20.640 --> 00:58:22.560]   so it's not exactly a long track here.
[00:58:22.560 --> 00:58:27.240]   But what jumps out at you after having touched some
[00:58:27.240 --> 00:58:28.720]   of the products there?
[00:58:28.720 --> 00:58:29.880]   What surprised you?
[00:58:29.880 --> 00:58:30.840]   What thrilled you?
[00:58:30.840 --> 00:58:32.120]   What disappointed you?
[00:58:32.120 --> 00:58:34.480]   What do you think about what you experienced
[00:58:34.480 --> 00:58:36.760]   when you tried some of the products in the demo room?
[00:58:36.760 --> 00:58:39.120]   Well, I'm personally, especially interested in the iPad Pro,
[00:58:39.120 --> 00:58:43.240]   just because I've been using an iPad for quite a long time
[00:58:43.240 --> 00:58:45.160]   to try to get useful stuff done.
[00:58:45.160 --> 00:58:47.800]   This is an iPad designed for productivity.
[00:58:47.800 --> 00:58:50.960]   And there have been all these third-party keyboard cases
[00:58:50.960 --> 00:58:53.640]   and third-party styluses for the iPad.
[00:58:53.640 --> 00:58:55.280]   And Apple is finally doing them.
[00:58:55.280 --> 00:58:57.680]   So the single thing I was most excited about doing
[00:58:57.680 --> 00:59:00.360]   was getting some hands-on time with those.
[00:59:00.360 --> 00:59:01.560]   And I just got a little bat.
[00:59:01.560 --> 00:59:04.160]   So you can't really render a final verdict,
[00:59:04.160 --> 00:59:05.920]   but they look pretty impressive from the time
[00:59:05.920 --> 00:59:06.920]   you wanted to get with them.
[00:59:06.920 --> 00:59:09.240]   Yeah, and you did try the pencil.
[00:59:09.240 --> 00:59:10.840]   Yes.
[00:59:10.840 --> 00:59:13.320]   I'm still a little unclear as to exactly what technology Apple
[00:59:13.320 --> 00:59:14.240]   is using.
[00:59:14.240 --> 00:59:16.680]   It sounds like it's not at all like Wacom,
[00:59:16.680 --> 00:59:18.600]   which is kind of the gold standard.
[00:59:18.600 --> 00:59:20.840]   And Styla says, but it worked well,
[00:59:20.840 --> 00:59:22.320]   that the pressure sensitivity is good.
[00:59:22.320 --> 00:59:24.560]   And for the first time with an iPad,
[00:59:24.560 --> 00:59:27.760]   you can rest your palm on the screen without worrying
[00:59:27.760 --> 00:59:31.400]   about messing up your input.
[00:59:31.400 --> 00:59:33.960]   And what can you tell us about the size, the weight,
[00:59:33.960 --> 00:59:35.760]   the handling of the pencil?
[00:59:35.760 --> 00:59:39.360]   What did that feel like to use in terms of just everyday use?
[00:59:39.360 --> 00:59:40.400]   It felt quite good.
[00:59:40.400 --> 00:59:42.480]   The weird thing about a lot of styluses for the iPads
[00:59:42.480 --> 00:59:45.000]   is, at least for me, they're too short.
[00:59:45.000 --> 00:59:46.680]   This one is nice and long.
[00:59:46.680 --> 00:59:48.320]   It kind of feels like a pencil.
[00:59:48.320 --> 00:59:53.680]   I still don't know how long it lasts in a charge,
[00:59:53.680 --> 00:59:55.640]   but when you do need to recharge it,
[00:59:55.640 --> 00:59:58.160]   you pull off the cap and there's a lightning connector
[00:59:58.160 --> 01:00:00.200]   so you can charge it easily.
[01:00:00.200 --> 01:00:01.840]   I noticed the guy doing the demo
[01:00:01.840 --> 01:00:04.960]   was holding it really far away from the tip.
[01:00:04.960 --> 01:00:06.720]   And I wondered whether he was doing that
[01:00:06.720 --> 01:00:08.840]   because he was afraid of accidental input
[01:00:08.840 --> 01:00:09.960]   with his wrist or something.
[01:00:09.960 --> 01:00:11.960]   That made me a little nervous.
[01:00:11.960 --> 01:00:14.480]   - What little time I got with it,
[01:00:14.480 --> 01:00:15.600]   that didn't seem to be an issue.
[01:00:15.600 --> 01:00:20.760]   I made a point of resting my hand and my arm on the screen.
[01:00:20.760 --> 01:00:24.040]   'Cause that usually trips me up when doing that on the iPad.
[01:00:24.040 --> 01:00:26.560]   And with this, it does a good job of noticing
[01:00:26.560 --> 01:00:28.280]   you're doing that and only paying attention
[01:00:28.280 --> 01:00:29.120]   to the pen input.
[01:00:29.120 --> 01:00:34.640]   - And how'd the iPhone 6S or 6S plus
[01:00:34.640 --> 01:00:35.480]   feel to you?
[01:00:35.480 --> 01:00:37.200]   Did anything about it feel different
[01:00:37.200 --> 01:00:38.640]   from the current generation of iPhones?
[01:00:38.640 --> 01:00:41.040]   Was it, you know, with the materials,
[01:00:41.040 --> 01:00:44.640]   the surfaces or any of that stuff any different?
[01:00:44.640 --> 01:00:46.080]   - Well, if you're just glancing at them,
[01:00:46.080 --> 01:00:47.520]   you're not gonna be able to tell them apart.
[01:00:47.520 --> 01:00:51.600]   As usual, every other year, they kept the industrial design.
[01:00:51.600 --> 01:00:55.240]   And the one thing you can get an impression of pretty quickly
[01:00:55.240 --> 01:00:59.040]   is the 3D touch, which is the new version of Force Touch,
[01:00:59.040 --> 01:01:01.080]   the pressure sensitive screen.
[01:01:01.080 --> 01:01:04.160]   And on the back book and on the Apple Watch
[01:01:04.160 --> 01:01:05.720]   is the kind of thing where if you don't
[01:01:05.720 --> 01:01:08.520]   make a point of using it, you might not even know it's there
[01:01:08.520 --> 01:01:12.400]   because it's just not doing stuff that's all that valuable.
[01:01:12.400 --> 01:01:16.320]   It seems like a phone is sort of the ideal surface
[01:01:16.320 --> 01:01:17.720]   for a pressure sensitive screen.
[01:01:17.720 --> 01:01:21.160]   And you can do things like if you're on the home screen,
[01:01:21.160 --> 01:01:24.720]   you can press down just a little bit on an app icon
[01:01:24.720 --> 01:01:26.920]   and get shortcuts that take you directly to features
[01:01:26.920 --> 01:01:28.000]   within an app.
[01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:31.600]   And that functionality is available to third parties.
[01:01:31.600 --> 01:01:33.720]   So any cap app can support it.
[01:01:33.720 --> 01:01:36.240]   And I really feel like it's a little bit like what right
[01:01:36.240 --> 01:01:40.840]   clicking has done with mice for decades.
[01:01:40.840 --> 01:01:42.280]   But that's fine because right clicking
[01:01:42.280 --> 01:01:43.880]   is one of the most useful things I've ever invented.
[01:01:43.880 --> 01:01:47.360]   And it's nice to see a similar idea come to the touch screen.
[01:01:47.360 --> 01:01:51.200]   What is the difference exactly between Force Touch
[01:01:51.200 --> 01:01:52.240]   and 3D Touch?
[01:01:52.240 --> 01:01:54.480]   As far as I can tell, they just gave it a nicer name.
[01:01:54.480 --> 01:01:56.800]   And Force Touch sounds a little intimidating.
[01:01:56.800 --> 01:01:59.720]   Force is not a pleasant word.
[01:01:59.720 --> 01:02:01.920]   3D is cooler and it also conveys the fact
[01:02:01.920 --> 01:02:05.040]   that you can press a little bit or a lot.
[01:02:05.040 --> 01:02:06.680]   And you get two different kinds of functionality.
[01:02:06.680 --> 01:02:11.360]   Like if you're in the Messages app and there's a link,
[01:02:11.360 --> 01:02:14.560]   if you touch slightly, you get a preview
[01:02:14.560 --> 01:02:15.680]   of whatever that link is.
[01:02:15.680 --> 01:02:17.320]   And if you press a little bit harder,
[01:02:17.320 --> 01:02:20.720]   it takes you to Safari or whatever.
[01:02:20.720 --> 01:02:22.760]   Did that feel natural, Harry?
[01:02:22.760 --> 01:02:26.040]   Watching since we didn't have any kind of physical feedback,
[01:02:26.040 --> 01:02:28.680]   watching it, it looked like, well, this is really confusing.
[01:02:28.680 --> 01:02:31.120]   But I'm guessing that it probably felt more natural
[01:02:31.120 --> 01:02:32.400]   than it looked.
[01:02:32.400 --> 01:02:34.800]   I would want to spend some time with that before I came
[01:02:34.800 --> 01:02:37.320]   to any firm conclusions.
[01:02:37.320 --> 01:02:39.760]   But with the Apple Watch, it's a little bit tricky
[01:02:39.760 --> 01:02:41.960]   because your finger is covering the whole screen anyway.
[01:02:41.960 --> 01:02:43.640]   So it's hard to see stuff.
[01:02:43.640 --> 01:02:47.120]   And on the MacBook, you're not touching the screen.
[01:02:47.120 --> 01:02:51.320]   You're touching the trackpad.
[01:02:51.320 --> 01:02:53.400]   The iPhone's a nice balance because the screen's big enough
[01:02:53.400 --> 01:02:54.800]   so you can see what you're doing.
[01:02:54.800 --> 01:02:57.080]   But it's direct manipulation rather than indirect,
[01:02:57.080 --> 01:02:58.880]   like a trackpad.
[01:02:58.880 --> 01:03:02.120]   And one last question, Harry, the Apple TV,
[01:03:02.120 --> 01:03:03.400]   is this going to do it for Apple?
[01:03:03.400 --> 01:03:05.760]   Have they finally cracked the code here with the Apple TV?
[01:03:05.760 --> 01:03:07.440]   Is this going to be a runaway hit?
[01:03:07.440 --> 01:03:10.000]   Or is it more of an incremental thing that's only
[01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:12.760]   going to thrill existing Apple TV users?
[01:03:12.760 --> 01:03:17.040]   You know, on paper, it seems pretty comparable in a lot of ways,
[01:03:17.040 --> 01:03:21.320]   especially Android TV and to something like Nvidia Shield,
[01:03:21.320 --> 01:03:24.120]   but also to Amazon's Fire TV.
[01:03:24.120 --> 01:03:26.280]   I really feel like this is sort of a little bit probably
[01:03:26.280 --> 01:03:28.720]   of an audition for this device because the thing
[01:03:28.720 --> 01:03:31.560]   that might be more transformative is if Apple comes up
[01:03:31.560 --> 01:03:34.440]   with a really good streaming service that starts to compete
[01:03:34.440 --> 01:03:35.600]   with cable.
[01:03:35.600 --> 01:03:38.400]   And all the indications are that even though they had no news
[01:03:38.400 --> 01:03:41.280]   about this today, they are working on lining up those deals.
[01:03:41.280 --> 01:03:44.800]   And at some point, you will have such a service.
[01:03:44.800 --> 01:03:47.840]   Right now, it looks really slick, but it looks like it could
[01:03:47.840 --> 01:03:49.960]   end up being the best of the streaming boxes.
[01:03:49.960 --> 01:03:51.640]   But in terms of basic functionality,
[01:03:51.640 --> 01:03:54.400]   it's doing stuff with other folks that are doing as well.
[01:03:54.400 --> 01:03:56.440]   So I didn't see any breakthrough in terms
[01:03:56.440 --> 01:03:59.400]   of the concept in this first iteration.
[01:03:59.400 --> 01:04:00.640]   One thing I--
[01:04:00.640 --> 01:04:01.800]   Go ahead, Alison.
[01:04:01.800 --> 01:04:04.840]   One thing I thought it did sound like it might do better.
[01:04:04.840 --> 01:04:06.400]   The Fire TV, from what I understand,
[01:04:06.400 --> 01:04:10.400]   when you use the search, it only searches inside Amazon.
[01:04:10.400 --> 01:04:12.760]   Correct me if I'm wrong on that, but that was my understanding.
[01:04:12.760 --> 01:04:15.240]   And Tim said that the search on Siri
[01:04:15.240 --> 01:04:19.800]   would go through iTunes, Netflix, Hulu, Showtime, and HBO.
[01:04:19.800 --> 01:04:23.000]   Fire TV started out being super Amazon-centric.
[01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:25.080]   I think that they've done software updates.
[01:04:25.080 --> 01:04:27.400]   They've loosened up a little bit on that.
[01:04:27.400 --> 01:04:29.920]   But it is nice to see Apple doing this universal search,
[01:04:29.920 --> 01:04:33.440]   because I think Apple skeptics always
[01:04:33.440 --> 01:04:34.920]   get a little paranoid about the notion
[01:04:34.920 --> 01:04:36.960]   that Apple is going to have a walled garden
[01:04:36.960 --> 01:04:38.920]   and prevent you from getting the other stuff.
[01:04:38.920 --> 01:04:41.920]   But this, it looks like if something is available on Netflix
[01:04:41.920 --> 01:04:44.480]   and on iTunes, and you subscribe to Netflix,
[01:04:44.480 --> 01:04:45.600]   it will tell you about that.
[01:04:45.600 --> 01:04:47.040]   So you don't end up buying it from iTunes
[01:04:47.040 --> 01:04:49.000]   if you don't need to.
[01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:49.760]   Good.
[01:04:49.760 --> 01:04:52.120]   It sounds like the Fire Department is on the way
[01:04:52.120 --> 01:04:54.360]   to put out that iPad Pro that caught on fire.
[01:04:54.360 --> 01:04:56.680]   Yeah, we're right here in the noisiest section
[01:04:56.680 --> 01:04:58.280]   of downtown San Francisco.
[01:04:58.280 --> 01:04:59.600]   Yeah, well, hang on to your wallet.
[01:04:59.600 --> 01:05:02.160]   All right, Harry McCracken, thank you so much for joining us
[01:05:02.160 --> 01:05:02.720]   today.
[01:05:02.720 --> 01:05:06.320]   Harry McCracken is the technologizer and technologizer.com.
[01:05:06.320 --> 01:05:08.480]   And also the tech editor at Fast Company.
[01:05:08.480 --> 01:05:10.320]   Thanks for joining us from the event there,
[01:05:10.320 --> 01:05:12.160]   at the Bill Graham Civic Auditorium.
[01:05:12.160 --> 01:05:12.640]   Thanks, folks.
[01:05:12.640 --> 01:05:13.280]   It was fun.
[01:05:13.280 --> 01:05:13.840]   All right, thank you.
[01:05:13.840 --> 01:05:15.640]   Bye-bye.
[01:05:15.640 --> 01:05:16.760]   Oh, there he goes.
[01:05:16.760 --> 01:05:17.880]   And let's take a break.
[01:05:17.880 --> 01:05:20.560]   And when we come back, we'll wrap up our show coverage.
[01:05:20.560 --> 01:05:21.880]   And then a little bit more news.
[01:05:21.880 --> 01:05:24.080]   And then we'll be good to go.
[01:05:24.080 --> 01:05:26.280]   One of our sponsors today is BrainTree.
[01:05:26.280 --> 01:05:28.640]   BrainTree is the solution.
[01:05:28.640 --> 01:05:32.440]   If you're looking for a mobile solution for mobile payments,
[01:05:32.440 --> 01:05:33.200]   it's a way to go.
[01:05:33.200 --> 01:05:35.480]   You can integrate this into your app or your website
[01:05:35.480 --> 01:05:37.840]   in probably about 30, 35 minutes, something like that.
[01:05:37.840 --> 01:05:38.560]   I'm told.
[01:05:38.560 --> 01:05:39.520]   I am not a developer.
[01:05:39.520 --> 01:05:40.800]   I'm just told this.
[01:05:40.800 --> 01:05:41.400]   You're told?
[01:05:41.400 --> 01:05:42.920]   I am told.
[01:05:42.920 --> 01:05:43.960]   Do you always do all kinds of stuff?
[01:05:43.960 --> 01:05:45.080]   Do you always do what you're told?
[01:05:45.080 --> 01:05:46.360]   I pretty much use your do.
[01:05:46.360 --> 01:05:47.760]   Yeah, absolutely.
[01:05:47.760 --> 01:05:48.960]   That's why I make the big bucks.
[01:05:48.960 --> 01:05:51.760]   No, the BrainTree is such a great payment solution,
[01:05:51.760 --> 01:05:55.240]   because not only-- it's important to make it easy for yourself,
[01:05:55.240 --> 01:05:57.800]   but what's really important is to make payments easier,
[01:05:57.800 --> 01:06:00.000]   easy for the people that you are-- you
[01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:01.760]   are trying to thrill with your product or service.
[01:06:01.760 --> 01:06:03.320]   You want them to pay for it.
[01:06:03.320 --> 01:06:04.320]   They want to pay for it.
[01:06:04.320 --> 01:06:05.960]   And BrainTree helps make that happen.
[01:06:05.960 --> 01:06:08.320]   And of course, some of the biggest companies in Silicon
[01:06:08.320 --> 01:06:09.120]   Valley use it.
[01:06:09.120 --> 01:06:10.520]   It's a great service.
[01:06:10.520 --> 01:06:13.920]   And best of all, it used to be in the old days,
[01:06:13.920 --> 01:06:16.840]   you'd have to go from payment provider to payment provider
[01:06:16.840 --> 01:06:17.480]   slogging.
[01:06:17.480 --> 01:06:20.280]   And you'd roll out your payment slowly.
[01:06:20.280 --> 01:06:21.960]   Oh, we support this in three months later.
[01:06:21.960 --> 01:06:24.000]   Oh, now we support this other payment type.
[01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:26.280]   I'm old enough to remember we had to write our own.
[01:06:26.280 --> 01:06:27.200]   We had to write our own.
[01:06:27.200 --> 01:06:31.040]   We had to know how to actually integrate with the credit card
[01:06:31.040 --> 01:06:34.880]   processor and the gateway and all that fun stuff.
[01:06:34.880 --> 01:06:35.920]   And it's so easy.
[01:06:35.920 --> 01:06:37.520]   And this is BrainTree.
[01:06:37.520 --> 01:06:39.600]   It's just crazy simple.
[01:06:39.600 --> 01:06:40.840]   Yeah, crazy simple.
[01:06:40.840 --> 01:06:42.320]   And it's simple for everybody.
[01:06:42.320 --> 01:06:43.160]   It's the way to go.
[01:06:43.160 --> 01:06:45.560]   You've got to use BrainTree if you're accepting payments
[01:06:45.560 --> 01:06:46.400]   on a mobile device.
[01:06:46.400 --> 01:06:47.360]   It's real money too.
[01:06:47.360 --> 01:06:50.040]   I mean, there are many places I won't
[01:06:50.040 --> 01:06:51.960]   go shopping because it's not as easy as Amazon.
[01:06:51.960 --> 01:06:52.460]   Yeah.
[01:06:52.460 --> 01:06:55.120]   Like literally just like, oh, it just has to be easy.
[01:06:55.120 --> 01:06:56.720]   And this is flat out.
[01:06:56.720 --> 01:06:58.160]   It's not just easy to develop for.
[01:06:58.160 --> 01:07:00.120]   But the big thing is that it's easy to use.
[01:07:00.120 --> 01:07:00.480]   Yeah.
[01:07:00.480 --> 01:07:03.600]   You lose sales because people don't want to go through it.
[01:07:03.600 --> 01:07:04.560]   That's absolutely true.
[01:07:04.560 --> 01:07:06.800]   BrainTree gives you a full stack payment solution.
[01:07:06.800 --> 01:07:09.080]   Support for all payment types your customers might want.
[01:07:09.080 --> 01:07:11.760]   You can start accepting PayPal, Apple Pay, Bitcoin, Venmo,
[01:07:11.760 --> 01:07:14.920]   credit cards, so much more, all with single integration
[01:07:14.920 --> 01:07:17.480]   across all platforms with superior fraud protection,

[01:07:27.600 --> 01:07:30.600]   And now we have the one and only Christina Warren standing
[01:07:30.600 --> 01:07:32.920]   by at the Bill Graham Civic Auditorium.
[01:07:32.920 --> 01:07:34.240]   Hey, Christina, how's it going?
[01:07:34.240 --> 01:07:35.680]   Are you having a good Apple day?
[01:07:35.680 --> 01:07:37.480]   They have pink iPhones.
[01:07:37.480 --> 01:07:38.560]   Oh my god.
[01:07:38.560 --> 01:07:40.400]   And Apple watches.
[01:07:40.400 --> 01:07:42.040]   Let's go talk about anything else.
[01:07:42.040 --> 01:07:44.240]   We have pink iPhones.
[01:07:44.240 --> 01:07:46.360]   But it's the new Apple Pink iPhone technology
[01:07:46.360 --> 01:07:47.000]   that they're using.
[01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:49.120]   That's what's important.
[01:07:49.120 --> 01:07:49.800]   Yes, yes.
[01:07:49.800 --> 01:07:51.080]   I mean, they're calling it rose gold.
[01:07:51.080 --> 01:07:53.000]   That's the innovation.
[01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:55.240]   But it's pink and it's amazing, and I want one.
[01:07:55.240 --> 01:07:57.320]   So what jumped out at you from this event?
[01:07:57.320 --> 01:07:59.720]   I know you always have a really unique perspective
[01:07:59.720 --> 01:08:01.120]   on these events.
[01:08:01.120 --> 01:08:02.720]   And of course, everything's faster.
[01:08:02.720 --> 01:08:03.840]   Everything's better.
[01:08:03.840 --> 01:08:08.000]   And they have rose gold on a couple of the platforms.
[01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:09.200]   What really jumped out?
[01:08:09.200 --> 01:08:11.160]   What was the biggest surprise of the event for you?
[01:08:11.160 --> 01:08:12.680]   How much I won an iPad Pro.
[01:08:12.680 --> 01:08:14.360]   I was not expecting to win an iPad Pro.
[01:08:14.360 --> 01:08:16.200]   Like, I went into this being like, yeah, whatever you guys.
[01:08:16.200 --> 01:08:17.360]   Like, I'm over the iPad.
[01:08:17.360 --> 01:08:18.240]   And I'm not over the iPad.
[01:08:18.240 --> 01:08:18.880]   I love my iPad.
[01:08:18.880 --> 01:08:21.800]   But I was not really expecting to be jazz.
[01:08:21.800 --> 01:08:24.840]   I was expecting to be really excited by the Apple TV.
[01:08:24.840 --> 01:08:27.360]   And look, maybe when the Apple TV service, which we know
[01:08:27.360 --> 01:08:30.440]   is going to come, comes out, that'll be amazing, right?
[01:08:30.440 --> 01:08:33.920]   But for right now, I'm really psyched about that iPad Pro.
[01:08:33.920 --> 01:08:36.280]   I mean, obviously, the Force touched up on the iPhone, too.
[01:08:36.280 --> 01:08:37.920]   I think those are the two big things.
[01:08:37.920 --> 01:08:38.840]   Or 3D touch, sorry.
[01:08:38.840 --> 01:08:42.160]   Not Force touch, 3D touch on the iPhone.
[01:08:42.160 --> 01:08:45.120]   And the iPad Pro, damn.
[01:08:45.120 --> 01:08:47.920]   I mean, they are doing some really interesting things.
[01:08:47.920 --> 01:08:50.760]   Yeah, Force touch sounds like some kind of creepy Star Wars
[01:08:50.760 --> 01:08:52.600]   porn parody or something like that.
[01:08:52.600 --> 01:08:53.600]   Now--
[01:08:53.600 --> 01:08:54.240]   It does.
[01:08:54.240 --> 01:08:54.500]   It does.
[01:08:54.500 --> 01:08:56.360]   3D touch this a little bit better.
[01:08:56.360 --> 01:08:57.880]   Yeah, it is significantly better.
[01:08:57.880 --> 01:09:00.960]   Now, Christina, you're like the third or fourth person
[01:09:00.960 --> 01:09:02.400]   who said exactly what you just said,
[01:09:02.400 --> 01:09:06.520]   which is that the surprise was how much you want the iPad Pro.
[01:09:06.520 --> 01:09:08.280]   Was it the pencil?
[01:09:08.280 --> 01:09:09.720]   Was it the speakers?
[01:09:09.720 --> 01:09:13.240]   What about the iPad Pro that they showed made you--
[01:09:13.240 --> 01:09:16.120]   So I think what it is is that we've kind of gone through this
[01:09:16.120 --> 01:09:17.840]   weird transition period with the iPad.
[01:09:17.840 --> 01:09:19.880]   And you and I have talked a lot about the Sun Tech news today.
[01:09:19.880 --> 01:09:22.040]   Tuna and every Friday to see me co-host with Mike.
[01:09:22.040 --> 01:09:24.440]   That's a plug for another Twitch show that works, right?
[01:09:24.440 --> 01:09:24.800]   Yep.
[01:09:24.800 --> 01:09:26.160]   OK, thanks.
[01:09:26.160 --> 01:09:31.080]   So well, we talked a lot about how first everyone underestimated
[01:09:31.080 --> 01:09:33.120]   the market for the iPad exponentially.
[01:09:33.120 --> 01:09:36.160]   And then it was successful and everyone overestimated the market.
[01:09:36.160 --> 01:09:37.440]   And then it sort of settled in.
[01:09:37.440 --> 01:09:39.160]   And I feel like what's happened.
[01:09:39.160 --> 01:09:40.880]   And we've seen this kind of trend
[01:09:40.880 --> 01:09:44.200]   is that the first use case of the iPad, which was basically
[01:09:44.200 --> 01:09:49.360]   as this bigger phone, this device that you use for play,
[01:09:49.360 --> 01:09:53.880]   frankly, this consumption device, that area, it's kind of over
[01:09:53.880 --> 01:09:55.680]   because the phones are so much bigger
[01:09:55.680 --> 01:09:57.120]   and you can do other stuff.
[01:09:57.120 --> 01:09:58.800]   And I mean, it's so great for that.
[01:09:58.800 --> 01:10:01.960]   But if I've got a 5 and 1/2 inch phone,
[01:10:01.960 --> 01:10:05.600]   I don't necessarily need a tablet to have my experiences
[01:10:05.600 --> 01:10:07.240]   kind of on the couch.
[01:10:07.240 --> 01:10:08.880]   I can have a new Apple TV for that.
[01:10:08.880 --> 01:10:11.120]   I can have my phone for that.
[01:10:11.120 --> 01:10:13.160]   So instead, what's starting to happen-- and Microsoft
[01:10:13.160 --> 01:10:15.920]   was honestly really ahead here with the Surface line--
[01:10:15.920 --> 01:10:18.360]   is that they are getting into the creation aspect.
[01:10:18.360 --> 01:10:20.120]   And I think this is the first time, especially
[01:10:20.120 --> 01:10:21.800]   seeing some of the apps they showed off,
[01:10:21.800 --> 01:10:26.760]   where you can actually say, this is a use case for this device.
[01:10:26.760 --> 01:10:28.280]   Because I kept asking myself, I was like,
[01:10:28.280 --> 01:10:30.400]   this thing with its powerful ads, it is.
[01:10:30.400 --> 01:10:32.880]   They're saying it's desktop class CPU, 80% faster
[01:10:32.880 --> 01:10:36.840]   than most portable PC sold last year, 90% faster graphics.
[01:10:36.840 --> 01:10:38.680]   I'm thinking, OK, so why is this not
[01:10:38.680 --> 01:10:39.520]   running OS 10?
[01:10:39.520 --> 01:10:41.200]   Why is this running iOS?
[01:10:41.200 --> 01:10:43.280]   And part of that, I think, comes down to,
[01:10:43.280 --> 01:10:44.720]   as you mentioned earlier, the stylus.
[01:10:44.720 --> 01:10:46.680]   I think the dual app mode, some of the other stuff.
[01:10:46.680 --> 01:10:48.200]   And just the fact that Touch frankly
[01:10:48.200 --> 01:10:49.760]   does add a different component.
[01:10:49.760 --> 01:10:52.000]   That's something I don't think Microsoft quite got right.
[01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:54.080]   They were early to realize we would
[01:10:54.080 --> 01:10:57.640]   want to use these tablet devices for real content creation.
[01:10:57.640 --> 01:11:00.120]   They missed the mark, I think, on getting the interface correct.
[01:11:00.120 --> 01:11:02.040]   So I think that having two separate interfaces still
[01:11:02.040 --> 01:11:03.000]   makes sense.
[01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:04.680]   But we're kind of entering into this era
[01:11:04.680 --> 01:11:08.000]   where maybe the future of computing, your next MacBook,
[01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:09.280]   will eventually be an iPad.
[01:11:09.280 --> 01:11:11.800]   And this is the first one I've seen that looks like it's
[01:11:11.800 --> 01:11:14.800]   going to bridge that gap.
[01:11:14.800 --> 01:11:16.400]   I absolutely agree with you there.
[01:11:16.400 --> 01:11:19.360]   And it's clear that Apple has been preparing for this transition
[01:11:19.360 --> 01:11:20.880]   for what?
[01:11:20.880 --> 01:11:22.480]   Six years now or something like that.
[01:11:22.480 --> 01:11:26.040]   I mean, it's really every new iteration of OS 10
[01:11:26.040 --> 01:11:27.560]   is more tably and touchy.
[01:11:27.560 --> 01:11:29.400]   But we're definitely getting there.
[01:11:29.400 --> 01:11:30.720]   No, we're definitely getting there.
[01:11:30.720 --> 01:11:32.080]   And I think that's what's so exciting.
[01:11:32.080 --> 01:11:34.120]   And then even seeing things like the stylus,
[01:11:34.120 --> 01:11:36.000]   I mean, Steve Jobs, everyone's going to make fun of it,
[01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:37.920]   including myself, who says, five years ago,
[01:11:37.920 --> 01:11:40.040]   he says, if you see a stylus, they blew it.
[01:11:40.040 --> 01:11:41.760]   Now they release an Apple console.
[01:11:41.760 --> 01:11:43.840]   But I will say that what they're doing with the stylus
[01:11:43.840 --> 01:11:45.760]   is what a lot of professionals have wanted them
[01:11:45.760 --> 01:11:49.000]   to do for a long time, including Adobe, who was on stage.
[01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:51.960]   I remember meeting with Adobe when they were still doing--
[01:11:51.960 --> 01:11:54.880]   what's the name of the two hardware devices
[01:11:54.880 --> 01:11:55.880]   they released for the iPad?
[01:11:55.880 --> 01:11:58.920]   They released the slide and rule, I guess.
[01:11:58.920 --> 01:11:59.960]   I can't remember what they were called.
[01:11:59.960 --> 01:12:02.840]   But they released a stylus that they did with Adronit.
[01:12:02.840 --> 01:12:05.720]   And they did a ruler sort of thing.
[01:12:05.720 --> 01:12:10.320]   And when I talk to them, people from the Adobe Labs X team--
[01:12:10.320 --> 01:12:12.320]   Adobe X team, I think, is what they were called.
[01:12:12.320 --> 01:12:13.680]   This was a couple of years ago.
[01:12:13.680 --> 01:12:15.320]   They talked about the fact that they really
[01:12:15.320 --> 01:12:18.440]   wanted to be able to do this additional detail on the iPad,
[01:12:18.440 --> 01:12:20.600]   because so many artists were using those tools.
[01:12:20.600 --> 01:12:22.720]   But they were limited because they didn't have the hardware
[01:12:22.720 --> 01:12:23.440]   access.
[01:12:23.440 --> 01:12:24.720]   And so what this is letting them do
[01:12:24.720 --> 01:12:26.440]   is that Adobe doesn't have to make the stylus.
[01:12:26.440 --> 01:12:28.440]   But they can make software that can support the stylus
[01:12:28.440 --> 01:12:29.800]   and do amazing things.
[01:12:29.800 --> 01:12:32.680]   And that's opening up things that you wouldn't use a stylus
[01:12:32.680 --> 01:12:34.240]   for in the traditional context.
[01:12:34.240 --> 01:12:36.320]   And Steve Jobs was saying, if you see a stylus,
[01:12:36.320 --> 01:12:36.800]   they blew it.
[01:12:36.800 --> 01:12:42.000]   He meant in the 1.0 tablet era of the Windows XP tablets,
[01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:44.840]   or the Palm Pilot or the Trio.
[01:12:44.840 --> 01:12:47.760]   He didn't mean, in the context, I don't think,
[01:12:47.760 --> 01:12:51.320]   of if you're wanting to do really pressure sensitive artwork,
[01:12:51.320 --> 01:12:53.440]   and you're wanting to do really specific modeling,
[01:12:53.440 --> 01:12:55.880]   or yes, maybe as Microsoft loves to show off
[01:12:55.880 --> 01:12:57.400]   with the service taking notes.
[01:12:57.400 --> 01:12:59.760]   Although what's interesting is I tried the Palm detection.
[01:12:59.760 --> 01:13:00.720]   It was really good.
[01:13:00.720 --> 01:13:02.560]   And I think it would be fine for writing notes on it.
[01:13:02.560 --> 01:13:03.960]   But really, it's going to be one of those things,
[01:13:03.960 --> 01:13:06.120]   I think, for people who primarily use their iPad
[01:13:06.120 --> 01:13:07.160]   to create stuff.
[01:13:07.160 --> 01:13:09.120]   But I could also see, especially with some of the stuff
[01:13:09.120 --> 01:13:13.280]   built into the Apple Pencil, along the lines of doing video
[01:13:13.280 --> 01:13:15.720]   editing and doing photo editing, in a way
[01:13:15.720 --> 01:13:17.880]   that you wouldn't expect to do it beforehand.
[01:13:17.880 --> 01:13:20.040]   So again, I think that that's kind of why it makes sense
[01:13:20.040 --> 01:13:21.720]   for them to have this now, because they're not
[01:13:21.720 --> 01:13:23.360]   kind of finally closing that loop.
[01:13:23.360 --> 01:13:26.120]   And that conversion device that we've-- a lot of us,
[01:13:26.120 --> 01:13:28.800]   one of the original iPad to be five years ago--
[01:13:28.800 --> 01:13:31.120]   is kind of here now.
[01:13:31.120 --> 01:13:31.760]   Absolutely.
[01:13:31.760 --> 01:13:33.360]   Well, I'm going to let you go, Christina.
[01:13:33.360 --> 01:13:34.360]   Thank you so much for joining us.
[01:13:34.360 --> 01:13:36.360]   Can I ask your question really quick?
[01:13:36.360 --> 01:13:37.280]   Go for it.
[01:13:37.280 --> 01:13:39.360]   Sorry, there's a question I couldn't ask Carrie.
[01:13:39.360 --> 01:13:41.640]   So Christina, I have my purse right here,
[01:13:41.640 --> 01:13:44.160]   and I carry my iPad in it, and I take it to the gym
[01:13:44.160 --> 01:13:45.960]   to watch my version of TV.
[01:13:45.960 --> 01:13:48.560]   Am I going to be able to do that with a 12-inch iPad
[01:13:48.560 --> 01:13:50.600]   Pro, 12.9?
[01:13:50.600 --> 01:13:53.160]   Not unless you have a really big back.
[01:13:53.160 --> 01:13:54.120]   It is thin enough.
[01:13:54.120 --> 01:13:56.240]   But because it's 12.9 inches, I mean,
[01:13:56.240 --> 01:13:57.720]   you would really need a laptop back.
[01:13:57.720 --> 01:14:01.920]   It's a little bit bigger than the MacBook, the new MacBook,
[01:14:01.920 --> 01:14:02.800]   from what it seems like.
[01:14:02.800 --> 01:14:05.200]   So if you can fit the new MacBook in your purse,
[01:14:05.200 --> 01:14:06.760]   then you might be OK.
[01:14:06.760 --> 01:14:09.240]   But for realistically speaking, probably not.
[01:14:09.240 --> 01:14:12.240]   But this is a great excuse to buy a new back.
[01:14:12.240 --> 01:14:14.680]   And that's all we really care about, right?
[01:14:14.680 --> 01:14:16.280]   It's going to be Apple's next business.
[01:14:16.280 --> 01:14:16.960]   Honestly, right?
[01:14:16.960 --> 01:14:19.360]   I mean, that's what-- totally.
[01:14:19.360 --> 01:14:21.320]   Yeah, this is an excuse to buy a new back.
[01:14:21.320 --> 01:14:23.400]   And again, we have pink phones, you guys.
[01:14:23.400 --> 01:14:24.320]   We have pink iPhones.
[01:14:24.320 --> 01:14:26.360]   That's really all anybody needs to take away from this pink
[01:14:26.360 --> 01:14:26.560]   iPhone.
[01:14:26.560 --> 01:14:27.560]   And pink straps as well.
[01:14:27.560 --> 01:14:30.080]   Now, Christina, Warren, you live in Brooklyn,
[01:14:30.080 --> 01:14:31.560]   so you're unfamiliar with good pizza.
[01:14:31.560 --> 01:14:34.000]   So you should go to pizza at the 211 in San Francisco.
[01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:35.280]   And now that you're in California,
[01:14:35.280 --> 01:14:36.360]   you can have some real pizza.
[01:14:36.360 --> 01:14:41.160]   You watch your mouth.
[01:14:41.160 --> 01:14:42.720]   You watch your mouth.
[01:14:42.720 --> 01:14:43.960]   But I will check that out.
[01:14:43.960 --> 01:14:44.560]   Thank you, Mike.
[01:14:44.560 --> 01:14:45.920]   All right, well, have fun at XOXO.
[01:14:45.920 --> 01:14:48.120]   I know you're headed up there to Oregon.
[01:14:48.120 --> 01:14:50.080]   Christina Warren is a Mashable Senior Tech correspondent
[01:14:50.080 --> 01:14:52.800]   and co-anchor on Friday on Tech News Today.
[01:14:52.800 --> 01:14:56.840]   Thanks for taking the time to talk to us today, Christina.
[01:14:56.840 --> 01:14:57.960]   Of course, bye, Mike.
[01:14:57.960 --> 01:14:59.480]   Bye, guys.
[01:14:59.480 --> 01:15:01.520]   All right, Christina Warren.
[01:15:01.520 --> 01:15:03.360]   OK, so I think we can pretty much wrap up
[01:15:03.360 --> 01:15:04.960]   the coverage of the show itself.
[01:15:04.960 --> 01:15:06.760]   Great event, lots of great products.
[01:15:06.760 --> 01:15:08.680]   Proof is in the putting on some of this stuff.
[01:15:08.680 --> 01:15:12.240]   We really don't know what the Apple TV is going to be all about.
[01:15:12.240 --> 01:15:15.080]   Until the apps come out, we really don't know what the iPhone--
[01:15:15.080 --> 01:15:16.640]   I'm sure the iPhone would be fantastic.
[01:15:16.640 --> 01:15:20.160]   I mean, we don't know how much better the camera will be.
[01:15:20.160 --> 01:15:22.360]   It'd probably be significantly better.
[01:15:22.360 --> 01:15:25.160]   And of course, the iPad Pro is the big surprise of the day.
[01:15:25.160 --> 01:15:27.360]   People seem to like it much more than they thought they would.
[01:15:27.360 --> 01:15:29.160]   And the Apple Watch is still the Apple Watch.
[01:15:29.160 --> 01:15:30.080]   And now there's a pink one.
[01:15:30.080 --> 01:15:31.840]   And I think that, of course, one of the next things
[01:15:31.840 --> 01:15:35.040]   will be is to see how this quarter turns out financially.
[01:15:35.040 --> 01:15:36.720]   They're going to be going into the quarter
[01:15:36.720 --> 01:15:37.640]   with a full head of steam.
[01:15:37.640 --> 01:15:42.440]   It's interesting to see how they book sales on the $32
[01:15:42.440 --> 01:15:46.080]   a month from a financial perspective.
[01:15:46.080 --> 01:15:48.320]   But it'll be interesting to see if they
[01:15:48.320 --> 01:15:53.840]   can beat last year's number, which would be almost impossible.
[01:15:53.840 --> 01:15:54.560]   Almost impossible.
[01:15:54.560 --> 01:15:55.680]   They really need China.
[01:15:55.680 --> 01:15:58.040]   And China is having financial--
[01:15:58.040 --> 01:16:01.600]   their economy is in a doldrum period right now.
[01:16:01.600 --> 01:16:04.200]   And people are cutting back on their pricey--
[01:16:04.200 --> 01:16:07.280]   Well, I think it's not that people cutting on the pricey things.
[01:16:07.280 --> 01:16:08.840]   People are not buying chotskis.
[01:16:08.840 --> 01:16:10.120]   They're buying apps.
[01:16:10.120 --> 01:16:12.280]   I think that is a huge piece of what
[01:16:12.280 --> 01:16:15.520]   is starting to dig into China, is that we're not
[01:16:15.520 --> 01:16:16.840]   buying a bunch of stuff that we don't need,
[01:16:16.840 --> 01:16:18.880]   because that's what apps are for,
[01:16:18.880 --> 01:16:21.240]   is a bunch of little things that we don't need.
[01:16:21.240 --> 01:16:26.080]   And I think that is going to continue to be a problem in China
[01:16:26.080 --> 01:16:29.120]   is that people aren't buying the cheap stuff
[01:16:29.120 --> 01:16:30.400]   that they were buying before.
[01:16:30.400 --> 01:16:32.000]   There was just so much expensive stuff from China,
[01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:32.920]   but just not the cheap stuff.
[01:16:32.920 --> 01:16:34.680]   Thanks for using the word stuff.
[01:16:34.680 --> 01:16:36.920]   Mike, maybe you talked about this before I got on.
[01:16:36.920 --> 01:16:40.080]   But one single thing that was really missing for me
[01:16:40.080 --> 01:16:42.560]   was no home kid in the Apple TV.
[01:16:42.560 --> 01:16:44.160]   Did you guys already talk about that?
[01:16:44.160 --> 01:16:44.640]   It's interesting.
[01:16:44.640 --> 01:16:45.480]   That is really interesting.
[01:16:45.480 --> 01:16:46.720]   I was expecting something there.
[01:16:46.720 --> 01:16:49.840]   And by the middle of it, I stopped thinking about it.
[01:16:49.840 --> 01:16:52.760]   The distortion field had affected me.
[01:16:52.760 --> 01:16:55.680]   But I was expecting some more talk of home kid.
[01:16:55.680 --> 01:16:58.080]   I think they just haven't had as much traction as they expected.
[01:16:58.080 --> 01:16:58.400]   Yeah.
[01:16:58.400 --> 01:16:59.960]   Well, I'm wondering whether it's going to be in there
[01:16:59.960 --> 01:17:01.280]   and they just haven't talked about it yet,
[01:17:01.280 --> 01:17:02.520]   because they've got some time, right?
[01:17:02.520 --> 01:17:03.440]   I forget what the delivery is.
[01:17:03.440 --> 01:17:06.160]   That's the one that's in November.
[01:17:06.160 --> 01:17:08.000]   It's a ways out.
[01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:09.840]   No one or they pro is in November.
[01:17:09.840 --> 01:17:11.000]   I've got so many notes here.
[01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:11.640]   I've lost track.
[01:17:11.640 --> 01:17:14.280]   But yeah, I really, really wanted that.
[01:17:14.280 --> 01:17:17.680]   We've been waiting to jump into the whole home automation
[01:17:17.680 --> 01:17:19.880]   stuff until we had that centralized hub.
[01:17:19.880 --> 01:17:22.040]   Remember everybody said it was all going to be Siri,
[01:17:22.040 --> 01:17:23.120]   you know, these week.
[01:17:23.120 --> 01:17:24.720]   I want that now.
[01:17:24.720 --> 01:17:25.240]   Absolutely.
[01:17:25.240 --> 01:17:26.240]   I want that too.
[01:17:26.240 --> 01:17:26.480]   All right.
[01:17:26.480 --> 01:17:27.600]   Well, we're going to take a break.
[01:17:27.600 --> 01:17:31.400]   And when we come back, we're going to do our picks, et cetera,
[01:17:31.400 --> 01:17:32.760]   and then wrap up the show.
[01:17:32.760 --> 01:17:33.920]   But first, let's talk about Harry's.
[01:17:33.920 --> 01:17:35.240]   Let's talk about a really great shave.
[01:17:35.240 --> 01:17:37.360]   You know, one of the reasons that those of us who use Apple
[01:17:37.360 --> 01:17:39.800]   products-- and of course, I guilty as charge.
[01:17:39.800 --> 01:17:41.800]   I give Apple so much of my income.
[01:17:41.800 --> 01:17:44.000]   It's not even funny.
[01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:46.320]   One of the reasons is that they're beautifully designed.
[01:17:46.320 --> 01:17:48.400]   Everyday objects should be beautifully designed.
[01:17:48.400 --> 01:17:50.520]   In fact, I think that's more important to me
[01:17:50.520 --> 01:17:53.120]   than artwork that I hang on the wall.
[01:17:53.120 --> 01:17:56.640]   Everything that I use in my life should be as well designed
[01:17:56.640 --> 01:18:00.240]   as it possibly can be fully functional, high performance.
[01:18:00.240 --> 01:18:01.560]   And that's what Harry's is all about.
[01:18:01.560 --> 01:18:03.080]   They make these razors.
[01:18:03.080 --> 01:18:04.120]   It's a razor blade.
[01:18:04.120 --> 01:18:09.640]   They're entering this industry where the products are ugly,
[01:18:09.640 --> 01:18:12.560]   awkward to use, vastly overpriced,
[01:18:12.560 --> 01:18:14.200]   because of monopoly pricing.
[01:18:14.200 --> 01:18:16.640]   And with Harry's, they've cut through all that.
[01:18:16.640 --> 01:18:20.240]   They're basically going into an industry where
[01:18:20.240 --> 01:18:21.880]   razors are $4 a blade.
[01:18:21.880 --> 01:18:24.920]   And they're selling you razor blades for much, much less
[01:18:24.920 --> 01:18:25.240]   than that.
[01:18:25.240 --> 01:18:27.880]   And the razor blades, the razors themselves,
[01:18:27.880 --> 01:18:31.440]   the handles, the look and feel is very minimalist, very kind
[01:18:31.440 --> 01:18:32.800]   of applesque, really.
[01:18:32.800 --> 01:18:34.320]   They're really nicely designed.
[01:18:34.320 --> 01:18:36.880]   And it's a joy to shave every morning.
[01:18:36.880 --> 01:18:37.920]   You don't have to walk up to someone
[01:18:37.920 --> 01:18:40.160]   and ride aid and ask them to unlock the razor.
[01:18:40.160 --> 01:18:40.880]   That's right.
[01:18:40.880 --> 01:18:42.440]   They have the security gobble key.
[01:18:42.440 --> 01:18:43.920]   And they call the manager and stuff.
[01:18:43.920 --> 01:18:44.920]   This guy has a beard.
[01:18:44.920 --> 01:18:46.280]   And we got to do something about it.
[01:18:46.280 --> 01:18:47.440]   Please come to the front.
[01:18:47.440 --> 01:18:48.640]   Yeah, none of that stuff.
[01:18:48.640 --> 01:18:50.520]   This is just going to come right to your door
[01:18:50.520 --> 01:18:52.520]   in a beautiful minimalist box.
[01:18:52.520 --> 01:18:54.720]   The starter Truman set, for example, is an amazing deal.
[01:18:54.720 --> 01:18:58.360]   You get all of it for $15 that comes with the shaving gel.
[01:18:58.360 --> 01:19:01.840]   You get the razor with the handle and three razor blades.
[01:19:01.840 --> 01:19:06.280]   And $15, for what you get, that is just an amazing price.
[01:19:06.280 --> 01:19:09.360]   And the thing that you can't really
[01:19:09.360 --> 01:19:14.120]   convey over the medium media of video and audio
[01:19:14.120 --> 01:19:15.720]   is just how great this stuff smells.
[01:19:15.720 --> 01:19:17.960]   It's like really pleasant stuff to use.
[01:19:17.960 --> 01:19:20.320]   And I really, really recommend it.
[01:19:20.320 --> 01:19:23.640]   It's just-- I use Harry's every single day.
[01:19:23.640 --> 01:19:25.920]   It's just so fantastic every single day.
[01:19:25.920 --> 01:19:26.920]   Just go to harries.com.
[01:19:26.920 --> 01:19:30.120]   That's h-a-r-r-y-s.com.
[01:19:30.120 --> 01:19:32.000]   And you get $5 off your first purchase.
[01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:33.320]   Just use the code MACBRAKE.
[01:19:33.320 --> 01:19:35.440]   If you don't use MACBRAKE as the code,
[01:19:35.440 --> 01:19:37.040]   you won't get the $5 off.
[01:19:37.040 --> 01:19:39.400]   So use MACBRAKE and get $5 off.
[01:19:39.400 --> 01:19:41.960]   That's h-a-r-r-y-s.com.
[01:19:41.960 --> 01:19:43.680]   Enter the code MACBRAKE at checkout.
[01:19:43.680 --> 01:19:46.720]   And we thank Harry's for their support of MACBRAKE Weekly.
[01:19:46.720 --> 01:19:49.320]   And I thank Harry's for this beautiful face
[01:19:49.320 --> 01:19:51.320]   in front of my head.
[01:19:51.320 --> 01:19:52.320]   It's very beautiful.
[01:19:52.320 --> 01:19:52.760]   Thank you.
[01:19:52.760 --> 01:19:54.320]   Yes, I thank you.
[01:19:54.320 --> 01:19:56.320]   Didn't ask for a second opinion, but thank you.
[01:19:56.320 --> 01:19:57.880]   It's very, very nice of you to say.
[01:19:57.880 --> 01:20:00.520]   So let's talk about a couple of-- very quickly--
[01:20:00.520 --> 01:20:02.720]   one or two things in the news.
[01:20:02.720 --> 01:20:04.040]   There are other things in the news.
[01:20:04.040 --> 01:20:05.800]   One of them is that Apple's ramping up a tiring
[01:20:05.800 --> 01:20:07.120]   of artificial intelligence.
[01:20:07.120 --> 01:20:09.880]   We referenced this during the live stream.
[01:20:09.880 --> 01:20:11.600]   This is no doubt for Siri.
[01:20:11.600 --> 01:20:12.600]   It's for Apple TV.
[01:20:12.600 --> 01:20:14.520]   It's for all the things, all the cloud services.
[01:20:14.520 --> 01:20:16.520]   And also driverless cars.
[01:20:16.520 --> 01:20:19.920]   Machine learning is a lot of it's going to be figuring out
[01:20:19.920 --> 01:20:21.120]   what has to go in front of it.
[01:20:21.120 --> 01:20:21.600]   Yeah.
[01:20:21.600 --> 01:20:23.320]   And the news came from Reuters.
[01:20:23.320 --> 01:20:26.560]   It was an exclusive by Julia Love, I believe.
[01:20:26.560 --> 01:20:32.120]   And basically, the news is that Apple's actually tripled
[01:20:32.120 --> 01:20:33.000]   or quadrupled.
[01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:34.240]   They're not sure exactly.
[01:20:34.240 --> 01:20:38.320]   They're hiring of AI experts in the last couple of years.
[01:20:38.320 --> 01:20:39.520]   And they're really ramping it up.
[01:20:39.520 --> 01:20:40.840]   And it's a tough competitive market,
[01:20:40.840 --> 01:20:42.000]   because Facebook wants them.
[01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:43.320]   Google wants them.
[01:20:43.320 --> 01:20:44.040]   Amazon wants them.
[01:20:44.040 --> 01:20:46.000]   Everybody wants these AI scientists,
[01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:47.840]   because that's where everything is going.
[01:20:47.840 --> 01:20:50.120]   All these beautiful devices we're going to be using
[01:20:50.120 --> 01:20:52.200]   are going to be powered by cloud-based AI,
[01:20:52.200 --> 01:20:54.160]   artificial intelligence using machine learning
[01:20:54.160 --> 01:20:56.520]   and all these other advanced technologies.
[01:20:56.520 --> 01:21:01.000]   It's going to be a wonderful/freaky world.
[01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:02.240]   Don't let them talk to each other.
[01:21:02.240 --> 01:21:04.200]   Everyone keeps on talking about letting the machines talk
[01:21:04.200 --> 01:21:04.920]   to the other machines.
[01:21:04.920 --> 01:21:06.480]   I don't think there's collusion there.
[01:21:06.480 --> 01:21:07.640]   I think we're going to be careful.
[01:21:07.640 --> 01:21:08.120]   Because then it's--
[01:21:08.120 --> 01:21:10.160]   Isn't Stephen Hawking tell us not to do this?
[01:21:10.160 --> 01:21:12.040]   He told us this was really dangerous?
[01:21:12.040 --> 01:21:12.560]   He did.
[01:21:12.560 --> 01:21:13.080]   He did.
[01:21:13.080 --> 01:21:13.760]   He's the little smart guy.
[01:21:13.760 --> 01:21:14.800]   We should probably listen to him.
[01:21:14.800 --> 01:21:15.800]   Yeah.
[01:21:15.800 --> 01:21:16.680]   It's a good point.
[01:21:16.680 --> 01:21:19.680]   And I think Elon Musk is also one of the publicly freaked out
[01:21:19.680 --> 01:21:21.440]   about AI people.
[01:21:21.440 --> 01:21:22.800]   Yeah, those guys are idiots.
[01:21:22.800 --> 01:21:23.600]   So what do they know?
[01:21:23.600 --> 01:21:25.320]   They're a bunch of idiots, just because he has a space program
[01:21:25.320 --> 01:21:27.320]   and an innovative car company doesn't mean he knows
[01:21:27.320 --> 01:21:28.160]   what he's talking about.
[01:21:28.160 --> 01:21:32.600]   All right, so why don't we go to our picks of the week.
[01:21:32.600 --> 01:21:34.080]   Alex, do you have a pick of the week?
[01:21:34.080 --> 01:21:36.600]   And dude, now I've been playing nice for quite some time.
[01:21:36.600 --> 01:21:41.160]   And I've been mostly doing consumer things that are $2 or $3.
[01:21:41.160 --> 01:21:44.960]   And every once in a while, I have another side of me.
[01:21:44.960 --> 01:21:48.360]   So anyway, so this is a pro app.
[01:21:48.360 --> 01:21:49.440]   A lot of you won't use it.
[01:21:49.440 --> 01:21:52.240]   But for those of you who do do production,
[01:21:52.240 --> 01:21:54.160]   who happen to be a little watching Mac break,
[01:21:54.160 --> 01:21:56.720]   this is a very useful thing to know it exists.
[01:21:56.720 --> 01:21:57.840]   It's by Clearcom.
[01:21:57.840 --> 01:22:00.440]   Now, Clearcom makes a lot of-- we buy a lot of comms,
[01:22:00.440 --> 01:22:01.640]   systems from Clearcom.
[01:22:01.640 --> 01:22:05.280]   So they make the little headsets that you ready camera to,
[01:22:05.280 --> 01:22:06.880]   go camera to, you know, that type of thing.
[01:22:06.880 --> 01:22:07.440]   Yeah.
[01:22:07.440 --> 01:22:10.480]   And they have finally rolled out their, what's
[01:22:10.480 --> 01:22:12.760]   called, Agent IC, which is a--
[01:22:12.760 --> 01:22:13.800]   and I won't be able to get it here,
[01:22:13.800 --> 01:22:14.880]   because it's not on the right network.
[01:22:14.880 --> 01:22:20.000]   But what it does is it basically can tie your iPhone or iPad
[01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:21.440]   into your comm system.
[01:22:21.440 --> 01:22:22.720]   So you have all the power.
[01:22:22.720 --> 01:22:25.800]   And now these boxes that we buy, and we've got quite a few
[01:22:25.800 --> 01:22:27.880]   of them, are $2,000 or $3,000 each.
[01:22:27.880 --> 01:22:29.840]   And then you just have your iPhone do it, walk around,
[01:22:29.840 --> 01:22:31.200]   and talk to people.
[01:22:31.200 --> 01:22:33.920]   And anyway, it's $250.
[01:22:33.920 --> 01:22:35.640]   It's an expensive app.
[01:22:35.640 --> 01:22:37.480]   It's free to download, just to get it to work.
[01:22:37.480 --> 01:22:39.240]   It's $50.
[01:22:39.240 --> 01:22:41.160]   And so you go up here and it'll be like whatever.
[01:22:41.160 --> 01:22:43.120]   It's like something plus, and you download it, and you're like,
[01:22:43.120 --> 01:22:44.600]   this is cool, and it doesn't do anything.
[01:22:44.600 --> 01:22:48.280]   So once you have the IP, and for instance, our comm system,
[01:22:48.280 --> 01:22:49.400]   we have what's called an eclipse,
[01:22:49.400 --> 01:22:51.840]   and it'll tie into public IP.
[01:22:51.840 --> 01:22:54.360]   And when we give it that static, it
[01:22:54.360 --> 01:22:56.600]   can just find it from anywhere in the world, which means
[01:22:56.600 --> 01:22:59.520]   that you can tie all your friends in.
[01:22:59.520 --> 01:23:05.720]   So if you're doing semi-pro-production,
[01:23:05.720 --> 01:23:07.000]   we give our stamp of approval.
[01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:07.840]   It sounds really good.
[01:23:07.840 --> 01:23:10.440]   It works well, which we didn't expect it to.
[01:23:10.440 --> 01:23:13.480]   So you can see some of the stuff you can push and talk
[01:23:13.480 --> 01:23:14.480]   to people.
[01:23:14.480 --> 01:23:17.920]   And anyway, it took them a long time to get to it,
[01:23:17.920 --> 01:23:19.240]   but it works really well.
[01:23:19.240 --> 01:23:20.200]   And that's cool.
[01:23:20.200 --> 01:23:20.680]   That's it.
[01:23:20.680 --> 01:23:21.760]   That's very cool.
[01:23:21.760 --> 01:23:24.200]   I wish now I wish I did that for a living.
[01:23:24.200 --> 01:23:25.200]   I could get this.
[01:23:25.200 --> 01:23:26.480]   That's really cool.
[01:23:26.480 --> 01:23:28.760]   Alison, do you have a pick of the week?
[01:23:28.760 --> 01:23:29.360]   I do.
[01:23:29.360 --> 01:23:32.480]   And Alex has reviewed a couple of things like this in the past.
[01:23:32.480 --> 01:23:33.640]   I don't think you've done this one.
[01:23:33.640 --> 01:23:36.760]   This is the Houtu trip mate TMO5.
[01:23:36.760 --> 01:23:40.080]   It's a 10,400 milliamp hour battery, so big deal.
[01:23:40.080 --> 01:23:44.280]   But it's also got a-- it's got gigabit ethernet,
[01:23:44.280 --> 01:23:45.680]   and it's a router.
[01:23:45.680 --> 01:23:49.320]   It's a bridge 2.1 amp--
[01:23:49.320 --> 01:23:52.280]   I'm sorry-- 2.1 amp USB port.
[01:23:52.280 --> 01:23:54.080]   And this thing works really great.
[01:23:54.080 --> 01:23:57.480]   You can hook up a USB hub to it and put a bunch of junk on it,
[01:23:57.480 --> 01:23:59.960]   but you can use it as a media server,
[01:23:59.960 --> 01:24:01.560]   keep the kids entertained in the car.
[01:24:01.560 --> 01:24:02.480]   And it's--
[01:24:02.480 --> 01:24:04.240]   It has storage as well?
[01:24:04.240 --> 01:24:05.280]   No, no.
[01:24:05.280 --> 01:24:06.760]   But it's got a USB port.
[01:24:06.760 --> 01:24:07.240]   Right, right.
[01:24:07.240 --> 01:24:08.280]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:24:08.280 --> 01:24:09.600]   Plug anything you want.
[01:24:09.600 --> 01:24:15.640]   It does have to be formatted FAT32 or FAT something else,
[01:24:15.640 --> 01:24:18.720]   the higher fats, which kind of messed it up for me
[01:24:18.720 --> 01:24:20.800]   because all my movies are on an NTFS drive.
[01:24:20.800 --> 01:24:23.320]   But I reformatted some to test it.
[01:24:23.320 --> 01:24:24.080]   It'll do music.
[01:24:24.080 --> 01:24:25.040]   It'll do videos.
[01:24:25.040 --> 01:24:26.920]   It'll do photos.
[01:24:26.920 --> 01:24:29.840]   And it's only $60 at Amazon.
[01:24:29.840 --> 01:24:33.320]   So I just-- why not, right?
[01:24:33.320 --> 01:24:34.080]   It's not indeed.
[01:24:34.080 --> 01:24:36.480]   You know, I have a couple of the Houtu routers.
[01:24:36.480 --> 01:24:37.440]   I don't have that one.
[01:24:37.440 --> 01:24:38.160]   I haven't seen that one.
[01:24:38.160 --> 01:24:39.400]   That one looks great.
[01:24:39.400 --> 01:24:40.000]   And they work great.
[01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:41.560]   I think it's new.
[01:24:41.560 --> 01:24:43.920]   Yeah, I had the TMO4.
[01:24:43.920 --> 01:24:48.920]   And the only downside is it's a 2.4 gigahertz device.
[01:24:48.920 --> 01:24:51.840]   So I've got to combine 2.4 and 5 gigahertz network.
[01:24:51.840 --> 01:24:54.200]   And I, for the life of me, couldn't get the TMO4
[01:24:54.200 --> 01:24:55.800]   to connect to my network.
[01:24:55.800 --> 01:24:57.120]   Their support was great.
[01:24:57.120 --> 01:24:59.320]   They were really good talking to me, helping me try to figure it out.
[01:24:59.320 --> 01:25:00.200]   They couldn't figure it out.
[01:25:00.200 --> 01:25:01.720]   So they sent me the TMO5.
[01:25:01.720 --> 01:25:02.640]   And it didn't work either.
[01:25:02.640 --> 01:25:04.480]   And that's when I realized it was my bad.
[01:25:04.480 --> 01:25:06.440]   And once I separated my networks,
[01:25:06.440 --> 01:25:09.560]   I could connect it up to 2.4 to extend my network.
[01:25:09.560 --> 01:25:11.520]   And then I could recombine the networks
[01:25:11.520 --> 01:25:12.800]   and it would find the right one.
[01:25:12.800 --> 01:25:14.920]   But that is one thing just to keep an eye out for,
[01:25:14.920 --> 01:25:16.600]   just to make sure if it doesn't work for you,
[01:25:16.600 --> 01:25:19.000]   it's probably because you're not on 2.4 gigahertz.
[01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:20.680]   But it works right now.
[01:25:20.680 --> 01:25:21.440]   That's cool.
[01:25:21.440 --> 01:25:22.320]   They work really well.
[01:25:22.320 --> 01:25:23.560]   I mean, the other ones-- and so I'm
[01:25:23.560 --> 01:25:24.720]   sure that this one works great.
[01:25:24.720 --> 01:25:25.560]   It's good technology.
[01:25:25.560 --> 01:25:26.080]   Yeah.
[01:25:26.080 --> 01:25:27.880]   Yeah, I think they discontinued--
[01:25:27.880 --> 01:25:28.840]   you may have seen this one.
[01:25:28.840 --> 01:25:30.680]   This was the TMO4.
[01:25:30.680 --> 01:25:31.720]   That's what I hope.
[01:25:31.720 --> 01:25:34.640]   Yeah, they discontinued that one and came out with the TMO5.
[01:25:34.640 --> 01:25:37.240]   It doesn't have a little outlet thingy on it.
[01:25:37.240 --> 01:25:39.520]   But you're always in a different country anyway, Alex.
[01:25:39.520 --> 01:25:40.920]   You know, that would actually--
[01:25:40.920 --> 01:25:42.440]   I think the TMO5 would be better.
[01:25:42.440 --> 01:25:44.840]   So I might have to upgrade.
[01:25:44.840 --> 01:25:45.360]   Awesome.
[01:25:45.360 --> 01:25:46.680]   Well, thank you so much for that.
[01:25:46.680 --> 01:25:48.600]   My pick of the week is the--
[01:25:48.600 --> 01:25:50.320]   we're talking about this new feature
[01:25:50.320 --> 01:25:54.160]   that Apple has where you basically take a picture.
[01:25:54.160 --> 01:25:55.200]   And it's actually the default--
[01:25:55.200 --> 01:25:58.160]   I'm kind of surprised that it's the default, actually.
[01:25:58.160 --> 01:25:59.720]   But it's called Live Photos.
[01:25:59.720 --> 01:26:01.760]   And you take a picture and it will
[01:26:01.760 --> 01:26:04.800]   capture the moment before the picture was taken,
[01:26:04.800 --> 01:26:05.600]   the moment after.
[01:26:05.600 --> 01:26:08.880]   And then when you use it for your lock screen
[01:26:08.880 --> 01:26:11.360]   or you post it somewhere, it'll just be a picture
[01:26:11.360 --> 01:26:13.480]   until you touch it or click on or whatever.
[01:26:13.480 --> 01:26:15.080]   And then you'll get the little video.
[01:26:15.080 --> 01:26:18.480]   So there's something psychologically appealing
[01:26:18.480 --> 01:26:21.960]   about still photos that have subtle motion or interactive
[01:26:21.960 --> 01:26:23.160]   motion.
[01:26:23.160 --> 01:26:25.120]   It's not a vine video that you watch
[01:26:25.120 --> 01:26:27.000]   from beginning to end that tells a story or whatever.
[01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:30.080]   It's just like a still life with the smoke coming off
[01:26:30.080 --> 01:26:33.080]   of your coffee or a still life with subtle movement.
[01:26:33.080 --> 01:26:35.040]   And one of the great ways to do that
[01:26:35.040 --> 01:26:37.640]   is called a cinemagraph, which is where most of the--
[01:26:37.640 --> 01:26:39.920]   it's a still photo, most of the photo.
[01:26:39.920 --> 01:26:43.280]   And then there's something in the picture that moves subtly.
[01:26:43.280 --> 01:26:45.920]   And you can make beautiful ones with Cinemagraph Pro
[01:26:45.920 --> 01:26:48.120]   for Mac from Flixel.
[01:26:48.120 --> 01:26:50.440]   And this is, of course, you can download Free Trial,
[01:26:50.440 --> 01:26:54.680]   but this is a Mac app application that won an Apple Design
[01:26:54.680 --> 01:26:56.600]   Award in 2014.
[01:26:56.600 --> 01:27:00.400]   So if you really want to get into this and explore this world
[01:27:00.400 --> 01:27:03.680]   of still photos that have subtle motion, a cinemagraph,
[01:27:03.680 --> 01:27:05.200]   I don't think they ever go out of style.
[01:27:05.200 --> 01:27:06.160]   They're really beautiful.
[01:27:06.160 --> 01:27:08.920]   And of course, you can post them all over the place.
[01:27:08.920 --> 01:27:09.840]   And that's really nice.
[01:27:09.840 --> 01:27:14.160]   An Apple Design winner in 2014.
[01:27:14.160 --> 01:27:14.680]   Mmm.
[01:27:14.680 --> 01:27:16.240]   Connected?
[01:27:16.240 --> 01:27:17.840]   I think not.
[01:27:17.840 --> 01:27:19.040]   All right, well, there it is.
[01:27:19.040 --> 01:27:24.560]   And I personally think that this is a really, really great
[01:27:24.560 --> 01:27:25.240]   announcement.
[01:27:25.240 --> 01:27:28.960]   I love it when companies have something really solid.
[01:27:28.960 --> 01:27:31.160]   And they just keep aggressively improving
[01:27:31.160 --> 01:27:32.600]   every aspect of it.
[01:27:32.600 --> 01:27:35.200]   And this is a case, I think, with especially with the iPhone.
[01:27:35.200 --> 01:27:36.600]   But also, I love that iPad Pro.
[01:27:36.600 --> 01:27:38.080]   I love a big tablet.
[01:27:38.080 --> 01:27:39.080]   I love a giant tablet.
[01:27:39.080 --> 01:27:41.120]   And I believe in the future of using tablets
[01:27:41.120 --> 01:27:43.360]   as replacements for desktops and laptops and stuff
[01:27:43.360 --> 01:27:44.160]   like that.
[01:27:44.160 --> 01:27:46.080]   This is really, really exciting.
[01:27:46.080 --> 01:27:49.440]   Alex Lindsey, chief architect at Pixel Core.
[01:27:49.440 --> 01:27:52.080]   Thank you so much for this grueling--
[01:27:52.080 --> 01:27:53.080]   Oh, it's fun.
[01:27:53.080 --> 01:27:54.880]   --set of appearances done here today.
[01:27:54.880 --> 01:27:56.600]   This is a-- we've been here-- we've been sitting in that chair
[01:27:56.600 --> 01:27:57.560]   for hours.
[01:27:57.560 --> 01:27:58.680]   You guys tired?
[01:27:58.680 --> 01:27:59.200]   No.
[01:27:59.200 --> 01:27:59.720]   No.
[01:27:59.720 --> 01:28:00.200]   No.
[01:28:00.200 --> 01:28:01.720]   No.
[01:28:01.720 --> 01:28:02.560]   I don't have time to be tired.
[01:28:02.560 --> 01:28:03.200]   Coffee.
[01:28:03.200 --> 01:28:04.360]   But thank you so much.
[01:28:04.360 --> 01:28:07.400]   And Alison Sheridan, thank you so much for jumping on
[01:28:07.400 --> 01:28:08.120]   at the last minute.
[01:28:08.120 --> 01:28:11.320]   So great to have you and your perspective on things.
[01:28:11.320 --> 01:28:15.120]   Where can people listen to nozilla cast?
[01:28:15.120 --> 01:28:17.440]   So it's a technology geek podcast
[01:28:17.440 --> 01:28:19.480]   with an ever so slight Macintosh bias.
[01:28:19.480 --> 01:28:22.000]   In other words, giant Macintosh bias.
[01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:23.960]   It's at podfeet.com.
[01:28:23.960 --> 01:28:25.400]   And it's actually nozilla cast.
[01:28:25.400 --> 01:28:26.880]   But I went ahead and bought nozilla cast
[01:28:26.880 --> 01:28:28.880]   because that's what Leo always calls it anyway,
[01:28:28.880 --> 01:28:32.000]   so that you can still find it no matter how you spell it.
[01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:33.360]   Wow.
[01:28:33.360 --> 01:28:34.440]   That is awesome.
[01:28:34.440 --> 01:28:36.200]   My big question is, do I need something
[01:28:36.200 --> 01:28:42.040]   between my 12-inch MacBook and my 9.7-inch MacBook Air 1?
[01:28:42.040 --> 01:28:44.120]   I think I need something right in between those two, right?
[01:28:44.120 --> 01:28:44.920]   Of course you do.
[01:28:44.920 --> 01:28:45.640]   Of course you do.
[01:28:45.640 --> 01:28:47.200]   What are you even asking for?
[01:28:47.200 --> 01:28:48.720]   Of course you do.
[01:28:48.720 --> 01:28:50.040]   Get my checkbook right now.
[01:28:50.040 --> 01:28:50.840]   Yes.
[01:28:50.840 --> 01:28:51.600]   Thanks for having me, Mike.
[01:28:51.600 --> 01:28:52.520]   This is really fun.
[01:28:52.520 --> 01:28:54.000]   Thank you so much as well.
[01:28:54.000 --> 01:28:57.840]   And I'd also like to thank Adam Christensen, who was on early.
[01:28:57.840 --> 01:29:00.440]   And also we dragooned into service, right,
[01:29:00.440 --> 01:29:02.880]   at the event there at the Bill Graham Civic Auditorium.

[01:29:07.880 --> 01:29:09.200]   And the one and only Christina Warren,
[01:29:09.200 --> 01:29:11.640]   Mashable Senior Tech Correspondent.
[01:29:11.640 --> 01:29:14.520]   And it was so great to have them on.
[01:29:14.520 --> 01:29:18.800]   And I want to thank all of you for watching and listening
[01:29:18.800 --> 01:29:19.560]   today.
[01:29:19.560 --> 01:29:21.440]   And we normally do Macbreak weekly

[01:29:27.800 --> 01:29:30.760]   We moved to this week, of course, because of the event.

[01:29:37.800 --> 01:29:38.360]   You name it.
[01:29:38.360 --> 01:29:39.920]   There are so many ways to subscribe.
[01:29:39.920 --> 01:29:43.960]   You can also go to twit.tv/mbw to subscribe,

[01:29:49.760 --> 01:29:52.880]   Of course, Leo will be back in this chair next week on Tuesday.
[01:29:52.880 --> 01:29:54.920]   So get back to work.
[01:29:54.920 --> 01:29:56.360]   Great time is over.
[01:29:56.360 --> 01:29:59.760]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:29:59.760 --> 01:30:03.120]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:30:03.120 --> 01:30:05.700]   (upbeat music)
[01:30:05.700 --> 01:30:08.280]   (upbeat music)
