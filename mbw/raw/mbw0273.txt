[00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:24.400]   Where is he, really?
[00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:25.720]   I think he's--
[00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:27.560]   He's freedom fighting up and down the Congo.
[00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:31.200]   He's in Zakati Park.
[00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.040]   But right now joining us from Boston, Massachusetts,
[00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:37.000]   and the environs there, it's Mr. Andy Ennaco.
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.480]   Good to see you again.
[00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:39.520]   Good to see you guys.
[00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:41.920]   I'm glad to see that the police could not shake you out
[00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:43.560]   of the Occupy Quit Studios movement.
[00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:44.560]   Fight the power.
[00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:46.320]   Oh, WTS.
[00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.640]   You know, I'm reading on your recommendation,
[00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:51.040]   Roger Ebert's fabulous life itself book.
[00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:53.200]   And I'm on-- the reason I'm late--
[00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:55.440]   Steak and Shake chapter.
[00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:56.840]   In which-- you remember that chapter?
[00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:58.720]   He just goes on for a whole chapter
[00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:02.360]   about the magnificence that is Steak and Shake.
[00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:04.800]   Yeah, he took me out of Steak and Shake once.
[00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:07.280]   And I could tell that I was--
[00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:12.280]   it was like the cardinal taking on a tour
[00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:13.520]   through a cathedral.
[00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:15.760]   It's like-- it was a great restaurant.
[00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:17.600]   It was a great lunch, but you could tell that--
[00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:20.240]   And this booth right here.
[00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:23.000]   I almost wanted to take off my hat, hold up my hands.
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.880]   That's not disrespect to Steak and Shake.
[00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:26.600]   He's a big fan of the Steak and Shake.
[00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:28.120]   I actually learned about Steak and Shake
[00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:29.440]   from Patrick Norton, who also--
[00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:31.280]   I get apparently everybody who grew up in that area,
[00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:35.160]   Patrick-- it's also from-- well, I think the Illinois area.
[00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:37.840]   But they're fanatical about it.
[00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:39.800]   And I enjoyed it greatly.
[00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:41.160]   But I-- you know.
[00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:43.440]   But then after listening to this chapter,
[00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:45.160]   I'm salivating.
[00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:46.240]   Sounds so good.
[00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:47.040]   Anyway, welcome, Andy.
[00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:51.120]   That other laugh over there is all the way from Liverpool.
[00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:55.560]   He is our token northern Englander, Mr. Don McAllister.
[00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:57.040]   A screen call of the outline.
[00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:58.720]   Thank you for inviting me, yes, again.
[00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:01.480]   You know, what he says is, just as the Brit
[00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:06.120]   loves his bangers and mash, I love my Steak and Shake.
[00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:08.440]   Bangers and mash can't beat it with a bit of gravy.
[00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:09.880]   Nice, lovely.
[00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:11.520]   The only thing-- I like bangers and mash,
[00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:13.600]   but there is also a-- what is it called?
[00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:16.120]   Egg bun or bacon bun?
[00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:17.640]   Bacon bun.
[00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:18.640]   Yeah, well, we do have--
[00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:19.160]   This is custom--
[00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:20.000]   Bacon rolls and stuff.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:20.440]   Bacon roll.
[00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:21.440]   Disgusting.
[00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:22.120]   Bacon roll.
[00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:24.040]   Oh, well, just don't get it on a train.
[00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:26.040]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:26.560]   Right.
[00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:27.800]   That was my mistake.
[00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:29.040]   Bacon bun.
[00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:29.560]   She's right.
[00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:29.920]   No.
[00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:31.120]   No, bacon buddies.
[00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:33.040]   And then finally-- and we're so glad to have her.
[00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:34.200]   I don't think you've ever been on Macbreak.
[00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:34.760]   I haven't.
[00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:37.640]   Sarah Lane, a host of iPad Today and Tech News Today
[00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:38.680]   and the social hour.
[00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:39.440]   That's true.
[00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:40.400]   See, I don't want to work.
[00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:42.960]   You already got-- you know, a daily show, two weekly shows,
[00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:43.560]   one more show.
[00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:44.680]   I just thought it'd be too much for you.
[00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:50.000]   You underestimate my commitment to the Twittotial Arts.
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:51.200]   And she brought her Twitt hanky.
[00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:51.800]   That's not the one.
[00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:52.280]   That's the one.
[00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:53.160]   I was just there.
[00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:53.720]   Yeah, sure.
[00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:54.800]   Don't deny it.
[00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:56.560]   I saw it fall out of your sleeve.
[00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:57.920]   Anyways, welcome to--
[00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:58.760]   It's lovely, Hanky.
[00:03:58.760 --> 00:03:59.120]   Macbreak.
[00:03:59.120 --> 00:03:59.920]   Isn't it funny?
[00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:00.440]   Yeah.
[00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:01.280]   Macbreak weekly.
[00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:02.880]   I think we have pens to go with it.
[00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:03.960]   Keep dry, Pad clean.
[00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:07.720]   So there's two big things happen today, at least.
[00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:08.600]   One is the Kindle Fire.
[00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:11.320]   We'll get to that in a minute, because we have one here.
[00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:14.120]   But the other-- and I want to do this first--
[00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:17.200]   is Music Match launch yesterday.
[00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:19.800]   And I want to talk to you guys, because I am already
[00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:20.840]   having some issues with it.
[00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:25.440]   I turned it on on my desktop, where all my 46 gigabytes of music
[00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:28.880]   are stored, and paid the $25.
[00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:31.480]   And it didn't take very long to scan my library.
[00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:34.760]   And I think as I left for work, it was now kind of starting
[00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:36.400]   to do something matching.
[00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:37.720]   I don't know what it's doing.
[00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:39.320]   But I'm a little concerned, because then I also
[00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:42.760]   turned it on to my iOS devices, on my iPad, and my iPhone.
[00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:44.320]   And I was listening to music on my iPhone
[00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:46.800]   that isn't on my iPhone.
[00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:48.320]   But it's making some mistakes.
[00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:50.960]   For instance, I was listening to what I thought was Frank Sinatra
[00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:54.800]   witchcraft, and I got cake going the distance.
[00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:58.480]   So the deal with iTunes Match, I know, is that--
[00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:00.960]   and this is something that was concerning people--
[00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:04.600]   is metadata freaks, people who really have their metadata
[00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:06.040]   to set a certain way.
[00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:08.320]   It will remember your original metadata.
[00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:11.960]   So even if you go ahead and get that 256 AAC version of a song
[00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:14.160]   that you already have, bring it back down,
[00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:16.920]   redownload it so that you now have a better version of the song
[00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:17.760]   you started out with.
[00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:19.680]   It will not override your metadata.
[00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:20.880]   That's good.
[00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:22.920]   But I don't know where you got this Frank Sinatra stuff.
[00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:24.600]   But if your metadata was screwed up,
[00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:26.000]   iTunes isn't going to fix that for you.
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:27.400]   So that might be where the problem is.
[00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:29.160]   But it's playing cake.
[00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:29.800]   I don't see--
[00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:30.720]   Well, my point is--
[00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:31.880]   That's not good.
[00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:32.360]   Yeah, I don't know.
[00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:33.280]   And also, it's stuck now.
[00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:33.720]   I've heard that.
[00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:34.240]   It's stuck now.
[00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:34.680]   See this?
[00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:35.080]   I can't.
[00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:36.560]   It's not responsive.
[00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:37.640]   So--
[00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:38.480]   You sure you don't have--
[00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:39.800]   So did you turn it on?
[00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:40.760]   No, I actually haven't--
[00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:43.240]   Well, I have a sort of complicated music library
[00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:44.440]   on a different computer than I have used.
[00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:47.120]   I guess what I'm saying to people is maybe we--
[00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:48.640]   Cake has a song called Frank Sinatra.
[00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:50.360]   Oh my god.
[00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:52.720]   My world's colliding.
[00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:54.600]   Unfortunately, that was not the song that it played.
[00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:56.440]   So now I'm really confused.
[00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:58.440]   But I'm just saying that maybe we should wait.
[00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:00.560]   It's only been out of day and wait and see
[00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:04.880]   and hear the howls of pain before we jump into it.
[00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:07.720]   Andy, I presume you jumped into it yesterday.
[00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:10.800]   I jumped into it on the sandbox machine
[00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:13.400]   that I use for things that I really--
[00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:15.520]   Things that I really can't report to go wrong.
[00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:15.920]   So--
[00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:16.920]   A wise man.
[00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:19.960]   I'm leaving for like two and a half days tomorrow.
[00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:22.640]   And if all my music that gets synced to all my mobile devices
[00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:25.360]   gets screwed up, that's going to be a long three days Leo.
[00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:29.400]   So I gave it a small library of about 800, 900 songs.
[00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:30.200]   It worked OK.
[00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:32.320]   It was actually the same library that I've been testing it
[00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:34.400]   with in the various developer previews.
[00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:36.560]   But it's just as you say, the proof
[00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:39.240]   is when millions of people start to use this all
[00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:42.080]   at the same time when all of those little corner cases
[00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:43.360]   are going to get shaken out.
[00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:45.360]   The stuff that I was giving it wasn't the stuff that
[00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:49.760]   has been in my library by and large for 15 years.
[00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:52.640]   Mostly it was stuff that I had already purchased through MP3
[00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:54.400]   or ripped directly from CD.
[00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:58.240]   So it's a consistent story with Apple.
[00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:00.880]   As with iCloud, as with iOS 5, it's
[00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:03.400]   going to take a few weeks for all of the problems
[00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:04.360]   shaken cells out.
[00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:06.480]   So that's why I think that's smart if you have a really big
[00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:08.480]   library to just hold off for a little while.
[00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:10.000]   iTunes Match wasn't even out.
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:10.960]   I mean, it was what?
[00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:13.480]   Three hours before Apple said we're
[00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:16.520]   throttling back subscriptions because the demand is so high
[00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:17.520]   yesterday.
[00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:19.200]   Whenever you see stuff like that, I just think,
[00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:20.440]   I'll wait a week.
[00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:23.040]   Now, the only reason I say how bad it is
[00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:24.600]   is because I don't want Don to feel bad because it's not
[00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:25.520]   available yet.
[00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:26.440]   That's right.
[00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:27.200]   That's right.
[00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:29.640]   Unfortunately-- and I know there are some people who've got
[00:07:29.640 --> 00:07:31.680]   US accounts unofficially.
[00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:34.280]   But normally, when you have a US account and you're not in the US,
[00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:37.440]   it's normally iTunes cards and things that you populate it with.
[00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:39.160]   But unfortunately, you can't actually sign up
[00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:42.120]   for an iTunes Match account or pay for iTunes Match
[00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:43.640]   without a valid US credit card.
[00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:46.000]   So there won't be very many people outside of the US
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:46.920]   having access to it.
[00:07:46.920 --> 00:07:49.080]   But I did think, though, that when it kicks off
[00:07:49.080 --> 00:07:52.440]   and it matches your library, it doesn't actually do anything
[00:07:52.440 --> 00:07:54.560]   to the music on your hard disk does it.
[00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:55.840]   And do I think to the music locally?
[00:07:55.840 --> 00:07:57.280]   Unless you download it.
[00:07:57.280 --> 00:07:59.640]   Yeah, but so if you're playing something off the cloud,
[00:07:59.640 --> 00:08:00.720]   there might be a mismatch.
[00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:02.920]   But unless you delete it from your local hard disk
[00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:04.720]   and then re-download it, I think you probably--
[00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:05.520]   That's my concern.
[00:08:05.520 --> 00:08:08.680]   That would be my concern is what if--
[00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:09.520]   yeah, I'm streaming it.
[00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:11.080]   OK, not a horrible thing.
[00:08:11.080 --> 00:08:13.520]   But what if I say then download everything you match
[00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:15.640]   and it replaces my Frank Sinatra witchcraft?
[00:08:15.640 --> 00:08:17.880]   Yeah, that's something you need to be careful of, I think.
[00:08:17.880 --> 00:08:21.200]   Yeah, iCloud's music matches mostly a feature for iOS devices.
[00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:24.720]   It saves you the trouble of having to put so many multi-gigabytes
[00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:26.440]   of your music into the cloud stick,
[00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:29.280]   then pull it back down again through iOS.
[00:08:29.280 --> 00:08:30.400]   Well, and then I also--
[00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:30.760]   Oh, I did hear it.
[00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:30.960]   Go ahead.
[00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:34.040]   I did hear that you can actually-- if you've got low quality music
[00:08:34.040 --> 00:08:36.760]   on your local drive and it matches it and it matches it correctly,
[00:08:36.760 --> 00:08:39.320]   you can actually download the higher quality.
[00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:41.320]   So you can delete the low bit rate version and then the--
[00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:44.880]   Yes, which is great for anybody except people who are lossless fans.
[00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:45.080]   Right.
[00:08:45.080 --> 00:08:45.680]   Because it won't give you--
[00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:46.280]   Then you're screwed.
[00:08:46.280 --> 00:08:47.680]   Then you're actually downgrade.
[00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:50.080]   So I guess the-- I guess we all agree.
[00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:52.040]   Our advice would be, move slowly.
[00:08:52.040 --> 00:08:55.920]   And if you have spent a lot of time on your music library,
[00:08:55.920 --> 00:09:00.040]   you might want to set it aside and then maybe make a copy or something.
[00:09:00.040 --> 00:09:01.640]   Because now here's the other thing.
[00:09:01.640 --> 00:09:04.920]   I am streaming it, so it's recognized all my songs.
[00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:07.360]   And it's got-- I mean, here's some oddball stuff I've got on here.
[00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:09.680]   But now it's frozen up because it just won't play.
[00:09:09.680 --> 00:09:10.920]   It's not really streaming, right?
[00:09:10.920 --> 00:09:11.560]   Isn't it?
[00:09:11.560 --> 00:09:13.080]   It's temporary downloads.
[00:09:13.080 --> 00:09:14.080]   I'm not sure what it is.
[00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:16.280]   It says it won't do it on 3G.
[00:09:16.280 --> 00:09:20.200]   And now it's just unresponsive while it tries to get this song played.
[00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:21.720]   You see, it sees 8,000 on it.
[00:09:21.720 --> 00:09:22.480]   I mean, this is nice.
[00:09:22.480 --> 00:09:25.920]   I didn't have to load anything on my iPod or my iPhone.
[00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:28.800]   It sees 8,933 songs.
[00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:30.680]   But it just doesn't--
[00:09:30.680 --> 00:09:35.360]   Phil-- Philsoffly works the same way as the purchased music
[00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:39.640]   you've already purchased tab in the iTunes Store and the iOS app works.
[00:09:39.640 --> 00:09:42.560]   So it's not so much that it's streaming so much as it's saying,
[00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:44.160]   oh, I guess he wants that on this device now.
[00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:44.800]   I'll download it.
[00:09:44.800 --> 00:09:45.160]   And it'll be--
[00:09:45.160 --> 00:09:46.920]   So if I listen to it-- oh, OK.
[00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:48.400]   Now that's an important point.
[00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:51.440]   So if I now listen to it, it will--
[00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:53.160]   because I can listen to anything in my library,
[00:09:53.160 --> 00:09:56.760]   whether it's on my thing or not, that's a signal to download it in full
[00:09:56.760 --> 00:09:57.800]   and keep it.
[00:09:57.800 --> 00:09:58.640]   Is that right?
[00:09:58.640 --> 00:10:01.400]   I haven't gone through the full point-by-point,
[00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:08.400]   full point test.
[00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:09.400]   I'm sorry.
[00:10:09.400 --> 00:10:12.200]   Apple site said specifically as of a couple of weeks ago
[00:10:12.200 --> 00:10:13.440]   that this is not a streaming service.
[00:10:13.440 --> 00:10:14.920]   It's a download service.
[00:10:14.920 --> 00:10:19.440]   But I haven't-- that said, my hands were full with updating
[00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:21.760]   like my Kindle Fire review over the weekend.
[00:10:21.760 --> 00:10:24.080]   So essentially, it was, oh, damn, today's the day
[00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:24.720]   that's going to drop.
[00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:26.440]   Thank you, Apple.
[00:10:26.440 --> 00:10:29.360]   Do it enough so I can see how it works in case someone asks me
[00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:31.360]   about it over the course of the next week.
[00:10:31.360 --> 00:10:35.640]   But I've happened-- I mean, reserving full investigation
[00:10:35.640 --> 00:10:36.640]   for another week or so.
[00:10:36.640 --> 00:10:38.920]   I think, as I understand it, there's some sort of a temp
[00:10:38.920 --> 00:10:41.120]   cache where you actually do download the song
[00:10:41.120 --> 00:10:45.440]   because it gets them around having to figure out streaming
[00:10:45.440 --> 00:10:48.400]   situations with the big--
[00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:50.360]   It appears to stream.
[00:10:50.360 --> 00:10:50.880]   Right.
[00:10:50.880 --> 00:10:54.120]   Well, it has a small cache that just things just get out.
[00:10:54.120 --> 00:10:56.680]   And I think for a normal user, the distinction
[00:10:56.680 --> 00:11:01.680]   between streaming and downloaded and play while you download
[00:11:01.680 --> 00:11:03.800]   and cache and play while you download
[00:11:03.800 --> 00:11:06.080]   is completely elusive.
[00:11:06.080 --> 00:11:06.600]   Right.
[00:11:06.600 --> 00:11:07.720]   I mean, it's streaming.
[00:11:07.720 --> 00:11:08.680]   I press play.
[00:11:08.680 --> 00:11:10.280]   It plays.
[00:11:10.280 --> 00:11:12.920]   I don't really care what the difference is
[00:11:12.920 --> 00:11:17.560]   as long as my iPhone, iPad, iOS device
[00:11:17.560 --> 00:11:19.720]   doesn't slow down because it's getting bogged down--
[00:11:19.720 --> 00:11:21.640]   Well, and that's the problem I'm on right now.
[00:11:21.640 --> 00:11:24.640]   Even on our very fast Wi-Fi, I'm in the music player
[00:11:24.640 --> 00:11:27.920]   and I'm stuck on this cut, which is an iTunes cut.
[00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:29.640]   Merlin Mann bought this for me.
[00:11:29.640 --> 00:11:33.680]   Coil and Sharp, burn your bag from the fantastic album,
[00:11:33.680 --> 00:11:35.520]   these two men are imposters.
[00:11:35.520 --> 00:11:37.280]   And it's just stuck there.
[00:11:37.280 --> 00:11:39.160]   And it's been stuck there since for half an hour.
[00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:41.160]   No, have you--
[00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:43.120]   Have I what?
[00:11:43.120 --> 00:11:43.840]   Have I what?
[00:11:43.840 --> 00:11:45.280]   What if you hard restart?
[00:11:45.280 --> 00:11:46.040]   All right.
[00:11:46.040 --> 00:11:47.880]   And by the way-- I hate to suggest that,
[00:11:47.880 --> 00:11:48.800]   but sometimes that helps.
[00:11:48.800 --> 00:11:52.480]   And that's another issue because with iOS 501,
[00:11:52.480 --> 00:11:55.280]   I have had to do a lot of hard restarting lately.
[00:11:55.280 --> 00:11:55.720]   Have you?
[00:11:55.720 --> 00:11:56.720]   Yeah.
[00:11:56.720 --> 00:11:58.400]   Have you two, Andy?
[00:11:58.400 --> 00:12:01.120]   Now, look, I force closed and I'm in the same spot.
[00:12:01.120 --> 00:12:01.960]   Oh, yeah.
[00:12:01.960 --> 00:12:02.460]   See you.
[00:12:02.460 --> 00:12:03.440]   Oh, no, here we go.
[00:12:03.440 --> 00:12:04.440]   Oh, it's playing.
[00:12:04.440 --> 00:12:04.960]   We're at the playing.
[00:12:04.960 --> 00:12:05.440]   There you go.
[00:12:05.440 --> 00:12:05.600]   Yeah.
[00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:06.600]   It's playing.
[00:12:06.600 --> 00:12:07.100]   Woo hoo.
[00:12:07.100 --> 00:12:10.440]   I mean, it's not working like Kindle MP3's
[00:12:10.440 --> 00:12:12.760]   to our streaming works in which you press a button.
[00:12:12.760 --> 00:12:14.600]   There's like a slight delay while it fills up the buffer
[00:12:14.600 --> 00:12:15.760]   and then starts playing immediately.
[00:12:15.760 --> 00:12:17.320]   And it just playing works.
[00:12:17.320 --> 00:12:19.800]   But now, so to make the point, none of these songs
[00:12:19.800 --> 00:12:23.200]   are on my iPhone and they are playing,
[00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:25.400]   maybe they're downloading too.
[00:12:25.400 --> 00:12:27.240]   But what's the distinction from the endpoint of you,
[00:12:27.240 --> 00:12:28.760]   the end user, between this and streaming?
[00:12:28.760 --> 00:12:30.520]   It's playing as soon as I press play.
[00:12:30.520 --> 00:12:31.600]   And it's not on my stuff.
[00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:33.560]   And it's also-- I mean, you were playing what?
[00:12:33.560 --> 00:12:34.920]   Journey open arms a second ago.
[00:12:34.920 --> 00:12:37.600]   You're not going to find that in your playlist on your iPhone.
[00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:39.040]   Ah, that's a good question.
[00:12:39.040 --> 00:12:39.480]   Will I?
[00:12:39.480 --> 00:12:43.280]   No, because that's not what people are looking for when
[00:12:43.280 --> 00:12:45.880]   they have their music backed up in the cloud.
[00:12:45.880 --> 00:12:49.200]   So now I'm stuck playing white Christmas
[00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:51.280]   by the swingle singers and I do apologize.
[00:12:51.280 --> 00:12:54.240]   So this is what happens is on my list here,
[00:12:54.240 --> 00:12:56.800]   stuff that's not on my phone.
[00:12:56.800 --> 00:12:59.400]   It's got a little download cloud, just as it does in iTunes.
[00:12:59.400 --> 00:13:02.480]   But you could download to your phone through the cloud.
[00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:03.160]   It's just not--
[00:13:03.160 --> 00:13:04.000]   By pressing that button.
[00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:06.920]   Yeah, but that's just not the default situation.
[00:13:06.920 --> 00:13:08.120]   What was the Journey song, do you remember?
[00:13:08.120 --> 00:13:08.680]   Open Arms.
[00:13:08.680 --> 00:13:09.280]   Open Arms.
[00:13:09.280 --> 00:13:10.120]   What a great tune.
[00:13:10.120 --> 00:13:10.960]   Let's see.
[00:13:10.960 --> 00:13:12.880]   Let's go right now to open arms.
[00:13:12.880 --> 00:13:15.280]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:13:15.280 --> 00:13:18.520]   Now, now, where this is not streaming,
[00:13:18.520 --> 00:13:19.880]   this is bad singing on it.
[00:13:19.880 --> 00:13:21.280]   Open On.
[00:13:21.280 --> 00:13:24.080]   Is there no search feature?
[00:13:24.080 --> 00:13:25.080]   Is there no--
[00:13:25.080 --> 00:13:26.640]   Is there no search feature?
[00:13:26.640 --> 00:13:27.640]   There's no search.
[00:13:27.640 --> 00:13:29.400]   Are there no poor houses?
[00:13:29.400 --> 00:13:30.120]   I don't know.
[00:13:30.120 --> 00:13:31.640]   Open Arms.
[00:13:31.640 --> 00:13:33.880]   Oh, now see, it shows that it's there.
[00:13:33.880 --> 00:13:35.560]   Yeah.
[00:13:35.560 --> 00:13:36.880]   Oh, interesting.
[00:13:36.880 --> 00:13:38.400]   Yeah, see, it's not--
[00:13:38.400 --> 00:13:41.000]   And I can guarantee you that was not on my iPhone.
[00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:41.560]   Yeah.
[00:13:41.560 --> 00:13:43.000]   Again, Apple said it's--
[00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:44.320]   You're right, the Leo.
[00:13:44.320 --> 00:13:46.640]   It's a subtle distinction.
[00:13:46.640 --> 00:13:48.280]   Apple has said it's not a streaming service.
[00:13:48.280 --> 00:13:52.120]   But if you select something, press Play, it starts playing.
[00:13:52.120 --> 00:13:53.800]   I think maybe that's just a legal thing,
[00:13:53.800 --> 00:13:56.040]   so that I can say, no, we're not licensing this for streaming.
[00:13:56.040 --> 00:13:58.520]   We're licensing it just for sharing.
[00:13:58.520 --> 00:14:00.640]   There's letting you play it while you download it.
[00:14:00.640 --> 00:14:01.080]   Yeah.
[00:14:01.080 --> 00:14:03.160]   It's not streaming for the benefit purposes
[00:14:03.160 --> 00:14:04.640]   of the music industry.
[00:14:04.640 --> 00:14:06.280]   For everyone else, it's streaming.
[00:14:06.280 --> 00:14:08.080]   But as we all know, the music industry,
[00:14:08.080 --> 00:14:13.000]   stupid, they'll be fooled by this little ruse.
[00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:17.680]   All right, well, so I guess, wait and see?
[00:14:17.680 --> 00:14:19.040]   What is our advice with music, man?
[00:14:19.040 --> 00:14:21.080]   Well, OK, so what about the people?
[00:14:21.080 --> 00:14:23.320]   I don't know how many songs you have in your library.
[00:14:23.320 --> 00:14:24.480]   Almost 10,000 songs.
[00:14:24.480 --> 00:14:27.160]   OK, so I have fewer than 25,000 songs all-star.
[00:14:27.160 --> 00:14:28.360]   That's the limit.
[00:14:28.360 --> 00:14:29.640]   Right.
[00:14:29.640 --> 00:14:31.960]   There are definitely feathers ruffled by people
[00:14:31.960 --> 00:14:34.560]   who have very large libraries who say this is not helpful.
[00:14:34.560 --> 00:14:35.480]   Oh, please.
[00:14:35.480 --> 00:14:37.760]   If you have 25,000 plus songs--
[00:14:37.760 --> 00:14:38.560]   In one library.
[00:14:38.560 --> 00:14:39.160]   --in one library.
[00:14:39.160 --> 00:14:40.760]   Oh, please.
[00:14:40.760 --> 00:14:42.160]   Are you investigating somebody?
[00:14:42.160 --> 00:14:42.960]   Or is that really interesting?
[00:14:42.960 --> 00:14:44.120]   No, just crying me a river.
[00:14:44.120 --> 00:14:45.360]   I'm saying, oh, please.
[00:14:45.360 --> 00:14:45.920]   Come on.
[00:14:45.920 --> 00:14:47.160]   Really?
[00:14:47.160 --> 00:14:50.040]   Now you're pissed off because for $25 a year,
[00:14:50.040 --> 00:14:52.880]   it won't replace all 25,000 songs in your library?
[00:14:52.880 --> 00:14:55.440]   Well, no, I'm not pissed off because it doesn't apply to me.
[00:14:55.440 --> 00:14:56.240]   But somebody is?
[00:14:56.240 --> 00:14:57.000]   I haven't seen others who are.
[00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:57.360]   Yes.
[00:14:57.360 --> 00:14:57.960]   Somebody is.
[00:14:57.960 --> 00:14:58.800]   Well, I know.
[00:14:58.800 --> 00:15:01.000]   I mean, by the way, Google has exactly the same limit, right?
[00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.160]   25,000 songs.
[00:15:03.160 --> 00:15:05.200]   So it seems like a lot of music.
[00:15:05.200 --> 00:15:07.480]   Now, the songs that you purchase through iTunes
[00:15:07.480 --> 00:15:09.840]   will not count against that number.
[00:15:09.840 --> 00:15:12.320]   So many people are complaining actually
[00:15:12.320 --> 00:15:14.560]   may not be as upset as they think they are.
[00:15:14.560 --> 00:15:18.400]   But if you had maybe a huge CD collection, for example,
[00:15:18.400 --> 00:15:21.160]   and it wasn't stuff, there's a gray area.
[00:15:21.160 --> 00:15:22.680]   It's kind of on a case-by-case basis.
[00:15:22.680 --> 00:15:25.640]   We sort of makes this whole thing feel non-appily
[00:15:25.640 --> 00:15:27.080]   because it's confusing.
[00:15:27.080 --> 00:15:28.800]   It is a little complicated.
[00:15:28.800 --> 00:15:29.280]   Yeah.
[00:15:29.280 --> 00:15:30.800]   There have been a lot of missteps
[00:15:30.800 --> 00:15:31.840]   like that over the past few months
[00:15:31.840 --> 00:15:35.240]   between things involving developer sandboxing, things
[00:15:35.240 --> 00:15:37.040]   involving iCloud, this.
[00:15:37.040 --> 00:15:38.880]   There's a lot of lack of elegance that's
[00:15:38.880 --> 00:15:41.280]   happening in Apple products that we're just not used to.
[00:15:41.280 --> 00:15:42.360]   Yeah.
[00:15:42.360 --> 00:15:42.800]   Yeah.
[00:15:42.800 --> 00:15:44.040]   It is interesting, isn't it?
[00:15:44.040 --> 00:15:45.800]   I think some of that, though, is the scale of it, though, isn't it?
[00:15:45.800 --> 00:15:47.800]   I mean, they've done so much in the past three months.
[00:15:47.800 --> 00:15:49.520]   You've got to cut them some slack.
[00:15:49.520 --> 00:15:50.880]   Yeah, true.
[00:15:50.880 --> 00:15:53.280]   But historically, they're the company that says,
[00:15:53.280 --> 00:15:56.880]   we want to do the one subcomponent of this large plan
[00:15:56.880 --> 00:15:58.920]   that we know we can execute flawlessly
[00:15:58.920 --> 00:16:01.240]   so that by the time these phones ship,
[00:16:01.240 --> 00:16:02.720]   people won't have third-party apps,
[00:16:02.720 --> 00:16:05.080]   but they will have stable apps that actually work.
[00:16:05.080 --> 00:16:07.120]   They'll have a platform, at least for the first year,
[00:16:07.120 --> 00:16:10.880]   that is stable and doesn't chew up battery in about 30 minutes.
[00:16:10.880 --> 00:16:15.480]   So I'm not saying it's necessarily the death of Apple approaching,
[00:16:15.480 --> 00:16:18.600]   but it's interesting that we're dealing with all these little nitpicky
[00:16:18.600 --> 00:16:21.040]   problems that we're just not used to facing.
[00:16:21.040 --> 00:16:23.120]   It's rare that you find that kind of a--
[00:16:23.120 --> 00:16:27.240]   it's rare that you find people saying, oh, well, yeah, it's a great feature,
[00:16:27.240 --> 00:16:28.840]   but you don't want to use it for the next couple of weeks
[00:16:28.840 --> 00:16:30.520]   until Apple shakes some of the bugs out.
[00:16:30.520 --> 00:16:33.080]   Maybe this is-- there's a reason for this.
[00:16:33.080 --> 00:16:34.840]   It's these cloud services.
[00:16:34.840 --> 00:16:37.920]   It strikes me that MobileMe was equally confusing.
[00:16:37.920 --> 00:16:42.320]   iCloud is worse and also has kind of similar problems where you say,
[00:16:42.320 --> 00:16:46.600]   well, maybe you want to hold off syncing on MobileMe and things like that.
[00:16:46.600 --> 00:16:50.160]   So maybe it's something about cloud services that just is more complicated,
[00:16:50.160 --> 00:16:53.120]   but it does strike me that this has happened before.
[00:16:53.120 --> 00:16:56.280]   It is rare with Apple, but where it happened before was MobileMe.
[00:16:56.280 --> 00:16:57.480]   I don't know the cloud service here.
[00:16:57.480 --> 00:16:58.240]   Yeah.
[00:16:58.240 --> 00:16:59.800]   Maybe that's just a complicated concept.
[00:16:59.800 --> 00:17:01.160]   I think it is because of syncing.
[00:17:01.160 --> 00:17:03.240]   See, that's the problem is you have copy--
[00:17:03.240 --> 00:17:05.400]   I have local copies, I have cloud copies.
[00:17:05.400 --> 00:17:07.680]   What is the relationship between the two?
[00:17:07.680 --> 00:17:10.920]   Well, cloud copies replace my local copies.
[00:17:10.920 --> 00:17:13.760]   That isn't inherently, I think, confusing situation.
[00:17:13.760 --> 00:17:17.400]   Yeah, and also inherently dangerous because with iCloud,
[00:17:17.400 --> 00:17:20.520]   you have one copy of the truth that's on the server,
[00:17:20.520 --> 00:17:25.480]   and that if a sub-device decides that, no, actually iCloud is screwed up,
[00:17:25.480 --> 00:17:27.680]   I actually have the correct copy of this thing,
[00:17:27.680 --> 00:17:30.680]   then your MacBook gets out-voted, your iOS device gets out-voted.
[00:17:30.680 --> 00:17:31.640]   That's the reason.
[00:17:31.640 --> 00:17:34.240]   I don't know which craft replaced by cake, as much as I love cake.
[00:17:34.240 --> 00:17:36.360]   I actually have these go in the distance.
[00:17:36.360 --> 00:17:39.520]   So I don't want two copies of it, one marked witchcraft by Frank Sinatra,
[00:17:39.520 --> 00:17:40.760]   one marked cake.
[00:17:40.760 --> 00:17:42.160]   We talked about the--
[00:17:42.160 --> 00:17:43.040]   Are you about to turn it on?
[00:17:43.040 --> 00:17:44.360]   I see you went to the iCloud.
[00:17:44.360 --> 00:17:50.320]   Well, no, what I was going to point out was how storage and--
[00:17:50.320 --> 00:17:55.800]   well, see, the problem is that my iPad uses a different Apple ID
[00:17:55.800 --> 00:17:58.560]   than my iPhone and the MacBook.
[00:17:58.560 --> 00:17:59.560]   That's another problem.
[00:17:59.560 --> 00:18:00.560]   That's another problem.
[00:18:00.560 --> 00:18:01.200]   That's confusing.
[00:18:01.200 --> 00:18:03.120]   That's always been an issue with iTunes.
[00:18:03.120 --> 00:18:05.320]   It's maddening.
[00:18:05.320 --> 00:18:09.720]   And-- but yeah, what I was doing was I was getting into the iCloud settings
[00:18:09.720 --> 00:18:12.800]   where you can go into storage and backup and say, yeah, backup everything to the cloud.
[00:18:12.800 --> 00:18:16.200]   And I worry that people will stop locally backing up.
[00:18:16.200 --> 00:18:19.680]   And I really think you need to do both if you want to be safe.
[00:18:19.680 --> 00:18:20.720]   Absolutely.
[00:18:20.720 --> 00:18:26.120]   I do love the idea, though, of having one canonical copy--
[00:18:26.120 --> 00:18:30.240]   if we can get it to work, canonical copy of my library in the cloud
[00:18:30.240 --> 00:18:33.640]   that I could play on all my iOS devices and all my computers.
[00:18:33.640 --> 00:18:38.600]   Is it limited to five total or is it still five computers
[00:18:38.600 --> 00:18:40.520]   and an unlimited number of iOS devices?
[00:18:40.520 --> 00:18:41.480]   Didn't they make it all--
[00:18:41.480 --> 00:18:42.160]   Yeah.
[00:18:42.160 --> 00:18:45.320]   I think it's the five that's just limited to the computers, I think.
[00:18:45.320 --> 00:18:47.760]   I don't think there's any limits on the iOS devices.
[00:18:47.760 --> 00:18:50.560]   I might be wrong, but I haven't come across any limits on iOS.
[00:18:50.560 --> 00:18:52.000]   That's how it used to be, anyway.
[00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:54.560]   And I had some concern that--
[00:18:54.560 --> 00:18:56.480]   I'm seeing this five limit now a lot.
[00:18:56.480 --> 00:18:59.120]   And I'm just wondering if maybe I've activated computers
[00:18:59.120 --> 00:19:00.880]   that I don't know about or something like that.
[00:19:00.880 --> 00:19:03.400]   The problem is, as well, you forget which five computers
[00:19:03.400 --> 00:19:04.840]   you've activated and also--
[00:19:04.840 --> 00:19:05.840]   Exactly.
[00:19:05.840 --> 00:19:07.440]   We do lots of testing and stuff.
[00:19:07.440 --> 00:19:09.160]   The number be gone.
[00:19:09.160 --> 00:19:12.320]   Chat insane 10 iOS devices, five computers.
[00:19:12.320 --> 00:19:13.400]   Five computers, 10-- OK.
[00:19:13.400 --> 00:19:18.040]   So from 99.9% of people, that would be sufficient.
[00:19:18.040 --> 00:19:20.000]   But the people who have more than 25,000 songs
[00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:23.120]   and more than 10 iOS devices are going to hate this.
[00:19:23.120 --> 00:19:24.040]   We're going to hate this.
[00:19:24.040 --> 00:19:25.200]   We're forgetting the point--
[00:19:25.200 --> 00:19:25.760]   The 1%--
[00:19:25.760 --> 00:19:26.760]   The 1%--
[00:19:26.760 --> 00:19:28.400]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:29.400]   Screw you.
[00:19:29.400 --> 00:19:32.400]   So Andy, what do you think?
[00:19:32.400 --> 00:19:33.120]   People should wait.
[00:19:33.120 --> 00:19:35.040]   I mean, I love the idea.
[00:19:35.040 --> 00:19:37.320]   I'm worried about the execution.
[00:19:37.320 --> 00:19:39.480]   I think that should definitely wait.
[00:19:39.480 --> 00:19:41.400]   I think that everybody is going to have some measure
[00:19:41.400 --> 00:19:43.720]   of difficulty just for the nature of the fact
[00:19:43.720 --> 00:19:48.240]   that if you've had this library for 15, 20 years,
[00:19:48.240 --> 00:19:50.360]   most-- a lot of people started ripping CDs
[00:19:50.360 --> 00:19:52.040]   in like what, '95, '96.
[00:19:52.040 --> 00:19:54.040]   There are going to be a bunch of titles
[00:19:54.040 --> 00:19:56.800]   that just-- music match can't make header tails out of.
[00:19:56.800 --> 00:19:58.000]   So that's going to be a problem.
[00:19:58.000 --> 00:19:59.880]   But I think it's mostly a case of waiting
[00:19:59.880 --> 00:20:03.080]   until the server load kind of drops down a little bit.
[00:20:03.080 --> 00:20:04.800]   This is the super flush phenomenon
[00:20:04.800 --> 00:20:07.640]   where music match goes active and everybody
[00:20:07.640 --> 00:20:09.320]   wants to try it out all at once.
[00:20:09.320 --> 00:20:14.040]   So I think that just by the nature of that in two weeks' time,
[00:20:14.040 --> 00:20:16.320]   it's going to be much smoother transition for most people.
[00:20:16.320 --> 00:20:18.520]   Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[00:20:18.520 --> 00:20:19.400]   I'm just curious.
[00:20:19.400 --> 00:20:20.200]   I'm watching the chatroom.
[00:20:20.200 --> 00:20:21.560]   And I haven't seen howls of pain,
[00:20:21.560 --> 00:20:23.720]   but I'm wondering if that's because the chatroom hasn't
[00:20:23.720 --> 00:20:27.840]   done it yet or if they haven't had any problems.
[00:20:27.840 --> 00:20:29.560]   So chatroom--
[00:20:29.560 --> 00:20:31.120]   A couple of folks had chimed in when
[00:20:31.120 --> 00:20:32.560]   we first started the topic that--
[00:20:32.560 --> 00:20:33.320]   That they were having issues?
[00:20:33.320 --> 00:20:34.480]   No, that they weren't.
[00:20:34.480 --> 00:20:35.920]   Yeah.
[00:20:35.920 --> 00:20:39.120]   So it looks like a lot of people just haven't gotten on it yet.
[00:20:39.120 --> 00:20:39.720]   No problems.
[00:20:39.720 --> 00:20:40.560]   No problems here.
[00:20:40.560 --> 00:20:44.920]   I have 6,000 CDs, Google Music, which I have been using as well,
[00:20:44.920 --> 00:20:46.120]   and I like it.
[00:20:46.120 --> 00:20:47.720]   Tucker says, no way I'm activating it
[00:20:47.720 --> 00:20:52.640]   until they roll iTunes plus upgrade out for something I can't.
[00:20:52.640 --> 00:20:54.800]   Bandwidth caps, that's a big issue, of course,
[00:20:54.800 --> 00:20:59.080]   especially in Canada and Australia.
[00:20:59.080 --> 00:21:02.560]   Did it without an issue, says 5,000 to do 124.
[00:21:02.560 --> 00:21:03.560]   The problem is, though, is that--
[00:21:03.560 --> 00:21:03.920]   Why do you call them?
[00:21:03.920 --> 00:21:06.520]   My entire library says 1276.
[00:21:06.520 --> 00:21:07.840]   Tell us about that.
[00:21:07.840 --> 00:21:09.520]   Error 4001 consistently.
[00:21:09.520 --> 00:21:11.200]   That's probably a network error, right?
[00:21:11.200 --> 00:21:15.520]   No problem for me.
[00:21:15.520 --> 00:21:17.120]   Waiting for the Windows ME update.
[00:21:17.120 --> 00:21:19.760]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:21:19.760 --> 00:21:21.040]   It is not in Canada.
[00:21:21.040 --> 00:21:23.200]   It is US only right now, although they--
[00:21:23.200 --> 00:21:25.040]   I think, correct me if I'm wrong, Don,
[00:21:25.040 --> 00:21:27.920]   but didn't they say it would be rolling out internationally
[00:21:27.920 --> 00:21:28.520]   at some point?
[00:21:28.520 --> 00:21:31.560]   Yeah, there's no date, but soon they said, yeah.
[00:21:31.560 --> 00:21:32.720]   The thing that worries me, though,
[00:21:32.720 --> 00:21:34.280]   is how do you know that it's worked?
[00:21:34.280 --> 00:21:35.920]   Because if you've got a huge library--
[00:21:35.920 --> 00:21:37.920]   I mean, I've got about 12,000 songs or something.
[00:21:37.920 --> 00:21:40.360]   But if I did the match, how do you know which ones it's
[00:21:40.360 --> 00:21:42.880]   match correctly, and how do you know which ones it's made
[00:21:42.880 --> 00:21:44.960]   mistakes on, and how long will it be before you actually
[00:21:44.960 --> 00:21:46.240]   realize there are some mistakes?
[00:21:46.240 --> 00:21:46.600]   Right.
[00:21:46.600 --> 00:21:50.040]   You were the first person, Leo, to say that there was a match
[00:21:50.040 --> 00:21:52.480]   mistake between Frank Sinatra and Cake.
[00:21:52.480 --> 00:21:54.600]   I haven't heard that before.
[00:21:54.600 --> 00:21:56.720]   I believe that--
[00:21:56.720 --> 00:21:59.600]   And I'm looking right now that our friend, Dwight Silverman,
[00:21:59.600 --> 00:22:01.760]   for the Houston Chronicle, says,
[00:22:01.760 --> 00:22:05.480]   "Watch out for potential gotchas on his column."
[00:22:05.480 --> 00:22:07.520]   There's one big caveat if you enable it on your device
[00:22:07.520 --> 00:22:09.080]   and haven't fully synced your music with iCloud.
[00:22:09.080 --> 00:22:11.720]   The only music you see is what's on iCloud.
[00:22:11.720 --> 00:22:14.960]   In other words, it deletes the existing music.
[00:22:14.960 --> 00:22:19.800]   He apparently has had some issues.
[00:22:19.800 --> 00:22:21.520]   This is the thing that worried me as well.
[00:22:21.520 --> 00:22:22.640]   Can you see my computer?
[00:22:22.640 --> 00:22:23.720]   I was about to tell you.
[00:22:23.720 --> 00:22:24.720]   I can't see a computer.
[00:22:24.720 --> 00:22:25.800]   So I always have that problem.
[00:22:25.800 --> 00:22:28.400]   I don't know why.
[00:22:28.400 --> 00:22:30.400]   There is a setting, when you turn on iTunes Match
[00:22:30.400 --> 00:22:34.200]   and on iOS device, that's a big red warning button that says,
[00:22:34.200 --> 00:22:39.040]   "Itoons Match will replace the music library on this device,
[00:22:39.040 --> 00:22:41.320]   enable or cancel."
[00:22:41.320 --> 00:22:45.240]   And so that's a little bit of a confusion.
[00:22:45.240 --> 00:22:46.640]   I haven't seen it delete anything.
[00:22:46.640 --> 00:22:48.400]   I was worried about my Audible books, for instance.
[00:22:48.400 --> 00:22:51.480]   I have a lot of Audible books.
[00:22:51.480 --> 00:22:53.200]   But I haven't seen it--
[00:22:53.200 --> 00:22:55.520]   It hasn't deleted anything yet, to my knowledge.
[00:22:55.520 --> 00:22:57.560]   So I don't understand.
[00:22:57.560 --> 00:22:59.320]   Again, this is one of those things where,
[00:22:59.320 --> 00:23:02.480]   well, what's going on?
[00:23:02.480 --> 00:23:05.640]   Well, it sounds to me that if iTunes Match,
[00:23:05.640 --> 00:23:08.840]   wherever your master library is, if everything goes well
[00:23:08.840 --> 00:23:11.280]   with iTunes Match, then replacing everything
[00:23:11.280 --> 00:23:13.680]   on your iOS devices that you want to do.
[00:23:13.680 --> 00:23:16.040]   Right.
[00:23:16.040 --> 00:23:18.840]   But if you've got, what, 21,000 songs
[00:23:18.840 --> 00:23:20.200]   to go through everything and make sure
[00:23:20.200 --> 00:23:21.480]   that you feel comfortable enough?
[00:23:21.480 --> 00:23:25.680]   Actually, there is an issue, because when I'm not online,
[00:23:25.680 --> 00:23:28.000]   I keep some songs on my device.
[00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:29.640]   I have a 64 gigabyte iPhone.
[00:23:29.640 --> 00:23:31.760]   I mean, I have room, and I would like
[00:23:31.760 --> 00:23:34.200]   to keep some songs on my device for those times
[00:23:34.200 --> 00:23:41.360]   that I'm not online, or an airplane or whatever.
[00:23:41.360 --> 00:23:44.520]   And don't you have to explicitly say, "redownload"?
[00:23:44.520 --> 00:23:47.360]   Otherwise, it quote, "cash streams," or whatever.
[00:23:47.360 --> 00:23:50.040]   We need a new word for whatever this thing is doing.
[00:23:50.040 --> 00:23:52.200]   This fake streaming.
[00:23:52.200 --> 00:23:53.160]   So I'm worried that--
[00:23:53.160 --> 00:23:53.760]   So a stream.
[00:23:53.760 --> 00:23:55.080]   Am I going to lose some--
[00:23:55.080 --> 00:23:59.720]   I mean, this is a legitimate concern based on this warning.
[00:23:59.720 --> 00:24:01.560]   To be able to listen to the music offline?
[00:24:01.560 --> 00:24:02.560]   Yeah.
[00:24:02.560 --> 00:24:03.560]   That's a big deal for me as well.
[00:24:03.560 --> 00:24:04.320]   I have a lot of storage.
[00:24:04.320 --> 00:24:08.000]   Well, I mean, that is something that on mobile devices,
[00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:12.080]   even streaming services like RDO Spotify,
[00:24:12.080 --> 00:24:14.480]   those you can sync to mobile devices,
[00:24:14.480 --> 00:24:16.240]   but you have to tell it to.
[00:24:16.240 --> 00:24:18.680]   Otherwise, it's just streaming when you're connected to an internet.
[00:24:18.680 --> 00:24:19.680]   Well, see, that's the other story.
[00:24:19.680 --> 00:24:22.160]   But you have to think about it in advance a little bit.
[00:24:22.160 --> 00:24:22.680]   Right.
[00:24:22.680 --> 00:24:26.280]   I mean, this is to compete with Spotify, right?
[00:24:26.280 --> 00:24:27.280]   Isn't that really what this is all about?
[00:24:27.280 --> 00:24:28.480]   It's a funny conversation that we're
[00:24:28.480 --> 00:24:32.080]   having because some people really
[00:24:32.080 --> 00:24:34.080]   care about having those files.
[00:24:34.080 --> 00:24:35.960]   The files living in particular places,
[00:24:35.960 --> 00:24:37.880]   whether they're one place or multiple places.
[00:24:37.880 --> 00:24:39.440]   And then there are the other folks who say,
[00:24:39.440 --> 00:24:40.920]   "Why don't you just get a streaming service,
[00:24:40.920 --> 00:24:42.240]   and then you have access to all these songs,
[00:24:42.240 --> 00:24:43.400]   and you don't have to worry about it.
[00:24:43.400 --> 00:24:45.120]   You just stream them whenever you want."
[00:24:45.120 --> 00:24:47.560]   But then, of course, that libraries aren't as robust,
[00:24:47.560 --> 00:24:50.400]   and that's just sort of an emerging technology, too.
[00:24:50.400 --> 00:24:52.760]   It's just there are two schools of thought.
[00:24:52.760 --> 00:24:56.000]   I think this is one of the kind of--
[00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:57.840]   again, this is that confusion with--
[00:24:57.840 --> 00:25:00.120]   I don't know what it's happening.
[00:25:00.120 --> 00:25:01.240]   Yeah.
[00:25:01.240 --> 00:25:05.240]   My mental disconnect is just the knowledge of what music
[00:25:05.240 --> 00:25:10.360]   got there because I synced it from a copper connection
[00:25:10.360 --> 00:25:11.360]   to an iTunes library.
[00:25:11.360 --> 00:25:14.440]   What's there because I got to it from Music Match?
[00:25:14.440 --> 00:25:18.240]   It's, again, not that this is a handy prop,
[00:25:18.240 --> 00:25:20.160]   but one of the things I like about the way
[00:25:20.160 --> 00:25:22.120]   that the Kindle Fire did is that there's
[00:25:22.120 --> 00:25:26.640]   an explicit, separate areas where there's a music library,
[00:25:26.640 --> 00:25:28.320]   but it's always very clear by saying,
[00:25:28.320 --> 00:25:29.800]   you're now in a listing of all the stuff
[00:25:29.800 --> 00:25:30.920]   that you've got on the cloud.
[00:25:30.920 --> 00:25:33.360]   Now here you are in a place that shows you all the stuff that
[00:25:33.360 --> 00:25:35.080]   is actually on your device.
[00:25:35.080 --> 00:25:37.880]   And if you move content from one of these areas
[00:25:37.880 --> 00:25:41.440]   to another area, this another area, it's all good.
[00:25:41.440 --> 00:25:42.200]   It's all natural.
[00:25:42.200 --> 00:25:45.000]   You basically essentially done a manual copy.
[00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:47.440]   It's when things happen automatically and magically
[00:25:47.440 --> 00:25:51.560]   that you kind of lose the mental thread of what steps got me--
[00:25:51.560 --> 00:25:55.080]   got this file from point A to point B. So much of it
[00:25:55.080 --> 00:25:56.960]   is just probably going to be just a mental adjustment
[00:25:56.960 --> 00:25:59.560]   that your iPod and your iPhone used to work this way.
[00:25:59.560 --> 00:26:01.280]   Now it works in a new way.
[00:26:01.280 --> 00:26:07.040]   Mac Roomer's points us to a forum post from Nuna Benez
[00:26:07.040 --> 00:26:10.840]   on Matt the Mac Roomer's forum in which he or she--
[00:26:10.840 --> 00:26:13.280]   in great detail describes what happens.
[00:26:13.280 --> 00:26:15.400]   And this is, I think, relevant.
[00:26:15.400 --> 00:26:17.920]   Nothing happens to your local music when you run match.
[00:26:17.920 --> 00:26:20.880]   If you have a lower quality song that was matched,
[00:26:20.880 --> 00:26:24.360]   according to Nuna, you can remove it from your local library
[00:26:24.360 --> 00:26:26.440]   and then replace it with a 2056K version.
[00:26:26.440 --> 00:26:28.640]   But to do that what you do is you'll
[00:26:28.640 --> 00:26:31.360]   manually, physically delete the song.
[00:26:31.360 --> 00:26:34.160]   You'll see the entry and iTunes with a little puffy cloud.
[00:26:34.160 --> 00:26:35.600]   And then you download it.
[00:26:35.600 --> 00:26:36.640]   And now you've replaced it.
[00:26:36.640 --> 00:26:38.240]   So there is a two-step process.
[00:26:38.240 --> 00:26:42.400]   You do have to very explicitly delete and replace.
[00:26:42.400 --> 00:26:43.120]   So that's good.
[00:26:43.120 --> 00:26:45.120]   And it will replace it at the higher bit rate.
[00:26:45.120 --> 00:26:49.240]   If a song is matched, it becomes available to download
[00:26:49.240 --> 00:26:51.400]   in a 256K AAC.
[00:26:51.400 --> 00:26:54.720]   If it's not matched, if you have stuff bootlegs or things
[00:26:54.720 --> 00:26:57.280]   that aren't in the iTunes library, it's copied.
[00:26:57.280 --> 00:27:00.520]   And its current format and bit rate up to 320K.
[00:27:00.520 --> 00:27:02.640]   If you have a lossless file-- and this is the problem--
[00:27:02.640 --> 00:27:04.360]   a lot of people who are into music
[00:27:04.360 --> 00:27:05.680]   are very serious about it.
[00:27:05.680 --> 00:27:07.960]   And they're using FLAC or Apple Lossless.
[00:27:07.960 --> 00:27:09.560]   If you have a lossless file, it's
[00:27:09.560 --> 00:27:14.120]   going to be turned into a 256K AAC before it's uploaded.
[00:27:14.120 --> 00:27:17.040]   So you'll definitely want to be very careful with your lossless
[00:27:17.040 --> 00:27:19.120]   files because you don't want them replaced.
[00:27:19.120 --> 00:27:21.080]   But again, it's not going to be automatically replaced.
[00:27:21.080 --> 00:27:25.960]   You'd have to explicitly delete and download to do that.
[00:27:25.960 --> 00:27:27.800]   You're not going to get lossless in a cloud, though,
[00:27:27.800 --> 00:27:28.520]   either way.
[00:27:28.520 --> 00:27:30.040]   No lossless.
[00:27:30.040 --> 00:27:33.640]   And if it's formats, it doesn't recognize
[00:27:33.640 --> 00:27:37.400]   like some people have PDFs of the CD, the liner notes,
[00:27:37.400 --> 00:27:38.800]   and stuff like that.
[00:27:38.800 --> 00:27:40.080]   It just ignores that.
[00:27:40.080 --> 00:27:43.120]   And I'm presuming-- and this seems to be the case in my collection--
[00:27:43.120 --> 00:27:45.160]   it ignores audiobooks, audible books.
[00:27:45.160 --> 00:27:46.560]   Unless you bought them in the iTunes store,
[00:27:46.560 --> 00:27:47.880]   I don't know what happens there.
[00:27:47.880 --> 00:27:50.960]   But my audible books, it's just left along.
[00:27:50.960 --> 00:27:53.080]   Everything you buy in the iTunes store
[00:27:53.080 --> 00:27:55.280]   is happily updated to the cloud.
[00:27:55.280 --> 00:27:56.520]   That makes sense.
[00:27:56.520 --> 00:27:58.200]   Because they don't even need to do anything.
[00:27:58.200 --> 00:27:59.160]   They just say, check.
[00:27:59.160 --> 00:28:00.400]   There's a checkbox there.
[00:28:00.400 --> 00:28:03.080]   But we were talking on tech news today, yesterday.
[00:28:03.080 --> 00:28:07.120]   When iTunes was still DRM, I went over
[00:28:07.120 --> 00:28:09.560]   to Amazon Store and started downloading everything
[00:28:09.560 --> 00:28:11.400]   from Amazon Music.
[00:28:11.400 --> 00:28:14.000]   So a lot of that stuff will be matched
[00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:15.640]   because iTunes recognizes it.
[00:28:15.640 --> 00:28:18.040]   But I did not buy it within the iTunes store.
[00:28:18.040 --> 00:28:21.000]   So it counts against my 25,000 songs.
[00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:22.680]   I'm still not up that high.
[00:28:22.680 --> 00:28:24.680]   But that is something to think about.
[00:28:24.680 --> 00:28:26.920]   What a surprise this benefits people who buy iTunes.
[00:28:26.920 --> 00:28:27.280]   Sure.
[00:28:27.280 --> 00:28:29.000]   More than it does anybody else.
[00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:32.160]   What a surprise.
[00:28:32.160 --> 00:28:32.520]   All right.
[00:28:32.520 --> 00:28:36.440]   Well, I think that the real issue is really
[00:28:36.440 --> 00:28:38.360]   what comes down to this whole issue, any time you
[00:28:38.360 --> 00:28:41.480]   sink to the cloud of what's the-- as you said, Andy,
[00:28:41.480 --> 00:28:42.480]   what's the master copy?
[00:28:42.480 --> 00:28:43.560]   Where does it live?
[00:28:43.560 --> 00:28:44.440]   Is it my copy?
[00:28:44.440 --> 00:28:45.560]   What happens to my copy?
[00:28:45.560 --> 00:28:47.040]   What happens to my metadata?
[00:28:47.040 --> 00:28:51.200]   And I'm really concerned, as with context, about duplicates.
[00:28:51.200 --> 00:28:53.480]   But in the opposite direction, with context, sometimes
[00:28:53.480 --> 00:28:55.520]   with sinking, you get more than one of the same thing.
[00:28:55.520 --> 00:28:58.600]   I'm worried that I have three songs, a live performance,
[00:28:58.600 --> 00:29:00.480]   a studio performance, and a bootleg performance
[00:29:00.480 --> 00:29:04.240]   of the same song that metadata wise look exactly the same.
[00:29:04.240 --> 00:29:05.800]   And I'm seeing in the chatroom.
[00:29:05.800 --> 00:29:09.200]   In some cases, what will happen is it will only copy one copy.
[00:29:09.200 --> 00:29:10.640]   It won't recognize that these are--
[00:29:10.640 --> 00:29:12.760]   you don't think these are duplicates.
[00:29:12.760 --> 00:29:15.120]   So that's an issue as well.
[00:29:15.120 --> 00:29:17.960]   To be careful, in other words, save your libraries,
[00:29:17.960 --> 00:29:20.680]   back them up, put them somewhere safe before you do this.
[00:29:20.680 --> 00:29:22.840]   Yeah, that's the huge lesson of iCloud.
[00:29:22.840 --> 00:29:26.320]   It's going to be a great service once all the transition
[00:29:26.320 --> 00:29:27.520]   gets itself shook out.
[00:29:27.520 --> 00:29:30.360]   But the need to actually make sure
[00:29:30.360 --> 00:29:33.160]   that you have a safe copy that's offline,
[00:29:33.160 --> 00:29:34.840]   and that iCloud can't see, can't touch,
[00:29:34.840 --> 00:29:36.160]   and can't fix for you.
[00:29:36.160 --> 00:29:37.960]   I don't think it's ever been more important
[00:29:37.960 --> 00:29:40.200]   than it ever has in 2011.
[00:29:40.200 --> 00:29:41.480]   Hey, we're going to take a break.
[00:29:41.480 --> 00:29:43.040]   When we come back, we'll talk about this.
[00:29:43.040 --> 00:29:45.560]   No, it's not the latest molar scheme.
[00:29:45.560 --> 00:29:46.840]   Oh, looks like it.
[00:29:46.840 --> 00:29:49.480]   Inside this nondescript leather cover.
[00:29:49.480 --> 00:29:51.160]   Well, it actually is the latest molar scheme.
[00:29:51.160 --> 00:29:51.720]   The latest molar scheme.
[00:29:51.720 --> 00:29:54.080]   But there's something else.
[00:29:54.080 --> 00:29:55.360]   It's on fire.
[00:29:55.360 --> 00:29:57.040]   We're going to talk about the Kindle Fire.
[00:29:57.040 --> 00:29:58.600]   And this is not mine.
[00:29:58.600 --> 00:29:59.000]   No.
[00:29:59.000 --> 00:29:59.960]   This is Liz Romero's.
[00:29:59.960 --> 00:30:02.280]   Thank you for lending it to me, Liz, because mine, which,
[00:30:02.280 --> 00:30:04.800]   even though I ordered it, I think exactly the same time
[00:30:04.800 --> 00:30:07.200]   as Liz ordered hers, hasn't arrived yet.
[00:30:07.200 --> 00:30:07.720]   But it should.
[00:30:07.720 --> 00:30:09.360]   Today's the day for the fire.
[00:30:09.360 --> 00:30:11.320]   We'll take a look at just a bit before we do that.
[00:30:11.320 --> 00:30:12.960]   Let's talk a little bit about our friends at Citrix.
[00:30:12.960 --> 00:30:16.640]   I was meeting with them in the Los Angeles yesterday.
[00:30:16.640 --> 00:30:19.360]   And they are telling me all sorts of exciting things
[00:30:19.360 --> 00:30:21.840]   that are happening with all of their products,
[00:30:21.840 --> 00:30:25.200]   including the flagship GoToMeeting.
[00:30:25.200 --> 00:30:26.320]   You've tried GoToMeeting, right?
[00:30:26.320 --> 00:30:28.680]   It's online meetings software.
[00:30:28.680 --> 00:30:30.080]   It shares the screen.
[00:30:30.080 --> 00:30:31.760]   Makes it really easy to set up a meeting.
[00:30:31.760 --> 00:30:33.920]   It's cross-platform, Mac and PC.
[00:30:33.920 --> 00:30:35.880]   So this is great for us Mac folks.
[00:30:35.880 --> 00:30:38.160]   We no longer have to feel like second-class citizens
[00:30:38.160 --> 00:30:39.280]   when there's an online meeting.
[00:30:39.280 --> 00:30:40.520]   No, we're right in there.
[00:30:40.520 --> 00:30:41.600]   And here's the beauty part.
[00:30:41.600 --> 00:30:44.440]   They've just added HD video conferencing to this.
[00:30:44.440 --> 00:30:46.240]   In fact, we might have a little bit of an advantage
[00:30:46.240 --> 00:30:49.000]   because we've got these great HD cameras on our Mac books.
[00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:51.080]   And it works beautifully with these.
[00:30:51.080 --> 00:30:54.440]   If you've never used GoToMeeting, now's a great time
[00:30:54.440 --> 00:30:55.960]   to try it free for 30 days.
[00:30:55.960 --> 00:30:58.360]   Not only will you get the online meeting capabilities,
[00:30:58.360 --> 00:31:00.520]   you'll get the HD video capabilities.
[00:31:00.520 --> 00:31:05.320]   Up to six screens at the same time, such a difference.
[00:31:05.320 --> 00:31:06.720]   When you're in a meeting with somebody
[00:31:06.720 --> 00:31:09.440]   and you see their face, you can read their body language.
[00:31:09.440 --> 00:31:11.360]   If you're making a sales presentation,
[00:31:11.360 --> 00:31:13.160]   you've got your keynote presentation going
[00:31:13.160 --> 00:31:14.560]   and you're looking at the client
[00:31:14.560 --> 00:31:16.800]   and they suddenly fold their arms, that means something.
[00:31:16.800 --> 00:31:19.640]   That's valuable information that you wouldn't necessarily
[00:31:19.640 --> 00:31:22.880]   get on a phone call or other online meeting services.
[00:31:22.880 --> 00:31:23.640]   This is the best.
[00:31:23.640 --> 00:31:25.240]   Go toMeeting.com.
[00:31:25.240 --> 00:31:27.840]   Visit the website, GoToMeeting.com.
[00:31:27.840 --> 00:31:31.040]   And click the Try It Free button, that orange button there.
[00:31:31.040 --> 00:31:32.520]   And enter the offer code MacBreak.
[00:31:32.520 --> 00:31:33.800]   You can use it free for 30 days.
[00:31:33.800 --> 00:31:36.040]   But I've got to tell you, it's very affordable.
[00:31:36.040 --> 00:31:39.080]   $49 a month, including the HD faces.
[00:31:39.080 --> 00:31:41.760]   One of the great value ad things that Citrix does
[00:31:41.760 --> 00:31:45.080]   is they don't raise the price, they just add features.
[00:31:45.080 --> 00:31:47.760]   And this is huge.
[00:31:47.760 --> 00:31:52.280]   I mean, I've seen people spend 10, 20, 30, $100,000
[00:31:52.280 --> 00:31:55.720]   on video conferencing software and hardware
[00:31:55.720 --> 00:32:00.360]   in the conference room, and only the CEO and his cohorts.
[00:32:00.360 --> 00:32:01.800]   Her cohorts can use it.
[00:32:01.800 --> 00:32:03.320]   And they don't use it very much.
[00:32:03.320 --> 00:32:04.960]   Now this brings it to everybody's desktop.
[00:32:04.960 --> 00:32:07.440]   Everybody with a webcam and internet can do it.
[00:32:07.440 --> 00:32:10.000]   Go toMeeting.com, click the Try It Free button.
[00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:13.560]   And use our offer code MacBreak to give it a try for 30 days.
[00:32:13.560 --> 00:32:15.720]   Free, free, free, free.
[00:32:15.720 --> 00:32:18.440]   And we thank Citrix for their support of MacBreak Weekly.
[00:32:18.440 --> 00:32:19.720]   This is my case, though.
[00:32:19.720 --> 00:32:20.440]   I like this case.
[00:32:20.440 --> 00:32:23.560]   This is the Marwyr Moloskinay.
[00:32:23.560 --> 00:32:24.560]   Moloskin.
[00:32:24.560 --> 00:32:25.560]   Moloskin.
[00:32:25.560 --> 00:32:26.560]   Moloskin.
[00:32:26.560 --> 00:32:27.560]   Moloskin.
[00:32:27.560 --> 00:32:28.560]   No one knows.
[00:32:28.560 --> 00:32:29.560]   We're all right.
[00:32:29.560 --> 00:32:30.560]   We're all wrong.
[00:32:30.560 --> 00:32:31.560]   We're all wrong.
[00:32:31.560 --> 00:32:34.320]   The Marwyr as usual does great cases.
[00:32:34.320 --> 00:32:36.800]   I've used a lot of Marwyr cases on my iOS devices.
[00:32:36.800 --> 00:32:41.080]   So I'm going to pop it out, though, so you can see what the fire--
[00:32:41.080 --> 00:32:42.440]   Kindle Fire looks like.
[00:32:42.440 --> 00:32:43.440]   $199.
[00:32:43.440 --> 00:32:46.280]   And the reason we're talking about it on a show like this,
[00:32:46.280 --> 00:32:48.640]   on a Mac show, is, well, if anybody's
[00:32:48.640 --> 00:32:51.080]   going to compete against--
[00:32:51.080 --> 00:32:52.520]   Oops, cancel.
[00:32:52.520 --> 00:32:53.160]   You're right, Andy.
[00:32:53.160 --> 00:32:55.080]   That was really easy to accidentally press that on.
[00:32:55.080 --> 00:32:56.080]   Yeah.
[00:32:56.080 --> 00:32:57.280]   It's on the bottom right there.
[00:32:57.280 --> 00:32:59.200]   And the way you're just holding it, you can accidentally.
[00:32:59.200 --> 00:33:01.680]   Especially when you're sitting and you're just like--
[00:33:01.680 --> 00:33:04.280]   you adjust a book in your hands so many times
[00:33:04.280 --> 00:33:06.040]   over the course of 10 minutes when you're reading.
[00:33:06.040 --> 00:33:09.080]   And yeah, I keep coming up with it, holding it down long enough
[00:33:09.080 --> 00:33:10.560]   to get at that--
[00:33:10.560 --> 00:33:11.920]   would you like to shut down your Kindle, though?
[00:33:11.920 --> 00:33:12.920]   No, I think I'd--
[00:33:12.920 --> 00:33:14.800]   You'd actually like to keep writing if that's OK.
[00:33:14.800 --> 00:33:16.440]   I'm using it.
[00:33:16.440 --> 00:33:17.600]   It feels fairly snap.
[00:33:17.600 --> 00:33:19.600]   Now, this is my first time seeing it.
[00:33:19.600 --> 00:33:23.160]   They've got a new Netflix interface for it.
[00:33:23.160 --> 00:33:26.520]   The browser feels very snappy, this new silk browser.
[00:33:26.520 --> 00:33:27.520]   What do you think, Andy?
[00:33:27.520 --> 00:33:29.520]   You've got yours in your hot little hands.
[00:33:29.520 --> 00:33:31.800]   Yeah, I've had mine for about a week.
[00:33:31.800 --> 00:33:34.960]   And I like it a lot.
[00:33:34.960 --> 00:33:36.880]   I don't agree with the rinse of negative reviews
[00:33:36.880 --> 00:33:39.000]   that try to say, oh, well, it doesn't-- unlike the iPad,
[00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:39.640]   it doesn't do this.
[00:33:39.640 --> 00:33:41.160]   And it's not as good as the iPad is this.
[00:33:41.160 --> 00:33:43.040]   I don't think they tried to make an iPad.
[00:33:43.040 --> 00:33:45.200]   I think the fact that you turn this on and what you see
[00:33:45.200 --> 00:33:49.080]   is your content and not a grid of app icons.
[00:33:49.080 --> 00:33:50.400]   I think that pretty much demonstrates
[00:33:50.400 --> 00:33:52.640]   that they design this as a content device.
[00:33:52.640 --> 00:33:55.120]   I can also download some really cool apps
[00:33:55.120 --> 00:33:58.760]   and do tablet-ish features.
[00:33:58.760 --> 00:34:02.520]   It has some limitations I think that are all due to the fact
[00:34:02.520 --> 00:34:04.960]   that it's running Android 2.3 underneath.
[00:34:04.960 --> 00:34:07.920]   So the interface, you wouldn't call it snappy.
[00:34:07.920 --> 00:34:08.920]   I don't think it's sluggish.
[00:34:08.920 --> 00:34:12.720]   But if you're used to that absolutely liquid experience
[00:34:12.720 --> 00:34:14.680]   of using the iPad interface--
[00:34:14.680 --> 00:34:16.760]   The page turned little hesitations in that.
[00:34:16.760 --> 00:34:17.600]   Yeah.
[00:34:17.600 --> 00:34:20.760]   And not only that, I'm talking about when tapping buttons,
[00:34:20.760 --> 00:34:22.440]   but it doesn't highlight immediately.
[00:34:22.440 --> 00:34:24.240]   Sometimes buttons don't highlight at all.
[00:34:24.240 --> 00:34:26.000]   It just simply goes off and does what you
[00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:27.880]   asked it to do without confirming to you that, oh, yes,
[00:34:27.880 --> 00:34:30.040]   by the way, the fact that I highlighted my button
[00:34:30.040 --> 00:34:31.600]   means that, yes, I'm actually doing something.
[00:34:31.600 --> 00:34:33.600]   You don't have to keep pressing it over and over again.
[00:34:33.600 --> 00:34:35.240]   Downloading the Netflix app before the show.
[00:34:35.240 --> 00:34:37.920]   I had to try to download it a few times.
[00:34:37.920 --> 00:34:38.400]   Did you?
[00:34:38.400 --> 00:34:40.280]   I had to press the button a few times.
[00:34:40.280 --> 00:34:43.200]   So kind of an unresponsive interface.
[00:34:43.200 --> 00:34:45.720]   This is, by the way, an Android app pulse.
[00:34:45.720 --> 00:34:48.240]   We've got it on the iOS as well.
[00:34:48.240 --> 00:34:48.800]   But it's nice.
[00:34:48.800 --> 00:34:52.040]   We're seeing some Android apps on here right away.
[00:34:52.040 --> 00:34:52.680]   Does it come with--
[00:34:52.680 --> 00:34:53.040]   Yeah, no.
[00:34:53.040 --> 00:34:54.360]   --is there-- did you download this, Liz?
[00:34:54.360 --> 00:34:55.160]   I don't know if she--
[00:34:55.160 --> 00:34:56.160]   It comes with pulse.
[00:34:56.160 --> 00:34:58.360]   It comes with IMDB.
[00:34:58.360 --> 00:35:00.880]   It comes with-- in addition to the browser and the email
[00:35:00.880 --> 00:35:06.200]   client, it comes with about three or four apps for music
[00:35:06.200 --> 00:35:08.000]   and news downloading.
[00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:10.000]   But they spent so much time vetting
[00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:13.640]   their entire Amazon App Store library
[00:35:13.640 --> 00:35:16.160]   just to check to make sure that these things actually
[00:35:16.160 --> 00:35:17.320]   work on the fire.
[00:35:17.320 --> 00:35:18.520]   Mostly they're just checking to see,
[00:35:18.520 --> 00:35:22.640]   look to weed out apps that expect to see a hardware that--
[00:35:22.640 --> 00:35:25.480]   on Android, the standard hardware buttons
[00:35:25.480 --> 00:35:26.400]   are on the bottom of the screen.
[00:35:26.400 --> 00:35:27.400]   This doesn't have that.
[00:35:27.400 --> 00:35:28.120]   Doesn't have a camera.
[00:35:28.120 --> 00:35:29.320]   It doesn't have a GPS.
[00:35:29.320 --> 00:35:32.760]   So apps that are expecting that have to be sort of vetted out.
[00:35:32.760 --> 00:35:35.680]   Also, hopefully, the sort of apps that
[00:35:35.680 --> 00:35:38.000]   are so hard formatted for a phone screen that
[00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:40.320]   looks terrible on a 7-inch tablet.
[00:35:40.320 --> 00:35:43.120]   And they were adding stuff all the way.
[00:35:43.120 --> 00:35:47.080]   It was only Sunday late afternoon
[00:35:47.080 --> 00:35:48.800]   that I got access to the Netflix app.
[00:35:48.800 --> 00:35:52.040]   That's how to the wire that they were adding stuff to it.
[00:35:52.040 --> 00:35:55.160]   The Comixology app, which is for brings--
[00:35:55.160 --> 00:35:59.160]   the iTunes of digital comic book stores to the fire.
[00:35:59.160 --> 00:36:02.000]   That was only made available to me like Sunday night.
[00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:04.600]   So they've really been working hard.
[00:36:04.600 --> 00:36:07.000]   The good news is it looks like you don't have to rewrite
[00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:08.120]   anything for the fire.
[00:36:08.120 --> 00:36:10.520]   If you'd like to do that, you can certainly optimize
[00:36:10.520 --> 00:36:11.200]   the experience.
[00:36:11.200 --> 00:36:13.920]   But you can take existing Android apps
[00:36:13.920 --> 00:36:15.600]   and just dump them on here until which is fine.
[00:36:15.600 --> 00:36:18.000]   You can even sideload apps from--
[00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:21.120]   if you can download-- if you push that magic button that's
[00:36:21.120 --> 00:36:23.280]   in most Android devices that says,
[00:36:23.280 --> 00:36:26.160]   trust download content from unsigned sources,
[00:36:26.160 --> 00:36:28.160]   you can still just download and install apps directly
[00:36:28.160 --> 00:36:28.920]   from a web browser.
[00:36:28.920 --> 00:36:30.720]   That's huge.
[00:36:30.720 --> 00:36:32.520]   You're taking your chances because not all of them
[00:36:32.520 --> 00:36:33.840]   work really well.
[00:36:33.840 --> 00:36:35.600]   But if you want, you don't have to necessarily
[00:36:35.600 --> 00:36:37.120]   have to wait for something to hit the Amazon store.
[00:36:37.120 --> 00:36:39.160]   It's a full Android device, then.
[00:36:39.160 --> 00:36:40.200]   That's interesting.
[00:36:40.200 --> 00:36:41.360]   It's a full Android device.
[00:36:41.360 --> 00:36:44.000]   But again, it's optimized for content consumption.
[00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:47.560]   It's optimized for books, video, and music and photos.
[00:36:47.560 --> 00:36:48.280]   Play splash.
[00:36:48.280 --> 00:36:49.520]   I was just playing a flash.
[00:36:49.520 --> 00:36:50.520]   Play splash.
[00:36:50.520 --> 00:36:51.480]   Play splash is fine.
[00:36:51.480 --> 00:36:52.800]   Yeah.
[00:36:52.800 --> 00:36:54.720]   I just-- and I love-- if you've been--
[00:36:54.720 --> 00:36:57.360]   it really does underscore that in this day and age,
[00:36:57.360 --> 00:36:59.240]   it's not only the hardware and it's not even just
[00:36:59.240 --> 00:37:02.080]   the operating system, but it's also the ecosystem around it.
[00:37:02.080 --> 00:37:05.440]   And the fact that I've spent so many years buying most
[00:37:05.440 --> 00:37:07.720]   of my music from the Amazon MP3 store,
[00:37:07.720 --> 00:37:10.440]   buying books from the Amazon Kindle store
[00:37:10.440 --> 00:37:12.560]   means that I took this out of the package
[00:37:12.560 --> 00:37:13.840]   and within five--
[00:37:13.840 --> 00:37:15.680]   within exactly this has never been--
[00:37:15.680 --> 00:37:17.480]   I'm sorry, rather, for the first couple of days,
[00:37:17.480 --> 00:37:20.040]   it wasn't even connected to any sort of a computer.
[00:37:20.040 --> 00:37:21.720]   And yet, every--
[00:37:21.720 --> 00:37:24.920]   the first time that you tap on the Steve Jobs book
[00:37:24.920 --> 00:37:27.720]   and immediately takes you to the page you were last on,
[00:37:27.720 --> 00:37:30.720]   when you read it on your iPad earlier that day, that's good.
[00:37:30.720 --> 00:37:34.520]   That's getting the experience right.
[00:37:34.520 --> 00:37:35.960]   How about the--
[00:37:35.960 --> 00:37:38.600]   I'm looking here at the newsstand, the magazines.
[00:37:38.600 --> 00:37:41.360]   That was one of the things we were very interested in, right?
[00:37:41.360 --> 00:37:43.480]   The magazines, I wouldn't call it a failure,
[00:37:43.480 --> 00:37:48.200]   but it's hard formatted content that's been--
[00:37:48.200 --> 00:37:51.160]   that was designed for a sheet of magazine print
[00:37:51.160 --> 00:37:54.080]   doesn't really translate very well to the seven-inch screen.
[00:37:54.080 --> 00:37:56.480]   You have to poke, you have to press, you have to squeeze,
[00:37:56.480 --> 00:37:59.200]   you got to zoom, and you got to tap a lot.
[00:37:59.200 --> 00:38:03.400]   And because, as we said, it's not a really liquid interface,
[00:38:03.400 --> 00:38:07.160]   it's a big pain in the butt to try to read a New Yorker article
[00:38:07.160 --> 00:38:09.960]   that's formatted across three printed columns
[00:38:09.960 --> 00:38:11.400]   across the width of the page.
[00:38:11.400 --> 00:38:13.080]   It gets old pretty fast.
[00:38:13.080 --> 00:38:17.640]   And so I'm not sure if I'll be buying a whole lot of magazine
[00:38:17.640 --> 00:38:18.120]   copies.
[00:38:18.120 --> 00:38:20.360]   Well, not until they start formatting for this page.
[00:38:20.360 --> 00:38:22.600]   I mean, they're formatting for the page
[00:38:22.600 --> 00:38:24.760]   or coming up with other solutions.
[00:38:24.760 --> 00:38:27.240]   The Comixology app actually works pretty well,
[00:38:27.240 --> 00:38:30.160]   because from day one, when they were formatting stuff
[00:38:30.160 --> 00:38:33.360]   or phones, they have-- in addition to the full screen view,
[00:38:33.360 --> 00:38:35.360]   they've always had what they call a guided view,
[00:38:35.360 --> 00:38:37.360]   so that you just keep tapping and sort of--
[00:38:37.360 --> 00:38:39.840]   they've programmed in camera movements, so to speak,
[00:38:39.840 --> 00:38:42.760]   they'll zoom in on one panel, then zoom a little bit out
[00:38:42.760 --> 00:38:44.960]   to see-- let you see more of that art,
[00:38:44.960 --> 00:38:48.600]   then move to the next panel in the dialogue.
[00:38:48.600 --> 00:38:50.720]   And so you want something that helps you all
[00:38:50.720 --> 00:38:53.200]   like that only with magazines.
[00:38:53.200 --> 00:38:55.160]   So hopefully this is just the first step.
[00:38:55.160 --> 00:38:56.800]   Zinnio is available on this as well.
[00:38:56.800 --> 00:38:57.960]   They announced immediately.
[00:38:57.960 --> 00:38:59.320]   Yes, you can download it.
[00:38:59.320 --> 00:39:01.280]   So it's a more-- I think one thing I know
[00:39:01.280 --> 00:39:04.080]   is a more open device than we maybe thought.
[00:39:04.080 --> 00:39:05.040]   It is Wi-Fi--
[00:39:05.040 --> 00:39:05.400]   It's great.
[00:39:05.400 --> 00:39:08.680]   It's not 3G, so you will be using your own Wi-Fi.
[00:39:08.680 --> 00:39:11.000]   They haven't yet released 3G versions,
[00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:12.680]   although I know those are coming, right?
[00:39:12.680 --> 00:39:13.720]   Yeah.
[00:39:13.720 --> 00:39:15.520]   Well, they haven't announced anything like that.
[00:39:15.520 --> 00:39:17.960]   I asked, and they declined to answer.
[00:39:17.960 --> 00:39:20.840]   But one of the biggest questions that I had was,
[00:39:20.840 --> 00:39:24.000]   are they going to be strategic about what apps they
[00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:25.320]   allow onto the device?
[00:39:25.320 --> 00:39:28.480]   And as far as I can tell, they have absolutely no problems
[00:39:28.480 --> 00:39:31.440]   with allowing in apps that would compete with Amazon Store
[00:39:31.440 --> 00:39:32.160]   content.
[00:39:32.160 --> 00:39:35.600]   So you can download a really good ePub reader that not only
[00:39:35.600 --> 00:39:39.720]   supports open ePub, but also supports Adobe DRM ePub content.
[00:39:39.720 --> 00:39:42.120]   So if you've been buying stuff from the Sony Reader Store,
[00:39:42.120 --> 00:39:42.640]   no problem.
[00:39:42.640 --> 00:39:44.040]   You can just install it on your Kindle
[00:39:44.040 --> 00:39:45.160]   and read it from there.
[00:39:45.160 --> 00:39:46.920]   That's always been my biggest complaint
[00:39:46.920 --> 00:39:50.440]   about the Kindle family is just that everybody--
[00:39:50.440 --> 00:39:53.400]   there's the Kindle book format, and then everybody else
[00:39:53.400 --> 00:39:55.160]   in the world uses the ePub format.
[00:39:55.160 --> 00:39:56.840]   So now we finally have something that at least has
[00:39:56.840 --> 00:39:59.920]   the word Kindle printed on it that can do just as well
[00:39:59.920 --> 00:40:03.280]   with ePubs as with Amazon Store content.
[00:40:03.280 --> 00:40:04.880]   This is a details magazine.
[00:40:04.880 --> 00:40:09.240]   One of a number of magazines that are offer free first editions
[00:40:09.240 --> 00:40:10.560]   for a look.
[00:40:10.560 --> 00:40:12.000]   And I see exactly what you're saying.
[00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:14.320]   I mean, really, this is like a PDF of the magazine.
[00:40:14.320 --> 00:40:16.000]   I have to zoom in double tap.
[00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:17.840]   I mean, this could be a web page.
[00:40:17.840 --> 00:40:18.960]   How's this silk browser?
[00:40:18.960 --> 00:40:20.960]   Because they made a lot of hay about how
[00:40:20.960 --> 00:40:23.400]   they were going to have this fancy new browser on it.
[00:40:23.400 --> 00:40:23.920]   Yeah.
[00:40:23.920 --> 00:40:25.840]   That was frustrating because I--
[00:40:25.840 --> 00:40:26.440]   man alive.
[00:40:26.440 --> 00:40:29.920]   I tested it out with the cloud-based acceleration turned on,
[00:40:29.920 --> 00:40:31.720]   the cloud-based acceleration turned off.
[00:40:31.720 --> 00:40:33.040]   The whole point of the silk browser
[00:40:33.040 --> 00:40:36.120]   is that it'll offload a lot of the work of downloading
[00:40:36.120 --> 00:40:39.520]   all the elements on web page to Amazon Cloud Services
[00:40:39.520 --> 00:40:41.920]   so that instead of this puny little mobile device
[00:40:41.920 --> 00:40:44.600]   having to download 20 elements, it's
[00:40:44.600 --> 00:40:46.520]   the servers that download all those 20 elements,
[00:40:46.520 --> 00:40:49.840]   then it pushes it all the way down to your Wi-Fi connection
[00:40:49.840 --> 00:40:51.000]   to the device.
[00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:53.520]   So I tried it with acceleration on, with it off.
[00:40:53.520 --> 00:40:56.000]   I tried, compared it to iOS.
[00:40:56.000 --> 00:40:57.320]   I compared it to desktops.
[00:40:57.320 --> 00:40:59.440]   I just couldn't find any consistency
[00:40:59.440 --> 00:41:01.240]   with the speed of the app.
[00:41:01.240 --> 00:41:05.760]   Just it just really ran for me as fast as any other browser did.
[00:41:05.760 --> 00:41:08.320]   So I don't know whether that's because they haven't really
[00:41:08.320 --> 00:41:09.720]   gotten it dialed in yet.
[00:41:09.720 --> 00:41:13.000]   Maybe part of it is because one of the optimizations
[00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:17.400]   that it does is to kind of crowdsource information
[00:41:17.400 --> 00:41:20.680]   from every Kindle Fire silk browser user
[00:41:20.680 --> 00:41:22.760]   to try to anticipate what you're going to be doing next.
[00:41:22.760 --> 00:41:26.000]   Like if you're on the top page of the Sun Time site,
[00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:28.120]   it's very, very likely that a very next thing you're going
[00:41:28.120 --> 00:41:31.080]   to tap is the link for Roger Ebert's blog.
[00:41:31.080 --> 00:41:32.800]   So it'll preload that in the background
[00:41:32.800 --> 00:41:34.320]   so that if you do tap that link, boom,
[00:41:34.320 --> 00:41:36.360]   it's liquid in this instant.
[00:41:36.360 --> 00:41:37.480]   So maybe this part of that there.
[00:41:37.480 --> 00:41:40.760]   But as far as-- from what they were talking about,
[00:41:40.760 --> 00:41:43.600]   and all the documentation they're putting up about how it works,
[00:41:43.600 --> 00:41:46.920]   it really should have been much faster than it actually was.
[00:41:46.920 --> 00:41:49.720]   But you do get one benefit built in
[00:41:49.720 --> 00:41:52.400]   because all the traffic in the accelerated mode
[00:41:52.400 --> 00:41:55.320]   between the silk browser on this device
[00:41:55.320 --> 00:41:57.680]   and on the cloud services, it's encrypted.
[00:41:57.680 --> 00:42:00.600]   So it's sort of like you're getting secure Wi-Fi
[00:42:00.600 --> 00:42:03.800]   in a secure connection, encrypted connection,
[00:42:03.800 --> 00:42:05.840]   even if you're on an open public Wi-Fi.
[00:42:05.840 --> 00:42:09.280]   It's not as secure as a VPN, but in terms of people
[00:42:09.280 --> 00:42:11.320]   in the coffee shop being able to sniff your traffic,
[00:42:11.320 --> 00:42:13.960]   that should make it almost impossible for the casual person
[00:42:13.960 --> 00:42:14.880]   to do that.
[00:42:14.880 --> 00:42:17.400]   I have to say, I think-- well, first of all,
[00:42:17.400 --> 00:42:20.280]   seven inches, it's kind of heavy and clunky, very much
[00:42:20.280 --> 00:42:22.160]   like a BlackBerry playbook.
[00:42:22.160 --> 00:42:24.960]   People who compare it to the iPad, I mean, it's going to--
[00:42:24.960 --> 00:42:26.800]   It's not going to compare well to the iPad.
[00:42:26.800 --> 00:42:28.840]   It's not a general purpose device by any means.
[00:42:28.840 --> 00:42:29.600]   It's a Kindle.
[00:42:29.600 --> 00:42:31.840]   Yeah, it doesn't feel like an iPad at all.
[00:42:31.840 --> 00:42:33.880]   I mean, I had the first reaction that you had.
[00:42:33.880 --> 00:42:35.280]   Wow, it's heavier than I thought it would be
[00:42:35.280 --> 00:42:37.160]   when I first picked it up.
[00:42:37.160 --> 00:42:41.280]   But after just navigating around for a few minutes--
[00:42:41.280 --> 00:42:43.200]   This is the playbook.
[00:42:43.200 --> 00:42:44.280]   It looks the same.
[00:42:44.280 --> 00:42:45.720]   There are people who are like,
[00:42:45.720 --> 00:42:47.480]   after I posted my review Sunday nights,
[00:42:47.480 --> 00:42:49.560]   I don't know, all they did was like rebrand the playbook.
[00:42:49.560 --> 00:42:50.400]   No, they didn't.
[00:42:50.400 --> 00:42:51.800]   It's a totally different device.
[00:42:51.800 --> 00:42:54.280]   I don't know if they owe him, I don't know if they basically
[00:42:54.280 --> 00:42:57.160]   had the same company build it, but it's really--
[00:42:57.160 --> 00:42:58.160]   They're totally different devices.
[00:42:58.160 --> 00:42:59.880]   So if people are paying 200 bucks for this,
[00:42:59.880 --> 00:43:01.880]   I mean, obviously, they know that there's $300 difference
[00:43:01.880 --> 00:43:03.040]   between this and an iPad.
[00:43:03.040 --> 00:43:05.760]   Are they getting what they expect?
[00:43:05.760 --> 00:43:07.640]   And are they going to buy it in droves?
[00:43:07.640 --> 00:43:10.800]   The story is that Amazon's making 5 million of them
[00:43:10.800 --> 00:43:12.560]   to sell for Christmas.
[00:43:12.560 --> 00:43:14.480]   Yeah, I think the question is going to be,
[00:43:14.480 --> 00:43:18.360]   if on December 21st, you can't buy one in time for Christmas,
[00:43:18.360 --> 00:43:21.200]   that's all they have to say about the success of the device.
[00:43:21.200 --> 00:43:23.560]   Because they've never talked about sales figures
[00:43:23.560 --> 00:43:26.440]   on previous kindles before, but a sellout is a sellout.
[00:43:26.440 --> 00:43:28.200]   I mean, I think I don't understand people
[00:43:28.200 --> 00:43:29.360]   who are comparing it to the iPad.
[00:43:29.360 --> 00:43:31.400]   I don't think that's not it.
[00:43:31.400 --> 00:43:31.920]   Exactly.
[00:43:31.920 --> 00:43:33.320]   Well, not only that, but each of these devices
[00:43:33.320 --> 00:43:35.640]   can't compare favorably to each other.
[00:43:35.640 --> 00:43:37.720]   Because if I decide that I don't like the iPad,
[00:43:37.720 --> 00:43:39.760]   and I want to say that this is a better device,
[00:43:39.760 --> 00:43:43.520]   all I have to say is $200 and you can stick it in your pocket.
[00:43:43.520 --> 00:43:46.320]   And for that, a lot of people who might have looked at the iPad
[00:43:46.320 --> 00:43:48.120]   but decided, no, this isn't for me,
[00:43:48.120 --> 00:43:50.680]   are going to say, no, this is exactly the device I'm looking for.
[00:43:50.680 --> 00:43:52.720]   I like to have a word processor for it
[00:43:52.720 --> 00:43:53.920]   so I can download.
[00:43:53.920 --> 00:43:56.400]   If someone wants to email me a document as a text attachment,
[00:43:56.400 --> 00:43:58.560]   I can do an edit and then email it back.
[00:43:58.560 --> 00:44:01.480]   But I don't need a real post-PC computing device.
[00:44:01.480 --> 00:44:04.200]   I really just want a tablet computer for consuming media.
[00:44:04.200 --> 00:44:06.880]   So I think they compliment each other very, very nicely
[00:44:06.880 --> 00:44:07.480]   in the marketplace.
[00:44:07.480 --> 00:44:09.120]   I don't think they really compete with each other.
[00:44:09.120 --> 00:44:10.760]   Well, think about all the Kindle faithfuls already.
[00:44:10.760 --> 00:44:14.240]   People who love their kindles, they read their books exclusively,
[00:44:14.240 --> 00:44:16.600]   or at least most of the time on their kindles.
[00:44:16.600 --> 00:44:19.560]   This is something that you still have a great reading
[00:44:19.560 --> 00:44:21.920]   consumption device, but it does a lot more.
[00:44:21.920 --> 00:44:22.760]   I don't know.
[00:44:22.760 --> 00:44:24.520]   I think there are a lot of Kindle people, and I might include myself,
[00:44:24.520 --> 00:44:27.200]   who one of the reasons we like the Kindle is it's very light,
[00:44:27.200 --> 00:44:29.440]   very thin, and it's eating.
[00:44:29.440 --> 00:44:32.040]   And this is not that.
[00:44:32.040 --> 00:44:33.880]   Well, and but they remember that they still have,
[00:44:33.880 --> 00:44:36.960]   I've gotten in the other room, but they still have a brand new line
[00:44:36.960 --> 00:44:38.000]   of kindles.
[00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:38.520]   Right.
[00:44:38.520 --> 00:44:39.240]   Which I love.
[00:44:39.240 --> 00:44:43.320]   They're cheap 79 bucks or touch version for only a little bit more than that.
[00:44:43.320 --> 00:44:43.720]   So yeah.
[00:44:43.720 --> 00:44:43.720]   Yeah.
[00:44:43.720 --> 00:44:47.040]   Basic Kindle to me is exactly what I want.
[00:44:47.040 --> 00:44:49.840]   And I already bought this, but now that I've played with it,
[00:44:49.840 --> 00:44:53.120]   I'm thinking, I don't know if I would use it very much.
[00:44:53.120 --> 00:44:56.800]   It's not something that I would need because I have an iPad.
[00:44:56.800 --> 00:45:01.240]   I think, especially for the gift season, the price is really attractive.
[00:45:01.240 --> 00:45:05.040]   Somebody in chat mentioned, if it's something that you don't want a little kid
[00:45:05.040 --> 00:45:09.040]   to break, this seems like it makes more sense.
[00:45:09.040 --> 00:45:14.200]   But then again, and I know that Amazon's App Store will only get better,
[00:45:14.200 --> 00:45:19.800]   but there's really no comparing to what iOS can offer you at this point.
[00:45:19.800 --> 00:45:21.880]   I think also is what you want to do.
[00:45:21.880 --> 00:45:22.400]   Yeah.
[00:45:22.400 --> 00:45:26.560]   One thing with the fire in the iPad, I think with the iPad, people don't,
[00:45:26.560 --> 00:45:28.880]   in some cases, they don't really know why they need the iPad,
[00:45:28.880 --> 00:45:30.880]   because they're such a wide ranging device.
[00:45:30.880 --> 00:45:33.640]   You know, you can read books and you can listen to music, you can watch movies,
[00:45:33.640 --> 00:45:36.640]   but there's so much more because of the apps, you know, the apps are available.
[00:45:36.640 --> 00:45:39.520]   So people, I think, sort of buy it because they've heard it's a great device,
[00:45:39.520 --> 00:45:42.400]   and they think it might fit in with their lifestyle,
[00:45:42.400 --> 00:45:43.640]   and they might be able to use it for this and that.
[00:45:43.640 --> 00:45:46.360]   And then when they do find it, when they do get it, you know, it does fit in
[00:45:46.360 --> 00:45:47.600]   because it's very malleable.
[00:45:47.600 --> 00:45:50.360]   You can actually mold it to do whatever you want it to do.
[00:45:50.360 --> 00:45:53.800]   Whereas with the fire, it's very, it's, it's niche is defined.
[00:45:53.800 --> 00:45:55.680]   It is to consume media.
[00:45:55.680 --> 00:45:56.640]   It's your book reader.
[00:45:56.640 --> 00:45:57.960]   It's your movie watcher.
[00:45:57.960 --> 00:46:01.240]   And I think that's going to make the decision point for a lot of people to say,
[00:46:01.240 --> 00:46:04.040]   yeah, actually, I could, you know, I could see myself using a fire,
[00:46:04.040 --> 00:46:07.640]   whereas in before they might say, well, the iPad is a bit expensive,
[00:46:07.640 --> 00:46:09.400]   and I don't really know what I'm going to use it for.
[00:46:09.400 --> 00:46:10.760]   So I'll probably go with the fire.
[00:46:10.760 --> 00:46:14.560]   Now, with the note that will cannibalize, I doubt it will actually cannibalize iPad sales,
[00:46:14.560 --> 00:46:19.000]   but it just seems a great alternative for people who don't really quite
[00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:21.840]   glom onto the fact, you know, what can you actually do with an iPad?
[00:46:21.840 --> 00:46:22.560]   Absolutely.
[00:46:22.560 --> 00:46:25.920]   I think the biggest advantage that it has is the simple word Kindle.
[00:46:25.920 --> 00:46:29.800]   I mean, Amazon did something that only Apple, I think, has done previously,
[00:46:29.800 --> 00:46:34.920]   where there was a broad category of products called digital music players.
[00:46:34.920 --> 00:46:38.960]   But as soon as the iPod came out, every digital music player became called the iPod.
[00:46:38.960 --> 00:46:41.480]   Similarly, people don't think of an electronic book reader.
[00:46:41.480 --> 00:46:44.200]   They think of a Kindle and maybe they have a Kindle that's made by
[00:46:44.200 --> 00:46:47.200]   a Kobo, maybe they have a Kindle made by Sony, but they think Kindle.
[00:46:47.200 --> 00:46:52.080]   So the person that they know who has an ebook reader probably already has a Kindle
[00:46:52.080 --> 00:46:56.480]   and that will sort of introduce them to say, well, why would I buy any other book reader,
[00:46:56.480 --> 00:46:59.040]   but the ones that I see everybody else trying to use?
[00:46:59.040 --> 00:47:02.600]   It's a nice word with friends game.
[00:47:02.600 --> 00:47:04.400]   Well, hey, you know what?
[00:47:04.400 --> 00:47:05.640]   Don't knock it.
[00:47:05.640 --> 00:47:11.360]   Because there's a few games that, I mean, look, you know, if you could play like the three
[00:47:11.360 --> 00:47:15.120]   games that people really care about or a person really cares about, then it might be a good
[00:47:15.120 --> 00:47:16.320]   choice, you know?
[00:47:16.320 --> 00:47:17.320]   Well, that's it.
[00:47:17.320 --> 00:47:23.640]   I think it was a recent Wired article where Jeff Bezos was quoted as saying that it was,
[00:47:23.640 --> 00:47:30.600]   he saw the fire as a media service, not even a device, a media service where you, you know,
[00:47:30.600 --> 00:47:36.360]   you can read, you can watch videos, you can play some games, you can buy from Amazon,
[00:47:36.360 --> 00:47:40.760]   everything as far as the Amazon ecosystem is with you and it's mobile.
[00:47:40.760 --> 00:47:41.760]   Right.
[00:47:41.760 --> 00:47:43.440]   But it's a service more than it's actually a thing.
[00:47:43.440 --> 00:47:44.440]   It's a portal.
[00:47:44.440 --> 00:47:47.000]   Yes, it's a portal to the Amazon.
[00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:51.720]   You didn't even hear Amazon just talk about themselves as a cloud services company until
[00:47:51.720 --> 00:47:53.600]   they introduced the Kindle Fire.
[00:47:53.600 --> 00:47:55.600]   So that's a pretty clear statement, isn't it?
[00:47:55.600 --> 00:48:00.120]   All right, enough about the Kindle, but I mean, I thought given that it's being positioned
[00:48:00.120 --> 00:48:03.120]   by some as an iPad killer, I thought it was appropriate to talk about it.
[00:48:03.120 --> 00:48:06.160]   I think this will appear in a lot of stockings at 200 bucks.
[00:48:06.160 --> 00:48:08.720]   But if you have it, and it will fit.
[00:48:08.720 --> 00:48:12.880]   But if you have an iPad, there is absolutely no reason to get this, right?
[00:48:12.880 --> 00:48:13.880]   I don't agree.
[00:48:13.880 --> 00:48:14.880]   I would agree.
[00:48:14.880 --> 00:48:15.880]   Why would you get it?
[00:48:15.880 --> 00:48:16.880]   I don't know.
[00:48:16.880 --> 00:48:17.880]   Yeah.
[00:48:17.880 --> 00:48:21.560]   So I mean, the only reason I would want it is if for some reason there was a, I couldn't
[00:48:21.560 --> 00:48:24.280]   travel with this and that's just not the case.
[00:48:24.280 --> 00:48:25.280]   Right.
[00:48:25.280 --> 00:48:26.280]   Right.
[00:48:26.280 --> 00:48:27.280]   All right.
[00:48:27.280 --> 00:48:28.280]   There we go.
[00:48:28.280 --> 00:48:30.880]   We're going to take another break, come back with more.
[00:48:30.880 --> 00:48:31.880]   Notice it plays flash.
[00:48:31.880 --> 00:48:36.280]   Just this may be, maybe one of the few devices that still plays flash.
[00:48:36.280 --> 00:48:41.240]   Adobe Blames Apple, at least one manager at Adobe Blames Apple for the death of flash.
[00:48:41.240 --> 00:48:42.880]   We'll talk about that.
[00:48:42.880 --> 00:48:45.360]   Lingering battery complaints with iOS 5.
[00:48:45.360 --> 00:48:47.600]   I'll be curious what your results are.
[00:48:47.600 --> 00:48:52.320]   And I don't know about you, but I've been having other issues with iOS 5, that I, 501,
[00:48:52.320 --> 00:48:54.120]   that I didn't have.
[00:48:54.120 --> 00:48:59.920]   I think 501 may have broken some things more to come in just a bit as we continue with
[00:48:59.920 --> 00:49:00.920]   Macbreak Weekly.
[00:49:00.920 --> 00:49:02.560]   And he and not goes here from the Chicago Sun.
[00:49:02.560 --> 00:49:06.800]   I'm Sarah Lane from TNT, the social hour I had today.
[00:49:06.800 --> 00:49:08.000]   Am I missing anything?
[00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:09.000]   No.
[00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:10.000]   And, and I am.
[00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:12.800]   I am sure I'll get on a show eventually.
[00:49:12.800 --> 00:49:19.840]   Sarah Lane of Facebook fame and from screencasts online, missed a Donnie McAllister.
[00:49:19.840 --> 00:49:24.560]   So we're going to take a break right now and talk a little bit about the folks at Gazelle.
[00:49:24.560 --> 00:49:30.680]   You know, I have to say one of the pain points of moving to a new device like the fire is
[00:49:30.680 --> 00:49:34.920]   having an old device and thinking about, oh, you know, did I get my money's worth?
[00:49:34.920 --> 00:49:37.280]   And what am I going to do with the old device?
[00:49:37.280 --> 00:49:40.640]   And that's where Gazelle.com is so fantastic.
[00:49:40.640 --> 00:49:43.560]   Visit it right now, G-A-Z-E-L-L-E.com.
[00:49:43.560 --> 00:49:45.560]   I think you can see my screen now.
[00:49:45.560 --> 00:49:46.560]   Can you?
[00:49:46.560 --> 00:49:50.880]   I'm wondering if it's a system setting for you because I see a blue screen.
[00:49:50.880 --> 00:49:51.880]   This is what I see.
[00:49:51.880 --> 00:49:53.880]   Well, that's not me.
[00:49:53.880 --> 00:49:56.600]   But I'm wondering, I mean, I can see that it's connected.
[00:49:56.600 --> 00:49:59.440]   Yeah, I connected it up.
[00:49:59.440 --> 00:50:00.440]   That's very strange.
[00:50:00.440 --> 00:50:01.440]   I have played around with various--
[00:50:01.440 --> 00:50:03.720]   Oh, I don't know what to say.
[00:50:03.720 --> 00:50:04.720]   I just befuddled.
[00:50:04.720 --> 00:50:05.720]   Sorry, Leo.
[00:50:05.720 --> 00:50:06.720]   I'm befuddled.
[00:50:06.720 --> 00:50:07.720]   Well, you show it then, Gazelle.com.
[00:50:07.720 --> 00:50:08.720]   I am a video show.
[00:50:08.720 --> 00:50:13.360]   I know you have it on your browser, G-A-Z-E-L-L-E.com.
[00:50:13.360 --> 00:50:17.680]   When you go there, you could pick an object like, oh, I don't know.
[00:50:17.680 --> 00:50:19.240]   Let's say you want to sell your iPad.
[00:50:19.240 --> 00:50:23.040]   Maybe you've decided that the iPad is just not the future for you.
[00:50:23.040 --> 00:50:25.320]   You want a Kindle fire.
[00:50:25.320 --> 00:50:26.320]   Which iPad?
[00:50:26.320 --> 00:50:27.520]   Oh, any-- pick one.
[00:50:27.520 --> 00:50:28.520]   You see that?
[00:50:28.520 --> 00:50:31.520]   It's a type IPAD, and it sees all the different models of iPad.
[00:50:31.520 --> 00:50:33.800]   You pick the one you want to sell.
[00:50:33.800 --> 00:50:36.800]   And then you'd give it some information about the condition, all the stuff.
[00:50:36.800 --> 00:50:41.560]   Yes, it's completely-- it completely-- no, it's-- yeah, that's fine.
[00:50:41.560 --> 00:50:42.560]   Noticable.
[00:50:42.560 --> 00:50:44.920]   And then you could say, well, what does it look like?
[00:50:44.920 --> 00:50:45.920]   Things like that.
[00:50:45.920 --> 00:50:49.600]   Now, one of the things people worry about is, well, what happens if I still have data on
[00:50:49.600 --> 00:50:50.600]   it?
[00:50:50.600 --> 00:50:51.600]   Don't worry.
[00:50:51.600 --> 00:50:54.280]   They're data experts as they evaluate the product.
[00:50:54.280 --> 00:50:55.280]   Look at that.
[00:50:55.280 --> 00:50:56.280]   218 bucks.
[00:50:56.280 --> 00:50:58.040]   That'll buy you right there, a Kindle fire.
[00:50:58.040 --> 00:50:59.040]   Boom.
[00:50:59.040 --> 00:51:00.040]   Boo-yah.
[00:51:00.040 --> 00:51:01.040]   Bow.
[00:51:01.040 --> 00:51:02.040]   Damn.
[00:51:02.040 --> 00:51:07.400]   And you get 18 bucks to spare for shipping, or a few lattes.
[00:51:07.400 --> 00:51:10.880]   I think this is-- I mean, it's pretty much-- how are you going to get that amount of money
[00:51:10.880 --> 00:51:11.880]   anywhere else?
[00:51:11.880 --> 00:51:12.880]   I agree.
[00:51:12.880 --> 00:51:13.880]   It's tons of gazelle.
[00:51:13.880 --> 00:51:14.880]   Well, you know, and people say that sometimes.
[00:51:14.880 --> 00:51:18.040]   They say, well, I could just go on eBay and sell it, and you may make more money, but
[00:51:18.040 --> 00:51:21.280]   boy, it's not-- it's so easy, because what you do now is--
[00:51:21.280 --> 00:51:22.280]   There's more hassle.
[00:51:22.280 --> 00:51:23.280]   Yeah, so that's the tradeoff.
[00:51:23.280 --> 00:51:26.560]   You want to make 20 bucks more, but you do all the work go right ahead, be my guess.
[00:51:26.560 --> 00:51:28.600]   It's all you do here is you put it in a box.
[00:51:28.600 --> 00:51:29.600]   They pay the shipping.
[00:51:29.600 --> 00:51:31.360]   They get a shipping label.
[00:51:31.360 --> 00:51:32.360]   You can put a lot of things.
[00:51:32.360 --> 00:51:35.440]   In fact, I would recommend going through your closet and just everything old that you can
[00:51:35.440 --> 00:51:39.840]   find that you don't want anymore, even if it has no value, because gazelle recycles
[00:51:39.840 --> 00:51:40.840]   it.
[00:51:40.840 --> 00:51:41.840]   Oh, gross.
[00:51:41.840 --> 00:51:42.840]   Recycles it.
[00:51:42.840 --> 00:51:44.280]   You know, whenever I get excited about something, I sneeze.
[00:51:44.280 --> 00:51:45.280]   That's a sign that I'm really excited about.
[00:51:45.280 --> 00:51:47.040]   Well, I think I'm done with my tea.
[00:51:47.040 --> 00:51:49.800]   I covered my sneeze into my--
[00:51:49.800 --> 00:51:50.800]   Eh.
[00:51:50.800 --> 00:51:51.800]   Did I hit it?
[00:51:51.800 --> 00:51:52.800]   Did I hit it?
[00:51:52.800 --> 00:51:53.800]   You think I hit it?
[00:51:53.800 --> 00:51:54.800]   I don't know.
[00:51:54.800 --> 00:51:55.800]   I'm just not going to let's not.
[00:51:55.800 --> 00:51:57.560]   You want some water?
[00:51:57.560 --> 00:51:58.560]   No.
[00:51:58.560 --> 00:51:59.560]   That was even closer.
[00:51:59.560 --> 00:52:01.240]   So here, have my hanky.
[00:52:01.240 --> 00:52:04.680]   So now see, this would have no value on gazelle.
[00:52:04.680 --> 00:52:09.680]   So that's what would happen is they would recycle it and they do it by the way, no landfill.
[00:52:09.680 --> 00:52:12.800]   This is the best electronics recycling out there.
[00:52:12.800 --> 00:52:14.360]   They don't send it overseas.
[00:52:14.360 --> 00:52:17.320]   They don't, you know, put it in the landfill.
[00:52:17.320 --> 00:52:21.640]   They take it apart, get the component stuff out of it, and you can be sure that you're
[00:52:21.640 --> 00:52:24.280]   getting the best electronics recycling if it has no value.
[00:52:24.280 --> 00:52:29.120]   Get the value for your objects, your former objects of desire.
[00:52:29.120 --> 00:52:31.160]   Recycle appropriately if it's unusable.
[00:52:31.160 --> 00:52:32.560]   Gazelle is fantastic.
[00:52:32.560 --> 00:52:38.200]   And don't forget, you can even create a charity page for your school or your organization
[00:52:38.200 --> 00:52:39.520]   and have a gadget drive.
[00:52:39.520 --> 00:52:42.200]   Send people to the special page and raise money that way.
[00:52:42.200 --> 00:52:43.840]   It's really fantastic.
[00:52:43.840 --> 00:52:50.400]   Gadgets in 20 product categories, 200,000 unique items, iPhones going from, say, $122
[00:52:50.400 --> 00:52:55.000]   to 163 bucks, the iPod Touch 4G, 107 bucks.
[00:52:55.000 --> 00:53:00.200]   You want to get rid of your Android phone and go iPhone, HTC sensation, 4G, $195.
[00:53:00.200 --> 00:53:03.960]   The Droid Bionic, $290 bucks.
[00:53:03.960 --> 00:53:06.680]   I mean, I could just go on and on gazelle.com.
[00:53:06.680 --> 00:53:08.160]   Don't sell it, gazelle.
[00:53:08.160 --> 00:53:12.400]   G-A-Z-E-L-L-E.com.
[00:53:12.400 --> 00:53:13.400]   Nice people too.
[00:53:13.400 --> 00:53:16.600]   I really like gazelle.
[00:53:16.600 --> 00:53:22.040]   I think we talked about this last week, the fact that, of course, from the grave, Steve
[00:53:22.040 --> 00:53:25.920]   Jobs can declare victory because Adobe declared Flash is dead.
[00:53:25.920 --> 00:53:27.920]   I think they declared it dead last Wednesday.
[00:53:27.920 --> 00:53:31.600]   Last week, so we didn't get a chance to talk.
[00:53:31.600 --> 00:53:35.560]   Adobe product manager pointed to the fact that Apple had refused to support Flash on
[00:53:35.560 --> 00:53:38.320]   iOS as a major reason.
[00:53:38.320 --> 00:53:43.640]   Mike Chambers, principal product manager for developer relations for the Flash platform,
[00:53:43.640 --> 00:53:44.640]   posted a blog post.
[00:53:44.640 --> 00:53:45.640]   Yeah, you're right.
[00:53:45.640 --> 00:53:46.640]   It was Wednesday.
[00:53:46.640 --> 00:53:50.760]   Adobe said it will continue to support existing implementations.
[00:53:50.760 --> 00:53:55.080]   So the Flash 11 that you have on your Android device will continue to work, but it's going
[00:53:55.080 --> 00:54:00.080]   to cease development on mobile in order to redirect resources to better focus on HTML
[00:54:00.080 --> 00:54:01.080]   5.
[00:54:01.080 --> 00:54:05.760]   But I got to say, if you're, I mean, just think it through, think the chess game through,
[00:54:05.760 --> 00:54:08.840]   you kill it on mobile, more and more people surf with mobile.
[00:54:08.840 --> 00:54:12.640]   If I have Flash on my website, even if it's still available on the desktop, am I going
[00:54:12.640 --> 00:54:13.640]   to use it?
[00:54:13.640 --> 00:54:14.640]   Hell no.
[00:54:14.640 --> 00:54:16.600]   It's dead all over.
[00:54:16.600 --> 00:54:22.120]   It has to be dead because we're just going to consume more on our mobile devices.
[00:54:22.120 --> 00:54:27.480]   Restaurant menus, those wonderful, beautiful Flash restaurant menus, we all know them and
[00:54:27.480 --> 00:54:28.480]   hate them.
[00:54:28.480 --> 00:54:29.480]   Yeah.
[00:54:29.480 --> 00:54:32.400]   All the time, especially when I'm going to a new city and I'm trying to figure out where
[00:54:32.400 --> 00:54:36.320]   all the pieces that I'm going to go, I'm looking at everything on my iPad and it's like
[00:54:36.320 --> 00:54:37.760]   I just bounce right on out of there.
[00:54:37.760 --> 00:54:41.680]   There are so many websites that are just absolutely useless to me.
[00:54:41.680 --> 00:54:43.160]   And iOS did help kill Flash.
[00:54:43.160 --> 00:54:47.040]   I mean, this Adobe manager is not telling us anything that we don't already know.
[00:54:47.040 --> 00:54:48.040]   Yeah.
[00:54:48.040 --> 00:54:49.040]   Of course.
[00:54:49.040 --> 00:54:50.040]   That's the end.
[00:54:50.040 --> 00:54:54.920]   By the way, is this, did I press a button or does the Kindle Fire go into trailer mode
[00:54:54.920 --> 00:54:55.920]   for a screensaver?
[00:54:55.920 --> 00:54:58.200]   Because I'm getting a Harry Potter trailer now.
[00:54:58.200 --> 00:54:59.200]   Is that what it does, Andy?
[00:54:59.200 --> 00:55:00.200]   No, it doesn't.
[00:55:00.200 --> 00:55:02.400]   That must be a very weird feature.
[00:55:02.400 --> 00:55:05.920]   No, it would be a great feature.
[00:55:05.920 --> 00:55:06.920]   No, it wouldn't.
[00:55:06.920 --> 00:55:07.920]   What if you're sleeping?
[00:55:07.920 --> 00:55:08.920]   Oh, yeah, you're right.
[00:55:08.920 --> 00:55:09.920]   Never mind.
[00:55:09.920 --> 00:55:10.920]   I can tell you that I've never had that.
[00:55:10.920 --> 00:55:11.920]   I've never made that happen.
[00:55:11.920 --> 00:55:14.080]   I didn't touch anything.
[00:55:14.080 --> 00:55:16.360]   It's also not an upcoming movie.
[00:55:16.360 --> 00:55:17.360]   That's true.
[00:55:17.360 --> 00:55:20.000]   So why would it even do that?
[00:55:20.000 --> 00:55:21.000]   Yeah.
[00:55:21.000 --> 00:55:22.000]   All right.
[00:55:22.000 --> 00:55:23.000]   Chambers, I feel bad for Mike.
[00:55:23.000 --> 00:55:27.480]   He spent the past 12 or 13 years working with the technology as part of the Flash community.
[00:55:27.480 --> 00:55:30.880]   According to him, the past couple of days have been some of the most difficult of his
[00:55:30.880 --> 00:55:31.880]   career.
[00:55:31.880 --> 00:55:37.440]   There will be, I'm sure, many jobs lost at Adobe.
[00:55:37.440 --> 00:55:41.840]   He says, "Considering how politically charged the issue has been the decision to stop development
[00:55:41.840 --> 00:55:46.480]   of the Flash player for mobile web browsers was not an easy decision.
[00:55:46.480 --> 00:55:49.560]   However, at the end of the day, there were a number of items that made it clear that
[00:55:49.560 --> 00:55:54.360]   putting resources toward its continued development would not be the best use of resources at
[00:55:54.360 --> 00:55:55.360]   Adobe."
[00:55:55.360 --> 00:55:59.960]   The first reason he said is the fact that Flash would never achieve the same ubiquity
[00:55:59.960 --> 00:56:01.960]   on mobile devices it has on the desktop.
[00:56:01.960 --> 00:56:07.080]   Yeah, because half of all mobile devices are iOS.
[00:56:07.080 --> 00:56:10.200]   This one should be pretty apparent, but given the fragmentation of the mobile market,
[00:56:10.200 --> 00:56:14.400]   he says, and the fact that one of the leading mobile platforms, Apple's iOS, was not going
[00:56:14.400 --> 00:56:16.520]   to allow the Flash player in the browser.
[00:56:16.520 --> 00:56:20.400]   The Flash player was not on track to read anywhere near the ubiquity of the Flash player
[00:56:20.400 --> 00:56:21.400]   in the desk.
[00:56:21.400 --> 00:56:24.120]   There's an interesting blog post by somebody who said, "You know, Adobe's big mistake
[00:56:24.120 --> 00:56:28.600]   was doing this Flash light player with NTT Dokomo in Japan.
[00:56:28.600 --> 00:56:33.000]   They put it on their feature phones and it fragmented the Flash market right out of the
[00:56:33.000 --> 00:56:37.760]   gate on mobile and that really Adobe killed Flash, not Apple.
[00:56:37.760 --> 00:56:39.520]   Adobe was the one that blew it."
[00:56:39.520 --> 00:56:45.200]   Well, they're going to need a lot of things in the world to go their way in order to continue
[00:56:45.200 --> 00:56:53.560]   with Flash because it really is the non-involvement of Apple and the fact that Flash would just
[00:56:53.560 --> 00:56:58.520]   by definition, unless Apple back down have absolutely no relevance for mobile computing.
[00:56:58.520 --> 00:56:59.960]   That really just did it in.
[00:56:59.960 --> 00:57:06.440]   But I'm still someone on Twitter through back when my comments back at me from earlier
[00:57:06.440 --> 00:57:11.280]   of the year because when the BlackBerry playbook and another Android tablet came out, I tested
[00:57:11.280 --> 00:57:16.680]   out Flash on both devices and said, "Well, we all know what Steve Jobs has said that Flash
[00:57:16.680 --> 00:57:17.680]   would never work on mobile.
[00:57:17.680 --> 00:57:18.680]   It'll kill the battery.
[00:57:18.680 --> 00:57:19.680]   It won't work properly.
[00:57:19.680 --> 00:57:23.880]   It'll be a terrible experience and I can tell you that, well, I've been watching two
[00:57:23.880 --> 00:57:28.720]   or three hours' worth of Conan O'Brien show off a TBS site, which I can't do on my iPad.
[00:57:28.720 --> 00:57:29.960]   It didn't kill the battery.
[00:57:29.960 --> 00:57:31.720]   It didn't cause it to overheat.
[00:57:31.720 --> 00:57:32.720]   It worked just.
[00:57:32.720 --> 00:57:36.760]   About first 30 seconds were terrible, but after Buffett, it worked just fine.
[00:57:36.760 --> 00:57:38.760]   I'm a little bit conflicted.
[00:57:38.760 --> 00:57:43.440]   Obviously, I agree with the point that Adobe would never have stopped doing mobile Flash,
[00:57:43.440 --> 00:57:45.400]   had Apple not put its foot down.
[00:57:45.400 --> 00:57:51.560]   But in the meantime, you wind up with a device that you paid $500 for that can't access a
[00:57:51.560 --> 00:57:57.720]   huge amount of really desirable content only because the company that took your $500 decided
[00:57:57.720 --> 00:58:00.800]   that they wanted to make a political gesture.
[00:58:00.800 --> 00:58:07.000]   Hopefully, and I don't think that they can get all the credit for the transition to HTML
[00:58:07.000 --> 00:58:10.040]   5 because that was already really well underway.
[00:58:10.040 --> 00:58:18.040]   I was talking to last year a lot of people who do internet video not just for corporate
[00:58:18.040 --> 00:58:22.720]   sites but also for main networks, like actual big popular TV shows.
[00:58:22.720 --> 00:58:27.760]   They said that, well, their infrastructure was accommodating both Flash and HTML5 all
[00:58:27.760 --> 00:58:28.760]   along.
[00:58:28.760 --> 00:58:30.760]   That was basically something they've been thinking of.
[00:58:30.760 --> 00:58:36.360]   I'm glad it's dead because if nothing else, it'll convince so many of these, like you
[00:58:36.360 --> 00:58:41.720]   said, these restaurant websites to say, what if you don't have the first 30 seconds of
[00:58:41.720 --> 00:58:45.960]   your experience not be a hand comes in and lights a candle and it just sort of curves
[00:58:45.960 --> 00:58:46.960]   into the chef's head?
[00:58:46.960 --> 00:58:49.200]   Like, how about you tell it's 730?
[00:58:49.200 --> 00:58:52.240]   What if you tell me if you're open until 10 or not?
[00:58:52.240 --> 00:58:55.160]   No, it's so true.
[00:58:55.160 --> 00:59:00.080]   That is a good point though that I mean, this isn't just Apple saying we don't want
[00:59:00.080 --> 00:59:01.080]   anything to do with Flash.
[00:59:01.080 --> 00:59:02.640]   I mean, look at Google.
[00:59:02.640 --> 00:59:06.120]   Google is one of the biggest HTML5 champions out there.
[00:59:06.120 --> 00:59:07.960]   But is HTML5 ready to take over?
[00:59:07.960 --> 00:59:10.240]   I mean, that's the other question.
[00:59:10.240 --> 00:59:14.240]   Technically, it's ready but the other factor is that there aren't as many people who are
[00:59:14.240 --> 00:59:17.080]   staffed up and ready to code to do.
[00:59:17.080 --> 00:59:19.600]   They're not the same library of people.
[00:59:19.600 --> 00:59:24.880]   Not the same army of people who are as experienced with HTML5 as they are experienced in developing
[00:59:24.880 --> 00:59:25.880]   for Flash.
[00:59:25.880 --> 00:59:28.600]   We don't have a video codec standard for HTML5 yet.
[00:59:28.600 --> 00:59:29.600]   I mean, there's things missing.
[00:59:29.600 --> 00:59:31.920]   Well, you don't necessarily need one.
[00:59:31.920 --> 00:59:34.840]   As long as you just simply have the wrapper to find them, put in whatever you want to
[00:59:34.840 --> 00:59:35.840]   define.
[00:59:35.840 --> 00:59:40.880]   Also, the other big one is that I think that Apple gets, I would not give them as much
[00:59:40.880 --> 00:59:46.000]   credit for killing Flash as I would for the simple idea to say, we're going to develop
[00:59:46.000 --> 00:59:50.400]   a browser engine called WebKit that we're going to give away to everybody so that every
[00:59:50.400 --> 00:59:56.840]   single device out there and most desktops out there can all be a hugely, studly HTML5
[00:59:56.840 --> 00:59:58.140]   rendering engine.
[00:59:58.140 --> 01:00:04.260]   The fact that no matter what sort of device that you want to navigate the web on, including
[01:00:04.260 --> 01:00:10.000]   the Kindle Fire, it will be the most HTML5 happy experience ever.
[01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:15.160]   More than simply declining to support Flash, it was just the fact that everybody who wants
[01:00:15.160 --> 01:00:19.520]   to put a web browser on any sort of device will have the ability to do great video without
[01:00:19.520 --> 01:00:21.720]   supporting Flash directly.
[01:00:21.720 --> 01:00:25.920]   That I think was the blow that really struck home.
[01:00:25.920 --> 01:00:29.820]   I think we have to say that Flash is dead on the desktop even though Chrome builds in Flash
[01:00:29.820 --> 01:00:33.140]   and Adobe is saying, "Oh no, we're going to keep developing for the desktop."
[01:00:33.140 --> 01:00:38.500]   I guess maybe Adobe Air or something, but I just don't see it on the desktop.
[01:00:38.500 --> 01:00:41.340]   It's not going to be on web pages anymore.
[01:00:41.340 --> 01:00:49.540]   Well, we also have to deal with Netflix uses Silverlight, which is not in the same sort
[01:00:49.540 --> 01:00:50.540]   of--
[01:00:50.540 --> 01:00:54.580]   Which by the way, Microsoft, according to Mary Jo Foley, who's one of the top Microsoft observers
[01:00:54.580 --> 01:01:00.120]   in the host of Windows Weekly, Microsoft's planning to kill Silverlight.
[01:01:00.120 --> 01:01:01.120]   Maybe that these--
[01:01:01.120 --> 01:01:02.720]   You know what?
[01:01:02.720 --> 01:01:03.720]   I think that's a good thing.
[01:01:03.720 --> 01:01:08.420]   These proprietary wrappers owned by Adobe or Microsoft should go away.
[01:01:08.420 --> 01:01:11.880]   The web should not be using proprietary technologies like that.
[01:01:11.880 --> 01:01:15.280]   I'd love to see WebM replace Flash.
[01:01:15.280 --> 01:01:16.280]   I don't know if it will.
[01:01:16.280 --> 01:01:20.280]   That's the Google supposedly open-sourced codec for video.
[01:01:20.280 --> 01:01:21.280]   John, go ahead.
[01:01:21.280 --> 01:01:22.280]   Yeah.
[01:01:22.280 --> 01:01:25.180]   It also seems a bit weird, though, in the fact that they do actually mention Apple.
[01:01:25.180 --> 01:01:26.480]   I mean, they never mentioned the--
[01:01:26.480 --> 01:01:27.480]   I know.
[01:01:27.480 --> 01:01:28.480]   I know.
[01:01:28.480 --> 01:01:29.480]   And in some respects--
[01:01:29.480 --> 01:01:30.480]   It's big things.
[01:01:30.480 --> 01:01:31.480]   I've seen that.
[01:01:31.480 --> 01:01:32.480]   You know, this is--
[01:01:32.480 --> 01:01:34.480]   I was going to buy a boat this year.
[01:01:34.480 --> 01:01:38.960]   But there are other things in the blog post that say, you know, it's difficult to develop
[01:01:38.960 --> 01:01:39.960]   for.
[01:01:39.960 --> 01:01:41.280]   It didn't perform as well as we thought it would.
[01:01:41.280 --> 01:01:44.980]   The amount of resource required for every new device that comes out that needs to support
[01:01:44.980 --> 01:01:49.360]   Flash, they might have worked, they need to do for tweaking and testing, et cetera.
[01:01:49.360 --> 01:01:53.120]   So to actually include Apple in the equation as well, it does seem to me a little bit of
[01:01:53.120 --> 01:01:57.360]   a-- well, actually, you know, it's Apple's fault really, and we can't really do it without
[01:01:57.360 --> 01:01:58.360]   them.
[01:01:58.360 --> 01:01:59.360]   Well, that's true, though.
[01:01:59.360 --> 01:02:01.360]   Is it not true?
[01:02:01.360 --> 01:02:02.360]   Yeah.
[01:02:02.360 --> 01:02:06.600]   I think the interesting thing now, though, is how are all these other non-IOS devices going
[01:02:06.600 --> 01:02:07.600]   to differentiate themselves?
[01:02:07.600 --> 01:02:09.360]   Because it's such a big selling point.
[01:02:09.360 --> 01:02:10.760]   It's these selling points.
[01:02:10.760 --> 01:02:11.760]   Yeah.
[01:02:11.760 --> 01:02:12.760]   What?
[01:02:12.760 --> 01:02:13.760]   Say now.
[01:02:13.760 --> 01:02:14.760]   Yeah.
[01:02:14.760 --> 01:02:15.760]   Android, will you rerun Flash?
[01:02:15.760 --> 01:02:16.760]   Whoops.
[01:02:16.760 --> 01:02:17.760]   Whoops.
[01:02:17.760 --> 01:02:22.780]   So-- all your real player content, you've got the best optimized environment ever.
[01:02:22.780 --> 01:02:31.760]   Well, I'm glad you mentioned real player, because really while people think, oh, Flash has always been here and it's going to be the future, and remember real.
[01:02:31.760 --> 01:02:41.060]   Everything, if you go look at old websites, dot RA was everywhere. That was the format for years, and you might have said the same thing about dot RA, and that went away too.
[01:02:41.060 --> 01:02:44.500]   This is normal, this is just kind of how things evolve.
[01:02:44.500 --> 01:02:52.500]   I'm a strong believer in open. I hate to see proprietary standards become the standard, because then one company controls it.
[01:02:52.500 --> 01:02:58.500]   And one company, as we can see, can kill it. And that's not what you want on the web, I don't think.
[01:02:58.500 --> 01:03:06.500]   Will there be a new MacBook Air in a couple of months that rather MacBook Pro that looks just like a MacBook Air, and would you run out to get it?
[01:03:06.500 --> 01:03:23.500]   The 9-5 Mac, quoting Digitimes, saying Apple's ordering components for a 15-inch MacBook Pro that would essentially be thin, no optical drive, a high-powered MacBook Air.
[01:03:23.500 --> 01:03:27.500]   I'd buy it. Of course, I'd buy everything. So I'm the wrong guy.
[01:03:27.500 --> 01:03:34.500]   It's interesting to think whether they would label it as a MacBook Pro or simply as a 15-inch Air.
[01:03:34.500 --> 01:03:44.500]   I'm not sure if the world is ready yet to say that it's called a Pro, but you don't get an optical drive and you're stuck with 256 gigs of storage which you can't expand.
[01:03:44.500 --> 01:03:55.500]   Right. Part of this requires Ivy Bridge, which is Intel's 22-nanometer processor, i7 processor that is...
[01:03:55.500 --> 01:04:00.500]   Quadcore? Not only Quadcore, but much more power efficient.
[01:04:00.500 --> 01:04:06.500]   And that's key because of course that's one of the things you lose when you get a thin design is battery.
[01:04:06.500 --> 01:04:14.500]   So in order to make that work, I think to get a 15-inch MacBook or a 17-inch MacBook Air, Ivy Bridge will have to happen.
[01:04:14.500 --> 01:04:16.500]   That's probably next spring.
[01:04:16.500 --> 01:04:22.500]   I think the Pro thing, it stands performance as an expandability.
[01:04:22.500 --> 01:04:26.500]   With the Ivy Bridge, these MacBooks...
[01:04:26.500 --> 01:04:29.500]   Thunderbolt. All you need is one port, right?
[01:04:29.500 --> 01:04:33.500]   Yeah, well, that's right. And by that time, hopefully fingers crossed.
[01:04:33.500 --> 01:04:39.500]   I know we've been waiting long enough for all these peripherals to magically appear, but within, I would think, four to five months,
[01:04:39.500 --> 01:04:49.500]   we probably will start seeing all these additional peripherals that are Thunderbolt enabled that would enable a Pro to use a MacBook Pro or a new MacBook Pro in the professional environment.
[01:04:49.500 --> 01:04:56.500]   And we know that what was it? 23, 24% of all Mac sales are now MacBook Airs. It is hugely successful.
[01:04:56.500 --> 01:05:02.500]   And so why not? I mean, at some point you're going to have to redo the MacBook Pros.
[01:05:02.500 --> 01:05:06.500]   Why not go in that direction with all of them?
[01:05:06.500 --> 01:05:10.500]   And then for people who need optical... What it's really saying is optical is gone.
[01:05:10.500 --> 01:05:13.500]   And I think that's not an unreasonable bet, right?
[01:05:13.500 --> 01:05:21.500]   I mean, some people still make the case. I like having an optical drive, but you can see with all the people who have bought the Airs that you get used to not having one.
[01:05:21.500 --> 01:05:22.500]   You do.
[01:05:22.500 --> 01:05:31.500]   Yeah, but the use case for so many of these machines is not your mobile travel road warrior machine, but this is the only Mac I have.
[01:05:31.500 --> 01:05:36.500]   This is my only computer. And it rarely leaves my actual physical desktop.
[01:05:36.500 --> 01:05:43.500]   So those two times a year when you actually want to rip a DVD or rip a CD, that actually becomes an important case.
[01:05:43.500 --> 01:05:47.500]   Yeah, but if you're Apple, that just sells more iMacs.
[01:05:47.500 --> 01:05:50.500]   Or $100 external drives, yeah.
[01:05:50.500 --> 01:05:51.500]   Yeah, or something.
[01:05:51.500 --> 01:05:53.500]   Yeah, maybe a dock.
[01:05:53.500 --> 01:05:57.500]   Yeah, I went on to Blog World in LA. I took my 11-inch MacBook Air.
[01:05:57.500 --> 01:06:03.500]   Fair enough, it's the top of the range on it. It's got the 256 gig hard disk in the SSD drive.
[01:06:03.500 --> 01:06:10.500]   And I actually put Final Cut Pro on and I put a ton of stuff I wanted to edit and I was sitting on the plane quite happily editing away my HD videos.
[01:06:10.500 --> 01:06:11.500]   That's awesome.
[01:06:11.500 --> 01:06:18.500]   I didn't render them until I came back, obviously, but it was perfect. It worked a treat. No problems whatsoever.
[01:06:18.500 --> 01:06:22.500]   Yeah, I'm a fan and I think that's a great form factor. And people obviously love it.
[01:06:22.500 --> 01:06:30.500]   In fact, they love it so much that Windows hardware manufacturers are trying to do these ultra books that are essentially clones of the MacBook Air.
[01:06:30.500 --> 01:06:32.500]   They're trying to get in on this, too.
[01:06:32.500 --> 01:06:35.500]   Yeah, it's really, really funny. I had the Asus first.
[01:06:35.500 --> 01:06:36.500]   Do this end?
[01:06:36.500 --> 01:06:38.500]   Yeah, the one that they released a couple of weeks ago.
[01:06:38.500 --> 01:06:39.500]   Yeah.
[01:06:39.500 --> 01:06:45.500]   And it's like, I have pictures of them side by side and it is like they pulled mold directly off of those, these things.
[01:06:45.500 --> 01:06:46.500]   It's the weird.
[01:06:46.500 --> 01:06:51.500]   I mean, on top of it, I realize that some of the placement of ports is dictated by the shape of the thing.
[01:06:51.500 --> 01:06:55.500]   When you've got this razor thin leading edge, the only place to put it is near the hinge.
[01:06:55.500 --> 01:07:01.500]   But when you say, "Okay, so I put the power connector here on the air and I put it the same place on the Asus."
[01:07:01.500 --> 01:07:05.500]   And here's where the monitor connector goes and here's where the monitor connector goes.
[01:07:05.500 --> 01:07:15.500]   But it's a tougher sell though on the PC side because they're competing when Apple decides to sell us an 11-inch MacBook Air for $999.
[01:07:15.500 --> 01:07:19.500]   We're excited because that's the cheapest MacBook you can possibly buy and it's so slim and it's so cool.
[01:07:19.500 --> 01:07:29.500]   However, on the PC side, they're competing against absolutely kick butt compact notebooks that cost $400 less than what they're selling an ultra book for.
[01:07:29.500 --> 01:07:35.500]   It doesn't have all the Intel specs for ultra books, but it still has an 8-hour battery in it.
[01:07:35.500 --> 01:07:40.500]   It still has like the three USB ports instead of just one and a half.
[01:07:40.500 --> 01:07:48.500]   So it's going to be interesting to see if the Windows world decides that it too wants to have those really nice ultra light machines.
[01:07:48.500 --> 01:07:52.500]   I hope though that Apple does continue to at least do a Mac Pro.
[01:07:52.500 --> 01:07:57.500]   And apparently there are some rumors again that they're considering dumping the Mac Pro.
[01:07:57.500 --> 01:08:02.500]   You've got to have some Pro stuff even if you don't have a Pro laptop.
[01:08:02.500 --> 01:08:04.500]   But what for?
[01:08:04.500 --> 01:08:06.500]   I mean the only two...
[01:08:06.500 --> 01:08:07.500]   For the Pro's.
[01:08:07.500 --> 01:08:09.500]   Well just for like multiple...
[01:08:09.500 --> 01:08:12.500]   I'll tell you right now we're buying another edit station.
[01:08:12.500 --> 01:08:14.500]   I don't see us really buying an iMac for that.
[01:08:14.500 --> 01:08:16.500]   I think we need a Pro.
[01:08:16.500 --> 01:08:18.500]   We've got a black magic card in it for capture.
[01:08:18.500 --> 01:08:20.500]   We've got to put a sand card in it.
[01:08:20.500 --> 01:08:26.500]   The only two things that people keep telling me about that they absolutely need for that kind of high-end stuff is they need a rack for that kind of high-end stuff is they need a rack for that kind of high-end stuff.
[01:08:26.500 --> 01:08:30.500]   They need a rack for internal drives that can have more than just a couple.
[01:08:30.500 --> 01:08:33.500]   And they need slots for these esoteric interfaces.
[01:08:33.500 --> 01:08:34.500]   Accelerators.
[01:08:34.500 --> 01:08:38.500]   Apple's response to that is that people are going to hear...
[01:08:38.500 --> 01:08:40.500]   Didn't you go to the nap convention a few months ago?
[01:08:40.500 --> 01:08:44.500]   That really great audio processing card is now going to be a Thunderbolt box.
[01:08:44.500 --> 01:08:47.500]   And you say that's really great ones that shipping and they say...
[01:08:47.500 --> 01:08:51.500]   Hey did you see the ultra matte black display?
[01:08:51.500 --> 01:08:53.500]   How black that display is on the iMac?
[01:08:53.500 --> 01:08:55.500]   I said yeah I asked the question about the...
[01:08:55.500 --> 01:08:57.500]   Hey look a duck.
[01:08:57.500 --> 01:08:59.500]   I guess okay let me think about this.
[01:08:59.500 --> 01:09:07.500]   So the two things we need are a black magic video card and we need a sand access so we need a fiber channel card.
[01:09:07.500 --> 01:09:14.500]   If I guess if we could do that through Thunderbolt it would be okay.
[01:09:14.500 --> 01:09:15.500]   I don't know.
[01:09:15.500 --> 01:09:16.500]   Putting...
[01:09:16.500 --> 01:09:17.500]   Yeah I guess.
[01:09:17.500 --> 01:09:24.500]   It kind of feels like if Apple were to stop making Mac Pros they're kind of declining the opportunity to make free money.
[01:09:24.500 --> 01:09:25.500]   Right.
[01:09:25.500 --> 01:09:36.500]   Because I can understand how they would never decide to reinvent the Mac Pro where this simple cheese grater tower design is pretty much the only design they're ever going to do.
[01:09:36.500 --> 01:09:44.500]   But if they simply say we're just going to keep doing processor upgrades at least for the next three or four years until anybody who had...
[01:09:44.500 --> 01:09:49.500]   Anybody who will ask ask us a question how can I do this on an iMac that I could...
[01:09:49.500 --> 01:09:51.500]   This thing that won't do the Mac Pro.
[01:09:51.500 --> 01:09:53.500]   It's going to take a few years for that to happen.
[01:09:53.500 --> 01:09:59.500]   I don't think we're going to see a really cool colossal redesign but I think we're still a while off from Apple never doing other Mac Pro.
[01:09:59.500 --> 01:10:00.500]   I think they're happy.
[01:10:00.500 --> 01:10:02.500]   Apple killed the X-Serv.
[01:10:02.500 --> 01:10:09.500]   I think they are very capable of refocusing their business and saying we're a consumer like Toronto's company.
[01:10:09.500 --> 01:10:16.500]   If you're a pro go elsewhere we don't care about you it's too small a market and then the pros are B.C.s right?
[01:10:16.500 --> 01:10:21.500]   Yeah the issue with the Mac Pro though the current Mac Pro is that it's overly engineered.
[01:10:21.500 --> 01:10:23.500]   I mean I've got two of these.
[01:10:23.500 --> 01:10:30.500]   It's just a solid piece of metal but the reason it is this design is because you've got the four internal drive bays.
[01:10:30.500 --> 01:10:35.500]   You've got the option to upgrade to gigabytes and gigabytes of RAM.
[01:10:35.500 --> 01:10:38.500]   You've got the option to have four additional card slots in.
[01:10:38.500 --> 01:10:41.500]   So the ventilation has to be there the fans have to be there.
[01:10:41.500 --> 01:10:45.500]   Everything has to be built so that it can support all this expansion.
[01:10:45.500 --> 01:10:51.500]   The power supply has to be configured so that it could take a fully loaded Mac Pro.
[01:10:51.500 --> 01:10:53.500]   It's all weighted, it's all expense.
[01:10:53.500 --> 01:11:00.500]   Once you start taking away the requirement to have these internal drives once you have a five drive thunderbolt array external to your machine.
[01:11:00.500 --> 01:11:06.500]   Once you have a black magic card that's connectable by a thunderbolt that you can do capture from external to your machine
[01:11:06.500 --> 01:11:11.500]   you can literally bring the machine down to the size of a Mac Mini or a one U-Rag.
[01:11:11.500 --> 01:11:15.500]   So reinvent the X-Serve but based on thunderbolt technology.
[01:11:15.500 --> 01:11:17.500]   Yeah I guess you can.
[01:11:17.500 --> 01:11:23.500]   And I guess the really the only thing we're saying, the only question is does Apple care at all about this market?
[01:11:23.500 --> 01:11:26.500]   Because they certainly can support it somehow.
[01:11:26.500 --> 01:11:36.500]   Or is it that literally Apple doesn't care about the market because it's too small and you know the final cut is now a consumer product.
[01:11:36.500 --> 01:11:38.500]   And we're just dinosaurs.
[01:11:38.500 --> 01:11:44.500]   Seems like what Andy was saying, if they're going to continue to sell Mac Pros why not keep offering them.
[01:11:44.500 --> 01:11:53.500]   Maybe figure out how many you can cut out of the manufacturing line and make sure that you don't have a surplus.
[01:11:53.500 --> 01:11:57.500]   But otherwise yeah for the next five years I don't see them cutting it out.
[01:11:57.500 --> 01:12:07.500]   You could also manipulate I think these high end users into buying iMacs and MacBook Pros as an act of fake rebellion.
[01:12:07.500 --> 01:12:13.500]   But if Apple simply continues to drag its feet on delivering the best processors into the Mac Pro line,
[01:12:13.500 --> 01:12:18.500]   these people can say, "Oh yeah well Apple I'm going to tell I've had it with waiting for the new Mac Pro.
[01:12:18.500 --> 01:12:21.500]   I'll teach you a lesson. I'm going to buy myself a top of the line iMac."
[01:12:21.500 --> 01:12:25.500]   You just lost your back forecast by the way.
[01:12:25.500 --> 01:12:34.500]   I haven't been playing Skyrim Elder Scrolls V which is a Windows game on my high end iMac and it plays beautifully running Windows and bootcamp.
[01:12:34.500 --> 01:12:35.500]   It's just gorgeous.
[01:12:35.500 --> 01:12:37.500]   So there you go.
[01:12:37.500 --> 01:12:39.500]   Maybe that's the solution just buy an iMac.
[01:12:39.500 --> 01:12:42.500]   We're going to do a couple of quick stories and then get to our picks.
[01:12:42.500 --> 01:12:54.500]   We want to mention though according to who the adoption rate of OS 10 Lion has seen a drastic slowdown.
[01:12:54.500 --> 01:13:03.500]   This is a study and I don't know how accurate from Chitakah that only 16% of all Macs are running Lion
[01:13:03.500 --> 01:13:05.500]   and sales have slowed to a cross.
[01:13:05.500 --> 01:13:09.500]   No leopard is on 56% of all Macs.
[01:13:09.500 --> 01:13:14.500]   Is there a little bit of a bounce back, a blow back against Lion?
[01:13:14.500 --> 01:13:17.500]   Are people deciding that they don't like the iOSification?
[01:13:17.500 --> 01:13:20.500]   Are they a little bit worried about losing things like quicken?
[01:13:20.500 --> 01:13:24.500]   Is Lion perhaps not doing as well as it should?
[01:13:24.500 --> 01:13:27.500]   What do you think, Don?
[01:13:27.500 --> 01:13:32.500]   It's difficult to say because I can't see it being that low to be honest.
[01:13:32.500 --> 01:13:35.500]   It just seems awfully low, 16% percent.
[01:13:35.500 --> 01:13:44.500]   Yeah, I mean the only group tend to do some metrics on adoption because they can tell from the people who use their software they do sort of some metrics.
[01:13:44.500 --> 01:13:52.500]   Although they haven't refreshed it recently, they did show quite a steep curve for the adoption in the early couple of weeks for Lion.
[01:13:52.500 --> 01:13:54.500]   Now whether or not I have to tailed off or not we don't know.
[01:13:54.500 --> 01:14:00.500]   That's what this study says is that it was very strong initially but the sales have slowed to a crawl.
[01:14:00.500 --> 01:14:02.500]   Yeah, I don't know.
[01:14:02.500 --> 01:14:13.500]   Some people are upset about some of the changes in Lion but I think people from Screencast's Lion point of view, I've seen lots of people who are adopting Lion.
[01:14:13.500 --> 01:14:14.500]   I want Lion.
[01:14:14.500 --> 01:14:15.500]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:14:15.500 --> 01:14:17.500]   And I sort of need to keep up with that.
[01:14:17.500 --> 01:14:25.500]   I think people saying no, we're still on Snow Leopard, etc.
[01:14:25.500 --> 01:14:30.500]   But I'm not really sure what the issue is if there is an issue that's begin with.
[01:14:30.500 --> 01:14:35.500]   I think one of the problems is that a lot of users can't just upgrade to Lion.
[01:14:35.500 --> 01:14:38.500]   They have to first upgrade to Snow Leopard.
[01:14:38.500 --> 01:14:46.500]   So that's another outlay of cash and another intermediate step is really surprising how many people are still using 10.5 and even 10.4.
[01:14:46.500 --> 01:14:47.500]   It might be their Vista.
[01:14:47.500 --> 01:14:51.500]   It took me forever to upgrade to Lion and it wasn't because I wasn't interested.
[01:14:51.500 --> 01:14:55.500]   It was sort of on my to-do list but Snow Leopard worked fine.
[01:14:55.500 --> 01:14:58.500]   A couple of my friends said, "Oh, it's going to be so weird.
[01:14:58.500 --> 01:15:02.500]   Could you scroll in the opposite direction as if you were on an iOS night?"
[01:15:02.500 --> 01:15:03.500]   It may just be that.
[01:15:03.500 --> 01:15:07.500]   And I thought, "I'm not really in the mood to do that differently today."
[01:15:07.500 --> 01:15:11.500]   And so it took me forever to just launch the Mac App Store and download Lion.
[01:15:11.500 --> 01:15:14.500]   Once I did, it was seamless and I'm totally used to it.
[01:15:14.500 --> 01:15:16.500]   It took me about two days to do it.
[01:15:16.500 --> 01:15:18.500]   But I'd felt no need.
[01:15:18.500 --> 01:15:20.500]   The good thing though is the versions.
[01:15:20.500 --> 01:15:23.500]   There are some features in Lion which I find now in people.
[01:15:23.500 --> 01:15:27.500]   The fact that we've got the versioning which is part of the operating system,
[01:15:27.500 --> 01:15:29.500]   providing the app has been lionized.
[01:15:29.500 --> 01:15:32.500]   The fact that you can actually go back and see past versions of documents.
[01:15:32.500 --> 01:15:33.500]   That just works seamlessly.
[01:15:33.500 --> 01:15:37.500]   I know some people are a little bit upset about the removal of File Save As.
[01:15:37.500 --> 01:15:39.500]   But again, there are ways around that.
[01:15:39.500 --> 01:15:41.500]   It's just a new way of working.
[01:15:41.500 --> 01:15:44.500]   But the benefits that it gives you, I think, do pay back.
[01:15:44.500 --> 01:15:46.500]   Can I do some gratuitous self-promotionally?
[01:15:46.500 --> 01:15:47.500]   Please.
[01:15:47.500 --> 01:15:52.500]   Well, the funny thing is, no, I actually, obviously with Screencast Online,
[01:15:52.500 --> 01:15:57.500]   I did a ton of lion content because I sort of wanted to, I always try to guide my sort of
[01:15:57.500 --> 01:16:01.500]   members through the installation process and then sort of getting the best out of Lion.
[01:16:01.500 --> 01:16:06.500]   Because I think Apple haven't done a very good job about demonstrating what is actually in Lion
[01:16:06.500 --> 01:16:08.500]   and the benefits that it brings.
[01:16:08.500 --> 01:16:15.500]   So I've actually just, not just about three weeks ago, I launched a Mac App Store app all about Lion.
[01:16:15.500 --> 01:16:19.500]   So as well as my weekly show now, I've launched into App Development
[01:16:19.500 --> 01:16:21.500]   with a friend of mine, a guy called Simon Wolf.
[01:16:21.500 --> 01:16:27.500]   And we've got this application now on the Mac App Store, which is about five episodes
[01:16:27.500 --> 01:16:31.500]   that takes you through all the features in line and how to get the most out of it.
[01:16:31.500 --> 01:16:34.500]   But the unique thing is it's actually got subtitles on as well.
[01:16:34.500 --> 01:16:41.500]   It's got English subtitles, French, Spanish, Chinese, and Brazilian Portuguese as well.
[01:16:41.500 --> 01:16:44.500]   So if people, well, mind you, if people want, I was going to say, if people want to check out
[01:16:44.500 --> 01:16:47.500]   what Lion's all about, they can actually go and download the app.
[01:16:47.500 --> 01:16:51.500]   But the app is just for Lion only, which one you can do.
[01:16:51.500 --> 01:16:53.500]   It wasn't meant as a sales thing.
[01:16:53.500 --> 01:16:57.500]   It was meant really, you know, if people have upgraded to Lion, if you have, I mean,
[01:16:57.500 --> 01:17:01.500]   I can, I think I can arrange a non-line version somewhere, but the current version on the Mac App Store
[01:17:01.500 --> 01:17:05.500]   is a Lion only version. But if you have upgraded to Lion, it sort of takes you through.
[01:17:05.500 --> 01:17:08.500]   It's about two and a half hours long, takes you through, you know, all the features
[01:17:08.500 --> 01:17:10.500]   and explains all the benefits to it.
[01:17:10.500 --> 01:17:12.500]   Interesting. Lion only.
[01:17:12.500 --> 01:17:15.500]   SEO, "Tutor for Lion." The best mention the name, hadn't I?
[01:17:15.500 --> 01:17:18.500]   Oh, yeah, because I was searching for all about Lion. I didn't find it.
[01:17:18.500 --> 01:17:21.500]   SEO, "Tutor for Lion."
[01:17:21.500 --> 01:17:25.500]   It's said about 95 star reviews in the past three weeks.
[01:17:25.500 --> 01:17:27.500]   Very nicely. It's great.
[01:17:27.500 --> 01:17:29.500]   SEO, of course, is screencasts online.
[01:17:29.500 --> 01:17:31.500]   Screencasts online, "Tutor for Lion."
[01:17:31.500 --> 01:17:35.500]   All one word, SEO, "Tutor." Oh, cool. All right. I see it right here.
[01:17:35.500 --> 01:17:36.500]   Mm-hmm.
[01:17:36.500 --> 01:17:38.500]   Five dollars and a half cents. Thank you for doing that. That's great.
[01:17:38.500 --> 01:17:39.500]   No problem.
[01:17:39.500 --> 01:17:44.500]   Yeah. All right. 501, real quickly. And I got, we got, we got to move along here.
[01:17:44.500 --> 01:17:47.500]   You haven't upgraded your iPad to 501 yet?
[01:17:47.500 --> 01:17:48.500]   I have not.
[01:17:48.500 --> 01:17:52.500]   And I upgraded everything, and I'm starting to think maybe I shouldn't have.
[01:17:52.500 --> 01:17:53.500]   So what's wrong?
[01:17:53.500 --> 01:17:57.500]   Well, my iPhone, I have to reboot it a lot. Andy, have you had any issues? 501?
[01:17:57.500 --> 01:18:00.500]   Not at all. My phone works fine.
[01:18:00.500 --> 01:18:05.500]   I wasn't suffering any major battery issues, but now I'm suffering even less fewer major battery issues.
[01:18:05.500 --> 01:18:07.500]   So you did see an improvement in battery fruit for it?
[01:18:07.500 --> 01:18:11.500]   I saw a bit of improvement. I wasn't having sort of crippling issues.
[01:18:11.500 --> 01:18:15.500]   It's a big, my actual personal iPad is the iPad 1.
[01:18:15.500 --> 01:18:20.500]   So that was a definite must have upgrade because that's the only way you can get those four-fingered swipes
[01:18:20.500 --> 01:18:23.500]   to go in and out of the swap between apps.
[01:18:23.500 --> 01:18:25.500]   For some reason, I don't know why they didn't put into 5.0,
[01:18:25.500 --> 01:18:28.500]   but now it's available to me in 5.01.
[01:18:28.500 --> 01:18:30.500]   So I've had nothing but good news with it.
[01:18:30.500 --> 01:18:32.500]   All right. Maybe it's just me.
[01:18:32.500 --> 01:18:34.500]   No, it's me as well.
[01:18:34.500 --> 01:18:35.500]   Oh, you too.
[01:18:35.500 --> 01:18:40.500]   Yeah, well, I was one of the people who suffered from the battery issues from when the 4S came out.
[01:18:40.500 --> 01:18:43.500]   It was terrible. It was awful.
[01:18:43.500 --> 01:18:47.500]   It just wouldn't keep a charge for the best part of three-quarters of the day.
[01:18:47.500 --> 01:18:51.500]   So the only way I got around that was to do a DFU restore.
[01:18:51.500 --> 01:18:54.500]   You know, one of these hard restores, the DFU restore?
[01:18:54.500 --> 01:18:57.500]   And then restore from an iCloud backup that I've made.
[01:18:57.500 --> 01:19:00.500]   And that cured it. It went perfect. The battery life went perfectly.
[01:19:00.500 --> 01:19:05.500]   Then I installed 5.0.1 and it went back to as it was before.
[01:19:05.500 --> 01:19:07.500]   So the battery life just fell off.
[01:19:07.500 --> 01:19:13.500]   So last night I did another DFU restore and restored from my iCloud backup and it's back to...
[01:19:13.500 --> 01:19:15.500]   ...nice. It's good.
[01:19:15.500 --> 01:19:16.500]   So mixed results.
[01:19:16.500 --> 01:19:17.500]   Mixed results.
[01:19:17.500 --> 01:19:19.500]   Really strange. Really strange.
[01:19:19.500 --> 01:19:20.500]   Yeah.
[01:19:20.500 --> 01:19:23.500]   You know, I've had unresponsiveness, weird errors.
[01:19:23.500 --> 01:19:25.500]   Maybe there's something wrong with the phone. It could be...
[01:19:25.500 --> 01:19:27.500]   Yeah, I'm not ahead of many people having those sort of issues.
[01:19:27.500 --> 01:19:28.500]   I've used 4S.
[01:19:28.500 --> 01:19:31.500]   Yeah. I don't want to jump to any conclusions because it could just be me.
[01:19:31.500 --> 01:19:35.500]   And the battery issues that everyone's having are so inconsistent anyway.
[01:19:35.500 --> 01:19:36.500]   I mean...
[01:19:36.500 --> 01:19:37.500]   It's hard to even say one of these.
[01:19:37.500 --> 01:19:42.500]   So soon as I turned off "Find My Friends" and it was better or I turned off "Location Services",
[01:19:42.500 --> 01:19:48.500]   I have all of that stuff turned on because I like to use it and I'm not having issues.
[01:19:48.500 --> 01:19:53.500]   Yeah. This is the problem. You don't want to turn off all these functionality that have built into the phone to cure your back issues.
[01:19:53.500 --> 01:19:56.500]   It should... It's designed to work with all the functions turned on.
[01:19:56.500 --> 01:20:00.500]   So switching all these random things off to cure it. That's not the way to go.
[01:20:00.500 --> 01:20:01.500]   Yeah. That's not a solution.
[01:20:01.500 --> 01:20:02.500]   That's right.
[01:20:02.500 --> 01:20:08.500]   Any other quick stories before we get to our tips and picks?
[01:20:08.500 --> 01:20:10.500]   We've still got a lot to go. There's so much to talk about.
[01:20:10.500 --> 01:20:13.500]   That movie, Steve Jobs, The Lost Interview.
[01:20:13.500 --> 01:20:16.500]   There's a trailer online now. You could check that out.
[01:20:16.500 --> 01:20:22.500]   Apparently, OS X Lions, All My Files icon has. Here's to the crazy ones hidden in it.
[01:20:22.500 --> 01:20:26.500]   Yeah. That's also true. The text that it downloaded.
[01:20:26.500 --> 01:20:27.500]   Text that it's had that.
[01:20:27.500 --> 01:20:28.500]   Text that it's had that.
[01:20:28.500 --> 01:20:30.500]   That's been there for some time.
[01:20:30.500 --> 01:20:34.500]   Let's see.
[01:20:34.500 --> 01:20:39.500]   I think everything else is a little softer.
[01:20:39.500 --> 01:20:43.500]   Let's take a little break. When we come back, we've got an iOS tip, a Lion tip,
[01:20:43.500 --> 01:20:48.500]   and we've got our picks of the week as well. Andy and Ococero Lane and Don McAllister.
[01:20:48.500 --> 01:20:50.500]   I'm Leo LaPorte. You're watching MacBreak Weekly.
[01:20:50.500 --> 01:20:53.500]   Brought to you today by our friends. It's Smile Software.
[01:20:53.500 --> 01:20:55.500]   I'm a big fan of Smile Software.
[01:20:55.500 --> 01:20:56.500]   Everybody loves Smile Software.
[01:20:56.500 --> 01:20:59.500]   G. McDonald's made friends of everybody in the Mac community.
[01:20:59.500 --> 01:21:04.500]   They make such great software, and they're such great players in the Mac community.
[01:21:04.500 --> 01:21:08.500]   They put on conferences and events. We'll see them, I'm sure, at the new iWorld,
[01:21:08.500 --> 01:21:10.500]   which is the old Macworld iWorld Expo.
[01:21:10.500 --> 01:21:15.500]   In fact, I think we're going to do our meetup again. I'm sure Gene and everybody will be there.
[01:21:15.500 --> 01:21:20.500]   Now, by the way, I've been using this a lot. I've been doing a lot of forms lately.
[01:21:20.500 --> 01:21:25.500]   PDF Pen and PDF Pen Pro. You can get a free demo if you go to
[01:21:25.500 --> 01:21:28.500]   pdfsmilesophore.com/macbreak.
[01:21:28.500 --> 01:21:32.500]   This is the best way to open PDFs. Edit them.
[01:21:32.500 --> 01:21:37.500]   Add text, images, signatures, make corrections, fill out forms.
[01:21:37.500 --> 01:21:40.500]   You can merge delete and reorder pages. You can redact.
[01:21:40.500 --> 01:21:45.500]   You can do so much with PDF Pen and PDF Pen Pro.
[01:21:45.500 --> 01:21:49.500]   If you work with PDFs, if you have to fill out forms, this is the way to do it.
[01:21:49.500 --> 01:21:54.500]   Tax time is coming. This will be the way to do your taxes with those IRS PDF forms.
[01:21:54.500 --> 01:22:00.500]   I use it to sign forms all the time. I keep the library of my signatures, my family signatures,
[01:22:00.500 --> 01:22:03.500]   initials, and so forth. And I just, boom, it's like a rubber stamp.
[01:22:03.500 --> 01:22:11.500]   You just stamp it and it's done. PDF Pen is normally $59.95, but you can get it for free for 30 days.
[01:22:11.500 --> 01:22:14.500]   Smile Software.com/macbreak.
[01:22:14.500 --> 01:22:21.500]   If you look at the difference between PDF Pen and PDF Pen Pro, you can see the few extra features
[01:22:21.500 --> 01:22:27.500]   like cross-platform PDF forms, advanced form features like pop-up menus and buttons are in the Pro version.
[01:22:27.500 --> 01:22:32.500]   So you can pick the version that you need, but it is a really fantastic product.
[01:22:32.500 --> 01:22:35.500]   And they do such a nice job with it. Try it free right now.
[01:22:35.500 --> 01:22:41.500]   Go to smilesoftware.com/macbreak. They're also on Facebook if you want to like them.
[01:22:41.500 --> 01:22:46.500]   Who doesn't like them? Facebook.com/smilesoftware.
[01:22:46.500 --> 01:22:52.500]   In fact, if we go there, I think they have pictures from their visit to our studios on their Facebook page.
[01:22:52.500 --> 01:22:53.500]   On their Facebook page?
[01:22:53.500 --> 01:22:56.500]   Yeah. Facebook.com/smilesoftware.
[01:22:56.500 --> 01:23:01.500]   They have some great pictures that we can take a look at.
[01:23:01.500 --> 01:23:05.500]   You can make corrections on PDFs too.
[01:23:05.500 --> 01:23:09.500]   By the way, they have an OCR. There you go. See, there's their brick.
[01:23:09.500 --> 01:23:13.500]   I never mentioned this, but they have built-in OCR. They have a very good OCR engine.
[01:23:13.500 --> 01:23:20.500]   So when you scan stuff or you have an existing PDF, you can turn it into editable text, which is fantastic, or searchable text.
[01:23:20.500 --> 01:23:22.500]   Fantastic.
[01:23:22.500 --> 01:23:26.500]   Go paperless with PDF Pen and PDF Pen Pro.
[01:23:26.500 --> 01:23:33.500]   The affordable PDF toolkits everybody should have.
[01:23:33.500 --> 01:23:36.500]   It's really fantastic.
[01:23:36.500 --> 01:23:43.500]   smilesoftware.com/pmacbreak.
[01:23:43.500 --> 01:23:47.500]   All right. Let's move on. It's time for our tips of the week.
[01:23:47.500 --> 01:23:50.500]   Now, we don't have Alex here, but I think that we-
[01:23:50.500 --> 01:23:53.500]   Well, I was going to do an iOS type of Alex's absence.
[01:23:53.500 --> 01:23:56.500]   I'm the queen of iPad today.
[01:23:56.500 --> 01:23:58.500]   Well, I'm glad it's not you.
[01:23:58.500 --> 01:24:01.500]   I am the queen of iPad today.
[01:24:01.500 --> 01:24:03.500]   Sarah, do you have a tip?
[01:24:03.500 --> 01:24:10.500]   I do. So I don't actually hang out on Macbreak weekly that often, so I'm not sure if this is something that Alex has covered in the past before.
[01:24:10.500 --> 01:24:22.500]   But it's actually something that I happen to have just figured out recently, and that's when I have a bunch of either Gmail accounts or Google Apps accounts that I access through Apple Mail in iOS.
[01:24:22.500 --> 01:24:29.500]   That's the way that I prefer to manage my email rather than going through Google in Safari.
[01:24:29.500 --> 01:24:36.500]   But one of the things that I like to do, especially in particular threads, is just delete email instead of archive. They're archived by default.
[01:24:36.500 --> 01:24:39.500]   So, for example- Yeah, I don't like that to archive button.
[01:24:39.500 --> 01:24:41.500]   I want to get rid of this spam and stuff like that.
[01:24:41.500 --> 01:24:45.500]   Yeah, so it's like we're used to, you know, if you swipe left, you get this nice archive button.
[01:24:45.500 --> 01:24:47.500]   And that's fine. You press archive, and then it goes into your archive.
[01:24:47.500 --> 01:24:51.500]   But a lot of this, I mean, this is a thread about, you know, the problems with our website, and it's like,
[01:24:51.500 --> 01:24:56.500]   "I just want that stuff to go away. I'll deal with archiving when I'm at my computer later."
[01:24:56.500 --> 01:25:03.500]   If you just go into Settings, and then in your Mail, Contacts, Calendar's area, you choose the, I have a few email accounts,
[01:25:03.500 --> 01:25:06.500]   but I choose Sarah to a .tv because that's the one that I'm talking about.
[01:25:06.500 --> 01:25:10.500]   All you do is go ahead and instead of archive messages on, switch it to Off.
[01:25:10.500 --> 01:25:11.500]   Oh.
[01:25:11.500 --> 01:25:12.500]   Yeah. And then you say Done.
[01:25:12.500 --> 01:25:13.500]   And it will say Delete now on that?
[01:25:13.500 --> 01:25:15.500]   Yeah, so when you go back to the Mail- That's cool.
[01:25:15.500 --> 01:25:16.500]   Yeah.
[01:25:16.500 --> 01:25:17.500]   That's not intuitive though.
[01:25:17.500 --> 01:25:18.500]   Delete.
[01:25:18.500 --> 01:25:19.500]   Love that.
[01:25:19.500 --> 01:25:21.180]   with a little, you might not be able to read it,
[01:25:21.180 --> 01:25:22.640]   but I assure you it says delete.
[01:25:22.640 --> 01:25:24.640]   - To the fault is archived, so it's nice to have delete.
[01:25:24.640 --> 01:25:27.280]   - So, it's just something that you might know about it
[01:25:27.280 --> 01:25:29.800]   but if you didn't it's a nice little handy tip to have.
[01:25:29.800 --> 01:25:31.040]   - Nice little tip. - Yeah.
[01:25:31.040 --> 01:25:32.440]   - Thank you. - You're welcome.
[01:25:32.440 --> 01:25:35.000]   - Appreciate that, Andy you have an aliah...
[01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:39.580]   - Mac OS tip for us.
[01:25:39.580 --> 01:25:42.900]   - Exactly, in the Finder when you hit command and end
[01:25:42.900 --> 01:25:44.560]   you get a brand new Finder window
[01:25:44.560 --> 01:25:46.700]   and it normally takes you to all my files.
[01:25:46.700 --> 01:25:51.700]   That big, everything you own in one big squishy pile list box.
[01:25:51.700 --> 01:25:53.740]   If you go into Finder Preferences,
[01:25:53.740 --> 01:25:54.740]   not Preferences for System,
[01:25:54.740 --> 01:25:58.220]   but the actual Finder Preferences underneath the file menu,
[01:25:58.220 --> 01:26:00.480]   you will find that there's actually a preference
[01:26:00.480 --> 01:26:02.860]   to define what the default content
[01:26:02.860 --> 01:26:04.540]   of a new window should be.
[01:26:04.540 --> 01:26:06.620]   So, if you wanted to be your home folder,
[01:26:06.620 --> 01:26:08.340]   if you wanted to be your pictures folder
[01:26:08.340 --> 01:26:11.580]   or any other arbitrary folder like your Dropbox folder,
[01:26:11.580 --> 01:26:12.540]   you just set it right there.
[01:26:12.540 --> 01:26:14.220]   So, every time you hit command and you will be taken
[01:26:14.220 --> 01:26:17.620]   to just an empty window, but exactly the area
[01:26:17.620 --> 01:26:19.540]   that you think that every single new window
[01:26:19.540 --> 01:26:21.300]   should be focused on. - That nice.
[01:26:21.300 --> 01:26:23.220]   Hey, I figured out why you couldn't see my screen.
[01:26:23.220 --> 01:26:24.900]   It wasn't mirrored, you should be able to see it now.
[01:26:24.900 --> 01:26:26.420]   - Okay. - Can you see?
[01:26:26.420 --> 01:26:27.260]   - Is this where are we?
[01:26:27.260 --> 01:26:29.060]   No. - That's damn!
[01:26:29.060 --> 01:26:31.820]   - I actually did go to it right now and it's still...
[01:26:31.820 --> 01:26:33.300]   - Still blue. - Still black now.
[01:26:33.300 --> 01:26:34.780]   - No, it's black. - Now I didn't have any picture.
[01:26:34.780 --> 01:26:36.140]   - Well, making some progress.
[01:26:36.140 --> 01:26:37.580]   (laughing)
[01:26:37.580 --> 01:26:39.420]   Now it's black. - It was blue.
[01:26:39.420 --> 01:26:42.140]   - Well, no, actually you used to have some color in it,
[01:26:42.140 --> 01:26:43.380]   now it has no color in it. - Great color.
[01:26:43.380 --> 01:26:45.780]   Can you see it now? - Now it's just one big pixel.
[01:26:45.780 --> 01:26:46.620]   - Nothing. - I'm trying.
[01:26:46.620 --> 01:26:48.140]   I'm so sorry. - Don't worry about it.
[01:26:48.140 --> 01:26:49.500]   I was just gonna show what Andy's did.
[01:26:49.500 --> 01:26:50.940]   - I know, I wanted... - It's very nice.
[01:26:50.940 --> 01:26:53.780]   In the Finder Preferences, new Finder Windows Show,
[01:26:53.780 --> 01:26:55.420]   and you can make it any folder.
[01:26:55.420 --> 01:26:56.980]   Is that the tip, Andy?
[01:26:56.980 --> 01:26:58.460]   - That is the tip. - That is the tip.
[01:26:58.460 --> 01:26:59.860]   You can figure that out, I don't think that's...
[01:26:59.860 --> 01:27:01.860]   - I clearly did an excellent job describing the feature.
[01:27:01.860 --> 01:27:05.060]   - You did, because I immediately grocked it, as the kids say.
[01:27:05.060 --> 01:27:06.940]   - I am an education professional.
[01:27:06.940 --> 01:27:09.100]   - All right, time for our picks of the week.
[01:27:09.100 --> 01:27:11.180]   Let's start with Mr. Don McAllister.
[01:27:12.140 --> 01:27:15.100]   Okay, this is actually this sort of
[01:27:15.100 --> 01:27:16.660]   harks back to what we were talking about before,
[01:27:16.660 --> 01:27:18.700]   and HTML, 5, and video.
[01:27:18.700 --> 01:27:22.900]   When I was creating the support pages for the Mac Store app,
[01:27:22.900 --> 01:27:26.180]   I wanted to put a small video in the web page,
[01:27:26.180 --> 01:27:28.340]   and normally on the screencast online,
[01:27:28.340 --> 01:27:30.700]   I normally sort of have Apple users,
[01:27:30.700 --> 01:27:33.500]   so just empty profiles are normally fine for me.
[01:27:33.500 --> 01:27:35.500]   But we discovered that people using Chrome
[01:27:35.500 --> 01:27:37.780]   and people using different browsers
[01:27:37.780 --> 01:27:39.700]   couldn't actually access the video.
[01:27:39.700 --> 01:27:43.460]   So what I had to do was create three different types of video,
[01:27:43.460 --> 01:27:46.180]   and embed them into the HTML5 tag.
[01:27:46.180 --> 01:27:47.620]   But how to create those videos?
[01:27:47.620 --> 01:27:50.340]   There's an application called MiroConverter,
[01:27:50.340 --> 01:27:54.060]   or MiroVideoConverter, which is a free app on the Mac App Store,
[01:27:54.060 --> 01:27:56.460]   and basically it'll take any file
[01:27:56.460 --> 01:27:59.140]   and convert it into lots of other different types of files.
[01:27:59.140 --> 01:28:01.780]   And the one I needed to do was Ogg Theora,
[01:28:01.780 --> 01:28:04.780]   which I think was for Chrome or for Firefox,
[01:28:04.780 --> 01:28:06.620]   and then also WebM as well,
[01:28:06.620 --> 01:28:10.900]   which I think was Opera, and needed that particular type of file.
[01:28:10.900 --> 01:28:14.260]   So this is a very simple video conversion utility.
[01:28:14.260 --> 01:28:16.100]   As I say, you can take a single file,
[01:28:16.100 --> 01:28:18.780]   it will export it into these standard formats now
[01:28:18.780 --> 01:28:22.460]   so that you can embed them in your HTML5 tags,
[01:28:22.460 --> 01:28:25.060]   and then no matter which browser the people are actually using,
[01:28:25.060 --> 01:28:26.620]   they will always see the video.
[01:28:26.620 --> 01:28:29.740]   And that page is over at screencastonline.com/mas,
[01:28:29.740 --> 01:28:31.100]   you can actually see it in action over there,
[01:28:31.100 --> 01:28:32.980]   that's the encoded video.
[01:28:32.980 --> 01:28:40.260]   And it's on theora, WebM, and also for different devices as well.
[01:28:40.260 --> 01:28:41.540]   Yeah, very handy.
[01:28:41.540 --> 01:28:43.500]   So this kind of takes a place of,
[01:28:43.500 --> 01:28:47.100]   what was that old, that program video, there was a video hub?
[01:28:47.100 --> 01:28:49.980]   Video hub? Yeah, visual hub.
[01:28:49.980 --> 01:28:50.820]   Visual hub, yeah.
[01:28:50.820 --> 01:28:53.220]   I mean, I still use handbrake for my standard encoding,
[01:28:53.220 --> 01:28:56.540]   but this is great just for these weird and wacky different formats
[01:28:56.540 --> 01:28:57.820]   that you need for HTML5.
[01:28:57.820 --> 01:29:00.300]   I mean, I think it's probably very comparable to visual hub.
[01:29:00.300 --> 01:29:02.220]   That's cool.
[01:29:02.220 --> 01:29:06.420]   Let's, I'll tell you what, because I think we should let,
[01:29:06.420 --> 01:29:09.580]   I think we should, Sarah Lane, do you have a pic?
[01:29:09.580 --> 01:29:11.580]   Are you nervous? I'm very nervous now.
[01:29:11.580 --> 01:29:12.900]   I don't know many, many women.
[01:29:12.900 --> 01:29:15.540]   And so it's for me. I don't really count.
[01:29:15.540 --> 01:29:17.340]   It's very funny. Yeah, I have a tip,
[01:29:17.340 --> 01:29:22.940]   and this is actually something that you can access in Safari.
[01:29:22.940 --> 01:29:26.180]   I'll be able to access it really from any browser.
[01:29:26.180 --> 01:29:28.740]   And it used to be more of an iOS kind of a fun thing,
[01:29:28.740 --> 01:29:29.500]   and that's four square.
[01:29:29.500 --> 01:29:34.980]   A four square has a whole new new four square desktop type
[01:29:34.980 --> 01:29:38.540]   of experience. Oh, they just sounded on this morning.
[01:29:38.540 --> 01:29:40.900]   And at first, I thought, well, I never access four square
[01:29:40.900 --> 01:29:43.620]   from my look at how cute or why do I even need this?
[01:29:43.620 --> 01:29:46.060]   And I realized that I didn't because there was really nothing
[01:29:46.060 --> 01:29:46.900]   there. Right.
[01:29:46.900 --> 01:29:48.700]   Four square was sort of, it had no sort of--
[01:29:48.700 --> 01:29:49.820]   It was a portable thing, yeah.
[01:29:49.820 --> 01:29:53.460]   Yeah, no browser experience could be seen.
[01:29:53.460 --> 01:29:56.500]   Now what you've got is, so I've logged in,
[01:29:56.500 --> 01:29:58.980]   and you've got, you know, this is where I've checked in last,
[01:29:58.980 --> 01:30:00.340]   which is Twit Brick House Studios.
[01:30:00.340 --> 01:30:03.380]   And my friends who are all sorts of other places,
[01:30:03.380 --> 01:30:05.380]   I also have people that I may know,
[01:30:05.380 --> 01:30:08.140]   and it depends on who of my friends are connected to them.
[01:30:08.140 --> 01:30:10.700]   So in many cases, it's people that I do want to connect to.
[01:30:10.700 --> 01:30:13.580]   Daniel Berk. I have no idea why I'm not his four square friends,
[01:30:13.580 --> 01:30:16.580]   so I can go ahead and just easily ask to Adam as a friend.
[01:30:16.580 --> 01:30:19.020]   Lists from my friends, and that's something that--
[01:30:19.020 --> 01:30:21.020]   I love the new list. I do too.
[01:30:21.020 --> 01:30:23.140]   I get a lot out of it.
[01:30:23.140 --> 01:30:25.220]   Veronica Belmont has SF Pizza.
[01:30:25.220 --> 01:30:27.660]   She has eight places in one of her pizza lists,
[01:30:27.660 --> 01:30:29.100]   so that's something that's--
[01:30:29.100 --> 01:30:30.700]   I've probably been to all those places,
[01:30:30.700 --> 01:30:32.420]   but let's say it was a new city.
[01:30:32.420 --> 01:30:34.700]   I would get something out of that, but up at the top,
[01:30:34.700 --> 01:30:36.220]   here's where it really gets cool.
[01:30:36.220 --> 01:30:38.060]   So I have Gee Lokey, myself, and Petaluma.
[01:30:38.060 --> 01:30:40.460]   Here we are at the Brick House, and, you know, we're near the water.
[01:30:40.460 --> 01:30:41.420]   That's me.
[01:30:41.420 --> 01:30:43.340]   And they have color-coded certain things,
[01:30:43.340 --> 01:30:46.740]   like it'll say "Suggestions" for Tuesday at 12.57 pm,
[01:30:46.740 --> 01:30:48.580]   because that's actually when I loaded this page.
[01:30:48.580 --> 01:30:51.420]   It's now 1.02 pm, Pacific time.
[01:30:51.420 --> 01:30:54.420]   Because it's still lunch, four squares now
[01:30:54.420 --> 01:30:58.140]   suggesting places where I might have lunch-type items.
[01:30:58.140 --> 01:30:59.780]   They're telling me to go to a food truck.
[01:30:59.780 --> 01:31:01.420]   They're telling me to go to High Tech Burrito,
[01:31:01.420 --> 01:31:02.620]   which is right down the street.
[01:31:02.620 --> 01:31:03.220]   Interesting.
[01:31:03.220 --> 01:31:04.940]   Yeah, and then you have color-coded,
[01:31:04.940 --> 01:31:07.100]   so there's featured places.
[01:31:07.100 --> 01:31:08.540]   There are places that are trending,
[01:31:08.540 --> 01:31:10.180]   so you see those places in blue.
[01:31:10.180 --> 01:31:12.380]   I also see people who are checked in near me.
[01:31:12.380 --> 01:31:14.380]   Eileen is actually checked in right--
[01:31:14.380 --> 01:31:15.700]   she's checked into the same place as me,
[01:31:15.700 --> 01:31:17.060]   so she's actually right in the back.
[01:31:17.060 --> 01:31:18.140]   On top of you, yeah.
[01:31:18.140 --> 01:31:19.500]   I assure you, we're in the same place.
[01:31:19.500 --> 01:31:20.100]   Here we are.
[01:31:20.100 --> 01:31:21.460]   There's Eileen.
[01:31:21.460 --> 01:31:26.020]   And then I can click on little places and figure out
[01:31:26.020 --> 01:31:28.300]   a little bit more about them, Oval Corp.
[01:31:28.300 --> 01:31:29.060]   I don't know.
[01:31:29.060 --> 01:31:30.460]   There's a photo of a pineapple there.
[01:31:30.460 --> 01:31:31.620]   They can't be all bad.
[01:31:31.620 --> 01:31:32.500]   I really like this.
[01:31:32.500 --> 01:31:34.580]   And then, of course, I've got my little notifications,
[01:31:34.580 --> 01:31:36.540]   which is similar to how it works in iOS.
[01:31:36.540 --> 01:31:39.860]   And if I click on that, I see that I have a few friends' requests.
[01:31:39.860 --> 01:31:42.060]   It actually makes four squares something
[01:31:42.060 --> 01:31:45.180]   that I will load up in my browser, rather than never
[01:31:45.180 --> 01:31:46.460]   even going through the trouble in the past.
[01:31:46.460 --> 01:31:47.100]   So I'm into it.
[01:31:47.100 --> 01:31:48.780]   She's been engaged and married since we met you last night.
[01:31:48.780 --> 01:31:50.620]   This is my right hand, not my left.
[01:31:50.620 --> 01:31:51.100]   OK.
[01:31:51.100 --> 01:31:51.740]   Just checking.
[01:31:51.740 --> 01:31:52.540]   Yeah, big dummy.
[01:31:52.540 --> 01:31:53.420]   Just checking.
[01:31:53.420 --> 01:31:55.180]   Well, it looks like you've got an engagement
[01:31:55.180 --> 01:31:56.460]   in a wedding ring on your right hand.
[01:31:56.460 --> 01:31:57.100]   What does that mean?
[01:31:57.100 --> 01:31:59.420]   An engagement ring is usually not made of peridow,
[01:31:59.420 --> 01:32:01.180]   which is a semi-precious stone.
[01:32:01.180 --> 01:32:01.700]   All right.
[01:32:01.700 --> 01:32:02.340]   So I can't tell.
[01:32:02.340 --> 01:32:02.980]   What do I know?
[01:32:02.980 --> 01:32:03.700]   I'm not engaged.
[01:32:03.700 --> 01:32:04.300]   What do I know?
[01:32:04.300 --> 01:32:04.820]   That's all you need to know.
[01:32:04.820 --> 01:32:06.300]   I think your fingers are tuning blue, though.
[01:32:06.300 --> 01:32:09.940]   You might want to get some oxygen.
[01:32:09.940 --> 01:32:11.860]   They're turning turquoise.
[01:32:11.860 --> 01:32:12.380]   Turquoise.
[01:32:12.380 --> 01:32:13.260]   By design.
[01:32:13.260 --> 01:32:14.660]   All right.
[01:32:14.660 --> 01:32:16.420]   I think it's time for Andy.
[01:32:16.420 --> 01:32:19.180]   And not coz pick of the week.
[01:32:19.180 --> 01:32:21.540]   My pick is the new version of Pixelmator,
[01:32:21.540 --> 01:32:24.260]   which just got upgraded to version 2.0.
[01:32:24.260 --> 01:32:26.860]   It is one of the Acorn and Pixelmator
[01:32:26.860 --> 01:32:31.140]   are the two nicest Mac specific image editors you can get.
[01:32:31.140 --> 01:32:33.900]   If you've got 500 bucks, you want Photoshop.
[01:32:33.900 --> 01:32:37.060]   If you don't got 500 bucks, you want one of these two.
[01:32:37.060 --> 01:32:40.300]   And of the two, Pixelmator is my favorite.
[01:32:40.300 --> 01:32:42.900]   They're both sort of updated rather regularly.
[01:32:42.900 --> 01:32:45.020]   And right now, Pixelmator, I think, is at the top of the heap.
[01:32:45.020 --> 01:32:46.980]   They added enough--
[01:32:46.980 --> 01:32:50.220]   most of what they added was making it the line compatible.
[01:32:50.220 --> 01:32:51.380]   So you get versioning.
[01:32:51.380 --> 01:32:52.380]   You get full screen mode.
[01:32:52.380 --> 01:32:53.860]   You get all the sort of stuff.
[01:32:53.860 --> 01:32:55.420]   The interface is so--
[01:32:55.420 --> 01:32:59.740]   they so truly followed the lead of Apple's other apps,
[01:32:59.740 --> 01:33:02.740]   like Final Cut, like Aperture, like iPhoto,
[01:33:02.740 --> 01:33:06.460]   that if you're using this $30 app, just as an image editor,
[01:33:06.460 --> 01:33:09.780]   just as the app that in iPhoto gets launched whenever
[01:33:09.780 --> 01:33:11.100]   you decide you want to edit something,
[01:33:11.100 --> 01:33:13.700]   instead of just using those thinking little sliders
[01:33:13.700 --> 01:33:17.620]   that iPhoto gives you go into a real image editor.
[01:33:17.620 --> 01:33:19.620]   You will almost feel as though you're still
[01:33:19.620 --> 01:33:23.260]   in the Apple world, because it all just works together so
[01:33:23.260 --> 01:33:24.140]   very, very well.
[01:33:24.140 --> 01:33:27.620]   But it supports all the good features of Photoshop.
[01:33:27.620 --> 01:33:32.460]   It makes Photoshop editing worth it, like layers, filters.
[01:33:32.460 --> 01:33:35.300]   They've added a lot of support for content-aware fills.
[01:33:35.300 --> 01:33:38.780]   So if you're editing a picture and there's
[01:33:38.780 --> 01:33:42.300]   a honeymoon picture is really, really great,
[01:33:42.300 --> 01:33:44.660]   except for this really stupid paraglider
[01:33:44.660 --> 01:33:49.340]   who's advertising Quairvo in the sky above your wife's head,
[01:33:49.340 --> 01:33:51.660]   you can just select it, do a content-aware fill,
[01:33:51.660 --> 01:33:54.180]   and it will basically paint in sky and clouds
[01:33:54.180 --> 01:33:56.540]   so that that thing suddenly becomes invisible.
[01:33:56.540 --> 01:33:58.420]   So long, long list of things that they've added.
[01:33:58.420 --> 01:34:02.060]   But above all, the character of this upgrade
[01:34:02.060 --> 01:34:05.500]   is that they've turned it from a Mac paint clone
[01:34:05.500 --> 01:34:08.060]   into a Photoshop clone.
[01:34:08.060 --> 01:34:10.460]   It was always-- 1.0 was always a very, very good editor,
[01:34:10.460 --> 01:34:14.220]   but it was missing a handful of those special tools
[01:34:14.220 --> 01:34:19.380]   like for blurring, sponging, advanced type, advanced paths.
[01:34:19.380 --> 01:34:23.300]   If you want to add path selections or add graphics
[01:34:23.300 --> 01:34:27.540]   into an image, that sort of was the thick line
[01:34:27.540 --> 01:34:30.860]   between stuff that this $30 app can do
[01:34:30.860 --> 01:34:33.100]   and stuff that a $500 app can do.
[01:34:33.100 --> 01:34:35.500]   Right now, I think the Pixelmator is the app that you choose,
[01:34:35.500 --> 01:34:37.460]   because it's what most people are going to need
[01:34:37.460 --> 01:34:40.300]   if they just want to do something simple
[01:34:40.300 --> 01:34:43.620]   to edit a photo where the photo is pretty good,
[01:34:43.620 --> 01:34:46.620]   but you just wish that the eyes in the face were a little bit
[01:34:46.620 --> 01:34:48.780]   brighter so that they weren't quite so hidden by shadow.
[01:34:48.780 --> 01:34:50.700]   Well, just double click on it in iPhoto.
[01:34:50.700 --> 01:34:53.460]   You've set Pixelmator as your image editor for this app.
[01:34:53.460 --> 01:34:56.020]   And so you can just simply do a very, very quick, clean,
[01:34:56.020 --> 01:34:58.060]   smart selection of just the eye area,
[01:34:58.060 --> 01:35:01.780]   add in an adjustment layer so that you can quickly just
[01:35:01.780 --> 01:35:05.300]   make exposure and color changes just to that selected area.
[01:35:05.300 --> 01:35:07.660]   And then, once you're done, you get dumped back into iPhoto
[01:35:07.660 --> 01:35:10.060]   with your changes intact.
[01:35:10.060 --> 01:35:12.500]   Right now, it's just been available for the past couple
[01:35:12.500 --> 01:35:14.020]   of weeks, this new upgrade.
[01:35:14.020 --> 01:35:18.900]   They say that it's a time-limited discount of $29.99,
[01:35:18.900 --> 01:35:20.620]   but it's a great $30 to spend.
[01:35:20.620 --> 01:35:23.100]   If you don't have a real image editor on your Mac yet,
[01:35:23.100 --> 01:35:27.260]   chiefly because you've been scared off of Photoshop's price tag,
[01:35:27.260 --> 01:35:29.300]   I think Mac users, real Mac users,
[01:35:29.300 --> 01:35:31.300]   can be very, very happy with Pixelmator.
[01:35:31.300 --> 01:35:34.260]   Now, I bought one of what I guess is probably not an upgrade
[01:35:34.260 --> 01:35:35.820]   deal, huh?
[01:35:35.820 --> 01:35:38.660]   Well, I think there is actually--
[01:35:38.660 --> 01:35:40.660]   Well, if you haven't actually already bought it through the app
[01:35:40.660 --> 01:35:42.460]   store, I'm not sure if there's an upgrade.
[01:35:42.460 --> 01:35:44.860]   Yeah, yeah, you see, that's the problem, yeah, right, exactly.
[01:35:44.860 --> 01:35:48.860]   Because I bought it when there was no app store.
[01:35:48.860 --> 01:35:50.300]   That's worth $30.
[01:35:50.300 --> 01:35:50.860]   Well, worth it.
[01:35:50.860 --> 01:35:51.340]   It's worth $30.
[01:35:51.340 --> 01:35:54.020]   Again, it's very, very pretty, very nicely produced.
[01:35:54.020 --> 01:35:54.860]   It's a lot for it.
[01:35:54.860 --> 01:35:56.900]   And instead of Photoshop.
[01:35:56.900 --> 01:35:58.620]   Thank you, Andy and Notko.
[01:35:58.620 --> 01:35:59.460]   I had a pick.
[01:35:59.460 --> 01:36:01.860]   I was going to show the up band, but I think we'll save that
[01:36:01.860 --> 01:36:02.820]   for another day.
[01:36:02.820 --> 01:36:04.260]   What do you say?
[01:36:04.260 --> 01:36:05.660]   But I do like it.
[01:36:05.660 --> 01:36:06.540]   It's pretty cool.
[01:36:06.540 --> 01:36:08.540]   Well, that's the key to the five I ever heard one.
[01:36:08.540 --> 01:36:09.040]   Yeah.
[01:36:09.040 --> 01:36:09.540]   You talked about it.
[01:36:09.540 --> 01:36:10.820]   I love Matt's, yeah.
[01:36:10.820 --> 01:36:12.100]   You talked about it on Twitter.
[01:36:12.100 --> 01:36:12.540]   I know.
[01:36:12.540 --> 01:36:14.060]   And it's going to be--
[01:36:14.060 --> 01:36:15.500]   Giz was one next week.
[01:36:15.500 --> 01:36:16.140]   Go ahead, Andy.
[01:36:16.140 --> 01:36:17.740]   You had lunch with somebody breakfast with them.
[01:36:17.740 --> 01:36:19.740]   Yeah, as a matter of fact, I had breakfast with a couple
[01:36:19.740 --> 01:36:21.460]   of people, and one of them had the up band, and he showed
[01:36:21.460 --> 01:36:23.700]   it to me and said, well, that's good, kind of cool.
[01:36:23.700 --> 01:36:25.100]   That's how it was stated in the iPhone.
[01:36:25.100 --> 01:36:26.700]   That's pretty slick, oh, god dang it.
[01:36:26.700 --> 01:36:27.860]   That's a wonderful link.
[01:36:27.860 --> 01:36:29.300]   And I'll see it all well.
[01:36:29.300 --> 01:36:32.420]   Well, the reason it's a pick is because you have to have an
[01:36:32.420 --> 01:36:35.340]   iPhone to use it, because there's a free iPhone app.
[01:36:35.340 --> 01:36:36.540]   And otherwise, it does absolutely--
[01:36:36.540 --> 01:36:38.260]   it's a pedometer that does absolutely nothing.
[01:36:38.260 --> 01:36:39.100]   But I like it.
[01:36:39.100 --> 01:36:40.180]   Just so happens, Leo.
[01:36:40.180 --> 01:36:42.020]   You're wearing one too.
[01:36:42.020 --> 01:36:43.660]   OK, well, all right, then I'm going to do it.
[01:36:43.660 --> 01:36:44.860]   Now, let me just say something--
[01:36:44.860 --> 01:36:46.220]   You know those guys and get one.
[01:36:46.220 --> 01:36:49.820]   Let me just say something, though.
[01:36:49.820 --> 01:36:52.780]   You could see that Don has a nice little cap on his plug at
[01:36:52.780 --> 01:36:53.180]   the one end.
[01:36:53.180 --> 01:36:54.220]   Mine has fallen off.
[01:36:54.220 --> 01:36:56.220]   And I think they fall off very easily.
[01:36:56.220 --> 01:36:58.860]   I'm told that they will give you one for free, and then
[01:36:58.860 --> 01:37:02.140]   after you lose your first one, after you lose your second
[01:37:02.140 --> 01:37:02.980]   one, then you have to buy them.
[01:37:02.980 --> 01:37:04.140]   But they're not very expensive.
[01:37:04.140 --> 01:37:05.860]   And that plugs into the iPhone here in Australia.
[01:37:05.860 --> 01:37:08.860]   Get on a list as the guy who's asked for three now.
[01:37:08.860 --> 01:37:10.420]   And now you don't get anymore.
[01:37:10.420 --> 01:37:11.020]   You don't get anymore.
[01:37:11.020 --> 01:37:13.580]   And look around for it, because I think I lost it here.
[01:37:13.580 --> 01:37:14.060]   I know you.
[01:37:14.060 --> 01:37:15.860]   I had it on Twitter.
[01:37:15.860 --> 01:37:17.740]   Anyway, so what it is, it's a band.
[01:37:17.740 --> 01:37:19.220]   It's a pedometer, just like the Fitbit.
[01:37:19.220 --> 01:37:20.700]   Remember the Fitbit?
[01:37:20.700 --> 01:37:25.260]   It watches your movements and records your steps.
[01:37:25.260 --> 01:37:27.380]   But it also records your sleep patterns, like the Fitbit
[01:37:27.380 --> 01:37:28.660]   did.
[01:37:28.660 --> 01:37:30.340]   And you take pictures of your food.
[01:37:30.340 --> 01:37:31.780]   It has a nice iPhone app.
[01:37:31.780 --> 01:37:34.740]   And unlike the Fitbit, the Fitbit would just wirelessly
[01:37:34.740 --> 01:37:36.940]   sync with your Mac and had a website.
[01:37:36.940 --> 01:37:41.300]   This, you plug into the audio jack of your iPhone, which
[01:37:41.300 --> 01:37:42.620]   is kind of interesting.
[01:37:42.620 --> 01:37:45.580]   And then it has a special sync button.
[01:37:45.580 --> 01:37:47.940]   Let's go back to the top here.
[01:37:47.940 --> 01:37:50.940]   And just like loading in basic programs on your Apple too.
[01:37:50.940 --> 01:37:53.260]   Just plug into the audio jack, press play.
[01:37:53.260 --> 01:37:54.700]   This is how the square works as well.
[01:37:54.700 --> 01:37:57.460]   So obviously, there's apparently a well-known way
[01:37:57.460 --> 01:37:59.660]   to do audio transfer.
[01:37:59.660 --> 01:38:02.260]   The MotionX hardware in here was developed by Philippe Kahn,
[01:38:02.260 --> 01:38:05.420]   a guy who did the Borland Pascal.
[01:38:05.420 --> 01:38:06.780]   And so now it's in here.
[01:38:06.780 --> 01:38:08.860]   I just put in my most recent steps.
[01:38:08.860 --> 01:38:11.740]   I take pictures of my food, and that goes in there too.
[01:38:11.740 --> 01:38:14.460]   And you could see your sleep cycles, which have not been
[01:38:14.460 --> 01:38:15.260]   very good.
[01:38:15.260 --> 01:38:18.540]   One thing I did notice that I just, for instance,
[01:38:18.540 --> 01:38:19.300]   was at the gym.
[01:38:19.300 --> 01:38:20.940]   It saw me rowing.
[01:38:20.940 --> 01:38:22.940]   But this whole area is on a stairmaster.
[01:38:22.940 --> 01:38:24.220]   Didn't see that.
[01:38:24.220 --> 01:38:25.540]   So that's not so good, right?
[01:38:25.540 --> 01:38:26.980]   You want to be rewarded for your hard work.
[01:38:26.980 --> 01:38:28.540]   I did a lot of steps in there.
[01:38:28.540 --> 01:38:31.820]   And it thinks I was just sitting on my behind.
[01:38:31.820 --> 01:38:33.820]   So that's not so good.
[01:38:33.820 --> 01:38:36.900]   And I think that that's because a wrist band is not
[01:38:36.900 --> 01:38:39.620]   going to do as well as a pedometer as a hip-based device.
[01:38:39.620 --> 01:38:41.980]   On the other hand, I keep losing the Fitbit.
[01:38:41.980 --> 01:38:43.980]   This one is going to be a lot harder to lose.
[01:38:43.980 --> 01:38:44.540]   I like it.
[01:38:44.540 --> 01:38:45.900]   Don, you like it?
[01:38:45.900 --> 01:38:46.820]   Yeah.
[01:38:46.820 --> 01:38:48.980]   The food thing doesn't quite--
[01:38:48.980 --> 01:38:51.900]   I think they need to make the food part of it a bit better,
[01:38:51.900 --> 01:38:53.900]   because just taking photos and then asking your questions
[01:38:53.900 --> 01:38:55.620]   about it doesn't really do it for me.
[01:38:55.620 --> 01:38:57.180]   It's waterproof as well, so I've used it.
[01:38:57.180 --> 01:38:59.540]   Although it says it's waterproof down to a meter.
[01:38:59.540 --> 01:39:00.540]   Up to a meter.
[01:39:00.540 --> 01:39:01.060]   Yeah.
[01:39:01.060 --> 01:39:04.340]   And it does-- they do say don't use it for swimming,
[01:39:04.340 --> 01:39:05.740]   although I think they've changed the mind.
[01:39:05.740 --> 01:39:08.020]   I think they said it was OK to swim, but now it's not.
[01:39:08.020 --> 01:39:08.860]   But I've tried it swimming.
[01:39:08.860 --> 01:39:09.700]   It's fine.
[01:39:09.700 --> 01:39:11.620]   But I like the sleep pattern things.
[01:39:11.620 --> 01:39:13.500]   And you can also set the smart alarm
[01:39:13.500 --> 01:39:15.420]   so that it will wake you up at the right part of sleep
[01:39:15.420 --> 01:39:15.420]   time.
[01:39:15.420 --> 01:39:16.260]   I forgot to mention that.
[01:39:16.260 --> 01:39:19.020]   Yeah, Buzz is when you're in your light sleep cycle,
[01:39:19.020 --> 01:39:21.260]   so you don't wake up when you're in a deep sleep.
[01:39:21.260 --> 01:39:21.580]   Yeah.
[01:39:21.580 --> 01:39:23.420]   And there's also an inactivity timer
[01:39:23.420 --> 01:39:25.220]   so that if you're inactive for 15 minutes,
[01:39:25.220 --> 01:39:26.500]   I mean, it will vibrate on your wrist
[01:39:26.500 --> 01:39:29.500]   to remind you to go and take a walk.
[01:39:29.500 --> 01:39:31.220]   There's a social aspect to it too.
[01:39:31.220 --> 01:39:32.700]   People can give you challenges.
[01:39:32.700 --> 01:39:35.260]   You can see how other people are sleeping and doing,
[01:39:35.260 --> 01:39:36.060]   which is kind of fun.
[01:39:36.060 --> 01:39:37.220]   Don, I'm going to follow you on here.
[01:39:37.220 --> 01:39:39.940]   I'll make you one of my buddies.
[01:39:39.940 --> 01:39:40.900]   $99.
[01:39:40.900 --> 01:39:43.140]   I think this is-- the whole idea is motivate you
[01:39:43.140 --> 01:39:45.700]   to stay in shape to give a good night's sleep to eat right.
[01:39:45.700 --> 01:39:47.620]   The fact that you're taking pictures of your food
[01:39:47.620 --> 01:39:49.780]   and then record how you felt afterwards, you're right.
[01:39:49.780 --> 01:39:51.180]   I mean, it's not a calorie counter,
[01:39:51.180 --> 01:39:53.660]   but it does make you more aware of what you're eating
[01:39:53.660 --> 01:39:55.340]   if you have to take a picture of everything.
[01:39:55.340 --> 01:39:57.580]   So I don't think that's so bad.
[01:39:57.580 --> 01:40:00.580]   I think it's very interesting, you know?
[01:40:00.580 --> 01:40:01.780]   It's fun.
[01:40:01.780 --> 01:40:03.700]   So that's called the Up from Jawbone.
[01:40:03.700 --> 01:40:05.780]   I wasn't going to pick it, but I guess I have.
[01:40:05.780 --> 01:40:06.980]   There you go.
[01:40:06.980 --> 01:40:07.700]   I like it.
[01:40:07.700 --> 01:40:08.900]   And we'll see.
[01:40:08.900 --> 01:40:11.140]   Anything that helps me get more exercise
[01:40:11.140 --> 01:40:13.460]   and eat right is a good thing.
[01:40:13.460 --> 01:40:15.700]   Don McAllister is at Screencast online.
[01:40:15.700 --> 01:40:17.500]   Don't forget he's got that new T.
[01:40:17.500 --> 01:40:17.820]   What is it?
[01:40:17.820 --> 01:40:19.060]   SCO Tister?
[01:40:19.060 --> 01:40:20.020]   Toot up the lion.
[01:40:20.020 --> 01:40:21.940]   For lion, you can find that in the app store
[01:40:21.940 --> 01:40:24.940]   or get your screencast there at Screencast online.
[01:40:24.940 --> 01:40:26.580]   Com, thanks for being here, Don.
[01:40:26.580 --> 01:40:28.780]   Thanks for letting Sarah Lane go over to the TNT set
[01:40:28.780 --> 01:40:30.620]   where she's going to get ready for tech news today.
[01:40:30.620 --> 01:40:31.620]   That's very true.
[01:40:31.620 --> 01:40:35.460]   230 Pacific, 530 Eastern, our daily news show with Tom Merritt
[01:40:35.460 --> 01:40:36.540]   and I as Actar.
[01:40:36.540 --> 01:40:40.140]   She's also the host of the Social Hour on Mondays
[01:40:40.140 --> 01:40:41.740]   and iPad today on Thursdays.
[01:40:41.740 --> 01:40:42.460]   With you.
[01:40:42.460 --> 01:40:43.300]   And we have a lot of fun.
[01:40:43.300 --> 01:40:45.460]   I think that's a great show if you're an iPad owner
[01:40:45.460 --> 01:40:46.620]   or you're interested.
[01:40:46.620 --> 01:40:47.340]   Want to know more about the iPad?
[01:40:47.340 --> 01:40:49.020]   We even have a lot of people who say,
[01:40:49.020 --> 01:40:50.220]   don't even have an iPad yet.
[01:40:50.220 --> 01:40:51.220]   Want to, but don't.
[01:40:51.220 --> 01:40:51.700]   Should we?
[01:40:51.700 --> 01:40:52.220]   Should we add--
[01:40:52.220 --> 01:40:52.700]   I still like the show.
[01:40:52.700 --> 01:40:54.500]   Should we add Kindle Fire coverage to our show?
[01:40:54.500 --> 01:40:55.500]   No.
[01:40:55.500 --> 01:40:57.380]   I think that's a different show.
[01:40:57.380 --> 01:40:57.900]   That's--
[01:40:57.900 --> 01:40:59.100]   Are you going to do that all about Android?
[01:40:59.100 --> 01:40:59.700]   Oh, yeah.
[01:40:59.700 --> 01:41:01.020]   This is not an Android device.
[01:41:01.020 --> 01:41:03.300]   It's just an illusion.
[01:41:03.300 --> 01:41:04.580]   You think that's an Android device?
[01:41:04.580 --> 01:41:06.140]   It's got-- yes.
[01:41:06.140 --> 01:41:08.700]   Eventually, we'll probably have to have some crossover show
[01:41:08.700 --> 01:41:11.140]   between our show and all about Android.
[01:41:11.140 --> 01:41:11.940]   I'm the only one getting it.
[01:41:11.940 --> 01:41:13.020]   But for now, you should--
[01:41:13.020 --> 01:41:13.520]   All right.
[01:41:13.520 --> 01:41:14.020]   All right.
[01:41:14.020 --> 01:41:15.140]   So watch all about Android.
[01:41:15.140 --> 01:41:16.580]   What's got Android apps?
[01:41:16.580 --> 01:41:17.300]   So--
[01:41:17.300 --> 01:41:18.060]   Right.
[01:41:18.060 --> 01:41:19.300]   That's true.
[01:41:19.300 --> 01:41:20.580]   That's true.
[01:41:20.580 --> 01:41:23.260]   Andy Anakko is at the Chicago Sun Times
[01:41:23.260 --> 01:41:26.260]   where he works with Roger Ebert and--
