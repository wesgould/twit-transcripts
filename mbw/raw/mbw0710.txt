[00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:58.480]   Hello.

[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.800]   Good to see you.
[00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:18.800]   Welcome.
[00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:19.800]   You're still an I'm more.
[00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:21.440]   I've missed Lori so much.
[00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:22.440]   Okay.
[00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:23.440]   Did you get the memo?
[00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:24.440]   I missed the two today.
[00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:26.120]   Last person and I more turned out the lights.
[00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:27.120]   No, that's a terrible.
[00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:28.120]   They're growing.
[00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:30.880]   She has expanded that team and they are crushing it.
[00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:31.880]   It is amazing.
[00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:32.880]   Oh, that's great.
[00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:33.880]   I'm glad you're here.
[00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:34.880]   That's really good.
[00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:39.120]   Hey, I wanted to wish a happy birthday to Joe.
[00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:40.320]   Happy birthday Joe.
[00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:41.320]   Happy birthday Joe.
[00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:42.960]   He says it's his 40th.
[00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:44.520]   We closed the studio.
[00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:50.640]   Why don't we stop having people in the studio, John, early before the shelter in place orders.
[00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:54.480]   Some maybe two months ago, early March.
[00:02:54.480 --> 00:03:00.000]   Because some employees were a little worried about what this new virus that seemed to be
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.840]   going around.
[00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:04.680]   I thought, well, we get visitors from all over the world.
[00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:08.680]   There's no point in taking a chance with my precious team.
[00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:09.680]   We closed the studio.
[00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:18.400]   Joe was planning to come here for his 40th birthday on April 30th in about nine days.
[00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:21.040]   His wife said, "Could you, he can't be here.
[00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:22.680]   I'm sorry, Joe.
[00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:24.680]   You'll be on your 41st.
[00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:26.680]   Actually at this rate, maybe your 45th.
[00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:27.680]   Maybe your 51th."
[00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:28.680]   I don't know.
[00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:29.760]   We'll get you to do over.
[00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:33.560]   But in the meantime, we thought we'd wish you a happy birthday.
[00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:34.640]   She said, "Could you set us a video?"
[00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:37.920]   I said, "We'll put it in the beginning of Mac break weekly.
[00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:39.600]   Our fans are that important to us."
[00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:42.280]   To make a song request.
[00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:45.600]   What would we like to sing, Andrew?
[00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:49.640]   How about, again, I have to go with Kudetah.
[00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:50.640]   Okay.
[00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:51.640]   Why is that?
[00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:56.280]   Kudetah, Kudetah, easy listening version, of course, because we want to branch out to
[00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:00.560]   as many markets as possible.
[00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:04.040]   You can sit in the car outside if you want, and I'll wave through the window.
[00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:05.960]   That's all I can offer.
[00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:08.920]   Drive through professionals.
[00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:11.760]   So Apple did it to us again.
[00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:13.680]   John Prosser was right.
[00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:18.160]   He was, his predictions were really right on for the iPhone SE.
[00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:21.040]   He even said it will come out on Wednesday.
[00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:23.680]   And that's not Apple's normal MO.
[00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:27.160]   Usually they do it on Tuesday.
[00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:28.520]   But he decided to screw us.
[00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:30.960]   Apple decided to screw us, and after the show was over.
[00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:32.600]   We'll get those two guys.
[00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:35.120]   It was all about getting me.
[00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:36.120]   I know.
[00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:39.400]   No, they released a brand new iPhone SE.
[00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:43.040]   Again, Prosser knew nothing we didn't know about it.
[00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:44.320]   You've reviewed it, Renee.
[00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:47.800]   Did you get it earlier if you just had it for a week?
[00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:50.800]   Actually, there have not been any reviews yet.
[00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:54.400]   I just got to talk to Apple about it on release day and then up my thoughts.
[00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:55.400]   Nice.
[00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:57.480]   So what did you think?
[00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:58.480]   I really like it.
[00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:00.240]   I think it's very similar to the original.
[00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:03.160]   I know before Lori hits me, it's not the same size as the original.
[00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:05.960]   But it's very similar in spirit to the original.
[00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:10.280]   And that is like it takes a classic familiar form factor that some segment of the market
[00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:15.160]   really, really likes, including things like the home button and lock and touch ID for
[00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:17.800]   people who aren't as comfortable navigating without the home button.
[00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:19.000]   It's their escape hatch.
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.560]   Or just don't like the idea of face ID, especially now that we're all wearing masks.
[00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:27.640]   And then puts Apple's latest processor in a much better camera and puts that $399 price
[00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:28.640]   tag on.
[00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:33.440]   So it sort of hits both the classic iPhone market, the I want the latest specs market,
[00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:36.880]   and the I'm not paying more than 400 bucks for a damn iPhone market.
[00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:40.560]   And that's a much bigger market than you do than you get just by making the previous
[00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:43.400]   iPhone 100 bucks cheaper every year.
[00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:47.560]   The XR was very, very popular.
[00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:50.600]   Was the iPhone SE the original more popular than that even?
[00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:52.160]   It was more popular than Apple thought.
[00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:53.160]   Hello, I'm sorry.
[00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:54.160]   I'm talking on my iPhone.
[00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:56.960]   Oh, look how small it was.
[00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:57.960]   It's so cute.
[00:05:57.960 --> 00:05:58.960]   It's so funny.
[00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:01.560]   It's the Richard Donner Superman SE.
[00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:06.200]   It looks like an iPhone 5, but it feels like an iPhone, what, 7, 8?
[00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:11.120]   Well, no, it's actually probably more like an iPhone 6.
[00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:13.800]   It does match your hair.
[00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:17.400]   I have to say it said rose gold is looking very nice on you.
[00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:18.920]   Look at how cute it is.
[00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:22.120]   So you knew though that they weren't going to do a four inch phone, right?
[00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:25.600]   Yeah, I gave up on that hope a long time ago.
[00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:31.920]   I was just going to say before that it's, sorry, I totally lost my train of thought.
[00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:33.880]   Oh, sorry, I changed the subject.
[00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:36.200]   They couldn't do a four inch phone.
[00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:39.800]   No, yeah, but before that I lost it.
[00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:43.080]   It's like the four inch phone we know because they've stopped developing iOS at that screen
[00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:49.480]   size and if you pull up the keyboard in landscape mode, you basically have a field and a keyboard.
[00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:51.160]   There's no more screen anymore.
[00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:54.960]   And then the processors, the analogy I used is if you move into a bigger apartment, you
[00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:58.840]   start accumulating things and then it's really hard to go back to a smaller apartment.
[00:06:58.840 --> 00:06:59.840]   And this is the same.
[00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:03.160]   They got used to having that big battery, which is much better at handling power spikes
[00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:06.860]   and that bigger thermal envelope, which is much better for like for sustained processor
[00:07:06.860 --> 00:07:09.640]   performance and they just grew into that space.
[00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:13.600]   And in order to go back into the smaller space, they'd have to make a processor that was better
[00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:16.040]   at smaller thermal envelopes and not as power hungry.
[00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:18.560]   And that's a new processor and you can't charge 400 bucks for that.
[00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:22.840]   Now that you put it that way, I don't know how we survived with the iPhone 1, 2, 3,
[00:07:22.840 --> 00:07:23.840]   4 and 5.
[00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:24.840]   We were a simpler people.
[00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:25.840]   It was a simpler time.
[00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:31.960]   We didn't have tick-tock and Pokemon Go and we didn't have HDR.
[00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:33.880]   We didn't have Disney Play.
[00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:34.880]   The internet was yeah.
[00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:38.280]   Is it a deal breaker for you that they don't have a small phone?
[00:07:38.280 --> 00:07:39.280]   No.
[00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:40.680]   So here's what I think.
[00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:47.760]   Renee is dead on that this in spirit is the same thing that the original iPhone SE was.
[00:07:47.760 --> 00:07:49.320]   And here's why.
[00:07:49.320 --> 00:07:54.880]   For me, when the iPhone SE came out, it was years that they had made the larger phone
[00:07:54.880 --> 00:07:58.960]   that I didn't like and I didn't want and I stuck with my iPhone 5S.
[00:07:58.960 --> 00:08:05.760]   I wanted a phone that was that size, but I wanted an upgrade to the internals.
[00:08:05.760 --> 00:08:11.080]   I wanted to be faster and have all the new technology, Apple Pay and all that stuff.
[00:08:11.080 --> 00:08:12.520]   So the SE comes out.
[00:08:12.520 --> 00:08:13.960]   I got what I wanted.
[00:08:13.960 --> 00:08:15.520]   It's not top of the line.
[00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:18.160]   There's a couple of little things where they're saving money.
[00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:19.160]   Only one.
[00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:20.960]   So that the phone is too firm.
[00:08:20.960 --> 00:08:21.960]   Right.
[00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:25.400]   But I got my 4-inch iPhone.
[00:08:25.400 --> 00:08:31.240]   So today, for all those people out there that refuse to upgrade to an iPhone with Face ID,
[00:08:31.240 --> 00:08:32.480]   this is the same thing.
[00:08:32.480 --> 00:08:33.480]   This is their gift.
[00:08:33.480 --> 00:08:38.560]   This is Apple's gift to the holdouts that want Touch ID.
[00:08:38.560 --> 00:08:40.320]   It's inexpensive.
[00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:42.600]   It has super fast internals.
[00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:47.800]   There's a little bit of a budget making happening by only one camera, though it has
[00:08:47.800 --> 00:08:52.320]   more advanced dynamic, extended dynamic range.
[00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:58.720]   So it's actually more advanced than the iPhone XR camera in terms of its digital processing.
[00:08:58.720 --> 00:09:00.160]   But it's a compromise.
[00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:01.880]   So Apple is saying, "We get it.
[00:09:01.880 --> 00:09:03.960]   You don't want Face ID.
[00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:08.720]   Here's an updated Touch ID phone that meets as many standards as we can give you while
[00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:10.120]   still keeping the price really low."
[00:09:10.120 --> 00:09:16.920]   So for everybody who was on an iPhone 8, 7, 6, they didn't want Face ID.
[00:09:16.920 --> 00:09:18.560]   This is perfect for them.
[00:09:18.560 --> 00:09:25.680]   As Adam Inks says in his article about the size of the low-cost iPhone SE disappointing,
[00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:32.000]   sorry, Apple hates you in your tiny hands and your small purses and pockets.
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:33.040]   I mean, every vendor does.
[00:09:33.040 --> 00:09:39.920]   I don't know anybody except that Palm license by TCL that's been anywhere near small lately.
[00:09:39.920 --> 00:09:44.600]   I kept hoping that there was going to be this new retro trend where companies would start
[00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:48.800]   making smaller phones out of nowhere, but that hasn't happened yet.
[00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:49.800]   It's the Apple watch.
[00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:50.800]   That's the small phone now.
[00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:51.800]   Yeah.
[00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:56.200]   There's a rumor that there's an iPhone SE Plus, although according to Mac rumors today, that
[00:09:56.200 --> 00:09:59.800]   will be delayed because of COVID.
[00:09:59.800 --> 00:10:03.400]   But there should be an iPhone SE minus.
[00:10:03.400 --> 00:10:05.160]   The 12 is going to be smaller.
[00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:08.840]   The rumor is that the baseline 12, they'll be the same size as now.
[00:10:08.840 --> 00:10:13.040]   The, I forget what the current six point something, whatever is screen, that there'll
[00:10:13.040 --> 00:10:16.160]   be a one that is smaller than the iPad than the iPhone Pro.
[00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:20.240]   So it will be smaller than what you have now, but it will not be as ESOD.
[00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:21.680]   This is the problem, Laurie.
[00:10:21.680 --> 00:10:27.080]   And I'm sympathetic because Renee and I and Andy, I suspect and almost everybody else
[00:10:27.080 --> 00:10:32.360]   in the world, mostly guys with big hands, don't get it.
[00:10:32.360 --> 00:10:34.520]   We say, well, this isn't, this doesn't feel big.
[00:10:34.520 --> 00:10:36.040]   Your phone feels really small.
[00:10:36.040 --> 00:10:37.560]   Oh, I totally get it.
[00:10:37.560 --> 00:10:38.560]   You get it?
[00:10:38.560 --> 00:10:39.560]   Yeah.
[00:10:39.560 --> 00:10:44.280]   It's, it's one of those things where there's sexism, inherent in the design of hardware.
[00:10:44.280 --> 00:10:48.720]   That's kind of hard to ignore that when you, if you, it's not just women who want small
[00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:49.720]   phones.
[00:10:49.720 --> 00:10:52.960]   Well, it's also gender for sure.
[00:10:52.960 --> 00:10:53.960]   Right.
[00:10:53.960 --> 00:10:58.680]   Well, not, well, not only that, but it's there, but there is a difference in the size of pockets
[00:10:58.680 --> 00:11:00.240]   in different kinds of clothing.
[00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:06.520]   I would like to have the option of having a, like a sort of a grab it and go style phone
[00:11:06.520 --> 00:11:11.120]   in addition to like the big screen phone that I take for, if I'm going to be like on a
[00:11:11.120 --> 00:11:17.280]   on a bus or on a train for an hour, I really wish it were easier to do now that we have
[00:11:17.280 --> 00:11:22.720]   a digital's e-sims to maybe by NFC to simply have an app on two different phones and simply
[00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:26.200]   say, please transfer my e-sim from this phone to this phone.
[00:11:26.200 --> 00:11:27.200]   And then yeah, exactly.
[00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:31.120]   Cause they're, when I'm in New York for like three or four days, that's when like I pull
[00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:35.880]   out my physical sim out of like my normal size phone and put it, put it into even like
[00:11:35.880 --> 00:11:40.880]   an older like XL size phone because I'm going to need the extra screen real estate.
[00:11:40.880 --> 00:11:44.680]   But if I could just simply again, have something that's pocket size, even like a candy bar
[00:11:44.680 --> 00:11:47.880]   style phone, like the size of this.
[00:11:47.880 --> 00:11:49.680]   And again, just do a tap.
[00:11:49.680 --> 00:11:53.280]   And now when I'm going to the theater, when I really all I need this for is to get an
[00:11:53.280 --> 00:11:54.800]   emergency message.
[00:11:54.800 --> 00:11:56.760]   And mostly it's going to be turned off.
[00:11:56.760 --> 00:12:01.200]   That would be such a game changer and would really open up the market for sub $100 phones.
[00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:05.600]   I can't speak a little bit though to the fact that people aren't using these for phones
[00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:06.600]   anymore.
[00:12:06.600 --> 00:12:09.960]   Well, no, but there's also a thing where we said, like we voted with our wallets, like
[00:12:09.960 --> 00:12:11.360]   we bought bigger and bigger phones.
[00:12:11.360 --> 00:12:13.360]   Samsung put out the note, we made fun of them.
[00:12:13.360 --> 00:12:16.600]   And then we bought a ton of them and even Apple who's like, okay, we'll go to four.
[00:12:16.600 --> 00:12:17.600]   We'll go to four.
[00:12:17.600 --> 00:12:18.600]   Okay, fine.
[00:12:18.600 --> 00:12:20.120]   Here's your five inch phone.
[00:12:20.120 --> 00:12:23.120]   And there's just and a lot of I don't want to be that jerk, but there's a lot of places
[00:12:23.120 --> 00:12:27.440]   in the world where phones are still the primary computer, maybe the only computer for people.
[00:12:27.440 --> 00:12:30.760]   And people with really tiny hands want really enormous phones because it's the only screen
[00:12:30.760 --> 00:12:32.360]   that they have and they need to do their entire.
[00:12:32.360 --> 00:12:36.520]   >> Yeah, what my life is too small for my phone, I get mad at the pocket, not the phone.
[00:12:36.520 --> 00:12:40.960]   >> But if you wanted smaller, smaller, bigger phones would be making them.
[00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:42.580]   That's like these companies want money.
[00:12:42.580 --> 00:12:46.280]   If we told them in large numbers, we really prefer buying small phones.
[00:12:46.280 --> 00:12:47.280]   The market would be flooded.
[00:12:47.280 --> 00:12:50.640]   >> Lori, do you still make phone calls a lot?
[00:12:50.640 --> 00:12:58.480]   >> No, I actually switched over to when iPhone 10 came out, I switched over because I just,
[00:12:58.480 --> 00:13:00.900]   I needed to get an updated phone.
[00:13:00.900 --> 00:13:05.440]   So I still have the SE, I carried around with me, it's my beta tester.
[00:13:05.440 --> 00:13:06.440]   >> It's not even unique.
[00:13:06.440 --> 00:13:07.440]   >> But I don't use it regularly.
[00:13:07.440 --> 00:13:08.440]   >> It's not your daily drive, yeah.
[00:13:08.440 --> 00:13:09.440]   >> Right, it's not.
[00:13:09.440 --> 00:13:12.320]   >> You don't feel so strongly about this that you're not.
[00:13:12.320 --> 00:13:13.320]   >> Not anymore.
[00:13:13.320 --> 00:13:20.480]   It was probably about a year ago when there was still rumors of this iPhone SE 2, but we're
[00:13:20.480 --> 00:13:24.320]   getting a lot of information that it absolutely wasn't going to be a 4-inch iPhone that I
[00:13:24.320 --> 00:13:30.080]   was like, okay, Apple's never going to put out a 4-inch iPhone that has the kind of
[00:13:30.080 --> 00:13:33.720]   technological speeds that I need for today's technology.
[00:13:33.720 --> 00:13:35.920]   >> But that's a shame, right?
[00:13:35.920 --> 00:13:37.240]   I mean, you think- >> It is.
[00:13:37.240 --> 00:13:41.840]   >> So I was going to say, like, to what everyone's saying, it's not about the size of our hands,
[00:13:41.840 --> 00:13:47.520]   it's not about, although holding it in one hand, it's very nice when you're out of small
[00:13:47.520 --> 00:13:48.520]   hands.
[00:13:48.520 --> 00:13:53.440]   The way I think of a mobile phone, the way I think of a phone that I take outside with
[00:13:53.440 --> 00:13:55.680]   me is, what do I use it for?
[00:13:55.680 --> 00:14:01.160]   I use it to text message, sometimes I use it to use the maps.
[00:14:01.160 --> 00:14:05.560]   My face is in front of my phone while I'm wandering around in the world.
[00:14:05.560 --> 00:14:08.320]   Most people tend to be that way.
[00:14:08.320 --> 00:14:12.520]   There are some people whose faces in their phone most of the time, even outside, but
[00:14:12.520 --> 00:14:15.960]   a lot of us, it's just for checking in.
[00:14:15.960 --> 00:14:19.720]   And I have an iPad when I need a larger screen, but want the mobile experience.
[00:14:19.720 --> 00:14:24.160]   I have a computer when I want a full computer experience when I want to watch something
[00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:26.760]   on a bigger screen or something like that.
[00:14:26.760 --> 00:14:28.400]   So that's really what it's about.
[00:14:28.400 --> 00:14:33.000]   There's a lot of us who, not a lot of us, there's a small portion of us who want a
[00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:38.880]   phone, an iPhone that gives us everything we want in an iPhone, but we don't need to
[00:14:38.880 --> 00:14:39.880]   use it all.
[00:14:39.880 --> 00:14:43.360]   I don't need to watch something on that tiny foreign screen.
[00:14:43.360 --> 00:14:45.280]   It's there if I want it, but I don't need to.
[00:14:45.280 --> 00:14:47.640]   What I need is something that I can text message on.
[00:14:47.640 --> 00:14:49.280]   I can use the maps for.
[00:14:49.280 --> 00:14:53.880]   But what Renee is saying is also true, which is that I have the luxury of having three
[00:14:53.880 --> 00:14:56.760]   different screen sizes in my life.
[00:14:56.760 --> 00:15:01.240]   There's a lot of people out there for who the only screen they have is a mobile phone
[00:15:01.240 --> 00:15:03.160]   or a mobile device of some kind.
[00:15:03.160 --> 00:15:07.520]   So they deserve a larger screen.
[00:15:07.520 --> 00:15:12.400]   Should we backtrack to a four inch screen just because I want an extra screen moving
[00:15:12.400 --> 00:15:17.840]   forward allowing people to have the computer experience on a phone makes a lot of sense.
[00:15:17.840 --> 00:15:22.320]   I just wish that people had the option.
[00:15:22.320 --> 00:15:24.640]   That's all I have to say.
[00:15:24.640 --> 00:15:28.040]   I'm very, very aware through the years that there are lots of different ideas that I advocate
[00:15:28.040 --> 00:15:32.960]   because I think that they're good solid ideas, but that's the perspective of me who spends
[00:15:32.960 --> 00:15:34.920]   all day thinking about this stuff.
[00:15:34.920 --> 00:15:38.120]   It's one thing to say, "Gee, wouldn't it be great if phones were modular and you could
[00:15:38.120 --> 00:15:41.000]   just upgrade the camera without having to upgrade everything else?"
[00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:45.280]   But that, again, that's a great science fiction idea, but it's nowhere near practical and
[00:15:45.280 --> 00:15:49.280]   it's nowhere near desirable in a world where you can upgrade a whole phone for probably
[00:15:49.280 --> 00:15:53.160]   only 30% more than would cost to replace the camera module.
[00:15:53.160 --> 00:15:59.120]   All I'm saying is that I really do wish that if people wanted a smaller sized phone they
[00:15:59.120 --> 00:16:01.640]   could, it's a vicious cycle.
[00:16:01.640 --> 00:16:05.960]   It's very, very true that if people were absolutely adamant that there needs to be a
[00:16:05.960 --> 00:16:09.320]   smaller sized phone, everybody would be on it.
[00:16:09.320 --> 00:16:12.520]   And it would be easy to find in all kinds of product lines.
[00:16:12.520 --> 00:16:15.640]   Samsung is really the only company you can turn to, but that's only because they will
[00:16:15.640 --> 00:16:18.680]   make every single size possible as they can.
[00:16:18.680 --> 00:16:28.160]   But nonetheless, you can't do a situation where now the reason why people can't buy
[00:16:28.160 --> 00:16:32.840]   them is simply because they're not being offered as opposed to there's been an emphatic
[00:16:32.840 --> 00:16:35.120]   statement that nobody wants them.
[00:16:35.120 --> 00:16:40.320]   This is the problem and the burden that is unique to Apple because Apple is the only
[00:16:40.320 --> 00:16:42.520]   company that makes its hardware.
[00:16:42.520 --> 00:16:46.480]   So it's the same problem we've had with complaints of the keyboards on the Macs.
[00:16:46.480 --> 00:16:50.800]   You can't make a product for every group.
[00:16:50.800 --> 00:16:54.800]   If people want an iPhone, it's Apple's Wear the highway.
[00:16:54.800 --> 00:16:57.760]   And I think that's too bad, but I think it's just the nature of it.
[00:16:57.760 --> 00:17:03.920]   I wish, honestly, I wish Android were a little bit more, I am having a hard time these days
[00:17:03.920 --> 00:17:06.880]   recommending Android just because of the security issues.
[00:17:06.880 --> 00:17:12.320]   I wish Android were a little bit better because there are small Android phones.
[00:17:12.320 --> 00:17:13.920]   There's lots of them.
[00:17:13.920 --> 00:17:19.040]   But if you want an iPhone, you got to buy whatever Apple makes, period, regardless of
[00:17:19.040 --> 00:17:20.040]   their reasons.
[00:17:20.040 --> 00:17:21.880]   That's what they make.
[00:17:21.880 --> 00:17:22.880]   And that's kind of it.
[00:17:22.880 --> 00:17:25.400]   I think people want small Android phones too.
[00:17:25.400 --> 00:17:29.080]   You hear them complaining sometimes that everything comes in eight inch platters.
[00:17:29.080 --> 00:17:30.080]   Yeah.
[00:17:30.080 --> 00:17:35.520]   And I think there's probably a large plurality of people who want small phones and they're
[00:17:35.520 --> 00:17:37.480]   underserved, period.
[00:17:37.480 --> 00:17:38.480]   Yeah.
[00:17:38.480 --> 00:17:39.480]   And you can find them.
[00:17:39.480 --> 00:17:45.680]   The smallest phone I have is something I bought on Kickstarter that is about literally the
[00:17:45.680 --> 00:17:49.840]   size of a candy bar, almost the size of a fun sized candy bar.
[00:17:49.840 --> 00:17:54.240]   And it runs a version of Android that accesses the Google Play Store.
[00:17:54.240 --> 00:17:55.760]   So we'll get all modern apps.
[00:17:55.760 --> 00:18:05.080]   I bought it for $120, chiefly just to have a really, really good iPod touch that would
[00:18:05.080 --> 00:18:07.760]   be about the size of an iPod Nano.
[00:18:07.760 --> 00:18:11.520]   Being able to get all my music apps, all my podcast apps, everything that works with
[00:18:11.520 --> 00:18:12.760]   Google Play.
[00:18:12.760 --> 00:18:16.000]   So it's out there, but it's hard to find.
[00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:22.000]   And as usual, most people are just looking to buy phones that are at the phone store,
[00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:23.800]   in like least in the United States.
[00:18:23.800 --> 00:18:28.600]   Otherwise you have to go to Alibaba, you have to go to like third party places.
[00:18:28.600 --> 00:18:34.880]   Nokia has experimented with bringing back some of the original company's classic designs.
[00:18:34.880 --> 00:18:39.160]   They had the classic banana phone a couple years ago that was actually running Android,
[00:18:39.160 --> 00:18:41.480]   but in a flip phone form factor.
[00:18:41.480 --> 00:18:42.720]   So it's there out there.
[00:18:42.720 --> 00:18:48.000]   People just need to be informed that if you really, really, this is how cruel it gets.
[00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:53.640]   You can say, well, if you really, you just made a really great angry argument about wanting
[00:18:53.640 --> 00:18:56.040]   a phone with a two and a half inch screen.
[00:18:56.040 --> 00:18:57.040]   Here is one.
[00:18:57.040 --> 00:19:00.240]   It runs an version of Android that's two years old.
[00:19:00.240 --> 00:19:05.280]   It's not made to the fit and function that you expect from from Apple or for Samsung
[00:19:05.280 --> 00:19:06.960]   or from Google.
[00:19:06.960 --> 00:19:11.400]   And you have to wait a month for it to arrive from straight from Hong Kong.
[00:19:11.400 --> 00:19:12.880]   Do you really want it now?
[00:19:12.880 --> 00:19:14.720]   I can beat your candy bar phone.
[00:19:14.720 --> 00:19:15.720]   I bought this.
[00:19:15.720 --> 00:19:18.640]   I don't know why.
[00:19:18.640 --> 00:19:20.960]   This is a duplicate of the gorgeous thing.
[00:19:20.960 --> 00:19:21.960]   That's why.
[00:19:21.960 --> 00:19:22.960]   It's so cute.
[00:19:22.960 --> 00:19:24.520]   I just think it's the cutest thing ever.
[00:19:24.520 --> 00:19:26.200]   That's the phone Deadpool would use.
[00:19:26.200 --> 00:19:31.880]   It's the L8 Star BM10 world smallest phone two and one mini phone on lock GSM with hands
[00:19:31.880 --> 00:19:35.280]   free Bluetooth, dialer Bluetooth, headphone, dual SIM card and a jacket.
[00:19:35.280 --> 00:19:37.000]   Yeah, and it doesn't run Android, but it does.
[00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:38.160]   I think Snake was on it.
[00:19:38.160 --> 00:19:40.320]   I don't know.
[00:19:40.320 --> 00:19:41.320]   Low radiation.
[00:19:41.320 --> 00:19:42.320]   That's an it.
[00:19:42.320 --> 00:19:43.320]   Cute it is.
[00:19:43.320 --> 00:19:44.320]   Isn't it cute?
[00:19:44.320 --> 00:19:46.400]   It's got a removable battery.
[00:19:46.400 --> 00:19:47.400]   I have to say.
[00:19:47.400 --> 00:19:51.960]   Yeah, that's a smugglers phone.
[00:19:51.960 --> 00:19:52.960]   Yeah.
[00:19:52.960 --> 00:19:56.160]   And I think this is kind of my point is this is just.
[00:19:56.160 --> 00:19:58.160]   A phone, a telephone.
[00:19:58.160 --> 00:20:01.160]   You can't really do anything else with it.
[00:20:01.160 --> 00:20:02.400]   There's no data on it.
[00:20:02.400 --> 00:20:05.960]   And that's one of the reasons I think we don't see small phones anymore because if you want
[00:20:05.960 --> 00:20:09.200]   a computer, you do want a bigger screen.
[00:20:09.200 --> 00:20:12.840]   I mean, when you even when you gave that analogy, Andy, of, oh, I want to take a little
[00:20:12.840 --> 00:20:16.600]   or phone out so I can go to the opera, all you can do with that is the you're not going
[00:20:16.600 --> 00:20:18.720]   to post to Instagram or tweet with it.
[00:20:18.720 --> 00:20:19.720]   It's a phone.
[00:20:19.720 --> 00:20:20.720]   Yeah.
[00:20:20.720 --> 00:20:21.720]   No, you're right.
[00:20:21.720 --> 00:20:25.440]   The limiting factor, I think of hardware design isn't so much the keyboard.
[00:20:25.440 --> 00:20:30.840]   I think it's just what is the smallest component you can adequately do Instagram or Facebook
[00:20:30.840 --> 00:20:35.200]   or TikTok or whatever your whatever your generation social media app is.
[00:20:35.200 --> 00:20:40.280]   What's the smallest screen that you can type on and see and actually fit a camera on?
[00:20:40.280 --> 00:20:47.800]   Because that really every phone is I think 75% a just a simply container that you pour
[00:20:47.800 --> 00:20:52.480]   one of three very, very popular multi platform maps into.
[00:20:52.480 --> 00:20:59.840]   So I think also the most important point with the new iPhone SE is the price point.
[00:20:59.840 --> 00:21:03.880]   And in a way, Marcus Brownlee crystallized this with his tweet.
[00:21:03.880 --> 00:21:09.400]   We live in a world where a brand new iPhone is undercutting every single phone one plus
[00:21:09.400 --> 00:21:11.960]   released this year in price.
[00:21:11.960 --> 00:21:19.640]   One plus used to be the whole point of one plus was a flagship phone at a feature phone
[00:21:19.640 --> 00:21:22.440]   price and that's not there.
[00:21:22.440 --> 00:21:24.560]   Then every year we complain they didn't have wireless charging.
[00:21:24.560 --> 00:21:26.600]   We complain exactly right.
[00:21:26.600 --> 00:21:28.480]   And so we added what we complained about it now.
[00:21:28.480 --> 00:21:29.480]   It was too expensive.
[00:21:29.480 --> 00:21:30.480]   Now it's a thousand.
[00:21:30.480 --> 00:21:31.480]   Yeah.
[00:21:31.480 --> 00:21:32.480]   Yeah.
[00:21:32.480 --> 00:21:33.480]   Humans are terrible.
[00:21:33.480 --> 00:21:35.920]   So I'm sure Apple listens to the market.
[00:21:35.920 --> 00:21:40.040]   But again, Apple is in a unique position where they make everything so they can't make
[00:21:40.040 --> 00:21:42.040]   any they can't make everything.
[00:21:42.040 --> 00:21:43.040]   They can make everything.
[00:21:43.040 --> 00:21:44.040]   Yeah.
[00:21:44.040 --> 00:21:47.760]   And they have a kind of a responsibility to listen to the market if there's a significant
[00:21:47.760 --> 00:21:53.280]   plurality that wants a 4.7 inch phone, I think they would have made it right or no.
[00:21:53.280 --> 00:21:55.240]   Well, I think it's.
[00:21:55.240 --> 00:21:56.240]   Yeah, go ahead.
[00:21:56.240 --> 00:21:58.000]   I think it really does.
[00:21:58.000 --> 00:21:59.000]   I'm sorry.
[00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:00.000]   Go ahead, Laurie.
[00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:01.000]   Sorry.
[00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:05.120]   When you say go ahead, you should definitely go ahead.
[00:22:05.120 --> 00:22:09.840]   I think that Apple would have continued making a four inch iPhone if they could have fit the
[00:22:09.840 --> 00:22:12.400]   kind of technological advancements into it.
[00:22:12.400 --> 00:22:15.920]   I think there are enough people who want the four inch iPhone.
[00:22:15.920 --> 00:22:17.040]   They would have brought it back.
[00:22:17.040 --> 00:22:19.080]   They just can't fit everything in there.
[00:22:19.080 --> 00:22:22.680]   And people don't want a less good iPhone.
[00:22:22.680 --> 00:22:26.800]   They want an iPhone that meets today's technological standards.
[00:22:26.800 --> 00:22:29.880]   That's also only four inches and they can't do both.
[00:22:29.880 --> 00:22:33.960]   So that's why we don't I think why we don't have a four inch iPhone today.
[00:22:33.960 --> 00:22:34.960]   Right.
[00:22:34.960 --> 00:22:41.040]   There is some jealousy among the Android users, Android Central, which is an Android fan blog.
[00:22:41.040 --> 00:22:45.240]   The cheapest iPhone kind of a little tear was coming down their cheek when they wrote
[00:22:45.240 --> 00:22:46.240]   this headline.
[00:22:46.240 --> 00:22:53.040]   The cheapest iPhone has a more powerful processor than the most expensive Android phone.
[00:22:53.040 --> 00:22:54.040]   I don't know.
[00:22:54.040 --> 00:22:55.040]   It's very golden brand so much.
[00:22:55.040 --> 00:23:00.560]   I don't know if it's exactly true that the A3-10 bionic is faster than the 865.
[00:23:00.560 --> 00:23:01.560]   Is it?
[00:23:01.560 --> 00:23:02.560]   Yep.
[00:23:02.560 --> 00:23:03.560]   In what way?
[00:23:03.560 --> 00:23:04.560]   In benchmarks.
[00:23:04.560 --> 00:23:06.560]   Well, no, I mean, well, it depends on Qualcomm.
[00:23:06.560 --> 00:23:09.840]   Again, they got caught flat footed by the whole 64 bit thing.
[00:23:09.840 --> 00:23:13.600]   That was years ago, but they're a silicon merchant and they make money off ships.
[00:23:13.600 --> 00:23:14.600]   Apple doesn't.
[00:23:14.600 --> 00:23:17.840]   It would be who's them to keep technologies on the market as long as possible.
[00:23:17.840 --> 00:23:20.520]   It's the same reason Apple is making this in an iPhone 8 body.
[00:23:20.520 --> 00:23:21.840]   That's all paid off.
[00:23:21.840 --> 00:23:24.640]   The more that they can sell that's already paid off, the higher their profit margins
[00:23:24.640 --> 00:23:25.640]   go.
[00:23:25.640 --> 00:23:29.760]   So they would have let 32 bit ride for a couple more years still and they've been forced to
[00:23:29.760 --> 00:23:32.400]   catch up and then suddenly there's a neural engine and then suddenly there's all these
[00:23:32.400 --> 00:23:34.280]   accelerators and they're doing well.
[00:23:34.280 --> 00:23:35.840]   They're beginning to catch up.
[00:23:35.840 --> 00:23:41.000]   But in terms of just single core performance and sheer rendering power, Apple's hitting
[00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:44.720]   levels, I think they're going to be still two years.
[00:23:44.720 --> 00:23:47.320]   And again, it takes a lot of money.
[00:23:47.320 --> 00:23:48.320]   Apple's got iPhone money.
[00:23:48.320 --> 00:23:50.640]   It takes a lot of money to build out silicon like that.
[00:23:50.640 --> 00:23:53.920]   It's why they don't make watch silicon anymore because they literally can't they would like
[00:23:53.920 --> 00:23:57.200]   to, but they literally can't afford to do it because they don't have an Apple Watch style
[00:23:57.200 --> 00:23:58.680]   product funding it.
[00:23:58.680 --> 00:24:00.760]   Do you have an 865 based phone?
[00:24:00.760 --> 00:24:01.760]   Because I'm curious.
[00:24:01.760 --> 00:24:03.960]   I have the full four which I think is last year's.
[00:24:03.960 --> 00:24:04.960]   Yeah, it's not a 60s.
[00:24:04.960 --> 00:24:05.960]   Yeah.
[00:24:05.960 --> 00:24:07.040]   It's a 855.
[00:24:07.040 --> 00:24:08.880]   So that's my question.
[00:24:08.880 --> 00:24:10.320]   Is it really slower?
[00:24:10.320 --> 00:24:15.320]   And by the way, a lot of I don't think the Pixel 5 will the rumors are will not be using
[00:24:15.320 --> 00:24:16.920]   the 865 because it's too expensive.
[00:24:16.920 --> 00:24:18.280]   It's different choices, right?
[00:24:18.280 --> 00:24:22.280]   Like the choices Google and Apple makes are so they off they chose the best camera, but
[00:24:22.280 --> 00:24:23.280]   not the best processor.
[00:24:23.280 --> 00:24:26.480]   Apple chose the best processor, but not the best camera.
[00:24:26.480 --> 00:24:28.040]   It's just I find it fascinating.
[00:24:28.040 --> 00:24:29.040]   Yeah.
[00:24:29.040 --> 00:24:31.160]   Well, that's always part of the trade off.
[00:24:31.160 --> 00:24:36.080]   I don't know if it's fair though to say, oh, this I mean, I don't look at the.
[00:24:36.080 --> 00:24:37.080]   I trust an Antec.
[00:24:37.080 --> 00:24:38.960]   An Antec does things to chips that are almost unholy.
[00:24:38.960 --> 00:24:40.920]   But a lot of it's benchmarking, right?
[00:24:40.920 --> 00:24:41.920]   It's not.
[00:24:41.920 --> 00:24:44.560]   But it's not an Antec benchmarking is not just like downloading and running Geekbench,
[00:24:44.560 --> 00:24:48.120]   just like putting it through every test conceivable by man or demon.
[00:24:48.120 --> 00:24:52.000]   And you know, and like Andre and Antec will tell you what he what those things are capable
[00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:53.000]   of.
[00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:56.280]   And it's also like, when you put into apps, like there's apps like LumaFusion and things
[00:24:56.280 --> 00:25:00.240]   or the people who make the dual, I forget the multi camera thing.
[00:25:00.240 --> 00:25:03.320]   And they'll just let out tell you that they can't make the same kind of apps.
[00:25:03.320 --> 00:25:06.320]   So that's a direct correlation to what you can pull out of this.
[00:25:06.320 --> 00:25:07.320]   So like pro.
[00:25:07.320 --> 00:25:08.320]   Yeah.
[00:25:08.320 --> 00:25:11.440]   We are talking about really high end stuff though.
[00:25:11.440 --> 00:25:15.840]   It comes down to like what's the day to day operations that you're going to come through
[00:25:15.840 --> 00:25:17.900]   with on a device.
[00:25:17.900 --> 00:25:20.600]   And as we've been saying all the time, it really is about trade offs.
[00:25:20.600 --> 00:25:23.240]   How much bang for the buck can you actually deliver?
[00:25:23.240 --> 00:25:27.980]   How much of the engineering that you put into this device are the consumers really going
[00:25:27.980 --> 00:25:29.240]   to notice?
[00:25:29.240 --> 00:25:33.600]   And that's why when the things that really impress me the most about the new iPhone is
[00:25:33.600 --> 00:25:38.800]   such a smart set of choices that the one that they are there are only two things that are
[00:25:38.800 --> 00:25:39.800]   non negotiable.
[00:25:39.800 --> 00:25:42.560]   I was sorry, let's say the three things that are non negotiable.
[00:25:42.560 --> 00:25:45.240]   You have to have a screen of a certain size.
[00:25:45.240 --> 00:25:49.440]   You have to have biometric biometric unlocking at this point.
[00:25:49.440 --> 00:25:54.400]   And you have to have you have to maximize the processing power of the platform because
[00:25:54.400 --> 00:26:01.000]   otherwise you really are going to create two different classes of citizens for the app
[00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:02.000]   store.
[00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:07.360]   You can run that really cool version of animal crossing or that really cool AR game that
[00:26:07.360 --> 00:26:12.400]   all your friends are playing and the people who kind of really can't run it because it
[00:26:12.400 --> 00:26:15.520]   will either kill the battery or they won't get the same sort of performance that will
[00:26:15.520 --> 00:26:16.520]   end everything else.
[00:26:16.520 --> 00:26:17.520]   So they sacrificed.
[00:26:17.520 --> 00:26:20.680]   They said that we're not going to have the highest tech screen.
[00:26:20.680 --> 00:26:24.640]   We're going to drop back to an actual manual, an actual manual clicky button for the home
[00:26:24.640 --> 00:26:25.640]   screen.
[00:26:25.640 --> 00:26:31.080]   We're going to try to do as many tricks with an old camera as we can with the new processor.
[00:26:31.080 --> 00:26:35.920]   But we are not going to compromise on the speed and the actual interaction with this
[00:26:35.920 --> 00:26:36.920]   device.
[00:26:36.920 --> 00:26:38.800]   That's the one thing you really can't engineer around.
[00:26:38.800 --> 00:26:44.640]   If the scrolling is slow, if the thing locks up because some web page even on a mobile
[00:26:44.640 --> 00:26:47.240]   browser is acting frisky.
[00:26:47.240 --> 00:26:51.480]   And if you can't run whatever app you're promoting in the keynote, whatever app you're promoting
[00:26:51.480 --> 00:26:56.120]   in those wonderful YouTube commercials, then you're not delivering that kind of value.
[00:26:56.120 --> 00:26:58.160]   This is a hell of a phone for $400.
[00:26:58.160 --> 00:26:59.160]   Yeah.
[00:26:59.160 --> 00:27:00.560]   I mean, there's no, I'm not questioning that.
[00:27:00.560 --> 00:27:01.800]   Oh, no, of course.
[00:27:01.800 --> 00:27:02.800]   But I don't know.
[00:27:02.800 --> 00:27:07.560]   I mean, look, the snap over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over
[00:27:07.560 --> 00:27:08.560]   and over and over and over and over and over.
[00:27:08.560 --> 00:27:13.840]   And I don't think there's an iPhone that can do that or an iPad that can do that.
[00:27:13.840 --> 00:27:17.160]   So unless there's none that are enabled today, DHH had a really good tweet to where he was
[00:27:17.160 --> 00:27:22.000]   running, you know, he's the Ruby on Rails guy where he was running just bench of web
[00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:23.000]   rendering.
[00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:25.280]   It was like 300 times ridiculous times faster.
[00:27:25.280 --> 00:27:26.640]   But again, like your point, no one's going to use that.
[00:27:26.640 --> 00:27:28.880]   No one puts their car in red line every day.
[00:27:28.880 --> 00:27:29.880]   Yeah.
[00:27:29.880 --> 00:27:32.560]   And then the other thing that I've done is I've done a lot of things.
[00:27:32.560 --> 00:27:33.560]   And I've done a lot of things.
[00:27:33.560 --> 00:27:34.560]   I've done a lot of things.
[00:27:34.560 --> 00:27:35.560]   I've done a lot of things.
[00:27:35.560 --> 00:27:36.560]   I've done a lot of things.
[00:27:36.560 --> 00:27:37.560]   I've done a lot of things.
[00:27:37.560 --> 00:27:38.560]   I've done a lot of things.
[00:27:38.560 --> 00:27:39.560]   I've done a lot of things.
[00:27:39.560 --> 00:27:40.560]   I've done a lot of things.
[00:27:40.560 --> 00:27:41.560]   I've done a lot of things.
[00:27:41.560 --> 00:27:42.560]   I've done a lot of things.
[00:27:42.560 --> 00:27:43.560]   I've done a lot of things.
[00:27:43.560 --> 00:27:44.560]   I've done a lot of things.
[00:27:44.560 --> 00:27:45.560]   I've done a lot of things.
[00:27:45.560 --> 00:27:46.560]   I've done a lot of things.
[00:27:46.560 --> 00:27:47.560]   I've done a lot of things.
[00:27:47.560 --> 00:27:48.560]   I've done a lot of things.
[00:27:48.560 --> 00:27:49.560]   I've done a lot of things.
[00:27:49.560 --> 00:27:50.560]   I've done a lot of things.
[00:27:50.560 --> 00:27:51.560]   I've done a lot of things.
[00:27:51.560 --> 00:28:17.080]   I've done a lot of things.
[00:28:17.080 --> 00:28:42.600]   I've done a lot of things.
[00:28:42.600 --> 00:29:08.120]   I've done a lot of things.
[00:29:08.120 --> 00:29:33.640]   I've done a lot of things.
[00:29:33.640 --> 00:29:59.160]   I've done a lot of things.
[00:29:59.160 --> 00:30:10.280]   I've done a lot of things.
[00:30:10.280 --> 00:30:17.720]   I've done a lot of things.
[00:30:17.720 --> 00:30:24.160]   I've done a lot of things.
[00:30:24.160 --> 00:30:31.160]   I've done a lot of things.
[00:30:31.160 --> 00:30:31.160]   I've done a lot of things.
[00:30:31.160 --> 00:30:32.160]   I've done a lot of things.
[00:30:32.160 --> 00:30:33.160]   I've done a lot of things.
[00:30:33.160 --> 00:30:34.160]   I've done a lot of things.
[00:30:34.160 --> 00:30:35.160]   I've done a lot of things.
[00:30:35.160 --> 00:30:36.160]   I've done a lot of things.
[00:30:36.160 --> 00:30:37.160]   I've done a lot of things.
[00:30:37.160 --> 00:30:38.160]   I've done a lot of things.
[00:30:38.160 --> 00:30:39.160]   I've done a lot of things.
[00:30:39.160 --> 00:30:40.160]   I've done a lot of things.
[00:30:40.160 --> 00:30:41.160]   I've done a lot of things.
[00:30:41.160 --> 00:30:42.160]   I've done a lot of things.
[00:30:42.160 --> 00:30:43.160]   I've done a lot of things.
[00:30:43.160 --> 00:30:44.160]   I've done a lot of things.
[00:30:44.160 --> 00:30:45.160]   I've done a lot of things.
[00:30:45.160 --> 00:30:46.160]   I've done a lot of things.
[00:30:46.160 --> 00:30:47.160]   I've done a lot of things.
[00:30:47.160 --> 00:30:48.160]   I've done a lot of things.
[00:30:48.160 --> 00:30:49.160]   I've done a lot of things.
[00:30:49.160 --> 00:30:50.160]   I've done a lot of things.
[00:30:50.160 --> 00:30:51.160]   I've done a lot of things.
[00:30:51.160 --> 00:30:52.160]   I recommend anybody who asks me.
[00:30:52.160 --> 00:30:53.160]   I want to get an iPhone.
[00:30:53.160 --> 00:30:55.160]   I'll say, "We'll start with the SE."
[00:30:55.160 --> 00:30:56.160]   Yeah.
[00:30:56.160 --> 00:30:57.160]   You start with the SE.
[00:30:57.160 --> 00:31:00.160]   It's not that you necessarily buy it outright,
[00:31:00.160 --> 00:31:04.160]   but you start by looking at it and try to come up with an argument
[00:31:04.160 --> 00:31:07.160]   about why you should spend an extra two or three hundred dollars.
[00:31:07.160 --> 00:31:08.160]   Because this isn't the budget phone.
[00:31:08.160 --> 00:31:11.160]   This is simply, this is more accurately an entry-level phone.
[00:31:11.160 --> 00:31:13.160]   I'm sorry, Lori.
[00:31:13.160 --> 00:31:16.160]   We were running heads like Chip and Dale.
[00:31:16.160 --> 00:31:17.160]   Like, "No, no, after you.
[00:31:17.160 --> 00:31:18.160]   No, no, after you."
[00:31:18.160 --> 00:31:23.760]   But what I was going to say then is just that this, if nothing can underscore how important
[00:31:23.760 --> 00:31:29.620]   price point is in 2020 and selling phones, the fact that Apple did what they had to do
[00:31:29.620 --> 00:31:34.760]   to produce a really competitive four hundred dollar phone, that shows you in the domestic
[00:31:34.760 --> 00:31:40.440]   market and the world market, people are the sophistication of the base level phone is
[00:31:40.440 --> 00:31:42.040]   now at such a high level.
[00:31:42.040 --> 00:31:47.800]   It's right about where people want a phone to be and so it's harder to convince people
[00:31:47.800 --> 00:31:52.400]   of how wonderful your company is as a team of engineers and marketers with a fourteen
[00:31:52.400 --> 00:32:00.520]   hundred dollar phone than what you can do by offering them a four hundred dollar phone.
[00:32:00.520 --> 00:32:07.240]   So John Prosser, who was very accurate in his SE, had a tweet yesterday that floored
[00:32:07.240 --> 00:32:08.240]   me.
[00:32:08.240 --> 00:32:10.440]   But we're not going to talk about John Prosser.
[00:32:10.440 --> 00:32:11.600]   We're not going to talk about that.
[00:32:11.600 --> 00:32:13.640]   It's called the tease.
[00:32:13.640 --> 00:32:15.040]   I hope it teased you.
[00:32:15.040 --> 00:32:16.880]   I hope you enjoy being teased.
[00:32:16.880 --> 00:32:17.880]   Stay tuned.
[00:32:17.880 --> 00:32:18.880]   We'll talk about that next.
[00:32:18.880 --> 00:32:19.880]   I'm riveted Lee.
[00:32:19.880 --> 00:32:20.880]   I'm not going anywhere.
[00:32:20.880 --> 00:32:21.880]   You know it.
[00:32:21.880 --> 00:32:22.880]   You know what he tweeted.
[00:32:22.880 --> 00:32:23.880]   I know.
[00:32:23.880 --> 00:32:24.880]   There's so many.
[00:32:24.880 --> 00:32:25.880]   I'm winning.
[00:32:25.880 --> 00:32:26.880]   Oh, okay.
[00:32:26.880 --> 00:32:27.880]   Which one did Leo like?
[00:32:27.880 --> 00:32:29.760]   Laurie Gillis here is great to have you.
[00:32:29.760 --> 00:32:30.760]   Laurie, we missed you last week.
[00:32:30.760 --> 00:32:31.760]   It's wonderful.
[00:32:31.760 --> 00:32:32.760]   Alex, we're going to try.
[00:32:32.760 --> 00:32:34.880]   I can't do four people.
[00:32:34.880 --> 00:32:36.720]   So we're going to try rotating the hosts.
[00:32:36.720 --> 00:32:40.160]   When Alex Lindsey can't be here, Laurie must be here and so on.
[00:32:40.160 --> 00:32:42.160]   I'm sorry about last weekend.
[00:32:42.160 --> 00:32:43.160]   Gladly.
[00:32:43.160 --> 00:32:44.160]   I was a kid on the old Vista Cruiser.
[00:32:44.160 --> 00:32:45.160]   You can't fit him in.
[00:32:45.160 --> 00:32:48.800]   You see, there's no room in the studio for all these people.
[00:32:48.800 --> 00:32:49.800]   Oh, squeeze time.
[00:32:49.800 --> 00:32:51.800]   What if I just sort of start you down?
[00:32:51.800 --> 00:32:52.800]   Social distancing.
[00:32:52.800 --> 00:32:53.800]   Social distancing.
[00:32:53.800 --> 00:32:54.800]   Oh.
[00:32:54.800 --> 00:32:56.600]   See, I'm barely taking up a third of the screen now.
[00:32:56.600 --> 00:32:59.840]   Andy will partition Andy's screen.
[00:32:59.840 --> 00:33:01.040]   Andy and I go all the way.
[00:33:01.040 --> 00:33:03.720]   I'll just raise my hand whenever I want to.
[00:33:03.720 --> 00:33:05.680]   Yeah, that's really more of the issue.
[00:33:05.680 --> 00:33:07.400]   It's not the screen size.
[00:33:07.400 --> 00:33:09.440]   It's the opinion size.
[00:33:09.440 --> 00:33:12.160]   We're all, we all got to get our word in the edge.
[00:33:12.160 --> 00:33:13.160]   We got big opinions.
[00:33:13.160 --> 00:33:14.160]   We got big opinions.
[00:33:14.160 --> 00:33:15.160]   Yeah, can you?
[00:33:15.160 --> 00:33:18.680]   As many listeners have said, my opinions are like a gas.
[00:33:18.680 --> 00:33:20.440]   It does expand to fill a bit of a container.
[00:33:20.440 --> 00:33:21.440]   It's allowed to release.
[00:33:21.440 --> 00:33:24.800]   That's why we love you, Andrew.
[00:33:24.800 --> 00:33:27.480]   And Renee Richie, how's the new YouTube going?
[00:33:27.480 --> 00:33:28.480]   Is it going well?
[00:33:28.480 --> 00:33:30.440]   Yeah, it's going really well.
[00:33:30.440 --> 00:33:34.480]   I mean, I just, I'm so thankful that people are still, they didn't use this as an excuse
[00:33:34.480 --> 00:33:36.400]   to just go, oh, that guy had enough am.
[00:33:36.400 --> 00:33:37.400]   Bye.
[00:33:37.400 --> 00:33:38.400]   Go out and subscribe.
[00:33:38.400 --> 00:33:41.000]   Because it is great.
[00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:42.640]   YouTube.com/ReneeRitchie.
[00:33:42.640 --> 00:33:45.200]   He's doing good stuff.
[00:33:45.200 --> 00:33:46.200]   And I'm thrilled.
[00:33:46.200 --> 00:33:47.200]   I was a little worried.
[00:33:47.200 --> 00:33:50.640]   I don't know about you, but I was a little worried Apple might not call you and offer
[00:33:50.640 --> 00:33:53.800]   you those briefings when you're not working for iMOR.
[00:33:53.800 --> 00:33:55.800]   But no, you're still on the brink of trying to.
[00:33:55.800 --> 00:33:57.560]   Well, see, like I said, I didn't get the magic keyboards.
[00:33:57.560 --> 00:33:58.720]   You can never take anything for granted.
[00:33:58.720 --> 00:33:59.720]   Oh, yeah.
[00:33:59.720 --> 00:34:00.960]   I want to talk about the magic keyboard too.
[00:34:00.960 --> 00:34:02.600]   We'll do that next.
[00:34:02.600 --> 00:34:04.480]   First, I'll worry about my mattress.
[00:34:04.480 --> 00:34:10.520]   Everything nowadays is taken an outside, disproportionate part of my life.
[00:34:10.520 --> 00:34:12.680]   Have you noticed that?
[00:34:12.680 --> 00:34:16.000]   We spent a lot of time in bed, maybe more than ever before.
[00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:21.520]   Thank goodness for the Casper, the best mattress you'll ever have.
[00:34:21.520 --> 00:34:24.800]   Here I am opening my brand new Casper.
[00:34:24.800 --> 00:34:28.720]   I've had many of the different Caspers over the years.
[00:34:28.720 --> 00:34:35.320]   And I got to tell you, in every case, what makes Casper special is they are obsessively,
[00:34:35.320 --> 00:34:40.960]   obsessively engineered products, just beautifully done.
[00:34:40.960 --> 00:34:47.200]   Their mattress is designed to do something almost seemingly incompatible.
[00:34:47.200 --> 00:34:53.160]   They have just the right sink and the just right bounce to give you a perfect night's
[00:34:53.160 --> 00:34:54.160]   sleep.
[00:34:54.160 --> 00:34:58.560]   Now, one of the problems people say, well, one of the advantages of Casper, because they
[00:34:58.560 --> 00:35:06.640]   don't go in those big mattress stores where the markup is 100%, you're buying direct from
[00:35:06.640 --> 00:35:07.640]   the factory.
[00:35:07.640 --> 00:35:11.600]   You save a lot with a Casper, but sometimes people say, well, wait a minute, I want to
[00:35:11.600 --> 00:35:12.720]   sleep on it.
[00:35:12.720 --> 00:35:14.120]   How do I try before I buy?
[00:35:14.120 --> 00:35:17.400]   Well, you actually literally get to sleep on something you never got to do in a mattress
[00:35:17.400 --> 00:35:21.400]   store for 100 nights.
[00:35:21.400 --> 00:35:26.480]   Painless returns to the US and Canada anytime in the first 100 nights in your every penny
[00:35:26.480 --> 00:35:28.120]   will be refunded to you.
[00:35:28.120 --> 00:35:32.920]   I don't think I've never given back a Casper mattress and I've owned many of them.
[00:35:32.920 --> 00:35:36.800]   The original Casper, that's the first one I had, combines multiple supportive memory
[00:35:36.800 --> 00:35:41.160]   foams for a quality sleep surface with the right amount of sink and bounce.
[00:35:41.160 --> 00:35:42.160]   It's breathable.
[00:35:42.160 --> 00:35:46.960]   I should really mention that because sleeping cool at night is a big part of sleeping well.
[00:35:46.960 --> 00:35:50.560]   When you're too hot or too cold, that's not good.
[00:35:50.560 --> 00:35:54.000]   The Casper helps you regulate your body temperature throughout the night, so you're perfectly
[00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:55.000]   comfortable.
[00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:59.920]   20,000 reviews now of the original Casper with an average of 4.8 stars.
[00:35:59.920 --> 00:36:02.560]   That's on Casper, Amazon and Google reviews.
[00:36:02.560 --> 00:36:05.160]   It is rapidly becoming the internet's favorite mattress.
[00:36:05.160 --> 00:36:06.920]   It's been mine for a long time.
[00:36:06.920 --> 00:36:09.600]   There are three other mattresses besides the original Casper.
[00:36:09.600 --> 00:36:14.400]   The wave that features a patent pending premium support system to mirror the natural
[00:36:14.400 --> 00:36:15.960]   shape of your body.
[00:36:15.960 --> 00:36:17.000]   Then there's the essential.
[00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:22.800]   This is one that I would send to a college kit, for instance, off to school because it
[00:36:22.800 --> 00:36:25.400]   has a streamlined design at a price that won't keep you up at night.
[00:36:25.400 --> 00:36:29.000]   One of the things I love about all the Casper mattresses, they come in those surprisingly
[00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:30.000]   compact boxes.
[00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:33.400]   They're very easy to move in.
[00:36:33.400 --> 00:36:36.880]   Good news, if you do decide to return it, you don't have to put it back in the box.
[00:36:36.880 --> 00:36:38.680]   I'll come again as it is.
[00:36:38.680 --> 00:36:41.880]   They have some special box stuffing equipment, I guess.
[00:36:41.880 --> 00:36:45.200]   The hybrid, which is the one you saw me open, I love that one.
[00:36:45.200 --> 00:36:50.200]   It combines the pressure relief of the award-winning foam mattresses with a durable yet gentle
[00:36:50.200 --> 00:36:52.880]   spring so they give you a firmer edge.
[00:36:52.880 --> 00:36:53.880]   It makes it easier for me.
[00:36:53.880 --> 00:36:56.480]   I'm a big guy getting out of bed in the morning.
[00:36:56.480 --> 00:36:58.040]   I just get a great night's sleep.
[00:36:58.040 --> 00:37:00.400]   What's nice is Lisa likes a really soft mattress.
[00:37:00.400 --> 00:37:01.560]   I like a firm one.
[00:37:01.560 --> 00:37:04.640]   The Casper satisfies us both.
[00:37:04.640 --> 00:37:06.200]   There's a lot to be said for that.
[00:37:06.200 --> 00:37:08.200]   I also love my Casper pillow.
[00:37:08.200 --> 00:37:09.360]   Casper has a whole man.
[00:37:09.360 --> 00:37:10.840]   I love my Casper pillow.
[00:37:10.840 --> 00:37:15.660]   Casper offers a wide array of other products, pillows, sheets, even that beautiful glow
[00:37:15.660 --> 00:37:19.920]   light to ensure an overall better sleep experience.
[00:37:19.920 --> 00:37:25.200]   Again, you can be sure of your purchase with Casper's 100-night risk-free sleep on a trial.
[00:37:25.200 --> 00:37:29.440]   Casper offers free shipping and painless returns in the US and Canada.
[00:37:29.440 --> 00:37:32.720]   Right now we've got $100 towards select mattresses off.
[00:37:32.720 --> 00:37:37.120]   All you got to do is go to Casper.com/MacBreak and use the offer code MacBreak at checkout
[00:37:37.120 --> 00:37:38.760]   terms and conditions apply.

[00:37:49.560 --> 00:37:50.560]   Thank you Casper.
[00:37:50.560 --> 00:37:51.760]   Thank you.
[00:37:51.760 --> 00:37:58.120]   I think there's no silver lining to COVID, but if you think about it, people don't want
[00:37:58.120 --> 00:38:00.920]   to go to a mattress store anymore, right?
[00:38:00.920 --> 00:38:04.720]   This is a mattress that's just delivered to you and they'll come and get it if you don't
[00:38:04.720 --> 00:38:05.720]   like it.
[00:38:05.720 --> 00:38:07.760]   This is the way to get a mattress.
[00:38:07.760 --> 00:38:13.160]   Even if we're sheltering at home, especially if we're sheltering at home, you need a good
[00:38:13.160 --> 00:38:14.160]   mattress.
[00:38:14.160 --> 00:38:18.360]   Maybe you've got a few more visitors in your home than you need a good mattress.
[00:38:18.360 --> 00:38:20.760]   Casper.com/MacBreak.
[00:38:20.760 --> 00:38:23.520]   All right, let me do the keyboard.
[00:38:23.520 --> 00:38:26.040]   Then I'll do John Prosser's tweet.
[00:38:26.040 --> 00:38:27.040]   Have you...
[00:38:27.040 --> 00:38:28.040]   Hasn't he been waiting?
[00:38:28.040 --> 00:38:29.560]   You know what he said.
[00:38:29.560 --> 00:38:30.560]   Maybe you don't.
[00:38:30.560 --> 00:38:32.840]   I've seen a couple of big things.
[00:38:32.840 --> 00:38:33.840]   Yeah.
[00:38:33.840 --> 00:38:35.840]   I'm pretty sure I know we're talking about it.
[00:38:35.840 --> 00:38:39.560]   Well, there's one that just blew me away, but first the keyboard, anything to say about
[00:38:39.560 --> 00:38:41.120]   none of you have it yet, right?
[00:38:41.120 --> 00:38:42.120]   Not yet.
[00:38:42.120 --> 00:38:43.120]   No idea.
[00:38:43.120 --> 00:38:44.120]   I get mine Friday.
[00:38:44.120 --> 00:38:45.720]   I think mine's coming Friday as well.
[00:38:45.720 --> 00:38:48.320]   I've been smoked as I'm sure you did at the price a little bit.
[00:38:48.320 --> 00:38:49.320]   Yeah, a little bit.
[00:38:49.320 --> 00:38:50.320]   A little bit.
[00:38:50.320 --> 00:38:56.200]   Nevertheless, I love my iPad Pro so much, and I feel like...
[00:38:56.200 --> 00:39:02.640]   I said this when it came out, this is amazing hardware, just waiting for the right software.
[00:39:02.640 --> 00:39:07.800]   A big step forward is getting a trackpad, getting a real keyboard.
[00:39:07.800 --> 00:39:10.080]   I mean the smart keyboard, come on, let's face it.
[00:39:10.080 --> 00:39:11.080]   No backlighting.
[00:39:11.080 --> 00:39:12.520]   It's not real keys.
[00:39:12.520 --> 00:39:13.520]   It's...
[00:39:13.520 --> 00:39:14.520]   But it is waterproof, Leo.
[00:39:14.520 --> 00:39:15.520]   I don't care.
[00:39:15.520 --> 00:39:18.320]   I'm gonna swim with a damn thing.
[00:39:18.320 --> 00:39:23.160]   So I feel like I had to get the magic keyboard because that's what's gonna at least physically
[00:39:23.160 --> 00:39:25.040]   turn this into a real laptop.
[00:39:25.040 --> 00:39:32.080]   Now, here's John Pross's tweet, which maybe means even more in the long run in the scale
[00:39:32.080 --> 00:39:33.680]   of things.
[00:39:33.680 --> 00:39:37.800]   Xcode, that's the one, okay?
[00:39:37.800 --> 00:39:39.920]   I gave it away.
[00:39:39.920 --> 00:39:43.280]   He tweeted, "I'm not gonna say the final cut is coming to iPad."
[00:39:43.280 --> 00:39:48.840]   So by the way, the fact that he said, "I'm not gonna say that makes me think it is."
[00:39:48.840 --> 00:39:49.840]   Right?
[00:39:49.840 --> 00:39:51.520]   I mean, why else would you even say that?
[00:39:51.520 --> 00:39:55.600]   Well, this is the equivalent of moving the chess piece, but keeping your finger on it
[00:39:55.600 --> 00:39:57.600]   while you look around the board, but okay.
[00:39:57.600 --> 00:40:00.160]   Oh, you're thinking it's a touch move, huh?
[00:40:00.160 --> 00:40:01.160]   All right.
[00:40:01.160 --> 00:40:02.160]   I'm not gonna...
[00:40:02.160 --> 00:40:07.040]   I'm not gonna say the final cut is coming to iPad, but I think that means he thinks it
[00:40:07.040 --> 00:40:08.040]   is.
[00:40:08.040 --> 00:40:09.040]   Whoops, I scrolled down.
[00:40:09.040 --> 00:40:18.960]   Xcode, Xcode, Apple's very nice, very sophisticated, very thorough development platform for Mac OS
[00:40:18.960 --> 00:40:20.480]   and iOS.
[00:40:20.480 --> 00:40:25.960]   Is present on iOS iPad OS 14?
[00:40:25.960 --> 00:40:27.480]   The implications there are huge.
[00:40:27.480 --> 00:40:30.920]   It opens the door for pro applications to come to the iPad.
[00:40:30.920 --> 00:40:34.400]   I mentioned this last week on a livestream, but figured it was worth the tweet.
[00:40:34.400 --> 00:40:35.400]   Now there's a couple...
[00:40:35.400 --> 00:40:38.560]   I want to take this part a little bit, because he says iOS and iPad OS.
[00:40:38.560 --> 00:40:44.520]   I can't imagine developing code on an iPhone.
[00:40:44.520 --> 00:40:46.520]   So I wonder what he means by that.
[00:40:46.520 --> 00:40:49.520]   Well, but on an iPad, that is a big deal.
[00:40:49.520 --> 00:40:50.520]   iPad's huge.
[00:40:50.520 --> 00:40:51.520]   Yeah.
[00:40:51.520 --> 00:40:58.120]   I mean, the people who use iPads and Chromebooks for web development, that is an underappreciated
[00:40:58.120 --> 00:40:59.120]   part of the market.
[00:40:59.120 --> 00:41:01.120]   It is surprising.
[00:41:01.120 --> 00:41:07.400]   All these like, "Hey, I am Neo, Ninja Coder, and you're running something that's so simple,
[00:41:07.400 --> 00:41:09.680]   but it is so simple and accessible."
[00:41:09.680 --> 00:41:16.960]   Also the ability to execute something not just in an emulator, but in the actual device,
[00:41:16.960 --> 00:41:22.560]   particularly a device like the iPad where it's not a keyboard, mouse, screen, metaphor.
[00:41:22.560 --> 00:41:25.720]   It really is, hold this thing in your hand.
[00:41:25.720 --> 00:41:29.880]   Figure out how much of a pain of a butt is it to swing your arm from one place of the
[00:41:29.880 --> 00:41:31.600]   screen to the other.
[00:41:31.600 --> 00:41:37.200]   But also just the idea of Apple creating a unified coding environment where if you learn
[00:41:37.200 --> 00:41:40.240]   this one environment, you can build apps for everything.
[00:41:40.240 --> 00:41:43.440]   It really is the other shoe that's been waiting to drop for years.
[00:41:43.440 --> 00:41:48.360]   And as soon as you mentioned Prosser's tweet, I was not thinking hardware.
[00:41:48.360 --> 00:41:53.240]   I was thinking, "Yeah, that got my nostrils flaring as soon as I read that because he
[00:41:53.240 --> 00:41:54.240]   is a very good source."
[00:41:54.240 --> 00:41:55.240]   It's huge.
[00:41:55.240 --> 00:41:57.800]   He's been exactly right on iPhone SE.
[00:41:57.800 --> 00:41:59.320]   He's kind of the newest.
[00:41:59.320 --> 00:42:01.120]   Who is he, by the way?
[00:42:01.120 --> 00:42:03.080]   He's a YouTuber, right?
[00:42:03.080 --> 00:42:04.680]   He was a YouTuber for about 10 years.
[00:42:04.680 --> 00:42:09.120]   He's been doing a daily tech show where he would mostly just recap the news in a funny
[00:42:09.120 --> 00:42:11.080]   sort of a character way.
[00:42:11.080 --> 00:42:13.880]   He would just make fun of it so that it was an entertaining way to catch up on the tech
[00:42:13.880 --> 00:42:14.880]   news.
[00:42:14.880 --> 00:42:18.920]   And then he started getting Samsung and Google Pixel leaks over the last few years.
[00:42:18.920 --> 00:42:22.640]   He had a couple of really, really good ones about the Pixel 4, I think the Pixel 3 as
[00:42:22.640 --> 00:42:24.640]   well, and some of the Samsung stuff.
[00:42:24.640 --> 00:42:28.880]   And then a few months ago he started getting really good Apple leaks.
[00:42:28.880 --> 00:42:35.480]   So given everything, the last few leaks he's been right on, including, by the way, even
[00:42:35.480 --> 00:42:37.560]   the very data, it sounds like he's got somebody in the time.
[00:42:37.560 --> 00:42:38.560]   And the time.
[00:42:38.560 --> 00:42:39.560]   He tweeted the time out.
[00:42:39.560 --> 00:42:40.560]   The time.
[00:42:40.560 --> 00:42:41.560]   Wow, obviously.
[00:42:41.560 --> 00:42:42.560]   Yeah.
[00:42:42.560 --> 00:42:44.480]   So he's got somebody on the inside clearly.
[00:42:44.480 --> 00:42:45.880]   This is really interesting.
[00:42:45.880 --> 00:42:51.120]   If Apple comes out with Xcode, that means you will no longer need a Mac to develop.
[00:42:51.120 --> 00:42:55.720]   My understanding is that this has been in the works for a while and that it's a similar
[00:42:55.720 --> 00:43:00.000]   thing to what Adobe's been doing with Photoshop, but where Adobe's willing to do it in public,
[00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:01.000]   Apple is not.
[00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:04.960]   And there's a bit of a shame to that because I think it's useful what Adobe, the process
[00:43:04.960 --> 00:43:08.920]   Adobe's going through with Photoshop, where they know they're bringing real Photoshop
[00:43:08.920 --> 00:43:13.080]   and that it's the real underlying code of Photoshop, but not full Photoshop because there's
[00:43:13.080 --> 00:43:15.360]   just so much in Photoshop.
[00:43:15.360 --> 00:43:18.640]   And they're trying to figure out with their users what the functionality that best suits
[00:43:18.640 --> 00:43:19.800]   the iPad is.
[00:43:19.800 --> 00:43:24.920]   And I think Apple has a similar thing with Xcode in that my understanding is that you're
[00:43:24.920 --> 00:43:29.400]   not going to just have like, this is Xcode for iPad and it does exactly what Xcode for
[00:43:29.400 --> 00:43:30.400]   the Mac.
[00:43:30.400 --> 00:43:32.640]   Yeah, I wouldn't expect that any more than a set of things.
[00:43:32.640 --> 00:43:34.840]   Final cut would be, you know, a full final cut.
[00:43:34.840 --> 00:43:35.840]   So final cut is worse.
[00:43:35.840 --> 00:43:36.840]   Final cut is way worse.
[00:43:36.840 --> 00:43:39.120]   And that's a bigger problem that Photoshop is hitting into too.
[00:43:39.120 --> 00:43:44.200]   And that is the iPad by comparison to a Mac is drastically RAM constrained.
[00:43:44.200 --> 00:43:48.720]   Like the iPad Pro has just gotten a six gigabytes of RAM where every modern Mac starts at eight
[00:43:48.720 --> 00:43:49.720]   gigabytes.
[00:43:49.720 --> 00:43:51.280]   All of them can go to 16 gigabytes.
[00:43:51.280 --> 00:43:55.560]   The MacBook Pros can go to 64, the Mac Pro I think can go all the way to, I don't know,
[00:43:55.560 --> 00:43:58.720]   Alaska on RAM and has no problem at all.
[00:43:58.720 --> 00:44:02.720]   But that's a real barrier for people with pro apps on the iPad.
[00:44:02.720 --> 00:44:05.160]   And until recently iPads didn't even swap.
[00:44:05.160 --> 00:44:09.480]   And I still don't know if they actually swap or now they just kind of sort of swap.
[00:44:09.480 --> 00:44:13.440]   But the Macs, the storage is so fast on the Mac that they're swapping all the time.
[00:44:13.440 --> 00:44:18.520]   It is such a different environment that I think it would be easy to make an app named
[00:44:18.520 --> 00:44:19.520]   Final Cut.
[00:44:19.520 --> 00:44:23.760]   I don't think Final Cut as we understand it or logic because people are pointing out how
[00:44:23.760 --> 00:44:29.720]   big certain instruments are and how much RAM instruments take up in logic.
[00:44:29.720 --> 00:44:30.720]   It's the same problem.
[00:44:30.720 --> 00:44:34.920]   But Xcode, if they could pick the things that like you as a developer Leo, you're away from
[00:44:34.920 --> 00:44:38.000]   your Mac, you have your iPad, there's certain things you want to do.
[00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:40.880]   And then it seamlessly sinks back to the Mac and you can do the other things you need
[00:44:40.880 --> 00:44:42.160]   to do there.
[00:44:42.160 --> 00:44:43.600]   There's a lot of levels.
[00:44:43.600 --> 00:44:46.400]   And so it's not clear what Xcode would be.
[00:44:46.400 --> 00:44:53.960]   Everything from what is apparently, according to Steve Mosher, already present in the preview
[00:44:53.960 --> 00:45:01.000]   app on iOS 13, which allows you to show layout previews on an device's screen so you can
[00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:05.120]   develop on your Mac, but see on the screen, do the screen layout.
[00:45:05.120 --> 00:45:09.680]   That would be the least valuable version of Xcode all the way up to an Xcode that would
[00:45:09.680 --> 00:45:11.320]   let you develop.
[00:45:11.320 --> 00:45:14.480]   I mean, at the very least, you'd be developing for iOS.
[00:45:14.480 --> 00:45:16.720]   You're really interested if you could develop for Mac OS.
[00:45:16.720 --> 00:45:19.520]   I bet you that's not in it.
[00:45:19.520 --> 00:45:22.920]   So you could see a scale of it.
[00:45:22.920 --> 00:45:30.000]   Prosser in response to Mosher said, "It's not the preview app that you're talking about."
[00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:34.080]   He says, "I know more than I have shown, but it's not that."
[00:45:34.080 --> 00:45:39.160]   So it's somewhere in between this very simple preview app and I would guess Mac OS.
[00:45:39.160 --> 00:45:40.160]   Xcode late.
[00:45:40.160 --> 00:45:44.680]   I don't want to develop.
[00:45:44.680 --> 00:45:47.880]   Most developers would rather have a big screen, maybe even two screens, maybe one sideways
[00:45:47.880 --> 00:45:48.880]   for the code.
[00:45:48.880 --> 00:45:54.240]   I mean, full keyboard, a mouse, most developers are not looking to develop on an iPad.
[00:45:54.240 --> 00:45:58.000]   So I think you'd have to think about what is it that you would want to offer that would
[00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:00.160]   make sense on the iPad.
[00:46:00.160 --> 00:46:05.480]   Also realize that Apple is selling, excuse me, Apple is selling iPads to education and the
[00:46:05.480 --> 00:46:06.960]   iPad is a very good computer.
[00:46:06.960 --> 00:46:12.520]   So the ability for a kid to build their own iPad apps or even build their own iPad is
[00:46:12.520 --> 00:46:13.520]   going up.
[00:46:13.520 --> 00:46:14.520]   I'll be the next step from Swift Playgrounds.
[00:46:14.520 --> 00:46:15.520]   You do Swift Playgrounds.
[00:46:15.520 --> 00:46:17.960]   Now, okay, I get it, I understand, but I want to write something.
[00:46:17.960 --> 00:46:20.400]   And that's where Swift Playgrounds falls down.
[00:46:20.400 --> 00:46:21.560]   I want to make something.
[00:46:21.560 --> 00:46:22.560]   You can even better, I want to sell something.
[00:46:22.560 --> 00:46:23.560]   I want to sell something.
[00:46:23.560 --> 00:46:24.560]   Or I want to sell something.
[00:46:24.560 --> 00:46:25.560]   Yeah.
[00:46:25.560 --> 00:46:28.400]   So I could see a Swift, for instance, Swift only because one of the big part, one of the
[00:46:28.400 --> 00:46:33.040]   things that makes Xcode so big is it it's all the cross development, all the extra languages.
[00:46:33.040 --> 00:46:38.520]   If you just had a Swift development system for the iPad, that would be very compelling
[00:46:38.520 --> 00:46:40.280]   exactly in the education environment.
[00:46:40.280 --> 00:46:41.880]   I think you're right, Andy.
[00:46:41.880 --> 00:46:46.400]   And for amateurs and people who just want to kind of lightweight coding, that would
[00:46:46.400 --> 00:46:48.200]   be very interesting.
[00:46:48.200 --> 00:46:55.440]   The reason it's important is we've always said Apple cannot abandon Mac OS until you can
[00:46:55.440 --> 00:46:58.560]   do everything on an iPad you could do on a Mac.
[00:46:58.560 --> 00:47:02.920]   And one of the big ones, one of the ones you cannot abandon Mac OS because all iPad
[00:47:02.920 --> 00:47:05.160]   and iOS apps are developed on a Mac.
[00:47:05.160 --> 00:47:07.400]   It's the only way you could do it.
[00:47:07.400 --> 00:47:10.440]   So imagine doing Mac apps on an iPad, like the inverse.
[00:47:10.440 --> 00:47:11.440]   That would be a Minecraft.
[00:47:11.440 --> 00:47:12.440]   Yeah.
[00:47:12.440 --> 00:47:13.440]   I mean, I guess you'd abandon.
[00:47:13.440 --> 00:47:15.880]   If you abandoned the Mac, you wouldn't have to worry about that.
[00:47:15.880 --> 00:47:18.080]   I don't think Apple's going to abandon the Mac.
[00:47:18.080 --> 00:47:20.080]   But no, I still think--
[00:47:20.080 --> 00:47:25.560]   This was without which nothing, a Cine Quandón for divanning the Mac is, well, then you're
[00:47:25.560 --> 00:47:27.480]   going to have development on the iPad.
[00:47:27.480 --> 00:47:28.480]   Yeah.
[00:47:28.480 --> 00:47:34.960]   I still think that Apple is moving towards if you have 12-- if you are a consumer, they
[00:47:34.960 --> 00:47:39.360]   kind of want the first computer you think of to be an iPad if you are what they define
[00:47:39.360 --> 00:47:40.360]   as a pro.
[00:47:40.360 --> 00:47:41.360]   They want you to think Mac.
[00:47:41.360 --> 00:47:42.360]   Yes.
[00:47:42.360 --> 00:47:43.360]   So, yeah.
[00:47:43.360 --> 00:47:44.360]   That's how you start.
[00:47:44.360 --> 00:47:45.360]   And maybe how you start coding in Swift.
[00:47:45.360 --> 00:47:46.360]   Yeah.
[00:47:46.360 --> 00:47:47.360]   I would be very interested.
[00:47:47.360 --> 00:47:50.200]   It's a great way to get people, especially kids on the platform, just to get all those
[00:47:50.200 --> 00:47:52.080]   people developing with Swift and SwiftUI.
[00:47:52.080 --> 00:47:55.040]   Swift Playgrounds is awesome.
[00:47:55.040 --> 00:47:57.240]   It would be a logical next step.
[00:47:57.240 --> 00:48:00.960]   Anyway, iOS 14 sounded better and better and better.
[00:48:00.960 --> 00:48:02.560]   There's all sorts of cool stuff.
[00:48:02.560 --> 00:48:04.880]   This is a hell of a year for iOS in the iPad.
[00:48:04.880 --> 00:48:06.160]   One hell of a great year.
[00:48:06.160 --> 00:48:07.160]   Yeah.
[00:48:07.160 --> 00:48:08.160]   Yeah.
[00:48:08.160 --> 00:48:09.160]   The keyboard is a big step forward as well.
[00:48:09.160 --> 00:48:11.040]   I can't wait to play with it.
[00:48:11.040 --> 00:48:16.840]   It is missing one thing programmers love, which is an escape key.
[00:48:16.840 --> 00:48:20.760]   I don't think-- I can't think of a single reason on iOS you'd need an escape key.
[00:48:20.760 --> 00:48:24.080]   But if you are going to code, you need it.
[00:48:24.080 --> 00:48:27.920]   It's a third-party hardware opportunity, just a Bluetooth escape key, just like one--
[00:48:27.920 --> 00:48:28.920]   It's just a fun one.
[00:48:28.920 --> 00:48:29.920]   --one red key.
[00:48:29.920 --> 00:48:32.440]   Oh, it could be a really big blue escape key.
[00:48:32.440 --> 00:48:35.720]   And you don't have any function keys on the new keyboard, which I do think is a little
[00:48:35.720 --> 00:48:37.600]   odd for media control and all that.
[00:48:37.600 --> 00:48:44.200]   But don't you have command key combinations for all of that or no?
[00:48:44.200 --> 00:48:47.640]   Well, also remember, there's a third-party opportunity.
[00:48:47.640 --> 00:48:52.040]   This is what Apple can really, really do when they know that they're not the only ones
[00:48:52.040 --> 00:48:54.360]   who are making every single instance of the hardware.
[00:48:54.360 --> 00:48:59.520]   So they can make-- only they can make the really cool $350 aspirational one that looks
[00:48:59.520 --> 00:49:02.640]   awesome that you probably can't afford, but it still looks awesome.
[00:49:02.640 --> 00:49:05.240]   And you're kind of proud to be using a computer that can use this.
[00:49:05.240 --> 00:49:09.320]   But then you'll go to Logitech to buy the affordable $120, $130 one.
[00:49:09.320 --> 00:49:12.160]   That maybe we'll have function keys and we'll have all the stuff you like.
[00:49:12.160 --> 00:49:19.080]   I can't wait to get on a plane or go to Starbucks and set up-- oh, never mind.
[00:49:19.080 --> 00:49:21.080]   You can't wait for me to ask you.
[00:49:21.080 --> 00:49:24.520]   Wait, I must-- no showing off for this one.
[00:49:24.520 --> 00:49:26.640]   No flexing with your keyboard, Leo.
[00:49:26.640 --> 00:49:28.040]   It is going to look pretty, isn't it?
[00:49:28.040 --> 00:49:32.200]   It's too bad no, I won't be able to show anybody.
[00:49:32.200 --> 00:49:34.520]   Lisa, look, I've seen it 100 times.
[00:49:34.520 --> 00:49:35.640]   No, but isn't it beautiful?
[00:49:35.640 --> 00:49:37.120]   I've seen it.
[00:49:37.120 --> 00:49:38.680]   But it's really good upside down.
[00:49:38.680 --> 00:49:41.840]   I was watching Justine and now I'm drawing.
[00:49:41.840 --> 00:49:43.480]   Notice me writing my screenplay.
[00:49:43.480 --> 00:49:44.800]   Please, it's all I have.
[00:49:44.800 --> 00:49:46.640]   I've seen it, Leo.
[00:49:46.640 --> 00:49:48.760]   Go away.
[00:49:48.760 --> 00:49:50.840]   Trying to work here.
[00:49:50.840 --> 00:49:52.160]   It used to be about the keyboard.
[00:49:52.160 --> 00:49:59.240]   Let's see.
[00:49:59.240 --> 00:50:01.000]   I don't know, which is more important.
[00:50:01.000 --> 00:50:02.760]   Apple's rumored over the ear headphones
[00:50:02.760 --> 00:50:06.120]   or that they're resurrecting Fraggle Rock.
[00:50:06.120 --> 00:50:08.800]   I'm going to say Fraggle Rock, but Lordy might hit me.
[00:50:08.800 --> 00:50:10.840]   No, I think that's pretty good.
[00:50:10.840 --> 00:50:13.160]   That resonates with the correct word.
[00:50:13.160 --> 00:50:15.880]   A new series of many episodes--
[00:50:15.880 --> 00:50:20.440]   Fraggle's were a Jim Henson kind of muppety kind of thing.
[00:50:20.440 --> 00:50:23.240]   This was after my time.
[00:50:23.240 --> 00:50:27.960]   But in other words, I was a grown up and didn't really care.
[00:50:27.960 --> 00:50:29.960]   It was an '80s children's series.
[00:50:29.960 --> 00:50:33.000]   There'll be a new series of free mini episodes
[00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:35.360]   produced by the Jim Henson company.
[00:50:35.360 --> 00:50:38.040]   There's a rumor that Georgia Dallas is read from Fraggle Rock
[00:50:38.040 --> 00:50:41.120]   and that is what her post-fraggle rock career was.
[00:50:41.120 --> 00:50:45.720]   Sometimes she makes those little blues.
[00:50:45.720 --> 00:50:48.040]   You would believe that for sure.
[00:50:48.040 --> 00:50:49.640]   Was there a volcano?
[00:50:49.640 --> 00:50:50.640]   Was there a bubbling mat?
[00:50:50.640 --> 00:50:54.440]   Was there a bubbling thing?
[00:50:54.440 --> 00:50:57.680]   They were Fraggles who lived underground.
[00:50:57.680 --> 00:51:02.280]   And the main character had--
[00:51:02.280 --> 00:51:05.120]   My favorite part was the uncle traveling mat
[00:51:05.120 --> 00:51:07.880]   with Gert inside sword, who basically was a muppet
[00:51:07.880 --> 00:51:10.320]   who could go in the real world and would send him postcards
[00:51:10.320 --> 00:51:12.800]   and tell him stories about how silly the humans are.
[00:51:12.800 --> 00:51:13.960]   And you'd have--
[00:51:13.960 --> 00:51:15.720]   We are silly.
[00:51:15.720 --> 00:51:17.400]   We are silly species.
[00:51:17.400 --> 00:51:21.920]   I'm rooting for you, but I'm only one alien.
[00:51:21.920 --> 00:51:24.880]   So this was the muppets for a little bit older kids?
[00:51:24.880 --> 00:51:26.080]   Is that it?
[00:51:26.080 --> 00:51:27.480]   Yeah, I think so.
[00:51:27.480 --> 00:51:31.440]   Well, it was a cable version of the muppets, I think,
[00:51:31.440 --> 00:51:34.400]   where you can do an entire storyline.
[00:51:34.400 --> 00:51:37.080]   You don't have to deal with a commercial break
[00:51:37.080 --> 00:51:38.680]   and also very little interference.
[00:51:38.680 --> 00:51:41.160]   I think this was pre-acquisitioned by Disney
[00:51:41.160 --> 00:51:43.120]   to, it was like 1982, 1983.
[00:51:43.120 --> 00:51:45.440]   This was one of the big acquisitions.
[00:51:45.440 --> 00:51:49.040]   Let me play it again here, because we didn't get the audio.
[00:51:49.040 --> 00:51:49.640]   Oh, John.
[00:51:49.640 --> 00:51:51.960]   Disney only 89% of my childhood.
[00:51:51.960 --> 00:51:52.800]   Yeah.
[00:51:52.800 --> 00:51:54.480]   I restarted it just for you, John.
[00:51:54.480 --> 00:52:00.640]   All right, Carson saying, if you play this,
[00:52:00.640 --> 00:52:01.840]   we'll be taking down--
[00:52:01.840 --> 00:52:04.240]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:52:04.240 --> 00:52:06.360]   Touch her.
[00:52:06.360 --> 00:52:07.440]   Which way through the hand clips?
[00:52:07.440 --> 00:52:10.840]   It's rock and roll muppets.
[00:52:10.840 --> 00:52:12.600]   Let me use a clip.
[00:52:12.600 --> 00:52:13.600]   Oh, you guys know it.
[00:52:13.600 --> 00:52:16.040]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:52:16.040 --> 00:52:17.040]   OK.
[00:52:17.040 --> 00:52:18.040]   That and Frank and Ron.
[00:52:18.040 --> 00:52:18.760]   That and Frank and Ron.
[00:52:18.760 --> 00:52:21.640]   Andy, you were the child during this.
[00:52:21.640 --> 00:52:23.080]   I'm a Frank and Ron.
[00:52:23.080 --> 00:52:24.080]   Yeah.
[00:52:24.080 --> 00:52:29.000]   I was a fan of the Yoda puppet, the dark crystal.
[00:52:29.000 --> 00:52:30.480]   I felt as though this would expand
[00:52:30.480 --> 00:52:33.800]   my understanding of the puppeteurial arts.
[00:52:33.800 --> 00:52:34.320]   OK.
[00:52:34.320 --> 00:52:34.840]   OK.
[00:52:34.840 --> 00:52:35.480]   I was just checking.
[00:52:35.480 --> 00:52:36.000]   It was cool.
[00:52:36.000 --> 00:52:38.600]   It doesn't have to be a kid to enjoy.
[00:52:38.600 --> 00:52:41.920]   The day you outgrow the boomerang fish
[00:52:41.920 --> 00:52:44.920]   thrower on the muppets.
[00:52:44.920 --> 00:52:48.040]   I think that's the day you leave behind a part of your childhood.
[00:52:48.040 --> 00:52:49.760]   You're going to wish that you still had with you.
[00:52:49.760 --> 00:52:53.520]   Well, now we can rediscover the fragles all over again.
[00:52:53.520 --> 00:52:56.400]   Sell our childhood back to us at an extreme markup.
[00:52:56.400 --> 00:52:57.440]   Go ahead.
[00:52:57.440 --> 00:52:58.360]   We're used to it by now.
[00:52:58.360 --> 00:52:58.960]   In transit.
[00:52:58.960 --> 00:53:01.360]   This is coming to Apple and not Disney, though.
[00:53:01.360 --> 00:53:03.320]   Oh, was it a Disney property?
[00:53:03.320 --> 00:53:04.440]   Well, Disney owns Muppets.
[00:53:04.440 --> 00:53:06.080]   But I guess they don't own the whole--
[00:53:06.080 --> 00:53:09.720]   They don't own the Jim Henson Company.
[00:53:09.720 --> 00:53:13.680]   But they must have made a pitch.
[00:53:13.680 --> 00:53:15.400]   Yeah, would be a natural place for it.
[00:53:15.400 --> 00:53:17.480]   But guess who might have outbid Disney?
[00:53:17.480 --> 00:53:18.760]   There's only one company in the world
[00:53:18.760 --> 00:53:21.280]   to get outbid Disney, right?
[00:53:21.280 --> 00:53:22.680]   Eddie, check myself a cushion.
[00:53:22.680 --> 00:53:23.680]   Check myself a cushion.
[00:53:23.680 --> 00:53:26.320]   Check myself a cushion.
[00:53:26.320 --> 00:53:26.960]   He doesn't have some--
[00:53:26.960 --> 00:53:28.880]   He doesn't have some--
[00:53:28.880 --> 00:53:30.560]   We talk about Jim Lucky as founder money.
[00:53:30.560 --> 00:53:33.440]   He doesn't have like Steve Jobs, Jeff Bezos, Bill Gates
[00:53:33.440 --> 00:53:33.960]   money.
[00:53:33.960 --> 00:53:36.000]   He was not a founder.
[00:53:36.000 --> 00:53:41.000]   Joe Widdeschick has a scoop on iMore.
[00:53:41.000 --> 00:53:44.920]   The iPhone SE may be assembled in Brazil.
[00:53:44.920 --> 00:53:48.120]   All of them are just the Brazilian ones.
[00:53:48.120 --> 00:53:50.480]   Just the Brazilian iPhones?
[00:53:50.480 --> 00:53:53.160]   No, I'm pretty sure all of them are fish.
[00:53:53.160 --> 00:53:54.280]   Maybe possibly.
[00:53:54.280 --> 00:53:55.760]   Wow.
[00:53:55.760 --> 00:53:58.480]   This is a FoxCon plant that's in Brazil.
[00:53:58.480 --> 00:54:02.200]   FoxCon has to build iPhones in Brazil and India
[00:54:02.200 --> 00:54:05.920]   because those two countries will not allow--
[00:54:05.920 --> 00:54:07.400]   or else they're highly tariff.
[00:54:07.400 --> 00:54:08.200]   Maybe I know India.
[00:54:08.200 --> 00:54:11.600]   Yes, India won't allow at all a product not made in India.
[00:54:11.600 --> 00:54:15.640]   And I think Brazil maybe just the tariffs are out through the roof.
[00:54:15.640 --> 00:54:17.960]   So Apple does make phones there.
[00:54:17.960 --> 00:54:20.080]   And everybody I think makes--
[00:54:20.080 --> 00:54:21.680]   FoxCon has plants there.
[00:54:21.680 --> 00:54:24.720]   But it sounds like that Apple may be assembling it in Brazil,
[00:54:24.720 --> 00:54:27.640]   which-- and you'll know when you get it, if on the back it
[00:54:27.640 --> 00:54:31.240]   says in Dustreab, Residaria or something.
[00:54:31.240 --> 00:54:32.240]   Designed by--
[00:54:32.240 --> 00:54:33.240]   [INTERPOSING VOICES]
[00:54:33.240 --> 00:54:35.440]   They're made with real sugar, as opposed to--
[00:54:35.440 --> 00:54:37.440]   Ooh.
[00:54:37.440 --> 00:54:42.280]   The new Brazilian iPhone SE, made with real sugar.
[00:54:42.280 --> 00:54:44.240]   I think it's going to be interesting over the next year
[00:54:44.240 --> 00:54:46.760]   or two to flip over every single Apple device
[00:54:46.760 --> 00:54:48.520]   that we see to see how many of them
[00:54:48.520 --> 00:54:50.680]   are no longer being made in China.
[00:54:50.680 --> 00:54:54.280]   Or if they're going to move towards--
[00:54:54.280 --> 00:54:56.400]   China gets to make half the phones,
[00:54:56.400 --> 00:54:58.320]   but they're also going to make some in Vietnam.
[00:54:58.320 --> 00:55:00.520]   They're also going to make some in India.
[00:55:00.520 --> 00:55:03.920]   They're also going-- not even just for local distribution,
[00:55:03.920 --> 00:55:08.000]   because relying 100% on one country
[00:55:08.000 --> 00:55:09.760]   kind of bit a lot of companies in the butt.
[00:55:09.760 --> 00:55:12.000]   And I think that there's a lot of lessons I'm going to learn.
[00:55:12.000 --> 00:55:13.040]   Yeah.
[00:55:13.040 --> 00:55:15.840]   Just one more note on the magic keyboard,
[00:55:15.840 --> 00:55:18.840]   the new keyboard for the iPad, Gruber,
[00:55:18.840 --> 00:55:23.240]   an initial impression, crushingly disappointing,
[00:55:23.240 --> 00:55:25.080]   because it was so stiff.
[00:55:25.080 --> 00:55:28.960]   But it only took him two paragraphs, two paragraphs,
[00:55:28.960 --> 00:55:31.160]   to say, this thing is great.
[00:55:31.160 --> 00:55:33.920]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:55:33.920 --> 00:55:37.240]   Once I let go of my preconceptions, I fell in love.
[00:55:37.240 --> 00:55:39.440]   This took me all of 15 minutes.
[00:55:39.440 --> 00:55:41.680]   I went from, I don't like the way this thing feels at all,
[00:55:41.680 --> 00:55:45.080]   to I can't wait to start raving about how great this thing is.
[00:55:45.080 --> 00:55:50.840]   It is the case that the iPad Pro 12.9-inch plus magic
[00:55:50.840 --> 00:55:55.920]   keyboard actually weighs more than the MacBook Air.
[00:55:55.920 --> 00:55:56.760]   Yeah, I think that's--
[00:55:56.760 --> 00:56:00.120]   So you have to come back to this idea
[00:56:00.120 --> 00:56:03.360]   that the reason a keyboard case like that
[00:56:03.360 --> 00:56:07.040]   has to be so heavy is that the iPad itself is so heavy.
[00:56:07.040 --> 00:56:08.200]   So if it's--
[00:56:08.200 --> 00:56:08.680]   Right.
[00:56:08.680 --> 00:56:09.280]   --it's hinge--
[00:56:09.280 --> 00:56:09.760]   It would fall over.
[00:56:09.760 --> 00:56:11.960]   --instead of having a kickstand.
[00:56:11.960 --> 00:56:12.440]   Right.
[00:56:12.440 --> 00:56:14.760]   It needs the bottom weight, or it needs
[00:56:14.760 --> 00:56:17.000]   some additional weight to balance it out.
[00:56:17.000 --> 00:56:21.560]   And Apple made a keyboard that is intended to sit on your lap.
[00:56:21.560 --> 00:56:22.600]   It's a weighted--
[00:56:22.600 --> 00:56:24.480]   It's a weighted base, basically.
[00:56:24.480 --> 00:56:25.960]   So it needs to be heavy.
[00:56:25.960 --> 00:56:29.520]   So I think a lot of people are expecting the magic keyboard
[00:56:29.520 --> 00:56:33.080]   case to suddenly be as light as the magic--
[00:56:33.080 --> 00:56:36.640]   or the smart keyboard folio or something like that.
[00:56:36.640 --> 00:56:38.560]   And that just can't happen.
[00:56:38.560 --> 00:56:41.760]   Or the iPad falls over.
[00:56:41.760 --> 00:56:44.200]   It's too heavy to handle something like that.
[00:56:44.200 --> 00:56:48.840]   And I think Groover explains it very well and very detailed
[00:56:48.840 --> 00:56:52.200]   and a way to understand that if you were to--
[00:56:52.200 --> 00:56:55.920]   I think he describes if you were to flip your MacBook
[00:56:55.920 --> 00:57:00.120]   or your MacBook Air over, so that the screen is on the ground
[00:57:00.120 --> 00:57:01.240]   or facing down.
[00:57:01.240 --> 00:57:03.040]   And then you try to open that.
[00:57:03.040 --> 00:57:05.360]   You can't open that because of the way it's weighted.
[00:57:05.360 --> 00:57:08.960]   It's because the screen itself is so lightweight
[00:57:08.960 --> 00:57:10.480]   that it will kind of go with it.
[00:57:10.480 --> 00:57:15.080]   So Apple had to make a keyboard base that is just as heavy,
[00:57:15.080 --> 00:57:18.320]   or even maybe a little heavier than the iPad itself,
[00:57:18.320 --> 00:57:21.640]   so that it can have that proper weight and not fall over.
[00:57:21.640 --> 00:57:22.920]   And that makes a lot of sense.
[00:57:22.920 --> 00:57:27.720]   Some of the better clamshell style keyboard cases out there
[00:57:27.720 --> 00:57:30.040]   are the same way they're heavy, because they need to be
[00:57:30.040 --> 00:57:32.360]   so the weighting can be distributed properly.
[00:57:32.360 --> 00:57:34.240]   I'm not sure how so many people got it.
[00:57:34.240 --> 00:57:36.240]   I mean, mine's not going to go till Friday.
[00:57:36.240 --> 00:57:39.480]   Maybe they chose Expedite or something.
[00:57:39.480 --> 00:57:42.600]   Groover actually specifically says that that was the review
[00:57:42.600 --> 00:57:43.520]   unit that he had.
[00:57:43.520 --> 00:57:44.920]   But some people got it really early.
[00:57:44.920 --> 00:57:45.920]   There are people who got it.
[00:57:45.920 --> 00:57:48.640]   There are people in our chat room who have it.
[00:57:48.640 --> 00:57:54.160]   I think the 21st was the official date for shipping
[00:57:54.160 --> 00:57:55.240]   if you didn't follow that.
[00:57:55.240 --> 00:57:57.040]   It's actually got his to looking forward
[00:57:57.040 --> 00:57:58.320]   to hearing what he thinks.
[00:57:58.320 --> 00:58:01.280]   My artist, Interchaperim, says I have the new keyboard.
[00:58:01.280 --> 00:58:03.440]   It's fantastic.
[00:58:03.440 --> 00:58:07.960]   Baba, who's in the UK, says he loves it.
[00:58:07.960 --> 00:58:10.440]   The magic keyboard is very laughable.
[00:58:10.440 --> 00:58:14.880]   So there are people even in our chat room who have it.
[00:58:14.880 --> 00:58:16.880]   So anyway, I can't wait.
[00:58:16.880 --> 00:58:20.360]   It's going to be-- it's not exactly--
[00:58:20.360 --> 00:58:22.760]   it's something new.
[00:58:22.760 --> 00:58:26.560]   Yeah, and like I said, this isn't the only solution that's
[00:58:26.560 --> 00:58:27.000]   out there.
[00:58:27.000 --> 00:58:30.560]   And I hope we get to see a whole bunch of different makers
[00:58:30.560 --> 00:58:31.400]   with their--
[00:58:31.400 --> 00:58:31.920]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:58:31.920 --> 00:58:33.040]   I hope we get to see a different--
[00:58:33.040 --> 00:58:34.760]   I'm going to text this for the iPad.
[00:58:34.760 --> 00:58:38.040]   To be clear, it's for the iPad and iPad Air.
[00:58:38.040 --> 00:58:39.640]   Not for the iPad Pro.
[00:58:39.640 --> 00:58:41.680]   I think there was kind of a collaboration with the--
[00:58:41.680 --> 00:58:45.840]   It uses the smart connector at the bottom.
[00:58:45.840 --> 00:58:48.880]   I would even consider something that's even bulkier than that.
[00:58:48.880 --> 00:58:51.960]   If someone sold a frame that--
[00:58:51.960 --> 00:58:54.680]   something that's more like a conventional laptop
[00:58:54.680 --> 00:58:57.600]   and the screen part, the part that holds the iPad
[00:58:57.600 --> 00:59:01.640]   is actually an aluminum frame that you can simply pull apart
[00:59:01.640 --> 00:59:04.200]   and then sort of trap it in there to turn it
[00:59:04.200 --> 00:59:05.920]   into more of a conventional notebook
[00:59:05.920 --> 00:59:09.800]   when if you're buying this iPad as a conventional notebook.
[00:59:09.800 --> 00:59:11.120]   For me personally, that's something
[00:59:11.120 --> 00:59:12.560]   that I would be very, very interested in,
[00:59:12.560 --> 00:59:15.920]   particularly if it had a 360 degree hinge,
[00:59:15.920 --> 00:59:17.960]   because that is really one of the things
[00:59:17.960 --> 00:59:20.600]   that I adore about certain Chromebooks
[00:59:20.600 --> 00:59:23.240]   and certain Windows machines, a 360 degree hinge.
[00:59:23.240 --> 00:59:26.200]   I had no idea how much I would appreciate it and use it
[00:59:26.200 --> 00:59:28.880]   until I actually had one in my bag at all times.
[00:59:28.880 --> 00:59:30.360]   So yeah, there are going to be people who
[00:59:30.360 --> 00:59:31.760]   are going to be disappointed because it's not
[00:59:31.760 --> 00:59:35.040]   like a flimsy cardboard.
[00:59:35.040 --> 00:59:37.200]   I have an incidental use to maybe fire off
[00:59:37.200 --> 00:59:39.560]   a couple of emails or messages type keyboard,
[00:59:39.560 --> 00:59:42.120]   but then there are going to be people who are going to be--
[00:59:42.120 --> 00:59:43.760]   this is not going to be capturing stuff,
[00:59:43.760 --> 00:59:47.240]   and then actually writing a 1,000, 1,500 word article
[00:59:47.240 --> 00:59:50.000]   and then posting it on my website with video and with pictures.
[00:59:50.000 --> 00:59:52.120]   And those are the people who are not going to mind
[00:59:52.120 --> 00:59:53.760]   like an extra two pounds if it means
[00:59:53.760 --> 00:59:56.880]   that this thing will not flex in their laps
[00:59:56.880 --> 00:59:59.200]   and it gives them all the free creature comforts
[00:59:59.200 --> 01:00:00.040]   that they like.
[01:00:00.040 --> 01:00:02.160]   One thing I think there was a misunderstanding,
[01:00:02.160 --> 01:00:03.960]   like I think some people-- and maybe this
[01:00:03.960 --> 01:00:05.760]   was how Apple positioned it, but some people looked at it
[01:00:05.760 --> 01:00:06.960]   as just another case.
[01:00:06.960 --> 01:00:09.200]   It was like a better version of the existing case.
[01:00:09.200 --> 01:00:09.920]   And it's not at all.
[01:00:09.920 --> 01:00:10.720]   It is a dock.
[01:00:10.720 --> 01:00:12.320]   Like when you swatch that original click,
[01:00:12.320 --> 01:00:13.160]   there's a leaky video.
[01:00:13.160 --> 01:00:14.280]   It's on the table.
[01:00:14.280 --> 01:00:14.800]   He comes.
[01:00:14.800 --> 01:00:16.600]   He slaps the iPad down onto it.
[01:00:16.600 --> 01:00:18.960]   He uses it, and he picks it up, and he walks away.
[01:00:18.960 --> 01:00:21.200]   Like he's not walking around with that thing.
[01:00:21.200 --> 01:00:22.760]   It's like, no, this is still a tablet.
[01:00:22.760 --> 01:00:25.320]   We're not making a laptop that you can pull the screen off of.
[01:00:25.320 --> 01:00:26.120]   This is a tablet.
[01:00:26.120 --> 01:00:27.440]   If you want to use it like a laptop,
[01:00:27.440 --> 01:00:28.840]   you can put it down in this dock.
[01:00:28.840 --> 01:00:30.520]   It's even got a little power plug for you.
[01:00:30.520 --> 01:00:32.840]   You're OK, but when you're done with it,
[01:00:32.840 --> 01:00:35.080]   you peel this off and you go back to your iPad life.
[01:00:35.080 --> 01:00:37.280]   And I think that's the mental difference
[01:00:37.280 --> 01:00:38.400]   you have to get yourself into.
[01:00:38.400 --> 01:00:41.640]   I am glad that they didn't do the kickstand thing that Microsoft
[01:00:41.640 --> 01:00:42.440]   does with Surface.
[01:00:42.440 --> 01:00:45.360]   I really-- it's not only unesthetic.
[01:00:45.360 --> 01:00:47.920]   I always have to remember to do it.
[01:00:47.920 --> 01:00:51.360]   On the other hand, it's not going farther than 130 degrees.
[01:00:51.360 --> 01:00:52.200]   I was surprised.
[01:00:52.200 --> 01:00:55.080]   I got the impression it would be kind of an infinite--
[01:00:55.080 --> 01:00:56.240]   It tips over.
[01:00:56.240 --> 01:00:57.240]   I was watching some demos.
[01:00:57.240 --> 01:00:59.080]   It tips over if it goes too far.
[01:00:59.080 --> 01:01:01.520]   It'll fall right over.
[01:01:01.520 --> 01:01:02.600]   Yeah.
[01:01:02.600 --> 01:01:05.400]   I hope we get to see even larger iPads now,
[01:01:05.400 --> 01:01:08.560]   because I would particularly-- particularly for creators
[01:01:08.560 --> 01:01:11.480]   who are now using it as their artist device.
[01:01:11.480 --> 01:01:13.440]   I think that there is now a case to be made--
[01:01:13.440 --> 01:01:16.040]   I mean, like an argument to be made for a 14-inch iPad
[01:01:16.040 --> 01:01:18.000]   if they wanted to do that.
[01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:19.800]   Mark Edwards wants 120-inch.
[01:01:19.800 --> 01:01:22.720]   He wants his whole drafting tape.
[01:01:22.720 --> 01:01:24.640]   Logitech-- He's so talented I want it that too.
[01:01:24.640 --> 01:01:26.400]   I mean, Lenovo briefly--
[01:01:26.400 --> 01:01:27.480]   I don't know if they still do them.
[01:01:27.480 --> 01:01:27.880]   Maybe they do.
[01:01:27.880 --> 01:01:30.360]   They made a tablet as big as this screen.
[01:01:30.360 --> 01:01:31.480]   How big is your Surface?
[01:01:31.480 --> 01:01:32.280]   27-leo?
[01:01:32.280 --> 01:01:34.360]   Yeah, they had a giant 27.
[01:01:34.360 --> 01:01:35.800]   27-inch iPad, it'd be nice.
[01:01:35.800 --> 01:01:37.520]   Yeah, they made it.
[01:01:37.520 --> 01:01:38.880]   It was a little ungainly.
[01:01:38.880 --> 01:01:39.400]   It was weird.
[01:01:39.400 --> 01:01:41.720]   We reviewed it a few years ago.
[01:01:41.720 --> 01:01:43.200]   It was more of a conference room,
[01:01:43.200 --> 01:01:44.600]   like whiteboard sort of thing.
[01:01:44.600 --> 01:01:45.400]   Yes, yeah.
[01:01:45.400 --> 01:01:47.120]   But yeah, it's nice to be out there.
[01:01:47.120 --> 01:01:50.760]   It's nice to have that SKU for people who, again,
[01:01:50.760 --> 01:01:53.200]   if you're the one oddball out of 1,000 who
[01:01:53.200 --> 01:01:55.240]   can make a use case for that or have so much money
[01:01:55.240 --> 01:01:57.880]   that they just want it for their collection.
[01:01:57.880 --> 01:01:59.040]   And you were saying, I just--
[01:01:59.040 --> 01:02:03.200]   Dean had a unique way of propping it up upside down.
[01:02:03.200 --> 01:02:05.000]   Well, someone asked me on Twitter, and I didn't have one.
[01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:06.000]   So I directed them to Justine.
[01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:07.560]   And in her latest video, she shows,
[01:02:07.560 --> 01:02:10.240]   like, you basically put it down the other way around.
[01:02:10.240 --> 01:02:13.000]   So you put it flat on-- you put it backside down.
[01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:14.800]   And then the keyboard part juts up,
[01:02:14.800 --> 01:02:17.120]   but you can sit there drawing on it like an easel.
[01:02:17.120 --> 01:02:19.280]   And she said it's very stable that way.
[01:02:19.280 --> 01:02:20.600]   Weird.
[01:02:20.600 --> 01:02:21.120]   Weird.
[01:02:21.120 --> 01:02:21.880]   Let me see if I can find it.
[01:02:21.880 --> 01:02:22.880]   Well, some people want to draw.
[01:02:22.880 --> 01:02:25.280]   And Apple hasn't been serving that market for a while.
[01:02:25.280 --> 01:02:27.440]   Like, the second generation, the one
[01:02:27.440 --> 01:02:29.440]   that's on the new iPad Pro, that doesn't
[01:02:29.440 --> 01:02:32.080]   fold back into an easel mode the way the original origami
[01:02:32.080 --> 01:02:33.320]   smart keyboard did.
[01:02:33.320 --> 01:02:34.520]   And now this one doesn't really.
[01:02:34.520 --> 01:02:36.320]   But people are innovatively, oh, they're ingenious.
[01:02:36.320 --> 01:02:37.440]   They can figure these things out.
[01:02:37.440 --> 01:02:38.880]   Yeah.
[01:02:38.880 --> 01:02:39.600]   Isn't that weird?
[01:02:39.600 --> 01:02:41.400]   Because it really is a big market.
[01:02:41.400 --> 01:02:45.280]   And when the customers keep telling you by abusing the way
[01:02:45.280 --> 01:02:45.560]   that--
[01:02:45.560 --> 01:02:46.080]   Yes.
[01:02:46.080 --> 01:02:47.680]   --but by using your product and ways you didn't--
[01:02:47.680 --> 01:02:51.560]   so when they tell you, this is how we want to use it.
[01:02:51.560 --> 01:02:53.800]   And particularly when all the conversations
[01:02:53.800 --> 01:02:56.880]   in every single digital illustration board is--
[01:02:56.880 --> 01:03:00.280]   like, at least half of it is about, hey, I'm switching
[01:03:00.280 --> 01:03:02.480]   to digital coloring or digital inking, or here's--
[01:03:02.480 --> 01:03:03.760]   I can't get this pen to work.
[01:03:03.760 --> 01:03:06.480]   It was the best set of pens to use and procreate.
[01:03:06.480 --> 01:03:09.400]   I really think that Apple is missing a trick, or maybe--
[01:03:09.400 --> 01:03:11.040]   or I'm sorry, they probably are aware of it,
[01:03:11.040 --> 01:03:13.160]   but they haven't made the money work out yet.
[01:03:13.160 --> 01:03:18.240]   But yeah, I am in the market this year or early next
[01:03:18.240 --> 01:03:20.240]   for an upgrade to my laptop.
[01:03:20.240 --> 01:03:23.440]   And boy, that would get my attention in a huge way
[01:03:23.440 --> 01:03:25.600]   if there was an iPad with larger screen.
[01:03:25.600 --> 01:03:27.080]   That's the interesting question.
[01:03:27.080 --> 01:03:27.800]   Yeah.
[01:03:27.800 --> 01:03:31.400]   Do I buy a laptop? Do I buy an iPad?
[01:03:31.400 --> 01:03:31.840]   Yeah.
[01:03:31.840 --> 01:03:37.160]   These days you can almost ask that question legitimately.
[01:03:37.160 --> 01:03:40.960]   There's a lot of people for which an iPad, especially an iPad
[01:03:40.960 --> 01:03:44.040]   Pro, would be good enough replacement for a laptop,
[01:03:44.040 --> 01:03:46.600]   but they wouldn't need more than that.
[01:03:46.600 --> 01:03:50.040]   Yeah, also, the last time I bought a new notebook
[01:03:50.040 --> 01:03:55.920]   was in 2015 when-- again, I famously
[01:03:55.920 --> 01:03:57.640]   emptied a glass of Diet Dr. Pepper
[01:03:57.640 --> 01:04:00.080]   while falling asleep in a hotel room the night before I was
[01:04:00.080 --> 01:04:02.400]   supposed to give a keynote address at a conference.
[01:04:02.400 --> 01:04:06.960]   And so I basically had to say, OK, Pilgrim, you committed
[01:04:06.960 --> 01:04:08.200]   to giving this keynote.
[01:04:08.200 --> 01:04:10.960]   There's an Apple store right across the parking lot
[01:04:10.960 --> 01:04:12.000]   from this hotel.
[01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:13.480]   You have $2,000.
[01:04:13.480 --> 01:04:15.080]   It's time to go.
[01:04:15.080 --> 01:04:20.760]   But even between 2015 and now, my thinking is no longer
[01:04:20.760 --> 01:04:23.520]   if I have a limited amount of money to spend and believe me,
[01:04:23.520 --> 01:04:25.720]   I do.
[01:04:25.720 --> 01:04:29.680]   I want to buy the best MacBook I can and use it as both as a desktop
[01:04:29.680 --> 01:04:30.440]   and a notebook.
[01:04:30.440 --> 01:04:33.360]   Now my thinking is more things have changed so much
[01:04:33.360 --> 01:04:35.840]   that I'm actually now want to split my money
[01:04:35.840 --> 01:04:39.640]   between a really, really powerful Mac Mini for the desktop
[01:04:39.640 --> 01:04:42.680]   use, and that really frees me up to make all kinds of creative
[01:04:42.680 --> 01:04:44.360]   choices on the mobile solution.
[01:04:44.360 --> 01:04:47.160]   And what Apple has done with the iPad this year
[01:04:47.160 --> 01:04:51.320]   has made me think, geez, maybe I really can reinvest in the iPad
[01:04:51.320 --> 01:04:54.760]   and make that my mobile computer from now on.
[01:04:54.760 --> 01:04:57.360]   Well, I'll let you do that experiment.
[01:04:57.360 --> 01:05:00.400]   A lot of people we know, including Mike Elgin,
[01:05:00.400 --> 01:05:02.680]   tried to do that with the iPad.
[01:05:02.680 --> 01:05:04.920]   But I think now it's a little closer than it was.
[01:05:04.920 --> 01:05:05.920]   Yeah, the TV is now.
[01:05:05.920 --> 01:05:08.920]   There are several people who are iPad only for a couple of years
[01:05:08.920 --> 01:05:09.440]   now.
[01:05:09.440 --> 01:05:09.640]   Yeah.
[01:05:09.640 --> 01:05:10.240]   David's far--
[01:05:10.240 --> 01:05:10.960]   This is different.
[01:05:10.960 --> 01:05:12.000]   Yeah, this is different.
[01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:14.680]   This makes it really more of a computer.
[01:05:14.680 --> 01:05:16.720]   I always felt like I was compromising,
[01:05:16.720 --> 01:05:18.880]   where I had to struggle to do the things I wanted to do.
[01:05:18.880 --> 01:05:20.120]   It was a little too much work.
[01:05:22.760 --> 01:05:23.440]   Let's take a break.
[01:05:23.440 --> 01:05:25.600]   Then we have more to talk about.
[01:05:25.600 --> 01:05:29.160]   I am back break weekly with Andy and Aco, Laurie Gill,
[01:05:29.160 --> 01:05:33.480]   Renee Ritchie, and our great sponsor, Hover.
[01:05:33.480 --> 01:05:36.560]   I am always out there registering domain names.
[01:05:36.560 --> 01:05:38.120]   I have a bad habit.
[01:05:38.120 --> 01:05:42.840]   For instance, Jitsi, I wanted to set up my own Jitsi server.
[01:05:42.840 --> 01:05:45.720]   And I look through all my Twitch domain names,
[01:05:45.720 --> 01:05:47.120]   and I have literally dozens.
[01:05:47.120 --> 01:05:48.640]   Nothing was quite right.
[01:05:48.640 --> 01:05:52.720]   I went to Hover.com, and look, I found Twitch.team.
[01:05:52.720 --> 01:05:56.840]   Perfect, perfect for a team server.
[01:05:56.840 --> 01:05:58.800]   So I registered it, and five minutes later,
[01:05:58.800 --> 01:06:01.320]   I'm up and running with my own server,
[01:06:01.320 --> 01:06:02.840]   using a domain name from Hover.
[01:06:02.840 --> 01:06:04.960]   That's where a domain name, really--
[01:06:04.960 --> 01:06:08.960]   a great domain registrar is really a great thing to have.
[01:06:08.960 --> 01:06:10.320]   This is a vulnerable time.
[01:06:10.320 --> 01:06:13.840]   As you know, we're all needing each other more than ever.
[01:06:13.840 --> 01:06:17.400]   And having a domain name that really represents you
[01:06:17.400 --> 01:06:20.120]   kind of helped stay in touch.
[01:06:20.120 --> 01:06:22.880]   It's great for my video conferencing.
[01:06:22.880 --> 01:06:25.000]   Whenever I want to do a video conferencing now,
[01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:29.400]   it's twit.team/family or/friends.
[01:06:29.400 --> 01:06:33.080]   You could choose from over 400 plus domain name extensions
[01:06:33.080 --> 01:06:34.200]   at Hover.com.
[01:06:34.200 --> 01:06:37.480]   So it's easy to find one that's just right for you.
[01:06:37.480 --> 01:06:38.680]   No matter what you want to build,
[01:06:38.680 --> 01:06:40.360]   there's a domain name waiting for it.
[01:06:40.360 --> 01:06:42.960]   As an artist, what about dot art, right?
[01:06:42.960 --> 01:06:44.400]   Wouldn't that be crazy?
[01:06:44.400 --> 01:06:46.520]   If you're a ninja, there's not ninja.
[01:06:46.520 --> 01:06:50.080]   If you like pizza a lot, there's dot pizza, really.
[01:06:50.080 --> 01:06:52.600]   And it's like, yeah, who doesn't, right?
[01:06:52.600 --> 01:06:55.080]   I thought about twit.pizza for a little while,
[01:06:55.080 --> 01:06:56.960]   but then I ended up going to twit.team.
[01:06:56.960 --> 01:06:59.200]   I think it's interesting that we're talking about the--
[01:06:59.200 --> 01:07:02.000]   trying to solve the marketing visibility problem
[01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:04.560]   of ninja organizations.
[01:07:04.560 --> 01:07:07.520]   They're invisible, but they still have an internet presence.
[01:07:07.520 --> 01:07:08.960]   Now, you don't want to bring that?
[01:07:08.960 --> 01:07:10.520]   You want to be invisible to your enemies,
[01:07:10.520 --> 01:07:12.160]   but not to your target audience.
[01:07:12.160 --> 01:07:14.200]   Well, that's where a custom Hover domain name will help.
[01:07:14.200 --> 01:07:19.680]   Earth.dating.equipment.express.biz.net.com.
[01:07:19.680 --> 01:07:20.920]   They're all there.
[01:07:20.920 --> 01:07:22.640]   If you're an artist and you get dot art,
[01:07:22.640 --> 01:07:24.840]   you could make a domain.
[01:07:24.840 --> 01:07:26.240]   You could get the dot art.
[01:07:26.240 --> 01:07:28.640]   You could have a custom domain for every individual piece
[01:07:28.640 --> 01:07:29.000]   of art.
[01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:30.680]   How about that?
[01:07:30.680 --> 01:07:32.000]   Mypainting.art.
[01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:33.160]   My otherpainting.art.
[01:07:33.160 --> 01:07:35.200]   My landscape.art.
[01:07:35.200 --> 01:07:38.520]   It could basically dot art could be a catalog
[01:07:38.520 --> 01:07:41.120]   where you could showcase each design with descriptions
[01:07:41.120 --> 01:07:42.960]   and details people could view from all over the world.
[01:07:42.960 --> 01:07:45.160]   I kind of did that when I wanted
[01:07:45.160 --> 01:07:49.240]   to have a custom domain for my photo portfolio.
[01:07:49.240 --> 01:07:51.720]   I couldn't get Leo dot photo, but I got Leo dot camera,
[01:07:51.720 --> 01:07:53.880]   which I actually even way like better.
[01:07:53.880 --> 01:07:57.720]   So that's where I put all my best photos at Leo dot camera.
[01:07:57.720 --> 01:08:01.320]   For many entrepreneurs, artists, creators,
[01:08:01.320 --> 01:08:03.520]   and even just geeks who want to have some fun
[01:08:03.520 --> 01:08:06.920]   with domain names, Hover is a great jumping off point.
[01:08:06.920 --> 01:08:09.280]   They want you to start your business, display your talent
[01:08:09.280 --> 01:08:12.000]   with a domain name that reflects you, your interests,
[01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:12.840]   your love.
[01:08:12.840 --> 01:08:15.840]   It's not hard to see why Hover is the most popular
[01:08:15.840 --> 01:08:18.640]   and the best choice for people starting business.
[01:08:18.640 --> 01:08:20.240]   And by the way, I'm just going to give them
[01:08:20.240 --> 01:08:22.680]   a plug for their great technical support.
[01:08:22.680 --> 01:08:23.920]   They're fabulous people.
[01:08:23.920 --> 01:08:26.440]   They're there to answer your questions anytime.
[01:08:26.440 --> 01:08:29.240]   And I really love it that there's not a lot of upsell
[01:08:29.240 --> 01:08:29.640]   at Hover.
[01:08:29.640 --> 01:08:32.800]   Hover is there to work with you to support you.
[01:08:32.800 --> 01:08:38.000]   They offer every domain name under the sun at a great price.
[01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:40.600]   What was the domain name I was looking for?
[01:08:40.600 --> 01:08:42.520]   The other day, oh, ish.
[01:08:42.520 --> 01:08:48.000]   So I found the ish domain registrar,
[01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:51.360]   which is I can't remember the island somewhere.
[01:08:51.360 --> 01:08:55.120]   And they have all this upsell and all this stuff.
[01:08:55.120 --> 01:08:57.480]   And then somebody in the chair said, you know, Hover's got it.
[01:08:57.480 --> 01:08:58.960]   I thought, of course, Hover's got it.
[01:08:58.960 --> 01:09:00.320]   I should have just got to Hover.
[01:09:00.320 --> 01:09:03.440]   Went there, bought Leo-ish.
[01:09:03.440 --> 01:09:04.400]   I don't know, it's sh.
[01:09:04.400 --> 01:09:05.240]   This is what it was.
[01:09:05.240 --> 01:09:06.400]   It's sh.
[01:09:06.400 --> 01:09:10.440]   And so I bought l-e-o-i.sh.
[01:09:10.440 --> 01:09:12.040]   I don't know if I'll really be able to use that.
[01:09:12.040 --> 01:09:15.360]   But anyway, the sh registrar was not great.
[01:09:15.360 --> 01:09:16.040]   Hover had it.
[01:09:16.040 --> 01:09:16.680]   It was easy.
[01:09:16.680 --> 01:09:19.720]   In fact, now I'm thinking of all sorts of extensions
[01:09:19.720 --> 01:09:22.200]   I could use to make some fun domain names.
[01:09:22.200 --> 01:09:25.000]   Every single time you go to Hover,
[01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:27.320]   you get free who is privacy protection.
[01:09:27.320 --> 01:09:32.080]   You get a very clean, easy to navigate user interface.
[01:09:32.080 --> 01:09:35.440]   They have a very simple DNS setup.
[01:09:35.440 --> 01:09:37.360]   In fact, they even have one click buttons
[01:09:37.360 --> 01:09:40.160]   for almost all the major blogging platforms, platforms
[01:09:40.160 --> 01:09:40.880]   like that.
[01:09:40.880 --> 01:09:44.360]   But I often go in and do custom domain name stuff.
[01:09:44.360 --> 01:09:46.200]   And it's so easy on Hover.
[01:09:46.200 --> 01:09:49.440]   Plus, you should always check Hover.com for their monthly sales.
[01:09:49.440 --> 01:09:53.520]   They have amazing sales on TLDs every single month.
[01:09:53.520 --> 01:09:54.880]   I think it's really important.
[01:09:54.880 --> 01:09:56.840]   And I recommend this all the time.
[01:09:56.840 --> 01:10:00.040]   If you're getting somebody to design a site for you,
[01:10:00.040 --> 01:10:01.920]   don't let them register the domain name.
[01:10:01.920 --> 01:10:04.080]   You register it yourself at Hover and say,
[01:10:04.080 --> 01:10:05.840]   here, this is the domain name to use.
[01:10:05.840 --> 01:10:07.280]   You want to keep it to yourself.
[01:10:07.280 --> 01:10:10.280]   Same thing goes if you're setting up a website
[01:10:10.280 --> 01:10:11.720]   with one of the web companies,
[01:10:11.720 --> 01:10:14.480]   a WordPress or Squarespace or Wix or whatever,
[01:10:14.480 --> 01:10:17.800]   you should absolutely not get it through them.
[01:10:17.800 --> 01:10:20.880]   You should get it yourself because then it's yours.
[01:10:20.880 --> 01:10:24.160]   It's decoupled from the hosting company.
[01:10:24.160 --> 01:10:25.640]   So if you decide to move hosts,
[01:10:25.640 --> 01:10:27.840]   you don't have to do anything but change the DNS.
[01:10:27.840 --> 01:10:29.160]   It's really easy.
[01:10:29.160 --> 01:10:29.800]   That's what I do.
[01:10:29.800 --> 01:10:30.800]   I highly recommend it.
[01:10:30.800 --> 01:10:32.160]   Get a domain name.
[01:10:32.160 --> 01:10:34.200]   Get a dozen domain names.
[01:10:34.200 --> 01:10:35.120]   Do like me.
[01:10:35.120 --> 01:10:37.800]   I have so many domain names that represents you
[01:10:37.800 --> 01:10:39.520]   and your passion.
[01:10:39.520 --> 01:10:43.320]   Visit Hover.com/twit to get 10% off your first purchase
[01:10:43.320 --> 01:10:46.560]   of any domain extension and that's for the whole first year.
[01:10:46.560 --> 01:10:51.400]   Hover hovir.com/twit.
[01:10:51.400 --> 01:10:53.240]   This is one of our,
[01:10:53.240 --> 01:10:55.160]   actually I would say many of our sponsors
[01:10:55.160 --> 01:10:56.640]   I'm a regular customer of,
[01:10:56.640 --> 01:11:00.560]   but this is one where I just go back time and time again.
[01:11:00.560 --> 01:11:02.680]   What did I get?
[01:11:02.680 --> 01:11:04.400]   I got Leoish and I think I got Twittish.
[01:11:04.400 --> 01:11:06.000]   (laughing)
[01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:06.840]   But there's no way,
[01:11:06.840 --> 01:11:08.600]   the problem is the eyes before the period.
[01:11:08.600 --> 01:11:13.240]   So I'm thinking L, capital LEO, lowercase i.n,
[01:11:13.240 --> 01:11:14.120]   S-H.
[01:11:14.120 --> 01:11:16.600]   Do you think people would be able to figure that out?
[01:11:16.600 --> 01:11:18.200]   I don't know.
[01:11:18.200 --> 01:11:20.840]   Hover.com/twit.
[01:11:20.840 --> 01:11:23.880]   There's so many domain names, so much fun.
[01:11:23.880 --> 01:11:27.640]   So we talked last week about the Google Apple plan
[01:11:27.640 --> 01:11:30.400]   to help with COVID tracing.
[01:11:30.400 --> 01:11:34.720]   As we get closer to that time where people are going to start
[01:11:34.720 --> 01:11:37.040]   to come out of their houses and tracing and quarantining
[01:11:37.040 --> 01:11:39.440]   becomes the order of the day and that may go on
[01:11:39.440 --> 01:11:41.000]   for a long time.
[01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:46.000]   It becomes really important that any system that we use
[01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:48.200]   protects our privacy, right?
[01:11:48.200 --> 01:11:51.200]   No one wants a system that once in place,
[01:11:51.200 --> 01:11:54.600]   the government conveniently forgets to stop doing it now.
[01:11:54.600 --> 01:11:56.160]   - There's been a bunch of other countries apparently.
[01:11:56.160 --> 01:11:57.960]   - Yeah, well, and that's one of the points
[01:11:57.960 --> 01:12:02.240]   I'm gonna make, France has created something.
[01:12:02.240 --> 01:12:06.400]   And they're mad at Apple because Apple's Bluetooth policy
[01:12:06.400 --> 01:12:09.800]   prohibits them from doing what they wanna do.
[01:12:09.800 --> 01:12:11.720]   And you know what I have to say to that?
[01:12:11.720 --> 01:12:14.000]   Bully for Apple, right on.
[01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:17.480]   (speaking in foreign language)
[01:12:17.480 --> 01:12:19.760]   France has actually gone to Apple to ask them
[01:12:19.760 --> 01:12:23.120]   to remove this obstacle, saying you're delaying
[01:12:23.120 --> 01:12:26.520]   a government contact-chasing application,
[01:12:26.520 --> 01:12:31.520]   but Apple specifically prevents contact tracing apps
[01:12:31.520 --> 01:12:33.480]   from running in the background.
[01:12:33.480 --> 01:12:37.520]   If, and here's the big if, you can run in the background,
[01:12:37.520 --> 01:12:41.200]   but you may not exfiltrate that data.
[01:12:41.200 --> 01:12:43.840]   If the data's gonna be moved off device,
[01:12:43.840 --> 01:12:47.920]   uh-uh, and that's for our privacy.
[01:12:47.920 --> 01:12:51.360]   That's so, and right on, okay?
[01:12:51.360 --> 01:12:54.720]   - And they're like, have you seen the French Riviera,
[01:12:54.720 --> 01:12:55.880]   there is no privacy?
[01:12:55.880 --> 01:12:57.720]   (laughing)
[01:12:57.720 --> 01:12:58.880]   Whatever, French.
[01:12:58.880 --> 01:13:01.280]   - I don't know what to say about this.
[01:13:01.280 --> 01:13:03.160]   You know, we have to always balance the fact
[01:13:03.160 --> 01:13:05.920]   that we need this public health measure is very important.
[01:13:05.920 --> 01:13:09.600]   And in cases like, you know, the crisis we're in,
[01:13:09.600 --> 01:13:12.840]   a lot of the traditional rules take a back seat
[01:13:12.840 --> 01:13:14.600]   to public health, that's as it should be.
[01:13:14.600 --> 01:13:15.840]   We don't want anybody to die.
[01:13:15.840 --> 01:13:18.000]   - And he corrected me last week when I was saying,
[01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:20.000]   you know, I'd much rather have, in an ideal world,
[01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:21.760]   if, if Jed Bartlett was president,
[01:13:21.760 --> 01:13:22.960]   if it was the West Wing,
[01:13:22.960 --> 01:13:24.920]   I would much rather have governments doing this
[01:13:24.920 --> 01:13:27.360]   than companies, but he reminded me I don't live in that world.
[01:13:27.360 --> 01:13:29.240]   I live in a world where the government is like,
[01:13:29.240 --> 01:13:30.680]   Ed Snowden's government.
[01:13:30.680 --> 01:13:33.320]   And this, I think he made a very salient point last week
[01:13:33.320 --> 01:13:35.280]   when he told me that it's much better right now
[01:13:35.280 --> 01:13:37.680]   to trust Apple and Google than it is to trust governments.
[01:13:37.680 --> 01:13:39.000]   Sadly. - Yeah.
[01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:40.960]   - It could be a game changer though.
[01:13:40.960 --> 01:13:44.280]   What a big shift could happen if let's say that
[01:13:44.280 --> 01:13:49.560]   governments decide to, or even local governments decide
[01:13:49.560 --> 01:13:53.080]   that there is an inferior standard, but it's a standard
[01:13:53.080 --> 01:13:57.320]   for creating some sort of a digital passport that says
[01:13:57.320 --> 01:13:59.960]   that by the way, this person has recently been tested
[01:13:59.960 --> 01:14:02.200]   for COVID-19, they've tested negative.
[01:14:02.200 --> 01:14:05.200]   Also, they have not been near anybody who has been
[01:14:05.200 --> 01:14:07.720]   who has tested positive for COVID-19.
[01:14:07.720 --> 01:14:09.920]   And it drops a digital certificate on your phone.
[01:14:09.920 --> 01:14:13.600]   And if you have that digital certificate on your phone,
[01:14:13.600 --> 01:14:16.160]   then you can tap into the mall,
[01:14:16.160 --> 01:14:21.160]   you can tap into the library or bars or whatever.
[01:14:21.160 --> 01:14:24.960]   And that past becomes, at least for the next year or two,
[01:14:24.960 --> 01:14:28.720]   what enables people to sort of loosen these restrictions.
[01:14:28.720 --> 01:14:31.480]   And what happens if some phones can support this
[01:14:31.480 --> 01:14:33.320]   and some can't?
[01:14:33.320 --> 01:14:36.960]   We're both talking about how it would make it difficult
[01:14:36.960 --> 01:14:40.920]   for certain manufacturers to maintain privacy controls
[01:14:40.920 --> 01:14:42.000]   and others not to.
[01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:45.680]   It would also widen a digital divide between people
[01:14:45.680 --> 01:14:48.720]   who have the sort of phones that support Bluetooth LE
[01:14:48.720 --> 01:14:51.840]   that support NFC, things that we might take for granted
[01:14:51.840 --> 01:14:53.800]   in any phone for the past two or three years,
[01:14:53.800 --> 01:14:57.000]   but would shut out people who are very, very grateful
[01:14:57.000 --> 01:15:00.320]   and lucky that someone gave them their father
[01:15:00.320 --> 01:15:03.240]   or their brother or sister gave them their old iPhone 4
[01:15:03.240 --> 01:15:04.960]   or the crack screen at all.
[01:15:04.960 --> 01:15:06.880]   - One thing France has that we don't have
[01:15:06.880 --> 01:15:11.280]   is a privacy watchdog and they have not yet reviewed the app.
[01:15:11.280 --> 01:15:14.960]   So there may be other non-starters in there as well.
[01:15:14.960 --> 01:15:16.760]   The French branch of the human rights league
[01:15:16.760 --> 01:15:19.360]   I'm reading from Mark German's story in Bloomberg has said
[01:15:19.360 --> 01:15:21.800]   that any system put in place should be based on information
[01:15:21.800 --> 01:15:23.880]   that is easy to read and understand
[01:15:23.880 --> 01:15:28.800]   to allow citizens specific free and informed consent.
[01:15:28.800 --> 01:15:30.720]   And it says that's not the case
[01:15:30.720 --> 01:15:33.120]   given the technologies that are being debated today.
[01:15:33.120 --> 01:15:36.640]   So by the way, Steve Gibson last week,
[01:15:36.640 --> 01:15:38.720]   on Tuesday right after Mac Break Weekly,
[01:15:38.720 --> 01:15:41.480]   did a deep dive on the Apple Google proposal.
[01:15:41.480 --> 01:15:45.880]   He read all the white papers and he felt very confident
[01:15:45.880 --> 01:15:48.920]   that it was possible to do it, respect privacy,
[01:15:48.920 --> 01:15:50.720]   to do it right, to anonymize it.
[01:15:50.720 --> 01:15:53.560]   He said, "Moxie Marlin Spike's concerns about it,"
[01:15:53.560 --> 01:15:58.000]   which we had referred to, were unfounded,
[01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:01.200]   that in fact it was a very, it was a well-designed technology.
[01:16:01.200 --> 01:16:04.760]   So they had Bud Trouble and they Google VP on Ed Begg's segment
[01:16:04.760 --> 01:16:06.920]   on CBS News over the weekend.
[01:16:06.920 --> 01:16:08.680]   I thought it was just interesting.
[01:16:08.680 --> 01:16:11.640]   It was not quite Bill Gates on the big screen
[01:16:11.640 --> 01:16:14.600]   behind Steve Jobs, it was a very smaller version of that,
[01:16:14.600 --> 01:16:16.440]   but it was still really interesting to see people
[01:16:16.440 --> 01:16:18.560]   of that level of those two companies
[01:16:18.560 --> 01:16:21.960]   with Ed Begg on CBS News talking about privacy,
[01:16:21.960 --> 01:16:23.320]   not the tracking app, the tracking app,
[01:16:23.320 --> 01:16:25.080]   I know people are gonna talk about the privacy aspect
[01:16:25.080 --> 01:16:25.920]   of the tracking app.
[01:16:25.920 --> 01:16:27.840]   - Yeah, well that's, look, we're gonna need a tracing.
[01:16:27.840 --> 01:16:29.040]   We're gonna need contact tracing.
[01:16:29.040 --> 01:16:30.200]   It's gotta have to happen.
[01:16:30.200 --> 01:16:33.040]   And there is some invasion of privacy.
[01:16:33.040 --> 01:16:35.320]   It may be that somebody comes to your door
[01:16:35.320 --> 01:16:36.880]   and sits you down and says, "Well, all right,
[01:16:36.880 --> 01:16:38.000]   you've got COVID-19.
[01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:39.600]   How many people did you interact with
[01:16:39.600 --> 01:16:40.640]   over the last two weeks?"
[01:16:40.640 --> 01:16:42.160]   And you'll have to go one by one.
[01:16:42.160 --> 01:16:43.480]   There's some people even suggesting
[01:16:43.480 --> 01:16:45.280]   that you start keeping a diary now,
[01:16:45.280 --> 01:16:47.680]   if you go out in public, of where you go
[01:16:47.680 --> 01:16:48.840]   and who you come in contact with.
[01:16:48.840 --> 01:16:50.160]   - It just doesn't work like the diary.
[01:16:50.160 --> 01:16:51.440]   - The diary just doesn't work because you don't know
[01:16:51.440 --> 01:16:53.120]   who's on the bus with you, you don't know who you passed
[01:16:53.120 --> 01:16:54.640]   and there's just no way for you to do it, man.
[01:16:54.640 --> 01:16:56.400]   - We have a technology to do it.
[01:16:56.400 --> 01:16:57.920]   By the way, it doesn't have to be universal.
[01:16:57.920 --> 01:17:00.480]   Admittedly, a lot of phones like that cracked iPhone 4
[01:17:00.480 --> 01:17:03.080]   won't work 'cause it doesn't have Bluetooth LE.
[01:17:03.080 --> 01:17:06.120]   But if you wanna reduce the R-naut,
[01:17:06.120 --> 01:17:08.000]   if you wanna reduce the spread,
[01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:10.400]   getting a large number of people to do it,
[01:17:10.400 --> 01:17:13.040]   even if it's not universal, helps
[01:17:13.040 --> 01:17:14.840]   and can in fact do the job.
[01:17:14.840 --> 01:17:16.280]   So it doesn't have to be perfect,
[01:17:16.280 --> 01:17:17.800]   but we have to have something.
[01:17:17.800 --> 01:17:20.040]   And I think we need something that can,
[01:17:20.040 --> 01:17:22.320]   technology may in fact give us something that works
[01:17:22.320 --> 01:17:24.160]   without invading our privacy.
[01:17:24.160 --> 01:17:26.000]   Naturally, government's not gonna wanna do that,
[01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:27.760]   but we gotta make 'em do that.
[01:17:27.760 --> 01:17:28.600]   - Yeah.
[01:17:28.600 --> 01:17:31.320]   - Well, Harvard just recently came out with a study
[01:17:31.320 --> 01:17:33.000]   or recommendation. - Yes, recommendation study, yeah.
[01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:34.520]   - Saying that here are the conditions
[01:17:34.520 --> 01:17:36.840]   in which we can start to open things up again.
[01:17:36.840 --> 01:17:39.440]   And it really does show how valuable just the ability
[01:17:39.440 --> 01:17:42.720]   of data acquisition and analysis is
[01:17:42.720 --> 01:17:45.640]   that even if you're not necessarily tracking individuals,
[01:17:45.640 --> 01:17:47.640]   if you can make sure that you at least know
[01:17:47.640 --> 01:17:49.760]   what the movement of people is like,
[01:17:49.760 --> 01:17:54.000]   and you can correlate that to the rate of diagnoses
[01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:58.240]   and you can up the rate of testing,
[01:17:58.240 --> 01:18:01.560]   then you can take a look at that curve in real time
[01:18:01.560 --> 01:18:03.800]   and decide that it is now safe,
[01:18:03.800 --> 01:18:06.160]   so long as you people aren't idiots
[01:18:06.160 --> 01:18:08.520]   and start having flag-waving cookouts
[01:18:08.520 --> 01:18:10.640]   on non- shortha July.
[01:18:10.640 --> 01:18:12.120]   - Oh, really? - I'm very doomed.
[01:18:12.120 --> 01:18:15.600]   - I'm just so disappointed that the government
[01:18:15.600 --> 01:18:18.640]   really does have to be like your mom or your dad,
[01:18:18.640 --> 01:18:21.200]   and everybody is like 12 years old saying,
[01:18:21.200 --> 01:18:24.280]   "Now, son, I really want you to step back and think
[01:18:24.280 --> 01:18:26.800]   about the fact that you're in the basement,
[01:18:26.800 --> 01:18:29.880]   you saw a video, and now you've poured alcohol
[01:18:29.880 --> 01:18:33.040]   on a countertop and you're about to light it and stick your--
[01:18:33.040 --> 01:18:34.280]   - Yeah. - Now, son,
[01:18:34.280 --> 01:18:36.320]   maybe we should, maybe you're not ready
[01:18:36.320 --> 01:18:38.440]   for responsibility just yet.
[01:18:38.440 --> 01:18:39.400]   - I have to say-- - You're not like
[01:18:39.400 --> 01:18:42.040]   asio or-- - Despite the outliers,
[01:18:42.040 --> 01:18:46.520]   and I was driving by apparently a wedding party
[01:18:46.520 --> 01:18:47.680]   where there were dozens of people
[01:18:47.680 --> 01:18:50.520]   all together at picnic tables the other day.
[01:18:50.520 --> 01:18:53.480]   So despite the outliers, I have to say,
[01:18:53.480 --> 01:18:57.280]   I'm really kind of blown away that of the vast majority
[01:18:57.280 --> 01:19:00.240]   of people all over the world are quarantining themselves.
[01:19:00.240 --> 01:19:02.720]   It's a huge hardship, it's an economic hardship
[01:19:02.720 --> 01:19:05.480]   for many people, it's a terrifying reality,
[01:19:05.480 --> 01:19:09.120]   but there's still doing it, and I think I'm kind of,
[01:19:09.120 --> 01:19:12.320]   it actually gave me some hope, to be honest with you.
[01:19:12.320 --> 01:19:14.400]   Yeah, there's plenty of dopes.
[01:19:14.400 --> 01:19:15.400]   - Yeah. - There's always getting sick.
[01:19:15.400 --> 01:19:16.440]   The dopes are getting sick,
[01:19:16.440 --> 01:19:17.920]   which is like a very good correlation.
[01:19:17.920 --> 01:19:19.520]   - Good news. - But you're not stopping.
[01:19:19.520 --> 01:19:22.320]   Darwin says, "Go on out, have some fun."
[01:19:22.320 --> 01:19:24.040]   (laughs)
[01:19:24.040 --> 01:19:26.080]   - Yeah, you're absolutely right.
[01:19:26.080 --> 01:19:28.920]   It was, it would've been impossible to imagine,
[01:19:28.920 --> 01:19:31.680]   even with we had just the raw data a year ago,
[01:19:31.680 --> 01:19:34.760]   let's say we have a hypothetical in which we have this disease,
[01:19:34.760 --> 01:19:36.560]   it's not killing a whole lot of people,
[01:19:36.560 --> 01:19:41.560]   but it has the potential to be one of those epic killers
[01:19:41.560 --> 01:19:46.440]   and worldwide, and based simply on trusting science
[01:19:46.440 --> 01:19:48.280]   and trusting our local governors.
[01:19:48.280 --> 01:19:49.120]   - That's a lot.
[01:19:49.120 --> 01:19:51.720]   - People decided to stay inside,
[01:19:51.720 --> 01:19:54.760]   and they weren't okay with businesses being shut down,
[01:19:54.760 --> 01:19:56.160]   but they didn't take to the streets,
[01:19:56.160 --> 01:19:58.200]   there was no need to call out the National Guard
[01:19:58.200 --> 01:19:59.680]   who maintained order. - Yeah, it's amazing.
[01:19:59.680 --> 01:20:01.520]   - It was like, wow. - Yeah, it's really,
[01:20:01.520 --> 01:20:04.200]   it's really, it's encouraging to me.
[01:20:04.200 --> 01:20:06.680]   - Did you see, I think, hopefully as an edge case.
[01:20:06.680 --> 01:20:09.080]   - Speaking of Mark Gurman, he also had a story,
[01:20:09.080 --> 01:20:12.080]   somebody leaked to him in all hands Apple meeting.
[01:20:12.080 --> 01:20:14.320]   I'm sure it was not over Zoom,
[01:20:14.320 --> 01:20:16.560]   but it couldn't have been FaceTime either, I don't know.
[01:20:16.560 --> 01:20:20.000]   - Do we know what Apple uses for their WebEx?
[01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:21.800]   - WebEx, you think so, Cisco?
[01:20:21.800 --> 01:20:23.120]   - Yeah. - I think they're WebEx,
[01:20:23.120 --> 01:20:24.520]   and I don't think they do Zoom,
[01:20:24.520 --> 01:20:26.480]   I think they do WebEx, I forget what the other one is.
[01:20:26.480 --> 01:20:28.600]   - I can pretty much guarantee they don't do Zoom.
[01:20:28.600 --> 01:20:31.520]   Although Zoom has, I think, gotten to be the,
[01:20:31.520 --> 01:20:33.280]   gotten to the point now where it's fine,
[01:20:33.280 --> 01:20:34.840]   let's go ahead and use it.
[01:20:34.840 --> 01:20:38.160]   Tim Cook said, "Don't worry, we got some money in the bank.
[01:20:38.160 --> 01:20:41.640]   We're, there's some concern, here's the quote,
[01:20:41.640 --> 01:20:43.920]   "If we stay focused on what we do best,
[01:20:43.920 --> 01:20:45.960]   if we keep investing, by the way,"
[01:20:45.960 --> 01:20:49.160]   he said they're making massive R&D investments right now.
[01:20:49.160 --> 01:20:50.840]   "If we manage the business wisely
[01:20:50.840 --> 01:20:52.360]   and make decisions collaboratively,
[01:20:52.360 --> 01:20:54.240]   if we take care of our teams,
[01:20:54.240 --> 01:20:56.000]   if our teams take care of their work,
[01:20:56.000 --> 01:21:00.080]   I don't see any reason to be anything but optimistic."
[01:21:00.080 --> 01:21:02.080]   Interesting.
[01:21:02.080 --> 01:21:04.520]   When asked about job cuts, he says,
[01:21:04.520 --> 01:21:07.600]   "We have a strong financial position.
[01:21:07.600 --> 01:21:10.080]   We're paying our retail employees while stores are closed.
[01:21:10.080 --> 01:21:12.440]   I won't tell you Apple won't be impacted."
[01:21:12.440 --> 01:21:15.400]   Cook said while stressing that his focus
[01:21:15.400 --> 01:21:17.720]   on running the company for the long term,
[01:21:17.720 --> 01:21:21.680]   rather than making short-term adjustments.
[01:21:21.680 --> 01:21:23.640]   Apple doesn't know when employees will be able to return
[01:21:23.640 --> 01:21:26.640]   to offices here in Northern California.
[01:21:26.640 --> 01:21:29.600]   We're at the same, you know, rough geographic area.
[01:21:29.600 --> 01:21:34.280]   I think the governor of California in general has said,
[01:21:34.280 --> 01:21:38.440]   "There's some real benchmarks before we go back to work."
[01:21:38.440 --> 01:21:40.720]   And that includes, by the way,
[01:21:40.720 --> 01:21:44.040]   testing, quarantine, and contact tracing,
[01:21:44.040 --> 01:21:45.400]   none of which is in place.
[01:21:45.400 --> 01:21:48.280]   So I think it's gonna be a while.
[01:21:48.280 --> 01:21:50.200]   Tim said when workers do go back,
[01:21:50.200 --> 01:21:52.200]   temperature checks and social distancing
[01:21:52.200 --> 01:21:53.920]   will likely be implemented.
[01:21:53.920 --> 01:21:56.560]   He said coronavirus testing is a possibility,
[01:21:56.560 --> 01:21:58.840]   but there aren't plans in place at the moment.
[01:21:58.840 --> 01:22:02.880]   So good news, Apple, you know,
[01:22:02.880 --> 01:22:05.160]   and Apple has the money to pay its employees,
[01:22:05.160 --> 01:22:07.280]   probably for several years.
[01:22:07.280 --> 01:22:09.360]   They have donated more than 30 million masks,
[01:22:09.360 --> 01:22:11.480]   two million of their new face shields.
[01:22:11.480 --> 01:22:13.880]   A whole bunch of them just arrived in Los Angeles.
[01:22:13.880 --> 01:22:16.600]   And contributed hundreds of millions of dollars
[01:22:16.600 --> 01:22:18.880]   to battling COVID-19.
[01:22:18.880 --> 01:22:21.360]   He said that the COVID-19 screening app
[01:22:21.360 --> 01:22:25.520]   that they put on the iPhone has been used millions of times.
[01:22:25.520 --> 01:22:30.640]   And for the first time, an Apple store outside of China
[01:22:30.640 --> 01:22:32.640]   has been reopened.
[01:22:32.640 --> 01:22:36.920]   They are going to reopen their Seoul, South Korea store.
[01:22:36.920 --> 01:22:38.720]   This will be the first one outside of China
[01:22:38.720 --> 01:22:40.840]   since this all began.
[01:22:40.840 --> 01:22:45.200]   So there's some progress being made.
[01:22:45.200 --> 01:22:47.720]   - Yeah, I'm glad they'll see a multi-billion dollar company
[01:22:47.720 --> 01:22:49.760]   that understands that this is hard,
[01:22:49.760 --> 01:22:53.360]   it's hard to argue that you can't afford to give
[01:22:53.360 --> 01:22:56.920]   from financial relief to your employees during this crisis.
[01:22:56.920 --> 01:22:58.400]   - Oh my God. - And this is,
[01:22:58.400 --> 01:23:00.000]   and this is what a great time
[01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:01.920]   for Amazon to be union busting.
[01:23:01.920 --> 01:23:03.560]   - Yeah. - There you go.
[01:23:03.560 --> 01:23:04.520]   - Or-- - Well, there was that whole
[01:23:04.520 --> 01:23:05.680]   Shake Shack in Great Christie.
[01:23:05.680 --> 01:23:06.680]   - Yeah. - It was Shake Shack
[01:23:06.680 --> 01:23:08.040]   giving back the money with Christie's like,
[01:23:08.040 --> 01:23:09.640]   "Nope, it's in the pocket, sorry!"
[01:23:09.640 --> 01:23:13.080]   Ruth's Chris Steakhouse and Harvard Unav--
[01:23:13.080 --> 01:23:14.080]   Excuse me.
[01:23:14.080 --> 01:23:16.680]   Unavirusity. (laughing)
[01:23:16.680 --> 01:23:18.080]   - I feel you, Leo, I feel you.
[01:23:18.080 --> 01:23:19.160]   - But you feel me? - Yeah.
[01:23:19.160 --> 01:23:21.480]   - Harvard has a massive endowment,
[01:23:21.480 --> 01:23:23.760]   hundreds of millions of dollars,
[01:23:23.760 --> 01:23:27.800]   and they're taking money from the small business loans
[01:23:27.800 --> 01:23:29.280]   that are supposed to save companies like mine.
[01:23:29.280 --> 01:23:32.240]   - We did. - And now there's no money left.
[01:23:32.240 --> 01:23:33.080]   Whoops.
[01:23:33.080 --> 01:23:35.960]   I'm sorry, I shouldn't get angry.
[01:23:35.960 --> 01:23:36.800]   Then I said, "No, you're a--"
[01:23:36.800 --> 01:23:37.640]   - No, you shouldn't get angry.
[01:23:37.640 --> 01:23:39.040]   - "You should be sitting there right to be hostile."
[01:23:39.040 --> 01:23:41.920]   - If it were you, maybe, but Harvard, come on!
[01:23:41.920 --> 01:23:42.760]   (laughing)
[01:23:42.760 --> 01:23:46.400]   - Come on, they need backs for their racing skulls.
[01:23:46.400 --> 01:23:47.240]   (laughing)
[01:23:47.240 --> 01:23:48.560]   What are they gonna do?
[01:23:48.560 --> 01:23:49.680]   Race them without wax?
[01:23:49.680 --> 01:23:51.800]   Come on, that's not a solution.
[01:23:51.800 --> 01:23:54.320]   - Tim Cook has been tapped for the California governor's
[01:23:54.320 --> 01:23:56.280]   business recovery task force.
[01:23:56.280 --> 01:23:59.720]   I think that's a wise choice, governor Newsom.
[01:23:59.720 --> 01:24:01.800]   He seems like he knows a little bit about business.
[01:24:01.800 --> 01:24:03.400]   He knows what he's doing.
[01:24:03.400 --> 01:24:06.400]   Just a little bit Bob Iger from a former Disney CEO
[01:24:06.400 --> 01:24:07.480]   who's found something to do.
[01:24:07.480 --> 01:24:08.760]   Actually, wasn't it?
[01:24:08.760 --> 01:24:12.160]   I read that Bob, who had just kind of retired
[01:24:12.160 --> 01:24:16.320]   and headed over the reins of Disney, said,
[01:24:16.320 --> 01:24:17.800]   "Now out of the way, I'm back."
[01:24:17.800 --> 01:24:18.640]   (laughing)
[01:24:18.640 --> 01:24:19.480]   We got a problem.
[01:24:19.480 --> 01:24:21.080]   The talk was that he left quickly
[01:24:21.080 --> 01:24:22.960]   because he knew that this was gonna hit.
[01:24:22.960 --> 01:24:25.560]   So maybe hindsight, it was like,
[01:24:25.560 --> 01:24:27.760]   "Oh, no, maybe that wasn't my finest hour."
[01:24:27.760 --> 01:24:31.680]   - He did leave kind of precipitously, didn't he?
[01:24:31.680 --> 01:24:33.480]   - Unexpectedly, yeah.
[01:24:33.480 --> 01:24:34.480]   - Interesting.
[01:24:34.480 --> 01:24:38.640]   Well, I think he did announce that he was living.
[01:24:38.640 --> 01:24:41.760]   It's just that he left earlier than expected.
[01:24:41.760 --> 01:24:43.120]   And that was the-
[01:24:43.120 --> 01:24:44.680]   - 'Cause the virus is coming.
[01:24:44.680 --> 01:24:46.520]   - He didn't wanna be the one who had to close
[01:24:46.520 --> 01:24:47.880]   Disney World and Disneyland.
[01:24:47.880 --> 01:24:50.600]   That, you know, and those are closed for a long time.
[01:24:50.600 --> 01:24:53.360]   And the hotels, you can imagine Disney's burning
[01:24:53.360 --> 01:24:54.200]   through money pretty good.
[01:24:54.200 --> 01:24:57.920]   Fortunately, Disney Plus has many, many more subscribers
[01:24:57.920 --> 01:24:58.920]   than they expected.
[01:24:58.920 --> 01:25:01.760]   Probably does not make up for the loss.
[01:25:03.640 --> 01:25:06.200]   Apple's going up your way, gonna do some,
[01:25:06.200 --> 01:25:11.000]   they gave 20,000 iPads to the Ontario government, Renee.
[01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:12.200]   - Yeah, that's awesome.
[01:25:12.200 --> 01:25:13.520]   - With the help of Rogers,
[01:25:13.520 --> 01:25:15.720]   the big cable company up there.
[01:25:15.720 --> 01:25:17.280]   So yeah, that's great.
[01:25:17.280 --> 01:25:20.880]   20,000 iPads for teaching at home.
[01:25:20.880 --> 01:25:23.040]   They're also, as we, I think we mentioned,
[01:25:23.040 --> 01:25:25.960]   or maybe we didn't, the product red version
[01:25:25.960 --> 01:25:29.680]   of the iPhone SE proceeds go to COVID-19 and relief.
[01:25:29.680 --> 01:25:32.560]   Of course, product red traditionally went to AIDS relief.
[01:25:33.520 --> 01:25:36.880]   But for this period of time, they're gonna be
[01:25:36.880 --> 01:25:38.520]   donating it to COVID-19.
[01:25:38.520 --> 01:25:42.160]   And if you have an Apple card,
[01:25:42.160 --> 01:25:46.240]   you can defer March payments due to coronavirus,
[01:25:46.240 --> 01:25:48.040]   April as well.
[01:25:48.040 --> 01:25:51.440]   So start charging it up.
[01:25:51.440 --> 01:25:53.080]   No, no, don't, no.
[01:25:53.080 --> 01:25:53.920]   - Don't do that.
[01:25:53.920 --> 01:25:55.800]   - No, no, if you need it, I'm not,
[01:25:55.800 --> 01:25:57.440]   I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not.
[01:25:57.440 --> 01:25:58.920]   I'm not gonna do it, but if you,
[01:25:58.920 --> 01:26:00.000]   (laughing)
[01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:03.160]   if you need the money,
[01:26:03.160 --> 01:26:05.200]   here's some good news, you can defer those payments.
[01:26:05.200 --> 01:26:08.520]   That's again, exactly what you'd expect,
[01:26:08.520 --> 01:26:11.520]   and yet it seems kind of rare that companies do that.
[01:26:11.520 --> 01:26:12.600]   So thank you.
[01:26:12.600 --> 01:26:14.160]   - Character is revealed under adversity.
[01:26:14.160 --> 01:26:15.000]   - It is.
[01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:16.160]   - It's very, very chance.
[01:26:16.160 --> 01:26:17.520]   - And I've said this many times,
[01:26:17.520 --> 01:26:21.720]   but we will remember for many years
[01:26:21.720 --> 01:26:24.960]   how companies act during this time.
[01:26:24.960 --> 01:26:28.040]   - And managers at all scales of government business and,
[01:26:28.040 --> 01:26:29.400]   yeah.
[01:26:29.400 --> 01:26:30.800]   - Yeah, I'll come out and say it,
[01:26:30.800 --> 01:26:32.720]   I've been doing more purchasing on,
[01:26:32.720 --> 01:26:35.000]   when I need things on eBay than on Amazon.
[01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:37.680]   Not even, even when there isn't like a two week delay,
[01:26:37.680 --> 01:26:39.440]   just the idea that if I buy,
[01:26:39.440 --> 01:26:41.120]   if the price is roughly the same,
[01:26:41.120 --> 01:26:43.000]   this is an actual retailer that,
[01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:44.200]   not just an individual,
[01:26:44.200 --> 01:26:47.040]   and also the idea that this person is probably running
[01:26:47.040 --> 01:26:48.840]   their own shop and they're probably,
[01:26:48.840 --> 01:26:51.400]   they're probably not making their employees sick
[01:26:51.400 --> 01:26:54.760]   by making them work on godly hours,
[01:26:54.760 --> 01:26:57.400]   under ungodly pressure without PPE.
[01:26:57.400 --> 01:27:01.160]   This, like Renee said, that this is, oh boy,
[01:27:01.160 --> 01:27:02.520]   their World War II ends,
[01:27:02.520 --> 01:27:04.280]   and then you spend the next two or three years,
[01:27:04.280 --> 01:27:07.040]   okay, you know how you sold all that artwork
[01:27:07.040 --> 01:27:10.280]   to the Nazis that you got from the sources?
[01:27:10.280 --> 01:27:11.960]   And you know how you were kind of saying,
[01:27:11.960 --> 01:27:13.440]   hey, let's appease these people,
[01:27:13.440 --> 01:27:16.800]   and now you're marching with a liberation flag.
[01:27:16.800 --> 01:27:19.760]   Let's touch back on that now, yeah.
[01:27:19.760 --> 01:27:23.000]   - Here I am sitting on a Linux machine,
[01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:25.160]   listening to Apple music.
[01:27:25.160 --> 01:27:26.560]   Who the fuck it?
[01:27:26.560 --> 01:27:27.840]   (laughing)
[01:27:27.840 --> 01:27:31.040]   - The worldwide web version of Apple music.
[01:27:31.040 --> 01:27:32.720]   I've been using it and I've been loving it.
[01:27:32.720 --> 01:27:34.160]   If you have an Apple music subscription,
[01:27:34.160 --> 01:27:35.560]   I haven't signed in here yet.
[01:27:35.560 --> 01:27:37.400]   You can sign in, it's out of beta.
[01:27:37.400 --> 01:27:40.280]   And-- - And it's high on life.
[01:27:40.280 --> 01:27:41.160]   - It's high on life.
[01:27:41.160 --> 01:27:42.560]   There are other systems.
[01:27:42.560 --> 01:27:44.480]   I mean, I have a number of music subscriptions,
[01:27:44.480 --> 01:27:47.000]   including Google's, Google music,
[01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:49.480]   now YouTube music that play fine on a browser.
[01:27:49.480 --> 01:27:51.480]   But it's nice, if you're using,
[01:27:51.480 --> 01:27:53.640]   you know, as I often do Linux,
[01:27:54.840 --> 01:27:56.920]   it's nice to be able to play streaming music
[01:27:56.920 --> 01:27:59.320]   from commercial sources.
[01:27:59.320 --> 01:28:00.640]   I wanted to hear the new,
[01:28:00.640 --> 01:28:05.280]   what's your name? (laughing)
[01:28:05.280 --> 01:28:06.320]   - Album.
[01:28:06.320 --> 01:28:08.160]   - And you know what's her name?
[01:28:08.160 --> 01:28:09.080]   She's great. - Joan Apple?
[01:28:09.080 --> 01:28:12.080]   - Yeah, how did you know Fiona Apple was the one that I think?
[01:28:12.080 --> 01:28:13.800]   - Is she related to Tim Apple?
[01:28:13.800 --> 01:28:15.160]   I'm the first one to make that joke.
[01:28:15.160 --> 01:28:16.480]   (laughing)
[01:28:16.480 --> 01:28:18.760]   - I'm impressed, Andy, you knew, you knew.
[01:28:18.760 --> 01:28:21.880]   - Because Fiona Apple is like all the entire,
[01:28:21.880 --> 01:28:23.240]   it's either gonna be,
[01:28:23.240 --> 01:28:25.720]   it would have been either her or Bob Dylan,
[01:28:25.720 --> 01:28:28.040]   but Bob Dylan has only been releasing 10 minute tracks,
[01:28:28.040 --> 01:28:29.120]   not whole album yet.
[01:28:29.120 --> 01:28:32.800]   The Fiona, new Fiona Apple album is quite wonderful.
[01:28:32.800 --> 01:28:34.160]   I haven't thought about her in years,
[01:28:34.160 --> 01:28:35.400]   but now like, oh my God, what happened?
[01:28:35.400 --> 01:28:36.240]   I thought about her.
[01:28:36.240 --> 01:28:37.560]   - I think about her all the time,
[01:28:37.560 --> 01:28:38.720]   'cause I play her music all the time.
[01:28:38.720 --> 01:28:41.520]   I love her kind of quirky sound.
[01:28:41.520 --> 01:28:42.360]   I think she's really good.
[01:28:42.360 --> 01:28:43.360]   And the new album is--
[01:28:43.360 --> 01:28:45.520]   - One of the Apple commercials, a long time ago.
[01:28:45.520 --> 01:28:48.880]   - The new album is appropriately named Fetch the Bolt Cutters.
[01:28:48.880 --> 01:28:51.160]   (laughing)
[01:28:51.160 --> 01:28:53.800]   I don't think, I don't know if it's related to COVID or not.
[01:28:53.800 --> 01:28:57.280]   It sounds like it's more related to a bad relationship.
[01:28:57.280 --> 01:29:00.400]   Still, you can apply it to whatever you want.
[01:29:00.400 --> 01:29:02.240]   And look at this, it's completed in Linux,
[01:29:02.240 --> 01:29:03.960]   right here on my computer.
[01:29:03.960 --> 01:29:05.240]   It's an amazing thing.
[01:29:05.240 --> 01:29:06.800]   - Like God and nature intended.
[01:29:06.800 --> 01:29:08.740]   - What a wild, what a wild.
[01:29:08.740 --> 01:29:11.920]   Let's see, what other news here?
[01:29:11.920 --> 01:29:12.920]   We'll go through a couple of them.
[01:29:12.920 --> 01:29:16.840]   Oh, Apple's rumored over the ear headphones.
[01:29:16.840 --> 01:29:19.000]   There's another rumor about these.
[01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:22.920]   I wonder, we've talked before about Apple and Beats.
[01:29:22.920 --> 01:29:25.360]   I'm starting to think Apple might be thinking about
[01:29:25.360 --> 01:29:28.320]   just kind of replacing Beats and becoming--
[01:29:28.320 --> 01:29:29.520]   - That's what processors rumors said
[01:29:29.520 --> 01:29:32.000]   when he started talking about the studio pods,
[01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:33.000]   which actually sounded interesting
[01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:35.040]   because they're apparently gonna be component,
[01:29:35.040 --> 01:29:37.120]   like you'll be able to take off one thing
[01:29:37.120 --> 01:29:38.840]   and put another, but he said that it was an effort
[01:29:38.840 --> 01:29:40.600]   to phase out Beats and then nine to five said,
[01:29:40.600 --> 01:29:42.320]   no, Beats is not going anywhere.
[01:29:42.320 --> 01:29:44.680]   But I've got to think that the AirPods
[01:29:44.680 --> 01:29:46.560]   were an unprecedented hit for Apple.
[01:29:46.560 --> 01:29:49.080]   Like they had Beats and Beats were super popular,
[01:29:49.080 --> 01:29:50.280]   which is why they kept Beats.
[01:29:50.280 --> 01:29:51.160]   You know, nobody went to the store
[01:29:51.160 --> 01:29:53.760]   and thought I've got to get EarPods, the old EarPods.
[01:29:53.760 --> 01:29:57.760]   But then AirPods came out and they sold so many more
[01:29:57.760 --> 01:30:00.040]   than they expected to and it became a phenomenon.
[01:30:00.040 --> 01:30:03.480]   And now they've built on that with AirPods Pro
[01:30:03.480 --> 01:30:05.280]   and now these studio pods, whatever they're called,
[01:30:05.280 --> 01:30:06.360]   are gonna build on that.
[01:30:06.360 --> 01:30:08.240]   And I might get to a point where Apple is just
[01:30:08.240 --> 01:30:11.880]   outselling Beats so much that the value of that brand
[01:30:11.880 --> 01:30:13.280]   isn't as high for them.
[01:30:13.280 --> 01:30:15.480]   The only way I can see them sticking around is that
[01:30:15.480 --> 01:30:16.920]   they do all sorts of novelty stuff,
[01:30:16.920 --> 01:30:19.320]   like the Mickey Mouse Beats and the Olympic Beats.
[01:30:19.320 --> 01:30:21.280]   I don't think we'd ever see Mickey Mouse EarPods.
[01:30:21.280 --> 01:30:22.120]   - Apple doesn't wanna do Mickey Mouse EarPods.
[01:30:22.120 --> 01:30:24.800]   - Yeah, so if they wanna keep doing that kind of stuff,
[01:30:24.800 --> 01:30:26.600]   I could see it, but otherwise I think AirPods
[01:30:26.600 --> 01:30:29.480]   is just gonna keep eating away at the Beats lineup.
[01:30:29.480 --> 01:30:31.040]   - And these new over the ear headphones
[01:30:31.040 --> 01:30:34.240]   are right up against what Beats does, right?
[01:30:34.240 --> 01:30:35.400]   High-end headphones.
[01:30:35.400 --> 01:30:36.240]   - High-end.
[01:30:36.240 --> 01:30:38.880]   - Oh Beats is not high-end?
[01:30:38.880 --> 01:30:40.560]   Beats is expensive.
[01:30:40.560 --> 01:30:43.360]   - They're a very wide spectrum.
[01:30:43.360 --> 01:30:48.000]   Also, I think the presence of Beats allows Apple
[01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:52.080]   to do things that they would find extremely distasteful,
[01:30:52.080 --> 01:30:54.600]   such as create a pair of headphones
[01:30:54.600 --> 01:30:58.320]   that creates highly distorted and weird sound
[01:30:58.320 --> 01:31:00.160]   that nonetheless a lot of people like.
[01:31:00.160 --> 01:31:01.240]   - It's quite appealing.
[01:31:01.240 --> 01:31:02.720]   It's kind of like those.
[01:31:02.720 --> 01:31:03.560]   - Yeah.
[01:31:03.560 --> 01:31:06.480]   - It's like, and it's already a successful brand.
[01:31:06.480 --> 01:31:08.840]   I think that they'll keep Beats as a brand
[01:31:08.840 --> 01:31:12.360]   until they can't, it becomes a handicap rather
[01:31:12.360 --> 01:31:14.520]   than a positive.
[01:31:14.520 --> 01:31:16.800]   I don't see them getting rid of Beats anytime soon.
[01:31:16.800 --> 01:31:18.480]   - So maybe Beats will go to the low end
[01:31:18.480 --> 01:31:21.600]   and the Disney headphones,
[01:31:21.600 --> 01:31:24.560]   and Apple will do the high fidelity headphones,
[01:31:24.560 --> 01:31:27.000]   or the technically sophisticated headphones
[01:31:27.000 --> 01:31:28.240]   like the AirPods.
[01:31:28.240 --> 01:31:30.360]   The rumor, according to German,
[01:31:30.360 --> 01:31:32.400]   is that they will sell these for around.
[01:31:32.400 --> 01:31:34.800]   Well, to compete with Bose and Sennheiser and Sony,
[01:31:34.800 --> 01:31:37.080]   which sell headphones in the mid 300s,
[01:31:37.080 --> 01:31:39.920]   I don't consider, I mean, there are three-hundred
[01:31:39.920 --> 01:31:44.640]   - It's not like the 1500 dollar ones that Leo would wear
[01:31:44.640 --> 01:31:46.840]   that would create a complete reference environment
[01:31:46.840 --> 01:31:48.040]   around his head like.
[01:31:48.040 --> 01:31:48.960]   - You know what?
[01:31:48.960 --> 01:31:52.600]   Buying good headphones is cheaper than buying a fancy stereo.
[01:31:52.600 --> 01:31:54.080]   - You can spend unlimited money on audio.
[01:31:54.080 --> 01:31:55.000]   I was looking at some of the,
[01:31:55.000 --> 01:31:56.640]   and it's just like, you get to the millions
[01:31:56.640 --> 01:31:57.920]   and you keep going with the speakers,
[01:31:57.920 --> 01:31:59.520]   a million bucks, get me too.
[01:31:59.520 --> 01:32:02.560]   - So we had, we did our 15th anniversary
[01:32:02.560 --> 01:32:04.720]   tweet on Sunday with Kevin Rose.
[01:32:04.720 --> 01:32:05.560]   - Congratulations.
[01:32:05.560 --> 01:32:07.400]   - And Robert Herron, yeah, it was really cool.
[01:32:07.400 --> 01:32:11.880]   And Patrick Norton, and we got talking about music.
[01:32:11.880 --> 01:32:13.680]   And you know, Patrick's a big headphone guy.
[01:32:13.680 --> 01:32:16.080]   He recommended some thousand dollar headphones.
[01:32:16.080 --> 01:32:17.880]   But Kevin topped him all.
[01:32:17.880 --> 01:32:21.280]   He said, well, I have a hand built stereo.
[01:32:21.280 --> 01:32:22.960]   (laughs)
[01:32:22.960 --> 01:32:25.120]   Do you remember the link for that, John?
[01:32:25.120 --> 01:32:26.320]   I can't remember the link.
[01:32:26.320 --> 01:32:28.000]   It's probably in my history here somewhere.
[01:32:28.000 --> 01:32:29.600]   I should go back in my history.
[01:32:29.600 --> 01:32:32.120]   But it was handmade.
[01:32:32.120 --> 01:32:33.800]   It had a turntable.
[01:32:33.800 --> 01:32:35.440]   It had a tube amp.
[01:32:35.440 --> 01:32:37.200]   It had built-in speakers.
[01:32:37.200 --> 01:32:39.760]   It was about 15 feet wide.
[01:32:39.760 --> 01:32:43.040]   For, it started at $20,000.
[01:32:43.040 --> 01:32:43.880]   - Yeah.
[01:32:43.880 --> 01:32:45.280]   - And unbelievable, the amount of money they've-
[01:32:45.280 --> 01:32:47.760]   - Final albums not included, right?
[01:32:47.760 --> 01:32:48.600]   Was this simple?
[01:32:48.600 --> 01:32:49.920]   - I think Linus had one of those companies on
[01:32:49.920 --> 01:32:51.120]   that brought like these headphones
[01:32:51.120 --> 01:32:52.120]   that looked like one of the-
[01:32:52.120 --> 01:32:52.960]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:32:52.960 --> 01:32:55.420]   - The cyber
[01:32:55.420 --> 01:32:56.260]   - Yeah. - from Dr. Hu.
[01:32:56.260 --> 01:32:57.100]   And then like, and you had to have a special amp.
[01:32:57.100 --> 01:32:57.940]   And then another, like you had to have like,
[01:32:57.940 --> 01:32:59.360]   I forget what it was, like 80 grand worth of stuff.
[01:32:59.360 --> 01:33:00.560]   Just to drive the thing.
[01:33:00.560 --> 01:33:01.720]   - Isn't that a stereo?
[01:33:01.720 --> 01:33:06.000]   Here it is, the modern record console from symbol audio.
[01:33:06.000 --> 01:33:07.520]   But it's beautiful, isn't it?
[01:33:07.520 --> 01:33:08.360]   - It is.
[01:33:08.360 --> 01:33:09.520]   - Look at that. - Oh, look at that.
[01:33:09.520 --> 01:33:11.680]   - And look at the tubes.
[01:33:11.680 --> 01:33:13.760]   I told him if I had 20 grand to burn,
[01:33:13.760 --> 01:33:17.600]   I would burn it on this, but I don't.
[01:33:17.600 --> 01:33:18.920]   - Wow.
[01:33:18.920 --> 01:33:21.120]   I know what I'm spending all that money I've been saving on.
[01:33:21.120 --> 01:33:22.560]   No more cars for me.
[01:33:22.560 --> 01:33:23.400]   - That's true.
[01:33:23.400 --> 01:33:25.320]   No more cars less than a car, right?
[01:33:25.320 --> 01:33:26.320]   - Yeah.
[01:33:26.320 --> 01:33:27.160]   - About the same.
[01:33:27.160 --> 01:33:28.000]   - Doesn't have a half-bout.
[01:33:28.000 --> 01:33:28.840]   - Yeah, that is pretty.
[01:33:28.840 --> 01:33:31.280]   - So gorgeous.
[01:33:31.280 --> 01:33:32.120]   He says it sounds really good.
[01:33:32.120 --> 01:33:33.960]   - Same thing I saw a YouTuber with a red camera saying,
[01:33:33.960 --> 01:33:35.720]   look, I'm just gonna pick up the value of two cars
[01:33:35.720 --> 01:33:37.160]   and carry it down the street, no big deal.
[01:33:37.160 --> 01:33:38.000]   - No big deal.
[01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:38.840]   - Not so much the difference.
[01:33:38.840 --> 01:33:40.120]   - And look at this, you might like this,
[01:33:40.120 --> 01:33:43.120]   Lori wireless streaming Bluetooth AirPlay.
[01:33:43.120 --> 01:33:46.360]   It supports Sonos and Chromecast audio.
[01:33:46.360 --> 01:33:49.640]   So you're not left out of the modern age.
[01:33:49.640 --> 01:33:53.160]   It just sounds like you're from the '50s.
[01:33:53.160 --> 01:33:55.360]   - Is it really a two-band?
[01:33:55.360 --> 01:33:56.200]   - Yes.
[01:33:56.200 --> 01:33:57.040]   - Or are those there for looks?
[01:33:57.040 --> 01:33:59.680]   - No, it's all handmade.
[01:33:59.680 --> 01:34:01.600]   He says it's probably one of his neighbors.
[01:34:01.600 --> 01:34:02.920]   Yeah.
[01:34:02.920 --> 01:34:05.440]   - Wow. - And look at the meters.
[01:34:05.440 --> 01:34:06.280]   - Oh.
[01:34:06.280 --> 01:34:10.240]   - I will say that I am a fan of like clicky buttons
[01:34:10.240 --> 01:34:12.400]   and knobs and view meters.
[01:34:12.400 --> 01:34:14.280]   The number of times I've been on eBay
[01:34:14.280 --> 01:34:17.320]   looking at like a pioneer amp from the 1980s
[01:34:17.320 --> 01:34:20.280]   just for those blue fluorescent like indicators
[01:34:20.280 --> 01:34:23.120]   and view meters before realizing that you're about to spend,
[01:34:23.120 --> 01:34:26.400]   you would be spending $180 on something
[01:34:26.400 --> 01:34:29.160]   that you could probably build with a Raspberry Pi
[01:34:29.160 --> 01:34:30.600]   for if you just want like,
[01:34:30.600 --> 01:34:33.360]   Dinkus is on the screen, you could build a screen like that.
[01:34:33.360 --> 01:34:34.720]   Dinkus is on the screen.
[01:34:34.720 --> 01:34:35.560]   (laughing)
[01:34:35.560 --> 01:34:37.960]   - I love, I love, I got one of these
[01:34:37.960 --> 01:34:39.320]   - Shout out to Dinkus is on the screen.
[01:34:39.320 --> 01:34:40.160]   - Yeah.
[01:34:40.160 --> 01:34:41.520]   - I will, that's on my mind
[01:34:41.520 --> 01:34:46.520]   'cause my current form of like quarantine crazy
[01:34:46.520 --> 01:34:49.320]   is like buying taper quarters on eBay
[01:34:49.320 --> 01:34:51.960]   that look really, really awesome and cool.
[01:34:51.960 --> 01:34:54.040]   Probably partly because they just,
[01:34:54.040 --> 01:34:55.560]   it was just a weird,
[01:34:55.560 --> 01:34:57.840]   the idea that you don't have to have one design
[01:34:57.840 --> 01:35:00.400]   for everything that you're trying to convince
[01:35:00.400 --> 01:35:02.440]   all of these executives to buy a note taker
[01:35:02.440 --> 01:35:04.320]   that looks even better than the other one
[01:35:04.320 --> 01:35:08.400]   that a Sony tape player that has to have like bar toggle
[01:35:08.400 --> 01:35:11.880]   switches and actual pulsing VU meters and backlit stuff.
[01:35:11.880 --> 01:35:16.880]   And also the fact that unlike actual like stereo
[01:35:16.880 --> 01:35:19.960]   vintage Walkman, nobody wants these.
[01:35:19.960 --> 01:35:23.960]   So it's they're typically like $6 plus another $5 for shipping.
[01:35:23.960 --> 01:35:27.840]   So yeah, I have a, I know I have a pile of tape recorders.
[01:35:27.840 --> 01:35:30.600]   - Great, good luck getting a tape.
[01:35:30.600 --> 01:35:32.040]   - No, no, you can get them.
[01:35:32.040 --> 01:35:35.000]   - I also have a box of, I also have a box of cassette tapes.
[01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:37.600]   Cassettes have found like they're sort of,
[01:35:37.600 --> 01:35:40.040]   now the cassettes have found their sort of renaissance
[01:35:40.040 --> 01:35:42.120]   that yeah, exactly that.
[01:35:42.120 --> 01:35:44.200]   I don't understand it as a practical thing
[01:35:44.200 --> 01:35:46.520]   because they still are really inconvenient
[01:35:46.520 --> 01:35:49.440]   and they sound like garbage unless you buy the five,
[01:35:49.440 --> 01:35:52.760]   unless you buy the Nakamichi Dragon for $2,000
[01:35:52.760 --> 01:35:55.560]   then send it out for $1,000 for the calibration
[01:35:55.560 --> 01:35:59.440]   and then buy the $80 ceramic cassette for it.
[01:35:59.440 --> 01:36:00.400]   There people are into that,
[01:36:00.400 --> 01:36:02.800]   but it's like at the end of the day,
[01:36:02.800 --> 01:36:04.680]   I like pushing the buttons, I like lighting it up.
[01:36:04.680 --> 01:36:06.960]   I had like having it on a shelf as a static object
[01:36:06.960 --> 01:36:09.080]   to just sort of enjoy the design of,
[01:36:09.080 --> 01:36:11.320]   but then I'm back to like the,
[01:36:11.320 --> 01:36:14.680]   I'm back to the flak files on my server and I have always
[01:36:14.680 --> 01:36:18.120]   wanted one of those Nogra real-to-real recorders
[01:36:18.120 --> 01:36:20.320]   that they go out in the field and one of these,
[01:36:20.320 --> 01:36:21.880]   you can still get them on eBay.
[01:36:21.880 --> 01:36:23.760]   This one looks like it spent some time in the field
[01:36:23.760 --> 01:36:27.480]   and it's a mere $1,000 boy.
[01:36:27.480 --> 01:36:28.640]   - Chief, three times the price.
[01:36:28.640 --> 01:36:29.520]   - Yeah.
[01:36:29.520 --> 01:36:30.360]   - Oh, there it goes.
[01:36:30.360 --> 01:36:32.200]   You can get real-to-real for like,
[01:36:32.200 --> 01:36:34.040]   that's more adorable than that for like,
[01:36:34.040 --> 01:36:34.880]   what is it?
[01:36:34.880 --> 01:36:37.800]   - That's adorable, but it's not a Nogra, come on.
[01:36:37.800 --> 01:36:40.160]   It's not a Nogra, but it does a Nogra have a handy
[01:36:40.160 --> 01:36:41.000]   carrying handle?
[01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:42.680]   Is the Nogra gonna be like,
[01:36:42.680 --> 01:36:46.280]   you give your best tunes of like 1964 at the beach?
[01:36:46.280 --> 01:36:48.840]   - Oh man, you get that sound too.
[01:36:48.840 --> 01:36:50.000]   - It could also, yeah.
[01:36:50.000 --> 01:36:52.800]   - It is, well it is, again, it is that fancy
[01:36:52.800 --> 01:36:54.800]   audio file like real-to-real.
[01:36:54.800 --> 01:36:57.160]   So.
[01:36:57.160 --> 01:36:58.520]   - That's so funny.
[01:36:58.520 --> 01:36:59.920]   - That's exactly it.
[01:36:59.920 --> 01:37:02.400]   - It's a little, I've gone a little bit crazy.
[01:37:02.400 --> 01:37:03.240]   - You have.
[01:37:03.240 --> 01:37:04.720]   - I will, is this the,
[01:37:04.720 --> 01:37:05.800]   - But is it so adorable?
[01:37:05.800 --> 01:37:07.080]   - It's cool, it is cute.
[01:37:07.080 --> 01:37:09.920]   - It'll spend hours at the MIT flea market or?
[01:37:09.920 --> 01:37:13.520]   - I'm kicking myself because they're,
[01:37:13.520 --> 01:37:16.560]   I've ever since like, rediscovering how cool the design is.
[01:37:16.560 --> 01:37:19.760]   I'm re-imagining, oh, remember that time?
[01:37:19.760 --> 01:37:22.320]   Like, and probably six years ago that someone was getting
[01:37:22.320 --> 01:37:24.720]   rid of like, their entire like, real-to-real setup?
[01:37:24.720 --> 01:37:27.000]   And they had a nakai that was actually plugged in
[01:37:27.000 --> 01:37:29.160]   and running with the big like 10 inch reels
[01:37:29.160 --> 01:37:32.680]   and had all the beautiful like analog glow to it.
[01:37:32.680 --> 01:37:35.600]   And you said, nah, I mean, $70,
[01:37:35.600 --> 01:37:37.680]   that's a lot of money to spend at the flea market
[01:37:37.680 --> 01:37:40.120]   on one thing and plus, what am I gonna do with it?
[01:37:40.120 --> 01:37:41.760]   And, well, I'm going to put it on a shelf,
[01:37:41.760 --> 01:37:44.000]   I'm going to admire it because it's lovely.
[01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:45.880]   - I kind of like that.
[01:37:45.880 --> 01:37:49.720]   I think, you know, I bought an old Rolle camera,
[01:37:49.720 --> 01:37:51.200]   you know, the ones that you, the Rolle Flex.
[01:37:51.200 --> 01:37:52.040]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:37:52.040 --> 01:37:53.840]   - And I bought them like an M3.
[01:37:53.840 --> 01:37:55.600]   They were in very, very good condition.
[01:37:55.600 --> 01:37:57.960]   I was actually able to use them and take pictures,
[01:37:57.960 --> 01:38:00.320]   but I realized there's so much work to take film.
[01:38:00.320 --> 01:38:02.240]   (laughing)
[01:38:02.240 --> 01:38:03.080]   - I know.
[01:38:03.080 --> 01:38:05.160]   - I want to love it and I want to,
[01:38:05.160 --> 01:38:06.640]   and I want to play. - You beautifully made.
[01:38:06.640 --> 01:38:08.520]   I mean, there works of art.
[01:38:08.520 --> 01:38:10.440]   - Yeah, but then it's such a pain in the butt.
[01:38:10.440 --> 01:38:13.640]   So I can only take 35 pictures
[01:38:13.640 --> 01:38:16.200]   and then I don't know what you got until you develop.
[01:38:16.200 --> 01:38:18.960]   - I got, I was doing a house cleaning a few years ago
[01:38:18.960 --> 01:38:21.800]   and found like one of my favorite cameras I've ever owned,
[01:38:21.800 --> 01:38:23.880]   which was like an Olympus stylist,
[01:38:23.880 --> 01:38:25.960]   like Clamshell 35 millimeter.
[01:38:25.960 --> 01:38:27.760]   Beautiful lens took beautiful pictures.
[01:38:27.760 --> 01:38:28.600]   So, wow, you know what?
[01:38:28.600 --> 01:38:30.760]   And, well, I do have still have a couple of rolls of old,
[01:38:30.760 --> 01:38:31.600]   you know what?
[01:38:31.600 --> 01:38:34.640]   Just for old times sake, I'm gonna go and take a walk
[01:38:34.640 --> 01:38:36.480]   and just take some, shoot a roll of film
[01:38:36.480 --> 01:38:38.040]   and then enjoy that again.
[01:38:38.040 --> 01:38:40.920]   And then I got the pictures back and I guess it was broken
[01:38:40.920 --> 01:38:43.440]   because every single picture was like shifted
[01:38:43.440 --> 01:38:45.400]   and out of focus and like, okay, that was fun
[01:38:45.400 --> 01:38:49.280]   spending $30 to find out that, okay, this is a broken camera.
[01:38:49.280 --> 01:38:52.480]   So yeah, I, I, I, I, I, I think,
[01:38:53.580 --> 01:38:57.680]   my version of Renee has, it comes up with this wonderful
[01:38:57.680 --> 01:39:00.680]   phrase that fear is the soul killer.
[01:39:00.680 --> 01:39:05.000]   And I feel that my version of that is nostalgia is also part,
[01:39:05.000 --> 01:39:07.100]   it doesn't help the soul at all either.
[01:39:07.100 --> 01:39:10.460]   And like, if you're just doing the, remember the 80s?
[01:39:10.460 --> 01:39:13.540]   Remember how fun it was to like rewind your cassette
[01:39:13.540 --> 01:39:14.380]   with a pencil?
[01:39:14.380 --> 01:39:16.620]   Like, yeah, it was a really big pain in the butt.
[01:39:16.620 --> 01:39:18.800]   I remember fast, yeah, and I remember not being able
[01:39:18.800 --> 01:39:20.840]   to find the music that I could find.
[01:39:20.840 --> 01:39:22.480]   And I think, I can thank you.
[01:39:22.480 --> 01:39:26.180]   It was a, thank you for offer of a $600 for this wonderful Sony,
[01:39:26.180 --> 01:39:29.980]   like recording Walkman, pro Walkman, but yeah,
[01:39:29.980 --> 01:39:33.260]   that's a lot of music I could buy and no, thank you.
[01:39:33.260 --> 01:39:38.640]   - To show you the power of the brand,
[01:39:38.640 --> 01:39:44.660]   Governor Cuomo has said you can now get married
[01:39:44.660 --> 01:39:45.700]   over FaceTime.
[01:39:45.700 --> 01:39:50.660]   So actually he didn't say, he didn't say FaceTime.
[01:39:50.660 --> 01:39:54.640]   He saved video, but I do notice that everybody says FaceTime.
[01:39:54.640 --> 01:39:57.020]   You can if you want, do it by Zoom.
[01:39:57.020 --> 01:39:59.760]   - But somebody, I assume bomb you.
[01:39:59.760 --> 01:40:01.040]   - You might get Zoom bombed.
[01:40:01.040 --> 01:40:01.960]   - Yeah.
[01:40:01.960 --> 01:40:04.480]   - So to, well, you know, FaceTime maybe.
[01:40:04.480 --> 01:40:06.080]   - Well, you know, you know why that is?
[01:40:06.080 --> 01:40:08.360]   We've now been in quarantine together long enough
[01:40:08.360 --> 01:40:10.960]   that certain people are taking pregnancy tests.
[01:40:10.960 --> 01:40:11.800]   - Oh, good.
[01:40:11.800 --> 01:40:13.240]   - Not liking the answers.
[01:40:13.240 --> 01:40:15.560]   - There's gonna be, that's a really good point.
[01:40:15.560 --> 01:40:16.400]   There is gonna be-- - Of course,
[01:40:16.400 --> 01:40:17.240]   it's a conversation.
[01:40:17.240 --> 01:40:18.680]   - Baby boom in about nine months.
[01:40:18.680 --> 01:40:20.120]   - That's the first thing an analyst told me,
[01:40:20.120 --> 01:40:22.060]   like soon as it started, I was talking to an analyst.
[01:40:22.060 --> 01:40:23.460]   And you're like, well, we're really big
[01:40:23.460 --> 01:40:25.740]   on consumer package goods because of the baby boom
[01:40:25.740 --> 01:40:28.300]   that follows anything, like any big natural,
[01:40:28.300 --> 01:40:29.820]   does that like not natural disaster, anything
[01:40:29.820 --> 01:40:31.940]   and where people are without entertainment
[01:40:31.940 --> 01:40:33.100]   for long periods of time.
[01:40:33.100 --> 01:40:34.260]   - Yeah, it's gonna happen.
[01:40:34.260 --> 01:40:35.180]   - Do you drool?
[01:40:35.180 --> 01:40:39.060]   - Do I, and I hold, when you hear this,
[01:40:39.060 --> 01:40:40.420]   do you drool?
[01:40:40.420 --> 01:40:41.940]   When I hold this up, do you go,
[01:40:41.940 --> 01:40:45.220]   that's the old Apple keyboard.
[01:40:45.220 --> 01:40:46.340]   No, it's not.
[01:40:46.340 --> 01:40:49.260]   This is a brand new Mataius keyboard
[01:40:49.260 --> 01:40:52.260]   with those beautiful Alps switches.
[01:40:52.260 --> 01:40:56.660]   Mataius are the Macintosh keyboard experts.
[01:40:56.660 --> 01:40:59.000]   If you're working from home and you gotta set up
[01:40:59.000 --> 01:41:03.040]   your own home office, stop using that junky keyboard.
[01:41:03.040 --> 01:41:05.960]   Let Mataius fine tune your home office.
[01:41:05.960 --> 01:41:08.880]   They have such a wide range of keyboards to choose from.
[01:41:08.880 --> 01:41:09.980]   Look at this.
[01:41:09.980 --> 01:41:13.740]   Oh, if you like the Apple style aluminum keyboards,
[01:41:13.740 --> 01:41:15.460]   this might be their most popular.
[01:41:15.460 --> 01:41:17.740]   This is the 10, 'cause it's got the 10 key.
[01:41:17.740 --> 01:41:18.900]   It's aluminum.
[01:41:18.900 --> 01:41:21.020]   It's very much like the Apple keyboard.
[01:41:21.020 --> 01:41:24.700]   Apple, actually, Mataius started way back in 1989,
[01:41:24.700 --> 01:41:26.500]   and they specialize in Mac keyboards,
[01:41:26.500 --> 01:41:29.580]   although all of their keyboards will work with PCs,
[01:41:29.580 --> 01:41:31.820]   that work with Windows, that work with Linux.
[01:41:31.820 --> 01:41:34.060]   But if you're using it with Apple,
[01:41:34.060 --> 01:41:36.660]   you'll like it that it has a fan key,
[01:41:36.660 --> 01:41:39.100]   the command key, all of the function keys
[01:41:39.100 --> 01:41:41.220]   have the right logos on it.
[01:41:41.220 --> 01:41:43.500]   I mean, these are really designed to work with Macs,
[01:41:43.500 --> 01:41:46.180]   'cause Edgar Mataius, their keyboard designer,
[01:41:46.180 --> 01:41:49.180]   the guy who started Mataius, loves Macintosh.
[01:41:49.180 --> 01:41:51.620]   So they've purposely focused on making products
[01:41:51.620 --> 01:41:54.980]   that Apple stopped offering, like the tactile keyboard,
[01:41:54.980 --> 01:41:57.160]   so they can give Mac users more choice.
[01:41:57.160 --> 01:42:01.380]   They offer backlit wireless keyboards with big batteries,
[01:42:01.380 --> 01:42:04.020]   so they go a whole year in between charging,
[01:42:04.020 --> 01:42:05.100]   and they look great.
[01:42:05.100 --> 01:42:07.980]   They designed to work and look just like your
[01:42:07.980 --> 01:42:10.220]   Apple official Apple keyboard,
[01:42:10.220 --> 01:42:13.380]   but oh, there's the rose gold version, by the way.
[01:42:13.380 --> 01:42:16.740]   That's, I guess, who immediately snarfed that up.
[01:42:16.740 --> 01:42:17.580]   (laughs)
[01:42:17.580 --> 01:42:19.660]   There's Micah typing on it,
[01:42:19.660 --> 01:42:22.500]   and I think we had one extra which we sent to Christina Warren,
[01:42:22.500 --> 01:42:24.860]   'cause she's a rose gold fanatic.
[01:42:24.860 --> 01:42:27.500]   You'll like if you're worried about your wrists,
[01:42:27.500 --> 01:42:30.300]   you'll love the Ergo keyboard, it's programmable,
[01:42:30.300 --> 01:42:33.260]   it's got an incredibly comfortable gel palm support,
[01:42:33.260 --> 01:42:36.500]   and it splits out so that your wrists maintain
[01:42:36.500 --> 01:42:38.620]   a straight angle, which is really important,
[01:42:38.620 --> 01:42:41.120]   that Ergo is an incredible keyboard.
[01:42:42.020 --> 01:42:44.700]   And since Apple doesn't make it,
[01:42:44.700 --> 01:42:45.900]   by the way, I wanna point out,
[01:42:45.900 --> 01:42:47.900]   one of the great things about Matthias is,
[01:42:47.900 --> 01:42:50.260]   these are really premium keyboards.
[01:42:50.260 --> 01:42:54.220]   At a very fair price, they work perfectly with Apple's,
[01:42:54.220 --> 01:42:55.780]   the function keys work just like they did
[01:42:55.780 --> 01:42:57.940]   in the Apple keyboard, you don't lose any functionality,
[01:42:57.940 --> 01:42:59.260]   you don't have anything to learn.
[01:42:59.260 --> 01:43:01.740]   They work right out of the box, you just plug them right in.
[01:43:01.740 --> 01:43:03.860]   Although, I have to say, one of the things I really like,
[01:43:03.860 --> 01:43:05.580]   it's a wireless Bluetooth keyboard,
[01:43:05.580 --> 01:43:07.180]   and it has four buttons at the top,
[01:43:07.180 --> 01:43:09.020]   and an extended function key row,
[01:43:09.020 --> 01:43:11.180]   that lets you multi-point parrot.
[01:43:11.180 --> 01:43:13.140]   So this is a unique thing,
[01:43:13.140 --> 01:43:14.940]   but if you have multiple computers in your desk,
[01:43:14.940 --> 01:43:17.060]   it doesn't matter if it's Windows and Mac,
[01:43:17.060 --> 01:43:19.580]   you can assign the function key
[01:43:19.580 --> 01:43:22.420]   to immediately switch over to that computer.
[01:43:22.420 --> 01:43:25.100]   So one keyboard can drive up to four computers,
[01:43:25.100 --> 01:43:27.860]   even better, it knows if it's a Mac,
[01:43:27.860 --> 01:43:30.020]   those keys are Mac keys, if you switch to Windows,
[01:43:30.020 --> 01:43:35.020]   it'll shift all the keys in software to be Windows specific.
[01:43:35.020 --> 01:43:37.340]   I don't know if I have that one here,
[01:43:37.340 --> 01:43:39.940]   but it's a really awesome idea.
[01:43:39.940 --> 01:43:43.020]   One of the other things I like about the keyboard I have
[01:43:43.020 --> 01:43:44.700]   at my desk, it's backlit,
[01:43:44.700 --> 01:43:46.740]   but it has a little dial on the back
[01:43:46.740 --> 01:43:49.340]   that I can go through any color of the RGB lights,
[01:43:49.340 --> 01:43:51.700]   which I just really love, I don't have to do it in software.
[01:43:51.700 --> 01:43:53.580]   I can just fiddle with my knob,
[01:43:53.580 --> 01:43:55.460]   and you know how much I love to do that.
[01:43:55.460 --> 01:43:57.540]   I love Matias, the big seller,
[01:43:57.540 --> 01:44:00.140]   the one I just showed you, the wired aluminum keyboard,
[01:44:00.140 --> 01:44:02.180]   it is an absolute worthy successor to Apple's,
[01:44:02.180 --> 01:44:05.140]   everything the original had, and a little bit more.
[01:44:05.140 --> 01:44:07.940]   The built-in hub, I should show you that,
[01:44:07.940 --> 01:44:09.420]   I really like this feature.
[01:44:09.420 --> 01:44:12.820]   So there is a USB, basically a USB hub.
[01:44:12.820 --> 01:44:15.820]   This wired one has the key,
[01:44:15.820 --> 01:44:18.060]   but then you've got a USB port on this side,
[01:44:18.060 --> 01:44:19.860]   and a USB port on the other side.
[01:44:19.860 --> 01:44:21.580]   So if you're lefty as I am,
[01:44:21.580 --> 01:44:23.100]   I plug the mouse in on the left,
[01:44:23.100 --> 01:44:26.740]   and now I have an extra USB port for a USB thumb drive
[01:44:26.740 --> 01:44:28.500]   or anything I wanna plug into that.
[01:44:28.500 --> 01:44:31.860]   I love that capability, it's a little USB hub.
[01:44:31.860 --> 01:44:38.340]   You can get a keyboard for any system you've got
[01:44:38.420 --> 01:44:40.260]   at a very affordable price,
[01:44:40.260 --> 01:44:43.660]   supports up by you Renee and Aurora Canada,
[01:44:43.660 --> 01:44:46.860]   which means, you know, I like Canadian support.
[01:44:46.860 --> 01:44:48.580]   In fact, two out of three of our advertisers
[01:44:48.580 --> 01:44:52.340]   are Canadian today, they're just the nicest people.
[01:44:52.340 --> 01:44:53.660]   So when you call up Aurora,
[01:44:53.660 --> 01:44:55.340]   you're gonna talk to Janet or Carmella
[01:44:55.340 --> 01:44:57.060]   or one of their other support teams.
[01:44:57.060 --> 01:44:58.860]   Sometimes Edgar picks up the phone too.
[01:44:58.860 --> 01:45:01.060]   If you're lucky enough to get Edgar
[01:45:01.060 --> 01:45:04.500]   picking up the phone, set aside some time.
[01:45:04.500 --> 01:45:07.060]   I had the best conversation with him.
[01:45:07.060 --> 01:45:10.740]   I love talking keyboards and keyboard switches
[01:45:10.740 --> 01:45:11.580]   and all of this stuff.
[01:45:11.580 --> 01:45:14.140]   And he is a keyboard fanatic, Matthias.
[01:45:14.140 --> 01:45:17.180]   You wanna get keyboards for people who love keyboards.
[01:45:17.180 --> 01:45:22.180]   M-A-T-I-A-S dot C-A slash Mac break.
[01:45:22.180 --> 01:45:25.140]   Check out the keyboards, find one that fits your style,
[01:45:25.140 --> 01:45:28.780]   your budget, you will never go back to any other keyboard.
[01:45:28.780 --> 01:45:30.580]   You'll never use an Apple keyboard again.
[01:45:30.580 --> 01:45:31.940]   You'll always go with Matthias.
[01:45:31.940 --> 01:45:36.300]   Matthias dot C-A slash Mac break for 10% off your purchase.
[01:45:36.300 --> 01:45:41.020]   M-A-T-I-A-S dot C-A slash Mac break.
[01:45:41.020 --> 01:45:42.380]   This is the one I'm taking home.
[01:45:42.380 --> 01:45:44.740]   I just love that sound.
[01:45:44.740 --> 01:45:48.540]   I can't use it here 'cause you'd hear me typing all the time.
[01:45:48.540 --> 01:45:49.740]   I just love that sound.
[01:45:49.740 --> 01:45:50.580]   Isn't that great?
[01:45:50.580 --> 01:45:52.340]   And man does it feel good with the type one.
[01:45:52.340 --> 01:45:56.100]   Matthias, thank you Edgar and team Carmella
[01:45:56.100 --> 01:45:58.220]   or Carmella and Janet.
[01:45:58.220 --> 01:46:00.300]   Thank you for your support, we appreciate it.
[01:46:00.300 --> 01:46:02.420]   And thank you for supporting Mac break weekly.
[01:46:02.420 --> 01:46:03.900]   For all of our sponsors,
[01:46:03.900 --> 01:46:06.060]   when you use one of our sponsors,
[01:46:06.060 --> 01:46:07.780]   it doesn't just make them happy.
[01:46:07.780 --> 01:46:10.900]   It helps us stay on the air and we really appreciate it.
[01:46:10.900 --> 01:46:13.100]   It's got a little tough out there right now,
[01:46:13.100 --> 01:46:14.980]   as you might imagine.
[01:46:14.980 --> 01:46:17.940]   Sad news, although maybe not so sad,
[01:46:17.940 --> 01:46:22.940]   we have one of those Blackmagic EGPU external GPU devices.
[01:46:22.940 --> 01:46:25.300]   You plug it into your laptop
[01:46:25.300 --> 01:46:27.500]   and suddenly you've got a nice Radeon.
[01:46:27.500 --> 01:46:30.940]   They're gonna discontinue the EGPU Pro,
[01:46:30.940 --> 01:46:33.220]   but the one we bought, the standard will be,
[01:46:33.220 --> 01:46:34.460]   is gonna continue.
[01:46:35.780 --> 01:46:37.420]   And it probably has more to do with the radiance
[01:46:37.420 --> 01:46:39.980]   they're using than anything else, I would guess.
[01:46:39.980 --> 01:46:41.860]   Or maybe the market didn't prove to be as big
[01:46:41.860 --> 01:46:43.220]   as they hoped it would.
[01:46:43.220 --> 01:46:45.580]   The Pro was 1200 bucks
[01:46:45.580 --> 01:46:48.740]   and there are other external GPU cases
[01:46:48.740 --> 01:46:50.180]   you can use with a Mac, right?
[01:46:50.180 --> 01:46:52.020]   You're not--
[01:46:52.020 --> 01:46:53.180]   Yes, they're generic.
[01:46:53.180 --> 01:46:54.140]   Just yeah, they're generic.
[01:46:54.140 --> 01:46:56.460]   Just 'cause you're buying it at the Apple store,
[01:46:56.460 --> 01:46:58.340]   you're getting Blackmagic, you're paying a little more,
[01:46:58.340 --> 01:46:59.180]   but you can get some of it.
[01:46:59.180 --> 01:47:00.940]   Apple just wanted a nice one, they could put on a slide.
[01:47:00.940 --> 01:47:02.100]   It's like where they work with Belkin
[01:47:02.100 --> 01:47:03.900]   or they work with one of the other
[01:47:03.900 --> 01:47:05.500]   and they're like, "Oh, you're a large tech, one of those vendors?"
[01:47:05.500 --> 01:47:08.100]   It is beautiful, it looks like a nuclear power pack
[01:47:08.100 --> 01:47:09.820]   cooling tower.
[01:47:09.820 --> 01:47:11.580]   It looks like Nakamichi Tower.
[01:47:11.580 --> 01:47:12.420]   Yeah.
[01:47:12.420 --> 01:47:14.340]   You get your Bruce Willis-Oshin figures
[01:47:14.340 --> 01:47:15.620]   to jump from the top of it.
[01:47:15.620 --> 01:47:17.700]   (laughs)
[01:47:17.700 --> 01:47:20.100]   (humming)
[01:47:20.100 --> 01:47:22.900]   I think we can take a break and get your picks,
[01:47:22.900 --> 01:47:24.460]   what do you say?
[01:47:24.460 --> 01:47:25.300]   I'm good.
[01:47:25.300 --> 01:47:26.740]   In the mood, anything I missed
[01:47:26.740 --> 01:47:31.580]   that you desperately wanna cover, speak now.
[01:47:31.580 --> 01:47:32.620]   Or forever.
[01:47:32.620 --> 01:47:34.380]   I did see, I didn't put in the show notes,
[01:47:34.380 --> 01:47:38.060]   but there is a story about how Apple is doing a special,
[01:47:38.060 --> 01:47:41.620]   like streaming briefing for accessibility features
[01:47:41.620 --> 01:47:43.100]   ahead of WWDC.
[01:47:43.100 --> 01:47:43.940]   I did see that.
[01:47:43.940 --> 01:47:45.340]   Yeah, they're inviting developers,
[01:47:45.340 --> 01:47:47.780]   but it's not all of them.
[01:47:47.780 --> 01:47:49.820]   So yeah, yeah, it's interesting.
[01:47:49.820 --> 01:47:52.660]   I'm not sure if they're gonna roll out more options.
[01:47:52.660 --> 01:47:56.220]   One of our coworkers got an invite to it,
[01:47:56.220 --> 01:47:59.780]   and so it's not like certain types
[01:47:59.780 --> 01:48:01.420]   of developers or something like that.
[01:48:01.420 --> 01:48:03.420]   So I would love to find out
[01:48:03.420 --> 01:48:05.940]   whether they're gonna just roll this out to everyone
[01:48:05.940 --> 01:48:07.260]   and they're doing it in batches.
[01:48:07.260 --> 01:48:09.020]   Maybe that would be really great
[01:48:09.020 --> 01:48:11.340]   if everybody had the opportunity to attend it.
[01:48:11.340 --> 01:48:12.300]   I bet that's what they'll do.
[01:48:12.300 --> 01:48:14.420]   Why wouldn't you, right?
[01:48:14.420 --> 01:48:15.260]   There's no limitation.
[01:48:15.260 --> 01:48:16.100]   Yeah, that makes the most sense.
[01:48:16.100 --> 01:48:17.860]   Yeah, you could be physical limitation
[01:48:17.860 --> 01:48:19.580]   when you're trying to do it at Moscone Center,
[01:48:19.580 --> 01:48:23.020]   but you know, or wherever the Apple does it,
[01:48:23.020 --> 01:48:25.660]   but there's no limit now to digital.
[01:48:25.660 --> 01:48:28.020]   Renee Richie, starting a new business during COVID.
[01:48:28.020 --> 01:48:31.340]   You're a crazy man, but I hope it's going well
[01:48:31.340 --> 01:48:33.100]   for youtube.com/ReneeRitchie.
[01:48:33.100 --> 01:48:34.860]   What's your pick of the week?
[01:48:34.860 --> 01:48:38.380]   Oh, you're muted.
[01:48:38.380 --> 01:48:39.820]   Unmute yourself.
[01:48:39.820 --> 01:48:43.500]   So it's a little bit off the cuff,
[01:48:43.500 --> 01:48:45.580]   but I hope it makes sense in context.
[01:48:45.580 --> 01:48:48.060]   And that is when you look at the iPhone SE,
[01:48:48.060 --> 01:48:49.660]   even though Apple's going higher end
[01:48:49.660 --> 01:48:50.900]   with their top end iPhones,
[01:48:50.900 --> 01:48:53.060]   like the iPhone 11 Pro Max,
[01:48:53.060 --> 01:48:56.380]   and they've gotten higher end with the iPad Pro,
[01:48:56.380 --> 01:48:58.060]   they've also done this wonderful thing
[01:48:58.060 --> 01:49:01.300]   where they've got really, really good lower end products now.
[01:49:01.300 --> 01:49:03.100]   The iPhone SE is an example.
[01:49:03.100 --> 01:49:05.980]   The 10.2 inch iPad is absolutely an example.
[01:49:05.980 --> 01:49:07.220]   And the Apple Watch 3,
[01:49:07.220 --> 01:49:10.220]   which is still an incredibly good watch,
[01:49:10.220 --> 01:49:13.860]   like digital watch, is 199 bucks.
[01:49:13.860 --> 01:49:15.420]   And I forget who it was on Twitter.
[01:49:15.420 --> 01:49:16.740]   I think it was Matt Gonzales who said,
[01:49:16.740 --> 01:49:20.420]   like you can get an iPhone SE, an Apple Watch Series 3,
[01:49:20.420 --> 01:49:22.660]   and maybe the AirPods 2 for less than you can get
[01:49:22.660 --> 01:49:23.900]   most mid-range phones this year,
[01:49:23.900 --> 01:49:25.660]   or at least the same price as you can get
[01:49:25.660 --> 01:49:28.980]   most mid-range phones around $750, $750 phones.
[01:49:28.980 --> 01:49:31.940]   And that is an incredibly compelling package.
[01:49:31.940 --> 01:49:33.700]   And then Georgia Dow said something recently,
[01:49:33.700 --> 01:49:35.780]   like in Thomas Frank, a bunch of productivity,
[01:49:35.780 --> 01:49:37.620]   I was asking them,
[01:49:37.620 --> 01:49:39.700]   what do you recommend for people who are stuck at home,
[01:49:39.700 --> 01:49:41.580]   what are better ways for them to use their iPhones
[01:49:41.580 --> 01:49:42.740]   to help with productivity?
[01:49:42.740 --> 01:49:45.260]   And they said, you know, set it up and then throw it away.
[01:49:45.260 --> 01:49:47.260]   Like throw it on the couch, leave it in another room,
[01:49:47.260 --> 01:49:49.060]   because it's gonna be buzzing and beeping
[01:49:49.060 --> 01:49:50.220]   and getting in your way.
[01:49:50.220 --> 01:49:51.620]   And then you have your Apple Watch.
[01:49:51.620 --> 01:49:53.660]   And if you set up your notifications right,
[01:49:53.660 --> 01:49:54.660]   those will come through.
[01:49:54.660 --> 01:49:56.420]   The important stuff will come through.
[01:49:56.420 --> 01:49:58.580]   If you get in trouble, if there's an emergency,
[01:49:58.580 --> 01:50:01.420]   if you need help, all of that is still available,
[01:50:01.420 --> 01:50:02.940]   it's connected to you.
[01:50:02.940 --> 01:50:04.620]   You've got all the health benefits,
[01:50:04.620 --> 01:50:07.580]   but you're not sort of stuck in this digital quagmire.
[01:50:07.580 --> 01:50:09.420]   And if you check a notification on your watch,
[01:50:09.420 --> 01:50:11.460]   you can't dive into Twitter or YouTube
[01:50:11.460 --> 01:50:12.620]   for the next hour and a half
[01:50:12.620 --> 01:50:15.100]   and wonder where the day has been.
[01:50:15.100 --> 01:50:16.060]   You just have to check it,
[01:50:16.060 --> 01:50:18.420]   and then you go back to working on your,
[01:50:18.420 --> 01:50:21.660]   whatever, you know, actual work or job you're supposed
[01:50:21.660 --> 01:50:22.660]   to be doing.
[01:50:22.660 --> 01:50:24.260]   And it just, it sort of clicked for me
[01:50:24.260 --> 01:50:25.700]   because I've been doing that.
[01:50:25.700 --> 01:50:27.340]   I always have all my notifications off
[01:50:27.340 --> 01:50:30.900]   and I use my Apple Watch for everything while I'm working.
[01:50:30.900 --> 01:50:34.020]   And if people haven't gotten into the Apple Watch yet,
[01:50:34.020 --> 01:50:35.700]   just the $199 price tag,
[01:50:35.700 --> 01:50:38.300]   and you can find them like at thrift or in other places,
[01:50:38.300 --> 01:50:40.420]   you can even find Apple Watch 4s or 5s.
[01:50:40.420 --> 01:50:42.980]   On massive sales several times a year,
[01:50:42.980 --> 01:50:46.620]   it's really worth looking at as just an everyday,
[01:50:46.620 --> 01:50:47.900]   stuck at home, stay at home,
[01:50:47.900 --> 01:50:50.340]   work from home productivity tool.
[01:50:50.340 --> 01:50:52.620]   - I think that's a really good point.
[01:50:52.620 --> 01:50:55.260]   Is there, is it a better deal to get maybe the series
[01:50:55.260 --> 01:50:56.540]   of five refurb, probably not.
[01:50:56.540 --> 01:50:58.620]   You can't get every 200 bucks refurb.
[01:50:58.620 --> 01:51:01.580]   - No, I mean, it depends on what your price range is.
[01:51:01.580 --> 01:51:03.180]   I know money is really tight for people now.
[01:51:03.180 --> 01:51:04.700]   If like money's not your problem,
[01:51:04.700 --> 01:51:07.340]   the series five has a bunch of extra benefits,
[01:51:07.340 --> 01:51:09.340]   you know, especially for like fall detection
[01:51:09.340 --> 01:51:11.620]   and the heart rate monitor and the ECG,
[01:51:11.620 --> 01:51:13.340]   although like sort of those things.
[01:51:13.340 --> 01:51:14.460]   So that's really important to you
[01:51:14.460 --> 01:51:16.620]   or you're worried that your parents are stuck at home
[01:51:16.620 --> 01:51:18.620]   and they're not being checked on regularly.
[01:51:18.620 --> 01:51:20.220]   That's a great thing to look at for them.
[01:51:20.220 --> 01:51:23.500]   But if you just want something to do notifications,
[01:51:23.500 --> 01:51:25.460]   really, really well and all the fitness benefits
[01:51:25.460 --> 01:51:29.140]   for when you get to get your one walk or one run a day in,
[01:51:29.140 --> 01:51:30.980]   I think it's a really compelling package at 100 and a dollar.
[01:51:30.980 --> 01:51:32.500]   - What does the five have that?
[01:51:32.500 --> 01:51:35.140]   The only thing is the stay on thing, right?
[01:51:35.140 --> 01:51:36.140]   - The always on, yeah.
[01:51:36.140 --> 01:51:36.980]   - Always on.
[01:51:36.980 --> 01:51:37.820]   - And that's huge for me.
[01:51:37.820 --> 01:51:39.220]   Like I have a hard time going back.
[01:51:39.220 --> 01:51:41.740]   I think my watch is broken when I look back
[01:51:41.740 --> 01:51:44.860]   at the iPhone 4, they're up a watch for three months ago.
[01:51:44.860 --> 01:51:47.860]   But from, like for most people, you don't need that.
[01:51:47.860 --> 01:51:49.420]   It's just gonna buzz on your wrist
[01:51:49.420 --> 01:51:50.860]   and you'll know that something's up.
[01:51:50.860 --> 01:51:52.740]   - Well, actually the stay on makes me think
[01:51:52.740 --> 01:51:55.220]   my watch is broken 'cause sometimes it doesn't wake up
[01:51:55.220 --> 01:51:57.700]   and I try to do stuff and it doesn't respond.
[01:51:57.700 --> 01:52:00.220]   - So there's something I wish that they would fix
[01:52:00.220 --> 01:52:02.140]   and that is the notification comes up
[01:52:02.140 --> 01:52:03.980]   and the first touch wakes the screen
[01:52:03.980 --> 01:52:05.540]   and what you think it's gonna do is bring up
[01:52:05.540 --> 01:52:08.300]   the notifications and what they should do is pass that through.
[01:52:08.300 --> 01:52:10.260]   If the notification is on the screen,
[01:52:10.260 --> 01:52:13.020]   that touch should wake up and then the wake up should send,
[01:52:13.020 --> 01:52:14.900]   oh, he woke up to check notification.
[01:52:14.900 --> 01:52:16.940]   But you know, I filed that radar, Leo.
[01:52:16.940 --> 01:52:17.780]   I just, I have-
[01:52:17.780 --> 01:52:18.620]   - Thank you.
[01:52:18.620 --> 01:52:21.260]   On behalf of us all, thank you.
[01:52:21.260 --> 01:52:23.180]   Andy and I co-pick of the work.
[01:52:23.180 --> 01:52:27.380]   - I'm using, in addition to going a little bit nuts
[01:52:27.380 --> 01:52:29.860]   buying tape recorders, I'm also trying to,
[01:52:29.860 --> 01:52:32.860]   I'm using every three years I get the bug in my ear
[01:52:32.860 --> 01:52:35.340]   that, you know, the reason why you don't do videos
[01:52:35.340 --> 01:52:37.500]   is because you're terrible at doing videos.
[01:52:37.500 --> 01:52:39.620]   I don't know how to write for a video
[01:52:39.620 --> 01:52:41.860]   and I don't know how to edit video.
[01:52:41.860 --> 01:52:43.060]   So every two or three years, you know,
[01:52:43.060 --> 01:52:44.500]   you should now just buckle down
[01:52:44.500 --> 01:52:47.220]   and maybe the new tools that you see around
[01:52:47.220 --> 01:52:50.940]   will be handy, inspired in no small part
[01:52:50.940 --> 01:52:53.900]   by our friend Renee and the cool stuff
[01:52:53.900 --> 01:52:55.620]   that he's doing with video.
[01:52:55.620 --> 01:53:00.060]   So I've actually been playing with a Blackmagic Design
[01:53:00.060 --> 01:53:03.860]   who's been made so famous through so many of Alex's picks
[01:53:03.860 --> 01:53:06.220]   that make those really great great cameras.
[01:53:06.220 --> 01:53:09.980]   They also have an editing suite called DaVinci Resolve 16.
[01:53:09.980 --> 01:53:14.460]   And it's, I've chosen it as the one that I'm going to sort,
[01:53:14.460 --> 01:53:17.260]   learn and relearn stuff on for a couple of reasons
[01:53:17.260 --> 01:53:20.340]   'cause they have a junior edition
[01:53:20.340 --> 01:53:23.060]   that only is missing the Super Pro stuff
[01:53:23.060 --> 01:53:25.340]   and it's free for downloading.
[01:53:25.340 --> 01:53:29.940]   And the, if you actually do buy the DaVinci Resolve 16 Pro,
[01:53:29.940 --> 01:53:32.660]   it is a flat 300 bucks, no subscriptions,
[01:53:32.660 --> 01:53:34.820]   no need to log in, no need to do anything.
[01:53:34.820 --> 01:53:39.660]   And what two things about it have really impressed me
[01:53:39.660 --> 01:53:44.300]   that because I'm definitely a noob,
[01:53:44.300 --> 01:53:48.660]   I appreciate not being confused by stuff
[01:53:48.660 --> 01:53:50.420]   that I don't know how to use yet.
[01:53:50.420 --> 01:53:52.580]   So it actually has a mode called Cut,
[01:53:52.580 --> 01:53:55.980]   which is almost like having, imagine if Final Cut
[01:53:55.980 --> 01:53:57.980]   also had iMovie built into it.
[01:53:57.980 --> 01:54:01.220]   So if you said that, hey, I'm such a hot professional
[01:54:01.220 --> 01:54:04.500]   that I'm live editing a commercial as a comp for somebody,
[01:54:04.500 --> 01:54:06.140]   I needed this done in five minutes.
[01:54:06.140 --> 01:54:07.700]   Or if you're someone like me who says,
[01:54:07.700 --> 01:54:10.380]   I need you to take away the stuff that's going to stop me
[01:54:10.380 --> 01:54:11.740]   from getting things finished.
[01:54:11.740 --> 01:54:13.220]   It really does simplify the interface,
[01:54:13.220 --> 01:54:14.940]   it really does simplify the workflow.
[01:54:14.940 --> 01:54:19.740]   The other thing I liked about it is that I am nowhere
[01:54:19.740 --> 01:54:22.780]   near sophisticated enough to understand color grading
[01:54:22.780 --> 01:54:25.380]   and to understand things like Adobe Premiere Effects,
[01:54:25.380 --> 01:54:27.100]   motion effects, stuff like that.
[01:54:27.100 --> 01:54:29.420]   But I do understand those buzzwords
[01:54:29.420 --> 01:54:30.980]   and I understand how important they are
[01:54:30.980 --> 01:54:33.100]   for full featured editing.
[01:54:33.100 --> 01:54:35.500]   And I love the fact that even the free edition
[01:54:35.500 --> 01:54:36.900]   has those features built in.
[01:54:36.900 --> 01:54:41.900]   So once I get into a rhythm of where simply shooting something
[01:54:42.820 --> 01:54:47.820]   and editing it is no longer a desperate hellscape of confusion,
[01:54:47.820 --> 01:54:50.940]   I feel like I can grow into this.
[01:54:50.940 --> 01:54:55.940]   And lastly, I have not lost my instinct
[01:54:55.940 --> 01:55:01.220]   for favoring a multi-platform solution
[01:55:01.220 --> 01:55:03.300]   over an Apple only solution.
[01:55:03.300 --> 01:55:05.060]   Not the Final Cut isn't wonderful,
[01:55:05.060 --> 01:55:08.380]   but who knows what's happening the next two or three years?
[01:55:08.380 --> 01:55:11.020]   I don't anticipate leaving Mac at all,
[01:55:11.020 --> 01:55:13.420]   but in two or three years,
[01:55:13.420 --> 01:55:16.620]   maybe my needs will be such that I want to have
[01:55:16.620 --> 01:55:20.180]   the 16 core i9 processor in a box
[01:55:20.180 --> 01:55:23.860]   for all the really, really heavy, intensive stuff that I do.
[01:55:23.860 --> 01:55:28.140]   And for that CPU, I will want to get to maximize my money
[01:55:28.140 --> 01:55:31.460]   by getting a Windows box instead of getting a Mac Pro.
[01:55:31.460 --> 01:55:33.180]   And then I'll be very, very pleased
[01:55:33.180 --> 01:55:35.100]   that I chose a solution that will run on Windows.
[01:55:35.100 --> 01:55:37.500]   It'll also run on Linux, it'll run on whatever you have.
[01:55:37.500 --> 01:55:39.700]   So I do instinctively like the idea
[01:55:39.700 --> 01:55:41.300]   of a multi-platform solution.
[01:55:41.300 --> 01:55:43.980]   But for most people, it's just gonna be a good way
[01:55:43.980 --> 01:55:47.340]   to get something that's on the level of Final Cut Pro,
[01:55:47.340 --> 01:55:52.340]   but for free because it's heartbreaking to want to get
[01:55:52.340 --> 01:55:56.180]   into a new thing and then be stymied by,
[01:55:56.180 --> 01:56:01.180]   oh, I don't know if I can make use of $150, $200, $300 app
[01:56:01.180 --> 01:56:03.900]   or a subscription app like Adobe Premiere.
[01:56:03.900 --> 01:56:06.060]   This allows you to really just mess around with things
[01:56:06.060 --> 01:56:09.340]   and try the shoes on and walk around a bit
[01:56:09.340 --> 01:56:10.980]   and see if they fit.
[01:56:10.980 --> 01:56:12.620]   - Very nice. - So good too.
[01:56:12.620 --> 01:56:14.740]   - A lot of the pros use it, the color grading is amazing.
[01:56:14.740 --> 01:56:16.060]   It's an excellent experience. - Oh, really?
[01:56:16.060 --> 01:56:17.380]   Interesting, yeah.
[01:56:17.380 --> 01:56:19.260]   And the fact that they're giving it away
[01:56:19.260 --> 01:56:20.380]   is pretty amazing, right?
[01:56:20.380 --> 01:56:22.700]   - Yeah, and like Gany said, the dongle version is,
[01:56:22.700 --> 01:56:23.780]   actually the got rid of the dongle.
[01:56:23.780 --> 01:56:25.660]   Up until very recently, you had to actually have a dongle
[01:56:25.660 --> 01:56:26.780]   to use the Pro version.
[01:56:26.780 --> 01:56:30.020]   It really is very like Alex Lindsey features
[01:56:30.020 --> 01:56:30.860]   that you're missing.
[01:56:30.860 --> 01:56:32.180]   I don't think we'll even notice it.
[01:56:32.180 --> 01:56:33.620]   - You don't have the dongle version.
[01:56:33.620 --> 01:56:35.980]   - Yeah, and we use a lot of Blackmagic stuff.
[01:56:35.980 --> 01:56:38.140]   I've been, I'm setting up a home studio,
[01:56:38.140 --> 01:56:40.780]   which I'm gonna do and ask the tech guy about.
[01:56:40.780 --> 01:56:43.420]   With the ATEM Mini switcher, 300 bucks.
[01:56:43.420 --> 01:56:45.940]   You know, the Blackmagic converters,
[01:56:45.940 --> 01:56:49.980]   which will turn my fancy DSLRs into webcams.
[01:56:49.980 --> 01:56:51.500]   And it's just really, it is.
[01:56:51.500 --> 01:56:52.900]   It's pretty exciting what you can do.
[01:56:52.900 --> 01:56:54.740]   I think Blackmagic deserves a lot of credit
[01:56:54.740 --> 01:56:57.980]   for making Pro video affordable.
[01:56:57.980 --> 01:56:59.460]   So, and DaVinci. - The magic part
[01:56:59.460 --> 01:57:00.500]   of their name is accurate.
[01:57:00.500 --> 01:57:04.980]   - Yes, it's technology at its best when you get excited
[01:57:04.980 --> 01:57:07.220]   about what you can, not by the technology,
[01:57:07.220 --> 01:57:09.380]   but by imagining what you can do with the technology.
[01:57:09.380 --> 01:57:11.180]   Like that Blackmagic switcher.
[01:57:11.180 --> 01:57:13.820]   I am sort of lusting after,
[01:57:13.820 --> 01:57:16.940]   and I might give into insanity in a couple months.
[01:57:16.940 --> 01:57:18.260]   - I mean, can't 9,000 anyway.
[01:57:18.260 --> 01:57:22.140]   - Exactly, just the idea of being able to simply do videos.
[01:57:22.140 --> 01:57:25.460]   What annoys me about doing video is that
[01:57:25.460 --> 01:57:27.940]   I will think about, gee, I would love to like switch between
[01:57:27.940 --> 01:57:30.340]   like an overhead shot or a wide shot in the middle,
[01:57:30.340 --> 01:57:32.380]   but now I'm gonna have, that means I'm probably gonna have
[01:57:32.380 --> 01:57:34.700]   to like shoot this whole thing twice and edit it.
[01:57:34.700 --> 01:57:36.580]   If I could just do quick and dirty,
[01:57:36.580 --> 01:57:39.300]   just press a button to switch there, switch there, switch there,
[01:57:39.300 --> 01:57:42.020]   just essentially edit it live, that would remove,
[01:57:42.020 --> 01:57:45.020]   that gives me so many ideas for things that I could do.
[01:57:45.020 --> 01:57:47.180]   And no matter what the technology is,
[01:57:47.180 --> 01:57:49.140]   that is the sign of a good piece of technology.
[01:57:49.140 --> 01:57:51.660]   When you're thinking, gee, if I had this,
[01:57:51.660 --> 01:57:54.180]   that would remove this pressure point or this pain point
[01:57:54.180 --> 01:57:55.700]   in this thing I wanna create,
[01:57:55.700 --> 01:57:58.180]   and it will help me to want to create more.
[01:57:58.180 --> 01:58:00.100]   - There was that great thing from,
[01:58:00.100 --> 01:58:02.100]   I forget his last name, Ash, the guy who does all the Hollywood
[01:58:02.100 --> 01:58:03.980]   recording for really famous celebrities,
[01:58:03.980 --> 01:58:05.860]   and he was talking about the new MacBook Pro.
[01:58:05.860 --> 01:58:07.820]   And he said like for years, technology has been great,
[01:58:07.820 --> 01:58:10.300]   but it's like this layer of goo that he has to go through
[01:58:10.300 --> 01:58:12.420]   every time just to get his creative work done.
[01:58:12.420 --> 01:58:14.540]   And over the years, that layer is getting thinner
[01:58:14.540 --> 01:58:17.060]   and thinner and thinner, and that's what it feels like.
[01:58:17.060 --> 01:58:19.100]   - That's what good technology should do.
[01:58:19.100 --> 01:58:20.260]   Get out of the way. - Get out of the way.
[01:58:20.260 --> 01:58:22.260]   - Yeah, so that you can create.
[01:58:22.260 --> 01:58:25.340]   Laurie Gill has something that gets out of the way.
[01:58:25.340 --> 01:58:30.340]   - Yeah, so Andy was describing sort of his ideal
[01:58:30.340 --> 01:58:35.180]   keyboard cover/case for an iPad Pro
[01:58:35.180 --> 01:58:36.940]   that did all these things.
[01:58:36.940 --> 01:58:41.460]   And he's basically describing the Bridge Pro Plus.
[01:58:41.460 --> 01:58:43.660]   So I just thought I would bring that up.
[01:58:43.660 --> 01:58:47.100]   I've talked about this before a number of times on the show.
[01:58:47.100 --> 01:58:51.820]   And for everybody who's not sure about the Magic Keyboard,
[01:58:51.820 --> 01:58:55.940]   maybe it's too expensive, there's also the Bridge Pro Plus.
[01:58:55.940 --> 01:58:57.140]   And it's pretty fantastic.
[01:58:57.140 --> 01:58:57.980]   It works really well.
[01:58:57.980 --> 01:59:02.460]   It has backlit keys, it has a media function around the top
[01:59:02.460 --> 01:59:05.700]   so that you can lock the iPad, change the screen brightness.
[01:59:05.700 --> 01:59:07.620]   You can play all your media.
[01:59:07.620 --> 01:59:10.140]   It has, what are some of the other,
[01:59:10.140 --> 01:59:13.700]   oh, the adjustable viewing angle is actually pretty significant
[01:59:13.700 --> 01:59:14.540]   in this one.
[01:59:14.540 --> 01:59:18.700]   It goes from all the way closed to 180 degrees back.
[01:59:18.700 --> 01:59:21.140]   And there's no stopping point.
[01:59:21.140 --> 01:59:23.380]   You're not stuck at any of those degrees.
[01:59:23.380 --> 01:59:26.980]   It's just completely open and shut the whole way.
[01:59:26.980 --> 01:59:30.340]   What other things did you mention?
[01:59:30.340 --> 01:59:34.020]   There's a working trackpad that's really large.
[01:59:34.020 --> 01:59:35.540]   It has a lot of space on it.
[01:59:35.540 --> 01:59:38.580]   I have not used the Magic trackpad,
[01:59:38.580 --> 01:59:41.180]   but believe me, next week when we talk,
[01:59:41.180 --> 01:59:45.460]   I will almost definitely be describing the differences
[01:59:45.460 --> 01:59:48.500]   between the two because I have a feeling,
[01:59:48.500 --> 01:59:51.540]   I'm gonna have a lot of comparison related sentiments
[01:59:51.540 --> 01:59:52.380]   to talk about.
[01:59:52.380 --> 01:59:56.100]   So just put that out there for people who maybe didn't want
[01:59:56.100 --> 01:59:58.060]   or maybe it's too expensive, the Magic Keyboard.
[01:59:58.060 --> 02:00:00.580]   There's also the Bridge Pro Plus.
[02:00:00.580 --> 02:00:02.460]   - And you have one?
[02:00:02.460 --> 02:00:03.300]   - I do.
[02:00:03.300 --> 02:00:06.340]   - You do, yeah, right now they're shipping late April.
[02:00:06.340 --> 02:00:08.580]   So they'll be shipping pretty soon.
[02:00:08.580 --> 02:00:11.620]   And you'll have a Magic Keyboard to compare it to.
[02:00:11.620 --> 02:00:12.460]   - Exactly.
[02:00:12.460 --> 02:00:13.300]   - Yeah.
[02:00:13.300 --> 02:00:14.780]   - All right.
[02:00:14.780 --> 02:00:18.380]   For a lot of people who are zooming and skyping
[02:00:18.380 --> 02:00:22.300]   and FaceTiming, maybe they're even getting married over FaceTime,
[02:00:22.300 --> 02:00:25.380]   they would like a better camera.
[02:00:25.380 --> 02:00:28.500]   And you already have a pretty good camera
[02:00:28.500 --> 02:00:30.020]   if you have an iPhone or an iPad.
[02:00:30.020 --> 02:00:32.340]   You already have a damn good camera.
[02:00:32.340 --> 02:00:33.860]   People are asking me all the time.
[02:00:33.860 --> 02:00:35.380]   And if you go by the way, you know,
[02:00:35.380 --> 02:00:38.180]   and I'll say, well, get a Logitech C920 or something
[02:00:38.180 --> 02:00:41.180]   and say, well, A, you can't get them.
[02:00:41.180 --> 02:00:44.740]   B, they're scalpers selling them for three times the price.
[02:00:44.740 --> 02:00:47.500]   C, they don't get delivered till June.
[02:00:47.500 --> 02:00:49.740]   You already have an iPhone, you have a great camera,
[02:00:49.740 --> 02:00:52.300]   and this is software that will turn your iPhone
[02:00:52.300 --> 02:00:56.100]   and your iPad into a wired or wireless webcam.
[02:00:56.100 --> 02:00:57.260]   It's called EpicCama.
[02:00:57.260 --> 02:01:00.180]   It was my pick of the week this week on iOS today,
[02:01:00.180 --> 02:01:02.580]   but I thought it bared repeating because,
[02:01:02.580 --> 02:01:04.980]   well, A, I know you all don't watch iOS today.
[02:01:04.980 --> 02:01:06.340]   I don't know how to stand why you don't,
[02:01:06.340 --> 02:01:07.300]   but you don't.
[02:01:07.300 --> 02:01:10.580]   But B, because this is something a lot of people need.
[02:01:10.580 --> 02:01:12.180]   In fact, it works with Android phones.
[02:01:12.180 --> 02:01:14.860]   It works with pretty much any phone, Windows or Mac.
[02:01:14.860 --> 02:01:18.860]   You do have to have, obviously you're running Skype or Zoom
[02:01:18.860 --> 02:01:21.820]   or something on your Mac.
[02:01:21.820 --> 02:01:24.100]   So you do have to have a Mac driver,
[02:01:24.100 --> 02:01:26.860]   but that's offered for free, download it, install it.
[02:01:26.860 --> 02:01:28.820]   You don't even need to reboot.
[02:01:28.820 --> 02:01:32.380]   Then you run the EpicCAM app on your iPhone or iPad.
[02:01:32.380 --> 02:01:34.980]   There's a free version which is somewhat limited
[02:01:34.980 --> 02:01:37.380]   in its capability and has advertising built in.
[02:01:37.380 --> 02:01:39.660]   There's an $8 version that's still a lot cheaper
[02:01:39.660 --> 02:01:42.380]   than the C920 and it works quite well.
[02:01:42.380 --> 02:01:45.060]   You can use the front facing or back cameras.
[02:01:45.060 --> 02:01:47.860]   Since it's your iPhone, if you're using your iPhone
[02:01:47.860 --> 02:01:51.060]   and you're doing the conference on your computer,
[02:01:51.060 --> 02:01:52.980]   just put your iPhone on a tripod
[02:01:52.980 --> 02:01:54.100]   with the back camera at you.
[02:01:54.100 --> 02:01:55.780]   That is now your webcam.
[02:01:55.780 --> 02:01:56.740]   It works great.
[02:01:56.740 --> 02:01:58.620]   It pairs almost instantly.
[02:01:58.620 --> 02:02:00.100]   If you have a USB connection,
[02:02:00.100 --> 02:02:01.220]   that might be a little bit better,
[02:02:01.220 --> 02:02:03.340]   although we were using the Wi-Fi connection
[02:02:03.340 --> 02:02:05.780]   without any difficulty at all.
[02:02:05.780 --> 02:02:10.340]   Resolution is 720p unless you're using a technology
[02:02:10.340 --> 02:02:12.500]   called NDI over a wired connection.
[02:02:12.500 --> 02:02:14.100]   That can go to 1080p.
[02:02:14.100 --> 02:02:16.460]   So it's not using all the resolution available in the camera,
[02:02:16.460 --> 02:02:19.020]   but it's pretty good.
[02:02:19.020 --> 02:02:21.740]   And try the free win and see if it works for you.
[02:02:21.740 --> 02:02:24.300]   And if you like it, it might be worth paying the 8 bucks
[02:02:24.300 --> 02:02:25.940]   for the full version.
[02:02:25.940 --> 02:02:28.860]   You can find out more at the manufacturer's website,
[02:02:28.860 --> 02:02:31.700]   kennone, K-I-N-O-N-I.com,
[02:02:31.700 --> 02:02:36.020]   or search for Epic Cam, E-P-O-C-C-A-M
[02:02:36.020 --> 02:02:38.980]   on the Apple iOS store.
[02:02:38.980 --> 02:02:40.260]   I'm gonna start using it.
[02:02:40.260 --> 02:02:41.100]   It's great.
[02:02:41.100 --> 02:02:43.780]   It's much better than the camera I have on my Mac,
[02:02:43.780 --> 02:02:45.580]   which is not saying a whole lot.
[02:02:45.580 --> 02:02:47.060]   (laughing)
[02:02:47.060 --> 02:02:48.260]   Thank you, Andy.
[02:02:48.260 --> 02:02:50.580]   WGBH coming up.
[02:02:50.580 --> 02:02:53.700]   Yep, on Thursday this week, looks like 1230,
[02:02:53.700 --> 02:02:56.460]   but as usual, check out my Twitter at anaco
[02:02:56.460 --> 02:02:58.220]   to get the actual time and date.
[02:02:58.220 --> 02:03:01.700]   IH-N-A-T-K-O-N-I-N-O-C-A-N-O-C-A-M.com.
[02:03:01.700 --> 02:03:02.780]   Thank you, Andrew.
[02:03:02.780 --> 02:03:04.980]   Lori Gill, are you doing,
[02:03:04.980 --> 02:03:08.220]   or are you gonna do any Zoom concerts with sick burn?
[02:03:08.220 --> 02:03:10.140]   - I don't know if we'll be using Zoom.
[02:03:10.140 --> 02:03:11.780]   - Not Zoom, you know.
[02:03:11.780 --> 02:03:14.420]   Zoom, I'm using that in the generic term
[02:03:14.420 --> 02:03:15.660]   for video conference.
[02:03:15.660 --> 02:03:17.700]   So, yeah, so not me specifically.
[02:03:17.700 --> 02:03:20.340]   Sick burn has not attempted it yet,
[02:03:20.340 --> 02:03:24.180]   but in Sacramento, there's been a lot of my friends
[02:03:24.180 --> 02:03:27.140]   who have, every Friday, I have a friend every Friday night
[02:03:27.140 --> 02:03:32.140]   on Instagram, does a little solo show at eight o'clock
[02:03:32.140 --> 02:03:33.900]   and it's for half an hour.
[02:03:33.900 --> 02:03:38.140]   There's, you know, other, I've been invited to
[02:03:38.140 --> 02:03:41.820]   send a 10 second clip of myself doing something
[02:03:41.820 --> 02:03:45.460]   to a musician friend of mine who's gonna do put together
[02:03:45.460 --> 02:03:48.660]   some kind of collaborative something, I don't know.
[02:03:48.660 --> 02:03:50.540]   So, it's happening all over the place
[02:03:50.540 --> 02:03:53.220]   and it's really great to see that.
[02:03:53.220 --> 02:03:56.540]   - Good, very nice.
[02:03:56.540 --> 02:04:00.900]   And of course, she's a senior editor at iMore.com,
[02:04:00.900 --> 02:04:03.740]   which is really your real job, your day job.
[02:04:03.740 --> 02:04:05.940]   - Your day job. - Your day job.
[02:04:05.940 --> 02:04:10.940]   Thank you also to the brandly, newly fledged YouTube star,
[02:04:10.940 --> 02:04:15.100]   Renee Ritchie, YouTube.com/ReneeRitchie.
[02:04:15.860 --> 02:04:18.020]   What do you got coming up?
[02:04:18.020 --> 02:04:20.100]   - So I did something dumbly, I was gonna wait
[02:04:20.100 --> 02:04:21.940]   because I've always enjoyed having a podcast
[02:04:21.940 --> 02:04:23.740]   and I had to relaunch the podcast the same
[02:04:23.740 --> 02:04:25.580]   as the YouTube channel and I was gonna wait,
[02:04:25.580 --> 02:04:27.580]   but I figured so many people were home
[02:04:27.580 --> 02:04:29.580]   not only waiting for content, but maybe willing
[02:04:29.580 --> 02:04:31.300]   to come on and talk to me.
[02:04:31.300 --> 02:04:33.140]   That I went ahead and launched it early
[02:04:33.140 --> 02:04:35.140]   and I pre-did a bunch of shows.
[02:04:35.140 --> 02:04:38.380]   So the audio, you can get the audio just at the usual
[02:04:38.380 --> 02:04:40.900]   Renee Ritchie podcast link, but I'm doing the video
[02:04:40.900 --> 02:04:43.100]   for Nebula and Patreon and it's the same length.
[02:04:43.100 --> 02:04:46.060]   I'm doing this really extensive edit on it.
[02:04:46.060 --> 02:04:49.540]   So it's a lot of work, but I had Brian Tong on the first one.
[02:04:49.540 --> 02:04:51.220]   I just deans on the second one.
[02:04:51.220 --> 02:04:52.860]   John Gruber is gonna be on the third one.
[02:04:52.860 --> 02:04:54.980]   Walt Mossberg is on the fourth one.
[02:04:54.980 --> 02:04:58.620]   And it's just, it's conversations about technology,
[02:04:58.620 --> 02:05:00.660]   transitions, like what I'm going through,
[02:05:00.660 --> 02:05:02.340]   and then we pick something fun at the end.
[02:05:02.340 --> 02:05:05.260]   So like with Brian, it was comic books, with Gruber,
[02:05:05.260 --> 02:05:07.860]   it was the state of the James Bond franchise,
[02:05:07.860 --> 02:05:10.060]   with Justine, she started Brazilian Jiu Jitsu.
[02:05:10.060 --> 02:05:11.340]   So we had a ton of stuff to talk about.
[02:05:11.340 --> 02:05:12.420]   - Oh, that's your support.
[02:05:12.420 --> 02:05:13.620]   That's really fun. - That's really fun.
[02:05:13.620 --> 02:05:14.900]   That's your martial art.
[02:05:14.900 --> 02:05:15.940]   - Oh. - Yeah.
[02:05:15.940 --> 02:05:16.940]   Did she do that 'cause of you
[02:05:16.940 --> 02:05:18.140]   or was he just a coincidence?
[02:05:18.140 --> 02:05:19.300]   - No, we didn't know that the other,
[02:05:19.300 --> 02:05:21.060]   she was doing it in secret for two years.
[02:05:21.060 --> 02:05:23.660]   I'll let her tell the whole story,
[02:05:23.660 --> 02:05:25.660]   but she was doing it in secret for two years
[02:05:25.660 --> 02:05:28.660]   and she's a blue belt now and she's really smart about it.
[02:05:28.660 --> 02:05:30.580]   - Wow, that's really cool.
[02:05:30.580 --> 02:05:32.540]   Let's need, I'll have to listen to that.
[02:05:32.540 --> 02:05:34.540]   Thank you Renee, thank you all for being here.
[02:05:34.540 --> 02:05:35.860]   We do Mac Break Weekly.
[02:05:35.860 --> 02:05:37.660]   Whenever iOS today is done,
[02:05:37.660 --> 02:05:41.340]   which can vary widely as you've probably discovered.
[02:05:41.340 --> 02:05:43.780]   So if you wanted to watch live, my suggestion is
[02:05:43.780 --> 02:05:46.660]   tune in at 9 a.m. Pacific, noon Eastern.
[02:05:46.660 --> 02:05:49.580]   That's 1600 UTC.
[02:05:49.580 --> 02:05:51.260]   Start your day with iOS today,
[02:05:51.260 --> 02:05:53.860]   Mike Asargent and I with the latest iOS news,
[02:05:53.860 --> 02:05:57.180]   help tips, apps, then immediately afterwards,
[02:05:57.180 --> 02:06:00.580]   Mac Break Weekly, in theory, one would think
[02:06:00.580 --> 02:06:02.900]   two hours would be plenty of time for iOS today,
[02:06:02.900 --> 02:06:04.540]   but no, we rarely get on at 11.
[02:06:04.540 --> 02:06:05.660]   That's when we're supposed to.
[02:06:05.660 --> 02:06:08.420]   11 a.m. Pacific, 2 p.m. Eastern time.
[02:06:08.420 --> 02:06:10.380]   And then of course, immediately after it's security now.
[02:06:10.380 --> 02:06:13.220]   And I, you know what, leave it on, leave it running.
[02:06:13.220 --> 02:06:15.740]   You can, the live stream is at twit.tv/live,
[02:06:15.740 --> 02:06:17.700]   but all you have to do is ask your Echo
[02:06:17.700 --> 02:06:19.660]   or your Google Home device.
[02:06:19.660 --> 02:06:22.340]   I think you probably do it on a HomePod too.
[02:06:22.340 --> 02:06:24.540]   I just don't know the exact syntax,
[02:06:24.540 --> 02:06:26.860]   but something like, hey you,
[02:06:26.860 --> 02:06:31.180]   play Twit Live, and sometimes you have to say
[02:06:31.180 --> 02:06:33.900]   play Twit Live on TuneIn or something like that.
[02:06:33.900 --> 02:06:37.060]   And it'll just, you can just listen to us all day.
[02:06:37.060 --> 02:06:39.100]   You can also get on to man versions of the show
[02:06:39.100 --> 02:06:43.340]   at our website, twit.tv/mbw.
[02:06:43.340 --> 02:06:45.140]   If you're watching live,
[02:06:45.140 --> 02:06:47.540]   or anytime you're looking for a community somewhere
[02:06:47.540 --> 02:06:49.700]   to hang out, I know it could be a little lonely
[02:06:49.700 --> 02:06:52.180]   during this quarantine, we have a great chat room
[02:06:52.180 --> 02:06:53.500]   that's around the clock,
[02:06:53.500 --> 02:06:57.420]   irc.twit.tv, a little more active when there are shows on,
[02:06:57.420 --> 02:06:58.740]   but there's always somebody in there,
[02:06:58.740 --> 02:07:03.260]   irc.twit.tv, you can use your browser to go in there.
[02:07:03.260 --> 02:07:06.180]   My strong, but we're on YouTube too, we're everywhere.
[02:07:06.180 --> 02:07:10.180]   But my strong suggestion is you get an iPod program
[02:07:10.180 --> 02:07:12.340]   of your choice, there's so many great ones out there,
[02:07:12.340 --> 02:07:16.300]   pocket cast and overcast and stitcher and slacker
[02:07:16.300 --> 02:07:18.340]   and Google and Apple podcasts.
[02:07:18.340 --> 02:07:21.340]   Pick one you like, subscribe to Mac break weekly,
[02:07:21.340 --> 02:07:24.060]   that way you got it, it's in your pocket.
[02:07:24.060 --> 02:07:24.980]   Anytime you need it,
[02:07:24.980 --> 02:07:27.220]   you'll always have an episode you can listen to.
[02:07:27.220 --> 02:07:29.660]   Thank you everybody, now you gotta go back to work,
[02:07:29.660 --> 02:07:33.340]   or maybe just, it's time for Taco Tuesday, I don't know.
[02:07:33.340 --> 02:07:35.900]   I gotta say, you gotta go now.
[02:07:35.900 --> 02:07:36.740]   - Yeah, doesn't it?
[02:07:36.740 --> 02:07:39.500]   Yeah, break time is over.
[02:07:39.500 --> 02:07:40.340]   Bye bye.
[02:07:40.340 --> 02:07:42.940]   (upbeat music)
[02:07:42.940 --> 02:07:45.520]   (upbeat music)
[02:07:45.520 --> 02:07:50.520]   (upbeat music)
