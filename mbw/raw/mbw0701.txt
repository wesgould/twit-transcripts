[00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:33.280]   Snap those fingers. The show where we talk about the latest news from Apple, Renee Ritchie,
[00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:38.160]   is here from Montreal, host of Vector at imore.com/vector. Hello Renee.
[00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:43.040]   Hi Leo, it's great to be here again. Good to see you as always. Absolutely.
[00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:49.920]   Two Renee's left, Mr. Andrew Ennaco of the Boston Public Radio Ennaco.
[00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:55.440]   Good to see you. Only one so far, but we're working to bring other people from the old country.
[00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:59.920]   What was it? I'm one of those anchor babies. I'm beating like kimbles. I'm beeking hill.
[00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:06.320]   There was a whole, there was a saying about the fam Boston families. I'll look it up.
[00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:10.440]   Oh yes, Len Len, Len of the, the card where the, uh,
[00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:15.120]   Cabot's where the, yes, he's only the Cabot's and the Cabot's speak only to God. Only to God.
[00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:21.760]   That's exactly it. You knew it. He is from the Boston. Oh, and not because of Boston.
[00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:29.200]   Alex Lindsey is here of 090. I know. Media. Now I say 090, but it's 090.
[00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:31.840]   090, but we say it when I know. Yeah. It's easier to say.
[00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:37.920]   You know, John gets mad at me because, uh, you know, I do phone numbers like, you know,
[00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:44.560]   0209. And, and he says, there's no, oh, in the numeric system. He gets mad.
[00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:51.680]   Does he know about Condeicleo? Condeicle. Yeah. What was the song, Jenny? What's Jenny's number?
[00:02:52.160 --> 00:03:00.160]   867. Oh, nine. Oh nine. And that's Lori Gill. Who knows that song probably sings it with a
[00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:05.600]   sick burn. Her punk band. She's managing editor at I'm more. Hello, Lori. Hi, how's it going?
[00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:11.600]   I'm on all pink today on the hair. Can I just say how great all of us look today? We all look
[00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:15.680]   beautiful. We all look great. Thank you. Look marvelous.
[00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:21.040]   Nobody here is wearing a face mask. That's because we're all in our own.
[00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:27.440]   All in our own spaces. Although maybe we need a little, little face mask or like a rest mask.
[00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:32.560]   Oh, I mean, this is over. Yeah. QUE, kind of a mask. That kind of mask.
[00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:38.720]   Seaweed with charcoal. There you go. These are face masks that make you look like yourself.
[00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:44.000]   And also full space detection, Leo. Like if you're out there committing acts of freedom.
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.400]   Now, can I get my own face on the face mask or is it have to be some other purpose? Yes.
[00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:51.680]   But then they'll face ID, Leo. That's the whole point of this is not to look like you.
[00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:58.720]   Oh, who makes these? I want them. Right now, they're just being made kind of as an art project.
[00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:04.400]   But I could make it probably. Resting risk. That's enormous. Resting risk face.
[00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:12.640]   So face masks, of course, and that's nothing to joke about. Wow, that's amazing. Look at that.
[00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:19.920]   Look at that. It is a little weird. N95 respiratory masks that work. Oh, that's why you'd want it.
[00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:24.320]   So you can unlock your iPhone, work with your face recognition. I don't think that would work.
[00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:30.720]   Yeah, it shouldn't work. I've a job. No, I really want to find that with your iPhone or pixel,
[00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:35.120]   but poly with the other one. Let's order some Carson gets some get some made up.
[00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:40.000]   I've already put myself on their mailing list. No, no, they're not. They're launched.
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.760]   You can't with an N95 mask, the beard is a problem. This guy's got a beer.
[00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:48.320]   The bow tie. Okay. He's got a thin beard. He needs one with a bow tie bow tie mask.
[00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:54.400]   The reason we're talking massive, of course, is because we're laughing. We're whistling past the
[00:04:54.400 --> 00:05:01.280]   graveyards. Coronavirus slowly whittles away at the earth's population. No, it's not that bad yet,
[00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:08.240]   but it is whittling away at Apple's revenue. They put out a adjusted guidance saying,
[00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:13.280]   we might have, we might go fall. No new guidance. No new. Yeah. They're just not going to make the
[00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:18.240]   numbers. They're not saying what they're going to make. And this, this, the changes are so rapid.
[00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:22.080]   Like they thought it was leveling off. And then I started accelerating because they were adjusting
[00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:26.960]   how they were defining what was coronavirus. And we've talked about before how they just
[00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:30.240]   just no idea what's happening there. There's just not enough tests, not enough people. People
[00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:34.960]   being sent home. It's a complete, it's not a complete mystery, but it's a large form mystery.
[00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:40.000]   Some of that, you think some of that China's on the government's unwillingness to be too
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.880]   forthcoming about what's really going on. And inability at this point, but the bigger thing for
[00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:48.640]   Apple is that they already said that this was going to impact them. They just had no idea how
[00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:53.840]   much. And now they're saying that it's going to have a far bigger, longer term impact. And Apple
[00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:57.520]   got out ahead of this. Like they stated they're earnings late and now they're not late, but close
[00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:01.920]   to when this happened, like they said at the end of January, this happened beginning of February.
[00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:06.640]   By this happened, I mean the explosion of more information about it. And there's going to be
[00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:10.400]   my guess is there going to be company after company coming out after Apple with very similar
[00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:16.080]   sort of warnings. Yeah, mobile swag. They said this. They their plants in China are slowed down.
[00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:22.400]   Yeah, Airbus is having trouble. 150 million workers are being restricted from just being
[00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:26.160]   able to go back to work. And the only the only factories that are really an operation,
[00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:29.360]   a full operation, are of course, ones that are making medical supplies and dust masks,
[00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:34.160]   including Foxconn, which switched from iPhone manufactured to mask manufacture and what
[00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:40.080]   least one of us plans. Yeah, Apple said we don't make anything in Wuhan, the epicenter of the
[00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:48.320]   crisis. But and Mark Gurman in his Bloomberg story said it looks like they're still going to
[00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:54.160]   announce the new $400 iPhone in March as planned. But you have to think that that's going to be the
[00:06:54.160 --> 00:07:00.240]   phone most impacted by production slowdowns. Well, I know that I finally got one of the new phones
[00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:03.920]   and getting a 256 was almost impossible. I don't know if it's connected, but they were like, oh,
[00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:08.400]   we can't, you know, like Verizon couldn't get it. Yeah, they were like, we don't have any of those.
[00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:13.840]   And Gurman also says the iPad Pro will will be released in in March.
[00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:18.640]   Well, there's two problems. It has to be enough to meet supply. And the other is people in China
[00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:22.560]   can't go out and buy them. I mean, those stores were closed, and they're just now starting up.
[00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:27.040]   So they're being impacted both at the factory to be able to create supply and in their second or
[00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:31.040]   third biggest market, depending on any given quarter in people actually not being able to go out and
[00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:36.320]   buy them. So it's a double sort of whammy for their numbers. Yeah. Gurman says they're still
[00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:40.960]   produced or they have produced enough SE twos. Will it be called the SE two? You think Renee?
[00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:45.120]   No, I don't know what it will be called. I don't think they'll use. Yeah. It's the
[00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:52.080]   the successor to the very successful SE of $400 iPhone. No, it's not. It's not.
[00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:59.360]   It's not the same size. Come on. Okay, it's not a close. It's an A13. It's the size of what is it?
[00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:03.920]   The size of an iPhone eight? It's the successor to the eight. Yeah. People, everybody out there
[00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:09.360]   that's listening that is a fan of the iPhone SE, you know where I'm coming from. The whatever
[00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:15.360]   you like the iPhone five not an iPhone SE two. It's not even close. The SE was on the iPhone five
[00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:21.360]   platform, right? You like that size? Yes. Yes. Yes. I'm a huge fan of the four inch phone. I love,
[00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:26.720]   love, love it. And this phone will not look like that. So it's the iPhone eight, it's a success
[00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:34.000]   or it's more like that. Would you consider ordering the Samsung Z flip? Oh, man. Yes. I want that phone
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:40.080]   so bad. It matches your hair. I think I know. I have more. He can't be trusted with it. He keeps
[00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:46.800]   dropping it in front of Leo. Yes. I know. I was so bummed because Daniel Rubino and Twitt had one.
[00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:53.440]   I said, how'd you get one? You must have context. He said, no, I just went to Best Buy and they
[00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:59.360]   have and then I went to Best Buy. I thought, well, that's what I did. I ordered at 908 Pacific time,
[00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:03.920]   eight minutes after the sales supposedly started and they were already sold out. I went to our
[00:09:03.920 --> 00:09:10.960]   local Best Buy. I said, yeah, we had to. So there's a charm. Yeah. Rubino loves his.
[00:09:10.960 --> 00:09:17.280]   I didn't even check back in a week. Let them sort out the issues for a couple of years.
[00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:24.800]   Oh, yeah. Oh, any sensible person. But I don't think anybody who loves this iPhone five size
[00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:32.480]   phone was sensible. So no, no, it's all about the way it looks. Absolutely. Yeah. You are using an
[00:09:32.480 --> 00:09:38.800]   iPhone SE right now? I used the iPhone SE until the iPhone 10 came out and that ended up being
[00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:44.960]   sort of my compromise. I didn't love it. It's still too big that size is still too big for me.
[00:09:44.960 --> 00:09:51.120]   It's a lot smaller than the current. But it fits. It's a little it's more narrow. So that feels better
[00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:57.360]   in my hand. But yeah, like if there was another if a new SE came out, actually, I've had this
[00:09:57.360 --> 00:10:02.640]   discussion. The size that I have grown comfortable with, you know, I have the 11 pro now.
[00:10:02.640 --> 00:10:09.280]   I'm so used to that size of a display that I'm not sure I could actually go back to the four inch
[00:10:09.280 --> 00:10:16.160]   size. The 12 pro is going to be smaller. The 12 pro is going to be smaller than the 11 pro.
[00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:20.960]   Yeah. So you'll get a little bit of that. Yeah, that'll be something would happen.
[00:10:20.960 --> 00:10:25.600]   Ever make a folding phone. We talked about this last week. Oh, yeah, they prototyped it.
[00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:28.640]   They still don't think it would be poor typing it for 10 years. They just don't think it's a
[00:10:28.640 --> 00:10:33.760]   they think it's like a kindergarten going on to first grade level technology in terms of like
[00:10:33.760 --> 00:10:37.200]   when they when they sell a phone, they want you to be able to use that phone for three to five years,
[00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:40.560]   be able to hand it down to other people. And they just don't think that the durability aspect of
[00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:44.160]   it is there yet. And I think we're seeing that play out in the market. It's great if like you
[00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:48.080]   have the money and you want to and you want to get one and it's super fun. And I love them too.
[00:10:48.080 --> 00:10:52.640]   But I would not tell like anyone in my family who plans on holding on to it for three to five
[00:10:52.640 --> 00:10:56.800]   years to get one. Yeah, it's the perfect thing for Samsung to make given that they make like 20
[00:10:56.800 --> 00:11:01.920]   different phones. This can be just one of them when Apple decides to endorse a design by saying
[00:11:01.920 --> 00:11:06.960]   we're selling exactly three we're introducing three new phones this year. One of them is going
[00:11:06.960 --> 00:11:12.720]   to be this folding technology that is lost still largely unprecedented and the bugs are still being
[00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:17.760]   worked out. That's really not what Apple does. But as soon as usual as soon as some other cup as
[00:11:17.760 --> 00:11:23.840]   as soon as the technology is absolutely there and more importantly there are numbers indicating
[00:11:23.840 --> 00:11:28.320]   that there is a really big demand for it and Apple consumers want them. Oh, absolutely.
[00:11:28.320 --> 00:11:36.720]   So, yeah, yeah, it's the same as the as the the phablets like originally.
[00:11:36.720 --> 00:11:41.600]   That's what I was going to say to be on AT&T when then everybody who was on AT&T had one.
[00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:46.960]   They had to go to Verizon and everybody who wanted a smaller than six inch phone had an iPhone but
[00:11:46.960 --> 00:11:50.480]   no one who wanted a bigger than six inch phones they had to make the the plus phone.
[00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:53.280]   Yeah, when the note came out people mocked it. The Samsung.
[00:11:53.280 --> 00:11:58.320]   And now everybody makes them. You wouldn't only use the term phablet anymore. They're all phablets
[00:11:58.320 --> 00:12:02.640]   at least to Laurie. Yeah. One Apple also makes smaller than that. But now you can't make small
[00:12:02.640 --> 00:12:06.160]   phones anymore because the chips are too big and hot and they can't run. Oh, is that part of it?
[00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:09.280]   Oh, that's interesting. That's the main reason because they took the bigger.
[00:12:09.280 --> 00:12:15.520]   The bigger phones were a real big pro and a real big con. They took the bigger hotter LTE modems
[00:12:15.520 --> 00:12:19.360]   which were coming out at the time and then they used the the bigger screen sort of shellac over
[00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:23.760]   them. But then they go, Oh, look at the thermal envelope and power limit the bigger power
[00:12:23.760 --> 00:12:27.600]   constraints we have on these. Let's just make those chips faster and hotter faster and hotter.
[00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:30.960]   One also. And now if you try to just do that in a small one, yeah, just shut down.
[00:12:30.960 --> 00:12:35.040]   I think about the battery size. Yeah. I didn't even think of that. Okay, of course that makes sense.
[00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:43.280]   But of course. Battery says a funny thing because you make the screen bigger. You need more battery.
[00:12:43.280 --> 00:12:47.760]   So I mean, I think your SE got great battery life, right? You got you could make a new chip.
[00:12:47.760 --> 00:12:51.120]   It would just be it wouldn't be a $400 phone anymore. Like you could totally make a new
[00:12:51.120 --> 00:12:56.320]   iPhone SE. It would just require a different a processor and couldn't do the A13. And then it's
[00:12:56.320 --> 00:13:01.520]   not $400 anymore. Yeah, the A13 is too big for a little phone. Is that the problem? Yes. Okay.
[00:13:01.520 --> 00:13:07.360]   But I think that Apple could do it because they they're still they're still putting into the
[00:13:07.360 --> 00:13:14.160]   into the product line. Phones with chipsets that are a lot older than what three,
[00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:18.720]   I think the old chip says three years old, four years old. So I don't think that it's a problem
[00:13:18.720 --> 00:13:25.600]   that can't be worked around. They just have to make sure that they test out every single platform
[00:13:25.600 --> 00:13:29.840]   or every single app to make sure that there's nothing that will absolutely not work on this device.
[00:13:29.840 --> 00:13:35.360]   I think that but I think that consumers are at the point right now where they're putting that
[00:13:35.360 --> 00:13:40.720]   manufacturer putting a way more power into these phones that any app or any user can really access.
[00:13:40.720 --> 00:13:45.840]   And if you were to tell somebody, I'm going to put in this is this is going to be a low power
[00:13:45.840 --> 00:13:52.160]   version of the iPhone in the sense that you will definitely get you will definitely get twice the
[00:13:52.160 --> 00:13:56.800]   battery life or we're putting in a smaller package so that you'll get three years ago
[00:13:56.800 --> 00:14:01.600]   performance, but you will be getting when the two thirds the size. I think the data
[00:14:01.600 --> 00:14:05.760]   could be a sale. That's like their iPhone C, their iPhone 5 C sale where it seems like
[00:14:05.760 --> 00:14:10.480]   just for Apple people they when they got the SE a big part of it was smaller phone current specs
[00:14:10.480 --> 00:14:15.440]   and now with this new whatever the iPhone 9 or whatever is called it's you know home button but
[00:14:15.440 --> 00:14:19.040]   the current specs and they seem to people really want the current specs from Apple. They don't get
[00:14:19.040 --> 00:14:22.800]   them. They don't get them. A lot of things changed in the past five years. I think that the
[00:14:22.800 --> 00:14:27.680]   we really have seen an inflection of people really really want to spend less money on phones.
[00:14:27.680 --> 00:14:33.840]   There's a lot more resistance to the $1000 $1100 $1200 phone. It's I think a lot of
[00:14:33.840 --> 00:14:36.720]   lot has changed. I'd love to see Apple be a little bit more experimental.
[00:14:36.720 --> 00:14:41.120]   I think that I think that part of the problem when when you're rolling out new technology is the
[00:14:41.120 --> 00:14:46.640]   you know kind of the separation of your of your audience and so having a lot of people that's
[00:14:46.640 --> 00:14:52.000]   one of the advantages of developing for an iPhone is that is that a lot of people have similar
[00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:57.280]   people buying new phones have a similar experience and I think that especially as someone who's
[00:14:57.280 --> 00:15:01.200]   doing a bunch of AR tests right now I can tell you that I'm using up all the phone.
[00:15:01.200 --> 00:15:10.880]   So right now we're the test that I'm doing I'm putting in you know 2 million polygons which to me
[00:15:10.880 --> 00:15:16.480]   is absurd because I so when I started working in real time games my budget was 20,000 polygons
[00:15:16.480 --> 00:15:20.560]   for an entire level and now I'm doing 2 million polygons for one object that I'm throwing in
[00:15:20.560 --> 00:15:26.000]   you know throwing out there but that's about as far as the phone can go you know and and so as we
[00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:30.880]   start to see more of that you know coming in the not too distant future I mean we're already
[00:15:30.880 --> 00:15:34.080]   starting to see some AR stuff I think that you know there's going a lot of people looking to feel
[00:15:34.080 --> 00:15:38.800]   left out if they don't have a processor that can that can manage that. That's still that's still
[00:15:38.800 --> 00:15:44.720]   outside of the edge augmented reality for now is still in a couple of cases a really good game
[00:15:44.720 --> 00:15:49.280]   or a really good demo but it's not the sort of thing that people count on day in and day out that
[00:15:49.280 --> 00:15:54.720]   a few that it's going to be a different filter. I'll argue that's because the the imagination of
[00:15:54.720 --> 00:15:58.560]   most people doing AR has been pretty like let's do something really cool rather than let's do
[00:15:58.560 --> 00:16:02.800]   something really useful and you know that's how you get that's how you raise money it's just not a
[00:16:02.800 --> 00:16:08.800]   way that you build a platform and so I think that we're probably this year see more sensible uses
[00:16:08.800 --> 00:16:13.360]   of of AR that is kind of more of a day-to-day direction and some of it has to do with
[00:16:13.360 --> 00:16:18.160]   someone has to do with knowing where the phone is and so that you know that's going to help a lot
[00:16:18.160 --> 00:16:24.400]   too. Yeah but it's it's like it's still something that if you if you have if consumers have the
[00:16:24.400 --> 00:16:28.880]   ability to vote on these features let's say that Apple did have 20 different models of phone not
[00:16:28.880 --> 00:16:32.720]   nothing saying that that would be a good thing for them to do but if they if they had a table that
[00:16:32.720 --> 00:16:40.080]   said for those of you who want to maximize battery life and portability they would basically say I
[00:16:40.080 --> 00:16:46.000]   really want Instagram I don't even care about having real life Mickey Mouse ears as I as I do my video
[00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:53.040]   I want Instagram I want Facebook I want office I want I want my my email they wouldn't necessarily
[00:16:53.040 --> 00:16:58.880]   they're AR I I know there's a lot of possibilities there I know that Tim keeps it's one of the few
[00:16:58.880 --> 00:17:04.960]   things that Tim keeps acts explicitly speaking about in terms of future stuff that Apple would
[00:17:04.960 --> 00:17:11.280]   like to be very very active in but I'm saying that right now there is no really good use case
[00:17:11.280 --> 00:17:17.040]   Google is really the only company that I can think of that's really that's really waist deep in saying
[00:17:17.040 --> 00:17:22.560]   here is a version of Google Maps for interactive street direction so I just believe that if if
[00:17:22.560 --> 00:17:26.960]   the engineers are saying well gosh it would be nice to make this thing smaller it would be nice
[00:17:26.960 --> 00:17:30.640]   to have better battery life would be nice to do this that the other but that would compromise
[00:17:30.640 --> 00:17:36.480]   its ability to do really really intense augmented reality I think that would be a very bad
[00:17:36.480 --> 00:17:38.480]   situation.
[00:17:38.480 --> 00:17:44.880]   Well consumers have already voted on whether they want a a cheaper more expensive inexpensive
[00:17:44.880 --> 00:17:51.200]   version of the iPhone though if they did then the the SE would have outsold the the 11 but they
[00:17:51.200 --> 00:17:57.360]   consumers have definitely voted on the larger phone community has definitely voted that they
[00:17:57.360 --> 00:18:02.000]   would much rather see really good five or six hundred dollar phones than really amazing thousand
[00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:08.400]   dollars. The iPhone 11 has outsold every other phone consistently since it's an apple doesn't offer
[00:18:08.400 --> 00:18:13.440]   a full range but Apple Apple Apple doesn't need the iPhone 11 the the iPhone 11 is only competing
[00:18:13.440 --> 00:18:18.000]   with the iPhone 11 when you're talking about the people who have people when I'm talking about
[00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:22.720]   people who want the larger iPhone market where someone walks into a store or walks into a market
[00:18:22.720 --> 00:18:27.280]   saying I could buy any phone I want with any operating system the velocity of five hundred
[00:18:27.280 --> 00:18:33.200]   or phones the iPhone is the iPhone we got enough people in our own thank you there was a really
[00:18:33.200 --> 00:18:38.080]   good British British ad campaign they did they done Humvee tried to explain advertising to people
[00:18:38.080 --> 00:18:42.160]   and he said people don't buy electricity they buy soap operas they don't buy insurance they buy
[00:18:42.160 --> 00:18:47.040]   white sofas and it's the same thing with this the predominant usage of this thing is photo filters
[00:18:47.040 --> 00:18:51.200]   and camera effects and if you can't use the camera effects and photo filters that your friends are
[00:18:51.200 --> 00:18:55.440]   using you feel bad and nobody likes to feel bad about their purchase that's not really intensive
[00:18:55.440 --> 00:19:00.800]   and those and yeah those are really intense so anything that's the that's the ones that people
[00:19:00.800 --> 00:19:05.760]   use anything that adds a convolution kernel so so anything that's boring anything that's
[00:19:05.760 --> 00:19:12.160]   doing anything that's you know it's a convolution kernel so the math the math in the in the in the
[00:19:12.160 --> 00:19:18.720]   images if i'm just taking one pixel to the other pixel that's really cheap you know to do so that
[00:19:18.720 --> 00:19:24.400]   putting one image over top of another image and just doing math between the pixels is cheap once I
[00:19:24.400 --> 00:19:28.320]   start talking to the pixels next to it that's using a convolution kernel and so once I start
[00:19:28.320 --> 00:19:33.040]   doing blurs I start doing you know kind of effects to the image you know the reason that a lot of
[00:19:33.040 --> 00:19:36.720]   these things are very seamless is because we've a really powerful processor and those processes
[00:19:36.720 --> 00:19:40.080]   and those things are rendering you know and because they're they're rendering and we have to
[00:19:40.080 --> 00:19:43.440]   remember that we're rendering some of these in real time and some of these with 4k video
[00:19:43.440 --> 00:19:49.840]   in real time it I mean as someone who started doing this a long time ago it's kind of amazing
[00:19:49.840 --> 00:19:53.920]   what the phone does but how come you never told me about convolution kernels you know I did you
[00:19:53.920 --> 00:19:57.440]   ask Leo holding out I've been holding out I've been told you about deep translation
[00:19:57.440 --> 00:20:00.480]   I don't know if I remember that either
[00:20:00.480 --> 00:20:05.920]   man I feel like there's a little one that's open up first we talked about moisturizing and
[00:20:05.920 --> 00:20:09.440]   now we're talking about convolution if you're going to learn about convolution kernels there's a I
[00:20:09.440 --> 00:20:14.560]   think the I think the calculate plug-in is still in Photoshop which is hidden is like one of the
[00:20:14.560 --> 00:20:19.920]   other things and you have a little matrix and you can draw you can actually put the numbers in of
[00:20:19.920 --> 00:20:25.520]   the of the calculation for the convolution kernel and it's a great way to understand how it works but
[00:20:25.520 --> 00:20:31.520]   convolution is using a kernel to extract certain features from an input image oh that's clear as
[00:20:31.520 --> 00:20:36.640]   mud the bottom generally when you're talking about that you're talking about making calculations
[00:20:36.640 --> 00:20:43.760]   you know from the images from the pixels around that given pixels so the pixels the pixels and
[00:20:43.760 --> 00:20:49.200]   result is some combination of all the pixels around it which can be the ones that are immediately
[00:20:49.200 --> 00:20:54.240]   neighboring it or the ones as you open that up like so a Gaussian blur that's seven pixels you
[00:20:54.240 --> 00:21:00.880]   know whatever is going out that many pixels to average the the color value of that that given
[00:21:00.880 --> 00:21:06.320]   pixel so and I'm for those of you who actually do this for a living I'm simplifying this I know
[00:21:06.320 --> 00:21:10.480]   well all I know is it a kernel don't know that a filter so I'm just saying people understand
[00:21:10.480 --> 00:21:16.160]   that it's just cool I just read that okay the kernel is not a filter but the filter is
[00:21:16.160 --> 00:21:20.160]   never felt so stupid in my life well believe it was like most people don't know what this is but
[00:21:20.160 --> 00:21:23.360]   they know that their phone doesn't have night mode and why does the other phone have it and not my
[00:21:23.360 --> 00:21:28.240]   phone convolution kernels well every like all the stuff that goes into making all of these
[00:21:28.240 --> 00:21:32.080]   computational features that we just want you know we just want it to have like do they care about
[00:21:32.080 --> 00:21:36.320]   segment of semantic rendering though they just they just they hear the word deep fusion and walk
[00:21:36.320 --> 00:21:40.240]   and I can't take sweater photos like my friend can oh well so all the computational
[00:21:40.240 --> 00:21:45.200]   photography I mean a lot of those things are all using some pretty complex math now that I see
[00:21:45.200 --> 00:21:51.920]   the formula I think I understand that now a lot better now it's geez I mean I mean it's a given
[00:21:51.920 --> 00:21:56.560]   it's the Google blog has great expectations for a lot of the stuff this is why as much as I love
[00:21:56.560 --> 00:22:00.640]   computer programming I will never be a professional programmer because I look at this and then I
[00:22:00.640 --> 00:22:07.040]   just go my eyes blur I don't even I don't it's just simple like super interesting to read about
[00:22:07.040 --> 00:22:11.120]   the calculus so here so you can actually type these in so just so you know you can type these
[00:22:11.120 --> 00:22:16.880]   numbers in in the calculate I mean that matrix is probably where he generated these images yeah
[00:22:16.880 --> 00:22:22.080]   that little matrix is available in Photoshop uh-huh in the I believe it's in the other filters
[00:22:22.080 --> 00:22:26.320]   that calculate so you could actually manually give it type these in you'll get these effects
[00:22:26.960 --> 00:22:33.440]   this matrix okay so is the center number of the matrix the actual image and then these the edges
[00:22:33.440 --> 00:22:38.960]   the actual pixel I should say and the image uh the ones around it are other pixels right so
[00:22:38.960 --> 00:22:46.080]   okay well that's not so complicated right that's okay for yourself lepa it gets more complicated
[00:22:46.080 --> 00:22:50.080]   because as you start seeing these unsharp masks and Gaussian blurs that are wider you know you're
[00:22:50.080 --> 00:22:56.720]   not so what you're talking about is the image by pixel and the surrounding pixels if the image
[00:22:56.720 --> 00:23:01.920]   pixel is one and the rest are zero then it's exactly as the image was originally yeah it's when you
[00:23:01.920 --> 00:23:07.920]   start modifying the edges actually in the middle too because edge detection would have a zero
[00:23:07.920 --> 00:23:12.400]   for the pixel and then you'd have numbers around the outside all right I get it
[00:23:12.400 --> 00:23:18.720]   that was easy I don't know why that was so complicated this is interesting actually
[00:23:18.720 --> 00:23:25.120]   well I remember hearing uh when the null brothers first wrote Photoshop that the key to Photoshop
[00:23:25.120 --> 00:23:31.280]   was was this was these plugins these these yeah right which John did most of the under yeah John
[00:23:31.280 --> 00:23:40.560]   know understood that the modifications that's that the Jason never mind uh so why can't we have
[00:23:40.560 --> 00:23:45.520]   an se again is that uh you wouldn't be able to do a lot of these camera effects if you really
[00:23:45.520 --> 00:23:49.920]   started going down to like an a 10 or an a eight or an a 11 processor you wouldn't be able to get
[00:23:49.920 --> 00:23:56.800]   some of the some of the computational photography would no longer be valid but not a standpoint though
[00:23:56.800 --> 00:24:03.280]   too from a consumer standpoint though it's it's not even about it when it is about like what you
[00:24:03.280 --> 00:24:08.480]   can or can't do with the phone but if I'm going to buy a new phone and for four hundred dollars I
[00:24:08.480 --> 00:24:15.120]   can buy a phone that's basically the same thing as a phone from five years ago or for two hundred
[00:24:15.120 --> 00:24:21.040]   dollars more I can buy a phone that's today's tech standard I'm gonna go with that one yeah
[00:24:21.040 --> 00:24:26.640]   it's just even not even to dig into the details of it but just from you know a person going to buy
[00:24:26.640 --> 00:24:33.680]   a phone it doesn't matter if it's a brand new se if all the specs inside it are still from three
[00:24:33.680 --> 00:24:37.520]   years ago then we're gonna look at that phone like it's three years old the other thing is like
[00:24:37.520 --> 00:24:41.040]   then you have people like like my my wife finally upgraded her phone because every time she sent
[00:24:41.040 --> 00:24:46.720]   me a picture of the kids I would text back going you need a new phone you need a new phone like
[00:24:46.720 --> 00:24:51.680]   like I was like like she did honestly she didn't care and I might question what you but after
[00:24:51.680 --> 00:24:55.680]   you say Laurie because I don't know people if people know that the guts are three years old but
[00:24:55.680 --> 00:24:58.560]   I think that we're not looking at that they're saying well that black slap of glass when they
[00:24:58.560 --> 00:25:03.840]   have them they don't buy them they do maybe later their their spouse says what's wrong with your
[00:25:03.840 --> 00:25:07.200]   picture well and the thing is you start looking at a new phone she saw them as soon as you start
[00:25:07.200 --> 00:25:11.840]   taking the new pictures she was like oh I can't believe I but which she is not buying the new phone
[00:25:11.840 --> 00:25:17.040]   would she have noticed if you hadn't messaged her every does well she doesn't she doesn't spend
[00:25:17.040 --> 00:25:20.320]   a lot of time my wife doesn't spend a lot of time on social media so she probably wouldn't see a
[00:25:20.320 --> 00:25:25.280]   lot of other things but I bet you normal you know I was in a Verizon store talk about normal people
[00:25:25.280 --> 00:25:30.640]   I was in a Verizon store yesterday and they live in a different world than you and me my mom still
[00:25:30.640 --> 00:25:39.680]   uses a razor the world of carrier incentives yeah and the world of off-brand products that I'd never
[00:25:39.680 --> 00:25:46.000]   you know that's they have like weird smart watches with names I've never heard of right I mean they
[00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:50.560]   it's like it's a different universe that they live it's a J-phone it's fine just buy it right
[00:25:50.560 --> 00:25:56.320]   and I think that I love it that is important for us as as journalists early adopters you know that
[00:25:56.320 --> 00:26:00.720]   we are kind of in a different kind of live in a different slightly different world in the rest of
[00:26:00.720 --> 00:26:06.640]   the yeah it is important to like when you're on the subway and if you're if you ride buses make
[00:26:06.640 --> 00:26:10.080]   sure you pay attention to what kind of phones people are using on subways and buses because
[00:26:10.080 --> 00:26:15.360]   that's the one that's I think it's the one place where people of really wide economic
[00:26:15.360 --> 00:26:20.800]   range from people who are making six figures but the subway is the easiest way to get from
[00:26:20.800 --> 00:26:26.880]   when a to point B to people who don't have cars you don't it's you see people using a lot of
[00:26:26.880 --> 00:26:31.120]   older phones you see a lot of new phones that you can recognize aren't at the very very top of the
[00:26:31.120 --> 00:26:39.040]   range and there's a reason why Google for instance did so well with a $500 version of their pixel
[00:26:39.040 --> 00:26:45.200]   phone now the the iPhone market is not the same as all the other markets but there is a case to be
[00:26:45.200 --> 00:26:50.800]   made that is exciting as these 1100 1200 dollar phones are it's also very very exciting to the
[00:26:50.800 --> 00:26:56.480]   marketplace to have an affordable solution that that does not mean let's have a let's have a
[00:26:56.480 --> 00:27:04.640]   solar on chip powered of LCD flip phone but it does mean that they're it's easy to mistake
[00:27:04.640 --> 00:27:08.960]   all this wonderful augmented reality and all this wonderful nights night mode and computational
[00:27:08.960 --> 00:27:13.520]   photography for things that are non-negotiable and important things to have on a phone they're
[00:27:13.520 --> 00:27:17.920]   going to be people who walk into the Verizon store walk into the mall kiosk and they just say
[00:27:17.920 --> 00:27:23.440]   I just I dropped there they're not they're they're not unhappy with their phone they're unhappy with
[00:27:23.440 --> 00:27:28.320]   the fact that they dropped it in the toilet and now they need to buy another one and if they see
[00:27:28.320 --> 00:27:32.560]   one that does what they think is substantially what their old phone could do that will save them 300
[00:27:32.560 --> 00:27:35.920]   bucks they're going to a lot of these people are going to be going for something to cost 300 bucks
[00:27:35.920 --> 00:27:39.760]   all I'm saying and I think the question is three quarters and the question really is is that a
[00:27:39.760 --> 00:27:44.000]   market that apple wants to compete in you know and I don't know if it's they don't have to do this
[00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:46.880]   they can force people there's a lot more people going to McDonald's and Ruth Chris but Ruth
[00:27:46.880 --> 00:27:50.800]   Chris couldn't produce McDonald's and right at that price like you know an apple may not be able to
[00:27:50.800 --> 00:27:56.720]   produce a solid phone at at a discount it just may not be how they're built you know and and so I
[00:27:56.720 --> 00:28:01.680]   think that you know BMW can't produce a you know $6,000 car either you know and so so there's a
[00:28:01.680 --> 00:28:06.800]   flip phones too because like Samsung can lose uh ungodly amounts of nation state money on all
[00:28:06.800 --> 00:28:09.840]   these phones and it's not a major part of their business because they're fine they make oil rigs
[00:28:09.840 --> 00:28:14.560]   and bathrooms it's great apple if they make a bad mistake if they bet wrong that's a substantial
[00:28:14.560 --> 00:28:21.040]   part of their business well but also Samsung will take a flutter on it they they they do they don't
[00:28:21.040 --> 00:28:26.720]   have the they they have the the position of making a lot of phones that aren't really that thrilling
[00:28:26.720 --> 00:28:33.280]   they make a lot of really boy so many theft up when you get a free phone at the phone store for
[00:28:33.280 --> 00:28:37.840]   signing up it's almost always a crap Samsung phone right right has Facebook on it and you're fine
[00:28:37.840 --> 00:28:43.440]   right right whereas every time I think I think uh I do think that Alex is right that apple it's
[00:28:43.440 --> 00:28:49.440]   apple may not have optimized itself to figure out how to be a thrifty manufacturer but also that
[00:28:49.440 --> 00:28:56.240]   it would be a huge deal if they if they were to even explicitly do a two hour long keynote in which
[00:28:56.240 --> 00:29:02.480]   one hour and 48 minutes of this keynote is Tim and all kinds of other engineers saying we just
[00:29:02.480 --> 00:29:07.760]   happen to think that flip phones are really really cool and we know that there's some people
[00:29:07.760 --> 00:29:13.520]   who love to have like something that's very very new so we are explicitly telling you everybody
[00:29:13.520 --> 00:29:18.320]   that there's going to be some problems with this one but if you want to help us develop it
[00:29:18.320 --> 00:29:23.200]   by all means be one of these early people but again we're saying there's going to be problems
[00:29:23.200 --> 00:29:29.120]   with it as soon as these phones ship and 1% of them have problems it's going to be apple is doomed
[00:29:29.120 --> 00:29:33.600]   like oh gosh this would never have happened under Steve so yeah there there are higher
[00:29:33.600 --> 00:29:38.000]   expectations for apple both internally and externally and I think that sometimes it makes it harder
[00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:44.880]   for apple to do part of the natural evolution of engineering which is we have to ship but we have
[00:29:44.880 --> 00:29:49.120]   to ship because we're not going to figure out how to make it perfect inside the campus we're only
[00:29:49.120 --> 00:29:54.240]   going to make it perfect once we start getting feedback from customers and damaged phones back
[00:29:54.240 --> 00:30:02.160]   into the house so according to a website I don't know how sketch it is imore.com
[00:30:02.160 --> 00:30:09.280]   actually it's a rumor that comes from another website that probably is pretty sketch March 31st
[00:30:09.280 --> 00:30:17.120]   is the date for the apple. I don't know so here's the thing it's it's sketch in the fact that
[00:30:18.560 --> 00:30:25.120]   that's a total iPhone ticker it's a it's a prediction based on the past so the last
[00:30:25.120 --> 00:30:32.160]   Tuesday of yeah yeah it's not I don't think this is some kind of amazing week as much as it's just
[00:30:32.160 --> 00:30:39.600]   well apple usually holds a march event the last Tuesday in in March and that's the last Tuesday in
[00:30:39.600 --> 00:30:45.520]   March so if they're gonna hold an event it's gonna be March 31st so it really kind of it's less
[00:30:45.520 --> 00:30:50.320]   exciting than it sounds you know it's really just kind of a that they have sources with an apple
[00:30:50.320 --> 00:30:57.440]   that have confirmed that however and that well see this is unclear according to the site sources
[00:30:57.440 --> 00:31:01.680]   with an apple i can't read German so i'm reading your translation larry according to the site
[00:31:01.680 --> 00:31:05.120]   sources with an apple have confirmed the details and revealed that the company will be hosting a
[00:31:05.120 --> 00:31:10.880]   march event where it will reveal the successor to the beloved iPhone se Tuesday March 31st with
[00:31:10.880 --> 00:31:16.960]   the launch of the new phone following Friday on April 3rd so is it is it just based on past
[00:31:16.960 --> 00:31:24.240]   performance or is it that they do have some information i did so you can tell that i didn't
[00:31:24.240 --> 00:31:29.360]   write this particular news piece because i wouldn't have said this successor to the beloved iPhone se
[00:31:29.360 --> 00:31:37.520]   yes yes you know better than that yeah yeah i don't know yeah it ain't an se Joe yeah exactly
[00:31:38.160 --> 00:31:44.240]   well iPhone no annoying vorshtolung on the Mars it's a successor to the iPhone as the price point
[00:31:44.240 --> 00:31:51.920]   yeah yeah not to the point factor what will they name it nine nine that's what the iPhone
[00:31:51.920 --> 00:31:57.120]   mother of dragons i'm gonna stick with us this site saying the iPhone nine i'm gonna say it's
[00:31:57.120 --> 00:32:02.160]   they're gonna call it iPhone turtle show just literally like Phil and Jaws and Kyan can walk
[00:32:02.160 --> 00:32:06.160]   up to the system and put in any name they want they'll just do that based on what they think they'll
[00:32:06.160 --> 00:32:12.000]   will sell the most phones right i know we're having a discussion about that though and there's
[00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:16.640]   there's this idea that i think is a good one not that apple would do it but
[00:32:16.640 --> 00:32:23.360]   that the nine or or se two or whatever you want to call it would just it would be the first in the
[00:32:23.360 --> 00:32:29.840]   line of iPhones that just stop having a number associated with it or an extra name associated
[00:32:29.840 --> 00:32:34.720]   with it they do this with i've had right and and with mac they just don't they don't have
[00:32:34.720 --> 00:32:39.600]   another title they're either based on their size or they're based on the year that they came out
[00:32:39.600 --> 00:32:46.080]   and it makes it actually a little easier to determine you know which which device you're talking
[00:32:46.080 --> 00:32:51.840]   about but also harder to figure out which model you have exactly it's someone who has a lot of
[00:32:51.840 --> 00:32:56.000]   these it's so confusing and frustrating like i just like i just wish you'd give them a number
[00:32:56.000 --> 00:33:00.560]   because like color on the radio show said oh gosh because i said we'll get the three to 29
[00:33:00.560 --> 00:33:06.080]   dollar ipad she said well what what do they call that i said this the ipad right it's not
[00:33:06.080 --> 00:33:10.960]   if the ipad seventh generation two thousand well that's not going to help her at all that's
[00:33:10.960 --> 00:33:15.600]   like if it's like if nissan called everything cars car the car yeah i don't
[00:33:15.600 --> 00:33:19.760]   call it home in a way they do because a toiota corolla is always a toyota corolla
[00:33:19.760 --> 00:33:24.800]   you you say the model year but we don't even i mean i don't even know that's well that's
[00:33:24.800 --> 00:33:30.480]   still that's like bmw is like oh i've got an m3 okay but is it an m3 body style whatever it's
[00:33:30.480 --> 00:33:38.800]   the m3's yeah so i didn't know about this but in digit times they uh they said the upcoming
[00:33:38.800 --> 00:33:48.000]   air pod pro light earphones what the hell's that i don't think this is that was just them
[00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:51.520]   legs yeah okay randomly accurate rumor site digit times
[00:33:51.520 --> 00:33:57.520]   insane air light and internet explodes an entry level version of the air pods pro which are
[00:33:57.520 --> 00:34:04.400]   not entry level the air pods yeah pogs right so like the entry level version of the air pods pro
[00:34:04.400 --> 00:34:09.840]   would be the air pods yeah yeah so the like the one thing that i can think is maybe this is based
[00:34:09.840 --> 00:34:15.040]   on some sort of information that maybe they're going to start making air pods with air tips
[00:34:15.040 --> 00:34:19.360]   that's not air pods pro there's a lot of things that the pro model have like active noise canceling
[00:34:19.360 --> 00:34:24.880]   that it wouldn't have but maybe your tip is nice yeah so maybe that's what what we're going to
[00:34:24.880 --> 00:34:31.200]   possibly see in the future is air tips for the air pods that seems to make sense without calling
[00:34:31.200 --> 00:34:36.160]   it pro light which just you know that just doesn't make any sense to me i think digit times today
[00:34:36.160 --> 00:34:40.880]   said the 12 inch ipad pro now everyone's wondering is that a new one or the 12.9 inch digit times
[00:34:40.880 --> 00:34:45.440]   not know how to type or are they leaking a new device and we don't know no clue nobody i still
[00:34:45.440 --> 00:34:51.040]   can't tell so we don't know what the impact to get back to the original story of covid-19 will be
[00:34:51.040 --> 00:34:56.400]   in the long run but it might slow some things down it might kind of hurt this year revenue
[00:34:56.400 --> 00:35:01.200]   uh i guess slow the world down but if it gets out of china i mean it's the whole thing can
[00:35:01.200 --> 00:35:05.760]   this is that's the thing it's a big unknown well already slowing things down that even like uh
[00:35:05.760 --> 00:35:10.240]   even garment manufacturers outside of china well they're getting their zippers from china and so
[00:35:10.240 --> 00:35:14.560]   they don't know when they can meet their their their their manufacturing goals so it really has
[00:35:14.560 --> 00:35:20.160]   decided how dependent we all are on china well we're going to say like one of those
[00:35:20.160 --> 00:35:23.440]   one of those articles we're saying like oh look how depending on china and i just have to keep
[00:35:23.440 --> 00:35:27.280]   reminding them if anything happens in silicon valley it's not going to be funny either i mean
[00:35:27.280 --> 00:35:31.440]   like of aliens land in silicon valley we're gonna have a really bad year so maybe it's not
[00:35:31.440 --> 00:35:35.440]   independent in this modern world we're all interdependent on one another the real question
[00:35:35.440 --> 00:35:40.560]   over the next two to four years is or or five to ten years is whether china can now maintain being
[00:35:40.560 --> 00:35:45.200]   the supplier for everyone after this after between the trade war this will stimulate this there's
[00:35:45.200 --> 00:35:48.720]   this kind of look at a lot of people are going to be thinking about like where you know where else
[00:35:48.720 --> 00:35:54.480]   can we build factories and india brazil uh you know there's you're already there in both cases
[00:35:54.480 --> 00:35:59.600]   because of tariffs in those two countries right or restrictions on what can be sold that isn't
[00:35:59.600 --> 00:36:04.720]   named borgeria borgeria i think borgeria but there's one there's one thing that we're there's
[00:36:04.720 --> 00:36:10.240]   one component that we're missing out on that it's not that it's not the factories and it's not the
[00:36:10.240 --> 00:36:16.640]   supply it's the labor every single business is dependent upon labor and yet this is the resource
[00:36:16.640 --> 00:36:22.160]   that particular the united states we are treating the most poorly so if you want to see armageddon
[00:36:22.160 --> 00:36:27.120]   coming in the future find out a situation which you can that you cannot find people to do the
[00:36:27.120 --> 00:36:32.800]   work that you need them to do well i i think that that number one is yet you can definitely and as
[00:36:32.800 --> 00:36:37.680]   computers and as machines continue to augment the human labor i think you're gonna actually be
[00:36:37.680 --> 00:36:41.600]   able to pay the labor more and and put it in different places because you're gonna have
[00:36:41.600 --> 00:36:46.240]   you know right now it's just so many people that are required to do stuff by hand and and that's
[00:36:46.240 --> 00:36:51.760]   you know typically going to um continue to move you know along but there's plenty of places in the
[00:36:51.760 --> 00:36:58.480]   world that can still be built i mean affordly rene phillen phillas in on the blue mail story
[00:36:58.480 --> 00:37:08.400]   apple banned blue mail and as now brought it back what is blue mail um actually i have not been
[00:37:08.400 --> 00:37:12.800]   followed okay yeah i only followed this remotely but yeah it was another case of them saying that apple
[00:37:12.800 --> 00:37:17.520]   was stomping on their rights to individual apps for their own benefit and apple saying that no this
[00:37:17.520 --> 00:37:22.880]   app introduced valid concerns into the into the system and then everyone losing it over it apple
[00:37:22.880 --> 00:37:32.000]   it okay blue mail says it apple stole its anonymous sign-in feature yeah for signing with apple we
[00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:38.240]   created it apple made it sign-in with apple and then blue mail says they kicked it out of the app store
[00:37:38.240 --> 00:37:46.080]   on flimsy pretenses to suppress competition apple says no we removed it for security reasons but now
[00:37:46.080 --> 00:37:52.960]   blue mail is back in the app store uh blicks the publisher had published an open letter
[00:37:52.960 --> 00:38:00.880]   urging small developers to join forces and fight apple um so yeah this is a this is one where we're
[00:38:00.880 --> 00:38:04.960]   only looking from the outside and it's hard to know there's two problems with this is like with the
[00:38:04.960 --> 00:38:08.800]   app store there's a problem with apple abusing it and being wrong but there's also a problem with
[00:38:08.800 --> 00:38:13.200]   apple being right and not and it being inconvenient to be right because it looks like abuse it looks
[00:38:13.200 --> 00:38:17.840]   like they're being a bully and both of those things are damaging i don't use blue mail so i i don't
[00:38:17.840 --> 00:38:22.800]   have any experience blick's suit apple for patent infringement over sign-in with apple
[00:38:22.800 --> 00:38:28.560]   and the company says we're not going to drop that suit on the other hand blick's did submit a new
[00:38:28.560 --> 00:38:34.640]   version of blue mail that respected gatekeeper well that seems like a good thing yeah a little bit
[00:38:34.640 --> 00:38:39.680]   fixed to technical problems including an issue that produced privacy and security warnings for
[00:38:39.680 --> 00:38:44.480]   users at launch you might not want to use an app where you get that kind of warning especially mail
[00:38:44.480 --> 00:38:52.160]   yeah um but anyway so okay so yeah we don't know what's really going on i just i was hoping yeah
[00:38:52.160 --> 00:38:56.400]   somebody would put part of part of the problem is that even in the discussions between apple and
[00:38:56.400 --> 00:39:00.560]   a developer apple will not be transparent on the reasons why they removed you from the store that
[00:39:00.560 --> 00:39:05.920]   will just simply say we you violated you violated this this part of the terms and then they will
[00:39:05.920 --> 00:39:10.080]   come the developer will come back saying actually no we didn't you told us exactly what to do and we
[00:39:10.080 --> 00:39:14.240]   did what you did we did exactly as you asked and then that's another month or two in which you're
[00:39:14.240 --> 00:39:18.320]   trying to figure out exactly what's going on and that's a real once you're frustrated to that point
[00:39:18.320 --> 00:39:22.240]   it's a good time to start calling calling people and saying hey apple is locking us out of the
[00:39:22.240 --> 00:39:27.360]   app store we don't know why maybe it's because they're they're they don't like our they don't like
[00:39:27.360 --> 00:39:32.960]   our giving people an alternative solution to the generator generator random email address that

[00:43:57.120 --> 00:44:03.600]   about that i guess but none of people maybe Purina wants to buy some kitty chat ads i i do those
[00:44:03.600 --> 00:44:08.960]   um anyway we appreciate you're taking it you can go to twit.tv our website there's a link at the top
[00:44:08.960 --> 00:44:17.040]   there but just for a couple more days or the short URL which is twit.to/survey20 or 2020 survey
[00:44:17.040 --> 00:44:24.800]   about to close but we want to get your input so please do that today. I wonder if you all read
[00:44:24.800 --> 00:44:31.360]   this article it came out a couple of days ago the pay walled garden ios is adware steve strasad
[00:44:31.360 --> 00:44:38.160]   now that's a little bit of a link bait ad title but he does make an excellent point he says you
[00:44:38.160 --> 00:44:42.880]   and i most of the people listen to the show we all sign up for apple music and i cloud services
[00:44:42.880 --> 00:44:49.200]   and extended war tees etcetera news plus arcade but those who don't and he said you can find that
[00:44:49.200 --> 00:44:54.000]   you can learn this for yourself if you install ios 13 create a new i cloud account and don't sign
[00:44:54.000 --> 00:45:00.880]   up for apple services are bombarded bombarded with pitches and i have to say i kind of i've seen
[00:45:00.880 --> 00:45:10.560]   somebody bad even in violation of apples own standards for other third party apps you agree
[00:45:10.560 --> 00:45:15.920]   rene yeah so i i think there's two there's apple traditionally has had a bit of a war going on
[00:45:15.920 --> 00:45:20.880]   internally where they had like the user experience people who were adamant that you would not so much
[00:45:20.880 --> 00:45:25.360]   as send a push notification and the business people who are like okay dinosaur you know the
[00:45:25.360 --> 00:45:29.120]   company has to survive beyond you and the minute they went on vacation they would send those push
[00:45:29.120 --> 00:45:33.360]   notifications um and those are still those are still fighting back on the back of the app we have
[00:45:33.360 --> 00:45:39.520]   that battle at twit because most of my staff wants us to run more promos for the other shows and i say
[00:45:39.520 --> 00:45:45.600]   no yeah i don't want to run promos for the other shows even though they're my shows i just i feel
[00:45:45.600 --> 00:45:50.400]   like we're doing a thing here i don't want to but yeah no so totally and some people feel like like
[00:45:50.400 --> 00:45:53.600]   it's not just leaving money on the table but you're fundamentally threatening the the ongoing
[00:45:53.600 --> 00:45:57.680]   future of the business but not actively promoting it but then also there's this other level of
[00:45:57.680 --> 00:46:03.520]   counseling every night when we go to bed you're threatening the business there's this other thing
[00:46:03.520 --> 00:46:07.840]   though too is where like discoverability because there are like there are people who literally don't
[00:46:07.840 --> 00:46:13.120]   know how to get apple care or don't know how to find something and ios is because like any modern
[00:46:13.120 --> 00:46:18.000]   phone system is not that a transparent to an end user so you want to have some element of
[00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:22.320]   discovery but you don't want to annoy people you want to have some ability to make money but you
[00:46:22.320 --> 00:46:26.320]   don't want to destroy the experience and i think apple has gone they were they were maybe too minimal
[00:46:26.320 --> 00:46:31.120]   before and now they're way too maximal and they really need to find a way they're balancing between
[00:46:31.120 --> 00:46:35.360]   he says it doesn't get that much coverage because people like us we're all signed in we're all in
[00:46:35.360 --> 00:46:41.120]   anyway on the apple ecosystem so we don't see those ads um but it's a little thing just like i i
[00:46:41.120 --> 00:46:45.040]   there's it turns out there's a limit to how many devices you can have on apple pay and i found
[00:46:45.040 --> 00:46:49.520]   that limit because i just kept activating review devices and it just it said no no and so now on
[00:46:49.520 --> 00:46:53.920]   a bunch of phones i have that you're seeing you didn't finish setting up right you're in that i
[00:46:53.920 --> 00:46:58.560]   that i i try to make that and i'm like i if i see a notification if i see a number on something i
[00:46:58.560 --> 00:47:03.760]   keep tapping it i can't not tap it and it just it won't go away and it kills me and i feel the pain
[00:47:03.760 --> 00:47:08.800]   that he's talking about so severely there he says apple has a rule for other developers push
[00:47:08.800 --> 00:47:15.680]   notifications must not be required for the app to function and should not be used for advertising
[00:47:15.680 --> 00:47:20.480]   promotions or direct marketing marketing purposes or to send per sensitive personal or
[00:47:20.480 --> 00:47:25.760]   confidential information obviously apple is using it for promotions and advertising and direct marketing
[00:47:25.760 --> 00:47:30.720]   it's their platform uh you know so i can see you know they kind of have a right to do it when they
[00:47:30.720 --> 00:47:34.800]   and they have a right to say others can't any of them turn off you can turn off right turn off
[00:47:34.800 --> 00:47:41.120]   notification not really some of them like the notifications about like i i i wish there were a
[00:47:41.120 --> 00:47:46.560]   button that says hell no katalina but unless you but unless you take actions to have it stopped
[00:47:46.560 --> 00:47:52.320]   stop putting up a a pip inside software up to say oh you have updates available did you know that
[00:47:52.320 --> 00:47:58.000]   katalina has a wonderful plan for your life it's yeah well here's an example that you go up most
[00:47:58.000 --> 00:48:02.160]   people when they put if they put music on their phone if they synced it up or whatever put music
[00:48:02.160 --> 00:48:08.320]   on their phone would use apple's music app to play the music but it really isn't apple's music player
[00:48:08.320 --> 00:48:15.680]   app it's apple music and so as you're listening you know you're gonna get for instance try the all
[00:48:15.680 --> 00:48:21.040]   new experience lyrics experience he says well that looks like just a feature right i'm gonna click
[00:48:21.040 --> 00:48:26.480]   get started and then of course but first you have to sign up for apples music and and so there's a
[00:48:26.480 --> 00:48:32.000]   lot of that now i don't use apples music player to play music there are third party choices
[00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:37.200]   but that's but everybody probably just says well it says music that must be the music player right
[00:48:37.200 --> 00:48:42.240]   so i understand that's a that's a little bit of criticism i mean absolutely
[00:48:42.240 --> 00:48:49.760]   i'm sorry go ahead laurie if it were just a couple of times a month you might see an ad pop up in
[00:48:49.760 --> 00:48:55.280]   the music app or on the news app or something like that it would it would be an okay you know it's a
[00:48:55.280 --> 00:49:02.800]   little bit of of a reminder but i when i when i sign out i see it everywhere it's i'm constantly
[00:49:02.800 --> 00:49:08.160]   reminded of these services that i'm not signed into or if i hadn't subscribed not subscribed to
[00:49:08.160 --> 00:49:13.760]   it's everywhere it permeates these services that they have i don't know if they have plans
[00:49:13.760 --> 00:49:18.320]   once these things have kind of taken off of maybe they'll pull back on how much they advertise but
[00:49:18.320 --> 00:49:24.720]   it really is kind of frustrating to be somebody who doesn't the the news app is where i see it a
[00:49:24.720 --> 00:49:31.120]   lot i i do pay for news plus but i would say if i'm not signed in some apple id for some reason
[00:49:31.120 --> 00:49:37.280]   i'll just start scrolling through the news app and every three or four sections there's another ad
[00:49:37.280 --> 00:49:42.960]   for for news plus right get news plus get news plus get news plus it happens all over the place on
[00:49:42.960 --> 00:49:47.360]   that page i think part of it is that you're obviously a big when big part of your business is
[00:49:47.360 --> 00:49:51.840]   subscribed they want to you know it annoys you to be in your model well they made a model for
[00:49:51.840 --> 00:49:56.240]   like they said yeah they said they're gonna make massive amounts of subscription and revenue and
[00:49:56.240 --> 00:50:00.320]   they'll take a few more to do it but that's app store which makes it hard for them to crack down
[00:50:00.320 --> 00:50:05.120]   on scam ads that's google search revenue which makes it hard for them to push dot dot go and
[00:50:05.120 --> 00:50:08.480]   that subscription just makes it hard for them to offer a better user experience at the expense
[00:50:08.480 --> 00:50:12.720]   of pushing subscriptions right sorry that's why i think that good uh no that's okay that's why i
[00:50:12.720 --> 00:50:18.480]   think that part of good user interface is to have not just a no button or dismiss button but a hell
[00:50:18.480 --> 00:50:23.280]   no button you can call it something more polite but basically say that yes i have seen this i have
[00:50:23.280 --> 00:50:28.640]   seen this this alert i have considered it but i not i don't want this i don't want you to ever remind
[00:50:28.640 --> 00:50:33.760]   me about this ever again and so i don't uh there are a lot of really good arguments for why apple
[00:50:33.760 --> 00:50:40.160]   has a certain right to put out these push notifications part of which being that it is so easy for them
[00:50:40.160 --> 00:50:45.040]   to get rid of them once they once they decide that they want to remove them as a blight on the earth
[00:50:45.040 --> 00:50:49.280]   which is a harder problem when you went to third party app but i really think that if they really
[00:50:49.280 --> 00:50:54.080]   did think that this was a problem and they really did want to solve it they could say no and don't
[00:50:54.080 --> 00:50:58.800]   remind me ever again i agree i think that would be the right the right thing to do the app cell is a
[00:50:58.800 --> 00:51:03.520]   long standing american tradition when i was in high school i worked at mcdonald's you were taught at
[00:51:03.520 --> 00:51:07.680]   every order at the end of the order would you like fries with that or how would you like a nice hot
[00:51:07.680 --> 00:51:14.080]   apple pie what would you like to eat with your side that's normal and i suppose it's you know
[00:51:14.080 --> 00:51:19.280]   tolerable to the customer they're gonna hear it they're gonna say no thanks but uh the tolerance
[00:51:19.280 --> 00:51:23.680]   is different though like when i bought a panasonic like i bought a panasonic blu-ray player and it
[00:51:23.680 --> 00:51:28.800]   starts playing pre-roll before the the blu-ray that i put in i took it back like i didn't get a free
[00:51:28.800 --> 00:51:34.080]   blu-ray player that i had to put up with ads i bought one and and now even like amazon prime
[00:51:34.080 --> 00:51:39.760]   they do pre-roll now and i'm like no i subscribe i paid you like don't i don't put that pre-roll there
[00:51:39.760 --> 00:51:44.480]   and i think like some people and it makes people anti-ad which is bad for everybody because like
[00:51:44.480 --> 00:51:48.640]   like podcasts depend on ads and people start thinking ads are evil instead of just bad
[00:51:48.640 --> 00:51:54.000]   implementations that's thank you for saying that that's really true i i i will say that if i pay
[00:51:54.000 --> 00:51:58.720]   once i pay for a service i expect to never see an ad like like you know and i know that we pay
[00:51:58.720 --> 00:52:04.320]   papers and magazines and you didn't pay for the service and you're using apple music you have to
[00:52:04.320 --> 00:52:08.400]   admit i'd be kind of like oh that's what i get it's just another ad you know and well like for me the
[00:52:08.400 --> 00:52:13.200]   the big challenge is like i i don't use any of the youtube any of the google ads sensor any of the
[00:52:13.200 --> 00:52:17.440]   youtube ads i use sponsorships and the people who pay for youtube premium get super upset because
[00:52:17.440 --> 00:52:21.280]   they still see a sponsorship my thing and i have to point out i'm actually not using any of google
[00:52:21.280 --> 00:52:26.080]   stuff yeah right hey i i know that i should have asked you this when we were talking about blue
[00:52:26.080 --> 00:52:32.000]   mail do you see a lot of sign in with iphone yet i started starting to i thought that was not as
[00:52:32.000 --> 00:52:36.720]   many as we i would have thought everybody would have done this right they delayed a lot uh apple
[00:52:36.720 --> 00:52:40.000]   stock delayed enforcement of it because there were a lot of edge cases like for example gmail
[00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:45.120]   shouldn't have to offer you face facebook login or login with apple they can just offer you google
[00:52:45.120 --> 00:52:48.800]   and there was a handful of things they had to change and guidelines that they ran into and
[00:52:48.800 --> 00:52:53.360]   developers started implementing it so february was when i they started coming out and i expect we'll
[00:52:53.360 --> 00:52:57.920]   see more as the year progressed i i like it i always use it if i have it as a choice i think
[00:52:57.920 --> 00:53:04.960]   it's a good way to do it as a as um somebody who tests out programs and apps like early like
[00:53:04.960 --> 00:53:10.160]   usually in beta it's been a frustrating experience for me because i'll have to sign up before sign
[00:53:10.160 --> 00:53:15.680]   in with apple becomes available so i've already signed in yeah you know with my gmail account
[00:53:15.680 --> 00:53:20.640]   or whatever and then like oh they have signed in with apple and i couldn't use it oh no well it's
[00:53:20.640 --> 00:53:27.760]   also a frustration because i i signed i was stupid in my ute and signed in with facebook a lot
[00:53:27.760 --> 00:53:32.880]   and then i killed my facebook account and i i suddenly realized oh my god i can't i can't get
[00:53:32.880 --> 00:53:40.080]   into any of those apps anymore right so there can be there can be uh yeah negatives but i don't
[00:53:40.080 --> 00:53:43.440]   think that's gonna happen with apple i think i'll probably always have an apple device of some kind
[00:53:43.440 --> 00:53:48.320]   i i definitely think it is it is another example of how apple it has to walk a really really sensitive
[00:53:48.320 --> 00:53:53.280]   line here where having signed in by apple is so good for consumers because the biometric sign in
[00:53:53.280 --> 00:53:58.240]   that that's on so many apple devices is so easy and it works very very very well yeah but none
[00:53:58.240 --> 00:54:03.200]   the but nonetheless when they make it a requirement for all developers that you have to support this
[00:54:03.200 --> 00:54:08.080]   standard that we apple are trying to promote and which is going to help push sales of our own devices
[00:54:08.080 --> 00:54:15.840]   by uh by upsurging adoption of uh of our hardware not only uh to our existing base but also to consume
[00:54:15.840 --> 00:54:21.040]   excuse me to also to sellers also to point and sell you have to their their motives can be
[00:54:21.040 --> 00:54:26.320]   absolutely pure but they have to pursue this in such a way so that even caesar's wife is beyond
[00:54:26.320 --> 00:54:30.080]   reproach so to speak i think the problem the developers have is that consumers want it so badly
[00:54:30.080 --> 00:54:33.840]   that that they don't really care what they think you know like the consumers are you know like
[00:54:33.840 --> 00:54:39.040]   they're gonna be it's gonna get to a point within two years where i won't sign into anything that
[00:54:39.040 --> 00:54:43.520]   doesn't give me that but the privacy you know like like i'm just gonna be like yeah what i don't
[00:54:43.520 --> 00:54:45.520]   think you should be able to make a difference in the
[00:54:45.520 --> 00:54:50.160]   security you do sign in with apple shouldn't the place also say now give us a password too in case
[00:54:50.160 --> 00:54:54.800]   this you're doing it like say i sign in with apple well for something that i now use on a
[00:54:54.800 --> 00:55:00.080]   windows machine or an android device i would like a password you can i'm sure that you'll be able to
[00:55:00.080 --> 00:55:04.800]   get that but i think you should always offer but those are so those are yeah so they you should
[00:55:04.800 --> 00:55:08.400]   have that like the the service should offer a password but the whole point of like signing with
[00:55:08.400 --> 00:55:12.720]   apple is the one no password i like the one yeah then no password thing yeah but the service as i
[00:55:12.720 --> 00:55:18.400]   learned to my horror that if you do a sign in with facebook and you quit your facebook account
[00:55:18.400 --> 00:55:23.200]   there's no second channel there's no other way to do it we had to do it for a bunch of
[00:55:23.200 --> 00:55:27.120]   pokemon go accounts because people would be when we were bought by future all the mobile
[00:55:27.120 --> 00:55:30.640]   nations accounts were going away they were all getting future accounts signed up with
[00:55:30.640 --> 00:55:35.520]   signed up so you have to like you you have to like go to use it like log in by facebook
[00:55:35.520 --> 00:55:39.520]   and then add a different google account and then get rid of the login by and i didn't have a facebook
[00:55:39.520 --> 00:55:44.880]   account what a pain did you have to call like an all staff have like one of those facebook
[00:55:44.880 --> 00:55:49.280]   style everybody into the break room so we have to we have to discuss now in your venture a lot of
[00:55:49.280 --> 00:55:54.960]   rumors about your access to poke to pokemon go as effective but some people it wasn't pokemon go
[00:55:54.960 --> 00:55:59.600]   like it was 401k we don't care about people getting fired the second position mean we won't be able
[00:55:59.600 --> 00:56:04.400]   to access pokemon go you have a very cool corporate for some people it wasn't pokemon go like it was
[00:56:04.400 --> 00:56:08.080]   just we we write a lot about it so that was one of the biggest outliers but for everybody it was
[00:56:08.080 --> 00:56:12.880]   like a couple of apps that they'd only ever signed into from their work google account and that was
[00:56:12.880 --> 00:56:18.400]   going away and what are you going to do and luckily quote unquote luckily you could add a facebook
[00:56:18.400 --> 00:56:22.320]   account remove the old google account add a new google account but some services don't have that
[00:56:22.320 --> 00:56:25.920]   it's just like you know sorry and they won't change it for you you can beg and plead all you want they
[00:56:25.920 --> 00:56:32.080]   won't do anything for you so it is a huge dependency yeah so i got a little irate with malware bites
[00:56:33.200 --> 00:56:39.760]   i wonder yeah you too yeah now we're by pretty weird yeah they're an antivirus company
[00:56:39.760 --> 00:56:48.160]   so as soon as an antivirus company says oh it's a big problem by our via antivirus it's a little
[00:56:48.160 --> 00:56:55.040]   sketch but they release every year their state of malware report and this year they said malware
[00:56:55.040 --> 00:57:02.400]   the big takeaway was malware threats on the mac increased exponentially and in fact
[00:57:02.400 --> 00:57:11.760]   mac's outpace windows in threats per end point that's the metric they're using by two to one
[00:57:11.760 --> 00:57:19.760]   in other words according to malware bites you're twice as likely to have malware on your end point
[00:57:19.760 --> 00:57:27.680]   if you're using a mac is that true what what i know right it's not my experience yeah
[00:57:27.680 --> 00:57:32.880]   yeah it's well i mean they're conflating a lot of things as malware in those articles and they're
[00:57:32.880 --> 00:57:37.280]   also using a very like they're using a very specific period of time and apple has mitigated some of
[00:57:37.280 --> 00:57:41.280]   the stuff was adware and apple has added mitigations for those things jason snell wrote a wonderful
[00:57:41.280 --> 00:57:45.840]   article almost all of it was adware i should say yes by the way yes and also like you know like
[00:57:45.840 --> 00:57:49.920]   are they counting things where you go to a website and it downloads an exe file because that happens
[00:57:49.920 --> 00:57:54.720]   to me right like is that considered harmless i think they are i think they are counting it but
[00:57:54.720 --> 00:57:58.880]   i don't think they're counting it yeah because it doesn't infect you because it's an exe yeah
[00:57:58.880 --> 00:58:04.960]   um yeah i mean honestly it almost feels like somebody in the corporate offices at malware
[00:58:04.960 --> 00:58:09.680]   bites said we need to sell more malware bites to mac users what can you do to help us here
[00:58:09.680 --> 00:58:14.880]   yeah i think that the jason snell's article is very very good at one of the reasons why
[00:58:15.440 --> 00:58:20.400]   and also afterwards i got a certification that was very very good that malware bites is upset
[00:58:20.400 --> 00:58:24.720]   with jason and jason is fighting back because jason is good and jason is jason
[00:58:24.720 --> 00:58:31.680]   oh good well let's uh um let's let's they're they're having a legit twitter beef like let's uh let's
[00:58:31.680 --> 00:58:38.960]   uh let's put six colors dot com jason's article sleazy adware targets mac users and apple steps up
[00:58:38.960 --> 00:58:45.040]   as game is this the article this is the malware bites report um he says the key here is the
[00:58:45.040 --> 00:58:53.840]   differentiweight between adware pops potentially unwanted programs and malware the top 29 bad actors
[00:58:53.840 --> 00:59:01.920]   tracked by malware bites were adware pops not malware i still think your mac is much more secure
[00:59:01.920 --> 00:59:07.120]   than any windows machine that's that's just kind of yeah that's and i think that's the takeaway
[00:59:07.120 --> 00:59:13.040]   people get from this report is oh my god and of course the report recommends what do they recommend
[00:59:13.040 --> 00:59:19.040]   install malware bites which i do not recommend does anybody here on this panel would any of you
[00:59:19.040 --> 00:59:25.280]   say yeah you should have malware bites in your mac no no okay here's so you have a specific problem
[00:59:25.280 --> 00:59:30.240]   and infection maybe as a tool to remove it but best practices and it's the same best practice as
[00:59:30.240 --> 00:59:35.440]   pc or mac like just best practices will save you most of the most of any form of headache on a mac
[00:59:35.440 --> 00:59:39.760]   and i feel like i mean certainly on windows 10 i'm telling people you no longer need to install
[00:59:39.760 --> 00:59:44.560]   uh antivirus software because windows 10 has antivirus software yeah that is good anything you're
[00:59:44.560 --> 00:59:48.400]   gonna install and is not gonna slow down your machine and is not in his sandbox so it's not
[00:59:48.400 --> 00:59:52.160]   gonna open holes on your machine some of it is as bad as malware like some of the anti-malware
[00:59:52.160 --> 00:59:58.880]   is as bad as malware yeah uh on the mac i think between gatekeeper which is an excellent technology
[00:59:58.880 --> 01:00:04.000]   and the kind of hidden stuff apple's doing behind the scenes to scrub malware i feel like you're
[01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:10.080]   pretty well protected there isn't a antivirus per se on a mac and tush to with anti-malware
[01:00:10.080 --> 01:00:14.480]   there there is an anti-malware layer that intercepts and quarantines a lot of programs so it doesn't
[01:00:14.480 --> 01:00:18.880]   it doesn't announce itself they don't talk about it but the the update it cont continuously and it's
[01:00:18.880 --> 01:00:22.880]   always running in the background of of every of the last three i think generations of more
[01:00:22.880 --> 01:00:28.640]   important than defending apple here should somebody now be scared because of this malware
[01:00:28.640 --> 01:00:33.920]   bites report is is this something to worry about are we really now bigger target than we used to
[01:00:33.920 --> 01:00:39.680]   be absolutely not there's the the thing is we have not seen any sort of an increase in
[01:00:39.680 --> 01:00:45.840]   and anything kind of anything that we're going out to infections anything that amount to hijacking
[01:00:45.840 --> 01:00:52.240]   anything would even amount to inconvenience this is a large it's it would be absolutely 100
[01:00:52.240 --> 01:00:56.880]   wrong for someone to think that mac simply don't get malware and they don't get infected
[01:00:56.880 --> 01:01:03.200]   because for instance a targeted a targeted approach is still uh by mac is still pretty nearly as
[01:01:03.200 --> 01:01:08.400]   vulnerable as any other platform out there so if someone specifically wants to get at the data on
[01:01:08.400 --> 01:01:14.160]   your machine uh and because you're a very valid valuable target someone could probably be able
[01:01:14.160 --> 01:01:22.400]   to do that but in terms of thinking that is like when does the mac universe uh not not that i
[01:01:22.400 --> 01:01:27.520]   none that i've seen and it's really mostly affecting the reason why it's mostly affecting
[01:01:27.520 --> 01:01:32.640]   a government systems and big big corporate systems because a lot of them can't afford or
[01:01:32.640 --> 01:01:37.760]   this can't afford in terms of money or in terms of downtime to upgrade weaker and older versions
[01:01:37.760 --> 01:01:44.800]   of windows it's their infections on modern machines are very very low it's mostly if you have a huge
[01:01:44.800 --> 01:01:50.240]   huge network of legacy devices the number of county computers there's still uh they're still
[01:01:50.240 --> 01:01:55.680]   running on uh eight-year-old versions of windows is very very high i've not i've not heard of a
[01:01:55.680 --> 01:02:00.640]   ransom wear attack that worked on a mac platform or even a modern platform i think almost all the
[01:02:00.640 --> 01:02:04.720]   ransomware have been older yeah machines that are having been updated in an interview with
[01:02:04.720 --> 01:02:11.520]   recode malware bites mac expert thomas read being quoted here by jason snell there's a rising tide
[01:02:11.520 --> 01:02:18.400]   of mac threats hitting a population that still believes that macs don't get viruses i still frequently
[01:02:18.400 --> 01:02:23.200]   encounter people who firmly believe this and who believe that using any kind of security software
[01:02:23.200 --> 01:02:30.480]   is not necessary or even harmful this makes mac os a fertile ground for the influx of new threats
[01:02:30.480 --> 01:02:36.080]   yeah whereas it's a common knowledge of windows pcs need security software wrong on both counts
[01:02:36.080 --> 01:02:41.520]   just self-serving i wish i could do a word that the president does not that's not a really great
[01:02:41.520 --> 01:02:46.880]   way to defend yourself against the claim that you're a stoking fear yeah uh and it takes a
[01:02:46.880 --> 01:02:53.520]   thing yes yeah it's it's like when it's like when they said uh a lot with windows and with macs
[01:02:53.520 --> 01:02:58.320]   though your antivirus protection your malware protection is baked right in uh the most effective
[01:02:58.320 --> 01:03:03.040]   versions of the kinds that you don't know necessarily know are even working and uh there's uh i don't
[01:03:03.040 --> 01:03:08.640]   know if you if you checked uh jason's twitter uh he's th thomas re basically said the same thing
[01:03:08.640 --> 01:03:12.880]   to jason's thing i take exception to some of the tone of this article especially its characterization
[01:03:12.880 --> 01:03:18.240]   of me as quote stoking fear unquote and the statement macs don't get viruses is a statement that's still
[01:03:18.240 --> 01:03:22.560]   overwhelmingly true i see so many people getting infected because they believe this and jason
[01:03:22.560 --> 01:03:26.400]   saying well as i wrote it's valid to wonder if the macs reputation for being a safe harbor
[01:03:26.400 --> 01:03:31.120]   leads some mac users to make bad security choices that said i do think you and your employer are
[01:03:31.120 --> 01:03:37.040]   stoking fear and that malware bites benefits from that fear i'm not surprised you take exception
[01:03:37.040 --> 01:03:44.160]   so yes thank you jason bravo you should get jason on the show i haven't seen jason in a while i
[01:03:44.160 --> 01:03:50.320]   miss yes uh the mac does not have let's say it right now the mac does not have more malware
[01:03:50.880 --> 01:03:57.920]   than windows uh there are minor adware and you know hijackers and things uh that aren't
[01:03:57.920 --> 01:04:02.480]   malware like it being targeted is one thing but what we for think of as widespread malware is just
[01:04:02.480 --> 01:04:08.480]   not happening and and yeah good hygiene is still a good idea you know like i yeah mostly it's
[01:04:08.480 --> 01:04:12.880]   behavioral though yeah yeah i mean it's it's stuff you know like what when people send me i have
[01:04:12.880 --> 01:04:17.120]   two men i push back when people send me uh and mostly from my kid's school you'll get someone
[01:04:17.120 --> 01:04:23.360]   send an email where they just did two to four hundred people you know like you know and and
[01:04:23.360 --> 01:04:28.000]   oh you get the nice little email back like i know you're really busy but yeah blind cc is a good thing
[01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:31.840]   you know like like you know it's it's it keeps us all out because otherwise you don't know where
[01:04:31.840 --> 01:04:38.720]   that email is coming from once someone's been um uh pushed you know pushed over then then they
[01:04:38.720 --> 01:04:42.400]   you know their entire email list is now you could get something that looks like it's coming from
[01:04:42.400 --> 01:04:47.760]   someone you know and it's not and so you know but but good but good hygiene and and uh you know
[01:04:47.760 --> 01:04:55.040]   uh is is a useful thing yeah all right i just i i read that and my you know it's funny because
[01:04:55.040 --> 01:05:02.560]   there's the lizard mine which goes and then there's and then there's the tech guy you know i talk to
[01:05:02.560 --> 01:05:08.960]   people on the radio and i'm always re-evaluating my uh long held belief that you shouldn't run
[01:05:08.960 --> 01:05:14.080]   antivirus software on either windows 10 or mac and tush you're well protected by the operating
[01:05:14.080 --> 01:05:19.360]   system itself and so i just want to run that by you one more time i ask for steve gibson our
[01:05:19.360 --> 01:05:24.960]   security guy ask him this every month should i run a virus now no do you run a virus steve no
[01:05:24.960 --> 01:05:31.680]   okay just checking oh also by definition an antivirus app has to have pretty high
[01:05:31.680 --> 01:05:36.000]   permissions in order to be able to observe everything's going on inside the cpu right so that that
[01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:40.960]   is something that is best left to the the operating system itself yeah and thank goodness uh you know
[01:05:40.960 --> 01:05:44.560]   both apple and microsoft microsoft late to the game but both apple microsoft take that
[01:05:44.560 --> 01:05:50.080]   responsibility seriously and do in fact attempt and i think mostly successfully to protect you
[01:05:50.080 --> 01:05:56.080]   um on now having said that i will defend malware bytes there are occasions where it's a useful
[01:05:56.080 --> 01:06:01.600]   tool uh i would what i would do is download it run it and and then delete it yeah uh and so there
[01:06:01.600 --> 01:06:06.160]   are cases both the windows and mac with that's useful to get rid of kind of annoyances like
[01:06:06.160 --> 01:06:10.320]   adware and there's other ones like dinder antivirus yeah i don't know if those are
[01:06:10.320 --> 01:06:14.960]   i'd be really careful though the other thing that i also really warn people about on the radio
[01:06:14.960 --> 01:06:20.640]   show remember on the radio show i feel like i'm dealing with normal people um is get it from malware
[01:06:20.640 --> 01:06:27.840]   bites.com am al w-a-r-e-b-y-t-e-s.com they don't make it easy
[01:06:27.840 --> 01:06:35.600]   and and so and it's very and of course every virus author in the world has a variation of that name
[01:06:35.600 --> 01:06:42.080]   ready to go so i i'm also super paranoid like once i get once i believe a machine is compromised i
[01:06:42.080 --> 01:06:45.440]   don't want to run malware bytes or anything on it i want to nuke that thing down to the ad
[01:06:45.440 --> 01:06:49.200]   and rebuild it because i just don't know what i don't know what they might miss what else is
[01:06:49.200 --> 01:06:54.160]   lying in weight there something that's not activated yet i once i can't trust that i can't trust it
[01:06:54.160 --> 01:06:59.920]   and i just want to rebuild it right um now now we should we should say that defraking your hard
[01:06:59.920 --> 01:07:05.120]   drive is still something you should do it with joking what's joking?
[01:07:05.120 --> 01:07:09.520]   e-pram should i e-pram it right now? yeah e-pram it uh talking like have you like you haven't even
[01:07:09.520 --> 01:07:15.120]   rebuilt your desktop recently come on there is uh a dr flainer chairman who is i'm in a constant
[01:07:15.120 --> 01:07:19.120]   running battle with because he's always saying no you have to have any fire software
[01:07:19.120 --> 01:07:24.000]   but he does make an excellent point the best way to protect yourself is to have external
[01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:29.360]   protection as we as most businesses do on the edge in between the internet and your internal
[01:07:29.360 --> 01:07:33.840]   network right because then it's not sitting on your computer it's not going to become malware itself
[01:07:33.840 --> 01:07:40.240]   and uh a lot of home routers now the euro uh our sponsor euro is an example offer that kind of
[01:07:40.240 --> 01:07:45.760]   protection in the home too and i don't see any reason not to have that in fact a lot of people
[01:07:45.760 --> 01:07:51.680]   use gmail which you there's good reason to use gmail because it stops a majority of ransomware
[01:07:51.680 --> 01:07:57.600]   phishing attacks just they don't even come to your inbox and so that kind of protection i think
[01:07:57.600 --> 01:08:02.320]   is good and i i encourage people to use that if that's available to you and vvpn is good if you
[01:08:02.320 --> 01:08:07.840]   can build that into your system right of being able to vpn back home uh that's going to help protect
[01:08:07.840 --> 01:08:12.720]   a lot of things that you're doing when you're using a public Wi-Fi right uh you know one of the
[01:08:12.720 --> 01:08:18.960]   things to do is is set something up uh to allow yourself to have a vpn wherever you are i think the
[01:08:18.960 --> 01:08:27.840]   the thing that i we terrifies me is that we have you know 25 people here of varying skills
[01:08:27.840 --> 01:08:34.960]   in technology you know some of our normal people and uh if any one of them were to open a phishing
[01:08:34.960 --> 01:08:39.920]   email and and get malware on there so then we have a lot of windows systems too get malware on
[01:08:39.920 --> 01:08:45.600]   their systems that could that could take us off the air and cause problems um so i'm always asking
[01:08:45.600 --> 01:08:49.840]   our russell what are we doing about that and he says don't worry we're doing a lot we're protecting
[01:08:49.840 --> 01:08:54.960]   you uh and so we don't have to worry about that and i think training your employees and and
[01:08:54.960 --> 01:08:59.040]   learning yourself if you're going to use a general purpose operating system not an ipad or a chrome
[01:08:59.040 --> 01:09:03.200]   book you do have there's a burden on you to learn a little bit about protecting yourself and what
[01:09:03.200 --> 01:09:09.600]   not to do online right yep don't install that russian wallpaper everybody's talking about
[01:09:09.600 --> 01:09:16.240]   but it looks pretty yeah hey i can't believe you saps are actually paying money for software i found
[01:09:16.240 --> 01:09:22.960]   a a reddit that puts links to don't we can download it for free like oh honey honey oh yeah i think some
[01:09:22.960 --> 01:09:29.280]   of that you know you deserve what you get yeah it's like you know i've there's a there's a bag that
[01:09:29.280 --> 01:09:33.440]   there's a filson bag that i really really want to get and it costs three hundred fifty dollars
[01:09:33.440 --> 01:09:38.480]   and wow amazon amazon has like lots of sellers selling them for two hundred and fifty like
[01:09:38.480 --> 01:09:42.240]   there's a reason why they have this that they haven't for two hundred fifty dollars sweetie
[01:09:42.240 --> 01:09:51.280]   it's because it's not a real bag should also uh admit that there is an up up tech in uptick in
[01:09:51.280 --> 01:09:56.720]   not malware exactly but adware spyware another stuff on the back market become worth it for them
[01:09:56.720 --> 01:10:00.080]   like it's always been an economic crime in the mac market because of like the iphone
[01:10:00.080 --> 01:10:04.320]   hailing everything's become more worth it for them to invest in right more valuable i just have two
[01:10:04.320 --> 01:10:10.880]   words drone strike that was really neat we need to stop messing around with this whole like we're
[01:10:10.880 --> 01:10:14.000]   gonna have a good firewall we're just gonna find out where you're sending it and then we're gonna
[01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:21.600]   send something else to you if you work at an an apple store uh apple employees sued because they
[01:10:21.600 --> 01:10:27.760]   said hey when we uh when we get get to work we have to go through a search and when we leave work
[01:10:27.760 --> 01:10:32.080]   we have to go through a search and apple's not paying us for that california supreme court says
[01:10:32.080 --> 01:10:38.080]   you know what apple has to pay retail employees for the time they spend waiting for bag searches
[01:10:38.080 --> 01:10:43.680]   at the end of a shift yep so and of course they do apple's stance was well you can just leave your
[01:10:43.680 --> 01:10:51.840]   bag at home yeah that's such a it's such an insensitive it's insensitive thing to say
[01:10:51.840 --> 01:10:57.680]   to look oh well just don't bring a bag that just takes zero humanity into consideration what's
[01:10:57.680 --> 01:11:03.120]   over here that has a response apple makes more per employee more per square foot in its apple
[01:11:03.120 --> 01:11:09.360]   stores than even tiffany you could pay a buck or two extra yeah some things you shouldn't go to the
[01:11:09.360 --> 01:11:13.600]   lawyers or let them go like if you don't want to pay them extra let them go half an hour beforehand
[01:11:13.600 --> 01:11:18.720]   and say that that's part of your your work time like either way just say if i can't leave you are
[01:11:18.720 --> 01:11:26.800]   paying me i think i think this is more of a behavioral uh issue so i i've worked in a lot of
[01:11:26.800 --> 01:11:31.280]   secure facilities and so or gone in and out of them i haven't worked at them but i've gone in and out
[01:11:31.280 --> 01:11:35.040]   of a lot of secure facilities nobody has a bag because you know why because the line gets too long
[01:11:35.040 --> 01:11:39.280]   right and and if you go into that if you go in with a bag and they have to go through everybody
[01:11:39.280 --> 01:11:44.720]   behind you has to wait what are you doing you know they look at you like you are crazy you know like
[01:11:44.720 --> 01:11:49.680]   you've just you know better you know and so you get used to the idea that you now i've also packed
[01:11:49.680 --> 01:11:54.080]   really heavy into places that that do that and then people really annoyed with you but but the
[01:11:54.080 --> 01:11:59.520]   but the point is is that is that the there is a behavioral thing here if we're not going to pay
[01:11:59.520 --> 01:12:03.200]   you for it because what we'd like you to do is just not do that and so i have a feeling that that
[01:12:03.200 --> 01:12:07.280]   was more of the it wasn't trying to save money as much as it was trying to have people not
[01:12:07.280 --> 01:12:11.040]   create this big long line of all these people that are bringing stuff in that they don't need
[01:12:11.040 --> 01:12:14.960]   for work you know it's one thing to bring your phone in and check your check it out but like if
[01:12:14.960 --> 01:12:18.640]   if i was getting checked every day on the way in i would bring my phone like that we're talking
[01:12:18.640 --> 01:12:23.280]   Alex we're talking about like retail employees people who sometimes take the bus or something
[01:12:23.280 --> 01:12:27.760]   like that who carry like their change of clothes and their lunch and you know all that kind of stuff
[01:12:27.760 --> 01:12:34.320]   it's you know it's i don't think it's that easy to you know convince me or it's not that easy to
[01:12:34.320 --> 01:12:38.480]   say just don't bring a bag when people's lives are in their bag and they need to bring those
[01:12:38.480 --> 01:12:43.680]   to work because of everything they do getting to that job and then leaving from that job and that's
[01:12:43.680 --> 01:12:48.320]   something you kind of have to think about too is that it's not necessarily that people would just
[01:12:48.320 --> 01:12:53.040]   hop on out to their car to get something that they need that maybe everything that they need is
[01:12:53.040 --> 01:12:58.000]   why they bring that into the to their store yeah that that's a common complaint that's that's
[01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:02.800]   happening across all kinds of different hourly wage industries and like it was like i was saying
[01:13:02.800 --> 01:13:06.480]   for what you can't get your business you can't do your business without labor and if you are
[01:13:06.480 --> 01:13:11.680]   uh don't you don't necessarily have to treat have to pay everybody uh you you hire two hundred
[01:13:11.680 --> 01:13:16.000]   thousand dollars a year and give them full medical but there is certain basic dignity
[01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:20.080]   that is not negotiable particularly when you just announce you have the greatest quarter ever yeah
[01:13:20.080 --> 01:13:26.320]   yeah it's not seemingly and yet i don't think it's money i think it's just going to be real i
[01:13:26.320 --> 01:13:31.120]   i think well i i don't think it's necessarily money or behavior it's like it would never occur to
[01:13:31.120 --> 01:13:35.280]   there's there's a certain level of management not at apple but everywhere where it's like well
[01:13:35.280 --> 01:13:39.600]   why would it would never even occur to them that the ten minutes of someone might spend having to
[01:13:39.600 --> 01:13:44.000]   wait to get their bag check is money that is time they should be paid for they would never
[01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:50.160]   consider that why why would we we they're already checked out why why why would it inconvenience them
[01:13:50.160 --> 01:13:54.560]   at all to have to be paid to not be paid for ten minutes in which they are being forced to do a
[01:13:54.560 --> 01:13:59.840]   bag check that's how labor becomes invisible to management that's that's part of a really huge
[01:13:59.840 --> 01:14:04.720]   problem 45 minutes in some cases according to the court yeah exactly sorry i was minimizing it but
[01:14:04.720 --> 01:14:11.440]   instagram we now know why there's no instagram app on the ipad oh thank god we've cleared this up
[01:14:11.440 --> 01:14:19.040]   adam mccery who's the answer is so simple it's so simple adam mccery who is the ceo current ceo
[01:14:19.040 --> 01:14:27.200]   of instagram um answered a few user questions on his story and of course probably the number one
[01:14:27.200 --> 01:14:33.600]   question is where the hell's the ipad app adam says oh we'd like to build an ipad app but
[01:14:33.600 --> 01:14:39.920]   we only have so many people and lots to do and this just hasn't bubbled up they can't afford to
[01:14:39.920 --> 01:14:44.800]   james what did james tomsen or any of the the lone single developers who do every single platform
[01:14:44.800 --> 01:14:50.800]   in their sleep think about snaz we can't afford their own by facebook what we can't afford to
[01:14:50.800 --> 01:14:55.920]   so i why do you think what's your theory what i mean obviously that's not the reason sure
[01:14:55.920 --> 01:15:00.400]   it's a demand issue like you're you're now you're it's another spoke that you have to support
[01:15:00.400 --> 01:15:03.120]   and how many people are actually going to use their ipad for instagram and they're probably
[01:15:03.120 --> 01:15:09.040]   deciding is probably less than a couple percent and i think they're wrong i would use not necessarily
[01:15:09.040 --> 01:15:14.080]   to create instagram posts but to read instagram posts browsing yeah that's a natural way to do it
[01:15:14.080 --> 01:15:19.840]   there are things you can't do things you can't do an instagram except for through the mobile app
[01:15:19.840 --> 01:15:27.520]   and part of is participating more liberally in likes responses that sort of thing
[01:15:27.520 --> 01:15:31.440]   and it's it's of course of course they don't have a big market for
[01:15:31.440 --> 01:15:35.840]   ipad users because you're not supporting ipad users you you should actually release the app just
[01:15:35.840 --> 01:15:40.720]   on principle and then find out how many people are using your app it the thing the thing that
[01:15:40.720 --> 01:15:45.760]   offends me is that i would be almost okay with this if they said if they if they were if they made
[01:15:45.760 --> 01:15:49.200]   an official statement because there's a lot of questions about oh we have an official statement
[01:15:49.200 --> 01:15:52.560]   on why we don't don't have support the ipad with official ipad app
[01:15:52.560 --> 01:15:59.360]   we don't want to yeah thank you for coming on that's kind of what he's saying in a nice way i guess
[01:15:59.360 --> 01:16:04.480]   and we have other things that's the same thing it's like well we we've gotten such great feedback
[01:16:04.480 --> 01:16:10.400]   over our new keyboards people just seem to love it like yeah okay i got in a lot of trouble on twitter
[01:16:10.400 --> 01:16:14.480]   for saying that i thought it was because they still code with react native and their iphone app keeps
[01:16:14.480 --> 01:16:19.520]   breaking the minute even the same size device comes around and it freezes and they said no
[01:16:19.520 --> 01:16:25.440]   we've got rid of most of our react native so i can't explain the bugs either but i just it's
[01:16:25.440 --> 01:16:30.960]   such a weird thing to say and mark zuckerberg said that a while back if you remember before the ipad
[01:16:30.960 --> 01:16:35.440]   for facebook app came out he just said you know facebook ipad isn't a mobile device so we're not
[01:16:35.440 --> 01:16:43.920]   supporting it which was equally also curious yeah and it but that may be you know that may be more
[01:16:44.640 --> 01:16:50.880]   unintentionally honest because i think the real issue and retcon 500 chat rooms saying this
[01:16:50.880 --> 01:16:56.080]   is that they want you to use it on a smartphone because they can get a lot more information location
[01:16:56.080 --> 01:17:02.800]   and stuff yes from a smartphone they can on the ipad well they they lose care information they lose
[01:17:02.800 --> 01:17:10.480]   some like device identity information but just by wifi and just by wifi and just by proximity
[01:17:10.480 --> 01:17:15.440]   to other things they could get a lot of data i mean it's it's just comes down to you're not
[01:17:15.440 --> 01:17:21.120]   telling me that you cannot afford to create and support an ipad app so don't tell me that it's
[01:17:21.120 --> 01:17:25.520]   because you don't have the money to do this or the or the human power to do this it's actually not
[01:17:25.520 --> 01:17:29.760]   it's actually not as much as cameras on it it's going to be first-class photography it's citizen
[01:17:29.760 --> 01:17:36.240]   yeah it's not as crazy the most of these companies are in a constant shortage of
[01:17:37.360 --> 01:17:42.080]   quality programmers you know we've the world is run out of those you know and and now there's
[01:17:42.080 --> 01:17:45.840]   lots of programmers and that's why but that's why all the kids can code and that's why that's why
[01:17:45.840 --> 01:17:50.960]   that if you have an ios app making an ios app isn't so different but i understand but it's still
[01:17:50.960 --> 01:17:55.360]   somebody that in a company it's still going to be a product manager it's going to be a product
[01:17:55.360 --> 01:18:00.080]   marketing manager it's going to be um you know two or three coordinators it's going to be you know
[01:18:00.080 --> 01:18:04.640]   now four or five programmers and then it's going to be you know it's it's a team of 10 or 15 people in
[01:18:04.640 --> 01:18:09.200]   a side in a company decide it's not one person managing it's just not how it works there you
[01:18:09.200 --> 01:18:14.880]   know so it's going to be 10 or 15 people that are now accountable for the ipad activation and
[01:18:14.880 --> 01:18:18.880]   they have to decide whether they want to take people that are already experienced to do that
[01:18:18.880 --> 01:18:22.400]   you know and and so it's and and they're just making they're just saying it's not it's not a
[01:18:22.400 --> 01:18:27.120]   pro it's not that they don't it's not a priority you know they have many other things again have
[01:18:27.120 --> 01:18:32.160]   to fight these teams have to fight every day for every programmer they have there are four
[01:18:32.160 --> 01:18:42.000]   you know like the instagram scourries which is awkward on it four hundred and i i bet you that
[01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:48.400]   that they need 600 does tiktok have a um does tiktok have an ipad interface no no they've
[01:18:48.400 --> 01:18:56.880]   made a twitter barely has one so maybe there's something about maybe you're right it's react
[01:18:56.880 --> 01:19:00.960]   to me i mean that would be embarrassed to admit that if that were the case i wouldn't say it i
[01:19:00.960 --> 01:19:04.640]   know they said that there's very few mostly just preferences screens now but i think it was just
[01:19:04.640 --> 01:19:08.640]   an awkward reply like if he had just said something like you know we're really focused on the iphone
[01:19:08.640 --> 01:19:12.400]   app experience and we're building out feature sets there there was no win like two seconds
[01:19:12.400 --> 01:19:17.760]   there's you know it was no win because there's no way you can say the truth whatever the truth
[01:19:17.760 --> 01:19:24.400]   yes see part part of it is that you had you had the you had the human resources and the budget and
[01:19:24.400 --> 01:19:33.360]   the time to create a competitor to to a smart assistant box of video device so it's like that
[01:19:33.360 --> 01:19:37.760]   so that's that's not a damn a damning sort of thing to accuse them of it's just that it really
[01:19:37.760 --> 01:19:43.840]   does say that if companies that want to do things find ways to make that thing happen apple
[01:19:43.840 --> 01:19:49.120]   wanted to be get into the twelve thousand dollar gold super premium watch market they
[01:19:49.120 --> 01:19:53.760]   moved heaven and earth to make that happen so it's just that's why it just it's it's obviously
[01:19:53.760 --> 01:19:57.840]   disingenuous when they say that oh gosh if only we had the manpower that's why that's why
[01:19:57.840 --> 01:20:03.840]   i just think it would cost them nothing to say that we don't find the ipad to be a priority for us
[01:20:03.840 --> 01:20:07.920]   why i think that's what he's saying i mean if it was a priority you're right it is just
[01:20:07.920 --> 01:20:11.840]   not a priority and he's got a lot of other fires to there's a bunch of other fires and this one
[01:20:11.840 --> 01:20:15.680]   doesn't matter to us you know like it's not you know yeah he's just saying we're just
[01:20:15.680 --> 01:20:23.360]   would take time away from our stealing candy from infants but we shouldn't we shouldn't
[01:20:23.360 --> 01:20:27.360]   underestimate is not just hiring a programmer to manage it no no of course it's a team it's a
[01:20:27.360 --> 01:20:30.640]   process you're talking about them committing ten to twenty million dollars a year or two
[01:20:30.640 --> 01:20:35.680]   wow just something to to to support it minimum minimum like ipad support would cost them at
[01:20:35.680 --> 01:20:38.800]   least ten to twenty million dollars a year they might have to switch to single-play new
[01:20:38.800 --> 01:20:42.640]   play bathroom paper and the thing is is that for that someone someone's making a decision
[01:20:42.640 --> 01:20:46.560]   internally that says is it worth twenty million dollars and everyone's saying no not worth it
[01:20:46.560 --> 01:20:50.560]   we're not gonna get we're not gonna get anything more out of it i also think it is so valuable
[01:20:50.560 --> 01:20:56.480]   for them to have apps on your phone oh yeah that's why facebook has separate apps for for
[01:20:56.480 --> 01:21:02.560]   what's app and for instagram and facebook in fact for a long time facebook have many facebook apps
[01:21:02.560 --> 01:21:06.240]   and that's so valuable for them that they don't want to do anything that might reduce the number
[01:21:06.240 --> 01:21:10.240]   of people who have it on their phone yeah right right that's the most valuable place for right
[01:21:10.240 --> 01:21:14.160]   well and the question is if you have an ipad they know that you have a phone and the phone is
[01:21:14.160 --> 01:21:17.280]   more valuable to them why would they give it to you on your ipad right why would they exactly
[01:21:17.280 --> 01:21:20.560]   because you if you have an ipad you have an ipad every minute you're using on the ipad you're
[01:21:20.560 --> 01:21:24.400]   not using it on the ipad well and and again there's there's no upside you're just gonna go oh
[01:21:24.400 --> 01:21:27.760]   like they just know that the average user will go oh i really wish this is an ipad i'm just now
[01:21:27.760 --> 01:21:31.200]   gonna use my phone like they're not gonna stop using instagram because it's not on ipad
[01:21:31.200 --> 01:21:37.120]   at least they support the web now somewhat little bit little bit i mean i can i now can look at
[01:21:37.120 --> 01:21:42.640]   instagram photos i you know i don't use my favorite thing now is you see an instagram link and you tap
[01:21:42.640 --> 01:21:47.600]   on it and it opens the web page because the the quick links are often broken in betas and then
[01:21:47.600 --> 01:21:51.040]   you press another button and it says do you want to open this and instagram and you press yes and
[01:21:51.040 --> 01:21:54.800]   takes you to the app store to download to download instagram which you already have installed and
[01:21:54.800 --> 01:21:59.440]   there's just no way to actually see what you clicked on yeah ever i i just hate it when like i'm i'm
[01:21:59.440 --> 01:22:04.240]   in a coffee shop but i'm like commenting on something on instagram and of course as soon as i hit post
[01:22:04.240 --> 01:22:08.800]   i think oh that's right you you didn't end that sentence when you when you edited it and now i
[01:22:08.800 --> 01:22:13.520]   have to actually go out and get my phone because that that kind of etiquette be done or deleting
[01:22:13.520 --> 01:22:18.000]   an etiquette whatever it is can't be done in the ipad on the ipad through the web app i have to do
[01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:25.440]   on the phone app so oh well i have to admit i'm starting to rethink my uh extreme position on
[01:22:25.440 --> 01:22:30.720]   facebook and instagram i kind of miss instagram a little bit that's a weak link lino i can't
[01:22:31.520 --> 01:22:37.040]   i nuked facebook and i have a heart i can't put instagram it's how they keep you yeah and and
[01:22:37.040 --> 01:22:41.680]   part of it is like lisa will say oh well yeah they had a baby i said who what they when how did you
[01:22:41.680 --> 01:22:47.600]   know that oh it's on instagram right and i don't i don't know all this stuff not that i really care
[01:22:47.600 --> 01:22:55.520]   if you had a baby i'm sorry i don't really get for lio means he's sorry that you would have
[01:22:55.520 --> 01:22:59.440]   a baby see it not that you started yeah i'm sorry you had a baby and i'm sorry
[01:22:59.440 --> 01:23:05.360]   unless your name is you let's just hope that the baby takes after the mother let's just say
[01:23:05.360 --> 01:23:09.760]   and i'm not talking about florin scion who did have a baby and i knew it i'm very happy for flow
[01:23:09.760 --> 01:23:15.920]   yeah baby mona it's so sweet yeah no i wasn't talking about her yes
[01:23:15.920 --> 01:23:22.320]   i did it you know that you know that if we uh uh because that's my new york city trip i was that we
[01:23:22.320 --> 01:23:26.880]   were going to record roughly when she was going to go into labor but i can't but i decided to do
[01:23:26.880 --> 01:23:31.200]   some sensible and stay home and extra day to do record and regular time she could we could have
[01:23:31.200 --> 01:23:35.760]   had one of those sitcom experiences where she goes into labor on skype and i have to be her
[01:23:35.760 --> 01:23:42.080]   labor coach by a skype yeah or delivered in the cab or click through oh man we would i was i was
[01:23:42.080 --> 01:23:46.000]   saying we we would have definitely been invited to be on elin if that had happened definitely
[01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:52.160]   apple i don't use apple music that much i'm a subscriber but uh uh apparently people really
[01:23:52.160 --> 01:23:58.320]   like the 2019 replay list yeah do you use that the 2020 list is out now what is it
[01:23:58.320 --> 01:24:06.320]   it's it's like um spotify's version of the end of the year it just kind of like um
[01:24:06.320 --> 01:24:11.680]   aggregates together the data of all this stuff that you've listened to i i didn't think it was that
[01:24:11.680 --> 01:24:18.240]   exciting i think honestly spotify does it a lot better there's so much sharing like social
[01:24:18.800 --> 01:24:25.600]   interaction that goes on with the way spotify does it there's so much more data understanding
[01:24:25.600 --> 01:24:30.560]   of it i think it's it's in beta it says it you know apple says it's in beta so i think they have a
[01:24:30.560 --> 01:24:36.720]   lot to do to grow maybe letting us know right now that there that your 2020 spilliness are already
[01:24:36.720 --> 01:24:41.200]   populating maybe that's a way to get us more excited about it so that at the end of the year it
[01:24:41.200 --> 01:24:46.960]   actually is something interesting that we want to share with people but it definitely i was really
[01:24:46.960 --> 01:24:51.200]   excited about it when it first came out last year and then i went and looked at it was like
[01:24:51.200 --> 01:24:54.560]   here's the song that i listened to the most here's the album i listened to the most
[01:24:54.560 --> 01:25:00.560]   and that's it that's it there we go that's you know it's in the for you tab it's in the
[01:25:00.560 --> 01:25:06.480]   it's on the web i don't i don't think you can use it yeah i don't think you can use it on your phone
[01:25:06.480 --> 01:25:11.600]   yet or on your on your tablet yet you can only use it on the web okay i mean like it's super weird
[01:25:11.600 --> 01:25:18.240]   for apple yeah well it's in beta so they like they're it's it's got a ways to go but the only way
[01:25:18.240 --> 01:25:23.680]   they can you know decide how how to move forward with it is for everybody to try it out and test it
[01:25:23.680 --> 01:25:29.040]   i think so that's why the 2020 version won't be ready till the end of the year but they just
[01:25:29.040 --> 01:25:33.840]   want you to know we're we're watching what you're doing i think it's already aggregating i think
[01:25:33.840 --> 01:25:39.040]   it's you can already see what is the most the songs you've listened to the most in the first
[01:25:39.040 --> 01:25:44.000]   month of the year so that it'll constantly be updating so when you know at the end of
[01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:49.200]   february you'll have a little bit more data that aggregates what you listen to in january and february
[01:25:49.200 --> 01:25:54.800]   and separates out you know what you listen to in january versus february so i believe that's
[01:25:54.800 --> 01:25:59.680]   their their goal is to like kind of every month give you an update on like all the stuff that you
[01:25:59.680 --> 01:26:04.640]   had been listening to recently which makes me think that at the end of 2020 they'll have a better
[01:26:05.840 --> 01:26:12.480]   like like summary or or display of all of your data to help it kind of make it a little more
[01:26:12.480 --> 01:26:17.040]   interesting and fun which is kind of what what spotify i think does really well is they they give
[01:26:17.040 --> 01:26:21.440]   you that this data in a really fun way it makes you want to share it with everybody on on your
[01:26:21.440 --> 01:26:26.320]   social means which is why it got to be so big we're gonna do our picks of the week in a second but i
[01:26:26.320 --> 01:26:34.000]   i would be remiss if i did not mention that redesigning sonic the hedgehog paid at cost at a cost of
[01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:41.440]   millions paid up ten meetings sir you mean fixing side that you are fixing he's not minor paid off
[01:26:41.440 --> 01:26:48.560]   customer feedback it's valuable listen to it what was wrong with sonic was he was it i remember
[01:26:48.560 --> 01:26:53.040]   pikachu was too fuzzy they gave him teeth they made him tall i mean it was just there's a pitch
[01:26:53.040 --> 01:27:00.080]   meeting it was it his legs were really it was disaster it was disaster in a suit yeah it was
[01:27:00.080 --> 01:27:05.520]   so was cats it was cat's bed there there yeah can't believe james all the work that we just
[01:27:05.520 --> 01:27:10.800]   take on cat but i love james cordon on the Oscars and his cats that was hysterical
[01:27:10.800 --> 01:27:17.840]   uh you gotta own it got on it you just gotta own it go all the way baby um so 70 million
[01:27:17.840 --> 01:27:24.720]   dollar opening weekend so i guess you know it might pay us off it might pay off uh by the way
[01:27:25.600 --> 01:27:33.200]   uh this is some sort of record i don't know maybe uh game record highest video game
[01:27:33.200 --> 01:27:40.800]   highest video game title ever beating detective pikachu and that's oh god it's cruising out
[01:27:40.800 --> 01:27:46.400]   that's the original yeah if you're making a sonic movie just make sonic that's all you have to you
[01:27:46.400 --> 01:27:51.200]   have one job literally one job make sonic but it looks like it's like they put somebody's dentures
[01:27:51.200 --> 01:28:00.640]   inside of a stuffed taxidermied sonic he also had shorter more human looking legs instead of like
[01:28:00.640 --> 01:28:05.440]   the tall skinny legs that that he has and so that was really off putting too because it kind of
[01:28:05.440 --> 01:28:10.720]   looked like a guy without any kind of suit was it i mean it does it looks like i mean it actually
[01:28:10.720 --> 01:28:16.080]   was it just kind of looked like it yeah oh thank god they did it wasn't it's it's amazing when
[01:28:16.080 --> 01:28:18.080]   you know we now have these
[01:28:18.080 --> 01:28:23.680]   give me the jeepers it's coming back and for
[01:28:23.680 --> 01:28:31.600]   for not those not watching video they're shifting back and forth but this is the real sonic and the
[01:28:31.600 --> 01:28:36.720]   scary sonic how hard is that to do Alex they went back through the whole movie right they replaced
[01:28:36.720 --> 01:28:42.160]   it expensive they have to redo all the seed cost all the all the money i wouldn't be that surprised
[01:28:42.160 --> 01:28:47.120]   if they had this model originally but then the everyone else in the production wanted to go for
[01:28:47.120 --> 01:28:53.200]   a more realistic design and then once you saw the reaction to the this this design right here
[01:28:53.200 --> 01:28:57.520]   they just kind of went back and worked with the older models they had before yeah but that it's
[01:28:57.520 --> 01:29:03.360]   like that looks like the fantastic mr fox it looks like you have anematronic yeah i mean you're
[01:29:03.360 --> 01:29:08.160]   gonna have to you know you know you know you had to redo it they'd take it all out well take the
[01:29:08.160 --> 01:29:12.800]   original place they had to actually put out the ad they did it right now for it so they were
[01:29:12.800 --> 01:29:19.280]   rom-free i mean it would be a it's especially when it's your hero uh character it's not like it was
[01:29:19.280 --> 01:29:24.000]   in like 20 scenes in the middle you know it's the whole it's in every scenes in every scene or most
[01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:28.160]   of the scenes and so like the pokemon movie they used the pokemon models like they they did texture
[01:29:28.160 --> 01:29:32.240]   them they made them look more realistic but they was the actual like it looked like the pokemon this
[01:29:32.240 --> 01:29:38.880]   isn't sonic this is some other creepy yeah this is like the slender man version this is like so
[01:29:38.880 --> 01:29:45.520]   it's not it's not easy i'd stop it i would love i think one of the most interesting stories about
[01:29:45.520 --> 01:29:51.840]   about design is when they had to finally create like a 3d version of micky uh micky mouse and now
[01:29:51.840 --> 01:29:57.120]   they have to answer all kinds of questions that were never even on the table such as okay the
[01:29:57.120 --> 01:30:03.360]   his puzzle that no that the pink part of his muzzle is it skin or is there fur on it right
[01:30:03.360 --> 01:30:08.640]   now how do we animate his his ears in three dimensions even though even in two dimensions it's
[01:30:08.640 --> 01:30:13.920]   always been sort of uh there are always parallel to the plane of the camera so it's i'm not so we
[01:30:13.920 --> 01:30:18.160]   shouldn't we we're laughing we shouldn't say that it's a trivial thing but there's so many simple
[01:30:18.160 --> 01:30:25.360]   well not very super well okay see i i he's a movie star i can't compete with that you got to open
[01:30:25.360 --> 01:30:33.920]   it's not a good one massive sideburns i would have thought it was your fault can i can i can i
[01:30:33.920 --> 01:30:38.880]   can i just say that while i was in New York last week on my way back from the opera i stopped at a
[01:30:38.880 --> 01:30:44.640]   i stopped at a convenience store in brooklyn and a 20 to 20 a 20 year old a youth culture person in
[01:30:44.640 --> 01:30:51.200]   brooklyn approvingly complimented my outfit and said that it was quote swaggy as and then an
[01:30:51.200 --> 01:31:00.480]   ex-lative so i am i am swaggy and he issues the and he didn't try to so many thing nor was he
[01:31:00.480 --> 01:31:05.600]   trying to distract me while a partner of his was going through my my backpack was this uh the first
[01:31:05.600 --> 01:31:12.240]   example of a movie being saved by memes because it was it was vicious memes that really convinced
[01:31:12.240 --> 01:31:18.320]   paramount to redo this snakes on a plane maybe maybe snakes on a plane i don't know oh my god
[01:31:18.320 --> 01:31:25.920]   i'm just looking at this is the Forbes article where they showed some of the some of the memes
[01:31:25.920 --> 01:31:30.880]   uh that obviously terrified the movie company enough to to fix it
[01:31:30.880 --> 01:31:41.200]   oh yeah look there's oh look at that old version oh yeah there's it's like a guy in tights yeah
[01:31:41.200 --> 01:31:48.160]   yeah but the wrong way we shouldn't be like a sonic one we shouldn't be punishing these
[01:31:48.160 --> 01:31:53.520]   they they paid their penance by by remaking this movie we shouldn't be like re-airing their
[01:31:53.520 --> 01:31:58.560]   old mistakes we should be like they're like breaking it let this go celebrating yeah celebrating
[01:31:58.560 --> 01:32:08.000]   and celebrating the some of the memes are really funny yeah um all right let's save by the meme
[01:32:08.800 --> 01:32:15.520]   uh let's do the picks of the week shall we uh starting with you mr rene richie all right so

[01:32:50.960 --> 01:32:56.480]   saw this you mentioned that now you had the good sense to get it in black and white i think yeah

[01:34:23.360 --> 01:34:28.560]   go down to Cupertino that's very attractive it looks good yeah the original one was black they
[01:34:28.560 --> 01:34:32.160]   had one that was in black a couple years ago and they discontinued it and now they have just a
[01:34:32.160 --> 01:34:36.320]   very small amount of blue i don't know if they were testing it and decided to sell what they had or
[01:34:36.320 --> 01:34:40.640]   what what ever happened but they had them in stock yeah i don't know how punk navy blue is
[01:34:40.640 --> 01:34:46.720]   yeah black definitely is more more of a punk color yeah and i just ordered the chiro blanket
[01:34:46.720 --> 01:34:53.280]   that is awesome it is gorgeous yeah and i hope susan gets a big chunk of money from it because
[01:34:53.280 --> 01:34:58.880]   i i believe she's the greatest yeah yes they've got a great picture of her on that yep i was so
[01:34:58.880 --> 01:35:03.760]   i was so glad to click on that link and discover that no this was not someone doing a knockoff
[01:35:03.760 --> 01:35:09.040]   right this was they this is the creator getting acknowledgement for what they do which is i
[01:35:09.040 --> 01:35:13.840]   i can't say that i'm pure as the driven snow when if i see like a really cool like third party
[01:35:13.840 --> 01:35:19.040]   unlicensed t-shirt design of a character i was like oh i know that they create the i know that
[01:35:19.040 --> 01:35:23.280]   universal syndicate is being ripped off but i have to have it this is this is one where
[01:35:23.280 --> 01:35:28.240]   but it's susan care come on i i'm not gonna i'm not gonna buy a moof i'm not gonna buy a moof
[01:35:28.240 --> 01:35:33.200]   hat unless somehow she gets some money off there's an even nicer little geekier thing this was made
[01:35:33.200 --> 01:35:42.400]   on a jacard loom they made the very early computer controlled looms and uh and she designed a for a
[01:35:42.400 --> 01:35:50.000]   jacard loom so it was invented in 1801 and they were controlled by punch cards so it's even got a
[01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:57.600]   geekier provenance that's fantastic this is it's area all the way here dot com a r e a w a r e
[01:35:57.600 --> 01:36:02.640]   dot com it's the chiro got expensive hundred thirty five dollars i bought it immediately that's and i
[01:36:02.640 --> 01:36:06.400]   got the black and white that'd be silly to give me other color i would pay a lot more for susan's
[01:36:06.400 --> 01:36:09.360]   work i won't tell them how much more because i don't want to see that pricing change i know
[01:36:09.360 --> 01:36:15.680]   susan's the greatest that's so yeah and the picture of her in uh in 1984 sitting in front of her mac
[01:36:15.680 --> 01:36:21.760]   yep designing eye concepts lounging oh i should say it's not sitting such a good tip i i've had
[01:36:21.760 --> 01:36:25.360]   i've had an expensive month otherwise i would have just bought it right now but it's so it's on my
[01:36:25.360 --> 01:36:32.320]   list for next month yeah rick kon five says yeah navy blue flag failed as a name for a punk band
[01:36:35.840 --> 01:36:43.360]   they don't even have a shot that's my black flag cover band uh miss lory gill your pick of the week
[01:36:43.360 --> 01:36:51.120]   yeah so i am you are looking at me right now through logitech's new stream cam they sent it to me
[01:36:51.120 --> 01:36:59.200]   to test it out it looks nice i really like it it's it's real simple it's designed for people who are
[01:36:59.200 --> 01:37:04.800]   just getting started in the streaming um you know youtube streaming and internet streaming stuff
[01:37:04.800 --> 01:37:11.200]   it's simple easy to use it has just a little bit more than the basics it's not too complicated
[01:37:11.200 --> 01:37:16.160]   it comes with their software called capture which is actually where what what really makes
[01:37:16.160 --> 01:37:20.720]   that's a good product is and it's max software because that was for a long time a problem with
[01:37:20.720 --> 01:37:26.560]   logitech yeah good yeah they yeah they did find and they're calling it beta because there's one
[01:37:26.560 --> 01:37:33.280]   feature that they're still working on that is already available on pc but not quite they're not
[01:37:33.280 --> 01:37:38.640]   it's not quite perfect yeah on max so it has everything but one of the features is kind of
[01:37:38.640 --> 01:37:46.400]   still kind of glitchy so they're calling it beta but um so this camera streams um 1080p at 60
[01:37:46.400 --> 01:37:53.760]   frames per second so it's got a pretty decent quality it has usb c it it is a usb c device
[01:37:53.760 --> 01:38:01.760]   which is funny because right now i'm using it on my 2015 iMac that does not have a usb c port
[01:38:01.760 --> 01:38:08.320]   so i had to put it into a hub which is really funny but um it also has vertical and horizontal
[01:38:08.320 --> 01:38:14.720]   option you can just pull it out and clip it to another it has this typical mount but you it
[01:38:14.720 --> 01:38:23.120]   comes with a tripod mount threat tripod thread mount so it has much of different options to it
[01:38:23.120 --> 01:38:30.960]   it actually has its own microphone in it so if you don't even have a microphone yet you can literally
[01:38:30.960 --> 01:38:36.720]   just plug in and start streaming and so it's really great for brand new people who are just
[01:38:36.720 --> 01:38:42.160]   starting out on trying to stream stuff and and they they don't want to spend a bunch of money and
[01:38:42.160 --> 01:38:48.640]   they don't even necessarily know how to make that work so 170 dollars it's not the top of the line
[01:38:48.640 --> 01:38:55.280]   streaming services doesn't do 4k but it it does 1080p at 60 frames which is better than most 1080p
[01:38:55.280 --> 01:39:00.640]   those are usually 30 frames per second so this does 60 frames per second kind of jumps it up a little
[01:39:00.640 --> 01:39:05.680]   so if you are about to start blogging video blogging if you were about to start streaming on youtube
[01:39:05.680 --> 01:39:10.800]   and you're wondering what camera to get this should be your first camera this is a good starter camera
[01:39:10.800 --> 01:39:15.360]   for sure and this looks great now in the 60 frames is important if you're streaming for games because
[01:39:15.360 --> 01:39:18.880]   a lot of your games are going to be you're going to be streaming your games at 60p and so if you go
[01:39:18.880 --> 01:39:25.040]   back to 30p every time you come back to your camera um it's uh a bummer so the 60p important for the
[01:39:25.040 --> 01:39:29.600]   cameras yeah and the capture techs and technology that comes with it you actually can use the
[01:39:29.600 --> 01:39:36.320]   capture capture technology with um Logitech's entire webcam line but um what one great thing
[01:39:36.320 --> 01:39:41.920]   about it is that it allows you to do stuff like um half picture in picture so that it can stream
[01:39:41.920 --> 01:39:47.440]   from your desktop and up and the video of you in the bottom corner it's all built in into the capture
[01:39:47.440 --> 01:39:54.400]   technology which is really good for beginners it's certainly nowhere near good for people who have
[01:39:54.400 --> 01:39:59.120]   figured figured it out and are doing more but if you're just getting started that capture technology
[01:39:59.120 --> 01:40:04.320]   the the software that comes with the webcam is really good what does it say about it as soon as
[01:40:04.320 --> 01:40:08.320]   you came on everybody on the panel was like oh my god what did you do that was different your camera
[01:40:08.320 --> 01:40:12.880]   it's pretty good yeah what does it always look good but what does it say about our culture though
[01:40:12.880 --> 01:40:19.120]   that you could turn it sideways and shoot vertical it's that you know it's funny at first i thought
[01:40:19.120 --> 01:40:26.400]   oh no vertical video but i realized like a lot of influencers are only on things like instagram
[01:40:26.400 --> 01:40:32.560]   and facebook and twitter and that's that's the the long form like it there's no such thing as
[01:40:32.560 --> 01:40:39.200]   don't do vertical video anymore that's definitely changed completely so yeah the fact that this camera
[01:40:39.200 --> 01:40:42.800]   we really want to do nine by sixteen and i'd be like do you really you know like like it's really
[01:40:42.800 --> 01:40:46.400]   not great and and admittedly sometimes the use cases are not good if you have like two or three
[01:40:46.400 --> 01:40:50.560]   people sitting there together it's not a great thing but there's something about the reason they
[01:40:50.560 --> 01:40:54.240]   were asking for it though i mean yeah well i want to do it for some reason well didn't you think during
[01:40:54.240 --> 01:40:57.680]   the sam's announcement when they were doing the netflix tie-in and they all walked in with their
[01:40:57.680 --> 01:41:03.120]   with their uh galaxy s 20s that they were going to be low key announcing netflix portrait or netflix
[01:41:03.120 --> 01:41:09.120]   one vertical video you know what what's what i think is is going to happen is is you know quibi is
[01:41:09.120 --> 01:41:13.040]   already talking about it and i think that we're gonna see more people think talking about the idea
[01:41:13.040 --> 01:41:18.240]   of building you know shooting something that you can watch in nine by sixteen or sixteen by nine so
[01:41:18.240 --> 01:41:24.160]   you just turn your camera whichever direction you turn it it's going to give you an experience in
[01:41:24.160 --> 01:41:29.520]   that in that format but i think that the the nine by sixteen there's is something about a person
[01:41:29.520 --> 01:41:34.800]   talking to you that's more personal because is you don't have to worry about the background you
[01:41:34.800 --> 01:41:40.080]   notice this a lot on some of the instagram stuff tick-tock there's i don't have to worry about the
[01:41:40.080 --> 01:41:44.000]   background because because i'm blocking all of that and i don't have to think about what to do with
[01:41:44.000 --> 01:41:47.920]   digital native yeah and and when you're watching it especially if you're watching a lot of short
[01:41:47.920 --> 01:41:52.480]   form that's when i really find it so if i'm watching a bunch of one-minute things or 30 second
[01:41:52.480 --> 01:41:56.480]   things and i'm going to the next thing in or three minutes i don't want to keep turning my phone
[01:41:56.480 --> 01:42:01.600]   around so so you just get like i know that if i'm on tick-tock and i see a nine by 16 or 16 by nine
[01:42:01.600 --> 01:42:06.160]   it's weird i don't even watch it doesn't even get to the first second i just go no you know like
[01:42:06.160 --> 01:42:11.200]   because i because now i'm at the turn of my phone it's not good and i'm interested so so the and i
[01:42:11.200 --> 01:42:16.560]   for me to say that is a thing i didn't know like for me to say that i won't watch 16 by
[01:42:16.560 --> 01:42:22.640]   but but lory please don't do portrait when you call this just get i could literally switch right now
[01:42:22.640 --> 01:42:26.640]   do it do it do it let's see what happens let's see what it looks like it's pretty it's really easy
[01:42:26.640 --> 01:42:32.960]   to do it's just a noun we need those sounds on tv so i bet you this is what happens i turn sideways
[01:42:33.280 --> 01:42:38.800]   nothing hi there that's it that's probably skype right right doing yeah that might be the skype
[01:42:38.800 --> 01:42:42.560]   probably doesn't know what the hell to do you might have to jump out and jump back into yeah but
[01:42:42.560 --> 01:42:49.360]   you saw how easy that was and now i'm back when i face time my mom right face time by default is
[01:42:49.360 --> 01:42:55.360]   in portrait and i'll you know i'll switch it so what did you just do don't do that right she doesn't
[01:42:55.360 --> 01:42:58.800]   want to see me widescreen because she's holding her phone people who watch you two on she's gonna
[01:42:58.800 --> 01:43:02.880]   have to turn her phone in tiny windows on phones and they get complaints it's like why is the
[01:43:02.880 --> 01:43:07.200]   aspect ratio so what i'm watching this on a phone turn turn the phone they're like i don't want to
[01:43:07.200 --> 01:43:13.920]   no right i have it said so it won't flip Alex Lindsay pick of the week so if you want to edit it
[01:43:13.920 --> 01:43:17.760]   you know a lot of times you're not in front of your computer and you want a little bit more
[01:43:17.760 --> 01:43:21.760]   editing than i movie will provide or many of the other ones uh one of the things that i've been
[01:43:21.760 --> 01:43:26.640]   starting to experiment with a lot and i'm pretty happy with uh for a mobile editing is luma fusion
[01:43:26.640 --> 01:43:31.200]   oh good i've i've had that for a while it's really cool it's really cool like i'm kind of amazed at
[01:43:31.200 --> 01:43:37.120]   how much they put into this app so luma fusion is basically it feels probably more like final cut
[01:43:37.120 --> 01:43:43.600]   than um than anything else as far as how to edit so it's it's got a lot more tools and a lot more
[01:43:43.600 --> 01:43:48.720]   you can start really building up layers of of audio and video uh there are effects there's you
[01:43:48.720 --> 01:43:52.320]   know and you can it's gonna give you a lot more than you're gonna get out of i movie it costs a
[01:43:52.320 --> 01:43:55.920]   little bit of money it's 30 bucks but i mean 30 dollars for a full editing you wouldn't want to
[01:43:55.920 --> 01:44:00.640]   use that on the iphone though would you i haven't tried to use it on the iphone i've used it on my
[01:44:00.640 --> 01:44:07.200]   ipad and but but i don't like i try not to take my laptop out of my office very often anymore you
[01:44:07.200 --> 01:44:12.240]   know and so i what i found was is that i needed something that was gonna get me between when i'm
[01:44:12.240 --> 01:44:17.840]   home and using my using final cut and when i'm uh you know on the road and i want to be able to cut
[01:44:17.840 --> 01:44:23.200]   something to throw up and again it had it already has like an unlike final cut it has a nine by 16
[01:44:23.200 --> 01:44:28.720]   drop down if you want if you want to cut that um and it's got just a ton of tools and it's really
[01:44:28.720 --> 01:44:34.480]   they've done a great job at making it very intuitive uh to and they've got some great training um
[01:44:34.480 --> 01:44:40.960]   uh joseph lonaski who's a friend of mine um did incredible training on it so there's tons of
[01:44:40.960 --> 01:44:46.000]   youtube videos on how to get get started that you can just get for free and uh and so it's a great
[01:44:46.000 --> 01:44:51.360]   um it's a great app to um you know get off the if you're looking for something that's
[01:44:51.360 --> 01:44:56.720]   relatively inexpensive you can throw it on your ipad you can actually do real work on it
[01:44:57.360 --> 01:45:01.680]   this is this is a uh a great application i would highly recommend it
[01:45:01.680 --> 01:45:05.520]   and i'm gonna be using it a lot more on the road
[01:45:05.520 --> 01:45:08.160]   keep stalling yep
[01:45:08.160 --> 01:45:15.360]   anyway so but but there's uh no it's all right you can stop it it grabs onto your it grabs onto
[01:45:15.360 --> 01:45:19.920]   your um you know immediately jumps into i-photo so it's totally tied you know tied in and tied
[01:45:19.920 --> 01:45:24.240]   together so it's it's really easy to grab onto any of the assets that you've already that you that
[01:45:24.240 --> 01:45:28.160]   your grat that you're building and it feels like a very native i mean it don't it
[01:45:28.160 --> 01:45:32.160]   i mean it feels like there's so many video editing programs now there are not that
[01:45:32.160 --> 01:45:39.120]   i have muse major premier rush i have video leap clips but uh you really i did buy one a few
[01:45:39.120 --> 01:45:44.000]   i think i made an app cap a couple of you know months ago i'll and i'll admit that i
[01:45:44.000 --> 01:45:48.000]   what i found with a lot of the other ones and i'm still playing with all of them you know trying
[01:45:48.000 --> 01:45:51.680]   to figure out what's good for because because especially when you're building social media uh
[01:45:51.680 --> 01:45:57.120]   videos there are ones that are driven more towards those those things is this what you use for the
[01:45:57.120 --> 01:46:02.320]   valentine's i actually just final cut but i recut it in well i recut it in in this so you have the
[01:46:02.320 --> 01:46:08.240]   six nine by sixteen yeah yeah well i did it to to see like how hard we need to do the same thing and
[01:46:08.240 --> 01:46:15.600]   there was a couple so i used i have to admit that i was using um red giants uh um looks yeah as a filter
[01:46:15.600 --> 01:46:20.480]   and i use looks and i use the earthquake magic bullety yes this so this is a magic bullet applied to it
[01:46:20.480 --> 01:46:26.240]   and uh and then they're the shake the earthquake um plug-in oh you see that was subtle at the end
[01:46:26.240 --> 01:46:30.560]   yeah i like that i thought what did you do at the end when he eats his flower shakes yeah so what i
[01:46:30.560 --> 01:46:35.680]   did at the very end there is i just cut that clip and so right when he bites it i applied a earthquake
[01:46:35.680 --> 01:46:43.040]   filter to it and so that actually added a nice edge subtly yeah yeah and it's you know it it is um
[01:46:43.040 --> 01:46:47.920]   you're the alfonso de quarón of tic-tac what i love about it is is that we thought of it literally
[01:46:47.920 --> 01:46:51.840]   we talked about it at breakfast you could do it right we went out and shot it in 10 minutes
[01:46:51.840 --> 01:46:55.840]   and i had it posted half an hour later like it would have been faster than the animatics in between
[01:46:55.840 --> 01:47:01.360]   but still pretty good there's storyboard session we had to talk to the producer in l.a. you know it was
[01:47:01.360 --> 01:47:06.560]   it was a conference call yeah yeah yeah a bunch of like we move can we move clip four
[01:47:06.560 --> 01:47:11.680]   sixteen frames ahead because that's that's really what we do nice not to have a tail can we have a tail
[01:47:11.680 --> 01:47:16.480]   for that nice i love to do that and i and i love the fact that that whatever we do on tic-tac is
[01:47:16.480 --> 01:47:21.200]   better than most of what is there and so we have a lot of fun with just like i can just throw
[01:47:21.200 --> 01:47:24.960]   something up and and uh and it doesn't if it's not like this one there's a whole bunch of things
[01:47:24.960 --> 01:47:29.280]   i didn't like about it but i was like you know it's done i love it i'm going to work so don't be a
[01:47:29.280 --> 01:47:36.560]   perfectionist yeah yeah exactly uh tic-tac the mick dubbies t-h-e-m-c-d-u-b-b-y-s
[01:47:36.560 --> 01:47:42.880]   unaccountably still only 252 followers even though we've plugged it every show last month you know tic-tac
[01:47:45.200 --> 01:47:50.000]   doesn't really approve of kids having their own tic-tac even though this is my tic-tac channel
[01:47:50.000 --> 01:47:55.040]   my kids are on it and so uh so they tend to not they're not promoting it you don't you don't get any
[01:47:55.040 --> 01:47:59.360]   like you just go right into a black hole so unless people follow it them like directly it doesn't
[01:47:59.360 --> 01:48:03.440]   which is fine we're having we're having a great time did he swallow or did he spit he spit yeah
[01:48:03.440 --> 01:48:07.680]   i thought so because you don't want to really use those rows he was like he's like oh they do
[01:48:07.680 --> 01:48:11.200]   want to do it again he's like no i do not want to do that again he only did it once it was there was
[01:48:11.200 --> 01:48:15.120]   one this was one take i'm really glad i got the camera angle right because he was yeah he wasn't
[01:48:15.120 --> 01:48:19.920]   gonna do that he was not gonna do that a second there only a dozen to start with so yeah mr.
[01:48:19.920 --> 01:48:25.280]   Andy and i co pick of the week sir uh mine is the most tech pick of the week at all it is
[01:48:25.280 --> 01:48:31.920]   nasa's lunar lander who will lander can i buy that yet or is yes you can for a hundred bucks but
[01:48:31.920 --> 01:48:38.480]   the sum of some league is required uh it's the lego lunar lander oh it's lego it got it was released
[01:48:38.480 --> 01:48:43.920]   recently just a few months ago and it is incredible because it's not just okay you built something
[01:48:43.920 --> 01:48:50.000]   that is shaped like the lunar lander it's like well by the time you put i've just i've just ordered
[01:48:50.000 --> 01:48:55.440]   it i just ordered it today my so i've my thanks to everybody on twitter who occasionally during
[01:48:55.440 --> 01:49:00.080]   like black friday if i tweeted out a link to a deal like on a dvd or on a book or something that i
[01:49:00.080 --> 01:49:05.680]   thought was really really cool uh i get i got one big windfall of amazon credits a year for and
[01:49:05.680 --> 01:49:09.680]   every year i spend them exclusively on things that are gonna i'm gonna have fun with and this was
[01:49:09.680 --> 01:49:15.200]   one of the things i bought with this my windfall came today and so uh not only is it the lander
[01:49:15.200 --> 01:49:20.240]   like on the lunar surface with like little little lego footprints that letting up to the to the flag
[01:49:20.240 --> 01:49:27.200]   not only do you get uh buzz and kneel but you can you you you might have expected if this is a good
[01:49:27.200 --> 01:49:33.280]   model that you can detach the orbiter from the lander part okay but you can also you can also like
[01:49:33.280 --> 01:49:39.040]   open up a shelf on the side of the lander to reveal the cameras that were used to take the take the
[01:49:39.040 --> 01:49:45.040]   video of the of the of the uh planning the flag and the first footsteps on the orbiter you can
[01:49:45.040 --> 01:49:49.920]   actually like take off the sides of it to look inside to see the crew module like and see how it
[01:49:49.920 --> 01:49:55.200]   was configured inside it's like a thousand pieces so it's gonna you're gonna have a lot of fun putting
[01:49:55.200 --> 01:50:00.640]   together but you're also gonna like okay so that so that's where the rcs ecosystem is oh okay so i
[01:50:00.640 --> 01:50:06.160]   didn't know where where that was in relationship to that pad so it's kind of arrived fortunately
[01:50:06.160 --> 01:50:12.800]   good timing it's not going to arrive till tomorrow so i will probably be finished building it by the
[01:50:12.800 --> 01:50:18.720]   time by by next week's show if had it arrived on sunday or monday i might be making it excited i
[01:50:18.720 --> 01:50:23.440]   might be just basically doing the show like side saddle i'm still playing with my lunar lander
[01:50:23.440 --> 01:50:29.200]   well we expect to see it next week i was okay i will you can also you can also by the way you can
[01:50:29.200 --> 01:50:32.800]   also get a lighting kit for it they're like a couple of different people who've made third-party
[01:50:32.800 --> 01:50:37.840]   lighting kits you can install inside so it's illuminated already as i'm ordering it i'm thinking
[01:50:37.840 --> 01:50:42.560]   ooh and when i finish it i want to like get a museum style vitrine to like put the glass case
[01:50:42.560 --> 01:50:48.560]   to put on it anyway i'm really happy thank you thank you it's only a hundred bucks it's like the
[01:50:48.560 --> 01:50:52.640]   amount of happiness that i'm experiencing just knowing that it's arriving tomorrow is worth at
[01:50:52.640 --> 01:50:58.240]   least 40 of those dollars and and as berg pointed out for those of you who are doubters proof positive
[01:50:58.240 --> 01:51:04.880]   we did land on the moon exactly we do it you know i get you you you joke but in seriousness part
[01:51:04.880 --> 01:51:11.200]   is so complete you also get the laser reflector that they left on the moon so that you could so
[01:51:11.200 --> 01:51:15.840]   that nasa could fire a laser from the earth like to calculate the distance between the earth and
[01:51:15.840 --> 01:51:20.880]   the moon they really this was not like uh this was not like hey i got a box of lego let's build it
[01:51:20.880 --> 01:51:25.680]   it's like no let's build something as close to a model uh as possible so i love it they have the
[01:51:25.680 --> 01:51:32.480]   Apollo landing computer right there this is exactly this is so cool i i wouldn't even put a pass in
[01:51:32.480 --> 01:51:37.840]   that there is like a square brick and a round brick representing the differences between the
[01:51:37.840 --> 01:51:43.600]   the air scrubber filters in the in the lander versus section versus the uh what they had in the
[01:51:43.600 --> 01:51:48.160]   other part in the orbiter if you've always wondered what's behind the screen and he's sitting in front
[01:51:48.160 --> 01:51:54.080]   of there it is there's his there's beautiful studio and uh the lunar lander i just i just sit there
[01:51:54.080 --> 01:51:59.520]   and quietly cry while i wait for another chance to be on the on twitter andrew thank you so much
[01:51:59.520 --> 01:52:05.120]   when are you going to be on wgph uh friday at looks like one p.m and will be at the boston public
[01:52:05.120 --> 01:52:10.480]   library so the studio is at wgph and the uh the johnson building of the boston public library
[01:52:10.480 --> 01:52:15.360]   come on in get yourself a cookie in a cup of coffee and again watch me gesture with
[01:52:15.360 --> 01:52:20.080]   wild leaf my hands as i explain concepts knowing full well that this is radio and no one can see me
[01:52:20.080 --> 01:52:26.640]   awesome i'm more dot com slash vectors where you're going to find uh mr rene richie god i don't know
[01:52:26.640 --> 01:52:31.360]   how you find time to do anything but make vector shows you make so many and they're so beautiful
[01:52:31.360 --> 01:52:36.160]   and they're so good oh thank you so much uh why the iphone 12 needs smart zoom
[01:52:36.160 --> 01:52:41.200]   oh zoom is another thing that i don't want to have to take my camera out for i want my phones to do
[01:52:41.200 --> 01:52:46.880]   all the zoom you're actually comparing it to the zoom on the s 20 i think in a perfect world apple
[01:52:46.880 --> 01:52:50.720]   because you know like google is all in on super res zoom which is software they have really
[01:52:50.720 --> 01:52:54.560]   commodity cameras on that thing and samson doesn't do a lot of very good machine learning but they
[01:52:54.560 --> 01:53:01.280]   have they like wawe have these monster periscope uh lenses uh cameras on their phones i would like
[01:53:01.280 --> 01:53:06.480]   like a much more capable zoom and apple smart because they're all repurposing smart hdr their
[01:53:06.480 --> 01:53:10.400]   hdr pipelines to do it that would just be a perfect blend of both and then i could leave
[01:53:10.400 --> 01:53:16.240]   another lens at home when i go out and yesterday you addressed the question where is the iphone flip
[01:53:16.800 --> 01:53:21.440]   for those who are listening today thank you and tomorrow no spoilers but i should have
