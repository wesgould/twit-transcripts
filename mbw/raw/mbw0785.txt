[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.400]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly Alex Renee and Andy.
[00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:05.400]   They're all here.
[00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:08.320]   We'll talk about Renee's review of the new iPad mini.
[00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:10.240]   I think we all like it quite a bit.
[00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:15.040]   The EU says it should be Type C for everything Alex Lindsay thinks.
[00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:18.520]   That's a terrible, terrible idea.
[00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:19.520]   And the new iWork is here.
[00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:20.980]   The new iWork is here.
[00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:24.680]   All that and lots more to talk about next on Mac Break Weekly.
[00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:37.720]   This is Mac Break Weekly, Episode 785.

[00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:33.360]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly, the show we cover the latest news from Apple.
[00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.360]   Which of which there is very little.
[00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:36.920]   But that's okay.
[00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:37.920]   That's okay.
[00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:38.920]   Renee Richie is here.
[00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:39.920]   He's got the new iPad mini.
[00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:43.760]   We could talk about that from youtube.com/ReneeRitchie.
[00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:47.800]   Oh, I see you went with the lavender cover.
[00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:51.080]   I went with what do they call this?
[00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:52.280]   Interstellar white?
[00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:53.280]   That's ridiculous.
[00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:54.840]   It's just so for.
[00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.840]   And we'll make the news, Leo.
[00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:58.040]   We don't need those thinking news.
[00:01:58.040 --> 00:01:59.040]   We are the news.
[00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:00.040]   We are the news.
[00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:03.400]   And then I went with the white cover which I'm already regretting.
[00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:05.120]   I'm going to have to get some of those.
[00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:07.120]   Mr. Clean abrasive.
[00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:08.120]   Yeah.
[00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:09.840]   Just to clean that up.
[00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.200]   Just like I do with my white Adidas.
[00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:13.200]   But I do like this.
[00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.800]   And yeah, this is just because we didn't have the camera.
[00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:17.320]   But just to show you.
[00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:19.000]   That's so small.
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.080]   Interstellar is the same as Starlight.
[00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:23.080]   Starlight.
[00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:24.080]   Whatever that whole thing.
[00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:26.840]   It's silver with a hint of gold, Leo.
[00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:28.120]   Okay.
[00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:30.120]   But for people who are saying, where is this silver?
[00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:31.120]   It's silver with a hint of gold.
[00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:32.760]   Silver, that's the one you want.
[00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:35.520]   Andy and I go zero WGBH Boston.
[00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:38.520]   See, that's the thing.
[00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:42.320]   If you order the egg shell and they sent you the ivory, you're going to send that stuff
[00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:43.320]   back.
[00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:44.480]   Because that's not what you're ordered.
[00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:48.840]   I need my perfect bone shade of white.
[00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:50.840]   Oh, with this, a whole other thing.
[00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:51.840]   Yeah.
[00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:56.240]   And also with this from Office Hours and 090.media.
[00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:57.240]   Mr. Alex.
[00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:58.240]   I like gray.
[00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:02.480]   As you can see, I like to have different versions of gray.
[00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:03.480]   You just like to do.
[00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:04.560]   You just want gray.
[00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:09.480]   You don't disagree with Apple who says pros don't want color.
[00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:10.480]   That's true.
[00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:14.440]   The problem is is that when you're doing work with color, you don't want to do it.
[00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:15.440]   You don't want any other colors.
[00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:16.440]   Yes.
[00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:20.120]   That's the big issue is because they contaminate your vision.
[00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:21.120]   Shh.
[00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:22.120]   Okay.
[00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:23.120]   No contamination here.
[00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:24.120]   Exactly.
[00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:26.840]   We could talk about the mini.
[00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:29.600]   Did you put your review up yet, Renee, for the mini?
[00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:30.600]   I did.
[00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:31.600]   I did.
[00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:32.600]   We couldn't talk about it last week.
[00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:33.600]   I quite like it.
[00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:36.800]   Because weirdly, the embargo on the mini was later than the embargo on the phone.
[00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:37.800]   It was the next day.
[00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:38.800]   It was just strange.
[00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:42.360]   Well, thank goodness, Leo, because I don't know how people who review more than just
[00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:45.640]   Apple stuff because I saw some people like that Android reviews and Apple reviews and
[00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:47.600]   the Microsoft Surface review.
[00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:48.600]   This is the crazy piece.
[00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:50.880]   I just think it's hard to get nine videos in two days.
[00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:51.880]   Yeah.
[00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:52.960]   Well, I have a different problem.
[00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:54.760]   I have to buy them all.
[00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:57.460]   It's a very expensive process.
[00:03:57.460 --> 00:04:00.680]   You have an Audi and not any problem.
[00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:01.680]   Yeah.
[00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:03.800]   But I was actually very happy about the mini.
[00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:06.680]   I think this is a really interesting form factor.
[00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:07.880]   We're Andy and I were talking about it.
[00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:09.640]   I decided, I think you agree, Andy.
[00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:11.920]   It's a content consumption device.
[00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:15.080]   It's too small really to do much typing on.
[00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:20.560]   I think that it's, it really is, I hate to be so banal, but it really is the definition
[00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:24.040]   of larger than a phone smaller than an iPad or smaller than a tablet.
[00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:28.680]   And that's for tasks too, where like you were saying, sometimes you spend so much time
[00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:30.120]   on Reddit, you spend so much time.
[00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:33.960]   I spend so much time like keeping up with news, reading, reading for that papers, reading
[00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:37.000]   books, news, any websites and perfect for that.
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:38.520]   I was last night I was reading a website.
[00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:40.000]   Lisa leaned over and said, what is that?
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:41.000]   Is it your Kindle?
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   No, it's the mini.
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:43.360]   So that's perfect.
[00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:44.360]   I said, yes.
[00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:45.360]   Yeah.
[00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:49.320]   And it is nice to have something where there, when I'm out of the office for like three
[00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:53.880]   or four hours, oftentimes I will just stick something with a large screen in my pocket
[00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:59.000]   because sometimes, I say more so when I was writing for the paper than for than now, but
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.240]   it's like something happened right now and I'll be, it'll be four hours for I can be
[00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:03.240]   back my office.
[00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:06.840]   I definitely need to write 800 words right here, right now on this park bench.
[00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:07.840]   I guess I could.
[00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:08.840]   And stuff like that.
[00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:09.840]   I would want to, but I could.
[00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:10.840]   Right.
[00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:15.360]   It fits right in my European carry all very nicely fits in my jacket pocket.
[00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:16.760]   I got it in my non hipster.
[00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:17.760]   Yeah.
[00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:18.760]   It's going to be a gene.
[00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:24.200]   And notice by the way, I keep the pencil on it and actually I was inspired by Omala
[00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:28.000]   who wrote a little piece about how much he likes his mini and he pointed out that while
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:32.560]   you wouldn't want to do a lot of data entry on it because the keyboard is so small, the
[00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:37.960]   scribble, the new scribble feature in iPadOS is just right.
[00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:42.360]   And the pencil is just right for a lot of the gesturey kind of things that you want
[00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:43.360]   to do.
[00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:47.440]   I think it's an instant notes and stuff like that because scribble is very accurate.
[00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:49.040]   You can write in accurate enough.
[00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:53.440]   I can write in Google searches into my browser and things like that.
[00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:56.480]   So I kind of feel like the pen, it's a, it fits very naturally with it.
[00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:59.400]   You can put one of these in your bag, Leo, but just like the purple version.
[00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:00.400]   Yes.
[00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:01.400]   See, I have that.
[00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:04.920]   Andy, remember Andy recommended that folding thing that you put the keyboard in.
[00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:06.000]   I have that.
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:07.000]   I don't want to.
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   That color match.
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.160]   That's two, that's as, that's bigger than the iPad.
[00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:11.880]   The whole point of this is compact.
[00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:15.440]   I think the pen is the really important piece of it because for instance, you know, I build
[00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:20.120]   a lot of, I probably build one or two slide decks a week.
[00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:23.520]   And I have a very specific pattern of how I do it is I lay it out.
[00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:24.520]   I put it out.
[00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:26.520]   I sound like Liam Neeson.
[00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:32.520]   I have a very specific pattern of specific set of skills.
[00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:33.520]   Yeah.
[00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:35.880]   That, that I've acquired over many years.
[00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:40.440]   So, so, but my pattern is that I, I go into notes and I, and I write out, I outline what
[00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:42.800]   I want to do, what, what the slides are going to say.
[00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:46.320]   I just find it easier to think about it in single words or lines.
[00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:48.080]   Then I go to my iPad and I draw everything.
[00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:49.800]   I draw every, I draw every slide.
[00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:52.080]   I just look at notes and I just draw every slide.
[00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:55.720]   And that a little, a little, it doesn't, I don't care how big the screen is.
[00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:58.200]   These are like chicken scratches of, I'm going to have this here and then I'm going to have
[00:06:58.200 --> 00:06:59.360]   a little thing that goes over here.
[00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:03.520]   And the reason I do that is because if you start building your slide deck, it's really
[00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:07.040]   easy for you to get caught up in like what picture and should these have rounded corners
[00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:08.560]   and what text am I going to use.
[00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:11.400]   And you don't want to think about that when you're trying to think about the whole story
[00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:12.720]   flow of your, of your deck.
[00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:13.800]   I have a phrase for that.
[00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:18.680]   And the computer editing lends itself to dicking around.
[00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:21.920]   I didn't want to say that.
[00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:26.520]   But yeah, that's the, you know, and that's the, dicking around is the enemy of productivity.
[00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:27.520]   Yeah.
[00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:30.600]   So, so what you do is you get the whole, first you get the outline done, then you get the
[00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:34.600]   visual story done and then you, and then you fill it all in with graphics and then you
[00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:35.640]   tweak it all and then you're done.
[00:07:35.640 --> 00:07:40.760]   And now the filling in with graphics and the tweaking, I do all in, in, on the desktop
[00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:45.120]   because the, it's too hard to do that in fine detail and on the iPad.
[00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:49.000]   But then I oftentimes present from my iPad, you know, so I either present it via airplay
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.560]   or I hook it up to an HDMI output.
[00:07:51.560 --> 00:07:54.440]   And I mean like 99% of the time I'm, I'm displaying.
[00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:59.360]   And so the mini, I hadn't bought it yet, but I decided last night when I was, I was
[00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:02.560]   using my large iPad and I was like, I really want a smaller one.
[00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:04.360]   I decided last night I have an order one.
[00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:07.440]   So the one, the one I don't have is the 11, which might be perfect.
[00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:08.440]   I don't know.
[00:08:08.440 --> 00:08:10.040]   The 12.9 is so big.
[00:08:10.040 --> 00:08:11.040]   It's a computer.
[00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:12.040]   It's a laptop.
[00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:13.040]   You know what?
[00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:14.040]   That's all I bought for a while.
[00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:15.040]   Yeah.
[00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:16.040]   Yeah.
[00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:19.480]   On Saturday, a certain person, M. Georgia Dow stole my 11 inch iPad for the exact same
[00:08:19.480 --> 00:08:20.480]   reason.
[00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:21.840]   She's been using a MacBook Air.
[00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:23.400]   She hated the 12.9 inch.
[00:08:23.400 --> 00:08:24.400]   She goes, what's this?
[00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:25.400]   It was just on the table.
[00:08:25.400 --> 00:08:26.400]   It was mining its own business.
[00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:27.400]   I was 11 inches wide.
[00:08:27.400 --> 00:08:28.400]   Why am I?
[00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:29.400]   I know.
[00:08:29.400 --> 00:08:30.400]   Yes.
[00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:34.360]   The mini is, the touch targets on it are really, really small.
[00:08:34.360 --> 00:08:35.520]   In fact, I don't know.
[00:08:35.520 --> 00:08:39.840]   You probably can't even see this, but my doc, which by the way seems to be able to expand
[00:08:39.840 --> 00:08:40.840]   infinitely.
[00:08:40.840 --> 00:08:41.840]   I don't know.
[00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:42.840]   At some point, I guess I'll run.
[00:08:42.840 --> 00:08:47.080]   But my doc, when it's in portrait mode, it's not, it's not terrible when it's in landscape
[00:08:47.080 --> 00:08:48.080]   mode.
[00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:51.280]   But when it's in portrait mode, those touch targets are so small.
[00:08:51.280 --> 00:08:52.280]   What's the story?
[00:08:52.280 --> 00:08:53.680]   It's a, there's a, there's a really funny story of that.
[00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:55.960]   So Steve Jobs did not want an iPad mini.
[00:08:55.960 --> 00:08:56.960]   He thought it was dumb.
[00:08:56.960 --> 00:08:57.960]   He rallied against small tablets.
[00:08:57.960 --> 00:09:01.200]   He's the guy who said, he said, you have to sharpen your fingers.
[00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:02.200]   Yeah.
[00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:03.200]   Yeah.
[00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:05.000]   And then Eddy Q got the Galaxy tab and he's like, this is great.
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.800]   We've got to make this and Tim's like, no, forget, sorry, and Steve's like, no, forget.
[00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:09.360]   He's like, no, we really got to make this.
[00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:10.360]   He's like, all right, fine.
[00:09:10.360 --> 00:09:13.920]   Like, like the same as iTunes on Windows, it's your fault if it fails.
[00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:14.920]   So they made it.
[00:09:14.920 --> 00:09:17.200]   And then the, the team was like, look, we just did an iPhone.
[00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:18.200]   We just did an App Store.
[00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:19.400]   We just did an iPad.
[00:09:19.400 --> 00:09:22.800]   We do not have time to make another complete interface for something.
[00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:24.880]   And someone said, well, why don't we just shrink it down?
[00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:25.880]   What?
[00:09:25.880 --> 00:09:26.880]   We shrink it down.
[00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:28.240]   It'll be the exact same size as the iPhone.
[00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:29.840]   We'll take the iPad interface.
[00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:34.800]   It'll shrink down to the iPhone tab target size and we'll just ship it so they didn't
[00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:35.920]   bother to make a whole new interface.
[00:09:35.920 --> 00:09:38.280]   They just used the iPad interface at iPhone density.
[00:09:38.280 --> 00:09:41.480]   Oh, that was interesting.
[00:09:41.480 --> 00:09:44.840]   That wasn't itself brilliant because that meant that you don't have to spin up developers
[00:09:44.840 --> 00:09:45.840]   on here.
[00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:48.040]   We need you to create new, new layer faces.
[00:09:48.040 --> 00:09:51.200]   It's just also that was a, that was a selling point for me when I bought mine.
[00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:52.840]   I think about the first generation.
[00:09:52.840 --> 00:09:56.820]   It was like, no, this will run all the apps that you would enjoy on the iPad at the original
[00:09:56.820 --> 00:09:59.200]   scale at the original size with no adaptations.
[00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:00.200]   And so that was like, great.
[00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:01.200]   Take it.
[00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:02.200]   Done.
[00:10:02.200 --> 00:10:04.880]   And yet iPhone apps aren't horrible on this.
[00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:07.360]   I mean, there, there's clearly still iPhone apps.
[00:10:07.360 --> 00:10:09.560]   You like Instagram because there's no like.
[00:10:09.560 --> 00:10:10.560]   Just stress me.
[00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:13.480]   Can you, can you make actual cell phone calls with it?
[00:10:13.480 --> 00:10:15.600]   If you have the cellular service, or is it always just no?
[00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:18.440]   The cellular service is a data only service.
[00:10:18.440 --> 00:10:22.800]   But so by the way, here's the Instagram app, which you can, it fills the screen nicely.
[00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:25.240]   But you can tell it's an iPhone app, right?
[00:10:25.240 --> 00:10:27.240]   It just doesn't quite have that.
[00:10:27.240 --> 00:10:31.000]   It breaks with every new iPhone because they hard-coded to every specific iPhone.
[00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:34.720]   And now I think they're just terrified of trying to make of recoding it to make an iPad
[00:10:34.720 --> 00:10:35.720]   app.
[00:10:35.720 --> 00:10:36.720]   And yet this is consumable.
[00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:38.560]   I mean, it almost fills the screen.
[00:10:38.560 --> 00:10:42.480]   It's, it's, it's, it almost feels like it's an iPad app on the main.
[00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:44.120]   It had something called size classes.
[00:10:44.120 --> 00:10:45.120]   Yeah.
[00:10:45.120 --> 00:10:47.360]   It could use to make it automatically fit any device.
[00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:50.160]   So I forgot what you, what were you, what were you saying?
[00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:51.160]   Alex, I forgot.
[00:10:51.160 --> 00:10:52.760]   I was just asking if you can make some.
[00:10:52.760 --> 00:10:53.760]   I just want to make a phone call.
[00:10:53.760 --> 00:10:54.760]   Because I, oh, that's right.
[00:10:54.760 --> 00:10:57.920]   This is a big question for me because I wanted to make this my phone.
[00:10:57.920 --> 00:10:58.920]   Right.
[00:10:58.920 --> 00:11:00.160]   Because I never pick up my phone.
[00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:01.160]   I never do this.
[00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:03.240]   I mean, I never put my phone up against my head ever.
[00:11:03.240 --> 00:11:04.240]   So it's.
[00:11:04.240 --> 00:11:05.520]   So your sim has a phone number.
[00:11:05.520 --> 00:11:09.960]   That's how the all the carriers work, but it doesn't work as a phone through the sim.
[00:11:09.960 --> 00:11:14.600]   However, there are plenty of services that will do database phone calls.
[00:11:14.600 --> 00:11:17.440]   Well, I, I, I do, I use Apple.
[00:11:17.440 --> 00:11:18.960]   I said FaceTime all the time.
[00:11:18.960 --> 00:11:20.280]   FaceTime audio all the time.
[00:11:20.280 --> 00:11:23.880]   Like, like literally that is my primary way of calling anybody with a blue, with a blue
[00:11:23.880 --> 00:11:24.880]   thing.
[00:11:24.880 --> 00:11:26.680]   And everybody else I schedule time to meet on zoom.
[00:11:26.680 --> 00:11:27.880]   So I'm playing with ways.
[00:11:27.880 --> 00:11:28.880]   Like I schedule it.
[00:11:28.880 --> 00:11:31.880]   Because what you really, the one thing missing is a way to call a phone number, a landline
[00:11:31.880 --> 00:11:34.560]   from your mini and Google voice will do that.
[00:11:34.560 --> 00:11:35.720]   Skype will do that.
[00:11:35.720 --> 00:11:36.720]   Yeah.
[00:11:36.720 --> 00:11:39.360]   There, there are plenty of programs that will do that.
[00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:41.360]   So I'm really.
[00:11:41.360 --> 00:11:45.960]   I guess my whole thing is, is that I can do something where 90, I can make 90% of the
[00:11:45.960 --> 00:11:47.960]   calls, 95% of the calls that I would normally make.
[00:11:47.960 --> 00:11:50.200]   And then I still have a phone for the things that need to.
[00:11:50.200 --> 00:11:53.640]   If you pay a little bit of money, you get a regular phone number with Skype, which I
[00:11:53.640 --> 00:11:54.640]   have.
[00:11:54.640 --> 00:11:55.640]   Right.
[00:11:55.640 --> 00:11:58.440]   And then that, this becomes the phone number of my mini.
[00:11:58.440 --> 00:12:04.280]   So yes, I think the answer is an increasingly so because LTE is, you know, voice over LTE
[00:12:04.280 --> 00:12:07.080]   now and everything's moving to data.
[00:12:07.080 --> 00:12:08.080]   I think it increases.
[00:12:08.080 --> 00:12:09.360]   Well, I found that it could be a phone.
[00:12:09.360 --> 00:12:13.000]   I found that that with, I don't know what's happened with cell towers, whether it's the
[00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:16.760]   5G or I don't know what it is, but it's gotten a lot worse recently.
[00:12:16.760 --> 00:12:17.760]   It is.
[00:12:17.760 --> 00:12:18.760]   And I actually find.
[00:12:18.760 --> 00:12:19.760]   Are you Verizon?
[00:12:19.760 --> 00:12:22.840]   I'm both Verizon and AT&T and both are worse.
[00:12:22.840 --> 00:12:24.320]   Lisa is complaining about that too.
[00:12:24.320 --> 00:12:26.160]   She threw out, I use T-Mobile.
[00:12:26.160 --> 00:12:29.000]   She said, no, I'm not going to use it for rises so much better.
[00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:31.040]   And now she's bitching because it's not so good.
[00:12:31.040 --> 00:12:34.280]   So I, at my house, which used to work just fine.
[00:12:34.280 --> 00:12:35.280]   Yeah.
[00:12:35.280 --> 00:12:38.200]   My cell phone numbers or my cell phone calls are falling apart all the time.
[00:12:38.200 --> 00:12:42.280]   And so I just decided to, that's why that's what moved me to the Apple FaceTime audio
[00:12:42.280 --> 00:12:45.320]   was, was that I suddenly had nice clear calls.
[00:12:45.320 --> 00:12:48.080]   And then I got so used to the quality of the FaceTime audio that I don't want to go back
[00:12:48.080 --> 00:12:49.080]   to the cell phone anytime.
[00:12:49.080 --> 00:12:53.840]   And so now I'm just driving and I just call with FaceTime audio unless I have to go to
[00:12:53.840 --> 00:12:54.920]   a cell number, you know?
[00:12:54.920 --> 00:12:56.920]   And so, which I don't have to do very often.
[00:12:56.920 --> 00:12:59.080]   So I don't talk to people on the phone that much.
[00:12:59.080 --> 00:13:05.440]   I guess the big question and I haven't tried this is if I use Skype and my Skype phone
[00:13:05.440 --> 00:13:10.240]   number, will this ring and let one of them have to have Skype open?
[00:13:10.240 --> 00:13:11.600]   No, I don't think so.
[00:13:11.600 --> 00:13:12.600]   I think if you have that.
[00:13:12.600 --> 00:13:14.960]   It has to be back rounded, but you can't kill it.
[00:13:14.960 --> 00:13:17.120]   If you force quit it, you'll have to restart it, but I think it'll go more.
[00:13:17.120 --> 00:13:19.000]   Let's say if I didn't force quit it.
[00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:20.680]   So it would work then, huh?
[00:13:20.680 --> 00:13:21.680]   I should try it.
[00:13:21.680 --> 00:13:23.760]   I have things calling all the time.
[00:13:23.760 --> 00:13:24.760]   Really?
[00:13:24.760 --> 00:13:25.760]   Signal.
[00:13:25.760 --> 00:13:26.760]   It's bugging you.
[00:13:26.760 --> 00:13:28.520]   Signal does it, right?
[00:13:28.520 --> 00:13:30.560]   What does WhatsApp allows phone calls?
[00:13:30.560 --> 00:13:31.560]   Next time messenger.
[00:13:31.560 --> 00:13:34.680]   The question is from a landline because we know if you can use FaceTime to anybody with
[00:13:34.680 --> 00:13:37.560]   an iPhone and I know you don't have any friends who don't have iPhones.
[00:13:37.560 --> 00:13:43.600]   But if you have friends that don't have iPhones, just don't talk to them on the phone.
[00:13:43.600 --> 00:13:45.600]   I'm not going to call you.
[00:13:45.600 --> 00:13:48.920]   It just doesn't happen that I don't do it on purpose.
[00:13:48.920 --> 00:13:51.000]   Let me try.
[00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:52.160]   I don't know.
[00:13:52.160 --> 00:13:56.680]   I guess the do not disturb rules and everything are going to still apply.
[00:13:56.680 --> 00:13:59.560]   Let me just try calling this.
[00:13:59.560 --> 00:14:04.040]   So I guess we're back at 10 digits here.
[00:14:04.040 --> 00:14:08.080]   I'm not going to give out this number because this is not one.
[00:14:08.080 --> 00:14:18.560]   If I close this and see if it'll ring, I'm calling it now for my phone.
[00:14:18.560 --> 00:14:21.280]   I don't think it's ringing.
[00:14:21.280 --> 00:14:25.360]   Maybe it takes a while to signal through.
[00:14:25.360 --> 00:14:26.360]   I completely...
[00:14:26.360 --> 00:14:27.800]   Apple should just put a phone app on it.
[00:14:27.800 --> 00:14:28.800]   That's what they should do.
[00:14:28.800 --> 00:14:29.800]   Yeah.
[00:14:29.800 --> 00:14:30.800]   No, they don't.
[00:14:30.800 --> 00:14:31.800]   They don't.
[00:14:31.800 --> 00:14:32.800]   Why they don't?
[00:14:32.800 --> 00:14:33.960]   They don't want you to buy this instead of an iPhone.
[00:14:33.960 --> 00:14:35.760]   It's half the price of an iPhone.
[00:14:35.760 --> 00:14:36.760]   Remember those old photos?
[00:14:36.760 --> 00:14:39.840]   They put giant Android tablets with phone apps and they put it next to their head as a joke.
[00:14:39.840 --> 00:14:41.320]   But they're like, "That's fantastic."
[00:14:41.320 --> 00:14:45.680]   This doesn't look very different than the Surface Duo.
[00:14:45.680 --> 00:14:46.680]   Next to my head.
[00:14:46.680 --> 00:14:47.680]   No.
[00:14:47.680 --> 00:14:50.560]   By the way, no one talks on the phone like this anymore.
[00:14:50.560 --> 00:14:51.560]   Have you noticed that?
[00:14:51.560 --> 00:14:53.480]   We were talking about this on Twig.
[00:14:53.480 --> 00:14:54.480]   Everybody talks like this.
[00:14:54.480 --> 00:14:55.480]   Well, I have AirPods.
[00:14:55.480 --> 00:14:56.480]   You know what?
[00:14:56.480 --> 00:14:58.400]   I have headphones or something.
[00:14:58.400 --> 00:14:59.400]   You need wireless cameras.
[00:14:59.400 --> 00:15:02.280]   They're all in public and they're on speaker and they're very loud and it's very weird.
[00:15:02.280 --> 00:15:03.800]   Yes, I'd love to say.
[00:15:03.800 --> 00:15:06.720]   They wait until they get to the quiet car of the Amtrak train before they decide, "Hey,
[00:15:06.720 --> 00:15:07.720]   hello."
[00:15:07.720 --> 00:15:10.160]   I'm hearing this argument with my boyfriend.
[00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:15.400]   "Mama, mama, mama, mama, mama, mama, mia."
[00:15:15.400 --> 00:15:19.360]   No, you're right.
[00:15:19.360 --> 00:15:23.840]   I think that the pass-through of phone calls to the device is under...
[00:15:23.840 --> 00:15:28.280]   The need for it is understated because I think all of us will say that getting an actual phone
[00:15:28.280 --> 00:15:31.520]   call is the least pleasant thing that we could ever do on our...
[00:15:31.520 --> 00:15:32.720]   Yeah, nobody wants that.
[00:15:32.720 --> 00:15:33.720]   We live our lives to make.
[00:15:33.720 --> 00:15:38.360]   But nonetheless, sometimes it really is the best solution to a problem, such as...
[00:15:38.360 --> 00:15:41.240]   I don't have to tell people what app do you have or what's your account name on this.
[00:15:41.240 --> 00:15:44.760]   It's like, "No, here is a 10-digit number that seems to work."
[00:15:44.760 --> 00:15:50.240]   As a matter of fact, every time, because it turned out to get a really good connection
[00:15:50.240 --> 00:15:56.200]   between my studio and WGBH studios in Boston, the simplest and easiest solution was to
[00:15:56.200 --> 00:16:01.160]   simply have me set up a Skype phone number and they will call me from their switchboard
[00:16:01.160 --> 00:16:02.480]   but it will still be like all Wi-Fi.
[00:16:02.480 --> 00:16:06.520]   So it's not going to be as good as directly internet connection, but at least it's better.
[00:16:06.520 --> 00:16:08.520]   And it was reliable.
[00:16:08.520 --> 00:16:09.520]   It works every single week.
[00:16:09.520 --> 00:16:13.040]   And there comes a point where it's like, "Which would you rather have a reliable connection
[00:16:13.040 --> 00:16:14.440]   that will always work?"
[00:16:14.440 --> 00:16:18.000]   And when you call me two minutes before, I'm supposed to be taking up 20 to 25 minutes
[00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:22.360]   of stroke time, or would you have something that's better quality but maybe it'll work,
[00:16:22.360 --> 00:16:23.360]   maybe it won't.
[00:16:23.360 --> 00:16:27.640]   Well, and I think that the other thing though is that because we get so much junk calls,
[00:16:27.640 --> 00:16:28.640]   you know, all these...
[00:16:28.640 --> 00:16:29.640]   Yeah.
[00:16:29.640 --> 00:16:32.440]   That I think that a lot of people like me, if I don't know what the number is, I never
[00:16:32.440 --> 00:16:33.440]   pick it up.
[00:16:33.440 --> 00:16:34.440]   I've just never...
[00:16:34.440 --> 00:16:35.440]   I just never...
[00:16:35.440 --> 00:16:40.600]   Can I say that that's one thing where I really wish Apple would put more work into because
[00:16:40.600 --> 00:16:46.080]   that's one area in which like a Pixel phone really shines because I don't answer the phone.
[00:16:46.080 --> 00:16:51.440]   Because my phone, I'll hear it ring, it will click to voicemail and instantly I'm seeing
[00:16:51.440 --> 00:16:54.640]   a live transcript of what whoever this is is saying.
[00:16:54.640 --> 00:16:57.960]   And if it's all gibberish, I know that it's somebody speaking in Mandarin trying to sell
[00:16:57.960 --> 00:16:59.200]   me a phone card.
[00:16:59.200 --> 00:17:04.920]   But if it's like, "Hi, Andy, this is your cousin Phil," and burst pipe, "Okay, hi Phil,
[00:17:04.920 --> 00:17:05.920]   what's going on?
[00:17:05.920 --> 00:17:06.920]   Hi."
[00:17:06.920 --> 00:17:07.920]   Right.
[00:17:07.920 --> 00:17:10.440]   And there's so many things you can do with the phone connection that would solve these
[00:17:10.440 --> 00:17:15.280]   problems that I think Apple is now well set up to make this as good a phone as it is at
[00:17:15.280 --> 00:17:21.080]   doing anything else instead of it being stuck into wherever they left it in like 2011.
[00:17:21.080 --> 00:17:25.200]   There is continuity call relay that'll let you answer regular phone calls on your iPad
[00:17:25.200 --> 00:17:26.880]   that route through your iPhone.
[00:17:26.880 --> 00:17:30.760]   But I'm trying it now and it's a reliable the other way.
[00:17:30.760 --> 00:17:31.760]   Again, yeah.
[00:17:31.760 --> 00:17:35.720]   Again, if it's something where a hospital is going to call me, they're not going to text
[00:17:35.720 --> 00:17:39.040]   me, they're not going to, "I am me on this message."
[00:17:39.040 --> 00:17:42.720]   They're going to try to call me to let me know about what's going on in a situation
[00:17:42.720 --> 00:17:43.720]   with a family member.
[00:17:43.720 --> 00:17:46.240]   And that's where you absolutely want a phone call to go through.
[00:17:46.240 --> 00:17:51.400]   If you were not to mistake it for a spam call and for everything to work with the phones,
[00:17:51.400 --> 00:17:54.960]   you were raised to believe that a phone system should work without the billing problems.
[00:17:54.960 --> 00:17:57.840]   We have to solve that by fixing the hospitals.
[00:17:57.840 --> 00:17:59.840]   Not the phones.
[00:17:59.840 --> 00:18:00.840]   Right?
[00:18:00.840 --> 00:18:02.760]   They really could text message us.
[00:18:02.760 --> 00:18:05.360]   I guess they want to know that they're talking to the right person.
[00:18:05.360 --> 00:18:07.160]   It's the privacy issues.
[00:18:07.160 --> 00:18:09.760]   Oftentimes, well, I'm sure that oftentimes they do.
[00:18:09.760 --> 00:18:16.720]   But again, it's the one, sometimes you just want that, the fact that you've got one simple,
[00:18:16.720 --> 00:18:21.720]   universal platform that everybody knows, understands, can support, that gives you the freedom to
[00:18:21.720 --> 00:18:23.120]   kind of freestyle a little bit.
[00:18:23.120 --> 00:18:25.320]   And say, "Now we can create an instant messaging platform.
[00:18:25.320 --> 00:18:28.520]   Now we can create a voice to text messaging platform."
[00:18:28.520 --> 00:18:32.680]   Because we know that if everything actually goes to crap, we can still fall back on dial
[00:18:32.680 --> 00:18:38.240]   this 10-digit number, a human voice or a robotic human voice, we'll give you the information.
[00:18:38.240 --> 00:18:40.400]   That's just basic.
[00:18:40.400 --> 00:18:42.920]   That's why SMS isn't going away anytime soon.
[00:18:42.920 --> 00:18:47.200]   That's why POTS isn't going away anytime soon.
[00:18:47.200 --> 00:18:50.320]   Because it's an infrastructure that just works as well.
[00:18:50.320 --> 00:18:51.320]   There are more pigeons.
[00:18:51.320 --> 00:18:52.320]   JT.
[00:18:52.320 --> 00:18:54.880]   I can't believe I used the acronym POTS.
[00:18:54.880 --> 00:18:58.320]   That's the first time in five years I've used plain old telvos system.
[00:18:58.320 --> 00:19:00.800]   My God, what kind of a nerd am I?
[00:19:00.800 --> 00:19:01.800]   JT.
[00:19:01.800 --> 00:19:02.800]   It takes us a long time.
[00:19:02.800 --> 00:19:03.800]   Exactly.
[00:19:03.800 --> 00:19:04.800]   We had to get it.
[00:19:04.800 --> 00:19:09.920]   In DC, we had to put a POTS line in for interacting with television stations for the
[00:19:09.920 --> 00:19:10.920]   IEPs.
[00:19:10.920 --> 00:19:12.880]   Then they just were, they had to be a POTS line.
[00:19:12.880 --> 00:19:18.560]   And we literally, it took us three months to get a copper, like, POTS line to install
[00:19:18.560 --> 00:19:19.560]   it.
[00:19:19.560 --> 00:19:21.800]   They were like, "Can't we just give you an IP?"
[00:19:21.800 --> 00:19:24.360]   And I went, "No, we need a POTS line."
[00:19:24.360 --> 00:19:30.040]   That's the radio station a couple of months ago, maybe a year ago now, said, "Turned off
[00:19:30.040 --> 00:19:33.360]   the ISTN lines because the phone companies don't want to support them.
[00:19:33.360 --> 00:19:36.360]   And we're over the public internet now using Comrex.
[00:19:36.360 --> 00:19:37.720]   And you would never know the difference."
[00:19:37.720 --> 00:19:39.600]   It's like, "Oh, wow."
[00:19:39.600 --> 00:19:42.480]   When you get it working, Comrex is kind of funny because when you get it working, it's
[00:19:42.480 --> 00:19:43.480]   great.
[00:19:43.480 --> 00:19:47.280]   When you don't get it working, it takes a little love to get it together through the
[00:19:47.280 --> 00:19:48.280]   system.
[00:19:48.280 --> 00:19:49.280]   I mean, we have a lot of bandwidth.
[00:19:49.280 --> 00:19:52.200]   We have a lot of room that the premier networks in Sherwin-Hok says.
[00:19:52.200 --> 00:19:53.200]   Good solid bandwidth.
[00:19:53.200 --> 00:19:54.200]   It's not bandwidth.
[00:19:54.200 --> 00:19:57.000]   Comrex, it's just traversing complicated pipelines.
[00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:58.360]   But if you have control of both ends.
[00:19:58.360 --> 00:19:59.360]   They must be.
[00:19:59.360 --> 00:20:01.160]   Comrex, they must be incredible.
[00:20:01.160 --> 00:20:03.520]   Like once you get it working, it's just like plug it in and you're like, "Hello, I'm
[00:20:03.520 --> 00:20:04.520]   here."
[00:20:04.520 --> 00:20:09.360]   So ISTN is only 128 kilobits, but that's enough for good quality audio.
[00:20:09.360 --> 00:20:14.240]   There's no limit on how much you could use in Comrex as a variety of codecs designed for
[00:20:14.240 --> 00:20:17.280]   the public telephone network.
[00:20:17.280 --> 00:20:23.840]   So somebody in our Discord chat, JT, who has the word, John, do you have Microsoft after
[00:20:23.840 --> 00:20:26.360]   your name because you work there or you just like them?
[00:20:26.360 --> 00:20:31.120]   He says, maybe he works there because he says, "I get Teams PSTN calls on my iPad all
[00:20:31.120 --> 00:20:32.360]   the time."
[00:20:32.360 --> 00:20:34.000]   So maybe Teams is the way to go.
[00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:35.800]   Well, there's a whole slew of them.
[00:20:35.800 --> 00:20:38.520]   Again, once they're opened and they're in the background somewhere, they call the--
[00:20:38.520 --> 00:20:39.520]   Oh, he works with Teams.
[00:20:39.520 --> 00:20:40.520]   No wonder.
[00:20:40.520 --> 00:20:42.720]   JT works with Teams.
[00:20:42.720 --> 00:20:43.720]   Okay, that's why.
[00:20:43.720 --> 00:20:44.720]   All right.
[00:20:44.720 --> 00:20:47.520]   But all of these will ring as a phone.
[00:20:47.520 --> 00:20:48.840]   Everything, all these different--
[00:20:48.840 --> 00:20:50.840]   But you need a number.
[00:20:50.840 --> 00:20:56.440]   So the thing is, when the hospital's calling, they have to have an area-- a 10-digit area
[00:20:56.440 --> 00:20:58.240]   code exchange for digit.
[00:20:58.240 --> 00:20:59.840]   They have to have that number to call.
[00:20:59.840 --> 00:21:02.680]   They don't care-- they don't know if it's a landline or not.
[00:21:02.680 --> 00:21:04.320]   I get that's important.
[00:21:04.320 --> 00:21:08.280]   I've never had a-- like 50 years, I've never had a hospital call me ever.
[00:21:08.280 --> 00:21:09.520]   Look, look at that as hope.
[00:21:09.520 --> 00:21:10.520]   You don't.
[00:21:10.520 --> 00:21:12.440]   That's never a good call.
[00:21:12.440 --> 00:21:16.120]   It's an edge case to me because I can't even imagine it because no one-- that's never
[00:21:16.120 --> 00:21:17.120]   happened before.
[00:21:17.120 --> 00:21:18.120]   But something was that important.
[00:21:18.120 --> 00:21:19.120]   I was at an hospital.
[00:21:19.120 --> 00:21:22.200]   Alex, it is-- but it is one hell of an edge case.
[00:21:22.200 --> 00:21:23.200]   I mean, I was--
[00:21:23.200 --> 00:21:25.200]   You don't want that call.
[00:21:25.200 --> 00:21:31.760]   I was off to China during a time where a family member was in a bad enough state that I was
[00:21:31.760 --> 00:21:35.800]   considering canceling, but not so bad that it made sense for me to cancel all these commitments
[00:21:35.800 --> 00:21:36.800]   that I'd made.
[00:21:36.800 --> 00:21:38.360]   And it really was.
[00:21:38.360 --> 00:21:42.400]   Until I reached the point of no return, I had the phone in my hand.
[00:21:42.400 --> 00:21:45.640]   There was a point in which, look, if something bad happens, you will not be able to get back
[00:21:45.640 --> 00:21:48.440]   in time to do anything about it.
[00:21:48.440 --> 00:21:53.760]   But that's why the security of having a phone in your hand that says that if I'm not getting
[00:21:53.760 --> 00:21:57.920]   a phone call about this issue, then clearly there's nothing to worry about at this time.
[00:21:57.920 --> 00:21:58.920]   So that's what I'm saying.
[00:21:58.920 --> 00:22:01.520]   I think my image case that's always going to be the most critical--
[00:22:01.520 --> 00:22:05.880]   I think part of it is I just have a very large family and a very large network in the
[00:22:05.880 --> 00:22:08.680]   sense that something like that happened, I'm getting texts.
[00:22:08.680 --> 00:22:13.600]   I'm getting texts or messenger or a group is formed.
[00:22:13.600 --> 00:22:17.800]   My father had a heart attack a couple years ago, and he's fine.
[00:22:17.800 --> 00:22:21.160]   But when he did, there's all these texts and there's things and I flew home.
[00:22:21.160 --> 00:22:23.320]   There was all that stuff that happened.
[00:22:23.320 --> 00:22:25.680]   But there was no phone calls.
[00:22:25.680 --> 00:22:30.600]   It was just like a lot of communication within the family to sort out what needed to happen.
[00:22:30.600 --> 00:22:34.680]   By the way, I love the way Microsoft-- I don't need a password anymore.
[00:22:34.680 --> 00:22:38.680]   I just enter in my Microsoft account and it sends a notification to the authenticator
[00:22:38.680 --> 00:22:39.680]   and I type in number.
[00:22:39.680 --> 00:22:40.680]   I love that.
[00:22:40.680 --> 00:22:41.680]   That's great.
[00:22:41.680 --> 00:22:47.520]   So what really got me upset with Skype is the fact that I had to recreate a password
[00:22:47.520 --> 00:22:49.280]   every single time I logged into it.
[00:22:49.280 --> 00:22:51.200]   Oh, so annoying.
[00:22:51.200 --> 00:22:55.520]   But now, so I've got-- so JTI installed Teams while we were talking.
[00:22:55.520 --> 00:22:58.520]   Oh, now it says, add your phone number.
[00:22:58.520 --> 00:23:01.680]   There you go.
[00:23:01.680 --> 00:23:06.680]   And then it's good.
[00:23:06.680 --> 00:23:10.480]   That reminds me of another reason why phone numbers are here to stay.
[00:23:10.480 --> 00:23:13.680]   They are a unique, portable identifier for customers.
[00:23:13.680 --> 00:23:14.680]   Yeah.
[00:23:14.680 --> 00:23:15.680]   That's exactly right.
[00:23:15.680 --> 00:23:19.080]   Especially now that you have a cell phone, it is the reason why Facebook and all these
[00:23:19.080 --> 00:23:22.680]   other marketers, they are so eager to get a mobile number off of you.
[00:23:22.680 --> 00:23:24.680]   And yes, as well, it's for two factor authentication.
[00:23:24.680 --> 00:23:26.280]   It'll keep your account safer.
[00:23:26.280 --> 00:23:29.960]   But it also means that if five, ten years from now, they want to still get a hold of
[00:23:29.960 --> 00:23:34.600]   you or identify you, you might move from place to place, but you'll probably still have
[00:23:34.600 --> 00:23:35.600]   the same certain number.
[00:23:35.600 --> 00:23:36.600]   The funniest one is that--
[00:23:36.600 --> 00:23:39.680]   And if three days, if you don't log into Facebook in three days, they start texting you the
[00:23:39.680 --> 00:23:41.200]   stuff that they think that you're missing.
[00:23:41.200 --> 00:23:42.200]   That is no joke.
[00:23:42.200 --> 00:23:44.200]   They started doing that to me.
[00:23:44.200 --> 00:23:47.360]   It's so annoying.
[00:23:47.360 --> 00:23:50.840]   The funniest one is that the two factor-- the funniest thing about two factor is that you
[00:23:50.840 --> 00:23:56.280]   have to, of course, for your-- to lock down your YouTube channel or whatever, you have
[00:23:56.280 --> 00:24:00.840]   to have the two factor, and I think they're going to force it in November or something.
[00:24:00.840 --> 00:24:04.080]   Anyway, the funniest thing, though, is that it's all the companies that you work with
[00:24:04.080 --> 00:24:09.320]   that some interns set up their YouTube that is no longer there.
[00:24:09.320 --> 00:24:12.680]   And so if you want to do a two factor and log in from a new location, there's no way
[00:24:12.680 --> 00:24:15.880]   to-- like, we'll just create a new event, new account.
[00:24:15.880 --> 00:24:19.840]   They can't figure out how to get out of the account that they have to get a new number.
[00:24:19.840 --> 00:24:24.240]   I think it's a reasonable thing that what will happen over time is that 10-digit code
[00:24:24.240 --> 00:24:29.600]   that is unique identifier will become your GUI, your unique identifier, and kind of
[00:24:29.600 --> 00:24:31.880]   detached from the telephone system.
[00:24:31.880 --> 00:24:34.760]   >> There's a huge web project trying to fix this.
[00:24:34.760 --> 00:24:37.400]   I know Apple is working with it, and I think Google is working with it to try to just get
[00:24:37.400 --> 00:24:42.240]   rid of passwords and have unique identifiers, and then one off random keys that are generated.
[00:24:42.240 --> 00:24:43.560]   But Google is already employing it.
[00:24:43.560 --> 00:24:47.400]   And sometimes one of the funniest things that happens, and I say funniest with my mouth,
[00:24:47.400 --> 00:24:51.440]   like, the T-Script so hard, is you'll see a bunch of reviewers start talking about random
[00:24:51.440 --> 00:24:55.160]   issues with logging into popular services several times a year.
[00:24:55.160 --> 00:24:59.160]   And like Google now, you still have authenticator, you still have the token, but there's no way
[00:24:59.160 --> 00:25:00.160]   to get it.
[00:25:00.160 --> 00:25:04.800]   All it says is check Gmail app on this phone that you may or not have anymore, may not
[00:25:04.800 --> 00:25:08.160]   have any power in it anymore, and there's nothing you can press to say, just let me
[00:25:08.160 --> 00:25:11.640]   use a token that is right there in your own authenticator app.
[00:25:11.640 --> 00:25:14.640]   So like, we're making progress, but losing our mind at the same time.
[00:25:14.640 --> 00:25:15.640]   >> Yeah.
[00:25:15.640 --> 00:25:16.880]   This is kind of my grand experiment.
[00:25:16.880 --> 00:25:19.880]   I'm not buying an iPhone 13.
[00:25:19.880 --> 00:25:25.000]   Yeah, I bought the mini, the mini is half the price.
[00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:29.560]   And if I could use the mini as a phone, the problem is of course the Apple solution is,
[00:25:29.560 --> 00:25:31.360]   oh yeah, you just have your iPhone.
[00:25:31.360 --> 00:25:33.480]   >> But when you're iPhone is phone.
[00:25:33.480 --> 00:25:35.280]   >> And then use your iPhone.
[00:25:35.280 --> 00:25:41.680]   But yeah, I'm curious if this, so really that's the thing I need is that phone number.
[00:25:41.680 --> 00:25:43.480]   >> But Lisa got an iPhone 13, right?
[00:25:43.480 --> 00:25:45.280]   >> Yeah, so there's one in the family.
[00:25:45.280 --> 00:25:46.920]   You know what, by the way, she's loving it.
[00:25:46.920 --> 00:25:50.400]   She says, oh, it's so much faster, so much more reliable.
[00:25:50.400 --> 00:25:51.400]   She's very happy.
[00:25:51.400 --> 00:25:52.400]   >> Kind of so good.
[00:25:52.400 --> 00:25:56.320]   >> Her pictures are really, she's been taking pictures and they are really gorgeous.
[00:25:56.320 --> 00:26:00.000]   >> I'll let's see, my Instagram is now absolute seven out of 10 pictures of my Instagram are
[00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:03.360]   now like macro photos of random things that are for somebody's desk.
[00:26:03.360 --> 00:26:06.480]   But after they fired up their iPhone, it is actually quite majestic.
[00:26:06.480 --> 00:26:10.560]   >> All right, I got team set up.
[00:26:10.560 --> 00:26:12.840]   People can find you on teams by your phone number.
[00:26:12.840 --> 00:26:19.760]   >> Sync, I don't know if this will ring my phone or I gave it my Google voice number
[00:26:19.760 --> 00:26:21.680]   talking about it confusing.
[00:26:21.680 --> 00:26:24.400]   >> I don't know.
[00:26:24.400 --> 00:26:26.920]   I'm crossing the, I definitely am crossing the streams.
[00:26:26.920 --> 00:26:29.120]   This is not good.
[00:26:29.120 --> 00:26:30.120]   Anything else to say about them?
[00:26:30.120 --> 00:26:34.160]   Okay, I'll tell you a couple of things I like about the mini type C charging.
[00:26:34.160 --> 00:26:35.160]   >> Yeah.
[00:26:35.160 --> 00:26:37.560]   >> Type C charging and data.
[00:26:37.560 --> 00:26:42.120]   It's like basically this is the mini pro, isn't it?
[00:26:42.120 --> 00:26:43.120]   >> I mean, really.
[00:26:43.120 --> 00:26:44.800]   >> I was wrong last time.
[00:26:44.800 --> 00:26:48.040]   Alex has calculations because it's not three gigabytes per minute.
[00:26:48.040 --> 00:26:51.200]   It's six gigabytes per minute for ProRes and I have no idea what I'm going to do with
[00:26:51.200 --> 00:26:52.200]   that over lightning.
[00:26:52.200 --> 00:26:53.640]   >> Oh my God.
[00:26:53.640 --> 00:26:55.720]   So that's not, that means it's not LT.
[00:26:55.720 --> 00:27:00.520]   >> If it's six gigabytes per minute.
[00:27:00.520 --> 00:27:02.480]   >> Pretends that's HDR ProRes.
[00:27:02.480 --> 00:27:05.080]   >> That sounds like HDR ProRes.
[00:27:05.080 --> 00:27:06.080]   That's HQ.
[00:27:06.080 --> 00:27:07.080]   >> Yeah.
[00:27:07.080 --> 00:27:08.080]   >> Holy come holy.
[00:27:08.080 --> 00:27:11.200]   >> If it's actually doing HQ, which would make, would make a lot of sense.
[00:27:11.200 --> 00:27:14.880]   That was kind of like, it's kind of bummer to do a Apple ProRes and not do HQ because
[00:27:14.880 --> 00:27:18.520]   HQ gives you 10 bit and 10 bit gives you HDR.
[00:27:18.520 --> 00:27:23.640]   You know, or the, and here's the thing is even if it's not doing HDR to start with, it
[00:27:23.640 --> 00:27:29.320]   is, it potentially can do HDR and you can even convert your SDR to HDR with some, you
[00:27:29.320 --> 00:27:32.120]   know, color grading because you've got the 10 bits there to work with.
[00:27:32.120 --> 00:27:35.040]   So it's not as good, but it can be stretched to that.
[00:27:35.040 --> 00:27:36.600]   And so it's a good start.
[00:27:36.600 --> 00:27:37.600]   HQ is much more interesting.
[00:27:37.600 --> 00:27:39.680]   It has, it's a lot of data though.
[00:27:39.680 --> 00:27:41.120]   So I mean, for your little phones.
[00:27:41.120 --> 00:27:42.120]   >> Little like, yes.
[00:27:42.120 --> 00:27:45.600]   >> I'm glad I got a terabyte on my phone because I was, I was, I haven't gotten it yet, but
[00:27:45.600 --> 00:27:50.520]   it's, I got the terabyte because I was like, you knew as soon as I saw ProRes, I was like,
[00:27:50.520 --> 00:27:51.520]   I need all, I need all.
[00:27:51.520 --> 00:27:53.520]   >> Three gigabytes a minute.
[00:27:53.520 --> 00:27:54.520]   >> Six gigabytes.
[00:27:54.520 --> 00:27:59.360]   >> Six gigabytes a minute means 1,800 gigabytes an hour.
[00:27:59.360 --> 00:28:00.360]   That's.
[00:28:00.360 --> 00:28:01.360]   >> Yeah, so you can't do an hour.
[00:28:01.360 --> 00:28:02.360]   >> You can't do an hour.
[00:28:02.360 --> 00:28:03.360]   >> No, but 1.8 terabytes.
[00:28:03.360 --> 00:28:07.080]   >> But remember like, we used to, when we used to, when we used to shoot movies with film,
[00:28:07.080 --> 00:28:09.120]   it was seven minutes of a reel.
[00:28:09.120 --> 00:28:11.560]   So, you know, seven minutes per mag.
[00:28:11.560 --> 00:28:12.560]   >> Just like that.
[00:28:12.560 --> 00:28:15.560]   >> So you would, you know, and, and, and when we were doing it for high speed, it was like
[00:28:15.560 --> 00:28:16.560]   seconds.
[00:28:16.560 --> 00:28:18.160]   You know, like, you know, it's a 240 frames a second.
[00:28:18.160 --> 00:28:22.280]   It was, it was like, you know, you, you get, you know, less than a minute, you know.
[00:28:22.280 --> 00:28:26.760]   So, so when you're thinking about making a movie, what it really does, if it's HQ, it
[00:28:26.760 --> 00:28:29.920]   really means the iPhone could actually shoot a movie.
[00:28:29.920 --> 00:28:34.320]   Like it, HQ, you're, you're now, like, you could shoot a real film on it.
[00:28:34.320 --> 00:28:36.840]   >> Well, Apple knows that because I don't know if you've noticed, but all the Apple
[00:28:36.840 --> 00:28:40.960]   ads for the iPhone are talking about shooting a movie.
[00:28:40.960 --> 00:28:44.720]   I mean, it was, it was kind of a joke until you put ProRes in there.
[00:28:44.720 --> 00:28:46.320]   You know, like it's, you know, like that, you know, not really.
[00:28:46.320 --> 00:28:47.320]   >> So not in there, is it?
[00:28:47.320 --> 00:28:49.080]   I mean, we're, we're waiting for that to be.
[00:28:49.080 --> 00:28:50.080]   >> Yeah, but wait.
[00:28:50.080 --> 00:28:51.080]   >> But when it happens.
[00:28:51.080 --> 00:28:52.080]   >> Is there a tough frame on that?
[00:28:52.080 --> 00:28:57.400]   >> I'm guessing it'll be the same as portrait mode and deep fusion and pro raw last, which
[00:28:57.400 --> 00:28:59.160]   is like towards October, November.
[00:28:59.160 --> 00:29:00.160]   >> Okay.
[00:29:00.160 --> 00:29:02.120]   >> That seems to be when they get the photo stuff out.
[00:29:02.120 --> 00:29:04.960]   >> What is, what is the delay about?
[00:29:04.960 --> 00:29:06.720]   >> It's just, it's time.
[00:29:06.720 --> 00:29:09.560]   Like, and Tyler Stalman is a really good Canadian photographer.
[00:29:09.560 --> 00:29:13.600]   He had Cheyenne Drans and John McCormick, and I'm blanking on Greg's last name, but he
[00:29:13.600 --> 00:29:17.320]   had basically Apple's head of iPhone marketing, Apple's head of camera software and Apple's
[00:29:17.320 --> 00:29:20.760]   head of camera hardware on his podcast yesterday.
[00:29:20.760 --> 00:29:25.480]   And they explained in like amazing detail all the stuff they're doing, including HDR
[00:29:25.480 --> 00:29:28.400]   4 is now on video as well as on camera.
[00:29:28.400 --> 00:29:32.680]   So it's not just doing all the semantic rendering on a single photo.
[00:29:32.680 --> 00:29:37.040]   It's doing it on every frame of video as it goes through the pipeline.
[00:29:37.040 --> 00:29:40.240]   And they've been working three years out on every camera.
[00:29:40.240 --> 00:29:41.240]   So and every chipset.
[00:29:41.240 --> 00:29:43.920]   So everything we see now is what they started working on three years ago.
[00:29:43.920 --> 00:29:44.920]   It's a really cool deal.
[00:29:44.920 --> 00:29:46.480]   >> I don't mean to sound ungrateful.
[00:29:46.480 --> 00:29:47.480]   I'm just asking.
[00:29:47.480 --> 00:29:48.480]   I'm not right.
[00:29:48.480 --> 00:29:50.040]   I appreciate it that they're doing it.
[00:29:50.040 --> 00:29:53.240]   >> No, no, it's just they have to finish and get it shipped.
[00:29:53.240 --> 00:29:55.960]   And I think every year they overestimate how fast they can get it started.
[00:29:55.960 --> 00:30:02.520]   >> And Renee, do you know if it's six gigs per for HD or ultra HD?
[00:30:02.520 --> 00:30:03.520]   >> For 4K.
[00:30:03.520 --> 00:30:06.520]   It's 1.5 gigs for 1080p.
[00:30:06.520 --> 00:30:12.040]   >> Because there's no number that really hits that right on.
[00:30:12.040 --> 00:30:17.800]   So that's the interesting thing because it's like five Apple ProRes by itself, not HQ is
[00:30:17.800 --> 00:30:21.480]   five and Apple HQ is 7.43.
[00:30:21.480 --> 00:30:22.480]   So it might still be four.
[00:30:22.480 --> 00:30:24.520]   >> It was off the top of a non-camera person.
[00:30:24.520 --> 00:30:28.000]   So maybe they were just trying to remember what they were hearing, but I think it's probably
[00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:29.000]   ballpark.
[00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:35.760]   >> Yeah. If it was HQ at 2398, which they may be targeting, it's 594, 5.94.
[00:30:35.760 --> 00:30:37.560]   So that would be about right.
[00:30:37.560 --> 00:30:42.200]   So if they were doing 2398 at HQ, that would give us 10-bit video.
[00:30:42.200 --> 00:30:44.680]   It'd be really nifty.
[00:30:44.680 --> 00:30:47.000]   >> We do this math every show lately.
[00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:48.000]   >> I know.
[00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:49.000]   We're so excited.
[00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:50.000]   >> I actually put it.
[00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:52.000]   >> Math break weekly continues.
[00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:58.440]   USB-C is important because, well, for a couple of reasons.
[00:30:58.440 --> 00:31:04.800]   By the way, the way the speakers are configured with four, two on each side, the way the square
[00:31:04.800 --> 00:31:12.640]   sides are, the fact that it has a 15 chip at the very, very latest chip in it.
[00:31:12.640 --> 00:31:16.760]   The only thing missing is, I would say, massive storage and massive RAM.
[00:31:16.760 --> 00:31:17.760]   >> Absolutely.
[00:31:17.760 --> 00:31:19.560]   >> But otherwise, this is a Pro, right?
[00:31:19.560 --> 00:31:20.560]   A mini Pro?
[00:31:20.560 --> 00:31:21.560]   >> Absolutely.
[00:31:21.560 --> 00:31:25.080]   That was one of the few things that I wouldn't say that I didn't like about it, but I thought
[00:31:25.080 --> 00:31:29.360]   that I wish that they found a way to make this less expensive.
[00:31:29.360 --> 00:31:31.160]   It really is an iPad mini Pro.
[00:31:31.160 --> 00:31:36.280]   It really is the sort of thing where if you need this device to deliver for you in your
[00:31:36.280 --> 00:31:41.240]   pocket, meaning that you don't just want to, yes, you'll read Kindle books, yes, you'll
[00:31:41.240 --> 00:31:44.880]   read your email, maybe you'll write a couple of memos or stuff like that, but you also
[00:31:44.880 --> 00:31:48.520]   maybe want to actually do real productive work, that's great.
[00:31:48.520 --> 00:31:53.520]   But it kind of bums me out that it's $500 for 64 gigs of RAM, which at which, excuse
[00:31:53.520 --> 00:31:58.320]   me, of storage, at which point, that really is just a basic consumption device.
[00:31:58.320 --> 00:32:02.680]   You really want to add more storage to make it more useful to take advantage of that CPU.
[00:32:02.680 --> 00:32:06.320]   And by the time you do that, you really are kind of up there and you're starting to think,
[00:32:06.320 --> 00:32:10.560]   I know that I'm interested in this mini because of its form factor, but now that we're at
[00:32:10.560 --> 00:32:15.080]   $800, let's look at other solutions to see if I'm not wasting my money on something that
[00:32:15.080 --> 00:32:16.080]   is just cool.
[00:32:16.080 --> 00:32:18.080]   >> And have you listened to it?
[00:32:18.080 --> 00:32:21.160]   >> I think there's a market for the mini as a pro.
[00:32:21.160 --> 00:32:26.080]   So it's basically the MacBook Air, sorry, the iPad Air shrunk down minus $100 and they
[00:32:26.080 --> 00:32:29.720]   think that that's where they'll get the most sales and if they go to the full on pro,
[00:32:29.720 --> 00:32:33.240]   the price will get to a point where people will just not buy enough of them to sustain
[00:32:33.240 --> 00:32:34.240]   it.
[00:32:34.240 --> 00:32:40.400]   >> Have you watched anything that's around, like watched a movie with immersive audio,
[00:32:40.400 --> 00:32:42.360]   like any kind of app that's on that?
[00:32:42.360 --> 00:32:43.360]   >> Spatial audio.
[00:32:43.360 --> 00:32:44.360]   >> That little one.
[00:32:44.360 --> 00:32:45.360]   Spatial audio is incredible.
[00:32:45.360 --> 00:32:47.520]   You know, I feel all the iPads.
[00:32:47.520 --> 00:32:49.680]   Like it doesn't make any sense.
[00:32:49.680 --> 00:32:53.000]   You're like, I don't understand why this sounds like it's all around you and you can
[00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:56.440]   hear it all in the math and there is like crazy math.
[00:32:56.440 --> 00:32:59.640]   >> That's why I love having these four speakers and I presume this is the same thing when
[00:32:59.640 --> 00:33:02.040]   you rotate it and all that.
[00:33:02.040 --> 00:33:03.440]   >> Not the same as the pro.
[00:33:03.440 --> 00:33:05.320]   The pro will actually go in all four directions.
[00:33:05.320 --> 00:33:07.320]   This one is mostly for landscape.
[00:33:07.320 --> 00:33:09.160]   >> Interesting, okay.
[00:33:09.160 --> 00:33:11.120]   >> The pro has four separate speakers just to do that.
[00:33:11.120 --> 00:33:13.120]   This one has two speakers there.
[00:33:13.120 --> 00:33:15.760]   They're meant so that they have two sides so that if you're holding it in a certain way,
[00:33:15.760 --> 00:33:16.760]   you're not blocking the speakers.
[00:33:16.760 --> 00:33:19.360]   They want to make it easy for you not to block your own spike speakers.
[00:33:19.360 --> 00:33:20.360]   >> Okay.
[00:33:20.360 --> 00:33:22.520]   Anyway, I'm very happy.
[00:33:22.520 --> 00:33:26.840]   I mean, I think this is in every respect to really a good choice of somebody's looking
[00:33:26.840 --> 00:33:28.120]   for an iPad.
[00:33:28.120 --> 00:33:29.120]   They want--
[00:33:29.120 --> 00:33:30.120]   >> Absolutely.
[00:33:30.120 --> 00:33:31.120]   >> It's a really cool thing, Leo.
[00:33:31.120 --> 00:33:34.720]   If the volume buttons as you rotate it, the top and bottom volume will shift depending on
[00:33:34.720 --> 00:33:38.720]   the orientation so that whatever you think is volume up will still be volume up.
[00:33:38.720 --> 00:33:40.880]   >> Oh my God, I didn't notice that.
[00:33:40.880 --> 00:33:43.560]   That would be confusing for me because I don't expect that.
[00:33:43.560 --> 00:33:44.760]   >> I don't even think about it though.
[00:33:44.760 --> 00:33:45.760]   That's it.
[00:33:45.760 --> 00:33:48.480]   Like, if everyone is on top is up.
[00:33:48.480 --> 00:33:49.480]   >> That's amazing.
[00:33:49.480 --> 00:33:54.440]   All right, well, they've definitely done a good job.
[00:33:54.440 --> 00:33:59.520]   So somebody in the chat room is saying if I use--he has been using his mini for a phone
[00:33:59.520 --> 00:34:05.680]   for some time using a service called Talk-A-Tone, which I'm not completely familiar with, but
[00:34:05.680 --> 00:34:08.920]   I'm setting up my Talk-A-Tone account right now.
[00:34:08.920 --> 00:34:12.280]   >> Now, teams has your number of Talk-A-Tone.
[00:34:12.280 --> 00:34:13.960]   Everyone in the chat room is going to be calling you, Leo.
[00:34:13.960 --> 00:34:17.400]   Talk-A-Tone gives you a phone number for free.
[00:34:17.400 --> 00:34:18.400]   >> Everybody.
[00:34:18.400 --> 00:34:23.560]   See, this is why you spend that amount of money to become a part of the most material
[00:34:23.560 --> 00:34:27.160]   because you get to make Leo dance like a monkey right on the show.
[00:34:27.160 --> 00:34:29.240]   >> You get Leo's phone number and you ask him for it.
[00:34:29.240 --> 00:34:30.240]   >> I did it.
[00:34:30.240 --> 00:34:31.240]   I did it.
[00:34:31.240 --> 00:34:33.280]   >> I'm going to see if I call myself.
[00:34:33.280 --> 00:34:34.280]   Okay.
[00:34:34.280 --> 00:34:35.280]   Okay.
[00:34:35.280 --> 00:34:36.440]   I got a number.
[00:34:36.440 --> 00:34:38.520]   Now what do I do?
[00:34:38.520 --> 00:34:40.680]   I'm going to do a 911.
[00:34:40.680 --> 00:34:42.920]   You're acknowledging does not support 911.
[00:34:42.920 --> 00:34:47.360]   Well, of course, allow notifications, allow contact.
[00:34:47.360 --> 00:34:48.920]   >> You said, of course, now, Leo.
[00:34:48.920 --> 00:34:49.920]   So casually.
[00:34:49.920 --> 00:34:50.920]   >> Of course.
[00:34:50.920 --> 00:34:51.920]   Talk-A-Tone wants to stay free for you.
[00:34:51.920 --> 00:34:52.920]   Oh, this is interesting.
[00:34:52.920 --> 00:34:56.520]   Actually, I'm going to get to this subject in a second.
[00:34:56.520 --> 00:34:58.360]   Ads help support a business tap.
[00:34:58.360 --> 00:35:00.880]   Allow tracking on the next screen to get permission.
[00:35:00.880 --> 00:35:03.360]   This is in response to the Apple.
[00:35:03.360 --> 00:35:05.800]   Do you want this app to track you?
[00:35:05.800 --> 00:35:07.280]   I guess I'm going to allow it because--
[00:35:07.280 --> 00:35:08.920]   >> I would love it.
[00:35:08.920 --> 00:35:10.040]   >> I want it to free phone number.
[00:35:10.040 --> 00:35:12.240]   But also, you know, that's upfront.
[00:35:12.240 --> 00:35:13.240]   That's explaining.
[00:35:13.240 --> 00:35:14.240]   There's a reason we have ads.
[00:35:14.240 --> 00:35:15.240]   >> You can do that?
[00:35:15.240 --> 00:35:16.240]   I was afraid to ask.
[00:35:16.240 --> 00:35:17.240]   >> Wow.
[00:35:17.240 --> 00:35:18.240]   >> I want it to feel selfish.
[00:35:18.240 --> 00:35:20.840]   I mean, this isn't all about me app.
[00:35:20.840 --> 00:35:22.320]   You don't have to track me.
[00:35:22.320 --> 00:35:24.720]   But if you're going to anyway, oh my God, that's kind of flattering.
[00:35:24.720 --> 00:35:27.560]   >> I guess I could pay-- and then you could pay for ad-free.
[00:35:27.560 --> 00:35:30.120]   But a phone number costs some money, so--
[00:35:30.120 --> 00:35:31.120]   >> Right.
[00:35:31.120 --> 00:35:33.400]   >> They're not doing that yourself, Sam.
[00:35:33.400 --> 00:35:35.120]   >> Yeah, that's ironic.
[00:35:35.120 --> 00:35:37.120]   The ad I'm getting is for Mint Mobile, so--
[00:35:37.120 --> 00:35:38.120]   >> [LAUGH]
[00:35:38.120 --> 00:35:40.240]   >> When Reynolds is everywhere.
[00:35:40.240 --> 00:35:42.520]   >> It all works out just fine.
[00:35:42.520 --> 00:35:43.520]   So good.
[00:35:43.520 --> 00:35:44.880]   I'll give this talk a try.
[00:35:44.880 --> 00:35:45.880]   Thank you.
[00:35:45.880 --> 00:35:49.040]   Web 9701 for that suggestion.
[00:35:49.040 --> 00:35:53.960]   I guess the real thing is if it'll ring in the background, right?
[00:35:53.960 --> 00:35:57.120]   That's-- so like I could give out this number and it would be my phone.
[00:35:57.120 --> 00:35:58.120]   >> It should.
[00:35:58.120 --> 00:36:01.520]   I mean, as long as the notifications are running, the notification system, the local one should
[00:36:01.520 --> 00:36:02.520]   have--
[00:36:02.520 --> 00:36:06.160]   so as long as you don't kill it manually, you can close it.
[00:36:06.160 --> 00:36:07.160]   >> Yeah, we're trying to put notifications.
[00:36:07.160 --> 00:36:09.880]   >> Yeah, no, and I allowed notifications.
[00:36:09.880 --> 00:36:11.280]   Huh, very interesting.
[00:36:11.280 --> 00:36:12.280]   Good.
[00:36:12.280 --> 00:36:15.280]   I don't mean-- make me to make this all about me, but it is.
[00:36:15.280 --> 00:36:19.760]   >> No, no, but it's an interesting pathway because this is a situation that I think a
[00:36:19.760 --> 00:36:20.760]   lot of us are going through where--
[00:36:20.760 --> 00:36:22.640]   >> Yeah, what do I need a phone for?
[00:36:22.640 --> 00:36:23.640]   >> Yeah, exactly.
[00:36:23.640 --> 00:36:27.200]   Where-- and it really is just for that one little edge case where the best way to get
[00:36:27.200 --> 00:36:29.680]   in touch with me reliably is a phone number.
[00:36:29.680 --> 00:36:33.080]   But otherwise, I could take this entire extra device and leave it at home and just use this
[00:36:33.080 --> 00:36:34.080]   one device.
[00:36:34.080 --> 00:36:36.000]   >> Yeah, very cool.
[00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:41.960]   Actually, the EU-- this is the story I was going to with this-- looks like it's about
[00:36:41.960 --> 00:36:50.360]   to require one mobile charging port for all, Type C. And of course, Apple's arguing strongly
[00:36:50.360 --> 00:36:52.800]   against this Thursday--
[00:36:52.800 --> 00:36:53.800]   >> Who's-- who's--
[00:36:53.800 --> 00:36:54.800]   >> Pardon me?
[00:36:54.800 --> 00:36:55.800]   >> Sorry, go ahead.
[00:36:55.800 --> 00:36:56.800]   I didn't interrupt you.
[00:36:56.800 --> 00:36:59.600]   >> It was there-- it was that line they said where-- if Apple wants more than one,
[00:36:59.600 --> 00:37:01.440]   if Apple wants to use lightning, they still can.
[00:37:01.440 --> 00:37:02.760]   They can just put two ports at the bottom.
[00:37:02.760 --> 00:37:03.760]   I thought that was--
[00:37:03.760 --> 00:37:05.920]   >> Oh, there you go.
[00:37:05.920 --> 00:37:06.920]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:37:06.920 --> 00:37:11.720]   >> Really, at this point, lightning is just a proprietary port.
[00:37:11.720 --> 00:37:13.720]   The fact that they put Type C on this mini--
[00:37:13.720 --> 00:37:14.720]   >> Well, the thing is--
[00:37:14.720 --> 00:37:20.560]   >> To be honest, lightning is just-- lightning is just there because Apple's next step for
[00:37:20.560 --> 00:37:22.920]   the iPhone is to remove all ports entirely.
[00:37:22.920 --> 00:37:26.560]   And they don't want to do all the engineering for USB-C just for something that they're just
[00:37:26.560 --> 00:37:27.560]   going to have for two years.
[00:37:27.560 --> 00:37:31.800]   So that's why they're fighting, not because they don't think it's-- they-- oh, this is
[00:37:31.800 --> 00:37:34.400]   why I sometimes get off on a rent and I will knock it off on a rent here.
[00:37:34.400 --> 00:37:38.680]   But they're not going to say-- do the honest thing and simply say, look, we have engineering
[00:37:38.680 --> 00:37:41.480]   goals that do not include heavy USB-C port.
[00:37:41.480 --> 00:37:44.720]   We can't-- we're not going to tell you exactly what our plans are, but they don't fit into
[00:37:44.720 --> 00:37:45.720]   our plans.
[00:37:45.720 --> 00:37:49.040]   And said they're saying, we feel as though we're stifling innovation here.
[00:37:49.040 --> 00:37:52.680]   And because we all we care about is our users, it's like, no, it's so Apple, it's okay to
[00:37:52.680 --> 00:37:54.800]   say we were a couple trillion dollar company.
[00:37:54.800 --> 00:37:58.760]   We got that way by making our users happy and making decisions that we think for our product
[00:37:58.760 --> 00:38:00.080]   line work out well.
[00:38:00.080 --> 00:38:03.560]   Just don't say that it's-- gosh, we're going to throw ourselves bodily in front of this
[00:38:03.560 --> 00:38:07.040]   hail of tomatoes that the EU was trying to throw at our other users.
[00:38:07.040 --> 00:38:08.040]   That's all I'm saying.
[00:38:08.040 --> 00:38:10.880]   I mean, fundamentally, that USB-C is a horribly flawed platform.
[00:38:10.880 --> 00:38:13.800]   Like it is-- it is just a-- so the problem is that it exists.
[00:38:13.800 --> 00:38:15.520]   It's fine that we use it.
[00:38:15.520 --> 00:38:18.120]   It's a good enough platform for most things and it's fine.
[00:38:18.120 --> 00:38:19.440]   But it's horribly flawed.
[00:38:19.440 --> 00:38:20.440]   Like I have to trust--
[00:38:20.440 --> 00:38:21.440]   How is it a flog?
[00:38:21.440 --> 00:38:22.440]   How is it a flog?
[00:38:22.440 --> 00:38:24.760]   Every time I pick up a cable, I don't know what it's going to do.
[00:38:24.760 --> 00:38:25.760]   Well, that's right.
[00:38:25.760 --> 00:38:28.320]   No idea whether that-- it's going to pass data.
[00:38:28.320 --> 00:38:29.320]   Is it going to pass power?
[00:38:29.320 --> 00:38:30.320]   Is it going to do anything else?
[00:38:30.320 --> 00:38:32.680]   Like it is a complete chaos.
[00:38:32.680 --> 00:38:35.880]   And so it is the dumbest-- it was so badly designed.
[00:38:35.880 --> 00:38:39.360]   It was designed by committee and just totally trashed.
[00:38:39.360 --> 00:38:42.120]   And so the problem is that it's fine.
[00:38:42.120 --> 00:38:44.160]   I don't have a problem with the format.
[00:38:44.160 --> 00:38:47.040]   I'm happy that we have something better than USB-C.
[00:38:47.040 --> 00:38:49.520]   I'm not a USB-C, but USB-C, whatever the last one was--
[00:38:49.520 --> 00:38:51.600]   Micro, which was worse than--
[00:38:51.600 --> 00:38:55.320]   Which is what they wanted to standardize on before,
[00:38:55.320 --> 00:38:56.720]   which was a disaster.
[00:38:56.720 --> 00:38:59.120]   And so number one is they haven't finalized it.
[00:38:59.120 --> 00:38:59.880]   They've talked about it.
[00:38:59.880 --> 00:39:02.640]   Number two is that this is a perfect example
[00:39:02.640 --> 00:39:04.160]   of what the government should not do,
[00:39:04.160 --> 00:39:07.800]   because they're standardizing on a flawed format already.
[00:39:07.800 --> 00:39:08.880]   We already know it's flawed.
[00:39:08.880 --> 00:39:10.800]   It might be flawed someday.
[00:39:10.800 --> 00:39:11.960]   It's not even a new form.
[00:39:11.960 --> 00:39:13.240]   It's old and flawed.
[00:39:13.240 --> 00:39:18.440]   And so in addition to that, making a charger
[00:39:18.440 --> 00:39:20.400]   is different than passing data.
[00:39:20.400 --> 00:39:22.160]   So Apple doesn't need to necessarily--
[00:39:22.160 --> 00:39:23.560]   they can make a charge-- they can say, well,
[00:39:23.560 --> 00:39:25.360]   you can charge the phone with it.
[00:39:25.360 --> 00:39:28.440]   But we're going to do data with three little things
[00:39:28.440 --> 00:39:30.960]   on the back of it or whatever they want to do.
[00:39:30.960 --> 00:39:33.400]   They don't have to put data through that charger.
[00:39:33.400 --> 00:39:36.760]   And so the thing is there's a lot of-- but it is to Andy's point.
[00:39:36.760 --> 00:39:40.240]   It's that Apple's getting rid of the connection altogether.
[00:39:40.240 --> 00:39:41.720]   They're just not doing it in two years.
[00:39:41.720 --> 00:39:43.440]   They're probably doing it in three or four years.
[00:39:43.440 --> 00:39:45.400]   So Alex, that's the whole thing for me,
[00:39:45.400 --> 00:39:48.040]   is that Apple made lightning three years
[00:39:48.040 --> 00:39:49.560]   before they could finalize USB-C.
[00:39:49.560 --> 00:39:51.040]   It was the same team working on it.
[00:39:51.040 --> 00:39:53.640]   And this would have-- if they had made USB-A standard back,
[00:39:53.640 --> 00:39:55.600]   then we wouldn't have gotten the iPhone 5, at least not
[00:39:55.600 --> 00:39:57.120]   in a format recognizable to us.
[00:39:57.120 --> 00:40:00.280]   Because USB-A would not have fit in an iPhone 5.
[00:40:00.280 --> 00:40:02.160]   And there's plenty of proprietary chargers, too,
[00:40:02.160 --> 00:40:03.320]   that look like USB-C.
[00:40:03.320 --> 00:40:05.600]   But there is some that if you lose your--
[00:40:05.600 --> 00:40:06.680]   I forget which companies do it.
[00:40:06.680 --> 00:40:07.280]   It's not OnePlus.
[00:40:07.280 --> 00:40:10.040]   But if you lose that charger, you can go get a USB-C charger.
[00:40:10.040 --> 00:40:12.680]   But you lose all your fast charge, warp charge, super charge
[00:40:12.680 --> 00:40:13.360]   capabilities.
[00:40:13.360 --> 00:40:14.520]   Sometimes you lower down.
[00:40:14.520 --> 00:40:17.520]   Sometimes you don't have any of that anymore.
[00:40:17.520 --> 00:40:19.720]   And the cables are wildly inconsistent.
[00:40:19.720 --> 00:40:21.720]   There are a lot of them manufactured poorly.
[00:40:21.720 --> 00:40:23.320]   They have so many different capabilities
[00:40:23.320 --> 00:40:26.120]   in terms of power delivery at what waters they deliver power.
[00:40:26.120 --> 00:40:29.400]   Data throughput at what speeds they can deliver data.
[00:40:29.400 --> 00:40:31.000]   And I just don't like the idea of the people who gave us
[00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:32.520]   the browser ballot.
[00:40:32.520 --> 00:40:33.800]   And I forget about the other one that they've
[00:40:33.800 --> 00:40:36.520]   had a couple of sterling examples of technological obliviousness
[00:40:36.520 --> 00:40:37.800]   over the years.
[00:40:37.800 --> 00:40:40.840]   Maybe Qualcomm, or maybe Samsung, or maybe even Apple
[00:40:40.840 --> 00:40:45.320]   comes up with this amazing connector in two years from now.
[00:40:45.320 --> 00:40:46.200]   And what are you supposed to do?
[00:40:46.200 --> 00:40:48.120]   Have two ports at the bottom.
[00:40:48.120 --> 00:40:49.560]   Apple should just put USB-C in.
[00:40:49.560 --> 00:40:51.840]   But if you'd be Apple, just put a USB-C in.
[00:40:51.840 --> 00:40:53.520]   So that's the question.
[00:40:53.520 --> 00:40:58.480]   How soon is the EU directive going to happen?
[00:40:58.480 --> 00:41:00.480]   And how soon will Apple be ready?
[00:41:00.480 --> 00:41:02.720]   And by the way, for people who are getting terrified when
[00:41:02.720 --> 00:41:05.160]   we say a portless iPhone, we're thinking
[00:41:05.160 --> 00:41:08.880]   a smart connector on the back that there'll be a solution.
[00:41:08.880 --> 00:41:11.160]   Will A, will that satisfy the EU and B?
[00:41:11.160 --> 00:41:15.000]   Will the timeframes match?
[00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:19.120]   If Apple's three years off, I think he's going to do it soon.
[00:41:19.120 --> 00:41:20.280]   If they're not governing--
[00:41:20.280 --> 00:41:21.600]   They're not governing non-quotes.
[00:41:21.600 --> 00:41:22.800]   As far as they can tell.
[00:41:22.800 --> 00:41:24.800]   Wireless wireless charging is exempt from this.
[00:41:24.800 --> 00:41:28.120]   Also, if previous proposals and actions from the EU
[00:41:28.120 --> 00:41:30.680]   are consistent, then what they would do is that say, yes,
[00:41:30.680 --> 00:41:32.480]   you can have your little three-point dongle--
[00:41:32.480 --> 00:41:34.320]   excuse me, a pogo pugs on the back.
[00:41:34.320 --> 00:41:36.600]   But you're going to have to include inside the box a way
[00:41:36.600 --> 00:41:40.720]   that people can charge via USB-C through those three--
[00:41:40.720 --> 00:41:42.240]   you'll have to include the dongle adapter
[00:41:42.240 --> 00:41:43.080]   for them to make that work.
[00:41:43.080 --> 00:41:44.120]   That should be great.
[00:41:44.120 --> 00:41:46.040]   I'd love that.
[00:41:46.040 --> 00:41:48.640]   Make them include all the dongles.
[00:41:48.640 --> 00:41:49.680]   For Apple, oh my god.
[00:41:49.680 --> 00:41:50.880]   You must be dongles for Apple.
[00:41:50.880 --> 00:41:52.680]   You want to bring Apple down to its knees.
[00:41:52.680 --> 00:41:54.120]   Suddenly you're responsible for every dongle
[00:41:54.120 --> 00:41:55.720]   that every Apple user needs for everything.
[00:41:55.720 --> 00:41:58.240]   No, but people argue about Apple wrong.
[00:41:58.240 --> 00:42:00.640]   And it frustrates me because it lets them off the hook.
[00:42:00.640 --> 00:42:02.840]   When Apple switched to USB-C on MacBooks,
[00:42:02.840 --> 00:42:04.040]   everyone's like, oh, great.
[00:42:04.040 --> 00:42:07.040]   Now you can't plug your new iPhone into your new MacBook.
[00:42:07.040 --> 00:42:08.040]   There's a different plug.
[00:42:08.040 --> 00:42:12.000]   But 90% of iPhone customers are on PCs with USB-A cables.
[00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:13.120]   So that's what the cable was.
[00:42:13.120 --> 00:42:14.800]   But the argument was, why didn't you
[00:42:14.800 --> 00:42:16.920]   put an adapter in the box?
[00:42:16.920 --> 00:42:18.320]   That's just what you should do.
[00:42:18.320 --> 00:42:20.760]   They did with the 3.5 millimeter headphone jack
[00:42:20.760 --> 00:42:22.720]   for all of one year.
[00:42:22.720 --> 00:42:25.200]   There should be a two-year or a three-year mandate.
[00:42:25.200 --> 00:42:27.320]   Whenever you change something, you include an adapter
[00:42:27.320 --> 00:42:29.640]   in the box for the thing that you changed it from.
[00:42:29.640 --> 00:42:33.360]   So the EU says-- and Apple says this is too short.
[00:42:33.360 --> 00:42:36.160]   There's a two-year transition period.
[00:42:36.160 --> 00:42:39.280]   So Apple, I guess your three-year time frame makes sense
[00:42:39.280 --> 00:42:42.720]   in Alex.
[00:42:42.720 --> 00:42:44.040]   Right.
[00:42:44.040 --> 00:42:45.640]   It's not a trivial thing.
[00:42:45.640 --> 00:42:48.160]   And I'm talking about simply cutting the hole
[00:42:48.160 --> 00:42:49.680]   in the side of the thing and making room
[00:42:49.680 --> 00:42:52.000]   for a different set of electronics you did not anticipate.
[00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:54.880]   A two-year time frame is not a lot.
[00:42:54.880 --> 00:42:57.160]   The number that I keep hearing bandied about engineers
[00:42:57.160 --> 00:43:01.040]   is that from Go, it takes about three years to ship a phone.
[00:43:01.040 --> 00:43:02.760]   So they would have to get on their way.
[00:43:02.760 --> 00:43:05.400]   Let's be fair, this has been in the making for 10 years,
[00:43:05.400 --> 00:43:06.640]   according to Reuters.
[00:43:06.640 --> 00:43:08.560]   So it's not a surprise.
[00:43:08.560 --> 00:43:09.560]   True.
[00:43:09.560 --> 00:43:10.440]   They probably have--
[00:43:10.440 --> 00:43:12.000]   They probably have--
[00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:12.840]   Sorry, go ahead.
[00:43:12.840 --> 00:43:13.840]   I'm sorry.
[00:43:13.840 --> 00:43:15.640]   I was going to say it's 10 years from--
[00:43:15.640 --> 00:43:17.840]   what was the firewire to dock?
[00:43:17.840 --> 00:43:19.920]   It was 10 years of dock, and then next year
[00:43:19.920 --> 00:43:21.120]   is going to be 10 years of lightning.
[00:43:21.120 --> 00:43:22.920]   Well, OK.
[00:43:22.920 --> 00:43:26.480]   I think the other question is that in two years,
[00:43:26.480 --> 00:43:28.840]   does Apple have the juice to just say, hey, we can't sell
[00:43:28.840 --> 00:43:29.840]   in the EU?
[00:43:29.840 --> 00:43:30.840]   No.
[00:43:30.840 --> 00:43:32.040]   It's 23% of that.
[00:43:32.040 --> 00:43:33.040]   It's 23% of that.
[00:43:33.040 --> 00:43:35.040]   It's 23% of that.
[00:43:35.040 --> 00:43:38.120]   And probably 75% of the people would just buy--
[00:43:38.120 --> 00:43:41.520]   Yeah, to Renee's point, they wouldn't even do that in Russia,
[00:43:41.520 --> 00:43:46.840]   where they really should say to Russia, no, get out of our cheese.
[00:43:46.840 --> 00:43:48.120]   But they won't, even though Russia's
[00:43:48.120 --> 00:43:51.240]   got to be a tiny market from Apple's point of view.
[00:43:51.240 --> 00:43:52.480]   So EU is a big market.
[00:43:52.480 --> 00:43:53.000]   So many years ago.
[00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:54.600]   23% is not insignificant.
[00:43:54.600 --> 00:43:56.200]   Apple's not going to walk away from the EU.
[00:43:56.200 --> 00:43:59.520]   It's not dimension that would look terrible, especially
[00:43:59.520 --> 00:44:02.680]   since I would say most consumers say, yeah, that's a great idea.
[00:44:02.680 --> 00:44:03.640]   Make everything type C.
[00:44:03.640 --> 00:44:05.120]   Well, that's environmentalist theater.
[00:44:05.120 --> 00:44:07.360]   They don't want to make any big decisions about Shell.
[00:44:07.360 --> 00:44:08.840]   Like, god forbid, they go after Shell.
[00:44:08.840 --> 00:44:09.800]   They go after lightning cable.
[00:44:09.800 --> 00:44:10.960]   But they should do that too.
[00:44:10.960 --> 00:44:12.760]   That helps such a small amount compared
[00:44:12.760 --> 00:44:15.040]   to the stuff they don't want to go anywhere near.
[00:44:15.040 --> 00:44:16.280]   It doesn't help at all.
[00:44:16.280 --> 00:44:18.040]   It's completely-- I mean, it's not going to help.
[00:44:18.040 --> 00:44:20.520]   OK, but it still should happen.
[00:44:20.520 --> 00:44:21.720]   You're not arguing against it.
[00:44:21.720 --> 00:44:23.960]   Are you-- Type C is a better way to go than lightning?
[00:44:23.960 --> 00:44:24.960]   It's a flawed format.
[00:44:24.960 --> 00:44:26.360]   They should be no one to be forced to do.
[00:44:26.360 --> 00:44:27.160]   It's not a flawed format.
[00:44:27.160 --> 00:44:28.680]   It's a charger that everything uses.
[00:44:28.680 --> 00:44:31.120]   Everything I have except for Apple's gear now.
[00:44:31.120 --> 00:44:34.160]   Every single thing I have, types charges with Type C.
[00:44:34.160 --> 00:44:35.880]   And can I back you up Leo by saying that?
[00:44:35.880 --> 00:44:36.960]   Who is it at the time?
[00:44:36.960 --> 00:44:40.240]   I've been mentioning on the show before that it's a pos--
[00:44:40.240 --> 00:44:42.240]   I'm kind of-- this fall, I'll probably
[00:44:42.240 --> 00:44:44.800]   be making a decision between buying either an iPhone 13
[00:44:44.800 --> 00:44:47.040]   Pro or a Pixel 6.
[00:44:47.040 --> 00:44:49.680]   Because both of the Pixel 6 is going to be a big, big upgrade.
[00:44:49.680 --> 00:44:54.120]   And the iPhone 13 looks like just a beautiful refinement
[00:44:54.120 --> 00:44:55.920]   of like 10 years of development.
[00:44:55.920 --> 00:44:57.920]   But I was doing some more thinking about it last week.
[00:44:57.920 --> 00:45:00.520]   And I realized that if it's anything like close,
[00:45:00.520 --> 00:45:02.920]   the fact that the Pixel has USB-C,
[00:45:02.920 --> 00:45:05.120]   and I would have to be carrying around lightning cables
[00:45:05.120 --> 00:45:07.720]   just for this one iPhone, would probably
[00:45:07.720 --> 00:45:09.480]   tip the scales in favor of Pixel for me.
[00:45:09.480 --> 00:45:11.800]   Again, if it were anything like close,
[00:45:11.800 --> 00:45:14.320]   then the USB would win the day for me.
[00:45:14.320 --> 00:45:16.040]   And I agree with what you're saying,
[00:45:16.040 --> 00:45:18.200]   Alex, about it being a confusing format.
[00:45:18.200 --> 00:45:20.080]   But charging is not confusing.
[00:45:20.080 --> 00:45:23.880]   Every Type C cable, at least as charging, everything I have,
[00:45:23.880 --> 00:45:26.800]   uses Type C. This makes perfect sense.
[00:45:26.800 --> 00:45:28.280]   Don't we even celebrate it?
[00:45:28.280 --> 00:45:29.160]   Wasn't I happy?
[00:45:29.160 --> 00:45:32.320]   Weren't you happy when I said, oh, the mini, it's got Type C.
[00:45:32.320 --> 00:45:34.440]   That's a good thing.
[00:45:34.440 --> 00:45:37.520]   I just think that it's just a government overreach
[00:45:37.520 --> 00:45:40.560]   to force something that is already broken.
[00:45:40.560 --> 00:45:41.760]   It's already broken.
[00:45:41.760 --> 00:45:44.080]   I'm not saying that there's anything wrong with Type C
[00:45:44.080 --> 00:45:46.760]   that shouldn't exist or that it's whatever.
[00:45:46.760 --> 00:45:49.920]   I'm just saying that to justify saying
[00:45:49.920 --> 00:45:52.360]   that everybody has to do the same thing,
[00:45:52.360 --> 00:45:56.160]   and something that we already know is totally flawed,
[00:45:56.160 --> 00:45:58.480]   'cause now when are they gonna change that again?
[00:45:58.480 --> 00:45:59.640]   Another decade.
[00:45:59.640 --> 00:46:01.160]   So for a decade, we're gonna be stuck with something
[00:46:01.160 --> 00:46:02.560]   that I already know is broken.
[00:46:02.560 --> 00:46:05.280]   It's already strongly disagree with the description
[00:46:05.280 --> 00:46:06.520]   of USPS, totally flawed.
[00:46:06.520 --> 00:46:08.240]   It has its flaws, but so does lightning.
[00:46:08.240 --> 00:46:09.760]   So frustrating.
[00:46:09.760 --> 00:46:10.600]   It's so frustrating.
[00:46:10.600 --> 00:46:11.440]   Well, the other thing though,
[00:46:11.440 --> 00:46:13.080]   is not regulating the type of USB-C.
[00:46:13.080 --> 00:46:15.960]   And there are a bunch of proprietary USB-C cables out there
[00:46:15.960 --> 00:46:18.240]   for all that high power delivery charging.
[00:46:18.240 --> 00:46:21.440]   Like people who charge up to 100 watts now,
[00:46:21.440 --> 00:46:23.320]   which is ridiculous amounts.
[00:46:23.320 --> 00:46:24.640]   Those aren't normal cables.
[00:46:24.640 --> 00:46:26.560]   If you lose that cable, you don't get that anymore.
[00:46:26.560 --> 00:46:28.800]   And they're not covering that sort of compatibility at all.
[00:46:28.800 --> 00:46:29.840]   Now if they said, if they said,
[00:46:29.840 --> 00:46:30.680]   they would be able to innovate,
[00:46:30.680 --> 00:46:31.520]   off fast charging.
[00:46:31.520 --> 00:46:33.840]   They said that it has to be a USB cable
[00:46:33.840 --> 00:46:36.960]   that can handle 100 watts and manage one gig per second.
[00:46:36.960 --> 00:46:38.040]   And that is the requirement.
[00:46:38.040 --> 00:46:39.280]   I'd be totally behind it.
[00:46:39.280 --> 00:46:41.320]   Like totally like, okay, we're gonna do--
[00:46:41.320 --> 00:46:43.520]   What Apple device besides the laptop wants 100 watts?
[00:46:43.520 --> 00:46:44.360]   Not the phone.
[00:46:44.360 --> 00:46:46.440]   I'm just saying that it's one cable that takes the--
[00:46:46.440 --> 00:46:48.840]   Well, Android phones will get full amount of data.
[00:46:48.840 --> 00:46:49.680]   That's cable of.
[00:46:49.680 --> 00:46:51.480]   If all the cables were the same--
[00:46:51.480 --> 00:46:53.120]   Well, you could solve that, Alex,
[00:46:53.120 --> 00:46:54.840]   by only buying those cables.
[00:46:54.840 --> 00:46:57.760]   You solve that by buying those cables.
[00:46:57.760 --> 00:46:59.320]   But the problem is, you're the one who's buying
[00:46:59.320 --> 00:47:00.440]   incompatible cables.
[00:47:00.440 --> 00:47:01.480]   Stop it.
[00:47:01.480 --> 00:47:03.600]   It's just that it's hard to find that.
[00:47:03.600 --> 00:47:04.840]   I literally have to buy them.
[00:47:04.840 --> 00:47:07.280]   There's a Google engineer that rated them all on Amazon.
[00:47:07.280 --> 00:47:09.680]   Yeah, by the way, he's a listener.
[00:47:09.680 --> 00:47:11.120]   And he's great.
[00:47:11.120 --> 00:47:13.520]   He's in our forums on a regular basis.
[00:47:13.520 --> 00:47:15.360]   Because there was such a mess with types,
[00:47:15.360 --> 00:47:18.080]   he cables damaging equipment.
[00:47:18.080 --> 00:47:19.960]   He went out and tested them all.
[00:47:19.960 --> 00:47:21.360]   But look, all you have to do is,
[00:47:21.360 --> 00:47:24.480]   the consumer is stop buying crack and fix it.
[00:47:24.480 --> 00:47:25.800]   But the consumers aren't gonna do that.
[00:47:25.800 --> 00:47:27.600]   They're just gonna buy them and throw them away.
[00:47:27.600 --> 00:47:29.680]   Okay, every cable you can buy today
[00:47:29.680 --> 00:47:31.720]   would charge an iPhone, period.
[00:47:31.720 --> 00:47:33.960]   There's no type of seat cable that would not charge an iPhone.
[00:47:33.960 --> 00:47:34.800]   But you would create--
[00:47:34.800 --> 00:47:35.640]   But you managed to date them.
[00:47:35.640 --> 00:47:36.480]   You used to be like that?
[00:47:36.480 --> 00:47:38.400]   No, no, we're talking about charging.
[00:47:38.400 --> 00:47:40.080]   I know, but it has to do both,
[00:47:40.080 --> 00:47:42.840]   or Apple will find some other way around it, it's fine.
[00:47:42.840 --> 00:47:44.200]   It'll just be something else.
[00:47:44.200 --> 00:47:45.600]   Well, Apple's already basically said,
[00:47:45.600 --> 00:47:46.440]   we're not gonna do it,
[00:47:46.440 --> 00:47:49.400]   we're gonna do probably a portless phone.
[00:47:49.400 --> 00:47:50.720]   Right.
[00:47:50.720 --> 00:47:52.920]   With some kind of little connector on the back
[00:47:52.920 --> 00:47:55.240]   that happens to do a bunch of other things.
[00:47:55.240 --> 00:47:56.080]   Right.
[00:47:56.080 --> 00:47:57.360]   I mean, I think that's probably,
[00:47:57.360 --> 00:47:58.640]   it'll be a data port that, oh, by the way,
[00:47:58.640 --> 00:47:59.880]   it does charge too.
[00:47:59.880 --> 00:48:01.720]   I'm just gonna go on record, you and I disagree.
[00:48:01.720 --> 00:48:02.760]   This is a very good thing.
[00:48:02.760 --> 00:48:05.200]   They should, you should move forward.
[00:48:05.200 --> 00:48:06.040]   That's the right thing.
[00:48:06.040 --> 00:48:07.240]   I'm gonna say it again, I'm absurd.
[00:48:07.240 --> 00:48:08.880]   I want Thunderbolt on the iPhone Pro.
[00:48:08.880 --> 00:48:10.960]   I know you can't fit Thunderbolt controllers in there.
[00:48:10.960 --> 00:48:12.680]   I know they don't have four open,
[00:48:12.680 --> 00:48:17.040]   the Thunderbolt lanes that they would need for it.
[00:48:17.040 --> 00:48:19.880]   But I still want it just because six gigabytes per minute.
[00:48:19.880 --> 00:48:22.720]   I wanna be able to connect an external display to an iPhone.
[00:48:22.720 --> 00:48:24.760]   I do, I would love to be able to plug this,
[00:48:24.760 --> 00:48:26.720]   the same CalDigit doc that got on my MacBook right now.
[00:48:26.720 --> 00:48:27.720]   And my needs are not reasonable.
[00:48:27.720 --> 00:48:29.200]   Can we do that, by the way, on the many?
[00:48:29.200 --> 00:48:31.760]   I think, did they decide whether we could--
[00:48:31.760 --> 00:48:33.120]   Yes, but not Thunderbolt.
[00:48:33.120 --> 00:48:34.240]   You can use USB-C display on it.
[00:48:34.240 --> 00:48:36.040]   But you can use a USB-C display on it.
[00:48:36.040 --> 00:48:37.600]   And it does have data, obviously,
[00:48:37.600 --> 00:48:39.960]   which means I can connect my USB-C.
[00:48:39.960 --> 00:48:41.480]   And times faster than lightning.
[00:48:41.480 --> 00:48:42.320]   Yeah, so.
[00:48:42.320 --> 00:48:43.920]   Don't make me cry, Leo.
[00:48:43.920 --> 00:48:45.280]   I know, if it's such a flood,
[00:48:45.280 --> 00:48:47.920]   I think why is Apple putting it on their devices?
[00:48:47.920 --> 00:48:49.600]   It's very hard for Apple to argue,
[00:48:49.600 --> 00:48:51.360]   oh, we don't wanna use Type C.
[00:48:51.360 --> 00:48:54.040]   When they put it on everything except the iPhone.
[00:48:54.040 --> 00:48:54.880]   Again, I think--
[00:48:54.880 --> 00:48:56.000]   They consider the iPad a computer
[00:48:56.000 --> 00:48:58.320]   and they want the compatibility with computer style peripheral
[00:48:58.320 --> 00:48:59.160]   on the iPad.
[00:48:59.160 --> 00:49:00.680]   I think the problem is they don't consider the phone a peripheral.
[00:49:00.680 --> 00:49:02.440]   My complaint is not that the USB-C exists
[00:49:02.440 --> 00:49:03.960]   or that it's on the iPad or not.
[00:49:03.960 --> 00:49:07.000]   It's just that governments are horribly slow and inefficient.
[00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:08.000]   So they're gonna make this,
[00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:09.400]   and then it's gonna stay there for 10 years
[00:49:09.400 --> 00:49:11.160]   'cause they can't decide on what the next one's gonna be.
[00:49:11.160 --> 00:49:13.720]   And so the thing is, is that my argument is not
[00:49:13.720 --> 00:49:15.200]   that the USB-C shouldn't exist
[00:49:15.200 --> 00:49:17.400]   or that we can't buy a cable that doesn't work.
[00:49:17.400 --> 00:49:18.680]   It's that they're going to put this in.
[00:49:18.680 --> 00:49:20.120]   They won't be able to decide on something else.
[00:49:20.120 --> 00:49:21.720]   So we'll be stuck with it for a decade
[00:49:21.720 --> 00:49:23.080]   and we already know it's broken.
[00:49:23.080 --> 00:49:24.840]   So it's already five years old.
[00:49:24.840 --> 00:49:27.720]   It's already broken and we're gonna now say
[00:49:27.720 --> 00:49:29.560]   that it has to be the only way to handle this.
[00:49:29.560 --> 00:49:32.320]   And so that's the problem.
[00:49:32.320 --> 00:49:33.880]   It's not the problem with USB-C.
[00:49:33.880 --> 00:49:37.000]   It's just that we're basically reaching into the past,
[00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:39.880]   grabbing something that isn't fully functional
[00:49:39.880 --> 00:49:43.320]   and we're gonna lay concrete for the next decade.
[00:49:43.320 --> 00:49:46.520]   And basically in the next decade, it won't matter
[00:49:46.520 --> 00:49:48.720]   because we're not gonna, because of this,
[00:49:48.720 --> 00:49:51.200]   we'll just get everyone will get past it.
[00:49:51.200 --> 00:49:52.760]   It's just gonna accelerate us getting rid
[00:49:52.760 --> 00:49:54.800]   of the connectors altogether.
[00:49:54.800 --> 00:49:56.280]   So it's fine.
[00:49:56.280 --> 00:49:58.440]   - I think Apple will be alone in that, but we'll see.
[00:49:58.440 --> 00:50:00.320]   You know, a lot of people follow up those paths
[00:50:00.320 --> 00:50:01.600]   when they took away the headphone jack.
[00:50:01.600 --> 00:50:02.600]   Everybody copied that.
[00:50:02.600 --> 00:50:04.520]   So it may be--
[00:50:04.520 --> 00:50:05.680]   - You'll be one of the Chinese companies.
[00:50:05.680 --> 00:50:08.160]   They're gonna have, remember the air wireless charger?
[00:50:08.160 --> 00:50:10.240]   They showed off a year ago, that still doesn't work.
[00:50:10.240 --> 00:50:11.360]   Where it looks like an air conditioning unit
[00:50:11.360 --> 00:50:12.960]   in your apartment, you just walk around
[00:50:12.960 --> 00:50:15.600]   and your phone charges without radiating your--
[00:50:15.600 --> 00:50:17.240]   - I think the other reason is the reasons
[00:50:17.240 --> 00:50:18.760]   why Tesla was considered a genius.
[00:50:18.760 --> 00:50:20.520]   There was also reasons why Tesla was considered
[00:50:20.520 --> 00:50:21.440]   to be kind of a nut.
[00:50:21.440 --> 00:50:23.680]   And one of them was we're gonna have this immense
[00:50:23.680 --> 00:50:26.640]   statue of Liberty generator in the middle of every town,
[00:50:26.640 --> 00:50:28.960]   pelting the atmosphere with electrons,
[00:50:28.960 --> 00:50:31.040]   so that you can hold a light bulb in your hand
[00:50:31.040 --> 00:50:31.880]   and light like--
[00:50:31.880 --> 00:50:33.680]   - The funny thing was, is it was the six hertz,
[00:50:33.680 --> 00:50:35.960]   was the crazy part of Tesla, 'cause it's like what
[00:50:35.960 --> 00:50:38.000]   every living being lives on.
[00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:39.000]   - Right.
[00:50:39.000 --> 00:50:42.000]   - Yeah, like, it might not be a good idea to put that in the air.
[00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:44.080]   - Hey, as long as you're not an elephant
[00:50:44.080 --> 00:50:45.600]   and your handler's not Thomas Edison--
[00:50:45.600 --> 00:50:46.600]   - I was at a secure, okay.
[00:50:46.600 --> 00:50:47.840]   - I was at a sit down, right?
[00:50:47.840 --> 00:50:50.160]   - Well, you would be Reed Richards.
[00:50:50.160 --> 00:50:51.000]   - Just you would work out fine.
[00:50:51.000 --> 00:50:53.120]   - So, let's take a break.
[00:50:53.120 --> 00:50:54.800]   And then we come back.
[00:50:54.800 --> 00:50:59.800]   Is Apple's ad blocking really just security theater?
[00:50:59.800 --> 00:51:04.280]   - Big study by the Washington Post says,
[00:51:04.280 --> 00:51:05.920]   "Yeah, you know what?
[00:51:05.920 --> 00:51:07.240]   Everybody's ignoring it."

[00:51:40.200 --> 00:51:43.080]   Actually, I have to say I really like the Galaxy Flip 3
[00:51:43.080 --> 00:51:45.720]   because it has fingerprint reader--
[00:51:45.720 --> 00:51:46.560]   - Yes.
[00:51:46.560 --> 00:51:47.800]   - And type C charging.
[00:51:47.800 --> 00:51:50.280]   It's got the things I really look for in a phone.
[00:51:51.280 --> 00:51:53.240]   All right.
[00:51:53.240 --> 00:51:57.600]   Let's talk about this Washington Post study.
[00:51:57.600 --> 00:52:01.240]   They did it in connection with a group called a lockdown.
[00:52:01.240 --> 00:52:07.160]   And what it appears to be is that even though Apple
[00:52:07.160 --> 00:52:11.320]   has kind of required companies to pop up
[00:52:11.320 --> 00:52:13.560]   when I just did it with Talketone,
[00:52:13.560 --> 00:52:15.880]   when you launch a new app saying,
[00:52:15.880 --> 00:52:19.760]   "Would you like this company to track you or not?"
[00:52:19.760 --> 00:52:22.120]   Of course, most people are choosing not.
[00:52:22.120 --> 00:52:26.800]   That companies are doing it anyway.
[00:52:26.800 --> 00:52:28.960]   Is Apple not enforcing this?
[00:52:28.960 --> 00:52:31.080]   What's the story?
[00:52:31.080 --> 00:52:34.520]   - They can only enforce what's on iOS.
[00:52:34.520 --> 00:52:36.840]   So whatever you're doing on the phone,
[00:52:36.840 --> 00:52:38.760]   like if you're trying to track between apps on the phone,
[00:52:38.760 --> 00:52:40.440]   their API prevents you from doing that.
[00:52:40.440 --> 00:52:42.440]   They can't control what you do on the web.
[00:52:42.440 --> 00:52:44.160]   So they said from the very beginning when they announced it
[00:52:44.160 --> 00:52:46.080]   that they have to rely on an honor system
[00:52:46.080 --> 00:52:48.360]   that when you say, "Don't track me,"
[00:52:48.360 --> 00:52:50.840]   they should respect the wishes of their customer.
[00:52:50.840 --> 00:52:52.520]   And if they get reported for not doing that,
[00:52:52.520 --> 00:52:54.200]   Apple will have a conversation with them.
[00:52:54.200 --> 00:52:56.840]   But ultimately they don't own anything that's off the phone.
[00:52:56.840 --> 00:52:57.960]   - Yeah.
[00:52:57.960 --> 00:52:59.760]   So this is also, I mean,
[00:52:59.760 --> 00:53:01.800]   a typical security process is a funnel.
[00:53:01.800 --> 00:53:03.880]   So you basically start going,
[00:53:03.880 --> 00:53:05.480]   "I'm gonna start asking for something.
[00:53:05.480 --> 00:53:07.240]   "I'm gonna start tracking something.
[00:53:07.240 --> 00:53:08.920]   "I'm gonna start enforcing something.
[00:53:08.920 --> 00:53:12.240]   "I'm gonna start reinforcing that with bigger."
[00:53:12.240 --> 00:53:13.960]   And then I'm gonna be absolute about it.
[00:53:13.960 --> 00:53:15.040]   So what we're at is,
[00:53:15.040 --> 00:53:16.800]   I'm gonna start asking for something.
[00:53:16.800 --> 00:53:18.560]   And so the thing is, is that,
[00:53:18.560 --> 00:53:21.240]   but how you handle security is you start warning people.
[00:53:21.240 --> 00:53:22.200]   You start telling them,
[00:53:22.200 --> 00:53:23.760]   you start putting in the places,
[00:53:23.760 --> 00:53:26.040]   but you're starting to just put these little tags in
[00:53:26.040 --> 00:53:30.040]   that you are slowly tying in,
[00:53:30.040 --> 00:53:31.040]   that you can then--
[00:53:31.040 --> 00:53:33.280]   - Private relays all the web.
[00:53:33.280 --> 00:53:34.720]   - Sorry?
[00:53:34.720 --> 00:53:36.120]   - Private relay solves for the web part
[00:53:36.120 --> 00:53:38.640]   because Apple physically prevents you from being tracked at them.
[00:53:38.640 --> 00:53:40.840]   - So the point is, is that Apple is just at the beginning
[00:53:40.840 --> 00:53:42.080]   of something, they're not at the end.
[00:53:42.080 --> 00:53:44.200]   You know, and so this is just them starting
[00:53:44.200 --> 00:53:45.320]   to turn the crank.
[00:53:45.320 --> 00:53:47.000]   And because if you turn the crank too hard,
[00:53:47.000 --> 00:53:48.080]   then everyone's all upset,
[00:53:48.080 --> 00:53:49.240]   and everyone's all, "This isn't fair,
[00:53:49.240 --> 00:53:50.080]   "and this isn't whatever."
[00:53:50.080 --> 00:53:51.280]   So you just kinda just,
[00:53:51.280 --> 00:53:54.800]   you're basically corralling a whole lot of cattle.
[00:53:54.800 --> 00:53:55.800]   (laughing)
[00:53:55.800 --> 00:53:56.640]   - In a shoot.
[00:53:56.640 --> 00:53:58.920]   - Into a shoot, you know, and so,
[00:53:58.920 --> 00:54:00.120]   but you have to start gently,
[00:54:00.120 --> 00:54:01.760]   and that's what Apple's doing, I think.
[00:54:01.760 --> 00:54:02.600]   - I mean, I'm gonna say--
[00:54:02.600 --> 00:54:05.720]   - Fowler and Tatum Hunter in the Washington Post.
[00:54:05.720 --> 00:54:07.240]   This is the story.
[00:54:07.240 --> 00:54:09.440]   They quote, and by the way,
[00:54:09.440 --> 00:54:11.640]   this is a research that is with lockdown.
[00:54:11.640 --> 00:54:13.520]   Say you open the app Subway surfers,
[00:54:13.520 --> 00:54:15.440]   listed as one of the app stores, must play games.
[00:54:15.440 --> 00:54:18.080]   It's asks if you're okay with app tracking,
[00:54:18.080 --> 00:54:19.640]   we've all seen this dialogue.
[00:54:19.640 --> 00:54:23.640]   And most people, apparently, are saying,
[00:54:23.640 --> 00:54:25.600]   "Ask app not to track."
[00:54:25.600 --> 00:54:26.680]   I don't blame them.
[00:54:26.680 --> 00:54:29.360]   But something curious happens, they write,
[00:54:29.360 --> 00:54:31.040]   "After you ask not to be tracked,
[00:54:31.040 --> 00:54:32.840]   "according to investigation by researchers
[00:54:32.840 --> 00:54:34.040]   "at Privacy Software Maker,
[00:54:34.040 --> 00:54:35.800]   "lockdown in the Washington Post,
[00:54:35.800 --> 00:54:40.120]   "subway surfers starts sending an outside ad company
[00:54:40.120 --> 00:54:41.760]   "called Chart Boost,
[00:54:41.760 --> 00:54:45.320]   "29 very specific data points about your iPhone."
[00:54:45.320 --> 00:54:50.320]   All it turns out is you're turning off the ID for advertisers.
[00:54:50.320 --> 00:54:53.720]   Apple says nothing about sending things out like,
[00:54:53.720 --> 00:54:55.480]   you're in an address, you're free storage,
[00:54:55.480 --> 00:54:59.520]   your current volume level, your battery level.
[00:54:59.520 --> 00:55:02.040]   And why they don't care about your battery level,
[00:55:02.040 --> 00:55:05.480]   but it turns out if you combine these 29 data points,
[00:55:05.480 --> 00:55:07.760]   that's a fingerprinting technique.
[00:55:07.760 --> 00:55:09.560]   It's almost exactly unique.
[00:55:09.560 --> 00:55:12.560]   It's almost exactly unique.
[00:55:12.560 --> 00:55:15.240]   If I know your volume level, your battery level,
[00:55:15.240 --> 00:55:17.520]   your address, your free storage,
[00:55:17.520 --> 00:55:19.440]   I know who you are, basically.
[00:55:19.440 --> 00:55:22.880]   Apple says apps aren't allowed to track people
[00:55:22.880 --> 00:55:24.200]   who say they don't want it.
[00:55:24.200 --> 00:55:28.120]   Finger printing is not something Apple
[00:55:28.120 --> 00:55:30.320]   can probably do anything about, right?
[00:55:30.320 --> 00:55:32.600]   - They do this safari.
[00:55:32.600 --> 00:55:34.120]   They're starting to block all that kind of relaying
[00:55:34.120 --> 00:55:36.200]   and safari and private relay is gonna start sending you
[00:55:36.200 --> 00:55:37.280]   through those anonymous relays,
[00:55:37.280 --> 00:55:38.360]   so they won't be able to--
[00:55:38.360 --> 00:55:39.840]   - At least your IP address won't be,
[00:55:39.840 --> 00:55:41.960]   your public IP address won't be visible.
[00:55:41.960 --> 00:55:44.600]   But finger printing goes around all that stuff too.
[00:55:44.600 --> 00:55:46.880]   - Them doing that in the office--
[00:55:46.880 --> 00:55:47.760]   - And the office goes a violation
[00:55:47.760 --> 00:55:49.960]   and I won't be surprised if Apple starts prosecuting that.
[00:55:49.960 --> 00:55:50.800]   Sorry Andy.
[00:55:50.800 --> 00:55:51.640]   - Yeah.
[00:55:51.640 --> 00:55:53.960]   Everything you're saying is great.
[00:55:53.960 --> 00:55:55.960]   There's a cold war brewing, however,
[00:55:55.960 --> 00:55:58.400]   that makes this kind of an unsolable problem
[00:55:58.400 --> 00:56:00.760]   because there's gonna be a point at which
[00:56:00.760 --> 00:56:04.560]   the companies that rely on tracking
[00:56:04.560 --> 00:56:06.520]   for making money and staying in business,
[00:56:06.520 --> 00:56:07.840]   at some point they're going to say,
[00:56:07.840 --> 00:56:11.240]   "Oh, we're not gonna simply now give you a pop-up that says,
[00:56:11.240 --> 00:56:12.520]   "Oh, we've got an ad tracker on,
[00:56:12.520 --> 00:56:13.680]   "we consider turning it off."
[00:56:13.680 --> 00:56:16.880]   We're gonna say, "Oh, well, enjoy HTML 1.0
[00:56:16.880 --> 00:56:20.360]   "and no news, no functionality, no nothing.
[00:56:20.360 --> 00:56:21.720]   "We're not gonna turn those on for you
[00:56:21.720 --> 00:56:23.760]   "unless we can actually actively track you."
[00:56:23.760 --> 00:56:24.600]   - I think--
[00:56:24.600 --> 00:56:27.040]   - I think I'm saying that everything that Apple does
[00:56:27.040 --> 00:56:28.720]   and Google does at independent companies
[00:56:28.720 --> 00:56:31.520]   to limit it is important and has to happen.
[00:56:31.520 --> 00:56:33.880]   They, but we can't blame any of these companies
[00:56:33.880 --> 00:56:35.760]   when there are loopholes found and ways around it
[00:56:35.760 --> 00:56:39.920]   because everything that these tracking companies do
[00:56:39.920 --> 00:56:43.760]   are trying to find a way around forcing a website
[00:56:43.760 --> 00:56:45.680]   to put up a planner saying,
[00:56:45.680 --> 00:56:47.040]   "Hey, we're not giving you Jack
[00:56:47.040 --> 00:56:48.480]   "because you're not letting us track us."
[00:56:48.480 --> 00:56:51.080]   'Cause that's counterproductive.
[00:56:51.080 --> 00:56:52.320]   - They're essentially pickpocketing us.
[00:56:52.320 --> 00:56:55.360]   So if we don't let them pickpocket us for our information,
[00:56:55.360 --> 00:56:57.640]   they'll wanna not let us in
[00:56:57.640 --> 00:56:59.040]   'cause we're like, "Hey, you can come into the theater
[00:56:59.040 --> 00:57:01.000]   "as long as I can keep on pickpocketing you."
[00:57:01.000 --> 00:57:03.040]   Like, I got a bunch of pickpockets in here
[00:57:03.040 --> 00:57:04.320]   and we're just gonna start grabbing stuff from you
[00:57:04.320 --> 00:57:05.680]   as you go through it.
[00:57:05.680 --> 00:57:07.840]   And so they, we'll keep on letting,
[00:57:07.840 --> 00:57:09.240]   "Oh, we can't let you in theater anymore
[00:57:09.240 --> 00:57:11.840]   "because we can't steal from you when you're not looking."
[00:57:11.840 --> 00:57:14.520]   And so you're absolutely right.
[00:57:14.520 --> 00:57:17.000]   I just think that there's a lot of behavior of people
[00:57:17.000 --> 00:57:18.480]   who are going to just basically say,
[00:57:18.480 --> 00:57:20.200]   "Well, then I can't go to that website."
[00:57:20.200 --> 00:57:22.400]   And I think that that's the weight that they have
[00:57:22.400 --> 00:57:25.720]   is that they have to try to make it good enough
[00:57:25.720 --> 00:57:28.800]   to make it worth someone giving them the information.
[00:57:28.800 --> 00:57:31.160]   And I love the idea that they just turn it off
[00:57:31.160 --> 00:57:32.960]   if they don't get what they need.
[00:57:32.960 --> 00:57:34.720]   And so they'll get to see,
[00:57:34.720 --> 00:57:37.320]   like there's a lot of paywalls and I pay for some of things
[00:57:37.320 --> 00:57:38.680]   and I choose not to pay for other ones
[00:57:38.680 --> 00:57:41.200]   'cause I'm like, "Oh, their data's not like the Washington Post.
[00:57:41.200 --> 00:57:42.280]   "Their data's not worth it.
[00:57:42.280 --> 00:57:43.440]   "We paid for it."
[00:57:43.440 --> 00:57:44.320]   So like.
[00:57:44.320 --> 00:57:45.960]   - So it's interesting because I don't know
[00:57:45.960 --> 00:57:49.480]   if that's the consequence end users wanted.
[00:57:49.480 --> 00:57:51.680]   - Well, they can just ask--
[00:57:51.680 --> 00:57:52.520]   - But that may be the consequence.
[00:57:52.520 --> 00:57:53.760]   - I give it to some companies.
[00:57:53.760 --> 00:57:55.240]   - Well, you know, I thought it was interesting.
[00:57:55.240 --> 00:57:56.520]   You saw what Apple had talked to them.
[00:57:56.520 --> 00:57:58.920]   They said, "Look, if we don't track you,
[00:57:58.920 --> 00:58:01.760]   "we can't give you a free phone number
[00:58:01.760 --> 00:58:03.120]   "'cause the ads are--
[00:58:03.120 --> 00:58:03.960]   - You can just say, "I did that too."
[00:58:03.960 --> 00:58:04.800]   - Yeah.
[00:58:04.800 --> 00:58:06.680]   - Like keep us free by allowing us to track you on things.
[00:58:06.680 --> 00:58:08.760]   Like, I just want informed consent.
[00:58:08.760 --> 00:58:10.720]   Like if I don't know that's happening
[00:58:10.720 --> 00:58:12.680]   and someone tells me suddenly I'm freaked out,
[00:58:12.680 --> 00:58:14.400]   I think they're listening into me with the microphone
[00:58:14.400 --> 00:58:16.200]   because they're so good at profiling.
[00:58:16.200 --> 00:58:17.760]   Like it creates all these urban myths
[00:58:17.760 --> 00:58:20.280]   and all this stress and all this agita that I don't need.
[00:58:20.280 --> 00:58:22.720]   I just like say, "You wanna keep using your free Gmail?
[00:58:22.720 --> 00:58:24.880]   "We need the ability to serve you," target.
[00:58:24.880 --> 00:58:27.120]   I like, "Okay, because I'd have to pay 30 bucks
[00:58:27.120 --> 00:58:28.080]   "for this otherwise."
[00:58:28.080 --> 00:58:29.160]   But like if I don't know,
[00:58:29.160 --> 00:58:30.720]   I can't make an informed decision.
[00:58:30.720 --> 00:58:32.680]   - They're gonna have to do that
[00:58:32.680 --> 00:58:35.440]   because I don't think consumers want that choice
[00:58:35.440 --> 00:58:39.040]   between paying $7 a month for something
[00:58:39.040 --> 00:58:41.880]   that they were getting free because of ads.
[00:58:41.880 --> 00:58:43.560]   And if you say, "Well, really, all the tracking
[00:58:43.560 --> 00:58:47.520]   "is allowing ads to be targeting you,
[00:58:47.520 --> 00:58:51.800]   "would you rather have that or pay seven bucks a month?"
[00:58:51.800 --> 00:58:54.800]   I think a lot of people would say, "Oh, okay,
[00:58:54.800 --> 00:58:56.280]   "give me the ads."
[00:58:56.280 --> 00:58:57.120]   - Right, well then--
[00:58:57.120 --> 00:58:57.960]   - And they should--
[00:58:57.960 --> 00:58:59.800]   - And that's how we have to do it.
[00:58:59.800 --> 00:59:01.520]   - That should be totally above board.
[00:59:01.520 --> 00:59:02.520]   And this is what we're gonna do,
[00:59:02.520 --> 00:59:04.120]   and you have to do one or the other.
[00:59:04.120 --> 00:59:05.920]   A lot of the problem that they have
[00:59:05.920 --> 00:59:08.240]   is that a lot of the most valuable consumers
[00:59:08.240 --> 00:59:10.600]   are choosing to pay for not getting the ads.
[00:59:10.600 --> 00:59:11.640]   You know, like they're just choosing to pay
[00:59:11.640 --> 00:59:12.800]   their YouTube plus whatever.
[00:59:12.800 --> 00:59:13.640]   - Well, that's interesting.
[00:59:13.640 --> 00:59:14.560]   What would you get?
[00:59:14.560 --> 00:59:15.880]   What are the advertisers getting?
[00:59:15.880 --> 00:59:18.280]   All the people who don't wanna pay.
[00:59:18.280 --> 00:59:22.440]   - Yeah, and so the folks with the most expendable income
[00:59:22.440 --> 00:59:24.640]   are basically opting out.
[00:59:24.640 --> 00:59:26.040]   - Fingerprinting is an issue.
[00:59:26.040 --> 00:59:27.480]   I mean, Google did this too.
[00:59:27.480 --> 00:59:31.160]   Remember, Google said we're gonna turn off third party cookies
[00:59:31.160 --> 00:59:33.240]   and we're gonna come up with something called Flock
[00:59:33.240 --> 00:59:35.400]   that respects your privacy.
[00:59:35.400 --> 00:59:37.320]   - Which is kind of the worst.
[00:59:37.320 --> 00:59:39.080]   - One of the reasons Google can do that
[00:59:39.080 --> 00:59:42.200]   is 'cause they have first party information.
[00:59:42.200 --> 00:59:43.400]   So they don't-- - They own the browser.
[00:59:43.400 --> 00:59:45.040]   - They have all the fingerprinting.
[00:59:45.040 --> 00:59:46.120]   They know exactly who you are.
[00:59:46.120 --> 00:59:47.800]   They don't need third party cookies.
[00:59:47.800 --> 00:59:49.120]   - They don't just own the platform.
[00:59:49.120 --> 00:59:50.560]   - They own the browser for every platform.
[00:59:50.560 --> 00:59:51.560]   - Right, right.
[00:59:51.560 --> 00:59:53.080]   But it also speaks to how difficult it is
[00:59:53.080 --> 00:59:55.480]   to do anything good in a browser.
[00:59:55.480 --> 00:59:57.480]   Their latest version of Chrome
[00:59:57.480 --> 00:59:59.800]   has a super controversial feature
[00:59:59.800 --> 01:00:03.240]   that could actually make a lot of web apps run better.
[01:00:03.240 --> 01:00:07.000]   The ability for a website to tell
[01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:09.800]   that a page is idle, that your attention
[01:00:09.800 --> 01:00:11.280]   is not on this browser.
[01:00:11.280 --> 01:00:13.240]   And when they make the case for why
[01:00:13.240 --> 01:00:15.520]   it was they first proposed it a couple of years ago,
[01:00:15.520 --> 01:00:17.080]   they said, "Well, that's because that way
[01:00:17.080 --> 01:00:18.520]   "you can have a chat app that will automatically
[01:00:18.520 --> 01:00:20.480]   "change your status to a way if you're away.
[01:00:20.480 --> 01:00:22.520]   "That way that other browsers and other pieces
[01:00:22.520 --> 01:00:23.880]   "of hardware can check that, okay, well,
[01:00:23.880 --> 01:00:25.560]   "if this code is not doing anything,
[01:00:25.560 --> 01:00:27.600]   "then we're not just gonna simply freeze this.
[01:00:27.600 --> 01:00:28.760]   "We're gonna actually close this window
[01:00:28.760 --> 01:00:31.000]   "and save stuff, all this other sort of stuff."
[01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:33.840]   But of course, Mozilla and of course Apple,
[01:00:33.840 --> 01:00:37.280]   their web team raised objections
[01:00:37.280 --> 01:00:38.600]   because that's a really good way
[01:00:38.600 --> 01:00:41.080]   to get nasty third party people to figure out,
[01:00:41.080 --> 01:00:42.880]   "Ooh, so it turns out that I bet
[01:00:42.880 --> 01:00:45.840]   "that this means that he's asleep from 3 a.m.
[01:00:45.840 --> 01:00:46.920]   "until 9 a.m.
[01:00:46.920 --> 01:00:49.960]   "Okay, but he's also gone idle from noon until 1.30,
[01:00:49.960 --> 01:00:51.320]   "so that's when he has lunch.
[01:00:51.320 --> 01:00:53.480]   "So it's a way to not only fingerprint you,
[01:00:53.480 --> 01:00:55.840]   "but also say, gee, he's not paying attention
[01:00:55.840 --> 01:00:57.760]   "to this webpage.
[01:00:57.760 --> 01:01:00.640]   "What if we had more flashing lights and more colors
[01:01:00.640 --> 01:01:05.200]   "to try and more exciting and disturbing information
[01:01:05.200 --> 01:01:06.800]   "on it to get his attention back?
[01:01:06.800 --> 01:01:10.240]   "So we can't have nice things, and oftentimes it's because
[01:01:10.240 --> 01:01:12.040]   "we are putting limitations on technology
[01:01:12.040 --> 01:01:14.840]   "based on how badly third party trackers
[01:01:14.840 --> 01:01:16.120]   "are going to take advantage of it."
[01:01:16.120 --> 01:01:16.960]   - Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[01:01:16.960 --> 01:01:19.560]   - They won't, they'll start a playlist for my videos
[01:01:19.560 --> 01:01:21.240]   and then they'll know that they're not watching them,
[01:01:21.240 --> 01:01:23.280]   so they'll stop paying me for all those videos
[01:01:23.280 --> 01:01:24.640]   that they just put on and walked away
[01:01:24.640 --> 01:01:25.880]   and never watched Andy.
[01:01:25.880 --> 01:01:28.680]   And now my position on this is flip-flopping.
[01:01:28.680 --> 01:01:30.520]   (laughing)
[01:01:30.520 --> 01:01:31.600]   - Welcome to the club.
[01:01:31.600 --> 01:01:34.880]   - You've got a farm at Hong Kong that you're paying
[01:01:34.880 --> 01:01:38.120]   to just keep your faders on autoplay all the time, aren't you?
[01:01:38.120 --> 01:01:39.760]   - You know what, it's a worthy room.
[01:01:39.760 --> 01:01:40.600]   - It's a worthy room.
[01:01:40.600 --> 01:01:41.440]   - And they forget that at autoplay.
[01:01:41.440 --> 01:01:42.280]   - I know, I know.
[01:01:42.280 --> 01:01:43.600]   - That's real income, Andy.
[01:01:43.600 --> 01:01:44.600]   (laughing)
[01:01:44.600 --> 01:01:47.160]   - Well, and by the way, there's also a study
[01:01:47.160 --> 01:01:49.920]   that shows that Facebook seems to be losing money
[01:01:49.920 --> 01:01:54.040]   because of Apple's ad blocking, so even if it doesn't work,
[01:01:54.040 --> 01:01:55.040]   it's working.
[01:01:55.040 --> 01:01:55.880]   - It's working again.
[01:01:55.880 --> 01:01:57.200]   It's the beginning.
[01:01:57.200 --> 01:01:59.680]   And part of it is, is it from a PR campaign
[01:01:59.680 --> 01:02:01.400]   when you have to keep on filling those things out
[01:02:01.400 --> 01:02:04.760]   on every webpage and the apps and everything else,
[01:02:04.760 --> 01:02:07.120]   it just keeps feeling grosser, like it's new.
[01:02:07.120 --> 01:02:09.080]   Like really, or you doing that?
[01:02:09.080 --> 01:02:11.240]   You know, like really, you wanna do that?
[01:02:11.240 --> 01:02:13.280]   Come on, like this is like a clock app
[01:02:13.280 --> 01:02:14.680]   that is asking to track the--
[01:02:14.680 --> 01:02:15.520]   - Or the thing shocked me.
[01:02:15.520 --> 01:02:17.080]   - Or whatever it is that you're just like,
[01:02:17.080 --> 01:02:19.040]   so part of this is a slow draw
[01:02:19.040 --> 01:02:21.400]   in basically making everyone look bad.
[01:02:21.400 --> 01:02:25.000]   - It's a shame though that they hadn't been up front
[01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:25.840]   in the beginning.
[01:02:25.840 --> 01:02:28.800]   I mean, if you just are up front and say,
[01:02:28.800 --> 01:02:31.920]   look, this isn't a free service which is paid for
[01:02:31.920 --> 01:02:36.640]   with advertising and advertising buyers and agencies
[01:02:36.640 --> 01:02:39.440]   wanna know who's seeing the ad,
[01:02:39.440 --> 01:02:41.920]   so we have to turn this stuff on.
[01:02:41.920 --> 01:02:43.600]   If you don't want it, you could pay.
[01:02:43.600 --> 01:02:45.400]   I mean, that's what we're doing by the way.
[01:02:45.400 --> 01:02:46.720]   - But it's like a blue-tipped company.
[01:02:46.720 --> 01:02:48.080]   - That's what Club Twit was created
[01:02:48.080 --> 01:02:52.160]   because we realized advertisers increasingly wanted us to do,
[01:02:52.160 --> 01:02:54.960]   you know, things like chart beat or chartable we do.
[01:02:54.960 --> 01:02:56.800]   And pod sites.
[01:02:56.800 --> 01:02:59.560]   And so we wanna give people a choice,
[01:02:59.560 --> 01:03:01.880]   seven bucks a month and no tracking, no ads,
[01:03:01.880 --> 01:03:04.960]   or you get everything for free just as you always did,
[01:03:04.960 --> 01:03:07.880]   but you should know that in order for us to sell ads,
[01:03:07.880 --> 01:03:09.720]   we have to put some things in there.
[01:03:09.720 --> 01:03:13.360]   I think the thing we do is the least intrusive tracking
[01:03:13.360 --> 01:03:16.400]   you can do and I expect advertisers next year to say,
[01:03:16.400 --> 01:03:18.280]   oh no, we wanna know more.
[01:03:18.280 --> 01:03:20.000]   Like they already say that.
[01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:21.480]   - They did the shock.
[01:03:21.480 --> 01:03:22.880]   Like when they did the Bluetooth tracking,
[01:03:22.880 --> 01:03:24.720]   like all of a sudden when it went on iOS,
[01:03:24.720 --> 01:03:26.960]   they have nothing to do with Bluetooth.
[01:03:26.960 --> 01:03:29.080]   We're suddenly flashing up all those requesters.
[01:03:29.080 --> 01:03:30.240]   And it was the same thing with this.
[01:03:30.240 --> 01:03:31.920]   Apps that I would never have expected
[01:03:31.920 --> 01:03:33.360]   were tracking me across the internet.
[01:03:33.360 --> 01:03:35.200]   Suddenly they were asking, like I just,
[01:03:35.200 --> 01:03:36.600]   I started like a video player who's like,
[01:03:36.600 --> 01:03:37.520]   can we track you?
[01:03:37.520 --> 01:03:39.200]   I'm like, wait, what are you doing?
[01:03:39.200 --> 01:03:41.200]   I had no idea that their side hustle
[01:03:41.200 --> 01:03:44.120]   was just accumulating vast amounts of data to sell to bro.
[01:03:44.120 --> 01:03:44.960]   - Well that is a problem.
[01:03:44.960 --> 01:03:45.800]   - Suddenly they were exposed.
[01:03:45.800 --> 01:03:46.880]   - Yeah, that is a problem, yeah.
[01:03:46.880 --> 01:03:49.360]   Joe in our chat room says, one problem, I agree with him.
[01:03:49.360 --> 01:03:51.080]   One problem is that people have been conditioned
[01:03:51.080 --> 01:03:53.120]   to expect everything to be free.
[01:03:53.120 --> 01:03:55.520]   So people who pay a thousand dollars or more for a phone
[01:03:55.520 --> 01:03:57.880]   don't want to pay five bucks for an app.
[01:03:57.880 --> 01:03:59.040]   So this is what you get.
[01:03:59.040 --> 01:04:00.960]   Well, all right, it's not, you know,
[01:04:00.960 --> 01:04:04.040]   we got to talk a tone, can't give me a phone number for free.
[01:04:04.040 --> 01:04:05.760]   It costs some money.
[01:04:05.760 --> 01:04:08.840]   - Also, also users are expecting things to just work
[01:04:08.840 --> 01:04:11.600]   without any problems or any interaction whatsoever.
[01:04:11.600 --> 01:04:13.680]   So this is one of the problems that Apple has to deal with
[01:04:13.680 --> 01:04:15.920]   where if there's suddenly a position
[01:04:15.920 --> 01:04:19.520]   where an important feature of a site or social network
[01:04:19.520 --> 01:04:21.400]   that they use a lot doesn't work anymore,
[01:04:21.400 --> 01:04:23.440]   and they're told, well, unfortunately under I,
[01:04:23.440 --> 01:04:25.160]   because you've upgraded to the new iOS 15,
[01:04:25.160 --> 01:04:27.880]   iOS 15 does not work with this feature anymore
[01:04:27.880 --> 01:04:29.360]   because of privacy features.
[01:04:29.360 --> 01:04:30.720]   They're not going to think of that as,
[01:04:30.720 --> 01:04:32.920]   oh, isn't it horrible that this company
[01:04:32.920 --> 01:04:35.080]   is insisting upon this private information?
[01:04:35.080 --> 01:04:37.360]   They're going to say, oh, Apple, why do I upgrade?
[01:04:37.360 --> 01:04:39.680]   Yeah, my phone was working fine before I upgraded
[01:04:39.680 --> 01:04:41.040]   and now it doesn't work anymore.
[01:04:41.040 --> 01:04:42.960]   And Apple has to always be sensitive to this
[01:04:42.960 --> 01:04:46.200]   while they're trying to work for users best interests.
[01:04:46.200 --> 01:04:47.760]   - I don't find myself that way.
[01:04:47.760 --> 01:04:50.760]   I may be an exception, but usually if an app doesn't work,
[01:04:50.760 --> 01:04:52.360]   I blame the developer no matter what.
[01:04:52.360 --> 01:04:53.680]   (laughing)
[01:04:53.680 --> 01:04:55.600]   It's like, oh, they didn't,
[01:04:55.600 --> 01:04:58.680]   'cause I just feel like they didn't upgrade their libraries.
[01:04:58.680 --> 01:05:01.320]   And so I immediately don't think that.
[01:05:01.320 --> 01:05:03.560]   So I don't know how many people actually think
[01:05:03.560 --> 01:05:05.920]   that it's Apple's fault that they didn't follow.
[01:05:05.920 --> 01:05:07.520]   - All they know is that their phone doesn't do the thing
[01:05:07.520 --> 01:05:09.800]   that was doing fine just two weeks ago.
[01:05:09.800 --> 01:05:10.640]   And they're-- - Or becoming annoying.
[01:05:10.640 --> 01:05:12.280]   - Because it's just cookies.
[01:05:12.280 --> 01:05:13.120]   - Right, exactly.
[01:05:13.120 --> 01:05:15.760]   Yeah, well, I mean, Leo, I've come to really agree
[01:05:15.760 --> 01:05:17.640]   with what Leo was saying earlier on,
[01:05:17.640 --> 01:05:20.040]   where I was a little bit, maybe, when he was talking about,
[01:05:20.040 --> 01:05:23.280]   now that there's the requirement in the EU
[01:05:23.280 --> 01:05:25.000]   and some other places that if you use cookies,
[01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:26.080]   you have to have a little warning saying,
[01:05:26.080 --> 01:05:27.600]   hey, we use cookies, is that okay?
[01:05:27.600 --> 01:05:30.080]   Which was good because it was informed consent,
[01:05:30.080 --> 01:05:31.240]   which is a really good thing.
[01:05:31.240 --> 01:05:33.480]   But how long did it take for you just don't even notice it?
[01:05:33.480 --> 01:05:35.480]   It's like, this stupid thing is in my way
[01:05:35.480 --> 01:05:37.160]   of being able to read the thing that I want to read.
[01:05:37.160 --> 01:05:39.160]   I'm just gonna dismiss it and I don't even know something.
[01:05:39.160 --> 01:05:40.240]   - It's actively annoying.
[01:05:40.240 --> 01:05:41.280]   - Well, my frustration is,
[01:05:41.280 --> 01:05:44.000]   is when they hide it behind an information click.
[01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:46.160]   You know, like I've now gotten to the point where,
[01:05:46.160 --> 01:05:50.000]   if I click on that and I don't get my choices,
[01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:51.440]   immediately I just leave the site,
[01:05:51.440 --> 01:05:52.720]   I'm just like, I'm not gonna play anymore.
[01:05:52.720 --> 01:05:55.800]   Like I just, I just won't, I just won't interact.
[01:05:55.800 --> 01:05:58.320]   Like I'm just like, they're trying to keep me from,
[01:05:58.320 --> 01:06:00.760]   they're trying to give me a little cat and mouse game
[01:06:00.760 --> 01:06:02.560]   of I have to now find it.
[01:06:02.560 --> 01:06:05.160]   So when I click on that ask for release,
[01:06:05.160 --> 01:06:09.520]   I have to, if I don't see the releases on the next click,
[01:06:09.520 --> 01:06:11.640]   like the little buttons, on the next click,
[01:06:11.640 --> 01:06:12.960]   I just won't go to the website.
[01:06:12.960 --> 01:06:15.440]   Like I just, I'm just like, I'm screw you.
[01:06:15.440 --> 01:06:17.040]   Because I know that there be a manipulative,
[01:06:17.040 --> 01:06:18.200]   you know, at that point, they're just playing
[01:06:18.200 --> 01:06:19.160]   this cat and mouse game with me.
[01:06:19.160 --> 01:06:21.400]   And I don't appreciate it.
[01:06:21.400 --> 01:06:25.320]   So, 'cause I think it's under, underhanded.
[01:06:25.320 --> 01:06:27.120]   I'm just tired of being pickpocketed.
[01:06:27.120 --> 01:06:30.880]   - Apple was told about,
[01:06:30.880 --> 01:06:32.680]   this is actually a more complicated story
[01:06:32.680 --> 01:06:34.080]   than it seemed at first,
[01:06:34.080 --> 01:06:39.080]   told about iPhone vulnerabilities by a researcher,
[01:06:39.080 --> 01:06:44.960]   security researcher Denis or Denis Tokerov said,
[01:06:44.960 --> 01:06:48.440]   he told Apple in March and April
[01:06:48.440 --> 01:06:50.400]   of these vulnerabilities.
[01:06:50.400 --> 01:06:51.600]   He heard nothing from Apple.
[01:06:51.600 --> 01:06:53.080]   The last time he heard back from Apple
[01:06:53.080 --> 01:06:55.560]   was August 6th, 12th and 25th.
[01:06:55.560 --> 01:06:58.760]   Then the researcher said he told Apple on September 13th,
[01:06:58.760 --> 01:07:02.000]   he'd publish details unless he heard back.
[01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:04.280]   Finally did go public with it.
[01:07:04.280 --> 01:07:05.720]   Apple fixed one of the flaws,
[01:07:05.720 --> 01:07:06.960]   but without crediting him,
[01:07:06.960 --> 01:07:10.560]   which is against their stated policies for bug reporting.
[01:07:10.560 --> 01:07:15.720]   Apple has responded to Tokerov by saying,
[01:07:15.720 --> 01:07:17.160]   "We saw your blog post."
[01:07:17.160 --> 01:07:19.480]   (laughing)
[01:07:19.480 --> 01:07:20.320]   Whoops.
[01:07:20.320 --> 01:07:21.320]   - Hi.
[01:07:21.320 --> 01:07:23.360]   - We saw your blog post regarding this issue
[01:07:23.360 --> 01:07:24.200]   and your other reports.
[01:07:24.200 --> 01:07:26.840]   We apologize for the delay in responding to you.
[01:07:26.840 --> 01:07:27.680]   We wanna let you know
[01:07:27.680 --> 01:07:30.320]   that we're still investigating these issues
[01:07:30.320 --> 01:07:32.400]   and how we can address them to protect customers.
[01:07:32.400 --> 01:07:34.200]   Thank you again for taking the time.
[01:07:34.200 --> 01:07:35.400]   We appreciate your assistance.
[01:07:35.400 --> 01:07:37.640]   Please let us know if you have any questions.
[01:07:37.640 --> 01:07:39.320]   - Yeah.
[01:07:39.320 --> 01:07:41.600]   - So, there are a couple of issues here.
[01:07:41.600 --> 01:07:44.160]   Number one is just the interpersonal issue
[01:07:44.160 --> 01:07:45.720]   where Apple, according to the,
[01:07:45.720 --> 01:07:47.960]   according to the chain of evidence
[01:07:47.960 --> 01:07:50.760]   that the developer provided,
[01:07:50.760 --> 01:07:51.600]   Apple has actually said,
[01:07:51.600 --> 01:07:54.920]   "We'll absolutely have this done in the next update
[01:07:54.920 --> 01:07:58.280]   and then four software updates, excuse me,
[01:07:58.280 --> 01:08:00.160]   acknowledgement of your contribution,
[01:08:00.160 --> 01:08:02.960]   of your bug will happen in the next one,
[01:08:02.960 --> 01:08:03.800]   happened in the next one,
[01:08:03.800 --> 01:08:05.720]   and one after that, one after that, one after that."
[01:08:05.720 --> 01:08:07.240]   So it was basically, you promised
[01:08:07.240 --> 01:08:09.800]   and you absolutely, you absolutely did not deliver,
[01:08:09.800 --> 01:08:11.960]   but also the question of,
[01:08:11.960 --> 01:08:14.640]   and this is industry-wide,
[01:08:14.640 --> 01:08:17.200]   how much time do you give a company
[01:08:17.200 --> 01:08:19.600]   to respond to a zero day
[01:08:19.600 --> 01:08:20.880]   before you decide that,
[01:08:20.880 --> 01:08:23.600]   "Okay, they have not given me any specific timetable
[01:08:23.600 --> 01:08:25.000]   on when this is going to be fixed.
[01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:28.320]   It is now more important for me to spread the word about this
[01:08:28.320 --> 01:08:29.680]   so that people are aware of the danger."
[01:08:29.680 --> 01:08:31.240]   'Cause normally the idea is,
[01:08:31.240 --> 01:08:33.760]   I think a project zero at Google,
[01:08:33.760 --> 01:08:36.520]   I think they give the company 90 days, I think, to--
[01:08:36.520 --> 01:08:38.080]   - 90 days is the normal.
[01:08:38.080 --> 01:08:41.520]   In fact, it's the industry-wide disclosure window, 90 days.
[01:08:41.520 --> 01:08:43.520]   - So, if you find a zero day.
[01:08:43.520 --> 01:08:46.080]   - If 90, zero day means something,
[01:08:46.080 --> 01:08:47.960]   that you will have total ownership
[01:08:47.960 --> 01:08:49.480]   of the entire device without--
[01:08:49.480 --> 01:08:50.480]   - That's not correct. - Pretty much any more.
[01:08:50.480 --> 01:08:51.320]   - No, that's not correct.
[01:08:51.320 --> 01:08:53.520]   A zero day is something,
[01:08:53.520 --> 01:08:55.280]   the exploit that is discovered
[01:08:55.280 --> 01:08:58.200]   and is already in use at the same time.
[01:08:58.200 --> 01:09:01.040]   That's why it's zero days between discovery and use.
[01:09:01.040 --> 01:09:04.720]   The issue here with disclosure,
[01:09:04.720 --> 01:09:06.800]   and this is, yeah, something everybody in the,
[01:09:06.800 --> 01:09:10.280]   'cause they're, oh, by the way, a lot of businesses now
[01:09:10.280 --> 01:09:12.040]   that spend time finding exploits.
[01:09:12.040 --> 01:09:13.720]   So you have exploits.
[01:09:13.720 --> 01:09:16.680]   They're not zero days unless they're being exploited already.
[01:09:16.680 --> 01:09:18.480]   However, once you reveal the exploit
[01:09:18.480 --> 01:09:19.880]   to the company, the clock is ticking,
[01:09:19.880 --> 01:09:21.800]   and that's reasonable,
[01:09:21.800 --> 01:09:24.720]   because very often companies choose to ignore it,
[01:09:24.720 --> 01:09:26.360]   at which point it's just a matter of time
[01:09:26.360 --> 01:09:28.280]   before bad guys discover it.
[01:09:28.280 --> 01:09:29.840]   And so these security researchers,
[01:09:29.840 --> 01:09:32.400]   I think, completely reasonably say,
[01:09:32.400 --> 01:09:33.520]   we're gonna give you three months,
[01:09:33.520 --> 01:09:35.120]   that's a reasonable amount of time to fix it.
[01:09:35.120 --> 01:09:38.360]   In fact, it's not unusual for a company like Microsoft
[01:09:38.360 --> 01:09:40.360]   to go back to the researchers and say,
[01:09:40.360 --> 01:09:42.440]   look, we wanna fix this, we're working on it,
[01:09:42.440 --> 01:09:43.440]   it's gonna take us more than three months,
[01:09:43.440 --> 01:09:44.840]   and then extending that deadline,
[01:09:44.840 --> 01:09:45.840]   Google's done that, others have done that.
[01:09:45.840 --> 01:09:47.160]   - Or it could also be already being used,
[01:09:47.160 --> 01:09:48.400]   'cause somebody else could have discovered it
[01:09:48.400 --> 01:09:49.240]   and not said anything.
[01:09:49.240 --> 01:09:50.160]   - And that's the problem.
[01:09:50.160 --> 01:09:54.360]   Yeah, as soon as it's found, it's a problem.
[01:09:54.360 --> 01:09:56.280]   And so you really wanna incent companies
[01:09:56.280 --> 01:09:58.800]   to, in a timely fashion, fix it.
[01:09:58.800 --> 01:10:01.720]   Almost every company has an example of them
[01:10:01.720 --> 01:10:04.480]   not fixing a bug that they've been told about.
[01:10:04.480 --> 01:10:06.440]   Microsoft has many.
[01:10:06.440 --> 01:10:08.640]   Apple is a lot better on this, I think.
[01:10:09.560 --> 01:10:12.840]   You know, I'm looking at the vulnerability,
[01:10:12.840 --> 01:10:14.680]   it's a serious vulnerability,
[01:10:14.680 --> 01:10:18.880]   basically it's an app, a malicious app,
[01:10:18.880 --> 01:10:20.400]   so I think Apple also feels like,
[01:10:20.400 --> 01:10:24.560]   well, we know about it, an app would have to get through.
[01:10:24.560 --> 01:10:25.880]   - Which they now know where to look.
[01:10:25.880 --> 01:10:27.800]   - Yeah, they know where to look.
[01:10:27.800 --> 01:10:30.280]   So, I mean, them fixing it immediately
[01:10:30.280 --> 01:10:31.480]   was probably sending out a thing
[01:10:31.480 --> 01:10:33.640]   to all the reviewers for this thing.
[01:10:33.640 --> 01:10:37.160]   You know, and so while we're working on the other side
[01:10:37.160 --> 01:10:40.480]   of that, just don't let anything through this wall.
[01:10:40.480 --> 01:10:43.040]   - So, it's safe to say that, you know,
[01:10:43.040 --> 01:10:46.360]   Steve has railed against Microsoft
[01:10:46.360 --> 01:10:51.040]   for what looks like a willingness to just let flaws go
[01:10:51.040 --> 01:10:54.120]   for ages and ages and ages.
[01:10:54.120 --> 01:10:57.120]   For probably, it's his theory that they do that
[01:10:57.120 --> 01:10:59.320]   for economic reasons.
[01:10:59.320 --> 01:11:03.120]   But he also has a theory that maybe the federal government
[01:11:03.120 --> 01:11:06.200]   has come to them and said, look, we're using that.
[01:11:06.200 --> 01:11:08.840]   We would appreciate you at least for a few months
[01:11:08.840 --> 01:11:10.800]   to put off fixing it.
[01:11:10.800 --> 01:11:13.560]   That also completely, you know,
[01:11:13.560 --> 01:11:16.520]   seems reasonable that that might be happening.
[01:11:16.520 --> 01:11:19.600]   'Cause Microsoft has done that in the past.
[01:11:19.600 --> 01:11:21.600]   Apple seems pretty good about fixing stuff
[01:11:21.600 --> 01:11:23.720]   as quickly as possible.
[01:11:23.720 --> 01:11:26.160]   - Yeah, I mean, for most app developers also,
[01:11:26.160 --> 01:11:29.440]   the quarter that they do, everything slows down,
[01:11:29.440 --> 01:11:32.720]   the quarter, for most platforms and so on and so forth.
[01:11:32.720 --> 01:11:34.320]   If they're making a major upgrade,
[01:11:34.320 --> 01:11:36.480]   the quarter that is before that upgrade
[01:11:36.480 --> 01:11:38.680]   is usually where a lot of things fall through the cracks
[01:11:38.680 --> 01:11:41.960]   because most of their engineering resources are focused on,
[01:11:41.960 --> 01:11:44.080]   you know, getting it out.
[01:11:44.080 --> 01:11:46.400]   And then they switch over to fixing a lot of things
[01:11:46.400 --> 01:11:47.680]   for the next six months.
[01:11:47.680 --> 01:11:49.880]   So, asking for something in May or June
[01:11:49.880 --> 01:11:52.960]   is usually a time when you might get less attention
[01:11:52.960 --> 01:11:55.200]   from Apple because almost all their engineering resources
[01:11:55.200 --> 01:11:57.240]   are focused on the new OS, you know,
[01:11:57.240 --> 01:11:59.720]   and so, you know, 'cause they've announced it,
[01:11:59.720 --> 01:12:01.000]   but they still have to get it out.
[01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:03.440]   And so they're not really, I can imagine,
[01:12:03.440 --> 01:12:05.120]   I don't know this for any, I don't know any fact,
[01:12:05.120 --> 01:12:06.480]   but I can imagine them going,
[01:12:06.480 --> 01:12:09.040]   hey, this isn't that serious a flaw.
[01:12:09.040 --> 01:12:10.720]   We can tell people to look for it and review
[01:12:10.720 --> 01:12:12.480]   and we'll get to it next in the fall.
[01:12:12.480 --> 01:12:13.320]   - Right.
[01:12:13.320 --> 01:12:15.280]   - You know, but then sending that email out
[01:12:15.280 --> 01:12:17.600]   to the developer means they're gonna post it on something,
[01:12:17.600 --> 01:12:19.760]   you know, so that becomes another, you know,
[01:12:19.760 --> 01:12:21.960]   like telling them the way it is,
[01:12:21.960 --> 01:12:24.240]   which is that, hey, we don't have the resources right now
[01:12:24.240 --> 01:12:27.120]   to do that until we get, you know, monoray out
[01:12:27.120 --> 01:12:28.960]   and then we're gonna look back and we're gonna fix it.
[01:12:28.960 --> 01:12:30.880]   They're just gonna post that on a block
[01:12:30.880 --> 01:12:31.920]   as they've proven that they will.
[01:12:31.920 --> 01:12:33.960]   So if they ever thought they were gonna get communication
[01:12:33.960 --> 01:12:36.440]   from Apple before, they can be guaranteed
[01:12:36.440 --> 01:12:38.000]   that they won't get it now.
[01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:40.440]   So other than them sending a really nice email,
[01:12:40.440 --> 01:12:41.960]   but I can tell you internally, I can guess
[01:12:41.960 --> 01:12:43.600]   that that was probably not handled.
[01:12:43.600 --> 01:12:46.360]   That was not thought of as kindly as the email
[01:12:46.360 --> 01:12:47.880]   that he got from Apple.
[01:12:47.880 --> 01:12:51.320]   - He does, Tocorov Data published a follow-up article
[01:12:51.320 --> 01:12:54.320]   in which he says, yeah, you may say that the appster review
[01:12:54.320 --> 01:12:56.440]   is gonna protect you, but here's an example.
[01:12:56.440 --> 01:13:00.000]   Let's say you live in a country where homosexuality
[01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:03.520]   is illegal and in this country they force Apple
[01:13:03.520 --> 01:13:06.120]   to accept a government app, which often happens.
[01:13:06.120 --> 01:13:10.240]   And in that government app, there is this exploit code.
[01:13:10.240 --> 01:13:13.520]   There are, you know, there are plenty examples
[01:13:13.520 --> 01:13:15.760]   of stuff getting through the app store approval process.
[01:13:15.760 --> 01:13:19.720]   So he says, that is not a sufficient defense.
[01:13:19.720 --> 01:13:22.260]   I'll just, you know, you can read his blog posts.
[01:13:22.260 --> 01:13:27.120]   He uses the handle illusion of chaos
[01:13:28.240 --> 01:13:29.960]   if you're searching for them.
[01:13:29.960 --> 01:13:33.440]   And the blog posts are on habrhabber.com.
[01:13:33.440 --> 01:13:39.320]   I think most companies are anxious to fix flaws.
[01:13:39.320 --> 01:13:43.880]   It's just, it just doesn't reflect well on them,
[01:13:43.880 --> 01:13:45.920]   but there are a lot of other considerations
[01:13:45.920 --> 01:13:48.560]   that we don't know about in the timing of that.
[01:13:48.560 --> 01:13:52.240]   - Well, then this is where silence is a real,
[01:13:52.240 --> 01:13:53.560]   real handicap for Apple.
[01:13:53.560 --> 01:13:57.360]   In terms of what their corporate policy is,
[01:13:57.360 --> 01:13:59.960]   that everyone, every corporation has its own culture
[01:13:59.960 --> 01:14:02.640]   that they, has just been developed over decades
[01:14:02.640 --> 01:14:04.280]   that is almost impossible to change.
[01:14:04.280 --> 01:14:06.920]   And I think their default position is that it is,
[01:14:06.920 --> 01:14:10.840]   there are worse repercussions to speaking up
[01:14:10.840 --> 01:14:13.000]   or speaking out or telling people,
[01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:14.400]   giving people explanations,
[01:14:14.400 --> 01:14:16.000]   then there is to simply be quiet,
[01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:17.720]   allow the situation to simply resolve itself
[01:14:17.720 --> 01:14:18.800]   and listen internally.
[01:14:18.800 --> 01:14:21.160]   And this is one of those situations where we can argue
[01:14:21.160 --> 01:14:23.080]   whether what might be going on inside Apple.
[01:14:23.080 --> 01:14:25.160]   And again, they could be, as you say,
[01:14:25.160 --> 01:14:27.640]   in a situation where we have been presented
[01:14:27.640 --> 01:14:30.320]   with a really, really good case by a government
[01:14:30.320 --> 01:14:33.760]   that is important, that this be in the wild for at least,
[01:14:33.760 --> 01:14:35.760]   at least until we open the newspaper
[01:14:35.760 --> 01:14:39.160]   and find out that someplace has been invaded somewhere,
[01:14:39.160 --> 01:14:41.840]   at which point we can do whatever we want with this,
[01:14:41.840 --> 01:14:43.520]   but we can't say anything about it.
[01:14:43.520 --> 01:14:46.200]   But it also means that if you're on the other side
[01:14:46.200 --> 01:14:50.320]   and your entire statement from Apple is Apple had no comment,
[01:14:50.320 --> 01:14:51.800]   you just have to go with what you have.
[01:14:51.800 --> 01:14:52.640]   - Yeah.
[01:14:53.480 --> 01:14:55.240]   - Let's take a little time out, come back,
[01:14:55.240 --> 01:14:56.600]   lots more to talk about.
[01:14:56.600 --> 01:15:01.120]   Andy Inaco, WGBH in Boston, great to have you as always
[01:15:01.120 --> 01:15:06.280]   on the show, Renee Ritchie, YouTube.com/ReneeRitchie.
[01:15:06.280 --> 01:15:11.280]   And of course, Alex Lindsay, officehours.global.
[01:15:11.280 --> 01:15:12.840]   Later in the show, we'll talk a little bit about
[01:15:12.840 --> 01:15:14.760]   what you're up to these days in office hours.
[01:15:14.760 --> 01:15:16.400]   There's always something going on.
[01:15:16.400 --> 01:15:17.760]   - It's always trouble. - Always trouble.
[01:15:17.760 --> 01:15:19.520]   - Always trouble. - You always get in trouble.
[01:15:19.520 --> 01:15:22.120]   I should have brought to you by Cash Fly, literally.
[01:15:22.120 --> 01:15:23.440]   Brought to you by Cash Fly.
[01:15:23.440 --> 01:15:26.880]   It's Twitch's content delivery network.
[01:15:26.880 --> 01:15:31.360]   Many others too, Cash Fly's been doing this since 1999.
[01:15:31.360 --> 01:15:34.600]   We've been working with them since practically the beginning
[01:15:34.600 --> 01:15:38.360]   because we needed a way to get closer to our listeners.
[01:15:38.360 --> 01:15:41.080]   Cash Fly's 50 points of presence
[01:15:41.080 --> 01:15:42.920]   are distributed all over the world,
[01:15:42.920 --> 01:15:45.880]   which means if you're listening, downloading a show
[01:15:45.880 --> 01:15:47.640]   or watching the stream on the website,
[01:15:47.640 --> 01:15:50.680]   you're watching it not from our origin point
[01:15:50.680 --> 01:15:51.920]   here in Northern California,
[01:15:51.920 --> 01:15:54.400]   but you're watching it from a server close to you.
[01:15:54.400 --> 01:15:57.080]   That means it's faster, that means it works better,
[01:15:57.080 --> 01:15:58.480]   that means there's fewer interruptions.
[01:15:58.480 --> 01:16:02.640]   It also saves us a ton of money serving that content.
[01:16:02.640 --> 01:16:04.480]   Now Cash Fly's added a new feature.
[01:16:04.480 --> 01:16:07.160]   They call it ultra low latency streaming.
[01:16:07.160 --> 01:16:08.880]   And wow, is this amazing.
[01:16:08.880 --> 01:16:11.880]   Less than a second stream delay.
[01:16:11.880 --> 01:16:13.560]   That's amazing latency.
[01:16:13.560 --> 01:16:15.480]   I'm not talking webRTC here.
[01:16:15.480 --> 01:16:17.200]   This is something Cash Fly's done.
[01:16:17.200 --> 01:16:19.520]   That's very, very exciting.
[01:16:19.520 --> 01:16:22.920]   Their HTML5 player comes with the SDK
[01:16:22.920 --> 01:16:26.160]   so you could put it in anything that you want it
[01:16:26.160 --> 01:16:30.280]   to run on websites, applications, mobile devices.
[01:16:30.280 --> 01:16:33.040]   Because they're global, your video streams,
[01:16:33.040 --> 01:16:35.240]   this is how you do ultra low latency streaming.
[01:16:35.240 --> 01:16:37.920]   They'll be streaming quickly anywhere you have viewers,
[01:16:37.920 --> 01:16:39.240]   regardless of the continent.
[01:16:39.240 --> 01:16:41.200]   They're on, they just added a bunch of points of presence
[01:16:41.200 --> 01:16:44.280]   in South America and they're all over the world.
[01:16:44.280 --> 01:16:49.080]   It's, the scaling is also kind of mind boggling.
[01:16:49.080 --> 01:16:51.240]   Cash Fly's ultra low latency video platform
[01:16:51.240 --> 01:16:54.280]   can deliver video to more than a million users
[01:16:54.280 --> 01:16:55.560]   at the same time.
[01:16:55.560 --> 01:17:00.560]   They can ingest thousands of synchronous streams.
[01:17:00.560 --> 01:17:03.360]   Their platforms designed for transmuxing,
[01:17:03.360 --> 01:17:05.920]   thousands of streams simultaneously.
[01:17:05.920 --> 01:17:10.360]   With live failover, they can ingest RTMP, RTMP, SRT
[01:17:10.360 --> 01:17:13.960]   and more to deliver an ultra low latency SLDP and HLS streams.
[01:17:13.960 --> 01:17:16.320]   And they can do that all at the same time,
[01:17:16.320 --> 01:17:17.960]   which is very impressive.
[01:17:17.960 --> 01:17:20.760]   And one of the things we love about Cash Fly is
[01:17:20.760 --> 01:17:24.480]   they will tailor their solution to fit your needs.
[01:17:24.480 --> 01:17:28.800]   Just bring your usage trends, your bills to cashfly.com,
[01:17:28.800 --> 01:17:30.640]   let them put something together for you.
[01:17:30.640 --> 01:17:33.320]   And that support, we've always been very happy
[01:17:33.320 --> 01:17:37.160]   with 24/7, 365 days a year.
[01:17:37.160 --> 01:17:39.280]   Cash Fly's infrastructure can support more than
[01:17:39.280 --> 01:17:41.920]   a million concurrent streams today.
[01:17:41.920 --> 01:17:46.360]   And because they're the world's most reliable CDN,
[01:17:46.360 --> 01:17:49.800]   they're backed by a 100% SLA.
[01:17:49.800 --> 01:17:51.240]   (laughs)
[01:17:51.240 --> 01:17:52.280]   That's a lot of nines.
[01:17:52.280 --> 01:17:54.760]   One, that's an infinite number of nines.
[01:17:54.760 --> 01:17:59.760]   100% up to five times faster than other CDNs.
[01:17:59.760 --> 01:18:03.160]   Cash Fly, bring your bill, bring your usage trends,
[01:18:03.160 --> 01:18:05.520]   see if you're overpaying by 20% or more.
[01:18:05.520 --> 01:18:07.440]   Find out what Cash Fly can do for you.
[01:18:07.440 --> 01:18:09.680]   We've got a very nice place to go.
[01:18:09.680 --> 01:18:13.280]   No pressure, no high pressure sales, just information.
[01:18:13.280 --> 01:18:16.560]   twit.cashfly.com, you'll really like them.
[01:18:16.560 --> 01:18:19.360]   And I can say that from personal experience.
[01:18:19.360 --> 01:18:24.040]   twit.cashfly.com for a complimentary detail analysis
[01:18:24.040 --> 01:18:26.440]   of your current CDN bill and usage trends,
[01:18:26.440 --> 01:18:29.560]   twit.cashfly.com.
[01:18:29.560 --> 01:18:33.880]   We thank them so much for making Mac break weekly possible.
[01:18:33.880 --> 01:18:38.880]   iPhone 13 Tare Down is in from the folks that I fix it.
[01:18:40.720 --> 01:18:44.880]   A15 Bionic, SOC 5-core GPU, all the stuff we knew.
[01:18:44.880 --> 01:18:48.080]   Were there any surprises in here, Renee?
[01:18:48.080 --> 01:18:50.520]   Did you see anything you didn't know about?
[01:18:50.520 --> 01:18:54.000]   No, I think it's interesting the way they relayed out
[01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:56.400]   everything and the way they fit the bigger batteries in there
[01:18:56.400 --> 01:18:58.000]   and the L-shape, I always like L-shape batteries
[01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:01.320]   on the pro units, but I think it's an iPhone.
[01:19:01.320 --> 01:19:03.040]   And I mean that it's both like,
[01:19:03.040 --> 01:19:04.200]   that's a compliment at this point.
[01:19:04.200 --> 01:19:07.520]   It's like an Omega watch or a Porsche 911 or a Leica,
[01:19:07.520 --> 01:19:09.480]   Leica Leica, Leica camera.
[01:19:09.480 --> 01:19:11.280]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:19:11.280 --> 01:19:14.080]   Of course, yeah, I like the L-shape battery.
[01:19:14.080 --> 01:19:15.720]   That's the biggest takeaway on this.
[01:19:15.720 --> 01:19:16.760]   Whoops, there you go.
[01:19:16.760 --> 01:19:18.640]   And the cameras are huge, like we knew that,
[01:19:18.640 --> 01:19:19.480]   but they're still huge.
[01:19:19.480 --> 01:19:21.400]   Yeah, ginormous.
[01:19:21.400 --> 01:19:23.320]   You know, actually I'm kind of surprised.
[01:19:23.320 --> 01:19:26.520]   You would think, given everything we hear about iPhones,
[01:19:26.520 --> 01:19:29.200]   the repairability would be down to around one or two.
[01:19:29.200 --> 01:19:31.480]   But actually it's five out of 10.
[01:19:31.480 --> 01:19:36.480]   Most, you can replace battery and display.
[01:19:36.480 --> 01:19:39.080]   Apple continues to prioritize that.
[01:19:39.080 --> 01:19:42.760]   Most other components are modular and easy to access or replace.
[01:19:42.760 --> 01:19:44.240]   It says I fix it.
[01:19:44.240 --> 01:19:48.200]   Lots of screws, but they're not glue, that's good.
[01:19:48.200 --> 01:19:50.640]   They also say, and I think this makes sense,
[01:19:50.640 --> 01:19:53.760]   waterproofing methods complicate summer pairs,
[01:19:53.760 --> 01:19:56.020]   but make water damage less likely.
[01:19:56.020 --> 01:20:01.360]   So, you know, the rear glass is always gonna be
[01:20:01.360 --> 01:20:02.680]   an issue in iPhones.
[01:20:02.680 --> 01:20:06.720]   It's something Apple chooses to put on for aesthetics.
[01:20:06.720 --> 01:20:07.560]   I don't think there's a--
[01:20:07.560 --> 01:20:08.560]   Well, I'm talking of charging.
[01:20:08.560 --> 01:20:10.000]   Oh, and charging, yeah.
[01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:10.840]   You can't put metal in there.
[01:20:10.840 --> 01:20:12.920]   Yeah, Qualcomm has a patent through metal charging,
[01:20:12.920 --> 01:20:14.160]   but it's not very efficient.
[01:20:14.160 --> 01:20:17.440]   Yeah, but you know, I get antennas are more efficient.
[01:20:17.440 --> 01:20:20.160]   Silicon case, yeah, works fine.
[01:20:20.160 --> 01:20:24.320]   MagSafe goes right through it, and it protects that,
[01:20:24.320 --> 01:20:26.280]   so there's ways to do that.
[01:20:26.280 --> 01:20:30.400]   So, a good, you know, I always love their tear downs.
[01:20:30.400 --> 01:20:32.240]   As you said, there's not a whole lot
[01:20:32.240 --> 01:20:35.240]   that we didn't know about this, but pretty interesting.
[01:20:35.240 --> 01:20:36.080]   At least, at least, at least,
[01:20:36.080 --> 01:20:38.800]   earlier, they're not malicious about it.
[01:20:38.800 --> 01:20:39.920]   Go ahead, Andy, and then Renee.
[01:20:39.920 --> 01:20:41.320]   I think, I think Renee was about to say
[01:20:41.320 --> 01:20:42.160]   exactly what I was going to say,
[01:20:42.160 --> 01:20:43.520]   and he'll probably say it better, so go ahead.
[01:20:43.520 --> 01:20:45.440]   Okay, go ahead, Renee.
[01:20:45.440 --> 01:20:47.600]   No, no, I was just gonna say, maybe not,
[01:20:47.600 --> 01:20:49.440]   but I was just gonna say it's your previous point.
[01:20:49.440 --> 01:20:50.640]   They're doing what's best for Apple
[01:20:50.640 --> 01:20:51.920]   and for Apple repair centers,
[01:20:51.920 --> 01:20:53.440]   and sometimes that makes them more repairable
[01:20:53.440 --> 01:20:55.520]   because the machine that swaps out the screens
[01:20:55.520 --> 01:20:57.720]   at the Apple Retail Center this year happens
[01:20:57.720 --> 01:21:00.360]   to be way easier to use for everybody than it was last year.
[01:21:00.360 --> 01:21:02.400]   And sometimes they're not very good at waterproofing yet,
[01:21:02.400 --> 01:21:05.120]   and they get way better at waterproofing in years past,
[01:21:05.120 --> 01:21:07.520]   and sometimes glue is just the only way to solve a problem
[01:21:07.520 --> 01:21:09.600]   that they have, or the cheapest way to solve a problem
[01:21:09.600 --> 01:21:10.440]   that they have.
[01:21:10.440 --> 01:21:12.840]   So it's mostly a purely functional company,
[01:21:12.840 --> 01:21:14.600]   which in some ways is understandable,
[01:21:14.600 --> 01:21:16.120]   in some ways is terrifying.
[01:21:16.120 --> 01:21:19.840]   I know you get the corporate briefings, Renee,
[01:21:19.840 --> 01:21:22.960]   and we benefit from that, so thank you.
[01:21:22.960 --> 01:21:27.960]   GQUK got a conversation with John McCormack,
[01:21:27.960 --> 01:21:31.440]   who's VP of camera software engineering at Graham Townsend,
[01:21:31.440 --> 01:21:34.360]   VP of camera hardware engineering.
[01:21:34.360 --> 01:21:37.040]   I thought there were some very interesting tidbits in here.
[01:21:37.040 --> 01:21:41.480]   800 engineers working on the cameras at Apple.
[01:21:41.480 --> 01:21:44.280]   - Yeah, it's a big deal. - 800.
[01:21:44.280 --> 01:21:47.600]   Townsend said the planning has to start three years ahead
[01:21:47.600 --> 01:21:50.200]   because that's when the spec is fixed.
[01:21:50.200 --> 01:21:52.360]   So that's when the sensors defined,
[01:21:52.360 --> 01:21:55.120]   that's when the processors frozen, processors frozen.
[01:21:55.120 --> 01:21:59.640]   2018 was when this was all locked in.
[01:21:59.640 --> 01:22:02.160]   That's really a long timeframe.
[01:22:02.160 --> 01:22:03.000]   I wonder if Apple--
[01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:03.840]   - It's crazy to think about it.
[01:22:03.840 --> 01:22:06.520]   - Stuff about Apple, not like people left
[01:22:06.520 --> 01:22:08.040]   and so things weren't the way they should.
[01:22:08.040 --> 01:22:09.480]   This was all done three years ago.
[01:22:09.480 --> 01:22:11.080]   - Yeah, exactly.
[01:22:11.080 --> 01:22:12.520]   You'd think they'd wanna speed that up,
[01:22:12.520 --> 01:22:14.440]   but it must be that they can't--
[01:22:14.440 --> 01:22:15.560]   - It just takes time.
[01:22:15.560 --> 01:22:16.400]   It just takes time.
[01:22:16.400 --> 01:22:18.000]   It's a really complicated thing.
[01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:19.320]   - And it's very novel stuff.
[01:22:19.320 --> 01:22:22.200]   When you talk about things like Face ID the first time,
[01:22:22.200 --> 01:22:24.040]   when you talk about things like cinematic about this time,
[01:22:24.040 --> 01:22:25.160]   it's new and novel stuff,
[01:22:25.160 --> 01:22:27.760]   and they actually went out with cinematographers and studied.
[01:22:27.760 --> 01:22:30.480]   It's not a quick process for them.
[01:22:32.440 --> 01:22:37.440]   They quote, "Kai-an-drance VP of worldwide iPhone product marketing."
[01:22:37.440 --> 01:22:41.120]   There's always this obsession with,
[01:22:41.120 --> 01:22:43.200]   and this confirms what we were thinking last week.
[01:22:43.200 --> 01:22:44.880]   How do we make this really easy to use
[01:22:44.880 --> 01:22:47.640]   if you're not a trained photographer,
[01:22:47.640 --> 01:22:50.920]   but you just love taking photos?
[01:22:50.920 --> 01:22:51.880]   This is interesting.
[01:22:51.880 --> 01:22:52.680]   I mean, that makes sense.
[01:22:52.680 --> 01:22:54.760]   That's the focus, although they admit
[01:22:54.760 --> 01:22:58.040]   that they were very aware of TikTok
[01:22:58.040 --> 01:23:00.160]   as they worked on this.
[01:23:00.160 --> 01:23:02.000]   And filmmakers.
[01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:03.000]   - Okay.
[01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:04.480]   - There was this really great part,
[01:23:04.480 --> 01:23:05.880]   because it's the same people were interviewed
[01:23:05.880 --> 01:23:07.120]   in Tyler Solomon's podcast.
[01:23:07.120 --> 01:23:09.440]   And one of the things that John said was,
[01:23:09.440 --> 01:23:13.160]   he's a traditional, like, boots-on-the-ground animal photographer.
[01:23:13.160 --> 01:23:14.000]   He's on Instagram.
[01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:16.080]   His photos are beyond amazing.
[01:23:16.080 --> 01:23:19.560]   But he's like, "I will mask and expose individual parts,
[01:23:19.560 --> 01:23:21.920]   "like the teeth, the eyes, the face, the background,
[01:23:21.920 --> 01:23:23.080]   "the thing.
[01:23:23.080 --> 01:23:25.720]   "We'll go into the dark room and we'll do all these things."
[01:23:25.720 --> 01:23:28.120]   And it's years and years of experience as a photographer,
[01:23:28.120 --> 01:23:30.400]   but when we create things like Smart HDR4,
[01:23:30.400 --> 01:23:31.720]   the machine learning algorithm,
[01:23:31.720 --> 01:23:32.720]   we're trying to do that.
[01:23:32.720 --> 01:23:34.360]   We're doing all this semantic rendering.
[01:23:34.360 --> 01:23:35.960]   We're doing all this in the camera.
[01:23:35.960 --> 01:23:38.760]   And you don't have to be someone with 20 years
[01:23:38.760 --> 01:23:41.400]   of photography experience to know how to mask everything
[01:23:41.400 --> 01:23:43.720]   and expose and process it separately.
[01:23:43.720 --> 01:23:45.120]   We're doing all that for you.
[01:23:45.120 --> 01:23:47.640]   So it's giving you that sort of learning in the box,
[01:23:47.640 --> 01:23:51.160]   which is, again, also great but terrifying at the same time.
[01:23:51.160 --> 01:23:53.640]   - We always talk about these deeply technical things,
[01:23:53.640 --> 01:23:57.080]   like ProRes, like how much data throughput is gonna happen.
[01:23:57.080 --> 01:23:57.920]   What can you do?
[01:23:57.920 --> 01:24:00.440]   Can you shoot real cinematic movies with it?
[01:24:00.440 --> 01:24:02.440]   But every single engineer, number one thing
[01:24:02.440 --> 01:24:03.760]   on the whiteboard is always,
[01:24:03.760 --> 01:24:07.400]   someone takes out a phone, they get a picture
[01:24:07.400 --> 01:24:09.680]   with as little fuss and little delay as possible.
[01:24:09.680 --> 01:24:12.040]   It's like, it's all about that one button press.
[01:24:12.040 --> 01:24:14.720]   Now, how long does it take to light up that phone app?
[01:24:14.720 --> 01:24:18.040]   How long does it take for the screen to compose?
[01:24:18.040 --> 01:24:20.680]   How long does it take between the time that button is pressed
[01:24:20.680 --> 01:24:22.800]   between the images captured?
[01:24:22.800 --> 01:24:25.360]   And how good an image can we do without the person
[01:24:25.360 --> 01:24:27.640]   having to do anything whatsoever?
[01:24:27.640 --> 01:24:32.640]   And that is, again, I love my semi-Pro Olympus camera.
[01:24:32.640 --> 01:24:34.760]   It's a really impressive piece of engineering,
[01:24:34.760 --> 01:24:36.480]   what it can do in this little small package.
[01:24:36.480 --> 01:24:39.880]   But consistently, the biggest problems are,
[01:24:39.880 --> 01:24:42.920]   this is like Apollo 13 every single day,
[01:24:42.920 --> 01:24:44.840]   figuring out how to make one button press
[01:24:44.840 --> 01:24:47.840]   do as much as possible without screwing up
[01:24:47.840 --> 01:24:49.520]   getting your capture right.
[01:24:49.520 --> 01:24:50.920]   - Well, in fact, to that point,
[01:24:50.920 --> 01:24:54.280]   there's a great quote from Townsend.
[01:24:55.560 --> 01:24:58.120]   "When he's trying to tell the teams
[01:24:58.120 --> 01:25:00.120]   what they're doing is important,
[01:25:00.120 --> 01:25:01.520]   he says the way I explain it to the team
[01:25:01.520 --> 01:25:02.720]   to keep motivated every year is,
[01:25:02.720 --> 01:25:05.040]   we have a remarkable responsibility.
[01:25:05.040 --> 01:25:09.400]   We have a privilege to help capture precious moments
[01:25:09.400 --> 01:25:11.760]   that people aren't even expecting to happen.
[01:25:11.760 --> 01:25:13.480]   And so they really, I think they treat this
[01:25:13.480 --> 01:25:15.880]   as a kind of a holy mission almost.
[01:25:15.880 --> 01:25:17.720]   - I mean, the vast majority,
[01:25:17.720 --> 01:25:19.680]   I mean, I definitely take photos with nicer cameras
[01:25:19.680 --> 01:25:22.880]   than the iPhone, but the vast majority, 99%
[01:25:22.880 --> 01:25:25.280]   of all the pictures I have of my kids are from my phone.
[01:25:25.280 --> 01:25:26.120]   - Yeah.
[01:25:26.120 --> 01:25:29.840]   - And can I say, as someone who often has both an iPhone
[01:25:29.840 --> 01:25:31.840]   and an Android phone in their pocket at all times,
[01:25:31.840 --> 01:25:33.960]   consistently, it's not just the quality,
[01:25:33.960 --> 01:25:35.840]   it's not really the quality of the picture so much
[01:25:35.840 --> 01:25:38.640]   as the reliability that I envy about the iPhone.
[01:25:38.640 --> 01:25:41.600]   Like there's something, I saw an animal
[01:25:41.600 --> 01:25:43.160]   that I wanted to get a picture of,
[01:25:43.160 --> 01:25:45.520]   and I tried to take a picture and I got an interruption
[01:25:45.520 --> 01:25:49.720]   from the tile app saying,
[01:25:49.720 --> 01:25:51.520]   "Oh, it seems as though you left the house
[01:25:51.520 --> 01:25:53.400]   without your key, without your bag.
[01:25:53.400 --> 01:25:55.160]   Like, I don't care.
[01:25:55.160 --> 01:25:56.080]   Was this useful?"
[01:25:56.080 --> 01:25:57.360]   No, it wasn't useful.
[01:25:57.360 --> 01:25:59.000]   Oh, great, I'll close down the camera app
[01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:00.200]   and take you to the tile app.
[01:26:00.200 --> 01:26:02.640]   So you can tell us more about how we made you angry
[01:26:02.640 --> 01:26:05.480]   because we interrupted your day with an unnecessary,
[01:26:05.480 --> 01:26:07.360]   and of course, the animal, the squirrel,
[01:26:07.360 --> 01:26:09.000]   whatever is already long, long gone.
[01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:11.120]   And this is the sort of stuff that doesn't happen
[01:26:11.120 --> 01:26:12.520]   on an iPhone device.
[01:26:12.520 --> 01:26:14.840]   Even when it's an interaction with a third party app,
[01:26:14.840 --> 01:26:16.760]   they really get this thing on lock.
[01:26:16.760 --> 01:26:19.560]   So this is one of the most human things that Apple does
[01:26:19.560 --> 01:26:21.520]   is making sure that when something happens
[01:26:21.520 --> 01:26:22.400]   and you wanna get a picture of it,
[01:26:22.400 --> 01:26:24.160]   you will get a picture of it.
[01:26:24.160 --> 01:26:28.720]   It's interesting, they're also kind of aware of filmmakers.
[01:26:28.720 --> 01:26:30.560]   You wouldn't think that they would,
[01:26:30.560 --> 01:26:33.800]   I mean, for all the attention and the ads and everything,
[01:26:33.800 --> 01:26:35.200]   you wouldn't think that they really would think
[01:26:35.200 --> 01:26:36.760]   that that's a serious part of their market,
[01:26:36.760 --> 01:26:38.880]   but apparently it is.
[01:26:38.880 --> 01:26:40.880]   Well, when we think about filmmakers,
[01:26:40.880 --> 01:26:43.200]   we wanna remember that what they're really looking at,
[01:26:43.200 --> 01:26:45.440]   I think more than filmmakers are the people
[01:26:45.440 --> 01:26:47.920]   who are making training videos, the TikTokers,
[01:26:47.920 --> 01:26:50.080]   the YouTubers, the Vimeo folks,
[01:26:50.080 --> 01:26:52.040]   all these other social networks
[01:26:52.040 --> 01:26:54.760]   is the thing is that Kodak gave film
[01:26:54.760 --> 01:26:56.320]   for a long time to filmmakers,
[01:26:56.320 --> 01:26:59.680]   so that because the people making independent films
[01:26:59.680 --> 01:27:02.480]   and all the other things want to aspire towards that.
[01:27:02.480 --> 01:27:05.200]   So it's not necessarily that they're targeting filmmakers
[01:27:05.200 --> 01:27:06.680]   as much as they are targeting people
[01:27:06.680 --> 01:27:08.880]   who aspire to be a filmmaker,
[01:27:08.880 --> 01:27:11.680]   that they could actually create something
[01:27:11.680 --> 01:27:14.160]   at that quality without a further investment.
[01:27:14.160 --> 01:27:16.360]   They do quote an actual filmmaker,
[01:27:16.360 --> 01:27:20.440]   director Ben Wheatley, who used multiple iPhone 12s
[01:27:20.440 --> 01:27:23.480]   in the production of his most recent movie in the earth
[01:27:23.480 --> 01:27:27.760]   and Wheatley says, "The problem is that an area like says
[01:27:27.760 --> 01:27:32.760]   100,000 pounds, so having a piece of kit you can chuck about
[01:27:32.760 --> 01:27:37.520]   and not worry about roughing up is increasingly valuable.
[01:27:37.520 --> 01:27:40.560]   What I want is to be able to use a camera like a pen
[01:27:40.560 --> 01:27:43.400]   or a brush and it's getting closer to be able to do that
[01:27:43.400 --> 01:27:45.160]   without it looking really crappy.
[01:27:45.160 --> 01:27:47.520]   The fact that these phones can spit out 4K,
[01:27:47.520 --> 01:27:49.160]   everything is so much better.
[01:27:49.160 --> 01:27:51.480]   It's good PR.
[01:27:51.480 --> 01:27:53.200]   Like I just want to cut into that just a little bit.
[01:27:53.200 --> 01:27:54.040]   - Okay, good, please.
[01:27:54.040 --> 01:27:57.600]   - So what's typically used as a crash camera
[01:27:57.600 --> 01:28:02.600]   when using an airy is a Blackmagic 6K, which is $2,000.
[01:28:02.600 --> 01:28:05.120]   So he's absolutely right.
[01:28:05.120 --> 01:28:06.760]   Yeah, so the 6Ks are crap.
[01:28:06.760 --> 01:28:08.360]   My brother is a steady cam off.
[01:28:08.360 --> 01:28:10.080]   And he's like, "Yeah, they look great.
[01:28:10.080 --> 01:28:11.200]   They were great as crash cameras."
[01:28:11.200 --> 01:28:12.360]   And so--
[01:28:12.360 --> 01:28:14.360]   - You're not gonna use an iPhone for that.
[01:28:14.360 --> 01:28:15.680]   - They're not gonna use an iPhone for that.
[01:28:15.680 --> 01:28:16.520]   They're gonna use,
[01:28:16.520 --> 01:28:18.280]   so that's a little bit of,
[01:28:18.280 --> 01:28:21.200]   like, now what the iPhone is nice for is it's really compact
[01:28:21.200 --> 01:28:22.960]   and it's really easy and you can just stick it in there
[01:28:22.960 --> 01:28:23.960]   and there isn't a lot of setup.
[01:28:23.960 --> 01:28:25.760]   And if you're just trying to pick up a couple of shots,
[01:28:25.760 --> 01:28:26.560]   it might be useful.
[01:28:26.560 --> 01:28:30.560]   We've used it in productions because we needed to.
[01:28:30.560 --> 01:28:33.280]   And so there have been reasons that we've done that,
[01:28:33.280 --> 01:28:36.280]   but it's a little inauthentic to say that I,
[01:28:36.280 --> 01:28:41.640]   the areas is $110,000.
[01:28:41.640 --> 01:28:44.000]   So I used an iPhone when there's,
[01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:46.760]   you can get a 12K Blackmagic for 6K,
[01:28:46.760 --> 01:28:49.800]   for 2 grand and those are gonna give you
[01:28:49.800 --> 01:28:52.840]   much higher quality images than the iPhone.
[01:28:52.840 --> 01:28:54.000]   - Well, but it's not just the camera.
[01:28:54.000 --> 01:28:56.240]   You gotta put a lens on it too.
[01:28:56.240 --> 01:28:57.600]   - Still, I mean it's still--
[01:28:57.600 --> 01:28:58.440]   - It's crash lens.
[01:28:58.440 --> 01:29:01.360]   - If I put a 500 dollar lens on,
[01:29:01.360 --> 01:29:06.280]   if I take a $500 lens and put it onto a $2,000 Blackmagic,
[01:29:06.280 --> 01:29:10.400]   I got a $2,500 camera that is going to look way better
[01:29:10.400 --> 01:29:11.240]   than an iPhone.
[01:29:11.240 --> 01:29:12.720]   Like, I love the iPhone.
[01:29:12.720 --> 01:29:13.960]   I shoot tons of stuff with the iPhone,
[01:29:13.960 --> 01:29:16.520]   but we just wanna keep it in the area
[01:29:16.520 --> 01:29:17.880]   of what it really is good at.
[01:29:17.880 --> 01:29:19.280]   - That's why we ask you.
[01:29:19.280 --> 01:29:20.480]   - Nope, yeah, we want to--
[01:29:20.480 --> 01:29:22.600]   - I've heard that it's been opportunistically
[01:29:22.600 --> 01:29:24.560]   snuck its way into some big productions
[01:29:24.560 --> 01:29:27.720]   was either they captured something as a test
[01:29:27.720 --> 01:29:29.800]   and it ended up looking better than what they captured.
[01:29:29.800 --> 01:29:31.560]   Very, very short, of course, like one or two seconds,
[01:29:31.560 --> 01:29:33.040]   or they could put it in a place
[01:29:33.040 --> 01:29:34.760]   where they just couldn't fit whatever they had planned
[01:29:34.760 --> 01:29:36.280]   for the day and it was like an emerging situation
[01:29:36.280 --> 01:29:37.200]   and they got there,
[01:29:37.200 --> 01:29:39.160]   there are three to four seconds of a shot that they needed.
[01:29:39.160 --> 01:29:41.380]   And so there, in some really big movies,
[01:29:41.380 --> 01:29:43.000]   there are a few seconds of iPhone stuff
[01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:44.080]   that is snuck its way in.
[01:29:44.080 --> 01:29:44.920]   - And that's where the-- - And that's where
[01:29:44.920 --> 01:29:45.760]   the fact-- - And that's where
[01:29:45.760 --> 01:29:47.680]   the fact-- - How was second unit,
[01:29:47.680 --> 01:29:49.080]   there's a famous story about how a second unit
[01:29:49.080 --> 01:29:52.800]   camera operator on a Martin Scorsese movie said,
[01:29:52.800 --> 01:29:56.200]   "Oh, basically, he wanted to show Scorsese
[01:29:56.200 --> 01:29:58.680]   the kind of shot he wanted to insert on a plane."
[01:29:58.680 --> 01:30:00.920]   Like, just he needed a shot of like the no smoking sign
[01:30:00.920 --> 01:30:02.600]   or go back to your seat sign going on.
[01:30:02.600 --> 01:30:04.040]   So while I was on a flight, he just shot this
[01:30:04.040 --> 01:30:06.080]   with his iPhone or whatever and just sent it to him.
[01:30:06.080 --> 01:30:07.720]   "Oh, by the way, this is what I'm gonna put in."
[01:30:07.720 --> 01:30:09.360]   And he said, "Oh, well, no, too late.
[01:30:09.360 --> 01:30:10.680]   "I've actually put it in, it's fine.
[01:30:10.680 --> 01:30:12.080]   "It works fine, let's put it in."
[01:30:12.080 --> 01:30:14.240]   - Just feel like that.
[01:30:14.240 --> 01:30:17.560]   - So I don't know, we'll take it with a grain of salt,
[01:30:17.560 --> 01:30:22.240]   DXL Mark, as you know, every year, looks at the iPhone.
[01:30:22.240 --> 01:30:27.240]   This year ranked it with 137 points
[01:30:27.240 --> 01:30:29.280]   that does not put it at the top of the list.
[01:30:29.280 --> 01:30:33.400]   That puts it fourth, but pretty close to the top.
[01:30:33.400 --> 01:30:35.720]   - Apple chooses not to pay DXO to consult
[01:30:35.720 --> 01:30:36.920]   how they do better on DXO.
[01:30:36.920 --> 01:30:39.000]   - Oh, that's interesting, okay.
[01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:40.680]   Huawei, apparently, doesn't mind,
[01:30:40.680 --> 01:30:42.440]   nor does Xiaomi get there.
[01:30:42.440 --> 01:30:43.840]   - I just always have an issue with companies
[01:30:43.840 --> 01:30:45.240]   that have consulting and rankings.
[01:30:45.240 --> 01:30:47.720]   Like those that would be completely separate for me.
[01:30:47.720 --> 01:30:50.360]   - And I have to say that it is really,
[01:30:50.360 --> 01:30:52.560]   the Apple ProRes is going to be a big deal
[01:30:52.560 --> 01:30:54.280]   for anyone who's that serious,
[01:30:54.280 --> 01:30:55.880]   that they're gonna look at a DXO,
[01:30:55.880 --> 01:31:00.880]   is that understanding they can actually capture real data
[01:31:00.880 --> 01:31:04.960]   that they can actually use on the phone is a big deal.
[01:31:04.960 --> 01:31:07.640]   Like no one's gonna think about other phones to do that,
[01:31:07.640 --> 01:31:09.120]   if one's ProRes is available,
[01:31:09.120 --> 01:31:11.360]   because all the other phones will record
[01:31:11.360 --> 01:31:15.360]   in some weird H.264 or H.265 compression,
[01:31:15.360 --> 01:31:17.160]   then it's not gonna be anywhere near ProRes.
[01:31:17.160 --> 01:31:19.720]   And that is a killer feature.
[01:31:19.720 --> 01:31:21.080]   Like there are certain features that you look at,
[01:31:21.080 --> 01:31:25.640]   like, oh, like that is a must have feature for them.
[01:31:25.640 --> 01:31:27.520]   So I think that that's gonna be,
[01:31:27.520 --> 01:31:29.880]   that annihilates pretty much everything.
[01:31:29.880 --> 01:31:32.240]   If you're doing anything that's remotely valuable
[01:31:32.240 --> 01:31:35.080]   on your phone, the ProRes codec.
[01:31:35.080 --> 01:31:36.920]   - We're a photographer photographers.
[01:31:36.920 --> 01:31:39.400]   - Yeah, and so those things are, you know,
[01:31:39.400 --> 01:31:41.760]   that really sets them apart from every other phone,
[01:31:41.760 --> 01:31:44.000]   regardless of the sensor score.
[01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:45.960]   - Have you been having trouble anybody
[01:31:45.960 --> 01:31:50.080]   with your iPhone 13 and the unlock with Apple Watch
[01:31:50.080 --> 01:31:50.920]   feature?
[01:31:50.920 --> 01:31:54.000]   Apparently some are and Apple says yes,
[01:31:54.000 --> 01:31:57.160]   and it will be fixed in an upcoming update.
[01:31:57.160 --> 01:31:58.360]   - Mine is different.
[01:31:58.360 --> 01:32:00.920]   And again, this is like an inside baseball story,
[01:32:00.920 --> 01:32:02.040]   but when you set up four phones,
[01:32:02.040 --> 01:32:03.040]   anytime you set up the phone,
[01:32:03.040 --> 01:32:05.280]   the last few tries to take over your watch.
[01:32:05.280 --> 01:32:07.120]   So now like the, I think the mini or something
[01:32:07.120 --> 01:32:08.280]   is paired with my watch,
[01:32:08.280 --> 01:32:10.000]   and I don't use the mini as much as the other ones.
[01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:12.440]   So if I take a different phone, I can't unlock,
[01:32:12.440 --> 01:32:14.760]   I have to go and reinstall all of them.
[01:32:14.760 --> 01:32:16.440]   - This is what we said.
[01:32:16.440 --> 01:32:18.840]   - Take my phone, 'cause I bought her the 13.
[01:32:18.840 --> 01:32:21.640]   She said, take my phone and review it for a week or two,
[01:32:21.640 --> 01:32:23.600]   and then you can give it to me,
[01:32:23.600 --> 01:32:24.800]   so that you have some experience with it.
[01:32:24.800 --> 01:32:27.600]   And I started, and I realized it's gonna wipe out everything.
[01:32:27.600 --> 01:32:30.040]   I'm gonna have to, and I said, no, no, no, no.
[01:32:30.040 --> 01:32:31.480]   I'm gonna play with it enough here.
[01:32:31.480 --> 01:32:32.360]   - Pretty fast.
[01:32:32.360 --> 01:32:33.200]   - Yeah, I don't--
[01:32:33.200 --> 01:32:34.680]   - You can do direct transfer now, it's pretty fast.
[01:32:34.680 --> 01:32:37.880]   - Oh, and I'm, yeah, by the way, oh, should mention that.
[01:32:37.880 --> 01:32:41.520]   For a long time, it was our recommendation,
[01:32:41.520 --> 01:32:43.480]   it was certainly my recommendation to connect the phone
[01:32:43.480 --> 01:32:45.840]   to the iTunes on the computer
[01:32:45.840 --> 01:32:48.480]   and back it up and restore it that way.
[01:32:48.480 --> 01:32:52.200]   They have worked every year on improving
[01:32:52.200 --> 01:32:54.080]   the iCloud backup and restore,
[01:32:54.080 --> 01:32:57.440]   and at this point, it is seamless, it's fast,
[01:32:57.440 --> 01:32:59.280]   it works very well.
[01:32:59.280 --> 01:33:02.120]   John Gruber said, better to do the slow one
[01:33:02.120 --> 01:33:04.360]   than the fast one, I don't know.
[01:33:04.840 --> 01:33:07.000]   It's not the slow one, so if you restore from iCloud,
[01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:08.160]   like coming down from the cloud,
[01:33:08.160 --> 01:33:09.800]   you won't get most of your passwords back.
[01:33:09.800 --> 01:33:12.160]   Most of them ain't passwords in one way than iCloud.
[01:33:12.160 --> 01:33:14.000]   But if you do the device to device one,
[01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:16.120]   and you can do it wireless, or you can plug in
[01:33:16.120 --> 01:33:18.240]   the camera adapter that gives you a lightning
[01:33:18.240 --> 01:33:20.440]   to lightning cable, basically, plug that in
[01:33:20.440 --> 01:33:22.280]   and do it hardwired, and then it's faster.
[01:33:22.280 --> 01:33:23.520]   But going device to device,
[01:33:23.520 --> 01:33:25.280]   you'll get all the passwords, all the tokens,
[01:33:25.280 --> 01:33:26.720]   everything as well.
[01:33:26.720 --> 01:33:29.560]   - So it's your recommendation to do the device to device?
[01:33:29.560 --> 01:33:31.840]   - Yeah, I mean, it's a little slower,
[01:33:31.840 --> 01:33:34.120]   I mean, so you can still do the encrypted iTunes backup
[01:33:34.120 --> 01:33:35.080]   if you're like desperate.
[01:33:35.080 --> 01:33:36.160]   I do that when I'm reviewing it,
[01:33:36.160 --> 01:33:37.960]   'cause I just, I need every second.
[01:33:37.960 --> 01:33:40.000]   But I've tried the wireless one several times,
[01:33:40.000 --> 01:33:41.680]   and now it works great.
[01:33:41.680 --> 01:33:43.040]   - Okay, yeah, I have to say.
[01:33:43.040 --> 01:33:45.000]   - I have to say, very, very impressed.
[01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:46.760]   I set up the iPad that way,
[01:33:46.760 --> 01:33:49.480]   and started to say, as I said,
[01:33:49.480 --> 01:33:52.760]   I started to set up the iPhone that way.
[01:33:52.760 --> 01:33:54.840]   But Lisa did it, she set up three phones,
[01:33:54.840 --> 01:33:57.160]   'cause we have a hand-me-down process.
[01:33:57.160 --> 01:33:59.200]   So her phone went to her son,
[01:33:59.200 --> 01:34:01.320]   her son's phone went to her ex,
[01:34:01.320 --> 01:34:03.480]   and so we set up three phones,
[01:34:03.480 --> 01:34:05.840]   and it was very nice, very seamless.
[01:34:05.840 --> 01:34:09.080]   Apple has really, every year, improved this process,
[01:34:09.080 --> 01:34:11.120]   and now it's pretty much painless.
[01:34:11.120 --> 01:34:12.920]   - It pops up, do you want to move your watchover,
[01:34:12.920 --> 01:34:13.920]   then the watch just reboots,
[01:34:13.920 --> 01:34:15.200]   and if the watch has moved over,
[01:34:15.200 --> 01:34:16.440]   and it has a little sticker up that says,
[01:34:16.440 --> 01:34:17.280]   do you want to move anything out?
[01:34:17.280 --> 01:34:18.120]   Yeah, it's really good.
[01:34:18.120 --> 01:34:19.040]   - So do device to device,
[01:34:19.040 --> 01:34:20.520]   'cause your cookies and everything get saved,
[01:34:20.520 --> 01:34:21.480]   so you don't have to,
[01:34:21.480 --> 01:34:24.000]   it's as if your phone moves over with you.
[01:34:24.000 --> 01:34:25.880]   - I think Andy is way softer than everybody else,
[01:34:25.880 --> 01:34:27.640]   because I keep hearing him like a second after,
[01:34:27.640 --> 01:34:29.720]   we start talking, but it's incredibly ducked.
[01:34:29.720 --> 01:34:33.080]   - Really, all right, I'm ducking myself
[01:34:33.080 --> 01:34:34.280]   because I don't want to interrupt people,
[01:34:34.280 --> 01:34:37.800]   sometimes they say something Andrew.
[01:34:37.800 --> 01:34:40.840]   - All I was going to say is to your comment earlier,
[01:34:40.840 --> 01:34:45.040]   it's such a joyous thing that Apple doesn't necessarily
[01:34:45.040 --> 01:34:46.280]   make the cheapest phones in the world,
[01:34:46.280 --> 01:34:49.320]   but you have phones that get passed on a second
[01:34:49.320 --> 01:34:51.880]   and a third time, 'cause they're still perfectly good,
[01:34:51.880 --> 01:34:52.880]   they're perfectly modern,
[01:34:52.880 --> 01:34:54.680]   and they run the latest operating system,
[01:34:54.680 --> 01:34:57.360]   and this is not something that many companies actually do.
[01:34:57.360 --> 01:34:58.360]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:35:00.240 --> 01:35:03.280]   - Will Shipley, very, very famous,
[01:35:03.280 --> 01:35:05.480]   created delicious library,
[01:35:05.480 --> 01:35:09.080]   changed the way Apple's software was developed
[01:35:09.080 --> 01:35:12.600]   for the Macintosh, has joined Apple.
[01:35:12.600 --> 01:35:14.480]   Kind of a shock.
[01:35:14.480 --> 01:35:17.840]   So he says, "I'd like to assure delicious library customers,
[01:35:17.840 --> 01:35:22.160]   I'll do my best to keep delicious library running,
[01:35:22.160 --> 01:35:23.680]   I can't add features anymore,
[01:35:23.680 --> 01:35:26.280]   but honestly, I haven't done that in a while anyway."
[01:35:26.280 --> 01:35:29.280]   But congratulations Will,
[01:35:29.280 --> 01:35:31.160]   he's a great developer,
[01:35:31.160 --> 01:35:33.200]   I expect we'll see some beautiful stuff
[01:35:33.200 --> 01:35:34.280]   coming out of Apple, thanks.
[01:35:34.280 --> 01:35:38.280]   - The next day is, he knows all the old school Apple
[01:35:38.280 --> 01:35:39.280]   executives.
[01:35:39.280 --> 01:35:44.280]   - Yeah, yeah, he's a long time third party developer,
[01:35:44.280 --> 01:35:47.560]   so he's joining Apple.
[01:35:47.560 --> 01:35:49.840]   I did have one problem with my Apple Watch,
[01:35:49.840 --> 01:35:52.920]   but it wasn't related to iOS 15,
[01:35:52.920 --> 01:35:54.360]   might've been related to watch OS,
[01:35:54.360 --> 01:35:57.320]   I hadn't updated the previous update,
[01:35:57.320 --> 01:35:59.560]   and I was, 'cause it was stuck.
[01:35:59.560 --> 01:36:01.760]   So I finally just reset my watch,
[01:36:01.760 --> 01:36:03.680]   which works pretty quickly,
[01:36:03.680 --> 01:36:05.160]   and got it up to watch OS 8.
[01:36:05.160 --> 01:36:06.160]   I don't know if that's,
[01:36:06.160 --> 01:36:08.840]   I've heard other people having a similar problem,
[01:36:08.840 --> 01:36:12.560]   so that was one little hitch in the upgrade.
[01:36:12.560 --> 01:36:13.920]   - There were also some people who were complaining
[01:36:13.920 --> 01:36:17.080]   about a jelly effect on the iPad Mini,
[01:36:17.080 --> 01:36:19.040]   which they could just see the refresh,
[01:36:19.040 --> 01:36:21.080]   and the reason for that is super simple,
[01:36:21.080 --> 01:36:23.440]   is that every LCD display refreshes
[01:36:23.440 --> 01:36:25.200]   from top to bottom basically,
[01:36:25.200 --> 01:36:26.840]   and if you turn it on an opposite direction
[01:36:26.840 --> 01:36:28.880]   on the iPad, you can turn it in any direction,
[01:36:28.880 --> 01:36:30.320]   and then scroll really slowly,
[01:36:30.320 --> 01:36:32.200]   if you're perpendicular to the refresh,
[01:36:32.200 --> 01:36:33.400]   you can sometimes see that,
[01:36:33.400 --> 01:36:35.880]   and this iPad Mini changed the direction of refresh
[01:36:35.880 --> 01:36:37.360]   from the previous iPad Mini,
[01:36:37.360 --> 01:36:39.280]   so I think people who moved from one to the other,
[01:36:39.280 --> 01:36:40.200]   weren't expecting it,
[01:36:40.200 --> 01:36:42.520]   and then once someone starts pointing it out,
[01:36:42.520 --> 01:36:44.360]   everybody notices it,
[01:36:44.360 --> 01:36:46.620]   but it's just how displays work.
[01:36:46.620 --> 01:36:49.320]   - Okay, good to know.
[01:36:49.320 --> 01:36:55.360]   Recent study on Apple's Apple Watch Series 6 Occimeter
[01:36:55.800 --> 01:36:57.520]   says it's good.
[01:36:57.520 --> 01:37:01.480]   In fact, this study from nature.com
[01:37:01.480 --> 01:37:04.280]   says that it's actually very useful in patients
[01:37:04.280 --> 01:37:05.640]   with lung disease,
[01:37:05.640 --> 01:37:09.840]   so of course, if you had lung disease,
[01:37:09.840 --> 01:37:12.560]   I probably would get a standalone pulse oximeter,
[01:37:12.560 --> 01:37:15.200]   but the Apple Watch,
[01:37:15.200 --> 01:37:18.120]   apparently we observed strong positive correlations
[01:37:18.120 --> 01:37:20.080]   between the Apple Watch device,
[01:37:20.080 --> 01:37:21.440]   and commercial oximeters
[01:37:21.440 --> 01:37:23.600]   when evaluating heart rate measurements,
[01:37:23.600 --> 01:37:25.480]   and oximetry measurements.
[01:37:25.480 --> 01:37:28.680]   I mean, very, there was no statistical difference
[01:37:28.680 --> 01:37:31.440]   in the evaluation of skin color, risk circumference,
[01:37:31.440 --> 01:37:32.640]   presence of wrist hair,
[01:37:32.640 --> 01:37:36.880]   and enamel nail for SPO2 and heart rate measurements.
[01:37:36.880 --> 01:37:40.560]   So the conclusion of this report is Apple Watch 6
[01:37:40.560 --> 01:37:43.160]   is a reliable way to obtain heart rate,
[01:37:43.160 --> 01:37:46.440]   and SPO2 in patients with lung diseases
[01:37:46.440 --> 01:37:48.360]   in a controlled environment.
[01:37:48.360 --> 01:37:50.360]   Wow, nice to go.
[01:37:50.360 --> 01:37:51.440]   - That could be very, very important,
[01:37:51.440 --> 01:37:53.360]   'cause it's sort of like when you get an alert
[01:37:53.360 --> 01:37:55.640]   that, hey, your heart is racing, and that's unusual,
[01:37:55.640 --> 01:37:57.440]   and you feel completely healthy.
[01:37:57.440 --> 01:37:58.800]   So many times,
[01:37:58.800 --> 01:38:01.720]   you hear about people who had a cold,
[01:38:01.720 --> 01:38:02.920]   and then they're dead three days later,
[01:38:02.920 --> 01:38:06.160]   'cause they did not know they had a serious respiratory illness,
[01:38:06.160 --> 01:38:09.960]   but if they started to get an alert to saying that,
[01:38:09.960 --> 01:38:11.440]   yeah, I know that right now you're just feeling
[01:38:11.440 --> 01:38:13.880]   rundown and feverish and coughing a lot,
[01:38:13.880 --> 01:38:16.920]   but your blood oxygen level has gone down to 92%
[01:38:16.920 --> 01:38:18.480]   when it's usually 98%,
[01:38:18.480 --> 01:38:20.600]   so perhaps now is a good time to call,
[01:38:20.600 --> 01:38:22.600]   make an appointment, have this checked out.
[01:38:23.440 --> 01:38:28.120]   - I don't, Apple, as you know, with iOS 15 did not ship out,
[01:38:28.120 --> 01:38:31.600]   it's a child pornography scanning feature,
[01:38:31.600 --> 01:38:34.320]   and I don't know if this has anything to do with it,
[01:38:34.320 --> 01:38:39.240]   but the EFF did fly a plane over Apple headquarters
[01:38:39.240 --> 01:38:40.400]   saying don't scan-- - You're donating
[01:38:40.400 --> 01:38:41.240]   money at work.
[01:38:41.240 --> 01:38:44.240]   - Don't scan branding. - I'm trying to get it
[01:38:44.240 --> 01:38:45.320]   on the view to complain about it,
[01:38:45.320 --> 01:38:47.320]   so like, I'm so confused, how will you?
[01:38:47.320 --> 01:38:49.240]   - Don't scan our phones,
[01:38:49.240 --> 01:38:52.680]   flew it over the Apple campus, even the old Apple campus,
[01:38:52.680 --> 01:38:56.520]   just to make sure everybody sees it, okay.
[01:38:56.520 --> 01:38:57.600]   - I just wonder if they planned it,
[01:38:57.600 --> 01:38:59.320]   I don't know whether they did that before,
[01:38:59.320 --> 01:39:01.520]   after Apple announced they were gonna delay it,
[01:39:01.520 --> 01:39:03.480]   but I just wonder if they planned it all,
[01:39:03.480 --> 01:39:05.320]   and they got it all working, and then Apple changed it,
[01:39:05.320 --> 01:39:06.560]   and they were like, well, let's do it anyway,
[01:39:06.560 --> 01:39:07.400]   well, it's interesting. - Yeah,
[01:39:07.400 --> 01:39:08.560]   I think it's exactly what happened,
[01:39:08.560 --> 01:39:10.480]   'cause in the article they said,
[01:39:10.480 --> 01:39:13.800]   well, this delay may be a diversionary tactic, so.
[01:39:13.800 --> 01:39:15.800]   (laughs)
[01:39:15.800 --> 01:39:18.520]   So, during the Apple event,
[01:39:19.520 --> 01:39:22.840]   which is silly, 'cause nobody's at Apple's headquarters
[01:39:22.840 --> 01:39:24.760]   for the event, but anyway,
[01:39:24.760 --> 01:39:30.280]   it went along with protests in front of Apple's store as well,
[01:39:30.280 --> 01:39:33.040]   but Apple had announced that they were gonna pause
[01:39:33.040 --> 01:39:34.640]   that before that.
[01:39:34.640 --> 01:39:36.600]   One password as a new feature, I love it,
[01:39:36.600 --> 01:39:39.880]   it's kind of like the Apple private email feature,
[01:39:39.880 --> 01:39:43.160]   it will randomly generate email addresses as you log in,
[01:39:43.160 --> 01:39:45.560]   so as all password managers do,
[01:39:45.560 --> 01:39:48.480]   they'll generate a random password,
[01:39:48.480 --> 01:39:51.440]   but now you can have a random email address,
[01:39:51.440 --> 01:39:53.760]   it works with Fast Mail,
[01:39:53.760 --> 01:39:56.560]   so that if you're a Fast Mail subscriber,
[01:39:56.560 --> 01:39:58.640]   you could just have a, you know,
[01:39:58.640 --> 01:40:01.640]   that's a, basically, it's not quite two factor,
[01:40:01.640 --> 01:40:04.240]   but it's definitely better than one factor.
[01:40:04.240 --> 01:40:06.480]   It's one and a half factors.
[01:40:06.480 --> 01:40:08.800]   - I think we're just seeing that, again,
[01:40:08.800 --> 01:40:10.480]   there's this, as Andy was talking about,
[01:40:10.480 --> 01:40:12.960]   there's this battle that's going on for privacy,
[01:40:12.960 --> 01:40:14.600]   where people have just gotten to the point
[01:40:14.600 --> 01:40:16.920]   where they're clear of what's happening,
[01:40:16.920 --> 01:40:20.000]   and that clarity is having them just basically be
[01:40:20.000 --> 01:40:21.360]   or obstinate about it.
[01:40:21.360 --> 01:40:22.880]   - Well, it's not just for privacy,
[01:40:22.880 --> 01:40:25.800]   it's also for security, because as you know,
[01:40:25.800 --> 01:40:28.080]   not only do you need a password, you need the email,
[01:40:28.080 --> 01:40:33.080]   so using a non-standard email is also even more secure.
[01:40:33.080 --> 01:40:37.200]   - Apple says, "We are not gonna allow Fortnite back
[01:40:37.200 --> 01:40:40.880]   "into the App Store until this court case is done
[01:40:40.880 --> 01:40:41.960]   "due to
[01:40:43.720 --> 01:40:47.560]   "epic duplicitous conduct."
[01:40:47.560 --> 01:40:48.440]   - Well, they found in court,
[01:40:48.440 --> 01:40:49.800]   - Galilex, mountain court basically.
[01:40:49.800 --> 01:40:51.320]   (laughing)
[01:40:51.320 --> 01:40:53.600]   - I mean, the bottom line is that Apple never has
[01:40:53.600 --> 01:40:55.520]   to let them back in, because they violated,
[01:40:55.520 --> 01:40:57.920]   the court has already-- - No, the court said so, yeah.
[01:40:57.920 --> 01:41:00.160]   - They violated the content, they violated their agreement,
[01:41:00.160 --> 01:41:01.160]   so once they violate the agreement,
[01:41:01.160 --> 01:41:03.280]   Apple could just say, "Well, we're never gonna do that."
[01:41:03.280 --> 01:41:05.640]   You know, so they're well within their rights at this point.
[01:41:05.640 --> 01:41:08.080]   - Yep, they have no legal obligation to do so.
[01:41:08.080 --> 01:41:10.360]   - And we'll forget what Fortnite was by the time it comes out.
[01:41:10.360 --> 01:41:12.200]   Like, it'll be like, you know, our kids will be like,
[01:41:12.200 --> 01:41:14.400]   playing some other games to the ball.
[01:41:14.400 --> 01:41:16.120]   - To solicitous.
[01:41:16.120 --> 01:41:17.720]   - They were duplicitous.
[01:41:17.720 --> 01:41:20.960]   - It sucks for people who really enjoyed Fortnite
[01:41:20.960 --> 01:41:22.440]   on the phone, and it's like,
[01:41:22.440 --> 01:41:24.400]   the judge and Apple even said that they could leave it
[01:41:24.400 --> 01:41:27.440]   on the phone and put all the money into where that S grow
[01:41:27.440 --> 01:41:28.880]   and then they would divide it at the end of the trial,
[01:41:28.880 --> 01:41:31.440]   and Fortnite said, "I don't understand their strategy."
[01:41:31.440 --> 01:41:32.880]   They were just like, "The dumbest way you could
[01:41:32.880 --> 01:41:35.360]   "litigate this case was a choice they made every time."
[01:41:35.360 --> 01:41:37.160]   And it affects people who did want to play
[01:41:37.160 --> 01:41:38.400]   on their iPhones, which is sad.
[01:41:38.400 --> 01:41:40.360]   - Well, where iPad, I mean, Fortnite on this mini
[01:41:40.360 --> 01:41:42.000]   would be actually pretty fun.
[01:41:42.000 --> 01:41:43.200]   - It's great. - Way to play.
[01:41:43.200 --> 01:41:44.320]   - It was, yeah.
[01:41:44.320 --> 01:41:46.720]   They were one of the first high frame rate implementations
[01:41:46.720 --> 01:41:47.560]   as well.
[01:41:47.560 --> 01:41:49.120]   Like they did so, they were like poster children
[01:41:49.120 --> 01:41:50.480]   for like, "How to make great games."
[01:41:50.480 --> 01:41:53.920]   Epic was on the stage so many times, and they just so dumb.
[01:41:53.920 --> 01:41:57.520]   - I know, like, that's the, and my upset with Epic
[01:41:57.520 --> 01:42:00.480]   happens to be that I love Unreal Engine, so.
[01:42:00.480 --> 01:42:01.320]   - Yeah.
[01:42:01.320 --> 01:42:03.720]   - So we, you know, we so, so they have such a great product,
[01:42:03.720 --> 01:42:06.920]   and they're doing so much great work as a company,
[01:42:06.920 --> 01:42:08.400]   you know, what they're buying, they're buying
[01:42:08.400 --> 01:42:10.280]   all the right apps, and they're making things free,
[01:42:10.280 --> 01:42:11.800]   and they're making it all great.
[01:42:11.800 --> 01:42:14.680]   And to me, what they, and my upset about this whole thing
[01:42:14.680 --> 01:42:17.680]   is mostly that it was just a completely unforced error.
[01:42:17.680 --> 01:42:19.720]   Like they just, you know, they've cost themselves
[01:42:19.720 --> 01:42:21.000]   whatever they thought they were gonna get,
[01:42:21.000 --> 01:42:23.000]   they've cost it way more than that.
[01:42:23.000 --> 01:42:24.480]   And they thought that they were gonna,
[01:42:24.480 --> 01:42:26.160]   I think that they had a bad case,
[01:42:26.160 --> 01:42:28.200]   they thought that they could get public opinion,
[01:42:28.200 --> 01:42:29.560]   and no one cared.
[01:42:29.560 --> 01:42:30.400]   (laughs)
[01:42:30.400 --> 01:42:31.400]   Oh, I'll just go play some other game.
[01:42:31.400 --> 01:42:33.480]   You know, and so, and so then they got into this,
[01:42:33.480 --> 01:42:35.160]   this back and forth, and they were, you know,
[01:42:35.160 --> 01:42:39.480]   to be on the Apple stage with Apple is worth billions.
[01:42:39.480 --> 01:42:42.440]   Like, you know, like it is worth, that's what they gave up.
[01:42:42.440 --> 01:42:44.480]   And, you know, and that's, you know,
[01:42:44.480 --> 01:42:46.520]   it's just an incredible, you know,
[01:42:46.520 --> 01:42:48.840]   it's just an incredible example of hubris.
[01:42:48.840 --> 01:42:51.160]   - So, they might say, Tim Sweeney might say,
[01:42:51.160 --> 01:42:53.880]   oh, you know, okay, fine, we lost sort of,
[01:42:53.880 --> 01:42:58.840]   but we did fight the fight, and Apple has started
[01:42:58.840 --> 01:43:00.160]   to back down a little bit.
[01:43:00.160 --> 01:43:02.520]   Apple has opened up the app store a little bit more,
[01:43:02.520 --> 01:43:04.440]   they've cut some of their fees.
[01:43:04.440 --> 01:43:07.880]   I mean, they could also declare a moral victory,
[01:43:07.880 --> 01:43:08.720]   if not a lead.
[01:43:08.720 --> 01:43:10.760]   - Sure, but he didn't, it was clear in the emails
[01:43:10.760 --> 01:43:12.960]   that he doesn't care about anybody else other than himself.
[01:43:12.960 --> 01:43:14.560]   Like, you know, like in the emails, they was like,
[01:43:14.560 --> 01:43:17.480]   if Apple, you know, if he could get what he wanted,
[01:43:17.480 --> 01:43:19.440]   he was gonna let everybody else burn.
[01:43:19.440 --> 01:43:20.560]   Like, he just wanted his deal.
[01:43:20.560 --> 01:43:23.160]   This is, there's no moral high ground here.
[01:43:23.160 --> 01:43:25.320]   It's just he just wanted a lower price, you know?
[01:43:25.320 --> 01:43:27.360]   And so, and so the thing is, is that that's,
[01:43:27.360 --> 01:43:29.280]   so whatever he thought he was going to win,
[01:43:29.280 --> 01:43:31.320]   he hasn't, by the time this gets through a court,
[01:43:31.320 --> 01:43:33.440]   Apple would have, will figure out, you know,
[01:43:33.440 --> 01:43:36.480]   six ways to Sunday to basically hollow out
[01:43:36.480 --> 01:43:37.840]   any agreement that's done.
[01:43:37.840 --> 01:43:39.760]   You know, so the thing, you know, they have plenty of time,
[01:43:39.760 --> 01:43:41.680]   you know, and so the thing is, is it's just,
[01:43:41.680 --> 01:43:44.480]   and what he gave up was this close relationship
[01:43:44.480 --> 01:43:47.440]   with this company that could help him over and over and over again.
[01:43:47.440 --> 01:43:49.040]   We can talk about the legal and the moral
[01:43:49.040 --> 01:43:49.880]   and all the other things.
[01:43:49.880 --> 01:43:51.520]   It was just a dumb thing to do, you know,
[01:43:51.520 --> 01:43:53.760]   like in, and it was, you know, from a business perspective,
[01:43:53.760 --> 01:43:55.760]   and you know, all people are people and they just,
[01:43:55.760 --> 01:43:58.880]   I've made plenty of mistakes as a CEO of companies,
[01:43:58.880 --> 01:44:01.400]   and I've done, I've had my fair share of stupid things.
[01:44:01.400 --> 01:44:03.640]   And so, it was just a stupid thing.
[01:44:03.640 --> 01:44:07.800]   - I've learned this from watching the fabulous HBO,
[01:44:07.800 --> 01:44:09.520]   or rather Showtime show,
[01:44:09.520 --> 01:44:12.760]   billions that you should not let emotion
[01:44:12.760 --> 01:44:15.160]   dictate your investment decisions.
[01:44:15.160 --> 01:44:17.000]   - I thought you were gonna say Silicon Valley.
[01:44:17.000 --> 01:44:19.840]   - And that too, but don't let emotion
[01:44:19.840 --> 01:44:22.160]   get into your business judgment.
[01:44:22.160 --> 01:44:23.080]   - Oh, he had a business model.
[01:44:23.080 --> 01:44:25.440]   I understand he has a business model he really wants to push for.
[01:44:25.440 --> 01:44:26.960]   - Well, he made a lot of money.
[01:44:26.960 --> 01:44:28.280]   - You know, but he has a business model.
[01:44:28.280 --> 01:44:29.360]   He wants to make a marketplace.
[01:44:29.360 --> 01:44:30.440]   He doesn't want to sell games.
[01:44:30.440 --> 01:44:31.280]   - Right.
[01:44:31.280 --> 01:44:32.120]   - He doesn't want to sell a platform.
[01:44:32.120 --> 01:44:32.960]   - Right.
[01:44:32.960 --> 01:44:33.800]   - He wants to sell a money.
[01:44:33.800 --> 01:44:35.400]   - Well, he's looking across the table as steam.
[01:44:35.400 --> 01:44:37.400]   - Well, he wants to be steam,
[01:44:37.400 --> 01:44:39.480]   and he wants to be steam on mobile.
[01:44:39.480 --> 01:44:42.680]   And I understand that that's a really good place to be.
[01:44:42.680 --> 01:44:46.360]   Steam is completely dominant in PC gaming.
[01:44:46.360 --> 01:44:48.520]   - It's just that I just think that the chances of him
[01:44:48.520 --> 01:44:50.920]   ever really getting the traction that he needs.
[01:44:50.920 --> 01:44:53.560]   You know, even if he wins all of these things,
[01:44:53.560 --> 01:44:55.640]   which the chances of him winning in the current
[01:44:55.640 --> 01:44:56.960]   court structure is pretty low.
[01:44:56.960 --> 01:44:58.360]   - I think he's, yeah.
[01:44:58.360 --> 01:44:59.200]   - I think he's lost.
[01:44:59.200 --> 01:45:01.640]   - You know, the chances of him winning are pretty low,
[01:45:01.640 --> 01:45:03.000]   and he'll keep on dragging it out.
[01:45:03.000 --> 01:45:04.560]   And by the time he gets to the other end,
[01:45:04.560 --> 01:45:06.560]   you know, Apple's going to make friends with other people
[01:45:06.560 --> 01:45:08.520]   or replace it all together themselves.
[01:45:08.520 --> 01:45:09.640]   They're going to, you know,
[01:45:09.640 --> 01:45:10.960]   and they're never going to give him.
[01:45:10.960 --> 01:45:14.240]   Like they'll, they will never give him the time of day,
[01:45:14.240 --> 01:45:15.640]   you know, forever.
[01:45:15.640 --> 01:45:16.720]   You know, and so the thing is,
[01:45:16.720 --> 01:45:19.840]   is that he's just, it's just a horrible uphill battle
[01:45:19.840 --> 01:45:21.080]   that he created for no reason.
[01:45:21.080 --> 01:45:22.560]   Like he had a great app.
[01:45:22.560 --> 01:45:24.120]   He has great technology.
[01:45:24.120 --> 01:45:26.560]   He has all the things, he has an incredible team.
[01:45:26.560 --> 01:45:28.520]   I have tons of friends that work at Epic.
[01:45:28.520 --> 01:45:30.880]   Like one of the best, the crap most crack teams
[01:45:30.880 --> 01:45:33.320]   when it comes to what they're doing.
[01:45:33.320 --> 01:45:35.640]   And so my upset with the whole thing is just that,
[01:45:35.640 --> 01:45:38.800]   wow, you had everything, everything going for you.
[01:45:38.800 --> 01:45:40.360]   And all you had to do was just,
[01:45:40.360 --> 01:45:42.000]   just keep making that work.
[01:45:42.000 --> 01:45:44.440]   And, and you see companies do this all the time.
[01:45:44.440 --> 01:45:46.200]   - Yeah, well, Steve Jobs did it.
[01:45:46.200 --> 01:45:47.200]   - Steve Jobs definitely did it.
[01:45:47.200 --> 01:45:48.040]   - He did it, it's a pleasure.
[01:45:48.040 --> 01:45:52.440]   - It's a scorcher against Adobe, against Google, you know.
[01:45:52.440 --> 01:45:53.280]   - Oh, and Avid did it.
[01:45:53.280 --> 01:45:54.880]   I mean, Avid declared they're going to drop
[01:45:54.880 --> 01:45:58.720]   the Mac platform and, oops, that was a bad move.
[01:45:58.720 --> 01:46:00.600]   - That was probably the most expensive press release
[01:46:00.600 --> 01:46:03.320]   ever released in the history of technology.
[01:46:03.320 --> 01:46:06.520]   - One thing that Apple definitely wins
[01:46:06.520 --> 01:46:09.360]   in the phone market is with updates,
[01:46:09.360 --> 01:46:12.120]   Google still struggles with getting Android phones,
[01:46:12.120 --> 01:46:15.640]   even half secure, adoption for iOS,
[01:46:15.640 --> 01:46:18.840]   15 is very good and works on all the phones
[01:46:18.840 --> 01:46:20.440]   all the way back to the iPhone 6s.
[01:46:20.440 --> 01:46:23.720]   But if you have an older phone, a 6 is 5s,
[01:46:23.720 --> 01:46:27.560]   or an iPad Air or Mini 2, 3, 6th generation iPod touch,
[01:46:27.560 --> 01:46:29.840]   you should get your updates.
[01:46:29.840 --> 01:46:33.440]   Apple's rolling out iOS 12.5, 0.5,
[01:46:33.440 --> 01:46:36.400]   those older devices that can't use iOS 15,
[01:46:36.400 --> 01:46:39.680]   and the update includes notable security fixes
[01:46:39.680 --> 01:46:41.280]   and improvements.
[01:46:41.280 --> 01:46:44.320]   So you might want to get that.
[01:46:44.320 --> 01:46:45.160]   It's good for Apple.
[01:46:45.160 --> 01:46:46.880]   I mean, they're keeping old stuff up to date,
[01:46:46.880 --> 01:46:49.280]   which I really respect.
[01:46:49.280 --> 01:46:51.040]   It's really good, very important.
[01:46:54.880 --> 01:46:58.080]   Tim Cook says employees who leak memos
[01:46:58.080 --> 01:47:02.080]   do not belong in Apple, according to a memo leaked.
[01:47:02.080 --> 01:47:03.240]   To Verde, the Verge.
[01:47:03.240 --> 01:47:07.480]   - You do not belong in Apple.
[01:47:07.480 --> 01:47:09.040]   - I'm getting it.
[01:47:09.040 --> 01:47:11.080]   - It's like when Mark Gurman leaked the memo
[01:47:11.080 --> 01:47:13.720]   about the people who got fired for leaking to Mark Gurman.
[01:47:13.720 --> 01:47:15.560]   The Verge is leaking a memo that Tim Cook did
[01:47:15.560 --> 01:47:17.560]   about the Verge, 'cause I forgot her name,
[01:47:17.560 --> 01:47:19.040]   but she was doing the play-by-play
[01:47:19.040 --> 01:47:20.560]   of the Apple meeting live on Twitter,
[01:47:20.560 --> 01:47:21.400]   and then she was like,
[01:47:21.400 --> 01:47:23.000]   "Oh, they're getting angry at me for a lot of tweeting.
[01:47:23.000 --> 01:47:26.720]   "Yeah, dear team, it was great to connect with you
[01:47:26.720 --> 01:47:28.920]   "at the Global Employees Meeting on Friday.
[01:47:28.920 --> 01:47:30.680]   "There was much to celebrate.
[01:47:30.680 --> 01:47:33.480]   "I'm writing today because I've heard from so many of you,
[01:47:33.480 --> 01:47:39.120]   "I've heard from so many of you who were incredibly frustrated
[01:47:39.120 --> 01:47:41.640]   "to see the contents of the meeting leaked to reporters.
[01:47:41.640 --> 01:47:42.960]   "This comes after a product launch,
[01:47:42.960 --> 01:47:45.040]   "in which most of the details of our announcement
[01:47:45.040 --> 01:47:46.880]   "were also leaked to the press.
[01:47:46.880 --> 01:47:49.240]   "I share your frustration."
[01:47:49.240 --> 01:47:50.760]   (laughing)
[01:47:50.760 --> 01:47:52.320]   We aren't doing everything in our power
[01:47:52.320 --> 01:47:54.360]   to identify those who leaked.
[01:47:54.360 --> 01:47:57.720]   - We're setting aside a special room in the gym
[01:47:57.720 --> 01:47:59.280]   so people can rent their clothes,
[01:47:59.280 --> 01:48:01.360]   rent their garments, and wail to God
[01:48:01.360 --> 01:48:02.360]   in the print privacy and security.
[01:48:02.360 --> 01:48:04.640]   - I'm shaving my head, I hope you will too.
[01:48:04.640 --> 01:48:07.840]   We know Leakers constitute a small number of people.
[01:48:07.840 --> 01:48:10.160]   We also know the people who leak confidential information
[01:48:10.160 --> 01:48:11.960]   do not belong here.
[01:48:11.960 --> 01:48:15.200]   As we look forward, I wanna thank you for all you've done,
[01:48:15.200 --> 01:48:16.480]   et cetera, et cetera.
[01:48:16.480 --> 01:48:18.960]   Yours truly, Tim.
[01:48:18.960 --> 01:48:20.720]   - This was kind of creepy, what with the timing,
[01:48:20.720 --> 01:48:25.000]   where all over the news was Apple employees
[01:48:25.000 --> 01:48:27.800]   are starting to complain that there is a code of silence
[01:48:27.800 --> 01:48:30.520]   that intimidates them against making complaints
[01:48:30.520 --> 01:48:32.000]   about workplace issues.
[01:48:32.000 --> 01:48:33.160]   And so here we go a week later,
[01:48:33.160 --> 01:48:34.840]   having an all staff saying,
[01:48:34.840 --> 01:48:37.600]   "Everybody who says anything about Apple
[01:48:37.600 --> 01:48:38.680]   "that gets to the outside,
[01:48:38.680 --> 01:48:40.200]   "we will be investigating you,
[01:48:40.200 --> 01:48:41.480]   "we will be punishing you,
[01:48:41.480 --> 01:48:43.360]   "and you do not belong here."
[01:48:43.360 --> 01:48:45.320]   - Well, I mean, the power to be your best.
[01:48:45.320 --> 01:48:48.400]   - Leaking is different than saying stuff in public.
[01:48:48.400 --> 01:48:51.040]   - No, not to Apple.
[01:48:51.040 --> 01:48:54.160]   - No, no, but you're making a station
[01:48:54.160 --> 01:48:56.520]   and leaking to a journalist and tweeting--
[01:48:56.520 --> 01:48:57.360]   - Or leaking.
[01:48:57.360 --> 01:48:59.720]   - And tweeting the all hands meeting.
[01:48:59.720 --> 01:49:01.720]   - No, but I'm saying leaking different things.
[01:49:01.720 --> 01:49:03.440]   - When you work at these companies,
[01:49:03.440 --> 01:49:06.120]   you do sign agreements to say you won't do that.
[01:49:06.120 --> 01:49:08.040]   And so you are breaking your agreement with the,
[01:49:08.040 --> 01:49:09.640]   I've signed lots of NDAs.
[01:49:09.640 --> 01:49:12.960]   So for lots and lots of different companies,
[01:49:12.960 --> 01:49:14.600]   and the joke is always,
[01:49:14.600 --> 01:49:16.600]   you can say whatever you want when you're last day.
[01:49:16.600 --> 01:49:21.600]   And so I think that they are breaking their agreement
[01:49:21.600 --> 01:49:23.960]   that they did sign with Apple.
[01:49:23.960 --> 01:49:26.280]   And so this is not a whistleblower.
[01:49:26.280 --> 01:49:28.600]   Whistleblower is going to the national board.
[01:49:28.600 --> 01:49:29.440]   - That's different.
[01:49:29.440 --> 01:49:32.280]   - So as a whistleblower, going to an external source,
[01:49:32.280 --> 01:49:34.720]   that is something that you have the right to do.
[01:49:34.720 --> 01:49:37.720]   To leak to the press is something that most companies
[01:49:37.720 --> 01:49:39.800]   would drum you out of the company if they can find you.
[01:49:39.800 --> 01:49:41.480]   I mean, that's leaking.
[01:49:41.480 --> 01:49:45.400]   - But keep in mind that this is the pretext upon which
[01:49:45.400 --> 01:49:47.120]   many companies, not just Apple,
[01:49:47.120 --> 01:49:48.440]   will say that, oh no, we took you,
[01:49:48.440 --> 01:49:51.000]   violated our NDA by telling people that
[01:49:51.000 --> 01:49:53.440]   some, but every Tuesday at 3 p.m.
[01:49:53.440 --> 01:49:55.760]   someone hits you in the face with a shaving cream pie
[01:49:55.760 --> 01:49:58.120]   and you said stop and they wouldn't stop.
[01:49:58.120 --> 01:50:00.640]   - It's the proper, but going to the national labor board
[01:50:00.640 --> 01:50:04.400]   is where you adjudicate that, not by leaking it.
[01:50:04.400 --> 01:50:06.520]   So the thing is, is that leaking leaking information.
[01:50:06.520 --> 01:50:08.000]   - Look, you can say whatever, you can,
[01:50:08.000 --> 01:50:10.600]   no, you're entitled to, if you're getting absolutely
[01:50:10.600 --> 01:50:12.480]   no resolution from the company on an issue
[01:50:12.480 --> 01:50:14.920]   that you think is abusive and you want to
[01:50:14.920 --> 01:50:17.120]   affect change within the company,
[01:50:17.120 --> 01:50:19.200]   you can't fault those people for saying the proper
[01:50:19.200 --> 01:50:21.840]   avenue for this is the national labor relations board
[01:50:21.840 --> 01:50:24.880]   when we realized that Apple doesn't really respond to
[01:50:24.880 --> 01:50:27.760]   a complaint with the national labor relations board,
[01:50:27.760 --> 01:50:30.120]   but oh my God, if you tweet out something about saying
[01:50:30.120 --> 01:50:32.760]   that Apple has been sitting on these four, zero days
[01:50:32.760 --> 01:50:34.600]   and they were supposed to credit me and they didn't,
[01:50:34.600 --> 01:50:36.560]   oh my God, once it's a PR problem,
[01:50:36.560 --> 01:50:39.320]   it really gets on Apple's radar and they get stuff done.
[01:50:39.320 --> 01:50:40.320]   - But it still, but it's still,
[01:50:40.320 --> 01:50:44.320]   - So I'm absolutely not 100% going to say that
[01:50:44.320 --> 01:50:48.400]   I believe that this is, I believe this was at best
[01:50:48.400 --> 01:50:51.600]   ill timed to when everyone, so many people inside Apple
[01:50:51.600 --> 01:50:53.560]   are thinking about this very issue,
[01:50:53.560 --> 01:50:55.840]   that there are issues that I really wish that Apple
[01:50:55.840 --> 01:50:58.480]   would address that Apple is refusing to address,
[01:50:58.480 --> 01:51:01.120]   but now I'm afraid to talk about it because they will say,
[01:51:01.120 --> 01:51:04.160]   well, your department is not authorized to know about,
[01:51:04.160 --> 01:51:07.400]   about how well, you've been harassed while you were
[01:51:07.400 --> 01:51:09.480]   developing something that other compartment
[01:51:09.480 --> 01:51:10.600]   was not supposed to know about.
[01:51:10.600 --> 01:51:13.120]   So therefore you're breaking your NDA
[01:51:13.120 --> 01:51:14.600]   with the department and you're fired.
[01:51:14.600 --> 01:51:18.560]   You can't, it was bad timing, bad visuals,
[01:51:18.560 --> 01:51:19.920]   or maybe just bad completely.
[01:51:19.920 --> 01:51:21.760]   I'm not going to equate that with,
[01:51:21.760 --> 01:51:23.440]   I'm not going to lump all these things together.
[01:51:23.440 --> 01:51:27.200]   I do think that once you're in that sort of situation,
[01:51:27.200 --> 01:51:28.960]   it would have been a great time for Apple to say,
[01:51:28.960 --> 01:51:30.840]   hey, we know that there have been all these issues
[01:51:30.840 --> 01:51:33.600]   about complaints inside of Apple,
[01:51:33.600 --> 01:51:35.920]   please realize that we are going to listen to these,
[01:51:35.920 --> 01:51:37.680]   we're going to look at our processes and procedures
[01:51:37.680 --> 01:51:39.480]   to see if there's things we're doing incorrectly.
[01:51:39.480 --> 01:51:42.240]   And of course, although we want things to be secret,
[01:51:42.240 --> 01:51:43.920]   we want you to be able to talk openly,
[01:51:43.920 --> 01:51:46.240]   at least inside Apple, about these issues.
[01:51:46.240 --> 01:51:47.560]   None of that was more like,
[01:51:47.560 --> 01:51:50.360]   remember, this is a company of secrets.
[01:51:50.360 --> 01:51:52.080]   We will find you, we will punish you.
[01:51:52.080 --> 01:51:54.240]   If you have anything to do with leaking secrets
[01:51:54.240 --> 01:51:55.880]   that we did not want to get out there.
[01:51:55.880 --> 01:51:56.880]   So that's a good point.
[01:51:56.880 --> 01:51:57.720]   - I think that's a good point.
[01:51:57.720 --> 01:51:59.600]   - Because the person who was tweeting the all hands meeting
[01:51:59.600 --> 01:52:02.200]   was tweeting specifically about labor issues.
[01:52:02.200 --> 01:52:03.880]   I mean, that was the purpose of that.
[01:52:03.880 --> 01:52:06.560]   - But I mean, see how Tim's response to the labor issues
[01:52:06.560 --> 01:52:11.200]   were, you know, were, and I, so I understand that wasn't,
[01:52:11.200 --> 01:52:13.240]   I'm sure that person did not consider themselves
[01:52:13.240 --> 01:52:16.400]   leaking proprietary product information.
[01:52:16.400 --> 01:52:19.240]   They were telling the world about a, a, a, a,
[01:52:19.240 --> 01:52:21.200]   employment issue at Apple.
[01:52:21.200 --> 01:52:22.660]   And I, and I think that is very different.
[01:52:22.660 --> 01:52:24.240]   I think you're right.
[01:52:24.240 --> 01:52:26.400]   - The, the issue though is that, is that you're,
[01:52:26.400 --> 01:52:28.040]   you're still breaking the rules.
[01:52:28.040 --> 01:52:28.880]   - Yeah.
[01:52:28.880 --> 01:52:30.320]   - So you're brave. - Well, you can get fired for it.
[01:52:30.320 --> 01:52:31.160]   - You can get fired for it.
[01:52:31.160 --> 01:52:32.000]   - You can get fired for it.
[01:52:32.000 --> 01:52:32.840]   - Nobody says you can't.
[01:52:32.840 --> 01:52:35.080]   - And it's just, it's just, you know, like we can talk about,
[01:52:35.080 --> 01:52:36.760]   you know, the morality of all the other things.
[01:52:36.760 --> 01:52:38.820]   - No, but I think Andy's point is, is well taken.
[01:52:38.820 --> 01:52:41.460]   - But this would have been an opportunity for Tim
[01:52:41.460 --> 01:52:44.960]   to make a distinction between the labor issues
[01:52:44.960 --> 01:52:46.860]   that they're having and product leaks.
[01:52:46.860 --> 01:52:48.780]   There's, that's two very different things.
[01:52:48.780 --> 01:52:50.220]   - The thing is is that the, the, the, the,
[01:52:50.220 --> 01:52:51.780]   all hands meetings, the reason the companies
[01:52:51.780 --> 01:52:53.500]   don't have all hands meetings is 'cause they're afraid
[01:52:53.500 --> 01:52:54.340]   people will leak things.
[01:52:54.340 --> 01:52:55.180]   - Right.
[01:52:55.180 --> 01:52:57.580]   - They're a pretty sacred place for a lot of these companies
[01:52:57.580 --> 01:53:01.060]   and leaking anything out of all hands meeting is,
[01:53:01.060 --> 01:53:03.700]   is really a violation of trust, you know?
[01:53:03.700 --> 01:53:04.900]   And the thing is, is the chances,
[01:53:04.900 --> 01:53:07.020]   it's one thing to talk about what you're upset about
[01:53:07.020 --> 01:53:10.700]   and everything else, you know, violating an all hands meeting
[01:53:10.700 --> 01:53:13.660]   is really a huge, because it means that the companies
[01:53:13.660 --> 01:53:14.460]   can't do it.
[01:53:14.460 --> 01:53:16.140]   They can't talk to all their employees.
[01:53:16.140 --> 01:53:17.940]   They can't have conversations.
[01:53:17.940 --> 01:53:20.660]   They can't be frank at all when they, when, when employees
[01:53:20.660 --> 01:53:24.100]   are, are handing out data from the all hands meeting.
[01:53:24.100 --> 01:53:26.220]   The reason that they exist is so that they can have
[01:53:26.220 --> 01:53:28.620]   communication and they're basically thwarting that.
[01:53:28.620 --> 01:53:31.420]   So, so the thing is, is that it's, you know, you know,
[01:53:31.420 --> 01:53:35.580]   I just think that it's, it's a pretty, pretty big slap
[01:53:35.580 --> 01:53:38.020]   in the face to, to, to take something out of an all hands
[01:53:38.020 --> 01:53:39.380]   meeting and put it, make it public.
[01:53:39.380 --> 01:53:42.100]   And so, so, you know, they can do whatever they want to do,
[01:53:42.100 --> 01:53:43.420]   but I think that they're gonna, you know,
[01:53:43.420 --> 01:53:45.500]   Apple will figure out who it is and they won't be there
[01:53:45.500 --> 01:53:46.340]   anymore.
[01:53:46.340 --> 01:53:47.740]   And if you, if you have all these complaints and you think
[01:53:47.740 --> 01:53:48.860]   that it's okay to do an all hands meeting,
[01:53:48.860 --> 01:53:50.780]   you probably don't believe in, belong in a corporate
[01:53:50.780 --> 01:53:53.220]   environment, you belong somewhere else in a smaller company
[01:53:53.220 --> 01:53:55.380]   that doesn't have all hands meetings, you know?
[01:53:55.380 --> 01:53:58.340]   And, and, and that's what you're going to find if you do it.
[01:53:58.340 --> 01:54:04.260]   - Let's see, we should real quickly, before we take our
[01:54:04.260 --> 01:54:08.700]   final break, run through a few of the rumors that are
[01:54:08.700 --> 01:54:10.100]   floating about.
[01:54:10.100 --> 01:54:14.620]   This is the last, oh yeah, go ahead.
[01:54:14.620 --> 01:54:16.620]   - I was gonna say there was a big update to iWork today,
[01:54:16.620 --> 01:54:17.620]   which was pretty phenomenal.
[01:54:17.620 --> 01:54:18.460]   - Oh, okay.
[01:54:18.460 --> 01:54:19.780]   I didn't even know about that.
[01:54:19.780 --> 01:54:20.620]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:54:20.620 --> 01:54:22.020]   - Yeah, so keynote has gotten live streaming.
[01:54:22.020 --> 01:54:24.660]   So you can live, there's a live video object now that you
[01:54:24.660 --> 01:54:27.180]   can put in any keynote presentation and you can treat it
[01:54:27.180 --> 01:54:28.180]   like any live object.
[01:54:28.180 --> 01:54:30.460]   So it can be just like a regular sized object on the,
[01:54:30.460 --> 01:54:33.220]   on the slide, it can be the full slide and then you can
[01:54:33.220 --> 01:54:34.900]   stream to that as you're presenting.
[01:54:34.900 --> 01:54:37.060]   So you're, it's, it's almost like, you know, like in the
[01:54:37.060 --> 01:54:39.260]   video game YouTube, where you have the person in the corner
[01:54:39.260 --> 01:54:42.300]   talking to you while the, while the game or whatever is
[01:54:42.300 --> 01:54:45.940]   playing, or they just take over the slide or, or, or, you
[01:54:45.940 --> 01:54:48.140]   know, anything you want to do with it, you can add effects,
[01:54:48.140 --> 01:54:49.180]   all those things.
[01:54:49.180 --> 01:54:51.980]   There's also co-presenter modes, cause they, a lot of people
[01:54:51.980 --> 01:54:54.220]   call these the COVID releases because a lot of feature
[01:54:54.220 --> 01:54:57.020]   sets have been determined by our last two years, but when
[01:54:57.020 --> 01:54:59.540]   they can now have multiple presenters so that you don't
[01:54:59.540 --> 01:55:01.900]   have to keep hearing, oh, go, like next slide, please.
[01:55:01.900 --> 01:55:03.500]   Oh, too far, go back, please.
[01:55:03.500 --> 01:55:06.300]   You can just hand over control of the keynote.
[01:55:06.300 --> 01:55:09.660]   There's pivot tables in numbers, which I know for a lot of
[01:55:09.660 --> 01:55:14.100]   spreadsheet nerds has been way too, way too late in coming.
[01:55:14.100 --> 01:55:15.100]   Yeah.
[01:55:15.100 --> 01:55:17.180]   And one of my favorites, it turns out that I didn't
[01:55:17.180 --> 01:55:20.300]   realize this, but pages on the iPhone is their most popular
[01:55:20.300 --> 01:55:21.300]   app.
[01:55:21.300 --> 01:55:22.780]   iPhone is the most popular place for iWork and
[01:55:22.780 --> 01:55:25.220]   paid iPhone is the most popular app.
[01:55:25.220 --> 01:55:27.940]   And now there's a button, like basically reader mode, so
[01:55:27.940 --> 01:55:29.540]   that when you get a pages document, you don't have to
[01:55:29.540 --> 01:55:32.420]   zoom in and out just to read what's formatted for a normal
[01:55:32.420 --> 01:55:35.460]   sized document, you just hit reader mode, doesn't change any
[01:55:35.460 --> 01:55:37.100]   of the formatting at all, but it gives it to you the way
[01:55:37.100 --> 01:55:40.660]   Safari reader mode does in much bigger, clearer, vertically
[01:55:40.660 --> 01:55:42.940]   stacked layouts, and then you can just go through and read
[01:55:42.940 --> 01:55:44.420]   the document and check it.
[01:55:44.420 --> 01:55:46.780]   So there's just a bunch of really good quality of life
[01:55:46.780 --> 01:55:47.460]   improvements.
[01:55:47.460 --> 01:55:49.580]   I love it that they're keeping this up today, because it's
[01:55:49.580 --> 01:55:52.620]   can't be a big money maker for them, they give it away.
[01:55:52.620 --> 01:55:52.940]   And so--
[01:55:52.940 --> 01:55:54.980]   11 updates in three years, I think they should.
[01:55:54.980 --> 01:55:55.980]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:55:55.980 --> 01:55:59.380]   These updates are for all versions of iWork.
[01:55:59.380 --> 01:56:03.860]   So if you use iWork on Mac, iPhone, or iPad, you're going
[01:56:03.860 --> 01:56:04.740]   to want to update it.
[01:56:04.740 --> 01:56:05.700]   There's the reader mode.
[01:56:05.700 --> 01:56:09.180]   Yeah, that was my pick for the week.
[01:56:09.180 --> 01:56:10.900]   Oh, sorry.
[01:56:10.900 --> 01:56:13.020]   So anyway, so the--
[01:56:13.020 --> 01:56:14.180]   You can save it.
[01:56:14.180 --> 01:56:16.220]   You can save more if you want later.
[01:56:16.220 --> 01:56:16.660]   OK.
[01:56:16.660 --> 01:56:18.420]   I'll just say, I'll just refer back to the section.
[01:56:18.420 --> 01:56:22.300]   We were talking about it, but the keynote updates are
[01:56:22.300 --> 01:56:22.900]   pretty interesting.
[01:56:22.900 --> 01:56:27.180]   The live video inputs the ability to--
[01:56:27.180 --> 01:56:29.700]   So give me an example of how you use a live video
[01:56:29.700 --> 01:56:30.700]   and put it in a correct situation.
[01:56:30.700 --> 01:56:30.900]   I don't know.
[01:56:30.900 --> 01:56:32.260]   It just got released.
[01:56:32.260 --> 01:56:33.900]   You know what it is.
[01:56:33.900 --> 01:56:36.460]   I was going to-- Alex Goner tweeted it out earlier.
[01:56:36.460 --> 01:56:37.060]   He's a friend of mine.
[01:56:37.060 --> 01:56:38.180]   And he tweeted it out.
[01:56:38.180 --> 01:56:40.860]   And so I was like, I'm excited.
[01:56:40.860 --> 01:56:45.140]   I'm just going to talk about it, because I still think that
[01:56:45.140 --> 01:56:48.460]   keynote is probably one of the most important communication
[01:56:48.460 --> 01:56:49.420]   tools ever made.
[01:56:49.420 --> 01:56:52.700]   It is so effective at putting things together.
[01:56:52.700 --> 01:56:56.820]   Well, but it is so effective at building
[01:56:56.820 --> 01:56:57.860]   illustrating ideas.
[01:56:57.860 --> 01:57:00.740]   And it's so much more fluid than the other solutions, which I
[01:57:00.740 --> 01:57:02.540]   have to use all the time.
[01:57:02.540 --> 01:57:04.540]   So I have to use all of them all the time.
[01:57:04.540 --> 01:57:08.060]   And so it's not like there's three versions.
[01:57:08.060 --> 01:57:10.420]   There's PowerPoint and slides and keynote.
[01:57:10.420 --> 01:57:11.500]   There's PowerPoint and slides.
[01:57:11.500 --> 01:57:12.940]   And they're kind of close to each other.
[01:57:12.940 --> 01:57:14.700]   And then there's keynote, which is in an entirely different
[01:57:14.700 --> 01:57:15.940]   world.
[01:57:15.940 --> 01:57:18.860]   And so the thing is is that it is--
[01:57:18.860 --> 01:57:21.820]   and so keynote now has-- what it says here is that it's
[01:57:21.820 --> 01:57:24.060]   going to-- and we'll talk about it probably in the future.
[01:57:24.060 --> 01:57:25.900]   But you can actually put live video
[01:57:25.900 --> 01:57:27.420]   into your presentation.
[01:57:27.420 --> 01:57:30.980]   And you have some new charts and so and so forth for numbers
[01:57:30.980 --> 01:57:31.260]   as well.
[01:57:31.260 --> 01:57:34.140]   But the live video and the ability for multiple people to run--
[01:57:34.140 --> 01:57:36.500]   for people like me, multiple people
[01:57:36.500 --> 01:57:41.500]   being able to run their one presentation from anywhere
[01:57:41.500 --> 01:57:43.260]   in the world is a big deal.
[01:57:43.260 --> 01:57:46.100]   Because we're doing all these presentations for people
[01:57:46.100 --> 01:57:49.500]   where you have people in all kinds of different remote areas
[01:57:49.500 --> 01:57:50.740]   and how do you get them all in.
[01:57:50.740 --> 01:57:53.940]   For the live video, I think that what you can do there--
[01:57:53.940 --> 01:57:58.260]   the way I read it-- is that you can have a web video or my black
[01:57:58.260 --> 01:58:01.100]   magic 6K or whatever feeding in the keynote.
[01:58:01.100 --> 01:58:04.820]   And if I'm screen scraping it and pushing it into Zoom
[01:58:04.820 --> 01:58:07.780]   or whatever, I can have that picture and picture experience
[01:58:07.780 --> 01:58:10.620]   that I might want with what I'm doing.
[01:58:10.620 --> 01:58:14.060]   So it's some pretty cool tools that are built in.
[01:58:14.060 --> 01:58:17.060]   And the page is stuff that the new reader looks amazing
[01:58:17.060 --> 01:58:19.860]   to be able to just take a page is formatted and pull it
[01:58:19.860 --> 01:58:21.420]   into something that's easy to read on an iPhone.
[01:58:21.420 --> 01:58:23.700]   It's one of the reasons I don't sometimes
[01:58:23.700 --> 01:58:25.420]   build things in pages because I know people are going to read it
[01:58:25.420 --> 01:58:26.740]   in an iPhone.
[01:58:26.740 --> 01:58:28.540]   So being able to publish that out and be
[01:58:28.540 --> 01:58:30.300]   able to turn it into something that you can look at
[01:58:30.300 --> 01:58:30.900]   is pretty good.
[01:58:30.900 --> 01:58:35.260]   Because again, pages give you-- if I don't do something in keynote,
[01:58:35.260 --> 01:58:38.060]   I build it in pages because it gives me
[01:58:38.060 --> 01:58:39.380]   a competitive advantage.
[01:58:39.380 --> 01:58:41.220]   We can talk about whether people have access
[01:58:41.220 --> 01:58:42.380]   or whatever they want to do.
[01:58:42.380 --> 01:58:46.140]   But usually, when I'm doing a presentation or a pitch,
[01:58:46.140 --> 01:58:48.340]   I just want all the competitive advantages I can have.
[01:58:48.340 --> 01:58:50.220]   And one of them is that pages just
[01:58:50.220 --> 01:58:52.020]   looks a lot better than Word.
[01:58:52.020 --> 01:58:55.380]   And so if I want to put text in it the way it
[01:58:55.380 --> 01:58:58.100]   turns, the way it anti-aliases, the way it builds pictures,
[01:58:58.100 --> 01:59:00.300]   the way it lays out, it just looks a lot nicer.
[01:59:00.300 --> 01:59:01.580]   The templates are a lot better.
[01:59:01.580 --> 01:59:05.060]   And so it's just getting-- so it's a lot better platform.
[01:59:05.060 --> 01:59:06.940]   People are going to talk about what they like to use
[01:59:06.940 --> 01:59:07.740]   and don't like to use.
[01:59:07.740 --> 01:59:10.300]   But your stuff looks better in both of those things.
[01:59:10.300 --> 01:59:12.860]   And that means that you oftentimes
[01:59:12.860 --> 01:59:15.340]   can separate yourself from other competitors
[01:59:15.340 --> 01:59:17.380]   when you're presenting something.
[01:59:17.380 --> 01:59:19.620]   And so it's a really powerful update.
[01:59:19.620 --> 01:59:20.460]   I was a little disappointed.
[01:59:20.460 --> 01:59:23.580]   We didn't see any support for 3D objects.
[01:59:23.580 --> 01:59:24.660]   That's what I was hoping.
[01:59:24.660 --> 01:59:25.980]   I've always waited for updates going.
[01:59:25.980 --> 01:59:27.220]   I think I put 3D objects in.
[01:59:27.220 --> 01:59:28.140]   We didn't see that.
[01:59:28.140 --> 01:59:30.580]   But the other stuff looks pretty and powerful.
[01:59:30.580 --> 01:59:32.420]   There's my pick.
[01:59:32.420 --> 01:59:32.740]   Good.
[01:59:32.740 --> 01:59:33.820]   You just did it early.
[01:59:33.820 --> 01:59:34.620]   That's all.
[01:59:34.620 --> 01:59:35.620]   That's fine.
[01:59:35.620 --> 01:59:37.820]   No, it's a big story.
[01:59:37.820 --> 01:59:39.900]   I know I don't use I work.
[01:59:39.900 --> 01:59:43.260]   And every time I see stuff like this, I really should use I work.
[01:59:43.260 --> 01:59:44.300]   It's so much.
[01:59:44.300 --> 01:59:45.980]   There's things about it that if you
[01:59:45.980 --> 01:59:47.940]   want to collaborate with other people, it's not a great--
[01:59:47.940 --> 01:59:49.180]   I mean, this collaboration of being
[01:59:49.180 --> 01:59:50.900]   what do the presentation is great.
[01:59:50.900 --> 01:59:52.500]   The collaboration tools and I work,
[01:59:52.500 --> 01:59:54.020]   I don't think are that great.
[01:59:54.020 --> 01:59:55.540]   If I'm going to collaborate with someone
[01:59:55.540 --> 01:59:57.020]   and we're all going to look at a spreadsheet,
[01:59:57.020 --> 01:59:59.100]   we're going to do it in sheets.
[01:59:59.100 --> 02:00:00.380]   That's the reality.
[02:00:00.380 --> 02:00:01.940]   Well, I think that that's part of the problem
[02:00:01.940 --> 02:00:05.580]   is that if you're a spreadsheet wonk, you want Excel.
[02:00:05.580 --> 02:00:06.140]   Period.
[02:00:06.140 --> 02:00:07.140]   OK.
[02:00:07.140 --> 02:00:09.900]   But what kind of spreadsheet wonk?
[02:00:09.900 --> 02:00:12.500]   So the thing is, if you're doing heavy spreadsheets,
[02:00:12.500 --> 02:00:16.300]   you're absolutely right that Excel excels.
[02:00:16.300 --> 02:00:21.140]   When you're doing really complex multi-sheet and heavy data,
[02:00:21.140 --> 02:00:24.620]   when it comes to doing calculations for your budget,
[02:00:24.620 --> 02:00:27.780]   proposals, layouts, a lot of the organizational stuff
[02:00:27.780 --> 02:00:30.700]   that we do, numbers is so much easier to build.
[02:00:30.700 --> 02:00:32.780]   It's so much faster to use numbers
[02:00:32.780 --> 02:00:34.020]   to do most of those other things.
[02:00:34.020 --> 02:00:35.260]   All my bids that I do are all--
[02:00:35.260 --> 02:00:36.300]   It's prettier.
[02:00:36.300 --> 02:00:36.900]   It's prettier.
[02:00:36.900 --> 02:00:37.900]   No, it's not just prettier.
[02:00:37.900 --> 02:00:39.060]   It's faster.
[02:00:39.060 --> 02:00:42.140]   It's way faster and way more seamless for me
[02:00:42.140 --> 02:00:43.340]   to build what I build.
[02:00:43.340 --> 02:00:44.940]   And I have a thing about white space.
[02:00:44.940 --> 02:00:48.700]   And so I hate the idea that I have to look at cells
[02:00:48.700 --> 02:00:49.500]   all the way across.
[02:00:49.500 --> 02:00:51.620]   With numbers, I build my own little tables.
[02:00:51.620 --> 02:00:52.740]   I put them where I want.
[02:00:52.740 --> 02:00:55.260]   This table has a different font size than these ones.
[02:00:55.260 --> 02:00:56.100]   That's what I mean by it.
[02:00:56.100 --> 02:00:57.180]   It's prettier, Alex.
[02:00:57.180 --> 02:00:58.020]   Well, I know.
[02:00:58.020 --> 02:00:59.740]   But OK, yeah.
[02:00:59.740 --> 02:01:04.620]   But when I win a lot of bids--
[02:01:04.620 --> 02:01:05.140]   Yeah.
[02:01:05.140 --> 02:01:06.500]   No, it's definitely prettier.
[02:01:06.500 --> 02:01:07.580]   When we say prettier--
[02:01:07.580 --> 02:01:09.820]   It depends what you use a spreadsheet for.
[02:01:09.820 --> 02:01:10.220]   I mean--
[02:01:10.220 --> 02:01:10.740]   Exactly.
[02:01:10.740 --> 02:01:11.500]   But but a lot of times--
[02:01:11.500 --> 02:01:12.100]   But a lot of times--
[02:01:12.100 --> 02:01:13.700]   --for finances.
[02:01:13.700 --> 02:01:14.220]   Sure.
[02:01:14.220 --> 02:01:14.740]   --with a six cell.
[02:01:14.740 --> 02:01:15.420]   She doesn't want--
[02:01:15.420 --> 02:01:16.420]   Sure, and that's fine.
[02:01:16.420 --> 02:01:19.060]   She doesn't want white space.
[02:01:19.060 --> 02:01:21.860]   And similarly, I think there are better ways
[02:01:21.860 --> 02:01:24.740]   if you're a writer than pages to write.
[02:01:24.740 --> 02:01:25.900]   I know you don't write in pages.
[02:01:25.900 --> 02:01:26.860]   Nobody writes in pages.
[02:01:26.860 --> 02:01:28.500]   It's a presentation tool.
[02:01:28.500 --> 02:01:29.340]   I write in notes.
[02:01:29.340 --> 02:01:30.980]   But I mean, I think we'd all agree.
[02:01:30.980 --> 02:01:32.420]   keynote is better than PowerPoint.
[02:01:32.420 --> 02:01:34.820]   There's just not even a close--
[02:01:34.820 --> 02:01:35.740]   It's more alien.
[02:01:35.740 --> 02:01:38.220]   --until all the battleship features.
[02:01:38.220 --> 02:01:40.860]   Up until recently, keynote was used for everybody's
[02:01:40.860 --> 02:01:42.420]   presentations, whether they knew it or not.
[02:01:42.420 --> 02:01:44.820]   And then that got out.
[02:01:44.820 --> 02:01:46.620]   So we then had to start doing it.
[02:01:46.620 --> 02:01:47.740]   I'm sick of PowerPoint.
[02:01:47.740 --> 02:01:50.220]   The look of PowerPoint has just got awful.
[02:01:50.220 --> 02:01:52.260]   So I guess I should look at it some more.
[02:01:52.260 --> 02:01:54.620]   I just-- I feel like if I want to write,
[02:01:54.620 --> 02:01:56.100]   I'm not going to use pages.
[02:01:56.100 --> 02:01:58.260]   If I want to crunch numbers, I'm not
[02:01:58.260 --> 02:01:59.900]   going to use numbers.
[02:01:59.900 --> 02:02:01.340]   I don't write in Word either.
[02:02:01.340 --> 02:02:01.820]   So it's--
[02:02:01.820 --> 02:02:02.620]   You know, I just don't want to--
[02:02:02.620 --> 02:02:04.180]   No, I wouldn't want to write Word either.
[02:02:04.180 --> 02:02:04.860]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:02:04.860 --> 02:02:06.100]   It's like to be raw.
[02:02:06.100 --> 02:02:07.620]   Yeah, I don't use Microsoft Office either,
[02:02:07.620 --> 02:02:08.860]   to be fair, except for Excel.
[02:02:08.860 --> 02:02:11.740]   I just want plain text.
[02:02:11.740 --> 02:02:14.580]   Rumors, get it quickly to the rumors.
[02:02:14.580 --> 02:02:16.660]   We are at the end of September.
[02:02:16.660 --> 02:02:21.620]   So next Tuesday is October 4th.
[02:02:21.620 --> 02:02:23.860]   Will there be an event then?
[02:02:23.860 --> 02:02:25.380]   Yeah, you're in October 5th, they should say.
[02:02:25.380 --> 02:02:26.740]   Yeah, you're in A. What do you think?
[02:02:26.740 --> 02:02:27.300]   I guess not.
[02:02:27.300 --> 02:02:29.500]   We've received an invite by now, right?
[02:02:29.500 --> 02:02:30.180]   Yeah.
[02:02:30.180 --> 02:02:33.660]   October 12th, second Tuesday.
[02:02:33.660 --> 02:02:35.980]   There's only four Tuesdays in October.
[02:02:35.980 --> 02:02:37.700]   5th, 12th, 19th, and 26th.
[02:02:37.700 --> 02:02:39.140]   It had October 31st.
[02:02:39.140 --> 02:02:41.300]   And last year, they used November for the Mac.
[02:02:41.300 --> 02:02:42.140]   So we have--
[02:02:42.140 --> 02:02:42.540]   Maybe it's November.
[02:02:42.540 --> 02:02:43.620]   --a range of weeks to pick from.
[02:02:43.620 --> 02:02:45.260]   Yeah, maybe it's November, you think?
[02:02:45.260 --> 02:02:45.820]   Yeah.
[02:02:45.820 --> 02:02:49.180]   Are they going to do-- they're not going to do three events
[02:02:49.180 --> 02:02:50.780]   this fall then, you think?
[02:02:50.780 --> 02:02:54.780]   Andy and I were together on October 30th or 31st in New York.
[02:02:54.780 --> 02:02:56.580]   And people were dressing for Halloween already.
[02:02:56.580 --> 02:02:58.540]   It was the weirdest Apple event by the night ever night.
[02:02:58.540 --> 02:03:00.300]   I feel like that's a little late for a product
[02:03:00.300 --> 02:03:04.220]   that you want to have in the store for the holidays.
[02:03:04.220 --> 02:03:07.060]   The other complication is that the best rumor right now
[02:03:07.060 --> 02:03:09.100]   is that Google is going to be having a hardware event
[02:03:09.100 --> 02:03:10.260]   on October 19th.
[02:03:10.260 --> 02:03:10.740]   Right.
[02:03:10.740 --> 02:03:12.580]   So that would ace them out of one Tuesday.
[02:03:12.580 --> 02:03:14.580]   If that is truly a date--
[02:03:14.580 --> 02:03:15.100]   I'm thinking--
[02:03:15.100 --> 02:03:16.460]   --if it knows the date and if they're care.
[02:03:16.460 --> 02:03:20.660]   I'm thinking not-- it's obviously not next Tuesday.
[02:03:20.660 --> 02:03:22.380]   So I'm thinking--
[02:03:22.380 --> 02:03:25.820]   I think we're thinking of the 12th here.
[02:03:25.820 --> 02:03:26.180]   Anyway.
[02:03:26.180 --> 02:03:27.140]   Or November.
[02:03:27.140 --> 02:03:29.740]   Or November, which is too late.
[02:03:29.740 --> 02:03:30.740]   But I guess they could do that.
[02:03:30.740 --> 02:03:32.460]   But these aren't the school computers.
[02:03:32.460 --> 02:03:34.220]   These are the computers that pros have been waiting on these.
[02:03:34.220 --> 02:03:35.500]   So what are we going to see?
[02:03:35.500 --> 02:03:38.500]   The 16-inch MacBook Pro with the M1X?
[02:03:38.500 --> 02:03:39.460]   14 and 16, yeah.
[02:03:39.460 --> 02:03:42.420]   14 and 16.
[02:03:42.420 --> 02:03:46.900]   Guo Ming Chi, as you say, has disappointed me
[02:03:46.900 --> 02:03:51.900]   because he says the new MacBook Air won't be till next year.
[02:03:51.900 --> 02:03:53.020]   It was always next year.
[02:03:53.020 --> 02:03:54.820]   I think the difference is they were previously
[02:03:54.820 --> 02:03:56.100]   saying first quarter next year.
[02:03:56.100 --> 02:03:57.620]   Now they're saying second quarter next year.
[02:03:57.620 --> 02:03:58.620]   He's saying Q3.
[02:03:58.620 --> 02:03:59.700]   Next year is what's going to--
[02:03:59.700 --> 02:04:02.700]   No, but maybe he's Apple's Q3, which would be--
[02:04:02.700 --> 02:04:04.020]   Yeah, Apple's Q3 is--
[02:04:04.020 --> 02:04:05.300]   --RQ2.
[02:04:05.300 --> 02:04:06.460]   The June-ish.
[02:04:06.460 --> 02:04:06.980]   OK.
[02:04:06.980 --> 02:04:08.700]   So summer next-- next summer.
[02:04:08.700 --> 02:04:09.700]   That's not so bad.
[02:04:09.700 --> 02:04:10.140]   It will be June, yeah.
[02:04:10.140 --> 02:04:11.380]   That's not so bad.
[02:04:11.380 --> 02:04:14.860]   And then this is an interesting story.
[02:04:14.860 --> 02:04:19.740]   Apple AR headset rumored $2,000 plus price tag
[02:04:19.740 --> 02:04:25.260]   entering mass production Q2 2022.
[02:04:25.260 --> 02:04:27.340]   This is from the Taiwanese version of Digitimes.
[02:04:27.340 --> 02:04:28.780]   I think he's inflating the two.
[02:04:28.780 --> 02:04:30.300]   OK.
[02:04:30.300 --> 02:04:31.260]   OK.
[02:04:31.260 --> 02:04:32.980]   So what do you think?
[02:04:32.980 --> 02:04:35.740]   The only rumor mill I care about is Rene rumor mill
[02:04:35.740 --> 02:04:37.020]   Mitchi, Richie.
[02:04:37.020 --> 02:04:39.140]   No, I think that we'll see the VR headset sooner.
[02:04:39.140 --> 02:04:40.820]   That's like an Apple TV style product.
[02:04:40.820 --> 02:04:43.140]   It's like they figured out a way to make an Apple TV
[02:04:43.140 --> 02:04:45.620]   a personal product, again, not a family product.
[02:04:45.620 --> 02:04:47.060]   And they control everything about it.
[02:04:47.060 --> 02:04:48.900]   They don't have to worry about big TVs and stuff.
[02:04:48.900 --> 02:04:51.900]   And they can deliver fitness plus video games.
[02:04:51.900 --> 02:04:53.300]   So you think that's what it'll be--
[02:04:53.300 --> 02:04:56.100]   --is an Apple TV for your head?
[02:04:56.100 --> 02:04:56.580]   Yes.
[02:04:56.580 --> 02:04:58.420]   Yeah, I think it's going to come right out of that same project.
[02:04:58.420 --> 02:05:00.220]   The same way the glasses would come out of the Apple Watch
[02:05:00.220 --> 02:05:00.700]   project.
[02:05:00.700 --> 02:05:02.740]   I think they've got those two things pretty clearly.
[02:05:02.740 --> 02:05:06.260]   And the Apple TV for your head comes out next year?
[02:05:06.260 --> 02:05:09.700]   Yeah, I think it's the easier the two by far in terms of--
[02:05:09.700 --> 02:05:10.620]   They have the process--
[02:05:10.620 --> 02:05:11.420]   Existing technology.
[02:05:11.420 --> 02:05:12.340]   --or it and everything.
[02:05:12.340 --> 02:05:13.340]   Yeah.
[02:05:13.340 --> 02:05:13.860]   OK.
[02:05:13.860 --> 02:05:15.100]   It'll be really high end.
[02:05:15.100 --> 02:05:17.540]   That's going to buy you 8K displays for each eye.
[02:05:17.540 --> 02:05:19.820]   And it's going to buy you a lot of really good tech.
[02:05:19.820 --> 02:05:22.060]   But it's going to be a really good tech.
[02:05:22.060 --> 02:05:23.780]   And they were working on it since 2017.
[02:05:23.780 --> 02:05:25.780]   I mean, they famously were working with Valve for years.
[02:05:25.780 --> 02:05:28.860]   And then Johnny's like, we're not putting a helmet on somebody's
[02:05:28.860 --> 02:05:30.860]   head with a box by their foot.
[02:05:30.860 --> 02:05:32.260]   And they canceled that one.
[02:05:32.260 --> 02:05:35.700]   And now they had to restart everything.
[02:05:35.700 --> 02:05:38.020]   I think it's exactly how he said it.
[02:05:38.020 --> 02:05:39.420]   He's making Ferraris now, too.
[02:05:39.420 --> 02:05:39.980]   So like he said--
[02:05:39.980 --> 02:05:40.980]   I saw.
[02:05:40.980 --> 02:05:49.620]   So what does Apple have to announce this year?
[02:05:49.620 --> 02:05:51.980]   Are they going to do iPad Pros?
[02:05:51.980 --> 02:05:53.700]   I think the Mac Mini will--
[02:05:53.700 --> 02:05:54.940]   The higher end Mac Mini.
[02:05:54.940 --> 02:05:56.420]   I think the 32-inch--
[02:05:56.420 --> 02:05:58.700]   I Mac has to come out, doesn't it?
[02:05:58.700 --> 02:06:00.500]   That sounds like it's coming early next spring.
[02:06:00.500 --> 02:06:02.580]   Like it took so much work to get the 24-inch out
[02:06:02.580 --> 02:06:04.300]   that it's going to come to early next spring.
[02:06:04.300 --> 02:06:06.220]   The iPad is for next year because they just announced one
[02:06:06.220 --> 02:06:06.660]   in April.
[02:06:06.660 --> 02:06:08.740]   And the new one sounds like a much bigger update
[02:06:08.740 --> 02:06:11.220]   with wireless charging, well inductive charging,
[02:06:11.220 --> 02:06:12.380]   and all those kinds of things.
[02:06:12.380 --> 02:06:13.060]   So I feel like--
[02:06:13.060 --> 02:06:15.660]   iPads already, the rumor was iPads and Macs.
[02:06:15.660 --> 02:06:18.180]   At this point, Intel, Macs have--
[02:06:18.180 --> 02:06:22.540]   sales have to got too slow to a trickle, I feel like, right?
[02:06:22.540 --> 02:06:24.420]   The people who are buying them are like the Alex--
[02:06:24.420 --> 02:06:26.660]   I don't want to stereotype, but like the Alex Lindsay
[02:06:26.660 --> 02:06:28.060]   Studio types who just-- they want
[02:06:28.060 --> 02:06:29.700]   to stay on Intel for three more years
[02:06:29.700 --> 02:06:32.140]   to get past their software transition times.
[02:06:32.140 --> 02:06:33.420]   And they want really big boxes.
[02:06:33.420 --> 02:06:35.060]   So there's still buying.
[02:06:35.060 --> 02:06:38.820]   I don't know anybody buying Intel anything at this point.
[02:06:38.820 --> 02:06:41.100]   Other than there's a heavy compatibility issue,
[02:06:41.100 --> 02:06:43.460]   the one place that people are doing it is there's something
[02:06:43.460 --> 02:06:44.620]   where someone's already--
[02:06:44.620 --> 02:06:46.100]   It's using Pro Tools.
[02:06:46.100 --> 02:06:47.300]   You're going to buy--
[02:06:47.300 --> 02:06:47.820]   And then tell them.
[02:06:47.820 --> 02:06:49.300]   Pro Tools, you're not going to buy anything.
[02:06:49.300 --> 02:06:50.340]   It's in house apps, I think.
[02:06:50.340 --> 02:06:52.060]   That's just because it's not by anything, yeah.
[02:06:52.060 --> 02:06:55.260]   You can't-- Pro Tools, I think, is still stuck in Mojave.
[02:06:55.260 --> 02:06:58.780]   So I think that you can't buy really any piece of hardware.
[02:06:58.780 --> 02:07:00.820]   So I think that it is--
[02:07:00.820 --> 02:07:02.620]   there are a handful of things people know.
[02:07:02.620 --> 02:07:04.060]   It's never going to work on an M1.
[02:07:04.060 --> 02:07:06.180]   And probably it'll go for another couple of years,
[02:07:06.180 --> 02:07:07.940]   or not never, but won't anytime soon.
[02:07:07.940 --> 02:07:08.700]   We have to buy.
[02:07:08.700 --> 02:07:09.540]   So maybe that makes sense.
[02:07:09.540 --> 02:07:11.740]   We have to buy it because it's the only way for us to do it.
[02:07:11.740 --> 02:07:13.660]   But it's really gotten very-- and I
[02:07:13.660 --> 02:07:15.780]   think that what happened was a lot of us thought,
[02:07:15.780 --> 02:07:18.700]   when M1s came out, we thought, oh, that'll--
[02:07:18.700 --> 02:07:19.660]   this will be cute.
[02:07:19.660 --> 02:07:20.460]   They'll play with it.
[02:07:20.460 --> 02:07:22.420]   When we saw the performance, everyone stopped buying.
[02:07:22.420 --> 02:07:25.220]   Like everyone I know was like, no, no, no, no, no.
[02:07:25.220 --> 02:07:27.980]   Like we're not going to touch any of this anymore.
[02:07:27.980 --> 02:07:28.660]   And so that's--
[02:07:28.660 --> 02:07:29.980]   Which makes me feel like--
[02:07:29.980 --> 02:07:32.980]   the clock is ticking then because Apple needs
[02:07:32.980 --> 02:07:36.780]   to get a, for instance, a high-end iMac and a high-end Mac
[02:07:36.780 --> 02:07:37.260]   Mini out.
[02:07:37.260 --> 02:07:38.460]   It's the lie of next year, yeah.
[02:07:38.460 --> 02:07:39.380]   That's their team.
[02:07:39.380 --> 02:07:41.220]   I mean, what I will say is I'm kind of stunned
[02:07:41.220 --> 02:07:43.340]   by what I'm doing with the Mac Mini.
[02:07:43.340 --> 02:07:44.980]   Like I'm running Resolve for more than once.
[02:07:44.980 --> 02:07:46.340]   OK, so maybe you don't need it.
[02:07:46.340 --> 02:07:48.060]   No, that's what's scary about it is
[02:07:48.060 --> 02:07:51.060]   is that I have these little-- these tiny little computers
[02:07:51.060 --> 02:07:52.860]   that are doing incredible amounts of work.
[02:07:52.860 --> 02:07:54.340]   And so a lot of things we thought we
[02:07:54.340 --> 02:07:56.340]   had to do with an iMac, definitely an iMac.
[02:07:56.340 --> 02:07:58.900]   The Mac Pro, I think, is a different class.
[02:07:58.900 --> 02:08:02.340]   But my Mac Mini's are going way faster than any of the iMacs
[02:08:02.340 --> 02:08:03.420]   we've had.
[02:08:03.420 --> 02:08:06.860]   And who's buying an Intel Mac 16-inch MacBook Pro?
[02:08:06.860 --> 02:08:08.500]   Nobody, right?
[02:08:08.500 --> 02:08:11.820]   But I was hoping that we would see those this year.
[02:08:11.820 --> 02:08:12.620]   So let's--
[02:08:12.620 --> 02:08:14.860]   Smilly LED sounds like a pushback.
[02:08:14.860 --> 02:08:17.660]   Oh, maybe that's the thing that's the wild card,
[02:08:17.660 --> 02:08:18.660]   isn't it?
[02:08:18.660 --> 02:08:21.180]   Is chip shortages, COVID, and any LED?
[02:08:21.180 --> 02:08:22.180]   Yeah.
[02:08:22.180 --> 02:08:24.620]   And the other thing that might complicate this
[02:08:24.620 --> 02:08:26.940]   is that how much of this is absolutely
[02:08:26.940 --> 02:08:29.300]   considered this to be a rollout of a new Mac Mini
[02:08:29.300 --> 02:08:31.500]   or in a new 16-inch MacBook Pro.
[02:08:31.500 --> 02:08:33.540]   And how much of this is going to be invested
[02:08:33.540 --> 02:08:38.260]   as a rollout of the new M1X, the new M2?
[02:08:38.260 --> 02:08:40.380]   Here's the next generation or the second evolution
[02:08:40.380 --> 02:08:41.860]   of our Apple Silicon.
[02:08:41.860 --> 02:08:43.540]   And how much work are they going to have to do?
[02:08:43.540 --> 02:08:45.340]   They think they want to do to say, here's--
[02:08:45.340 --> 02:08:46.300]   we had a great start.
[02:08:46.300 --> 02:08:47.020]   Here are the numbers.
[02:08:47.020 --> 02:08:47.780]   Everyone loves it.
[02:08:47.780 --> 02:08:49.020]   Now, here's how much better it is.
[02:08:49.020 --> 02:08:50.580]   Here's what we've been able to expand.
[02:08:50.580 --> 02:08:53.420]   And does that mean that they don't want to do a subtle thing?
[02:08:53.420 --> 02:08:58.500]   They really want to do a cannonball sort of announcement
[02:08:58.500 --> 02:09:00.580]   that makes people realize that, yeah, Apple
[02:09:00.580 --> 02:09:02.980]   is where it's at for the future.
[02:09:02.980 --> 02:09:06.460]   All right, let's get to our picks of the week.
[02:09:06.460 --> 02:09:08.420]   Next is Mac Break Weekly.
[02:09:08.420 --> 02:09:09.180]   Continues.
[02:09:09.180 --> 02:09:16.140]   Since we ruined your pick of the week, Alex, let's see.
[02:09:16.140 --> 02:09:16.980]   Do you want to--
[02:09:16.980 --> 02:09:18.020]   I'm so sorry.
[02:09:18.020 --> 02:09:20.060]   Do you want to do anything or just refer people
[02:09:20.060 --> 02:09:21.420]   to earlier in the show?
[02:09:21.420 --> 02:09:23.780]   I'll give you the one that was going to happen.
[02:09:23.780 --> 02:09:27.100]   There was one before that one that I was listing.
[02:09:27.100 --> 02:09:28.940]   I don't have it in the rundown.
[02:09:28.940 --> 02:09:29.980]   That's fine.
[02:09:29.980 --> 02:09:34.260]   I was going to recommend the Monoprice Blackbird 8x8
[02:09:34.260 --> 02:09:37.060]   Matrix, which is more expensive than keynote.
[02:09:37.060 --> 02:09:38.140]   It's about 800 bucks.
[02:09:38.140 --> 02:09:40.860]   It is an 8x8 matrix for HDMI.
[02:09:40.860 --> 02:09:44.020]   A lot of us have routers for SDI.
[02:09:44.020 --> 02:09:46.620]   And I needed a router for HDMI.
[02:09:46.620 --> 02:09:48.460]   And what it does is it lets me take all my computers
[02:09:48.460 --> 02:09:50.940]   and feed them all into one place and then say, OK,
[02:09:50.940 --> 02:09:52.220]   I've got eight different places.
[02:09:52.220 --> 02:09:54.260]   It might be my ATEM Mini.
[02:09:54.260 --> 02:09:55.580]   It might be other monitors.
[02:09:55.580 --> 02:09:59.460]   And I want to push any one of these signals, my PC,
[02:09:59.460 --> 02:10:02.140]   my various Mac minis, my iMac, whatever.
[02:10:02.140 --> 02:10:05.140]   I want to put this over here on this thing.
[02:10:05.140 --> 02:10:07.340]   And so I don't have to figure out what I'm plugging in.
[02:10:07.340 --> 02:10:09.540]   Once you have the matrix, you can just sit there and just plug
[02:10:09.540 --> 02:10:09.940]   in.
[02:10:09.940 --> 02:10:11.940]   I just want to send this to that and send this to this.
[02:10:11.940 --> 02:10:13.900]   And if I don't like it, I don't have to figure out
[02:10:13.900 --> 02:10:14.660]   how to rewire it.
[02:10:14.660 --> 02:10:16.460]   They're all wired into the system.
[02:10:16.460 --> 02:10:20.500]   So it makes organizing screens, which
[02:10:20.500 --> 02:10:22.620]   I have a lot of here.
[02:10:22.620 --> 02:10:24.100]   Very easy.
[02:10:24.100 --> 02:10:29.580]   So anyway, it also supports all the protocols
[02:10:29.580 --> 02:10:30.700]   that you need, which is hard.
[02:10:30.700 --> 02:10:34.260]   Getting it to pass data through them--
[02:10:34.260 --> 02:10:37.620]   ADID, HDR, those types of things are a little complicated.
[02:10:37.620 --> 02:10:41.500]   And Monoprice keeps on adding what they're doing.
[02:10:41.500 --> 02:10:42.020]   They're kind of--
[02:10:42.020 --> 02:10:44.700]   I shouldn't be afraid buying it from a low-cost leader.
[02:10:44.700 --> 02:10:49.820]   I mean, it's a little wonky in the sense that, oh, you push
[02:10:49.820 --> 02:10:51.540]   a button and push a button and hit Enter.
[02:10:51.540 --> 02:10:53.100]   There's no nice interface and everything else.
[02:10:53.100 --> 02:10:56.020]   But generally, when I plugged it in, it just works.
[02:10:56.020 --> 02:11:03.260]   And so there have been a couple formats from the Mac Mini
[02:11:03.260 --> 02:11:04.580]   that have it go a little.
[02:11:04.580 --> 02:11:07.380]   It gets a little confused.
[02:11:07.380 --> 02:11:11.100]   But what I will say is it makes it a lot easier for me
[02:11:11.100 --> 02:11:12.260]   to get my signals--
[02:11:12.260 --> 02:11:12.700]   Hate it, yeah.
[02:11:12.700 --> 02:11:14.140]   --of where I tried like them.
[02:11:14.140 --> 02:11:15.980]   Yeah, so it's pretty cool.
[02:11:15.980 --> 02:11:18.020]   And only $850?
[02:11:18.020 --> 02:11:19.540]   It was down to $550.
[02:11:19.540 --> 02:11:20.460]   It went back to $850.
[02:11:20.460 --> 02:11:21.340]   So it was--
[02:11:21.340 --> 02:11:22.740]   What's out of stock right now, though?
[02:11:22.740 --> 02:11:23.500]   That may be--
[02:11:23.500 --> 02:11:24.660]   That's probably why it's $850.
[02:11:24.660 --> 02:11:25.500]   Yeah, another chip shift.
[02:11:25.500 --> 02:11:28.580]   There's a bunch of us in office hours that were--
[02:11:28.580 --> 02:11:29.740]   it was like, is it working?
[02:11:29.740 --> 02:11:30.180]   Is it working?
[02:11:30.180 --> 02:11:30.580]   Is it working?
[02:11:30.580 --> 02:11:31.660]   And we decided it was working.
[02:11:31.660 --> 02:11:33.420]   And then I think a bunch of people bought them.
[02:11:33.420 --> 02:11:34.780]   And it's probably why they're so low.
[02:11:34.780 --> 02:11:37.020]   I should have given this pick to you,
[02:11:37.020 --> 02:11:38.460]   because I don't know anything about it.
[02:11:38.460 --> 02:11:40.740]   But I did notice that they are--
[02:11:40.740 --> 02:11:43.340]   Trimble is now, which bought SketchUp from Google,
[02:11:43.340 --> 02:11:45.060]   is now doing an iPad version.
[02:11:45.060 --> 02:11:46.860]   It's in beta.
[02:11:46.860 --> 02:11:48.180]   Do you ever use SketchUp?
[02:11:48.180 --> 02:11:48.780]   It's a--
[02:11:48.780 --> 02:11:49.500]   Oh, yeah.
[02:11:49.500 --> 02:11:50.220]   SketchUp's great.
[02:11:50.220 --> 02:11:52.580]   Do you recommend?
[02:11:52.580 --> 02:11:54.300]   I haven't seen the one on the iPad,
[02:11:54.300 --> 02:11:56.380]   but SketchUp is a super great program
[02:11:56.380 --> 02:11:59.100]   for being able to basically sketch out.
[02:11:59.100 --> 02:12:00.540]   Wouldn't it be great on your iPad?
[02:12:00.540 --> 02:12:02.740]   It seems like it would be--
[02:12:02.740 --> 02:12:05.260]   Most of the 3D stuff has been really hard to do that way,
[02:12:05.260 --> 02:12:07.380]   because you need more granular control
[02:12:07.380 --> 02:12:09.180]   over position of points and things.
[02:12:09.180 --> 02:12:11.220]   And so I have a hard time visualizing
[02:12:11.220 --> 02:12:13.420]   how I would create a SketchUp style model.
[02:12:13.420 --> 02:12:14.500]   It shows you how it works.
[02:12:14.500 --> 02:12:15.700]   Yeah, it's on a side right now.
[02:12:15.700 --> 02:12:16.860]   But definitely check it out.
[02:12:16.860 --> 02:12:18.140]   I'll definitely check it out.
[02:12:18.140 --> 02:12:20.300]   It hasn't been-- that part--
[02:12:20.300 --> 02:12:22.500]   SketchUp is probably the most likely to do well,
[02:12:22.500 --> 02:12:25.020]   because it kind of does a lot of things that are automatic.
[02:12:25.020 --> 02:12:27.980]   But it's been my experience with using 3D apps
[02:12:27.980 --> 02:12:31.980]   on the iPad so far has not been incredible.
[02:12:31.980 --> 02:12:34.500]   So but I'm willing to try it, because SketchUp is a great app
[02:12:34.500 --> 02:12:36.100]   that we definitely use for a lot of things.
[02:12:36.100 --> 02:12:37.460]   Good.
[02:12:37.460 --> 02:12:39.860]   So Trimble has done a good job with the acquisition.
[02:12:39.860 --> 02:12:41.540]   They've kept it up.
[02:12:41.540 --> 02:12:42.540]   Yeah.
[02:12:42.540 --> 02:12:45.660]   I was a little nervous when Google sold it.
[02:12:45.660 --> 02:12:47.100]   It fits into their overall ecosystem.
[02:12:47.100 --> 02:12:50.140]   They make a lot of engineering tools.
[02:12:50.140 --> 02:12:51.740]   We were working with other Trimble.
[02:12:51.740 --> 02:12:54.300]   I was in there the Trimble Business Center.
[02:12:54.300 --> 02:12:56.460]   There are 3D apps called the Business Center.
[02:12:56.460 --> 02:12:58.580]   Anyway, so TBC is this--
[02:12:58.580 --> 02:13:00.140]   what it does, it takes in all this data.
[02:13:00.140 --> 02:13:03.980]   So you're taking in scanning, like big LiDAR scans.
[02:13:03.980 --> 02:13:06.340]   And you're able to process them and make it all work.
[02:13:06.340 --> 02:13:08.460]   But it's this huge data processing thing
[02:13:08.460 --> 02:13:11.100]   for scanning and site surveys and everything else.
[02:13:11.100 --> 02:13:13.580]   And it's called the Business Center.
[02:13:13.580 --> 02:13:15.500]   My friend Fred and I were talking about it yesterday,
[02:13:15.500 --> 02:13:17.700]   because we were scanning something in Monterey yesterday.
[02:13:17.700 --> 02:13:21.020]   And we were talking about the Trimble Business Center.
[02:13:21.020 --> 02:13:22.100]   But they do a lot.
[02:13:22.100 --> 02:13:24.740]   So SketchUp fits into their overall model,
[02:13:24.740 --> 02:13:27.300]   because a lot of their other stuff is in surveying,
[02:13:27.300 --> 02:13:31.260]   and in BIM, and a lot of other things that are there.
[02:13:31.260 --> 02:13:34.060]   And so the front end of that being SketchUp totally makes sense.
[02:13:34.060 --> 02:13:35.820]   It's not something that they just bought.
[02:13:35.820 --> 02:13:37.700]   It's something that fits into a lot of the other things
[02:13:37.700 --> 02:13:38.540]   that they're doing.
[02:13:38.540 --> 02:13:39.820]   Yeah, obviously it was a GPS company.
[02:13:39.820 --> 02:13:41.340]   But they say, really, they are a--
[02:13:41.340 --> 02:13:44.900]   I love this-- positioning centric information
[02:13:44.900 --> 02:13:45.940]   company.
[02:13:45.940 --> 02:13:47.820]   Yeah, I mean, like, what we use--
[02:13:47.820 --> 02:13:50.220]   to give you an example of it, we use this thing called an asset.
[02:13:50.220 --> 02:13:52.860]   We've used this thing called an SX10, which is a--
[02:13:52.860 --> 02:13:54.940]   it's a survey tool that also has a scanner,
[02:13:54.940 --> 02:13:57.340]   and it'll do about 60,000 points on a site.
[02:13:57.340 --> 02:13:57.860]   Wow.
[02:13:57.860 --> 02:14:00.460]   And what it does, though, is because it's got a survey tool,
[02:14:00.460 --> 02:14:03.460]   you can mark it against a reflector.
[02:14:03.460 --> 02:14:05.140]   So you can be-- we were doing a golf course.
[02:14:05.140 --> 02:14:06.740]   And basically, you're in one part of the golf course.
[02:14:06.740 --> 02:14:08.940]   And someone else is like 300 meters away.
[02:14:08.940 --> 02:14:10.940]   And you can cite it in with the scanner
[02:14:10.940 --> 02:14:15.460]   so that you can tell where that scanner was in the world.
[02:14:15.460 --> 02:14:19.780]   And you have a GPS receiver that basically that that marker
[02:14:19.780 --> 02:14:22.980]   is based on via radio connections and so on and so forth.
[02:14:22.980 --> 02:14:28.500]   And so you can create super accurate models over miles
[02:14:28.500 --> 02:14:29.980]   that you can-- or square miles--
[02:14:29.980 --> 02:14:31.180]   that you can put together.
[02:14:31.180 --> 02:14:36.060]   And so they make these really heavy duty solutions
[02:14:36.060 --> 02:14:40.980]   for really high accuracy survey work.
[02:14:40.980 --> 02:14:43.260]   And then they let you process all those point clouds
[02:14:43.260 --> 02:14:44.780]   and all that other stuff.
[02:14:44.780 --> 02:14:46.660]   It's a very-- it's a big company.
[02:14:46.660 --> 02:14:47.980]   They do a lot of cool things.
[02:14:47.980 --> 02:14:49.700]   Nice.
[02:14:49.700 --> 02:14:50.580]   Alex-- I'm sorry.
[02:14:50.580 --> 02:14:51.700]   That was Alex.
[02:14:51.700 --> 02:14:52.260]   Who are you?
[02:14:52.260 --> 02:14:54.180]   Andy.
[02:14:54.180 --> 02:14:55.100]   I wish him or Alex.
[02:14:55.100 --> 02:14:56.180]   You're sick of the week.
[02:14:56.180 --> 02:14:58.140]   Don't we all?
[02:14:58.140 --> 02:15:02.540]   Mine is a video that just dropped on YouTube this morning
[02:15:02.540 --> 02:15:05.900]   that I've already watched twice because my goodness--
[02:15:05.900 --> 02:15:08.500]   if you're involved in a lifestyle that has projects
[02:15:08.500 --> 02:15:10.980]   that have to get done and a lifestyle that might
[02:15:10.980 --> 02:15:14.300]   kind of be organized around getting these projects done,
[02:15:14.300 --> 02:15:16.940]   this video is just so filled with so many things
[02:15:16.940 --> 02:15:18.940]   that will make you pause and rethink
[02:15:18.940 --> 02:15:22.820]   how you want to run your entire week and your entire project.
[02:15:22.820 --> 02:15:25.220]   Martin Molland is the designer and builder
[02:15:25.220 --> 02:15:26.860]   of the Marble Machine.
[02:15:26.860 --> 02:15:30.220]   The 800 million views on YouTube is that machine that
[02:15:30.220 --> 02:15:32.780]   plays music by just dropping marbles onto a silo cool
[02:15:32.780 --> 02:15:33.260]   and on those--
[02:15:33.260 --> 02:15:33.780]   Yeah.
[02:15:33.780 --> 02:15:34.820]   --and so, so cool.
[02:15:34.820 --> 02:15:36.980]   So for the past few years, he has been working on what
[02:15:36.980 --> 02:15:39.860]   he calls Marble Machine X, which is the much, much better
[02:15:39.860 --> 02:15:42.980]   version of this that he wants to take on tour
[02:15:42.980 --> 02:15:44.460]   with his band.
[02:15:44.460 --> 02:15:47.500]   And so he took a couple months off for vacation
[02:15:47.500 --> 02:15:51.100]   and then came back with this video that basically said that,
[02:15:51.100 --> 02:15:53.820]   OK, I'm going to finish Marble Machine X.
[02:15:53.820 --> 02:15:55.460]   Instead of taking on tour, all I'm
[02:15:55.460 --> 02:15:58.380]   going to do is play and record one song and one video with it
[02:15:58.380 --> 02:15:59.500]   and then move on.
[02:15:59.500 --> 02:16:02.860]   And this video talks all about what
[02:16:02.860 --> 02:16:06.180]   he's been learning about project management, big projects,
[02:16:06.180 --> 02:16:07.740]   and how to run these things.
[02:16:07.740 --> 02:16:10.700]   And this isn't just someone saying
[02:16:10.700 --> 02:16:13.780]   that pontificating from a sofa with a glass of brandy.
[02:16:13.780 --> 02:16:15.060]   He's talking about here is what I've
[02:16:15.060 --> 02:16:16.500]   learned over the past three or four years.
[02:16:16.500 --> 02:16:18.220]   Here are the things that have been holding me back.
[02:16:18.220 --> 02:16:20.820]   Here have been things that I'm still kind of struggling with.
[02:16:20.820 --> 02:16:23.860]   And here are other people who write about these topics
[02:16:23.860 --> 02:16:25.820]   that have been teaching me things that are kind of kind
[02:16:25.820 --> 02:16:26.500]   of interesting.
[02:16:26.500 --> 02:16:30.860]   And he makes these four points that just to summarize that,
[02:16:30.860 --> 02:16:32.620]   number one, he says the problems he was having
[02:16:32.620 --> 02:16:34.700]   with the Marble Machine X was that number one,
[02:16:34.700 --> 02:16:37.180]   he didn't make the requirements less dumb,
[02:16:37.180 --> 02:16:39.980]   meaning that he's been trying to solve problems that
[02:16:39.980 --> 02:16:42.980]   are all associated with an early decision that, hey,
[02:16:42.980 --> 02:16:46.100]   the mechanism for taking the marbles from the bottom of the chain
[02:16:46.100 --> 02:16:47.860]   and moving them up to the top of the machine
[02:16:47.860 --> 02:16:49.260]   so gravity can move them down.
[02:16:49.260 --> 02:16:52.900]   It's supers-- he did that because he picked a mechanism that
[02:16:52.900 --> 02:16:55.060]   would look really, really cool on stage.
[02:16:55.060 --> 02:16:57.860]   And for the three years, he's been battling problems created
[02:16:57.860 --> 02:17:00.220]   by the fact he's got this super cool looking,
[02:17:00.220 --> 02:17:02.900]   but inefficient and easy to break down mechanism.
[02:17:02.900 --> 02:17:06.460]   He identifies that as if he had made the requirements less
[02:17:06.460 --> 02:17:08.500]   dumb, saying the purpose of this mechanism
[02:17:08.500 --> 02:17:11.260]   is to get marbles from the bottom to the top,
[02:17:11.260 --> 02:17:13.300]   and it has to do so reliably, he would not
[02:17:13.300 --> 02:17:14.740]   be working on these sort of things.
[02:17:14.740 --> 02:17:16.460]   And he gives a couple of examples.
[02:17:16.460 --> 02:17:19.460]   Working on too many non-essential things,
[02:17:19.460 --> 02:17:24.100]   things that include making videos every single week.
[02:17:24.100 --> 02:17:27.420]   But one of the things that has really kind of also
[02:17:27.420 --> 02:17:30.180]   triggered with me is the difference between shallow work
[02:17:30.180 --> 02:17:32.060]   and deep work, which is something he was getting off
[02:17:32.060 --> 02:17:34.700]   of another book that he had read that he links to.
[02:17:34.700 --> 02:17:38.380]   The idea that we all kind of know that multitasking is a fraud.
[02:17:38.380 --> 02:17:40.500]   We really can't do several things at once.
[02:17:40.500 --> 02:17:42.300]   But the way that he articulates this
[02:17:42.300 --> 02:17:46.020]   and explains this in the way that you can either make
[02:17:46.020 --> 02:17:49.940]   a micro-- infinitesimal progress on 10 things today,
[02:17:49.940 --> 02:17:54.380]   or you can make deep progress on one thing today that will not
[02:17:54.380 --> 02:17:57.260]   only be-- it will satisfy your soul in a much more
[02:17:57.260 --> 02:17:59.580]   found way to say that, no, this thing that was not working
[02:17:59.580 --> 02:18:01.060]   before is now working.
[02:18:01.060 --> 02:18:04.100]   This problem that was not solved is now solved.
[02:18:04.100 --> 02:18:07.380]   And also, it helps you to get to the state of mental flow that
[02:18:07.380 --> 02:18:10.180]   keeps you kind of meditative and happy.
[02:18:10.180 --> 02:18:12.820]   The other thing that related to this that kind of hit with me
[02:18:12.820 --> 02:18:16.020]   was he showed-- I guess he tracks his time
[02:18:16.020 --> 02:18:18.900]   or plans to schedule with Google Calendar.
[02:18:18.900 --> 02:18:21.700]   And he has the weekly view where he has every single task.
[02:18:21.700 --> 02:18:23.580]   He's a different color in this bar.
[02:18:23.580 --> 02:18:27.020]   And how before all the tasks he was at was like,
[02:18:27.020 --> 02:18:30.860]   you see this sort of plaid stripe of different colors,
[02:18:30.860 --> 02:18:32.300]   each representing a different thing,
[02:18:32.300 --> 02:18:34.580]   and that he has now redone this so that it's just--
[02:18:34.580 --> 02:18:37.500]   here's a big block of blue, then a big block of red,
[02:18:37.500 --> 02:18:39.380]   then another big block of green.
[02:18:39.380 --> 02:18:41.900]   And it just made me realize that there are oftentimes
[02:18:41.900 --> 02:18:43.820]   where I've got the morning set to--
[02:18:43.820 --> 02:18:45.500]   I get through there-- there are four or five different things
[02:18:45.500 --> 02:18:48.460]   I have to make progress on before I take lunch,
[02:18:48.460 --> 02:18:50.940]   then after lunch, maybe I'll spend two hours writing this
[02:18:50.940 --> 02:18:52.140]   or building that.
[02:18:52.140 --> 02:18:54.700]   And it really does give a lot of insights
[02:18:54.700 --> 02:18:59.460]   on why work is not the same thing as accomplishment,
[02:18:59.460 --> 02:19:02.100]   why the amount of pleasure and satisfaction you get
[02:19:02.100 --> 02:19:04.460]   will help you to do better work, and how sometimes you
[02:19:04.460 --> 02:19:07.420]   have to just be brave enough to say that this thing--
[02:19:07.420 --> 02:19:09.980]   this thing that was part of my initial design
[02:19:09.980 --> 02:19:11.980]   that I've been holding on to for two years
[02:19:11.980 --> 02:19:13.420]   has been nothing but causing problems.
[02:19:13.420 --> 02:19:16.620]   If I got rid of this, realize this is a dumb requirement
[02:19:16.620 --> 02:19:18.580]   that I shouldn't have to deal with,
[02:19:18.580 --> 02:19:19.860]   I should go ahead and do that.
[02:19:19.860 --> 02:19:21.580]   So it's kind of heartbreaking that--
[02:19:21.580 --> 02:19:24.100]   I was looking forward to after the break saying, OK,
[02:19:24.100 --> 02:19:25.340]   "Morrow Machine X is all done."
[02:19:25.340 --> 02:19:28.140]   And so now, here's going to be our big 10 album--
[02:19:28.140 --> 02:19:30.020]   10 tracks I'm going to be recording with it.
[02:19:30.020 --> 02:19:31.780]   I was not expecting to hear, yeah, you're
[02:19:31.780 --> 02:19:33.420]   going to see this in one video once.
[02:19:33.420 --> 02:19:34.900]   You're going to have one piece of music.
[02:19:34.900 --> 02:19:37.460]   And then I will start working on what he calls
[02:19:37.460 --> 02:19:40.980]   "Morrow Machine X-T" or the Turing version of the "Morrow Machine."
[02:19:40.980 --> 02:19:43.260]   But with all of these different factors
[02:19:43.260 --> 02:19:45.020]   working into his work view.
[02:19:45.020 --> 02:19:46.700]   Again, I'm really recommending strongly
[02:19:46.700 --> 02:19:48.580]   that you watch the entire thing, because he
[02:19:48.580 --> 02:19:51.740]   is an exceptionally good filmmaker, top of everything else.
[02:19:51.740 --> 02:19:53.220]   He knows how to communicate.
[02:19:53.220 --> 02:19:55.500]   And once again, it's not-- again, I
[02:19:55.500 --> 02:20:00.300]   have such low tolerance for productivity YouTube channels,
[02:20:00.300 --> 02:20:02.660]   because, OK, great, you're an expert on productivity,
[02:20:02.660 --> 02:20:05.580]   but all you do is talk about productivity.
[02:20:05.580 --> 02:20:08.020]   You're not-- that's like being a writer who does nothing
[02:20:08.020 --> 02:20:09.940]   but writing about writers who write.
[02:20:09.940 --> 02:20:12.100]   It's not nothing, but it's not probably
[02:20:12.100 --> 02:20:13.220]   the most helpful position.
[02:20:13.220 --> 02:20:16.340]   He is someone who's tackled this enormous project
[02:20:16.340 --> 02:20:18.660]   and has realized, here's where I screwed up
[02:20:18.660 --> 02:20:20.020]   at multiple occasions.
[02:20:20.020 --> 02:20:22.740]   Here's where I would like to relaunch it moving forward.
[02:20:22.740 --> 02:20:25.540]   And he's saying things that make sense to someone who is not
[02:20:25.540 --> 02:20:30.660]   using CNC and welding and CAD and all kinds of other things
[02:20:30.660 --> 02:20:33.700]   to build a ridiculous machine that drops marbles on xylophones
[02:20:33.700 --> 02:20:34.940]   to make beautiful music.
[02:20:34.940 --> 02:20:35.940]   So high recommendation.
[02:20:35.940 --> 02:20:39.460]   And of course, he has inspired so many, like this TikToker,
[02:20:39.460 --> 02:20:42.380]   who created his own marble machine.
[02:20:42.380 --> 02:20:43.540]   John, if you would.
[02:20:43.540 --> 02:20:44.540]   Yeah.
[02:20:44.540 --> 02:20:46.540]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:20:46.540 --> 02:20:49.540]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[02:20:49.540 --> 02:20:52.540]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[02:20:52.540 --> 02:20:54.540]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[02:20:54.540 --> 02:20:57.540]   Anything that uses reasonable rubber chickens is reasonable.
[02:20:57.540 --> 02:20:59.540]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[02:20:59.540 --> 02:21:01.060]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:21:01.060 --> 02:21:02.940]   That's a marble machine.
[02:21:02.940 --> 02:21:06.660]   Those were rubber chickens, by the way, performing.
[02:21:06.660 --> 02:21:07.820]   I think he Rick rolled this.
[02:21:07.820 --> 02:21:10.260]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:21:10.260 --> 02:21:13.180]   Renee Richie, you're picking the week.
[02:21:13.180 --> 02:21:17.060]   So for a very long time, I have been lobbying downright
[02:21:17.060 --> 02:21:20.100]   begging Apple to bring this feature from Logic Pro
[02:21:20.100 --> 02:21:22.620]   called Strip Silence to Final Cut Pro.
[02:21:22.620 --> 02:21:24.700]   If you're not familiar with it, it lets you choose an area
[02:21:24.700 --> 02:21:27.340]   of audio, and it'll just automatically cut it for you
[02:21:27.340 --> 02:21:28.980]   wherever there is a break in the audio.
[02:21:28.980 --> 02:21:31.620]   In our case, like for podcasts, if there's silence
[02:21:31.620 --> 02:21:35.020]   in the timeline for that specific track,
[02:21:35.020 --> 02:21:37.060]   it'll just cut it up, and then you can go and delete it
[02:21:37.060 --> 02:21:38.660]   so you don't get background noise,
[02:21:38.660 --> 02:21:40.700]   or if you want to bring things closer together,
[02:21:40.700 --> 02:21:43.380]   it's a little bit of automation that makes your life easier.
[02:21:43.380 --> 02:21:45.900]   And Final Cut Pro does not have this feature,
[02:21:45.900 --> 02:21:47.940]   but this morning someone tweeted out to me
[02:21:47.940 --> 02:21:49.540]   an app called Recut.
[02:21:49.540 --> 02:21:52.580]   It's not a plug-in, which I'd much prefer to have,
[02:21:52.580 --> 02:21:53.820]   but it's a standalone app.
[02:21:53.820 --> 02:21:57.020]   You drag your video there, and it does all that cutting for you,
[02:21:57.020 --> 02:21:59.820]   and you can go in and say, no, leave this, no, get rid of that,
[02:21:59.820 --> 02:22:01.180]   no, you do all of this.
[02:22:01.180 --> 02:22:04.020]   So you can basically edit to do all the cuts for you,
[02:22:04.020 --> 02:22:05.300]   and edit them the way you need it,
[02:22:05.300 --> 02:22:08.020]   and then you can export it for Premiere or Resolve
[02:22:08.020 --> 02:22:09.700]   or Final Cut Pro.
[02:22:09.700 --> 02:22:15.420]   And for example, I'm working on my A15 Deep Dive right now,
[02:22:15.420 --> 02:22:17.380]   my A15 Bionic Deep Dive right now,
[02:22:17.380 --> 02:22:19.300]   and the A-roll that I recorded for it,
[02:22:19.300 --> 02:22:21.580]   the video of my talking head, I recorded for it,
[02:22:21.580 --> 02:22:22.780]   it's 52 minutes.
[02:22:22.780 --> 02:22:24.380]   The video's gonna end up being 20 minutes,
[02:22:24.380 --> 02:22:27.540]   but I broke sometimes, I had to double check things
[02:22:27.540 --> 02:22:30.620]   a few times, I flubbed all the time,
[02:22:30.620 --> 02:22:32.780]   so it goes on and on, and there are breaks in it,
[02:22:32.780 --> 02:22:35.340]   and a lot of my time is spent with the blade tool,
[02:22:35.340 --> 02:22:37.460]   cutting where the audio ends, cutting where it begins again.
[02:22:37.460 --> 02:22:39.220]   - Little trim. - Leading the part in between.
[02:22:39.220 --> 02:22:40.180]   - Yeah. - Yeah.
[02:22:40.180 --> 02:22:42.780]   And it's fast, you can do it with Command B,
[02:22:42.780 --> 02:22:46.100]   Command Square Bracket, and some people are really fast at it.
[02:22:46.100 --> 02:22:49.180]   Nobody's fast as the machine, just doing it for you.
[02:22:49.180 --> 02:22:51.940]   - How does it know where to cut though?
[02:22:51.940 --> 02:22:54.820]   - You can set a limit, you can say immediately after silent,
[02:22:54.820 --> 02:22:56.980]   like immediately when the voice drops to your silence.
[02:22:56.980 --> 02:23:01.580]   - So it's using silence as the indicator.
[02:23:01.580 --> 02:23:03.460]   - Cool, that's really interesting.
[02:23:03.460 --> 02:23:06.740]   - So this way you kinda have the sloppy early cut,
[02:23:06.740 --> 02:23:09.300]   and then it tends it all up, basically.
[02:23:09.300 --> 02:23:11.020]   - Yeah, yeah, I mean, I don't have the pressure
[02:23:11.020 --> 02:23:12.780]   of live video like we do on Mac Break Weekly,
[02:23:12.780 --> 02:23:14.940]   I can fix it all. - This is why I don't care.
[02:23:14.940 --> 02:23:17.260]   - 'Cause I like silence.
[02:23:17.260 --> 02:23:18.100]   (laughs)
[02:23:18.100 --> 02:23:20.020]   I just insert myself in there. - But Jason's now looks like
[02:23:20.020 --> 02:23:22.340]   he's shown how he goes to a tracks of things,
[02:23:22.340 --> 02:23:25.140]   and he uses trips to silence, so he can remove back.
[02:23:25.140 --> 02:23:26.940]   'Cause sometimes people are eating chips in the background
[02:23:26.940 --> 02:23:29.620]   when they're not talking, and they just send you their track.
[02:23:29.620 --> 02:23:31.260]   There's all sorts of stuff you wanna clean up
[02:23:31.260 --> 02:23:32.700]   when you're doing multi-enders.
[02:23:32.700 --> 02:23:34.620]   And it's the same thing in video.
[02:23:34.620 --> 02:23:38.780]   - So no more tiny, fiddly, handcrafted cuts.
[02:23:38.780 --> 02:23:43.620]   Recut, it's 99 bucks, getrecut.com.
[02:23:43.620 --> 02:23:45.500]   - That is a free demo if you're not sure if it'll work.
[02:23:45.500 --> 02:23:47.700]   'Cause some people don't like XML in their workflow,
[02:23:47.700 --> 02:23:51.580]   it messes up their pristine management systems,
[02:23:51.580 --> 02:23:53.620]   but for some other people it'll be great.
[02:23:53.620 --> 02:23:54.740]   - I should send this to Henry,
[02:23:54.740 --> 02:23:57.460]   'cause it's pretty clear that in order to make his
[02:23:57.460 --> 02:24:00.700]   tight little TikToks, he's doing a lot of editing
[02:24:00.700 --> 02:24:02.140]   to cut stuff out. - Yeah, for sure.
[02:24:02.140 --> 02:24:04.860]   - Yeah, I will send him a link.
[02:24:04.860 --> 02:24:06.220]   Very good pick, thank you.
[02:24:06.220 --> 02:24:08.340]   Thanks to all three of you.
[02:24:08.340 --> 02:24:09.780]   Been a lot of fun, Renee Richie,
[02:24:09.780 --> 02:24:11.140]   what are you working on?
[02:24:11.140 --> 02:24:13.540]   YouTube.com/ReneeRitchie.
[02:24:13.540 --> 02:24:18.940]   - I am working on my massive Apple A15 Bionic Deep Dive.
[02:24:18.940 --> 02:24:19.780]   - Oh, can't wait.
[02:24:19.780 --> 02:24:22.460]   - It's about all the new Avalanche and Blizzard cores
[02:24:22.460 --> 02:24:26.420]   and the G14 GPU and just all the goodies.
[02:24:26.420 --> 02:24:28.540]   - How do you get, is there a white paper?
[02:24:28.540 --> 02:24:29.900]   You base it on your briefings?
[02:24:29.900 --> 02:24:33.900]   - No, briefings and like in a perfect world
[02:24:33.900 --> 02:24:35.620]   I'd wait for an Antech to publish first,
[02:24:35.620 --> 02:24:37.660]   but it can take them like three months
[02:24:37.660 --> 02:24:39.500]   to do a review of an iPhone.
[02:24:39.500 --> 02:24:41.780]   So I just, you know, I try to figure out as much as I can
[02:24:41.780 --> 02:24:43.620]   and I talk to as many people as I can
[02:24:43.620 --> 02:24:46.380]   and Apple publishes some TikToks, you know,
[02:24:46.380 --> 02:24:49.180]   which are helpful, but it's a lot of grunt work.
[02:24:49.180 --> 02:24:52.660]   - Look forward to it, YouTube.com/ReneeRitchie.
[02:24:52.660 --> 02:24:55.300]   Now with the silence is removed.
[02:24:55.300 --> 02:24:58.740]   Andy and Iko, when are you gonna be on WGBH next?
[02:24:58.740 --> 02:25:00.260]   - Just a little bit later this week,
[02:25:00.260 --> 02:25:03.020]   I'm on Friday as usual, but at 1.20 in the afternoon,
[02:25:03.020 --> 02:25:06.220]   just go to wgphnews.org to stream it live
[02:25:06.220 --> 02:25:07.340]   or stream it later.
[02:25:07.340 --> 02:25:09.180]   - Very nice.
[02:25:09.180 --> 02:25:12.300]   And Alex Lindsay, what's coming up on Office Hours,
[02:25:12.300 --> 02:25:13.660]   Office Hours.global?
[02:25:13.660 --> 02:25:16.540]   You're muted.
[02:25:16.540 --> 02:25:20.780]   - Today we spent nearly, we spent a whole hour
[02:25:20.780 --> 02:25:22.220]   so I was talking about the Baron deflow eight,
[02:25:22.220 --> 02:25:24.300]   we just under a second. - Oh my God.
[02:25:24.300 --> 02:25:26.100]   - And there was so much data.
[02:25:26.100 --> 02:25:28.780]   We went through like 40 questions, you know, inside of that.
[02:25:28.780 --> 02:25:31.580]   And anyway, and so, but--
[02:25:31.580 --> 02:25:34.460]   - This is a Bluetooth controlled digital mixer.
[02:25:34.460 --> 02:25:36.260]   - Yeah, it's really interesting mixer
[02:25:36.260 --> 02:25:38.180]   and so we just answered everybody's questions.
[02:25:38.180 --> 02:25:39.580]   Literally it was just one of us,
[02:25:39.580 --> 02:25:44.140]   Carl who knows a lot about,
[02:25:44.140 --> 02:25:45.540]   just sat there and answered everybody's questions.
[02:25:45.540 --> 02:25:47.100]   Literally any question you could think of,
[02:25:47.100 --> 02:25:48.820]   you just answered all of them at one time, you know,
[02:25:48.820 --> 02:25:50.820]   at one time and so 60 questions.
[02:25:50.820 --> 02:25:52.540]   - How does it work, Carl?
[02:25:52.540 --> 02:25:54.460]   How does it work? - Yeah, so anyway,
[02:25:54.460 --> 02:25:55.940]   so that was today,
[02:25:55.940 --> 02:25:58.460]   tomorrow we're doing what we call ruthless reviews.
[02:25:58.460 --> 02:26:00.100]   We literally go through the panel
[02:26:00.100 --> 02:26:01.980]   and just pick at everybody's video.
[02:26:01.980 --> 02:26:03.300]   - Oh my God.
[02:26:03.300 --> 02:26:04.540]   - This is how you get really,
[02:26:04.540 --> 02:26:06.100]   people with really a whole show
[02:26:06.100 --> 02:26:07.340]   with people who look really good
[02:26:07.340 --> 02:26:08.340]   is that we just pick at it.
[02:26:08.340 --> 02:26:10.980]   Like, you know, the light is a little off, you know,
[02:26:10.980 --> 02:26:12.460]   like in your background,
[02:26:12.460 --> 02:26:14.660]   this, it feels a little heavy to the right.
[02:26:14.660 --> 02:26:17.460]   So if you really wanna see people like pick at it,
[02:26:17.460 --> 02:26:18.300]   it's coming tomorrow.
[02:26:18.300 --> 02:26:21.060]   - I don't want anybody picking at my videos, thank you.
[02:26:21.060 --> 02:26:23.660]   - Thursday, Thursday we're talking about,
[02:26:23.660 --> 02:26:24.940]   how do people break into the industry?
[02:26:24.940 --> 02:26:26.260]   Like how do you actually get into it?
[02:26:26.260 --> 02:26:27.180]   So we'll just kind of do,
[02:26:27.180 --> 02:26:29.060]   talk about how people have gotten into industries
[02:26:29.060 --> 02:26:30.060]   that they weren't in.
[02:26:30.060 --> 02:26:31.380]   Friday we're talking about Isadora.
[02:26:31.380 --> 02:26:34.860]   Isadora is an incredible, incredibly cool,
[02:26:34.860 --> 02:26:38.340]   app mostly used in theater, it's a nodal controller.
[02:26:38.340 --> 02:26:40.860]   Like, and so in a lot of the new versions of what we're doing,
[02:26:40.860 --> 02:26:43.940]   you can have it take OSC and MIDI and all kinds of other things
[02:26:43.940 --> 02:26:46.140]   and just talk to everything and turn this on over here
[02:26:46.140 --> 02:26:47.500]   and turn that on over there.
[02:26:47.500 --> 02:26:49.900]   And so we're gonna have a bunch of the experts
[02:26:49.900 --> 02:26:51.220]   just again do Q and A.
[02:26:51.220 --> 02:26:53.700]   And then on Saturday we do education
[02:26:53.700 --> 02:26:55.100]   and then at noon we have,
[02:26:55.100 --> 02:26:56.940]   so we don't broadcast the education.
[02:26:56.940 --> 02:26:57.780]   So you never see it
[02:26:57.780 --> 02:27:00.180]   because the teachers wanted to be able to talk more frankly.
[02:27:00.180 --> 02:27:01.300]   - Oh, nice.
[02:27:01.300 --> 02:27:03.300]   - So that's a day to clock on Saturdays.
[02:27:03.300 --> 02:27:05.940]   - And you broadcast it, you don't record it.
[02:27:05.940 --> 02:27:06.940]   - It's in Zoom.
[02:27:06.940 --> 02:27:07.780]   - Oh.
[02:27:07.780 --> 02:27:09.100]   - So you could be there for it.
[02:27:09.100 --> 02:27:09.940]   - Ah.
[02:27:09.940 --> 02:27:11.020]   - You could be there for that one
[02:27:11.020 --> 02:27:12.780]   because we don't put it anywhere else.
[02:27:12.780 --> 02:27:16.140]   And then, but then it, also not on Zoom,
[02:27:16.140 --> 02:27:19.060]   but we recorded is the, the Belfat,
[02:27:19.060 --> 02:27:20.140]   what we call the Belfast Method,
[02:27:20.140 --> 02:27:23.620]   which is that we have a band playing in Belfast
[02:27:23.620 --> 02:27:25.660]   in a place called the Accidental Theater.
[02:27:25.660 --> 02:27:27.260]   And we have people running the show
[02:27:27.260 --> 02:27:28.060]   from all over the world.
[02:27:28.060 --> 02:27:30.660]   So they're switching the cameras and running the audio
[02:27:30.660 --> 02:27:31.740]   and doing all the other stuff
[02:27:31.740 --> 02:27:34.300]   from different parts of the world, you know, taking over.
[02:27:34.300 --> 02:27:36.820]   So they're, so you get to watch it from behind,
[02:27:36.820 --> 02:27:37.900]   you'll get to hear their comms
[02:27:37.900 --> 02:27:38.940]   while they're talking to each other
[02:27:38.940 --> 02:27:40.060]   and figuring out how to do it.
[02:27:40.060 --> 02:27:42.460]   And so it's going to be a busy week.
[02:27:42.460 --> 02:27:43.780]   - Very exciting.
[02:27:43.780 --> 02:27:45.860]   And you can get an invite to the Zoom
[02:27:45.860 --> 02:27:50.860]   as well as look at past videos at officehours.global.
[02:27:50.860 --> 02:27:53.820]   And of course, if you would like the trained professional
[02:27:53.820 --> 02:27:57.620]   Alex Lindsey working on your next thing,
[02:27:57.620 --> 02:28:00.500]   go to 090.media.
[02:28:00.500 --> 02:28:01.340]   - We do.
[02:28:01.340 --> 02:28:02.540]   - We do some cool stuff.
[02:28:02.540 --> 02:28:03.740]   - Very cool stuff.
[02:28:03.740 --> 02:28:05.420]   - We did what ride, wide range.
[02:28:05.420 --> 02:28:08.380]   We had a company that had to,
[02:28:08.380 --> 02:28:10.420]   a group had to figure out how to do voting
[02:28:10.420 --> 02:28:12.020]   and everything else on Zoom on one weekend.
[02:28:12.020 --> 02:28:13.940]   We can, before that we were doing a concert.
[02:28:13.940 --> 02:28:14.780]   So we do, we do a lot of it.
[02:28:14.780 --> 02:28:16.300]   - It's nice, the variety, that's great.
[02:28:16.300 --> 02:28:17.140]   - Yeah, I do.
[02:28:17.140 --> 02:28:18.140]   - That's great.
[02:28:18.140 --> 02:28:20.420]   And meanwhile, let's play a little marble machine
[02:28:20.420 --> 02:28:23.500]   as we head on out.
[02:28:23.500 --> 02:28:24.820]   - Look at this range.
[02:28:24.820 --> 02:28:27.060]   (laughing)
[02:28:27.060 --> 02:28:29.740]   - I'm sorry.
[02:28:29.740 --> 02:28:31.740]   - Is this an X or is this an older?
[02:28:31.740 --> 02:28:33.500]   This is marble machine X.
[02:28:33.500 --> 02:28:35.740]   - That's really, really cool.
[02:28:35.740 --> 02:28:37.300]   - It really is incredible.
[02:28:37.300 --> 02:28:39.460]   I wish I could recommend the whole thing,
[02:28:39.460 --> 02:28:41.300]   but you probably don't have eight weeks
[02:28:41.300 --> 02:28:43.980]   of constant video watching to get through.
[02:28:43.980 --> 02:28:46.940]   I can work on it.
[02:28:46.940 --> 02:28:49.980]   - I need things to do in retirement.
[02:28:49.980 --> 02:28:51.820]   - Once you're up to date with Ted Lasso,
[02:28:51.820 --> 02:28:54.260]   move on to the whole machine X.
[02:28:54.260 --> 02:28:55.540]   - Thanks everybody for joining us.
[02:28:55.540 --> 02:28:56.580]   We do Mac break weekly,
[02:28:56.580 --> 02:28:59.100]   Tuesdays 11 am Pacific, 2 p.m. Eastern time,
[02:28:59.100 --> 02:29:01.340]   1800 UTC, please.
[02:29:01.340 --> 02:29:03.460]   You can watch us live if you want.
[02:29:03.460 --> 02:29:06.260]   Join us at twit.tv/live,
[02:29:06.260 --> 02:29:09.180]   there's live audio and video.
[02:29:09.180 --> 02:29:12.580]   Chatter's who wanna join other people watching live
[02:29:12.580 --> 02:29:14.220]   can join us in two places.
[02:29:14.220 --> 02:29:16.420]   Of course, there's our free IRC.
[02:29:16.420 --> 02:29:17.660]   Been with us for 20 years,
[02:29:17.660 --> 02:29:21.420]   IRC.twit.tv.
[02:29:21.420 --> 02:29:23.300]   Members of Club Twit also have access
[02:29:23.300 --> 02:29:25.820]   to our fabulous Discord server.
[02:29:25.820 --> 02:29:27.540]   That's one of many benefits of Club Twit,
[02:29:27.540 --> 02:29:29.940]   including ad free versions of all the shows,
[02:29:29.940 --> 02:29:32.220]   tracker free versions of all the shows,
[02:29:32.220 --> 02:29:34.340]   plus the Twit Plus feed,
[02:29:34.340 --> 02:29:37.380]   which is stuff that didn't make it to the podcasts.
[02:29:37.380 --> 02:29:39.980]   If you're interested in Club Twit, $7 a month,
[02:29:39.980 --> 02:29:43.180]   it makes a big difference keeping us afloat.
[02:29:43.180 --> 02:29:44.500]   It really helps out.
[02:29:44.500 --> 02:29:45.780]   Maybe that's the best reason to join.
[02:29:45.780 --> 02:29:49.460]   Go to twit.tv/clubtwit.
[02:29:49.460 --> 02:29:51.780]   - After the show on demand versions,
[02:29:51.780 --> 02:29:55.940]   we have trained professionals cutting out all the silence
[02:29:55.940 --> 02:29:59.940]   and no guys, you can't use recut.
[02:29:59.940 --> 02:30:06.300]   They put it up at our website, twit.tv/mbw.
[02:30:06.300 --> 02:30:09.260]   There's a YouTube channel dedicated to Mac break weekly.
[02:30:09.260 --> 02:30:10.940]   You can watch the show there.
[02:30:10.940 --> 02:30:14.020]   Easiest thing to do, probably get a podcast client,
[02:30:14.020 --> 02:30:16.380]   like Apple's podcasts, Google podcasts,
[02:30:16.380 --> 02:30:19.020]   pocket casts, overcasts, something like that.
[02:30:19.020 --> 02:30:20.900]   And subscribe.
[02:30:20.900 --> 02:30:23.340]   That way you'll get the show the minute it's available
[02:30:23.340 --> 02:30:24.900]   of a Tuesday afternoon.
[02:30:24.900 --> 02:30:28.380]   And incidentally, if your podcast client
[02:30:28.380 --> 02:30:30.980]   allows you to leave reviews, be nice
[02:30:30.980 --> 02:30:32.700]   if you left us a five-star review.
[02:30:32.700 --> 02:30:34.460]   I would be eternally grateful.
[02:30:34.460 --> 02:30:35.340]   Thank you.
[02:30:35.340 --> 02:30:38.820]   Tell the world about Mac break weekly.
[02:30:38.820 --> 02:30:40.940]   We've only been doing this for 15 years.
[02:30:40.940 --> 02:30:42.460]   I mean, there's probably people
[02:30:42.460 --> 02:30:44.420]   who never heard of us by now.
[02:30:44.420 --> 02:30:45.940]   Thanks everybody for joining us.
[02:30:45.940 --> 02:30:48.900]   Now it's time to get back to work because
[02:30:48.900 --> 02:30:50.940]   break time is over.
[02:30:50.940 --> 02:30:52.020]   Bye-bye.
[02:30:52.020 --> 02:30:53.340]   - If you find yourself talking
[02:30:53.340 --> 02:30:56.060]   to those virtual assistants in your house quite often,
[02:30:56.060 --> 02:30:58.340]   or maybe you can make your light turn on and off
[02:30:58.340 --> 02:30:59.420]   with the touch of a button,
[02:30:59.420 --> 02:31:02.300]   well Smart Tech Today is the show for you.
[02:31:02.300 --> 02:31:05.060]   Join Matthew Casanelli and myself, Mike Sargent,
[02:31:05.060 --> 02:31:09.140]   every week as we talk all about smart stuff
[02:31:09.140 --> 02:31:11.100]   and the fun that comes along with it.
[02:31:11.100 --> 02:31:13.680]   (upbeat music)
[02:31:13.680 --> 02:31:16.260]   (upbeat music)
[02:31:16.260 --> 02:31:18.840]   (upbeat music)
[02:31:18.840 --> 02:31:21.420]   (upbeat music)
[02:31:21.420 --> 02:31:25.020]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
