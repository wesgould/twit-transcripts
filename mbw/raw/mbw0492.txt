[00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:57.560]   That's why we brought in Jase Snell of six colors.com who made the best graphs.
[00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:59.560]   Oh, that's nice of you to say.
[00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:00.560]   Thank you.
[00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:04.680]   We used them on Twitter and they were fabulous and I gave you credit because that was the
[00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.600]   easiest way to understand what was going on.
[00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:09.200]   Used Chartopia or what?
[00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:10.600]   Oh, I use numbers actually.
[00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:12.000]   It's the only thing I use.
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   I use numbers for is pretty graphs because it makes pretty graphs.
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   Nice.
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.920]   That's Andy Inaco, choraling in the background.
[00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:18.920]   Hello, Andrew.
[00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:19.920]   Hello.
[00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:21.640]   Sometimes you're in a loop.
[00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:25.400]   Your lume cube is making you look fabulous.
[00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:27.680]   Actually I've got the Lume Cube XL.
[00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:32.840]   I've got a brand new like 1200 LED panel over there that I got.
[00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:35.240]   I just bought and I'm working on it.
[00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:36.240]   It's working well enough.
[00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:38.880]   I'm going to buy a second one in a few weeks to put like over there.
[00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:39.880]   Well, you know, you got the key.
[00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:41.080]   You got the filling and you got the hair light.
[00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:42.760]   You got to do all three or you're not.
[00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:46.360]   Got to look, you know, the older you get with these HD cameras, they don't forgive.
[00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:47.520]   Well, as you get older.
[00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:52.120]   Then you get the Dan Rather Eye Light, which is all light.
[00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:54.280]   It's just for the bags.
[00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:57.360]   I don't I'm going to have to get Alex's advice on this one because he recommended of course
[00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:59.040]   the lunch tech 920.
[00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:03.600]   If there's like a like Barbara Streisand style like, you know, Vaseline on the lead.
[00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:05.400]   It is his Barbara brand Vaseline.
[00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:06.400]   Exactly.
[00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:09.160]   And also like only only get me on my left profile.
[00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:11.040]   That's a good profile.
[00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:12.400]   Little Mount Rushmore going on.
[00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:15.080]   Also here Renee Richie, he's back in Montreal.
[00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:17.640]   I am and it's five degrees Celsius here Leo.
[00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:21.080]   So I really hope it's a Batman villain playing with the weather because any other theory
[00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:22.080]   is terrifying.
[00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:26.400]   Yeah, I used to tell the kids a story about a guy in a mountain who controlled the weather.
[00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:29.200]   And I think that's what's going on right now.
[00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:32.120]   Wow, hot, cold, hot, cold.
[00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:33.360]   Five degrees is in horrible.
[00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:35.800]   Well, no, but it's supposed to be minus 30.
[00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:36.800]   Right.
[00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:37.800]   It's just right.
[00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:38.800]   Your igloo might melt.
[00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:42.280]   I think it's like so depressing.
[00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:46.320]   50 59 degrees in Boston yesterday.
[00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:48.080]   What the what?
[00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:51.280]   And I was stuck inside the house, but it was like 50.
[00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:55.480]   That's an alarming temperature, especially given like last year where we didn't have
[00:03:55.480 --> 00:04:00.000]   a day below above freezing for the entire month of February.
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   Yeah.
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:02.560]   Okay.
[00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:07.280]   First of all, there's good news and there's bad news, which you want first.
[00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:08.280]   The good news.
[00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:16.000]   Apple had the most successful quarter in US financial history with profit of more than
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.560]   six billion dollars a month for Q1.
[00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:21.560]   The bad news.
[00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:25.520]   Yesterday, Google became the most valuable company in the world.
[00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:27.240]   So you can't win them all.
[00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:28.240]   Different metrics.
[00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:29.800]   You can win by any metric you choose.
[00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:30.800]   I know.
[00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:34.040]   And Apple for a long time chose to flaunt the fact or at least we did.
[00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:37.120]   I don't know if Apple probably was pretty proud of it too, that they were the most valuable
[00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:40.240]   company according to the stock market.
[00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:44.640]   And there's the irony of this because you can be the have the most profits in the history
[00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:51.080]   of corporate America and still have your stock, you know, the stock market shrug.
[00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:52.840]   And that's because what they said.
[00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:54.080]   That's about growth.
[00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:55.080]   It's over.
[00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:56.080]   It's about growth.
[00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:58.120]   I mean, the stock market Wall Street, they're looking for growth.
[00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:02.280]   They've gotten the narrative for Apple has been huge growth.
[00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:04.560]   And as an investor, you're betting on the future.
[00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:06.920]   You're saying this is some more growth.
[00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:11.120]   And investors are less excited about giant profits.
[00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:13.440]   They want to see growing revenues and profits.
[00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:17.200]   But we don't care because Apple's a strong company making money and their products are
[00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:19.440]   successful, which means they'll continue to invest in them.
[00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:22.960]   But the completion of those two stories is problematic because people here, my mom asked
[00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:24.960]   me that last week, which is his Apple in trouble.
[00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:27.320]   And it's like, no, they had the best quarter ever.
[00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:28.600]   They're going to continue making money.
[00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:31.280]   The smartphone is not going to tail off as a product category.
[00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:34.120]   The iPhone is going to make lots of money for Apple for a long time.
[00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:36.680]   They've got to go to four colors and be a Google site.
[00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:38.440]   Jason, I'm worried about you.
[00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:39.440]   That's right.
[00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:40.440]   Which colors would I lose?
[00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:42.560]   It's very disturbing to even ponder that.
[00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:45.800]   So I mean, that's the difference is if you're an investor, you look at this and say, wow,
[00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:51.560]   Apple is sort of run out of huge growth in the iPhone and their other products.
[00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:55.640]   And if you're a consumer, it kind of doesn't affect you because I think what we're really
[00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:59.240]   seeing here is that everybody's got a smartphone now.
[00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:01.280]   So growth, of course, is going to slow.
[00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:02.840]   And Apple tells stories about it.
[00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:03.840]   But I think in the end, that's--
[00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:04.840]   It's a stable market, basically.
[00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:05.840]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:06.840]   It's not going to double.
[00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:10.640]   There are too many iPhone sales now for it to double every year.
[00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:12.040]   It's just not going to happen anymore.
[00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:14.800]   Well, it's interesting because there's several factors at work.
[00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:19.440]   They had a really big Q2 last year because there were people who upgraded early just
[00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:20.760]   to get a bigger phone.
[00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:22.000]   And also, they couldn't supply enough.
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.800]   So all the sales that didn't get finalized in Q1 got pushed over to Q2 because Apple's
[00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:27.360]   fairly good about reporting.
[00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:30.120]   Sales only actually happened, not just pipeline stuffing things.
[00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:33.520]   So when you do the year-to-year compare, it doesn't look very good because this year,
[00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:34.760]   people had already upgraded to the big phone.
[00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:38.400]   Plus, they had almost limitless availability in the first quarter.
[00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:40.200]   So those people already got their phones.
[00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:43.840]   So because of a confluence of events, and Apple was really good about talking about exchange
[00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:48.000]   rates and all of that, there won't be as many iPhones sold in Q2 this year as it were
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:49.000]   last year.
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:53.520]   And that's a huge doom and gloom statement for Wall Street, even though it doesn't really
[00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:58.000]   represent the total of iPhones sold, just the fact that one quarter this year is not going
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:02.040]   to be a growth quarter for the iPhone, regardless of China is still coming online, regardless
[00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:05.880]   of India is being built up, regardless if you have 60% of people who haven't upgraded
[00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:07.800]   to an iPhone 6 or later.
[00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:11.640]   There's all these other markets and opportunities, but what Wall Street here is its first quarter
[00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:15.000]   of year-to-year contraction, and that is hugely scary for them.
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:20.560]   Although to be fair, that's a bit of a deflection because if they had had unconstrained inventory
[00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:25.720]   last year in that first quarter, then this would be the quarter where they were down
[00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:26.720]   year over year.
[00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:30.640]   So I think it was going to happen regardless, and it just sort of moved around based on
[00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:31.640]   their constraints last year.
[00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:34.160]   Well, eventually everyone on Earth will have an iPhone and then we'll have a huge problem
[00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:35.800]   because selling to Mars is tough.
[00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:36.800]   Limit market.
[00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:40.480]   One of the things, well, everyone have an iPhone, then there'll be more money left for
[00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:42.480]   food and heat and societal collapse.
[00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:43.480]   Well, that's kind of my point.
[00:07:43.480 --> 00:07:44.480]   One of the things that-
[00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:48.400]   We'll trade nine iPhones for a pint of gasoline is what's going to happen.
[00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:51.960]   One of the things that constrains Apple is not so much that they've run out of people,
[00:07:51.960 --> 00:07:53.120]   but they've run out of rich people.
[00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:55.520]   I mean, they're still unwilling to make a low-cost phone.
[00:07:55.520 --> 00:07:58.240]   There's billions more they could sell if they were willing to.
[00:07:58.240 --> 00:07:59.240]   Exactly right.
[00:07:59.240 --> 00:08:01.040]   That's not the market that they're targeting.
[00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:05.400]   In fact, when you listen to Tim Cook talk on their quarterly conference call with analysts,
[00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:09.400]   one of the things he says is there is room for growth for Apple because there's a huge
[00:08:09.400 --> 00:08:14.000]   growing middle class in China and those are their target market.
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:18.480]   In India, they feel it's the same way that they're starting from very little.
[00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:22.640]   They're focusing on people who have more money to spend.
[00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:28.280]   Apple's market share in higher-end devices is very strong and they don't play on the
[00:08:28.280 --> 00:08:29.280]   cheaper device.
[00:08:29.280 --> 00:08:30.280]   They are going for the cheaper device.
[00:08:30.280 --> 00:08:32.880]   They're being a little bit more creative there.
[00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:36.680]   There's some rumors that they're trying to get into India by selling reconditioned older
[00:08:36.680 --> 00:08:42.120]   model phones there because most of the market there doesn't have money for luxury phones,
[00:08:42.120 --> 00:08:45.160]   but they still want the luxury brand.
[00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:48.680]   That's a way for Apple to sort of make an end run around the idea where they don't want
[00:08:48.680 --> 00:08:55.080]   to have to make something like the Moto G, which is a fantastic phone for $190.
[00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:56.920]   It is just a full stop.
[00:08:56.920 --> 00:09:01.720]   It's a fantastic phone, but it's not the sort of phone that Apple culturally might have
[00:09:01.720 --> 00:09:06.240]   a taste for making, but they thought that the iPhone 4S and the iPhone 5 and the iPhone
[00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:10.160]   5S were wonderful phones when they made them new, so they certainly wouldn't lose anything
[00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:15.320]   by being the brokers and trying to be the people who make the money off of those resales
[00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:18.680]   instead of leaving it to Chinese reconditioners.
[00:09:18.680 --> 00:09:21.040]   Your graphs at six colors are great, Jason.
[00:09:21.040 --> 00:09:24.720]   I encourage people to go there because it helps, I think, to see the graphs.
[00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:25.720]   You can kind of understand.
[00:09:25.720 --> 00:09:31.360]   Now, I know most of you are listening, but this graph, which is the four-quarter moving
[00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:36.720]   average, shows that the growth of the iPhone, but also the flattening of the growth as we
[00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:39.880]   get towards the last few quarters.
[00:09:39.880 --> 00:09:44.600]   Apple pointed out 1% growth year over year for the iPhone.
[00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:49.320]   This is probably a better graph than the actual sales graph because it's very peaky.
[00:09:49.320 --> 00:09:54.240]   Yeah, big business is so seasonal in the holiday quarter that it's hard to read what
[00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:56.880]   the trend is because of the spikes.
[00:09:56.880 --> 00:10:00.920]   There was sort of a movement in the last couple of quarters for people who were covering Apple
[00:10:00.920 --> 00:10:04.880]   to try and move to a four-quarter rolling average.
[00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:05.880]   It's a good idea.
[00:10:05.880 --> 00:10:06.880]   It takes out the seasonality of it.
[00:10:06.880 --> 00:10:07.880]   I think you--
[00:10:07.880 --> 00:10:12.560]   So this is quarterly sales for each bar, but it's the average of all four quarters.
[00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:15.640]   It's the last four quarters ending in that quarter.
[00:10:15.640 --> 00:10:16.640]   Right.
[00:10:16.640 --> 00:10:17.640]   Right.
[00:10:17.640 --> 00:10:18.640]   So it just moves it out a little bit.
[00:10:18.640 --> 00:10:24.560]   You can see a couple of really big moments of acceleration for the iPhone and then some
[00:10:24.560 --> 00:10:27.000]   periods of more steady growth.
[00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:28.000]   Right.
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:29.000]   But slow.
[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:32.720]   Of course, the iPhone 6, the big screen.
[00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:37.880]   That was, of course, Q1 2015 one year ago.
[00:10:37.880 --> 00:10:42.920]   And then prior to that, I would guess it was the Q1 2012.
[00:10:42.920 --> 00:10:43.920]   What was that?
[00:10:43.920 --> 00:10:45.920]   The 4, iPhone 4 probably, right?
[00:10:45.920 --> 00:10:46.920]   5.
[00:10:46.920 --> 00:10:47.920]   5?
[00:10:47.920 --> 00:10:48.920]   That's the--
[00:10:48.920 --> 00:10:49.920]   4s was the end of 2011.
[00:10:49.920 --> 00:10:50.920]   Okay.
[00:10:50.920 --> 00:10:51.920]   So it was the iPhone 5.
[00:10:51.920 --> 00:10:52.920]   Interesting.
[00:10:52.920 --> 00:10:54.520]   It shows that people like bigger phones.
[00:10:54.520 --> 00:10:55.520]   Mm-hmm.
[00:10:55.520 --> 00:10:58.960]   Actually, that makes sense because that's the kind of significant change.
[00:10:58.960 --> 00:11:02.320]   It's a change to a phone that would drive people into the market.
[00:11:02.320 --> 00:11:07.040]   Because of course, the problem is that people might use that phone, normal people for years.
[00:11:07.040 --> 00:11:10.360]   So it's the same thing happens in the PC market.
[00:11:10.360 --> 00:11:15.160]   You get a big jump when there's a new version of Microsoft Windows because that's enough
[00:11:15.160 --> 00:11:17.520]   of a change to push people back into the market.
[00:11:17.520 --> 00:11:18.520]   So that kind of makes sense.
[00:11:18.520 --> 00:11:19.520]   Which, the thing--
[00:11:19.520 --> 00:11:24.840]   The reason I mention that is it also means that it may not be that this particular 1%
[00:11:24.840 --> 00:11:30.960]   growth year over year is going to be going on-- I mean, Apple's advisement was, it was
[00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:31.960]   going to continue.
[00:11:31.960 --> 00:11:36.520]   But there could be another big jump if there's another big leap, right?
[00:11:36.520 --> 00:11:39.920]   Especially since the two biggest jumps here are with the new model numbers, right?
[00:11:39.920 --> 00:11:42.040]   With the 5 and the 6 being introduced.
[00:11:42.040 --> 00:11:43.040]   And size.
[00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:44.040]   Yep.
[00:11:44.040 --> 00:11:51.720]   Also, this is sort of a predictable sort of trend for a company like Apple where the first
[00:11:51.720 --> 00:11:56.320]   people in are people like us who are actively excited about technology.
[00:11:56.320 --> 00:12:01.360]   But you're not going to have a great product line based on people who are avid exploiters
[00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:02.360]   of technology.
[00:12:02.360 --> 00:12:06.760]   Really need to get the normal people who just walk into a phone store without any really
[00:12:06.760 --> 00:12:08.760]   preconceived notion of what they want.
[00:12:08.760 --> 00:12:12.440]   And they're determined to walk out with a working phone and they've budgeted 18 minutes
[00:12:12.440 --> 00:12:14.840]   of their day to get a new phone.
[00:12:14.840 --> 00:12:18.960]   And they'll get something based on, hey, they have a nice Hello Kitty case that comes
[00:12:18.960 --> 00:12:19.960]   with this one.
[00:12:19.960 --> 00:12:20.960]   So I'll take that one.
[00:12:20.960 --> 00:12:21.960]   So they have to start making.
[00:12:21.960 --> 00:12:26.320]   So they're shifting away from people who are excited about buying a new phone every
[00:12:26.320 --> 00:12:29.520]   couple of years when their old phone got off contract.
[00:12:29.520 --> 00:12:33.840]   And they're shifting towards people who now buy new phones when they lose their old one,
[00:12:33.840 --> 00:12:37.360]   when not just when they break their old one, but when they're old one gets so broken that
[00:12:37.360 --> 00:12:39.280]   they can't use it anymore.
[00:12:39.280 --> 00:12:42.760]   People are willing to, people who are mainstream users are willing to put up with a lot and
[00:12:42.760 --> 00:12:46.240]   use phones and computers and tablets for years and years and years.
[00:12:46.240 --> 00:12:49.080]   And they kind of have to be forced back into the store.
[00:12:49.080 --> 00:12:53.000]   And so when I see, I've seen graphs like that in other products and it doesn't really scare
[00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:58.520]   me because it just means that now they're succeeding in selling to real people and not
[00:12:58.520 --> 00:13:00.760]   just Apple fans.
[00:13:00.760 --> 00:13:03.920]   And it's almost, it's funny because for years Apple was accused of, you know, making their
[00:13:03.920 --> 00:13:06.440]   products bad over time so that you'd be forced to upgrade.
[00:13:06.440 --> 00:13:09.440]   And it turns out people still like the iPad too is immensely popular.
[00:13:09.440 --> 00:13:11.680]   The iPhone 4S still immensely popular.
[00:13:11.680 --> 00:13:14.360]   People are happy with those devices and not upgrading.
[00:13:14.360 --> 00:13:18.400]   And that sort of creates that tension against the popular narrative for them.
[00:13:18.400 --> 00:13:22.520]   I also think they built them so well that they last and last and last.
[00:13:22.520 --> 00:13:26.960]   I really mean there are times where you're almost frustrated because I want forced touch
[00:13:26.960 --> 00:13:29.280]   and I want the ideas for the Prigman for it, Prancer.
[00:13:29.280 --> 00:13:34.160]   But damn it, the iPhone 4S is still working perfectly and it doesn't even look bad after
[00:13:34.160 --> 00:13:35.760]   three years.
[00:13:35.760 --> 00:13:36.760]   They're a great value.
[00:13:36.760 --> 00:13:40.480]   I think people also misunderstand the, they expect the curve.
[00:13:40.480 --> 00:13:44.480]   Some of the freaking out about the iPhone sales is about the iPod, I think, which, you
[00:13:44.480 --> 00:13:48.360]   know, if you look at that, I did a chart of the iPod units and you know, really hit
[00:13:48.360 --> 00:13:50.360]   the height and then it goes down, right?
[00:13:50.360 --> 00:13:51.360]   Yeah.
[00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:52.360]   It looks like it goes underwater.
[00:13:52.360 --> 00:13:55.880]   I think there's a misunderstanding of the iPhone.
[00:13:55.880 --> 00:13:57.800]   I mean, the smartphone category is different.
[00:13:57.800 --> 00:13:59.920]   It's just different.
[00:13:59.920 --> 00:14:02.840]   And it's not going to trail away to nothing like the iPod.
[00:14:02.840 --> 00:14:06.360]   So, you know, that's something to keep in mind.
[00:14:06.360 --> 00:14:10.200]   There's nothing even on the horizon right now that will replace smartphone as the number
[00:14:10.200 --> 00:14:11.840]   one tech category.
[00:14:11.840 --> 00:14:15.240]   Eventually, somebody will invent something that will stick in our ear or on our eyes
[00:14:15.240 --> 00:14:16.240]   or something.
[00:14:16.240 --> 00:14:19.840]   In our brains, right, Renee, that will surpass it.
[00:14:19.840 --> 00:14:22.200]   But right now, I mean, that is a category unlike any other.
[00:14:22.200 --> 00:14:25.760]   But isn't that after all why Apple's looking at VR and cars?
[00:14:25.760 --> 00:14:28.280]   Well, they're looking for the next big show.
[00:14:28.280 --> 00:14:29.280]   Sure, they say should be.
[00:14:29.280 --> 00:14:30.280]   Right.
[00:14:30.280 --> 00:14:31.280]   It's almost like a distortion field.
[00:14:31.280 --> 00:14:35.800]   Like if you look at iPhone, if you, iPhone is so big, it is such a valuable business.
[00:14:35.800 --> 00:14:40.320]   It is much bigger than, again, oligopoly control of fossil fuel resources that it distorts
[00:14:40.320 --> 00:14:41.480]   everything else about Apple.
[00:14:41.480 --> 00:14:46.120]   If you take iPhone away, Apple still has a good Mac business, a pretty good iPad business,
[00:14:46.120 --> 00:14:47.120]   good accessory business.
[00:14:47.120 --> 00:14:51.480]   And all of those, like great growing services business with App Store and iTunes, all of
[00:14:51.480 --> 00:14:54.000]   those could be hugely successful companies on their own right.
[00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:58.880]   But they themselves are overshadowed by the massive financial draw that is the iPhone.
[00:14:58.880 --> 00:15:01.280]   And it causes as many problems as all of us.
[00:15:01.280 --> 00:15:02.280]   Yeah.
[00:15:02.280 --> 00:15:06.920]   And it's not as though the companies don't have the same sort of, quote, problem, unquote.
[00:15:06.920 --> 00:15:11.360]   Google had their call on Monday and they released their numbers.
[00:15:11.360 --> 00:15:17.760]   And it's pretty, they're pretty much in the same level of success at Apple in that most
[00:15:17.760 --> 00:15:21.200]   of their money comes from their most successful product.
[00:15:21.200 --> 00:15:24.080]   As a matter of fact, when they break down their numbers into everything that now the
[00:15:24.080 --> 00:15:29.440]   Alphabet Corporation does, they actually break it down into like Google products and services
[00:15:29.440 --> 00:15:34.120]   and then something that they actually literally label other bets.
[00:15:34.120 --> 00:15:38.680]   And, and the, and of course the numbers are that all the other bets combined are deeply
[00:15:38.680 --> 00:15:42.440]   in the red to the two and it's something like $430 million.
[00:15:42.440 --> 00:15:48.360]   But the Google services like advertising and other stuff like that is so profitable that
[00:15:48.360 --> 00:15:54.840]   who cares they can Apple is, I'm sure that Apple is interested in the, in the business
[00:15:54.840 --> 00:15:58.040]   potential of cars and VR and stuff like that.
[00:15:58.040 --> 00:16:01.520]   But one of the reasons why they get to do stuff like that is that they have enough firepower
[00:16:01.520 --> 00:16:05.360]   that they can take some gambles and they can just simply investigate things because they're
[00:16:05.360 --> 00:16:08.080]   interesting whether it turns into a real product or not.
[00:16:08.080 --> 00:16:11.720]   So when you hear about stuff like that, you're not hearing about a company that sees that
[00:16:11.720 --> 00:16:17.840]   curve flattening out is what if people stop wanting to use a mobile touchscreen device
[00:16:17.840 --> 00:16:19.440]   that's connected to a cellular network?
[00:16:19.440 --> 00:16:20.760]   What if they stopped using those?
[00:16:20.760 --> 00:16:22.040]   We need to have cars.
[00:16:22.040 --> 00:16:27.120]   It's that if you have 210, 220 billion dollars in cash on hand to say nothing of your other
[00:16:27.120 --> 00:16:32.160]   assets, you may as well start to put out feelers to other technologies that are interesting.
[00:16:32.160 --> 00:16:35.800]   The difference is that Google will show off the stuff they're working on.
[00:16:35.800 --> 00:16:39.240]   Microsoft will show off HoloLens as they're developing it.
[00:16:39.240 --> 00:16:43.920]   Apple is like the Soviet space, the Soviet moonshot program where you know they're spending
[00:16:43.920 --> 00:16:44.920]   millions of dollars on it.
[00:16:44.920 --> 00:16:48.800]   You know the people are dying in the attempt to put Soviets on the moon.
[00:16:48.800 --> 00:16:51.360]   But then we decided that we're not going to pursue this.
[00:16:51.360 --> 00:16:55.440]   So for all the types of purposes, this project never existed.
[00:16:55.440 --> 00:16:57.320]   We never confirmed this.
[00:16:57.320 --> 00:17:01.160]   So this is the, this is the graph you were, I think you were talking about this compares
[00:17:01.160 --> 00:17:02.160]   Apple's unit sales.
[00:17:02.160 --> 00:17:08.520]   By the way, before we even get to that, I just want to say as a, as a Mac guy, let me,
[00:17:08.520 --> 00:17:10.480]   let me, let me look at this.
[00:17:10.480 --> 00:17:12.160]   This is the annual Mac sales.
[00:17:12.160 --> 00:17:13.160]   I am so thrilled.
[00:17:13.160 --> 00:17:14.440]   It's year by year since two.
[00:17:14.440 --> 00:17:20.800]   This is the biggest year ever for Macintosh, 20.6 million units.
[00:17:20.800 --> 00:17:22.280]   Great Mac business.
[00:17:22.280 --> 00:17:26.400]   That's so encouraging because the biggest fear I've always had is with the success of
[00:17:26.400 --> 00:17:30.880]   the iPhone and the removal of the name computers from Apple's name that they might turn their
[00:17:30.880 --> 00:17:31.880]   back on the Mac.
[00:17:31.880 --> 00:17:35.880]   You've always reassured me, no, no, they need to make them.
[00:17:35.880 --> 00:17:38.600]   But that's, this is really good news.
[00:17:38.600 --> 00:17:43.560]   I mean, probably most of this is the 5K iMac, I would guess, but laptops are doing pretty
[00:17:43.560 --> 00:17:44.560]   well too.
[00:17:44.560 --> 00:17:46.760]   Actually two thirds of their Mac sales are laptops.
[00:17:46.760 --> 00:17:47.760]   Or laptops.
[00:17:47.760 --> 00:17:48.760]   Or laptops in general.
[00:17:48.760 --> 00:17:49.760]   All laptops, two thirds.
[00:17:49.760 --> 00:17:50.760]   All right.
[00:17:50.760 --> 00:17:51.800]   But that 5K is a great success.
[00:17:51.800 --> 00:17:53.880]   One teeny, wheny sliver is the Mac Pro.
[00:17:53.880 --> 00:17:54.880]   Yep.
[00:17:54.880 --> 00:17:57.720]   But as I mentioned before the show, it makes it excellent Minecraft server.
[00:17:57.720 --> 00:18:01.960]   Looking for an 8-way 16 gig of RAM.
[00:18:01.960 --> 00:18:04.680]   Also, Minecraft server, your graphics card.
[00:18:04.680 --> 00:18:07.480]   If you're making a pie crust, it'll get that nice and flat.
[00:18:07.480 --> 00:18:09.240]   It rolls it right out.
[00:18:09.240 --> 00:18:12.360]   That extruded aluminum, there's nothing smoother, my friends, nothing.
[00:18:12.360 --> 00:18:14.720]   Yeah, but no, that's really, I'm really glad to see it.
[00:18:14.720 --> 00:18:18.920]   But then let's move on to this graph that you were mentioning, which shows all of Apple's
[00:18:18.920 --> 00:18:20.440]   four big, four product lines.
[00:18:20.440 --> 00:18:24.960]   And when you compare iPhone sales to Mac sales, the Mac really is diminutive.
[00:18:24.960 --> 00:18:28.320]   In fact, it's smaller than the iPad, which is of course having trouble.
[00:18:28.320 --> 00:18:33.840]   What's funny is that, well, it's smaller than the iPad in units, but not in revenue.
[00:18:33.840 --> 00:18:36.040]   Because the iPad's average revenue is much less.
[00:18:36.040 --> 00:18:39.320]   And this is a unit sales because Apple changes their accounting every so often.
[00:18:39.320 --> 00:18:40.320]   And you can't compare revenue.
[00:18:40.320 --> 00:18:41.320]   I like units sales.
[00:18:41.320 --> 00:18:42.320]   You can compare units.
[00:18:42.320 --> 00:18:43.320]   Yeah, I like unit sales.
[00:18:43.320 --> 00:18:49.360]   So one of the things to note here is the iPod, the red line there, is this dome shape.
[00:18:49.360 --> 00:18:50.360]   Let's forget people listening.
[00:18:50.360 --> 00:18:52.320]   Yes, maybe even the upside down.
[00:18:52.320 --> 00:18:55.600]   Yeah, it comes up and then it goes back down.
[00:18:55.600 --> 00:18:58.400]   The Mac just kind of motors along at this one level.
[00:18:58.400 --> 00:19:01.480]   And then with the iPad, what we see is it's kind of like a volcano.
[00:19:01.480 --> 00:19:04.440]   It kind of shoots up and then trails back down.
[00:19:04.440 --> 00:19:07.120]   iPhone, meanwhile, just kind of keeps going up.
[00:19:07.120 --> 00:19:08.120]   Yeah.
[00:19:08.120 --> 00:19:09.120]   Up higher and higher and higher.
[00:19:09.120 --> 00:19:10.560]   And has that sort of plateau.
[00:19:10.560 --> 00:19:15.000]   That's the, it's almost the cartoon graph you see in the New Yorker for a business that's
[00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:18.240]   doing well unless they've turned it on its side in which case.
[00:19:18.240 --> 00:19:19.240]   Yeah.
[00:19:19.240 --> 00:19:21.880]   I mean, it's not quite the proverbial hockey stick, but it's close to that.
[00:19:21.880 --> 00:19:25.520]   But I think the point is actually more like a straight line.
[00:19:25.520 --> 00:19:27.080]   It's not exponential.
[00:19:27.080 --> 00:19:31.160]   It's just nice straight lines to the stars, to the moon.
[00:19:31.160 --> 00:19:33.800]   But there is that little flattening at the end that perturbs people.
[00:19:33.800 --> 00:19:35.640]   And so especially if you want to freak out.
[00:19:35.640 --> 00:19:36.640]   If you want to freak out an iPod.
[00:19:36.640 --> 00:19:37.640]   Right.
[00:19:37.640 --> 00:19:39.760]   So if you want to freak out, you say, "Oh God, it's going to be like the iPod.
[00:19:39.760 --> 00:19:40.760]   It's going to trail off to nothing."
[00:19:40.760 --> 00:19:43.400]   And you know, smartphone category, it's just not like that.
[00:19:43.400 --> 00:19:46.640]   It's going to be, I think they're going to cruise now that they've sort of reached their
[00:19:46.640 --> 00:19:47.640]   cruising altitude.
[00:19:47.640 --> 00:19:49.600]   I suspect that they're going to cruise up there for quite a long time.
[00:19:49.600 --> 00:19:50.600]   What is the life cycle?
[00:19:50.600 --> 00:19:51.600]   Is it two years?
[00:19:51.600 --> 00:19:52.600]   Because of carriers.
[00:19:52.600 --> 00:19:53.600]   We don't.
[00:19:53.600 --> 00:19:56.400]   Everything is changing though because of the iPhone upgrade program and because other
[00:19:56.400 --> 00:19:58.520]   carriers are now offering faster upgrade programs.
[00:19:58.520 --> 00:20:00.080]   Another thing Apple has done, right?
[00:20:00.080 --> 00:20:01.080]   Yeah.
[00:20:01.080 --> 00:20:02.080]   To make just a jumpstart sale.
[00:20:02.080 --> 00:20:04.600]   That's a program that gives you a new phone every year.
[00:20:04.600 --> 00:20:10.040]   So some people may take advantage of not being on a two year contract to go and replace
[00:20:10.040 --> 00:20:11.720]   their phone every three or four years.
[00:20:11.720 --> 00:20:14.320]   Other people are going to do every year.
[00:20:14.320 --> 00:20:17.840]   And I don't know whether, you know, what that ratio is and whether it'll still be on
[00:20:17.840 --> 00:20:20.600]   average two years or where it'll slide a little older or older.
[00:20:20.600 --> 00:20:21.440]   Renee, where's it?
[00:20:21.440 --> 00:20:26.000]   The term for the carriers in Canada for three years?
[00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:27.000]   It was three years.
[00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:28.000]   Yeah.
[00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:29.000]   Usually.
[00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:30.000]   And now it's changing.
[00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:34.480]   Does anybody, has anybody done any research to see if that became the cycle for Canadians
[00:20:34.480 --> 00:20:35.480]   versus two years in the US?
[00:20:35.480 --> 00:20:36.480]   No, yeah.
[00:20:36.480 --> 00:20:37.480]   It did.
[00:20:37.480 --> 00:20:38.480]   Absolutely.
[00:20:38.480 --> 00:20:40.480]   And for most people, because that was also at the peak of the transition period, you
[00:20:40.480 --> 00:20:43.200]   would just go in the end of three years and they would give you whatever the next Nokia
[00:20:43.200 --> 00:20:46.720]   or whatever flat candy bar or phone was free.
[00:20:46.720 --> 00:20:47.720]   And that's all you cared about.
[00:20:47.720 --> 00:20:49.320]   And that's for a lot of people too.
[00:20:49.320 --> 00:20:52.560]   They would come in when their contract expired and they would get whatever was the new free
[00:20:52.560 --> 00:20:53.560]   phone.
[00:20:53.560 --> 00:20:55.960]   And hey, this one happens to an Android and uses Facebook, but they don't really care.
[00:20:55.960 --> 00:20:59.640]   It's just the next free phone and the carrier has their own incentives to push whatever
[00:20:59.640 --> 00:21:01.880]   phone is giving them the best deal at that point in time.
[00:21:01.880 --> 00:21:06.280]   So it was a very distorted market and Apple happened to do really well because of brands.
[00:21:06.280 --> 00:21:11.040]   But the ironic thing is that when Apple was doing super well, the narrative was, oh, Apple's
[00:21:11.040 --> 00:21:12.520]   doing well, but it can never last.
[00:21:12.520 --> 00:21:13.520]   Next quarter is going to go down.
[00:21:13.520 --> 00:21:14.520]   Oh, they did well again.
[00:21:14.520 --> 00:21:16.960]   That just makes it even more likely that they're going to do terribly next year.
[00:21:16.960 --> 00:21:18.360]   Oh, they did well three years in a row.
[00:21:18.360 --> 00:21:19.880]   The fourth year has got a tank.
[00:21:19.880 --> 00:21:23.720]   And then finally, they get to the point where there's almost no more money to take out of
[00:21:23.720 --> 00:21:24.720]   this stuff.
[00:21:24.720 --> 00:21:26.800]   And it's like, oh, we knew it all the time.
[00:21:26.800 --> 00:21:29.440]   Just all the years have lost opportunity, Leo.
[00:21:29.440 --> 00:21:34.120]   But look how many businesses are in there that are in that red bar at the bottom here.
[00:21:34.120 --> 00:21:35.600]   That's negative growth.
[00:21:35.600 --> 00:21:37.680]   iPod negative growth.
[00:21:37.680 --> 00:21:39.920]   Mac is just dipping into negative growth.
[00:21:39.920 --> 00:21:41.440]   And keeping in mind, that's year over year.
[00:21:41.440 --> 00:21:45.320]   So what you're showing there is not sales going down, but growth going down.
[00:21:45.320 --> 00:21:47.960]   And this is the world view.
[00:21:47.960 --> 00:21:50.040]   For those who are listening, you can't see it.
[00:21:50.040 --> 00:21:51.040]   It's just a whole bunch of things.
[00:21:51.040 --> 00:21:54.120]   There's a whole bunch of things going down because the way Wall Street views the world
[00:21:54.120 --> 00:21:57.240]   is this, which is how much growth are you showing me?
[00:21:57.240 --> 00:22:01.120]   And on this chart, the iPhone does not go shooting upward.
[00:22:01.120 --> 00:22:05.480]   It kind of bounces around and is basically slowly gliding down to zero.
[00:22:05.480 --> 00:22:08.040]   Wall Street never encouraged Apple when they had explosive growth.
[00:22:08.040 --> 00:22:09.040]   They just didn't believe it.
[00:22:09.040 --> 00:22:10.040]   It wasn't like Amazon or fake.
[00:22:10.040 --> 00:22:12.240]   There's going to be huge growth.
[00:22:12.240 --> 00:22:14.160]   It was every year, even though there was a potential.
[00:22:14.160 --> 00:22:17.920]   If you look at that stick again for the iPhone, that was never factored in or actually
[00:22:17.920 --> 00:22:18.920]   respected by Wall Street.
[00:22:18.920 --> 00:22:19.920]   Yeah.
[00:22:19.920 --> 00:22:20.920]   These are...
[00:22:20.920 --> 00:22:22.760]   Remember, of course, they're looking at different...
[00:22:22.760 --> 00:22:27.400]   They have different expectations and they're looking for different results than we are.
[00:22:27.400 --> 00:22:32.040]   We're not looking for a successful company that will continue to innovate and continue
[00:22:32.040 --> 00:22:37.160]   to create great new products and continue to support our good old products.
[00:22:37.160 --> 00:22:42.280]   They, of course, that's like talking about music to a fish because they're just interested
[00:22:42.280 --> 00:22:45.120]   in if I put my money here, what's that money going to do?
[00:22:45.120 --> 00:22:46.800]   That is their only concern.
[00:22:46.800 --> 00:22:52.120]   That's why we shouldn't give them too much flack for not seeing the bigger picture because
[00:22:52.120 --> 00:22:54.800]   they do see the bigger pictures, just their own picture.
[00:22:54.800 --> 00:22:59.560]   But going back just for a second to the iPod, I do see a lot of people who are looking at
[00:22:59.560 --> 00:23:02.920]   charts like that and say, "Oh, well, see, it's just what happened to the iPod."
[00:23:02.920 --> 00:23:05.080]   Sometimes analysts even talk about that too.
[00:23:05.080 --> 00:23:09.120]   But as part of that conversation, you have to keep in mind that Apple sabotaged the
[00:23:09.120 --> 00:23:10.320]   iPod themselves.
[00:23:10.320 --> 00:23:12.200]   They realized that there's not...
[00:23:12.200 --> 00:23:14.880]   They didn't believe there was going to be a big future for these players.
[00:23:14.880 --> 00:23:20.120]   They quite distinctly started moving all the features onto a phone to try to sell you
[00:23:20.120 --> 00:23:23.000]   a really expensive phone instead of an inexpensive player.
[00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:28.560]   Not only that, but they also failed to upgrade the iPods in any meaningful way.
[00:23:28.560 --> 00:23:32.920]   You have people who are iPod fans who don't have any new product to buy, even if they
[00:23:32.920 --> 00:23:34.440]   are big fans.
[00:23:34.440 --> 00:23:37.400]   People who aren't specifically fans of the iPod are going to look at their phones and
[00:23:37.400 --> 00:23:41.320]   say, "Well, why am I bothering to carry this other one with you?"
[00:23:41.320 --> 00:23:42.760]   Yes, it is a bump.
[00:23:42.760 --> 00:23:44.760]   Yes, it does go up and then down again.
[00:23:44.760 --> 00:23:46.640]   That's not a good example again.
[00:23:46.640 --> 00:23:48.580]   You're not worried about...
[00:23:48.580 --> 00:23:53.600]   Other companies will sabotage their own products unintentionally, and that is a concern, but
[00:23:53.600 --> 00:23:56.960]   Apple does sometimes that intentionally, and that's not a problem.
[00:23:56.960 --> 00:24:00.040]   That's why Apple is spending a lot of their cash.
[00:24:00.040 --> 00:24:04.680]   Like Leo was saying about on a car or VR or things that we haven't had reported in the
[00:24:04.680 --> 00:24:07.360]   Wall Street Journal yet.
[00:24:07.360 --> 00:24:08.360]   They should, right?
[00:24:08.360 --> 00:24:13.400]   Because their goal is always to be the company that builds the replacement for their thing.
[00:24:13.400 --> 00:24:17.760]   Apple wants to be the leader in creating the replacement for the smartphone market, and
[00:24:17.760 --> 00:24:19.760]   that may not happen for 10 or 20 years.
[00:24:19.760 --> 00:24:23.680]   But if you're Apple, you want to do that because Apple has benefited from being the
[00:24:23.680 --> 00:24:27.480]   leader in creating that smartphone market that we think of now.
[00:24:27.480 --> 00:24:30.920]   They've really started the flood with the iPhone, and they've benefited greatly with
[00:24:30.920 --> 00:24:32.520]   it.
[00:24:32.520 --> 00:24:37.440]   What you don't want to have is have that dominant product and someone else replaces it.
[00:24:37.440 --> 00:24:41.520]   That's why they're spending all that cash on all these products that we will not even
[00:24:41.520 --> 00:24:44.800]   see if they even turn into products for five or ten years.
[00:24:44.800 --> 00:24:52.240]   We're going to talk about that, and according to the Germanator, we have a date in March.
[00:24:52.240 --> 00:24:55.040]   The Germanator says, but we'll talk about that in just a second.
[00:24:55.040 --> 00:24:58.640]   Actually, this is a good time to talk about gazelle.com.
[00:24:58.640 --> 00:25:04.800]   Our sponsor, gazelle, is the place to go with your old iPhone, so you can get a new iPhone.
[00:25:04.800 --> 00:25:07.320]   You don't want to just throw your old stuff in the drawer.
[00:25:07.320 --> 00:25:11.760]   I'm sure you could give it to Aunt Bertha, but she's really going to appreciate that.
[00:25:11.760 --> 00:25:17.480]   Wouldn't you like to have a couple of hundos in your pocket instead for Aunt Bertha?
[00:25:17.480 --> 00:25:20.880]   Go to gazelle.com, the place to sell your used electronics.
[00:25:20.880 --> 00:25:21.880]   Here's the deal.
[00:25:21.880 --> 00:25:25.400]   You can get a quote now and lock it in for 30 days.
[00:25:25.400 --> 00:25:29.200]   You don't have to commit the only commitments on their part.
[00:25:29.200 --> 00:25:30.200]   They're promising.
[00:25:30.200 --> 00:25:36.000]   They will give you that price any time in the next 30 days on a smartphone, a tablet
[00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:40.160]   from a lot of manufacturers, not just the iPad, but the Samsung tablets, the Google
[00:25:40.160 --> 00:25:43.560]   tablets, even Microsoft Surface tablets.
[00:25:43.560 --> 00:25:45.760]   They'll also buy computers and monitors.
[00:25:45.760 --> 00:25:47.520]   Go to gazelle.com.
[00:25:47.520 --> 00:25:50.560]   Get a quote on your device.
[00:25:50.560 --> 00:25:51.920]   Put that in your back pocket.
[00:25:51.920 --> 00:25:54.720]   You don't have to take advantage of it because you've got 30 days to decide.
[00:25:54.720 --> 00:25:56.640]   Once you do, of course, they'll send you a box.
[00:25:56.640 --> 00:25:58.320]   All the shipping is paid.
[00:25:58.320 --> 00:26:00.800]   It's very easy.
[00:26:00.800 --> 00:26:05.960]   They turn it around fast with a check or a PayPal credit or get a bump by 5% with
[00:26:05.960 --> 00:26:07.680]   an Amazon gift card.
[00:26:07.680 --> 00:26:09.320]   That's a nice deal too.
[00:26:09.320 --> 00:26:11.560]   G-A-Z-E-L-L-E.com.
[00:26:11.560 --> 00:26:15.640]   You might wonder, what do they do with those devices?
[00:26:15.640 --> 00:26:20.080]   Well, the very best devices they will sell at gazelle.
[00:26:20.080 --> 00:26:23.920]   So you can buy certified pre-owned devices as well.
[00:26:23.920 --> 00:26:25.680]   Find your device.
[00:26:25.680 --> 00:26:27.440]   They sell iPhones.
[00:26:27.440 --> 00:26:33.040]   And you get a choice of 4S, 5, 5S, 6, 6+, plus.
[00:26:33.040 --> 00:26:37.200]   You can also choose from a standard Air or Mini iPad.
[00:26:37.200 --> 00:26:39.240]   And the price is right.
[00:26:39.240 --> 00:26:43.160]   You don't have to worry either because they go all everything they sell goes through.
[00:26:43.160 --> 00:26:44.960]   They're rigorous 30-point inspection to make sure.
[00:26:44.960 --> 00:26:49.960]   Not only they're fully functional, but they're no major defects like scratches on the screen,
[00:26:49.960 --> 00:26:50.960]   things like that.
[00:26:50.960 --> 00:26:53.200]   And you can choose if you want to save more.
[00:26:53.200 --> 00:26:54.200]   You can.
[00:26:54.200 --> 00:27:00.640]   You can choose a little bit more gently worn versus like new.
[00:27:00.640 --> 00:27:02.360]   It's a great value on pre-owned devices.
[00:27:02.360 --> 00:27:05.320]   And a lot of people prefer those, especially for the kids.
[00:27:05.320 --> 00:27:08.760]   Or if you've lost the phone once or twice or broken it once or twice.
[00:27:08.760 --> 00:27:11.800]   Maybe you don't want to buy a brand new one just yet, especially with a new one on the
[00:27:11.800 --> 00:27:13.600]   way.
[00:27:13.600 --> 00:27:16.360]   We know the seven will be out this fall and maybe some will be out this spring.
[00:27:16.360 --> 00:27:22.000]   So go to gazelle.com right now to buy or to sell G-A-Z-E-L-L-E.
[00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:24.200]   All the devices work with all the major carriers in the US.
[00:27:24.200 --> 00:27:27.080]   But never, ever do you have a carrier contract.
[00:27:27.080 --> 00:27:31.360]   And of course, you always have a 30-day return guarantee.
[00:27:31.360 --> 00:27:35.760]   Gazelle.com, we love him.
[00:27:35.760 --> 00:27:40.080]   Mark Gurman, I call him the Girmeneta because he's so good on these rumors.
[00:27:40.080 --> 00:27:44.640]   Six hours ago, a nine to five Mac declared a date.
[00:27:44.640 --> 00:27:48.760]   John Patchkowski almost instantly declared it was true on Buzzfeed.
[00:27:48.760 --> 00:27:50.880]   From John says he got it from good sources.
[00:27:50.880 --> 00:27:53.040]   Presumably Mark Gurman, but I don't know.
[00:27:53.040 --> 00:27:56.040]   Maybe they share sources in Apple.
[00:27:56.040 --> 00:27:59.560]   March 15th, the Ides of March.
[00:27:59.560 --> 00:28:00.560]   Yep.
[00:28:00.560 --> 00:28:02.000]   You guys concur.
[00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:03.960]   You have your own sources.
[00:28:03.960 --> 00:28:04.960]   Yep.
[00:28:04.960 --> 00:28:05.960]   All right.
[00:28:05.960 --> 00:28:07.760]   We will set us.
[00:28:07.760 --> 00:28:09.960]   Not as good as Mark's.
[00:28:09.960 --> 00:28:12.200]   But yep, I would say so.
[00:28:12.200 --> 00:28:13.200]   Yep.
[00:28:13.200 --> 00:28:18.760]   So do you also hear as we have over and over again, there will be a four-inch iPhone 5
[00:28:18.760 --> 00:28:20.960]   SE based possibly on the A9?
[00:28:20.960 --> 00:28:27.680]   Yeah, it'll be 5 SE, A9, probably the new eyesight camera for the generation.
[00:28:27.680 --> 00:28:30.080]   I don't think I haven't heard anything about four-inch.
[00:28:30.080 --> 00:28:31.960]   Sorry, 3D touch, which is it?
[00:28:31.960 --> 00:28:32.960]   3D touch.
[00:28:32.960 --> 00:28:35.640]   Yeah, 3D touch on the iPhones.
[00:28:35.640 --> 00:28:39.400]   But it should enjoy, like, again, it's a chipset replacement.
[00:28:39.400 --> 00:28:43.120]   It's not a 6C, it's not a 6S-C or a 6S-E.
[00:28:43.120 --> 00:28:45.360]   It's a 5S, so it's the 5S platform.
[00:28:45.360 --> 00:28:48.240]   If you were to look at them face to face, they would likely be identical.
[00:28:48.240 --> 00:28:51.480]   You would have a hard time telling them apart just by staring straight at them.
[00:28:51.480 --> 00:28:54.080]   But if you take the guts out and you put all the modern guts inside it.
[00:28:54.080 --> 00:28:55.080]   It's kind of interesting.
[00:28:55.080 --> 00:28:56.080]   It's kind of interesting.
[00:28:56.080 --> 00:28:59.000]   It's like having an image forward with a modern engine.
[00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:02.000]   Well, not just that, but I like this idea a lot.
[00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:06.680]   Kind of like how I was confused by a friend of mine who has a BMW M3.
[00:29:06.680 --> 00:29:09.880]   And because of software and phones, I was like, oh, so the next year's model is the
[00:29:09.880 --> 00:29:11.880]   M4, then there's the M5.
[00:29:11.880 --> 00:29:15.720]   And no, there's just this thing called the M3 that they keep updating year after year.
[00:29:15.720 --> 00:29:18.960]   And people who are shopping for an M3 know what an M3 is.
[00:29:18.960 --> 00:29:23.560]   And so this might shed, it made me change some of my thinking on this rumor of an iPhone
[00:29:23.560 --> 00:29:25.560]   7 that doesn't have a phone jack.
[00:29:25.560 --> 00:29:29.520]   But if they were to simply add an iPhone 7 to the line and just keep saying, here's
[00:29:29.520 --> 00:29:31.200]   what the iPhone 6 does.
[00:29:31.200 --> 00:29:33.600]   Here is what the iPhone 5 does.
[00:29:33.600 --> 00:29:39.480]   And they could, at least for a couple of years, keep improving it with, as I like the terminology
[00:29:39.480 --> 00:29:44.640]   that Renee used, that basically it's an iPhone 5 frame, but it means they can change the
[00:29:44.640 --> 00:29:47.840]   engine around, they can change the screen around, they can change other things around.
[00:29:47.840 --> 00:29:50.840]   So basically they maintain the price points where they are.
[00:29:50.840 --> 00:29:55.440]   People will always know that the iPhone 6 is their mainstream powerful phone.
[00:29:55.440 --> 00:29:56.440]   It's slightly larger.
[00:29:56.440 --> 00:30:00.840]   They know that the iPhone 5 is always going to be their compact one that is not quite so
[00:30:00.840 --> 00:30:05.880]   powerful, but it will still support all the features that you hear about in the Apple
[00:30:05.880 --> 00:30:06.880]   ads.
[00:30:06.880 --> 00:30:11.720]   And then the iPhone 7 is the one for people like us who might be a couple of years ahead
[00:30:11.720 --> 00:30:16.400]   of other people who aren't going to start writing a 1200 word angry think piece when
[00:30:16.400 --> 00:30:20.440]   I had the idea of a phone that doesn't have an analog headphone jack.
[00:30:20.440 --> 00:30:24.560]   If this is just speculation, I like that thinking of my part, but I love this.
[00:30:24.560 --> 00:30:25.920]   If that's where they're going, I love that idea.
[00:30:25.920 --> 00:30:28.680]   It's the kind of thing that mature industry does, right?
[00:30:28.680 --> 00:30:31.960]   The way that I understood it is it was almost the same as what happened with the iPod touch
[00:30:31.960 --> 00:30:35.120]   last year where they took the existing iPod touch and they brought it up to date in terms
[00:30:35.120 --> 00:30:37.440]   of the processor and the specs.
[00:30:37.440 --> 00:30:40.680]   And that's because there are people who love the 4 inch iPhones, people who love the iPhone
[00:30:40.680 --> 00:30:44.760]   5S and they want to make those people's experience the best they possibly can.
[00:30:44.760 --> 00:30:48.720]   So right now, if you want to get a 4 inch iPhone, you get an iPhone 5S from 2012 and
[00:30:48.720 --> 00:30:50.840]   it's yeah, or 2013.
[00:30:50.840 --> 00:30:55.120]   It's yeah, but it's not a modern iPhone and those people 60% of people still have an
[00:30:55.120 --> 00:30:59.240]   upgrade to an iPhone 6 or higher and some of those are because they want a smaller phone,
[00:30:59.240 --> 00:31:02.480]   some is because they want the $100 cheaper price point phone.
[00:31:02.480 --> 00:31:05.840]   This gives all those people what they want and they get a much better experience and
[00:31:05.840 --> 00:31:09.520]   they can sort of carry forward all the new technologies and operating systems that Apple's
[00:31:09.520 --> 00:31:12.640]   going to introduce this year next year, the year after.
[00:31:12.640 --> 00:31:17.600]   So I do like that idea, the idea that you know, you have a kind of a, isn't the word
[00:31:17.600 --> 00:31:22.600]   orthogonal, I don't know what that means, but I'm adding a stressful market.
[00:31:22.600 --> 00:31:24.520]   Apple's not afraid to spread their product line out.
[00:31:24.520 --> 00:31:26.720]   I think that's, I think that's good to use these old models.
[00:31:26.720 --> 00:31:29.160]   You have reasonable price points.
[00:31:29.160 --> 00:31:31.360]   And people ask Apple, why don't they make a cheap product?
[00:31:31.360 --> 00:31:34.320]   And the answer is, well, instead of making a cheap product, we make a great product and
[00:31:34.320 --> 00:31:36.160]   then over time it becomes less expensive.
[00:31:36.160 --> 00:31:37.080]   You know, how he does that?
[00:31:37.080 --> 00:31:42.920]   They have an A3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and you, and it's a very, you know, it's a smooth price
[00:31:42.920 --> 00:31:43.920]   scale.
[00:31:43.920 --> 00:31:46.600]   But this was the question is with the 5S, would they just let it sort of sit there and
[00:31:46.600 --> 00:31:49.360]   rot or would they say, well, okay, do the right thing?
[00:31:49.360 --> 00:31:51.720]   We need to, we need to bump this a little bit.
[00:31:51.720 --> 00:31:52.720]   And that's just super smart.
[00:31:52.720 --> 00:31:54.080]   Because the people who want that phone.
[00:31:54.080 --> 00:31:55.760]   Slow mo on the chair made a good point.
[00:31:55.760 --> 00:32:00.000]   It's another, it's another indication that we really need to just make a list of all
[00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:06.200]   those tropes that we all always thought that was true of Apple as of like 2007, 2008,
[00:32:06.200 --> 00:32:07.720]   2009 and throw up that book.
[00:32:07.720 --> 00:32:10.840]   Because one of those tropes was that Apple likes to have a really lean product line.
[00:32:10.840 --> 00:32:14.240]   They like to have good, better, best and they're not going to complicate things by adding
[00:32:14.240 --> 00:32:15.320]   more models to it.
[00:32:15.320 --> 00:32:17.040]   But it is now 2016.
[00:32:17.040 --> 00:32:20.720]   And if, again, if they're people who want to, who are willing to spend money for a four
[00:32:20.720 --> 00:32:24.360]   inch phone, Apple has no problem with taking that person's money and giving them a really
[00:32:24.360 --> 00:32:25.440]   good product while they're at it.
[00:32:25.440 --> 00:32:29.280]   Where does this, as I said, put the seven, you've got good, better, best, bestest.
[00:32:29.280 --> 00:32:31.760]   What, uh, forget, good, better, best, forget it.
[00:32:31.760 --> 00:32:32.760]   Okay, four lines.
[00:32:32.760 --> 00:32:33.760]   I'm serious.
[00:32:33.760 --> 00:32:36.280]   But where, and I'm serious, you're, where does the seven fit in that?
[00:32:36.280 --> 00:32:38.680]   So the way it fits is you'll always have the new flagship phone.
[00:32:38.680 --> 00:32:40.720]   So the seven's going to be the new flagship phone.
[00:32:40.720 --> 00:32:43.240]   Then you have last year's phone that stays over at the middle point.
[00:32:43.240 --> 00:32:46.160]   And that's for people who they really want an iPhone, but they don't think all the extra
[00:32:46.160 --> 00:32:47.560]   features are worth an extra hundred bucks.
[00:32:47.560 --> 00:32:49.360]   So they'll, they'll take the discount.
[00:32:49.360 --> 00:32:51.000]   Then you have a phone underneath that.
[00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:52.880]   And this year that would have been the iPhone six.
[00:32:52.880 --> 00:32:56.000]   You get the iPhone seven, six S and then iPhone six.
[00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:59.880]   But there's not a lot of differentiation between the iPhone six and the iPhone six S plus.
[00:32:59.880 --> 00:33:02.880]   It doesn't help people who want a smaller iPhone.
[00:33:02.880 --> 00:33:06.320]   It doesn't help Apple who wants to keep ASP centered around the middle sort of middle
[00:33:06.320 --> 00:33:07.720]   of the road iPhone.
[00:33:07.720 --> 00:33:10.720]   So by doing this, they get to still have the new flagship iPhone.
[00:33:10.720 --> 00:33:13.800]   They get the iPhone six S line right at the middle point, which is still a really good
[00:33:13.800 --> 00:33:14.800]   phone.
[00:33:14.800 --> 00:33:18.000]   Then they have a highly differentiated iPhone that also allows in people who want the smaller
[00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:19.000]   screen size.
[00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:21.680]   So sort of win, win, win for everybody this year.
[00:33:21.680 --> 00:33:26.680]   And of course it fits in with, it also fits in with remember the, the 2015 MacBook, which
[00:33:26.680 --> 00:33:30.760]   was totally impractical for the mainstream, but there are a lot of people that really
[00:33:30.760 --> 00:33:32.640]   wanted a machine exactly like that.
[00:33:32.640 --> 00:33:37.120]   So maybe again, if we were, if we're accepting that this is, this idea is true, you could
[00:33:37.120 --> 00:33:41.240]   have, they would have the freedom to make an iPhone seven that is not necessarily practical
[00:33:41.240 --> 00:33:46.720]   for everybody, but is the first tee off for a lot of ideas that are going to be mainstream
[00:33:46.720 --> 00:33:48.920]   across the product line in a couple of years time.
[00:33:48.920 --> 00:33:53.720]   I mean, we're also hearing rumors about how they might be working on a radically new camera
[00:33:53.720 --> 00:33:58.720]   system that's built based on multiple lenses and will be the biggest bump up again.
[00:33:58.720 --> 00:34:04.680]   There's a rumor that is going to be not just an incremental bump up, but, but just the biggest,
[00:34:04.680 --> 00:34:07.920]   one of the biggest bumps they've ever done that might not be something that everyone
[00:34:07.920 --> 00:34:11.680]   is willing to pay for that might not be something that people would be willing to trade off a
[00:34:11.680 --> 00:34:15.720]   little bit of battery life for, but they could put that in the iPhone seven because they're
[00:34:15.720 --> 00:34:19.720]   attracting people who are deaf who are going to look at that and say, I really do want,
[00:34:19.720 --> 00:34:25.520]   I really do want those features, even if it's, I'm, I'm mutant who, who isn't in the mainstream
[00:34:25.520 --> 00:34:26.520]   yet.
[00:34:26.520 --> 00:34:31.400]   And of course, as slow mo in the chat room said, part of this would be make sure Apple pay
[00:34:31.400 --> 00:34:33.680]   works on all four platforms, right?
[00:34:33.680 --> 00:34:34.680]   Yeah, there's, there's the thing.
[00:34:34.680 --> 00:34:40.760]   I mean, there's also this rumor about a new iPad, iPad Air three, right?
[00:34:40.760 --> 00:34:41.760]   And it's the same thing.
[00:34:41.760 --> 00:34:45.440]   It's sort of like after a while, you need to take the base features of your product line
[00:34:45.440 --> 00:34:51.160]   and stretch them across the line and the not having Apple pay on that, on the five S is
[00:34:51.160 --> 00:34:52.160]   a problem.
[00:34:52.160 --> 00:34:55.120]   And so if you do a five SE and you add Apple pay, that makes sense.
[00:34:55.120 --> 00:34:58.960]   Like on the iPads, eventually every iPad's going to need Apple pencil support and the
[00:34:58.960 --> 00:35:00.960]   smart connector and all those sorts of things.
[00:35:00.960 --> 00:35:05.040]   They're kind of part of the, they're part of the story of the platform and, and not being
[00:35:05.040 --> 00:35:07.760]   able to do Apple pay on the, on the five S is a problem.
[00:35:07.760 --> 00:35:08.760]   Yeah.
[00:35:08.760 --> 00:35:13.400]   And the seven, so there will, do you think four will stop at four?
[00:35:13.400 --> 00:35:16.160]   Is that a seem reasonable?
[00:35:16.160 --> 00:35:19.680]   Or we have like, like Audi does like seven different.
[00:35:19.680 --> 00:35:21.480]   Well, I mean, I don't know.
[00:35:21.480 --> 00:35:22.480]   I mean, I don't know.
[00:35:22.480 --> 00:35:25.360]   So the plus, the plus and the regular are just two things are going to have now.
[00:35:25.360 --> 00:35:28.160]   So there's a six, a six S and a six S plus.
[00:35:28.160 --> 00:35:31.200]   They'll be replaced by this seven and seven plus.
[00:35:31.200 --> 00:35:33.760]   Yeah, because again, you want to add addressable markets.
[00:35:33.760 --> 00:35:38.320]   Anytime you have a huge amount of market share, having one product to serve the entire breadth
[00:35:38.320 --> 00:35:41.480]   of that market is really hard because people have different needs and people who want to
[00:35:41.480 --> 00:35:45.360]   just have an iPhone and almost run their business off an iPhone, they really value the
[00:35:45.360 --> 00:35:46.360]   plus.
[00:35:46.360 --> 00:35:49.920]   So even if that's, you know, out of a hundred million people, if that's 10, 20, 30 million
[00:35:49.920 --> 00:35:50.920]   people, that's a lot.
[00:35:50.920 --> 00:35:53.960]   If you have the smaller iPhone, people want to put it in their clutches, their pockets,
[00:35:53.960 --> 00:35:56.720]   they want something small, their finger can get across.
[00:35:56.720 --> 00:35:58.880]   One of those 10 or 20 million people, that's a lot.
[00:35:58.880 --> 00:36:01.520]   And so you have to start adding those addressable markets.
[00:36:01.520 --> 00:36:07.880]   Apple's job is to have the fewest phones possible that cover the greatest market possible.
[00:36:07.880 --> 00:36:12.640]   And it seems like they're doing that with the four inch phone, the 4.7 and the 5.5.
[00:36:12.640 --> 00:36:14.520]   So okay.
[00:36:14.520 --> 00:36:16.040]   So we'll have a five S.
[00:36:16.040 --> 00:36:17.040]   Oh, okay.
[00:36:17.040 --> 00:36:20.480]   Why don't I mention when the seven comes out, the six will go away.
[00:36:20.480 --> 00:36:21.480]   Right.
[00:36:21.480 --> 00:36:22.480]   And we'll still have the six S and six S.
[00:36:22.480 --> 00:36:25.640]   So there will be kind of small, medium, large or something like that.
[00:36:25.640 --> 00:36:27.440]   But I don't, I really don't know.
[00:36:27.440 --> 00:36:31.600]   I'm still wrestling with the idea of if it's true that they're the iPhone seven will not
[00:36:31.600 --> 00:36:33.800]   have an analog audio port.
[00:36:33.800 --> 00:36:34.800]   I see.
[00:36:34.800 --> 00:36:36.440]   That just seems, that just seems stupid.
[00:36:36.440 --> 00:36:37.440]   I'll see.
[00:36:37.440 --> 00:36:39.160]   I'm saying that just seems stupid.
[00:36:39.160 --> 00:36:40.160]   I agree.
[00:36:40.160 --> 00:36:41.160]   I can't make a type C.
[00:36:41.160 --> 00:36:48.200]   What I'm saying is that it makes, it makes more sense if it's more of a 2015 MacBook
[00:36:48.200 --> 00:36:51.440]   sort of situation that says that there are going to be people who are going to like everything
[00:36:51.440 --> 00:36:54.800]   we do with the iPhone seven, but we're not going to abandon the people who like their
[00:36:54.800 --> 00:36:56.600]   iPhone six plus.
[00:36:56.600 --> 00:37:00.080]   They just, that success plus, they just wish it were a little bit faster or just a little
[00:37:00.080 --> 00:37:01.240]   bit more like that.
[00:37:01.240 --> 00:37:05.400]   You do that at your peril, but it is nice to have one model like the MacBook where we're
[00:37:05.400 --> 00:37:06.400]   going to try stuff.
[00:37:06.400 --> 00:37:08.160]   We're going to push, push the envelope with this.
[00:37:08.160 --> 00:37:11.840]   And it doesn't need to be mainstream or the next big thing.
[00:37:11.840 --> 00:37:14.240]   I think you could say the Mac Pro is that way too.
[00:37:14.240 --> 00:37:16.640]   But we're going to, but this is a platform we could try stuff.
[00:37:16.640 --> 00:37:17.640]   Right.
[00:37:17.640 --> 00:37:20.960]   So how do you innovate on the iPhone when it, when it is your entire company?
[00:37:20.960 --> 00:37:24.160]   And I think the answer may be you, you sell other iPhones too.
[00:37:24.160 --> 00:37:25.160]   Right.
[00:37:25.160 --> 00:37:26.160]   Yep.
[00:37:26.160 --> 00:37:27.160]   All right.
[00:37:27.160 --> 00:37:32.000]   We also think, yes, new, they didn't do a new air last September.
[00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:36.080]   So we're due, we got a new mini, we got the mini four, air three would be this.
[00:37:36.080 --> 00:37:40.340]   I heard from a lot of people when we were trying to analyze the iPad sales continuing
[00:37:40.340 --> 00:37:44.000]   to drop that I heard from a lot of people who said, you know, I'm actually kind of ready
[00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:47.880]   to buy a new iPad, but I wanted the air three and I'm going to wait for it.
[00:37:47.880 --> 00:37:54.440]   And they did not, I mean, to be, to be completely honest, Apple failed to update the most popular
[00:37:54.440 --> 00:37:55.920]   iPad this fall.
[00:37:55.920 --> 00:37:56.920]   Right.
[00:37:56.920 --> 00:37:58.560]   So are we surprised that sales didn't really jump?
[00:37:58.560 --> 00:38:02.800]   It's so, so this is that story, which is if the rumors are true and they're from a good
[00:38:02.800 --> 00:38:06.880]   source, you add support for the, for the smart connector, you add support for the Apple
[00:38:06.880 --> 00:38:07.880]   pencil.
[00:38:07.880 --> 00:38:09.880]   This is all, this is all good stuff.
[00:38:09.880 --> 00:38:14.120]   You add a flash to the camera and these are all things that make, make a little bit of
[00:38:14.120 --> 00:38:15.120]   sense.
[00:38:15.120 --> 00:38:20.800]   You're at risk because if you put the pencil on, you can't do, you can't do 3D touch.
[00:38:20.800 --> 00:38:21.800]   Right.
[00:38:21.800 --> 00:38:22.800]   I don't have 3D touches.
[00:38:22.800 --> 00:38:23.800]   There's separate systems.
[00:38:23.800 --> 00:38:27.400]   I know I've had 3D touch anyway.
[00:38:27.400 --> 00:38:28.400]   So it doesn't matter.
[00:38:28.400 --> 00:38:29.400]   You don't care about trying to get that.
[00:38:29.400 --> 00:38:30.400]   No.
[00:38:30.400 --> 00:38:35.240]   And I, and I don't think you worry about cannibalizing sales of the iPad Pro because I think ultimately
[00:38:35.240 --> 00:38:39.400]   the people shouldn't be forced into buying an iPad Pro because it's the only one that
[00:38:39.400 --> 00:38:40.400]   uses the pencil.
[00:38:40.400 --> 00:38:43.760]   I would actually really welcome a air with the pencil.
[00:38:43.760 --> 00:38:45.320]   I think a lot of people would.
[00:38:45.320 --> 00:38:46.680]   And the air looks so small now.
[00:38:46.680 --> 00:38:47.680]   I know it does.
[00:38:47.680 --> 00:38:53.480]   I mean, I absolutely, I'm one handing the iPad Pro like daily and I actually, I, no joke.
[00:38:53.480 --> 00:38:59.080]   I was doing like an inventory of loaner stuff in my office and I'm like holding this gold
[00:38:59.080 --> 00:39:02.720]   iPad mini and I'm like, when did Apple send me a gold iPad?
[00:39:02.720 --> 00:39:03.720]   Damn it.
[00:39:03.720 --> 00:39:04.720]   Wait a minute.
[00:39:04.720 --> 00:39:05.720]   Did they send it?
[00:39:05.720 --> 00:39:06.720]   And then I, I'm a serious error.
[00:39:06.720 --> 00:39:08.760]   I had this on my hand for three.
[00:39:08.760 --> 00:39:09.760]   Okay.
[00:39:09.760 --> 00:39:10.760]   This is an iPad air.
[00:39:10.760 --> 00:39:11.760]   It's not an iPad.
[00:39:11.760 --> 00:39:12.760]   Okay.
[00:39:12.760 --> 00:39:19.320]   I see like an iPhone plus on my sofa and I think it's an iPad mini or I see an iPad air
[00:39:19.320 --> 00:39:21.040]   on myself and think it's an iPad mini.
[00:39:21.040 --> 00:39:23.120]   It's just my whole perspective has been cute.
[00:39:23.120 --> 00:39:26.960]   We went through that with phones, which we're now completely comfortable with a larger
[00:39:26.960 --> 00:39:27.960]   phone.
[00:39:27.960 --> 00:39:32.080]   You see the five SE when you see it as a foreign choice to look mini.
[00:39:32.080 --> 00:39:34.280]   Yeah, but there's some people, some people will love it.
[00:39:34.280 --> 00:39:35.280]   I understand.
[00:39:35.280 --> 00:39:36.280]   It doesn't have to be that for everybody.
[00:39:36.280 --> 00:39:37.280]   It can, it can spread out.
[00:39:37.280 --> 00:39:38.280]   It is a brain thing.
[00:39:38.280 --> 00:39:41.680]   I think you're right, Renee, that we just adjust and what becomes the norm.
[00:39:41.680 --> 00:39:42.680]   It's a new normal.
[00:39:42.680 --> 00:39:43.680]   Yeah.
[00:39:43.680 --> 00:39:47.920]   And then the mini will seem really tiny, although I really like the mini for.
[00:39:47.920 --> 00:39:49.160]   That's my kind of like go to it.
[00:39:49.160 --> 00:39:50.160]   It's fantastic.
[00:39:50.160 --> 00:39:51.160]   Yeah.
[00:39:51.160 --> 00:39:53.080]   It's, it's, it becomes field notes.
[00:39:53.080 --> 00:39:59.080]   I don't, I don't know if it's, if having a real Apple pencil on it is essential, but
[00:39:59.080 --> 00:40:04.320]   I mean, I was, Jason, you said, tell me about how like he was, he doesn't use his full-sized
[00:40:04.320 --> 00:40:07.440]   iPad anymore since it got the mini uses that for so much work.
[00:40:07.440 --> 00:40:13.480]   And I was a little bit skeptical until I decided that it was time to stop using my iPad 3 and
[00:40:13.480 --> 00:40:14.680]   I replaced it with them.
[00:40:14.680 --> 00:40:15.760]   I didn't replace with a mini.
[00:40:15.760 --> 00:40:19.280]   I bought a mini because I knew that I'm going to definitely get a pro at the end of the year,
[00:40:19.280 --> 00:40:23.000]   but I want a modern iPad with a touch ID and I'll be darned.
[00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:27.160]   I was using it all the time just as a writing tool and it was just, I just did not miss the
[00:40:27.160 --> 00:40:29.080]   extra screen size whatsoever.
[00:40:29.080 --> 00:40:31.760]   It's, it's, there's a lot of interesting data floating around.
[00:40:31.760 --> 00:40:38.480]   It's not a one-to-one correlation between the behavior of Windows consumers and Apple consumers,
[00:40:38.480 --> 00:40:43.440]   but it was there, we're getting Microsoft released some data about the sales of the
[00:40:43.440 --> 00:40:48.840]   Surface Pro, for instance, and we're asked the end of the convertibles in general.
[00:40:48.840 --> 00:40:54.040]   We're asked convertible Windows laptops are selling gangbusters, like the Surface Pro,
[00:40:54.040 --> 00:40:58.240]   excuse me, the Surface Book is selling extremely well.
[00:40:58.240 --> 00:41:05.600]   Lenovo, HP, all these other machines that are dockable screens that dock into a keyboard
[00:41:05.600 --> 00:41:08.720]   and turn into a laptop or fold like a yoga machine.
[00:41:08.720 --> 00:41:14.880]   Those are doing extremely well, but the market for Windows tablets that are just tablets
[00:41:14.880 --> 00:41:20.640]   and you have to really buy a Bluetooth keyboard, there's just very little interest in that.
[00:41:20.640 --> 00:41:24.240]   So I don't think that there's, again, there are two separate markets, but it'd be, it's
[00:41:24.240 --> 00:41:31.080]   an interesting thing to consider if people want, people either want a smaller device that is
[00:41:31.080 --> 00:41:35.120]   like a book-like touchscreen or they want something that is more like a notebook, but
[00:41:35.120 --> 00:41:40.040]   if you show them something that's even 9.7 inches, let alone 13 inches, they're saying,
[00:41:40.040 --> 00:41:42.680]   I don't know how to integrate this into my life.
[00:41:42.680 --> 00:41:45.760]   It's something at least to be aware of and think about as we're trying to figure out
[00:41:45.760 --> 00:41:51.600]   how Apple might want to get that curve of iPad sales to finally be going skyward instead
[00:41:51.600 --> 00:41:52.600]   of earthward.
[00:41:52.600 --> 00:41:54.600]   I'm a iPad pro envy, so I had Greg bring you my eye.
[00:41:54.600 --> 00:41:55.600]   Oh nice.
[00:41:55.600 --> 00:42:00.160]   Well, you're using just the standard cover, not the smart, not the tipper.
[00:42:00.160 --> 00:42:02.880]   Yeah, I've got the smart keyboard, but I don't really love it.
[00:42:02.880 --> 00:42:07.560]   It's okay, but most of the time when I want to type on my iPad pro, I will, I'd rather
[00:42:07.560 --> 00:42:11.360]   just use a really good Bluetooth keyboard and a standard, honestly.
[00:42:11.360 --> 00:42:14.720]   And because it's a smart keyboard, although it's an okay keyboard, it's actually kind
[00:42:14.720 --> 00:42:15.720]   of a terrible cover.
[00:42:15.720 --> 00:42:18.320]   It's thick and unwieldy and I don't love it.
[00:42:18.320 --> 00:42:20.480]   I don't carry mine around, so I don't really.
[00:42:20.480 --> 00:42:21.480]   I use the same one as you.
[00:42:21.480 --> 00:42:22.480]   I use it all the time.
[00:42:22.480 --> 00:42:23.760]   I just traveled with it for a week.
[00:42:23.760 --> 00:42:24.760]   I got the logic.
[00:42:24.760 --> 00:42:28.320]   I got the two and it got so big and bulky, I decided to go with the Apple.
[00:42:28.320 --> 00:42:32.960]   Yeah, I waste all it's, it's like I'm with Jason, like I always travel with just a full
[00:42:32.960 --> 00:42:34.400]   sized Bluetooth keyboard.
[00:42:34.400 --> 00:42:39.800]   I think I think that the smart cover there is nice for a certain type of user who really
[00:42:39.800 --> 00:42:44.320]   just wants to do casual typing and they don't want to add more more bulk they have to.
[00:42:44.320 --> 00:42:48.640]   And I think that this is the Apple, I believe that Apple chose this style because they knew
[00:42:48.640 --> 00:42:53.120]   that they could execute that brilliantly and other companies could do thick and cumbersome
[00:42:53.120 --> 00:42:55.160]   but more comfortable very, very well.
[00:42:55.160 --> 00:43:00.040]   But it's just for me, every time I say, you know, Ray, you post so much stuff from your
[00:43:00.040 --> 00:43:02.480]   Instagram of like working on planes.
[00:43:02.480 --> 00:43:05.920]   And I'm like, I know how much he writes every single week.
[00:43:05.920 --> 00:43:10.800]   I would have, I would, I would probably switch to speech to text if I had to write my daily
[00:43:10.800 --> 00:43:13.840]   volume of stuff and that was the only keyboard I had available.
[00:43:13.840 --> 00:43:15.280]   I just can't get used to it as a speed.
[00:43:15.280 --> 00:43:17.000]   After five minutes, it just feels like a keyboard.
[00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:18.480]   Like, I don't know, my brain is funny.
[00:43:18.480 --> 00:43:21.480]   After about five minutes type you on anything, it just feels normal and I start typing.
[00:43:21.480 --> 00:43:22.480]   I don't know.
[00:43:22.480 --> 00:43:23.480]   I don't know.
[00:43:23.480 --> 00:43:24.480]   Highly resilient.
[00:43:24.480 --> 00:43:25.480]   That's good.
[00:43:25.480 --> 00:43:30.240]   Well, I think you're born to be a writer is what it is.
[00:43:30.240 --> 00:43:31.240]   Let's see.
[00:43:31.240 --> 00:43:32.240]   Just have no taste.
[00:43:32.240 --> 00:43:33.240]   Apple watch.
[00:43:33.240 --> 00:43:38.000]   So we'll see an air three, nine, another, you know, nine, ten inch.
[00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:39.000]   Just like the air two.
[00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:41.280]   It's been showing up in server logs for three, three months already.
[00:43:41.280 --> 00:43:42.280]   So it's pretty.
[00:43:42.280 --> 00:43:43.280]   Well, I have the four speakers.
[00:43:43.280 --> 00:43:44.280]   That's the rumor.
[00:43:44.280 --> 00:43:45.280]   Yeah.
[00:43:45.280 --> 00:43:47.200]   I like the four speakers.
[00:43:47.200 --> 00:43:50.200]   You did that on the pro though because you had so much room.
[00:43:50.200 --> 00:43:54.400]   It might not have the big echo chambers, but it'll probably have the right speed.
[00:43:54.400 --> 00:43:56.800]   And that's, and by the way, you don't get all four at once, right?
[00:43:56.800 --> 00:43:59.280]   It's not Dolby surround.
[00:43:59.280 --> 00:44:01.400]   It just so that when you rotate it, it's always there.
[00:44:01.400 --> 00:44:02.880]   It does play all four.
[00:44:02.880 --> 00:44:03.880]   Like it will do.
[00:44:03.880 --> 00:44:06.120]   Yeah, it'll, it'll favor trouble to the top and base.
[00:44:06.120 --> 00:44:08.680]   Oh, I know that.
[00:44:08.680 --> 00:44:10.760]   That's nice.
[00:44:10.760 --> 00:44:13.600]   So maybe the air three will do that.
[00:44:13.600 --> 00:44:17.920]   People that have a little smart keyboard to go along with it, I'd like that.
[00:44:17.920 --> 00:44:19.960]   The report says smart connector.
[00:44:19.960 --> 00:44:23.800]   And then it's unclear on whether that means there'll be a small smart keyboard or not,
[00:44:23.800 --> 00:44:25.760]   but you know, maybe.
[00:44:25.760 --> 00:44:30.920]   And a rear, according to some, a rear LED flash, which would be interesting.
[00:44:30.920 --> 00:44:37.160]   Be acknowledging finally the sad, bitter truth that people take pictures with their iPad.
[00:44:37.160 --> 00:44:40.400]   Well, they having upgraded the cameras in the iPad the last couple of years.
[00:44:40.400 --> 00:44:43.560]   It really is that same acknowledgement that, hey, we didn't think.
[00:44:43.560 --> 00:44:45.280]   People would use it this way, but they do.
[00:44:45.280 --> 00:44:46.680]   So we better make it good.
[00:44:46.680 --> 00:44:47.680]   Do they?
[00:44:47.680 --> 00:44:48.680]   It's not the eight megapixel.
[00:44:48.680 --> 00:44:50.840]   It's is it the same camera as in the phone?
[00:44:50.840 --> 00:44:52.040]   It's eight megapixel still.
[00:44:52.040 --> 00:44:55.600]   Yeah, I have pod touch and the iPads have the same eight megapixel camera.
[00:44:55.600 --> 00:44:56.600]   Okay.
[00:44:56.600 --> 00:44:57.600]   Okay.
[00:44:57.600 --> 00:44:58.600]   Yeah.
[00:44:58.600 --> 00:44:59.600]   I'll also consider FaceTime.
[00:44:59.600 --> 00:45:03.240]   A lot of people are holding their iPads out while their kids play and their grandparents
[00:45:03.240 --> 00:45:04.520]   can see what's going on.
[00:45:04.520 --> 00:45:08.280]   So yeah, it's still, it's still silly.
[00:45:08.280 --> 00:45:12.960]   I've taken pictures with the iPad pro and I never feel like a bigger dork.
[00:45:12.960 --> 00:45:17.560]   I could if I if I could put it on the end of a big broom size selfie stick, I could possibly
[00:45:17.560 --> 00:45:19.520]   feel like a bigger dingus.
[00:45:19.520 --> 00:45:23.080]   You need the carpet over your head and you imagine you're an old timey, wimey.
[00:45:23.080 --> 00:45:25.880]   I like the big viewfinder.
[00:45:25.880 --> 00:45:27.520]   I love the actual size.
[00:45:27.520 --> 00:45:28.920]   It's really a season and sorry.
[00:45:28.920 --> 00:45:32.760]   And eight by seeing an eight by 10 of the picture that you like, oh, yes, I already took
[00:45:32.760 --> 00:45:33.760]   this picture.
[00:45:33.760 --> 00:45:34.760]   Okay, I don't have to tap any buttons.
[00:45:34.760 --> 00:45:36.400]   Then you walk away with no picture.
[00:45:36.400 --> 00:45:40.760]   A sees and sorry, he's a showmaster of none on Netflix, which is wonderful.
[00:45:40.760 --> 00:45:41.960]   He is so funny.
[00:45:41.960 --> 00:45:46.640]   His father, who of course is obsessed, iPad obsessed, but he doesn't know how to use
[00:45:46.640 --> 00:45:47.640]   it.
[00:45:47.640 --> 00:45:48.640]   So you know, a sees comes over.
[00:45:48.640 --> 00:45:50.240]   He says, what can you make this?
[00:45:50.240 --> 00:45:51.240]   Whatever.
[00:45:51.240 --> 00:45:55.120]   And he always uses it to take pictures and it's become kind of where it became a running
[00:45:55.120 --> 00:45:58.160]   joke in the show, which I loved.
[00:45:58.160 --> 00:46:02.880]   And so that's a little bit of the statement that yeah, this is how your dad takes pictures.
[00:46:02.880 --> 00:46:06.560]   Every time I go to any city, any big city and I see tourists like outside the sea and
[00:46:06.560 --> 00:46:09.800]   tower or outside some of the buildings, there's always a bunch of people with their iPads
[00:46:09.800 --> 00:46:11.720]   held up taking pictures of the landmarks.
[00:46:11.720 --> 00:46:12.720]   Yeah.
[00:46:12.720 --> 00:46:19.560]   Well, in fact, when I went on that riverboat cruise, a lot of older people, like really
[00:46:19.560 --> 00:46:25.880]   I think I'm older, but they are really old and almost all of them use their iPads to take
[00:46:25.880 --> 00:46:26.880]   pictures.
[00:46:26.880 --> 00:46:31.520]   I should have some pictures of people on the deck while all of them holding up their
[00:46:31.520 --> 00:46:32.520]   iPads.
[00:46:32.520 --> 00:46:33.520]   It was pretty cute.
[00:46:33.520 --> 00:46:34.680]   It didn't bother me actually.
[00:46:34.680 --> 00:46:37.480]   Again, the brain gets used to these things.
[00:46:37.480 --> 00:46:41.360]   Yeah, well, I got, I was bothered by that just like I was bothered by selfie sticks when
[00:46:41.360 --> 00:46:44.400]   I started seeing them around like the public garden common.
[00:46:44.400 --> 00:46:49.120]   But then I had, I really had to like have one of my like self-opera administrative moments,
[00:46:49.120 --> 00:46:53.840]   which is if they're using their technology in a way that pleases them that doesn't affect
[00:46:53.840 --> 00:46:54.840]   you.
[00:46:54.840 --> 00:46:57.840]   Why are you, why are you feeling, why are you feeling like you need to rush up and say,
[00:46:57.840 --> 00:47:01.240]   you're doing something silly and I need to tell you you're being silly.
[00:47:01.240 --> 00:47:03.240]   It's actually pretty amazing for shooting video.
[00:47:03.240 --> 00:47:04.240]   It's interesting.
[00:47:04.240 --> 00:47:05.240]   You know, it's interesting.
[00:47:05.240 --> 00:47:11.120]   Our 13 year old school, he's in a K through eight has a one to one program and they're
[00:47:11.120 --> 00:47:14.440]   all get, they all have, at least the older kids have iPads.
[00:47:14.440 --> 00:47:19.520]   And one of the things they're doing with these is making movies and they're using their iPad
[00:47:19.520 --> 00:47:24.320]   as video cameras and making, you know, whatever news reports or, you know, learning media,
[00:47:24.320 --> 00:47:25.840]   whatever there it is.
[00:47:25.840 --> 00:47:29.680]   And so this is a, not only, so it's a kind of, at both ends, the younger people are probably
[00:47:29.680 --> 00:47:32.520]   going to be used to doing this as well.
[00:47:32.520 --> 00:47:33.520]   We did it at CES.
[00:47:33.520 --> 00:47:36.360]   A lot of these close ups were done on an iPad because it's such a big viewfinder.
[00:47:36.360 --> 00:47:37.960]   You could easily, yeah, John and Kelly said it up.
[00:47:37.960 --> 00:47:40.360]   You could just hold it and, and move it around.
[00:47:40.360 --> 00:47:43.120]   And you'd always, because it was so big, you could always see exactly what you were shooting.
[00:47:43.120 --> 00:47:44.120]   Look at that.
[00:47:44.120 --> 00:47:45.120]   This is a rig.
[00:47:45.120 --> 00:47:50.360]   We're showing a rig design to do movies with the iPad, including a shotgun mic mounted
[00:47:50.360 --> 00:47:51.360]   on it.
[00:47:51.360 --> 00:47:55.120]   That's why he's wishing that the, the iPad pro it up a 4K camera because if you think
[00:47:55.120 --> 00:47:58.080]   that anything would benefit from like great 4K editing, you'd be able to shoot it right
[00:47:58.080 --> 00:47:59.920]   on the device, edit it right there.
[00:47:59.920 --> 00:48:04.960]   Yeah, I still, I'm baffled that Apple doesn't do better cameras in the iPad.
[00:48:04.960 --> 00:48:06.840]   Let's just acknowledge it and move on, right?
[00:48:06.840 --> 00:48:07.840]   It's time.
[00:48:07.840 --> 00:48:08.840]   I think it's starting to happen.
[00:48:08.840 --> 00:48:10.080]   I think they're, they're finally getting it.
[00:48:10.080 --> 00:48:12.240]   It's also the best way to fight camera citizens.
[00:48:12.240 --> 00:48:13.960]   It's the best way to fight vertical video.
[00:48:13.960 --> 00:48:17.680]   You do tend to shoot video in landscape on an iPad.
[00:48:17.680 --> 00:48:21.560]   Well, because you got to, you got to need two hands to hold that damn thing up.
[00:48:21.560 --> 00:48:25.800]   So I have yet to see anybody shoot vertical video on an iPad.
[00:48:25.800 --> 00:48:28.560]   Except for the FaceTime camera, because it's on the top, you always kind of want to go
[00:48:28.560 --> 00:48:29.560]   vertical with it.
[00:48:29.560 --> 00:48:32.400]   Otherwise you cover it with your hand or you have to look sideways into it.
[00:48:32.400 --> 00:48:35.680]   You know, that's another thing that I think we need to move beyond.
[00:48:35.680 --> 00:48:43.160]   It's like there are people who cannot listen to someone referred to a spider as an insect
[00:48:43.160 --> 00:48:44.680]   without correcting them.
[00:48:44.680 --> 00:48:48.200]   Just like, again, if it get used to the fact that there are people who are going to shoot
[00:48:48.200 --> 00:48:52.480]   video like this, because that's the natural way or maybe because they're shooting a picture
[00:48:52.480 --> 00:48:56.280]   of someone who's actual vertical and it makes sense for them to do that.
[00:48:56.280 --> 00:49:02.040]   It's okay for you to simply watch this video, think to yourself, oh no, it's another vertical
[00:49:02.040 --> 00:49:03.840]   video and then not type anything.
[00:49:03.840 --> 00:49:04.840]   Don't say anything.
[00:49:04.840 --> 00:49:05.840]   I'm with you Andy.
[00:49:05.840 --> 00:49:09.440]   I've been, I've been, I've been, I was an early supporter of vertical video.
[00:49:09.440 --> 00:49:14.160]   I want to point out and there's a couple of trends, Periscope and Meerkats, of course,
[00:49:14.160 --> 00:49:19.320]   last year, but now Snapchat, a lot of people are getting, a lot of young people are getting
[00:49:19.320 --> 00:49:24.040]   their news from Snapchat and of course they're not watching it in the landscape.
[00:49:24.040 --> 00:49:27.080]   They're watching it and here's, if you could show this, Jason.
[00:49:27.080 --> 00:49:29.080]   That's just YouTube.
[00:49:29.080 --> 00:49:30.080]   That's weird.
[00:49:30.080 --> 00:49:31.080]   YouTube should cut off.
[00:49:31.080 --> 00:49:32.080]   It's a vertical.
[00:49:32.080 --> 00:49:33.080]   See this?
[00:49:33.080 --> 00:49:35.880]   Anyway, I'll show it here.
[00:49:35.880 --> 00:49:37.960]   So this is the Iowa caucuses.
[00:49:37.960 --> 00:49:43.480]   This is that guy who left CNN to do news on Snapchat and he's doing news on Snapchat.
[00:49:43.480 --> 00:49:44.480]   What is it?
[00:49:44.480 --> 00:49:45.480]   It's vertical video.
[00:49:45.480 --> 00:49:50.040]   So if you grow up in this as your, as your news, you're not going to be bothered by vertical
[00:49:50.040 --> 00:49:51.040]   video.
[00:49:51.040 --> 00:49:53.440]   That's, that's, that's, that's how people are going to be watching that.
[00:49:53.440 --> 00:49:56.040]   They're going to, they're not going to turn their, they're not learning to turn their
[00:49:56.040 --> 00:50:00.200]   phones on their side every time that they watch video because this is how phones are
[00:50:00.200 --> 00:50:01.200]   held.
[00:50:01.200 --> 00:50:06.040]   Sometimes it's, it's, it's painful when it's pointed, when it's, you realize that the only
[00:50:06.040 --> 00:50:10.840]   reason why you're upset by this is that you are not 23 years old.
[00:50:10.840 --> 00:50:11.840]   Yes.
[00:50:11.840 --> 00:50:15.880]   And somebody who is 23 years old would understand and appreciate this implicitly.
[00:50:15.880 --> 00:50:16.880]   We're asked for you.
[00:50:16.880 --> 00:50:22.920]   There's a massive disconnect because you are closer to or through middle age.
[00:50:22.920 --> 00:50:25.280]   Let us talk about the watch.
[00:50:25.280 --> 00:50:31.560]   That will be a, also we hear a part of the March 15th announcement.
[00:50:31.560 --> 00:50:32.560]   What do we know?
[00:50:32.560 --> 00:50:33.560]   What do we think?
[00:50:33.560 --> 00:50:34.560]   Or bands?
[00:50:34.560 --> 00:50:37.400]   I mean, there've been bands, we've seen them, Johnny, I showed some off the fashion shows.
[00:50:37.400 --> 00:50:40.560]   There've been others like the Black Milanese loop that you, if you were careful, you could
[00:50:40.560 --> 00:50:44.200]   have seen people in Cupertino wearing it for over a year, but it was just never released
[00:50:44.200 --> 00:50:46.120]   because they wanted to get it to a certain technical standard.
[00:50:46.120 --> 00:50:48.720]   So all, all of those things, it makes it highly seasonal now.
[00:50:48.720 --> 00:50:51.200]   You can refresh the Apple watch just by going with new bands.
[00:50:51.200 --> 00:50:52.200]   I love it.
[00:50:52.200 --> 00:50:53.200]   This is the Renee Richie way.
[00:50:53.200 --> 00:50:55.960]   I'm going to be so poor, Leo.
[00:50:55.960 --> 00:50:57.360]   It's not going to be the phone.
[00:50:57.360 --> 00:50:58.360]   It's not going to be the iPad.
[00:50:58.360 --> 00:51:02.600]   It's going to be those darn bands, including according to gear patrol.
[00:51:02.600 --> 00:51:03.760]   Oh, a NATO strap.
[00:51:03.760 --> 00:51:04.760]   A NATO strap.
[00:51:04.760 --> 00:51:05.760]   What does that mean?
[00:51:05.760 --> 00:51:08.960]   It's like a, what nylon fabric band instead?
[00:51:08.960 --> 00:51:09.960]   More options.
[00:51:09.960 --> 00:51:10.960]   Yeah.
[00:51:10.960 --> 00:51:11.960]   Yeah.
[00:51:11.960 --> 00:51:16.680]   I wouldn't say Renee, I just, I just got this mental image of you, like a Sean Connery
[00:51:16.680 --> 00:51:21.280]   and Zardoz only like in the post apocalypse, you're just dressed completely in straps.
[00:51:21.280 --> 00:51:24.440]   Oh, well, I will watch a trash.
[00:51:24.440 --> 00:51:26.720]   I will not allow this to continue.
[00:51:26.720 --> 00:51:28.200]   All right.
[00:51:28.200 --> 00:51:29.720]   Well, what day of the week?
[00:51:29.720 --> 00:51:30.720]   It must be a Tuesday.
[00:51:30.720 --> 00:51:31.720]   Yeah.
[00:51:31.720 --> 00:51:32.720]   Good.
[00:51:32.720 --> 00:51:33.720]   All right.
[00:51:33.720 --> 00:51:35.120]   So Tuesday, unless it can't be then it's when you all have a date, unless you're going
[00:51:35.120 --> 00:51:39.760]   to be in, you think they'll do it at Flint Center in Cupertino or will they do it?
[00:51:39.760 --> 00:51:41.600]   They did the last one at Flint Center.
[00:51:41.600 --> 00:51:44.440]   I think they're slowly getting the press used to coming to Cupertino because of course
[00:51:44.440 --> 00:51:46.440]   it's going to be in the new and the new campus.
[00:51:46.440 --> 00:51:48.080]   I think it wasn't the last watch event though.
[00:51:48.080 --> 00:51:49.480]   Wasn't that your, but why not?
[00:51:49.480 --> 00:51:52.880]   I think the last watch was, but your last event was.
[00:51:52.880 --> 00:51:56.560]   Well, it's also a question of how big is this event really?
[00:51:56.560 --> 00:52:00.400]   If it's a, if it's a, they might choose a smaller venue and invite a smaller number
[00:52:00.400 --> 00:52:04.840]   of people not spend a lot of money on it, they could even do it at Town Hall.
[00:52:04.840 --> 00:52:08.960]   It's possible because it's a, a little phone and a, a bump to an iPad.
[00:52:08.960 --> 00:52:10.240]   It's like a little room for a little home.
[00:52:10.240 --> 00:52:13.880]   It's just a little, you know, it's a collection of, of items.
[00:52:13.880 --> 00:52:18.360]   It's not, not that it isn't interesting, but is it, it's not the iPhone event.
[00:52:18.360 --> 00:52:23.280]   When you're the second biggest company in the world, it's important.
[00:52:23.280 --> 00:52:24.280]   It behooves you.
[00:52:24.280 --> 00:52:26.360]   It behooves you to have a big event.
[00:52:26.360 --> 00:52:30.360]   Maybe they'll just stand in the center of the construction site at campus too and do
[00:52:30.360 --> 00:52:31.360]   it there.
[00:52:31.360 --> 00:52:32.360]   Oh, we're happy.
[00:52:32.360 --> 00:52:33.360]   Cool.
[00:52:33.360 --> 00:52:34.360]   Shout, but, but bullhorn.
[00:52:34.360 --> 00:52:36.360]   Nobody, nobody seems to be anticipating that Apple's going to announce any feature that's
[00:52:36.360 --> 00:52:39.600]   brand new, that they're going to be refreshes and updates.
[00:52:39.600 --> 00:52:42.280]   So yeah, I mean, I, I, I agree with Jason.
[00:52:42.280 --> 00:52:45.000]   I wouldn't be surprised if this were Town Hall thing.
[00:52:45.000 --> 00:52:49.640]   And there'll be iOS 9.32 and Craig could talk about the education features, for example,
[00:52:49.640 --> 00:52:51.520]   they could do a little segment on night shift.
[00:52:51.520 --> 00:52:55.240]   So there is enough to make it into a, into a mini event.
[00:52:55.240 --> 00:52:57.840]   The Apple campus comes along every month.
[00:52:57.840 --> 00:52:59.160]   We get an update.
[00:52:59.160 --> 00:53:05.760]   This is the February drone update, ladies and gentlemen, on YouTube of the Apple campus.
[00:53:05.760 --> 00:53:09.080]   Is there music on this, Jason?
[00:53:09.080 --> 00:53:10.080]   Something dubstep-ish.
[00:53:10.080 --> 00:53:14.000]   He's taking this seriously, this guy now.
[00:53:14.000 --> 00:53:17.240]   That's really, I made a joke that I didn't see any evidence of a BJ to an Apple would
[00:53:17.240 --> 00:53:20.760]   be horribly doomed if people took it seriously and wondered why we weren't reporting on the
[00:53:20.760 --> 00:53:21.760]   lack of bars.
[00:53:21.760 --> 00:53:24.200]   It is, it is coming along.
[00:53:24.200 --> 00:53:28.400]   I mean, you really, the shape of the campus is clear and glass is starting to go in that
[00:53:28.400 --> 00:53:29.760]   famous curved glass.
[00:53:29.760 --> 00:53:32.160]   This is, this is the inside.
[00:53:32.160 --> 00:53:34.400]   So it's going to have a, you know, it's a doughnut.
[00:53:34.400 --> 00:53:36.720]   So you have curved glass on inside and outside.
[00:53:36.720 --> 00:53:37.720]   Oh, no.
[00:53:37.720 --> 00:53:38.720]   Donuts.
[00:53:38.720 --> 00:53:43.000]   Lifting roof segment into place with a giant crane.
[00:53:43.000 --> 00:53:46.880]   Don't imagine that at some point, Apple's going to put an anti-air defense system in
[00:53:46.880 --> 00:53:47.880]   there.
[00:53:47.880 --> 00:53:48.880]   You got the Pentagon.
[00:53:48.880 --> 00:53:49.880]   This is the Infinagon.
[00:53:49.880 --> 00:53:53.760]   No, I mean, they, they, they, they, they, they like their privacy and I wonder if there's
[00:53:53.760 --> 00:53:57.600]   going to be a no-fly or there's going to be Apple drones that come out to take on the,
[00:53:57.600 --> 00:53:58.600]   the public drones.
[00:53:58.600 --> 00:53:59.800]   Yeah, I'm surprised that this continues.
[00:53:59.800 --> 00:54:02.680]   He's been doing this for months now.
[00:54:02.680 --> 00:54:03.680]   Roof for underground auditorium.
[00:54:03.680 --> 00:54:04.680]   Hey, that's where we'll be.
[00:54:04.680 --> 00:54:08.520]   Hey, it looks like a piece of, hey, look at the, hey, look at the iPod market share.
[00:54:08.520 --> 00:54:11.000]   Tiny slice of pie.
[00:54:11.000 --> 00:54:12.000]   So that's interesting.
[00:54:12.000 --> 00:54:14.840]   The round auditorium is actually separate.
[00:54:14.840 --> 00:54:18.200]   I thought it was in the circle campus, but it's separate.
[00:54:18.200 --> 00:54:19.200]   That makes sense.
[00:54:19.200 --> 00:54:22.040]   You gotta keep the filthy journalists sound.
[00:54:22.040 --> 00:54:23.040]   Yeah.
[00:54:23.040 --> 00:54:24.040]   Refractly.
[00:54:24.040 --> 00:54:27.360]   So this is a, I wonder if it's going to have like an underground like subway system, like
[00:54:27.360 --> 00:54:32.560]   they have a Disney world or in Congress where there's, if you, if you're in the, if you're
[00:54:32.560 --> 00:54:37.600]   in the know or if you're accompanied by senior executive, you can basically use the hyperloop.
[00:54:37.600 --> 00:54:38.600]   Yeah.
[00:54:38.600 --> 00:54:40.640]   Otherwise you got to, you got to walk or golf cart.
[00:54:40.640 --> 00:54:44.160]   And massive solar array on the West parking lot.
[00:54:44.160 --> 00:54:45.160]   Wow.
[00:54:45.160 --> 00:54:46.800]   That is a lot of panels.
[00:54:46.800 --> 00:54:49.560]   So I'm not even joking.
[00:54:49.560 --> 00:54:50.560]   That's, that's Jason.
[00:54:50.560 --> 00:54:52.840]   Jason made such a good point.
[00:54:52.840 --> 00:54:58.520]   The mind, we've all had so much experience with Apple over many, many years, the mind
[00:54:58.520 --> 00:55:05.040]   boggles to imagine if Apple were going to construct a facility to have like press and
[00:55:05.040 --> 00:55:11.720]   media events in where every single, starting from bare ground, everything in this building
[00:55:11.720 --> 00:55:17.920]   and around it is tailored towards the way that Apple wants to handle the media.
[00:55:17.920 --> 00:55:19.800]   I'm, I'm the first time I'm at that event.
[00:55:19.800 --> 00:55:22.040]   I'm chipping, I'm checking for outlines of trap doors.
[00:55:22.040 --> 00:55:28.080]   I'm checking for like rotating a wall sconce that says at some point someone says, that's
[00:55:28.080 --> 00:55:29.880]   one 20 p.m.
[00:55:29.880 --> 00:55:36.760]   Look over to that bench over there, lean back twice on then tapped face on this panel.
[00:55:36.760 --> 00:55:38.640]   A door will open up.
[00:55:38.640 --> 00:55:41.520]   You will have 20 minutes with Johnny.
[00:55:41.520 --> 00:55:42.520]   It's funny.
[00:55:42.520 --> 00:55:45.040]   You know, and I know this is sort of inside baseball, but I know some people like to
[00:55:45.040 --> 00:55:47.960]   hear about it is Apple does have things it likes to do with these events.
[00:55:47.960 --> 00:55:52.960]   And in some ways they are dictated like why on two of their most recent major events,
[00:55:52.960 --> 00:55:58.440]   the two last iPhone events, they did whole construction projects next to their venue in
[00:55:58.440 --> 00:55:59.800]   order to get what they wanted.
[00:55:59.800 --> 00:56:04.240]   In one case they built sort of stuff inside the venue and one right next to the venue.
[00:56:04.240 --> 00:56:08.760]   And it's because they want to have a big stage and a bunch of seats, but they also
[00:56:08.760 --> 00:56:12.960]   need a hands-on area and there's a ratio there at the California theater in San Jose.
[00:56:12.960 --> 00:56:15.600]   One of the problems was that the hands-on area was too small afterward.
[00:56:15.600 --> 00:56:19.640]   So there's a limit to how much press you can invite because then afterward all the press
[00:56:19.640 --> 00:56:21.040]   needs to see your products.
[00:56:21.040 --> 00:56:24.520]   So the more press you invite, the bigger the hands-on area needs to be.
[00:56:24.520 --> 00:56:28.000]   And then there are usually briefings and they pull a smaller group of journalists.
[00:56:28.000 --> 00:56:33.080]   It's not all of them and they get a press briefing later and that's sort of in a backroom somewhere.
[00:56:33.080 --> 00:56:38.960]   So they have to do a lot of work sometimes to make these other venues the way they want.
[00:56:38.960 --> 00:56:43.600]   Whereas this thing is going to have everything that they want including places for hands-on
[00:56:43.600 --> 00:56:46.680]   areas, including places for private briefings.
[00:56:46.680 --> 00:56:50.160]   And it'll be interesting to see will it be behind a secret bookshelf?
[00:56:50.160 --> 00:56:51.160]   Possibly.
[00:56:51.160 --> 00:56:53.120]   Andy, we'll have to see.
[00:56:53.120 --> 00:56:56.440]   Not just that, but remember that they're also going to want to have, again, if they're
[00:56:56.440 --> 00:57:00.280]   building this from the ground up, they're going to have VIP suites that are really nicely
[00:57:00.280 --> 00:57:06.320]   tricked out because not just for Elvis Costello and the Foo Fighters, but for people that
[00:57:06.320 --> 00:57:10.560]   they want to impress with what they've got planned.
[00:57:10.560 --> 00:57:17.080]   And also not just impress with their products, but also part of that sort of romance that
[00:57:17.080 --> 00:57:23.000]   they want to build with certain people in industry, in the media, in celebrity culture
[00:57:23.000 --> 00:57:24.840]   to say that, well, not everybody.
[00:57:24.840 --> 00:57:26.240]   You'll have to wait outside.
[00:57:26.240 --> 00:57:29.880]   We've got you a, we know that you're so famous, Elton John, that you don't want to mingle,
[00:57:29.880 --> 00:57:33.280]   but you definitely want to be in on the action where you have this beautiful, not just a
[00:57:33.280 --> 00:57:36.200]   private room, but a like a high roller suite.
[00:57:36.200 --> 00:57:37.200]   That's enough for you.
[00:57:37.200 --> 00:57:40.560]   And I also bet that there are going to be at least two catering kitchens in there.
[00:57:40.560 --> 00:57:47.200]   One that is can put out snacks and coffee for 200 ink stain wretches, but also one that
[00:57:47.200 --> 00:57:50.120]   could do the Thomas Keller food service for 200.
[00:57:50.120 --> 00:57:51.120]   Yeah.
[00:57:51.120 --> 00:57:55.080]   And you know, at your bibweina, I waited in the line for the men's room with Al Gore,
[00:57:55.080 --> 00:57:56.080]   right?
[00:57:56.080 --> 00:57:57.560]   He's waiting the same line as me.
[00:57:57.560 --> 00:57:58.560]   No, he should not.
[00:57:58.560 --> 00:57:59.560]   He drives the seats.
[00:57:59.560 --> 00:58:00.560]   He needs his own.
[00:58:00.560 --> 00:58:01.560]   He was a vice president.
[00:58:01.560 --> 00:58:02.560]   He's a brand for president.
[00:58:02.560 --> 00:58:03.560]   He's on the board.
[00:58:03.560 --> 00:58:07.480]   He should not be in the line that I'm in, but he was because that's there's the one
[00:58:07.480 --> 00:58:08.480]   that people.
[00:58:08.480 --> 00:58:09.480]   It's a matter of the people.
[00:58:09.480 --> 00:58:10.480]   Yeah.
[00:58:10.480 --> 00:58:11.480]   And you're absolutely right.
[00:58:11.480 --> 00:58:15.040]   There's no way, Andy, that Tim Cook's going to walk across the lot parking lot to
[00:58:15.040 --> 00:58:16.040]   get there.
[00:58:16.040 --> 00:58:17.040]   He's going to take an underground.
[00:58:17.040 --> 00:58:18.040]   Yeah.
[00:58:18.040 --> 00:58:19.040]   He needs his fitness rings, Leo.
[00:58:19.040 --> 00:58:21.200]   I mean, those things all fill themselves.
[00:58:21.200 --> 00:58:26.040]   But another another another inside baseball thing is that like Jason said, there levels
[00:58:26.040 --> 00:58:29.600]   of access where you get invited to the thing or you don't.
[00:58:29.600 --> 00:58:32.760]   If you get invited thing, you might get a briefing or you might not.
[00:58:32.760 --> 00:58:37.600]   You might get not just a briefing, but a briefing with somebody who was on the stage.
[00:58:37.600 --> 00:58:38.880]   And that's a smaller group.
[00:58:38.880 --> 00:58:45.920]   And sometimes it's rather awkward when because of the way they've set up the venue, the people
[00:58:45.920 --> 00:58:50.880]   like four to six people who are actually going to talk to Tim Cook afterward, they got
[00:58:50.880 --> 00:58:55.440]   it just sort of hang around looking just sort of, okay, we're obviously standing here in
[00:58:55.440 --> 00:58:57.880]   this corner of this campus for absolutely no reason.
[00:58:57.880 --> 00:58:59.880]   It doesn't look suspicious at all.
[00:58:59.880 --> 00:59:04.280]   And then you will see Tim Cook with his entourage come up there and he's glad to hand them.
[00:59:04.280 --> 00:59:08.920]   And it'd be nicer if they had the ability to not have that sort of thing have to happen
[00:59:08.920 --> 00:59:09.920]   in public.
[00:59:09.920 --> 00:59:14.800]   If once again, if they're underground corridors where people, you know, you don't have to
[00:59:14.800 --> 00:59:20.080]   see Johnny Ive or Craig or anybody with their big foam heads off, they can actually, you
[00:59:20.080 --> 00:59:23.640]   know, translocate for one place to another outside of the eye of the public.
[00:59:23.640 --> 00:59:24.640]   Wow.
[00:59:24.640 --> 00:59:25.640]   That's amazing.
[00:59:25.640 --> 00:59:29.320]   The TV trucks, they have to line up for their satellite coverage and for the stand up and
[00:59:29.320 --> 00:59:30.320]   all of that.
[00:59:30.320 --> 00:59:33.240]   All of that has to be factored into this too, which is kind of brilliant.
[00:59:33.240 --> 00:59:36.080]   Like they know what an apple event is like and they're going to build this for an apple.
[00:59:36.080 --> 00:59:38.880]   Here's still, this is again from Duncan's in failed video.
[00:59:38.880 --> 00:59:40.480]   He does such a good job of these.
[00:59:40.480 --> 00:59:42.400]   You can see there is just off the road.
[00:59:42.400 --> 00:59:44.440]   So they will be able to pull right in.
[00:59:44.440 --> 00:59:49.640]   What's interesting is there's, it doesn't look that big, the round part, but notice a
[00:59:49.640 --> 00:59:52.080]   large building behind it.
[00:59:52.080 --> 00:59:55.440]   And I'm sure that is exactly what you guys, there we go.
[00:59:55.440 --> 00:59:59.400]   We're just describing, oh, the round part is a lobby.
[00:59:59.400 --> 01:00:01.000]   We're looking at a plan now.
[01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:03.560]   So the auditorium is actually in the square.
[01:00:03.560 --> 01:00:04.560]   Interesting.
[01:00:04.560 --> 01:00:05.560]   Attached.
[01:00:05.560 --> 01:00:06.560]   I just thought the round part was where they.
[01:00:06.560 --> 01:00:07.560]   Right.
[01:00:07.560 --> 01:00:10.200]   So that's your big lobby setup area and then you flow back in the basketball game.
[01:00:10.200 --> 01:00:12.640]   You can have some basketball games out in the lobby.
[01:00:12.640 --> 01:00:14.040]   But then for the big show, you go back.
[01:00:14.040 --> 01:00:15.560]   Where'd you get these plans, Jason Clant?
[01:00:15.560 --> 01:00:16.560]   This is this from the.
[01:00:16.560 --> 01:00:17.560]   It's probably City of.
[01:00:17.560 --> 01:00:18.560]   You know, yeah.
[01:00:18.560 --> 01:00:20.560]   From I download blog.
[01:00:20.560 --> 01:00:21.560]   Yeah.
[01:00:21.560 --> 01:00:26.640]   OK, so I'm in for an ocean is 11 sort of video where it starts off with you at the
[01:00:26.640 --> 01:00:30.720]   Twithouse unrolling these plans as we circle around it.
[01:00:30.720 --> 01:00:31.720]   Much like the.
[01:00:31.720 --> 01:00:33.080]   Yeah, much like the.
[01:00:33.080 --> 01:00:34.080]   Yes.
[01:00:34.080 --> 01:00:37.880]   I need a pool table and 12 cons.
[01:00:37.880 --> 01:00:41.400]   Much like the Apple store, it's down.
[01:00:41.400 --> 01:00:42.840]   You have a beautiful entrance.
[01:00:42.840 --> 01:00:47.280]   That's the round part and you descend then down into the ground.
[01:00:47.280 --> 01:00:49.960]   So the main auditorium part, it goes.
[01:00:49.960 --> 01:00:54.320]   Yeah, it's down below is underground, which means it could be a lot larger than we see.
[01:00:54.320 --> 01:00:55.320]   It could go.
[01:00:55.320 --> 01:00:57.600]   In fact, the center of the earth.
[01:00:57.600 --> 01:00:59.720]   Well, it's like Minecraft actually.
[01:00:59.720 --> 01:01:02.360]   The garage is mostly underground.
[01:01:02.360 --> 01:01:04.720]   The garage you see is kind of excess parking.
[01:01:04.720 --> 01:01:05.920]   I'm looking at that kind of way.
[01:01:05.920 --> 01:01:09.800]   I'm just thinking about an XKCD comic.
[01:01:09.800 --> 01:01:12.440]   How much we're going to have to scroll, scroll, scroll to see all of that.
[01:01:12.440 --> 01:01:17.040]   So it's referred to as exhibition space, the big circular area.
[01:01:17.040 --> 01:01:20.240]   So that may actually be where your hands on area is.
[01:01:20.240 --> 01:01:25.840]   And so you come in perhaps on the side or perhaps through the center area, but maybe
[01:01:25.840 --> 01:01:27.360]   it's in between the two.
[01:01:27.360 --> 01:01:29.560]   You come in there and go into the auditorium.
[01:01:29.560 --> 01:01:31.320]   Hang a left if you want to see the show.
[01:01:31.320 --> 01:01:32.320]   And you're right.
[01:01:32.320 --> 01:01:33.640]   You want to see this stuff.
[01:01:33.640 --> 01:01:39.560]   Now you think that they've also sort of factored in like at ILM.
[01:01:39.560 --> 01:01:44.280]   They have this beautiful THX theater that is just off of the main lobby.
[01:01:44.280 --> 01:01:47.000]   So that they want to do an academy screening or they do want to do some sort of a book
[01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:48.440]   or a public fundraising event.
[01:01:48.440 --> 01:01:51.720]   They can let people use that space without letting them into the campus.
[01:01:51.720 --> 01:01:55.440]   You think that maybe they're also thinking that if this is going to be dark for three
[01:01:55.440 --> 01:01:59.920]   or four days and there is a cause or something that they really, really like, they could
[01:01:59.920 --> 01:02:03.600]   give people these, not only the state of the art facilities, but what I'm sure is a state
[01:02:03.600 --> 01:02:06.000]   of the art broadcast control room and all the other amenities.
[01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:07.000]   Isn't that interesting?
[01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:08.000]   Yeah, I think so.
[01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:09.000]   Yeah.
[01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:12.880]   So it looks like there's a pedestrian walkway that leads down to the where the circle and
[01:02:12.880 --> 01:02:14.640]   the box kind of join.
[01:02:14.640 --> 01:02:16.080]   And that's how people will enter.
[01:02:16.080 --> 01:02:19.880]   And you're right, Andy, it will be interesting to see once Apple has this facility, what they
[01:02:19.880 --> 01:02:24.880]   might use it for, not just events and not just company events and media events, but
[01:02:24.880 --> 01:02:28.800]   maybe they'll do other stuff since it's not in the campus building per se.
[01:02:28.800 --> 01:02:31.120]   It allows them to have different access for it too.
[01:02:31.120 --> 01:02:32.120]   It's pretty cool.
[01:02:32.120 --> 01:02:38.800]   They already have a lot of tourists coming to one infinite loop and famously there's
[01:02:38.800 --> 01:02:44.400]   like a shot clock somewhere in a desk behind the wall that if you take more than 23 seconds
[01:02:44.400 --> 01:02:48.920]   to take the photo, someone in a golf shirt will be out to ask you if you're done taking
[01:02:48.920 --> 01:02:49.920]   this.
[01:02:49.920 --> 01:02:56.160]   Okay, yes, it's happened to me, but it might even be part of the, they're loving your
[01:02:56.160 --> 01:02:57.160]   iPad.
[01:02:57.160 --> 01:02:59.160]   Well, no, it's a place of business.
[01:02:59.160 --> 01:03:02.280]   They don't like disruption, but if they know that people might be making a pilgrimage of
[01:03:02.280 --> 01:03:06.600]   the mothership anyway, they might have a situation in place where, okay, this is the public
[01:03:06.600 --> 01:03:09.240]   ish thing where people can't have access to it.
[01:03:09.240 --> 01:03:13.440]   And we will of course have a store next to it so the people can buy t-shirts and make
[01:03:13.440 --> 01:03:19.440]   sure they can get the iPhone 7L with the brand new square shape power connector that doesn't
[01:03:19.440 --> 01:03:23.040]   work with any current that Apple competitors provide.
[01:03:23.040 --> 01:03:27.080]   So if people are coming, they're going to show up at the door anyway, you may as well
[01:03:27.080 --> 01:03:30.720]   give them a reason to be satisfied that they got their selfie and they got their t-shirt
[01:03:30.720 --> 01:03:31.720]   and then leave.
[01:03:31.720 --> 01:03:36.280]   Like I said, just a lot of questions come up because this is just such a fascinating
[01:03:36.280 --> 01:03:42.920]   company to make a very fascinating piece of real estate and then all the different priorities
[01:03:42.920 --> 01:03:45.600]   that they would have that few other companies seem to have.
[01:03:45.600 --> 01:03:48.840]   I love this little archaeology on the MacRumors article.
[01:03:48.840 --> 01:03:52.720]   Google surpasses Apple as world's most valuable company by a Julie Clover.
[01:03:52.720 --> 01:03:57.720]   If you look at the URL, it was Google briefly surpasses Apple valuation.
[01:03:57.720 --> 01:04:00.280]   Yeah, because it went over and then back down.
[01:04:00.280 --> 01:04:04.720]   They removed the briefly because it was up 8% and after our trading, it looks like it
[01:04:04.720 --> 01:04:07.160]   didn't come be that brief.
[01:04:07.160 --> 01:04:08.160]   That's great.
[01:04:08.160 --> 01:04:09.800]   I love that.
[01:04:09.800 --> 01:04:13.240]   The CMSs don't want to change the URL.
[01:04:13.240 --> 01:04:14.800]   It's a Permalink.
[01:04:14.800 --> 01:04:20.920]   Sometimes history is in there.
[01:04:20.920 --> 01:04:24.040]   Apple is working on VR.
[01:04:24.040 --> 01:04:29.800]   Financial Times story, which is behind a paywall, of course, talks about their hiring.
[01:04:29.800 --> 01:04:34.600]   They've brought in some very big people.
[01:04:34.600 --> 01:04:41.680]   They bought fly by media and augmented reality startup that lets mobile devices see the world
[01:04:41.680 --> 01:04:42.680]   around them.
[01:04:42.680 --> 01:04:46.320]   This was stuff they did for Google with Project Tango.
[01:04:46.320 --> 01:04:50.640]   And Gene Munster, the analyst who's famous for being sure that Apple's going to release
[01:04:50.640 --> 01:04:58.760]   a TV set any day now, asked Tim Cook straight on on their analyst call about doing VR.
[01:04:58.760 --> 01:05:00.280]   And Tim Cook did not say no.
[01:05:00.280 --> 01:05:03.760]   And he did not say we do not comment on future products.
[01:05:03.760 --> 01:05:05.240]   He said, I don't think it's a fat.
[01:05:05.240 --> 01:05:06.240]   I think it's really interesting.
[01:05:06.240 --> 01:05:10.000]   And there's a lot of interesting things to be seen in VR and just kind of moved on.
[01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:14.840]   So that is as close to a we're looking into it as you're ever going to get from Apple.
[01:05:14.840 --> 01:05:18.000]   It was a very Apple watch sort of response, wasn't it?
[01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:20.040]   The wrist is a place of interest.
[01:05:20.040 --> 01:05:21.040]   Yes.
[01:05:21.040 --> 01:05:22.040]   Okay.
[01:05:22.040 --> 01:05:28.280]   They hired Doug Bowman, who's a hot shot in VR.
[01:05:28.280 --> 01:05:31.600]   This is, of course, as we mentioned, if you're looking for growth, you have to look for
[01:05:31.600 --> 01:05:36.320]   new markets and really in a way they're a little behind on this game.
[01:05:36.320 --> 01:05:37.320]   But we don't know how far.
[01:05:37.320 --> 01:05:39.960]   Well, this is also different because VR may not end up being a product, but it could
[01:05:39.960 --> 01:05:42.320]   end up being a technology we see in many, many different products.
[01:05:42.320 --> 01:05:44.080]   It's sort of, you know, like displays.
[01:05:44.080 --> 01:05:46.640]   Like, you think it's going to be displays on a lot of different things.
[01:05:46.640 --> 01:05:51.440]   And everything from augmented reality and heads up to actual virtual reality for interfaces.
[01:05:51.440 --> 01:05:56.000]   Because I believe Bowman is also an inner, a 3D interface guru.
[01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:57.960]   So there's a whole bunch of potential applications.
[01:05:57.960 --> 01:06:02.120]   Whether Apple makes like a view master that you can click through, you know, maybe, maybe
[01:06:02.120 --> 01:06:05.760]   not, but this technology is just going to, it's going to be throughout Apple's products
[01:06:05.760 --> 01:06:08.000]   for the next 20 years or so.
[01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:10.320]   I love by the way, go ahead.
[01:06:10.320 --> 01:06:15.040]   I wonder if Apple is going to have some problems getting the top people though, because first
[01:06:15.040 --> 01:06:17.320]   of all, we've all heard about magic leap.
[01:06:17.320 --> 01:06:22.520]   This start up that I think it just got another, what, another 600 million in funding on top
[01:06:22.520 --> 01:06:27.000]   of the 1.2 or 1.3 they've already gotten in previous rounds.
[01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:30.440]   And they're obviously have nothing to show yet, but they have shown people their technology
[01:06:30.440 --> 01:06:33.040]   and they've released some videos of what they're doing.
[01:06:33.040 --> 01:06:38.480]   It must be, I imagine there's so much competition for the top people in this technology.
[01:06:38.480 --> 01:06:44.160]   And I imagine that if Google or Facebook or someone else says that we will be a public
[01:06:44.160 --> 01:06:48.920]   face of this product, your team will be able to show off works in progress, as opposed
[01:06:48.920 --> 01:06:53.560]   to once again being part of a Soviet moonshot program where you are hired, you're not allowed
[01:06:53.560 --> 01:06:56.480]   to put on LinkedIn what you're doing.
[01:06:56.480 --> 01:06:59.680]   And in three years when we decide that we don't want to pursue this, no one will ever
[01:06:59.680 --> 01:07:04.400]   see any of the work that you've ever done and you'll be sworn to sequence secrecy in
[01:07:04.400 --> 01:07:06.280]   a highly competitive environment.
[01:07:06.280 --> 01:07:09.280]   There are a lot of people who take a lot of jobs for a lot of reasons, not just prestige,
[01:07:09.280 --> 01:07:10.400]   not just money.
[01:07:10.400 --> 01:07:18.640]   I wonder if the secrecy behind any Apple project might make it a harder pitch under certain circumstances.
[01:07:18.640 --> 01:07:22.880]   I love Dave Wiskus's article on I'm more Renee.
[01:07:22.880 --> 01:07:25.680]   Music memos is a songwriter's best friend.
[01:07:25.680 --> 01:07:31.080]   When you look at this new program that Apple put out for the iPhone, it looks very simple.
[01:07:31.080 --> 01:07:37.400]   It's like voice memos, a way to record kind of music and then add some simple backing music
[01:07:37.400 --> 01:07:41.520]   just as a way of jotting down notes, much as you would with the voice memo.
[01:07:41.520 --> 01:07:43.840]   But he can't, I mean, there's a lot of stuff in here.
[01:07:43.840 --> 01:07:46.880]   It's actually quite a deep, surprisingly a deep app.
[01:07:46.880 --> 01:07:50.080]   Well, it turns out like Dave, like a lot of artists like Taylor Swift has talked about
[01:07:50.080 --> 01:07:53.240]   this and many other famous artists were just using voice memos on their phone as a way to
[01:07:53.240 --> 01:07:57.080]   record ideas because if you don't, that idea has just gone forever.
[01:07:57.080 --> 01:08:00.000]   But there was almost like a, it got stuck in there and they couldn't really do anything
[01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:01.680]   with it so it wasn't ideal.
[01:08:01.680 --> 01:08:05.280]   And I love that Apple, whether you look at iMovie or you look at the Apple Pencil, you
[01:08:05.280 --> 01:08:10.600]   look at music memos, they're doing these things that sort of help you make that leap in creativity
[01:08:10.600 --> 01:08:13.600]   where you have something that's sort of kind of creative but you add this accelerator to
[01:08:13.600 --> 01:08:14.600]   it.
[01:08:14.600 --> 01:08:17.600]   And then suddenly you're putting your ideas in there, you can try some sample backing
[01:08:17.600 --> 01:08:18.600]   tracks.
[01:08:18.600 --> 01:08:22.920]   But it's really easy to get that into GarageBand later and turn into actual music.
[01:08:22.920 --> 01:08:26.960]   And Dave's part of a band called Airplane Mode and he works with, Dave is a well-known
[01:08:26.960 --> 01:08:31.640]   Apple community designer and he works with another designer, Joe Chablinsky, in a band
[01:08:31.640 --> 01:08:35.680]   called Airplane Mode and they have drummers and they have a keyboard player and they sort
[01:08:35.680 --> 01:08:39.360]   of use all this Apple technology towards making music.
[01:08:39.360 --> 01:08:42.640]   And I think that's sort of, when you talk about what's in Apple's DNA, they've always had
[01:08:42.640 --> 01:08:44.760]   this strong creative force in them.
[01:08:44.760 --> 01:08:49.480]   So some people said, "Oh, it's creation only almost as a way of knocking Apple aside."
[01:08:49.480 --> 01:08:53.720]   But then you look at the way they've made this stuff accessible and just approachable
[01:08:53.720 --> 01:08:58.080]   to so many people and doing it this way just with your iPhone in a car or a subway or anywhere
[01:08:58.080 --> 01:08:59.720]   makes all that music more approachable.
[01:08:59.720 --> 01:09:03.720]   I think that's the sort of stuff that they do really, really well.
[01:09:03.720 --> 01:09:06.360]   And of course it ties in nicely to the new GarageBand.
[01:09:06.360 --> 01:09:11.480]   So that's, boy, if you have an iPad Pro, this is suddenly a very interesting device for
[01:09:11.480 --> 01:09:12.480]   that.
[01:09:12.480 --> 01:09:14.600]   So we were talking about YouTube videos.
[01:09:14.600 --> 01:09:16.400]   Somebody in the chatroom passed along this link.
[01:09:16.400 --> 01:09:20.560]   They have found what was long thought to be lost.
[01:09:20.560 --> 01:09:22.960]   Steve Jobs at the next introduction.
[01:09:22.960 --> 01:09:26.800]   And I think it's timely that this was released because of course this was one of the three
[01:09:26.800 --> 01:09:30.400]   introductions dramatized in the Air and Circum Flop.
[01:09:30.400 --> 01:09:32.120]   Like saying that.
[01:09:32.120 --> 01:09:33.120]   Flop.
[01:09:33.120 --> 01:09:34.120]   Steve Jobs.
[01:09:34.120 --> 01:09:35.120]   Oscar nominated.
[01:09:35.120 --> 01:09:37.320]   Oscar nominated Flop.
[01:09:37.320 --> 01:09:42.760]   But so now if you wanted what it was actually like, this, you know, the stories of this are
[01:09:42.760 --> 01:09:43.840]   kind of legendary.
[01:09:43.840 --> 01:09:48.400]   There was a long symphonic interlude apparently and all sorts of stuff.
[01:09:48.400 --> 01:09:50.800]   So there is a video now and it's on YouTube.
[01:09:50.800 --> 01:09:53.760]   It's not a great quality video.
[01:09:53.760 --> 01:09:54.760]   It's a leader in educational community.
[01:09:54.760 --> 01:09:56.560]   As you can hear the audio is a special step.
[01:09:56.560 --> 01:09:57.960]   It's from VHS tape.
[01:09:57.960 --> 01:09:59.440]   There's time going on.
[01:09:59.440 --> 01:10:03.520]   There's schools like Bassert and Reed as well as state universities from California to
[01:10:03.520 --> 01:10:04.520]   Michigan to Maryland.
[01:10:04.520 --> 01:10:06.520]   They could have gotten rid of that left channel.
[01:10:06.520 --> 01:10:08.520]   For the listening presentations.
[01:10:08.520 --> 01:10:10.840]   For a list of their dreams.
[01:10:10.840 --> 01:10:12.760]   Time.
[01:10:12.760 --> 01:10:16.920]   This looks like, I can't tell if it was a fan shot.
[01:10:16.920 --> 01:10:18.640]   No, wait.
[01:10:18.640 --> 01:10:20.920]   Can you whistle Steve?
[01:10:20.920 --> 01:10:22.920]   Yeah.
[01:10:22.920 --> 01:10:24.320]   Before there was music memos.
[01:10:24.320 --> 01:10:25.320]   Yeah.
[01:10:25.320 --> 01:10:26.920]   It was a 3D watch.
[01:10:26.920 --> 01:10:28.400]   It was this.
[01:10:28.400 --> 01:10:34.680]   On the right is a 4A analyzer, a spectroscope, a spectrum analyzer, or making spectrograms rather.
[01:10:34.680 --> 01:10:38.800]   And sure enough, I also have a log scale for it.
[01:10:38.800 --> 01:10:39.800]   Is that my--
[01:10:39.800 --> 01:10:42.200]   It's kind of a machine that can compute those logs all the way across the screen and real
[01:10:42.200 --> 01:10:43.200]   time.
[01:10:43.200 --> 01:10:44.760]   Laptop or is it on the actual video?
[01:10:44.760 --> 01:10:48.200]   Somebody in the chat room says you can hear him talking backstage during parts of it.
[01:10:48.200 --> 01:10:49.600]   And you can see spikes from frequency.
[01:10:49.600 --> 01:10:51.160]   So this can--
[01:10:51.160 --> 01:10:52.160]   So this is the--
[01:10:52.160 --> 01:10:56.640]   And the entire next step platform demo of the next cube.
[01:10:56.640 --> 01:11:00.120]   Yeah, this is clearly a fan shot.
[01:11:00.120 --> 01:11:02.920]   The optical disk actually spins at I believe 3000 RPM--
[01:11:02.920 --> 01:11:04.360]   Steve looks sharp in a black suit.
[01:11:04.360 --> 01:11:05.360]   I think she has stuck with that look.
[01:11:05.360 --> 01:11:08.640]   I think it's a transgrade without a megabyte per second.
[01:11:08.640 --> 01:11:09.800]   Megabyte per second.
[01:11:09.800 --> 01:11:11.760]   That's not possible.
[01:11:11.760 --> 01:11:13.760]   How could it do so much?
[01:11:13.760 --> 01:11:15.160]   Magic, I tell you.
[01:11:15.160 --> 01:11:16.160]   Magic.
[01:11:16.160 --> 01:11:17.160]   This is what--
[01:11:17.160 --> 01:11:21.800]   Next was just such a truly innovative spectacular machine.
[01:11:21.800 --> 01:11:22.800]   It was a failure.
[01:11:22.800 --> 01:11:23.800]   Oh, it's really easy.
[01:11:23.800 --> 01:11:29.160]   But every single thing in this machine turned out to be both derided and bizarre, but defined
[01:11:29.160 --> 01:11:31.040]   computing for the next 10 years.
[01:11:31.040 --> 01:11:32.040]   This is just--
[01:11:32.040 --> 01:11:33.040]   Well, and let's not--
[01:11:33.040 --> 01:11:34.040]   I respect for it to maintain it.
[01:11:34.040 --> 01:11:37.640]   It may be a flop, but let's not forget what was done with it, including the invention
[01:11:37.640 --> 01:11:41.560]   of the World Wide Web Early Pixar rendering a lot of--
[01:11:41.560 --> 01:11:44.400]   And if you've bought a Mac in the last 16 years--
[01:11:44.400 --> 01:11:45.400]   You're using next step.
[01:11:45.400 --> 01:11:47.240]   --you are running next step underneath it.
[01:11:47.240 --> 01:11:48.240]   Yeah.
[01:11:48.240 --> 01:11:55.280]   So that really glad that whoever found this in his attic or her attic, this VHS source,
[01:11:55.280 --> 01:11:57.080]   it says that 41 minutes--
[01:11:57.080 --> 01:11:58.080]   Oh, wait a minute.
[01:11:58.080 --> 01:11:59.080]   Let's see if we can find this.
[01:11:59.080 --> 01:12:02.560]   The 41 minutes Steve speaks from backstage.
[01:12:02.560 --> 01:12:06.080]   I'm going to see if I can find this actual moment here.
[01:12:06.080 --> 01:12:08.920]   [VIDEO PLAYBACK]
[01:12:08.920 --> 01:12:10.760]   [END PLAYBACK]

[01:12:15.040 --> 01:12:16.400]   He's whispering.
[01:12:16.400 --> 01:12:17.400]   [LAUGHTER]

[01:12:23.480 --> 01:12:24.480]   [END PLAYBACK]
[01:12:24.480 --> 01:12:26.080]   Come on, damn it.
[01:12:26.080 --> 01:12:27.240]   It's not working.
[01:12:27.240 --> 01:12:30.120]   And you know what the audience is going to, I think?
[01:12:30.120 --> 01:12:35.280]   Anyway, that's on YouTube in the rediscovered future channel.
[01:12:35.280 --> 01:12:37.600]   Weirdly enough, only 1,000 people have watched it so far.
[01:12:37.600 --> 01:12:41.040]   I think that number probably will go up as people discover it.
[01:12:41.040 --> 01:12:48.240]   Has anybody ever thought about taking--
[01:12:48.240 --> 01:12:53.400]   if the Steve Jobs movie is on video yet, basically take it shot by shot
[01:12:53.400 --> 01:12:56.920]   and just replace it with actual archival, basically take the same
[01:12:56.920 --> 01:12:58.880]   sequence of story beats.
[01:12:58.880 --> 01:13:00.240]   But it's nothing from the movie.
[01:13:00.240 --> 01:13:02.760]   It's just from this actual video of the actual product
[01:13:02.760 --> 01:13:05.760]   rollouts of actual interviews that people have given.
[01:13:05.760 --> 01:13:08.000]   I bet you can actually do a pretty good version of that.
[01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:11.120]   That would be very interesting.
[01:13:11.120 --> 01:13:16.360]   According to rumors, iPhone 7 or maybe iPhone 8
[01:13:16.360 --> 01:13:19.680]   will have wireless charging according to a Bloomberg report.
[01:13:19.680 --> 01:13:21.640]   It's more than that, though, which is really interesting
[01:13:21.640 --> 01:13:23.840]   about this, because what we normally call wireless charging
[01:13:23.840 --> 01:13:25.040]   is actually inductive charging.
[01:13:25.040 --> 01:13:27.080]   So you've got to put a magnet on the back of it.
[01:13:27.080 --> 01:13:28.200]   And that's not really wireless.
[01:13:28.200 --> 01:13:30.400]   It's sort of like how the MagSafe has always worked
[01:13:30.400 --> 01:13:31.400]   or the Apple Watch.
[01:13:31.400 --> 01:13:33.240]   You're still sticking two things together.
[01:13:33.240 --> 01:13:36.080]   This is resonance, so it can be a distance away.
[01:13:36.080 --> 01:13:40.120]   How far away physics, science, because it loses power
[01:13:40.120 --> 01:13:40.960]   the greater the distance.
[01:13:40.960 --> 01:13:42.800]   But the idea here is that you wouldn't even
[01:13:42.800 --> 01:13:44.920]   need to put it on a little magnetic puck.
[01:13:44.920 --> 01:13:46.800]   You could actually just put it near something
[01:13:46.800 --> 01:13:48.680]   and it would charge.
[01:13:48.680 --> 01:13:52.480]   Yeah, I don't know if it'll be available in 2017.
[01:13:52.480 --> 01:13:56.480]   Well, also the deal, I've always thought that--
[01:13:56.480 --> 01:13:58.720]   every time that I would praise certain Android phones
[01:13:58.720 --> 01:14:05.640]   for having wireless contact, no pluggy any charging, let's say.
[01:14:05.640 --> 01:14:09.240]   Because I had charging pads on my desk
[01:14:09.240 --> 01:14:11.040]   and everywhere I would drop my phone was just great.
[01:14:11.040 --> 01:14:13.000]   But then at the same time, you have to say, yeah.
[01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:17.120]   But Apple iPhones don't need wireless charging
[01:14:17.120 --> 01:14:20.280]   because they have batteries that will last a day and a half.
[01:14:20.280 --> 01:14:21.280]   That's the great experience.
[01:14:21.280 --> 01:14:24.480]   That will last until you go to bed and plug it in.
[01:14:24.480 --> 01:14:27.880]   So I don't know if this is a--
[01:14:27.880 --> 01:14:30.120]   I would love to see them do something
[01:14:30.120 --> 01:14:33.160]   with wireless charging that does something more than simply
[01:14:33.160 --> 01:14:34.520]   charge the battery.
[01:14:34.520 --> 01:14:36.960]   But it's an interesting idea.
[01:14:36.960 --> 01:14:37.600]   There was--
[01:14:37.600 --> 01:14:41.280]   I had a palm pre-minus that had inductive charging back in 2009.
[01:14:41.280 --> 01:14:42.520]   I know, and I love this.
[01:14:42.520 --> 01:14:44.200]   Unductive charging is great.
[01:14:44.200 --> 01:14:47.120]   Apple has a hard time with that because they have metal phones,
[01:14:47.120 --> 01:14:48.240]   and so that makes it difficult.
[01:14:48.240 --> 01:14:50.520]   Well, you couldn't do it with metal until Qualcomm
[01:14:50.520 --> 01:14:52.520]   put out the first technology for metal through.
[01:14:52.520 --> 01:14:54.680]   Because basically, you wanted to go through the plastic
[01:14:54.680 --> 01:14:56.320]   to hit the metal, and that's what would make the charge.
[01:14:56.320 --> 01:14:57.280]   And you put metal in the way.
[01:14:57.280 --> 01:14:58.840]   It's going to dissipate into the casing.
[01:14:58.840 --> 01:15:02.880]   So they've made aluminum transparent wireless charging now.
[01:15:02.880 --> 01:15:07.720]   This technology has been treated with some skepticism
[01:15:07.720 --> 01:15:12.120]   before U-beam is the company that's--
[01:15:12.120 --> 01:15:14.960]   it's kind of the Theranos, Theranos for charging,
[01:15:14.960 --> 01:15:19.320]   where they have secret supersonic technology that
[01:15:19.320 --> 01:15:23.400]   vibrates the air so fast you can't hear it or feel it.
[01:15:23.400 --> 01:15:25.160]   In other words, it's ultrasonic.
[01:15:25.160 --> 01:15:28.560]   And it goes across the room, but your phone can feel it.
[01:15:28.560 --> 01:15:34.000]   And it magically charges things in the air.
[01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:36.800]   A number of physicists--
[01:15:36.800 --> 01:15:38.880]   You know, skeptical, shall we say?
[01:15:38.880 --> 01:15:41.720]   There's a-- there's on the list of miracles
[01:15:41.720 --> 01:15:45.440]   that Tesla invented that evil Thomas Edison prevented
[01:15:45.440 --> 01:15:47.240]   from happening where, yes, imagining no one
[01:15:47.240 --> 01:15:49.840]   have to have to pay for power because we put this tower
[01:15:49.840 --> 01:15:51.680]   in the air that broadcasts electricity.
[01:15:51.680 --> 01:15:54.400]   And then you ask a physicist, he said, that's fine.
[01:15:54.400 --> 01:15:56.800]   And the other benefit is that you could simply go for a walk
[01:15:56.800 --> 01:16:00.560]   and pick up beautifully roasted birds off of the road
[01:16:00.560 --> 01:16:01.280]   and forget where--
[01:16:01.280 --> 01:16:03.560]   That was the joke at CES that you would just put a marshmallow
[01:16:03.560 --> 01:16:05.840]   in between the phone and the charger.
[01:16:05.840 --> 01:16:08.200]   Yeah.
[01:16:08.200 --> 01:16:12.160]   A lot of money, $23.4 million in investment money
[01:16:12.160 --> 01:16:14.200]   from Andries and Horowitz, Founders Fund,
[01:16:14.200 --> 01:16:15.560]   Marissa Meyer, Mark Cuban.
[01:16:15.560 --> 01:16:17.440]   The biggest problem right now is just the efficiency.
[01:16:17.440 --> 01:16:18.360]   Like, they've gotten wireless.
[01:16:18.360 --> 01:16:20.360]   I think the Palm pre had 50% efficiency,
[01:16:20.360 --> 01:16:23.080]   and they've gotten up to 90% in recent Android devices.
[01:16:23.080 --> 01:16:24.400]   But when you start doing an air gap,
[01:16:24.400 --> 01:16:27.880]   that efficiency just drops off a shelf the further you go away.
[01:16:27.880 --> 01:16:28.400]   Yeah.
[01:16:28.400 --> 01:16:29.880]   And are people going to tolerate having--
[01:16:29.880 --> 01:16:31.480]   yes, it's charging, but it also means
[01:16:31.480 --> 01:16:33.920]   that I can't keep the screen lit, or I can't be listening
[01:16:33.920 --> 01:16:35.600]   to music while it's going because, again,
[01:16:35.600 --> 01:16:37.960]   unless you have it lined up particularly well.
[01:16:37.960 --> 01:16:40.560]   I mean, it's not a big hassle to--
[01:16:40.560 --> 01:16:42.960]   there's some magnetic coupling style chargers,
[01:16:42.960 --> 01:16:44.120]   but most of them are just--
[01:16:44.120 --> 01:16:46.600]   it is just simply a nice little piece of leather
[01:16:46.600 --> 01:16:48.200]   that you put your--
[01:16:48.200 --> 01:16:49.160]   it's like a barco suit.
[01:16:49.160 --> 01:16:51.080]   You just simply rest the thing on.
[01:16:51.080 --> 01:16:53.440]   And then it's half of a millimeter away
[01:16:53.440 --> 01:16:54.440]   from the charging thing.
[01:16:54.440 --> 01:16:57.160]   And you get-- it can charge and let you
[01:16:57.160 --> 01:16:58.600]   use the thing at the same time.
[01:16:58.600 --> 01:17:03.440]   People, Apple particularly, seems to try away from solutions
[01:17:03.440 --> 01:17:05.680]   that solve one interesting problem,
[01:17:05.680 --> 01:17:08.280]   but create another problem conceptually
[01:17:08.280 --> 01:17:10.880]   while solving that problem.
[01:17:10.880 --> 01:17:16.320]   They, you beam hopes to charge devices with 1 and 1/2,
[01:17:16.320 --> 01:17:19.040]   as much as or a minimum of, they say, 1 and 1/2 watts
[01:17:19.040 --> 01:17:24.480]   of electricity, up to 4 meters from the transmitter.
[01:17:24.480 --> 01:17:27.880]   But it's not that scientists say things like, well,
[01:17:27.880 --> 01:17:29.080]   it's possible.
[01:17:29.080 --> 01:17:30.560]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:17:30.560 --> 01:17:32.520]   Yeah, I mean--
[01:17:32.520 --> 01:17:34.400]   The interesting thing with Apple is when they did wireless
[01:17:34.400 --> 01:17:35.680]   charging with the Apple phone--
[01:17:35.680 --> 01:17:37.280]   sorry, with the Apple Watch, they set it
[01:17:37.280 --> 01:17:38.480]   for very specific reasons.
[01:17:38.480 --> 01:17:40.400]   It was because they anticipated you would either
[01:17:40.400 --> 01:17:42.160]   be going to bed or waking up from bed
[01:17:42.160 --> 01:17:44.040]   and trying to take off or put on your watch.
[01:17:44.040 --> 01:17:46.040]   And they didn't want you to be tired and bleary-eyed
[01:17:46.040 --> 01:17:47.920]   and try to fuss with what is really
[01:17:47.920 --> 01:17:50.600]   a tiny, tiny variant of a lightning connector on the Apple
[01:17:50.600 --> 01:17:51.100]   Watch.
[01:17:51.100 --> 01:17:52.120]   It's all sealed away.
[01:17:52.120 --> 01:17:54.720]   They thought it'd be easier just to almost like the MagSafe
[01:17:54.720 --> 01:17:56.280]   just line it up and slide the line.
[01:17:56.280 --> 01:17:56.720]   I kind of like it.
[01:17:56.720 --> 01:17:57.600]   I've gotten used to it.
[01:17:57.600 --> 01:17:58.440]   I like it.
[01:17:58.440 --> 01:17:59.840]   At least you know because it goes,
[01:17:59.840 --> 01:18:01.560]   Thwock and the phone.
[01:18:01.560 --> 01:18:02.640]   And they watch lights up.
[01:18:02.640 --> 01:18:03.760]   You know that it's doing it.
[01:18:03.760 --> 01:18:04.200]   And I think that's--
[01:18:04.200 --> 01:18:06.320]   Although last night I did that, I was so happy I went to bed.
[01:18:06.320 --> 01:18:08.080]   I woke up and my Apple Watch was dead because the other end
[01:18:08.080 --> 01:18:09.560]   wasn't plugged in.
[01:18:09.560 --> 01:18:11.760]   It still flocks.
[01:18:11.760 --> 01:18:12.160]   Yep.
[01:18:12.160 --> 01:18:14.440]   I think I got to work on that.
[01:18:14.440 --> 01:18:17.560]   I will say that I would love to see a new charger that
[01:18:17.560 --> 01:18:19.160]   doesn't have a magnet in it.
[01:18:19.160 --> 01:18:21.520]   One of the things I really like about the Moto 360
[01:18:21.520 --> 01:18:25.120]   is that it's wireless charging, but it's just
[01:18:25.120 --> 01:18:30.760]   a simple stand that turns your watch into like a bedside clock.
[01:18:30.760 --> 01:18:32.960]   And it's just the difference between all you've got to do
[01:18:32.960 --> 01:18:35.320]   is drop it into this nice little stand and it charges,
[01:18:35.320 --> 01:18:39.080]   as opposed to fishing out the end of this and clicking it on
[01:18:39.080 --> 01:18:41.760]   and then waiting to see if the little charging thing comes on,
[01:18:41.760 --> 01:18:43.480]   which I got to do every single time.
[01:18:43.480 --> 01:18:44.240]   I'm sorry.
[01:18:44.240 --> 01:18:45.560]   The watch doesn't make me do it, but I'm
[01:18:45.560 --> 01:18:47.880]   saying that mentally I got to do that.
[01:18:47.880 --> 01:18:49.960]   There are nice little stands that also work well,
[01:18:49.960 --> 01:18:51.560]   but it's different when you're just--
[01:18:51.560 --> 01:18:55.080]   It's not just throw it on the nightstand and it works,
[01:18:55.080 --> 01:18:58.240]   which is just a simple conceptual break.
[01:18:58.240 --> 01:19:00.320]   But given the choice between the two,
[01:19:00.320 --> 01:19:04.920]   I just dropped it on the nightstand and it works.
[01:19:04.920 --> 01:19:06.560]   But when I travel, I even have those--
[01:19:06.560 --> 01:19:09.440]   it's because it works with Qi charging.
[01:19:09.440 --> 01:19:12.800]   I actually have a couple of little tiny pads where it literally
[01:19:12.800 --> 01:19:16.680]   is just drop it on this little bar coaster and it charges.
[01:19:16.680 --> 01:19:18.800]   It's given that that's what I do with my watch
[01:19:18.800 --> 01:19:22.000]   every single night, whether it's a smartwatch or not.
[01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:23.880]   It's a nice little addition.
[01:19:23.880 --> 01:19:26.480]   Last week we talked about Crash Safari.com.
[01:19:26.480 --> 01:19:28.320]   Apple, I'm told, fixed it.
[01:19:28.320 --> 01:19:29.400]   Should we try it?
[01:19:29.400 --> 01:19:29.900]   Sure.
[01:19:29.900 --> 01:19:30.640]   They pushed out a fix.
[01:19:30.640 --> 01:19:31.640]   It's a silly bug.
[01:19:31.640 --> 01:19:32.640]   We talked about it on a security now.
[01:19:32.640 --> 01:19:34.280]   You're trying Safari, though.
[01:19:34.280 --> 01:19:36.160]   Oh, I'm in Chrome.
[01:19:36.160 --> 01:19:39.800]   Well, it crashed Chrome too.
[01:19:39.800 --> 01:19:41.480]   Because what it is, it overloads.
[01:19:41.480 --> 01:19:43.840]   Yes, so Chrome is not fixed.
[01:19:43.840 --> 01:19:44.560]   That's good news.
[01:19:44.560 --> 01:19:45.600]   Let's try Safari.
[01:19:45.600 --> 01:19:52.280]   Chrome is sitting there with a white screen.
[01:19:52.280 --> 01:19:57.640]   C-R-A-S-H-S-A-F-A-R-I.com.
[01:19:57.640 --> 01:19:59.560]   Let's see if Safari is fixed.
[01:19:59.560 --> 01:20:02.680]   Actually, it's good to try it in Chrome first to see.
[01:20:02.680 --> 01:20:06.280]   Actually, maybe the Crash Safari site is down,
[01:20:06.280 --> 01:20:08.960]   because it's not coming up.
[01:20:08.960 --> 01:20:11.920]   Well, that's one way to fix it.
[01:20:11.920 --> 01:20:13.680]   It was funny.
[01:20:13.680 --> 01:20:15.680]   It was like four lines of JavaScript code
[01:20:15.680 --> 01:20:18.920]   is the simplest thing in the world.
[01:20:18.920 --> 01:20:20.200]   It's just kind of an infinite loop.
[01:20:20.200 --> 01:20:22.760]   Yeah, my Chrome seems to really--
[01:20:22.760 --> 01:20:26.280]   Yeah, your fan just came on your laptop too.
[01:20:26.280 --> 01:20:28.200]   Meanwhile, Safari is just saying what?
[01:20:28.200 --> 01:20:29.640]   Wonder if they've got a--
[01:20:29.640 --> 01:20:31.200]   Just blocked it?
[01:20:31.200 --> 01:20:35.280]   Yeah, like on their malware, white or black list kind of thing,
[01:20:35.280 --> 01:20:37.120]   if they just blocked it.
[01:20:37.120 --> 01:20:39.640]   Google's fixed it in the Canary channel, I'm told.
[01:20:39.640 --> 01:20:42.760]   But that's a ways off.
[01:20:42.760 --> 01:20:49.000]   Usually, you can see the URL it's going to is now being populated.
[01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:50.200]   Come on, let's close this.
[01:20:50.200 --> 01:20:52.240]   I think I can close this tab.
[01:20:52.240 --> 01:20:53.240]   Close tab.
[01:20:53.240 --> 01:21:00.040]   Yeah, Chrome is really unhappy.
[01:21:00.040 --> 01:21:02.720]   Well, we'll be back after I reboot my computer.
[01:21:02.720 --> 01:21:04.760]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:21:04.760 --> 01:21:06.080]   Wow, I really--
[01:21:06.080 --> 01:21:07.880]   All right, well, the last time when I did this,
[01:21:07.880 --> 01:21:09.360]   I just forced Quick Chrome.
[01:21:09.360 --> 01:21:10.640]   It's for the readers, Leo.
[01:21:10.640 --> 01:21:12.080]   I do it for you.
[01:21:12.080 --> 01:21:13.080]   So you don't have to--
[01:21:13.080 --> 01:21:14.080]   It's for the viewers.
[01:21:14.080 --> 01:21:15.080]   It's right.
[01:21:15.080 --> 01:21:16.080]   You don't have to try this stuff.
[01:21:16.080 --> 01:21:17.080]   You've crashed for all of us.
[01:21:17.080 --> 01:21:18.080]   Yeah.
[01:21:18.080 --> 01:21:19.080]   It's good to have a product that does what it says on the side
[01:21:19.080 --> 01:21:20.880]   of the package.
[01:21:20.880 --> 01:21:24.480]   In this case, Crash Safari or Chrome.
[01:21:24.480 --> 01:21:25.480]   Actually, any browser.
[01:21:25.480 --> 01:21:28.320]   I think Internet Explorer also has crashed Firefox.
[01:21:28.320 --> 01:21:30.280]   I think was immune.
[01:21:30.280 --> 01:21:32.480]   And Safari still hasn't loaded it,
[01:21:32.480 --> 01:21:34.000]   so that's interesting.
[01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:35.360]   Well, but it's spinning, right?
[01:21:35.360 --> 01:21:35.880]   So--
[01:21:35.880 --> 01:21:36.960]   You think it actually loaded it and crashed?
[01:21:36.960 --> 01:21:38.800]   I think maybe it did.
[01:21:38.800 --> 01:21:39.320]   All right.
[01:21:39.320 --> 01:21:40.000]   Yeah, it's not.
[01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:41.040]   I can't crash Safari.
[01:21:41.040 --> 01:21:43.120]   I mean, I can't close Safari.
[01:21:43.120 --> 01:21:45.480]   So OK, don't do this at home, kids.
[01:21:45.480 --> 01:21:47.000]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:48.320]   Yeah, application not responding.
[01:21:48.320 --> 01:21:49.640]   So it still crashes Safari.
[01:21:49.640 --> 01:21:50.640]   Here's the good news.
[01:21:50.640 --> 01:21:56.040]   And meanwhile, we're going to take a break
[01:21:56.040 --> 01:21:58.160]   and get your picks of the week.
[01:21:58.160 --> 01:21:59.600]   I bought that LoomCUBANDI.
[01:21:59.600 --> 01:22:01.200]   Love it.
[01:22:01.200 --> 01:22:02.000]   Yep.
[01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:02.600]   Love it.
[01:22:02.600 --> 01:22:05.480]   Last week's pick from Mr. Nodko.
[01:22:05.480 --> 01:22:11.480]   In fact, I bought everything from last week.
[01:22:11.480 --> 01:22:14.000]   I got the mixer that Alex Lindsey recommended.
[01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:15.400]   Love it.
[01:22:15.400 --> 01:22:16.680]   What did you recommend last week?
[01:22:16.680 --> 01:22:18.760]   I can't remember Renee.
[01:22:18.760 --> 01:22:20.000]   Oh, I don't remember either.
[01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:20.280]   Well--
[01:22:20.280 --> 01:22:21.320]   Must have been a cheap app.
[01:22:21.320 --> 01:22:22.080]   I hope it was.
[01:22:22.080 --> 01:22:23.200]   Probably.
[01:22:23.200 --> 01:22:24.040]   Oh, yeah, it was.
[01:22:24.040 --> 01:22:26.800]   It was the app that let you schedule habits.
[01:22:26.800 --> 01:22:27.800]   Oh, yeah, yeah.
[01:22:27.800 --> 01:22:28.300]   Love it.
[01:22:28.300 --> 01:22:28.800]   Streak.
[01:22:28.800 --> 01:22:29.300]   Streak.
[01:22:29.300 --> 01:22:31.120]   I've been using it.
[01:22:31.120 --> 01:22:32.840]   Set up the habits on my watch.
[01:22:32.840 --> 01:22:35.600]   It's very annoying, but it's good.
[01:22:35.600 --> 01:22:36.480]   It's no, it's good.
[01:22:36.480 --> 01:22:38.760]   It actually got me exercising and eating a good game.
[01:22:38.760 --> 01:22:41.160]   It's annoying in the sense that your mom can be annoying,
[01:22:41.160 --> 01:22:42.360]   but not sure you get to school.
[01:22:42.360 --> 01:22:42.840]   Nudge.
[01:22:42.840 --> 01:22:43.200]   That's right.
[01:22:43.200 --> 01:22:46.320]   We call it your homework done.
[01:22:46.320 --> 01:22:48.280]   So I'm waiting to hear what you all have to recommend.
[01:22:48.280 --> 01:22:50.320]   And let's see if Leo buys everything
[01:22:50.320 --> 01:22:53.360]   that the panel recommends this week.
[01:22:53.360 --> 01:22:55.400]   That'll be the first.
[01:22:55.400 --> 01:23:00.520]   But our show today brought to you by LegalZoom.com.
[01:23:00.520 --> 01:23:04.400]   LegalZoom is a great service, which we are actually using.
[01:23:04.400 --> 01:23:06.120]   We've used it to set up Twitch.
[01:23:06.120 --> 01:23:10.080]   And we're setting up a new agency to sell ads for Twitch.
[01:23:10.080 --> 01:23:12.160]   And LegalZoom.com was right there.
[01:23:12.160 --> 01:23:15.640]   Made it so easy to get that LLC.
[01:23:15.640 --> 01:23:19.360]   Before another year passes, time to get your life organized.
[01:23:19.360 --> 01:23:21.560]   There's lots of things you want to do,
[01:23:21.560 --> 01:23:25.360]   like perhaps make a will or a trust, incorporate,
[01:23:25.360 --> 01:23:28.000]   get a trademark, all of those things.
[01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:30.680]   People put off because they think, well, I'm a guy.
[01:23:30.680 --> 01:23:31.880]   I'm going to go a lawyer.
[01:23:31.880 --> 01:23:32.960]   I've got to spend a lot of money.
[01:23:32.960 --> 01:23:34.640]   I'm going to just take a lot of time.
[01:23:34.640 --> 01:23:36.560]   LegalZoom cuts through it all.
[01:23:36.560 --> 01:23:40.000]   There's-- turns out there's lots of stuff you can do.
[01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:43.000]   Without a lawyer, with the help of LegalZoom,
[01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:47.680]   see LegalZoom's not a law firm, they help you do the work you
[01:23:47.680 --> 01:23:48.200]   want.
[01:23:48.200 --> 01:23:50.840]   However, they can hook you up with an independent attorney
[01:23:50.840 --> 01:23:53.320]   in most states to get questions answered
[01:23:53.320 --> 01:23:55.040]   at a pre-negotiated flat rate.
[01:23:55.040 --> 01:23:56.520]   And I love that.
[01:23:56.520 --> 01:23:59.760]   LegalZoom's estate plan bundles make this so easy.
[01:23:59.760 --> 01:24:01.960]   If you don't have yet a will or you want to update your wealth
[01:24:01.960 --> 01:24:03.960]   that's time to update mine, I'm going to do this.
[01:24:03.960 --> 01:24:06.200]   Or a living trust.
[01:24:06.200 --> 01:24:08.320]   You can do it all yourself, or you
[01:24:08.320 --> 01:24:11.280]   can contact their independent legal plan attorneys.
[01:24:11.280 --> 01:24:12.720]   They'll walk you through your options,
[01:24:12.720 --> 01:24:15.320]   recommend an estate plan that is the best solution
[01:24:15.320 --> 01:24:17.480]   for your needs.
[01:24:17.480 --> 01:24:19.280]   And since LegalZoom's not a law firm,
[01:24:19.280 --> 01:24:21.720]   you can count on efficiency and value.
[01:24:21.720 --> 01:24:24.920]   Everything's done on your terms, on your schedule.
[01:24:24.920 --> 01:24:29.320]   You'll know exactly what it's going to cost upfront, man.
[01:24:29.320 --> 01:24:31.520]   That by itself, you know?
[01:24:31.520 --> 01:24:33.640]   I love when you go on a law firm that said, OK,
[01:24:33.640 --> 01:24:36.040]   but you're going to give us a retainer against what
[01:24:36.040 --> 01:24:37.520]   we're going to charge you.
[01:24:37.520 --> 01:24:40.160]   And then we're going to still charge you more.
[01:24:40.160 --> 01:24:43.680]   LegalZoom-- it's the leader in helping small business owners
[01:24:43.680 --> 01:24:44.960]   and families with their legal needs.
[01:24:44.960 --> 01:24:46.440]   I love it, you will, too.
[01:24:46.440 --> 01:24:48.520]   Get your life organized with an estate plan bundle.

[01:25:05.760 --> 01:25:09.160]   Fire when ready.
[01:25:09.160 --> 01:25:10.600]   I'm not quite ready.
[01:25:10.600 --> 01:25:11.520]   OK.
[01:25:11.520 --> 01:25:12.960]   Renee, Richie.
[01:25:12.960 --> 01:25:14.640]   Fire when ready.
[01:25:14.640 --> 01:25:16.200]   All right, so I have some sort of a--
[01:25:16.200 --> 01:25:17.160]   I'm sending an image.
[01:25:17.160 --> 01:25:18.040]   I need to send an image to the--
[01:25:18.040 --> 01:25:18.880]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:25:18.880 --> 01:25:20.200]   That's all right.
[01:25:20.200 --> 01:25:22.200]   So I have sort of an old time classic
[01:25:22.200 --> 01:25:24.440]   that every once in a while I want to pick again,
[01:25:24.440 --> 01:25:25.360]   just because it's so awesome.
[01:25:25.360 --> 01:25:27.120]   And that's BBEdit by Bear Bones Talk.
[01:25:27.120 --> 01:25:27.920]   Where Rich Seagull.
[01:25:27.920 --> 01:25:28.800]   Yes, yes, yes.
[01:25:28.800 --> 01:25:31.760]   It just got updated again.
[01:25:31.760 --> 01:25:33.520]   We had the great pleasure of talking to him on debug
[01:25:33.520 --> 01:25:34.080]   a few weeks ago.
[01:25:34.080 --> 01:25:37.360]   And he took us through basically every stage of the Mac
[01:25:37.360 --> 01:25:40.840]   and how he was there with BBEdit to do things like carbon
[01:25:40.840 --> 01:25:43.680]   and Mac App Store and all these different things.
[01:25:43.680 --> 01:25:46.480]   And it is just-- I still write in BBEdit every day.
[01:25:46.480 --> 01:25:49.640]   I have all these fancy tools and he's added.
[01:25:49.640 --> 01:25:52.280]   The one I had recently started writing in Notes instead,
[01:25:52.280 --> 01:25:54.600]   just because Notes synced everywhere all the time
[01:25:54.600 --> 01:25:55.080]   immediately.
[01:25:55.080 --> 01:25:56.560]   It was like a giant clipboard.
[01:25:56.560 --> 01:25:58.080]   And now Rich has added--
[01:25:58.080 --> 01:26:00.000]   or sorry, I should say Bear Bones, although he seems
[01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:01.000]   like a one-man army.
[01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:03.240]   He has added iCloud Drive support now.
[01:26:03.240 --> 01:26:06.600]   So you can still store things in iCloud Drive or Dropbox.
[01:26:06.600 --> 01:26:09.000]   Like you always couldn't have them available everywhere.
[01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:14.080]   And I am someone who uses maybe 0.5% of the features
[01:26:14.080 --> 01:26:17.720]   in BBEdit because there's everything there from grep to--
[01:26:17.720 --> 01:26:20.520]   also, I used it again today just to convert something
[01:26:20.520 --> 01:26:23.200]   to Markdown because it was faster for me to do it in BBEdit
[01:26:23.200 --> 01:26:26.840]   because I knew how to do it then go to some web form and do it.
[01:26:26.840 --> 01:26:28.360]   It is just a powerhouse.
[01:26:28.360 --> 01:26:33.840]   If you have a Mac and you do any sort of professional writing
[01:26:33.840 --> 01:26:36.720]   from development to just writing articles,
[01:26:36.720 --> 01:26:38.640]   the tools there are unparalleled.
[01:26:38.640 --> 01:26:40.920]   So sometimes we talk about the new stuff
[01:26:40.920 --> 01:26:42.120]   and forget about the classics.
[01:26:42.120 --> 01:26:44.800]   And BBEdit is just absolutely one of the classics.
[01:26:44.800 --> 01:26:46.400]   You know, it's funny because when I set up
[01:26:46.400 --> 01:26:49.200]   that Minecraft server, I realized, oh, I need a nice GUI
[01:26:49.200 --> 01:26:50.200]   editor.
[01:26:50.200 --> 01:26:51.200]   I'm doing it on a Mac.
[01:26:51.200 --> 01:26:53.360]   Why should I use Emacs?
[01:26:53.360 --> 01:26:55.280]   And I have-- I own BBEdit.
[01:26:55.280 --> 01:26:56.040]   I love it.
[01:26:56.040 --> 01:26:57.640]   But I thought, you know, I haven't tried Text Wrangler.
[01:26:57.640 --> 01:26:59.200]   I think it's going to be all I need it.
[01:26:59.200 --> 01:27:00.600]   You can do it on the command line.
[01:27:00.600 --> 01:27:02.760]   You say Edit, File.
[01:27:02.760 --> 01:27:04.040]   It's awesome.
[01:27:04.040 --> 01:27:04.480]   It is.
[01:27:04.480 --> 01:27:05.960]   It's so great.
[01:27:05.960 --> 01:27:06.720]   And that's free.
[01:27:06.720 --> 01:27:07.960]   That's free.
[01:27:07.960 --> 01:27:09.120]   It's senselessly free.
[01:27:09.120 --> 01:27:10.240]   I mean, it is so great.
[01:27:10.240 --> 01:27:11.280]   Yeah.
[01:27:11.280 --> 01:27:12.560]   So I like having BBEdit.
[01:27:12.560 --> 01:27:14.600]   There are things, for instance, that BBEdit does.
[01:27:14.600 --> 01:27:17.560]   Like, I love-- and we never talk about this,
[01:27:17.560 --> 01:27:22.320]   but I love that you can create a system sheet that will let you do--
[01:27:22.320 --> 01:27:23.320]   Oh, the shell works.
[01:27:23.320 --> 01:27:24.320]   The bash command.
[01:27:24.320 --> 01:27:24.840]   The shell worksheet.
[01:27:24.840 --> 01:27:25.800]   Does bash command.
[01:27:25.800 --> 01:27:27.400]   So it becomes your terminal, but it's
[01:27:27.400 --> 01:27:29.360]   a terminal with memory and cut and paste
[01:27:29.360 --> 01:27:30.640]   and all the nice edit features.
[01:27:30.640 --> 01:27:32.160]   It's the terminal inside of Text Editor.
[01:27:32.160 --> 01:27:34.120]   It's fantastic.
[01:27:34.120 --> 01:27:37.000]   And it reminds me of the MPW, the Mac Programmer's workshop.
[01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:39.760]   I did the same thing in that, and I loved that.
[01:27:39.760 --> 01:27:42.240]   And I'm sure that's how it was the inspiration for Rich
[01:27:42.240 --> 01:27:43.000]   putting it in.
[01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:43.500]   Yeah.
[01:27:43.500 --> 01:27:44.000]   I'm sure.
[01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:46.000]   But that by itself-- and I know that's not in text.
[01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:46.640]   Well, maybe it is.
[01:27:46.640 --> 01:27:47.440]   I should check.
[01:27:47.440 --> 01:27:48.880]   I bet it's not in text wrangling.
[01:27:48.880 --> 01:27:50.960]   That would be worth buying BBEdit for a long.
[01:27:50.960 --> 01:27:51.840]   I just want to give money.
[01:27:51.840 --> 01:27:53.840]   I could easily get away with using text wrangling,
[01:27:53.840 --> 01:27:55.760]   but I just want to give Rich money so he keeps making it.
[01:27:55.760 --> 01:27:56.200]   I agree.
[01:27:56.200 --> 01:27:56.720]   Yeah.
[01:27:56.720 --> 01:27:57.220]   Absolutely.
[01:27:57.220 --> 01:27:58.720]   It's nice of him to do text wrangling.
[01:27:58.720 --> 01:27:59.320]   Yeah.
[01:27:59.320 --> 01:27:59.840]   Yeah.
[01:27:59.840 --> 01:28:01.320]   There are a couple of people at Bear Bones,
[01:28:01.320 --> 01:28:03.240]   and also he has a lot of developers
[01:28:03.240 --> 01:28:06.600]   who work on certain elements of it, like, for instance,
[01:28:06.600 --> 01:28:09.680]   someone who was just a god with JavaScript
[01:28:09.680 --> 01:28:11.520]   and does all the JavaScript highlighting code
[01:28:11.520 --> 01:28:12.480]   and that sort of stuff.
[01:28:12.480 --> 01:28:16.800]   But yeah, I love these apps where you have this on your drive,
[01:28:16.800 --> 01:28:19.920]   and at some point in the week, you will find a need for it.
[01:28:19.920 --> 01:28:23.400]   It's like I used to write every single column in it.
[01:28:23.400 --> 01:28:24.920]   I still write several columns in it,
[01:28:24.920 --> 01:28:26.640]   only because I like Scrivener a lot.
[01:28:26.640 --> 01:28:30.000]   But even so, when I'm doing a phone briefing or a meeting,
[01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:32.600]   that's the only thing I will ever take my notes on,
[01:28:32.600 --> 01:28:35.560]   because it's fast, it's reliable.
[01:28:35.560 --> 01:28:37.560]   You can customize it however you want.
[01:28:37.560 --> 01:28:39.640]   It has all kinds of tools and tricks on it,
[01:28:39.640 --> 01:28:42.120]   and it will not get in your way in any way, shape, or form.
[01:28:42.120 --> 01:28:44.840]   And like Rene says, sometimes you just want to put money
[01:28:44.840 --> 01:28:46.320]   in a box and send it to somebody,
[01:28:46.320 --> 01:28:49.120]   because not only how good the thing is,
[01:28:49.120 --> 01:28:51.240]   but how good and consistent it's been.
[01:28:51.240 --> 01:28:53.600]   I mean, this is, I was trying to remember
[01:28:53.600 --> 01:28:58.040]   if BBEdit actually predates the color Apple logo
[01:28:58.040 --> 01:29:00.920]   in the Apple menu.
[01:29:00.920 --> 01:29:05.160]   I think it came out after System 6.
[01:29:05.160 --> 01:29:06.800]   So I don't think it goes back to--
[01:29:06.800 --> 01:29:08.840]   Like those days, like System 7 days.
[01:29:08.840 --> 01:29:09.680]   Wow.
[01:29:09.680 --> 01:29:13.960]   It's so old that the first version that I bought
[01:29:13.960 --> 01:29:17.760]   came in a box with a printed spiral bound manual
[01:29:17.760 --> 01:29:19.480]   and a T-shirt.
[01:29:19.480 --> 01:29:22.760]   And I still have the T-shirt because it's an expensive T-shirt
[01:29:22.760 --> 01:29:24.560]   and it's not stretched out at all.
[01:29:24.560 --> 01:29:26.560]   That's-- you just got to see up.
[01:29:26.560 --> 01:29:29.240]   It's like-- I can't say enough about it.
[01:29:29.240 --> 01:29:32.080]   Rich Seagull is a really good personal friend of mine.
[01:29:32.080 --> 01:29:35.880]   As a matter of fact, but that doesn't mean--
[01:29:35.880 --> 01:29:37.840]   I actually became friends with him.
[01:29:37.840 --> 01:29:38.840]   Because of it.
[01:29:38.840 --> 01:29:40.920]   Here's something about how good he is.
[01:29:40.920 --> 01:29:44.160]   We became friends because Bear Bones had a tool
[01:29:44.160 --> 01:29:47.040]   at a male client called MailSmith
[01:29:47.040 --> 01:29:50.240]   that I was testing and didn't like--
[01:29:50.240 --> 01:29:52.960]   I thought a lot of stuff didn't work properly.
[01:29:52.960 --> 01:29:55.960]   And I wrote some bugs and said, here's this work this way.
[01:29:55.960 --> 01:29:59.240]   And so rather than saying, OK, this person's an idiot.
[01:29:59.240 --> 01:30:00.240]   And he's just a crank.
[01:30:00.240 --> 01:30:02.240]   He's a Mr. Hader person.
[01:30:02.240 --> 01:30:04.680]   He would ask questions and say, what if it worked this way
[01:30:04.680 --> 01:30:06.520]   and what if it did that way?
[01:30:06.520 --> 01:30:08.280]   And that's-- I'm not saying that you
[01:30:08.280 --> 01:30:10.160]   will have a 20-year friendship with somebody
[01:30:10.160 --> 01:30:13.000]   based on saying mean things about their product.
[01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:15.640]   But it says something about how seriously everyone at Bear
[01:30:15.640 --> 01:30:18.240]   Bones takes those products that they will listen and they will--
[01:30:18.240 --> 01:30:21.520]   if they won't do what you ask them to do,
[01:30:21.520 --> 01:30:23.080]   they will leave you deeply convinced
[01:30:23.080 --> 01:30:25.560]   that the reason why it doesn't do what you want to do,
[01:30:25.560 --> 01:30:27.120]   there's a really good reason for that.
[01:30:27.120 --> 01:30:27.620]   Anyway.
[01:30:27.620 --> 01:30:31.400]   I kind of wish they kept developing MailSmith.
[01:30:31.400 --> 01:30:32.520]   It grows on you.
[01:30:32.520 --> 01:30:36.560]   It had a really interesting methodology
[01:30:36.560 --> 01:30:38.640]   that might have thrown some early people
[01:30:38.640 --> 01:30:40.800]   because it really was like the whole premise
[01:30:40.800 --> 01:30:43.560]   was that you get too much email and your email client
[01:30:43.560 --> 01:30:45.800]   should handle most of it for you.
[01:30:45.800 --> 01:30:49.360]   And so if you try to think of it as having filters,
[01:30:49.360 --> 01:30:52.760]   you wouldn't-- it would seem complicated.
[01:30:52.760 --> 01:30:57.980]   Whereas it's definitely a Mail client written by people
[01:30:57.980 --> 01:31:00.400]   who have to deal with a lot of customer service mail
[01:31:00.400 --> 01:31:02.840]   and who are experts at writing text editors
[01:31:02.840 --> 01:31:04.520]   and doing things with text.
[01:31:04.520 --> 01:31:06.400]   And so that's why a lot of people still miss it.
[01:31:06.400 --> 01:31:07.200]   Yeah.
[01:31:07.200 --> 01:31:08.440]   Well, I've used it for 20 years.
[01:31:08.440 --> 01:31:10.840]   So I'll just say seconded and thirded everything
[01:31:10.840 --> 01:31:12.920]   that Renee and Andy said.
[01:31:12.920 --> 01:31:14.600]   I've written more words in BBEdit
[01:31:14.600 --> 01:31:17.440]   than I've probably written in any other piece of software combined.
[01:31:17.440 --> 01:31:18.640]   You used to write in it.
[01:31:18.640 --> 01:31:19.080]   Wow.
[01:31:19.080 --> 01:31:21.080]   Yeah, I still write in it to this day.
[01:31:21.080 --> 01:31:22.080]   Really?
[01:31:22.080 --> 01:31:25.160]   Most of my posts that I write are in BBEdit.
[01:31:25.160 --> 01:31:26.160]   Wow.
[01:31:26.160 --> 01:31:27.160]   Yeah.
[01:31:27.160 --> 01:31:28.200]   That's pretty impressive.
[01:31:28.200 --> 01:31:31.400]   I know a lot of websites were designed in BBEdit.
[01:31:31.400 --> 01:31:33.680]   The other feature they added a few years ago
[01:31:33.680 --> 01:31:35.000]   was the text factory.
[01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:37.000]   Because I always use BBEdit for Grap.
[01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:39.480]   Like really powerful search in a place.
[01:31:39.480 --> 01:31:42.960]   It has a full regular expression parser built into it.
[01:31:42.960 --> 01:31:44.640]   Like, pearl quality.
[01:31:44.640 --> 01:31:47.080]   That is the pearl syntax and everything, yeah.
[01:31:47.080 --> 01:31:51.400]   And so when I need-- well, you have to take log files
[01:31:51.400 --> 01:31:54.160]   and parse them, I'll use BBEdit to do that.
[01:31:54.160 --> 01:31:56.160]   And then they added this text factory, which is great.
[01:31:56.160 --> 01:31:59.960]   You can create a little thing that will process.
[01:31:59.960 --> 01:32:02.440]   It's like a super easy script that is just a step.
[01:32:02.440 --> 01:32:02.960]   Right.
[01:32:02.960 --> 01:32:04.720]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:32:04.720 --> 01:32:06.800]   I think this is-- let me see if I did this right.
[01:32:06.800 --> 01:32:09.080]   Is this the-- what is it?
[01:32:09.080 --> 01:32:11.640]   Shift, Shift, Return, I think?
[01:32:11.640 --> 01:32:13.000]   I didn't open a right worksheet.
[01:32:13.000 --> 01:32:16.240]   I was going to open a Bash shell worksheet.
[01:32:16.240 --> 01:32:17.280]   Anyway, you know what?
[01:32:17.280 --> 01:32:19.040]   We'll leave that as a--
[01:32:19.040 --> 01:32:20.280]   No, it is a shell worksheet.
[01:32:20.280 --> 01:32:21.680]   You have bare bones money.
[01:32:21.680 --> 01:32:23.880]   Just give bare bones money.
[01:32:23.880 --> 01:32:24.880]   Yeah.
[01:32:24.880 --> 01:32:25.880]   Where am I?
[01:32:25.880 --> 01:32:27.320]   I'm a bare, tri-text wrangler.
[01:32:27.320 --> 01:32:28.800]   Once you're sure, give bare bones money.
[01:32:28.800 --> 01:32:29.880]   Might be at it.
[01:32:29.880 --> 01:32:32.480]   Also, BBEdit has a 30-day unlimited--
[01:32:32.480 --> 01:32:33.280]   I think it's 30-day--
[01:32:33.280 --> 01:32:34.280]   You could try it.
[01:32:34.280 --> 01:32:35.280]   Yeah.
[01:32:35.280 --> 01:32:38.080]   And so-- and even when your trial is up, it's not OK.
[01:32:38.080 --> 01:32:40.880]   Jack Payup is like, hi, we're so glad you enjoyed it.
[01:32:40.880 --> 01:32:42.920]   Here's how easy we're going to make it for you
[01:32:42.920 --> 01:32:45.480]   to register BBEdit now.
[01:32:45.480 --> 01:32:46.560]   Awesome stuff.
[01:32:46.560 --> 01:32:50.080]   Even in the shell, it's awesome.
[01:32:50.080 --> 01:32:52.320]   I use it all the time.
[01:32:52.320 --> 01:32:54.080]   What do you got for us, Mr. Snow?
[01:32:54.080 --> 01:32:55.560]   Anything you'd like to tell us about?
[01:32:55.560 --> 01:32:57.240]   I have a pick.
[01:32:57.240 --> 01:32:59.760]   It is called Fairite Recording Studio.
[01:32:59.760 --> 01:33:03.240]   It is an iOS multi-track audio editor.
[01:33:03.240 --> 01:33:04.240]   Free to download.
[01:33:04.240 --> 01:33:07.640]   I think the buy-in features are total about $20.
[01:33:07.640 --> 01:33:09.680]   There are a couple in app purchases you can do.
[01:33:09.680 --> 01:33:13.400]   I've edited multiple episodes of podcasts entirely
[01:33:13.400 --> 01:33:16.080]   on the iPad using Fairite.
[01:33:16.080 --> 01:33:19.960]   There's a beta that is so hopefully coming out soon
[01:33:19.960 --> 01:33:22.960]   that will add a whole bunch of new gestures and stuff.
[01:33:22.960 --> 01:33:24.560]   But I'm able to edit.
[01:33:24.560 --> 01:33:26.680]   I try these things out, and I'm like, oh, yeah,
[01:33:26.680 --> 01:33:29.400]   it would be interesting to edit a podcast on iOS.
[01:33:29.400 --> 01:33:30.960]   But there's no chance that I'm actually
[01:33:30.960 --> 01:33:32.400]   going to be able to do that.
[01:33:32.400 --> 01:33:34.880]   And this is the first time that I've had that,
[01:33:34.880 --> 01:33:36.080]   and it's actually worked.
[01:33:36.080 --> 01:33:38.800]   So I've edited multiple podcasts using Fairite.
[01:33:38.800 --> 01:33:40.000]   It's powerful.
[01:33:40.000 --> 01:33:43.560]   It does everything that I wanted to do for podcast editing.
[01:33:43.560 --> 01:33:45.400]   How is it on the Pro?
[01:33:45.400 --> 01:33:46.240]   I mean, it's great.
[01:33:46.240 --> 01:33:47.400]   Because you have all that space.
[01:33:47.400 --> 01:33:48.400]   You've got all the space.
[01:33:48.400 --> 01:33:51.440]   And it works great, looks great.
[01:33:51.440 --> 01:33:53.360]   We took it apart, huh?
[01:33:53.360 --> 01:33:54.120]   OK.
[01:33:54.120 --> 01:33:57.120]   I was going to show you this mixer that Alex recommended
[01:33:57.120 --> 01:33:58.320]   last week, because we got it.
[01:33:58.320 --> 01:34:03.640]   And you can also edit on an iPad Pro or an iPad.
[01:34:03.640 --> 01:34:04.480]   But it's a DAW.
[01:34:04.480 --> 01:34:06.480]   It's a full DAW that connects to the mixer.
[01:34:06.480 --> 01:34:12.120]   So you can actually mix live sound on this thing.
[01:34:12.120 --> 01:34:13.920]   This thing was amazing.
[01:34:13.920 --> 01:34:14.440]   And--
[01:34:14.440 --> 01:34:17.120]   It's always 20 times the iPad.
[01:34:17.120 --> 01:34:18.840]   But still, yeah, it's amazing stuff.
[01:34:18.840 --> 01:34:20.240]   I mean, this software is essentially
[01:34:20.240 --> 01:34:21.920]   going from logic to this.
[01:34:21.920 --> 01:34:24.440]   You know how much that costs, by the way.
[01:34:24.440 --> 01:34:25.960]   $10,000.
[01:34:25.960 --> 01:34:26.960]   $299.
[01:34:26.960 --> 01:34:27.840]   Oh, OK.
[01:34:27.840 --> 01:34:31.360]   Actually, this was $399, because it's the 8.8 mics.
[01:34:31.360 --> 01:34:33.520]   You should get this for your podcasts.
[01:34:33.520 --> 01:34:37.200]   Because it auto ducks who's talking and not talking.
[01:34:37.200 --> 01:34:39.880]   And we should get it for our podcasts.
[01:34:39.880 --> 01:34:41.240]   8 XLRs there?
[01:34:41.240 --> 01:34:42.800]   Yeah.
[01:34:42.800 --> 01:34:44.720]   It's got a do-gun mixer in it.
[01:34:44.720 --> 01:34:46.120]   Anyway, Fairite.
[01:34:46.120 --> 01:34:48.280]   20 bucks all in if you decide to do it.
[01:34:48.280 --> 01:34:49.240]   And you can try it for free.
[01:34:49.240 --> 01:34:50.880]   Multitrack, it's got strip silence,
[01:34:50.880 --> 01:34:52.600]   which I use in Logic all the time.
[01:34:52.600 --> 01:34:54.280]   Yes, that's a great feature.
[01:34:54.280 --> 01:34:58.120]   It is-- it does automation, so you can do volume control.
[01:34:58.120 --> 01:34:59.880]   Have you done this the incomparable on this?
[01:34:59.880 --> 01:35:01.320]   I've done three episodes of the incomparable.
[01:35:01.320 --> 01:35:02.480]   What?
[01:35:02.480 --> 01:35:03.720]   Because that one is a big deal.
[01:35:03.720 --> 01:35:04.760]   With many people, right?
[01:35:04.760 --> 01:35:06.000]   Multitrack and everything.
[01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:06.760]   Yeah, it works great.
[01:35:06.760 --> 01:35:07.920]   Because you do those double-ended,
[01:35:07.920 --> 01:35:09.960]   which means you're getting the wave files from each other.
[01:35:09.960 --> 01:35:11.440]   Yeah, I've got the raw files from every panel.
[01:35:11.440 --> 01:35:13.040]   You've got a sync them up.
[01:35:13.040 --> 01:35:14.480]   And you've got it-- oh, man.
[01:35:14.480 --> 01:35:17.720]   And even just down to the fact that in a normal podcast
[01:35:17.720 --> 01:35:20.520]   editor or audio editor, you've got keyboard shortcuts
[01:35:20.520 --> 01:35:23.720]   for things like selecting all following tracks
[01:35:23.720 --> 01:35:27.200]   or for play and pause, where you're so used to using those
[01:35:27.200 --> 01:35:29.600]   on the keyboard, and it's all gestures on here.
[01:35:29.600 --> 01:35:32.440]   You know, triple tap to do this and tap with two fingers
[01:35:32.440 --> 01:35:33.080]   to do this.
[01:35:33.080 --> 01:35:36.640]   And it's great by a company called Wuji Juice, which
[01:35:36.640 --> 01:35:40.800]   is a funny name for a company, but it is a great little product.
[01:35:40.800 --> 01:35:44.480]   Could I record-- I can record into this on my iPad or not?
[01:35:44.480 --> 01:35:46.560]   Yeah, it will record Multitrack in.
[01:35:46.560 --> 01:35:48.080]   But the problem with iOS right now
[01:35:48.080 --> 01:35:50.080]   is you can't do the multi-enter thing where you've
[01:35:50.080 --> 01:35:52.920]   got Skype going and you're recording your own microphone.
[01:35:52.920 --> 01:35:54.560]   iOS sort of doesn't want you to do it.
[01:35:54.560 --> 01:35:55.840]   But for a single voice, for instance,
[01:35:55.840 --> 01:35:58.280]   I could do commercials, my radio stuff on this.
[01:35:58.280 --> 01:35:59.680]   Because sometimes I want to-- you know,
[01:35:59.680 --> 01:36:03.480]   I got that really nice, sure lightning adapter.
[01:36:03.480 --> 01:36:05.920]   Microphone is quite a good microphone.
[01:36:05.920 --> 01:36:10.520]   It would be very nice to be able to, like while I'm traveling,
[01:36:10.520 --> 01:36:12.520]   record into it, edit it, ship it off.
[01:36:12.520 --> 01:36:13.440]   And then you could send it out.
[01:36:13.440 --> 01:36:16.960]   You could export it as a wave or as Apple lossless
[01:36:16.960 --> 01:36:19.400]   or as an AC file.
[01:36:19.400 --> 01:36:20.760]   And yeah, it's pretty great.
[01:36:20.760 --> 01:36:25.440]   Multitrack editing from Wuji Juice free within app purchases,
[01:36:25.440 --> 01:36:26.200]   no more than $20.
[01:36:26.200 --> 01:36:27.040]   Not $20, yeah.
[01:36:27.040 --> 01:36:29.480]   For everything, for the works.
[01:36:29.480 --> 01:36:31.160]   Andy, are you ready now?
[01:36:31.160 --> 01:36:31.760]   I am ready.
[01:36:31.760 --> 01:36:34.280]   I just wanted to-- wanted Jason to have a photo.
[01:36:34.280 --> 01:36:36.520]   Sometimes we go a little bit off script,
[01:36:36.520 --> 01:36:39.240]   and not technically tech, just things we really like.
[01:36:39.240 --> 01:36:41.320]   Last week, I bought myself a new bicycle,
[01:36:41.320 --> 01:36:42.720]   as we talked about a little bit last week.
[01:36:42.720 --> 01:36:44.040]   Saw the picture, yes.
[01:36:44.040 --> 01:36:45.920]   The Trek 7.2 FX.
[01:36:45.920 --> 01:36:47.800]   So now I've been riding it for a whole week,
[01:36:47.800 --> 01:36:51.800]   and I am in love with this thing.
[01:36:51.800 --> 01:36:55.600]   And I'm speaking to people who are like me, who not necessarily
[01:36:55.600 --> 01:36:57.160]   gossamer in build.
[01:36:57.160 --> 01:37:00.120]   I don't look like someone who rides a bicycle.
[01:37:00.120 --> 01:37:05.000]   And my previous bike was what I bought with paper root money
[01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:08.760]   in the 1980s with a 10 speed with the down shifters
[01:37:08.760 --> 01:37:10.720]   on the tubes.
[01:37:10.720 --> 01:37:13.080]   This is so-- it's not just--
[01:37:13.080 --> 01:37:15.440]   I bought it with the idea that, well, I should--
[01:37:15.440 --> 01:37:16.560]   I've been doing a lot of walking,
[01:37:16.560 --> 01:37:18.680]   and I want to be doing more stuff like that.
[01:37:18.680 --> 01:37:20.680]   Maybe I could-- sort of just walking two or three miles.
[01:37:20.680 --> 01:37:23.320]   I can bike occasionally five to 10 miles.
[01:37:23.320 --> 01:37:28.080]   And it is so easy to ride these modern bikes that it really--
[01:37:28.080 --> 01:37:30.680]   I was riding it this morning, and it was more like transportation,
[01:37:30.680 --> 01:37:32.800]   literally, as having breakfast with somebody
[01:37:32.800 --> 01:37:33.920]   like five miles away.
[01:37:33.920 --> 01:37:35.640]   And it wasn't-- oh, isn't it nice?
[01:37:35.640 --> 01:37:38.240]   I'm out, and I'm having-- and I'm getting exercise.
[01:37:38.240 --> 01:37:39.920]   It's like, no, this is transportation
[01:37:39.920 --> 01:37:42.840]   to get me from my house to this diner,
[01:37:42.840 --> 01:37:45.120]   because you get 21 gears, not only that,
[01:37:45.120 --> 01:37:49.600]   but again, I'm used to the little levers in the down tube,
[01:37:49.600 --> 01:37:52.560]   where you have to take your hands off the handlebar,
[01:37:52.560 --> 01:37:54.960]   and twist it, and get the right gear.
[01:37:54.960 --> 01:37:56.800]   These are just a set of triggers.
[01:37:56.800 --> 01:37:57.880]   Just click it once for up.
[01:37:57.880 --> 01:38:00.280]   Click it the other one for down.
[01:38:00.280 --> 01:38:02.280]   So as soon as you're feeling more resistance
[01:38:02.280 --> 01:38:04.440]   than you want to deal with, just pull the trigger,
[01:38:04.440 --> 01:38:07.240]   and half a second later, it's a lot easier to pedal.
[01:38:07.240 --> 01:38:08.440]   The seats are now more comfortable,
[01:38:08.440 --> 01:38:11.840]   because they have done-- they have seen men and women naked
[01:38:11.840 --> 01:38:13.160]   at some point.
[01:38:13.160 --> 01:38:14.400]   They've designed this seat.
[01:38:14.400 --> 01:38:16.800]   And so it's a lot more comfortable to use.
[01:38:16.800 --> 01:38:19.800]   This is-- and I got this one, because it was--
[01:38:19.800 --> 01:38:20.960]   it happened to be the wire cutters
[01:38:20.960 --> 01:38:24.840]   picked for a commuter/fitness bike.
[01:38:24.840 --> 01:38:26.960]   And I thought there was going to be a good starting point.
[01:38:26.960 --> 01:38:29.560]   So I wound up starting to research this,
[01:38:29.560 --> 01:38:32.800]   and found out that this is almost universally praised
[01:38:32.800 --> 01:38:35.080]   as the Toyota Corolla of bikes.
[01:38:35.080 --> 01:38:38.200]   Like for people like me who just want a really well-made,
[01:38:38.200 --> 01:38:41.200]   easy-to-ride, comfortable bike, it will--
[01:38:41.200 --> 01:38:43.680]   it's good-looking, it's easy-to-ride,
[01:38:43.680 --> 01:38:46.160]   it's a lot of fun, it's completely reliable.
[01:38:46.160 --> 01:38:47.440]   And it's not terribly expensive.
[01:38:47.440 --> 01:38:50.360]   The list price on this is 490.
[01:38:50.360 --> 01:38:53.280]   And because I bought it in January, when no one is coming in,
[01:38:53.280 --> 01:38:56.680]   I got it for like 10% or 15% off.
[01:38:56.680 --> 01:38:58.480]   And now I've got the--
[01:38:58.480 --> 01:38:59.880]   put the rack on the back of it.
[01:38:59.880 --> 01:39:02.160]   I put the-- now I have a basket on the back of it.
[01:39:02.160 --> 01:39:05.080]   So it can hold my laptop and groceries and stuff like that.
[01:39:05.080 --> 01:39:06.840]   And I'm quite serious.
[01:39:06.840 --> 01:39:08.600]   I mean, I just love this bike.
[01:39:08.600 --> 01:39:10.280]   And I think that if there are people who
[01:39:10.280 --> 01:39:12.080]   have been sort of thinking about, yeah,
[01:39:12.080 --> 01:39:13.600]   I'd like to be a little bit more active.
[01:39:13.600 --> 01:39:15.200]   But I don't want to--
[01:39:15.200 --> 01:39:18.440]   I don't want to be-- spend all my time running or bicycling.
[01:39:18.440 --> 01:39:21.320]   And I don't want to have a heart attack with all the effort.
[01:39:21.320 --> 01:39:25.280]   This really does feel like, again, for someone who looks like me,
[01:39:25.280 --> 01:39:27.680]   who has my kind of attitude on bicycles.
[01:39:27.680 --> 01:39:31.480]   If I'm looking for excuses to take this out for errands
[01:39:31.480 --> 01:39:35.920]   instead of taking the car, this is just such a good starting
[01:39:35.920 --> 01:39:36.200]   point.
[01:39:36.200 --> 01:39:38.880]   And maybe even it'll be your ending point too.
[01:39:38.880 --> 01:39:40.480]   Like I said, can't recommend it highly enough.
[01:39:40.480 --> 01:39:42.840]   If you're looking for-- if it encourages somebody who has
[01:39:42.840 --> 01:39:44.320]   been sort of on the fence about, yeah,
[01:39:44.320 --> 01:39:47.040]   might think about getting a bike someday,
[01:39:47.040 --> 01:39:48.600]   I'm so totally happy with this.
[01:39:48.600 --> 01:39:51.760]   And if you're like me, this bike will make you super happy too.
[01:39:51.760 --> 01:39:55.480]   I remember the website Obama's My New Bicycle.
[01:39:55.480 --> 01:39:56.440]   I don't know what that means.
[01:39:56.440 --> 01:39:57.840]   Yeah, that was Matt Honan, wasn't it?
[01:39:57.840 --> 01:39:59.160]   Matt Honan did that.
[01:39:59.160 --> 01:40:00.240]   I'm so buying that bicycle.
[01:40:00.240 --> 01:40:01.000]   Thank you, Andy.
[01:40:01.000 --> 01:40:03.240]   Track is Andy's new bicycle.
[01:40:03.240 --> 01:40:04.000]   Yep.
[01:40:04.000 --> 01:40:07.680]   The only thing is, I just noticed the wire basket is also
[01:40:07.680 --> 01:40:08.400]   black.
[01:40:08.400 --> 01:40:10.680]   And so if go back to the pictures,
[01:40:10.680 --> 01:40:12.040]   only when I put it back and step back,
[01:40:12.040 --> 01:40:14.120]   like, wow, this actually looks kind of beautiful.
[01:40:14.120 --> 01:40:14.920]   I really like it.
[01:40:14.920 --> 01:40:17.240]   It's only that I realize that, oh, the color scheme of my
[01:40:17.240 --> 01:40:19.000]   bicycle is black and blue.
[01:40:19.000 --> 01:40:23.280]   Maybe that's not a good, a good omen.
[01:40:23.280 --> 01:40:24.040]   Anyway.
[01:40:24.040 --> 01:40:24.680]   No, that's good.
[01:40:24.680 --> 01:40:25.800]   So you're biking more?
[01:40:25.800 --> 01:40:28.720]   Or were you always a cyclist?
[01:40:28.720 --> 01:40:31.360]   I haven't biked in 20, 25 years.
[01:40:31.360 --> 01:40:35.560]   I would take constitutionals about every day or every other
[01:40:35.560 --> 01:40:37.720]   day of two to four miles.
[01:40:37.720 --> 01:40:39.720]   I've been doing that for like five or 10 years.
[01:40:39.720 --> 01:40:42.280]   But this is a good example.
[01:40:42.280 --> 01:40:45.800]   The reason why I wasn't riding my bike is that I had my
[01:40:45.800 --> 01:40:48.720]   1983, 1984, Univega.
[01:40:48.720 --> 01:40:51.720]   And after I moved here, I tried taking it for rides
[01:40:51.720 --> 01:40:52.400]   around the neighborhood.
[01:40:52.400 --> 01:40:55.320]   But it's so hard to get up hills in it.
[01:40:55.320 --> 01:40:57.880]   And because it's so hard to shift,
[01:40:57.880 --> 01:41:00.640]   you're not going to shift until you're desperate for a
[01:41:00.640 --> 01:41:02.000]   gear change.
[01:41:02.000 --> 01:41:04.040]   And so it was just such a--
[01:41:04.040 --> 01:41:08.040]   no, I didn't like waking up face down with feeling,
[01:41:08.040 --> 01:41:10.120]   tasting Rhodes Salt.
[01:41:10.120 --> 01:41:13.120]   And so I just put it in the garage and forgot about it for like eight years.
[01:41:13.120 --> 01:41:20.460]   But I took this for Test Drive last week, assuming I would just be doing a scouting thing, but
[01:41:20.460 --> 01:41:25.140]   went for a two-mile ride around the neighborhood around the shop and was going up hills.
[01:41:25.140 --> 01:41:26.140]   No problem.
[01:41:26.140 --> 01:41:28.740]   Was it any problem getting my bike legs back?
[01:41:28.740 --> 01:41:33.780]   Like I said, at the very, very worst when I'm going up hills, I just click, click, click,
[01:41:33.780 --> 01:41:36.980]   click into the easiest gear whatsoever.
[01:41:36.980 --> 01:41:41.020]   And then I'm going up the hill at a walking speed, but, and maybe I'm breathing a little
[01:41:41.020 --> 01:41:44.820]   bit heavy and I can hear, I can feel my heart rate going up, but those are good things.
[01:41:44.820 --> 01:41:48.220]   I don't feel like I'm going to fall off and pass out and die.
[01:41:48.220 --> 01:41:51.380]   So it's, like I said, definitely take a look.
[01:41:51.380 --> 01:41:54.980]   Also if you're thinking about this, January and February are great months to go shop for
[01:41:54.980 --> 01:42:00.140]   bikes because in March, people who own bikes are going to be taking their bikes back to
[01:42:00.140 --> 01:42:05.340]   the shop to have them upgraded or maintained for the spring and people who are just going
[01:42:05.340 --> 01:42:08.140]   to see people on bicycles, I should buy a bicycle.
[01:42:08.140 --> 01:42:10.580]   We're asked in January and February, nobody's in the store.
[01:42:10.580 --> 01:42:12.780]   They're very, very pleased to have something to talk to.
[01:42:12.780 --> 01:42:14.380]   I was just thinking that.
[01:42:14.380 --> 01:42:19.100]   It was one of the best consumer experiences ever because just I had two people helping
[01:42:19.100 --> 01:42:20.100]   me.
[01:42:20.100 --> 01:42:21.100]   One of them was named Hans.
[01:42:21.100 --> 01:42:23.620]   That was another thing that really sold me on this bike.
[01:42:23.620 --> 01:42:32.340]   Hans, he's not Dutch, he's American, but a bicycle technician named Hans, I have to
[01:42:32.340 --> 01:42:34.580]   think that I'm in very, very good hands.
[01:42:34.580 --> 01:42:35.940]   So as I said, highest rate.
[01:42:35.940 --> 01:42:36.940]   Everyone recommends track.
[01:42:36.940 --> 01:42:39.700]   I was asking around a couple of months ago and all I heard back was track.
[01:42:39.700 --> 01:42:41.820]   Yeah, I've had tracks.
[01:42:41.820 --> 01:42:43.740]   I've always loved riding bikes.
[01:42:43.740 --> 01:42:46.940]   It's easy on the body, but it's just a great way to get around.
[01:42:46.940 --> 01:42:50.220]   I feel like such a dope for buying it this year instead of five years ago.
[01:42:50.220 --> 01:42:51.780]   Again, I'm just having so much fun.
[01:42:51.780 --> 01:42:53.100]   I'm enjoying it so much.
[01:42:53.100 --> 01:42:56.180]   Yeah, you're moving so fast.
[01:42:56.180 --> 01:42:57.180]   It's like walking.
[01:42:57.180 --> 01:42:59.580]   You're getting the exercise that you're seeing so much more.
[01:42:59.580 --> 01:43:02.180]   It's so much better than driving because you're outside.
[01:43:02.180 --> 01:43:05.340]   I just think you might go in here, but not this year.
[01:43:05.340 --> 01:43:06.980]   Yeah, this year's perfect.
[01:43:06.980 --> 01:43:12.300]   One of my normal walking routes is about two, like a coffee shop that's three miles away.
[01:43:12.300 --> 01:43:15.180]   The first time I took the bike out, I was like, "Oh, I'm there already."
[01:43:15.180 --> 01:43:16.180]   It's fun.
[01:43:16.180 --> 01:43:18.860]   Well, there is an Apple connection.
[01:43:18.860 --> 01:43:24.940]   It's how Steve Jobs for a while explained computers to people.
[01:43:24.940 --> 01:43:25.940]   Wheels for the mind.
[01:43:25.940 --> 01:43:27.420]   Wheels for the mind, exactly.
[01:43:27.420 --> 01:43:32.980]   Humans could only go so fast until they invent the bicycle.
[01:43:32.980 --> 01:43:37.980]   And by the way, I understand Hans, if your tires get low, Hans will be glad to bump you
[01:43:37.980 --> 01:43:38.980]   up.
[01:43:38.980 --> 01:43:41.820]   Yeah, I mean, I'll believe me later.
[01:43:41.820 --> 01:43:43.820]   I'm sorry.
[01:43:43.820 --> 01:43:46.580]   Our show today brought to you by Squarespace.
[01:43:46.580 --> 01:43:48.220]   In a way, this is my new bicycle.
[01:43:48.220 --> 01:43:53.180]   I love the idea that I can go to Squarespace, get really solid hosting, software that's
[01:43:53.180 --> 01:43:59.140]   very easy to use, make a site in minutes, and you can do it for free if you'd only need
[01:43:59.140 --> 01:44:01.580]   the site for a few weeks.
[01:44:01.580 --> 01:44:05.060]   Squarespace is the place, but the beauty part is once you've tried it for free and you get
[01:44:05.060 --> 01:44:08.620]   a sense of what you can do, it's very affordable.
[01:44:08.620 --> 01:44:13.060]   And man, the features they have, you're starting with those great designer templates.
[01:44:13.060 --> 01:44:16.780]   I mean, the best designers in engineering in the world go into Squarespace templates.
[01:44:16.780 --> 01:44:18.980]   They're all mobile responsive.
[01:44:18.980 --> 01:44:21.220]   That means they work on any size screen.
[01:44:21.220 --> 01:44:24.580]   That's kind of now the starting point for any good website.
[01:44:24.580 --> 01:44:27.500]   They use state of the art stuff behind the scenes.
[01:44:27.500 --> 01:44:29.300]   These sites never go down.
[01:44:29.300 --> 01:44:33.380]   All sites are e-commerce capable.
[01:44:33.380 --> 01:44:38.300]   And it's going to, most important, it's going to look exactly like you want, not like some
[01:44:38.300 --> 01:44:44.660]   cookie cutter site, just because they use the word template doesn't mean it's any way.
[01:44:44.660 --> 01:44:48.740]   Each site is a unique little snowflake is in no way cookie cutter.
[01:44:48.740 --> 01:44:51.380]   It's just fantastic.
[01:44:51.380 --> 01:44:53.580]   I love the cover sheet capability.
[01:44:53.580 --> 01:44:56.660]   I've been using that as the entryway to my site.
[01:44:56.660 --> 01:45:02.220]   The fact that you could put video and motion with an animated GIF and all of that just
[01:45:02.220 --> 01:45:04.020]   makes it so cool.
[01:45:04.020 --> 01:45:09.340]   And then of course you've got integration in very easily to your other social media.
[01:45:09.340 --> 01:45:12.340]   So I have links on there to Facebook and Twitter, Instagram and YouTube.
[01:45:12.340 --> 01:45:13.980]   That's just automatic.
[01:45:13.980 --> 01:45:15.220]   I put my blog in there.
[01:45:15.220 --> 01:45:16.580]   I put my photos in there.
[01:45:16.580 --> 01:45:18.620]   I even have an events calendar.
[01:45:18.620 --> 01:45:20.300]   I love this picture.
[01:45:20.300 --> 01:45:21.980]   Before I take that, I would take that picture.
[01:45:21.980 --> 01:45:23.620]   I love that picture.
[01:45:23.620 --> 01:45:29.620]   I have John, our studio engineer, just in a gassed at something.
[01:45:29.620 --> 01:45:30.620]   I said, no doubt.
[01:45:30.620 --> 01:45:32.900]   Look, let me give you a tip.
[01:45:32.900 --> 01:45:36.220]   If you're going to create a website, go to Squarespace.
[01:45:36.220 --> 01:45:39.900]   Many of their users find they have several sites with Squarespace.
[01:45:39.900 --> 01:45:42.420]   You start up your personal site and you say, boy, this was easy.
[01:45:42.420 --> 01:45:47.140]   You do then for your business, then you do it for your photography.
[01:45:47.140 --> 01:45:48.660]   It's just awesome.
[01:45:48.660 --> 01:45:52.940]   It will look like it's been designed by the pros, but you have complete control.
[01:45:52.940 --> 01:45:55.420]   Of course they do have a developer platform if you're a pro.
[01:45:55.420 --> 01:45:58.100]   And you can go to the next step with that as well too.
[01:45:58.100 --> 01:46:02.660]   24/7 support, free custom domain name with annual purchase.
[01:46:02.660 --> 01:46:06.980]   I could go on and on, but just go to squarespace.com and try it today.
[01:46:06.980 --> 01:46:11.300]   And don't forget, if you decide to buy, use the offer code MACBreak.
[01:46:11.300 --> 01:46:15.660]   That way you'll get 10% off and they'll also know you heard about it on MACBreak Weekly.
[01:46:15.660 --> 01:46:17.220]   They're on a lot of podcasts now.
[01:46:17.220 --> 01:46:18.660]   They started with us.
[01:46:18.660 --> 01:46:23.140]   I like to think we put Squarespace on the map, but they have become one of the best supporters
[01:46:23.140 --> 01:46:24.140]   of podcasting.
[01:46:24.140 --> 01:46:26.820]   They ought to be supported for that alone.
[01:46:26.820 --> 01:46:30.940]   Squarespace, you should.
[01:46:30.940 --> 01:46:32.940]   You should.
[01:46:32.940 --> 01:46:37.580]   I think we can wrap things up here in the Twit Brickhouse studio.
[01:46:37.580 --> 01:46:44.740]   Unless you guys, I'll give you a last opportunity, any stories that I neglected to talk about
[01:46:44.740 --> 01:46:45.740]   that are big.
[01:46:45.740 --> 01:46:48.820]   We were asked on iOS today about Apple Paying Canada.
[01:46:48.820 --> 01:46:52.020]   Is it still really Richie, just American Express?
[01:46:52.020 --> 01:46:53.020]   It is.
[01:46:53.020 --> 01:46:56.620]   And that, depending on where you live, because a lot of the places are independent proprietorship.
[01:46:56.620 --> 01:46:59.460]   So for example, second cup is our Starbucks chain.
[01:46:59.460 --> 01:47:01.740]   So some take it, some don't.
[01:47:01.740 --> 01:47:03.180]   It's a little bit unpredictable.
[01:47:03.180 --> 01:47:05.660]   But you can use it in the US when you travel, in the UK when you travel.
[01:47:05.660 --> 01:47:07.820]   So it's not great, but it's not terrible.
[01:47:07.820 --> 01:47:08.820]   Better than nothing.
[01:47:08.820 --> 01:47:09.820]   Yep.
[01:47:09.820 --> 01:47:13.540]   I love the story from TechCrunch that Bank of America and Wells Fargo are both working
[01:47:13.540 --> 01:47:16.060]   to put Apple Pay in their ATMs.
[01:47:16.060 --> 01:47:17.060]   So great.
[01:47:17.060 --> 01:47:18.060]   Why?
[01:47:18.060 --> 01:47:19.820]   I mean, why didn't we think of that?
[01:47:19.820 --> 01:47:20.820]   That's such a brilliant idea.
[01:47:20.820 --> 01:47:22.340]   So much more secure.
[01:47:22.340 --> 01:47:23.660]   You know that I love Americans, right?
[01:47:23.660 --> 01:47:24.740]   Like you guys are fantastic.
[01:47:24.740 --> 01:47:28.620]   But watching Americans try to learn how to use pen and chip while I was there last week.
[01:47:28.620 --> 01:47:30.260]   We use it so fast.
[01:47:30.260 --> 01:47:31.260]   We've just had it for 10 years.
[01:47:31.260 --> 01:47:32.260]   You're used to it.
[01:47:32.260 --> 01:47:34.780]   And we switched to Tap and Pay, I think a decade ago.
[01:47:34.780 --> 01:47:37.780]   So we barely even use that anymore unless it's really high dollar.
[01:47:37.780 --> 01:47:40.060]   But there it was just it was just a flummoxed people.
[01:47:40.060 --> 01:47:41.580]   Why don't I put my card?
[01:47:41.580 --> 01:47:42.580]   Okay.
[01:47:42.580 --> 01:47:43.580]   And then they take it.
[01:47:43.580 --> 01:47:44.580]   We take it out too fast.
[01:47:44.580 --> 01:47:46.140]   No, no, you have to leave it in.
[01:47:46.140 --> 01:47:47.340]   I mean, this whole thing is different.
[01:47:47.340 --> 01:47:49.300]   And then it's still chip and sign.
[01:47:49.300 --> 01:47:50.300]   Yeah.
[01:47:50.300 --> 01:47:53.420]   So if they can get everyone on Apple Pay, Google wall, all that stuff is faster, the
[01:47:53.420 --> 01:47:54.580]   better.
[01:47:54.580 --> 01:47:57.460]   The idea that you wouldn't need a card, you just go up, you tap your Apple Watch or your
[01:47:57.460 --> 01:47:59.820]   Apple phone to the ATM.
[01:47:59.820 --> 01:48:01.300]   And that's it.
[01:48:01.300 --> 01:48:03.300]   I guess they're still going to want to pin probably.
[01:48:03.300 --> 01:48:06.300]   Well, one of the best things about the Apple Pay is here, you've been able to tap and
[01:48:06.300 --> 01:48:09.820]   pay forever, but there's a limit between $60 and $100 depending on the reseller because
[01:48:09.820 --> 01:48:11.860]   they don't want to take on the responsibility.
[01:48:11.860 --> 01:48:15.780]   But with Apple Pay, American Express said there's no limit because they'll take your, your
[01:48:15.780 --> 01:48:18.500]   part like the heart rate monitor, just proof of ownership.
[01:48:18.500 --> 01:48:20.020]   So I just use it for everything.
[01:48:20.020 --> 01:48:21.020]   It's great.
[01:48:21.020 --> 01:48:22.020]   By a car that way.
[01:48:22.020 --> 01:48:24.060]   I'm going to use Apple.
[01:48:24.060 --> 01:48:26.260]   Do you mind if I do you have something I could tap?
[01:48:26.260 --> 01:48:27.260]   That's a windshield.
[01:48:27.260 --> 01:48:28.260]   I don't.
[01:48:28.260 --> 01:48:31.260]   Oh, the coffee shop I went to, they had a little square tap reader and I hadn't seen
[01:48:31.260 --> 01:48:32.260]   that before.
[01:48:32.260 --> 01:48:33.260]   It just came out.
[01:48:33.260 --> 01:48:34.260]   Yeah.
[01:48:34.260 --> 01:48:35.260]   It'll dongle out the square thing.
[01:48:35.260 --> 01:48:37.380]   You tap your watch and you grab your coffee and you go.
[01:48:37.380 --> 01:48:41.380]   If you took the quarterly results from Microsoft, which also came out this week, compared to
[01:48:41.380 --> 01:48:47.260]   the Apple, one thing that you could deduce according to Mac rumors, the iPad Pro outsells
[01:48:47.260 --> 01:48:49.260]   the Microsoft Surface.
[01:48:49.260 --> 01:48:57.580]   Oh, that's, that's, that's, that's realized that the, but the pro is one of many tablet-like
[01:48:57.580 --> 01:48:58.980]   computers that run Windows.
[01:48:58.980 --> 01:49:01.580]   So it's competing with a lot of different devices.
[01:49:01.580 --> 01:49:03.780]   And also the service says the numbers.
[01:49:03.780 --> 01:49:04.780]   Yeah.
[01:49:04.780 --> 01:49:08.340]   Also, if you, if you're talking about, if you include again, all in ones that have like
[01:49:08.340 --> 01:49:11.980]   a dockable, a dockable keyboard, that's a different number in power release.
[01:49:11.980 --> 01:49:12.980]   Yeah.
[01:49:12.980 --> 01:49:15.900]   That's, I think it always works.
[01:49:15.900 --> 01:49:18.860]   It's kind of, it's kind of, it's, it's kind of, every time that a Apple does the, does
[01:49:18.860 --> 01:49:24.420]   the call, I always wind up tweeting out this, this video to an S.E.T.V sketch in which Dave
[01:49:24.420 --> 01:49:29.860]   Thomas plays like a Russian, like a Russian communications person who says, has a big,
[01:49:29.860 --> 01:49:31.060]   has a big map of Russia.
[01:49:31.060 --> 01:49:34.020]   Now let's find out how big Australia is.
[01:49:34.020 --> 01:49:36.180]   He put that, he puts out the Australia.
[01:49:36.180 --> 01:49:38.780]   Look how tiny I'll put it.
[01:49:38.780 --> 01:49:39.780]   Mother Russia.
[01:49:39.780 --> 01:49:44.260]   It's like, okay, it doesn't, you should have, you should take no pride in an Apple user
[01:49:44.260 --> 01:49:48.460]   of how much money that Apple makes and how many industries it could buy with its cash
[01:49:48.460 --> 01:49:49.460]   on hand.
[01:49:49.460 --> 01:49:53.020]   And it doesn't matter if it's selling more iPad Pros than Microsoft is selling Surface
[01:49:53.020 --> 01:49:54.020]   tablets.
[01:49:54.020 --> 01:49:55.020]   It's, it's just Goshen embarrassing.
[01:49:55.020 --> 01:50:00.740]   And as long as recovering rumors, here's a good one that, from, I think, the street
[01:50:00.740 --> 01:50:07.740]   is, Apple is talking to Hollywood and may in fact launch a cable like over the top service
[01:50:07.740 --> 01:50:09.820]   for the Apple TV in the fall.
[01:50:09.820 --> 01:50:11.500]   Joss Whedon is free, just saying.
[01:50:11.500 --> 01:50:12.780]   A lot of bundles.
[01:50:12.780 --> 01:50:16.420]   They wanted, they've been wanting to do this for a long time.
[01:50:16.420 --> 01:50:20.500]   In fact, I'm sure it was intended to be timed with the release of the Apple TV 4, didn't
[01:50:20.500 --> 01:50:21.500]   happen.
[01:50:21.500 --> 01:50:22.500]   Well, this is different.
[01:50:22.500 --> 01:50:24.380]   So that, the over the top streaming service is one thing.
[01:50:24.380 --> 01:50:27.620]   This is the idea of Apple making original programming the way Netflix and Amazon Prime
[01:50:27.620 --> 01:50:28.620]   does.
[01:50:28.620 --> 01:50:29.620]   So they wouldn't be dependent on other networks.
[01:50:29.620 --> 01:50:31.540]   They basically roll their own stuff.
[01:50:31.540 --> 01:50:33.140]   Everybody is trying this right now.
[01:50:33.140 --> 01:50:38.020]   In fact, there's a story I, some people who know me know that I'm a Doctor Who fan and
[01:50:38.020 --> 01:50:41.420]   Doctor Who fell off all the streaming services yesterday.
[01:50:41.420 --> 01:50:42.420]   What?
[01:50:42.420 --> 01:50:47.420]   Went off Netflix and Hulu, which had the special deal with the BBC and Amazon Prime.
[01:50:47.420 --> 01:50:48.420]   The horror.
[01:50:48.420 --> 01:50:52.340]   And what's interesting about this is there are rumors that the BBC, that BBC Worldwide
[01:50:52.340 --> 01:50:57.260]   is going to launch an iPlayer for the US that's a pay streaming service, right?
[01:50:57.260 --> 01:50:58.260]   That's a brilliant idea.
[01:50:58.260 --> 01:51:02.780]   What's interesting is everybody wants your monthly fee for their bundle of content.
[01:51:02.780 --> 01:51:05.460]   And it is going to be a problem at some point.
[01:51:05.460 --> 01:51:08.100]   Everybody who has this fantasy that they're going to pay their internet bill and get to
[01:51:08.100 --> 01:51:12.380]   watch TV for free, they're going to end up having like, well, I love this TV show, but
[01:51:12.380 --> 01:51:15.340]   it's only available if I pay $8 a month over here.
[01:51:15.340 --> 01:51:17.500]   Can you imagine if Apple was using that?
[01:51:17.500 --> 01:51:20.260]   It's like a universal, you have to pay for it at EMC.
[01:51:20.260 --> 01:51:21.740]   You've got to pay for Sony.
[01:51:21.740 --> 01:51:23.180]   You've got like each music company.
[01:51:23.180 --> 01:51:25.340]   It's just, it's unmanageable for consumers.
[01:51:25.340 --> 01:51:26.580]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:51:26.580 --> 01:51:30.300]   It's frustrating the exclusive thing, but that is where it seems to be going now.
[01:51:30.300 --> 01:51:32.180]   Everybody wants to get a piece of the pie.
[01:51:32.180 --> 01:51:34.260]   And in fact, there's also the threat.
[01:51:34.260 --> 01:51:39.740]   One of the reasons Netflix is spending $6 billion on content this year, which is $6 billion
[01:51:39.740 --> 01:51:44.900]   on content to be, is because they see a great vulnerability, which is what if their partners
[01:51:44.900 --> 01:51:48.420]   who sell them reruns of old shows pull all their content and start their own streaming
[01:51:48.420 --> 01:51:49.420]   services.
[01:51:49.420 --> 01:51:50.420]   They're not in control of their destiny.
[01:51:50.420 --> 01:51:54.180]   They want to be like HBO, where you're paying for Netflix for Netflix content, not for other
[01:51:54.180 --> 01:51:55.460]   people's content.
[01:51:55.460 --> 01:52:01.060]   But you know, the CW has said, and CBS has said their plan is to pull those CW shows
[01:52:01.060 --> 01:52:05.820]   do really well on Netflix, Arrow and the Flash and shows like that.
[01:52:05.820 --> 01:52:08.340]   The 100 or the 100 it's pronounced.
[01:52:08.340 --> 01:52:10.620]   I learned my lesson.
[01:52:10.620 --> 01:52:14.060]   They're going to do their own streaming service, so they're going to roll it into CBS All Access.
[01:52:14.060 --> 01:52:16.020]   They're going to pull that stuff off Netflix eventually.
[01:52:16.020 --> 01:52:17.660]   So Netflix is right.
[01:52:17.660 --> 01:52:20.740]   It's going to be everybody wants it once in on this.
[01:52:20.740 --> 01:52:24.700]   So is it a surprise that Apple might want to pay some programmers for this stuff?
[01:52:24.700 --> 01:52:28.580]   I'm not sure whether that should be a great priority for Apple, but I'm kind of not surprised
[01:52:28.580 --> 01:52:29.580]   that they might.
[01:52:29.580 --> 01:52:31.300]   They're talking up services revenue, right?
[01:52:31.300 --> 01:52:35.700]   What would be another way for Apple to get money from its existing customers is creative
[01:52:35.700 --> 01:52:36.700]   video service.
[01:52:36.700 --> 01:52:37.700]   Yeah.
[01:52:37.700 --> 01:52:43.060]   But at the same time, when I think about this idea, I think about, okay, so I'm a producer
[01:52:43.060 --> 01:52:46.180]   and I'm a studio and I've got a great idea for a series.
[01:52:46.180 --> 01:52:48.060]   It's all packaged and ready to go.
[01:52:48.060 --> 01:52:51.260]   I would first try to pitch it maybe to Netflix.
[01:52:51.260 --> 01:52:53.620]   And if they said no, I would see if HBO was interested.
[01:52:53.620 --> 01:52:56.460]   And they say no, maybe I would pitch it to Hulu.
[01:52:56.460 --> 01:53:02.700]   And then I'd start thinking, okay, PlayStation network or Apple, because this isn't this
[01:53:02.700 --> 01:53:04.380]   isn't three or four years ago.
[01:53:04.380 --> 01:53:10.300]   This is where people, Netflix has right now has the prestige of a streaming streaming
[01:53:10.300 --> 01:53:11.300]   service right now.
[01:53:11.300 --> 01:53:13.100]   That's where you want your series to land.
[01:53:13.100 --> 01:53:17.740]   I don't know what Apple can deliver as an enticement because it's certainly not going
[01:53:17.740 --> 01:53:23.020]   to be it's going to be delivering a certain audience, but they're not committed to making
[01:53:23.020 --> 01:53:27.860]   sure that this thing that you spent five years developing and shooting will be available
[01:53:27.860 --> 01:53:29.420]   to anybody who wants to see it.
[01:53:29.420 --> 01:53:32.260]   It will be available to anybody who owns an Apple device.
[01:53:32.260 --> 01:53:34.260]   Well, it beats is on Android.
[01:53:34.260 --> 01:53:35.260]   So it's hard.
[01:53:35.260 --> 01:53:39.540]   Andy, I think I can tell you what they're going to provide, which is money.
[01:53:39.540 --> 01:53:43.940]   And if you're a TV studio, a movie studio and you've got Netflix is willing to pay you
[01:53:43.940 --> 01:53:48.500]   X and Apple is willing to pay you several tens of millions of dollars more than X, you're
[01:53:48.500 --> 01:53:52.940]   probably going to go unless it is a, you know, some sort of artistic control for
[01:53:52.940 --> 01:53:54.060]   some sort of niche show.
[01:53:54.060 --> 01:53:56.780]   I mean, in general, the studio is going to go where the money is.
[01:53:56.780 --> 01:54:00.780]   And if Apple puts up the money, then they, it'll go there.
[01:54:00.780 --> 01:54:03.180]   That's just how that industry works.
[01:54:03.180 --> 01:54:08.100]   But that's, I'm sorry to shatter your dreams, but that's how it works.
[01:54:08.100 --> 01:54:13.540]   Money talks, but money talks, but you're often talking to people who already have more
[01:54:13.540 --> 01:54:14.540]   money than God.
[01:54:14.540 --> 01:54:19.540]   If you're Louis CK or somebody like that, an aatur who has a very specific thing they
[01:54:19.540 --> 01:54:25.580]   want to do or actually talking about Aziz Ansari and Alan Yang doing Master of None,
[01:54:25.580 --> 01:54:27.540]   where they're sort of shopping it around.
[01:54:27.540 --> 01:54:32.180]   Yes, I think that them, you know, they want to pick where they want to go to a certain
[01:54:32.180 --> 01:54:33.180]   extent.
[01:54:33.180 --> 01:54:37.900]   But there's also a lot of stuff that, you know, it's not, it's not that light touch
[01:54:37.900 --> 01:54:38.900]   stuff.
[01:54:38.900 --> 01:54:43.300]   It is from the factory and the factory wants whoever will pay the most for the money.
[01:54:43.300 --> 01:54:48.580]   But remember that really CK show is that, is that way because his deal is that I deliver
[01:54:48.580 --> 01:54:53.620]   you a show that you then air and you write the check for it and that's it.
[01:54:53.620 --> 01:54:57.700]   I also have a problem imagining Apple saying, we don't care.
[01:54:57.700 --> 01:54:59.420]   We will not even ask for a script.
[01:54:59.420 --> 01:55:03.820]   We will not ask for any approval of what you do or who you hire.
[01:55:03.820 --> 01:55:07.580]   And when you give this to us, we will definitely put it on the streaming service.
[01:55:07.580 --> 01:55:12.660]   And as opposed to saying, we're so excited to be in business with you.
[01:55:12.660 --> 01:55:18.020]   We're going to have so many great ideas together because we understand things about our audience
[01:55:18.020 --> 01:55:19.020]   that you don't.
[01:55:19.020 --> 01:55:24.340]   We're so happy, Louis, to help you not have all that terrible language that will put off
[01:55:24.340 --> 01:55:27.140]   our car because, you know, we don't want to have porn on there.
[01:55:27.140 --> 01:55:33.380]   So this thing where you wind up kind of hitting this woman, we're looking out for you here.
[01:55:33.380 --> 01:55:35.020]   So we're not going to let you do that.
[01:55:35.020 --> 01:55:37.900]   Well, that's why he was not that's why he wouldn't take it there.
[01:55:37.900 --> 01:55:42.220]   But some some other studio that's trying to sell programming and has sold it to everyone
[01:55:42.220 --> 01:55:45.500]   else in Hollywood is going to is going to have a different story.
[01:55:45.500 --> 01:55:51.340]   Which creatives in Hollywood, you know, in the TV industry do not get the luxury of
[01:55:51.340 --> 01:55:54.180]   shopping their show and having complete control over it.
[01:55:54.180 --> 01:55:55.940]   So we can argue about the edge cases.
[01:55:55.940 --> 01:55:59.020]   And I would actually argue that I think there's some creative people in that industry who
[01:55:59.020 --> 01:56:03.340]   would probably enjoy the challenge of working on something that they would be like the marquee
[01:56:03.340 --> 01:56:05.340]   part of an Apple product launch.
[01:56:05.340 --> 01:56:11.260]   But you know, most of the providers of content would probably be happy to go to Apple instead
[01:56:11.260 --> 01:56:16.660]   of Netflix if Apple would back up a larger truck full of money to their office.
[01:56:16.660 --> 01:56:17.660]   I don't see.
[01:56:17.660 --> 01:56:18.660]   I don't see.
[01:56:18.660 --> 01:56:23.180]   I don't think that it would be truck of money so much as we will give you a multi year commitment
[01:56:23.180 --> 01:56:27.780]   where we will bet we will bet we will underwrite 80 episodes of this and we will put all of
[01:56:27.780 --> 01:56:28.780]   them online.
[01:56:28.780 --> 01:56:32.180]   So we're going to be we're going to be giving you three or four guaranteed seasons.
[01:56:32.180 --> 01:56:36.140]   Like I said, I'll all I'm all I'm saying is that I would find it difficult for someone
[01:56:36.140 --> 01:56:39.620]   to say, oh, let's definitely bring this to Apple first.
[01:56:39.620 --> 01:56:45.260]   And history has shown that simply writing a huge check to get talent to come to you.
[01:56:45.260 --> 01:56:48.580]   You got to have a much bigger plan than that because that's going to get people who can
[01:56:48.580 --> 01:56:54.620]   be bought for money only as opposed to people who are going to give you give you the prestige
[01:56:54.620 --> 01:56:58.220]   series that have been able to come to Netflix.
[01:56:58.220 --> 01:56:59.780]   We are going to wrap this up.
[01:56:59.780 --> 01:57:02.420]   Security now is coming up a little later this afternoon.
[01:57:02.420 --> 01:57:03.420]   Tech news today.
[01:57:03.420 --> 01:57:08.340]   It's new time for PM Pacific seven PM Eastern right there at midnight UTC and you're going
[01:57:08.340 --> 01:57:13.580]   to want to watch because we are currently awaiting announcements from Yahoo about what
[01:57:13.580 --> 01:57:15.980]   their plans are according to the Wall Street Journal.
[01:57:15.980 --> 01:57:21.900]   It's expected they will announce that they are exploring strategic alternatives, which
[01:57:21.900 --> 01:57:27.620]   sounds like I don't know what they might be up for sale.
[01:57:27.620 --> 01:57:32.900]   And we talked on the Twitter on Sunday about that with Jason Calick, Anis and he he fully
[01:57:32.900 --> 01:57:35.420]   expected that that was the next thing to happen.
[01:57:35.420 --> 01:57:40.100]   And furthermore, the Twitter might well be acquired in the next few months.
[01:57:40.100 --> 01:57:43.300]   So there's some really interesting stuff happening in tech and tech news today is the
[01:57:43.300 --> 01:57:44.300]   place to tune in.

[01:58:03.660 --> 01:58:04.660]   We don't.
