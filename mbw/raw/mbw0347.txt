[00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:57.280]   Great to see you. This is actually a great opportunity because we're recording this

[00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:07.840]   that great successful success story Apple computer and their profits always higher,
[00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:12.720]   higher, higher. There's no ceiling, baby. Like Wonka's great glass elevator just keeps going
[00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:19.040]   you get the whole chocolate factory baby and that is Tim Cook's inaction. Also with this.
[00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:25.360]   From Cancun. I am so jealous Alex Lindsey. Good to see you Alex.

[00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:26.960]   Pick some core.
[00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:28.160]   Time to get some rears.
[00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:31.120]   You got great a great picture great bandwidth. That's awesome.
[00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:35.440]   We bring I bring the bandwidth with me actually in a suitcase.
[00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:36.080]   In a suitcase.
[00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.560]   The time.
[00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:39.120]   Sometimes it gets lost on the flight which is why I'm not on Mac Break every week.
[00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:41.040]   But but we found it this time.
[00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:43.760]   That's going to be the title of your memoirs right. Suitcase full of bandwidth.
[00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:45.920]   Have bandwidth will travel.
[00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:50.640]   Also with this we're great to glad very glad to have Rich Segal here from Bear Bones software.
[00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:51.520]   One of the preeminent.
[00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:56.800]   Everybody is there with his is that an eclipse coffee coffee milk that you've got there?
[00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:00.800]   Oh no. This is this is just your grand variety Dunkin' Donuts large cup.
[00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:02.080]   Well that that counts also.
[00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:05.040]   He's calling us from Rhode Island.
[00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:07.680]   Home of eclipse coffee and Dunkin' Donuts.
[00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:08.320]   You got both.
[00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:14.080]   He's also the man behind the most amazing Mac software ever one of the original Mac.
[00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:17.840]   Why don't BB edit start? It feels like it's been as round as long as the Mac.
[00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:23.520]   It feels like it some days but actually it was released in 1993 was the first version.
[00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:24.800]   Okay well that's still pretty.
[00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:26.960]   Guess what? Only 20 years old.
[00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:27.760]   20 years ago.
[00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:31.600]   Are you going to have a 20th anniversary party?
[00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:37.600]   Well we we actually had a little a little bit of of a thing last April.
[00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:39.040]   This June.
[00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:41.120]   Sorry actually no it was.
[00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:42.640]   Let me think.
[00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:45.600]   Yeah that's coming up isn't it?
[00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:46.080]   Man.
[00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:46.080]   Yeah.
[00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:46.880]   93.
[00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:47.360]   Yeah.
[00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:48.240]   I'll think of something.
[00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:49.040]   You got to do it.
[00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:50.160]   Well I'll send you flowers.
[00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:50.880]   How about that?
[00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:52.320]   Yeah flowers with the Euler.
[00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:58.560]   We're here to talk today as Andy alluded to as I alluded to to the fact that Apple will make
[00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:07.520]   what most analysts think is it's quarterly analyst call this results a call this afternoon.
[00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:12.000]   The first loss in a long time is that right?
[00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:14.080]   Is that what they're saying?
[00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:14.640]   Is it a loss?
[00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:17.360]   Not a loss but a negative growth.
[00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:23.520]   Right the first the first time in about 10 years that the that this quarter is a profits
[00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:25.360]   are not greater than previous quarters.
[00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:26.320]   Year over year.
[00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:26.720]   Right.
[00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:27.280]   Right.
[00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:29.680]   We're here every quarter quarter year after year.
[00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:33.920]   I think they're they're expecting something like 11 billion and they're going to be only
[00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:40.320]   hats on only making about 8.2 8.3 billion dollars in the for in the quarter that ended in March.
[00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:42.960]   So not a surprise anybody's been watching the stock market apples
[00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:47.280]   shares way way down.
[00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:55.440]   And the price to earnings ratio way way down which led Henry Blodgett at business insider to say
[00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:57.680]   Apple's a great bargain at nine dollars PDE.
[00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:01.840]   Now I don't think first of all we should say there really is a big difference between how
[00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:04.560]   Apple's doing as a company and how Apple's doing in the stock market right?
[00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:07.280]   I'm not a stock.
[00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:07.520]   Yeah.
[00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:07.920]   Yeah.
[00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:08.320]   Yeah.
[00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:09.360]   Exactly.
[00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:11.920]   A lot of times I mean I I guess I really feel like
[00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:17.040]   stock analysts aren't aren't very good at actually measuring what's actually going on.
[00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:18.800]   They're they're good at looking at numbers most of the time.
[00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:22.480]   There are a handful of really good ones that are you know paying attention to what's actually
[00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:26.560]   going on but I mean I'm not saying that Apple's doing well I'm just saying that the stock market
[00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:32.560]   is not a good analysis of what the fact that it was so high it was one side of irrational exuberance.
[00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:32.880]   Right.
[00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:37.600]   And the fact that it's now whatever it is is still it's still pretty not too shabby.
[00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:43.440]   Yeah. It did below 400 which was a lot which is the the law of round numbers says that you have a
[00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:48.320]   party when when a number goes above a certain number of lots of zeros then start to
[00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:52.720]   passing out the shotguns when it goes below a couple of zero numbers.
[00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:55.200]   But the fact of the matter is is there they're still making money hand over
[00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:58.960]   this like I said a profit of profit of eight points something billion dollars a quarter is
[00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:05.760]   exceptionally good compared to how unprofitable HTC is how how limited the profits of Samsung
[00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:10.480]   the other it's really a two it's a two horse race it's Apple and Samsung.
[00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:16.480]   Yeah it's one hand sets absolutely and in and in desktop screen the Apple the bottom line is
[00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:22.160]   that Apple is still very much the master of its own fate. However the problem the only problem
[00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:26.880]   about the stock market that affects Apple and affects Apple consumers is that this is the only
[00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:32.560]   part of human existence in which in which fate has an actual index to it and so that amounts to the
[00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:37.600]   level of faith that the a certain community of very influential people have that Apple is doing
[00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:41.680]   things that are that are okay that are good. So it doesn't necessarily mean that Apple starts
[00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:46.720]   making blenders and kimchi electric electric rice cookers like Samsung next quarter but I think
[00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:50.720]   it does mean that they're going to start to pivot their messaging a little bit to make sure that
[00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:56.720]   the good old days when they were you just get back to a walk-off reference the the factory that
[00:06:56.720 --> 00:07:00.720]   you don't know what happens inside there you don't know what goes on inside there they release a new
[00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:04.560]   product and that's the day that you find out that that new product exists and that's it.
[00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:08.720]   I think that that level of secrecy is no longer going to work for Apple that they need to at least
[00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:14.880]   be a little bit more open as to here's where our strategy is that when when the maps app or when
[00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:20.640]   iCloud or when some other piece of software lays it gets a lot of bad press they people who are
[00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:24.800]   again putting hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars into the company can point to well they
[00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:29.840]   also talked about this strategy that they're rolling out in 2014 so I'm not as inclined to be very
[00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:33.280]   pessimistic as pessimistic as I would have had I thought that this is the only thing they're
[00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:37.280]   really working on so I think that we're going to see some some changes in behavior but not a
[00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:44.800]   change in product line. Rich you want to weigh in? I don't have much to add to what Andy said I
[00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:50.400]   thought his exposition was was pretty complete. Yeah I was really hoping to milk this a little
[00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:58.000]   longer actually. Could you? You know PDE of nine is is by no means bad and I think some of us remember
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:05.760]   the the insane PDEs of the dot com era where you know companies might be trading at 40 or 50 or
[00:08:05.760 --> 00:08:14.080]   100 times their earnings. Yeah I if Apple's profits do in fact level down a bit there are going to be
[00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:19.920]   cries of how doomed they are and I'm thinking yeah no I'd really love to have their problems right now.
[00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:27.920]   But but but I got to say this I mean it's a 40% drop off their peak it's uh the stock market
[00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:33.120]   admittedly is looking at things that maybe others are not looking at but what they're looking at is
[00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:39.600]   Apple's future. I mean you're you're even seeing drumbeats now from people uh saying Tim Cook's gotta
[00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:44.480]   go or maybe even that the board is already thinking about this. Now admittedly some of that
[00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:50.320]   sensationalistic uh but if you thought it was bad now wait till the results come out in about three
[00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:57.120]   hours and if they if their profits are down year over year people are going to make a big deal about
[00:08:57.120 --> 00:09:04.240]   that. Well and I think that's a huge opportunity if it turns out that Apple's working on um you know
[00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:10.720]   so of course the rumors are do we see a TV do we see uh when do you when do you stop being a
[00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:15.760]   pied optimist and start to say hey you know what I'm the most they've lost or we don't know if they
[00:09:15.760 --> 00:09:19.920]   don't if they don't turn something like that over I mean so it's not going to work for them to
[00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:23.520]   because they're not going to continue to make more and more profits year over year releasing the
[00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:27.360]   same products that are now becoming more and more commoditized that's not going to happen so
[00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:32.080]   they have to you know what Apple their their business model has been up to date is to is to
[00:09:32.080 --> 00:09:38.480]   disrupt you know on a very large scale you know in certain industries TV and these you know wearable
[00:09:38.480 --> 00:09:44.480]   devices are probably two uh areas that are have a lot of opportunity um and if Apple actually goes
[00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:48.960]   into that it just may be taking some time for that to actually just state uh if it's not then they've
[00:09:48.960 --> 00:09:53.280]   got some problems but if they uh if it if it does turn out I mean I think a lot of people
[00:09:53.280 --> 00:09:57.760]   are interested in the wearable devices I think that there's a really interesting
[00:09:57.760 --> 00:10:03.120]   possibility when when we look at video when we talk about the Apple TV if Apple decides to go to 4k
[00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:08.160]   with their with their TV and the reason that that's interesting is because the internet actually
[00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:14.720]   has the opportunity to pass TV and film because TV and film have spent billions of dollars on on
[00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:20.800]   uh on HD they're not going to spend billions for another 10 years on on 4k so you're not going to
[00:10:20.800 --> 00:10:27.520]   see 4k in most theaters and probably almost no TV um but YouTube and Amazon and Apple can move
[00:10:27.520 --> 00:10:31.040]   4k anytime they want as long as the monitors are there and we're seeing monitors now dropping to
[00:10:31.040 --> 00:10:37.120]   $5,000 which is starting to get to that point where it starts to open up um and so the you know so
[00:10:37.120 --> 00:10:41.200]   the question is I think I think Apple there is a good chance that Apple could release a TV that
[00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:45.520]   went down that path um and uh and I think there's a good chance that they'll do wearable devices
[00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:49.280]   and I think that that changes a lot and I think that that is also very hard to get right because
[00:10:49.280 --> 00:10:53.040]   it's the first time that it has that it's been there and they and they've had the advantage of not
[00:10:53.040 --> 00:10:57.440]   having to release new things something new and revolutionary because they've constantly just
[00:10:57.440 --> 00:11:04.800]   been you know opening these these cans that were almost you know endless of of revenue uh with the
[00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:08.800]   phone and the and the iPad and the iPod before that um I think that they're in kind of in a
[00:11:08.800 --> 00:11:13.040]   challenging position right now finishing that and I think that yeah it will this will be a very
[00:11:13.040 --> 00:11:16.560]   interesting year I think we're going to see a trajectory this year of either going up or down
[00:11:16.560 --> 00:11:20.480]   and and it's I think it's unclear which way is going to go but I think that those are the unknowns
[00:11:20.480 --> 00:11:23.920]   I think that they sit out in front of us uh if they don't come up with something new and revolutionary
[00:11:23.920 --> 00:11:27.280]   I do think we're going to see all of these I don't think they're going to Apple's going to stop
[00:11:27.280 --> 00:11:32.560]   anytime soon but I think that their growth will level off. Tech columnist Peter Kohann and Forbes
[00:11:32.560 --> 00:11:38.480]   responded to Henry Blodgett's bullish article about Apple to say seven reasons Apple is
[00:11:38.480 --> 00:11:45.600]   more doomed than you think it's worse than you think he says first of all the stock is overpriced
[00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:50.480]   he says that p2e of nine which is is lower than the market average
[00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:57.120]   he's not what you should be looking at you should be uh looking at its earnings growth
[00:11:57.120 --> 00:12:01.200]   that's more important he says and Apple has nothing new in the pipeline he says
[00:12:01.920 --> 00:12:09.920]   into your point Alex Lindsey uh that uh you know yeah the iPhone 5 the iPad mini
[00:12:09.920 --> 00:12:16.000]   are kind of ho hum and he doesn't believe that the tv or the or the watch is going to do anything
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:21.120]   he says without jobs Apple's management has lost the ability to innovate but the most important
[00:12:21.120 --> 00:12:28.400]   thing uh the point he makes I think is that this cheaper iPhone signals that Apple is moving to a
[00:12:28.400 --> 00:12:33.600]   different business model their original business model was they were different think different
[00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:38.240]   they were better they were quality yes they were more expensive but they were better than them
[00:12:38.240 --> 00:12:43.200]   they weren't a mass market product he says the other way to go the other business model is low
[00:12:43.200 --> 00:12:48.560]   cost producer making an adequate product charging customers the lowest price profiting by beating
[00:12:48.560 --> 00:12:53.840]   the competitors price he says Apple is moving away from differentiation to becoming a low
[00:12:53.840 --> 00:12:59.920]   cost provider with his low cost iPhone and they have to because the they've they've the market is
[00:12:59.920 --> 00:13:05.360]   saturated for smartphones in the in the rich world you've got to make inexpensive phones for
[00:13:05.360 --> 00:13:09.440]   the rest of the world well but I think that also though if you look at it Apple did the exact same
[00:13:09.440 --> 00:13:13.520]   thing with the iPod I mean they they had a very expensive iPod that came out first and then they
[00:13:13.520 --> 00:13:17.360]   made sure that there was no oxygen left I mean they they really got that down to anything from
[00:13:17.360 --> 00:13:23.200]   $50 to 500 there was an iPad iPod can they do the same thing with smartphones I think so I mean
[00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:27.520]   especially with the way the the vendor you know people you know they're already doing free
[00:13:27.520 --> 00:13:32.560]   phones I mean essentially you know and so so I definitely you know with with agreements and so
[00:13:32.560 --> 00:13:37.040]   I think that Apple can definitely build that market where you know I think they're giving up a lot
[00:13:37.040 --> 00:13:41.840]   of space and I think that they'd like to stop giving up space to Android because it is important
[00:13:41.840 --> 00:13:45.520]   they have to react to that they can't just ignore that the fact that Android has become
[00:13:45.520 --> 00:13:50.560]   this huge operating system I think that I don't know if the I'm I'm still unsure of
[00:13:51.120 --> 00:13:54.160]   Android's future because I do think it's going to splinter I think that there's a point where
[00:13:54.160 --> 00:13:58.800]   Samsung decides it doesn't really need to be play much you know with everybody else I mean they're
[00:13:58.800 --> 00:14:02.720]   already moving that direction by the way people are saying it's over for Samsung too so that's a
[00:14:02.720 --> 00:14:08.320]   the media loves to say it's over it's over it's over so when I we crown the kings and then we
[00:14:08.320 --> 00:14:12.400]   knock the throne out from under them well it wouldn't be good news otherwise you know if we all if we
[00:14:12.400 --> 00:14:16.000]   all you know said it was just sunny all day so um so we got to worry about something so but I think that
[00:14:16.400 --> 00:14:21.920]   I do think that that Apple does need to continue to to do something disruptive I mean I don't think
[00:14:21.920 --> 00:14:26.560]   that they can they have the type of business model that can just kind of you know cope you
[00:14:26.560 --> 00:14:30.000]   know just kind of even you know even keep on. I agree but that's the question is what can they
[00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:37.040]   do I mean is a watch or a TV disruptive I don't think so oh I do if I may yes I'll go ahead Rich
[00:14:37.040 --> 00:14:43.280]   sort of a couple of thoughts based on what's been going by here the first is I see words like
[00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:50.080]   troubled computer maker and which they're far from obviously and yeah and let's see what's the
[00:14:50.080 --> 00:14:57.040]   other one um struggling, slumping personal computer maker and you know what word I see after those
[00:14:57.040 --> 00:15:04.320]   that word is Dell right Dell by the way is worth more on the stock market than Apple is right now
[00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:09.520]   which tells you some well but see my my take on this is that the only the only thing that will
[00:15:09.520 --> 00:15:14.160]   truly do Apple is if they get themselves into the commodity hardware business and
[00:15:14.160 --> 00:15:17.920]   but they do not a personal computer company anymore are they?
[00:15:17.920 --> 00:15:22.720]   well it doesn't matter what kind of company they are right they're not a person they are
[00:15:22.720 --> 00:15:28.080]   personal computer company but they're not only a personal computer company they're a phone
[00:15:28.080 --> 00:15:34.800]   handset company but they're not only a phone handset company they're a music player company but
[00:15:34.800 --> 00:15:40.880]   they're not only a music player company they cut across a lot of functional lifestyle functional
[00:15:40.880 --> 00:15:48.080]   areas and they you know people talk about how much trouble they're in or how they can't innovate
[00:15:48.080 --> 00:15:56.720]   they're making and selling high margin high profit stuff as fast as they can manufacture it and
[00:15:56.720 --> 00:16:02.960]   will that come to an end it's some point it might right everything does right but who knows what's
[00:16:02.960 --> 00:16:08.240]   going to happen next there's talk about watches and there's talk about TVs and I think a little
[00:16:08.240 --> 00:16:14.800]   bit of that is is projection you know what people would like for them to do or or what experts think
[00:16:14.800 --> 00:16:21.920]   they ought to do or what they could do fact is yeah it it really is like the chocolate factory
[00:16:21.920 --> 00:16:28.000]   you don't know what goes on inside yeah I think that I like the sausage factory but maybe don't
[00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:37.280]   necessarily want to know what goes on inside yeah um right you know my my view on it from the
[00:16:37.280 --> 00:16:42.160]   from the software side of things is they're sort of a similar thing right you know we
[00:16:42.160 --> 00:16:47.680]   look at what what's being offered to us as developers and and there's a lot of talk about what we
[00:16:47.680 --> 00:16:55.040]   would like apple to do or what apple should do but the fact is that apple is going to do what they
[00:16:55.040 --> 00:17:01.040]   believe is best in their own long-term strategic interests and with the way they've been performing
[00:17:01.040 --> 00:17:08.320]   as a business the way they've been performing as a company stock price or not pde or not it's
[00:17:08.320 --> 00:17:14.000]   really very difficult to argue that they've been making any bad moves lately really for a number
[00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:21.920]   of years I don't think if if if if you're if you're bearish on apple and i i'm not i'm not taking
[00:17:21.920 --> 00:17:26.640]   it because one position or another you would be bearish on apple not because they've made any
[00:17:26.640 --> 00:17:31.760]   mistakes but because they've in a way painted themselves into a corner that the market is changing
[00:17:31.760 --> 00:17:37.840]   and this in some ways the success that they've had with the iphone and the ipad is is making it
[00:17:37.840 --> 00:17:43.760]   hard for them to change for the market they can't iterate as fast as the little guys it's the same
[00:17:43.760 --> 00:17:49.360]   thing that happened to microsoft and i don't think anybody's arguing that apple is not doing well
[00:17:49.360 --> 00:17:54.160]   now well some more but that's clearly not but that's not the case they've got a ton of cash
[00:17:54.160 --> 00:18:00.400]   they are still dominant they're activating more uh handsets at least in verizon and probably on all
[00:18:00.400 --> 00:18:07.040]   the u.s. carriers than anybody else um well go ahead and and well and oh it's the future we're
[00:18:07.040 --> 00:18:13.200]   talking about right yeah but apple seems to be undergoing a really good transition so i mean in
[00:18:13.200 --> 00:18:18.880]   terms of for a company that really wants to again maintain their ability to dictate their own
[00:18:18.880 --> 00:18:25.120]   destiny they're not their apple is under no pressure to tack against the winds of consumer
[00:18:25.120 --> 00:18:29.200]   preference they're not uh they don't need to cautout to investors they are really one of the few
[00:18:29.200 --> 00:18:33.680]   companies that can do exactly what they want to do and also they're also in a but in a great
[00:18:33.680 --> 00:18:38.560]   position because they have enough profitability and enough cash on hand that they could fail for a
[00:18:38.560 --> 00:18:44.880]   couple of years you know for if if if if if a disaster is not imminent they can make a lot of
[00:18:44.880 --> 00:18:49.760]   really bad terrible decisions before it becomes okay we have lost our ability to do exactly what
[00:18:49.760 --> 00:18:54.880]   we want to do so that's a very good position but where they're trying to go i think is that they are
[00:18:54.880 --> 00:19:03.040]   trying to uh expand their portfolio into not just hardware that gets 30 to 40 percent margins but
[00:19:03.040 --> 00:19:08.160]   also services so that uh services are like annuities where they don't have to keep coming up with a
[00:19:08.160 --> 00:19:13.840]   brand new phone every single year every every every quarter if they make the video business so
[00:19:13.840 --> 00:19:18.480]   profitable that people are always coming to their video store and always leaving behind a certain
[00:19:18.480 --> 00:19:22.480]   percentage of their money a very purchase into apples coffers of every time they want to buy a
[00:19:22.480 --> 00:19:26.880]   book every time they want to buy a piece of software they're leaving behind 30 cents on the table
[00:19:26.880 --> 00:19:31.200]   out of every single dollar that is like an annuity that every single day makes it makes
[00:19:31.200 --> 00:19:36.320]   profitability without them having to continue to make new engineering breakthroughs create new
[00:19:36.320 --> 00:19:40.640]   quote disruptive unquote technologies and stuff like that which is why i think that a lot of the
[00:19:40.640 --> 00:19:45.040]   stuff that they're going to be doing in the future is going to be things like the the rumored deal
[00:19:45.040 --> 00:19:50.160]   about uh doing a streaming radio service that uh has deals with all of the uh all the music companies
[00:19:50.160 --> 00:19:55.760]   and things like the long long long long rumored deals that they're trying to broker with cable
[00:19:55.760 --> 00:20:01.360]   companies and networks to be one of the first companies that can without any legal objection
[00:20:01.360 --> 00:20:07.200]   from the networks stream content directly to consumers through uh through cable connections
[00:20:07.200 --> 00:20:11.680]   those are again annuity sort of things and when i think that when they start coming out with things
[00:20:11.680 --> 00:20:16.400]   like if they come up the watch if they come up with the tv set yes those will be well they'll be
[00:20:16.400 --> 00:20:22.480]   a huge huge influx of cash but as Alex sort of said there all of these new devices come in waves
[00:20:22.480 --> 00:20:27.840]   where they can't sell them as fast as they can make them and they're making again 35 to 40 percent
[00:20:27.840 --> 00:20:31.520]   on each one of these pieces of hardware but as new companies get into the game
[00:20:33.200 --> 00:20:36.880]   consumers start to fail to see why they should be going with an apple product instead of a
[00:20:36.880 --> 00:20:41.280]   samsung or instead of a another nameplate where they have more choice and lower prices
[00:20:41.280 --> 00:20:47.040]   but and so that's why they really need to make sure that the the the get of that watch isn't this
[00:20:47.040 --> 00:20:51.440]   one specific watch it's all the services that you get with that watch if they do like a micro
[00:20:51.440 --> 00:20:57.360]   payment if they do an electronic payment service that's tied to ios that is so easy to do if you're
[00:20:57.360 --> 00:21:02.000]   using an apple watch or an apple iphone and now they're starting to get like credit card style
[00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:06.640]   transaction fees off of those things those are other variants of what we call what you'd call
[00:21:06.640 --> 00:21:12.640]   annuities i think that apple is starting to see the wisdom of trying to get off the the
[00:21:12.640 --> 00:21:17.200]   the distro the technology disruptor treadmill where every four years they have to come up with
[00:21:17.200 --> 00:21:23.040]   something that knocks the entire industry on its butt nobody can guess that way of for more than
[00:21:23.040 --> 00:21:29.600]   10 or 15 years if they if they go into 2015 2016 2017 with the ability to still come up with that
[00:21:29.600 --> 00:21:34.320]   device that causes the entire industry to have to restructure itself to accommodate it
[00:21:34.320 --> 00:21:40.960]   that will be something akin to a miracle yeah so when this afternoon they report if they do report
[00:21:40.960 --> 00:21:49.840]   uh falling um profits lowered margins uh and the world goes crazy because they will it's all over
[00:21:49.840 --> 00:21:53.920]   for apple that's a great story for the media your your advice all of you would be just
[00:21:55.520 --> 00:22:01.600]   stay cool let it be let it be let it be let it be let it be let it be there was the words it was
[00:22:01.600 --> 00:22:06.000]   i i should be if you have the spare cash by apple when the stock price drops because
[00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:11.440]   it's a great opportunity but that's that's a question what what is the natural price for apple
[00:22:11.440 --> 00:22:16.560]   stock because when it was really cool seeing them you know break seven hundred but i think that
[00:22:16.560 --> 00:22:21.680]   you'd have to be the most turbo fanboy to think that that's exactly where apple apple
[00:22:21.680 --> 00:22:26.880]   stock price should be and that can only go up from there like i i don't think the price is
[00:22:26.880 --> 00:22:31.040]   crashing crashing i think it's sort of finding a more reasonable level i think we're gonna say
[00:22:31.040 --> 00:22:36.560]   right here that we that we are not giving you stock advice no and you've known i'd say you'd be
[00:22:36.560 --> 00:22:42.640]   nuts to follow our stock advice even if we were and then if you want to if you want to buy apple
[00:22:42.640 --> 00:22:49.200]   stock and you can blame rich but that's you know that's why the stock market is not is a different
[00:22:49.200 --> 00:22:55.120]   game you're playing a different beast it's about expectations world's biggest and longest faith-based
[00:22:55.120 --> 00:23:00.080]   initiative yeah i agree i mean i i think the game it's it's not that much you know i think a lot of
[00:23:00.080 --> 00:23:03.840]   times it's not that much i mean let's some people are very good gamblers and so you can be very good
[00:23:03.840 --> 00:23:07.120]   at that kind of thing but you are there's a lot of variables right i think it's
[00:23:07.120 --> 00:23:12.320]   so we're not we're not making any recommendations and we don't know i don't know
[00:23:12.320 --> 00:23:18.000]   any stock apple stock until it goes back down below twenty you know see if you'd bought it then you'd
[00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:24.320]   you'd be still be happy right i remember a co-worker saying it's a 13 or you know should i should i
[00:23:24.320 --> 00:23:30.480]   buy oh yeah and i was like and i said yes and i really wish i had i had to 13 time i had no money
[00:23:30.480 --> 00:23:37.760]   yes 13 i was eating rice in a basement shimmy is it by apple stock yeah sure sure whatever
[00:23:37.760 --> 00:23:46.800]   i was calling friends um all right i mean there's the controversy in a nutshell uh
[00:23:47.600 --> 00:23:54.400]   apple is doomed apples not doomed um doomed seems like such a strong word i wouldn't say doomed but
[00:23:54.400 --> 00:23:59.920]   i i have to say i wonder if apple's lost its mojo um if and by the way for those who are calling
[00:23:59.920 --> 00:24:03.520]   for tim cooks ouster and i don't think it's very many that's that's ridiculous who do you replace
[00:24:03.520 --> 00:24:09.200]   him with there's no steve jobs waiting in the wings or maybe johnny i don't i don't know who you
[00:24:09.200 --> 00:24:13.760]   replace him with the job of a ceo is very different than that of a designer i mean i think the only
[00:24:13.760 --> 00:24:18.880]   thing if it's something that that uh that steve brought that i think may not be there now is
[00:24:18.880 --> 00:24:22.320]   you know someone running around yelling at people telling them to get get it done it's him
[00:24:22.320 --> 00:24:26.720]   doesn't seem like a a yeller although i'm told he might be he might be i just can't imagine him you
[00:24:26.720 --> 00:24:31.680]   know like you know i'm totally give you i'm totally give you pretty forceful i've i feel
[00:24:31.680 --> 00:24:36.880]   instinctively i feel as though he's not a yeller he's more of uh he puts a black gloved hand on a
[00:24:36.880 --> 00:24:41.760]   chrome just like levered next to his chair and everybody starts to wonder are there trap doors
[00:24:41.760 --> 00:24:47.360]   in our chairs and that's how he gets things done but i i think i think rich really was spot on
[00:24:47.360 --> 00:24:52.960]   there i mean can you point to something specific that an opportunity that tim cook had but missed
[00:24:52.960 --> 00:24:57.440]   a mistake that he made at place where he should have zay drew zag you really can't find that it's
[00:24:57.440 --> 00:25:01.200]   yeah it's it's ridiculous the idea of replacing him at this juncture is absolutely ridiculous
[00:25:01.200 --> 00:25:06.960]   and i and who knows how uh you know this is the problem that we live in now with twitter and
[00:25:07.840 --> 00:25:11.520]   and uh the internet it you know if there's somebody could say something and suddenly it
[00:25:11.520 --> 00:25:18.320]   it gains a life of its own um although we've you know i think we have talked about this
[00:25:18.320 --> 00:25:23.680]   like well what would you do next i'm not i am not in your camp at all alex lindsey being bullish
[00:25:23.680 --> 00:25:29.280]   that apple making a new tv or a new watch is going to have a market there i understand i
[00:25:29.280 --> 00:25:35.040]   understand it's attempting it and you know i'm wearing a pebble watch uh you know i and you really
[00:25:35.040 --> 00:25:38.720]   think and you really think your pebble watch would be better than than apple would do as a well
[00:25:38.720 --> 00:25:42.800]   no uh maybe apple do something magical magically wonderful but i don't see what it would be
[00:25:42.800 --> 00:25:48.800]   i don't think the world's dying to buy new wristwatches or new tv well i mean i i just i think we just
[00:25:48.800 --> 00:25:54.080]   we're getting used to having things i mean and the and the tv you know is one thing i i i
[00:25:54.080 --> 00:25:58.880]   i'm i'm looking for new tv right now and i'm just kind of now i'm holding pat well i also admit i
[00:25:58.880 --> 00:26:04.800]   i have a tv that deserves to be replaced that i have not replaced just in case see see
[00:26:04.800 --> 00:26:11.680]   yeah but the whole process of i mean you know i have a you know i have i have a great watch you
[00:26:11.680 --> 00:26:19.520]   know that i that i love that took me a long time to find um and and i would uh um and i would replace
[00:26:19.520 --> 00:26:23.840]   it you know heartbeat i'm looking at actually a lot of our audience we have about eight people in the
[00:26:23.840 --> 00:26:29.280]   studio audience and a lot of them are wearing watches which surprises me um because i thought
[00:26:29.280 --> 00:26:35.680]   watches were dead your phone tells the time right Alex my phone does tell the time but but it does
[00:26:35.680 --> 00:26:39.520]   you know i i don't care i don't i don't have it in front of me all the time and i can't look up at
[00:26:39.520 --> 00:26:44.960]   it and and you know it's it's uh doesn't you know anyway so by the way it is kind of cool
[00:26:44.960 --> 00:26:49.840]   to have a watch i mean this is what people learned from with a nano watch to have a programmable
[00:26:49.840 --> 00:26:54.320]   watch face is kind of cool and having and i do kind of like it when text messages come in
[00:26:54.320 --> 00:26:58.880]   my watch tells me it's with the phone call it tells me who's calling and go like oh i don't
[00:26:58.880 --> 00:27:02.720]   want to take that imagine it'd be like siri what's the weather and then you're like siri to remind me
[00:27:02.720 --> 00:27:06.160]   of this well that would be interesting you think that they may put siri in the watch i guess i
[00:27:06.160 --> 00:27:09.200]   could oh yeah i definitely give siri i think you have to have siri in the watch i don't think that
[00:27:09.200 --> 00:27:15.120]   works the other way and and so then and i and i siri what time is it i don't know about siri remember
[00:27:15.120 --> 00:27:19.440]   the siri requires a connection to a network if if we're acting something if we're fine
[00:27:19.440 --> 00:27:23.200]   if we're exactly if we're acting simply as a conduit to the phone if that feels our microphone
[00:27:23.200 --> 00:27:27.280]   so that right yeah i'm sure it maybe you i mean this pebble watch doesn't work with an i-phone or
[00:27:27.280 --> 00:27:31.680]   an android phone you got to have a phone maybe you're saying this should be a phone and watch and
[00:27:31.680 --> 00:27:37.840]   everything yes hello no i don't know if it needs to be i don't know if it needs to be
[00:27:37.840 --> 00:27:42.800]   uh and the question you wouldn't be this most likely it would be more like for those listening at home
[00:27:42.800 --> 00:27:46.960]   we're taking our watch we're particularly crazy and putting it in the north and the
[00:27:46.960 --> 00:27:52.880]   warrior the noor mouth and the warrior it's not a galaxy i like so i mean i can't i can't remember
[00:27:52.880 --> 00:27:57.680]   the last time i saw someone in public wearing a bluetooth headset it's like you know why because
[00:27:57.680 --> 00:28:02.880]   it was sok they you know they really you're not being one to see you you don't see those anymore
[00:28:02.880 --> 00:28:09.280]   once a year i see the blue tooth head said once a year i buy a bluetooth headset to try it again
[00:28:09.280 --> 00:28:14.080]   like have they actually got this working and the answer is never it is kind of like michael dugless
[00:28:14.080 --> 00:28:19.840]   in wall street isn't it to have it and i think it's not really universe i just i just i just don't
[00:28:19.840 --> 00:28:24.560]   like all the clicking and the weird phasing and all the audio problems i mean that's the that's the
[00:28:24.560 --> 00:28:32.160]   issue with the bluetooth stinks right so this watch is going to be bluetooth though right or you
[00:28:32.160 --> 00:28:36.080]   think you'll have some magical non-blue no i mean i i don't know i mean it'd be great to have the
[00:28:36.080 --> 00:28:41.120]   pebbles bluetooth created a new protocol that actually worked you know and and the worst part is is
[00:28:41.120 --> 00:28:45.600]   that the well that's what we need apple to create a new protocol well somebody created one here's
[00:28:45.600 --> 00:28:48.880]   the deal here's the here's the deal is actually they don't have to create a new protocol all they
[00:28:48.880 --> 00:28:53.280]   need to do is they need to use the pro the other bluetooth protocol that audio uses so the thing
[00:28:53.280 --> 00:28:58.400]   is is that we have phones have this crappy you know bluetooth you know implementation and
[00:28:58.400 --> 00:29:03.920]   professional audio actually has another implementation of bluetooth that actually works you know for
[00:29:03.920 --> 00:29:09.600]   you know a lot longer distances and higher quality and everything else and but it's not you know
[00:29:09.600 --> 00:29:13.520]   compatible with all the current headsets because they picked the cheap crappy one
[00:29:13.520 --> 00:29:18.720]   Alex Lindsey from pixacore is here from beautiful cancun from Providence Rhode Island
[00:29:18.720 --> 00:29:24.640]   rich seagull of bare bones software and from a mysterious place in Massachusetts we never really

[00:32:47.920 --> 00:32:52.320]   android you know eclipsing the iphone in some ways and i have to say that one is very much like
[00:32:52.320 --> 00:32:58.880]   an iphone it's a unibody aluminum it's um it's it's it's never an awful thing to have a phone that
[00:32:58.880 --> 00:33:04.000]   looks and feels great in the hand yeah and this one and i hope apple takes notice and i'm sure they
[00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:09.520]   do even though they probably wouldn't admit it has speakers left and right in the front yeah so the
[00:33:09.520 --> 00:33:16.080]   sound is really uh you know is like sound uh there it is there's the close up of that
[00:33:16.080 --> 00:33:24.080]   anyway um apple uh is sending you checks for 15 dollars did you
[00:33:24.080 --> 00:33:32.640]   like i you know i feel so sorry for apple so and tenigate right uh if you had an iphone 4
[00:33:34.240 --> 00:33:39.840]   and uh you complained you actually had to go file a claim in which you would state in the claim
[00:33:39.840 --> 00:33:50.720]   that you had experienced the sudden loss of a call or the drop of a signal that you were unwilling
[00:33:50.720 --> 00:34:00.960]   for some reason to get a bumper you actually have to say that um that you uh that you just
[00:34:00.960 --> 00:34:04.160]   could try to other things whatever then you had to file a claim
[00:34:04.160 --> 00:34:11.200]   this is a response to a class action lawsuit and apple is now sending out checks for the vast
[00:34:11.200 --> 00:34:19.280]   amount of 15 dollars to make you whole burrito and a beer i don't know i'd feel better the first
[00:34:19.280 --> 00:34:23.360]   checks were issued april 17th they're void after the lys 16th so don't wait for that burrito and
[00:34:23.360 --> 00:34:31.680]   beer go get it um you can't submit a claim anymore by the way 53 million dollars in this settlement
[00:34:31.680 --> 00:34:40.480]   total amount to apple paid out lawyers took 16 million up to 53 million dollars braid kelly
[00:34:40.480 --> 00:34:45.920]   tweeted by iphone settlement check is here buying a boat and sailing the world thanks lawyers
[00:34:47.040 --> 00:34:53.680]   with a bicketer of a 15 dollar check he only got four retweets on that oh no 27 retweets four
[00:34:53.680 --> 00:35:02.480]   favorites okay i'll retweet it um so wait for you any of you file that's so silly i feel sorry
[00:35:02.480 --> 00:35:10.080]   for apple this is stupid yeah that's stupid yep yep no only the only the lawyers won that one yeah
[00:35:10.080 --> 00:35:15.200]   and they won a lot well what happens so there's a pool of money so subtract whatever the lawyers
[00:35:15.200 --> 00:35:20.880]   got 16 million for 53 million that leaves what 30 37 million dollars just remember you're getting
[00:35:20.880 --> 00:35:25.840]   a 15 dollar check and they're getting a 16 million dollar check let me just do a little math because
[00:35:25.840 --> 00:35:34.880]   37 million dollars divided by 15 easy Leo easy that's a that's a lot of uh 30 30 37
[00:35:35.520 --> 00:35:43.440]   zero zero zero zero zero zero divided by 15 means that uh 200
[00:35:43.440 --> 00:35:52.160]   2.4 million people are going to get those checks if my math is correct if my apple calculator is correct
[00:35:52.160 --> 00:36:01.680]   2.4666666666 million people are going to get checks what no they're not i bet if it's a thousand
[00:36:01.680 --> 00:36:08.000]   i'll be shocked for 15 dollars who's going to fill out that whole thing yeah but it's an interesting
[00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:13.040]   symbolic gesture that they were sort of forced to say we were wrong about the design of this symbol
[00:36:13.040 --> 00:36:17.760]   yeah and the and the and the only and really the only way that a company can say yes we were wrong
[00:36:17.760 --> 00:36:22.960]   is by at some point getting running a check for whatever amount uh and then yeah but you're right
[00:36:22.960 --> 00:36:29.680]   in terms of adequate what what would be adequate redress i mean how many how as somebody really
[00:36:29.680 --> 00:36:35.120]   able to write a letter with an affidavit saying that i i've been an independent farmer in Indiana
[00:36:35.120 --> 00:36:41.280]   that the hen stopped laying my best producers what was your real damages yeah exactly i mean it was
[00:36:41.280 --> 00:36:47.920]   a i i have said before that uh it was an it was embarrassing incident not necessarily because of
[00:36:47.920 --> 00:36:52.480]   the fault but because of apple's reaction to the fault which was like oh stop whining you babies
[00:36:52.480 --> 00:36:57.280]   it's a beautiful phone and if the and and i can't believe that you're making such a big deal out of
[00:36:57.280 --> 00:37:01.920]   the fact that the signal strength indicator goes from five to one if you hold it normally okay if
[00:37:01.920 --> 00:37:06.880]   you're gonna be a baby about it fine here's a rubber band go shut up uh but but but but that was
[00:37:06.880 --> 00:37:12.320]   by the way pretty much a response it was i mean it was it was really embarrassing i i not being
[00:37:12.320 --> 00:37:15.840]   i'm not being sarcastic that i was a little bit embarrassed for rappled and they that's the way
[00:37:15.840 --> 00:37:20.640]   they chose to do it but that but that said it's not as though they were selling defective phones that
[00:37:20.640 --> 00:37:26.240]   failed to work it was just an embarrassing defect that they would have if they had the option of
[00:37:26.240 --> 00:37:29.840]   simply saying okay we're gonna stop selling these of course they didn't have that option
[00:37:29.840 --> 00:37:35.280]   they would have just simply quietly not not really admitted anything was wrong but quietly there'd
[00:37:35.280 --> 00:37:39.360]   been a there would be a revision be very quickly that didn't have that problem associated with it
[00:37:39.360 --> 00:37:43.200]   right uh but the the idea that there was a lot of fault on both sides both apple and their
[00:37:43.200 --> 00:37:48.720]   inability to really acknowledge there was a problem but also in the in the the the appillation of the
[00:37:48.720 --> 00:37:55.920]   the suffix gate to this this was really not quite so much as a scandal or disgrace as the most powerful
[00:37:55.920 --> 00:38:01.040]   person in the entire planet using the power of his office to execute political and personal
[00:38:01.040 --> 00:38:06.000]   vendettas that upset the balance of democracy uh for in the entire western half of the planet wait
[00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:13.200]   was a jar hold on working for apple at the time yeah yeah allen kay was deep throat uh
[00:38:13.200 --> 00:38:22.960]   i'm sorry didn't mean it derail your no no completely astute uh it isn't a gate it's it's just a little
[00:38:22.960 --> 00:38:28.560]   bit of an embarrassing footnote but but not a gate that's that's it i mean again i'm a i'm a
[00:38:28.560 --> 00:38:32.880]   print journalist and about in a swiftly collapsing market of free beer and a free burrito are things
[00:38:32.880 --> 00:38:39.600]   that i would like uh so oh well window closed once again and you know i guess you blew it you could
[00:38:39.600 --> 00:38:43.360]   have you took the bumper see as soon as you took the bumper what you didn't realize is you were
[00:38:43.360 --> 00:38:49.040]   foregoing the fifteen dollars i was able to be able to burn the bumper for heat during that
[00:38:49.040 --> 00:38:54.160]   type when we had last year so it's not going to total lose now this is a pure rumor i think and i
[00:38:54.160 --> 00:39:01.520]   think not a true one apple returned eight million iPhones for defects to fox con this coming from
[00:39:01.520 --> 00:39:10.160]   the register based on a translation of a translation from a translation of china business uh an anonymous
[00:39:10.160 --> 00:39:17.440]   fox con staffer charnet chatting to china business uh said that apple sent back at least i don't know
[00:39:17.440 --> 00:39:21.680]   how this gets to be eight million at least five million phones and as many as maybe as many as
[00:39:21.680 --> 00:39:27.920]   eight million due to appearance of substandard or dysfunctional problems not do you think that's
[00:39:27.920 --> 00:39:34.000]   even halfway credible that would be that would be a significant amount of money i heard a rumor
[00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:38.320]   that i guess when they when they released the new track these new uh track pads that are in all
[00:39:38.320 --> 00:39:44.400]   of our mac mac pros uh the rumor i heard was is that the the failure rate the failure rate on those
[00:39:44.400 --> 00:39:48.320]   track pads because the the way that they that they were built to the spec that apple needed was like
[00:39:48.320 --> 00:39:53.280]   forty percent so i mean you know the thing is is that apple has this the tolerance is that apple
[00:39:53.280 --> 00:39:59.680]   requires uh you know a lot of their stuff to work inside of is is intense you know and i think that
[00:39:59.680 --> 00:40:03.840]   i i could see it definitely see a lot of failures so in the christmas quarter apple sold almost 50
[00:40:03.840 --> 00:40:08.880]   million iPhones let's assume it sold another 50 million in one of but let's say so we're talking
[00:40:08.880 --> 00:40:14.000]   eight percent failure rate somewhere around there that's a high failure rate but not unbelievable
[00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:19.600]   no this from i'm sorry i wasn't clear if it was from consumers getting back or apple just kicking
[00:40:19.600 --> 00:40:24.080]   them back apple kicking the back yeah yeah yeah no i i totally believe that really
[00:40:24.080 --> 00:40:30.400]   yeah those phones didn't necessarily end up in stores but perhaps apple's own
[00:40:30.400 --> 00:40:35.200]   internal qa said this isn't right well you open the container and you take out a few
[00:40:35.200 --> 00:40:38.800]   phones and you look at them and they they look like they're made out of clay and you go no i
[00:40:38.800 --> 00:40:42.240]   should send that container back i don't know how you would look at eight million phones
[00:40:42.240 --> 00:40:48.720]   um but i'm presuming this is not from consumers that this is because we haven't seen any information
[00:40:48.720 --> 00:40:52.320]   about it then we have another class action and there'd be another twenty-one dollars there hasn't
[00:40:52.320 --> 00:40:57.120]   been anywhere near that kind of failure return rate for iPhones i'm i'm pretty sure of that i don't
[00:40:57.120 --> 00:41:03.760]   know anybody's return an iPhone for problems all right the and by the way the cost for that
[00:41:03.760 --> 00:41:09.600]   it doesn't go to apple goes to foxconn it'll be a sub of significant loss more than a billion
[00:41:09.600 --> 00:41:14.480]   dollar loss to uh to them so you know we'll probably know at some point i don't know do they
[00:41:14.480 --> 00:41:24.240]   have to report their uh their p&l not to us hey foxconn do you lose money this year
[00:41:24.240 --> 00:41:29.440]   we're going to take a break again because uh i'm looking for something interesting to say
[00:41:31.120 --> 00:41:36.400]   and i don't see it do you see anything in here it's kind of a slow period right now
[00:41:36.400 --> 00:41:40.560]   there's there's no new products we're waiting for the quarterly results
[00:41:40.560 --> 00:41:44.960]   the stock the reason we make such a big deal about the stock prices that's all there is to talk about
[00:41:44.960 --> 00:41:50.320]   chatroom is there a big story that we are not we are missing twitter music
[00:41:50.320 --> 00:41:56.800]   well the industry was really quiet last week yeah yeah i'm really sick of the iPhone versus
[00:41:56.800 --> 00:42:05.120]   android who's winning debate yeah this is this is an iPhone and android market and and that's just
[00:42:05.120 --> 00:42:09.760]   cheap stupid rah rah red flag versus blue flag fighting that's no one should care about i'm a
[00:42:09.760 --> 00:42:15.680]   little bummed that tweet deck is the twitter is killing tweet deck not just on ios but the uh
[00:42:15.680 --> 00:42:22.000]   desktop version and the android version it'll stop working may seventh twitter bought tweet deck
[00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:26.640]   it kind of in a preemptive strike to keep bill gross from creating a twitter competitor he was
[00:42:26.640 --> 00:42:32.000]   buying up uh his ideal lab was buying up uh twitter clients and they paid a lot of money for it
[00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:37.200]   and uh i guess they didn't really want it so tweet deck is going away a lot of people loved
[00:42:37.200 --> 00:42:42.640]   tweet deck anybody here use that on the desktop with the columns it was the first one i have the
[00:42:42.640 --> 00:42:49.360]   you know timeline mentions direct messages searches different accounts all in columns i had
[00:42:49.360 --> 00:42:52.720]   for i use it for a while and then when i when i had opened too long i was like what am i doing
[00:42:52.720 --> 00:42:58.000]   with my life yeah then i i said twitter needs to be somewhere not in the middle yeah needs to be
[00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:02.720]   somewhere to the side that's that's where i stepped away but that doesn't indicate that there's that
[00:43:02.720 --> 00:43:06.800]   there's that segment of the twitter user base that really does use it as a communic as a professional
[00:43:06.800 --> 00:43:10.880]   communications tool obviously not as a private thing but they really do need to have those multiple
[00:43:10.880 --> 00:43:15.840]   columns because they want to find out what kind of action the topics are getting uh they need to
[00:43:15.840 --> 00:43:20.560]   maintain their own PR their own marketing and so it's that's not that's not a large part of the
[00:43:20.560 --> 00:43:24.640]   twitter base by by far but there needs to be those sort of tools because those are the people who
[00:43:24.640 --> 00:43:31.520]   uh mlb.com is uh is pushing out information to a lot of people that and that makes twitter a
[00:43:31.520 --> 00:43:35.760]   lot more valuable so if they don't give like power tools to people who make twitter into a more
[00:43:35.760 --> 00:43:41.200]   valuable service than just you know snapshots of breakfast to to your iran sati then they're
[00:43:41.200 --> 00:43:46.080]   gonna start to lose some traction with other people yeah it's it's amazing i mean that that's a small
[00:43:46.080 --> 00:43:52.320]   version of it actually they i i i was talking to a social manager for a broadcast company and that's
[00:43:52.320 --> 00:43:57.120]   all she does and she's it is incredible the tools that these companies have to manage
[00:43:57.120 --> 00:44:02.080]   you know the the ones that are paying attention to manage their social uh exposure you know they
[00:44:02.080 --> 00:44:07.520]   have ones that tweet like look at all of their users and find out when their users are most active
[00:44:07.520 --> 00:44:12.880]   on twitter and then see that you can write a tweet and have it go into a queue waiting for that spike
[00:44:12.880 --> 00:44:18.160]   you know so that they're actually opened and looking at it when they when they see it it's
[00:44:18.160 --> 00:44:25.840]   crazy thing has anybody watched the funnier die 78 minute parody i steve no i couldn't find any
[00:44:25.840 --> 00:44:31.520]   you watched it all 78 minutes Chad not all 78 minutes but that's because it was 3 a.m and here
[00:44:31.520 --> 00:44:36.160]   let's watch let's just watch a little bit of the this is the beginning just in long as
[00:44:36.160 --> 00:44:43.360]   steve jobs rehearsing as a frugal gourmet yeah it does look like the frugal the janitor comes in
[00:44:43.360 --> 00:44:49.840]   says mr jobs doing all this late yeah no he does like he said i don't know why i'm not getting audio
[00:44:49.840 --> 00:44:55.520]   but that's usually the case with my stupid laptop but uh he said it and and just in long
[00:44:55.520 --> 00:45:00.800]   says i'm rehearsing for my keynote tomorrow so it's a story within a story that's what you said four
[00:45:00.800 --> 00:45:07.600]   hours ago you have watched it yeah no it's all i didn't watch and in in the real like 180 million
[00:45:07.600 --> 00:45:12.240]   dollar big budget version that would be played by Morgan Freeman right you know something steve
[00:45:12.240 --> 00:45:20.400]   when if we think back to who we were when we was 17 we figure out who we are today and who we ever
[00:45:20.400 --> 00:45:29.440]   will be that's that's the speech we want now they'd obviously spent no money on sets and this
[00:45:29.440 --> 00:45:34.160]   reminds me of of yeah a college um theater production black box it's a black box the
[00:45:34.160 --> 00:45:39.520]   production of iced tea yeah and then and then he goes oh oh you had a question and then there's like
[00:45:39.520 --> 00:45:46.480]   a ding of like the response from the user and then he answers the you know it's like yeah it's just
[00:45:46.480 --> 00:45:49.280]   a single monologue and i'll tell you the real reason we're not playing the audio we don't want
[00:45:49.280 --> 00:45:55.680]   this entire show to be pulled off the right off the air by youtube um for for there's definitely
[00:45:55.680 --> 00:46:03.520]   some funny moments uh that they they continuously just come bash on wasniac i mean just yeah no one
[00:46:03.520 --> 00:46:08.400]   loves him that's good that's funny because everybody loves was so that's right right and so and they'll
[00:46:08.400 --> 00:46:15.040]   be like he's up to like say a speech and they're like boog it up to bring on steve come on here's
[00:46:15.040 --> 00:46:21.120]   the here's the original by the way this is that was right there no that is bill gates and so apparently
[00:46:21.120 --> 00:46:26.960]   when i want audio i want audio i don't i don't run with my computer wish we could we can't figure it out
[00:46:26.960 --> 00:46:35.920]   so i'm gonna shut my oh here's was here's was i like this and so was is hurley from right lost from
[00:46:35.920 --> 00:46:42.160]   lost big here and there is this place that kind of looks like was yeah it kind of looks like was
[00:46:42.160 --> 00:46:47.840]   right um oh so they're suggesting i use a line in you know i'm i'm putting that that clip suddenly
[00:46:47.840 --> 00:46:52.320]   makes me think that they should whoever's the next person to do like a steve jon steve jobs
[00:46:52.320 --> 00:46:57.360]   movie they need to hire juda free lander as bill work that won't work you know why that won't work
[00:46:57.360 --> 00:47:03.520]   because i got an hdmi cable in here well if you just switch to my cable or no leo i think that's good
[00:47:03.520 --> 00:47:11.440]   casting i think you know i wasn't talking about when i cast like you're right when i cast i often
[00:47:11.440 --> 00:47:18.000]   ask myself is it going to be sdi or hdmi or is it going to be uh rca cables i mean if it's going to
[00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:24.560]   be analog there's a whole set of i like the way they age jobs because just in long they he's this is
[00:47:24.560 --> 00:47:30.480]   you know when he's young right so he's clean shaven and they age him just by gluing a gray beard and
[00:47:30.480 --> 00:47:37.200]   making his hair gray yeah i i don't even need to know the dialogue that's that's how you know the
[00:47:37.200 --> 00:47:41.600]   budget of a movie if they don't pay the actor enough to get a haircut for this role yeah you know
[00:47:41.600 --> 00:47:45.600]   it's a low budget there's there's i want to see if we can get the picture of the apple one in here
[00:47:45.600 --> 00:47:51.440]   because uh there's here's gates that's bill gates uh you did watch it you did watch but yeah yeah
[00:47:51.440 --> 00:47:56.240]   and it's funny so right now they're at the at the computer club um right uh and looking at the
[00:47:56.240 --> 00:48:01.200]   original apple right there it is right oh and so you can see steve or uh wasne act called in out his
[00:48:01.200 --> 00:48:07.040]   hand bill gates comes up and goes i want to shake the hand of the man who made this computer and
[00:48:07.040 --> 00:48:11.840]   then steve jobs holds out his hand and he shakes only steve jobs hand and then wasne act is just
[00:48:11.840 --> 00:48:18.960]   standing there for the rest of the time with his hand out waiting to get shaken oh and it's in every
[00:48:18.960 --> 00:48:28.320]   frame it's just hilarious i like that poor poor for for wasne so they paint steve as a god in this
[00:48:28.320 --> 00:48:33.920]   oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah it's comedy was was just a guy yeah absolutely so this is when they're building
[00:48:33.920 --> 00:48:41.920]   the apple one why is no one watch this no one i know is watch the technology back then
[00:48:41.920 --> 00:48:48.480]   they're going they're not knowing the key which is which are not created until 1984
[00:48:48.480 --> 00:48:54.240]   i can't wait to see i am db like you know
[00:48:54.240 --> 00:49:03.840]   it's better with that sound it is it's like it's like yeah absolutely yeah and so they describe
[00:49:03.840 --> 00:49:08.000]   people who have seen the apple and there's there's a whole bunch of people that are like this is a
[00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:13.840]   lot of yummy a famous comedian right yeah i mean there's one person like this is the most amazing
[00:49:13.840 --> 00:49:19.760]   thing i've ever seen and she reaches down and and grabs the apple that's sitting on the table
[00:49:19.760 --> 00:49:25.520]   instead of the actual computer yeah you know what this might be i hate to say it it might actually
[00:49:25.520 --> 00:49:29.760]   be better than the alleyway the problem is is that's really better than the ash the kutcher version
[00:49:29.760 --> 00:49:34.720]   right the problem is is that from someone who's a complete layman you don't know where fact and
[00:49:34.720 --> 00:49:40.080]   and fiction but what this tell is how much these guys are funny or die who are pretty savvy
[00:49:40.080 --> 00:49:44.400]   expect people to know the mythology they expected you to know the legend otherwise it's not funny
[00:49:44.400 --> 00:49:47.760]   right and then i think we do know that i think everybody knows the legend now
[00:49:47.760 --> 00:49:56.000]   and the more will once that eris erin sorkin movie comes out all right we're gonna take a break

[00:54:07.360 --> 00:54:16.400]   with the with the beetle have been good and cool enough for him to like put it into the keynote
[00:54:16.400 --> 00:54:20.800]   oh yeah or they even said would they insist that no we're going to need to you make something with
[00:54:20.800 --> 00:54:27.440]   three pinstripes not four not two we're going to need one dot that's orange but the right kind of
[00:54:27.440 --> 00:54:33.200]   orange on the hood he approves the Motorola rocker i would say that that's his head a good shot i don't
[00:54:33.200 --> 00:54:40.080]   i don't know i i remember that announcement i remember it being the most well and we signed a deal with
[00:54:40.080 --> 00:54:45.280]   a company that did something and i'm i'm going to leave the stage and let the person responsible
[00:54:45.280 --> 00:54:50.080]   or product talk about this piece of crap he will tell you what his name is i never bought the
[00:54:50.080 --> 00:54:55.520]   to learn he even mentioned the guy's name wow and then as he's talking you hear like microwave popcorn
[00:54:55.520 --> 00:55:04.000]   being cooked backstage so the i beetle and they an apple worked with vox wagon on this
[00:55:04.000 --> 00:55:10.720]   designed in coordination according to vw with apple boasts integration with the iphone through
[00:55:10.720 --> 00:55:16.480]   get ready for it the i beetle app when the app is launched it can either connect the iphone to the
[00:55:16.480 --> 00:55:23.040]   beetle docked or not undocked i'm reading that this is straight out of the press release the driver
[00:55:23.040 --> 00:55:27.680]   or front passenger decides that as soon as the iphone connects to the data network of the beetle
[00:55:27.680 --> 00:55:35.680]   via the app in the docking station it all begins access to spotify oil and coolant temperature gauges
[00:55:35.680 --> 00:55:40.960]   two things that have really never been merged together before so that's exciting uh compares
[00:55:40.960 --> 00:55:44.800]   a comprehensive set of data for different routes to a particular destination they don't mention if
[00:55:44.800 --> 00:55:52.400]   it uses apple maps for that that could be a selling comprehensive so yeah and a photo function
[00:55:52.800 --> 00:55:59.280]   i don't know what that means are you taking photos with your phone or your car i think it has a
[00:55:59.280 --> 00:56:05.040]   rear mounted camera you can take a snapshot of whatever was you just backed over you take a picture
[00:56:05.040 --> 00:56:10.400]   of the guy who's tailgating you i see this is the guy that ran into me or about to run into me you
[00:56:10.400 --> 00:56:14.320]   know when they're gonna this by the way isn't available to next year and i and it will work with
[00:56:14.320 --> 00:56:19.840]   the next generation of iphone i bet you this this will be an interesting bet will it come on will
[00:56:19.840 --> 00:56:25.600]   it be will steve bomber and bill gates drive it on the stage while tim when tim cook announces it
[00:56:25.600 --> 00:56:33.040]   that would i would love to see that well you know there's there are things that mean if they really
[00:56:33.040 --> 00:56:37.200]   started going going down that path i mean so you you'd have an iphone app that would help you find
[00:56:37.200 --> 00:56:41.600]   your car in the parking lot and it would yeah you know start it up early you could be sitting in
[00:56:41.600 --> 00:56:46.080]   the theater going start my car you know and you know so it's nice and warm you know if you're
[00:56:46.080 --> 00:56:51.040]   from the northeast you understand and um you know but there's a lot of like interesting
[00:56:51.040 --> 00:56:55.600]   integration that that hasn't happened i i actually think that the Ford sync stuff is really um
[00:56:55.600 --> 00:57:00.880]   pretty awesome i rented a couple cars with it and uh but but when i think about where it does that
[00:57:00.880 --> 00:57:05.840]   with any blue tooth phone any any blue phone but i do think that there are ways i mean and and the
[00:57:05.840 --> 00:57:10.400]   geek in me that would love to see you know uh all the little things they're going on in the engine
[00:57:10.400 --> 00:57:16.320]   which would be easily um choirable i kind of like this though on the dashboard there's a dock
[00:57:16.320 --> 00:57:22.720]   yeah with the i hope a lightning connector would be funny with a 30 pin port you know we we designed
[00:57:22.720 --> 00:57:29.360]   this a while ago and uh i think i believe it looks like uh it's kind of an odd looking thing like i
[00:57:29.360 --> 00:57:37.760]   can't quite tell it's sideways so unless they redesign the iphone that that's not good product
[00:57:37.760 --> 00:57:43.760]   shot that's not gonna work yeah i always see when the when the redesigned iphone four first came out
[00:57:43.760 --> 00:57:48.560]   one of the things i really liked about it was the fact that is the first iphone where it's not like a
[00:57:48.560 --> 00:57:55.120]   bubble back it really is all flat planes and i just imagined like a car adapter for the iphone being
[00:57:55.120 --> 00:58:00.320]   kind of like a cassette like a cassette deck we just simply like you know push the iphone in like the
[00:58:00.320 --> 00:58:06.560]   first inch and then motor motorize roll is grab it then and it becomes like your cpu and your music
[00:58:06.560 --> 00:58:11.520]   library and your navigation system for a nice tidy screen in the middle there that that is that is
[00:58:11.520 --> 00:58:15.680]   a nice example of the sort of things we're talking about a little bit earlier where uh if apple keeps
[00:58:15.680 --> 00:58:20.240]   branching out of the services if they kind of make the point that we have our own system for
[00:58:20.240 --> 00:58:24.800]   connecting the cars that makes the integration into the iphone better than any other phone you can
[00:58:24.800 --> 00:58:29.760]   possibly get all the music services that we're and mapping services we're providing uh just
[00:58:29.760 --> 00:58:35.440]   absolutely intimately connected to whatever car you happen to buy um i've a friend who has a Tesla s
[00:58:35.440 --> 00:58:40.640]   and z's if he if he didn't spend enough time like screwing around on his phone before now the fact
[00:58:40.640 --> 00:58:47.520]   is yeah i'm looking outside i think i'd like this sunroof to be open four inches nope how about 30
[00:58:47.520 --> 00:58:52.800]   centimeters i think and then he can make all these adjustments and that's it's not that that's an
[00:58:52.800 --> 00:58:59.440]   incredibly useful feature but it's another example of how people are branch technologies are being
[00:58:59.440 --> 00:59:04.000]   accessible by your phone now and so if the iphone isn't the best there is at controlling your car
[00:59:04.000 --> 00:59:07.600]   and getting that sort of information while it's parked outside that hey you know there's something
[00:59:07.600 --> 00:59:11.360]   there's a light that you need really to check we really need to check right now uh before you
[00:59:11.360 --> 00:59:15.520]   before you move on uh that could be an interesting way for another company to differentiate
[00:59:15.520 --> 00:59:20.560]   the interface actually i and i do like the idea if it were really kind of integrated in and they
[00:59:20.560 --> 00:59:25.120]   this is what they're saying it's similar to just snapping in a mobile navigation system a problem
[00:59:25.120 --> 00:59:29.360]   now when you have a phone is it's hanging out of something or it's you know it's kind of glued
[00:59:29.360 --> 00:59:33.520]   onto the dashboard with a suction cup or something look this is what it says the interface located
[00:59:33.520 --> 00:59:38.080]   centrally on the dashboard of the beetle is the newly designed docking station in which the
[00:59:38.080 --> 00:59:42.320]   iphone is integrated by simply snapping it in similar to mobile navigation system you may not
[00:59:42.320 --> 00:59:46.480]   maybe you don't even need bluetooth maybe just and then the fun can begin i'm reading from the
[00:59:46.480 --> 00:59:50.960]   press release essentially all iphone functions can be used in the beetle the iphone could be used
[00:59:50.960 --> 00:59:56.080]   to navigate telephone naturally via a hands-free unit listen to music from the media library via
[00:59:56.080 --> 01:00:01.200]   the audio systems amplifiers speakers and much more the beetle app can connect the iphone of the
[01:00:01.200 --> 01:00:07.120]   beetle doctor not undocked that's what i just said i don't know what that means um doctor undocked
[01:00:07.120 --> 01:00:12.480]   oh i guess you could be in the dock or in your pocket right being that's your outside in a
[01:00:12.480 --> 01:00:16.080]   restaurant you want to know now i need to make do i need to make time to get look good go get gas
[01:00:16.080 --> 01:00:21.840]   that sort of spotify the menus are spotify expert trainer reader post-card photo post milestone
[01:00:21.840 --> 01:00:28.000]   spotify is music obviously you could switch between ightunes and spotify under the expert menu there
[01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:33.280]   are five functions which basically makes the iphone an on extended onboard instrument of the
[01:00:33.280 --> 01:00:41.280]   beetle a g meter for measuring transverse acceleration i love that this is when you're taking beat
[01:00:41.280 --> 01:00:45.680]   your beetle around the nerve ring fast and yeah for fast and furious oil and coolant temperature
[01:00:45.680 --> 01:00:50.480]   gauge is a chronometer and a compass the trainer can be used to compare driving times distances
[01:00:50.480 --> 01:00:55.920]   and fuel economy values for different routes oh so more than mapping yeah yeah that's kind of cool
[01:00:55.920 --> 01:01:00.320]   and tips can be posted via social networks like twitter and facebook such as which route leads
[01:01:00.320 --> 01:01:05.200]   to a quicker uh... death to your destination the social reader lists the latest messages
[01:01:05.200 --> 01:01:12.880]   from social networks like facebook iphone messages can be read aloud post-card in response to a
[01:01:12.880 --> 01:01:18.240]   touchscreen command the absence the current location of the beetle to friends is a digital post-card
[01:01:18.240 --> 01:01:22.000]   with a map motif saying sent with the beetle app
[01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:28.480]   photo can be taken from the interior of the beetle by the iphone camera and sent to social
[01:01:28.480 --> 01:01:30.080]   networks oh so it's taking a picture of you
[01:01:30.080 --> 01:01:38.560]   yeah i'm driving and and speaking of lawyers we just got a new dataset for lawyers to subpoena
[01:01:38.560 --> 01:01:43.680]   the next time you're in any kind of an accident right uh yes i yes i know that your car was struck
[01:01:43.680 --> 01:01:48.480]   struck by a meteor but we're going to subpoena every scrap of data from that onboard system if
[01:01:48.480 --> 01:01:52.880]   we find out that it took one picture unattended by you we're going to invalidate your insurance
[01:01:52.880 --> 01:01:56.800]   this kind of this kind of interesting would you buy a car based on
[01:01:56.800 --> 01:02:01.840]   that functionality if your big iPhone fan would be nice it could snap my iPhone in i definitely
[01:02:01.840 --> 01:02:08.000]   have to say that i i uh i am definitely whatever car i get next i'm looking to get in some kind of
[01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:13.920]   company car and and uh whatever i get next is going to have um is going to definitely have very very
[01:02:13.920 --> 01:02:16.880]   tight integration with my iPhone that's the one that's the one that's my master i have an older car
[01:02:16.880 --> 01:02:22.480]   right now it's a nice car but it's really old because i couldn't afford a nice new car and um and
[01:02:22.480 --> 01:02:28.320]   it is uh it doesn't have any integration at all and it's just very painful and and i've decided that
[01:02:28.320 --> 01:02:32.640]   is one of the most important things for me and by the way more monetized more than integration you're
[01:02:32.640 --> 01:02:38.960]   gonna have a a badge on it that says i beetle chrome badges on the front wing area of the
[01:02:38.960 --> 01:02:44.000]   eight pillars i'm not sure how excited i am about that that's where i don't it all over it says i
[01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:53.920]   beetle i beetle yeah it's the you two i've ipod only it's uh you two i beetle yeah i don't like all the
[01:02:53.920 --> 01:02:58.080]   i all the messaging but i do think that that's an important piece i mean that i agree electric
[01:02:58.080 --> 01:03:02.400]   or hybrid or something like that or two presumably vox wag and leverage is this by saying okay you
[01:03:02.400 --> 01:03:05.680]   may not buy an i beetle but you're gonna be able to have some of this functionality and all of our
[01:03:05.680 --> 01:03:11.040]   beetles right yeah i i do think it's something that people are gonna start expecting as they start
[01:03:11.040 --> 01:03:14.560]   to buy new cars that their that their phone is gonna work really really great with it we're seeing
[01:03:14.560 --> 01:03:18.800]   a lot of different car commercials that uh in that just part of the commercial is hey we're landing
[01:03:18.800 --> 01:03:22.560]   we're landing in the middle in the middle middle of a blizzard the car then a parking lot is covered
[01:03:22.560 --> 01:03:26.000]   with snow but don't worry we've already turned off turned on the heater we've already turned on the
[01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:31.200]   engine uh just because as soon as we got a 4g connection so um
[01:03:31.200 --> 01:03:40.880]   afghanistan's unofficial apple store from cultus from cultive mac wham i mean that won't load though
[01:03:40.880 --> 01:03:46.480]   come on come on internet i know you can do it it's a long way to afghanistan come on
[01:03:46.480 --> 01:03:52.720]   this page won't load do you have it i don't know what's yeah what's something's wrong with my computer
[01:03:55.200 --> 01:04:00.400]   not never heard that before there's a lot of unofficial apple stores though around the around
[01:04:00.400 --> 01:04:06.000]   the world you cannot get there at any of them apple store afghanistan they even have a a lit
[01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:13.760]   up apple logo they couldn't afford a light the stem just the apple the metal detector is a nice touch
[01:04:13.760 --> 01:04:17.680]   is that a metal detector i don't think it's a metal detector it's just the door it's
[01:04:17.680 --> 01:04:25.520]   shaping the bezel of the uh yeah of the iphone yeah um the genius bar is a little sparse according to
[01:04:25.520 --> 01:04:29.680]   the cult of mac and the flooring never look at the flooring never would have been approved by steve
[01:04:29.680 --> 01:04:34.000]   jobs but if you find yourself in cobble with a deep thirst for the latest apple gadgetry
[01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:39.280]   the unofficial apple store of afghanistan and there's the one there's the guy there's the genius
[01:04:39.280 --> 01:04:44.480]   well so they they gotta feel pretty safe because all they have to do is like if they get a letter
[01:04:44.480 --> 01:04:48.080]   from apple saying that's fine why don't you come over here and we'll discuss it
[01:04:48.080 --> 01:04:53.600]   according to according to the store they sell about five or six iphones a day to well off afghans
[01:04:53.600 --> 01:04:58.080]   most of the products are purchased through distributors in Dubai the demand has been so great the owners
[01:04:58.080 --> 01:05:04.160]   are even thinking about expanding to a second location businesses booming but still apple
[01:05:04.160 --> 01:05:15.120]   refuses to open an official apple store in cobble uh did it do china launched a pirate ios store
[01:05:15.120 --> 01:05:18.400]   and you don't even need a jailbreak to use it i don't know how they're doing this
[01:05:18.400 --> 01:05:25.120]   um it looks you know fairly serious
[01:05:25.120 --> 01:05:32.800]   no jailbreak alternative to items that only not only pirates ios apps but helps sync them to your
[01:05:32.800 --> 01:05:39.120]   iphone or ipad and they have it on the web i guess we could go there you want to go there i don't know
[01:05:39.120 --> 01:05:43.200]   makes me kind of nervous have you ever used a credit card on that phone which
[01:05:43.200 --> 01:05:47.360]   maybe you shouldn't use it look at it look at it look at it we are committed to provide you with
[01:05:47.360 --> 01:05:52.960]   unique convenient and pleasant ios device management experiences with completely free of charge
[01:05:52.960 --> 01:06:02.560]   english version coming so okay um simple to use without apple id easy to manage device with
[01:06:02.560 --> 01:06:08.160]   windows explorer plenty of free apps if you want to pay please go to the app store
[01:06:08.160 --> 01:06:12.080]   it says paid please go to the app store
[01:06:12.080 --> 01:06:22.320]   wow wow and so you download this i'm not i don't think i'll put this on my computer probably not
[01:06:22.320 --> 01:06:30.240]   not only not a good idea you get what you pay for right yes even it's it's bad enough when i'm
[01:06:30.240 --> 01:06:36.240]   on an actual like the android's place the google play store or the ios store and i see an app
[01:06:36.240 --> 01:06:40.720]   that's very very useful and very very polished so it's very very well funded but it's free
[01:06:40.720 --> 01:06:45.440]   and i don't even see like here's where the here's where the paid add-ons are it's like i don't
[01:06:45.440 --> 01:06:50.400]   care if it's like it's gotten a thousand like five star recommendations this is the best sms app ever
[01:06:50.400 --> 01:06:56.240]   made unless there's a way that i can actually give you money and prove you need to prove to me that
[01:06:56.240 --> 01:07:01.760]   you're making money off of this that doesn't involve stealing my data or like you know that's
[01:07:01.760 --> 01:07:07.360]   no good but yeah even even there but that's even there is at least it's not pirated software so
[01:07:07.360 --> 01:07:12.800]   it's you got to remember that every time that's almost every time that someone gets a virus on a
[01:07:12.800 --> 01:07:16.800]   mac or an ios device or really almost any other kind of device it's because they were trying to get
[01:07:16.800 --> 01:07:20.480]   pirated software i agree or even pirated video files something to do
[01:07:22.160 --> 01:07:25.520]   uh itc is tossing out motor rollers complaint against apple
[01:07:25.520 --> 01:07:33.200]   the german court on friday and i go google's motor roller and injunction against microsoft over
[01:07:33.200 --> 01:07:39.680]   a push notification patent that's invalid uh then the u_s_i_t_c_ on monday yesterday
[01:07:39.680 --> 01:07:44.880]   throughout the last patent suit remaining in the investigation of motor rollers complaint
[01:07:44.880 --> 01:07:50.000]   against apple the sensor controlled user interface for portable communication device that patent
[01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:55.280]   was found invalid so google can appeal federal appeals court
[01:07:55.280 --> 01:08:01.520]   um no indication of whether they're going to or not but it looks like apple's pretty much
[01:08:01.520 --> 01:08:04.640]   won everywhere hands down in the patent battles
[01:08:04.640 --> 01:08:13.360]   i think that's i i don't think there's anything i've missed here there's a new mac pro coming out
[01:08:13.360 --> 01:08:21.760]   no although i will i will i will say that i've gotten i've talked to two different people who've
[01:08:21.760 --> 01:08:24.880]   given me information that make me think that we're gonna see something really cool this year
[01:08:24.880 --> 01:08:30.800]   nothing nothing more specific than that unfortunately but now i've sort of like raised that from
[01:08:30.800 --> 01:08:34.720]   okay it makes sense and i suppose there's some rumblings to that too okay there are a couple
[01:08:34.720 --> 01:08:39.200]   people whose word that i tend to have a lot of faith in who have said okay that's interesting
[01:08:39.200 --> 01:08:42.800]   rich rich seagulls near you know you're a developer you're your pro user
[01:08:42.800 --> 01:08:51.920]   um do you use mac pros i do um are you anxious to see a new one i have i have three within 15 feet
[01:08:51.920 --> 01:08:57.360]   of me one down here which is my daily use workstation and an old one which is out of service and one
[01:08:57.360 --> 01:09:02.480]   across the room which is a file server would you consider buying an iMac instead well
[01:09:04.480 --> 01:09:12.560]   i could certainly i you know the the iMacs um are great machines they're very fast
[01:09:12.560 --> 01:09:18.640]   and i'm sure that i could spend enough money and plug enough storage into them to uh to do the job
[01:09:18.640 --> 01:09:24.880]   but one thing i have that i just cannot give up is my 30 inch cinema display oh i know
[01:09:24.880 --> 01:09:31.760]   um who i know and and i like the notion of having my central
[01:09:33.360 --> 01:09:36.480]   processing the machine itself separated from the display
[01:09:36.480 --> 01:09:41.280]   it makes it easy to upgrade one of the other or makes it easy to replace one of the other
[01:09:41.280 --> 01:09:46.800]   have you have you done any upgrades to the i up i put a new video card in i put uh ssd in
[01:09:46.800 --> 01:09:53.040]   have you done anything like that to your old in the macro yes i've upgraded drives i have
[01:09:53.040 --> 01:10:00.240]   an interesting little device which is a pci card that accepts an ssd and
[01:10:01.520 --> 01:10:09.200]   gives you pretty much best possible throughput yeah i've i bought a pci express card ssd from
[01:10:09.200 --> 01:10:14.640]   other world computing it was amazing yeah sorry i bought a pci express ssd from other world computing
[01:10:14.640 --> 01:10:21.520]   same idea yeah i have unbelievable unbelievable the speed uh have one of those and actually that's
[01:10:21.520 --> 01:10:26.720]   my boot drive yeah i've added internal storage which you can't do to an iMac right i've had
[01:10:26.720 --> 01:10:34.640]   drives fail and replace them which is hard to do on an iMac hard to do it in iMac yeah uh so i
[01:10:34.640 --> 01:10:41.920]   you know i i look forward to seeing the next generation of high-end hardware from apple
[01:10:41.920 --> 01:10:49.440]   they have always had a performance leader they they've always had sort of a statement machine
[01:10:49.440 --> 01:10:55.600]   which demonstrates what's possible with today's tech uh the great thing about it is that it's got
[01:10:55.600 --> 01:11:02.160]   a really long service life too i have a 2006 machine and i have a a 2008 that i got used and i have a
[01:11:02.160 --> 01:11:09.680]   2010 machine and they're they're great so what could an uh let's assume Andy's uh sources are
[01:11:09.680 --> 01:11:14.320]   accurate i'm sure they are something really exciting doesn't sound like an actual cheese
[01:11:14.320 --> 01:11:19.440]   greater mac pro though it sounds like something what in your wildest dreams what would it be a
[01:11:19.440 --> 01:11:30.480]   modular mac pro i don't know she's greater machine or a modular machine i i apple has clearly gotten
[01:11:30.480 --> 01:11:38.240]   out of the modular hardware business they want consumers customers yeah to uh to buy the machine
[01:11:38.240 --> 01:11:45.040]   and put it into service right and i think that anything that introduces friction into that process
[01:11:45.600 --> 01:11:54.080]   is something they want to avoid but i can see the uh i can see a hypothetical pro machine
[01:11:54.080 --> 01:12:00.240]   being state-of-the-art in terms of the connection uh the internal connections that it supports
[01:12:00.240 --> 01:12:07.200]   20 gigabit thunderbolt out the back um that's something we definitely need um you know lots of
[01:12:07.200 --> 01:12:12.880]   memory slots hard to tell with PCI what they're going to do with that but there's there's a new
[01:12:12.880 --> 01:12:19.200]   PCI express there's new status standards uh and and much has been made of just how far behind
[01:12:19.200 --> 01:12:24.800]   uh the mac pros have fallen in terms of their internal uh connectivity so
[01:12:24.800 --> 01:12:32.320]   you know i i think stuff like that the the latest generation of intel server processors clearly
[01:12:32.320 --> 01:12:37.600]   i wonder uh if the maid remember they were talking about uh in fact Tim Cook said we're
[01:12:37.600 --> 01:12:43.920]   gonna make max in the u.s. this year is that the mac pro or is that just an i-mac or something else
[01:12:43.920 --> 01:12:49.120]   mac mini i don't know it almost it would almost manufacturer i-max in the u.s
[01:12:49.120 --> 01:13:00.640]   that was my recollection was it was it i-max oh okay i just i don't i just uh i just i don't think
[01:13:00.640 --> 01:13:04.240]   they're gonna do a cheese grater i just don't see that no they're they're they're they'll go back
[01:13:04.240 --> 01:13:08.720]   the old design no i like what you said though rich apple needs one product this state of
[01:13:08.720 --> 01:13:15.040]   that says this is the this is the top of the line state of the art i mean i could definitely see a
[01:13:15.040 --> 01:13:19.920]   to you something that would fit basically in a to you that doesn't isn't set up for rack mounting
[01:13:19.920 --> 01:13:24.160]   but you could put rack mounts on it like you could put a piece of lines on it slide them on
[01:13:24.160 --> 01:13:28.240]   and stick them in so it was really built for that rather than what we do now which is cut off the
[01:13:28.240 --> 01:13:33.440]   parts of the cheese grater and put stuff on to rack it in and and so something that was but it was
[01:13:33.440 --> 01:13:37.440]   if it looked really cool and then you could you could set it up if you wanted to and maybe set it
[01:13:37.440 --> 01:13:44.320]   upward or sideways and then and possibly put some put some ears on it and shove it into a rack
[01:13:44.320 --> 01:13:51.200]   two you know two slots and i think that and then a bunch of uh you know thunderbolt connect
[01:13:51.200 --> 01:13:54.720]   you know five thunderbolt connections or four thunderbolt connections that's pretty much it
[01:13:54.720 --> 01:13:58.240]   like i mean i think that's what you know that's what it would be something that would be i think
[01:13:58.240 --> 01:14:01.520]   compelling outside of that i think they just keep on making i-max
[01:14:01.600 --> 01:14:09.600]   yeah thunderbolt connections are expensive and there's a technical there's a technical issue
[01:14:09.600 --> 01:14:14.400]   there with thunderbolt which i think might have created some headaches and that is thunderbolt
[01:14:14.400 --> 01:14:23.360]   carries video from the video card right and so you even though it is PCI on a wire it is also
[01:14:23.360 --> 01:14:30.000]   video from a video card on the wire and you cannot just put a PCI card into a Mac Pro and
[01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:34.000]   yay you've got thunderbolt it doesn't work oh no no i think i think that the PCI cards are separate
[01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:37.120]   from thunder i think the thunderbolt i know i i thunderbolt hangs built into the
[01:14:37.120 --> 01:14:42.960]   main the motherboard okay go there and and so i think that creates a little bit of an issue because
[01:14:42.960 --> 01:14:50.240]   right now um the computers we've seen that do thunderbolt have it on the motherboard bringing
[01:14:50.240 --> 01:14:58.240]   video out of either integrated or discrete video video which is on the motherboard i think asis
[01:14:58.240 --> 01:15:03.680]   or somebody has done sort of a little back channel which lets you connect a video card
[01:15:03.680 --> 01:15:09.200]   back to the motherboard and it pipes video out thunderbolt for it well and and for me the the
[01:15:09.200 --> 01:15:12.960]   need for the PCI slots are not necessarily graphics cards or anything else it's ingest cards you know
[01:15:12.960 --> 01:15:16.960]   control cards that we that we need you know like right now i have this box that sits outside of my
[01:15:16.960 --> 01:15:22.160]   laptop and uh to get you know high-end video in and so that's the kind of stuff that that we would be
[01:15:22.160 --> 01:15:26.160]   interested in is being able to you know connect those and have them all inside the box rather than
[01:15:26.160 --> 01:15:29.840]   living outside the box which is what they're doing now i'm gonna get cards now for them but that's the
[01:15:29.840 --> 01:15:35.760]   issue with like mac i'm ax and so on so forth right and if you're a gamer you're gonna want to add
[01:15:35.760 --> 01:15:40.320]   high-end video to this thing eventually well the question though so we want to add high-end video
[01:15:40.320 --> 01:15:44.400]   but the question with a gamer is do you need the actual video out from the card or you just need
[01:15:44.400 --> 01:15:48.320]   to accelerate so does that you know it does you know it can theoretically you know you could have
[01:15:48.320 --> 01:15:54.400]   it so that it's going out there but it's processing those those uh the triangles um specifically uh
[01:15:54.400 --> 01:15:59.120]   you know faster you know you can add that that that ability but still have it coming out of the
[01:15:59.120 --> 01:16:05.440]   thunderbolt also what what's it's currently done but it certainly could be done yeah yeah
[01:16:05.440 --> 01:16:10.560]   also what's a gamer doing buying a mac hey you know when you boot windows on it it's great
[01:16:10.560 --> 01:16:17.440]   uh all right just thought i'd try to get some mac news in there i've done my job now
[01:16:17.440 --> 01:16:22.400]   we're gonna take a break come back with our picks of the week rich you got something something
[01:16:22.400 --> 01:16:27.520]   you want to talk about i'm sure you do will rich seagull from bare bones software oh yeah i see
[01:16:27.520 --> 01:16:34.800]   you do i like it oh dear you're gonna make me fat rich you already have actually it's too late
[01:16:34.800 --> 01:16:42.080]   more good just claim all responsible more good food stuffs from rich seagull but uh and of course
[01:16:42.080 --> 01:16:47.440]   Alex Lindsey and uh Andy and Akko with their picks before we do that let's talk about shutters stock
[01:16:48.320 --> 01:16:53.920]   more and more i'm seeing if i'm on a blog that has great images or a website uh i'm seeing at the
[01:16:53.920 --> 01:16:58.560]   bottom images from shutters stock they don't have to do that but i think shutters stock is such a
[01:16:58.560 --> 01:17:04.320]   great service a lot of people want to tell the world about it they have literally millions of images
[01:17:04.320 --> 01:17:12.720]   uh 20 million high quality stock photos illustrations vectors video clips for you for your publications
[01:17:12.720 --> 01:17:20.000]   for your menus for your website whatever it is you need it royalty-free images for or video for
[01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:23.120]   this is the place to get it they do two things which i really like they have a
[01:17:23.120 --> 01:17:27.760]   subscription pack that's what i have 25 images a day that's great for somebody who's publishing
[01:17:27.760 --> 01:17:32.560]   content all the time uh you could download any image in any size pay one price it's yours to use
[01:17:32.560 --> 01:17:38.480]   in whatever you need and the search tools on here are fantastic you can go to shutters stock right
[01:17:38.480 --> 01:17:43.040]   now you don't even need to make an account to play with their sophisticated search tools although if
[01:17:43.040 --> 01:17:52.560]   you make a free account you get even more capabilities um okay pick an emotion sad pick a uh an animal
[01:17:52.560 --> 01:17:59.520]   uh monkey panda okay too late already said sad monkey do you think there's possibly in
[01:17:59.520 --> 01:18:05.200]   their 20 million images any images of sad monkeys anywhere buried within there i don't know let's
[01:18:05.200 --> 01:18:09.840]   do a search my computer this is not shutters stock my computer is just there's something real
[01:18:09.840 --> 01:18:19.920]   wait a minute 1,407 sad monkeys apparently there are a lot of sad monkeys in the world so as
[01:18:19.920 --> 01:18:29.200]   sad that's a sad oh now i'm sad i did that let's do happy monkey that was i feel bad these poor
[01:18:29.200 --> 01:18:33.440]   sad monkeys so you get the idea you can even go further here you see on the left you could
[01:18:33.440 --> 01:18:37.040]   choose image type photo illustration vector you could choose the orientation orientation
[01:18:37.040 --> 01:18:42.000]   portrait or landscape mood you can mode you can choose a category you can exclude keywords you
[01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:48.720]   could choose by contributor name here's some happy monkeys lots of happy monkeys aww is a happy
[01:18:48.720 --> 01:18:58.240]   chimpanzee you can i think every blog post should have a happy chimpanzee in it uh you can do it by
[01:18:58.240 --> 01:19:03.520]   category and i love this they've got a color wheel so you can now see you have to be uh i guess you
[01:19:03.520 --> 01:19:08.400]   have to log in to get the color wheel but you could choose by by color they also have a great
[01:19:08.400 --> 01:19:14.320]   light box tool which lets you save images let me log into my account let you save images uh to a
[01:19:14.320 --> 01:19:19.360]   light box and then share them anytime with other team members you say here's what we're thinking
[01:19:19.360 --> 01:19:26.080]   can you uh take it off my screen minutes for a moment just while i log in and uh are you doing
[01:19:26.080 --> 01:19:30.640]   a search for something besides sad monkeys yeah i'm searching for pandas but with a specific blue
[01:19:30.640 --> 01:19:36.640]   color it looks blue pandas there are none yeah don't you know that sorry didn't you study pandas
[01:19:36.640 --> 01:19:43.040]   in school that's the color there's a color wheel oh see there's something there's all the blue images
[01:19:43.040 --> 01:19:49.440]   all of blue ladies said my perfect blue blue city blue sky blue sky shabov me

[01:20:37.600 --> 01:20:42.320]   we thank them so much for their support of all of our twitch shows now let's get some picks
[01:20:42.320 --> 01:20:48.080]   of the weeks as we talked food and it's lunch time let me let let rich seagull go first rich
[01:20:49.200 --> 01:20:53.520]   well first let me let me get this out of the way and it was the name that sold it this is the
[01:20:53.520 --> 01:20:59.920]   eichmutz it's an air filter for your mac pro it is an air filter for the mac pro by the fine
[01:20:59.920 --> 01:21:05.040]   folks at trans international oh i love them i used to buy my memory from them exclusively and i i
[01:21:05.040 --> 01:21:09.920]   haven't installed this one yet it's it's got a little adhesive backing and the picture on the
[01:21:09.920 --> 01:21:16.720]   front sort of tells the story it it sticks to the front of the machine and it's a foam filter which
[01:21:16.720 --> 01:21:23.440]   catches all the stuff that would normally get sucked into the machine i could tell you when i
[01:21:23.440 --> 01:21:29.360]   opened my mac pro two and a half year old mac pro to put in the the drive and the uh in the video
[01:21:29.360 --> 01:21:35.520]   card it was disgusting so much dust in there it gets sucked right in you have pets at home you
[01:21:35.520 --> 01:21:40.480]   have cats are gone no and that's the well i have a dog but it but it's mostly just dust that was
[01:21:40.480 --> 01:21:44.160]   the funny thing i mean just that's what happens over time because air is being drawn through the
[01:21:44.160 --> 01:21:49.200]   case i think this is a very good idea uh so i'm i'm looking forward to trying it out it's
[01:21:49.200 --> 01:21:54.880]   it's uh open cell so it doesn't really impede the airflow and when it fills up
[01:21:54.880 --> 01:22:00.960]   theoretically you just vacuum it out and uh we'll see how good my i did this is very dusty so i'm
[01:22:00.960 --> 01:22:06.480]   real interested i did break out the uh the dyson uh suck stick what do they call it
[01:22:07.760 --> 01:22:14.720]   the vacuum that's not the name it's a little it's a little a battery portable and i put on the
[01:22:14.720 --> 01:22:19.760]   a little um the little nozzle and i got all that stuff out it's probably good idea to do that on
[01:22:19.760 --> 01:22:25.360]   regular basis the dyson there it is there's the schmutz what is the schmutz master if it's all
[01:22:25.360 --> 01:22:33.680]   mac pros because really it's just a piece of foam the ishmutz air filter uh and my other pick
[01:22:33.680 --> 01:22:39.120]   because yeah there has to be something food related for frilio is uh these cookies i hate you
[01:22:39.120 --> 01:22:47.360]   neck-ot any kot in the south you you might know this name um but i learned recently that they they
[01:22:47.360 --> 01:22:53.440]   are uh the brand is now owned by sniders of hand over the pretzel people oh yeah i like them and i
[01:22:53.440 --> 01:22:58.160]   like their products as well and it's great because this stuff is going nationwide these cookies are
[01:22:58.160 --> 01:23:05.120]   really nice because um they're not very sweet they're not over sweetened there's just a little
[01:23:05.120 --> 01:23:09.920]   there's enough to remind you that you're not eating a cracker and and the peanut butter really just
[01:23:09.920 --> 01:23:17.120]   works with it the neck-ot with real peanut butter we're not talking fake peanut butter in here
[01:23:17.120 --> 01:23:22.960]   not the other thing that i uh that i like about these folks is you know i i try to read the ingredients
[01:23:22.960 --> 01:23:28.400]   and i look at what they're using and and it's pretty simple it's making something about how
[01:23:28.400 --> 01:23:34.160]   they're avoiding high fructose corn syrup and and artificial ingredients and all sorts of other
[01:23:34.160 --> 01:23:39.040]   strangeness well there is corn syrup in it but maybe it's low fructose corn syrup yeah maybe normal
[01:23:39.040 --> 01:23:44.800]   syrup like k-ro is there a difference in k-ro syrup and high fructose corn syrup or are there are
[01:23:44.800 --> 01:23:51.200]   other two different things i'm divided attention at the moment so rich seagull thank you so much for
[01:23:51.200 --> 01:23:56.640]   being here uh Alex Lindsey your pick of the week from beautiful cancun and if it has something to do
[01:23:56.640 --> 01:24:03.840]   with white sand beaches and tropical temperatures i'm there it does it does oh man oh kind of
[01:24:03.840 --> 01:24:08.880]   oh it's the technology so it's one of the things i plan to be using right after the show in the
[01:24:08.880 --> 01:24:17.120]   water i um i hate you is this so this is the gopro hero yeah and um with the waterproof case i love
[01:24:17.120 --> 01:24:23.680]   this camera now you have the hero three yet yeah this is the hero three the hero three black top of
[01:24:23.680 --> 01:24:29.120]   the line yeah you know so i have one so tell me what can i do with it because i have not used it
[01:24:29.120 --> 01:24:34.560]   okay i know i bought it and then i have to admit i shouldn't say this but i have a hero too that i
[01:24:34.560 --> 01:24:39.920]   actually still like it's i know me too around my house i think this is a great idea worse than that
[01:24:39.920 --> 01:24:46.240]   i have a hero three silver yes that's our that's our camera that we use for the thrill cam
[01:24:46.800 --> 01:24:52.080]   right all it's being used for is zip lining across the studio so the there it is so what there
[01:24:52.080 --> 01:25:04.560]   so the uh um the black is the back is 4k right yes so this is 4k and uh so one of the things that i
[01:25:04.560 --> 01:25:10.800]   that i'll post soon but i don't want to anyway i'm still learning how to do it but i actually built
[01:25:10.800 --> 01:25:14.640]   an attachment or i took one of the sticker attachments i put it on the windshield of my car
[01:25:14.640 --> 01:25:21.040]   and i've become kind of obsessed with taking uh you know little car uh time lapses so you drive around
[01:25:21.040 --> 01:25:24.800]   that's fun you get all of that stuff and um i'm gonna take it into the water today and
[01:25:24.800 --> 01:25:28.960]   let's see how it works that's what i that's what i got it for i really want to dive with it yeah yeah
[01:25:28.960 --> 01:25:33.440]   yeah so i'm gonna i'm gonna have some fun with it and uh but the idea and then i've got one of
[01:25:33.440 --> 01:25:38.080]   things i'm gonna be playing with soon is they have like a little um head strap that you can put on it
[01:25:38.080 --> 01:25:42.000]   and it tilts down and i think i can do really good training with it so i can kind of grab on and
[01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:46.000]   talk about things um so it's just kind of like i can see how wide angle it's very wide angle now
[01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:51.440]   you can set it for different uh crop you can set it for a medium as well which um so but the uh so
[01:25:51.440 --> 01:25:55.600]   the idea is that i can do training or talk about products with it kind of sitting kind of leaning
[01:25:55.600 --> 01:25:59.600]   over like this where i can talk and have it there uh and because it's a wide angle you don't really
[01:25:59.600 --> 01:26:04.080]   notice all the camera moving around as long as you don't you know you don't go crazy with it oh that's
[01:26:04.080 --> 01:26:09.840]   why of course that makes sense right yeah because yeah so much there so that's why it feels so so
[01:26:09.840 --> 01:26:15.280]   so uh interestingly uh stable so anyway the um but the cool thing of course is to bring it back to
[01:26:15.280 --> 01:26:19.760]   Macbreak is that it it integrates incredibly well with your iPhone that's what you're seeing by the
[01:26:19.760 --> 01:26:23.600]   way here when you when we show it with it's on an iPad that's now there you see there's a little
[01:26:23.600 --> 01:26:28.160]   latency a little lag maybe a few seconds yeah there's a couple seconds but the cool thing is is that
[01:26:28.160 --> 01:26:31.600]   when you're putting this in in odd places and trying to figure out whether it's working when
[01:26:31.600 --> 01:26:35.040]   it's up here like this and everything else well it's kind of hard because it's up here and then
[01:26:35.040 --> 01:26:38.960]   what how are you gonna know whether it's pointing the right way and the iPhone you know the iPhone
[01:26:38.960 --> 01:26:44.480]   to let you change the settings it lets you see what's going on it it's just a really really great
[01:26:44.480 --> 01:26:48.320]   solution and the hero three has it all built in with the hero two or hero one hero two you needed
[01:26:48.320 --> 01:26:54.800]   a back to do the Wi-Fi control it's built into the hero three and it shoots 4k and it's it's just
[01:26:54.800 --> 01:27:00.000]   it's really cool so anyway um it took me a long time the only reason i bring it up it took me a
[01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:03.760]   long time to i was excited about GoPros it took me a long time to figure out what i was going to
[01:27:03.760 --> 01:27:08.480]   do with them and now that i'm starting to do stuff with them i can't can't stop so anyway cool
[01:27:08.480 --> 01:27:15.360]   anyway i actually have a bumper mount for mine my first gen himself which screws into the
[01:27:15.360 --> 01:27:21.120]   tow hook fitting on my car and it's great because it's rigid it won't fall off and you get some
[01:27:21.120 --> 01:27:27.840]   awesome video how much is that how much is that top of the line hero three black three ninety nine
[01:27:27.840 --> 01:27:32.240]   and that includes by the way the mount yes yes it comes with one of the mounts but then of course
[01:27:32.240 --> 01:27:36.400]   what happens is you start you know buying a five more ounce and yeah and one of the things i the
[01:27:36.400 --> 01:27:39.920]   suction cup you you can get one that just as a quarter or twenty you know like like you would
[01:27:39.920 --> 01:27:44.560]   have for a tripod and um and then at that point you're able to just kind of attach it to all kinds
[01:27:44.560 --> 01:27:47.360]   of things and one of the things i'm going to be doing when i go back to africa and then in the
[01:27:47.360 --> 01:27:51.840]   near uh in the next couple months is shoot so i get some forward cams going through towns but
[01:27:51.840 --> 01:27:55.600]   i'm also going to stick them stick one to the to the side so you can get people going by and
[01:27:55.600 --> 01:28:00.800]   you know all kinds of other fun stuff so um anyway it's nifty yeah and this this one has Wi-Fi
[01:28:00.800 --> 01:28:05.520]   built in which is really nice so you don't need to add the Wi-Fi uh on the back there's another
[01:28:05.520 --> 01:28:10.640]   thing you have to deal with 15 frame per second uh 4k i don't i've not tried that i can't imagine
[01:28:10.640 --> 01:28:16.640]   it's very good quality but it is it's pretty it's remarkably good quality really so wow yeah so um
[01:28:16.640 --> 01:28:21.920]   uh it's not i mean it's not the same as an SLR but it's still i was i was actually pretty surprised at
[01:28:21.920 --> 01:28:27.440]   the quality that i was looking at go pro they've got a silver they've got white for two hundred
[01:28:27.440 --> 01:28:32.160]   dollars the white edition on the hero three um and that would be a good choice by the way it's
[01:28:32.160 --> 01:28:37.840]   12 megapixels uh and you could do super slow mo too which is kind of fun which i haven't tried yet
[01:28:37.840 --> 01:28:42.160]   yeah that's kind of fun not super slow mo regular slow mo it's like 60 frames a second time it's
[01:28:42.160 --> 01:28:46.560]   it's it's cool yeah at time lapse is cool too i've done i've used the time lapse that's fun
[01:28:46.560 --> 01:28:49.440]   i'm telling you attach it to your car and drive around then you get obsessed with it because you're
[01:28:49.440 --> 01:28:54.560]   like driving through petaluma with with time lapse is um it's cool all the far go
[01:28:57.760 --> 01:29:03.440]   all right and now ladies and gentlemen we had cookies it's time for scrapple who's Andy
[01:29:03.440 --> 01:29:10.640]   Naka I'm not scrapple but scapble oh uh i've been making that mistake all morning too uh this is a
[01:29:10.640 --> 01:29:15.440]   really nice like sort of like mind map app uh that just got released this morning by literature
[01:29:15.440 --> 01:29:21.680]   and latte of the folks that also make uh uh scrivener uh and uh it's very it's as a very very
[01:29:21.680 --> 01:29:27.520]   simple app it's for i've got a doc can open here it's for doing like diagrams like this it's not for
[01:29:27.520 --> 01:29:32.800]   like outlines where you are you have a rigid sense of control and hierarchy it's where
[01:29:32.800 --> 01:29:38.640]   you are slapping down ideas and then forming connections between those ideas either to create a
[01:29:38.640 --> 01:29:43.360]   diagram you're going to show to other people or just to organize a really sprawling concept or
[01:29:43.360 --> 01:29:50.240]   a sprawling project uh inside your head uh it's very very simple uh i mean it's really there's
[01:29:50.240 --> 01:29:56.320]   you can put any kind of uh any kind of data on there you want pictures uh text uh adding something new
[01:29:56.320 --> 01:30:03.600]   is just as simple as just click where you want to go hit enter uh there you go and just type here's
[01:30:03.600 --> 01:30:09.120]   since we're talking about big uh the big bang we will talk about uh go ahead miller
[01:30:09.120 --> 01:30:16.400]   there you go and we want to connect and he was part of niell's bores band i think so we destroyed
[01:30:16.400 --> 01:30:23.040]   there there and now we've got a line connecting uh clex neil was on the drums he really amazing
[01:30:23.040 --> 01:30:27.920]   fella but he the problem was he thought drumming was kind of relative you see you see him like
[01:30:27.920 --> 01:30:34.160]   sweating through an undershirt a tuxedo shirt and a tuxedo jacket yeah that's why he was the mad
[01:30:34.160 --> 01:30:40.800]   man of madison was constantly called him um and so it's so really the the the purpose of this app
[01:30:40.800 --> 01:30:46.560]   really is again so the times where you just have ideas and and things you just need to get them down
[01:30:46.560 --> 01:30:49.840]   and then find the organizations or the connections later this is a great thing for when having like
[01:30:49.840 --> 01:30:53.840]   sort of an open meeting when treatment just kicking out ideas and you need to
[01:30:53.840 --> 01:31:01.280]   sort of have a very very fluid idea of uh what all this data is like uh and uh and uh you and uh
[01:31:01.280 --> 01:31:07.440]   you it doesn't integrate into uh into uh scrivener uh so that you can drag things into and out of a
[01:31:07.440 --> 01:31:12.240]   scrivener project it's not as tightly integrated as i would like it to be uh but you can but it does
[01:31:12.240 --> 01:31:17.360]   it is a nice you can see that it was uh a tool created by the same sort of people who thought
[01:31:17.360 --> 01:31:22.000]   that scrivener would be a really good tool um the only the and the one one other thing that
[01:31:22.000 --> 01:31:27.600]   bears mentioning uh the famous app for mac that uh that does the sort of thing is of course omnigraffle
[01:31:27.600 --> 01:31:33.280]   from omnigroup uh and that is like the killer app for uh if you're if you're trying to figure out
[01:31:33.280 --> 01:31:39.120]   okay so um today we're gonna figure out how we're gonna replace the space shuttle uh all we know
[01:31:39.120 --> 01:31:44.640]   going into this conference room is that it should start on the ground and go up generally uh and
[01:31:44.640 --> 01:31:48.720]   it's gonna cost a lot of money let's start spitballing idea that that the omnigraffle is the sort
[01:31:48.720 --> 01:31:54.400]   of thing for for that kind of really major major project or for creating really beautiful polished
[01:31:54.400 --> 01:31:59.440]   of charts and graphics uh they're gonna be using someplace else this isn't this sort of an app
[01:31:59.440 --> 01:32:05.440]   but the difference is that the cheap version of omnigraffle goes for $99 uh and scapple goes for
[01:32:05.440 --> 01:32:10.800]   15 bucks so it's not mind mapping it's just drawing lines but for a lot of people that's all you need
[01:32:10.800 --> 01:32:14.880]   well i mean my mind mapping for whoever you know this is this is i'm sure the people who
[01:32:14.880 --> 01:32:19.280]   will sell you like a hundred dollar course for three hours on mind mapping so oh yeah this is
[01:32:19.280 --> 01:32:24.080]   this is really all about i know i've got this project whether it's i need i want to add a deck
[01:32:24.080 --> 01:32:28.160]   to it and add a deck to the house you're all the elements i'm gonna have to coordinate to get this
[01:32:28.160 --> 01:32:33.040]   going to i'm gonna be writing a story soon uh and i want to make sure that there's a structure to
[01:32:33.040 --> 01:32:36.640]   the outline before even really figure out what these care who these characters are what they're
[01:32:36.640 --> 01:32:41.520]   doing uh this is not the sort of that's not the sort of thing for which you would gamble a hundred
[01:32:41.520 --> 01:32:47.440]   bucks uh to hope the hope that this will help you organize things gamble 15 bucks sure and on top
[01:32:47.440 --> 01:32:51.840]   everything else you get a 30 day free trial uh just as you do with uh with scrivener so you get
[01:32:51.840 --> 01:32:55.280]   the full version of the app for 30 days you can save you can open you can print you can export to
[01:32:55.280 --> 01:32:59.680]   all that kind of cool stuff uh and really it's that's almost enough time to figure out uh add a deck
[01:32:59.680 --> 01:33:04.000]   to your porch add a deck to your house and uh you know but but still some of the 15 bucks they're
[01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:08.480]   good people and that's 15 dollars is going to go towards creating the ipad version of scrivener
[01:33:08.480 --> 01:33:13.840]   and every dollar we can give them towards finishing that ipad app is another date towards towards
[01:33:13.840 --> 01:33:20.160]   towards nirvana for people like me yes in dd hey i don't have a product uh that's out yet but they
[01:33:20.160 --> 01:33:25.600]   announced it today and i'm very intrigued if you've ever seen the microsoft surface uh tablets where
[01:33:25.600 --> 01:33:31.520]   they have a magnetic you know like the apple smart cover uh cover but it has a keyboard built
[01:33:31.520 --> 01:33:36.400]   into it a flat keyboard logitech has just announced the same technology for the ipad they call it the
[01:33:36.400 --> 01:33:42.720]   fabric skin keyboard folio uh i uh i will pre i pre-ordered it i won't have it for a while just
[01:33:42.720 --> 01:33:48.160]   just announced 150 bucks a little pricey but i i i like the idea of a of a cover
[01:33:48.160 --> 01:33:52.400]   keyboard cover that doesn't take up a lot of space like the you know the keyboard that i like
[01:33:52.400 --> 01:33:56.480]   which is the logitech and we've talked about many many yeah that one right it's the ultra thin i
[01:33:56.480 --> 01:34:00.560]   think you talked about it last week actually and yeah that was that was a pick up for yeah so uh i
[01:34:00.560 --> 01:34:05.920]   you know i have mine too and it's a great stand and so forth this this uh is a full case so it goes
[01:34:05.920 --> 01:34:13.520]   all the way around the back unlike the surface uh keyboard uh and also um has a you know kind of uh
[01:34:13.520 --> 01:34:19.280]   membrane style flat keyboard built into it this wouldn't be good for extensive typing but it's a
[01:34:19.280 --> 01:34:23.440]   lot more compact than a real keyboard you do have to charge it up i think this is gonna be intriguing
[01:34:23.440 --> 01:34:28.640]   i you know we'll see we'll get one extensive typing on an ipad i mean yeah you shouldn't think about it
[01:34:28.640 --> 01:34:33.360]   i think about it and i and i got a zag and i got a logitech and i got all these other things that i
[01:34:33.360 --> 01:34:38.080]   thought i was gonna do all this typing but i never ever actually so i just think this would be great
[01:34:38.080 --> 01:34:42.720]   uh you know so what you may you know it's it's hard to tell until you try something but i like the
[01:34:42.720 --> 01:34:46.880]   idea of it being very very thin so it really just feels like a cover and for the typing that you need
[01:34:46.880 --> 01:34:52.160]   to do you got it it's right there um it's brand new from logitech that just announced it today uh
[01:34:52.160 --> 01:34:58.000]   the logitech fabric skin or fabric skin keyboard folio they've been releasing a lot of great stuff
[01:34:58.000 --> 01:35:02.480]   personally they have haven't they i like logitech i've always liked logitech you know they they
[01:35:02.480 --> 01:35:09.680]   started their swiss company that started making mice uh for uh i think was logo computers was it was
[01:35:09.680 --> 01:35:15.920]   in the earliest days of mice well before uh windows were uh apple were used and let me let me maybe
[01:35:15.920 --> 01:35:23.280]   ruin all the good PR we're about to give them but wasn't that like a 1997 area era usb like logitech
[01:35:23.280 --> 01:35:29.520]   orb uh uh track ball that i saw on uh remember there's there's a picture of kim john um
[01:35:29.520 --> 01:35:34.960]   with a really really antiquated like missile launch system i could swear that i saw a logitech like
[01:35:34.960 --> 01:35:40.320]   i think it was called the orb it was and so that's that that is that is what i look at when i was
[01:35:40.320 --> 01:35:44.400]   like see mad mad man who might have access to nuclear missiles i'm thinking oh that's a real
[01:35:44.400 --> 01:35:49.360]   that's like a 1990 step in it's the easy it was the full track ball but it was a track path yeah it wasn't
[01:35:49.360 --> 01:35:55.920]   super accurate hmm oh it's not ad beam oh my god kim john good is an apple guy they entered
[01:35:55.920 --> 01:36:03.360]   oh let's say probably is that exciting uh uh logitech was in he's probably fresh logitech was
[01:36:03.360 --> 01:36:09.360]   founded in 1981 and they introduced their first mass in 1982 two years before the makatash came out
[01:36:09.360 --> 01:36:14.080]   and uh several years before microsoft windows used a mouse i think it was word that was the first
