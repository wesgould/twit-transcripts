[00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:47.500]   Hello, Leo.
[00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:50.000]   I will try to be newsworthy and appley today for everyone.
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.300]   Yeah, because it's a little bit of a slow.
[00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:56.200]   I say this every week and you're not laughing at me.
[00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:57.200]   Yeah, you could bring me the copy.
[00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:58.600]   This is good. Hello, Andy.
[00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:02.100]   I'm laughing in agreement because I'm looking at the show notes and I'm thinking,
[00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:02.800]   you know what?
[00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:06.300]   This is the one of the weeks where I bet that a research paper that's related
[00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:09.800]   to a story that's always related to an Apple story.
[00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:11.400]   We might be able to talk about that.
[00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:11.400]   Yes.
[00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:14.100]   I do have a story though that you and Renee will like.
[00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:15.100]   I put it in just for you.
[00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:16.100]   Yes, exactly.
[00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.300]   I know.
[00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:16.600]   I saw it.
[00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:17.000]   I think.
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.500]   Yes.
[00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:21.600]   Also from 090.media and office hours.global.
[00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:23.300]   Mr.
[00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:25.400]   There you go.
[00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:32.000]   He's using the real deal eating his planters cheese balls as Mr.
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.900]   Alex from the chopsticks work just as good.
[00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:35.000]   No, not planters.
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.700]   They're not planters.
[00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:36.700]   They're PIP corn.
[00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:39.300]   I decide to know what PIP corn is.
[00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:40.500]   So I just found them.
[00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:41.500]   They're they're pretty good.
[00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:42.000]   There.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.500]   These are real cheddar cheese balls.
[00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:46.200]   20% less fat real cheddar cheese.
[00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:47.300]   They have real cheese in them.
[00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:48.000]   Not fried.
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.400]   Well, look at the back though.
[00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:50.400]   Hair loom.
[00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:51.800]   Hair loom corn.
[00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:54.500]   See what the actual see what the actual ingredients are.
[00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:55.100]   That's the front.
[00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:59.200]   Ingredients are ground cornmeal, sunflower oil and canola oil.
[00:02:59.200 --> 00:02:59.700]   Yeah.
[00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:05.200]   Cheddar cheese, organic way, organic cheddar cheese, organic milk.
[00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:05.500]   Wait a minute.
[00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:08.600]   Is cheddar cheese and then in parenthesis, organic way, cheddar cheese?
[00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:11.200]   Or is it cheddar cheese all by itself?
[00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:14.200]   And how many if you decent cheddar?
[00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:16.700]   Is it a C?
[00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:17.400]   There is Z in the.
[00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:17.900]   The two D's.
[00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:19.100]   But they do.
[00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:19.800]   But they do that thing.
[00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:24.000]   They say cheddar cheese and then they put in parenthesis, cheese way because that's really what's.
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.800]   All I can say is there's nothing in here that I can't pronounce.
[00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:27.700]   That's what.
[00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:32.000]   By the way, this makes them no less horrible for your health.
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:33.200]   Exactly.
[00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:35.000]   But you know, so much better for your hipster.
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:35.700]   I did it.
[00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:37.300]   I did it for the show.
[00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:37.900]   I did it for the show.
[00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:39.000]   There's no way I'm going to eat this whole thing.
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:40.600]   They also have.
[00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:42.900]   I got the cheese.
[00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:43.200]   They have.
[00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:43.900]   They have a.
[00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:44.400]   They have a lab.
[00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:44.900]   He knows.
[00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:48.600]   They have a Filipino which are sesame.
[00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:52.500]   I got to tell you, well, if you're not going to finish this, I'll trade you whatever you don't eat
[00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:56.600]   for that AirPods for that AirPods case that I have with no AirPods in them.
[00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:58.500]   Oh, you can match them with your AirPods.
[00:03:58.500 --> 00:03:59.200]   There you go.
[00:03:59.200 --> 00:03:59.900]   There you go.
[00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:00.700]   I'll send you a bag.
[00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:01.200]   You go.
[00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:02.300]   Anyway, go ahead.
[00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:04.300]   I thought you have some little butter.
[00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:04.500]   Fun.
[00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:05.500]   They're pretty good, actually.
[00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:06.200]   Delicious.
[00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:10.000]   And unfortunately, I have to get rid of them quickly because I am capable of eating all of them.
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:10.900]   Like they're exactly.
[00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:11.900]   They actually are very good.
[00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:12.300]   Yeah.
[00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:15.100]   And I bought, as you know, a case of them.
[00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:19.400]   But I brought them all here just to kill the staff rather than taking these to the office.
[00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:20.100]   I'm going to take you.
[00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:22.400]   Do you have any of those planters, cheese balls?
[00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:23.300]   They're horrible.
[00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:25.500]   Good.
[00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:26.500]   I'll send you some of these ones.
[00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:27.100]   These ones are pretty good.
[00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:27.500]   That's good.
[00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:27.900]   Pretty good.
[00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:30.000]   Oh, yeah.
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:30.900]   That's what I need.
[00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:34.600]   I'm afraid that the chopsticks aren't going to be long enough.
[00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:35.600]   There we go.
[00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:37.800]   I have the grabbers.
[00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:41.300]   It's as if it is as if we worked at a grocery store.
[00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:43.600]   You're going to get the right angle.
[00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:44.400]   I got to get the right angle.
[00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:45.000]   There we go.
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:46.800]   Oh, there we go.
[00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:49.200]   And he's got some too.
[00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:49.900]   Spider-Man, all of us.
[00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:51.800]   Andy, why do you have those?
[00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:53.800]   Because I've got these high ceilings.
[00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:58.400]   It's the only way that I can open and close like some of the curtains to reach out to them.
[00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:04.800]   And so we have these for retrieving hats from my massive hat collection.
[00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:09.700]   It's gone so high now that you have to actually be able to reach the ceiling to grab.
[00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:10.700]   There you go.
[00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:11.200]   I got you.
[00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:12.000]   You don't have a hat problem.
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:12.800]   You have a hat solution.
[00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:13.500]   Oh, man.
[00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:18.900]   I visited my mom, as you know, Andy, because I was near near you and I was in Rhode Island over the week.
[00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:24.500]   And she showed me we were looking at slides and I realized I began the hat collection
[00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:26.300]   when I was like three.
[00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:28.400]   And I had a Feds.
[00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:32.400]   My grandma brought me from Egypt and I had a Spanish matador's hat.
[00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:34.600]   But I realized also the problem.
[00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:38.500]   They were all for a three year old head and as big as my head is.
[00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:39.300]   How to chance.
[00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:42.300]   It wasn't yet fully formed.
[00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:46.300]   So anyway, how's your trip?
[00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:47.400]   Was very nice.
[00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:51.000]   And I'm sorry, Andy, we couldn't get together, but I want every.
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:56.100]   I told you this in the email every drop time with mom because she's 89 going to be 90 in January.
[00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:58.800]   And every moment is precious at this point.
[00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:04.100]   Plus I was busy eating clam cakes and you're a little too low.
[00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:04.300]   You're a little too low.
[00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:05.600]   I couldn't move.
[00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:07.500]   I couldn't move friend.
[00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:15.300]   Yeah, you have six clam cakes and a narrow Gansett beer shandy made with Del's lemonade and you ain't going anywhere for the rest of the day.
[00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:15.700]   That's it.
[00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:16.300]   It's over.
[00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:21.200]   A 30 year old comic book that became a Silicon Valley Bible.
[00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:30.100]   I've read this because of you and Renee, the financial times discovered Scott McCloud's understanding comics.
[00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:32.200]   Yep.
[00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:39.300]   And most interesting thing in the story is apparently this has been kind of the Bible in avatar design.
[00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:53.400]   McCloud has given talks at Google and Pixar blizzard electronic arts at Bitmoji, the cartoon avatar developer in the group that own Snapchat understanding comics is given to every newly recruited artist.
[00:06:53.400 --> 00:07:00.200]   This is our Bible at the studio says Bitmoji founder Bob Blackstock Bob Blackstock.
[00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:07.800]   So I, you know, I just thought, wow, when I saw that because I read this because you said I need to understand comics.
[00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:09.300]   Yes.
[00:07:09.900 --> 00:07:10.900]   It's a wonderful book.
[00:07:10.900 --> 00:07:11.500]   It is.
[00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:13.700]   It's a graphic as much as a comic book.
[00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:27.500]   Yeah, but it was a seminal book like in the eighties about because to basically understanding the entire just like the just like the title says here is how here is the mechanics of how a comic book works, how graphic storytelling works.
[00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:33.300]   That's not just, hey, you start at the top left, you go from left to right and up to down, but mostly telling it.
[00:07:33.300 --> 00:07:42.800]   Well, here's the here is the psychological or the sociological effect of having a panel break that it can denote the passage of time.
[00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:46.100]   It can denote the passage of space and sometimes you can violate these things.
[00:07:46.100 --> 00:08:03.100]   But the thing, but the thing that that I think most of that article was talking about was he made this one page was all about cartooning and how it plays with the brain's ability to recognize faces and to impart previous experience and previous understanding to them.
[00:08:03.100 --> 00:08:06.600]   He has like sort of a sort of a spectrum where it's okay.
[00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:12.800]   So I'm going to draw this picture of a guy and at the very, very one edge of the of the strip is just like a smiley face.
[00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:14.500]   It could be anybody at the other end.
[00:08:14.500 --> 00:08:26.500]   It's a drawing that's almost photo realistic and then he does every sort of transition in between of adding more realism as he goes and making the point that the photo realistic image can only be this one person.
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:41.300]   The person that at the at the other end is so vague, it could be anybody, but in the middle, there's kind of a magic where you recognize a face that might be similar to somebody that you know or relative or something.
[00:08:41.300 --> 00:08:47.600]   And without you even knowing it, you start to impart your own affection, your own understanding to them.
[00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:53.500]   It's the reason why cartoon heads are like a Bugs Bunny or a Saguio Jimbo.
[00:08:53.500 --> 00:09:03.300]   It's an animal head of a character that's kind of acting like a human, but you recognize something from your own experiences of interacting with people in that and that makes it more real.
[00:09:03.300 --> 00:09:15.000]   So yeah, it's it's it's it's key to trying to figure out at what point do we have when you're trying to make an avatar when you're trying to create a simulacrum of another human being in virtual reality or augmented reality,
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:28.900]   how far do you have to go in order to make that emotional connection to that person you're talking to versus being so realistic that if you're one one degree shy of the mark, it becomes creepy.
[00:09:28.900 --> 00:09:36.900]   It does explain why Bitmojis and Mimoji's Apple's version never can look just like me, right?
[00:09:36.900 --> 00:09:42.000]   Yeah, they're they're kind of softened version of you, right?
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:47.400]   Well, and we give it a lot of room when we don't try to hit it right on.
[00:09:47.400 --> 00:10:01.400]   So, so for instance, if you look at metahuman, which is actually mentioned in this article, we've done events where we've done projects where we've used metahuman and we've given it facial capture and and had it do all the things we need to do.
[00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:10.500]   And you just never feel like you can get there and you have the exact same same data and you put it on a meta, you know, like a Mimoji or something like that and it looks totally fine.
[00:10:10.500 --> 00:10:13.600]   You know, and it's just that we have the only county valley.
[00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:14.400]   Is that the issue?
[00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:21.000]   Yeah, it's the uncanny valley and basically as soon as you get close to a realism, our brain immediately goes, okay, is it real?
[00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:22.200]   Something's wrong with that.
[00:10:22.200 --> 00:10:26.900]   And it immediately gets really critical really quickly because we're used to looking at that much data.
[00:10:26.900 --> 00:10:34.900]   Whereas when we back away a little bit, we can make, you know, we give it room because we know it's not real.
[00:10:34.900 --> 00:10:45.100]   And so we don't expect it to be real and then we're just our brain will start as Andy said, we'll start filling in all the other data that we need to make it enjoyable.
[00:10:45.100 --> 00:10:48.400]   But we add that to it and it doesn't have to add.
[00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:51.400]   In the same way people say sometimes it's better to read the book than see the movie.
[00:10:51.400 --> 00:11:00.800]   The movie creates a visual of something that a lot of us imagined some some way very different than what we see and then that realism kind of takes it away.
[00:11:00.800 --> 00:11:09.300]   You know, I was talking to I was watching, oh, it was a song exporter over the weekend with Nine-H nails talking about hurt, you know, with Trent Reznor.
[00:11:09.300 --> 00:11:14.800]   And someone asked like, what does it mean? And he's like, I can't tell you that because people have a meaning for that song or they mean music.
[00:11:14.800 --> 00:11:18.300]   Music and lyrics are especially that way, right? They're very personal.
[00:11:18.300 --> 00:11:23.000]   And he says, I don't want it. You know, you don't need to know what that was about.
[00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:23.500]   Yes.
[00:11:23.500 --> 00:11:24.900]   What's important is what it's about for you.
[00:11:24.900 --> 00:11:26.600]   You know, and so it was really interesting.
[00:11:26.600 --> 00:11:36.500]   It's amazing. I'm sure that McLeod is very happy that his 30 year old book, which is still in print, by the way, is getting the attention from financial times.
[00:11:36.500 --> 00:11:37.500]   That's crazy.
[00:11:37.500 --> 00:11:42.000]   Here's a quote from Matt Graining, the creator of The Simpsons.
[00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:48.500]   "If you've ever felt bad about wasting your life reading comics, check out Scott McLeod's classic book immediately.
[00:11:48.500 --> 00:11:52.800]   You might still feel you've wasted your life, but you'll know why and you'll be proud."
[00:11:52.800 --> 00:12:02.300]   No, he is really the king of academic cartoonists. That sounds like a put to that.
[00:12:02.300 --> 00:12:03.300]   That really sounds bad.
[00:12:03.300 --> 00:12:04.300]   But really changing.
[00:12:04.300 --> 00:12:09.300]   No, but when you think about it, it's like, when Google like that, who really will eyes.
[00:12:09.300 --> 00:12:10.300]   Right.
[00:12:10.300 --> 00:12:12.800]   Well, but again, making people understand.
[00:12:12.800 --> 00:12:22.300]   But what's really interesting is that like when Google released the Chrome browser for the first time, they hired Scott McLeod to basically write a graphic novel.
[00:12:22.300 --> 00:12:26.300]   To explain why here's every technology that goes into a browser.
[00:12:26.300 --> 00:12:28.800]   Here's why things fail and things go well.
[00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:31.300]   Here's why Chrome is supposed to do something better.
[00:12:31.300 --> 00:12:36.800]   They did another recent one that I haven't seen yet with Lucy Bellwood, one of my favorite cartoonists.
[00:12:36.800 --> 00:12:38.800]   I think also teaming up with Scott McLeod.
[00:12:38.800 --> 00:12:44.800]   But I would be amazed to see like what Apple would do to say, here's something we want to explain.
[00:12:44.800 --> 00:12:49.800]   We want to explain our version of augmented reality and security and privacy.
[00:12:49.800 --> 00:12:52.800]   Why don't we hire Lucy Bellwood to explain it for us.
[00:12:52.800 --> 00:12:56.300]   We'll work with her and basically create an AR comic.
[00:12:56.300 --> 00:13:00.800]   Here's the original 2008 Google Chrome comic.
[00:13:00.800 --> 00:13:06.300]   As excited as we are about building Google Chrome, it's important to help all browsers become more powerful.
[00:13:06.300 --> 00:13:08.300]   Human brain, thumbs up, thumbs down.
[00:13:08.300 --> 00:13:10.300]   This is really, this is hysterical.
[00:13:10.300 --> 00:13:11.300]   I love this.
[00:13:11.300 --> 00:13:12.300]   And that's just one page.
[00:13:12.300 --> 00:13:19.800]   For WWDC when they changed the App Store rules, they got a comic book made and given to every developer that explained the new App Store policy.
[00:13:19.800 --> 00:13:24.800]   An old man like me is going to just say, "Well, that's because kids can't read. They need comic books."
[00:13:24.800 --> 00:13:25.800]   Right?
[00:13:25.800 --> 00:13:26.800]   Developers.
[00:13:26.800 --> 00:13:27.800]   Developers.
[00:13:27.800 --> 00:13:31.300]   Here's another quote that will tie it back to Apple.
[00:13:31.300 --> 00:13:38.800]   Andy Hertzfeld, one of the creators of the Mac, one of the most insightful books about designing graphic user interfaces ever written,
[00:13:38.800 --> 00:13:42.800]   even though it never discusses the subject directly.
[00:13:42.800 --> 00:13:44.800]   It's about user interface.
[00:13:44.800 --> 00:13:45.800]   Quite interesting.
[00:13:45.800 --> 00:13:46.800]   Exactly.
[00:13:46.800 --> 00:13:49.800]   Again, it's not just, "Hey, here's how to read a comic book."
[00:13:49.800 --> 00:13:50.800]   It really is.
[00:13:50.800 --> 00:13:52.800]   Here's how the human brain processes visual language.
[00:13:52.800 --> 00:13:55.800]   Here's how we process identity.
[00:13:55.800 --> 00:14:08.300]   And it's like, "My God, I had no idea that the comic books were essentially doing a whole bunch of zero day hacks on my brain to be effective to make me connect to these characters."
[00:14:08.300 --> 00:14:09.300]   Yeah.
[00:14:09.300 --> 00:14:10.300]   Really cool.
[00:14:10.300 --> 00:14:11.300]   Anyway, I threw that in for you guys.
[00:14:11.300 --> 00:14:13.300]   Thank you very much.
[00:14:13.300 --> 00:14:14.300]   God bless you.
[00:14:14.300 --> 00:14:16.300]   Make you feel at home.
[00:14:16.300 --> 00:14:17.300]   Yay.
[00:14:17.300 --> 00:14:25.300]   I don't know how much credence to give this a tweet from Pierre Blazquez.
[00:14:25.300 --> 00:14:27.300]   Do you know Pierre Blazquez Renee?
[00:14:27.300 --> 00:14:28.300]   He's got a French name.
[00:14:28.300 --> 00:14:30.300]   I don't think anybody knows Pierre Blazquez.
[00:14:30.300 --> 00:14:31.300]   Nobody knows Pierre Blazquez.
[00:14:31.300 --> 00:14:35.300]   He's a developer who says, and he won't say where.
[00:14:35.300 --> 00:14:36.300]   What's family knows him?
[00:14:36.300 --> 00:14:37.300]   Yeah, his family.
[00:14:37.300 --> 00:14:39.300]   Mom and Dad remember Pierre, I hope.
[00:14:39.300 --> 00:14:41.300]   He's like, "Chef, nobody understands him."
[00:14:41.300 --> 00:14:43.300]   Why does he want to be mean?
[00:14:43.300 --> 00:14:47.300]   He's not an established leaker that we have a veracity score for yet.
[00:14:47.300 --> 00:15:06.300]   So he claims, even though he won't show anybody where, which is a little weird, that there's publicly downloadable source code repositories that contain mentions of three as yet unreleased Apple devices, a Mac 14, 5, 6, and 8.
[00:15:06.300 --> 00:15:09.300]   Renee, is that credible?
[00:15:09.300 --> 00:15:11.300]   What is that?
[00:15:11.300 --> 00:15:13.300]   I mean, anything is credible.
[00:15:13.300 --> 00:15:14.300]   Usually it's more specific.
[00:15:14.300 --> 00:15:17.300]   It's like MacBook Pro 4, 8, or Mac Pro.
[00:15:17.300 --> 00:15:20.300]   It's an actual name of the Mac, not just a generic Mac.
[00:15:20.300 --> 00:15:23.300]   And if they're going to hide the actual name, why wouldn't they just hide the whole string?
[00:15:23.300 --> 00:15:35.300]   I remember once Apple was having fun with Mark Gurman because he was getting good at finding those strings and they put like, "I prod one comma hamburger or something on the strings just for like a couple of leases."
[00:15:35.300 --> 00:15:37.300]   Take that, Steven Trout Smith.
[00:15:37.300 --> 00:15:39.300]   Yes, exactly.
[00:15:39.300 --> 00:15:42.300]   Or does they put a bunch of ludicrous numbers in there?
[00:15:42.300 --> 00:15:43.300]   Yeah.
[00:15:43.300 --> 00:15:56.300]   Les Keds also says he found code names and identifies from one of the 20 further new variants of the device, including for the iPhone 14, iPhone 15, comma, 2, 3, 4, and 5.
[00:15:56.300 --> 00:15:58.300]   What are you going to do with that?
[00:15:58.300 --> 00:15:59.300]   Nothing.
[00:15:59.300 --> 00:16:00.300]   We know new stuff is coming.
[00:16:00.300 --> 00:16:02.300]   But that does bring me to the question, Renee.
[00:16:02.300 --> 00:16:04.300]   Where the hell is my M2 MacBook Air?
[00:16:04.300 --> 00:16:14.300]   Mac Rumors found a retail source that said, I think they said July 15th, which makes the kind of sense that I usually assume Apple is going to go the last day of the month.
[00:16:14.300 --> 00:16:17.300]   Whenever they say July, it means July 31st at 11.59 pm.
[00:16:17.300 --> 00:16:18.300]   It could be as late as...
[00:16:18.300 --> 00:16:20.300]   Mac Rumors says they have a retail source, yeah.
[00:16:20.300 --> 00:16:23.300]   It says July 15th, and that tracks for me.
[00:16:23.300 --> 00:16:26.300]   Is it supply chain issues?
[00:16:26.300 --> 00:16:28.300]   Is it...what's called...why?
[00:16:28.300 --> 00:16:29.300]   Why?
[00:16:29.300 --> 00:16:31.300]   I've never ever ever ever ever done this.
[00:16:31.300 --> 00:16:36.300]   They do sound like they often the Macs are available like the same week, like the way the MacBook Pro was.
[00:16:36.300 --> 00:16:41.300]   But I think like the 2020s are basically the book of Boba Fett of decades, Leo.
[00:16:41.300 --> 00:16:42.300]   Just nothing went right.
[00:16:42.300 --> 00:16:44.300]   We can't get anything to track on the same timeline.
[00:16:44.300 --> 00:16:47.300]   Everything is like when is it going to be available?
[00:16:47.300 --> 00:16:52.300]   There's still a huge, huge backlog on legacy nodes, which are all those little extra chips that have to go everywhere.
[00:16:52.300 --> 00:16:55.300]   So I think they're just trying to ship as many as they can as fast as they can.
[00:16:55.300 --> 00:16:59.300]   Well, and you may want to wait because according to iMore,
[00:16:59.300 --> 00:17:03.300]   there's some real problems with the M2 MacBook Pro.
[00:17:03.300 --> 00:17:05.300]   Oh, that's all garbage.
[00:17:05.300 --> 00:17:06.300]   It's garbage.
[00:17:06.300 --> 00:17:07.300]   I'm so upset about that, hold on.
[00:17:07.300 --> 00:17:12.300]   Every time a Mac product comes out, there's these cooked up cockamamie catastrophized conspiracy theories now.
[00:17:12.300 --> 00:17:15.300]   And it's getting to the point where I don't even want to cover this stuff anymore.
[00:17:15.300 --> 00:17:19.300]   It's like...this is a Mac tech, which is...I like the Mac tech channel.
[00:17:19.300 --> 00:17:22.300]   They're great, but they got a lot of views off running a bunch of benchmarks.
[00:17:22.300 --> 00:17:28.300]   And they even admitted it on Twitter two days ago that they plan out how the Mac fails videos before they're even released
[00:17:28.300 --> 00:17:29.300]   because they get a lot of views.
[00:17:29.300 --> 00:17:30.300]   It's good for views.
[00:17:30.300 --> 00:17:31.300]   This is why YouTube...
[00:17:31.300 --> 00:17:32.300]   Yeah.
[00:17:32.300 --> 00:17:39.300]   And you're a good YouTuber, but you're the...I guess the...what did they call that?
[00:17:39.300 --> 00:17:40.300]   Exception.
[00:17:40.300 --> 00:17:41.300]   Exception that proves the rule.
[00:17:41.300 --> 00:17:45.300]   So there's a huge Twitter fight today about this where one of the Apple YouTubers is saying,
[00:17:45.300 --> 00:17:46.300]   "I cannot reproduce your results."
[00:17:46.300 --> 00:17:51.300]   And they're saying, "Well, we ran the Rosetta version of this benchmark at the same time as that benchmark."
[00:17:51.300 --> 00:17:53.300]   And they're like, "But then you're deliberately setting up..."
[00:17:53.300 --> 00:17:55.300]   So the other thing is, like, I could make any MacBook fail.
[00:17:55.300 --> 00:17:57.300]   I know exactly how to hurt them.
[00:17:57.300 --> 00:17:59.300]   I know exactly which tests they do well and they do badly.
[00:17:59.300 --> 00:18:06.300]   And the ways that I can hurt them are not a ways that almost any...like maybe 0.1% of customers will ever accidentally come across.
[00:18:06.300 --> 00:18:11.300]   It's just that when you get...like, the whole crux of this one is if you light up every CPU, you're fine.
[00:18:11.300 --> 00:18:16.300]   But if you light up every CPU and every GPU for a long period of time, it's going to ramp down.
[00:18:16.300 --> 00:18:19.300]   And that's exactly expected behavior.
[00:18:19.300 --> 00:18:24.300]   Apple said last year with the M1 that with the MacBook Pro, because it has an active cooling system,
[00:18:24.300 --> 00:18:28.300]   it can sustain longer than the Air, which is fanless, but it's not forever.
[00:18:28.300 --> 00:18:34.300]   You have to go to the Mac Mini if you wanted something big and bulky enough with a big enough fan to sustain indefinitely.
[00:18:34.300 --> 00:18:37.300]   And that's certainly not the MacBook Pro.
[00:18:37.300 --> 00:18:39.300]   So this, if you light the CPU, is you're fine.
[00:18:39.300 --> 00:18:41.300]   Like, it'll just persist with the CPUs.
[00:18:41.300 --> 00:18:46.300]   If you then light up every one of those new GPU cores, it'll go for as long as it can and then it'll ramp down temperature.
[00:18:46.300 --> 00:18:52.300]   Which is the same thing that they were saying with the i9 16-inch MacBook Pro, right?
[00:18:52.300 --> 00:18:56.300]   I mean, and the remember they had to put it in the fridge and all Earthfreezer.
[00:18:56.300 --> 00:19:03.300]   But his temperatures are so high that there is nothing, and I'm asking for one to eat, nobody can even imagine that they...
[00:19:03.300 --> 00:19:08.300]   It just doesn't pull that much power. Like the whole computer doesn't pull that much power.
[00:19:08.300 --> 00:19:11.300]   Well, and it was a problem with the data sets of one.
[00:19:11.300 --> 00:19:16.300]   They took this picture very quickly because he even says it immediately throttled down and cooled off.
[00:19:16.300 --> 00:19:21.300]   So this was a... He also says that heat affects the SSDs.
[00:19:21.300 --> 00:19:23.300]   Is that more of the same?
[00:19:23.300 --> 00:19:27.300]   Heat affects everything. Like, heat affects almost any component.
[00:19:27.300 --> 00:19:29.300]   Heat affects the batteries as well.
[00:19:29.300 --> 00:19:33.300]   But like, the thing is, like, this is why I'm so upset that future has defunded an Antec because an Antec did this right.
[00:19:33.300 --> 00:19:37.300]   And when you benchmark right, like, you have a bunch of units, you draw a bunch of tests.
[00:19:37.300 --> 00:19:39.300]   It's at a control temperature.
[00:19:39.300 --> 00:19:45.300]   It's at, like, you have all the wireless stuff off because wireless can make a huge impact on tests just because radios, they go up and down.
[00:19:45.300 --> 00:19:49.300]   Like, there's a whole bunch of stuff you have to do to make normalized benchmark.
[00:19:49.300 --> 00:19:52.300]   Linus wants to do this with his lab bless his heart. Maybe he can do it.
[00:19:52.300 --> 00:19:53.300]   But it's just...
[00:19:53.300 --> 00:19:59.300]   Everyone wants to make this reliable high-integrity sources to do this who do it right.
[00:19:59.300 --> 00:20:03.300]   Because IDG shut down their lab. PC Max shut down. Like every other lab has been shut down as far as I am.
[00:20:03.300 --> 00:20:07.300]   Patrick Norton was the guy. He was the tester at the CD Labs.
[00:20:07.300 --> 00:20:09.300]   And he's always told me, Leo.
[00:20:09.300 --> 00:20:12.300]   Benchmarks are hard.
[00:20:12.300 --> 00:20:18.300]   They are. They are so hard. And people, especially now, because an SOC isn't like, like, just an Intel chip.
[00:20:18.300 --> 00:20:24.300]   It's got, yeah, E-Cores, P-Cores, G-Cores, like, Neural Engine cores. It's really complicated.
[00:20:24.300 --> 00:20:36.300]   He also, MaxTech also says, this is not a problem they saw with the last generation Macbook Pro.
[00:20:36.300 --> 00:20:41.300]   And it's like, and we... Because he got one test unit and he did one very fast video.
[00:20:41.300 --> 00:20:44.300]   And that's, again, that's one of the problems. It's not a big enough data set.
[00:20:44.300 --> 00:20:50.300]   Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Good. Thank you. I knew. I knew we could count on you.
[00:20:50.300 --> 00:20:54.300]   Well, the problem for me is that, like, all these people watch that video and then come into my comments
[00:20:54.300 --> 00:20:57.300]   and they are so toxic and so angry and so rage-bated.
[00:20:57.300 --> 00:21:03.300]   And I answer as many as I can because I generally feel bad because it's bad for... Like, rage-bating people is bad for them.
[00:21:03.300 --> 00:21:07.300]   It's bad for customers. It's bad for everything. But there's just, like, there's so many of them now.
[00:21:07.300 --> 00:21:09.300]   I just can't keep up.
[00:21:09.300 --> 00:21:15.300]   Well, 'cause I guess the advice we would give to our audience is, you got to consider the source.
[00:21:15.300 --> 00:21:21.300]   Don't believe everything you read. And we need a new anon-tech, I guess.
[00:21:21.300 --> 00:21:27.300]   Are you saying that because future is not giving the money that anon-tech themselves are not as reliable or not as...
[00:21:27.300 --> 00:21:30.300]   Well, though, they just lost everybody. Everybody left.
[00:21:30.300 --> 00:21:36.300]   Ryan's the only one left and he has a part-time writer. They've gone to Intel or Apple and some of them have gone independent.
[00:21:36.300 --> 00:21:39.300]   And it's just like, the best advice I can give is the advice we always give.
[00:21:39.300 --> 00:21:42.300]   And that is, if you buy a new Mac, put it through everything you're going to do.
[00:21:42.300 --> 00:21:46.300]   Put it through the hardest things you're going to do. And if you have any problems, take it back.
[00:21:46.300 --> 00:21:52.300]   But, like, do your workload because your workload is not a bunch of download, run-and-done apps that people get off the internet and barely look at.
[00:21:52.300 --> 00:21:56.300]   Well, but is there any moral that our audience can take?
[00:21:56.300 --> 00:22:00.300]   Should they perhaps wait for a better-cooled M2?
[00:22:00.300 --> 00:22:08.300]   This is such a weird product. This product is basically for people who are going to buy the M1 MacBook Pro and now they can get it with an M2.
[00:22:08.300 --> 00:22:10.300]   Because I don't want to touch bar.
[00:22:10.300 --> 00:22:13.300]   I mean, this is the old MacBook Pro.
[00:22:13.300 --> 00:22:19.300]   Yeah, it's like for enterprise purchasers who buy, like, 2,000 of them and then just give them to their workers.
[00:22:19.300 --> 00:22:20.300]   Yeah, okay.
[00:22:20.300 --> 00:22:23.300]   Everyone else should get the M1 Pro or the MacBook Air.
[00:22:23.300 --> 00:22:32.300]   There's good M1 stuff and there's not such an improvement in M2, especially in these old designs that you would really want to do.
[00:22:32.300 --> 00:22:36.300]   I am super happy. Like, the weird thing is, like, for years people complained that Apple wasn't spec-bumping things.
[00:22:36.300 --> 00:22:39.300]   And I want them to. I want them to spec-bump whenever they can.
[00:22:39.300 --> 00:22:43.300]   Because if you decide, like, if this is the perfect Mac for you, you deserve it with the latest chip.
[00:22:43.300 --> 00:22:47.300]   There's no reason you should have an 18-month-old chip when you buy it. You get the latest chip, so it's great.
[00:22:47.300 --> 00:22:49.300]   It's just not for a lot of people.
[00:22:49.300 --> 00:22:50.300]   Yeah.
[00:22:50.300 --> 00:22:51.300]   Well, thank you for clarifying.
[00:22:51.300 --> 00:22:53.300]   Stop yelling today.
[00:22:53.300 --> 00:22:55.300]   Hey, you're a YouTuber. You got to yell.
[00:22:55.300 --> 00:22:58.300]   If that give us a real good YouTube expression.
[00:22:58.300 --> 00:23:00.300]   Hey, what is up, guys?
[00:23:00.300 --> 00:23:04.300]   No, no, no, no. Like, you know, for this?
[00:23:04.300 --> 00:23:08.300]   I don't know, Leo. I can't do the, you know, like the performative cynical rage theaters.
[00:23:08.300 --> 00:23:11.300]   Giving you the expression. Like, oh, sorry.
[00:23:11.300 --> 00:23:15.300]   Yeah, there you go. Now you put that in the thumbnail.
[00:23:15.300 --> 00:23:17.300]   Your money, baby.
[00:23:17.300 --> 00:23:18.300]   Your money.
[00:23:18.300 --> 00:23:20.300]   I noticed you stopped kind of doing that.
[00:23:20.300 --> 00:23:21.300]   Yeah.
[00:23:21.300 --> 00:23:23.300]   I applaud you, sir. I applaud you.
[00:23:23.300 --> 00:23:25.300]   This will be the new thing.
[00:23:25.300 --> 00:23:31.300]   Avoid YouTube tech videos where somebody's going, some strange expression.
[00:23:31.300 --> 00:23:38.300]   I get it. Like, magazines have, like, people on them with, like, often up to, like, a famous celebrity with, like, some sexy thing on it because that's what people buy.
[00:23:38.300 --> 00:23:39.300]   People buy.
[00:23:39.300 --> 00:23:40.300]   It's talking our brain.
[00:23:40.300 --> 00:23:43.300]   We're humans. We're animals. We're easily fooled.
[00:23:43.300 --> 00:23:45.300]   What's a magazine, Renee?
[00:23:45.300 --> 00:23:46.300]   What is that?
[00:23:46.300 --> 00:23:48.300]   I think you get in PDF.
[00:23:48.300 --> 00:23:52.300]   Do we? I'm curious. I was thinking about this over the weekend.
[00:23:52.300 --> 00:23:55.300]   Who reads magazines now? I mean, what I mean by that is...
[00:23:55.300 --> 00:23:58.300]   You used to, I remember going to the airport with you, Mr. Alex Lindsey.
[00:23:58.300 --> 00:24:02.300]   You'd go to the airport shop. You'd come back with a stack, a foot high.
[00:24:02.300 --> 00:24:03.300]   Read them on the flight.
[00:24:03.300 --> 00:24:05.300]   The economist. You'd read them all on the flight.
[00:24:05.300 --> 00:24:07.300]   Yeah. Yeah. And, and...
[00:24:07.300 --> 00:24:14.300]   I don't, because I, you know, I'm like, well, I have my phone and then I have these magazines on the phone, but I don't actually, like, reading them on the phone.
[00:24:14.300 --> 00:24:25.300]   Like, I, and then I find myself like not, like, it's, it's, it's, it's an, I've noticed that I, because they're available electronically, I try to download them electronically, but I don't actually read them electronically.
[00:24:25.300 --> 00:24:38.300]   And I just kind of want them to be, you know, like, no, but it's, it's like a weird, like, I, I've just noticed this thing about that I, because as you know, as you just stated, I used to read a lot of magazines and, and the, and now I mostly listen to them.
[00:24:38.300 --> 00:24:40.300]   You know, like, if they don't have an audio portion.
[00:24:40.300 --> 00:24:43.300]   Do you use on them? What do you use to listen to them?
[00:24:43.300 --> 00:24:48.860]   listen to them. I listen to them. Most of my listen through their own app ironically, so
[00:24:48.860 --> 00:24:52.860]   I listened to the two that I listened to, probably the most are the economists and foreign affairs,
[00:24:52.860 --> 00:24:58.820]   and so those are those are my two things that I listen to while I'm not doing this. And so
[00:24:58.820 --> 00:25:04.060]   those both have their own, "The Economist" is great because they do it every- I hate
[00:25:04.060 --> 00:25:07.860]   the little music things that they do, but they otherwise they, I mean just want them to say
[00:25:07.860 --> 00:25:13.140]   that the foreign affairs does it better because they just do the thing, right? But the, so
[00:25:13.140 --> 00:25:18.060]   "Economists" if you listen to the entire " Economist" in audio, the audio, the music
[00:25:18.060 --> 00:25:23.380]   hits drive you crazy. The problem with the foreign affairs is that they are months behind.
[00:25:23.380 --> 00:25:25.100]   Oh, that's terrible.
[00:25:25.100 --> 00:25:29.780]   So they don't get- it's very evergreen. I mean you can listen to the foreign affairs
[00:25:29.780 --> 00:25:32.500]   for like six months ago and it's just talking about that.
[00:25:32.500 --> 00:25:33.860]   Yeah, I guess that's true.
[00:25:33.860 --> 00:25:38.740]   But the, "Economists" though, so those are the two that I probably listened to the most,
[00:25:38.740 --> 00:25:43.380]   and then Apple has a ton of stuff that they've been adding. In fact, in the, in foreign affairs
[00:25:43.380 --> 00:25:51.140]   you'll hear stuff made for by Apple, you know, this is what this was provided by Apple, audio,
[00:25:51.140 --> 00:25:55.660]   or whatever, and other ones are paid for by NOAA, which I don't know what that is. Anyway,
[00:25:55.660 --> 00:26:01.900]   so the news on air, I think is what it is. Anyway, news on, in audio, news on audio.
[00:26:01.900 --> 00:26:07.460]   Anyway, so anyway, so I find myself listening to a lot of them, which I like. I listen to
[00:26:07.460 --> 00:26:09.660]   a lot of audio books, so that's easy.
[00:26:09.660 --> 00:26:13.620]   It's funny because you don't have a commute, so you're just doing this around the house
[00:26:13.620 --> 00:26:16.780]   and your slippers, you slide around and listen to foreign affairs.
[00:26:16.780 --> 00:26:20.900]   To clean my, to clean the pool filter is about two hours.
[00:26:20.900 --> 00:26:21.900]   Oh, wow, it's like a-
[00:26:21.900 --> 00:26:22.900]   And that's when I listened to-
[00:26:22.900 --> 00:26:23.900]   Yeah.
[00:26:23.900 --> 00:26:26.740]   And I, and I listened to everything at about 1.75, so-
[00:26:26.740 --> 00:26:29.340]   So is this the Foreign Affairs magazine app?
[00:26:29.340 --> 00:26:30.340]   Yeah.
[00:26:30.340 --> 00:26:35.300]   It has audio. It has audio, but it's, it's a horror. Like someone really needs to go back
[00:26:35.300 --> 00:26:38.380]   and redesign it. It's the, it's the dumbest. I mean, it took me a little while to figure
[00:26:38.380 --> 00:26:42.620]   out like the, the science. I've been reading Florida Ferris since I was like 12. So, so
[00:26:42.620 --> 00:26:46.940]   I like it, like my parents got it and I just grew up reading it. So I couldn't understand
[00:26:46.940 --> 00:26:50.700]   until I was about this age. Why? All the text was so big. Like I was like-
[00:26:50.700 --> 00:26:52.500]   It's for old people, Alex.
[00:26:52.500 --> 00:26:58.340]   It was so funny. That's a kid. I was like, this is like made for five year olds. I was
[00:26:58.340 --> 00:26:59.340]   like, this is made for five year olds.
[00:26:59.340 --> 00:27:02.340]   It's like, why are they making the text for five year olds? And now that I'm, now that I'm-
[00:27:02.340 --> 00:27:03.340]   Now you appreciate it.
[00:27:03.340 --> 00:27:04.340]   Yeah.
[00:27:04.340 --> 00:27:05.340]   In fact, now you've switched to audio.
[00:27:05.340 --> 00:27:06.340]   That's right.
[00:27:06.340 --> 00:27:08.340]   Because it's, the text is, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's.
[00:27:08.340 --> 00:27:13.300]   I want to recommend, I know you probably familiar with it, but I really like Oodm, A U D M. It's
[00:27:13.300 --> 00:27:19.700]   an app for iOS that has the Atlantic, ProPublica, the newer, it's all liberal stuff. Vanity Fair,
[00:27:19.700 --> 00:27:21.500]   New York, New Yorker, Wired's in it.
[00:27:21.500 --> 00:27:23.340]   And do they do all the articles?
[00:27:23.340 --> 00:27:27.820]   I don't think they do all, but they do some, my, I guess they do so many. I don't have
[00:27:27.820 --> 00:27:29.820]   a word to say, oh, wow, I wish they had more.
[00:27:29.820 --> 00:27:30.820]   Right.
[00:27:30.820 --> 00:27:34.820]   And they have, they do real narrators. It's not auto generated or anything like that. So.
[00:27:34.820 --> 00:27:40.620]   Well, that's both both for the foreign affairs and, and economists, they, to real. And then
[00:27:40.620 --> 00:27:45.460]   the Apple ones, the Apple ones that you see in Apple news, wow, that is some great production.
[00:27:45.460 --> 00:27:49.820]   Like they, you know, they definitely- What is the story there? Because Apple, we were
[00:27:49.820 --> 00:27:53.620]   talking about this on Sunday. Glenn Fleischman was on and he said, yeah, Apple hired up
[00:27:53.620 --> 00:27:59.740]   a bunch of people. A lot of people we know, like Serenity Caldwell, during the kind of
[00:27:59.740 --> 00:28:05.260]   great depression for online publications. There were a lot of people looking for work,
[00:28:05.260 --> 00:28:09.380]   and Apple hired a lot of them. But, but I remember they hired Nathan Oliver as Giles
[00:28:09.380 --> 00:28:15.100]   away from us. And then they just seen, Serenity hasn't, because the WWDC, but she only seems
[00:28:15.100 --> 00:28:18.060]   to emerge once a year. It seems like they're, they're-
[00:28:18.060 --> 00:28:19.860]   Like tell us to make each one, Leo.
[00:28:19.860 --> 00:28:23.500]   Yeah, maybe. No, they're making them day in, day in, day of. So where are all these
[00:28:23.500 --> 00:28:25.420]   people going? I mean, what's happening?
[00:28:25.420 --> 00:28:28.260]   He does the tech talks too though. So like she does, like all the tech talks you see
[00:28:28.260 --> 00:28:30.980]   during the year. So she maybe does take a year to do that. Yeah.
[00:28:30.980 --> 00:28:34.100]   Yeah, it's all developed. So Apple news is where they are. I mean, where are all these
[00:28:34.100 --> 00:28:38.700]   content people? Mostly, I know a lot of people that are in Apple news right now. Apple, Apple
[00:28:38.700 --> 00:28:42.620]   news, because there's a lot of curation. There's a lot of people who are working in the App Store,
[00:28:42.620 --> 00:28:44.300]   who write those articles about, Hey, here's-
[00:28:44.300 --> 00:28:46.380]   That's what Glenn said. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:28:46.380 --> 00:28:53.460]   Absolutely. There's also a bunch of people who are just in the developer, developer stuff
[00:28:53.460 --> 00:28:56.740]   that are basically writing documentation, editing documentation, that sort of stuff.
[00:28:56.740 --> 00:29:03.420]   And Apple news has audio. In the app. Oh yeah, Apple news, audio stories. The stories you
[00:29:03.420 --> 00:29:07.980]   need to hear everywhere you want to listen. Oh, this is cool. You saw the eyes of the
[00:29:07.980 --> 00:29:12.820]   writers? I've subscribed to it because I have Apple One, but I've never listened to it.
[00:29:12.820 --> 00:29:15.820]   Well, I realize there's a lot of magazines that, you know, Apple's doing more, where
[00:29:15.820 --> 00:29:19.140]   you see more articles from different places that are in audio. I was like, if they just
[00:29:19.140 --> 00:29:22.620]   took on the whole, like the reason that I like it is, because what frustrates me is
[00:29:22.620 --> 00:29:27.100]   to go to an article. If you start providing audio, the problem is, then I get into a habit
[00:29:27.100 --> 00:29:34.100]   of, oh, I can listen to this while I'm cleaning or doing whatever I'm doing. And suddenly,
[00:29:34.100 --> 00:29:37.260]   if I don't have that article that I want to read, I don't want to read it anymore.
[00:29:37.260 --> 00:29:42.300]   That's what I noticed is that once I have the easier way to absorb the information, I
[00:29:42.300 --> 00:29:45.780]   don't want the old one anymore. And I just get frustrated and I stop reading it. You know,
[00:29:45.780 --> 00:29:48.700]   like it's not like I go, oh, I'm going to listen to that out loud because publications
[00:29:48.700 --> 00:29:54.140]   are going to go, we better not make audio free. So far. Well, I just think that, you know,
[00:29:54.140 --> 00:29:56.780]   we have been, there's been a bunch of us that have been talking about the fact that
[00:29:56.780 --> 00:30:01.540]   we would have listened to magazines for the last three decades. You know, I spent, it's
[00:30:01.540 --> 00:30:04.940]   funny that the first conversation we really got into that was my, I was talking to my
[00:30:04.940 --> 00:30:09.180]   uncle who he spends a lot of time on a tractor, you know, plowing fields. And he's like, man,
[00:30:09.180 --> 00:30:12.340]   I wish all the farm magazines were not, you know, and we actually tried to work on a business
[00:30:12.340 --> 00:30:15.940]   plan like 30 years ago because it was just like, that would be great. Sure. You live
[00:30:15.940 --> 00:30:20.740]   in a combine during harvest season, right? Yeah. And so, so it, and so you, there's all
[00:30:20.740 --> 00:30:24.300]   these things, there's all this downtime that you want to fill with. Some people want to
[00:30:24.300 --> 00:30:28.860]   fill with information. And so especially when you're doing something that's frustrating,
[00:30:28.860 --> 00:30:34.460]   like cleaning your pool, you know, like it's, it's, it's, it's nice to be at least feeling
[00:30:34.460 --> 00:30:38.340]   like something. I listen to audio books when I'm gaming because then I don't feel like
[00:30:38.340 --> 00:30:44.460]   I'm throwing my life away. I don't think I could do that. Although, although I only play
[00:30:44.460 --> 00:30:47.860]   one game, I don't think I can't even listen to people around me when I'm playing it because
[00:30:47.860 --> 00:30:52.740]   I got to make so many decisions so quickly. I just got portal on the switch, which is one
[00:30:52.740 --> 00:30:57.740]   of my one of the all time great games, a portal companion. $20 by the way, on the switch.
[00:30:57.740 --> 00:30:59.980]   And it's really playable in the switch. So now I have something.
[00:30:59.980 --> 00:31:05.620]   It's a lie. Yeah. Yeah. It's a, the portal is not a lie. All right. Let's take Colton's
[00:31:05.620 --> 00:31:09.420]   music for that or title high on my favorite playlist. Oh, the first thing I did when I
[00:31:09.420 --> 00:31:13.780]   down, while I was downloading portals, play still alive. I said, yeah, hey, you know who
[00:31:13.780 --> 00:31:20.140]   played still alive. Oh, I love that song. So good. Oh, I should be remiss if I didn't
[00:31:20.140 --> 00:31:24.620]   plan out that. Trinity also does the Apple developer app. So anytime that's updated,
[00:31:24.620 --> 00:31:27.980]   that's all her work too. Well, with her working with other people to keep it up to
[00:31:27.980 --> 00:31:33.220]   should mention that Ian Cutress who did leave a non tech, our chat room informs me,
[00:31:33.220 --> 00:31:39.780]   has his own YouTube channel, Tech Tech Potato. Yeah, it's delightful. So is he doing the same
[00:31:39.780 --> 00:31:44.500]   kind of thing or is it more? I see the expressions. He's doing consulting and YouTube videos.
[00:31:44.500 --> 00:31:50.220]   So like try to try to, oh, it's all right. We're going to impose some sanity upon all
[00:31:50.220 --> 00:31:56.620]   the, he's got apparently an interview with the person who runs the Lanai cat sanctuary,
[00:31:56.620 --> 00:32:04.700]   as well as AMD could demolish Intel in this market. That's eclectic. Is that what we look
[00:32:04.700 --> 00:32:08.980]   at? And then he's interviewing the head of media tech on their Wi-Fi chip. And yeah,
[00:32:08.980 --> 00:32:14.020]   well, that's like the last few Apple reviews is at Qualcomm now. So he's not going to be
[00:32:14.020 --> 00:32:18.180]   doing right M2 review. So I don't know who will like, well, Ryan Ryan's great, but he
[00:32:18.180 --> 00:32:23.500]   has like a ton of PCs to review. Yeah, they hired Alan Milavantana and Ryan Shraut and
[00:32:23.500 --> 00:32:28.540]   decimated PC perspective. And on went to Apple. I mean,
[00:32:28.540 --> 00:32:35.580]   not went to Apple. Yeah, again, disappeared. It's just disappointing. I know we need to
[00:32:35.580 --> 00:32:43.140]   get to commercial, but it's we need a lot more truly independent reviews, truly independent
[00:32:43.140 --> 00:32:47.460]   reporting, because there are a lot of it is a lot of the attention of these companies
[00:32:47.460 --> 00:32:53.500]   has moved towards YouTube. And the YouTube creators, Renee, Renee accepted. There are
[00:32:53.500 --> 00:32:58.220]   many YouTube creators that are under a lot of pressure to say, Hey, if Apple invites me
[00:32:58.220 --> 00:33:03.100]   to have an exclusive interview under the under these extremely limited conditions in which
[00:33:03.100 --> 00:33:08.140]   we are just there to promote. But was what they announced at WWDC. No, we can't ask
[00:33:08.140 --> 00:33:14.220]   about labor. No, we can't ask about COVID return to work stuff. It becomes a situation
[00:33:14.220 --> 00:33:19.340]   in which the independent conversation becomes really, really easy for these companies to
[00:33:19.340 --> 00:33:26.340]   manipulate. And so it was so it was there was a sort of a golden age in which a site
[00:33:26.340 --> 00:33:30.980]   like an on tech was making enough money in and of itself that it's nice if Apple was
[00:33:30.980 --> 00:33:35.260]   going to help them is nice if Google is if Intel is going to help them out. But if not,
[00:33:35.260 --> 00:33:37.980]   they'll just they'll just get the chips on their own. They'll just do their own tests
[00:33:37.980 --> 00:33:44.180]   on their own, because they just are not beholden to anybody for for PR for marketing for accessibility
[00:33:44.180 --> 00:33:49.580]   I'll go a further like Apple at the very least does refuses to pay for consultants. They
[00:33:49.580 --> 00:33:54.900]   refuse to pay for media. They refuse to pay for any of that where Qualcomm Intel Samsung
[00:33:54.900 --> 00:33:59.900]   will do sponsored videos. And you know, I have no reason people put big ethical statements
[00:33:59.900 --> 00:34:04.780]   up there. I have no reason to doubt anything but like they're sponsoring the video. So
[00:34:04.780 --> 00:34:08.940]   I would add though, Renee Apple doesn't pay because they don't have to. People are so
[00:34:08.940 --> 00:34:14.100]   happy to get Tim Cook talking to them. They don't have to. Also, Apple is a direct to
[00:34:14.100 --> 00:34:18.460]   consumer company where Qualcomm and Samsung SLI for example, aren't like they just want
[00:34:18.460 --> 00:34:22.300]   to be seen and nobody's people will write a do a video about a Samsung phone, but not
[00:34:22.300 --> 00:34:26.140]   going to do a video about Qualcomm because what he sees it's welcome wants the attention
[00:34:26.140 --> 00:34:29.940]   and they they market for it. They have to want you to know it's Samsung inside like it's
[00:34:29.940 --> 00:34:34.740]   all on to Intel inside. Yeah. Yeah. All I'm saying is that my eyes roll a bit whenever
[00:34:34.740 --> 00:34:41.180]   I see like even a YouTuber that I really respect say, Hey, look, Qualcomm just sent me this
[00:34:41.180 --> 00:34:47.380]   this giant gingerbread cake in the shape of their new chip. Isn't this wacky? Okay. And
[00:34:47.380 --> 00:34:53.300]   look, see, here's the SOC and here's the copeprocess that does all the really I don't like the
[00:34:53.300 --> 00:34:57.420]   Chinese reviews are really good. Like if you can find them, I'll send you some, but the
[00:34:57.420 --> 00:35:01.520]   Chinese reviewers, they have so much stuff that they're on nobody's payroll. They're completely
[00:35:01.520 --> 00:35:06.120]   based. They don't care about anything anymore. And they do the absolute best benchmarking
[00:35:06.120 --> 00:35:11.160]   you've ever seen and they're just brutal. It is it is in Chinese. Some summer, Mandarin
[00:35:11.160 --> 00:35:16.800]   summer in English, some are like that you can get like the call to close captions in English,
[00:35:16.800 --> 00:35:20.360]   but they are so good. There's no emotional about it. They're very
[00:35:20.360 --> 00:35:25.880]   up. What's it? Give me. We're take a break. We'll send back. Just give me a couple of names
[00:35:25.880 --> 00:35:33.040]   so we can tell our audience. We can give you a I'll give you a moment to do that. I think
[00:35:33.040 --> 00:35:36.520]   some of this is because the air is kind of going out of the room on digital advertising,
[00:35:36.520 --> 00:35:41.760]   right? And all of these guys are suffering because at Google and Facebook, just sucking
[00:35:41.760 --> 00:35:46.880]   the air out of the room. And if you can't monetize, you can't hire a staff. You can't
[00:35:46.880 --> 00:35:50.120]   do this kind of journalism. It's the same thing has been happening in newspapers for
[00:35:50.120 --> 00:35:56.760]   the last five, 10 years. So oh, well, you can still watch us until they suck the air at
[00:35:56.760 --> 00:36:05.680]   us. Fortunately, we have a very nice set of advertisers who keep us going. Renee Richie,

[00:38:11.240 --> 00:38:13.920]   one in my, I'm trying to find his English channel. I put his Chinese channel in my pick
[00:38:13.920 --> 00:38:17.640]   of the week slot so you can find it. Oh, okay. You don't have to make that your pick of the
[00:38:17.640 --> 00:38:22.840]   week if you don't want to. But you could and we'll save it. Okay, sure, absolutely.

[00:38:26.200 --> 00:38:33.400]   by then. Awesome. Here's I Fix It's teardown. Now here's real news. Thank you, I Fix It.
[00:38:33.400 --> 00:38:37.160]   You know, at least they've got a business model that keeps them going. And I know Kyle
[00:38:37.160 --> 00:38:43.080]   Waines and company are very independent, bloody minded. So I trust them. They call
[00:38:43.080 --> 00:38:45.760]   themselves, and they used to be a response, or I don't think maybe they still aren't.
[00:38:45.760 --> 00:38:50.400]   They call themselves the repair manual for the internet. They have torn down the M2
[00:38:50.400 --> 00:38:56.920]   Mac book pro. They say it's just a recycled laptop with the new chip inside. Actually,
[00:38:56.920 --> 00:39:01.240]   this is not the I Fix It. Were we surprised at that? No, we knew that, right? We knew
[00:39:01.240 --> 00:39:08.720]   that. Yeah. That they took the old body and chassis and where is it here? Oh gosh, you
[00:39:08.720 --> 00:39:15.360]   know, let's do M2. I saw that and I was like, and, and did you, did you look at the outside
[00:39:15.360 --> 00:39:20.560]   of it? It looks exactly like the old one. Yeah. Yeah. Is there there's a video? It's
[00:39:20.560 --> 00:39:29.440]   the A2338. Here's the video. Okay. We're pretty sure they say we just tore down the new M2
[00:39:29.440 --> 00:39:35.760]   pro. That positive, but pretty sure updated the M1 to M2 on the outside. You're kidding.
[00:39:35.760 --> 00:39:41.160]   There is to be really? Wow. I mean, they got a ship right away, Leo. Got a ship. So maybe
[00:39:41.160 --> 00:39:45.680]   that's why it's available so fast. Okay. Yeah. I mean, changing the chip is one thing changing
[00:39:45.680 --> 00:39:50.080]   like the industrial design of a computer and the replication of it and building it out
[00:39:50.080 --> 00:39:55.360]   and everything else is not trivial. So it would have delayed the whole thing by probably
[00:39:55.360 --> 00:40:00.640]   six months to a year. I mean, but isn't the M2 bigger? I mean, you can't just slot it in
[00:40:00.640 --> 00:40:04.240]   or could you? No, someone tried, look me on. He tried to change the chips. Doesn't work.
[00:40:04.240 --> 00:40:09.360]   Yeah. It's a new motherboard and new logic board. Yeah. Yeah. But is the logic board the
[00:40:09.360 --> 00:40:13.920]   same dimensions as the old one? I think. Okay. Well, that would make it easier.
[00:40:13.920 --> 00:40:17.640]   He's a bunch of other things. Oh, yeah. Here's the old one. Here's the new one. Yeah, they're
[00:40:17.640 --> 00:40:23.160]   very similar. Okay, I get it. In fact, they look identical. I can see, I see, I can see
[00:40:23.160 --> 00:40:30.760]   the confusion. Anyway, good video as usual from from I fix it and I guess they'll have
[00:40:30.760 --> 00:40:36.040]   parts and repair. You know, you can't we talked, you know, Micah did this thing where
[00:40:36.040 --> 00:40:44.720]   he got the official Apple repair and got the $149.76 Pelican cases and all that. You can
[00:40:44.720 --> 00:40:51.520]   still go to I fix it and get the part and get like cheaper ways to do it like their microwavable
[00:40:51.520 --> 00:40:56.880]   bolster that you used to soften the glue and things. Yeah. So I presume that they'll continue
[00:40:56.880 --> 00:41:02.160]   to offer that. I hope they will, even though Apple's now doing the more fancy way of doing
[00:41:02.160 --> 00:41:08.520]   it. All right. So nothing more to say, but thank you. I fix it for doing that.
[00:41:08.520 --> 00:41:15.800]   Yeah. I love the idea of them doing like kids doing the same thing that I was doing like
[00:41:15.800 --> 00:41:21.200]   with Apple two E's where it's like, yeah, you're I figured out how to fix hard fix disk drives
[00:41:21.200 --> 00:41:25.720]   and so like my side business was like people would bring their disk drives from home and
[00:41:25.720 --> 00:41:29.360]   I would take them. I would take them home. My dad would drive me to you do electronics
[00:41:29.360 --> 00:41:35.600]   and need them right by like 72 seven to VLS like dual Scotty chips, which is usually
[00:41:35.600 --> 00:41:40.520]   what blew out of them. And it'd be great if like there 11 12 13 year olds who have a
[00:41:40.520 --> 00:41:44.680]   side business not scoop an ice cream, not flipping burgers, but basically repairing
[00:41:44.680 --> 00:41:49.520]   iPhone 13s. I didn't know you used to do that. That's so cute. And he had a side
[00:41:49.520 --> 00:41:55.560]   hole. Baby Andy had a side how old were you? Did that 12? 12 11 or 12 actually actually
[00:41:55.560 --> 00:42:01.840]   was even worse than that. Because to also as part of my ongoing public school policy
[00:42:01.840 --> 00:42:05.600]   of ingracing myself with authority so that they would not think that no, there's no
[00:42:05.600 --> 00:42:10.440]   way that Andy did that thing he was excused of on like during like Easter vacation stuff
[00:42:10.440 --> 00:42:15.280]   like any I would take like all the broken like computers home with me and I would fix
[00:42:15.280 --> 00:42:19.160]   them and bring them back the next week and would take me maybe a day to get them running
[00:42:19.160 --> 00:42:23.200]   and then for the rest of the week, my friends would come over and we'd use like these like
[00:42:23.200 --> 00:42:29.040]   eight Apple two E's on like 16 disc drives to basically pirate every game we could possibly
[00:42:29.040 --> 00:42:34.800]   get our hands on. It didn't help them explain why a sixth grader had massive sideburns,
[00:42:34.800 --> 00:42:38.780]   but at least they didn't suspect protect chops anymore. Right? They were they were
[00:42:38.780 --> 00:42:44.920]   paced ons at that point. I was there they're transitional ones, you know, my mom wouldn't
[00:42:44.920 --> 00:42:48.840]   sign off on the they need to get your parents to signature just like on a tattoo. I did
[00:42:48.840 --> 00:42:56.280]   by the way, Andy, I did visit the Ambrose Burnside statue in Providence, Rhode Island was across
[00:42:56.280 --> 00:43:03.080]   from my hotel and I gave him a little I gave him a little salute. Are you in your honor?
[00:43:03.080 --> 00:43:09.080]   The I think I think sideburns are named after Burnside. I think I think yep famous for his
[00:43:09.080 --> 00:43:14.520]   mutton chops. Yeah. And if you think the thing is like to have to maintain my my federal
[00:43:14.520 --> 00:43:20.200]   mutton chop license, I do have to have a horse. And that it's worth it. I mean, and she's
[00:43:20.200 --> 00:43:27.960]   a good horse, but you know, that's a commitment, man. I stayed in the old built more, you know,
[00:43:27.960 --> 00:43:32.480]   L.A. has a built more. A number of cities had built more ZZ in the I guess in the thirties
[00:43:32.480 --> 00:43:37.360]   were like the fancy hotel in town and then these big lobbies with big chandeliers and
[00:43:37.360 --> 00:43:43.160]   they have balls and stuff. And it's now called the graduate. It's kind of a ghost town. I
[00:43:43.160 --> 00:43:48.200]   think COVID has hit it hard. We parked in the parking there official parking garage and
[00:43:48.200 --> 00:43:52.440]   it looked like there was a pathway into the hotel and I asked the desk clerk, she said,
[00:43:52.440 --> 00:43:57.560]   yeah, we sold that garage a couple of years ago. You can't and closed off the pathway. You can't go
[00:43:57.560 --> 00:44:04.440]   through the pathway. But it's kind of a tribute to Brown University graduates. So there's pictures
[00:44:04.440 --> 00:44:11.400]   on the wall in every room of brown famous brown alumni in their college days like David
[00:44:11.400 --> 00:44:15.560]   Byrne and Laura Lenny. A bunch of people I had no idea, but I'm sure they were famous.
[00:44:15.560 --> 00:44:20.360]   No, it's it's it's an interesting downtown because it's it must have been like a beautiful
[00:44:20.360 --> 00:44:28.040]   downtown in the 1930s the 1940s. But now like you have this beautiful like 1930s building the
[00:44:28.040 --> 00:44:32.920]   Superman building because they call the Superman building the model for the right. It's the daily
[00:44:32.920 --> 00:44:36.760]   planet. I looked down my window. I said, there's the daily planet, everything but the planet.
[00:44:37.320 --> 00:44:41.960]   Yeah. And you can see you can see it. It's the only piece of like Providence or architecture you
[00:44:41.960 --> 00:44:47.480]   can see in the backgrounds of a family guy. And the thing is like it is vacant. It is like this
[00:44:47.480 --> 00:44:53.800]   massive building and the entire thing is completely vacant because every time there's a
[00:44:53.800 --> 00:44:58.200]   every time there's a redevelopment plan for it, there's like, here's how much is going to cost for
[00:44:58.200 --> 00:45:03.880]   asbestos abatement. Here's how much it's going to be to like upgrade the plumbing upgrade to the
[00:45:03.880 --> 00:45:09.880]   heating and ventilation system and everybody backs down from it. So it has to be and and it's saving
[00:45:09.880 --> 00:45:14.520]   the only reason why it's still sticking around is because it's all this big beautiful cement.
[00:45:14.520 --> 00:45:19.160]   It would cost so much money to tear it down. I had no idea. So it's completely empty.
[00:45:19.160 --> 00:45:24.360]   You can occasionally see at night, you can see like a beautiful brilliant skyline with like
[00:45:24.360 --> 00:45:29.640]   in this huge building with one light on and it's probably just like one and then there's and
[00:45:29.640 --> 00:45:35.640]   that's like the perennial thing, the discussion every three years is a new plan on what to do
[00:45:35.640 --> 00:45:41.080]   with this building, how to revitalize that area. It's very interesting because there are because
[00:45:41.080 --> 00:45:46.840]   RISD is right there. It is sort of a pet project for everybody who's in design. It's a great school.
[00:45:46.840 --> 00:45:51.400]   Yeah. And so there are all these brilliant plans for here's what we can do to this downtown area
[00:45:51.400 --> 00:45:56.760]   because you've been there. It's everything is right there. It's nicer than when I was a kid. It was
[00:45:56.760 --> 00:46:03.320]   kind of dumpy when I was a kid. In fact, they they put asphalt over the river. There is a river
[00:46:03.320 --> 00:46:08.120]   goes through Providence and it made the Guinness Book of World Records as the world's widest
[00:46:08.120 --> 00:46:12.680]   fridge because they basically papered over the whole river in the 90s. Fortunately,
[00:46:12.680 --> 00:46:16.680]   they took that out and the river is beautiful now. There's a lot of beautiful stuff. Burnside Park
[00:46:16.680 --> 00:46:23.160]   is very beautiful. But yeah, it's maybe it's kind of it's a little better than when I was a kid, I guess.
[00:46:23.160 --> 00:46:28.440]   Yeah. And it is a little and it is still a little sketchy. It's like it's not a great place to hang
[00:46:28.440 --> 00:46:32.040]   out at night. No. When you walk through there like just waiting for your bus or waiting for your
[00:46:32.040 --> 00:46:36.680]   train, it's like you will you will you will you will smell people getting herbered up. Yeah, there's a lot
[00:46:36.680 --> 00:46:41.400]   of there was a lot of herbalism going on. Yeah, I'm thinking if we can get enough members of club
[00:46:41.400 --> 00:46:47.400]   Twit, we could buy this building, put the Twit logo at the top. It'd be interesting to put compound
[00:46:47.400 --> 00:46:56.280]   rotating. Yeah. So all it takes is your seven dollars. Go to twit.tv/club twit. Join today.
[00:46:56.280 --> 00:47:01.800]   And if a hundred thousand of you notes could take more than that. If 200,000 of you join,
[00:47:01.800 --> 00:47:08.280]   we will buy the Superman building. There you go. It'll be the Twit World headquarters. How about that?
[00:47:08.280 --> 00:47:15.640]   How about that? It's a yeah, it was fun. Anyway, I waved at Major Burnside, Major General Burnside,
[00:47:15.640 --> 00:47:20.520]   as I as I went by. What did how did you start, Alex? When you were a kid,
[00:47:20.520 --> 00:47:25.720]   what got you into Techno? I know you were reading for Affairs magazine. Was there any
[00:47:25.720 --> 00:47:32.760]   computer stuff going on there? Yeah, my grandfather was my grandfather built a radio in 1921 to get
[00:47:32.760 --> 00:47:38.200]   to pick up the first broadcast from the KDA. Crystal radio set. Yeah. In 1921 to pick up the
[00:47:38.200 --> 00:47:42.440]   first commercial broadcast. It was like a World Series, I think in 1920. KDA. Yeah. Yeah. And he
[00:47:42.440 --> 00:47:48.120]   was in Signal Corps in World War II. So he was like, I mean, he ended up at West Point teaching
[00:47:48.120 --> 00:47:52.760]   because he was like one of the only people that had to do it at the time. And so I grew up with,
[00:47:52.760 --> 00:47:56.680]   you know, when I was five, I got a crystal radio set and he was like, I figured this out. You
[00:47:56.680 --> 00:48:02.040]   better figure it out. And so, and I learned Morris code, you know, when I was like eight or nine
[00:48:02.040 --> 00:48:08.120]   years old. And then, did you really? I'm impressed. Well, my grandfather gave me one of the little,
[00:48:08.120 --> 00:48:15.000]   you know, the little practice things. Yeah, I practiced that. And then, and then my,
[00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:20.760]   there was a, you know, at our church, there was someone from UNICEIS was teaching basic, you know,
[00:48:20.760 --> 00:48:27.000]   on TRS 80s. He donated like 10 TRS 80s and, and a bunch of us sat there and learned how to do
[00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:31.640]   programming. And so, and then, so then, so then, so then, you know, then we were,
[00:48:31.640 --> 00:48:37.000]   now my grandfather had a TRS 80. So I sat there and learned how to do that, learned how to solder
[00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:41.000]   from him. And it was funny because you learn how to solder. And then in the afternoon, we'd go,
[00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:46.600]   I'd go, you know, I'd go up to the shop and we'd learn how to weld. So it was, we did a lot of
[00:48:46.600 --> 00:48:52.360]   both of those things. And yeah, so that was it. And then I, you know, for the most part, it was just,
[00:48:52.360 --> 00:48:56.680]   you know, geeky grandfather and a great geeky uncle was an engineer for med red, which is now
[00:48:56.680 --> 00:49:01.240]   part of bear, I think, but, but the, so he taught me a lot of, you know, building stuff and
[00:49:02.360 --> 00:49:08.440]   fueled my, my interest in a lot of those things. And so, so anyway, so anyway, so my, my parents,
[00:49:08.440 --> 00:49:12.920]   interest in politics kept me reading all those magazines. And then, but I, but a lot of it was
[00:49:12.920 --> 00:49:16.120]   also, I was doing a lot of geeky stuff too. So it was fun. The hard thing about being
[00:49:16.120 --> 00:49:20.680]   apparent is you know that things you were doing are going to imprint on your child for life,
[00:49:20.680 --> 00:49:26.360]   but you just don't know which things. It could be the cigarettes you smoke. It's not, it's not clear,
[00:49:26.360 --> 00:49:32.040]   right? I will, I will admit, I followed my mom's thing with, that with, with some restrictions,
[00:49:32.040 --> 00:49:35.560]   if we ever went into a bookstore and I wanted to buy a book, it didn't matter how expensive it was,
[00:49:35.560 --> 00:49:39.960]   or bigger than she was, she's buy it. Yeah. And, and that's where you got that magazine habit.
[00:49:39.960 --> 00:49:44.680]   You must spend $100. I did. Yeah. I would get lots of magazines. I, you know, and I, I, I,
[00:49:44.680 --> 00:49:49.000]   I put down magazines. I mean, obviously there were certain magazines I didn't even try to
[00:49:49.000 --> 00:49:52.280]   put down in front of my mom, but, but there were a lot of magazines. I would just throw down like,
[00:49:52.280 --> 00:49:56.600]   I wonder if she'll buy me this magazine. Yeah, she did. She buy it. Yeah. And but my mom would buy
[00:49:56.600 --> 00:50:03.240]   you anything. Like, I put, I put a pipe and tobacco down one time when I was like 14 years old.
[00:50:03.240 --> 00:50:08.680]   She bought that too. You know, like, sure, you know, she's like, she's bought a, I was out
[00:50:08.680 --> 00:50:12.680]   on the smoke in this pipe. And one of my cousins was like, what are you doing?
[00:50:12.680 --> 00:50:16.360]   They're like, did your mom know about this? I was like, she paid for it. So, so anyway,
[00:50:16.360 --> 00:50:21.080]   what? And, um, yes, she, she wouldn't, she wouldn't allow us to have anything that was like,
[00:50:21.080 --> 00:50:26.040]   sake, like she didn't want anything to be kind of, uh, uh, I got tired of it really. For a bit.
[00:50:26.040 --> 00:50:30.360]   No, that's, yeah. It was forbidden. You'd want to do it. Yeah. I tried it. I tried it. I never
[00:50:30.360 --> 00:50:34.040]   smoked it. Yeah. I smoked it for like a week and then I was like, Oh, this is horrible. And I
[00:50:34.040 --> 00:50:37.480]   can put it down. Yeah. I didn't have any, uh, your mom was smart. You need to do that again.
[00:50:37.480 --> 00:50:41.720]   Your mom was smart. Yeah. She had a master's in job development. So we were, we were one big,
[00:50:41.720 --> 00:50:47.880]   we were one big lab for her. Like she just, she just was constantly testing things with us.
[00:50:47.880 --> 00:50:52.200]   Nice. Is it true? Is it, is it true that your nickname and growing up was controlled group?
[00:50:52.200 --> 00:50:58.920]   No, Alex, but it was what it was. Time to go back in the Skinner box, Alex.
[00:50:58.920 --> 00:51:05.480]   Exactly. It's so was basic. Your first language to Andy. Yeah. Basic. Yeah. Absolutely.
[00:51:05.480 --> 00:51:11.960]   And then it was, this is why having, having, making sure that the kid has a computer that you,
[00:51:11.960 --> 00:51:17.320]   that he can he or she can actually program is such a big deal because yeah, quickly,
[00:51:17.320 --> 00:51:21.800]   quickly got into basic, then got into assembler language when I couldn't figure out how to do
[00:51:21.800 --> 00:51:27.080]   some things in basic and then came down and I mean, I was joking about, uh, about, uh,
[00:51:27.080 --> 00:51:33.080]   about pirating games, but that was also a wonderful development part of my development because it
[00:51:33.080 --> 00:51:36.840]   was that's, that was, that also drove part of my interest in assembly language because it was
[00:51:36.840 --> 00:51:41.240]   like, okay, so how, how is it actually accessing the disk drive and there was a beautiful,
[00:51:41.240 --> 00:51:45.000]   beautiful book. I used this assembler so you could take out the copy protection, right? You'd have to
[00:51:45.000 --> 00:51:50.440]   figure out which bytes to change. It's like, okay, so what's on, what's on track zero sector zero?
[00:51:50.440 --> 00:51:55.400]   Like what? Let's take a look at that code and then actually like feeling, putting my hand on the,
[00:51:55.400 --> 00:52:00.760]   on the floppy drive so I could feel like what the head was doing. And then I remember, I remember
[00:52:00.760 --> 00:52:06.120]   one of the most proudest moments of my life was when I cracked dazzle draw because they were using
[00:52:06.120 --> 00:52:11.240]   this interest. They were, a lot of games would use like custom track layouts where it wouldn't be
[00:52:11.240 --> 00:52:16.120]   just going, but usual, doc layout. It would be like a custom, you don't go, it wasn't a sequential
[00:52:16.120 --> 00:52:21.480]   thing. They were doing not just spiral tracks, but intersecting spiral tracks. And as soon as I
[00:52:21.480 --> 00:52:26.040]   figured that out, as soon as I finally managed to remove the copy protection on that, by the time
[00:52:26.040 --> 00:52:32.440]   I was like, oh, wow, I need, I can't, I wish I were one of those kids who drank illegally because
[00:52:32.440 --> 00:52:36.840]   I deserve a drink. I deserve a beer after that. See, that's the difference in you and me. You were
[00:52:36.840 --> 00:52:44.280]   doing it as a kid. I was 35. So I could have a drink. When I was young, we, you know, dad can
[00:52:44.280 --> 00:52:49.960]   have a computer. I can't afford a uni vac. Sorry, son. I mean, it wasn't there weren't home computers,
[00:52:49.960 --> 00:52:56.440]   but we did in seventh grade, kind of like Bill Gates is his mom, they had a bake sale and they
[00:52:56.440 --> 00:53:01.400]   raised enough money to get a time sharing terminal at the Lakeside school. The Moses Brown, where I
[00:53:01.400 --> 00:53:07.720]   went in Providence, they had in a closet somewhere when I was in seventh grade, a time sharing terminal
[00:53:07.720 --> 00:53:13.960]   to some, you know, computer, probably a brown, but I was not at all. It was like, I don't, that's
[00:53:13.960 --> 00:53:18.520]   boring. I don't want to do that. Renee, what was your first, how did you get into technology?
[00:53:18.520 --> 00:53:24.920]   My father was an early IBM engineer. He was installing train and airplane airport computers
[00:53:24.920 --> 00:53:29.880]   around the world. And when we moved to Canada, he decided he didn't want to have to drive to IBM
[00:53:29.880 --> 00:53:35.240]   downtown every day just to use spreadsheets. So he got an Apple two plus for us moved to Canada
[00:53:35.240 --> 00:53:40.680]   from South Africa, South Africa. Yeah, from Sirefrica Leo Beckwin, it's still working on the
[00:53:40.680 --> 00:53:46.520]   Rifikia IBM Sirefrica. I wish you would do the whole show like that. Can you please? Yeah. Yeah. So
[00:53:46.520 --> 00:53:49.960]   then he put that in the basement whenever he was at work, I would go down and I would, I started off
[00:53:49.960 --> 00:53:55.560]   like by playing beer run and Wolfenstein and all of a sudden, I learned, and I learned how to
[00:53:55.560 --> 00:54:00.440]   program and I could make like a starship fly across the screen and fire phasers. Was that basic?
[00:54:00.440 --> 00:54:05.480]   Was that your first language? Yeah. Like one centimeter by one centimeter low-res pixels and
[00:54:05.480 --> 00:54:09.960]   then you have to go for the high-res pixels later on. That's why we have a generation of insecure
[00:54:09.960 --> 00:54:17.480]   software because this entire generation learned to program basic. I need a go-to statement here,
[00:54:17.480 --> 00:54:24.600]   please. I think it's because like the next generation after us, like everything started getting so
[00:54:24.600 --> 00:54:29.400]   locked down that you were now writing software using libraries that you have no idea actually
[00:54:29.400 --> 00:54:35.400]   how they work or what they do. I mean, you can't, without any control over it, it's like
[00:54:35.400 --> 00:54:40.040]   there are things that are like, they're so complicated, you can't figure out that what I've
[00:54:40.040 --> 00:54:44.360]   just done that I thought was a clever solution to a problem actually is going to bring down the
[00:54:44.360 --> 00:54:48.680]   downfall of all humanity as soon as this connects to any other instance of this app.
[00:54:49.800 --> 00:54:54.840]   Meanwhile, once punched out the original basic in paper from scraps in a cave.
[00:54:54.840 --> 00:55:02.600]   Like a real programmer. Yeah. I like the, I really enjoy those good old days.
[00:55:02.600 --> 00:55:10.840]   I'm sorry just quickly. I've been looking at a lot of videos of people who are into
[00:55:10.840 --> 00:55:18.360]   like a vintage computing and there are multiple projects to design brand new computers that are
[00:55:18.360 --> 00:55:24.840]   6502 based, like based on the same processor that are built with parts you can get anywhere where
[00:55:24.840 --> 00:55:29.960]   everything is open source essentially to build a modern version of like the Commodore 64.
[00:55:29.960 --> 00:55:35.720]   And I'm, that's not my jam. The, my, when I want to get back in touch with my, hey, I want to own
[00:55:35.720 --> 00:55:39.160]   everything, I want to understand everything, I want to be able to modify everything. That's when I
[00:55:39.160 --> 00:55:45.080]   go to my Raspberry Pi, but I love the fact that there are like people my age and younger and older
[00:55:45.080 --> 00:55:49.320]   that are like, well, what if we, what if we like, some of us are electrical engineers,
[00:55:49.320 --> 00:55:54.280]   some of us are system engineers, some of us can write a brand new kernel, some of them. And now
[00:55:54.280 --> 00:56:00.040]   it's possible to send out and have boards made will get, will get an FPGA and program that to
[00:56:00.040 --> 00:56:06.120]   simulate a video chip that we don't have anymore. It's, it, I love that just like their, their
[00:56:06.120 --> 00:56:11.640]   car nuts who are like, I don't, it's not like I want to live in the 1960s and 1970s. It's just that
[00:56:11.640 --> 00:56:16.760]   I enjoy a car where I know everything that works. I know how to improve everything. And at no point,
[00:56:16.760 --> 00:56:21.880]   there's a black box where I need to have something recoded. And it tickles me that there's also that,
[00:56:21.880 --> 00:56:26.440]   that sort of thing going on in computing as well. That's Steve Gibson. He wanted, he did for a long
[00:56:26.440 --> 00:56:31.880]   time say, when I retire, I'm going to rewrite the PDPA operating system in a separate way.
[00:56:31.880 --> 00:56:35.880]   He has, by the way, I asked him a couple of weeks ago, he said, yeah, I don't think I'm going to do
[00:56:35.880 --> 00:56:41.080]   that after all. He fat. You know what? He got a girlfriend. That's what changed at all. Oh,
[00:56:41.080 --> 00:56:47.640]   as always. Yeah, exactly. And his girlfriend said, Hey, I'm an engineer too. I know how to,
[00:56:47.640 --> 00:56:52.600]   how to change the memory stack so we no longer need that separate processor. Oh,
[00:56:52.600 --> 00:56:56.120]   amazing things is when you interviewed a bunch of the early iOS developers and they were from
[00:56:56.120 --> 00:57:00.600]   Europe, the way we used to get programs in magazines, they got them over the radio and they would
[00:57:00.600 --> 00:57:04.760]   just record them to a cassette and then take them over to their Commodore 64 and play them
[00:57:04.760 --> 00:57:09.480]   right off the radio. And that's because my mind up when you listen to music in Europe, it could be
[00:57:09.480 --> 00:57:14.200]   poo poo poo. That's amazing. How
[00:57:14.200 --> 00:57:18.520]   why would a radio station play play the beeps and boops? That's very strange.
[00:57:18.520 --> 00:57:22.120]   For geeky little one way to distribute it. One day change the world. Yeah. Yeah.
[00:57:22.120 --> 00:57:26.360]   That's the best sure beats typing it in, which I think all four of us have done. Yes. Yes.
[00:57:26.360 --> 00:57:31.960]   Yes. Well, you could type it in back then, Leo. You can't type in four. Oh, you couldn't do it now.
[00:57:31.960 --> 00:57:37.560]   Let's take a little break. We'll come back more. We actually have some Apple news. I'm just
[00:57:38.760 --> 00:57:43.320]   as you can tell. I'm stretching it out. I'm letting them know.
[00:57:43.320 --> 00:57:46.600]   The nine course meal. We're doing a little bit still a little bit.
[00:57:46.600 --> 00:57:53.880]   Exactly. It's the chef's menu. Leo could Leo fresh things out of the kitchen based on his own taste
[00:57:53.880 --> 00:57:57.640]   and base his own. How does he season? He wants the meal to go? Whatever's seasonal. Yes.
[00:57:57.640 --> 00:58:01.320]   Our show neighbor, I want to, you know, I for years, I've worn
[00:58:01.320 --> 00:58:07.400]   in-ear monitors that are custom molded. I mean, I got that habit when I we were doing tech TV and
[00:58:07.400 --> 00:58:12.520]   they an audiologist came in and everybody they poor silicone in your ear. You'd have to hold
[00:58:12.520 --> 00:58:18.440]   your head like this and they put a string in it and you hold your all in so that you would just
[00:58:18.440 --> 00:58:23.640]   get a perfect impression of your ear. Then they pull it out, which was quite a, quite a sound.
[00:58:23.640 --> 00:58:28.920]   And then they then they would send it off to the ultimate ears factory where they would mold.
[00:58:28.920 --> 00:58:36.680]   And I still have my molded UE. I love my UEs, but that's a very expensive, complicated process or
[00:58:36.680 --> 00:58:41.960]   sponsor. Ultimate ears has a new way of doing it that is awesome. And in fact,
[00:58:41.960 --> 00:58:50.120]   it is now my go to set of earbuds. The ultimate ear fits. Wouldn't it be nice? Here's the,
[00:58:50.120 --> 00:58:55.800]   here's it comes in the box like this. Wouldn't it be nice if your earbuds fit like custom
[00:58:55.800 --> 00:59:01.800]   molded earbuds? Well, that's exactly what these are. When you open the box, they're sealed so that
[00:59:01.800 --> 00:59:07.560]   no, they have no exposure to air. There's the kind of the generic ultimate ears. There's the charging
[00:59:07.560 --> 00:59:13.800]   case, which by the way is like a smooth river stone. I just love the charging case. So you get the app,
[00:59:13.800 --> 00:59:20.760]   you get the ultimate ears and then you put them in your ear and they start to warm up. They don't
[00:59:20.760 --> 00:59:27.400]   get hot, but you can see them blinking like that. They warm up and in 60 seconds, they mold themselves
[00:59:27.400 --> 00:59:33.560]   to your ear. It's a company. They're soft silicone. They're actually more, I think more comfortable
[00:59:33.560 --> 00:59:39.240]   than my hard plastic ultimate ears because they fit perfectly. The sound is better. You know,
[00:59:39.240 --> 00:59:44.520]   the better the fit, the better the bass and all that perfect fit. They stay put. You could shake
[00:59:44.520 --> 00:59:49.400]   your head like crazy, but they're ultra comfortable. I wear them. For instance, we had a long plane
[00:59:49.400 --> 00:59:53.720]   flight, warm the whole way. You don't, you don't even notice you can use them. By the way,
[00:59:53.720 --> 00:59:59.000]   they have a microphone in them. So you can use them to answer calls as well as listen to music.
[00:59:59.000 --> 01:00:06.200]   They work great with the iPhone. They work great with any device using Bluetooth and this
[01:00:06.200 --> 01:00:12.440]   groundbreaking light form technology means they fit and they're comfortable. And here's the third
[01:00:12.440 --> 01:00:18.280]   reason you want to do this. No one else can wear them. They're just for you. They're just for you.
[01:00:18.280 --> 01:00:23.480]   Put them in, connect to the app, watch the purple LEDs form the earbuds to your unique shape.
[01:00:23.960 --> 01:00:28.040]   Eight hours of continuous playback and a single charge easily got coast to coast with that
[01:00:28.040 --> 01:00:32.200]   a problem up to 20 hours with the charging case. So you just put them in the case,
[01:00:32.200 --> 01:00:38.040]   charge them back up. They're perfect for listening to your podcasts like this one or your favorite
[01:00:38.040 --> 01:00:44.040]   music to make your conference calls. Ultimate ears has been doing this for a very long time.
[01:00:44.040 --> 01:00:50.280]   In fact, chances are when you see a pro musician, you wear in earbuds, they're wearing ultimate ears.
[01:00:50.280 --> 01:00:57.000]   They've been doing it over 25 years and they make sure and this is every year but as a different
[01:00:57.000 --> 01:01:02.520]   feeling and different sound. So you should try these but they make sure to give you a full warm
[01:01:02.520 --> 01:01:07.880]   sound. They've got a nice punchy low end and because the seal is good, the low end is superb.
[01:01:07.880 --> 01:01:13.640]   And of course you can EQ it in the app. Play and pause music, answer calls. They've got built-in
[01:01:13.640 --> 01:01:18.040]   controls. Just tap the ears. You can use the free app to set custom actions. So you can have
[01:01:18.920 --> 01:01:23.880]   your personal voice assistant, whichever one you like activate. You could adjust the volume,
[01:01:23.880 --> 01:01:28.040]   next track, all of that stuff. And here's an important thing because I think some people
[01:01:28.040 --> 01:01:34.360]   can say, "Well yeah, but if now it's molded in my ear, can I return them?" Yes. 30-day money back
[01:01:34.360 --> 01:01:40.360]   guarantee. So there's absolutely no risk. Plus you get free shipping, free returns, a one-year warranty.
[01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:50.360]   Visit ue.com/fits and I want you to use the promo code MAC break just to let them know you saw it here.
[01:01:50.360 --> 01:01:56.440]   Ultimate Ears says it's a right ear but so you want the fits. Ue...well actually they're all good but
[01:01:56.440 --> 01:02:05.240]   I've been wearing Ultimate Ears for decades but ue.com/fits promo code is MAC break.
[01:02:05.960 --> 01:02:11.480]   Ue.com/fits thank you Ultimate Ears for making these available to everybody. Everybody deserves
[01:02:11.480 --> 01:02:17.640]   cult custom molded ear pieces. It's the only way to travel. Ue.com/FITS.
[01:02:17.640 --> 01:02:24.280]   It's mine. You can't use them because they're molded. I paid for them like I bought them and I'm
[01:02:24.280 --> 01:02:28.920]   super happy with them. I use them all the time. You got black. I didn't know that they had black.
[01:02:28.920 --> 01:02:35.800]   I got white so that's nice. I got black ones. Yeah. Yeah. I a couple of us bottom on office hours
[01:02:35.800 --> 01:02:43.240]   and we did a little unboxing put them in there. Oh fun. It warms up. It's a little...I mean they're
[01:02:43.240 --> 01:02:48.120]   warm but it's not hot. I'm not that comfortable. No, it's just warm. And it's absolutely correct.
[01:02:48.120 --> 01:02:53.400]   Once you have it fit it is. It just feels like it's part of your ear at that point when you push it
[01:02:53.400 --> 01:02:57.640]   in but it is much more comfortable than the other fitted ones I've had in the past. Oh my gosh.
[01:02:57.640 --> 01:03:04.360]   These are...when I first got these years ago I said these are hard plastic. They're not soft rubber.
[01:03:04.360 --> 01:03:08.760]   No, they're hard. So you kind of get used to going...
[01:03:08.760 --> 01:03:15.000]   What's you get used to? It's okay but it is not as comfortable as the... Yeah, these are really good.
[01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:19.800]   Thank you for that unsolicited plug Alex Lindsay.
[01:03:19.800 --> 01:03:25.240]   Okay Mr. Debunker Renee Richie time to debunk another one.
[01:03:25.240 --> 01:03:31.400]   All right let's go. Rumors. Apple forced to cut iPhone 14 orders by 10%
[01:03:32.680 --> 01:03:37.560]   despite anticipating strong demand. This is a digit times piece. They're right there at the...
[01:03:37.560 --> 01:03:44.920]   At the randomly accurate. Randomly accurate. At the tip of the funnel for the hardware.
[01:03:44.920 --> 01:03:52.520]   TSMC is apparently having some difficulty with the three nanometer process. We kind of
[01:03:52.520 --> 01:03:58.120]   figured that since the iPhone...we think the rumor is iPhone 14 only the pro versions will have
[01:03:58.120 --> 01:04:04.280]   the new chip. Is that right? Yeah. That's the current rumor. It's understood according to
[01:04:04.280 --> 01:04:08.520]   digit times this is the quote that the mass production of Apple's iPhone 14 series has started.
[01:04:08.520 --> 01:04:14.920]   I guess it would right by now. But the target shipment of the first wave of 90 million units
[01:04:14.920 --> 01:04:18.440]   has been reduced by 10%. Ming Chi Kuo said...
[01:04:18.440 --> 01:04:21.960]   You like demand for the iPhone 14 in China will be stronger than the iPhone 13.
[01:04:21.960 --> 01:04:26.440]   The scalpers are putting down deposits Leo. Can you believe that? The scalpers putting down
[01:04:26.440 --> 01:04:30.520]   deposits. That's what he said. That's what he said. Wow. Okay.
[01:04:30.520 --> 01:04:38.440]   What makes one iPhone more popular than its predecessor? Is it a better camera?
[01:04:38.440 --> 01:04:44.520]   It depends. Sometimes there's a super cycle like iPhone 6 was the first big and bigger iPhone.
[01:04:44.520 --> 01:04:48.200]   And what that does is it doesn't necessarily get you more customers but it brings people who
[01:04:48.200 --> 01:04:53.320]   might not have upgraded till the next year or the year after forward. Which is why iPhone 6s didn't
[01:04:53.320 --> 01:04:56.920]   do as well because everybody was going to buy a new iPhone, bought a new iPhone 6.
[01:04:56.920 --> 01:05:01.480]   So like a lot of stuff moves like depends on the features. It depends when contracts roll over
[01:05:01.480 --> 01:05:06.360]   how long people have had it. So they tend to go up and down how big the change is, how consumer
[01:05:06.360 --> 01:05:10.520]   friendly the change is. People like long battery life. They like better cameras. They don't care
[01:05:10.520 --> 01:05:16.680]   about a lot of the nerdy stuff that we spend most of our time debating endlessly. Like refresh rates
[01:05:16.680 --> 01:05:22.760]   and things like that. Guo Ming Chi as you say it does say he thinks that that digit times report is
[01:05:22.760 --> 01:05:27.800]   false. He disagrees. Yeah there are doing a lot. It's interesting. Like Tim Cook has said before
[01:05:27.800 --> 01:05:31.240]   that it's hard. Like he wouldn't he wouldn't recommend that people put too much faith in any one
[01:05:31.240 --> 01:05:35.560]   single data point because Apple deals with a multitude of suppliers across a multitude of
[01:05:35.560 --> 01:05:39.960]   different plans. It does seem like it's harder this year. Like the interesting thing about the
[01:05:39.960 --> 01:05:45.720]   chipset basically last year there were two chips. There was the A15 that went into the iPhone 13
[01:05:45.720 --> 01:05:52.040]   and the A15 Pro that went into the iPhone 13 Pro. And that was the one with the extra GPU core.
[01:05:52.040 --> 01:05:55.560]   It was a little bit different. It did the ProRes and CoD code. So it was a different chip. Apple
[01:05:55.560 --> 01:05:59.640]   just called them by the same name. And so this year it sounds like they're going to put that chip,
[01:05:59.640 --> 01:06:04.600]   the A15 plus chip or Pro chip into the regular iPhone. So it's going to get a really good boost.
[01:06:04.600 --> 01:06:07.880]   It's going to get a whole extra GPU core. It's going to get those ProRes engines. It's going to
[01:06:07.880 --> 01:06:12.760]   have better performance. It's still five nanometers though right? TSMC's have trouble with three
[01:06:12.760 --> 01:06:18.120]   second generation. Okay. There's also an N4. So like which is really just a third version. Like
[01:06:18.120 --> 01:06:22.200]   they're just marketing names. They don't actually mean they haven't actually meant the size in a
[01:06:22.200 --> 01:06:27.800]   very long time. And different companies like Samsung's 5 nanometer process is completely different
[01:06:27.800 --> 01:06:31.960]   than TSMC's including the size of the die. So like they don't really mean anything. It's just
[01:06:31.960 --> 01:06:36.040]   like the generation of the process. So right now they're on N4 which is supposed to be the third
[01:06:36.040 --> 01:06:41.000]   generation of N5 and trying to get to N3 which isn't really 3 nanometers but it is a process
[01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:46.200]   strength that should give them like 20%. The whole thing is so complicated Leo. But the bottom line
[01:06:46.200 --> 01:06:51.320]   is that they need a process to be mature enough and they yield high enough to be able to produce
[01:06:51.320 --> 01:06:56.360]   at Apple volume which is the highest volume in the world. They make 90 million in anything else.
[01:06:56.360 --> 01:07:01.720]   Jeez Louise. That's why they get it first because nobody else can prepay for 90 million
[01:07:01.720 --> 01:07:08.920]   phones plus the max plus the iPads. It's ridiculous ridiculous numbers and TSMC is finally feeling a
[01:07:08.920 --> 01:07:12.600]   little bit of pain. There were other reports today that some of the chemicals that they use of
[01:07:12.600 --> 01:07:19.160]   doubled in price and Apple is very low to raise the entry level prices of a high-end iPhone.
[01:07:19.160 --> 01:07:22.920]   So is TSMC going to eat that? Is Apple going to eat that? Are they going to pass it along?
[01:07:22.920 --> 01:07:29.640]   And I'm knowing Tim Cook, I bet you Apple's contract has a specific price in it and delivery
[01:07:29.640 --> 01:07:35.240]   and it's done. I'm sure it's been done for months if not years. So you're right TSMC gets to you.
[01:07:35.240 --> 01:07:38.440]   You can't get components from the other companies. Yeah it's hard.
[01:07:40.440 --> 01:07:47.400]   There was another battle, rumor battle going on this week over the 5G modem chip. Initial
[01:07:47.400 --> 01:07:52.520]   reports said Apple was having technical issues and had to put the Qualcomm chip,
[01:07:52.520 --> 01:07:57.800]   continue to put the Qualcomm chip in their phones. Later reports have said no no it's not
[01:07:57.800 --> 01:08:04.600]   technical it's legal. What do you think? Yeah I mean it's so confusing because Qualcomm,
[01:08:04.600 --> 01:08:08.040]   I don't think the decision should have gone the way that they did. Qualcomm
[01:08:08.600 --> 01:08:14.200]   contributes all these technologies towards the standard and in return for having their technologies
[01:08:14.200 --> 01:08:17.800]   used and not somebody else's they're supposed to make those technologies are available
[01:08:17.800 --> 01:08:23.320]   freely available at reasonable and non-discriminatory pricing. And Qualcomm is known to,
[01:08:23.320 --> 01:08:28.520]   yeah a friend and Qualcomm is known to request a percentage of the retail price of a device which
[01:08:28.520 --> 01:08:33.080]   if any other component maker did that there would not be enough room for like there would just not
[01:08:33.080 --> 01:08:38.520]   be a product like if the camera, if Qualcomm says we want 10% and Sony says we want 10% for the camera
[01:08:38.520 --> 01:08:42.280]   somebody else says we want 10% for the memory module there's just not enough percentage
[01:08:42.280 --> 01:08:46.840]   but Qualcomm has won every one of these decisions up to the Supreme Court so they have all the
[01:08:46.840 --> 01:08:51.160]   leverage in the world. Qualcomm is also a huge patent company they're not just a chip set company
[01:08:51.160 --> 01:08:56.120]   they make a ton of money off their patents and Apple has licensed those patents so basically
[01:08:56.120 --> 01:09:00.680]   they can produce stuff their own stuff using Qualcomm's technologies but that
[01:09:00.680 --> 01:09:04.600]   licenses for a limited amount of time and if they're having trouble renewing it or they're
[01:09:04.600 --> 01:09:08.440]   arguing over the pricing of it that could put a serious dent in Apple's ability to put a 5G
[01:09:08.440 --> 01:09:14.200]   chips that into the wild. 9-5 Mac had a soap opera like Guide to these troubles.
[01:09:14.200 --> 01:09:19.800]   The relationship between Apple and Qualcomm has been a fraught one. In particular the
[01:09:19.800 --> 01:09:23.800]   iPhone maker was upset that Qualcomm was double dipping by selling the company a chip and then
[01:09:23.800 --> 01:09:29.400]   demanding a patent royalty fee for use of the chip things got messy at Qualcomm accused Apple of
[01:09:29.400 --> 01:09:35.880]   blackmail. The CEO of the two companies had hostile meetings. Qualcomm refused to sell chips to Apple
[01:09:35.880 --> 01:09:41.480]   for the iPhone XS and XR. Both companies set aside earlier talk of sentiment pledged to fight
[01:09:41.480 --> 01:09:46.040]   it all the way a multi-billion trial multi-billion dollar trial began.
[01:09:46.040 --> 01:09:53.480]   What's the bottom line on this long drama?
[01:09:54.600 --> 01:10:05.960]   They're not. I have to admit that I don't understand how you can sell someone a chip and then license
[01:10:05.960 --> 01:10:10.920]   the use of the chip either. It should be in the price evidently the courts seem to be
[01:10:10.920 --> 01:10:17.640]   to think that it's there. It's gone through enough court tests that I have a tendency to think that
[01:10:17.640 --> 01:10:21.240]   it's tested at this point. It's going to be hard for Apple to probably get around.
[01:10:21.240 --> 01:10:26.120]   The patent kings, Pat and Lee Apple and Fospatence, say that the issue is that
[01:10:26.120 --> 01:10:32.200]   Apple could not use its own 5G chips because that would infringe to Qualcomm patents.
[01:10:32.200 --> 01:10:42.040]   Fospatence has a really good piece on this and basically underscoring that the Supreme
[01:10:42.040 --> 01:10:45.640]   Court doesn't want anything to do with this case. The Department of Justice wants nothing to do with
[01:10:45.640 --> 01:10:50.360]   this case. That really put the writing on the wall that any challenge that Apple wanted to have
[01:10:50.360 --> 01:10:56.840]   to simply say, any decision that they would make to create their own 5G chip would almost certainly
[01:10:56.840 --> 01:11:01.400]   invalidate the two patents that are in question. There's almost no way around it and almost no way
[01:11:01.400 --> 01:11:07.720]   that they could possibly appeal a decision. Although the Fospatence article and going into
[01:11:07.720 --> 01:11:13.080]   better detail than I could possibly summarize is saying that part of it is that Apple might have
[01:11:13.080 --> 01:11:19.400]   had the bad strategy going in on how they were going to start to pursue Qualcomm against this.
[01:11:19.400 --> 01:11:23.720]   And that it wasn't so much that the courts were saying that Apple, you're absolutely wrong,
[01:11:23.720 --> 01:11:27.320]   you're stupid, you're trying to get away with something, we won't have it, go back to your
[01:11:27.320 --> 01:11:32.120]   Heidi hole and be with your tail between your legs and be punished for all these horrible things
[01:11:32.120 --> 01:11:37.800]   you're doing. It's more like, yeah, we're not here to hear that kind of argument, so goodbye.
[01:11:37.800 --> 01:11:43.160]   Solve it yourself. Yeah, it was basically you basically there's nothing for us to decide here,
[01:11:43.160 --> 01:11:49.320]   go back home. And now it's very, very clear. Which is a victory for Qualcomm, right? Absolutely.
[01:11:50.200 --> 01:11:59.000]   Because again, especially in this environment, when the DOJ doesn't want to hear it, that's like,
[01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:04.600]   okay, we're not we're we're not going to no matter what happens in the Senate, no matter what happens
[01:12:04.600 --> 01:12:09.640]   in the in the Oval Office, nothing's going to change to help us here. We just better keep
[01:12:09.640 --> 01:12:15.880]   budgeting for payments to Qualcomm. And the down the quote downside of this is that you continue to
[01:12:15.880 --> 01:12:21.160]   get absolutely the best modem chip that you can buy in the entire world for compatibility with 5G.
[01:12:21.160 --> 01:12:26.440]   So okay, is that true? In other words, I mean, Ming Chi Quo I think got it wrong when he said
[01:12:26.440 --> 01:12:31.400]   Apple is having technical issues with 5G. It wasn't. Yeah, no, their chips are great.
[01:12:31.400 --> 01:12:35.000]   Samsung media tech, a lot of people make these chips, they just need this.
[01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:39.640]   They're just like, because frankly, like, yeah, like the LTE chips weren't as good because they
[01:12:39.640 --> 01:12:44.280]   didn't have Qualcomm involved. It's just it's it's so strange that like this, like these governments
[01:12:44.280 --> 01:12:47.880]   all around the world cares so desperately about competition, except when it comes to one of the
[01:12:47.880 --> 01:12:53.080]   most important core technologies that exists in the world today. Yeah, so what is the future
[01:12:53.080 --> 01:12:57.480]   hold? Apple's agreement with Qualcomm ends in a couple of years, but that doesn't mean they can
[01:12:57.480 --> 01:13:02.680]   use the technology. They got a license at Apple. They better invent 6G fast. Yeah, there you go.
[01:13:02.680 --> 01:13:07.880]   It's kind of a race between licensing agreements, expiring and the patents expiring.
[01:13:07.880 --> 01:13:14.920]   And so for the foreseeable future, it's just simpler just to simply keep keep these. Sometimes
[01:13:14.920 --> 01:13:19.480]   you just you know that organized crime is get trying to get away with something. But if you want
[01:13:19.480 --> 01:13:24.360]   cement for this building, you may as well just you may as well not fight that fight and just pay
[01:13:24.360 --> 01:13:29.000]   20% extra to buy cement for your building from this one location. And that's pretty much what Apple
[01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:34.840]   has. I do recommend a Florian Mueller's article in the Fospaths because there is a lot of you know,
[01:13:34.840 --> 01:13:42.440]   a lot of legal back and forth on this. Yeah. And it's he says at least with the benefit of 2020
[01:13:42.440 --> 01:13:50.120]   hindsight, it's clear that what is a bad idea for Apple to pursue those P tab IPRs post settlement.
[01:13:50.120 --> 01:13:56.440]   But on the other hand, Apple's strategy says wasn't a bad strategy. It just turns out it didn't
[01:13:56.440 --> 01:14:02.120]   didn't work out in the end. In the end, what might have played a role here, he says, is that
[01:14:02.120 --> 01:14:07.320]   Apple versus Qualcomm was simply as Qualcomm set a poor vehicle for asking the Supreme Court to
[01:14:07.320 --> 01:14:13.240]   address how to apply metamune to portfolio licenses as a previous case. This here had a lot to do with
[01:14:13.240 --> 01:14:18.280]   legal technicalities and psychologically, Apple's primary problem may have been
[01:14:18.280 --> 01:14:22.520]   at the federal court, the DOJ and also printed the Supreme Court just couldn't see a pressing
[01:14:22.520 --> 01:14:25.880]   and legitimate reason for which Apple kept challenging these patents.
[01:14:25.880 --> 01:14:29.960]   And I think that that's that Apple's going to have this problem. Some of the other companies
[01:14:29.960 --> 01:14:34.920]   are going to have a problem with a more conservative set of courts are going to be less
[01:14:34.920 --> 01:14:40.040]   they're going to jump into this a lot less if they don't have to. And a lot of
[01:14:40.040 --> 01:14:44.760]   they're running through a pattern now all the way to the top of the court where they just don't
[01:14:44.760 --> 01:14:50.040]   want to interact if they don't have to. The court is trying to stay out of things more than get
[01:14:50.040 --> 01:14:53.880]   into them. And so I think that that's going to be more of a challenge. Also, I don't think the
[01:14:53.880 --> 01:14:57.320]   government's there to help them because the government just had its wings clipped last week.
[01:14:58.280 --> 01:15:01.080]   So I don't think the government's there to help anybody now because they can't
[01:15:01.080 --> 01:15:05.640]   they are probably. It's a pick their battles. Well, if I was if I was in the FCC, I'd be pretty
[01:15:05.640 --> 01:15:09.560]   frustrated and say, I'm not going to help any here because they're they've just been
[01:15:09.560 --> 01:15:14.760]   they've had all their nails cut off. So they're you know, so they're with the EPA the EPA ruling
[01:15:14.760 --> 01:15:18.680]   is going to affect the FCC. So this just to be clear, this is the Supreme Court ruling that said
[01:15:18.680 --> 01:15:23.400]   that the that these federal agencies the EPA in this case, but FCC is one of them
[01:15:23.400 --> 01:15:28.440]   are cannot make regulations. That's the extra legislative that it has to be the Congress
[01:15:28.440 --> 01:15:33.320]   that has to make these regulations. In the case of the EPA, it was pollution standards for
[01:15:33.320 --> 01:15:38.200]   states. But in the case of the FCC, what is it? It just means that it's going to be much harder
[01:15:38.200 --> 01:15:43.240]   for the FCC to just make up rules like they basically this is yeah, you have to go to Congress and
[01:15:43.240 --> 01:15:47.640]   get that Congress is so gridlocked. Well, that means nothing. It's going to happen.
[01:15:47.640 --> 01:15:50.840]   Well, yeah, is the one I say about that is that there are things that go through that are
[01:15:50.840 --> 01:15:54.280]   bipartisan, it's just that you can't do all of what everybody wants. I mean, there's things that
[01:15:54.280 --> 01:15:58.200]   everyone agrees on and it just pops right through. So yeah, you have to go down the middle because
[01:15:58.200 --> 01:16:02.040]   we don't hear about those much, do we? No, because because no one makes it because it doesn't get a
[01:16:02.040 --> 01:16:05.400]   lot of press, but there have been definitely things that have gotten votes from both sides.
[01:16:05.400 --> 01:16:09.800]   It's not like it's gridlocked. It's gridlocked. The problem is, is both sides are so radical at
[01:16:09.800 --> 01:16:14.280]   this point that they they if they don't get everything that they wanted, then Congress is gridlocked.
[01:16:14.280 --> 01:16:19.400]   But but if you if they both compromise, it goes right through. You know, so that's the that's the
[01:16:19.400 --> 01:16:24.520]   thing. Yeah, but with the with the FTC earlier this year, they were maybe late last year,
[01:16:24.520 --> 01:16:31.080]   they made an an unusual, an un unbidden assertion that, hey, by the way, tech companies, if you think
[01:16:31.080 --> 01:16:35.400]   that you're going to be going just fine until Congress starts legislating you, realize that part
[01:16:35.400 --> 01:16:40.920]   of our hunting license as approved by Congress is to go after deceptive and unfair practice practices.
[01:16:40.920 --> 01:16:44.600]   And if we decide that you're telling people that you're maintaining privacy and yet you're selling
[01:16:44.600 --> 01:16:49.160]   their data on the open web, that is deceptive, that is unfair, and we don't have to have an
[01:16:49.160 --> 01:16:54.520]   act of Congress in order to try to get you to knock that stuff off. But as you've been saying,
[01:16:54.520 --> 01:16:58.440]   the fact that this is now when you go all if you manage to get all the way to Supreme Court,
[01:16:58.440 --> 01:17:05.000]   the idea the the now the the the the the gravity well is that the gravity is going to float towards
[01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:09.400]   well, no, an agency does not have the right to do something that Congress has not specifically
[01:17:09.400 --> 01:17:15.160]   told them to do. So that's strike one strike to as great as it has been for the past year to hear
[01:17:15.800 --> 01:17:22.840]   so many Democratic and Republican representatives talking about wanting to reel in reel in a big
[01:17:22.840 --> 01:17:27.480]   tech reel in other big companies break up large monopolies. We have seen that when the rubber
[01:17:27.480 --> 01:17:32.200]   meets the road, there hasn't been a lot of, oh, well, that's the we don't want to spend the
[01:17:32.200 --> 01:17:36.680]   political capital on that. This is a midterm year or we're not sure that we can actually get this
[01:17:36.680 --> 01:17:39.800]   through. We're not sure we can get a majority to get that through. We don't want to do the work
[01:17:39.800 --> 01:17:44.040]   to make that happen. And without a mandate from the Oval Office that this is really a priority for
[01:17:44.040 --> 01:17:49.720]   my administration, it's probably going to be worth the risk of just continuing to operate the way
[01:17:49.720 --> 01:17:53.480]   you've been operating and hope things work out. Okay. Well, I mean, shaking the tree does have
[01:17:53.480 --> 01:17:57.560]   fruit come out of it. Like, you know, I think that they, you know, they there's a lot of those
[01:17:57.560 --> 01:18:02.200]   the the tech industry was put on on, you know, not I'm sorry, I'm a little jaded because I used to
[01:18:02.200 --> 01:18:08.120]   I've worked in this industry for a long time. And so the the the tech industry was warned like,
[01:18:08.120 --> 01:18:12.680]   hey, you're not paying enough attention. It's like, you know, and so suddenly a whole bunch of people
[01:18:12.680 --> 01:18:17.240]   started spending a lot of money in Washington, DC and giving money to campaigns and you're taking
[01:18:17.240 --> 01:18:21.080]   people out and everything else, all the things that telecommunications companies, organizations
[01:18:21.080 --> 01:18:26.200]   have gotten really good at. Well, and it's not just the US because the EU just passed
[01:18:26.200 --> 01:18:33.480]   yesterday, actually today, the Additional Markets Act and the Digital Services Act, which are
[01:18:33.480 --> 01:18:40.680]   significant restrictions on what big tech can do. I don't know how it's going to impact Apple,
[01:18:41.320 --> 01:18:49.160]   but I have to say Google Apple, Microsoft, Facebook, Amazon, they're all going to definitely have an
[01:18:49.160 --> 01:18:55.800]   impact here. And the fines are huge. DMA violations are 10% of annual global revenue
[01:18:55.800 --> 01:19:03.000]   up to DSA breaches up to 6% of annual global. It's weird they can make it annual when it's
[01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:06.760]   any you thing. The whole there's a whole bunch of really weird aspects. You're global. It's global.
[01:19:06.760 --> 01:19:10.040]   Yeah, including a lack of American response, which I find interesting.
[01:19:10.040 --> 01:19:16.360]   Yeah, the, you know, we'll probably talk more about this tomorrow on Twig. And maybe we can
[01:19:16.360 --> 01:19:22.040]   get a lawyer on because it's complicated. The Digital Services Act bans targeted advertising aimed
[01:19:22.040 --> 01:19:26.840]   at children are based on sensitive data such as religion, gender, race, and political opinions.
[01:19:26.840 --> 01:19:31.800]   It also bans dark patterns. You know, that seems like that's okay. There's a lot of good stuff in
[01:19:31.800 --> 01:19:36.920]   it. It's just like it's global like the fines are global instead of EU, which is weird. And also,
[01:19:36.920 --> 01:19:40.600]   it's like on the face of targets American companies because those are the big tech companies.
[01:19:40.600 --> 01:19:44.920]   Then you think America would have some sort of, you know, messaging around that.
[01:19:44.920 --> 01:19:52.840]   They also updated their message, so TLDR, they wanted to have all messaging services be interoperable,
[01:19:52.840 --> 01:19:56.440]   even if it meant they could be no longer encrypted. Great for them, right? Because they
[01:19:56.440 --> 01:20:00.680]   haven't liked encryption in a long time. And they updated it today to say, well, it's not just any
[01:20:00.680 --> 01:20:04.280]   app that wants it, but we still want a bunch of features to actually work together. And there
[01:20:04.280 --> 01:20:08.040]   may be seeing how that'll be implemented in the real world. That's the Digital Markets Act,
[01:20:08.040 --> 01:20:13.640]   which is probably the one that most impact Apple requires, as you said, message services to be
[01:20:13.640 --> 01:20:19.240]   interoperable. So Apple's messages would somehow have to be interoperable with WhatsApp, provide
[01:20:19.240 --> 01:20:23.880]   business users access to their data, business users. No longer Andy Chat. Like if Andy said,
[01:20:23.880 --> 01:20:26.920]   I want to have Andy Chat work with everything, they wouldn't have to go and support that.
[01:20:26.920 --> 01:20:31.160]   God, okay, got it. Okay. This is the other one that's going to be really have to do with the
[01:20:31.160 --> 01:20:36.520]   app store. Companies will not be allowed to favor their own services of arrivals or prevent users
[01:20:36.520 --> 01:20:42.760]   from removing pre-installed software or apps. That's going to hit the Android Google Play Store
[01:20:42.760 --> 01:20:48.520]   and the iOS app store. And also alternative payment methods are specifically spelled out there.
[01:20:48.520 --> 01:20:54.520]   There's a lot here that's specifically targeted at specific complaints. But on the other side of
[01:20:54.520 --> 01:21:02.920]   that, the GDPR, the huge sweeping privacy and security, personal security initiative that passed
[01:21:02.920 --> 01:21:09.320]   in the EU few years ago, has in practice for the past five, I think 2016 was it, in past five or
[01:21:09.320 --> 01:21:15.800]   six years. I mean, weasels got a weasel. You know, they've the companies that that need those
[01:21:15.800 --> 01:21:20.680]   technologies that needs those techniques, they found a way around it or they found that enforcement
[01:21:20.680 --> 01:21:27.480]   was pretty lax. So that doesn't bode well for the decision inside Apple, inside Google, inside
[01:21:27.480 --> 01:21:35.640]   Facebook saying, do we make our lives much, much more difficult? Do we risk our profit centers?
[01:21:35.640 --> 01:21:42.840]   Do we risk our five year strategy? Or do we just wait and see how much we can get away with before
[01:21:42.840 --> 01:21:46.040]   we decide to determine how much we actually have to do to comply with this stuff?
[01:21:46.760 --> 01:21:53.720]   I will say that I work in, we build a lot of stuff that interacts with customers and GDPR is the
[01:21:53.720 --> 01:21:58.360]   middle of every conversation. So it definitely has an impact. I don't know if it has an impact on
[01:21:58.360 --> 01:22:02.760]   Google and Facebook and Apple, but I can tell you that every major corporation that I work with
[01:22:02.760 --> 01:22:07.800]   wants to know exactly how we're managing information. And they mostly want to throw it away,
[01:22:07.800 --> 01:22:12.680]   because it's just seen as a liability at this point. And so they just don't want, they don't
[01:22:12.680 --> 01:22:16.440]   want to have, you know, we're like, hey, we could, people are interested in this, they'll probably want
[01:22:16.440 --> 01:22:20.120]   to get more information about that at some point. And nobody wants it. It's like, oh, this is a hot
[01:22:20.120 --> 01:22:26.440]   potato. Like until they, you know, there's so much legal stuff now to do it. But anyway,
[01:22:26.440 --> 01:22:31.640]   so it's a really interesting puzzle, but definitely GDPR definitely has an impact. I don't know if
[01:22:31.640 --> 01:22:35.560]   it's a good impact or a bad impact, but everybody talks about it. Well, and that's why you might
[01:22:35.560 --> 01:22:41.320]   wonder why does Facebook have ads on TV saying we want to be regulated, because then that's,
[01:22:41.320 --> 01:22:46.360]   this is the whole point of regulatory capture. If you're big enough, you don't, you can, you can
[01:22:46.360 --> 01:22:50.440]   weasel, as you said, and you can weasel your way around. It's the midsize companies and the
[01:22:50.440 --> 01:22:53.960]   smaller companies that you're working with Alex that have to really worry about this.
[01:22:53.960 --> 01:22:57.880]   When I say midsize, there's still fortune. They're still big, like they're not Google,
[01:22:57.880 --> 01:23:02.200]   Apple, Facebook, they're not fang. The competition regulation is sometimes so expensive at Dampers
[01:23:02.200 --> 01:23:06.840]   competition, which is exactly, which is why Facebook says, regulate us, please. Yes.
[01:23:07.640 --> 01:23:14.440]   Please translate here, please. Yeah. The other thing that maybe to this point, Reuters reports
[01:23:14.440 --> 01:23:19.640]   that it doesn't look like there's a huge budget for enforcement on this. So there is some question
[01:23:19.640 --> 01:23:26.680]   about these two new regulations and how enforced they will be. I don't know if I would bet the bank
[01:23:26.680 --> 01:23:30.360]   on that though, you never know, right? As soon as they start finding some people that have.
[01:23:30.360 --> 01:23:32.520]   Yeah, yeah. More money than all the budget.
[01:23:34.360 --> 01:23:41.560]   Oops. Mark Gurman says, I couldn't care less. The Apple Watch will feature temperature sensor.
[01:23:41.560 --> 01:23:48.120]   This is we are now the era of diminishing returns. A new Apple Watch 8. We'll know. We'll know if
[01:23:48.120 --> 01:23:53.800]   you have a fever and they'll be a big screen model. Well, 47 millimeter model. Yeah. In the world
[01:23:53.800 --> 01:23:57.800]   of COVID, that's not a well, I've been wearing a door. No, no, no, that's a good thing. I've been
[01:23:57.800 --> 01:24:02.120]   wearing an aura ring. That's done that for years. And graphs. Oh, I just thought it. Mind you like it?
[01:24:02.840 --> 01:24:07.240]   Yeah, I don't I don't wear it all the time because I don't like wearing rings to bed.
[01:24:07.240 --> 01:24:11.720]   I even take off my wedding ring when I go to bed. But if you don't mind wearing a ring,
[01:24:11.720 --> 01:24:16.520]   it's it's great. It's not great for exercise. But it's best at is that temperature monitoring,
[01:24:16.520 --> 01:24:20.440]   because it'll tell you if your temperature fluctuates also a heart rate variability,
[01:24:20.440 --> 01:24:24.280]   because it's really good on your finger at measuring heart rate. I think with all these
[01:24:24.280 --> 01:24:30.200]   things, I just find the data is just in sleep. Yeah. Sorry. I find the data to be I just find
[01:24:30.200 --> 01:24:33.240]   the data to be fascinating. Like I love that it gathers all that. I mean,
[01:24:33.240 --> 01:24:37.640]   you know, I've been wearing it if I was if it wasn't Apple, but but I think that the gathering
[01:24:37.640 --> 01:24:40.520]   the data is a lot of fun. I don't know if I've mentioned this on this show, but I've been wearing
[01:24:40.520 --> 01:24:44.920]   a continuous glucose monitor lately. It turns out you can get you can just get these.
[01:24:44.920 --> 01:24:51.240]   You know, they're companies that will, you know, for for a quantified self will, you know,
[01:24:51.240 --> 01:24:56.360]   athletes and so forth. A lot of a lot of athletes, I was talking to my friend who's
[01:24:57.320 --> 01:25:01.960]   her high or college softball team all wore them, because it tells you it gives you
[01:25:01.960 --> 01:25:06.280]   continuous feedback on glucose. That's a metric. You can really see how if they can
[01:25:06.280 --> 01:25:10.440]   figure out how that's going to work in an Apple watch, you can really see where we're headed in
[01:25:10.440 --> 01:25:15.640]   10 years. Yeah. You'll know you'll you'll have some I presume they'll figure out ways to measure
[01:25:15.640 --> 01:25:22.600]   you know, blood stuff. Yeah, I have to admit, I did measure my glucose for a while. And that's why
[01:25:22.600 --> 01:25:27.560]   I really stopped eating bread. Yes. You see it goes through the road. Really screwing me up.
[01:25:27.560 --> 01:25:32.840]   But like every bagel crashes takes its toll. Oh my gosh. Yeah, like I was like that definitely
[01:25:32.840 --> 01:25:37.000]   got out of my diet really quickly. Oh my gosh. Yeah, I'll have little bits of it, but I'm like,
[01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:41.960]   Oh, that's a it's my personality too, because if I if I know that I'm going to eat that bagel,
[01:25:41.960 --> 01:25:47.800]   and then I'm going to see that in a graph later in the day. Yeah, exactly. I'm aware of that. Yeah,
[01:25:47.800 --> 01:25:52.520]   it's like, okay, there's a little top on my show on my arm here. That's a very big deal
[01:25:52.520 --> 01:25:59.000]   to build. Not the the bad side of this is when you're trying to you're trying to get an appointment
[01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:02.680]   with your doctor every time that something on your watch says, Hey, something is a little bit high,
[01:26:02.680 --> 01:26:07.960]   something is as unusual for you. But the real power is when you start to you you're just aware
[01:26:07.960 --> 01:26:12.040]   of what these numbers are and you're aware of G that time where I was just really low
[01:26:12.040 --> 01:26:16.840]   key all day long or that time where I really couldn't focus on anything or and if you have like
[01:26:16.840 --> 01:26:21.640]   if you just simply say G that's on that seems unusual that I know what I feel like normally I
[01:26:21.640 --> 01:26:26.760]   didn't feel normal. Let me just take a look at these this panoply of numbers and over time,
[01:26:26.760 --> 01:26:31.320]   see if I can correlate with Oh, wow, that was the that was also for the past two or three days,
[01:26:31.320 --> 01:26:36.440]   like I have them, you know, my blood pressure has been like this, my body temperature has been
[01:26:36.440 --> 01:26:42.600]   like this, my blood glucose has been like this. I haven't so I have so far, I was unaware that
[01:26:42.600 --> 01:26:47.160]   you could do a continuous glucose monitoring over the counter. Well, it's not over the counter.
[01:26:47.160 --> 01:26:51.240]   They do write a prescription for you, but it's okay. It's kind of like getting viagra. I mean,
[01:26:51.240 --> 01:26:53.880]   there's just some guy, some doctor somewhere's writing the scripts.
[01:26:53.880 --> 01:27:02.840]   Yeah, but you put it on your arm. It does not hurt. You're kind of aware of it. Last two weeks,
[01:27:02.840 --> 01:27:07.640]   it's not cheap. It's like a hundred bucks per but and I would, you know, I don't know if you need
[01:27:07.640 --> 01:27:12.360]   to do it for long, but boy, you do it for one month. I just feel like I'm not recommending this for
[01:27:12.360 --> 01:27:16.200]   everybody. I'm type two diabetic. So it is probably important for me to monitor this. But in fact,
[01:27:16.200 --> 01:27:21.160]   I used to prick my finger, which is a lot better than doing that. But it does give me a win
[01:27:21.160 --> 01:27:27.560]   though into what this future holds. And exactly as you said, Alex, in genetics, they talk about
[01:27:27.560 --> 01:27:33.240]   matching the genotype to the phenotype. Once you understand what your genes do to your,
[01:27:33.240 --> 01:27:36.840]   you know, your medical situation, you can start linking these together.
[01:27:36.840 --> 01:27:42.680]   I think this is going to revolutionize health medicine. All about fitness.
[01:27:42.680 --> 01:27:47.880]   I was thinking most of it gives me data that reinforces.
[01:27:48.440 --> 01:27:53.160]   What you already know, basically, well, don't eat a lot of sugar. Yeah. Eat, eat, eat,
[01:27:53.160 --> 01:27:56.200]   eat mostly, mostly fresh foods, mostly vegetables. You don't like,
[01:27:56.200 --> 01:28:00.760]   know it. Turns out it turns out like everything Michael Poland said in in forks over knives is
[01:28:00.760 --> 01:28:05.720]   yet pretty much the truth. Eat food. Now I have data that tells me that he was right. Yeah.
[01:28:05.720 --> 01:28:09.000]   What is the quote? Eat food, mostly vegetables, not too much.
[01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:12.760]   Eat real food, I think. Mostly vegetables, not too much. Yeah.
[01:28:14.280 --> 01:28:20.520]   That's why like one of the holy grails of fitness watches is a continuous glucose monitor,
[01:28:20.520 --> 01:28:26.040]   that monitoring that's not invasive. And as soon as they crack that as soon as they make it reliable,
[01:28:26.040 --> 01:28:30.120]   that's going to be that's going to be a health revolution. You talk about, I mean,
[01:28:30.120 --> 01:28:33.560]   it's great that you're telling me that, hey, you might be having a heart attack. You might want to,
[01:28:33.560 --> 01:28:37.400]   I'm going to call 911 for you. That's absolute. And that's that's the dramatic stuff that makes
[01:28:37.400 --> 01:28:41.800]   the great commercials. But it's the people, it's the times when it will just simply say,
[01:28:41.800 --> 01:28:46.200]   by the way, here is what here is what your blue blood glucose level has been doing today.
[01:28:46.200 --> 01:28:51.720]   And when you say, oh, that time where I just could not focus on anything was what did I do?
[01:28:51.720 --> 01:28:56.760]   Just before two 10 in the afternoon, that's the time that eight half that bag of M&M's because
[01:28:56.760 --> 01:29:01.160]   quote they were going or they're about to go bad on quote. Maybe I should not do that.
[01:29:01.160 --> 01:29:08.840]   Mexican cola in fact is no better than American cola. It's spiking your glucose.
[01:29:08.840 --> 01:29:13.320]   And I think that I think the thing is as we get more of that data, and we've talked about this before,
[01:29:13.320 --> 01:29:17.240]   is that especially as it's anonymized and pushed back into the system, which
[01:29:17.240 --> 01:29:20.680]   apples one of the only companies that most people are going to trust enough to let that happen,
[01:29:20.680 --> 01:29:26.600]   is that it is it's incredible. It's going to be able to get to a point where it goes,
[01:29:26.600 --> 01:29:35.000]   your expected lifespan is 73 years or whatever based on all the data that we have, or that
[01:29:35.720 --> 01:29:43.720]   we see some precursors. We see these precursors that are Lisa just told me that science says
[01:29:43.720 --> 01:29:49.160]   every hot dog I ate takes 32 minutes off my life. Yeah, that's not a step.
[01:29:49.160 --> 01:29:56.120]   All I was going to say is that is that is that is that is that it's but what's more important is
[01:29:56.120 --> 01:30:00.600]   not so much you're going to have a heart attack in five minutes. It's saying long term. We see precursors
[01:30:00.600 --> 01:30:05.560]   that say that you may have a heart attack in the next year based on what we see right now.
[01:30:05.560 --> 01:30:11.160]   And this data would be unachieve untrackable because it's lots of data over time that we could
[01:30:11.160 --> 01:30:16.040]   never get before. Well, also for public health recommendations. Exactly. I mean, imagine the
[01:30:16.040 --> 01:30:20.840]   things we will know. It's going to be a total revolution there, but the question is can they
[01:30:20.840 --> 01:30:25.640]   I mean, they're having a hard time making a non-invasive blood sugar measurement system.
[01:30:26.440 --> 01:30:31.480]   It works great in the lab, but you don't you can't get it certified. I mean, the Apple had the
[01:30:31.480 --> 01:30:35.960]   everybody had the technology for temperature readings. This question of is it even reading the
[01:30:35.960 --> 01:30:41.560]   temperature at your skin on a device that was pressed to your skin all the time. Here's how long
[01:30:41.560 --> 01:30:46.680]   it took for Apple to get it certified so that they can excuse me hopefully get it certified this year.
[01:30:46.680 --> 01:30:52.360]   But Alex Alex I was going to say the whole that you often talk about like how Apple like maybe
[01:30:52.360 --> 01:30:56.600]   trying to become a bank or maybe that'd be a good idea for it to become a bank. And now I finally see
[01:30:56.600 --> 01:31:02.840]   the synergy where like as the as the health technology gets much much better and says hey,
[01:31:02.840 --> 01:31:08.520]   this hot dog is going to take a year off your life. I want if Apple is also like has a track my
[01:31:08.520 --> 01:31:14.680]   finances, it will say at this point you will probably live until 82. Unfortunately, your retirement
[01:31:14.680 --> 01:31:19.240]   savings will let will go out at 77. So you know what have that pizza.
[01:31:20.840 --> 01:31:23.720]   It's probably not going to be a good five years. You're listening.
[01:31:23.720 --> 01:31:24.840]   We're living on the screen.
[01:31:24.840 --> 01:31:30.120]   A holistic calculation you probably want to include some of those other my mom I got her
[01:31:30.120 --> 01:31:34.280]   so you know because she's 89 and if she falls I want to you know wanted to be able to get help.
[01:31:34.280 --> 01:31:39.320]   I got her an Apple watch. She loves it. I was very happy when I got there to see she was wearing it.
[01:31:39.320 --> 01:31:44.440]   She also said and every once in a while be sitting there the watch says your heart right is spiking
[01:31:44.440 --> 01:31:49.880]   and you're not moving as as it does. She calls her doctor and the doctor says, yeah, don't yeah,
[01:31:49.880 --> 01:31:51.480]   don't worry about that.
[01:31:51.480 --> 01:31:55.800]   Yeah, because you're 89 I guess. I don't know. I mean, I don't know.
[01:31:55.800 --> 01:32:01.240]   No, that's that's exactly right. And this is this is part of the danger of these devices there.
[01:32:01.240 --> 01:32:05.960]   As any of us who have had who have elderly relatives or have had elderly relatives know,
[01:32:05.960 --> 01:32:13.480]   there is a point at which yes, this is the patient is 83 84. Yes, you have this medical problem.
[01:32:13.480 --> 01:32:19.320]   However, the intervention for addressing this problem is probably going to cause greater health
[01:32:19.320 --> 01:32:25.800]   problems than just simply maybe maybe maybe switch from from a longboard skateboard to an electric
[01:32:25.800 --> 01:32:30.520]   skateboard to put less to thrust in your heart. I brought her up like life. Life change in response.
[01:32:30.520 --> 01:32:37.720]   I said mom have more time cakes. I know that I know if a hot dog takes 32 minutes off your life,
[01:32:37.720 --> 01:32:42.280]   this is got to take an hour off your life. Well, they are so good. It's worth it. Oh, God.
[01:32:43.640 --> 01:32:48.280]   I think this is this is this is probably gonna convince you not to come visit me, but I can walk
[01:32:48.280 --> 01:32:54.520]   with half a mile that way for clam cakes and chowder or a quarter mile that way for
[01:32:54.520 --> 01:33:00.840]   clam cakes and chowder. I mean, I'm in the irresistible orbit of two different gravity wells of
[01:33:00.840 --> 01:33:05.880]   clam cakes and chowder. So the place we went in Providence is kind of a new voe place.
[01:33:05.880 --> 01:33:12.040]   Doo Doon Brothers founded by you know, chefs. The food was so good. And I've never had a better
[01:33:12.040 --> 01:33:16.840]   clam cake. Oh, okay. Enough. People are going clam cakes. What are they talking about?
[01:33:16.840 --> 01:33:23.880]   What are they? What are they? A crumble coffee? I imagine imagine a beignet only for seafood for
[01:33:23.880 --> 01:33:30.600]   for for for a mollus. A mollus imagine a beignet without the show. They do not even
[01:33:30.600 --> 01:33:38.280]   suggest. No powdered sugar. Apple TV makes San Diego Comic Con debut with lineup of fan favorite
[01:33:38.280 --> 01:33:43.880]   critically acclaimed series. Severance for all mankind see invasion foundation and mythic quicks.
[01:33:43.880 --> 01:33:49.240]   Yeah, when you look at it this way, you could see why. Go ahead. I was gonna say they have an
[01:33:49.240 --> 01:33:54.920]   immersive severance experience. Isn't that just inviting people to apple park? Severance,
[01:33:54.920 --> 01:34:02.120]   in case you don't know, is a is Ben Stiller's take on a dystopian work, bat life balance.
[01:34:04.600 --> 01:34:11.400]   At first, it was a little because it's kind of sensorally deprived. The first few episodes
[01:34:11.400 --> 01:34:16.200]   is like, I don't know. But by the end of it, and when it ends, so suddenly you're going,
[01:34:16.200 --> 01:34:22.600]   give me more. Give me more. I talk about Skinner boxes. So what is this? Is it a VR experience?
[01:34:22.600 --> 01:34:26.840]   What is this immersive severance? They just make you work.
[01:34:26.840 --> 01:34:33.080]   You just got a macro data. A macro data. All this hysterical. We'll find out. Comic Con.
[01:34:33.080 --> 01:34:38.280]   Here's July 21st. Congratulations for the next 20 minutes. You're going to be processing app
[01:34:38.280 --> 01:34:43.160]   store submissions. There's a big button mark. Deny and a tiny green button. If you can find it
[01:34:43.160 --> 01:34:48.440]   on a green background, they're gonna cast members will be there. Executive producer and director
[01:34:48.440 --> 01:34:53.240]   Ben Stiller will be their creator. Dan Erickson will be there. Sounds like fun for all mankind.
[01:34:53.240 --> 01:34:58.600]   This makes me Rob McElenney will be there with mythic quests. This makes me want to go.
[01:34:58.600 --> 01:35:04.680]   You would finish foundation. No. It's interesting. You said that John did. He says he did. I did not.
[01:35:04.680 --> 01:35:08.920]   Was it worth it? I keep trying. I keep trying to watch it. I've got bored. It's very disappointing.
[01:35:08.920 --> 01:35:13.800]   Just so slow. Like get an element of the book. John says he liked it, but you know, he likes it.
[01:35:13.800 --> 01:35:16.600]   There you go. Like that. Well, a waffle party. I got some point.
[01:35:16.600 --> 01:35:21.240]   Maybe that's what the except for it's a waffle party. You get a waffle party. You wear a Steve
[01:35:21.240 --> 01:35:26.520]   Jobs hat instead of a those spoilers. But a waffle party is a very important part of
[01:35:27.240 --> 01:35:32.120]   the work life. I think this is all just an excuse for Tim Cook to finally come out with his with
[01:35:32.120 --> 01:35:41.240]   his Wolverine cosplay. That would be great. That's so awesome. He just wants to finally be able to
[01:35:41.240 --> 01:35:47.000]   tax deduct it after three years. I'm telling you. Here's Zach Cherry having his waffle party.
[01:35:49.480 --> 01:35:59.160]   All by himself. Wow. And congratulations, Steve Jobs receiving the
[01:35:59.160 --> 01:36:07.480]   Medal of Honor, the highest civilian award in the United States. He is seven among 17 honorees.
[01:36:07.480 --> 01:36:12.120]   His board, of course, posthumous. I don't know if I heard yet if Lorraine Powell
[01:36:12.120 --> 01:36:19.240]   Jobs will be going to the White House on July 7th to accept for him. I certainly hope so.
[01:36:19.240 --> 01:36:27.960]   Yeah, it's it's it's interesting that the president, every single administration gets to sort of make
[01:36:27.960 --> 01:36:33.080]   comments about what he thinks is great about America, what's great about his vision of the current
[01:36:33.080 --> 01:36:37.640]   the past and the future. And a little few people might think, Oh, well, he doesn't sound Steve Jobs
[01:36:37.640 --> 01:36:41.720]   doesn't sound like a civil rights better than your rush limbaugh. Let me say that. Yeah, well,
[01:36:41.720 --> 01:36:46.840]   let's let's let's just let's just say that there's a masterist nest anybody who got anything awarded by
[01:36:46.840 --> 01:36:54.360]   by by by Trump. But but but but but the but the in the declaration is highlighted like not not
[01:36:54.360 --> 01:36:59.640]   only was legitimately he led some very creative and very innovative companies, but also the
[01:36:59.640 --> 01:37:03.480]   contributions that he made to account to the economy. And that's part of what the port what
[01:37:03.480 --> 01:37:09.320]   the portfolio of this award is all about. I can't imagine anybody debating the merits of Steve
[01:37:09.320 --> 01:37:15.160]   just going the middle of honor. That's absolutely a fun moment for me. Yeah, finally. Yeah. Yeah.
[01:37:15.160 --> 01:37:18.840]   I mean, but when we look when you look at the when you look at the other nominees,
[01:37:18.840 --> 01:37:26.520]   they're John McCain, Simone Biles, Megan Rapinoe, the soccer player, Senator Simpson Denzel Washington.
[01:37:26.520 --> 01:37:34.760]   Yeah, I mean, these are these are Gabby Giffords. These are great and appropriate recipients, but
[01:37:34.760 --> 01:37:39.480]   I think none more appropriate than Steve Jobs. Yeah, no, absolutely. Yeah. I mean, it's it's
[01:37:39.480 --> 01:37:44.280]   there are some awards where you get them because you're really, really rich and you donate a lot of
[01:37:44.280 --> 01:37:48.760]   money to the right causes. And one part of your payment for that is not only that you got an
[01:37:48.760 --> 01:37:53.240]   exemption in your on your taxes for basically where you've been hiding your money, but also
[01:37:53.240 --> 01:37:58.040]   that okay, you get to have this congressional, whatever, whatever, whatever. But this is this is
[01:37:58.040 --> 01:38:04.520]   legit. If the only thing Steve Jobs had done is introduce the iPhone that has
[01:38:04.520 --> 01:38:09.080]   totally transformed our society in the last 15 years. I mean, right?
[01:38:09.080 --> 01:38:16.040]   Absolutely. Yeah, I mean, I can't imagine any technology since the wheel or fire
[01:38:16.040 --> 01:38:20.360]   that has made such a difference in our day to day lives. And you might say, well, I'm an
[01:38:20.360 --> 01:38:25.400]   Android user, but believe me, that Android phone you're carrying is an exact copy of the iPhone
[01:38:25.400 --> 01:38:32.040]   Googling the sooner right now. But not but not but not only that, but and if that were
[01:38:32.040 --> 01:38:35.880]   specifically what he was called out for, a lot of people would say, well, he didn't invent the
[01:38:35.880 --> 01:38:41.000]   iPhone. He was like, he basically funded it. And he put that's a good question. Does the
[01:38:41.000 --> 01:38:47.320]   iPhone exist with that Steve? But but it's not only that, but again, he under Apple, under his
[01:38:47.320 --> 01:38:52.920]   leadership, Apple went from a breaking on the edge company to one of the most no the most valuable
[01:38:52.920 --> 01:38:56.680]   private company in the world that is an American company. And the sick the commercial
[01:38:56.680 --> 01:39:00.520]   successes that they have had, the jobs they've created, the amount of money they put into the
[01:39:00.520 --> 01:39:07.000]   economy has been just enormous. And that's not a small thing. It's not I think it would be very,
[01:39:07.000 --> 01:39:11.640]   very eyebrow raising if Elon Musk were given an award like this, because you'd have to ask, okay,
[01:39:11.640 --> 01:39:16.680]   you made yourself into the richest person in the world. And you created a platform so that people
[01:39:16.680 --> 01:39:23.400]   as rich as you could get selfies eating jelly beans and zero gravity. But how does that help
[01:39:23.400 --> 01:39:28.680]   the country? How does that help the the progress of humanity? I mean, it's most when how does your
[01:39:28.680 --> 01:39:32.520]   name sit amongst this list of people that we're talking about? I mean, there are at least two,
[01:39:32.520 --> 01:39:37.880]   there are two or maybe even three where there are quotes about Dr. Martin Luther King about how
[01:39:37.880 --> 01:39:45.160]   good a person this is this this person was. That's a lot to stand up to. Even Richard Trump to the
[01:39:45.160 --> 01:39:50.120]   other posthumous one that caught my eye Richard Trump, who was president of the AFL CIO. So that's
[01:39:50.120 --> 01:39:55.000]   a big call out to how important the labor movement is at least to the eyes of the administration.
[01:39:55.000 --> 01:40:00.280]   So yeah, this is this is a really, really good award. This is a good group of people to be with.
[01:40:00.280 --> 01:40:06.120]   There's there's nobody that when the picture is put on the wall of people's offices, there is
[01:40:06.120 --> 01:40:11.160]   nobody they're going to try to like crop out to say, yeah, but there was also that general who did
[01:40:11.160 --> 01:40:15.160]   all those war crimes that we're not talking about that came up three years later. Yeah.
[01:40:15.160 --> 01:40:19.880]   Plus a nice little Pixar cherry on top. Yeah, let's not forget Pixar.
[01:40:20.440 --> 01:40:27.240]   Yep. Again, consistent. Yeah. And it's not you don't get the honor because you're a nice guy.
[01:40:27.240 --> 01:40:29.960]   You might not have been the nicest guy in the world.
[01:40:29.960 --> 01:40:34.440]   Nice. Nice. You're pretty denting. Don't affect social change, unfortunately.
[01:40:34.440 --> 01:40:40.440]   Nice people start the start the ball rolling and it's the people who are saying, okay,
[01:40:40.440 --> 01:40:44.520]   you're not paying attention. So we're going to make things really freaking awkward until you
[01:40:44.520 --> 01:40:48.760]   listen to this issue that we need to address right here and right now. And now the Rene Richie
[01:40:48.760 --> 01:40:55.320]   Pokemon go segment Pokemon go creator. Niantic cuts 8% of staff cancels four projects.
[01:40:55.320 --> 01:41:04.280]   But I think Pokemon go is still a go. In fact, yes, they now have campfire social AR app for
[01:41:04.280 --> 01:41:10.760]   Pokemon go players. What have you gotten into the campfire? I haven't. I didn't believe that I
[01:41:10.760 --> 01:41:16.760]   needed an adjacent social experience. It's social enough, but it was it was always wonder though. Go
[01:41:16.760 --> 01:41:21.080]   ahead. I was going to say I do wonder like there's this trend in Silicon Valley and I don't know if
[01:41:21.080 --> 01:41:24.760]   this applies to Niantic or to Tesla or to which companies it does, but where they seem to over
[01:41:24.760 --> 01:41:30.680]   higher, and then call like 10%. And it seems like just like the worst form of stack ranking imaginable.
[01:41:30.680 --> 01:41:35.400]   We I mean, I'll say something in their defense. We we had layoff string COVID.
[01:41:35.400 --> 01:41:41.640]   When you're flush and everything's going well, there's a lot of positions you want to fill.
[01:41:43.080 --> 01:41:47.160]   And there were there are a lot of great people we had to let go because we just we could literally
[01:41:47.160 --> 01:41:53.160]   could not afford to keep them. They're they're positions that you want filled when you have the
[01:41:53.160 --> 01:41:58.280]   money, but you don't it's like paint in your house. If you have the money, you paint the house.
[01:41:58.280 --> 01:42:03.640]   But if you don't, you don't. I make you some dream games too, like the Transformers game.
[01:42:03.640 --> 01:42:07.880]   Well, I think probably they learned their lesson with Harry Potter.
[01:42:09.160 --> 01:42:15.240]   Not all AR games are equal. Yeah. And also a lot of entertainment companies,
[01:42:15.240 --> 01:42:19.880]   all the streamers are contracting right now. They are figuring out what projects we're
[01:42:19.880 --> 01:42:25.000]   hopeful that we can we can get away with canceling them. It's just a different environment. Right.
[01:42:25.000 --> 01:42:32.920]   And you know, it's a it hurt me to let anybody go. It always hurts you. And it makes you I
[01:42:32.920 --> 01:42:36.200]   have to be honest. I'm gonna go out cyclically. So you don't like you don't strike me as any like,
[01:42:36.200 --> 01:42:39.800]   but some of these companies do it like regularly. It's like it's almost like a pattern. They call
[01:42:39.800 --> 01:42:44.920]   it right sizing, right? Yeah, then that's over higher and then sort and then over higher and then
[01:42:44.920 --> 01:42:51.000]   sort. Maybe they do do that. I wouldn't be surprised. I layoffs are so painful and so horrific.
[01:42:51.000 --> 01:42:56.760]   I never want to do them. And it makes you not want to hire more people, even though you might
[01:42:56.760 --> 01:43:03.080]   need a bunch of companies last week. It was really hard part as I fought laying people off.
[01:43:03.080 --> 01:43:06.120]   I mean, tooth and nail, you know, until until I lay everybody off.
[01:43:06.120 --> 01:43:11.960]   So there is a sense to that. Yeah, it's good. It's good to be, you know, like practical and
[01:43:11.960 --> 01:43:15.720]   safe. If I laid off half of them, I probably could have exactly wouldn't have had to lay them all
[01:43:15.720 --> 01:43:20.280]   out. Yeah. So so the thing is, so I think that's the thing you have to the hardest part with all
[01:43:20.280 --> 01:43:25.800]   layoffs or anything else is that the most one of the most expensive resources for any company is
[01:43:25.800 --> 01:43:31.000]   labor, you know, and so and it's just so that's why you fight, you know, even small raises and all
[01:43:31.000 --> 01:43:36.600]   kinds of other things that that math multiplied by 10,000 or 12,000 or whatever is really complicated,
[01:43:36.600 --> 01:43:41.640]   you know, and so are millions. And so it's so you just, you know, well, it's more than the salary,
[01:43:41.640 --> 01:43:47.960]   it's benefits. I mean, yeah, so it's it's expensive and you need people. There's no,
[01:43:47.960 --> 01:43:52.040]   there's no company without the people. And you're right, Alex, that that's part of the,
[01:43:52.040 --> 01:43:58.680]   thank God, I have Lisa because she's super smart in that. And that that's it. You know,
[01:43:58.680 --> 01:44:02.200]   we're we have to cut off the arm to save the body.
[01:44:02.200 --> 01:44:08.280]   So again, when you're when you're growing, you the biggest problem people have is they don't grow,
[01:44:08.280 --> 01:44:12.600]   they don't grow with fast enough. You don't have the people and then you make mistakes and
[01:44:12.600 --> 01:44:17.000]   things don't come out and then you can't grow because you didn't have the resources that you
[01:44:17.000 --> 01:44:22.440]   needed. And so under resourcing your growth is is a huge issue. So most companies will throw people
[01:44:22.440 --> 01:44:28.120]   at people and resources at it so that they can try to take advantage of the wave. And then when
[01:44:28.120 --> 01:44:32.040]   they get to the other side, well, some of it made it and some of it didn't and then they have to
[01:44:32.040 --> 01:44:37.160]   scale down. I'll be honest, until I ran a company, I had no idea. I don't think you know. Yeah. Until
[01:44:37.160 --> 01:44:44.120]   you do it. And then you know, it's hard. Even, you know, even even as I've never owned a company,
[01:44:44.120 --> 01:44:49.320]   except for me with my one employee, myself, my bully, it's hard to lay yourself off. Right.
[01:44:49.320 --> 01:44:55.240]   But but nonetheless, like I've been like my all my book projects, I've been like 10 to 12 books
[01:44:55.240 --> 01:45:00.680]   before that became a dumb thing to do. And there I know that there are people who are freelancers
[01:45:00.680 --> 01:45:07.000]   who are working for me to do certain editing work to do certain prep work for me. And there are
[01:45:07.000 --> 01:45:12.440]   times where it's like, Oh my God, this publisher is being such a bunch of blanks about this. And
[01:45:12.440 --> 01:45:16.600]   if I could possibly get out of finishing this book, because I'm just as tomb, the fight is too
[01:45:16.600 --> 01:45:21.800]   much to be beyond just simply writing this book. And what stays my hand is, yeah, but there are
[01:45:21.800 --> 01:45:26.840]   people who are expected who are basically going to be getting 10 to 20 to $30,000 over the next
[01:45:26.840 --> 01:45:31.560]   five to six months based on the work that I'm giving them. And they probably made plans
[01:45:31.560 --> 01:45:37.640]   based on that. And so that's got to keep me eating, eating dirt on certain things for a couple of
[01:45:37.640 --> 01:45:42.760]   months. I can't risk them canceling this project. You know, I'm happy to walk away from this, but
[01:45:42.760 --> 01:45:47.640]   I'm not happy telling, you know, three or four or five people that, yeah, sorry, I knew that
[01:45:47.640 --> 01:45:51.960]   you're going to be paying your mortgage for the next year. Oh, it hurts. Oh, it hurts.
[01:45:51.960 --> 01:45:57.000]   And along those lines, I have an announcement to make, but we're going to do that right after
[01:45:57.000 --> 01:46:01.400]   this word from our sponsor. Boy, is that a terrible tease?
[01:46:01.400 --> 01:46:09.080]   Actually, they brought to you by quite literally brought to you by cash fly. We have been a
[01:46:09.080 --> 01:46:15.400]   happy cash fly customers for more than a decade cash fly came to Twitch rescue in the early days.
[01:46:15.400 --> 01:46:21.000]   When we could not figure out how to get our files to you guys, we were doing all sorts of things.
[01:46:21.000 --> 01:46:24.840]   The website wasn't big enough. I couldn't afford the bandwidth there. But then we tried BitTorrent.
[01:46:24.840 --> 01:46:30.280]   Remember that? And I was asking people to see it. And then we tried AOL and was with all
[01:46:30.280 --> 01:46:35.480]   fortunately, Matt Levine from cash fly. The founder came to us and said, I think we can help. And
[01:46:35.480 --> 01:46:41.400]   they have been helping ever since cash flies. Amazing. We love them. And now they have some new
[01:46:41.400 --> 01:46:46.440]   stuff that I think you might be very interested in, including cash flies new,
[01:46:46.440 --> 01:46:54.840]   ultra low latency video streaming, less than one second latency. You can go live in hours,
[01:46:54.840 --> 01:47:01.160]   not days, ditch that unreliable web RTC solution for their WebSocket live video workflow.
[01:47:01.160 --> 01:47:05.720]   And here's, here's, well, it's not even the best part. The best part. There's so many best parts.
[01:47:05.720 --> 01:47:13.080]   One of the best parts, you could stream to millions of users. It's scalable beyond your wildest dreams.
[01:47:13.080 --> 01:47:19.240]   You'll also be reaching your audience closer to the where they are with 50 points of presence
[01:47:19.240 --> 01:47:23.800]   around the globe. Content is going to be closer to your customers, which is a lot better than a
[01:47:23.800 --> 01:47:28.840]   local CDN. They also have something they call cash fly storage optimization system. And this,
[01:47:28.840 --> 01:47:34.040]   I know about because we've been using this for a long time, kind of in a prototype version. Now,
[01:47:34.040 --> 01:47:38.440]   they're making it available to customers. Take a load off your origin servers, reduce your S3
[01:47:38.440 --> 01:47:46.600]   bills, reduce your bandwidth, increase your cash at ratio to 100% cash flies storage optimization
[01:47:46.600 --> 01:47:51.880]   system. They also have fully managed CDN solutions if you need them. And I think you might,
[01:47:51.880 --> 01:47:56.440]   with their elite managed packages, you get VIP treatment. And I can vouch for that 24/7.
[01:47:56.440 --> 01:48:01.480]   He supports response times in less than an hour. Cash flies is the best.
[01:48:01.480 --> 01:48:06.760]   Ultra low latency video streaming, lightning fast gaming, faster download, zero lag,
[01:48:06.760 --> 01:48:12.840]   glitches or outages, mobile content optimization that delivers automatic and simple image optimization.
[01:48:12.840 --> 01:48:18.520]   So your site loads faster on any device. Multiple CDNs for redundancy and failover. In fact,
[01:48:18.520 --> 01:48:27.160]   they're so reliable over the last 12 months, a 100% availability. 100%, 30% faster than other
[01:48:27.160 --> 01:48:33.960]   major CDNs, 10 times faster than traditional methods. They're on six continents, a 98% cash
[01:48:33.960 --> 01:48:40.120]   hit ratio. I just, you can't do better. Trust me. And I know you can't do better than cash fly.
[01:48:40.120 --> 01:48:47.000]   Best of all, with their 24/7, 365 day a year priority support, you know they're always there
[01:48:47.000 --> 01:48:51.640]   for you when you need them. They always have been for us. Just can't thank you enough cash fly.
[01:48:51.640 --> 01:49:00.040]   Learn more at cashfly.com. That's C-A-C-H-E-F-L-Y.com. Thank you, cash fly.
[01:49:00.040 --> 01:49:08.360]   Alex Lindsey, pick of the week time. I'm working on a new podcast, not me. I'm not in it, but it is
[01:49:08.360 --> 01:49:15.800]   on cash fly. Oh, nice. Your timing is perfect. Yeah. So about six months ago, a little over six
[01:49:15.800 --> 01:49:21.560]   months ago, we had Michael Krasney, who you probably are from me. I love Michael. Professor San Francisco
[01:49:21.560 --> 01:49:28.200]   State and the host for a long time of KQED's interview, morning interview show. For every day,
[01:49:28.200 --> 01:49:33.720]   every weekday. I've been on the show. It's great. I love Michael. How long? How many years did he do
[01:49:33.720 --> 01:49:38.600]   that? 28 years. 28 years now. For that interviewing people every day. And so he,
[01:49:38.600 --> 01:49:44.520]   he, forum was such a good friend. He retired from forum. And a lot of us were like, well, we really
[01:49:44.520 --> 01:49:50.840]   want Michael back. We just want Michael Krasney back. And so we, so, so, you know, for the last six
[01:49:50.840 --> 01:49:54.680]   months, you know, he and I would talk a little bit on and off. And then he was like, well, I don't
[01:49:54.680 --> 01:49:58.680]   know how to do this. And I was like, well, I can, I can help. So you might know a little bit about
[01:49:58.680 --> 01:50:03.960]   that. Couple of us, couple of us started kind of helping out. And so we've, we've set up the
[01:50:03.960 --> 01:50:09.880]   great gray matter podcast was really gray matter, like the gray areas to talk about and, and really
[01:50:09.880 --> 01:50:16.200]   thinking through things. And so, so we, we have the first episode is actually out today. If you go
[01:50:16.200 --> 01:50:22.680]   to gray matter dot show, you can spell it either way. And you should end up there. And we have Dr.
[01:50:22.680 --> 01:50:28.520]   Robert Walker, who's, who's really been in the middle of the COVID-19. Oh, he's great. So, yes,
[01:50:28.520 --> 01:50:33.880]   it's a really good, really good first episode. And what's funny with, with, with Michael Krasney
[01:50:33.880 --> 01:50:37.480]   is that the moment, you know, like he's like talking, you're talking, and then he just turns
[01:50:37.480 --> 01:50:41.640]   it on. And it's immediately a show again, like it's the same show. Now, the only thing that we're
[01:50:41.640 --> 01:50:45.320]   changing is, and we're going to open this up to more people. So you want, you want to sign up on
[01:50:45.320 --> 01:50:51.160]   the website, we're going to start letting people actually into ask questions. And so instead of
[01:50:51.160 --> 01:50:55.320]   doing the call ins, we're using Mcconna, you know, the Q and A system that I have here. And there's
[01:50:55.320 --> 01:51:00.600]   people listening on zoom. So when we do the shows, we're doing them over zoom. And there's a small
[01:51:00.600 --> 01:51:03.960]   group of people right now, couple, you know, there's 50 or 60 people, but it'll get a little bit
[01:51:03.960 --> 01:51:09.160]   bigger. And we're going to invite people in to be part of that live audience that listens and
[01:51:09.160 --> 01:51:14.360]   during that record, you know, kind of puts that together. So, so if you're, if you're interested,
[01:51:14.360 --> 01:51:17.560]   you can sign up there and we're going to get, we're going to reach out to folks in a couple weeks.
[01:51:17.560 --> 01:51:21.640]   Oh, we've got a couple great ones in the can that we've recorded that are going to start coming out
[01:51:21.640 --> 01:51:26.440]   once a week. And, you know, it's just really good conversations. He's so, he's so good.
[01:51:26.440 --> 01:51:30.760]   Oh, he's lucky to have teamed up with you too, because you've got the perfect platform to do this.
[01:51:31.480 --> 01:51:35.400]   Yeah, yeah, it's really great. Yeah. It's mostly office. It's all office hours folks right now and
[01:51:35.400 --> 01:51:40.280]   they're they're they're they're gentle. You can't help starting companies.
[01:51:40.280 --> 01:51:44.200]   Can you, Alex is so funny. I'm just helping out.
[01:51:44.200 --> 01:51:50.280]   But I think that Oh, Shannon Cooper's producing it. That's awesome. Yeah. Yeah.
[01:51:50.280 --> 01:51:56.200]   Shannon. So that so it's and anyway, so I think it's I think it's going to be a really exciting
[01:51:56.200 --> 01:52:01.320]   podcast and it's just going to do exactly what form did pretty much except for that again,
[01:52:01.320 --> 01:52:06.440]   the shows are going to be you're going to have the opportunity to watch the live recording
[01:52:06.440 --> 01:52:11.400]   where you can ask questions and vote on questions and so on and so forth. And then the podcast will
[01:52:11.400 --> 01:52:16.760]   will go out from there. So so anyway, it's a different model or, you know, like where he's and
[01:52:16.760 --> 01:52:22.680]   Michael is just kind of weaving the audience questions into the whole show. So it's works out
[01:52:22.680 --> 01:52:25.960]   really well. So anyway, it's a new new way of doing it. We're going to see how it turns out.
[01:52:25.960 --> 01:52:32.120]   Just launched today. Gray matter dot show. By the way, this just didn't thank you,
[01:52:32.120 --> 01:52:40.120]   chatroom, according to an Easter egg in MKB HD's video. Whoops. Whoops. I wear a nightmare.
[01:52:40.120 --> 01:52:45.240]   Yeah, no kidding. Marquez and you don't have to comment on this Renee because you probably have
[01:52:45.240 --> 01:52:53.240]   inside information. But Marquez briefly, I've done this briefly showed his calendar. Quick frame
[01:52:53.240 --> 01:52:59.480]   shows the calendar widget on his phone's home screen and you can clearly see Apple MBA briefing,
[01:52:59.480 --> 01:53:06.280]   MacBook Air briefing scheduled for Thursday, this Thursday, July 7th, which you might
[01:53:07.000 --> 01:53:17.560]   assume means the MacBook Air will be available for order the following day. Whoops. He's reviewing
[01:53:17.560 --> 01:53:25.240]   by the way an Android phone. So this is just a little slip. These things happen. I would I would
[01:53:25.240 --> 01:53:29.560]   guess if the briefing if he's having a briefing on Thursday and you can tell you can tell I'm privy
[01:53:29.560 --> 01:53:34.520]   to nothing by the fact that I'm speculating openly about this. My guess would be that he's
[01:53:35.240 --> 01:53:41.240]   receiving product that day or fr- excuse me, if he were not Marquez Brownlee, if he were on a normal
[01:53:41.240 --> 01:53:46.360]   level of normal level of godliness, not the Marquez level of godliness, that would mean that he's
[01:53:46.360 --> 01:53:50.760]   getting it shortly or has just received it. We'll have one week with it before it can go public and
[01:53:50.760 --> 01:53:55.560]   that would be the following Friday. I would guess the pre-orders on Friday and
[01:53:55.560 --> 01:54:00.680]   embargo lifts on Wednesday or Tuesday. That's probably Wednesday. Yeah.
[01:54:01.400 --> 01:54:07.080]   You're pick of the week, Andrew Enotko. We've already talked about understanding comics by Scott
[01:54:07.080 --> 01:54:12.280]   McCloud. So another endorsement for that because even if you're not into comics, even if you're not
[01:54:12.280 --> 01:54:17.720]   trying to get into comics, it really is a brilliant book about how storytelling work, how narrative
[01:54:17.720 --> 01:54:23.560]   works, how again, avatars, how characters, how perception, how understanding works. And don't get
[01:54:23.560 --> 01:54:28.760]   the Kindle version. Get the paperback. Yeah, exactly. Especially this because it's a comic book and
[01:54:28.760 --> 01:54:32.840]   it's brilliant. A lot of it is basically, he's taking advantage of the fact that he is using
[01:54:32.840 --> 01:54:38.120]   that own narrative device to actually show off how this narrative device works. It's kind of amazing
[01:54:38.120 --> 01:54:43.480]   really. It's a great book. It really is wonderful. I've owned a copy of it. It's one of those books
[01:54:43.480 --> 01:54:48.280]   that I keep having to buy again because I keep pulling it off a shelf and giving it to somebody
[01:54:48.280 --> 01:54:53.080]   as a way of saying that, yes, you say that you're going to go buy it, but I'm going to send you
[01:54:53.080 --> 01:54:57.960]   home with this because it's such a good book. The other thing is we enjoyed our conversation about
[01:54:57.960 --> 01:55:01.800]   like, you know, what got us into computing, vintage computing. It reminded me of one of these products
[01:55:01.800 --> 01:55:08.920]   projects to basically create a modern version of a Commodore 64 meeting with you control everything,
[01:55:08.920 --> 01:55:12.840]   you understand everything, all the chips that are on the board are commonly available. It's not
[01:55:12.840 --> 01:55:18.680]   proprietary. There's a really cool project trying to create a computer called the commander x16,
[01:55:18.680 --> 01:55:25.160]   which isn't necessarily a clone of the Commodore 64, but basically it's that in principle.
[01:55:25.160 --> 01:55:30.760]   And they've made a lot of progress in building this board and this computer. I think it's stalled
[01:55:30.760 --> 01:55:37.320]   a little bit because to their credit, they seem to be determined not to put anybody into bankruptcy
[01:55:37.320 --> 01:55:42.520]   or to make anybody lose any money in developing this. So that includes people preordering for a
[01:55:42.520 --> 01:55:46.760]   computer that doesn't exist and lose their money or the people who are developing this like saying,
[01:55:46.760 --> 01:55:52.920]   well, we need to put in $10,000 order to secure the manufacturing of this thing without knowing
[01:55:52.920 --> 01:55:57.400]   if anyone's going to buy it. So the hardware is stalled, but they have already put together,
[01:55:57.400 --> 01:56:02.440]   like the kernel is correct. The version of basic is correct. All these programming guides are
[01:56:02.440 --> 01:56:08.040]   correct. And so they have an emulator of the machine that they hope to build. So if you are,
[01:56:08.040 --> 01:56:13.240]   if you do want to get like a taste of what it was, what it was like in the 80s to be in the computer
[01:56:13.240 --> 01:56:19.800]   lab writing basic or in the 80s or 90s, essentially writing simple code, download the emulator. It's
[01:56:19.800 --> 01:56:25.320]   available for really every platform, including the Mac. There's also a lot of like, it's been around
[01:56:25.320 --> 01:56:30.120]   for about a year or a year and a half now, which means a lot of people have now uploaded like their
[01:56:30.120 --> 01:56:36.040]   own basic programs or similar language programs. So it's fun. I usually don't like nostalgia because
[01:56:36.040 --> 01:56:41.880]   it's like, I would rather people appreciate a Commodore 64 for what it is and what they like
[01:56:41.880 --> 01:56:47.480]   about it than remember the 80s. Remember Snap Bracelets? Remember Jelly Shoes and a computer
[01:56:47.480 --> 01:56:53.640]   on your desktop? Was a Commodore 64? It's like, no, let's not relive the 80s. Let's just enjoy
[01:56:53.640 --> 01:56:58.200]   this thing that we, you know, so it's a fun thing to do and it'll be free and you don't have to
[01:56:58.200 --> 01:57:02.440]   even spend $10 for a Raspberry Pi to make this sort of stuff happen. Although I have to say,
[01:57:02.440 --> 01:57:07.080]   if you can get a Raspberry Pi and I know they've been very hard to get, that's probably the right
[01:57:07.080 --> 01:57:12.040]   computer to get for a 12 year old these days, right? I would say so because I wouldn't necessarily
[01:57:12.040 --> 01:57:16.920]   want a 12 year old to learn basic. This is where I disagree with some of the print. There's a fact,
[01:57:16.920 --> 01:57:21.720]   a fact file that explains like the nature of the project and one of them is, oh, I think that
[01:57:21.720 --> 01:57:26.520]   every kid should learn how to program in a system like this. Like, no, if I had a kid,
[01:57:26.520 --> 01:57:31.240]   I would want them to learn modern programming techniques. I would want them to learn how to use
[01:57:31.240 --> 01:57:38.360]   APIs. I would want them to learn how to use StackFlow, how to use JScript, how to use all these other
[01:57:38.360 --> 01:57:46.280]   things. That's how apps are made. That's the root of nostalgia saying, oh, it was so great in the
[01:57:46.280 --> 01:57:53.000]   80s to program this way. But believe me, absolutely believe me. If I had the ability to create a
[01:57:53.000 --> 01:57:58.360]   menu system by simply saying, oh, by the way, just call this a piece, use this include file,
[01:57:58.360 --> 01:58:03.400]   and then call this API, I would have used the hell out of that instead of having to say, okay,
[01:58:03.400 --> 01:58:07.480]   well, it clearly, I can't just use peaks and pokes to create this. So I'm going to have to build
[01:58:07.480 --> 01:58:13.640]   this menu system in assembler, which is going to take me a long time. But I don't know when these
[01:58:13.640 --> 01:58:17.240]   Raspberry Pies will be back and stuck them at anative fruit. They're all out of stock,
[01:58:17.240 --> 01:58:22.680]   including the Pies Zero. And it's just, boy, I hope they can make some more. This is where the
[01:58:22.680 --> 01:58:27.400]   supply chain really hurts because this is exactly the right thing to get a smart 12-year-old.
[01:58:27.400 --> 01:58:32.840]   And just give it to them and say, go. Not only for that, but because all they have to do is goog,
[01:58:32.840 --> 01:58:38.040]   how do I do this, how do I turn on the light, how do I control an LCD? You Google that question,
[01:58:38.040 --> 01:58:44.440]   and you will find an embarrassment of tutorials. All you got to do is just be ready to spend a
[01:58:44.440 --> 01:58:50.200]   lot of money on native fruit. It's like, I really think the Raspberry Pies is a computer equivalent
[01:58:50.200 --> 01:58:57.960]   of 30 bucks. Give away the razor charge for the blades because, oh, if I want to have a window
[01:58:57.960 --> 01:59:04.920]   like LED panel that I'll have to buy this header for the, wow, how much is that? Only $90? Sure.
[01:59:06.760 --> 01:59:10.120]   I'm going to amend myself. For about 100 bucks, you get the kit that has a screen, a keyboard.
[01:59:10.120 --> 01:59:13.640]   You can get, you want to get at least enough so that the kit can start.
[01:59:13.640 --> 01:59:18.120]   That'd be about 100 bucks. The touchscreen's $15. That kind of thing.
[01:59:18.120 --> 01:59:23.560]   Yeah. Controlling servos is amazing. Oh, man. And then the GPIO bus, and you could just do,
[01:59:23.560 --> 01:59:29.080]   oh my God, it's incredible. No question. It's incredible. Renee Ritchie, pick of the week.
[01:59:30.520 --> 01:59:38.120]   So I included those that, well, this is the geekers, I believe. The geeker one. Yeah, he's got a
[01:59:38.120 --> 01:59:41.960]   Mandarin channel, which is much, he posts much more on there. He's got an English channel that he's
[01:59:41.960 --> 01:59:48.120]   started. He hasn't posted that much yet. If you can, can you put on English closed captions and then,
[01:59:48.120 --> 01:59:53.240]   I'm not sure. I don't know if he offers them or not, but you can look at like the English,
[01:59:53.240 --> 01:59:59.320]   he does a Snapdragon 8 series, one generation one, Gen 1. Yeah, so it does have auto translation
[01:59:59.320 --> 02:00:04.760]   into English. I don't know how good it is, but you do want to hear his voice, right?
[02:00:04.760 --> 02:00:10.040]   Because yeah, he's so good. He's got a great style to look at the title of the next video,
[02:00:10.040 --> 02:00:16.120]   the English video. I mean, he doesn't hold back. There's no artifice. Is he is he in mainland China?
[02:00:16.120 --> 02:00:23.000]   I believe so. Yeah, I think he's in Sanjian, but I'm not positive. Wow. It's just, he's obviously
[02:00:23.000 --> 02:00:28.840]   under the radar or is smart enough. You just have so much access. Like they have so much access.
[02:00:28.840 --> 02:00:32.520]   You don't like the companies don't don't really do anything for them. So they just give their
[02:00:32.520 --> 02:00:35.720]   straightforward honest opinions and they actually know how this stuff works. They're super smart.
[02:00:35.720 --> 02:00:39.720]   It's fantastic. Like a whole new culture. Yeah. Yeah. Really, really.
[02:00:39.720 --> 02:00:47.480]   Get them. GEECARWA. And then this is the English language version. Yes.
[02:00:47.480 --> 02:00:51.880]   And you can see by again, by his title, he has very little, very, very little hesitation.
[02:00:54.120 --> 02:00:59.960]   I won't say that lab, but yeah, it's a good time. He's not fond with the overall thermals of that
[02:00:59.960 --> 02:01:05.560]   chipset. Now here comes. He's not necessarily concerned with maintaining a good relationship
[02:01:05.560 --> 02:01:11.800]   with a PR apparatus behind that. That's what you need. Thank God. Isn't it sad that we have to go
[02:01:11.800 --> 02:01:16.360]   to one of the most repressive countries in the world where free speech is so free
[02:01:16.360 --> 02:01:22.920]   from our depression to be free from from commercial pressure. Wow. Yeah. Wow.
[02:01:22.920 --> 02:01:31.240]   Now comes. That sent me this big, this big, this big van trailer to stay in for two days. Like,
[02:01:31.240 --> 02:01:34.520]   why are they stupid to think that I would be impressed with this? What does this have to do
[02:01:34.520 --> 02:01:39.320]   with the super process? Oh, look, there's a cake with my face on it like I care.
[02:01:40.760 --> 02:01:47.880]   Andy, maybe you should start a jam. To me, I'm not, I'm not here to roast other YouTube,
[02:01:47.880 --> 02:01:52.840]   other YouTubers. And not until, not until I show this, this sort of work dedication and,
[02:01:52.840 --> 02:01:57.960]   and consistently that even like the ones that I would be the uncle Roger of tech. Yeah, exactly.
[02:01:57.960 --> 02:02:06.520]   We try to be nice, but honest, but I have to say, this is a sad moment on the show because we are
[02:02:06.520 --> 02:02:12.600]   going to take a little blow to the quality of the show because our dear friend Renee Richie,
[02:02:12.600 --> 02:02:19.320]   this is his last pick of the week and his last visit on a regular basis. And I do,
[02:02:19.320 --> 02:02:23.000]   I think we want to keep the door open that you might come back from time to time on break weekly.
[02:02:23.000 --> 02:02:29.560]   Yes, I would love that. And details on what's going on for Renee to follow.
[02:02:29.560 --> 02:02:33.880]   To follow. Yes, I can't say anything yet. Yeah. But we are.
[02:02:33.880 --> 02:02:41.000]   Renee, you have been, when did you start on Mac break weekly? Oh gosh, 2011, 2012, I'm not sure.
[02:02:41.000 --> 02:02:46.840]   It feels like you've always been here. I've been always watching. That's why I feel like I've
[02:02:46.840 --> 02:02:53.320]   never. I mean, no, I mean, and without you are our debunker in chief. You are the guy who,
[02:02:53.320 --> 02:03:00.280]   who has the inside knowledge, your honesty, your integrity, the quality of your content,
[02:03:00.280 --> 02:03:06.040]   and just the wonderful genial nature of your delivery makes you irreplaceable,
[02:03:06.040 --> 02:03:09.800]   totally irreplaceable. I'm not crying. I have allergies.
[02:03:09.800 --> 02:03:19.320]   It is a great loss to the show and I'm sorry to lose you. I just want to go. I think I can do a
[02:03:19.320 --> 02:03:23.640]   search. Oh, miss this terribly. Search for your name here, Renee Richie, and find out when you
[02:03:24.840 --> 02:03:31.080]   first appeared. Does the internet go back that long? I think though that what we do is when we say
[02:03:31.080 --> 02:03:37.880]   appearances, if you appearances, I think we can sort them chronologically, I'm thinking.
[02:03:37.880 --> 02:03:43.400]   So that's the most recent. Let's go to 35 pages of appearances. Oh, wow.
[02:03:43.400 --> 02:03:52.280]   And there's quite a few shows for appearance. That's again? 2013. Although I see you on the show
[02:03:53.080 --> 02:03:59.960]   here June 6th, 2012, June 26th, 2012. So interestingly, it's been almost exactly 10 years
[02:03:59.960 --> 02:04:07.640]   since your first appearance on the show. It feels like a minute, Leo. Time really does fly.
[02:04:07.640 --> 02:04:13.640]   It's a fast decade and I am just so sad to be losing you, but I'm sure it will be a happy
[02:04:13.640 --> 02:04:19.000]   occasion when we find out where you're going, unless it's like you're moving the Ecuador to
[02:04:19.000 --> 02:04:26.040]   raise llamas. No. No, no, no, no. I can't think of climate. Okay. I hope that's not the case.
[02:04:26.040 --> 02:04:30.440]   He's going to he's going to be vacationing in Patagonia, like the Red Pirate Robocks.
[02:04:30.440 --> 02:04:35.480]   We are going to. He's the he's new Minchi Quo.
[02:04:35.480 --> 02:04:42.440]   Back in all his shows will be in Chinese from now on. Suddenly, we're going to see pictures of
[02:04:42.440 --> 02:04:48.840]   birds nest. We don't know. It's a mystery. We do know who we're replacing him.
[02:04:49.080 --> 02:04:56.360]   But I'm going to keep that mystery for next Tuesday when that person will join our panel.
[02:04:56.360 --> 02:05:02.680]   It is not an easy thing. It is not an easy thing to do to replace Renee. In fact,
[02:05:02.680 --> 02:05:07.480]   we're not attempting to replace Renee, but there is an empty seat. So we'll we'll find somebody.
[02:05:07.480 --> 02:05:12.120]   Alex can see G.I. I mean, only even know that I'm gone. I mean, he's got the technology for years.
[02:05:12.120 --> 02:05:14.680]   He shows up anymore.
[02:05:16.600 --> 02:05:19.720]   I've been here for five years. Alex hasn't been here in three years.
[02:05:19.720 --> 02:05:25.080]   This is just an AI rendering. I wouldn't be surprised. Things like when there's a new doctor
[02:05:25.080 --> 02:05:32.520]   who that's not the same. You can't replace it. Someone will reinvent the character of person in
[02:05:32.520 --> 02:05:38.120]   the left mouth seat and make it their own. So junior, can I ask you what's going to happen to
[02:05:38.120 --> 02:05:44.040]   youtube.com/ReneeRitchie? Is that it's continuing? I'm going to keep the YouTube channel going. I
[02:05:44.040 --> 02:05:49.560]   am. I was previously thinking of changing it a little bit. As you've heard me say before,
[02:05:49.560 --> 02:05:53.880]   I'm kind of burned out on the leaked culture and I've gotten burned out on the benchmark. Gotcha,
[02:05:53.880 --> 02:05:57.480]   you know, product release schedule. So I was already thinking about changing it. I'm probably
[02:05:57.480 --> 02:06:01.800]   not going to have the time to do like four videos a week anymore. I'm definitely going to try to at
[02:06:01.800 --> 02:06:06.520]   least do one video, maybe a live stream every week. And I want to cover just bigger tech issues.
[02:06:06.520 --> 02:06:11.400]   I think that's going to be my next big YouTube attempt. Same channel, which channel.
[02:06:11.400 --> 02:06:16.120]   Bigger stories. And yeah, and you did say that we can from time to time bring you back. And I
[02:06:16.120 --> 02:06:20.600]   hope that's the case. Yes, I very much hope so. Yes. Because it's really going to leave a
[02:06:20.600 --> 02:06:25.720]   hole in the show and in my heart. Thank you. We're going to miss you. Same. Thank you Renee for
[02:06:25.720 --> 02:06:32.920]   10 years of just excellent contributions to the channel. Alex Lindsey is at officehours.global
[02:06:32.920 --> 02:06:39.880]   and is here in spirit as a robot. He I don't know how he has time to do all that. You can also
[02:06:39.880 --> 02:06:43.320]   find him at 090 media. What's coming up on officehours.global.
[02:06:43.320 --> 02:06:49.000]   Oh, I mean, it's it's always something. We're getting ready for. Yeah, we're getting
[02:06:49.000 --> 02:06:53.720]   ready for more coverage. So we've been doing coverage of a variety of different shows. And so
[02:06:53.720 --> 02:06:58.440]   we're talking about that a little bit as we move forward. And yeah, we're just, you know,
[02:06:58.440 --> 02:07:02.520]   where there's a lot today, we just did what we call ruthless reviews, which are really fun.
[02:07:02.520 --> 02:07:07.560]   You get to watch us like pick at each other. Oh my God. Check out your black levels and
[02:07:08.360 --> 02:07:12.840]   that little that blue over there. I'm not sure if I would use and there's like a lots of like if
[02:07:12.840 --> 02:07:18.360]   you want to see people really get particular about framing, you know, and how it's set up,
[02:07:18.360 --> 02:07:21.560]   we really push it pretty hard because we're getting ready to move office hours to.
[02:07:21.560 --> 02:07:27.160]   We're just in the process over the summer of moving into 4K HDR 5.1. So,
[02:07:27.160 --> 02:07:33.000]   so, you know, just as a yeah. So I want to see this one focus on working in the White House.
[02:07:33.640 --> 02:07:39.880]   Somebody I think has some insight info on that one. Yeah. Yeah. I got a couple photos laying around.
[02:07:39.880 --> 02:07:43.880]   There's Fred. Oh, I want to see that one. Fred. Fred. Good Johnson is in the over. Is he in the
[02:07:43.880 --> 02:07:48.440]   over? No, in that case, he's actually in their shot. I have pictures of him in the
[02:07:48.440 --> 02:07:55.160]   oval, but no, not an oval, but in in the Roosevelt room. But the the funny thing is, is that so
[02:07:55.160 --> 02:08:00.440]   for when we were doing work in the White House, which I couldn't talk about while I was here.
[02:08:00.440 --> 02:08:07.000]   Oh, the you know, obviously we did it with the Obama administration. And the funny thing is,
[02:08:07.000 --> 02:08:12.280]   is that Frederick happens to be the same height, roughly a similar complexion, and can really
[02:08:12.280 --> 02:08:18.520]   answer politics really well. He's still here. We called him our Fopo, our Fopotas, our Fopo.
[02:08:18.520 --> 02:08:23.400]   Oh, he's like, oh, he's the Fopo. And so, so, so I talked a little bit about some of those things
[02:08:23.400 --> 02:08:28.600]   in that in that episode. It was a lot of fun. I think after 10 years, I could, yeah,
[02:08:28.600 --> 02:08:33.800]   I think it's safe now. There's the Roosevelt room and there's your setup. Look at this.
[02:08:33.800 --> 02:08:38.520]   This is this is wonderful. I want to see this. Yeah, that's an EOB. Yeah. Oh, that's an
[02:08:38.520 --> 02:08:44.680]   executive feeling. Okay. Yeah. Very cool. So, but yeah. So, but yeah, the, but I talked a little
[02:08:44.680 --> 02:08:52.520]   bit about what it takes to do that. Wow. Really cool. And I don't go GBH. When?
[02:08:53.880 --> 02:08:59.560]   Friday at 1245 at the Boston Public Library Studio, I intend fully to be there unless I miss my
[02:08:59.560 --> 02:09:04.840]   early train, in which case I will be here dressed as much as I am right. And you're not,
[02:09:04.840 --> 02:09:09.560]   neither of you are quitting anytime soon, right? You're going to stay here. Oh, believe me. I
[02:09:09.560 --> 02:09:17.400]   need this excuse to be awake as early as 2pm on a Tuesday. You aren't always, but I'm not going
[02:09:17.400 --> 02:09:24.680]   to bring that up. Renee, Richie, but honestly, how much sharper and more well informed was I
[02:09:24.680 --> 02:09:30.520]   after I had to do it. A little nap. A little nap does not hurt. Does not hurt. Alex Lindsey's
[02:09:30.520 --> 02:09:36.840]   asked me anything is coming up July 14th in our club. I can't wait. That's one of many things we do
[02:09:36.840 --> 02:09:41.720]   in the club. Club to it is $7 a month gets you ad free versions of all of our shows,
[02:09:42.680 --> 02:09:48.040]   gets you access to the club to it discord, which is always a wonderful community full of great
[02:09:48.040 --> 02:09:53.960]   times. And maybe we can get Renee Richie to stop by once in a while in the club to it. Oh, I'll be
[02:09:53.960 --> 02:09:58.840]   checking in. Yeah, that would be nice. Also the Twitter plus feed with stuff you don't see on the
[02:09:58.840 --> 02:10:04.840]   shows for $7 a month. And soon we'll be announcing the purchase of the Superman building. So that's
[02:10:04.840 --> 02:10:15.320]   going to be a big, exactly. Get it now. Get it now. Twit.tv/club to it again, Renee, you will be
[02:10:15.320 --> 02:10:20.440]   sorely missed. Thank you so much. You're the greatest. And I'm I've been meaning to come up to
[02:10:20.440 --> 02:10:26.680]   Montreal. Now I have to just to get my fix my Renee Richie fix. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. We will hit all
[02:10:26.680 --> 02:10:33.080]   the best spots. It'll be a nice. And Godspeed. I know you're doing something you really want to do.
[02:10:33.640 --> 02:10:38.120]   And thank you so much. Tales. Well, I don't know what it is, but I'm sure it's good. I'll let you
[02:10:38.120 --> 02:10:44.680]   know as soon as I can. Details to emerge later. Our our loss is the mixed martial arts square
[02:10:44.680 --> 02:10:49.560]   circles game. Well, I said, I'm a know what you did not deny saying I think Prime Minister Trudeau
[02:10:49.560 --> 02:10:54.600]   is going to really appreciate having somebody who knows tech at his right hand. But you didn't say
[02:10:54.600 --> 02:10:59.080]   anything. So I'm thinking maybe when I pop up on Windows weekly and that would be hysterical.
[02:10:59.880 --> 02:11:04.600]   See on the cruise. I don't think I don't think Conor McGregor knows what's coming.
[02:11:04.600 --> 02:11:13.000]   Oh my God. Yeah. Hey, baby. Yeah. We do Mac break weekly every Tuesday soon to be Renee.
[02:11:13.000 --> 02:11:21.560]   List right around 11 a.m. Pacific 2 p.m. Eastern time 1800 UTC. You can watch us live at live.tv.
[02:11:21.560 --> 02:11:26.760]   There's also a live audio stream there. Chat with us live at irc.twit.tv or if you're a member
[02:11:26.760 --> 02:11:32.040]   of the club in the club Twit Discord, you can get all the shows after the fact on the website
[02:11:32.040 --> 02:11:39.560]   twit.tv/mbw or on the YouTube channel dedicated to Mac break weekly or and I think this is probably
[02:11:39.560 --> 02:11:44.440]   the best and easiest thing to do. Subscribe in your favorite podcast player that way you'll get it
[02:11:44.440 --> 02:11:50.920]   automatically the minute it's available. We want to welcome John Ashley, our new technical director.
[02:11:50.920 --> 02:11:55.640]   He's been editing the show for some time. We're putting him up on the big board, which means
[02:11:55.640 --> 02:11:59.800]   John Jammerby gets to sit in the producer's seat. He gets to relax a little bit.
[02:11:59.800 --> 02:12:03.880]   Glaring at me. I think I think I think I think I think Mr. Ashley's had a little bit of live
[02:12:03.880 --> 02:12:07.000]   experience. John, it's not a live experience. I don't know what you're talking about. I don't
[02:12:07.000 --> 02:12:12.920]   know what you're talking about. Anyway, so as they say one door opens and another door closes or is
[02:12:12.920 --> 02:12:16.120]   it the other way around? But anyway, welcome, John. It's great to have you. John's been here with
[02:12:16.120 --> 02:12:21.160]   us for a long time. But now I think now that before that he was with me. No, I know.
[02:12:21.160 --> 02:12:31.160]   We have a number of former pixel corgars in our ranks. Thank you, everybody. We'll see you soon.
[02:12:31.160 --> 02:12:39.160]   At least I hope so. Meanwhile, back to work because break time is over so long.
[02:12:39.160 --> 02:12:45.640]   If you are looking for a midweek update on the week's tech news, I got to tell you, you've got
[02:12:45.640 --> 02:12:50.600]   to check out tech news weekly. See, it's all kind of built in there with the title. You get to learn
[02:12:50.600 --> 02:12:56.440]   about the news in tech that matters. Every Thursday, Jason Howell and I talk to the people making and
[02:12:56.440 --> 02:13:01.960]   breaking the tech news, get their insights and their interesting stories. It's a great show to
[02:13:01.960 --> 02:13:04.840]   check out twit.tv/tnw.
