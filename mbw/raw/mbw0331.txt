[00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:58.520]   Hello, everybody, and welcome to a very special Christmas
[00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:02.120]   Day episode of Mac Break Weekly.
[00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:05.480]   Me, I'm your host, Leo LaPorte, the Pat Boone
[00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:07.280]   of Macintosh Podcast.
[00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:10.000]   Actually, today's episode is not what you think it is.
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.360]   It's going to be a best of Mac Break Weekly.
[00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.160]   The biggest story, the most interesting story,
[00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:19.440]   is the biggest guffaws of 2012 with Andy, Alex, Renee Ritchie,
[00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:21.680]   and more.
[00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:23.960]   And I want to get right into it.
[00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:26.280]   But before we do, I'd also like to mention our friends
[00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.160]   at Ford, because they've been a big highlight for all of us
[00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:31.200]   here at Twit all year long.
[00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:32.400]   We are just big fans.
[00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:33.680]   I love my Ford Mustang.
[00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:35.400]   I got that two years ago now.
[00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.920]   And Ford first started advertising on the network.
[00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:42.200]   And I've loved driving it around, but I have to say,
[00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:46.760]   2013 is going to bring a little change for me and my Ford,
[00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:52.560]   because I'm trading the Mustang in for the 2013 Ford Fusion.
[00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:53.560]   I'm so excited.
[00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:56.280]   And one of the reasons I want it is some of the new technologies
[00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.040]   they're building into both the 2013 Fusion.
[00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:02.240]   And it's also available on the 2013 Ford Tourist,
[00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:04.880]   like the Blind Spot Information System.
[00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:07.920]   They call it Bliss, BLIS.
[00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.600]   This is an amazing technology.
[00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:14.200]   They've put sensors into the rear panels of the vehicles.
[00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:17.800]   And it watches traffic behind you.
[00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:20.600]   And what happens is if traffic gets into your blind spot,
[00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:24.160]   you know that area that you can't see with the mirrors.
[00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:26.960]   And it can be a real problem, because it's
[00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:28.480]   one of the biggest causes for accidents.
[00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:30.240]   People pulling into a lane where there's a car there.
[00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:31.600]   They just didn't see it.
[00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:33.840]   This Blind Spot Information System
[00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:36.760]   puts an audible and visual signal right
[00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:39.320]   on the rear view mirror saying, hey,
[00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:40.760]   there's somebody in your blind spot.
[00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:42.880]   Don't merge.
[00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:44.600]   That's a lifesaver.
[00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:46.440]   Really incredible stuff.
[00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:48.880]   They also-- those same sensors can do another thing
[00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:49.520]   that I love.
[00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:52.160]   I've actually had an accident in a parking lot.
[00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:53.840]   It's probably the worst accident I ever had.
[00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:55.120]   The car was total.
[00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:56.000]   I just finished.
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.320]   It wasn't a Ford.
[00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:00.840]   I had just finished getting the car done.
[00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:01.960]   I think it was 1,500 bucks.
[00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:04.480]   I had a bunch of stuff worked on the car.
[00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:06.920]   And I was very slowly, cautiously, and intelligently
[00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:08.120]   driving it out.
[00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:10.160]   When an employee of the car dealer
[00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:12.840]   whips out from a parking space right in front of me,
[00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:14.640]   I didn't have time to stop total the car.
[00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:15.920]   I wasn't hurt nor was the guy.
[00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:19.080]   Two cars destroyed.
[00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:21.200]   And all because he couldn't see-- there
[00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:23.160]   was a big truck in between me and him.
[00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:25.920]   He couldn't see me coming down that narrow aisle.
[00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:27.400]   This would have avoided that.
[00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:28.920]   The Blind Spot Information System
[00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:30.320]   gives you a cross-traffic alert.
[00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:33.480]   So as you're backing out of a parking spot,
[00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:37.600]   you can see-- you can't see it, but the blind spot stuff
[00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:39.880]   can see around the corner and tell you
[00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:42.260]   if there's another vehicle coming so you can stop, wait till it
[00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:44.440]   goes by, and then continue out.
[00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:46.480]   I wish he'd had that.
[00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:47.440]   Maybe not.
[00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:51.640]   I'd probably still be driving that old Geo--
[00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:53.880]   the Geo Prism.
[00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:55.480]   I like my Mustang a whole lot better,
[00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:57.480]   and I can't wait to get my Ford Fusion.
[00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:58.920]   They also have active park assist.
[00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:01.560]   And this I actually need.
[00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:04.280]   It's getting harder and harder for me
[00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:08.280]   with my limited mobility and poor eyesight to parallel park.
[00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:10.120]   Actually, I've never been a good parallel parker.
[00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:12.000]   You know that thing where you pull forward,
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:13.280]   then you pull back just far enough
[00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:15.480]   that you see the back of the car, and then you turn the wheel
[00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:17.120]   hard, and I always think I'm going to hit the car.
[00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:19.120]   I'm going to hit the car so I back off,
[00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:21.560]   and I turn it the other way, and then I don't get it in.
[00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:23.720]   And then it kind of-- I parked, but I'm four feet
[00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:26.440]   from the curb, or maybe I just hate that.
[00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:28.880]   Or worse, you're searching for a parking spot.
[00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:31.120]   So you think you found one, and there's no--
[00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:33.160]   it's just too small.
[00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:34.880]   You can't get in it.
[00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:37.000]   No matter how good you are at parallel parking-- so active
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:38.880]   park assist is very cool.
[00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:41.880]   I used this when we were in Detroit last year.
[00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:43.560]   Wow, was this cool.
[00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:45.440]   The active park assist-- you press the button,
[00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:47.160]   you say, I'm looking for a parking space.
[00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:50.880]   And as you drive, the car is scanning the parking spaces.
[00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:53.200]   As soon as you see one that's big enough--
[00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:56.280]   and it can be just big enough, because it's very good at this--
[00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:57.840]   it says, all right, got it, pull forward.
[00:04:57.840 --> 00:04:59.520]   You pull forward, you take your hands off the wheel,
[00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:01.880]   you keep your foot on the accelerator and the brake,
[00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:03.480]   because you don't want to lose control of the vehicle.
[00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:04.680]   You're responsible for that.
[00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:06.720]   This was the lesson I didn't learn.
[00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:09.200]   And it's so wild, because the car pulls forward.
[00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:11.920]   That's what you're supposed to do exactly the right distance.
[00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:13.960]   Goes, the wheel turns.
[00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:16.440]   And in 24 seconds, you're parallel parked,
[00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:18.560]   better than you could ever do it yourself.
[00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:20.360]   It's kind of amazing.
[00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:23.560]   I want you to try this, both bliss with cross traffic alert
[00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:25.880]   and active park assist are available now.
[00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:29.000]   In the 2013 Ford Fusion and 2013 Ford Tourist,
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:30.760]   you better believe I'm getting in that new Fusion.
[00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:31.920]   I need it.
[00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:36.040]   And you can find out more at Ford.com/technology.
[00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:38.480]   I invite you to visit them today.
[00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:40.800]   All right, that's the only ad we're going to do today.
[00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:41.760]   I wanted to get it out of the way,
[00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:44.960]   because we've just lined up a bunch of really great bits.
[00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:49.680]   Here for your delectation, about an hour and a half
[00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:53.440]   of the best stuff from Mac Brake Weekly 2012.
[00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:53.960]   Enjoy.
[00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:56.960]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:05:56.960 --> 00:06:01.320]   It's time for Mac Brake Weekly, the show
[00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:02.840]   that covers the latest Apple news.
[00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:07.560]   In this case, live from CES 2012, where there is no Apple news.
[00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:10.240]   Somebody made a very big mistake here.
[00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:10.800]   Good news.
[00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:11.880]   We've got a great panel.
[00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:14.040]   I'm going to start all the way to the left with Leander Connie
[00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:16.680]   from cultofmac.com.
[00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:18.320]   Leander, great to see you.
[00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:20.320]   Why do you come to CES?
[00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:21.840]   There's no Apple news here.
[00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:22.800]   Oh, I beg to differ.
[00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:26.000]   Apple's not here, but everybody else has got Apple products.
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:26.720]   All right.
[00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:28.760]   We'll talk about it in just a second.
[00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:31.080]   Alex Lindsey has actually brought some products.
[00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:32.600]   They've got some fun stuff to play with,
[00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:34.400]   including a Thunderbolt drive.
[00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:35.280]   I like drives.
[00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:37.520]   Alex Lindsey from pixelcore.com and pixelcore.tv.
[00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:41.960]   Sarah Lane is also here from iPad Today and Tech News Today.
[00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:42.680]   Hi, Sarah.
[00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:43.320]   Hi, Leo.
[00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:45.160]   We're going to do iPad Today here--
[00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:46.160]   On Thursday.
[00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:48.200]   We're going to walk the eye lounge.
[00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:51.160]   28,000 square feet of iPod cases.
[00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:53.160]   Dad, I'll look bigger than last year.
[00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:53.680]   That's huge.
[00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:55.480]   But there's more than just iPod cases.
[00:06:55.480 --> 00:06:56.120]   Thank goodness.
[00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:57.240]   I hope so.
[00:06:57.240 --> 00:06:59.160]   Also here from cultofmac, Erfan Elijah.
[00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:00.160]   It's good to see you, Erfan.
[00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:00.920]   Nice to see you again.
[00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:02.360]   I don't know if you've been on the show before,
[00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:03.760]   but have we met in person, I don't think.
[00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:04.880]   We have met in person.
[00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:07.280]   We dance together out South by Southwest.
[00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:08.080]   I got photos of it.
[00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:09.080]   That was so much fun.
[00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:09.600]   Yeah.
[00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:11.440]   Apparently, I didn't do a good job.
[00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:11.960]   Yeah.
[00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:12.840]   I think you were a little--
[00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:13.800]   We danced together?
[00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:14.320]   Yeah.
[00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:15.560]   We actually went like this.
[00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:16.560]   Dun, dun, dun, dun.
[00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:17.560]   Really?
[00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:17.560]   Yeah.
[00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:18.560]   I have pictures of it.
[00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:19.560]   I'd love to send those to you.
[00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:20.560]   Please, yeah.
[00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:21.400]   Just put them off on your--
[00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:22.400]   Send them to Sarah.
[00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:23.400]   She'll use them.
[00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:24.400]   Public Flickr set, please.
[00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:25.400]   OK, I'll do that.
[00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:26.400]   So we can all enjoy them.
[00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:29.760]   So Leander, why is this a good show for an Apple blog like Cultofmac?
[00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:32.680]   Although, by the way, you're branching out with Cultofmac.
[00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:33.680]   Right.
[00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:34.680]   Yeah, people--
[00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:35.680]   Baby.
[00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:36.680]   Right.
[00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:37.680]   Android now, too.
[00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:38.680]   Cultof Android.
[00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:39.680]   Right.
[00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:41.840]   Are you going to shave Android into the back of your head?
[00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:42.840]   Put a little robot?
[00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:43.840]   Unfortunately, I don't have enough hands.
[00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:44.840]   Too late, huh?
[00:07:44.840 --> 00:07:45.840]   Too late now.
[00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:47.720]   Maybe I'll stick it on.
[00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:52.880]   Do the Apple fanboys say, oh, you've-- you're a pasty now?
[00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:57.600]   Yeah, you know, we are running a risk of alienating.
[00:07:57.600 --> 00:07:59.400]   I hate to say a small part of our audience.
[00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:02.320]   It's probably a big part of our audience with doing this.
[00:08:02.320 --> 00:08:03.880]   But, you know, we've been getting these debates.
[00:08:03.880 --> 00:08:10.280]   Every time we talked about Android in a news story, there would be-- we'd get a lot of
[00:08:10.280 --> 00:08:14.560]  -- we get a lot of Android fans coming in and debating this stuff on Cultofmac.
[00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:15.720]   So it made total sense.
[00:08:15.720 --> 00:08:19.320]   It was just like the old days of the Windows versus Mac, PC walls.
[00:08:19.320 --> 00:08:20.920]   It is exactly like that.
[00:08:20.920 --> 00:08:22.160]   For anybody who lived through that.
[00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:23.160]   Right.
[00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:24.160]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:25.160]   It's Redux.
[00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:26.160]   It's exactly the same stuff again.
[00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:27.160]   And it's a very, very--
[00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:28.160]   Even down a market share and all of this stuff.
[00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:29.160]   Right.
[00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:30.800]   Well, Apple has huge market share right now.
[00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:33.800]   But at some point, I think Android is going to become the Windows.
[00:08:33.800 --> 00:08:34.800]   Yeah.
[00:08:34.800 --> 00:08:37.120]   And they did about the same sort of stuff, you know, like availability of software, which
[00:08:37.120 --> 00:08:40.120]   one's about a platform, which one does this, but I which one does that.
[00:08:40.120 --> 00:08:41.120]   Which one's the shoe or--
[00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:42.120]   Yeah.
[00:08:42.120 --> 00:08:43.120]   Yeah.
[00:08:43.120 --> 00:08:44.120]   Yeah.
[00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:45.120]   Cool.
[00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:46.120]   Is that CultofAndroid.com?
[00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:47.120]   CultofAndroid.com.
[00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:48.120]   Well done.
[00:08:48.120 --> 00:08:49.120]   I think that's a good-- I think that's great.
[00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:50.120]   And I know Mike-- Mike Elgin is writing for you.
[00:08:50.120 --> 00:08:52.440]   In fact, he has the article why Apple will dominate CES.
[00:08:52.440 --> 00:08:56.760]   And it has been true every year of the last-- since the iPhone came out, since 2007.
[00:08:56.760 --> 00:08:57.760]   Yeah.
[00:08:57.760 --> 00:09:00.520]   Last year, everybody was talking about iPad 2, the year before iPad, the year before the
[00:09:00.520 --> 00:09:01.520]   iPhone.
[00:09:01.520 --> 00:09:04.200]   I think this is the first year that it doesn't dominate.
[00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:05.200]   Now, it's early days.
[00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:07.560]   We've been-- the show's been going on for two and a half hours.
[00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:08.880]   So it might be too early to tell.
[00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:12.640]   But I see a lot of Microsoft, a lot of Windows phone, a lot of Android.
[00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:13.640]   True.
[00:09:13.640 --> 00:09:14.640]   True enough, exactly.
[00:09:14.640 --> 00:09:15.640]   I know Microsoft has really come back this year.
[00:09:15.640 --> 00:09:16.640]   It's ironic.
[00:09:16.640 --> 00:09:17.640]   This is their year.
[00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:18.640]   Yeah.
[00:09:18.640 --> 00:09:19.640]   They're last year.
[00:09:19.640 --> 00:09:20.640]   Yeah.
[00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:21.640]   Yeah.
[00:09:21.640 --> 00:09:22.640]   Going out with a bang.
[00:09:22.640 --> 00:09:23.640]   Yeah.
[00:09:23.640 --> 00:09:24.640]   Very interesting.
[00:09:24.640 --> 00:09:25.880]   I think that I think that the while Apple's not here and while you're not seeing a lot of
[00:09:25.880 --> 00:09:29.760]   the new Apple products, the one thing you-- almost every person, almost every article
[00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:33.960]   that I've seen, every time they talk about anything being added to the TV, they say,
[00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:35.480]   but we're not sure how this will compare to the ITV.
[00:09:35.480 --> 00:09:36.480]   Apple isn't even here.
[00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:37.480]   They haven't even announced it.
[00:09:37.480 --> 00:09:39.240]   There is no ITV, but it does--
[00:09:39.240 --> 00:09:44.280]   But every TV is going up against this mythical beast that--
[00:09:44.280 --> 00:09:45.280]   Right.
[00:09:45.280 --> 00:09:48.680]   --this unicorn that-- but we've seen this unicorn so many times now.
[00:09:48.680 --> 00:09:51.400]   We've seen it, oh, they're never going to build a phone, oh, they're never going to do
[00:09:51.400 --> 00:09:55.040]   an iPad, oh, they're never going to-- and so you hear this and then it just starts to
[00:09:55.040 --> 00:09:56.840]   keep on picking up speed.
[00:09:56.840 --> 00:09:59.520]   And it seems like a lot of-- when we're talking about--
[00:09:59.520 --> 00:10:02.000]   You're saying it feels like the drum beat for the iPad and the iPhone.
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:03.000]   Well, I'm just like pre-release.
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:10.200]   It feels like it's a CES pre-release where you have manufacturers that are very concerned
[00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:14.040]   about how whatever Apple's going to do is going to affect their business.
[00:10:14.040 --> 00:10:18.080]   They're trying to figure out ways to add interactivity, ways to add Google TV, ways to
[00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:20.880]   add other-- their own tools, their connected PC.
[00:10:20.880 --> 00:10:24.880]   Well, I mean, they should be doing that anyway, whether an author is ever an ITV coming down
[00:10:24.880 --> 00:10:28.200]   the pipe, and there's probably not going to be one this year.
[00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:31.520]   It's just-- I think it makes for a good article half the time.
[00:10:31.520 --> 00:10:32.520]   Yeah.
[00:10:32.520 --> 00:10:35.600]   Yeah, I just find it interesting how often you see it getting-- getting brought out.
[00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:42.920]   Irfan, have you seen the-- that LG 55-inch OLED 4-millimeter thick display?
[00:10:42.920 --> 00:10:43.920]   I have not.
[00:10:43.920 --> 00:10:44.920]   You haven't?
[00:10:44.920 --> 00:10:45.920]   It is on the show floor.
[00:10:45.920 --> 00:10:46.920]   It's working.
[00:10:46.920 --> 00:10:47.920]   In a dark cave writing days.
[00:10:47.920 --> 00:10:50.720]   We're going to get-- you writers, you-- I know Sarah saw it because it was at that event
[00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:52.720]   that I wasn't allowed into last night.
[00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:55.720]   I said it was a good little experience.
[00:10:55.720 --> 00:10:57.360]   I wasn't going to say the name, but yeah.
[00:10:57.360 --> 00:10:58.880]   So-- and I saw it as we walked in the show floor.
[00:10:58.880 --> 00:11:02.000]   We took a look at it actually on our live feed.
[00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:06.720]   The rumor is-- and I'd love for the Kultimac guys because I know you hear all the rumors--
[00:11:06.720 --> 00:11:12.160]   that since LG already makes Apple's panels, maybe this, which is not LG television but
[00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:17.440]   LG's panel division, maybe this is intended for an Apple TV.
[00:11:17.440 --> 00:11:18.440]   Sounds plausible.
[00:11:18.440 --> 00:11:19.440]   Does it?
[00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:20.440]   Sounds sensible.
[00:11:20.440 --> 00:11:26.080]   But the only issue, of course, is because could Apple get away with the charging $5 to $8,000
[00:11:26.080 --> 00:11:27.080]   for an Apple TV?
[00:11:27.080 --> 00:11:28.080]   Oh, gosh.
[00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:29.080]   Yeah, easily.
[00:11:29.080 --> 00:11:30.080]   But you think so?
[00:11:30.080 --> 00:11:31.080]   I do not.
[00:11:31.080 --> 00:11:32.080]   Well, initially--
[00:11:32.080 --> 00:11:35.600]   Especially since LCDs are now down below $1,000 at that size.
[00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:36.600]   Yeah.
[00:11:36.600 --> 00:11:39.200]   By the way, LG was not at the digital experience last night.
[00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:41.600]   I thought that the Samsungs was.
[00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:42.600]   The Samsungs was.
[00:11:42.600 --> 00:11:44.600]   It wasn't the-- they didn't have the OLED.
[00:11:44.600 --> 00:11:46.360]   I wouldn't have missed anything.
[00:11:46.360 --> 00:11:49.320]   Well, these guys have huge over-capacity panels, right?
[00:11:49.320 --> 00:11:50.920]   So they're dirt, dirt cheap.
[00:11:50.920 --> 00:11:53.880]   And they're dying to find a way to get rid of them to shift them.
[00:11:53.880 --> 00:11:54.880]   That's right.
[00:11:54.880 --> 00:11:59.960]   The trouble is, I think, when you think about Apple is that they come out with a new iPhone
[00:11:59.960 --> 00:12:00.960]   every year.
[00:12:00.960 --> 00:12:02.840]   They have a new iPad every year.
[00:12:02.840 --> 00:12:06.240]   They're in the hardware business and they're in the hardware upgrade business.
[00:12:06.240 --> 00:12:08.160]   Every year they have something better.
[00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:09.560]   And how are they going to do that in the TV business?
[00:12:09.560 --> 00:12:12.440]   I think that's going to be difficult for them to figure out how exactly do they get
[00:12:12.440 --> 00:12:18.800]   people to upgrade the hardware if they're going to use their traditional hardware business
[00:12:18.800 --> 00:12:19.800]   model.
[00:12:19.800 --> 00:12:25.200]   It is true that the Apple community is willing to pay higher prices for their key.
[00:12:25.200 --> 00:12:26.200]   We are.
[00:12:26.200 --> 00:12:29.560]   But look at true, but 10,000, 8,000, 5,000 for TV.
[00:12:29.560 --> 00:12:32.400]   I would be very surprised if we saw anything more than two or three thousand.
[00:12:32.400 --> 00:12:33.400]   I totally agree.
[00:12:33.400 --> 00:12:35.200]   It has to be a consumer product.
[00:12:35.200 --> 00:12:36.200]   Yeah.
[00:12:36.200 --> 00:12:38.200]   They won't necessarily charge a premium because look at the iPad.
[00:12:38.200 --> 00:12:41.800]   The iPad is actually probably, you know, was a really good deal when it came out.
[00:12:41.800 --> 00:12:42.800]   It was really shocking for me.
[00:12:42.800 --> 00:12:43.800]   Isn't that interesting?
[00:12:43.800 --> 00:12:47.400]   But they work-- and even though Steve Jobs said we are not competing against netbooks,
[00:12:47.400 --> 00:12:52.720]   they really were competing against the low end, low priced computer hardware.
[00:12:52.720 --> 00:12:54.080]   And that's true in TV right now.
[00:12:54.080 --> 00:12:57.760]   I mean, it's been such a bad year for HDTV manufacturers.
[00:12:57.760 --> 00:13:02.440]   They've been dumping their panels, as I said, for less than a thousand bucks for a 55 inch
[00:13:02.440 --> 00:13:03.440]   display.
[00:13:03.440 --> 00:13:06.400]   And I think that I think people, if Apple decided to go down that path, I think that
[00:13:06.400 --> 00:13:08.440]   what they are going to bring is more applications.
[00:13:08.440 --> 00:13:09.920]   They're not going to just bring video.
[00:13:09.920 --> 00:13:13.480]   I think what you have people that are tired of the viruses of their little PCs and they're
[00:13:13.480 --> 00:13:16.640]   tired of, you know, or they don't want to buy it, you know, they realize all I'm using
[00:13:16.640 --> 00:13:18.320]   for is web surfing and email.
[00:13:18.320 --> 00:13:20.800]   And I just want to incorporate that with my TV and not think about it anymore.
[00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:24.480]   So I think the sale point, if Apple decided to go down that path, is that this isn't a
[00:13:24.480 --> 00:13:25.480]   TV.
[00:13:25.480 --> 00:13:26.480]   This is how you communicate.
[00:13:26.480 --> 00:13:30.720]   This is how you do all that other stuff along with your TV, you know, in that experience.
[00:13:30.720 --> 00:13:31.720]   I totally agree.
[00:13:31.720 --> 00:13:34.560]   One of the things that Steve Jobs had said before was the problem was getting people
[00:13:34.560 --> 00:13:35.560]   to buy this hardware, right?
[00:13:35.560 --> 00:13:37.920]   Because they already had T-vos, they were getting stuff from dish, right?
[00:13:37.920 --> 00:13:39.320]   They didn't need to buy it anymore hardware.
[00:13:39.320 --> 00:13:42.800]   So if it comes built into the TV, it's like then all of a sudden people are like, "Oh,
[00:13:42.800 --> 00:13:43.800]   Apple has a TV.
[00:13:43.800 --> 00:13:47.440]   It comes with all this extra functionality that I would have had to buy an Apple TV or
[00:13:47.440 --> 00:13:49.040]   some other device to get."
[00:13:49.040 --> 00:13:50.040]   So for me, it's like a natural choice.
[00:13:50.040 --> 00:13:55.120]   And if they make it similar close to like a nice high-end TV, for me it'd be a no-brainer.
[00:13:55.120 --> 00:13:56.120]   Yeah.
[00:13:56.120 --> 00:14:00.520]   I mean, I think that that the, and there's ways they could make components that are interchangeable.
[00:14:00.520 --> 00:14:01.520]   I know it's not exactly Apple.
[00:14:01.520 --> 00:14:04.000]   It's something that can pop in and pop out so they can change the range.
[00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.600]   Well, see, that's why I wonder why you even bother with a panel.
[00:14:06.600 --> 00:14:10.240]   You've got an Apple TV that can do all those things.
[00:14:10.240 --> 00:14:17.000]   No, I have to say Apple is felt here in kind of in a non-explicit way because every TV
[00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:20.760]   manufacturer is showing TVs with built-in apps at the show.
[00:14:20.760 --> 00:14:21.760]   Yeah, smart.
[00:14:21.760 --> 00:14:22.760]   It's still really, really hard to use.
[00:14:22.760 --> 00:14:23.760]   These smart TVs.
[00:14:23.760 --> 00:14:24.760]   I don't know.
[00:14:24.760 --> 00:14:25.760]   I was looking at the LG.
[00:14:25.760 --> 00:14:29.200]   I only went by Curse Early, but in fact we showed everybody, if you watched our live
[00:14:29.200 --> 00:14:34.840]   stream at the beginning of the day, the LG TV with Google TV, was it LG?
[00:14:34.840 --> 00:14:37.680]   Yeah, with Google TV built-in.
[00:14:37.680 --> 00:14:39.400]   It was an ice cream sandwich.
[00:14:39.400 --> 00:14:43.240]   They had a remote that I thought was decent, but then they also were showing you phone and
[00:14:43.240 --> 00:14:45.240]   tablet interface.
[00:14:45.240 --> 00:14:46.240]   Android, not iPhone.
[00:14:46.240 --> 00:14:47.240]   Well, not makes sense.
[00:14:47.240 --> 00:14:51.920]   And I thought that it was actually pretty clear, pretty easy to use.
[00:14:51.920 --> 00:14:54.880]   Certainly no worse than an Apple TV with big icons.
[00:14:54.880 --> 00:14:59.520]   Alex, why do you think that so many apps are so hard to use in a TV interface now?
[00:14:59.520 --> 00:15:03.000]   Because you don't, I mean, going through it with the remote control, you know, do that
[00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:04.400]   little whatever that they want you to do.
[00:15:04.400 --> 00:15:07.720]   You know what, now it does make sense exactly with the Google TV integration with an Android
[00:15:07.720 --> 00:15:10.960]   phone or whatever, if you have an Android phone, that totally makes sense.
[00:15:10.960 --> 00:15:15.800]   But I think that integrating our lifestyle with our little portable, whatever that is,
[00:15:15.800 --> 00:15:20.200]   our iPad or Android, you know, that makes it easier.
[00:15:20.200 --> 00:15:22.560]   That makes it like, because I don't lose this very often.
[00:15:22.560 --> 00:15:26.200]   I lose the, we lose, my family loses the controller once a day.
[00:15:26.200 --> 00:15:29.560]   Like once a day, we can't figure out how to get to the Apple TV or back away from the
[00:15:29.560 --> 00:15:30.560]   Apple TV.
[00:15:30.560 --> 00:15:31.560]   That's why I need gesture-based.
[00:15:31.560 --> 00:15:33.720]   Well, and the thing is, I think those are good.
[00:15:33.720 --> 00:15:36.960]   But again, I think that the big thing here, and I think that TV manufacturers want to
[00:15:36.960 --> 00:15:41.040]   stay the dumb panel, but the issue is, is that I think that when I look at the way my
[00:15:41.040 --> 00:15:46.200]   kids and the way my parents use their computers, they don't need anything more than a fully
[00:15:46.200 --> 00:15:50.240]   operational iOS on their TV.
[00:15:50.240 --> 00:15:54.960]   And I still think that there is a big argument, the Apple TV is fine, but I think that there
[00:15:54.960 --> 00:16:00.040]   is a big argument for a camera that's going to do, it's going to do connect kind of, you
[00:16:00.040 --> 00:16:02.680]   know, solutions as well as the FaceTime.
[00:16:02.680 --> 00:16:05.200]   And I do think that FaceTime blows up for families.
[00:16:05.200 --> 00:16:09.960]   We do so much FaceTime now with my kids' grandparents, you know, like where they can,
[00:16:09.960 --> 00:16:14.440]   now that everybody's got an iPhone or an iPad or something, you know, the ability to let
[00:16:14.440 --> 00:16:18.400]   them, you know, say, "Hey, the kids are doing this and taking little videos and letting
[00:16:18.400 --> 00:16:21.320]   them talk to them and everything else now that the kids are getting more interactive."
[00:16:21.320 --> 00:16:24.280]   That's a very compelling thing, and it's more compelling when it's in the living room.
[00:16:24.280 --> 00:16:28.280]   You know, and I think that that, I don't think we, I, but I do think it's the total
[00:16:28.280 --> 00:16:29.280]   computing experience.
[00:16:29.280 --> 00:16:31.880]   It's getting rid of the computer, and I think this is what Apple's doing.
[00:16:31.880 --> 00:16:35.840]   And they're getting rid of the computer for the average person across the board.
[00:16:35.840 --> 00:16:39.800]   I mean, even with their own line, they're slowly, they're slowly winding it down, but
[00:16:39.800 --> 00:16:41.240]   I think that they're slowly just cutting off.
[00:16:41.240 --> 00:16:43.600]   Instead of trying to beat Windows, they're just creating a whole other game.
[00:16:43.600 --> 00:16:45.080]   It's adding everything is completely essential.
[00:16:45.080 --> 00:16:47.520]   And they're very good at expanding their experiences, right?
[00:16:47.520 --> 00:16:51.000]   So they started with the iPod, and that brought a lot of people to the Mac, and then they
[00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:53.880]   have the iPhone, and then all of a sudden, "Oh, hey, that there's an iPad.
[00:16:53.880 --> 00:16:54.880]   It's just like the iPhone.
[00:16:54.880 --> 00:16:57.840]   I can already use this if I buy one, and I think that's going to be a big selling point
[00:16:57.840 --> 00:16:58.840]   for the TV.
[00:16:58.840 --> 00:17:01.840]   You get a TV, and it's like, all of a sudden, you already know how to use it because you
[00:17:01.840 --> 00:17:04.280]   interact so well with the devices you already own."
[00:17:04.280 --> 00:17:05.520]   That's the Steve Jobs phrase.
[00:17:05.520 --> 00:17:07.760]   You already know how to use it.
[00:17:07.760 --> 00:17:08.760]   And that was key, wasn't it?
[00:17:08.760 --> 00:17:12.120]   In fact, to the acceptance of the iPad, was it was just a big iPhone.
[00:17:12.120 --> 00:17:13.120]   And I think that's why.
[00:17:13.120 --> 00:17:17.440]   It has sold so much better than competing Android devices.
[00:17:17.440 --> 00:17:20.360]   We have some videos that you took on the show floor.
[00:17:20.360 --> 00:17:22.760]   I know you, Alex, are going to be doing this.
[00:17:22.760 --> 00:17:23.760]   Do you--
[00:17:23.760 --> 00:17:25.760]   No, we actually shot these ones--
[00:17:25.760 --> 00:17:26.760]   With a real camera?
[00:17:26.760 --> 00:17:27.760]   --with a real camera.
[00:17:27.760 --> 00:17:28.760]   So Lynn's shot the gun.
[00:17:28.760 --> 00:17:29.760]   How do you do that?
[00:17:29.760 --> 00:17:30.760]   I know it's crazy.
[00:17:30.760 --> 00:17:31.760]   It was crazy.
[00:17:31.760 --> 00:17:36.000]   I shot them, and I ran around, and I came ready, but then I ended up--
[00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:37.000]   You know what I've been doing?
[00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:42.880]   I've been using my iPhone and doing audio boo, which is audio only, and social cam for video,
[00:17:42.880 --> 00:17:45.920]   and just blogging with audio and video.
[00:17:45.920 --> 00:17:51.120]   It's kind of got me back to my roots when I was an unaligned, unaffiliated journalist
[00:17:51.120 --> 00:17:52.680]   trying to get a story.
[00:17:52.680 --> 00:17:54.880]   It's remarkably refreshing that it's not--
[00:17:54.880 --> 00:17:56.680]   See, even with this, you've seen me.
[00:17:56.680 --> 00:17:57.680]   It's so simple.
[00:17:57.680 --> 00:17:58.680]   I start rigging things up, though.
[00:17:58.680 --> 00:17:59.960]   Yeah, you can't make anything simple.
[00:17:59.960 --> 00:18:01.760]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:18:01.760 --> 00:18:04.600]   What the hell is that?
[00:18:04.600 --> 00:18:05.600]   Dry this.
[00:18:05.600 --> 00:18:07.400]   Oh, it's Annie Shine.
[00:18:07.400 --> 00:18:08.400]   This is--
[00:18:08.400 --> 00:18:09.400]   Mattify.
[00:18:09.400 --> 00:18:10.400]   --Matify.
[00:18:10.400 --> 00:18:12.400]   Put a little here.
[00:18:12.400 --> 00:18:13.400]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:18:13.400 --> 00:18:20.040]   Dawn, isn't it wonderful that we have that natural beauty that just shines its way through
[00:18:20.040 --> 00:18:21.040]   with that?
[00:18:21.040 --> 00:18:22.040]   Look at that.
[00:18:22.040 --> 00:18:23.040]   The shine is gone.
[00:18:23.040 --> 00:18:24.040]   Isn't that crazy?
[00:18:24.040 --> 00:18:25.040]   Where can I buy more of that?
[00:18:25.040 --> 00:18:26.040]   I know.
[00:18:26.040 --> 00:18:27.040]   I can tub with that.
[00:18:27.040 --> 00:18:28.040]   So here's the thing.
[00:18:28.040 --> 00:18:29.840]   You're going to put it out of--
[00:18:29.840 --> 00:18:30.840]   They were going to get rid of it?
[00:18:30.840 --> 00:18:31.840]   Yeah, you know why?
[00:18:31.840 --> 00:18:33.320]   It's going to give me cancer.
[00:18:33.320 --> 00:18:34.320]   But--
[00:18:34.320 --> 00:18:35.320]   No shine.
[00:18:35.320 --> 00:18:36.320]   No, no.
[00:18:36.320 --> 00:18:38.920]   It's like when we were doing interviews in the Seychelles and we put this on someone,
[00:18:38.920 --> 00:18:42.560]   and literally the DP who worked all over the world in all these productions, I literally
[00:18:42.560 --> 00:18:46.280]   put it on the first subject and he looked at me and he goes, what did you just do?
[00:18:46.280 --> 00:18:48.120]   That's magic, especially the Seychelles.
[00:18:48.120 --> 00:18:50.120]   You need that, yeah.
[00:18:50.120 --> 00:18:53.560]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:18:53.560 --> 00:18:58.120]   So Ken, you came out as did Andy from the East Coast to Macworld Expo.
[00:18:58.120 --> 00:19:00.360]   You're coming back next year?
[00:19:00.360 --> 00:19:01.360]   Yeah.
[00:19:01.360 --> 00:19:02.360]   Absolutely.
[00:19:02.360 --> 00:19:03.360]   Oh, OK.
[00:19:03.360 --> 00:19:04.360]   Just checking.
[00:19:04.360 --> 00:19:05.360]   I mean, there's--
[00:19:05.360 --> 00:19:06.360]   Well, do you want to talk about it?
[00:19:06.360 --> 00:19:07.360]   It's kind of small.
[00:19:07.360 --> 00:19:08.760]   Kind of small, wasn't it?
[00:19:08.760 --> 00:19:09.760]   No.
[00:19:09.760 --> 00:19:10.760]   Well, I don't know.
[00:19:10.760 --> 00:19:13.120]   I was reading a few things when I came back.
[00:19:13.120 --> 00:19:16.240]   And the best thing that I found to sum it up is something that Chris Forresman over at
[00:19:16.240 --> 00:19:17.880]   our Technica wrote.
[00:19:17.880 --> 00:19:21.800]   As a tech journalist, Macworld has gradually become less interesting as a user of Apple's
[00:19:21.800 --> 00:19:26.720]   products and a geek in general, however, the show has become perhaps more interesting.
[00:19:26.720 --> 00:19:28.440]   Nicely put.
[00:19:28.440 --> 00:19:33.480]   I was glad to see him print that because I just kept having this sort of feeling like
[00:19:33.480 --> 00:19:36.600]   this feels better to me somehow, but I'm not sure why.
[00:19:36.600 --> 00:19:37.600]   Interesting.
[00:19:37.600 --> 00:19:38.600]   And that's really the way.
[00:19:38.600 --> 00:19:41.360]   There was a whole different energy, a whole different vibe.
[00:19:41.360 --> 00:19:43.520]   Yeah, I'll definitely be back.
[00:19:43.520 --> 00:19:46.080]   Small do it may have been.
[00:19:46.080 --> 00:19:49.240]   And Gene, you were-- you said no.
[00:19:49.240 --> 00:19:52.040]   Now, both you and Oliver go as exhibitors.
[00:19:52.040 --> 00:19:53.040]   Right.
[00:19:53.040 --> 00:19:54.800]   So it's a value to use an exhibitor?
[00:19:54.800 --> 00:19:57.160]   It's a fantastic value.
[00:19:57.160 --> 00:19:58.840]   It's like it must be decreasing value.
[00:19:58.840 --> 00:19:59.840]   I mean, Adobe's not there.
[00:19:59.840 --> 00:20:00.840]   Microsoft's there.
[00:20:00.840 --> 00:20:01.840]   Apple's not there.
[00:20:01.840 --> 00:20:03.320]   The reason these big companies aren't going.
[00:20:03.320 --> 00:20:05.520]   HP was the biggest company there.
[00:20:05.520 --> 00:20:07.800]   And I wondered why.
[00:20:07.800 --> 00:20:14.720]   Well, I think that you could argue, and I certainly have, is that with no Adobe and
[00:20:14.720 --> 00:20:19.840]   no Apple, the people who come to Macworld are Mac users-- I mean, there's some people
[00:20:19.840 --> 00:20:23.880]   who are not Mac users yet, but Mac people want to see Mac software.
[00:20:23.880 --> 00:20:28.840]   And so last year we were mobbed at our booth because it was just us and BusyCal practically.
[00:20:28.840 --> 00:20:29.840]   Yeah.
[00:20:29.840 --> 00:20:33.120]   And so we said we're definitely coming back and it was very busy.
[00:20:33.120 --> 00:20:36.160]   You say an interesting thing because I don't know how many booths there were there.
[00:20:36.160 --> 00:20:37.160]   It wasn't a whole lot.
[00:20:37.160 --> 00:20:38.160]   Well, let's put it this way.
[00:20:38.160 --> 00:20:41.040]   It seemed much smaller than the eyeliner at CES.
[00:20:41.040 --> 00:20:42.760]   I've never been.
[00:20:42.760 --> 00:20:44.320]   Do we have a number on it though?
[00:20:44.320 --> 00:20:47.320]   Because when I first walked in, my feeling was that there were actually more vendors.
[00:20:47.320 --> 00:20:49.720]   And I guess this might have been a nice thing to ask Paul while we were out there.
[00:20:49.720 --> 00:20:50.720]   I should ask.
[00:20:50.720 --> 00:20:54.040]   My feeling was that there were more vendors but in a smaller space.
[00:20:54.040 --> 00:20:59.440]   Like the Mac software side where Gene was, nuance was over there.
[00:20:59.440 --> 00:21:01.760]   Neuons last year had a bigger space.
[00:21:01.760 --> 00:21:04.680]   And this-- here they did.
[00:21:04.680 --> 00:21:11.880]   And so I don't know if that means that nuance decided to reduce its footprint or if the
[00:21:11.880 --> 00:21:13.880]   whole Mac side was smaller, I don't really know.
[00:21:13.880 --> 00:21:17.840]   But to me for a while, it felt like there were many more people there.
[00:21:17.840 --> 00:21:20.320]   Just crammed in tighter.
[00:21:20.320 --> 00:21:24.120]   I thought it was just a more target rich environment than it was last year.
[00:21:24.120 --> 00:21:27.720]   I got to admit that I was a little bit disappointed with last year's show because it really didn't
[00:21:27.720 --> 00:21:32.880]   take me long at all to feel as though not only had I walked through every aisle of the
[00:21:32.880 --> 00:21:36.800]   show last year but also that I have seen everything I would want to see.
[00:21:36.800 --> 00:21:43.160]   I have had in-depth conversations with as many exhibitors as the-- have in products I'm
[00:21:43.160 --> 00:21:44.480]   really interested in.
[00:21:44.480 --> 00:21:50.480]   This year I had about-- my schedule was really compressed and out of two hours I still was
[00:21:50.480 --> 00:21:52.360]   about 25% sure.
[00:21:52.360 --> 00:21:55.480]   There was still like one aisle and a half that I haven't covered yet.
[00:21:55.480 --> 00:21:57.720]   But it had more interesting things in it.
[00:21:57.720 --> 00:22:01.480]   More things you might recognize from like a Kickstarter campaign six or seven months
[00:22:01.480 --> 00:22:02.480]   ago.
[00:22:02.480 --> 00:22:07.280]   In fact, I was talking to a friend of mine who-- she's been a friend of mine for about
[00:22:07.280 --> 00:22:08.520]   10, 15 years.
[00:22:08.520 --> 00:22:14.600]   She is like very, very active and independent Mac and iOS developers as a PR rep.
[00:22:14.600 --> 00:22:17.680]   And she was saying that she felt as though this was-- she wished that she had gotten
[00:22:17.680 --> 00:22:21.520]   more of her clients here because it was-- that she felt as though it was a very, very good
[00:22:21.520 --> 00:22:22.520]   value.
[00:22:22.520 --> 00:22:26.400]   Every single member of the Mac and iOS press that you would want to have covering your
[00:22:26.400 --> 00:22:28.920]   product or covering your service was here.
[00:22:28.920 --> 00:22:35.160]   And as you say, there was no Adobe, there was no Apple, there was no huge like gargantuan
[00:22:35.160 --> 00:22:38.640]   vendor to-- exhibitor to distract people's attention from it.
[00:22:38.640 --> 00:22:40.560]   So I got a lot more value out of it.
[00:22:40.560 --> 00:22:44.480]   I certainly got at least four or five columns worth of information out of it.
[00:22:44.480 --> 00:22:46.440]   So I was pretty happy.
[00:22:46.440 --> 00:22:53.400]   My opinion was actually a little bit topsy-turvy from Ken's in that I thought it was
[00:22:53.400 --> 00:22:55.560]   certainly a good show for me.
[00:22:55.560 --> 00:22:59.440]   I thought it was an entertaining show, a huge step forward in terms of the content because
[00:22:59.440 --> 00:23:03.680]   I thought it was a more successful marriage of the old fashioned tutorials on how to get
[00:23:03.680 --> 00:23:09.760]   things done with your devices as well as just entertaining exhibitions like the interviews
[00:23:09.760 --> 00:23:14.360]   with the South Park Raiders, stuff with Jonathan Frakes, that sort of stuff.
[00:23:14.360 --> 00:23:17.840]   But when I was introduced to people who had flown like halfway across the world to be
[00:23:17.840 --> 00:23:19.520]   here, I was glad that they were there.
[00:23:19.520 --> 00:23:23.920]   I'm not sure that if they had asked me before they traveled, would you-- should I spend $2,000
[00:23:23.920 --> 00:23:29.000]   to fly out to Macworld, I would have to say, how much money do you have?
[00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:31.400]   Because if this is-- I get it-- I can't say that.
[00:23:31.400 --> 00:23:32.560]   It was an entertaining show.
[00:23:32.560 --> 00:23:35.960]   I'm not sure if I would survive personally in my budget as a freelance journalist and
[00:23:35.960 --> 00:23:41.000]   a print medium that's slowly dying, that I would spend $2,000 to attend this show.
[00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:42.000]   But it was very, very good.
[00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:45.120]   I'm really excited to see what happens next year because it's definitely on the correct
[00:23:45.120 --> 00:23:46.120]   trajectory.
[00:23:46.120 --> 00:23:48.640]   And I thought that this year's show was a good value for a lot of people.
[00:23:48.640 --> 00:23:53.760]   It is a transitional year, obviously, from-- and maybe that's partly what-- for me, I'm
[00:23:53.760 --> 00:23:54.760]   still living in the past.
[00:23:54.760 --> 00:23:57.120]   27 years, Macworld's been going on.
[00:23:57.120 --> 00:24:00.440]   Now I do have the press release, which I did just release-- thank you, IDG, for sending
[00:24:00.440 --> 00:24:07.880]   this out here-- 25,000 people, they said, 40% of whom were first-time attenders, 300 exhibitors
[00:24:07.880 --> 00:24:14.480]   and sponsors, 100 new products, 75 tech talks, and of course a much reduced price for the
[00:24:14.480 --> 00:24:19.200]   I-fan pass, only $80 if you wanted to go to that track.
[00:24:19.200 --> 00:24:24.160]   But it's a transitional-- I mean, it really is part of a transition from the way it used
[00:24:24.160 --> 00:24:25.160]   to be.
[00:24:25.160 --> 00:24:28.360]   It used to be you'd go to Moscone Center on Macworld Expo Day and the palpable excitement.
[00:24:28.360 --> 00:24:30.600]   There was the traffic jams, the number of people.
[00:24:30.600 --> 00:24:32.640]   And of course, that's because Steve Jobs was speaking.
[00:24:32.640 --> 00:24:33.640]   Apple was there.
[00:24:33.640 --> 00:24:35.480]   It was a very different event now.
[00:24:35.480 --> 00:24:38.840]   Oliver-- will Boinks continue to go?
[00:24:38.840 --> 00:24:39.840]   Certainly.
[00:24:39.840 --> 00:24:42.480]   I think it was very worthwhile for us to come over.
[00:24:42.480 --> 00:24:43.480]   That's the litmus test.
[00:24:43.480 --> 00:24:46.880]   Andy, did you stop by our booth?
[00:24:46.880 --> 00:24:48.600]   Unfortunately, I think you were--
[00:24:48.600 --> 00:24:50.840]   OK, we're looking back to the light.
[00:24:50.840 --> 00:24:51.840]   I had to do it.
[00:24:51.840 --> 00:24:52.840]   I saw Oliver there.
[00:24:52.840 --> 00:24:53.840]   I saw Oliver there.
[00:24:53.840 --> 00:24:54.840]   You missed us too.
[00:24:54.840 --> 00:24:55.840]   You making it up now?
[00:24:55.840 --> 00:24:56.840]   Yeah.
[00:24:56.840 --> 00:24:57.840]   So I saw you.
[00:24:57.840 --> 00:25:02.320]   I did go by you, but I completely missed your booth and I apologize.
[00:25:02.320 --> 00:25:03.320]   Where was your booth?
[00:25:03.320 --> 00:25:05.480]   It was actually in the mobile apps showcase.
[00:25:05.480 --> 00:25:07.720]   It just shows you that it is big enough.
[00:25:07.720 --> 00:25:09.760]   It is big enough to miss something.
[00:25:09.760 --> 00:25:10.760]   Yeah.
[00:25:10.760 --> 00:25:11.760]   Yeah, so--
[00:25:11.760 --> 00:25:12.760]   Go ahead.
[00:25:12.760 --> 00:25:13.760]   I'll say something.
[00:25:13.760 --> 00:25:18.560]   So it was worthwhile for us and the strategy clearly was that we wanted to have a lot of
[00:25:18.560 --> 00:25:23.760]   like a little pod there on the mobile app showcase as sort of a meeting point.
[00:25:23.760 --> 00:25:26.040]   You had a pod, not a meeting point.
[00:25:26.040 --> 00:25:31.800]   And the meeting point, you know, on the one hand for the users and on the other hand,
[00:25:31.800 --> 00:25:38.160]   of course, for people like yourself, the press and other important multipliers.
[00:25:38.160 --> 00:25:42.240]   And I think it worked out quite well, not, you know, notwithstanding that we won two awards,
[00:25:42.240 --> 00:25:43.240]   actually.
[00:25:43.240 --> 00:25:44.240]   Yeah, that's not the best.
[00:25:44.240 --> 00:25:45.240]   What was the other one you guys heard?
[00:25:45.240 --> 00:25:46.240]   The makeup server.
[00:25:46.240 --> 00:25:48.320]   It is the editor's choice.
[00:25:48.320 --> 00:25:49.320]   Very nice.
[00:25:49.320 --> 00:25:50.920]   And smile won that as well.
[00:25:50.920 --> 00:25:56.280]   The smile booth was on the same side of, you know, we were neighbors on the mobile app
[00:25:56.280 --> 00:25:57.280]   showcase.
[00:25:57.280 --> 00:26:01.360]   And so we decided to petition for next year to call this the award zone.
[00:26:01.360 --> 00:26:04.920]   Because between the two of us, we had like five awards.
[00:26:04.920 --> 00:26:05.920]   And I have to say, it's not why--
[00:26:05.920 --> 00:26:06.920]   She's a head one.
[00:26:06.920 --> 00:26:07.920]   It's not why you and she are here.
[00:26:07.920 --> 00:26:10.120]   It's just because you're friends and we love you.
[00:26:10.120 --> 00:26:12.640]   But hey, that's pretty cool.
[00:26:12.640 --> 00:26:14.440]   We got the award winners here, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:26:14.440 --> 00:26:17.040]   It's like Harold Street and Dustin Hoffman of Mac.
[00:26:17.040 --> 00:26:18.040]   Oh, yes.
[00:26:18.040 --> 00:26:19.520]   Multi-multi award winners.
[00:26:19.520 --> 00:26:20.520]   But no, I--
[00:26:20.520 --> 00:26:22.280]   Do I look like Dustin Hoffman?
[00:26:22.280 --> 00:26:23.280]   Oh, yeah.
[00:26:23.280 --> 00:26:24.280]   Later.
[00:26:24.280 --> 00:26:25.280]   Yeah, middle street.
[00:26:25.280 --> 00:26:26.280]   Oh, OK.
[00:26:26.280 --> 00:26:28.080]   No, I look like--
[00:26:28.080 --> 00:26:30.920]   That's not nice.
[00:26:30.920 --> 00:26:39.000]   The thing that kind of really bummed me out was the Mac OS X Ally.
[00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:42.080]   This was-- I mean, so you make Mac software.
[00:26:42.080 --> 00:26:45.440]   You both make Mac software.
[00:26:45.440 --> 00:26:49.480]   Is this some sort of reflection of the fact that Apple's kind of become not a computer
[00:26:49.480 --> 00:26:51.440]   company but a consumer electronics company?
[00:26:51.440 --> 00:26:52.600]   Is OS X dead?
[00:26:52.600 --> 00:26:54.480]   Is software for OS X dead?
[00:26:54.480 --> 00:26:57.520]   Why was it such an Ally?
[00:26:57.520 --> 00:27:03.400]   Well, you know, it's interesting because we did this last year in 2011.
[00:27:03.400 --> 00:27:05.960]   And we were in what was called like the--
[00:27:05.960 --> 00:27:07.840]   I don't know-- the indie pavilion or whatever.
[00:27:07.840 --> 00:27:09.640]   And there were actually fewer booths.
[00:27:09.640 --> 00:27:12.720]   But the way that it was set up, it was easier to see them.
[00:27:12.720 --> 00:27:15.440]   It didn't have quite this like, oh, the back Ally of Mac.
[00:27:15.440 --> 00:27:16.920]   It was--
[00:27:16.920 --> 00:27:18.040]   I was stunned.
[00:27:18.040 --> 00:27:18.840]   They even had signs.
[00:27:18.840 --> 00:27:21.320]   It almost looked like, you know, don't--
[00:27:21.320 --> 00:27:22.960]   You must be 21.
[00:27:22.960 --> 00:27:24.760]   Abandoned all this time.
[00:27:24.760 --> 00:27:26.160]   See who entered here, whatever.
[00:27:26.160 --> 00:27:27.760]   It was like, oh my god.
[00:27:27.760 --> 00:27:29.800]   It's the OS X zone.
[00:27:29.800 --> 00:27:30.280]   Yeah.
[00:27:30.280 --> 00:27:36.520]   I mean, it was-- in fact, we decided at the last minute to take a booth in mobile apps
[00:27:36.520 --> 00:27:38.640]   as well because we were showing an iPad app.
[00:27:38.640 --> 00:27:41.240]   And we weren't quite sure what the traffic was going to be.
[00:27:41.240 --> 00:27:42.240]   Maybe we could go back there.
[00:27:42.240 --> 00:27:46.720]   You know, often that area is very-- even though it's out of the way, it's very popular
[00:27:46.720 --> 00:27:50.280]   because everybody, like you say, want to go to Tiny Town, that's where like the new--
[00:27:50.280 --> 00:27:51.280]   Exciting.
[00:27:51.280 --> 00:27:55.080]   But the way it was set up this year, I would say bad function way.
[00:27:55.080 --> 00:27:55.600]   Right.
[00:27:55.600 --> 00:27:56.440]   And--
[00:27:56.440 --> 00:27:57.440]   So maybe that's all it was.
[00:27:57.440 --> 00:27:58.440]   I think that's what it was.
[00:27:58.440 --> 00:27:58.440]   I don't think--
[00:27:58.440 --> 00:27:59.440]   Maybe it's all of that solid.
[00:27:59.440 --> 00:28:00.240]   It's just where it was.
[00:28:00.240 --> 00:28:04.480]   There were definitely more Mac developers like us there this year than last.
[00:28:04.480 --> 00:28:07.960]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:28:08.960 --> 00:28:09.960]   All right.
[00:28:09.960 --> 00:28:12.960]   Don't think it was a rubber stopper.
[00:28:12.960 --> 00:28:13.960]   Alex, you want some--
[00:28:13.960 --> 00:28:14.960]   Oh.
[00:28:14.960 --> 00:28:15.960]   Where is the rubber stopper?
[00:28:15.960 --> 00:28:16.960]   Oh, I would love--
[00:28:16.960 --> 00:28:17.960]   Is that it?
[00:28:17.960 --> 00:28:18.960]   I would love it.
[00:28:18.960 --> 00:28:19.960]   Oh, this, you mean?
[00:28:19.960 --> 00:28:20.960]   Andy, can you hear us?
[00:28:20.960 --> 00:28:22.960]   Rubber stopper goes in the bottom of the plastic.
[00:28:22.960 --> 00:28:24.840]   Oh, I see it right there.
[00:28:24.840 --> 00:28:26.560]   That's very important.
[00:28:26.560 --> 00:28:27.560]   It's in with the filters.
[00:28:27.560 --> 00:28:30.960]   It's lost just like it holds the light of recent--
[00:28:30.960 --> 00:28:32.360]   Yeah, the whole thing is shot.
[00:28:32.360 --> 00:28:35.160]   This looks-- anything that looks like a flask.
[00:28:35.160 --> 00:28:37.800]   You know, it looks like it's going to work for me.
[00:28:37.800 --> 00:28:39.400]   Mike Ilgin, that might be you.
[00:28:39.400 --> 00:28:40.400]   Oztuddy formed.
[00:28:40.400 --> 00:28:42.200]   That would be me hanging on the side.
[00:28:42.200 --> 00:28:43.200]   So this goes in here?
[00:28:43.200 --> 00:28:44.200]   No.
[00:28:44.200 --> 00:28:47.200]   It goes in the bottom of that big plastic thing.
[00:28:47.200 --> 00:28:49.200]   Oh, yeah, very important goes in here.
[00:28:49.200 --> 00:28:51.000]   It's for 12 hours.
[00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:52.120]   OK, I got it.
[00:28:52.120 --> 00:28:55.440]   So then this goes in here.
[00:28:55.440 --> 00:28:58.440]   And then you put coffee and water in here.
[00:28:58.440 --> 00:28:59.440]   And you put it in the fridge?
[00:28:59.440 --> 00:29:00.440]   Yes.
[00:29:00.440 --> 00:29:01.640]   And you let it sit for 12 hours.
[00:29:01.640 --> 00:29:04.080]   You need a product shot?
[00:29:04.080 --> 00:29:07.640]   You really should seal this though because it's oxidizing, isn't it?
[00:29:07.640 --> 00:29:09.640]   You let the filter, you put it in the coffee.
[00:29:09.640 --> 00:29:11.120]   Where's the filter go?
[00:29:11.120 --> 00:29:12.120]   It goes in the bottom here.
[00:29:12.120 --> 00:29:15.160]   So any kind of water put in 6 ounces of coffee,
[00:29:15.160 --> 00:29:18.160]   putting in 3 ounces of the coffee, putting in water.
[00:29:18.160 --> 00:29:19.160]   Oh, you layer it.

[00:43:13.380 --> 00:43:14.380]   It's great stuff.
[00:43:14.380 --> 00:43:20.380]   If you enjoy coffee and/or are a serious caffeine addict, he says drink responsibly.
[00:43:20.380 --> 00:43:25.380]   No more than 100 milliliters, three and a half ounces a day.
[00:43:25.380 --> 00:43:30.380]   You could go into the fibrillation with this.
[00:43:30.380 --> 00:43:34.380]   Yes, or you might run into toxicity issues.
[00:43:34.380 --> 00:43:39.380]   Well, if you drank too much, it's possible to over-indulge in anything.
[00:43:39.380 --> 00:43:42.380]   It's great stuff.
[00:43:42.380 --> 00:43:43.380]   It's very flavorful.
[00:43:43.380 --> 00:43:47.380]   If you enjoy the flavor of coffee or if you...
[00:43:47.380 --> 00:43:49.380]   But I put cream and sugar in my coffee.
[00:43:49.380 --> 00:43:54.380]   I know that's anathema, but again, I've been spoiled by articrat for many years.
[00:43:54.380 --> 00:44:01.380]   Well, if you try this with a little milk, you know...
[00:44:01.380 --> 00:44:02.380]   That's okay?
[00:44:02.380 --> 00:44:03.380]   Yeah.
[00:44:03.380 --> 00:44:04.380]   That's allowed?
[00:44:04.380 --> 00:44:05.380]   Yeah.
[00:44:05.380 --> 00:44:06.380]   I'm ordering some right now.
[00:44:06.380 --> 00:44:07.380]   Yeah.
[00:44:07.380 --> 00:44:08.380]   Enjoy it.
[00:44:08.380 --> 00:44:09.380]   Try it.
[00:44:09.380 --> 00:44:11.380]   We're serving this at Twit from now on.
[00:44:11.380 --> 00:44:14.380]   Forget the wine and beer and whiskey.
[00:44:14.380 --> 00:44:17.380]   The black blood of the earth from now on.
[00:44:17.380 --> 00:44:18.380]   That's right.
[00:44:18.380 --> 00:44:19.380]   This is great stuff.
[00:44:19.380 --> 00:44:23.380]   And I highly endorse this product.
[00:44:23.380 --> 00:44:27.380]   Now, right now he's doing a Peruvian...
[00:44:27.380 --> 00:44:29.380]   Or you could get a Rwandan.
[00:44:29.380 --> 00:44:32.380]   So these are all single quatamolica.
[00:44:32.380 --> 00:44:33.380]   Which do you like?
[00:44:33.380 --> 00:44:38.380]   Well, I've had a sampling of things so far.
[00:44:38.380 --> 00:44:42.380]   And I'm on a bottle of the Rwandan right now.
[00:44:42.380 --> 00:44:45.380]   And it's very nice.
[00:44:45.380 --> 00:44:47.380]   The aba kundakawa.
[00:44:47.380 --> 00:44:50.380]   Yeah, you could try the sampler.
[00:44:50.380 --> 00:44:51.380]   That's what I'm going to do.
[00:44:51.380 --> 00:44:52.380]   I'm going to get the...
[00:44:52.380 --> 00:44:56.380]   They have a $50 limited run sampler.
[00:44:56.380 --> 00:44:59.380]   These look like vials of blood.
[00:44:59.380 --> 00:45:02.380]   Oh my goodness.
[00:45:02.380 --> 00:45:04.380]   Well, they are in a very real sense.
[00:45:04.380 --> 00:45:09.380]   Holy cow...
[00:45:09.380 --> 00:45:10.380]   I'm ordering this.
[00:45:10.380 --> 00:45:11.380]   We'll do it on the show.
[00:45:11.380 --> 00:45:14.380]   We'll do it as soon as it comes.
[00:45:14.380 --> 00:45:15.380]   Yeah, have a tasting.
[00:45:15.380 --> 00:45:16.380]   Yeah.
[00:45:16.380 --> 00:45:17.380]   It's rich.
[00:45:17.380 --> 00:45:19.380]   Especially if you've got coffee fiends in the house.
[00:45:19.380 --> 00:45:20.380]   Oh, we do.
[00:45:20.380 --> 00:45:21.380]   We live on coffee, right?
[00:45:21.380 --> 00:45:22.380]   Right.
[00:45:22.380 --> 00:45:24.380]   I mean, remember it's unsweetened.
[00:45:24.380 --> 00:45:25.380]   It's unflavored.
[00:45:25.380 --> 00:45:27.380]   It's just what comes out of it.
[00:45:27.380 --> 00:45:28.380]   Right.
[00:45:28.380 --> 00:45:29.380]   They have...
[00:45:29.380 --> 00:45:33.380]   This comes with Death Wish, which is a soul-blackening dark roast.
[00:45:33.380 --> 00:45:34.380]   Yeah.
[00:45:34.380 --> 00:45:38.380]   Guadalmaulin mundo novo, medium roast, and Colombian paise,
[00:45:38.380 --> 00:45:41.380]   medium roast, and then the Rwandan.
[00:45:41.380 --> 00:45:45.380]   Plus two vials of mystery will be chosen by my capricious whim.
[00:45:45.380 --> 00:45:46.380]   Wow.
[00:45:46.380 --> 00:45:48.380]   [laughter]
[00:45:48.380 --> 00:45:53.380]   Rich, I think you're great, but I understand why the universe led you to our show today.
[00:45:53.380 --> 00:45:54.380]   Yes.
[00:45:54.380 --> 00:45:55.380]   Yes.
[00:45:55.380 --> 00:45:59.380]   The universe has led us to the black blood of the earth.
[00:45:59.380 --> 00:46:01.380]   Is there anything else you recommend?
[00:46:01.380 --> 00:46:03.380]   Is there a special consumption device?
[00:46:03.380 --> 00:46:05.380]   Perhaps a syringe?
[00:46:05.380 --> 00:46:06.380]   No.
[00:46:06.380 --> 00:46:09.380]   I do not recommend injecting this.
[00:46:09.380 --> 00:46:15.380]   You should consume it orally as 50 milliliters per aura per day.
[00:46:15.380 --> 00:46:21.380]   And Burke in our chat room is wondering, do you need to wear gloves when you're touching this brew?
[00:46:21.380 --> 00:46:27.380]   If you spill the Death Wish, you may wish you had, but the rest of it is fine.
[00:46:27.380 --> 00:46:31.380]   Do not spill on its way to your gullet.
[00:46:31.380 --> 00:46:32.380]   That's right.
[00:46:32.380 --> 00:46:35.380]   Andy and I, co, you're picking the week.
[00:46:35.380 --> 00:46:38.380]   I don't know if you could top that one.
[00:46:38.380 --> 00:46:39.380]   I believe.
[00:46:39.380 --> 00:46:49.380]   I mean, I'm hoping that like if you do get this in the office for the entire day, I want you to have a little indicator on all-foot broadcasts indicating how much of this Leo has.
[00:46:49.380 --> 00:46:51.380]   That's a great idea.
[00:46:51.380 --> 00:46:54.380]   This puts five-hour energy drink in the backseat.
[00:46:54.380 --> 00:46:57.380]   I mean, this is not, this is, this is for serious people.
[00:46:57.380 --> 00:46:59.380]   We ever tried pocket coffee.
[00:46:59.380 --> 00:47:00.380]   Yes.
[00:47:00.380 --> 00:47:01.380]   I know about pocket coffee.
[00:47:01.380 --> 00:47:04.380]   This is like a shot of espresso wrapped in chocolates.
[00:47:04.380 --> 00:47:05.380]   You can actually.
[00:47:05.380 --> 00:47:06.380]   Yeah, I love it.
[00:47:06.380 --> 00:47:07.380]   Okay.
[00:47:07.380 --> 00:47:08.380]   Yeah.
[00:47:08.380 --> 00:47:09.380]   Love it.
[00:47:09.380 --> 00:47:14.380]   Sometimes I just eat the beans whole because I find I just want to, but this sounds like they've done all the work for you.
[00:47:14.380 --> 00:47:16.380]   It's like pre-chewed coffee.
[00:47:16.380 --> 00:47:19.380]   It sounds like they need to sell this from an offshore eyelid.
[00:47:19.380 --> 00:47:21.380]   Sure they are.
[00:47:21.380 --> 00:47:24.380]   This is a Jonathan Colton mad scientist guy.
[00:47:24.380 --> 00:47:25.380]   I could tell.
[00:47:25.380 --> 00:47:29.380]   And then then eight years from now, everyone turns into like animal man.
[00:47:29.380 --> 00:47:32.380]   It was just all a dive awful.
[00:47:32.380 --> 00:47:36.380]   You know, for 250 bucks, you can buy a 350 milliliter rugged Stein of science.
[00:47:36.380 --> 00:47:37.380]   I don't know.
[00:47:37.380 --> 00:47:39.380]   Do you have one of these rich?
[00:47:39.380 --> 00:47:42.380]   No, I don't have any of the Stein's.
[00:47:42.380 --> 00:47:46.380]   They look appealing, but I haven't found an excuse to get one yet.
[00:47:46.380 --> 00:47:47.380]   It's fairly expensive.
[00:47:47.380 --> 00:47:52.380]   They have, they have a 4900 milliliter one.
[00:47:52.380 --> 00:47:54.380]   What would you put in that?
[00:47:54.380 --> 00:47:55.380]   Everything.
[00:47:55.380 --> 00:47:56.380]   I see.
[00:47:56.380 --> 00:47:58.380]   Here's my cup.
[00:47:58.380 --> 00:47:59.380]   I see.
[00:47:59.380 --> 00:48:00.380]   Hmm.
[00:48:00.380 --> 00:48:03.380]   But you wouldn't want to fill it up with his stuff.
[00:48:03.380 --> 00:48:07.780]   Well, no, the Stein keeps things cold.
[00:48:07.780 --> 00:48:09.380]   The Stein keeps things cold or hot.
[00:48:09.380 --> 00:48:14.380]   I mean, you could brew hot coffee into it, but I think the Stein was originally conceived
[00:48:14.380 --> 00:48:16.380]   for cold drinks such as beers and soda.
[00:48:16.380 --> 00:48:18.380]   They also have a brass.
[00:48:18.380 --> 00:48:19.380]   Oh, that's very steampunk.
[00:48:19.380 --> 00:48:21.380]   I think I do need to order that.
[00:48:21.380 --> 00:48:23.380]   Yeah, he's got some lovely gear there.
[00:48:23.380 --> 00:48:24.380]   Yeah.
[00:48:24.380 --> 00:48:25.380]   But not required.
[00:48:25.380 --> 00:48:26.380]   No.
[00:48:26.380 --> 00:48:29.380]   No, the two are completely separate.
[00:48:29.380 --> 00:48:34.380]   The black blood of the earth and the Stein's of science are not related.
[00:48:34.380 --> 00:48:41.220]   This is, I'm going to send this to Steve Gibson for his five shot Venti lattes.
[00:48:41.220 --> 00:48:44.380]   This is a 1000 milliliters, shiny Stein of science.
[00:48:44.380 --> 00:48:46.380]   Here we go.
[00:48:46.380 --> 00:48:50.620]   You want the 4300 milliliter full metal jacket Stein of science.
[00:48:50.620 --> 00:48:51.620]   You think so?
[00:48:51.620 --> 00:48:52.620]   That's the one I really want.
[00:48:52.620 --> 00:48:55.380]   Yeah, that's like a week's worth of beer.
[00:48:55.380 --> 00:48:59.820]   A 1000 is a little more than one really should.
[00:48:59.820 --> 00:49:08.300]   But it will, it will stay cold all the way down.
[00:49:08.300 --> 00:49:11.740]   Do we want to talk about, I don't want to talk about, but I'll mention it.
[00:49:11.740 --> 00:49:18.140]   Google circumventing the iOS Safari's third party cookie protection.
[00:49:18.140 --> 00:49:19.620]   This is what I think.
[00:49:19.620 --> 00:49:20.620]   But a bunch of tricks.
[00:49:20.620 --> 00:49:22.740]   I'm serious.
[00:49:22.740 --> 00:49:25.980]   The conversation starts with what a bunch of tricks.
[00:49:25.980 --> 00:49:29.540]   We don't know how high up this decision came, but the fact that this actually went into
[00:49:29.540 --> 00:49:32.180]   a live code says, oh, my disagree.
[00:49:32.180 --> 00:49:33.780]   That's humiliatingly bad.
[00:49:33.780 --> 00:49:34.780]   I disagree.
[00:49:34.780 --> 00:49:36.580]   But anyway, go ahead and let this work.
[00:49:36.580 --> 00:49:39.220]   This is the way I kind of look at Facebook and it at Google.
[00:49:39.220 --> 00:49:41.980]   It's like they're in a prison cell.
[00:49:41.980 --> 00:49:47.420]   And during the day, they've got this poster, a ferafaucet on the wall.
[00:49:47.420 --> 00:49:52.100]   And then at night, they peel that back and with a spoon, they're digging away at the
[00:49:52.100 --> 00:49:54.900]   wall that is our privacy.
[00:49:54.900 --> 00:50:00.260]   And then every so often, a senator comes by with the Billy Club and kind of goes, da-da-da-da-da-da
[00:50:00.260 --> 00:50:01.260]   across the bars.
[00:50:01.260 --> 00:50:05.020]   And at which point they're back in the bunk and the poster's back in place, the senator
[00:50:05.020 --> 00:50:08.020]   leaves and then they're back again with the spoon.
[00:50:08.020 --> 00:50:10.260]   But really, did they interfere with your privacy?
[00:50:10.260 --> 00:50:15.220]   All they did was put code in there that allowed them to put a plus one button, which wouldn't
[00:50:15.220 --> 00:50:17.820]   mean anything unless you were logged into Google at the time.
[00:50:17.820 --> 00:50:19.300]   Yeah, but I think this is so much of the--
[00:50:19.300 --> 00:50:21.020]   They already know you're logged into Google.
[00:50:21.020 --> 00:50:24.300]   So much of it is about the spirit of this, which they ignore.
[00:50:24.300 --> 00:50:27.620]   And what they do is they look at their contractor, they look at whatever the specs are, they
[00:50:27.620 --> 00:50:32.060]   say, well, technically, we didn't do anything wrong because we're not collecting your personal
[00:50:32.060 --> 00:50:33.060]   data, we're just doing this.
[00:50:33.060 --> 00:50:37.540]   But if you look at the spirit of it, which is basically, would you please get out of my
[00:50:37.540 --> 00:50:39.060]   business?
[00:50:39.060 --> 00:50:43.260]   And I think both Facebook and Google do whatever they can to get in your business.
[00:50:43.260 --> 00:50:45.860]   To me, it's even simpler than that.
[00:50:45.860 --> 00:50:50.860]   It is, I really just want to shake them by the throat and say, this is not a freaking
[00:50:50.860 --> 00:50:51.940]   game.
[00:50:51.940 --> 00:50:58.380]   If there is a user setting that says, I desire this level of privacy and you do something
[00:50:58.380 --> 00:51:03.940]   to specifically circumvent that setting, you are a bunch of jerks.
[00:51:03.940 --> 00:51:10.380]   Just like if I can specifically tell any advertiser, I do not respond to pop up advertising
[00:51:10.380 --> 00:51:11.380]   on websites.
[00:51:11.380 --> 00:51:14.340]   I hate it, I never use it, I just don't like it at all.
[00:51:14.340 --> 00:51:18.860]   I have voted and indicated that preference by installing software that defeats these
[00:51:18.860 --> 00:51:19.860]   things.
[00:51:19.860 --> 00:51:22.620]   If you then put in code that tries to get around that saying, oh, well, I bet that
[00:51:22.620 --> 00:51:24.900]   I bet that he would respond to my ad.
[00:51:24.900 --> 00:51:27.100]   That's because he hasn't been targeted effectively.
[00:51:27.100 --> 00:51:31.540]   Or as I really believe is the case with some of these decisions that I really believe there's
[00:51:31.540 --> 00:51:35.300]   a sense of arrogance in which they're saying screw him.
[00:51:35.300 --> 00:51:36.500]   That's not his decision.
[00:51:36.500 --> 00:51:40.060]   If we can get this cookie installed, we will install this cookie.
[00:51:40.060 --> 00:51:46.140]   How dare he do something to stop us from our God given moral right to collect as much
[00:51:46.140 --> 00:51:47.980]   information as we can.
[00:51:47.980 --> 00:51:49.620]   This will fix his wagon.
[00:51:49.620 --> 00:51:53.340]   Screw Andy and not go screw Chris Breen, screw all those users.
[00:51:53.340 --> 00:51:55.980]   We are entitled to every piece of information we get.
[00:51:55.980 --> 00:51:56.980]   I would buy that.
[00:51:56.980 --> 00:51:58.980]   That's what gets me really, really upset.
[00:51:58.980 --> 00:52:05.580]   I would buy that if Apple had, I mean, this was a default setting to block third party
[00:52:05.580 --> 00:52:06.580]   cookies.
[00:52:06.580 --> 00:52:10.780]   Sites allow cookies only from sites you have visited.
[00:52:10.780 --> 00:52:11.780]   That is the default setting.
[00:52:11.780 --> 00:52:16.140]   Apple does say something about it on the desktop, but does not say anything about it on iOS.
[00:52:16.140 --> 00:52:20.140]   So it really was no iPhone user necessarily has chosen that.
[00:52:20.140 --> 00:52:23.140]   Apple's chosen that for them.
[00:52:23.140 --> 00:52:28.540]   By the same token, they've also not chosen to upload to Google every photo that I have
[00:52:28.540 --> 00:52:29.540]   on my heart.
[00:52:29.540 --> 00:52:30.540]   I understand.
[00:52:30.540 --> 00:52:31.540]   They've also not chosen.
[00:52:31.540 --> 00:52:32.540]   Okay.
[00:52:32.540 --> 00:52:34.700]   But I think it's not so clear because I think it's a sense.
[00:52:34.700 --> 00:52:36.580]   I really do think it's clear.
[00:52:36.580 --> 00:52:40.980]   Anytime you make that conscious decision as a developer that says, here is a protection
[00:52:40.980 --> 00:52:45.460]   against this thing that I'm trying to do, I'm going to exploit a bug or a weakness to
[00:52:45.460 --> 00:52:47.300]   get around that protection.
[00:52:47.300 --> 00:52:52.220]   You suddenly, you're not a criminal, but now you've taken one step more into the direction
[00:52:52.220 --> 00:52:53.620]   towards being a criminal.
[00:52:53.620 --> 00:52:54.900]   What about the contention?
[00:52:54.900 --> 00:52:56.100]   Here's my contention.
[00:52:56.100 --> 00:52:59.420]   I believe Apple set that not to protect my privacy.
[00:52:59.420 --> 00:53:02.180]   I believe Apple set that to protect I adds.
[00:53:02.180 --> 00:53:06.060]   What they would like to do is say, "Hey, nobody can have any information about our customers,
[00:53:06.060 --> 00:53:07.900]   except us."
[00:53:07.900 --> 00:53:12.820]   And so as a result, they are very careful to, quote, protect my privacy except when it comes
[00:53:12.820 --> 00:53:14.260]   to I adds.
[00:53:14.260 --> 00:53:15.580]   Apple's not interested in privacy.
[00:53:15.580 --> 00:53:18.420]   They're interested in market protection.
[00:53:18.420 --> 00:53:26.900]   And Google didn't even do this in such a way to impose on my privacy merely to put a plus
[00:53:26.900 --> 00:53:34.780]   one button on ads, on sites that somebody who has signed into Google has already said,
[00:53:34.780 --> 00:53:37.540]   "I want a plus one button in effect."
[00:53:37.540 --> 00:53:40.900]   So what Google's doing is saying to Apple, "Hey, no.
[00:53:40.900 --> 00:53:45.100]   In fact, our customers are telling us they want to be signed into Google.
[00:53:45.100 --> 00:53:50.380]   They want a plus one button, and you're blocking it as market protection, not as privacy.
[00:53:50.380 --> 00:53:51.380]   How about that argument?
[00:53:51.380 --> 00:53:52.380]   Okay.
[00:53:52.380 --> 00:53:54.020]   Well, turn your iPhone over.
[00:53:54.020 --> 00:53:55.020]   What logo is there?
[00:53:55.020 --> 00:53:56.220]   It's not a Google logo.
[00:53:56.220 --> 00:53:57.220]   It's an Apple logo.
[00:53:57.220 --> 00:54:00.940]   Well, that's why I don't use an iPhone, Andy, but I don't think that Apple is on the side
[00:54:00.940 --> 00:54:01.940]   of the essentials here.
[00:54:01.940 --> 00:54:03.180]   I think that's a mistake to assume.
[00:54:03.180 --> 00:54:04.180]   Okay.
[00:54:04.180 --> 00:54:08.780]   Well, I'm not going to speculate as to the reasons why that the default settings for this
[00:54:08.780 --> 00:54:10.620]   Fari browser are the way they are.
[00:54:10.620 --> 00:54:13.820]   It's possible that what you say is correct that this is a long-range strategic sort of
[00:54:13.820 --> 00:54:16.260]   thing where they don't want competition from the I adds.
[00:54:16.260 --> 00:54:20.900]   It's possible, though, that they are truly saying, "What would the user want in this situation?
[00:54:20.900 --> 00:54:23.340]   Would they want a stronger browser that protects their privacy?
[00:54:23.340 --> 00:54:25.940]   Or would they want a weaker browser that protects our privacy?"
[00:54:25.940 --> 00:54:26.940]   You can't speculate.
[00:54:26.940 --> 00:54:30.180]   Or would they want a browser that breaks Google?
[00:54:30.180 --> 00:54:33.060]   See, I don't think Apple wants to break Google.
[00:54:33.060 --> 00:54:34.860]   It breaks all the boats in the harbor.
[00:54:34.860 --> 00:54:37.500]   They don't think of the same rate.
[00:54:37.500 --> 00:54:39.420]   It really is a philosophical thing.
[00:54:39.420 --> 00:54:44.180]   If there is a locked door, I really think you can get through that lock because, oh,
[00:54:44.180 --> 00:54:45.820]   geez, it's actually like a four-pin lock.
[00:54:45.820 --> 00:54:48.340]   I got a paperclip of Mac and Easley get past that.
[00:54:48.340 --> 00:54:51.540]   But there is a principle that says that this person locked this door for a reason.
[00:54:51.540 --> 00:54:52.540]   It's not the door.
[00:54:52.540 --> 00:54:55.620]   He didn't do it to bar me from getting access to things I've arrived to.
[00:54:55.620 --> 00:54:58.820]   It's not as though there's a public bathroom that everyone's supposed to use and he locked
[00:54:58.820 --> 00:55:00.540]   it so that he could have it for himself.
[00:55:00.540 --> 00:55:03.060]   This is a private door for the private lock.
[00:55:03.060 --> 00:55:07.340]   As soon as you try to open that lock without anybody's permission or without anybody's
[00:55:07.340 --> 00:55:11.620]   knowledge, you have taken a step away from the angels and towards the point you picked
[00:55:11.620 --> 00:55:12.620]   for a sort of guy.
[00:55:12.620 --> 00:55:13.620]   And I agree.
[00:55:13.620 --> 00:55:15.420]   We cannot know Apple's intention here.
[00:55:15.420 --> 00:55:17.900]   So I'm not going to impute Apple's intention.
[00:55:17.900 --> 00:55:23.660]   But the choice to lock the door was, in fact, not the user's choice, was Apple's choice.
[00:55:23.660 --> 00:55:26.060]   And Apple did not publicize it.
[00:55:26.060 --> 00:55:28.420]   So let me put this.
[00:55:28.420 --> 00:55:32.660]   If I go to a site where I expect a plus one button because I'm logged on to Google and
[00:55:32.660 --> 00:55:36.340]   I don't get it, I may not know why I'm not getting the plus one button.
[00:55:36.340 --> 00:55:38.620]   I may not know enough to go in there and change that setting.
[00:55:38.620 --> 00:55:40.620]   Maybe I want that button.
[00:55:40.620 --> 00:55:41.780]   I want to put it this way.
[00:55:41.780 --> 00:55:46.220]   Let's say that a developer releases an app that decides, well, the default setting for
[00:55:46.220 --> 00:55:51.260]   gatekeeper on Mount Lion is to not allow apps that have not been signed.
[00:55:51.260 --> 00:55:53.340]   I'm not sure the user really wants that.
[00:55:53.340 --> 00:55:57.660]   So I'm going to exploit this loophole to allow this piece of code to install and execute,
[00:55:57.660 --> 00:55:59.860]   even though it hasn't been signed by everybody.
[00:55:59.860 --> 00:56:00.860]   Are you still?
[00:56:00.860 --> 00:56:01.860]   That's enderating.
[00:56:01.860 --> 00:56:02.860]   I agree.
[00:56:02.860 --> 00:56:03.860]   No, I agree.
[00:56:03.860 --> 00:56:07.380]   And I think you can make a case that Google is malicious here.
[00:56:07.380 --> 00:56:13.500]   I'm not sure it's as I bring up this alternative point of view to point out that it's not 100
[00:56:13.500 --> 00:56:14.500]   percent clear.
[00:56:14.500 --> 00:56:20.180]   I think that if Google's now, this is my prejudices, if I believe that if this is a
[00:56:20.180 --> 00:56:24.900]   nameless company who is due to this work around this end run against Safari security
[00:56:24.900 --> 00:56:29.140]   features, if they were really on the side of the angels, what they would do is be able
[00:56:29.140 --> 00:56:32.540]   to sense, oh, why can I set this cookie?
[00:56:32.540 --> 00:56:33.700]   Oh, let's do an ID check.
[00:56:33.700 --> 00:56:34.940]   Oh, it's a Safari browser.
[00:56:34.940 --> 00:56:36.580]   We'll just throw up a little notices.
[00:56:36.580 --> 00:56:39.900]   Oh, by the way, we would like to enable this, but we can't because your security settings
[00:56:39.900 --> 00:56:42.260]   are supposed to be the right thing to do.
[00:56:42.260 --> 00:56:46.880]   That would be, I believe that my prejudice is that I believe that someone whose instincts
[00:56:46.880 --> 00:56:49.760]   are to do no harm would choose that option, not great.
[00:56:49.760 --> 00:56:51.920]   Must be a way we can get a rem this somehow.
[00:56:51.920 --> 00:56:53.480]   That would be a good way to do that, actually.
[00:56:53.480 --> 00:56:55.400]   And I do wish Google had done that.
[00:56:55.400 --> 00:56:58.000]   Does Facebook go around it with a like button also?
[00:56:58.000 --> 00:57:04.080]   Yeah, they're also semi tracking people that haven't, if they, whether you signed it or
[00:57:04.080 --> 00:57:06.240]   not, they have a like button.
[00:57:06.240 --> 00:57:07.240]   Yeah.
[00:57:07.240 --> 00:57:12.600]   So any time in order for, so this whole issue third party cooks, by the way, we talk about
[00:57:12.600 --> 00:57:14.320]   third party cookies a lot on security.
[00:57:14.320 --> 00:57:18.800]   Now I have the same debate with Steve, which is I don't, it doesn't bother me.
[00:57:18.800 --> 00:57:22.440]   Third party cookies in general and third party cookies in particular don't bother me.
[00:57:22.440 --> 00:57:27.280]   I like it that there's a setting so that if it bothers somebody, they can turn it off.
[00:57:27.280 --> 00:57:33.800]   It is somewhat how the web works, however, is how ads are served.
[00:57:33.800 --> 00:57:35.840]   It is how the web pays for itself.
[00:57:35.840 --> 00:57:41.800]   Facebook is a, for example, is a free service that monetizes with things like the like button.
[00:57:41.800 --> 00:57:46.280]   Now I acknowledge that I think when you explain what the like button does to people, they
[00:57:46.280 --> 00:57:47.480]   go, what the hell?
[00:57:47.480 --> 00:57:49.360]   You mean every side I go to with a like button?
[00:57:49.360 --> 00:57:52.000]   Facebook knows I was there, whether I'm logged in or not.
[00:57:52.000 --> 00:57:53.360]   That upsets people.
[00:57:53.360 --> 00:57:57.480]   But in fact, if you get the full story, which is, look, you're getting a free service.
[00:57:57.480 --> 00:58:02.560]   They're monetizing, Google's monetizing, by advertising, their goal is not to say, I
[00:58:02.560 --> 00:58:06.960]   want to tell somebody what Leo LePort's up to, but in fact, to get ads served to you
[00:58:06.960 --> 00:58:10.560]   that are more interest to you than just generic ads.
[00:58:10.560 --> 00:58:14.680]   I think that there's, my point is that is a larger argument.
[00:58:14.680 --> 00:58:15.760]   I agree with you, Andy.
[00:58:15.760 --> 00:58:16.760]   It would be great.
[00:58:16.760 --> 00:58:20.040]   And I hope that we're moving to a future where you are notified about all this stuff.
[00:58:20.040 --> 00:58:25.000]   But then we've got the problem where you have notification fatigue, which we once have seen
[00:58:25.000 --> 00:58:30.160]   before on Windows with UAC on Vista, where people just start, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
[00:58:30.160 --> 00:58:32.000]   yeah, yeah.
[00:58:32.000 --> 00:58:36.280]   So I guess, I do agree with you that there is, there does need to be a way so that people
[00:58:36.280 --> 00:58:40.960]   who run commercial sites can get paid for the content that they create that actually
[00:58:40.960 --> 00:58:41.960]   does cost money.
[00:58:41.960 --> 00:58:43.640]   It's not just some dude in his apartment sometimes.
[00:58:43.640 --> 00:58:45.680]   It really is journalism costs money.
[00:58:45.680 --> 00:58:48.440]   I mean, I have to fly to these places to cover these events.
[00:58:48.440 --> 00:58:52.640]   I guess the definitive change would be, I'm thinking about ghostery, for instance, which
[00:58:52.640 --> 00:58:53.640]   is that really great.
[00:58:53.640 --> 00:58:55.560]   The other people out here, that's a plug-in.
[00:58:55.560 --> 00:58:59.680]   It's one thing to not ask before you can deposit cookies.
[00:58:59.680 --> 00:59:02.200]   It's another thing to simply say, oh, this ghostery involved.
[00:59:02.200 --> 00:59:03.320]   Ghostery has been installed.
[00:59:03.320 --> 00:59:04.320]   That's why I can't install it.
[00:59:04.320 --> 00:59:06.480]   That's okay. I know a way around ghostery.
[00:59:06.480 --> 00:59:08.480]   I think that if someone has installed ghostery, they have-
[00:59:08.480 --> 00:59:09.480]   You're right.
[00:59:09.480 --> 00:59:10.480]   That they've really made their apartment with-
[00:59:10.480 --> 00:59:11.480]   That's a clear signal.
[00:59:11.480 --> 00:59:12.480]   Right.
[00:59:12.480 --> 00:59:13.480]   So they're-
[00:59:13.480 --> 00:59:15.800]   I don't think there's such a clear signal from iOS because it was default and Apple did
[00:59:15.800 --> 00:59:20.080]   not make a big deal saying, hey, by the way, we are disabling third-party cookies on your
[00:59:20.080 --> 00:59:21.080]   behalf.
[00:59:21.080 --> 00:59:26.320]   If they had said that, then there'd be no argument.
[00:59:26.320 --> 00:59:30.400]   And if Google had said, hey, by the way, we can't put a plus button on here because
[00:59:30.400 --> 00:59:32.800]   Apple has disabled third-party cookies.
[00:59:32.800 --> 00:59:34.360]   Would you like to re-enable this?
[00:59:34.360 --> 00:59:35.840]   That would then there'd be no argument.
[00:59:35.840 --> 00:59:39.720]   The problem is neither side is really explaining their point of view here.
[00:59:39.720 --> 00:59:43.920]   And for good reason because nobody wants to hear it, it's like more detail than most
[00:59:43.920 --> 00:59:44.920]   people want, right?
[00:59:44.920 --> 00:59:45.920]   Right.
[00:59:45.920 --> 00:59:48.600]   But they do is they give you a very broad setting, which is private browsing.
[00:59:48.600 --> 00:59:49.600]   Right.
[00:59:49.600 --> 00:59:53.840]   So you can flip that on and then you're pretty well set.
[00:59:53.840 --> 00:59:56.200]   But then that disables everything.
[00:59:56.200 --> 00:59:59.360]   So when you return to your favorite website, you go, oh, I have to log in again because
[00:59:59.360 --> 01:00:01.240]   there's no cookie there.
[01:00:01.240 --> 01:00:05.240]   Steve keeps telling me to put no script or script no on my Brad Vreys browsers.
[01:00:05.240 --> 01:00:07.840]   I turn it on for one day and I go, this is a pain in the ass.
[01:00:07.840 --> 01:00:09.800]   And I turn it right off.
[01:00:09.800 --> 01:00:12.000]   You know, the truth is JavaScript is a problem.
[01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:15.160]   And if Apple really wants to protect privacy, what they should do is turn off JavaScript
[01:00:15.160 --> 01:00:18.560]   just as they turned off flash and Safari, then we'd all be safe, but no sites would
[01:00:18.560 --> 01:00:19.560]   work.
[01:00:19.560 --> 01:00:20.560]   That's it.
[01:00:20.560 --> 01:00:21.560]   [MUSIC]
[01:00:21.560 --> 01:00:27.040]   I like Sean, we guess.
[01:00:27.040 --> 01:00:30.960]   He has a good with a turn of the phrase.
[01:00:30.960 --> 01:00:37.360]   The treatment for the blood disease called polysethemia vira, too many red cells goes
[01:00:37.360 --> 01:00:38.880]   back to the dark ages.
[01:00:38.880 --> 01:00:39.880]   Okay.
[01:00:39.880 --> 01:00:43.880]   Now if you're eating breakfast, you might want to just cover your ears.
[01:00:43.880 --> 01:00:47.680]   Lance of vein and relieve the patient of a pint of blood.
[01:00:47.680 --> 01:00:49.960]   Flobotomy treats the symptom, but not the condition.
[01:00:49.960 --> 01:00:50.960]   There's no known cure.
[01:00:50.960 --> 01:00:52.400]   The blood letting must be repeated indefinitely.
[01:00:52.400 --> 01:00:53.920]   This is what comes to mind.
[01:00:53.920 --> 01:00:59.960]   When I see how Apple intends to treat its polycash, e-me, vera, too many greenbacks.
[01:00:59.960 --> 01:01:04.920]   Apple's going to bleed off $45 billion in excess cash through a combination of dividend
[01:01:04.920 --> 01:01:07.960]   payments and through stock repurchase.
[01:01:07.960 --> 01:01:11.600]   But why get rid of the excess cash?
[01:01:11.600 --> 01:01:13.760]   He says, "How dangerous is it and what exactly is excess?"
[01:01:13.760 --> 01:01:20.440]   I encourage you, it's a long and elaborate post, but he talks about the debate on Wall
[01:01:20.440 --> 01:01:22.280]   Street about what to do.
[01:01:22.280 --> 01:01:24.320]   Is it better to keep this cash?
[01:01:24.320 --> 01:01:27.000]   Is it better to get rid of this cash?
[01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:31.080]   Is Apple going to, they say, "We'll replace the cash anyway, just in normal operations."
[01:01:31.080 --> 01:01:32.760]   It isn't going to even cost us anything.
[01:01:32.760 --> 01:01:34.920]   It just keeps us from going over a hundred billion.
[01:01:34.920 --> 01:01:42.040]   Wall Street's fear is that Apple's going to go nuts and buy every company in the universe
[01:01:42.040 --> 01:01:46.600]   and thereby get distracted and waste money and time and energy and all that stuff.
[01:01:46.600 --> 01:01:52.880]   That's a really good thing to be afraid of because Wall Street insider types are among
[01:01:52.880 --> 01:02:00.080]   the only pundit commentators out there who are a little bit more disciplined and realistic
[01:02:00.080 --> 01:02:02.400]   about what acquisitions can give you.
[01:02:02.400 --> 01:02:07.200]   I just wrote a cult of Mac post on this on Saturday, which is essentially saying what
[01:02:07.200 --> 01:02:08.760]   he's saying.
[01:02:08.760 --> 01:02:11.920]   That is that Apple should buy nothing.
[01:02:11.920 --> 01:02:15.760]   I rounded up all of these articles that said Apple should buy Twitter, Apple should buy
[01:02:15.760 --> 01:02:17.440]   Yahoo, Apple should buy Canada.
[01:02:17.440 --> 01:02:18.440]   It was still service.
[01:02:18.440 --> 01:02:21.280]   Yeah, it was just nuts.
[01:02:21.280 --> 01:02:26.880]   Because everybody wants to be Dr. Evil sitting in a lair and spending hundreds of billions,
[01:02:26.880 --> 01:02:29.600]   spending all this money.
[01:02:29.600 --> 01:02:38.680]   Me too, I would make ridiculously bad acquisitions if I were the emperor of Apple.
[01:02:38.680 --> 01:02:41.920]   One of the things that's great about Apple is that they're very disciplined about that.
[01:02:41.920 --> 01:02:45.640]   They make small acquisitions when they buy the technology or the people.
[01:02:45.640 --> 01:02:51.240]   When HP bought Compaq and then HP bought Palm, those were terrible acquisitions.
[01:02:51.240 --> 01:02:54.880]   Hugely wasteful of money, resources.
[01:02:54.880 --> 01:03:01.360]   HP had 900 people working full time on just the acquisition strategy before they bought
[01:03:01.360 --> 01:03:06.160]   Compaq for six, nine months, something like, I mean, just an insane waste of time and money.
[01:03:06.160 --> 01:03:08.960]   And they always say, well, this is going to give us energies and all these wonderful
[01:03:08.960 --> 01:03:10.920]   benefits and those rarely pan out.
[01:03:10.920 --> 01:03:14.800]   So I think time Warner AOL is another one that was just horrible.
[01:03:14.800 --> 01:03:15.800]   Horrible.
[01:03:15.800 --> 01:03:19.560]   Well, I don't think Apple has shown any interest in doing any kind of major murders with anyone
[01:03:19.560 --> 01:03:20.560]   at any point in time.
[01:03:20.560 --> 01:03:21.560]   It shows discipline.
[01:03:21.560 --> 01:03:26.080]   I don't think they need to, trying to integrate what Apple does to most of these companies
[01:03:26.080 --> 01:03:27.080]   will be almost impossible.
[01:03:27.080 --> 01:03:31.560]   It'd be, it's like trying to teach a caveman to drive an F1 racer.
[01:03:31.560 --> 01:03:35.160]   I mean, it's like, you know, because the thing is that these companies, you know, what they
[01:03:35.160 --> 01:03:37.880]   measure and what they think is important and what they build their infrastructure around
[01:03:37.880 --> 01:03:40.920]   is so backwards most of the time.
[01:03:40.920 --> 01:03:42.800]   There's not really any reason for Apple to do that.
[01:03:42.800 --> 01:03:47.320]   And I don't mean that all Apple's approaches are well done, but I mean, it's just a much
[01:03:47.320 --> 01:03:48.600]   more refined system.
[01:03:48.600 --> 01:03:51.400]   And I don't think there's any reason for them to pick those up.
[01:03:51.400 --> 01:03:54.520]   I think that one thing that I think is interesting is if I was Apple and I was going to spend
[01:03:54.520 --> 01:03:57.040]   money, I would just start buying back all the stock until it was all gone.
[01:03:57.040 --> 01:03:59.000]   You know, I don't know why they even put up with these guys.
[01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:01.920]   You know, so that means the thing is that, you know, whether it's, it starts private,
[01:04:01.920 --> 01:04:02.920]   take it private.
[01:04:02.920 --> 01:04:06.200]   $45 billion a year and in 10 years you own the company and you don't have to, and then
[01:04:06.200 --> 01:04:07.480]   there's no more reports.
[01:04:07.480 --> 01:04:08.480]   There's no more.
[01:04:08.480 --> 01:04:09.480]   There's a lot less of issue.
[01:04:09.480 --> 01:04:10.960]   I would think that would be a desirable thing.
[01:04:10.960 --> 01:04:11.960]   You want to get rid of cash.
[01:04:11.960 --> 01:04:16.120]   Except that you do want stock options publicly traded stock options to reward employees.
[01:04:16.120 --> 01:04:19.760]   I think that's the only reason that a company like Apple would want to be public.
[01:04:19.760 --> 01:04:20.760]   Why?
[01:04:20.760 --> 01:04:21.760]   There's other ways they can reward them.
[01:04:21.760 --> 01:04:25.120]   And the SEC requirements, although we have this new jobs bill that apparently is changing
[01:04:25.120 --> 01:04:29.800]   that requirement a little bit, but not enough probably to get Apple out of the requirement
[01:04:29.800 --> 01:04:31.120]   to be public.
[01:04:31.120 --> 01:04:32.680]   It was a 500.
[01:04:32.680 --> 01:04:35.480]   If you have 500 investors, you have to go public.
[01:04:35.480 --> 01:04:38.920]   And I think they've raised that number or about to raise that number to a thousand or
[01:04:38.920 --> 01:04:39.920]   more.
[01:04:39.920 --> 01:04:40.920]   Look at Apple stock price though.
[01:04:40.920 --> 01:04:46.440]   Stock market likes it record high today of $615.48.
[01:04:46.440 --> 01:04:48.280]   It's a little bit off that peak.
[01:04:48.280 --> 01:04:49.960]   Just going up.
[01:04:49.960 --> 01:04:54.200]   It's almost eight bucks up today.
[01:04:54.200 --> 01:04:55.200]   Today.
[01:04:55.200 --> 01:04:56.200]   Yeah.
[01:04:56.200 --> 01:05:00.200]   One share of Apple stock costs more than a 32 gigabyte.
[01:05:00.200 --> 01:05:03.000]   That's the new metric.
[01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:06.960]   We now say how long will it be until we can get a MacBook Air for the price of one share
[01:05:06.960 --> 01:05:07.960]   of Apple stock?
[01:05:07.960 --> 01:05:10.520]   Not long I think at this rate.
[01:05:10.520 --> 01:05:12.840]   It does make you wonder all these.
[01:05:12.840 --> 01:05:15.960]   I've been reading financial reports for the past couple of weeks that keep saying, well,
[01:05:15.960 --> 01:05:18.760]   if they continue on this tech, they continue making.
[01:05:18.760 --> 01:05:23.640]   It's almost impossible for Apple to bleed off as much money as the more money than they're
[01:05:23.640 --> 01:05:25.480]   actually taking in.
[01:05:25.480 --> 01:05:27.200]   And I haven't seen a good answer to the question.
[01:05:27.200 --> 01:05:33.560]   Well, what if this is a really good, Apple is truly at a right place, right time, right
[01:05:33.560 --> 01:05:37.840]   product sort of situation where right now they have some of the hottest selling products
[01:05:37.840 --> 01:05:38.840]   in the market.
[01:05:38.840 --> 01:05:41.960]   Right now they still have the iPad market completely to itself.
[01:05:41.960 --> 01:05:45.680]   What happens when a year from now, two years from now, other companies finally figure out
[01:05:45.680 --> 01:05:50.160]   how to make a $400 tablet that actually works extremely well.
[01:05:50.160 --> 01:05:54.080]   Well, that's why Apple is the new product is everything.
[01:05:54.080 --> 01:06:01.640]   So the new product is iCloud supporting Mac's MacBook Pros, MacBook Airs, iPads, phones,
[01:06:01.640 --> 01:06:02.640]   everything.
[01:06:02.640 --> 01:06:09.400]   So even if Samsung came out with a superior tablet to the iPad, it wouldn't be part of
[01:06:09.400 --> 01:06:11.160]   your sort of ecosystem.
[01:06:11.160 --> 01:06:16.120]   If you're like I am, which is, you know, you have Apple TV, you have everything, it still
[01:06:16.120 --> 01:06:18.000]   wouldn't be better.
[01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:23.600]   But as iCloud, such an intensively good value add, I know you're just making one example.
[01:06:23.600 --> 01:06:24.960]   That's not the whole argument.
[01:06:24.960 --> 01:06:30.600]   But is Apple ever going to be able to make anything again that is so uniquely the only
[01:06:30.600 --> 01:06:35.040]   thing you can get that will be as good as anything else that we can be coming out with.
[01:06:35.040 --> 01:06:36.960]   Once they come up the tablet, what's next after that?
[01:06:36.960 --> 01:06:38.840]   It's the TV going to be that next thing.
[01:06:38.840 --> 01:06:43.200]   I saw, I've seen that last week was in the first time that I think what you guys say
[01:06:43.200 --> 01:06:46.440]   who was talking about a friend of his suggesting that maybe Apple's going to revolutionize
[01:06:46.440 --> 01:06:48.160]   cameras next.
[01:06:48.160 --> 01:06:53.240]   And I'm just keep thinking, I keep wondering where is the, are they approaching the ceiling
[01:06:53.240 --> 01:06:58.160]   of innovation where there's a limit to how many revolutions they can accomplish in a
[01:06:58.160 --> 01:06:59.160]   five year period?
[01:06:59.160 --> 01:07:00.800]   Cars, that's all I'm saying.
[01:07:00.800 --> 01:07:01.800]   Cars.
[01:07:01.800 --> 01:07:03.000]   All right, I'm going to tell you what Apple should do.
[01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:04.000]   Because it's very simple.
[01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:05.200]   It's very obvious.
[01:07:05.200 --> 01:07:12.280]   First of all, there is some threat, you know, that they'll lose their hegemony in the iPad
[01:07:12.280 --> 01:07:15.200]   market, but Apple's very good at coming up with new products.
[01:07:15.200 --> 01:07:17.120]   They don't put very much of their money into R&D.
[01:07:17.120 --> 01:07:21.080]   In fact, they kind of put a notoriously small amount compared to other similar companies
[01:07:21.080 --> 01:07:22.080]   into R&D.
[01:07:22.080 --> 01:07:23.520]   Put a little more in R&D.
[01:07:23.520 --> 01:07:26.600]   If I were Apple, I'd want to control my supply chain a little bit better.
[01:07:26.600 --> 01:07:31.560]   They are, for instance, very dependent on Samsung for every single display right now
[01:07:31.560 --> 01:07:32.560]   in the iPad.
[01:07:32.560 --> 01:07:34.160]   LG's ramping up.
[01:07:34.160 --> 01:07:39.520]   Apple should start, I think, from a business point of view, should really start maybe building
[01:07:39.520 --> 01:07:42.360]   their own supply chain because they don't control it.
[01:07:42.360 --> 01:07:43.360]   And that is a real risk.
[01:07:43.360 --> 01:07:47.000]   And it's why they couldn't make enough iPads in years past.
[01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:48.240]   So that's one.
[01:07:48.240 --> 01:07:54.280]   The other thing that I think Apple probably could spend its money on, let's see, I had
[01:07:54.280 --> 01:07:55.280]   two things.
[01:07:55.280 --> 01:08:00.120]   Oh, that I would like to see them spend their money on that they won't is moving manufacture
[01:08:00.120 --> 01:08:02.240]   back to the US.
[01:08:02.240 --> 01:08:04.480]   And that could tie into controlling the supply chain.
[01:08:04.480 --> 01:08:08.520]   We've already seen studies that say it costs 60 bucks more for an iPhone if you made it
[01:08:08.520 --> 01:08:09.520]   in the US.
[01:08:09.520 --> 01:08:11.600]   It's not a huge significant increase.
[01:08:11.600 --> 01:08:15.800]   And I think it would be very good public relations for the company to just say, you
[01:08:15.800 --> 01:08:16.800]   know what?
[01:08:16.800 --> 01:08:17.800]   You're right.
[01:08:17.800 --> 01:08:19.920]   We used to make everything in the US.
[01:08:19.920 --> 01:08:21.400]   American workers are the best workers in the world.
[01:08:21.400 --> 01:08:23.560]   We want to make the best products in the world.
[01:08:23.560 --> 01:08:24.720]   We want to make quality.
[01:08:24.720 --> 01:08:26.200]   We're going to go upstream.
[01:08:26.200 --> 01:08:30.280]   Everybody else in the tech industry is making them in China, making them in Thailand, making
[01:08:30.280 --> 01:08:31.360]   them in Korea, making them in Brazil.
[01:08:31.360 --> 01:08:33.000]   We're going to move it all here to the US.
[01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:34.000]   That's what I'd spend the money on.
[01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:40.760]   It'd be very good for business, I think.
[01:08:40.760 --> 01:08:45.960]   Apple has this now I was a little head up over this, but I'm going to give you guys a
[01:08:45.960 --> 01:08:47.920]   chance to defend Apple over this.
[01:08:47.920 --> 01:08:54.000]   A California district judge on Friday granted Apple an injunction against the Samsung Galaxy
[01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:55.000]   Nexus.
[01:08:55.000 --> 01:09:00.480]   This is the most recent Google experience phone, which makes it significant, by the way.
[01:09:00.480 --> 01:09:01.480]   It is not.
[01:09:01.480 --> 01:09:04.640]   And I'm sure this is why Apple picked this as a target.
[01:09:04.640 --> 01:09:06.800]   It is not modified in any way by carriers.
[01:09:06.800 --> 01:09:11.360]   This is the Google experience or by manufacturers.
[01:09:11.360 --> 01:09:14.240]   It's also the first phone running ice cream sandwich.
[01:09:14.240 --> 01:09:22.560]   The judge found that it likely infringes on all four patents cited by Cupertino.
[01:09:22.560 --> 01:09:29.880]   But the judge specifically singled out 604, which is called the Siri patent.
[01:09:29.880 --> 01:09:34.920]   There was slide to unlock what Florian Mueller calls data tapping.
[01:09:34.920 --> 01:09:36.800]   And I still don't understand what it does.
[01:09:36.800 --> 01:09:40.680]   And basically auto correct where it suggests responses.
[01:09:40.680 --> 01:09:50.280]   But the judge co said the one she was most convinced by is the patent that says when
[01:09:50.280 --> 01:09:55.840]   you do a search, go out, look at a lot of different sources and put the results back
[01:09:55.840 --> 01:10:00.000]   into a single unified page for the user.
[01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:01.000]   That's the Siri patent.
[01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:03.400]   And of course, I don't know exactly.
[01:10:03.400 --> 01:10:06.520]   I haven't looked at the complaint, but exactly where in the Nexus phone they're talking about.
[01:10:06.520 --> 01:10:10.600]   But I would guess it's the Google voice search feature, which is very much like Siri where
[01:10:10.600 --> 01:10:12.200]   you'll search for something.
[01:10:12.200 --> 01:10:16.000]   And I presume it brings back Yelp and location and other stuff.
[01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:17.840]   What do you think, Andy?
[01:10:17.840 --> 01:10:18.840]   This is all pretty gross.
[01:10:18.840 --> 01:10:23.880]   When you look at the actual patents that are being actioned on, they're so broad that
[01:10:23.880 --> 01:10:28.800]   half of two of these things, I can tell you that I've actually written in code myself
[01:10:28.800 --> 01:10:33.040]   as any time in the past 20 years because they're just that basic.
[01:10:33.040 --> 01:10:38.200]   If they're the thing that you're confused about is something that I think on Apple,
[01:10:38.200 --> 01:10:39.960]   it's actually called data detectors.
[01:10:39.960 --> 01:10:42.200]   This is the data tapping thing.
[01:10:42.200 --> 01:10:43.200]   Data tapping.
[01:10:43.200 --> 01:10:45.800]   It's essentially the idea that if someone sends you an email that says, oh, that's cool,
[01:10:45.800 --> 01:10:46.800]   I'll be in town.
[01:10:46.800 --> 01:10:48.800]   If you need to get in touch with me, here's my phone number.
[01:10:48.800 --> 01:10:50.680]   That's the ability to detect that sequence.
[01:10:50.680 --> 01:10:51.680]   Right.
[01:10:51.680 --> 01:10:56.640]   To turn that into a tap that turns into an actual voice call.
[01:10:56.640 --> 01:11:01.880]   But I mean, is that really so complicated that it is Apple's sole property?
[01:11:01.880 --> 01:11:03.880]   The patent for Siri.
[01:11:03.880 --> 01:11:11.080]   The first time that I was looking at these problems, I'm trying to get activated here,
[01:11:11.080 --> 01:11:15.400]   here is like the Samsung Galaxy 3 version of Siri.
[01:11:15.400 --> 01:11:17.440]   And as you can see, it looks almost identical.
[01:11:17.440 --> 01:11:18.440]   Yeah.
[01:11:18.440 --> 01:11:19.440]   Was that part of the problem?
[01:11:19.440 --> 01:11:23.680]   No, no, no, the problem is the patent is not the patent.
[01:11:23.680 --> 01:11:26.040]   The patent is, yeah, see, here it is.
[01:11:26.040 --> 01:11:29.080]   As I was talking, it said, I'm sorry, I don't understand.
[01:11:29.080 --> 01:11:30.480]   What is the real deep?
[01:11:30.480 --> 01:11:31.480]   Do you want to search the web?
[01:11:31.480 --> 01:11:33.280]   It is really exactly like Siri.
[01:11:33.280 --> 01:11:36.120]   But that's not the nature of their complaint.
[01:11:36.120 --> 01:11:41.680]   The nature of their complaint is that the tran-mogrification of the phrase, what's the
[01:11:41.680 --> 01:11:46.000]   weather like out there to a search of a weather page on the internet?
[01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:48.760]   And then a search of-
[01:11:48.760 --> 01:11:50.760]   God dang it.
[01:11:50.760 --> 01:11:52.760]   Siri, here, I can do it here.
[01:11:52.760 --> 01:11:53.760]   Let me try it.
[01:11:53.760 --> 01:11:55.960]   Chad, do you have an over the shoulder for me?
[01:11:55.960 --> 01:11:56.960]   No, no, it's-
[01:11:56.960 --> 01:11:59.240]   What's the weather like out there?
[01:11:59.240 --> 01:12:00.240]   I'm just curious.
[01:12:00.240 --> 01:12:01.240]   The nature of the-
[01:12:01.240 --> 01:12:08.020]   Unfortunately, I put- I placed the phone down on the MacBook that I use to control the
[01:12:08.020 --> 01:12:09.020]   chat.
[01:12:09.020 --> 01:12:10.020]   And so, ooh, I see a magnet.
[01:12:10.020 --> 01:12:11.020]   I bet the lid is closed.
[01:12:11.020 --> 01:12:13.640]   I'm just trying to go into sleep now.
[01:12:13.640 --> 01:12:14.640]   More Apple innovation.
[01:12:14.640 --> 01:12:16.440]   I don't think it's credible interest like that.
[01:12:16.440 --> 01:12:17.600]   I see a magnet.
[01:12:17.600 --> 01:12:18.600]   So it did-
[01:12:18.600 --> 01:12:19.600]   This is a debate.
[01:12:19.600 --> 01:12:20.600]   I just did that, though.
[01:12:20.600 --> 01:12:21.600]   I said, what's the weather out there?
[01:12:21.600 --> 01:12:23.240]   And this is the Samsung version.
[01:12:23.240 --> 01:12:24.320]   This is not Google Voice.
[01:12:24.320 --> 01:12:25.720]   This is a Samsung version.
[01:12:25.720 --> 01:12:28.400]   Now the Nexus does something similar with ice cream sandwich.
[01:12:28.400 --> 01:12:30.760]   And then it gave me the weather for a very nice presentation.
[01:12:30.760 --> 01:12:32.240]   Yeah, shoot.
[01:12:32.240 --> 01:12:34.960]   Uh-oh, you've muted now.
[01:12:34.960 --> 01:12:37.480]   I don't know what magnet you've got there, but you've now muted yourself.
[01:12:37.480 --> 01:12:38.480]   I'm taking it off now.
[01:12:38.480 --> 01:12:39.480]   Okay.
[01:12:39.480 --> 01:12:42.480]   There you go.
[01:12:42.480 --> 01:12:43.480]   Sorry about that.
[01:12:43.480 --> 01:12:44.480]   I hate it when that happens.
[01:12:44.480 --> 01:12:46.260]   You know, you get everything set up just right.
[01:12:46.260 --> 01:12:47.260]   And then-
[01:12:47.260 --> 01:12:52.680]   I'm actually a few weeks away from like actually- it's been like a couple of years
[01:12:52.680 --> 01:12:53.980]   since I set up the studio.
[01:12:53.980 --> 01:12:58.740]   I'm now a few weeks away from truly like moving everything out and rebuilding everything,
[01:12:58.740 --> 01:13:00.140]   like so it makes sense now.
[01:13:00.140 --> 01:13:03.420]   And I think that just told me that I'm going to have to put like something over this keyboard
[01:13:03.420 --> 01:13:05.300]   to keep myself from doing that.
[01:13:05.300 --> 01:13:08.300]   But to get back to the point.
[01:13:08.300 --> 01:13:12.560]   Their patent on that they're using for this is just the idea of saying what's the weather
[01:13:12.560 --> 01:13:17.320]   and turning that into a search result specifically for weather that returns search results.
[01:13:17.320 --> 01:13:21.680]   And that's another thing that anybody could tell you that they've written code like that
[01:13:21.680 --> 01:13:23.360]   in the past 20 to 25 years.
[01:13:23.360 --> 01:13:26.120]   It's just absolutely silly.
[01:13:26.120 --> 01:13:30.200]   And it's just so broad that believe it or not, I mean, Apple also tried to get injunction
[01:13:30.200 --> 01:13:35.160]   against the, the Galaxy 3, a Galaxy S3 from Samsung.
[01:13:35.160 --> 01:13:39.800]   And the reason why the judge turned that down wasn't because it was only because that Apple
[01:13:39.800 --> 01:13:43.620]   had asked, made so many requests of that judge that she just didn't have time on the honor
[01:13:43.620 --> 01:13:44.820]   docket for it.
[01:13:44.820 --> 01:13:47.660]   So right now this is a very popular phone that a lot of people are very, very happy
[01:13:47.660 --> 01:13:52.300]   with and are saying that myself including that this is pretty much as good as an iPhone.
[01:13:52.300 --> 01:13:54.340]   It's just different strengths and different weaknesses.
[01:13:54.340 --> 01:13:58.860]   This would not be on the market if not for the fact that there just wasn't time nowhere
[01:13:58.860 --> 01:14:00.380]   for Apple to block it.
[01:14:00.380 --> 01:14:05.800]   And it just makes, it just gets me really disappointed because I was thinking about this this morning
[01:14:05.800 --> 01:14:10.480]   that this is not the act of a greater nation.
[01:14:10.480 --> 01:14:11.960]   This is the act of a lesser nation.
[01:14:11.960 --> 01:14:15.260]   This is the act of a nation of a society in decline.
[01:14:15.260 --> 01:14:18.460]   I'm not saying that this is a sign that Apple's going down and I'm predicting Apple's going
[01:14:18.460 --> 01:14:19.460]   down.
[01:14:19.460 --> 01:14:23.760]   I'm simply saying that when you look at the things that make you think that a company has
[01:14:23.760 --> 01:14:28.580]   it all together, suing other companies into not making competing products based on what
[01:14:28.580 --> 01:14:36.900]   appear to be very flimsy excuses is not that thing.
[01:14:36.900 --> 01:14:41.060]   Andy and I were on Trey Radcliffe's Variety Hour, Trey's Variety Hour last night talking
[01:14:41.060 --> 01:14:45.020]   about among other things iPad photography.
[01:14:45.020 --> 01:14:50.380]   And I think Andy thinks I'm nuts but I love the camera in the new iPad so much.
[01:14:50.380 --> 01:14:53.060]   That's how I took that picture by the way of the Ford.
[01:14:53.060 --> 01:14:59.260]   But I've been using it for everything lately and I'm just a huge fan.
[01:14:59.260 --> 01:15:01.900]   I got to admit that I have two problems with it.
[01:15:01.900 --> 01:15:08.300]   I might have been turned around on it slightly this morning because I was out to breakfast.
[01:15:08.300 --> 01:15:15.060]   I was ordering a waffles and the idea of taking pictures and seeing like an eight-bit.
[01:15:15.060 --> 01:15:16.060]   Yeah, baby.
[01:15:16.060 --> 01:15:17.060]   Yeah, baby.
[01:15:17.060 --> 01:15:18.060]   Pretty cool.
[01:15:18.060 --> 01:15:23.780]   As a matter of fact, this kind of looked better even because it was, makes me hungry at the
[01:15:23.780 --> 01:15:26.700]   actual waffles.
[01:15:26.700 --> 01:15:30.740]   My problem is that number one, there is no way to take pictures like this and not look
[01:15:30.740 --> 01:15:35.420]   like the biggest dork in Stein.
[01:15:35.420 --> 01:15:40.980]   Secondly, there's the problems of like using, there are inherent problems always with using
[01:15:40.980 --> 01:15:42.980]   the iPad and bright sunlight.
[01:15:42.980 --> 01:15:45.980]   And so that means that when I was taking test pictures over the weekend, it was a nice
[01:15:45.980 --> 01:15:49.660]   bright sunny day, which meant that there's so much glare coming off of this huge piece
[01:15:49.660 --> 01:15:53.180]   of polished glass that I really couldn't see what I was aiming at.
[01:15:53.180 --> 01:15:54.900]   Also the sun was washing up green.
[01:15:54.900 --> 01:15:58.300]   So again, really couldn't see what I was aiming at.
[01:15:58.300 --> 01:16:03.820]   And thirdly, when I'm taking the, it seems as though it's in many ways the worst of both
[01:16:03.820 --> 01:16:08.220]   worlds where if I really want to go out and take good pictures, I'll have my real camera
[01:16:08.220 --> 01:16:11.620]   with me and it takes incredibly good pictures.
[01:16:11.620 --> 01:16:15.340]   It's inconvenient because I have to like, you know, carry it around a strap, but it takes
[01:16:15.340 --> 01:16:16.580]   great pictures.
[01:16:16.580 --> 01:16:21.540]   If I'm just taking casual pictures, I use my phone and that's great because I can just
[01:16:21.540 --> 01:16:25.620]   simply carry it in my pocket, take it out, take a picture, then put it back in my pocket.
[01:16:25.620 --> 01:16:29.940]   With the iPad, I've got not great picture taking or at least not great compared to a
[01:16:29.940 --> 01:16:33.860]   real camera and I've got all the convenience of this big bulky thing unless I want to walk
[01:16:33.860 --> 01:16:39.620]   around with this big like $500, $800 object that screams to people, "Hi, can you grab
[01:16:39.620 --> 01:16:40.940]   this and run faster than me?
[01:16:40.940 --> 01:16:42.340]   Have a free iPad."
[01:16:42.340 --> 01:16:50.060]   Well, one thing I do is you see my case is a sun hood because I have a case with a lid.
[01:16:50.060 --> 01:16:53.060]   So in order to take the picture, if you fold the lid over, it covers the camera.
[01:16:53.060 --> 01:16:55.220]   So in order to make sure you have to do it this way.
[01:16:55.220 --> 01:16:58.900]   And as it turns out, it really does block the glare very nicely.
[01:16:58.900 --> 01:17:04.780]   In fact, Alan Tepper, the Pro Video Coalition magazine and website wrote an article saying,
[01:17:04.780 --> 01:17:08.780]   this is the new 4x5 view camera because remember in the old days of photographers they've
[01:17:08.780 --> 01:17:10.580]   had a hood over their head?
[01:17:10.580 --> 01:17:14.180]   Yeah, the 6-star project wanted to sell that eclipse on magnetically.
[01:17:14.180 --> 01:17:15.180]   Yes.
[01:17:15.180 --> 01:17:16.180]   Ready cosplay.
[01:17:16.180 --> 01:17:17.180]   Yes.
[01:17:17.180 --> 01:17:18.180]   Let's see.
[01:17:18.180 --> 01:17:19.180]   Let's see.
[01:17:19.180 --> 01:17:20.180]   I think you kind of proved me my point.
[01:17:20.180 --> 01:17:21.180]   You're not looking.
[01:17:21.180 --> 01:17:23.940]   I don't care.
[01:17:23.940 --> 01:17:24.940]   Look at this picture.
[01:17:24.940 --> 01:17:27.620]   This is a, so it's also the camera you have, right?
[01:17:27.620 --> 01:17:31.780]   So there was a bunny out by the truck the other day.
[01:17:31.780 --> 01:17:32.780]   Not my truck, of course.
[01:17:32.780 --> 01:17:34.220]   Mine would be a Ford F-150.
[01:17:34.220 --> 01:17:42.060]   I said that cute bunny and I didn't have my Canon 5D Mark II with a telephoto lens, which
[01:17:42.060 --> 01:17:43.060]   I would have liked.
[01:17:43.060 --> 01:17:44.500]   I only had my iPad.
[01:17:44.500 --> 01:17:47.740]   But I think I snapped a pretty great little shot there.
[01:17:47.740 --> 01:17:49.980]   That's filtered a little bit with Instagram.
[01:17:49.980 --> 01:17:50.980]   It's not with the original.
[01:17:50.980 --> 01:17:53.980]   Actually, it was not, was a little bit more natural color.
[01:17:53.980 --> 01:17:54.980]   The color is very good.
[01:17:54.980 --> 01:17:56.220]   The clarity is very good.
[01:17:56.220 --> 01:17:59.300]   You know, it doesn't have, it's not wide angle or zoom.
[01:17:59.300 --> 01:18:03.340]   So you miss out on, you know, it's like having a fixed prime lens.
[01:18:03.340 --> 01:18:06.940]   By the way, the bunny tasted fabulous just before asking.
[01:18:06.940 --> 01:18:08.340]   A little bit like chicken.
[01:18:08.340 --> 01:18:09.340]   Yeah.
[01:18:09.340 --> 01:18:15.820]   It takes pictures that are about as good as the iPhone 4, the 5 megapixel camera.
[01:18:15.820 --> 01:18:20.780]   It's just that I'm going to have like my real iPhone 4 with me.
[01:18:20.780 --> 01:18:25.340]   So that's probably, it's a much better camera I think for shooting video than anything else
[01:18:25.340 --> 01:18:29.020]   because that's when you're shooting video, you are just standing, you're not taking out
[01:18:29.020 --> 01:18:31.700]   a video camera, snapping a second video and putting it back in.
[01:18:31.700 --> 01:18:34.540]   You really are just actually actively shooting.
[01:18:34.540 --> 01:18:39.020]   And when you, this video and you don't have to import it, you don't have to do anything
[01:18:39.020 --> 01:18:43.140]   to it is just there and I movie can start editing it immediately.
[01:18:43.140 --> 01:18:44.140]   That's pretty hot.
[01:18:44.140 --> 01:18:45.140]   I agree.
[01:18:45.140 --> 01:18:49.540]   That's one of the reasons I like it even for stills is I've got iPhoto which I'm starting
[01:18:49.540 --> 01:18:53.300]   to really like, tough learning curve, but I'm starting to get it.
[01:18:53.300 --> 01:18:54.940]   And I can upload it immediately.
[01:18:54.940 --> 01:18:57.340]   Even, you know, I got 3G so even out in the field.
[01:18:57.340 --> 01:19:03.100]   I like to me photography has become much more of a social thing thanks to Instagram and
[01:19:03.100 --> 01:19:05.220]   Facebook and path.
[01:19:05.220 --> 01:19:10.180]   I don't take pictures just for the real or the role or to, you know, for my album.
[01:19:10.180 --> 01:19:12.700]   I take them to post them almost always.
[01:19:12.700 --> 01:19:16.340]   Very rarely do I take them and not post them.
[01:19:16.340 --> 01:19:17.420]   Those are only the butt pictures.
[01:19:17.420 --> 01:19:18.420]   I save those.
[01:19:18.420 --> 01:19:21.420]   I could have gone my entire life.
[01:19:21.420 --> 01:19:22.420]   I know.
[01:19:22.420 --> 01:19:23.420]   I'm sorry, Rich.
[01:19:23.420 --> 01:19:25.020]   I'm really, I apologize.
[01:19:25.020 --> 01:19:28.460]   I blame myself.
[01:19:28.460 --> 01:19:31.540]   Did you get 18T of a rise in Rich?
[01:19:31.540 --> 01:19:36.540]   I actually got a Wi-Fi only iPad, but my iPhone is an 18T iPhone.
[01:19:36.540 --> 01:19:38.260]   And you use that as a hotspot then?
[01:19:38.260 --> 01:19:40.540]   Is that why you didn't feel the need?
[01:19:40.540 --> 01:19:47.020]   No, it's just that for the way I operate nowadays, I find that whenever I'm out and
[01:19:47.020 --> 01:19:52.740]   about, if I have my iPad, I tend to be someplace where there's Wi-Fi.
[01:19:52.740 --> 01:19:56.340]   I went back and forth on that and I ended up because it's a company iPad.
[01:19:56.340 --> 01:19:58.340]   So I said, well, I'm going to buy it.
[01:19:58.340 --> 01:19:59.540]   But I think you probably could.
[01:19:59.540 --> 01:20:01.940]   Nowadays, everybody's around Wi-Fi almost all the time.
[01:20:01.940 --> 01:20:04.340]   You lose the GPS.
[01:20:04.340 --> 01:20:05.660]   Maybe that's not an issue.
[01:20:05.660 --> 01:20:06.660]   Which I haven't missed.
[01:20:06.660 --> 01:20:08.260]   Plus, you know, I do have the iPhone.
[01:20:08.260 --> 01:20:12.820]   So if I'm someplace where there's no Wi-Fi, I'll fire up the iPhone and do what I need
[01:20:12.820 --> 01:20:14.540]   to do.
[01:20:14.540 --> 01:20:20.380]   That said, I did have a couple of second thoughts about, did I make the right decision
[01:20:20.380 --> 01:20:22.740]   not getting the 4G on the iPad?
[01:20:22.740 --> 01:20:32.100]   And I'm thinking probably for now, eventually, maybe my next iPad will be a 4G iPad.
[01:20:32.100 --> 01:20:33.780]   But I think so far so good.
[01:20:33.780 --> 01:20:39.380]   People who have Verizon LTE are reporting astounding speeds, like 50 megabits down,
[01:20:39.380 --> 01:20:42.300]   15 megabits up.
[01:20:42.300 --> 01:20:43.300]   I don't know.
[01:20:43.300 --> 01:20:45.060]   I mean, it's almost overkill.
[01:20:45.060 --> 01:20:47.580]   It's not like you download giant applications.
[01:20:47.580 --> 01:20:48.580]   Huh?
[01:20:48.580 --> 01:20:49.580]   Yeah.
[01:20:49.580 --> 01:20:51.620]   I'm putting that actually 5.0 or 15.
[01:20:51.620 --> 01:20:53.820]   5.0 down, both 5.0 down.
[01:20:53.820 --> 01:20:56.500]   MGC, the report of that in San Francisco.
[01:20:56.500 --> 01:21:00.740]   And somebody just mentioned it that his friend in Portland is getting 50 down, 49 megabits
[01:21:00.740 --> 01:21:01.740]   down.
[01:21:01.740 --> 01:21:02.740]   Oh, wait.
[01:21:02.740 --> 01:21:04.380]   See, now that's my fireless connection right there.
[01:21:04.380 --> 01:21:05.380]   Exactly.
[01:21:05.380 --> 01:21:10.380]   But on the other hand, if you only buy 3 gigabytes a month, you're going to go through that
[01:21:10.380 --> 01:21:11.380]   like a split.
[01:21:11.380 --> 01:21:15.180]   Well, but still, that will only come into play if you're doing lots of streaming.
[01:21:15.180 --> 01:21:16.180]   Right.
[01:21:16.180 --> 01:21:20.380]   But if you're still a typical user, you're still going to be getting pictures just the
[01:21:20.380 --> 01:21:23.260]   same transaction only will get it faster.
[01:21:23.260 --> 01:21:26.100]   But this is the reason why that's a good one.
[01:21:26.100 --> 01:21:32.460]   When I buy my iPad 3, it is going to be an LTE model because there's something about
[01:21:32.460 --> 01:21:38.780]   a tablet computer that to have an implicit connection to the internet really does change
[01:21:38.780 --> 01:21:39.780]   the device.
[01:21:39.780 --> 01:21:45.140]   Even if you just have to wait exactly 10 seconds to log into a public Wi-Fi, that really does
[01:21:45.140 --> 01:21:47.140]   change the experience a little bit.
[01:21:47.140 --> 01:21:52.940]   Also, I'm so aware that there's so many times when I just can't find Wi-Fi or good public
[01:21:52.940 --> 01:22:00.540]   Wi-Fi, I have to say that unfortunately, the Panera up the street has lost its license
[01:22:00.540 --> 01:22:05.580]   as a venue for my working out of the house because not only is the Wi-Fi terrible, even
[01:22:05.580 --> 01:22:12.740]   the HSPA Plus on the AT&T mode without LTE is faster than its own Wi-Fi.
[01:22:12.740 --> 01:22:16.940]   And then they increased the price with soda by 15 cents.
[01:22:16.940 --> 01:22:22.660]   But now that I have a 4G iPad though, now if I want to, I can work at the Chipotle.
[01:22:22.660 --> 01:22:26.220]   I can work at the Dunkin Donuts with the terrible Wi-Fi.
[01:22:26.220 --> 01:22:27.220]   It doesn't matter.
[01:22:27.220 --> 01:22:29.140]   Oh, you don't mean get a job at the Chipotle.
[01:22:29.140 --> 01:22:30.620]   Things aren't that tough.
[01:22:30.620 --> 01:22:32.020]   You meant I can get work done.
[01:22:32.020 --> 01:22:36.420]   It's a great franchise.
[01:22:36.420 --> 01:22:38.460]   You know, it really depends on your use case.
[01:22:38.460 --> 01:22:44.620]   So Rich may only go to the same two places all the time and they both have good Wi-Fi.
[01:22:44.620 --> 01:22:46.620]   The bar and my study.
[01:22:46.620 --> 01:22:47.620]   Exactly.
[01:22:47.620 --> 01:22:49.980]   He works at homes.
[01:22:49.980 --> 01:22:56.060]   But if you spend time at airports, random airports across the country or you're on construction
[01:22:56.060 --> 01:22:59.420]   sites or whatever, and you need access, I could see it.
[01:22:59.420 --> 01:23:03.020]   I mean, what's good is we're getting great performance.
[01:23:03.020 --> 01:23:07.980]   Even the AT&T model, I was getting the highest I got was about 12 megabits.
[01:23:07.980 --> 01:23:09.340]   On average, it was about seven or eight.
[01:23:09.340 --> 01:23:12.100]   That's what I reported in my review.
[01:23:12.100 --> 01:23:14.340]   But yeah, it's not a trivial upgrade.
[01:23:14.340 --> 01:23:15.340]   No, amazing.
[01:23:15.340 --> 01:23:18.260]   How's battery life when you're using LTE?
[01:23:18.260 --> 01:23:22.300]   People are reporting about one hour, less nine hours.
[01:23:22.300 --> 01:23:23.460]   It's constant.
[01:23:23.460 --> 01:23:25.660]   It's commensurate with what you get on 3G.
[01:23:25.660 --> 01:23:32.660]   So if I'm using LTE exclusively, it was burning at about 30 to 40 percent faster than it would
[01:23:32.660 --> 01:23:35.340]   without LTE.
[01:23:35.340 --> 01:23:39.780]   It's not, which is just a little bit higher than what I'm experiencing when I'm just doing
[01:23:39.780 --> 01:23:41.500]   nothing but 3G.
[01:23:41.500 --> 01:23:45.820]   So all in all, I would say the battery life is about the same as what you get on the iPad
[01:23:45.820 --> 01:23:46.820]   2.
[01:23:46.820 --> 01:23:52.060]   LTE does burn battery faster than 3G, but not so much that you would want to not use it.
[01:23:52.060 --> 01:23:56.940]   And so that means that Wi-Fi iPads like riches are getting even more battery life than the
[01:23:56.940 --> 01:23:58.140]   previous year.
[01:23:58.140 --> 01:23:59.900]   It's modern.
[01:23:59.900 --> 01:24:01.860]   Not that you would actually feel it.
[01:24:01.860 --> 01:24:07.380]   I would say that most of the power is being sucked up by the screen.
[01:24:07.380 --> 01:24:12.580]   Unfortunately, I do have to say that I don't have like real benchmarks going here at the
[01:24:12.580 --> 01:24:14.100]   office when I test out battery life.
[01:24:14.100 --> 01:24:18.580]   It's more like I take a note of what the battery status was when I started working exclusively
[01:24:18.580 --> 01:24:22.820]   LTE, then take a note of what it was before I compared to what I was getting a couple
[01:24:22.820 --> 01:24:23.820]   of years ago.
[01:24:23.820 --> 01:24:26.340]   So I do think that the LTE was burning a little bit faster.
[01:24:26.340 --> 01:24:32.700]   I have also been trying it without any 3G, without any 4G, without any LTE.
[01:24:32.700 --> 01:24:37.580]   And when I'm watching a movie, for instance, movie watching is almost exactly the same amount
[01:24:37.580 --> 01:24:39.140]   of battery life as previous.
[01:24:39.140 --> 01:24:44.540]   So I wouldn't if you do get longer battery life working without LTE, I haven't seen that.
[01:24:44.540 --> 01:24:45.540]   Interesting.
[01:24:45.540 --> 01:24:46.700]   Okay.
[01:24:46.700 --> 01:24:48.300]   They did really beef up the battery.
[01:24:48.300 --> 01:24:53.020]   It's not much heavier or thicker, but the battery significantly got at I'm just holding
[01:24:53.020 --> 01:24:54.660]   this in front of me.
[01:24:54.660 --> 01:24:57.540]   Forget the Kevlar, this battery is going to stop pretty much anything.
[01:24:57.540 --> 01:24:58.540]   Yeah.
[01:24:58.540 --> 01:25:02.140]   Let's talk about overheating because that's the one thing I'm getting a lot of people
[01:25:02.140 --> 01:25:06.540]   asking me on Twitter and elsewhere, well, how hot is your iPad 3?
[01:25:06.540 --> 01:25:07.540]   Is it overheating?
[01:25:07.540 --> 01:25:09.980]   Are you having problems?
[01:25:09.980 --> 01:25:11.420]   You reported this in your review.
[01:25:11.420 --> 01:25:15.540]   I've seen other reviews say 5 to 10 degrees hotter, right?
[01:25:15.540 --> 01:25:16.540]   What is it?
[01:25:16.540 --> 01:25:17.540]   It's a corner where the A5 chip is.
[01:25:17.540 --> 01:25:18.540]   Is that it?
[01:25:18.540 --> 01:25:19.540]   A5X chip is right?
[01:25:19.540 --> 01:25:20.540]   Right.
[01:25:20.540 --> 01:25:27.500]   You're holding it like this, you'll feel a little bit of extra heat right here.
[01:25:27.500 --> 01:25:31.060]   I certainly wouldn't characterize it as overheating.
[01:25:31.060 --> 01:25:34.580]   Only that I've used the iPad one.
[01:25:34.580 --> 01:25:39.060]   I used to after using it for a couple of hours, part of the back of this being any warmer
[01:25:39.060 --> 01:25:43.340]   than any other part of it, apart from the heat from my hands.
[01:25:43.340 --> 01:25:47.500]   So this is the first iPad I've ever used where I can notice that gosh, it feels in this
[01:25:47.500 --> 01:25:48.500]   hand right here.
[01:25:48.500 --> 01:25:51.140]   Even when I have it in an easel, it feels a little bit warmer.
[01:25:51.140 --> 01:25:52.500]   But really, that's all it is.
[01:25:52.500 --> 01:25:58.420]   It feels a little bit warmer.
[01:25:58.420 --> 01:26:02.620]   If you're just tuning in Andy Inato, he's at the hands-on demonstration of the iPhone
[01:26:02.620 --> 01:26:03.620]   5.
[01:26:03.620 --> 01:26:04.620]   It has one of his hands right now.
[01:26:04.620 --> 01:26:05.620]   Yeah.
[01:26:05.620 --> 01:26:10.340]   It looks, it is much, much thinner in hand than it looks in the demo, in any video or
[01:26:10.340 --> 01:26:11.700]   photo you might get.
[01:26:11.700 --> 01:26:16.660]   It feels noticeably lighter than my iPhone 4S.
[01:26:16.660 --> 01:26:20.380]   And I've had that thing in my hand for the past two hours tweeting.
[01:26:20.380 --> 01:26:24.020]   So I know how heavy the iPhone 4S sometimes feels.
[01:26:24.020 --> 01:26:26.300]   Very, very slick piece of kit.
[01:26:26.300 --> 01:26:30.620]   Right now I'm focusing on the Sears Tower in Chicago, trying to find the address of the
[01:26:30.620 --> 01:26:34.900]   Chicago Sun-Times so we can get that for future coverage.
[01:26:34.900 --> 01:26:38.780]   But yeah, it's really just a remarkable piece.
[01:26:38.780 --> 01:26:44.260]   And also my ears are still in joy mode after having heard three numbers from the Foo Fighters.
[01:26:44.260 --> 01:26:48.820]   One of my favorite fans in the world probably made quite the fool out of myself with the
[01:26:48.820 --> 01:26:50.020]   cheering at the very, very end.
[01:26:50.020 --> 01:26:54.300]   But then again, after Tim is not on the stage, you're no longer a journalist.
[01:26:54.300 --> 01:26:57.260]   You can actually be a proper fanboy.
[01:26:57.260 --> 01:27:00.220]   All that pent up cheering just poured out of you.
[01:27:00.220 --> 01:27:01.220]   Yes.
[01:27:01.220 --> 01:27:05.500]   But yeah, I mean, it was, I actually was tweeting out how, okay, we've seen nothing that we
[01:27:05.500 --> 01:27:06.500]   didn't plan to see before.
[01:27:06.500 --> 01:27:09.620]   And then of course they dropped all the other stuff about iOS.
[01:27:09.620 --> 01:27:14.420]   So this idea of not wanting to crowd out the iPhone with other announcements turned out
[01:27:14.420 --> 01:27:19.580]   not to be the smart money because they decided to, of course, update every single thing that
[01:27:19.580 --> 01:27:23.340]   they had going in the iPod line.
[01:27:23.340 --> 01:27:26.220]   So it makes you think about what might be happening next month and those rumors also come to
[01:27:26.220 --> 01:27:28.020]   pass.
[01:27:28.020 --> 01:27:34.780]   Also, and also upon exit, everybody got a new set of earbuds and a card for the iTunes
[01:27:34.780 --> 01:27:35.780]   store.
[01:27:35.780 --> 01:27:36.780]   Wow.
[01:27:36.780 --> 01:27:38.940]   Have you tried the earbuds yet?
[01:27:38.940 --> 01:27:42.020]   I have not tried the earbuds yet because I was scrambling to be one of the first people
[01:27:42.020 --> 01:27:43.420]   to get my mitzvah in one.
[01:27:43.420 --> 01:27:47.180]   I've already decided, I've already had about five minutes with it and then voluntarily gave
[01:27:47.180 --> 01:27:51.900]   it up to someone next to me because I don't want to be a total iPhone hub.
[01:27:51.900 --> 01:27:54.180]   But have not taken out of the box yet.
[01:27:54.180 --> 01:27:59.780]   It's interesting thing is that the demo of it on stage basically made it sound as though
[01:27:59.780 --> 01:28:04.700]   the earbuds can be the most complicated things that an engineer can work on.
[01:28:04.700 --> 01:28:10.140]   It's a three-port design that is designed to channel sound through the stem of the earbuds
[01:28:10.140 --> 01:28:13.300]   through three individually tuned ports.
[01:28:13.300 --> 01:28:17.420]   So clearly the next thing I'm going to have to try out is exactly how well we'll just
[01:28:17.420 --> 01:28:19.580]   put some flu fighters up and see how that plays out.
[01:28:19.580 --> 01:28:22.020]   Well, it's interesting because they're only $29.
[01:28:22.020 --> 01:28:27.420]   So if they are in fact, you know, that's significantly improved, that's going to be
[01:28:27.420 --> 01:28:29.260]   an amazing deal.
[01:28:29.260 --> 01:28:30.260]   Absolutely.
[01:28:30.260 --> 01:28:36.060]   And it's certainly in the price range of most premium, to see that Apple has been paying
[01:28:36.060 --> 01:28:38.940]   attention to pretty much every element of it.
[01:28:38.940 --> 01:28:45.380]   I think one of the money quotes from Tim Cook was really the Apple mission statement, which
[01:28:45.380 --> 01:28:50.620]   is that great products actually enhance people's lives on a day-to-day basis and that's probably
[01:28:50.620 --> 01:28:53.020]   why they like to do the things that they do.
[01:28:53.020 --> 01:28:56.580]   And so it's, at any time you're trying to figure out what they're going to be working
[01:28:56.580 --> 01:29:02.420]   on, the iPhone 5, apart from the larger screen, doesn't feel like an absolutely revolutionary
[01:29:02.420 --> 01:29:03.420]   upgrade.
[01:29:03.420 --> 01:29:07.540]   But you notice that they focus on making the screen better and pleasant where to read.
[01:29:07.540 --> 01:29:09.940]   It is the contrast scene sharper.
[01:29:09.940 --> 01:29:11.460]   Details seem to pop a little bit.
[01:29:11.460 --> 01:29:16.700]   I had it side by side next to my iPhone 4S for a bit and yeah, it's noticeably better.
[01:29:16.700 --> 01:29:18.940]   This new laminated screen is just wonderfully aces.
[01:29:18.940 --> 01:29:21.660]   And then the other thing which is, well, if we're going to give away free headphones
[01:29:21.660 --> 01:29:25.460]   with these things, we may as well make them great headphones rather than just sending them
[01:29:25.460 --> 01:29:27.860]   out to the lowest bidder somewhere.
[01:29:27.860 --> 01:29:34.300]   But, again, you understand, I've said in the past about how it's not always relevant
[01:29:34.300 --> 01:29:40.140]   for, it's not always important for Apple to make things thinner like the Retina MacBook.
[01:29:40.140 --> 01:29:44.180]   But you can see why they want to make a phone thinner because, again, it just kind of just
[01:29:44.180 --> 01:29:45.860]   appears in the hand.
[01:29:45.860 --> 01:29:46.860]   And that's good.
[01:29:46.860 --> 01:29:50.300]   I'm going to put about passes on somebody else who can get another chance at it, but
[01:29:50.300 --> 01:29:52.660]   really, really remarkable experience holding on with it.
[01:29:52.660 --> 01:29:56.860]   Is the LTE turned on? Are you able to try the LTE or is that something that?
[01:29:56.860 --> 01:30:00.380]   I haven't tried the LTE. Everything is on Wi-Fi.
[01:30:00.380 --> 01:30:04.700]   It's probably a very, very cluttered environment.
[01:30:04.700 --> 01:30:08.620]   The first time that I tried to, of course, get myself indulgent screenshots of the phone
[01:30:08.620 --> 01:30:12.500]   with the sometimes site on it and my personal site on it, it took a little while for the
[01:30:12.500 --> 01:30:15.860]   first burst of people trying to get their own personal websites up on the phone.
[01:30:15.860 --> 01:30:18.020]   Their own personal newspapers up on the phone took a while.
[01:30:18.020 --> 01:30:20.420]   But after that, it was very, very, very zippy.
[01:30:20.420 --> 01:30:26.980]   I also want to talk about how really wonderful the, again, the 3D Maps feature is.
[01:30:26.980 --> 01:30:30.780]   But I think we've used some of these features in the past where you think, well, that's
[01:30:30.780 --> 01:30:35.260]   kind of cute if you've got that much time to just, again, see if you can see through
[01:30:35.260 --> 01:30:38.540]   the windows of your apartment building on that, and then you never use it again.
[01:30:38.540 --> 01:30:43.780]   This is so liquid and so fluid that I could really see myself using it as a way to thank
[01:30:43.780 --> 01:30:47.180]   God, damn it, I know that Nanking Palace is supposed to be somewhere on the street.
[01:30:47.180 --> 01:30:51.740]   Where the hell is it? And then actually doing about a mile worth of legwork on the phone
[01:30:51.740 --> 01:30:54.300]   rather than having to do it on actual foot.
[01:30:54.300 --> 01:30:59.580]   I mean, it is completely interactive, completely fluid, works brilliantly.
[01:30:59.580 --> 01:31:04.340]   The only, there are some new kind of gestures to learn to get to street level if you want
[01:31:04.340 --> 01:31:08.060]   a more lower camera angle on what you're looking at.
[01:31:08.060 --> 01:31:10.340]   But you get the hang of it pretty darn quickly.
[01:31:10.340 --> 01:31:14.340]   Also coverage is not absolutely in depth at this point.
[01:31:14.340 --> 01:31:19.660]   I wanted to, for instance, the demo phones are set up with bookmarks for popular landmarks.
[01:31:19.660 --> 01:31:24.220]   I was in Chicago and of course I was able to get to the Sears Tower, but I could not
[01:31:24.220 --> 01:31:28.020]   find the Sun Times building, which probably had to navigate directly.
[01:31:28.020 --> 01:31:33.300]   So if you want that really cool, I'm riding a 20th floor helicopter around the building.
[01:31:33.300 --> 01:31:36.940]   Those are going to be for specific landmarks that have definitely already been cataloged
[01:31:36.940 --> 01:31:41.660]   for other things like the famous giant chrome dean in Millennium Park.
[01:31:41.660 --> 01:31:44.340]   You can definitely see it, you can definitely helicopter around it, but you're not going
[01:31:44.340 --> 01:31:49.340]   to be able to land the helicopter and get a ground floor, peep at it.
[01:31:49.340 --> 01:31:53.140]   So clearly even as a first day demo, it was a great demo.
[01:31:53.140 --> 01:31:59.740]   I look forward to seeing how good this is going to be in about a year after how it is
[01:31:59.740 --> 01:32:03.420]   going to be in about a year when they've got more of this populated.
[01:32:03.420 --> 01:32:06.140]   Did you get a chance to play with the camera at all?
[01:32:06.140 --> 01:32:08.700]   Can you tell if it's improved?
[01:32:08.700 --> 01:32:13.580]   I have not been able to, I am, oh my god, I'm within 10 feet of Foo Fighters.
[01:32:13.580 --> 01:32:14.940]   I have a 10 feet of Foo Fighters.
[01:32:14.940 --> 01:32:18.620]   I'll let you go kiss Dave Grohl if you want, it's okay.
[01:32:18.620 --> 01:32:20.860]   10 feet of, yeah, exactly.
[01:32:20.860 --> 01:32:25.380]   I'm basically making sure that I'm not going to get in people's way.
[01:32:25.380 --> 01:32:29.380]   There is a, sorry, excuse me.
[01:32:29.380 --> 01:32:30.380]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:32:30.380 --> 01:32:32.380]   You use your iPhone, man.
[01:32:32.380 --> 01:32:45.020]   I think Andy Inaka, who is at the hands-on right now at the Apple event, is having more fun
[01:32:45.020 --> 01:32:46.020]   than we are.
[01:32:46.020 --> 01:32:47.660]   Yeah, he's a Foo Fighters fan.
[01:32:47.660 --> 01:32:49.300]   I decided not to.
[01:32:49.300 --> 01:32:50.300]   My favorite bands.
[01:32:50.300 --> 01:32:53.300]   I once canceled plans, they're playing live on Letterman.
[01:32:53.300 --> 01:32:55.340]   Let alone anything else.
[01:32:55.340 --> 01:32:59.340]   He's actually touching Dave Grohl's hem right now.
[01:32:59.340 --> 01:33:00.340]   Thank you.
[01:33:00.340 --> 01:33:01.340]   Thanks guys.
[01:33:01.340 --> 01:33:02.340]   I love all your stuff.
[01:33:02.340 --> 01:33:04.780]   I just get a rack of Foo Fighters.
[01:33:04.780 --> 01:33:06.780]   Two Foo Fighters.
[01:33:06.780 --> 01:33:07.780]   Hey.
[01:33:07.780 --> 01:33:14.380]   Well, I'm glad it was worth flying Andy out just for that.
[01:33:14.380 --> 01:33:16.220]   Andy, we'll let you go.
[01:33:16.220 --> 01:33:21.300]   I know you're going to want to spend more time with the Foo Fighters and the phone.
[01:33:21.300 --> 01:33:24.620]   No, I'm looking forward to all the things that's probably good that I'm talking to you
[01:33:24.620 --> 01:33:27.820]   because otherwise I'd be sort of saying, well, why don't I just say hello and see you.
[01:33:27.820 --> 01:33:29.860]   I'll see if we can get lunch together.
[01:33:29.860 --> 01:33:33.740]   It's being distracted by something else rather than geeking out.
[01:33:33.740 --> 01:33:35.660]   It's a little bit bigger, by the way.
[01:33:35.660 --> 01:33:36.660]   How you doing?
[01:33:36.660 --> 01:33:38.860]   By the way.
[01:33:38.860 --> 01:33:41.820]   If you're looking to fill out your tech-funded bingo card, you would have filled it up in
[01:33:41.820 --> 01:33:43.820]   about the first six minutes.
[01:33:43.820 --> 01:33:48.260]   I don't think he is.
[01:33:48.260 --> 01:33:49.260]   Andy, have fun.
[01:33:49.260 --> 01:33:54.980]   We'll let you go.
[01:33:54.980 --> 01:33:57.140]   Apple announced all the things today.
[01:33:57.140 --> 01:33:58.140]   Everything.
[01:33:58.140 --> 01:33:59.140]   Everything.
[01:33:59.140 --> 01:34:04.380]   I think most of us are saying, oh, this will be the little add-on announcement to the September
[01:34:04.380 --> 01:34:05.380]   announcements.
[01:34:05.380 --> 01:34:09.700]   This was bigger, much bigger, even though it was in a smaller venue than last month's
[01:34:09.700 --> 01:34:10.700]   announcements.
[01:34:10.700 --> 01:34:11.700]   Huge.
[01:34:11.700 --> 01:34:14.100]   One thing after another, relentless.
[01:34:14.100 --> 01:34:20.820]   So, let me run through kind of in order the things Tim Cook and Phil Schiller talked about.
[01:34:20.820 --> 01:34:24.980]   By the way, no Scott Forstall on stage.
[01:34:24.980 --> 01:34:30.940]   There may be something to read in that if that's the balcony on the Kremlin overlooking
[01:34:30.940 --> 01:34:33.380]   the May Day Parade.
[01:34:33.380 --> 01:34:35.580]   One of the generals was missing.
[01:34:35.580 --> 01:34:37.740]   But before we get to that, let's talk about what Apple did announce.
[01:34:37.740 --> 01:34:43.380]   They started off as we expected with a new version of iBooks 3 adding a landscape mode
[01:34:43.380 --> 01:34:45.580]   and a few other features.
[01:34:45.580 --> 01:34:50.660]   We thought the rumor was this was going to be a big focus on education announcement.
[01:34:50.660 --> 01:34:52.100]   In fact, it was not.
[01:34:52.100 --> 01:34:57.100]   That was, you know, they did update iBooks Author 2.0 is coming out today.
[01:34:57.100 --> 01:34:59.300]   iBooks 3 coming out today.
[01:34:59.300 --> 01:35:02.320]   But really, that was it when it comes to education.
[01:35:02.320 --> 01:35:08.900]   These announcements spoke to the mainstream of Apple's product line in a big way, including
[01:35:08.900 --> 01:35:11.700]   three new Macs.
[01:35:11.700 --> 01:35:15.580]   Now we did expect the MacBook Pro 13-inch Retin display.
[01:35:15.580 --> 01:35:16.900]   We got it.
[01:35:16.900 --> 01:35:21.460]   Very thin, three quarters of an inch, thin, 3.57 pounds light.
[01:35:21.460 --> 01:35:26.740]   It's a 2560 by 1600 4 megapixel Retin display.
[01:35:26.740 --> 01:35:31.900]   Tim Cook said the second highest density display we make.
[01:35:31.900 --> 01:35:34.100]   It's going to come in the industry.
[01:35:34.100 --> 01:35:37.300]   That's right because nobody else is doing this.
[01:35:37.300 --> 01:35:44.220]   It's going to be shipped with a solid-state drive, 8 gigs of RAM, 2.5 gigahertz i5 processor
[01:35:44.220 --> 01:35:47.100]   for $16.99.
[01:35:47.100 --> 01:35:52.340]   So it is much cheaper, about $600 cheaper than the 15-inch MacBook Pro with Retin display,
[01:35:52.340 --> 01:35:55.260]   but still at a premium price for the Retin.
[01:35:55.260 --> 01:35:58.660]   I'll tell you what, let me get through all of these and then we can go one by one along.
[01:35:58.660 --> 01:36:03.220]   There was a new Mac Mini announced, very kind of high-powered Mac Mini with i5 and i7
[01:36:03.220 --> 01:36:08.220]   processors, Intel's Ivy Bridge, Thunderbolt, and Firewire.
[01:36:08.220 --> 01:36:10.780]   They still make Macs with Firewire 800 on them.
[01:36:10.780 --> 01:36:16.180]   I think that's more a tip of the hat to how people use the Mac Mini than anything else.
[01:36:16.180 --> 01:36:18.140]   It's not a discrete graphics GPU.
[01:36:18.140 --> 01:36:20.500]   It's not intended to run big monitors.
[01:36:20.500 --> 01:36:24.700]   It's really intended for server closets and perhaps home theater PCs.
[01:36:24.700 --> 01:36:28.940]   They did announce a new iMac and here's where the surprise happened because I don't think
[01:36:28.940 --> 01:36:33.900]   anybody reported much of a redesign on the iMac and in fact it was redesigned.
[01:36:33.900 --> 01:36:40.020]   Still has a big chin, but boy, it's very thin and profile, 5 millimeters on the edge,
[01:36:40.020 --> 01:36:45.980]   a bit of a bulge in the middle, but the appearance is of a gorgeous, thin display using something
[01:36:45.980 --> 01:36:49.060]   called "I don't know what it is, but I'm sure I'll find out today."
[01:36:49.060 --> 01:36:54.500]   Friction stir welding, 2560x1440.
[01:36:54.500 --> 01:36:57.820]   They say each display is individually calibrated.
[01:36:57.820 --> 01:37:00.780]   That's kind of a little bit of a tip of the hat to the photographers and other pro-users
[01:37:00.780 --> 01:37:04.260]   who want really accurate color on their display.
[01:37:04.260 --> 01:37:10.540]   40% less volume in this new iMac, 8 pounds lighter than the previous iMac.
[01:37:10.540 --> 01:37:14.300]   It will ship with a solid state drive or a hard drive spinning hard drive.
[01:37:14.300 --> 01:37:17.180]   In fact, the base models are spinning hard drives.
[01:37:17.180 --> 01:37:24.620]   There is a BTO option with an Apple's calling its Fusion drive which combines flash with
[01:37:24.620 --> 01:37:27.380]   a 1 or 3 terabyte spinning drive.
[01:37:27.380 --> 01:37:30.380]   The 21 inch version of that iMac won't be available till November.
[01:37:30.380 --> 01:37:39.740]   It will be $12.99, the same price I think as the existing iMac, the $27.16.99 in December.
[01:37:39.740 --> 01:37:43.420]   Then they kind of surprised people.
[01:37:43.420 --> 01:37:48.540]   They replaced the current iPad.
[01:37:48.540 --> 01:37:51.420]   The third generation iPad, it's the old one.
[01:37:51.420 --> 01:37:55.700]   There is now a fourth generation iPad, not a significant change.
[01:37:55.700 --> 01:38:01.380]   Same price, biggest change is faster processor, an A6X processor, which Tim Cook said is twice
[01:38:01.380 --> 01:38:03.540]   as fast.
[01:38:03.540 --> 01:38:07.260]   Remember that the iPhone 5 has the A6 and is significantly faster than the third generation
[01:38:07.260 --> 01:38:08.260]   iPad.
[01:38:08.260 --> 01:38:12.540]   Forget your third generation iPad, it's now the fourth generation iPad.
[01:38:12.540 --> 01:38:13.740]   That was a bit of a surprise as well.
[01:38:13.740 --> 01:38:18.660]   Of course, Lightning Connector, as you would expect from all new Apple mobile devices.
[01:38:18.660 --> 01:38:22.060]   The iPad Mini, that's the name.
[01:38:22.060 --> 01:38:25.660]   It's the Mini, I didn't think it would be called the Mini.
[01:38:25.660 --> 01:38:26.660]   Lower case M.
[01:38:26.660 --> 01:38:28.500]   Lower case M, just like the Mac Mini.
[01:38:28.500 --> 01:38:31.220]   So it fits in that line, I guess.
[01:38:31.220 --> 01:38:35.580]   0.68 pounds, Tim said light is a pad of paper.
[01:38:35.580 --> 01:38:38.660]   It is not a 7.85 inch screen, it's 7.9.
[01:38:38.660 --> 01:38:42.260]   So there, 1024 by 768.
[01:38:42.260 --> 01:38:49.780]   The rumor was that it would be $329 for an 8 gig version, close, 16 gigs, 329, 32 gigs,
[01:38:49.780 --> 01:38:52.100]   4.99, 64 gigs, 499.
[01:38:52.100 --> 01:39:00.460]   You can pre-order Friday, but the Wi-Fi won't ship till November 2, the LTE till November
[01:39:00.460 --> 01:39:02.500]   16.
[01:39:02.500 --> 01:39:07.860]   Apple stock price took a little bit of a hit down to 6.24 as a result of the news, that's
[01:39:07.860 --> 01:39:09.500]   to be expected.
[01:39:09.500 --> 01:39:10.740]   So there's the rundown.
[01:39:10.740 --> 01:39:12.100]   No special musical guest.
[01:39:12.100 --> 01:39:18.420]   It was held in a small, formerly, looked like formerly a movie theater, kind of a Golden Age
[01:39:18.420 --> 01:39:21.580]   movie theater in downtown San Jose.
[01:39:21.580 --> 01:39:24.820]   Small enough that I think Apple decided they better stream this event for the journalists
[01:39:24.820 --> 01:39:27.580]   who weren't able to go or get in.
[01:39:27.580 --> 01:39:29.180]   And so we were able to watch the live stream.
[01:39:29.180 --> 01:39:33.420]   We did make a Twitch special, it's episode, a Twitch special number, 141 if you want to
[01:39:33.420 --> 01:39:40.860]   watch Tom Merritt, Sarah Lane, IAs, Actar, and me comment as Tim Cooks on the stage.
[01:39:40.860 --> 01:39:44.260]   Phil Schiller did most of the demos.
[01:39:44.260 --> 01:39:46.260]   Nobody, no third party vendors.
[01:39:46.260 --> 01:39:52.740]   No electronic arts showing an Infinity Blade, Dungeons 4 or anything like that.
[01:39:52.740 --> 01:39:57.540]   So it was a fairly quick announcement, considering the amount of material they had to go through.
[01:39:57.540 --> 01:40:00.300]   They did also talk a little bit about the great success of the iPad.
[01:40:00.300 --> 01:40:05.060]   They say there are now 100 million iPads in use worldwide over two and a half years of
[01:40:05.060 --> 01:40:07.020]   sales.
[01:40:07.020 --> 01:40:08.020]   How many?
[01:40:08.020 --> 01:40:15.140]   They said 750,000 apps, 35 billion app downloads, lots of big, big numbers.
[01:40:15.140 --> 01:40:18.660]   Let me start with you, Renee Richie, because of course, iMore was the source for most of
[01:40:18.660 --> 01:40:20.780]   the rumors about the Mini.
[01:40:20.780 --> 01:40:23.860]   Were there surprises here for you, even for you?
[01:40:23.860 --> 01:40:28.020]   I think the only big surprise for me is when we initially heard about the iPad Mini back
[01:40:28.020 --> 01:40:35.260]   in May, we heard there'd be an 8 gigabyte model at around $200 to $250 with the express
[01:40:35.260 --> 01:40:41.460]   purposes of taking it to the sort of Nexus 7, Amazon Kindle 7 space.
[01:40:41.460 --> 01:40:43.380]   And it looks like Apple didn't go ahead with that skew.
[01:40:43.380 --> 01:40:45.740]   They went right to the 16 gigabyte model.
[01:40:45.740 --> 01:40:49.540]   That was the only thing that surprised me, but I think the form factor, the screen, everything
[01:40:49.540 --> 01:40:51.660]   like that was pretty much what we heard.
[01:40:51.660 --> 01:40:53.380]   Wasn't everybody saying a 7.85 inches?
[01:40:53.380 --> 01:40:55.340]   I mean, they might be rounding up.
[01:40:55.340 --> 01:40:56.540]   We'll have to measure it.
[01:40:56.540 --> 01:40:57.540]   Okay.
[01:40:57.540 --> 01:40:58.540]   It doesn't matter that much.
[01:40:58.540 --> 01:41:00.540]   Half an inch.
[01:41:00.540 --> 01:41:01.540]   How about the iMac?
[01:41:01.540 --> 01:41:03.500]   Did anybody expect that?
[01:41:03.500 --> 01:41:04.500]   Yes.
[01:41:04.500 --> 01:41:06.340]   I think I'm sorry, Renee.
[01:41:06.340 --> 01:41:08.060]   No, I'm sorry.
[01:41:08.060 --> 01:41:11.740]   I was just going to say that the Chinese message boards are becoming a wealth of information
[01:41:11.740 --> 01:41:14.820]   about upcoming Apple products because they have to make them.
[01:41:14.820 --> 01:41:15.980]   And so, absolutely.
[01:41:15.980 --> 01:41:17.380]   They're seeing them.
[01:41:17.380 --> 01:41:18.380]   Yeah.
[01:41:18.380 --> 01:41:21.140]   And they posted about some of the internals for this device.
[01:41:21.140 --> 01:41:24.780]   And we heard independently that they're going to be using the laminated display from
[01:41:24.780 --> 01:41:25.780]   the Retina MacBook.
[01:41:25.780 --> 01:41:26.780]   Right.
[01:41:26.780 --> 01:41:30.060]   So you put that together with the other stuff and it sounded like a thinner iMac and that's
[01:41:30.060 --> 01:41:35.940]   pretty much what we got.
[01:41:35.940 --> 01:41:37.740]   So there was also a big storm.
[01:41:37.740 --> 01:41:41.220]   There still is going on, Becky, although it's tapering off now.
[01:41:41.220 --> 01:41:43.620]   And a lot of things went down.
[01:41:43.620 --> 01:41:45.940]   You were starting the list, Renee, Gizmodo.
[01:41:45.940 --> 01:41:47.980]   Actually, all of Gawker was down, right?
[01:41:47.980 --> 01:41:50.460]   Off-home was down for a short amount of time.
[01:41:50.460 --> 01:41:51.460]   Squarespace.
[01:41:51.460 --> 01:41:53.020]   You just said before rebooted.
[01:41:53.020 --> 01:41:54.020]   It was interesting.
[01:41:54.020 --> 01:41:55.020]   It's interesting.
[01:41:55.020 --> 01:41:58.580]   They kept their servers on overnight, but then they decided, I guess, for maintenance
[01:41:58.580 --> 01:42:01.220]   reasons, to reboot everything.
[01:42:01.220 --> 01:42:04.580]   And it canceled a Google event that was scheduled for one day.
[01:42:04.580 --> 01:42:05.580]   Yeah.
[01:42:05.580 --> 01:42:09.460]   New York was, I think that pictures of taxi caps kind of floating down the streets.
[01:42:09.460 --> 01:42:13.820]   Also, a lot of pictures of things that didn't happen.
[01:42:13.820 --> 01:42:19.580]   There was no, apparently the shark pictures that Twitter was inundated with.
[01:42:19.580 --> 01:42:22.060]   There were no, I remember that from my rain last year.
[01:42:22.060 --> 01:42:23.060]   Yeah.
[01:42:23.060 --> 01:42:24.060]   Yeah.
[01:42:24.060 --> 01:42:25.060]   People love that stuff.
[01:42:25.060 --> 01:42:31.820]   There's Alex Alexis Madrigal on the Atlantic did a really good job of debunking a lot of
[01:42:31.820 --> 01:42:33.620]   the Twitter pictures.
[01:42:33.620 --> 01:42:37.700]   And then there's also a Twitter feed, or a Tumblr, I should say, feed called Twitter.
[01:42:37.700 --> 01:42:41.660]   I think it's Twitter is wrong.
[01:42:41.660 --> 01:42:43.700]   And this is probably one to keep around.
[01:42:43.700 --> 01:42:47.940]   Is Twitter wrong dot tumblr dot com?
[01:42:47.940 --> 01:42:52.900]   It's a good tumblr to keep around because Twitter apparently posts, there's a lot of
[01:42:52.900 --> 01:43:02.420]   posts on Twitter that really, for instance, lots of pictures of thunderstorm cells, a certain
[01:43:02.420 --> 01:43:06.900]   kind of thunderstorm cell cell thunderstorm or something.
[01:43:06.900 --> 01:43:07.900]   Supercell.
[01:43:07.900 --> 01:43:08.900]   There's no citation needed.
[01:43:08.900 --> 01:43:09.900]   Yeah.
[01:43:09.900 --> 01:43:13.940]   And these pictures are real, but they're not, but they're actually something much less destructive
[01:43:13.940 --> 01:43:14.940]   than Sandy.
[01:43:14.940 --> 01:43:17.140]   The problem with the hurricane is it's kind of just boring.
[01:43:17.140 --> 01:43:19.700]   It's like, it's just kind of clouds and wind.
[01:43:19.700 --> 01:43:23.580]   These are all if you're lucky, if you're lucky, it's boring.
[01:43:23.580 --> 01:43:27.620]   This is, this is posted on Twitter as an amazing photo of Sandy meeting the statue of Liberty,
[01:43:27.620 --> 01:43:28.620]   of course, not.
[01:43:28.620 --> 01:43:31.420]   It's a super, supercell thunderstorm.
[01:43:31.420 --> 01:43:40.060]   That's a nice, nice job taking a picture from the day after tomorrow and adding the NY1
[01:43:40.060 --> 01:43:42.740]   live cam lower third onto it.
[01:43:42.740 --> 01:43:43.740]   So these are, this is good.
[01:43:43.740 --> 01:43:45.220]   But now this is real.
[01:43:45.220 --> 01:43:47.260]   And some of this stuff is devastating.
[01:43:47.260 --> 01:43:49.140]   This is the one of the shark pictures.
[01:43:49.140 --> 01:43:52.460]   And they still Alexis Madrigal has published this at the Atlantic Monthly and they're trying
[01:43:52.460 --> 01:43:53.660]   to track it down.
[01:43:53.660 --> 01:43:57.780]   I suppose there's no reason why you couldn't have fish, but I think sharks and other fish
[01:43:57.780 --> 01:43:59.940]   would probably try to stay out of that.
[01:43:59.940 --> 01:44:00.940]   That one's obviously fake.
[01:44:00.940 --> 01:44:03.140]   That first one looked really good.
[01:44:03.140 --> 01:44:05.660]   The first one is a good fake if it's a fake.
[01:44:05.660 --> 01:44:06.660]   It could be done.
[01:44:06.660 --> 01:44:07.660]   You could fake it.
[01:44:07.660 --> 01:44:08.660]   Sure.
[01:44:08.660 --> 01:44:09.660]   Sure.
[01:44:09.660 --> 01:44:13.500]   And that one, this is actually the first thing you find if you search for shark fin in Google
[01:44:13.500 --> 01:44:16.860]   image search and then there was a Mac pro cited in a storm.
[01:44:16.860 --> 01:44:17.860]   That would be unbelievable.
[01:44:17.860 --> 01:44:19.500]   Yeah, I'd love that.
[01:44:19.500 --> 01:44:20.500]   There's another shark.
[01:44:20.500 --> 01:44:22.060]   I can say it's well done.
[01:44:22.060 --> 01:44:23.060]   Yes.
[01:44:23.060 --> 01:44:24.220]   Swimming along on the West Side Highway there.
[01:44:24.220 --> 01:44:25.900]   I commend you for the creativity.
[01:44:25.900 --> 01:44:30.060]   Oh, we've now apparently, sir, this has been a fake.
[01:44:30.060 --> 01:44:31.060]   This is a fake.
[01:44:31.060 --> 01:44:32.700]   I think you can see the transition.
[01:44:32.700 --> 01:44:36.380]   So right past the house, you can see how the color transitions and the size of the, the
[01:44:36.380 --> 01:44:39.180]   size of the, uh, uh, of the ripples.
[01:44:39.180 --> 01:44:41.500]   I think that that was probably where they made the transition.
[01:44:41.500 --> 01:44:47.100]   You could make a good living, uh, Alex Lindsay as a, uh, Photoshop fake detector.
[01:44:47.100 --> 01:44:51.580]   I mean, really, that'd be like Mythbusters except for photos.
[01:44:51.580 --> 01:44:52.580]   We should.
[01:44:52.580 --> 01:44:53.580]   Okay.
[01:44:53.580 --> 01:44:54.580]   Now we're going to do two new segments.
[01:44:54.580 --> 01:44:59.980]   We're going to do fact checking on commercials and, and then Photoshop, uh, fakes.
[01:44:59.980 --> 01:45:02.980]   I think we could, this could be a, this is, okay, this is a good one.
[01:45:02.980 --> 01:45:03.980]   This is a good fake.
[01:45:03.980 --> 01:45:06.620]   Sharks in the mall.
[01:45:06.620 --> 01:45:10.060]   Oh no, that's Toronto's Union station.
[01:45:10.060 --> 01:45:11.740]   Uh, okay.
[01:45:11.740 --> 01:45:12.740]   These are all fakes.
[01:45:12.740 --> 01:45:15.980]   Those famous Toronto sharks.
[01:45:15.980 --> 01:45:18.700]   This one's real and that's a little scary.
[01:45:18.700 --> 01:45:24.500]   It's one of the, uh, uh, water flooding the path station in New Jersey that's real.
[01:45:24.500 --> 01:45:26.300]   Um, some pretty dramatic stuff.
[01:45:26.300 --> 01:45:28.940]   Anyway, uh, you can't believe everything you read.
[01:45:28.940 --> 01:45:33.580]   However, Andy, you're, you're on the spot and obviously it was nothing.
[01:45:33.580 --> 01:45:36.060]   Had you experienced a sneeze at you'd not experienced anything like that.
[01:45:36.060 --> 01:45:38.060]   I'm sure Irene is.
[01:45:38.060 --> 01:45:40.060]   Uh, it really depends on where you are.
[01:45:40.060 --> 01:45:42.940]   Uh, you know, I've, I've been through a couple of New England storms that were a lot
[01:45:42.940 --> 01:45:43.940]   worse than this.
[01:45:43.940 --> 01:45:45.780]   Uh, most of them were snow events.
[01:45:45.780 --> 01:45:47.700]   It really depends on course where you are.
[01:45:47.700 --> 01:45:48.700]   Yeah.
[01:45:48.700 --> 01:45:52.580]   There's a, I've just heard this morning at breakfast, went to breakfast out.
[01:45:52.580 --> 01:45:56.660]   I've just decided to drive a, drive a while away to be with friends and have some hot
[01:45:56.660 --> 01:45:57.660]   food.
[01:45:57.660 --> 01:46:04.380]   Um, a restaurant that proudly had this little like rebuilt after a 1994 storm that had proudly
[01:46:04.380 --> 01:46:06.740]   had mounted like about chest high around the restaurant.
[01:46:06.740 --> 01:46:10.820]   This is where the flood waters were when we were destroyed in 1994 and that restaurant
[01:46:10.820 --> 01:46:13.460]   got destroyed in this storm too.
[01:46:13.460 --> 01:46:17.660]   So, uh, that's why I always, one of the, one of the other photos that took place,
[01:46:17.660 --> 01:46:22.340]   which tends to get forwarded around as a meme is when a picture, oh my God, the, look
[01:46:22.340 --> 01:46:23.580]   at all the hurricane disaster.
[01:46:23.580 --> 01:46:27.580]   And there's a picture of one patio chair that's on its back on the, on the porch.
[01:46:27.580 --> 01:46:32.060]   Then yeah, yeah, not, not everybody got off quite so lucky.
[01:46:32.060 --> 01:46:35.260]   There are some people who are now completely wiped out with their businesses and homes,
[01:46:35.260 --> 01:46:37.580]   but hey, funny, funny photo.
[01:46:37.580 --> 01:46:38.580]   Yeah.
[01:46:38.580 --> 01:46:39.580]   Yeah.
[01:46:39.580 --> 01:46:41.220]   I don't want to make light of it in any event.
[01:46:41.220 --> 01:46:45.540]   Certainly I have family members there and, uh, yeah, we, we wish everybody well.
[01:46:45.540 --> 01:46:47.620]   Um, and what's interesting is how many people are there?
[01:46:47.620 --> 01:46:48.860]   That's how much it did affect the internet.
[01:46:48.860 --> 01:46:53.980]   How much stuff comes out of New York City and how the power being out are our good friend
[01:46:53.980 --> 01:46:55.140]   Dick T. Bartolo.
[01:46:55.140 --> 01:46:59.540]   Of course, uh, lives on the, uh, uh, the upper west side in New York City.
[01:46:59.540 --> 01:47:03.740]   His boat is just a few blocks away at the, um, boat basin there.
[01:47:03.740 --> 01:47:06.100]   Uh, he says the worst storm I've ever seen in New York City.
[01:47:06.100 --> 01:47:08.380]   The highest tides ever.
[01:47:08.380 --> 01:47:17.100]   And if in some of us were watching, uh, his, uh, his drop cam, um, of the, uh, of the boat
[01:47:17.100 --> 01:47:20.580]   and eventually went dead because power went out there, but he says his, his workboat
[01:47:20.580 --> 01:47:21.580]   did make it through the storm.
[01:47:21.580 --> 01:47:23.860]   Of course, Dick himself survived.
[01:47:23.860 --> 01:47:30.220]   And there's a great bunch of posts, uh, at gizwiz.biz on his blog that you might want
[01:47:30.220 --> 01:47:31.220]   to take a look at.
[01:47:31.220 --> 01:47:35.340]   Um, it's amazing how many people stayed on the internet even without power and even with
[01:47:35.340 --> 01:47:39.260]   the rain coming in and there was a tweet from the New York, I think it was a New York fire
[01:47:39.260 --> 01:47:42.060]   department saying, please don't tweet us disaster reports.
[01:47:42.060 --> 01:47:43.060]   Please call 911.
[01:47:43.060 --> 01:47:49.580]   In fact, I even saw an article how to continue to use Twitter when the power goes out.
[01:47:49.580 --> 01:47:52.700]   It's like this has become our, our bread and butter, right?
[01:47:52.700 --> 01:47:57.780]   But also it does change the technology has changed the way that we respond to these disasters.
[01:47:57.780 --> 01:48:01.740]   I remember the, the blizzard is 78, which for anybody above the age of 35 who grew up
[01:48:01.740 --> 01:48:06.420]   in England is one of the large, is one of the, the, the hallmark memories of childhood,
[01:48:06.420 --> 01:48:11.020]   where the main like four lane highway, two lane, four lane highway, uh, that connects
[01:48:11.020 --> 01:48:14.140]   all of Eastern Massachusetts was covered in snow for two days.
[01:48:14.140 --> 01:48:18.700]   Uh, my, my dad actually brought in a state trooper whose car broke down and we had him
[01:48:18.700 --> 01:48:19.700]   over for lunch.
[01:48:19.700 --> 01:48:21.260]   Uh, one of the days we're snowed in.
[01:48:21.260 --> 01:48:25.420]   It was a, just a huge sense of community and everybody, everybody on their sleds on route
[01:48:25.420 --> 01:48:29.020]   one, uh, you know, trying to get from town to town to check on relatives.
[01:48:29.020 --> 01:48:34.940]   Now, uh, like I said, uh, I've got, uh, surrounding, surrounding me right now, I've got about
[01:48:34.940 --> 01:48:39.420]   23, 24 hours worth of battery backed access to the internet.
[01:48:39.420 --> 01:48:41.300]   And so I can still email people.
[01:48:41.300 --> 01:48:42.300]   I can still tweet people.
[01:48:42.300 --> 01:48:44.580]   I can still text to find out if people are okay.
[01:48:44.580 --> 01:48:48.940]   If I needed to, I could even have done this show, uh, from my house without any power.
[01:48:48.940 --> 01:48:51.300]   And I've got the HD camera on the iPad.
[01:48:51.300 --> 01:48:53.020]   I've got LTE that would work just fine.
[01:48:53.020 --> 01:48:57.540]   Uh, and so maybe, unfortunately, maybe it's, that's turned us from people who re, who
[01:48:57.540 --> 01:49:02.460]   react to these natural disasters by tightening our bonds to our community, who people who
[01:49:02.460 --> 01:49:05.420]   tend to do that by hunkering down a little bit tighter inside our houses.
[01:49:05.420 --> 01:49:06.820]   Yeah, I agree.
[01:49:06.820 --> 01:49:11.300]   Uh, we're going to take a break because I know the big story, the lead and I'm burying the
[01:49:11.300 --> 01:49:16.380]   lead, we mentioned it at the top is Scott forced all out at, uh, Apple and, and in the
[01:49:16.380 --> 01:49:20.500]   process of this, a lot of reporting being done by Nick built in at the New York times,
[01:49:20.500 --> 01:49:28.820]   uh, Oh, Malick at, uh, giga, Ohm, uh, John Gruber, uh, fortune about what it's like inside
[01:49:28.820 --> 01:49:31.460]   Apple right now and some interesting revelation.
[01:49:31.460 --> 01:49:33.500]   So we'll talk about that in just a little bit.
[01:49:33.500 --> 01:49:40.580]   Marco Armin has a, as a circle article about his experience, uh, at a Microsoft, uh, store
[01:49:40.580 --> 01:49:42.980]   looking at the windows, our tea launch.
[01:49:42.980 --> 01:49:46.300]   Um, and, and he really does make it painful.
[01:49:46.300 --> 01:49:47.300]   He does make the point.
[01:49:47.300 --> 01:49:48.580]   He says the store is creepy.
[01:49:48.580 --> 01:49:52.940]   So many elements are embarrassingly sim, similar to the Apple store on the next floor.
[01:49:52.940 --> 01:49:55.300]   Microsoft even ripped off trivial elements.
[01:49:55.300 --> 01:50:00.540]   So he easily have been different things like the blue T shirts and employees where there's
[01:50:00.540 --> 01:50:04.060]   a huge elephant in the room, we can all see it, but Microsoft still implicitly denies it.
[01:50:04.060 --> 01:50:05.300]   Look at the wood floors.
[01:50:05.300 --> 01:50:08.500]   That, I mean, they have, instead of a genius bar, they have, why can't remember what they
[01:50:08.500 --> 01:50:09.940]   call it, but it's a genius bar.
[01:50:09.940 --> 01:50:12.780]   It's kind of like, they couldn't think of anything better wizard bar or something.
[01:50:12.780 --> 01:50:15.460]   Uh, it's a, it's a fun article to read.
[01:50:15.460 --> 01:50:19.140]   It's a little, uh, overly anti negative.
[01:50:19.140 --> 01:50:23.340]   Uh, yeah, it was, it was heavy handed, but you, you, you, you are left with this.
[01:50:23.340 --> 01:50:26.460]   Why, why can't you do something different?
[01:50:26.460 --> 01:50:27.460]   Yeah.
[01:50:27.460 --> 01:50:28.900]   Well, they can't do anything better at this point.
[01:50:28.900 --> 01:50:31.660]   I think they'd rather be hit for being a copy than being a failure.
[01:50:31.660 --> 01:50:35.940]   So they're doing, they're doing the market leader exactly at this point.
[01:50:35.940 --> 01:50:37.140]   I disagree with that.
[01:50:37.140 --> 01:50:39.700]   I think they do some several things as well as Apple does them.
[01:50:39.700 --> 01:50:45.820]   Uh, and I think it's, it's just as, just as, uh, Apple doesn't do themselves any favors
[01:50:45.820 --> 01:50:48.860]   when they over promise and over praise their own products.
[01:50:48.860 --> 01:50:54.060]   Microsoft doesn't do them any favors when a they copy the Apple store so, so, so closely.
[01:50:54.060 --> 01:50:58.980]   And secondly, when they, they, they leave off like that final little, that, that, that,
[01:50:58.980 --> 01:51:03.420]   just like a good contractor, the final walk through of the house before he turns over
[01:51:03.420 --> 01:51:07.820]   the keys, just looking for little nail heads that are sticking up, looking for spots of
[01:51:07.820 --> 01:51:09.460]   paint that got missed.
[01:51:09.460 --> 01:51:13.020]   It's that extra 1% that often turns around an experience.
[01:51:13.020 --> 01:51:17.460]   Microsoft can take a product at 99%, but they're really aren't good at making that final,
[01:51:17.460 --> 01:51:18.660]   but that final step.
[01:51:18.660 --> 01:51:19.660]   Yeah.
[01:51:19.660 --> 01:51:21.300]   And yeah, Mark, Mark, it was, it's fun article.
[01:51:21.300 --> 01:51:23.620]   It's, shall we say it's slightly partisan.
[01:51:23.620 --> 01:51:26.340]   Well, this is the new trend, by the way.
[01:51:26.340 --> 01:51:31.060]   And I, we often get slammed for not being partisan enough that, uh, you know, you notice
[01:51:31.060 --> 01:51:35.900]   your, your reluctance, Andy, to even talk about surface on a Mac break weekly.
[01:51:35.900 --> 01:51:40.820]   Uh, but, but, and so only because it's so, so you, a, I know my own failings that when
[01:51:40.820 --> 01:51:44.460]   I'm enthusiastic about something, I tend to blabble about it long, long, long, long
[01:51:44.460 --> 01:51:45.460]   advice.
[01:51:45.460 --> 01:51:50.500]   And also I'm, I'm in, I'm deep in writing my next thousand words about it mode.
[01:51:50.500 --> 01:51:54.860]   So essentially all 3000 words and 43 minutes of talking about it would come out into this
[01:51:54.860 --> 01:51:55.860]   microphone.
[01:51:55.860 --> 01:51:58.660]   I think, I think it's, I think it's a very, very solid product.
[01:51:58.660 --> 01:52:01.820]   I don't think that it deserves most of the slams that it's getting.
[01:52:01.820 --> 01:52:07.780]   I, I essentially think that, uh, the, the, the, the, the pull quote from the, the part
[01:52:07.780 --> 01:52:12.980]   one was really that with between Apple, uh, between the iPad and surface RT, it really
[01:52:12.980 --> 01:52:14.340]   is a yin and yang sort of thing.
[01:52:14.340 --> 01:52:18.580]   I don't think that one is conceptually better than the other because there are things that
[01:52:18.580 --> 01:52:22.940]   the iPad is just not really very good at that the surface is exceptional at.
[01:52:22.940 --> 01:52:25.600]   And then there are things like, again, anything that involves sitting in comfortably in a
[01:52:25.600 --> 01:52:30.500]   sofa and holding the device, uh, in that sort of a familiar puppy dog sort of way.
[01:52:30.500 --> 01:52:32.460]   The surface, surface RT is like a cat.
[01:52:32.460 --> 01:52:33.700]   It does not want to be held.
[01:52:33.700 --> 01:52:36.740]   It, it, it, it'll bite back.
[01:52:36.740 --> 01:52:37.740]   Yeah.
[01:52:37.740 --> 01:52:44.540]   It's, it's pretty clear that, uh, each company, uh, I don't even include Amazon in this has
[01:52:44.540 --> 01:52:46.540]   something to add to the conversation.
[01:52:46.540 --> 01:52:50.660]   I, I, I, I conversation might have been started by Apple and Apple gets credit for that.
[01:52:50.660 --> 01:52:53.380]   Although, uh, Microsoft's been pushing tablets since 2000.
[01:52:53.380 --> 01:52:58.060]   It's just, they couldn't make a good one, uh, until Apple said, no, no, try this.
[01:52:58.060 --> 01:53:04.020]   And they said, oh, uh, but, uh, but everybody's adding something to conversation.
[01:53:04.020 --> 01:53:06.540]   And if we're for customers, that is really good.
[01:53:06.540 --> 01:53:11.220]   I'm, I'm almost, I'm, I'm really practically giddy about all the choice about this.
[01:53:11.220 --> 01:53:12.220]   Exactly.
[01:53:12.220 --> 01:53:17.060]   Um, uh, Android tenants tablets are absolutely boring because there is nothing that it's
[01:53:17.060 --> 01:53:21.980]   trying to do except for be something like the iPad, only not as good as the iPad and just
[01:53:21.980 --> 01:53:23.740]   as expensive as the iPad.
[01:53:23.740 --> 01:53:28.100]   It's wonderful when you see Amazon come out and say, well, what if we developed a tablet
[01:53:28.100 --> 01:53:31.340]   that was more designed towards reading and content consumption, but we're willing to
[01:53:31.340 --> 01:53:33.980]   make it that not as good at everything else.
[01:53:33.980 --> 01:53:37.300]   If we make it just the best thing possible for content consumption.
[01:53:37.300 --> 01:53:38.660]   And so you have that option.
[01:53:38.660 --> 01:53:43.260]   And then they have surface RT, which is, well, what if you have people who like a tablet,
[01:53:43.260 --> 01:53:47.500]   but they still really, really want something that's more notebooky that really is better
[01:53:47.500 --> 01:53:52.460]   at being handled with a keyboard and a mouse than the iPad is now people have that option.
[01:53:52.460 --> 01:53:55.860]   I, it's, that's why it's sort of disappoints and frustrates me when people try to make
[01:53:55.860 --> 01:54:00.580]   this out into a field of winners and losers that I think is not as good as the iPad and
[01:54:00.580 --> 01:54:01.820]   therefore it's a failure fail.
[01:54:01.820 --> 01:54:03.540]   Well, I think it's a basic.
[01:54:03.540 --> 01:54:04.420]   I think we're moving right.
[01:54:04.420 --> 01:54:05.420]   We have all the.
[01:54:05.420 --> 01:54:06.420]   Go ahead.
[01:54:06.420 --> 01:54:07.420]   All right.
[01:54:07.420 --> 01:54:11.380]   So if you're in the eyes of gray now, you can go from an iPod touch to an iPad mini to an
[01:54:11.380 --> 01:54:14.820]   iPad to a surface to a MacBook Air or ultra book.
[01:54:14.820 --> 01:54:19.620]   And you really can pick exactly as much device as you need for the situation that you're in.
[01:54:19.620 --> 01:54:23.180]   The question is, of course, is when we get into a decision paralysis, you know, I mean,
[01:54:23.180 --> 01:54:26.420]   at some point, within the companies and also with all the other pieces of trying to figure
[01:54:26.420 --> 01:54:28.500]   out, you know, which one you need.
[01:54:28.500 --> 01:54:32.100]   I know that for me, the hard part is you walk into a phone store and you, you know, if
[01:54:32.100 --> 01:54:35.820]   you weren't buying an iPhone from a Verizon store, there are so many phones.
[01:54:35.820 --> 01:54:36.820]   Okay.
[01:54:36.820 --> 01:54:38.380]   I think I can make that choice.
[01:54:38.380 --> 01:54:41.980]   I mean, I get like the, I have a, you know, a galaxy and I have an iPhone and then, you
[01:54:41.980 --> 01:54:45.580]   know, an Exis and, but I don't have a, but I'm not, you know, I'm not all the other ones.
[01:54:45.580 --> 01:54:47.580]   I don't, there are classic consumers.
[01:54:47.580 --> 01:54:50.380]   It just wants to be told that's the one get that right.
[01:54:50.380 --> 01:54:52.340]   But that's not anybody who watches any of our shows.
[01:54:52.340 --> 01:54:56.140]   I mean, I don't think exactly what Tim Cook said about the surface when he was on Apple's
[01:54:56.140 --> 01:55:00.900]   conference call last Thursday that he, that they didn't make any tough choices that releasing
[01:55:00.900 --> 01:55:06.860]   products is about tough choices and he found the surface message confusing and that Microsoft
[01:55:06.860 --> 01:55:08.700]   didn't decide we're going to make an RT version.
[01:55:08.700 --> 01:55:11.100]   They're doing the RT version and the pro version.
[01:55:11.100 --> 01:55:13.260]   They're doing Metro and the desktop.
[01:55:13.260 --> 01:55:18.860]   They're doing the touch keyboard and the clickety-clack keyboard, which I think is, is a, is a good
[01:55:18.860 --> 01:55:21.700]   example of the different cultures that still exist in both companies.
[01:55:21.700 --> 01:55:23.580]   And you could say the same thing for Android.
[01:55:23.580 --> 01:55:28.460]   Choice over is preferred over a monolithic lead the way strategy.
[01:55:28.460 --> 01:55:32.740]   And that's what Apple's famous for and Apple does a good job of that.
[01:55:32.740 --> 01:55:36.820]   And if you like the Apple way, then you're going to be very happy because you'll, you
[01:55:36.820 --> 01:55:41.820]   know, Johnny Ive will lead you to, to the promised land or, or white heaven.
[01:55:41.820 --> 01:55:45.460]   Well, I think we'll end up with a, and I think that no one's, I think we're definitely moving
[01:55:45.460 --> 01:55:49.420]   quickly to where no one's a winner and a loser, but really everyone's got 20 or 30% of the
[01:55:49.420 --> 01:55:50.420]   market.
[01:55:50.420 --> 01:55:51.420]   But there's also some overlap.
[01:55:51.420 --> 01:55:55.380]   For instance, Google just released today a new Google search for iOS that has very, has
[01:55:55.380 --> 01:55:57.780]   Siri like capabilities.
[01:55:57.780 --> 01:56:02.980]   And so Google now, it's an interesting thing that Google, because Google has a, as a foothold
[01:56:02.980 --> 01:56:08.580]   in iOS, rapidly diminishing foot hold in iOS, but it can start doing things like you can
[01:56:08.580 --> 01:56:13.100]   say what's the weather like in San Francisco on the Google search app on iPhone.
[01:56:13.100 --> 01:56:17.460]   And it will give you a Siri like response.
[01:56:17.460 --> 01:56:19.300]   What's the tallest building in San Francisco?
[01:56:19.300 --> 01:56:21.300]   I mean, this is kind of interesting.
[01:56:21.300 --> 01:56:26.380]   And we, some one that we have to do is download it and do the same question with the exact
[01:56:26.380 --> 01:56:29.900]   same words and see what we get with each one, because I think it's going to be very interesting
[01:56:29.900 --> 01:56:30.900]   to see.
[01:56:30.900 --> 01:56:34.740]   Herbs, that little first of the other guys put them both in isolation booths.
[01:56:34.740 --> 01:56:36.740]   Yeah, that's a good idea.
[01:56:36.740 --> 01:56:38.820]   Again, another one I want to do.
[01:56:38.820 --> 01:56:41.500]   I want to someday we got to do this fake check and stuff.
[01:56:41.500 --> 01:56:45.140]   King's with that road forces and has the letter H in their names.
[01:56:45.140 --> 01:56:51.620]   And the hears of their rain.
[01:56:51.620 --> 01:56:53.620]   It'd be very interesting, wouldn't it?
[01:56:53.620 --> 01:56:54.620]   Yes.
[01:56:54.620 --> 01:56:55.620]   Let's take a break.
[01:56:55.620 --> 01:56:56.620]   Come back.
[01:56:56.620 --> 01:57:01.340]   Lots more to talk about Andy and not go is here from the Chicago Sun times at a undisclosed
[01:57:01.340 --> 01:57:06.180]   location looking somewhat like Johnny I've heaven.
[01:57:06.180 --> 01:57:14.820]   We think this is the best podcast.
[01:57:14.820 --> 01:57:18.260]   Well I hope you've enjoyed this trip down memory lane with Mac break weekly.
[01:57:18.260 --> 01:57:20.180]   And what a great bunch of people.
[01:57:20.180 --> 01:57:23.500]   Alex Lindsey, just adore him, Andy and not go.
[01:57:23.500 --> 01:57:27.140]   I mean, don't you wish he was like your neighbor, your friendly neighbor that'd come over every
[01:57:27.140 --> 01:57:29.860]   once in a while and sit on the porch with you and jaw.
[01:57:29.860 --> 01:57:33.300]   I mean, just talk about his life and his insight.
[01:57:33.300 --> 01:57:34.300]   I mean, just so much fun.
[01:57:34.300 --> 01:57:37.620]   That's why actually I like doing Mac break weekly is because I get to sit down with those
[01:57:37.620 --> 01:57:38.620]   guys.
[01:57:38.620 --> 01:57:41.700]   And our newest host, Renee Richie from I'm More, just love him too.
[01:57:41.700 --> 01:57:45.060]   And of course, all the guests that stop by from time to time to make the show better
[01:57:45.060 --> 01:57:52.500]   like Jason Snell and Chris Breen, Mac OS, Ken Ken Ray, so many great people on the show.
[01:57:52.500 --> 01:57:55.100]   We've got a great year planned for you in 2013.
[01:57:55.100 --> 01:57:59.460]   I thank our producers of Mac break weekly for the first seven months.
[01:57:59.460 --> 01:58:00.700]   It was Eileen Rivera.
[01:58:00.700 --> 01:58:01.700]   She's moved on.
[01:58:01.700 --> 01:58:04.300]   She's working at Google now at YouTube in LA.
[01:58:04.300 --> 01:58:09.460]   And to our new edition and a superstar as far as I'm concerned, Chad Johnson, who does
[01:58:09.460 --> 01:58:13.500]   such a great job putting the show together every weekend, he puts together all of the
[01:58:13.500 --> 01:58:14.500]   big shows on Twitter.
[01:58:14.500 --> 01:58:16.340]   He's just a star producer.
[01:58:16.340 --> 01:58:18.700]   You got to watch his show, OMG Craft.
[01:58:18.700 --> 01:58:21.620]   What are you going to do for the holidays for a OMG Craft?
[01:58:21.620 --> 01:58:23.980]   Are you going to build a Yule Log?
[01:58:23.980 --> 01:58:27.340]   Yeah, a Minecraft Yule Log in the fireplace.
[01:58:27.340 --> 01:58:28.340]   That'd be good.
[01:58:28.340 --> 01:58:30.380]   OMG Craft is Tuesdays, right?
[01:58:30.380 --> 01:58:31.380]   Thursdays.
[01:58:31.380 --> 01:58:35.100]   7pm, Pacific 10pm Eastern.
[01:58:35.100 --> 01:58:42.940]   And it's live, but you can also watch it on ChadSightOMGCraft.com on the web.
[01:58:42.940 --> 01:58:45.740]   Well, this has been a fun Christmas day.
[01:58:45.740 --> 01:58:47.380]   Thank you for spending some time with me.
[01:58:47.380 --> 01:58:49.260]   I hope you're enjoying our show.
[01:58:49.260 --> 01:58:51.540]   We love hearing from you.
[01:58:51.540 --> 01:58:54.980]   If you want to hear something in particular on Mac break weekly, just let us know.
[01:58:54.980 --> 01:58:58.620]   You can tweet us or visit us in the chat room.
[01:58:58.620 --> 01:59:01.060]   Really, it's part of the reason I love doing these shows.
[01:59:01.060 --> 01:59:03.660]   It's like getting to see the chat room.
[01:59:03.660 --> 01:59:04.660]   They're so great.
[01:59:04.660 --> 01:59:07.380]   You can join us in the chat room, but just go to twit.tv.
[01:59:07.380 --> 01:59:08.620]   There's a link there.
[01:59:08.620 --> 01:59:13.020]   If I were you, I would download a copy of a Mac chat client.
[01:59:13.020 --> 01:59:17.340]   I personally like Textual, which is on the App Store, but a lot of people like XChat
[01:59:17.340 --> 01:59:18.340]   Aqua.
[01:59:18.340 --> 01:59:20.020]   There's a number of good choices.
[01:59:20.020 --> 01:59:22.180]   Set it up for RIRC.
[01:59:22.180 --> 01:59:23.500]   It's irc.twit.tv.
[01:59:23.500 --> 01:59:25.500]   And just, you know what I do?
[01:59:25.500 --> 01:59:32.100]   I have a checkbox that says, "Just open the Twit Chat when you open the program."
[01:59:32.100 --> 01:59:33.300]   So I have it running all the time.
[01:59:33.300 --> 01:59:34.300]   It's so much fun.
[01:59:34.300 --> 01:59:38.700]   Thank you all you in the chat room, all of you who have listened and watched.
[01:59:38.700 --> 01:59:42.980]   And I hope you have a wonderful holiday and a great new year.
[01:59:42.980 --> 01:59:47.180]   And we'll see you back here in one week in 2013.
[01:59:47.180 --> 01:59:48.660]   Happy holidays, everybody.
[01:59:48.660 --> 01:59:52.100]   Now get back to work or your eggnog.
[01:59:52.100 --> 01:59:53.180]   Break time is over.
[01:59:53.180 --> 01:59:56.540]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:59:56.540 --> 01:59:59.880]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:59:59.880 --> 02:00:02.460]   (upbeat music)
[02:00:02.460 --> 02:00:04.880]   (upbeat music)
