[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:54.000]   And just back from CES, Mr. Renee Ritchie of iMore.com.
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.000]   You look good, you don't look too exhausted, I saw your cleanse on Instagram.
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   I put the retina iMac here, Leo, so I'm using that podcasting now, so you should have 5K of Renee.
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   Is that actually, I wasn't going to say anything, but it does look good.
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.000]   It does look really good.
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   It looks better.
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   You replace that Haswell, sorry, the Nihala Mac Pro so we can see how far we've come.
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   Wow.
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   It's actually sitting on top of the carcass of a Nihala Mac Pro right now.
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   I like it.
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   It looks good.
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   Anyway, welcome back.
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   We'll get your CES report in just a second.
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   Andy and Aco is also here.
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   Snowbound in Boston.
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   Andy.
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000]   Icebound, but that's okay.
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   We are a hearty pioneer stock.
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   Yes.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   Indeed.
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   And he's also at the Chicago Sun Times.
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   And look to fill in for Alex Lindsay this week.
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   Adam Anced from tidbits is here.
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   Hi Adam.
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   Hey, nice to see you Leo.
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   You're an upper New York state, I want to say.
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   Yeah, upstate New York, Ithaca, New York.
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   So centrally isolated, as our bumper stickers say.
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   Is that an actual penguin in there or is that just a replica?
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   You know, if you don't have a four foot penguin in your office, something's wrong.
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   I want to point out that is not a fake tux penguin.
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   That's an actual, you know, that is a real penguin model.
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   Ironically, it was brought to me by an Australian friend from Australia.
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   Is it an emperor penguin?
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   It is.
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   We must get these.
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   Life size scale.
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   Perfectly.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   Life size, look under its feet, see if it's harboring eggs because you don't want more.
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   That's for sure.
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   It's nothing worse than an infestation of little penguins.
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   Actually, that'd be awesome.
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   Actually, this is so awesome.
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   They'd be so happy here.
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   I want penguins for the Twit.
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   How's the studio?
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000]   I love that idea.
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   Little fuzzy little penguins.
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   Mr. Popper's penguins.
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   Yeah.
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   Right.
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   I grew up reading that.
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   It's a kid.
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   Adam Tittbitz is 24 years old celebrating the longest tenure, I think, of any Mac publication.
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   I don't know if it's, well, we will.
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   That's right.
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   We lost Macworld.
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   We lost Macworld, so you now are the king.
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   Well, there is Mac Tech, too.
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:03.000]   They have some claim to it.
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000]   I definitely have the oldest internet publication.
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   Yeah.
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   And Macworld is now an internet publication.
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   Yeah.
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   So, yeah.
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   The oldest internet publication.
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000]   Did you ever do a paper version of Tittbitz?
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   No.
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   No.
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:21.720]   Well, technically the first two issues of Tittbitz were laid out in paper back when Tanya was
[00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:26.760]   working at Cornell and sort of the initial idea was to help some of her co-workers keep
[00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:29.000]   up with what was happening in the Mac world.
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   Really?
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:31.000]   Yeah.
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   The page maker version lasted for two weeks.
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   That's the one that rest were at 1254 weeks.
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   Wow.
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:40.840]   - You knew.
[00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:41.860]   - And you knew Carpinket wise too.
[00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:44.780]   Wow, why is this one printer in this one office
[00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:47.440]   generating 8,000 pages every two weeks?
[00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:49.560]   (soft laughing)
[00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:50.400]   - Yeah, but it was the one,
[00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:51.560]   it was actually one of those, you know,
[00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:54.460]   the line feed printers with the holes on the side.
[00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:55.540]   - Timitz is a must read.
[00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:58.040]   If you aren't subscribing to it, do, it's free.
[00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:01.200]   But do support them with a little premium subscription.
[00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:03.400]   Throw a little little guy there away.
[00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:07.920]   So C-E-S and you at Timitz referred to Philip Michael's
[00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:11.560]   a wonderful piece in six colors.
[00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:13.400]   - Oh, that was just so perfect.
[00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:16.000]   I mean, Phil really, really pegged it in terms of,
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:20.520]   just the appropriate, frankly, mocking of C-E-S
[00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:23.600]   because C-E-S is such an institution
[00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:25.960]   that it deserves a certain level of mocking
[00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:29.040]   as well as some people to go and prostrate themselves
[00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:32.760]   and ruin their feet, as I'm sure Renee probably had to do.
[00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:34.460]   - He writes, C-E-S, which stands for,
[00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:37.780]   come on everybody, stuff is the largest gathering
[00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:40.380]   of the tech industry outside of a 4chan chat room.
[00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:42.440]   (laughing)
[00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:44.180]   Oh, with companies both large and small,
[00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:45.940]   have been to grab headlines with the latest gear and gadgets.
[00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:47.220]   How important is C-E-S?
[00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:49.680]   Well, it's the launching pad for such innovative,
[00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:52.260]   disruptive products as MySpaceTV,
[00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:55.240]   Lady Gaga's Polaroid Sunglasses camera,
[00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:57.960]   a transparent washing machine from higher,
[00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:01.260]   and glass up smart glasses.
[00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:03.500]   The none of these products every came into markets
[00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:06.360]   beside the point tech journalists get to see demos of them.
[00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:07.980]   And if you ever caught a glimpse of a unicorn,
[00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:11.060]   wouldn't you wanna tell people about it?
[00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:14.540]   It really, it actually is, they show Michael Bay's famous,
[00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:16.740]   abandonment of the Samsung presentation last year.
[00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:19.380]   Nothing bad like that happened this year, I don't think.
[00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:23.660]   But yeah, this is, and this was before C-E-S.
[00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:26.660]   He wrote this up, how to repair you.
[00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:28.100]   He was right about a few things.
[00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:29.660]   There were a lot of drones.
[00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:31.780]   - Yep.
[00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:34.020]   - The drone demos move indoors as we embrace
[00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:35.660]   our new drone-centric future
[00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:38.720]   from high above the C-E-S show floor drones will swoop down
[00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:40.720]   on the attendees below giving people a bird's eye view
[00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:42.520]   of the sights and sounds of C-E-S,
[00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:44.840]   while also capturing the up close reactions
[00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:47.960]   of surprised onlookers and unaware passers-by.
[00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:51.840]   There will be no survivors, so nice article.
[00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:53.360]   - But Renee actually went,
[00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:57.480]   and what mobile nations teamed up with Geekbeat TV
[00:06:57.480 --> 00:07:01.840]   and Tom's hardware, and you had round the clock coverage.
[00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:03.820]   - Yeah, we took your old spot in South Hall,
[00:07:03.820 --> 00:07:07.480]   put up a stage and broadcast every day for five days.
[00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:08.520]   We survived, Leo.
[00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:13.520]   - And Serenity showed her star power and her stamina.
[00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:16.220]   - Yeah, we had Georgia Serenity, myself,
[00:07:16.220 --> 00:07:17.780]   and Anthony, our videographer from Iamore,
[00:07:17.780 --> 00:07:20.000]   then we had Android Central, Windows Central,
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:21.360]   connectedly, a whole bunch of--
[00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:22.200]   - Amazing.
[00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:23.040]   - Yeah.
[00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:25.560]   - So is there, I mean, Apple doesn't go to C-E-S.
[00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:27.120]   There's always been a poof.
[00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:27.960]   - Oh, they do.
[00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:30.120]   - Not officially, so they have like store buyers
[00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:31.320]   will go to see what they might want to put
[00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:32.400]   in the Apple store next year,
[00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:35.620]   and there's people who go there doing competitive analysis.
[00:07:35.620 --> 00:07:36.460]   - But I think they're there to see
[00:07:36.460 --> 00:07:38.620]   what the other folks are doing, not to announce stuff.
[00:07:38.620 --> 00:07:39.460]   - Well, and to see, I mean,
[00:07:39.460 --> 00:07:40.860]   everyone's interested in seeing trends
[00:07:40.860 --> 00:07:42.980]   or seeing like there's a lot of accessory people there.
[00:07:42.980 --> 00:07:44.580]   This year, particularly, there was CarPlay,
[00:07:44.580 --> 00:07:46.340]   there was HomeKit, there was HealthKit,
[00:07:46.340 --> 00:07:47.660]   and they probably want to sneak a peek
[00:07:47.660 --> 00:07:49.140]   at what, you know, what the people are doing
[00:07:49.140 --> 00:07:51.060]   with those technologies.
[00:07:51.060 --> 00:07:53.820]   - So there were, there actually was a lot of CarPlay stuff
[00:07:53.820 --> 00:07:55.700]   at C-E-S, I know you were looking for that.
[00:07:55.700 --> 00:07:57.460]   Tell us about that.
[00:07:57.460 --> 00:08:00.020]   - The CarPlay, so I'm with two minds about the CarPlay stuff.
[00:08:00.020 --> 00:08:01.500]   I really love it because,
[00:08:01.500 --> 00:08:02.680]   and I've told the story before,
[00:08:02.680 --> 00:08:03.920]   my car, I can't upgrade.
[00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:05.960]   No matter what I do, I have to buy a new car
[00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:08.360]   to improve the in-dash entertainment,
[00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:09.800]   the infotainment system in it.
[00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:11.280]   But once I get a CarPlay car,
[00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:12.520]   every time I update my phone,
[00:08:12.520 --> 00:08:14.080]   every time I update iOS,
[00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:15.760]   that's gonna update the functionality
[00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:17.760]   of the infotainment system.
[00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:19.520]   If I get overcast on my phone,
[00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:22.160]   I can have overcast on the CarPlay system,
[00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:24.160]   and it means that I don't have to learn a new system
[00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:25.080]   every time I get in a car.
[00:08:25.080 --> 00:08:27.440]   It's just all my data, all my content,
[00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:29.840]   all my stuff and an interface that I'm familiar with.
[00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:30.960]   And we're getting to the point
[00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:32.580]   where they're starting to implement that well.
[00:08:32.580 --> 00:08:34.300]   They're getting better touchscreen technology.
[00:08:34.300 --> 00:08:35.620]   Some of them are still using knobs,
[00:08:35.620 --> 00:08:38.340]   but in general, from car to car to car,
[00:08:38.340 --> 00:08:39.660]   if I'm an iPhone user,
[00:08:39.660 --> 00:08:41.340]   I just get an iPhone experience.
[00:08:41.340 --> 00:08:43.420]   And I think that's hugely valuable.
[00:08:43.420 --> 00:08:45.940]   'Cause cars never have consistent interfaces.
[00:08:45.940 --> 00:08:47.980]   You can get two cars from the same manufacturer,
[00:08:47.980 --> 00:08:49.620]   and you have to learn how to use them
[00:08:49.620 --> 00:08:50.860]   every time you get into one.
[00:08:50.860 --> 00:08:52.540]   And that can be perplexing for people.
[00:08:52.540 --> 00:08:55.060]   And I think it's great if we can just have our stuff with us.
[00:08:55.060 --> 00:08:57.220]   - Hey, we're all, I know Alpine and Pioneer Head
[00:08:57.220 --> 00:08:59.620]   and pre-announced aftermarket car play.
[00:08:59.620 --> 00:09:00.700]   Were there other aftermarket?
[00:09:00.700 --> 00:09:03.820]   So if I don't have car play in my existing car,
[00:09:03.820 --> 00:09:05.360]   I can add it, although it looks like
[00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:07.820]   it's kind of a non-standard dashboard.
[00:09:07.820 --> 00:09:09.120]   - I think you have to have a too high.
[00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:11.860]   I forget what it's called, but a double height unit
[00:09:11.860 --> 00:09:13.020]   in order to put it in.
[00:09:13.020 --> 00:09:14.900]   But we're gonna test some of those.
[00:09:14.900 --> 00:09:15.900]   Yeah, those are coming out.
[00:09:15.900 --> 00:09:17.220]   Some people find them expensive,
[00:09:17.220 --> 00:09:19.820]   but again, it's basically the price of connectivity
[00:09:19.820 --> 00:09:20.660]   at this point.
[00:09:20.660 --> 00:09:23.580]   Hopefully you ask people upgrade their cars.
[00:09:23.580 --> 00:09:24.620]   Yeah, the car play stuff's all interesting.
[00:09:24.620 --> 00:09:27.340]   I like the home kit stuff, frankly, much better this year.
[00:09:27.340 --> 00:09:28.780]   - That I wanna hear about a lot.
[00:09:28.780 --> 00:09:30.940]   In fact, didn't we say, please go over
[00:09:30.940 --> 00:09:33.820]   to the home automation pavilion and see what's up?
[00:09:33.820 --> 00:09:35.860]   - Yeah, and I mean, so a lot of them were sort of,
[00:09:35.860 --> 00:09:37.540]   "Oh, we're waiting on Apple.
[00:09:37.540 --> 00:09:38.460]   "We're not sure."
[00:09:38.460 --> 00:09:40.140]   But there were several people, like in CIPIO,
[00:09:40.140 --> 00:09:40.980]   I was blown away.
[00:09:40.980 --> 00:09:42.820]   We went to the in CIPIO booth and they're like,
[00:09:42.820 --> 00:09:44.900]   "Hell yeah, home kit is awesome."
[00:09:44.900 --> 00:09:47.100]   And they picked up an iPhone and they said,
[00:09:47.100 --> 00:09:48.740]   "Lights on," and the lights turned on.
[00:09:48.740 --> 00:09:49.940]   They said, "Outlet on."
[00:09:49.940 --> 00:09:51.460]   And the fan just pulled up.
[00:09:51.460 --> 00:09:52.500]   They said, "In CIPIO off."
[00:09:52.500 --> 00:09:55.140]   And everything connected to their system went off.
[00:09:55.140 --> 00:09:56.380]   And they said it was great to use
[00:09:56.380 --> 00:09:58.500]   because now instead of having all these little
[00:09:58.500 --> 00:10:01.660]   fiefdoms of different home automation technology
[00:10:01.660 --> 00:10:03.500]   and a folder full of apps,
[00:10:03.500 --> 00:10:05.580]   they just made their app compatible with home kit.
[00:10:05.580 --> 00:10:07.740]   You can go into it, you can set up homes
[00:10:07.740 --> 00:10:10.180]   and rooms and zones and activities.
[00:10:10.180 --> 00:10:11.980]   And I have this dream Leo that'll be able to pick up
[00:10:11.980 --> 00:10:14.740]   Siri one day and just say, "Crash the compound."
[00:10:14.740 --> 00:10:16.740]   And everything will slam closed around me
[00:10:16.740 --> 00:10:19.340]   and I can just watch TV and drink my beverage in peace.
[00:10:19.340 --> 00:10:20.180]   - Yeah.
[00:10:20.180 --> 00:10:22.740]   - Let's just announce some really good connectivity
[00:10:22.740 --> 00:10:24.300]   with the certain automotive apps
[00:10:24.300 --> 00:10:28.100]   so that now your nest at home will be aware that,
[00:10:28.100 --> 00:10:29.980]   oh, he's driving home right now.
[00:10:29.980 --> 00:10:31.540]   I need to start warming up the house
[00:10:31.540 --> 00:10:34.020]   because he is, according to his current ETA,
[00:10:34.020 --> 00:10:35.780]   he will be home in exactly 18 minutes.
[00:10:35.780 --> 00:10:38.500]   It takes 15 minutes for the house to get up to temperature.
[00:10:38.500 --> 00:10:40.580]   So I'll start cracking up the heat right now.
[00:10:40.580 --> 00:10:42.180]   And that's the sort of stuff that are--
[00:10:42.180 --> 00:10:43.980]   - And now you can fluff your,
[00:10:43.980 --> 00:10:46.420]   the nest will make your dryer fluff your clothes for you
[00:10:46.420 --> 00:10:47.820]   when you're about ready to get up.
[00:10:47.820 --> 00:10:49.900]   - And also make like the lamps in your bedroom
[00:10:49.900 --> 00:10:52.260]   just sort of dimmed down and then up again to alert
[00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:54.820]   your spouse at perhaps it's time to get the UPS driver
[00:10:54.820 --> 00:10:55.740]   back on his way.
[00:10:55.740 --> 00:10:57.060]   (laughing)
[00:10:57.060 --> 00:10:59.020]   Make sure the truck is out of sight.
[00:10:59.020 --> 00:11:00.100]   Good, Ryan. - I'd be really interested
[00:11:00.100 --> 00:11:01.860]   to see some of this stuff.
[00:11:01.860 --> 00:11:04.820]   We actually just replaced a 19 year old car
[00:11:04.820 --> 00:11:06.060]   and a 13 year old car.
[00:11:06.060 --> 00:11:08.660]   So we've gone from having the technology in our cars
[00:11:08.660 --> 00:11:12.100]   being cassette players to a full bore,
[00:11:12.100 --> 00:11:14.420]   forward collision of warning and avoidance
[00:11:14.420 --> 00:11:15.700]   and all that kind of stuff.
[00:11:15.700 --> 00:11:19.620]   And it has been just a huge, huge learning curve
[00:11:19.620 --> 00:11:21.420]   to figure out all the different things
[00:11:21.420 --> 00:11:23.300]   and look for the settings and figure out
[00:11:23.300 --> 00:11:24.940]   to get the map pointing the right direction
[00:11:24.940 --> 00:11:26.060]   and all that kind of stuff.
[00:11:26.060 --> 00:11:29.580]   So, but car play has been fairly in inscrutable
[00:11:29.580 --> 00:11:30.420]   up to this point.
[00:11:30.420 --> 00:11:34.220]   So, I'm really curious to see what that ends up looking like.
[00:11:34.220 --> 00:11:36.020]   And the home cut thing for me,
[00:11:36.020 --> 00:11:39.620]   I'm not so interested actually in the specific commands.
[00:11:39.620 --> 00:11:41.900]   I wanna see a lot of proximity things go on.
[00:11:41.900 --> 00:11:44.580]   So, when I walk into a room with my phone in my pocket
[00:11:44.580 --> 00:11:45.940]   turn the lights on.
[00:11:45.940 --> 00:11:46.780]   So I don't have to,
[00:11:46.780 --> 00:11:48.340]   if I have to pull my phone out and say,
[00:11:48.340 --> 00:11:51.380]   "Ciri, turn the lights on, it's easier to touch the light switch."
[00:11:51.380 --> 00:11:53.300]   There's a tech I've had a rundown
[00:11:53.300 --> 00:11:55.740]   of every home kit compatible device.
[00:11:55.740 --> 00:11:58.980]   They saw it CES Elgato, a long time,
[00:11:58.980 --> 00:12:02.820]   Max Dahlward has a new line called Eve,
[00:12:02.820 --> 00:12:04.620]   the Eve door and window sensor,
[00:12:04.620 --> 00:12:07.940]   Bluetooth LE battery last six months.
[00:12:07.940 --> 00:12:09.500]   I don't really wanna have to go around the house
[00:12:09.500 --> 00:12:11.540]   and change the batteries on sensors,
[00:12:11.540 --> 00:12:14.500]   but that sounds really grim.
[00:12:14.500 --> 00:12:16.340]   - You do it for your smoke detectors
[00:12:16.340 --> 00:12:18.100]   and every other device in your house.
[00:12:18.100 --> 00:12:18.940]   - Yeah.
[00:12:18.940 --> 00:12:19.780]   - Yeah.
[00:12:19.780 --> 00:12:20.620]   - That's where you're wrong.
[00:12:20.620 --> 00:12:22.660]   The beauty of this is it runs on AC power.
[00:12:22.660 --> 00:12:24.820]   So all you need is to have an outlet
[00:12:24.820 --> 00:12:26.900]   underneath every single window.
[00:12:26.900 --> 00:12:28.780]   - There's a great story from Ecobee.
[00:12:28.780 --> 00:12:30.220]   They do something very similar to Nest,
[00:12:30.220 --> 00:12:31.540]   but they have sensors in every room.
[00:12:31.540 --> 00:12:33.180]   So as you move to different rooms in your house,
[00:12:33.180 --> 00:12:35.580]   it can adjust those rooms automatically for you.
[00:12:35.580 --> 00:12:37.020]   And it keeps track of the people in it
[00:12:37.020 --> 00:12:38.300]   and the guy, the spokesperson,
[00:12:38.300 --> 00:12:40.020]   we were interviewing said that at one point
[00:12:40.020 --> 00:12:41.580]   he was out of the country and his Ecobee
[00:12:41.580 --> 00:12:44.260]   just showed more and more people entering into the rooms
[00:12:44.260 --> 00:12:46.260]   and he called home and he said, "Honey, deer,
[00:12:46.260 --> 00:12:47.100]   are you having a party?"
[00:12:47.100 --> 00:12:47.940]   - He was having a party.
[00:12:47.940 --> 00:12:50.580]   - Yeah, she said, "No, no, I swear to add no."
[00:12:50.580 --> 00:12:51.900]   Well, what was it?
[00:12:51.900 --> 00:12:53.100]   - It was a party, absolutely.
[00:12:53.100 --> 00:12:53.940]   (laughing)
[00:12:53.940 --> 00:12:55.260]   - Uh huh.
[00:12:55.260 --> 00:12:56.500]   - Busted.
[00:12:56.500 --> 00:12:58.060]   There's a new use for a sensor.
[00:12:58.060 --> 00:12:59.420]   - But you have to be aware,
[00:12:59.420 --> 00:13:01.340]   this has got to be a marketing problem.
[00:13:01.340 --> 00:13:03.020]   Like what, there are demonstrations
[00:13:03.020 --> 00:13:04.860]   that absolutely prove how wonderful
[00:13:04.860 --> 00:13:06.860]   and how sophisticated this technology is,
[00:13:06.860 --> 00:13:09.580]   but nonetheless, it creeps people the hell out.
[00:13:09.580 --> 00:13:13.820]   - I think also, people see, it seems like a good idea.
[00:13:13.820 --> 00:13:16.300]   People aren't, you think people are gonna really do this?
[00:13:16.300 --> 00:13:17.460]   - They'll do it for the entertainment stuff.
[00:13:17.460 --> 00:13:19.500]   Like they'll get the lights, they'll get the Sonos system,
[00:13:19.500 --> 00:13:20.580]   they'll get the home theater stuff,
[00:13:20.580 --> 00:13:23.100]   and then slowly as that proves valuable to them,
[00:13:23.100 --> 00:13:24.100]   they'll get into the more boring things.
[00:13:24.100 --> 00:13:25.420]   - It's always kind of a stretch, like,
[00:13:25.420 --> 00:13:27.780]   oh, I want the thermostat to turn up when I'm on my way home,
[00:13:27.780 --> 00:13:30.180]   or, I mean, it feels like a stretch.
[00:13:30.180 --> 00:13:31.860]   Like something you don't, you could live without.
[00:13:31.860 --> 00:13:33.460]   - I'm like the same time.
[00:13:33.460 --> 00:13:34.780]   You could just schedule it.
[00:13:34.780 --> 00:13:36.700]   I mean, this stuff--
[00:13:36.700 --> 00:13:39.900]   - I do schedule, I have a, like an old fashioned thermostat.
[00:13:39.900 --> 00:13:40.740]   - Right.
[00:13:40.740 --> 00:13:41.740]   - And I schedule it.
[00:13:41.740 --> 00:13:43.980]   - Right, and I mean, or for instance,
[00:13:43.980 --> 00:13:46.140]   we have geothermal heat with a radiant floor,
[00:13:46.140 --> 00:13:48.300]   so we set our thermostat to 69
[00:13:48.300 --> 00:13:50.420]   and leave it there all winter.
[00:13:50.420 --> 00:13:51.260]   - Right.
[00:13:51.260 --> 00:13:53.740]   - So, actually, that is extremely complicated,
[00:13:53.740 --> 00:13:55.540]   and we just never change it, because--
[00:13:55.540 --> 00:13:56.380]   (laughing)
[00:13:56.380 --> 00:13:58.460]   - Just like which does automated locks
[00:13:58.460 --> 00:14:01.100]   will have a home kit compatible lock.
[00:14:01.100 --> 00:14:05.180]   So you walk up, Bluetooth LA will unlock the door for you.
[00:14:05.180 --> 00:14:08.860]   - But think about how you've been replacing
[00:14:08.860 --> 00:14:10.460]   LED light bulbs around your house.
[00:14:10.460 --> 00:14:13.460]   You didn't decide to simply swap out everything all at once.
[00:14:13.460 --> 00:14:14.300]   It was like-- - Gradually.
[00:14:14.300 --> 00:14:15.740]   - Yeah, exactly.
[00:14:15.740 --> 00:14:17.660]   I start off with this one light
[00:14:17.660 --> 00:14:19.660]   that's in the kitchen that has to really has to say
[00:14:19.660 --> 00:14:22.300]   on all the time, and now pretty much--
[00:14:22.300 --> 00:14:24.100]   Every time a bulb burns out,
[00:14:24.100 --> 00:14:25.540]   I just replace with something else.
[00:14:25.540 --> 00:14:27.060]   It's got-- HomeKit's gonna be like that,
[00:14:27.060 --> 00:14:29.300]   where I think the first thing that people are gonna buy
[00:14:29.300 --> 00:14:30.780]   is something like a Nest thermostat,
[00:14:30.780 --> 00:14:32.540]   because it will save you money.
[00:14:32.540 --> 00:14:33.460]   It is easy to use.
[00:14:33.460 --> 00:14:35.780]   It's very cool to interact with,
[00:14:35.780 --> 00:14:38.580]   and then over the course of five or 10 years,
[00:14:38.580 --> 00:14:40.540]   every time you buy something brand new,
[00:14:40.540 --> 00:14:42.860]   if it has that home kit functionality,
[00:14:42.860 --> 00:14:45.900]   and it's within $10 to $20 of whatever else
[00:14:45.900 --> 00:14:47.640]   you're considering the cost 200 bucks,
[00:14:47.640 --> 00:14:49.740]   maybe you'll wind up with this wonderful network
[00:14:49.740 --> 00:14:52.460]   of just incidental purchases over the next five years.
[00:14:52.460 --> 00:14:57.140]   - I actually did a lot of this stuff back in the mid '90s.
[00:14:57.140 --> 00:14:59.780]   A friend of mine, and Keith Ronholm in Seattle,
[00:14:59.780 --> 00:15:01.780]   had actually started a company that did a lot of--
[00:15:01.780 --> 00:15:03.900]   He had a box that you put with Mac software,
[00:15:03.900 --> 00:15:06.100]   and you could attach sensors to it,
[00:15:06.100 --> 00:15:08.420]   and he had software that you could control all the sensors,
[00:15:08.420 --> 00:15:09.940]   and you could control X10 devices.
[00:15:09.940 --> 00:15:11.860]   So you could do all the home automation stuff.
[00:15:11.860 --> 00:15:15.060]   And he gave me one of the boxes to play with,
[00:15:15.060 --> 00:15:16.460]   and I got some bunch of sensors,
[00:15:16.460 --> 00:15:18.040]   and a bunch of X10 devices,
[00:15:18.040 --> 00:15:19.280]   and it was fun to play with,
[00:15:19.280 --> 00:15:22.440]   but honestly when we moved, and the software,
[00:15:22.440 --> 00:15:25.680]   I think it was, gosh, Mac was eight, I forget.
[00:15:25.680 --> 00:15:27.920]   It never moved forward.
[00:15:27.920 --> 00:15:29.720]   It completely fell by the wayside.
[00:15:29.720 --> 00:15:30.920]   It wasn't something that I ever--
[00:15:30.920 --> 00:15:32.000]   - I need it.
[00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:34.280]   Yeah, I have hue lights, and when we moved,
[00:15:34.280 --> 00:15:35.920]   I had a hue and a nest.
[00:15:35.920 --> 00:15:38.720]   We moved, I just didn't bother hooking them up.
[00:15:38.720 --> 00:15:41.680]   - It really is up to people's comfort level.
[00:15:41.680 --> 00:15:44.960]   It was really great once I got my first smart lights,
[00:15:44.960 --> 00:15:47.240]   and just the ability to turn on certain lights,
[00:15:47.240 --> 00:15:48.460]   I'd sundown, and then--
[00:15:48.460 --> 00:15:50.300]   - Yeah, love that.
[00:15:50.300 --> 00:15:51.840]   - On it sundown them back again.
[00:15:51.840 --> 00:15:53.720]   But I always come back to this.
[00:15:53.720 --> 00:15:56.880]   My favorite story about people adopting technology
[00:15:56.880 --> 00:15:58.560]   and finding their own comfort level
[00:15:58.560 --> 00:16:02.960]   has to do when I had taken over the Christmas decorating
[00:16:02.960 --> 00:16:04.680]   at my mom and dad's house.
[00:16:04.680 --> 00:16:07.000]   And of course, I switched over to,
[00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:08.960]   after two or three years, to X10 lighting,
[00:16:08.960 --> 00:16:12.040]   because I could just leave this remote on the nightstand,
[00:16:12.040 --> 00:16:13.520]   that they could just push one button,
[00:16:13.520 --> 00:16:15.440]   and all the Christmas tree lights came on,
[00:16:15.440 --> 00:16:16.640]   the window lights came on,
[00:16:16.640 --> 00:16:18.840]   the outside stuff came on.
[00:16:18.840 --> 00:16:21.440]   And the first time I set this up,
[00:16:21.440 --> 00:16:23.640]   my mom was so excited about it.
[00:16:23.640 --> 00:16:24.840]   She thought it was the coolest thing.
[00:16:24.840 --> 00:16:26.200]   And I was like, oh, you, I don't have to go from
[00:16:26.200 --> 00:16:27.560]   like window to window and plug it on.
[00:16:27.560 --> 00:16:28.800]   Oh, this is wonderful.
[00:16:28.800 --> 00:16:32.040]   And then so I tentatively said, well, you know, mom.
[00:16:32.040 --> 00:16:34.560]   And I know that I'm entering the danger zone.
[00:16:34.560 --> 00:16:38.280]   I could set this up so that it turns on automatically
[00:16:38.280 --> 00:16:41.920]   at a certain time, and then turns off at late at night.
[00:16:41.920 --> 00:16:45.000]   And that's the point which she was like, she was out.
[00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:47.160]   'Cause that was the house will burn down
[00:16:47.160 --> 00:16:49.480]   if I have a computer turning this on and off,
[00:16:49.480 --> 00:16:51.760]   but you like the ability to press the button herself
[00:16:51.760 --> 00:16:52.600]   and do that.
[00:16:52.600 --> 00:16:54.360]   - Eye devices, I like that.
[00:16:54.360 --> 00:16:56.320]   - Eye devices, I use their eye grill,
[00:16:56.320 --> 00:17:00.920]   which I really like, has invested $10 million in HomeKit.
[00:17:00.920 --> 00:17:02.880]   First product is a connected plugs,
[00:17:02.880 --> 00:17:05.360]   the switch that has a--
[00:17:05.360 --> 00:17:06.200]   - Aim high.
[00:17:06.200 --> 00:17:08.000]   - 10, you can pull on, man.
[00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:08.840]   - The switches are interesting,
[00:17:08.840 --> 00:17:09.760]   and Sipio has them too,
[00:17:09.760 --> 00:17:11.600]   because you can take any gadget you have,
[00:17:11.600 --> 00:17:13.680]   like a fan, like a little heater,
[00:17:13.680 --> 00:17:15.120]   like a telekim that was anything you want to use.
[00:17:15.120 --> 00:17:16.520]   - That was X10 20 years ago.
[00:17:16.520 --> 00:17:19.880]   - Yeah, but my little six year old niggazan
[00:17:19.880 --> 00:17:21.360]   is not gonna use X10, but he's very,
[00:17:21.360 --> 00:17:22.880]   you love Siri, Siri's his best friend.
[00:17:22.880 --> 00:17:24.280]   You'll talk to Siri all day long.
[00:17:24.280 --> 00:17:25.120]   (laughing)
[00:17:25.120 --> 00:17:25.960]   That kind of stuff.
[00:17:25.960 --> 00:17:29.720]   - Shipping an April $50 for the switch.
[00:17:29.720 --> 00:17:30.560]   Let's see what else.
[00:17:30.560 --> 00:17:31.600]   Eye Home, you mentioned Eye Home,
[00:17:31.600 --> 00:17:33.320]   this smart plug, same idea.
[00:17:33.320 --> 00:17:37.080]   $39 a second quarter.
[00:17:37.080 --> 00:17:40.920]   Blue Maestro, the tempo environment monitor, oh, Lord.
[00:17:40.920 --> 00:17:42.200]   (laughing)
[00:17:42.200 --> 00:17:43.960]   Keeps track on the temperature, humidity,
[00:17:43.960 --> 00:17:45.160]   and barometric pressure.
[00:17:45.160 --> 00:17:47.040]   Does it change a lot in the home?
[00:17:47.040 --> 00:17:48.440]   I guess it does.
[00:17:48.440 --> 00:17:50.360]   So you can keep tabs on conditions in the nursery.
[00:17:50.360 --> 00:17:53.160]   Oh my God, the pressure has gone up in the nursery.
[00:17:53.160 --> 00:17:54.800]   Quick, get the baby out.
[00:17:54.800 --> 00:17:56.800]   - I think a lot of stuff will be turbulence
[00:17:56.800 --> 00:17:58.960]   and way too much in wackiness and silliness
[00:17:58.960 --> 00:17:59.800]   for a couple of years.
[00:17:59.800 --> 00:18:00.640]   Then it'll stabilize,
[00:18:00.640 --> 00:18:02.320]   and it'll be a bunch of really elegant sort of--
[00:18:02.320 --> 00:18:04.560]   - You know, smart watches kind of have won me
[00:18:04.560 --> 00:18:07.200]   a little bit, I was very skeptical.
[00:18:07.200 --> 00:18:08.640]   So maybe, you know, maybe.
[00:18:09.920 --> 00:18:12.440]   - It's all part about everything you buy,
[00:18:12.440 --> 00:18:14.640]   being able to enhance, be another brick
[00:18:14.640 --> 00:18:17.040]   that builds this much bigger, bigger system.
[00:18:17.040 --> 00:18:19.720]   Once you start watching, wearing a smart watch,
[00:18:19.720 --> 00:18:21.800]   and you realize that, oh, it would be really nice
[00:18:21.800 --> 00:18:23.920]   if I'm walking through a room and I realize that, oh,
[00:18:23.920 --> 00:18:25.560]   that light's been on for three hours too,
[00:18:25.560 --> 00:18:28.520]   just simply do this as opposed to pick up your phone
[00:18:28.520 --> 00:18:29.360]   and do something like that.
[00:18:29.360 --> 00:18:30.520]   - Is there a killer app?
[00:18:30.520 --> 00:18:32.440]   'Cause that would do it, right?
[00:18:32.440 --> 00:18:34.400]   The killer app that gets everybody to buy the hub
[00:18:34.400 --> 00:18:37.240]   and get in, and then you could slowly, gradually upgrade.
[00:18:37.240 --> 00:18:39.680]   What is the killer app, a garage door opener?
[00:18:39.680 --> 00:18:42.200]   - No, it's gonna be, there's gonna be a killer app,
[00:18:42.200 --> 00:18:43.760]   it's gonna be a confluence of many little things
[00:18:43.760 --> 00:18:45.480]   when you finally can do that thing, like,
[00:18:45.480 --> 00:18:46.360]   you know, Siri, good night,
[00:18:46.360 --> 00:18:48.040]   and you know for sure your garage doors close
[00:18:48.040 --> 00:18:49.400]   and your lights are off and you're--
[00:18:49.400 --> 00:18:51.320]   - Yeah, but how long do you have to do that
[00:18:51.320 --> 00:18:54.240]   before you get up every time, just to make sure, right?
[00:18:54.240 --> 00:18:56.200]   - I think actually, Andy's got it though,
[00:18:56.200 --> 00:18:58.600]   and there's a smart watch, maybe, the trick,
[00:18:58.600 --> 00:19:01.040]   because if you have to pull your iPhone out of your pocket
[00:19:01.040 --> 00:19:03.200]   to talk to Siri, to turn on the light,
[00:19:03.200 --> 00:19:05.040]   you're not gonna do it.
[00:19:05.040 --> 00:19:06.320]   Even if you have to walk across the room,
[00:19:06.320 --> 00:19:07.880]   it's just easier to walk across the room.
[00:19:07.880 --> 00:19:11.400]   However, if it's on your wrist and you can just say,
[00:19:11.400 --> 00:19:13.160]   turn on the lighting on the light,
[00:19:13.160 --> 00:19:16.360]   maybe that is enough easier that you will actually do it
[00:19:16.360 --> 00:19:18.920]   rather than taking the extra three steps.
[00:19:18.920 --> 00:19:21.080]   - It also does action, so you can--
[00:19:21.080 --> 00:19:23.760]   - Also, also, if the fact that you have a low-power
[00:19:23.760 --> 00:19:26.640]   Bluetooth beacon on your wrist gives it the granularity
[00:19:26.640 --> 00:19:28.400]   to say that not only is Andy in this room,
[00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:30.680]   but he is sitting down in this chair
[00:19:30.680 --> 00:19:32.200]   where he often does reading,
[00:19:32.200 --> 00:19:33.400]   so I will turn on the light.
[00:19:33.400 --> 00:19:35.080]   - I think the proximity's gonna be huge.
[00:19:35.080 --> 00:19:37.080]   I mean, if it can really tell where you are,
[00:19:37.080 --> 00:19:39.880]   and you can say, whenever I do this, turn on a light.
[00:19:39.880 --> 00:19:42.360]   Again, turn on a light if I walk into this room
[00:19:42.360 --> 00:19:45.400]   between the out, when my sensor outside
[00:19:45.400 --> 00:19:48.160]   tells me that it's sufficiently dim, that kind of thing.
[00:19:48.160 --> 00:19:51.040]   - It's not just, I'm sorry, I didn't wrap, I'm sorry.
[00:19:51.040 --> 00:19:54.320]   - No, it's just, basically, it's gonna do what I want,
[00:19:54.320 --> 00:19:55.880]   not what I tell it.
[00:19:55.880 --> 00:19:57.640]   - But the killer app, I think,
[00:19:57.640 --> 00:19:59.960]   is gonna be something like Google Now functionality,
[00:19:59.960 --> 00:20:01.880]   where I don't have to program it to say,
[00:20:01.880 --> 00:20:04.440]   "Well, if I'm inside this room between four and eight
[00:20:04.440 --> 00:20:05.880]   "and I'm sitting in this chair,
[00:20:05.880 --> 00:20:09.080]   "it should be, gee, it's seven out of nine times
[00:20:09.080 --> 00:20:11.320]   "that he sits in this chair at this time of day.
[00:20:11.320 --> 00:20:13.200]   "He winds up using the watch or the phone
[00:20:13.200 --> 00:20:14.760]   "to turn on this light."
[00:20:14.760 --> 00:20:18.920]   So if I sense that he's making his way from here to there,
[00:20:18.920 --> 00:20:21.640]   I'm going to gradually turn that light on,
[00:20:21.640 --> 00:20:23.960]   and he can easily turn it off if he doesn't want it,
[00:20:23.960 --> 00:20:25.320]   but if he doesn't turn it off,
[00:20:25.320 --> 00:20:26.760]   then I will also learn that, yes,
[00:20:26.760 --> 00:20:29.720]   we should definitely have this light now waiting for him
[00:20:29.720 --> 00:20:31.200]   when he enters the house.
[00:20:31.200 --> 00:20:33.800]   Stuff like that where just magically you didn't tell
[00:20:33.800 --> 00:20:35.640]   about the things that you really wanted to do.
[00:20:35.640 --> 00:20:37.200]   It just figured it out on the sound.
[00:20:37.200 --> 00:20:38.960]   Just like you don't hire somebody
[00:20:38.960 --> 00:20:41.040]   because they're really good at doing the stuff
[00:20:41.040 --> 00:20:42.440]   you tell them to do.
[00:20:42.440 --> 00:20:44.080]   He's a good hire or she's a good hire
[00:20:44.080 --> 00:20:46.400]   because they figure out what needs to be done
[00:20:46.400 --> 00:20:48.560]   in this office without you telling them every single step.
[00:20:48.560 --> 00:20:49.920]   - One of the really nice things about it though
[00:20:49.920 --> 00:20:51.280]   is with HomeKit you can do actions
[00:20:51.280 --> 00:20:52.640]   and you can string actions together.
[00:20:52.640 --> 00:20:54.720]   So for example, I can have an action that I can say,
[00:20:54.720 --> 00:20:55.800]   "Ciri, game on."
[00:20:55.800 --> 00:20:57.400]   And suddenly my speakers come on,
[00:20:57.400 --> 00:20:59.760]   it goes to immediately to the Xbox channel.
[00:20:59.760 --> 00:21:01.720]   The lights go red and silver.
[00:21:01.720 --> 00:21:04.200]   Anything that would take several different discrete actions,
[00:21:04.200 --> 00:21:05.480]   especially for young kids,
[00:21:05.480 --> 00:21:08.680]   I was talking to a friend of mine who was babysitting
[00:21:08.680 --> 00:21:10.840]   and she was like, "The kids wanted to watch Netflix
[00:21:10.840 --> 00:21:11.680]   and I don't have that."
[00:21:11.680 --> 00:21:12.520]   And I'm like, "Yeah, you do.
[00:21:12.520 --> 00:21:14.320]   It's on 19 different boxes to add to your TV."
[00:21:14.320 --> 00:21:15.960]   And she's like, "I don't know how to find Netflix."
[00:21:15.960 --> 00:21:17.920]   But you could just say to your watch Netflix time
[00:21:17.920 --> 00:21:20.280]   and the TV goes to the right channel and everything.
[00:21:20.280 --> 00:21:22.400]   For normal people, computers and home automation
[00:21:22.400 --> 00:21:24.280]   are still horrible interfaces.
[00:21:24.280 --> 00:21:26.200]   And we talk about accessibility.
[00:21:26.200 --> 00:21:27.680]   It's great, you can have people who are blind
[00:21:27.680 --> 00:21:28.520]   finally use this stuff,
[00:21:28.520 --> 00:21:30.080]   but it can also be people who aren't familiar
[00:21:30.080 --> 00:21:32.600]   with technology finally have access to the stuff.
[00:21:32.600 --> 00:21:34.920]   And I think that's where natural language interfaces
[00:21:34.920 --> 00:21:37.360]   were, the kind of simplicity and uniformity
[00:21:37.360 --> 00:21:38.760]   really pay off for us.
[00:21:38.760 --> 00:21:40.560]   - The other problem is that I,
[00:21:40.560 --> 00:21:44.320]   maybe you guys have had the same sort of experiences
[00:21:44.320 --> 00:21:45.160]   that I have that.
[00:21:45.160 --> 00:21:47.360]   The one way to make somebody think,
[00:21:47.360 --> 00:21:49.200]   convince someone, "My God, this person
[00:21:49.200 --> 00:21:51.320]   is an absolute Mac genius.
[00:21:51.320 --> 00:21:53.720]   I had no idea such things were possible.
[00:21:53.720 --> 00:21:56.200]   He's some sort of wizard is when you introduce them
[00:21:56.200 --> 00:21:57.160]   to Automator."
[00:21:57.160 --> 00:22:00.440]   And say, "Here's how easy, show me something
[00:22:00.440 --> 00:22:01.920]   that you do that takes several steps
[00:22:01.920 --> 00:22:04.760]   that you do at least once or twice a week."
[00:22:04.760 --> 00:22:05.680]   Great, within 10 minutes,
[00:22:05.680 --> 00:22:08.120]   I've now automated that process for you.
[00:22:08.120 --> 00:22:10.280]   It's one of the most brilliant things
[00:22:10.280 --> 00:22:11.440]   that's inside the Mac OS.
[00:22:11.440 --> 00:22:13.200]   And it's something that almost nobody,
[00:22:13.200 --> 00:22:15.600]   no real civilian really uses.
[00:22:15.600 --> 00:22:16.800]   I think that points to,
[00:22:16.800 --> 00:22:20.520]   you can make an automation process as easy as pie for somebody,
[00:22:20.520 --> 00:22:22.680]   but they're still within the,
[00:22:22.680 --> 00:22:24.040]   gonna be the mindset of,
[00:22:24.040 --> 00:22:26.320]   "I will just do A, B and C myself
[00:22:26.320 --> 00:22:29.400]   because programming my computer to do it
[00:22:29.400 --> 00:22:30.320]   is gonna be too complicated."
[00:22:30.320 --> 00:22:31.160]   That's totally true.
[00:22:31.160 --> 00:22:33.000]   We did a, Joe Kistel wrote a book for us,
[00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:34.880]   Take Control of Automating Your Mac.
[00:22:34.880 --> 00:22:37.320]   And if you don't think about it,
[00:22:37.320 --> 00:22:38.440]   like, "Oh, you have to program.
[00:22:38.440 --> 00:22:40.040]   You're automating things."
[00:22:40.040 --> 00:22:43.280]   There are so many ways you can automate things.
[00:22:43.280 --> 00:22:46.600]   And it's been fascinating seeing people go,
[00:22:46.600 --> 00:22:48.560]   "Oh, yeah, I could use keyboard mice, Joe.
[00:22:48.560 --> 00:22:49.480]   I could use Hazel.
[00:22:49.480 --> 00:22:50.520]   I could use Automator.
[00:22:50.520 --> 00:22:51.960]   I could use TextExpander."
[00:22:51.960 --> 00:22:55.760]   It's all doing more things with one action.
[00:22:55.760 --> 00:22:58.240]   And just getting people into that mindset,
[00:22:58.240 --> 00:23:00.120]   so that book has a whole big chapter
[00:23:00.120 --> 00:23:02.000]   and getting into the mindset.
[00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:03.480]   'Cause you really have to do that.
[00:23:03.480 --> 00:23:05.640]   You have to get past that sense of,
[00:23:05.640 --> 00:23:07.040]   "Oh, it's really easy.
[00:23:07.040 --> 00:23:08.640]   I just do X, Y and Z."
[00:23:08.640 --> 00:23:10.560]   Well, what if you just had to do X?
[00:23:10.560 --> 00:23:11.400]   Yeah.
[00:23:11.400 --> 00:23:13.080]   And then all this Y and Z automatically happened.
[00:23:13.080 --> 00:23:14.440]   You gotta get people to realize that.
[00:23:14.440 --> 00:23:16.800]   - A couple of disabled people in the Charon Battle Cam
[00:23:16.800 --> 00:23:18.200]   web 4,000 who point out,
[00:23:18.200 --> 00:23:19.120]   this is great for them.
[00:23:19.120 --> 00:23:20.640]   And I certainly agree,
[00:23:20.640 --> 00:23:22.440]   if it's hard to move, get around
[00:23:22.440 --> 00:23:23.840]   being able to do this automatically.
[00:23:23.840 --> 00:23:25.040]   But you know, this has been around for one.
[00:23:25.040 --> 00:23:26.880]   I'm really excited to hear that the clapper
[00:23:26.880 --> 00:23:30.320]   has now added home kits compatibility.
[00:23:30.320 --> 00:23:34.080]   ♪ Clap on, clap off, clapper ♪
[00:23:34.080 --> 00:23:36.800]   ♪ Let your turn things on or off from anywhere in the room ♪
[00:23:36.800 --> 00:23:37.800]   - Siri, clap on.
[00:23:37.800 --> 00:23:38.800]   - Siri, clap on.
[00:23:38.800 --> 00:23:39.640]   - Oh my God.
[00:23:39.640 --> 00:23:42.080]   - I suddenly have an idea for a brilliant,
[00:23:42.080 --> 00:23:44.600]   like Arduino or Raspberry Pi project.
[00:23:44.600 --> 00:23:47.880]   One servo and like one pair of like casket discipline.
[00:23:47.880 --> 00:23:48.720]   - That's what I need.
[00:23:48.720 --> 00:23:49.720]   I need a pair of X and X.
[00:23:49.720 --> 00:23:53.320]   - Now you control anything that's controllable by the clapper.
[00:23:53.320 --> 00:23:54.160]   - America made it.
[00:23:54.160 --> 00:23:56.160]   - Yes, you can just simply have a speaker make this sound,
[00:23:56.160 --> 00:23:58.040]   but that's not as fun as just two giant.
[00:23:58.040 --> 00:24:01.600]   And we put giant three fingered cartoon gloves on them.
[00:24:01.600 --> 00:24:02.840]   - Why things, why things?
[00:24:02.840 --> 00:24:04.040]   Well, who's done, I think why things
[00:24:04.040 --> 00:24:06.320]   has done some really great Wi-Fi enabled things
[00:24:06.320 --> 00:24:09.360]   like scales, baby monitors, heart rate monitors.
[00:24:09.360 --> 00:24:10.680]   I'm sorry, blood pressure monitors.
[00:24:10.680 --> 00:24:12.960]   They have a Wi things and a new, by the way,
[00:24:12.960 --> 00:24:14.760]   the new watch looks great.
[00:24:14.760 --> 00:24:15.680]   I'm very interested in that.
[00:24:15.680 --> 00:24:18.040]   It's kind of a mechanical watch with smartwatch features.
[00:24:18.040 --> 00:24:20.480]   This is a home camera, IP based,
[00:24:20.480 --> 00:24:23.840]   but it also has environmental senators.
[00:24:23.840 --> 00:24:27.200]   So it can tell you when the air in the house is bad.
[00:24:27.200 --> 00:24:32.280]   That's interesting to text motion to velvet wire.
[00:24:32.280 --> 00:24:33.120]   I'm not familiar with them,
[00:24:33.120 --> 00:24:36.480]   but apparently they make an interesting iPhone charger.
[00:24:36.480 --> 00:24:39.920]   They now have the next generation power slayer blue.
[00:24:39.920 --> 00:24:43.360]   That's oddly enough my work craft handle.
[00:24:43.360 --> 00:24:46.000]   This has Bluetooth and an app so you can get a notification
[00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:49.200]   on your phone when your iPad is done charging.
[00:24:49.200 --> 00:24:50.440]   I'm done.
[00:24:50.440 --> 00:24:51.280]   - Or you.
[00:24:51.280 --> 00:24:53.320]   - I got to throw a flag on this play.
[00:24:53.320 --> 00:24:56.000]   You don't get to call something the power slayer
[00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:58.400]   and color it in cheerful iMac color.
[00:24:58.400 --> 00:25:00.600]   That's a nice messaging.
[00:25:00.600 --> 00:25:04.400]   - That looks like a cyan cable with a nice red something.
[00:25:04.400 --> 00:25:06.640]   I don't know what that is.
[00:25:06.640 --> 00:25:10.120]   And so anyway, it's a smart charger.
[00:25:10.120 --> 00:25:11.600]   Thanks to Susie Oakes at Tech High
[00:25:11.600 --> 00:25:13.320]   for writing this and saving me.
[00:25:13.320 --> 00:25:15.560]   This is why I didn't have to go to CES.
[00:25:15.560 --> 00:25:18.520]   Chamberlain, this is a garage door opener.
[00:25:18.520 --> 00:25:19.920]   In fact, there were believe it or not
[00:25:19.920 --> 00:25:21.600]   some home kit garage door openers.
[00:25:21.600 --> 00:25:25.800]   This is the micro $130 micro garage kit.
[00:25:25.800 --> 00:25:30.800]   Can app open the, you need a wifi hub and a door sensor.
[00:25:30.800 --> 00:25:37.640]   And then you can see if your garage door is open from anywhere.
[00:25:37.640 --> 00:25:39.400]   - Or you could just push the button, I'm sorry.
[00:25:39.400 --> 00:25:42.080]   - Yeah, just push the button on your garage.
[00:25:42.080 --> 00:25:45.440]   Instion, this is Microsoft's been pushing this one.
[00:25:45.440 --> 00:25:47.040]   This is a hub that will be home kit.
[00:25:47.040 --> 00:25:49.520]   I'm sure all the hubs, I'm sure smart things as well.
[00:25:49.520 --> 00:25:50.640]   In fact, I think Samsung announced
[00:25:50.640 --> 00:25:51.720]   that smart things will be as well.
[00:25:51.720 --> 00:25:56.240]   This is, if you've got a hub home kits, another, another,
[00:25:56.240 --> 00:25:59.920]   there's the Incipio, the smart outlet,
[00:25:59.920 --> 00:26:03.360]   the smart lamp adapter and the power strip.
[00:26:03.360 --> 00:26:07.200]   And one more, one more.
[00:26:07.200 --> 00:26:09.880]   The Honeywell Lyric, this is kind of
[00:26:09.880 --> 00:26:11.200]   to compete with Nest, right?
[00:26:11.200 --> 00:26:14.560]   But Nest is also gonna be home kit, right?
[00:26:14.560 --> 00:26:16.640]   - I don't know if it's not. - Maybe not.
[00:26:16.640 --> 00:26:17.920]   - It's not, it's Google, right?
[00:26:17.920 --> 00:26:19.160]   Maybe they don't care.
[00:26:19.160 --> 00:26:21.360]   - Well, a lot of people, a lot of the bigger companies
[00:26:21.360 --> 00:26:22.960]   say that they have their own ecosystem
[00:26:22.960 --> 00:26:25.320]   and that's their priority and they wanna be the several hub
[00:26:25.320 --> 00:26:27.280]   and it'll probably take a while to shake that out.
[00:26:27.280 --> 00:26:30.600]   - This thing uses an app, will use your Apple Watch.
[00:26:30.600 --> 00:26:32.280]   So you can get a real time snapshot
[00:26:32.280 --> 00:26:34.320]   of your home system with glances
[00:26:34.320 --> 00:26:36.600]   and the watch's geofencing feature will let you engage
[00:26:36.600 --> 00:26:38.800]   out of town mode with one tap
[00:26:38.800 --> 00:26:40.960]   when the watch leaves the range of your home network.
[00:26:40.960 --> 00:26:44.000]   Or if somebody steals your watch, it gets really cold at home.
[00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:45.440]   (laughing)
[00:26:45.440 --> 00:26:47.320]   - I'm freezing, does somebody steal my Apple Watch?
[00:26:47.320 --> 00:26:49.160]   - The Lyric thermostat is available now
[00:26:49.160 --> 00:26:52.120]   and the Apple Watch when it comes out.
[00:26:52.120 --> 00:26:52.960]   (laughing)
[00:26:52.960 --> 00:26:54.920]   - We'll be compatible with something that doesn't yet exist.
[00:26:54.920 --> 00:26:56.440]   (laughing)
[00:26:56.440 --> 00:26:59.000]   - That really could be something that helps sell
[00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:01.480]   the Apple Watch, again, the ability to say here is,
[00:27:01.480 --> 00:27:03.840]   no, I'm sorry, here is a specific user,
[00:27:03.840 --> 00:27:07.280]   he is here right now because a lot of the things
[00:27:07.280 --> 00:27:10.960]   that I've really enjoyed about latest Android updates
[00:27:10.960 --> 00:27:14.720]   is the ability to set up geofences that are related
[00:27:14.720 --> 00:27:16.280]   to my physical presence and
[00:27:17.120 --> 00:27:22.120]   getting someone to spend $350 on a category of hardware
[00:27:22.120 --> 00:27:24.480]   that they don't even think they need.
[00:27:24.480 --> 00:27:27.280]   It's not gonna be a $1, $350 reason,
[00:27:27.280 --> 00:27:29.360]   but I think that people can come up with 30 or 40,
[00:27:29.360 --> 00:27:32.040]   $30 reasons to justify the purchases.
[00:27:32.040 --> 00:27:36.000]   - I was speculating, it's just me,
[00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:38.840]   that a new Apple TV would be released as a hub
[00:27:38.840 --> 00:27:39.680]   for HomeKit.
[00:27:39.680 --> 00:27:40.960]   The Verge says,
[00:27:40.960 --> 00:27:42.120]   - The current one works like that,
[00:27:42.120 --> 00:27:44.600]   if as long as you have the latest release of the Apple TV,
[00:27:44.600 --> 00:27:46.440]   it'll work as a HomeKit hub.
[00:27:46.440 --> 00:27:47.280]   - Ah.
[00:27:47.280 --> 00:27:49.640]   - So the one that they released a couple of years ago, yeah.
[00:27:49.640 --> 00:27:50.840]   - Okay.
[00:27:50.840 --> 00:27:52.880]   - It still seems that the Apple TV 3
[00:27:52.880 --> 00:27:54.560]   is getting a little old in the tooth,
[00:27:54.560 --> 00:27:55.400]   but,
[00:27:55.400 --> 00:27:56.720]   - One of the teeth.
[00:27:56.720 --> 00:27:58.160]   - Third generation or a little app or TV
[00:27:58.160 --> 00:27:59.320]   is running software 7.
[00:27:59.320 --> 00:28:01.000]   - It's because though it still has any teeth left
[00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:01.840]   in its mouth.
[00:28:01.840 --> 00:28:03.160]   (laughing)
[00:28:03.160 --> 00:28:04.240]   - I think it's gummy, it's food.
[00:28:04.240 --> 00:28:05.720]   - It's gummy, exactly.
[00:28:05.720 --> 00:28:07.560]   So what can I do with the Apple TV?
[00:28:07.560 --> 00:28:08.960]   How do I,
[00:28:08.960 --> 00:28:11.680]   it's remote stuff, so let's say you're in Europe
[00:28:11.680 --> 00:28:12.920]   and you suddenly realize,
[00:28:12.920 --> 00:28:14.080]   you know, you wanna do something at home,
[00:28:14.080 --> 00:28:15.240]   you can say Siri, I, you know,
[00:28:15.240 --> 00:28:16.240]   Siri turn on my lights
[00:28:16.240 --> 00:28:17.640]   so people don't think that I'm on vacation.
[00:28:17.640 --> 00:28:19.040]   - Siri, Siri, I'm at the airport
[00:28:19.040 --> 00:28:20.560]   and I forgot my passport.
[00:28:20.560 --> 00:28:22.920]   - Yeah, Siri, I love the stove on.
[00:28:22.920 --> 00:28:25.520]   - I hate gossip, girl, but I wanna binge watch it anyway.
[00:28:25.520 --> 00:28:26.880]   Could you just binge watch it for me
[00:28:26.880 --> 00:28:28.160]   while I'm safely out of the house?
[00:28:28.160 --> 00:28:29.000]   - Yeah.
[00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:31.000]   - No, Andy, I'm afraid we can't do that, Andy.
[00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:34.080]   - Does MFI made for iPhone iPad?
[00:28:34.080 --> 00:28:36.080]   Does that include HomeKit now,
[00:28:36.080 --> 00:28:37.720]   or is it gonna be an MFI or,
[00:28:37.720 --> 00:28:42.080]   is there a certification program for HomeKit compatibility?
[00:28:42.080 --> 00:28:44.040]   - Yes, but I don't know if it's a called MFI.
[00:28:44.040 --> 00:28:45.080]   I don't think it's a, yeah,
[00:28:45.080 --> 00:28:46.600]   I'm trying to figure out why that would come
[00:28:46.600 --> 00:28:47.760]   under that spec.
[00:28:47.760 --> 00:28:49.720]   - They have been mentioning MFI, right?
[00:28:49.720 --> 00:28:52.960]   - Well, 'cause a lot of them, they run on the iPhone too,
[00:28:52.960 --> 00:28:55.320]   so maybe there's some component.
[00:28:55.320 --> 00:28:56.160]   - Right. - iPhone part.
[00:28:56.160 --> 00:28:57.520]   - Oh yeah, of course.
[00:28:57.520 --> 00:29:00.440]   According to the Verge, the licensing program
[00:29:00.440 --> 00:29:02.000]   for HomeKit is just getting started,
[00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:05.840]   so nothing that you saw at CES is Apple approved.
[00:29:05.840 --> 00:29:08.040]   So people are saying we're gonna be HomeKit
[00:29:08.040 --> 00:29:09.880]   'cause we've got the SDK,
[00:29:09.880 --> 00:29:11.560]   but Apple says yet to give,
[00:29:11.560 --> 00:29:13.520]   to have a certification program for that.
[00:29:14.200 --> 00:29:15.240]   - That does feel like good news.
[00:29:15.240 --> 00:29:16.320]   If they're building stuff
[00:29:16.320 --> 00:29:18.200]   and then simply making it compatible later on,
[00:29:18.200 --> 00:29:19.640]   as opposed to we're building something
[00:29:19.640 --> 00:29:21.840]   specifically to take advantage of HomeKit,
[00:29:21.840 --> 00:29:23.800]   that's the sort of stuff that will change
[00:29:23.800 --> 00:29:25.240]   in a tire market as opposed to,
[00:29:25.240 --> 00:29:26.560]   we're gonna make an iPhone accessory.
[00:29:26.560 --> 00:29:27.840]   No, we're gonna make a Home accessory,
[00:29:27.840 --> 00:29:29.080]   and if you have an iPhone, that's great,
[00:29:29.080 --> 00:29:30.760]   but we don't necessarily need you to do that.
[00:29:30.760 --> 00:29:32.640]   - Well, and that's been the problem with Home Automation
[00:29:32.640 --> 00:29:33.480]   all along.
[00:29:33.480 --> 00:29:35.800]   You've got Z-Wave and ZigVx and X and 10 and--
[00:29:35.800 --> 00:29:36.640]   - Pifdoms.
[00:29:36.640 --> 00:29:38.040]   - Yeah, and you don't need another one.
[00:29:38.040 --> 00:29:39.600]   What you need is something that will do,
[00:29:39.600 --> 00:29:42.000]   that is gonna play nice.
[00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:43.440]   - Right now, I take my iPhone out,
[00:29:43.440 --> 00:29:44.600]   I open the Home folder, I go,
[00:29:44.600 --> 00:29:46.480]   I tap the Hue app, I adjust the Hue lights,
[00:29:46.480 --> 00:29:48.320]   I leave that app, I bring the Sonos app up,
[00:29:48.320 --> 00:29:49.160]   I turn the sound.
[00:29:49.160 --> 00:29:50.000]   - Right.
[00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:51.800]   It'd be nice to combine all that, I agree.
[00:29:51.800 --> 00:29:52.960]   - It's so much work, Leo.
[00:29:52.960 --> 00:29:53.800]   - Yeah.
[00:29:53.800 --> 00:29:54.640]   - You're a single guy,
[00:29:54.640 --> 00:29:56.720]   do you have a round rotating bed as well?
[00:29:56.720 --> 00:29:57.880]   I mean, is that help?
[00:29:57.880 --> 00:29:58.720]   - No, is that the thing?
[00:29:58.720 --> 00:29:59.560]   Am I supposed to fix that?
[00:29:59.560 --> 00:30:01.640]   - I think you said, okay, so I'm just thinking,
[00:30:01.640 --> 00:30:04.640]   the drapes draw, the bed starts to rotate.
[00:30:04.640 --> 00:30:06.120]   - The automated drapes were cool at CES,
[00:30:06.120 --> 00:30:07.600]   a lot of people had those.
[00:30:07.600 --> 00:30:08.760]   - Yeah, we need Barry White.
[00:30:08.760 --> 00:30:10.520]   - Do you know, like, when you have
[00:30:10.520 --> 00:30:12.880]   any idea how much torque a motor needs
[00:30:12.880 --> 00:30:15.200]   to rotate around water bed?
[00:30:15.200 --> 00:30:16.600]   Come on, Leo.
[00:30:16.600 --> 00:30:18.760]   It's gonna sound like you got a drone in the bedroom.
[00:30:18.760 --> 00:30:21.160]   (laughing)
[00:30:21.160 --> 00:30:22.760]   - It's so unusual.
[00:30:22.760 --> 00:30:24.600]   (imitating a drone)
[00:30:24.600 --> 00:30:25.520]   - One of the more poppin' things,
[00:30:25.520 --> 00:30:27.480]   they had drones that were on your watch
[00:30:27.480 --> 00:30:28.600]   and they would take off from your watch,
[00:30:28.600 --> 00:30:30.520]   fly around and then come back to your watch.
[00:30:30.520 --> 00:30:32.120]   - Wait a minute, what, you mean, right,
[00:30:32.120 --> 00:30:33.200]   on my wristwatch?
[00:30:33.200 --> 00:30:34.040]   - Yeah.
[00:30:34.040 --> 00:30:34.880]   - Little mini drone?
[00:30:34.880 --> 00:30:36.200]   - Yep.
[00:30:36.200 --> 00:30:38.200]   - Like, you know those little birds,
[00:30:38.200 --> 00:30:40.200]   that like, like, play the crocken.
[00:30:40.200 --> 00:30:41.040]   - It was like a 75.
[00:30:41.040 --> 00:30:41.880]   - Like, a 75 pomptomises ears.
[00:30:41.880 --> 00:30:42.960]   So now you can actually, without, you know,
[00:30:42.960 --> 00:30:44.560]   no Q-tips necessary, you'll watch them.
[00:30:44.560 --> 00:30:45.960]   - Yeah, like, micro drone, it'll just go.
[00:30:45.960 --> 00:30:48.120]   - This is a dic-dic drone.
[00:30:48.120 --> 00:30:50.760]   - My joke for CES was that they were 3D printing drones
[00:30:50.760 --> 00:30:53.400]   that would take 4K video that would play on your dishwasher.
[00:30:53.400 --> 00:30:55.600]   That was like CES summed up according to my experience.
[00:30:55.600 --> 00:30:58.080]   (laughing)
[00:30:58.080 --> 00:30:59.400]   - Oh, Lord.
[00:30:59.400 --> 00:31:00.800]   - That sound disruptive though.
[00:31:00.800 --> 00:31:02.280]   (laughing)
[00:31:02.280 --> 00:31:04.560]   - Well, it's a really cool health kit stuff too.
[00:31:04.560 --> 00:31:07.080]   Like, Atmos has these shorts and shirts,
[00:31:07.080 --> 00:31:08.080]   they have for men and for women,
[00:31:08.080 --> 00:31:09.680]   and you put a little module in it,
[00:31:09.680 --> 00:31:12.000]   and then it reads, like, what happens with your muscle.
[00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:13.800]   So how much you're tensing your muscle,
[00:31:13.800 --> 00:31:15.520]   whether your muscles are in balance or not,
[00:31:15.520 --> 00:31:17.200]   and you can have like a personal trainer watch while
[00:31:17.200 --> 00:31:19.200]   you're doing it, or you can review it afterwards
[00:31:19.200 --> 00:31:21.800]   and sort of see, like, your favoring your left side.
[00:31:21.800 --> 00:31:23.760]   You might have, it's really good for physiotherapy
[00:31:23.760 --> 00:31:26.520]   or people who are trying to do the prevention.
[00:31:26.520 --> 00:31:28.040]   - I'm so trying not to go with this one.
[00:31:28.040 --> 00:31:30.240]   I mean, instead of module in your shorts
[00:31:30.240 --> 00:31:31.560]   or are you just happy to see me?
[00:31:31.560 --> 00:31:32.680]   I mean, just, yeah.
[00:31:32.680 --> 00:31:34.520]   - You can put it in your shirt too.
[00:31:34.520 --> 00:31:36.000]   (laughing)
[00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:36.840]   - I like that.
[00:31:36.840 --> 00:31:38.720]   Actually, you know, one of the nicest things
[00:31:38.720 --> 00:31:40.560]   about the Connect on Xbox One
[00:31:40.560 --> 00:31:42.680]   is it can somehow tell your heart rate,
[00:31:42.680 --> 00:31:45.440]   like, as you're turning red, as you're exercising.
[00:31:45.440 --> 00:31:46.720]   And if you're not exercising hard enough,
[00:31:46.720 --> 00:31:48.280]   it'll actually say, you know, 'cause step it up,
[00:31:48.280 --> 00:31:49.480]   or if you're doing too much,
[00:31:49.480 --> 00:31:50.960]   it'll say slow down, big boy.
[00:31:50.960 --> 00:31:53.040]   So that's kind of cool.
[00:31:53.040 --> 00:31:55.200]   No one uses this, by the way.
[00:31:55.200 --> 00:31:57.360]   But I think that's kind of cool.
[00:31:57.360 --> 00:31:58.760]   Atmos, huh?
[00:31:58.760 --> 00:32:00.080]   - Yeah, well, it's cool because, again,
[00:32:00.080 --> 00:32:01.840]   like for someone doing physiotherapy,
[00:32:01.840 --> 00:32:02.680]   you know, it's the same, like,
[00:32:02.680 --> 00:32:05.160]   your tires can go bald because your axle is misaligned,
[00:32:05.160 --> 00:32:07.120]   and that's really hard for a lot of physiotherapists
[00:32:07.120 --> 00:32:08.320]   to diagnose, but if they can see
[00:32:08.320 --> 00:32:10.800]   that there's a muscle weakness or a muscle overload,
[00:32:10.800 --> 00:32:12.080]   then they can give you exercises
[00:32:12.080 --> 00:32:13.640]   that will help you walk again,
[00:32:13.640 --> 00:32:14.720]   or do all sorts of awesome things.
[00:32:14.720 --> 00:32:16.200]   - This is a category we've been talking about
[00:32:16.200 --> 00:32:18.880]   for a long time, the idea of smart clothing.
[00:32:18.880 --> 00:32:19.720]   - Yeah.
[00:32:19.720 --> 00:32:20.560]   - Me.
[00:32:20.560 --> 00:32:22.520]   - It does point to how,
[00:32:22.520 --> 00:32:24.920]   one of the greatest things that Apple's working on,
[00:32:24.920 --> 00:32:26.480]   the things that really get me excited,
[00:32:26.480 --> 00:32:27.840]   aren't a specific technology,
[00:32:27.840 --> 00:32:30.080]   but how well all these pieces can fit together.
[00:32:30.080 --> 00:32:31.760]   'Cause here we're talking about home sensors,
[00:32:31.760 --> 00:32:34.600]   about a wearable device that knows where you are.
[00:32:34.600 --> 00:32:38.080]   But imagine just if you have someone who has a health problem
[00:32:38.080 --> 00:32:41.960]   or a result early, just the ability to have home kit,
[00:32:41.960 --> 00:32:43.600]   talk to health kit and say,
[00:32:43.600 --> 00:32:47.560]   "Okay, you have not, you have only been in the bedroom
[00:32:47.560 --> 00:32:49.240]   and the bathroom adjoining the bedroom
[00:32:49.240 --> 00:32:50.920]   for the past three days.
[00:32:50.920 --> 00:32:52.440]   Do you acting on your instructions?
[00:32:52.440 --> 00:32:54.640]   I'm going to let your son and daughter know
[00:32:54.640 --> 00:32:57.880]   that you haven't been leaving the house for the past week."
[00:32:57.880 --> 00:32:58.880]   And it's great.
[00:32:58.880 --> 00:32:59.720]   - So this is great.
[00:32:59.720 --> 00:33:00.560]   - It's great.
[00:33:00.560 --> 00:33:02.480]   - It's data like that that really is useful for something.
[00:33:02.480 --> 00:33:04.240]   - Yeah, grandma's, grandma has motion
[00:33:04.240 --> 00:33:05.840]   to be protecting pants.
[00:33:05.840 --> 00:33:06.680]   (laughing)
[00:33:06.680 --> 00:33:07.520]   - Follow me.
[00:33:07.520 --> 00:33:08.840]   (laughing)
[00:33:08.840 --> 00:33:10.680]   - Well, something is so good.
[00:33:10.680 --> 00:33:12.680]   (laughing)
[00:33:12.680 --> 00:33:13.720]   - You think I'm making that up?
[00:33:13.720 --> 00:33:15.400]   - I'm so ripe for abuse.
[00:33:15.400 --> 00:33:17.040]   Oh boy.
[00:33:17.040 --> 00:33:20.520]   You want to make sure you want two factor authentication
[00:33:20.520 --> 00:33:22.160]   on that device because,
[00:33:22.160 --> 00:33:24.640]   yeah, he don't want people making great sport
[00:33:24.640 --> 00:33:27.000]   of the data they're taking out of your underwear.
[00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:29.080]   - People with wearables are not to you.
[00:33:29.080 --> 00:33:30.480]   - Yeah.
[00:33:30.480 --> 00:33:33.640]   - Well, I don't know what he's liking about the Lego movie,
[00:33:33.640 --> 00:33:35.720]   but I'm definitely going to one hour and one time
[00:33:35.720 --> 00:33:38.560]   is see what he's enjoying so much about the Lego movie.
[00:33:38.560 --> 00:33:42.920]   - We did kind of, I mean, this is what the Nike stuff was
[00:33:42.920 --> 00:33:43.800]   with the iPod, right?
[00:33:43.800 --> 00:33:45.240]   I mean, in a way, that's what that is.
[00:33:45.240 --> 00:33:47.560]   You put a sensor in your shoe.
[00:33:47.560 --> 00:33:50.600]   Makes sense to extend those sensors to T-shirts and other.
[00:33:50.600 --> 00:33:52.000]   - And to make wearables just wearable,
[00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:53.760]   not just watches, you know, or not just bands,
[00:33:53.760 --> 00:33:55.680]   but actually do other just things with them.
[00:33:55.680 --> 00:33:57.920]   - It makes, I presume makes article clothing
[00:33:57.920 --> 00:34:00.120]   very expensive, hard to wash.
[00:34:00.120 --> 00:34:02.400]   - It's $100 for each article of clothing
[00:34:02.400 --> 00:34:04.080]   and it's typical sports where it's the kind of stuff
[00:34:04.080 --> 00:34:06.520]   that you would get at, you know, Lulu Lemon or something.
[00:34:06.520 --> 00:34:09.960]   And then the module, I think, is $150 or $200,
[00:34:09.960 --> 00:34:12.280]   but you can take it out of one and put it in the other.
[00:34:12.280 --> 00:34:15.280]   So you can use it in multiple articles if you want to.
[00:34:15.280 --> 00:34:16.440]   - I'll be curious to give that a try.
[00:34:16.440 --> 00:34:19.000]   I actually participated in a research study.
[00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:22.560]   SUNY Binghamton professor, a couple years ago,
[00:34:22.560 --> 00:34:24.560]   actually a number of years ago, this point was working
[00:34:24.560 --> 00:34:26.240]   with local runners and, you know,
[00:34:26.240 --> 00:34:28.760]   using attaching sensors to our legs
[00:34:28.760 --> 00:34:30.880]   and, you know, in having us run and seeing
[00:34:30.880 --> 00:34:33.480]   what he could, seeing what information he could read
[00:34:33.480 --> 00:34:36.800]   about the muscular contractions in different parts
[00:34:36.800 --> 00:34:38.720]   of the leg and different parts of the body.
[00:34:38.720 --> 00:34:41.640]   And, but it was really finicky to get the stuff on
[00:34:41.640 --> 00:34:43.200]   and get it reading and all that.
[00:34:43.200 --> 00:34:47.240]   So I'll be curious to see how well the clothing actually
[00:34:47.240 --> 00:34:49.520]   performs.
[00:34:49.520 --> 00:34:52.040]   - I had David Pogue on triangulation yesterday.
[00:34:52.040 --> 00:34:53.080]   It was great to see David again.
[00:34:53.080 --> 00:34:56.560]   He'd been on Macbreak many times, years ago.
[00:34:56.560 --> 00:34:59.040]   And he actually had a great insight that I,
[00:34:59.040 --> 00:35:00.920]   a kind of a light went on for me.
[00:35:00.920 --> 00:35:02.920]   I was asking why drones were so popular.
[00:35:02.920 --> 00:35:05.120]   He said, because we're ants on a tablecloth.
[00:35:05.120 --> 00:35:08.200]   We don't, we live in essentially 2D world.
[00:35:08.200 --> 00:35:12.080]   And it's really thrilling to suddenly expand out into 3D
[00:35:12.080 --> 00:35:13.040]   and see ourselves.
[00:35:13.040 --> 00:35:16.080]   And he said, that's similar to this wearable stuff
[00:35:16.080 --> 00:35:19.240]   because we're, and we're learning about parts of ourselves
[00:35:19.240 --> 00:35:21.080]   that we don't normally know about.
[00:35:21.080 --> 00:35:23.240]   We're logging our sleep or our heart rate,
[00:35:23.240 --> 00:35:25.480]   our muscular activity.
[00:35:25.480 --> 00:35:27.040]   And it's, it's the same kind of thing.
[00:35:27.040 --> 00:35:31.400]   It's this new view into what has been up to now
[00:35:31.400 --> 00:35:33.520]   a fairly limited view of ourselves.
[00:35:33.520 --> 00:35:34.520]   And I think this is true.
[00:35:34.520 --> 00:35:38.280]   - It's, it's ethos active where ATHO-S not at.
[00:35:38.280 --> 00:35:42.680]   - Athos like, the three musketeers.
[00:35:42.680 --> 00:35:44.080]   - Yeah, Athos active where.
[00:35:44.080 --> 00:35:46.840]   - I really think that a watch is going to be a lot more
[00:35:46.840 --> 00:35:48.640]   important for fitness and stuff like that.
[00:35:48.640 --> 00:35:50.240]   Because you have to, you have to make the decision
[00:35:50.240 --> 00:35:52.160]   that you want to have this tracking device,
[00:35:52.160 --> 00:35:55.520]   that you want to have clothing that takes advantage of it.
[00:35:55.520 --> 00:35:59.080]   A Nike fit was, was, was, was really useful,
[00:35:59.080 --> 00:36:01.200]   but you have to buy the special shoes.
[00:36:01.200 --> 00:36:02.760]   If you just buying a watch,
[00:36:02.760 --> 00:36:04.280]   'cause it's cool and you like it,
[00:36:04.280 --> 00:36:06.880]   but it also happens to have these fitness features in it.
[00:36:06.880 --> 00:36:10.480]   I, I, I, I am now using a step counter.
[00:36:10.480 --> 00:36:12.280]   I'm now more aware of how many steps I'm taking
[00:36:12.280 --> 00:36:14.640]   every single day because that happened to be a feature
[00:36:14.640 --> 00:36:16.440]   of this watch that I happen to like.
[00:36:16.440 --> 00:36:18.000]   So it's when these things become ubiquitous,
[00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:20.080]   when you have them accessible to you,
[00:36:20.080 --> 00:36:22.120]   whether you make the choice to have them or not.
[00:36:22.120 --> 00:36:25.040]   And you can choose to see that data or not.
[00:36:25.040 --> 00:36:26.920]   That's when people really will get the benefits
[00:36:26.920 --> 00:36:28.320]   of the, of these health apps.
[00:36:28.320 --> 00:36:30.840]   This is a smart, this Athos stuff is a smart market
[00:36:30.840 --> 00:36:32.840]   because there are performance athletes,
[00:36:32.840 --> 00:36:37.440]   serious like hardcore athletes who do want this information
[00:36:37.440 --> 00:36:38.640]   and willing to spend money for it.
[00:36:38.640 --> 00:36:40.720]   That's why Polar has been so successful
[00:36:40.720 --> 00:36:42.520]   with very simple heart rate monitors.
[00:36:42.520 --> 00:36:44.800]   I think this is a specialized niche market,
[00:36:44.800 --> 00:36:46.480]   but a very good one.
[00:36:46.480 --> 00:36:49.040]   Yeah, I, I run with a Garmin Forerunner 620,
[00:36:49.040 --> 00:36:50.240]   for instance, how much was that?
[00:36:50.240 --> 00:36:51.760]   It was hundreds of dollars.
[00:36:51.760 --> 00:36:54.120]   Oh yeah, it's, it's like 399.
[00:36:54.120 --> 00:36:55.400]   With the, with the heart rate monitor,
[00:36:55.400 --> 00:36:57.640]   but it tells me things like cadence,
[00:36:57.640 --> 00:37:00.280]   ground contact time, vertical oscillation.
[00:37:00.280 --> 00:37:03.280]   So, you know, it's, it, it provides some really interesting data.
[00:37:03.280 --> 00:37:06.040]   I will say that when push comes to shove,
[00:37:06.040 --> 00:37:08.800]   what's most interesting about it is the mere logging
[00:37:08.800 --> 00:37:11.120]   that I don't actually wear the heart rate monitor
[00:37:11.120 --> 00:37:11.960]   all the time.
[00:37:11.960 --> 00:37:14.720]   I don't look at the data because it's a little hard to know
[00:37:14.720 --> 00:37:17.120]   quite how to act on it yet.
[00:37:17.120 --> 00:37:19.080]   That it's more about collecting data
[00:37:19.080 --> 00:37:22.440]   than, than being able to tell you what to do with it.
[00:37:22.440 --> 00:37:25.160]   So, you know, I can, to say that my, you know,
[00:37:25.160 --> 00:37:28.760]   my cadence is, you know, was 180 strides per minute
[00:37:28.760 --> 00:37:31.800]   during a speed workout, but what does that mean?
[00:37:31.800 --> 00:37:33.040]   I was trying to, you know,
[00:37:33.040 --> 00:37:34.200]   was trying to run fast.
[00:37:34.200 --> 00:37:36.000]   Of course it was going to be faster, you know,
[00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:39.160]   so again, hard to, hard to know quite what to do
[00:37:39.160 --> 00:37:40.720]   with that information sometimes,
[00:37:40.720 --> 00:37:42.840]   but I think it's for the first step
[00:37:42.840 --> 00:37:44.360]   is to always get that information.
[00:37:44.360 --> 00:37:45.760]   Then you can decide later on,
[00:37:45.760 --> 00:37:47.080]   or you can have a coach or someone
[00:37:47.080 --> 00:37:49.120]   who knows, evaluate it for you.
[00:37:49.120 --> 00:37:50.200]   Right.
[00:37:50.200 --> 00:37:51.760]   I could totally, I think this is,
[00:37:51.760 --> 00:37:53.120]   I think Athos is probably smart.
[00:37:53.120 --> 00:37:55.720]   This is a market where people spend a lot of money
[00:37:55.720 --> 00:37:56.680]   for this kind of information.
[00:37:56.680 --> 00:37:58.480]   Oh, they want to know if they're squat fired 100%
[00:37:58.480 --> 00:37:59.480]   of their quadricep leo.
[00:37:59.480 --> 00:38:01.200]   Exactly. It's not good enough.
[00:38:01.200 --> 00:38:02.720]   Look at it. It's kind of wild.
[00:38:02.720 --> 00:38:05.760]   I wish it looked, so the ads show like you look like
[00:38:05.760 --> 00:38:08.000]   something that a Tron, but in fact,
[00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:09.360]   you just look normal.
[00:38:09.360 --> 00:38:10.520]   20 Stark 4.0.
[00:38:10.520 --> 00:38:13.200]   I really wish it had all those lines and glowing things.
[00:38:13.200 --> 00:38:14.680]   (laughing)
[00:38:14.680 --> 00:38:16.760]   It would be much better, but yeah,
[00:38:16.760 --> 00:38:19.480]   this might be, this actually might be a smart.
[00:38:19.480 --> 00:38:22.120]   And by the way, it does not chafe.
[00:38:22.120 --> 00:38:22.960]   So that's-
[00:38:22.960 --> 00:38:23.800]   I just like that we're going there,
[00:38:23.800 --> 00:38:24.960]   that we're trying these things a lot of the-
[00:38:24.960 --> 00:38:25.800]   I love the one for chafing.
[00:38:25.800 --> 00:38:26.640]   A lot of them will be silly,
[00:38:26.640 --> 00:38:27.840]   but we'll get somewhere.
[00:38:27.840 --> 00:38:30.200]   Chafing is my favorite part of working out.
[00:38:30.200 --> 00:38:32.760]   Will not chafing is the best.
[00:38:32.760 --> 00:38:33.600]   This is very cool.
[00:38:33.600 --> 00:38:36.480]   So the shirt has 14 EMG sensors,
[00:38:36.480 --> 00:38:38.400]   which measure muscle activity,
[00:38:38.400 --> 00:38:40.760]   two heart rate sensors, two breathing sensors.
[00:38:40.760 --> 00:38:42.160]   I, this is, you know what,
[00:38:42.160 --> 00:38:43.760]   if I were going to invest, I'd invest in this.
[00:38:43.760 --> 00:38:44.720]   This is smart.
[00:38:44.720 --> 00:38:45.560]   This is a market.
[00:38:45.560 --> 00:38:46.480]   Of course, the real problem is you're going to have
[00:38:46.480 --> 00:38:48.240]   to wash the silly thing every day
[00:38:48.240 --> 00:38:50.000]   so you can wear it for the next day's workout.
[00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:50.840]   Well, you need to.
[00:38:50.840 --> 00:38:53.040]   At least you can swap the core in and out, right?
[00:38:53.040 --> 00:38:56.040]   So the most expensive piece can be swapped in and out.
[00:38:56.040 --> 00:38:59.280]   And these, and these, they say it's,
[00:38:59.280 --> 00:39:02.000]   and it looks like kind of like an under armor
[00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:03.720]   or any kind of compression wear.
[00:39:03.720 --> 00:39:05.320]   So it's pretty standard.
[00:39:05.320 --> 00:39:08.000]   Interesting.
[00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:08.840]   It isn't, yeah.
[00:39:08.840 --> 00:39:10.160]   Yeah.
[00:39:10.160 --> 00:39:11.280]   Of course, only Adam Anks,
[00:39:11.280 --> 00:39:13.040]   Twirly is an athlete here, so.
[00:39:13.040 --> 00:39:14.200]   (laughing)
[00:39:14.200 --> 00:39:16.360]   I was about to say it's like,
[00:39:16.360 --> 00:39:19.760]   you have to be at a certain level where that data is good.
[00:39:19.760 --> 00:39:22.080]   You have to be so good at what you're doing right now
[00:39:22.080 --> 00:39:24.640]   that you need information like that to make you better.
[00:39:24.640 --> 00:39:25.600]   For me, it's just like, well,
[00:39:25.600 --> 00:39:29.040]   how about this week you go out and you do your five miles?
[00:39:29.040 --> 00:39:31.520]   I sure would just say, eat a salad, you fat.
[00:39:31.520 --> 00:39:32.520]   No.
[00:39:32.520 --> 00:39:33.360]   All right.
[00:39:33.360 --> 00:39:34.360]   (laughing)
[00:39:34.360 --> 00:39:35.200]   All right.
[00:39:35.200 --> 00:39:37.160]   I know you were thinking, you know where I was going.
[00:39:37.160 --> 00:39:39.520]   (laughing)
[00:39:39.520 --> 00:39:41.680]   Anything else from CES?
[00:39:41.680 --> 00:39:43.840]   New iPad cases and excitement.
[00:39:43.840 --> 00:39:45.680]   There was a lot, there was a lot of cases.
[00:39:45.680 --> 00:39:47.520]   There was some that were, there was a battery case
[00:39:47.520 --> 00:39:50.440]   for 800 bucks that had Manta Ray skin on it.
[00:39:50.440 --> 00:39:51.600]   The thing that was interesting to me
[00:39:51.600 --> 00:39:53.240]   is we got to interview all the new,
[00:39:53.240 --> 00:39:56.320]   they announced 4K HDR Blu-rays at CES.
[00:39:56.320 --> 00:39:58.320]   And for me, the high dynamic range,
[00:39:58.320 --> 00:40:00.320]   the high color gamut stuff is more interesting
[00:40:00.320 --> 00:40:01.760]   than just the 4K.
[00:40:01.760 --> 00:40:03.440]   But I got to interview them one after the other
[00:40:03.440 --> 00:40:05.520]   and one was like, our quantum pixels are the best.
[00:40:05.520 --> 00:40:07.080]   And the one's like, no, those are stupid.
[00:40:07.080 --> 00:40:09.440]   It's the yellow, it's the yellow pixels are the best.
[00:40:09.440 --> 00:40:10.400]   I've done that interview.
[00:40:10.400 --> 00:40:11.240]   Yeah.
[00:40:11.240 --> 00:40:13.280]   No, you're 4K, we're 4K beyond.
[00:40:13.280 --> 00:40:15.200]   And they're just all the arguing about stuff
[00:40:15.200 --> 00:40:16.320]   that there's no content for it.
[00:40:16.320 --> 00:40:18.120]   I thought it was just an amazing encapsulation
[00:40:18.120 --> 00:40:18.960]   of CES in general.
[00:40:18.960 --> 00:40:20.360]   Kate's tax.
[00:40:20.360 --> 00:40:21.360]   Put them in a rank.
[00:40:21.360 --> 00:40:23.240]   Yeah, Kate's match.
[00:40:23.240 --> 00:40:25.640]   It's Sony versus Panasonic in a fight to the film.
[00:40:25.640 --> 00:40:27.320]   Actually, kind of is.
[00:40:27.320 --> 00:40:28.160]   Yeah.
[00:40:28.160 --> 00:40:29.360]   You know, all these companies are struggling.
[00:40:29.360 --> 00:40:32.520]   'Cause Samsung announced SuHD, not just with UHD.
[00:40:32.520 --> 00:40:34.360]   And I asked them, it doesn't stand for Samsung.
[00:40:34.360 --> 00:40:36.560]   S is the letter they put in front of anything
[00:40:36.560 --> 00:40:38.840]   that they think is spectacular beyond the norm.
[00:40:38.840 --> 00:40:40.200]   Beyond the norm.
[00:40:40.200 --> 00:40:44.600]   But they will be the first 4K sets to be standardized
[00:40:44.600 --> 00:40:46.360]   with this new UHD alliance.
[00:40:46.360 --> 00:40:47.920]   So that's-- Which is not 4K.
[00:40:47.920 --> 00:40:50.120]   Like, UHD is actually lower resolution than 4K,
[00:40:50.120 --> 00:40:51.320]   which blows my mind.
[00:40:51.320 --> 00:40:54.440]   Well, it's 'cause the aspect ratio is different, right?
[00:40:54.440 --> 00:40:55.360]   It's--
[00:40:55.360 --> 00:40:56.280]   I don't care.
[00:40:56.280 --> 00:40:57.440]   I know.
[00:40:57.440 --> 00:40:58.640]   It's fake a TV.
[00:40:58.640 --> 00:40:59.600]   You know what Polk said?
[00:40:59.600 --> 00:41:00.440]   I think he's right.
[00:41:00.440 --> 00:41:02.120]   He said, don't rush out to get one.
[00:41:02.120 --> 00:41:04.880]   But just like everything else, every TV will have it
[00:41:04.880 --> 00:41:06.200]   in five years or four years.
[00:41:06.200 --> 00:41:08.880]   And when you get your next TV, it'll have it.
[00:41:08.880 --> 00:41:11.120]   But there's no reason to go out and get a new TV
[00:41:11.120 --> 00:41:12.480]   just for that right now.
[00:41:12.480 --> 00:41:14.560]   Especially if you don't sit three feet from your TV.
[00:41:14.560 --> 00:41:15.720]   Just to watch upscaled--
[00:41:15.720 --> 00:41:16.480]   Yeah.
[00:41:16.480 --> 00:41:18.160]   It'll be watching upscaled content.
[00:41:18.160 --> 00:41:21.120]   There is, as you mentioned, a new UHD Blu-ray
[00:41:21.120 --> 00:41:22.720]   will be out in the fall as well.
[00:41:22.720 --> 00:41:24.000]   But these things will be expensive.
[00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:25.440]   It'll be an early adopter.
[00:41:25.440 --> 00:41:27.120]   It'll get on me or somebody with a home theater.
[00:41:27.120 --> 00:41:27.920]   And the rest of us--
[00:41:27.920 --> 00:41:28.920]   Well, it's like 3D.
[00:41:28.920 --> 00:41:30.120]   It'll just come with the TV.
[00:41:30.120 --> 00:41:32.680]   And then it won't, because no one wants it.
[00:41:32.680 --> 00:41:34.760]   I asked the sharp guys about all these displays.
[00:41:34.760 --> 00:41:36.720]   Like the 4K displays and things.
[00:41:36.720 --> 00:41:37.560]   And how high can you go?
[00:41:37.560 --> 00:41:38.560]   And he said he stopped counting.
[00:41:38.560 --> 00:41:41.240]   He said we can do like 600, 900 DPI now.
[00:41:41.240 --> 00:41:41.880]   Oh, they're--
[00:41:41.880 --> 00:41:44.360]   They're showing 8K and 16K.
[00:41:44.360 --> 00:41:46.040]   Yeah, I was talking about smartphones too,
[00:41:46.040 --> 00:41:48.480]   because now we have like 400 DPI and 600 DPI.
[00:41:48.480 --> 00:41:49.520]   And you just said you don't forget about it.
[00:41:49.520 --> 00:41:51.400]   We'll make those displays so dense.
[00:41:51.400 --> 00:41:53.000]   You'll need math skills to solve that stuff.
[00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:55.000]   Yeah.
[00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:56.200]   We're going math things.
[00:41:56.200 --> 00:41:57.200]   Just look at the screen.
[00:41:57.200 --> 00:41:58.640]   We're going too far at this point.
[00:41:58.640 --> 00:41:59.920]   Yes.
[00:41:59.920 --> 00:42:00.440]   Anything else.
[00:42:00.440 --> 00:42:03.600]   I just want to make sure we've covered the Apple angle on CES
[00:42:03.600 --> 00:42:05.720]   in its entirety before we move on.
[00:42:05.720 --> 00:42:09.160]   So home kit, health kit, car play.
[00:42:09.160 --> 00:42:10.000]   Those are the big things.
[00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:12.200]   Those are the things we looked at.
[00:42:12.200 --> 00:42:12.680]   Lightning.
[00:42:12.680 --> 00:42:14.760]   I mean, a lot of people are getting lightning adapters
[00:42:14.760 --> 00:42:17.280]   in their accessories now because Apple opened up the program.
[00:42:17.280 --> 00:42:18.520]   But because they opened up the program,
[00:42:18.520 --> 00:42:20.240]   there's incredible demand for lightning chips
[00:42:20.240 --> 00:42:21.120]   so they're hard to get.
[00:42:21.120 --> 00:42:22.480]   So it's one of those things where--
[00:42:22.480 --> 00:42:23.120]   You know, we're seeing--
[00:42:23.120 --> 00:42:25.520]   So we need a special chip to make a lightning cable.
[00:42:25.520 --> 00:42:27.160]   Yeah, because there's a lot of intelligence in the chip.
[00:42:27.160 --> 00:42:30.240]   It's a digital-- it can switch signals and do different things.
[00:42:30.240 --> 00:42:32.640]   So it's a specific chip that controls it.
[00:42:32.640 --> 00:42:34.080]   And now that it's open to anybody,
[00:42:34.080 --> 00:42:35.800]   you know, Mophie can put a lightning charger instead
[00:42:35.800 --> 00:42:37.760]   of a micro USB in their case.
[00:42:37.760 --> 00:42:39.920]   But they need the lightning chips and everyone
[00:42:39.920 --> 00:42:40.760]   is trying to buy them now.
[00:42:40.760 --> 00:42:41.280]   Got it.
[00:42:41.280 --> 00:42:45.400]   Who makes the lightning chips Samsung probably, right?
[00:42:45.400 --> 00:42:48.760]   Let's buy a couple of batteries.
[00:42:48.760 --> 00:42:53.200]   I was trying to think about how the new, really cool,
[00:42:53.200 --> 00:42:56.280]   rotation-dependent USB 3.0 micro connector
[00:42:56.280 --> 00:42:59.000]   changes the map for lightning.
[00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:02.360]   That it seems to do pretty much everything that--
[00:43:02.360 --> 00:43:06.040]   all the business stuff that the lightning connector would do.
[00:43:06.040 --> 00:43:10.040]   The idea of being able to not have so much tied
[00:43:10.040 --> 00:43:12.280]   into the cable itself and the idea
[00:43:12.280 --> 00:43:15.440]   that you won't have to just use it with Apple stuff.
[00:43:15.440 --> 00:43:17.040]   I mean, I'm already kind of sick and tired
[00:43:17.040 --> 00:43:18.960]   of making sure I'm packing two different kinds of cables
[00:43:18.960 --> 00:43:22.040]   whenever I leave the house.
[00:43:22.040 --> 00:43:25.680]   I know that the rumor 12-inch MacBook retina
[00:43:25.680 --> 00:43:31.720]   uses the-- again, speculatively uses the new connectors
[00:43:31.720 --> 00:43:33.000]   instead of lightning.
[00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:35.560]   But I wondered how that might change the map
[00:43:35.560 --> 00:43:37.320]   in the future if Apple might sometime--
[00:43:37.320 --> 00:43:39.560]   not in the next generation, but maybe the generation
[00:43:39.560 --> 00:43:44.000]   after that say, well, hell, if we have to support this new connector
[00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:45.760]   just to support other people's cameras,
[00:43:45.760 --> 00:43:47.720]   other people's devices, we may as well just
[00:43:47.720 --> 00:43:48.920]   use this on our phones as well.
[00:43:48.920 --> 00:43:49.480]   Right.
[00:43:49.480 --> 00:43:51.440]   We still angry with all their lightning accessories, they
[00:43:51.440 --> 00:43:52.720]   bought?
[00:43:52.720 --> 00:43:55.760]   So according to chip works, which tore these cables apart,
[00:43:55.760 --> 00:43:59.440]   there are four chips on a lightning cable.
[00:43:59.440 --> 00:44:03.760]   There are two transistors and NXP, NX20, P3,
[00:44:03.760 --> 00:44:06.920]   and a Texas Instruments unpublished Texas Instruments
[00:44:06.920 --> 00:44:09.480]   chip, which they think is a security feature if it's
[00:44:09.480 --> 00:44:11.240]   for authentication.
[00:44:11.240 --> 00:44:13.600]   So this is not-- look at that.
[00:44:13.600 --> 00:44:14.120]   Look at that.
[00:44:14.120 --> 00:44:15.280]   That's crazy.
[00:44:15.280 --> 00:44:18.160]   You got a motherboard in your cable.
[00:44:18.160 --> 00:44:18.920]   Crazy.
[00:44:18.920 --> 00:44:20.680]   Well, I mean, if you look at the old dock connector,
[00:44:20.680 --> 00:44:24.080]   they had 30 pins, but then some of those pins became obsolete.
[00:44:24.080 --> 00:44:26.800]   They had to reassign them, and older cables did firewire,
[00:44:26.800 --> 00:44:27.640]   and new ones.
[00:44:27.640 --> 00:44:28.960]   And it just became a bit of a mess,
[00:44:28.960 --> 00:44:31.080]   so they really wanted to be able to dynamically reassign
[00:44:31.080 --> 00:44:31.960]   all those pins.
[00:44:31.960 --> 00:44:32.880]   Yeah.
[00:44:32.880 --> 00:44:34.560]   This is a computer and a cable.
[00:44:34.560 --> 00:44:35.080]   Yeah.
[00:44:35.080 --> 00:44:36.720]   Kind of Lee.
[00:44:36.720 --> 00:44:37.240]   All right.
[00:44:37.240 --> 00:44:41.280]   So a TI makes at least one of the chips on there.
[00:44:41.280 --> 00:44:41.880]   I think it's a--
[00:44:41.880 --> 00:44:43.120]   What, three years ago?
[00:44:43.120 --> 00:44:44.920]   There's an EEPROM on it.
[00:44:44.920 --> 00:44:46.760]   An erasable program will read only memory
[00:44:46.760 --> 00:44:51.320]   with either 64 or 128 bits of storage.
[00:44:51.320 --> 00:44:52.840]   No, I'm certain.
[00:44:52.840 --> 00:44:54.280]   I'm confused to believe that no one
[00:44:54.280 --> 00:44:56.200]   has tried to create a version of Minecraft that
[00:44:56.200 --> 00:44:58.320]   runs on that chip.
[00:44:58.320 --> 00:45:01.400]   That's the first Doom and then Minecraft.
[00:45:01.400 --> 00:45:03.960]   That's the two rules you have to have it running everything.
[00:45:03.960 --> 00:45:05.440]   So this is wild.
[00:45:05.440 --> 00:45:08.080]   The real question is we saw Thunder Strike this week.
[00:45:08.080 --> 00:45:09.360]   Now we're going to have Lightning Strike.
[00:45:09.360 --> 00:45:10.480]   Lightning Strike.
[00:45:10.480 --> 00:45:11.480]   We'll talk about that, actually.
[00:45:11.480 --> 00:45:12.480]   We'll talk about that, actually.
[00:45:12.480 --> 00:45:13.880]   That was a juice-jacking, right?
[00:45:13.880 --> 00:45:15.200]   They've had that for a while.
[00:45:15.200 --> 00:45:15.720]   Yeah.
[00:45:15.720 --> 00:45:17.000]   We'll talk about Thunder Strike.
[00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:21.000]   We'll talk about other Mac news, including more speculation
[00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:25.360]   on this new Retina MacBook Air, particularly
[00:45:25.360 --> 00:45:27.600]   because one of the big announcements
[00:45:27.600 --> 00:45:29.160]   with the CES was these new Intel chips.
[00:45:29.160 --> 00:45:30.720]   And that means now the other shoe has dropped.
[00:45:30.720 --> 00:45:31.680]   The Broadwell U is here.
[00:45:31.680 --> 00:45:34.520]   So that's coming up as we continue on Mac break weekly.
[00:45:34.520 --> 00:45:38.160]   With Renee Ritchie from iMore.com, Andy and not Klinewin.
[00:45:38.160 --> 00:45:39.320]   I'm going to add a order.
[00:45:39.320 --> 00:45:42.720]   Andy and I go from Celestial Waste of Banwith.
[00:45:42.720 --> 00:45:46.000]   Also, Chicago sometimes, both equally important.
[00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:47.480]   Media outlets.
[00:45:47.480 --> 00:45:52.000]   And Adam Anxt, the man in charge at tidbits.com,
[00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:55.640]   along with Tanya's wife and that giant penguin.
[00:45:55.640 --> 00:45:57.560]   I'm sorry, life size.
[00:45:57.560 --> 00:46:00.040]   You're ignoring the coolest part.
[00:46:00.040 --> 00:46:02.800]   He has a copy of every edition of Internet Starter Kit by the--
[00:46:02.800 --> 00:46:03.840]   I saw that.
[00:46:03.840 --> 00:46:05.440]   He's got boxes on the internet behind him.
[00:46:05.440 --> 00:46:06.880]   He's still fulfilling orders, I think.
[00:46:06.880 --> 00:46:11.920]   That's every edition and translation.
[00:46:11.920 --> 00:46:13.920]   That's what that stack is.
[00:46:13.920 --> 00:46:16.040]   When did the Internet Starter Kit come out?
[00:46:16.040 --> 00:46:17.040]   1993.
[00:46:17.040 --> 00:46:19.560]   It was the fifth Internet book.
[00:46:19.560 --> 00:46:21.120]   And we were only fifth by a week.
[00:46:21.120 --> 00:46:22.880]   There were three that were out for a long time.
[00:46:22.880 --> 00:46:23.800]   We were out for a year or so.
[00:46:23.800 --> 00:46:28.120]   And then in Mac Internet tour guide, beat us by a week.
[00:46:28.120 --> 00:46:29.320]   But we had all the stuff you needed.
[00:46:29.320 --> 00:46:30.320]   Oh my god!
[00:46:30.320 --> 00:46:31.320]   Ah!
[00:46:31.320 --> 00:46:32.320]   Yes.
[00:46:32.320 --> 00:46:33.320]   Excellent.
[00:46:33.320 --> 00:46:35.160]   I need that on my computer.
[00:46:35.160 --> 00:46:38.920]   Can you get that on my computer, too?
[00:46:38.920 --> 00:46:41.000]   I remember going to the very first--
[00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:43.680]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:46:43.680 --> 00:46:45.800]   He's on a-- what is he on a stick?
[00:46:45.800 --> 00:46:47.240]   You got a penguin on a stick?
[00:46:47.240 --> 00:46:48.000]   Flying shadow.
[00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:51.600]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:46:51.600 --> 00:46:54.440]   Jason Howell on the keyboards there.
[00:46:54.440 --> 00:46:55.800]   Kitten on the keys, man.
[00:46:55.800 --> 00:46:57.600]   That's amazing.
[00:46:57.600 --> 00:47:00.160]   You tell me that every time that I've tried to fill time,
[00:47:00.160 --> 00:47:02.360]   I'm making up something that's not at halfway intelligent.
[00:47:02.360 --> 00:47:05.080]   You could have just put on an animated adorable penguin
[00:47:05.080 --> 00:47:07.720]   that people would have enjoyed twice as much.
[00:47:07.720 --> 00:47:11.560]   Only if YouTube has a version of that animated adorable penguin
[00:47:11.560 --> 00:47:12.800]   on top of a green screen.
[00:47:12.800 --> 00:47:14.120]   That's all about the greens.
[00:47:14.120 --> 00:47:15.200]   We got Shutterstock.
[00:47:15.200 --> 00:47:17.560]   Don't forget, Shutterstock could give you a lot of good stuff.
[00:47:17.560 --> 00:47:18.120]   Yeah, that's true.
[00:47:18.120 --> 00:47:19.920]   You get the watermark, but that's OK.
[00:47:19.920 --> 00:47:21.560]   Actually, we have a subscription.
[00:47:21.560 --> 00:47:23.400]   You could actually buy those.
[00:47:23.400 --> 00:47:27.480]   I remember going to the first Internet Expo, which has since gone.
[00:47:27.480 --> 00:47:29.280]   Oh, that lasted like three years.
[00:47:29.280 --> 00:47:31.760]   But it was so fun because it was tiny, right?
[00:47:31.760 --> 00:47:33.920]   And there was like 10 people.
[00:47:33.920 --> 00:47:36.320]   And I remember O'Reilly there with a pile of internet
[00:47:36.320 --> 00:47:37.760]   in a box kits.
[00:47:37.760 --> 00:47:40.000]   So this was actually a little later than your starter kit.
[00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:42.360]   But this actually had disks because you got--
[00:47:42.360 --> 00:47:43.400]   I don't think you got Netscape.
[00:47:43.400 --> 00:47:44.640]   I think this is earlier than that.
[00:47:44.640 --> 00:47:45.920]   I think you got Mozilla.
[00:47:45.920 --> 00:47:46.440]   What was it?
[00:47:46.440 --> 00:47:47.800]   No Mosaic.
[00:47:47.800 --> 00:47:50.240]   So yeah, well, it was NCSM Mosaic.
[00:47:50.240 --> 00:47:53.520]   But we shipped--
[00:47:53.520 --> 00:47:55.160]   the first web browser we shipped with,
[00:47:55.160 --> 00:47:57.520]   what I believe was Mac Webb, which was actually
[00:47:57.520 --> 00:47:59.840]   the first one for the Mac.
[00:47:59.840 --> 00:48:01.600]   That was based on Mosaic, as I remember.
[00:48:01.600 --> 00:48:02.440]   Is that right?
[00:48:02.440 --> 00:48:03.680]   No, it was actually completely separate.
[00:48:03.680 --> 00:48:07.360]   It was done by Robert Kayo at CERN.
[00:48:07.360 --> 00:48:08.960]   He worked with Tim Berners-Lee.
[00:48:08.960 --> 00:48:10.720]   And it wasn't a very good program.
[00:48:10.720 --> 00:48:13.960]   But it was the first web browser for the Mac.
[00:48:13.960 --> 00:48:18.960]   And then, yes, then NCSM Mosaic and after that Netscape.
[00:48:18.960 --> 00:48:20.760]   And we actually never put Netscape on a book.
[00:48:20.760 --> 00:48:23.960]   I mean, the disks, we had all this offer you needed,
[00:48:23.960 --> 00:48:25.520]   which is why the book did so well.
[00:48:25.520 --> 00:48:27.600]   But the problem with Netscape was,
[00:48:27.600 --> 00:48:31.560]   is they wanted $5 a copy, which was insane.
[00:48:31.560 --> 00:48:34.560]   And so, and remember, the time Internet Explorer
[00:48:34.560 --> 00:48:36.120]   was the underdog.
[00:48:36.120 --> 00:48:37.960]   So we went over to Microsoft, and they said,
[00:48:37.960 --> 00:48:40.200]   oh, sure, you can have Internet Explorer for free.
[00:48:40.200 --> 00:48:42.760]   OK, that's our decision not to make.
[00:48:42.760 --> 00:48:46.120]   Yeah, that's when Netscape went under, I think.
[00:48:46.120 --> 00:48:46.960]   Pretty much.
[00:48:46.960 --> 00:48:49.600]   That was the cause of it, because they were greedy.
[00:48:49.600 --> 00:48:51.880]   The bundled with all the books, they would have been there.
[00:48:51.880 --> 00:48:52.680]   Yeah.
[00:48:52.680 --> 00:48:54.040]   They wanted to charge for Netscape,
[00:48:54.040 --> 00:48:55.560]   and the long comes Microsoft.
[00:48:55.560 --> 00:48:57.880]   And the first IE1 was terrible, and two was terrible,
[00:48:57.880 --> 00:48:59.200]   but three was OK.
[00:48:59.200 --> 00:49:00.640]   Through as usable as I remember.
[00:49:00.640 --> 00:49:02.440]   Always three.
[00:49:02.440 --> 00:49:03.520]   Yeah, always, isn't it?
[00:49:03.520 --> 00:49:04.760]   That's probably where that started.
[00:49:04.760 --> 00:49:06.960]   No, Windows 3.
[00:49:06.960 --> 00:49:09.560]   Yeah.
[00:49:09.560 --> 00:49:11.640]   We're going to take a break, come back with more.
[00:49:11.640 --> 00:49:13.080]   Loved having these three people.
[00:49:13.080 --> 00:49:14.760]   This is a good group.
[00:49:14.760 --> 00:49:17.000]   Our show today brought to you by another good group
[00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:17.960]   in New York City.
[00:49:17.960 --> 00:49:21.560]   The folks who do Squarespace is simply the best place
[00:49:21.560 --> 00:49:22.800]   to host your website.
[00:49:22.800 --> 00:49:24.680]   Your first website, your next website.
[00:49:24.680 --> 00:49:27.640]   Maybe you're not getting the most response on your website.
[00:49:27.640 --> 00:49:29.800]   Maybe your website doesn't look as good as it should.
[00:49:29.800 --> 00:49:32.680]   Squarespace does it for you.
[00:49:32.680 --> 00:49:35.200]   Like they just launched Squarespace 7.
[00:49:35.200 --> 00:49:36.400]   These guys don't stop.
[00:49:36.400 --> 00:49:37.960]   They don't rest.
[00:49:37.960 --> 00:49:40.760]   It's amazing, the completely redesigned interface.
[00:49:40.760 --> 00:49:42.200]   It's easy now.
[00:49:42.200 --> 00:49:43.360]   There's no more preview mode.
[00:49:43.360 --> 00:49:46.000]   So you're working on your site.
[00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:46.640]   You say, you know what?
[00:49:46.640 --> 00:49:48.160]   That border ought to be bigger.
[00:49:48.160 --> 00:49:49.680]   Or can I add a Twitter feed?
[00:49:49.680 --> 00:49:50.960]   And you just do it.
[00:49:50.960 --> 00:49:53.120]   You don't have to toggle between the site manager
[00:49:53.120 --> 00:49:54.120]   and the preview mode.
[00:49:54.120 --> 00:49:56.440]   You can see how your changes look on tablets and mobile devices,
[00:49:56.440 --> 00:49:59.320]   too, because Squarespace is what we call mobile responsive.
[00:49:59.320 --> 00:50:03.360]   It looks great on all sites, all-size screens.
[00:50:03.360 --> 00:50:06.760]   14 new designs give you a total of 30 templates, including--
[00:50:06.760 --> 00:50:08.800]   and this is for the first time--
[00:50:08.800 --> 00:50:10.640]   specific profession templates.
[00:50:10.640 --> 00:50:15.000]   So they've got architects, restaurants, e-commerce,
[00:50:15.000 --> 00:50:18.280]   bands, artists.
[00:50:18.280 --> 00:50:20.600]   For instance, the Fulton template
[00:50:20.600 --> 00:50:23.960]   has long scrolling pages with background images
[00:50:23.960 --> 00:50:26.080]   in full width, galleries, and albums.
[00:50:26.080 --> 00:50:28.120]   Great for an agency, for a restaurant.
[00:50:28.120 --> 00:50:31.560]   Anybody wants to show off images, even a band.
[00:50:31.560 --> 00:50:32.760]   It's just gorgeous.
[00:50:32.760 --> 00:50:35.000]   Cover pages, too, now.
[00:50:35.000 --> 00:50:37.760]   You've got 10 templates for creating quick landing
[00:50:37.760 --> 00:50:39.480]   pages for your brand, your personal identity
[00:50:39.480 --> 00:50:40.480]   to promote a new product.
[00:50:40.480 --> 00:50:42.320]   That makes it very easy to do.
[00:50:42.320 --> 00:50:44.320]   Google Docs integration.
[00:50:44.320 --> 00:50:44.880]   That's nice.
[00:50:44.880 --> 00:50:48.200]   Works with Gmail, Google Docs, Sheets, Drive, Calendar.
[00:50:48.200 --> 00:50:50.720]   And you can even easily link branded email accounts
[00:50:50.720 --> 00:50:53.600]   to your domain.
[00:50:53.600 --> 00:50:54.760]   They're good developers.
[00:50:54.760 --> 00:50:56.240]   So good that, in fact, some of these guys
[00:50:56.240 --> 00:50:57.200]   had some extra cycles.
[00:50:57.200 --> 00:51:00.440]   You may know Squarespace just in a note app, just for fun.
[00:51:00.440 --> 00:51:01.520]   They now have-- how many?
[00:51:01.520 --> 00:51:02.360]   One, two, three, four.
[00:51:02.360 --> 00:51:04.240]   It looks like they've got four different apps,
[00:51:04.240 --> 00:51:07.280]   the Portfolio app for photographers, which pulls images
[00:51:07.280 --> 00:51:09.720]   from your site and creates a beautiful portfolio
[00:51:09.720 --> 00:51:13.920]   on your iPad so you can show your clients your ride.
[00:51:13.920 --> 00:51:15.400]   The notes app is still there.
[00:51:15.400 --> 00:51:18.160]   In fact, it's now available in Android, as well as iOS.
[00:51:18.160 --> 00:51:20.480]   Metric, which gives you all the stats on your site,
[00:51:20.480 --> 00:51:22.880]   including social media follows.
[00:51:22.880 --> 00:51:26.240]   And the Blog app, which lets you post moderate comments
[00:51:26.240 --> 00:51:30.680]   anywhere, Blog is also available on Android now.
[00:51:30.680 --> 00:51:32.760]   Developer platform is awesome.
[00:51:32.760 --> 00:51:35.200]   If you don't have to be a whiz to use Squarespace,
[00:51:35.200 --> 00:51:39.920]   but if you are a developer, you can customize it infinitely.
[00:51:39.920 --> 00:51:42.840]   This platform used by some of the world's top digital agencies
[00:51:42.840 --> 00:51:45.320]   to create sites for their clients.
[00:51:45.320 --> 00:51:47.120]   You're using basically the same coding platform.
[00:51:47.120 --> 00:51:50.360]   Squarespace uses Getty Images, built-in, e-commerce,
[00:51:50.360 --> 00:51:53.000]   built-in, social media.
[00:51:53.000 --> 00:51:54.560]   And all of this, just $8 a month.
[00:51:54.560 --> 00:51:56.160]   And that includes a free domain name
[00:51:56.160 --> 00:51:57.200]   when you register for a year.
[00:51:57.200 --> 00:51:58.640]   But look, here's the deal.
[00:51:58.640 --> 00:51:59.640]   Aren't these gorgeous?
[00:51:59.640 --> 00:52:01.280]   I mean, they are really gorgeous.
[00:52:01.280 --> 00:52:02.000]   Just try it.
[00:52:02.000 --> 00:52:02.960]   You don't need a credit card.
[00:52:02.960 --> 00:52:05.280]   If you go to squarespace.com, you don't even
[00:52:05.280 --> 00:52:06.080]   need our offer code.
[00:52:06.080 --> 00:52:07.560]   Just click the Get Started button,
[00:52:07.560 --> 00:52:10.080]   and you'll be using Squarespace immediately.
[00:52:10.080 --> 00:52:12.840]   You've got two weeks to create a site.
[00:52:12.840 --> 00:52:15.400]   You can import up to 10 records from your existing site
[00:52:15.400 --> 00:52:17.280]   to see what it looks like.
[00:52:17.280 --> 00:52:18.280]   Really get a sense of it.
[00:52:18.280 --> 00:52:22.840]   Switch templates to your hearts, the light.
[00:52:22.840 --> 00:52:24.640]   And by the way, if you're an existing customer,
[00:52:24.640 --> 00:52:25.640]   each seven is available to you.
[00:52:25.640 --> 00:52:28.080]   Just go to your sit-in's tab and you can click a button.
[00:52:28.080 --> 00:52:29.200]   squarespace.com.
[00:52:29.200 --> 00:52:30.840]   All I ask is if you decide to buy,
[00:52:30.840 --> 00:52:33.520]   and I know you will, get 10% off by using our offer code
[00:52:33.520 --> 00:52:34.240]   MACBreak.
[00:52:34.240 --> 00:52:36.160]   Squarespace, start here.
[00:52:36.160 --> 00:52:37.360]   Go anywhere.
[00:52:37.360 --> 00:52:41.520]   Don't forget the offer code MACBreak for 10% off.
[00:52:41.520 --> 00:52:44.440]   Leo, the Port MACBreak weekly.
[00:52:44.440 --> 00:52:46.080]   This isn't our first episode of the New Year.
[00:52:46.080 --> 00:52:47.400]   It's our second.
[00:52:47.400 --> 00:52:49.320]   But it's our first episode after CES.
[00:52:49.320 --> 00:52:52.640]   Really, the year doesn't begin till CES.
[00:52:52.640 --> 00:52:53.720]   That's when it really starts.
[00:52:53.720 --> 00:52:55.800]   Can't start the New Year till the old CES is over.
[00:52:55.800 --> 00:52:57.360]   Yeah, right.
[00:52:57.360 --> 00:52:59.040]   Or rather, until you recover from the cold,
[00:52:59.040 --> 00:53:01.240]   you picked up at CES.
[00:53:01.240 --> 00:53:03.120]   Adam mentioned thunder strike.
[00:53:03.120 --> 00:53:06.800]   This is-- you know, it's--
[00:53:06.800 --> 00:53:08.480]   so this is a category of attacks
[00:53:08.480 --> 00:53:09.880]   that have been around for a while.
[00:53:09.880 --> 00:53:13.760]   Any thing, including Firewire or ESATA,
[00:53:13.760 --> 00:53:15.720]   that gives you direct memory access,
[00:53:15.720 --> 00:53:17.480]   DMA to the internals of the computer,
[00:53:17.480 --> 00:53:20.200]   can be used to read the memory of the computer.
[00:53:20.200 --> 00:53:24.720]   So, Tremel Hudson, who's a security guy,
[00:53:24.720 --> 00:53:27.000]   found out that, yes, thunderbolt can do that as well.
[00:53:27.000 --> 00:53:29.640]   Give-- if attack-- but attack has to have physical access
[00:53:29.640 --> 00:53:31.480]   to your Mac.
[00:53:31.480 --> 00:53:33.360]   And you have to-- it's actually kind of complicated.
[00:53:33.360 --> 00:53:36.040]   You have to reinstall firmware and so forth.
[00:53:36.040 --> 00:53:37.800]   This is-- well, this is a little bit different, actually.
[00:53:37.800 --> 00:53:39.560]   This is not a direct memory access attack.
[00:53:39.560 --> 00:53:40.480]   It's not.
[00:53:40.480 --> 00:53:42.000]   Oh, I'm sorry I thought it was.
[00:53:42.000 --> 00:53:46.600]   Well, it's-- it's a-- that category is how it gets started.
[00:53:46.600 --> 00:53:49.160]   But what's interesting about thunder strike
[00:53:49.160 --> 00:53:54.720]   is that you can plug in a malicious thunderbolt dongle
[00:53:54.720 --> 00:53:56.640]   and-- and--
[00:53:56.640 --> 00:53:59.080]   I just like the concept of thunderbolt dongle.
[00:53:59.080 --> 00:54:00.000]   Yeah, I love that.
[00:54:00.000 --> 00:54:02.640]   That was a cover band, MTD, yeah.
[00:54:02.640 --> 00:54:04.640]   Yeah, clearly a band name.
[00:54:04.640 --> 00:54:11.000]   And reboot the Mac and it will rewrite the firmware,
[00:54:11.000 --> 00:54:13.280]   the boot firmware of the Mac.
[00:54:13.280 --> 00:54:15.000]   And change the--
[00:54:15.000 --> 00:54:18.200]   change the key so you can't fix it.
[00:54:18.200 --> 00:54:18.600]   Right.
[00:54:18.600 --> 00:54:19.600]   Precisely.
[00:54:19.600 --> 00:54:21.760]   I mean, this is-- this falls into the category of--
[00:54:21.760 --> 00:54:23.400]   if you-- the only way to fix this,
[00:54:23.400 --> 00:54:25.520]   I suspect would be to replace the motherboard.
[00:54:25.520 --> 00:54:27.160]   Holy moly.
[00:54:27.160 --> 00:54:28.800]   And this is a proof of concept.
[00:54:28.800 --> 00:54:30.280]   It's not done.
[00:54:30.280 --> 00:54:32.240]   I mean, you know, it's not like, you know, oh, yeah,
[00:54:32.240 --> 00:54:34.360]   he showed that you could actually do-- he showed that the attack
[00:54:34.360 --> 00:54:36.640]   worked and that he could do this.
[00:54:36.640 --> 00:54:39.600]   But he didn't actually write new firmware code that
[00:54:39.600 --> 00:54:40.800]   was malicious to be--
[00:54:40.800 --> 00:54:43.760]   So he's not-- he's not using a DMA to read and ram.
[00:54:43.760 --> 00:54:45.320]   He's actually somehow-- what is it?
[00:54:45.320 --> 00:54:47.080]   But you're-- but you're writing ram, right?
[00:54:47.080 --> 00:54:47.880]   Because you're-- you must be--
[00:54:47.880 --> 00:54:49.000]   no, no, no, no.
[00:54:49.000 --> 00:54:51.440]   It's only dealing with the-- with the boot firmware.
[00:54:51.440 --> 00:54:51.960]   Wow.
[00:54:51.960 --> 00:54:54.160]   And that's-- that's what's fascinating about this,
[00:54:54.160 --> 00:54:57.240]   because all you have to do is plug in this device
[00:54:57.240 --> 00:55:00.280]   and then reboot the computer and you own it.
[00:55:00.280 --> 00:55:02.920]   Because it's-- your code is then at the firmware level.
[00:55:02.920 --> 00:55:04.720]   You can't stop this with software,
[00:55:04.720 --> 00:55:06.960]   because the software is never loaded.
[00:55:06.960 --> 00:55:09.400]   The operating system comes a lot later.
[00:55:09.400 --> 00:55:13.920]   So theoretically, you could create a malicious thunderbolt
[00:55:13.920 --> 00:55:14.880]   device, right?
[00:55:14.880 --> 00:55:17.080]   And just like a thunderbolt USB key.
[00:55:17.080 --> 00:55:18.960]   This is like bad USB.
[00:55:18.960 --> 00:55:21.640]   And give it to the person and say, hey, just reboot before you
[00:55:21.640 --> 00:55:22.480]   use it.
[00:55:22.480 --> 00:55:24.480]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:55:24.480 --> 00:55:25.240]   Yeah, I mean--
[00:55:25.240 --> 00:55:26.560]   So I have that physical access.
[00:55:26.560 --> 00:55:27.960]   You just have to get them to plug something
[00:55:27.960 --> 00:55:28.920]   into their thunderbolt.
[00:55:28.920 --> 00:55:32.360]   This is probably not so much a social engineering situation
[00:55:32.360 --> 00:55:35.160]   as what I believe in the security industry is called
[00:55:35.160 --> 00:55:36.640]   the evil-made problem.
[00:55:36.640 --> 00:55:39.080]   You know, you leave your computer in the hotel room.
[00:55:39.080 --> 00:55:40.840]   All they have to do is plug this thing and reboot it.
[00:55:40.840 --> 00:55:43.640]   And you can reboot any computer by holding the power case.
[00:55:43.640 --> 00:55:44.720]   Easy.
[00:55:44.720 --> 00:55:48.720]   And so either that or if you are traveling internationally
[00:55:48.720 --> 00:55:51.560]   at customs, when they can take your computer away
[00:55:51.560 --> 00:55:53.240]   and do whatever the hell they want with it,
[00:55:53.240 --> 00:55:55.120]   doesn't matter what kind of passwords you got.
[00:55:55.120 --> 00:55:57.320]   Firmware passwords do not help.
[00:55:57.320 --> 00:55:59.640]   And obviously, nothing you can do the operating system level
[00:55:59.640 --> 00:56:00.120]   helps.
[00:56:00.120 --> 00:56:03.880]   So what it comes down to is the only protection
[00:56:03.880 --> 00:56:07.280]   against this sort of attack-- again, this one isn't an attack
[00:56:07.280 --> 00:56:08.800]   yet, just to prove a concept--
[00:56:08.800 --> 00:56:10.880]   is maintaining physical control of your computer
[00:56:10.880 --> 00:56:11.920]   at all times.
[00:56:11.920 --> 00:56:15.080]   And when you are in the kind of situations
[00:56:15.080 --> 00:56:20.680]   where you as a corporate executive or a tech
[00:56:20.680 --> 00:56:23.840]   person for a big company or a government employee
[00:56:23.840 --> 00:56:27.840]   could be targeted, this is a very directed attack.
[00:56:27.840 --> 00:56:30.840]   And we have seen this people coming into the US
[00:56:30.840 --> 00:56:35.600]   and other countries, they can legally take your stuff briefly.
[00:56:35.600 --> 00:56:38.600]   Even if you're a US citizen, when you're a customs,
[00:56:38.600 --> 00:56:39.560]   you have no rights.
[00:56:39.560 --> 00:56:41.520]   They could say, hey, we'd like to look at your laptop
[00:56:41.520 --> 00:56:42.520]   briefly.
[00:56:42.520 --> 00:56:43.680]   And come back with it.
[00:56:43.680 --> 00:56:45.600]   So boring that no one would ever want anything that's
[00:56:45.600 --> 00:56:46.680]   on my computer.
[00:56:46.680 --> 00:56:47.960]   Oh, OK, so boring.
[00:56:47.960 --> 00:56:48.680]   So boring.
[00:56:48.680 --> 00:56:53.120]   But it's-- so once-- let's say it's happened to you.
[00:56:53.120 --> 00:56:55.200]   What kinds of things could they do?
[00:56:55.200 --> 00:56:57.520]   They could have it behave normally, right?
[00:56:57.520 --> 00:57:01.600]   Except that every five days it sends all the keystrokes
[00:57:01.600 --> 00:57:03.160]   back to the home office.
[00:57:03.160 --> 00:57:07.480]   Anything in theory that could be fit into this firm boot
[00:57:07.480 --> 00:57:08.280]   firmware code--
[00:57:08.280 --> 00:57:10.120]   But this still is the programmer.
[00:57:10.120 --> 00:57:11.400]   You're obviously, yeah.
[00:57:11.400 --> 00:57:15.400]   Basically what the guy said was that it was very easy
[00:57:15.400 --> 00:57:17.800]   to imagine this being weaponized.
[00:57:17.800 --> 00:57:18.560]   Right.
[00:57:18.560 --> 00:57:19.440]   Kind of was the--
[00:57:19.440 --> 00:57:22.880]   Well, I've never seen NSA attacks of this kind.
[00:57:22.880 --> 00:57:23.920]   Or Stuxnet.
[00:57:23.920 --> 00:57:24.680]   Stuxnet.
[00:57:24.680 --> 00:57:25.040]   Stuxnet.
[00:57:25.040 --> 00:57:28.600]   Well, but also bad USB takes advantage of the fact
[00:57:28.600 --> 00:57:31.960]   that there are EEPROMs in all USB devices.
[00:57:31.960 --> 00:57:33.880]   So it's the same idea.
[00:57:33.880 --> 00:57:37.080]   These are electronically erasable programmable read-only
[00:57:37.080 --> 00:57:37.720]   memories.
[00:57:37.720 --> 00:57:39.160]   That's the boot ROM.
[00:57:39.160 --> 00:57:40.160]   That's the EFI ROM in the--
[00:57:40.160 --> 00:57:43.160]   Stuxnet attacks that we saw with plug accessories.
[00:57:43.160 --> 00:57:43.480]   And yeah.
[00:57:43.480 --> 00:57:44.800]   Right.
[00:57:44.800 --> 00:57:46.760]   That's why it's a bad idea to use when
[00:57:46.760 --> 00:57:50.280]   you see public charging stations to use any of those.
[00:57:50.280 --> 00:57:52.840]   There's also-- I mean, I was talking to some people
[00:57:52.840 --> 00:57:56.000]   a couple of years ago whose job it is to harden hardware
[00:57:56.000 --> 00:57:59.720]   for travel to places that they're expecting.
[00:57:59.720 --> 00:58:02.920]   Business travelers who are doing really, really high-profile
[00:58:02.920 --> 00:58:06.520]   deals, where they have a reason to expect that a government
[00:58:06.520 --> 00:58:10.040]   will want to get access to their data at some point.
[00:58:10.040 --> 00:58:12.760]   And they talked about three different things
[00:58:12.760 --> 00:58:16.080]   to do, one of which is from low-level stuff,
[00:58:16.080 --> 00:58:19.680]   like you can buy security tape, that tamper tape.
[00:58:19.680 --> 00:58:21.000]   You simply cover your ports with this.
[00:58:21.000 --> 00:58:23.400]   So you will at least know that, OK, this person had no--
[00:58:23.400 --> 00:58:25.880]   there's no reason why the seal over my USB port
[00:58:25.880 --> 00:58:26.520]   should have been broken.
[00:58:26.520 --> 00:58:27.440]   But there it is broken.
[00:58:27.440 --> 00:58:29.600]   I need to now not trust this computer.
[00:58:29.600 --> 00:58:33.400]   Two special cases for phones where it will simply block
[00:58:33.400 --> 00:58:34.240]   all these ports.
[00:58:34.240 --> 00:58:36.800]   Then you have to, again, physically break this thing off.
[00:58:36.800 --> 00:58:39.840]   And you cannot put it back on again to do something like that.
[00:58:39.840 --> 00:58:41.640]   But the third thing, which was the most interesting,
[00:58:41.640 --> 00:58:43.120]   is to say that if you are really
[00:58:43.120 --> 00:58:47.120]   transacting on that level by burner-- not just burner laptops,
[00:58:47.120 --> 00:58:50.040]   but they recommend Chromebooks, where you just--
[00:58:50.040 --> 00:58:51.640]   it's a very low-profile sort of thing.
[00:58:51.640 --> 00:58:57.280]   And basically, you just simply set fire to it when you leave.
[00:58:57.280 --> 00:59:00.000]   They actually have mentioned things like,
[00:59:00.000 --> 00:59:02.280]   you can secure wipe some of the data.
[00:59:02.280 --> 00:59:04.220]   And some of them actually use these old things.
[00:59:04.220 --> 00:59:07.440]   Like, almost as gratuities when they leave.
[00:59:07.440 --> 00:59:09.640]   But the idea is that here is what you remove.
[00:59:09.640 --> 00:59:10.400]   Here's what you do.
[00:59:10.400 --> 00:59:13.580]   But do not even consider taking a device you've
[00:59:13.580 --> 00:59:15.240]   introduced into a foreign network,
[00:59:15.240 --> 00:59:18.160]   I mean, another country, and then taking it back home
[00:59:18.160 --> 00:59:20.640]   and introducing it back to a network that you're using.
[00:59:20.640 --> 00:59:21.640]   There you go.
[00:59:21.640 --> 00:59:22.680]   Is there a fix for this?
[00:59:22.680 --> 00:59:24.160]   Has Apple patched this?
[00:59:24.160 --> 00:59:26.080]   Apple is aware of it, absolutely.
[00:59:26.080 --> 00:59:31.400]   And in the newest Macs, the Retina iMac and the new Mac Mini,
[00:59:31.400 --> 00:59:33.640]   it is partially addressed.
[00:59:33.640 --> 00:59:37.100]   And Apple has told Rich Mogola, a security editor,
[00:59:37.100 --> 00:59:40.820]   that they are working on firmware patches for other Macs.
[00:59:40.820 --> 00:59:44.380]   That's kind of interesting, because the 5K came out last year.
[00:59:44.380 --> 00:59:46.980]   So they've known about this for longer than we have.
[00:59:46.980 --> 00:59:48.340]   Well, and I mean, I think this is--
[00:59:48.340 --> 00:59:50.340]   I mean, this guy is a legitimate researcher.
[00:59:50.340 --> 00:59:52.420]   So when you're a legitimate researcher,
[00:59:52.420 --> 00:59:54.660]   you tell the company in advance.
[00:59:54.660 --> 00:59:56.260]   Right, before you tell anybody else.
[00:59:56.260 --> 00:59:58.420]   They also have security teams that just, in general,
[00:59:58.420 --> 01:00:01.780]   work on hardening things all the time as well.
[01:00:01.780 --> 01:00:06.500]   Is it possible to back patch the firmware and prevent this?
[01:00:06.500 --> 01:00:07.180]   Seems like a heart.
[01:00:07.180 --> 01:00:09.400]   You need a hardware fix, almost.
[01:00:09.400 --> 01:00:11.900]   Yeah, as far as I know, you would sort of
[01:00:11.900 --> 01:00:13.660]   have to do the same thing in reverse.
[01:00:13.660 --> 01:00:16.580]   And I can't really imagine Apple doing that.
[01:00:16.580 --> 01:00:19.100]   It strikes me as much more like you'd
[01:00:19.100 --> 01:00:21.460]   want to do something where--
[01:00:21.460 --> 01:00:22.900]   basically, Apple's opinion was you just
[01:00:22.900 --> 01:00:24.820]   come in and get a new motherboard.
[01:00:24.820 --> 01:00:26.500]   They know how to do that.
[01:00:26.500 --> 01:00:28.060]   It was funny when I was editing this article.
[01:00:28.060 --> 01:00:31.740]   I remembered way back in the day when I was a student at Cornell.
[01:00:31.740 --> 01:00:35.580]   We had a bunch of public rooms with laser writers.
[01:00:35.580 --> 01:00:37.940]   And people may not know this, but laser writers all
[01:00:37.940 --> 01:00:39.980]   had passwords built into them.
[01:00:39.980 --> 01:00:41.740]   And you could change the password
[01:00:41.740 --> 01:00:44.180]   with a PostScript program.
[01:00:44.180 --> 01:00:46.100]   The passwords were always zero.
[01:00:46.100 --> 01:00:49.740]   So then the printer driver knew to basically send password
[01:00:49.740 --> 01:00:52.020]   zero to be able to print to the laser writer.
[01:00:52.020 --> 01:00:54.900]   But some student at Cornell figured this out
[01:00:54.900 --> 01:00:58.060]   and changed the password in one of our laser writers.
[01:00:58.060 --> 01:01:02.220]   And there were 32,767 possible numbers.
[01:01:02.220 --> 01:01:06.980]   And it took 11 seconds to do a try on a number.
[01:01:06.980 --> 01:01:10.020]   So we calculated that it was going to take three months
[01:01:10.020 --> 01:01:12.900]   or something to run a program to find this.
[01:01:12.900 --> 01:01:17.500]   Even worse, it was an EEPROM that only had 10,000 writes.
[01:01:17.500 --> 01:01:20.100]   So you would kill it a third of the way through.
[01:01:20.100 --> 01:01:22.580]   And so basically, what we were faced with
[01:01:22.580 --> 01:01:24.980]   was replacing the motherboard and this laser writer.
[01:01:24.980 --> 01:01:29.660]   And then finally, either the guy or a friend or someone
[01:01:29.660 --> 01:01:32.540]   kind of let us know what the password was.
[01:01:32.540 --> 01:01:33.740]   And we were able to change it.
[01:01:33.740 --> 01:01:34.100]   Because--
[01:01:34.100 --> 01:01:35.940]   He just want to have that printer to be his own,
[01:01:35.940 --> 01:01:37.220]   no one else could use it.
[01:01:37.220 --> 01:01:39.300]   Yeah, basically, because the printer was--
[01:01:39.300 --> 01:01:40.380]   Then it would sit there.
[01:01:40.380 --> 01:01:41.660]   It would have a down sign on it.
[01:01:41.660 --> 01:01:42.540]   He could walk over there.
[01:01:42.540 --> 01:01:43.540]   He'd just--
[01:01:43.540 --> 01:01:44.940]   Holy cow.
[01:01:44.940 --> 01:01:45.460]   Yeah.
[01:01:45.460 --> 01:01:46.300]   That was fun.
[01:01:46.300 --> 01:01:47.860]   If you have access--
[01:01:47.860 --> 01:01:50.220]   Adam and I probably have shared experiences
[01:01:50.220 --> 01:01:52.860]   in our respective computer labs during the '80s,
[01:01:52.860 --> 01:01:54.540]   where if you had access to the red and the blue books
[01:01:54.540 --> 01:01:56.100]   that Apple-- that Adobe published,
[01:01:56.100 --> 01:01:57.340]   you could do all kinds of things.
[01:01:57.340 --> 01:01:59.900]   Like, I remember one time there was a fellow who thought
[01:01:59.900 --> 01:02:01.500]   that, hey, look, laser printer, I know,
[01:02:01.500 --> 01:02:02.860]   I'll print my own letterhead.
[01:02:02.860 --> 01:02:05.340]   And rather than I'll print two or three copies and photocopy,
[01:02:05.340 --> 01:02:08.780]   then no, I'll print page after page after page after page.
[01:02:08.780 --> 01:02:10.780]   And didn't understand why.
[01:02:10.780 --> 01:02:12.140]   At the second time, we tried to do it.
[01:02:12.140 --> 01:02:13.300]   It would always-- it was always
[01:02:13.300 --> 01:02:15.220]   bork itself after page like 11.
[01:02:15.220 --> 01:02:17.420]   It's because, OK, I'm on the network now.
[01:02:17.420 --> 01:02:19.940]   I'm looking at this input queue and say, oh, no.
[01:02:19.940 --> 01:02:21.420]   He doesn't get to do that.
[01:02:21.420 --> 01:02:24.820]   We should point out that this does require--
[01:02:24.820 --> 01:02:26.460]   if it's not-- even though it's not DMA,
[01:02:26.460 --> 01:02:28.300]   it does require the kind of access
[01:02:28.300 --> 01:02:32.620]   that Thunderbolt or maybe Firewire has not USB.
[01:02:32.620 --> 01:02:33.980]   Yeah, full Thunderbolt.
[01:02:33.980 --> 01:02:36.900]   But just in case anyone doesn't know what Andy was talking about.
[01:02:36.900 --> 01:02:38.580]   Oh, look at that.
[01:02:38.580 --> 01:02:39.340]   I love it.
[01:02:39.340 --> 01:02:42.500]   Those books in Beneath Apple DOS, those were like--
[01:02:42.500 --> 01:02:44.380]   that's like having the Necronomicon.
[01:02:44.380 --> 01:02:46.180]   It's like--
[01:02:46.180 --> 01:02:47.420]   Post-Script programming.
[01:02:47.420 --> 01:02:48.820]   Nice.
[01:02:48.820 --> 01:02:49.500]   Nice.
[01:02:49.500 --> 01:02:52.620]   I do-- I think I remember writing one bit of code in Post-Script,
[01:02:52.620 --> 01:02:54.300]   and then I stopped.
[01:02:54.300 --> 01:02:55.340]   It's not better of it.
[01:02:55.340 --> 01:02:56.900]   I had a friend who actually wrote
[01:02:56.900 --> 01:02:59.700]   someone other friend's resume in Post-Script.
[01:02:59.700 --> 01:03:00.220]   Yeah.
[01:03:00.220 --> 01:03:04.020]   This was before we had a decent Mac-right level of programs,
[01:03:04.020 --> 01:03:06.220]   and he actually programmed her resume.
[01:03:06.220 --> 01:03:09.500]   It's like using a tech or something.
[01:03:09.500 --> 01:03:12.060]   You're writing at a very low level.
[01:03:12.060 --> 01:03:15.420]   Is Post-Script gone, by the way?
[01:03:15.420 --> 01:03:16.740]   That's actually a good question.
[01:03:16.740 --> 01:03:18.460]   I was wondering that recently, too.
[01:03:18.460 --> 01:03:19.740]   What's in the laser writer?
[01:03:19.740 --> 01:03:21.260]   What's printers these days?
[01:03:21.260 --> 01:03:23.020]   Yeah, what do printers do these days?
[01:03:23.020 --> 01:03:23.900]   I think there were--
[01:03:23.900 --> 01:03:26.660]   Like there were other-- there was like GDI.
[01:03:26.660 --> 01:03:29.580]   There were other ways to write images to a laser printer.
[01:03:29.580 --> 01:03:31.940]   I don't know what printers do these days.
[01:03:31.940 --> 01:03:32.940]   I don't know what--
[01:03:32.940 --> 01:03:34.540]   He had something.
[01:03:34.540 --> 01:03:35.500]   Yeah.
[01:03:35.500 --> 01:03:36.460]   In their own language.
[01:03:36.460 --> 01:03:37.580]   PCL.
[01:03:37.580 --> 01:03:40.100]   PCL, a PCL, a political language.
[01:03:40.100 --> 01:03:42.580]   And there was display Post-Script, which was awesome.
[01:03:42.580 --> 01:03:46.020]   Well, then PDFs are still in Post-Script, I think.
[01:03:46.020 --> 01:03:47.380]   PDF is based in Post-Script.
[01:03:47.380 --> 01:03:48.180]   Yeah.
[01:03:48.180 --> 01:03:50.860]   That's the display Post-Script and the next famously
[01:03:50.860 --> 01:03:51.740]   used display Post-Script.
[01:03:51.740 --> 01:03:53.820]   So to BOS, right?
[01:03:53.820 --> 01:03:55.340]   Speaking of BOS.
[01:03:55.340 --> 01:03:56.540]   Yeah.
[01:03:56.540 --> 01:03:57.900]   You can't--
[01:03:57.900 --> 01:04:00.460]   It feels like we always are talking about BOS for reasons.
[01:04:00.460 --> 01:04:00.900]   I don't know.
[01:04:00.900 --> 01:04:01.940]   BOS on a watch.
[01:04:01.940 --> 01:04:02.340]   On a watch.
[01:04:02.340 --> 01:04:03.700]   That's it.
[01:04:03.700 --> 01:04:04.820]   WebOS.
[01:04:04.820 --> 01:04:07.420]   It was WebOS, but BOS would be even better.
[01:04:07.420 --> 01:04:08.420]   I'm just saying.
[01:04:08.420 --> 01:04:08.900]   BOS is actually working range.
[01:04:08.900 --> 01:04:10.140]   Amiga workbench on a watch.
[01:04:10.140 --> 01:04:12.620]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:04:12.620 --> 01:04:13.860]   I'm fascinated now.
[01:04:13.860 --> 01:04:17.460]   I'm going to do some research into Post-Script.
[01:04:17.460 --> 01:04:18.220]   Yeah.
[01:04:18.220 --> 01:04:21.860]   It's interesting because we got an Epson Acculaser, I don't like,
[01:04:21.860 --> 01:04:23.260]   10 years ago, something like that.
[01:04:23.260 --> 01:04:28.060]   I mean, our last laser writer select 620 or whatever it was,
[01:04:28.060 --> 01:04:28.780]   fine, or 360.
[01:04:28.780 --> 01:04:29.620]   I forgot what number I was.
[01:04:29.620 --> 01:04:31.620]   Finally, it became too hard to keep it
[01:04:31.620 --> 01:04:34.700]   on the network via local talk bridges.
[01:04:34.700 --> 01:04:38.540]   And so finally got rid of that and got an Epson Acculaser.
[01:04:38.540 --> 01:04:42.460]   But that's Post-Script, but I just don't know what happened
[01:04:42.460 --> 01:04:44.100]   after that.
[01:04:44.100 --> 01:04:47.300]   I've completely lost track of the entire technology.
[01:04:47.300 --> 01:04:51.220]   And the printer keeps working, so I can't justify replacing it.
[01:04:51.220 --> 01:04:52.740]   Right.
[01:04:52.740 --> 01:04:55.580]   I think, so Post-Script for people who--
[01:04:55.580 --> 01:04:56.860]   what was Post-Script?
[01:04:56.860 --> 01:05:02.980]   It's basically a programming language of vector graphics.
[01:05:02.980 --> 01:05:04.380]   And basically everything.
[01:05:04.380 --> 01:05:07.420]   So I mean, that's where we got the entire concept of fonts
[01:05:07.420 --> 01:05:09.300]   as algorithms.
[01:05:09.300 --> 01:05:13.660]   TrueType was because Apple couldn't license Post-Script for fonts,
[01:05:13.660 --> 01:05:15.340]   so they did the TrueType fonts.
[01:05:15.340 --> 01:05:16.340]   Apple and One2.
[01:05:16.340 --> 01:05:18.340]   And Microsoft, right.
[01:05:18.340 --> 01:05:22.220]   I'm just looking through the Wikipedia article to see.
[01:05:22.220 --> 01:05:25.220]   Tell us, please, what's happened to Post-Script in the last 10
[01:05:25.220 --> 01:05:26.380]   years?
[01:05:26.380 --> 01:05:30.140]   Here's a hello world in Post-Script.
[01:05:30.140 --> 01:05:31.420]   Yeah.
[01:05:31.420 --> 01:05:32.820]   I wonder if they--
[01:05:32.820 --> 01:05:34.020]   It was kind of a--
[01:05:34.020 --> 01:05:35.700]   there was a guy by the name of Don Lancaster who
[01:05:35.700 --> 01:05:38.540]   was the first real pied piper of Post-Script.
[01:05:38.540 --> 01:05:41.340]   And he would publish these Post-Script programs
[01:05:41.340 --> 01:05:43.660]   that would cause your printer to eject
[01:05:43.660 --> 01:05:47.500]   a beautiful piece of vector line artwork.
[01:05:47.500 --> 01:05:50.100]   Because Adobe Illustrator was not available back then,
[01:05:50.100 --> 01:05:54.540]   it was like, holy mother of God, what magic has just happened.
[01:05:54.540 --> 01:05:58.380]   A 300 DPI picture of a cat swinging a baseball bat.
[01:05:58.380 --> 01:06:00.180]   I just want to point out that you can still
[01:06:00.180 --> 01:06:03.660]   find Don Lancaster's Guru's Lair Post-Script library online.
[01:06:03.660 --> 01:06:04.620]   That's a hot quest.
[01:06:04.620 --> 01:06:08.620]   It has not been updated since 1995, I think.
[01:06:08.620 --> 01:06:09.980]   Look at the layout.
[01:06:09.980 --> 01:06:13.140]   It's a good thing to worry through why you're going through
[01:06:13.140 --> 01:06:15.460]   your attack international industries catalog.
[01:06:15.460 --> 01:06:16.940]   Yes, that's--
[01:06:16.940 --> 01:06:17.940]   We had a--
[01:06:17.940 --> 01:06:19.420]   A Kaplan for the win.
[01:06:19.420 --> 01:06:22.460]   We had David Gelfman on debug a couple of years ago.
[01:06:22.460 --> 01:06:25.740]   And he talked all the way through Adobe to display Post-Script
[01:06:25.740 --> 01:06:26.940]   to cups to air prints.
[01:06:26.940 --> 01:06:27.860]   And it was fascinating.
[01:06:27.860 --> 01:06:28.020]   Wow.
[01:06:28.020 --> 01:06:30.060]   So you have covered this?
[01:06:30.060 --> 01:06:33.020]   Yeah, it will be Apple facing assholes of it.
[01:06:33.020 --> 01:06:33.580]   Wow.
[01:06:33.580 --> 01:06:36.820]   But it was fascinating.
[01:06:36.820 --> 01:06:39.260]   But this is like learning--
[01:06:39.260 --> 01:06:39.620]   I don't know.
[01:06:39.620 --> 01:06:42.020]   It's just La Tech or something.
[01:06:42.020 --> 01:06:45.460]   It's-- we don't need it anymore, thank God.
[01:06:45.460 --> 01:06:46.460]   It was also a little like--
[01:06:46.460 --> 01:06:48.100]   I mean, particularly Don Lancaster stuff
[01:06:48.100 --> 01:06:50.620]   was a little bit like those old--
[01:06:50.620 --> 01:06:51.700]   the mainframe things, right?
[01:06:51.700 --> 01:06:53.060]   You'd run this little program and it
[01:06:53.060 --> 01:06:57.500]   would spit a picture of the moon landing to your line printer.
[01:06:57.500 --> 01:07:00.140]   It was definitely a sort of thing.
[01:07:00.140 --> 01:07:02.900]   You'd have to be Eddie Diesen or Eddie Diesen type
[01:07:02.900 --> 01:07:04.060]   in order to get into this.
[01:07:04.060 --> 01:07:07.980]   It was a 1K file that generated a 300 DPI image
[01:07:07.980 --> 01:07:08.660]   of the moon landing.
[01:07:08.660 --> 01:07:10.140]   It's amazing.
[01:07:10.140 --> 01:07:13.180]   So this is an Apple page.
[01:07:13.180 --> 01:07:16.620]   And I'm wondering, Adam, could you
[01:07:16.620 --> 01:07:19.060]   put firmware password protection?
[01:07:19.060 --> 01:07:21.660]   Apparently, according to Tramel Hudson, does not help.
[01:07:21.660 --> 01:07:22.820]   Does not help.
[01:07:22.820 --> 01:07:24.540]   It goes-- it's below that.
[01:07:24.540 --> 01:07:26.020]   Good Lord.
[01:07:26.020 --> 01:07:27.180]   Yeah.
[01:07:27.180 --> 01:07:29.940]   This guy-- I mean, I don't know him.
[01:07:29.940 --> 01:07:32.020]   I've just been sort of reading about him a little bit.
[01:07:32.020 --> 01:07:34.940]   He's like a tech guy at a hedge fund.
[01:07:34.940 --> 01:07:37.940]   He does this stuff on his spare time.
[01:07:37.940 --> 01:07:38.860]   And he's good.
[01:07:38.860 --> 01:07:41.580]   He's found some other fairly high profile vulnerabilities.
[01:07:41.580 --> 01:07:44.140]   Some sort of gainful employee.
[01:07:44.140 --> 01:07:45.220]   Yeah, that's just it.
[01:07:45.220 --> 01:07:46.780]   Is that he's got this day job.
[01:07:46.780 --> 01:07:48.500]   And apparently, they're totally cool with him
[01:07:48.500 --> 01:07:50.540]   doing whatever he wants.
[01:07:50.540 --> 01:07:54.340]   Speaking of money, lots of it.
[01:07:54.340 --> 01:07:59.380]   The app ecosystem is really a rich ecosystem.
[01:07:59.380 --> 01:08:06.180]   Apple says that it paid $15 billion last year to app developers
[01:08:06.180 --> 01:08:09.300]   and, of course, got there $4.5 billion out of that.
[01:08:09.300 --> 01:08:11.900]   That's nothing for Apple, but it's a lot for app developers.
[01:08:11.900 --> 01:08:13.660]   How much of those were your Simpsons donuts, Leo?
[01:08:13.660 --> 01:08:15.820]   How much of those were your Simpsons donuts?
[01:08:15.820 --> 01:08:18.380]   And how much went to each app developer?
[01:08:18.380 --> 01:08:19.020]   So, you know, like--
[01:08:19.020 --> 01:08:23.500]   Well, Apple is always so proud to reveal the number.
[01:08:23.500 --> 01:08:26.140]   They're never proud to say, well, let's see a chart of how
[01:08:26.140 --> 01:08:27.860]   many of these are game in app purchases
[01:08:27.860 --> 01:08:29.780]   and how many of these are individual apps.
[01:08:29.780 --> 01:08:32.340]   And of course, it's probably the top 10 developers
[01:08:32.340 --> 01:08:34.660]   who get 90% of the money.
[01:08:34.660 --> 01:08:35.160]   Yeah.
[01:08:35.160 --> 01:08:36.160]   I'd love to see that.
[01:08:36.160 --> 01:08:36.660]   Sorry.
[01:08:36.660 --> 01:08:37.980]   It's all in Candy Crush saga.
[01:08:37.980 --> 01:08:39.660]   I'm not even sure it's 10.
[01:08:39.660 --> 01:08:40.160]   Really?
[01:08:40.160 --> 01:08:41.080]   Yeah.
[01:08:41.080 --> 01:08:42.060]   Well, you got to figure--
[01:08:42.060 --> 01:08:42.660]   I would put money closer to five.
[01:08:42.660 --> 01:08:45.180]   Clash of Clans, Candy Crush--
[01:08:45.180 --> 01:08:46.180]   EA.
[01:08:46.180 --> 01:08:48.780]   EA, because they do that donuts thing.
[01:08:48.780 --> 01:08:50.860]   And yeah.
[01:08:50.860 --> 01:08:54.940]   Yeah, I'm curious how much of it is first sale money
[01:08:54.940 --> 01:08:56.780]   and how much of it is in app purchase?
[01:08:56.780 --> 01:08:59.940]   If Google and Microsoft really want to bring Apple down,
[01:08:59.940 --> 01:09:03.500]   all they have to do is set financial investigators
[01:09:03.500 --> 01:09:05.640]   on their case to get the number of, here's
[01:09:05.640 --> 01:09:09.160]   how much money Apple paid to the Kardashians last quarter.
[01:09:09.160 --> 01:09:10.160]   I don't know if Google never--
[01:09:10.160 --> 01:09:12.280]   Never in a different cover from that disclosure.
[01:09:12.280 --> 01:09:14.280]   I don't think Google Play is any different, though.
[01:09:14.280 --> 01:09:16.280]   I think the people make the most money there.
[01:09:16.280 --> 01:09:16.800]   That's fine.
[01:09:16.800 --> 01:09:18.440]   Then let Apple investigate them back.
[01:09:18.440 --> 01:09:20.540]   Any time we get to do the break the Kardashian
[01:09:20.540 --> 01:09:23.720]   hegemony over in app purchases.
[01:09:23.720 --> 01:09:29.360]   Didn't they say-- I want to say, yeah, the iOS ecosystem
[01:09:29.360 --> 01:09:34.360]   all told has created more than half a million jobs.
[01:09:34.360 --> 01:09:35.560]   Apple, what up, when you cite--
[01:09:35.560 --> 01:09:36.760]   Well, the update they cite about--
[01:09:36.760 --> 01:09:38.720]   Citation needed.
[01:09:38.720 --> 01:09:39.720]   Well, I'm going to--
[01:09:39.720 --> 01:09:41.560]   It comes from the Apple press release.
[01:09:41.560 --> 01:09:42.560]   That's a citation.
[01:09:42.560 --> 01:09:44.520]   There's a whole site that Apple--
[01:09:44.520 --> 01:09:47.800]   I'm going to need to see their math on it.
[01:09:47.800 --> 01:09:49.720]   What counts as a job, exactly?
[01:09:49.720 --> 01:09:50.680]   It counts as a--
[01:09:50.680 --> 01:09:51.680]   Because the--
[01:09:51.680 --> 01:09:52.880]   There should be a link there that goes to Apple sites.
[01:09:52.880 --> 01:09:54.760]   --making a million and making millions of dollars
[01:09:54.760 --> 01:09:56.920]   can now afford to buy a third and fourth boat.
[01:09:56.920 --> 01:09:58.680]   And those boats need crews.
[01:09:58.680 --> 01:10:01.080]   And they need people to wash the boat.
[01:10:01.080 --> 01:10:02.240]   Well, they have a whole page.
[01:10:02.240 --> 01:10:03.800]   You think they're going to raise their own kids?
[01:10:03.800 --> 01:10:04.880]   That's another eight jobs.
[01:10:04.880 --> 01:10:07.760]   Apple.com/about/job-creation.
[01:10:07.760 --> 01:10:09.600]   They have a whole page.
[01:10:09.600 --> 01:10:12.640]   Over the years, Apple has driven incredible job growth
[01:10:12.640 --> 01:10:15.040]   and created entirely new industries.
[01:10:15.040 --> 01:10:17.040]   In fact, our products and innovations
[01:10:17.040 --> 01:10:21.400]   have led to over 1 million US jobs from our engineers--
[01:10:21.400 --> 01:10:24.520]   1 million-- 1 million-- I have the hair for it.
[01:10:24.520 --> 01:10:27.640]   1 million jobs from engineers and retailer employers
[01:10:27.640 --> 01:10:30.800]   to suppliers, manufacturers, and app development.
[01:10:30.800 --> 01:10:35.680]   And these are 1 million US jobs, 620,000
[01:10:35.680 --> 01:10:41.600]   to the iOS ecosystem, 334,000 jobs at other companies
[01:10:41.600 --> 01:10:45.720]   resulting from Apple spending and growth in 66,000 actual Apple
[01:10:45.720 --> 01:10:47.000]   employees.
[01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:49.920]   380,000 members of the Apple Developer Program
[01:10:49.920 --> 01:10:52.240]   have paid $99 each.
[01:10:52.240 --> 01:10:53.040]   That's good money.
[01:10:53.040 --> 01:10:54.520]   Yeah.
[01:10:54.520 --> 01:10:57.280]   A app store income earned by US developers,
[01:10:57.280 --> 01:10:59.960]   8 billion plus 78% of companies making apps
[01:10:59.960 --> 01:11:03.600]   are located outside Silicon Valley.
[01:11:03.600 --> 01:11:05.800]   It's interesting.
[01:11:05.800 --> 01:11:09.240]   It's interesting that Apple has made this page.
[01:11:09.240 --> 01:11:11.320]   I mean, if you think they did it a couple of years ago
[01:11:11.320 --> 01:11:13.040]   when they were being pushed about bringing jobs back
[01:11:13.040 --> 01:11:13.880]   to America--
[01:11:13.880 --> 01:11:14.380]   Right.
[01:11:14.380 --> 01:11:16.320]   --and they showed that, yes, through factories
[01:11:16.320 --> 01:11:18.920]   that are in America like the Back Bandit was a gorilla
[01:11:18.920 --> 01:11:19.720]   glass on the--
[01:11:19.720 --> 01:11:21.440]   Yeah, it was not just factory.
[01:11:21.440 --> 01:11:22.520]   I mean, yeah.
[01:11:22.520 --> 01:11:24.280]   They were trying to show that the human--
[01:11:24.280 --> 01:11:24.760]   Yeah.
[01:11:24.760 --> 01:11:26.280]   --were the developer economy.
[01:11:26.280 --> 01:11:29.120]   And I have to say, I think it's probably the case.
[01:11:29.120 --> 01:11:31.640]   We know a lot of people coming out of college who say,
[01:11:31.640 --> 01:11:33.360]   I'm going to do apps.
[01:11:33.360 --> 01:11:35.000]   And I might even start my own business.
[01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:37.040]   I might not even go somewhere to do apps.
[01:11:37.040 --> 01:11:38.600]   So low, mow, mow, mow, so.
[01:11:38.600 --> 01:11:39.080]   Yeah.
[01:11:39.080 --> 01:11:40.080]   What?
[01:11:40.080 --> 01:11:42.680]   So social, local, mobile, mobile, mobile, mobile.
[01:11:42.680 --> 01:11:43.360]   What?
[01:11:43.360 --> 01:11:44.920]   Are you speaking English there?
[01:11:44.920 --> 01:11:46.080]   Is that a Quebecois?
[01:11:46.080 --> 01:11:46.440]   Silicon Valley.
[01:11:46.440 --> 01:11:48.080]   No, Silicon Valley.
[01:11:48.080 --> 01:11:49.240]   Oh, yeah, right.
[01:11:49.240 --> 01:11:52.440]   Which is coming back, I'm happy to say.
[01:11:52.440 --> 01:11:58.280]   The new Cupertino campus created 41,100 jobs.
[01:11:58.280 --> 01:12:00.480]   And that's just building the Mario Kart track underneath.
[01:12:00.480 --> 01:12:01.520]   That's just the Mario Kart.
[01:12:01.520 --> 01:12:03.400]   That's just to cover up all the environmental impact
[01:12:03.400 --> 01:12:05.000]   coverups.
[01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:08.600]   12,600 full-time construction jobs for three years.
[01:12:08.600 --> 01:12:09.760]   They should have a linear--
[01:12:09.760 --> 01:12:11.720]   a synchrotron under that.
[01:12:11.720 --> 01:12:14.760]   Oh, there's so much they could do with that circle.
[01:12:14.760 --> 01:12:16.080]   If you look at-- and we showed it,
[01:12:16.080 --> 01:12:18.600]   we showed it last week, the drone footage of this.
[01:12:18.600 --> 01:12:19.880]   The circle is there.
[01:12:19.880 --> 01:12:20.880]   I mean, it really is there.
[01:12:20.880 --> 01:12:22.320]   You could see it being built.
[01:12:22.320 --> 01:12:26.720]   Apple data centers, US-based customer support,
[01:12:26.720 --> 01:12:31.360]   19,000 AppleCare jobs, 8,000 home-based AppleCare
[01:12:31.360 --> 01:12:35.560]   advisors, 28 call centers in 18 states.
[01:12:35.560 --> 01:12:36.400]   Wow.
[01:12:36.400 --> 01:12:39.520]   So what they're saying is that their software is really,
[01:12:39.520 --> 01:12:42.400]   really faulty and needs a lot of people to walk through it.
[01:12:42.400 --> 01:12:45.480]   Andy and I, you've always been an Apple hater.
[01:12:45.480 --> 01:12:46.840]   I'm just trolling.
[01:12:46.840 --> 01:12:47.600]   I'm sorry.
[01:12:47.600 --> 01:12:48.600]   I'm just--
[01:12:48.600 --> 01:12:49.760]   It's just in the lul--
[01:12:49.760 --> 01:12:52.440]   It's like the classic Beatles song where Paul is saying
[01:12:52.440 --> 01:12:54.840]   the lyrics that are positive, and then John said things
[01:12:54.840 --> 01:12:55.840]   that are wily negative.
[01:12:55.840 --> 01:12:57.120]   Life is very short.
[01:12:57.120 --> 01:12:58.280]   It's so classic.
[01:12:58.280 --> 01:13:00.200]   And there's no time.
[01:13:00.200 --> 01:13:02.160]   It's getting better all the time.
[01:13:02.160 --> 01:13:04.760]   Life is short.
[01:13:04.760 --> 01:13:07.920]   You're going to die.
[01:13:07.920 --> 01:13:10.440]   And so this is Christmas.
[01:13:10.440 --> 01:13:12.800]   What have you done?
[01:13:12.800 --> 01:13:16.040]   I am glad I'm still reading that into the tune of Apple,
[01:13:16.040 --> 01:13:17.000]   the Beatles history.
[01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:18.080]   This is so great.
[01:13:18.080 --> 01:13:20.920]   I just got to finally get to the end of it about sometime
[01:13:20.920 --> 01:13:22.920]   in mid-December, because I had to do it with John.
[01:13:22.920 --> 01:13:23.520]   So it's such a big deal.
[01:13:23.520 --> 01:13:24.000]   Oh, yes.
[01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:25.000]   So it was like--
[01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:26.920]   And also it's like, oh, when's the next one coming out?
[01:13:26.920 --> 01:13:28.440]   I want to find out what happens to these local--
[01:13:28.440 --> 01:13:28.800]   Yeah.
[01:13:28.800 --> 01:13:30.440]   Are they going to make it?
[01:13:30.440 --> 01:13:33.240]   Are they going to the top of the pops, Johnny?
[01:13:33.240 --> 01:13:37.880]   You know, I hope that John Lennon finally finds his female soul
[01:13:37.880 --> 01:13:42.680]   mate, because I really think that's what would create a dynasty.
[01:13:42.680 --> 01:13:45.200]   I'm at the point where they've signed their first autographs
[01:13:45.200 --> 01:13:47.080]   on a tour of Scotland.
[01:13:47.080 --> 01:13:50.840]   In fact, they signed these autographs
[01:13:50.840 --> 01:13:54.160]   because the van they were touring in had a horrific crash,
[01:13:54.160 --> 01:13:56.040]   severely injuring their drummer.
[01:13:56.040 --> 01:13:59.400]   And a bunch of girls noticed that the van was like an entertainment
[01:13:59.400 --> 01:14:03.800]   and come running out of their little Scottish hovels and go,
[01:14:03.800 --> 01:14:05.640]   are you-- are you entertainers?
[01:14:05.640 --> 01:14:07.760]   Yes, I am.
[01:14:07.760 --> 01:14:10.600]   And Paul McCartney was not using the name Paul McCartney.
[01:14:10.600 --> 01:14:14.560]   He was using the C-sign Paul Ramon.
[01:14:14.560 --> 01:14:16.160]   Oh, that's where the Ramon's come from.
[01:14:16.160 --> 01:14:18.480]   And then he learned a fourth chord.
[01:14:18.480 --> 01:14:20.440]   He was not allowed to call himself Ramon.
[01:14:20.440 --> 01:14:21.920]   It couldn't be Ramon anymore.
[01:14:21.920 --> 01:14:25.080]   Isn't that weird?
[01:14:25.080 --> 01:14:28.920]   All right, I don't know where we fell off the track here.
[01:14:28.920 --> 01:14:34.320]   Apple maintains max sales in a momentum in holiday quarter.
[01:14:34.320 --> 01:14:35.000]   Projection.
[01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:36.440]   Projection.
[01:14:36.440 --> 01:14:37.480]   This is Gartner Group.
[01:14:37.480 --> 01:14:39.760]   We take these all with a grain of salt.
[01:14:39.760 --> 01:14:42.280]   Apple shipped according to Gartner
[01:14:42.280 --> 01:14:48.080]   and they estimated 2.1 million max in Q4 up from 1.9 million in Q3.
[01:14:48.080 --> 01:14:53.840]   I'm sorry, Q4 last year marking an 11% increase.
[01:14:53.840 --> 01:14:56.160]   So here's the question I have about these numbers.
[01:14:56.160 --> 01:14:59.320]   Every time Apple gets on stage and talks about their numbers,
[01:14:59.320 --> 01:15:03.360]   they talk about how the industry as a whole dropped by 6%,
[01:15:03.360 --> 01:15:06.840]   but Apple's going up by 20%.
[01:15:06.840 --> 01:15:09.600]   I didn't have time to look up all the specifics,
[01:15:09.600 --> 01:15:12.160]   but these numbers don't quite jive with what Apple tells us
[01:15:12.160 --> 01:15:12.720]   to do that.
[01:15:12.720 --> 01:15:17.360]   Well, there's numbers and there's numbers.
[01:15:17.360 --> 01:15:19.360]   There's lies, damned lies.
[01:15:19.360 --> 01:15:21.920]   Overall, according to Gartner, PC shipments
[01:15:21.920 --> 01:15:26.520]   18 million units in Q4, that's an increase of 13%.
[01:15:26.520 --> 01:15:29.480]   Actually, I think that the PC market was dying
[01:15:29.480 --> 01:15:32.600]   for the last couple of years and has kind of come back.
[01:15:32.600 --> 01:15:35.120]   It's coming back or it's doing that surge that happens
[01:15:35.120 --> 01:15:37.920]   before you really die.
[01:15:37.920 --> 01:15:41.120]   Where you take that last breath and you twitch a little bit
[01:15:41.120 --> 01:15:42.840]   and then they go.
[01:15:42.840 --> 01:15:43.840]   But then they go.
[01:15:43.840 --> 01:15:46.160]   It does look like it's a renaissance because he's
[01:15:46.160 --> 01:15:49.120]   getting smaller, thinner, lighter, longer battery life.
[01:15:49.120 --> 01:15:51.040]   So everything that we liked about tablets
[01:15:51.040 --> 01:15:52.280]   is now becoming part of the industry.
[01:15:52.280 --> 01:15:56.560]   This is kind of an interesting-- this is Apple US market share.
[01:15:56.560 --> 01:15:58.880]   And of course, most of us come from the dim dark days
[01:15:58.880 --> 01:16:02.520]   when it was in the single digits, 3%, 4%.
[01:16:02.520 --> 01:16:04.040]   And even though it goes up and down,
[01:16:04.040 --> 01:16:08.880]   it has been trending up now about 11% of the 11.5,
[01:16:08.880 --> 01:16:13.400]   11.9, something like that, of the overall computer market.
[01:16:13.400 --> 01:16:15.240]   That's pretty good.
[01:16:15.240 --> 01:16:17.440]   A lot of Alex Lindsey buying Mac minis and 9 Macs.
[01:16:17.440 --> 01:16:17.880]   Yeah.
[01:16:17.880 --> 01:16:20.920]   Well, that's a big jump from those--
[01:16:20.920 --> 01:16:23.680]   Especially as some of us have--
[01:16:23.680 --> 01:16:26.440]   it's a little bit difficult to maintain the faith.
[01:16:26.440 --> 01:16:28.160]   As you see those pie charts of how much money
[01:16:28.160 --> 01:16:30.640]   Apple makes from things that are not related to the Mac.
[01:16:30.640 --> 01:16:32.160]   To whether, oh, maybe Apple's going to either just
[01:16:32.160 --> 01:16:34.480]   continue the Mac or make it more like an iOS device.
[01:16:34.480 --> 01:16:36.080]   So it's really great to see a line like that
[01:16:36.080 --> 01:16:39.400]   that indicates that it's a growth product for them
[01:16:39.400 --> 01:16:41.400]   and will continue to be an independent--
[01:16:41.400 --> 01:16:44.320]   free and independent nation.
[01:16:44.320 --> 01:16:45.600]   By the way, we should celebrate.
[01:16:45.600 --> 01:16:51.880]   It was eight years ago Friday that Apple unveiled the iPhone.
[01:16:51.880 --> 01:16:52.880]   That's pretty exciting.
[01:16:52.880 --> 01:16:55.480]   Widescreen iPod is an internet communicator
[01:16:55.480 --> 01:16:57.400]   and it's a breakthrough-- the revolutionary mobile phone.
[01:16:57.400 --> 01:16:57.920]   Are we getting it yet?
[01:16:57.920 --> 01:16:59.000]   We should play that clip.
[01:16:59.000 --> 01:16:59.440]   I love that clip.
[01:16:59.440 --> 01:17:00.840]   Are we getting it yet?
[01:17:00.840 --> 01:17:01.760]   We play it all the time.
[01:17:01.760 --> 01:17:06.000]   But it is eight years ago that Steve Jobs gave probably--
[01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:08.160]   his best keynote.
[01:17:08.160 --> 01:17:10.560]   And certainly now that we've seen the behind the scenes
[01:17:10.560 --> 01:17:14.960]   of how tricky that was to get that prototype to stay alive.
[01:17:14.960 --> 01:17:17.200]   Yeah, we appreciate it even more.
[01:17:17.200 --> 01:17:22.000]   For context, I think it really had everything
[01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:25.720]   to do with the radios because I held one in my hand
[01:17:25.720 --> 01:17:27.760]   and used it like that afternoon.
[01:17:27.760 --> 01:17:30.040]   And it was perfectly stable except for the one app
[01:17:30.040 --> 01:17:31.800]   that was just a JPEG.
[01:17:31.800 --> 01:17:34.880]   But of course, Wi-Fi wasn't connected to Wi-Fi.
[01:17:34.880 --> 01:17:36.240]   It wasn't connected to the network.
[01:17:36.240 --> 01:17:38.680]   So I think the stability had to do with this radio system.
[01:17:38.680 --> 01:17:40.480]   Yeah, that's what the order of stuff you did too.
[01:17:40.480 --> 01:17:41.920]   Like if you did something after something else,
[01:17:41.920 --> 01:17:42.480]   it wasn't good.
[01:17:42.480 --> 01:17:44.360]   But if you did it before, something else, it was fine.
[01:17:44.360 --> 01:17:45.200]   Actually, I'm sorry.
[01:17:45.200 --> 01:17:47.960]   I might have to-- well, I question that too
[01:17:47.960 --> 01:17:49.880]   because they didn't walk me through anything.
[01:17:49.880 --> 01:17:52.760]   I literally told them there's a little banquet
[01:17:52.760 --> 01:17:54.080]   bank cat with a coffee.
[01:17:54.080 --> 01:17:57.200]   I literally told the person-- I'm not going to name--
[01:17:57.200 --> 01:18:00.280]   that just go over there, enjoy a snack.
[01:18:00.280 --> 01:18:02.040]   I want to play with this for five or 10 minutes.
[01:18:02.040 --> 01:18:03.720]   They didn't tell me not to do anything.
[01:18:03.720 --> 01:18:04.800]   They didn't tell me to stop anything.
[01:18:04.800 --> 01:18:07.160]   I'm not even-- as I try to remember,
[01:18:07.160 --> 01:18:09.560]   I remember using the web browser so it might have even
[01:18:09.560 --> 01:18:11.360]   been connected to Wi-Fi.
[01:18:11.360 --> 01:18:13.040]   Although, who's to say they didn't make sure
[01:18:13.040 --> 01:18:15.360]   that it wouldn't access certain content that it doesn't--
[01:18:15.360 --> 01:18:16.680]   that knows it can't hit.
[01:18:16.680 --> 01:18:19.360]   But I'm not saying I'm questioning that account.
[01:18:19.360 --> 01:18:22.760]   I'm saying that all I'm saying is that I hadn't experienced--
[01:18:22.760 --> 01:18:25.320]   I had a free play experience with it
[01:18:25.320 --> 01:18:27.360]   that lasted for a half hour to 45 minutes.
[01:18:27.360 --> 01:18:28.600]   And at no point did it crash.
[01:18:28.600 --> 01:18:31.560]   And at no point did they say, don't touch--
[01:18:31.560 --> 01:18:34.280]   I think it was the multitasking part where the music fades out.
[01:18:34.280 --> 01:18:35.640]   And then you go and take the phone call,
[01:18:35.640 --> 01:18:38.280]   and then you do the email and the web browser.
[01:18:38.280 --> 01:18:40.440]   And then come back to the phone call, come back to the music.
[01:18:40.440 --> 01:18:42.560]   And they wanted to make sure that that part got nailed
[01:18:42.560 --> 01:18:42.960]   on stage.
[01:18:42.960 --> 01:18:43.920]   What book is that?
[01:18:43.920 --> 01:18:48.440]   Is that in the Apple Google book dogfight?
[01:18:48.440 --> 01:18:49.360]   It's a great story.
[01:18:49.360 --> 01:18:51.240]   The New York Times repeated it.
[01:18:51.240 --> 01:18:54.200]   But it's a great story from one of the iPhone engineers
[01:18:54.200 --> 01:18:58.960]   about how they were taking a shot in the front row of Moscone
[01:18:58.960 --> 01:19:02.800]   Center every time Steve got through another part of the demo.
[01:19:02.800 --> 01:19:04.080]   Oh my god, he survived.
[01:19:04.080 --> 01:19:05.840]   Oh, it was still anybody who was there.
[01:19:05.840 --> 01:19:07.240]   He was golden past.
[01:19:07.240 --> 01:19:10.360]   It was one of the greatest live shows I've ever seen in my life.
[01:19:10.360 --> 01:19:14.320]   Let's just watch a little bit of the magic of Steve Jobs.
[01:19:14.320 --> 01:19:17.320]   Is a widescreen iPod with touch controls?
[01:19:17.320 --> 01:19:20.280]   [CHEERING]
[01:19:20.280 --> 01:19:23.000]   I remember sitting next to Scott Born and Alex Lindsey
[01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:24.120]   during this.
[01:19:24.120 --> 01:19:26.400]   Scott was so excited.
[01:19:26.400 --> 01:19:27.840]   So this is their announcement.
[01:19:27.840 --> 01:19:32.400]   The second is a revolutionary multiply.
[01:19:32.400 --> 01:19:33.560]   He says, we're announcing three things.
[01:19:33.560 --> 01:19:35.800]   Now, everybody's thrilled because we heard
[01:19:35.800 --> 01:19:37.680]   and think we were all expecting a phone.
[01:19:37.680 --> 01:19:41.240]   So a wides touch screen iPod, a mobile phone,
[01:19:41.240 --> 01:19:42.520]   three new products from Apple.
[01:19:42.520 --> 01:19:47.720]   And the third is a breakthrough internet communications
[01:19:47.720 --> 01:19:49.560]   device.
[01:19:49.560 --> 01:19:51.640]   The audience is puzzled by that one.
[01:19:51.640 --> 01:19:52.880]   What?
[01:19:52.880 --> 01:19:54.680]   Go back to the phone.
[01:19:54.680 --> 01:19:56.280]   These things.
[01:19:56.280 --> 01:19:59.040]   A widescreen iPod with touch controls,
[01:19:59.040 --> 01:20:02.560]   a revolutionary mobile phone, and a breakthrough
[01:20:02.560 --> 01:20:06.480]   internet communications device.
[01:20:06.480 --> 01:20:13.040]   An iPod, a phone, and an internet communications
[01:20:13.040 --> 01:20:14.600]   I'm getting chills this watch.
[01:20:14.600 --> 01:20:17.280]   An iPod, a phone.
[01:20:17.280 --> 01:20:20.200]   [CHEERING]
[01:20:20.200 --> 01:20:21.080]   Are you getting it?
[01:20:21.080 --> 01:20:21.580]   Yeah.
[01:20:21.580 --> 01:20:28.920]   These are not three separate devices.
[01:20:28.920 --> 01:20:30.280]   This is one device.
[01:20:30.280 --> 01:20:32.280]   [CHEERING]
[01:20:32.280 --> 01:20:34.280]   By the way, that's not just Apple employees
[01:20:34.280 --> 01:20:35.280]   sharing at that point.
[01:20:35.280 --> 01:20:40.200]   And we are calling it iPhone.
[01:20:40.200 --> 01:20:46.520]   Today, Apple is going to reinvent the phone.
[01:20:46.520 --> 01:20:48.200]   And it did.
[01:20:48.200 --> 01:20:51.600]   Reinvented the computer January 9, 2007.
[01:20:51.600 --> 01:20:53.680]   And one little joke slide in there.
[01:20:53.680 --> 01:20:54.920]   There's an iPod with a dial.
[01:20:54.920 --> 01:21:00.320]   Actually, here it is, but we're going to leave it there.
[01:21:00.320 --> 01:21:02.000]   Oh, he's got it in his pocket.
[01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:03.600]   He jobs at the height of his powers.
[01:21:03.600 --> 01:21:06.000]   There was-- this was really--
[01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:08.480]   no one has ever since, no one before,
[01:21:08.480 --> 01:21:09.960]   no one's since able to do that.
[01:21:09.960 --> 01:21:12.080]   I mean, just a showman.
[01:21:12.080 --> 01:21:14.000]   But a technology genius--
[01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:16.120]   I mean, really, it's amazing to watch him at the height--
[01:21:16.120 --> 01:21:17.520]   exactly at the height of his powers.
[01:21:17.520 --> 01:21:21.480]   Not only that, but being able to see the absolute glee
[01:21:21.480 --> 01:21:24.480]   on his face showing this off.
[01:21:24.480 --> 01:21:27.520]   You've seen a lot of different tech keynotes,
[01:21:27.520 --> 01:21:29.320]   some of them for really important products.
[01:21:29.320 --> 01:21:33.680]   You never see just the level of genuine excitement
[01:21:33.680 --> 01:21:35.320]   that I can't believe I finally get
[01:21:35.320 --> 01:21:37.120]   to show people this thing that I've
[01:21:37.120 --> 01:21:40.040]   been dying to show people for the past year and a half.
[01:21:40.040 --> 01:21:44.000]   And I would have get his shoes knowing now how risky
[01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:45.480]   this demo is going to be.
[01:21:45.480 --> 01:21:48.120]   I would have been a little nervous, but he wasn't.
[01:21:48.120 --> 01:21:49.440]   If I were Steve Jobs, I would know,
[01:21:49.440 --> 01:21:50.760]   I'm not going to get fired if this thing--
[01:21:50.760 --> 01:21:51.480]   Well, that's true.
[01:21:51.480 --> 01:21:54.840]   Somebody else will lose his job.
[01:21:54.840 --> 01:21:58.520]   By the way, Apple Suppliers announced record December
[01:21:58.520 --> 01:22:00.440]   revenues as iPhone sales source.
[01:22:00.440 --> 01:22:08.480]   So in fact, TechCrunch had a story that said the bigger iPhones
[01:22:08.480 --> 01:22:11.880]   are actually hurting Android sales a little bit.
[01:22:11.880 --> 01:22:14.080]   iPhone 6 and 6 Plus--
[01:22:14.080 --> 01:22:17.240]   Oh, so many people when I was using my iPhone 6 Plus at CES
[01:22:17.240 --> 01:22:19.160]   who came up to me and goes, oh, iPhone 6 Plus,
[01:22:19.160 --> 01:22:20.160]   I just switched to that.
[01:22:20.160 --> 01:22:20.680]   I loved it.
[01:22:20.680 --> 01:22:22.880]   I used to have a note, and I hated every minute of it.
[01:22:22.880 --> 01:22:24.320]   Now I'm using my iPhone.
[01:22:24.320 --> 01:22:26.440]   I got to say, I read that article.
[01:22:26.440 --> 01:22:29.600]   I don't think that they shared the information that
[01:22:29.600 --> 01:22:31.320]   justifies the headline.
[01:22:31.320 --> 01:22:34.280]   Android's market share dropped in most European markets
[01:22:34.280 --> 01:22:36.920]   and the US.
[01:22:36.920 --> 01:22:40.560]   Now this is July-- I'm sorry, January 7, 2015.
[01:22:40.560 --> 01:22:46.240]   This is from Kant R, which is a Kant R World Panel ComTech.
[01:22:46.240 --> 01:22:51.120]   I presume an analyst group at ComTech.
[01:22:51.120 --> 01:22:53.720]   Impact of iPhone 6 and 6 Plus launch continued in the run up
[01:22:53.720 --> 01:22:56.000]   to Christmas with iOS growing its market share
[01:22:56.000 --> 01:22:57.880]   in all surveyed countries except Japan.
[01:22:57.880 --> 01:23:04.960]   While remaining the dominant-- this is probably a key phrase.
[01:23:04.960 --> 01:23:07.120]   While remaining the dominant global OS,
[01:23:07.120 --> 01:23:09.560]   Android's market share dropped in most European countries
[01:23:09.560 --> 01:23:15.960]   and the US, that declined the first in September 2013.
[01:23:15.960 --> 01:23:17.120]   A decline in Android market share
[01:23:17.120 --> 01:23:18.560]   does not necessarily translate into bad news
[01:23:18.560 --> 01:23:20.960]   for all the ecosystems players, the choices of brands
[01:23:20.960 --> 01:23:23.720]   and device within the ecosystem and powers consumers
[01:23:23.720 --> 01:23:25.560]   to drive different fortunes for all players.
[01:23:25.560 --> 01:23:26.120]   Context.
[01:23:26.120 --> 01:23:27.440]   I mean, people have been waiting for a large screen
[01:23:27.440 --> 01:23:28.440]   iPhone for a long time.
[01:23:28.440 --> 01:23:30.240]   And it's not hard to assume that people who were waiting
[01:23:30.240 --> 01:23:32.000]   jumped on it and you see a surge in that.
[01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:33.800]   And then as it goes six months, nine months--
[01:23:33.800 --> 01:23:35.000]   And it's almost into the side.
[01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:38.440]   In Europe, for instance, Android is 70% of the market.
[01:23:38.440 --> 01:23:39.800]   Well, that's down 3%.
[01:23:39.800 --> 01:23:41.200]   In India, Windows Phone--
[01:23:41.200 --> 01:23:43.280]   Windows Phone is still huge.
[01:23:43.280 --> 01:23:44.720]   Blackberry's big in Sri Lanka too.
[01:23:44.720 --> 01:23:45.920]   That's where you go.
[01:23:45.920 --> 01:23:47.320]   Kind of speaking of Android.
[01:23:47.320 --> 01:23:51.320]   It's just the headline of reaching the conclusion that--
[01:23:51.320 --> 01:23:55.120]   It's a iPhone 6 is causing people to not buy Android phones
[01:23:55.120 --> 01:23:59.000]   as opposed to there was a huge corral of people who
[01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:00.720]   were crushing different phones.
[01:24:00.720 --> 01:24:04.040]   The article even says that that most of the time,
[01:24:04.040 --> 01:24:05.560]   it's not Android that's getting hurt.
[01:24:05.560 --> 01:24:08.520]   The most it's coming on other places.
[01:24:08.520 --> 01:24:11.320]   I have to say that--
[01:24:11.320 --> 01:24:14.000]   Much as I'm certainly glad that Apple
[01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:17.920]   introduced the 6+ and the 6+ after using the 6 since it came out.
[01:24:17.920 --> 01:24:20.560]   And give me my 5S form factor back.
[01:24:20.560 --> 01:24:22.120]   Oh, you don't like the bigger phone?
[01:24:22.120 --> 01:24:23.840]   It's just too big.
[01:24:23.840 --> 01:24:25.200]   It doesn't fit in my pocket.
[01:24:25.200 --> 01:24:28.480]   I hate the side-mounted power button.
[01:24:28.480 --> 01:24:30.320]   I have a 5S on my desk and I pick it up
[01:24:30.320 --> 01:24:31.840]   and I can't believe phones were ever that small.
[01:24:31.840 --> 01:24:33.560]   It's teeny-weeny.
[01:24:33.560 --> 01:24:35.200]   What is this teeny phone?
[01:24:35.200 --> 01:24:36.640]   See, I have a 6 inch--
[01:24:36.640 --> 01:24:38.120]   these are two 6-inch phones.
[01:24:38.120 --> 01:24:39.520]   And this is now the standard for me.
[01:24:39.520 --> 01:24:42.000]   So Adam, I think you're going upstream on this one.
[01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:42.480]   Look at that.
[01:24:42.480 --> 01:24:45.600]   Well, on the other hand, there's a lot of people
[01:24:45.600 --> 01:24:46.720]   who are--
[01:24:46.720 --> 01:24:50.320]   my wife also is fairly small, and she doesn't like it at all.
[01:24:50.320 --> 01:24:52.720]   I mean, she's like, this phone is just too big for me.
[01:24:52.720 --> 01:24:55.680]   I am just strange because you see giant Android phones being
[01:24:55.680 --> 01:24:58.040]   used by small people all the time.
[01:24:58.040 --> 01:24:58.920]   But you do like--
[01:24:58.920 --> 01:25:00.920]   I asked on Android Centralized that how many people
[01:25:00.920 --> 01:25:02.640]   won a 4-inch Android phone?
[01:25:02.640 --> 01:25:04.640]   Because I figured if everyone who owns an iPhone,
[01:25:04.640 --> 01:25:06.000]   if a bunch of people were lamenting
[01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:08.920]   the loss of smaller phones, that happened to Android a year
[01:25:08.920 --> 01:25:09.600]   or two ago.
[01:25:09.600 --> 01:25:11.640]   They started making-- I think the HTC Mini
[01:25:11.640 --> 01:25:13.400]   was twice the size of my iPhone.
[01:25:13.400 --> 01:25:14.520]   And they just said, no one cares.
[01:25:14.520 --> 01:25:15.640]   No one wants smaller phones.
[01:25:15.640 --> 01:25:18.560]   And they're used by tons of people of all shapes and sizes.
[01:25:18.560 --> 01:25:21.000]   It's really weird to see the difference in those two ecosystems.
[01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:23.920]   I think the mistake is calling it a phone.
[01:25:23.920 --> 01:25:27.320]   The phone is no longer the big part of this thing.
[01:25:27.320 --> 01:25:28.760]   Yeah, it's an app.
[01:25:28.760 --> 01:25:31.160]   It's an internet device.
[01:25:31.160 --> 01:25:33.640]   It's a wide screen icon.
[01:25:33.640 --> 01:25:36.280]   The phone is less than a third.
[01:25:36.280 --> 01:25:38.800]   It's one-tenth of the functionality of these devices now,
[01:25:38.800 --> 01:25:39.520]   right?
[01:25:39.520 --> 01:25:40.560]   It's an interesting question.
[01:25:40.560 --> 01:25:44.160]   I wonder if anyone's done actual time study,
[01:25:44.160 --> 01:25:46.880]   installed something that they can tell how much time
[01:25:46.880 --> 01:25:49.760]   the phone app is used versus the other kinds of apps.
[01:25:49.760 --> 01:25:52.000]   Messages and the most popular apps in the world.
[01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:53.760]   Yeah, messages make sense.
[01:25:53.760 --> 01:25:59.160]   I never use the phone 15, 20 times a month.
[01:25:59.160 --> 01:26:00.440]   Well, you're an upper New York state.
[01:26:00.440 --> 01:26:01.960]   That's--
[01:26:01.960 --> 01:26:03.520]   You'll get the phone any day now.
[01:26:03.520 --> 01:26:05.840]   Someday, you'll understand.
[01:26:05.840 --> 01:26:09.440]   It's mostly walkie-talkie up there, isn't there, from farm to farm.
[01:26:09.440 --> 01:26:10.600]   Am radio apps.
[01:26:10.600 --> 01:26:12.160]   I'll be on the road just saying that.
[01:26:12.160 --> 01:26:14.640]   We just tap into those wires that go by.
[01:26:14.640 --> 01:26:17.120]   You still have party lines up there, right?
[01:26:17.120 --> 01:26:18.520]   Hey, I grew up with a party line.
[01:26:18.520 --> 01:26:19.280]   Let's see what I'm saying.
[01:26:19.280 --> 01:26:20.280]   All right.
[01:26:20.280 --> 01:26:21.440]   In the EU--
[01:26:21.440 --> 01:26:24.280]   Climb, I ignore 5-1.
[01:26:24.280 --> 01:26:25.600]   I'm not making a prediction for the fall,
[01:26:25.600 --> 01:26:27.680]   but I wouldn't be surprised if Apple decided
[01:26:27.680 --> 01:26:30.040]   to make a compact phone.
[01:26:30.040 --> 01:26:31.480]   If Apple decided to--
[01:26:31.480 --> 01:26:34.720]   if realized, I think that it's not just a case of fashion.
[01:26:34.720 --> 01:26:36.240]   I think that a lot of people really
[01:26:36.240 --> 01:26:38.000]   feel like they're being left behind,
[01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:39.760]   because, again, if you have a smaller hand,
[01:26:39.760 --> 01:26:43.800]   and that's pretty much endemic to being a woman and not a man,
[01:26:43.800 --> 01:26:47.360]   it's not like you have the option now of choosing
[01:26:47.360 --> 01:26:48.320]   a smaller phone.
[01:26:48.320 --> 01:26:51.000]   Now you have the phone that's kind of too big,
[01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:52.880]   but you can deal with it to the phone that's--
[01:26:52.880 --> 01:26:54.760]   and the phone that's way, way too big,
[01:26:54.760 --> 01:26:57.360]   unless you want to go back to an iPhone 5C
[01:26:57.360 --> 01:26:59.760]   or a cheaper last year's model.
[01:26:59.760 --> 01:27:02.760]   So I think that I just feel like it would be a very Apple move
[01:27:02.760 --> 01:27:06.040]   to simply say that, because we have such robust software,
[01:27:06.040 --> 01:27:08.880]   and because we have the ability to tell our developers
[01:27:08.880 --> 01:27:12.000]   what to develop, we are going to also have our return
[01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:15.600]   to the old 4x3 form factor, the tiny, tiny, tiny phone.
[01:27:15.600 --> 01:27:17.560]   So the people don't feel as though they're
[01:27:17.560 --> 01:27:19.160]   being left behind by virtue of the fact
[01:27:19.160 --> 01:27:20.720]   that they have smaller hands.
[01:27:20.720 --> 01:27:23.040]   I mean, it's a situation in part when I sort of watch
[01:27:23.040 --> 01:27:27.640]   my wife working with it, that it doesn't fit in her pockets.
[01:27:27.640 --> 01:27:30.400]   If she goes running, she has a shorts pocket.
[01:27:30.400 --> 01:27:35.600]   She can't even fit the 5S in those pockets.
[01:27:35.600 --> 01:27:38.880]   The 4S was the last one that worked for her in those.
[01:27:38.880 --> 01:27:41.560]   So it's just frustrating.
[01:27:41.560 --> 01:27:44.000]   She has a bike bag that goes under her bike seat
[01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:45.160]   when she goes biking.
[01:27:45.160 --> 01:27:48.480]   Again, the 5S barely, barely fits.
[01:27:48.480 --> 01:27:49.920]   And she had to really cram that in.
[01:27:49.920 --> 01:27:51.480]   So the 6, no chance.
[01:27:51.480 --> 01:27:53.040]   It's just not going to--
[01:27:53.040 --> 01:27:55.480]   I just wonder what two people who use Android phones do.
[01:27:55.480 --> 01:27:57.040]   I mean, they just aren't small Android phones.
[01:27:57.040 --> 01:27:59.960]   They did it just over two years they got used to it.
[01:27:59.960 --> 01:28:01.520]   You can get them.
[01:28:01.520 --> 01:28:04.560]   Maybe you can't get them at your AT&T store.
[01:28:04.560 --> 01:28:05.640]   But they're--
[01:28:05.640 --> 01:28:07.640]   They're usually low end.
[01:28:07.640 --> 01:28:11.520]   Well, no, Samsung and HTC both make small--
[01:28:11.520 --> 01:28:14.520]   especially Samsung, the basic-- well, we have a three inch
[01:28:14.520 --> 01:28:17.240]   phone, we have a 3.25 inch phone, we have a metric,
[01:28:17.240 --> 01:28:20.040]   30 centimeter phone, we have a 33 centimeter phone.
[01:28:20.040 --> 01:28:21.880]   They have a very, very large product line.
[01:28:21.880 --> 01:28:23.480]   And at least it's out there, particularly
[01:28:23.480 --> 01:28:26.240]   if you're willing to buy an unlocked phone off contract.
[01:28:26.240 --> 01:28:27.640]   I wonder what that's one of those.
[01:28:27.640 --> 01:28:29.720]   The responsibility of Apple is that they
[01:28:29.720 --> 01:28:33.600]   are the only source of iOS compatible phones.
[01:28:33.600 --> 01:28:36.000]   So if they don't make it, you can't get it anywhere,
[01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:38.120]   which I think to their point of view would say,
[01:28:38.120 --> 01:28:39.760]   now we kind of have a responsibility
[01:28:39.760 --> 01:28:42.520]   to make sure that people who are physically different--
[01:28:42.520 --> 01:28:45.040]   and I'm not talking about smaller hands as a disability,
[01:28:45.040 --> 01:28:47.600]   but I'm talking about there are a range of people who use--
[01:28:47.600 --> 01:28:48.480]   It's the same--
[01:28:48.480 --> 01:28:48.880]   Oh, this is the same--
[01:28:48.880 --> 01:28:49.560]   Oh, this is the same--
[01:28:49.560 --> 01:28:50.160]   Let's face it.
[01:28:50.160 --> 01:28:51.200]   I mean, yeah.
[01:28:51.200 --> 01:28:51.720]   Oh, no.
[01:28:51.720 --> 01:28:53.440]   You can't palm a basketball either.
[01:28:53.440 --> 01:28:55.440]   But it's the same reason why Apple was that company that
[01:28:55.440 --> 01:28:58.080]   said, you know what, when we have human faces,
[01:28:58.080 --> 01:29:00.520]   there will all be either dark blue or light blue.
[01:29:00.520 --> 01:29:02.760]   We're not even going to get into the skin tone game
[01:29:02.760 --> 01:29:04.320]   because we don't want people to think
[01:29:04.320 --> 01:29:07.280]   that our representation of a user and a user icon
[01:29:07.280 --> 01:29:09.920]   is going to be someone of a specific skin tone.
[01:29:09.920 --> 01:29:10.840]   Didn't we kind of express--
[01:29:10.840 --> 01:29:13.000]   I feel like it's a very Apple move from the blue.
[01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:15.280]   Maybe we didn't excreate Samsung for doing this,
[01:29:15.280 --> 01:29:16.680]   but that's kind of what Samsung has done
[01:29:16.680 --> 01:29:19.040]   is they just kind of made every size possible.
[01:29:19.040 --> 01:29:20.680]   But that's always where they're done.
[01:29:20.680 --> 01:29:23.040]   And it's been quite successful.
[01:29:23.040 --> 01:29:25.840]   I don't think anybody, when they came up with the first Samsung
[01:29:25.840 --> 01:29:29.120]   Galaxy Note, I don't think anybody could have made a use
[01:29:29.120 --> 01:29:31.640]   case for a crazy stupid big phone.
[01:29:31.640 --> 01:29:33.960]   But when they said, we have the manufacturing capability,
[01:29:33.960 --> 01:29:35.600]   we will make a crazy stupid big phone.
[01:29:35.600 --> 01:29:37.400]   If it fails, we won't make it next year.
[01:29:37.400 --> 01:29:40.040]   And it's surprised the hell out of me
[01:29:40.040 --> 01:29:42.760]   as a professional analyst and it surprised the hell out
[01:29:42.760 --> 01:29:44.800]   of the industry that there are people who are actually
[01:29:44.800 --> 01:29:46.200]   really, really interested into it.
[01:29:46.200 --> 01:29:48.240]   So I just want to be screaming my computer.
[01:29:48.240 --> 01:29:50.720]   I think that I also think that is true of the Android phones
[01:29:50.720 --> 01:29:55.120]   is that my experience is that the people who buy Android phones
[01:29:55.120 --> 01:29:58.120]   a lot of the time are doing it more on price.
[01:29:58.120 --> 01:30:03.000]   And so they're not as involved with their phones
[01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:05.560]   as iPhone users usually are.
[01:30:05.560 --> 01:30:08.560]   And so they may be willing to compromise more.
[01:30:08.560 --> 01:30:10.480]   Oh, yeah, that's what they had at the store.
[01:30:10.480 --> 01:30:12.480]   It seemed fine, so I got it.
[01:30:12.480 --> 01:30:14.320]   Maybe they would be happier with a smaller phone,
[01:30:14.320 --> 01:30:17.160]   but that wasn't an easy option, so they didn't get it.
[01:30:17.160 --> 01:30:19.560]   You buy what you can get easily and then what's cheap.
[01:30:19.560 --> 01:30:20.080]   So that's what--
[01:30:20.080 --> 01:30:21.240]   I think globally, that's why--
[01:30:21.240 --> 01:30:22.800]   I think many is 4.3 inches.
[01:30:22.800 --> 01:30:26.080]   Yeah, I think globally, that's why Android does so well.
[01:30:26.080 --> 01:30:28.720]   But in the US, I'm not sure that's the case.
[01:30:28.720 --> 01:30:35.360]   Half of all phones, so Apple's got 47.4% of phone sales.
[01:30:35.360 --> 01:30:36.200]   The bigger challenge--
[01:30:36.200 --> 01:30:38.320]   The other half is Android, and for the most part,
[01:30:38.320 --> 01:30:40.360]   I mean, I would say very close.
[01:30:40.360 --> 01:30:42.960]   And I don't think all of them are buying it for price.
[01:30:42.960 --> 01:30:44.800]   I think a lot of them buy it for functionality.
[01:30:44.800 --> 01:30:45.160]   I buy it.
[01:30:45.160 --> 01:30:46.800]   I'm an Android user for functionality.
[01:30:46.800 --> 01:30:49.000]   The bigger challenge with these 12-day phone
[01:30:49.000 --> 01:30:50.080]   is how they're going to price it.
[01:30:50.080 --> 01:30:52.040]   So for example, the bigger phone is $100 more.
[01:30:52.040 --> 01:30:54.760]   The iPhone 6 Plus is $100 more than the regular iPhone.
[01:30:54.760 --> 01:30:56.720]   If they make a small one, it's $100 cheaper,
[01:30:56.720 --> 01:30:59.520]   then is it the same price as last year's model?
[01:30:59.520 --> 01:31:00.680]   Is that what they're doing?
[01:31:00.680 --> 01:31:01.520]   Yes.
[01:31:01.520 --> 01:31:04.400]   That's the first generation iPhone
[01:31:04.400 --> 01:31:07.400]   compared to the iPhone 6 Plus.
[01:31:07.400 --> 01:31:09.400]   And then you compare that to--
[01:31:09.400 --> 01:31:12.440]   here was the leading smartphone before the iPhone came out.
[01:31:12.440 --> 01:31:14.080]   Look at the size of that screen.
[01:31:14.080 --> 01:31:15.720]   What if they did a flip phone?
[01:31:15.720 --> 01:31:17.360]   What if Apple did a flip phone?
[01:31:17.360 --> 01:31:18.200]   Come on.
[01:31:18.200 --> 01:31:19.560]   That's what people want.
[01:31:19.560 --> 01:31:20.960]   No, it's interesting because Apple--
[01:31:20.960 --> 01:31:23.080]   it's easier to say Apple can make a smaller phone,
[01:31:23.080 --> 01:31:25.160]   but would it be a 6C then because they'd
[01:31:25.160 --> 01:31:27.240]   use the plastic as a way to say, yes, that's
[01:31:27.240 --> 01:31:28.320]   why it's $100 cheaper.
[01:31:28.320 --> 01:31:32.800]   Not just the size, but it's a less premium product.
[01:31:32.800 --> 01:31:34.480]   That could be-- and I guess what I'm saying
[01:31:34.480 --> 01:31:36.500]   is that a lot of the time when I'm seeing, again,
[01:31:36.500 --> 01:31:37.540]   this is upstate New York.
[01:31:37.540 --> 01:31:38.780]   I am not in Silicon Valley.
[01:31:38.780 --> 01:31:40.300]   I'm not in the city.
[01:31:40.300 --> 01:31:42.620]   And when I see people buy Android phones,
[01:31:42.620 --> 01:31:45.780]   a lot of the times I'm seeing it because they're cheaper.
[01:31:45.780 --> 01:31:48.720]   That is the simple fact this is not a rich area,
[01:31:48.720 --> 01:31:51.620]   and people are not interested in being the latest and greatest.
[01:31:51.620 --> 01:31:54.500]   They just need a phone, and that's what selling--
[01:31:54.500 --> 01:31:58.460]   That's an important thing to point out,
[01:31:58.460 --> 01:32:01.100]   because I'm one of those people who--
[01:32:01.100 --> 01:32:04.540]   mostly because of my job-- that when people are using phones,
[01:32:04.540 --> 01:32:07.140]   I'm really trying to sneak a look to see what kinds they're
[01:32:07.140 --> 01:32:07.900]   using.
[01:32:07.900 --> 01:32:10.500]   And if you go to-- there are certain places
[01:32:10.500 --> 01:32:11.700]   where you see nothing but iPhones,
[01:32:11.700 --> 01:32:14.220]   but if you go see-- if you're waiting for a bus,
[01:32:14.220 --> 01:32:16.140]   you will see a lot of Android's out there.
[01:32:16.140 --> 01:32:18.300]   If you go to a Chipotle, which is a place where
[01:32:18.300 --> 01:32:22.180]   lots and lots of people of all economics classes levels
[01:32:22.180 --> 01:32:25.740]   come, you will see a much wider variety of devices.
[01:32:25.740 --> 01:32:28.980]   If you go to-- again, I'm talking about the Cawty-Tawty
[01:32:28.980 --> 01:32:29.480]   places.
[01:32:29.480 --> 01:32:30.700]   If you go to a Panera Bread, you will
[01:32:30.700 --> 01:32:34.500]   see that most people are actually not using MacBooks.
[01:32:34.500 --> 01:32:35.380]   They're using Dell's.
[01:32:35.380 --> 01:32:36.660]   They're using A-SOSs.
[01:32:36.660 --> 01:32:38.380]   They're using Acer machines.
[01:32:38.380 --> 01:32:39.980]   And they're very, very happy with them.
[01:32:39.980 --> 01:32:40.620]   So it's--
[01:32:40.620 --> 01:32:41.660]   Probably self-selecting.
[01:32:41.660 --> 01:32:43.300]   If you go to Starbucks with an MacBook,
[01:32:43.300 --> 01:32:45.260]   you probably see other people who have gone to Starbucks
[01:32:45.260 --> 01:32:46.100]   for the next--
[01:32:46.100 --> 01:32:50.460]   If you're going to be shown fake not writing your screenplay,
[01:32:50.460 --> 01:32:52.180]   you may as well be fake not writing
[01:32:52.180 --> 01:32:54.060]   on the best laptop available.
[01:32:54.060 --> 01:32:54.980]   It was funny.
[01:32:54.980 --> 01:32:56.380]   Like, at CES, it went in on-core,
[01:32:56.380 --> 01:32:56.740]   but it's like that.
[01:32:56.740 --> 01:32:59.660]   I saw a lot more-- most of the years you see a wide variety.
[01:32:59.660 --> 01:33:02.500]   You see people with purple flip-black barry phones.
[01:33:02.500 --> 01:33:04.940]   And this year, especially just going around the hotel,
[01:33:04.940 --> 01:33:06.380]   I saw mostly iPhones.
[01:33:06.380 --> 01:33:07.180]   And I don't know if--
[01:33:07.180 --> 01:33:09.900]   And not even new ones, they were iPhone 5s and 5ss
[01:33:09.900 --> 01:33:10.500]   and things like that.
[01:33:10.500 --> 01:33:13.140]   OK, so just speaking of the iPhone 5,
[01:33:13.140 --> 01:33:15.060]   another one of the things that we were talking about
[01:33:15.060 --> 01:33:17.380]   in the pre-show stuff that Lynx was--
[01:33:17.380 --> 01:33:21.780]   the most popular camera on Flickr is still an iPhone 5.
[01:33:21.780 --> 01:33:22.280]   Yeah.
[01:33:22.280 --> 01:33:22.780]   Not the 5s.
[01:33:22.780 --> 01:33:23.780]   Not the 5s.
[01:33:23.780 --> 01:33:26.300]   But doesn't that include all previous postings?
[01:33:26.300 --> 01:33:27.340]   Or is it just for this year?
[01:33:27.340 --> 01:33:29.540]   I mean, I should look at that number.
[01:33:29.540 --> 01:33:30.820]   Is that all total?
[01:33:30.820 --> 01:33:31.740]   Because then it would make sense.
[01:33:31.740 --> 01:33:35.180]   That one was 2014 for 2014.
[01:33:35.180 --> 01:33:39.460]   And then it was actually the iPhone 5 was up from 2013
[01:33:39.460 --> 01:33:41.660]   for top mobile camera.
[01:33:41.660 --> 01:33:43.860]   And I just thought this was fascinating.
[01:33:43.860 --> 01:33:46.500]   I mean, because you normally expect, yeah, yeah,
[01:33:46.500 --> 01:33:48.980]   the old ones will drop off slowly,
[01:33:48.980 --> 01:33:50.380]   and the new ones will replace them.
[01:33:50.380 --> 01:33:52.580]   And I could see the iPhone 6 not being on this list
[01:33:52.580 --> 01:33:53.420]   because it came out off.
[01:33:53.420 --> 01:33:55.340]   I just think the 5s would be the dominant--
[01:33:55.340 --> 01:33:57.060]   But right, why not the 5s?
[01:33:57.060 --> 01:33:58.460]   Next year.
[01:33:58.460 --> 01:34:00.340]   And then so there's a one-year lag, maybe.
[01:34:00.340 --> 01:34:01.900]   Also, people tend to--
[01:34:01.900 --> 01:34:03.580]   I forget where I heard this, but people tend to hand down
[01:34:03.580 --> 01:34:04.380]   their iPhones a lot.
[01:34:04.380 --> 01:34:06.260]   Not many people get rid of them or put them in a drawer.
[01:34:06.260 --> 01:34:06.780]   That's true.
[01:34:06.780 --> 01:34:10.260]   And they probably propagate.
[01:34:10.260 --> 01:34:12.540]   I finally got rid of a 4s because everything
[01:34:12.540 --> 01:34:14.940]   later than the 4s ended up going to somebody.
[01:34:14.940 --> 01:34:16.660]   I mean, is Flickr a good barometer now?
[01:34:16.660 --> 01:34:18.540]   Or do we have to find out what the Snapchat numbers are?
[01:34:18.540 --> 01:34:19.540]   Really?
[01:34:19.540 --> 01:34:21.060]   Thanks for the photo usage.
[01:34:21.060 --> 01:34:21.700]   Let's take a break.
[01:34:21.700 --> 01:34:23.180]   Do you want to go still use Flickr?
[01:34:23.180 --> 01:34:24.140]   We've got a great panel.
[01:34:24.140 --> 01:34:25.940]   We've got Adam Anks from tidbits,
[01:34:25.940 --> 01:34:28.980]   the longest running internet Macintosh publication,
[01:34:28.980 --> 01:34:31.020]   which you must get if you're not already a member,
[01:34:31.020 --> 01:34:33.300]   tidbites.com.
[01:34:33.300 --> 01:34:33.820]   And you know what?
[01:34:33.820 --> 01:34:35.780]   It's free, but throw some money.
[01:34:35.780 --> 01:34:37.460]   Throw some old money.
[01:34:37.460 --> 01:34:41.340]   And of course, Mr. Renee Ritchie from iMore.com
[01:34:41.340 --> 01:34:43.700]   and Andy Ennaco from the Chicago Sun Times.
[01:34:43.700 --> 01:34:48.100]   Do you guys shave?
[01:34:48.100 --> 01:34:48.860]   Only on New Yearly.
[01:34:48.860 --> 01:34:51.940]   You're somewhat in her suit.
[01:34:51.940 --> 01:34:53.900]   I just want to tell you about Harry's.
[01:34:53.900 --> 01:34:58.060]   It's not too late to join the shave revolution.
[01:34:58.060 --> 01:35:02.420]   Harry's a great shave and a fraction of the price.
[01:35:02.420 --> 01:35:04.180]   Holidays are over.
[01:35:04.180 --> 01:35:06.540]   Now we just got to save money and groom.
[01:35:06.540 --> 01:35:08.380]   Grooming is so important.
[01:35:08.380 --> 01:35:11.540]   Shaving, I have to admit, is not fun, but I can't grow beard.
[01:35:11.540 --> 01:35:12.380]   I don't want to grow a beard.
[01:35:12.380 --> 01:35:14.460]   I like having a clean shave face.
[01:35:14.460 --> 01:35:19.460]   So I'm willing to spend money on a good clean shave.
[01:35:19.460 --> 01:35:23.140]   That's why I was spending $4 a blade on my Gillette Fusion
[01:35:23.140 --> 01:35:24.620]   till I found Harry's.
[01:35:24.620 --> 01:35:26.900]   Harry's is a better blade for less money.
[01:35:26.900 --> 01:35:29.140]   I'm actually-- I choose Harry's not because it saves me money,
[01:35:29.140 --> 01:35:29.940]   although it does.
[01:35:29.940 --> 01:35:32.900]   I choose Harry's because it makes the best blades.
[01:35:32.900 --> 01:35:34.580]   They're fantastic.
[01:35:34.580 --> 01:35:36.420]   They engineer them for sharpness and high performance,
[01:35:36.420 --> 01:35:38.740]   and they can do that because they own the factory in Germany
[01:35:38.740 --> 01:35:41.140]   where the blades are made.
[01:35:41.140 --> 01:35:42.700]   They guarantee your satisfaction.
[01:35:42.700 --> 01:35:44.580]   And Harry's kit is a great deal.
[01:35:44.580 --> 01:35:46.340]   There's the Winston.
[01:35:46.340 --> 01:35:49.020]   That's what I have several winstons.
[01:35:49.020 --> 01:35:50.260]   That's $25.
[01:35:50.260 --> 01:35:52.500]   The Truman is $15.
[01:35:52.500 --> 01:35:54.700]   And with every kit, not only do you get the great handle.
[01:35:54.700 --> 01:35:56.580]   And the really big difference is the handle between the Winston
[01:35:56.580 --> 01:35:57.420]   and the Truman.
[01:35:57.420 --> 01:35:59.900]   The Winston has a nice engraved metal handle.
[01:35:59.900 --> 01:36:02.660]   I think actually the plastic handle on the Truman
[01:36:02.660 --> 01:36:04.580]   is actually pretty nice.
[01:36:04.580 --> 01:36:06.900]   Steve Gibson chose that one because he likes the feel of that
[01:36:06.900 --> 01:36:08.220]   in his hand.
[01:36:08.220 --> 01:36:10.180]   You might want more than one Harry's razor kit.
[01:36:10.180 --> 01:36:11.460]   They're so affordable.
[01:36:11.460 --> 01:36:14.260]   With each kit, you get three blades.
[01:36:14.260 --> 01:36:19.740]   The Harry's shave gel or shave cream, your choice.
[01:36:19.740 --> 01:36:22.740]   And by the way, I love-- and it seems like a little thing,
[01:36:22.740 --> 01:36:25.260]   but the Harry's travel cover is really great.
[01:36:25.260 --> 01:36:25.900]   There it is.
[01:36:25.900 --> 01:36:26.940]   There's my Harry's.
[01:36:26.940 --> 01:36:30.620]   And the travel cover-- so when you're going to put this
[01:36:30.620 --> 01:36:33.140]   in your DOP kit, this little travel cover,
[01:36:33.140 --> 01:36:34.020]   don't throw that out.
[01:36:34.020 --> 01:36:35.740]   You might think, oh, well, that was just something to hold.
[01:36:35.740 --> 01:36:36.820]   No.
[01:36:36.820 --> 01:36:37.580]   This is great.
[01:36:37.580 --> 01:36:40.220]   It's got a little ventilation, so the blade dries out.
[01:36:40.220 --> 01:36:41.620]   It keeps you from cutting yourself.
[01:36:41.620 --> 01:36:42.580]   It protects the blade.
[01:36:42.580 --> 01:36:45.340]   This is actually-- I've never seen this before.
[01:36:45.340 --> 01:36:45.740]   I love it.
[01:36:45.740 --> 01:36:46.660]   Thank you, Harry's.
[01:36:46.660 --> 01:36:48.580]   Free shipping for orders over $10 anywhere
[01:36:48.580 --> 01:36:50.500]   in the US or Canada.
[01:36:50.500 --> 01:36:52.100]   You could choose from the foaming gel.
[01:36:52.100 --> 01:36:53.900]   A lot of people like that.
[01:36:53.900 --> 01:36:57.780]   It's more like the gels you'd see in the store.
[01:36:57.780 --> 01:37:00.020]   I personally prefer the cream.
[01:37:00.020 --> 01:37:02.420]   It comes out of just a tube.
[01:37:02.420 --> 01:37:03.420]   And it's just as smooth.
[01:37:03.420 --> 01:37:04.820]   That's what I use every morning.
[01:37:04.820 --> 01:37:06.620]   But I do love my Harry's blades.
[01:37:06.620 --> 01:37:08.380]   Change your blade regularly.
[01:37:08.380 --> 01:37:12.220]   You absolutely, absolutely want to get a Harry's kit
[01:37:12.220 --> 01:37:13.900]   and then sign up for a subscription.
[01:37:13.900 --> 01:37:16.140]   And they have a new aftershave moisturizer that protects
[01:37:16.140 --> 01:37:17.220]   and hydrates skin.
[01:37:17.220 --> 01:37:18.860]   I'm putting this on my head.
[01:37:18.860 --> 01:37:20.780]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:37:20.780 --> 01:37:23.220]   Because I needed something to protect my bald head
[01:37:23.220 --> 01:37:24.380]   for a while.
[01:37:24.380 --> 01:37:25.500]   And this is great.
[01:37:25.500 --> 01:37:27.740]   Harry's, h-a-r-r-y-s.com.

[01:37:40.540 --> 01:37:42.940]   You just put that right on there.
[01:37:42.940 --> 01:37:45.700]   And rub it in.
[01:37:45.700 --> 01:37:47.780]   It's just nice.
[01:37:47.780 --> 01:37:48.780]   Smells good too.
[01:37:48.780 --> 01:37:50.380]   Yeah.
[01:37:50.380 --> 01:37:51.420]   Oh, it feels so good.
[01:37:51.420 --> 01:37:53.260]   Harry's, h-a-r-r-y-s.com.
[01:37:53.260 --> 01:37:53.860]   Do it.
[01:37:53.860 --> 01:37:54.460]   Do it.
[01:37:54.460 --> 01:37:56.940]   Do it.
[01:37:56.940 --> 01:37:57.340]   All right.
[01:37:57.340 --> 01:37:58.740]   There's one everything to be like Harry's Leo.
[01:37:58.740 --> 01:38:00.100]   I want to Harry's for every product.
[01:38:00.100 --> 01:38:01.100]   They're so fantastic.
[01:38:01.100 --> 01:38:01.200]   You know what?
[01:38:01.200 --> 01:38:03.100]   I think that's kind of the internet world
[01:38:03.100 --> 01:38:04.220]   we dream of.
[01:38:04.220 --> 01:38:05.780]   And we're slowly getting there, aren't we?
[01:38:05.780 --> 01:38:08.260]   Because there was Warby Parker kind of changed the way
[01:38:08.260 --> 01:38:09.580]   we buy glasses.
[01:38:09.580 --> 01:38:12.260]   In fact, many of our advertisers are that Casper changed
[01:38:12.260 --> 01:38:14.780]   the way I buy mattresses.
[01:38:14.780 --> 01:38:16.060]   Coffee, Tonks, Coffee.
[01:38:16.060 --> 01:38:18.460]   We have many of the advertisers on our network
[01:38:18.460 --> 01:38:19.740]   are people who are--
[01:38:19.740 --> 01:38:21.820]   because they're going after the early adopters
[01:38:21.820 --> 01:38:24.300]   of forward thinking technology enthusiasts who
[01:38:24.300 --> 01:38:24.820]   live better.
[01:38:24.820 --> 01:38:25.500]   We saw Casper at CES.
[01:38:25.500 --> 01:38:26.340]   They let us jump on their bed.
[01:38:26.340 --> 01:38:26.780]   It was amazing.
[01:38:26.780 --> 01:38:28.940]   It's nice, isn't it?
[01:38:28.940 --> 01:38:29.380]   There you go.
[01:38:29.380 --> 01:38:31.620]   That's a mattress at CES.
[01:38:31.620 --> 01:38:32.300]   Yes.
[01:38:32.300 --> 01:38:33.100]   It tells you something.
[01:38:33.100 --> 01:38:40.380]   Apple Watch, do we have a date?
[01:38:40.380 --> 01:38:41.820]   It'll be like the iPad.
[01:38:41.820 --> 01:38:42.700]   It'll be like the original iPad.
[01:38:42.700 --> 01:38:44.060]   It'll be ready when it's ready.
[01:38:44.060 --> 01:38:44.900]   Is that what you're saying?
[01:38:44.900 --> 01:38:46.220]   You want to date with the Apple Watch?
[01:38:46.220 --> 01:38:46.980]   I do want to date.
[01:38:46.980 --> 01:38:48.260]   I have a date with the Apple Watch.
[01:38:48.260 --> 01:38:49.100]   I just want to know what I can--
[01:38:49.100 --> 01:38:49.820]   It's the most gold one.
[01:38:49.820 --> 01:38:51.340]   It's the diamond.
[01:38:51.340 --> 01:38:52.980]   I want another pricing too.
[01:38:52.980 --> 01:38:55.420]   So according to Mark Gurman, 905Mac,
[01:38:55.420 --> 01:38:56.660]   how often do we say that on the show?
[01:38:56.660 --> 01:39:00.980]   According to Mark Gurman, 905Mac, March.
[01:39:00.980 --> 01:39:03.900]   And the retail training is set for mid-February.
[01:39:03.900 --> 01:39:06.420]   It came back from vacation with a vengeance.
[01:39:06.420 --> 01:39:07.940]   This guy, I tell you.
[01:39:07.940 --> 01:39:09.420]   It's because he's young.
[01:39:09.420 --> 01:39:10.340]   You remember being young.
[01:39:10.340 --> 01:39:10.860]   That's got stamina.
[01:39:10.860 --> 01:39:12.700]   He's got stamina.
[01:39:12.700 --> 01:39:16.740]   Senior Vice President of Retail, Anjala Ahants,
[01:39:16.740 --> 01:39:19.700]   who has the Italian employees, the large launch will occur
[01:39:19.700 --> 01:39:20.940]   in the spring after the Chinese New Year.
[01:39:20.940 --> 01:39:22.460]   We mentioned that.
[01:39:22.460 --> 01:39:28.260]   But now he's got some more concrete information.
[01:39:28.260 --> 01:39:30.620]   One or two representatives from any Apple stores in the US
[01:39:30.620 --> 01:39:34.540]   will be sent to Cupertino or Austin
[01:39:34.540 --> 01:39:37.060]   to get training firsthand on the watch.
[01:39:37.060 --> 01:39:40.460]   February 9th and February 16th are between February 9th and 16th.
[01:39:40.460 --> 01:39:42.500]   That's the one week.
[01:39:42.500 --> 01:39:44.820]   In the couple of days preceding the official watch release,
[01:39:44.820 --> 01:39:47.340]   employees will then train other employees
[01:39:47.340 --> 01:39:49.060]   in their respective stores.
[01:39:49.060 --> 01:39:51.140]   You can wear it on the left wrist
[01:39:51.140 --> 01:39:52.540]   or you can wear it on the right wrist.
[01:39:52.540 --> 01:39:53.620]   They're crowning it wrong.
[01:39:53.620 --> 01:39:54.300]   Stop it.
[01:39:54.300 --> 01:39:56.540]   You're crowning it wrong.
[01:39:56.540 --> 01:39:59.100]   In the months following the device's introduction,
[01:39:59.100 --> 01:40:01.620]   in September, Apple has been polishing up the watch OS
[01:40:01.620 --> 01:40:05.860]   and putting the device's battery through more extensive testing.
[01:40:05.860 --> 01:40:06.820]   Have you-- come on.
[01:40:06.820 --> 01:40:09.020]   You got your ear to the tracks.
[01:40:09.020 --> 01:40:11.020]   Renee Ritchie, have you heard any rumors?
[01:40:11.020 --> 01:40:13.180]   I mean, a lot of people are trying them.
[01:40:13.180 --> 01:40:15.780]   I think there was people throughout Apple
[01:40:15.780 --> 01:40:16.900]   are working on them.
[01:40:16.900 --> 01:40:18.420]   You see people wearing them now, right?
[01:40:18.420 --> 01:40:18.980]   Yeah.
[01:40:18.980 --> 01:40:20.020]   Yeah, people are wearing them.
[01:40:20.020 --> 01:40:21.340]   They're doing all the different features out.
[01:40:21.340 --> 01:40:22.900]   And they're going to get some real life measures.
[01:40:22.900 --> 01:40:25.020]   I think that's why Apple was very careful not to announce
[01:40:25.020 --> 01:40:26.060]   its big battery life.
[01:40:26.060 --> 01:40:28.740]   Well, and Mark even hedges this because he says,
[01:40:28.740 --> 01:40:32.060]   unexpected delays could always push the watch back.
[01:40:32.060 --> 01:40:35.660]   And no one's saying battery life hours.
[01:40:35.660 --> 01:40:37.900]   Yeah, I mean, nothing is real until Apple holds it up on stage.
[01:40:37.900 --> 01:40:40.220]   Everything else is just criminology.
[01:40:40.220 --> 01:40:42.900]   We know $349 for the cheap sport model,
[01:40:42.900 --> 01:40:45.060]   the one you don't want.
[01:40:45.060 --> 01:40:46.500]   I think a lot of people who like that.
[01:40:46.500 --> 01:40:47.620]   In fact, a lot of people have told me
[01:40:47.620 --> 01:40:49.860]   they're getting the gold one, or also getting the sport ones.
[01:40:49.860 --> 01:40:51.100]   They don't have to wear the gold one every day.
[01:40:51.100 --> 01:40:53.980]   I know Adam Angstwil because he's a sporty fella.
[01:40:53.980 --> 01:40:54.500]   Yeah.
[01:40:54.500 --> 01:40:57.220]   Well, I will honestly because if we're
[01:40:57.220 --> 01:40:59.340]   going to have to be getting one of these every year or two
[01:40:59.340 --> 01:41:01.900]   years, I'm certainly not spending more than I have to
[01:41:01.900 --> 01:41:03.140]   on it every time.
[01:41:03.140 --> 01:41:06.700]   Yeah, again, the pricing of the stainless steel one,
[01:41:06.700 --> 01:41:08.900]   I think, is going to define the entire line.
[01:41:08.900 --> 01:41:11.180]   Because you can definitely say the $350
[01:41:11.180 --> 01:41:14.420]   is the minimum buy-in for the sport edition, the quote cheap
[01:41:14.420 --> 01:41:18.380]   one unquote, and the cheap one is $100 to $200 more expensive
[01:41:18.380 --> 01:41:21.860]   than I'm sorry, to $250 more expensive than it's two biggest
[01:41:21.860 --> 01:41:22.700]   competitors.
[01:41:22.700 --> 01:41:27.580]   If the stainless steel one is seven to eight to $900,
[01:41:27.580 --> 01:41:30.180]   OK, you're clearly not much about a consumer product.
[01:41:30.180 --> 01:41:32.500]   Because we know because we know that the gold one is just--
[01:41:32.500 --> 01:41:34.340]   I'm sorry, I should correct myself.
[01:41:34.340 --> 01:41:36.900]   We don't know how much the gold one is going to cost.
[01:41:36.900 --> 01:41:40.020]   When you talk to anybody who makes watches and simply says
[01:41:40.020 --> 01:41:42.580]   that quantity of gold means, this puts us
[01:41:42.580 --> 01:41:46.820]   into multiple thousands, many thousands of dollars,
[01:41:46.820 --> 01:41:49.380]   I really think that Apple is going to have to be very careful
[01:41:49.380 --> 01:41:51.020]   about how they price the stainless steel one.
[01:41:51.020 --> 01:41:53.460]   Rumor sites are saying $500 for stainless.
[01:41:53.460 --> 01:41:55.460]   That would be OK, right?
[01:41:55.460 --> 01:41:56.660]   That's what they're-- that's what they're in reach.
[01:41:56.660 --> 01:41:59.180]   See, I'm so glad that I've had so much experience
[01:41:59.180 --> 01:42:01.860]   with the Android Wear because so many things that I would never
[01:42:01.860 --> 01:42:06.620]   have guessed about my beliefs about wearable smartwatches
[01:42:06.620 --> 01:42:08.020]   were just completely wrong.
[01:42:08.020 --> 01:42:11.900]   Among them that, you know, if this were just for $250,
[01:42:11.900 --> 01:42:14.380]   this watch I'm wearing right now, if all it was
[01:42:14.380 --> 01:42:17.540]   was a source of really cool digital time pieces,
[01:42:17.540 --> 01:42:19.340]   and it had a few nice functions on the side,
[01:42:19.340 --> 01:42:22.180]   but basically I'm still wearing it as a watch,
[01:42:22.180 --> 01:42:25.060]   I would-- it would not be ridiculous for me to spend $250
[01:42:25.060 --> 01:42:27.700]   for a watch that has really cool watch faces
[01:42:27.700 --> 01:42:28.900]   that I could keep swapping out.
[01:42:28.900 --> 01:42:31.900]   It makes double sense when you talk about a $99 device
[01:42:31.900 --> 01:42:32.740]   like the Pebble.
[01:42:32.740 --> 01:42:36.140]   So I could certainly see if all Apple manages to achieve
[01:42:36.140 --> 01:42:38.260]   is to come up with a really cool stylish watch
[01:42:38.260 --> 01:42:41.140]   that has some impeccably designed watch faces,
[01:42:41.140 --> 01:42:43.060]   and there are new ones coming out every single month.
[01:42:43.060 --> 01:42:45.540]   There are a lot of people who would spend $350 for a watch
[01:42:45.540 --> 01:42:46.300]   like that.
[01:42:46.300 --> 01:42:51.660]   I spent $250 for my last-- my first and last really
[01:42:51.660 --> 01:42:53.740]   nice mechanical watch, so I could see that happening.
[01:42:53.740 --> 01:42:55.580]   And then, of course, it'll do much more than that.
[01:42:55.580 --> 01:42:59.100]   So pricing, I think, $500 for a stainless steel watch,
[01:42:59.100 --> 01:43:01.660]   especially something that looks as nice and has the sort
[01:43:01.660 --> 01:43:03.940]   of presence of that stainless steel watch.
[01:43:03.940 --> 01:43:06.060]   That was one of the watches I was able to try.
[01:43:06.060 --> 01:43:09.940]   In September, that's a nice thing to have on your wrist,
[01:43:09.940 --> 01:43:11.540]   and that doesn't seem like it's ridiculous.
[01:43:11.540 --> 01:43:13.020]   But if it's-- if it's going to cost you
[01:43:13.020 --> 01:43:16.260]   like the cost of a MacBook Air to put this on your wrist,
[01:43:16.260 --> 01:43:17.420]   that's something else entirely.
[01:43:17.420 --> 01:43:18.900]   But you can put them back in your wrist.
[01:43:18.900 --> 01:43:19.820]   But you can put them back in your wrist.
[01:43:19.820 --> 01:43:22.100]   He's got pictures of the companion app up.
[01:43:22.100 --> 01:43:22.660]   Oh, OK.
[01:43:22.660 --> 01:43:23.300]   Let's see.
[01:43:23.300 --> 01:43:25.300]   There's a bunch of new features in there, too.
[01:43:25.300 --> 01:43:27.700]   And then the other thing I want to talk about before we go,
[01:43:27.700 --> 01:43:28.900]   let me just run over to 9 to 5.
[01:43:28.900 --> 01:43:33.860]   Oops, I went to 9to5.com, which is not what I was hoping for.
[01:43:33.860 --> 01:43:35.460]   Don't go there, children.
[01:43:35.460 --> 01:43:37.260]   9to5Mac.com.
[01:43:37.260 --> 01:43:39.380]   That's more like it.
[01:43:39.380 --> 01:43:42.340]   Companion app, this is the one that would be on the--
[01:43:42.340 --> 01:43:43.420]   You're on your watch on the phone.
[01:43:43.420 --> 01:43:43.860]   --phone.
[01:43:43.860 --> 01:43:50.180]   So it was like home screen management and communications
[01:43:50.180 --> 01:43:52.940]   preferences and monograms.
[01:43:52.940 --> 01:43:53.620]   You can monograms.
[01:43:53.620 --> 01:43:54.060]   It was nice.
[01:43:54.060 --> 01:43:54.580]   You want to.
[01:43:54.580 --> 01:43:55.420]   A lot of features.
[01:43:55.420 --> 01:43:59.140]   You could also have some health features.
[01:43:59.140 --> 01:44:01.300]   Like, you can be reminded to stand up if you've been sitting
[01:44:01.300 --> 01:44:03.500]   for the first 50 minutes of an hour.
[01:44:03.500 --> 01:44:05.220]   That was announced at the computer.
[01:44:05.220 --> 01:44:05.720]   Yeah.
[01:44:05.720 --> 01:44:06.540]   Push alert.
[01:44:06.540 --> 01:44:08.340]   There's so many little details, though.
[01:44:08.340 --> 01:44:11.060]   I know a lot of people who do keep their watches set
[01:44:11.060 --> 01:44:13.580]   like five minutes slow or five minutes fast
[01:44:13.580 --> 01:44:16.500]   so that they feel as though they're always ahead of schedule.
[01:44:16.500 --> 01:44:18.300]   So it'd be interesting to see if it will just simply allow you
[01:44:18.300 --> 01:44:20.380]   to say, please set the time automatically,
[01:44:20.380 --> 01:44:23.500]   but give me an extra five minutes.
[01:44:23.500 --> 01:44:26.620]   So the watch will have grayscale and successability
[01:44:26.620 --> 01:44:27.220]   features.
[01:44:27.220 --> 01:44:28.620]   Voiceover, that's cool.
[01:44:28.620 --> 01:44:29.620]   Zoom.
[01:44:29.620 --> 01:44:33.580]   Push alerts from phone notification.
[01:44:33.580 --> 01:44:34.580]   Monogram is weird.
[01:44:34.580 --> 01:44:36.580]   So that is on the color watch face.
[01:44:36.580 --> 01:44:38.460]   Yeah, it'll put your initials on the watch face.
[01:44:38.460 --> 01:44:41.660]   The-- it's nice having a three-letter name or a four-letter name
[01:44:41.660 --> 01:44:42.580]   Renee.
[01:44:42.580 --> 01:44:45.100]   You can fit it on there.
[01:44:45.100 --> 01:44:48.900]   And here's the activity stuff.
[01:44:48.900 --> 01:44:50.580]   OK, cool.
[01:44:50.580 --> 01:44:53.140]   So the other thing that happened of interest, I think,
[01:44:53.140 --> 01:44:57.020]   to Mac users at CES was Intel announced its new Broadwell
[01:44:57.020 --> 01:44:57.500]   chips.
[01:44:57.500 --> 01:45:00.300]   This is the talk in the TikTok cycle.
[01:45:00.300 --> 01:45:02.580]   A 14-nanometer processor.
[01:45:02.580 --> 01:45:04.580]   They announced the mobile parts.
[01:45:04.580 --> 01:45:06.420]   Typically, when you hear an announcement like that,
[01:45:06.420 --> 01:45:10.660]   its Apple is first to the table with a laptop based on it.
[01:45:10.660 --> 01:45:12.660]   They've been very close to Intel.
[01:45:12.660 --> 01:45:15.420]   But it was Dell that gets pride of place here
[01:45:15.420 --> 01:45:17.980]   with the new XPS 13, which interestingly is basically
[01:45:17.980 --> 01:45:19.500]   a MacBook Air.
[01:45:19.500 --> 01:45:22.580]   But a lot thinner, they claim 15 hours of battery life.
[01:45:22.580 --> 01:45:24.940]   That's what you'd expect to improve it with this fifth
[01:45:24.940 --> 01:45:25.700]   generation.
[01:45:25.700 --> 01:45:27.780]   Is that one of the fancy sharpscreen?
[01:45:27.780 --> 01:45:28.860]   Yeah, they have two choices.
[01:45:28.860 --> 01:45:32.180]   They have a touchscreen.
[01:45:32.180 --> 01:45:35.740]   You can get the non-touch screen for $7.99.
[01:45:35.740 --> 01:45:39.580]   All right, let's say $800, $900 to $1,000.
[01:45:39.580 --> 01:45:41.900]   But if you want the touchscreen, you
[01:45:41.900 --> 01:45:43.620]   can get a quad HD plus.
[01:45:43.620 --> 01:45:45.620]   They call it, which is--
[01:45:45.620 --> 01:45:47.980]   let me quickly get the resolution of what
[01:45:47.980 --> 01:45:49.500]   the hell quad HD plus is.
[01:45:49.500 --> 01:45:51.620]   They were crowing at CES about some exclusive deal
[01:45:51.620 --> 01:45:53.300]   with sharp for high density--
[01:45:53.300 --> 01:45:56.500]   Yeah, it's probably $25.50 by 1440.
[01:45:56.500 --> 01:45:58.140]   But let me see if I can find it.
[01:45:58.140 --> 01:46:00.380]   And I don't know in a 13-inch display
[01:46:00.380 --> 01:46:01.980]   if you really want that kind of resolution.
[01:46:01.980 --> 01:46:02.660]   But you can get it.
[01:46:02.660 --> 01:46:03.820]   There's supposed to be a 13-inch display that
[01:46:03.820 --> 01:46:05.220]   fit in an 11-inch or 12-inch.
[01:46:05.220 --> 01:46:06.700]   Yeah, and remember we saw--
[01:46:06.700 --> 01:46:08.380]   look at the size of the bezel on this.
[01:46:08.380 --> 01:46:11.620]   Remember we saw these mock-ups of a new 12-inch MacBook
[01:46:11.620 --> 01:46:14.740]   Air that similarly--
[01:46:14.740 --> 01:46:15.940]   and I would--
[01:46:15.940 --> 01:46:18.580]   I think the fact that the Prodwell has come out,
[01:46:18.580 --> 01:46:21.580]   that other manufacturers are making and selling computers
[01:46:21.580 --> 01:46:25.100]   within it, to me, I would guess in the next few weeks,
[01:46:25.100 --> 01:46:27.900]   we're going to see an update to the MacBook Air.
[01:46:27.900 --> 01:46:30.980]   With the potentially this QHD or whatever they call it.
[01:46:30.980 --> 01:46:32.020]   It depends on Apple's cycles.
[01:46:32.020 --> 01:46:34.060]   I mean, they updated it last WVDC.
[01:46:34.060 --> 01:46:36.100]   You don't think they're going to sit on this one?
[01:46:36.100 --> 01:46:38.660]   I don't think they'll rush for--
[01:46:38.660 --> 01:46:41.660]   Because Broadwell Intel's finally pushed out Broadwell.
[01:46:41.660 --> 01:46:44.060]   Also, there's the iPhone 6 effect
[01:46:44.060 --> 01:46:46.260]   where there's so many people who have been delaying,
[01:46:46.260 --> 01:46:48.100]   I think, buying a MacBook Air because they know
[01:46:48.100 --> 01:46:49.420]   what retinomol's coming out.
[01:46:49.420 --> 01:46:50.860]   They know they're going to have to come through
[01:46:50.860 --> 01:46:52.180]   with quantity immediately.
[01:46:52.180 --> 01:46:53.740]   So I don't think that--
[01:46:53.740 --> 01:46:56.300]   I don't think it's going to happen really immediately quickly.
[01:46:56.300 --> 01:46:58.980]   So you think, June?
[01:46:58.980 --> 01:47:01.780]   I would say spring.
[01:47:01.780 --> 01:47:03.420]   The Apple Watch announcement kind of throws
[01:47:03.420 --> 01:47:04.820]   a monkey wrench into things.
[01:47:04.820 --> 01:47:07.980]   Because if Apple makes a--
[01:47:07.980 --> 01:47:10.820]   their first radically different MacBooks
[01:47:10.820 --> 01:47:12.700]   since the total read--
[01:47:12.700 --> 01:47:13.180]   Wow.
[01:47:13.180 --> 01:47:15.220]   --since retina, really, that's going
[01:47:15.220 --> 01:47:16.740]   to be something that they don't want to just slip out
[01:47:16.740 --> 01:47:18.740]   on a Wednesday afternoon press release.
[01:47:18.740 --> 01:47:21.860]   They're going to want to have to show it off in some way,
[01:47:21.860 --> 01:47:22.700]   shape, or form.
[01:47:22.700 --> 01:47:25.700]   But they certainly want to have enough air around the watch
[01:47:25.700 --> 01:47:28.220]   so that everybody's attention is on that instead.
[01:47:28.220 --> 01:47:30.860]   If I were to guess, I would say April,
[01:47:30.860 --> 01:47:32.580]   but that really is a guess.
[01:47:32.580 --> 01:47:35.380]   It's amazing how we all said there's nothing's coming from Apple,
[01:47:35.380 --> 01:47:37.900]   nothing's coming from Apple, especially in the springtime
[01:47:37.900 --> 01:47:38.300]   seasons.
[01:47:38.300 --> 01:47:40.540]   And now there's the watch and the new Apple TV
[01:47:40.540 --> 01:47:43.140]   and the iPad Pro and the new MacBook Air.
[01:47:43.140 --> 01:47:45.140]   Well, spring is always--
[01:47:45.140 --> 01:47:47.220]   spring has always been at least a half likely time
[01:47:47.220 --> 01:47:49.700]   for them to introduce either new notebooks
[01:47:49.700 --> 01:47:51.340]   or updates to notebooks.
[01:47:51.340 --> 01:47:53.620]   Because that's when a lot of orders have to happen for later
[01:47:53.620 --> 01:47:56.020]   in the school year, especially for school systems.
[01:47:56.020 --> 01:47:58.740]   But yeah, of all the things to try to pin down,
[01:47:58.740 --> 01:48:01.100]   I mean, Macs are just almost--
[01:48:01.100 --> 01:48:04.020]   if anybody tells you that they know a schedule for Apple's
[01:48:04.020 --> 01:48:06.020]   releases, they--
[01:48:06.020 --> 01:48:06.660]   I wanted to--
[01:48:06.660 --> 01:48:08.500]   I'm trying to get you to buy them a drink and tell them something.
[01:48:08.500 --> 01:48:09.540]   I'll tell you, the only--
[01:48:09.540 --> 01:48:11.660]   I was so close to pushing the button on this Dell.
[01:48:11.660 --> 01:48:12.820]   And then I thought, oh, well, no, there'll
[01:48:12.820 --> 01:48:15.620]   be a MacBook Air with these specs.
[01:48:15.620 --> 01:48:16.820]   So that's disappointing to me.
[01:48:16.820 --> 01:48:21.940]   This is 3,200 by 1,800, which is 276 pixels per inch
[01:48:21.940 --> 01:48:23.140]   at 400 nits.
[01:48:23.140 --> 01:48:24.860]   It's very bright as well.
[01:48:24.860 --> 01:48:26.540]   It's also super light.
[01:48:26.540 --> 01:48:28.620]   It's 2.6 pounds.
[01:48:28.620 --> 01:48:30.500]   And some people have held this have said,
[01:48:30.500 --> 01:48:32.460]   it feels flimsy because it's so light,
[01:48:32.460 --> 01:48:34.860]   but they have a new magnesium process.
[01:48:34.860 --> 01:48:37.500]   This is-- you know, I-- it's too bad it's--
[01:48:37.500 --> 01:48:38.340]   doesn't run OS 10.
[01:48:38.340 --> 01:48:39.940]   Too bad it's running Windows.
[01:48:39.940 --> 01:48:42.420]   Because I really think this is a great laptop.
[01:48:42.420 --> 01:48:44.740]   And I think this Apple's a little bit missing the boat,
[01:48:44.740 --> 01:48:46.620]   if they don't come up with--
[01:48:46.620 --> 01:48:48.140]   I mean, it depends what they come to.
[01:48:48.140 --> 01:48:49.700]   They might be waiting on some other component
[01:48:49.700 --> 01:48:52.740]   that this doesn't have or that's not ready for them yet.
[01:48:52.740 --> 01:48:53.740]   So let's--
[01:48:53.740 --> 01:48:55.100]   It'll be easier to tell when it actually comes out.
[01:48:55.100 --> 01:48:56.940]   You can compare them side by side.
[01:48:56.940 --> 01:48:57.940]   Mm.
[01:48:57.940 --> 01:48:58.940]   [GASPS]
[01:48:58.940 --> 01:49:00.860]   It's also-- but also look at the pricing.
[01:49:00.860 --> 01:49:03.140]   That is not in any way a cheaply made laptop.
[01:49:03.140 --> 01:49:05.140]   And it's 800 bucks for a 13-inch.
[01:49:05.140 --> 01:49:07.020]   You would certainly call that a retina display,
[01:49:07.020 --> 01:49:08.460]   even without the touch.
[01:49:08.460 --> 01:49:10.060]   Yeah.
[01:49:10.060 --> 01:49:10.700]   Nice.
[01:49:10.700 --> 01:49:11.200]   All right.
[01:49:11.200 --> 01:49:12.860]   It's a terrible responsibility I believe.
[01:49:12.860 --> 01:49:16.100]   I don't envy them whatsoever to have to attend
[01:49:16.100 --> 01:49:19.020]   to every need of every consumer and buy and build
[01:49:19.020 --> 01:49:20.100]   everything.
[01:49:20.100 --> 01:49:21.780]   It's just such a hard position for the--
[01:49:21.780 --> 01:49:22.780]   You're building, guys.
[01:49:22.780 --> 01:49:25.820]   Can I hack and touch this?
[01:49:25.820 --> 01:49:26.340]   Seriously.
[01:49:26.340 --> 01:49:27.820]   I love that being pushed, though, by competition.
[01:49:27.820 --> 01:49:29.140]   And that's the best for everybody.
[01:49:29.140 --> 01:49:30.860]   Absolutely.
[01:49:30.860 --> 01:49:34.980]   It's a good two-ten in the afternoon,
[01:49:34.980 --> 01:49:37.140]   topic for discussion, not one minute before four.
[01:49:37.140 --> 01:49:39.340]   So I will simply say, yes, I agree with that.
[01:49:39.340 --> 01:49:41.860]   I do, but it's really a good topic for discussion.
[01:49:41.860 --> 01:49:42.940]   Can I hack and touch this?
[01:49:42.940 --> 01:49:45.100]   Is it still possible out in the world that--
[01:49:45.100 --> 01:49:46.780]   You have to wait for the kids to get ahold of it, Leo.
[01:49:46.780 --> 01:49:48.300]   The kids, what's the kids get it?
[01:49:48.300 --> 01:49:51.180]   They have to find a flaw in Yosemite to make that happen.
[01:49:51.180 --> 01:49:52.180]   Yeah.
[01:49:52.180 --> 01:49:53.180]   Also, good luck.
[01:49:53.180 --> 01:49:54.820]   I think good luck finding a driver for that display.
[01:49:54.820 --> 01:49:55.820]   Yeah.
[01:49:55.820 --> 01:49:56.820]   Maybe I'll have to live with Windows.
[01:49:56.820 --> 01:49:57.820]   It's OK.
[01:49:57.820 --> 01:49:58.820]   I can live with Windows.
[01:49:58.820 --> 01:50:00.060]   I'm using a Windows phone now.
[01:50:00.060 --> 01:50:01.060]   So why not?
[01:50:01.060 --> 01:50:03.020]   I'm going to go all Windows.
[01:50:03.020 --> 01:50:04.580]   What do you think?
[01:50:04.580 --> 01:50:05.580]   Do I have to recu--
[01:50:05.580 --> 01:50:08.300]   I mean, they need to now that Ed bot and what's his name left?
[01:50:08.300 --> 01:50:09.300]   Yeah, right.
[01:50:09.300 --> 01:50:11.300]   Ed bot's now driving an Android.
[01:50:11.300 --> 01:50:12.300]   I'm Warren.
[01:50:12.300 --> 01:50:13.300]   Christ.
[01:50:13.300 --> 01:50:14.300]   They need me.
[01:50:14.300 --> 01:50:15.660]   This is the only Paul Thoreau and Daniel Ribino left.
[01:50:15.660 --> 01:50:16.660]   That's right.
[01:50:16.660 --> 01:50:18.500]   That's a great move because--
[01:50:18.500 --> 01:50:20.540]   Cortana says, hey, brother.
[01:50:20.540 --> 01:50:21.540]   Anything I can do?
[01:50:21.540 --> 01:50:22.700]   I like that.
[01:50:22.700 --> 01:50:24.940]   I had Cortana call me brother.
[01:50:24.940 --> 01:50:26.780]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:50:26.780 --> 01:50:27.980]   Brother from another mother.
[01:50:27.980 --> 01:50:29.460]   My carbon-based brother.
[01:50:29.460 --> 01:50:31.060]   My carbon-based brother.
[01:50:31.060 --> 01:50:32.700]   All right.
[01:50:32.700 --> 01:50:33.700]   We want to take a break.
[01:50:33.700 --> 01:50:34.700]   Come back here, Pics.
[01:50:34.700 --> 01:50:37.260]   I don't know if Adam, if we warned you-- you've done this before.
[01:50:37.260 --> 01:50:38.260]   Something cool.
[01:50:38.260 --> 01:50:39.260]   Something neat.
[01:50:39.260 --> 01:50:40.260]   Something you'd like everybody to know about.
[01:50:40.260 --> 01:50:41.260]   That picks something unusual.
[01:50:41.260 --> 01:50:43.020]   Something unusual would be nice.
[01:50:43.020 --> 01:50:45.820]   Maybe that internet starter kit.
[01:50:45.820 --> 01:50:48.420]   You know, I think the internet-- I think it's going to go somewhere.
[01:50:48.420 --> 01:50:49.420]   I think that way.
[01:50:49.420 --> 01:50:50.420]   This is the time.
[01:50:50.420 --> 01:50:53.740]   If you're not internet now, you really, really should come on.
[01:50:53.740 --> 01:50:55.740]   Jump on that wagon.

[01:51:18.580 --> 01:51:19.580]   with a will or living trust.
[01:51:19.580 --> 01:51:20.580]   It's inexpensive.
[01:51:20.580 --> 01:51:21.660]   It's easy to do.
[01:51:21.660 --> 01:51:23.540]   We just got the will kit is so cool.
[01:51:23.540 --> 01:51:25.860]   Again, nice beautiful binder and all the paper.
[01:51:25.860 --> 01:51:27.980]   It's so great.
[01:51:27.980 --> 01:51:29.940]   You can also take control of your financial affairs.
[01:51:29.940 --> 01:51:31.100]   Ready to start a business?

[01:51:41.420 --> 01:51:43.140]   There's all sorts of information there.
[01:51:43.140 --> 01:51:44.180]   I love it.

[01:51:46.980 --> 01:51:48.700]   of people, including me.

[01:51:51.260 --> 01:51:54.420]   I have been very happy with the service, the support,
[01:51:54.420 --> 01:51:56.420]   the price at LegalZoom.com.
[01:51:56.420 --> 01:51:57.460]   And you know what's nice?
[01:51:57.460 --> 01:51:58.700]   And I hadn't used this before.
[01:51:58.700 --> 01:51:59.620]   They added this recently.
[01:51:59.620 --> 01:52:01.540]   If you'd like more help, they can connect you
[01:52:01.540 --> 01:52:05.900]   with independent attorneys in almost every state.
[01:52:05.900 --> 01:52:07.020]   They've pre-vetted these.
[01:52:07.020 --> 01:52:08.860]   You can read their online profiles
[01:52:08.860 --> 01:52:12.740]   and even reviews from users, unedited reviews from users
[01:52:12.740 --> 01:52:14.540]   so you can see which one's right for you.
[01:52:14.540 --> 01:52:15.740]   LegalZoom, it's not a law firm.
[01:52:15.740 --> 01:52:17.380]   It's better.
[01:52:17.380 --> 01:52:21.340]   Don't let another year pass before getting your life in order.
[01:52:21.340 --> 01:52:23.140]   For legal help you can count on for your family

[01:52:43.220 --> 01:52:47.140]   All right, he's got something weird,
[01:52:47.140 --> 01:52:48.260]   he's got something different.
[01:52:48.260 --> 01:52:49.460]   Let's hear it, Adam.
[01:52:49.460 --> 01:52:51.460]   Anks of tidbits.com.
[01:52:51.460 --> 01:52:56.020]   - Okay, so this actually does sort of come from the kids
[01:52:56.020 --> 01:53:01.020]   in that I heard it from my wife's niece and nephew,
[01:53:01.020 --> 01:53:04.700]   her aunt's kids who are high school college age.
[01:53:04.700 --> 01:53:09.300]   And it's not an app, it's not a program,
[01:53:09.300 --> 01:53:11.540]   it's not something you're gonna use on your computer.
[01:53:11.540 --> 01:53:12.700]   It's fiction.
[01:53:12.700 --> 01:53:15.820]   And it's online fiction, it's called worm.
[01:53:15.820 --> 01:53:18.460]   And it's superhero fiction for those of us
[01:53:18.460 --> 01:53:21.380]   who were always more into the stories than the art.
[01:53:21.380 --> 01:53:24.580]   And I can read a comic book in five minutes.
[01:53:24.580 --> 01:53:27.980]   It's really just, it just goes way too fast.
[01:53:27.980 --> 01:53:31.420]   But this is, let's me imagine it all in my head
[01:53:31.420 --> 01:53:32.900]   in terms of what's going on.
[01:53:32.900 --> 01:53:35.780]   It's the guy's a new writer, but he's pretty good
[01:53:35.780 --> 01:53:36.900]   and he gets better throughout it.
[01:53:36.900 --> 01:53:38.660]   I guess it took him a couple of years to write this.
[01:53:38.660 --> 01:53:41.780]   It's all blog posts, it comes doing it twice a week,
[01:53:41.780 --> 01:53:43.940]   I guess, for those years.
[01:53:43.940 --> 01:53:46.300]   And I have to say, it's a pretty compelling story.
[01:53:46.300 --> 01:53:48.740]   You get into it and you wanna read the next chapter.
[01:53:48.740 --> 01:53:50.540]   You can read the next chapter.
[01:53:50.540 --> 01:53:52.540]   I've been reading it all on the iPhone,
[01:53:52.540 --> 01:53:54.580]   using the reader mode to get it up to a nice size.
[01:53:54.580 --> 01:53:57.500]   And hey, just, I recommend it.
[01:53:57.500 --> 01:54:01.060]   People who like comics, worth trying.
[01:54:01.060 --> 01:54:04.100]   - And is this a Patreon?
[01:54:04.100 --> 01:54:05.140]   - Yeah. - That's great.
[01:54:05.140 --> 01:54:08.180]   - Yeah, and as I just ran into it recently.
[01:54:08.180 --> 01:54:09.620]   So I'm not even done with it.
[01:54:09.620 --> 01:54:11.580]   I was just like, this is really cool.
[01:54:11.580 --> 01:54:12.940]   I'm really enjoying this.
[01:54:12.940 --> 01:54:15.980]   And so yeah, so I just had something a little different
[01:54:15.980 --> 01:54:16.820]   this time.
[01:54:16.820 --> 01:54:18.540]   - For all the negatives we talk about on the internet,
[01:54:18.540 --> 01:54:20.020]   this is really what it's all about,
[01:54:20.020 --> 01:54:24.620]   is that somebody can do this, it's so great.
[01:54:24.620 --> 01:54:26.420]   And maybe live their dream.
[01:54:26.420 --> 01:54:28.420]   Well, you get great stuff.
[01:54:28.420 --> 01:54:29.260]   - Awesome. - I love it.
[01:54:29.260 --> 01:54:31.900]   And so the website for this is ParaHumans,
[01:54:31.900 --> 01:54:36.060]   P-A-R-A-H-U-M-A-N-S.WordPress.com.
[01:54:36.060 --> 01:54:38.460]   That's the actual URL, but I bet you there's a short one.
[01:54:38.460 --> 01:54:39.500]   Is there a short one?
[01:54:39.500 --> 01:54:41.300]   - No, that's the only way I found it.
[01:54:41.300 --> 01:54:44.460]   - Google Worm Online Fiction.
[01:54:44.460 --> 01:54:45.740]   Maybe that'll help.
[01:54:45.740 --> 01:54:47.820]   W, not W-U-R-M.
[01:54:47.820 --> 01:54:49.700]   Although that would have been good.
[01:54:49.700 --> 01:54:52.500]   W-O-R-M, not the Worm Worm.
[01:54:52.500 --> 01:54:55.780]   Andy and I co your pick of the week.
[01:54:55.780 --> 01:54:58.380]   - I have to call an audible here from yesterday
[01:54:58.380 --> 01:55:01.380]   because I bought an app for the iPad over the weekend.
[01:55:01.380 --> 01:55:03.780]   That came so highly recommended by a friend of mine
[01:55:03.780 --> 01:55:05.260]   and I really was excited about it.
[01:55:05.260 --> 01:55:08.220]   And that it failed on me miserably yesterday.
[01:55:08.220 --> 01:55:10.180]   So I'm gonna keep on working out to see
[01:55:10.180 --> 01:55:12.780]   if maybe I screwed something up or something happened.
[01:55:12.780 --> 01:55:17.780]   But in the meantime, I'll pull an all star out of the archives,
[01:55:17.780 --> 01:55:22.100]   which is a shirt pocket software super duper backup utility.
[01:55:22.100 --> 01:55:25.580]   'Cause that one really came through for me last week
[01:55:25.580 --> 01:55:29.100]   where I had a, it's a backup utility that unlike Time Machine,
[01:55:29.100 --> 01:55:30.820]   it's a good companion for Time Machine
[01:55:30.820 --> 01:55:33.620]   because we're as Time Machine makes incremental backups
[01:55:33.620 --> 01:55:36.820]   and puts it in a form where restoring a hard drive
[01:55:36.820 --> 01:55:38.860]   to a workable condition takes a long time
[01:55:38.860 --> 01:55:41.260]   and it's hard to have multiple backups.
[01:55:41.260 --> 01:55:43.340]   Super duper will take your entire drive.
[01:55:43.340 --> 01:55:44.900]   It will give you a disk image file
[01:55:44.900 --> 01:55:47.860]   that will be openable by any version of the operating system
[01:55:47.860 --> 01:55:49.860]   that works with disk utility.
[01:55:49.860 --> 01:55:52.020]   And it's easy to simply put you right back
[01:55:52.020 --> 01:55:53.860]   where you started from with a bootable drive,
[01:55:53.860 --> 01:55:55.380]   even taking an internal drive
[01:55:55.380 --> 01:55:58.860]   and cloning it onto a bootable external drive.
[01:55:58.860 --> 01:56:00.500]   Anything you wanna do, it'll help you with it.
[01:56:00.500 --> 01:56:03.700]   My problem was that I'm putting away an older Mac
[01:56:03.700 --> 01:56:05.460]   that I already have a backup of somewhere
[01:56:05.460 --> 01:56:06.700]   but I wanna say, okay, well, you know what,
[01:56:06.700 --> 01:56:08.700]   I haven't really used this for about a year.
[01:56:08.700 --> 01:56:10.980]   Let's just make one last final backup.
[01:56:10.980 --> 01:56:12.860]   The reason why I was finally really putting it away
[01:56:12.860 --> 01:56:16.060]   was because the drive was starting to throw off that sectors.
[01:56:16.060 --> 01:56:18.940]   So it was still working but occasionally would crash.
[01:56:18.940 --> 01:56:22.900]   Super duper didn't, it's not a disk repair utility
[01:56:22.900 --> 01:56:26.300]   but it's written so well that when it fails,
[01:56:26.300 --> 01:56:28.980]   it is absolutely verbose about what happened.
[01:56:28.980 --> 01:56:33.100]   No, sorry data could not be written, a operation failed.
[01:56:33.100 --> 01:56:34.140]   It will, here's a button,
[01:56:34.140 --> 01:56:36.380]   here is everything that I was doing
[01:56:36.380 --> 01:56:39.580]   for the entire six hours I was trying to back up this drive
[01:56:39.580 --> 01:56:41.340]   and here is the thing I tried to do
[01:56:41.340 --> 01:56:42.740]   that caused things to fail.
[01:56:42.740 --> 01:56:45.900]   So that became really, really easy over the course
[01:56:45.900 --> 01:56:48.140]   of six or seven different backup attempts
[01:56:48.140 --> 01:56:50.900]   to identify those very, very few files
[01:56:50.900 --> 01:56:52.540]   that have been affected by this,
[01:56:52.540 --> 01:56:54.180]   delete or move those files
[01:56:54.180 --> 01:56:56.660]   and then finally have a complete backup,
[01:56:56.660 --> 01:56:58.660]   minus five files entirely.
[01:56:58.660 --> 01:57:00.220]   So yes, there are $100 utilities
[01:57:00.220 --> 01:57:02.300]   that will maybe fix damage and diagnose stuff.
[01:57:02.300 --> 01:57:03.980]   That was not gonna be necessary.
[01:57:03.980 --> 01:57:06.180]   I was glad that this $27 utility
[01:57:06.180 --> 01:57:08.980]   that I rely on every single day to back up.
[01:57:08.980 --> 01:57:11.060]   Most of really all my critical data
[01:57:11.060 --> 01:57:14.340]   was able to be generous enough
[01:57:14.340 --> 01:57:16.180]   to help me fix a problem as well.
[01:57:16.180 --> 01:57:17.060]   And the great thing is,
[01:57:17.060 --> 01:57:19.100]   27 bucks is what you pay to unlock things
[01:57:19.100 --> 01:57:22.060]   like scheduling features and bonus stuff like that.
[01:57:22.060 --> 01:57:24.340]   Anybody right now can go to shirtpocket.com,
[01:57:24.340 --> 01:57:26.300]   download this app for free
[01:57:26.300 --> 01:57:27.740]   and press that one button
[01:57:27.740 --> 01:57:29.940]   and back up their hard drive with it.
[01:57:29.940 --> 01:57:31.740]   It's not like a time limited thing.
[01:57:31.740 --> 01:57:32.780]   It's like the core feature,
[01:57:32.780 --> 01:57:35.220]   which is to click a button, create a disk image,
[01:57:35.220 --> 01:57:38.180]   a bootable disk image that is a clone of this drive
[01:57:38.180 --> 01:57:41.420]   that I'm pointing it to is completely free.
[01:57:41.420 --> 01:57:43.340]   And it's just a 27 bucks for the stuff
[01:57:43.340 --> 01:57:45.460]   that makes it a daily, daily use utility.
[01:57:45.460 --> 01:57:46.660]   Great stuff.
[01:57:46.660 --> 01:57:49.180]   - You know, you feel like anybody who has a Mac by now
[01:57:49.180 --> 01:57:50.300]   should know my super duper,
[01:57:50.300 --> 01:57:53.700]   but I think it's still often people don't.
[01:57:53.700 --> 01:57:54.700]   A lot of people I think,
[01:57:54.700 --> 01:57:56.020]   I've got time machine
[01:57:56.020 --> 01:57:57.460]   so I don't need another backup utility.
[01:57:57.460 --> 01:57:59.260]   Again, it's a good companion for those two
[01:57:59.260 --> 01:58:01.340]   because they work with each other very well.
[01:58:01.340 --> 01:58:02.180]   - Yeah.
[01:58:02.180 --> 01:58:03.700]   - I was gonna say I use super duper all the time,
[01:58:03.700 --> 01:58:05.020]   except for the fact that I never see it
[01:58:05.020 --> 01:58:08.060]   because it kicks off at 922 at night,
[01:58:08.060 --> 01:58:09.700]   backs up my machine and goes to sleep.
[01:58:09.700 --> 01:58:10.540]   You know, just as peers.
[01:58:10.540 --> 01:58:12.220]   I never see it at all like,
[01:58:12.220 --> 01:58:14.260]   oh yeah, is that still running every time I check?
[01:58:14.260 --> 01:58:15.420]   Oh yeah, look, it's still running.
[01:58:15.420 --> 01:58:16.260]   - Absolutely.
[01:58:16.260 --> 01:58:17.500]   - You know, make sure, check in on it.
[01:58:17.500 --> 01:58:18.500]   Great stuff.
[01:58:18.500 --> 01:58:20.140]   - Also, Dave Nainen is an amazing phone
[01:58:20.140 --> 01:58:22.260]   and computer fan of all different platforms.
[01:58:22.260 --> 01:58:25.620]   - Yeah, he's also mentioned that whenever I talk
[01:58:25.620 --> 01:58:27.580]   about both this and BB edit,
[01:58:27.580 --> 01:58:29.980]   I have to say that Dave Nainen is one of my best friends.
[01:58:29.980 --> 01:58:32.540]   I had dinner with him over the weekend.
[01:58:32.540 --> 01:58:34.980]   And, but one of the reason why we became friends
[01:58:34.980 --> 01:58:37.140]   is because I was having a problem with super duper
[01:58:37.140 --> 01:58:39.740]   and he immediately like started replying
[01:58:39.740 --> 01:58:40.580]   and we had conversations.
[01:58:40.580 --> 01:58:43.100]   Well, why, why doesn't do this or should I have a progress bar
[01:58:43.100 --> 01:58:44.500]   that gives you a time and it will say,
[01:58:44.500 --> 01:58:46.420]   well, here's a, that would be a great idea.
[01:58:46.420 --> 01:58:48.780]   Unfortunately, here's how it's difficult for us to do.
[01:58:48.780 --> 01:58:50.300]   That's sort of a feature.
[01:58:50.300 --> 01:58:53.980]   And anytime that's like, we're making plans to see a movie,
[01:58:53.980 --> 01:58:56.100]   oftentimes it's like, okay, I gotta answer these
[01:58:56.100 --> 01:59:00.340]   130 customer emails first, but then we can go.
[01:59:00.340 --> 01:59:03.340]   So again, great, great guy, great product.
[01:59:03.340 --> 01:59:05.140]   Highly, highly recommended.
[01:59:05.140 --> 01:59:07.860]   If you have a Mac, you have to have that program.
[01:59:07.860 --> 01:59:09.540]   Renee Richie, your pick of the week.
[01:59:09.540 --> 01:59:11.620]   - So I have a tip more than a pick.
[01:59:11.620 --> 01:59:14.300]   When I was at the, I think the iPhone or iPad event,
[01:59:14.300 --> 01:59:15.660]   I was talking to Dieter Bohn,
[01:59:15.660 --> 01:59:18.100]   who's currently managing editor at the Verge.
[01:59:18.100 --> 01:59:20.260]   And we were talking about how you could cover events
[01:59:20.260 --> 01:59:24.820]   with just iPhones and he had the idea of using hyperlapse
[01:59:24.820 --> 01:59:27.780]   from Instagram, but using it in one X mode.
[01:59:27.780 --> 01:59:29.180]   So not using it to speed anything up,
[01:59:29.180 --> 01:59:30.940]   but just using it in real time mode.
[01:59:30.940 --> 01:59:33.540]   And because it does all that fancy sensor derived
[01:59:33.540 --> 01:59:36.020]   auto stabilization, he thought that it would do
[01:59:36.020 --> 01:59:37.740]   a really good job of capturing, you know,
[01:59:37.740 --> 01:59:39.420]   sometimes when you're by yourself and using an iPhone,
[01:59:39.420 --> 01:59:41.660]   it's jittery or it moves around a lot.
[01:59:41.660 --> 01:59:43.140]   So we tried it out at CES.
[01:59:43.140 --> 01:59:44.940]   There was a time when all the cameras were out
[01:59:44.940 --> 01:59:47.340]   and we had to go run and actually film
[01:59:47.340 --> 01:59:48.460]   some of the home kit stuff.
[01:59:48.460 --> 01:59:50.020]   And all we had was a couple of iPhones.
[01:59:50.020 --> 01:59:51.460]   So we used one as a microphone.
[01:59:51.460 --> 01:59:53.620]   We used the other as a video recorder
[01:59:53.620 --> 01:59:55.900]   and we used hyperlapse in one X mode.
[01:59:55.900 --> 01:59:57.220]   And it was really solid.
[01:59:57.220 --> 01:59:59.300]   It was no jitter, even when our hands moved
[01:59:59.300 --> 02:00:01.980]   a little bit, hyperlapse compensated for that.
[02:00:01.980 --> 02:00:04.580]   And then we just airdropped all the files to the same Mac
[02:00:04.580 --> 02:00:06.500]   and put it all together in Final Cut Pro
[02:00:06.500 --> 02:00:07.340]   and it worked really, really well.
[02:00:07.340 --> 02:00:08.180]   - I wanna see it.
[02:00:08.180 --> 02:00:09.180]   Do you have a link?
[02:00:09.180 --> 02:00:13.060]   - If you go to i'more.com, it's the InSipio video.
[02:00:13.060 --> 02:00:14.140]   They should be right at the top.
[02:00:14.140 --> 02:00:15.540]   - Oh good.
[02:00:15.540 --> 02:00:17.140]   - That's, you know, I've always thought,
[02:00:17.140 --> 02:00:18.660]   why do we bring all these big cameras?
[02:00:18.660 --> 02:00:21.500]   We've got these great cameras in our phones,
[02:00:21.500 --> 02:00:25.580]   but I think improving the quality to the point.
[02:00:25.580 --> 02:00:26.780]   - You don't get the depth of field
[02:00:26.780 --> 02:00:27.860]   and some of the other things that you get
[02:00:27.860 --> 02:00:29.380]   with like a fancy--
[02:00:29.380 --> 02:00:31.140]   - But wait a minute, this is shot with an iPhone
[02:00:31.140 --> 02:00:32.300]   and hyperlapse?
[02:00:32.300 --> 02:00:33.140]   - Yep.
[02:00:33.140 --> 02:00:33.980]   - Wow.
[02:00:33.980 --> 02:00:34.820]   You know what?
[02:00:34.820 --> 02:00:36.700]   It looks like a steady cam.
[02:00:36.700 --> 02:00:37.540]   - Yeah, it's awesome.
[02:00:37.540 --> 02:00:38.940]   - It's not perfect because I was a little bit jittery,
[02:00:38.940 --> 02:00:40.660]   especially at first, but yeah.
[02:00:40.660 --> 02:00:42.500]   And she's recording all, when you see her talking
[02:00:42.500 --> 02:00:43.900]   into her iPhone, she's recording all the audio
[02:00:43.900 --> 02:00:44.900]   on the iPhone as well.
[02:00:44.900 --> 02:00:49.900]   - I have to say, this is every bit as good as the $1,500
[02:00:49.900 --> 02:00:54.820]   they camera package and shooter we pay for.
[02:00:54.820 --> 02:00:57.540]   - If you ever get into manufacturing,
[02:00:57.540 --> 02:00:58.980]   I'm gonna give you a million dollar an idea.
[02:00:58.980 --> 02:01:00.980]   An iPhone case that makes it look like one of the
[02:01:00.980 --> 02:01:03.100]   old-timey news broadcast,
[02:01:03.100 --> 02:01:04.900]   we sort of microphones.
[02:01:04.900 --> 02:01:07.260]   - Yeah, I mean like she had just gotten a case
[02:01:07.260 --> 02:01:08.900]   from someone who was making Pantone cases,
[02:01:08.900 --> 02:01:10.660]   which he slapped on her phone and didn't think about it
[02:01:10.660 --> 02:01:11.980]   and then we ran out.
[02:01:11.980 --> 02:01:16.980]   - So this is just, you notice there's a significant
[02:01:16.980 --> 02:01:19.300]   smoothing of the video from hyperlapse?
[02:01:19.300 --> 02:01:22.740]   - Not especially, the one problem I have with hyperlapse
[02:01:22.740 --> 02:01:24.940]   is if you don't pay attention, you can easily save it
[02:01:24.940 --> 02:01:26.540]   in 6x mode and then you're still up,
[02:01:26.540 --> 02:01:28.140]   you can't go back and undo it.
[02:01:28.140 --> 02:01:29.980]   So I have a couple, I took a picture,
[02:01:29.980 --> 02:01:31.580]   I went to the Canon booth and looked at all their
[02:01:31.580 --> 02:01:34.260]   magnificent glorious glass and this long stretch
[02:01:34.260 --> 02:01:35.900]   and I did a video with it in hyperlapse,
[02:01:35.900 --> 02:01:37.460]   hoping that it'd be super stable,
[02:01:37.460 --> 02:01:39.620]   and then accidentally hit the 6x button.
[02:01:39.620 --> 02:01:41.260]   And then tried to slow it down and it was like
[02:01:41.260 --> 02:01:42.540]   a series of stills.
[02:01:42.540 --> 02:01:45.180]   So you have to pay really close attention
[02:01:45.180 --> 02:01:46.500]   and there's no second chance,
[02:01:46.500 --> 02:01:49.020]   but if you really need to use it, it does a really good job.
[02:01:49.020 --> 02:01:51.420]   - It's remarkable, hyperlapse is free from Instagram
[02:01:51.420 --> 02:01:53.340]   and yeah, if you have an iPhone,
[02:01:53.340 --> 02:01:54.180]   you don't have a hyperlapse.
[02:01:54.180 --> 02:01:57.460]   And by the way, as to date, still no Android version,
[02:01:57.460 --> 02:01:59.940]   although they said it was capable with Lollipop.
[02:01:59.940 --> 02:02:00.780]   Wow, that was good.
[02:02:00.780 --> 02:02:02.740]   - I should point out the zoom was done in Final Cut.
[02:02:02.740 --> 02:02:04.980]   - Oh yeah, I saw these great zooms,
[02:02:04.980 --> 02:02:06.140]   I thought you're going like this.
[02:02:06.140 --> 02:02:06.980]   - No, the zoom was on.
[02:02:06.980 --> 02:02:09.380]   - Yeah, 'cause me stepping around will not be good for anybody.
[02:02:09.380 --> 02:02:10.860]   (laughing)
[02:02:10.860 --> 02:02:12.140]   - Oh, I was impressed.
[02:02:12.140 --> 02:02:13.300]   - Hey, I have a quick recommendation
[02:02:13.300 --> 02:02:15.900]   and it ties into the next show because I don't,
[02:02:15.900 --> 02:02:18.620]   if you've seen the imitation game,
[02:02:18.620 --> 02:02:19.980]   you already know what a great movie it is,
[02:02:19.980 --> 02:02:22.580]   Benedict's Cumberbatch plays Alan Turing.
[02:02:23.540 --> 02:02:28.060]   It is a beautiful, well-made, brilliant movie
[02:02:28.060 --> 02:02:30.780]   that highlights not only the guy who helped,
[02:02:30.780 --> 02:02:34.020]   probably single-handedly with the help of his team,
[02:02:34.020 --> 02:02:36.060]   beat the Germans in World War II
[02:02:36.060 --> 02:02:38.860]   by cracking their code machine enigma,
[02:02:38.860 --> 02:02:40.580]   but also really laid the foundations
[02:02:40.580 --> 02:02:43.500]   for the computers we use today
[02:02:43.500 --> 02:02:46.820]   and was horribly persecuted by the British government
[02:02:46.820 --> 02:02:48.980]   afterwards because he's gay
[02:02:48.980 --> 02:02:51.340]   and ended up committing suicide.
[02:02:51.340 --> 02:02:53.020]   It's a very moving movie.
[02:02:53.020 --> 02:02:55.180]   At the end, I'm kind of like Terry
[02:02:55.180 --> 02:02:57.980]   because they say he invented computers
[02:02:57.980 --> 02:03:00.700]   and it just really didn't get acknowledged
[02:03:00.700 --> 02:03:03.340]   until last year when our friend John Graham coming
[02:03:03.340 --> 02:03:06.540]   created a petition which persuaded the British government
[02:03:06.540 --> 02:03:08.740]   and the Queen of England to pardon him
[02:03:08.740 --> 02:03:11.500]   and apologize for the persecution.
[02:03:11.500 --> 02:03:12.780]   If you haven't seen this game yet,
[02:03:12.780 --> 02:03:14.140]   I don't know if you guys seen it.
[02:03:14.140 --> 02:03:16.140]   - I saw it beautiful, beautiful movie.
[02:03:16.140 --> 02:03:17.460]   - Really well.
[02:03:17.460 --> 02:03:19.500]   - Between that, the theory of everything,
[02:03:19.500 --> 02:03:22.940]   what a great season for movies about smart people.
[02:03:22.940 --> 02:03:23.780]   - Yeah.
[02:03:23.780 --> 02:03:24.620]   - I love this movie.
[02:03:24.620 --> 02:03:25.740]   - I was a little worried 'cause you know,
[02:03:25.740 --> 02:03:27.180]   I've read some reviews that said,
[02:03:27.180 --> 02:03:28.380]   oh here we go again, you know,
[02:03:28.380 --> 02:03:29.820]   they're gonna portray the mathematician
[02:03:29.820 --> 02:03:32.100]   as this kind of weird nerdy guy.
[02:03:32.100 --> 02:03:36.020]   I think this was actually a pretty accurate portrayal of
[02:03:36.020 --> 02:03:39.700]   Turing, it's based on a very complete biography of him
[02:03:39.700 --> 02:03:42.260]   and I think Cumberbatch is amazing.
[02:03:42.260 --> 02:03:43.620]   - He was raving about it.
[02:03:43.620 --> 02:03:44.700]   - Yeah.
[02:03:44.700 --> 02:03:47.020]   - One of the things I love about it is that
[02:03:47.020 --> 02:03:49.340]   the trope that you often see is that
[02:03:49.340 --> 02:03:50.740]   he's a mathematical genius.
[02:03:50.740 --> 02:03:52.700]   He's just, you see him bouncing a ball,
[02:03:52.700 --> 02:03:54.220]   that's suddenly like the ball ball.
[02:03:54.220 --> 02:03:56.060]   Wait a minute, that's it.
[02:03:56.060 --> 02:03:56.980]   - That's what I don't like.
[02:03:56.980 --> 02:03:57.980]   - No, it doesn't do that.
[02:03:57.980 --> 02:03:58.820]   - This doesn't do that.
[02:03:58.820 --> 02:04:02.540]   - Cranking on this problem for weeks and weeks and weeks
[02:04:02.540 --> 02:04:05.380]   and then you get this, he gets this first,
[02:04:05.380 --> 02:04:07.060]   he and his team get this first,
[02:04:07.060 --> 02:04:09.340]   tiniest inkling, not that this thing is working,
[02:04:09.340 --> 02:04:12.300]   but that, oh, it has now failed in such a way
[02:04:12.300 --> 02:04:15.500]   that maybe now we think this actually will, oh,
[02:04:15.500 --> 02:04:17.780]   just such a great lesson that success comes
[02:04:17.780 --> 02:04:20.620]   is the daughter of, or the son of just hundreds
[02:04:20.620 --> 02:04:21.740]   and hundreds of little failures.
[02:04:21.740 --> 02:04:23.020]   - And I do look forward to reading,
[02:04:23.020 --> 02:04:25.100]   as we're seeing the theory of everything
[02:04:25.100 --> 02:04:25.980]   that Stephen Hawking story,
[02:04:25.980 --> 02:04:27.660]   'cause I hear very good things about that too.
[02:04:27.660 --> 02:04:29.580]   So a couple of good movies for geeks.
[02:04:29.580 --> 02:04:30.900]   - I have a theaters today.
[02:04:30.900 --> 02:04:33.860]   - I got, I went to, I actually went to an advanced screening
[02:04:33.860 --> 02:04:36.060]   and I have the commemorative, like advanced screening
[02:04:36.060 --> 02:04:37.340]   plastic paper. - Oh, nice.
[02:04:37.340 --> 02:04:38.180]   Nice.
[02:04:38.180 --> 02:04:39.020]   - Nice.
[02:04:39.020 --> 02:04:40.940]   - I don't know what that has to do with the,
[02:04:40.940 --> 02:04:44.340]   with the, with the Hawking, but I have a free from there.
[02:04:44.340 --> 02:04:47.300]   I don't have to run the dishwasher for yet one more meal.
[02:04:47.300 --> 02:04:51.060]   The imitation game, highly recommended.
[02:04:51.060 --> 02:04:51.900]   Thank you everybody.
[02:04:51.900 --> 02:04:56.740]   And the reason I mentioned that is because on our next show
[02:04:56.740 --> 02:04:57.820]   on our recording schedule,
[02:04:57.820 --> 02:05:01.380]   Steve Gibson is going to explain how Enigma works.
[02:05:01.380 --> 02:05:02.380]   - It's awesome.
[02:05:02.380 --> 02:05:03.940]   - I think this should be fun.
[02:05:03.940 --> 02:05:06.860]   So security now is coming up and unless,
[02:05:06.860 --> 02:05:09.660]   unless security news has prompted a change of schedule
[02:05:09.660 --> 02:05:11.420]   which sometimes has happened,
[02:05:11.420 --> 02:05:14.860]   the secrets of Enigma coming up on the Twit network.
[02:05:14.860 --> 02:05:18.420]   - Thank you very much Adam Anks for making some time for us
[02:05:18.420 --> 02:05:20.020]   in the bitterly cold.
[02:05:20.020 --> 02:05:22.300]   - I got to stay inside.
[02:05:22.300 --> 02:05:23.820]   You kidding? - This is perfect.
[02:05:23.820 --> 02:05:26.860]   - He brought his penguin and we're glad to have him.
[02:05:26.860 --> 02:05:28.340]   Everybody must go to tidbits,
[02:05:28.340 --> 02:05:30.940]   T-I-D-B-I-T-S.com and sign up today.
[02:05:30.940 --> 02:05:31.780]   - Thank you, Leo.
[02:05:31.780 --> 02:05:32.620]   - It's a must read.
[02:05:32.620 --> 02:05:34.620]   I mean, it's where I get all my Mac information
[02:05:34.620 --> 02:05:37.460]   and have for 24 years.
[02:05:37.460 --> 02:05:39.620]   - Yeah, coming up in 25 in April.
[02:05:39.620 --> 02:05:40.460]   - That's so awesome.
[02:05:40.460 --> 02:05:42.300]   - We did not yet know what we're gonna do,
[02:05:42.300 --> 02:05:43.660]   but something's gotta be had.
[02:05:43.660 --> 02:05:44.500]   - Yeah.
[02:05:44.500 --> 02:05:45.500]   - 25 years.
[02:05:45.500 --> 02:05:46.340]   - Jesus.
[02:05:46.340 --> 02:05:47.180]   - That's nice.
[02:05:47.180 --> 02:05:48.020]   Thank you Adam, really appreciate it.
[02:05:48.020 --> 02:05:49.140]   We should have you back more often.
[02:05:49.140 --> 02:05:50.220]   So great.
[02:05:50.220 --> 02:05:52.820]   Renee Ritchie from iMour.com, a regular on the show.
[02:05:52.820 --> 02:05:53.700]   Always glad to have you.
[02:05:53.700 --> 02:05:58.700]   Glad you survived CES without any noticeable wear and tear.
[02:05:58.700 --> 02:06:00.340]   - Oh no plague also.
[02:06:00.340 --> 02:06:01.660]   - And no plague.
[02:06:01.660 --> 02:06:03.180]   - Is it possible?
[02:06:03.180 --> 02:06:04.540]   - It's beating the odds.
[02:06:04.540 --> 02:06:06.980]   I don't know how you do it.
[02:06:06.980 --> 02:06:08.860]   - He was actually wearing a gas mask the whole time.
[02:06:08.860 --> 02:06:09.860]   - Has a matt suit.
[02:06:09.860 --> 02:06:13.100]   - And Andy and Ico of course,
[02:06:13.100 --> 02:06:16.260]   it's always great to have you from the Chicago Sun times.
[02:06:16.260 --> 02:06:18.460]   What a great team we have on this show.
[02:06:18.460 --> 02:06:21.180]   We do Mac Break Weekly every Tuesday, 11 a.m. Pacific,
[02:06:21.180 --> 02:06:22.820]   2 p.m. Eastern time.
[02:06:22.820 --> 02:06:24.820]   That's 1900 UTC if you're watching
[02:06:24.820 --> 02:06:25.780]   anywhere around the world.
[02:06:25.780 --> 02:06:27.620]   That's the live version.
[02:06:27.620 --> 02:06:30.620]   It's probably a little confusing to people
[02:06:30.620 --> 02:06:31.540]   'cause it kind of looks like this
[02:06:31.540 --> 02:06:33.100]   might be like a television station.
[02:06:33.100 --> 02:06:34.780]   Basically what we do is we turn on the cameras
[02:06:34.780 --> 02:06:37.020]   and you can watch as we produce the shows.
[02:06:37.020 --> 02:06:38.540]   There's stuff before and after,
[02:06:38.540 --> 02:06:40.540]   sometimes produced, sometimes haphazard,
[02:06:40.540 --> 02:06:43.620]   sometimes just a long shot of the studio sitting there.
[02:06:43.620 --> 02:06:45.260]   But if you do wanna watch live,
[02:06:45.260 --> 02:06:46.260]   we love having you here
[02:06:46.260 --> 02:06:47.740]   'cause that's the only way you can interact directly
[02:06:47.740 --> 02:06:50.660]   with us via our chatroom at IRC.twit.tv.
[02:06:50.660 --> 02:06:52.740]   If you can't be here live, that's fine.
[02:06:52.740 --> 02:06:55.420]   We have on demand of all of our shows,
[02:06:55.420 --> 02:06:56.820]   audio and video available.
[02:06:56.820 --> 02:06:58.940]   In this case at twit.tv, our website,
[02:06:58.940 --> 02:07:02.340]   twit.tv/mbw for Mac Break Weekly.
[02:07:02.340 --> 02:07:03.940]   Or look for Mac Break Weekly.
[02:07:03.940 --> 02:07:06.340]   Since this is one of the oldest podcasts in the universe,
[02:07:06.340 --> 02:07:07.820]   almost 10 years old,
[02:07:07.820 --> 02:07:09.940]   I'm sure you can find a copy anywhere,
[02:07:09.940 --> 02:07:11.820]   podcasts are aggregated,
[02:07:11.820 --> 02:07:14.780]   or use our great twit apps on iOS
[02:07:14.780 --> 02:07:16.460]   and Android and Windows Phone.
[02:07:16.460 --> 02:07:17.300]   Thanks for being here.
[02:07:17.300 --> 02:07:18.340]   Now back to work 'cause you know what,
[02:07:18.340 --> 02:07:19.940]   Break time is over.
[02:07:19.940 --> 02:07:22.520]   (upbeat music)
[02:07:22.520 --> 02:07:25.100]   (upbeat music)
[02:07:25.100 --> 02:07:27.680]   (upbeat music)
[02:07:27.680 --> 02:07:30.260]   (upbeat music)
