[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly as we get ready for Apple's third quarter results.
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.400]   We'll talk about what to look for, what to expect, what might happen.
[00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.500]   Apple's buying Intel's modem business for a billion dollars.
[00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:15.500]   Is it the bargain of the year and a 16 inch MacBook Pro?
[00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:16.800]   What would you like to see?
[00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.000]   It's all coming up next.
[00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.200]   Mac Break Weekly.

[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.500]   This is Mac Break Weekly, episode 672.
[00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:40.000]   Recorded Tuesday July 30th, 2019.
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000]   Your third slice of lasagna.
[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.500]   Mac Break Weekly is brought to you by World Wide Technology.

[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.500]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly, the show we cover the latest news from Apple,
[00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:39.000]   and we better get going because I guess Apple's quarterly results coming out.
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000]   Lori Gill, are you going to be transcribing today?
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.000]   I am.
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   And Micah actually taught me how to properly transcribe, so I'm taking over from Micah.
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   He used to do such a fantastic job for us, and I really miss having him around.
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   He's actually a little giddy.
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000]   He's wandering around the studio because we hired him.
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   And he's a little giddy, not having to do that.
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000]   He's like, oh.
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   So happy.
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000]   Well, we'll get you out of here.
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   What time do we need to get you out of here?
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   By 1.30 after the markets close, is that?
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   That would be perfect.
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   Yeah.
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   Okay.
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   Yeah.
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   Lori, of course, managing editor imore.com, where they're coverage of the Apple and earnings call will be very detailed and precise.
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   And of course, Renee Richie will also be part of that coverage.
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   He is at iMore as well.
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   Hello, Renee.
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   Hi, Leo.
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   I managed to be so terrible at transcribing that neither Srinid or Lori will let me do it.
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   So I'm just going to go through the conference call afterwards and then yell about it on video.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   Have you guys considered using something like Otter AI to transcribe it or is that too inaccurate?
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   We're using, I'm using Trent.
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   So you are using something.
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   So you are using a service to do that.
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   There's something that actually uses humans.
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   I absolutely cannot type fast enough to transcribe myself.
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   I never learned the shorthand typing.
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   I can't remember what it's called now.
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   Serenity could.
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   That was the odd thing is you would just see her even live at the talk show at WWDC typing with a blurred fingers.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   She paid attention in Secretarial class.
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   Yeah.
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   Andy and I go, he and I will be eating Subway sandwiches and watching the TV tonight.
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   How you doing, Andy?
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   Well, if you don't keep up your great shorthand, you lose those skills.
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   I've been way too much time between the ages of nine and 14 at shorthand camp every single year.
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   I do deeply regret not learning shorthand.
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   That actually would be a useful skill, wouldn't it?
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   It's a lost art.
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   A lot of people do it.
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:39.000]   Really?
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   And the court reporters are doing some sort of, they have some sort of courting keyboard, right?
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   That lets them do it fast.
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   Yeah.
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   I'd love to know.
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   She's doing all an emoji.
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   Both things an emoji.
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   Okay, that's your assignment, Laurie.
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   This year, this quarter, we want Apple's results in emoji.
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.000]   I don't care.
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   Jeremy Burgess could do it.
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   There will be some happy faces, but Apple is, analysts are expecting a down quarter for,
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:15.000]   in fact, they'll be watching, I think this afternoon with interest to see how far down iPhone sales will go, right?
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   Yeah, well, it's a low quarter for them anyway because it is as far away from iPhone sales in September.
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:29.000]   I think we start to get into the real downward spiral on sales before they ramp up again for September.
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   So it's, it's seldom if ever a blowout quarter, but now that the phone market is so mature, that's a nice way of saying saturated,
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   it'll be mostly, I think, about projections for next quarter.
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:46.000]   And so where Apple lands compared to what the preconceptions of the market is and then what they guide for next quarter?
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:47.000]   That's the key.
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   So this is Mark Gurman writing in Bloomberg.
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:05:01.000]   He says, Apple reports fiscal third quarter today, but what people are going to be paying closest attention to is their forecast for next quarter because, of course, that's the next iPhone quarter.
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:05.000]   The other thing people will be looking at is services because services are year round now.
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   Apple had a 16% bump in services last quarter.
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.000]   Anything less than that will be seen as a downturn.
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   Yeah.
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:13.000]   Knowing the market.
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:21.000]   Well, also, this is a good opportunity for them to distract from what is traditionally, as Renee said, a down quarter by saying, and we're looking for fast-fars projections.
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:25.000]   We're looking forward to the launch of our new TV product.
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:31.000]   We're looking forward to the launch of exciting new technologies, unannounced technologies in the fourth quarter of this year.
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:37.000]   So when there's need for distraction, that's when Apple kind of bends.
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.000]   It's we do not comment on an announced products policy.
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:47.000]   I would imagine people will be listening for Tim Cook or Luca Maestry's comments on two news stories.
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:55.000]   One, of course, President Trump saying Apple will not get a break on tariffs.
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   He said that on Friday, so there'll be some interest, I'm sure, from the analysts about how that's going to affect iPhone and iPhone costs.
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.000]   That tariff will affect, in other words, the iPhone.
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   Yeah.
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000]   But if they don't say it, he might not remember.
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:11.000]   I mean, it's a gamble either way.
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.000]   Yeah, it might be best just to forget it.
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.000]   Because he's so mercurial that you don't know.
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:17.000]   Absolutely.
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   And he's got bigger fish to fry.
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:25.000]   And the investors aren't mercurial either.
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:38.000]   Tim Cook might have to address the idea that for a lot of reasons, not just Trump, it's a good, that a lot of companies are trying to at least experimentally move some manufacturing into the United States, not for a, "Hey, America, woohoo!"
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:49.000]   But in a way of reducing reliance on Chinese manufacturing, even if they're moving to India, even if they're moving to Singapore, there's a lot of interest in shareholders in saying, "What's going on?"
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:59.000]   Or holders in saying, "What if economic relations with China totally tank in the next two or three years, not just because of Trump, but because of other indicators?
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   How are you going to continue to be able to manufacture these phones that are still in decline?"
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:07.000]   And what's wrong with America, woohoo?
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   Well, let's bring some jobs back.
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.000]   But Apple's doing the exact opposite.
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.000]   They aren't going to make the Mac Pro in Texas.
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.000]   They're going to make it in China.
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   If they build factories, they're going to build them in the US. I don't think anybody's expecting that.
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:23.000]   They should just apply the PR game because all they want is a good press release.
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   So if they said, "Yeah, we're not going to make the Mac Pro here, but we're moving Magic Mouse Assembly to Texas."
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:29.000]   Exactly.
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000]   And you get a press release out of it. Everybody's happy.
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   And everybody's happy.
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:33.000]   Yeah.
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:40.000]   Is it really inconceivable that Apple would start making its stuff in the US? Is that just not?
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:47.000]   I don't have a trade. We don't have like the, again, a full story before, but my grandfather came here in the 1980s.
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:53.000]   And he was hired immediately because he was a metal worker, and they just did not have enough metal workers to make frigates for the Canadian Navy.
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:59.000]   And they were desperate to get them. And our trade school program just cratered over the last couple decades,
[00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:02.000]   whereas China and other countries have ramped those up.
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:06.000]   And they have people who are highly skilled at making exactly the kinds of things Apple needs made.
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.000]   And you cannot hire those kinds of people in quantity in North America.
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:14.000]   It doesn't mean you'll never be able to, but we've shown no signs of sort of ramping up that Apple wanted to.
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:23.000]   They could have. I mean, they, in any degrees in 2007, when they went to Shenzhen, they had to develop skills, develop machines.
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   They had to put a lot of money into Shenzhen to make it possible to make the iPhone in quantity.
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000]   But they didn't do it.
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:37.000]   Well, but it's important to remember that they had the backing of the Chinese government who early on recognized the value of the Chinese labor force.
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:44.000]   And on the international stage. Whereas over here, there's a lot of lip service being paid to creating jobs in America,
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:52.000]   but there's more fealty to large corporations who don't want to have to pay penalties for cheaper labor and cheaper manufacturing overseas.
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:09:01.000]   Meanwhile, you have consumers that if you have product day that's $50 more, but there is the most brilliantly written tag on it
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:07.000]   with pictures of happy American workers saying, here's how much, here's where $50 is going to.
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:11.000]   We are paying more money for labor because we're doing it domestically.
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:14.000]   Also, we are complying with United States labor laws.
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:19.000]   We are also not interfering with our workers ability and choice to unionize.
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:23.000]   And we are paying them a decent living wage and we're paying the decent benefits.
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:28.000]   This is why this is why this device is going to cost you 5% more than the competitor.
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.000]   They're not even going to bother to read it.
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.000]   They're just going to go through one of the stupid things.
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:36.000]   People are so price competitive.
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:41.000]   You couldn't make the patriotic case that, hey, you're supporting America by American.
[00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.000]   I mean, it feels like we could make that.
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:44.000]   I think you could put it in this case.
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:50.000]   There was a time when you could use that by America.
[00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:51.000]   I mean, I think I remember it.
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.000]   People bought American cars. Remember that?
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:56.000]   People say, we're not going to buy a Japanese car.
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:59.000]   We're going to buy American cars, even if they're not as good.
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:04.000]   The global ecosystem has changed so much.
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:08.000]   The world is just a lot different.
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:16.000]   I don't think that you can be so patriotic without running the risk of alienating people,
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.000]   like industries in other countries.
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:22.000]   There was a long time ago we started outsourcing to other countries,
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:25.000]   which seemed like a benefit because it helped reduce the cost.
[00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:28.000]   But now we're in this new globalized world.
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:33.000]   It's even more than just whether or not you should bring those jobs back to the US
[00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:40.000]   and support our US labor laws and give them benefits and living wages and things like that.
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:46.000]   There's so many other aspects to it that I think make it difficult for companies to come back to the US when they left.
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:51.000]   I don't think it's just as simple as the bottom line dollar amount.
[00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:57.000]   I think there's a lot of little ins and outs that I think there is a chance that
[00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:04.000]   cultural sentiment in the US could lean toward, let's bring jobs back to the US.
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:08.000]   If you don't start doing that, we're going to stop buying your devices.
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:13.000]   That could cause these companies to make these welfare decisions for the United States.
[00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:16.000]   But it really does come from the outside in there.
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:21.000]   There needs to be a cultural shift that makes these corporations look down and go,
[00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:24.000]   "Okay, this is what this country wants.
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:30.000]   So this is what we're going to do to make us look good, to have a good PR and stuff like that."
[00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:34.000]   It really is bigger than just what a company decides to do.
[00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:38.000]   I do feel like it's to become gospel that you can't make them in America.
[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:39.000]   I wonder if that really is the truth.
[00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.000]   There's a couple of things we'd have to add though.
[00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:46.000]   If I was running North America and I wanted to make it a powerhouse in this,
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:49.000]   I would give everyone who wanted it three, three years of trade school.
[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:50.000]   You need to do trade out of high school.
[00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:51.000]   Sure.
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:55.000]   I would take an entire state and turn it into an economic zone
[00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:57.000]   and have every factory next door to each other.
[00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:01.000]   So like in San Jen, you can go create a chassis place to the glass place.
[00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.000]   Is it that we don't really want those jobs?
[00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:06.000]   Is it that those jobs would go unfiltered?
[00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.000]   Because Americans don't want them.
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:09.000]   Yeah.
[00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:11.000]   You want to say we want them.
[00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:12.000]   Yeah.
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:17.000]   But the big stopping block is always going to be the companies have to hire these people.
[00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:20.000]   You can train people up as much as you want.
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.000]   But so long as they're going to demand a living wage,
[00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:27.000]   long as they're going to demand health benefits and the ability to, if you are.
[00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:28.000]   Fine.
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:29.000]   Fine.
[00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:34.000]   Well, I don't have a whole lot of faith in corporations doing anything
[00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:37.000]   that they are not being absolutely legally forced to do.
[00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.000]   Well, and it's also a season out.
[00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.000]   Or the market has to be done.
[00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.000]   The market, maybe government or the market.
[00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:44.000]   That's...
[00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:45.000]   We can as consumers, we can say.
[00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:46.000]   Yeah, that's right.
[00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:47.000]   We got it.
[00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:48.000]   We got to start making it here.
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.000]   Well, if I could be a major, major, major, major, major.
[00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:55.200]   You can legislate it like India legislates that you, or Brazil, that you pay such high
[00:12:55.200 --> 00:12:56.200]   duty if you don't make it there.
[00:12:56.200 --> 00:12:57.200]   Yeah, that's why those...
[00:12:57.200 --> 00:13:01.400]   By the way, that's why Foxconn has factories in Brazil and India.
[00:13:01.400 --> 00:13:03.000]   And Wisconsin, but we're not going to talk about it.
[00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:04.000]   No, they don't.
[00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:07.000]   They do not have an factory in Wisconsin.
[00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:09.000]   They have a sign that says Wisconsin.
[00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:10.000]   They have coming soon.
[00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:14.600]   They have a beautiful, they have a state of the art facility that manufactures compliance
[00:13:14.600 --> 00:13:17.160]   with regulations.
[00:13:17.160 --> 00:13:19.600]   With other tenants, I believe, still in residence.
[00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:20.600]   Yeah.
[00:13:20.600 --> 00:13:25.000]   The other story that will be, of course, on the analyst's minds is Apple's announcement
[00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:28.920]   that is spending $1 billion money it has.
[00:13:28.920 --> 00:13:30.920]   It's probably in the seat cushions.
[00:13:30.920 --> 00:13:35.200]   That's $1 billion that it could spend on domestic labor and benefit.
[00:13:35.200 --> 00:13:39.600]   Oh, it's going to buy Intel's modem parts.
[00:13:39.600 --> 00:13:41.200]   That's $2,000 labor.
[00:13:41.200 --> 00:13:45.000]   It's a P and 2,000, bringing 2,000 Intel employees.
[00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:46.000]   That's a good thing.
[00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.800]   Those are all working in the US, aren't they?
[00:13:48.800 --> 00:13:49.800]   Germany.
[00:13:49.800 --> 00:13:51.800]   Yeah, Germany's close.
[00:13:51.800 --> 00:13:52.800]   Okay.
[00:13:52.800 --> 00:13:53.800]   Germany's close.
[00:13:53.800 --> 00:13:54.800]   Well, it was in Phineon.
[00:13:54.800 --> 00:13:59.280]   So when Apple first started making iPhones, they used Infineon modems and that was a German
[00:13:59.280 --> 00:14:01.200]   company and then Intel bought them.
[00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:02.200]   Intel bought them.
[00:14:02.200 --> 00:14:03.680]   So Intel took over the Infineon business.
[00:14:03.680 --> 00:14:06.400]   So when Apple ran from Qualcomm, they went back to using Infineon.
[00:14:06.400 --> 00:14:10.400]   Yeah, it has been like a domino effect from day one.
[00:14:10.400 --> 00:14:14.000]   So Qualcomm and Apple get in a fight.
[00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.400]   Apple says, we're not going to pay you anymore.
[00:14:16.400 --> 00:14:19.000]   Qualcomm says, we're suing you.
[00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:20.800]   Apple says, we don't want your modems.
[00:14:20.800 --> 00:14:22.800]   Apple, we'll sue you right back.
[00:14:22.800 --> 00:14:29.880]   Jeff Williams of a COO at Apple makes a call to the CEO of probably Brian Crazanich at
[00:14:29.880 --> 00:14:34.080]   the time of Intel and says, you better make some 5G modems.
[00:14:34.080 --> 00:14:35.080]   We need them now.
[00:14:35.080 --> 00:14:36.080]   You heard your name.
[00:14:36.080 --> 00:14:37.760]   Intel says, we don't want to.
[00:14:37.760 --> 00:14:38.760]   We don't want to.
[00:14:38.760 --> 00:14:39.760]   Okay.
[00:14:39.760 --> 00:14:41.160]   They buy Infineon.
[00:14:41.160 --> 00:14:42.800]   They staff up.
[00:14:42.800 --> 00:14:43.800]   It's a struggle.
[00:14:43.800 --> 00:14:45.200]   It's not going well.
[00:14:45.200 --> 00:14:50.520]   At some point, somebody from Intel called Jeff and said, you know those modems, we're
[00:14:50.520 --> 00:14:52.000]   not going to have them by 2021.
[00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:53.760]   You can get to 4.25 G.
[00:14:53.760 --> 00:14:56.280]   Yeah, we're not going to have them.
[00:14:56.280 --> 00:15:02.600]   Apple goes to the court and says, your honor, we buried the hatchet.
[00:15:02.600 --> 00:15:06.360]   We love Qualcomm and makes a deal for five years of Qualcomm modems because Intel can't
[00:15:06.360 --> 00:15:08.080]   deliver.
[00:15:08.080 --> 00:15:12.520]   Well, like an hour later says, oh, we're out of the 5G modem business.
[00:15:12.520 --> 00:15:16.120]   And then Apple buys all of Intel's IP and the engine.
[00:15:16.120 --> 00:15:20.840]   And licenses Qualcomm's IP so now they can fix the thing that was wrong with Intel.
[00:15:20.840 --> 00:15:22.160]   Or oh, so that's interesting.
[00:15:22.160 --> 00:15:24.840]   You see some of that Qualcomm stuff will make it make it make it.
[00:15:24.840 --> 00:15:25.840]   Oh, yeah.
[00:15:25.840 --> 00:15:26.840]   Yeah.
[00:15:26.840 --> 00:15:31.320]   So Apple has you have to buy until Qualcomm modems for five years, but even after the fact
[00:15:31.320 --> 00:15:32.920]   they'll still be given a little something.
[00:15:32.920 --> 00:15:33.920]   Yeah.
[00:15:33.920 --> 00:15:35.840]   So it's similar to what they did with ARM where they originally started getting reference
[00:15:35.840 --> 00:15:40.280]   designs, but they then they started using the IP to license to make their own designs.
[00:15:40.280 --> 00:15:44.560]   Here they're buying Qualcomm modems for next year's iPhones, but they also have licensed
[00:15:44.560 --> 00:15:49.120]   the rice to Qualcomm's IP and it's broad range and they could make a Qualcomm based photography
[00:15:49.120 --> 00:15:50.120]   if they wanted to.
[00:15:50.120 --> 00:15:52.120]   They have basically a rights to all of Qualcomm's IP.
[00:15:52.120 --> 00:15:57.880]   But a lot of those are the 5G patents that Qualcomm is donating to Fran.
[00:15:57.880 --> 00:16:01.600]   But once you have that master license, it is much easier to get those and integrate those
[00:16:01.600 --> 00:16:02.600]   with everything you're doing.
[00:16:02.600 --> 00:16:08.280]   So we'll likely see that transition over three, four years into Apple modems that use the
[00:16:08.280 --> 00:16:13.920]   core of the Infineon technology supplemented by the Qualcomm IP license, but with Apple's
[00:16:13.920 --> 00:16:15.240]   specific designs.
[00:16:15.240 --> 00:16:18.240]   And that lets them go from a thin modem, which they have now, which is sort of slapped on
[00:16:18.240 --> 00:16:23.600]   top of the SOC into making a combined single chip that has all that functionality.
[00:16:23.600 --> 00:16:28.240]   Or make special stuff because the big thing is like Qualcomm literally can't afford to
[00:16:28.240 --> 00:16:29.240]   make watch chips.
[00:16:29.240 --> 00:16:31.000]   They just bundle old phone chips.
[00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:34.880]   But Apple will pay whatever they need to make phone modems to make AirPod modems.
[00:16:34.880 --> 00:16:39.160]   So to let them make specific designs nor the company would spend money on.
[00:16:39.160 --> 00:16:47.240]   And according to 9 to 5 Mac, Intel had to take a fire sale price for their modems.
[00:16:47.240 --> 00:16:53.080]   This wasn't a billion dollars as much as that sounds like wasn't what Intel was hoping
[00:16:53.080 --> 00:16:54.580]   for for this.
[00:16:54.580 --> 00:16:59.200]   I think though there were other people in the bids, right?
[00:16:59.200 --> 00:17:03.960]   They closed bids two weeks before this was even a rumor.
[00:17:03.960 --> 00:17:07.280]   So that meant that there really wasn't a big bidding war.
[00:17:07.280 --> 00:17:11.000]   Otherwise they would have basically kept Apple's feet to the fire.
[00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:14.360]   Apple, they're worth more to Apple than they are to anybody else, clearly.
[00:17:14.360 --> 00:17:17.640]   Yeah, because Intel realized that they're only business.
[00:17:17.640 --> 00:17:19.480]   Their only real customer was going to be Apple.
[00:17:19.480 --> 00:17:24.640]   Once Apple aced them out, then they realized that there is we have, we're making some,
[00:17:24.640 --> 00:17:28.120]   our business is in so many different successful areas.
[00:17:28.120 --> 00:17:32.920]   We don't need or have the desire to keep bleeding into a brand new industry.
[00:17:32.920 --> 00:17:35.320]   That's going to require a great deal of compliance.
[00:17:35.320 --> 00:17:41.240]   It's going to require a great deal of new marketing, a great deal of new relationships.
[00:17:41.240 --> 00:17:42.720]   Why not just sell it?
[00:17:42.720 --> 00:17:46.400]   I don't think they took a loss, but they were more interested in making sure that they have
[00:17:46.400 --> 00:17:51.440]   this thing that is not terribly valuable on the open market, but is very valuable to Apple
[00:17:51.440 --> 00:17:53.640]   and making the best deal they could.
[00:17:53.640 --> 00:17:57.120]   I don't think they're crying over with over the deal they made.
[00:17:57.120 --> 00:17:58.120]   No, I doubt they are.
[00:17:58.120 --> 00:18:03.680]   Does the fact that the T-Mobile Sprint merger looks like it's going to go through, and that
[00:18:03.680 --> 00:18:05.720]   is all about 5G.
[00:18:05.720 --> 00:18:10.280]   Dish is going to become a new fourth cell phone network and start with 5G.
[00:18:10.280 --> 00:18:13.360]   They're not even going to bother with building an LTE network.
[00:18:13.360 --> 00:18:17.400]   That also must have put some pressure on Apple to get going with its 5G modem.
[00:18:17.400 --> 00:18:21.600]   I think Apple would have otherwise sat back and said, "We can wait a couple of years,"
[00:18:21.600 --> 00:18:25.200]   because there isn't really a lot of pressure to make a 5G phone yet.
[00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:28.360]   I think their planet was originally the 2020 phone.
[00:18:28.360 --> 00:18:30.360]   I don't think that's changed.
[00:18:30.360 --> 00:18:32.520]   They were hoping they would get it.
[00:18:32.520 --> 00:18:35.240]   See, that's contrary to the way Apple works.
[00:18:35.240 --> 00:18:37.280]   Usually Apple is the last to adopt a new technology.
[00:18:37.280 --> 00:18:39.080]   Well, they will be the last by then.
[00:18:39.080 --> 00:18:42.960]   Every Android manufacturer is going to roll it out by spring of next year.
[00:18:42.960 --> 00:18:43.960]   Which is silly because honestly-
[00:18:43.960 --> 00:18:45.840]   That may be Google, we don't know.
[00:18:45.840 --> 00:18:49.600]   There's all sorts of issues with 5G we were talking on Sunday about battery life, which
[00:18:49.600 --> 00:18:51.760]   at this point is terrible with 5G.
[00:18:51.760 --> 00:18:56.360]   Gwen experience, phone melted.
[00:18:56.360 --> 00:18:59.000]   There's also the issue of 5G not being available.
[00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:03.080]   If it is available in your neck of the woods, maybe very, very expensive.
[00:19:03.080 --> 00:19:09.000]   I don't know if consumers are going to be in 2020 saying, "Oh, I got to have a 5G phone."
[00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:10.680]   Yeah, that's exactly it.
[00:19:10.680 --> 00:19:15.800]   It's mostly, I think, the biggest impact is going to be for services and also for broadband
[00:19:15.800 --> 00:19:20.360]   companies who want to build up coverage that they would normally have to get pull rights
[00:19:20.360 --> 00:19:22.200]   or cable rights for.
[00:19:22.200 --> 00:19:26.800]   Because it's not just all the problems that Renee's talking about.
[00:19:26.800 --> 00:19:31.760]   It's not like 3G or LTE where you can put up one antenna or repurpose an antenna you
[00:19:31.760 --> 00:19:33.480]   already have 3G stuff on.
[00:19:33.480 --> 00:19:39.920]   You really are going to have to just throw a 5G bomb in the air that does nothing but
[00:19:39.920 --> 00:19:45.960]   penetration scatters, 5G stations on every single street corner, every single block.
[00:19:45.960 --> 00:19:47.360]   They just don't penetrate.
[00:19:47.360 --> 00:19:49.080]   They just don't propagate very well.
[00:19:49.080 --> 00:19:53.440]   So you're going to need to cover a wide area.
[00:19:53.440 --> 00:19:56.720]   You're going to need so many pieces of hardware to make that happen.
[00:19:56.720 --> 00:20:04.240]   And you're still delivering features that aren't necessarily going to convince consumers
[00:20:04.240 --> 00:20:07.320]   to upgrade their mobile plan.
[00:20:07.320 --> 00:20:13.160]   Now, it's certainly a feature that will get someone interested in saying, "Well, I will
[00:20:13.160 --> 00:20:20.280]   definitely buy this 5G-enabled security camera because I will not have to run a special
[00:20:20.280 --> 00:20:23.560]   internet cable or a special internet service out to this remote location.
[00:20:23.560 --> 00:20:27.000]   It can just access an network on its own.
[00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:32.080]   Or if there's a low latency sort of product that they need to get going on like a drone
[00:20:32.080 --> 00:20:37.680]   project or something that's a little bit more active than what you can get with normal 4G
[00:20:37.680 --> 00:20:39.800]   and LTE right now.
[00:20:39.800 --> 00:20:46.920]   That's going to work, but the idea of it being like the transition between 3G and 4G is just
[00:20:46.920 --> 00:20:47.920]   not going to be it.
[00:20:47.920 --> 00:20:49.520]   You're not going to be able to get faster.
[00:20:49.520 --> 00:20:52.640]   You're not going to necessarily get better TV out of it.
[00:20:52.640 --> 00:20:54.840]   You're not going to get better Netflix out of it.
[00:20:54.840 --> 00:21:00.360]   And there has yet to be the case of people wanting to stream at a very, very, very high
[00:21:00.360 --> 00:21:02.600]   rate to a phone yet.
[00:21:02.600 --> 00:21:06.960]   Games might change that, but 5G availability is going to be a problem.
[00:21:06.960 --> 00:21:11.320]   So we'll still be able to make modems for PCs for other devices, just not phones.
[00:21:11.320 --> 00:21:14.960]   The other thing to remember though is that 5G is like it's a huge mess.
[00:21:14.960 --> 00:21:18.160]   It's like Andy was saying is a way bigger mess in LTE because it's also not really
[00:21:18.160 --> 00:21:19.160]   a thing.
[00:21:19.160 --> 00:21:21.160]   It's like three different things.
[00:21:21.160 --> 00:21:24.840]   There's sub-6 gigahertz which is what's going to be in rural communities and suburbs,
[00:21:24.840 --> 00:21:28.360]   which is going to use a lot of existing infrastructure and be just a little bit faster at first,
[00:21:28.360 --> 00:21:30.120]   but steadily gain speed.
[00:21:30.120 --> 00:21:33.880]   And then Europe has the mid-range sort of version of 5G.
[00:21:33.880 --> 00:21:39.080]   And then in cities it has the millimeter wave which is that cluster bomb that Andy was
[00:21:39.080 --> 00:21:40.280]   talking about.
[00:21:40.280 --> 00:21:44.800]   That's going to take at least a mini tower on every block, if not on every balcony in
[00:21:44.800 --> 00:21:47.720]   a major city just to provide distribution.
[00:21:47.720 --> 00:21:52.680]   And we'll probably see sub-6 gigahertz phones, especially low-cost phones, especially in
[00:21:52.680 --> 00:21:57.600]   markets like China, that won't require as much, people have slightly better service
[00:21:57.600 --> 00:21:59.080]   much faster.
[00:21:59.080 --> 00:22:01.680]   But for the North American market, you're probably going to have to support both.
[00:22:01.680 --> 00:22:05.280]   And that was the Mingshi Quo rumor this week is that Apple is going to go all in with
[00:22:05.280 --> 00:22:07.200]   all three phones in 2020.
[00:22:07.200 --> 00:22:08.600]   Awesome 5G.
[00:22:08.600 --> 00:22:09.600]   Wow.
[00:22:09.600 --> 00:22:10.600]   Wow.
[00:22:10.600 --> 00:22:11.600]   Yeah.
[00:22:11.600 --> 00:22:14.200]   So you'll buy one even if you don't need it or can't use it.
[00:22:14.200 --> 00:22:17.440]   Well, the modems will be still a generation or two later.
[00:22:17.440 --> 00:22:19.480]   So the modems will be way more energy efficient than they are now.
[00:22:19.480 --> 00:22:24.400]   They won't require as much RF and they won't generate the money heat that we saw again
[00:22:24.400 --> 00:22:26.760]   with Joanna Stern, where she had to basically put it on an ice pack.
[00:22:26.760 --> 00:22:30.080]   It was going to melt down to the thermal sort center of the earth.
[00:22:30.080 --> 00:22:31.080]   Geez, Louise.
[00:22:31.080 --> 00:22:33.160]   All right, let's take a little break.
[00:22:33.160 --> 00:22:38.160]   When we come back, I want to talk about an experience I had, I turned on Bluetooth as
[00:22:38.160 --> 00:22:42.680]   I drove around town the other day, I was trying to pair my phone to my helmet and I
[00:22:42.680 --> 00:22:47.000]   was, you could, this is a great, as one does.
[00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:51.720]   This is a great experiment though, just to get on a bike or walk around with a scanning
[00:22:51.720 --> 00:22:58.440]   for Bluetooth, you will be blown away by all the things you can join in your neighborhood.
[00:22:58.440 --> 00:23:03.600]   But first, and we'll talk a little bit about why that is, but first, a word from our sponsor,
[00:23:03.600 --> 00:23:09.200]   worldwide technology, WWT, these guys have been around for at least a decade.
[00:23:09.200 --> 00:23:12.360]   I know there's many people who have been customers for that whole time.
[00:23:12.360 --> 00:23:17.880]   In fact, about 10 years ago, I think they saw an opportunity.
[00:23:17.880 --> 00:23:21.400]   They're a great enterprise integrator vendor.
[00:23:21.400 --> 00:23:26.680]   They are, their engineers work closely with their clients to help businesses integrate
[00:23:26.680 --> 00:23:28.440]   technology into their business.
[00:23:28.440 --> 00:23:31.520]   Of course, this has been the most amazing decade for that.
[00:23:31.520 --> 00:23:38.600]   I think they saw early on that there was going to be a need for a place to put together different
[00:23:38.600 --> 00:23:40.920]   technologies to test them.
[00:23:40.920 --> 00:23:45.160]   That's when they started building their advanced technology center.
[00:23:45.160 --> 00:23:46.720]   There was already a gap in the market.
[00:23:46.720 --> 00:23:51.080]   Zif Davis had its big testing center in Foster City, but they shut that down.
[00:23:51.080 --> 00:23:53.000]   There was nobody doing this.
[00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:59.480]   They started building the ATC 10 years ago, and now it has grown like something else,
[00:23:59.480 --> 00:24:03.680]   like no other testing and research lab in the world, more than half a billion dollars
[00:24:03.680 --> 00:24:04.680]   in equipment.
[00:24:04.680 --> 00:24:07.520]   They say Silicon Valley has come to St. Louis.
[00:24:07.520 --> 00:24:14.920]   They're ATC headquarters, hundreds of OEMs, the big guys like Cisco and NetApp and VMware,
[00:24:14.920 --> 00:24:19.960]   emerging disruptors like Tanium and Equinix and Expanse.
[00:24:19.960 --> 00:24:26.000]   If you're in the market, if you're a business and you're looking to install new technologies
[00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:27.360]   and you want to know, how's this going to work?
[00:24:27.360 --> 00:24:29.400]   How's it going to work with my existing technologies?
[00:24:29.400 --> 00:24:34.960]   WWT and their advanced technology center is there for you.
[00:24:34.960 --> 00:24:41.520]   Their own engineers have been using this to test environments, to spin up proofs of concept,
[00:24:41.520 --> 00:24:43.200]   to create pilots.
[00:24:43.200 --> 00:24:49.080]   They have a sandbox their customers can look at how it works confidently, select the best
[00:24:49.080 --> 00:24:51.360]   solution, but here's the best part.
[00:24:51.360 --> 00:24:52.760]   Now you can use it too.
[00:24:52.760 --> 00:24:59.920]   They offer the ATC lab as a service, a dedicated lab space within the advanced technology center,
[00:24:59.920 --> 00:25:03.760]   where you can perform programmatic testing.
[00:25:03.760 --> 00:25:08.560]   If you're in the market for something from NetApp or Cisco or VMware or you've got existing
[00:25:08.560 --> 00:25:13.840]   products, you want to see how other products like Cisco's umbrella will interact with it.
[00:25:13.840 --> 00:25:16.840]   You can do that right in the lab.
[00:25:16.840 --> 00:25:17.840]   It's virtual.
[00:25:17.840 --> 00:25:22.160]   St. Louis, you can take advantage of the ATC's benefits from anywhere in the world.
[00:25:22.160 --> 00:25:24.120]   24/7.
[00:25:24.120 --> 00:25:29.400]   This is such a fantastic, fantastic product.
[00:25:29.400 --> 00:25:32.840]   WWT's engineers work in these labs every day.
[00:25:32.840 --> 00:25:34.080]   They beta test new equipment.
[00:25:34.080 --> 00:25:38.160]   They build reference architectures, custom integrations to help their customers make
[00:25:38.160 --> 00:25:41.400]   decisions and see results with much less investment.
[00:25:41.400 --> 00:25:42.400]   And now you can too.
[00:25:42.400 --> 00:25:47.720]   Later this summer, World Wide Tech is going to launch a new digital platform with a hands-on
[00:25:47.720 --> 00:25:51.400]   access to more than 200 lab environments.
[00:25:51.400 --> 00:25:57.320]   If you go to this page, www.t.com/twit, you can sign up for pre-launch access.
[00:25:57.320 --> 00:25:59.480]   You can try it right now.
[00:25:59.480 --> 00:26:03.000]   Their new on-demand lab platform.
[00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:08.240]   Really, really, this is something much needed in the world and I commend WWT for putting
[00:26:08.240 --> 00:26:09.480]   this together.
[00:26:09.480 --> 00:26:16.480]   The World Wide Technology simplifies the complex.
[00:26:16.480 --> 00:26:18.480]   WWT.com/twit.
[00:26:18.480 --> 00:26:22.600]   WWT delivers business and technology outcomes all over the world.
[00:26:22.600 --> 00:26:25.920]   And now you can do it without leaving your office.
[00:26:25.920 --> 00:26:31.320]   WWT.com/twit for pre-launch access.
[00:26:31.320 --> 00:26:35.320]   Actually I did this little ride around on my bicycle.
[00:26:35.320 --> 00:26:39.880]   I have a Bluetooth enabled helmet and I had my iPhone hadn't been paired to it yet.
[00:26:39.880 --> 00:26:44.160]   So foolishly, instead of stopping pairing it and then going on the ride, I'm on the ride.
[00:26:44.160 --> 00:26:51.000]   I want to pair it because I got to hear the Harry Potter sounds in my helmet.
[00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:55.040]   So I turned on scan for, you know, as one does, the scan for Bluetooth and I pressed
[00:26:55.040 --> 00:26:57.360]   the button on the helmet and says pairing.
[00:26:57.360 --> 00:26:58.760]   I couldn't believe it.
[00:26:58.760 --> 00:27:00.720]   I could see people's stereo systems.
[00:27:00.720 --> 00:27:01.720]   There's cars.
[00:27:01.720 --> 00:27:03.120]   I could see the refrigerators.
[00:27:03.120 --> 00:27:10.600]   I could see, it was by the end of a one mile route.
[00:27:10.600 --> 00:27:17.280]   I had hundreds of Bluetooth devices on my phone that I could have joined.
[00:27:17.280 --> 00:27:21.840]   Well now, now I just read this article shortly after I got back from Hexway.
[00:27:21.840 --> 00:27:26.320]   Apple Blee, we're talking about Bluetooth LE.
[00:27:26.320 --> 00:27:28.080]   Everyone knows what happens on your iPhone.
[00:27:28.080 --> 00:27:30.280]   And this is Apple's intent.
[00:27:30.280 --> 00:27:31.280]   It's beakening basically.
[00:27:31.280 --> 00:27:35.840]   In fact, didn't we read this or talk about this a few months ago?
[00:27:35.840 --> 00:27:40.000]   We were kind of surprised because Apple effectively said, Oh yeah, by the way, your iPad and your
[00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:42.840]   Mac book are beacons.
[00:27:42.840 --> 00:27:43.840]   Remember that beacons?
[00:27:43.840 --> 00:27:45.480]   For the fine my Mac for the fine my Mac.
[00:27:45.480 --> 00:27:46.480]   They're beacons.
[00:27:46.480 --> 00:27:53.160]   Yeah, that's when they announced WWDC find my well, yeah, it's beakening and it's sending
[00:27:53.160 --> 00:27:55.320]   a lot of information.
[00:27:55.320 --> 00:28:01.160]   But basically if Bluetooth is on on your Apple device, this will by the way prompt you to
[00:28:01.160 --> 00:28:03.000]   turn it off unless you need it.
[00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:07.760]   Nearly everyone nearby can see the current status of your device.
[00:28:07.760 --> 00:28:09.920]   Get info about your battery.
[00:28:09.920 --> 00:28:16.120]   Yes, device name your Wi-Fi status, your buffer availability, the version of your OS and maybe
[00:28:16.120 --> 00:28:18.880]   even your phone number.
[00:28:18.880 --> 00:28:24.160]   Now it takes a little work to get the phone number because that's hashed.
[00:28:24.160 --> 00:28:28.760]   You can create a hash database, run a script.
[00:28:28.760 --> 00:28:34.160]   Anytime somebody turns on airdrop, then you got them, by the way.
[00:28:34.160 --> 00:28:36.760]   Wow.
[00:28:36.760 --> 00:28:37.920]   This is not a bug.
[00:28:37.920 --> 00:28:40.000]   This is a feature.
[00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:44.680]   It's convenience over security.
[00:28:44.680 --> 00:28:46.080]   For me, it's a big problem.
[00:28:46.080 --> 00:28:48.320]   We have another story that we might get to today.
[00:28:48.320 --> 00:28:53.800]   I'm sure that this is why I really cringe when Apple really tries to play the card of,
[00:28:53.800 --> 00:28:57.040]   hey, we're different from other companies.
[00:28:57.040 --> 00:28:58.920]   They don't care about security.
[00:28:58.920 --> 00:29:04.200]   When you have an iPhone, you could be absolutely sure the threat phone is absolutely secure
[00:29:04.200 --> 00:29:06.000]   and nobody can get into it.
[00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:09.360]   Whether your privacy on your iPhone, it stays on your iPhone.
[00:29:09.360 --> 00:29:16.600]   And then, okay, let's set a Google News alert for Apple device security fail and see how
[00:29:16.600 --> 00:29:21.360]   many emails I get on that on a weekly basis.
[00:29:21.360 --> 00:29:26.240]   This isn't a tragedy and this isn't a scandal that we're finding out the stuff about or
[00:29:26.240 --> 00:29:34.000]   we're being reminded in this case about Bluetooth being Bluetooth and features that cannot possibly
[00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:35.000]   work otherwise.
[00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:37.640]   If you want to get your phone back, you want to get your...
[00:29:37.640 --> 00:29:40.520]   Well, they can't wait, I should say they can work otherwise.
[00:29:40.520 --> 00:29:45.040]   Android does not do this with no notice, we'll drop in convenience.
[00:29:45.040 --> 00:29:47.000]   So you don't have to do this.
[00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:52.800]   It's this Bluetooth LE thing that, remember, for a long time pairing was a pain in the ass.
[00:29:52.800 --> 00:29:56.320]   You had to turn on pairing one thing, you had to press the button, but Bluetooth LE
[00:29:56.320 --> 00:29:57.480]   eliminated all that, right?
[00:29:57.480 --> 00:29:59.040]   You could just see it.
[00:29:59.040 --> 00:30:01.720]   And that's what's happened is Bluetooth LE...
[00:30:01.720 --> 00:30:05.360]   Which says, "Caster discovered broadcasting."
[00:30:05.360 --> 00:30:07.560]   Android made the choice not to do that.
[00:30:07.560 --> 00:30:11.240]   So I don't think you have to do that, but I think you nailed it, Renee, when you say
[00:30:11.240 --> 00:30:15.800]   it's trading convenience over security.
[00:30:15.800 --> 00:30:17.800]   I'm John Lee Meiner, Steve Gibson.
[00:30:17.800 --> 00:30:18.800]   Yeah.
[00:30:18.800 --> 00:30:26.200]   I was on the airplane a couple of weeks ago and using my phone pairing.
[00:30:26.200 --> 00:30:32.120]   I think I was wearing my AirPods and someone else's AirPods on the plane popped up on my
[00:30:32.120 --> 00:30:33.280]   screen to pair with it.
[00:30:33.280 --> 00:30:35.280]   I thought that was really weird.
[00:30:35.280 --> 00:30:36.280]   It's not, I should say.
[00:30:36.280 --> 00:30:37.960]   What if I would have tried to...
[00:30:37.960 --> 00:30:41.080]   You could have played music into their AirPods is what you could have done.
[00:30:41.080 --> 00:30:45.760]   Yeah, it's not the end of the world, but it's not a good thing either.
[00:30:45.760 --> 00:30:47.640]   Windows does this too.
[00:30:47.640 --> 00:30:49.680]   Android has chosen not to.
[00:30:49.680 --> 00:30:50.920]   It is not just your iPhone.
[00:30:50.920 --> 00:30:51.920]   It is your Apple Watch.
[00:30:51.920 --> 00:30:53.520]   It is your AirPods.
[00:30:53.520 --> 00:30:55.040]   It is your MacBook.
[00:30:55.040 --> 00:30:57.760]   All of these do this.
[00:30:57.760 --> 00:31:03.760]   This is researchers at Boston University called this a security flaw and pointed it out in
[00:31:03.760 --> 00:31:06.960]   Windows iOS and Mac OS.
[00:31:06.960 --> 00:31:07.960]   Android does...
[00:31:07.960 --> 00:31:10.880]   It's really the difference between pushing and polling.
[00:31:10.880 --> 00:31:11.880]   Yep.
[00:31:11.880 --> 00:31:17.560]   BLE uses public non-encrypted advertising channels to announce their presence to nearby
[00:31:17.560 --> 00:31:19.200]   devices.
[00:31:19.200 --> 00:31:23.520]   Those channels can carry a lot of information.
[00:31:23.520 --> 00:31:31.080]   It doesn't work on Android because Android doesn't poll in that way.
[00:31:31.080 --> 00:31:35.720]   It does do advertising messages, but there's never any manufacturing specific data or device
[00:31:35.720 --> 00:31:39.600]   identifying data in there, according to the BU researchers.
[00:31:39.600 --> 00:31:42.640]   I don't know what the answer is.
[00:31:42.640 --> 00:31:46.360]   If you're not using Bluetooth, absolutely turn it off.
[00:31:46.360 --> 00:31:50.120]   I presume that turns off Bluetooth LE as well as everything else.
[00:31:50.120 --> 00:31:51.120]   Yes.
[00:31:51.120 --> 00:31:54.880]   I would prefer they didn't do it, but then like you said, it goes back to me.
[00:31:54.880 --> 00:31:59.600]   Right now, I'm going to use that M word, "magical," which I hate, but it does seem that way because
[00:31:59.600 --> 00:32:01.320]   the device is basically going, "Hey, here I am.
[00:32:01.320 --> 00:32:02.320]   I'm super easy to join.
[00:32:02.320 --> 00:32:03.320]   Just press that button.
[00:32:03.320 --> 00:32:04.320]   You'll join up.
[00:32:04.320 --> 00:32:05.320]   I'm going to go ahead.
[00:32:05.320 --> 00:32:06.320]   Here's a handshake.
[00:32:06.320 --> 00:32:08.600]   You're now everything's done, and it makes you really just press a button and it's done.
[00:32:08.600 --> 00:32:11.880]   When you take that away, you end up futzing with the connection at both ends, which is
[00:32:11.880 --> 00:32:12.880]   fine for me.
[00:32:12.880 --> 00:32:16.880]   I would absolutely make that trade in a heartbeat, give zero information and make me work to
[00:32:16.880 --> 00:32:17.880]   connect.
[00:32:17.880 --> 00:32:22.000]   I also realize that my preferences aren't everybody's preference.
[00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:25.000]   There is a red flag.
[00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:29.880]   It's really convenient, but when we were on vacation last week, by the way, thank you
[00:32:29.880 --> 00:32:31.720]   guys for...
[00:32:31.720 --> 00:32:32.720]   Who hosted?
[00:32:32.720 --> 00:32:33.720]   Did you host?
[00:32:33.720 --> 00:32:34.720]   Andy was brilliant.
[00:32:34.720 --> 00:32:35.720]   Thank you.
[00:32:35.720 --> 00:32:37.960]   Thank you for doing the job.
[00:32:37.960 --> 00:32:38.960]   I appreciate it.
[00:32:38.960 --> 00:32:43.800]   But while I was on vacation, there's a Wi-Fi there, and I paired my phone to it.
[00:32:43.800 --> 00:32:48.280]   Then lo and behold, my MacBook and my iPad automatically already know the password to
[00:32:48.280 --> 00:32:49.280]   the Bluetooth.
[00:32:49.280 --> 00:32:50.280]   That's great.
[00:32:50.280 --> 00:32:54.440]   That's really convenient, except if you think about it, what it means is it's being...
[00:32:54.440 --> 00:32:55.440]   Well, there's...
[00:32:55.440 --> 00:32:56.440]   It's like a sense.
[00:32:56.440 --> 00:32:57.440]   Go ahead.
[00:32:57.440 --> 00:32:58.920]   There's this idea of...
[00:32:58.920 --> 00:33:05.160]   I don't want to use this word fear-mongering, but this is different than somebody having
[00:33:05.160 --> 00:33:07.120]   gaining access to your personal data.
[00:33:07.120 --> 00:33:08.120]   Now, I agree that...
[00:33:08.120 --> 00:33:11.680]   Well, your phone number is your personal data.
[00:33:11.680 --> 00:33:15.600]   But we used to put our phone numbers in a phone book.
[00:33:15.600 --> 00:33:20.040]   It used to not be a problem that the world had access to my phone number.
[00:33:20.040 --> 00:33:24.280]   I was excited the first time I moved out on my own and got my phone number in the phone
[00:33:24.280 --> 00:33:25.280]   book.
[00:33:25.280 --> 00:33:33.080]   So even the idea that anyone could have access to it, that's not that big of a deal in the
[00:33:33.080 --> 00:33:39.160]   sort of grand scheme of things, when you relate it to something more personal, like
[00:33:39.160 --> 00:33:44.280]   your other personal data, like access to things right on your iPhone, your credit card numbers
[00:33:44.280 --> 00:33:45.360]   and things like that.
[00:33:45.360 --> 00:33:53.640]   So you do have to kind of balance this out a little bit that it is less secure.
[00:33:53.640 --> 00:34:00.680]   And Apple stands on its soapbox that it's so secure, but then they have this special convenient
[00:34:00.680 --> 00:34:02.200]   thing that makes it less secure.
[00:34:02.200 --> 00:34:03.840]   So you're 100% right.
[00:34:03.840 --> 00:34:09.760]   But there's also kind of this idea that we have to keep in mind is that it's not...
[00:34:09.760 --> 00:34:13.520]   There are some things that it's not that big of a deal that it's not that secure.
[00:34:13.520 --> 00:34:14.880]   Yeah, I agree.
[00:34:14.880 --> 00:34:16.760]   Secure enough is often secure.
[00:34:16.760 --> 00:34:18.760]   But it's...
[00:34:18.760 --> 00:34:24.040]   Sometimes you really do have to take the stance that I don't know what this information could
[00:34:24.040 --> 00:34:27.760]   be used for against me, but I'm going to assume that someone can use this against me.
[00:34:27.760 --> 00:34:29.760]   And so I want to be able to turn that off.
[00:34:29.760 --> 00:34:36.240]   In terms of a phone number, there's a big reason why so many services want you to attach
[00:34:36.240 --> 00:34:41.360]   a phone number to your account for safety and security and for verification of your
[00:34:41.360 --> 00:34:42.800]   account.
[00:34:42.800 --> 00:34:44.080]   That is true.
[00:34:44.080 --> 00:34:50.720]   But the thing is, companies know that the one piece of data that they can ask for that
[00:34:50.720 --> 00:34:57.680]   doesn't change from address to address from time of life to time of life is your cell phone
[00:34:57.680 --> 00:34:58.680]   number.
[00:34:58.680 --> 00:35:04.160]   I've had several addresses since the 90s.
[00:35:04.160 --> 00:35:11.080]   And if you've been tracking me on basic lots of different pieces of data that is accessible,
[00:35:11.080 --> 00:35:14.240]   you will probably have gotten all those stuff out of date.
[00:35:14.240 --> 00:35:17.320]   But my cell phone number has remained the same since the 1990s.
[00:35:17.320 --> 00:35:18.560]   That's why they wanted.
[00:35:18.560 --> 00:35:23.920]   And now that we have situations where you have companies that realize the value of just having
[00:35:23.920 --> 00:35:29.360]   a truck or a car, just driving around like a Google Street view car, collecting as much
[00:35:29.360 --> 00:35:34.400]   data from Open Wi-Fi from Bluetooth from any open channel as they can.
[00:35:34.400 --> 00:35:40.120]   Because at some point, if a government agency wants to thinks that you're harboring illegal
[00:35:40.120 --> 00:35:46.920]   aliens or illegal immigrants and wants to see, well, okay, where was Lori yesterday?
[00:35:46.920 --> 00:35:52.600]   And they couldn't, they couldn't, they needed a court order to get it through the most direct
[00:35:52.600 --> 00:35:54.960]   means through the phone company.
[00:35:54.960 --> 00:35:59.360]   But they could simply ask a private contractor who's again sending those cars around to do
[00:35:59.360 --> 00:36:03.480]   things like all that stuff and also scan license plates that are parked on the side of the
[00:36:03.480 --> 00:36:04.480]   streets.
[00:36:04.480 --> 00:36:09.440]   Where is it likely that Lori Gill is going to be on at 10 AM on a Thursday?
[00:36:09.440 --> 00:36:12.520]   And because they were able to ping your phone number, they got it.
[00:36:12.520 --> 00:36:14.000]   They can sell that information.
[00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:15.000]   So I'm not.
[00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:18.320]   >> But that's, we're also, we're giving all that information away and all the other things
[00:36:18.320 --> 00:36:19.520]   that we do too though.
[00:36:19.520 --> 00:36:25.880]   So when you sit in, and again, I am agreeing with all of this, but I also, there's also
[00:36:25.880 --> 00:36:28.520]   other things in the world that we're doing that with.
[00:36:28.520 --> 00:36:31.600]   The fact that I walked down the street to go get a cup of coffee at 10 o'clock in the
[00:36:31.600 --> 00:36:34.440]   morning, somebody already knows that and it has nothing to do with it.
[00:36:34.440 --> 00:36:35.440]   >> Thanks to face recognition.
[00:36:35.440 --> 00:36:36.440]   You're in a database.
[00:36:36.440 --> 00:36:37.440]   >> Yeah.
[00:36:37.440 --> 00:36:38.440]   >> Yeah.
[00:36:38.440 --> 00:36:47.440]   So to sort of center in on Bluetooth LE, when we have given up our privacy all over the
[00:36:47.440 --> 00:36:53.360]   world, or it's been taken from us depending on the angle that you want to look at it,
[00:36:53.360 --> 00:36:55.240]   it's much bigger than just Bluetooth.
[00:36:55.240 --> 00:36:58.920]   It goes beyond our phones.
[00:36:58.920 --> 00:37:03.000]   So to kind of like, I guess I just think about people listening to this right now who might
[00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:06.480]   be freaking out and who might be like, I got to turn off Bluetooth on my phone.
[00:37:06.480 --> 00:37:07.640]   I'm not saying don't do it.
[00:37:07.640 --> 00:37:13.200]   I'm just saying there's also a lot more out there in the world that we're not paying attention
[00:37:13.200 --> 00:37:14.200]   to.
[00:37:14.200 --> 00:37:16.560]   >> Well, but also if you don't have to do it.
[00:37:16.560 --> 00:37:21.360]   Nobody is saying, oh, Android, I hate how Bluetooth pairing on Android is.
[00:37:21.360 --> 00:37:23.840]   You don't have to send that information out.
[00:37:23.840 --> 00:37:28.200]   So I think this is a little pressure on Apple to maybe consider what it's sending out.
[00:37:28.200 --> 00:37:32.680]   >> It's also weird because when you look at the white paper and you see what they do
[00:37:32.680 --> 00:37:37.480]   architecturally, so for example, when they broadcast for airdrop, they don't send any
[00:37:37.480 --> 00:37:38.800]   personal information.
[00:37:38.800 --> 00:37:44.400]   They only send a unique identifier that is that if you or how my information then displays,
[00:37:44.400 --> 00:37:46.080]   yeah, the rest of it to you.
[00:37:46.080 --> 00:37:50.800]   I have to look more into this, but there has to be way like, I don't want to concede all
[00:37:50.800 --> 00:37:54.240]   the convenience because I recognize for a lot of mainstream people that convenience is
[00:37:54.240 --> 00:37:56.800]   what allows them to use technology in the first place.
[00:37:56.800 --> 00:37:59.360]   But I also don't want to concede that you can lock this stuff down way better.
[00:37:59.360 --> 00:38:00.560]   And they did that with Wi-Fi.
[00:38:00.560 --> 00:38:05.040]   Remember like stores were tracking us by just the Wi-Fi paying off of us walking around.
[00:38:05.040 --> 00:38:06.040]   >> Right.
[00:38:06.040 --> 00:38:07.040]   >> And so Apple started faking the Wi-Fi.
[00:38:07.040 --> 00:38:08.040]   >> I did, yes.
[00:38:08.040 --> 00:38:09.040]   And they do that.
[00:38:09.040 --> 00:38:10.040]   They rotate them across and stuff.
[00:38:10.040 --> 00:38:11.040]   They do some things right.
[00:38:11.040 --> 00:38:13.040]   Things that they're trying to do right.
[00:38:13.040 --> 00:38:14.040]   >> Yeah.
[00:38:14.040 --> 00:38:15.280]   And I'm not the engineer in charge implementing it.
[00:38:15.280 --> 00:38:19.040]   So it's easy for me to say, but I do believe they can come up with smart ways of fixing
[00:38:19.040 --> 00:38:20.040]   this without this idea.
[00:38:20.040 --> 00:38:24.760]   >> As long as we're talking about this was pile on because the folks that this is the
[00:38:24.760 --> 00:38:26.720]   other story Andy wanted to talk about.
[00:38:26.720 --> 00:38:34.800]   The folks at Google have pinpointed five, count them five flaws in Apple's iMessage software.
[00:38:34.800 --> 00:38:38.920]   Apple calls it the messages software, but I see the BBC has not got that memo yet.
[00:38:38.920 --> 00:38:44.440]   That could make its devices vulnerable to attack.
[00:38:44.440 --> 00:38:49.800]   >> These are problems that require no intervention on the part of the user.
[00:38:49.800 --> 00:38:52.640]   And that is always concerning.
[00:38:52.640 --> 00:38:53.640]   We don't know the details.
[00:38:53.640 --> 00:38:54.720]   There's a sixth problem.
[00:38:54.720 --> 00:39:01.240]   We don't know the details of it because it's the 90 days for disclosure, aren't up.
[00:39:01.240 --> 00:39:06.960]   And they're hoping Apple will fix this before the zero day Google zero team reveal.
[00:39:06.960 --> 00:39:10.960]   >> Sounded like about form messages would do some sort of buffer overflow and allow them
[00:39:10.960 --> 00:39:12.480]   into the system.
[00:39:12.480 --> 00:39:16.240]   >> In one case, researchers said the vulnerability was so severe that the only way to rescue a
[00:39:16.240 --> 00:39:20.360]   targeted iPhone would be to delete all the data often.
[00:39:20.360 --> 00:39:24.560]   Another example they said could be used to copy files off a device without requiring
[00:39:24.560 --> 00:39:27.840]   the owner to do anything.
[00:39:27.840 --> 00:39:34.520]   Apple fixed this in 12.4, but there is a sixth that is apparently not fixed yet.
[00:39:34.520 --> 00:39:40.900]   So this is Apple's own notes about 12.4 indicate the unfixed flaw could give hackers a means
[00:39:40.900 --> 00:39:45.720]   to crash and execute commands of their own on recent iPhones, iPads, and iPod touches
[00:39:45.720 --> 00:39:48.800]   if they were to discover it.
[00:39:48.800 --> 00:39:54.220]   Apple is not commented, but is urge users to install the new iOS version which addresses
[00:39:54.220 --> 00:39:57.600]   Google's other discoveries as well as other glitches and threats.
[00:39:57.600 --> 00:40:01.400]   So this is pretty typical Project Zero at Google.
[00:40:01.400 --> 00:40:02.400]   We'll discover these.
[00:40:02.400 --> 00:40:06.980]   We'll notify the manufacturer, give them 90 days to fix it after the 90 days are up.
[00:40:06.980 --> 00:40:08.580]   If the fixes are out there, we'll reveal it.
[00:40:08.580 --> 00:40:14.880]   In this case, Apple did make the deadline for those five flaws, but there's always others.
[00:40:14.880 --> 00:40:16.800]   There's always more.
[00:40:16.800 --> 00:40:17.800]   >> Yeah.
[00:40:17.800 --> 00:40:21.200]   And this isn't -- this is just what happens when you're building -- yeah.
[00:40:21.200 --> 00:40:24.680]   When you're building a piece of software with more than 80 lines of code, this is --
[00:40:24.680 --> 00:40:26.680]   >> Sometimes the need.
[00:40:26.680 --> 00:40:27.680]   >> Yeah, exactly.
[00:40:27.680 --> 00:40:28.680]   Okay.
[00:40:28.680 --> 00:40:29.680]   Yeah.
[00:40:29.680 --> 00:40:34.720]   I've built software with 40 lines of code that was even way more destructive than that by
[00:40:34.720 --> 00:40:35.720]   accident.
[00:40:35.720 --> 00:40:42.900]   Yeah, but it's -- I think there's a part of a basic consumer technology literacy that
[00:40:42.900 --> 00:40:44.180]   we need to build up.
[00:40:44.180 --> 00:40:52.620]   One of them is that this is unfortunately normal, that software and services are fallible.
[00:40:52.620 --> 00:40:59.180]   There are going to be problems that cannot be found unless you have the backing of a billion
[00:40:59.180 --> 00:41:04.940]   dollar corporation -- excuse me, a trillion dollar corporation that has an entire -- like
[00:41:04.940 --> 00:41:10.660]   basically an entire corporation that's dedicated to finding bugs in their own and other people's
[00:41:10.660 --> 00:41:11.660]   products.
[00:41:11.660 --> 00:41:16.700]   If you start to go through the world thinking that, so long as I haven't seen a product
[00:41:16.700 --> 00:41:24.700]   recall, my phone is pretty much safe, that's how you can maintain yourself as an informed
[00:41:24.700 --> 00:41:27.880]   consumer, as someone who is not going to get thrown off when they find out that there's
[00:41:27.880 --> 00:41:30.820]   been a hack involving Apple phones, you're going to have -- you're also going to be a
[00:41:30.820 --> 00:41:34.900]   little bit skeptical when any company says that -- like when Samsung says, "Hey, we've
[00:41:34.900 --> 00:41:39.140]   got this new face recognition first to market," and it's just a secure -- and it's perfectly
[00:41:39.140 --> 00:41:40.780]   secure and it's wonderful.
[00:41:40.780 --> 00:41:45.020]   That's when you're smarter to be skeptical to saying, "Okay, let's wait six months to
[00:41:45.020 --> 00:41:49.340]   see if -- oh, once it's out in the world, if it really is safe and secure."
[00:41:49.340 --> 00:41:53.660]   And when Apple puts out a big billboard bragging about their security and trying to dunk on
[00:41:53.660 --> 00:42:00.060]   other companies, that's -- with that sort of consumer electronics literacy, consumers
[00:42:00.060 --> 00:42:03.820]   are smarter to know that, "Okay, what we're seeing is an advertisement."
[00:42:03.820 --> 00:42:06.140]   And we all know how much we believe advertisements.
[00:42:06.140 --> 00:42:11.940]   And what I hate to see is people getting -- we're getting their heart broken over this, thinking
[00:42:11.940 --> 00:42:17.260]   that, "Oh, well, I think we've been deceived and we've been lied to," when, "No, this
[00:42:17.260 --> 00:42:21.980]   has always been the situation with anything that has a plastic heart and a pulse.
[00:42:21.980 --> 00:42:25.180]   There will be problems or we'll be security issues that are going to be found or are
[00:42:25.180 --> 00:42:28.740]   going to be your security issues that are not going to be found."
[00:42:28.740 --> 00:42:34.020]   And you just have to be -- you have to make sure you guard your heart against having too
[00:42:34.020 --> 00:42:37.300]   much faith in any company to keep you secure.
[00:42:37.300 --> 00:42:43.900]   And we will cover all of this out, put in a little plug, in about an hour on security
[00:42:43.900 --> 00:42:48.100]   now, because that has kept that show going for 15 years.
[00:42:48.100 --> 00:42:50.740]   And it's getting longer and longer.
[00:42:50.740 --> 00:42:54.500]   Steve's got more and more to do every week.
[00:42:54.500 --> 00:43:01.460]   Okay, one more. This one, though, I can safely say, don't worry too much about it.
[00:43:01.460 --> 00:43:06.020]   It wasn't so long ago we heard that Google Assistant sends its voice recordings to contractors
[00:43:06.020 --> 00:43:11.020]   for a review, that Amazon's Echo sends its recordings to contractors for review.
[00:43:11.020 --> 00:43:14.820]   And then use again today for the same thing, because we don't remember.
[00:43:14.820 --> 00:43:15.820]   Yeah.
[00:43:15.820 --> 00:43:17.220]   Siri does it too.
[00:43:17.220 --> 00:43:22.260]   And Apple's the latest in the, you know, crosshairs.
[00:43:22.260 --> 00:43:27.180]   The thing that's a problem with all three of these devices is not so much when you say,
[00:43:27.180 --> 00:43:33.500]   "Hey, Shlomo," and ask it something, is it that when it's triggered by accident?
[00:43:33.500 --> 00:43:40.260]   And according to ours, Technica Siri has recorded fights between people, business deals,
[00:43:40.260 --> 00:43:43.260]   criminal dealing, sexual encounters, and so on.
[00:43:43.260 --> 00:43:44.340]   This is a leaker.
[00:43:44.340 --> 00:43:48.980]   There have been countless instances of recordings featuring private discussions between doctors
[00:43:48.980 --> 00:43:51.060]   and patients.
[00:43:51.060 --> 00:43:54.420]   Because that's what happens with these things.
[00:43:54.420 --> 00:44:00.900]   Apple's response is, well, less than one, fewer than 1% of activations are reviewed.
[00:44:00.900 --> 00:44:06.260]   We have confidentially requirements for the contract workers who get those recordings.
[00:44:06.260 --> 00:44:10.220]   We listen to them in a secure environment.
[00:44:10.220 --> 00:44:13.580]   And frankly, this is how all of these voice assistants work.
[00:44:13.580 --> 00:44:15.380]   They have to work that way if you want to.
[00:44:15.380 --> 00:44:19.660]   The fascinating thing for me is that Bloomberg reported this back in April when they reported
[00:44:19.660 --> 00:44:22.020]   and they had a big paragraph saying, "Apple also does this.
[00:44:22.020 --> 00:44:23.020]   Blah, blah, blah, blah.
[00:44:23.020 --> 00:44:24.020]   Google also does this.
[00:44:24.020 --> 00:44:25.020]   Blah, blah, blah, blah.
[00:44:25.020 --> 00:44:26.020]   Nobody noticed.
[00:44:26.020 --> 00:44:27.020]   But nobody reacted.
[00:44:27.020 --> 00:44:28.020]   But then the Guardian runs the story.
[00:44:28.020 --> 00:44:31.820]   They put sex in the headline and it's after those privacy billboards that actually meant it.
[00:44:31.820 --> 00:44:32.820]   That's the key.
[00:44:32.820 --> 00:44:34.140]   And now it's like those two, the sex.
[00:44:34.140 --> 00:44:35.940]   And oh, you put up those billboards?
[00:44:35.940 --> 00:44:36.940]   Boom.
[00:44:36.940 --> 00:44:38.700]   That's the key.
[00:44:38.700 --> 00:44:40.700]   Anything to be worried about with this?
[00:44:40.700 --> 00:44:44.660]   I mean, obviously, if you don't want this to happen, you shouldn't have any of these devices.
[00:44:44.660 --> 00:44:46.380]   They should make it off.
[00:44:46.380 --> 00:44:49.820]   I mean, I'm loathe to say set up, but each should get more complicated than it already
[00:44:49.820 --> 00:44:50.820]   is.
[00:44:50.820 --> 00:44:52.620]   That's the thing that you go through when you set up a new iPhone.
[00:44:52.620 --> 00:44:54.300]   But they get on the Siri page.
[00:44:54.300 --> 00:44:57.900]   It should say, "We send 1% of our conversations to human."
[00:44:57.900 --> 00:45:00.780]   Well, first, I don't think they should be contractors.
[00:45:00.780 --> 00:45:04.180]   Again, easy for me to say because I'm not in charge of hiring back to the Apple.
[00:45:04.180 --> 00:45:07.740]   But I don't think it should ever be done by contractors only by actual employees of the
[00:45:07.740 --> 00:45:11.100]   company because that's how you prove accountability.
[00:45:11.100 --> 00:45:14.740]   And if you can get humans out of all but the most extreme cases by just using all that
[00:45:14.740 --> 00:45:16.300]   machine learning, that's even better.
[00:45:16.300 --> 00:45:19.620]   Minimize the scope of what they have to do as much as possible.
[00:45:19.620 --> 00:45:21.100]   And then disclose it on set up buddy.
[00:45:21.100 --> 00:45:28.540]   When you set up Yojimbo, you have a thing saying 0.1% of these are sent to humans to
[00:45:28.540 --> 00:45:30.660]   improve the quality of our service.
[00:45:30.660 --> 00:45:35.100]   And then have you hit that button so that nobody has to go digging through white papers
[00:45:35.100 --> 00:45:38.020]   or terms of service or anything.
[00:45:38.020 --> 00:45:40.460]   And they're absolutely clear about what's happening with their data.
[00:45:40.460 --> 00:45:44.300]   And if they don't want it, just opt them out of the analytics and keep going.
[00:45:44.300 --> 00:45:45.300]   Yeah.
[00:45:45.300 --> 00:45:52.820]   I think it would be really smart for Apple to include some sort of mute, slow-mo button.
[00:45:52.820 --> 00:45:58.420]   Oh, there is a mute button on most Echo and Google devices.
[00:45:58.420 --> 00:46:02.060]   Right on top of the speaker, it's a nice big button that you just push.
[00:46:02.060 --> 00:46:05.660]   And then you have this big red ring that reminds you that it's muted.
[00:46:05.660 --> 00:46:10.300]   And if Apple had that on all of its devices, something that's right to the forefront and
[00:46:10.300 --> 00:46:16.900]   it's very easy to access, even in control center, something really easy to access so
[00:46:16.900 --> 00:46:21.620]   that you could just, I know that I'm not going to be using my personal assistant for
[00:46:21.620 --> 00:46:23.980]   the next four hours, so I'm going to mute it.
[00:46:23.980 --> 00:46:26.340]   And then you can mute and unmute it as you see fit.
[00:46:26.340 --> 00:46:29.300]   I think that would be like a huge relief.
[00:46:29.300 --> 00:46:35.540]   It would make a lot of people feel better knowing that they have more control over when
[00:46:35.540 --> 00:46:38.100]   that digital assistant is listening in.
[00:46:38.100 --> 00:46:45.460]   I have two home pods in my living room that I constantly, accidentally trigger.
[00:46:45.460 --> 00:46:49.700]   And I watched enough horror movies that when I was reading this, I thought, probably thinks
[00:46:49.700 --> 00:46:53.780]   that I'm a murderer because they probably hear a lot of screaming in my house all the
[00:46:53.780 --> 00:46:54.780]   time.
[00:46:54.780 --> 00:46:55.780]   Yeah.
[00:46:55.780 --> 00:46:56.780]   Yeah.
[00:46:56.780 --> 00:47:03.460]   I'm not bothered by the fact that the AI has to be backed up by human ears.
[00:47:03.460 --> 00:47:08.060]   The only time this becomes a really big concern is when you have stories come up.
[00:47:08.060 --> 00:47:12.460]   And I'm coming out that the contractors that are being outside contractors being used for
[00:47:12.460 --> 00:47:16.740]   this are abusing access to these recordings, like they have the ability to carry some of
[00:47:16.740 --> 00:47:20.700]   these recordings away or they have the ability to do a little bit of freelance work and
[00:47:20.700 --> 00:47:22.780]   find out who is listening to this sort of stuff.
[00:47:22.780 --> 00:47:23.780]   And I do that.
[00:47:23.780 --> 00:47:24.780]   It's media organizations.
[00:47:24.780 --> 00:47:25.780]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:47:25.780 --> 00:47:31.980]   And I don't, and the only other problem is that once law enforcement finds out that
[00:47:31.980 --> 00:47:36.740]   it's possible that maybe there was an open mic in this person's house for any length
[00:47:36.740 --> 00:47:42.860]   of time that they might be able to subpoena a company saying that we want any voice recordings
[00:47:42.860 --> 00:47:47.820]   you might have from any active assistant device that might be owned in any of the following
[00:47:47.820 --> 00:47:53.740]   five homes that are associated with our suspect or this person of interest.
[00:47:53.740 --> 00:47:57.620]   And that's why a company like Apple needs being positioned to say we don't have that
[00:47:57.620 --> 00:48:03.620]   information because we either destroy 99% of all the recordings we make and the ones that
[00:48:03.620 --> 00:48:08.300]   we do that we actually keep, we destroy all the identifiable information.
[00:48:08.300 --> 00:48:13.620]   So sorry, we will give you all the recordings we have.
[00:48:13.620 --> 00:48:14.620]   Here they are.
[00:48:14.620 --> 00:48:20.900]   Just wave your fingers saying, yep, there you go.
[00:48:20.900 --> 00:48:22.540]   Let's see.
[00:48:22.540 --> 00:48:25.260]   Let's, yeah, okay.
[00:48:25.260 --> 00:48:26.620]   Let's do one more and then we'll take a break.
[00:48:26.620 --> 00:48:33.540]   I want to talk about the 16 inch MacBook Pro and if I should wait, Renee Richie.
[00:48:33.540 --> 00:48:36.780]   I mean, were you planning on buying a 15 inch MacBook Pro today, Leo?
[00:48:36.780 --> 00:48:39.340]   No, no, that's a good point.
[00:48:39.340 --> 00:48:40.860]   Because you should definitely wait.
[00:48:40.860 --> 00:48:45.380]   I should always, I always should hover my finger over the button.
[00:48:45.380 --> 00:48:47.180]   The rumors are getting stronger and stronger.
[00:48:47.180 --> 00:48:52.540]   We'd heard first from Ming Chi Quo who said that Apple was buying these panels, 3072
[00:48:52.540 --> 00:48:54.380]   by 1920.
[00:48:54.380 --> 00:48:59.340]   These would be essentially 16 inch displays running in the 50 equivalent of a 15 inch
[00:48:59.340 --> 00:49:02.340]   MacBook Pro bezel with the smaller bezels.
[00:49:02.340 --> 00:49:03.340]   Okay, for 3K.
[00:49:03.340 --> 00:49:04.340]   Yeah.
[00:49:04.340 --> 00:49:08.140]   We're now also hearing rumors that there will be a new keyboard.
[00:49:08.140 --> 00:49:09.220]   No more butterfly key.
[00:49:09.220 --> 00:49:10.220]   Is that credible?
[00:49:10.220 --> 00:49:14.660]   Yeah, I mean, I think we talked, I think we talked about it a while ago.
[00:49:14.660 --> 00:49:19.980]   That was the general rumor and several outlets, I think, have mentioned it or several people.
[00:49:19.980 --> 00:49:22.460]   Have mentioned it was that Apple was working on a new keyboard.
[00:49:22.460 --> 00:49:26.060]   They've been working on it since a little time after they realized the other keyboard
[00:49:26.060 --> 00:49:27.060]   was non feasible.
[00:49:27.060 --> 00:49:30.220]   It's been a couple of years because as you can't just turn those things around.
[00:49:30.220 --> 00:49:33.780]   There's a lot of work that's involved in deploying a whole new keyboard and that it
[00:49:33.780 --> 00:49:35.980]   was going to debut in the 16 inch MacBook.
[00:49:35.980 --> 00:49:38.500]   And then Ming Chi Quo kind of muddied the waters because he said, no, it's going to
[00:49:38.500 --> 00:49:41.060]   appear in a new MacBook Air.
[00:49:41.060 --> 00:49:44.140]   And everyone's like, but there's the MacBook Air this year is just a spec bump.
[00:49:44.140 --> 00:49:46.180]   And then it turned out, yeah, it's just a spec bump.
[00:49:46.180 --> 00:49:47.540]   So it was like super confusing.
[00:49:47.540 --> 00:49:50.860]   And he said it was going to come into a spec bump MacBook next year, which sounded like
[00:49:50.860 --> 00:49:51.860]   the current MacBook.
[00:49:51.860 --> 00:49:55.580]   When everyone was hearing there was a 16 inch and now he's come back this week and said,
[00:49:55.580 --> 00:49:57.780]   oh, no, no, ignore that last report.
[00:49:57.780 --> 00:50:01.700]   I don't know what I was, I don't know what I was imbibing, but it is going to be in the
[00:50:01.700 --> 00:50:02.860]   16 inch MacBook Pro.
[00:50:02.860 --> 00:50:07.540]   And we've seen digit times and China economic daily, all with similar supply chain sourced
[00:50:07.540 --> 00:50:12.980]   rumors now that is coming this fall, which is typically for Apple, the October timeframe
[00:50:12.980 --> 00:50:13.980]   for MacBook Pros.
[00:50:13.980 --> 00:50:17.420]   And also that there might be two new iPads at that time.
[00:50:17.420 --> 00:50:22.020]   Several, which is confounding because Apple is, you know, they put up the new iPad Pros
[00:50:22.020 --> 00:50:26.340]   last October, have put up the new iPad mini and the new iPad Air.
[00:50:26.340 --> 00:50:33.060]   And this sounds like a 10 point two inch budget iPad update, which they updated not last year,
[00:50:33.060 --> 00:50:35.580]   not this year of March, but last year March.
[00:50:35.580 --> 00:50:39.540]   So they're, they are really up in the, up in the ante on their iPad updates.
[00:50:39.540 --> 00:50:40.540]   Yeah.
[00:50:40.540 --> 00:50:46.620]   And June filing with the Eurasian Economic Commission, basically kind of like an FCC filing listed
[00:50:46.620 --> 00:50:51.860]   seven models of those, the MacBook Air, MacBook Pro.
[00:50:51.860 --> 00:50:56.260]   And the Air should have the new keyboard too when they do the next update.
[00:50:56.260 --> 00:51:00.420]   Numbers took up four of them, but there are three model numbers that were not taken yet
[00:51:00.420 --> 00:51:01.700]   by the July releases.
[00:51:01.700 --> 00:51:06.620]   So that's another, I guess another piece of evidence, maybe even that it might be sooner
[00:51:06.620 --> 00:51:10.580]   if they submitted it at the same time as they did the new MacBook Air and the new MacBook
[00:51:10.580 --> 00:51:12.380]   Escape.
[00:51:12.380 --> 00:51:18.820]   It's just, it's a weird schedule because the previous budget iPads were, they were early
[00:51:18.820 --> 00:51:21.940]   releases in the year people bought them for back to school.
[00:51:21.940 --> 00:51:23.340]   And this is much later in the year.
[00:51:23.340 --> 00:51:24.340]   Yeah.
[00:51:24.340 --> 00:51:26.700]   So it's different again, but they just released the new air.
[00:51:26.700 --> 00:51:28.740]   So it's going to differentiate that from the air.
[00:51:28.740 --> 00:51:34.180]   It's 10.2 is it the sizes of life iPads that are extant in our galaxy right now is amazing
[00:51:34.180 --> 00:51:38.060]   compared like they were all 9.7 and then 7.9 and 9.7.
[00:51:38.060 --> 00:51:39.220]   Now we'll have 12.9.
[00:51:39.220 --> 00:51:40.220]   We'll have 11.
[00:51:40.220 --> 00:51:45.660]   We'll have 10.5, 10.2, 9.7, 7.9.
[00:51:45.660 --> 00:51:47.220]   It's starting to feel like a Samsung tweet.
[00:51:47.220 --> 00:51:48.900]   I don't know how to feel about that.
[00:51:48.900 --> 00:51:50.540]   It's starting to feel like a shoe size.
[00:51:50.540 --> 00:51:51.540]   It's like a 9.5.
[00:51:51.540 --> 00:51:55.100]   I need the white one.
[00:51:55.100 --> 00:51:56.420]   Well I think more is always good.
[00:51:56.420 --> 00:52:00.940]   I'm excited and I'm really interested in that 16-inch shirt, but it'll be the fall.
[00:52:00.940 --> 00:52:02.780]   It won't be any sooner than that I guess.
[00:52:02.780 --> 00:52:06.700]   Yeah, and I'm super curious because the rumor price tag was around $3,000 which upset a
[00:52:06.700 --> 00:52:10.020]   lot of people because that's 600 more than the 15-inch.
[00:52:10.020 --> 00:52:14.180]   And you just have to remember the 17-inch was more than the 15-inch because we do almost
[00:52:14.180 --> 00:52:16.820]   every vendor basis pricing on size.
[00:52:16.820 --> 00:52:19.220]   And we also have no idea what the specs will be on it.
[00:52:19.220 --> 00:52:24.540]   An Intel has some real expensive processors now that could radically change the price
[00:52:24.540 --> 00:52:29.820]   of the unit depending on which one they put in, but also if there's Face ID and it offers
[00:52:29.820 --> 00:52:31.460]   other technologies in it.
[00:52:31.460 --> 00:52:36.620]   That was the other rumors that they put Face ID in, but if you have small bezels, it's
[00:52:36.620 --> 00:52:38.820]   going to be hard to put in all those experts.
[00:52:38.820 --> 00:52:43.100]   Google has shown you can put it Face ID and add a radar into tiny bezels.
[00:52:43.100 --> 00:52:46.500]   That's not an interesting one.
[00:52:46.500 --> 00:52:53.620]   Well, it's also interesting if it really is a MacBook Pro Pro, a MacBook Pro squared, and
[00:52:53.620 --> 00:52:56.460]   they're really putting hotter CPUs in there.
[00:52:56.460 --> 00:52:58.260]   That's not a problem.
[00:52:58.260 --> 00:53:06.100]   They're gaming CPUs that are the size of lunch trays that have actually huge active fans.
[00:53:06.100 --> 00:53:10.260]   But if they have to make it just a little bit thicker to accommodate the cooling necessary
[00:53:10.260 --> 00:53:11.500]   for this kind of a fan.
[00:53:11.500 --> 00:53:14.780]   And the bigger battery I would be happy.
[00:53:14.780 --> 00:53:16.580]   Yeah, it ups a whole bunch of things.
[00:53:16.580 --> 00:53:22.020]   It also would fall in line with them thinking that, well, we are absolutely not starved
[00:53:22.020 --> 00:53:23.020]   for space here.
[00:53:23.020 --> 00:53:26.740]   So let's put in that thicker keyboard into this model.
[00:53:26.740 --> 00:53:31.900]   And at least that way they'll have, they will not have had to make any space sacrifices
[00:53:31.900 --> 00:53:34.580]   for the rest of the MacBook line.
[00:53:34.580 --> 00:53:40.620]   And also, when inevitably, whenever you have a brand new key switch technology or any brand
[00:53:40.620 --> 00:53:44.740]   new thing that's in any brand new laptop, you're going to have a whole bunch of return
[00:53:44.740 --> 00:53:49.140]   turns in the first month and a half as you find out exactly how users can make these
[00:53:49.140 --> 00:53:50.140]   things fail.
[00:53:50.140 --> 00:53:56.580]   And when they get to the Rev B of this keyboard design, they're able to put all these new
[00:53:56.580 --> 00:54:03.060]   findings into the MacBook Air version of it and the MacBook Pro version of it.
[00:54:03.060 --> 00:54:06.060]   I would love to see kind of a MacBook Pro Pro.
[00:54:06.060 --> 00:54:07.060]   I like that notion.
[00:54:07.060 --> 00:54:10.020]   Like the Pro Workflow team's version of a MacBook Pro.
[00:54:10.020 --> 00:54:11.020]   Yeah.
[00:54:11.020 --> 00:54:15.620]   We all, many of us miss the 17 inch MacBook, but don't miss the size.
[00:54:15.620 --> 00:54:16.620]   Yeah.
[00:54:16.620 --> 00:54:21.580]   So I love the idea of fitting a 16 inch screen into roughly the same size as a 15 inch.
[00:54:21.580 --> 00:54:24.540]   I think all of that sounds, sounds exciting.
[00:54:24.540 --> 00:54:29.060]   I have it when it, when the Apple came up with the with the MacBook nothing.
[00:54:29.060 --> 00:54:33.540]   I have a friend who at the time, his daily driver was a 17 inch MacBook Pro.
[00:54:33.540 --> 00:54:37.220]   When I was, as it happened, I had my, my loaner unit with me.
[00:54:37.220 --> 00:54:38.860]   He had his 17 inch.
[00:54:38.860 --> 00:54:44.060]   And I had to take a picture of this book on top of the 70s, the 90 MacBook.
[00:54:44.060 --> 00:54:47.700]   And it really looked like one of those like novelty cosmetic cosmetic mirrors that shaped
[00:54:47.700 --> 00:54:48.700]   like a MacBook.
[00:54:48.700 --> 00:54:49.700]   Yeah.
[00:54:49.700 --> 00:54:50.700]   It was like for years.
[00:54:50.700 --> 00:54:51.700]   I used the 17 inch for years.
[00:54:51.700 --> 00:54:52.700]   Oh, yeah.
[00:54:52.700 --> 00:54:53.700]   I loved it.
[00:54:53.700 --> 00:54:54.700]   Me too.
[00:54:54.700 --> 00:54:55.700]   Me too.
[00:54:55.700 --> 00:54:58.940]   I still have a 17 inch Linux machine on my, at my breakfast table.
[00:54:58.940 --> 00:55:00.620]   That's my, that's my morning machine.
[00:55:00.620 --> 00:55:02.180]   And I really like the size.
[00:55:02.180 --> 00:55:04.540]   It's nice to have that size.
[00:55:04.540 --> 00:55:10.980]   So I also would, I would also think that it's not completely logical to say to people, if
[00:55:10.980 --> 00:55:15.980]   you want thin and light and you're, you know, we've got the MacBook Air, you're going to
[00:55:15.980 --> 00:55:17.780]   have a slightly less processor.
[00:55:17.780 --> 00:55:19.740]   You're going to have a butterfly keyboard.
[00:55:19.740 --> 00:55:20.740]   We have that.
[00:55:20.740 --> 00:55:22.020]   And I think that that's a great thing to offer.
[00:55:22.020 --> 00:55:24.500]   I like my MacBook Air a lot.
[00:55:24.500 --> 00:55:29.900]   And then if you want a more powerful machine, a pro pro machine, pro squared machine, then
[00:55:29.900 --> 00:55:31.100]   that's, that's the other option.
[00:55:31.100 --> 00:55:33.100]   I think it's very bad thing to offer both.
[00:55:33.100 --> 00:55:34.100]   I don't think that's a problem.
[00:55:34.100 --> 00:55:35.780]   They're issuing the plus humor.
[00:55:35.780 --> 00:55:40.700]   Like they had a group of people who they knew like there's this whole, in the old days,
[00:55:40.700 --> 00:55:45.540]   it was all these graphic intensive pro, like those were the hardcore pros, but then a
[00:55:45.540 --> 00:55:49.860]   bunch of new people, including, you know, founders decided to self identify as pros.
[00:55:49.860 --> 00:55:50.860]   That's right.
[00:55:50.860 --> 00:55:54.180]   And I figured out they could shift them off the MacBook Pros that were just a little thinner
[00:55:54.180 --> 00:55:55.180]   and lighter.
[00:55:55.180 --> 00:55:56.180]   And boy, did they?
[00:55:56.180 --> 00:55:59.940]   I mean, if you look at the results for MacBook Pros, they were stellar, but they did it at
[00:55:59.940 --> 00:56:05.300]   the extent of adding those to the lineup or making a more powerful one on the top end,
[00:56:05.300 --> 00:56:08.420]   the way they made a stripped down one on the bottom end, they just alienated all those
[00:56:08.420 --> 00:56:09.700]   pros for a bunch of years.
[00:56:09.700 --> 00:56:12.660]   And it feels like this last year has been them making it up.
[00:56:12.660 --> 00:56:14.340]   PC makers have been doing that for a year.
[00:56:14.340 --> 00:56:19.420]   They've had the executive model, you know, for the, for the sea level executives, just
[00:56:19.420 --> 00:56:21.220]   thin and light and beautiful.
[00:56:21.220 --> 00:56:25.820]   And they've had the power model for the, for the guys who actually do work.
[00:56:25.820 --> 00:56:26.820]   And that's fine.
[00:56:26.820 --> 00:56:27.820]   I don't think it's a bad thing.
[00:56:27.820 --> 00:56:28.820]   I know.
[00:56:28.820 --> 00:56:31.900]   I mean, the in between Leo, you need the, the, for the CEO who thinks he does work because
[00:56:31.900 --> 00:56:33.740]   he does the color to do work on the websites.
[00:56:33.740 --> 00:56:37.180]   And he wants the word pro, but he doesn't want the way to leave.
[00:56:37.180 --> 00:56:38.180]   Or she doesn't want the way.
[00:56:38.180 --> 00:56:43.260]   At least it's funny who's our CEO and happens to be my wife, uh, will always says, I want
[00:56:43.260 --> 00:56:44.740]   the fastest one of it.
[00:56:44.740 --> 00:56:45.740]   Whatever it is.
[00:56:45.740 --> 00:56:46.980]   I want the fastest one of it.
[00:56:46.980 --> 00:56:51.860]   And I hate to burst her bubble, but she doesn't really need the fastest one of anything.
[00:56:51.860 --> 00:56:54.740]   Uh, no, no, no, see, you're misinterpreting this.
[00:56:54.740 --> 00:56:58.500]   It's like, it's, she's, she's taking, she's taking one for the team by saying this is
[00:56:58.500 --> 00:57:02.220]   a brand new brand new model has never been tested.
[00:57:02.220 --> 00:57:05.460]   It's probably going to be filled with hardware bugs and software and capabilities.
[00:57:05.460 --> 00:57:09.380]   I would never inflict that upon the people working for me.
[00:57:09.380 --> 00:57:13.860]   Let me have all the, all the restarts on the battery problems and all the keyboard issues.
[00:57:13.860 --> 00:57:14.860]   Yeah.
[00:57:14.860 --> 00:57:20.780]   And, and, and the like, and then the Kryptonian AI based powered CPU.
[00:57:20.780 --> 00:57:21.780]   Okay.
[00:57:21.780 --> 00:57:22.780]   That's two.
[00:57:22.780 --> 00:57:26.180]   And because she's a CEO and she's my wife and I love her and we wouldn't be anywhere, uh,
[00:57:26.180 --> 00:57:30.660]   successful as we are without her, she gets the fastest one, whatever it is.
[00:57:30.660 --> 00:57:32.340]   She's probably going to get a Mac pro.
[00:57:32.340 --> 00:57:33.540]   I wouldn't be surprised.
[00:57:33.540 --> 00:57:35.260]   Cause she already ordered it.
[00:57:35.260 --> 00:57:36.260]   Yeah.
[00:57:36.260 --> 00:57:39.740]   She just got the widest screen I've ever seen in my life.
[00:57:39.740 --> 00:57:40.820]   I don't know.
[00:57:40.820 --> 00:57:45.500]   It's so wide that, uh, her, her Mac, in fact, I'm going to have to give her the iMac pro
[00:57:45.500 --> 00:57:47.300]   will actually think since two screens.
[00:57:47.300 --> 00:57:48.300]   It doesn't understand.
[00:57:48.300 --> 00:57:49.300]   This is one.
[00:57:49.300 --> 00:57:54.180]   She has one every quit show at once Leo is a, it's, well, actually that's kind of what
[00:57:54.180 --> 00:57:55.180]   she's doing.
[00:57:55.180 --> 00:57:56.620]   She's got all sorts of stuff going.
[00:57:56.620 --> 00:57:58.100]   It's a very elaborate screen.
[00:57:58.100 --> 00:58:01.860]   Maybe she does need the fastest one plus Pokemon and Harry Potter at the same time.
[00:58:01.860 --> 00:58:02.860]   This is amazing.
[00:58:02.860 --> 00:58:03.860]   Yes.
[00:58:03.860 --> 00:58:04.860]   She plays.
[00:58:04.860 --> 00:58:05.860]   That's another thing.
[00:58:05.860 --> 00:58:08.820]   I look at her with wonder and awe because I can, I can only play one game at a time.
[00:58:08.820 --> 00:58:12.660]   She plays both Pokemon and Harry Potter at the same time.
[00:58:12.660 --> 00:58:14.740]   Part of it though, she has that Pokeball, right?
[00:58:14.740 --> 00:58:15.740]   Yeah.
[00:58:15.740 --> 00:58:17.860]   So she can get the Pokeball run and spin in the stops.
[00:58:17.860 --> 00:58:18.860]   You need a wand.
[00:58:18.860 --> 00:58:19.860]   You need a wand in the eye.
[00:58:19.860 --> 00:58:20.860]   I'm waiting for the wand.
[00:58:20.860 --> 00:58:23.260]   You know, Niantic's going to do a wand.
[00:58:23.260 --> 00:58:24.260]   So good.
[00:58:24.260 --> 00:58:28.700]   Then there are third party manufacturers are making special styluses.
[00:58:28.700 --> 00:58:29.700]   Yeah.
[00:58:29.700 --> 00:58:30.700]   Wand shape styluses.
[00:58:30.700 --> 00:58:34.980]   They look kind of kind of a, I would have wanted if they had one there, but they just
[00:58:34.980 --> 00:58:36.300]   had Scorpius as one.
[00:58:36.300 --> 00:58:37.300]   That's silly.
[00:58:37.300 --> 00:58:38.860]   That's silly, silly, silly.
[00:58:38.860 --> 00:58:42.380]   I showed today brought to you by Hover speaking of buying things.
[00:58:42.380 --> 00:58:44.460]   Somebody told me there's a dot media domain.
[00:58:44.460 --> 00:58:47.740]   So the first thing I did is I went over to Hover.
[00:58:47.740 --> 00:58:52.740]   This is where I get all my domains and, and I bought a bunch of dot media domains.
[00:58:52.740 --> 00:58:55.220]   Hover is awesome.
[00:58:55.220 --> 00:58:59.980]   Hover is the place to register the domains because there's, this is, these are all my domains.
[00:58:59.980 --> 00:59:04.660]   I have a few because there's so little folder all involved.
[00:59:04.660 --> 00:59:07.620]   I just bought a bunch of twit domains, twit media.
[00:59:07.620 --> 00:59:13.380]   Of course, I had to get twit media tech, I media twit dot app, twit.email, twit.network,
[00:59:13.380 --> 00:59:14.900]   twit.technology, twit.el.
[00:59:14.900 --> 00:59:18.340]   I'll see twit.studio twit.news twit.show.io fan.
[00:59:18.340 --> 00:59:23.260]   There are over 400 TLDs, top level domains.
[00:59:23.260 --> 00:59:29.580]   Hover has all the best TLDs to choose from when building your brand online.
[00:59:29.580 --> 00:59:32.340]   No matter what you want to build, there's a domain name waiting for it.
[00:59:32.340 --> 00:59:36.540]   I'm so glad we've gotten past the old dot com dot net metaphor.
[00:59:36.540 --> 00:59:39.980]   It's, you know, we've had twit.tv for a long time.
[00:59:39.980 --> 00:59:43.060]   And I think when we first got it, we had to explain it.
[00:59:43.060 --> 00:59:44.060]   Not anymore though.
[00:59:44.060 --> 00:59:45.620]   I'm really happy to say it's really great.
[00:59:45.620 --> 00:59:51.860]   We can, we can use these domains twit.ninja twit.pizza.
[00:59:51.860 --> 00:59:54.620]   Whatever your needs are, hover is the place.
[00:59:54.620 --> 00:59:57.540]   First of all, no upsell.
[00:59:57.540 --> 01:00:01.700]   It's not 18 pages of crap you don't want to buy before you get your domain.
[01:00:01.700 --> 01:00:03.620]   You can get it fast and easy.
[01:00:03.620 --> 01:00:05.740]   Who is privacy is automatic?
[01:00:05.740 --> 01:00:07.020]   They know you want that.
[01:00:07.020 --> 01:00:08.020]   So that's automatic.
[01:00:08.020 --> 01:00:09.460]   That's just built in.
[01:00:09.460 --> 01:00:14.460]   The best tech support anywhere, they're there to answer questions, not upsell you.
[01:00:14.460 --> 01:00:16.500]   I can't say that that's the case everywhere else.
[01:00:16.500 --> 01:00:18.180]   Oh yeah, Duck Global now.
[01:00:18.180 --> 01:00:19.180]   Duck Global.
[01:00:19.180 --> 01:00:21.060]   It's a big sale on Duck Global.
[01:00:21.060 --> 01:00:22.060]   74% off.
[01:00:22.060 --> 01:00:24.980]   I forgot to get twit.global.
[01:00:24.980 --> 01:00:25.980]   So many great dough.
[01:00:25.980 --> 01:00:29.340]   I visit all the time because I get ideas for new domain names.
[01:00:29.340 --> 01:00:31.700]   Very clean, easy to navigate UI.
[01:00:31.700 --> 01:00:34.540]   And I love this if you're watching the video.
[01:00:34.540 --> 01:00:37.540]   They have one kind of one button.
[01:00:37.540 --> 01:00:40.700]   Connect your name to all of the different things you use.
[01:00:40.700 --> 01:00:45.980]   Squarespace and WordPress and Twitter and GitHub and all of that stuff.
[01:00:45.980 --> 01:00:48.700]   So it makes it very easy for you to get a domain.
[01:00:48.700 --> 01:00:50.540]   And this is my recommendation.
[01:00:50.540 --> 01:00:54.180]   Get a domain name from an independent registrar that just does that.
[01:00:54.180 --> 01:00:56.020]   They don't do web hosting.
[01:00:56.020 --> 01:00:58.060]   They just do domain names.
[01:00:58.060 --> 01:01:00.220]   And then get your web hosting from another company.
[01:01:00.220 --> 01:01:03.060]   That way if you decide to move companies, you don't have to worry about it because the
[01:01:03.060 --> 01:01:06.060]   hover has a domain name and it keeps it safe for you.
[01:01:06.060 --> 01:01:09.060]   It's really important to keep you, I think, to keep your domain name separate from your
[01:01:09.060 --> 01:01:11.340]   hosting.
[01:01:11.340 --> 01:01:15.460]   And it's hard if you do it with the hosting to move it out of there.
[01:01:15.460 --> 01:01:23.540]   Hover is kind of as clean and easy and simple to use as, well, Apple, as anywhere that you,
[01:01:23.540 --> 01:01:24.820]   you know, it's just really great.
[01:01:24.820 --> 01:01:26.140]   I love it.
[01:01:26.140 --> 01:01:30.180]   And incidentally, domain name management, it couldn't be simpler because I am always
[01:01:30.180 --> 01:01:33.780]   going into my DNS settings and modifying them and changing them.
[01:01:33.780 --> 01:01:37.100]   And if that's something you do, you'll love the interface.
[01:01:37.100 --> 01:01:38.540]   Take a name for yourself with Hover.
[01:01:38.540 --> 01:01:40.980]   Go to hover.com/twit.
[01:01:40.980 --> 01:01:45.220]   Get your first 10% off your first purchase of any domain extension for the whole first
[01:01:45.220 --> 01:01:46.220]   year.
[01:01:46.220 --> 01:01:49.060]   Hey, Twit Network fans.
[01:01:49.060 --> 01:01:50.860]   That's hover.com/twit.
[01:01:50.860 --> 01:01:55.420]   10% off for a full year just as a way of saying thank you.
[01:01:55.420 --> 01:01:59.740]   And I thank you for using that special address because that way they know you saw it here.
[01:01:59.740 --> 01:02:00.740]   Hover.com/twit.
[01:02:00.740 --> 01:02:04.900]   Find a domain for your great ideas.
[01:02:04.900 --> 01:02:08.700]   Step and start in your new business, your new idea, your new website.
[01:02:08.700 --> 01:02:10.180]   And they've got all the extensions.
[01:02:10.180 --> 01:02:11.700]   Man, I should have gotten global.
[01:02:11.700 --> 01:02:14.620]   Let's see if I can get Leo.global.
[01:02:14.620 --> 01:02:17.060]   15 bucks.
[01:02:17.060 --> 01:02:19.420]   That's such a great deal.
[01:02:19.420 --> 01:02:22.580]   I'm going to bump on.
[01:02:22.580 --> 01:02:25.700]   We go with the show.
[01:02:25.700 --> 01:02:27.260]   Where's the credit card?
[01:02:27.260 --> 01:02:29.420]   I want my credit card.
[01:02:29.420 --> 01:02:30.420]   Where is it?
[01:02:30.420 --> 01:02:32.900]   Wasn't it supposed to come out with iOS 12.4?
[01:02:32.900 --> 01:02:33.900]   That's what we got.
[01:02:33.900 --> 01:02:37.020]   It's the software that you're waiting on the hardware.
[01:02:37.020 --> 01:02:38.020]   What's the hardware?
[01:02:38.020 --> 01:02:40.220]   It's a piece of titanium.
[01:02:40.220 --> 01:02:42.500]   I love the story.
[01:02:42.500 --> 01:02:48.980]   My guy Mark Herman Bloomberg, he says, "Apple took the design of the card and the design
[01:02:48.980 --> 01:02:53.060]   of the app and let Goldman do the rest."
[01:02:53.060 --> 01:02:55.900]   That's how it should be.
[01:02:55.900 --> 01:02:59.020]   I think I will get one as soon as I can.
[01:02:59.020 --> 01:03:00.620]   I know people have them.
[01:03:00.620 --> 01:03:02.220]   Apple employees have them and have been using them.
[01:03:02.220 --> 01:03:03.740]   I think they're getting very close.
[01:03:03.740 --> 01:03:06.740]   Goldman Sachs will, of course, be running the back end.
[01:03:06.740 --> 01:03:12.300]   This is the card that has 1% cash back for purchases with the credit card, 2% cash back
[01:03:12.300 --> 01:03:18.620]   for purchases with Apple Pay and 3% for purchases of Apple products or services.
[01:03:18.620 --> 01:03:23.420]   It is really, and Herman points this out, really intended to get you to use Apple Pay.
[01:03:23.420 --> 01:03:24.420]   Sure, there's a card.
[01:03:24.420 --> 01:03:26.100]   I think it's funny, back, Leo.
[01:03:26.100 --> 01:03:28.060]   You're going to get so much from you.
[01:03:28.060 --> 01:03:30.060]   You and Alex, what's not going to be?
[01:03:30.060 --> 01:03:31.300]   I love Apple Pay.
[01:03:31.300 --> 01:03:33.540]   I mean, others have pointed out, "Okay, sure."
[01:03:33.540 --> 01:03:36.580]   I think it was the target card has 4%.
[01:03:36.580 --> 01:03:41.380]   If you bought your MacBook at Target instead, you'd get more back than getting it from Apple.
[01:03:41.380 --> 01:03:42.380]   Okay, fine.
[01:03:42.380 --> 01:03:44.580]   It's not a titanium card.
[01:03:44.580 --> 01:03:47.980]   You're not going to press it for a state with your target card.
[01:03:47.980 --> 01:03:53.380]   The more importantly, the privacy aspects of this is the same privacy as Apple Pay, right?
[01:03:53.380 --> 01:03:54.980]   The behavioral stuff, like the...
[01:03:54.980 --> 01:03:57.420]   It's basically Apple Health for your financial...
[01:03:57.420 --> 01:04:00.220]   It's basically financial health built into the app.
[01:04:00.220 --> 01:04:01.220]   Pay down this debt.
[01:04:01.220 --> 01:04:02.220]   Do this.
[01:04:02.220 --> 01:04:03.220]   If you make these payments, keep this under this way.
[01:04:03.220 --> 01:04:04.700]   There's not much spending on this.
[01:04:04.700 --> 01:04:06.380]   Did you really need that third piece of lasagna?
[01:04:06.380 --> 01:04:08.020]   I mean, it's going to be great.
[01:04:08.020 --> 01:04:09.540]   I hope they don't do that.
[01:04:09.540 --> 01:04:14.740]   All Apple said is this summer, but everybody feels like the 12-point...
[01:04:14.740 --> 01:04:17.380]   Because 12.4 added the wallet capability.
[01:04:17.380 --> 01:04:21.060]   I think now, remember, we talked about 12.4 fixing those flaws.
[01:04:21.060 --> 01:04:25.860]   I think it may be that Apple wasn't planning on a recent 12.4 until the card was ready,
[01:04:25.860 --> 01:04:29.660]   but said, "Well, we got to get this out now because of those fixes."
[01:04:29.660 --> 01:04:31.020]   Is that credible?
[01:04:31.020 --> 01:04:32.020]   Could be.
[01:04:32.020 --> 01:04:33.020]   Could be.
[01:04:33.020 --> 01:04:34.020]   That makes sense.
[01:04:34.020 --> 01:04:35.220]   Predictions for the card, anybody?
[01:04:35.220 --> 01:04:38.300]   Laurie, when do you think it's going to be?
[01:04:38.300 --> 01:04:40.660]   I think it's going to be...
[01:04:40.660 --> 01:04:41.660]   Let me look at my calendar.
[01:04:41.660 --> 01:04:43.660]   It's going to be on a Thursday.
[01:04:43.660 --> 01:04:44.660]   It'll be...
[01:04:44.660 --> 01:04:45.660]   I love this.
[01:04:45.660 --> 01:04:48.140]   It'll be Thursday, August 8th.
[01:04:48.140 --> 01:04:50.020]   Thursday, August 8th.
[01:04:50.020 --> 01:04:51.500]   Can we start the pool now?
[01:04:51.500 --> 01:04:52.500]   All right, I...
[01:04:52.500 --> 01:04:53.500]   Just after the show.
[01:04:53.500 --> 01:04:55.460]   They'll just do it right after the show.
[01:04:55.460 --> 01:04:57.180]   Isn't that the usual mode of something like that?
[01:04:57.180 --> 01:04:58.180]   Yeah, that's right.
[01:04:58.180 --> 01:05:01.060]   Okay, the quarterly results today, they don't want to scoop that.
[01:05:01.060 --> 01:05:02.060]   Or maybe they do.
[01:05:02.060 --> 01:05:03.820]   I'm depending on what bed.
[01:05:03.820 --> 01:05:08.620]   Tim will just say an Apple card is available now, and then everybody will run the headline,
[01:05:08.620 --> 01:05:09.620]   right?
[01:05:09.620 --> 01:05:10.620]   The headline, right?
[01:05:10.620 --> 01:05:11.620]   The monster won't ask a question.
[01:05:11.620 --> 01:05:12.620]   Maybe that's it.
[01:05:12.620 --> 01:05:14.700]   What do you think Renee August 8th sounds pretty credible?
[01:05:14.700 --> 01:05:15.700]   I think...
[01:05:15.700 --> 01:05:20.020]   Yeah, or if Leo, if you were to play for any other card right now, the breath of a
[01:05:20.020 --> 01:05:22.500]   could get Apple paid so much faster.
[01:05:22.500 --> 01:05:23.500]   Apple card, I mean so much faster.
[01:05:23.500 --> 01:05:24.500]   Holding off.
[01:05:24.500 --> 01:05:27.780]   I want my Apple card.
[01:05:27.780 --> 01:05:28.940]   How about you, Andy?
[01:05:28.940 --> 01:05:29.940]   Any prediction?
[01:05:29.940 --> 01:05:31.940]   It's a silly thing.
[01:05:31.940 --> 01:05:38.740]   If this is the prices right, I'd have to bid August 9th because that way with $1 over.
[01:05:38.740 --> 01:05:47.860]   Yeah, unless you worry won the $500 bonus, which is a huge, huge time to pop up.
[01:05:47.860 --> 01:05:52.580]   It seems like I feel as though they definitely are going to want to have it in operation at
[01:05:52.580 --> 01:05:56.220]   least a month before their September announcements because they're going to want people to try
[01:05:56.220 --> 01:05:59.260]   out their new Apple cards on their new hardware.
[01:05:59.260 --> 01:06:03.140]   They're not going to want to have people put that on their Discover card or God forbid
[01:06:03.140 --> 01:06:04.140]   PayPal.
[01:06:04.140 --> 01:06:10.060]   Yeah, I think mid-August is definitely a good bet.
[01:06:10.060 --> 01:06:17.460]   The creator of the Xbox, Nat Brown has joined Apple.
[01:06:17.460 --> 01:06:19.900]   His resume is a lot more than just Xbox.
[01:06:19.900 --> 01:06:26.340]   He was at Valve and did VR for Valve.
[01:06:26.340 --> 01:06:30.580]   Is that the VIVE, the HTC VIVE that Valve is in partnership with?
[01:06:30.580 --> 01:06:32.100]   Valve worked, but now they have the...
[01:06:32.100 --> 01:06:33.100]   They have their own.
[01:06:33.100 --> 01:06:36.100]   They're really weirdly named like yeah.
[01:06:36.100 --> 01:06:39.140]   He says in a tweet...
[01:06:39.140 --> 01:06:40.140]   Index, right?
[01:06:40.140 --> 01:06:41.140]   The Valve Index?
[01:06:41.140 --> 01:06:42.140]   The Index, I say.
[01:06:42.140 --> 01:06:47.020]   He says in a tweet thread announcing his move to Apple, "I was always fascinated with how
[01:06:47.020 --> 01:06:53.100]   hard games push software and hardware platforms in the UI and UX in memory and storage and
[01:06:53.100 --> 01:06:58.580]   network requirements, real-time rendering, low latency, input, audio quality and multimedia.
[01:06:58.580 --> 01:06:59.580]   Generally...
[01:06:59.580 --> 01:07:05.580]   I don't know where the connective tissue is.
[01:07:05.580 --> 01:07:09.820]   Systems Engineering, where you tune and improve the hardware services software for developers.
[01:07:09.820 --> 01:07:14.460]   I love helping teams across disciplines understand complex end-to-end requirements through concrete
[01:07:14.460 --> 01:07:15.460]   examples.
[01:07:15.460 --> 01:07:21.020]   Basically, he says, "A major threat of my career is an obsession with platform ecosystems
[01:07:21.020 --> 01:07:23.580]   and systems engineering."
[01:07:23.580 --> 01:07:25.580]   So apparently he's going to...
[01:07:25.580 --> 01:07:31.860]   This is why last week when the guy who did the HoloLens left Apple and everyone said,
[01:07:31.860 --> 01:07:33.860]   "Oh, Apple's canceling all their plans!"
[01:07:33.860 --> 01:07:34.860]   No, they're not.
[01:07:34.860 --> 01:07:36.340]   And now they're ironed out.
[01:07:36.340 --> 01:07:40.020]   Seriously, you could have taken a deep breath back then, chuckles.
[01:07:40.020 --> 01:07:41.500]   Who knows though?
[01:07:41.500 --> 01:07:42.500]   You just don't know.
[01:07:42.500 --> 01:07:47.180]   I mean, this is clearly a guy with a lot of skills, a lot of interests.
[01:07:47.180 --> 01:07:52.700]   He could be working on VR or AR or he could be working on the iPhone for all we know.
[01:07:52.700 --> 01:07:53.700]   I mean...
[01:07:53.700 --> 01:07:56.940]   Or could be working on something wonderfully cross-disciplinary.
[01:07:56.940 --> 01:07:57.940]   Right.
[01:07:57.940 --> 01:07:59.260]   You know what?
[01:07:59.260 --> 01:08:08.460]   Apple hires smart people and then lets them do things that are interesting.
[01:08:08.460 --> 01:08:12.980]   Have you played with the new Beta 5 of iOS 13 Renee?
[01:08:12.980 --> 01:08:14.860]   Are you on the developer beta?
[01:08:14.860 --> 01:08:15.860]   Yes.
[01:08:15.860 --> 01:08:18.540]   Do you have anything to report?
[01:08:18.540 --> 01:08:23.620]   You can change the amount and size of the icons on your iPad screen, which is something
[01:08:23.620 --> 01:08:25.780]   I never knew and wanted to do until I did it.
[01:08:25.780 --> 01:08:26.780]   Wait a minute.
[01:08:26.780 --> 01:08:27.780]   What?
[01:08:27.780 --> 01:08:29.980]   Now, this goes along with...
[01:08:29.980 --> 01:08:30.980]   So this is iPadOS.
[01:08:30.980 --> 01:08:37.340]   This goes along with that new screen because it is true that because they're jamming more
[01:08:37.340 --> 01:08:40.580]   now on the home screen, the icons are smaller.
[01:08:40.580 --> 01:08:42.220]   So you can make them bigger?
[01:08:42.220 --> 01:08:43.220]   Yeah.
[01:08:43.220 --> 01:08:47.780]   You can go into settings and you can change the size of your grid.
[01:08:47.780 --> 01:08:48.780]   Oh.
[01:08:48.780 --> 01:08:49.780]   That's great.
[01:08:49.780 --> 01:08:52.340]   That's bigger or more smaller.
[01:08:52.340 --> 01:08:54.780]   So that's something I do regularly on Android.
[01:08:54.780 --> 01:08:57.860]   The Android launcher is not Google's, but the Android launcher is I use and I'm using
[01:08:57.860 --> 01:08:59.340]   Action Launcher right now.
[01:08:59.340 --> 01:09:01.860]   We'll let you say how big the icons are.
[01:09:01.860 --> 01:09:06.020]   We'll let you say the grid size, the width, the height.
[01:09:06.020 --> 01:09:07.020]   I actually...
[01:09:07.020 --> 01:09:09.860]   One of the things I love to do and I would love to see Apple do this, I take the text
[01:09:09.860 --> 01:09:14.780]   labels off because that takes up useless space.
[01:09:14.780 --> 01:09:18.540]   So I take the text labels off so I just have icons on my Android phone.
[01:09:18.540 --> 01:09:20.900]   That would be nice.
[01:09:20.900 --> 01:09:25.500]   This is all to make Springboard a little bit more customizable.
[01:09:25.500 --> 01:09:28.220]   I think they're also still experimenting with the stuff and they're using the beta
[01:09:28.220 --> 01:09:32.860]   period as a way to sort of roll out these features and test them with us and get our
[01:09:32.860 --> 01:09:33.860]   feedback.
[01:09:33.860 --> 01:09:34.860]   Yeah.
[01:09:34.860 --> 01:09:35.860]   Yeah.
[01:09:35.860 --> 01:09:36.860]   Okay.
[01:09:36.860 --> 01:09:43.660]   The problem with this, of course, is you can get unaesthetic results, but Apple looks like
[01:09:43.660 --> 01:09:45.860]   they're only really giving you an on or off switch.
[01:09:45.860 --> 01:09:46.860]   So it's not...
[01:09:46.860 --> 01:09:50.500]   You get two sizes, more or bigger.
[01:09:50.500 --> 01:09:51.500]   Yeah.
[01:09:51.500 --> 01:09:56.740]   It's funny because in some ways Google's lack of adhering to specific guidelines has
[01:09:56.740 --> 01:10:00.860]   forced developers and designers, especially to be like, you know, not so grant.
[01:10:00.860 --> 01:10:02.700]   Like, we don't have to be pixel perfect anymore.
[01:10:02.700 --> 01:10:05.260]   And that's something that iOS designers, I think, are still...
[01:10:05.260 --> 01:10:06.860]   What do you mean it's not going to be on the pixel grid?
[01:10:06.860 --> 01:10:09.380]   No, I crafted this as a 48 icon.
[01:10:09.380 --> 01:10:11.860]   If you showed it 46, I will come to your house and cut you.
[01:10:11.860 --> 01:10:14.620]   And you're slowly learning that they have to...
[01:10:14.620 --> 01:10:17.700]   As all the different screen sizes and implementations and now you have all these different window
[01:10:17.700 --> 01:10:22.220]   placements and options, I think we're slowly easing out of the pixels painfully out of
[01:10:22.220 --> 01:10:23.780]   the pixel perfect era.
[01:10:23.780 --> 01:10:27.220]   If you are interested in augmented reality, you can go to the Apple Store.
[01:10:27.220 --> 01:10:31.940]   There are three new today at Apple Sessions focused on AR.
[01:10:31.940 --> 01:10:34.940]   They call them ART.
[01:10:34.940 --> 01:10:35.940]   All right.
[01:10:35.940 --> 01:10:36.940]   Did you get it Leo?
[01:10:36.940 --> 01:10:37.940]   Art.
[01:10:37.940 --> 01:10:38.940]   Art.
[01:10:38.940 --> 01:10:39.940]   Art.
[01:10:39.940 --> 01:10:43.460]   So interactive...
[01:10:43.460 --> 01:10:47.380]   So women, they'll be available at Apple Store retail locations around the world include interactive
[01:10:47.380 --> 01:10:48.940]   walks.
[01:10:48.940 --> 01:10:51.460]   So it isn't for making AR, it's for playing with AR.
[01:10:51.460 --> 01:10:56.500]   In-store educational sessions using Swift Playgrounds, I guess that's for making AR.
[01:10:56.500 --> 01:11:00.580]   And an ART installation in every store.
[01:11:00.580 --> 01:11:05.820]   So get high-V to your Apple Store.
[01:11:05.820 --> 01:11:10.460]   To create sessions, Apple invited the new museum, a leading destination for temporary
[01:11:10.460 --> 01:11:12.900]   art in New York to select seven artists.
[01:11:12.900 --> 01:11:19.140]   Nick Cave, Natalie Jerberg, Hansberg, Ciaofei, Ciaofei, John Giorno and Carson Holler and
[01:11:19.140 --> 01:11:24.340]   Pippelotti Rist to participate in an experimental project that's free to the public.
[01:11:24.340 --> 01:11:27.300]   Oh, I'm going to have to go down to the Apple Store and look at that.
[01:11:27.300 --> 01:11:28.300]   And that's at every Apple Store.
[01:11:28.300 --> 01:11:29.300]   That's nice.
[01:11:29.300 --> 01:11:30.300]   This is going on.
[01:11:30.300 --> 01:11:35.020]   I mean, she quote on his rumors also said that Apple wants to get to 5G, can have much
[01:11:35.020 --> 01:11:42.220]   more ubiquitous low latency AR, augmented reality outside of the constraints of Wi-Fi.
[01:11:42.220 --> 01:11:44.740]   And it's almost like they're still working on AR projects.
[01:11:44.740 --> 01:11:47.100]   It's amazing.
[01:11:47.100 --> 01:11:49.860]   There will be the experimental walks will only be in some cities.
[01:11:49.860 --> 01:11:53.220]   San Francisco, New York, London, Paris, Hong Kong and Tokyo.
[01:11:53.220 --> 01:11:58.140]   You'll walk around in a group with an Apple genius who will say, "Oh, look over there
[01:11:58.140 --> 01:11:59.140]   at that building.
[01:11:59.140 --> 01:12:02.580]   There's a giant thing on it."
[01:12:02.580 --> 01:12:04.220]   Yikes.
[01:12:04.220 --> 01:12:07.300]   That's cool.
[01:12:07.300 --> 01:12:09.260]   Interesting, I guess.
[01:12:09.260 --> 01:12:12.620]   We all do this with Pokemon and Harry Potter, but the mainstream isn't.
[01:12:12.620 --> 01:12:17.340]   Especially the different facets of the mainstream weren't into VR or gaming.
[01:12:17.340 --> 01:12:21.540]   It aren't as familiar with it, but this will sort of ease the name to it because it's
[01:12:21.540 --> 01:12:22.540]   art.
[01:12:22.540 --> 01:12:26.940]   There's so much more to shooting up heroin than what you might have seen on TV shows.
[01:12:26.940 --> 01:12:31.580]   By getting the people on board with the onboard process for this new habit.
[01:12:31.580 --> 01:12:36.900]   Sorry, Andy, Andy, Andy, this will all come to your Apple Store August 10th.
[01:12:36.900 --> 01:12:39.060]   Two days after the Apple card comes out.
[01:12:39.060 --> 01:12:42.060]   No, no, I'm making that up.
[01:12:42.060 --> 01:12:45.500]   I have seen the best minds in my generation, correct your question.
[01:12:45.500 --> 01:12:49.580]   But it's an interesting question because let's say in a theoretical universe, 5 years from
[01:12:49.580 --> 01:12:50.660]   now, we're all walking around.
[01:12:50.660 --> 01:12:53.460]   Or even just 2 years from now, we have Apple glasses on our face.
[01:12:53.460 --> 01:12:55.940]   What's the compelling use case for that?
[01:12:55.940 --> 01:13:00.660]   We've seen some early prototypes that just show you messages or show you maps.
[01:13:00.660 --> 01:13:02.980]   But maps isn't really a killer feature.
[01:13:02.980 --> 01:13:07.620]   So we still have to figure out what is it that we need to be in our eyes all the time,
[01:13:07.620 --> 01:13:11.900]   what will make that worth while putting up with the short term pain and long term changes
[01:13:11.900 --> 01:13:14.180]   in society.
[01:13:14.180 --> 01:13:18.340]   Some of this stuff as silly as it sounds is just letting us experiment with all this
[01:13:18.340 --> 01:13:21.740]   AR stuff before we have any actual products for it.
[01:13:21.740 --> 01:13:24.140]   Yeah, that's why Google Glass.
[01:13:24.140 --> 01:13:28.580]   I was having a discussion with some friends on Twitter about it.
[01:13:28.580 --> 01:13:34.700]   And one of my really good friends thought that no, counter to my argument that the gold
[01:13:34.700 --> 01:13:38.860]   Apple watch was one of the dumbest things ever to be released as a tech product.
[01:13:38.860 --> 01:13:40.780]   He said, no, no, Google Glass was pointless.
[01:13:40.780 --> 01:13:41.780]   It was stupid.
[01:13:41.780 --> 01:13:43.900]   Oh, that's a list that goes on and on.
[01:13:43.900 --> 01:13:45.700]   There's a lot of competitors on that.
[01:13:45.700 --> 01:13:52.420]   But I would say, well, no, it was an experience because Google always marked it as it's an
[01:13:52.420 --> 01:13:53.420]   experiment.
[01:13:53.420 --> 01:13:58.700]   You can't just like order one and get it until like they gave up on it and had Xers left
[01:13:58.700 --> 01:13:59.700]   over.
[01:13:59.700 --> 01:14:02.660]   And it was like, we don't know what people are going to use this for until the sort of
[01:14:02.660 --> 01:14:06.780]   people who are so excited about this technology, they're willing to wait on a wait list and
[01:14:06.780 --> 01:14:10.100]   then spend $1,200 to $1,500 for it.
[01:14:10.100 --> 01:14:12.980]   You wear it and then tell us what the experience is like.
[01:14:12.980 --> 01:14:17.220]   And so yeah, I think we're still going to see another couple of waves of releases before
[01:14:17.220 --> 01:14:20.340]   we figure out exactly what people wanted for.
[01:14:20.340 --> 01:14:27.500]   And if really if Google ever actually gives us that anime Fox simply walks delicately on
[01:14:27.500 --> 01:14:33.860]   little little little black paws ahead of us turning left and right to show us exactly
[01:14:33.860 --> 01:14:38.860]   where we need to go in order to get to our destination, I will have considered this a
[01:14:38.860 --> 01:14:40.620]   life worth living.
[01:14:40.620 --> 01:14:45.900]   I will be very pleased to be well, the reps and there are pluses and minuses to being around
[01:14:45.900 --> 01:14:52.020]   in 2019, but that will definitely be one of the pluses.
[01:14:52.020 --> 01:14:59.300]   Apple's filed for a trademark oddly enough love from Johnny.
[01:14:59.300 --> 01:15:03.100]   Just as Johnny, I've leaves Apple, they're trademarking love.
[01:15:03.100 --> 01:15:05.820]   This is to me a very intriguing story.
[01:15:05.820 --> 01:15:07.700]   Like what are they thinking?
[01:15:07.700 --> 01:15:10.180]   Are they going to sell a product or I don't know.
[01:15:10.180 --> 01:15:11.180]   Are you sure Apple?
[01:15:11.180 --> 01:15:13.180]   Oh, maybe it wasn't Apple.
[01:15:13.180 --> 01:15:14.180]   Apple trademark.
[01:15:14.180 --> 01:15:15.180]   Oh, Johnny.
[01:15:15.180 --> 01:15:18.420]   And I filed for the trademark love from Johnny.
[01:15:18.420 --> 01:15:20.980]   Does this mean Marcus love from Mark?
[01:15:20.980 --> 01:15:23.500]   Like, are they going to have their own trademarks?
[01:15:23.500 --> 01:15:25.900]   Love from is the name of the new company.
[01:15:25.900 --> 01:15:26.900]   Yeah.
[01:15:26.900 --> 01:15:28.420]   So will they get their own sub brand?
[01:15:28.420 --> 01:15:29.420]   And trademark is love.
[01:15:29.420 --> 01:15:32.300]   Oh, I thought it was that by Miss Red.
[01:15:32.300 --> 01:15:36.940]   That would have been a real jerk move after all that.
[01:15:36.940 --> 01:15:38.340]   Oh, we're looking forward to work.
[01:15:38.340 --> 01:15:40.180]   Oh, by the way, we've just we're trademarked.
[01:15:40.180 --> 01:15:45.980]   Oh, yeah, no, love from is not really an Apple venture.
[01:15:45.980 --> 01:15:46.980]   Oh, sorry.
[01:15:46.980 --> 01:15:47.980]   We didn't.
[01:15:47.980 --> 01:15:51.700]   So love from is the company love from Johnny's the trademark.
[01:15:51.700 --> 01:15:52.700]   Forget Mark Newsom.
[01:15:52.700 --> 01:15:55.860]   I'm wondering, is there a love from Mark?
[01:15:55.860 --> 01:15:56.860]   Have we invested?
[01:15:56.860 --> 01:15:58.260]   Mark, Mark, we don't know.
[01:15:58.260 --> 01:16:00.060]   Get on that.
[01:16:00.060 --> 01:16:04.980]   And Huawei smartphone sales, you'd think they would have gone down after being banned
[01:16:04.980 --> 01:16:07.060]   from the United States.
[01:16:07.060 --> 01:16:14.460]   And to can allis, Huawei's Q2 smartphone sales rose 31% in China.
[01:16:14.460 --> 01:16:18.460]   And actually, we'd heard some stories that this was a kind of a patriotic move on the
[01:16:18.460 --> 01:16:20.340]   part of the Chinese buyer.
[01:16:20.340 --> 01:16:22.020]   Ever sell much in the US?
[01:16:22.020 --> 01:16:24.420]   I can't remember them ever selling that much.
[01:16:24.420 --> 01:16:26.660]   They rose 23% worldwide.
[01:16:26.660 --> 01:16:29.220]   OK, but 31% China.
[01:16:29.220 --> 01:16:33.100]   37.3 million units in the quarter.
[01:16:33.100 --> 01:16:37.860]   Now, I bet you Apple in this down quarter will have sold more iPhones than that, but I don't
[01:16:37.860 --> 01:16:38.860]   know.
[01:16:38.860 --> 01:16:39.860]   Maybe not.
[01:16:39.860 --> 01:16:42.260]   How many how many a quarter does Apple sell?
[01:16:42.260 --> 01:16:43.260]   20 million.
[01:16:43.260 --> 01:16:46.980]   But I don't know if they sell that many.
[01:16:46.980 --> 01:16:47.980]   30.
[01:16:47.980 --> 01:16:48.980]   That's good.
[01:16:48.980 --> 01:16:49.980]   31%.
[01:16:49.980 --> 01:16:53.740]   Anyway, there's a patriotic move of what to buy Chinese.
[01:16:53.740 --> 01:16:54.740]   Yeah.
[01:16:54.740 --> 01:16:58.940]   Remember in China, censorship is and censorship and lack of privacy is not a bug.
[01:16:58.940 --> 01:16:59.940]   It's a feature.
[01:16:59.940 --> 01:17:01.860]   It's a state required feature.
[01:17:01.860 --> 01:17:04.460]   We're about 15 minutes off from Apple's.
[01:17:04.460 --> 01:17:05.340]   Oh, no, half an hour.
[01:17:05.340 --> 01:17:06.340]   I didn't mind that.
[01:17:06.340 --> 01:17:07.340]   Scary.
[01:17:07.340 --> 01:17:08.340]   Sorry, Laurie.
[01:17:08.340 --> 01:17:09.340]   Half an hour.
[01:17:09.340 --> 01:17:10.340]   Well, people need to pee.
[01:17:10.340 --> 01:17:12.060]   Yeah, they got to get some lunch.
[01:17:12.060 --> 01:17:17.580]   Maybe, you know, fortify themselves with a quick shot of something before the Apple
[01:17:17.580 --> 01:17:18.580]   whiskey.
[01:17:18.580 --> 01:17:19.580]   Whiskey.
[01:17:19.580 --> 01:17:20.580]   Whisky.
[01:17:20.580 --> 01:17:21.580]   Whatever helps you type faster.
[01:17:21.580 --> 01:17:23.940]   So we'll get let's take a break and go to our.
[01:17:23.940 --> 01:17:28.180]   Well, Apple sold 41 million iPhones in this quarter in 2017.
[01:17:28.180 --> 01:17:29.780]   There you go.
[01:17:29.780 --> 01:17:31.580]   So it sounds like a lot to you.
[01:17:31.580 --> 01:17:32.660]   Look at Apple.
[01:17:32.660 --> 01:17:34.020]   That's amazing what Apple sells.
[01:17:34.020 --> 01:17:35.020]   It's incredible.
[01:17:35.020 --> 01:17:37.900]   But also, but the good thing we never know is what margins the other companies are making
[01:17:37.900 --> 01:17:43.140]   because in a lot of areas of consumer electronics, companies have seized massive amounts of market
[01:17:43.140 --> 01:17:49.420]   share by selling it like 1% or at zero or minus 1% and Apple's doing it at like 35%.
[01:17:49.420 --> 01:17:51.500]   Apple's making enough money.
[01:17:51.500 --> 01:17:52.500]   Well, just it.
[01:17:52.500 --> 01:17:56.060]   But again, playing devil's advocate, you don't.
[01:17:56.060 --> 01:18:00.380]   Other phone makers have to actually compete with other phone makers, whereas Apple always
[01:18:00.380 --> 01:18:04.820]   has the power to say, Oh, you'd think that's too much to spend or we're not making a phone
[01:18:04.820 --> 01:18:05.820]   that you want.
[01:18:05.820 --> 01:18:08.580]   Okay, let's find switch to Android switch to Windows.
[01:18:08.580 --> 01:18:13.540]   True, except for Palm famously sold central below cost to make up and make it up one volume
[01:18:13.540 --> 01:18:15.500]   in that almost destroyed them.
[01:18:15.500 --> 01:18:16.500]   Oh, yeah.
[01:18:16.500 --> 01:18:17.500]   Go ahead.
[01:18:17.500 --> 01:18:24.260]   I'm just saying that sometimes the smaller margins of the competitors isn't like we're
[01:18:24.260 --> 01:18:25.420]   trying to make it up for volume.
[01:18:25.420 --> 01:18:26.420]   It's like, no, we have to.
[01:18:26.420 --> 01:18:27.420]   It's what we're there.
[01:18:27.420 --> 01:18:28.420]   We have to charge.
[01:18:28.420 --> 01:18:30.820]   We have to do because they're there.
[01:18:30.820 --> 01:18:36.180]   Yeah, because like what look at the one plus, which is just totally like, Oh, wow, that's
[01:18:36.180 --> 01:18:40.060]   an actually a superb phone that's almost as pretty much as good as any other phone on
[01:18:40.060 --> 01:18:41.060]   the market.
[01:18:41.060 --> 01:18:45.220]   The cost 900 to $1,000 only doesn't cost 900 to $1,000 doesn't.
[01:18:45.220 --> 01:18:49.060]   And it really drives Google to say, tell you what, you know that Google that you know
[01:18:49.060 --> 01:18:54.500]   that pixel three phone we had, we can probably find a way to manufacture it for less money
[01:18:54.500 --> 01:18:59.460]   and actually start getting people to buy it for 500 instead of 900 dollars.
[01:18:59.460 --> 01:19:01.460]   Oh, I'm sorry.
[01:19:01.460 --> 01:19:02.460]   You caught me.
[01:19:02.460 --> 01:19:06.940]   I was ordering lunch.
[01:19:06.940 --> 01:19:08.620]   It's time for lunch.
[01:19:08.620 --> 01:19:12.060]   It's time for door dash.
[01:19:12.060 --> 01:19:13.460]   Let me see here.
[01:19:13.460 --> 01:19:19.340]   Maybe a burrito bowl from Chipotle, a delicious Wendy's burger.
[01:19:19.340 --> 01:19:25.260]   We got the habit burger down the street or I could just do it and have ice cream.
[01:19:25.260 --> 01:19:28.140]   Baskin and Robbins will be here in 28 minutes.
[01:19:28.140 --> 01:19:29.620]   Door dash is awesome.
[01:19:29.620 --> 01:19:34.300]   It brings the best restaurants in your city to your door.
[01:19:34.300 --> 01:19:37.260]   You love to cook, but you're not in the mood to do the dishes tonight.
[01:19:37.260 --> 01:19:42.700]   You're stuck at work and you just have to have something special.
[01:19:42.700 --> 01:19:46.660]   Well, get it delivered with door dash.
[01:19:46.660 --> 01:19:48.140]   Door dash makes ordering easy.

[01:19:49.140 --> 01:19:50.140]   I'm on it right here.
[01:19:50.140 --> 01:19:53.980]   And by the way, not only does it include your national change, your favorites like Subway

[01:20:05.260 --> 01:20:06.260]   Delicatessen.
[01:20:06.260 --> 01:20:08.180]   Oh, some good pizza here.
[01:20:08.180 --> 01:20:09.180]   Alfredo's best.
[01:20:09.180 --> 01:20:10.180]   Oh, me Puebla.

[01:20:12.660 --> 01:20:13.660]   New Yorker.

[01:21:13.100 --> 01:21:14.100]   How about a big Mac?
[01:21:14.100 --> 01:21:17.260]   I can have it here in half an hour.

[01:21:33.820 --> 01:21:34.820]   Door dash.

[01:21:42.300 --> 01:21:43.500]   in your community.
[01:21:43.500 --> 01:21:48.660]   I got this from my mom because she was complaining she had the some other app.
[01:21:48.660 --> 01:21:50.340]   I think they went that app went out of business.
[01:21:50.340 --> 01:21:53.340]   Then when I got another app, she said they don't have my favorite restaurants.
[01:21:53.340 --> 01:21:54.580]   Door dash did.
[01:21:54.580 --> 01:21:57.700]   And what I did and I think this is a great thing to do for if you have older parents,
[01:21:57.700 --> 01:21:58.940]   mom doesn't cook anymore.
[01:21:58.940 --> 01:21:59.940]   She's 86.
[01:21:59.940 --> 01:22:02.980]   She's kind of, you know, it's hard for her to cook, but I want to make sure that she's
[01:22:02.980 --> 01:22:05.980]   eating right and eating whenever she wants.
[01:22:05.980 --> 01:22:07.940]   So I set up door dash on her phone.
[01:22:07.940 --> 01:22:09.140]   I put my credit card in there.
[01:22:09.140 --> 01:22:13.380]   I said, mom, anytime, let me buy you dinner and just go to door dash and order the dinner.
[01:22:13.380 --> 01:22:14.820]   She does it at least a couple of times a week.
[01:22:14.820 --> 01:22:16.180]   And I just think that's the greatest thing.
[01:22:16.180 --> 01:22:18.180]   I thank you door dash for letting me do that.
[01:22:18.180 --> 01:22:19.580]   That worked so well for my mom.
[01:22:19.580 --> 01:22:25.060]   Lisa set that up for her parents to our in-laws because their favorite Alfredo's is on it.
[01:22:25.060 --> 01:22:29.540]   Delicious delivered door dash.
[01:22:29.540 --> 01:22:34.460]   Andy and I call I'd like a pick of the week from you, my friend.
[01:22:34.460 --> 01:22:36.580]   Mine is a frivolous toy.
[01:22:36.580 --> 01:22:37.900]   It is Mac related.
[01:22:37.900 --> 01:22:42.780]   The company classic bought their toy designers out of Hong Kong and they make these beautiful
[01:22:42.780 --> 01:22:50.820]   like mini fig versions of the classic Mac and now the the the Bondi blue iMac and they're
[01:22:50.820 --> 01:22:52.700]   about the they're about the size of a lemon.
[01:22:52.700 --> 01:22:54.940]   They're not like tiny, tiny, tiny little things.
[01:22:54.940 --> 01:22:58.100]   They've got magnetic poseable like arms and legs.
[01:22:58.100 --> 01:23:01.220]   The classic the classic Mac comes with a font D.A.
[01:23:01.220 --> 01:23:08.220]   Movers suitcase and the original mouse.
[01:23:08.220 --> 01:23:09.220]   This is so cute.
[01:23:09.220 --> 01:23:11.460]   Alex Gumpel had a few of these I think they were really great.
[01:23:11.460 --> 01:23:12.460]   I really love this.
[01:23:12.460 --> 01:23:14.100]   They've been out for a while.
[01:23:14.100 --> 01:23:17.740]   I only discovered them like a couple weeks ago.
[01:23:17.740 --> 01:23:20.580]   I order when it hasn't arrived yet, but I had it ordered.
[01:23:20.580 --> 01:23:21.580]   I love it.
[01:23:21.580 --> 01:23:24.380]   It's carrying the font suitcase that cracks me up.
[01:23:24.380 --> 01:23:25.380]   Yeah.
[01:23:25.380 --> 01:23:32.860]   So if you if you have a few like action figures or like collectible like mini figurine sculptures,
[01:23:32.860 --> 01:23:38.140]   I just want the classic Mac to be able to you know play with my Captain America and play
[01:23:38.140 --> 01:23:43.540]   with my Tigra and play with my Iron Man and that's be be be be their own superhero team
[01:23:43.540 --> 01:23:49.220]   together like a more or a Marvel team up like cat woman and the and the and the black classic
[01:23:49.220 --> 01:23:52.580]   bought that think that I think they could go on adventures together.
[01:23:52.580 --> 01:23:55.060]   They feel like they should don't they show my screen.
[01:23:55.060 --> 01:24:04.380]   Carsten, this is the one with the back classic with the it's so cute and a little mouse.
[01:24:04.380 --> 01:24:05.380]   So cute.
[01:24:05.380 --> 01:24:09.020]   There's not actually figures can use computers now.
[01:24:09.020 --> 01:24:10.420]   They're not completely cheap.
[01:24:10.420 --> 01:24:14.140]   $31, but that's inexpensive enough that you could have a few on your.
[01:24:14.140 --> 01:24:16.420]   Well, unfortunately, there's nothing to show scale.
[01:24:16.420 --> 01:24:19.580]   It's not you think that it might be like something comes out of a gumball machine, but
[01:24:19.580 --> 01:24:26.220]   it's about like a big and so you can actually like it's they do interact very, very well,
[01:24:26.220 --> 01:24:32.940]   I think with your with your action figures and other other parts of the of your puppet
[01:24:32.940 --> 01:24:33.940]   land playhouse.
[01:24:33.940 --> 01:24:36.460]   Here's the the Susan care classic Mac.

[01:24:42.060 --> 01:24:46.860]   And then you make someone make a stop motion animation with all these things and host links
[01:24:46.860 --> 01:24:47.860]   to them.
[01:24:47.860 --> 01:24:50.460]   Here's a trash bot pin.

[01:25:12.060 --> 01:25:14.340]   Lori, what do you have for us?
[01:25:14.340 --> 01:25:19.340]   You're cute.
[01:25:19.340 --> 01:25:22.540]   I'll go to Renee instead.
[01:25:22.540 --> 01:25:23.780]   You can buy some bins.
[01:25:23.780 --> 01:25:25.300]   Renee, Richie, you're pick of the week.
[01:25:25.300 --> 01:25:26.300]   Do you have this?
[01:25:26.300 --> 01:25:28.740]   So do the bots?
[01:25:28.740 --> 01:25:29.740]   No.
[01:25:29.740 --> 01:25:31.820]   Oh, do I have the do I have the pick of the week?
[01:25:31.820 --> 01:25:32.820]   Absolutely.
[01:25:32.820 --> 01:25:33.820]   Yes.
[01:25:33.820 --> 01:25:35.780]   This is we're just talking about this, actually.
[01:25:35.780 --> 01:25:40.860]   This is the this is the movie that was so long that you had to plan your P breaks.
[01:25:40.860 --> 01:25:47.340]   Well, I mean, it's not Harry Potter and the Cursed Child Long, but it is long.
[01:25:47.340 --> 01:25:48.340]   True confession.
[01:25:48.340 --> 01:25:52.380]   I didn't like it the first time that I saw it because Avengers Infinity War is one of
[01:25:52.380 --> 01:25:55.260]   my favorite movies of all time.
[01:25:55.260 --> 01:25:59.380]   And I went into this movie expecting that even though they told me not to.
[01:25:59.380 --> 01:26:02.820]   Even though they said it's not Infinity War Part 2, we deliberately made that decision.
[01:26:02.820 --> 01:26:03.820]   It's a very different movie.
[01:26:03.820 --> 01:26:07.860]   I went in expecting to have Infinity War Part 2 and I didn't get it.
[01:26:07.860 --> 01:26:09.500]   I got something very different.
[01:26:09.500 --> 01:26:12.740]   And that difference and expectation maybe not really like it.
[01:26:12.740 --> 01:26:13.740]   But then I thought about it.
[01:26:13.740 --> 01:26:15.820]   I went back and watched it a second time.
[01:26:15.820 --> 01:26:18.180]   It is by far not my favorite Marvel movie.
[01:26:18.180 --> 01:26:22.820]   There is a bunch of Marvel movies I would rank way higher than this just subjectively.
[01:26:22.820 --> 01:26:29.380]   But what Marvel and Kevin Fehe and that whole team specifically has managed to accomplish
[01:26:29.380 --> 01:26:34.420]   through like 11 years and 22 movies is just unprecedented.
[01:26:34.420 --> 01:26:39.500]   And whether you like some of them, all of them, none of them, just the amount of work
[01:26:39.500 --> 01:26:42.660]   in a Hollywood studio system.
[01:26:42.660 --> 01:26:49.940]   Dealing with Hollywood actors and agents and production schedules and studios and executives,
[01:26:49.940 --> 01:26:54.540]   it is hard enough to get a sequel made or never mind the first movie made.
[01:26:54.540 --> 01:26:59.980]   But to get a quasi cohesive universe of all these movies.
[01:26:59.980 --> 01:27:03.540]   And then I just watched the director's commentary and I was one of those people I would love
[01:27:03.540 --> 01:27:05.140]   to movie like why don't they just do this?
[01:27:05.140 --> 01:27:06.300]   They could have done that.
[01:27:06.300 --> 01:27:09.460]   And then the director's commentary which I often prefer to the movies that I watch because
[01:27:09.460 --> 01:27:12.540]   I'm a real geek about making of stuff.
[01:27:12.540 --> 01:27:16.460]   They said well we could have done my brilliant idea but it didn't pay off for these or those
[01:27:16.460 --> 01:27:18.260]   reasons or conflicted with this or that.
[01:27:18.260 --> 01:27:20.060]   I'm like okay, that's all fair.
[01:27:20.060 --> 01:27:24.900]   But it really does if you go back and track the early movies and the journeys of all these
[01:27:24.900 --> 01:27:26.220]   characters.
[01:27:26.220 --> 01:27:31.740]   It pays off so many things in so many ways that it has all the fans service and the little
[01:27:31.740 --> 01:27:35.460]   things that only people who've read the comics for 30 years would get.
[01:27:35.460 --> 01:27:38.940]   But it also has the jokes that mainstream audiences like.
[01:27:38.940 --> 01:27:43.980]   And you may not ultimately agree with every decision they made but almost every character
[01:27:43.980 --> 01:27:50.180]   gets that moment that shows a diametric opposition to where they started from in the Marvel universe.
[01:27:50.180 --> 01:27:54.740]   And I just think putting this all together, yes, it's three hours and they could have arguably
[01:27:54.740 --> 01:27:56.100]   trimmed it down.
[01:27:56.100 --> 01:28:01.460]   But they pay off so much that especially if you've watched other movies along the way,
[01:28:01.460 --> 01:28:05.180]   this is just a beautiful, beautiful, poetic ending.
[01:28:05.180 --> 01:28:07.580]   I've only seen at best half of these.
[01:28:07.580 --> 01:28:12.900]   I want to buy all 22 in a bundle and then watch them all.
[01:28:12.900 --> 01:28:14.140]   When can I do that?
[01:28:14.140 --> 01:28:16.940]   The other thing that's such a challenge is they get like Ant-Man which is, wouldn't that
[01:28:16.940 --> 01:28:17.940]   be awesome?
[01:28:17.940 --> 01:28:21.540]   He got like Guardians and Ant-Man which are goofy, goofy movies in there with like the
[01:28:21.540 --> 01:28:25.020]   super serious characters and it just, the actors are so good.
[01:28:25.020 --> 01:28:26.780]   Like Paul Rudd and all the actors are so good.
[01:28:26.780 --> 01:28:28.740]   It just works.
[01:28:28.740 --> 01:28:32.460]   So it's a terrific good time especially if you watch all the extras which has been so
[01:28:32.460 --> 01:28:33.460]   much.
[01:28:33.460 --> 01:28:37.660]   I'm going to watch all 22 in order.
[01:28:37.660 --> 01:28:41.620]   And not as a major spoiler but there's like deleted scenes where like Rocket is going,
[01:28:41.620 --> 01:28:43.820]   oh you fought the Tatari, how long did that take you?
[01:28:43.820 --> 01:28:45.300]   And they're like, oh two, three hours like, what?
[01:28:45.300 --> 01:28:46.660]   They're the worst army in the world.
[01:28:46.660 --> 01:28:48.700]   You just blew up their command ship and they all fall down.
[01:28:48.700 --> 01:28:49.700]   Didn't you know that?
[01:28:49.700 --> 01:28:50.700]   Everybody knows that.
[01:28:50.700 --> 01:28:53.940]   And they sort of like pull, they sort of make fun of the bad decisions that they made
[01:28:53.940 --> 01:28:54.940]   along the way.
[01:28:54.940 --> 01:28:55.940]   Which I thought was the light.
[01:28:55.940 --> 01:28:56.940]   That's good.
[01:28:56.940 --> 01:28:57.940]   Yeah.
[01:28:57.940 --> 01:28:59.940]   So you really do have to watch all 22 movies.
[01:28:59.940 --> 01:29:00.940]   Yeah.
[01:29:00.940 --> 01:29:03.460]   I have no grounding in this universe at all.
[01:29:03.460 --> 01:29:05.500]   You don't live too but you'll get more payoff.
[01:29:05.500 --> 01:29:08.500]   I know even less about Marvel comics than I do about Pokemon.
[01:29:08.500 --> 01:29:10.540]   So I'm really at a loss here.
[01:29:10.540 --> 01:29:11.540]   Maybe I need to.
[01:29:11.540 --> 01:29:13.620]   Would you do this for me Renee?
[01:29:13.620 --> 01:29:17.820]   Prescribe a reading and watching regimen.
[01:29:17.820 --> 01:29:19.220]   I did this for Lori.
[01:29:19.220 --> 01:29:20.220]   I have the list.
[01:29:20.220 --> 01:29:22.860]   I did this for Lori when we were together at Dub Dub.
[01:29:22.860 --> 01:29:25.060]   And how did it work Lori?
[01:29:25.060 --> 01:29:27.940]   Well I think I've seen two of the ones on the list they gave me so far.
[01:29:27.940 --> 01:29:28.940]   So it's working.
[01:29:28.940 --> 01:29:29.940]   I'm getting there.
[01:29:29.940 --> 01:29:30.940]   I'm just getting it.
[01:29:30.940 --> 01:29:31.940]   It's a long haul.
[01:29:31.940 --> 01:29:34.740]   It's kind of like a four year degree.
[01:29:34.740 --> 01:29:38.940]   When you get towards the climax of this movie you see things on screen that every five
[01:29:38.940 --> 01:29:41.940]   year old comic book fan has waited their entire lives.
[01:29:41.940 --> 01:29:42.940]   See that's why.
[01:29:42.940 --> 01:29:43.940]   I was leaving that they would see.
[01:29:43.940 --> 01:29:46.460]   That's why I don't want to spoil it.
[01:29:46.460 --> 01:29:47.540]   That's why I need to do the whole thing.
[01:29:47.540 --> 01:29:49.140]   It's like the Harry Potter show you saw.
[01:29:49.140 --> 01:29:50.900]   You finally saw the Cursed Child on Broadway.
[01:29:50.900 --> 01:29:57.940]   It's a six hour two part Broadway show that requires a deep knowledge and understanding
[01:29:57.940 --> 01:29:59.780]   of the Harry Potter universe.
[01:29:59.780 --> 01:30:00.780]   Even Deathly Hallows.
[01:30:00.780 --> 01:30:03.420]   If you really want to appreciate Deathly Hallows you have to go along for the draw.
[01:30:03.420 --> 01:30:07.260]   I like for the ride otherwise you don't understand all the mythos in me.
[01:30:07.260 --> 01:30:11.500]   I understand that and I would like to be a participant in the Marvel comic universe.
[01:30:11.500 --> 01:30:13.540]   Is this the last Marvel comic universe movie?
[01:30:13.540 --> 01:30:16.740]   No but they've had Spider-Man Homecoming.
[01:30:16.740 --> 01:30:20.540]   Far from Home since then which is sort of a cotter sill to this because it deals with
[01:30:20.540 --> 01:30:22.180]   all the fallout of this.
[01:30:22.180 --> 01:30:24.820]   But everything from now is going to be sort of a fresh beginning.
[01:30:24.820 --> 01:30:27.340]   And they're going to be handing off to a.
[01:30:27.340 --> 01:30:31.540]   No they're just like they had a big announcement at Comic-Con where they announced the next
[01:30:31.540 --> 01:30:35.980]   slide of movies and they're doing Disney+ TV shows with the actors from the movies.
[01:30:35.980 --> 01:30:36.980]   Like it's Tom Hill.
[01:30:36.980 --> 01:30:40.580]   Like it's the guy who played Loki the guy who played Hawkeye the people who played Wanda
[01:30:40.580 --> 01:30:45.220]   and Vision are all doing TV shows where they sort of hand things over to the comic book
[01:30:45.220 --> 01:30:46.220]   next generation.
[01:30:46.220 --> 01:30:47.220]   Which would be interesting.
[01:30:47.220 --> 01:30:48.220]   It'll be a fresh start.
[01:30:48.220 --> 01:30:51.660]   Re-send me what you sent Laurie because I have some work to do.
[01:30:51.660 --> 01:30:52.660]   I'll do that.
[01:30:52.660 --> 01:30:53.660]   You got some movies to watch.
[01:30:53.660 --> 01:30:54.660]   I got some movies.
[01:30:54.660 --> 01:30:59.300]   I think I've watched probably not even half of them.
[01:30:59.300 --> 01:31:00.860]   I know what you mean.
[01:31:00.860 --> 01:31:02.380]   I'll just add this as an ending.
[01:31:02.380 --> 01:31:06.300]   When I was watching the end of this movie in a movie theater my god son looked up and
[01:31:06.300 --> 01:31:09.380]   he said what is wrong with you and I said you don't understand how long I waited to
[01:31:09.380 --> 01:31:10.380]   see this.
[01:31:10.380 --> 01:31:11.380]   Were you crying?
[01:31:11.380 --> 01:31:13.020]   It was worse than crying Leo.
[01:31:13.020 --> 01:31:15.180]   It was like I was having a complete nerd breakdown.
[01:31:15.180 --> 01:31:19.060]   It's just like what I'm going to describe is like when you first saw The Matrix and you
[01:31:19.060 --> 01:31:23.380]   first saw Lord of the Rings when they did the massive technology it was things I had
[01:31:23.380 --> 01:31:25.660]   never seen on screen before.
[01:31:25.660 --> 01:31:30.020]   And this I'd seen the special effects on screen before but these were my mythology.
[01:31:30.020 --> 01:31:35.380]   The mythology that I grew up with as a kid finally presented as like what I imagine.
[01:31:35.380 --> 01:31:36.380]   No I understand.
[01:31:36.380 --> 01:31:37.380]   Yeah.
[01:31:37.380 --> 01:31:38.380]   Not only clearly.
[01:31:38.380 --> 01:31:43.900]   There were moments in Game of Thrones where something that had happened eight, five seasons
[01:31:43.900 --> 01:31:49.300]   ago got resolved and I'm going oh my god and Lisa's saying what?
[01:31:49.300 --> 01:31:53.020]   And I said well yeah you can't you just can't explain it.
[01:31:53.020 --> 01:31:56.300]   Even like Justice League for as many production problems as it had and issues that people
[01:31:56.300 --> 01:32:00.220]   have with it when you when you see them all together and you hear those chords from John
[01:32:00.220 --> 01:32:02.460]   Williams like you are instantly five years old.
[01:32:02.460 --> 01:32:03.460]   So I envy you.
[01:32:03.460 --> 01:32:06.860]   I wish I had read all those comics and seen all those shows.
[01:32:06.860 --> 01:32:07.860]   I envy you.
[01:32:07.860 --> 01:32:08.860]   Well I can watch All Star Superman.
[01:32:08.860 --> 01:32:12.620]   It's like if you know Superman it just is a transformative experience.
[01:32:12.620 --> 01:32:14.820]   It's this big payoff.
[01:32:14.820 --> 01:32:20.220]   Laurie have you ordered your ceramic pins, your classic bots or you ready to do?
[01:32:20.220 --> 01:32:21.220]   I'm ready.
[01:32:21.220 --> 01:32:22.220]   Okay.
[01:32:22.220 --> 01:32:23.220]   Are Pick of the Week from Laurie?
[01:32:23.220 --> 01:32:24.220]   Sorry.
[01:32:24.220 --> 01:32:25.220]   No no no.
[01:32:25.220 --> 01:32:26.220]   They were so cute I had to get.
[01:32:26.220 --> 01:32:27.220]   I do that on this show all the time.
[01:32:27.220 --> 01:32:28.220]   I'm doing it now.
[01:32:28.220 --> 01:32:31.580]   I buy stuff all the time on this show.
[01:32:31.580 --> 01:32:36.060]   So you may have noticed that I'm back in my own environment again.
[01:32:36.060 --> 01:32:37.060]   Yay welcome home.
[01:32:37.060 --> 01:32:39.340]   You put the roof back on.
[01:32:39.340 --> 01:32:40.340]   Yay.
[01:32:40.340 --> 01:32:42.420]   In addition to a new roof,
[01:32:42.420 --> 01:32:44.180]   we got a new thermostat.
[01:32:44.180 --> 01:32:45.920]   We got the E.
[01:32:45.920 --> 01:32:46.740]   Echo B.
[01:32:46.740 --> 01:32:47.740]   E.
[01:32:47.740 --> 01:32:48.580]   Gobe 5.
[01:32:48.580 --> 01:32:49.880]   Oh!
[01:32:49.880 --> 01:32:50.880]   And so I wanted to drop that one in there.
[01:32:50.880 --> 01:32:51.620]   I have never had a smart thermostat.
[01:32:51.620 --> 01:32:53.220]   This is my first one.
[01:32:53.220 --> 01:32:54.420]   So I don't have anything to compare it to.
[01:32:54.420 --> 01:32:56.920]   I'm not saying it's better than x, y, and z.
[01:32:56.920 --> 01:33:01.280]   But I'm definitely saying I absolutely love having it.
[01:33:01.280 --> 01:33:01.540]   And the
[01:33:01.540 --> 01:33:05.460]   Yupobe, I keep thinking E.
[01:33:05.460 --> 01:33:06.520]   Gobe, but it's definitely--
[01:33:06.520 --> 01:33:07.540]   I see it's E.
[01:33:07.540 --> 01:33:08.980]   Gobe, yeah.
[01:33:08.980 --> 01:33:10.180]   E. Gobe 5 is great.
[01:33:10.180 --> 01:33:13.460]   It has voice assistant, which I actually didn't turn on
[01:33:13.460 --> 01:33:22.140]   because it's not for iPhone voice assistant.
[01:33:22.140 --> 01:33:26.260]   But if you use that, if you use Amazon's virtual assistant,
[01:33:26.260 --> 01:33:28.340]   it supports that.
[01:33:28.340 --> 01:33:30.220]   It was so easy to set up.
[01:33:30.220 --> 01:33:31.900]   I literally did it myself.
[01:33:31.900 --> 01:33:35.140]   I didn't have to have an electricity compound do it.
[01:33:35.140 --> 01:33:36.540]   But let me ask you.
[01:33:36.540 --> 01:33:43.380]   Do you have that wire, the control wire in your setup?
[01:33:43.380 --> 01:33:45.780]   Because our house was re-roofed.
[01:33:45.780 --> 01:33:48.020]   My landlord actually put in a brand new air conditioner
[01:33:48.020 --> 01:33:49.020]   because people-- Oh, good.
[01:33:49.020 --> 01:33:50.460]   --was 30 years old.
[01:33:50.460 --> 01:33:54.300]   So I asked you specifically to grab a 5 wire and run that.
[01:33:54.300 --> 01:33:56.460]   And so, yes, luckily mine has that.
[01:33:56.460 --> 01:33:58.140]   If you have that, all of these things
[01:33:58.140 --> 01:33:59.700]   are relatively easy to stuff.
[01:33:59.700 --> 01:34:01.340]   You don't have it.
[01:34:01.340 --> 01:34:03.300]   It's a big pain in the butt.
[01:34:03.300 --> 01:34:07.700]   Well, the E. Gobe 5 comes with-- and maybe the Ford is too--
[01:34:07.700 --> 01:34:09.300]   it comes with a little adapter.
[01:34:09.300 --> 01:34:10.380]   Wireless module?
[01:34:10.380 --> 01:34:14.940]   So if you don't have that, you connect this adapter
[01:34:14.940 --> 01:34:15.980]   into those wires.
[01:34:15.980 --> 01:34:19.100]   And then you use the adapter instead of the wires.
[01:34:19.100 --> 01:34:23.260]   So it is a little more complicated, but not by a lot.
[01:34:23.260 --> 01:34:26.220]   It's actually pretty.
[01:34:26.220 --> 01:34:29.380]   I would say even if you don't have the common wire,
[01:34:29.380 --> 01:34:30.500]   that's the wire that not every--
[01:34:30.500 --> 01:34:32.940]   Common wires, yeah.
[01:34:32.940 --> 01:34:36.260]   Yeah, even if you don't have that, the adapter,
[01:34:36.260 --> 01:34:39.460]   that just comes with-- I still have it because I didn't need it.
[01:34:39.460 --> 01:34:42.340]   So the adapter that comes with the packaging,
[01:34:42.340 --> 01:34:45.340]   you have to cut a larger hole in your wall
[01:34:45.340 --> 01:34:49.100]   because it's about, you know, yay big.
[01:34:49.100 --> 01:34:51.300]   And you shove that into the wall.
[01:34:51.300 --> 01:34:54.060]   And-- Oh, it's bigger than your existing back plate.
[01:34:54.060 --> 01:34:57.300]   You have to put a hole in it.
[01:34:57.300 --> 01:35:00.980]   Well, you know, like-- Oh, for the-- oh, I see for the remote unit.
[01:35:00.980 --> 01:35:01.660]   Yeah.
[01:35:01.660 --> 01:35:02.180]   Yeah.
[01:35:02.180 --> 01:35:05.580]   So, yeah, so the hole that I had was just big enough
[01:35:05.580 --> 01:35:08.460]   to fit just your regular cable wire.
[01:35:08.460 --> 01:35:11.580]   So if you were going to use the adapter, it's about this.
[01:35:11.580 --> 01:35:13.100]   So you have to shove it through that.
[01:35:13.100 --> 01:35:14.820]   And it's so it's hidden in the wall.
[01:35:14.820 --> 01:35:16.820]   It doesn't show or anything like that.
[01:35:16.820 --> 01:35:20.100]   And that thing becomes your new version of the 5-wire
[01:35:20.100 --> 01:35:21.540]   that has the common wire on it.
[01:35:21.540 --> 01:35:23.420]   The common wire gives you power.
[01:35:23.420 --> 01:35:26.940]   So without that, these powered thermostats won't work right.
[01:35:26.940 --> 01:35:27.500]   They don't work.
[01:35:27.500 --> 01:35:28.500]   Yeah.
[01:35:28.500 --> 01:35:28.980]   Yeah.
[01:35:28.980 --> 01:35:31.220]   But you can use these adapters with--
[01:35:31.220 --> 01:35:33.340]   and you put batteries in the adapter,
[01:35:33.340 --> 01:35:35.620]   I presume, to give it power.
[01:35:35.620 --> 01:35:37.140]   Yeah, don't even have it in front of me.
[01:35:37.140 --> 01:35:38.140]   If that's how these remotes work.
[01:35:38.140 --> 01:35:38.500]   No, for sure.
[01:35:38.500 --> 01:35:39.820]   But I'm going to say yes.
[01:35:39.820 --> 01:35:40.780]   Yeah.
[01:35:40.780 --> 01:35:41.620]   Good.
[01:35:41.620 --> 01:35:44.740]   And you control your air conditioning and your heating.
[01:35:44.740 --> 01:35:45.500]   Absolutely.
[01:35:45.500 --> 01:35:49.220]   And it's the greatest thing you can set.
[01:35:49.220 --> 01:35:50.460]   It comes with so much.
[01:35:50.460 --> 01:35:52.620]   But yes, for one thing, you can use--
[01:35:52.620 --> 01:35:53.700]   it supports home kits.
[01:35:53.700 --> 01:35:59.060]   So you can use your iPhone voice assistant from your phone
[01:35:59.060 --> 01:36:00.620]   to adjust the temperature.
[01:36:00.620 --> 01:36:03.500]   You can also set schedules throughout the day
[01:36:03.500 --> 01:36:08.220]   of when you want it to be different temperatures or on or off.
[01:36:08.220 --> 01:36:10.780]   We have peak pricing here in Sacramento.
[01:36:10.780 --> 01:36:13.180]   So I make sure that the air conditioner isn't
[01:36:13.180 --> 01:36:15.660]   running during those peak times.
[01:36:15.660 --> 01:36:19.780]   You can set a threshold of if it gets to be a certain cold
[01:36:19.780 --> 01:36:21.100]   or it gets to be a certain hot.
[01:36:21.100 --> 01:36:22.220]   It will trigger.
[01:36:22.220 --> 01:36:23.580]   And then you can manually set them.
[01:36:23.580 --> 01:36:26.220]   You can set things for a while you're on vacation.
[01:36:26.220 --> 01:36:29.180]   And you can keep an eye on it from your iPhone
[01:36:29.180 --> 01:36:30.500]   while you're out and about.
[01:36:30.500 --> 01:36:33.100]   Turn it on while you're out, which I love
[01:36:33.100 --> 01:36:35.340]   if I'm out of the house and forgot to turn it on.
[01:36:35.340 --> 01:36:37.980]   And I know I'm going to be either cold or hot when I get home.
[01:36:37.980 --> 01:36:40.300]   I can make sure that that's on for me.
[01:36:40.300 --> 01:36:43.180]   So I am all about a smart thermostat.
[01:36:43.180 --> 01:36:44.900]   And after I've had it for a couple of minutes,
[01:36:44.900 --> 01:36:48.060]   I'll tell you how well it works with keeping my energy
[01:36:48.060 --> 01:36:49.020]   build down, too.
[01:36:49.020 --> 01:36:50.100]   Yeah.
[01:36:50.100 --> 01:36:51.020]   I think it's kind of cool.
[01:36:51.020 --> 01:36:53.460]   I had the original Nest thermostat.
[01:36:53.460 --> 01:36:56.060]   I never reinstalled it when we moved.
[01:36:56.060 --> 01:36:57.580]   I was like, OK.
[01:36:57.580 --> 01:36:58.580]   Fine.
[01:36:58.580 --> 01:36:59.460]   I can live without it.
[01:36:59.460 --> 01:37:01.740]   But then I found out we don't have a common wire.
[01:37:01.740 --> 01:37:05.660]   So I can't-- I have some pain in the butt to do these.
[01:37:05.660 --> 01:37:08.540]   Someday I'll get together and do it.
[01:37:08.540 --> 01:37:09.900]   You're lucky you got all this up.
[01:37:09.900 --> 01:37:11.180]   I think it's really cool.
[01:37:11.180 --> 01:37:12.900]   It's really great to have that.
[01:37:12.900 --> 01:37:16.260]   And then it's nice to say, turn on-- like that right now.
[01:37:16.260 --> 01:37:18.820]   It'd be nice before we go home to turn on the AC.
[01:37:18.820 --> 01:37:22.260]   So it's a little cooler when we get home.
[01:37:22.260 --> 01:37:25.780]   EcoB5, your pick of the week.
[01:37:25.780 --> 01:37:31.260]   I was going to make my pick of the week the fact that the entire--
[01:37:31.260 --> 01:37:38.100]   I thought I'd steal a little something from Laurie
[01:37:38.100 --> 01:37:40.980]   and make the fact that iTunes was going to offer
[01:37:40.980 --> 01:37:46.140]   the entire tools collection in a couple of weeks.
[01:37:46.140 --> 01:37:48.220]   But then I thought, I don't know anything about music.
[01:37:48.220 --> 01:37:52.700]   So I probably shouldn't make that my pick of the week.
[01:37:52.700 --> 01:37:54.980]   I do have a pick of the week, though, thanks to Carsten,
[01:37:54.980 --> 01:37:57.140]   who wants us to remind everybody.
[01:37:57.140 --> 01:38:00.820]   The Vintage Computer Festival West is coming up.
[01:38:00.820 --> 01:38:05.700]   Yay, August 3rd and 4th at the Computer History Museum.
[01:38:05.700 --> 01:38:08.500]   The Vintage Computer Federation is a user group for people
[01:38:08.500 --> 01:38:11.380]   who collect historic computers.
[01:38:11.380 --> 01:38:14.380]   And you can go to the Computer History Museum in Mountain View,
[01:38:14.380 --> 01:38:17.740]   Saturday from 9 to 6 and Sunday from 9 to 5.30,
[01:38:17.740 --> 01:38:21.980]   and see 10 or more Apple ones up and several of them
[01:38:21.980 --> 01:38:25.340]   up and running, they're going to be celebrating
[01:38:25.340 --> 01:38:26.780]   the 50th anniversary of the moon landing
[01:38:26.780 --> 01:38:30.620]   with a restored Apollo Guidance Computer.
[01:38:30.620 --> 01:38:34.380]   Oh, by the way, there is a great series of YouTube videos
[01:38:34.380 --> 01:38:37.420]   about the restoration of this Apollo Guidance Computer
[01:38:37.420 --> 01:38:42.140]   using the original software, which they're going to museums.
[01:38:42.140 --> 01:38:45.140]   And they have to write all of this brand new software
[01:38:45.140 --> 01:38:49.980]   just to extract the data from these data ropes.
[01:38:49.980 --> 01:38:54.180]   And a lot of the circuitry is, it's not designed to be,
[01:38:54.180 --> 01:38:56.180]   it's a pioneering Apple product
[01:38:56.180 --> 01:38:59.260]   because it was never designed to be repaired by anybody.
[01:38:59.260 --> 01:39:01.780]   It's like all, it's fully potted.
[01:39:01.780 --> 01:39:04.340]   So they have to take X-rays of it to route out
[01:39:04.340 --> 01:39:07.420]   where are these wires going and if these are breaking a wire,
[01:39:07.420 --> 01:39:11.580]   this is so, it is the nerdiest, most fulfilling series
[01:39:11.580 --> 01:39:13.460]   of restoration videos I've ever seen.
[01:39:13.460 --> 01:39:16.500]   And you will be so happy to see how hard these people
[01:39:16.500 --> 01:39:19.660]   are working and how good they are at just getting
[01:39:19.660 --> 01:39:21.500]   this thing up and running again.
[01:39:21.500 --> 01:39:25.540]   Stuff that was bought as a box of an odd job lot
[01:39:25.540 --> 01:39:30.100]   of NASA stuff, stuff at an auction in 1974, 1975
[01:39:30.100 --> 01:39:31.780]   and it's a complete Apollo Guidance,
[01:39:31.780 --> 01:39:33.340]   nearly complete Apollo Guidance Computer.
[01:39:33.340 --> 01:39:35.180]   - This was a project of the Computer History Museum,
[01:39:35.180 --> 01:39:37.620]   which is a great thing, a wonderful thing
[01:39:37.620 --> 01:39:39.180]   to find out more about.
[01:39:39.180 --> 01:39:42.780]   They also will have Commodore 128 Chief Designer,
[01:39:42.780 --> 01:39:44.900]   Bill Herd lecturing on how to understand
[01:39:44.900 --> 01:39:47.160]   and fix the effects of aging and heat
[01:39:47.160 --> 01:39:48.980]   of electric components.
[01:39:48.980 --> 01:39:53.980]   So wow, this is for the hardcore nerd.
[01:39:53.980 --> 01:39:56.620]   And this sounds like so much fun.
[01:39:56.620 --> 01:39:59.140]   This weekend at the Computer History Museum,
[01:39:59.140 --> 01:40:02.780]   the Vintage Computer Festival West.
[01:40:02.780 --> 01:40:05.620]   Thank you Carson for pointing that out.
[01:40:05.620 --> 01:40:08.840]   I'm really glad to give them a plug and mention this.
[01:40:08.840 --> 01:40:12.180]   The Midwest Vintage Computer Festival is in September.
[01:40:12.180 --> 01:40:15.780]   You can find out more about that at vcfed,
[01:40:15.780 --> 01:40:18.380]   vcfed.org.
[01:40:18.380 --> 01:40:23.380]   V-C-F-E-D.org, the Vintage Computer Federation.
[01:40:23.380 --> 01:40:27.900]   And yes, the entire tools collection will be on iTunes.
[01:40:27.900 --> 01:40:30.700]   Is that good music?
[01:40:30.700 --> 01:40:31.540]   I don't know.
[01:40:31.540 --> 01:40:32.380]   Is it classical?
[01:40:32.380 --> 01:40:33.220]   Is it like Bach?
[01:40:33.220 --> 01:40:34.060]   I don't know.
[01:40:34.060 --> 01:40:34.860]   - I am not gonna make any enemies,
[01:40:34.860 --> 01:40:35.860]   so I'm not gonna say anything.
[01:40:35.860 --> 01:40:36.700]   - You don't like it.
[01:40:36.700 --> 01:40:37.580]   (laughing)
[01:40:37.580 --> 01:40:39.380]   I said I'm not gonna say anything.
[01:40:39.380 --> 01:40:42.220]   - Interesting.
[01:40:42.220 --> 01:40:44.580]   Okay, we'll play some.
[01:40:44.580 --> 01:40:46.460]   If we got a Jim Dowrymple on,
[01:40:46.460 --> 01:40:48.020]   I'm sure he'd wanna recommend that.
[01:40:48.900 --> 01:40:50.740]   Thank you everybody for being here.
[01:40:50.740 --> 01:40:52.980]   We do Mac Break Weekly every Tuesday,
[01:40:52.980 --> 01:40:54.100]   right after iOS today.
[01:40:54.100 --> 01:40:57.580]   You can make the whole day your kind of an Apple day.
[01:40:57.580 --> 01:41:01.460]   If you stop by, twit.tv/live.
[01:41:01.460 --> 01:41:02.500]   Usually Mac Break,
[01:41:02.500 --> 01:41:05.220]   because it's around 11 a.m. Pacific, 2 p.m. Eastern Time,
[01:41:05.220 --> 01:41:08.780]   1700 UTC, but that time varies depending on how long
[01:41:08.780 --> 01:41:12.220]   and how late Leo is with iOS today.
[01:41:12.220 --> 01:41:13.900]   If you wanna watch it live,
[01:41:13.900 --> 01:41:16.540]   you should also be in the chatroom at IRC.twit.tv.
[01:41:16.540 --> 01:41:18.260]   There, there, 24/7,
[01:41:18.260 --> 01:41:20.340]   chatting along with the shows.
[01:41:20.340 --> 01:41:21.700]   You can also join us in studio
[01:41:21.700 --> 01:41:24.100]   at some visitors today from Texas.
