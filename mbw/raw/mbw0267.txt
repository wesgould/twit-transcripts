[00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:01.800]   And today, there's, in fact, Mac news.
[00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:02.800]   Well, no, there isn't.
[00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:03.300]   I'm sorry.
[00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:03.960]   I'd take it back.
[00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.760]   There's iOS news.
[00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.600]   Joining us right now, we just got off
[00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:10.720]   our live coverage of the Apple event in Cupertino,
[00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:12.720]   Andy Inaco from the Chicago Sun Times.
[00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:13.800]   Hi, Andy.
[00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:14.560]   Hello, Leo.
[00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:16.280]   Not at the Apple event, but in his home,
[00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:17.960]   comfortably ensconced.
[00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:20.240]   Oh, so jealous.
[00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:23.440]   That voice is Ryan Block, who is, in fact, a Cupertino.
[00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:25.960]   Another sip of my delicious, cool, refreshing,
[00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:28.560]   caffeinated beverage, which has 20 bags of toaks
[00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:29.800]   and near my fridge.
[00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:31.560]   Andy, tell me if they've ever done this at an event
[00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:32.520]   that you've been to.
[00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.840]   They had a full breakfast buffet here, like omelets, everything.
[00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:36.840]   They've never done that.
[00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:37.400]   They--
[00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:38.520]   I think they do that.
[00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.040]   When you're in Cupertino, they do that.
[00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:40.540]   Right?
[00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:42.160]   I've never seen them do Cupertino.
[00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:42.960]   They were like freaking out.
[00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.320]   Everybody I talk to at Apple is going to go out to breakfast.
[00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:46.520]   Go have the breakfast.
[00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:48.600]   Usually it's pastry, coffee, and juice.
[00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:48.920]   Exactly.
[00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:50.080]   It's like continental breakfast.
[00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:52.360]   I remember eggs at one Apple event,
[00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:54.680]   but I can't remember the original iPad event.
[00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:55.520]   It doesn't look like sconey.
[00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:57.280]   Tim Cook is clearly a breakfast man.
[00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:59.640]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:03.240]   It's good when he don't have a vegetarian as the CEO anymore.
[00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.440]   It's only bacon, ham steaks, link sausage, patties, sausage.
[00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:07.240]   That's a good point.
[00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:08.120]   That's an excellent point.
[00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:10.920]   You would never had eggs with Steve Jobs there.
[00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:13.840]   Ryan, of course, with GDGT, Gadget.com,
[00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:17.120]   reviews from people who actually know.
[00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:19.440]   And we also have, of course, Alex Lindsey here
[00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:20.240]   from the Pixel course.
[00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:21.520]   So Ryan, we're going to go right to you,
[00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:23.680]   because you are on site.
[00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:25.880]   First of all, what's your initial--
[00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:28.480]   what's your basic sense of the event as a whole?
[00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:30.040]   Yeah, I'm actually still on site.
[00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:31.360]   You want me to turn the camera around?
[00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:32.360]   Yeah.
[00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:33.360]   See here.
[00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:37.000]   Ladies and gentlemen, one infinite loop.
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.200]   We give you the Apple stage.
[00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:39.600]   About 350 people in there.
[00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:44.520]   It was not a huge venue.
[00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:45.120]   No, it's not.
[00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:46.080]   It's the Apple Town Hall.
[00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:48.040]   This is definitely an intimate venue.
[00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:50.880]   So it's pretty tight quarters.
[00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:52.680]   This is where they do some internal meetings.
[00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:57.680]   This is where Steve Jobs love to trash on Android.
[00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:00.720]   They've done a number of product announcements here.
[00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:02.960]   So you come down to the campus.
[00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:05.440]   Security is actually really tight this time,
[00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:09.200]   which is kind of surprising, because it's the Apple campus.
[00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:13.040]   There's not a whole lot going on here other than this today.
[00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:14.120]   So what's your feeling?
[00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:16.200]   I mean, what was the feeling in the room
[00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:18.880]   like Tim Cook, of course, on stage instead of Steve Jobs
[00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:20.800]   Phil Schiller at EQ?
[00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:24.280]   All took the stage to talk about their various areas.
[00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:31.520]   Yeah, Tim was not on stage a ton.
[00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:34.080]   He was really kind of there towards the beginning and the end.
[00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:37.880]   Most of it was Scott Forstall and Phil Schiller.
[00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:41.520]   And Phil actually was the person who announced the 4G S.
[00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:46.360]   So Tim kind of got to tee it up and cap it off.
[00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:50.240]   But he did not have a huge or imposing presence
[00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:52.800]   on this first keynote of his.
[00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:56.760]   So I'm not entirely sure how that kind of came off outside.
[00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:01.360]   I mean, to me, it felt like he was ready to kind of give credit
[00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:01.840]   where he was doing.
[00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:04.680]   He wasn't trying to--
[00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:06.200]   Oh, and we just lost him, unfortunately.
[00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:09.040]   He's on FaceTime from Cupertino.
[00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:10.840]   And as you might imagine, there are a few people
[00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:13.200]   using their iPhones there right now.
[00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:18.080]   Although Apple has its own AT&T cell site on campus
[00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:19.680]   and usually gets pretty good reception there.
[00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:23.160]   We'll get to see if we can get Ryan back on.
[00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:25.400]   I have to say, as we sat through that announcement,
[00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:28.840]   it was an hour and a half, hour and 40 minutes.
[00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:34.040]   Most of it, the traditional recap of how the stores are
[00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:38.480]   doing, how sales are, and really very little new stuff
[00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:38.920]   to announce.
[00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:40.360]   There's Ryan.
[00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:41.800]   I was just saying, it seemed--
[00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:42.920]   And I was watching Twitter--
[00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:43.840]   I don't know what happened.
[00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:46.680]   No, what happened is what always happens.
[00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:48.680]   It's fine.
[00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:50.800]   We'll just keep calling you back.
[00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:52.480]   I was just saying that at least watching
[00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:54.920]   Twitter in our chatroom reaction and our own reaction
[00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:57.160]   here in studio, it was an announcement
[00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:00.080]   that didn't seem to have a lot of excitement around it.
[00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:07.560]   Yeah, I'm going to move to see if I can get a little bit
[00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:08.880]   better on the Wi-Fi.
[00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:11.480]   But yeah, I agree.
[00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:13.360]   It was pretty muted announcement.
[00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:16.000]   I mean, it didn't feel a whole lot different
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.160]   from when Apple launched the 3GS, because obviously,
[00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:20.840]   they're building on an existing product.
[00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:23.440]   So there's no new form factor.
[00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:27.400]   There wasn't anything there that really felt like it
[00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:30.720]   was going to fundamentally change the iPhone experience.
[00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:32.120]   It's really, really cool stuff.
[00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:34.600]   I mean, the Siri integration, I think a lot of people
[00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:36.880]   wonder what was going to happen when they acquired Siri.
[00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:39.680]   And now we kind of know how that turned out.
[00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:41.640]   But I mean, in terms of the phone,
[00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:44.080]   if you've played with an iPhone 4,
[00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:48.880]   it's going to feel a lot like that as the iPhone 3GS
[00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:50.280]   felt to the iPhone 3G.
[00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:55.960]   And down he goes again.
[00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:56.400]   Blair.
[00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:59.200]   Oh, I spoke too soon.
[00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:00.240]   Did they have a ride?
[00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:02.040]   Did they have a demo area?
[00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:02.800]   Apparently not.
[00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:04.920]   Anyway, for you to see or try any of this stuff.
[00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:07.360]   [VIDEO PLAYBACK]
[00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:14.280]   Can you hear me, Ryan?
[00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:15.480]   No, they didn't.
[00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:18.760]   Everything that they were showing was--
[00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:20.600]   Just like that.
[00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:23.000]   And now you know why they ask you to turn off your devices
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.080]   when you go to an Apple event.
[00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:27.480]   Andy, what was your overall feeling
[00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:29.880]   about this announcement?
[00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:32.440]   I think it was-- even if they had gotten
[00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:34.040]   a year before Windows Center, I think they actually
[00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:37.080]   improved the show by taking it to the campus
[00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:38.480]   by making it small.
[00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:40.720]   There wasn't any one thing that really
[00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:44.720]   was a smashing demo, an actual game-changing demo.
[00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:46.280]   Siri, obviously, was the big deal.
[00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:50.080]   But it's not something that phone users are unfamiliar with.
[00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:51.200]   It's certainly not the sort of thing
[00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:53.360]   that people in that room the journalist would have been
[00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:54.760]   unfamiliar with.
[00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:57.240]   So I think that had they decided to get out the dog
[00:06:57.240 --> 00:06:59.840]   and the pony for this one, there
[00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:02.040]   would have been kind of a set of a letdown.
[00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:04.120]   I think that the 4S is a nice phone.
[00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:05.840]   If I were nearing the end of my contract,
[00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:08.120]   I'd be tempted to pop a few hundred bucks
[00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:10.240]   to replace my iPhone 4.
[00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:11.920]   I think that--
[00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:14.720]   only speaking as a consumer, I'm not really motivated
[00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:17.720]   to switch right now, given that my current iPhone is only
[00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:19.720]   about a year and a couple months old.
[00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:21.120]   But a great update.
[00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:26.440]   And if iCloud really pays off, then that's
[00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:28.320]   going to be a good level for everybody.
[00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:30.000]   I think it's just great to know that we now
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:31.320]   have a date for when iCloud is going
[00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:33.960]   to go live, when iOS 5 is going to go live.
[00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:36.160]   Because both of those things are going to be free for everybody.
[00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:37.480]   We'll give you one more chance, Ryan,
[00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:39.160]   and we won't bother calling you back again.
[00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:45.640]   But any thoughts at all about this Ryan Block from Gadget.com?
[00:07:45.640 --> 00:07:49.600]   I think I just heard Andy saying that it was great to have
[00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:51.760]   some dates associated with these things.
[00:07:51.760 --> 00:07:52.800]   I totally agree.
[00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:54.600]   I mean, I think we've all been kind of waiting
[00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:56.280]   for a while for iOS 5 at this point.
[00:07:56.280 --> 00:07:57.640]   So that's pretty exciting.
[00:07:57.640 --> 00:07:59.440]   But yeah, I mean, in terms of the announcement,
[00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:03.400]   I don't think anybody's minds were completely blown.
[00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:05.720]   I mean, in terms of voice dictation features
[00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:09.080]   and serialite functionality, I mean, some of that stuff
[00:08:09.080 --> 00:08:11.280]   has been in Android for a while now.
[00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:13.920]   So I think that there's a level of familiarity
[00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:16.400]   with what's currently already on the market.
[00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:18.360]   I think that they moved the ball forward for them.
[00:08:18.360 --> 00:08:21.760]   But I don't know if they've fundamentally changed
[00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:24.240]   the smartphone market this year.
[00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:25.960]   Any Q&A after the announcement?
[00:08:25.960 --> 00:08:28.840]   Or was it that's it and bye-bye?
[00:08:28.840 --> 00:08:31.480]   That's it and bye-bye this time.
[00:08:31.480 --> 00:08:36.200]   Tim, Phil, Eddie, all those guys did not get up on stage
[00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:37.320]   to answer questions.
[00:08:37.320 --> 00:08:40.240]   So I think they hoped that they had kind of gotten everything
[00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:42.200]   out that they needed to.
[00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:44.360]   Was there demo area?
[00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:47.040]   There was some private briefings.
[00:08:47.040 --> 00:08:49.360]   And I think they only showed it to a couple of people,
[00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:51.680]   which I actually found a little bit surprising
[00:08:51.680 --> 00:08:55.920]   because the phone's going to be out in a week or a few days.
[00:08:55.920 --> 00:08:57.200]   And then you know--
[00:08:57.200 --> 00:08:58.920]   or I'm sorry, it's up on pre-order in a few days.
[00:08:58.920 --> 00:09:00.560]   And then it's out in a couple of weeks.
[00:09:00.560 --> 00:09:03.160]   But yeah, no, they didn't have a demo area,
[00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:04.800]   which I was actually expecting, especially
[00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:07.520]   because this is an upgraded iPhone 4, basically.
[00:09:07.520 --> 00:09:09.680]   It's not radically different hardware
[00:09:09.680 --> 00:09:12.360]   that's launching in a couple of months.
[00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:13.400]   Ryan, I'm going to let you go.
[00:09:13.400 --> 00:09:14.880]   Thank you so much for joining us.
[00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:19.680]   gdgt.com for full coverage on the iPhone 4S.
[00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:20.960]   Ryan Block, thanks.
[00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:21.480]   Thanks, Leo.
[00:09:21.480 --> 00:09:22.560]   I appreciate your part of me.
[00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:23.480]   No, that's fine.
[00:09:23.480 --> 00:09:25.400]   We're glad we could talk to you there.
[00:09:25.400 --> 00:09:27.240]   Yeah, you have to say, I think in hindsight,
[00:09:27.240 --> 00:09:29.160]   that probably as you were kind of implying it,
[00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:31.080]   it was good they didn't have Moscone Center.
[00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:32.320]   It wasn't a big announcement.
[00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:35.520]   It was just kind of an incremental improvement.
[00:09:35.520 --> 00:09:38.680]   Apple, you and I were talking in the men's room
[00:09:38.680 --> 00:09:40.400]   before the show.
[00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:40.920]   I think we--
[00:09:40.920 --> 00:09:41.840]   I wasn't going to mention that point.
[00:09:41.840 --> 00:09:44.480]   We both agreed, though, that Apple's--
[00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:46.360]   and this is what they've done the last few times they did
[00:09:46.360 --> 00:09:47.600]   with the iPad 2 announcement.
[00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:49.880]   They're just doing the minimum to get you to upgrade.
[00:09:49.880 --> 00:09:51.600]   And someone asked me before they announced what they asked
[00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:52.400]   me two days ago.
[00:09:52.400 --> 00:09:54.040]   So what would it take for you to buy a new phone?
[00:09:54.040 --> 00:09:57.360]   I said, well, voice activation faster, processor,
[00:09:57.360 --> 00:09:58.240]   and a camera.
[00:09:58.240 --> 00:10:00.120]   And then, you know, an 8 megabyte camera.
[00:10:00.120 --> 00:10:03.080]   So they hit exactly what the minimum required-- minimum.
[00:10:03.080 --> 00:10:04.120]   Like, I'm not running.
[00:10:04.120 --> 00:10:05.120]   I'm not excited.
[00:10:05.120 --> 00:10:07.680]   But I'm like, well, it's enough for me to upgrade.
[00:10:07.680 --> 00:10:08.840]   I want to play with it.
[00:10:08.840 --> 00:10:13.280]   You think he's telling that they said that Siri was beta?
[00:10:13.280 --> 00:10:15.720]   That's not even the finished version of Siri?
[00:10:15.720 --> 00:10:16.920]   Yeah.
[00:10:16.920 --> 00:10:19.880]   Isn't that unusual for them to be showing off anything
[00:10:19.880 --> 00:10:22.040]   that they're not willing to--
[00:10:22.040 --> 00:10:26.240]   if they're-- usually, they would avoid words like that.
[00:10:26.240 --> 00:10:29.160]   There would be an implication that this is shipping in 10 days.
[00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:31.000]   And maybe this is not the finished thing.
[00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:33.040]   But they would let people sort of guess that.
[00:10:33.040 --> 00:10:34.880]   They wouldn't say, oh, we're showing you something that
[00:10:34.880 --> 00:10:36.080]   isn't really finished yet.
[00:10:36.080 --> 00:10:39.080]   And boy, if you work at Apple, you're
[00:10:39.080 --> 00:10:40.640]   not going to be seeing much of your spouses or children
[00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:41.440]   over the next 10 days.
[00:10:41.440 --> 00:10:43.400]   Because we have to make sure that that button actually
[00:10:43.400 --> 00:10:44.600]   does something when he's pressing.
[00:10:44.600 --> 00:10:47.080]   We don't think that it'll actually do anything right now.
[00:10:47.080 --> 00:10:48.080]   Yeah.
[00:10:48.080 --> 00:10:50.760]   The only thing I'll say is that I--
[00:10:50.760 --> 00:10:54.120]   in the defense of that is for calling Siri beta,
[00:10:54.120 --> 00:10:56.640]   is that it's sort of a close to rocket thing to do.
[00:10:56.640 --> 00:10:58.560]   But it's a very-- I mean, voice recognition--
[00:10:58.560 --> 00:11:00.160]   I see because it's so server-focused.
[00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:01.360]   Because it's just server-focused.
[00:11:01.360 --> 00:11:02.760]   Why is it so complicated?
[00:11:02.760 --> 00:11:06.760]   Getting-- I mean, it's easy to get basic commands down
[00:11:06.760 --> 00:11:09.320]   with voice activation, but doing what they're talking about here,
[00:11:09.320 --> 00:11:12.000]   where you're doing dictation, where you're doing things--
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:13.600]   it's not going to work perfectly.
[00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:15.000]   It's just that that technology is still--
[00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:16.280]   Then why ship it?
[00:11:16.280 --> 00:11:17.600]   Well, because I think you have to.
[00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:19.360]   I mean, I think that it is--
[00:11:19.360 --> 00:11:21.960]   It's not the app as I-- and he says it's not the Apple way.
[00:11:21.960 --> 00:11:22.920]   But this is why you ship it.
[00:11:22.920 --> 00:11:23.600]   Android.
[00:11:23.600 --> 00:11:25.960]   The Android is that it is amazing.
[00:11:25.960 --> 00:11:30.480]   If I can say drive to blow and banments, it's correct.
[00:11:30.480 --> 00:11:30.960]   It was correct.
[00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:33.560]   I did five or six tests as soon as I got this.
[00:11:33.560 --> 00:11:35.160]   And it's correct every single time.
[00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:36.840]   Here's the video on the Apple site,
[00:11:36.840 --> 00:11:38.880]   which is by the way, been up and down all morning.
[00:11:38.880 --> 00:11:41.600]   And it does not-- it's not looking good,
[00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:43.280]   but I was able to get this video.
[00:11:43.280 --> 00:11:44.320]   It's a five-minute video.
[00:11:44.320 --> 00:11:45.080]   I won't play the whole thing.
[00:11:45.080 --> 00:11:46.760]   But just here's a little bit of how Apple is
[00:11:46.760 --> 00:11:49.200]   positioning the iPhone 4s.
[00:11:49.200 --> 00:11:51.560]   iPhone 4 was groundbreaking.
[00:11:51.560 --> 00:11:54.720]   It's one of the best products we've ever designed.
[00:11:54.720 --> 00:11:57.080]   And it's gone on to become the number one smartphone
[00:11:57.080 --> 00:11:58.600]   in the world.
[00:11:58.600 --> 00:12:00.400]   So we had this challenge.
[00:12:00.400 --> 00:12:02.560]   How do you improve on something that's so extraordinary?
[00:12:02.560 --> 00:12:05.400]   That's Jaws, but with iPhone 4s, we did exactly that.
[00:12:05.400 --> 00:12:06.320]   Good product guy.
[00:12:06.320 --> 00:12:09.600]   I'm taking this amazing design and completely rethinking
[00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:11.760]   the inside.
[00:12:11.760 --> 00:12:14.920]   We started by adding the dual core A5 chip, which
[00:12:14.920 --> 00:12:17.040]   is up to twice as fast.
[00:12:17.040 --> 00:12:19.520]   Then we completely redesigned the camera,
[00:12:19.520 --> 00:12:21.480]   which not only has 8 megapixels--
[00:12:21.480 --> 00:12:22.840]   Strikes me.
[00:12:22.840 --> 00:12:25.240]   They could have just shown this video and saved us all
[00:12:25.240 --> 00:12:25.800]   a lot of time.
[00:12:25.800 --> 00:12:30.120]   Yeah, with over 200 new features and iCloud.
[00:12:30.120 --> 00:12:33.200]   And now we're introducing Siri.
[00:12:33.200 --> 00:12:35.160]   How can I help you?
[00:12:35.160 --> 00:12:38.520]   Siri is a whole new way of interacting with your iPhone
[00:12:38.520 --> 00:12:40.920]   using just your voice.
[00:12:40.920 --> 00:12:44.320]   Find me an Italian restaurant in North Beach.
[00:12:44.320 --> 00:12:48.040]   OK, these 25 Italian restaurants are in North Beach.
[00:12:48.040 --> 00:12:50.400]   It's like this amazing assistant that
[00:12:50.400 --> 00:12:54.040]   listens to you, understands you, can answer your questions.
[00:12:54.040 --> 00:12:56.240]   It could even accomplish tasks for you.
[00:12:56.240 --> 00:12:59.720]   Move my meeting with Kelly Altec to 12.
[00:12:59.720 --> 00:13:03.120]   Note that you already have a meeting about budgets at 12 PM.
[00:13:03.120 --> 00:13:04.840]   Shall I schedule this anyway?
[00:13:04.840 --> 00:13:06.160]   Move it to 2.
[00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:09.360]   A lot of devices can recognize the words you say,
[00:13:09.360 --> 00:13:13.280]   but the ability to understand what you mean and act on it.
[00:13:13.280 --> 00:13:15.200]   That's the breakthrough with Siri.
[00:13:15.200 --> 00:13:16.200]   Read me my text.
[00:13:16.200 --> 00:13:18.200]   New message from Tony Rivas.
[00:13:18.200 --> 00:13:20.480]   Are you going to the party?
[00:13:20.480 --> 00:13:21.320]   Reply.
[00:13:21.320 --> 00:13:24.440]   Yeah, I'll meet you there.
[00:13:24.440 --> 00:13:26.520]   Remind me to grab the present when I get home.
[00:13:26.520 --> 00:13:28.760]   Here's your reminder for when you get home.
[00:13:28.760 --> 00:13:31.840]   It completely changes the way you think about what
[00:13:31.840 --> 00:13:32.840]   a phone can do for you.
[00:13:32.840 --> 00:13:39.200]   One of the biggest advances for the iPhone 4S
[00:13:39.200 --> 00:13:40.520]   is in its performance.
[00:13:40.520 --> 00:13:45.080]   It uses the same powerful dual core A5 chip that's in iPad 2.
[00:13:45.080 --> 00:13:47.440]   With two processors handling the workload,
[00:13:47.440 --> 00:13:49.560]   it really makes a big difference.
[00:13:49.560 --> 00:13:51.920]   Apps will launch and run faster.
[00:13:51.920 --> 00:13:54.440]   Graphics can render up to seven times quicker,
[00:13:54.440 --> 00:13:56.760]   making gameplay a lot better.
[00:13:56.760 --> 00:14:00.960]   And in Safari, web pages will load up to twice as fast.
[00:14:00.960 --> 00:14:04.600]   And it's the world's first phone to intelligently switch
[00:14:04.600 --> 00:14:09.600]   between two antennas to transmit and receive calls.
[00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:12.920]   Is having a response to the CDMA issue of not being
[00:14:12.920 --> 00:14:17.280]   able to do data at the same time as it's making calls?
[00:14:17.280 --> 00:14:21.640]   Yeah, that would-- well, it's I think it's a dual edge thing.
[00:14:21.640 --> 00:14:23.720]   It's a response to the CDMA limitation,
[00:14:23.720 --> 00:14:24.560]   and it's also--
[00:14:24.560 --> 00:14:24.920]   Squirrel.
[00:14:24.920 --> 00:14:25.760]   --quiet.
[00:14:25.760 --> 00:14:26.560]   I'm sorry.
[00:14:26.560 --> 00:14:28.280]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:14:28.280 --> 00:14:30.200]   D-Tame you're not the only one who could take pictures
[00:14:30.200 --> 00:14:31.640]   of squirrels, you know.
[00:14:31.640 --> 00:14:34.320]   Mr. Fancy Pants got the old phone to pick the chicken
[00:14:34.320 --> 00:14:35.200]   and get a squirrel.
[00:14:35.200 --> 00:14:38.840]   I'll continue on.
[00:14:38.840 --> 00:14:41.320]   This is actually-- I'm saying they should have just showed
[00:14:41.320 --> 00:14:43.080]   this video and let everybody go home early.
[00:14:43.080 --> 00:14:45.440]   Can I just say it's a nice use of Adele's rolling
[00:14:45.440 --> 00:14:46.800]   in the deep instrumental?
[00:14:46.800 --> 00:14:47.600]   Is that what that is?
[00:14:47.600 --> 00:14:48.320]   That's what that is.
[00:14:48.320 --> 00:14:49.680]   That's Adele's song.
[00:14:49.680 --> 00:14:50.200]   Huh?
[00:14:50.200 --> 00:14:51.000]   It's instrumental.
[00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:52.360]   I wonder if YouTube is going to fly and get--
[00:14:52.360 --> 00:14:54.480]   DSM and CDMA cups.
[00:14:54.480 --> 00:14:55.720]   I don't know what I did there.
[00:14:55.720 --> 00:14:56.320]   Oh, they're GSS.
[00:14:56.320 --> 00:14:57.160]   Sorry.
[00:14:57.160 --> 00:14:58.800]   Sorry, Bob.
[00:14:58.800 --> 00:15:03.200]   iPhone 4S also has an all-new 8 megapixel camera,
[00:15:03.200 --> 00:15:05.840]   which dramatically increases the amount of detail
[00:15:05.840 --> 00:15:07.040]   in your photos.
[00:15:07.040 --> 00:15:09.640]   But the quality of a photograph isn't just about--
[00:15:09.640 --> 00:15:10.680]   OK, Eileen, who's this?
[00:15:10.680 --> 00:15:12.320]   The optics of the camera are just--
[00:15:12.320 --> 00:15:13.160]   Slee, I don't know.
[00:15:13.160 --> 00:15:13.880]   This is her name.
[00:15:13.880 --> 00:15:15.760]   And we made significant appearance here.
[00:15:15.760 --> 00:15:19.280]   We increased the size of the aperture to let more light in.
[00:15:19.280 --> 00:15:21.640]   We added a fifth lens, which gives you
[00:15:21.640 --> 00:15:23.640]   a sharper image overall.
[00:15:23.640 --> 00:15:26.200]   And the new sensor is designed to capture more light
[00:15:26.200 --> 00:15:27.280]   within each pixel.
[00:15:27.280 --> 00:15:30.240]   So you get far sharper photos with more detail
[00:15:30.240 --> 00:15:31.680]   and more accurate color.
[00:15:31.680 --> 00:15:34.800]   When you see the quality of the photos you get from this camera,
[00:15:34.800 --> 00:15:37.320]   it's hard to believe they came from a mobile phone.
[00:15:37.320 --> 00:15:40.800]   We also know people love to shoot video on their iPhone.
[00:15:40.800 --> 00:15:43.760]   So we've made some big advancements here, too.
[00:15:43.760 --> 00:15:48.960]   iPhone 4S records 1080p HD video and 30 frames per second.
[00:15:48.960 --> 00:15:50.400]   Let me ask you about Alex.
[00:15:50.400 --> 00:15:51.120]   I ask you about that.
[00:15:51.120 --> 00:15:56.120]   The sensor isn't 1,080 lines, or is it?
[00:15:56.120 --> 00:15:57.560]   Is it going to be scaled 1080p?
[00:15:57.560 --> 00:15:58.800]   You know, it's going to be hard to tell.
[00:15:58.800 --> 00:16:00.120]   I mean, there's not pixels there to do it.
[00:16:00.120 --> 00:16:02.320]   But typically, with these little cameras,
[00:16:02.320 --> 00:16:04.880]   there's very little actual sharpness difference
[00:16:04.880 --> 00:16:06.360]   between 1080p and 720p.
[00:16:06.360 --> 00:16:07.880]   So we'll have to-- once we get it, once I get it--
[00:16:07.880 --> 00:16:09.480]   That's been my experience with other phones.
[00:16:09.480 --> 00:16:12.120]   We'll take the two videos and play them side by side.
[00:16:12.120 --> 00:16:15.080]   But a lot of times, 720p-- with the lens that small,
[00:16:15.080 --> 00:16:18.480]   it doesn't resolve to 1080p, particularly effectively.
[00:16:18.480 --> 00:16:22.640]   And oftentimes, the CMOS sensor is being scanned slower
[00:16:22.640 --> 00:16:25.440]   on the 1080p, so there's actually more of the yellow vision
[00:16:25.440 --> 00:16:27.280]   than 720p.
[00:16:27.280 --> 00:16:30.160]   On the tech notes, they're saying explicitly 1080p up
[00:16:30.160 --> 00:16:32.960]   to 30 frames per second with audio.
[00:16:32.960 --> 00:16:34.400]   OK.
[00:16:34.400 --> 00:16:37.760]   The gyro, along with the incredible new software,
[00:16:37.760 --> 00:16:39.080]   will stabilize your video.
[00:16:39.080 --> 00:16:39.840]   That's great.
[00:16:39.840 --> 00:16:40.680]   That's cool.
[00:16:40.680 --> 00:16:42.840]   That's hardware stabilization, not software
[00:16:42.840 --> 00:16:43.360]   statement.
[00:16:43.360 --> 00:16:44.760]   We've taken what was already in a minute.
[00:16:44.760 --> 00:16:46.560]   One with the resolution is going to be when you have
[00:16:46.560 --> 00:16:47.880]   the stabilization turned on, though.
[00:16:47.880 --> 00:16:49.480]   When it drops down to 720p.
[00:16:49.480 --> 00:16:50.040]   Oh, it might.
[00:16:50.040 --> 00:16:50.960]   It might.
[00:16:50.960 --> 00:16:51.680]   Which would be fine.
[00:16:51.680 --> 00:16:52.240]   I would give a--
[00:16:52.240 --> 00:16:52.800]   That's-- yeah.
[00:16:52.800 --> 00:16:53.400]   Absolutely.
[00:16:53.400 --> 00:16:55.160]   That stabilization is huge.
[00:16:55.160 --> 00:16:59.400]   So you use the extra resolution to be able to compensate.
[00:16:59.400 --> 00:17:00.840]   That actually makes a lot of sense.
[00:17:00.840 --> 00:17:02.440]   They say it's software stabilization.
[00:17:02.440 --> 00:17:05.960]   Yes, but it uses the gyroscope, which means it's in fact--
[00:17:05.960 --> 00:17:06.440]   Right.
[00:17:06.440 --> 00:17:07.640]   That's what I mean when I say.
[00:17:07.640 --> 00:17:11.240]   All image stabilization is ultimately software, right?
[00:17:11.240 --> 00:17:11.760]   Well, no, no.
[00:17:11.760 --> 00:17:13.040]   You could have optical--
[00:17:13.040 --> 00:17:14.080]   You could have optical stabilization.
[00:17:14.080 --> 00:17:16.000]   Optical is actually moving the lens according to--
[00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:16.000]   God.
[00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:17.800]   --or, you know, doesn't do that.
[00:17:17.800 --> 00:17:18.320]   I presume.
[00:17:18.320 --> 00:17:20.320]   And what that means is that you're getting the full image,
[00:17:20.320 --> 00:17:21.520]   you know, because the lens is actually
[00:17:21.520 --> 00:17:22.480]   moving to react to it.
[00:17:22.480 --> 00:17:23.920]   And that's usually the most expensive.
[00:17:23.920 --> 00:17:25.640]   That's what you see in a lot of-- I mean, consumer cameras
[00:17:25.640 --> 00:17:26.320]   have that all now.
[00:17:26.320 --> 00:17:27.320]   Right.
[00:17:27.320 --> 00:17:30.160]   You can't do that with a fixed lens, like what you have there.
[00:17:30.160 --> 00:17:33.840]   So it's hybrid, because it's using the gyroscope to note motion,
[00:17:33.840 --> 00:17:36.080]   but then making me compensation.
[00:17:36.080 --> 00:17:37.280]   So what it's not doing is necessarily
[00:17:37.280 --> 00:17:38.760]   using image analyzation to do it.
[00:17:38.760 --> 00:17:39.800]   It's using gyroscope.
[00:17:39.800 --> 00:17:40.300]   Right.
[00:17:40.300 --> 00:17:40.960]   Which is too slow.
[00:17:40.960 --> 00:17:43.560]   You can't do that in real time, probably, possibly.
[00:17:43.560 --> 00:17:45.400]   The camera is smart enough to know whether you're
[00:17:45.400 --> 00:17:49.360]   taking a portrait or a group shot, and automatically focus
[00:17:49.360 --> 00:17:51.040]   and expose for either.
[00:17:51.040 --> 00:17:53.400]   You get quicker access to your camera right from the lock
[00:17:53.400 --> 00:17:54.520]   screen.
[00:17:54.520 --> 00:17:57.920]   You can use the volume button to take a photo.
[00:17:57.920 --> 00:18:03.320]   And then you can crop, enhance, and edit your photo
[00:18:03.320 --> 00:18:04.280]   right on your iPhone.
[00:18:04.280 --> 00:18:04.680]   That's nice.
[00:18:04.680 --> 00:18:05.280]   I was fine.
[00:18:05.280 --> 00:18:08.320]   That gives you over 200 other new and improved features,
[00:18:08.320 --> 00:18:11.680]   including Notification Center, iMessage, and Reminders.
[00:18:11.680 --> 00:18:13.520]   This stuff we've seen, of course, in Stubby.
[00:18:13.520 --> 00:18:16.360]   Apple really loves the sort of features that are absolutely
[00:18:16.360 --> 00:18:18.480]   tactile, that you don't need to explain them.
[00:18:18.480 --> 00:18:20.160]   And photos are definitely in that category.
[00:18:20.160 --> 00:18:22.200]   And speaking as a guy who every month
[00:18:22.200 --> 00:18:24.000]   has to take out a couple of different new phones
[00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:24.600]   to check out.
[00:18:24.600 --> 00:18:27.760]   One of my standard tests is into the Boston Bubble Library
[00:18:27.760 --> 00:18:29.120]   and take a standard test shot.
[00:18:29.120 --> 00:18:32.400]   The amount of time that you have to wait for the camera to boot up
[00:18:32.400 --> 00:18:34.640]   and wait for it to be ready to take a picture,
[00:18:34.640 --> 00:18:36.360]   and then actually get the exposure
[00:18:36.360 --> 00:18:39.280]   is a pretty obvious failing of most cameras,
[00:18:39.280 --> 00:18:40.520]   including the iPhone 4.
[00:18:40.520 --> 00:18:44.360]   So if they deliver on just that one feature in which this
[00:18:44.360 --> 00:18:48.120]   is as good a camera as anything that you would buy from Nikon
[00:18:48.120 --> 00:18:53.440]   or Canon for $200 for $150, they already have a pretty big win.
[00:18:53.440 --> 00:18:55.000]   Let's continue on, by the way.
[00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:57.440]   I still am getting this error message access denied
[00:18:57.440 --> 00:18:59.440]   on apple.com on this service.
[00:18:59.440 --> 00:19:00.680]   So there's servers on this thing.
[00:19:00.680 --> 00:19:01.320]   Yeah, it's everywhere.
[00:19:01.320 --> 00:19:03.120]   I was trying to get into the PR section of their site
[00:19:03.120 --> 00:19:04.120]   to download some stuff.
[00:19:04.120 --> 00:19:06.080]   It took me about five minutes before I could even
[00:19:06.080 --> 00:19:07.200]   get into the PR section.
[00:19:07.200 --> 00:19:09.560]   Although this movie that we're watching
[00:19:09.560 --> 00:19:12.360]   is coming from the Apple site.
[00:19:12.360 --> 00:19:14.120]   But I was able to cash it.
[00:19:14.120 --> 00:19:15.640]   So it's up and down, obviously.
[00:19:15.640 --> 00:19:20.200]   iCloud stores your music, photos, apps, mail, contacts,
[00:19:20.200 --> 00:19:22.480]   calendars, documents, and more.
[00:19:22.480 --> 00:19:27.080]   And wirelessly pushes your content to your devices automatically.
[00:19:27.080 --> 00:19:29.880]   With iCloud, you don't have to do anything.
[00:19:29.880 --> 00:19:31.480]   It just works.
[00:19:31.480 --> 00:19:33.440]   This is where Apple, by owning the ecosystem,
[00:19:33.440 --> 00:19:34.440]   really has some advantage.
[00:19:34.440 --> 00:19:36.520]   Oh, what's inside the iPhone 4.0?
[00:19:36.520 --> 00:19:40.520]   With the new dual core A5 chip, it's so much faster.
[00:19:40.520 --> 00:19:42.360]   The new camera is incredible.
[00:19:42.360 --> 00:19:45.040]   It comes with iOS 5 and iCloud.
[00:19:45.040 --> 00:19:47.160]   And with Siri, your iPhone can do things
[00:19:47.160 --> 00:19:49.520]   no other phone has ever done.
[00:19:49.520 --> 00:19:52.880]   iPhone 4S is the most amazing iPhone.
[00:19:52.880 --> 00:19:54.880]   Yeah.
[00:19:54.880 --> 00:19:55.320]   Well--
[00:19:55.320 --> 00:19:55.520]   Really?
[00:19:55.520 --> 00:19:57.120]   Did they really have to say that?
[00:19:57.120 --> 00:19:57.620]   Yeah.
[00:19:57.620 --> 00:19:57.880]   It's marketed.
[00:19:57.880 --> 00:19:59.240]   We ended with a doubt.
[00:19:59.240 --> 00:20:01.720]   The iPhone 4S-- it's not as good as the last one, right?
[00:20:01.720 --> 00:20:03.280]   Some features may not be available in all languages
[00:20:03.280 --> 00:20:04.280]   or all areas.
[00:20:04.280 --> 00:20:07.760]   And we were expecting them to respond to Amazon's big key
[00:20:07.760 --> 00:20:10.640]   and a big statement last week that other companies
[00:20:10.640 --> 00:20:12.720]   are in the business of making things expensive.
[00:20:12.720 --> 00:20:15.200]   We're in the business of making things less expensive.
[00:20:15.200 --> 00:20:16.360]   That was what Apple could have said.
[00:20:16.360 --> 00:20:20.120]   We decided to go to a 640 by 480 display, no camera.
[00:20:20.120 --> 00:20:20.880]   We can make it less expensive.
[00:20:20.880 --> 00:20:22.480]   No support for Bluetooth.
[00:20:22.480 --> 00:20:25.520]   And now we're selling it for $18.
[00:20:25.520 --> 00:20:27.920]   I don't think that's an Apple thing to do again.
[00:20:27.920 --> 00:20:29.480]   We're talking about the big Apple announcements.
[00:20:29.480 --> 00:20:30.680]   We'll summarize those announcements
[00:20:30.680 --> 00:20:32.520]   and have more commentary for you in just a little bit.
[00:20:32.520 --> 00:20:35.160]   Andy Anacos here from the Chicago Sun Times.
[00:20:35.160 --> 00:20:37.360]   Alex Lindsey from pixelcore.com.
[00:20:37.360 --> 00:20:40.920]   The squirrel, God only knows where that's from.
[00:20:40.920 --> 00:20:44.520]   Boston's public garden, the public garden squeal.
[00:20:44.520 --> 00:20:46.040]   The store is back up, by the way.
[00:20:46.040 --> 00:20:50.320]   And yes, the iPod Classic is still available just $249.
[00:20:50.320 --> 00:20:53.920]   So I guess that 7G Classic is in fact a new iPod Classic.
[00:20:53.920 --> 00:20:56.840]   And we'll talk a little bit more about other pricing changes,
[00:20:56.840 --> 00:21:00.400]   including a free 3GS in just a moment.
[00:21:00.400 --> 00:21:02.160]   First, I'd like to tell you about the best way
[00:21:02.160 --> 00:21:06.680]   to meet online with GoToMeeting.
[00:21:06.680 --> 00:21:08.160]   With everyone on the Go these days,
[00:21:08.160 --> 00:21:11.000]   holding a impromptu meeting can be virtually impossible
[00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:13.560]   unless you're using something like GoToMeeting from Citrix.
[00:21:13.560 --> 00:21:15.360]   You can host your meeting online from your computer
[00:21:15.360 --> 00:21:18.000]   while your attendees can join from any computer.
[00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:22.080]   Even the iPad, iPhone, or Android phone.
[00:21:22.080 --> 00:21:23.800]   Just go to the App Store or the Android market
[00:21:23.800 --> 00:21:26.800]   and get that free app to start joining GoToMeeting sessions
[00:21:26.800 --> 00:21:28.240]   from anywhere.
[00:21:28.240 --> 00:21:30.080]   Your 10-year online meeting on the phone,
[00:21:30.080 --> 00:21:33.200]   isn't that awesome or the iPad?
[00:21:33.200 --> 00:21:34.000]   I just love this.
[00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:37.080]   And now with the HD faces, you also have video
[00:21:37.080 --> 00:21:38.320]   of your attendees too.
[00:21:38.320 --> 00:21:40.000]   And I'll tell you, if you're selling somebody
[00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:42.040]   or you're pitching somebody or you're training somebody,
[00:21:42.040 --> 00:21:44.680]   seeing that body language makes a huge difference
[00:21:44.680 --> 00:21:47.040]   to smile, the arms folded, the frown.
[00:21:47.040 --> 00:21:49.520]   All that can tell you a lot more than just listening
[00:21:49.520 --> 00:21:51.800]   to somebody on a conference call.
[00:21:51.800 --> 00:21:54.720]   Share your screen, share your video,
[00:21:54.720 --> 00:21:58.000]   meet on your mobile device anywhere you are.
[00:21:58.000 --> 00:21:59.640]   It's incredible.
[00:21:59.640 --> 00:22:01.520]   And the price is right, $49 a month.
[00:22:01.520 --> 00:22:03.680]   But right now, try it free for 30 days.

[00:22:19.360 --> 00:22:22.080]   or you could just use GoToMeeting and get it better yourself.

[00:22:27.560 --> 00:22:30.920]   So pricing not changed on the iPhone 4S,
[00:22:30.920 --> 00:22:33.840]   but there is a new 64 gigabyte model,
[00:22:33.840 --> 00:22:35.960]   white and black still there, that's good.
[00:22:35.960 --> 00:22:37.320]   And the biggest change, of course,
[00:22:37.320 --> 00:22:40.840]   you can now get it on Verizon, AT&T, and Sprint.
[00:22:40.840 --> 00:22:43.960]   - Sprint, evidently, the rumor is they spent a lot of money
[00:22:43.960 --> 00:22:44.960]   to make sure that they could get it on.
[00:22:44.960 --> 00:22:46.440]   - According to the Wall Street Journal,
[00:22:46.440 --> 00:22:48.840]   they spent 30 million, I'm sorry,
[00:22:48.840 --> 00:22:49.680]   - 30 million bucks.
[00:22:49.680 --> 00:22:52.320]   - They said they'd buy 30 million iPhones
[00:22:52.320 --> 00:22:53.320]   over the next four years.
[00:22:53.320 --> 00:22:55.120]   That's worth about $20 billion.
[00:22:55.120 --> 00:22:58.040]   - That's not changed about how you could have it.
[00:22:58.040 --> 00:23:01.320]   - And even Sprint itself, Dan Hess, he said,
[00:23:01.320 --> 00:23:02.840]   yeah, we're betting the farm on this one.
[00:23:02.840 --> 00:23:04.160]   We're all in on the iPhone.
[00:23:04.160 --> 00:23:05.440]   - I think that that was a,
[00:23:05.440 --> 00:23:06.440]   they couldn't survive without it.
[00:23:06.440 --> 00:23:07.280]   - They had to have it.
[00:23:07.280 --> 00:23:08.360]   - They had to have it.
[00:23:08.360 --> 00:23:10.840]   - And T-Mobile announced earlier, no, we're not getting it.
[00:23:10.840 --> 00:23:13.240]   They wanted to lower expectations.
[00:23:13.240 --> 00:23:16.440]   So T-Mobile, which is a distant force in the cell phone.
[00:23:16.440 --> 00:23:17.560]   - It doesn't matter because they're about to be,
[00:23:17.560 --> 00:23:19.040]   I mean, if the merger goes through,
[00:23:19.040 --> 00:23:21.280]   I think part of merger goes through is a big if, though.
[00:23:21.280 --> 00:23:22.120]   - Right.
[00:23:22.120 --> 00:23:25.480]   - What else about the iPhones?
[00:23:25.480 --> 00:23:27.000]   - Postcards.
[00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:28.520]   - I'm gonna start sending you postcards for me.
[00:23:28.520 --> 00:23:30.760]   - I think that's definitely a Leo Leopold.
[00:23:30.760 --> 00:23:32.720]   - It's not postcards, it's greeting cards.
[00:23:32.720 --> 00:23:33.720]   - Reading cards.
[00:23:33.720 --> 00:23:34.560]   - Even better.
[00:23:34.560 --> 00:23:37.960]   - Honestly, actually that is kind of cool
[00:23:37.960 --> 00:23:39.120]   when you think about it.
[00:23:39.120 --> 00:23:42.800]   The idea that I can be like on a trip or someplace
[00:23:42.800 --> 00:23:43.960]   seeing like, "Oh, hey, that's cool."
[00:23:43.960 --> 00:23:48.760]   There's the giant chrome bean in Chicago, it was Millennium Park.
[00:23:48.760 --> 00:23:51.720]   And remember that, "Oh, my sister's birthday is in two days."
[00:23:51.720 --> 00:23:53.160]   He just took this picture and just,
[00:23:53.160 --> 00:23:55.920]   "Okay, I'm gonna make a greeting card in the next three minutes."
[00:23:55.920 --> 00:23:58.280]   It'll be actually signed, not signed,
[00:23:58.280 --> 00:24:00.200]   but that would be a great feature.
[00:24:00.200 --> 00:24:02.520]   You can also upload a version of your signature
[00:24:02.520 --> 00:24:04.880]   that will be stamped partially embossed.
[00:24:04.880 --> 00:24:08.640]   So it looks like a pen was on a used water soluble link.
[00:24:08.640 --> 00:24:12.320]   But the ability to do something that tangible from a phone,
[00:24:12.320 --> 00:24:13.160]   it's actually kind of cool.
[00:24:13.160 --> 00:24:15.160]   I don't know if it never did a position in the keynote,
[00:24:15.160 --> 00:24:16.400]   but it was-- - I think the stock market
[00:24:16.400 --> 00:24:17.240]   might agree with you.
[00:24:17.240 --> 00:24:19.440]   Here's American Greetings stock price,
[00:24:19.440 --> 00:24:22.080]   which at 1 p.m., Eastern Time,
[00:24:22.080 --> 00:24:24.960]   which is the time of the announcement, plummeted.
[00:24:24.960 --> 00:24:26.000]   (laughs)
[00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:27.000]   - Wow. - A couple of bucks.
[00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:30.640]   Actually they're down at 1.27 right now at 7% drop.
[00:24:30.640 --> 00:24:33.400]   - Was the senior officer, was Ziggy found with a hooker
[00:24:33.400 --> 00:24:35.000]   or something? - No, I think it was
[00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:36.720]   that announcement. - Really was the announcement.
[00:24:36.720 --> 00:24:39.920]   - I believe that that is the news.
[00:24:39.920 --> 00:24:41.000]   So that's-- - Well, it's become
[00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:42.080]   a very scary company.
[00:24:42.080 --> 00:24:44.200]   - Yeah, you don't want to be in a business that they're in.
[00:24:44.200 --> 00:24:46.440]   I don't think it's gonna hurt greeting cards particularly,
[00:24:46.440 --> 00:24:48.000]   but I do think that you're right.
[00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:50.800]   If it's got a great camera, which it apparently does,
[00:24:50.800 --> 00:24:52.360]   and you take a great picture and then--
[00:24:52.360 --> 00:24:53.200]   - I definitely see using this.
[00:24:53.200 --> 00:24:56.760]   I travel enough, sending it to my parents or whatever.
[00:24:56.760 --> 00:24:59.160]   The one thing that I'd love to see that I doubt
[00:24:59.160 --> 00:25:02.640]   will happen because it's Apple is some kind of SDK
[00:25:02.640 --> 00:25:03.960]   for people to develop them.
[00:25:03.960 --> 00:25:06.920]   It'd be really interesting, for instance, for Yellowstone
[00:25:06.920 --> 00:25:08.520]   or something like that, or you're somebody
[00:25:08.520 --> 00:25:11.520]   to have their own designs that you can download.
[00:25:11.520 --> 00:25:13.440]   So when you're there, you can take a picture
[00:25:13.440 --> 00:25:15.800]   and it's got a little art design that puts you there
[00:25:15.800 --> 00:25:16.640]   and then you can send it out.
[00:25:16.640 --> 00:25:18.400]   I think we'll make it a little bit easier.
[00:25:18.400 --> 00:25:20.160]   - I'd like to see an API for Siri as well.
[00:25:20.160 --> 00:25:21.760]   It'd be really great if you're an app developer
[00:25:21.760 --> 00:25:22.600]   to hook into that.
[00:25:22.600 --> 00:25:25.360]   For instance, American Greetings could get back into the game
[00:25:25.360 --> 00:25:27.400]   by making their own app for the iPhone
[00:25:27.400 --> 00:25:30.600]   and having it say, send a greeting card to Mom
[00:25:30.600 --> 00:25:34.880]   on her birthday, talk to the phone and have it happen.
[00:25:34.880 --> 00:25:38.080]   So there's, as long as there's an API, nobody's app.
[00:25:38.080 --> 00:25:39.080]   - Well, I think it'll be really interesting
[00:25:39.080 --> 00:25:40.080]   if you take that photo and just say,
[00:25:40.080 --> 00:25:41.920]   send postcard to Mom.
[00:25:41.920 --> 00:25:42.760]   - Right.
[00:25:42.760 --> 00:25:43.840]   - Like that's, I mean, if that--
[00:25:43.840 --> 00:25:45.080]   - And it would know the address?
[00:25:45.080 --> 00:25:45.920]   That's crazy.
[00:25:45.920 --> 00:25:47.120]   - It would hook into the app.
[00:25:47.120 --> 00:25:48.520]   - Even if it worked better where you're actually
[00:25:48.520 --> 00:25:50.400]   just simply browsing pictures and you say,
[00:25:50.400 --> 00:25:52.120]   send this to Mom on the card.
[00:25:52.120 --> 00:25:53.720]   - Yeah, that would be cool.
[00:25:53.720 --> 00:25:55.760]   By the way, to be absolutely fair, Google,
[00:25:55.760 --> 00:26:00.080]   I'm sorry, Apple's a stock price also dropping $11.37
[00:26:00.080 --> 00:26:01.880]   after this announcement today.
[00:26:01.880 --> 00:26:05.240]   That's a 3% drop, not a terrible drop,
[00:26:05.240 --> 00:26:09.280]   but, and also probably not a huge vote
[00:26:09.280 --> 00:26:11.640]   from the stock market pro-work con on this.
[00:26:11.640 --> 00:26:13.120]   You expect that when there's an announcement,
[00:26:13.120 --> 00:26:15.320]   the stock price usually does go down,
[00:26:15.320 --> 00:26:19.440]   just because the rumors are what the price was going up on.
[00:26:19.440 --> 00:26:23.280]   Now there are no more rumors, there's just the fact.
[00:26:23.280 --> 00:26:28.120]   Do you think there was an iPhone 5 somewhere lurking out there?
[00:26:28.120 --> 00:26:31.360]   We saw so many designs of a slimmer,
[00:26:31.360 --> 00:26:33.760]   larger screen, higher resolution.
[00:26:33.760 --> 00:26:36.480]   Is that gonna be out in June?
[00:26:36.480 --> 00:26:38.840]   Was it planned for now, but they couldn't get it out?
[00:26:38.840 --> 00:26:40.120]   Alex?
[00:26:40.120 --> 00:26:41.880]   - I think it probably wasn't close.
[00:26:41.880 --> 00:26:43.240]   I think it's still in development.
[00:26:43.240 --> 00:26:44.080]   I don't think there's any,
[00:26:44.080 --> 00:26:45.640]   I mean, when they moved from 3G to 3GS,
[00:26:45.640 --> 00:26:48.720]   it was just, you know, they're going to release
[00:26:48.720 --> 00:26:51.680]   as many features as they have to.
[00:26:51.680 --> 00:26:53.280]   - And no more. - To move forward
[00:26:53.280 --> 00:26:54.120]   and then you know, you know. - No more.
[00:26:54.120 --> 00:26:55.640]   - And they're gonna keep on saving their powder
[00:26:55.640 --> 00:26:56.480]   for the next one.
[00:26:56.480 --> 00:26:57.920]   - And do you agree?
[00:26:57.920 --> 00:26:58.760]   - I agree completely.
[00:26:58.760 --> 00:26:59.760]   I think that they're waiting for,
[00:26:59.760 --> 00:27:02.120]   I think the iPhone 5 will be LTE,
[00:27:02.120 --> 00:27:03.880]   and they're not gonna do that until they feel as though
[00:27:03.880 --> 00:27:05.520]   they've licked a whole bunch of problems.
[00:27:05.520 --> 00:27:07.560]   The one problem that they've been mentioning
[00:27:07.560 --> 00:27:08.800]   has been battery life,
[00:27:08.800 --> 00:27:11.680]   and this device already extended the battery life
[00:27:11.680 --> 00:27:14.240]   over the iPhone 4.
[00:27:14.240 --> 00:27:16.560]   But I think it's also, they're waiting for there to be
[00:27:16.560 --> 00:27:19.960]   more than one, at least US national carrier
[00:27:19.960 --> 00:27:22.640]   that can actually handle decent 4G speeds.
[00:27:22.640 --> 00:27:25.280]   They actually had a slide that is,
[00:27:25.280 --> 00:27:28.480]   they're trying to combat Android 4G by saying,
[00:27:28.480 --> 00:27:29.920]   hey, okay, if you wanna call us,
[00:27:29.920 --> 00:27:33.040]   if you wanna call us our phone, a 4G phone,
[00:27:33.040 --> 00:27:37.760]   sure are the speeds of our enhanced 3G HSPD8.
[00:27:37.760 --> 00:27:39.400]   - Five letter words starts with a,
[00:27:39.400 --> 00:27:40.240]   (laughing)
[00:27:40.240 --> 00:27:42.200]   is what they, I always transpose at least two of those
[00:27:42.200 --> 00:27:43.240]   letters from the-- - HSPD8 plus,
[00:27:43.240 --> 00:27:44.240]   you're right. - Thank you very much.
[00:27:44.240 --> 00:27:45.640]   I admit my ignorance here.
[00:27:45.640 --> 00:27:48.720]   That's a hallmark of AT&T's network.
[00:27:48.720 --> 00:27:51.280]   They were claiming that they can get similar speeds
[00:27:51.280 --> 00:27:53.120]   on their existing enhanced 3G network
[00:27:53.120 --> 00:27:55.720]   that you can get on other networks, 4G network.
[00:27:55.720 --> 00:27:57.360]   I'm not sure that's exactly true.
[00:27:57.360 --> 00:28:01.000]   Verizon's 4G LTE is screaming fast,
[00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:02.320]   but still they have a point to make.
[00:28:02.320 --> 00:28:05.440]   I don't think it's typical of Apple form,
[00:28:05.440 --> 00:28:07.120]   not to release a new feature until they think
[00:28:07.120 --> 00:28:09.360]   they can actually make a positive impact with it,
[00:28:09.360 --> 00:28:11.280]   as opposed to just winning a war
[00:28:11.280 --> 00:28:14.080]   in a bullet chart of comparisons of phones.
[00:28:14.080 --> 00:28:16.040]   - You may, some people watching probably asking,
[00:28:16.040 --> 00:28:18.040]   "Why aren't you running down all of the features?"
[00:28:18.040 --> 00:28:19.800]   If we figure by now you've already seen
[00:28:19.800 --> 00:28:21.200]   and looked at all the spec sheets,
[00:28:21.200 --> 00:28:23.880]   or you could go back and watch our special broadcast,
[00:28:23.880 --> 00:28:26.360]   'cause we did do a live broadcast as the announcement
[00:28:26.360 --> 00:28:28.280]   was being made, and you could follow all that there.
[00:28:28.280 --> 00:28:30.120]   I will tell you probably the most important thing
[00:28:30.120 --> 00:28:33.200]   people wanna know, which is that the gold master
[00:28:33.200 --> 00:28:37.680]   for iOS 5 shipped today, so developers can start to work.
[00:28:37.680 --> 00:28:40.400]   iOS 5 will come out October 12th,
[00:28:40.400 --> 00:28:42.580]   which is about eight days from now.
[00:28:42.580 --> 00:28:46.160]   You can pre-order the iPhone 4S, not today,
[00:28:46.160 --> 00:28:49.760]   but October 7th, Friday, which is kind of interesting,
[00:28:49.760 --> 00:28:52.480]   and delivery will be one week later, October 14th.
[00:28:52.480 --> 00:28:54.160]   Presumably you could do that pre-order
[00:28:54.160 --> 00:28:56.840]   and have it mailed to your house and activate.
[00:28:56.840 --> 00:28:58.320]   You know what they didn't pay a lot of attention to?
[00:28:58.320 --> 00:29:01.240]   Something they mentioned a lot at WWDC was
[00:29:01.240 --> 00:29:04.120]   over the air activation, over the air updating,
[00:29:04.120 --> 00:29:05.400]   all of those features.
[00:29:05.400 --> 00:29:07.960]   They didn't talk a lot about iOS 5 features.
[00:29:07.960 --> 00:29:10.000]   - You know, they mentioned that in passing,
[00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:11.880]   and they really just went over the greatest hits file
[00:29:11.880 --> 00:29:13.920]   from WWDC talk.
[00:29:13.920 --> 00:29:15.080]   That was really surprising.
[00:29:15.080 --> 00:29:18.960]   They went into such detail, just recapping stuff earlier.
[00:29:18.960 --> 00:29:20.720]   That's a little like, it looks like the sort of stuff
[00:29:20.720 --> 00:29:23.080]   that they would just put up one or two slides
[00:29:23.080 --> 00:29:25.360]   with a table of features and just remind people
[00:29:25.360 --> 00:29:27.320]   of what iOS 5 rides.
[00:29:27.320 --> 00:29:29.320]   But we're going to highlight two features
[00:29:29.320 --> 00:29:31.720]   that we haven't been able to show until today,
[00:29:31.720 --> 00:29:33.320]   is how they would normally go.
[00:29:33.320 --> 00:29:35.440]   - Yeah, they did announce the rumor mill
[00:29:35.440 --> 00:29:37.400]   wasn't wrong about a new iPod Touch.
[00:29:37.400 --> 00:29:39.960]   There's now white and a black iPod Touch,
[00:29:39.960 --> 00:29:44.480]   but not a better camera, not a better screen,
[00:29:44.480 --> 00:29:46.600]   just a faster processor and better gaming.
[00:29:46.600 --> 00:29:50.040]   They were pushing that gaming on the iPod Touch as well.
[00:29:50.040 --> 00:29:51.660]   In fact, saying it was the number one
[00:29:51.660 --> 00:29:54.120]   selling portable gaming platform out there.
[00:29:55.220 --> 00:29:58.860]   - $199 is starting price on the iPod Touch.
[00:29:58.860 --> 00:30:01.580]   - And I think that was one of the quiet little submarine
[00:30:01.580 --> 00:30:03.700]   things they slipped into the talk,
[00:30:03.700 --> 00:30:05.660]   talking about how iOS 5 on the,
[00:30:05.660 --> 00:30:06.940]   at least on the 4S supports,
[00:30:06.940 --> 00:30:09.300]   AirPlay mirroring of displays.
[00:30:09.300 --> 00:30:12.220]   So essentially, so given that your already developers
[00:30:12.220 --> 00:30:14.060]   already developing games for the iPhone 4
[00:30:14.060 --> 00:30:16.540]   and the iPod Touch for this retina,
[00:30:16.540 --> 00:30:18.580]   really high level of resolution display,
[00:30:18.580 --> 00:30:21.060]   essentially what you're holding in your hands right now
[00:30:21.060 --> 00:30:23.500]   is a console game if you've got an Apple TV,
[00:30:23.500 --> 00:30:27.340]   because you've got we style controls,
[00:30:27.340 --> 00:30:28.900]   and now you can basically do all this
[00:30:28.900 --> 00:30:30.780]   while watching over there for that.
[00:30:30.780 --> 00:30:33.820]   So they made no secret of the fact that now
[00:30:33.820 --> 00:30:36.420]   they're calling it actively the most popular
[00:30:36.420 --> 00:30:38.820]   mobile gaming platform on the planet.
[00:30:38.820 --> 00:30:41.260]   So you know that that's where they're hoping
[00:30:41.260 --> 00:30:43.780]   to control that part of the dialogue as well.
[00:30:43.780 --> 00:30:46.140]   - Seems to me they used that tagline last time as well.
[00:30:46.140 --> 00:30:48.380]   I think they knew it was a gaming device.
[00:30:48.380 --> 00:30:50.780]   - I think that when you talk about gaming devices,
[00:30:50.780 --> 00:30:53.060]   I'm just still surprised they haven't taken the Apple TV
[00:30:53.060 --> 00:30:55.180]   to and just opened up the iOS.
[00:30:55.180 --> 00:30:56.540]   You know like you know and made it more yummy.
[00:30:56.540 --> 00:30:57.740]   - Did you give up on this TV crap?
[00:30:57.740 --> 00:30:59.860]   You know you thought there was gonna be a big screen TV
[00:30:59.860 --> 00:31:00.700]   that did happen?
[00:31:00.700 --> 00:31:01.980]   - I think that there's something,
[00:31:01.980 --> 00:31:03.700]   I'm a, you know,
[00:31:03.700 --> 00:31:05.620]   - He didn't mention Apple TV, the hobby.
[00:31:05.620 --> 00:31:07.020]   He didn't mention any of that stuff.
[00:31:07.020 --> 00:31:08.460]   He didn't even mention Steve Jobs.
[00:31:08.460 --> 00:31:13.300]   In fact, Steve Jobs was a great invisible at this.
[00:31:13.300 --> 00:31:15.060]   Some people thought maybe Steve would show up
[00:31:15.060 --> 00:31:16.540]   or they would at least say, you know,
[00:31:16.540 --> 00:31:20.740]   Steve's not here but he wishes you the best, nothing.
[00:31:20.740 --> 00:31:23.620]   - This is, the Steve Jobs era is over at Apple.
[00:31:23.620 --> 00:31:26.020]   - And I wonder if our impatience specifically
[00:31:26.020 --> 00:31:27.980]   with this keynote was that this,
[00:31:27.980 --> 00:31:29.780]   there's no distortion field.
[00:31:29.780 --> 00:31:32.340]   We suddenly realized that it's just a really long presentation.
[00:31:32.340 --> 00:31:34.020]   - That was what Steve's mastery was at.
[00:31:34.020 --> 00:31:37.660]   Although Steve has given even less interesting keynotes.
[00:31:37.660 --> 00:31:38.500]   I mean,
[00:31:38.500 --> 00:31:41.420]   - But we've sat through a few at that very town hall.
[00:31:41.420 --> 00:31:45.420]   - Remember, I remember the launch of the original iPhone
[00:31:45.420 --> 00:31:46.300]   where just like this,
[00:31:46.300 --> 00:31:49.020]   everybody knew that the meat was going to be this new device
[00:31:49.020 --> 00:31:50.380]   that was going to be a phone.
[00:31:50.380 --> 00:31:52.780]   And it seemed as though it took an hour and 30 minutes
[00:31:52.780 --> 00:31:54.860]   just to get to the 25 minute presentation
[00:31:54.860 --> 00:31:56.740]   where they finally took the wraps off the thing.
[00:31:56.740 --> 00:31:59.500]   So maybe we shouldn't be quite so Joan River's-ish
[00:31:59.500 --> 00:32:00.900]   about the show disaster. - Oh, come on.
[00:32:00.900 --> 00:32:02.020]   - That's pretty much fun.
[00:32:02.020 --> 00:32:03.260]   (laughing)
[00:32:03.260 --> 00:32:06.900]   - iPod Nano is updated with a new user interface.
[00:32:06.900 --> 00:32:09.180]   It has a pedometer built into it.
[00:32:09.180 --> 00:32:11.900]   So you don't need a dongle anymore to use Nike Plus.
[00:32:11.900 --> 00:32:13.940]   And they kind of, I thought this was interesting.
[00:32:13.940 --> 00:32:16.340]   I acknowledge that many people are starting to use the Nano
[00:32:16.340 --> 00:32:19.020]   as wrist watches, which is ridiculous.
[00:32:19.020 --> 00:32:20.820]   People wear less fewer wrist watches,
[00:32:20.820 --> 00:32:22.500]   but now they wear the Nano.
[00:32:22.500 --> 00:32:26.180]   - Yeah, but it makes it more usable.
[00:32:26.180 --> 00:32:27.940]   Before it only had really one face
[00:32:27.940 --> 00:32:30.900]   and you can have it black or white as a background.
[00:32:30.900 --> 00:32:32.220]   So now they're really making it more
[00:32:32.220 --> 00:32:33.540]   of an accessory sort of thing.
[00:32:33.540 --> 00:32:34.620]   I thought it was really cool too,
[00:32:34.620 --> 00:32:36.980]   that one of the, I think it was 14 new faces
[00:32:36.980 --> 00:32:38.940]   is a Mickey Mouse watch. - I love that.
[00:32:38.940 --> 00:32:41.380]   - So it kind of helps when like, you know,
[00:32:41.380 --> 00:32:44.220]   someone higher up and Apple has some pull at Disney.
[00:32:44.220 --> 00:32:46.460]   - Yeah, yeah it does, doesn't it?
[00:32:46.460 --> 00:32:48.980]   - Multi-touch now too.
[00:32:48.980 --> 00:32:49.940]   I was always multi-touch.
[00:32:49.940 --> 00:32:51.780]   That's what I thought, but it's saying multi-touch
[00:32:51.780 --> 00:32:52.940]   as if this is a new feature.
[00:32:52.940 --> 00:32:54.220]   So. - Multi-touch and that,
[00:32:54.220 --> 00:32:56.580]   that's how you would rotate this play.
[00:32:56.580 --> 00:32:57.420]   - It turned it, that's right.
[00:32:57.420 --> 00:32:59.500]   - You have to do two fingers, that's right.
[00:32:59.500 --> 00:33:03.340]   But yeah, I gotta say that that's a good idea.
[00:33:03.340 --> 00:33:05.860]   Now instead of having a two by two grid of tiny,
[00:33:05.860 --> 00:33:08.700]   tiny little app icons, now you basically scroll left
[00:33:08.700 --> 00:33:11.500]   and right through existing features.
[00:33:11.500 --> 00:33:14.460]   - Yeah, the Nano though is actually kind of beloved, I think.
[00:33:14.460 --> 00:33:16.580]   Will there be an update to existing NANOs
[00:33:16.580 --> 00:33:17.780]   to give it those watch faces?
[00:33:17.780 --> 00:33:19.220]   Or do you have to buy a new one?
[00:33:19.220 --> 00:33:21.900]   - I don't know. - Good guess.
[00:33:21.900 --> 00:33:23.660]   - I don't know.
[00:33:23.660 --> 00:33:24.940]   Let me see if I can find a,
[00:33:24.940 --> 00:33:26.940]   I'm trying to find the watch faces.
[00:33:26.940 --> 00:33:29.260]   'Cause I'd love to see these.
[00:33:29.260 --> 00:33:30.460]   - It's a good work, and it really is.
[00:33:30.460 --> 00:33:33.820]   I mean, that is the great workout little device.
[00:33:33.820 --> 00:33:34.900]   - Yeah, we don't wanna be kidding around.
[00:33:34.900 --> 00:33:36.820]   - Here's all the clock faces.
[00:33:36.820 --> 00:33:39.980]   So they've always had the white and the black clocks.
[00:33:39.980 --> 00:33:44.980]   Now you've got a other white and black clock faces.
[00:33:44.980 --> 00:33:46.860]   It's not loading, there's green.
[00:33:46.860 --> 00:33:48.460]   - Gotta give it a second.
[00:33:48.460 --> 00:33:49.380]   - I'm impatient.
[00:33:49.380 --> 00:33:50.940]   - It's going to space.
[00:33:50.940 --> 00:33:54.300]   - The server is in bad shape, the Apple server right here.
[00:33:54.300 --> 00:33:56.820]   - Yeah, everyone's leaving Siri and the iPhone 4S alone.
[00:33:56.820 --> 00:33:59.780]   They rarely all wanna see this one page of watch faces.
[00:33:59.780 --> 00:34:01.220]   - Apparently.
[00:34:01.220 --> 00:34:04.140]   - No, actually Siri is also suffering server issues.
[00:34:04.140 --> 00:34:06.940]   So I see digital faces, I see analog faces,
[00:34:06.940 --> 00:34:11.940]   I see multi-dial faces, day-date features, Mickey Mouse.
[00:34:11.940 --> 00:34:14.060]   Looks like a Kermit the Frog.
[00:34:14.060 --> 00:34:15.260]   And who is that?
[00:34:15.260 --> 00:34:16.460]   Is that Elmo down here?
[00:34:16.460 --> 00:34:17.540]   What is this?
[00:34:17.540 --> 00:34:18.380]   What is that down there?
[00:34:18.380 --> 00:34:19.220]   That looks like Elmo.
[00:34:19.220 --> 00:34:20.140]   - Yeah, that's Elmo.
[00:34:20.140 --> 00:34:22.620]   - So they also apparently did a deal with Henson.
[00:34:22.620 --> 00:34:26.220]   - Well, Henson, well, I was gonna say,
[00:34:26.220 --> 00:34:28.580]   I think Henson belongs to Disney now.
[00:34:28.580 --> 00:34:29.900]   - Ah, that's why.
[00:34:29.900 --> 00:34:30.740]   - You're right, I think you're right.
[00:34:30.740 --> 00:34:32.020]   - I wonder if they bought the character's back
[00:34:32.020 --> 00:34:32.860]   or something, yeah.
[00:34:32.860 --> 00:34:34.540]   - Anyway, that's not Elmo, that's Animal.
[00:34:34.540 --> 00:34:38.300]   We're being told pardon me, apologies.
[00:34:38.300 --> 00:34:39.140]   It is a vlog.
[00:34:39.140 --> 00:34:42.100]   - For the first time, you've got me thinking that
[00:34:42.100 --> 00:34:44.740]   Elmo grows up, gets into rock music and drugs
[00:34:44.740 --> 00:34:45.820]   and becomes animal.
[00:34:45.820 --> 00:34:47.820]   (laughing)
[00:34:47.820 --> 00:34:50.420]   - It's the same voice for crying out loud.
[00:34:50.420 --> 00:34:52.300]   - You need to get Elmo into a scared, straight program.
[00:34:52.300 --> 00:34:53.140]   Right now.
[00:34:53.140 --> 00:34:56.420]   - Animal is interesting, animal's a drummer, isn't he?
[00:34:56.420 --> 00:34:58.820]   On the rock band, wow.
[00:34:58.820 --> 00:35:01.420]   That animal has a little date feature,
[00:35:01.420 --> 00:35:05.060]   and they even make it look like a physical date dial.
[00:35:05.060 --> 00:35:06.300]   That's hysterical.
[00:35:06.300 --> 00:35:10.220]   There's Kermit, here's Minnie, here's Mickey.
[00:35:10.220 --> 00:35:13.020]   Now this is, this is, you know what?
[00:35:13.020 --> 00:35:15.100]   It makes me wanna buy a watch band.
[00:35:15.100 --> 00:35:16.900]   - And you know what, I would actually go to the App Store
[00:35:16.900 --> 00:35:18.540]   to buy different watch faces.
[00:35:18.540 --> 00:35:20.580]   If people came up with really cool different faces,
[00:35:20.580 --> 00:35:22.100]   if there was a buck 99,
[00:35:22.100 --> 00:35:26.220]   you get an absolutely inscrutable binary clock face.
[00:35:26.220 --> 00:35:28.500]   That would be a buck 99 I would spend.
[00:35:28.500 --> 00:35:29.820]   'Cause you just liked the torture people.
[00:35:29.820 --> 00:35:31.340]   Actually, you had a good suggestion.
[00:35:31.340 --> 00:35:33.100]   A nixie clock face.
[00:35:33.100 --> 00:35:35.380]   - So someone on Twitter said that they should do a version
[00:35:35.380 --> 00:35:39.060]   of like Steve Wozniak's nixie tube watch.
[00:35:39.060 --> 00:35:40.740]   And I said, well, we have to have a housing for this
[00:35:40.740 --> 00:35:42.820]   about the size of a tuna can just to make sure
[00:35:42.820 --> 00:35:43.980]   to complete the effect.
[00:35:43.980 --> 00:35:48.940]   - Let's see, the iPad classic is still alive.
[00:35:48.940 --> 00:35:51.300]   You can breathe easy, thank goodness.
[00:35:51.300 --> 00:35:53.620]   There was some concern because that's the only one
[00:35:53.620 --> 00:35:56.020]   that holds 160 gigabytes of music.
[00:35:56.020 --> 00:35:58.500]   And I know Alex, you filled yours up.
[00:35:58.500 --> 00:36:00.220]   - Well, and I think that it's,
[00:36:00.220 --> 00:36:02.100]   well, it's got a lot of video and audio to fill it up.
[00:36:02.100 --> 00:36:05.220]   But it's one of those things that I think that
[00:36:05.220 --> 00:36:07.180]   there are a couple years away from the cloud
[00:36:07.180 --> 00:36:08.500]   really sinking and people going,
[00:36:08.500 --> 00:36:10.140]   well, I don't really need storage anymore.
[00:36:10.140 --> 00:36:11.860]   You know, they got to prove that the iCloud's
[00:36:11.860 --> 00:36:12.700]   actually gonna work.
[00:36:12.700 --> 00:36:14.540]   They got to get people actually converted over.
[00:36:14.540 --> 00:36:16.300]   - And you got to figure that this downtime
[00:36:16.300 --> 00:36:18.060]   on the Apple site is--
[00:36:18.060 --> 00:36:18.900]   - Does not make you feel better.
[00:36:18.900 --> 00:36:22.180]   - Not an encouraging thing for the Apple site now
[00:36:22.180 --> 00:36:23.020]   run on iCloud.
[00:36:23.020 --> 00:36:25.700]   - Wow, wow.
[00:36:25.700 --> 00:36:30.100]   I mean, I'm not, look, our site was down too, but it's Apple.
[00:36:30.100 --> 00:36:30.940]   We're just quit.
[00:36:30.940 --> 00:36:35.220]   Somebody's saying that there is a new AppleCare program.
[00:36:35.220 --> 00:36:36.060]   And I'm trying to find this.
[00:36:36.060 --> 00:36:39.140]   Yeah, AppleCare Plus, one year of hardware,
[00:36:39.140 --> 00:36:42.660]   pair coverage, 90 days of telephone tech support.
[00:36:42.660 --> 00:36:45.180]   So, AppleCare Plus for the iPhone extends its coverage
[00:36:45.180 --> 00:36:48.660]   to two years and adds accidental damage protection.
[00:36:48.660 --> 00:36:51.700]   So they do have a new AppleCare program for the iPhone.
[00:36:51.700 --> 00:36:54.300]   It is $99, but I have to say,
[00:36:54.300 --> 00:36:57.340]   I've gone through a number of glass iPhones.
[00:36:57.340 --> 00:36:58.820]   Well, not me, my kids.
[00:36:59.780 --> 00:37:02.580]   The new AppleCare Plus extends repair coverage
[00:37:02.580 --> 00:37:04.300]   and technical support for two years
[00:37:04.300 --> 00:37:05.980]   from the original purchase date of your iPhone.
[00:37:05.980 --> 00:37:09.420]   Adds coverage for up to two incidents of accidental damage
[00:37:09.420 --> 00:37:13.260]   due to handling each subject to a $49 service fee.
[00:37:13.260 --> 00:37:16.580]   So you pay a hundred bucks, you could break your phone twice,
[00:37:16.580 --> 00:37:18.540]   50 bucks each time to get it fixed.
[00:37:18.540 --> 00:37:19.460]   Is that worth it?
[00:37:19.460 --> 00:37:20.700]   - I've killed two.
[00:37:20.700 --> 00:37:21.540]   - You would, that would--
[00:37:21.540 --> 00:37:22.540]   - It's 200 bucks total.
[00:37:22.540 --> 00:37:24.140]   - Yeah, I mean, I would have paid 200 dollars.
[00:37:24.140 --> 00:37:25.580]   - I would have paid, yeah.
[00:37:25.580 --> 00:37:29.820]   - Well, they offer placement for 200 bucks, right?
[00:37:29.820 --> 00:37:30.780]   Is that not correct?
[00:37:30.780 --> 00:37:32.620]   - I think it's $199, yeah.
[00:37:32.620 --> 00:37:35.740]   The back glass only costs like 29 bucks to replace.
[00:37:35.740 --> 00:37:36.740]   - Right, right.
[00:37:36.740 --> 00:37:38.740]   - Once it's total, it's $199.
[00:37:38.740 --> 00:37:40.260]   Also, but it's interesting though,
[00:37:40.260 --> 00:37:43.500]   because remember that Apple has their super top secret,
[00:37:43.500 --> 00:37:46.980]   we're awesome policy, where it's usually worthwhile
[00:37:46.980 --> 00:37:48.780]   to come in, be honest about what happened,
[00:37:48.780 --> 00:37:50.300]   and see if they'll just swap it out for you.
[00:37:50.300 --> 00:37:51.660]   They might actually do that.
[00:37:51.660 --> 00:37:53.380]   I wonder if the availability of this
[00:37:53.380 --> 00:37:56.300]   as an actual price in Apple care,
[00:37:56.300 --> 00:37:58.460]   saying you can buy the we're awesome policy
[00:37:58.460 --> 00:38:00.660]   for $99.
[00:38:00.660 --> 00:38:03.140]   I wonder if that will cause individual stores
[00:38:03.140 --> 00:38:05.220]   to be a little bit more stingy about
[00:38:05.220 --> 00:38:06.980]   when they'll swap out for broken mortgage.
[00:38:06.980 --> 00:38:11.220]   - Yeah, we read that email from an Apple employee,
[00:38:11.220 --> 00:38:12.940]   retail employee last week,
[00:38:12.940 --> 00:38:14.620]   who explained that if you're nice,
[00:38:14.620 --> 00:38:15.900]   they have a lot of leeway.
[00:38:15.900 --> 00:38:20.140]   There's a lot that they can do over and above
[00:38:20.140 --> 00:38:21.860]   what they're required to do.
[00:38:23.100 --> 00:38:24.620]   - I just like the fact that if I,
[00:38:24.620 --> 00:38:26.660]   one of them has been, it turns out the iPhone
[00:38:26.660 --> 00:38:28.820]   does not do well in the warm cycle.
[00:38:28.820 --> 00:38:29.660]   (laughing)
[00:38:29.660 --> 00:38:30.820]   - In case you're wondering, what kind of thing?
[00:38:30.820 --> 00:38:32.420]   - What brand of fabric software did you use?
[00:38:32.420 --> 00:38:33.260]   - Yeah, exactly.
[00:38:33.260 --> 00:38:34.340]   Well, you know, yeah.
[00:38:34.340 --> 00:38:35.180]   - There is--
[00:38:35.180 --> 00:38:36.020]   - They recommend downing.
[00:38:36.020 --> 00:38:38.180]   - I've actually had one, I've had one die
[00:38:38.180 --> 00:38:40.100]   and one survive, those things.
[00:38:40.100 --> 00:38:40.940]   Not that I've--
[00:38:40.940 --> 00:38:42.780]   - An iPhone survived the wash?
[00:38:42.780 --> 00:38:43.620]   - Three days of rice.
[00:38:43.620 --> 00:38:44.540]   - That's very impressive.
[00:38:44.540 --> 00:38:45.380]   - Three days of rice.
[00:38:45.380 --> 00:38:46.220]   - Oh, rice, that's the key.
[00:38:46.220 --> 00:38:47.220]   Put it in a box with rice.
[00:38:47.220 --> 00:38:48.900]   - I think actually the only reason I think it survived
[00:38:48.900 --> 00:38:50.020]   though was because the battery--
[00:38:50.020 --> 00:38:51.140]   - By the way, it's already dead.
[00:38:51.140 --> 00:38:52.500]   - The rice should be uncooked.
[00:38:52.500 --> 00:38:53.700]   - Yes, uncooked rice.
[00:38:53.700 --> 00:38:54.860]   You can't put it in the cooked rice.
[00:38:54.860 --> 00:38:55.700]   You have to--
[00:38:55.700 --> 00:38:56.860]   - I'll just write it.
[00:38:56.860 --> 00:38:58.620]   - You also want it to be in the Ziploc bag,
[00:38:58.620 --> 00:39:01.060]   so it'll pull moisture only from the phone
[00:39:01.060 --> 00:39:01.900]   and not from the environment.
[00:39:01.900 --> 00:39:02.900]   - And I actually have a theory that if you do it
[00:39:02.900 --> 00:39:04.660]   while the battery is working,
[00:39:04.660 --> 00:39:07.060]   while the battery's good, it'll kill the phone.
[00:39:07.060 --> 00:39:09.500]   And it's only if the battery is completely dead.
[00:39:09.500 --> 00:39:10.500]   - You don't want to be juiced.
[00:39:10.500 --> 00:39:12.500]   - The worst thing you could do, of course, is apply voltage.
[00:39:12.500 --> 00:39:14.460]   And if you drop a phone that has a removable battery,
[00:39:14.460 --> 00:39:16.140]   you pop the battery right away.
[00:39:16.140 --> 00:39:16.980]   - Yeah.
[00:39:16.980 --> 00:39:17.820]   - It saves that.
[00:39:17.820 --> 00:39:18.980]   There's also a corrosion issue.
[00:39:18.980 --> 00:39:22.020]   There's a place up the road of peace, iPhone repair place.
[00:39:22.020 --> 00:39:23.820]   And I talked to them for a couple of hours
[00:39:23.820 --> 00:39:26.020]   while they repaired several of my iPhones.
[00:39:26.020 --> 00:39:26.860]   (laughing)
[00:39:26.860 --> 00:39:29.420]   But the various damages and things that would happen.
[00:39:29.420 --> 00:39:31.860]   - But if it isn't, butter fingers McGee.
[00:39:31.860 --> 00:39:32.700]   - Hey, a bag.
[00:39:32.700 --> 00:39:34.220]   (laughing)
[00:39:34.220 --> 00:39:36.580]   - But no, these iPhones, AppleCare Plus,
[00:39:36.580 --> 00:39:37.540]   I think for a lot of people,
[00:39:37.540 --> 00:39:38.940]   that's actually pretty attractive.
[00:39:38.940 --> 00:39:40.300]   That's pretty desirable.
[00:39:40.300 --> 00:39:42.460]   What else, anything else to say?
[00:39:42.460 --> 00:39:44.260]   We've got iCloud.
[00:39:44.260 --> 00:39:48.180]   You know, I think that what iCloud ends up being
[00:39:48.180 --> 00:39:51.420]   is unclear until we actually start using it.
[00:39:51.420 --> 00:39:54.580]   So I don't understand what it's going to do.
[00:39:54.580 --> 00:39:55.900]   - It's hard to understand it also.
[00:39:55.900 --> 00:39:59.020]   It's one of those features that it really has to work
[00:39:59.020 --> 00:39:59.860]   all the time.
[00:39:59.860 --> 00:40:04.100]   The first time that I've started a document on my iPhone,
[00:40:04.100 --> 00:40:05.380]   while waiting in line somewhere,
[00:40:05.380 --> 00:40:07.820]   and then come home expecting it to be on my desktop.
[00:40:07.820 --> 00:40:10.180]   And it's not on my desktop and it's not on my iPhone either.
[00:40:10.180 --> 00:40:12.500]   That would be the time that I stopped trusting iCloud
[00:40:12.500 --> 00:40:14.580]   for anything for a month and a half or two months.
[00:40:14.580 --> 00:40:16.180]   So it's going to be interesting.
[00:40:16.180 --> 00:40:17.660]   Also, they haven't really mapped out yet,
[00:40:17.660 --> 00:40:19.340]   the full parameters of what it does.
[00:40:19.340 --> 00:40:21.060]   A lot of people are making a big deal out of the fact
[00:40:21.060 --> 00:40:25.820]   that in the demo, they said sort of under his breath
[00:40:25.820 --> 00:40:30.820]   about streaming from iCloud, from the iTunes library.
[00:40:30.820 --> 00:40:31.820]   - But we don't know.
[00:40:31.820 --> 00:40:32.660]   - Yeah.
[00:40:32.660 --> 00:40:34.060]   - And they haven't actually announced,
[00:40:34.060 --> 00:40:35.060]   I don't believe they've announced this
[00:40:35.060 --> 00:40:36.220]   as streaming service yet,
[00:40:36.220 --> 00:40:38.620]   but that just goes to show that there's so much
[00:40:38.620 --> 00:40:40.340]   that even developers don't really know
[00:40:40.340 --> 00:40:42.140]   about what iCloud is supposed to do.
[00:40:42.140 --> 00:40:46.300]   We remember that Siri and this voice navigation
[00:40:46.300 --> 00:40:50.020]   is probably the landmark feature of the iPhone 4S.
[00:40:50.020 --> 00:40:50.940]   It's probably the reason,
[00:40:50.940 --> 00:40:53.700]   it would be not incorrect to assume that,
[00:40:53.700 --> 00:40:55.780]   not irrational to assume that that's the reason
[00:40:55.780 --> 00:40:57.820]   why they put such a beefy processor in it,
[00:40:57.820 --> 00:41:00.140]   so they can do all this voice command.
[00:41:00.140 --> 00:41:03.140]   And yet, Apple said not a word about this.
[00:41:03.140 --> 00:41:04.740]   There wasn't even a hint about this
[00:41:04.740 --> 00:41:07.620]   and any of the developer builds until today's gold master.
[00:41:07.620 --> 00:41:09.580]   There was a button that if you were to tear apart
[00:41:09.580 --> 00:41:10.700]   when the developer builds,
[00:41:10.700 --> 00:41:13.340]   you would see that somewhere within the user interface elements,
[00:41:13.340 --> 00:41:16.380]   there is a version of this keyboard that has a microphone on it,
[00:41:16.380 --> 00:41:18.300]   but otherwise Apple hadn't said anything.
[00:41:18.300 --> 00:41:19.700]   Isn't that kind of unusual?
[00:41:19.700 --> 00:41:22.860]   - Why are they pointing out,
[00:41:22.860 --> 00:41:24.420]   the chatroom's pointing out that I've thrown,
[00:41:24.420 --> 00:41:28.940]   that Apple is now offering a USB micro adapter.
[00:41:28.940 --> 00:41:30.940]   - That's probably for European audiences,
[00:41:30.940 --> 00:41:32.740]   where they have these required.
[00:41:32.740 --> 00:41:36.100]   - They have to have one charger for everything,
[00:41:36.100 --> 00:41:37.140]   so that's how they get around that.
[00:41:37.140 --> 00:41:37.980]   - Right.
[00:41:38.820 --> 00:41:40.900]   Lots of new features in the camera.
[00:41:40.900 --> 00:41:42.420]   We mentioned image stabilization,
[00:41:42.420 --> 00:41:45.020]   there's face recognition built under the camera.
[00:41:45.020 --> 00:41:47.100]   I mean, I think this camera's gonna be pretty impressive.
[00:41:47.100 --> 00:41:48.340]   - I think the stabilization is what people
[00:41:48.340 --> 00:41:49.420]   are gonna notice the most.
[00:41:49.420 --> 00:41:50.260]   - That and the resolution,
[00:41:50.260 --> 00:41:52.340]   but I mean, I think the stabilization's gonna be very important.
[00:41:52.340 --> 00:41:53.180]   - Yeah.
[00:41:53.180 --> 00:41:54.620]   - Not only that, but just the simple fact
[00:41:54.620 --> 00:41:56.460]   that it can get great pictures from places
[00:41:56.460 --> 00:41:59.460]   that can't get great pictures from otherwise.
[00:41:59.460 --> 00:42:01.020]   One of those demo pictures I was telling you about
[00:42:01.020 --> 00:42:04.020]   is inside this beautiful study hall
[00:42:04.020 --> 00:42:05.540]   at the Boston Public Library.
[00:42:05.540 --> 00:42:07.180]   And unfortunately, it wasn't until I,
[00:42:07.180 --> 00:42:10.260]   so I took three pictures, one with like a regular camera,
[00:42:10.260 --> 00:42:11.300]   one with the iPhone 4,
[00:42:11.300 --> 00:42:13.260]   and one with I think was the Droid Bionic.
[00:42:13.260 --> 00:42:15.020]   And it wasn't until I got home that I realized
[00:42:15.020 --> 00:42:17.780]   that the regular camera took a great picture,
[00:42:17.780 --> 00:42:19.540]   the iPhone 4 took a great picture.
[00:42:19.540 --> 00:42:22.620]   Unfortunately, the Bionic's camera was so,
[00:42:22.620 --> 00:42:25.260]   didn't have the sort of enough light sensitivity
[00:42:25.260 --> 00:42:27.980]   that it could actually take a clear, unbluried photo.
[00:42:27.980 --> 00:42:29.340]   It kept the shutter open for so long
[00:42:29.340 --> 00:42:31.340]   that it was actually a useless photo.
[00:42:31.340 --> 00:42:34.060]   So the fact that they've made as good an improvement,
[00:42:34.060 --> 00:42:36.860]   the iPhone 4 already was over other cameras.
[00:42:36.860 --> 00:42:38.140]   Now they've made the sensor,
[00:42:38.140 --> 00:42:41.260]   whether they say 72% more light sensitive.
[00:42:41.260 --> 00:42:43.780]   And now the camera has, it used to be an F-28,
[00:42:43.780 --> 00:42:45.780]   now it's an F-24.
[00:42:45.780 --> 00:42:48.060]   That's, I really can't wait to get ahold of this camera
[00:42:48.060 --> 00:42:49.140]   and start rocking and rolling with it.
[00:42:49.140 --> 00:42:50.580]   - Yeah, and I'm nearly faster with light,
[00:42:50.580 --> 00:42:51.860]   but also faster shooting.
[00:42:51.860 --> 00:42:54.780]   They showed a graph that showed out quickly.
[00:42:54.780 --> 00:42:57.180]   Not only is it ready to shoot just in a second or two,
[00:42:57.180 --> 00:43:00.260]   but that it's able to continue to shoot
[00:43:00.260 --> 00:43:01.980]   at every half second another image.
[00:43:01.980 --> 00:43:04.380]   And that's the fastest, as far as I know,
[00:43:04.380 --> 00:43:05.820]   the fastest camera phone out there.
[00:43:05.820 --> 00:43:08.780]   - If I can go from this thing in my pocket
[00:43:08.780 --> 00:43:11.140]   to taking a picture in exactly the same amount of time
[00:43:11.140 --> 00:43:13.020]   it takes to go from a regular camera
[00:43:13.020 --> 00:43:15.220]   taken out of my pocket to taking a picture,
[00:43:15.220 --> 00:43:18.900]   that would, I think, be unprecedented in a camera phone.
[00:43:18.900 --> 00:43:25.820]   - The new iPhones are from, start at 199, 299 for 32 gig,
[00:43:25.820 --> 00:43:28.420]   64 gigs, 399.
[00:43:28.420 --> 00:43:30.540]   They're also offer though, and this is interesting.
[00:43:30.540 --> 00:43:34.260]   They'll still sell the 3GS for $0
[00:43:34.260 --> 00:43:39.100]   with two year contract and $50 for the old iPhone 4.
[00:43:39.100 --> 00:43:40.820]   So there really will be three iPhone.
[00:43:40.820 --> 00:43:41.980]   - 50 or $99.
[00:43:41.980 --> 00:43:42.980]   - I'm sorry, $99.
[00:43:42.980 --> 00:43:44.500]   - 99 dollars.
[00:43:44.500 --> 00:43:45.620]   - So there will be three iPhones.
[00:43:45.620 --> 00:43:48.020]   And you know, the truth is $99 for an iPhone 4,
[00:43:48.020 --> 00:43:51.900]   which is not so much less than what they're selling right now
[00:43:51.900 --> 00:43:52.740]   is a good value.
[00:43:52.740 --> 00:43:55.420]   - Yeah, and also 99 bucks, that's not a piece of crap phone.
[00:43:55.420 --> 00:43:57.580]   That is a really damn sturdy phone.
[00:43:57.580 --> 00:44:00.580]   And now that there's a free with contract phone,
[00:44:00.580 --> 00:44:02.900]   that's a pretty big stick to wave
[00:44:02.900 --> 00:44:04.980]   in front of other manufacturers right now.
[00:44:04.980 --> 00:44:07.500]   - And lots of, you can imagine lots of high school kids
[00:44:07.500 --> 00:44:11.140]   and college students, you know, being able to just latch that
[00:44:11.140 --> 00:44:12.620]   on, you know, into the family plan.
[00:44:12.620 --> 00:44:15.300]   It's not very expensive if you look at it that way.
[00:44:15.300 --> 00:44:17.580]   - But that's one big question that's gonna have to be solved
[00:44:17.580 --> 00:44:20.740]   next week, is how many of these features do you lose
[00:44:20.740 --> 00:44:22.500]   when you go from 4S to a 4?
[00:44:22.500 --> 00:44:24.860]   How many more of these iOS 5 features do you lose
[00:44:24.860 --> 00:44:26.980]   when you go from a 4 to a 3GS now?
[00:44:26.980 --> 00:44:28.460]   - They didn't say, but we do think Siri
[00:44:28.460 --> 00:44:30.020]   will only work on a 4S, right?
[00:44:30.020 --> 00:44:31.340]   The iOS system.
[00:44:31.340 --> 00:44:32.180]   - Yeah.
[00:44:32.180 --> 00:44:34.340]   - But we don't know.
[00:44:34.340 --> 00:44:39.020]   Again, no Facebook news, no iPad announcement for Facebook.
[00:44:39.020 --> 00:44:42.020]   No news about an NFC chip in the iPhone.
[00:44:42.020 --> 00:44:45.580]   No Apple, HDTV, I'm sorry.
[00:44:45.580 --> 00:44:47.820]   - We didn't actually get to see the event.
[00:44:47.820 --> 00:44:49.100]   I mean, obviously they're talking a lot about
[00:44:49.100 --> 00:44:50.980]   Twitter integration, but they haven't really talked about
[00:44:50.980 --> 00:44:52.980]   the depth of Twitter integration.
[00:44:52.980 --> 00:44:55.980]   - Chief McDonald, who is here during our announcement
[00:44:55.980 --> 00:44:57.620]   from a smile on my Mac software,
[00:44:57.620 --> 00:45:00.220]   we're saying they call him some smile software now,
[00:45:00.220 --> 00:45:02.580]   but did mention that the Twitter integration is deep
[00:45:02.580 --> 00:45:06.620]   and available in an API, so expect a lot of Twitter integration.
[00:45:06.620 --> 00:45:08.820]   It feels, maybe I'm wrong, but it feels a little bit
[00:45:08.820 --> 00:45:11.580]   behind the times to promote Twitter when Facebook
[00:45:11.580 --> 00:45:14.540]   and Google+ seem to be the monsters right now.
[00:45:14.540 --> 00:45:18.740]   - Well, I think that Apple gets so well together
[00:45:18.740 --> 00:45:19.580]   with those guys.
[00:45:19.580 --> 00:45:21.260]   I mean, you know, they're not, the problem is
[00:45:21.260 --> 00:45:22.580]   they can't make an agreement with Facebook
[00:45:22.580 --> 00:45:24.300]   because Facebook's too much of a control personality,
[00:45:24.300 --> 00:45:27.180]   and they just downright don't trust and don't like Google.
[00:45:27.180 --> 00:45:29.100]   - The site, apparently the Apple site does say
[00:45:29.100 --> 00:45:32.180]   for a series iPhone 4S only.
[00:45:32.180 --> 00:45:35.900]   Series is still on the iPhone, you know,
[00:45:35.900 --> 00:45:37.900]   they were offering this for a long time,
[00:45:37.900 --> 00:45:40.180]   but is working kind of sketchily right now
[00:45:40.180 --> 00:45:44.140]   and they say it will be turned off on October 14th.
[00:45:44.140 --> 00:45:47.060]   So if you're using Siri on an iPhone 3GS,
[00:45:47.060 --> 00:45:49.580]   or iPhone 4, oops.
[00:45:49.580 --> 00:45:50.500]   (laughs)
[00:45:50.500 --> 00:45:51.940]   - Still in the store, but you can't download it.
[00:45:51.940 --> 00:45:53.140]   You can download a bit of things.
[00:45:53.140 --> 00:45:53.980]   - It'll stop working.
[00:45:53.980 --> 00:45:54.820]   - It'll stop working.
[00:45:54.820 --> 00:45:57.100]   - Well, actually the iTunes store was saying,
[00:45:57.100 --> 00:45:59.020]   "Sorry, I can't, I know I said
[00:45:59.020 --> 00:46:00.660]   you could download this, but it's not available
[00:46:00.660 --> 00:46:01.500]   for some reason."
[00:46:01.500 --> 00:46:02.340]   - Right.
[00:46:02.340 --> 00:46:03.740]   - These are my asked me anymore.
[00:46:03.740 --> 00:46:06.380]   - Siri looks like the, really the interesting part
[00:46:06.380 --> 00:46:07.460]   of this story I have to say,
[00:46:07.460 --> 00:46:09.420]   and I'll be very curious to see how this works.
[00:46:09.420 --> 00:46:10.380]   But as soon as we get, you know,
[00:46:10.380 --> 00:46:14.140]   we'll be here in a couple of weeks with iPhone 4S.
[00:46:14.140 --> 00:46:15.180]   - I'm actually demo for you.
[00:46:15.180 --> 00:46:16.460]   - The more I think about Siri,
[00:46:16.460 --> 00:46:18.260]   and the more I think about the way I might use it,
[00:46:18.260 --> 00:46:20.060]   depending on how well it actually works.
[00:46:20.060 --> 00:46:22.180]   - You spend a lot of time in the car,
[00:46:22.180 --> 00:46:25.420]   or running as we saw in the video.
[00:46:25.420 --> 00:46:27.340]   This will be a great advantage to you.
[00:46:27.340 --> 00:46:28.180]   - Yeah.
[00:46:28.180 --> 00:46:33.180]   - I think it might be the FaceTime of the 4S,
[00:46:33.180 --> 00:46:36.500]   because every time we talk to people about FaceTime,
[00:46:36.500 --> 00:46:38.460]   either they never use it, or they love it,
[00:46:38.460 --> 00:46:39.620]   'cause they use it all the time.
[00:46:39.620 --> 00:46:41.860]   I think Siri might be in that same sort of category.
[00:46:41.860 --> 00:46:42.700]   - Right.
[00:46:42.700 --> 00:46:44.220]   - If it makes it, I guess it comes down to,
[00:46:44.220 --> 00:46:47.060]   is it going to be even superior
[00:46:47.060 --> 00:46:49.420]   to operating the keyboard directly?
[00:46:49.420 --> 00:46:51.300]   If it's faster to send a text message,
[00:46:51.300 --> 00:46:53.940]   or send an email to just hold down the comb button
[00:46:53.940 --> 00:46:57.060]   and say, "Send email to Chuck, subject line,
[00:46:57.060 --> 00:46:59.260]   "Hey, are we meeting for lunch content?"
[00:46:59.260 --> 00:47:00.620]   Yeah, "Hey, I'm confused,
[00:47:00.620 --> 00:47:02.100]   "we're meeting on Thursday or Friday,
[00:47:02.100 --> 00:47:04.860]   "send, if that's easier than just actually tapping it out
[00:47:04.860 --> 00:47:06.580]   "directly, then that's going to be a big win."
[00:47:06.580 --> 00:47:07.420]   - I'll tell you, you know, it's funny,
[00:47:07.420 --> 00:47:10.100]   'cause I've had, on Android for some time,
[00:47:10.100 --> 00:47:12.460]   I've had this capability, and I always forget to use it,
[00:47:12.460 --> 00:47:14.860]   and when I use it, I go, "I really should use this more."
[00:47:14.860 --> 00:47:16.620]   To me, what it really ends up coming down to
[00:47:16.620 --> 00:47:18.140]   is how accurate it is.
[00:47:18.140 --> 00:47:20.740]   If you have to fix it even one time in four,
[00:47:20.740 --> 00:47:21.740]   then it's not useful.
[00:47:21.740 --> 00:47:23.620]   If it's really reliably accurate,
[00:47:23.620 --> 00:47:26.740]   and even if it requires you speaking perfectly,
[00:47:26.740 --> 00:47:29.900]   or whatever, but if it would be reliably accurate,
[00:47:29.900 --> 00:47:31.700]   and you wouldn't have to pick up the phone and say,
[00:47:31.700 --> 00:47:34.500]   "Oh, let me fix that," I think you're more likely to use it.
[00:47:34.500 --> 00:47:36.060]   - And I think that's the reason we stopped using
[00:47:36.060 --> 00:47:38.100]   voice activation, or I stopped using it on the iPhone,
[00:47:38.100 --> 00:47:40.780]   was because it was calling the wrong people.
[00:47:40.780 --> 00:47:42.380]   It was, you know, immediately.
[00:47:42.380 --> 00:47:45.420]   - Yeah, my experience has been that I actually,
[00:47:45.420 --> 00:47:48.220]   usually, I rarely make phone calls on my iPhone,
[00:47:48.220 --> 00:47:51.020]   so I don't have a really big contact database there.
[00:47:51.020 --> 00:47:52.980]   But yeah, it's actually faster for me to hold down
[00:47:52.980 --> 00:47:56.140]   the voice button and say, "Call Dave, Google Voice."
[00:47:56.140 --> 00:47:58.500]   And then calling David, "Google Voice,"
[00:47:58.500 --> 00:48:00.940]   and then it goes on.
[00:48:00.940 --> 00:48:03.060]   So if they extend that to the entire experience,
[00:48:03.060 --> 00:48:03.900]   it's a pretty big deal.
[00:48:03.900 --> 00:48:06.020]   I mean, that's the first time,
[00:48:06.020 --> 00:48:08.380]   I was about to spoil my pick of the week, but yes.
[00:48:08.380 --> 00:48:09.220]   - (laughs)
[00:48:09.220 --> 00:48:10.060]   - Good week, good week.
[00:48:10.060 --> 00:48:12.380]   - Coming up in just a second, actually, Andy and I go
[00:48:12.380 --> 00:48:15.020]   from the Chicago Sun Times, Alex Lindsey from PixelCore.com.
[00:48:15.020 --> 00:48:16.780]   And I'm Leo LaPorte.
[00:48:16.780 --> 00:48:19.380]   We are brought to you today by Audible.com.
[00:48:19.380 --> 00:48:21.420]   In fact, Andy, if you've got a book pic,
[00:48:21.420 --> 00:48:22.260]   I'd love to hear it.
[00:48:22.260 --> 00:48:23.180]   I'm reading American Gods. - I do, indeed.
[00:48:23.180 --> 00:48:25.500]   - Or listening to American Gods right now,
[00:48:25.500 --> 00:48:26.380]   the Neil Gaiman novel.
[00:48:26.380 --> 00:48:29.060]   There's a new 10th anniversary edition, dramatized.
[00:48:29.060 --> 00:48:31.460]   I cannot put it down. - Yeah.
[00:48:31.460 --> 00:48:32.540]   - I'm listening at night.
[00:48:32.540 --> 00:48:34.980]   I'm getting in the car just to sit and listen.
[00:48:34.980 --> 00:48:37.260]   I'm spending more time on the stair climber.
[00:48:37.260 --> 00:48:39.900]   I think that's one of the things that's great about Audible.com.
[00:48:39.900 --> 00:48:41.620]   Not only do you get to read in times
[00:48:41.620 --> 00:48:42.740]   when you wouldn't normally read,
[00:48:42.740 --> 00:48:44.900]   which means for me, the difference between
[00:48:44.900 --> 00:48:46.140]   getting to read great literature
[00:48:46.140 --> 00:48:48.540]   and not reading it at all, because I'm so busy.
[00:48:48.540 --> 00:48:49.740]   But there's always time in the car,
[00:48:49.740 --> 00:48:50.780]   there's always time at the gym,
[00:48:50.780 --> 00:48:53.180]   there's always time doing the dishes or the laundry
[00:48:53.180 --> 00:48:54.980]   or mowing the lawn that you can listen.
[00:48:54.980 --> 00:48:57.820]   You'd be surprised to make people actually listen to Audible
[00:48:57.820 --> 00:48:59.580]   while mowing the lawn.
[00:48:59.580 --> 00:49:02.460]   It turns out to be a very popular place to listen to Audible.
[00:49:02.460 --> 00:49:04.140]   Go to Audible.com, browse around,
[00:49:04.140 --> 00:49:06.140]   take a look at all the choices you have.
[00:49:06.140 --> 00:49:11.140]   75,000 books, TV shows, performances, and more.
[00:49:11.140 --> 00:49:12.300]   And it's fantastic.
[00:49:12.300 --> 00:49:15.580]   Jeff Jarvis' new book, Public Parts, it's on Audible.
[00:49:15.580 --> 00:49:18.220]   William Shatner, Shatner Rules.
[00:49:18.220 --> 00:49:22.260]   Your key to understanding the Shatner verse is on Audible.
[00:49:22.260 --> 00:49:24.140]   With William Shatner, I gotta listen to him.
[00:49:24.140 --> 00:49:25.660]   Let's just see if Shatner's on.
[00:49:25.660 --> 00:49:28.220]   He's listed as the narrator.
[00:49:28.220 --> 00:49:29.220]   I think he must be.
[00:49:29.220 --> 00:49:31.980]   You love William Shatner.
[00:49:31.980 --> 00:49:34.140]   It's a bridge, but it still takes 23 hours.
[00:49:34.140 --> 00:49:36.660]   Four hours and 20s.
[00:49:36.660 --> 00:49:40.220]   I have their name above the title, but my name was in the title.
[00:49:40.220 --> 00:49:41.660]   How could I turn that down?
[00:49:41.660 --> 00:49:45.700]   Rule, always be yourself,
[00:49:45.700 --> 00:49:47.660]   especially if yourself has a high Q rating
[00:49:47.660 --> 00:49:50.860]   and is pleasing to a wide variety of advertisers.
[00:49:50.860 --> 00:49:52.220]   See Shatner.
[00:49:52.220 --> 00:49:55.780]   (both laughing)
[00:49:55.780 --> 00:49:57.500]   Okay, there's another thing.
[00:49:57.500 --> 00:49:59.140]   If you're trying to get your Shatner impression down,
[00:49:59.140 --> 00:50:01.100]   this would probably be a good thing to listen to.
[00:50:01.100 --> 00:50:03.100]   Andy, what are you listening to these days?
[00:50:03.100 --> 00:50:06.660]   Well, let's go from a bad actor to a really good actor.
[00:50:06.660 --> 00:50:10.340]   John Lithgow just released a memoir called "Drama"
[00:50:10.340 --> 00:50:15.260]   and Actors Education that I don't have the audio version of it,
[00:50:15.260 --> 00:50:16.580]   but I'm reading the Kindle version.
[00:50:16.580 --> 00:50:18.060]   I'm about halfway through it right now.
[00:50:18.060 --> 00:50:20.260]   And man, is he an entertaining storyteller.
[00:50:20.260 --> 00:50:23.900]   Right off the bat, he starts off by explaining how
[00:50:23.900 --> 00:50:29.180]   reading PG Woodhouse to his elderly parents,
[00:50:29.180 --> 00:50:31.460]   A, saved his dad's life and gave him an extra
[00:50:31.460 --> 00:50:32.540]   year and a half for the life,
[00:50:32.540 --> 00:50:34.980]   but also helped him to understand at age
[00:50:34.980 --> 00:50:38.860]   like 52 or 53,
[00:50:38.860 --> 00:50:40.740]   like exactly what he was as an actor
[00:50:40.740 --> 00:50:42.380]   and what his life was all about.
[00:50:42.380 --> 00:50:43.860]   And then the stories just go on from there.
[00:50:43.860 --> 00:50:44.940]   It's not all about,
[00:50:44.940 --> 00:50:47.300]   and then by the time I looked up of his
[00:50:47.300 --> 00:50:49.740]   on a Greyhound bus in Tulsa, Oklahoma,
[00:50:49.740 --> 00:50:52.540]   I was wearing a tutu and holding the remnants of a burrito
[00:50:52.540 --> 00:50:53.860]   and I don't know how I got there.
[00:50:53.860 --> 00:50:55.860]   You know, Lithgow's done some narration himself.
[00:50:55.860 --> 00:50:57.180]   He did a bunch of Dr. Seuss stuff,
[00:50:57.180 --> 00:50:58.020]   so he does this one.
[00:50:58.020 --> 00:50:59.420]   Let me just play a little of John Lithgow
[00:50:59.420 --> 00:51:02.420]   reading his book "Drama" and Actors Education.
[00:51:02.420 --> 00:51:03.940]   This is one of the things I like about Audible.
[00:51:03.940 --> 00:51:06.300]   You can hear what the narrator sounds like
[00:51:06.300 --> 00:51:07.860]   before you buy the book,
[00:51:07.860 --> 00:51:11.260]   just press the little button that says "Sample" here.
[00:51:11.260 --> 00:51:16.380]   And if Leo would press the button, I did, but it's not.
[00:51:16.380 --> 00:51:17.220]   There it is.
[00:51:17.220 --> 00:51:19.340]   My mother, my father, and I gradually fell
[00:51:19.340 --> 00:51:21.780]   into a predictable routine.
[00:51:21.780 --> 00:51:23.500]   I fixed their meals.
[00:51:23.500 --> 00:51:27.740]   I took Dad on short, halting constitutional walks.
[00:51:27.740 --> 00:51:32.460]   I bathed him, powdered him, and got rid of that awful rash.
[00:51:32.460 --> 00:51:34.580]   He'd gotten shabby and uncampered.
[00:51:34.580 --> 00:51:37.980]   - You know what I love is that when you get a great actor,
[00:51:37.980 --> 00:51:39.180]   especially reading his own book,
[00:51:39.180 --> 00:51:42.100]   you're having a conversation with John Lithgow.
[00:51:42.100 --> 00:51:43.180]   That's awesome.
[00:51:43.180 --> 00:51:44.620]   Can't wait to listen to that.
[00:51:44.620 --> 00:51:48.380]   So here's the deal, go to audible.com/macbreak
[00:51:48.380 --> 00:51:50.180]   and you'll be signing up for the gold account.
[00:51:50.180 --> 00:51:51.780]   That's the Book of Month subscription.
[00:51:51.780 --> 00:51:53.380]   First month's free.
[00:51:53.380 --> 00:51:55.340]   You can cancel anytime, so that means your first book
[00:51:55.340 --> 00:51:58.140]   is free and you can keep it forever.
[00:51:58.140 --> 00:52:00.060]   You don't have to pay a penny if you don't want to.
[00:52:00.060 --> 00:52:01.260]   I have a feeling you'll stick around.
[00:52:01.260 --> 00:52:03.620]   Once you, this is the really amazing thing.
[00:52:03.620 --> 00:52:04.700]   You start to look at Audible.
[00:52:04.700 --> 00:52:07.580]   Look, there's the new Neil Stevenson novel.
[00:52:07.580 --> 00:52:09.420]   And you just know, I got, I mean,
[00:52:09.420 --> 00:52:11.020]   every time I do the commercial for Audible,
[00:52:11.020 --> 00:52:12.500]   I find three more books I want to listen to.
[00:52:12.500 --> 00:52:14.660]   And usually Andy's recommendation is one of them.
[00:52:14.660 --> 00:52:15.740]   Always it is.
[00:52:15.740 --> 00:52:17.460]   He recommended the American Gods.
[00:52:17.460 --> 00:52:19.820]   He's recommended everything I'm listening to right now.
[00:52:19.820 --> 00:52:21.740]   Audible.com/macbreak.
[00:52:21.740 --> 00:52:23.540]   Thank you for your support Audible
[00:52:23.540 --> 00:52:27.980]   and everybody should try this works on the iPad, Android phones.
[00:52:27.980 --> 00:52:30.700]   Yes, even the late lamented Zoom.
[00:52:30.700 --> 00:52:31.980]   Audible.com/macbreak.
[00:52:31.980 --> 00:52:33.540]   Did you see that?
[00:52:33.540 --> 00:52:36.020]   The iPod killer is finally dead.
[00:52:36.020 --> 00:52:37.100]   Oh my gosh.
[00:52:37.100 --> 00:52:39.500]   - Can I have a Zoom?
[00:52:39.500 --> 00:52:40.900]   - Yeah, I have a Zoom, I have a Zoom HT,
[00:52:40.900 --> 00:52:42.260]   which actually I liked a lot.
[00:52:42.260 --> 00:52:44.980]   I liked it a lot except it seemed like every time I picked it up,
[00:52:44.980 --> 00:52:47.940]   I had to re-sync to get to authorize again.
[00:52:47.940 --> 00:52:49.100]   - Well, it wasn't competent.
[00:52:49.100 --> 00:52:49.940]   - And then I had to plug in.
[00:52:49.940 --> 00:52:50.860]   - And then this is exactly why Apple
[00:52:50.860 --> 00:52:53.700]   doesn't do a subscription service is that.
[00:52:53.700 --> 00:52:54.980]   - But then I had to, the problem is,
[00:52:54.980 --> 00:52:56.540]   is if all I had to do was get to a wifi
[00:52:56.540 --> 00:52:58.100]   and just go click, click, click, and it worked,
[00:52:58.100 --> 00:52:58.940]   it would be fine.
[00:52:58.940 --> 00:52:59.780]   But the problem was is that,
[00:52:59.780 --> 00:53:01.300]   oh, I have to relaunch into Windows,
[00:53:01.300 --> 00:53:02.340]   I plug it into my computer,
[00:53:02.340 --> 00:53:04.100]   and then I have to let the computer do it.
[00:53:04.100 --> 00:53:07.780]   And just to say that, oh yeah, I'm still subscribed.
[00:53:07.780 --> 00:53:09.500]   You know, and that was what killed it for me.
[00:53:09.500 --> 00:53:11.420]   And then I just, I was so excited about it,
[00:53:11.420 --> 00:53:12.860]   and I just stopped using it.
[00:53:12.860 --> 00:53:15.020]   - So we should, that's a story, I guess,
[00:53:15.020 --> 00:53:15.860]   that we should mention.
[00:53:15.860 --> 00:53:19.580]   We have, there aren't very many non or other Apple
[00:53:19.580 --> 00:53:21.820]   related stories than the big announcement,
[00:53:21.820 --> 00:53:25.820]   but that's one of them that the Zoom is dead.
[00:53:25.820 --> 00:53:27.740]   Microsoft finally admitted it.
[00:53:27.740 --> 00:53:30.820]   - Of course, you know, the Windows Phone 7 really is a Zoom.
[00:53:30.820 --> 00:53:34.220]   And Zoom passes a live Zoom, they called it Zoom Music Pass now.
[00:53:34.220 --> 00:53:36.460]   - And the Zoom HD was our first look at the Metro interface,
[00:53:36.460 --> 00:53:37.940]   which is now at the core of Windows 8.
[00:53:37.940 --> 00:53:39.980]   So it's a historical artifact, absolutely.
[00:53:39.980 --> 00:53:40.980]   - Yeah, I got to find mine.
[00:53:40.980 --> 00:53:42.660]   And I have to say, I know some people love the interface,
[00:53:42.660 --> 00:53:44.980]   I never understood it.
[00:53:44.980 --> 00:53:47.300]   I'm too, I'm not smart enough.
[00:53:47.300 --> 00:53:48.420]   - Be careful, 'cause if you say that,
[00:53:48.420 --> 00:53:50.660]   they're gonna call you up and say,
[00:53:50.660 --> 00:53:54.420]   and let's, how would you like to take the Windows Phone Challenge?
[00:53:54.420 --> 00:53:55.420]   - I'll take a Windows Full Challenge.
[00:53:55.420 --> 00:53:56.700]   They wanna send me one, I'll test it.
[00:53:56.700 --> 00:53:58.980]   Hey, I got an Android, I got an iPhone.
[00:53:58.980 --> 00:54:00.860]   - That's what I wanna do, I wanna do one of each.
[00:54:00.860 --> 00:54:02.180]   One of the top of the line new phones.
[00:54:02.180 --> 00:54:03.580]   - But I'm not gonna buy one.
[00:54:03.580 --> 00:54:07.220]   So if Microsoft wants me to test a Windows Phone,
[00:54:07.220 --> 00:54:08.060]   they have to send me one.
[00:54:08.060 --> 00:54:10.580]   - I actually bought one, but then I gave it to Tony Wang.
[00:54:10.580 --> 00:54:11.660]   - I'm a competitor.
[00:54:11.660 --> 00:54:14.180]   Amazon Kindle Fire, of course, the big announcement,
[00:54:14.180 --> 00:54:16.700]   the iPad, I'm not killer, I would say it will take
[00:54:16.700 --> 00:54:20.700]   a chunk of iPads business, was announced last week,
[00:54:20.700 --> 00:54:23.380]   and according to eDataSource, which actually does
[00:54:23.380 --> 00:54:27.500]   a pretty good job of assessing by looking at emails,
[00:54:27.500 --> 00:54:30.340]   says that they estimate 95,000 pre-orders
[00:54:30.340 --> 00:54:32.980]   for the Kindle Fire on day one.
[00:54:32.980 --> 00:54:34.460]   Not surprising, I ordered one,
[00:54:34.460 --> 00:54:37.820]   I also bought the new little Kindle and I love it.
[00:54:37.820 --> 00:54:38.660]   It's great stuff.
[00:54:38.660 --> 00:54:40.580]   I'm very curious to see what happens with the Fire.
[00:54:40.580 --> 00:54:43.260]   I have a feeling that it won't cannibalize the iPads.
[00:54:43.260 --> 00:54:45.220]   The iPad does so much more, including having a camera
[00:54:45.220 --> 00:54:49.820]   and Bluetooth, but at $199.
[00:54:49.820 --> 00:54:50.660]   - I think the biggest thing--
[00:54:50.660 --> 00:54:52.100]   - I think, go ahead.
[00:54:52.100 --> 00:54:55.660]   - I was about to say, I think that it doesn't compete
[00:54:55.660 --> 00:54:57.740]   with the iPad, it complements the iPad,
[00:54:57.740 --> 00:55:00.740]   and it means that every other tablet manufacturer
[00:55:00.740 --> 00:55:04.180]   is now so screwed right now, because right now,
[00:55:04.180 --> 00:55:07.180]   if someone has 500 bucks, they're gonna be buying the iPad.
[00:55:07.180 --> 00:55:09.540]   Now, and if they have 200 bucks, 250 bucks,
[00:55:09.540 --> 00:55:12.580]   they want a smaller tablet that's gonna be the Kindle Fire.
[00:55:12.580 --> 00:55:14.260]   So where does that leave you if you had plans
[00:55:14.260 --> 00:55:18.500]   to sell a $399 10-inch Android tablet?
[00:55:18.500 --> 00:55:21.780]   It's like, oh goodness, it's back to the drawing board for you.
[00:55:21.780 --> 00:55:25.660]   - Yeah, and from this news from ABC,
[00:55:25.660 --> 00:55:28.660]   George Stephanopoulos interviewing the president
[00:55:28.660 --> 00:55:31.740]   turns out that he had access to the iPad 2
[00:55:31.740 --> 00:55:34.460]   before any of us did.
[00:55:34.460 --> 00:55:36.620]   Barack Obama had a dinner at the White House
[00:55:36.620 --> 00:55:39.460]   for tech leaders, including Steve Jobs
[00:55:39.460 --> 00:55:41.860]   sitting on his left, Mark Zuckerberg,
[00:55:41.860 --> 00:55:46.020]   sitting to his right, and at that dinner apparently,
[00:55:46.020 --> 00:55:49.500]   about two weeks before the iPad 2 was shipped,
[00:55:49.500 --> 00:55:52.860]   Steve gave the president his very own iPad 2.
[00:55:52.860 --> 00:55:54.820]   I guess you can trust--
[00:55:54.820 --> 00:55:56.260]   - They still made him sign an NDA.
[00:55:56.260 --> 00:55:59.700]   - I think you could probably trust a president
[00:55:59.700 --> 00:56:01.820]   to keep secrets, he is a Blackberry user,
[00:56:01.820 --> 00:56:04.620]   but he's well known for using an iPad,
[00:56:04.620 --> 00:56:07.700]   and here is his revelation to George Stephanopoulos.
[00:56:07.700 --> 00:56:09.860]   - You know, I'm pretty eclectic.
[00:56:09.860 --> 00:56:13.580]   You know, I read a lot of newspapers
[00:56:13.580 --> 00:56:16.780]   that I used to read in print, I now read on the web.
[00:56:16.780 --> 00:56:18.060]   - Yeah, my bad, or just--
[00:56:18.060 --> 00:56:22.860]   - I've got an iPad, and Steve Jobs actually gave it to me
[00:56:22.860 --> 00:56:24.500]   a little bit early.
[00:56:24.500 --> 00:56:25.340]   - That's pretty cool.
[00:56:25.340 --> 00:56:26.500]   - Yeah, it was cool.
[00:56:26.500 --> 00:56:27.340]   (laughing)
[00:56:27.340 --> 00:56:29.260]   - See, that's even the president!
[00:56:29.260 --> 00:56:31.100]   - The president thinks it's pretty cool.
[00:56:31.100 --> 00:56:32.420]   - Not just that, but it doesn't matter
[00:56:32.420 --> 00:56:33.620]   if you're the president of the United States,
[00:56:33.620 --> 00:56:35.180]   if you can name drop Steve Jobs,
[00:56:35.180 --> 00:56:37.500]   you're gonna name drop Steve Jobs.
[00:56:37.500 --> 00:56:38.740]   I was having dinner with Steve,
[00:56:38.740 --> 00:56:41.260]   oh, I'm sorry, you know him as Steve Jobs.
[00:56:41.260 --> 00:56:42.700]   - Jobs, that,
[00:56:42.700 --> 00:56:44.300]   Jobs on his left and Zuck on his right,
[00:56:44.300 --> 00:56:45.420]   you gotta think of 27,
[00:56:45.420 --> 00:56:47.500]   actually he was 26 at the time, 26 year old kid,
[00:56:47.500 --> 00:56:49.300]   he's sitting next to the president of the United States.
[00:56:49.300 --> 00:56:52.300]   He's thinking, yeah, I'm kind of something special.
[00:56:52.300 --> 00:56:53.140]   - You know what he's thinking,
[00:56:53.140 --> 00:56:54.860]   I'm two seats away from Steve Jobs.
[00:56:54.860 --> 00:56:57.340]   (laughing)
[00:56:57.340 --> 00:56:59.420]   - Yeah, you wonder if there's a little spitball in fighting,
[00:56:59.420 --> 00:57:01.940]   maybe a food fight going on in the background there.
[00:57:01.940 --> 00:57:05.300]   Let's get Andy Inako's pick of the week, Mr. Inako.
[00:57:05.300 --> 00:57:08.420]   - Leo, I know that you got one of these in the mail too.
[00:57:08.420 --> 00:57:09.620]   It's more perfect than anything else.
[00:57:09.620 --> 00:57:12.860]   Plantronics has a new-ish Bluetooth headset.
[00:57:12.860 --> 00:57:15.860]   They're calling the Mark M-A-R-Q-E
[00:57:15.860 --> 00:57:17.340]   that has a couple of really cool features.
[00:57:17.340 --> 00:57:18.860]   - Look how small that is, first of all.
[00:57:18.860 --> 00:57:20.180]   - It's really, really tiny,
[00:57:20.180 --> 00:57:24.620]   and also it really has cool like iPhone type styling.
[00:57:24.620 --> 00:57:25.780]   As a matter of fact,
[00:57:25.780 --> 00:57:29.660]   for the last time until the real iPhone 5 gets released,
[00:57:29.660 --> 00:57:32.460]   the waitress at the diner this morning asked me
[00:57:32.460 --> 00:57:34.580]   what I thought the new iPhone would be like.
[00:57:34.580 --> 00:57:36.540]   I was wearing this, I was tempted to take it out of my ears.
[00:57:36.540 --> 00:57:38.140]   Oh, this is it, it's all voice commands,
[00:57:38.140 --> 00:57:39.820]   this all talks to you.
[00:57:39.820 --> 00:57:41.700]   Super, but it came in yesterday,
[00:57:41.700 --> 00:57:43.060]   I've been wearing it for two days straight.
[00:57:43.060 --> 00:57:46.020]   I think it's the first Bluetooth headset that I've ever tried
[00:57:46.020 --> 00:57:47.140]   where I can actually wear it,
[00:57:47.140 --> 00:57:50.020]   and it doesn't feel as though I've got this thing stuck
[00:57:50.020 --> 00:57:51.020]   in my ear.
[00:57:51.020 --> 00:57:53.060]   It actually can, like a lot of headsets,
[00:57:53.060 --> 00:57:54.780]   it can actually talk to you.
[00:57:54.780 --> 00:57:56.500]   So when you actually pair it,
[00:57:56.500 --> 00:57:59.020]   it actually talks you through the process of pairing
[00:57:59.020 --> 00:58:00.060]   through a device.
[00:58:00.060 --> 00:58:01.300]   It's pretty clear.
[00:58:01.300 --> 00:58:04.420]   There's actually also an iPhone app that you can download.
[00:58:04.420 --> 00:58:06.100]   So if you wanna check what the sound quality is.
[00:58:06.100 --> 00:58:06.900]   - Yeah, I was a little disappointed.
[00:58:06.900 --> 00:58:08.500]   - I did that, I played back the sound quality.
[00:58:08.500 --> 00:58:12.180]   I was a little disappointed with how I sounded.
[00:58:12.180 --> 00:58:14.020]   - Yeah, it's a Bluetooth headset,
[00:58:14.020 --> 00:58:18.140]   so already the bar is set a little bit low.
[00:58:18.140 --> 00:58:19.620]   I've yet to find a Bluetooth headset
[00:58:19.620 --> 00:58:23.340]   that made me want to forget where my wired headset is.
[00:58:23.340 --> 00:58:26.340]   I really think that if you really wanna be heard,
[00:58:26.340 --> 00:58:28.380]   clearly you still gotta go with wired.
[00:58:28.380 --> 00:58:31.860]   But realize that I'm one of these people
[00:58:31.860 --> 00:58:35.460]   who's been training everybody I know not to call me.
[00:58:35.460 --> 00:58:38.340]   If you gotta contact me through the phone,
[00:58:38.340 --> 00:58:40.100]   send me an email 'cause I'll check the email.
[00:58:40.100 --> 00:58:41.700]   If you can't do that, send me a text.
[00:58:41.700 --> 00:58:43.980]   'Cause if there's a phone call that comes in,
[00:58:43.980 --> 00:58:45.660]   chances are I won't even check for the voicemail
[00:58:45.660 --> 00:58:46.940]   for an entire week.
[00:58:46.940 --> 00:58:49.140]   So even on that basis, just walking around
[00:58:49.140 --> 00:58:50.700]   with this thing in my ear for two days,
[00:58:50.700 --> 00:58:53.740]   listening to podcasts, and still having an ear open
[00:58:53.740 --> 00:58:56.220]   so that I can pay attention to traffic and stuff like that
[00:58:56.220 --> 00:58:57.140]   was a cool thing.
[00:58:57.140 --> 00:59:02.140]   I'm guessing that when Siri, when I get the 4S to test out,
[00:59:02.140 --> 00:59:05.780]   and if it really does turn out to be a really great way
[00:59:05.780 --> 00:59:08.780]   just to control my iPhone and interact with my iPhone,
[00:59:08.780 --> 00:59:11.500]   then I think that a Bluetooth headset will kind of be
[00:59:11.500 --> 00:59:14.460]   upgraded for a lot of people from something you don't need
[00:59:14.460 --> 00:59:16.020]   because I don't use the phone very much,
[00:59:16.020 --> 00:59:18.220]   to something you wanna have because it allows you
[00:59:18.220 --> 00:59:21.340]   to use your phone in a completely hands-free way,
[00:59:21.340 --> 00:59:23.980]   whether it's actually, you're driving,
[00:59:23.980 --> 00:59:24.920]   you're actually having your out,
[00:59:24.920 --> 00:59:28.000]   you're active on the go lifestyle where you're too busy
[00:59:28.000 --> 00:59:29.560]   doing this with your hands while you walk
[00:59:29.560 --> 00:59:31.960]   to actually operate your iPhone,
[00:59:31.960 --> 00:59:33.560]   or whether you just wanna be a lazy bum
[00:59:33.560 --> 00:59:34.640]   who doesn't wanna lift up his hands
[00:59:34.640 --> 00:59:36.480]   for any reason whatsoever.
[00:59:36.480 --> 00:59:38.760]   For all the styling, for all the coolness about it,
[00:59:38.760 --> 00:59:40.800]   it's pretty cheap, it's only about, I believe it lists
[00:59:40.800 --> 00:59:43.200]   for like 60 bucks, as made by planned Toronto,
[00:59:43.200 --> 00:59:45.600]   in a sense called the Mark M.A.R.Q.U.E.
[00:59:45.600 --> 00:59:47.480]   - Yeah, I was listening to Audible books on it
[00:59:47.480 --> 00:59:50.040]   and podcasts sound great and--
[00:59:50.040 --> 00:59:51.700]   - It is light, boy.
[00:59:51.700 --> 00:59:53.640]   I know I'll lose it. - He knows it soon.
[00:59:53.640 --> 00:59:57.040]   I mean, it's so tinesy, but yeah, I liked it a lot.
[00:59:57.040 --> 00:59:59.000]   I thought it was pretty cool.
[00:59:59.000 --> 01:00:02.040]   And they include something called Vocalist with it,
[01:00:02.040 --> 01:00:04.160]   which is their version of Siri,
[01:00:04.160 --> 01:00:06.680]   and it's actually a brand--
[01:00:06.680 --> 01:00:07.520]   - Subscription, sir.
[01:00:07.520 --> 01:00:08.360]   - Yeah, subscription.
[01:00:08.360 --> 01:00:11.820]   I already belonged to for many years, dial2do.com,
[01:00:11.820 --> 01:00:14.800]   D-I-A-A-L, the number two, d-o.com, which I love.
[01:00:14.800 --> 01:00:16.240]   And it does a lot of the Siri things,
[01:00:16.240 --> 01:00:17.760]   you could say, send an email to Andy,
[01:00:17.760 --> 01:00:20.000]   you could do a lot of things that Siri does,
[01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:23.280]   but making a phone call to the dial to do servers.
[01:00:24.120 --> 01:00:26.600]   Actually, it's the best way to get dial2do
[01:00:26.600 --> 01:00:29.400]   because it's $3.99 a month compared to,
[01:00:29.400 --> 01:00:31.840]   I think I was paying $5.99 a month.
[01:00:31.840 --> 01:00:33.560]   So that's a good deal.
[01:00:33.560 --> 01:00:35.040]   Thank you, Andy.
[01:00:35.040 --> 01:00:38.440]   I'm gonna do mine right now because once you see Alex's--
[01:00:38.440 --> 01:00:39.280]   (laughing)
[01:00:39.280 --> 01:00:42.120]   - You're not gonna really care about anything I say.
[01:00:42.120 --> 01:00:44.920]   So I don't know, are you, are you use Reddit?
[01:00:44.920 --> 01:00:46.360]   Either of you use Reddit, I love Reddit.
[01:00:46.360 --> 01:00:48.240]   I like to read Reddit all the time.
[01:00:48.240 --> 01:00:53.000]   Reddit is a website that is kind of like dig.
[01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:55.160]   You know, it's a user news site
[01:00:55.160 --> 01:00:56.760]   where people post funny things
[01:00:56.760 --> 01:00:59.240]   and then you can vote them up or down
[01:00:59.240 --> 01:01:01.920]   and the stuff that's highly voted to put comments on.
[01:01:01.920 --> 01:01:04.160]   They've got an Ask Me Anything feature that's great.
[01:01:04.160 --> 01:01:07.540]   It's kind of like a Quora for the rest of us.
[01:01:07.540 --> 01:01:11.760]   Our TNT folks have a subreddit that lets,
[01:01:11.760 --> 01:01:12.920]   and you can create subreddits.
[01:01:12.920 --> 01:01:14.480]   In fact, bread's gotten a little bit of trouble
[01:01:14.480 --> 01:01:15.720]   because of these subreddits.
[01:01:15.720 --> 01:01:16.880]   Anybody can create a subreddit
[01:01:16.880 --> 01:01:18.000]   that's their own personal Reddit.
[01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:20.920]   Connie Nast opens it, but they spun it out recently
[01:01:20.920 --> 01:01:22.960]   and said, "You know, we're gonna make sure Reddit keeps it
[01:01:22.960 --> 01:01:24.320]   "Spirit and I like that."
[01:01:24.320 --> 01:01:29.320]   I found a really interesting Reddit app for Lion.
[01:01:29.320 --> 01:01:32.680]   It's called Envelope.
[01:01:32.680 --> 01:01:35.920]   And let me show you, it's on the App Store.
[01:01:35.920 --> 01:01:37.720]   It's not very, I think it's a couple of bucks.
[01:01:37.720 --> 01:01:39.440]   And what it essentially is,
[01:01:39.440 --> 01:01:41.640]   you know, you can use Reddit on the web, of course.
[01:01:41.640 --> 01:01:44.240]   But if you like to use Lion's full screen feature
[01:01:44.240 --> 01:01:47.440]   and you kind of wanna make it be like a tablet version,
[01:01:47.440 --> 01:01:49.680]   it's got the videos are built in,
[01:01:49.680 --> 01:01:51.920]   websites built in, you can browse through stuff,
[01:01:51.920 --> 01:01:54.920]   you can vote up and down, do all the Reddit stuff, star stuff.
[01:01:54.920 --> 01:01:59.920]   I think this is actually a very cool way to use Reddit.
[01:01:59.920 --> 01:02:03.240]   You can have a hot, new, controversial,
[01:02:03.240 --> 01:02:05.720]   all the stuff that you'd get on the website.
[01:02:05.720 --> 01:02:07.840]   You can have saved articles or hidden articles.
[01:02:07.840 --> 01:02:10.160]   If you use Reddit, this is just kind of a fun,
[01:02:10.160 --> 01:02:12.280]   tablet-y way to browse Reddit.
[01:02:12.280 --> 01:02:14.720]   By the way, I'm told that Reddit already has
[01:02:14.720 --> 01:02:17.480]   a squirrel Tim Cook meme.
[01:02:17.480 --> 01:02:18.400]   (laughing)
[01:02:18.400 --> 01:02:20.920]   I called it going on.
[01:02:20.920 --> 01:02:25.920]   So this is called Envelope and it is on the App Store.
[01:02:25.920 --> 01:02:27.920]   That's my pick.
[01:02:27.920 --> 01:02:33.120]   And now, get ready for Alex's pick.
[01:02:33.120 --> 01:02:36.960]   Oh my God, is that a SCUD missile launcher on the table?
[01:02:36.960 --> 01:02:38.080]   You're just happy to see me.
[01:02:38.080 --> 01:02:40.240]   - Oh, so I have to admit--
[01:02:40.240 --> 01:02:41.880]   - 399 on envelope, thank you.
[01:02:41.880 --> 01:02:45.720]   - I am, this is my, I think my first though.
[01:02:45.720 --> 01:02:46.560]   - Look at this, folks.
[01:02:46.560 --> 01:02:47.760]   - Okay, we gotta move, this is a--
[01:02:47.760 --> 01:02:49.600]   - Okay, just, it was a root purchase arm.
[01:02:49.600 --> 01:02:51.280]   God, this is like, I opened it up
[01:02:51.280 --> 01:02:52.240]   at like two o'clock in the morning
[01:02:52.240 --> 01:02:53.800]   and I'm like, this will look so good on Mac.
[01:02:53.800 --> 01:02:55.120]   - Do we have the, do we have the--
[01:02:55.120 --> 01:02:55.960]   - It was literally the camera.
[01:02:55.960 --> 01:02:57.960]   - This is gonna look so great on Maccure.
[01:02:57.960 --> 01:02:58.800]   - Let me grab this laptop.
[01:02:58.800 --> 01:03:00.880]   - And I was like hoping that it worked.
[01:03:00.880 --> 01:03:02.240]   - It's USB, it's got--
[01:03:02.240 --> 01:03:02.240]   - USB-
[01:03:02.240 --> 01:03:03.560]   - It's got your own dedicated software.
[01:03:03.560 --> 01:03:05.560]   - You got your own dedicated software that controls it.
[01:03:05.560 --> 01:03:07.720]   So I'm just using my arrow keys to,
[01:03:07.720 --> 01:03:08.960]   I'm waiting for the overhead to--
[01:03:08.960 --> 01:03:10.200]   - We'll get you a shot of it in a second.
[01:03:10.200 --> 01:03:11.040]   There it is.
[01:03:11.040 --> 01:03:14.040]   - So I'm just using my little arrow keys to, you know--
[01:03:14.040 --> 01:03:15.480]   - It's turning itself.
[01:03:15.480 --> 01:03:17.280]   - Yeah, so I can control it.
[01:03:17.280 --> 01:03:19.480]   - And then if you work in an office, if you work in a cubicle,
[01:03:19.480 --> 01:03:20.600]   you've got to have this.
[01:03:20.600 --> 01:03:23.200]   - And so, and then if I, I believe I hit the space bar.
[01:03:23.200 --> 01:03:24.040]   - Yep.
[01:03:24.040 --> 01:03:25.840]   Oh my God, don't shoot.
[01:03:25.840 --> 01:03:26.680]   - Whoa.
[01:03:26.680 --> 01:03:28.240]   - If you really, I think you're gonna leave.
[01:03:28.240 --> 01:03:29.080]   - That actually got it.
[01:03:29.080 --> 01:03:29.920]   - Can you aim?
[01:03:29.920 --> 01:03:30.760]   - Can you aim up and down too?
[01:03:30.760 --> 01:03:31.960]   - Yeah, yeah, so you can go.
[01:03:31.960 --> 01:03:33.320]   I'll shoot you a little lower next time.
[01:03:33.320 --> 01:03:34.520]   - Oh my God, well shoot me.
[01:03:34.520 --> 01:03:36.040]   - Here, we'll shoot, see if we get that lamp.
[01:03:36.040 --> 01:03:36.880]   - You ready?
[01:03:36.880 --> 01:03:37.720]   - Okay.
[01:03:37.720 --> 01:03:38.560]   - Okay, we're gonna try to get the lamp here.
[01:03:38.560 --> 01:03:39.920]   So he's aiming.
[01:03:39.920 --> 01:03:41.480]   This is--
[01:03:41.480 --> 01:03:42.320]   - No.
[01:03:42.320 --> 01:03:43.240]   - You can't get the lamp.
[01:03:43.240 --> 01:03:44.800]   That's what I'm talking about.
[01:03:44.800 --> 01:03:45.800]   - Very nicely done.
[01:03:45.800 --> 01:03:46.920]   - Yes, thank you very much.
[01:03:46.920 --> 01:03:47.760]   I've been--
[01:03:47.760 --> 01:03:49.880]   - Anyway, and it's Army Green.
[01:03:49.880 --> 01:03:52.520]   - It's Army Green and it actually has a little bit of range.
[01:03:52.520 --> 01:03:54.360]   They are nerfs, so they're pretty safe.
[01:03:54.360 --> 01:03:58.200]   But it definitely has a pretty good range
[01:03:58.200 --> 01:04:01.680]   and it's called the, it's Dream Cheeky Storm,
[01:04:01.680 --> 01:04:03.080]   Computer-controlled Missile Launcher.
[01:04:03.080 --> 01:04:04.200]   - That's on Amazon.
[01:04:04.200 --> 01:04:05.040]   But you got one thing.
[01:04:05.040 --> 01:04:06.880]   - The only thing is, it does require some explanation
[01:04:06.880 --> 01:04:09.200]   when your son runs up while you're in the kitchen
[01:04:09.200 --> 01:04:12.000]   and says, "Dad, can we play with the gun again?"
[01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:14.480]   And you know, no, the problem is I'm from--
[01:04:14.480 --> 01:04:15.520]   - Where they actually do play with us.
[01:04:15.520 --> 01:04:17.440]   - I'm from the Appalachia where a four-year-old
[01:04:17.440 --> 01:04:19.440]   would be expected to already use a gun.
[01:04:19.440 --> 01:04:22.560]   And my wife is not from Appalachia.
[01:04:22.560 --> 01:04:24.560]   And you know, and--
[01:04:24.560 --> 01:04:26.160]   - And probably doesn't like guns too much.
[01:04:26.160 --> 01:04:28.520]   - And you get this big wide open look on her eyes,
[01:04:28.520 --> 01:04:31.480]   like, are you out there teaching our son how to fire a gun?
[01:04:31.480 --> 01:04:33.400]   And I'm like, it's a nerf gun.
[01:04:33.400 --> 01:04:34.480]   It's a nerf gun.
[01:04:34.480 --> 01:04:35.360]   He loves it, by the way.
[01:04:35.360 --> 01:04:36.720]   He thinks it's the coolest thing--
[01:04:36.720 --> 01:04:39.040]   - Dream Cheeky makes some interesting stuff.
[01:04:39.040 --> 01:04:41.680]   Look, they've got a mailbox friends alert.
[01:04:41.680 --> 01:04:42.680]   They've got a big red button.
[01:04:42.680 --> 01:04:43.720]   - They've got a lot of fun stuff.
[01:04:43.720 --> 01:04:47.360]   - And they've got, this is the Storm OIC Missile Launch.
[01:04:47.360 --> 01:04:49.280]   - Yeah, and it's a lot of fun.
[01:04:49.280 --> 01:04:53.840]   - So it's silly, it's a silly purchase.
[01:04:53.840 --> 01:04:56.120]   I will admit to you, but you can imagine
[01:04:56.120 --> 01:04:58.520]   how many hours could be lost in full open--
[01:04:58.520 --> 01:04:59.360]   - I'll send it there, mission.
[01:04:59.360 --> 01:05:00.200]   - Work out.
[01:05:00.200 --> 01:05:01.040]   - I cut it.
[01:05:01.040 --> 01:05:02.720]   - Dream Cheeky was established in 2008
[01:05:02.720 --> 01:05:05.600]   to supply customers with the gadgets they need
[01:05:05.600 --> 01:05:07.440]   to harass coworkers.
[01:05:07.440 --> 01:05:09.680]   (laughing)
[01:05:10.680 --> 01:05:12.680]   - So there you have it.
[01:05:12.680 --> 01:05:13.680]   Wow, that is--
[01:05:13.680 --> 01:05:14.680]   - So anyway--
[01:05:14.680 --> 01:05:16.680]   - That is really, they make a couple of the warmer,
[01:05:16.680 --> 01:05:18.680]   I launched Thunder.
[01:05:18.680 --> 01:05:21.680]   This is the best of the Storm OIC Missile.
[01:05:21.680 --> 01:05:23.680]   But I guess we've missed the Woot opportunity,
[01:05:23.680 --> 01:05:26.680]   but 37.99 on Amazon.
[01:05:26.680 --> 01:05:27.680]   - Good luck.
[01:05:27.680 --> 01:05:30.680]   - And it does have a safety lock to make sure you don't.
[01:05:30.680 --> 01:05:31.680]   - Yeah, as it should.
[01:05:31.680 --> 01:05:33.680]   - We're going, okay, here we go.
[01:05:33.680 --> 01:05:35.680]   - I wish we could see the trajectory here,
[01:05:35.680 --> 01:05:37.680]   but I guess we can't.
[01:05:37.680 --> 01:05:39.680]   - Here, shoot the camera.
[01:05:39.680 --> 01:05:40.680]   - I think that's the closest.
[01:05:40.680 --> 01:05:41.680]   - Can you hit the camera?
[01:05:41.680 --> 01:05:42.680]   - Here, you have to turn it to it in front,
[01:05:42.680 --> 01:05:43.680]   so you have to kind of get it.
[01:05:43.680 --> 01:05:44.680]   - I see, so I see.
[01:05:44.680 --> 01:05:45.680]   - It can only rotate so far, okay, here we go.
[01:05:45.680 --> 01:05:47.680]   - Not that camera, shoot the camera, we're--
[01:05:47.680 --> 01:05:48.680]   - Oh, that camera?
[01:05:48.680 --> 01:05:49.680]   I don't think it can hit that.
[01:05:49.680 --> 01:05:50.680]   Give me the jib.
[01:05:50.680 --> 01:05:51.680]   - Alright, here we go.
[01:05:51.680 --> 01:05:53.680]   - See if she can hit that jib.
[01:05:53.680 --> 01:05:54.680]   - Here we go.
[01:05:54.680 --> 01:05:56.680]   - Okay, here we go.
[01:05:56.680 --> 01:05:58.680]   I think I might need that.
[01:05:58.680 --> 01:06:03.680]   - Up, up, left, left, up, left, down, shoot.
[01:06:03.680 --> 01:06:05.680]   - Up, right there?
[01:06:05.680 --> 01:06:07.680]   - Up, right there.
[01:06:07.680 --> 01:06:09.680]   - Ah.
[01:06:09.680 --> 01:06:10.680]   - Hold it on the jib.
[01:06:10.680 --> 01:06:11.680]   - Alright, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[01:06:11.680 --> 01:06:13.680]   - It jammed, it jammed, hold on, hold on.
[01:06:13.680 --> 01:06:15.680]   - This is exactly what--
[01:06:15.680 --> 01:06:17.680]   - Oh, holy, I think it's in it all the way.
[01:06:17.680 --> 01:06:19.680]   - Okay, we can adjust.
[01:06:19.680 --> 01:06:20.680]   - Just keep that one.
[01:06:20.680 --> 01:06:22.680]   - I need some chip shot.
[01:06:22.680 --> 01:06:23.680]   There's one bad one.
[01:06:23.680 --> 01:06:24.680]   - Oh, that's a bad one.
[01:06:24.680 --> 01:06:25.680]   - Alright, we'll put this on here.
[01:06:25.680 --> 01:06:27.680]   - Yeah, just leave it there and then here.
[01:06:27.680 --> 01:06:29.680]   Okay, we're getting the missiles back.
[01:06:29.680 --> 01:06:30.680]   - Alright, here we go.
[01:06:30.680 --> 01:06:31.680]   - It's easy to load, kids.
[01:06:31.680 --> 01:06:33.680]   - Reload, reload.
[01:06:33.680 --> 01:06:35.680]   - Here we go.
[01:06:35.680 --> 01:06:38.680]   - 40 bucks, I would buy this even just to take it apart
[01:06:38.680 --> 01:06:41.680]   and have a computer controlled servo platform
[01:06:41.680 --> 01:06:42.680]   and an actuator.
[01:06:42.680 --> 01:06:45.680]   - By the way, we've brought the DreamCheeky website down.
[01:06:45.680 --> 01:06:48.680]   Either that or their servo, but the same people will do Apple.
[01:06:48.680 --> 01:06:50.680]   Alright, okay.
[01:06:50.680 --> 01:06:54.680]   Oh yeah, now we put the jib camera, put 33 up
[01:06:54.680 --> 01:06:56.680]   so we can see when we actually hit you.
[01:06:56.680 --> 01:06:59.680]   - I need to just walk into the kill zone, my minion.
[01:06:59.680 --> 01:07:00.680]   That's what you're here for.
[01:07:00.680 --> 01:07:01.680]   - Is that the broken one?
[01:07:01.680 --> 01:07:02.680]   - It's fine.
[01:07:02.680 --> 01:07:05.680]   - Whoa, just a little to the left.
[01:07:05.680 --> 01:07:06.680]   - Alright, I got it.
[01:07:06.680 --> 01:07:07.680]   - Okay, you ready?
[01:07:07.680 --> 01:07:08.680]   - Okay, ready?
[01:07:08.680 --> 01:07:09.680]   - Jib.
[01:07:09.680 --> 01:07:10.680]   - Oh!
[01:07:10.680 --> 01:07:12.680]   - Anyway, congratulations.
[01:07:12.680 --> 01:07:15.680]   You're a human shield for generally some Oleo.
[01:07:15.680 --> 01:07:20.680]   - Anyway, it is so freaking awesome.
[01:07:20.680 --> 01:07:23.680]   - Anyway, I literally, it was just, I literally bought it
[01:07:23.680 --> 01:07:25.680]   because as soon as I saw it, I was like, that's gonna be so awesome.
[01:07:25.680 --> 01:07:28.680]   - Jim Halper is this, I gotta say, a bothered Dwight.
[01:07:28.680 --> 01:07:31.680]   - Yeah, it is a great little, it's a fun little tool.
[01:07:31.680 --> 01:07:32.680]   Kids love it.
[01:07:32.680 --> 01:07:35.680]   - If we could just get the shark in here, we could finally rid
[01:07:35.680 --> 01:07:36.680]   ourselves of that pest.
[01:07:36.680 --> 01:07:38.680]   - Oh, we could get the shark, where's the shark?
[01:07:38.680 --> 01:07:39.680]   - Yeah, exactly.
[01:07:39.680 --> 01:07:42.680]   So anyway, so I'm glad, it is a lot of fun and it works.
[01:07:42.680 --> 01:07:45.680]   And it's got a camera, but I haven't been able to get it to work
[01:07:45.680 --> 01:07:47.680]   correctly on the Mac, on the PC side.
[01:07:47.680 --> 01:07:48.680]   - It's got a camera?
[01:07:48.680 --> 01:07:50.680]   - It's got a little USB camera, so you have a, you actually have a...
[01:07:50.680 --> 01:07:51.680]   - Oh my God!
[01:07:51.680 --> 01:07:53.680]   - With that, you can actually, it has like a little red dot in the center
[01:07:53.680 --> 01:07:56.680]   so you can kind of sight it up and everything else.
[01:07:56.680 --> 01:07:57.680]   - Wow.
[01:07:57.680 --> 01:08:00.680]   - And now you know why I did my pick.
[01:08:00.680 --> 01:08:03.680]   - I'm like completely separate from Alex's.
[01:08:03.680 --> 01:08:05.680]   - I've been looking at retrofitting it with a...
[01:08:05.680 --> 01:08:06.680]   - Call it a cow.
[01:08:06.680 --> 01:08:10.680]   - Yeah, I've been considering retrofitting it with some...
[01:08:10.680 --> 01:08:13.680]   I'm not gonna...
[01:08:13.680 --> 01:08:15.680]   retrofitting it with explosives.
[01:08:15.680 --> 01:08:17.680]   Is that what you said?
[01:08:17.680 --> 01:08:19.680]   - It's not explosives, but you know...
[01:08:19.680 --> 01:08:22.680]   - Dummy, it'd be great just as a motion control time-lapse camera
[01:08:22.680 --> 01:08:24.680]   for something like a GoPro.
[01:08:24.680 --> 01:08:27.680]   If I could take the weight of it, you know, simply program it to simply...
[01:08:27.680 --> 01:08:28.680]   - Shoot a camera.
[01:08:28.680 --> 01:08:32.680]   - Not that I would ever do this, but if you soak something in some, you know,
[01:08:32.680 --> 01:08:34.680]   something like lighter fluid and then put a little flame out in front of it.
[01:08:34.680 --> 01:08:35.680]   - Flaming?
[01:08:35.680 --> 01:08:39.680]   - It would be pretty Roman.
[01:08:39.680 --> 01:08:40.680]   That's all I gotta say.
[01:08:40.680 --> 01:08:42.680]   - It's said Alex Lindsay, not Leo Laporta.
[01:08:42.680 --> 01:08:44.680]   - I would say that, nor do we recommend it.
[01:08:44.680 --> 01:08:46.680]   - We would now recommend that.
[01:08:46.680 --> 01:08:49.680]   - The other thing you could do is put a little contact explosive on the tip.
[01:08:49.680 --> 01:08:50.680]   - If you took...
[01:08:50.680 --> 01:08:51.680]   - Yeah, iodine and...
[01:08:51.680 --> 01:08:53.680]   - Yeah, just make some contact explosive.
[01:08:53.680 --> 01:08:54.680]   - Mm-hmm.
[01:08:54.680 --> 01:08:57.680]   - Put it on the tip and then you'd know when it landed, so you wouldn't lose them.
[01:08:57.680 --> 01:08:58.680]   - Yeah.
[01:08:58.680 --> 01:08:59.680]   - You would need to let it...
[01:08:59.680 --> 01:09:00.680]   - Yeah.
[01:09:00.680 --> 01:09:01.680]   - Um...
[01:09:01.680 --> 01:09:03.680]   - Anybody got a lighter?
[01:09:03.680 --> 01:09:05.680]   All right, so let's...
[01:09:05.680 --> 01:09:06.680]   [laughter]
[01:09:06.680 --> 01:09:12.680]   Let's, you know, there's an interesting debate going on right now about why Apple is down.
[01:09:12.680 --> 01:09:18.680]   There's some thought that perhaps they got hacked, but then there's a number of websites saying no,
[01:09:18.680 --> 01:09:19.680]   Apple didn't get hacked.
[01:09:19.680 --> 01:09:20.680]   It was just traffic.
[01:09:20.680 --> 01:09:24.680]   What's interesting is you don't expect Apple's website to go down on a day like this.
[01:09:24.680 --> 01:09:29.680]   If anybody would throw more bandwidth on a site on an announcement day, it would be Apple.
[01:09:29.680 --> 01:09:34.680]   So it is not a good thing that Apple's website has been up and down.
[01:09:34.680 --> 01:09:36.680]   - Time to upgrade from GeoCities, I think.
[01:09:36.680 --> 01:09:40.680]   - It doesn't seem like the announcement was big enough that would...
[01:09:40.680 --> 01:09:41.680]   You know, that would...
[01:09:41.680 --> 01:09:42.680]   - Why would this...
[01:09:42.680 --> 01:09:44.680]   - It's the right thing you've all over the launch traffic.
[01:09:44.680 --> 01:09:45.680]   - Yeah, I like to...
[01:09:45.680 --> 01:09:47.680]   Oliver Rydenbeck was here from Buying Software.
[01:09:47.680 --> 01:09:53.680]   He had the theory that perhaps as part of the launch of iCloud, they were maybe making some switches
[01:09:53.680 --> 01:09:58.680]   to servers and that was what was going on, but Akamai, I don't know.
[01:09:58.680 --> 01:09:59.680]   - Akamai is totally capable of it.
[01:09:59.680 --> 01:10:01.680]   I cannot imagine.
[01:10:01.680 --> 01:10:02.680]   - You cannot bring them down.
[01:10:02.680 --> 01:10:03.680]   - You could bring them down.
[01:10:03.680 --> 01:10:04.680]   - I don't know if it's possible.
[01:10:04.680 --> 01:10:08.680]   - Yeah, and Gizmodo's reporting no, they weren't brought down and something else was going on.
[01:10:08.680 --> 01:10:11.680]   Apple was not hacked, Siskizmodo.
[01:10:11.680 --> 01:10:15.680]   Of course, we're all a little bit gun shy these days with all the hacking that's been going on
[01:10:15.680 --> 01:10:17.680]   from a little second anonymous.
[01:10:17.680 --> 01:10:20.680]   The internet uses something called...
[01:10:20.680 --> 01:10:23.680]   You know, I can't believe I'm going to read this story from Gizmodo.
[01:10:23.680 --> 01:10:24.680]   - Mm-hmm.
[01:10:24.680 --> 01:10:30.680]   - By the way, the Gizmodo site is also very, very slow right now, so I give up.
[01:10:30.680 --> 01:10:31.680]   - I give up.
[01:10:31.680 --> 01:10:33.680]   - Apple has brought down the internet.
[01:10:33.680 --> 01:10:34.680]   I give up.
[01:10:34.680 --> 01:10:40.680]   - More percent chances at the end of days, though.
[01:10:40.680 --> 01:10:41.680]   - Could be.
[01:10:41.680 --> 01:10:42.680]   - Could be.
[01:10:42.680 --> 01:10:44.680]   - Those horsemen are coming.
[01:10:44.680 --> 01:10:47.680]   The internet uses something that's so slow.
[01:10:47.680 --> 01:10:49.680]   I don't know what's going on.
[01:10:49.680 --> 01:10:50.680]   - Thank you for joining us.
[01:10:50.680 --> 01:10:52.680]   We hope you will come back again.
[01:10:52.680 --> 01:10:57.680]   If you want to see the details of the announcement this morning as they unfolded, we just go to our
[01:10:57.680 --> 01:10:58.680]   Twitch specials feed.
[01:10:58.680 --> 01:11:06.680]   We have a special broadcast with a great crew, including Tom Merritt, Sarah Lane, Andy, and Alex,
[01:11:06.680 --> 01:11:10.680]   as well as Tim from App.
[01:11:10.680 --> 01:11:11.680]   - App advice?
[01:11:11.680 --> 01:11:13.680]   - App advice, thank you.
[01:11:13.680 --> 01:11:14.680]   Sorry, Tim.
[01:11:14.680 --> 01:11:15.680]   Tim Cheetam of App.
[01:11:15.680 --> 01:11:16.680]   Cheetam, right?
[01:11:16.680 --> 01:11:17.680]   Chatham?
[01:11:17.680 --> 01:11:18.680]   Chatham?
[01:11:18.680 --> 01:11:20.680]   - Just go to App advice.com.
[01:11:20.680 --> 01:11:22.680]   They're still up, by the way.
[01:11:22.680 --> 01:11:26.680]   Also, Oliver Bridenback of Buying Software and Jim McDonald of Smile.
[01:11:26.680 --> 01:11:28.680]   That is on our Twitch specials feed.
[01:11:28.680 --> 01:11:30.680]   Thank you for joining us for Mac Break Weekly.
[01:11:30.680 --> 01:11:31.680]   We will be back next Tuesday.
[01:11:31.680 --> 01:11:35.680]   Maybe we'll even know a little bit more about this Siri fella.
[01:11:35.680 --> 01:11:38.680]   Meanwhile, get back to work because break time is over.
