[00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.080]   Hi everyone, welcome back to Macbreak Weekly.
[00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:19.920]   This is Alex sitting in for Leo, who is on jury duty.
[00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.960]   I can't tell you what he's talking about or what
[00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:22.280]   he's in there.
[00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:23.120]   That would be legal.
[00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:25.720]   He's signed up in jail and no one would be here to do the show.
[00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:29.560]   But fortunately, I do have some folks to do the show with.
[00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:31.960]   Leo is the only one on jury duty at the moment.
[00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:35.040]   We've got Andy and Aco coming in from the Chicago Sun Times.
[00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:36.160]   Hey Andy.
[00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:37.600]   Hello Alex.
[00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:40.640]   And Clayton Morris from Fox and Friends and Daddy on board.
[00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:41.640]   Hey Clayton.
[00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.000]   Hey guys, nice to see you.
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:43.840]   Good to see you too.
[00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:50.320]   And there is of course a lot of news in the Apple world here.
[00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:54.440]   We've got Apple fifth most innovative company.
[00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:58.160]   Fifth, which I was kind of surprised by.
[00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:02.000]   I think it's just that you get used to hearing about Apple
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.880]   as the most innovative company and everything else.
[00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:04.640]   And it came in fifth.
[00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:08.240]   Now it did come in front of Google, which is number seven.
[00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:12.320]   Microsoft, which is number I think something like 84.
[00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:14.680]   But it's number one in this list.
[00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:18.080]   And this is on the Forbes list.
[00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:21.720]   Number one is salesforce.com.
[00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:24.160]   Then Amazon, intuitive surgical.
[00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:28.560]   Well, I'm kind of curious what they're so innovative about.
[00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.440]   Tencent Holdings, which is number four.
[00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:32.080]   And then Apple is number five.
[00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:36.640]   So first of all, Clayton, what are these companies in one
[00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:38.960]   through four half that Apple doesn't?
[00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:40.120]   I know that's a good question.
[00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:42.480]   I mean, I think you make these arbitrary lists sometime.
[00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:43.280]   And as you can see--
[00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:45.120]   And you can put like a stock in about it.
[00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:45.440]   Right.
[00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:46.320]   But it is interesting.
[00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:49.720]   And I think Salesforce is an interesting point on this,
[00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:50.800]   being number one here.
[00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:52.680]   And I think what's interesting about Salesforce
[00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:55.800]   and what they're doing is they're doing a lot in the mobile space.
[00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:59.400]   And actually, they're relying largely on iPads to do it
[00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:01.240]   across the board for Salesforce.
[00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:03.160]   Many companies are building their infrastructure
[00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:04.160]   on the back of Salesforce.
[00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:07.040]   But my wife writing a piece for Forbes not too long ago
[00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:09.440]   actually did quite a bit of research on the Salesforce
[00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:10.000]   side of things.
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.960]   And interestingly, the tablets that they're using are iPads.
[00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:16.480]   And the infrastructure-- put it this way.
[00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:19.120]   This is really fascinating to me, is that think
[00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:21.360]   of a hip replacement company.
[00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:24.040]   Because God knows, I'll probably need one one day.
[00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:26.320]   You have these Salesmen all across the world
[00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:28.080]   who need to have updated information
[00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:31.000]   about different parts, different joints, different sockets
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.920]   that they can go out and sell to different doctors.
[00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:36.520]   But every country has different statistics.
[00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:38.560]   Every country has different laws about when
[00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:42.240]   in which these hip sockets might be available.
[00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:43.760]   Maybe in the United States, there
[00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:47.360]   has to be a whole level of testing by the FDA or whomever
[00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:48.240]   to approve these things.
[00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:50.640]   Iceland, maybe they can just push it on through.
[00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:52.600]   Salesforce, these Salesmen, are able to go out
[00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:53.280]   to these doctors.
[00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:55.680]   And that morning, just like receiving an issue of the daily
[00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:58.520]   that morning, they're able to see on their iPads
[00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:00.840]   the updated parts information.
[00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:03.880]   So if they had a meeting with an individual that afternoon--
[00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:04.380]   Right.
[00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:06.200]   And they're going to go to that meeting and boom,
[00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:06.680]   it's right there.
[00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:08.640]   Oh, I can sell you that hip replacement socket
[00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:09.920]   because it was approved overnight.
[00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:11.080]   Well, and that's their basic CRM.
[00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:12.880]   And I'm not going to get too much further into it.
[00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:15.560]   As just as a journalistically, I mean
[00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:19.680]   to say that Salesforce is one of my company's largest clients.
[00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:21.480]   So I don't want to dig into it too deeply.
[00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:22.840]   But one of the things they are doing
[00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:24.920]   is allowing people to program on the cloud.
[00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:27.040]   For instance, we manage most of our company inside
[00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:28.520]   of their platform.
[00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:30.800]   Andy, what do these companies have
[00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:32.800]   that is making them more innovative?
[00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:36.160]   Or what does Apple have that gets it to number five?
[00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:38.840]   I think when you take a look at the list a second time,
[00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:41.800]   it's not that surprising that Apple is number five.
[00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:43.400]   And all these companies that other people would not
[00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:47.600]   have come up with at the top of their tongues or hired them.
[00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:48.960]   Because all these other companies,
[00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:50.240]   they have a certain amount of freedom
[00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:52.200]   that companies like Google and Apple don't do.
[00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:54.080]   They don't have to deal with millions and millions
[00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:55.360]   and millions of users.
[00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:58.040]   They have to deal with tens of thousands of customers.
[00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:00.800]   And also, there is not sort of an abstract relationship
[00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:03.000]   between the relationship between their customers
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:04.160]   and their profitability.
[00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:06.440]   So if someone comes in saying, we
[00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:07.960]   are only one of your installations,
[00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:10.000]   but it would make us so happy right now
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:11.400]   and make our lives so much better
[00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:12.760]   if you could add this one feature
[00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:15.520]   or make this device you've built or the software you've built,
[00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:18.200]   work with us one system that we absolutely have to deal with,
[00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:21.040]   their ability to scramble a team, do a black box job
[00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:23.240]   and actually get that working very, very quickly.
[00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:25.520]   And in doing so, stumble into a way that,
[00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:27.200]   wow, that is actually a better way to do it.
[00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:29.960]   I can't believe we didn't figure out that for ourselves.
[00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:34.200]   That's an agility that a company like Apple doesn't have.
[00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:37.680]   Although, it's also not surprising that Amazon
[00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:39.440]   is what number four was it?
[00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:41.320]   - Amazon is number two.
[00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:42.320]   - Number two.
[00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:43.160]   - Number two.
[00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:48.160]   - Yeah, I've really seen Amazon as Apple's greatest competitor
[00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:52.760]   for Hearts and Minds Consumer Innovation
[00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:55.840]   because they've just really pulled off
[00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:57.880]   a series of quiet revolutions
[00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:02.600]   where they're letting Google and Apple do the big stage,
[00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:04.880]   black turtleneck, tent your fingers
[00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:07.200]   and talk to the camera sort of presentations.
[00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:08.280]   Amazon's a company that says,
[00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:09.880]   oh, yeah, well, we decided to be kind of cool
[00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:11.840]   if all the movies you bought was available to you in the cloud.
[00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:13.000]   So we did that here.
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.120]   - And I think that one thing that we can see
[00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:18.320]   that is very common among all of these
[00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:21.800]   is that you do have companies who have proven
[00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:24.160]   that they can redefine themselves over and over and over
[00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:25.000]   and over again.
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:26.640]   When you look at Salesforce, they started off with CRM.
[00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:29.480]   They now do cloud computing, social enterprise.
[00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:30.640]   There's a whole lot of things that they're doing
[00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:34.000]   that are completely different than what they started doing.
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.880]   Amazon, when Amazon moved into electronics,
[00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:37.720]   when they started going,
[00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:42.080]   I'm, we're gonna sell things other than books.
[00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:43.640]   I thought they were absolutely insane.
[00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:45.320]   I was like, this is where I buy all my books.
[00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:46.760]   I don't want them to make it more complicated.
[00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:48.560]   They're gonna ruin everything.
[00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:51.680]   By going off and ruining this perfect experience
[00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:52.520]   that I have.
[00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:55.680]   And now, the first place I go to make it to point out
[00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:57.520]   whether I can buy something is Amazon
[00:06:57.520 --> 00:06:59.360]   because I don't wanna think about it.
[00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:00.280]   I don't wanna get in the car.
[00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:02.240]   I don't wanna deal with anybody else's login.
[00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:03.800]   I know that it's gonna show up.
[00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:05.640]   And in the same way, Apple,
[00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:07.680]   I'm moving to iPhone from computers.
[00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:10.480]   And Google moving from search
[00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:11.840]   to all the other things that they're doing.
[00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:13.640]   So I think that to be up here,
[00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:15.800]   it seems like you need to be able to continue
[00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:18.360]   to redefine that market.
[00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:20.640]   And I have noticed how many of them are cloud-based.
[00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:22.520]   I mean, how many of them are something that,
[00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:23.840]   I think one of the things that's hard for Apple
[00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:25.520]   is that when you're making hardware,
[00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:28.200]   it's hard to be innovative.
[00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:29.040]   - That's a great point.
[00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:30.800]   And remember, this list was written by Forbes,
[00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:34.720]   Financial Magazine that is looking at the technicals
[00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:36.880]   and not necessarily the fundamentals of a company,
[00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:38.360]   but looking back over the history of Apple,
[00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:39.600]   at least over the last 10 years,
[00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:40.880]   to see the innovation speed.
[00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:42.440]   I mean, constantly innovating,
[00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:44.760]   constantly pushing the envelope on innovation.
[00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:47.920]   But then I'm also struck by how far down Microsoft is
[00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:49.640]   on the list, 86th.
[00:07:49.640 --> 00:07:50.920]   And you talk about, you know,
[00:07:50.920 --> 00:07:53.520]   not to get too far bogged down in buying stocks,
[00:07:53.520 --> 00:07:55.760]   but you look at the technicals of a company,
[00:07:55.760 --> 00:07:57.640]   which is sort of future predicting
[00:07:57.640 --> 00:07:59.120]   of where that company is gonna go.
[00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:01.440]   And you anticipate that Apple will have
[00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:04.680]   some exciting releases coming down the pike in the fall.
[00:08:04.680 --> 00:08:09.680]   Next year, 2012, 2013, what is Microsoft?
[00:08:09.680 --> 00:08:11.600]   Where is their innovation space coming?
[00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:14.000]   And that's probably why they're so far down on this list.
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.720]   - Yeah, well, let's let's tile this together.
[00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:17.920]   One of the great things Amazon does
[00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:19.720]   is it allows you to look at every single
[00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:21.360]   chargeable shaver on the market
[00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:24.160]   and then sigh, shake your heads, okay, look,
[00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:26.280]   whatever the second cheapest one is,
[00:08:26.280 --> 00:08:27.680]   it's been the top five of sales,
[00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:29.960]   that's the one I'm getting, I'm done.
[00:08:29.960 --> 00:08:32.160]   That's my new shaver just arrived today.
[00:08:32.160 --> 00:08:33.320]   That's sweet.
[00:08:33.320 --> 00:08:36.920]   - Yeah, after 10 years, I finally switched my shaver.
[00:08:36.920 --> 00:08:39.000]   And it really, this is really seriously
[00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:39.880]   what I'm thinking about right now,
[00:08:39.880 --> 00:08:42.600]   because I'm looking at these listings on Saturday
[00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:47.200]   saying, for heaven's sake, there is a $200 shaver
[00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:51.240]   on the market that shaves, you know, your face.
[00:08:51.240 --> 00:08:53.040]   And it doesn't, it's not a hover shaver.
[00:08:53.040 --> 00:08:54.360]   - And let me tell you, Andy.
[00:08:54.360 --> 00:08:57.240]   - And I can tell you from experience, it's awesome.
[00:08:57.240 --> 00:09:00.400]   - Okay, I'm sure it is, and I'm sure that,
[00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:05.400]   I'm sure that there are women out there
[00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:10.200]   who would much rather kiss your one mic run closer shave
[00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:12.440]   than my perfectly good shave
[00:09:12.440 --> 00:09:15.720]   that of a guy who still has $170 to spend
[00:09:15.720 --> 00:09:17.340]   on a Broadway show.
[00:09:17.340 --> 00:09:18.800]   - Exactly, you're going out to dinner.
[00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:20.960]   You're taking the lady out to dinner, Alex is like,
[00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:23.280]   yep, it has nothing to do with that at all.
[00:09:23.280 --> 00:09:24.360]   It has everything else.
[00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:26.480]   Alex is ordering saying, I will have the chicken case
[00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:28.320]   at the end, and the lady will have an item of equal
[00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:30.040]   or lesser value.
[00:09:30.040 --> 00:09:31.960]   - You know, it has to do with how often you shave.
[00:09:31.960 --> 00:09:34.240]   If you only shave once a week for the show,
[00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:35.880]   see then you need something that can really, you know,
[00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:37.560]   cut through the weeds, that's all I'm saying.
[00:09:37.560 --> 00:09:39.920]   So anyway, that's the real issue.
[00:09:39.920 --> 00:09:44.400]   - At a $12 wall, but my point is that,
[00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:48.000]   I'm not sure that I went through the microphone.
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.440]   - Is all that hurt about this list,
[00:09:50.440 --> 00:09:53.640]   because they still have about 90% of their market.
[00:09:53.640 --> 00:09:55.240]   They're still making money hand over fist.
[00:09:55.240 --> 00:09:57.640]   It's not dramatic, but they're still essentially
[00:09:57.640 --> 00:09:59.880]   doing things that are, make cosmos and seed
[00:09:59.880 --> 00:10:01.640]   as a company, and when you get down to it,
[00:10:01.640 --> 00:10:04.520]   there are a great many people that don't really require
[00:10:04.520 --> 00:10:06.680]   an innovative shaver, they just wanna shave.
[00:10:06.680 --> 00:10:08.480]   That's the sort of stuff that Microsoft makes.
[00:10:08.480 --> 00:10:10.160]   So always gonna be a market for that.
[00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:12.800]   And that's, I think they're, at this point,
[00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:16.080]   they've sort of let go of the idea that they are going
[00:10:16.080 --> 00:10:18.800]   to be the superhero saviors that redefine an industry,
[00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:20.200]   and they're just simply gonna be happy
[00:10:20.200 --> 00:10:21.520]   about looking at those numbers.
[00:10:21.520 --> 00:10:22.520]   - I don't think they're happy with that.
[00:10:22.520 --> 00:10:24.720]   I think that they want to be in the top 10.
[00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:25.680]   They wanna be in the top 20.
[00:10:25.680 --> 00:10:26.720]   I think that they just can't find,
[00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:27.880]   figure out a way to get back there.
[00:10:27.880 --> 00:10:29.360]   - Well, no, I think now,
[00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:30.400]   that's the utility though.
[00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:33.360]   - Are they, to Andy's point, are they now a utility company?
[00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:36.000]   We don't need them to innovate, we just need the lights on.
[00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:37.920]   - Well, there's a couple of dimensions to that.
[00:10:37.920 --> 00:10:42.520]   One is that they're, all the innovative things that they do,
[00:10:42.520 --> 00:10:44.840]   they don't have control over their market right now.
[00:10:44.840 --> 00:10:47.120]   Little over half of all Windows installations
[00:10:47.120 --> 00:10:50.160]   are still Windows XP, and Apple, excuse me,
[00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:53.920]   and Microsoft cannot do anything to get people to upgrade,
[00:10:53.920 --> 00:10:54.760]   except for many people.
[00:10:54.760 --> 00:10:55.920]   - Well, but if they were Apple, if it was Apple,
[00:10:55.920 --> 00:10:57.920]   Apple would just say, well, you can't run
[00:10:57.920 --> 00:11:00.800]   any new applications on Windows XP.
[00:11:00.800 --> 00:11:02.280]   Like they would just, you know,
[00:11:02.280 --> 00:11:04.320]   that's how Apple would move everybody forward,
[00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:05.440]   is we're gonna drop the price,
[00:11:05.440 --> 00:11:06.720]   and then we're gonna say that nothing else.
[00:11:06.720 --> 00:11:07.920]   Oh, wait, they just did that, right?
[00:11:07.920 --> 00:11:09.680]   - And realize that's only something they were able to do
[00:11:09.680 --> 00:11:12.320]   starting this year, because they've always had control
[00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:15.000]   over the hardware, and now they also have
[00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.440]   presumptive control over the app market space.
[00:11:17.440 --> 00:11:20.200]   They're doing cool things with this in September,
[00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:21.960]   I think is the deadline that they've announced
[00:11:21.960 --> 00:11:24.640]   to developers saying that if you're writing Lion Apps,
[00:11:24.640 --> 00:11:27.600]   it has to be Sandbox, you have to have Sandbox apps
[00:11:27.600 --> 00:11:30.280]   ready by September, or else we're not gonna prove you anymore.
[00:11:30.280 --> 00:11:31.200]   That's something they can do.
[00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:32.680]   Microsoft does not have that ability,
[00:11:32.680 --> 00:11:37.440]   because they're dealing with what is the biggest advantage
[00:11:37.440 --> 00:11:39.120]   that Windows still has for the users,
[00:11:39.120 --> 00:11:41.880]   dozens and dozens of highly competitive companies
[00:11:41.880 --> 00:11:44.720]   making better and better and cheaper and cheaper hardware.
[00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:46.760]   - Yeah, but even from the enterprise space, right?
[00:11:46.760 --> 00:11:49.240]   When I go to the ATM at whatever Bank of America,
[00:11:49.240 --> 00:11:51.320]   you know, it's running Microsoft,
[00:11:51.320 --> 00:11:53.960]   the car that I drive is powered by Microsoft.
[00:11:53.960 --> 00:11:56.440]   So from an enterprise standpoint,
[00:11:56.440 --> 00:11:58.720]   it seems like Microsoft has the dominance there.
[00:11:58.720 --> 00:11:59.960]   It's not as sexy, perhaps.
[00:11:59.960 --> 00:12:02.720]   It's not as attractive a market, one that shifts so much,
[00:12:02.720 --> 00:12:06.840]   but hey, the lights are on, we're making money for now.
[00:12:06.840 --> 00:12:10.240]   - So speaking of, I mean, when I say for an advocate,
[00:12:10.240 --> 00:12:12.800]   you're advocating nationalizing Microsoft
[00:12:12.800 --> 00:12:16.000]   as a national resource that's way too important
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:17.800]   to be left in the hands of private enterprise.
[00:12:17.800 --> 00:12:18.640]   - Right, exactly.
[00:12:18.640 --> 00:12:21.080]   - I think I've always, I haven't thought of Clayton
[00:12:21.080 --> 00:12:23.680]   as a real nationalization kind of guy, you know,
[00:12:23.680 --> 00:12:26.160]   he's always pushing that forward.
[00:12:26.160 --> 00:12:27.000]   - Exactly.
[00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:28.480]   (laughs)
[00:12:28.480 --> 00:12:33.520]   - So the coming up as far as innovation, iOS 5
[00:12:33.520 --> 00:12:36.240]   is now been released.
[00:12:36.240 --> 00:12:40.200]   It looks like there might be multiple iCloud logins,
[00:12:40.200 --> 00:12:44.120]   Andy, have you seen any rumors about that?
[00:12:44.120 --> 00:12:45.240]   - I've been doing a lot of reading
[00:12:45.240 --> 00:12:49.120]   about what's been posted on the various sites about it.
[00:12:49.120 --> 00:12:52.120]   And the general take that's available to the public
[00:12:52.120 --> 00:12:55.880]   about iOS 5 is that this latest beta seems to be mostly
[00:12:55.880 --> 00:13:00.760]   about taking it to the next step where now iCloud services
[00:13:00.760 --> 00:13:02.000]   can now be tested.
[00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:04.120]   And that's jobs with other things that have been published
[00:13:04.120 --> 00:13:06.920]   on the unofficial Apple web log and Apple insider
[00:13:06.920 --> 00:13:10.400]   and the rest about how now if you're a developer
[00:13:10.400 --> 00:13:13.160]   and you have to have a pile of different betas
[00:13:13.160 --> 00:13:15.280]   across multiple platforms, you even get access
[00:13:15.280 --> 00:13:17.200]   to iCloud at this point.
[00:13:17.200 --> 00:13:18.600]   Now when you log into iCloud and say,
[00:13:18.600 --> 00:13:19.760]   okay, do you wanna sync this?
[00:13:19.760 --> 00:13:20.880]   Do you not wanna sync that?
[00:13:20.880 --> 00:13:21.840]   Do you have this sort of app?
[00:13:21.840 --> 00:13:23.640]   Do you not have that sort of app?
[00:13:23.640 --> 00:13:25.480]   So we're definitely on a rocket sled
[00:13:25.480 --> 00:13:26.720]   towards the September release,
[00:13:26.720 --> 00:13:29.240]   but there's still a lot of question, I think,
[00:13:29.240 --> 00:13:31.840]   again, based on what's available to the public right now
[00:13:31.840 --> 00:13:35.080]   about how much is gonna make it into the final release
[00:13:35.080 --> 00:13:36.560]   and how much is just gonna be,
[00:13:36.560 --> 00:13:39.640]   let's roll back the tape,
[00:13:39.640 --> 00:13:43.040]   look at all the bullet points that we promised at WWDC,
[00:13:43.040 --> 00:13:44.360]   make sure we cover those things.
[00:13:44.360 --> 00:13:47.400]   And when we, well, maybe we should have to table
[00:13:47.400 --> 00:13:50.520]   the hover pad concept until at least 2012.
[00:13:50.520 --> 00:13:53.160]   - Do we think that now it looks like in iOS 5,
[00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:55.360]   it does look like they have a nuance
[00:13:55.360 --> 00:13:57.520]   or something that would lead us to believe
[00:13:57.520 --> 00:13:58.960]   that Apple has been,
[00:13:58.960 --> 00:14:01.360]   the nuance partnership is a bearing fruit.
[00:14:01.360 --> 00:14:04.800]   Clayton, how big of a deal do you think
[00:14:04.800 --> 00:14:08.560]   this is, that the speech recognition is for iOS 5?
[00:14:08.560 --> 00:14:10.400]   - Yeah, I think it's a big deal.
[00:14:10.400 --> 00:14:13.360]   I think it's obvious that all the other platforms have it,
[00:14:13.360 --> 00:14:15.480]   right, Windows Phone has it, Android has it,
[00:14:15.480 --> 00:14:16.880]   so it's catch up here,
[00:14:16.880 --> 00:14:18.920]   but it's catch up and beat, I think,
[00:14:18.920 --> 00:14:20.280]   because I think with nuance,
[00:14:20.280 --> 00:14:23.160]   you change the, I think you change the game.
[00:14:23.160 --> 00:14:25.440]   Certainly Google has a voice capability
[00:14:25.440 --> 00:14:27.240]   and they've been researching it and spending years
[00:14:27.240 --> 00:14:28.880]   using Google Voice and--
[00:14:28.880 --> 00:14:31.680]   - The new one has been spending decades doing it, right?
[00:14:31.680 --> 00:14:33.600]   - Right, exactly, so nuance is the one,
[00:14:33.600 --> 00:14:35.680]   when I tweeted this earlier in the week,
[00:14:35.680 --> 00:14:37.280]   people said, how big deal Windows Phone has it?
[00:14:37.280 --> 00:14:38.800]   Then I said, do they have nuance?
[00:14:38.800 --> 00:14:39.640]   - Right.
[00:14:39.640 --> 00:14:40.880]   - Because do they have the infrastructure?
[00:14:40.880 --> 00:14:42.280]   I mean, you've been using it for years, right?
[00:14:42.280 --> 00:14:43.120]   - I think I think--
[00:14:43.120 --> 00:14:45.000]   - I think it's Dragon Dictate on my desktop all the time.
[00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:48.440]   - I think I've been using Dragon since it was on the PC
[00:14:48.440 --> 00:14:49.280]   12 years ago.
[00:14:49.280 --> 00:14:51.080]   I mean, you know, and it's been around even longer than that.
[00:14:51.080 --> 00:14:54.280]   So I mean, I think that is the standard when it comes to this.
[00:14:54.280 --> 00:14:55.720]   And building up that library
[00:14:55.720 --> 00:14:58.280]   and building up all that test, you know, work,
[00:14:58.280 --> 00:15:00.040]   is not something, I think that I think Apple
[00:15:00.040 --> 00:15:01.920]   tried to do it for a while.
[00:15:01.920 --> 00:15:05.440]   They did definitely experiment with speech recognition,
[00:15:05.440 --> 00:15:09.360]   but I think that nuance is definitely the solution.
[00:15:09.360 --> 00:15:10.440]   - And it's a big deal.
[00:15:10.440 --> 00:15:12.760]   I mean, think about our lifestyles, right?
[00:15:12.760 --> 00:15:15.360]   And think about how much we are mobile.
[00:15:15.360 --> 00:15:18.440]   And I'm taking walks all the time with my headset on
[00:15:18.440 --> 00:15:19.520]   and listening to music.
[00:15:19.520 --> 00:15:21.880]   And if I just wanted to send someone a quick email
[00:15:21.880 --> 00:15:24.600]   to be able to do that with voice recognition
[00:15:24.600 --> 00:15:28.280]   and actually use speech to text, but doing it well,
[00:15:28.280 --> 00:15:29.520]   where I'm not having to auto correct
[00:15:29.520 --> 00:15:31.360]   and go back and correct 80 different words
[00:15:31.360 --> 00:15:32.520]   and fix all these kinds.
[00:15:32.520 --> 00:15:34.560]   Then I'd much rather just sit down and type out an email.
[00:15:34.560 --> 00:15:35.840]   - Well, and they've been testing it for a while.
[00:15:35.840 --> 00:15:37.840]   You know, it's been one of those things that we've--
[00:15:37.840 --> 00:15:39.680]   Do you have the-- have you been using it all,
[00:15:39.680 --> 00:15:42.160]   the Dragon software that was for the iPhone?
[00:15:42.160 --> 00:15:43.520]   - Oh, yeah, and I use that all the time.
[00:15:43.520 --> 00:15:46.000]   So, you know, I think where you have like a 30 second window
[00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:46.840]   or a certain amount of time.
[00:15:46.840 --> 00:15:48.640]   And it's surprisingly accurate.
[00:15:48.640 --> 00:15:50.000]   - Yeah. - It does a great job.
[00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:51.280]   And it's certainly with the iPhone 4
[00:15:51.280 --> 00:15:52.920]   when you've got the dual microphones.
[00:15:52.920 --> 00:15:54.160]   And so you have some of the noise canceling.
[00:15:54.160 --> 00:15:57.000]   It works really well in the current version in iPhone 4.
[00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:59.120]   So, yeah, they've already had the app out there.
[00:15:59.120 --> 00:16:01.640]   They've already been testing it for three years now.
[00:16:01.640 --> 00:16:03.360]   - Right. Andy, what do you think of the--
[00:16:03.360 --> 00:16:04.840]   Do you think people are gonna use it?
[00:16:04.840 --> 00:16:05.680]   Or do you think people-- - Yeah.
[00:16:05.680 --> 00:16:07.000]   - Is this something that's gonna be really
[00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:10.720]   part of everybody's daily input?
[00:16:10.720 --> 00:16:14.000]   - This is an area where Apple really has to play catch up
[00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:16.160]   and exceed as Clayton is talking about.
[00:16:16.160 --> 00:16:20.240]   The voice to text, voice input experience on an Android phone,
[00:16:20.240 --> 00:16:22.680]   using the latest software is super-lative.
[00:16:22.680 --> 00:16:24.800]   It works exactly the way a consumer would like
[00:16:24.800 --> 00:16:27.240]   this sort of stuff to work, especially,
[00:16:27.240 --> 00:16:29.960]   and this is one of the few cases in which the dedicated
[00:16:29.960 --> 00:16:32.280]   search button, the dedicated buttons on the bottom
[00:16:32.280 --> 00:16:34.200]   of Android phones actually work out.
[00:16:34.200 --> 00:16:37.360]   Because if you have, it's, I really think that Android phone
[00:16:37.360 --> 00:16:41.280]   is the only phone that's so easy to operate via speech
[00:16:41.280 --> 00:16:43.280]   that you can't actually operate it while driving
[00:16:43.280 --> 00:16:44.680]   without being distracted.
[00:16:44.680 --> 00:16:47.720]   Because just like, I think nothing of reaching over to
[00:16:47.720 --> 00:16:52.720]   the iPhone and my car dock, not take my eyes off the road,
[00:16:52.720 --> 00:16:55.640]   holding on the home button and say call,
[00:16:55.640 --> 00:16:58.600]   Igor Stravinsky via Google Voice,
[00:16:58.600 --> 00:17:01.280]   and I'm not thinking I'm gonna be distracted.
[00:17:01.280 --> 00:17:02.800]   With Google Voice, you could simply say,
[00:17:02.800 --> 00:17:05.840]   you simply hold, you know, reach for the search button
[00:17:05.840 --> 00:17:07.720]   without even looking, hold it down, you're the,
[00:17:07.720 --> 00:17:11.600]   you say, navigate to Mexican restaurant,
[00:17:11.600 --> 00:17:13.800]   and it will say back, here is a Mexican restaurant
[00:17:13.800 --> 00:17:15.280]   that's nearby.
[00:17:15.280 --> 00:17:17.440]   Now, can you tap one button and it simply finds it?
[00:17:17.440 --> 00:17:22.240]   And you think that this nuance integration is gonna work
[00:17:22.240 --> 00:17:24.560]   as well as what Android's doing?
[00:17:24.560 --> 00:17:25.400]   Yes and no.
[00:17:25.400 --> 00:17:28.960]   Another advantage that Google has with their implementation
[00:17:28.960 --> 00:17:32.800]   is that they include so much really killer stuff
[00:17:32.800 --> 00:17:34.040]   with the basic install.
[00:17:34.040 --> 00:17:38.440]   Google Maps navigation is as good as almost any
[00:17:38.440 --> 00:17:40.240]   commercial navigation app you can get,
[00:17:40.240 --> 00:17:42.040]   and it is hard wired for Google Voice
[00:17:42.040 --> 00:17:44.240]   and it works really, really well.
[00:17:44.240 --> 00:17:45.080]   If--
[00:17:45.080 --> 00:17:46.160]   Except that it's integration.
[00:17:46.160 --> 00:17:51.080]   If the integration of nuance is that it's just an alternative
[00:17:51.080 --> 00:17:53.440]   to the keyboard where I will still have to,
[00:17:53.440 --> 00:17:56.440]   if I still have to, if I'm using a navigation app,
[00:17:56.440 --> 00:17:57.480]   a third party navigation app,
[00:17:57.480 --> 00:18:00.120]   I'll still have to sort of like pull it in the parking lot,
[00:18:00.120 --> 00:18:04.200]   tap a field, say 1313 mockingbird drive,
[00:18:04.200 --> 00:18:07.120]   then tap another one, Medfield tap,
[00:18:07.120 --> 00:18:09.040]   Massachusetts tap.
[00:18:09.040 --> 00:18:11.200]   That's, you know, I can type stuff like that.
[00:18:11.200 --> 00:18:13.720]   So if Apple has an emphatic way to make sure
[00:18:13.720 --> 00:18:16.200]   that it's easy for developers to make anything
[00:18:16.200 --> 00:18:18.160]   with voice enabled, they'll be good.
[00:18:18.160 --> 00:18:19.760]   If it's just an alternative to the keyboard,
[00:18:19.760 --> 00:18:20.920]   it's okay, but not great.
[00:18:20.920 --> 00:18:22.680]   But, and I think that one of the problems,
[00:18:22.680 --> 00:18:24.520]   and I'm kind of curious to see how they handle it
[00:18:24.520 --> 00:18:27.520]   in iOS 5, is that, you know, Google says,
[00:18:27.520 --> 00:18:29.080]   of course, you know, they're mapping software
[00:18:29.080 --> 00:18:29.920]   and everything else,
[00:18:29.920 --> 00:18:32.200]   and I believe all of their voice recognition is cloud-based.
[00:18:32.200 --> 00:18:33.920]   So when you're saying something is going out
[00:18:33.920 --> 00:18:36.280]   to the cloud and back, well, I had a little trip
[00:18:36.280 --> 00:18:37.840]   on Sunday up the one, you know,
[00:18:37.840 --> 00:18:40.240]   driving up with my daughter up the one,
[00:18:40.240 --> 00:18:42.600]   and yeah, there's not a lot of self coverage
[00:18:42.600 --> 00:18:46.360]   in north of, north of Petaluma on the one,
[00:18:46.360 --> 00:18:47.840]   and I had to go back, I was really glad
[00:18:47.840 --> 00:18:49.200]   that I had Tom Tom on my iPhone,
[00:18:49.200 --> 00:18:51.800]   because I was like, okay, I don't know where to go now.
[00:18:51.800 --> 00:18:52.800]   (laughs)
[00:18:52.800 --> 00:18:54.400]   And I kind of had gone up thinking,
[00:18:54.400 --> 00:18:55.240]   you know, it'll be fine,
[00:18:55.240 --> 00:18:57.480]   and suddenly realize that Google Maps was not
[00:18:57.480 --> 00:18:59.600]   particularly useful, you know,
[00:18:59.600 --> 00:19:00.680]   once you get north of Jenner.
[00:19:00.680 --> 00:19:01.680]   So--
[00:19:01.680 --> 00:19:03.120]   - Well, it does work really, really well,
[00:19:03.120 --> 00:19:04.160]   when it does, when you do have,
[00:19:04.160 --> 00:19:05.480]   so to Andy's point,
[00:19:05.480 --> 00:19:07.640]   I mean, it's, you know, navigate to,
[00:19:07.640 --> 00:19:10.080]   to Eagle or Stravinc's house,
[00:19:10.080 --> 00:19:11.800]   I don't want to watch him do a ballet,
[00:19:11.800 --> 00:19:14.200]   you know, and boom, it knows right where,
[00:19:14.200 --> 00:19:16.080]   based on your contacts, it's going right there,
[00:19:16.080 --> 00:19:17.800]   and there's very little latency at all,
[00:19:17.800 --> 00:19:18.840]   at least in my experience.
[00:19:18.840 --> 00:19:19.680]   - Yeah, yeah, I know.
[00:19:19.680 --> 00:19:21.520]   - Also, you think about the situations
[00:19:21.520 --> 00:19:23.000]   of which you use that sort of thing,
[00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:25.720]   where realize that the penalty for not having,
[00:19:25.720 --> 00:19:26.920]   if it is cloud-based,
[00:19:26.920 --> 00:19:28.480]   but it does require a connection to the internet
[00:19:28.480 --> 00:19:30.280]   in order to get the processing work,
[00:19:30.280 --> 00:19:32.880]   the penalty for not having that,
[00:19:32.880 --> 00:19:35.800]   having access to the internet is that you actually
[00:19:35.800 --> 00:19:37.240]   type things on a keyboard.
[00:19:37.240 --> 00:19:39.000]   So it's not a case of, okay, well,
[00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:41.240]   I'm absolutely screwed because I can't give this phone
[00:19:41.240 --> 00:19:43.320]   command unless I've got-- - I can't go anywhere.
[00:19:43.320 --> 00:19:44.520]   - Right, yeah, absolutely.
[00:19:44.520 --> 00:19:47.120]   - Also, that whole point of being in Vermont
[00:19:47.120 --> 00:19:50.920]   is cutting off, not having access to anything,
[00:19:50.920 --> 00:19:53.200]   not using touch-tone telephones.
[00:19:53.200 --> 00:19:56.040]   - I just needed, well, and I do admit that it's a little geeky
[00:19:56.040 --> 00:19:57.440]   'cause, you know, with my daughter,
[00:19:57.440 --> 00:19:58.520]   both of us have iPhones,
[00:19:58.520 --> 00:20:00.560]   and so the thing is, is that we get to the restaurant
[00:20:00.560 --> 00:20:02.360]   and we sat down and, you know,
[00:20:02.360 --> 00:20:03.760]   a couple seconds later, both of us are kind of,
[00:20:03.760 --> 00:20:06.040]   she's face-booking, and I'm, you know,
[00:20:06.040 --> 00:20:06.880]   text-master talking about it.
[00:20:06.880 --> 00:20:07.720]   - And I got, we have nothing else to talk about.
[00:20:07.720 --> 00:20:09.960]   - We catch some of the critter in the soup.
[00:20:09.960 --> 00:20:12.600]   - It's actually for-- - Little bit of cow.
[00:20:12.600 --> 00:20:14.760]   - We talk most of the time, but I just noticed
[00:20:14.760 --> 00:20:16.360]   that there was a moment there where we had to,
[00:20:16.360 --> 00:20:18.160]   like, before we started talking really quickly--
[00:20:18.160 --> 00:20:20.080]   - My Facebook photos.
[00:20:20.080 --> 00:20:21.160]   - Yeah, well, I was just like, I just,
[00:20:21.160 --> 00:20:22.400]   we just, before we started talking, we were like,
[00:20:22.400 --> 00:20:23.240]   okay, we'll catch up on this.
[00:20:23.240 --> 00:20:24.880]   Okay, Kayden, and now we're back to whatever we were doing.
[00:20:24.880 --> 00:20:26.520]   It was a very odd moment.
[00:20:26.520 --> 00:20:28.320]   It was a little bit of a cats in the cradle.
[00:20:28.320 --> 00:20:31.880]   I'm gonna-- - It really will change everything.
[00:20:31.880 --> 00:20:33.560]   I find myself that I now actually,
[00:20:33.560 --> 00:20:36.040]   even when I'm just, like, sitting in my office,
[00:20:36.040 --> 00:20:38.360]   styling the phone, I'm more likely just to hold
[00:20:38.360 --> 00:20:41.040]   down the home button and say, call--
[00:20:41.040 --> 00:20:41.880]   - Yeah.
[00:20:41.880 --> 00:20:42.720]   - Shfinkle.
[00:20:42.720 --> 00:20:46.560]   - I keep on trying to make the current Apple version work,
[00:20:46.560 --> 00:20:47.920]   but as we've talked about in the past,
[00:20:47.920 --> 00:20:48.760]   it hasn't been totally--
[00:20:48.760 --> 00:20:51.360]   - And the S's and Andy's contact lists are amazing.
[00:20:51.360 --> 00:20:53.880]   Shrinkle and Stravinsky.
[00:20:53.880 --> 00:20:54.720]   - I just finkled.
[00:20:54.720 --> 00:20:56.360]   You don't know if I was finkled is?
[00:20:56.360 --> 00:20:58.120]   - Oh, I know who five is finkled is.
[00:20:58.120 --> 00:20:59.440]   - Oh, I thought you said-- - And which finkled?
[00:20:59.440 --> 00:21:00.280]   - Shfinkled.
[00:21:00.280 --> 00:21:01.960]   - Now, I also-- - I'll come in with it.
[00:21:01.960 --> 00:21:03.800]   - Right now, and tell him that--
[00:21:04.840 --> 00:21:06.640]   - You guys have love, Mr. Clayton.
[00:21:06.640 --> 00:21:09.240]   - Now, also the--
[00:21:09.240 --> 00:21:10.200]   I'm just gonna cut that one off,
[00:21:10.200 --> 00:21:11.600]   'cause I have no idea what you guys are talking about.
[00:21:11.600 --> 00:21:13.600]   You guys are in your own little world there.
[00:21:13.600 --> 00:21:16.600]   So the Apple disabling iOS devices,
[00:21:16.600 --> 00:21:18.200]   Andy, you're gonna have to kind of suss this out,
[00:21:18.200 --> 00:21:20.160]   'cause I don't understand what this means.
[00:21:20.160 --> 00:21:22.720]   So Apple's disabling iOS 5 devices,
[00:21:22.720 --> 00:21:26.160]   from people who have purchased UDIDs from other developers.
[00:21:26.160 --> 00:21:28.960]   So this is, developers get access to a certain,
[00:21:28.960 --> 00:21:30.680]   they get slots for the UDIDs,
[00:21:30.680 --> 00:21:34.240]   so that they can do their testing with iOS 5.
[00:21:34.240 --> 00:21:37.040]   And I guess some of them have been making those available.
[00:21:37.040 --> 00:21:41.360]   - Yeah, they're, as far as I know,
[00:21:41.360 --> 00:21:43.000]   there are two or three different reasons
[00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:47.320]   why someone might wanna have apps run this way.
[00:21:47.320 --> 00:21:48.800]   And one of them is for piracy,
[00:21:48.800 --> 00:21:50.880]   one of them is so that you don't really have the right
[00:21:50.880 --> 00:21:54.320]   to run the software for one of any different reasons,
[00:21:54.320 --> 00:21:55.480]   you don't have the right to run the software,
[00:21:55.480 --> 00:21:59.200]   but this is a shortcut to running that software, shall we say.
[00:21:59.200 --> 00:22:01.160]   As to what the larger thing beyond that,
[00:22:01.160 --> 00:22:04.600]   I've been a little bit curious about that myself.
[00:22:04.600 --> 00:22:06.760]   My first reaction is what do they have,
[00:22:06.760 --> 00:22:08.440]   what's gonna be in the next beta
[00:22:08.440 --> 00:22:11.200]   that would cause this sort of system to break.
[00:22:11.200 --> 00:22:13.200]   But it seems to be sort of a,
[00:22:13.200 --> 00:22:17.040]   it seems an interesting timing because AT&T,
[00:22:17.040 --> 00:22:20.320]   I think already did, basically said that
[00:22:20.320 --> 00:22:22.240]   if you have Jill broken your phone
[00:22:22.240 --> 00:22:24.720]   to enable Wi-Fi hotspot sharing,
[00:22:24.720 --> 00:22:27.440]   which is in direct violation of the agreement you signed
[00:22:27.440 --> 00:22:29.960]   by having an account with AT&T, guess what?
[00:22:29.960 --> 00:22:32.040]   You just lost your unlimited data access,
[00:22:32.040 --> 00:22:34.440]   we are switching you back down to a tiered data plant
[00:22:34.440 --> 00:22:35.880]   and there ain't boo you can do about it.
[00:22:35.880 --> 00:22:37.440]   - And then the thing is that your people know
[00:22:37.440 --> 00:22:39.160]   that you're sharing that hotspot
[00:22:39.160 --> 00:22:42.200]   because they can see the other multiple,
[00:22:42.200 --> 00:22:43.760]   I guess it's not entirely malicious, right?
[00:22:43.760 --> 00:22:45.720]   Andy points out one of many uses, right?
[00:22:45.720 --> 00:22:47.880]   One would be piracy, one would be,
[00:22:47.880 --> 00:22:49.640]   I have no reason to have this beta,
[00:22:49.640 --> 00:22:52.240]   I'm not a developer, so I'm putting it on my device
[00:22:52.240 --> 00:22:54.000]   based on my tablets, UDID.
[00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:57.520]   I send that to the guy, I pay him some cash over PayPal,
[00:22:57.520 --> 00:23:00.560]   he sends me, I send him my UDID number,
[00:23:00.560 --> 00:23:02.680]   he sends me the build, I install it,
[00:23:02.680 --> 00:23:04.280]   boom I'm up and running on iOS 5,
[00:23:04.280 --> 00:23:06.400]   but they're not always as malicious, right?
[00:23:06.400 --> 00:23:07.640]   I mean, there are other instances
[00:23:07.640 --> 00:23:09.320]   where you might not have a developer build,
[00:23:09.320 --> 00:23:10.880]   for instance, I'm working on an iPad app
[00:23:10.880 --> 00:23:14.800]   with a couple of friends and I don't have a developer account.
[00:23:14.800 --> 00:23:16.640]   So therefore, if I need to look at
[00:23:16.640 --> 00:23:18.960]   and see the latest versions of what we're working on,
[00:23:18.960 --> 00:23:21.480]   I, you know, they, I threw my UDID,
[00:23:21.480 --> 00:23:23.000]   I'm able to actually look at the latest build
[00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:24.600]   and so it's not malicious, I'm not out there
[00:23:24.600 --> 00:23:26.960]   trying to pirate, you know, I'm not actually out there
[00:23:26.960 --> 00:23:28.280]   trying to pirate that.
[00:23:28.280 --> 00:23:29.840]   - But actually, actually, it seems as though
[00:23:29.840 --> 00:23:32.760]   this specific action is based on people
[00:23:32.760 --> 00:23:35.680]   who are trying to sell access to the betas of iOS 5,
[00:23:35.680 --> 00:23:39.400]   which is double dumb stupid because anybody with $99
[00:23:39.400 --> 00:23:41.200]   can get iOS 5.
[00:23:41.200 --> 00:23:43.560]   - But they were able to sell it for 25.
[00:23:43.560 --> 00:23:46.640]   - Yeah, but I mean, so the question though,
[00:23:46.640 --> 00:23:48.720]   it's not something that's being released
[00:23:48.720 --> 00:23:51.960]   in the next version of iOS 5 that would brick their device,
[00:23:51.960 --> 00:23:53.520]   right, they're Apple simply going through
[00:23:53.520 --> 00:23:55.960]   and noticing the UDID numbers out there
[00:23:55.960 --> 00:23:57.600]   that are floating around who have access
[00:23:57.600 --> 00:23:59.240]   to that same developer's account
[00:23:59.240 --> 00:24:00.960]   and they're breaking those devices
[00:24:00.960 --> 00:24:02.560]   based on the UDID number, right?
[00:24:02.560 --> 00:24:05.600]   It's not a new build of iOS 5 that went out that brick it.
[00:24:05.600 --> 00:24:07.640]   - What's happened, what's happened apparently is,
[00:24:07.640 --> 00:24:08.560]   I don't have direct knowledge,
[00:24:08.560 --> 00:24:10.600]   I can honestly say I have no direct knowledge of this,
[00:24:10.600 --> 00:24:12.880]   but what I've been told from other people is
[00:24:12.880 --> 00:24:16.520]   and what I've read online since, since Thursday
[00:24:16.520 --> 00:24:20.240]   is that it is a specific punitive action
[00:24:20.240 --> 00:24:23.320]   in which Apple has figured out who's selling,
[00:24:23.320 --> 00:24:25.760]   which developers are selling UDIDs
[00:24:25.760 --> 00:24:29.000]   for whatever stupid reason they wanna sell UDIDs,
[00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:32.200]   that they have essentially slapped these guys pretty hard
[00:24:32.200 --> 00:24:35.440]   and also that any device that is accessing iOS 5
[00:24:35.440 --> 00:24:37.600]   with these UDIDs will no longer work.
[00:24:37.600 --> 00:24:40.480]   So it's not being ricked, it means that they can still
[00:24:40.480 --> 00:24:42.840]   downgrade back to the currently shipping version of iOS
[00:24:42.840 --> 00:24:44.760]   and presumably they'll still be able to,
[00:24:44.760 --> 00:24:46.560]   if you bought one of these UDIDs,
[00:24:46.560 --> 00:24:48.160]   you can still have a working phone,
[00:24:48.160 --> 00:24:51.280]   it's just that the free lunch tray is now over going.
[00:24:51.280 --> 00:24:52.840]   - Here's the question though, here's the question related
[00:24:52.840 --> 00:24:55.440]   to this is that is it, as Apple gets smarter about this
[00:24:55.440 --> 00:24:57.760]   and as AT&T is obviously getting smarter about this,
[00:24:57.760 --> 00:25:00.240]   of knowing who's jailbreaking and who's not jailbreaking.
[00:25:00.240 --> 00:25:03.720]   And as your whole world gets tied up more and more
[00:25:03.720 --> 00:25:07.920]   in the iCloud process, is the golden era
[00:25:07.920 --> 00:25:09.520]   of jailbreaking kind of over?
[00:25:09.520 --> 00:25:11.320]   I mean, is it getting to a point where Apple's just gonna
[00:25:11.320 --> 00:25:13.880]   kinda shut you out of a lot of those services
[00:25:13.880 --> 00:25:15.720]   if you're jailbreaking your phone?
[00:25:15.720 --> 00:25:18.320]   It seems like they're starting to be pretty refined.
[00:25:18.320 --> 00:25:20.680]   - I don't think so, because that would be a really
[00:25:20.680 --> 00:25:23.060]   over gesture for Apple to make.
[00:25:23.060 --> 00:25:26.100]   Right now Apple will not necessarily punish somebody
[00:25:26.100 --> 00:25:27.620]   for jailbreaking a phone.
[00:25:27.620 --> 00:25:28.860]   They are, they're--
[00:25:28.860 --> 00:25:30.220]   - But couldn't they just say well,
[00:25:30.220 --> 00:25:32.620]   those services only work if you haven't jailbricked it?
[00:25:32.620 --> 00:25:34.780]   - Their consistent stance has always been that
[00:25:34.780 --> 00:25:36.580]   if someone jail breaks a phone, that means that there's
[00:25:36.580 --> 00:25:38.580]   a security vulnerability and we need to patch
[00:25:38.580 --> 00:25:39.580]   that vulnerability.
[00:25:39.580 --> 00:25:42.420]   They haven't simply said that anybody who has
[00:25:42.420 --> 00:25:44.780]   a jailbroken phone, we are gonna send out the
[00:25:44.780 --> 00:25:47.420]   electromagnetic pulse wave that kills your device.
[00:25:47.420 --> 00:25:49.980]   It's only the people who are doing things that are naughty
[00:25:49.980 --> 00:25:51.260]   with a jailbroken phone that say,
[00:25:51.260 --> 00:25:52.860]   well you know what, you agreed not to do this,
[00:25:52.860 --> 00:25:55.220]   you did this, we're exercising our right to terminate you.
[00:25:55.220 --> 00:25:57.700]   - But my only point here is that if Apple were to
[00:25:57.700 --> 00:26:00.780]   suddenly do something to simply say that we're gonna
[00:26:00.780 --> 00:26:03.780]   make sure that every, it's not possible to even use
[00:26:03.780 --> 00:26:06.860]   a jailbroken phone on any network to have any access
[00:26:06.860 --> 00:26:10.180]   to any app updates and that our operating system will fail
[00:26:10.180 --> 00:26:12.820]   if you don't have this working.
[00:26:12.820 --> 00:26:16.140]   To do something really extreme, I think would a,
[00:26:16.140 --> 00:26:18.220]   ruin the user experience would make that phone less
[00:26:18.220 --> 00:26:19.780]   reliable for legitimate users.
[00:26:19.780 --> 00:26:23.380]   And also, you don't want to be seen as coming back
[00:26:23.380 --> 00:26:27.180]   with the steel foot on people's necks unnecessarily.
[00:26:27.180 --> 00:26:29.220]   And right now, jailbreaking is such a non-issue
[00:26:29.220 --> 00:26:31.260]   for so many people that are involved.
[00:26:31.260 --> 00:26:32.580]   - And we don't even know what percentage of people
[00:26:32.580 --> 00:26:34.420]   are actually jailbreaking, I'm gonna guess that it's far
[00:26:34.420 --> 00:26:35.780]   less than 1%.
[00:26:35.780 --> 00:26:37.340]   - You know, and I would even think to answer your question
[00:26:37.340 --> 00:26:41.100]   about the Golden Days, I would even think that the app store
[00:26:41.100 --> 00:26:45.540]   created the Golden era of jailbreaking pre-app store,
[00:26:45.540 --> 00:26:46.820]   post-app store.
[00:26:46.820 --> 00:26:48.780]   I know a lot of people who used to jailbreak their phones
[00:26:48.780 --> 00:26:50.300]   before the app store was around,
[00:26:50.300 --> 00:26:52.060]   and then they don't see any reason to anymore.
[00:26:52.060 --> 00:26:53.220]   - Well, I think one of the common places,
[00:26:53.220 --> 00:26:55.020]   I mean, where I see most jailbroken phones
[00:26:55.020 --> 00:26:57.100]   are in countries that aren't being supported by,
[00:26:57.100 --> 00:26:59.900]   you know, they don't have access to the iPhone.
[00:26:59.900 --> 00:27:01.900]   So what they're doing, you know, that's the most common way
[00:27:01.900 --> 00:27:05.140]   to, the reason the jailbreak of phone that I've seen is,
[00:27:05.140 --> 00:27:06.500]   you know, I work in a lot of African countries
[00:27:06.500 --> 00:27:09.100]   and a lot of those aren't served officially,
[00:27:09.100 --> 00:27:10.780]   but there's a lot of iPhones there.
[00:27:10.780 --> 00:27:13.220]   And of course, they're jailbreaking all of them
[00:27:13.220 --> 00:27:14.620]   to make all of that work.
[00:27:14.620 --> 00:27:16.380]   They've got this great one where you can just shake your phone
[00:27:16.380 --> 00:27:19.700]   and it'll answer, they don't have that for the regular iPhone.
[00:27:19.700 --> 00:27:20.540]   I don't really know why.
[00:27:20.540 --> 00:27:23.060]   - See, that would be a mistake because I would be out taking
[00:27:23.060 --> 00:27:25.180]   a walk and I would not want to answer the phone,
[00:27:25.180 --> 00:27:26.380]   you know, mom's calling.
[00:27:26.380 --> 00:27:28.060]   Like, I'll talk to mom a little bit later.
[00:27:28.060 --> 00:27:28.900]   - No, it's great.
[00:27:28.900 --> 00:27:29.740]   - And I'm walking.
[00:27:29.740 --> 00:27:31.300]   - It's one of these, it's just like this,
[00:27:31.300 --> 00:27:33.140]   and then you pick it up and it's answering.
[00:27:33.140 --> 00:27:35.820]   I want that application, but it's only on jailbroken.
[00:27:35.820 --> 00:27:38.900]   - Talk about the risks of like knowing a little bit too much.
[00:27:38.900 --> 00:27:42.540]   I was like, some operating system upgrade
[00:27:42.540 --> 00:27:43.900]   had applied, it worked great.
[00:27:43.900 --> 00:27:45.620]   Like the second day I had it,
[00:27:45.620 --> 00:27:48.500]   I was just really, it was the iTunes app
[00:27:48.500 --> 00:27:51.820]   was really pissing me off because I'd be driving along
[00:27:51.820 --> 00:27:55.940]   and I would keep like changing songs to me in mid-song.
[00:27:55.940 --> 00:27:59.180]   I'm like, "God dang it, do I have like corrupted music files?
[00:27:59.180 --> 00:28:00.460]   Is it like a buggy app?"
[00:28:00.460 --> 00:28:01.780]   And it wasn't until like the day later
[00:28:01.780 --> 00:28:03.700]   and lots of shouting at this inanimate object,
[00:28:03.700 --> 00:28:06.780]   my dashboard, I realized that, "Oh, every time I hit a bump,
[00:28:06.780 --> 00:28:08.940]   it shakes the phone and it thinks,
[00:28:08.940 --> 00:28:11.060]   'Oh, he wants to shuffle to another song.'
[00:28:11.060 --> 00:28:12.740]   At that point, it's a shuffle.
[00:28:12.740 --> 00:28:14.220]   What if I were to just take this
[00:28:14.220 --> 00:28:16.540]   and slide that to the off position?"
[00:28:16.540 --> 00:28:18.340]   - Okay, so there were so many people
[00:28:18.340 --> 00:28:19.780]   because that was a default setting, right?
[00:28:19.780 --> 00:28:21.780]   And I had a lot of people that were so frustrated,
[00:28:21.780 --> 00:28:24.140]   they'd get a new iPhone and they'd come to me,
[00:28:24.140 --> 00:28:26.580]   you know, 'cause I'm like default IT guy at Fox
[00:28:26.580 --> 00:28:28.460]   and they'd come to me, "I love this phone,
[00:28:28.460 --> 00:28:30.100]   but God, every time I'm listening to music,
[00:28:30.100 --> 00:28:32.460]   when I'm on a jog, it jumps to another song.
[00:28:32.460 --> 00:28:35.340]   I'm about to take this thing back."
[00:28:35.340 --> 00:28:36.940]   - Does Apple have a department
[00:28:36.940 --> 00:28:38.940]   of choosing the wrong default setting?
[00:28:38.940 --> 00:28:41.100]   Because when they chose that, "Gee, what do people
[00:28:41.100 --> 00:28:43.380]   want to use this big switch on the side for?
[00:28:43.380 --> 00:28:46.380]   Of this big tablet device that people tend to read,
[00:28:46.380 --> 00:28:47.700]   like holding in different angles,
[00:28:47.700 --> 00:28:50.060]   should it be locked the screen so it doesn't rotate
[00:28:50.060 --> 00:28:52.340]   when I simply like go from a sitting up
[00:28:52.340 --> 00:28:53.700]   to sort of a leaning position,
[00:28:53.700 --> 00:28:56.900]   or should it be mute these really puny little speakers
[00:28:56.900 --> 00:29:00.140]   that people really don't use to listen to at all anyway?"
[00:29:00.140 --> 00:29:01.540]   - Right, right.
[00:29:01.540 --> 00:29:04.020]   So we've got Apple, we've got a couple more things
[00:29:04.020 --> 00:29:04.860]   about Apple.
[00:29:04.860 --> 00:29:07.060]   Mobile Me is going to be,
[00:29:07.060 --> 00:29:08.820]   they're gonna start discontinuing sections,
[00:29:08.820 --> 00:29:11.420]   also moving to the iCloud transition.
[00:29:11.420 --> 00:29:12.260]   But before we get to that,
[00:29:12.260 --> 00:29:14.820]   we just want to thank one of our sponsors.
[00:29:14.820 --> 00:29:18.020]   Mac Break Weekly is brought to you by Go To Meeting.
[00:29:18.020 --> 00:29:19.420]   Go To Meeting by Citrix,
[00:29:19.420 --> 00:29:23.340]   it's just a great way to really pull everybody together.
[00:29:23.340 --> 00:29:26.260]   We use Go To Meeting every week inside of,
[00:29:26.260 --> 00:29:27.580]   I know that Twit uses it here,
[00:29:27.580 --> 00:29:29.620]   I use it in the Pixel Core all the time.
[00:29:29.620 --> 00:29:31.900]   I mean, this is how we get together.
[00:29:31.900 --> 00:29:33.580]   We have people spread out all over the world,
[00:29:33.580 --> 00:29:34.420]   and even if we don't,
[00:29:34.420 --> 00:29:37.540]   we had a meeting only last week,
[00:29:37.540 --> 00:29:41.020]   it just was inconvenient to drive 45 minutes
[00:29:41.020 --> 00:29:43.860]   through St. Francisco traffic to just have a meeting.
[00:29:43.860 --> 00:29:45.980]   And so we use Go To Meeting to do that,
[00:29:45.980 --> 00:29:46.820]   and now here's the thing,
[00:29:46.820 --> 00:29:48.740]   you can share your screens.
[00:29:48.740 --> 00:29:50.300]   You of course have IP built in,
[00:29:50.300 --> 00:29:52.780]   which I guess I thought all of these companies had,
[00:29:52.780 --> 00:29:54.580]   but it is not the way it is.
[00:29:54.580 --> 00:29:57.260]   A lot of these meeting companies
[00:29:57.260 --> 00:30:00.380]   that don't have the IP built in,
[00:30:00.380 --> 00:30:02.500]   which makes it much less convenient.
[00:30:02.500 --> 00:30:03.900]   So Go To Meeting has all of these things.
[00:30:03.900 --> 00:30:05.820]   It also now has HD faces.
[00:30:05.820 --> 00:30:10.900]   And this may seem like a gimmick
[00:30:10.900 --> 00:30:11.940]   to be able to see people's faces,
[00:30:11.940 --> 00:30:14.660]   but if you're in a long meeting,
[00:30:14.660 --> 00:30:17.060]   looking at someone's screen
[00:30:17.060 --> 00:30:20.220]   while you're having an hour and a half meeting
[00:30:20.220 --> 00:30:22.060]   is a cure for insomnia.
[00:30:22.060 --> 00:30:22.900]   I mean, it is just,
[00:30:22.900 --> 00:30:24.580]   and believe me, we've done lots of those meetings.
[00:30:24.580 --> 00:30:26.860]   And so being able to actually see people,
[00:30:26.860 --> 00:30:29.940]   being able to talk to them and see their face
[00:30:29.940 --> 00:30:31.780]   when they're not doing something on their screen
[00:30:31.780 --> 00:30:32.620]   is really key.
[00:30:32.620 --> 00:30:34.580]   And so now this is available with Go To Meeting,
[00:30:34.580 --> 00:30:36.620]   and we're pretty excited about it.
[00:30:36.620 --> 00:30:39.300]   You can of course use it on the Mac or PC.
[00:30:39.300 --> 00:30:41.420]   And whether you're doing product reviews,
[00:30:41.420 --> 00:30:43.900]   sales presentations, training sessions,
[00:30:43.900 --> 00:30:45.420]   weekly status meetings,
[00:30:45.420 --> 00:30:46.980]   all of that stuff is stuff that you can do
[00:30:46.980 --> 00:30:47.740]   right from your desk.
[00:30:47.740 --> 00:30:50.620]   You don't have to leave,
[00:30:50.620 --> 00:30:52.220]   you don't have to go anywhere,
[00:30:52.220 --> 00:30:53.060]   you don't have to,
[00:30:53.060 --> 00:30:55.420]   it's really the way to go.
[00:30:55.420 --> 00:30:57.420]   This is the future and it's here now.
[00:30:57.420 --> 00:31:01.980]   And we just, I'm so sold on Go To Meeting.
[00:31:01.980 --> 00:31:03.940]   It's something I think when they started doing a sponsor,
[00:31:03.940 --> 00:31:04.980]   we were just getting into it,
[00:31:04.980 --> 00:31:05.860]   and we use Go To Meeting.
[00:31:05.860 --> 00:31:07.100]   We also use Go To Webinar,
[00:31:07.100 --> 00:31:08.980]   which is a slightly bigger version of that.
[00:31:08.980 --> 00:31:13.100]   And it's just a fantastic solution.
[00:31:13.100 --> 00:31:13.940]   So Go To Meeting,
[00:31:13.940 --> 00:31:16.700]   if you want to try a 30 day free trial,
[00:31:16.700 --> 00:31:17.860]   so you can get it for free,
[00:31:17.860 --> 00:31:18.900]   you can try it out,
[00:31:18.900 --> 00:31:20.460]   you can see how well it works for you,
[00:31:20.460 --> 00:31:22.140]   go to gotomeeting.com
[00:31:22.140 --> 00:31:25.100]   and use the offer code MacBreak.
[00:31:25.100 --> 00:31:26.180]   That's gotomeeting.com

[00:31:28.500 --> 00:31:30.660]   And try the HD faces,
[00:31:30.660 --> 00:31:31.860]   try calling some of your friends,
[00:31:31.860 --> 00:31:32.620]   some of your colleagues.
[00:31:32.620 --> 00:31:35.260]   It really, as soon as you start using it,
[00:31:35.260 --> 00:31:37.220]   I think you're gonna have a hard time
[00:31:37.220 --> 00:31:39.380]   justifying getting into the car,
[00:31:39.380 --> 00:31:41.740]   or of the plane and the hotels
[00:31:41.740 --> 00:31:44.140]   and everything else that's required all the time.
[00:31:44.140 --> 00:31:45.740]   So check it out, go to meeting.com
[00:31:45.740 --> 00:31:47.500]   and use the offer code MacBreak.
[00:31:47.500 --> 00:31:53.340]   All right, so Apple is officially killing Mobile Me Sync
[00:31:53.340 --> 00:31:56.740]   for keychains, widgets, account preferences.
[00:31:56.740 --> 00:31:58.740]   So all those things that we've been kind of using
[00:31:58.740 --> 00:32:01.220]   to tie all of our computers together,
[00:32:01.220 --> 00:32:03.700]   Apple is kind of cutting the cord there.
[00:32:03.700 --> 00:32:05.500]   Andy, is this, or do you want it today?
[00:32:05.500 --> 00:32:08.420]   Is this something that we all have to worry about this week?
[00:32:08.420 --> 00:32:12.140]   No, this is just stuff that more developers stuff.
[00:32:12.140 --> 00:32:14.100]   It's only come to light when people,
[00:32:14.100 --> 00:32:17.540]   when developers last week started updating to the new iOS
[00:32:17.540 --> 00:32:19.700]   and trying to use these new services.
[00:32:19.700 --> 00:32:20.700]   And according to screenshots,
[00:32:20.700 --> 00:32:22.860]   you can see up on appleinsider.com,
[00:32:22.860 --> 00:32:25.740]   you can see the walkthrough process that they go through
[00:32:25.740 --> 00:32:27.260]   and part of that walkthrough process,
[00:32:27.260 --> 00:32:29.820]   these developers who are transitioning from mobile,
[00:32:29.820 --> 00:32:31.300]   basically turning their mobile Me accounts
[00:32:31.300 --> 00:32:32.980]   into iCloud accounts.
[00:32:32.980 --> 00:32:35.180]   Part of it is a big screen warning
[00:32:35.180 --> 00:32:37.060]   that says, oh, by the way, here is a list
[00:32:37.060 --> 00:32:38.820]   of the mobile Me features you're currently using
[00:32:38.820 --> 00:32:40.180]   that will not be available.
[00:32:40.180 --> 00:32:42.180]   That includes the stuff that you talked about.
[00:32:42.180 --> 00:32:43.940]   So it's an interesting list.
[00:32:43.940 --> 00:32:46.500]   You could see why dashboard widgets and dock items
[00:32:46.500 --> 00:32:51.460]   might not make sense in an iCloud sort of situation.
[00:32:51.460 --> 00:32:55.060]   Keychains and mail accounts are kind of curious, I think,
[00:32:55.060 --> 00:32:57.940]   because that's part of the magic of upgrading
[00:32:57.940 --> 00:33:01.060]   to a new machine or switching from one machine to another.
[00:33:01.060 --> 00:33:04.500]   The fact that the passwords that I created on my desktop
[00:33:04.500 --> 00:33:07.500]   are gonna work on my new MacBook Air,
[00:33:07.500 --> 00:33:09.980]   whether I'm just taking this thing out of the box right now
[00:33:09.980 --> 00:33:11.900]   or whether I'm just simply using it for the first time
[00:33:11.900 --> 00:33:14.260]   after signing onto this new account back at home.
[00:33:14.260 --> 00:33:16.540]   Is it a security issue or is it a...
[00:33:16.540 --> 00:33:18.940]   There are two things that make me wonder.
[00:33:18.940 --> 00:33:20.740]   One of them is that, yes, it could be,
[00:33:20.740 --> 00:33:23.180]   maybe it's a security issue because one other thing
[00:33:23.180 --> 00:33:25.340]   that's sort of common to all of these things
[00:33:25.340 --> 00:33:27.980]   is that they're basic things that kind of give people
[00:33:27.980 --> 00:33:31.180]   carplank access to a lot of important things in your life.
[00:33:31.180 --> 00:33:35.220]   Another idea is that it's another theory,
[00:33:35.220 --> 00:33:36.940]   and this is underscore just a theory,
[00:33:36.940 --> 00:33:38.700]   is that it's possible we're just seeing,
[00:33:38.700 --> 00:33:42.060]   sort of the leading edge of a new infrastructure
[00:33:42.060 --> 00:33:44.540]   for those services that hasn't been announced yet,
[00:33:44.540 --> 00:33:46.100]   but is coming soon.
[00:33:46.100 --> 00:33:48.860]   And so they're recontextualizing the idea
[00:33:48.860 --> 00:33:51.220]   of how to sync passwords and accounts
[00:33:51.220 --> 00:33:53.460]   between multiple machines through the cloud.
[00:33:53.460 --> 00:33:55.580]   They've looked at keychain access
[00:33:55.580 --> 00:33:57.140]   and the old way that mail used to handle
[00:33:57.140 --> 00:33:58.460]   that sort of stuff and decided,
[00:33:58.460 --> 00:34:00.660]   know if we have this really cool cloud system
[00:34:00.660 --> 00:34:02.300]   and they're running online,
[00:34:02.300 --> 00:34:04.100]   there's a much better way we can do this.
[00:34:04.100 --> 00:34:05.620]   We haven't finalized that,
[00:34:05.620 --> 00:34:06.620]   we're not ready to announce it yet,
[00:34:06.620 --> 00:34:08.220]   but we're not going to have people,
[00:34:08.220 --> 00:34:10.420]   but we don't want to have people convert twice,
[00:34:10.420 --> 00:34:13.860]   so we're just going to cut off access starting next month
[00:34:13.860 --> 00:34:16.860]   and then have something ready to go shortly after that.
[00:34:16.860 --> 00:34:18.300]   Now that we've done that before.
[00:34:18.300 --> 00:34:20.300]   - Can I ask you, is included in this,
[00:34:20.300 --> 00:34:23.460]   is Safari and/or bookmarks preferences
[00:34:23.460 --> 00:34:24.580]   and those sorts of things?
[00:34:24.580 --> 00:34:27.100]   I couldn't find that if that is included in it.
[00:34:28.180 --> 00:34:30.980]   Not that it's ever done a good job of syncing anyway.
[00:34:30.980 --> 00:34:34.620]   So I actually hope this is an opportunity
[00:34:34.620 --> 00:34:36.540]   to clean this stuff up because,
[00:34:36.540 --> 00:34:38.740]   whether or not stuff shows up on one computer
[00:34:38.740 --> 00:34:40.700]   when I'm upgrading or I'm moving from one machine
[00:34:40.700 --> 00:34:42.620]   to another or I have multiple machines
[00:34:42.620 --> 00:34:44.460]   that I want to keep in sync,
[00:34:44.460 --> 00:34:46.420]   none of them look similar.
[00:34:46.420 --> 00:34:47.260]   They're all the--
[00:34:47.260 --> 00:34:48.820]   - And I've been trying it,
[00:34:48.820 --> 00:34:51.220]   I mean I've been trying to deal with the situation
[00:34:51.220 --> 00:34:53.340]   where I try to keep everything synced between,
[00:34:53.340 --> 00:34:54.780]   I have an 11 inch, a 17 inch,
[00:34:54.780 --> 00:34:59.780]   11 inch of the air, the 17 inch MacBook Pro
[00:34:59.780 --> 00:35:02.220]   and then a tower at home.
[00:35:02.220 --> 00:35:03.380]   And I've been doing the best I can
[00:35:03.380 --> 00:35:04.220]   to try to keep them all,
[00:35:04.220 --> 00:35:05.140]   but I have the same problem that you have
[00:35:05.140 --> 00:35:07.380]   which is that some of the stuff is making it there,
[00:35:07.380 --> 00:35:08.180]   some of it isn't.
[00:35:08.180 --> 00:35:09.500]   I've been trying to kind of figure out
[00:35:09.500 --> 00:35:11.220]   what it takes to make all of that work.
[00:35:11.220 --> 00:35:13.860]   I've gotten the mail mostly working,
[00:35:13.860 --> 00:35:16.420]   but it does seem to be kind of a hit or miss
[00:35:16.420 --> 00:35:18.060]   kind of process right now.
[00:35:18.060 --> 00:35:20.220]   - And I really can't get to the bottom of why,
[00:35:20.220 --> 00:35:23.940]   why Safari, why my bookmarks menu
[00:35:23.940 --> 00:35:26.020]   and my bookmarks bar will look completely different
[00:35:26.020 --> 00:35:28.900]   from machine to machine on a regular basis.
[00:35:28.900 --> 00:35:30.220]   - Right, yeah, so it's, you know,
[00:35:30.220 --> 00:35:31.740]   I think that it never really worked.
[00:35:31.740 --> 00:35:34.700]   So it looks like when I look at what they're discontinuing,
[00:35:34.700 --> 00:35:36.340]   I mean you look at the discontinuing gallery,
[00:35:36.340 --> 00:35:39.180]   iDISC, iWeb, none of that really worked very well.
[00:35:39.180 --> 00:35:40.340]   So I think that it's kind of like,
[00:35:40.340 --> 00:35:42.260]   okay, we're gonna cut some of our losses,
[00:35:42.260 --> 00:35:44.260]   figure out another way to do it,
[00:35:44.260 --> 00:35:45.780]   keep the stuff that was really working
[00:35:45.780 --> 00:35:46.980]   or working fairly well.
[00:35:46.980 --> 00:35:48.460]   I have to admit that the address,
[00:35:48.460 --> 00:35:49.980]   have the addresses worked for you?
[00:35:49.980 --> 00:35:51.500]   I have some computers with some addresses
[00:35:51.500 --> 00:35:52.620]   and some with others.
[00:35:52.620 --> 00:35:55.340]   - And I think I'm multiple versions.
[00:35:55.340 --> 00:35:56.260]   - Yeah, that's the worst.
[00:35:56.260 --> 00:35:58.420]   I mean, I want to live in that.
[00:35:58.420 --> 00:36:00.300]   I want to have one simple ecosystem
[00:36:00.300 --> 00:36:02.180]   where I'm not having to rely on Google calendars
[00:36:02.180 --> 00:36:03.700]   on top of this and, you know,
[00:36:03.700 --> 00:36:05.580]   I want to have one place where I don't have to,
[00:36:05.580 --> 00:36:08.460]   I add an address on one device and I expect it then
[00:36:08.460 --> 00:36:11.260]   to be on all my devices and it's never there
[00:36:11.260 --> 00:36:13.820]   or half of it is there, just the email address managed
[00:36:13.820 --> 00:36:14.660]   to make it.
[00:36:14.660 --> 00:36:15.500]   - Right.
[00:36:15.500 --> 00:36:16.580]   - It's like, come on little buddy.
[00:36:16.580 --> 00:36:18.620]   Why can't the phone number also make it in there?
[00:36:18.620 --> 00:36:20.460]   You know, it's just, yeah.
[00:36:20.460 --> 00:36:23.660]   - I think it's very telling that just yesterday
[00:36:23.660 --> 00:36:26.060]   I was talking to somebody making a new appointment
[00:36:26.060 --> 00:36:29.620]   on my iPhone and if it's a really important appointment,
[00:36:29.620 --> 00:36:33.020]   I will make the appointment on my iPhone.
[00:36:33.020 --> 00:36:34.740]   I will make sure I double check to make sure
[00:36:34.740 --> 00:36:36.180]   that I've submitted it properly.
[00:36:36.180 --> 00:36:37.220]   I will double check to make sure
[00:36:37.220 --> 00:36:38.420]   that I go back to the calendar page.
[00:36:38.420 --> 00:36:40.220]   I can see that little pip and the date that says
[00:36:40.220 --> 00:36:42.140]   that yes, the iPhone believes that's there,
[00:36:42.140 --> 00:36:45.740]   but I will also take a screenshot of that appointment
[00:36:45.740 --> 00:36:48.780]   so that I know that somewhere there is a copy of this
[00:36:48.780 --> 00:36:50.940]   that will not be deleted, will not be re-synced,
[00:36:50.940 --> 00:36:52.780]   will not be overwritten by anything else
[00:36:52.780 --> 00:36:55.540]   because this appointment, yes, is that important?
[00:36:55.540 --> 00:36:59.100]   And I trust syncing not 100%.
[00:36:59.100 --> 00:37:00.980]   Although to answer your original question,
[00:37:00.980 --> 00:37:03.620]   bookmarks are included as part of what iCloud
[00:37:03.620 --> 00:37:04.740]   is gonna sync with.
[00:37:04.740 --> 00:37:07.020]   So such a calendar's context bookmarks.
[00:37:07.020 --> 00:37:11.340]   I'm reading, I'm looking at the screenshot again.
[00:37:11.340 --> 00:37:12.300]   Email address is right.
[00:37:12.300 --> 00:37:17.260]   So just calendars, contacts and bookmarks are safe.
[00:37:17.260 --> 00:37:19.420]   The other ones have been sent off the island.
[00:37:19.420 --> 00:37:20.260]   - Here we go.
[00:37:20.260 --> 00:37:23.380]   Now jumping the track completely to another subject,
[00:37:23.380 --> 00:37:25.460]   Epic Games President suggests Apple,
[00:37:25.460 --> 00:37:27.460]   the act, this is according to 9-5 Mac,
[00:37:27.460 --> 00:37:29.620]   the accidental gaming giant is
[00:37:29.620 --> 00:37:32.060]   obsolete next-gen consoles.
[00:37:32.060 --> 00:37:35.060]   Now here's the real question I have about this is,
[00:37:35.060 --> 00:37:37.220]   is it really an accidental gaming giant?
[00:37:37.220 --> 00:37:38.300]   - Right, the headline.
[00:37:38.300 --> 00:37:40.340]   - I mean, Apple just backed right into that.
[00:37:40.340 --> 00:37:43.900]   I remember seeing something on CNN one time
[00:37:43.900 --> 00:37:45.340]   where they were sitting there talking about
[00:37:45.340 --> 00:37:47.820]   how the military was taking advantage of GPS technology
[00:37:47.820 --> 00:37:48.820]   for their own uses.
[00:37:48.820 --> 00:37:51.500]   And I was like, "Mm, that might have been backwards."
[00:37:51.500 --> 00:37:53.060]   So yeah, so.
[00:37:53.060 --> 00:37:55.020]   - It's a complete act that two months ago,
[00:37:55.020 --> 00:37:57.500]   I had a meeting with Apple and a briefing with Apple
[00:37:57.500 --> 00:37:59.900]   specifically, and the only reason I was there
[00:37:59.900 --> 00:38:02.180]   was to look at third party apps and games
[00:38:02.180 --> 00:38:05.580]   for the iOS platform, how that these certain games
[00:38:05.580 --> 00:38:09.220]   would airplay, you know, having that family experience.
[00:38:09.220 --> 00:38:10.820]   It's really important to Apple.
[00:38:10.820 --> 00:38:13.540]   The fact that they would call it an accident is laughable.
[00:38:13.540 --> 00:38:15.220]   - Well, I mean, do you think that there's a real tie in?
[00:38:15.220 --> 00:38:17.340]   I mean, so obviously, I mean, the only place I play games,
[00:38:17.340 --> 00:38:20.260]   actually, and most people I know actually,
[00:38:20.260 --> 00:38:22.420]   when I think about how many people I know playing games,
[00:38:22.420 --> 00:38:23.980]   most of them are playing them on their iPhones,
[00:38:23.980 --> 00:38:24.820]   on their iPads.
[00:38:24.820 --> 00:38:27.260]   They're not playing, they don't have consoles.
[00:38:27.260 --> 00:38:28.860]   And I'm not saying that there's a lot of people out there
[00:38:28.860 --> 00:38:29.700]   with consoles.
[00:38:29.700 --> 00:38:31.660]   I mean, it's still a very, very big industry.
[00:38:31.660 --> 00:38:34.940]   It's just that it definitely seems like the casual gamer
[00:38:34.940 --> 00:38:36.060]   is a much larger market.
[00:38:36.060 --> 00:38:39.340]   But do you think that the integration,
[00:38:39.340 --> 00:38:43.620]   or the coming integration with Apple TV, iPhones,
[00:38:43.620 --> 00:38:46.540]   and iPads really creates a whole new opportunity
[00:38:46.540 --> 00:38:49.380]   for what the gaming experience may look like?
[00:38:49.380 --> 00:38:52.020]   Because you now have, I mean, right now,
[00:38:52.020 --> 00:38:53.380]   we're just sitting there using airplay, you know,
[00:38:53.380 --> 00:38:55.620]   so we're taking our, you know, playing Angry Birds
[00:38:55.620 --> 00:38:57.340]   on a HD monitor.
[00:38:57.340 --> 00:39:00.580]   But what if the, if all, you could have six iPads
[00:39:00.580 --> 00:39:03.740]   in a living room all tied into playing a game
[00:39:03.740 --> 00:39:06.460]   on your Apple TV that is projecting onto the,
[00:39:06.460 --> 00:39:08.860]   you know, that's coming out of a TV.
[00:39:08.860 --> 00:39:10.820]   And all of those interfaces could be their own
[00:39:10.820 --> 00:39:11.740]   individual interfaces.
[00:39:11.740 --> 00:39:14.780]   But I look at it like when I'm thinking about Marathon,
[00:39:14.780 --> 00:39:17.660]   you know, Marathon being one of my favorite games,
[00:39:17.660 --> 00:39:18.740]   which is now on the iPad,
[00:39:18.740 --> 00:39:21.500]   but they don't have any kind of game play.
[00:39:21.500 --> 00:39:22.780]   And you can imagine having something
[00:39:22.780 --> 00:39:26.300]   that you could use both individually or as a group,
[00:39:26.300 --> 00:39:28.780]   you know, to take advantage of it.
[00:39:28.780 --> 00:39:30.700]   - Yeah, I mean, there's, there's,
[00:39:30.700 --> 00:39:33.020]   the article that's linked to,
[00:39:33.020 --> 00:39:36.580]   the statement that they've made is all about how
[00:39:36.580 --> 00:39:38.140]   they're kind of wondering if Apple's gonna come up
[00:39:38.140 --> 00:39:40.220]   with a game console to which pretty much
[00:39:40.220 --> 00:39:41.820]   everybody in this room and everybody listening,
[00:39:41.820 --> 00:39:43.500]   their answer is they have a game console.
[00:39:43.500 --> 00:39:44.620]   It's called the Apple TV.
[00:39:44.620 --> 00:39:45.940]   It's been hidden all this time.
[00:39:45.940 --> 00:39:46.780]   - Right.
[00:39:46.780 --> 00:39:48.980]   - Apple really does make, I mean,
[00:39:48.980 --> 00:39:51.820]   I just realized that to compare something technological
[00:39:51.820 --> 00:39:54.140]   to a Trojan horse is probably going to go down
[00:39:54.140 --> 00:39:55.180]   not the way that I intended to,
[00:39:55.180 --> 00:39:57.300]   but that's, that's, that's often the way
[00:39:57.300 --> 00:39:59.460]   that they develop technology where here's,
[00:39:59.460 --> 00:40:01.460]   here we have this thing called the Apple TV.
[00:40:01.460 --> 00:40:02.900]   And it lets you do Netflix.
[00:40:02.900 --> 00:40:04.020]   Oh, let's you play music.
[00:40:04.020 --> 00:40:07.500]   And it lets you also play videos right through your HD TV.
[00:40:07.500 --> 00:40:11.780]   But lurking inside the Apple TV is an iPad iOS device
[00:40:11.780 --> 00:40:13.540]   that can run almost any application that Apple
[00:40:13.540 --> 00:40:14.580]   seems to release to it.
[00:40:14.580 --> 00:40:15.620]   So, yep.
[00:40:15.620 --> 00:40:18.060]   I mean, if, if I'm a, the only problem,
[00:40:18.060 --> 00:40:20.700]   the only disconnect with mobile gaming is that it's,
[00:40:20.700 --> 00:40:23.940]   it strips out a lot of the social aspect of gaming,
[00:40:23.940 --> 00:40:27.500]   which is what pulls so many people into these communities.
[00:40:27.500 --> 00:40:30.500]   And so without that one big screen in the middle of the room,
[00:40:30.500 --> 00:40:32.740]   the five people were not gonna be in that room
[00:40:32.740 --> 00:40:34.000]   with their iPads and their iPhones,
[00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:36.140]   but you use the Apple TV as a hub between them.
[00:40:36.140 --> 00:40:39.540]   And it's really interesting to, to, to,
[00:40:39.540 --> 00:40:41.660]   sus this problem for these game companies.
[00:40:41.660 --> 00:40:42.860]   Because you know how, you know how long
[00:40:42.860 --> 00:40:44.780]   the development process is on these games.
[00:40:44.780 --> 00:40:45.860]   They have to start developing.
[00:40:45.860 --> 00:40:48.300]   It's, it really is like a big budget Hollywood movie
[00:40:48.300 --> 00:40:50.260]   where they have to start planning today for a game
[00:40:50.260 --> 00:40:51.780]   they're gonna release three years from now.
[00:40:51.780 --> 00:40:54.660]   And it is really very credible for them to start thinking,
[00:40:54.660 --> 00:40:58.140]   do we want to, do we want to build a, a, an eight million
[00:40:58.140 --> 00:41:01.660]   dollar console game, not knowing whether or not consoles
[00:41:01.660 --> 00:41:04.460]   will still be at the top of the heap in three or four years,
[00:41:04.460 --> 00:41:07.300]   or should we just start right away doing iOS,
[00:41:07.300 --> 00:41:09.660]   assuming that sometime next year,
[00:41:09.660 --> 00:41:11.420]   we will have a top secret meeting with Apple
[00:41:11.420 --> 00:41:15.220]   in which we will be sent home with an aluminum case device
[00:41:15.220 --> 00:41:17.420]   that's glued to a big panel.
[00:41:17.420 --> 00:41:20.100]   That doesn't allow us to take it out of a certain room
[00:41:20.100 --> 00:41:21.700]   because that's where they're taking gaming
[00:41:21.700 --> 00:41:22.780]   the next three years.
[00:41:22.780 --> 00:41:23.780]   - Yeah, it's interesting.
[00:41:23.780 --> 00:41:25.900]   Well, the console, I mean, the console thing is interesting
[00:41:25.900 --> 00:41:28.780]   to me at least from the gamers who are going off to college.
[00:41:28.780 --> 00:41:30.580]   And they're relying on their Xbox for everything.
[00:41:30.580 --> 00:41:32.660]   And colleges now are seeing this trend on campuses
[00:41:32.660 --> 00:41:36.180]   where they're cutting cable as part of the dorm room packages.
[00:41:36.180 --> 00:41:40.580]   And many, many kids are just taking their Xbox
[00:41:40.580 --> 00:41:42.580]   and they're using their Xbox because they can get their,
[00:41:42.580 --> 00:41:44.300]   they can get ESPN on their Xbox,
[00:41:44.300 --> 00:41:45.900]   they can get Netflix on their Xbox,
[00:41:45.900 --> 00:41:47.900]   and then they can play with their college friends,
[00:41:47.900 --> 00:41:49.700]   all those games in that live experience.
[00:41:49.700 --> 00:41:51.980]   So I think that that social component is really important.
[00:41:51.980 --> 00:41:54.380]   I don't know that Apple has that tied up yet.
[00:41:54.380 --> 00:41:56.340]   And I also wonder if there's a bit of a limitation
[00:41:56.340 --> 00:41:57.180]   in the interface.
[00:41:57.180 --> 00:42:00.140]   I think very often we're seeing these first person shooter games
[00:42:00.140 --> 00:42:04.220]   when you're using the accelerometer and the gyroscope.
[00:42:04.220 --> 00:42:06.260]   I think you're seeing some exciting things.
[00:42:06.260 --> 00:42:08.020]   But I don't know that it's there yet.
[00:42:08.020 --> 00:42:09.340]   I think that there's something to be said
[00:42:09.340 --> 00:42:11.180]   for having that controller in your hand
[00:42:11.180 --> 00:42:13.140]   and being able to manipulate and fire guns
[00:42:13.140 --> 00:42:13.980]   with that controller.
[00:42:13.980 --> 00:42:17.620]   So I don't know that it's all sussed out just yet.
[00:42:17.620 --> 00:42:19.460]   - Yeah, I mean, I think that it'll be interesting to see.
[00:42:19.460 --> 00:42:22.060]   I do think that it depends on the kind of gamer.
[00:42:22.060 --> 00:42:24.180]   I think the traditional gamer that's expecting to have
[00:42:24.180 --> 00:42:26.020]   the higher, you know, I think you're definitely seeing
[00:42:26.020 --> 00:42:28.140]   a much higher performance in a lot of these game consoles
[00:42:28.140 --> 00:42:30.300]   than what you're gonna see with an Apple TV.
[00:42:30.300 --> 00:42:32.780]   And just a matter of the kind of games that you're gonna play
[00:42:32.780 --> 00:42:34.580]   and which ones will be the most popular
[00:42:34.580 --> 00:42:35.540]   and the infrastructure.
[00:42:35.540 --> 00:42:37.420]   I mean, every game developer I've talked to
[00:42:37.420 --> 00:42:39.500]   who actually develops, we have a lot of pixel members
[00:42:39.500 --> 00:42:41.220]   that work in game companies.
[00:42:41.220 --> 00:42:43.140]   Building for the Xbox and especially for the PS3
[00:42:43.140 --> 00:42:46.940]   is not, you know, for the fainted heart.
[00:42:46.940 --> 00:42:50.620]   As far as developing the rules of engagement
[00:42:50.620 --> 00:42:52.660]   to get it to work inside of that platform
[00:42:52.660 --> 00:42:55.540]   is pretty outrageous.
[00:42:55.540 --> 00:42:57.220]   - I have two called arms right now.
[00:42:57.220 --> 00:42:58.980]   I'm gonna put this out there because I need it
[00:42:58.980 --> 00:43:03.220]   and I need the audience's help to kind of drive this.
[00:43:03.220 --> 00:43:06.220]   Firefly Studios, makers of one of my all time favorite games,
[00:43:06.220 --> 00:43:07.500]   Stronghold.
[00:43:07.500 --> 00:43:09.140]   I don't know if you remember this great PC game
[00:43:09.140 --> 00:43:11.380]   and then they had Stronghold 2 and so forth.
[00:43:11.380 --> 00:43:14.180]   Please, please put this on the iPad.
[00:43:14.180 --> 00:43:16.420]   It is begging for you to make this.
[00:43:16.420 --> 00:43:18.380]   You know, we have the tower defense category
[00:43:18.380 --> 00:43:21.140]   that exists now as a result of the iPad and the iPhone.
[00:43:21.140 --> 00:43:26.220]   This is calling out for one of the great, great castle games
[00:43:26.220 --> 00:43:27.460]   ever made.
[00:43:27.460 --> 00:43:29.220]   And it's not just a tower defense game,
[00:43:29.220 --> 00:43:32.980]   but I spent, I think I wasted two years of my life
[00:43:32.980 --> 00:43:35.620]   playing this game on a PC and I'm begging for you
[00:43:35.620 --> 00:43:37.420]   to please put it down on the iPad
[00:43:37.420 --> 00:43:39.420]   'cause it's perfect for it.
[00:43:39.420 --> 00:43:41.860]   It's like having a board game in your lap
[00:43:41.860 --> 00:43:43.700]   and ability to manipulate castles and things.
[00:43:43.700 --> 00:43:45.180]   And I just still don't think,
[00:43:45.180 --> 00:43:46.860]   I searched the App Store on a regular basis
[00:43:46.860 --> 00:43:50.100]   for compelling games and I just don't find them,
[00:43:50.100 --> 00:43:52.220]   either they're sort of the casual fun game.
[00:43:52.220 --> 00:43:53.580]   I wanna sit, I do wanna spend,
[00:43:53.580 --> 00:43:55.300]   I wanna waste the next two years of my life
[00:43:55.300 --> 00:43:58.540]   playing stronghold on the iPad.
[00:43:58.540 --> 00:44:00.300]   - I don't know if I just don't,
[00:44:00.300 --> 00:44:02.420]   what I like is the fact that I'm not totally hooked.
[00:44:02.420 --> 00:44:04.740]   I mean, it's bad enough that I feel like my life
[00:44:04.740 --> 00:44:06.540]   is out of equilibrium when I don't have three stars
[00:44:06.540 --> 00:44:08.540]   on every Angry Birds level.
[00:44:08.540 --> 00:44:09.620]   So like the new level comes out,
[00:44:09.620 --> 00:44:10.940]   like a new set of levels come out and I'm like,
[00:44:10.940 --> 00:44:13.780]   oh, it's like four days that I have to--
[00:44:13.780 --> 00:44:15.540]   - And I'm sure we have a lot of Star Trek fans
[00:44:15.540 --> 00:44:17.180]   in this audience too.
[00:44:17.180 --> 00:44:19.340]   Wouldn't this be, you know, you go through the App Store,
[00:44:19.340 --> 00:44:21.700]   the Mac App Store and you look at some of the Star Trek games
[00:44:21.700 --> 00:44:24.380]   in those top down shooters, right?
[00:44:24.380 --> 00:44:25.940]   The top down Star Trek shooters
[00:44:25.940 --> 00:44:27.580]   where you're controlling the enterprise,
[00:44:27.580 --> 00:44:29.900]   zipping through asteroids, battling other starships,
[00:44:29.900 --> 00:44:32.620]   this device, the iPad, is ready made
[00:44:32.620 --> 00:44:34.300]   for a top down Star Trek game.
[00:44:34.300 --> 00:44:35.220]   Get on it.
[00:44:35.220 --> 00:44:37.020]   - Right, Andy, you were gonna say it?
[00:44:37.020 --> 00:44:40.140]   - No, I was just gonna say that Penny Arcade, the webcom,
[00:44:40.140 --> 00:44:42.220]   we had a really great strip a few days ago,
[00:44:42.220 --> 00:44:44.380]   which the two leads are sort of arguing about gaming,
[00:44:44.380 --> 00:44:48.460]   but consoles are never gonna take over for,
[00:44:48.460 --> 00:44:51.780]   a take over, excuse me, that mobile devices
[00:44:51.780 --> 00:44:53.580]   are never gonna take over from consoles.
[00:44:53.580 --> 00:44:55.500]   I mean, you don't wanna play a game on your phone.
[00:44:55.500 --> 00:44:58.220]   I just got the comparing like a really big, epic game
[00:44:58.220 --> 00:45:00.540]   that you can get on console versus little,
[00:45:00.540 --> 00:45:03.020]   well, your game is about like popping balloons.
[00:45:03.020 --> 00:45:06.820]   And then the kicker is like, the guy with the iPhone says,
[00:45:06.820 --> 00:45:09.980]   "Yeah, tell you what, I'll take 50,
[00:45:09.980 --> 00:45:14.060]   "you buy a $50 game, I'll buy 50, 99 cent games.
[00:45:14.060 --> 00:45:16.140]   "Let's see which one of us is still having fun
[00:45:16.140 --> 00:45:16.980]   "a month from now."
[00:45:16.980 --> 00:45:18.300]   (laughing)
[00:45:18.300 --> 00:45:19.100]   And that really is it.
[00:45:19.100 --> 00:45:21.060]   - Yeah, and I don't find very many games
[00:45:21.060 --> 00:45:22.780]   that I'm that excited about very often.
[00:45:22.780 --> 00:45:24.220]   It's just that the ones that I do find
[00:45:24.220 --> 00:45:25.700]   are painfully addicting.
[00:45:25.700 --> 00:45:28.060]   Now, one thing we, it doesn't look like we are gonna see
[00:45:28.060 --> 00:45:31.420]   is any kind of "I" tunes, quote unquote replay.
[00:45:31.420 --> 00:45:34.020]   And it looks like this is still something
[00:45:34.020 --> 00:45:36.500]   that Apple is trying to move, move down the path,
[00:45:36.500 --> 00:45:39.780]   cloud with cloud movies and being able to stream into it.
[00:45:39.780 --> 00:45:42.620]   And right now it looks like the big hold up is HBO
[00:45:42.620 --> 00:45:46.500]   because it has a lot of its contracts and so on and so forth
[00:45:46.500 --> 00:45:48.620]   that are kind of tying up the market.
[00:45:48.620 --> 00:45:50.100]   Clayton, do you think it's really HBO
[00:45:50.100 --> 00:45:53.240]   that is holding back Apple from getting this process?
[00:45:53.240 --> 00:45:55.980]   - It's hard to say, but I think a lot of those content
[00:45:55.980 --> 00:45:57.740]   providers, they have licensed deals, right,
[00:45:57.740 --> 00:45:59.300]   that they lock up for a number of years
[00:45:59.300 --> 00:46:02.660]   and it's probably very difficult in those times
[00:46:02.660 --> 00:46:04.980]   when they're locking up those deals to be forward thinking
[00:46:04.980 --> 00:46:07.100]   and to think, now how is the marketplace
[00:46:07.100 --> 00:46:08.340]   gonna look five years from now?
[00:46:08.340 --> 00:46:13.340]   Are we, can we bring in, let's call one of the psychic ladies
[00:46:13.340 --> 00:46:15.300]   down the street and get on the 900 number
[00:46:15.300 --> 00:46:19.300]   and see if we can predict the digital experience
[00:46:19.300 --> 00:46:21.300]   five years from now to know that we're gonna have
[00:46:21.300 --> 00:46:23.900]   this dramatic shift from DVDs by mail
[00:46:23.900 --> 00:46:26.940]   to streaming movies by mail.
[00:46:26.940 --> 00:46:30.300]   So I think that HBO though has always historically
[00:46:30.300 --> 00:46:32.860]   had all of the, that's been a big problem
[00:46:32.860 --> 00:46:35.140]   for a lot of those other premium cable providers,
[00:46:35.140 --> 00:46:37.540]   the show times, the stars who have never been able
[00:46:37.540 --> 00:46:40.260]   to get those top tier movies 'cause HBO always had them.
[00:46:40.260 --> 00:46:42.740]   - Well, and now isn't kind of, that's how Netflix
[00:46:42.740 --> 00:46:45.500]   kind of got into this though, was making a deal with stars.
[00:46:45.500 --> 00:46:47.940]   So that was, there was kind of a loophole
[00:46:47.940 --> 00:46:50.220]   in the way stars contracts were about how it handled
[00:46:50.220 --> 00:46:53.500]   distribution and so we saw a lot of when Netflix
[00:46:53.500 --> 00:46:56.380]   started doing streaming, they were using,
[00:46:56.380 --> 00:46:58.540]   a lot of that you can see the stars open
[00:46:58.540 --> 00:46:59.940]   and everything else.
[00:46:59.940 --> 00:47:02.540]   Andy, do you think that, do you think Apple's gonna get
[00:47:02.540 --> 00:47:05.500]   a cloud service for streaming?
[00:47:05.500 --> 00:47:07.060]   - I think they're gonna get it eventually
[00:47:07.060 --> 00:47:09.140]   because they know who they're competing against,
[00:47:09.140 --> 00:47:11.940]   they all said it looked cards they're already holding.
[00:47:11.940 --> 00:47:15.700]   It's, they're cable companies that are looking at plans
[00:47:15.700 --> 00:47:18.060]   to throttle the bandwidth of their subscribers access
[00:47:18.060 --> 00:47:20.220]   to Netflix, they're not really thinking about
[00:47:20.220 --> 00:47:21.940]   throttling their access to iTunes
[00:47:21.940 --> 00:47:24.100]   and that really tells the whole tale, I think.
[00:47:24.100 --> 00:47:25.420]   - Right, I mean, that's interesting.
[00:47:25.420 --> 00:47:27.260]   And I think that holds the key, I think Andy's right.
[00:47:27.260 --> 00:47:30.700]   I mean, and also I think that Apple probably is aware
[00:47:30.700 --> 00:47:32.980]   of what's missing from the Netflix experience, right?
[00:47:32.980 --> 00:47:34.540]   You have Amazon on demand, but what's missing
[00:47:34.540 --> 00:47:37.580]   from that Netflix experience, the streaming experience anyway,
[00:47:37.580 --> 00:47:39.340]   is first run movies.
[00:47:39.340 --> 00:47:42.300]   When I can go to the grocery store and I see in Redbox
[00:47:42.300 --> 00:47:45.540]   that the newest movies are out and available right there,
[00:47:45.540 --> 00:47:46.860]   Hangover 2 is right there.
[00:47:46.860 --> 00:47:49.580]   The why can't I have access to it in a service
[00:47:49.580 --> 00:47:51.540]   that I'm paying $7.99 a month for?
[00:47:51.540 --> 00:47:53.820]   And instead I have to wait for the DVD to arrive
[00:47:53.820 --> 00:47:55.100]   and Netflix simply doesn't have that.
[00:47:55.100 --> 00:47:57.700]   If iTunes can lock up that component,
[00:47:57.700 --> 00:47:59.940]   maybe that's the golden ticket.
[00:47:59.940 --> 00:48:02.940]   - Now do you think, do you think that eventually Apple
[00:48:02.940 --> 00:48:05.660]   decides to play the big card and purchase some
[00:48:05.660 --> 00:48:08.340]   of these companies to solve some of those issues?
[00:48:08.340 --> 00:48:10.100]   They've got the cash, they could purchase all of them
[00:48:10.100 --> 00:48:11.460]   if they wanted to.
[00:48:11.460 --> 00:48:13.460]   Do you think that they ever go down that path?
[00:48:13.460 --> 00:48:14.860]   I'm just saying, okay, we're tired of waiting
[00:48:14.860 --> 00:48:17.020]   and now we're just gonna buy Time Warner
[00:48:17.020 --> 00:48:20.620]   or we're gonna buy, not maybe not Time Warner,
[00:48:20.620 --> 00:48:22.660]   but buy some of these large movie companies
[00:48:22.660 --> 00:48:24.180]   for $7 billion, $10 billion.
[00:48:24.180 --> 00:48:28.060]   I mean that barely shows up on Apple's financials.
[00:48:28.060 --> 00:48:29.900]   - I'm not sure that they would want everything
[00:48:29.900 --> 00:48:31.460]   that would come with the movie industry,
[00:48:31.460 --> 00:48:33.900]   the movie business, all they really want is the catalog.
[00:48:33.900 --> 00:48:36.300]   They don't want all the executives,
[00:48:36.300 --> 00:48:38.940]   their $80,000 leather sofas that they have to have
[00:48:38.940 --> 00:48:43.300]   in their offices and they never wanna argue with Keanu Reeves
[00:48:43.300 --> 00:48:46.500]   about his deal for Bill and Ted III.
[00:48:46.500 --> 00:48:47.640]   Either directly or indirectly,
[00:48:47.640 --> 00:48:48.480]   so I don't feel like that.
[00:48:48.480 --> 00:48:49.980]   - That would be a great argument, I would love to.
[00:48:49.980 --> 00:48:51.460]   (laughs)
[00:48:51.460 --> 00:48:54.900]   - So anyway, so we'll see how that turns out.
[00:48:54.900 --> 00:48:56.700]   Now I thought this map was kinda interesting,
[00:48:56.700 --> 00:49:00.420]   this was from the unofficial Apple web log.
[00:49:00.420 --> 00:49:03.940]   The map that shows states trending
[00:49:03.940 --> 00:49:06.180]   towards iOS versus Android.
[00:49:06.180 --> 00:49:07.420]   So evidently some states of course
[00:49:07.420 --> 00:49:10.780]   are more likely to get Android versus iOS
[00:49:10.780 --> 00:49:12.460]   and here we have the breakdown.
[00:49:12.460 --> 00:49:14.460]   I don't know what to make of this.
[00:49:14.460 --> 00:49:16.420]   Of course instead of being red states or blue states,
[00:49:16.420 --> 00:49:18.340]   there's still blue states.
[00:49:18.340 --> 00:49:21.380]   But are iOS users really blue users?
[00:49:21.380 --> 00:49:22.580]   I think that's really the question there.
[00:49:22.580 --> 00:49:24.820]   So what I thought was interesting was
[00:49:24.820 --> 00:49:27.180]   were states that were trending for blackberry.
[00:49:27.180 --> 00:49:28.420]   I mean I think some of them make sense.
[00:49:28.420 --> 00:49:32.020]   New York, Virginia, obviously those are good
[00:49:32.020 --> 00:49:33.500]   government over business.
[00:49:33.500 --> 00:49:35.460]   Of course I was looking at South Dakota, North Dakota,
[00:49:35.460 --> 00:49:36.420]   I was like really?
[00:49:36.420 --> 00:49:38.180]   So why is blackberry?
[00:49:38.180 --> 00:49:39.100]   - There's still two of those?
[00:49:39.100 --> 00:49:40.580]   Wow. (laughs)
[00:49:40.580 --> 00:49:41.420]   Exactly.
[00:49:41.420 --> 00:49:42.420]   - Kansas. - That's curved.
[00:49:42.420 --> 00:49:43.420]   (laughs)
[00:49:43.420 --> 00:49:48.340]   - Evidently blackberry is also very, very popular in Kansas.
[00:49:48.340 --> 00:49:51.540]   So anyway, so it's an interesting map to see.
[00:49:51.540 --> 00:49:52.980]   Now I think some of them make sense.
[00:49:52.980 --> 00:49:54.300]   I think when you look at California
[00:49:54.300 --> 00:49:57.020]   being a little bit geekier, Pennsylvania,
[00:49:57.020 --> 00:49:59.340]   my alma mater, I think there's a lot of geeks.
[00:49:59.340 --> 00:50:02.020]   There's a lot of research schools and so on and so forth.
[00:50:02.020 --> 00:50:05.100]   So I could see that trending one direction or another.
[00:50:05.100 --> 00:50:07.420]   But anyway, I thought that that was kind of
[00:50:07.420 --> 00:50:09.860]   an interesting breakdown of,
[00:50:09.860 --> 00:50:13.820]   now Andy, do you think there is a certain personality
[00:50:13.820 --> 00:50:15.140]   that would go along with the state,
[00:50:15.140 --> 00:50:17.700]   that would have someone go Android versus iOS
[00:50:17.700 --> 00:50:19.980]   or do you think this is just kind of a random process?
[00:50:19.980 --> 00:50:21.460]   - I think this is, I think this is kind of random.
[00:50:21.460 --> 00:50:25.900]   Realize that the thing that really puts all these
[00:50:25.900 --> 00:50:30.900]   colored states into relief is that if there is 1% more
[00:50:30.900 --> 00:50:34.140]   on one side than the other, that means that entire state
[00:50:34.140 --> 00:50:37.220]   gets colored in red or yellow or purple or whatever,
[00:50:37.220 --> 00:50:38.820]   it really doesn't say that, okay, well I mean,
[00:50:38.820 --> 00:50:42.820]   there's pretty much close approximation between the two.
[00:50:42.820 --> 00:50:44.100]   There's one that's a little bit more popular,
[00:50:44.100 --> 00:50:45.780]   but we'll never figure out why.
[00:50:45.780 --> 00:50:48.980]   Although I do think that the fact that the Virginia area
[00:50:48.980 --> 00:50:51.780]   is a blackberry stronghold, that's one state
[00:50:51.780 --> 00:50:54.180]   which you can say, okay, I can sort of see a correlation.
[00:50:54.180 --> 00:50:55.740]   - Well, and I love to see this per county.
[00:50:55.740 --> 00:50:56.860]   You know, like this is fine,
[00:50:56.860 --> 00:50:58.140]   I don't know how you do this per county,
[00:50:58.140 --> 00:51:00.300]   but I think that it's a much more interesting,
[00:51:00.300 --> 00:51:02.820]   like I find that political maps are much more interesting
[00:51:02.820 --> 00:51:05.380]   when you see them per precinct because it gives you
[00:51:05.380 --> 00:51:07.660]   a much more accurate view than just red, blue, or state
[00:51:07.660 --> 00:51:09.540]   or red state or blue state.
[00:51:09.540 --> 00:51:13.300]   So, and also the interesting way it over a map of networks too
[00:51:13.300 --> 00:51:15.740]   and to find out where network penetration is as well.
[00:51:15.740 --> 00:51:17.940]   I mean, looking at the Northeast corridor too
[00:51:17.940 --> 00:51:20.660]   up through Vermont where, I mean, again,
[00:51:20.660 --> 00:51:22.540]   I'd probably you can get a cell signal up there.
[00:51:22.540 --> 00:51:27.300]   So that they have that AT&T or at least now up till Verizon,
[00:51:27.300 --> 00:51:29.820]   but that mostly it was iOS through that region.
[00:51:29.820 --> 00:51:32.300]   I have to imagine it's probably not everyone
[00:51:32.300 --> 00:51:34.100]   that ran out and just picked up a Verizon iPhone
[00:51:34.100 --> 00:51:35.340]   in the past few months.
[00:51:35.340 --> 00:51:38.460]   - Right. Also, we shouldn't, we should never ignore the fact
[00:51:38.460 --> 00:51:40.540]   that for a great many people in the country,
[00:51:40.540 --> 00:51:43.620]   rushing out and spending $249 for an iPhone
[00:51:43.620 --> 00:51:46.580]   as opposed to a free with contract Android phone,
[00:51:46.580 --> 00:51:48.140]   that's a very big thing.
[00:51:48.140 --> 00:51:48.980]   - That's a good point.
[00:51:48.980 --> 00:51:50.620]   They're not really doing it from a technological point,
[00:51:50.620 --> 00:51:53.020]   it's really more of a financial issue.
[00:51:53.020 --> 00:51:53.860]   - Yeah.
[00:51:53.860 --> 00:51:54.700]   - Yeah.
[00:51:54.700 --> 00:51:57.980]   - So now Bloomberg is, they have posted a hypothetical iPhone 5
[00:51:57.980 --> 00:52:00.900]   with 512 megabytes of RAM.
[00:52:00.900 --> 00:52:03.820]   So they, you know, this is what I call getting serious.
[00:52:03.820 --> 00:52:05.340]   Andy, Andy's a...
[00:52:05.340 --> 00:52:06.620]   - What a scoop.
[00:52:06.620 --> 00:52:08.700]   They're, we've got the first one with details
[00:52:08.700 --> 00:52:11.420]   about the iPhone 5 that we have a hypothetical.
[00:52:11.420 --> 00:52:13.860]   - I have a hypothetical post also coming out.
[00:52:13.860 --> 00:52:15.660]   It has a thousand different features.
[00:52:15.660 --> 00:52:17.620]   You're not gonna believe this.
[00:52:17.620 --> 00:52:18.620]   - It works great in your head.
[00:52:18.620 --> 00:52:19.460]   Is that the...
[00:52:19.460 --> 00:52:20.300]   - Yeah.
[00:52:20.300 --> 00:52:21.300]   - Oh, it works fantastic in my head.
[00:52:21.300 --> 00:52:23.700]   - Right. Yeah. So the, so here's the breakdown
[00:52:23.700 --> 00:52:27.180]   of your iPhone 5, you know, their guesses
[00:52:27.180 --> 00:52:28.260]   if it goes down this path.
[00:52:28.260 --> 00:52:30.940]   And they included, of course, in this hypothetical.
[00:52:30.940 --> 00:52:31.940]   Not only is it hypothetical,
[00:52:31.940 --> 00:52:33.780]   but they have shipping, packaging, logistics,
[00:52:33.780 --> 00:52:34.940]   manufacturing, testing costs.
[00:52:34.940 --> 00:52:36.740]   And a lot of these are, you know,
[00:52:36.740 --> 00:52:38.420]   they're using some kind of,
[00:52:38.420 --> 00:52:40.420]   there's a table there that somebody's using.
[00:52:40.420 --> 00:52:42.180]   You know, they've got a table.
[00:52:42.180 --> 00:52:43.020]   I know they have a table here.
[00:52:43.020 --> 00:52:43.860]   - It's like those like those specials
[00:52:43.860 --> 00:52:45.620]   on the History Channel where what if,
[00:52:45.620 --> 00:52:47.780]   what if the Nazis got the atomic bomb
[00:52:47.780 --> 00:52:49.060]   and they won World War Two?
[00:52:49.060 --> 00:52:52.700]   We think that the 2012 presidential election
[00:52:52.700 --> 00:52:54.140]   would go something like this.
[00:52:54.140 --> 00:52:55.700]   (laughing)
[00:52:55.700 --> 00:52:58.180]   - So if you're wondering what the hypothetical cost
[00:52:58.180 --> 00:53:01.540]   of a hypothetical phone is, $270.10,
[00:53:01.540 --> 00:53:03.260]   which is probably, you know, Apple, you know,
[00:53:03.260 --> 00:53:06.700]   there have been a lot of estimates of cost in the past
[00:53:06.700 --> 00:53:08.140]   that have put the iPhone, you know,
[00:53:08.140 --> 00:53:10.100]   anywhere from $250 to $350.
[00:53:10.100 --> 00:53:12.180]   So they're probably somewhere in the ballpark of,
[00:53:12.180 --> 00:53:13.900]   of what that, what that is.
[00:53:13.900 --> 00:53:17.980]   Now, is that a lot of margin or is that pretty average margin?
[00:53:17.980 --> 00:53:20.100]   Andy, do you think that that's a reasonable margin?
[00:53:20.100 --> 00:53:22.580]   Or do you think that Apple has the ability,
[00:53:22.580 --> 00:53:25.420]   if they want to, to make it less expensive?
[00:53:25.420 --> 00:53:27.900]   - I think historically Apple has always,
[00:53:27.900 --> 00:53:29.540]   they've always figured out what is the price
[00:53:29.540 --> 00:53:31.180]   that we need to charge for this product?
[00:53:31.180 --> 00:53:33.340]   What price is the market gonna bear?
[00:53:33.340 --> 00:53:36.020]   And then they do every subsequent release
[00:53:36.020 --> 00:53:37.860]   based around that price.
[00:53:37.860 --> 00:53:39.700]   And this affects iPhone, this is,
[00:53:39.700 --> 00:53:43.060]   this affects desktop Max, this affects mobile Max.
[00:53:43.060 --> 00:53:47.100]   They are, they will never create a $799 MacBook.
[00:53:47.100 --> 00:53:50.140]   They will always create a $999 MacBook.
[00:53:50.140 --> 00:53:53.220]   That's better than the one they sold last year for $999.
[00:53:53.220 --> 00:53:55.100]   - So we'll see how that turns out.
[00:53:55.100 --> 00:53:56.900]   Coming up next, we're gonna be talking about Lion
[00:53:56.900 --> 00:53:59.180]   and Lawsuits, coming right,
[00:53:59.180 --> 00:54:02.420]   there's a lot of both on the way, unfortunately,
[00:54:02.420 --> 00:54:03.860]   and unfortunately.
[00:54:03.860 --> 00:54:04.860]   But before we get to that,
[00:54:04.860 --> 00:54:06.300]   we're gonna thank one of our sponsors.
[00:54:06.300 --> 00:54:07.580]   This episode of Mac Break Weekly
[00:54:07.580 --> 00:54:10.020]   is also brought to you by Carbonite.
[00:54:10.020 --> 00:54:15.020]   This is, the reality is, is that you really have to make sure
[00:54:15.020 --> 00:54:19.180]   that your files are not only on your computer,
[00:54:19.180 --> 00:54:20.300]   especially just on your computer.
[00:54:20.300 --> 00:54:21.700]   But even if you're gonna back up to a drive,
[00:54:21.700 --> 00:54:24.340]   what happens if you have, if someone breaks in,
[00:54:24.340 --> 00:54:27.140]   what happens if you have water damage or fire damage?
[00:54:27.140 --> 00:54:29.740]   These are the things, these are oftentimes your family photos,
[00:54:29.740 --> 00:54:32.140]   your family videos.
[00:54:32.140 --> 00:54:34.340]   And I know that it's a priority for me
[00:54:34.340 --> 00:54:36.660]   when it comes down to those photos that I shot
[00:54:36.660 --> 00:54:38.860]   over the last weekend, literally within minutes.
[00:54:38.860 --> 00:54:41.580]   I've got it off my computer,
[00:54:41.580 --> 00:54:42.420]   and definitely within a day,
[00:54:42.420 --> 00:54:44.140]   I've got them off my computer and into the cloud somewhere,
[00:54:44.140 --> 00:54:47.060]   because it's something that I need to,
[00:54:47.060 --> 00:54:49.620]   I just don't trust it to only be on my home computer.
[00:54:49.620 --> 00:54:51.980]   And that's what Carbonite does for you.
[00:54:51.980 --> 00:54:53.340]   It, of course, it's safe.
[00:54:53.340 --> 00:54:55.180]   Your files are encrypted before they leave the computer.
[00:54:55.180 --> 00:54:58.460]   So you're not, no one's picking up the stream on the way out.
[00:54:58.460 --> 00:55:00.540]   It's easy to use, you don't really,
[00:55:00.540 --> 00:55:01.740]   you don't have to be an expert.
[00:55:01.740 --> 00:55:03.300]   You just turn it on and make it work.
[00:55:03.300 --> 00:55:05.740]   It's automatic, so you can make sure that you can,
[00:55:05.740 --> 00:55:07.740]   you just set up the process.
[00:55:07.740 --> 00:55:09.380]   You set up, this is how I want it to work,
[00:55:09.380 --> 00:55:10.780]   and this is how often I want it to work.
[00:55:10.780 --> 00:55:14.860]   And you can make it, it'll start doing that automatically.
[00:55:14.860 --> 00:55:15.780]   So you don't have to think about it,
[00:55:15.780 --> 00:55:17.660]   because it's not a backup process
[00:55:17.660 --> 00:55:19.580]   if you have to remember to do it.
[00:55:19.580 --> 00:55:21.900]   If you have to do it manually,
[00:55:21.900 --> 00:55:23.420]   that's not really a backup process.
[00:55:23.420 --> 00:55:24.980]   It has to be something that is just happening
[00:55:24.980 --> 00:55:26.460]   in the background.
[00:55:26.460 --> 00:55:27.620]   And of course, you can get your files back
[00:55:27.620 --> 00:55:30.420]   in just a couple of clips, just a few clicks.
[00:55:30.420 --> 00:55:32.460]   And because you're offsite now,
[00:55:32.460 --> 00:55:34.660]   any computer that you have, you can get those files.
[00:55:34.660 --> 00:55:39.420]   So not only are they safer, but they're easier to get to.
[00:55:39.420 --> 00:55:41.700]   So if you need to get to those files
[00:55:41.700 --> 00:55:44.380]   in somewhere else away from your computer,
[00:55:44.380 --> 00:55:47.140]   those most important files are still available to you
[00:55:47.140 --> 00:55:49.100]   on any computer that you can log into.
[00:55:49.100 --> 00:55:51.980]   Now you can get this unlimited backup for your PC or Mac
[00:55:51.980 --> 00:55:54.340]   for only $59 a year.
[00:55:54.340 --> 00:55:55.700]   That's 16 cents a day.
[00:55:55.700 --> 00:55:57.380]   So anything on that computer,
[00:55:57.380 --> 00:55:59.500]   you're gonna be able to backup automatically,
[00:55:59.500 --> 00:56:01.500]   and it doesn't matter how big it is.
[00:56:01.500 --> 00:56:04.580]   So definitely check that out.
[00:56:04.580 --> 00:56:06.740]   So you can try it for free if you go to carbonite.com
[00:56:06.740 --> 00:56:10.060]   and enter the offer code Mac break,
[00:56:10.060 --> 00:56:11.420]   you can go ahead and give it a shot,
[00:56:11.420 --> 00:56:13.660]   put stuff up there, see whether it works for you,
[00:56:13.660 --> 00:56:16.500]   whether it's easy enough for you to actually get it working.
[00:56:16.500 --> 00:56:18.860]   I think you're gonna find that it's pretty darn easy.
[00:56:18.860 --> 00:56:21.500]   You don't need a credit card for the free trial.
[00:56:21.500 --> 00:56:24.140]   So you can sign up and you can get a free trial
[00:56:24.140 --> 00:56:26.180]   for two months.
[00:56:26.180 --> 00:56:31.180]   So go to carbonite.com and then use the offer code Mac break
[00:56:31.180 --> 00:56:36.140]   to try it out and see if carbonite is the one for you.
[00:56:36.140 --> 00:56:37.700]   But whether they're the one or not,
[00:56:37.700 --> 00:56:38.820]   you have to get on the cloud.
[00:56:38.820 --> 00:56:41.980]   And I would definitely suggest spending two months
[00:56:41.980 --> 00:56:43.980]   seeing if carbonite is the right one for you.
[00:56:43.980 --> 00:56:46.060]   All right, so now we have Lion.
[00:56:46.060 --> 00:56:49.460]   NVIDIA drivers are blowing up evidently
[00:56:49.460 --> 00:56:52.580]   on 2010 MacBook Pro owners.
[00:56:52.580 --> 00:56:55.220]   Andy, is this something people should pay attention to
[00:56:55.220 --> 00:56:56.940]   before they upgrade to Lion?
[00:56:56.940 --> 00:56:58.460]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:56:58.460 --> 00:57:01.700]   Anybody who has NVIDIA graphics on their desk,
[00:57:01.700 --> 00:57:04.180]   excuse me, on their Macs should definitely pay attention
[00:57:04.180 --> 00:57:07.460]   to this, not only for Mac books, but also for iMacs
[00:57:07.460 --> 00:57:10.460]   because the support forums started to fill up with,
[00:57:10.460 --> 00:57:12.500]   hey, every time I play a YouTube video,
[00:57:12.500 --> 00:57:14.180]   my system completely locks up.
[00:57:14.180 --> 00:57:17.100]   And those reports started hitting exactly the date
[00:57:17.100 --> 00:57:18.700]   that Lion started becoming available.
[00:57:18.700 --> 00:57:21.820]   Now, you know, one thing I will say is that I saw that
[00:57:21.820 --> 00:57:26.380]   and I actually, I'm actually having that lock up problem
[00:57:26.380 --> 00:57:29.700]   on YouTube without Lion on computers that I haven't upgraded.
[00:57:29.700 --> 00:57:32.300]   You know, there's something going on in that process
[00:57:32.300 --> 00:57:34.700]   that I don't think is completely connected to Lion.
[00:57:34.700 --> 00:57:40.500]   But there's either an update that's been made to flash,
[00:57:40.500 --> 00:57:42.460]   there's either a change that's been made to the driver,
[00:57:42.460 --> 00:57:43.740]   there's something going on.
[00:57:43.740 --> 00:57:46.140]   I've only seen a couple of different workarounds
[00:57:46.140 --> 00:57:49.580]   and the only one that's worthwhile is go back to Snow Leopard
[00:57:49.580 --> 00:57:51.340]   until this whole thing cools down.
[00:57:51.340 --> 00:57:55.700]   There are a couple of command line things that someone
[00:57:55.700 --> 00:58:00.660]   has dug up that seems to have mitigated it a little bit,
[00:58:00.660 --> 00:58:02.500]   but none of them are as good as just simply saying,
[00:58:02.500 --> 00:58:05.420]   okay, there's an issue with this model of graphics hardware,
[00:58:05.420 --> 00:58:06.780]   so definitely downgrade.
[00:58:06.780 --> 00:58:08.820]   - And these are some of the pretty serious,
[00:58:08.820 --> 00:58:10.500]   it's not just YouTube not working very well.
[00:58:10.500 --> 00:58:12.100]   We're talking about kernel panics,
[00:58:12.100 --> 00:58:14.060]   the screen suddenly going black and the inability
[00:58:14.060 --> 00:58:16.100]   to wait from sleep, which interestingly enough
[00:58:16.100 --> 00:58:18.180]   was an early problem in Snow Leopard as well.
[00:58:18.180 --> 00:58:20.500]   This was not, I mean, a lot of these machines,
[00:58:20.500 --> 00:58:21.780]   it seems like this is an old bug
[00:58:21.780 --> 00:58:23.620]   that somehow repropigated itself.
[00:58:23.620 --> 00:58:26.460]   - What was interesting too is that a lot of people
[00:58:26.460 --> 00:58:28.780]   were complaining that this was in the developer builds
[00:58:28.780 --> 00:58:30.620]   and people were seeing that on those machines
[00:58:30.620 --> 00:58:32.820]   as it was coming out and they assumed,
[00:58:32.820 --> 00:58:35.940]   they assumed rather erroneously, I guess,
[00:58:35.940 --> 00:58:37.620]   that this would be cleaned up in time
[00:58:37.620 --> 00:58:39.540]   when it actually shipped, it hasn't.
[00:58:39.540 --> 00:58:41.300]   And of course, according to this piece at least,
[00:58:41.300 --> 00:58:44.340]   in ours, Technica, there's an update in the AppleCare support.
[00:58:44.340 --> 00:58:48.100]   Well, one of the technicians has said that one of the workarounds
[00:58:48.100 --> 00:58:52.500]   is to go to the library preferences and look for any,
[00:58:52.500 --> 00:58:55.380]   delete any files that have Windows Server in there
[00:58:55.380 --> 00:58:57.220]   and then reboot the machine.
[00:58:57.220 --> 00:58:58.900]   And apparently that's supposed to fix it.
[00:58:58.900 --> 00:59:00.860]   I know someone who had this happen and did that
[00:59:00.860 --> 00:59:03.460]   and it worked, so I don't know that that's a good way
[00:59:03.460 --> 00:59:05.940]   to fix it across the board, especially if this is a problem,
[00:59:05.940 --> 00:59:08.100]   if it was there and before we ever saw a line
[00:59:08.100 --> 00:59:09.380]   and it was in Snow Leopard.
[00:59:09.380 --> 00:59:11.580]   - Right, yeah, so it's interesting to see,
[00:59:11.580 --> 00:59:12.820]   well, we'll see how that turns out.
[00:59:12.820 --> 00:59:15.460]   I know that this is just a reminder
[00:59:15.460 --> 00:59:18.260]   that it is always a good idea to upgrade slowly.
[00:59:18.260 --> 00:59:20.940]   I know that I have a couple machines that have line on it
[00:59:20.940 --> 00:59:23.140]   that we're noodling with and it's awesome
[00:59:23.140 --> 00:59:24.700]   and we're really enjoying it,
[00:59:24.700 --> 00:59:26.900]   but it's not something that we're putting on every machine
[00:59:26.900 --> 00:59:28.060]   all at once.
[00:59:28.060 --> 00:59:29.940]   And it's this kind of stuff that we just went,
[00:59:29.940 --> 00:59:31.940]   well, we'll just kind of dip our toe in.
[00:59:31.940 --> 00:59:33.180]   Just because Apple has upgraded,
[00:59:33.180 --> 00:59:35.140]   it doesn't mean that you have to dive into it
[00:59:35.140 --> 00:59:36.420]   and upgrade it on all your machines.
[00:59:36.420 --> 00:59:38.180]   I think you wanna be kind of careful
[00:59:38.180 --> 00:59:40.100]   and let a lot of this stuff sort itself out
[00:59:40.100 --> 00:59:42.820]   before you necessarily jump in.
[00:59:42.820 --> 00:59:45.900]   So now, if you are upgrading,
[00:59:45.900 --> 00:59:47.620]   one of the things that people have complained about
[00:59:47.620 --> 00:59:51.940]   is that because you're downloading it on the App Store,
[00:59:51.940 --> 00:59:54.140]   that there's no way to get that USB key.
[00:59:54.140 --> 00:59:56.140]   Now, it turns out that Apple has been saying
[00:59:56.140 --> 00:59:56.980]   that they've been giving,
[00:59:56.980 --> 01:00:01.140]   or there's been talk about them giving away USB keys for this,
[01:00:01.140 --> 01:00:04.220]   but it turns out they've just released this week,
[01:00:04.220 --> 01:00:09.220]   I think yesterday, Apple's Lion Recovery Disc Assistant,
[01:00:09.420 --> 01:00:13.260]   which will allow you to create a recovery partition
[01:00:13.260 --> 01:00:15.100]   on an external drive in the case
[01:00:15.100 --> 01:00:16.740]   that you might have a crash.
[01:00:16.740 --> 01:00:18.820]   Andy, have you tried this?
[01:00:18.820 --> 01:00:21.100]   Yep, I tried it, I created a USB,
[01:00:21.100 --> 01:00:23.900]   it's great because it works on an external drive,
[01:00:23.900 --> 01:00:25.460]   so it works on USB keys.
[01:00:25.460 --> 01:00:27.020]   It'll work on pretty much anything.
[01:00:27.020 --> 01:00:30.060]   I've got the big, as all three of us know,
[01:00:30.060 --> 01:00:32.340]   that you get all these press releases and stuff
[01:00:32.340 --> 01:00:35.060]   on USB keys now, they're one gigabyte.
[01:00:35.060 --> 01:00:37.660]   And so now I just simply went into my kitchen drawer,
[01:00:37.660 --> 01:00:39.860]   got one of the 700 out there,
[01:00:39.860 --> 01:00:42.460]   and quickly converted it into a bootable partition.
[01:00:42.460 --> 01:00:43.980]   How big does it have to be?
[01:00:43.980 --> 01:00:46.460]   Only one gigabyte, doesn't have to be the full whack,
[01:00:46.460 --> 01:00:48.260]   six gigabyte line install.
[01:00:48.260 --> 01:00:49.340]   The only thing I haven't tried,
[01:00:49.340 --> 01:00:50.700]   only because I haven't gotten around to it yet,
[01:00:50.700 --> 01:00:54.260]   is to see if you can install it on an SD card.
[01:00:54.260 --> 01:00:57.380]   I'm not sure if there'd be any impediment to that working,
[01:00:57.380 --> 01:00:59.540]   I know that you can boot off an SD card,
[01:00:59.540 --> 01:01:00.580]   if it's big enough.
[01:01:00.580 --> 01:01:01.940]   So I just haven't gotten around to trying it yet,
[01:01:01.940 --> 01:01:03.020]   but yeah, it works just fine,
[01:01:03.020 --> 01:01:06.180]   just you reboot just exactly the same way you would,
[01:01:06.180 --> 01:01:07.620]   in any other case.
[01:01:07.620 --> 01:01:10.260]   This is definitely though a very much of a worst case scenario,
[01:01:10.260 --> 01:01:13.060]   because the only reason why you would ever actually need this,
[01:01:13.060 --> 01:01:15.940]   would be if you actually had physical damage
[01:01:15.940 --> 01:01:18.140]   to your hard drive that took the whole drive out.
[01:01:18.140 --> 01:01:20.700]   Also, if you have the newest Macs,
[01:01:20.700 --> 01:01:22.780]   like the newest MacBook Airs,
[01:01:22.780 --> 01:01:25.140]   Apple does have a net boot option
[01:01:25.140 --> 01:01:27.620]   where you can actually mount a recovery partition
[01:01:27.620 --> 01:01:29.740]   from Apple servers over Wi-Fi.
[01:01:29.740 --> 01:01:31.900]   That was a third option that's only available
[01:01:31.900 --> 01:01:35.700]   on the new Macs and presumably future Macs after that.
[01:01:35.700 --> 01:01:37.700]   And there was a clamor for this, I'm glad they have it now.
[01:01:37.700 --> 01:01:39.500]   And there was a kind of a crazy workaround
[01:01:39.500 --> 01:01:40.780]   that you could go in,
[01:01:40.780 --> 01:01:43.060]   if you wanted to get your line partition,
[01:01:43.060 --> 01:01:44.700]   there was this kind of way to get it installed,
[01:01:44.700 --> 01:01:46.540]   but not install it and get a hold of that file
[01:01:46.540 --> 01:01:47.500]   and put it somewhere else.
[01:01:47.500 --> 01:01:50.020]   And this kind of eliminates a lot of that,
[01:01:50.020 --> 01:01:51.820]   or is it just another process?
[01:01:51.820 --> 01:01:54.620]   You still might want to get that whole installer out.
[01:01:54.620 --> 01:01:56.740]   Right, there are a couple of problems with that workaround.
[01:01:56.740 --> 01:02:01.060]   One that was a much bigger file than one gigabyte.
[01:02:01.060 --> 01:02:04.140]   Secondly, it was that DMG file,
[01:02:04.140 --> 01:02:05.540]   that secret DMG file, I believe,
[01:02:05.540 --> 01:02:07.460]   was only in the installer file
[01:02:07.460 --> 01:02:10.180]   that will disappear as soon as the installation was done.
[01:02:10.180 --> 01:02:12.180]   So you had sort of a narrow window to make it.
[01:02:12.180 --> 01:02:15.340]   This one is you download this app at your leisure.
[01:02:15.340 --> 01:02:18.100]   You go through a discrete number of very simple steps,
[01:02:18.100 --> 01:02:20.660]   you just plug in any drive and it simply works.
[01:02:20.660 --> 01:02:23.260]   The only real disadvantage is that you can't take,
[01:02:23.260 --> 01:02:24.740]   like if you've got an external hard drive,
[01:02:24.740 --> 01:02:26.660]   you've been using just as like an aperture
[01:02:26.660 --> 01:02:28.780]   or an iPhoto photo library when you travel,
[01:02:28.780 --> 01:02:29.620]   you can't just simply say,
[01:02:29.620 --> 01:02:32.740]   "Oh, that's great, I'll just now drop a recovery partition
[01:02:32.740 --> 01:02:34.660]   "there so it will be not only for my photo storage,
[01:02:34.660 --> 01:02:36.220]   "it'll also be my recovery drive."
[01:02:36.220 --> 01:02:37.980]   That's not gonna work because the first thing it does
[01:02:37.980 --> 01:02:40.500]   is it wipes out the external drive.
[01:02:40.500 --> 01:02:42.740]   So clearly this is targeted towards USB keys
[01:02:42.740 --> 01:02:46.860]   and not towards a way to resource that 500 gigabyte hard drive
[01:02:46.860 --> 01:02:49.100]   that you took out of your old machine a year ago.
[01:02:49.100 --> 01:02:50.940]   Now I will say that this is actually one of the first things
[01:02:50.940 --> 01:02:52.540]   that I would, I mean, I always have some way
[01:02:52.540 --> 01:02:53.980]   that I'm gonna be able to reboot.
[01:02:53.980 --> 01:02:55.180]   If you're, if you're, if you're,
[01:02:55.180 --> 01:02:56.820]   whether it's upgrading the line or anything else,
[01:02:56.820 --> 01:02:58.300]   you always should have this in your bag
[01:02:58.300 --> 01:02:59.620]   as some way to, you know,
[01:02:59.620 --> 01:03:01.220]   'cause it's not just, if there's physical damage,
[01:03:01.220 --> 01:03:05.180]   but if for some reason you toast your, you know,
[01:03:05.180 --> 01:03:07.620]   some, something that it's using to do a restart
[01:03:07.620 --> 01:03:10.260]   and you need to go back and look at that driver,
[01:03:10.260 --> 01:03:11.820]   do, you know, do something to clean up,
[01:03:11.820 --> 01:03:13.580]   use the disk utility or whatever to clean,
[01:03:13.580 --> 01:03:15.100]   clean it up so that they can restart again.
[01:03:15.100 --> 01:03:16.500]   If I can't find the drive.
[01:03:16.500 --> 01:03:19.860]   Because, because I mean, think about the worst,
[01:03:19.860 --> 01:03:21.540]   the worst case scenarios which do happen.
[01:03:21.540 --> 01:03:23.260]   I've mentioned, I mentioned this a few times
[01:03:23.260 --> 01:03:24.140]   over the past couple of years,
[01:03:24.140 --> 01:03:26.180]   that first day of back world Expo one week,
[01:03:26.180 --> 01:03:28.580]   I totally toasted my hard drive.
[01:03:28.580 --> 01:03:29.420]   I was there.
[01:03:29.420 --> 01:03:31.100]   Yep, exactly again.
[01:03:31.100 --> 01:03:34.260]   And I was able to get a machine up and running later that day
[01:03:34.260 --> 01:03:36.620]   by virtue of the fact that I was able to run across the street
[01:03:36.620 --> 01:03:37.620]   by a hard drive.
[01:03:37.620 --> 01:03:39.340]   I was able to locate friends,
[01:03:39.340 --> 01:03:44.180]   our Scott Borne was able to find me a copy of the OS.
[01:03:44.180 --> 01:03:47.020]   I was able to grab copies of this and that.
[01:03:47.020 --> 01:03:49.500]   God bless living in 2011 and having a Mac.
[01:03:49.500 --> 01:03:51.100]   If you have this little USB key,
[01:03:51.100 --> 01:03:53.340]   I'll still have to run out and buy myself a hard drive.
[01:03:53.340 --> 01:03:55.860]   But it means that I first boot off the USB key
[01:03:55.860 --> 01:03:57.740]   and then that will get my machine bootable,
[01:03:57.740 --> 01:03:59.660]   that will get me connected to the App Store,
[01:03:59.660 --> 01:04:01.860]   that will get me a new download of Lion,
[01:04:01.860 --> 01:04:03.900]   which will get me a new download of all the apps
[01:04:03.900 --> 01:04:04.940]   I've ever purchased.
[01:04:04.940 --> 01:04:06.100]   And although my documents,
[01:04:06.100 --> 01:04:08.500]   I'm still gonna have to connect to Dropbox to get those,
[01:04:08.500 --> 01:04:11.700]   but the idea of getting an up and running machine
[01:04:11.700 --> 01:04:13.940]   that has all the services that I used to have
[01:04:13.940 --> 01:04:15.380]   before I did that silly thing,
[01:04:15.380 --> 01:04:19.060]   such as try to drag my Mac towards me on a table,
[01:04:19.060 --> 01:04:20.500]   while it was still booting up.
[01:04:20.500 --> 01:04:22.820]   I can second have things up and running again.
[01:04:22.820 --> 01:04:25.460]   This is like living on the Oregon Trail, dysentery.
[01:04:25.460 --> 01:04:27.860]   You never know what you're gonna find out there on the trail.
[01:04:27.860 --> 01:04:29.340]   (laughing)
[01:04:29.340 --> 01:04:30.180]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:04:30.180 --> 01:04:33.340]   So, well, especially with SSD being more common,
[01:04:33.340 --> 01:04:35.140]   much more common now on a lot of the Macs, obviously,
[01:04:35.140 --> 01:04:38.300]   in the new errors and even the iMacs,
[01:04:38.300 --> 01:04:42.980]   and having the operating system booting off of the SSD,
[01:04:42.980 --> 01:04:45.020]   very little risk to Andy's point
[01:04:45.020 --> 01:04:46.620]   about being a worst case scenario.
[01:04:46.620 --> 01:04:47.420]   I didn't even bother.
[01:04:47.420 --> 01:04:50.220]   I upgraded my iMac, had no problems,
[01:04:50.220 --> 01:04:52.980]   and then had less of a fear about just upgrading
[01:04:52.980 --> 01:04:55.460]   my MacBook Air work flawlessly.
[01:04:55.460 --> 01:04:58.300]   So, it's even if I have a smaller hard drive
[01:04:58.300 --> 01:05:01.380]   in my laptop, between my Air and my 17,
[01:05:01.380 --> 01:05:03.580]   it's still got the spinning drive.
[01:05:03.580 --> 01:05:06.900]   And when it starts up, it's just like,
[01:05:06.900 --> 01:05:07.900]   are you kidding me?
[01:05:07.900 --> 01:05:10.220]   You know, just like, I just feel like I'm just sitting there.
[01:05:10.220 --> 01:05:11.540]   I'm gonna go have a cup of coffee.
[01:05:11.540 --> 01:05:12.740]   I'm gonna go to Starbucks and back.
[01:05:12.740 --> 01:05:13.820]   I mean, it's just gonna be like,
[01:05:13.820 --> 01:05:15.660]   it's gonna take that long for it to settle down,
[01:05:15.660 --> 01:05:17.060]   because it's gonna start up,
[01:05:17.060 --> 01:05:19.180]   and then it's gonna slowly start putting these other things
[01:05:19.180 --> 01:05:20.700]   in, opening these other things up,
[01:05:20.700 --> 01:05:22.700]   and I'm gonna listen to the little hard drive spinning around,
[01:05:22.700 --> 01:05:24.060]   and nothing's gonna work right until,
[01:05:24.060 --> 01:05:26.060]   for, you know, they say it's a minute and a half,
[01:05:26.060 --> 01:05:27.620]   or whatever, but it's really like four or five minutes
[01:05:27.620 --> 01:05:28.980]   before it's really usable.
[01:05:28.980 --> 01:05:31.700]   And with your-- - Do you think they can
[01:05:31.700 --> 01:05:34.220]   have a hard drive is a lot like the rotary telephone?
[01:05:34.220 --> 01:05:35.900]   It's gonna be one of those dividing lines
[01:05:35.900 --> 01:05:36.740]   between generation.
[01:05:36.740 --> 01:05:38.540]   Wow, you mean that you could,
[01:05:38.540 --> 01:05:40.980]   you actually had to stop and wait for a light
[01:05:40.980 --> 01:05:43.260]   to like, start go to sleep before it was safe to--
[01:05:43.260 --> 01:05:44.100]   - Wow! - Wow!
[01:05:44.100 --> 01:05:46.780]   - So get this, get this, yeah, they're used to have,
[01:05:46.780 --> 01:05:48.540]   they used to have the data on these things
[01:05:48.540 --> 01:05:50.340]   that would actually spin.
[01:05:50.340 --> 01:05:53.020]   It was a, it was a crazy experience, you know,
[01:05:53.020 --> 01:05:55.180]   and they'd have to, they'd spin really, really fast,
[01:05:55.180 --> 01:05:57.700]   and you'd sometimes pay more because they spun faster
[01:05:57.700 --> 01:05:59.460]   than the other ones, and yeah, that's--
[01:05:59.460 --> 01:06:01.100]   - And there used to be a woman at a call center
[01:06:01.100 --> 01:06:03.260]   that was attractive, that used to plug in
[01:06:03.260 --> 01:06:05.180]   the different phone to the, yes,
[01:06:05.180 --> 01:06:06.940]   I'd like to reach K19 please.
[01:06:06.940 --> 01:06:08.820]   - Exactly. - All right, we'll take,
[01:06:08.820 --> 01:06:09.980]   there you go.
[01:06:09.980 --> 01:06:12.180]   And they were both very popular in the last century.
[01:06:12.180 --> 01:06:13.500]   - So-- - You go all over LA
[01:06:13.500 --> 01:06:15.220]   on the red car for a nickel.
[01:06:15.220 --> 01:06:16.740]   (laughing)
[01:06:16.740 --> 01:06:18.420]   - So also moving into the future,
[01:06:18.420 --> 01:06:21.900]   Skype 5.3 has just been released with Lion Support
[01:06:21.900 --> 01:06:25.380]   in HD video calls, either of you tried HD video calls?
[01:06:25.380 --> 01:06:27.060]   - No way in hell.
[01:06:27.060 --> 01:06:29.260]   - I think I just-- (laughing)
[01:06:29.260 --> 01:06:30.780]   - I mean, I-- - That's weird stuff.
[01:06:30.780 --> 01:06:32.260]   Now you can have a-- - I'm still running Skype
[01:06:32.260 --> 01:06:33.620]   7.20P definition.
[01:06:33.620 --> 01:06:38.300]   - I'm still running, I mean, look, I never,
[01:06:38.300 --> 01:06:41.700]   I'm so scared of upgrading Skype on any of my machines.
[01:06:41.700 --> 01:06:42.940]   I just don't do it anymore.
[01:06:42.940 --> 01:06:45.100]   I mean, I quickly close out of those windows
[01:06:45.100 --> 01:06:45.940]   when there's an update.
[01:06:45.940 --> 01:06:48.580]   I say don't remind me again about an update.
[01:06:48.580 --> 01:06:50.100]   I had a downgrade.
[01:06:50.100 --> 01:06:55.100]   I have one PC that I record when we do our Daddy on board show
[01:06:55.100 --> 01:06:58.220]   because I need VOD burner to be able to record video calls.
[01:06:58.220 --> 01:07:01.660]   And that's the only, and I had to downgrade back to 4.2.
[01:07:01.660 --> 01:07:03.540]   I got five off of all my machines
[01:07:03.540 --> 01:07:04.580]   because it was just terrible.
[01:07:04.580 --> 01:07:06.060]   And I'm not upgrading anytime soon.
[01:07:06.060 --> 01:07:09.180]   So I'm still running Skype 4.2 on all my machines
[01:07:09.180 --> 01:07:10.980]   and I don't plan on upgrading anytime soon.
[01:07:10.980 --> 01:07:12.860]   - I'm still on 2.8 on this machine.
[01:07:12.860 --> 01:07:16.180]   - You know, and it's hard to go bang.
[01:07:16.180 --> 01:07:19.700]   I mean, so 5.0 and above have really been
[01:07:19.700 --> 01:07:21.780]   a big step back, but once someone,
[01:07:21.780 --> 01:07:23.860]   we've had trouble integrating with people who,
[01:07:23.860 --> 01:07:26.100]   like if we can't, if everyone isn't in the,
[01:07:26.100 --> 01:07:28.060]   on some of the group calls that we've done,
[01:07:28.060 --> 01:07:30.660]   we've had trouble getting everybody in like a 2.8 comes in
[01:07:30.660 --> 01:07:33.620]   and it actually limits the number of people it seems like
[01:07:33.620 --> 01:07:34.460]   that you can log in.
[01:07:34.460 --> 01:07:37.060]   - I'm so sure the 2.8's have to ruin it for everyone.
[01:07:37.060 --> 01:07:38.620]   - No, but I mean, it's like, it's forcing people
[01:07:38.620 --> 01:07:39.980]   to basically upgrade.
[01:07:39.980 --> 01:07:42.380]   And so we, to get some of our other shows recorded,
[01:07:42.380 --> 01:07:43.700]   because like, Twit doesn't have this problem
[01:07:43.700 --> 01:07:46.180]   because they're doing, it's a different machine for everyone.
[01:07:46.180 --> 01:07:49.100]   But we've been doing ones where we have a big group discussion.
[01:07:49.100 --> 01:07:51.860]   And when we did that, it required, it just wouldn't,
[01:07:51.860 --> 01:07:52.860]   and it doesn't give you a warning,
[01:07:52.860 --> 01:07:54.300]   it just didn't do anything, it doesn't work.
[01:07:54.300 --> 01:07:57.460]   And then what we did is upgraded them all to 5.0,
[01:07:57.460 --> 01:08:00.300]   whatever, and it was horrible, but it actually worked.
[01:08:00.300 --> 01:08:02.660]   And we had to pay for it, to get video.
[01:08:02.660 --> 01:08:04.380]   If you want more than two people on video,
[01:08:04.380 --> 01:08:06.140]   you have to pay for it now.
[01:08:06.140 --> 01:08:09.220]   And we downloaded 5.3 today.
[01:08:09.220 --> 01:08:12.740]   One of the new things about this is in Snow leopard,
[01:08:12.740 --> 01:08:13.820]   this is not in line.
[01:08:13.820 --> 01:08:16.340]   But one of the new things is it can now see our AJA card.
[01:08:16.340 --> 01:08:18.660]   So it used to be, when we wanted to have,
[01:08:18.660 --> 01:08:21.820]   use our high-end video cards,
[01:08:21.820 --> 01:08:24.460]   we had to open it up in a viewer,
[01:08:24.460 --> 01:08:27.820]   and then we had to use a little thing called Cam Twist
[01:08:27.820 --> 01:08:30.260]   to see the viewer and then pass it on to Skype.
[01:08:30.260 --> 01:08:31.860]   And what I will say is that in the new one,
[01:08:31.860 --> 01:08:34.180]   it just, we had a drop-down menu,
[01:08:34.180 --> 01:08:38.740]   that just had all the AJA inputs for the, you know,
[01:08:38.740 --> 01:08:40.580]   for our inputs, you know, so we have a Kona card
[01:08:40.580 --> 01:08:42.660]   in one of our machines, and we were doing it this morning,
[01:08:42.660 --> 01:08:43.980]   actually, and we were all excited.
[01:08:43.980 --> 01:08:45.100]   We thought, oh, we're gonna get HD.
[01:08:45.100 --> 01:08:46.100]   No, it's not.
[01:08:46.100 --> 01:08:47.900]   It just squeezed the, it just squeezed it.
[01:08:47.900 --> 01:08:50.580]   It's, there's some kind of bug in 5.3 there,
[01:08:50.580 --> 01:08:53.060]   where it's not, it's basically grabbing onto those video cards
[01:08:53.060 --> 01:08:55.940]   before whatever settings you set for the video cards.
[01:08:55.940 --> 01:08:58.540]   And so it's, but it's definitely a step in that direction,
[01:08:58.540 --> 01:08:59.740]   which is gonna make our job easier.
[01:08:59.740 --> 01:09:02.140]   So it's, for us, it's worth upgrading.
[01:09:02.140 --> 01:09:05.620]   If you haven't missed it, man, I wouldn't bother.
[01:09:05.620 --> 01:09:09.260]   I find Skype 5 to be paid.
[01:09:09.260 --> 01:09:10.620]   - Have they fixed any of the throttling?
[01:09:10.620 --> 01:09:12.100]   I mean, what they were doing was you'd have,
[01:09:12.100 --> 01:09:13.500]   you'd have a high-definition video,
[01:09:13.500 --> 01:09:15.980]   you'd have somebody would be in widescreen,
[01:09:15.980 --> 01:09:17.660]   then right in the mid-call,
[01:09:17.660 --> 01:09:19.860]   somebody would be shifting back to fourth rate,
[01:09:19.860 --> 01:09:21.220]   then jumping back to 16.9,
[01:09:21.220 --> 01:09:22.740]   or whatever it was jumping back and forth
[01:09:22.740 --> 01:09:25.100]   in the middle of the call on a regular basis.
[01:09:25.100 --> 01:09:26.940]   So it made recording, you know,
[01:09:26.940 --> 01:09:29.660]   made recording or doing those things unusable.
[01:09:29.660 --> 01:09:30.700]   - Yeah, I haven't seen that yet.
[01:09:30.700 --> 01:09:33.060]   So we haven't gotten it working yet for the,
[01:09:33.060 --> 01:09:36.260]   you know, with the HD yet on our computer.
[01:09:36.260 --> 01:09:37.460]   So we'll have to see all the codes.
[01:09:37.460 --> 01:09:39.900]   Andy, have you played with the new Skype at all?
[01:09:39.900 --> 01:09:40.740]   - No.
[01:09:40.740 --> 01:09:42.140]   (laughing)
[01:09:42.140 --> 01:09:46.300]   - Skype is the app that every time I use it,
[01:09:46.300 --> 01:09:47.940]   it has to work.
[01:09:47.940 --> 01:09:51.220]   It's the difference between starting within 15 minutes
[01:09:51.220 --> 01:09:53.060]   of the time that I agreed to talk to somebody
[01:09:53.060 --> 01:09:55.060]   and starting within sometime that day.
[01:09:55.060 --> 01:09:55.900]   - Right.
[01:09:55.900 --> 01:09:59.580]   - So I do have the new Skype on other machines.
[01:09:59.580 --> 01:10:00.660]   It works, I'm sorry, rather,
[01:10:00.660 --> 01:10:03.580]   the previous version of this one on machines.
[01:10:03.580 --> 01:10:06.860]   It works fine, but on this machine right here,
[01:10:06.860 --> 01:10:09.340]   and given that I'm in like a room that's designed
[01:10:09.340 --> 01:10:11.620]   to be a studio just for podcasting,
[01:10:11.620 --> 01:10:13.500]   and just for videos, and just for Skype,
[01:10:13.500 --> 01:10:16.780]   it's like if, here's the decision tree.
[01:10:16.780 --> 01:10:18.740]   Is this version of Skype working?
[01:10:18.740 --> 01:10:19.580]   Yes.
[01:10:19.580 --> 01:10:20.820]   - End of decision tree.
[01:10:20.820 --> 01:10:21.660]   - Right.
[01:10:21.660 --> 01:10:22.500]   - We do not upgrade.
[01:10:22.500 --> 01:10:23.500]   It's working.
[01:10:23.500 --> 01:10:24.340]   - And isn't that their problem?
[01:10:24.340 --> 01:10:25.700]   I mean, that's one of the Skype's problems
[01:10:25.700 --> 01:10:26.940]   is they're trying to get everyone to move up,
[01:10:26.940 --> 01:10:29.020]   but no one wants to because A, they ruin the interface,
[01:10:29.020 --> 01:10:31.180]   and B, they started charging for some of the stuff
[01:10:31.180 --> 01:10:32.340]   we were getting for free,
[01:10:32.340 --> 01:10:34.340]   and C, it doesn't really work that well.
[01:10:34.340 --> 01:10:36.620]   So anyway, so that, not that we're bitter about.
[01:10:36.620 --> 01:10:38.660]   - Not that we're, I just hate that,
[01:10:38.660 --> 01:10:42.140]   I still hate the fact that I don't regard myself
[01:10:42.140 --> 01:10:44.140]   as an unusually dumb person.
[01:10:44.140 --> 01:10:45.140]   I'm not a smart person,
[01:10:45.140 --> 01:10:47.140]   I'm not an unusually dumb person.
[01:10:47.140 --> 01:10:50.460]   And when over my headphones, I hear somebody in the UK,
[01:10:50.460 --> 01:10:51.460]   so I'm supposed to be talking to you,
[01:10:51.460 --> 01:10:53.220]   "Okay, now I'll just send this video."
[01:10:53.220 --> 01:10:57.060]   And now there's just me looking at the screen like,
[01:10:57.060 --> 01:10:59.140]   "Okay, I don't push that."
[01:10:59.140 --> 01:11:00.940]   So this, no, it's not that many there.
[01:11:00.940 --> 01:11:02.500]   Well, it can't be this button, no, it's not that button.
[01:11:02.500 --> 01:11:03.940]   - But when I have to admit, the worst part,
[01:11:03.940 --> 01:11:05.780]   the worst part for this is that, you know,
[01:11:05.780 --> 01:11:08.780]   for a long time, I was like, "That's free,
[01:11:08.780 --> 01:11:09.940]   "you know, what are you gonna do?"
[01:11:09.940 --> 01:11:12.740]   And as soon as they forced me to put money down on it,
[01:11:12.740 --> 01:11:14.940]   it doesn't matter how much, but as soon as I had
[01:11:14.940 --> 01:11:18.060]   to give them a credit card, now I'm much more edgy about it.
[01:11:18.060 --> 01:11:20.380]   Okay, so I'm paying for this, and it doesn't work very well.
[01:11:20.380 --> 01:11:22.300]   And it doesn't matter how much they charge,
[01:11:22.300 --> 01:11:24.660]   that was the mistake, is going to something
[01:11:24.660 --> 01:11:27.020]   that it doesn't work, and then charging people for it.
[01:11:27.020 --> 01:11:30.660]   So now we have to get into these,
[01:11:30.660 --> 01:11:34.820]   this is the weekly, we need to create some kind of little,
[01:11:34.820 --> 01:11:38.260]   I don't, which is the lawsuits.
[01:11:38.260 --> 01:11:39.900]   There's always a lawsuit, Apple's suing somebody.
[01:11:39.900 --> 01:11:41.460]   - No, 'cause even that sound effect is,
[01:11:41.460 --> 01:11:44.020]   that sound effect is too exciting for this.
[01:11:44.020 --> 01:11:46.380]   - Exactly, it's like, "I need to have Robert Vaughn
[01:11:46.380 --> 01:11:47.460]   "like do the intro."
[01:11:47.460 --> 01:11:50.140]   - You can write a piece of software.
[01:11:50.140 --> 01:11:51.620]   Are you being a tassel by lawyers?
[01:11:51.620 --> 01:11:54.500]   Don't let the settlement people push you around.
[01:11:54.500 --> 01:11:56.900]   - Exactly, so have you been injured in an accident?
[01:11:56.900 --> 01:11:58.260]   Call Morgan and Falstaff.
[01:11:58.260 --> 01:12:03.580]   - Well, and here's the craziness, so we have in 1999,
[01:12:03.580 --> 01:12:07.580]   so this is a lawsuit, this is a new one around fast booting
[01:12:07.580 --> 01:12:10.860]   in OS X, so it's the method that Apple is using
[01:12:10.860 --> 01:12:14.500]   or is purportedly using to boot up quickly,
[01:12:14.500 --> 01:12:17.540]   was originally, this process was originally
[01:12:17.540 --> 01:12:22.020]   filed back in 1999 by LG, but LG doesn't own this patent
[01:12:22.020 --> 01:12:27.020]   anymore, they pass that patent off to microconnect LLC,
[01:12:27.020 --> 01:12:29.820]   which is then passed that this patent off
[01:12:29.820 --> 01:12:34.580]   to operating systems solutions, OSS, which is probably
[01:12:34.580 --> 01:12:37.740]   can be at this point called a patent troll.
[01:12:37.740 --> 01:12:41.540]   And these guys are now suing Apple for this
[01:12:41.540 --> 01:12:43.660]   to see if they can't, to cash in.
[01:12:43.660 --> 01:12:47.260]   Clayton, do you think that they, this is gonna go anywhere?
[01:12:47.260 --> 01:12:50.460]   - I don't know, isn't it the tit for tat back and forth,
[01:12:50.460 --> 01:12:53.140]   back and forth that we constantly see with these things?
[01:12:53.140 --> 01:12:55.300]   I don't know if you happen to see Mark Cuban's post
[01:12:55.300 --> 01:12:58.340]   the other day over on his, on blog Maverick,
[01:12:58.340 --> 01:13:03.340]   his actual, his blog, where he was talking about
[01:13:03.340 --> 01:13:08.420]   getting rid of an end to all of the software patent problems,
[01:13:08.420 --> 01:13:11.980]   don't make them shorter, just eliminate them all together
[01:13:11.980 --> 01:13:14.140]   and try to cut down on some of the courtroom costs
[01:13:14.140 --> 01:13:16.220]   associated with the process and all of this.
[01:13:16.220 --> 01:13:18.540]   - But don't you think in some ways it could be,
[01:13:18.540 --> 01:13:21.140]   to me I understand someone who is developing a process,
[01:13:21.140 --> 01:13:24.220]   they've developed an idea and they should have some level
[01:13:24.220 --> 01:13:25.700]   of protection so they can take advantage of that,
[01:13:25.700 --> 01:13:27.020]   I mean that's what the patent system's around,
[01:13:27.020 --> 01:13:30.340]   but the question is whether people who aren't using
[01:13:30.340 --> 01:13:32.940]   the patent should be allowed, in my opinion the big thing,
[01:13:32.940 --> 01:13:35.260]   the mess that's being made right now,
[01:13:35.260 --> 01:13:37.780]   I mean I understand Apple suing Samsung
[01:13:37.780 --> 01:13:40.700]   or Samsung suing Apple and OKEA getting money from Apple
[01:13:40.700 --> 01:13:42.300]   because these are patents from a company
[01:13:42.300 --> 01:13:44.180]   that's actually using that technology,
[01:13:44.180 --> 01:13:45.820]   they patent it for their own use,
[01:13:45.820 --> 01:13:47.180]   someone else is using it and they're saying,
[01:13:47.180 --> 01:13:50.540]   "Hey, we wanna, this was our right to do that."
[01:13:50.540 --> 01:13:51.820]   I think it's a completely different thing
[01:13:51.820 --> 01:13:53.580]   to have companies that are simply buying up patents
[01:13:53.580 --> 01:13:55.540]   and suing people for them.
[01:13:55.540 --> 01:13:58.140]   - I mean does that mean, I think you're right about that.
[01:13:58.140 --> 01:14:00.260]   - That's really, yeah you can show somebody,
[01:14:00.260 --> 01:14:01.980]   you can say, "Hey, we're actually using this,
[01:14:01.980 --> 01:14:03.420]   "we're using it on a consistent basis,
[01:14:03.420 --> 01:14:05.300]   "this is what's making our company better,
[01:14:05.300 --> 01:14:07.140]   "we're making money because we're using
[01:14:07.140 --> 01:14:09.380]   "this particular process that we came up with."
[01:14:09.380 --> 01:14:11.820]   But I think Mark Cuban's point is look that
[01:14:11.820 --> 01:14:13.580]   that's not how companies get better, right,
[01:14:13.580 --> 01:14:16.060]   that companies get better not because they're just
[01:14:16.060 --> 01:14:17.500]   holding on to these processes,
[01:14:17.500 --> 01:14:19.780]   you can't just create this process and sit back
[01:14:19.780 --> 01:14:21.980]   with a cigar in the recliner and,
[01:14:21.980 --> 01:14:23.660]   "Ah, I'm just sitting on this process,
[01:14:23.660 --> 01:14:25.260]   "well, while we're not even using it,
[01:14:25.260 --> 01:14:28.020]   "we're just sitting here and we're trying to get patents
[01:14:28.020 --> 01:14:29.540]   "so that other people can't use them."
[01:14:29.540 --> 01:14:31.060]   - Exactly. - Right, yeah.
[01:14:31.060 --> 01:14:31.900]   So that's it.
[01:14:31.900 --> 01:14:34.860]   And Andy, do you think this LG is gonna go,
[01:14:34.860 --> 01:14:36.060]   this vast start?
[01:14:36.060 --> 01:14:36.900]   Now the other thing is,
[01:14:36.900 --> 01:14:38.100]   I don't know when they actually were awarded it,
[01:14:38.100 --> 01:14:39.580]   they filed it back in 1999.
[01:14:39.580 --> 01:14:46.060]   So it's kind of midway through its progression as a patent.
[01:14:46.060 --> 01:14:47.060]   Do you think that, you know,
[01:14:47.060 --> 01:14:49.540]   do you think Apple's just gonna end up settling?
[01:14:49.540 --> 01:14:52.380]   - I really don't. - Send them a check.
[01:14:52.380 --> 01:14:55.260]   - Yeah, I mean, I would like to speculate,
[01:14:55.260 --> 01:14:56.580]   but when it comes to legal matters,
[01:14:56.580 --> 01:14:58.780]   I feel so I don't even know enough to speculate.
[01:14:58.780 --> 01:15:01.860]   I mean, it really does make me sad that,
[01:15:01.860 --> 01:15:04.780]   I've got that little database of people that I call
[01:15:04.780 --> 01:15:05.860]   when I don't understand something,
[01:15:05.860 --> 01:15:07.900]   but this person works in this sort of field
[01:15:07.900 --> 01:15:09.060]   time and time again.
[01:15:09.060 --> 01:15:11.940]   And it just depresses me that I have two or three names now
[01:15:11.940 --> 01:15:14.740]   of people who work in IP, who know about,
[01:15:14.740 --> 01:15:17.540]   who either work in this sort of field
[01:15:17.540 --> 01:15:19.580]   or they're intrinsically,
[01:15:20.620 --> 01:15:22.740]   they got money in this, so to speak.
[01:15:22.740 --> 01:15:23.940]   And so they have to know about it
[01:15:23.940 --> 01:15:25.220]   and that their time's gonna,
[01:15:25.220 --> 01:15:28.820]   it's sort of like the first time a news guy has to know that,
[01:15:28.820 --> 01:15:30.900]   okay, so now I have to learn,
[01:15:30.900 --> 01:15:33.700]   I'm expected to know about what three common household
[01:15:33.700 --> 01:15:35.580]   chemicals can be used to make a poison
[01:15:35.580 --> 01:15:38.180]   that can kill 10,000 people in a subway.
[01:15:38.180 --> 01:15:40.700]   God bless living in the future.
[01:15:40.700 --> 01:15:41.900]   - Right, yeah, so.
[01:15:41.900 --> 01:15:45.220]   - Now Apple is also trying to step in on the LODESIS case,
[01:15:45.220 --> 01:15:47.740]   and so LODESIS of course is trying to keep Apple out of it.
[01:15:47.740 --> 01:15:49.460]   So Apple, LODESIS has,
[01:15:49.460 --> 01:15:50.740]   Apple is trying to intervene and say,
[01:15:50.740 --> 01:15:53.620]   "Really, you should be having this argument with us."
[01:15:53.620 --> 01:15:55.460]   And that's like the big,
[01:15:55.460 --> 01:15:56.820]   that's like a kid bullying in the,
[01:15:56.820 --> 01:15:59.340]   and the seventh grader is bullying the sixth graders
[01:15:59.340 --> 01:16:00.180]   and then the,
[01:16:00.180 --> 01:16:01.900]   - Did I realize the,
[01:16:01.900 --> 01:16:03.700]   the senior walks in. - The senior walks in.
[01:16:03.700 --> 01:16:05.420]   - Yeah, the 12th grader friend comes in and goes,
[01:16:05.420 --> 01:16:07.300]   "Actually, if you're bothering them,
[01:16:07.300 --> 01:16:08.980]   "you should be talking to me."
[01:16:08.980 --> 01:16:10.180]   And they're like, "No, no, no, we shouldn't really
[01:16:10.180 --> 01:16:11.020]   "be talking to you.
[01:16:11.020 --> 01:16:13.180]   "We should still stick with the sixth graders."
[01:16:13.180 --> 01:16:16.460]   And so Apple is saying, "No, we should be part of this,
[01:16:16.460 --> 01:16:18.700]   "we should be able to intervene.
[01:16:18.700 --> 01:16:20.180]   "This should be a conversation between LODESIS.
[01:16:20.180 --> 01:16:22.260]   "We've already licensed this.
[01:16:22.260 --> 01:16:24.220]   "LODESIS is trying to keep them out.
[01:16:24.220 --> 01:16:26.180]   "And I guess we're gonna find out more
[01:16:26.180 --> 01:16:27.260]   "in the next week or two.
[01:16:27.260 --> 01:16:28.700]   "Clayton, do you think that LODESIS
[01:16:28.700 --> 01:16:31.300]   "is gonna be able to keep Apple out of this conversation?"
[01:16:31.300 --> 01:16:32.260]   - I don't think so at all.
[01:16:32.260 --> 01:16:35.140]   I think they were in theta-W, during WWDC,
[01:16:35.140 --> 01:16:35.980]   that it was,
[01:16:35.980 --> 01:16:37.580]   it was exactly what you were saying.
[01:16:37.580 --> 01:16:39.780]   Hey, come on, pick on someone your own size.
[01:16:39.780 --> 01:16:40.620]   - Right.
[01:16:40.620 --> 01:16:42.140]   - And by your own size, you're not gonna find it,
[01:16:42.140 --> 01:16:43.940]   but we're much bigger than you.
[01:16:43.940 --> 01:16:45.660]   So come talk to us.
[01:16:45.660 --> 01:16:46.500]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:16:46.500 --> 01:16:47.340]   - So there's no way that they're gonna stay out of this
[01:16:47.340 --> 01:16:48.180]   conversation.
[01:16:48.180 --> 01:16:49.300]   - I've already been emphatic about it.
[01:16:49.300 --> 01:16:51.380]   - Well, and this is not one that Apple's gonna settle either.
[01:16:51.380 --> 01:16:53.180]   This is one of those ones that they're gonna,
[01:16:53.180 --> 01:16:56.900]   I would guess that the legal team is going to wanna make
[01:16:56.900 --> 01:16:58.420]   a point out of this one
[01:16:58.420 --> 01:17:01.140]   and really push into LODESIS pretty hard.
[01:17:01.140 --> 01:17:03.380]   - Yeah, and also that I think the small developers,
[01:17:03.380 --> 01:17:05.180]   bigger, biggest friends at this point,
[01:17:05.180 --> 01:17:06.660]   is not necessarily Apple,
[01:17:06.660 --> 01:17:09.660]   but it's the large developers who have made public rumblings
[01:17:09.660 --> 01:17:10.820]   that said that look,
[01:17:10.820 --> 01:17:12.500]   we're not gonna bother investing millions
[01:17:12.500 --> 01:17:13.660]   and developing this app.
[01:17:13.660 --> 01:17:15.060]   That only is gonna make us a target
[01:17:15.060 --> 01:17:16.500]   for these patent rules.
[01:17:16.500 --> 01:17:19.220]   I think that Apple already had an interest
[01:17:19.220 --> 01:17:22.420]   in defending developers against LODESIS,
[01:17:22.420 --> 01:17:23.660]   but when it started to become,
[01:17:23.660 --> 01:17:25.140]   this is going to make our platform
[01:17:25.140 --> 01:17:27.140]   less attractive to develop for,
[01:17:27.140 --> 01:17:29.460]   that really kicked it way up the food change
[01:17:29.460 --> 01:17:30.820]   and turned it into a,
[01:17:30.820 --> 01:17:33.140]   well, let's see if we can find a solution to this is.
[01:17:33.140 --> 01:17:35.220]   Okay, remember that scene from "Lord of the Rings?"
[01:17:35.220 --> 01:17:37.620]   where all the trolls had armor fused to their bodies?
[01:17:37.620 --> 01:17:39.340]   We're gonna be doing that only with lawyers.
[01:17:39.340 --> 01:17:40.180]   - Thank you.
[01:17:40.180 --> 01:17:42.420]   So we'll see how it turns out.
[01:17:42.420 --> 01:17:45.780]   And as I said, my whole thing is,
[01:17:45.780 --> 01:17:50.140]   that I think that if people are suing people over patents,
[01:17:50.140 --> 01:17:52.940]   I mean, I think it's fine for Nokia to sue Apple for patents.
[01:17:52.940 --> 01:17:55.460]   My mind thing that irritates me the most
[01:17:55.460 --> 01:17:57.700]   is dealing with companies that their only job
[01:17:57.700 --> 01:17:58.780]   is to sue people for patents.
[01:17:58.780 --> 01:17:59.620]   - Yeah.
[01:17:59.620 --> 01:18:02.220]   - You know, that's the patent rule process.
[01:18:02.220 --> 01:18:03.540]   - That's so annoying.
[01:18:03.540 --> 01:18:04.860]   - That's what my friends have been telling me,
[01:18:04.860 --> 01:18:06.660]   that in any industry,
[01:18:06.660 --> 01:18:08.820]   there are always those seminars you can,
[01:18:08.820 --> 01:18:10.820]   weekend seminars you can take at the Hilton
[01:18:10.820 --> 01:18:12.060]   that will teach you,
[01:18:12.060 --> 01:18:13.980]   well, there's this new way of doing a facelift
[01:18:13.980 --> 01:18:16.540]   that involves minimal surgery
[01:18:16.540 --> 01:18:21.540]   and this new sort of wire that you can only get in Albania.
[01:18:21.540 --> 01:18:23.620]   There are also now in the legal profession,
[01:18:23.620 --> 01:18:25.260]   here's the weekend seminar
[01:18:25.260 --> 01:18:26.820]   and how to become a patent role.
[01:18:26.820 --> 01:18:28.340]   It's very, very lucrative.
[01:18:28.340 --> 01:18:30.860]   Here's, it literally, it's like,
[01:18:30.860 --> 01:18:33.740]   just, it really is like any other business where,
[01:18:33.740 --> 01:18:36.220]   if you know that you can go to Asia,
[01:18:36.220 --> 01:18:38.660]   buy these devices for $43 each,
[01:18:38.660 --> 01:18:41.540]   take them back to America and sell them for $130 each,
[01:18:41.540 --> 01:18:42.860]   you can not only make money on that,
[01:18:42.860 --> 01:18:44.180]   you can also make money teaching people
[01:18:44.180 --> 01:18:45.860]   where to buy them how to run the business
[01:18:45.860 --> 01:18:47.340]   and there are people who are running the business saying,
[01:18:47.340 --> 01:18:49.780]   well, here's how you can expect to get cool.
[01:18:49.780 --> 01:18:51.460]   It's an easy three grand settlement.
[01:18:51.460 --> 01:18:53.180]   You know, yes, it costs you a lot of money
[01:18:53.180 --> 01:18:54.020]   if they go to court,
[01:18:54.020 --> 01:18:56.260]   but you can always make sure that you position it so,
[01:18:56.260 --> 01:18:58.180]   it will never be attractive and you'll see.
[01:18:58.180 --> 01:18:59.780]   - And eventually this is the end of,
[01:18:59.780 --> 01:19:03.780]   this is the end of the patent system as we know it
[01:19:03.780 --> 01:19:05.740]   because as this continues to propagate,
[01:19:05.740 --> 01:19:08.980]   they will have to, you know, it's a virus.
[01:19:08.980 --> 01:19:10.220]   You know, and so the thing is,
[01:19:10.220 --> 01:19:12.180]   they'll have to deal with it.
[01:19:12.180 --> 01:19:14.540]   - Yeah, you hear word out of the White House,
[01:19:14.540 --> 01:19:15.500]   you hear that that's something
[01:19:15.500 --> 01:19:17.060]   that they're considering doing, of course,
[01:19:17.060 --> 01:19:19.340]   but also as soon as you see in Andy's point,
[01:19:19.340 --> 01:19:22.380]   if you start to see Don LaPry
[01:19:22.380 --> 01:19:24.300]   doing overnight infomercials
[01:19:24.300 --> 01:19:26.580]   on how you can take out tiny classified ads.
[01:19:26.580 --> 01:19:28.220]   - Then you know, then you know you're there.
[01:19:28.220 --> 01:19:29.060]   - Right.
[01:19:29.060 --> 01:19:30.420]   - You've reached the mass market.
[01:19:30.420 --> 01:19:31.780]   Now we've got-- - I have a nice boat.
[01:19:31.780 --> 01:19:32.700]   Do you want one just like it?
[01:19:32.700 --> 01:19:33.620]   Take my seminar.
[01:19:33.620 --> 01:19:34.460]   - Yeah, exactly.
[01:19:34.460 --> 01:19:36.060]   - Now Clayton, do you have your pick for the week?
[01:19:36.060 --> 01:19:37.060]   - I do. - Okay, hold on.
[01:19:37.060 --> 01:19:37.900]   - Two, one, two, one.
[01:19:37.900 --> 01:19:38.740]   - Okay, we got one.
[01:19:38.740 --> 01:19:39.580]   It's coming towards you.
[01:19:39.580 --> 01:19:42.060]   I'm just warning you that we're coming your direction soon.
[01:19:42.060 --> 01:19:45.700]   We've got a tip for the week from Andy and I.
[01:19:45.700 --> 01:19:47.580]   We're gonna do some line in iOS tips
[01:19:47.580 --> 01:19:48.780]   and then we'll do picks of the week.
[01:19:48.780 --> 01:19:49.620]   But before we get there,
[01:19:49.620 --> 01:19:53.580]   we're gonna thank our sponsor Smile Software,
[01:19:53.580 --> 01:19:54.420]   or from Smile.
[01:19:54.420 --> 01:19:56.820]   And this is TextExpander.
[01:19:56.820 --> 01:19:58.820]   Andy, do you use TextExpander?
[01:19:58.820 --> 01:19:59.820]   - Yes, I do.
[01:19:59.820 --> 01:20:02.060]   And I've been using it actually now on iOS
[01:20:02.060 --> 01:20:03.300]   as well as on the desktop.
[01:20:03.300 --> 01:20:06.180]   I sort of switched over when I realized
[01:20:06.180 --> 01:20:09.740]   how valuable it is to not only just use it for,
[01:20:09.740 --> 01:20:11.940]   okay, I will read this and get back to you later
[01:20:11.940 --> 01:20:13.860]   when I have more time, sincerely yours,
[01:20:13.860 --> 01:20:15.580]   your close personal friend, Andy, not go.
[01:20:15.580 --> 01:20:16.420]   - Right.
[01:20:16.420 --> 01:20:17.860]   - It's actually, I realize that, oh,
[01:20:17.860 --> 01:20:19.300]   that means that when I'm doing markup,
[01:20:19.300 --> 01:20:21.460]   I can just simply, I keep forgetting the code
[01:20:21.460 --> 01:20:23.860]   that I need to insert to format an image properly
[01:20:23.860 --> 01:20:24.780]   in my WordPress.
[01:20:24.780 --> 01:20:26.660]   Okay, so if I just put it in TextExpander,
[01:20:26.660 --> 01:20:27.820]   I'll have to do it as members.
[01:20:27.820 --> 01:20:29.980]   Remember, these four keystrokes and it'll be formatted.
[01:20:29.980 --> 01:20:31.660]   - Right, and of course, Smile makes a lot of software.
[01:20:31.660 --> 01:20:33.860]   They make PDF pen, PDF pen pro.
[01:20:33.860 --> 01:20:35.620]   But they also make TextExpander,
[01:20:35.620 --> 01:20:37.460]   which I use all the time for, like, for instance,
[01:20:37.460 --> 01:20:38.740]   if I'm doing, you know, like,
[01:20:38.740 --> 01:20:40.700]   if I want to review a product or I want, you know,
[01:20:40.700 --> 01:20:42.780]   there's this, hi, I'd like to review your product
[01:20:42.780 --> 01:20:45.340]   and then I type in this little code and it goes,
[01:20:45.340 --> 01:20:46.940]   my name is Alex Lindsey and this is what I've done
[01:20:46.940 --> 01:20:49.820]   and this is, you know, like, this is all the little thing.
[01:20:49.820 --> 01:20:51.340]   - That one kind of terrifies me
[01:20:51.340 --> 01:20:54.300]   because the first time that I get a reply back saying,
[01:20:54.300 --> 01:20:59.140]   hi, yeah, actually, we're a, we do a network service,
[01:20:59.140 --> 01:21:00.420]   we don't have actual hardware,
[01:21:00.420 --> 01:21:01.980]   so we can't ship you anything.
[01:21:01.980 --> 01:21:02.900]   - Damn it, I'm sorry.
[01:21:02.900 --> 01:21:05.100]   I'm a cot using a boiler plate, I'm sorry.
[01:21:05.100 --> 01:21:06.020]   (laughing)
[01:21:06.020 --> 01:21:08.020]   - No, it just isn't a live, it's just a bi-evolution.
[01:21:08.020 --> 01:21:10.420]   - I tried to get a higher level than this and so on.
[01:21:10.420 --> 01:21:13.940]   - It's just a bio, it's a bio information, you know,
[01:21:13.940 --> 01:21:17.380]   the basic stuff that is there and then, of course,
[01:21:17.380 --> 01:21:19.020]   people, when I send out links to stuff,
[01:21:19.020 --> 01:21:21.140]   so for instance, my FTP, there's certain links
[01:21:21.140 --> 01:21:22.860]   that all have to come before, whatever the name is
[01:21:22.860 --> 01:21:24.860]   and so now I can just, I just type in a code,
[01:21:24.860 --> 01:21:27.180]   it pops out the entire string, so I don't have to remember it
[01:21:27.180 --> 01:21:29.220]   and then I just type in the last little file name.
[01:21:29.220 --> 01:21:32.380]   If I'm sending out responses, those types of things
[01:21:32.380 --> 01:21:34.500]   are definitely things that, you know,
[01:21:34.500 --> 01:21:35.660]   I like to start them with that.
[01:21:35.660 --> 01:21:38.020]   I then customize them, of course,
[01:21:38.020 --> 01:21:40.620]   but the ability to handle all those signatures,
[01:21:40.620 --> 01:21:43.940]   put emails in, stuff that you have to put in,
[01:21:43.940 --> 01:21:46.260]   that's standard, but you don't necessarily want to put it
[01:21:46.260 --> 01:21:48.860]   in the footer of your email, but you can also, of course,
[01:21:48.860 --> 01:21:50.260]   use this in lots of different places,
[01:21:50.260 --> 01:21:52.900]   you can use it in documents, you want to add your address
[01:21:52.900 --> 01:21:55.380]   to certain things and you just want to have a short,
[01:21:55.380 --> 01:21:56.860]   you know, little code that you can type in
[01:21:56.860 --> 01:21:59.620]   and have it all pop in, that's all Texas Expanded Works
[01:21:59.620 --> 01:22:02.660]   and it's just, once you have it on your computer,
[01:22:02.660 --> 01:22:04.580]   I don't really customize my software,
[01:22:04.580 --> 01:22:07.260]   my computer's very often because I'm a,
[01:22:07.260 --> 01:22:08.380]   well, afraid I'll go to another computer
[01:22:08.380 --> 01:22:11.260]   and it won't be there and then I'll be sad.
[01:22:11.260 --> 01:22:12.660]   And so I don't do that very often,
[01:22:12.660 --> 01:22:14.180]   but TextExpander is definitely one of the ones
[01:22:14.180 --> 01:22:17.300]   that I add to just about everything that I'm using
[01:22:17.300 --> 01:22:20.900]   'cause it just really takes hours out of the week
[01:22:20.900 --> 01:22:23.460]   as you start, if you have to send out a lot of emails.
[01:22:23.460 --> 01:22:25.180]   And so it just fills those all in,
[01:22:25.180 --> 01:22:27.100]   you can have text, graphics, you know,
[01:22:27.100 --> 01:22:28.700]   all of those things can be added there,
[01:22:28.700 --> 01:22:32.220]   you can use even stuff like Tab, Return, Enter
[01:22:32.220 --> 01:22:35.420]   for your snippets and so you can even have,
[01:22:35.420 --> 01:22:37.780]   they have a support where you can actually
[01:22:37.780 --> 01:22:40.300]   run AppleScript and ShellScripts.
[01:22:40.300 --> 01:22:42.460]   Now I haven't gone that geeky yet,
[01:22:42.460 --> 01:22:45.020]   but I definitely wanna check that out.
[01:22:45.020 --> 01:22:46.340]   And of course you can use,
[01:22:46.340 --> 01:22:48.220]   well, you can have Dropbox support as built in
[01:22:48.220 --> 01:22:50.500]   so you can use Dropbox to sync your snippets
[01:22:50.500 --> 01:22:53.860]   between your Mac and they have new hotkey options
[01:22:53.860 --> 01:22:56.660]   for quickly creating, editing and finding snippets.
[01:22:56.660 --> 01:22:58.620]   So definitely check it out.
[01:22:58.620 --> 01:23:02.620]   It is 35 bucks and you can get a free demo
[01:23:02.620 --> 01:23:05.620]   at smilesoftware.com/macbreak.
[01:23:05.620 --> 01:23:08.660]   So what you wanna do is go to smilesoftware.com/macbreak
[01:23:08.660 --> 01:23:12.140]   and you can download this or many other demo versions
[01:23:12.140 --> 01:23:14.740]   of what they have there to try it out.
[01:23:14.740 --> 01:23:18.020]   And it is really, you know, and I think Don McAllister,
[01:23:18.020 --> 01:23:21.780]   if you go up to, I think he actually did the screencast
[01:23:21.780 --> 01:23:24.940]   for TextExpander, but it really is one of those things
[01:23:24.940 --> 01:23:27.580]   that you can squeeze out a lot of extra minutes.
[01:23:27.580 --> 01:23:29.020]   I know we're always trying to squeeze that out
[01:23:29.020 --> 01:23:30.380]   and TextExpander is a great way to do it.
[01:23:30.380 --> 01:23:33.940]   And once again, smilesoftware.com/macbreak.
[01:23:33.940 --> 01:23:37.020]   And now it's time for our tips of the week, Andy.
[01:23:37.020 --> 01:23:38.340]   Do you have a lion tip for the week?
[01:23:38.340 --> 01:23:40.900]   Other than always look them straight in the face.
[01:23:40.900 --> 01:23:42.620]   That's the thing with lions, you know, that's what I hear
[01:23:42.620 --> 01:23:44.540]   is that you just don't turn your back to them.
[01:23:44.540 --> 01:23:47.340]   And that's my lion tip for the...
[01:23:47.340 --> 01:23:49.500]   - Well, there feelings are hurt,
[01:23:49.500 --> 01:23:51.940]   but figure that, well, she's supposed to something like I said.
[01:23:51.940 --> 01:23:54.820]   And then it will lead to what happens after that?
[01:23:54.820 --> 01:23:56.940]   Low self-esteem and then what happened?
[01:23:56.940 --> 01:23:58.540]   Some sort of eating disorder.
[01:23:58.540 --> 01:24:01.460]   Oh, I was talking to a guy, I was actually talking to a guy
[01:24:01.460 --> 01:24:04.340]   in Tanzania and he said, just always face the lion
[01:24:04.340 --> 01:24:06.060]   and put your hands up because if you feel bigger,
[01:24:06.060 --> 01:24:07.260]   they'll just, they won't attack you.
[01:24:07.260 --> 01:24:08.340]   And I said, what if there's two lions?
[01:24:08.340 --> 01:24:10.140]   And he goes, you're dead.
[01:24:10.140 --> 01:24:12.380]   (laughing)
[01:24:12.380 --> 01:24:14.180]   So that's my lion tip for the week.
[01:24:14.180 --> 01:24:17.980]   But I'm sure that Andy has one that's probably more specific
[01:24:17.980 --> 01:24:19.340]   to our show.
[01:24:19.340 --> 01:24:20.940]   - Yes, there's a really cool little tweak
[01:24:20.940 --> 01:24:23.540]   that Apple's done to window resizing.
[01:24:23.540 --> 01:24:26.260]   You already know that if you want to resize a window,
[01:24:26.260 --> 01:24:29.900]   now every single edge is now essentially a grab bar
[01:24:29.900 --> 01:24:31.540]   to resize a window.
[01:24:31.540 --> 01:24:33.940]   If you move your pointer to one of the corners of the window,
[01:24:33.940 --> 01:24:36.340]   you'll see it'll change into an arrow showing you
[01:24:36.340 --> 01:24:39.220]   how you can now you make this shorter on the top edge.
[01:24:39.220 --> 01:24:42.020]   Or now you can make this actually narrow on this edge
[01:24:42.020 --> 01:24:43.500]   or narrow on this edge.
[01:24:43.500 --> 01:24:45.740]   I think you can figure out what happens on the bottom one,
[01:24:45.740 --> 01:24:47.740]   but I don't need to go into that right now.
[01:24:47.740 --> 01:24:49.420]   But there's an actual little nice little tweak.
[01:24:49.420 --> 01:24:51.940]   Hold down the option key while you do.
[01:24:51.940 --> 01:24:52.940]   That's a modification.
[01:24:52.940 --> 01:24:54.940]   So that will say, yes, you will change the height
[01:24:54.940 --> 01:24:57.700]   of this window, but it will change the height centered
[01:24:57.700 --> 01:24:59.420]   around the current center of the window.
[01:24:59.420 --> 01:25:04.220]   So if you drag it down, it won't just like move the top down,
[01:25:04.220 --> 01:25:06.020]   it will also move the bottom up.
[01:25:06.020 --> 01:25:10.140]   So the entire thing will resize based on where you are.
[01:25:10.140 --> 01:25:12.660]   Same thing for the size you basically moving the left
[01:25:12.660 --> 01:25:14.300]   and the right side in.
[01:25:14.300 --> 01:25:19.140]   And as you might guess, if you click into one of the corners,
[01:25:19.140 --> 01:25:21.380]   it will shrink down the entire window once again,
[01:25:21.380 --> 01:25:23.580]   both dimensions centered around where it is right now.
[01:25:23.580 --> 01:25:24.980]   Well, and that's one of the things that's really useful,
[01:25:24.980 --> 01:25:27.500]   because a lot of times what happens is you go from a big screen
[01:25:27.500 --> 01:25:29.860]   to a little screen in one of your windows is like way too big
[01:25:29.860 --> 01:25:32.260]   and you can't actually find any of the edges.
[01:25:32.260 --> 01:25:32.900]   Yeah.
[01:25:32.900 --> 01:25:37.100]   And there's actually sort of an associated tip with Safari
[01:25:37.100 --> 01:25:40.980]   that, man, I wish this applied to every single app.
[01:25:40.980 --> 01:25:44.900]   We all love the full screen version of these line apps.
[01:25:44.900 --> 01:25:48.180]   We get to just sort of focus on this one document everywhere.
[01:25:48.180 --> 01:25:50.820]   One problem though is that sometimes in Safari,
[01:25:50.820 --> 01:25:52.140]   for instance, it'll have a web page.
[01:25:52.140 --> 01:25:54.860]   And now instead of this nice, tidy little narrow column,
[01:25:54.860 --> 01:25:55.620]   it's easy to read.
[01:25:55.620 --> 01:25:59.100]   Now it fills the entire dimensions of your screen.
[01:25:59.100 --> 01:26:02.940]   In Safari, you'll notice that if you most of the very edge
[01:26:02.940 --> 01:26:06.820]   of the screen and click, you can actually drag to resize
[01:26:06.820 --> 01:26:09.540]   the size of the fake window that it's in.
[01:26:09.540 --> 01:26:12.020]   So now the margins of that full screen
[01:26:12.020 --> 01:26:13.860]   are now going to be a little bit narrower,
[01:26:13.860 --> 01:26:16.340]   so which might make things a little bit easier to manage.
[01:26:16.340 --> 01:26:18.860]   And as soon as I came across this, I thought, oh, wow,
[01:26:18.860 --> 01:26:21.660]   I bet that's such a useful thing that I bet that Apple put
[01:26:21.660 --> 01:26:23.100]   that into every single app.
[01:26:23.100 --> 01:26:24.060]   Oh, that doesn't work.
[01:26:24.060 --> 01:26:27.340]   And OK, well, I bet that they put that into all of their--
[01:26:27.340 --> 01:26:28.420]   all their iWork apps?
[01:26:28.420 --> 01:26:30.380]   No, it doesn't even work in pages.
[01:26:30.380 --> 01:26:33.220]   So I really wish that's something that would cross over.
[01:26:33.220 --> 01:26:35.700]   I use pages often in full screen mode,
[01:26:35.700 --> 01:26:39.060]   but there's just that little bit of OCD
[01:26:39.060 --> 01:26:44.220]   that says, if that paper were about one inch narrower,
[01:26:44.220 --> 01:26:47.500]   I would get the happiest boy in all of Puppetland.
[01:26:47.500 --> 01:26:51.340]   You just need to see that border, that little edge.
[01:26:51.340 --> 01:26:53.700]   It's just a little bit too wide.
[01:26:53.700 --> 01:26:55.900]   Can I just make a little narrower?
[01:26:55.900 --> 01:26:57.100]   Please, but you can't do it.
[01:26:57.100 --> 01:26:57.940]   Not yet.
[01:26:57.940 --> 01:27:01.540]   It works worse than Safari, but not a platform one.
[01:27:01.540 --> 01:27:03.060]   Hopefully we'll see you at Propagate.
[01:27:03.060 --> 01:27:06.340]   My tip of the week is mostly dealing with power saving.
[01:27:06.340 --> 01:27:08.500]   So one of the things that I spend a lot of time doing
[01:27:08.500 --> 01:27:12.060]   is-- and I think it's mostly knowing when your iOS--
[01:27:12.060 --> 01:27:14.580]   what is burning up your iOS power
[01:27:14.580 --> 01:27:17.260]   and how you can try to keep it lasting a little longer
[01:27:17.260 --> 01:27:20.460]   and how you don't get surprised by the fact
[01:27:20.460 --> 01:27:22.260]   that you had a lot of power and suddenly you don't.
[01:27:22.260 --> 01:27:25.620]   So one of the things that you can do--
[01:27:25.620 --> 01:27:28.180]   the first thing to do if you want your battery to last
[01:27:28.180 --> 01:27:30.860]   for a long time is to double click
[01:27:30.860 --> 01:27:34.900]   and make sure that Skype is not running on your iOS device.
[01:27:34.900 --> 01:27:37.500]   And the reason is, now I use Skype, actually,
[01:27:37.500 --> 01:27:40.620]   a fair bit on my iPhone and my iPad.
[01:27:40.620 --> 01:27:42.820]   But the problem is, is that for whatever it's doing
[01:27:42.820 --> 01:27:44.900]   to constantly check the network to make sure
[01:27:44.900 --> 01:27:47.860]   that someone can call you, burns through your battery
[01:27:47.860 --> 01:27:48.900]   very, very fast.
[01:27:48.900 --> 01:27:52.460]   And if you leave Skype running all day,
[01:27:52.460 --> 01:27:55.940]   I've noticed that my battery can run out two to three times
[01:27:55.940 --> 01:28:02.500]   faster than normally with just sitting there not being used.
[01:28:02.500 --> 01:28:06.300]   It really has a massive impact on your battery in your life.
[01:28:06.300 --> 01:28:07.700]   And so making sure to turn that off,
[01:28:07.700 --> 01:28:09.740]   anything has a lot of background processes.
[01:28:09.740 --> 01:28:13.420]   It's not a bad idea if you're going on a trip
[01:28:13.420 --> 01:28:15.860]   to restart your-- just so you don't have to think about it,
[01:28:15.860 --> 01:28:19.580]   just restart your iOS device if you want to make sure
[01:28:19.580 --> 01:28:20.980]   that it's going to last as long as it can.
[01:28:20.980 --> 01:28:22.900]   Because you can go through and by hand,
[01:28:22.900 --> 01:28:24.340]   turn off all the background processes.
[01:28:24.340 --> 01:28:26.940]   But some of them, especially ones that are chatting with the network,
[01:28:26.940 --> 01:28:31.980]   are going to be using that data up or using the battery up
[01:28:31.980 --> 01:28:33.420]   to get a hold of that network.
[01:28:33.420 --> 01:28:37.460]   Network is the big thing that I find that is affecting your iOS
[01:28:37.460 --> 01:28:38.100]   battery length.
[01:28:38.100 --> 01:28:41.060]   And so the other thing to do, it's not so much--
[01:28:41.060 --> 01:28:43.660]   talking to some engineers, it's not actually
[01:28:43.660 --> 01:28:47.300]   being connected to a 3G network or being connected to Wi-Fi
[01:28:47.300 --> 01:28:48.380]   that burns up the battery.
[01:28:48.380 --> 01:28:49.860]   It's looking for it.
[01:28:49.860 --> 01:28:53.100]   So if you don't have a solid Wi-Fi connection,
[01:28:53.100 --> 01:28:56.180]   or if you have one bar that's constantly coming on and off,
[01:28:56.180 --> 01:29:00.860]   also if you don't have a solid phone connection,
[01:29:00.860 --> 01:29:03.340]   that's the time when the phone goes into overdrive
[01:29:03.340 --> 01:29:04.860]   to sit there and find the network.
[01:29:04.860 --> 01:29:06.580]   So it's trying to find the Wi-Fi network.
[01:29:06.580 --> 01:29:08.740]   It's trying to find the 3G network.
[01:29:08.740 --> 01:29:11.380]   And so those are the things that you want to--
[01:29:11.380 --> 01:29:12.780]   if you're not getting a good connection
[01:29:12.780 --> 01:29:15.700]   and you want it to last a longer, one of the things to do
[01:29:15.700 --> 01:29:18.620]   is to turn off your Wi-Fi and possibly put it
[01:29:18.620 --> 01:29:21.860]   on airplane mode if you don't need to get a call.
[01:29:21.860 --> 01:29:22.980]   And you're trying to make it-- you know,
[01:29:22.980 --> 01:29:25.060]   if you've got 9% left and you don't have a charger
[01:29:25.060 --> 01:29:26.300]   and you're still driving and you still
[01:29:26.300 --> 01:29:29.660]   like to be able to turn it and you use it to some degree,
[01:29:29.660 --> 01:29:32.340]   but you want to make sure that it survives without completely
[01:29:32.340 --> 01:29:34.020]   turning off the phone.
[01:29:34.020 --> 01:29:36.300]   One of the things that you want to do is go ahead
[01:29:36.300 --> 01:29:37.840]   and make sure to turn off Wi-Fi.
[01:29:37.840 --> 01:29:40.260]   Well, if you're not using Wi-Fi, the problem
[01:29:40.260 --> 01:29:42.900]   is that if you leave it on and you're not really using it,
[01:29:42.900 --> 01:29:44.780]   it's constantly looking and it's constantly
[01:29:44.780 --> 01:29:47.980]   picking up Wi-Fi accounts.
[01:29:47.980 --> 01:29:49.140]   And that's using up your battery.
[01:29:49.140 --> 01:29:52.060]   And 3G, the number one reason to turn off your phone
[01:29:52.060 --> 01:29:55.740]   on a plane is not because it's going to do anything
[01:29:55.740 --> 01:29:56.940]   with the plane because it's not going to do anything
[01:29:56.940 --> 01:29:57.100]   with the plane.
[01:29:57.100 --> 01:29:58.540]   That's just silly.
[01:29:58.540 --> 01:30:01.260]   The main reason is that if you go on a five-hour flight
[01:30:01.260 --> 01:30:04.820]   when you land, you'll have 80% of your battery is gone
[01:30:04.820 --> 01:30:07.220]   because it's been sitting there in your pocket, by the way.
[01:30:07.220 --> 01:30:09.500]   If anyone who's paranoid about getting cancer,
[01:30:09.500 --> 01:30:11.300]   your phone has been sitting there in your pocket
[01:30:11.300 --> 01:30:14.380]   using the maximum amount of wireless bandwidth
[01:30:14.380 --> 01:30:17.900]   that it can, trying to find something for five hours.
[01:30:17.900 --> 01:30:21.300]   And so if you have any paranoia about cancer and a phone,
[01:30:21.300 --> 01:30:23.940]   you should worry about that.
[01:30:23.940 --> 01:30:27.300]   And that's directly from a cell phone engineer.
[01:30:27.300 --> 01:30:29.020]   I said that's the number one reason to turn it off,
[01:30:29.020 --> 01:30:30.820]   was that it burns up your battery and it
[01:30:30.820 --> 01:30:36.220]   emits this three-foot sphere of mass of energy
[01:30:36.220 --> 01:30:40.580]   while it's looking anytime it doesn't have a connection.
[01:30:40.580 --> 01:30:43.300]   When I go to New York, the first thing I do when I hit Penn
[01:30:43.300 --> 01:30:47.100]   Station is to switch from 3G to edge for almost exactly
[01:30:47.100 --> 01:30:51.260]   that reason because I never get good 3G coverage in New York.
[01:30:51.260 --> 01:30:53.260]   I've always been very, very amused by the fact
[01:30:53.260 --> 01:30:57.540]   that on an Amtrak train going from 50 to 110 miles an hour
[01:30:57.540 --> 01:31:01.940]   from Boston to New York, I get good, strong, reliable digital
[01:31:01.940 --> 01:31:03.020]   data in 3G.
[01:31:03.020 --> 01:31:05.340]   As soon as I go to the big one of the biggest cities,
[01:31:05.340 --> 01:31:07.580]   most important cities in the world,
[01:31:07.580 --> 01:31:10.100]   and welcome to my world.
[01:31:10.100 --> 01:31:13.860]   And if I live in on 3G, I can't let the battery on my phone
[01:31:13.860 --> 01:31:15.260]   won't last a single day.
[01:31:15.260 --> 01:31:18.340]   If I put it onto edge, I'll still get access to text messages
[01:31:18.340 --> 01:31:21.660]   and the phone calls, but it will last as long as it would
[01:31:21.660 --> 01:31:22.900]   back in Boston.
[01:31:22.900 --> 01:31:24.980]   So anyway, so those are my little tip.
[01:31:24.980 --> 01:31:27.860]   My iOS tips is just how to keep things lasting just
[01:31:27.860 --> 01:31:28.860]   a little bit longer.
[01:31:28.860 --> 01:31:31.020]   So now we're going to go to our tips of the week.
[01:31:31.020 --> 01:31:32.820]   Clayton, we'll let you kick it off.
[01:31:32.820 --> 01:31:34.340]   Tips of the week are we still doing line tips?
[01:31:34.340 --> 01:31:35.780]   I'm sorry, picks of the week.
[01:31:35.780 --> 01:31:36.660]   Picks of the week.
[01:31:36.660 --> 01:31:38.540]   Picks of the week.
[01:31:38.540 --> 01:31:40.780]   So I don't know how many people in the Mac
[01:31:40.780 --> 01:31:43.620]   Brick Weekly audience use Stitcher,
[01:31:43.620 --> 01:31:44.980]   but I have now--
[01:31:44.980 --> 01:31:46.340]   Are you talking about Autodesk Stitcher?
[01:31:46.340 --> 01:31:47.740]   Or are you talking about--
[01:31:47.740 --> 01:31:49.380]   No, I'm talking Stitcher Radio.
[01:31:49.380 --> 01:31:50.180]   OK.
[01:31:50.180 --> 01:31:54.860]   So Stitcher Radio for iOS, it also works on Android as well.
[01:31:54.860 --> 01:31:56.980]   They have a beautiful iPad app.
[01:31:56.980 --> 01:32:00.020]   So for those of you guys who aren't familiar with Stitcher,
[01:32:00.020 --> 01:32:03.340]   here is the iPad app.
[01:32:03.340 --> 01:32:08.620]   And what it does is you can add your favorite podcasts,
[01:32:08.620 --> 01:32:11.380]   any of your favorite shows, in your favorites list.
[01:32:11.380 --> 01:32:12.260]   And it streams.
[01:32:12.260 --> 01:32:14.740]   So you're streaming all of your favorite podcasts
[01:32:14.740 --> 01:32:16.060]   and all your favorite shows.
[01:32:16.060 --> 01:32:18.620]   So Mac Brick Weekly, anything you want to do.
[01:32:18.620 --> 01:32:21.620]   And most all of your favorite podcasts
[01:32:21.620 --> 01:32:23.220]   are likely to be in Stitcher.
[01:32:23.220 --> 01:32:25.460]   Some of them, if they haven't really notified Stitcher
[01:32:25.460 --> 01:32:27.660]   to get them published there, it's free.
[01:32:27.660 --> 01:32:28.940]   The app is free.
[01:32:28.940 --> 01:32:31.060]   They have on-demand stations as well.
[01:32:31.060 --> 01:32:33.100]   And this is Stitcher Radio.
[01:32:33.100 --> 01:32:34.180]   Yeah, this is Stitcher Radio.
[01:32:34.180 --> 01:32:35.700]   So it works great on the iPhone.
[01:32:35.700 --> 01:32:37.580]   For a long time, I used it on the iPhone.
[01:32:37.580 --> 01:32:39.300]   So instead of downloading podcasts,
[01:32:39.300 --> 01:32:42.220]   if I was on vacation, if I was away from my main machine
[01:32:42.220 --> 01:32:44.340]   where I wanted to download, or I didn't have a Wi-Fi connection
[01:32:44.340 --> 01:32:46.300]   setup, and I just didn't have the ability
[01:32:46.300 --> 01:32:49.660]   to download 40 megabyte show or something like that,
[01:32:49.660 --> 01:32:52.380]   Stitcher is great, because as soon as the show is available
[01:32:52.380 --> 01:32:53.940]   on iTunes, or as soon as it's available,
[01:32:53.940 --> 01:32:57.100]   wherever fine podcasts are sold, it's available in Stitcher.
[01:32:57.100 --> 01:32:58.620]   And the audio quality is fantastic.
[01:32:58.620 --> 01:32:59.580]   Stream's right over that.
[01:32:59.580 --> 01:33:02.180]   And the iOS app is great.
[01:33:02.180 --> 01:33:04.340]   And I use that all the time walking around.
[01:33:04.340 --> 01:33:07.500]   But every time you log in, you have the ability
[01:33:07.500 --> 01:33:09.860]   to refresh your shows at the bottom of the screen.
[01:33:09.860 --> 01:33:11.820]   So you hit the little refresh bar at the bottom.
[01:33:11.820 --> 01:33:12.940]   All of your shows are updated.
[01:33:12.940 --> 01:33:15.300]   And you can have access to the previous episodes.
[01:33:15.300 --> 01:33:16.900]   That was a recent update.
[01:33:16.900 --> 01:33:19.940]   So I have all of my shows in there for streaming as well,
[01:33:19.940 --> 01:33:21.940]   all the shows that we produce.
[01:33:21.940 --> 01:33:23.140]   And it's fantastic.
[01:33:23.140 --> 01:33:25.660]   Yesterday, we were driving the car up here to the mountains.
[01:33:25.660 --> 01:33:28.940]   And we just wanted to listen to some finance news.
[01:33:28.940 --> 01:33:31.100]   We wanted to hear some of the latest stuff out of Wall Street
[01:33:31.100 --> 01:33:32.420]   with what was going on.
[01:33:32.420 --> 01:33:35.980]   And we listened to like six or seven in a row.
[01:33:35.980 --> 01:33:37.020]   We just hit play.
[01:33:37.020 --> 01:33:40.460]   We're able to listen to some Wall Street Journal contents.
[01:33:40.460 --> 01:33:41.620]   And this is not downloaded.
[01:33:41.620 --> 01:33:43.900]   It's actually streaming it.
[01:33:43.900 --> 01:33:45.020]   Right, and it's caching too.
[01:33:45.020 --> 01:33:48.060]   So I have done this where I've been running to get on a plane.
[01:33:48.060 --> 01:33:50.300]   And maybe I've been listening to Mac per weekly,
[01:33:50.300 --> 01:33:53.540]   or I've been listening to the Wall Street Journal this morning,
[01:33:53.540 --> 01:33:54.540]   or something like that.
[01:33:54.540 --> 01:33:57.580]   And it's cached that the plane takes off.
[01:33:57.580 --> 01:33:59.700]   And I've admitted that maybe I'm one of those people
[01:33:59.700 --> 01:34:02.380]   that didn't put my phone in airplane mode immediately.
[01:34:02.380 --> 01:34:05.860]   And I'm listening to the duration of the podcast,
[01:34:05.860 --> 01:34:09.540]   which has cached well enough for an hour and a half of the flight.
[01:34:09.540 --> 01:34:11.020]   And then once the show was over, I'm
[01:34:11.020 --> 01:34:12.580]   not able to get new content.
[01:34:12.580 --> 01:34:13.780]   But I really love Stitcher.
[01:34:13.780 --> 01:34:15.780]   I mean, I think that these guys do a great job.
[01:34:15.780 --> 01:34:19.020]   And plus, there's all sorts of social integration.
[01:34:19.020 --> 01:34:21.180]   And what's great is it works between iOS apps.
[01:34:21.180 --> 01:34:25.700]   So if I'm listening on my iPhone and I stop an episode
[01:34:25.700 --> 01:34:28.740]   and I pick up my iPad, it'll pick up right where I left off
[01:34:28.740 --> 01:34:29.380]   on my iPhone.
[01:34:29.380 --> 01:34:30.660]   It'll say, we're zooming episode.
[01:34:30.660 --> 01:34:31.860]   And boom, it's right there.
[01:34:31.860 --> 01:34:35.140]   So I really have to admit, I've switched off of downloading
[01:34:35.140 --> 01:34:36.220]   quite a few podcasts.
[01:34:36.220 --> 01:34:37.860]   It's now just streaming.
[01:34:37.860 --> 01:34:40.380]   And I think that this is where hopefully Apple will
[01:34:40.380 --> 01:34:42.660]   be able to do some similar things with iCloud.
[01:34:42.660 --> 01:34:45.340]   But for right now, I think Stitcher has been well out
[01:34:45.340 --> 01:34:48.020]   in front of this and has been doing a really great job.
[01:34:48.020 --> 01:34:49.380]   And it's free, isn't it?
[01:34:49.380 --> 01:34:49.940]   It's free.
[01:34:49.940 --> 01:34:51.380]   It's free, and it's fantastic.
[01:34:51.380 --> 01:34:51.820]   I love it.
[01:34:51.820 --> 01:34:54.260]   And again, it works on multiple devices.
[01:34:54.260 --> 01:34:56.180]   So it's not just iOS, it's Android.
[01:34:56.180 --> 01:34:57.700]   And I think it's also BlackBerry.
[01:34:57.700 --> 01:34:59.820]   I think it's also BlackBerry, too.
[01:34:59.820 --> 01:35:01.500]   And presumably, it works between apps.
[01:35:01.500 --> 01:35:02.420]   So it knows your account.
[01:35:02.420 --> 01:35:04.020]   It knows what your favorites are.
[01:35:04.020 --> 01:35:05.860]   And when you're refreshing, it knows
[01:35:05.860 --> 01:35:07.460]   that you have favorites on one.
[01:35:07.460 --> 01:35:10.820]   It works better than MobileMeSync.
[01:35:10.820 --> 01:35:13.940]   Which isn't saying very much, but it's better.
[01:35:13.940 --> 01:35:17.540]   So Andy, what's your pick for the week?
[01:35:17.540 --> 01:35:20.620]   My pick for the week is another iOS app.
[01:35:20.620 --> 01:35:25.020]   It's an app from Riald called PDF Converter.
[01:35:25.020 --> 01:35:27.500]   And this shows the goodness and the badness
[01:35:27.500 --> 01:35:28.020]   of the app store.
[01:35:28.020 --> 01:35:29.860]   There are about a half dozen apps that
[01:35:29.860 --> 01:35:33.780]   will in some way convert something you have on your iPad
[01:35:33.780 --> 01:35:35.340]   into a PDF.
[01:35:35.340 --> 01:35:37.940]   But PDF Converter by Riald is the one you want.
[01:35:37.940 --> 01:35:40.780]   It's something like $5.99, $6.99, but a buck or two,
[01:35:40.780 --> 01:35:42.500]   more expensive than the others.
[01:35:42.500 --> 01:35:45.420]   But it works exceptionally well.
[01:35:45.420 --> 01:35:49.460]   I'll show you one thing that I use it for all the time.
[01:35:49.460 --> 01:35:51.660]   There are a whole bunch of really cool services,
[01:35:51.660 --> 01:35:55.700]   like Instapaper, that will convert web pages
[01:35:55.700 --> 01:36:00.700]   into eBooks that you can then re-sync and then re-download.
[01:36:00.700 --> 01:36:03.860]   The great thing about PDF Converters
[01:36:03.860 --> 01:36:06.620]   is that it can convert pretty much any web page
[01:36:06.620 --> 01:36:10.460]   that you've got that you're watching right here on your iPad
[01:36:10.460 --> 01:36:13.780]   and convert it into PDF without having to leave,
[01:36:13.780 --> 01:36:16.380]   without having to do anything else entirely.
[01:36:16.380 --> 01:36:18.460]   So if you've got a web page you've got,
[01:36:18.460 --> 01:36:22.540]   there's a really cool GQ article interview with Jerry Lewis,
[01:36:22.540 --> 01:36:24.580]   as you might have guessed.
[01:36:24.580 --> 01:36:25.900]   Really cool mechanism.
[01:36:25.900 --> 01:36:28.460]   All you have to do is go to Safari,
[01:36:28.460 --> 01:36:31.580]   write in Safari, you just move the cursor
[01:36:31.580 --> 01:36:36.580]   to the very, very front of the URL, add a PDF to it, PDF.
[01:36:36.580 --> 01:36:39.700]   The exact same URL, now it's PDF, HTTP,
[01:36:39.700 --> 01:36:41.740]   colon, backslash, backslash.
[01:36:41.740 --> 01:36:43.980]   Go to that URL in Safari.
[01:36:43.980 --> 01:36:48.980]   It will send that page into PDF Converter.
[01:36:48.980 --> 01:36:50.700]   I type the convert button.
[01:36:50.700 --> 01:36:54.340]   And after a little bit of crunching,
[01:36:54.340 --> 01:36:58.220]   and this, that all happens on your iPad itself,
[01:36:58.220 --> 01:37:00.380]   it doesn't send anything else where, so it's a cure.
[01:37:00.380 --> 01:37:03.740]   I now have a PDF of that exact same web page
[01:37:03.740 --> 01:37:06.140]   that now lives right here on my iPad.
[01:37:06.140 --> 01:37:07.900]   - Can you add that to your iBooks or?
[01:37:07.900 --> 01:37:08.940]   - Exactly.
[01:37:08.940 --> 01:37:12.260]   You can then, it completely works with any of the,
[01:37:12.260 --> 01:37:15.420]   any of the iOS is basic sharing services.
[01:37:15.420 --> 01:37:17.980]   So if I tap a button here,
[01:37:17.980 --> 01:37:20.220]   there's a standard sharing button right here at the top.
[01:37:20.220 --> 01:37:22.300]   So I just type open in,
[01:37:22.300 --> 01:37:25.700]   and now I can send this to any app that I've got on my iPad
[01:37:25.700 --> 01:37:27.580]   that can accept a PDF.
[01:37:27.580 --> 01:37:29.620]   So if I just type, tap iBooks,
[01:37:29.620 --> 01:37:31.580]   now that will be sent directly into iBooks
[01:37:31.580 --> 01:37:33.940]   and as a new permanent book.
[01:37:33.940 --> 01:37:36.100]   And it works both ways too,
[01:37:36.100 --> 01:37:38.740]   so that if you've got like an email attachment,
[01:37:38.740 --> 01:37:42.500]   it'll, it can basically open any office file,
[01:37:42.500 --> 01:37:46.060]   any iWork file, email, emails with attachments,
[01:37:46.060 --> 01:37:48.660]   convert those things into PDFs.
[01:37:48.660 --> 01:37:52.620]   It can take documents you've got inside Dropbox or iDISC
[01:37:52.620 --> 01:37:54.740]   and convert those to PDF.
[01:37:54.740 --> 01:37:58.740]   It also has, the company also has another app
[01:37:58.740 --> 01:38:00.700]   called PDF Pro, I think it's called.
[01:38:00.700 --> 01:38:02.060]   - And is this, and this is,
[01:38:02.060 --> 01:38:04.500]   is the company ready?
[01:38:04.500 --> 01:38:06.220]   Is that right?
[01:38:06.220 --> 01:38:09.220]   The problem is, is there's two PDF converters.
[01:38:09.220 --> 01:38:11.260]   - Yeah, it's most really silly at generic.
[01:38:11.260 --> 01:38:13.620]   It's READDE.com.
[01:38:13.620 --> 01:38:14.460]   - Reattle, I think.
[01:38:14.460 --> 01:38:15.300]   - Reattle it.
[01:38:15.300 --> 01:38:16.140]   - Okay, got it.
[01:38:16.140 --> 01:38:18.340]   'Cause there's another PDF converter for the iPad
[01:38:18.340 --> 01:38:20.780]   is something else, it's RED or whatever.
[01:38:20.780 --> 01:38:22.380]   And so, but so.
[01:38:22.380 --> 01:38:23.220]   - That's the one we want.
[01:38:23.220 --> 01:38:24.780]   That's the one we got right there.
[01:38:24.780 --> 01:38:25.620]   - Okay.
[01:38:25.620 --> 01:38:27.180]   - And the other cool thing is that they have a companion app
[01:38:27.180 --> 01:38:28.820]   called PDFExpert.
[01:38:28.820 --> 01:38:31.620]   A PDF converter will do the conversion.
[01:38:31.620 --> 01:38:34.700]   It'll also store PDFs locally,
[01:38:34.700 --> 01:38:35.980]   password protected if you'd like.
[01:38:35.980 --> 01:38:38.740]   So it's an okay, it's a good file cabinet app
[01:38:38.740 --> 01:38:41.300]   for keeping documents on your iPad.
[01:38:41.300 --> 01:38:42.780]   But it also has a companion app,
[01:38:42.780 --> 01:38:45.700]   which will let you annotate, sign stuff,
[01:38:45.700 --> 01:38:47.140]   do a little edits to PDFs
[01:38:47.140 --> 01:38:48.780]   and then resend them elsewhere.
[01:38:48.780 --> 01:38:52.060]   So that's a $9.99 extra.
[01:38:52.060 --> 01:38:53.220]   Not everybody uses that.
[01:38:53.220 --> 01:38:56.380]   But in the, in terms to solve the basic problem of,
[01:38:56.380 --> 01:38:58.740]   I've got this thing that I've seen on the web.
[01:38:58.740 --> 01:39:01.540]   I want to capture it and keep it forever and ever
[01:39:01.540 --> 01:39:02.860]   so that I never lose it.
[01:39:02.860 --> 01:39:04.380]   And I don't want to ever have to count
[01:39:04.380 --> 01:39:06.620]   on having a 3G connection to somebody else
[01:39:06.620 --> 01:39:07.980]   in order to re-sync it.
[01:39:07.980 --> 01:39:10.060]   This is a really, really great solution.
[01:39:10.060 --> 01:39:12.620]   And the other cool thing is that you can also email
[01:39:12.620 --> 01:39:15.020]   right from the app so that if you've got,
[01:39:15.020 --> 01:39:17.100]   so it's very, very easy to then capture something
[01:39:17.100 --> 01:39:18.820]   and then resend it to somebody else
[01:39:18.820 --> 01:39:22.300]   or email it into, into paper or email it into
[01:39:22.300 --> 01:39:23.380]   when you're cloud services,
[01:39:23.380 --> 01:39:25.260]   you've got an inbox that works that way.
[01:39:25.260 --> 01:39:27.460]   So not expensive at all.
[01:39:27.460 --> 01:39:31.900]   Really clean app looks pretty, very, very useful.
[01:39:31.900 --> 01:39:36.660]   I didn't even bother trying to scam a free code for it.
[01:39:36.660 --> 01:39:38.460]   As I remember the press was like,
[01:39:38.460 --> 01:39:40.300]   okay, this is useful, this is good.
[01:39:40.300 --> 01:39:41.900]   You've got my 5.99.
[01:39:41.900 --> 01:39:44.460]   - Well, you know, I thought I was running web 7138
[01:39:44.460 --> 01:39:45.300]   in the chat room and said,
[01:39:45.300 --> 01:39:46.940]   I find it really tough to spend more than five bucks
[01:39:46.940 --> 01:39:47.940]   on an app and I was like, you know,
[01:39:47.940 --> 01:39:49.540]   we've really come a long way when we're sending like,
[01:39:49.540 --> 01:39:54.540]   oh, they went over $5 really, I mean, you know.
[01:39:54.540 --> 01:39:57.020]   - You gotta do the Homer Simpson,
[01:39:57.020 --> 01:39:58.820]   oh, $5, eh?
[01:39:58.820 --> 01:40:03.260]   It only transports matter, not energy.
[01:40:03.260 --> 01:40:05.100]   - Oh, I don't know.
[01:40:05.100 --> 01:40:06.820]   - Oh, Marge.
[01:40:06.820 --> 01:40:09.220]   So PDF converter and it is by--
[01:40:09.220 --> 01:40:11.220]   - Thank God World War II didn't have to be fought
[01:40:11.220 --> 01:40:12.540]   by people like us.
[01:40:12.540 --> 01:40:14.660]   - Exactly, exactly.
[01:40:14.660 --> 01:40:15.740]   I don't know if it would have,
[01:40:15.740 --> 01:40:17.580]   like, oh, it's getting, it's kind of rainy out there
[01:40:17.580 --> 01:40:19.260]   and the water looks a little rough.
[01:40:19.260 --> 01:40:21.580]   I don't know if those beaches looked so good today.
[01:40:21.580 --> 01:40:22.540]   It's all that barbed wire.
[01:40:22.540 --> 01:40:23.980]   I don't think I'm gonna get a good tan.
[01:40:23.980 --> 01:40:28.980]   So anyway, so my pick of the week is Omni Graph Sketcher.
[01:40:28.980 --> 01:40:31.580]   Andy, have you used this at all?
[01:40:31.580 --> 01:40:32.420]   - Yes.
[01:40:32.420 --> 01:40:34.620]   - This is a little bit of a vertical and I don't know
[01:40:34.620 --> 01:40:36.700]   have you seen this Clayton?
[01:40:36.700 --> 01:40:39.140]   - Yeah, I have, it's incredible.
[01:40:39.140 --> 01:40:41.780]   These guys, and this is the Omni group
[01:40:41.780 --> 01:40:42.900]   that does incredible stuff.
[01:40:42.900 --> 01:40:44.700]   - Yeah, I mean, I think I have all the wraps
[01:40:44.700 --> 01:40:48.580]   and I, but Omni Graph Sketcher is,
[01:40:48.580 --> 01:40:50.660]   it's a little bit, it's for people who,
[01:40:50.660 --> 01:40:52.380]   if you need to show graphs and so on and so forth,
[01:40:52.380 --> 01:40:53.380]   there's a couple of things that it does.
[01:40:53.380 --> 01:40:55.340]   It allows you to clean up data.
[01:40:55.340 --> 01:40:58.660]   So sometimes you're not gonna use the built-in graph.
[01:40:58.660 --> 01:40:59.860]   Well, actually, some of it's like,
[01:40:59.860 --> 01:41:01.180]   I've been doing a lot of stuff in keynote
[01:41:01.180 --> 01:41:03.260]   where I have to show a whole bunch of graphs right now.
[01:41:03.260 --> 01:41:05.420]   If you put in a lot of data in the keynote,
[01:41:05.420 --> 01:41:06.260]   just in case you're wondering,
[01:41:06.260 --> 01:41:09.700]   keynote doesn't crash, but you think it did,
[01:41:09.700 --> 01:41:13.140]   because it just goes, you know, it just totally locks up.
[01:41:13.140 --> 01:41:15.700]   And it can't handle a lot of that data.
[01:41:15.700 --> 01:41:17.460]   And so you need somewhere where I can get a graph.
[01:41:17.460 --> 01:41:19.900]   I need an image that I'm gonna take somewhere else,
[01:41:19.900 --> 01:41:22.020]   I'm gonna do whatever I'm gonna do to it,
[01:41:22.020 --> 01:41:24.220]   but I need it to be nice and clean and I wanna adjust it
[01:41:24.220 --> 01:41:25.140]   and I wanna make it look pretty
[01:41:25.140 --> 01:41:26.620]   and I wanna make, do those kind of things
[01:41:26.620 --> 01:41:28.420]   that I'm gonna put that graph somewhere else
[01:41:28.420 --> 01:41:31.180]   and I don't wanna do it live because it's too much data.
[01:41:31.180 --> 01:41:33.260]   And I might wanna adjust that data and move it around.
[01:41:33.260 --> 01:41:35.500]   And so that's one of the things that,
[01:41:35.500 --> 01:41:37.100]   that's what I'm using this for.
[01:41:37.100 --> 01:41:40.980]   And it's, you can take data and plot it,
[01:41:40.980 --> 01:41:42.300]   but you can also, a lot of times,
[01:41:42.300 --> 01:41:46.100]   you just wanna say, and the equation's going to get better.
[01:41:46.100 --> 01:41:47.660]   You know, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:41:47.660 --> 01:41:49.540]   It's just going to, you know,
[01:41:49.540 --> 01:41:50.820]   and then we're gonna sell more
[01:41:50.820 --> 01:41:52.060]   and you just wanna draw a line.
[01:41:52.060 --> 01:41:54.820]   But before, before Omni Graphs catcher,
[01:41:54.820 --> 01:41:55.660]   you have to think about like,
[01:41:55.660 --> 01:41:58.140]   what do I input into numbers or into something
[01:41:58.140 --> 01:42:00.900]   so I can get a graph to show what I wanted to show?
[01:42:00.900 --> 01:42:02.260]   I just wanna say that it's gonna go up.
[01:42:02.260 --> 01:42:04.540]   I don't need to say it's gonna go up exactly this much.
[01:42:04.540 --> 01:42:05.940]   But now I'm typing in stuff
[01:42:05.940 --> 01:42:08.140]   so I can get a graph that looks that way.
[01:42:08.140 --> 01:42:11.380]   With Omni Graphs catcher, you can actually just draw it.
[01:42:11.380 --> 01:42:12.660]   Now, you know, just draw the graph
[01:42:12.660 --> 01:42:15.020]   and it actually puts in value points
[01:42:15.020 --> 01:42:17.740]   that's going to give you that result.
[01:42:17.740 --> 01:42:18.940]   And so you have that result.
[01:42:18.940 --> 01:42:20.540]   In fact, one of the things that I've used it for
[01:42:20.540 --> 01:42:21.620]   is actually drawing that line
[01:42:21.620 --> 01:42:23.140]   and then cutting and pasting that,
[01:42:23.140 --> 01:42:25.820]   those value points into a document
[01:42:25.820 --> 01:42:27.020]   that I can then have as a graph
[01:42:27.020 --> 01:42:28.820]   that can animate and all the other stuff in Keynote.
[01:42:28.820 --> 01:42:30.100]   And so the ability to do that,
[01:42:30.100 --> 01:42:31.500]   you can also color in regions,
[01:42:31.500 --> 01:42:32.660]   you can make them, you know,
[01:42:32.660 --> 01:42:33.900]   you can do all the pretty things
[01:42:33.900 --> 01:42:35.660]   that you wanna do with graphs
[01:42:35.660 --> 01:42:37.780]   without using necessarily something like Illustrator
[01:42:37.780 --> 01:42:39.300]   or something that's much more expensive
[01:42:39.300 --> 01:42:40.540]   or much more complicated.
[01:42:40.540 --> 01:42:42.580]   This is a super simple way to do it.
[01:42:42.580 --> 01:42:45.380]   There are a couple of things that I'd love to see them add.
[01:42:45.380 --> 01:42:47.500]   You know, I'd love to see them make it easier for me
[01:42:47.500 --> 01:42:49.620]   to, what it really needs to do is sample
[01:42:49.620 --> 01:42:51.500]   along the x-axis a little bit better.
[01:42:51.500 --> 01:42:52.700]   So like when you're drawing,
[01:42:52.700 --> 01:42:54.420]   I want it to sample every time there's a tick mark.
[01:42:54.420 --> 01:42:56.140]   I want it to just grab whatever that position
[01:42:56.140 --> 01:42:59.020]   of that piece isn't in add a control point
[01:42:59.020 --> 01:43:01.140]   because that's typically how a lot of, you know,
[01:43:01.140 --> 01:43:03.140]   rise, run calculations work.
[01:43:03.140 --> 01:43:05.540]   So I kind of like to see that.
[01:43:05.540 --> 01:43:07.500]   I'd like to be able to control how often
[01:43:07.500 --> 01:43:09.300]   it's sampling those points.
[01:43:09.300 --> 01:43:13.740]   So there are things that I'd like to see
[01:43:13.740 --> 01:43:16.500]   in the next version, but I will say there's nothing,
[01:43:16.500 --> 01:43:19.380]   there's no other app like this that I have,
[01:43:19.380 --> 01:43:22.660]   that I've run across that allows you to grab a lot of data
[01:43:22.660 --> 01:43:24.020]   and visualize it.
[01:43:24.020 --> 01:43:29.020]   I need to do a graph and I had to find the Dow Jones data
[01:43:29.020 --> 01:43:33.620]   from the 20s and 30s, which were very rocky, as you know,
[01:43:33.620 --> 01:43:35.140]   almost as rocky as today.
[01:43:35.140 --> 01:43:38.940]   And I needed to get that graph
[01:43:38.940 --> 01:43:40.500]   and I needed to put it into a graph format.
[01:43:40.500 --> 01:43:42.340]   And I simply, I go up to the web, I get download
[01:43:42.340 --> 01:43:45.820]   and Excel file with all the Dow Jones since it's beginning,
[01:43:45.820 --> 01:43:47.820]   grab the section that I needed and just paste it in,
[01:43:47.820 --> 01:43:48.820]   bam, I got a graph.
[01:43:48.820 --> 01:43:51.260]   And I don't have to think about how that's gonna get converted.
[01:43:51.260 --> 01:43:52.660]   I don't have to think about any of those pieces
[01:43:52.660 --> 01:43:54.540]   and it was really, really easy.
[01:43:54.540 --> 01:43:57.100]   And so anyway, OmniGraph Sketcher,
[01:43:57.100 --> 01:43:58.940]   it is, I believe $30 for the Mac.
[01:43:58.940 --> 01:44:01.180]   I think there's another version that's also available
[01:44:01.180 --> 01:44:03.180]   on the iPad.
[01:44:03.180 --> 01:44:05.380]   And it's a great, if you're doing that kind of thing,
[01:44:05.380 --> 01:44:06.660]   it's a great little application.
[01:44:06.660 --> 01:44:08.920]   And as I said, I don't know of anyone else that's doing it
[01:44:08.920 --> 01:44:10.540]   and of course, because the OmniGraph's doing it,
[01:44:10.540 --> 01:44:11.680]   it's going to be a lot.
[01:44:11.680 --> 01:44:13.680]   It's going to be clean, stable,
[01:44:13.680 --> 01:44:16.300]   and do exactly what it says it's gonna do.
[01:44:16.300 --> 01:44:18.840]   So anyway, OmniGraph Sketcher, and I think it's like,
[01:44:18.840 --> 01:44:23.340]   as I can get a 14-day trial at the OmniGraph's website.
[01:44:23.340 --> 01:44:26.540]   So that concludes our excitement for the day.
[01:44:26.540 --> 01:44:28.920]   Clayton, where can people find you?
[01:44:28.920 --> 01:44:30.860]   - Well, they can always find me on Fox and Friends
[01:44:30.860 --> 01:44:32.320]   on the Fox News channel.
[01:44:32.320 --> 01:44:34.300]   And I do the weekend show.
[01:44:34.300 --> 01:44:36.500]   So give us a chance sometime.
[01:44:36.500 --> 01:44:38.240]   If you haven't had a chance to watch us,
[01:44:38.240 --> 01:44:39.860]   we have a lot of fun on that show.
[01:44:39.860 --> 01:44:42.540]   And also, you can check out.
[01:44:42.540 --> 01:44:46.820]   We're just about to, Alex and I talked a few weeks ago
[01:44:46.820 --> 01:44:47.660]   when you were in New York.
[01:44:47.660 --> 01:44:50.820]   I'm going through the pains of building our new website.
[01:44:50.820 --> 01:44:53.740]   So we've got a portion of the redirect up right now
[01:44:53.740 --> 01:44:56.420]   at grizzlyproductions.tv.
[01:44:56.420 --> 01:44:58.540]   And so we're building the main hub
[01:44:58.540 --> 01:45:00.100]   where all of our shows will live.
[01:45:00.100 --> 01:45:00.940]   Right now, we're sort of--
[01:45:00.940 --> 01:45:03.180]   - Is it still pretty much what I, you know--
[01:45:03.180 --> 01:45:04.020]   - Right.
[01:45:04.020 --> 01:45:06.580]   - Well, yeah, what you saw were the plans.
[01:45:06.580 --> 01:45:08.800]   But right now, we're just sort of laying
[01:45:08.800 --> 01:45:11.040]   some of the graphic implementation
[01:45:11.040 --> 01:45:12.080]   and sort of coming together.
[01:45:12.080 --> 01:45:14.680]   So the show is living disparate places right now.
[01:45:14.680 --> 01:45:17.280]   But, you know, I would say all of the shows
[01:45:17.280 --> 01:45:19.840]   that we do, Daddy on board, the Grizzly Bear Egg Cafe
[01:45:19.840 --> 01:45:21.440]   and our mommy show, mommy beta,
[01:45:21.440 --> 01:45:23.920]   they're all gonna be on Wonder One Roof.
[01:45:23.920 --> 01:45:27.800]   We may be very soon launching an autism show
[01:45:27.800 --> 01:45:30.440]   and also a sports show is coming to the network
[01:45:30.440 --> 01:45:31.400]   very soon, which will be great.
[01:45:31.400 --> 01:45:33.680]   Not hosted by me, but it'll be there.
[01:45:33.680 --> 01:45:36.660]   But one thing I wanna say for iOS fans,
[01:45:36.660 --> 01:45:38.300]   on our Daddy on board show,
[01:45:38.300 --> 01:45:39.580]   I would love you guys to check it out.
[01:45:39.580 --> 01:45:41.420]   If you just go to, you can search for some blip
[01:45:41.420 --> 01:45:44.060]   or on iTunes, it's a video show.
[01:45:44.060 --> 01:45:47.860]   We review a lot of kids apps every week on the show
[01:45:47.860 --> 01:45:50.300]   and we have a lot of people send us their favorites
[01:45:50.300 --> 01:45:52.460]   and there's so many to pick from.
[01:45:52.460 --> 01:45:54.540]   And we just have a great audience
[01:45:54.540 --> 01:45:56.300]   that has been testing them with their,
[01:45:56.300 --> 01:45:58.300]   and trust me, they're kid tested.
[01:45:58.300 --> 01:46:00.300]   So when the kids are testing them
[01:46:00.300 --> 01:46:02.580]   and then the parents approve and they tell us about it,
[01:46:02.580 --> 01:46:04.640]   we share them and we show them on our show every week.
[01:46:04.640 --> 01:46:06.680]   We have an app section of our show
[01:46:06.680 --> 01:46:09.780]   where we just specifically do kids apps.
[01:46:09.780 --> 01:46:12.120]   And so we have some great ones coming up this week
[01:46:12.120 --> 01:46:13.880]   as my wife writes for Consumer Reports.
[01:46:13.880 --> 01:46:17.420]   So she's reviewed this really incredible app
[01:46:17.420 --> 01:46:18.960]   for the kids that you put your,
[01:46:18.960 --> 01:46:21.300]   the kids foot on an iPad.
[01:46:21.300 --> 01:46:24.140]   And it measures the kids foot based on, you know,
[01:46:24.140 --> 01:46:24.960]   how fast they're growing.
[01:46:24.960 --> 01:46:27.600]   And you can, you know, you put the little footprint
[01:46:27.600 --> 01:46:29.340]   in cement before.
[01:46:29.340 --> 01:46:30.600]   Now you use an iPad to do it.
[01:46:30.600 --> 01:46:33.440]   So we have a lot of fun on Daddy on board
[01:46:33.440 --> 01:46:34.880]   and we have a lot of apps there.
[01:46:34.880 --> 01:46:36.440]   So you can check that out every week.
[01:46:36.440 --> 01:46:37.280]   Daddy on board.
[01:46:37.280 --> 01:46:41.080]   And it's something that I should be listening to more often.
[01:46:41.080 --> 01:46:42.240]   I listened to it in a couple of them,
[01:46:42.240 --> 01:46:45.640]   but I'm in the trenches there with you.
[01:46:45.640 --> 01:46:48.340]   So maybe one day your daughter will text message you
[01:46:48.340 --> 01:46:50.680]   about how you can be a better parent by watching this.
[01:46:50.680 --> 01:46:51.520]   (laughing)
[01:46:51.520 --> 01:46:53.020]   Oh my three year old, you're the rest of the--
[01:46:53.020 --> 01:46:54.920]   - 'Cause she could status up the UN Facebook
[01:46:54.920 --> 01:46:55.760]   and let you know.
[01:46:55.760 --> 01:46:57.160]   - You know, being the country boy that I am,
[01:46:57.160 --> 01:46:59.240]   my son didn't want to go to school this morning
[01:46:59.240 --> 01:47:01.840]   because he was, because someone hit him in school
[01:47:01.840 --> 01:47:02.920]   because he took something from them
[01:47:02.920 --> 01:47:04.320]   and then they hit him in the arm.
[01:47:04.320 --> 01:47:06.000]   And I said, is there a scar?
[01:47:06.000 --> 01:47:07.480]   Do you have any blood?
[01:47:07.480 --> 01:47:08.320]   Were you bleeding?
[01:47:08.320 --> 01:47:09.160]   Did we have to take you to the hospital?
[01:47:09.160 --> 01:47:10.000]   And he's like, well, no.
[01:47:10.000 --> 01:47:13.320]   And I said, okay, then it really wasn't a hit, was it?
[01:47:13.320 --> 01:47:15.520]   You know, and he's like, okay, I'm ready to go to school.
[01:47:15.520 --> 01:47:17.440]   (laughing)
[01:47:17.440 --> 01:47:19.840]   That's the country boy way of handling it.
[01:47:19.840 --> 01:47:22.480]   Like, there's no cuts then we're all fine.
[01:47:22.480 --> 01:47:24.640]   So I don't know what kind of father that makes me.
[01:47:24.640 --> 01:47:27.680]   But anyway, Andy, where can people find you?
[01:47:28.640 --> 01:47:32.520]   As usual, anoffgo.com, my website has links to all the cool stuff
[01:47:32.520 --> 01:47:33.920]   that I'm doing, hopefully online.
[01:47:33.920 --> 01:47:35.480]   Suntimes.com has my column,
[01:47:35.480 --> 01:47:37.920]   usually about four to six times a month,
[01:47:37.920 --> 01:47:39.440]   at least one week.
[01:47:39.440 --> 01:47:44.440]   And also, whenever the pigs or squirrel can all be there,
[01:47:44.440 --> 01:47:46.880]   wherever there's injustice in the world, I'll be there.
[01:47:46.880 --> 01:47:49.680]   I'm like sort of a jode of the tech world.
[01:47:49.680 --> 01:47:51.440]   At least that's how I'm marketing myself.
[01:47:51.440 --> 01:47:54.800]   I'm trying to rebrand for traditional life.
[01:47:54.800 --> 01:47:55.760]   - All right.
[01:47:55.760 --> 01:47:58.760]   And with that, break time is over, get back to work.
[01:47:58.760 --> 01:48:02.340]   (upbeat music)
[01:48:02.340 --> 01:48:04.920]   (upbeat music)
[01:48:04.920 --> 01:48:07.500]   (upbeat music)
[01:48:07.500 --> 01:48:10.080]   (upbeat music)
