[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   or last week, sudden case of, well, something.
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   A foodborne illness, I believe, took me out last week.
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   But thank you, Mike. You did a great job. Andy Enoco is back from the Chicago Sun Times. Welcome, Andy.
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   Chicken sushi is never a deal, no matter what the price.
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   [laughter]
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   Also, Renee Richie from Montreal. Hello, Renee.
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   Hey, Leo, how are you doing?
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   Hi, more.com. We had the serenity call to go on Twitter and Sunday, and remind me how mad I am at you for stealing serenity away.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   She's just awesome. She has her own agency, but she is terrific.
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   Yes. She still is in Boston, and doesn't, you know, she didn't have to move to Montreal or anything.
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   Nope. Are you having, I understand there's a Nor Easter.
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   [laughter]
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   There's a Nor colder, whatever. Nor Easter. So both, I guess, the eastern seaboard suffering a little bit of a storm right now.
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   Yeah, we got like rain like hell all day today, which is fine if you have just lots of little errands to run inside the house,
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   as opposed to the laryn's outside the house. Yes. Run errands inside the house today.
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   That's a great idea. We're going to have our own little four-year storm on Thursday.
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   Yeah. We're cold, so it's not raining and snowing.
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000]   [laughter]
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   Yikes. Andy Solid Form.
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:39.000]   It was a little bit of a tempest this week in the stock market. Apple stock draw. I looked at the Apple stock price.
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   I think yesterday, the day before, and I went, "What the heck happened? It's coming back up now. It's to 1.13."
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   Yeah. It very briefly just took a dive on December, well, I guess it started December 8th.
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   Phew. And everybody's wondering, "What the heck? What happened? Why was Apple at 115 on Friday and down to 110 on Tuesday?"
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   Well, the thinking is now it was high frequency trading. It was program trading.
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:19.000]   Yeah. I heard a statistic just the other day that we're asked about 15 or 20 years ago.
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:26.000]   I'm sorry, a period of time ago, the average length at which a stock was held before being sold was something like four years,
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.000]   and now it's 10 seconds. [laughter]
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   So maybe this has an effect upon the economy that we don't really have it really thought through.
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:41.000]   Yeah. And that's because the average is brought down by these machines that do trades over microseconds of time.
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000]   Yeah. Great. Michael Lewis, Tyler and I.
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   What pressure for a CEO? You've got eight seconds to perform before the stockholder says, "I have no faith anymore."
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:05:03.000]   It started, well, with a volume, I mean, it could be institutional, but 6% drop, its largest drop in three months.
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   Unusual rise in volume, often the case that that's either program trading.
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   You just wonder how smart they are. If one computer says sell one, it gets to this price, another one says sell one,
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:17.000]   this guy sells, another one said if the price goes down by this much sell, and then all the other computer algorithms start triggering,
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000]   one after the other like a domino.
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:25.000]   Well, that's right. And it wasn't just Apple. In fact, there were about 60-- or I'm sorry, 300 stocks that had this kind of volatile,
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:31.000]   odd price volatility. It's something you see a lot now. But Apple, in fact, Michael Lewis in his book,
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   which is wonderful, highly recommended flash boys. Is flash boys?
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:46.000]   That talks about Apple particularly as an example. It's the kind of stock that is perfect for high frequency trading.
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:54.000]   Flash boys is such a good book on this. Anyway, nothing to worry about. Nothing to fear here. It's coming back up,
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:06:02.000]   and that's not really anything anybody who's investing in Apple or wondering how Apple's going to do anything from.
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   Just thought I'd mention that.
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:14.000]   Let's talk about the lawsuit. Last I heard this morning, they needed a new plaintiff.
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   Yes. All right, so the lawsuit which has been going on now for 10 years, right?
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:28.000]   Something like that. It affects-- it's referring to iPod sold in a timeframe from 2006 to 2008.
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:33.000]   And there seemed to be two complaints, or at least I've read two different stories about this.
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:38.000]   The Wall Street Journal said one of the complaints was, and we've all experienced this when you put in an iPod,
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:46.000]   in a new computer it says, "Well, this iPod is associated with iTunes from another computer. You can copy music over,
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:49.000]   but I'm going to erase everything that's on it right now."
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:57.000]   The other complaint is that you couldn't install music from other music stores on it because Apple only supported one form of copy protection.
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:05.000]   It's own fair play, or is it play fair? No, fair play. Play fair is the crack.
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.000]   Play fair is the crack. Play fair was the Microsoft one.
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:15.000]   Right. Well, that's exactly it. You couldn't buy something at the Microsoft store or Napster or Rhapsody or anywhere else.
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.000]   It has its own DRM because it wasn't supported on the iPod.
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:19.000]   Real media? Who?
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   Well, the real who?
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:21.000]   The real who?
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:27.000]   That was never actually true, though. I mean, we were only talking about syncing directly from iTunes.
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:35.000]   It's interesting how difficult it is to explain Apple to the courts because they are a company.
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.000]   They will do things that are definitely their best interests.
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:43.000]   They might even see advantages to keeping things locked up, not just to keep the things secure,
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:48.000]   but to, again, prevent certain inconvenient competition from happening.
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:53.000]   But it's so important. There's no legal basis for explaining to the courts, look,
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:58.000]   our corporate attitude is that we need to maintain control over all the devices we sell.
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:01.000]   We need to maintain control over all the software we sell.
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:06.000]   There is an advantage to the consumers to doing this, but that is simply our way.
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:12.000]   That's how we think of what our responsibility is and what our rights are as creators of stuff
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.000]   is that we want to maintain control of this at all times.
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:18.000]   We want the ability to make sure that nothing is happening on here that we don't approve of
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:22.000]   and that we don't think is healthy for the device or for the user.
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   But when you take that outside of Cupertino, it really does seem like we don't want any competition whatsoever.
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:34.000]   And, again, while I don't doubt that Apple is going to behave as a company that wants to protect its best interests,
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:37.000]   a lot of this really is motivated by a simple desire for control.
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:49.000]   So the suit, which was started in 2005, I don't even remember 2005, continues on even though they keep losing plaintiffs.
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:53.000]   So it's a class action lawsuit, but you need actually one real person with this problem.
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:57.000]   And they disqualified, one of them withdrew last week.
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:02.000]   They disqualified the other saying, well, she in fact did not buy an iPod in that time period.
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000]   She didn't have her, she didn't have receipt.
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.000]   She was in court.
[00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:10.000]   So she said, but she said, but I have the iPod right here.
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.000]   So the Apple said, well, can we see that?
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:19.000]   They wrote down the serial number, then they did a little research and said, nope, you bought that after the time period of this lawsuit.
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:23.000]   So then she went back, she said, well, no, I've been filing that for David.
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:27.000]   I bought two on September 8th, what was it, 2008.
[00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:32.000]   And then they said, well, you bought it with a credit card from your husband's law firm.
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.000]   So you didn't buy it anyway.
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:35.000]   Eight.
[00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:40.000]   So, but this one person represents a class of eight million.
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:45.000]   They're seeking 350 million, although there could be additional punitive damages.
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:49.000]   The judge declined to throw it out yesterday.
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:53.000]   Judge Evang Gonzales Rogers is holding a hearing today.
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:54.000]   This is a jury case.
[00:09:54.000 --> 00:10:00.000]   So she's shunted the jury out and is now holding a hearing, hoping to find somebody else.
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.000]   She says, it's too big.
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:03.000]   We can't just throw this out.
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:07.000]   We've got to give the council a chance to find more people.
[00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:13.000]   And in fact, the plaintiff's counsel says, oh, we got lots of people who over the weekend said, yeah, I'll join this.
[00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:16.000]   You think they would have found this earlier on in the process?
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.000]   Well, that's what the judge said.
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.000]   You didn't really do your job.
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:25.000]   On the other hand, I can't punish those eight million iPod buyers because you guys are doofuses.
[00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:33.000]   Although you have to, I think in a case like this is the law firm that's bringing this because they're going to get 60% of the proceeds.
[00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:38.000]   This is, you know, it's a very lucrative little business.
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:50.000]   The sad thing to me is they managed in this whole thing to get on Steve Jobs literally on his deathbed just months before he passed away in 2011 to record a videotape deposition.
[00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:57.000]   You know, the last thing I'm sure Steve wanted to do and in which he says, we haven't seen it yet.
[00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:03.000]   Although it may be released, which I think would be, I don't know, maybe it'd be too more, but I think there'd be people interested in seeing it.
[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:06.000]   But he said, look, we didn't have a choice.
[00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:11.000]   The record companies say that we have to do this.
[00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:19.000]   He said, every time the DRM is cracked, literally a clock starts ticking and we have a few days to fix it and release the fix.
[00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:26.000]   The threat the record companies hold over our heads is that they will pull the music from the iTunes store and literally put the iTunes store out of business.
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:29.000]   He said, this was the deal we made with the record companies.
[00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:34.000]   The record company said the iPod is a massive piracy device.
[00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:45.000]   And if you don't somehow prohibit people from taking the iPod over to their friends house and saying, here, have 160 gigs of music, then we're not going to sell stuff in the iTunes store.
[00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:55.000]   They're doing that today. If you change your iTunes match login, you can't change it again for 90 days because they don't want you to go to someone else's house, put in their login, download all their music, then go to someone else's place, put in their login.
[00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:57.000]   Not everything has changed.
[00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:58.000]   Yeah.
[00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:08.000]   Well, but to be fair, that certainly addresses the issue of locking up anything that can be termed a security problem with the device.
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:18.000]   The idea of being able to load music into the device from a competing music service, however, is not the same thing as getting music off of it.
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:26.000]   But if he was speaking of wording in the contract, that somebody said, if there's a security problem and we can define security problem, however we want, yeah, then that definitely falls under that.
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:36.000]   This is why whenever we really not just for the Apple book with any other company, when we look at why is this company doing something that's so bizarre or something that seems so stupid.
[00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:40.000]   You don't know if there is some sort of legal requirement for them to do that.
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:49.000]   I think I'm not, I myself might have dinged early versions of Android for gosh, what a weird behavior, what a not intuitive way to scroll.
[00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:59.000]   And then through that lawsuit, funnily enough, we find out that no, there was an agreement or rather there was a there was patent problems with doing things the most natural and obvious way possible.
[00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:07.000]   So they had to do something in the third or fourth best way simply to avoid legal issues. So it's so it's anytime that we're talking about this, this sort of stuff.
[00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:17.000]   We have to avoid avoid phrases like, Oh, man, these people, they just don't get apple just doesn't get it. You know, like, they're going to be buried because they still want to innovate.
[00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:27.000]   They don't want to change like, No, there's a lot. You know, if you were inside of Apple, you probably also would not understand the real reasons why they have to do things because it's sometimes it's three or four or five layers deep.
[00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:38.000]   It's interesting too, because Apple did support other music stores as long as it was DRM free when Amazon started up with their DRM music that was, you know, DRM free music that was even cheaper, 89 cents, that easily went on the iPod.
[00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:50.000]   You just dragged it into iTunes, dragged it on, but it took spec Apple to support plays for sure, which had, you know, historically had tremendous problems, including shutting down and basically making people in some sort of the zoom.
[00:13:50.000 --> 00:14:01.000]   It didn't, it didn't, that was made by Microsoft. Right. Yes, it had to support that. And then you have to support Reels DRM and how many, what size companies do you have to support? Isn't it fair if you support some and not others?
[00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:08.000]   These are all just, and it's non trivial to what that does to your software stack supporting your own stuff is easy. Well, you have to support everyone else's stuff.
[00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:10.000]   It doesn't seem like a reasonable sort of thing. I think it was.
[00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:18.000]   It was also justified in the case that supporting multiple DRMs on the same device be like making a car with two or three steering wheels.
[00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:29.000]   Well, on your subject to them, I mean, if Microsoft's plays for sure gets, gets broken, cracked, is it Apple's responsibility? Now the iPod is again a piracy machine. What does that do with their relationships with music company?
[00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:35.000]   Do you think Jobs and Apple wanted DRM to go away, but this was a deal that they had to do with the Devos?
[00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:48.000]   Yes. Yeah. I've even said that, didn't he? Yeah, exactly. That's the story. They've been telling pretty much from the beginning that if they could have got, if they could have talked to record companies into launching without DRM, that's what they would have done.
[00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:56.000]   They felt that was a price of getting this thing launched. And I think that even they knew that DRM was not going to last more than a year or two.
[00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:12.000]   I'd like to. It's kind of ironic that one of the reasons why the Amazon MP3 store got such a toehold was because the iTunes store was becoming such a monster hit and it was basically becoming, for like better word, the iTunes of digital music.
[00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:30.000]   And the only way that music companies could sort of claim back some of their power and not put all of their eggs in the iTunes basket was to not only help out Amazon and do deals with them, but also give them something that the iTunes store did not have at that point, which was DRM free music downloads.
[00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:41.000]   And then that had to spread everything else. Does the iPod still do that thing where if you have linked it to one iTunes and then you connect it to another computer, does it still say I'm going to erase your data?
[00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:49.000]   For video. So it depends on what it is for anything that is still with Fair Play DRM, which includes music, which includes movies, TV shows and apps and games.
[00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:54.000]   You can have five computers linked to it or up to 10 devices. We'll ask you to do register.
[00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:59.000]   So you don't have that same issue though, which really was kind of horrible.
[00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:04.000]   And I have many people call say, oh, I accidentally said yes, and now I lost all my music.
[00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:11.000]   I've done that, but that's not the case anymore. You have up to five and it won't say it'll just say, hey, you've reached your limit of five.
[00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:15.000]   Yeah, before you get to five, it'll let you unselect some of the devices or unregister some of the devices.
[00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:19.000]   When you get to five, I'll let you unregister all of them and then read, register the ones that you want.
[00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:23.000]   And the 10 devices include Apple TVs and iPhones and iPads on top of those computers.
[00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:30.000]   Certainly DRM is always a bad idea. I don't think anybody at this point thinks it's a good idea except the people who are using it.
[00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:38.000]   And it's pretty really clear to me that DRM doesn't slow down pirates in any way.
[00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:44.000]   It only inhibits honest users. It only gets to be a normal.
[00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:48.000]   Steve Jobs' thoughts on music letter that he wrote so famously and put it up.
[00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:56.000]   And it's true to this day. I have a 7.1 receiver sitting here that I can't use because no matter what I hook up to it, it gives me HDCP content errors.
[00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:00.000]   So it just blocks it saying it's illegal content with our Biden iTunes, played on a PlayStation 3.
[00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:04.000]   And that's perfectly works except for the HDCP chip.
[00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:14.000]   Right. Yeah, I mean, coincidentally, like this is the perfect place for like this to come up because when I'm not using this computer for podcasting, I'm using it to rip DVDs, rip Blu-rays.
[00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:18.000]   And I bought a whole bunch like off of Amazon sales and stuff like that.
[00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:36.000]   It does not even occur to me to purchase movies from digital movies through the iTunes store or the Amazon video store because I would much rather buy this and break the DRM and then be able to put it on my server, be able to put out on my Android phones, put it on my iPads,
[00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:40.000]   and have that much control over it, then then then buy DRM content.
[00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:42.000]   So it's absolutely true.
[00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:55.000]   It encourages me to break the, to become a, I buy these things legitimately and then break the DRM, but breaking the DRM is still something that legally is somewhat suspect.
[00:17:55.000 --> 00:18:05.000]   But it's a much rather break the DRM through tools that are out there and easy and affordable, then deal with everything that the DRM content forces me to go through.
[00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:08.000]   It's just, and it's just not useful.
[00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:15.000]   When you load it up, when you go to Apple TV and you buy a movie or you rent a movie and you press the button, it puts up that authorizing label.
[00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:18.000]   And that just makes me feel like a criminal. I just hate that word so much.
[00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:24.000]   And also, and also, and also when it breaks, it totally, you feel like you've been cheated a little bit.
[00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:29.000]   I had fortunately the George TK documentary was good enough that I would want to watch it twice.
[00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:45.000]   But, you know, I rented it on the desktop, desktop iTunes, and then because I haven't rented movies and iTunes in like years, I've discovered that, oh, I can't, my Apple TV isn't automatically aware that I've rented this movie already.
[00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:49.000]   But it will let me rent it a second time through the interface on the Apple TV.
[00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:51.000]   I'm like, okay, whatever.
[00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:52.000]   I'll go ahead.
[00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:53.000]   I'll spend another three bucks.
[00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:59.000]   Yeah, and that's, there's a story like that for pretty much every user who has to deal with DRM content.
[00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:00.000]   I have paid for this.
[00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:06.000]   You should be allowing me to watch this, but now you're simply through a failure of the software that manages the system.
[00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:09.000]   I am not getting access to what I've paid for.
[00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:19.000]   And that, once again, sends you towards, or I could simply do something that the industry does not want me to do, which is to produce a digital copy that I can then have fun with however I want.
[00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:23.000]   What do you use just curiosity to back up?
[00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:29.000]   I'm sorry, no close to back up your Blu-ray discs.
[00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:38.000]   There is a really useful utility called make MKV, which gets rid of the blue, the copper protection on the Blu-ray.
[00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:48.000]   And then it's, and then it, if all by itself, you can use it to spit out backup files of all the data that's on the Blu-ray, but then you hook that up to,
[00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:58.000]   to handbrake, and handbrake will now, well then, once you have used this tool to essentially act as the go between, between the operating system and the disc,
[00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:04.000]   you can then go to handbrake and then it will just be able to rip all those files directly.
[00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:05.000]   Even Blu-rays?
[00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:06.000]   Even Blu-rays.
[00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:08.000]   It's a two or three step process.
[00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:17.000]   If you do it the easiest way, meaning that you use the, use make MKV to spit out the files onto your hard disk and then handbrake.
[00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:20.000]   It converts those files into something useful.
[00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:28.000]   However, there is some command line mojo you can do that will let handbrake see the libraries that make MKV has.
[00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:33.000]   So it really does become put in the Blu-ray drive, let, and make MKV chew on it for half a minute.
[00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:38.000]   And then once it's done chewing on it, handbrake can then rip it directly from the Blu-ray drive.
[00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:43.000]   You do have to make sure you have a drive that's compatible with, at make MKV.
[00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:54.000]   Most of them are, and most of those are, I have this cheap $30 drive, no name OEM drive that I got off of Amazon for, again, like, $35.
[00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:56.000]   And it's just easiest pie.
[00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:58.000]   It works, it works easily.
[00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:03.000]   I always, I always use, I use handbrake to create two different copies of it.
[00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:08.000]   One at full HD resolution and then another one that's at like lower resolution.
[00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:13.000]   That's, that's more portable for phones and for tablets and stuff like that.
[00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:19.000]   And so the high definition, the super high def version goes on to my media server and plays through my Roku, plays through everything else.
[00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:25.000]   And then the other one just goes on to a file server and so I can just sync it directly onto literally everything that I own.
[00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:27.000]   And that's the reason why I do that.
[00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:32.000]   If you go to github.com/donmelton, he's made some amazing scripts to automate a lot of this stuff.
[00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:38.000]   And he's the kind of guy who will make sure that the blacks and saving private Ryan are rendered as black as possible.
[00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:40.000]   Yeah, that's the video file solution.
[00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:58.000]   It's not terribly easy, but he has scripts for like here is, here is a, here's how to manage, here's a script that manages the settings to create a digital copy that is similar to what Apple or Amazon or whatever would create for commercial streaming.
[00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:07.000]   And so I don't use it only because I really want this to be like putting a slice of toast and a toaster and getting toast four minutes later.
[00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:18.000]   And so I just like, you know, I will, I will truly like, I'll go to most of these are, went to a, my usual comic book store that had like just bins and bins of really good DVDs for like five bucks.
[00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:23.000]   And so I tend to like just have a stack of like a dozen of these going at any one time.
[00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:29.000]   And also do you rip all of them every, you know, every three, all three hundred of them every two days like he does different right.
[00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:29.000]   Right.
[00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:30.000]   Right.
[00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:33.000]   So yeah, I mean, I, I encourage people to do that because it's simple.
[00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:34.000]   It's cheap.
[00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:43.000]   And the limitations of DRM being locked into only playing stuff on Apple or Amazon compatible devices is just intolerable.
[00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:52.000]   I couldn't, the, the, the, I watch movies and enjoy movies so much more by virtue of the fact that it is simply a file on a server that any device on my network that connects to the device.
[00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:58.000]   On my network that can access a file on a server can either stream directly or simply copy and then I can take it out of the house.
[00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:00.000]   Why would you want something less than that?
[00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:09.000]   That's the second complaint about DRM is that it encourages everybody to do what we just did, which is teach everybody how to be a pirate.
[00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:10.000]   Exactly.
[00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:15.000]   Because you, quite reasonably wish to have an unencumbered copy of a movie you purchased.
[00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:17.000]   I mean, we're not, I'm not advocating this.
[00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:18.000]   I just want to be able to watch it.
[00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:19.000]   I just want to watch it.
[00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:24.000]   I just feel like there's a, there's a, there's a legal component and there's an ethical component.
[00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:36.000]   I am absolutely not ethically troubled whatsoever with buying a copy of Raised Lost Art, converting it to a file, never letting other people have that file, but allowing, you know, I have no ethical problems with that whatsoever.
[00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:37.000]   I don't think.
[00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:38.000]   Nor do I.
[00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:43.000]   I bought a ton of Blu-ray's that don't play now just because one of the Blu-ray players I had scratched them all.
[00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:48.000]   I was like, one of the TV series I didn't realize till later, I just took one of them out, put the next one in.
[00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:49.000]   I can't play anything man.
[00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:50.000]   I think it was the West Wing or something.
[00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:51.000]   I can't play any of them anymore.
[00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:52.000]   I went and rebought all of them.
[00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:53.000]   You should have the right.
[00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:55.000]   And I think you do have, well, certainly in Canada you have the right.
[00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:59.000]   And I think even in the United States you have the right to make archival backups of your digital media.
[00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:00.000]   I think I'm an idiot.
[00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:07.000]   I'm no lawyer and I don't even care because as you say, Andy, it's just right that you should be able to do that.
[00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:08.000]   Yeah.
[00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:15.000]   We're going to take a break coming back.
[00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:16.000]   If you've been worried about the long-term viability of solid-state drives, there's some very good news for you.
[00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:21.000]   And Mark Zuckerberg says, "Apple is ridiculous."
[00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:25.000]   Ridiculously profitable.
[00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:27.000]   Am I right, shareholders?
[00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:30.000]   We'll talk about that in just a little bit.
[00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:32.000]   Our show today brought to you by Oscar.
[00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:33.000]   Hi, Oscar.
[00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:37.000]   Oscar, if you live in New York or New Jersey, although I'm told that they're,
[00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:42.000]   this is a pilot program that they plan to roll out in a lot larger area.
[00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:46.000]   If you're looking for health insurance, this is kind of the Internet's answer to health insurance.
[00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:50.000]   They focus on everyday people as their customers, not big companies.
[00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:56.000]   They're using technology to make health insurance simpler, more intuitive, and more human.
[00:24:56.000 --> 00:25:00.000]   These are engineers, people who work to Tumblr, Spotify, and Google.
[00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:04.000]   They're really trying to make a better way to buy and use health insurance.
[00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:09.000]   For instance, as part of their app, they have a personal timeline that lets you track your medical history,
[00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:14.000]   including doctor appointments, visit notes, prescriptions, telemedicine is supported by Oscar.
[00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:15.000]   Phone calls with a doctor.
[00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:18.000]   It also helps you find doctors and care in your area.
[00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:20.000]   Man, I wish they had it out here.
[00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:23.000]   It's searched by location, languages, spoken, hospital affiliation.
[00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:25.000]   iOS version is out now.
[00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:26.000]   Androids coming out next month.
[00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:33.000]   Oscar is using technology to provide better care to individuals and their families and to make quality care more accessible.
[00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:43.000]   If you're lucky enough to be living in New Jersey or New York, Oscar's doctor on call gives you access to a board certified doctor 24/7.
[00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:45.000]   It's like having a doctor in the family.
[00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:47.000]   But you've got to be in New York and Jersey right now.

[00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:37.000]   Let me see if I can find it because I just erased it.
[00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:42.000]   If you've ever bought an SSD and nowadays when you buy a new Mac book, you're buying an SSD.
[00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:47.000]   No, I don't want to update the Adobe Flash Player.
[00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:48.000]   Go away.
[00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:51.000]   I said no and it's still downloaded it.
[00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:52.000]   That's annoying.
[00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:57.000]   I must have gone to a pirate site.
[00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:00.000]   This is the tech report doing this.
[00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:09.000]   More than a year ago, get this, they picked six solid state drives for, they say, a suicide mission.
[00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:12.000]   We were curious how many rights could survive before burning out.
[00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:16.000]   Really, that's what something a lot of people have been worried about is if you have an SSD,
[00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:19.000]   is it going to be less long lived than a spinning hard drive?
[00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:24.000]   We also wanted to track how each one's performance characteristics and health statistics change
[00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:31.000]   as the rights accumulate and somewhat morbidly we wanted to watch what happened when the drives finally expired.
[00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:41.000]   So far, the Corsair Neutron GTX, the Intel 335, the Kingston HyperX and the Samsung 840 all have died.
[00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:46.000]   However, each went far farther than their official spec.
[00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:49.000]   So that's the good news. All went longer than the spec.
[00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:54.000]   In fact, went much longer than you'd probably have any occasion to use them for.
[00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:59.000]   The last victim fell at 1.2 petabytes of rights.
[00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:10.000]   But now they've got two still alive, the 840 Pro and a HyperX 3K have reached two petabytes of rights.
[00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:17.000]   Now, it's kind of hard to put that in perspective, but the author says to give you an idea,
[00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:23.000]   the solid state drives in my main desktop over several years have logged less than two terabytes.
[00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:27.000]   So we're talking a thousand times more.
[00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:33.000]   He says, this rail will take me a thousand years to reach two petabytes.
[00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:36.000]   So this is really good news. This is rights only.
[00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:40.000]   But reads are non-destructive right on SSDs. This is rights only.
[00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:45.000]   So very good news. If you've been a little bit worried, I still get calls.
[00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:50.000]   I want the speed of SSDs. I love the idea. There's no moving parts, the lower power.
[00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:56.000]   But how long are they going to last? Very, very long time.
[00:28:56.000 --> 00:29:03.000]   And because there's no spinning parts, I think you could now say pretty conclusively longer than a spinning drive.
[00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:06.000]   Yeah, I mean, I love it. I was doing some maintenance.
[00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:09.000]   I was traveling over the weekend and I needed to free up some.
[00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:14.000]   I had an experience that showed both the advantages and the disadvantages of SSD
[00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:20.000]   because stupidly when I bought my new MacBook last year, I didn't think I'd be using it as much as I am.
[00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:23.000]   And so I didn't just totally max out the internal drive.
[00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:29.000]   So it only has a 256 gigabyte SSD, which means that it's always running out of space.
[00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:35.000]   So I had to copy lots and lots and lots of files off of it onto what I now use as my travel pocket drive,
[00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:39.000]   which is an external SSD. And so that's the bad news.
[00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:48.000]   The good news is that copies are happening so fast that I'm pretty sure that the finder is buggy.
[00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:53.000]   You know, where I got here's a 500 megabyte video file or 300 megabyte.
[00:29:53.000 --> 00:30:00.000]   I'll just drag like 700 megabytes of stuff. And by the time I let go of the let go of the pointer, it's done.
[00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:04.000]   And I'm actually open. I actually have to open it. I'm serious.
[00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:06.000]   It's like, I'm not thinking that there's a pause and that's done.
[00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:12.000]   I mean that I let go and I don't even see a progress bar and I have to like double click on the external drive
[00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:18.000]   to make sure the file is actually there. So this is this is and you're right.
[00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:25.000]   There's a lot of fear about long longevity of SSDs. A lot of times when you look online for this information,
[00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:31.000]   you find that you're talking about deep deep deep analysis that's intended for people who are buying SSDs
[00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:38.000]   for server use and really really intense server use as opposed to consumers for which really they're almost almost
[00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:45.000]   they all work incredibly well. Any name brand SSD is going to be so long lived that you will the heat death
[00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:52.000]   of the universe will come before the end of your life before the end of this device. So just buy it and enjoy it.
[00:30:52.000 --> 00:31:00.000]   Jeff Gasier is writing this the tech report is at techreport.com. And there's a lot more detail about error handling
[00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:06.000]   and so forth. And so it's it's a good read. And I have to say our SSD expert from PC perspective, Alan
[00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:15.000]   Malvin tonneau has been telling me that the the the new Samsung EVO 850 pro is the one to watch. This is the
[00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:24.000]   first SSD drive to use a new kind of NAND technology called VNAND. He is very bullish on this and the price is
[00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:32.000]   really plumbative from Samsung 128 gigs is $119. So we're now below bucket gigabyte.
[00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:43.000]   256 gigs, $189. They have a terabyte version of the EVO 850 pro for 659. And I think that is a very exciting
[00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:50.000]   price. So and Alan says he's he this is the drive he's currently recommending is the 850. It also solves some of the
[00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:57.000]   trim issues that the 840 had some of the slowdown issues. So this this is this is the drive drive to get.
[00:31:57.000 --> 00:32:04.000]   I don't think it's is it available now? It's so it's it's imminently available on this new technology.
[00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:11.000]   Pretty impressive. Good news. Good news. The hard drive folks have always been blown me away.
[00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:16.000]   Solid state future Leo. We're all going to live in a solid state world.
[00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:22.000]   No more tube storage or magnetic course for us. No, you're in the book atomic jet.
[00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:31.000]   Next time you're at the brick house, I have hanging on the wall a big thing of core memory. Oh, nice. Yeah. And it's not very much. But I mean, it's
[00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:38.000]   huge. I mean, might be 2k because they're actually little magnetic cores with wires going this way in this way. I remember the trays of punch
[00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:50.000]   cars. My dad had a B M. I was like, this you have some. Oh, there you go. Nice. So core memory, baby. We have always have to like, I always like to have about one
[00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:57.000]   K of backup storage in case. Make that a medallion and you just wear that around like a right around your neck. Yeah, I love it.
[00:32:57.000 --> 00:33:07.000]   Core memory, baby. Actually, this is more this is more like bites than K, but we live in amazing, amazing times and it's so easy. Take it for granted.
[00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:16.000]   Like Louis, he could probably read the binary off that thing. Yeah, you could. Yeah, it's probably still good, especially since I keep it in such
[00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:30.000]   an impressive archival archival storage. But yeah, like I was buying I was buying stuff online for over the past week and like like 64 gigabyte memory cards kept going on sale for like incredibly low amounts of money.
[00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:45.000]   And I realized that now SD cards storage is so cheap now that I don't even bother to delete anything off of a camera card. I buy 64 32 or 64 gig cards. When they're full, I simply label them and put them in a box.
[00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:55.000]   And those like act as like the fourth backup and like the absolutely untouched, unedited, every crappy photo, even the ones that I took accidentally is always there.
[00:33:55.000 --> 00:34:00.000]   That's how cheap these things are. And you think about how difficult was to get 16 K back in the day.
[00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:11.000]   I was watching last night. I was playing with the new music key YouTube ability to play videos without ads, you know, and stuff and I was chromecasting it to my big screen TV.
[00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:19.000]   And I was kind of in the mood. We started watching Michael Jackson videos of watching thriller video 1983. And I mean, I remember what a big deal that was.
[00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:26.000]   And then I was just reading an article about Nintendo 1983 was when Nintendo came out with its first game machine.
[00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:32.000]   The NES. We have come a long way since 1983.
[00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:38.000]   You know, Leo, but I have I have an explanation for you that will depress the hell out of you. You're ready for it.
[00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:47.000]   Yeah. 1983 was three decades ago. Oh, wait a minute. Oh my God. I can't be. I was thinking much as happened.
[00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:57.000]   It happened over 30 years. Leo. But I was when I was when I was in school, then you know, Casablanca was only like what? Five years old.
[00:34:57.000 --> 00:35:07.000]   Mm-hmm. The world's moving. I went to see last week, last Friday, went to see Stevie Wonder perform the entire songs in the key of life.
[00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:17.000]   Now, almost 40 years old, that album, but that album has not aged. It is what a phenomenal concert that was.
[00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:28.000]   Best concert I've seen in years. Mark Zuckerberg. Okay. So this is good. So the new. Okay. The battle used to be Steve Jobs, Eric Schmidt, Apple Google, right?
[00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:37.000]   It is. Now, Apple's kind of buried the hatchet and not in Google's back, but just in the ground. Yeah, you know, no more lawsuits.
[00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:48.000]   However, there seems to be a brewing rivalry between Apple and Facebook. Remember in September when Tim Cook was talking about the new iPhones.
[00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:58.000]   He said, if he said, quote, a few years ago, users of Internet services began to realize that when an online service is free, you're not the customer. You're the product.
[00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:11.000]   You know, that's an old saw. And of course, promoting Apple's commitment to privacy. Our product is our hardware. We make money on that. We don't need to make money on you.
[00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:20.000]   Which I think is a pretty fair statement. Zuckerberg says that's ridiculous and Apple's products are overpriced.
[00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:32.000]   Recent interview with Time magazine, he says, Apple is actually making it. And this isn't wrong either. Apple is making products that are exclusionary because they're overpriced.
[00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:41.000]   I mean, Facebook's making products that are exclusionary if you don't want to share your data. Right. If you don't, it's free as long as you don't mind sharing your data.
[00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:53.000]   You can pay with money with time with data or with attention. And money is really easy to see. The rest are more abstract. But if I choose not to share data, then Facebook is exclusionary to me the same way if I choose not to share money. Apple is exclusionary to me.
[00:36:53.000 --> 00:37:04.000]   Yeah, that's a good point. That's why I don't like it. I don't even like claims that, oh, well, you realize that we don't care about your about about selling your data.
[00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:22.000]   We only want to support you as a consumer and have you buy our next wave of products. And that's true as far as it goes. But if you wanted to turn, if you wanted to turn that around and say things about Apple, the way that Apple's saying things about the company, you could say, you see here at Google here at Facebook, we don't need to, we don't try to lock you into
[00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:35.000]   one platform to make it really hard for you not to pay us for another high markup piece of hardware. If you want to come in with a $200 Walmart laptop, that's fine. If you want to come in with a $4,000 gaming laptop, that's fine too.
[00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:51.000]   We give you the choice. We realize there are people at all, all different price levels. And I mean, that's not intended as a complaint against Apple, but as, okay, there's a factual point to be made there, but let's also realize that you're only looking at 10% of the
[00:37:51.000 --> 00:38:01.000]   picture there. But to be fair, to be fair to Mark, this is an interview by Lev Grossman Time magazine in which they're talking to Mark in India about bringing the Internet via Internet.org to the developing nations and talking about poverty and how, you know, these people are absolutely not going to be buying iPhones. They're not going to be buying iMacs. And I think you could praise Mark for saying, well, maybe we can get them something and Google is going to be
[00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:17.000]   with Loon and so forth. Maybe we can get some Internet access to them. And yes, we're going to make money off of it because we're going to wire the world and there'll be commerce opportunities and
[00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:19.020]   And I think you could praise Mark for saying,
[00:38:19.020 --> 00:38:22.940]   well maybe we can get them something and Google with loon and so forth,
[00:38:22.940 --> 00:38:27.180]   maybe we can get some internet access to them and yes, we're gonna make money off of it
[00:38:27.180 --> 00:38:32.000]   because we're gonna wire the world and there'll be commerce opportunities and advertising opportunities.
[00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:38.360]   But Apple doesn't have a strategy for getting iPhones into developing nations.
[00:38:38.360 --> 00:38:42.240]   >>Yeah it's not their business, their business is the higher end premium market,
[00:38:42.240 --> 00:38:44.820]   they've chosen not to really compete in that market.
[00:38:44.820 --> 00:38:49.000]   But just to the other point, I mean if I use Facebook, it's not trivial to take all my stuff and move it to Google
[00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:50.960]   if I suddenly have an objection to Facebook.
[00:38:50.960 --> 00:38:54.720]   Everybody, that's why Mark Zuckerberg wants to wire the world because he wants to do it before Google does
[00:38:54.720 --> 00:38:56.140]   because he wants to invest it in Facebook.
[00:38:56.140 --> 00:38:57.900]   And it's hard to move to Google from there.
[00:38:57.900 --> 00:39:01.120]   So it always is about using my products.
[00:39:01.120 --> 00:39:04.880]   The analogy I like to use and it's a horrible analogy is that if I'm having dinner,
[00:39:04.880 --> 00:39:08.460]   like if I go out to eat with Andy, we pay for our dinners, that's one thing.
[00:39:08.460 --> 00:39:11.440]   It does cost me money but I've paid for my dinner and we can both leave.
[00:39:11.440 --> 00:39:15.340]   If the restaurant gives us a lobster dinner and we're eating it and they don't charge us for it,
[00:39:15.340 --> 00:39:19.020]   but then just sit there leering at us, maybe that's fine for me but maybe it's not.
[00:39:19.020 --> 00:39:22.840]   It all depends on what sort of barter because you're bartering again money time.
[00:39:22.840 --> 00:39:28.660]   >>There's the analogy I would use that speaks to what my situation.
[00:39:28.660 --> 00:39:31.460]   In fact, Mike Elgin was the one who suggested this to me.
[00:39:31.460 --> 00:39:34.360]   He said, you know, there are two kinds of media.
[00:39:34.360 --> 00:39:36.660]   There's media behind a paywall like the Wall Street Journal.
[00:39:36.660 --> 00:39:39.000]   You have to give them money to read their content.
[00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:41.540]   There's ad supported media like Twit.
[00:39:41.540 --> 00:39:46.460]   Mike was the one who said, "Twit is fundamentally more democratic because anybody can listen
[00:39:46.460 --> 00:39:52.260]   to Twit anywhere if you can get it, if you have a device you could play it on, because
[00:39:52.260 --> 00:39:53.820]   there's no paywall.
[00:39:53.820 --> 00:39:55.180]   So it's fundamentally more democratic.
[00:39:55.180 --> 00:39:56.540]   I like the Twit model better.
[00:39:56.540 --> 00:40:00.100]   I don't want to be behind a paywall for a lot of reasons, not altruistic particularly
[00:40:00.100 --> 00:40:03.380]   but I just don't want to.
[00:40:03.380 --> 00:40:06.740]   I think it's completely reasonable to do as Jessica Lesson has done with the information
[00:40:06.740 --> 00:40:08.820]   to put it to have a paywall.
[00:40:08.820 --> 00:40:10.280]   You're just two different business models.
[00:40:10.280 --> 00:40:13.520]   I don't think they're antagonistic necessarily.
[00:40:13.520 --> 00:40:15.120]   They might even be complementary.
[00:40:15.120 --> 00:40:16.120]   It's nice to have choice.
[00:40:16.120 --> 00:40:19.120]   It's good to have choice.
[00:40:19.120 --> 00:40:20.680]   Andy, I'm sorry I interrupted you.
[00:40:20.680 --> 00:40:24.240]   >>No, no, I was just going to pick up on some stuff that Ray was saying.
[00:40:24.240 --> 00:40:35.000]   I mean, there's the point being that everybody, every company acts to the own best interests
[00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:40.360]   of their business model and every business model is going to be different.
[00:40:40.360 --> 00:40:49.600]   It's like saying that here at McDonald's, we don't try to trick you into buying undercoding
[00:40:49.600 --> 00:40:55.900]   and special wire rims and air conditioning that you can only get if you buy the rally
[00:40:55.900 --> 00:40:57.060]   sport package.
[00:40:57.060 --> 00:41:00.020]   We just want to sell you a hamburger for 99 cents.
[00:41:00.020 --> 00:41:01.820]   Well, okay, big sacrifice.
[00:41:01.820 --> 00:41:03.740]   You're not in the business of selling cars.
[00:41:03.740 --> 00:41:07.040]   This isn't like this is an ethics thing that you're talking about.
[00:41:07.040 --> 00:41:11.080]   You're talking about you and your company and this company are in different businesses.
[00:41:11.080 --> 00:41:17.960]   Just like Ford is going to say, we really aren't interested in tricking you into putting
[00:41:17.960 --> 00:41:21.400]   more processed sugar into your kid's mouth than is healthy for you.
[00:41:21.400 --> 00:41:23.760]   We just want to get your kids to school safely.
[00:41:23.760 --> 00:41:29.000]   I don't know why McDonald's doesn't care about you getting your kids to school safely.
[00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:33.280]   Now, Zuck said, this actually is a great couple of paragraphs.
[00:41:33.280 --> 00:41:36.040]   I'll read from the, from Lev Grossman's article in Time Magazine.
[00:41:36.040 --> 00:41:39.580]   Lev writes, there's something distasteful about the whole business, a global campaign
[00:41:39.580 --> 00:41:45.940]   by a bunch of Silicon Valley jillionaires to convert literally everybody into data consumers
[00:41:45.940 --> 00:41:49.860]   to make sure no eyeballs anywhere go unexposed to their ads.
[00:41:49.860 --> 00:41:54.400]   Everyone must be integrated into the vast cultural homogeneity that is the internet.
[00:41:54.400 --> 00:41:59.400]   It's like a zombie plague, World War Z for Zuckerberg.
[00:41:59.400 --> 00:42:01.480]   And before Alibaba does.
[00:42:01.480 --> 00:42:04.320]   After all, it's not as though anybody asks two thirds of humanity whether they wanted
[00:42:04.320 --> 00:42:05.920]   to be put online.
[00:42:05.920 --> 00:42:07.920]   I bet they do.
[00:42:07.920 --> 00:42:11.040]   It makes one want to say there are still people here on God's green earth who can conduct
[00:42:11.040 --> 00:42:13.440]   their social lives without being marketed to.
[00:42:13.440 --> 00:42:15.760]   Can't we leave them alone?
[00:42:15.760 --> 00:42:20.040]   I erred this point of view to a few Facebook executives.
[00:42:20.040 --> 00:42:21.800]   Predictably, I didn't get a lot of traction.
[00:42:21.800 --> 00:42:25.840]   Zuck's response was internet.org is not about growing Facebook.
[00:42:25.840 --> 00:42:29.640]   For the simple reason, there's no money in showing ads to the people that use the app
[00:42:29.640 --> 00:42:33.600]   because they don't have any.
[00:42:33.600 --> 00:42:34.600]   That's a legitimate point.
[00:42:34.600 --> 00:42:35.600]   Sure.
[00:42:35.600 --> 00:42:37.600]   But I mean, those are growing economies.
[00:42:37.600 --> 00:42:40.920]   And we've seen my private experience that if you get them to see Mickey Mouse in Superman
[00:42:40.920 --> 00:42:45.520]   and the Playboy Bunny and whatever brand it creates affinity for those brands.
[00:42:45.520 --> 00:42:47.080]   It's just you have money.
[00:42:47.080 --> 00:42:48.080]   Absolutely.
[00:42:48.080 --> 00:42:49.080]   Yeah.
[00:42:49.080 --> 00:42:55.040]   Because really one way to make my empesa, which is basically banking for much of undeveloped
[00:42:55.040 --> 00:43:01.080]   Africa, they use their smartphone, not smartphones, dumb phones, feature phones to exchange money,
[00:43:01.080 --> 00:43:02.360]   to store money.
[00:43:02.360 --> 00:43:03.880]   And that's a big business.
[00:43:03.880 --> 00:43:07.040]   A lot of money be made there and lots of small transactions.
[00:43:07.040 --> 00:43:08.040]   Yeah.
[00:43:08.040 --> 00:43:10.880]   And they want them to use Facebook messaging the way they use BBM because it's super cheap
[00:43:10.880 --> 00:43:12.400]   and voice is expensive there.
[00:43:12.400 --> 00:43:15.120]   And because eventually commerce can flow over it.
[00:43:15.120 --> 00:43:16.120]   Yeah.
[00:43:16.120 --> 00:43:18.000]   Look at the line and they buy stickers and they promote games now.
[00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:19.840]   It's not just a messaging service anymore.
[00:43:19.840 --> 00:43:20.840]   Right.
[00:43:20.840 --> 00:43:21.840]   Sorry, Andy.
[00:43:21.840 --> 00:43:25.280]   That's why my basically is over when I hear that.
[00:43:25.280 --> 00:43:29.520]   Oh, you remember that if you get something for free, you're the product.
[00:43:29.520 --> 00:43:31.880]   I think A, I think it's overplayed.
[00:43:31.880 --> 00:43:35.960]   It really is the obey of tech commentary.
[00:43:35.960 --> 00:43:42.480]   But also it indicates it sort of implies that consumers are stupid and that they are
[00:43:42.480 --> 00:43:47.320]   being exploited as opposed to simply saying that I'm okay with this transaction depending
[00:43:47.320 --> 00:43:52.320]   on the services that I'm getting and how much I value them in my lives.
[00:43:52.320 --> 00:43:59.080]   I mean, if a school system wants to standardize on Google Docs as opposed to and that works
[00:43:59.080 --> 00:44:03.920]   out really, really well for Google so long as it's also the best situation for school
[00:44:03.920 --> 00:44:06.320]   systems, that's an okay trade.
[00:44:06.320 --> 00:44:07.320]   Yeah.
[00:44:07.320 --> 00:44:14.480]   A few months after Zuckerberg announced internet.org, Bill Gates appeared to take a contrarian
[00:44:14.480 --> 00:44:19.120]   line in an interview with the Financial Times quote, hmm, which is more important.
[00:44:19.120 --> 00:44:24.240]   Connectivity or malaria vaccine, Gates said, if you think connectivity is the key thing,
[00:44:24.240 --> 00:44:25.240]   that's great.
[00:44:25.240 --> 00:44:26.240]   I don't.
[00:44:26.240 --> 00:44:29.400]   And more succinctly, as a priority, it's a joke.
[00:44:29.400 --> 00:44:30.320]   But Zuck said, you know what?
[00:44:30.320 --> 00:44:31.320]   I called Bill.
[00:44:31.320 --> 00:44:33.720]   Wait a minute.
[00:44:33.720 --> 00:44:35.120]   This is the quote from Zuck.
[00:44:35.120 --> 00:44:38.240]   I called him up and I was like, what's up, dude?
[00:44:38.240 --> 00:44:40.320]   But that's the quote.
[00:44:40.320 --> 00:44:42.240]   But he was misquoted, says Zuck.
[00:44:42.240 --> 00:44:43.400]   He even corrected it afterwards.
[00:44:43.400 --> 00:44:47.640]   He was like, no, I fully believe this is critical.
[00:44:47.640 --> 00:44:48.640]   Like for sure.
[00:44:48.640 --> 00:44:50.440]   Like for sure, man.
[00:44:50.440 --> 00:44:52.000]   So it's not that it's not critical.
[00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:56.120]   If you had a choice, then if you had to choose, but it's a false choice between connectivity
[00:44:56.120 --> 00:44:59.000]   and malaria vaccine, you'd probably choose malaria vaccine, but that's a false choice.
[00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:00.160]   It's not the choice.
[00:45:00.160 --> 00:45:03.000]   I do think though that there's a difference in how traditionally we value like when you
[00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:06.600]   pay something with money, there are people who live beyond their means, but money is
[00:45:06.600 --> 00:45:10.760]   a very tangible thing that you can see in front of you where, at least speaking for myself,
[00:45:10.760 --> 00:45:14.080]   data and attention is something that I can mortgage very easily in the present at the
[00:45:14.080 --> 00:45:15.080]   expense of my future.
[00:45:15.080 --> 00:45:18.440]   And I think it is worthwhile reminding people that no matter what you're buying, no matter
[00:45:18.440 --> 00:45:21.720]   who's modeling or supporting, you are paying in some way, shape or form.
[00:45:21.720 --> 00:45:22.720]   Yeah.
[00:45:22.720 --> 00:45:25.240]   Zuck says our mission is to connect every person in the world.
[00:45:25.240 --> 00:45:30.320]   You don't do that by having a service people pay for.
[00:45:30.320 --> 00:45:31.320]   Not money.
[00:45:31.320 --> 00:45:35.320]   I'm just, well, I'm just glad that there are all kinds of different people pursuing all
[00:45:35.320 --> 00:45:36.720]   kinds of different solutions.
[00:45:36.720 --> 00:45:40.840]   And like the people that might be saying that, well, with the people need, you could say
[00:45:40.840 --> 00:45:45.200]   not only do certain areas need malaria vaccines, they also need roads.
[00:45:45.200 --> 00:45:46.200]   They also need clean water.
[00:45:46.200 --> 00:45:47.440]   We need a lot of stuff.
[00:45:47.440 --> 00:45:49.480]   There's not a zero sum game.
[00:45:49.480 --> 00:45:51.640]   But that's what I'm saying.
[00:45:51.640 --> 00:46:00.160]   I mean, I'm glad that there are also people who, imagine helping lower income families
[00:46:00.160 --> 00:46:07.120]   and saying that, well, we're not going to make it possible for you to ever, we're not
[00:46:07.120 --> 00:46:08.640]   going to make it possible for you to take.
[00:46:08.640 --> 00:46:12.560]   If you're taking time to take your kids to see a movie or even to see like a free program
[00:46:12.560 --> 00:46:16.320]   at the library, that's time you could be spending making money to help feed your children.
[00:46:16.320 --> 00:46:17.880]   So we're not going to let you do that.
[00:46:17.880 --> 00:46:22.040]   There's so much that goes into creating a good, healthy life.
[00:46:22.040 --> 00:46:23.840]   And connectivity is one of those things.
[00:46:23.840 --> 00:46:29.320]   I would be disappointed if there was X dollars total worth of time, money and attention that
[00:46:29.320 --> 00:46:31.080]   people could give to helping other people.
[00:46:31.080 --> 00:46:36.100]   And they only put it into Facebook or into online services.
[00:46:36.100 --> 00:46:38.960]   But I would also, that's never the situation.
[00:46:38.960 --> 00:46:43.360]   There's going to be, there's going to be individual A who wants to put 100% of their
[00:46:43.360 --> 00:46:48.440]   attention into solving one part one problem, individual B who'll be someplace else, individual
[00:46:48.440 --> 00:46:50.360]   C who'll do someplace else.
[00:46:50.360 --> 00:46:55.360]   Once everybody does one thing that they're passionate about to solve one specific problem,
[00:46:55.360 --> 00:46:57.560]   that's how the whole picture gets clearer.
[00:46:57.560 --> 00:47:01.640]   And I'm going to, this by the way, I recommend you read the article in time, it's online,
[00:47:01.640 --> 00:47:03.680]   it's free, no paywall.
[00:47:03.680 --> 00:47:07.480]   But here's the quote you don't see in all the coverage of this article where the quote
[00:47:07.480 --> 00:47:09.920]   you see from Zuckerberg is ridiculous.
[00:47:09.920 --> 00:47:15.120]   Here's a good quote, a frustration mark says, a frustration I have is that a lot of people
[00:47:15.120 --> 00:47:20.440]   increasingly seem to equate an advertising business model with somehow being out of alignment
[00:47:20.440 --> 00:47:22.040]   with your customers.
[00:47:22.040 --> 00:47:25.000]   I think that's the most ridiculous concept.
[00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:30.080]   You think because you're paying Apple that you're somehow in alignment with Apple, if
[00:47:30.080 --> 00:47:35.000]   you were in alignment with them, they would make their products a lot cheaper.
[00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:36.400]   I think Mark is a smart guy.
[00:47:36.400 --> 00:47:37.960]   I think this is an interesting argument.
[00:47:37.960 --> 00:47:40.640]   I don't think either side is right, but I agree with you.
[00:47:40.640 --> 00:47:44.200]   This is a great thing to have the choice.
[00:47:44.200 --> 00:47:47.120]   And I think it's important to make the choice explicit and understand what's going on.
[00:47:47.120 --> 00:47:48.200]   This is a good article to read.
[00:47:48.200 --> 00:47:53.080]   It was in the December 15th time magazine and it is available online on their website.
[00:47:53.080 --> 00:47:55.560]   I mean, I don't like Facebook myself.
[00:47:55.560 --> 00:48:00.640]   I mean, I actively try not to use it as much as I can, but you cannot deny that for a lot
[00:48:00.640 --> 00:48:04.480]   of people, this is a great solution to a very important problem and it keeps a lot of families
[00:48:04.480 --> 00:48:08.280]   together that would not be communicating in any other way, shape or form.
[00:48:08.280 --> 00:48:09.280]   Hugely valuable.
[00:48:09.280 --> 00:48:10.280]   Hugely valuable.
[00:48:10.280 --> 00:48:14.100]   And the same way as Andy in that we still have accounts probably says just how deeply
[00:48:14.100 --> 00:48:16.280]   woven Facebook is into the fabric of the internet.
[00:48:16.280 --> 00:48:17.520]   I could get rid of my account.
[00:48:17.520 --> 00:48:19.360]   Nobody I really care about is on Facebook.
[00:48:19.360 --> 00:48:20.680]   None of my favorite numbers.
[00:48:20.680 --> 00:48:23.680]   It's fun.
[00:48:23.680 --> 00:48:25.760]   I was at Thanksgiving dinner with my extended family.
[00:48:25.760 --> 00:48:26.760]   And so, oh, wow.
[00:48:26.760 --> 00:48:32.240]   What do you think about your nephew's latest achievement?
[00:48:32.240 --> 00:48:34.080]   I'm like, what latest achievement?
[00:48:34.080 --> 00:48:39.560]   Oh, well, they graduate from high school three years early and got a Rhodes fellowship.
[00:48:39.560 --> 00:48:41.360]   I put it on Facebook three months.
[00:48:41.360 --> 00:48:42.360]   Oh, that's why.
[00:48:42.360 --> 00:48:43.360]   They can say that.
[00:48:43.360 --> 00:48:46.360]   But the problem with Facebook is there's no guarantee you saw that post even if you
[00:48:46.360 --> 00:48:50.200]   looked at Facebook assiduously because it doesn't show everything.
[00:48:50.200 --> 00:48:54.440]   I'm not a Facebook fan either, believe me.
[00:48:54.440 --> 00:48:58.440]   But as you said, so eloquently, Andy, so many people do get value out of it.
[00:48:58.440 --> 00:49:00.920]   I wouldn't ever say what you should.
[00:49:00.920 --> 00:49:04.080]   We had that same problem and Serenity did a video for us yesterday showing how to make
[00:49:04.080 --> 00:49:07.160]   a list and that way it avoid because Facebook will only show you certain items.
[00:49:07.160 --> 00:49:10.240]   But if you put them in a list, it turns out they'll show you everything from the people
[00:49:10.240 --> 00:49:12.160]   or pages that you put in there.
[00:49:12.160 --> 00:49:14.720]   You could also be really chronological if that care.
[00:49:14.720 --> 00:49:15.720]   But you'll see.
[00:49:15.720 --> 00:49:16.720]   Yeah.
[00:49:16.720 --> 00:49:18.120]   I mean, there's ways to get around it.
[00:49:18.120 --> 00:49:21.440]   But most people, I'm sure just do the algorithm, right?
[00:49:21.440 --> 00:49:24.000]   Yeah, we just let Facebook choose what you see.
[00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:29.120]   Tim Cook, an unrelated story, maybe times 2014 person of the year, at least he's on
[00:49:29.120 --> 00:49:31.160]   the short list.
[00:49:31.160 --> 00:49:35.240]   I think I'd put him on, especially after he came out.
[00:49:35.240 --> 00:49:38.720]   I think that might have put him over the top.
[00:49:38.720 --> 00:49:45.400]   Other choices, of course, you see there, Jack Ma, the CEO of Alibaba, Vladimir Putin,
[00:49:45.400 --> 00:49:48.200]   who is in charge of Russia.
[00:49:48.200 --> 00:49:50.200]   You're sure?
[00:49:50.200 --> 00:49:55.200]   Taylor Swift, who has very led lipstick.
[00:49:55.200 --> 00:49:58.600]   Ebola could be the person of the year.
[00:49:58.600 --> 00:50:03.400]   The Roger Goodell, the commissioner of the NFL, I think he's a long shot.
[00:50:03.400 --> 00:50:08.120]   I would say Tim Cook, if that's the competition, Tim Cook should be in there.
[00:50:08.120 --> 00:50:09.120]   First I hope.
[00:50:09.120 --> 00:50:10.120]   Yeah.
[00:50:10.120 --> 00:50:11.320]   The CEO of a Fortune 500.
[00:50:11.320 --> 00:50:14.120]   He has done so much for Apple.
[00:50:14.120 --> 00:50:18.920]   Apple's success as Tim Cook has been CEO is incredible, made it the most valuable company
[00:50:18.920 --> 00:50:19.920]   in the world.
[00:50:19.920 --> 00:50:23.040]   A lot to be said for that.
[00:50:23.040 --> 00:50:24.040]   Putin maybe.
[00:50:24.040 --> 00:50:25.040]   Yeah, maybe Putin.
[00:50:25.040 --> 00:50:28.280]   Remember, person of the year does not have to be a good person.
[00:50:28.280 --> 00:50:29.280]   It's just one influential.
[00:50:29.280 --> 00:50:30.280]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:50:30.280 --> 00:50:31.280]   It is.
[00:50:31.280 --> 00:50:32.280]   Exactly.
[00:50:32.280 --> 00:50:33.280]   Inflential, notable.
[00:50:33.280 --> 00:50:35.720]   The personal computer was a person of the year, one year.
[00:50:35.720 --> 00:50:38.520]   So, he was the person of the year in 2010.
[00:50:38.520 --> 00:50:39.520]   Yes.
[00:50:39.520 --> 00:50:46.320]   He's so far the only tech CEO to receive the awards in Spazos won it in 1999.
[00:50:46.320 --> 00:50:47.320]   Yeah.
[00:50:47.320 --> 00:50:51.520]   It's interesting that I don't know where this copy came from.
[00:50:51.520 --> 00:50:52.520]   It's on the time site.
[00:50:52.520 --> 00:50:57.160]   I don't know if it's the same people who were evaluating this or the same people who wrote
[00:50:57.160 --> 00:50:58.720]   this piece for time.
[00:50:58.720 --> 00:51:04.400]   But it's interesting that it's, first to openly gay Fortune 500 CEO was last after he
[00:51:04.400 --> 00:51:08.960]   introduced the six and the six plus and the Apple Watch and Apple Pay.
[00:51:08.960 --> 00:51:10.960]   Okay, let me.
[00:51:10.960 --> 00:51:15.280]   Yeah, that's the, this is the text and this is the list from time.
[00:51:15.280 --> 00:51:18.440]   Tim Cook, who introduced Apple's iPhone 6 and 6 plus Apple Watch and Apple Pay this
[00:51:18.440 --> 00:51:22.440]   year and whose decision to come out made him the first openly gay Fortune 500 CEO.
[00:51:22.440 --> 00:51:24.440]   You think that order is backwards?
[00:51:24.440 --> 00:51:25.440]   Yes.
[00:51:25.440 --> 00:51:30.240]   Well, definitely because he's a seller of really good gadgets, which is not a terrible
[00:51:30.240 --> 00:51:31.240]   thing to do.
[00:51:31.240 --> 00:51:37.480]   But when you talk about what makes someone notable, it's more than making a very important
[00:51:37.480 --> 00:51:38.480]   phone.
[00:51:38.480 --> 00:51:43.760]   It really is the idea that you have, I forget who, I think it was Chris, Chris, I think
[00:51:43.760 --> 00:51:45.080]   it was in Chris Rock's interview.
[00:51:45.080 --> 00:51:46.080]   Always had good.
[00:51:46.080 --> 00:51:47.080]   You've got to.
[00:51:47.080 --> 00:51:50.480]   That's, that's, that's, that's, that's, that actually made the perfect comment that it
[00:51:50.480 --> 00:51:57.640]   is really, it's, we, we kind of shrug when like a teenager or someone in their twenties
[00:51:57.640 --> 00:52:01.600]   is a celebrity or well known, like talk comes out as being gay because, well, you know,
[00:52:01.600 --> 00:52:02.800]   what's the big deal?
[00:52:02.800 --> 00:52:09.600]   But Tim Cook, somebody in his age group in the group of CEOs of super, super, super wealthy,
[00:52:09.600 --> 00:52:13.080]   super, super powerful people saying that I am not in the entertainment industry.
[00:52:13.080 --> 00:52:15.360]   I'm a corporate Titan and I am gay.
[00:52:15.360 --> 00:52:17.320]   Go ahead.
[00:52:17.320 --> 00:52:20.360]   Go ahead and make any complaints, have any backlash what you want.
[00:52:20.360 --> 00:52:24.840]   When his peer group has to, has to deal with an openly gay person, that's an incredibly
[00:52:24.840 --> 00:52:26.000]   important thing.
[00:52:26.000 --> 00:52:30.160]   That's not, and that's really something that even I hadn't considered when he, when he
[00:52:30.160 --> 00:52:31.320]   came out.
[00:52:31.320 --> 00:52:33.480]   So I think that that's the significant thing.
[00:52:33.480 --> 00:52:37.560]   It would be, I'm sorry, I did, I spoke backwards a minute ago.
[00:52:37.560 --> 00:52:44.800]   I meant that it will be interesting if he is chosen how they, how they intend to write
[00:52:44.800 --> 00:52:50.120]   about his selection about whether they say they talk about his success as the CEO of
[00:52:50.120 --> 00:53:00.400]   a very important tech company or where they talk about his leadership as a person of power
[00:53:00.400 --> 00:53:05.840]   able to do a great amount of good with that amount of power that he wields that goes beyond
[00:53:05.840 --> 00:53:11.680]   selling more gadgets, going beyond even coming out as a gay person, as a gay man.
[00:53:11.680 --> 00:53:17.840]   Also saying if he responsibility that he has, whatever he, whatever he has personally, for
[00:53:17.840 --> 00:53:23.920]   Apple being a little bit more open about charitable causes, being a little bit more, being a little
[00:53:23.920 --> 00:53:30.560]   bit more aggressive about matching donations of his employees and trying to make sure that
[00:53:30.560 --> 00:53:36.520]   Apple is a company that does things that its customers would definitely approve of.
[00:53:36.520 --> 00:53:40.160]   Because yeah, I mean, just like pretty much everybody is listening to this.
[00:53:40.160 --> 00:53:42.120]   I'm an Amazon customer.
[00:53:42.120 --> 00:53:43.120]   They have great deals.
[00:53:43.120 --> 00:53:44.960]   It's really, really convenient.
[00:53:44.960 --> 00:53:48.840]   There are things that I don't even consider buying at a store because it's just so much
[00:53:48.840 --> 00:53:54.520]   easier to buy this cable at Amazon and get it for $4 and arrives in two days instead
[00:53:54.520 --> 00:53:57.160]   of driving to Radio Shack on a day like this.
[00:53:57.160 --> 00:54:01.720]   It bothers me that they don't pay their warehouse employees enough and it bothers me
[00:54:01.720 --> 00:54:04.640]   that they treat their warehouse employees shabbily.
[00:54:04.640 --> 00:54:09.160]   And it pleases me when I hear good positive stories about how Apple treats its staff,
[00:54:09.160 --> 00:54:14.480]   about how safe all of its employees feel and how proud they feel about the environment
[00:54:14.480 --> 00:54:15.880]   that they work in.
[00:54:15.880 --> 00:54:20.880]   And so I would hope that if Apple does choose Tim Cook as a person of the year, they're
[00:54:20.880 --> 00:54:25.160]   not going to say, "Look, all the money he has made for Apple."
[00:54:25.160 --> 00:54:31.160]   And they put the focus more on the reasons why 100 years from now, you are still sort
[00:54:31.160 --> 00:54:33.720]   of pleased to read about this character.
[00:54:33.720 --> 00:54:34.720]   We don't say that.
[00:54:34.720 --> 00:54:38.480]   Yeah, he built some libraries because he felt really guilty about all the children that
[00:54:38.480 --> 00:54:43.560]   he killed in his factories by not caring about anything but production and pricing.
[00:54:43.560 --> 00:54:48.360]   I'm sorry, referring to the steel barons of 100 years ago, not referring to Apple, of
[00:54:48.360 --> 00:54:49.360]   course.
[00:54:49.360 --> 00:54:54.400]   Hal in our Charum says, "The only solution to this, Tim Cook and Vladimir Putin enter
[00:54:54.400 --> 00:54:55.400]   the octagon."
[00:54:55.400 --> 00:54:59.080]   A little wrestling.
[00:54:59.080 --> 00:55:00.080]   Go Auburn.
[00:55:00.080 --> 00:55:01.080]   There.
[00:55:01.080 --> 00:55:05.840]   I bet the Tim Cook looks better with his shirt off and I respect the fact that we have to
[00:55:05.840 --> 00:55:08.880]   guess how good he looks with his shirt off.
[00:55:08.880 --> 00:55:11.640]   There's a new UFC channel on the Apple TV as of today.
[00:55:11.640 --> 00:55:12.640]   Oh yeah.
[00:55:12.640 --> 00:55:13.960]   I'm not saying that's because of this.
[00:55:13.960 --> 00:55:17.600]   Yeah, the octagon.
[00:55:17.600 --> 00:55:20.000]   By the way, we'll find out tomorrow.
[00:55:20.000 --> 00:55:23.040]   Wednesday is when time will announce the person of the years.
[00:55:23.040 --> 00:55:32.240]   So you'll hear it first on Tech News today, 10 AM Pacific 1 PM Eastern, 1900 UTC on Twitter.tv.
[00:55:32.240 --> 00:55:34.800]   They already have made the People's Choice.
[00:55:34.800 --> 00:55:41.000]   Interestingly, Norenda Modi, the Prime Minister of India, was a fairly controversial figure
[00:55:41.000 --> 00:55:45.560]   before he was elected one as People's Choice.
[00:55:45.560 --> 00:55:49.480]   Find out tomorrow and we'll announce the people's team.
[00:55:49.480 --> 00:55:50.960]   He has a lot of people's.
[00:55:50.960 --> 00:55:54.880]   See, that's like when one of those symphony orchestra votes themselves a Grammy award.
[00:55:54.880 --> 00:55:58.480]   You know, if you're the head of the largest popular one, the largest popular country,
[00:55:58.480 --> 00:56:00.000]   you know, that's almost a gimme.
[00:56:00.000 --> 00:56:01.000]   Yeah.
[00:56:01.000 --> 00:56:03.960]   I think when the Blackberry Storm won Blackberry's Best Innovation Award.
[00:56:03.960 --> 00:56:04.960]   Yeah.
[00:56:04.960 --> 00:56:06.320]   Gonna take a break, come back.
[00:56:06.320 --> 00:56:07.640]   Lots more to talk about.
[00:56:07.640 --> 00:56:08.640]   Great cast.
[00:56:08.640 --> 00:56:11.000]   Always, it's the, it's the regulars, the core group.
[00:56:11.000 --> 00:56:14.480]   I guess Alex was, Lindsey was traveling today, but we've certainly got Renee Richie from
[00:56:14.480 --> 00:56:17.720]   iMore.com in Snowbound, Quebec.
[00:56:17.720 --> 00:56:19.680]   I haven't my great thing, Leo.
[00:56:19.680 --> 00:56:22.440]   I haven't mounted it yet, but I can, I can simulate Alex next time.
[00:56:22.440 --> 00:56:23.880]   Let's see what that looks like.
[00:56:23.880 --> 00:56:25.760]   Just simulate that behind you.
[00:56:25.760 --> 00:56:29.280]   I don't want to knock all that beautiful stuff you've put up behind you there.
[00:56:29.280 --> 00:56:30.280]   I don't know.
[00:56:30.280 --> 00:56:32.480]   We were just thinking, it's better on the sink.
[00:56:32.480 --> 00:56:34.680]   I know.
[00:56:34.680 --> 00:56:36.160]   The little Renee Richie.
[00:56:36.160 --> 00:56:39.800]   It's better on the single to have your backdrop.
[00:56:39.800 --> 00:56:42.200]   But then on the three shot, the gray is better.
[00:56:42.200 --> 00:56:47.640]   I have to say, I have to say, I bought actually like a, one of those, like one of those backdrop
[00:56:47.640 --> 00:56:52.120]   rigs that's actually 10 feet wide, I'm going to buy like a large, really large white backdrop,
[00:56:52.120 --> 00:56:55.840]   because when you have a small thing that you'd be right behind, Renee, you kind of look
[00:56:55.840 --> 00:56:57.520]   like a talking passport photo.
[00:56:57.520 --> 00:56:59.560]   That's all I'm saying.
[00:56:59.560 --> 00:57:02.360]   That might not be the effect we're looking for.
[00:57:02.360 --> 00:57:03.360]   I can't smile.
[00:57:03.360 --> 00:57:06.600]   I showed they brought to you by the folks.
[00:57:06.600 --> 00:57:07.920]   It's going and Andy not goes here.
[00:57:07.920 --> 00:57:08.920]   I didn't say hi, Andy.
[00:57:08.920 --> 00:57:14.000]   I have the not because you're from Chicago sometimes and his squirrel and his cows staring
[00:57:14.000 --> 00:57:16.480]   at the amazing phallic washing monument.
[00:57:16.480 --> 00:57:17.480]   That would be.
[00:57:17.480 --> 00:57:18.480]   Oh, you went there.
[00:57:18.480 --> 00:57:19.480]   I had to.
[00:57:19.480 --> 00:57:20.480]   I had to.
[00:57:20.480 --> 00:57:21.480]   I had to.
[00:57:21.480 --> 00:57:22.480]   Look at it.
[00:57:22.480 --> 00:57:24.480]   Why don't you click the cows?
[00:57:24.480 --> 00:57:26.120]   They seem impressed.
[00:57:26.120 --> 00:57:27.120]   They're impressed.
[00:57:27.120 --> 00:57:31.520]   Oh, it's a, they, they, we don't know what they're thinking.
[00:57:31.520 --> 00:57:35.000]   I know what they're, I'm the one who's like showing them around.
[00:57:35.000 --> 00:57:37.640]   I'm the bull vine facilitator during their travels.
[00:57:37.640 --> 00:57:38.640]   They share their confidence.
[00:57:38.640 --> 00:57:42.680]   You see that saying you see that bull over there.

[01:00:07.280 --> 01:00:11.440]   If you're a photographer, it lets you show, oh, they have an iPhone version too, lets you
[01:00:11.440 --> 01:00:15.640]   show your photos to a prospective client and it pulls it right from the site, but it doesn't
[01:00:15.640 --> 01:00:18.320]   give you the site template, it gives you a unique portfolio template.
[01:00:18.320 --> 01:00:19.520]   So cool.

[01:00:31.360 --> 01:00:33.080]   Thank you to Jason Howell.
[01:00:33.080 --> 01:00:35.440]   Hold down the fort while I was gone last week.
[01:00:35.440 --> 01:00:36.440]   Anytime Leo.
[01:00:36.440 --> 01:00:38.320]   Nice job.
[01:00:38.320 --> 01:00:40.200]   You don't take much time off during the week.
[01:00:40.200 --> 01:00:42.200]   It's the first time I have really done the show.
[01:00:42.200 --> 01:00:44.760]   By being sick in years.
[01:00:44.760 --> 01:00:47.920]   I didn't, in six years of tech TV, I never missed a single show.
[01:00:47.920 --> 01:00:50.600]   Food poisoning is horrible because you feel like you want to die, but only for a few
[01:00:50.600 --> 01:00:51.600]   hours.
[01:00:51.600 --> 01:00:53.840]   Well, don't get Sam and Ella last a week.
[01:00:53.840 --> 01:00:54.840]   Yeah.
[01:00:54.840 --> 01:00:57.400]   It's not a good one.
[01:00:57.400 --> 01:01:01.360]   But you know, it opens up the slosest of both ends.
[01:01:01.360 --> 01:01:02.360]   Yeah, bros.
[01:01:02.360 --> 01:01:04.640]   Actually, it didn't.
[01:01:04.640 --> 01:01:09.920]   Mostly, it was just really severe cramping and it was really uncomfortable.
[01:01:09.920 --> 01:01:15.280]   You know, I suspect the hotel we stayed at on Thanksgiving night because the next morning
[01:01:15.280 --> 01:01:21.320]   we had breakfast there and the server told us the eggs were unusual.
[01:01:21.320 --> 01:01:23.080]   And I said, are these fresh?
[01:01:23.080 --> 01:01:25.680]   She says, no, they come in a big plastic bag.
[01:01:25.680 --> 01:01:33.120]   She say, we go through my body weight and scrambled eggs every breakfast.
[01:01:33.120 --> 01:01:36.280]   That's what I think looking back in hindsight.
[01:01:36.280 --> 01:01:38.920]   I've been hit twice on airport food.
[01:01:38.920 --> 01:01:43.800]   I've even fruited an airport and then I've landed like at CES or at WWDC and just been
[01:01:43.800 --> 01:01:44.880]   unusable for a couple days.
[01:01:44.880 --> 01:01:52.400]   I just, I really feel like, I eat out too much now, you know, and I should start, I'm
[01:01:52.400 --> 01:01:55.160]   going to get, I'm getting back to cooking in the house because I know how to wash my
[01:01:55.160 --> 01:01:59.800]   hands and avoid cross contamination, wash the knives, wash the cutting boards, all that.
[01:01:59.800 --> 01:02:01.880]   Look at the egg before you cook it.
[01:02:01.880 --> 01:02:02.880]   Yeah.
[01:02:02.880 --> 01:02:04.040]   Anyway, I'm sorry.
[01:02:04.040 --> 01:02:05.040]   That's disgusting.
[01:02:05.040 --> 01:02:06.040]   Nobody should hear about that.
[01:02:06.040 --> 01:02:11.200]   I mean, I oven to Apple, you have a hole in music right now.
[01:02:11.200 --> 01:02:13.840]   Let me plug it.
[01:02:13.840 --> 01:02:15.360]   Is that the first time Jimmy's used that line?
[01:02:15.360 --> 01:02:16.360]   I don't know.
[01:02:16.360 --> 01:02:18.240]   I'll go on five.
[01:02:18.240 --> 01:02:21.800]   That's a lyric in some songs somewhere.
[01:02:21.800 --> 01:02:22.800]   Yeah.
[01:02:22.800 --> 01:02:26.120]   He's talking about the lack of presence in streaming music.
[01:02:26.120 --> 01:02:32.840]   There's there's Jimmy on the left next to Tim Cook, Dr. Dre and Eddie Q, the famous picture.
[01:02:32.840 --> 01:02:38.720]   The last time either Jimmy or Dre were seen at the Apple campus, I convinced them says
[01:02:38.720 --> 01:02:43.520]   Jimmy that they, this Jimmy, I have been, of course, the head of beats, but also a legend
[01:02:43.520 --> 01:02:47.600]   in the music industry, legendary producer and executive.
[01:02:47.600 --> 01:02:48.600]   I convinced them.
[01:02:48.600 --> 01:02:51.480]   I don't know how Jimmy talks, but I imagine it's something like this.
[01:02:51.480 --> 01:02:53.360]   I convinced them they had a bodice company.
[01:02:53.360 --> 01:02:56.560]   I said, I don't want to work for anybody else.
[01:02:56.560 --> 01:02:58.440]   I want to do this at Apple.
[01:02:58.440 --> 01:03:00.440]   I know I can achieve this at Apple.
[01:03:00.440 --> 01:03:01.440]   I don't want to.
[01:03:01.440 --> 01:03:02.440]   I want to have a little higher voice.
[01:03:02.440 --> 01:03:03.600]   I don't want to shop it.
[01:03:03.600 --> 01:03:06.000]   I want to come here to Steve's company.
[01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:09.080]   Did nobody tell Jimmy Steve's gone?
[01:03:09.080 --> 01:03:10.080]   I know you guys.
[01:03:10.080 --> 01:03:12.080]   I know what you're capable of.
[01:03:12.080 --> 01:03:14.480]   I know you get popular culture.
[01:03:14.480 --> 01:03:17.400]   I know you have a whole in music right now.
[01:03:17.400 --> 01:03:19.920]   Let me plug it.
[01:03:19.920 --> 01:03:24.240]   I think it was two years before they said, yeah.
[01:03:24.240 --> 01:03:28.240]   So basically what Apple's looking for in a resume is I was once one of the dead end
[01:03:28.240 --> 01:03:32.280]   kids.
[01:03:32.280 --> 01:03:34.840]   I'm Leo Gossie.
[01:03:34.840 --> 01:03:41.640]   Apparently, I have been pitched a subscription music service to Apple in 2003, the earliest
[01:03:41.640 --> 01:03:45.960]   years of the iPod long before Pandora and Spotify.
[01:03:45.960 --> 01:03:47.440]   Iovine does not have a specific.
[01:03:47.440 --> 01:03:55.640]   This is from an article at Mac Rumors, Julie Clover writing.
[01:03:55.640 --> 01:04:01.520]   But I think the interview comes from GQ's magazine where he was named Man of the, one
[01:04:01.520 --> 01:04:04.640]   of the men of the year.
[01:04:04.640 --> 01:04:10.600]   So he's revealed some of the secrets.
[01:04:10.600 --> 01:04:13.680]   Apparently a longtime friend of Steve Jobs, they had a close relationship.
[01:04:13.680 --> 01:04:17.320]   He collaborated with Steve on a number of things, including, as we I think knew, the U2 special
[01:04:17.320 --> 01:04:19.920]   iPod.
[01:04:19.920 --> 01:04:25.120]   He does not have a specific title at Apple, a senior role at the company alongside Dr.
[01:04:25.120 --> 01:04:27.840]   Dre under Eddie Q.
[01:04:27.840 --> 01:04:33.760]   Do anything more to be said about beats?
[01:04:33.760 --> 01:04:38.040]   Until Apple says something about it.
[01:04:38.040 --> 01:04:40.040]   Yeah.
[01:04:40.040 --> 01:04:42.840]   Here's a picture.
[01:04:42.840 --> 01:04:47.720]   It does seem like one of those long haul sort of things where, I mean, I would not have
[01:04:47.720 --> 01:04:51.520]   been surprised if Apple had, excuse me, surprised me that Apple didn't have any announcements
[01:04:51.520 --> 01:04:53.840]   of any kind by the end of this year.
[01:04:53.840 --> 01:04:57.600]   But that simply means that this is a much bigger plan than just simply we want.
[01:04:57.600 --> 01:04:59.240]   We have a, they have a product that we want.
[01:04:59.240 --> 01:05:01.960]   We want to put our sticker on it and put it out there.
[01:05:01.960 --> 01:05:06.520]   It's like, no, it's, it's like they bought a, they were, they're at a spice market and
[01:05:06.520 --> 01:05:09.080]   bought this really cool, seeming spice.
[01:05:09.080 --> 01:05:12.880]   And they don't know how they're going to use it in their next dish, but they know that
[01:05:12.880 --> 01:05:15.080]   their next dish is going to involve the spice somehow.
[01:05:15.080 --> 01:05:23.600]   In a singularly clueless headline in GQ magazine, they write, Jimmy Iovine, the music
[01:05:23.600 --> 01:05:26.280]   legend who just might save Apple.
[01:05:26.280 --> 01:05:27.280]   What?
[01:05:27.280 --> 01:05:29.360]   He'll save them from the money.
[01:05:29.360 --> 01:05:30.360]   He's going to stop them.
[01:05:30.360 --> 01:05:31.360]   He's calling on top of them.
[01:05:31.360 --> 01:05:33.520]   Might be the other way around.
[01:05:33.520 --> 01:05:34.520]   Yeah.
[01:05:34.520 --> 01:05:37.640]   The same thing is that Apple didn't announce almost anything to do with iTunes either
[01:05:37.640 --> 01:05:40.520]   at WWDC or during the fall events.
[01:05:40.520 --> 01:05:43.080]   We didn't hear continuity for iTunes yet.
[01:05:43.080 --> 01:05:44.560]   You got to figure that's got to be common.
[01:05:44.560 --> 01:05:46.040]   There's the Apple TV stuff.
[01:05:46.040 --> 01:05:49.000]   There's a whole bunch of stuff going on there that do it to Andy's point.
[01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:50.240]   It's not a relabel.
[01:05:50.240 --> 01:05:53.360]   It's a rethinking of how they deliver a better unified service, I think.
[01:05:53.360 --> 01:05:54.360]   Yeah.
[01:05:54.360 --> 01:05:59.680]   Also, it's interesting that this is another piece that doesn't really talk about the
[01:05:59.680 --> 01:06:05.200]   Dre's contributions, which I don't know why that is.
[01:06:05.200 --> 01:06:07.200]   I forgot about Dre's in the studio.
[01:06:07.200 --> 01:06:08.200]   Come on.
[01:06:08.200 --> 01:06:10.200]   Well, do we know about Dre?
[01:06:10.200 --> 01:06:14.160]   I mean, the thing is, if this were the sort of thing where they had a headphone company,
[01:06:14.160 --> 01:06:16.000]   they just wanted a name to put on it.
[01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:17.000]   He would have been out of that.
[01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:19.320]   He would have been in and out of that company really, really, excuse me.
[01:06:19.320 --> 01:06:23.120]   He might be still in the company if it was really profitable, but would he still be
[01:06:23.120 --> 01:06:27.720]   talked about as here's a member of the executive team as opposed to someone who's lending a
[01:06:27.720 --> 01:06:28.720]   name to a product?
[01:06:28.720 --> 01:06:29.720]   Is Apple saying that?
[01:06:29.720 --> 01:06:30.720]   Is Apple saying?
[01:06:30.720 --> 01:06:31.720]   Well, they changed the marketing.
[01:06:31.720 --> 01:06:33.080]   It used to say Beats by Dre.
[01:06:33.080 --> 01:06:35.040]   And now on Apple side, it says Beats by Dr. Dre.
[01:06:35.040 --> 01:06:37.640]   So they're paying attention enough at least to change the product.
[01:06:37.640 --> 01:06:40.440]   Well, that's a terrible improvement.
[01:06:40.440 --> 01:06:42.480]   It's Beats by Dre, Beats by Dr. Dre.
[01:06:42.480 --> 01:06:43.480]   To be fair, he did not.
[01:06:43.480 --> 01:06:44.480]   He did not.
[01:06:44.480 --> 01:06:45.480]   He did not.
[01:06:45.480 --> 01:06:46.480]   He did not.
[01:06:46.480 --> 01:06:48.160]   He was going to doctor school to be called Mr. Lee.
[01:06:48.160 --> 01:06:50.040]   He had not defended his thesis yet.
[01:06:50.040 --> 01:06:53.320]   He was only a doctoral candidate, but at that time.
[01:06:53.320 --> 01:06:54.320]   Wait a minute.
[01:06:54.320 --> 01:06:57.520]   They changed the name from Beats by Dre to Beats by Dr. Dre.
[01:06:57.520 --> 01:06:59.680]   They have Trent Reznor.
[01:06:59.680 --> 01:07:02.760]   I think they reaffirmed his involvement with the Apple projects.
[01:07:02.760 --> 01:07:07.600]   That is of interest because Trent, of course, of Nine Inch Nails has said already that he's
[01:07:07.600 --> 01:07:08.600]   very involved.
[01:07:08.600 --> 01:07:09.600]   And that makes sense.
[01:07:09.600 --> 01:07:15.560]   And boy, Trent is digitally literate and certainly creative and talented.
[01:07:15.560 --> 01:07:19.480]   Dre, the first thing Dre said is, yeah, I'm going back in the studio.
[01:07:19.480 --> 01:07:20.480]   He's making records.
[01:07:20.480 --> 01:07:25.600]   Yeah, but it just seems puzzling that they would go so far as to say hi.
[01:07:25.600 --> 01:07:28.080]   And let's have him in the group picture.
[01:07:28.080 --> 01:07:32.720]   Let's mention him as a part of the executive team as opposed to just somebody who is going
[01:07:32.720 --> 01:07:36.080]   to have a parking pass for the lot.
[01:07:36.080 --> 01:07:40.760]   So I just worry that since there's so much information available of what I've been has
[01:07:40.760 --> 01:07:46.680]   done and it's so obvious given his business work, what his relationship with him, I worry
[01:07:46.680 --> 01:07:49.000]   that I'm giving short shift to Dre.
[01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:53.000]   So I simply know nothing about him beyond the fact that he's beyond his music.
[01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:54.000]   Here's what I think.
[01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:55.600]   I think I think Iovine was streaming.
[01:07:55.600 --> 01:07:58.440]   Dre was hard where it was the headphones.
[01:07:58.440 --> 01:08:01.280]   And Apple doesn't really care about the hardware.
[01:08:01.280 --> 01:08:04.960]   It's the streaming music that's really important to Apple, right?
[01:08:04.960 --> 01:08:07.640]   I just think it's really hard to get office space in the iTunes complex.
[01:08:07.640 --> 01:08:11.280]   Well, they both have offices, don't they?
[01:08:11.280 --> 01:08:13.400]   By the way, I think I got the name right.
[01:08:13.400 --> 01:08:19.680]   Jimmy Iovine's a group, Jim Iovine, group in Brooklyn, his nickname was Moochie.
[01:08:19.680 --> 01:08:21.240]   So I think he did talk like that.
[01:08:21.240 --> 01:08:22.880]   He was one of the dead end.
[01:08:22.880 --> 01:08:23.880]   Moochie.
[01:08:23.880 --> 01:08:25.440]   Yeah, what do you want?
[01:08:25.440 --> 01:08:26.520]   Hey, Moochie.
[01:08:26.520 --> 01:08:31.040]   Now we were, by the way, and I haven't mentioned this on the air, but if you watched Sunday
[01:08:31.040 --> 01:08:38.120]   night, if you watched newsroom on HBO, you would have seen very briefly one of the producers
[01:08:38.120 --> 01:08:40.840]   in newsroom wearing Beats headphones.
[01:08:40.840 --> 01:08:41.840]   And reading to read.
[01:08:41.840 --> 01:08:42.840]   Oh, yeah.
[01:08:42.840 --> 01:08:44.840]   I buried the lead.
[01:08:44.840 --> 01:08:48.000]   Plus you, plus you for pointing that out, Renee.
[01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:51.640]   Then that fact, it totally been lost.
[01:08:51.640 --> 01:08:54.720]   Yeah, that's, that's pretty cool.
[01:08:54.720 --> 01:08:58.400]   He was watching Twit while he was, I think he's a bad guy.
[01:08:58.400 --> 01:09:00.400]   He's watching Twit.
[01:09:00.400 --> 01:09:01.400]   Are there bad guys in news?
[01:09:01.400 --> 01:09:03.800]   Well, he was being a bad guy and wearing Beats headphones.
[01:09:03.800 --> 01:09:05.360]   So Beats is still getting out there.
[01:09:05.360 --> 01:09:07.160]   I see Beats in movies.
[01:09:07.160 --> 01:09:09.960]   Well, there are donuts healthy.
[01:09:09.960 --> 01:09:12.360]   Commercial was really good.
[01:09:12.360 --> 01:09:13.840]   The donut selfie commercial.
[01:09:13.840 --> 01:09:14.840]   I missed that one.
[01:09:14.840 --> 01:09:16.040]   It was the new Beats commercial.
[01:09:16.040 --> 01:09:19.280]   The donut selfie was this woman, I forget her name now, she did a video where she showed
[01:09:19.280 --> 01:09:23.080]   you how to take your iPhone from one ear, bring it around to the other ear and use the
[01:09:23.080 --> 01:09:25.520]   darkness as a transition to take video selfies of yourself.
[01:09:25.520 --> 01:09:27.080]   Oh, I did see that one.
[01:09:27.080 --> 01:09:28.080]   Yeah.
[01:09:28.080 --> 01:09:30.400]   So they did a version of that for Beats with a bunch of different celebrities and the woman
[01:09:30.400 --> 01:09:32.160]   who originally created the donut selfie in it.
[01:09:32.160 --> 01:09:34.800]   And it was a really good, I think it was most recent Beats ad.
[01:09:34.800 --> 01:09:37.480]   Yeah, they have a whole, whole tumbler.
[01:09:37.480 --> 01:09:41.320]   Don't get, don't, don't, dedicated to the donut selfie.
[01:09:41.320 --> 01:09:42.320]   I did see that.
[01:09:42.320 --> 01:09:43.320]   Now I know what you're talking about.
[01:09:43.320 --> 01:09:45.480]   I was thinking, you see, you said the word donut.
[01:09:45.480 --> 01:09:46.480]   Yeah.
[01:09:46.480 --> 01:09:48.480]   And my mind went to sprinkles.
[01:09:48.480 --> 01:09:51.200]   As well as should.
[01:09:51.200 --> 01:09:53.280]   But you're talking about the idea of taking the selfie around.
[01:09:53.280 --> 01:09:54.280]   Is it a video?
[01:09:54.280 --> 01:09:55.280]   Yeah.
[01:09:55.280 --> 01:09:56.280]   It's like a video.
[01:09:56.280 --> 01:09:58.560]   So it's really cool.
[01:09:58.560 --> 01:10:00.880]   You can go to donutselfie.com to learn how to do it.
[01:10:00.880 --> 01:10:01.880]   Yeah.
[01:10:01.880 --> 01:10:02.880]   Yeah, can.
[01:10:02.880 --> 01:10:03.880]   This is donut.
[01:10:03.880 --> 01:10:04.880]   I'm here.
[01:10:04.880 --> 01:10:08.160]   I'm on the tutorial right now.
[01:10:08.160 --> 01:10:10.800]   This is brilliant marketing, at least in this company, right?
[01:10:10.800 --> 01:10:12.240]   They know what they're doing.
[01:10:12.240 --> 01:10:13.240]   Here, let's listen in.
[01:10:13.240 --> 01:10:14.240]   I'm getting more video.
[01:10:14.240 --> 01:10:22.240]   I'm getting more audio than let me.
[01:10:22.240 --> 01:10:25.240]   I think if you go to donuts, I'll be not.
[01:10:25.240 --> 01:10:26.240]   I see.
[01:10:26.240 --> 01:10:31.680]   The donut selfie ad so that we can, who is this giving us the tutorial here?
[01:10:31.680 --> 01:10:36.000]   We must have redone this because the original woman who created it has her own set of tutorials.
[01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:38.000]   This is Keenan Thompson.
[01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:41.240]   I thought it was, I thought Drey had gained some weight, but no, it's Keenan Thompson
[01:10:41.240 --> 01:10:42.240]   here.
[01:10:42.240 --> 01:10:43.240]   What's up, is your boy, Pimptastic.
[01:10:43.240 --> 01:10:46.200]   I'm about to teach you how to do the solo selfie.
[01:10:46.200 --> 01:10:47.840]   First you want to tell your camera on?
[01:10:47.840 --> 01:10:48.840]   Okay, good start.
[01:10:48.840 --> 01:10:49.840]   Make sure it's on big Joe.
[01:10:49.840 --> 01:10:50.840]   Wait a minute.
[01:10:50.840 --> 01:10:51.840]   Say that again.
[01:10:51.840 --> 01:10:52.840]   Bijo.
[01:10:52.840 --> 01:10:53.840]   Vidjo.
[01:10:53.840 --> 01:10:54.840]   Oh, I get it.
[01:10:54.840 --> 01:10:55.840]   Bijo.
[01:10:55.840 --> 01:10:57.640]   He's, by the way, using a massive iPhone 6 Plus.
[01:10:57.640 --> 01:10:58.640]   That's cool.
[01:10:58.640 --> 01:11:00.840]   Then you want to face your screen outwards.
[01:11:00.840 --> 01:11:02.360]   Start at the beat.
[01:11:02.360 --> 01:11:03.360]   Bring it around.
[01:11:03.360 --> 01:11:05.040]   Hit that selfie pose.
[01:11:05.040 --> 01:11:06.040]   Pimp it.
[01:11:06.040 --> 01:11:08.440]   Bring it around to the other beat.
[01:11:08.440 --> 01:11:09.480]   It's just that simple.
[01:11:09.480 --> 01:11:12.880]   If you want to crank up the Pimp juice, do it in a slow mode.
[01:11:12.880 --> 01:11:13.880]   You dig.
[01:11:13.880 --> 01:11:15.720]   Crank up the Pimp juice.
[01:11:15.720 --> 01:11:17.800]   I think the original tutorials are better.
[01:11:17.800 --> 01:11:18.800]   With your donuts.
[01:11:18.800 --> 01:11:21.280]   That's selfie.
[01:11:21.280 --> 01:11:22.920]   And by the way, it's about beats, right?
[01:11:22.920 --> 01:11:27.240]   Because he says you start at the beat, you do the selfie, you get to the other beat.
[01:11:27.240 --> 01:11:30.720]   I hope she got well compensated for that because they just took over her entire meme.
[01:11:30.720 --> 01:11:33.120]   So this was, so this was not somebody who did it for beats.
[01:11:33.120 --> 01:11:37.320]   This was, this woman was doing it originally just for herself.
[01:11:37.320 --> 01:11:38.320]   Yeah.
[01:11:38.320 --> 01:11:40.320]   And beats sort of the business.
[01:11:40.320 --> 01:11:41.320]   Is she invented?
[01:11:41.320 --> 01:11:42.320]   Yeah.
[01:11:42.320 --> 01:11:43.320]   Well, you'll see her at the very end of this commercial.
[01:11:43.320 --> 01:11:46.600]   Oh, so she's not the model in the bikini top.
[01:11:46.600 --> 01:11:47.600]   She's young.
[01:11:47.600 --> 01:11:48.600]   I don't know if she's Chinese or not, but she's not.
[01:11:48.600 --> 01:11:51.960]   But these are real, these are real people famous people.
[01:11:51.960 --> 01:11:53.480]   Yeah, those are all celebrities.
[01:11:53.480 --> 01:11:55.080]   People that were way too old to know.
[01:11:55.080 --> 01:11:56.080]   Is that Ashton Kutcher?
[01:11:56.080 --> 01:11:57.080]   Oh, OK.
[01:11:57.080 --> 01:11:59.840]   I don't know.
[01:11:59.840 --> 01:12:00.840]   You recognize him?
[01:12:00.840 --> 01:12:01.840]   That's the woman.
[01:12:01.840 --> 01:12:02.840]   She invented it.
[01:12:02.840 --> 01:12:03.840]   Yeah.
[01:12:03.840 --> 01:12:04.840]   Yeah.
[01:12:04.840 --> 01:12:06.640]   I'm going to do more donuts selfies.
[01:12:06.640 --> 01:12:07.640]   You should leave.
[01:12:07.640 --> 01:12:08.880]   It was the phrase I want to bring it.
[01:12:08.880 --> 01:12:10.720]   I want to bring out the pimp.
[01:12:10.720 --> 01:12:12.720]   What was it?
[01:12:12.720 --> 01:12:14.320]   Dial up the pimping.
[01:12:14.320 --> 01:12:16.160]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:12:16.160 --> 01:12:17.240]   Show title.
[01:12:17.240 --> 01:12:20.720]   I'm dialing up the pimping now.
[01:12:20.720 --> 01:12:21.960]   The pimp juice.
[01:12:21.960 --> 01:12:22.880]   Dial up the pimp juice.
[01:12:22.880 --> 01:12:23.400]   Yeah.
[01:12:23.400 --> 01:12:24.320]   I think that's what it was.
[01:12:24.320 --> 01:12:26.080]   Yeah.
[01:12:26.080 --> 01:12:27.160]   Turn up the pimp juice.
[01:12:27.160 --> 01:12:31.720]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:12:31.720 --> 01:12:34.400]   Oh, but to do this, you have to have--
[01:12:34.400 --> 01:12:35.720]   oh, you know, they're selling the fact
[01:12:35.720 --> 01:12:38.160]   that they don't have wires anymore on the beach.
[01:12:38.160 --> 01:12:39.360]   But this is close to the equivalent
[01:12:39.360 --> 01:12:41.200]   to what the old RITunes ads were like, you know,
[01:12:41.200 --> 01:12:42.760]   sort of the pulse of the community.
[01:12:42.760 --> 01:12:43.760]   It is.
[01:12:43.760 --> 01:12:44.760]   It is.
[01:12:44.760 --> 01:12:45.760]   It is.
[01:12:45.760 --> 01:12:47.200]   And I think that that is something maybe Apple could
[01:12:47.200 --> 01:12:48.200]   use some help with.
[01:12:48.200 --> 01:12:49.200]   So that's good.
[01:12:49.200 --> 01:12:51.960]   [SIGHS]
[01:12:51.960 --> 01:12:55.520]   Moochi is in residence.
[01:12:55.520 --> 01:12:57.680]   Dr. Moochi.
[01:12:57.680 --> 01:12:58.760]   It was a good night.
[01:12:58.760 --> 01:13:00.440]   iPad Air commercial this weekend, too,
[01:13:00.440 --> 01:13:02.800]   during the football game.
[01:13:02.800 --> 01:13:04.120]   It's a Super Bowl.
[01:13:04.120 --> 01:13:05.120]   Yeah, I was going to say, great.
[01:13:05.120 --> 01:13:07.440]   The games are Super Bowls to me.
[01:13:07.440 --> 01:13:09.360]   The Grey Cup.
[01:13:09.360 --> 01:13:10.720]   The Grey Cup, the Earl Grey T.
[01:13:10.720 --> 01:13:11.920]   Should I play it?
[01:13:11.920 --> 01:13:14.240]   Is it iPad Air?
[01:13:14.240 --> 01:13:16.240]   Add.
[01:13:16.240 --> 01:13:18.280]   You can go to apple.com/outbuild.
[01:13:18.280 --> 01:13:20.760]   Is this one called Change?
[01:13:20.760 --> 01:13:22.600]   You don't know what the titles of the ads are.
[01:13:22.600 --> 01:13:23.840]   Changes in the air.
[01:13:23.840 --> 01:13:24.760]   Watch the film.
[01:13:24.760 --> 01:13:25.960]   No, no, no.
[01:13:25.960 --> 01:13:26.920]   Where's the ads?
[01:13:26.920 --> 01:13:29.800]   Apple.com/outube.com/apple.
[01:13:29.800 --> 01:13:31.760]   It'll be the first one.
[01:13:31.760 --> 01:13:33.320]   All right.
[01:13:33.320 --> 01:13:35.680]   Thank you for helping us find Apple ads.
[01:13:35.680 --> 01:13:36.480]   A little-- there it is.
[01:13:36.480 --> 01:13:42.400]   It is called Change.
[01:13:42.400 --> 01:13:44.960]   And this is the Orwell's singing.
[01:13:44.960 --> 01:13:47.960]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:13:47.960 --> 01:13:49.440]   Oh.
[01:13:49.440 --> 01:13:50.640]   Wait a minute.
[01:13:50.640 --> 01:13:54.600]   Is it a good idea to put an iPad Air in your gas tank?
[01:13:54.600 --> 01:13:55.520]   Oh, it's on top of it.
[01:13:55.520 --> 01:13:56.520]   OK.
[01:13:56.520 --> 01:13:57.720]   That'll work great as long as you only
[01:13:57.720 --> 01:13:59.200]   drive that motorcycle indoors.
[01:13:59.200 --> 01:14:01.920]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:14:01.920 --> 01:14:05.080]   Once you're in the sunlight, that's not a good choice.
[01:14:05.080 --> 01:14:07.080]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:14:07.080 --> 01:14:10.560]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:14:10.560 --> 01:14:11.160]   I do love it.
[01:14:11.160 --> 01:14:11.680]   I have to say.
[01:14:11.680 --> 01:14:12.280]   Also, I love the ads.
[01:14:12.280 --> 01:14:12.280]   I love the ads.
[01:14:12.280 --> 01:14:12.800]   I love the ads.
[01:14:12.800 --> 01:14:13.280]   I love the ads.
[01:14:13.280 --> 01:14:13.800]   I love the ads.
[01:14:13.800 --> 01:14:15.720]   Yeah, not recommended.
[01:14:15.720 --> 01:14:17.560]   It's thin enough.
[01:14:17.560 --> 01:14:19.640]   I was very pleased to say that at the Stevie Wonder
[01:14:19.640 --> 01:14:23.480]   concert, not one person took an iPad video.
[01:14:23.480 --> 01:14:24.800]   God bless them.
[01:14:24.800 --> 01:14:26.280]   So the word is getting out.
[01:14:26.280 --> 01:14:29.160]   There are about 8,000 people taking iPhone videos.
[01:14:29.160 --> 01:14:31.080]   And a little pro tip here.
[01:14:31.080 --> 01:14:33.160]   Turn off the flash on your camera phone
[01:14:33.160 --> 01:14:35.240]   when you're taking a picture of a stage 100 feet away.
[01:14:35.240 --> 01:14:36.720]   And all you're going to do is illuminate
[01:14:36.720 --> 01:14:38.600]   the hair of the people in front of you.
[01:14:38.600 --> 01:14:41.040]   And annoy everybody behind you.
[01:14:41.040 --> 01:14:44.320]   I was sitting behind a woman who did that at least 20 times.
[01:14:44.320 --> 01:14:46.080]   I almost tapped her in the show so you
[01:14:46.080 --> 01:14:47.040]   could turn the flash off.
[01:14:47.040 --> 01:14:48.160]   It's not going to do any good.
[01:14:48.160 --> 01:14:49.160]   Almost tapped her out.
[01:14:49.160 --> 01:14:51.200]   I couldn't believe she didn't even notice.
[01:14:51.200 --> 01:14:55.920]   And then there's another really bad trend in public.
[01:14:55.920 --> 01:15:00.600]   People are taking at concerts flash selfies.
[01:15:00.600 --> 01:15:04.520]   So the people in front of me are taking selfies.
[01:15:04.520 --> 01:15:06.840]   And the flash is hitting me in the eye.
[01:15:06.840 --> 01:15:09.280]   You missed out on the obvious solution
[01:15:09.280 --> 01:15:10.760]   to get them to make sure--
[01:15:10.760 --> 01:15:12.480]   get that lady behind you to make sure you turned off
[01:15:12.480 --> 01:15:14.600]   the flash so that you're completely in darkness.
[01:15:14.600 --> 01:15:16.760]   You could have just taken your hand like this
[01:15:16.760 --> 01:15:20.280]   and moved the finger and just felt it like that for 10 minutes.
[01:15:20.280 --> 01:15:22.880]   Unless you wanted that to be the fourth round of every picture.
[01:15:22.880 --> 01:15:25.280]   Then it will go viral Andy.
[01:15:25.280 --> 01:15:28.120]   I photo bombed a few of those selfies.
[01:15:28.120 --> 01:15:29.680]   Oh, that's even perfect.
[01:15:29.680 --> 01:15:31.720]   I would love her to put that file.
[01:15:31.720 --> 01:15:34.640]   See what that jerk did when I was just taking flash pictures
[01:15:34.640 --> 01:15:37.280]   at a concert with my phone all night?
[01:15:37.280 --> 01:15:41.160]   Boy, that guy was a jerk, wasn't he?
[01:15:41.160 --> 01:15:43.280]   But back to Beats, though.
[01:15:43.280 --> 01:15:45.800]   You reminded me of this really good article.
[01:15:45.800 --> 01:15:48.920]   The only involvement I have in football is the AV Club
[01:15:48.920 --> 01:15:52.040]   has a column called "Block and Tackle," written by John Tati.
[01:15:52.040 --> 01:15:54.120]   Hope I'm perhaps his last name right.
[01:15:54.120 --> 01:15:57.800]   That is just a really readable column on football.
[01:15:57.800 --> 01:16:01.760]   This week's column, he's talking about headphones
[01:16:01.760 --> 01:16:05.360]   and talks about the controversy because the NFL
[01:16:05.360 --> 01:16:08.920]   has a contract with Bose to be like the official headphones
[01:16:08.920 --> 01:16:13.080]   of the NFL and finding players for wearing any headphones
[01:16:13.080 --> 01:16:14.280]   that aren't Bose.
[01:16:14.280 --> 01:16:18.600]   But that had the effect of, oh, because we football players
[01:16:18.600 --> 01:16:23.880]   either are proud or because we want to market ourselves
[01:16:23.880 --> 01:16:27.120]   as like anti-authoritarian, we want to definitely now
[01:16:27.120 --> 01:16:30.000]   be wearing not Bose headphones and be seen not wearing
[01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:32.000]   not wearing Bose headphones.
[01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:35.520]   And he has a great quote from one of these players,
[01:16:35.520 --> 01:16:38.320]   the Denver Safety TJ Ward, saying that Bose headphones
[01:16:38.320 --> 01:16:41.360]   are quote, old people headphones, unquote,
[01:16:41.360 --> 01:16:44.080]   and beats are the ones that actually everybody wants--
[01:16:44.080 --> 01:16:46.080]   everybody wants to have beats.
[01:16:46.080 --> 01:16:47.320]   That's actually true.
[01:16:47.320 --> 01:16:49.240]   And the contract with the NFL requires
[01:16:49.240 --> 01:16:52.680]   that players not be seen on camera wearing beats
[01:16:52.680 --> 01:16:56.440]   or any other brand except Bose for 90 minutes before and after
[01:16:56.440 --> 01:16:59.120]   the game, of course, this is well within that time frame.
[01:16:59.120 --> 01:17:03.720]   This is my own esteemed quarterback Colin Kaepernick
[01:17:03.720 --> 01:17:06.400]   for the San Francisco 49ers, who to this day still
[01:17:06.400 --> 01:17:09.000]   at every press conference despite his pathetic performance
[01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:13.280]   on the field continues to violate the NFL's strictures
[01:17:13.280 --> 01:17:14.880]   and wear beats headphones.
[01:17:14.880 --> 01:17:17.400]   He's now covering up the Beats logo with a piece of tape.
[01:17:17.400 --> 01:17:18.520]   But look, Bose doesn't make--
[01:17:18.520 --> 01:17:19.040]   Because--
[01:17:19.040 --> 01:17:21.080]   --make pink headphones, OK?
[01:17:21.080 --> 01:17:23.760]   Well, after all, where is an NFL starting Lima?
[01:17:23.760 --> 01:17:28.560]   Lima going to get $5,000 to pay that fine.
[01:17:28.560 --> 01:17:29.840]   It's $10,000.
[01:17:29.840 --> 01:17:30.440]   But what the hell?
[01:17:30.440 --> 01:17:31.040]   You know, it's--
[01:17:31.040 --> 01:17:32.400]   Apparently, Bose is coming back to the album.
[01:17:32.400 --> 01:17:35.040]   $2,000 here or there.
[01:17:35.040 --> 01:17:36.360]   Yeah.
[01:17:36.360 --> 01:17:38.680]   It feels a little disrespectful to me at this point.
[01:17:38.680 --> 01:17:40.200]   Just don't wear any headphones, OK?
[01:17:40.200 --> 01:17:42.040]   You're not required to wear Bose headphones.
[01:17:42.040 --> 01:17:44.360]   OK, I've paid disrespect to the NFL.
[01:17:44.360 --> 01:17:46.040]   I thought you went the other way around.
[01:17:46.040 --> 01:17:47.200]   It's like, you know what?
[01:17:47.200 --> 01:17:49.360]   These people are grown adults.
[01:17:49.360 --> 01:17:50.520]   If you're telling them that--
[01:17:50.520 --> 01:17:51.160]   Well, that's true.
[01:17:51.160 --> 01:17:53.080]   --you can't wear whatever headphones they want to wear.
[01:17:53.080 --> 01:17:55.480]   Because I don't wear the headphones
[01:17:55.480 --> 01:17:58.280]   that have the giant rotating Beats illuminated logo
[01:17:58.280 --> 01:18:00.640]   on tape just for promotional purposes.
[01:18:00.640 --> 01:18:05.080]   But for God's sake, that's a good point.
[01:18:05.080 --> 01:18:06.960]   Maybe treat them better when they were tires.
[01:18:06.960 --> 01:18:08.880]   They don't need to pick up so much endorsement cash
[01:18:08.880 --> 01:18:10.200]   for their playing.
[01:18:10.200 --> 01:18:13.720]   Now that we know that there are an ungodly, dangerous sport,
[01:18:13.720 --> 01:18:15.520]   that's going to have lifelong repercussions,
[01:18:15.520 --> 01:18:18.560]   that the best of it is that their knees and joints
[01:18:18.560 --> 01:18:20.520]   will be shot by the time they're 43
[01:18:20.520 --> 01:18:23.360]   and that will require titanium earlobes
[01:18:23.360 --> 01:18:25.120]   by the time they're finished.
[01:18:25.120 --> 01:18:27.120]   Let them wear whatever headphones they want.
[01:18:27.120 --> 01:18:29.680]   Bose has a problem though, because there's a Beats eruption.
[01:18:29.680 --> 01:18:30.960]   I mean, all the players like Beats,
[01:18:30.960 --> 01:18:32.440]   and they all are wearing Beats.
[01:18:32.440 --> 01:18:34.800]   Because that's what the young people wear, right?
[01:18:34.800 --> 01:18:40.000]   Here's Richard Sherman in Pink Beats, some other big guy,
[01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:41.920]   gold Beats.
[01:18:41.920 --> 01:18:44.680]   There's the over-the-ear Beats.
[01:18:44.680 --> 01:18:46.640]   That's Eli Manning, isn't it?
[01:18:46.640 --> 01:18:47.760]   Oh, Brady.
[01:18:47.760 --> 01:18:48.640]   Oh, Brady, I'm sorry.
[01:18:48.640 --> 01:18:50.440]   Yeah, I could tell by the hair.
[01:18:50.440 --> 01:18:53.040]   Brady is the worst haircut ever.
[01:18:53.040 --> 01:18:54.320]   And there's Colin with his--
[01:18:54.320 --> 01:18:55.920]   And all his money on Beats.
[01:18:55.920 --> 01:18:58.520]   No money left for supercuts.
[01:18:58.520 --> 01:19:00.800]   Which looks like the razor slipped
[01:19:00.800 --> 01:19:03.160]   when they gave Colin their haircut there.
[01:19:03.160 --> 01:19:06.160]   There's a little bit of a swirl in the top.
[01:19:06.160 --> 01:19:07.720]   What happened there?
[01:19:07.720 --> 01:19:09.240]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:19:09.240 --> 01:19:10.200]   I think that's very touching.
[01:19:10.200 --> 01:19:12.480]   His part kind of went crazy there.
[01:19:12.480 --> 01:19:14.520]   Oh, maybe it's a co-marketing deal with Nike.
[01:19:14.520 --> 01:19:15.640]   Like, it's a swoosh.
[01:19:15.640 --> 01:19:17.560]   They can't make them cover up a logo
[01:19:17.560 --> 01:19:18.560]   if it's part of his body.
[01:19:18.560 --> 01:19:19.760]   Right.
[01:19:19.760 --> 01:19:20.720]   Right.
[01:19:20.720 --> 01:19:21.960]   And if it's not attached to it, that means
[01:19:21.960 --> 01:19:24.360]   it can keep changing the bidding process every single year.
[01:19:24.360 --> 01:19:28.680]   I just want to say that even though we have a deal with Beats,
[01:19:28.680 --> 01:19:31.120]   you guys, if you want to wear Bose headphones,
[01:19:31.120 --> 01:19:32.800]   you go right ahead.
[01:19:32.800 --> 01:19:33.720]   Anytime.
[01:19:33.720 --> 01:19:34.960]   Actually, we don't have a deal with anybody.
[01:19:34.960 --> 01:19:36.120]   I wish we did.
[01:19:36.120 --> 01:19:37.600]   Holy, I'll make a deal.
[01:19:37.600 --> 01:19:40.280]   iOS 8.1.2.
[01:19:40.280 --> 01:19:41.720]   When did that come out?
[01:19:41.720 --> 01:19:42.960]   Look before the show.
[01:19:42.960 --> 01:19:45.520]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:19:45.520 --> 01:19:47.120]   What's new?
[01:19:47.120 --> 01:19:48.440]   Is it a security fix?
[01:19:48.440 --> 01:19:49.680]   No, yeah, well, there's a bunch of fixes.
[01:19:49.680 --> 01:19:51.400]   But the biggest one is that previously people
[01:19:51.400 --> 01:19:53.720]   would lose ringtones or text tones.
[01:19:53.720 --> 01:19:55.920]   And because the recording industry will not allow Apple
[01:19:55.920 --> 01:19:57.320]   to make those redown loadable, you
[01:19:57.320 --> 01:19:59.440]   had to jump through hoops to try to get them back.
[01:19:59.440 --> 01:20:01.080]   And that fixes this problem.
[01:20:01.080 --> 01:20:04.000]   Fix is the ringtone issue.
[01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:06.560]   It does-- but they say this every time for more information
[01:20:06.560 --> 01:20:08.560]   on the security content, click this link.
[01:20:08.560 --> 01:20:09.520]   And then there's nothing at that link.
[01:20:09.520 --> 01:20:10.000]   Yeah, it wasn't posted.
[01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:11.440]   Yeah, it takes a while to get that up.
[01:20:11.440 --> 01:20:12.480]   Yeah.
[01:20:12.480 --> 01:20:12.960]   All right.
[01:20:12.960 --> 01:20:15.760]   So new iOS recommended.
[01:20:15.760 --> 01:20:17.360]   No problems to date?
[01:20:17.360 --> 01:20:18.160]   Yeah, I downloaded.
[01:20:18.160 --> 01:20:19.200]   I installed it right away.
[01:20:19.200 --> 01:20:21.040]   I made sure I tested everything that I could.
[01:20:21.040 --> 01:20:22.320]   And it was super solid.
[01:20:22.320 --> 01:20:25.640]   I think since iOS 8.1.1, if you had any quibbles or qualms
[01:20:25.640 --> 01:20:27.360]   about iOS 8, they've all been-- the big stuff
[01:20:27.360 --> 01:20:28.200]   has all been solved.
[01:20:28.200 --> 01:20:31.600]   And 10.10.2 Yosemite is in beta now.
[01:20:31.600 --> 01:20:32.160]   It's out.
[01:20:32.160 --> 01:20:34.840]   And this is the newest seed.
[01:20:34.840 --> 01:20:39.120]   And Apple says this time, the Wi-Fi issue is fixed.
[01:20:39.120 --> 01:20:40.160]   And Chrome 6.2.
[01:20:40.160 --> 01:20:40.880]   Chrome was crashing.
[01:20:40.880 --> 01:20:42.640]   If you had a trackpad, anytime you touch the trackpad,
[01:20:42.640 --> 01:20:43.960]   it would crash Chrome.
[01:20:43.960 --> 01:20:45.000]   And they're working again.
[01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:46.000]   Yeah.
[01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:48.160]   That was not good.
[01:20:48.160 --> 01:20:50.640]   No, it was deprecated code, but still it's not-- yeah, it's not--
[01:20:50.640 --> 01:20:53.560]   Yeah, don't crash Chrome, please.
[01:20:53.560 --> 01:20:55.560]   All right, so what do you know one will see?
[01:20:55.560 --> 01:20:56.800]   10.10.
[01:20:56.800 --> 01:20:58.080]   Oh, anytime now?
[01:20:58.080 --> 01:21:00.680]   Yeah, 470 megabytes.
[01:21:00.680 --> 01:21:03.040]   If you already are in the pre-release version,
[01:21:03.040 --> 01:21:04.720]   you can download it from the App Store.
[01:21:04.720 --> 01:21:08.240]   In fact, it's probably been pushed upon you.
[01:21:08.240 --> 01:21:09.880]   It got really good at that process.
[01:21:09.880 --> 01:21:11.880]   You have to actually go and turn it off now if you stop--
[01:21:11.880 --> 01:21:14.000]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:17.160]   Taipo, the company that was started by--
[01:21:17.160 --> 01:21:18.600]   was it Ashton Kutcher?
[01:21:18.600 --> 01:21:19.160]   Ryan Seacrest.
[01:21:19.160 --> 01:21:20.680]   Ryan Seacrest, I confused those two.
[01:21:20.680 --> 01:21:22.160]   I don't know why.
[01:21:22.160 --> 01:21:23.240]   Pretty distinguishable.
[01:21:23.240 --> 01:21:25.760]   Yeah.
[01:21:25.760 --> 01:21:27.560]   He's now doing an iPhone 6 version.
[01:21:27.560 --> 01:21:29.800]   That's the little BlackBerry style,
[01:21:29.800 --> 01:21:31.120]   effect BlackBerry suit him.
[01:21:31.120 --> 01:21:34.080]   Keyboard that slips on is a case to your iPhone.
[01:21:34.080 --> 01:21:36.760]   Yeah, this is a Taipo 2, which they claim doesn't--
[01:21:36.760 --> 01:21:41.080]   Doesn't look as much like BlackBerry, I have to say.
[01:21:41.080 --> 01:21:41.960]   A lot of people love that.
[01:21:41.960 --> 01:21:45.000]   Steve Gibson bought a bunch of them for his old iPhone.
[01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:47.800]   Yeah, and I'm glad there are options out there for you.
[01:21:47.800 --> 01:21:49.840]   But wow, at this point, some people
[01:21:49.840 --> 01:21:52.640]   have just-- especially with the software keyboards that
[01:21:52.640 --> 01:21:57.400]   give you swipe and predictive typing that are arguably--
[01:21:57.400 --> 01:22:00.520]   I think that we're losing a generation of people who even
[01:22:00.520 --> 01:22:02.720]   understand what it is like to type with a keyboard like that
[01:22:02.720 --> 01:22:04.160]   on a mobile device.
[01:22:04.160 --> 01:22:05.200]   And then we get to the--
[01:22:05.200 --> 01:22:08.840]   OK, so you're going to name your company
[01:22:08.840 --> 01:22:11.840]   after inaccurate typing.
[01:22:11.840 --> 01:22:13.520]   Have you guys tried the BlackBerry Passport yet
[01:22:13.520 --> 01:22:15.320]   with its really long keyboard?
[01:22:15.320 --> 01:22:16.040]   Yeah.
[01:22:16.040 --> 01:22:17.000]   Yeah, it's interesting.
[01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:17.520]   What do you think?
[01:22:17.520 --> 01:22:19.320]   That was--
[01:22:19.320 --> 01:22:22.680]   If you have square content, it's fantastic.
[01:22:22.680 --> 01:22:25.120]   Yeah, my content doesn't square.
[01:22:25.120 --> 01:22:27.000]   I have square content.
[01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:27.480]   Instagram.
[01:22:27.480 --> 01:22:29.600]   If you do a lot of Instagram or Excel sheets,
[01:22:29.600 --> 01:22:31.680]   yeah, it's really good.
[01:22:31.680 --> 01:22:34.120]   I thought it was just different for the sake of difference.
[01:22:34.120 --> 01:22:35.720]   It's like if you're-- at this point,
[01:22:35.720 --> 01:22:38.480]   either you have a compelling reason.
[01:22:38.480 --> 01:22:40.600]   I also met-- for two weeks ago, I
[01:22:40.600 --> 01:22:43.800]   met the first person in my life that I knew
[01:22:43.800 --> 01:22:46.360]   drinks a sort of new England called Moxie.
[01:22:46.360 --> 01:22:46.880]   Moxie!
[01:22:46.880 --> 01:22:47.520]   It's like--
[01:22:47.520 --> 01:22:48.200]   Oh, sorry.
[01:22:48.200 --> 01:22:50.080]   And it's horrible stuff.
[01:22:50.080 --> 01:22:53.560]   I've never met anybody who drinks it and likes it.
[01:22:53.560 --> 01:22:56.080]   I've rarely even heard of such a thing.
[01:22:56.080 --> 01:22:57.840]   And again, I've lived in New England
[01:22:57.840 --> 01:23:00.280]   for more than four decades now at this point.
[01:23:00.280 --> 01:23:03.280]   First contact with this species.
[01:23:03.280 --> 01:23:06.200]   But there are people who like what they like,
[01:23:06.200 --> 01:23:08.320]   even if it's not something that other people like.
[01:23:08.320 --> 01:23:11.360]   And so Blackberry is really in that sort of category.
[01:23:11.360 --> 01:23:13.440]   It is the Moxie of smartphones at this point,
[01:23:13.440 --> 01:23:17.160]   where the people who love it are in a position where,
[01:23:17.160 --> 01:23:20.640]   if this is the phone I like, there is nothing else like it.
[01:23:20.640 --> 01:23:23.720]   And so there are no options but to the Nirvana
[01:23:23.720 --> 01:23:26.240]   that Blackberry is creating for me.
[01:23:26.240 --> 01:23:28.400]   But anybody else who's not inside that group
[01:23:28.400 --> 01:23:31.240]   is never going to be converted to it at this point.
[01:23:31.240 --> 01:23:34.120]   What flavor is Moxie?
[01:23:34.120 --> 01:23:39.120]   Well, if you left a car battery out after a long rain
[01:23:39.120 --> 01:23:40.080]   and then you put your mouth--
[01:23:40.080 --> 01:23:43.760]   I mean, I'm talking right on the positive terminal.
[01:23:43.760 --> 01:23:45.120]   That's pretty much what it's like.
[01:23:45.120 --> 01:23:47.440]   It sneaks up on you after--
[01:23:47.440 --> 01:23:49.600]   In New England grocery stores, again,
[01:23:49.600 --> 01:23:52.120]   there's like walls and walls of all kinds of different flavors.
[01:23:52.120 --> 01:23:55.440]   And there's always like four six packs of Moxie,
[01:23:55.440 --> 01:23:57.640]   two two liter bottles, and that's it.
[01:23:57.640 --> 01:24:00.240]   And so once I actually bought a can of this stuff--
[01:24:00.240 --> 01:24:03.160]   because, well, I'm just curious as to why there's
[01:24:03.160 --> 01:24:06.040]   a market for four six packs in every single store.
[01:24:06.040 --> 01:24:08.680]   And I poured it out and it was nice and cold.
[01:24:08.680 --> 01:24:13.360]   I took a drink and it tasted like a not terribly good colon.
[01:24:13.360 --> 01:24:15.480]   I thought, OK, I mean, it's bad, but it's not awful.
[01:24:15.480 --> 01:24:18.680]   But it had that sort of thing where it was just after 30 seconds,
[01:24:18.680 --> 01:24:21.280]   it was interacting with the chemicals inside my mouth.
[01:24:21.280 --> 01:24:23.640]   And I swear to God, I actually had
[01:24:23.640 --> 01:24:25.800]   to brush my tongue to get the flavor out.
[01:24:25.800 --> 01:24:28.160]   Because it was just mounting and mounting.
[01:24:28.160 --> 01:24:29.600]   It's like you see these videos of people
[01:24:29.600 --> 01:24:32.760]   who take a bite into a pepper, like super hot pepper?
[01:24:32.760 --> 01:24:34.920]   And like, oh, I don't know why people are complaining.
[01:24:34.920 --> 01:24:36.120]   This isn't bad at all.
[01:24:36.120 --> 01:24:38.680]   Then 30 seconds later, they're like, ah!
[01:24:38.680 --> 01:24:39.720]   It comes from here.
[01:24:39.720 --> 01:24:43.120]   When soda pop was really considered a medicine, in fact,
[01:24:43.120 --> 01:24:45.280]   it was one of the very first soda pops, if not the first soda
[01:24:45.280 --> 01:24:45.840]   pop.
[01:24:45.840 --> 01:24:48.440]   And so it really has a medicinal kind of a--
[01:24:48.440 --> 01:24:50.760]   It's like chemo therapeutic sort of effect.
[01:24:50.760 --> 01:24:54.480]   I think it writes about the store in Maine, which I don't know
[01:24:54.480 --> 01:24:57.480]   if it's still there, sells nothing but Moxie.
[01:24:57.480 --> 01:24:58.840]   A Moxie store?
[01:24:58.840 --> 01:25:02.040]   Again, if you like Moxie, there's only one soda like it.
[01:25:02.040 --> 01:25:03.680]   And that's how you--
[01:25:03.680 --> 01:25:07.280]   Say, say the passport is the Moxie of smartphones.
[01:25:07.280 --> 01:25:09.280]   And not necessarily in a bad way either.
[01:25:09.280 --> 01:25:12.360]   I'm saying that there are people that are always going to like,
[01:25:12.360 --> 01:25:13.800]   I want a tactile keyboard.
[01:25:13.800 --> 01:25:17.240]   I want this sort of attitude towards business communications.
[01:25:17.240 --> 01:25:20.640]   And now that's not really what anybody else is interested in
[01:25:20.640 --> 01:25:21.240]   at this point.
[01:25:21.240 --> 01:25:23.480]   I've received several hate messages from people
[01:25:23.480 --> 01:25:28.480]   who say you do not cover the Blackberry sufficiently.
[01:25:28.480 --> 01:25:30.000]   I'm no longer listening to you.
[01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:32.520]   Because you can still see a little corner of a peeking out.
[01:25:32.520 --> 01:25:33.920]   Just move the napkin a little bit more.
[01:25:33.920 --> 01:25:34.400]   There you go.
[01:25:34.400 --> 01:25:35.480]   Now we can't see it at all.
[01:25:35.480 --> 01:25:36.240]   But now we have coverage.
[01:25:36.240 --> 01:25:36.760]   This is it.
[01:25:36.760 --> 01:25:37.560]   You're recovering it.
[01:25:37.560 --> 01:25:38.720]   I don't know what to say.
[01:25:38.720 --> 01:25:42.480]   You know, Renee defended.
[01:25:42.480 --> 01:25:43.880]   It's from your country.
[01:25:43.880 --> 01:25:46.800]   Should I cover-- should we do more coverage of Blackberry?
[01:25:46.800 --> 01:25:49.960]   It's huge in Indonesia, Leo.
[01:25:49.960 --> 01:25:52.040]   I think it's the same guy who keeps writing me the email.
[01:25:52.040 --> 01:25:54.400]   But it's possible that there is a ground spell of four or five
[01:25:54.400 --> 01:25:55.080]   people who care.
[01:25:55.080 --> 01:25:56.080]   I like that there's choice.
[01:25:56.080 --> 01:25:57.800]   I like that there's people trying different things.
[01:25:57.800 --> 01:25:59.520]   I mean, it's the same way I can give you for a Samsung
[01:25:59.520 --> 01:26:01.240]   that if you throw enough stuff at the wall, good ideas
[01:26:01.240 --> 01:26:03.080]   will filter down.
[01:26:03.080 --> 01:26:05.480]   They've just made so many miscalculations in the market
[01:26:05.480 --> 01:26:07.080]   that it's going to be tremendously difficult for them
[01:26:07.080 --> 01:26:09.360]   to come back to relevance anytime soon, which is sad.
[01:26:09.360 --> 01:26:12.000]   Because I like the fact that Canada has an operating system.
[01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:14.120]   They have two because they bought QNX as well.
[01:26:14.120 --> 01:26:17.960]   So I mean, I was a huge Blackberry fan,
[01:26:17.960 --> 01:26:21.320]   had all the Blackberry phones right up to 2007.
[01:26:21.320 --> 01:26:24.200]   And then all of a sudden, this thing called the iPhone
[01:26:24.200 --> 01:26:27.400]   came along and it was kind of all over.
[01:26:27.400 --> 01:26:30.600]   The Orion spacecraft, a little kind of trivial note here,
[01:26:30.600 --> 01:26:35.160]   the Orion spacecraft, which is NASA's newest spacecraft
[01:26:35.160 --> 01:26:41.120]   and launch engine designed to bring crews to Mars and beyond.
[01:26:41.120 --> 01:26:42.840]   Did they actually launch last week?
[01:26:42.840 --> 01:26:45.680]   I know they were planning to, but then I heard it was scrubbed.
[01:26:45.680 --> 01:26:47.360]   It was delayed for a day.
[01:26:47.360 --> 01:26:49.560]   It had a completely successful mission.
[01:26:49.560 --> 01:26:52.840]   Did two orbits splash down and it's completely recovered.
[01:26:52.840 --> 01:26:54.320]   It contains a computer.
[01:26:54.320 --> 01:26:57.440]   Now remember, the computers that go out in space
[01:26:57.440 --> 01:26:59.000]   have to be hardened in special ways
[01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:02.040]   because there's more cosmic rays, there's lots of issues.
[01:27:02.040 --> 01:27:06.400]   Reliability is much more important than speed.
[01:27:06.400 --> 01:27:12.880]   But the PowerPC chip in the Orion man module
[01:27:12.880 --> 01:27:16.120]   is exactly as identical to the PowerPC
[01:27:16.120 --> 01:27:20.960]   from the iBook G3 that came out in 2003.
[01:27:20.960 --> 01:27:24.600]   It's the same as the 750 FX.
[01:27:24.600 --> 01:27:28.160]   I think it is space hardened.
[01:27:28.160 --> 01:27:30.000]   I think all of our NASA's vehicles
[01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:33.960]   have been using chips based on the PowerPC platform for some time.
[01:27:33.960 --> 01:27:42.680]   900 megahertz, bus speed of 166 megahertz, 512K online L2 cache.
[01:27:42.680 --> 01:27:45.400]   Actually manufactured with a 130 nanometer process,
[01:27:45.400 --> 01:27:49.240]   which is pretty good, probably better than--
[01:27:49.240 --> 01:27:51.760]   well, maybe not, but we're down to 14 nanometers currently
[01:27:51.760 --> 01:27:55.840]   with a core M. But they say, according to this article,
[01:27:55.840 --> 01:27:59.480]   from geek.com, it's about as powerful as the arm chip used
[01:27:59.480 --> 01:28:01.240]   in the Galaxy S3.
[01:28:01.240 --> 01:28:05.120]   And that's all you need for the Orion spacecraft.
[01:28:05.120 --> 01:28:06.640]   Easy.
[01:28:06.640 --> 01:28:08.120]   Kind of cool.
[01:28:08.120 --> 01:28:09.040]   It's amazing.
[01:28:09.040 --> 01:28:11.280]   This is why I'm not quite so bummed out
[01:28:11.280 --> 01:28:16.000]   about the laps in like crude spacecraft, human spacecraft
[01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:18.560]   that take people to the moon and Mars and stuff.
[01:28:18.560 --> 01:28:22.320]   Because we've got so many really cool things out there as it is.
[01:28:22.320 --> 01:28:26.760]   Orion is exciting because it's not just designed for one mission
[01:28:26.760 --> 01:28:30.160]   to ferry people from the ISS to the ground and back again.
[01:28:30.160 --> 01:28:33.480]   I mean, there is a spacecraft called stereo, actually,
[01:28:33.480 --> 01:28:39.440]   two spacecraft that are here to image the sun at all times.
[01:28:39.440 --> 01:28:43.280]   And just to show you how interesting these long-term multi-year
[01:28:43.280 --> 01:28:43.800]   missions are.
[01:28:43.800 --> 01:28:46.720]   So one of them is out of commission only because it sort
[01:28:46.720 --> 01:28:48.520]   of like tilted the wrong way.
[01:28:48.520 --> 01:28:51.800]   But at some point, it will continue to rotate and out solar panels
[01:28:51.800 --> 01:28:53.880]   will get enough energy that can do another maneuver
[01:28:53.880 --> 01:28:56.200]   and get the get its mission back.
[01:28:56.200 --> 01:29:00.560]   And there's a pick of the week that I was going to pick.
[01:29:00.560 --> 01:29:03.320]   But I have to delay it for a week because I don't really
[01:29:03.320 --> 01:29:05.080]   understand enough to talk about it yet.
[01:29:05.080 --> 01:29:07.520]   But there's one app that has every single space,
[01:29:07.520 --> 01:29:09.480]   whether piece of information collected
[01:29:09.480 --> 01:29:13.000]   that NASA has generated, all in one single app.
[01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:15.000]   And it just gives you an impression of here's
[01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:19.000]   how many spacecraft are out there on decades-long missions
[01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:22.520]   that are bringing back data every single moment of the day
[01:29:22.520 --> 01:29:25.320]   that is incredibly useful and even compelling to people
[01:29:25.320 --> 01:29:28.600]   who do not have PhDs in the correct sciences.
[01:29:28.600 --> 01:29:29.960]   So much great stuff is happening.
[01:29:29.960 --> 01:29:34.400]   And the design of these things, what they can do on essentially
[01:29:34.400 --> 01:29:39.480]   a watch battery and a Simon game CPU is just mind-boggling.
[01:29:39.480 --> 01:29:44.000]   I have-- if you're interested in this,
[01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:45.960]   we did an interview on "Translation" last week
[01:29:45.960 --> 01:29:50.360]   with the program manager for Mars Curiosity
[01:29:50.360 --> 01:29:54.000]   who is currently working on future Mars projects.
[01:29:54.000 --> 01:29:55.080]   Really interesting.
[01:29:55.080 --> 01:29:56.080]   He was great.
[01:29:56.080 --> 01:29:58.000]   It was really fascinating.
[01:29:58.000 --> 01:29:58.800]   Let's see.
[01:29:58.800 --> 01:30:00.440]   Just a couple more stories that we want to take a break
[01:30:00.440 --> 01:30:04.600]   and get to our picks of the week because it's time to wrap this up.
[01:30:04.600 --> 01:30:06.680]   I was talking about the app projections if they're on there.
[01:30:06.680 --> 01:30:07.200]   Go ahead.
[01:30:07.200 --> 01:30:07.360]   Yeah.
[01:30:07.360 --> 01:30:08.840]   Let's do it.
[01:30:08.840 --> 01:30:11.360]   So I did-- I tried to explain what was going on
[01:30:11.360 --> 01:30:12.040]   with some of these.
[01:30:12.040 --> 01:30:13.480]   But it's really difficult because--
[01:30:13.480 --> 01:30:15.120]   Are these the pirates-based stuff?
[01:30:15.120 --> 01:30:16.040]   What are we?
[01:30:16.040 --> 01:30:17.400]   There's a couple things going on.
[01:30:17.400 --> 01:30:19.800]   So Apple introduced extensibility at WWDC.
[01:30:19.800 --> 01:30:21.880]   And it arguably is the biggest change to the App Store
[01:30:21.880 --> 01:30:23.400]   since the App Store launched.
[01:30:23.400 --> 01:30:26.360]   And a bunch of apps were approved that now are being rejected.
[01:30:26.360 --> 01:30:28.800]   Some of them are getting put back in.
[01:30:28.800 --> 01:30:30.480]   So some people understand what happens.
[01:30:30.480 --> 01:30:34.840]   When new technologies reduce, developers rush to make apps to use them
[01:30:34.840 --> 01:30:36.920]   because Apple wants to promote those technologies
[01:30:36.920 --> 01:30:38.480]   and they'll often be featured.
[01:30:38.480 --> 01:30:40.640]   Meanwhile, Apple tries to get the software finished.
[01:30:40.640 --> 01:30:42.120]   So in this case, iOS 8.
[01:30:42.120 --> 01:30:43.960]   And developer relations, the review teams,
[01:30:43.960 --> 01:30:45.920]   try to get as many apps approved as possible.
[01:30:45.920 --> 01:30:48.360]   As soon as an app is approved, the editorial team, which
[01:30:48.360 --> 01:30:50.320]   is not under the same division, tries
[01:30:50.320 --> 01:30:51.600]   to get them featured on the App Store
[01:30:51.600 --> 01:30:53.560]   because they want people to find all these apps.
[01:30:53.560 --> 01:30:54.600]   And it's a huge race.
[01:30:54.600 --> 01:30:56.520]   And not everyone is paying as much attention as they can
[01:30:56.520 --> 01:30:58.000]   because there's just so many apps.
[01:30:58.000 --> 01:31:00.560]   And then later, as the apps come for re-review or reviewers,
[01:31:00.560 --> 01:31:02.440]   see them, they reject them because they're
[01:31:02.440 --> 01:31:04.720]   not in keeping with the original ideas that Apple had
[01:31:04.720 --> 01:31:08.760]   for how widgets or extensions or cloud providers should be used.
[01:31:08.760 --> 01:31:10.160]   So for example, they originally didn't
[01:31:10.160 --> 01:31:12.680]   want you lingering in the notification center.
[01:31:12.680 --> 01:31:14.800]   So they wanted you to do something quick and get out.
[01:31:14.800 --> 01:31:17.920]   And peak help, you could actually spend all your time in there.
[01:31:17.920 --> 01:31:20.280]   Or with drafts, they wanted the button to stay in widgets,
[01:31:20.280 --> 01:31:22.760]   but the button in drafts sent you from the widget back
[01:31:22.760 --> 01:31:23.640]   to the app.
[01:31:23.640 --> 01:31:26.960]   And now the latest one, which is Panix, with iCloud Drive.
[01:31:26.960 --> 01:31:29.400]   On OS 10, you can do anything you want with iCloud Drive.
[01:31:29.400 --> 01:31:32.520]   But on iOS, they wanted to restrict it to only files
[01:31:32.520 --> 01:31:34.640]   that you created or edited in those apps.
[01:31:34.640 --> 01:31:37.520]   And Panik would let you upload arbitrary files.
[01:31:37.520 --> 01:31:38.840]   So these are being rejected.
[01:31:38.840 --> 01:31:42.320]   And it's tough because editorialists featured these apps
[01:31:42.320 --> 01:31:44.000]   because they were originally approved.
[01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:47.560]   Developers, users have gotten used to using those features.
[01:31:47.560 --> 01:31:49.360]   And there is an appeals process at Apple,
[01:31:49.360 --> 01:31:52.400]   all the way up to the executive committee for the App Store.
[01:31:52.400 --> 01:31:54.080]   And peak out got re-approved, but it
[01:31:54.080 --> 01:31:55.880]   doesn't look like the drafts widget will be,
[01:31:55.880 --> 01:31:57.040]   the keyboard widget.
[01:31:57.040 --> 01:31:59.080]   It's unsure what's going to happen with Panik.
[01:31:59.080 --> 01:32:01.840]   And it creates this thing where Apple gets tons of negative press.
[01:32:01.840 --> 01:32:04.000]   Developers have no idea what's going to be approved
[01:32:04.000 --> 01:32:05.160]   and what's not going to be approved.
[01:32:05.160 --> 01:32:06.640]   So they have a huge chilling effect.
[01:32:06.640 --> 01:32:09.000]   And we get functionality that we might have come to rely on
[01:32:09.000 --> 01:32:10.320]   taken away from us.
[01:32:10.320 --> 01:32:12.160]   And I'm hard pressed to find better solutions
[01:32:12.160 --> 01:32:13.320]   because they all have negatives, too.
[01:32:13.320 --> 01:32:17.080]   But it seems like once again, we're back in 2008, 2009,
[01:32:17.080 --> 01:32:19.880]   where it's just impossible to tell from one day to another
[01:32:19.880 --> 01:32:21.640]   what's going to be rejected and what's not.
[01:32:21.640 --> 01:32:24.600]   So draft, which you've picked as a pick of the week
[01:32:24.600 --> 01:32:27.080]   from Panik software, does what?
[01:32:27.080 --> 01:32:27.960]   And transit.
[01:32:27.960 --> 01:32:28.960]   Transit was--
[01:32:28.960 --> 01:32:29.480]   A transit.
[01:32:29.480 --> 01:32:31.160]   It was letting you upload any transmit.
[01:32:31.160 --> 01:32:32.160]   Transmit.
[01:32:32.160 --> 01:32:35.720]   Yeah, it was letting you upload arbitrary files to iCloud Drive
[01:32:35.720 --> 01:32:36.720]   or other providers.
[01:32:36.720 --> 01:32:40.480]   And so here's drafts, which you refer to in the article.
[01:32:40.480 --> 01:32:42.000]   What does drafts do?
[01:32:42.000 --> 01:32:43.120]   You could hit that plus button.
[01:32:43.120 --> 01:32:45.720]   It would take you to the app and start a new draft.
[01:32:45.720 --> 01:32:46.400]   OK.
[01:32:46.400 --> 01:32:50.120]   So the idea was quick open a document.
[01:32:50.120 --> 01:32:50.600]   Yeah.
[01:32:50.600 --> 01:32:51.760]   So they previously--
[01:32:51.760 --> 01:32:54.600]   And much I really like and pre-populated
[01:32:54.600 --> 01:32:56.160]   with what's on the clipboard.
[01:32:56.160 --> 01:32:56.400]   Yeah.
[01:32:56.400 --> 01:33:00.720]   So the previously Apple rejected launchers from widgets
[01:33:00.720 --> 01:33:02.080]   because they didn't want one app launching.
[01:33:02.080 --> 01:33:04.080]   Another app turns out they don't want apps launching.
[01:33:04.080 --> 01:33:05.520]   And one of the problems is that people
[01:33:05.520 --> 01:33:06.520]   say Apple is doing this.
[01:33:06.520 --> 01:33:08.440]   But Apple has different organizations.
[01:33:08.440 --> 01:33:09.840]   There's a bunch of different people involved.
[01:33:09.840 --> 01:33:11.280]   They all have different opinions.
[01:33:11.280 --> 01:33:12.960]   And there are different opinions on what these widgets
[01:33:12.960 --> 01:33:13.800]   shouldn't do.
[01:33:13.800 --> 01:33:15.960]   And it looks like sometimes some people are winning.
[01:33:15.960 --> 01:33:17.200]   Other times other people are winning.
[01:33:17.200 --> 01:33:19.480]   But from the outside, it just looks capricious and arbitrary.
[01:33:19.480 --> 01:33:19.960]   Right.
[01:33:19.960 --> 01:33:20.480]   Well, because--
[01:33:20.480 --> 01:33:22.480]   Most of you are a developer.
[01:33:22.480 --> 01:33:24.040]   Because it is.
[01:33:24.040 --> 01:33:25.880]   I mean, when you--
[01:33:25.880 --> 01:33:28.680]   it is true that internally there are all kinds of debates
[01:33:28.680 --> 01:33:30.600]   and there's a discussion about what the appropriate use
[01:33:30.600 --> 01:33:32.840]   of certain widget actions are.
[01:33:32.840 --> 01:33:33.480]   God dang it.
[01:33:33.480 --> 01:33:34.360]   Sorry about this.
[01:33:34.360 --> 01:33:36.440]   Of course, I had exactly the document
[01:33:36.440 --> 01:33:37.960]   that I needed to talk about this open.
[01:33:37.960 --> 01:33:40.240]   And now I've had to restart my MacBook.
[01:33:40.240 --> 01:33:46.040]   But it's exactly as Renee says, that there are all
[01:33:46.040 --> 01:33:47.800]   about kinds of different--
[01:33:47.800 --> 01:33:50.000]   not just factions of thought inside of Apple,
[01:33:50.000 --> 01:33:51.880]   but different companies, so to speak,
[01:33:51.880 --> 01:33:53.920]   inside of Apple that have different--
[01:33:53.920 --> 01:33:56.240]   we'll talk about different things for different reasons.
[01:33:56.240 --> 01:33:57.920]   And their wires get crossed a lot.
[01:33:57.920 --> 01:34:02.160]   But the thing is, Apple is not a garage startup.
[01:34:02.160 --> 01:34:03.800]   They're not a kitchen sink production.
[01:34:03.800 --> 01:34:05.680]   You kitchen table production with eight people.
[01:34:05.680 --> 01:34:09.800]   They are one of the largest tech titans in this world.
[01:34:09.800 --> 01:34:12.200]   They should have their act together.
[01:34:12.200 --> 01:34:15.840]   And so problem-- it seems like a problem
[01:34:15.840 --> 01:34:18.040]   that they should be able to solve,
[01:34:18.040 --> 01:34:20.400]   that they don't just simply put an app out there
[01:34:20.400 --> 01:34:23.440]   and then decide, oh, wait, with the one voice,
[01:34:23.440 --> 01:34:25.240]   the external voice that Apple has,
[01:34:25.240 --> 01:34:28.400]   they say that this app obeys all of our rules
[01:34:28.400 --> 01:34:29.880]   and we want our users to have it.
[01:34:29.880 --> 01:34:32.720]   And then, no, actually, this app does not obey our rules.
[01:34:32.720 --> 01:34:35.520]   We do not want our users to have it.
[01:34:35.520 --> 01:34:37.640]   The second thing that's kind of troubling--
[01:34:37.640 --> 01:34:41.360]   and I hope that I can get this back up again--
[01:34:41.360 --> 01:34:44.600]   the developer of launcher had a really good blog post.
[01:34:44.600 --> 01:34:46.960]   And I really wanted to be able to quote it directly.
[01:34:46.960 --> 01:34:48.520]   I hope someone else can pull it up,
[01:34:48.520 --> 01:34:50.040]   because again, I'm restarting right now.
[01:34:50.040 --> 01:34:52.000]   But he's saying that when he was-- in his conversations
[01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:54.440]   with Apple about why his app was rejected
[01:34:54.440 --> 01:34:58.920]   for similar reasons from iOS 8, it was originally accepted
[01:34:58.920 --> 01:35:01.400]   and then rejected later on and had to be removed.
[01:35:01.400 --> 01:35:04.200]   They said that they occasionally--
[01:35:04.200 --> 01:35:06.560]   this is from his conversations with Apple--
[01:35:06.560 --> 01:35:13.400]   that sometimes Apple will use an app as an example,
[01:35:13.400 --> 01:35:18.240]   because this is according to his blog post.
[01:35:18.240 --> 01:35:22.040]   The best way to get the word out about what a developer should
[01:35:22.040 --> 01:35:25.000]   not do is to have a high profile takedown
[01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:28.480]   so that people can know about this, they will look at this,
[01:35:28.480 --> 01:35:31.600]   try to figure out what it was that this one app did
[01:35:31.600 --> 01:35:34.760]   that they should now not do in the future.
[01:35:34.760 --> 01:35:38.880]   I don't know-- again, this is based on this person's description
[01:35:38.880 --> 01:35:40.040]   of his conversations with Apple.
[01:35:40.040 --> 01:35:41.200]   Not something that I know of.
[01:35:41.200 --> 01:35:44.760]   Greg Gardner, who is a creator at Chromium Lab's.
[01:35:44.760 --> 01:35:45.600]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:35:45.600 --> 01:35:47.240]   It's a really, really very good--
[01:35:47.240 --> 01:35:49.040]   There is a change.org petition.
[01:35:49.040 --> 01:35:51.560]   I don't know if you could petition Apple for anything.
[01:35:51.560 --> 01:35:52.080]   Yeah.
[01:35:52.080 --> 01:35:55.160]   So I mean, if that's true, that's kind of remarkable
[01:35:55.160 --> 01:35:58.320]   that they would let this person spin their wheels eight months
[01:35:58.320 --> 01:36:00.240]   to development on an app just to--
[01:36:00.240 --> 01:36:01.760]   we feel as though this is good.
[01:36:01.760 --> 01:36:05.120]   We can use you to make a statement to deliver a message.
[01:36:05.120 --> 01:36:06.840]   So I don't know if this is true or not.
[01:36:06.840 --> 01:36:09.680]   I think it would be remarkable if it were as simple
[01:36:09.680 --> 01:36:11.240]   as he's describing.
[01:36:11.240 --> 01:36:15.200]   But even beyond that, there's the problem of I really
[01:36:15.200 --> 01:36:19.680]   don't think that great apps get written if developers aren't
[01:36:19.680 --> 01:36:22.360]   allowed to stretch the rules a little bit, to say,
[01:36:22.360 --> 01:36:25.480]   here is technically what you are allowing me to do with this.
[01:36:25.480 --> 01:36:27.600]   And so therefore, I'm going to use this
[01:36:27.600 --> 01:36:30.200]   in a very special and different way
[01:36:30.200 --> 01:36:32.080]   that no one has ever considered before.
[01:36:32.080 --> 01:36:34.640]   That's how brilliant stuff gets created.
[01:36:34.640 --> 01:36:37.720]   Once you say that no, we have thought ahead to the nine
[01:36:37.720 --> 01:36:40.360]   ways that this API can be used.
[01:36:40.360 --> 01:36:42.080]   You are not allowed to create a tenth way
[01:36:42.080 --> 01:36:43.680]   that this is going to be used.
[01:36:43.680 --> 01:36:45.880]   I think I worry that five years down the road,
[01:36:45.880 --> 01:36:49.320]   that leads to a very boring catalog of apps that can never
[01:36:49.320 --> 01:36:50.440]   really surprise us.
[01:36:50.440 --> 01:36:55.680]   So I just hope this isn't a sign of bad things to come.
[01:36:55.680 --> 01:36:57.040]   Greg writes, at this point, I've become
[01:36:57.040 --> 01:36:59.360]   quite disillusioned with iOS development.
[01:36:59.360 --> 01:37:01.200]   And Apple is a company and seemed they were opening up
[01:37:01.200 --> 01:37:04.400]   the platform and allowing for you full and allowing
[01:37:04.400 --> 01:37:07.440]   for more inter-app communications in iOS 8.
[01:37:07.440 --> 01:37:09.720]   But this decision shows they still feel they know what's best
[01:37:09.720 --> 01:37:13.480]   for the users, even if users disagree.
[01:37:13.480 --> 01:37:15.280]   But they have difference of opinion internally
[01:37:15.280 --> 01:37:16.440]   as to what's better for the user.
[01:37:16.440 --> 01:37:17.240]   Like I think what I understand--
[01:37:17.240 --> 01:37:19.080]   By the way, I just got to point out your article
[01:37:19.080 --> 01:37:20.920]   and I'm more has right next to it.
[01:37:20.920 --> 01:37:23.240]   A nice big ad for the Moto X, which I highly recommend
[01:37:23.240 --> 01:37:25.720]   if people are bothered by this, they go out and buy.
[01:37:25.720 --> 01:37:28.360]   That's why I do not use an iPhone.
[01:37:28.360 --> 01:37:30.800]   This is the slippery slope you go down when you say,
[01:37:30.800 --> 01:37:32.360]   we are going to tightly control what's
[01:37:32.360 --> 01:37:34.280]   available on this platform.
[01:37:34.280 --> 01:37:37.080]   So the one thing that I think is different than--
[01:37:37.080 --> 01:37:38.240]   I think Annie's absolutely right.
[01:37:38.240 --> 01:37:39.880]   But the one thing is that they don't put these rules
[01:37:39.880 --> 01:37:42.240]   because there are a lot of people from engineering
[01:37:42.240 --> 01:37:45.280]   to app store management who want to see those kinds of apps.
[01:37:45.280 --> 01:37:46.080]   And they don't want it.
[01:37:46.080 --> 01:37:47.640]   Like for example, if they made a no calculator
[01:37:47.640 --> 01:37:50.480]   widget in-- no calculator rule for widgets,
[01:37:50.480 --> 01:37:51.640]   we wouldn't get PCALIC.
[01:37:51.640 --> 01:37:52.760]   But because that rule didn't exist,
[01:37:52.760 --> 01:37:53.560]   James Thompson made it.
[01:37:53.560 --> 01:37:54.920]   Someone tried to reject it.
[01:37:54.920 --> 01:37:56.840]   It got appealed and it got bumped up and someone said,
[01:37:56.840 --> 01:37:57.720]   no, no, this is great.
[01:37:57.720 --> 01:37:59.040]   We want this kind of app.
[01:37:59.040 --> 01:38:00.720]   And that'll happen with a few examples.
[01:38:00.720 --> 01:38:02.680]   And over time, that'll get sorted out.
[01:38:02.680 --> 01:38:03.720]   We won't get these rejections.
[01:38:03.720 --> 01:38:05.800]   But it's a horrible way to sort out that product.
[01:38:05.800 --> 01:38:08.120]   This is what happens when you set yourself up as an arbiter.
[01:38:08.120 --> 01:38:10.040]   And I think it's just--
[01:38:10.040 --> 01:38:10.960]   that's why I prefer it.
[01:38:10.960 --> 01:38:14.160]   It's really one of the chief reasons I prefer Android.
[01:38:14.160 --> 01:38:15.400]   Period.
[01:38:15.400 --> 01:38:19.960]   Well, it's just a difference in philosophy.
[01:38:19.960 --> 01:38:21.400]   But it's a philosophy that--
[01:38:21.400 --> 01:38:24.800]   I mean, it's an early reject and here you're seeing exactly why.
[01:38:24.800 --> 01:38:27.120]   But I'm saying there's positives and negatives.
[01:38:27.120 --> 01:38:29.040]   This morning, again, with the hellacious rain,
[01:38:29.040 --> 01:38:30.560]   it really did-- I'm looking at the things
[01:38:30.560 --> 01:38:32.400]   we might be talking about today.
[01:38:32.400 --> 01:38:34.960]   And it really did occur to me that this rain is symbolic
[01:38:34.960 --> 01:38:37.480]   of the difference between the Android approach
[01:38:37.480 --> 01:38:40.920]   and the iOS approach, where it is raining like hell outside.
[01:38:40.920 --> 01:38:44.000]   The iOS answer is, I'm not going to let you leave the house
[01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:46.160]   because you're going to get soaked if you go out there.
[01:38:46.160 --> 01:38:48.240]   No, I'm not going to let you leave the house.
[01:38:48.240 --> 01:38:51.760]   The Android-- and so that's good because you
[01:38:51.760 --> 01:38:52.560]   are going to get soaked.
[01:38:52.560 --> 01:38:53.800]   You don't want to get wet.
[01:38:53.800 --> 01:38:56.480]   Believe me, you'll thank me later that you
[01:38:56.480 --> 01:38:58.560]   decided to do your errands four hours from now
[01:38:58.560 --> 01:38:59.840]   when it's sunny outside.
[01:38:59.840 --> 01:39:01.800]   The Android approach is, I'm not going to tell you
[01:39:01.800 --> 01:39:02.680]   it's raining outside.
[01:39:02.680 --> 01:39:04.280]   You do get soaked sometimes.
[01:39:04.280 --> 01:39:06.880]   But you do have the ability to say, yeah, I really--
[01:39:06.880 --> 01:39:08.920]   if I don't get my haircut in the next three hours,
[01:39:08.920 --> 01:39:10.920]   I will not be able to get a haircut before my dinner
[01:39:10.920 --> 01:39:11.680]   plans tonight.
[01:39:11.680 --> 01:39:13.400]   I have to go-- I know I'm going to get wet.
[01:39:13.400 --> 01:39:14.440]   I'm OK with getting wet.
[01:39:14.440 --> 01:39:16.920]   That's much, much better than the consequences of mine
[01:39:16.920 --> 01:39:20.080]   not being able to do this thing that you don't want me to do.
[01:39:20.080 --> 01:39:21.440]   So there's no right answer.
[01:39:21.440 --> 01:39:22.800]   I'm glad--
[01:39:22.800 --> 01:39:24.400]   as always, this is my mantra.
[01:39:24.400 --> 01:39:25.360]   If I have a cut-off--
[01:39:25.360 --> 01:39:26.440]   choices and t-shirts going to have
[01:39:26.440 --> 01:39:29.520]   say that I like it when consumers get
[01:39:29.520 --> 01:39:31.360]   to choose what their solution is.
[01:39:31.360 --> 01:39:33.480]   And for some of them, their best-- their better solution
[01:39:33.480 --> 01:39:34.160]   is going to be iOS.
[01:39:34.160 --> 01:39:36.200]   For some of the bread approach, it's going to be Android.
[01:39:36.200 --> 01:39:36.400]   Yeah.
[01:39:36.400 --> 01:39:38.080]   And it's worth pointing out that for a lot of people,
[01:39:38.080 --> 01:39:39.560]   they have their Tumblr share extension.
[01:39:39.560 --> 01:39:40.720]   They have their BuzzFeed widget.
[01:39:40.720 --> 01:39:42.480]   They have so much things from extensibility
[01:39:42.480 --> 01:39:45.720]   that it doesn't really affect them if drafts or--
[01:39:45.720 --> 01:39:47.440]   it's mostly the kind of people who are on the show
[01:39:47.440 --> 01:39:49.360]   or listen to the show, the kind of people like us
[01:39:49.360 --> 01:39:50.640]   who aspire to more.
[01:39:50.640 --> 01:39:52.080]   And I'm actually--
[01:39:52.080 --> 01:39:54.880]   iOS-- I was talking about this with Christina Warren last night.
[01:39:54.880 --> 01:39:56.640]   You see custom keyboards in iOS now.
[01:39:56.640 --> 01:39:58.080]   If those weren't extremely popular in Android,
[01:39:58.080 --> 01:39:59.040]   maybe we wouldn't.
[01:39:59.040 --> 01:40:00.880]   So if we see tons of applications that
[01:40:00.880 --> 01:40:04.120]   are just groundbreaking stellar that are moving Android devices,
[01:40:04.120 --> 01:40:05.680]   maybe that'll affect change at Apple.
[01:40:05.680 --> 01:40:07.840]   But right now, there are certain people, I think,
[01:40:07.840 --> 01:40:10.360]   who believe that if you hit that button,
[01:40:10.360 --> 01:40:12.240]   they don't want someone to switch apps because it'll
[01:40:12.240 --> 01:40:14.120]   confuse and it'll take them somewhere they're not used to.
[01:40:14.120 --> 01:40:16.800]   Someone could use it to try to sell them an app.
[01:40:16.800 --> 01:40:18.560]   And they're winning some of these fights.
[01:40:18.560 --> 01:40:21.320]   And it's an argument as to whether or not that's
[01:40:21.320 --> 01:40:23.400]   a good decision, but that argument is happening so late
[01:40:23.400 --> 01:40:27.240]   in the cycle that it's affecting a lot of developers' work.
[01:40:27.240 --> 01:40:30.880]   I just-- it's such a wrong-headed way to do this.
[01:40:30.880 --> 01:40:34.840]   And it's-- it does make Apple look like they don't
[01:40:34.840 --> 01:40:35.880]   have their crap together.
[01:40:35.880 --> 01:40:37.280]   And that's something they did.
[01:40:37.280 --> 01:40:39.840]   For no other reason, they need to be able to say,
[01:40:39.840 --> 01:40:43.800]   we know what we're going to say in a clear message.
[01:40:43.800 --> 01:40:46.280]   One department of Apple knows what
[01:40:46.280 --> 01:40:48.080]   another department is doing and they're
[01:40:48.080 --> 01:40:49.040]   working together.
[01:40:49.040 --> 01:40:52.720]   This is the reason why, like at HP and like at Microsoft
[01:40:52.720 --> 01:40:54.920]   in the old days, they would make stuff where we made a printer
[01:40:54.920 --> 01:40:57.000]   that the operating system does not support yet.
[01:40:57.000 --> 01:40:59.680]   Or we have a note book that basically
[01:40:59.680 --> 01:41:02.280]   does not-- can't work with fit inside this other accessory
[01:41:02.280 --> 01:41:04.160]   that we made just six months earlier.
[01:41:04.160 --> 01:41:05.920]   And this is why we were releasing a product and then
[01:41:05.920 --> 01:41:07.640]   canceling it 30 days later.
[01:41:07.640 --> 01:41:09.800]   That is a society in chaos.
[01:41:09.800 --> 01:41:11.600]   Apple has always been very, very proud,
[01:41:11.600 --> 01:41:14.800]   justly so, of the idea that we have a plan for everything,
[01:41:14.800 --> 01:41:15.960]   not everything that we make--
[01:41:15.960 --> 01:41:18.160]   we make cells-- excuse me-- is successful.
[01:41:18.160 --> 01:41:20.240]   But even when we made the iPod HiFi,
[01:41:20.240 --> 01:41:24.240]   we had other products that were perfectly suited for it
[01:41:24.240 --> 01:41:27.480]   and a world in which it could succeed.
[01:41:27.480 --> 01:41:30.760]   I did a piece last week where I was basically just
[01:41:30.760 --> 01:41:33.600]   ruminating what if Apple had a high profile, very public
[01:41:33.600 --> 01:41:35.280]   facing VP of App Store?
[01:41:35.280 --> 01:41:37.000]   Because Tim Cook famously put all software
[01:41:37.000 --> 01:41:39.360]   under Craig Federighi, all design under Johnny Ive.
[01:41:39.360 --> 01:41:40.400]   And that's had great effect.
[01:41:40.400 --> 01:41:43.840]   They put online and retail under Angela Aaron's.
[01:41:43.840 --> 01:41:45.640]   And that's producing really good effects too.
[01:41:45.640 --> 01:41:47.880]   So what if they took the parts of the App Store that
[01:41:47.880 --> 01:41:49.360]   were under Eddy Q, that were under Phil Schiller,
[01:41:49.360 --> 01:41:52.040]   and had a very public facing vice president of App Store,
[01:41:52.040 --> 01:41:54.160]   whose only job was to make the App Store delightful
[01:41:54.160 --> 01:41:56.760]   for customers and for developers, to fix review,
[01:41:56.760 --> 01:41:59.560]   to fix search, to fix all these things that all of us
[01:41:59.560 --> 01:42:00.880]   have been complaining about for years.
[01:42:00.880 --> 01:42:03.920]   I think that would be a super interesting position to Apple.
[01:42:03.920 --> 01:42:06.280]   That'd be an interesting move, but he would have to have
[01:42:06.280 --> 01:42:08.160]   a cricket bat and the power to use it.
[01:42:08.160 --> 01:42:08.920]   It's not going to--
[01:42:08.920 --> 01:42:10.000]   Give it to my guys.
[01:42:10.000 --> 01:42:11.400]   Give it to my guys.
[01:42:11.400 --> 01:42:12.520]   You're fantasizing.
[01:42:12.520 --> 01:42:13.720]   This is not going to happen.
[01:42:13.720 --> 01:42:15.440]   I've done it with other things.
[01:42:15.440 --> 01:42:16.240]   OK.
[01:42:16.240 --> 01:42:17.080]   I'm saying this is a good--
[01:42:17.080 --> 01:42:18.280]   I think it's a cultural issue.
[01:42:18.280 --> 01:42:20.960]   I think it's absolutely a mindset.
[01:42:20.960 --> 01:42:22.040]   It's like saying--
[01:42:22.040 --> 01:42:23.840]   I mean, it's a centrally planned economy.
[01:42:23.840 --> 01:42:25.520]   It's going to stay a centrally planned economy.
[01:42:25.520 --> 01:42:27.320]   That's fundamental to Apple.
[01:42:27.320 --> 01:42:28.680]   And there's definitely advantages.
[01:42:28.680 --> 01:42:29.720]   I'm not saying there aren't.
[01:42:29.720 --> 01:42:31.720]   You could have that without the mixed messages.
[01:42:31.720 --> 01:42:32.400]   Well, that--
[01:42:32.400 --> 01:42:33.840]   This is a screw up.
[01:42:33.840 --> 01:42:34.440]   Absolutely.
[01:42:34.440 --> 01:42:35.640]   But I think it's just what happened.
[01:42:35.640 --> 01:42:37.000]   You've painted yourself into a corner.
[01:42:37.000 --> 01:42:39.360]   It's what happens when you set yourself up as an arbiter of what
[01:42:39.360 --> 01:42:41.360]   can and cannot happen on the platform.
[01:42:41.360 --> 01:42:42.400]   You're going to be the arbiter.
[01:42:42.400 --> 01:42:45.560]   And it's going to be arbitrary from time to time.
[01:42:45.560 --> 01:42:46.960]   And developers just have to live with that.
[01:42:46.960 --> 01:42:50.480]   They do because they want to be on the Apple platform.
[01:42:50.480 --> 01:42:51.200]   I wonder, though.
[01:42:51.200 --> 01:42:53.200]   I mean, I think in the long run, doesn't this hurt your developer
[01:42:53.200 --> 01:42:53.760]   relations?
[01:42:53.760 --> 01:42:56.040]   For Candy Crush soda, does it make a difference for them?
[01:42:56.040 --> 01:42:57.200]   Yeah, it doesn't give you the no.
[01:42:57.200 --> 01:42:59.720]   Developer relations substance has never been really great.
[01:42:59.720 --> 01:43:02.960]   It's always been here is where the pile of money is.
[01:43:02.960 --> 01:43:05.440]   Or perhaps more to the point, here
[01:43:05.440 --> 01:43:07.520]   is where the large audience is.
[01:43:07.520 --> 01:43:09.600]   You either want to be in front of that large audience,
[01:43:09.600 --> 01:43:13.480]   in which case you will win.
[01:43:13.480 --> 01:43:21.240]   You can either be Craig Ferguson or you can be Jimmy Fallon.
[01:43:21.240 --> 01:43:23.240]   If you want to be Jimmy Fallon, then you're
[01:43:23.240 --> 01:43:25.280]   going to have to submit to a whole bunch of rules
[01:43:25.280 --> 01:43:29.040]   and make it very inconvenient to do exactly what you want to do.
[01:43:29.040 --> 01:43:33.160]   If you want to be the 1230 guy who has a smaller audience,
[01:43:33.160 --> 01:43:34.880]   you can have a robots skeleton sidekick.
[01:43:34.880 --> 01:43:37.240]   You can have two guys on a horse costume.
[01:43:37.240 --> 01:43:38.680]   You can do whatever you want.
[01:43:38.680 --> 01:43:40.560]   I mean, there are a lot of people in developer relations
[01:43:40.560 --> 01:43:42.960]   who care really deeply about this stuff, too.
[01:43:42.960 --> 01:43:44.720]   It's not a hive minder.
[01:43:44.720 --> 01:43:46.600]   And no one's suggesting there isn't.
[01:43:46.600 --> 01:43:49.640]   Again, all I'm concerned about is number one.
[01:43:49.640 --> 01:43:53.040]   I just think that whatever they choose to--
[01:43:53.040 --> 01:43:56.800]   whatever face they choose to present to the outside world,
[01:43:56.800 --> 01:44:00.520]   Apple is more than capable of getting that act together.
[01:44:00.520 --> 01:44:02.640]   For other companies, that would be an unsolvable problem.
[01:44:02.640 --> 01:44:04.080]   It would require a huge restructuring,
[01:44:04.080 --> 01:44:06.240]   or they wouldn't have the resources or the talent.
[01:44:06.240 --> 01:44:07.600]   Apple has all of those things.
[01:44:07.600 --> 01:44:09.440]   It's because they really haven't decided
[01:44:09.440 --> 01:44:12.000]   that the problem is big enough yet.
[01:44:12.000 --> 01:44:13.920]   When I'm in beard stroking mode, I wonder
[01:44:13.920 --> 01:44:18.440]   if at some point developers will get so fed up that they'll
[01:44:18.440 --> 01:44:21.080]   say the audience is no longer big enough for me
[01:44:21.080 --> 01:44:22.720]   to think it's worthwhile.
[01:44:22.720 --> 01:44:27.240]   The advantages of the Xcode environment are also not big enough
[01:44:27.240 --> 01:44:29.880]   for me to want to deal with all the headaches of dealing
[01:44:29.880 --> 01:44:31.440]   with Apple developing.
[01:44:31.440 --> 01:44:32.840]   I'm going to move to Android.
[01:44:32.840 --> 01:44:34.200]   I'm going to move to other platforms.
[01:44:34.200 --> 01:44:37.920]   And this is not a prediction, and this is not even
[01:44:37.920 --> 01:44:39.640]   a real front of my mind worry.
[01:44:39.640 --> 01:44:43.200]   But boy, you've heard me use this phrase before.
[01:44:43.200 --> 01:44:47.040]   Sometimes I think about a company that is no longer as
[01:44:47.040 --> 01:44:49.720]   powerful as it used to be 10 years ago.
[01:44:49.720 --> 01:44:52.200]   And then you, at that point, which they're all failing,
[01:44:52.200 --> 01:44:55.560]   you think back to, can we identify problems 10 years ago
[01:44:55.560 --> 01:44:57.720]   that have led to a state right now?
[01:44:57.720 --> 01:45:00.040]   I feel as though, if that were to happen to Apple 10 years
[01:45:00.040 --> 01:45:02.320]   from now, we'd say, yes.
[01:45:02.320 --> 01:45:03.200]   They overstated.
[01:45:03.200 --> 01:45:05.840]   They over considered the value that people would attach
[01:45:05.840 --> 01:45:08.280]   to developing software just for their platform.
[01:45:08.280 --> 01:45:11.080]   And at some point, they put so much pressure on users
[01:45:11.080 --> 01:45:14.400]   or developers that those just basically holding an egg,
[01:45:14.400 --> 01:45:15.560]   they crushed both of them.
[01:45:15.560 --> 01:45:17.840]   Real quickly, because we're way over time,
[01:45:17.840 --> 01:45:21.400]   new Apple TV download today, new firmware.
[01:45:21.400 --> 01:45:23.720]   What's new Renee?
[01:45:23.720 --> 01:45:26.560]   YouTube app now has ads, which means that Apple--
[01:45:26.560 --> 01:45:29.040]   YouTube is all under restricting what videos go
[01:45:29.040 --> 01:45:29.640]   to the Apple TV.
[01:45:29.640 --> 01:45:31.600]   Usually they wouldn't send videos that had ads attached.
[01:45:31.600 --> 01:45:32.440]   Now, because there's ads--
[01:45:32.440 --> 01:45:34.720]   At least that this means if Google wouldn't have updated
[01:45:34.720 --> 01:45:36.720]   their YouTube app so significantly,
[01:45:36.720 --> 01:45:39.240]   it actually now matches the other platforms.
[01:45:39.240 --> 01:45:41.960]   If they thought that Apple was going to change Apple TV soon--
[01:45:41.960 --> 01:45:43.360]   I don't think it means anything else.
[01:45:43.360 --> 01:45:44.360]   Anything else.
[01:45:44.360 --> 01:45:45.000]   OK.
[01:45:45.000 --> 01:45:45.880]   Just asking.
[01:45:45.880 --> 01:45:47.480]   You also have the UFC channel.
[01:45:47.480 --> 01:45:48.520]   You have Fusion.
[01:45:48.520 --> 01:45:50.480]   And there was a couple other channels.
[01:45:50.480 --> 01:45:51.720]   So you can get all your mixed martial arts
[01:45:51.720 --> 01:45:54.480]   right delivered to your TV.
[01:45:54.480 --> 01:45:56.000]   OK.
[01:45:56.000 --> 01:45:58.080]   It's starting to get really creaky.
[01:45:58.080 --> 01:45:59.480]   There's a daily-- what's that?
[01:45:59.480 --> 01:46:00.920]   The other video service, Daily Motion?
[01:46:00.920 --> 01:46:01.240]   I think it's--
[01:46:01.240 --> 01:46:02.120]   Daily Motion's on there.
[01:46:02.120 --> 01:46:03.120]   Yeah.
[01:46:03.120 --> 01:46:06.720]   It's creaky because only Apple can add apps to the Apple TV.
[01:46:06.720 --> 01:46:08.680]   And now this grid is getting bigger and bigger and bigger
[01:46:08.680 --> 01:46:09.760]   and longer and longer and longer.
[01:46:09.760 --> 01:46:11.080]   And it's just--
[01:46:11.080 --> 01:46:14.000]   Almost like they should have a new version of your development.
[01:46:14.000 --> 01:46:15.240]   There's gotta be.
[01:46:15.240 --> 01:46:17.280]   There's gotta be.
[01:46:17.280 --> 01:46:19.560]   Again, if you are familiar with the people involved
[01:46:19.560 --> 01:46:21.000]   in Apple TV development, you know that they're
[01:46:21.000 --> 01:46:22.200]   an all-star lineup right now.
[01:46:22.200 --> 01:46:23.960]   And it probably would be the case if they weren't working on
[01:46:23.960 --> 01:46:24.240]   some stuff.
[01:46:24.240 --> 01:46:24.440]   Yeah.
[01:46:24.440 --> 01:46:25.720]   See, that's what you look at, right?
[01:46:25.720 --> 01:46:27.160]   Who's working there?
[01:46:27.160 --> 01:46:29.840]   If Apple's putting resources behind it, then you know.
[01:46:29.840 --> 01:46:31.560]   And I'm looking forward to this dash language.
[01:46:31.560 --> 01:46:34.000]   I don't use-- I use LastPass, but I am now thinking about moving
[01:46:34.000 --> 01:46:36.320]   to Dashlane if you're using one password, LastPass,
[01:46:36.320 --> 01:46:37.760]   or some other password manager.
[01:46:37.760 --> 01:46:39.480]   Because they are going to add a feature.
[01:46:39.480 --> 01:46:41.640]   It's in beta right now where you press one button
[01:46:41.640 --> 01:46:45.240]   and it changes all your passwords for 75 of the biggest sites.
[01:46:45.240 --> 01:46:48.800]   It even includes second factor authentication sites.
[01:46:48.800 --> 01:46:51.080]   So I think that's a great idea.
[01:46:51.080 --> 01:46:54.600]   Every password-- maybe every password manager will say, oh,
[01:46:54.600 --> 01:46:55.560]   we should do that.
[01:46:55.560 --> 01:46:56.160]   Yeah.
[01:46:56.160 --> 01:46:57.760]   One password at Watchtower, which is really cool,
[01:46:57.760 --> 01:46:59.280]   because it would tell you where you had duplicate passwords
[01:46:59.280 --> 01:46:59.880]   and help you change it.
[01:46:59.880 --> 01:47:01.760]   LastPass, that's at two.
[01:47:01.760 --> 01:47:04.400]   Yeah, but they still have to go onesie-too-zie to each site
[01:47:04.400 --> 01:47:05.280]   and change it.
[01:47:05.280 --> 01:47:07.560]   If I could push one, apparently, Dashlane acquired
[01:47:07.560 --> 01:47:08.440]   a company that did this.
[01:47:08.440 --> 01:47:10.680]   So maybe they will be the exclusive on this.
[01:47:10.680 --> 01:47:12.400]   I do know a lot of people use Dashlane.
[01:47:12.400 --> 01:47:16.640]   It's very Mac-ish, very pretty, very nicely done.
[01:47:16.640 --> 01:47:17.280]   Anyway, just a thought.
[01:47:17.280 --> 01:47:18.600]   Just use something, please.
[01:47:18.600 --> 01:47:19.520]   Yeah, please.
[01:47:19.520 --> 01:47:22.520]   Whatever you do, use something.
[01:47:22.520 --> 01:47:26.280]   A break ahead coming up, your picks of the week,
[01:47:26.280 --> 01:47:29.680]   including a new game from Buzz Aldrin that just came out.
[01:47:29.680 --> 01:47:31.120]   Talking about space.
[01:47:31.120 --> 01:47:33.120]   Was that the one you were going to talk about, Andy?
[01:47:33.120 --> 01:47:33.560]   No.
[01:47:33.560 --> 01:47:34.680]   OK.
[01:47:34.680 --> 01:47:36.600]   I haven't played with it yet, but I just
[01:47:36.600 --> 01:47:38.240]   observed that it is out.
[01:47:38.240 --> 01:47:40.720]   Our show today brought to you by Audible the place
[01:47:40.720 --> 01:47:41.880]   to go for audio books.
[01:47:41.880 --> 01:47:46.760]   I used to have this really good rule for myself,
[01:47:46.760 --> 01:47:48.720]   that I would only listen to one audiobook at a time.
[01:47:48.720 --> 01:47:50.480]   If you look at my bedside table, there's
[01:47:50.480 --> 01:47:53.440]   12 books that I have physical books I'm in the middle of.
[01:47:53.440 --> 01:47:54.280]   But I always had the rule.
[01:47:54.280 --> 01:47:56.800]   I will listen from beginning to end one audiobook at a time.
[01:47:56.800 --> 01:47:58.720]   That rule completely gone to hell.
[01:47:58.720 --> 01:48:00.800]   I am now listening to five different books at the same time.
[01:48:00.800 --> 01:48:02.840]   And I love every one of them.
[01:48:02.840 --> 01:48:09.840]   I'm really enjoying the variety and quality of Audible books.
[01:48:09.840 --> 01:48:12.880]   If you have not yet listened to audiobooks,
[01:48:12.880 --> 01:48:15.840]   there really is no other choice than audible.com.
[01:48:15.840 --> 01:48:18.040]   I invite you to go to audible.com/macbreak
[01:48:18.040 --> 01:48:22.400]   because we're going to get you a free book of your choice today.
[01:48:22.400 --> 01:48:26.280]   But let's ask Andy what he's listening to first.
[01:48:26.280 --> 01:48:27.800]   Easy pick this time.
[01:48:27.800 --> 01:48:31.680]   That's The Art of Asking by Amanda Palmer.
[01:48:31.680 --> 01:48:34.080]   That's a name that a lot of people are familiar with.
[01:48:34.080 --> 01:48:35.000]   She's a musician.
[01:48:35.000 --> 01:48:38.080]   She became-- we were in the news a couple years ago
[01:48:38.080 --> 01:48:40.240]   because she had a really successful Kickstarter
[01:48:40.240 --> 01:48:44.160]   to fund and pre-sell her next album.
[01:48:44.160 --> 01:48:47.240]   And then she turned the experience
[01:48:47.240 --> 01:48:52.480]   and the idea of becoming an artist who--
[01:48:52.480 --> 01:48:56.720]   it's-- she did a TED talk that got several million hits.
[01:48:56.720 --> 01:48:59.280]   Very, very beautiful put together about the connection
[01:48:59.280 --> 01:49:03.120]   between the artist and the community that supports them
[01:49:03.120 --> 01:49:08.400]   and how it's OK to be a little bit more open about how--
[01:49:08.400 --> 01:49:10.000]   I want to do the next album.
[01:49:10.000 --> 01:49:11.440]   If you buy it in-- don't--
[01:49:11.440 --> 01:49:13.200]   I don't want necessarily free money to do it.
[01:49:13.200 --> 01:49:15.240]   But if you buy it in advance, that will give me the funds
[01:49:15.240 --> 01:49:16.800]   to get the studio time.
[01:49:16.800 --> 01:49:17.840]   Or I want to do a tour.
[01:49:17.840 --> 01:49:21.720]   If anybody has a spare room that I can stay in, that's great too.
[01:49:21.720 --> 01:49:24.280]   This is sort of that TED talk expanded
[01:49:24.280 --> 01:49:27.080]   into 100,000 word book.
[01:49:27.080 --> 01:49:32.600]   And it reads more like a beautiful blog post, actually.
[01:49:32.600 --> 01:49:34.040]   And I mean that in every positive way,
[01:49:34.040 --> 01:49:37.160]   where it threads-- it's a combination of a memoir
[01:49:37.160 --> 01:49:40.800]   and a talk about the evolution of an artist
[01:49:40.800 --> 01:49:43.720]   and also the evolution of the music industry
[01:49:43.720 --> 01:49:47.880]   and how her personality and her life and her business
[01:49:47.880 --> 01:49:49.400]   and her art kind of melt together.
[01:49:49.400 --> 01:49:50.680]   That's why I call it a blog post.
[01:49:50.680 --> 01:49:52.960]   It's very, very well edited, very well put together.
[01:49:52.960 --> 01:49:54.760]   And the star of the show is the fact
[01:49:54.760 --> 01:49:57.000]   that I really think the best way to do it
[01:49:57.000 --> 01:50:00.120]   is on Audible, not on text, because of course she reads it
[01:50:00.120 --> 01:50:01.360]   herself.
[01:50:01.360 --> 01:50:04.160]   And when you hear someone telling their own story,
[01:50:04.160 --> 01:50:05.880]   it's even more compelling when you're
[01:50:05.880 --> 01:50:08.320]   hearing that story in their own voice spoken.
[01:50:08.320 --> 01:50:11.600]   I think you get a whole bunch of understanding and context
[01:50:11.600 --> 01:50:13.520]   that you don't get when it's words on a page.
[01:50:13.520 --> 01:50:16.360]   Also, she's a musician, so you get to hear her play music
[01:50:16.360 --> 01:50:18.320]   and some tracks from her career.
[01:50:18.320 --> 01:50:22.680]   And so it really is probably one of my top 10 audio books
[01:50:22.680 --> 01:50:25.280]   ever, just such a pleasant experience start to finish.
[01:50:25.280 --> 01:50:28.680]   Amanda Palmer, the art of asking how I learned to stop worrying
[01:50:28.680 --> 01:50:29.920]   and let people out.
[01:50:29.920 --> 01:50:31.240]   You get that for free.
[01:50:31.240 --> 01:50:33.320]   If you're also looking for other recommendations,
[01:50:33.320 --> 01:50:37.120]   I might point you to Audible's new list, the best of 2014,
[01:50:37.120 --> 01:50:39.320]   which has recommendations in many different categories.
[01:50:39.320 --> 01:50:40.760]   I have not even heard of this one,
[01:50:40.760 --> 01:50:43.920]   the audiobook of the year, Hamlet, Prince of Denmark,
[01:50:43.920 --> 01:50:48.520]   a novel, but there are books in every category,
[01:50:48.520 --> 01:50:50.560]   including As You Wish, the Princess Bride book,
[01:50:50.560 --> 01:50:53.160]   which you recommended and I have downloaded,
[01:50:53.160 --> 01:50:54.560]   haven't yet listened to.
[01:50:54.560 --> 01:50:56.160]   Andy, I think I'm going to pick this one.
[01:50:56.160 --> 01:50:59.560]   I have a credit remaining right now.
[01:50:59.560 --> 01:51:02.680]   This is the great courses, Neil deGrasse Tyson,
[01:51:02.680 --> 01:51:04.960]   who is actually a professor.
[01:51:04.960 --> 01:51:08.160]   And this is the course he teaches on the inexplicable universe,
[01:51:08.160 --> 01:51:10.960]   Unsolved Mysteries.
[01:51:10.960 --> 01:51:13.360]   And this is one of the things that's really great about Audible.
[01:51:13.360 --> 01:51:15.480]   They now have the great courses catalog.
[01:51:15.480 --> 01:51:17.080]   So you can get that too.
[01:51:17.080 --> 01:51:18.760]   But here's how you get one free.
[01:51:18.760 --> 01:51:20.120]   Good luck choosing.
[01:51:20.120 --> 01:51:23.920]   One free, merely go to audible.com/macbreak.
[01:51:23.920 --> 01:51:25.520]   Sign up for the gold account.
[01:51:25.520 --> 01:51:27.720]   That means a book a month, every 30 days,
[01:51:27.720 --> 01:51:31.080]   you also get the audio digest of either the New York Times
[01:51:31.080 --> 01:51:33.960]   or the Wall Street Journal as part of your subscription.
[01:51:33.960 --> 01:51:35.520]   You pay nothing in the first 30 days,
[01:51:35.520 --> 01:51:37.400]   cancel any time in the first 30 days,
[01:51:37.400 --> 01:51:39.320]   you'll get to keep the book.
[01:51:39.320 --> 01:51:40.480]   But I don't think you're going to want to.
[01:51:40.480 --> 01:51:43.360]   There's stuff that is so amazing and audible,
[01:51:43.360 --> 01:51:45.800]   150,000 titles.
[01:51:45.800 --> 01:51:48.960]   I wish I had more time in my life to listen to Audible.
[01:51:48.960 --> 01:51:51.240]   It's brought reading back into my life.
[01:51:51.240 --> 01:51:52.840]   And I think it will do the same for you.
[01:51:52.840 --> 01:51:58.640]   audible.com/macbreak.
[01:51:58.640 --> 01:52:00.880]   Andy Inaco, pick of the week.
[01:52:00.880 --> 01:52:03.000]   I got two storage picks this time.
[01:52:03.000 --> 01:52:04.360]   We were talking about Blu-ray Ripper.
[01:52:04.360 --> 01:52:07.480]   So I reached over and I plucked out the Blu-ray drive
[01:52:07.480 --> 01:52:10.040]   that I used to rip discs from.
[01:52:10.040 --> 01:52:11.560]   This is a no name.
[01:52:11.560 --> 01:52:14.560]   It's technically called the e-parts Blu-ray drive.
[01:52:14.560 --> 01:52:16.960]   You can get on Amazon for $40.
[01:52:16.960 --> 01:52:19.880]   There are already people on Twitter saying,
[01:52:19.880 --> 01:52:22.640]   "Which one specifically are you using?"
[01:52:22.640 --> 01:52:24.200]   Because not again, not all of them will work
[01:52:24.200 --> 01:52:25.040]   with a Blu-ray Ripper.
[01:52:25.040 --> 01:52:26.720]   This one works perfectly fine.
[01:52:26.720 --> 01:52:28.280]   Again, it's not spectacular.
[01:52:28.280 --> 01:52:29.040]   This is plastic.
[01:52:29.040 --> 01:52:30.800]   It's not milled aluminum.
[01:52:30.800 --> 01:52:33.040]   But it works perfectly for all my tasks.
[01:52:33.040 --> 01:52:35.480]   And it's just damn dirt cheap.
[01:52:35.480 --> 01:52:37.280]   The second one is also related to,
[01:52:37.280 --> 01:52:38.960]   we're talking about SSDs.
[01:52:38.960 --> 01:52:41.520]   This is my external SSD drive.
[01:52:41.520 --> 01:52:43.800]   It's in a case that I really, really like.
[01:52:43.800 --> 01:52:45.360]   This is again, dirt cheap.
[01:52:45.360 --> 01:52:50.240]   This is a USB 3.0 case that costs less than $20.
[01:52:50.240 --> 01:52:52.400]   But the really good selling point is that
[01:52:52.400 --> 01:52:54.280]   it opens up without any tools.
[01:52:54.280 --> 01:52:56.520]   So what you can do is you can just simply
[01:52:56.520 --> 01:53:00.040]   use your fingers like this, pop the top off,
[01:53:00.040 --> 01:53:03.440]   and then simply swap out whatever SSD
[01:53:03.440 --> 01:53:05.640]   or spinning disk drive you have.
[01:53:05.640 --> 01:53:07.200]   It just lifts right out.
[01:53:07.200 --> 01:53:12.200]   So this is maybe more practical for SSDs than spinning drives,
[01:53:12.200 --> 01:53:14.880]   but it means that given how cheap,
[01:53:14.880 --> 01:53:16.320]   like the lower capacity drives are,
[01:53:16.320 --> 01:53:20.280]   you can have, I can travel with my entire like 250 gigabyte
[01:53:20.280 --> 01:53:25.080]   music collection, and also the 500 gigabytes
[01:53:25.080 --> 01:53:28.520]   that I use for video editing and photo editing.
[01:53:28.520 --> 01:53:31.440]   Without having to just, you know,
[01:53:31.440 --> 01:53:36.320]   pops 700 bucks for the largest terabyte drive I can find,
[01:53:36.320 --> 01:53:38.960]   risk that that one is going to fail.
[01:53:38.960 --> 01:53:41.160]   You can travel easily with a couple of these
[01:53:41.160 --> 01:53:42.120]   and swap things in and out.
[01:53:42.120 --> 01:53:45.240]   Or you can buy even a spinning drive
[01:53:45.240 --> 01:53:47.120]   and swap things in and out.
[01:53:47.120 --> 01:53:49.440]   I would not use it as a floppy
[01:53:49.440 --> 01:53:52.240]   where you're keeping swapping things like five times a day,
[01:53:52.240 --> 01:53:54.960]   because I'm not sure that the mechanism of the SSD
[01:53:54.960 --> 01:53:56.840]   would really, really enjoy you doing that.
[01:53:56.840 --> 01:53:59.600]   But it does mean that it's very, very easy
[01:53:59.600 --> 01:54:01.560]   to have multiple sources of storage,
[01:54:01.560 --> 01:54:03.440]   and then either one of these drives
[01:54:03.440 --> 01:54:05.720]   or even just multiple copies of this enclosure.
[01:54:05.720 --> 01:54:08.240]   Again, it's like less than 20 bucks.
[01:54:08.240 --> 01:54:10.720]   Again, it's not like it's made out of one block
[01:54:10.720 --> 01:54:13.960]   of premium aluminum, but again, it's plastic.
[01:54:13.960 --> 01:54:16.240]   It will last just perfectly fine.
[01:54:16.240 --> 01:54:18.120]   I've been using it for the past couple months
[01:54:18.120 --> 01:54:19.240]   and I'm very glad with that purchase.
[01:54:19.240 --> 01:54:21.520]   These are both things I just bought with my own damn money.
[01:54:21.520 --> 01:54:23.880]   - And one thing that you've got to give them credit for,
[01:54:23.880 --> 01:54:28.880]   the company name Inetech is the same name.
[01:54:28.880 --> 01:54:33.120]   You knew what I was going, where I was going.
[01:54:33.120 --> 01:54:35.480]   Is the same name as the company in office?
[01:54:35.480 --> 01:54:37.000]   - The only thing I could think about
[01:54:37.000 --> 01:54:38.520]   during your entire review ad.
[01:54:38.520 --> 01:54:41.160]   - It's spelled a little differently.
[01:54:41.160 --> 01:54:42.640]   - Yeah, it's a little different.
[01:54:42.640 --> 01:54:44.040]   - It's legal.
[01:54:44.040 --> 01:54:46.480]   - I'm gonna have you come back over the weekend
[01:54:46.480 --> 01:54:48.960]   and finish this hard drive case.
[01:54:48.960 --> 01:54:49.800]   - Okay.
[01:54:49.800 --> 01:54:52.560]   - I love Inetech.
[01:54:52.560 --> 01:54:55.040]   You think they knew when they named that company?
[01:54:55.040 --> 01:54:57.320]   - No, I think that for people who can't afford
[01:54:57.320 --> 01:55:00.000]   a genuine Inetech drive, you wanna get the off-brand.
[01:55:00.000 --> 01:55:01.440]   (laughing)
[01:55:01.440 --> 01:55:02.640]   - I love it.
[01:55:02.640 --> 01:55:05.120]   Renee Richie, something was going on backstage there.
[01:55:05.120 --> 01:55:06.280]   I don't know what he's been up to.
[01:55:06.280 --> 01:55:08.560]   I gave you a few extra seconds so you could
[01:55:08.560 --> 01:55:10.680]   prepare your pick of the week.
[01:55:10.680 --> 01:55:13.160]   - Oh, I was just moving the giant gray curtain of doom away.
[01:55:13.160 --> 01:55:14.400]   It was starting to fall on me,
[01:55:14.400 --> 01:55:15.920]   so I tried to move it to the other side.
[01:55:15.920 --> 01:55:16.760]   - Okay.
[01:55:16.760 --> 01:55:18.280]   (laughing)
[01:55:18.280 --> 01:55:19.320]   - What's up?
[01:55:19.320 --> 01:55:21.000]   - So my pick of the week is in honor of the discussion
[01:55:21.000 --> 01:55:21.960]   we just had with Andy.
[01:55:21.960 --> 01:55:23.040]   It's one of my favorite apps.
[01:55:23.040 --> 01:55:24.560]   I'm pretty sure I've picked it before,
[01:55:24.560 --> 01:55:25.560]   but I use it all the time.
[01:55:25.560 --> 01:55:27.520]   It's called AirVideoHD.
[01:55:27.520 --> 01:55:29.320]   And it does one job really, really well.
[01:55:29.320 --> 01:55:31.680]   You run a small app on your Mac
[01:55:31.680 --> 01:55:34.000]   and you tell it what directories you want it to look in.
[01:55:34.000 --> 01:55:36.120]   And from that point, you can stream any video
[01:55:36.120 --> 01:55:38.360]   on those directories directly to your iPad,
[01:55:38.360 --> 01:55:39.760]   directly to your iPhone,
[01:55:39.760 --> 01:55:41.520]   and even better press the AirPlay button
[01:55:41.520 --> 01:55:43.600]   and send them directly to your Apple TV.
[01:55:43.600 --> 01:55:46.320]   So there's a lot of times when I am admittedly too lazy
[01:55:46.320 --> 01:55:48.320]   to get up and go get the Blu-ray,
[01:55:48.320 --> 01:55:50.880]   or I've bought a version of the movie on iTunes.
[01:55:50.880 --> 01:55:53.000]   It doesn't include the features I want to watch
[01:55:53.000 --> 01:55:55.360]   because the special features aren't always the same.
[01:55:55.360 --> 01:55:57.800]   And this way, if I happen to have it living on my server,
[01:55:57.800 --> 01:56:01.680]   or if I have a home movies or anything else that's on my Mac,
[01:56:01.680 --> 01:56:03.200]   I can just with a couple of clicks,
[01:56:03.200 --> 01:56:05.160]   sorry, a couple of taps, get that video,
[01:56:05.160 --> 01:56:07.680]   load it into the app, watch it on my iPhone,
[01:56:07.680 --> 01:56:09.040]   watch it on my iPad,
[01:56:09.040 --> 01:56:11.880]   or AirPlay it directly to my Apple TV.
[01:56:11.880 --> 01:56:13.920]   It just does that job fantastically well.
[01:56:13.920 --> 01:56:15.960]   And they keep improving it.
[01:56:15.960 --> 01:56:16.800]   - Awesome.
[01:56:16.800 --> 01:56:21.440]   I just, this just came out and I'm not gonna review it
[01:56:21.440 --> 01:56:22.280]   'cause I haven't tried it.
[01:56:22.280 --> 01:56:24.000]   It comes from Slytherin.
[01:56:24.000 --> 01:56:25.320]   Slytherin games.
[01:56:25.320 --> 01:56:30.800]   Buzz Aldrin's Space Program Manager,
[01:56:30.800 --> 01:56:33.760]   Road to the Moon, the Ultimate Game of Space Exploration.
[01:56:33.760 --> 01:56:35.000]   I don't know anything about this,
[01:56:35.000 --> 01:56:36.040]   but I'm pointing it out.
[01:56:36.040 --> 01:56:39.480]   You have to buy it, but it's also available on Steam,
[01:56:39.480 --> 01:56:42.000]   $29.99, it is available for Mac.
[01:56:42.000 --> 01:56:46.160]   And it looks cool, looks cool, read about it.
[01:56:46.160 --> 01:56:47.720]   I don't know anything about it,
[01:56:47.720 --> 01:56:49.520]   but the fact that it came from the second person
[01:56:49.520 --> 01:56:50.960]   to walk on the face of the moon
[01:56:50.960 --> 01:56:53.160]   gives a little bit of credibility.
[01:56:53.160 --> 01:56:56.800]   - Once again proving that if you can say,
[01:56:56.800 --> 01:56:59.360]   "Hey, I walked on the moon."
[01:56:59.360 --> 01:57:00.200]   - You can do it.
[01:57:00.200 --> 01:57:02.560]   - You'll win any argument.
[01:57:02.560 --> 01:57:05.040]   - When I was on the moon, I said.
[01:57:05.040 --> 01:57:06.040]   - Yeah, exactly.
[01:57:06.040 --> 01:57:08.480]   - We are ordering the poo poo platter for eight.
[01:57:08.480 --> 01:57:10.280]   We're not ordering separate entrees.
[01:57:10.280 --> 01:57:11.480]   - All right, you're right.
[01:57:11.480 --> 01:57:13.040]   - You're right on the moon.
[01:57:13.040 --> 01:57:14.600]   - We love you, Buzz.
[01:57:14.600 --> 01:57:15.560]   Yeah, anyway, this looks interesting.
[01:57:15.560 --> 01:57:17.240]   It's a simulator of some kind,
[01:57:17.240 --> 01:57:20.240]   but it's not like flying.
[01:57:20.240 --> 01:57:23.400]   You have to actually plan the space,
[01:57:23.400 --> 01:57:26.920]   or you have funds and you have to plan your space race.
[01:57:26.920 --> 01:57:29.400]   So that's kinda cool.
[01:57:29.400 --> 01:57:31.000]   I don't think that's the Orion, unfortunately.
[01:57:31.000 --> 01:57:32.440]   It looks like the Winter module.
[01:57:32.440 --> 01:57:34.200]   - That is, yeah, land that on the land,
[01:57:34.200 --> 01:57:37.000]   the land that you can drive around in the rover.
[01:57:37.000 --> 01:57:38.680]   - So much better than Mario Kart.
[01:57:38.680 --> 01:57:41.080]   (laughing)
[01:57:41.080 --> 01:57:45.200]   - Our show has come to a grinding halt,
[01:57:45.200 --> 01:57:47.320]   but thank you so much for being here.
[01:57:47.320 --> 01:57:48.440]   Security now running a little late,
[01:57:48.440 --> 01:57:49.800]   so we're gonna get right to it.
[01:57:49.800 --> 01:57:52.800]   So Mr. Andy and Ico, thank you for your contribution.
[01:57:52.800 --> 01:57:55.400]   As always today, Chicago Sun Times,
[01:57:55.400 --> 01:57:57.320]   the celestial waste of bandwidth,
[01:57:57.320 --> 01:58:01.440]   and two cows looking to jump over the moon.
[01:58:01.440 --> 01:58:02.280]   There you go.
[01:58:02.280 --> 01:58:03.120]   It looks pretty sharp there.
[01:58:03.120 --> 01:58:03.960]   - It looks pretty sharp there.
[01:58:03.960 --> 01:58:05.440]   I don't sure I wanna jump over that.
[01:58:05.440 --> 01:58:09.040]   - We thank Renee Ritchie from iMourne.com.
[01:58:09.040 --> 01:58:12.280]   Also, always really wonderful.
[01:58:12.280 --> 01:58:14.280]   Congratulations to the show, we appreciate it.
[01:58:14.280 --> 01:58:15.120]   Thanks for being here.
[01:58:15.120 --> 01:58:17.680]   You'll find Mac Break Weekly every Tuesday morning,
[01:58:17.680 --> 01:58:19.800]   11 a.m. Pacific, 2 p.m. Eastern Time,
[01:58:19.800 --> 01:58:21.760]   1900 UTC on twit.tv.
[01:58:21.760 --> 01:58:23.920]   Do watch live, we appreciate when you're in the chat room.
[01:58:23.920 --> 01:58:25.080]   You can even join us in the studio.
[01:58:25.080 --> 01:58:27.240]   We've had a fairly large studio audience today.
[01:58:27.240 --> 01:58:28.200]   - Come and go.
[01:58:29.600 --> 01:58:32.400]   - But they had to run.
[01:58:32.400 --> 01:58:33.240]   That's okay.
[01:58:33.240 --> 01:58:34.280]   Are they gonna come back later?
[01:58:34.280 --> 01:58:35.120]   Okay.
[01:58:35.120 --> 01:58:37.120]   You can email tickets at twit.tv
[01:58:37.120 --> 01:58:38.280]   if you'd like to be here in studio.
[01:58:38.280 --> 01:58:39.720]   Well, we'd appreciate that.
[01:58:39.720 --> 01:58:41.360]   So we can put a chair out for you.
[01:58:41.360 --> 01:58:44.160]   We also invite you to give us some help.
[01:58:44.160 --> 01:58:46.320]   Are we still looking for best-ups?
[01:58:46.320 --> 01:58:48.280]   - At this point, I think for Mac Break,
[01:58:48.280 --> 01:58:49.720]   I think we're all good.
[01:58:49.720 --> 01:58:51.920]   - I mean, I'll take whatever.
[01:58:51.920 --> 01:58:53.280]   - Well, you wanna help us.
[01:58:53.280 --> 01:58:54.640]   - People want that TV-slash-best-up,
[01:58:54.640 --> 01:58:56.600]   but we've found enough to fit along.
[01:58:56.600 --> 01:58:57.840]   - But you know what, we're doing best-ups
[01:58:57.840 --> 01:58:58.680]   for all of our shows.
[01:58:58.680 --> 01:59:00.720]   So any help is appreciated.
[01:59:00.720 --> 01:59:02.480]   - Jason's doing most of them.
[01:59:02.480 --> 01:59:05.280]   It's for holiday week, Christmas is what Wednesday.
[01:59:05.280 --> 01:59:07.000]   And so we're gonna take that whole week off.
[01:59:07.000 --> 01:59:09.360]   And most of our shows will have special editions
[01:59:09.360 --> 01:59:10.960]   or best-ups all through the week.
[01:59:10.960 --> 01:59:12.760]   There will be new content for everybody to watch.
[01:59:12.760 --> 01:59:14.400]   So please do.
[01:59:14.400 --> 01:59:16.520]   Don't forget New Year's Eve, we'll be back.
[01:59:16.520 --> 01:59:20.400]   We're gonna have our special 24 hours of 2015,
[01:59:20.400 --> 01:59:22.880]   a benefit for UNICEF,
[01:59:22.880 --> 01:59:25.240]   which is doing great work in Africa
[01:59:25.240 --> 01:59:27.200]   to help children with Ebola.
[01:59:27.200 --> 01:59:30.040]   And it's one of the greatest charities ever.
[01:59:30.040 --> 01:59:31.960]   And we hope to raise a lot of money with your help.
[01:59:31.960 --> 01:59:33.200]   And we're gonna have a lot of fun.
[01:59:33.200 --> 01:59:37.080]   And we want you to watch live 3 AM Pacific on New Year's Eve
[01:59:37.080 --> 01:59:40.320]   to 3 AM Pacific on New Year's Day.
[01:59:40.320 --> 01:59:42.840]   We will also, and the reason we started doing this last year
[01:59:42.840 --> 01:59:45.600]   is 'cause we wanted to celebrate New Year with you
[01:59:45.600 --> 01:59:46.880]   all over the globe.
[01:59:46.880 --> 01:59:48.960]   And there are 27 different time zones.
[01:59:48.960 --> 01:59:52.720]   And believe it or not, this is the map of time zones.
[01:59:52.720 --> 01:59:54.760]   We have people who are gonna be calling in
[01:59:54.760 --> 01:59:59.080]   from the vast majority of time zones.
[01:59:59.080 --> 02:00:00.640]   And we'll be doing the countdown
[02:00:00.640 --> 02:00:02.840]   and the balloon drop each hour.
[02:00:02.840 --> 02:00:04.080]   But we are looking for some.
[02:00:04.080 --> 02:00:07.280]   And if you are in this area, you know somebody who is,
[02:00:07.280 --> 02:00:09.480]   I want you to go to twit.tv/nye.
[02:00:09.480 --> 02:00:12.200]   Fiji, Tuvalu, Marshall Islands.
[02:00:12.200 --> 02:00:15.200]   Actually, we should just say the UTC is plus 12.
[02:00:15.200 --> 02:00:17.960]   Plus 1130 is Norfolk Island.
[02:00:17.960 --> 02:00:21.440]   Plus seven is Thailand, Cambodia, Vietnam, Jakarta.
[02:00:21.440 --> 02:00:23.560]   Burma plus 630.
[02:00:23.560 --> 02:00:27.360]   Bangladesh, Kazakhstan plus six.
[02:00:27.360 --> 02:00:30.960]   Plus five, Yubekistan, Turkmenistan and Pakistan.
[02:00:30.960 --> 02:00:34.800]   Anybody in the plus five area, though, we would welcome you.
[02:00:34.800 --> 02:00:36.720]   I don't know why we don't have somebody from Alaska yet.
[02:00:36.720 --> 02:00:39.840]   Minus nine, GMT minus nine.
[02:00:39.840 --> 02:00:43.560]   If you're in Alaska, twit.tv/nye.
[02:00:43.560 --> 02:00:48.640]   And the one that's gonna be hard, Jarvis Island,
[02:00:48.640 --> 02:00:52.040]   is the last to welcome 2015.
[02:00:52.040 --> 02:00:54.600]   They are minus 11, UTC minus 11.
[02:00:54.600 --> 02:00:58.000]   It's in the US Samoa.
[02:00:58.000 --> 02:00:59.520]   I think it's a bird preserve.
[02:00:59.520 --> 02:01:01.160]   I don't think anybody lives there.
[02:01:01.160 --> 02:01:02.640]   But if you're in Jarvis Island,
[02:01:02.640 --> 02:01:05.000]   actually if you're in Midway, you could do it too.
[02:01:05.000 --> 02:01:08.720]   But just go to our website twit.tv/nye.
[02:01:08.720 --> 02:01:10.600]   We are really looking good.
[02:01:10.600 --> 02:01:11.800]   We are really looking good.
[02:01:11.800 --> 02:01:13.560]   I, we've got people from Afghanistan,
[02:01:13.560 --> 02:01:16.200]   from Moscow, from Finland, from Bermuda,
[02:01:16.200 --> 02:01:18.560]   from New York, of course, Chicago.
[02:01:18.560 --> 02:01:21.200]   Sydney, it's gonna be really fun.
[02:01:21.200 --> 02:01:22.040]   Really, really fun.
[02:01:22.040 --> 02:01:22.880]   That's the New Year's Eve.
[02:01:22.880 --> 02:01:24.520]   I hope you'll come by and watch.
[02:01:24.520 --> 02:01:26.040]   That'll be a lot of fun too.
[02:01:26.040 --> 02:01:29.200]   Is that all we have to plug?
[02:01:29.200 --> 02:01:30.160]   I think it is.
[02:01:30.160 --> 02:01:35.160]   I think we can now say safely without any contradiction.
[02:01:35.160 --> 02:01:36.360]   It's time to get back to work.
[02:01:36.360 --> 02:01:38.640]   'Cause break time is over.
[02:01:38.640 --> 02:01:41.220]   (upbeat music)
[02:01:41.220 --> 02:01:43.800]   (upbeat music)
[02:01:43.800 --> 02:01:46.380]   (upbeat music)
[02:01:46.380 --> 02:01:48.460]   you
