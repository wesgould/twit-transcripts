[00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:40.900]   Every week we cover the Mac Break.
[00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:44.900]   Joining us right now, Alex Lindsay from The Fortress of Lindsay Land.
[00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:48.900]   All we know about it is it's covered in soundproof material.
[00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:49.900]   Hello, Alex.
[00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:53.900]   Isn't that the way everyone, you know, it's actually, they told me it was soundproof.
[00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:57.900]   With a little bit more research, I found that it was just soft padding.
[00:01:57.900 --> 00:01:59.900]   They chose not to get white.
[00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:04.900]   Alex, depending on the wall, it's there for soundproofing.
[00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:06.900]   That's what they told me.
[00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:08.900]   Soundproofing.
[00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:11.900]   We don't want you to be bothered by us.
[00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:16.900]   Good to have you from the Pixel Core, Alex Lindsay on the Twitter, also here at Andy.
[00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:19.900]   And not cool, the Chicago Sun Times.
[00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:20.900]   Hello, Andrew.
[00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:21.900]   And...
[00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:22.900]   Let's not ask.
[00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:24.900]   What should we not ask?
[00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:28.900]   No, I was just going to make a wise, wise-ass con comment.
[00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:29.900]   I think we should prefer it.
[00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:33.900]   Do not let me suppress the wise-assery.
[00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:36.900]   I think the wise-assery must continue.
[00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:41.900]   Fortunately, my wise-assery, like a liquid, will expand to fill any volume that's been taken.
[00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:44.900]   So, no worries there.
[00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:48.900]   Also, from I'm where he's back, sinus infection healed?
[00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:50.900]   No, you apologize for my voice.
[00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:52.900]   You've got sick guy hair.
[00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:53.900]   It's wonderful.
[00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:54.900]   You're just going to have to know.
[00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:55.900]   Oh, really?
[00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:59.900]   No, I took a shower and because it's a humid cold, this is what happened to me.
[00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:01.900]   Oh, the humid cold is the worst, isn't it?
[00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:04.900]   It's like minus 15 or 20 or something, but it's humid.
[00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:05.900]   So, it's...
[00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:07.900]   How do all Canadians not get...
[00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:09.900]   How do they not all get sick this time of year?
[00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:10.900]   Just all of them.
[00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:11.900]   I don't know.
[00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:14.900]   Like, I went to the doctor and they said, "Well, the good news is that it's viral in the last
[00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:15.900]   for six weeks."
[00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:16.900]   And I said, "That's not good news."
[00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:18.900]   And they said, "Well, if we call it good news, it sounds better."
[00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:22.900]   That's bedside manner for you.
[00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:24.900]   That's hysterical.
[00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:26.900]   I apologize for my voice.
[00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:30.900]   Yesterday was a day that will live in infamy.
[00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:37.900]   January 9th, 2007, the birth of this little doohickey here, the iPhone.
[00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:40.900]   You've got yours, Renee's reaching over to get his.
[00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:42.900]   I charged mine up.
[00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:44.900]   And what's amazing is it still works.
[00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:47.900]   It's still so pretty, isn't it?
[00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:48.900]   Andrew?
[00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:49.900]   Andrew?
[00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:50.900]   I'm sorry.
[00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:56.900]   I grabbed for another handheld device with rounded corners and a highlight center button.
[00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:58.900]   This one came out two or three years before that.
[00:03:58.900 --> 00:03:59.900]   Too many buttons.
[00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:00.900]   Too many buttons.
[00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:01.900]   They're so easy to...
[00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:02.900]   Oh, there you go.
[00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:03.900]   That's the one.
[00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:04.900]   Oh, yeah.
[00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:07.900]   All of us have this old phone collection lying around.
[00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:08.900]   I was disappointed.
[00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:09.900]   I had to point somewhere.
[00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:10.900]   I lost it in a move.
[00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:11.900]   It's in some box.
[00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:12.900]   There's some box.
[00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:13.900]   I didn't want to give it up.
[00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:14.900]   I was disappointed neither.
[00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:16.900]   I mean, I guess what even then we knew was historic.
[00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:18.900]   I was disappointed because I had erased the contents.
[00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:19.900]   I was hoping to find...
[00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:21.900]   You know, pictures from 2008.
[00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:22.900]   Two megapixel pictures.
[00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:23.900]   Yeah.
[00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:28.900]   So I'm trying to remember, Alex, were you with me in the room when Steve made the announcement?
[00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:29.900]   I know Scott Born was.
[00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:30.900]   I think you were.
[00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:33.900]   I think you were sitting next to me.
[00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:34.900]   Yeah, I think I was.
[00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:35.900]   Yeah.
[00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:36.900]   It was you on my left.
[00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:37.900]   You were there.
[00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:38.900]   Scott Born on my right.
[00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:39.900]   I don't remember if Merlin was there or not.
[00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:42.900]   The original Mac Break team.
[00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:48.900]   And Scott, I remember Scott Born had been talking for two years on Mac Break Weekly about...
[00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:52.900]   How he couldn't wait for the iPhone.
[00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:56.900]   Didn't he throw his trio on the floor and stomp on it as soon as it was announced and then
[00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:57.900]   find out it was six months away?
[00:04:57.900 --> 00:04:59.900]   Yes, I think he did.
[00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:04.900]   Let me get the Steve Jobs iPhone announcement up here for you.
[00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:05.900]   What a great...
[00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:06.900]   I rewatched it again.
[00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:08.900]   Just what an artist at the height of his powers.
[00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:13.900]   I think absolutely Steve at his absolute best.
[00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:15.900]   I'm not sure which will be...
[00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:17.900]   It's chiefly just...
[00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:18.900]   Here we go.
[00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:19.900]   James Brown.
[00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:21.900]   James Brown.
[00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:23.900]   Good God.
[00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:27.900]   Skip ahead a little bit to about a minute in on this.
[00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:29.900]   This is him just coming out on the stage.
[00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:34.900]   This is during Macworld Expo, so he's at the Moscone West, the giant auditorium there.
[00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:36.900]   He's throwing with us as 2006.
[00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:38.900]   It's one minute in, a little bit back.
[00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:40.900]   There'd be a glowing apple.
[00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:42.900]   Oh, actually no more than one minute in on this.
[00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:43.900]   You were there.
[00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:44.900]   Go backwards.
[00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:46.900]   No way back.
[00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:48.900]   You were way far ahead.
[00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:50.900]   I don't know, maybe not.
[00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:52.900]   Oh, they're still using the same template.
[00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:53.900]   You know what?
[00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:54.900]   Let me do it.
[00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:55.900]   Go ahead.
[00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:56.900]   Yeah.
[00:05:56.900 --> 00:05:57.900]   But we didn't do this alone.
[00:05:57.900 --> 00:05:58.900]   Okay.
[00:05:58.900 --> 00:05:59.900]   So I'm sorry.
[00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:00.900]   I thought you had a cue.
[00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:02.900]   We did this with lots and lots of lawyers.
[00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:03.900]   Lots and lots of lawyers.
[00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:06.900]   So pause for refreshment.
[00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:07.900]   Well, I...
[00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:09.900]   Can I put the link in the show notes?
[00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:10.900]   Yeah.
[00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:11.900]   Yeah.
[00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:12.900]   Thank you.
[00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:13.900]   There we go.
[00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:17.460]   What I was going to say is that the real thing is like you could see that he has been dying
[00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:22.180]   to give this keynote for a year and a half, two years, and he's just excited as anything
[00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:24.740]   just to finally be able to show this thing off.
[00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:31.500]   But there's a backstory because we also know that this was a very unlikely to succeed demo.
[00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:35.540]   And the engineers were all sitting in the front rows with a bottle of liquor.
[00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:36.740]   And each time the engineer-
[00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:37.740]   Hold it half.
[00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:44.100]   For any responsible for any part of the demos section passed successfully, take a shot.
[00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:46.380]   And they ended up in drunk.
[00:06:46.380 --> 00:06:50.100]   Anything involving a radio was not good.
[00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:53.340]   There were only a few, a handful of working iPhones.
[00:06:53.340 --> 00:06:56.620]   There was he had two on stage in case the first one failed.
[00:06:56.620 --> 00:07:01.380]   And there was one exact and only path that Steve could take through the demo that would
[00:07:01.380 --> 00:07:02.380]   work.
[00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:03.780]   Anything else would guarantee to crash it here.
[00:07:03.780 --> 00:07:04.780]   Let's watch.
[00:07:04.780 --> 00:07:12.260]   When you know that, Steve's presence and centeredness is remarkable given the risky
[00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:13.940]   territories about to enter.
[00:07:13.940 --> 00:07:18.220]   Well, he knows he's not going to get fired.
[00:07:18.220 --> 00:07:26.820]   Every once in a while, a revolutionary product comes along that changes everything.
[00:07:26.820 --> 00:07:33.500]   And Apple has been, well, first of all, one's very fortunate if you get to work on just
[00:07:33.500 --> 00:07:38.060]   one of these in your career.
[00:07:38.060 --> 00:07:40.260]   Apple's been very fortunate.
[00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:44.820]   It's been able to introduce a few of these into the world.
[00:07:44.820 --> 00:07:48.980]   In 1984, we introduced the Macintosh.
[00:07:48.980 --> 00:07:51.180]   It didn't just change Apple.
[00:07:51.180 --> 00:07:53.860]   Let's skip ahead and just change the whole computer industry.
[00:07:53.860 --> 00:07:55.860]   Although it's coming up pretty quick.
[00:07:55.860 --> 00:07:57.420]   I'll let him continue to.
[00:07:57.420 --> 00:07:59.780]   It's fun to watch this.
[00:07:59.780 --> 00:08:02.020]   A master in his prime.
[00:08:02.020 --> 00:08:04.700]   He's not ill at this point, right?
[00:08:04.700 --> 00:08:05.860]   It's very fun.
[00:08:05.860 --> 00:08:11.460]   2001, we introduced the first iPod.
[00:08:11.460 --> 00:08:18.260]   And it didn't just change the way we all listen to music.
[00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:19.980]   It changed the entire music industry.
[00:08:19.980 --> 00:08:22.620]   Yeah, now if you look healthy here.
[00:08:22.620 --> 00:08:34.900]   Well, today we're introducing three revolutionary products of this class.
[00:08:34.900 --> 00:08:42.980]   The first one is a widescreen iPod with touch controls.
[00:08:42.980 --> 00:08:54.340]   Now, let me pause for a moment and ask you, Renee, you weren't in the audience.
[00:08:54.340 --> 00:08:56.340]   You were probably 12 years old when this happened.
[00:08:56.340 --> 00:09:00.260]   No, right before I started working at iMOR.
[00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:01.540]   Andy, you must have been, though, right?
[00:09:01.540 --> 00:09:03.540]   You were going to Mac.
[00:09:03.540 --> 00:09:04.540]   Yeah, I was there.
[00:09:04.540 --> 00:09:05.540]   Yeah.
[00:09:05.540 --> 00:09:09.700]   So Alex and Andy, we all thought there was going to be an iPhone, right?
[00:09:09.700 --> 00:09:11.180]   But there wasn't, but no confirmation.
[00:09:11.180 --> 00:09:14.180]   Of course, this is back when Apple really had the lid on things.
[00:09:14.180 --> 00:09:17.300]   So there was no sneaky rumor, right?
[00:09:17.300 --> 00:09:21.300]   Well, I think I had this feeling when that, when this part happened, I was like, oh, no,
[00:09:21.300 --> 00:09:22.300]   we're not going to get the phone.
[00:09:22.300 --> 00:09:23.940]   No, no, he was talking about an iPod.
[00:09:23.940 --> 00:09:24.940]   I was like iPod.
[00:09:24.940 --> 00:09:25.940]   You know, it was iPod.
[00:09:25.940 --> 00:09:26.940]   Right.
[00:09:26.940 --> 00:09:28.100]   It was a great, it was incredible build up.
[00:09:28.100 --> 00:09:30.860]   In fact, the applause of that point is a little lukewarm.
[00:09:30.860 --> 00:09:33.620]   Yeah, they're like, what?
[00:09:33.620 --> 00:09:35.740]   We thought there would be a phone at this announcement, though, right, Andy?
[00:09:35.740 --> 00:09:36.980]   I mean, we're pretty sure there was.
[00:09:36.980 --> 00:09:39.300]   Yeah, that was, that was pretty much a lock.
[00:09:39.300 --> 00:09:44.820]   But they had a really good leash down on what the details of that device would be.
[00:09:44.820 --> 00:09:48.180]   And I don't think anybody was expecting anything like the iPhone.
[00:09:48.180 --> 00:09:52.740]   They were expecting certainly expecting something much better than, you know, something that
[00:09:52.740 --> 00:09:57.340]   looked like this, say, but no one had the, had the fourth thought to say, no, it's going
[00:09:57.340 --> 00:09:58.340]   to be an all touch screen thing.
[00:09:58.340 --> 00:10:00.460]   There's going to be only one mechanical button.
[00:10:00.460 --> 00:10:04.700]   So there's an immense amount of excitement because every, but it's not that, oh, well,
[00:10:04.700 --> 00:10:08.300]   maybe we'll finally get an update to the iMac this year, or maybe we'll get, you know, this
[00:10:08.300 --> 00:10:10.620]   is the one where we will get the touch bar on the new Mac book.
[00:10:10.620 --> 00:10:14.220]   It's going to be, there's going to be a brand new product that we have absolutely never
[00:10:14.220 --> 00:10:15.220]   seen before.
[00:10:15.220 --> 00:10:17.660]   And nobody knows exactly what form it's going to take.
[00:10:17.660 --> 00:10:19.300]   There was an immense amount of excitement.
[00:10:19.300 --> 00:10:20.860]   I think we thought that I do.
[00:10:20.860 --> 00:10:24.660]   And I think Scott Warren, as I remember, was saying he called it the iPhone, but nobody
[00:10:24.660 --> 00:10:26.140]   knew even what the name was going to be.
[00:10:26.140 --> 00:10:29.580]   That just seemed like, you know, that was a placeholder.
[00:10:29.580 --> 00:10:38.140]   So I'll skip back just a second so you can hear the applause when he says the first one
[00:10:38.140 --> 00:10:40.940]   is a wide screen iPod with touch controls.
[00:10:40.940 --> 00:10:47.220]   There's some good cheering there, but I don't know, this is when video is brand new on that
[00:10:47.220 --> 00:10:48.220]   podcast.
[00:10:48.220 --> 00:10:49.220]   All right.
[00:10:49.220 --> 00:10:50.220]   Okay.
[00:10:50.220 --> 00:10:56.700]   The second is a revolutionary multi-phone.
[00:10:56.700 --> 00:10:57.700]   That's the cheering.
[00:10:57.700 --> 00:11:00.620]   And now that confirms what we'd suspected.
[00:11:00.620 --> 00:11:01.620]   There's a phone.
[00:11:01.620 --> 00:11:02.620]   But we're still positive.
[00:11:02.620 --> 00:11:03.620]   Go ahead, Renee.
[00:11:03.620 --> 00:11:08.860]   If you think about it for a second, that very first slide took Apple's most successful,
[00:11:08.860 --> 00:11:14.740]   most profitable product of the day and deprecated it to an app in one sentence.
[00:11:14.740 --> 00:11:15.740]   Isn't that amazing?
[00:11:15.740 --> 00:11:16.740]   That's a good point.
[00:11:16.740 --> 00:11:19.420]   Isn't that amazing?
[00:11:19.420 --> 00:11:24.940]   And the third is a breakthrough Internet communications device.
[00:11:24.940 --> 00:11:27.900]   People a little more puzzled at this point.
[00:11:27.900 --> 00:11:31.020]   Like, um, look at that now.
[00:11:31.020 --> 00:11:32.020]   Okay.
[00:11:32.020 --> 00:11:33.020]   Yeah.
[00:11:33.020 --> 00:11:36.140]   So Renee, no one knew at the time whether this was going to be a success or not.
[00:11:36.140 --> 00:11:41.540]   I mean, we, Apple fans, we were all very excited and wanted it, but, but there was, even Apple
[00:11:41.540 --> 00:11:43.420]   didn't know how big a success it was.
[00:11:43.420 --> 00:11:44.700]   People thought it wouldn't be an excess.
[00:11:44.700 --> 00:11:46.780]   Well, and one phone on one network for $600.
[00:11:46.780 --> 00:11:47.780]   Right.
[00:11:47.780 --> 00:11:48.780]   Well, we didn't know that yet.
[00:11:48.780 --> 00:11:51.500]   And the phone companies are telling us how to accomplish it.
[00:11:51.500 --> 00:11:52.500]   Go ahead.
[00:11:52.500 --> 00:11:55.620]   The phone companies were like, I, you know, all the phone companies that make phones,
[00:11:55.620 --> 00:12:00.380]   they're, I don't think that Apple understands how complicated they can put things is, you
[00:12:00.380 --> 00:12:02.780]   know, well, you know, they're going to, they're going to learn.
[00:12:02.780 --> 00:12:03.780]   Yeah.
[00:12:03.780 --> 00:12:04.780]   I thought that.
[00:12:04.780 --> 00:12:09.420]   I thought, why would Apple want to get in this awful, horrific business?
[00:12:09.420 --> 00:12:17.860]   So three things, a widescreen iPod with touch controls, a revolutionary mobile phone, and
[00:12:17.860 --> 00:12:23.060]   a breakthrough Internet communications device.
[00:12:23.060 --> 00:12:29.860]   An iPod, a phone, and an Internet communicator.
[00:12:29.860 --> 00:12:32.860]   iPod.
[00:12:32.860 --> 00:12:36.860]   Oh, now we start.
[00:12:36.860 --> 00:12:39.860]   That's, oh.
[00:12:39.860 --> 00:12:41.500]   Are you getting it?
[00:12:41.500 --> 00:12:45.540]   These are not three separate devices.
[00:12:45.540 --> 00:12:51.660]   This is one device.
[00:12:51.660 --> 00:12:54.860]   And we are calling it iPhone.
[00:12:54.860 --> 00:12:57.420]   And that was it.
[00:12:57.420 --> 00:12:58.820]   That was it.
[00:12:58.820 --> 00:13:01.260]   I, I'll never forget that moment.
[00:13:01.260 --> 00:13:02.660]   Yeah.
[00:13:02.660 --> 00:13:06.580]   And I'm sure Scott porn was at that point jump, had leapt to his feet.
[00:13:06.580 --> 00:13:10.300]   Harry McCracken was retweeting some of the live tweets from Mackerel yesterday.
[00:13:10.300 --> 00:13:13.420]   Oh, it's like, you know, 3000 or 6000 day old tweets.
[00:13:13.420 --> 00:13:15.580]   It's like, doesn't Cisco own the iPhone trademark?
[00:13:15.580 --> 00:13:16.580]   What is Apple doing?
[00:13:16.580 --> 00:13:17.580]   Right.
[00:13:17.580 --> 00:13:18.940]   This is interesting, but there's no way people will buy it.
[00:13:18.940 --> 00:13:19.940]   Right.
[00:13:19.940 --> 00:13:25.220]   I read a comment thread on, I can't remember, was nine to five or Mac rumors where half
[00:13:25.220 --> 00:13:27.220]   the people were just saying, this is ridiculous.
[00:13:27.220 --> 00:13:28.820]   I would never buy this.
[00:13:28.820 --> 00:13:30.740]   It was not a lock by any means.
[00:13:30.740 --> 00:13:33.860]   Apple fans were really excited, but it was not a lock.
[00:13:33.860 --> 00:13:37.060]   But we also know is that what he's going to tell us, which is your right.
[00:13:37.060 --> 00:13:40.580]   And he's $650 and six months from now.
[00:13:40.580 --> 00:13:41.580]   Yeah.
[00:13:41.580 --> 00:13:45.460]   We should be, we should be a little patient with all these people who back in the day
[00:13:45.460 --> 00:13:49.900]   were skeptical because we're not just talking about in an era where the phone is free with
[00:13:49.900 --> 00:13:50.900]   a contract.
[00:13:50.900 --> 00:13:55.540]   It gives us $650, but also no, it doesn't work with Microsoft Exchange.
[00:13:55.540 --> 00:13:58.740]   No, it doesn't have, it doesn't have cut and paste.
[00:13:58.740 --> 00:13:59.740]   No, it doesn't have apps.
[00:13:59.740 --> 00:14:00.740]   No, it doesn't have.
[00:14:00.740 --> 00:14:05.060]   You go through the list of everything that made like, everything that made like a phone
[00:14:05.060 --> 00:14:09.220]   like this super, super popular, everything that made the blackberries super, super popular
[00:14:09.220 --> 00:14:10.220]   and important.
[00:14:10.220 --> 00:14:11.220]   No, not.
[00:14:11.220 --> 00:14:14.060]   Well, let's watch that part of it here.
[00:14:14.060 --> 00:14:15.060]   Mobile device.
[00:14:15.060 --> 00:14:20.700]   Well, what we're going to do is get rid of all these buttons and just make a giant screen
[00:14:20.700 --> 00:14:21.700]   of any of the iPhone.
[00:14:21.700 --> 00:14:22.700]   Now, how are we going to communicate this?
[00:14:22.700 --> 00:14:23.700]   We don't want to carry around a mouse, right?
[00:14:23.700 --> 00:14:24.700]   So what are we going to do?
[00:14:24.700 --> 00:14:25.700]   Oh, a stylist, right?
[00:14:25.700 --> 00:14:27.700]   We're going to use a stylist.
[00:14:27.700 --> 00:14:28.700]   No.
[00:14:28.700 --> 00:14:30.700]   Who wants a stylist?
[00:14:30.700 --> 00:14:31.700]   No.
[00:14:31.700 --> 00:14:35.700]   You have to get them and put them away and you lose them.
[00:14:35.700 --> 00:14:36.700]   Yuck.
[00:14:36.700 --> 00:14:37.700]   Nobody wants a stylist.
[00:14:37.700 --> 00:14:38.700]   So let's not use a.
[00:14:38.700 --> 00:14:46.980]   That for a few more years anyway.
[00:14:46.980 --> 00:14:51.300]   The stylist was funny is that that was an absolute biggest screen they could do at that point.
[00:14:51.300 --> 00:14:55.660]   It was 3.5 was the limits of technology and density when they made that.
[00:14:55.660 --> 00:14:56.660]   This is an iPhone.
[00:14:56.660 --> 00:15:00.860]   I don't know if we have a tight shot, but this is the iPhone and this is the iPhone 7.
[00:15:00.860 --> 00:15:03.740]   So you know, 10 years later, it looks like the iPhones.
[00:15:03.740 --> 00:15:06.540]   Yeah, it's like three and a half inches.
[00:15:06.540 --> 00:15:07.540]   Yeah.
[00:15:07.540 --> 00:15:08.540]   Yeah.
[00:15:08.540 --> 00:15:11.540]   Well, and that's the other thing.
[00:15:11.540 --> 00:15:16.860]   This was harder to do than you really can imagine because none of this stuff had been
[00:15:16.860 --> 00:15:22.620]   created in mass quantities before the digitize your screen, the radio, all of this stuff.
[00:15:22.620 --> 00:15:23.620]   Apple had event.
[00:15:23.620 --> 00:15:25.380]   And now here we are 10 years later.
[00:15:25.380 --> 00:15:29.740]   Thank you, Apple, because this stuff is easy and cheap and that's why we have drones.
[00:15:29.740 --> 00:15:35.060]   That's why we have self-driving cars, 100 products that come from the fact that this
[00:15:35.060 --> 00:15:38.660]   sold a billion copies and the manufacturer was streamlined.
[00:15:38.660 --> 00:15:42.820]   And if you back up, you know, this wouldn't have been possible without the iPod without
[00:15:42.820 --> 00:15:46.580]   Apple being able to reinvent itself and be able to create a whole other business model
[00:15:46.580 --> 00:15:51.420]   that gave them the money to do that R&D, to give them money to have the market, to be
[00:15:51.420 --> 00:15:52.900]   able to dive into that.
[00:15:52.900 --> 00:15:59.340]   So it's very much of a, you know, one thing after the other where it's, if you look back
[00:15:59.340 --> 00:16:03.340]   on, I mean, Apple had been playing with this idea of touch screens and all the things that
[00:16:03.340 --> 00:16:09.220]   we see in an iPod for decades, but they just couldn't quite get their head around it.
[00:16:09.220 --> 00:16:12.100]   And they finally had the money and the time to work it out.
[00:16:12.100 --> 00:16:15.860]   And interestingly enough, I guess the iPhone was first because they couldn't make the screens
[00:16:15.860 --> 00:16:16.860]   bigger.
[00:16:16.860 --> 00:16:19.060]   Because the iPad would make the iPad better.
[00:16:19.060 --> 00:16:20.060]   Yeah.
[00:16:20.060 --> 00:16:24.100]   And they were so uncertain that the iPhone would ship that they originally had two branches.
[00:16:24.100 --> 00:16:26.500]   They had P1 that 20 Fidel was running.
[00:16:26.500 --> 00:16:30.620]   That was essentially the iPod phone that was much simpler than they had P2.
[00:16:30.620 --> 00:16:36.180]   These are both part of the purple experience project that Apple P2, which was the one that
[00:16:36.180 --> 00:16:39.660]   Scott forest all everybody was running, which was the attempt to put OS 10 and multi touch
[00:16:39.660 --> 00:16:41.460]   and everything onto a phone.
[00:16:41.460 --> 00:16:45.500]   And thankfully that was there was some debate about whether they'd have to ship P1 before
[00:16:45.500 --> 00:16:47.820]   P2 because it just might not be ready in time.
[00:16:47.820 --> 00:16:49.420]   But P2 actually blew past it.
[00:16:49.420 --> 00:16:52.580]   It did things like SMS first and they were able to get the iPhone out.
[00:16:52.580 --> 00:16:53.660]   It would be a very different world.
[00:16:53.660 --> 00:16:55.700]   I think if an iPod phone had shipped.
[00:16:55.700 --> 00:17:01.660]   Sonny Dixon earlier this week leaked these photos of a prototype interface, including
[00:17:01.660 --> 00:17:03.420]   a click wheel of all things.
[00:17:03.420 --> 00:17:04.420]   That's P1.
[00:17:04.420 --> 00:17:05.420]   Yeah.
[00:17:05.420 --> 00:17:10.060]   And it made sense because you have this great successful product, the iPod.
[00:17:10.060 --> 00:17:15.540]   You just use the same UI as the iPod.
[00:17:15.540 --> 00:17:16.980]   It would have been looking back on it.
[00:17:16.980 --> 00:17:17.980]   It would have been funky.
[00:17:17.980 --> 00:17:19.980]   Like you would have been like, absolutely.
[00:17:19.980 --> 00:17:20.980]   Oh, absolutely.
[00:17:20.980 --> 00:17:21.980]   Thank God.
[00:17:21.980 --> 00:17:24.780]   You know, it would have been a really weird, weird interface.
[00:17:24.780 --> 00:17:25.780]   Why the acorn?
[00:17:25.780 --> 00:17:29.260]   I've been wondering in this demo video, an acorn pops up first as they booted up.
[00:17:29.260 --> 00:17:31.340]   They just have like there's alpine was on the iPhone.
[00:17:31.340 --> 00:17:32.340]   It's just a code name.
[00:17:32.340 --> 00:17:33.340]   Okay.
[00:17:33.340 --> 00:17:38.980]   This is obviously a clandestine video of the interface probably shot at the time.
[00:17:38.980 --> 00:17:42.020]   I don't know.
[00:17:42.020 --> 00:17:44.300]   But yeah, this looks like an iPod.
[00:17:44.300 --> 00:17:49.620]   And the funny thing is Steve in his presentation, if we jump back a little bit, tricks everybody
[00:17:49.620 --> 00:17:54.700]   after he announces the iPhone by showing a a quick wheelbase.
[00:17:54.700 --> 00:17:56.700]   That was the rumor, right?
[00:17:56.700 --> 00:18:00.420]   Yeah, actually puts a big phone dial on it.
[00:18:00.420 --> 00:18:01.420]   That's great.
[00:18:01.420 --> 00:18:03.620]   And then master's showman watch.
[00:18:03.620 --> 00:18:04.620]   I love this.
[00:18:04.620 --> 00:18:05.620]   Watch this.
[00:18:05.620 --> 00:18:09.540]   So he does this.
[00:18:09.540 --> 00:18:12.100]   Actually here it is, but we're going to leave it there for now.
[00:18:12.100 --> 00:18:17.820]   Oh, he takes it out of his pocket and puts it back in master's showman.
[00:18:17.820 --> 00:18:22.100]   So he's explaining the UI, you know, and this is a unique UI.
[00:18:22.100 --> 00:18:26.220]   It's far more accurate than any touch display that's ever been shipped.
[00:18:26.220 --> 00:18:27.220]   Works like magic.
[00:18:27.220 --> 00:18:28.700]   It's not unintended touches.
[00:18:28.700 --> 00:18:31.220]   It's super smart.
[00:18:31.220 --> 00:18:37.820]   You can do multi finger gestures on it and boy have we patented it.
[00:18:37.820 --> 00:18:40.620]   Why did he say that?
[00:18:40.620 --> 00:18:44.700]   Why do you think that Microsoft lost its over the Macintosh and Windows?
[00:18:44.700 --> 00:18:45.700]   Okay.
[00:18:45.700 --> 00:18:46.700]   Okay.
[00:18:46.700 --> 00:18:49.540]   That's a very Steve thing too, isn't it?
[00:18:49.540 --> 00:18:53.260]   He was very, I mean, that when you look back, you're all the sum of our damage and when you
[00:18:53.260 --> 00:18:58.140]   look back at how personally he took losing out the PC interface to Microsoft and then
[00:18:58.140 --> 00:18:59.300]   how he went after Android.
[00:18:59.300 --> 00:19:01.060]   Like that was all very personal.
[00:19:01.060 --> 00:19:02.060]   Yeah.
[00:19:02.060 --> 00:19:04.740]   But also a lot of people were chasing after this.
[00:19:04.740 --> 00:19:09.220]   So it was really, really important to make sure that he that whatever research they had
[00:19:09.220 --> 00:19:11.660]   done originally that they could actually lock down for.
[00:19:11.660 --> 00:19:16.540]   It's not as though this kind of sprung full.
[00:19:16.540 --> 00:19:19.940]   They were certainly there years before anybody else could have possibly delivered it.
[00:19:19.940 --> 00:19:22.980]   But like the Mac interface, there were a lot of people who thought this would be a good
[00:19:22.980 --> 00:19:25.140]   idea for some sort of a tablet device.
[00:19:25.140 --> 00:19:31.340]   There was a really incredibly insane, like a scholastic multi touch demo with sort of
[00:19:31.340 --> 00:19:35.420]   a tabletop sort of thing showing how we can manipulate documents and it wasn't like the
[00:19:35.420 --> 00:19:36.700]   greatest demo of all time.
[00:19:36.700 --> 00:19:38.340]   No, but I'm ever seeing it.
[00:19:38.340 --> 00:19:39.340]   But it was.
[00:19:39.340 --> 00:19:40.340]   Yeah.
[00:19:40.340 --> 00:19:41.340]   Yeah.
[00:19:41.340 --> 00:19:42.340]   So there were so there were a lot of people who were chasing this and so you need to make
[00:19:42.340 --> 00:19:45.540]   sure that established that no, no, no, no, we've we own this.
[00:19:45.540 --> 00:19:47.900]   You're not going to say, aha, thank you for.
[00:19:47.900 --> 00:19:52.020]   We know we will now use the apples fast forward and built something by one of these taken
[00:19:52.020 --> 00:19:54.100]   apart and built something just like it.
[00:19:54.100 --> 00:19:55.740]   But Apple did not invent multi touch.
[00:19:55.740 --> 00:19:57.100]   It was invented at Carnegie Mellon.
[00:19:57.100 --> 00:20:00.060]   There was a very famous demo, multi touch a couple of years before this came out.
[00:20:00.060 --> 00:20:01.060]   They bought finger works.
[00:20:01.060 --> 00:20:02.060]   Yeah.
[00:20:02.060 --> 00:20:03.060]   Give them a big jumpstart.
[00:20:03.060 --> 00:20:04.060]   Do this.
[00:20:04.060 --> 00:20:06.820]   Well, we start with a strong foundation.
[00:20:06.820 --> 00:20:08.820]   iPhone runs OS 10.
[00:20:08.820 --> 00:20:11.940]   Now that's an interesting thing.
[00:20:11.940 --> 00:20:12.940]   Does it?
[00:20:12.940 --> 00:20:15.340]   It was like Tony's was Linux.
[00:20:15.340 --> 00:20:17.660]   So like the key one was Linux, but he too was.
[00:20:17.660 --> 00:20:18.660]   Yeah.
[00:20:18.660 --> 00:20:19.660]   It does.
[00:20:19.660 --> 00:20:23.020]   I asked that question directly just after the keynote during my briefing and said, yep,
[00:20:23.020 --> 00:20:25.700]   it is OS 10 with everything removed from it.
[00:20:25.700 --> 00:20:31.140]   That is not required for that's not required for use as a phone was hilarious is that the
[00:20:31.140 --> 00:20:35.580]   original Apple TV, the codename was a robot because it was lobotomized OS 10 tiger.
[00:20:35.580 --> 00:20:40.220]   And that actually gave them the confidence that they could reduce down what was OS 10
[00:20:40.220 --> 00:20:41.220]   to a much smaller device.
[00:20:41.220 --> 00:20:46.940]   The slide just before that though, that was actually kind of prophetic because it were
[00:20:46.940 --> 00:20:48.820]   five five years ahead of any other phone.
[00:20:48.820 --> 00:20:54.900]   And it really did take until 2012 before Android even started and the hardware started
[00:20:54.900 --> 00:20:55.900]   to get its act together.
[00:20:55.900 --> 00:20:59.740]   And you could say that it was only last year that they really started making things that
[00:20:59.740 --> 00:21:02.900]   were competitive functionally with an iPhone.
[00:21:02.900 --> 00:21:03.900]   He did that.
[00:21:03.900 --> 00:21:07.820]   And unfortunately, they started then they started catching fire and they were so far.
[00:21:07.820 --> 00:21:08.820]   He did.
[00:21:08.820 --> 00:21:11.300]   I think Steve really understood though.
[00:21:11.300 --> 00:21:14.180]   Here's what a revolution is about to.
[00:21:14.180 --> 00:21:19.940]   We've been very lucky to have brought a few revolutionary user interfaces to the market
[00:21:19.940 --> 00:21:21.580]   in our time.
[00:21:21.580 --> 00:21:23.860]   First was the mouse.
[00:21:23.860 --> 00:21:26.820]   The second was the click wheel.
[00:21:26.820 --> 00:21:30.780]   And now we're going to bring multi touch to the market.
[00:21:30.780 --> 00:21:37.140]   And each of these revolutionary user interfaces has made possible a revolutionary product,
[00:21:37.140 --> 00:21:40.380]   the Mac, the iPod and now the iPhone.
[00:21:40.380 --> 00:21:42.060]   He's kind of revisionist.
[00:21:42.060 --> 00:21:44.580]   I mean, no, he didn't say they invented it.
[00:21:44.580 --> 00:21:46.300]   He said they brought it to market.
[00:21:46.300 --> 00:21:48.300]   Very, very carefully.
[00:21:48.300 --> 00:21:49.980]   A little earlier, but that's okay.
[00:21:49.980 --> 00:21:51.420]   Yeah, I mean, it's fair.
[00:21:51.420 --> 00:21:53.260]   That's fair.
[00:21:53.260 --> 00:21:55.420]   They certainly made it as with everything Apple does.
[00:21:55.420 --> 00:21:57.820]   They made it an existing product.
[00:21:57.820 --> 00:22:00.860]   A couple of things I forgot about the original life.
[00:22:00.860 --> 00:22:01.860]   It's a French.
[00:22:01.860 --> 00:22:05.020]   Patrick Tallahandy, who still has his point of this.
[00:22:05.020 --> 00:22:07.580]   As we've ever shipped 160 PPI highest.
[00:22:07.580 --> 00:22:08.580]   Gorgeous.
[00:22:08.580 --> 00:22:10.780]   And on the front, there's only one button down there.
[00:22:10.780 --> 00:22:11.780]   We call it the home button.
[00:22:11.780 --> 00:22:13.740]   It takes you home from wherever you are.
[00:22:13.740 --> 00:22:14.740]   So there.
[00:22:14.740 --> 00:22:15.740]   That's it.
[00:22:15.740 --> 00:22:16.740]   I'll take a look at the side.
[00:22:16.740 --> 00:22:20.740]   Not on that, but the image on the home button is the outline of an app.
[00:22:20.740 --> 00:22:22.020]   Really nice subtle little touch.
[00:22:22.020 --> 00:22:23.260]   Oh, wait a minute.
[00:22:23.260 --> 00:22:24.500]   That's a good point.
[00:22:24.500 --> 00:22:26.220]   It's a little squirky.
[00:22:26.220 --> 00:22:27.220]   Yeah.
[00:22:27.220 --> 00:22:28.220]   Yeah.
[00:22:28.220 --> 00:22:29.220]   Of an app icon.
[00:22:29.220 --> 00:22:30.220]   Yeah.
[00:22:30.220 --> 00:22:31.620]   It's kind of thick compared to today's.
[00:22:31.620 --> 00:22:37.660]   It's thinner than any smartphone out there at 11.6 millimeters, thinner than the queue, thinner
[00:22:37.660 --> 00:22:39.780]   than the blackjack, thinner than all of them.
[00:22:39.780 --> 00:22:40.780]   What?
[00:22:40.780 --> 00:22:41.780]   The queue.
[00:22:41.780 --> 00:22:42.780]   The flesh.
[00:22:42.780 --> 00:22:43.780]   Really nice.
[00:22:43.780 --> 00:22:44.780]   Who remembers the queue in the blank?
[00:22:44.780 --> 00:22:45.780]   And we got some controls on the side.
[00:22:45.780 --> 00:22:46.780]   I remember the play.
[00:22:46.780 --> 00:22:47.780]   Very silently.
[00:22:47.780 --> 00:22:48.780]   We got a.
[00:22:48.780 --> 00:22:49.780]   Well, I know you and I do because that's our business, but yeah.
[00:22:49.780 --> 00:22:50.780]   Look at the back.
[00:22:50.780 --> 00:22:51.780]   Look at the size of the blackjack.
[00:22:51.780 --> 00:22:54.780]   Everything of note is we got a two megapixel camera built right in.
[00:22:54.780 --> 00:22:56.780]   Our sounds are good.
[00:22:56.780 --> 00:22:59.780]   That was good for the time.
[00:22:59.780 --> 00:23:00.780]   Yeah.
[00:23:00.780 --> 00:23:01.780]   I mean, this is a.
[00:23:01.780 --> 00:23:04.780]   Before it was 640 by 480 camera was a big deal.
[00:23:04.780 --> 00:23:05.780]   Right.
[00:23:05.780 --> 00:23:08.780]   You only took the only took pictures to here is where's what happened in the corner.
[00:23:08.780 --> 00:23:10.780]   And sent to your insurance company.
[00:23:10.780 --> 00:23:12.780]   It's not for actually taking pictures.
[00:23:12.780 --> 00:23:15.780]   The other side and we're back on the front.
[00:23:15.780 --> 00:23:17.780]   So let's take a look at the top now.
[00:23:17.780 --> 00:23:19.780]   We've got a headphone jack headset jack.
[00:23:19.780 --> 00:23:21.780]   By the way, use your standard headphones with.
[00:23:21.780 --> 00:23:24.780]   So deeply in set because the metal is so thick.
[00:23:24.780 --> 00:23:25.780]   Yes, you have to have it.
[00:23:25.780 --> 00:23:26.780]   Listen to what he says.
[00:23:26.780 --> 00:23:27.780]   He doesn't say your headset.
[00:23:27.780 --> 00:23:28.780]   He says your iPod headsets.
[00:23:28.780 --> 00:23:29.780]   Three and a half millimeter.
[00:23:29.780 --> 00:23:31.780]   All your iPod headphones fit right in.
[00:23:31.780 --> 00:23:32.780]   We've got a place.
[00:23:32.780 --> 00:23:34.780]   It will tray for your SIM card.
[00:23:34.780 --> 00:23:37.780]   And we've got one switch for sleep and wake.
[00:23:37.780 --> 00:23:38.780]   Just push it to go to sleep.
[00:23:38.780 --> 00:23:40.780]   Push it to wake up.
[00:23:40.780 --> 00:23:43.780]   Let's take a look at the bottom.
[00:23:43.780 --> 00:23:45.780]   We've got a speaker.
[00:23:45.780 --> 00:23:47.780]   We've got a microphone.
[00:23:47.780 --> 00:23:51.780]   And we've got our 30 pin iPod connector.
[00:23:51.780 --> 00:23:53.780]   So that's the bottom.
[00:23:53.780 --> 00:23:56.780]   Now, we've also got some stuff you can't see.
[00:23:56.780 --> 00:24:00.780]   We've got three really advanced sensors built into this phone.
[00:24:00.780 --> 00:24:02.780]   The first one is a proximity sensor.
[00:24:02.780 --> 00:24:04.780]   So we don't have to go too deep into this.
[00:24:04.780 --> 00:24:08.780]   The demo is interesting because now we know.
[00:24:08.780 --> 00:24:10.780]   First time ever on an iPod.
[00:24:10.780 --> 00:24:11.780]   Now we know.
[00:24:11.780 --> 00:24:13.780]   So we haven't talked about this some more.
[00:24:13.780 --> 00:24:14.780]   Let me show it to you.
[00:24:14.780 --> 00:24:16.780]   How risky this was at this point.
[00:24:16.780 --> 00:24:17.780]   Steve Stink.
[00:24:17.780 --> 00:24:24.780]   All the engineers are not in cloth seats so they can easily be wiped out.
[00:24:24.780 --> 00:24:29.780]   Now, I've got some special iPhones up here.
[00:24:29.780 --> 00:24:31.780]   They've got a little special board in them.
[00:24:31.780 --> 00:24:34.780]   Just like the checklist that Apollo astronauts have.
[00:24:34.780 --> 00:24:35.780]   You saw that.
[00:24:35.780 --> 00:24:39.780]   You will do this in exactly this order in the golden path this time.
[00:24:39.780 --> 00:24:42.780]   And it's only embedded in case of sudden project.
[00:24:42.780 --> 00:24:46.780]   But remembering back, I had a trio that would crash when it made phone calls, when it took
[00:24:46.780 --> 00:24:48.780]   phone calls, when it launched apps.
[00:24:48.780 --> 00:24:53.780]   And he shows going from music to answering the phone to email to web to back.
[00:24:53.780 --> 00:24:56.780]   And we all make fun of the iPhone for the lack of third party multitasking.
[00:24:56.780 --> 00:25:00.780]   But that was one of the most impressive mobile multitasking demos I'd ever seen at this time.
[00:25:00.780 --> 00:25:01.780]   Yeah.
[00:25:01.780 --> 00:25:03.780]   I can't remember how many he had.
[00:25:03.780 --> 00:25:06.780]   I think there were only one or two, right?
[00:25:06.780 --> 00:25:07.780]   There was two on that.
[00:25:07.780 --> 00:25:08.780]   I think on the podium.
[00:25:08.780 --> 00:25:09.780]   Get some digital video out.
[00:25:09.780 --> 00:25:11.780]   I got a little cord here which goes up to these projectors.
[00:25:11.780 --> 00:25:14.780]   I remember Alex at the time was going, "How do I get that?"
[00:25:14.780 --> 00:25:15.780]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:25:15.780 --> 00:25:16.780]   That'll get video out of this.
[00:25:16.780 --> 00:25:18.780]   We're like, "I want the cord."
[00:25:18.780 --> 00:25:19.780]   Forget the bone.
[00:25:19.780 --> 00:25:21.780]   I need the cord.
[00:25:21.780 --> 00:25:23.780]   And you're like, "I got some great images."
[00:25:23.780 --> 00:25:26.780]   And you get to see what it really looks like.
[00:25:26.780 --> 00:25:29.780]   So let me, I've got a camera here so you can see what I'm doing with my finger for a few
[00:25:29.780 --> 00:25:30.780]   seconds.
[00:25:30.780 --> 00:25:34.780]   And let me go ahead and get that picture within picture up.
[00:25:34.780 --> 00:25:37.780]   I'm going to go ahead and just push the sleep/wake button.
[00:25:37.780 --> 00:25:39.780]   There we go, right there.
[00:25:39.780 --> 00:25:40.780]   Singular.
[00:25:40.780 --> 00:25:42.780]   And to unlock the phone, I just take my finger.
[00:25:42.780 --> 00:25:43.780]   It doesn't even say AT&T.
[00:25:43.780 --> 00:25:45.780]   I think it says singular.
[00:25:45.780 --> 00:25:46.780]   It says singular.
[00:25:46.780 --> 00:25:47.780]   Okay.
[00:25:47.780 --> 00:25:48.780]   That was...
[00:25:48.780 --> 00:25:52.780]   You also forget that the only reason why, one of the reasons why this was such a breakthrough
[00:25:52.780 --> 00:25:58.780]   product was that every other mobile carrier was able to tell mobile phone, "Here is the
[00:25:58.780 --> 00:26:01.780]   product we're willing to buy from you, put in our stores."
[00:26:01.780 --> 00:26:05.780]   Also, here are the limits that we are going to put on you because our network cannot handle
[00:26:05.780 --> 00:26:08.780]   the web, so you're not going to put a full-board web browser.
[00:26:08.780 --> 00:26:09.780]   AT&T had just...
[00:26:09.780 --> 00:26:13.780]   They started off as AT&T wireless, and then they became singular, and then they switched
[00:26:13.780 --> 00:26:14.780]   back to AT&T again.
[00:26:14.780 --> 00:26:17.780]   They were not really a big carrier.
[00:26:17.780 --> 00:26:18.780]   And they picked up...
[00:26:18.780 --> 00:26:22.780]   They got exclusivity on the iPhone, chiefly because they're not the first company that Apple
[00:26:22.780 --> 00:26:23.780]   approached.
[00:26:23.780 --> 00:26:26.780]   The first company said, "Yes, please, by all means, give us a hot product that will put
[00:26:26.780 --> 00:26:28.780]   us on the map and get us subscribers."
[00:26:28.780 --> 00:26:29.780]   So that's really...
[00:26:29.780 --> 00:26:30.780]   Yes, we will give you a web browser.
[00:26:30.780 --> 00:26:31.780]   Yes.
[00:26:31.780 --> 00:26:33.780]   Verizon laughed them right out, didn't they?
[00:26:33.780 --> 00:26:34.780]   Yes, we turned them down.
[00:26:34.780 --> 00:26:35.780]   Yeah.
[00:26:35.780 --> 00:26:36.780]   Oops.
[00:26:36.780 --> 00:26:37.780]   Oops.
[00:26:37.780 --> 00:26:38.780]   It jumped back.
[00:26:38.780 --> 00:26:43.780]   Wi-Fi, 802.11N, and the latest Bluetooth 2.1.
[00:26:43.780 --> 00:26:45.780]   Wow, that's a weird image.
[00:26:45.780 --> 00:26:46.780]   And the user...
[00:26:46.780 --> 00:26:47.780]   This is wrong.
[00:26:47.780 --> 00:26:48.780]   This is the iPad.
[00:26:48.780 --> 00:26:49.780]   Somehow I got saved.
[00:26:49.780 --> 00:26:51.780]   Anyway, enough of that.
[00:26:51.780 --> 00:26:53.780]   Somehow I got to a different presentation.
[00:26:53.780 --> 00:26:56.780]   Well, what did...I mean, 10 years ago, it's amazing.
[00:26:56.780 --> 00:27:02.980]   What did 10 years have done that product has just been...I don't think there's a bigger
[00:27:02.980 --> 00:27:04.780]   tech product in history.
[00:27:04.780 --> 00:27:06.780]   What I realized is that the Macintosh was what?
[00:27:06.780 --> 00:27:07.780]   It was 1998.
[00:27:07.780 --> 00:27:12.780]   So it was like seven, eight years old at that point, and now it's 10 years since iPhone.
[00:27:12.780 --> 00:27:16.780]   So it's longer since the introduction of the iPhone than it was between iPhone and iMac.
[00:27:16.780 --> 00:27:17.780]   iMac came out in '88.
[00:27:17.780 --> 00:27:18.780]   '88, the iMac.
[00:27:18.780 --> 00:27:19.780]   Yeah, '98.
[00:27:19.780 --> 00:27:20.780]   Yeah, '98.
[00:27:20.780 --> 00:27:21.780]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:27:21.780 --> 00:27:22.780]   Wow.
[00:27:22.780 --> 00:27:24.780]   Yeah, '99 years, and then 10 years now.
[00:27:24.780 --> 00:27:26.780]   Oh, we're all getting old.
[00:27:26.780 --> 00:27:28.780]   Let's take a break.
[00:27:28.780 --> 00:27:30.780]   There's some big changes coming to Apple.
[00:27:30.780 --> 00:27:32.780]   We'll talk about that.
[00:27:32.780 --> 00:27:35.780]   Some interesting stories from Robert Scobel.
[00:27:35.780 --> 00:27:37.780]   We'll talk about that in Consumer Reports, backtracks.
[00:27:37.780 --> 00:27:42.780]   We'll talk about that, but first a word from our sponsor.
[00:27:42.780 --> 00:27:43.780]   Texture.
[00:27:43.780 --> 00:27:44.780]   Love.
[00:27:44.780 --> 00:27:46.780]   Texture was the...what the iPhone and iPad were invented.
[00:27:46.780 --> 00:27:49.780]   Why so somebody tweet that just the other day.
[00:27:49.780 --> 00:27:52.780]   This is the app for the iPad.
[00:27:52.780 --> 00:27:53.780]   What is texture?
[00:27:53.780 --> 00:27:54.780]   It's like Netflix for magazines.
[00:27:54.780 --> 00:28:01.780]   Some of your favorite magazines, all of them, hundreds of them, available with one low monthly
[00:28:01.780 --> 00:28:03.780]   subscription fee.
[00:28:03.780 --> 00:28:06.780]   Rolling Stone, Esquire, National Geographic.
[00:28:06.780 --> 00:28:10.780]   And they're all in the app, all on your iPad.
[00:28:10.780 --> 00:28:13.780]   It's easy to search for a specific article.
[00:28:13.780 --> 00:28:18.780]   There's curation, so even if you don't know a magazine, but there's a great article in it, you'll find it.
[00:28:18.780 --> 00:28:28.780]   This is so much less expensive and frankly so much more sensible than subscribing to 200 magazines or buying them on the newsstand.
[00:28:28.780 --> 00:28:33.780]   It's also fun to get...there's magazines in there that you might not actually think about getting or subscribing,
[00:28:33.780 --> 00:28:39.780]   but it's great to read like, "I, for me, it's ad week" and Billboard and stuff professionally.
[00:28:39.780 --> 00:28:41.780]   Also, there's always an article in the Atlantic.
[00:28:41.780 --> 00:28:43.780]   I want to read every month, National Geographic.
[00:28:43.780 --> 00:28:49.780]   Incidentally, photos look better on your iPad screen than they do in the print.
[00:28:49.780 --> 00:28:56.780]   Of course they do, so this is a better way to consume photography magazines and magazines like National Geographic.
[00:28:56.780 --> 00:28:58.780]   I just love it.
[00:28:58.780 --> 00:29:05.780]   Every page of the current newsstand issue plus back issues plus bonus features that don't work in print like video.
[00:29:05.780 --> 00:29:10.780]   Now normally it's $9.99 a month, which is amazing really if you think about it.
[00:29:10.780 --> 00:29:13.780]   That's buying two magazines in the newsstand.
[00:29:13.780 --> 00:29:15.780]   But there's always...the New York or Wired.
[00:29:15.780 --> 00:29:17.780]   Dwell, one of my favorite housing magazines.
[00:29:17.780 --> 00:29:19.780]   We were talking about that yesterday on iOS today.
[00:29:19.780 --> 00:29:20.780]   I love Dwell.
[00:29:20.780 --> 00:29:21.780]   I love to look at those great houses.
[00:29:21.780 --> 00:29:24.780]   I'm very happy with this and I know you will be too.
[00:29:24.780 --> 00:29:30.780]   Right now you get a 14-day free trial if you go to Texture to extuare.com/twit
[00:29:30.780 --> 00:29:32.780]   so you can see what it would be like.
[00:29:32.780 --> 00:29:33.780]   And by the way, I love this.
[00:29:33.780 --> 00:29:35.780]   You can have up to five devices.
[00:29:35.780 --> 00:29:36.780]   So we share.
[00:29:36.780 --> 00:29:39.780]   We have her family subscription.
[00:29:39.780 --> 00:29:41.780]   You can pre-download.
[00:29:41.780 --> 00:29:43.780]   I favorite the magazines I want to read all the time.
[00:29:43.780 --> 00:29:49.780]   And I can have them automatically downloaded so that when I get on the plane even if I forget ahead of time, I've got them.
[00:29:49.780 --> 00:29:54.780]   texture.com/twit/texture.com/twit.
[00:29:54.780 --> 00:29:55.780]   Why?
[00:29:55.780 --> 00:29:57.780]   Why buy paper magazines?
[00:29:57.780 --> 00:29:58.780]   I have all that clutter.
[00:29:58.780 --> 00:30:02.780]   Why I have all the expense when you can read it right there on your iPad.
[00:30:02.780 --> 00:30:05.780]   There's always something good to read if you've got texture.
[00:30:05.780 --> 00:30:07.780]   It's Mac Break Weekly Time.
[00:30:07.780 --> 00:30:11.780]   We've got Renee Richie, Alex Lindsey, Andy Inaco.
[00:30:11.780 --> 00:30:16.780]   Andy, do you decide yet if you're going to come out for Sal's dinner at the end of the month?
[00:30:16.780 --> 00:30:17.780]   I'm trying.
[00:30:17.780 --> 00:30:19.780]   I'm going to see if I can use my air miles to come out.
[00:30:19.780 --> 00:30:22.780]   So that's going to mean that I might have to.
[00:30:22.780 --> 00:30:23.780]   That would be super fun.
[00:30:23.780 --> 00:30:24.780]   It would be super fun.
[00:30:24.780 --> 00:30:26.780]   So I guess who's putting this on?
[00:30:26.780 --> 00:30:29.780]   I think it's Paul Kent who's in charge.
[00:30:29.780 --> 00:30:30.780]   That's who it is.
[00:30:30.780 --> 00:30:32.780]   Former Mac World Expo guy.
[00:30:32.780 --> 00:30:36.780]   And I presume Sal and Naomi will be there.
[00:30:36.780 --> 00:30:45.780]   I didn't pay for my $250 ticket without the celebrity speaker.
[00:30:45.780 --> 00:30:48.780]   I think it's just really neat.
[00:30:48.780 --> 00:30:54.780]   A tribute to the great Sal Saguayan dinner.
[00:30:54.780 --> 00:30:55.780]   Is it open to the public?
[00:30:55.780 --> 00:30:56.780]   I don't know.
[00:30:56.780 --> 00:30:57.780]   I guess not.
[00:30:57.780 --> 00:30:58.780]   I don't think so.
[00:30:58.780 --> 00:31:00.780]   There's no way you could do that, could you?
[00:31:00.780 --> 00:31:03.780]   You should do another one where it is open to the public.
[00:31:03.780 --> 00:31:06.780]   You'd have to rent.
[00:31:06.780 --> 00:31:07.780]   It was Liberty Road.
[00:31:07.780 --> 00:31:08.780]   Buscone West.
[00:31:08.780 --> 00:31:09.780]   Yeah.
[00:31:09.780 --> 00:31:10.780]   Big party.
[00:31:10.780 --> 00:31:11.780]   Sal party.
[00:31:11.780 --> 00:31:12.780]   I think it's nice.
[00:31:12.780 --> 00:31:16.780]   We should count on the next big Apple presentation.
[00:31:16.780 --> 00:31:18.780]   We'll just count a program with a with a sale tribute.
[00:31:18.780 --> 00:31:19.780]   I like that.
[00:31:19.780 --> 00:31:23.780]   I will tell you what, I will be there if you'll be there.
[00:31:23.780 --> 00:31:25.780]   So I don't, I'm going to wait and hear from you.
[00:31:25.780 --> 00:31:27.780]   And then if you're going there, I got to go.
[00:31:27.780 --> 00:31:28.780]   Got to go.
[00:31:28.780 --> 00:31:30.780]   And Alex, you should probably do since.
[00:31:30.780 --> 00:31:32.780]   I'm in Southeast Asia.
[00:31:32.780 --> 00:31:34.780]   I would absolutely be there.
[00:31:34.780 --> 00:31:35.780]   I was not.
[00:31:35.780 --> 00:31:37.780]   Well, yesterday I thought I was going to be able to make it.
[00:31:37.780 --> 00:31:39.780]   And so I was getting all the planning down.
[00:31:39.780 --> 00:31:40.780]   And then I.
[00:31:40.780 --> 00:31:42.780]   I need to be in Southeast Asia.
[00:31:42.780 --> 00:31:47.780]   So not the only person leaving news came out this morning broke this morning.
[00:31:47.780 --> 00:31:52.780]   I didn't even know when I sat down and Renee told me that Chris Lattner is leaving.
[00:31:52.780 --> 00:31:54.780]   Who's Chris Lattner Renee?
[00:31:54.780 --> 00:31:57.780]   Oh, hold on.
[00:31:57.780 --> 00:31:59.780]   We don't have any audio out of it.
[00:31:59.780 --> 00:32:02.780]   Sorry, Chris Lattner is head of developer tools at Apple.
[00:32:02.780 --> 00:32:06.780]   He's famous for doing everything from LLVM to clang.
[00:32:06.780 --> 00:32:10.780]   Basically the modern compilers that everybody used to make apps on Mac and.
[00:32:10.780 --> 00:32:12.780]   Well, LLVM is not just iOS.
[00:32:12.780 --> 00:32:14.780]   LLVM is used everywhere.
[00:32:14.780 --> 00:32:15.780]   It's everywhere.
[00:32:15.780 --> 00:32:16.780]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:32:16.780 --> 00:32:26.780]   And at Apple, most recently he's famous for taking this day to WDC a couple of years ago and introducing Swift, the new programming language that Apple is intending to use going forward.
[00:32:26.780 --> 00:32:33.780]   To say that he's had an impact in developer tools in general and Apple specifically is huge understatement.
[00:32:33.780 --> 00:32:42.780]   Xcode which he was responsible for compiles to LLVM which stands for low level virtual machine and it's a virtualization environment.
[00:32:42.780 --> 00:32:45.780]   Do you know the technical details of LLVM?
[00:32:45.780 --> 00:32:55.780]   I did at some point, but basically I believe it's an abstraction where it allows it to do a lot of optimization regardless of the specific target that you're aiming it at, which lets you be more flexible.
[00:32:55.780 --> 00:32:56.780]   What was your development?
[00:32:56.780 --> 00:32:57.780]   Well, it's flexible with your development.
[00:32:57.780 --> 00:33:04.780]   Lattner started it when he was at school at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 2000.
[00:33:04.780 --> 00:33:15.780]   And it was originally a research infrastructure according to Wikipedia then released with the open source license and that got him a job five years later at Apple in 2005.
[00:33:15.780 --> 00:33:27.780]   He's been there ever since posted on the Swift mailing list that he is leaving, posted it this morning at 11 a.m. Central Time.
[00:33:27.780 --> 00:33:34.780]   Ted Kremenek will be taking over his project leaving and Lattner says he will continue to be on the team for Swift.
[00:33:34.780 --> 00:33:41.780]   He's completely committed to Swift to plan to remain an active member of the Swift core team as well as a contributor to the Swift Evolution mailing list.
[00:33:41.780 --> 00:33:44.780]   It's open source now, so he can do that. It's not just an Apple project.
[00:33:44.780 --> 00:33:45.780]   Right.
[00:33:45.780 --> 00:33:48.780]   He doesn't say where he's going.
[00:33:48.780 --> 00:33:56.780]   He says merely I'm leaving Apple later this month to pursue an opportunity in another space.
[00:33:56.780 --> 00:34:00.780]   But, you know, ten or eleven years at a company is a long time for anybody.
[00:34:00.780 --> 00:34:09.780]   He's a young guy and I think it makes sense and it sounds like he's not going to be taking off and not contributing back to Swift.
[00:34:09.780 --> 00:34:13.780]   So, who knows? Somebody may be creating a big Swift thing.
[00:34:13.780 --> 00:34:18.780]   Well, I mean, to say that he's not important to Apple, he's saying Steve Jobs wasn't important.
[00:34:18.780 --> 00:34:23.780]   Obviously, the world, like Apple would be very different if a lot of these high profile people weren't there.
[00:34:23.780 --> 00:34:30.780]   But also, Apple's composed of a lot of incredibly talented people and he's left Swift and developer tools in really capable hands.
[00:34:30.780 --> 00:34:33.780]   So nothing to worry about there.
[00:34:33.780 --> 00:34:38.780]   No, but it is, again, it's a legend of our time moving on.
[00:34:38.780 --> 00:34:43.780]   Yeah, one of the great programmers. So it is surprising what, you know, that he's...
[00:34:43.780 --> 00:34:45.780]   Maybe not so.
[00:34:45.780 --> 00:34:51.780]   So sometimes people, people who are really, really intelligent, really, really operated at very, very high level,
[00:34:51.780 --> 00:34:56.780]   they, I know a lot of these people that they just don't like to stay in one place for that long.
[00:34:56.780 --> 00:34:58.780]   They really get it to be.
[00:34:58.780 --> 00:34:59.780]   Yeah.
[00:34:59.780 --> 00:35:07.780]   So, I mean, even, this is why I even wonder if Johnny Ive is terribly excited about not being able to design toasters, not being able to design,
[00:35:07.780 --> 00:35:12.780]   you know, I think one of the reasons why his role has expanded was because, tell you what, why don't you,
[00:35:12.780 --> 00:35:17.780]   we will let you design buildings down, we will let you design all kinds of other things because it must,
[00:35:17.780 --> 00:35:22.780]   it might be for some people kind of frustrating to be at that same job, even at such a high level for so long.
[00:35:22.780 --> 00:35:24.780]   He should, they should let him do toasters.
[00:35:24.780 --> 00:35:27.780]   I would love to see one.
[00:35:27.780 --> 00:35:28.780]   I would love to buy one.
[00:35:28.780 --> 00:35:32.780]   Of course, of course, it would only be able to toast PETA bread because it would be so thin, but still...
[00:35:32.780 --> 00:35:41.780]   It would be impossibly thin. You'd have to, in fact, you'd have to read, but it would redefine how bread is processed and how it will cut milk and toaster.
[00:35:41.780 --> 00:35:47.780]   But it's going to be less calories because, you know, they're going to cut all the bread will be a little denser and, and, you know,
[00:35:47.780 --> 00:35:51.780]   I'm sure that the manufacturers would first say this is crazy, but a couple of them would get ahead of it.
[00:35:51.780 --> 00:35:56.780]   Next thing you know, all of our toast is like that, that thin, pepperage farm, you know, kind of...
[00:35:56.780 --> 00:35:57.780]   Yeah.
[00:35:57.780 --> 00:36:08.780]   I think you could go to work for a dice. I just saw my, I got my haircut a couple of days ago, and the hairdresser had a $400 brand new Dyson hair blower that's just like this.
[00:36:08.780 --> 00:36:12.780]   It's just like, it looks like it's something out of another dimension. It's just a hole.
[00:36:12.780 --> 00:36:21.780]   And the higher comes out of there's no, there's no back to it. There's no, it's, of course, Dyson. They do some weird stuff, but it's pretty cool looking.
[00:36:21.780 --> 00:36:26.780]   They need to do that with the flow B so that it just, it just like the things you're hearing.
[00:36:26.780 --> 00:36:33.780]   But there's like a, there's like a space there with blades and just, it just like just sucks the air, the hair right out.
[00:36:33.780 --> 00:36:36.780]   That would be... I'm sorry.
[00:36:36.780 --> 00:36:43.780]   I hear, man. This is what the... I don't know how I got into this, but it's kind of cool. This is what it looks like.
[00:36:43.780 --> 00:36:48.780]   It's just a hot air comes somehow magically out of that hole.
[00:36:48.780 --> 00:36:51.780]   And you can see through it. It's like magic.
[00:36:51.780 --> 00:36:55.780]   They bring the air in through the bottom and then, and then project it.
[00:36:55.780 --> 00:36:59.780]   It's project, it's air projection.
[00:36:59.780 --> 00:37:01.780]   Yeah. It's pretty cool.
[00:37:01.780 --> 00:37:05.780]   High voltage through compressed outputs.
[00:37:05.780 --> 00:37:09.780]   I mean, you know, air sort of ways of high compression through compressed output.
[00:37:09.780 --> 00:37:15.780]   Yeah. That's a, that's a, some really interesting industrial design. Maybe Johnny can go there.
[00:37:15.780 --> 00:37:18.780]   If they, if they made a toaster like that, I'd be, I mean.
[00:37:18.780 --> 00:37:20.780]   Imagine a toaster fridge.
[00:37:20.780 --> 00:37:25.780]   Go on. You had me at fridge.
[00:37:25.780 --> 00:37:27.780]   An internet toaster fridge.
[00:37:27.780 --> 00:37:33.780]   Robert Scobel has an interesting story on Facebook. Don't know it's from CES.
[00:37:33.780 --> 00:37:39.780]   There is not a lot of Mac news at CES. In fact, some people said it's kind of odd that Apple, which has in the past without being at CES,
[00:37:39.780 --> 00:37:44.780]   has dominated CES, dominant the mindset because, of course, 2007,
[00:37:44.780 --> 00:37:48.780]   they announced the iPhone during CES. They announced the iPad in 2010 during CES.
[00:37:48.780 --> 00:37:50.780]   All anybody can talk about.
[00:37:50.780 --> 00:37:53.780]   2015 Mark Grumman leaked the MacBook during CES.
[00:37:53.780 --> 00:37:55.780]   Really? Yeah.
[00:37:55.780 --> 00:37:58.780]   So, oh, the Mac, the little thin one. Yeah.
[00:37:58.780 --> 00:38:01.780]   This year, nobody's talking really, except Robert's got quite a scoop.
[00:38:01.780 --> 00:38:05.780]   He was talking to a Zeiss employee. You know, Zeiss makes those lenses and licenses.
[00:38:05.780 --> 00:38:07.780]   The name is Sony and others.
[00:38:07.780 --> 00:38:13.780]   In fact, I think, I'm trying to think, is Sony an owner of Zeiss or just a big, I think they have a big stake in Zeiss.
[00:38:13.780 --> 00:38:20.780]   Anyway, Zeiss employee confirmed the rumors that Apple, according to Robert Scobel and Carl Zeiss AG, are working
[00:38:20.780 --> 00:38:25.780]   on a light pair of augmented reality mixed reality glasses.
[00:38:25.780 --> 00:38:30.780]   It may be announced this year. I thought it would be next year, says Scobel, but now I saw this.
[00:38:30.780 --> 00:38:32.780]   Now I saw this. I believe it will happen this year.
[00:38:32.780 --> 00:38:39.780]   What's interesting that might kind of confirm this is that Zeiss's booth was in the augmented reality pavilion,
[00:38:39.780 --> 00:38:41.780]   but they had nothing to show.
[00:38:41.780 --> 00:38:43.780]   It just was there.
[00:38:43.780 --> 00:38:46.780]   Except for a meeting room. They had a meeting room. Everyone went there on.
[00:38:46.780 --> 00:38:48.780]   Let's go and have a talk to them.
[00:38:48.780 --> 00:38:56.780]   And Scobel said, Scobel said, around the employees, you're not showing any mixed reality optics.
[00:38:56.780 --> 00:39:01.780]   Why not? And he said, Tim Cook didn't let you and the employees around me smile nervously.
[00:39:01.780 --> 00:39:03.780]   Maybe they just thought he was going to...
[00:39:03.780 --> 00:39:07.780]   I was trying to figure out what the news was.
[00:39:07.780 --> 00:39:12.780]   I don't mean that as a question mark. I mean, I was expecting him to say,
[00:39:12.780 --> 00:39:18.780]   "Well, I talked to a source who confirmed for me. He made a joke and got like a weak smile,
[00:39:18.780 --> 00:39:21.780]   which I have often received when I make a joke."
[00:39:21.780 --> 00:39:22.780]   I know.
[00:39:22.780 --> 00:39:26.780]   It's not really understood or they're being polite or maybe they'll free off his clothes.
[00:39:26.780 --> 00:39:27.780]   I don't know.
[00:39:27.780 --> 00:39:30.780]   There are ways you can sort of weasel.
[00:39:30.780 --> 00:39:36.780]   It's rare once or twice I have been in a position where I feel like I really have to know
[00:39:36.780 --> 00:39:38.780]   if X is true or Y is true.
[00:39:38.780 --> 00:39:41.780]   And if you're really, really clever and you have an opportunity,
[00:39:41.780 --> 00:39:44.780]   you might be able to just like super password.
[00:39:44.780 --> 00:39:51.780]   I'll ask him a series of questions other than the one question that's direct and get one fifth of the answer
[00:39:51.780 --> 00:39:54.780]   with each of these five questions and piece it together.
[00:39:54.780 --> 00:39:59.780]   But I was reading this article. I didn't see anything other than I made a joke
[00:39:59.780 --> 00:40:03.780]   and I got a nervous laugh and response and I don't know what that means.
[00:40:03.780 --> 00:40:08.780]   So you're taking, okay, so maybe I misread it because I'm taking that he got confirmation
[00:40:08.780 --> 00:40:12.780]   from a Zeiss employee that they're working with Apple.
[00:40:12.780 --> 00:40:16.780]   Do you think that the nervous smiles with the confirmation?
[00:40:16.780 --> 00:40:18.780]   No, I think he got separate confirmation.
[00:40:18.780 --> 00:40:22.780]   I'm saying that I was reading all I'm saying is I was reading that Facebook post
[00:40:22.780 --> 00:40:26.780]   and I didn't understand the nature of the confirmation.
[00:40:26.780 --> 00:40:30.780]   I don't know if he amended it or expanded it later on,
[00:40:30.780 --> 00:40:34.780]   but all I didn't see, I talked to someone from Zeiss and Zeiss confirmed this for me.
[00:40:34.780 --> 00:40:36.780]   I saw, I made it.
[00:40:36.780 --> 00:40:38.780]   So there's a subsequent post, which I'm showing.
[00:40:38.780 --> 00:40:42.780]   I don't know if you can see it on the screen. There's a subsequent post that does refer to the post you saw
[00:40:42.780 --> 00:40:46.780]   that he says a Zeiss employee confirmed the rumors.
[00:40:46.780 --> 00:40:51.780]   Well, and I think we should remember that the Zeiss market cap is about $3 billion,
[00:40:51.780 --> 00:40:53.780]   which is like a rounding error for Apple.
[00:40:53.780 --> 00:40:58.780]   If they really were getting close to something that was, which could be happening,
[00:40:58.780 --> 00:41:03.780]   you know, that Apple could write a check and absorb Zeiss.
[00:41:03.780 --> 00:41:05.780]   Probably even a foreign check.
[00:41:05.780 --> 00:41:11.780]   I think it's now accepted wisdom that Apple's next, one of Apple's next things is they are, right?
[00:41:11.780 --> 00:41:13.780]   I mean, Tim Cook said it several times.
[00:41:13.780 --> 00:41:16.780]   The interesting thing is that Scoble is incredibly interested in this,
[00:41:16.780 --> 00:41:19.780]   and for him, everything is going to be as a zebra.
[00:41:19.780 --> 00:41:21.780]   Zebra in Canada, a zebra in the US, I think.
[00:41:21.780 --> 00:41:22.780]   You say zebra?
[00:41:22.780 --> 00:41:24.780]   Zebra, zed, zebra.
[00:41:24.780 --> 00:41:25.780]   Yeah, those kind of, I don't know.
[00:41:25.780 --> 00:41:28.780]   Anyway, so everything he sees is going to be a zebra here.
[00:41:28.780 --> 00:41:29.780]   Okay.
[00:41:29.780 --> 00:41:31.780]   So, so you have to take that into account.
[00:41:31.780 --> 00:41:35.780]   I mean, last year in October, he had a story about the next iPhone being a see-through
[00:41:35.780 --> 00:41:38.780]   and going into a VR helmet so that you could watch super high quality.
[00:41:38.780 --> 00:41:41.780]   You know, and that's probably not on Apple's roadmap for this year.
[00:41:41.780 --> 00:41:45.780]   They may be exploring that technology, but, you know, they're exploring a ton of technology.
[00:41:45.780 --> 00:41:48.780]   Tim Cook's made it super clear that Apple's really interested in AR,
[00:41:48.780 --> 00:41:51.780]   but AR is sort of like a display.
[00:41:51.780 --> 00:41:56.780]   Everything we have now from Apple has an LCD or an LED or OLED display in it,
[00:41:56.780 --> 00:41:59.780]   but it's not a device that's designed to be that display.
[00:41:59.780 --> 00:42:03.780]   And I think we will see some prototypes from Apple, whether they ship or not, I don't know.
[00:42:03.780 --> 00:42:08.780]   But eventually AR is going to be a display layer that's going to manifest in a ton of products that Apple makes.
[00:42:08.780 --> 00:42:11.780]   And also, I think one of the things that's really hard for people to do,
[00:42:11.780 --> 00:42:15.780]   and I think we talked about it a little bit before, is the match moving of pixel data,
[00:42:15.780 --> 00:42:17.780]   which is going to make a huge difference.
[00:42:17.780 --> 00:42:23.780]   Right now we're really basing everything on a very rough approximation of the position of the camera.
[00:42:23.780 --> 00:42:28.780]   So that's why our Pokemon Go float, you know, little characters float over the bottom,
[00:42:28.780 --> 00:42:30.780]   is because we're not actually tracking.
[00:42:30.780 --> 00:42:33.780]   We're not saying, okay, we know 90% of this from the camera position,
[00:42:33.780 --> 00:42:38.780]   but what we want to do is look at all those pixels and make sure that whatever I place out there in that space
[00:42:38.780 --> 00:42:40.780]   will stick in 3D.
[00:42:40.780 --> 00:42:46.780]   And part of that actually is driven from the two lenses that are the two sensors now
[00:42:46.780 --> 00:42:51.780]   that the iPhone 7 Plus has makes that much of that calculation much easier.
[00:42:51.780 --> 00:42:56.780]   And then you have 2D tracking data, which then solves some of those other issues.
[00:42:56.780 --> 00:43:03.780]   So if you look at that camera is now able to give some rough rudimentary 3D data back to the camera.
[00:43:03.780 --> 00:43:11.780]   So while we're happy with the portrait mode, there is other things that those cameras can provide back to the camera.
[00:43:11.780 --> 00:43:15.780]   Right now, anybody who wants to do that has to write that from scratch.
[00:43:15.780 --> 00:43:17.780]   I'm going to take all that data and I'm going to figure it all out.
[00:43:17.780 --> 00:43:23.780]   What I think we're going to see sometime soon is Apple providing the first step for Apple to go into AR
[00:43:23.780 --> 00:43:30.780]   in my opinion would be for them to write libraries that are going to make that process easy for developers.
[00:43:30.780 --> 00:43:33.780]   So the developers aren't having to write that from scratch.
[00:43:33.780 --> 00:43:37.780]   It's like, here's our cameras, here's the data that it's grabbing, here's the match moving data.
[00:43:37.780 --> 00:43:40.780]   So if I want something to stick, I'm just going to say, you know, make sticky.
[00:43:40.780 --> 00:43:44.780]   You know, you know, like not, but not like I have to write all of this code and I have to go back to,
[00:43:44.780 --> 00:43:50.780]   you know, go back and read, you know, 10 years of C-GRAV to figure out how to make that work.
[00:43:50.780 --> 00:43:56.780]   And so I think that that's going to be, and I really believe that that'll be the first step that changes a lot of things
[00:43:56.780 --> 00:43:58.780]   because no one's doing that.
[00:43:58.780 --> 00:44:01.780]   That tracking is still something that is, you know, all that.
[00:44:01.780 --> 00:44:06.780]   Any time you see it floating, what they're not being able to do is basically derive the 3D information
[00:44:06.780 --> 00:44:11.780]   and derive 2D tracking information that's required.
[00:44:11.780 --> 00:44:16.780]   Yeah. Also, we have to remember that AR can also be just a software solution.
[00:44:16.780 --> 00:44:21.780]   I think when I see what Apple could do and their opportunities, I don't see them having a headset.
[00:44:21.780 --> 00:44:28.780]   I see them having a set of APIs and also augmenting their own internal, they're on in-house apps
[00:44:28.780 --> 00:44:33.780]   so that now Apple maps you hold it up and you just want to know where is the building I'm trying to find
[00:44:33.780 --> 00:44:40.780]   and it will simply put right here dummy or in five years time, again, not necessarily you're wearing a pair of glasses,
[00:44:40.780 --> 00:44:46.780]   you want to know where are the power lines or the weight bearing walls in my house,
[00:44:46.780 --> 00:44:50.780]   where are the power lines, where are the sewage lines, and be able to simply walk through your house
[00:44:50.780 --> 00:44:56.780]   and because you gave it access to your architectural data, it will simply give you X-ray vision through your walls
[00:44:56.780 --> 00:45:02.780]   so that I probably should not take my saws all to that part of the wall because I'm going to have white,
[00:45:02.780 --> 00:45:06.780]   I'll have gray water all over the master bedroom.
[00:45:06.780 --> 00:45:14.780]   But as to Zeiss, I don't think that they're a good acquisition target because they're not a company
[00:45:14.780 --> 00:45:18.780]   that has developed a multi-touch technology that they can buy and that integrate.
[00:45:18.780 --> 00:45:25.780]   They are everything that involves optics and vision, so it's camera lenses, it's microscope lenses,
[00:45:25.780 --> 00:45:29.780]   it's medical technology, it's manufacturing technology because so many of these automated systems,
[00:45:29.780 --> 00:45:34.780]   they need to be able to see carefully where is the hole that the screw needs to go into.
[00:45:34.780 --> 00:45:37.780]   Their portfolio is just huge, huge, huge, huge, huge.
[00:45:37.780 --> 00:45:40.780]   And if Apple were to acquire that, they would now either have to run that entire business
[00:45:40.780 --> 00:45:46.780]   or tell 80% of Zeiss' customers, well, good luck on that.
[00:45:46.780 --> 00:45:52.780]   The other scropic site that we're about to sell you, but we're not going to sell you anymore,
[00:45:52.780 --> 00:45:57.780]   I'm, you know what, the Civil War, they did not have any good lenses and people seem to live.
[00:45:57.780 --> 00:45:58.780]   That's okay.
[00:45:58.780 --> 00:46:00.780]   I don't think that's going to happen.
[00:46:00.780 --> 00:46:04.780]   I really like to see what they can do just with software and I think that's an area
[00:46:04.780 --> 00:46:06.780]   where Apple can really, really excel.
[00:46:06.780 --> 00:46:14.780]   Renee Ritchie in the "Sci, Just Sci" category takes down consumer reports they've admitted.
[00:46:14.780 --> 00:46:19.780]   Well, why don't you tell the story because I think you've got it here on iMOR today
[00:46:19.780 --> 00:46:22.780]   and in the chronological order.
[00:46:22.780 --> 00:46:26.780]   I could start by saying that made headlines last week when the consumer report said,
[00:46:26.780 --> 00:46:30.780]   "We're not going to recommend for the first time in years the new MacBook Pro
[00:46:30.780 --> 00:46:32.780]   because battery life is inconsistent."
[00:46:32.780 --> 00:46:36.780]   Apple responded immediately, "Well, we're not sure what they're doing.
[00:46:36.780 --> 00:46:37.780]   Their results don't match.
[00:46:37.780 --> 00:46:39.780]   Our results will get back to you."
[00:46:39.780 --> 00:46:40.780]   So take it from there.
[00:46:40.780 --> 00:46:44.780]   So the results were bewildering and I don't say that lightly.
[00:46:44.780 --> 00:46:50.780]   They were getting, in some cases, I think it was 14 to 18 hours in some tests and three in another.
[00:46:50.780 --> 00:46:55.780]   And if you've used a MacBook, anything in the 14 to 18 hour range should just set off
[00:46:55.780 --> 00:46:58.780]   tremendous big glowing red neon light bulbs.
[00:46:58.780 --> 00:47:02.780]   Because that's just, I think, beyond the laws of physics at this point.
[00:47:02.780 --> 00:47:05.780]   And likewise, anything that has that range of disparities,
[00:47:05.780 --> 00:47:09.780]   I mean, it's going from 18 to three hours in the same range of tests.
[00:47:09.780 --> 00:47:13.780]   As just someone who's done battery testing in the past would set off huge alarm bells with me
[00:47:13.780 --> 00:47:17.780]   and the old school IT guy and me would want to take apart every link in every chain
[00:47:17.780 --> 00:47:21.780]   and every part of that process to identify and isolate what was causing the variance
[00:47:21.780 --> 00:47:23.780]   and see if I could figure that out.
[00:47:23.780 --> 00:47:26.780]   But you can assign whatever you want to this.
[00:47:26.780 --> 00:47:27.780]   I have my own pet theories about it.
[00:47:27.780 --> 00:47:30.780]   But Consumer Reports decided to publish right before the holidays.
[00:47:30.780 --> 00:47:35.780]   And it made huge headlines because Consumer Reports for the first time didn't recommend a MacBook.
[00:47:35.780 --> 00:47:37.780]   It was their James Comey letter.
[00:47:37.780 --> 00:47:39.780]   It totally was.
[00:47:39.780 --> 00:47:43.780]   And the other part that was baffling was that their test showed that Chrome got significantly better
[00:47:43.780 --> 00:47:46.780]   or didn't have the problems with battery life that Safari has done.
[00:47:46.780 --> 00:47:48.780]   Which is not what anybody who uses it like experience.
[00:47:48.780 --> 00:47:52.780]   No other test has ever shown that usually it's about, I think, 10 to 15% battery life.
[00:47:52.780 --> 00:47:54.780]   It's about 15% battery life reduction when you use Chrome.
[00:47:54.780 --> 00:47:58.780]   Just because they're not using the CPU optimizations that Apple uses because they're a cross-platform browser.
[00:47:58.780 --> 00:48:02.780]   I mean, there was just a lot of things that were problematic with the report to the degree that
[00:48:02.780 --> 00:48:07.780]   I think a lot of people said that they would just never have published it in that state.
[00:48:07.780 --> 00:48:10.780]   Then there was a lot of back and forth people were looking into it.
[00:48:10.780 --> 00:48:12.780]   Eventually Apple and Consumer Reports got together.
[00:48:12.780 --> 00:48:18.780]   And it turns out that the test that Consumer Reports ran flagged a developer option to turn off the local cache.
[00:48:18.780 --> 00:48:21.780]   Which is not something that Apple sets by default.
[00:48:21.780 --> 00:48:25.780]   It's a couple layers hidden away and not a normal user would never use it.
[00:48:25.780 --> 00:48:31.780]   And was buggy in the version of Yosemite that shipped on the original, on those versions of the MacBook Pro.
[00:48:31.780 --> 00:48:35.780]   So when they fixed that, Consumer Reports is now retesting everything.
[00:48:35.780 --> 00:48:38.780]   But it made for a very interesting holiday season.
[00:48:38.780 --> 00:48:43.780]   So I guess it's, I mean, Consumer Reports defends the decision to turn off the cache saying,
[00:48:43.780 --> 00:48:46.780]   "Well, it's going to be a more reliable, I don't know why."
[00:48:46.780 --> 00:48:49.780]   You're right. It's not how consumers would normally use it.
[00:48:49.780 --> 00:48:53.780]   But then there was, it was further compounded by a bug.
[00:48:53.780 --> 00:48:55.780]   And Consumer Reports is focusing on the bug.
[00:48:55.780 --> 00:49:00.780]   And their press release is that Apple fixes bug uncovered by Consumer Reports testing.
[00:49:00.780 --> 00:49:06.780]   And Apple says, "Well, you guys didn't test for it. You did a stupid test."
[00:49:06.780 --> 00:49:09.780]   And they didn't say it quite like that.
[00:49:09.780 --> 00:49:13.780]   One of the problems the Internet has, and their community has in general, is that multiple things can be true.
[00:49:13.780 --> 00:49:14.780]   And we just like the state.
[00:49:14.780 --> 00:49:16.780]   Like these could be bad tests.
[00:49:16.780 --> 00:49:17.780]   And they're going to be bad batteries.
[00:49:17.780 --> 00:49:22.780]   So, I mean, that's both, but unless you can fix, make the test not bad, you can't really prove bad batteries.
[00:49:22.780 --> 00:49:25.780]   So to me, like you fix the test, then you have the discussion about the batteries.
[00:49:25.780 --> 00:49:28.780]   And if you can prove that they're bad, that has to be a big problem on Apple's radar.
[00:49:28.780 --> 00:49:33.780]   So Consumer Reports says they're going to retest with that box unchecked?
[00:49:33.780 --> 00:49:34.780]   Or what are they going to do?
[00:49:34.780 --> 00:49:37.780]   They're re- I believe they've got the fixed version of it.
[00:49:37.780 --> 00:49:38.780]   I don't know what they're going to do with their test.
[00:49:38.780 --> 00:49:41.780]   I mean, my ad-observity argument is you could turn off the browser and test,
[00:49:41.780 --> 00:49:43.780]   but there's nobody who's going to run a browser without the browser being on.
[00:49:43.780 --> 00:49:45.780]   So like you have to have some norms of testing.
[00:49:45.780 --> 00:49:50.780]   Otherwise, the degree of deviance becomes so high that it's really hard to control for anything in that stack.
[00:49:50.780 --> 00:49:51.780]   So they are looking at it.
[00:49:51.780 --> 00:49:58.780]   My problem is, you know, if I want to get into it, is that it's really hard to be relevant on the Internet now.
[00:49:58.780 --> 00:49:59.780]   There's so much competition.
[00:49:59.780 --> 00:50:01.780]   It's not the days where everyone bought the giant consumer reports,
[00:50:01.780 --> 00:50:03.780]   and that was the only source for buying recommendations.
[00:50:03.780 --> 00:50:07.780]   There's everything from Wirecutter to Sweet Home to CNET, to everything there.
[00:50:07.780 --> 00:50:08.780]   And it's really hard to get attention.
[00:50:08.780 --> 00:50:10.780]   And I think that CNET, sorry, sorry,
[00:50:10.780 --> 00:50:14.780]   consumer reports saw a lot of attention over the years with smartphones.
[00:50:14.780 --> 00:50:16.780]   And last year, it was Samsung's waterproofing.
[00:50:16.780 --> 00:50:19.780]   And the year before that, it was the bending of the iPhone.
[00:50:19.780 --> 00:50:25.780]   And I think the desire for relevancy sometimes overwhelms the traditional version of --
[00:50:25.780 --> 00:50:28.780]   because consumer reports has changed significantly over the last few years
[00:50:28.780 --> 00:50:29.780]   in the way that they do things.
[00:50:29.780 --> 00:50:33.780]   And I think the modern consumer reports was not well set up to handle this situation.
[00:50:33.780 --> 00:50:36.780]   I actually have never really trusted their tech reviews anyway.
[00:50:36.780 --> 00:50:40.780]   But I thought they had been getting better.
[00:50:40.780 --> 00:50:43.780]   And I'm a consumer reports subscriber and donor.
[00:50:43.780 --> 00:50:49.780]   And I certainly wouldn't dare buy a dishwasher or a car without at least consulting them first.
[00:50:49.780 --> 00:50:54.780]   But as you make an excellent point, there are also lots more sources for this kind of information,
[00:50:54.780 --> 00:50:56.780]   including Amazon reviews and so forth.
[00:50:56.780 --> 00:51:02.780]   And they're pitching me -- the kind of emails you get from these days are more sensational than I would expect from this.
[00:51:02.780 --> 00:51:03.780]   That's too bad.
[00:51:03.780 --> 00:51:04.780]   And the headlines they put on.
[00:51:04.780 --> 00:51:06.780]   It's like for the first time ever, Apple fails.
[00:51:06.780 --> 00:51:08.780]   It's not consumer reports to the tech's problems with the battery.
[00:51:08.780 --> 00:51:11.780]   It's the first time ever, it's Apple fails to get recommendation.
[00:51:11.780 --> 00:51:13.780]   I mean, that's their job.
[00:51:13.780 --> 00:51:15.780]   They obviously get attention and maintain their business.
[00:51:15.780 --> 00:51:17.780]   But sometimes that's at odds, but I want from them as a consumer.
[00:51:17.780 --> 00:51:19.780]   You're saying this was click bait?
[00:51:19.780 --> 00:51:22.780]   I think there was a -- I don't want to say it was click bait,
[00:51:22.780 --> 00:51:26.780]   but I think the tests were not run in an acceptable way.
[00:51:26.780 --> 00:51:28.780]   You were saying there was a little bit of a gotcha.
[00:51:28.780 --> 00:51:29.780]   Like a gotcha showed up.
[00:51:29.780 --> 00:51:31.780]   No, they thought that they could take advantage over.
[00:51:31.780 --> 00:51:32.780]   Yes.
[00:51:32.780 --> 00:51:33.780]   Well, you make a good point, though.
[00:51:33.780 --> 00:51:36.780]   You're an engineer and you see 18 hours and three hours in the same test.
[00:51:36.780 --> 00:51:39.780]   You don't just go, "Oh, there's something wrong."
[00:51:39.780 --> 00:51:40.780]   You say, "What?"
[00:51:40.780 --> 00:51:41.780]   What's going on here?
[00:51:41.780 --> 00:51:44.780]   Yeah, that's what I do when I'm doing testing.
[00:51:44.780 --> 00:51:53.780]   But it's -- I think that the consumer reports was undone a little bit about their -- by their
[00:51:53.780 --> 00:51:57.780]   Mr. Spock-style testing they tend to do with computers.
[00:51:57.780 --> 00:52:03.740]   If I don't like their reviews, it's not -- it's generally because they really like
[00:52:03.740 --> 00:52:08.740]   something that somebody with a clipboard can check off boxes and put numbers in boxes.
[00:52:08.740 --> 00:52:11.740]   When oftentimes it really is not something that's quantifiable.
[00:52:11.740 --> 00:52:16.740]   You really have to have a subjective experience that you can then explain that may be relevant
[00:52:16.740 --> 00:52:19.740]   or may not be relevant to each individual person.
[00:52:19.740 --> 00:52:23.740]   This is why I really love the Wirecutter and the Smart Home Reviews because they will say,
[00:52:23.740 --> 00:52:29.740]   "Here is our pick for the best -- here's our recommendation for an inexpensive 4K TV."
[00:52:29.740 --> 00:52:32.740]   But instead of saying, "Here are the tests we did, here are the graphs,
[00:52:32.740 --> 00:52:33.740]   here are the charts."
[00:52:33.740 --> 00:52:37.740]   It's an essay on, "Here is what we think is important.
[00:52:37.740 --> 00:52:40.740]   Here is what we think that a device like this should achieve.
[00:52:40.740 --> 00:52:43.740]   Here's how well each of these achieves it."
[00:52:43.740 --> 00:52:47.740]   And here is us being open-minded about, "Well, it doesn't achieve it, but it also does well in this sort of thing."
[00:52:47.740 --> 00:52:50.740]   It gives you the -- it gives the reader the ability to decide,
[00:52:50.740 --> 00:52:54.740]   "Well, I actually thought that their third best pick was the one for me because they explained
[00:52:54.740 --> 00:52:56.740]   the things they like about this are things that I would never use."
[00:52:56.740 --> 00:53:00.740]   And the thing that they really liked about the third pick is something that I really -- I love,
[00:53:00.740 --> 00:53:01.740]   and this is $200 less.
[00:53:01.740 --> 00:53:06.740]   Again, I think that Consumer Reports tends to want to say, "Okay, item number 12,
[00:53:06.740 --> 00:53:10.740]   is it possible to delete a file using just the keyboard with a Macintosh?"
[00:53:10.740 --> 00:53:17.740]   No, so that's minus 10 points, plus 10 points to the DOS 3.1 machine.
[00:53:17.740 --> 00:53:23.740]   But it's -- I will also -- but I will say in their defense that it's -- Apple sometimes puts --
[00:53:23.740 --> 00:53:26.740]   it gives you kind of a bit of a problem.
[00:53:26.740 --> 00:53:30.740]   Like, when you're trying to verify that this gets X hours of battery life
[00:53:30.740 --> 00:53:35.740]   and you say, "Well, I'm using Chrome and I'm getting about two hours less,"
[00:53:35.740 --> 00:53:41.740]   it puts you in the position of saying, "Should I then redo the test with Safari?
[00:53:41.740 --> 00:53:45.740]   Should -- is it relevant that I have to use a browser that I don't normally use?
[00:53:45.740 --> 00:53:49.740]   Is it important that -- okay, this is a battery hog, this is a memory hog,
[00:53:49.740 --> 00:53:53.740]   but it's also the browser I like to use and it's been approved for use with a Mac.
[00:53:53.740 --> 00:53:57.740]   Sometimes you -- this is why you really have to have that ongoing conversation with your readers
[00:53:57.740 --> 00:54:01.740]   saying that if I think that the battery life sucks, here is how I've been using it.
[00:54:01.740 --> 00:54:05.740]   Here is what I reasonably expect this battery life to be.
[00:54:05.740 --> 00:54:10.740]   And here are instances in which my -- you might have different results than I will have.
[00:54:10.740 --> 00:54:14.740]   Please make your own -- and in all -- in all the attempts you are just giving your own opinion
[00:54:14.740 --> 00:54:19.740]   and you're hoping to let people form their own opinions based on your own experiences.
[00:54:19.740 --> 00:54:23.740]   Well, also, as you point out, Renee, before they went to press,
[00:54:23.740 --> 00:54:26.740]   they just thought, "Well, let's try the same thing with Chrome."
[00:54:26.740 --> 00:54:30.740]   And they say, "We got consistently high battery life on all six runs."
[00:54:30.740 --> 00:54:34.740]   And that should have been kind of like, as you say, a red flag.
[00:54:34.740 --> 00:54:38.740]   I mean, okay, maybe there's more -- and they should have dug deeper.
[00:54:38.740 --> 00:54:42.740]   So, however, let me ask you the question, Renee.
[00:54:42.740 --> 00:54:47.740]   It is true that battery life is weirdly inconsistent on the MacBook Pro, isn't it?
[00:54:47.740 --> 00:54:48.740]   Is it not?
[00:54:48.740 --> 00:54:49.740]   Absolutely.
[00:54:49.740 --> 00:54:50.740]   Well, I mean, so I wouldn't say inconsistent.
[00:54:50.740 --> 00:54:52.740]   I would say people are not getting the battery life they were promised.
[00:54:52.740 --> 00:54:54.740]   And I think that's absolutely a problem.
[00:54:54.740 --> 00:54:58.740]   And I dislike when the discussion gets taken off that topic
[00:54:58.740 --> 00:55:02.740]   because of things like removing a battery meter or whether consumer reports did their tests right or wrong.
[00:55:02.740 --> 00:55:05.740]   In my perfect world, we would focus on the battery life issue.
[00:55:05.740 --> 00:55:06.740]   That would be the only thing disgusting.
[00:55:06.740 --> 00:55:09.740]   And if we're not getting absolutely the battery life that Apple promised us,
[00:55:09.740 --> 00:55:11.740]   we would keep holding them accountable for it.
[00:55:11.740 --> 00:55:15.740]   Well, it's complicated because most other companies lie about battery life were over-promised.
[00:55:15.740 --> 00:55:19.740]   So, I think as consumers we're all kind of going, "Well, you know."
[00:55:19.740 --> 00:55:24.740]   But I was, you know, when the MacBook Pro, the new MacBook Pro got two hours of battery life,
[00:55:24.740 --> 00:55:27.740]   which is pretty typically what it will get in normal use for me,
[00:55:27.740 --> 00:55:29.740]   it is a little disappointing.
[00:55:29.740 --> 00:55:30.740]   Well, that's outside.
[00:55:30.740 --> 00:55:34.740]   So, I mean, I have a couple, like one of my thoughts on this is that Apple in general,
[00:55:34.740 --> 00:55:36.740]   they updated their battery tests a few years ago,
[00:55:36.740 --> 00:55:40.740]   and they got much, most people will tell you they're the most accurate battery tests back then in the industry.
[00:55:40.740 --> 00:55:41.740]   But that's not now.
[00:55:41.740 --> 00:55:46.740]   Like, now we're playing Pokemon Go and using Snapchat and we're having GPS and screens on all the time.
[00:55:46.740 --> 00:55:48.740]   And our web pages are both humus of JavaScript.
[00:55:48.740 --> 00:55:51.740]   And it's not just you're reading your email and surfing the web.
[00:55:51.740 --> 00:55:54.740]   That's the inaccurate test of browser lifespan anymore.
[00:55:54.740 --> 00:55:56.740]   It's way more, it hits way harder than that.
[00:55:56.740 --> 00:55:59.740]   And it's the ultimate, your mileage may vary scenario.
[00:55:59.740 --> 00:56:01.740]   I mean, and it's true of phones too.
[00:56:01.740 --> 00:56:05.740]   I mean, and it's even true for the same person from day to day.
[00:56:05.740 --> 00:56:11.740]   So, because Apple is sticking, like, so the part that's curious to me is that Apple is absolutely sticking by their estimates.
[00:56:11.740 --> 00:56:15.740]   Like, they're saying that if you wait for like photo agent and spotlight index,
[00:56:15.740 --> 00:56:19.740]   or like everything that happens when you set up a new Mac, if you wait a couple days for that to pass,
[00:56:19.740 --> 00:56:22.740]   and then you go through what they consider to be a standard set of activities,
[00:56:22.740 --> 00:56:24.740]   you will get the battery life they promised.
[00:56:24.740 --> 00:56:25.740]   I get less than that.
[00:56:25.740 --> 00:56:27.740]   I get about eight hours instead of ten hours.
[00:56:27.740 --> 00:56:29.740]   I'd be thrilled with eight hours.
[00:56:29.740 --> 00:56:30.740]   I don't know what it is.
[00:56:30.740 --> 00:56:32.740]   It also depends on the configuration.
[00:56:32.740 --> 00:56:35.740]   Like, I'm using the i5 and I'm not, like, I don't use Chrome,
[00:56:35.740 --> 00:56:38.740]   so I get a lot more battery life than somebody using the i7 who's using Chrome,
[00:56:38.740 --> 00:56:42.740]   or who has a discrete graphics card and is hitting that discrete graphics card.
[00:56:42.740 --> 00:56:46.740]   I think I have an i7 with a discrete graphics card probably, and I do use Chrome.
[00:56:46.740 --> 00:56:51.740]   I guess I look at it like, oh, this is how much I have left.
[00:56:51.740 --> 00:56:55.740]   My battery is so far all over the place, because if you're using anything that really works,
[00:56:55.740 --> 00:56:57.740]   the computer, it's going to be nothing.
[00:56:57.740 --> 00:57:02.740]   If you use Hangouts, for instance, or Skype, on a battery,
[00:57:02.740 --> 00:57:06.740]   and it's going to be 45 minutes, or an hour without being plugged in.
[00:57:06.740 --> 00:57:10.740]   So, it just really depends on, I just don't care about the hours.
[00:57:10.740 --> 00:57:13.740]   I know either, because I've just used to it being all over the place,
[00:57:13.740 --> 00:57:16.740]   and different, I mean, I just go, well, I guess it's a pleasure.
[00:57:16.740 --> 00:57:18.740]   Learn helplessness, exactly.
[00:57:18.740 --> 00:57:23.740]   We're all abused users.
[00:57:23.740 --> 00:57:25.740]   At this point, it's like, well, there you go.
[00:57:25.740 --> 00:57:26.740]   What are you going to do?
[00:57:26.740 --> 00:57:31.740]   What it really is, is you're kind of hoping someday that you'll have this thing that just goes and goes and goes and goes and goes and goes and goes.
[00:57:31.740 --> 00:57:32.740]   You'll be so happy.
[00:57:32.740 --> 00:57:34.740]   It's plugging your fuel cell and come back next year.
[00:57:34.740 --> 00:57:35.740]   It just goes and goes and goes.
[00:57:35.740 --> 00:57:38.740]   I ordered, and I hope to get it in about a month,
[00:57:38.740 --> 00:57:42.740]   since the new Chromebook Plus from Google and Samsung.
[00:57:42.740 --> 00:57:48.740]   I feel like that's going to be something that's going to get really remarkable battery life.
[00:57:48.740 --> 00:57:51.740]   But it's easier to do that, because you can't run any other apps or not.
[00:57:51.740 --> 00:57:52.740]   Not from your ear yet.
[00:57:52.740 --> 00:57:56.740]   I noticed on the iPhone, I've been playing Field Runners Attack.
[00:57:56.740 --> 00:58:00.740]   That thing will kill, I mean, the battery life on my iPhone 7 Plus is amazing.
[00:58:00.740 --> 00:58:03.740]   But if I play Field Runners, it's like...
[00:58:03.740 --> 00:58:06.740]   It used to be if you ran Facebook, it would have the battery life.
[00:58:06.740 --> 00:58:08.740]   Now they're better, but Snapchat is horrible.
[00:58:08.740 --> 00:58:10.740]   It's so inconsistent.
[00:58:10.740 --> 00:58:12.740]   I don't think anybody's...
[00:58:12.740 --> 00:58:14.740]   I mean, I don't know.
[00:58:14.740 --> 00:58:18.740]   Anyway, they're going to retest and then probably end up recommending the MacBook Pro.
[00:58:18.740 --> 00:58:19.740]   There you go.
[00:58:19.740 --> 00:58:21.740]   There you have it.
[00:58:21.740 --> 00:58:31.740]   Good year, though, in many respects for iOS, particularly in the App Store, $28 billion year.
[00:58:31.740 --> 00:58:35.740]   This stack comes from Apple?
[00:58:35.740 --> 00:58:36.740]   Yep.
[00:58:36.740 --> 00:58:38.740]   So it's not one of those made-up stats.
[00:58:38.740 --> 00:58:43.740]   They had the biggest day ever on New Year, which surprised me, because usually Christmas is the biggest day,
[00:58:43.740 --> 00:58:46.740]   because everyone's gotten their new iPhones and iPads, they're busy downloading apps.
[00:58:46.740 --> 00:58:48.740]   How did it win the New Year's Day?
[00:58:48.740 --> 00:58:50.740]   $240 million on New Year's Day.
[00:58:50.740 --> 00:58:53.740]   And a lot of revenue from subscriptions now, too.
[00:58:53.740 --> 00:58:55.740]   Almost a quarter of a billion dollars.
[00:58:55.740 --> 00:58:56.740]   Wow.
[00:58:56.740 --> 00:59:00.740]   But as they tell you, that is Pokémon Go and Super Mario Run Money.
[00:59:00.740 --> 00:59:03.740]   That is not like PCalk and Prisma.
[00:59:03.740 --> 00:59:08.740]   Hey, you know, it's still pretty mind-boggling.
[00:59:08.740 --> 00:59:14.740]   And remember, when he shipped, when he announced the iPhone and shipped it in June of '20, 2007,
[00:59:14.740 --> 00:59:16.740]   there was no App Store on it.
[00:59:16.740 --> 00:59:18.740]   And he wanted 1% of the market.
[00:59:18.740 --> 00:59:20.740]   He would be happy with 1%.
[00:59:20.740 --> 00:59:24.740]   And if you think about the idea that we just said Pokémon Go and Super Mario Brothers,
[00:59:24.740 --> 00:59:27.740]   I mean, this is just such a massive gaming platform now.
[00:59:27.740 --> 00:59:28.740]   It is.
[00:59:28.740 --> 00:59:32.740]   Compared to a lot of the consoles and everything else, the idea that they can make hundreds of millions of dollars just like that.
[00:59:32.740 --> 00:59:34.740]   It was pretty amazing.
[00:59:34.740 --> 00:59:35.740]   Yeah.
[00:59:35.740 --> 00:59:39.740]   What was the record day for PlayStation 4 or Xbox One?
[00:59:39.740 --> 00:59:41.740]   I guarantee it wasn't 240 million dollars.
[00:59:41.740 --> 00:59:46.740]   Pokémon Go's record day was New Year's, which is no surprise because the App Store's record day was New Year's Day.
[00:59:46.740 --> 00:59:47.740]   Yeah.
[00:59:47.740 --> 00:59:48.740]   Right.
[00:59:48.740 --> 00:59:49.740]   Exactly.
[00:59:49.740 --> 00:59:50.740]   Let's see.
[00:59:50.740 --> 00:59:53.740]   Was there anything from CES about Apple that was worth looking at?
[00:59:53.740 --> 00:59:58.740]   MacRumors had a round-up of accessories.
[00:59:58.740 --> 01:00:01.740]   There's a big accessories pavilion, right?
[01:00:01.740 --> 01:00:02.740]   It's CES.
[01:00:02.740 --> 01:00:03.740]   Oh, yeah.
[01:00:03.740 --> 01:00:04.740]   In the North Hall, isn't it?
[01:00:04.740 --> 01:00:05.740]   Yeah.
[01:00:05.740 --> 01:00:06.740]   But in this case, what?
[01:00:06.740 --> 01:00:07.740]   Headphones?
[01:00:07.740 --> 01:00:09.740]   More home-based stuff?
[01:00:09.740 --> 01:00:10.740]   Home-cave.
[01:00:10.740 --> 01:00:11.740]   Yeah.
[01:00:11.740 --> 01:00:16.740]   I didn't notice anything that was remarkably pro-abolite at that show.
[01:00:16.740 --> 01:00:21.740]   The interesting thing is that I think that it'll be interesting to see how Apple pushes it.
[01:00:21.740 --> 01:00:26.740]   The one thing I did see at CES was, I mean, there is just such a huge push on home automation.
[01:00:26.740 --> 01:00:30.740]   The Internet of Things, I mean, we've been talking about it and it's been building up,
[01:00:30.740 --> 01:00:35.740]   but you could really feel it at CES of just everything is going to be automated.
[01:00:35.740 --> 01:00:40.740]   And everybody is now, those things that we keep on talking about pie in the sky,
[01:00:40.740 --> 01:00:42.740]   of everything from your toaster to your whatever.
[01:00:42.740 --> 01:00:48.740]   I mean, you're just seeing multiple griffon now, I think, as a toaster that touches your iPhone, which...
[01:00:48.740 --> 01:00:50.740]   Oh, that's interesting.
[01:00:50.740 --> 01:00:56.740]   No, but I was like, the fact that griffon was releasing toasters and coffee things, you know, was, you know,
[01:00:56.740 --> 01:00:59.740]   that you can just see this incredible move towards that process.
[01:00:59.740 --> 01:01:05.740]   And so, I mean, I think that Apple will either, their home kit really has to succeed over the next, I think,
[01:01:05.740 --> 01:01:09.740]   the next 12 to 18 months, or a lot of people are going to have put something in their house,
[01:01:09.740 --> 01:01:12.740]   those net-first-mover process.
[01:01:12.740 --> 01:01:14.740]   And so I think they got into it at the right time.
[01:01:14.740 --> 01:01:17.740]   I don't know if they're putting enough energy into it to make the turn.
[01:01:17.740 --> 01:01:23.740]   I think that, you know, obviously there's a lot of pressure from companies like Google and so on and so forth.
[01:01:23.740 --> 01:01:26.740]   Alexa was everywhere at CES, which was interesting.
[01:01:26.740 --> 01:01:31.740]   Well, and that's, yeah, I worry that Echo is kind of now starting to take over the world.
[01:01:31.740 --> 01:01:33.740]   Oh, and when my emergency alert...
[01:01:33.740 --> 01:01:35.740]   Are we having flooding?
[01:01:35.740 --> 01:01:36.740]   Yes.
[01:01:36.740 --> 01:01:37.740]   This is annoying.
[01:01:37.740 --> 01:01:38.740]   I wish I could turn that off.
[01:01:38.740 --> 01:01:40.740]   In the Bay Area, you're having flooding.
[01:01:40.740 --> 01:01:41.740]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:01:41.740 --> 01:01:45.740]   Well, I get Amber alerts from Southern California too.
[01:01:45.740 --> 01:01:47.740]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:01:47.740 --> 01:01:51.740]   I think for me that is so interesting about the voice assistant home automation market is how
[01:01:51.740 --> 01:01:53.740]   diametrically opposed it is.
[01:01:53.740 --> 01:01:58.740]   Like Amazon has this device that has seven beamforming speakers and it is the absolute best thing if you're in your house.
[01:01:58.740 --> 01:02:01.740]   But if you are down the street and you want to turn off your lights because you forgot them, you're stuck.
[01:02:01.740 --> 01:02:06.740]   Apple is great because you can just use your iPhone to do it, but then when you're in your house, it doesn't understand you half the time.
[01:02:06.740 --> 01:02:11.740]   Amazon is fantastic at having all these APIs and you could talk to them and do all these different services,
[01:02:11.740 --> 01:02:14.740]   but only if you speak French in a little bit of German, sorry, English in a little bit of German,
[01:02:14.740 --> 01:02:17.740]   if you're French or Chinese or something, totally not a service for you.
[01:02:17.740 --> 01:02:22.740]   Apple is good at multi-language and even multi-language in a sentence structure, but doesn't have all of services yet.
[01:02:22.740 --> 01:02:28.740]   I mean, it's like such a turbulent sort of up and down market right now, which is exciting, but also frustrating.
[01:02:28.740 --> 01:02:29.740]   Yeah.
[01:02:29.740 --> 01:02:30.740]   Yeah.
[01:02:30.740 --> 01:02:32.740]   By the way, I've now turned off my alerts.
[01:02:32.740 --> 01:02:34.740]   So if there's a flood, just let me know.
[01:02:34.740 --> 01:02:35.740]   Okay.
[01:02:35.740 --> 01:02:36.740]   Save Leo.
[01:02:36.740 --> 01:02:37.740]   Save Leo.
[01:02:37.740 --> 01:02:43.740]   What I'm amazed at is how quickly, you know, I didn't, you know, I got an elect.
[01:02:43.740 --> 01:02:50.740]   I got the, I guess I got the dot or whatever, and as well as the echo to test at the house,
[01:02:50.740 --> 01:02:58.740]   and then I got the Google Home, you know, in another room to, to, you know, dueling systems to see how they worked.
[01:02:58.740 --> 01:03:03.740]   And I was amazed that my kids, for some reason, just completely kind of gravitated towards the Google Home for what I know.
[01:03:03.740 --> 01:03:04.740]   Yeah.
[01:03:04.740 --> 01:03:09.740]   They just, for some reason, however they're talking to it, it reacts faster or better or more accurately.
[01:03:09.740 --> 01:03:12.740]   I don't know, but they don't really talk to Alexa at all.
[01:03:12.740 --> 01:03:14.740]   They just talk to Google Home.
[01:03:14.740 --> 01:03:19.740]   And, and the, but I was amazed at how quickly it's become part of their kind of daily routine.
[01:03:19.740 --> 01:03:24.740]   You know, like, I thought that it would be something goofy that I put in there and I, you know, call up songs,
[01:03:24.740 --> 01:03:26.740]   but my wife uses it all the time.
[01:03:26.740 --> 01:03:28.740]   My kids use it all the time.
[01:03:28.740 --> 01:03:33.740]   The, like, my father-in-law, you know, said he'd rather have, you know, one of those than the new iPhone.
[01:03:33.740 --> 01:03:38.740]   You know, I'm like, you know, you just, you know, it's just a thing that he's, you know, it's amazing how quickly that becomes part of your, your, your, your, your life.
[01:03:38.740 --> 01:03:42.740]   I have both Google Home and an echo in my bedroom.
[01:03:42.740 --> 01:03:51.740]   And I find that they're kind of fighting, they're kind of fighting it up between themselves because I try to remember, really, it's like having two personal assistants in the office.
[01:03:51.740 --> 01:03:56.740]   Because I know that, for instance, they do a lot of things that overlap oddly enough.
[01:03:56.740 --> 01:04:02.740]   Alexa is better at actually adding things to my Google calendar and my, my two-year list because there's a lot of stuff that hasn't hooked up yet.
[01:04:02.740 --> 01:04:06.740]   But I can ask Google Home some really complicated things.
[01:04:06.740 --> 01:04:10.740]   Like not, I don't have to say what is this, so-and-so's birthday.
[01:04:10.740 --> 01:04:14.740]   I can say how many years has it been since this person released a movie?
[01:04:14.740 --> 01:04:18.740]   Or, you know, what is the weight of 11.1 liters of motor oil?
[01:04:18.740 --> 01:04:22.740]   And it will tell me that would be about like 18 grams.
[01:04:22.740 --> 01:04:23.740]   Wow.
[01:04:23.740 --> 01:04:29.740]   I think that might be why Alexa works better for me because I kind of know how to ask questions.
[01:04:29.740 --> 01:04:34.740]   To a search engine and my kids just are much more natural about asking crazy things and so on and so forth.
[01:04:34.740 --> 01:04:36.740]   I think maybe that might be why it.
[01:04:36.740 --> 01:04:40.740]   Yeah, I mean, it's clear that Google Home is better at Googly kind of searches.
[01:04:40.740 --> 01:04:42.740]   It's knowledge base is much better.
[01:04:42.740 --> 01:04:47.740]   I use the echo probably more and I have more echoes all around the place, of course.
[01:04:47.740 --> 01:04:49.740]   And it was all over CES.
[01:04:49.740 --> 01:04:52.740]   I mean, there's an echo everywhere at CES.
[01:04:52.740 --> 01:04:57.740]   That was the only super interesting thing is that this year, Apple is going to ship more than ever.
[01:04:57.740 --> 01:05:02.740]   Super interesting is that this year, Apple is going to ship more Siri, Google is going to ship more Google Assistant.
[01:05:02.740 --> 01:05:04.740]   But Alexa is going to be on Huawei.
[01:05:04.740 --> 01:05:06.740]   Viv is going to be on Samsung.
[01:05:06.740 --> 01:05:09.740]   You'll be able to get three different Android phones with three different assistants on it.
[01:05:09.740 --> 01:05:13.740]   And then the Battle for the House continues because Xbox, Microsoft and Cortana are still there as well.
[01:05:13.740 --> 01:05:15.740]   So no easy answers.
[01:05:15.740 --> 01:05:18.740]   Let me just ask all of the panelists from now on.
[01:05:18.740 --> 01:05:21.740]   I have pledged not to say the A word anymore on our shows.
[01:05:21.740 --> 01:05:31.740]   And I'd ask you not to say the A-S-C words on any of our shows, C for Cortana, and just refer to it as echo.
[01:05:31.740 --> 01:05:39.740]   Now that doesn't solve the problem for the many people in our audience who after finally giving up that word ever going to stop saying the A word changed their trigger word to echo.
[01:05:39.740 --> 01:05:41.740]   Now they're going to be pissed.
[01:05:41.740 --> 01:05:43.740]   Did I just buy a lot of dollhouses?
[01:05:43.740 --> 01:05:45.740]   Yeah, you might have bought a lot of dollhouses.
[01:05:45.740 --> 01:05:48.740]   Somebody said we should just call it Amazon voice services.
[01:05:48.740 --> 01:05:50.740]   I think that's too many words.
[01:05:50.740 --> 01:05:52.740]   And what's interesting is it is the echo.
[01:05:52.740 --> 01:05:54.740]   The product is called the echo.
[01:05:54.740 --> 01:05:58.740]   But the personification of it is so important.
[01:05:58.740 --> 01:06:00.740]   Which is where by the way, that's a bet that Google has missed.
[01:06:00.740 --> 01:06:03.740]   There's no, it's just Google.
[01:06:03.740 --> 01:06:05.740]   Google doesn't believe in anthropomorphizing it.
[01:06:05.740 --> 01:06:06.740]   They want to make a Star Trek machine.
[01:06:06.740 --> 01:06:08.740]   They want to be computer.
[01:06:08.740 --> 01:06:10.740]   And it's a very conscious decision on their part.
[01:06:10.740 --> 01:06:11.740]   Interesting.
[01:06:11.740 --> 01:06:14.740]   I haven't spoken to them officially about talking to some engineers.
[01:06:14.740 --> 01:06:18.740]   They said that they really do believe that this should not be gender specific.
[01:06:18.740 --> 01:06:25.740]   It should be here is a device and you are allowed to have whatever sort of identity to it that you decide to have.
[01:06:25.740 --> 01:06:26.740]   I think they're wrong.
[01:06:26.740 --> 01:06:29.740]   And Apple wants to pick Starlight character that is funny and conversational.
[01:06:29.740 --> 01:06:30.740]   I think they're wrong.
[01:06:30.740 --> 01:06:32.740]   I think I like it personified.
[01:06:32.740 --> 01:06:33.740]   I don't want to be cutesy.
[01:06:33.740 --> 01:06:36.740]   There's a real, you know, there's an art to making this.
[01:06:36.740 --> 01:06:39.740]   And that's another thing you saw at CES is personified robots.
[01:06:39.740 --> 01:06:40.740]   Yeah.
[01:06:40.740 --> 01:06:41.740]   I think it's really--
[01:06:41.740 --> 01:06:43.740]   Your clowns are clown terrifying.
[01:06:43.740 --> 01:06:45.740]   No, they shouldn't be like clowns.
[01:06:45.740 --> 01:06:46.740]   That's the point is that there is a--
[01:06:46.740 --> 01:06:50.740]   You can make it appealing so there's no longer seems like a machine.
[01:06:50.740 --> 01:06:51.740]   I understand Google's point of view.
[01:06:51.740 --> 01:06:53.740]   We shouldn't have to purr-morp-ize machines.
[01:06:53.740 --> 01:06:57.740]   But in fact, we want to do that.
[01:06:57.740 --> 01:06:59.740]   So, you know, I think--
[01:06:59.740 --> 01:07:04.740]   Also, they don't like the inherent sexism of I'm going to have my sister who's going to be a woman.
[01:07:04.740 --> 01:07:06.740]   Well, then make it a man.
[01:07:06.740 --> 01:07:07.740]   I mean, Siri, you can make a man.
[01:07:07.740 --> 01:07:08.740]   Yeah.
[01:07:08.740 --> 01:07:11.740]   Well, it's default-emanded in England and several other countries.
[01:07:11.740 --> 01:07:12.740]   Yeah.
[01:07:12.740 --> 01:07:13.740]   You can't do that with Echo.
[01:07:13.740 --> 01:07:15.740]   Echo is always a lady named the A.
[01:07:15.740 --> 01:07:16.740]   Word.
[01:07:16.740 --> 01:07:20.740]   But I just-- I think personifying it helps for some reason.
[01:07:20.740 --> 01:07:21.740]   It makes it more--
[01:07:21.740 --> 01:07:22.740]   Makes it more relatable.
[01:07:22.740 --> 01:07:23.740]   Yeah.
[01:07:23.740 --> 01:07:26.740]   Our show today brought to you by FreshBooks.
[01:07:26.740 --> 01:07:34.740]   If you are in business for yourself or your small business, you know that counting is like the last thing you want to do unless you're an accountant.
[01:07:34.740 --> 01:07:43.740]   But for most of us, we wish we didn't have to do the paperwork, the invoices at the end of every month, the tax preparation, you know, in April or--
[01:07:43.740 --> 01:07:45.740]   When do you guys in Canada do it?
[01:07:45.740 --> 01:07:46.740]   Your taxes are due to--
[01:07:46.740 --> 01:07:47.740]   April?
[01:07:47.740 --> 01:07:47.740]   April?
[01:07:47.740 --> 01:07:48.740]   Okay.
[01:07:48.740 --> 01:07:49.740]   Yeah.
[01:07:49.740 --> 01:07:52.740]   I thought you had a month-- it's like Thanksgiving that you were a month earlier or later or something.
[01:07:52.740 --> 01:07:54.740]   No, end of April, yeah.
[01:07:54.740 --> 01:07:55.740]   No, no.
[01:07:55.740 --> 01:07:56.740]   We're April 15th.
[01:07:56.740 --> 01:07:57.740]   No, okay.
[01:07:57.740 --> 01:07:58.740]   So, yeah, we're end of April.
[01:07:58.740 --> 01:07:59.740]   You have a little extra time.
[01:07:59.740 --> 01:08:04.740]   In any event, FreshBooks is from Canada, but they don't care because they'll--
[01:08:04.740 --> 01:08:06.740]   They have-- you work in any currency you want.
[01:08:06.740 --> 01:08:12.740]   I build Canada with my-- you know, it was great because handling currencies, handling expenses,
[01:08:12.740 --> 01:08:16.740]   keeping track of how you're doing, you can go to the brand new FreshBooks dashboard.
[01:08:16.740 --> 01:08:18.740]   You'll love this, by the way, if you haven't seen it.
[01:08:18.740 --> 01:08:20.740]   And you'll know immediately how you're doing.
[01:08:20.740 --> 01:08:26.740]   What invoices have been paid, what invoices are outstanding, what your expenses have been, what your profit and loss is.
[01:08:26.740 --> 01:08:28.740]   You'll know if you're making money.
[01:08:28.740 --> 01:08:34.740]   You'd be amazed how many freelancers and, you know, small businesses don't even know if they're profitable until it comes to tax time.
[01:08:34.740 --> 01:08:36.740]   Oh, we made money or oh, we didn't make money.
[01:08:36.740 --> 01:08:39.740]   Well, now you'll know all the time.
[01:08:39.740 --> 01:08:40.740]   It really helps you do a better job.
[01:08:40.740 --> 01:08:44.740]   You'll also get paid faster because those invoices have a pay button on them.
[01:08:44.740 --> 01:08:47.740]   On average, 11 days faster.
[01:08:47.740 --> 01:08:49.740]   I'm telling you, this is the only way to do it.
[01:08:49.740 --> 01:08:56.740]   If you're running a business, do what I did back in 2004 when I was-- when I was just swamped by invoices,
[01:08:56.740 --> 01:09:00.740]   FreshBooks that will-- I attract time and hours in their app or on the website.
[01:09:00.740 --> 01:09:02.740]   They'll keep track of everything.
[01:09:02.740 --> 01:09:03.740]   The new dashboards, phenomenal.
[01:09:03.740 --> 01:09:05.740]   They've completely redesigned FreshBooks.
[01:09:05.740 --> 01:09:10.740]   And of course, you get it recounting reports like sales tax, summary, profit and loss,
[01:09:10.740 --> 01:09:14.740]   but you also get an easy way to digest real quickly how you're doing.
[01:09:14.740 --> 01:09:19.740]   Try it free for 30 days at freshbooks.com/macbreak.
[01:09:19.740 --> 01:09:24.740]   And in a Mac break weekly in the How Did You Hear About a Section, FreshBooks-- I love it.
[01:09:24.740 --> 01:09:26.740]   I can absolutely testify.
[01:09:26.740 --> 01:09:27.740]   It is great.
[01:09:27.740 --> 01:09:32.740]   FreshBooks.com/macbreak.
[01:09:32.740 --> 01:09:39.740]   Moving right along, Andy Inako from the Chicago Sun Times.
[01:09:39.740 --> 01:09:42.740]   Renee Ritchie from iMore.
[01:09:42.740 --> 01:09:47.740]   He's editorial director at Mobile Nations from the Pixelcore Alex Lindsay, who's run off for a moment.
[01:09:47.740 --> 01:09:50.740]   But he's left us a nice view of his microphone.
[01:09:50.740 --> 01:09:55.740]   I've been using the AirPods, loving them.
[01:09:55.740 --> 01:10:00.740]   I can wear them at bed at night and listen to a book and I can even put my head on the pillow and it works.
[01:10:00.740 --> 01:10:06.740]   I'm not crazy about the double tap activation for Siri, but in general, I really like these headphones.
[01:10:06.740 --> 01:10:15.740]   We did do an interview on Saturday on the screen savers with Kyle Weems of I Fix It, who they did a tear down.
[01:10:15.740 --> 01:10:17.740]   He said, "There's a lot of glue in here."
[01:10:17.740 --> 01:10:20.740]   Zero on the repairability scale.
[01:10:20.740 --> 01:10:24.740]   I mean, I wouldn't expect headphones or headphones to be--
[01:10:24.740 --> 01:10:25.740]   They're hard to make, turns out.
[01:10:25.740 --> 01:10:28.740]   Yeah, I wouldn't expect them to be repairable.
[01:10:28.740 --> 01:10:31.740]   One of the things he dinged Apple for, he said, "They're not only not repairable.
[01:10:31.740 --> 01:10:33.740]   I don't think they're recyclable."
[01:10:33.740 --> 01:10:36.740]   Kyle has been hard on Apple lately about recyclability.
[01:10:36.740 --> 01:10:38.740]   I don't know what to think.
[01:10:38.740 --> 01:10:41.740]   I think he's probably right that it is difficult to recycle.
[01:10:41.740 --> 01:10:50.740]   On the other hand, just today, Greenpeace declared Apple the greenest tech company for the third year in a row.
[01:10:50.740 --> 01:10:54.740]   I don't know if this may not refer to recyclability particularly.
[01:10:54.740 --> 01:11:02.740]   They grade them on clean energy, energy transparency, renewable energy commitment.
[01:11:02.740 --> 01:11:04.740]   That new campus is 100% renewable, right?
[01:11:04.740 --> 01:11:07.740]   Also, energy efficiency and mitigation.
[01:11:07.740 --> 01:11:14.740]   Renewable procurement, I'm not sure what that is, but they do give Apple an A in all of those categories and a B in advocacy.
[01:11:14.740 --> 01:11:16.740]   But that's better than anybody else.
[01:11:16.740 --> 01:11:18.740]   They don't mention recycling.
[01:11:18.740 --> 01:11:20.740]   So maybe that's why--
[01:11:20.740 --> 01:11:23.740]   Well, it's also, again, multiple truths.
[01:11:23.740 --> 01:11:31.740]   Apple could-- there could be certain products that are less recyclable than others, but in aggregate, they might be doing a very good job in terms of recyclability compared to what other people in that industry are doing.
[01:11:31.740 --> 01:11:34.740]   How easy to recycle are J-birds or how easy to recycle are the--
[01:11:34.740 --> 01:11:38.740]   Yeah, I'm sure no head earbuds are recyclable at all.
[01:11:38.740 --> 01:11:42.740]   And they're small enough that, "Well, okay, maybe we can tolerate the landfill."
[01:11:42.740 --> 01:11:46.740]   But, Kyle said, "Bye, something that's more recyclable, do not buy air pots."
[01:11:46.740 --> 01:11:47.740]   I'm not sure I'd agree with that.
[01:11:47.740 --> 01:11:49.740]   Well, yeah, I think they'll get there.
[01:11:49.740 --> 01:11:51.740]   You gotta give them a mulligan on that one.
[01:11:51.740 --> 01:12:00.740]   It's like, at some point, you got so-- you're lucky it fits in an ear, let alone that it's recyclable content.
[01:12:00.740 --> 01:12:15.740]   It's like, "Okay, I'm willing to accept that if we become 12 minutes close to Armageddon because of the waste created contributed by the airpods, I'm willing to die 18 minutes earlier than I might have."
[01:12:15.740 --> 01:12:17.740]   Well, thanks for doing that for us, Andy.
[01:12:17.740 --> 01:12:19.740]   I appreciate it.
[01:12:19.740 --> 01:12:24.740]   Well, none of that stuff used to be recyclable, and now we've got computers that are more recyclable, and we'll get there.
[01:12:24.740 --> 01:12:30.740]   But anything that's cutting edge is just such a hard-- and that's not an excuse, it's just a reality of the industry.
[01:12:30.740 --> 01:12:32.740]   It's not something that Apple has singled out for.
[01:12:32.740 --> 01:12:46.740]   Yeah, I'm more concerned about computers that you feel like you don't really own because you can't fix them yourself, you can't upgrade them yourself, you can't do anything, but take it back to the store and hope that they haven't been shown a training video through weeks.
[01:12:46.740 --> 01:13:03.740]   Earlier, saying, "Try to sell them a new machine. Tell them that it's because the first time that I needed to get a MacBook fix, and I was told that it was going to cost me $1,200 to fix a broken trackpad because that's integrated into the entire lower half of the machine."
[01:13:03.740 --> 01:13:13.740]   I said, "Oh, this is definitely not the outcome I was hoping for, and I'm going to-- I will simply buy a $30 mouse rather than $1,200 to have this thing."
[01:13:13.740 --> 01:13:20.740]   It's a big problem, too. I took my car, my car got hit badly at the airport, and the entire side was scratched because I was scared about car.
[01:13:20.740 --> 01:13:30.740]   I mean, it happens, but I took it in and they're like, "Well, it's not a separate panel anymore. This is exactly the entire side of the car, and it makes up all-- and it's going to cost over $1,000 to fix."
[01:13:30.740 --> 01:13:32.740]   And it was like very small thing.
[01:13:32.740 --> 01:13:40.740]   And it's just-- their argument is that they're making this stuff in a way that is more efficient at the beginning, but it offloads all the cost to you at the end.
[01:13:40.740 --> 01:13:41.740]   Yeah.
[01:13:41.740 --> 01:13:46.740]   So, Apple's new ad. I've seen it a few times. It promotes portrait mode.
[01:13:46.740 --> 01:13:54.740]   And I don't-- is this Greece? Where is this? It looks like Montenegro or Croatia. It's Greece.
[01:13:54.740 --> 01:13:58.740]   Okay, in the music is interesting, too. You're not going to hear any speech, but I'll describe it.
[01:13:58.740 --> 01:14:09.740]   It's a small town, and a young woman arrives with her rose gold iPhone 7. She takes a picture of her grandma at a cafe, shows her portrait mode.
[01:14:09.740 --> 01:14:16.740]   The grandma gets so excited. She says, "What a great photograph."
[01:14:16.740 --> 01:14:26.740]   Now, everybody wants the young lady to take their pictures, so she goes all over town, taking really, really good pictures.
[01:14:26.740 --> 01:14:36.740]   I loved all the images of this. I don't think-- yeah, they're-- I mean, obviously, professional did things, but-- and the lady's perfect.
[01:14:36.740 --> 01:14:43.740]   It's the golden hour. But nevertheless, is this Greek music? I don't--
[01:14:43.740 --> 01:14:50.740]   What was hilarious for me is that this exact thing happened to me. I had a bunch of family and friends and family over, and I took a photo of one of them, and then I had to take a photo of everyone.
[01:14:50.740 --> 01:14:55.740]   The part they don't show you in this commercial, though, is the worst part, where it's like, "Did you send the photos yet? Did you send them yet? Did you send them yet?
[01:14:55.740 --> 01:14:59.740]   Did you send them yet? I didn't get any of them yet. Where are the photos? Where's my photos? You didn't send my photos."
[01:14:59.740 --> 01:15:00.740]   That's funny.
[01:15:00.740 --> 01:15:17.740]   I had the exact same problem, Renee. Only it was with total strangers on Christmas Day. I was in New York City. I was taking pictures in front of the big, giant Christmas ornaments in front of Radio City Music Hall.
[01:15:17.740 --> 01:15:22.740]   And of course, so-- oh, here's a person, someone who's completely alone. He has nothing better to do.
[01:15:22.740 --> 01:15:32.740]   I was like a foreigner, like a foreign tourist. "Hey, well, can you take a picture?" That's fine. And so I take a picture and compose very well. He looks at it and then carted, like, shows it to someone else.
[01:15:32.740 --> 01:15:39.740]   And I didn't know he was with like 40 other family members. And the picture came out so well. Everybody wanted the pictures taken.
[01:15:39.740 --> 01:15:43.740]   And I was there for 15 minutes saying, "Oh, god, dang it."
[01:15:43.740 --> 01:15:47.740]   I don't know how to say "poole" in whatever language they're in.
[01:15:47.740 --> 01:15:53.740]   Now, I've had a kind of a similar problem. Every time I go to the pool now, people want me to put music on and dive off the high dive.
[01:15:53.740 --> 01:15:57.740]   Yeah. So infuriating. Thanks, Apple.
[01:15:57.740 --> 01:16:08.740]   Thanks, Apple. I kind of like that, too. Although I have to say, the music does not sound like that out of the iPhone speakers. I just want-- and I doubt you'd be able to hear it from the high dive. But it is a fun end.
[01:16:08.740 --> 01:16:14.740]   And nobody has any-- one thing you notice that nobody had any wisty hair. You know, like--
[01:16:14.740 --> 01:16:18.740]   Oh, yeah, and the portraits, stuff. Everybody looks beautiful. They don't have a look like Renee.
[01:16:18.740 --> 01:16:28.740]   The one thing is that my first test with my iPhone, when my daughter had come down from waking up and her hair was everywhere.
[01:16:28.740 --> 01:16:30.740]   It doesn't handle that very well.
[01:16:30.740 --> 01:16:33.740]   I'll just turn the music down while we continue to talk while we watch.
[01:16:33.740 --> 01:16:35.740]   And it was a little chunky.
[01:16:35.740 --> 01:16:39.740]   So portrait mode does not work perfectly all the time.
[01:16:39.740 --> 01:16:49.740]   Well, it's the function of what happens. You know, I think of how it's calculating that. It's not a large sensor.
[01:16:49.740 --> 01:16:50.740]   It's not a choice.
[01:16:50.740 --> 01:16:57.740]   Well, it's not doing what I thought it would be doing, which is taking two photos, one of the background out of focus and one of the foreground in focus.
[01:16:57.740 --> 01:17:02.740]   Why doesn't it do that? That would give you a real portrait mode, right?
[01:17:02.740 --> 01:17:07.740]   Well, the problem is it still needs that data to figure out where does it do that?
[01:17:07.740 --> 01:17:10.740]   When it comes in, it has to figure out where the foreground is.
[01:17:10.740 --> 01:17:14.740]   Yeah, that's more important. Blurring it, you know, the math behind it.
[01:17:14.740 --> 01:17:16.740]   Well, you don't have to. So here's what I would.
[01:17:16.740 --> 01:17:21.740]   So tell me why you don't. By the way, he just dived off the board and the music sounds great.
[01:17:21.740 --> 01:17:25.740]   That's why there was music.
[01:17:25.740 --> 01:17:28.740]   Why don't we? Okay, we got two lenses.
[01:17:28.740 --> 01:17:29.740]   Right.
[01:17:29.740 --> 01:17:35.740]   You're taking a picture. It focuses. It knows what you're taking a picture of. Why does it not take then?
[01:17:35.740 --> 01:17:38.740]   And out of focus picture is where that.
[01:17:38.740 --> 01:17:43.740]   It knows where that point is, or the set of points. It's a small number.
[01:17:43.740 --> 01:17:47.740]   That it knows exactly where those are. It still has to merge those two together.
[01:17:47.740 --> 01:17:52.740]   Well, no, but I'm saying it's not grabbing your whole face when it says it's something that's in focus.
[01:17:52.740 --> 01:17:55.740]   It's saying, I'm grabbing your forehead or your eye or your nose or whatever.
[01:17:55.740 --> 01:17:57.740]   I'm going to grab that and put that in.
[01:17:57.740 --> 01:18:02.740]   And then I'm going to focus on that distance and everything else kind of that is in that region goes into focus.
[01:18:02.740 --> 01:18:08.740]   But what it has to figure out is, I mean, calculating the lens blur is, you know, there's lens blur calculations that can be done.
[01:18:08.740 --> 01:18:11.740]   And so it's doing a realistic lens blur in the background.
[01:18:11.740 --> 01:18:16.740]   But why can't why I don't understand why it's not just having an out of focus second image.
[01:18:16.740 --> 01:18:21.740]   Because because the hard part is not the lens, the blur, it doesn't need to take a photo out of focus.
[01:18:21.740 --> 01:18:23.740]   It can do that on the tune of anyway.
[01:18:23.740 --> 01:18:31.740]   What it needs, you know, like what it needs is to figure out what is at that distance and where really where does it cut that edge out.
[01:18:31.740 --> 01:18:32.740]   Right.
[01:18:32.740 --> 01:18:38.740]   How does it know, in other words, what's the foreground and what's the multi layer to it's a multi multiple layers, not just foreground.
[01:18:38.740 --> 01:18:39.740]   But it's not just to.
[01:18:39.740 --> 01:18:44.740]   Yeah, it's grabbing a couple. It's grabbing. I don't know. I think from the demo, like a 10 sample.
[01:18:44.740 --> 01:18:45.740]   What really?
[01:18:45.740 --> 01:18:46.740]   Oh, wow.
[01:18:46.740 --> 01:18:56.740]   And so, and so it's grabbing that data, you know, in, and again, when we talk about AR, that data is going to be very useful in the future.
[01:18:56.740 --> 01:19:06.740]   You know, like that, you know, grabbing that data to figure out what portrait is. And I have a feeling that a lot of us are unwittingly guinea pigs and part of the R&D project.
[01:19:06.740 --> 01:19:08.740]   Well, they said that they said that we're training it.
[01:19:08.740 --> 01:19:09.740]   What?
[01:19:09.740 --> 01:19:09.740]   Yeah.
[01:19:09.740 --> 01:19:12.740]   They said that we're trained. We're helping train it right now in the beta process.
[01:19:12.740 --> 01:19:20.740]   We train that process on how it gets, it gets really good at figuring out that 3D data. But where it really has a problem is in calculating.
[01:19:20.740 --> 01:19:35.740]   That's why, like, if you have little hair, little bits of hair that are, you know, like messy hair or something blowing in the wind, you know, figuring out those every little hair and exactly where it is in 3D is not is is hard all the time and very hard to do, you know, in a calculation.
[01:19:35.740 --> 01:19:49.740]   So you'll notice that almost everybody, you know, has shorter cropped hair or they have, you know, the hair is pretty well, you know, maintained, not just lots of, you know, wisty, you know, and you'll see that if you take a picture, you'll see the before and after of the unfortunate mode.
[01:19:49.740 --> 01:19:53.740]   You'll kind of see, you can definitely see where it, you know, grabbed onto those things.
[01:19:53.740 --> 01:19:56.740]   And there's nothing reflective because it really struggles with reflection still.
[01:19:56.740 --> 01:20:03.740]   Getting back real quick to the AirPods. There was an app to help you find your missing AirPods, but it's gone.
[01:20:03.740 --> 01:20:04.740]   Yeah.
[01:20:04.740 --> 01:20:06.740]   Did it worse all that coming, right?
[01:20:06.740 --> 01:20:14.740]   Well, it worked ish. Like, it was trying to, there was a couple ways you can try to find an AirPod. One is using the Bluetooth connection to sort of figure out, try to figure out.
[01:20:14.740 --> 01:20:16.740]   And that was sort of what they were doing and it was unreliable.
[01:20:16.740 --> 01:20:20.740]   I just turned the music on really loud. And I can almost always figure it out. Yeah.
[01:20:20.740 --> 01:20:35.740]   Yeah. So this, I mean, this was hard not to see coming because it's a $4 app that uses Apple IP sort of willy nilly and is probably a feature that's on Apple's roadmap that if they killed when something else came out would get probably more outraged and killing it now.
[01:20:35.740 --> 01:20:38.740]   Right. And it didn't work that well, right?
[01:20:38.740 --> 01:20:48.740]   I mean, like Mac rumors had their own set of tests for I just find that anything that tries to detect based on, like you have to have a really sophisticated service with tight integration and the ability to control like with those Bluetooth dongles.
[01:20:48.740 --> 01:20:54.740]   Those companies have really good control over those dongles to help you find things like your keys and all those kind of things.
[01:20:54.740 --> 01:20:58.740]   They have no insight into where the AirPod actually is. Most they can try to determine the strength of signal.
[01:20:58.740 --> 01:20:59.740]   Right.
[01:20:59.740 --> 01:21:00.740]   Okay.
[01:21:00.740 --> 01:21:01.740]   So different floors.
[01:21:01.740 --> 01:21:06.740]   So we, there's no truth to the rumor that Apple just wanted to make an extra 69 bucks.
[01:21:06.740 --> 01:21:11.740]   No, I mean, they would much. No, they want you to buy another set of AirPods. They don't want to piss you off.
[01:21:11.740 --> 01:21:17.740]   Yeah. I think that's true. And they certainly don't want to have get the, get the reputation of, oh, they're easy to lose and hard to find.
[01:21:17.740 --> 01:21:23.740]   So yeah. And also, like, if this app doesn't work, like this hard to distinguish this from an Apple app, like some people just think this is the official find your AirPods.
[01:21:23.740 --> 01:21:25.740]   Yeah. Good point. Yeah.
[01:21:25.740 --> 01:21:27.740]   It doesn't work. It's frustrating.
[01:21:27.740 --> 01:21:28.740]   Yeah.
[01:21:28.740 --> 01:21:39.740]   Let's see. Foxconn says, yeah, we might replace all of our manufacturer employees with robots.
[01:21:39.740 --> 01:21:42.740]   So there's that.
[01:21:42.740 --> 01:21:44.740]   Also, first ever profit decline.
[01:21:44.740 --> 01:21:56.740]   Actually, let's talk about profit decline because Apple's apparently missed its, missed its annual operating goals and it hurt Tim Cook's bottom line.
[01:21:56.740 --> 01:21:59.740]   He got a 15% cut and his bone is crushed.
[01:21:59.740 --> 01:22:04.740]   He's giving it all away anyway. He's going to have to sell. He's going to have to sell a couple Teslas and.
[01:22:04.740 --> 01:22:13.740]   Yeah. He's making enough money. But still, that's a little, you know, I mean, people, this is, at this point, it's not, it's about keeping score, right?
[01:22:13.740 --> 01:22:19.740]   It's also nice to see this where some companies lose money and their executives get untold bonuses anyway. Yeah.
[01:22:19.740 --> 01:22:26.740]   Actually, Tim has compensated much more. I think we talked about this last week, much more poorly than some of the other.
[01:22:26.740 --> 01:22:30.740]   Exactly. Angela Arrens makes more than Tim Cook does.
[01:22:30.740 --> 01:22:35.740]   Well, they had to get her away from Burberry. They didn't have to get him away from, that would come back with a long time ago.
[01:22:35.740 --> 01:22:38.740]   Right. And again, he probably figures on making enough.
[01:22:38.740 --> 01:22:41.740]   He got a huge stock grant when he became CEO. Right.
[01:22:41.740 --> 01:22:54.740]   I think anyone who scales up way up over the holidays, according to slice, slice keeps track of deliveries.
[01:22:54.740 --> 01:23:00.740]   And according to Apple Watch deliveries, a huge spike over cyber weekend.
[01:23:00.740 --> 01:23:08.740]   And there's still a lot of stock. I mean, you still cannot go to a store and that's, I think, one of the most underreported supply problems of the year is that you just can't get Apple Watch to.
[01:23:08.740 --> 01:23:15.740]   57% increase year over year. That's got to be also the drop in price on the series one, right?
[01:23:15.740 --> 01:23:28.740]   There's that. I mean, there's a couple of things playing into this. And one is it's really odd to watch the smartwatch conversation right now because of delays with Android Wear and, you know, Motorola, me, beginning out of the business and which one getting sold to
[01:23:28.740 --> 01:23:32.740]   Yeah, pebble sold to Fitbit. It's not doing that well and blah blah blah.
[01:23:32.740 --> 01:23:37.740]   No. And the whole conversation was that smartwatches are doomed. Meanwhile, Apple Watch is like doing gangbusters and it's not even in stock.
[01:23:37.740 --> 01:23:42.740]   If they had actual stock of Apple Watch, too, they would have had much, much better results for this.
[01:23:42.740 --> 01:23:47.740]   I mean, it's that's sort of the tragedy of not having all those watches in the stores for the holidays.
[01:23:47.740 --> 01:23:51.740]   But like you said, the Apple Watch series one being cheaper, much easier to get into.
[01:23:51.740 --> 01:24:03.740]   And also, Apple's messaging was much better. It was much more focused on fitness and people understand that they understand the value prop and they're more likely to go in and maybe think about the Apple Watch one because it's cheaper and then maybe see the Nike version or one of the other versions
[01:24:03.740 --> 01:24:07.740]   and think it's prettier and get upsold. So there's a lot of upside for them this year.
[01:24:07.740 --> 01:24:12.740]   Just somebody called will play hockey and roller derby.
[01:24:12.740 --> 01:24:19.740]   No, she used the word hockey helmet because like that's what they use. She has a hockey helmet and a different helmet.
[01:24:19.740 --> 01:24:25.740]   But it's her roller derby helmet. It looks like R2 D2 because her roller derby name is R2 detonator.
[01:24:25.740 --> 01:24:32.740]   Yes. D2 Nator. Yeah. D2 Nator. And, yeah, sorry, that's better. And apparently she likes her earpuds because they fit right in.
[01:24:32.740 --> 01:24:35.740]   Right in and out like that. I hope she's amazing.
[01:24:35.740 --> 01:24:38.740]   They fit under a tuke. They fit under baseball. They're really good for.
[01:24:38.740 --> 01:24:42.740]   What happens when you talk to somebody and you're wearing a tuke? Does it block?
[01:24:42.740 --> 01:24:47.740]   It just covers the top and the antenna is broke down. Nice. And it keeps them from falling out.
[01:24:47.740 --> 01:24:52.740]   Yeah. The hoodie is harder because the hoodie can knock them out when you put it on or off.
[01:24:52.740 --> 01:24:54.740]   But the tuke is awesome.
[01:24:54.740 --> 01:25:00.740]   I actually like them surprisingly much. Not having a wire.
[01:25:00.740 --> 01:25:03.740]   All right. I admit it. It's kind of nice not to have wires.
[01:25:03.740 --> 01:25:07.740]   I went into Tim Hortons and there were two or three people wearing them.
[01:25:07.740 --> 01:25:10.740]   And then I went to IGA, which is our supermarket. And there were like two or three people wearing them there.
[01:25:10.740 --> 01:25:13.740]   That's more than I've seen people wearing smart watches.
[01:25:13.740 --> 01:25:16.740]   Yeah. Yeah. I mean, it's pricey. I understand and all that.
[01:25:16.740 --> 01:25:21.740]   But they're really kind of convenient. And I think we're going to get used to how they look.
[01:25:21.740 --> 01:25:24.740]   I don't think people are going to say a thing about it.
[01:25:24.740 --> 01:25:26.740]   I'll be like earbought earpods in a few years.
[01:25:26.740 --> 01:25:27.740]   Another thing.
[01:25:27.740 --> 01:25:32.740]   Well, and I think that we're in the same way that we have augmented reality for vision.
[01:25:32.740 --> 01:25:37.740]   I think that there's somewhere in the future there is augmented reality from a hearing perspective
[01:25:37.740 --> 01:25:40.740]   where we're going to have basically hearing aids that you can't see,
[01:25:40.740 --> 01:25:45.740]   like a phone app or whatever. And that's going to be totally integrated with our phone.
[01:25:45.740 --> 01:25:49.740]   And that's going to give us just tons of data all the time.
[01:25:49.740 --> 01:25:55.740]   And it's going to get to a point where if you think about about AR,
[01:25:55.740 --> 01:26:00.740]   you might even get into a situation where you have some glasses on that tell you,
[01:26:00.740 --> 01:26:02.740]   oh, that's, by the way, that's Leo.
[01:26:02.740 --> 01:26:04.740]   You know, like, you know, I know I want that.
[01:26:04.740 --> 01:26:06.740]   You find to have a whisper in my ear.
[01:26:06.740 --> 01:26:07.740]   Yeah.
[01:26:07.740 --> 01:26:10.740]   You know, and it's all in the post-ring. Leo's got, you know, Leo's two children.
[01:26:10.740 --> 01:26:12.740]   One named Abby. Yeah, exactly.
[01:26:12.740 --> 01:26:16.740]   He's kind of a dick. But other than that, you like it.
[01:26:16.740 --> 01:26:19.740]   And then you will know and you'll go, oh, hi, Leo. And you'll see it.
[01:26:19.740 --> 01:26:21.740]   Yeah, you're kind of a dick, but I like you.
[01:26:21.740 --> 01:26:23.740]   By the way, you're on a show with him.
[01:26:23.740 --> 01:26:25.740]   You know, remember to ask the other show.
[01:26:25.740 --> 01:26:27.740]   You may do the show. You may remember you did a show.
[01:26:27.740 --> 01:26:28.740]   Exactly.
[01:26:28.740 --> 01:26:31.740]   Yeah, I need that soon. I need that right away.
[01:26:31.740 --> 01:26:34.740]   I always imagine it with glasses, but I think you're right.
[01:26:34.740 --> 01:26:37.740]   I think the audio thing is even more fictitious.
[01:26:37.740 --> 01:26:41.740]   And all these people, all these people who did LASIK are going to be like,
[01:26:41.740 --> 01:26:44.740]   "Ah, you know, because I got all our glasses.
[01:26:44.740 --> 01:26:46.740]   I just got rid of my glasses."
[01:26:46.740 --> 01:26:50.740]   Because guys like us, we just, all we have to do is just get the prescription for the glasses.
[01:26:50.740 --> 01:26:53.740]   By the way, that's why I didn't get LASIK because the doctor said,
[01:26:53.740 --> 01:26:56.740]   "Oh, and by the way, you'll still have to wear glasses for reading."
[01:26:56.740 --> 01:26:57.740]   Right.
[01:26:57.740 --> 01:26:59.740]   And it was like, "Well, not going to do it."
[01:26:59.740 --> 01:27:03.740]   We've all commented LASIK. They'll do the LASIK and put the lens in your eye.
[01:27:03.740 --> 01:27:05.740]   That's what I mean.
[01:27:05.740 --> 01:27:07.740]   That's what I mean.
[01:27:07.740 --> 01:27:14.740]   LinkedIn has had to remove its Apple, its iOS app, and its Android app from the App Store.
[01:27:14.740 --> 01:27:19.740]   Actually, Apple had, I guess, taken out of the App Store there and go ahead and take it out of the App Store.
[01:27:19.740 --> 01:27:20.740]   I'm from China.
[01:27:20.740 --> 01:27:21.740]   In Russia.
[01:27:21.740 --> 01:27:23.740]   The New York Times in China.
[01:27:23.740 --> 01:27:25.740]   It's hard.
[01:27:25.740 --> 01:27:30.740]   It's a hard world to survive in these days if you're a multinational.
[01:27:30.740 --> 01:27:33.740]   Russia says, "We have a law that's..."
[01:27:33.740 --> 01:27:36.740]   Actually, this is not a bad law.
[01:27:36.740 --> 01:27:42.740]   If you take it in the right spirit, that data about Russian citizens has to be stored on servers in Russia,
[01:27:42.740 --> 01:27:44.740]   not somewhere else.
[01:27:44.740 --> 01:27:47.740]   Yeah, China had the same law and I think Apple had to localize.
[01:27:47.740 --> 01:27:48.740]   Apple had to localize the data there too.
[01:27:48.740 --> 01:27:49.740]   I don't know what to say.
[01:27:49.740 --> 01:27:56.740]   I mean, if you're in a country, of course, what we know is really what I think is Russia wants the access to the data.
[01:27:56.740 --> 01:27:59.740]   It's easier to do if it's a Russian server.
[01:27:59.740 --> 01:28:03.740]   What better access, by the way, than your LinkedIn connections?
[01:28:03.740 --> 01:28:09.740]   If you want to Negro, I mean, once a local data center and Albania wants a local data center.
[01:28:09.740 --> 01:28:11.740]   Well, but they get it.
[01:28:11.740 --> 01:28:14.740]   If you want to operate in a country, you've got to follow their laws, right?
[01:28:14.740 --> 01:28:18.740]   That's just the way it is, or you can move out of the country.
[01:28:18.740 --> 01:28:23.740]   Yeah, and that's what Google did when China said, "Hey, great, search engine.
[01:28:23.740 --> 01:28:24.740]   Everybody using it.
[01:28:24.740 --> 01:28:26.740]   We'd like it in..."
[01:28:26.740 --> 01:28:30.740]   And Google said, "Actually, no, we don't have to have any presence in your country.
[01:28:30.740 --> 01:28:36.740]   We can't rebuild our entire search engine to serve the needs of the state, and so therefore we're out."
[01:28:36.740 --> 01:28:39.740]   But that's not happening with these individual apps.
[01:28:39.740 --> 01:28:47.740]   And that's going to be an increasingly kind of sticky situation as the years go by.
[01:28:47.740 --> 01:28:52.740]   Because in the EU, there are a lot of regulations about here is what...
[01:28:52.740 --> 01:28:54.740]   Here's the data that you're allowed to retain.
[01:28:54.740 --> 01:28:57.740]   Here's how quickly you have to get released data.
[01:28:57.740 --> 01:28:58.740]   Here's what you should.
[01:28:58.740 --> 01:29:01.740]   If someone says that there's something on the internet that is not true,
[01:29:01.740 --> 01:29:04.740]   you're responsible for not leading people to that piece of data.
[01:29:04.740 --> 01:29:10.740]   It really is becoming a morass of individual little fiefdoms of rules.
[01:29:10.740 --> 01:29:18.740]   And then that's not even talking about the ways that this data can be abused by a nation that decides that it's done killing journalists
[01:29:18.740 --> 01:29:23.740]   and it would like to just kidnap them and interrogate them and also kill their friends
[01:29:23.740 --> 01:29:27.740]   and also kill their neighbors and also kill people they've been calling on the phone.
[01:29:27.740 --> 01:29:31.740]   So it's going to get worse before it gets better, I think.
[01:29:31.740 --> 01:29:36.740]   And Pokemon Go has been banned from the iPhone launch in China
[01:29:36.740 --> 01:29:40.740]   while state sensor evaluates security risks.
[01:29:40.740 --> 01:29:42.740]   -Kaman, don't know. All of us will, yes.
[01:29:42.740 --> 01:29:45.740]   [laughter]
[01:29:45.740 --> 01:29:47.740]   Are they worried that people are going to wander into the street?
[01:29:47.740 --> 01:29:50.740]   What are they worried about? Or is it the location data they're worried about?
[01:29:50.740 --> 01:29:53.740]   -It's location data. -Go ahead.
[01:29:53.740 --> 01:29:54.740]   -Go ahead.
[01:29:54.740 --> 01:29:55.740]   -I'll have to answer.
[01:29:55.740 --> 01:30:01.740]   Well, it's familiar to a lot of conversations I've had with people about Chinese censorship
[01:30:01.740 --> 01:30:07.740]   that one thing that is just the government is culturally worried about is
[01:30:07.740 --> 01:30:11.740]   anything that helps people to gather together in groups.
[01:30:11.740 --> 01:30:18.740]   So there's the classic example being a knitting group has been, was broken up
[01:30:18.740 --> 01:30:22.740]   because they were knitting dissent, but because it's a group of people
[01:30:22.740 --> 01:30:29.740]   that was basically getting together and forming some sort of a club among themselves
[01:30:29.740 --> 01:30:34.740]   that they really wanted to kind of stay ahead of and not really, not really encourage.
[01:30:34.740 --> 01:30:38.740]   So on that basis, the consistency of those conversations I've had,
[01:30:38.740 --> 01:30:44.740]   I'm not surprised that on top of whatever privacy concerns there are on top of whatever reasonable
[01:30:44.740 --> 01:30:49.740]   laws there are about the use of such apps, part of it is that this is an app that can use
[01:30:49.740 --> 01:30:54.740]   to create a mob in a certain place, and that's something that it's like,
[01:30:54.740 --> 01:31:00.740]   if your uncle was a former firefighter, he is going to yell at you
[01:31:00.740 --> 01:31:04.740]   if he visits you at the house and he sees that there's carpeting within four feet
[01:31:04.740 --> 01:31:09.740]   of electrical outlet because he is institutionally programmed to think that's a very bad thing.
[01:31:09.740 --> 01:31:13.740]   The Chinese government is institutionally programmed to think that anything that encourages
[01:31:13.740 --> 01:31:17.740]   and enables people to get together in groups is something that needs to be monitored closely
[01:31:17.740 --> 01:31:18.740]   at the very minimum.
[01:31:18.740 --> 01:31:21.740]   And it has been an issue in the past for them.
[01:31:21.740 --> 01:31:25.740]   So, you know, there was a, I don't know what year it was, but they said there was an estimated
[01:31:25.740 --> 01:31:29.740]   like 10,000 riots in China at one point in one year.
[01:31:29.740 --> 01:31:30.740]   Wow.
[01:31:30.740 --> 01:31:34.740]   You know, and you have a lot of very disparate groups that are all together
[01:31:34.740 --> 01:31:36.740]   and not all of them are doing great.
[01:31:36.740 --> 01:31:39.740]   And I know we don't have any experience with that.
[01:31:39.740 --> 01:31:41.740]   Nothing like that happens here.
[01:31:41.740 --> 01:31:45.740]   Right, so, but I think that there hasn't been a lot of outlets and when there was,
[01:31:45.740 --> 01:31:47.740]   well, do use these technologies.
[01:31:47.740 --> 01:31:51.740]   And I think that you only have to look at, you know, the Middle East and so on and so forth.
[01:31:51.740 --> 01:31:54.740]   See, you know, you can see why governments that especially that are a little bit,
[01:31:54.740 --> 01:31:59.740]   maybe a little bit more authoritarian and more centralized would be very concerned
[01:31:59.740 --> 01:32:02.740]   about people being able to sort that out.
[01:32:02.740 --> 01:32:06.740]   You know, you're something you don't want to see when you open your backpack.
[01:32:06.740 --> 01:32:10.740]   Stephen Frappier was at the, or Lauderdale airport during that.
[01:32:10.740 --> 01:32:13.740]   Well, it's better than the alternative.
[01:32:13.740 --> 01:32:16.740]   Yeah, during the horrific shooting of last week,
[01:32:16.740 --> 01:32:18.740]   he had his backpack flap was slightly open.
[01:32:18.740 --> 01:32:24.740]   It turned out he was shot in the back and the MacBook Pro in a backpack took the bullet
[01:32:24.740 --> 01:32:27.740]   and likely saved his life.
[01:32:27.740 --> 01:32:30.740]   The bullet ended up in the backpack's front pocket.
[01:32:30.740 --> 01:32:32.740]   Just sitting there.
[01:32:32.740 --> 01:32:33.740]   I only know what to Apple is.
[01:32:33.740 --> 01:32:35.740]   I would send him anyone like that would be good.
[01:32:35.740 --> 01:32:36.740]   Yes.
[01:32:36.740 --> 01:32:40.740]   And they would probably want to capture that data to see.
[01:32:40.740 --> 01:32:42.740]   What exactly happened?
[01:32:42.740 --> 01:32:44.740]   But then he'll hate the touch bar and it'll be bad publicity.
[01:32:44.740 --> 01:32:48.740]   How much how much how much thinner can we make this without costing people lives?
[01:32:48.740 --> 01:32:49.740]   Right.
[01:32:49.740 --> 01:32:51.740]   Well, here's here's a sad thing.
[01:32:51.740 --> 01:32:54.740]   This one actually had a mag safe port and it looks like an SD card.
[01:32:54.740 --> 01:32:57.740]   So I'm sad because that's that's worth keeping around.
[01:32:57.740 --> 01:32:58.740]   They still sell those.
[01:32:58.740 --> 01:32:59.740]   They still sell those.
[01:32:59.740 --> 01:33:00.740]   Oh, that's right.
[01:33:00.740 --> 01:33:01.740]   Do they still sell those?
[01:33:01.740 --> 01:33:04.740]   Yeah, you can get the last year as MacBook Pro 13 and 15 inch still.
[01:33:04.740 --> 01:33:05.740]   Is there a discount?
[01:33:05.740 --> 01:33:06.740]   They will.
[01:33:06.740 --> 01:33:08.740]   The new ones are more expensive.
[01:33:08.740 --> 01:33:11.740]   So relatively speaking.
[01:33:11.740 --> 01:33:13.340]   But no break.
[01:33:13.340 --> 01:33:16.740]   Let's take a break right now and your picks your tips.
[01:33:16.740 --> 01:33:21.260]   If Renee's got a really good one I mentioned on his website, but he's going to do another
[01:33:21.260 --> 01:33:22.260]   pick.
[01:33:22.260 --> 01:33:27.060]   But I will in conjunction with your pick mention a pick that you did on your website if that
[01:33:27.060 --> 01:33:28.940]   makes any sense at all.
[01:33:28.940 --> 01:33:29.940]   That's coming up.
[01:33:29.940 --> 01:33:31.860]   But first a word from zip recruiter.
[01:33:31.860 --> 01:33:35.820]   If you're the person in your neck of the woods, it does the hiring for your company maybe
[01:33:35.820 --> 01:33:40.220]   because you're the boss or because you're an HR just because you know the boss told
[01:33:40.220 --> 01:33:43.460]   you, hey, get somebody to fill that position.
[01:33:43.460 --> 01:33:45.700]   You got to know about zip recruiter.
[01:33:45.700 --> 01:33:48.980]   Zip recruiter really makes it possible to find the perfect employee.
[01:33:48.980 --> 01:33:53.820]   Let's just assume that the right person for that job opening is there somewhere out there.
[01:33:53.820 --> 01:33:54.820]   Looking.
[01:33:54.820 --> 01:33:56.340]   Let's hope looking, right?
[01:33:56.340 --> 01:33:57.340]   How do you find them?
[01:33:57.340 --> 01:34:00.900]   Well, you could just post on, you know, a job board and cross your fingers that that
[01:34:00.900 --> 01:34:07.700]   person looks at that job board or you go to zip recruiter and post there and to 200 plus,
[01:34:07.700 --> 01:34:14.220]   200 plus job boards, including social networks with one click of the mouse over that.
[01:34:14.220 --> 01:34:18.260]   That's a by the way used to be a hundred is now 200 job boards.
[01:34:18.260 --> 01:34:21.140]   This is a great time to go to zip recruiter.com.

[01:34:23.580 --> 01:34:24.580]   Don't freak out.
[01:34:24.580 --> 01:34:27.060]   It doesn't mean you're going to get all those resumes in your email or phone calls to your
[01:34:27.060 --> 01:34:33.060]   phone because everybody who applies who responds gets filtered into the zip recruiter interface,
[01:34:33.060 --> 01:34:37.180]   which allows you to screen them further with true false questions or essay questions, multiple

[01:34:51.260 --> 01:34:56.780]   A million businesses, excluding some very, very big businesses.

[01:35:17.420 --> 01:35:20.340]   Time for our picks of the week.
[01:35:20.340 --> 01:35:23.420]   I never start with Alex Lindsey.
[01:35:23.420 --> 01:35:26.020]   I think this time I'm going to start with you.
[01:35:26.020 --> 01:35:30.460]   If I pray you have something very expensive for us.
[01:35:30.460 --> 01:35:33.340]   Oh, no sound though.
[01:35:33.340 --> 01:35:35.620]   That's one thing we don't have from you.
[01:35:35.620 --> 01:35:36.860]   We have silence from Alex.
[01:35:36.860 --> 01:35:37.860]   Did you mean so?
[01:35:37.860 --> 01:35:40.260]   Sorry, I was grabbing my pick and I didn't want to make a bunch of wrestling during the
[01:35:40.260 --> 01:35:41.260]   wrestling.
[01:35:41.260 --> 01:35:42.260]   What did you get?
[01:35:42.260 --> 01:35:43.260]   No, it's not very big.
[01:35:43.260 --> 01:35:45.260]   It was just connected to things.
[01:35:45.260 --> 01:35:49.060]   So, this is a production recommendation.
[01:35:49.060 --> 01:35:52.580]   It's called an MDHX and it's made by a company called Decimator.
[01:35:52.580 --> 01:35:56.460]   Now, when these guys came out, they make a lot of converters that are similar to what
[01:35:56.460 --> 01:35:58.300]   Blackmagic Mags and AJA.
[01:35:58.300 --> 01:36:02.980]   When they came out, it was always these rough metal things.
[01:36:02.980 --> 01:36:06.460]   You were always kind of like, I don't know if that's actually going to work.
[01:36:06.460 --> 01:36:10.260]   Literally, when they came out, you see them at NAB and you're like, "It's like something
[01:36:10.260 --> 01:36:11.260]   Colleen put together.
[01:36:11.260 --> 01:36:12.260]   Is that what you're saying?"
[01:36:12.260 --> 01:36:14.260]   "Oh, right, you're in the shop.
[01:36:14.260 --> 01:36:16.860]   There's soldering iron and they're drill."
[01:36:16.860 --> 01:36:19.620]   Some kid welded this thing together.
[01:36:19.620 --> 01:36:23.700]   Anyway, but every year, they get more and more refined.
[01:36:23.700 --> 01:36:24.700]   This thing has...
[01:36:24.700 --> 01:36:25.700]   It looks nice.
[01:36:25.700 --> 01:36:26.980]   What does it do, though?
[01:36:26.980 --> 01:36:29.260]   Okay, so what this does is it's...
[01:36:29.260 --> 01:36:31.580]   I like it, but what the hell does it do?
[01:36:31.580 --> 01:36:35.660]   It's a cross-converter and scaler for HDMI and SDI.
[01:36:35.660 --> 01:36:37.620]   So, it is...
[01:36:37.620 --> 01:36:41.180]   I don't travel without one of these.
[01:36:41.180 --> 01:36:44.780]   So I have one of these in my bag all the time and it's like, "Oh, I need to connect
[01:36:44.780 --> 01:36:49.260]   an SDI signal to an HDMI monitor or I've got an HDMI output on my computer and I need
[01:36:49.260 --> 01:36:50.260]   to go SDI."
[01:36:50.260 --> 01:36:57.900]   Oh, and I also need to convert it from 1080p to 720p or 1080i to 720p or the other way
[01:36:57.900 --> 01:36:58.900]   around.
[01:36:58.900 --> 01:37:00.700]   All of those things it can do.
[01:37:00.700 --> 01:37:03.100]   It also does one to four distributions.
[01:37:03.100 --> 01:37:05.980]   So I got one SDI signal and I need to go to four other things.
[01:37:05.980 --> 01:37:10.420]   Oh, it sounds like something that I could see why you would use this then.
[01:37:10.420 --> 01:37:13.500]   As a production person, I don't know how many we have these.
[01:37:13.500 --> 01:37:16.820]   We probably have 20 or 30 of these at this point because they sit in our cases as these
[01:37:16.820 --> 01:37:18.860]   little pieces of glue.
[01:37:18.860 --> 01:37:21.900]   We try not to design around them, but they're like this little thing, "Oh, we need one more
[01:37:21.900 --> 01:37:26.900]   computer to go into the switcher or we need to figure out why it's not connected and everything
[01:37:26.900 --> 01:37:27.900]   else."
[01:37:27.900 --> 01:37:33.260]   So it is something that we use all the time on every project and I thought it would be
[01:37:33.260 --> 01:37:37.380]   worth mentioning it.
[01:37:37.380 --> 01:37:40.140]   It has a little interface so you can do everything from these little front buttons and it was
[01:37:40.140 --> 01:37:41.140]   funny.
[01:37:41.140 --> 01:37:44.740]   I use these little front buttons and there's this little LED thing that you get really good
[01:37:44.740 --> 01:37:45.740]   at going through to...
[01:37:45.740 --> 01:37:47.740]   I need this and this and you...
[01:37:47.740 --> 01:37:49.860]   It's funny, I was talking to the guys at the office and they were like, "I don't know
[01:37:49.860 --> 01:37:50.860]   how the LED works."
[01:37:50.860 --> 01:37:52.620]   I was like, "Well, how do you change it?"
[01:37:52.620 --> 01:37:59.180]   There's a little USB here, an old mini USB actually that'll pop up a webpage that you
[01:37:59.180 --> 01:38:01.180]   can make all the adjustments.
[01:38:01.180 --> 01:38:02.180]   And I was like, "There's a webpage?"
[01:38:02.180 --> 01:38:03.180]   You know, you're like, "This is like...
[01:38:03.180 --> 01:38:04.180]   It's pretty cool."
[01:38:04.180 --> 01:38:08.340]   I think for like four years, all I know is a little white buttons on the front.
[01:38:08.340 --> 01:38:11.580]   So there's a little webpage that you can configure these as well.
[01:38:11.580 --> 01:38:14.300]   Anyway, it's just a great little converter box.
[01:38:14.300 --> 01:38:18.220]   If you're a production person, you should put one of these in your cranky kit.
[01:38:18.220 --> 01:38:24.060]   So we buy HDMI converters because we convert the HDMI out of the cameras that we use.
[01:38:24.060 --> 01:38:27.580]   That's all they have for output to the SDI, which is serial digital interface that our
[01:38:27.580 --> 01:38:29.140]   TriCaster uses.
[01:38:29.140 --> 01:38:32.020]   But they're pretty much one way, one use devices.
[01:38:32.020 --> 01:38:36.620]   This is the same idea but it would go in both ways and could do scaling and all sorts
[01:38:36.620 --> 01:38:37.620]   of other stuff.
[01:38:37.620 --> 01:38:42.180]   Yeah, and sometimes you can find less expensive ways to go from HDMI to SDI for instance,
[01:38:42.180 --> 01:38:43.180]   that are only one way.
[01:38:43.180 --> 01:38:48.220]   But still at $300, this is a pretty good deal as far as all the things that it can do,
[01:38:48.220 --> 01:38:50.100]   you know, to get things in and out.
[01:38:50.100 --> 01:38:51.100]   And so it's...
[01:38:51.100 --> 01:38:53.100]   Anyway, we pack them with all kinds of stuff.
[01:38:53.100 --> 01:38:55.620]   It's very powerful little box.
[01:38:55.620 --> 01:38:56.620]   Very cute.
[01:38:56.620 --> 01:39:00.740]   And it's cool looking and it's got a great name, the decimate from decimate design.
[01:39:00.740 --> 01:39:03.060]   And they make lots of great things.
[01:39:03.060 --> 01:39:05.020]   This is the one that we probably use the most.
[01:39:05.020 --> 01:39:06.020]   Nice.
[01:39:06.020 --> 01:39:07.020]   MDHX 295.
[01:39:07.020 --> 01:39:11.180]   Andy and I co-pick of the week, sir.
[01:39:11.180 --> 01:39:12.540]   Coolest thing ever.
[01:39:12.540 --> 01:39:17.380]   It's the W3 Apple Watch Stand by Elago.
[01:39:17.380 --> 01:39:23.660]   It is a silicone molded model of a classic Macintosh that you fit in.
[01:39:23.660 --> 01:39:25.300]   Charging cable into...
[01:39:25.300 --> 01:39:30.660]   And then when you're charging it, the screen of the watch perfectly fits the screen of
[01:39:30.660 --> 01:39:31.660]   the little Mac.
[01:39:31.660 --> 01:39:32.660]   Oh my.
[01:39:32.660 --> 01:39:33.660]   It's nice damn mode.
[01:39:33.660 --> 01:39:38.020]   So basically you have this tiny, tiny, tiny little like Mac 128 that's showing you the
[01:39:38.020 --> 01:39:40.180]   time and the date while you're charging.
[01:39:40.180 --> 01:39:41.180]   14 damn dollars.
[01:39:41.180 --> 01:39:42.180]   Oh my God.
[01:39:42.180 --> 01:39:43.180]   Is this cool?
[01:39:43.180 --> 01:39:48.420]   I just want to buy 19 of them just to reflect how happy I am that they're making this.
[01:39:48.420 --> 01:39:49.860]   And it's so good.
[01:39:49.860 --> 01:39:52.500]   But I thought that was kind of cool when I first saw it.
[01:39:52.500 --> 01:39:54.820]   And then like, oh my God.
[01:39:54.820 --> 01:39:59.300]   Not only is there a three and a half inch disc slot, the disc slot has a manual eject
[01:39:59.300 --> 01:40:02.300]   hole for a bent paper clip.
[01:40:02.300 --> 01:40:04.140]   Oh my God.
[01:40:04.140 --> 01:40:09.180]   I'm like, Mr. or Mrs. or Ms. Elago.
[01:40:09.180 --> 01:40:11.540]   I need to bake you a Bundt cake or something.
[01:40:11.540 --> 01:40:12.820]   That is brilliant.
[01:40:12.820 --> 01:40:15.460]   This is pretty awesome.
[01:40:15.460 --> 01:40:19.100]   But it's in black or can I get it in a beige and apple?
[01:40:19.100 --> 01:40:21.980]   No, I think you should get it in beige or black.
[01:40:21.980 --> 01:40:24.220]   The rest of their stands look really nice too.
[01:40:24.220 --> 01:40:26.940]   But oh my goodness, you just have to get this.
[01:40:26.940 --> 01:40:29.180]   Oh, it's so cool.
[01:40:29.180 --> 01:40:30.180]   I would take...
[01:40:30.180 --> 01:40:37.540]   I'm going to take my watch out of my drawer just using it exclusively as a nightstand clock.
[01:40:37.540 --> 01:40:38.540]   Just to use this thing.
[01:40:38.540 --> 01:40:40.540]   You've got like two of them on order.
[01:40:40.540 --> 01:40:41.540]   Yeah.
[01:40:41.540 --> 01:40:42.540]   Brilliant.
[01:40:42.540 --> 01:40:46.740]   Renee Richie, pick of the week, sir.
[01:40:46.740 --> 01:40:51.740]   So mine is a little bit more expensive than the awesome, awesome Macintosh Apple Watch
[01:40:51.740 --> 01:40:52.740]   stand.
[01:40:52.740 --> 01:40:55.900]   It is the LG Ultra 5K display.
[01:40:55.900 --> 01:40:58.660]   I picked one up over the holidays.
[01:40:58.660 --> 01:41:01.340]   Because Apple didn't make, they did not make a 5K display.
[01:41:01.340 --> 01:41:05.940]   You can get a 5K iMac with a P3 color profile, but you cannot get a standalone display.
[01:41:05.940 --> 01:41:06.940]   Instead they punted to LG.
[01:41:06.940 --> 01:41:10.940]   Now they did a lot of the engineering work with LG so that it's all powered by one cable.
[01:41:10.940 --> 01:41:15.780]   You have a Thunderbolt 3 cable that goes from the Mac to the LG display and that provides
[01:41:15.780 --> 01:41:20.980]   power and all the bandwidth you need for 5K to get the image from your MacBook.
[01:41:20.980 --> 01:41:22.860]   A 13-inch MacBook can drive one of these.
[01:41:22.860 --> 01:41:24.540]   50-inch MacBook can drive two of them.
[01:41:24.540 --> 01:41:30.220]   So you could have 5 to 5K displays once sitting on either side of a 50-inch MacBook Pro, which
[01:41:30.220 --> 01:41:34.140]   I tried and is superfinely beautiful.
[01:41:34.140 --> 01:41:37.100]   The only problem is that it doesn't leave a lot of bandwidth left for anything else.
[01:41:37.100 --> 01:41:43.540]   So the only other port you get on it is 3x USB-C with a 5GB per second maximum.
[01:41:43.540 --> 01:41:47.260]   So it's not a powerhouse in terms of a hub, but you can still use your MacBook hubs if
[01:41:47.260 --> 01:41:48.260]   that's what you want to do.
[01:41:48.260 --> 01:41:51.180]   Like the hubs on the actual MacBook Pro itself.
[01:41:51.180 --> 01:41:52.740]   It's utilitarian in design.
[01:41:52.740 --> 01:41:57.180]   It is neither Apple's A game nor LG's A game when it comes to design it bothers me because
[01:41:57.180 --> 01:41:58.940]   it's what I look at all the time.
[01:41:58.940 --> 01:42:04.420]   I'm used to looking at a Thunderbolt or a NIMAC display and LG makes beautiful televisions
[01:42:04.420 --> 01:42:05.660]   and some beautiful displays.
[01:42:05.660 --> 01:42:09.660]   So I'm kind of cheesed off that for this, which is supposed to be a flagship display.
[01:42:09.660 --> 01:42:13.100]   It doesn't have that sort of sense of design, but it works once the screen is on.
[01:42:13.100 --> 01:42:15.300]   You sort of ignore everything else about it.
[01:42:15.300 --> 01:42:19.620]   It's not as glossy as an Apple display, which some people really like, but I find because
[01:42:19.620 --> 01:42:23.460]   I have the MacBook open and I'm using both screens, the difference a little bit bothers
[01:42:23.460 --> 01:42:25.340]   me, especially is seen from an angle.
[01:42:25.340 --> 01:42:27.740]   It just seems a little bit more muted on the LG display.
[01:42:27.740 --> 01:42:28.740]   So I see actually.
[01:42:28.740 --> 01:42:31.860]   Yeah, but the color profile is fantastic.
[01:42:31.860 --> 01:42:34.820]   Some people have complained that they've had to recalibrate them, but mine both came
[01:42:34.820 --> 01:42:35.820]   identical.
[01:42:35.820 --> 01:42:40.060]   And as far as I can tell, they're identical to my iMac and to my MacBook Pro.
[01:42:40.060 --> 01:42:41.380]   And just the reds are gorgeous.
[01:42:41.380 --> 01:42:43.820]   The greens are so beautiful, are deep.
[01:42:43.820 --> 01:42:46.700]   The purples of the oranges, they're fantastic looking.
[01:42:46.700 --> 01:42:47.700]   I set them up.
[01:42:47.700 --> 01:42:49.820]   I tried both on one computer at first.
[01:42:49.820 --> 01:42:53.580]   Now I've got one here in front of me and I've got one in my office, thumb office, sorry,
[01:42:53.580 --> 01:42:54.580]   my living room.
[01:42:54.580 --> 01:42:58.140]   I can just take the MacBook from one plug it into the other and keep working.
[01:42:58.140 --> 01:43:03.260]   And it's like having two basically two workstations that I can easily move the same computer between.
[01:43:03.260 --> 01:43:06.860]   So I really am sad that doesn't have the level of design that I'm used to, especially
[01:43:06.860 --> 01:43:07.860]   if I'm paying it.
[01:43:07.860 --> 01:43:11.580]   If there's anything that you can do with, you can charge Apple customers a premium for
[01:43:11.580 --> 01:43:12.580]   a display and they will pay it.
[01:43:12.580 --> 01:43:15.700]   Like if there's one place you can get away with it, it's doing it here and they didn't
[01:43:15.700 --> 01:43:16.700]   do it.
[01:43:16.700 --> 01:43:20.420]   So I'm disappointed with that, but functionality wise, it's a good display.
[01:43:20.420 --> 01:43:21.420]   Good.
[01:43:21.420 --> 01:43:22.820]   Well, I can live with that.
[01:43:22.820 --> 01:43:27.060]   I'd like it to look nice, but I mean, as long as the image quality is good.
[01:43:27.060 --> 01:43:29.020]   Yeah, which quality is very good.
[01:43:29.020 --> 01:43:34.980]   And Renee recommends some downloadable wallpaper for your new 5K display or not or for your
[01:43:34.980 --> 01:43:35.980]   iPad or your iPhone.
[01:43:35.980 --> 01:43:36.980]   I love this.
[01:43:36.980 --> 01:43:42.860]   This is to celebrate Chinese New Year's or Nian Hwa.
[01:43:42.860 --> 01:43:49.820]   And they're beautiful wallpapers from artists done on, I presume done on Apple products,
[01:43:49.820 --> 01:43:50.820]   right?
[01:43:50.820 --> 01:43:51.820]   I believe so.
[01:43:51.820 --> 01:43:55.700]   It was funny, if you go to iMessage right now and you type in Happy Chinese New Year,
[01:43:55.700 --> 01:44:00.060]   you'll get the celebration animation, a red bubble with a gold writing in it.
[01:44:00.060 --> 01:44:03.460]   Oh, it's early, but Apple's all in on Chinese New Year.
[01:44:03.460 --> 01:44:04.980]   It's not until next month, right?
[01:44:04.980 --> 01:44:07.060]   Yeah, I think it's 18 days from now.
[01:44:07.060 --> 01:44:10.020]   I mean, you can start saying ganxi flat-side, but it'll be a little bit early.
[01:44:10.020 --> 01:44:15.700]   So if I go into messages and I send a message that says what, Happy Chinese New Year.
[01:44:15.700 --> 01:44:16.700]   Yeah.
[01:44:16.700 --> 01:44:17.700]   Oh, I'm going to try that.
[01:44:17.700 --> 01:44:18.700]   Happy?
[01:44:18.700 --> 01:44:19.860]   And I don't have to do anything else.
[01:44:19.860 --> 01:44:21.340]   It will automatically do it.
[01:44:21.340 --> 01:44:24.500]   Yeah, I don't have to heart long press or anything.
[01:44:24.500 --> 01:44:27.940]   Happy Chinese New Year sending this to my mother.
[01:44:27.940 --> 01:44:29.260]   Okay, let's see.
[01:44:29.260 --> 01:44:30.420]   Could you have the over the shoulder shot?
[01:44:30.420 --> 01:44:31.540]   Because I really want to see this.
[01:44:31.540 --> 01:44:32.540]   Here we go.
[01:44:32.540 --> 01:44:35.220]   Let me do it to my mother.
[01:44:35.220 --> 01:44:37.180]   Oh, look, fireworks.
[01:44:37.180 --> 01:44:39.340]   Oh, I love that.
[01:44:39.340 --> 01:44:41.820]   And red is prosperity and red is luck.
[01:44:41.820 --> 01:44:42.820]   So it has the color.
[01:44:42.820 --> 01:44:44.500]   It's really nice.
[01:44:44.500 --> 01:44:47.420]   And then you can also get this beautiful wallpaper.
[01:44:47.420 --> 01:44:51.180]   Is this, does Apple, I've never seen Apple do downloadable wallpaper before?
[01:44:51.180 --> 01:44:52.180]   They do downloadable wallpaper.
[01:44:52.180 --> 01:44:53.180]   No.
[01:44:53.180 --> 01:44:54.180]   And they've done things before.
[01:44:54.180 --> 01:44:57.420]   They have special bags in Japan and they do do things for Chinese New Year because it's
[01:44:57.420 --> 01:44:58.420]   a huge market for them.
[01:44:58.420 --> 01:45:01.180]   But I think they're starting to do even more things along that type now.
[01:45:01.180 --> 01:45:03.300]   Oh, I hope they do it for other markets too.
[01:45:03.300 --> 01:45:05.380]   I love this.
[01:45:05.380 --> 01:45:07.980]   You know, wallpaper is one of the things that's really great.
[01:45:07.980 --> 01:45:12.060]   And they have, I guess this will work on iPad as well and iPhone as well.
[01:45:12.060 --> 01:45:13.060]   Yeah.
[01:45:13.060 --> 01:45:15.620]   I mean, they did the Thanksgiving challenge for North America on the Apple Watch.
[01:45:15.620 --> 01:45:19.300]   So they are trying to, and they did a New Year's challenge for everybody around the world.
[01:45:19.300 --> 01:45:24.340]   If you fill up your rings every day for a full week Monday to Sunday, I believe it is,
[01:45:24.340 --> 01:45:26.980]   you'll get a special award for the New Year from Apple Watch.
[01:45:26.980 --> 01:45:31.940]   And they're trying to do things that are both sort of fun, but have some value for people.
[01:45:31.940 --> 01:45:32.940]   Nice.
[01:45:32.940 --> 01:45:38.100]   Google Apple made in CNY, made in CNY.
[01:45:38.100 --> 01:45:40.900]   And you can find their special page at apple.com.
[01:45:40.900 --> 01:45:45.140]   It's from the Hong Kong Apple.com site.
[01:45:45.140 --> 01:45:47.700]   And there's some really beautiful images.
[01:45:47.700 --> 01:45:51.380]   And if you're not celebrating Chinese New Year, they're really great.
[01:45:51.380 --> 01:45:52.780]   I love the fish.
[01:45:52.780 --> 01:45:54.020]   It's nice.
[01:45:54.020 --> 01:45:55.020]   Yeah.
[01:45:55.020 --> 01:45:56.020]   Fortune flows.
[01:45:56.020 --> 01:46:00.020]   Ladies and gentlemen, the time has come to say goodbye to all the family.
[01:46:00.020 --> 01:46:04.940]   Renee Richie, who's a chief Mascatier at Mobile Nations.
[01:46:04.940 --> 01:46:10.940]   He's also a regular imore.com and on his own imore podcast, including Apple Talk.
[01:46:10.940 --> 01:46:13.980]   You'll find that at imore.com as well.
[01:46:13.980 --> 01:46:14.980]   Thank you.
[01:46:14.980 --> 01:46:16.980]   Oh, and we finally, we had a long delay because of some issues.
[01:46:16.980 --> 01:46:21.820]   We finally published the last for now, debug episode, which has Alita Palatana, who used
[01:46:21.820 --> 01:46:23.620]   to be experience lead for a series.
[01:46:23.620 --> 01:46:28.180]   So she did everything from how the verbosity of Siri on CarPlay versus television versus
[01:46:28.180 --> 01:46:29.180]   phone.
[01:46:29.180 --> 01:46:32.460]   And Linda Dawn, who worked on the Apple Pencil project, was doing prototyping for that.
[01:46:32.460 --> 01:46:33.460]   And it's fascinating.
[01:46:33.460 --> 01:46:34.460]   Wow.
[01:46:34.460 --> 01:46:35.460]   I'm excited to those.
[01:46:35.460 --> 01:46:36.460]   You get some good people.
[01:46:36.460 --> 01:46:37.460]   That's awesome.
[01:46:37.460 --> 01:46:42.500]   Just go to imore.com and in the left hand menu, check podcasts.
[01:46:42.500 --> 01:46:46.900]   And that'll pull you up the podcast page from imore and some lot of good stuff.
[01:46:46.900 --> 01:46:52.700]   Andy and I go at the Chicago Sun times.
[01:46:52.700 --> 01:46:54.180]   Hello.
[01:46:54.180 --> 01:46:56.540]   What's your favorite diner?
[01:46:56.540 --> 01:47:03.580]   Oh, whichever one is open after two p.m.
[01:47:03.580 --> 01:47:08.620]   Because it's a bit of a struggle to all the diners are breakfast and lunch.
[01:47:08.620 --> 01:47:11.500]   And the ones that stay opened until four tend to go out of business.
[01:47:11.500 --> 01:47:13.380]   But yeah, that's okay.
[01:47:13.380 --> 01:47:18.900]   Although, I will say that if you're in Boston, there is a 24 hour diner, like two blocks
[01:47:18.900 --> 01:47:23.780]   away from South Station, the main train station home.
[01:47:23.780 --> 01:47:27.900]   And so there many has been the time where I've thought that, you know, my train is coming.
[01:47:27.900 --> 01:47:34.580]   It's at seven, 10, or I could have like dinner at the diner that has those really nice like
[01:47:34.580 --> 01:47:39.180]   casserole blueberry pies at the end and take the 10 20 p.m. train.
[01:47:39.180 --> 01:47:40.580]   And I will take the 10 20.
[01:47:40.580 --> 01:47:42.580]   Take the 10 20.
[01:47:42.580 --> 01:47:47.540]   You can find his work at the Chicago Sun times and of course on the website, C W O B dot com.
[01:47:47.540 --> 01:47:55.460]   He's I H N A T K O on the Twitter and he's Andy I on the flicker.
[01:47:55.460 --> 01:47:57.100]   I'm also an octagon Instagram.
[01:47:57.100 --> 01:47:58.300]   Oh, Instagram to you.
[01:47:58.300 --> 01:47:59.300]   Great pictures.
[01:47:59.300 --> 01:48:00.300]   Instagram.
[01:48:00.300 --> 01:48:04.700]   Thanks so much to Alex Lindsey, who will be traveling abroad soon.
[01:48:04.700 --> 01:48:09.260]   Yes, I got a couple of weeks of bouncing around the world, little in Europe, little
[01:48:09.260 --> 01:48:15.420]   Southeast Asia. So I'm going to try to get a hotel at both of those locations that I
[01:48:15.420 --> 01:48:16.740]   can that I can get to.
[01:48:16.740 --> 01:48:18.340]   So that would be fun to have you on.
[01:48:18.340 --> 01:48:19.340]   All right.
[01:48:19.340 --> 01:48:20.340]   Yeah.
[01:48:20.340 --> 01:48:21.340]   So I'm going from very cold to very hot.
[01:48:21.340 --> 01:48:22.940]   So look for see how that I might be a little sniffly.
[01:48:22.940 --> 01:48:23.940]   It's very hot.
[01:48:23.940 --> 01:48:28.420]   I at Alex Lindsey on Twitter, L I N D S A Y.
[01:48:28.420 --> 01:48:33.780]   And by the way, we I tried something this morning before the show called a pixel core
[01:48:33.780 --> 01:48:34.780]   text session.
[01:48:34.780 --> 01:48:38.860]   If you go up to Twitter, you'll see links to it in my Twitter account.
[01:48:38.860 --> 01:48:39.860]   And I thought it went pretty well.
[01:48:39.860 --> 01:48:42.220]   We were just talking about audio technology.
[01:48:42.220 --> 01:48:47.420]   So we had Brian Maddox, who's one of our top audio engineers as well as John Tautoules
[01:48:47.420 --> 01:48:52.420]   from Sound Devices just talking geekery and answering questions.
[01:48:52.420 --> 01:48:53.940]   So it's on hazu.
[01:48:53.940 --> 01:48:58.540]   It's probably the easiest way to find that is through Twitter.
[01:48:58.540 --> 01:49:00.900]   So you know, as far as the full URL.
[01:49:00.900 --> 01:49:05.540]   But but anyway, but you might want to check it out and see if you like it.
[01:49:05.540 --> 01:49:07.500]   But we're going to do I think we're going to do more of those this year.
[01:49:07.500 --> 01:49:08.500]   It's kind of an experiment.
[01:49:08.500 --> 01:49:09.500]   Nice.
[01:49:09.500 --> 01:49:10.500]   Really cool.
[01:49:10.500 --> 01:49:12.500]   Is it so it's video?
[01:49:12.500 --> 01:49:13.500]   It's video.
[01:49:13.500 --> 01:49:14.500]   Yeah.
[01:49:14.500 --> 01:49:16.420]   So it's it's we're trying to figure out what to do with it.
[01:49:16.420 --> 01:49:21.660]   It's one of those things that you know, the idea is to get it's really going to be production
[01:49:21.660 --> 01:49:23.660]   oriented.
[01:49:23.660 --> 01:49:26.540]   And and so it's it's really geeky.
[01:49:26.540 --> 01:49:28.020]   You know, geeky.
[01:49:28.020 --> 01:49:29.540]   In this case, we're talking about audio.
[01:49:29.540 --> 01:49:33.860]   The next one might be 360 or live switching or you know, things that we think that we're
[01:49:33.860 --> 01:49:38.260]   interested in things that we think that we're interested in talking around media tech.
[01:49:38.260 --> 01:49:39.660]   And but it just kind of an open discussion.
[01:49:39.660 --> 01:49:42.900]   And because it's sitting on Hazeu, it you know, people can ask questions and vote them
[01:49:42.900 --> 01:49:47.540]   up and down and we can we just kind of let the questions drive the it's not it's it's
[01:49:47.540 --> 01:49:49.220]   really not that structured.
[01:49:49.220 --> 01:49:50.740]   We talked about a couple of things we want to talk about.
[01:49:50.740 --> 01:49:54.380]   And then for the most part, 90% of it is just the answer to people's questions.
[01:49:54.380 --> 01:49:56.180]   Really cool.
[01:49:56.180 --> 01:49:58.380]   And Hazeu is your is your thing, right?
[01:49:58.380 --> 01:49:59.380]   Yes.
[01:49:59.380 --> 01:50:00.380]   Yeah.
[01:50:00.380 --> 01:50:01.380]   So it's a little nice.
[01:50:01.380 --> 01:50:02.380]   I like that.
[01:50:02.380 --> 01:50:03.380]   It's gotten a little kind of a little find.
[01:50:03.380 --> 01:50:04.380]   Yes.
[01:50:04.380 --> 01:50:05.380]   It's very slick.
[01:50:05.380 --> 01:50:09.580]   Well, the little chat function, YouTube in bed up top.
[01:50:09.580 --> 01:50:10.580]   Yeah.
[01:50:10.580 --> 01:50:14.740]   So it's it's gotten it's growing like this getting better.
[01:50:14.740 --> 01:50:15.740]   Thanks, Alex.
[01:50:15.740 --> 01:50:16.740]   Thanks to all of you for joining us.
[01:50:16.740 --> 01:50:21.300]   We do Mac break weekly on Tuesdays, 11 am Pacific 2 p.m. Eastern 2100 UTC.
[01:50:21.300 --> 01:50:24.940]   If you want to stop, I say hi, you could also join us in the studio.
[01:50:24.940 --> 01:50:26.340]   Just email tickets at twit.tv.
[01:50:26.340 --> 01:50:31.660]   Wait till the rain stops because otherwise, you know, no, two of the three ways to get
[01:50:31.660 --> 01:50:32.860]   here were closed.
[01:50:32.860 --> 01:50:36.300]   And the last way is the boat.
[01:50:36.300 --> 01:50:40.220]   The last way I still had to go buy a clothes sign and Ford it in my Tesla.
[01:50:40.220 --> 01:50:41.220]   I put the high.
[01:50:41.220 --> 01:50:42.220]   The high.
[01:50:42.220 --> 01:50:43.220]   Yeah.
[01:50:43.220 --> 01:50:44.220]   Yeah.
[01:50:44.220 --> 01:50:45.220]   It was like a lotus.
[01:50:45.220 --> 01:50:47.220]   It went to submarine mode and you made it through.
[01:50:47.220 --> 01:50:48.220]   Yeah.
[01:50:48.220 --> 01:50:49.220]   That was Sunday.
[01:50:49.220 --> 01:50:50.220]   It's it's raining today, too.
[01:50:50.220 --> 01:50:51.220]   And I think we're going to have more flooding.
[01:50:51.220 --> 01:50:56.220]   So if you can't be here in person or watch live on the stream, don't worry on demand audio
[01:50:56.220 --> 01:50:59.340]   and video of everything we do is available after the fact of twit.tv.
[01:50:59.340 --> 01:51:04.860]   In this case, twit.tv/mbw for Mac break weekly, or you could subscribe.
[01:51:04.860 --> 01:51:12.660]   We have lots of ways to watch on Apple TV on iOS on Android everywhere.
[01:51:12.660 --> 01:51:13.660]   Roku.
[01:51:13.660 --> 01:51:19.620]   Actually, now that we're on YouTube live at youtube.com/twit, you can watch the live stream
[01:51:19.620 --> 01:51:23.420]   and watch the individual episodes for any show there.
[01:51:23.420 --> 01:51:27.500]   That makes it available on a lot of platforms because almost everything has a YouTube app.
[01:51:27.500 --> 01:51:29.260]   So another way to watch live.
[01:51:29.260 --> 01:51:31.260]   When are you going to 4k, Leo?
[01:51:31.260 --> 01:51:38.940]   Now, we did our first public 4k stream with Natalie Don from Pompliness.
[01:51:38.940 --> 01:51:40.260]   Oh, I love her.
[01:51:40.260 --> 01:51:41.260]   If you go to Natalie Don.
[01:51:41.260 --> 01:51:44.260]   She's one of the few people who would actually look good in 4k.
[01:51:44.260 --> 01:51:45.260]   She does.
[01:51:45.260 --> 01:51:46.260]   Yeah.
[01:51:46.260 --> 01:51:47.260]   Where is it?
[01:51:47.260 --> 01:51:51.140]   We see you are it's on Natalie Don's channel in YouTube.
[01:51:51.140 --> 01:51:58.020]   And it's a it's our first we've done lots of testing in 4k, but this is our first public
[01:51:58.020 --> 01:51:59.500]   4k stream.
[01:51:59.500 --> 01:52:04.500]   So it was I remember, you know, the nice thing is, um, oh, look at that.
[01:52:04.500 --> 01:52:05.500]   This is great.
[01:52:05.500 --> 01:52:12.340]   The nice thing is, um, thanks to a YouTube, people can watch 4k back when it was 1080p
[01:52:12.340 --> 01:52:18.100]   and you didn't have YouTube, it was we challenged people considerably when we started doing
[01:52:18.100 --> 01:52:19.100]   this kind of stuff.
[01:52:19.100 --> 01:52:23.580]   But now you can do it and people will see it at whatever scale of resolution they're
[01:52:23.580 --> 01:52:24.580]   capable of.
[01:52:24.580 --> 01:52:25.580]   Does look good.
[01:52:25.580 --> 01:52:27.180]   What did you shoot this with?
[01:52:27.180 --> 01:52:35.780]   We shot those with those are black magic, uh, uh, black magic, um, mini Ursas, uh, 4.6s
[01:52:35.780 --> 01:52:42.020]   and then we had a PL lenses on the Canon, um, Canon 17 to 120s.
[01:52:42.020 --> 01:52:44.060]   Those are, you know, big, big lenses.
[01:52:44.060 --> 01:52:45.060]   This is nice.
[01:52:45.060 --> 01:52:46.060]   It's really nice.
[01:52:46.060 --> 01:52:51.060]   It's kind of like a little Q and A, um, and they played, I think, five or six songs and
[01:52:51.060 --> 01:52:53.580]   the, I mean, everything came out.
[01:52:53.580 --> 01:52:54.820]   We thought really well.
[01:52:54.820 --> 01:53:00.380]   So, um, so it's definitely, uh, but if you want to see some, some live, live stream 4k,
[01:53:00.380 --> 01:53:01.380]   it's.
[01:53:01.380 --> 01:53:02.380]   That's amazing.
[01:53:02.380 --> 01:53:05.540]   This is, uh, this is HBO quality.
[01:53:05.540 --> 01:53:06.540]   Really looks good.
[01:53:06.540 --> 01:53:10.540]   Yeah, we played pretty hard on it and we were really excited that they let us, uh, that
[01:53:10.540 --> 01:53:13.820]   we took over the lunchroom at, uh, Patreon.
[01:53:13.820 --> 01:53:14.820]   Oh, nice.
[01:53:14.820 --> 01:53:17.740]   So where her husband, Jack Conte, is the founder.
[01:53:17.740 --> 01:53:19.260]   So she has an in there.
[01:53:19.260 --> 01:53:20.260]   Yeah.
[01:53:20.260 --> 01:53:21.660]   That's what gave us a space to work on.
[01:53:21.660 --> 01:53:22.660]   Nice.
[01:53:22.660 --> 01:53:26.300]   And, uh, YouTube's, uh, Natalie Donchannell, N-A-T-A-L-Y.

[01:53:32.860 --> 01:53:33.860]   Make time is over.
