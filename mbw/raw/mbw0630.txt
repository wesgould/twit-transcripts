[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.360]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly. Renee Richie is here. Andy Enoco.
[00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:07.040]   And of course Alex Lindsey. We'll talk about the iPhone.
[00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:09.540]   10S has been out for a while now and people are starting to
[00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:13.980]   nitpick problems with charging, problems with wireless
[00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:17.260]   and even problems with the camera. We'll even do a deep dive
[00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:21.560]   on what the iPhone camera is doing and how to get it to work better for you. It's all
[00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:22.440]   coming up next.

[00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.240]   Mac Break Weekly Assemble.
[00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:56.240]   From Montreal, I should give each of you like an Avenger name.
[00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:59.240]   Oh, I'm assembled Leo. I'm assembled all over the show.
[00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:02.240]   ReneeRitchie.imore.com
[00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:05.240]   Can I do the night thing like Tony Stark and just hit my chest and have the armor
[00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:08.240]   just leap out. I love that. I love that so much.
[00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:10.240]   Wouldn't that be awesome? I need it for the winter. It would be great.
[00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:13.240]   Where do you see my Halloween custom?
[00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:19.240]   Actually, I think I have a little bit of it on my blog if you want to see it.
[00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:21.240]   Was it you in there? I saw something interesting.
[00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:23.240]   I might have seen Lisa post something interesting.
[00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:25.240]   That was me in there.
[00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:28.240]   That's me in that real fine suit.
[00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:30.240]   He got you.
[00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:34.240]   I really want people to throw cantaloupes at you, don't you?
[00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:37.240]   You think he's cute and then he hits you with lightning bolt in his pocket.
[00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:40.240]   But that's the best darn 40 bucks I ever spent.
[00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:42.240]   I got to say, that was only 40 bucks.
[00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:46.240]   Is it like a sumo suit inside? Can you like rassel in that thing?
[00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:48.240]   It's got a fan. It's inflated.
[00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:49.240]   Wow.
[00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:53.240]   And actually I read in the reviews, somebody said, can I wear this to work?
[00:02:53.240 --> 00:03:02.240]   And they said, well, you can see on your left on your last day, either because you know it's your last day or you know it's going to be your last day.
[00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:08.240]   That's Andy and not co she formally Chicago sometimes now WGBH Boston public radio.
[00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:13.240]   You're a tote bags. Yes. Get a free tote bag when you donate.
[00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:19.240]   And from the Pixel core Alex Lindsey in the house at Alex Lindsey back from DC.
[00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:20.240]   Yep.
[00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:26.240]   Nice to see you for the moment for the nonce.
[00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:34.240]   So here we are in week two of the iPhone 10s and as is often the case, there are a few little.
[00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:39.240]   Hitches minor hitches. Gotcha's gotcha's.
[00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:44.240]   The big one right now is the charging issue, right? Somebody called it in the Charum charge gate.
[00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:47.240]   I don't think it's risen to the gate.
[00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:51.240]   No, you got to gate everything Leo. If you mispronounce a word, it's you know, it's a gate.
[00:03:51.240 --> 00:04:01.240]   I asked Jason Snell about this on iOS today earlier and he said, yeah Apple just figures you don't need to fast charge.
[00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:05.240]   It's an overnight thing. I don't know. Is that the case? What? What do we know about this?
[00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:12.240]   So it was what happened was some people noticed that when they plugged in their new iPhone 10s, it wouldn't charge if it was already in sleep mode.
[00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:16.240]   If they woke it up, it began to charge fine. If it was already awake, it began to charge fine.
[00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:24.240]   If they wirelessly were charging it, it was fine. But if it was off and they plugged it in, it just looked like it wouldn't start charging until they woke it up.
[00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:30.240]   And then people started to say, hey, this is happening to me on my newly updated iOS 12 iPhone or iPad.
[00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:34.240]   And you know, videos were made, bodies were left strewn over Twitter.
[00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:41.240]   And then today Apple pushed out the new update for, well, the new beta for iOS 12.1, which addresses it.
[00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:47.240]   And they said they found in their testing that some phones just wouldn't engage the charging system sometimes for long periods of time.
[00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:50.240]   The wake up would sort of wake them up and literally get them to engage immediately.
[00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:55.240]   And what the fix does is just make sure that the second you put that cable in, that charge system is engaged.
[00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:59.240]   And then the other issue is that it doesn't seem to charge very quickly.
[00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:03.240]   Certainly not with the little dongle that comes in the box.
[00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:04.240]   The five water?
[00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:05.240]   The five water.
[00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:11.240]   But if you get the USB-C 29 watt charger, even then, it's not a super fast charge.
[00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:15.240]   It'll charge it. So, I mean, Apple is still super conservative in some areas.
[00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:18.240]   And one of them is battery and power management.
[00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:24.240]   And you don't need to point to other vendors because every vendor has had issues with charging and with batteries over time.
[00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:31.240]   So what they do is that you'll find whole pages of scientists telling you why it is incredibly important to never charge wirelessly and never charge quickly,
[00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:35.240]   because heat is the enemy of lithium ion.
[00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:41.240]   And you are just wasting away precious seconds, maybe minutes of the lifespan of your battery over a three year period,
[00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:47.240]   where I would argue, and I think many other people would argue that for most people, the amount of convenience you get out of fast charging,
[00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:51.240]   even if it costs you like a week of battery life over three years, it's fine.
[00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:53.240]   It's much more important to charge quickly.
[00:05:53.240 --> 00:06:01.240]   So what Apple does is they will allow it to charge fairly quickly up to 50% and then shunted back down to normal charging,
[00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:05.240]   because they are sort of wary about the thermal damage that it can do if it's hot.
[00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:09.240]   And they also recommend that if you really want to charge fast, take it out of a case or anything like that,
[00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:15.240]   because the more heat that generates, the more damage it causes, and they monitor more for the heat than they do for the charge level.
[00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:21.240]   So these people are testing the 29 watt versus the whatever it is, 5 watt or 10 watt.
[00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:28.240]   They're looking at over 100%, but really if you looked at it to the first 50%, it would charge faster.
[00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:29.240]   Yeah.
[00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:30.240]   Yeah.
[00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:31.240]   All right.
[00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:32.240]   That's probably what you want.
[00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:33.240]   You want to plug it in.
[00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:41.240]   When you're down to 5%, you got to charge while you shave enough to get to the office, and that's perfectly fine.
[00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:44.240]   Most makers do something like that.
[00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:51.240]   I would love to see an engineer write a full book about all the problems we are not aware of to make a phone,
[00:06:51.240 --> 00:07:00.240]   a modern phone actually work among them being, here's how we charge a battery so that it doesn't destroy all the electronics in the case or kill a battery within.
[00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:01.240]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:06.240]   It's like, and I did have that issue with my mind.
[00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:07.240]   Does this thing work?
[00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:09.240]   You have the 10S Max.
[00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:09.240]   Max.
[00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:09.240]   Max.
[00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:10.240]   Max.
[00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:13.240]   And I plugged it in and I came back later and I was like, "Hey, I didn't do anything."
[00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:16.240]   And so it was one of those things that I was like, "Well, I don't know what I did wrong."
[00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:22.240]   And of course I turned it on, plugged in, started charging, so I didn't think about it until they started talking about it.
[00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:24.240]   But you had the sleep problem.
[00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:25.240]   Yeah, the sleep problem.
[00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:34.240]   And I figured it'll fix it.
[00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:35.240]   I was like, "Oh, I'm sure they'll fix this in a .1 or they'll..."
[00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:36.240]   I was like, "Yeah, they did."
[00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:40.240]   Yeah, it's just kind of like, but it's a...
[00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:47.240]   I think that overall though, I guess I don't ever have it go down very much because I have...
[00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:51.240]   I think there's a culture within our company at least of having chargers everywhere.
[00:07:51.240 --> 00:07:59.240]   So my phone has a charger, I've got a battery in my backpack, I've got things everywhere, and I needed it all until I finally took Facebook off my phone.
[00:07:59.240 --> 00:08:01.240]   I didn't leave Facebook, I'm just...
[00:08:01.240 --> 00:08:01.240]   I took it off.
[00:08:01.240 --> 00:08:05.240]   But I just took it off my phone and it's like, suddenly my battery lasts forever.
[00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:08.240]   I was like, "This is... I used to be, I had to charge a couple times a day."
[00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:14.240]   And now I'm like, "Oh, you look at Facebook Messenger and the battery thing and it'll say like five minutes on screen three hours."
[00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:15.240]   Oh, crap.
[00:08:15.240 --> 00:08:20.240]   Yeah, there's a reason why both platforms now do a form of battery shaming because...
[00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:27.240]   People at Apple and people at Google have both talked to me about how hard it is to convince developers collectively
[00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:33.240]   that we've given you some wonderful, simple rules to follow that will not kill the consumer's battery.
[00:08:33.240 --> 00:08:39.240]   And that's been of like a huge, huge program they've been trying to enforce for the last two or three years.
[00:08:39.240 --> 00:08:43.240]   And the only thing that's working is making sure that the world knows, "Okay, guess what Facebook?
[00:08:43.240 --> 00:08:49.240]   We're telling everybody who complains about our battery problem is going to say, "Well, delete Facebook."
[00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:53.240]   That's like having a two pound lead acid motorcycle battery.
[00:08:53.240 --> 00:08:55.240]   I didn't do it for the battery.
[00:08:55.240 --> 00:08:56.240]   It's not a chance to, yeah.
[00:08:56.240 --> 00:09:00.240]   I literally reached maximum Facebook last week with all the troubles that were happening in DC.
[00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:01.240]   I'm in the middle of it.
[00:09:01.240 --> 00:09:05.240]   So everyone there, everyone in the floor that I'm in, that's all they're talking about because they're all press,
[00:09:05.240 --> 00:09:07.240]   you know, for the international press is all there.
[00:09:07.240 --> 00:09:09.240]   So that's all anyone's talking about.
[00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:13.240]   And then I go to Facebook and it's all anybody's talking about is like, "Okay, I need to stop somewhere. I can't move."
[00:09:13.240 --> 00:09:14.240]   Oh, there's...
[00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:15.240]   There's one more thing we should point out.
[00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:19.240]   Some people still obsess over like charging it to 80% and letting it discharge to 40%
[00:09:19.240 --> 00:09:22.240]   and then never letting it get too high, never letting it get too low.
[00:09:22.240 --> 00:09:24.240]   Modern power management is really, really good.
[00:09:24.240 --> 00:09:26.240]   You don't have to do any of that anymore.
[00:09:26.240 --> 00:09:30.240]   You might, again, eke out a week, an extra battery life over three years if you do micromanage it.
[00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:34.240]   But if you think about all the time, it takes you with the effort and stress to micromanage it.
[00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:36.240]   You deserve that week of your life back.
[00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:42.240]   The other issue that's coming up a little bit, and I've seen a few stories about it,
[00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:47.240]   about problems with data, particularly Wi-Fi and cellular data.
[00:09:47.240 --> 00:09:50.240]   And at least is having this with her iPhone, 10S Max.
[00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:54.240]   Sometimes she'll have to reboot it a few times before she can really get online.
[00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:59.240]   Mine's not having any problems, but I'm seeing people complaining about that.
[00:09:59.240 --> 00:10:01.240]   What do we know about that issue?
[00:10:01.240 --> 00:10:03.240]   They have gone 100% into Intel Modems.
[00:10:03.240 --> 00:10:07.240]   So previously, I mean, Infineon was the original iPhone modem supplier,
[00:10:07.240 --> 00:10:11.240]   and then Apple switched to Qualcomm when they went to CDMA because long story short,
[00:10:11.240 --> 00:10:14.240]   Qualcomm just owns CDMA and a lot of LTE.
[00:10:14.240 --> 00:10:19.240]   But Apple and Qualcomm, well, Qualcomm and a lot of people have been having battles over really
[00:10:19.240 --> 00:10:24.240]   like the fairness of those patents and what is reasonable in terms of licensee V.
[00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:26.240]   So Apple's been trying to move away from Qualcomm.
[00:10:26.240 --> 00:10:30.240]   They went halfway and switched all the GSM modems to Intel a couple of years ago,
[00:10:30.240 --> 00:10:33.240]   and this year they just switched all the modems to Intel.
[00:10:33.240 --> 00:10:37.240]   So if you've been using it on AT&T or on T-Mobile, most times in most places,
[00:10:37.240 --> 00:10:41.240]   you'll be getting better reception than ever because they're up to gigabit LTE
[00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:44.240]   and they're doing 4x4 multi-in-multi out.
[00:10:44.240 --> 00:10:48.240]   But if you were used to Verizon and Sprint, you switched over to Intel.
[00:10:48.240 --> 00:10:51.240]   It has profoundly different characteristics.
[00:10:51.240 --> 00:10:53.240]   And for some people, some people say it's better.
[00:10:53.240 --> 00:10:55.240]   Some people say they are having problems connecting.
[00:10:55.240 --> 00:11:00.240]   Their data is going down, especially in fringe areas where you have a very low signal.
[00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:03.240]   There's no attenuation or detuning like an iPhone four days.
[00:11:03.240 --> 00:11:06.240]   Like you can't just put your finger on that new antenna thing and pause
[00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:08.240]   and resume your network connection.
[00:11:08.240 --> 00:11:13.240]   But people are dropping down to 3G or they're having other problems.
[00:11:13.240 --> 00:11:19.240]   And my guess is similarly, we'll see a carrier update or one of the 12.0 or 12.1 updates.
[00:11:19.240 --> 00:11:20.240]   We'll fine tune it now.
[00:11:20.240 --> 00:11:23.240]   They're collecting a ton of data from a ton of people.
[00:11:23.240 --> 00:11:27.240]   I've noticed mine is having more breakup with my AirPods.
[00:11:27.240 --> 00:11:33.240]   It's an odd, you hear this like stereo fall, and literally the phone's in my pocket.
[00:11:33.240 --> 00:11:37.240]   And I'm just hearing this every once in a while, you hear this degradation in the AirPod
[00:11:37.240 --> 00:11:40.240]   that I didn't have a week ago with my other request.
[00:11:40.240 --> 00:11:42.240]   It's wish to Bluetooth 5, I think.
[00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:45.240]   But then only I shouldn't cause a problem.
[00:11:45.240 --> 00:11:47.240]   Are we getting new AirPods, by the way?
[00:11:47.240 --> 00:11:48.240]   I thought we were good.
[00:11:48.240 --> 00:11:50.240]   Where are we supposed to have new AirPods?
[00:11:50.240 --> 00:11:52.240]   I think we were supposed to have that event.
[00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:55.240]   And I think circumstances conspired so that we're not having a fraud.
[00:11:55.240 --> 00:11:56.240]   Okay.
[00:11:56.240 --> 00:11:57.240]   Okay.
[00:11:57.240 --> 00:12:02.240]   I'm wondering if they're going to break apart the G-charging phone case
[00:12:02.240 --> 00:12:05.240]   from now the AirPods.
[00:12:05.240 --> 00:12:12.240]   Because I haven't heard anything about how the actual, again, wireless charging AirPod case
[00:12:12.240 --> 00:12:14.240]   is hung up.
[00:12:14.240 --> 00:12:16.240]   And it seems like something that they want to get on.
[00:12:16.240 --> 00:12:21.240]   And it seems like the sort of thing where if they release it any time before December 20th
[00:12:21.240 --> 00:12:25.240]   and have them in stores, they're going to have a very, very happy time with it.
[00:12:25.240 --> 00:12:30.240]   It'll be not just money for them, but it'll also be a good thing to remind people
[00:12:30.240 --> 00:12:32.240]   that these things exist and we're actually upgrading them.
[00:12:32.240 --> 00:12:35.240]   And at this point, it'd be a little bit, not not wary.
[00:12:35.240 --> 00:12:40.240]   But if I could hold off on buying AirPods until, let's say, January,
[00:12:40.240 --> 00:12:44.240]   I would want to do that because I would want to see what they do,
[00:12:44.240 --> 00:12:47.240]   not just with wireless charging, but to see if they've got a new battery design
[00:12:47.240 --> 00:12:50.240]   or something else that's going to make it worth my while to wait.
[00:12:50.240 --> 00:12:53.240]   I think spring was the last I heard.
[00:12:53.240 --> 00:12:57.240]   And it's part of getting them with the new AirPods that have the sweat/water resistance
[00:12:57.240 --> 00:13:00.240]   and the onboard Siri parsing and stuff like that.
[00:13:00.240 --> 00:13:02.240]   Not this month during an iPad and that's fine.
[00:13:02.240 --> 00:13:05.240]   I mean, never say never, and they could always show them off or something.
[00:13:05.240 --> 00:13:08.240]   But the last, I think, the rumors were spring-ish.
[00:13:08.240 --> 00:13:09.240]   Spring.
[00:13:09.240 --> 00:13:13.240]   Are they going to kill the wireless charger?
[00:13:13.240 --> 00:13:19.240]   Everyone thought they were, and then good old Guy Rambo found strings for it in iOS 12.1.
[00:13:19.240 --> 00:13:20.240]   Wow.
[00:13:20.240 --> 00:13:23.240]   I'll expect it when I see it. It's Gandalf to me now.
[00:13:23.240 --> 00:13:28.240]   Yeah, I think about 60/40 in favor only.
[00:13:28.240 --> 00:13:30.240]   I don't think they will cancel it out, right?
[00:13:30.240 --> 00:13:34.240]   But I think there's a possibility that the amount of time they've put into it
[00:13:34.240 --> 00:13:37.240]   has led them to basically take version two.
[00:13:37.240 --> 00:13:40.240]   What was going to be version two of this product and make it version one?
[00:13:40.240 --> 00:13:44.240]   So it might be that they might have to sort of announce something that kind of supersedes
[00:13:44.240 --> 00:13:48.240]   it either just internal, if not externally, at least internally.
[00:13:48.240 --> 00:13:50.240]   It's a very weird situation.
[00:13:50.240 --> 00:13:55.240]   When I have conversations with people who let me at least talk about this stuff on background,
[00:13:55.240 --> 00:14:01.240]   it is the weirdest product cycle I have ever heard of in terms of optimus,
[00:14:01.240 --> 00:14:06.240]   being dead certain about something as they're developing it,
[00:14:06.240 --> 00:14:10.240]   and then being dead certain of nothing at certain points during the process.
[00:14:10.240 --> 00:14:13.240]   One of the interesting things that we could also talk about the Wi-Fi and the Bluetooth
[00:14:13.240 --> 00:14:17.240]   and the cellular is that there are so many iPhones now and so many people using it
[00:14:17.240 --> 00:14:20.240]   with so many accessories that it seems like every time there's an update,
[00:14:20.240 --> 00:14:23.240]   like 1% of people get much better in performance,
[00:14:23.240 --> 00:14:27.240]   99% are fine and over there, 98% are fine, and 1% get worse performance.
[00:14:27.240 --> 00:14:30.240]   And it's like a butterfly effect of reasons why.
[00:14:30.240 --> 00:14:34.240]   And you could go from being super upset to being super happy or being super fine
[00:14:34.240 --> 00:14:35.240]   to being super upset.
[00:14:35.240 --> 00:14:39.240]   And I don't know if that's just a question of scale and diversity in the ecosystem,
[00:14:39.240 --> 00:14:42.240]   but I think it's something that as soon as you tap one of them out,
[00:14:42.240 --> 00:14:44.240]   it seems like one other little thing comes up.
[00:14:44.240 --> 00:14:47.240]   And all I can say is the people who are super upset, it's very unlikely
[00:14:47.240 --> 00:14:49.240]   they've ever actually developed a product of their own.
[00:14:49.240 --> 00:14:51.240]   No, okay.
[00:14:51.240 --> 00:14:58.240]   No, that's actually true, but I'm just saying these are the problems that you have to deal with
[00:14:58.240 --> 00:15:00.240]   when you're selling a $1,000 phone.
[00:15:00.240 --> 00:15:03.240]   No, no, no, no, let me finish my thought.
[00:15:03.240 --> 00:15:07.240]   I'm just saying that I bought 90 dollar phones.
[00:15:07.240 --> 00:15:10.240]   I have a 90 dollar phone that's in regular rotation that I absolutely love,
[00:15:10.240 --> 00:15:13.240]   and I'm willing to forgive a whole bunch of stuff about it because it's a 90 dollar phone.
[00:15:13.240 --> 00:15:18.240]   A thousand bucks, you don't want to find out, gee, why is my Wi-Fi like cutting out?
[00:15:18.240 --> 00:15:24.240]   And instead of working fine instead of my $300 phone from three years ago,
[00:15:24.240 --> 00:15:30.240]   and then go online and see some of the less responsible people writing
[00:15:30.240 --> 00:15:37.240]   and 10 to gate for volume four, Apple refuses to confirm problems,
[00:15:37.240 --> 00:15:40.240]   Wi-Fi problems and new release of iPhone Xs.
[00:15:40.240 --> 00:15:48.240]   So, yeah, I always tell people who have complaints, often legitimate complaints
[00:15:48.240 --> 00:15:53.240]   in the first couple of weeks, realize that this is not just a toaster
[00:15:53.240 --> 00:15:56.240]   where you plug it in and it works in the pre-IOT era.
[00:15:56.240 --> 00:16:02.240]   It's an interaction between the software, the firmware, the baseband, the hardware,
[00:16:02.240 --> 00:16:07.240]   and then the whole network it's working on plus the base station that's connecting to.
[00:16:07.240 --> 00:16:11.240]   It really does, I do think that almost every major release of hardware,
[00:16:11.240 --> 00:16:16.240]   iPhones can get much, much better after a month only because there's a whole bunch of fine-tuning
[00:16:16.240 --> 00:16:20.240]   happening behind the scenes at Apple and outside of Apple that we can't see.
[00:16:20.240 --> 00:16:22.240]   And I think that it's, I mean, definitely people should discuss it,
[00:16:22.240 --> 00:16:25.240]   but when people are like throwing, I see you see online people are just like,
[00:16:25.240 --> 00:16:27.240]   "This is unacceptable, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah."
[00:16:27.240 --> 00:16:30.240]   And I'm like, "You definitely don't work in product development."
[00:16:30.240 --> 00:16:34.240]   You just understand that there's a fog of war of you're putting this stuff together,
[00:16:34.240 --> 00:16:35.240]   you're doing the best you can,
[00:16:35.240 --> 00:16:38.240]   and when you have, you have a sample that's this small and it's super quiet
[00:16:38.240 --> 00:16:43.240]   and it can only be very, you know, a certain size because you don't want everyone to know about it.
[00:16:43.240 --> 00:16:46.240]   So it's a tiny sample and then you greatly increase that sample
[00:16:46.240 --> 00:16:49.240]   and a whole bunch of other stuff comes out, you know, and that's what, as you said,
[00:16:49.240 --> 00:16:51.240]   that's what the first month or two, then they kind of tamp all that down
[00:16:51.240 --> 00:16:53.240]   and then we all forget about it until then.
[00:16:53.240 --> 00:16:55.240]   I feel like you have to judge them based on how they react.
[00:16:55.240 --> 00:16:58.240]   Like every company has launched day issues and it's how those companies react to them,
[00:16:58.240 --> 00:17:01.240]   the speed, and candor and all those things that you have to judge them by.
[00:17:01.240 --> 00:17:02.240]   Absolutely.
[00:17:02.240 --> 00:17:07.240]   That's why it's such a good thing when Apple, over the past couple of years particularly,
[00:17:07.240 --> 00:17:10.240]   they've been better at making a public acknowledgement,
[00:17:10.240 --> 00:17:14.240]   at least not, again, not tear their shirt open or put something on the website,
[00:17:14.240 --> 00:17:18.240]   but simply when someone complains about something
[00:17:18.240 --> 00:17:22.240]   and gets a response back that wasn't an automatic bounce back saying,
[00:17:22.240 --> 00:17:24.240]   "We're looking at this problem and we're taking it seriously,"
[00:17:24.240 --> 00:17:27.240]   that will give people about two to three weeks worth of,
[00:17:27.240 --> 00:17:29.240]   "Okay, we'll wait and see what happens,"
[00:17:29.240 --> 00:17:32.240]   and then Apple usually has a patch for something,
[00:17:32.240 --> 00:17:37.240]   or at least they rethink how they tuned the camera, how they tuned in antenna earlier.
[00:17:37.240 --> 00:17:40.240]   It's in the old days when you're like,
[00:17:40.240 --> 00:17:44.240]   "Okay, this is going to be one of those things where you deny
[00:17:44.240 --> 00:17:50.240]   that I've been seeing the actual antenna signal strength go from five to one,
[00:17:50.240 --> 00:17:53.240]   and then after about a month when you have to deal with it,
[00:17:53.240 --> 00:17:56.240]   you tell me it's my fault for holding it wrong, is it?"
[00:17:56.240 --> 00:18:01.240]   Yeah. No, I actually have the cellular signal thing turned on, and I can watch it.
[00:18:01.240 --> 00:18:04.240]   Yeah.
[00:18:04.240 --> 00:18:08.240]   What about the 10R? When can we order that?
[00:18:08.240 --> 00:18:12.240]   I was 21st, I think, then it comes out in '26, right?
[00:18:12.240 --> 00:18:16.240]   Yeah. So we're not that far off. I mean, we're a few weeks off from that.
[00:18:16.240 --> 00:18:21.240]   Do we know anything about that at all? Have they sent out?
[00:18:21.240 --> 00:18:24.240]   Okay, you probably can't answer this.
[00:18:24.240 --> 00:18:28.240]   Just nod if you... How could we phrase this?
[00:18:28.240 --> 00:18:32.240]   If they had a 10R sent out to people,
[00:18:32.240 --> 00:18:35.240]   you think somebody might have one?
[00:18:35.240 --> 00:18:39.240]   It would typically be too early for that kind of stuff, and also historically Apple.
[00:18:39.240 --> 00:18:43.240]   Also, historically Apple, when it's not at the event,
[00:18:43.240 --> 00:18:47.240]   they've done briefings like anywhere from a week to the night before.
[00:18:47.240 --> 00:18:48.240]   Oh, wow.
[00:18:48.240 --> 00:18:50.240]   So it's really hard to tell.
[00:18:50.240 --> 00:18:54.240]   Okay. It seems like the sort of thing will have...
[00:18:54.240 --> 00:18:59.240]   They'll have a hotel in New York and a hotel in Chicago,
[00:18:59.240 --> 00:19:01.240]   and they'll have their days of briefing.
[00:19:01.240 --> 00:19:04.240]   They can do that anytime. They need to have a separate thing.
[00:19:04.240 --> 00:19:06.240]   And also, there's strategies so different out there.
[00:19:06.240 --> 00:19:09.240]   There could be a bunch of YouTube videos already being made. Who knows?
[00:19:09.240 --> 00:19:10.240]   Yeah, right.
[00:19:10.240 --> 00:19:11.240]   Yeah, we don't know. Absolutely, right? Yeah.
[00:19:11.240 --> 00:19:13.240]   I should ask Marcus Brownley is what you're saying.
[00:19:13.240 --> 00:19:16.240]   Well, what's amazing is that the bloggers are feeling about the YouTubers now,
[00:19:16.240 --> 00:19:18.240]   the way the magazine people felt about the bloggers 10 years ago.
[00:19:18.240 --> 00:19:20.240]   It's all like nobody ever learned from those things.
[00:19:20.240 --> 00:19:21.240]   Yeah.
[00:19:21.240 --> 00:19:26.240]   It's something that bears repeating that when you see that journalists,
[00:19:26.240 --> 00:19:30.240]   and I will use the broadest term possible because everybody who has a good point of view
[00:19:30.240 --> 00:19:34.240]   and is honest is somewhere on the journalism spectrum.
[00:19:34.240 --> 00:19:36.240]   It's not...
[00:19:36.240 --> 00:19:40.240]   Whereas maybe 10 or 15 years ago, there used to be this mystique about,
[00:19:40.240 --> 00:19:43.240]   "Ooh, this person got loaded, or... Ooh, this person got... Ooh, this person..."
[00:19:43.240 --> 00:19:47.240]   Realize it every single time they have a certain number of these pieces of hardware.
[00:19:47.240 --> 00:19:49.240]   A lot of these pieces of hardware are allotted.
[00:19:49.240 --> 00:19:52.240]   And they decide... Every time they're going to decide,
[00:19:52.240 --> 00:19:58.240]   "What do we want to achieve with the two days before release day coverage?"
[00:19:58.240 --> 00:20:00.240]   And they want to try to manage that a little bit.
[00:20:00.240 --> 00:20:06.240]   So that's why it's important to notice, like, if someone with a disability blog,
[00:20:06.240 --> 00:20:10.240]   for instance, gets one early, that's an important thing to take note of
[00:20:10.240 --> 00:20:15.240]   because that means that they don't think that they want that person's audience specifically to hear about this.
[00:20:15.240 --> 00:20:19.240]   They know that this person is going to write about a focus on areas of the performance
[00:20:19.240 --> 00:20:22.240]   that someone like me is not going to focus on.
[00:20:22.240 --> 00:20:28.240]   So that's why there was a year ago or a couple years ago that someone...
[00:20:28.240 --> 00:20:34.240]   That someone did a chart of, like, the timeline of people getting early hardware
[00:20:34.240 --> 00:20:39.240]   and, like, a two-way chart of hardware releases and, like, pundits
[00:20:39.240 --> 00:20:43.240]   and who got ones early and who didn't, trying to prop some sort of a vector
[00:20:43.240 --> 00:20:47.240]   about something about, I don't know, whether it was about access journalism
[00:20:47.240 --> 00:20:51.240]   or about being on some sort of special list or whatever.
[00:20:51.240 --> 00:20:55.240]   And you look at that and say, "No, that's because the big deal about this release
[00:20:55.240 --> 00:20:57.240]   was super, super, super new camera."
[00:20:57.240 --> 00:21:01.240]   So they don't really want the person who is super, super good at networking.
[00:21:01.240 --> 00:21:05.240]   If they got 10 pieces of hardware to... Not just 10 pieces of hardware,
[00:21:05.240 --> 00:21:11.240]   but 10 hour-long briefings and 10 people who are going to be on 24-hour standby for questions,
[00:21:11.240 --> 00:21:14.240]   let's make sure it's the people who are going to cover the...
[00:21:14.240 --> 00:21:17.240]   Look at the parts of it that we really, really want people to know about.
[00:21:17.240 --> 00:21:20.240]   What's the timing of the... What's the timing of the 10-R
[00:21:20.240 --> 00:21:22.240]   and the iPad Pro announcement?
[00:21:22.240 --> 00:21:24.240]   Will there be an iPad Pro announcement?
[00:21:24.240 --> 00:21:26.240]   Yeah, I think the 10 will be just before it.
[00:21:26.240 --> 00:21:27.240]   Just before it.
[00:21:27.240 --> 00:21:28.240]   Yeah.
[00:21:28.240 --> 00:21:29.240]   I think maybe...
[00:21:29.240 --> 00:21:30.240]   It won't be an event.
[00:21:30.240 --> 00:21:31.240]   It won't be an event.
[00:21:31.240 --> 00:21:32.240]   It won't be an event.
[00:21:32.240 --> 00:21:35.240]   There was this great Apple... This guy was working at Apple,
[00:21:35.240 --> 00:21:37.240]   then left Apple briefly, then went back to Apple
[00:21:37.240 --> 00:21:40.240]   and he had the best description I've ever heard of a relationship with Apple
[00:21:40.240 --> 00:21:43.240]   to people outside Apple, and that was just animal husbandry.
[00:21:43.240 --> 00:21:46.240]   It's entirely what... It's like what you can...
[00:21:46.240 --> 00:21:49.240]   Apple's there, and what... How does this help Apple?
[00:21:49.240 --> 00:21:50.240]   Yeah.
[00:21:50.240 --> 00:21:52.240]   And if like John Hamm reviewed the iPhone XS,
[00:21:52.240 --> 00:21:54.240]   I forget what magazine it was in, but it was literally...
[00:21:54.240 --> 00:21:56.240]   No, Apple watched the series 4. Sorry.
[00:21:56.240 --> 00:21:57.240]   The Star of Madman?
[00:21:57.240 --> 00:22:00.240]   Yeah, the Star of Madman was reviewing it for a magazine,
[00:22:00.240 --> 00:22:04.240]   and they know that John Hamm or Christy Brinkley is going to bring the millions more audience
[00:22:04.240 --> 00:22:06.240]   than someone like me, frankly.
[00:22:06.240 --> 00:22:07.240]   Yeah.
[00:22:07.240 --> 00:22:11.240]   And they'll submit not just millions more, but again, who are they not reaching?
[00:22:11.240 --> 00:22:14.240]   They will get a fashion... When the Apple watch came out,
[00:22:14.240 --> 00:22:17.240]   they reached out to a lot of fashion bloggers because they don't...
[00:22:17.240 --> 00:22:20.240]   Look at me. I'm wearing like a 10-year-old.
[00:22:20.240 --> 00:22:24.240]   I'm wearing the t-shirt that I slept in throwing a v-neck sweater over
[00:22:24.240 --> 00:22:26.240]   because I think it'll class it up.
[00:22:26.240 --> 00:22:29.240]   I'm not the person that you want like on a YouTube video and say,
[00:22:29.240 --> 00:22:32.240]   "Hey, dudes! I got this new watch. It looks really...
[00:22:32.240 --> 00:22:34.240]   It's $10,000, but..."
[00:22:34.240 --> 00:22:37.240]   But Beyonce and the pure gold watch, that sells.
[00:22:37.240 --> 00:22:40.240]   I wonder where that watch is today.
[00:22:40.240 --> 00:22:44.240]   I was going to say, Jay, I was going to say,
[00:22:44.240 --> 00:22:47.240]   "What's the new kind of need? Is something unspeakable with it?"
[00:22:47.240 --> 00:22:50.240]   That was a series zero, so it makes it completely useless.
[00:22:50.240 --> 00:22:51.240]   You can't even...
[00:22:51.240 --> 00:22:53.240]   They're hard to find, though. I keep looking for them,
[00:22:53.240 --> 00:22:55.240]   and it's really hard to find people who are partying with those.
[00:22:55.240 --> 00:22:58.240]   I think they've just been kept as collector's items or just for the gold value.
[00:22:58.240 --> 00:22:59.240]   Sure.
[00:22:59.240 --> 00:23:02.240]   Or they just don't know where they are.
[00:23:02.240 --> 00:23:06.240]   Not until they move, until they finally pull the drawers out of the dresser,
[00:23:06.240 --> 00:23:09.240]   saying, "Oh, that's right. I did buy one of those watches.
[00:23:09.240 --> 00:23:11.240]   I stopped wearing it after a month because...
[00:23:11.240 --> 00:23:14.240]   Sharon, where's that gold watch?
[00:23:14.240 --> 00:23:18.240]   This year, because this was the first year the original gold couldn't update to the new watch OS,
[00:23:18.240 --> 00:23:20.240]   so they needed a new gold.
[00:23:20.240 --> 00:23:22.240]   How much is the...
[00:23:22.240 --> 00:23:26.240]   I was saying they didn't make a premium version of the series four,
[00:23:26.240 --> 00:23:27.240]   but there isn't a Hermes version.
[00:23:27.240 --> 00:23:28.240]   How much is that?
[00:23:28.240 --> 00:23:29.240]   Is that a lot?
[00:23:29.240 --> 00:23:30.240]   That's like $1,500.
[00:23:30.240 --> 00:23:34.240]   You could still spend money if you really, for some reason, really want to.
[00:23:34.240 --> 00:23:35.240]   Yeah.
[00:23:35.240 --> 00:23:39.240]   Again, I keep saying this, but I go to the Hermes store every time I pass by SFO,
[00:23:39.240 --> 00:23:42.240]   and it's like, "Their bands are twice as expensive as Hermes bands for Apple Watch."
[00:23:42.240 --> 00:23:45.240]   So if you're a devout Hermes-Atienne...
[00:23:45.240 --> 00:23:47.240]   Sorry, Hermes, look at...
[00:23:47.240 --> 00:23:48.240]   Hermes.
[00:23:48.240 --> 00:23:49.240]   Hermes.
[00:23:49.240 --> 00:23:52.240]   Hermes-Atienne, you can go there and get a discount Apple Watch band.
[00:23:52.240 --> 00:23:56.240]   It was... I remember going into the Hermes store in Paris.
[00:23:56.240 --> 00:23:57.240]   It was quite an experience.
[00:23:57.240 --> 00:23:58.240]   Quite an experience.
[00:23:58.240 --> 00:24:01.240]   But that was back when it was just selling scarves.
[00:24:01.240 --> 00:24:06.240]   Let's take a little break, and we will come back with my little friends.
[00:24:06.240 --> 00:24:11.240]   Say hello to my little Alex Lindsay from the Pixel Quad.
[00:24:11.240 --> 00:24:15.240]   Mr. Renee Ritchie, say hello to my little friend from iMore.com.
[00:24:15.240 --> 00:24:16.240]   Bonjour!
[00:24:16.240 --> 00:24:17.240]   Bonjour!
[00:24:17.240 --> 00:24:18.240]   Bonjour!
[00:24:18.240 --> 00:24:19.240]   Come on, sir.
[00:24:19.240 --> 00:24:20.240]   Tada!
[00:24:20.240 --> 00:24:21.240]   Oh, yeah.
[00:24:21.240 --> 00:24:25.240]   Thank you, by the way, for all the Quebecois friends I have on Pokémon Go.
[00:24:25.240 --> 00:24:31.240]   I realize that at least half of my Pokémon Go friends are from your neck of the woods.
[00:24:31.240 --> 00:24:35.240]   Yeah, we're having a bunch of fun today because we had an election yesterday and a new party took over.
[00:24:35.240 --> 00:24:40.240]   Brand new party and their initials are CAQ, and you can't say it out loud without Americans laughing at you.
[00:24:40.240 --> 00:24:41.240]   Aha!
[00:24:41.240 --> 00:24:42.240]   Yes.
[00:24:42.240 --> 00:24:43.240]   He said CAQ...
[00:24:43.240 --> 00:24:44.240]   Everyone's 12 years old.
[00:24:44.240 --> 00:24:45.240]   Aha!
[00:24:45.240 --> 00:24:46.240]   Yeah.
[00:24:46.240 --> 00:24:47.240]   And...
[00:24:47.240 --> 00:24:48.240]   Yeah.
[00:24:48.240 --> 00:24:50.240]   Wait, little President gets a hold of that one.
[00:24:50.240 --> 00:24:51.240]   Oh, no.
[00:24:51.240 --> 00:24:52.240]   Oh, God.
[00:24:52.240 --> 00:24:53.240]   It's all off.
[00:24:53.240 --> 00:24:55.240]   I think the President has had a hold of that since inauguration.
[00:24:55.240 --> 00:24:58.240]   Oh, and that's Andy and I go.
[00:24:58.240 --> 00:25:01.240]   Oh, from WGBH, liberal radio.
[00:25:01.240 --> 00:25:02.240]   Boston.
[00:25:02.240 --> 00:25:04.240]   Don't get high on your own supply, Leo.
[00:25:04.240 --> 00:25:05.240]   Ha ha!
[00:25:05.240 --> 00:25:06.240]   I showed it, I brought to you by Slack.
[00:25:06.240 --> 00:25:08.240]   This is the way we communicate.
[00:25:08.240 --> 00:25:15.240]   Slack, where work happens, it's a collaboration hub for work, whatever work you do with Slack.
[00:25:15.240 --> 00:25:18.240]   The right people in your team are kept in the loop.
[00:25:18.240 --> 00:25:21.240]   The information they need is always at their fingertips.
[00:25:21.240 --> 00:25:23.240]   I am so happy.
[00:25:23.240 --> 00:25:27.240]   You know, we used HipChat for a while, and HipChat got merged with Slack.
[00:25:27.240 --> 00:25:32.240]   So we jumped on the Slack wagon, and we're very happy.
[00:25:32.240 --> 00:25:34.240]   Here's our Twit.TV Slack channel.
[00:25:34.240 --> 00:25:39.240]   Just to prove I'm not making it up, we've got channels for all the shows.
[00:25:39.240 --> 00:25:42.240]   Conversations going on.
[00:25:42.240 --> 00:25:48.240]   Look, Megan Maroney sent a little animated GIF to you, Carsten.
[00:25:48.240 --> 00:25:54.240]   And it's all fun and games on Slack, except work's getting done too.
[00:25:54.240 --> 00:25:58.240]   And the nice thing about Slack is it's better than email.
[00:25:58.240 --> 00:26:06.240]   It's more immediate, it's faster than email, but they have a lot of nice features that also make it friendly to you as a user.
[00:26:06.240 --> 00:26:10.240]   For instance, the ability to say, "Hey, I'm going to be offline.
[00:26:10.240 --> 00:26:12.240]   I don't work in the evenings."
[00:26:12.240 --> 00:26:13.240]   That kind of thing.
[00:26:13.240 --> 00:26:16.240]   Just really is awesome.
[00:26:16.240 --> 00:26:20.240]   You can keep track of all your messages going back in time.
[00:26:20.240 --> 00:26:24.240]   So if there's any questions or rise, you've got it all.
[00:26:24.240 --> 00:26:30.240]   And by the way, one of the reasons we really were happy to go with Slack is all the integrations.
[00:26:30.240 --> 00:26:42.240]   Slack is integrated for us with all of the devices and things like Panopt and Atlassian and all the stuff we use.
[00:26:42.240 --> 00:26:45.240]   So that it's part of our workflow.
[00:26:45.240 --> 00:26:47.240]   It's a partner with us.
[00:26:47.240 --> 00:26:52.240]   No more searching for emails for follow-ups, searching through multiple systems to find what you're looking for.
[00:26:52.240 --> 00:26:55.240]   No more multiple tabs and platforms to keep updated.
[00:26:55.240 --> 00:27:03.240]   If you use Salesforce, Zendex, Google Drive, JIRA, they all integrate a thousand apps integrate with Slack.
[00:27:03.240 --> 00:27:06.240]   With mobile apps for iOS and Android, they sync as well.
[00:27:06.240 --> 00:27:09.240]   You can always pick up where you left off, no matter where you are.
[00:27:09.240 --> 00:27:13.240]   And your data is 100% encrypted and secure.
[00:27:13.240 --> 00:27:16.240]   With Slack, your team is better connected.
[00:27:16.240 --> 00:27:19.240]   I know ours is slack.com.
[00:27:19.240 --> 00:27:23.240]   SLACK.com.
[00:27:23.240 --> 00:27:25.240]   Check it out.
[00:27:25.240 --> 00:27:27.240]   Wear work happens.
[00:27:27.240 --> 00:27:28.240]   Say again?
[00:27:28.240 --> 00:27:36.240]   I'm always amazed that, like, after since we got into Slack years ago, and I'm like, I can't believe I'm running a whole company on my phone.
[00:27:36.240 --> 00:27:39.240]   You know, you just sit there and you're following up with everything kind of management all.
[00:27:39.240 --> 00:27:40.240]   That's awesome.
[00:27:40.240 --> 00:27:44.240]   The Coa de Sion, Futu Kebec.
[00:27:44.240 --> 00:27:47.240]   Kebec is not run by the Kec.
[00:27:47.240 --> 00:27:48.240]   The Kec.
[00:27:48.240 --> 00:27:49.240]   Yeah.
[00:27:49.240 --> 00:27:59.240]   ITC Judge, speaking of internationalism, International Trade Commission Judge, which is, despite its name, a U.S. Trade Organization.
[00:27:59.240 --> 00:28:00.240]   Like the World Series, Leo.
[00:28:00.240 --> 00:28:02.240]   Yeah, we own it all.
[00:28:02.240 --> 00:28:17.240]   Declined to block the importation of iPhones with Intel chips, even though he said that Apple's phones do infringe one of Qualcomm's patents.
[00:28:17.240 --> 00:28:22.240]   Qualcomm had asked the judge to block iPhone importation in the United States.
[00:28:22.240 --> 00:28:28.240]   He said that, quote, the judge said, quote, public interest factors way against granting Qualcomm's request for a ban.
[00:28:28.240 --> 00:28:30.240]   It will be reviewed by other judges.
[00:28:30.240 --> 00:28:36.240]   Apple said in a statement that Qualcomm unfairly demanded royalties for technologies that had nothing to do with.
[00:28:36.240 --> 00:28:45.240]   We're glad the ITC stopped Qualcomm's attempt to damage competition and ultimately harm innovators and U.S. consumers.
[00:28:45.240 --> 00:28:47.240]   And to kickdogs and burn down.
[00:28:47.240 --> 00:28:48.240]   Yes.
[00:28:48.240 --> 00:28:55.240]   I wonder how much, like, maybe Qualcomm's going to come out with this, but I was like, it's cost them when Apple decided they don't want to play anymore with Qualcomm.
[00:28:55.240 --> 00:28:58.240]   Because it's got to be costing more than any damages they're going to get from Apple.
[00:28:58.240 --> 00:28:59.240]   You know, it is.
[00:28:59.240 --> 00:29:00.240]   I think billions of dollars.
[00:29:00.240 --> 00:29:04.240]   Sometimes these things become principal more than money.
[00:29:04.240 --> 00:29:05.240]   Well, that's a lot of money to be.
[00:29:05.240 --> 00:29:07.240]   I think it's quarter of Qualcomm's business.
[00:29:07.240 --> 00:29:08.240]   I mean, they're not a chip company.
[00:29:08.240 --> 00:29:11.240]   They make chips, but they are a patent licensing company.
[00:29:11.240 --> 00:29:13.240]   And it's not just Apple.
[00:29:13.240 --> 00:29:15.240]   Like there have been governments who've gone after them.
[00:29:15.240 --> 00:29:19.240]   Taiwan, Korea, the EU over some of their deals.
[00:29:19.240 --> 00:29:21.240]   And there's like Huawei.
[00:29:21.240 --> 00:29:23.240]   I think there's at least two companies that are suing them.
[00:29:23.240 --> 00:29:25.240]   They keep the second company's name out of the headlines.
[00:29:25.240 --> 00:29:28.240]   But speculation is it's Huawei and there might be more.
[00:29:28.240 --> 00:29:31.240]   And Qualcomm has been getting a percentage of the retail.
[00:29:31.240 --> 00:29:34.240]   I think it's like 5% of the retail cost of the device.
[00:29:34.240 --> 00:29:36.240]   They don't just want money for their technology.
[00:29:36.240 --> 00:29:37.240]   They want a piece of the action.
[00:29:37.240 --> 00:29:39.240]   And that doesn't scale.
[00:29:39.240 --> 00:29:44.240]   And as you know, they argue that the modem is so important, but there's so many important objects on a phone these days.
[00:29:44.240 --> 00:29:52.240]   And I think they're afraid that if Apple breaks through the way Apple broke through with the carriers, their entire business is going to go, you know, that was a really great business.
[00:29:52.240 --> 00:29:53.240]   Super happy business for Qualcomm.
[00:29:53.240 --> 00:29:59.240]   And I think they're afraid that those sort of glory days will be over if they don't hold onto this as tightly as possible.
[00:29:59.240 --> 00:30:09.240]   Wouldn't you argue though that Apple in getting rid of Qualcomm chips and choosing Intel chips has chosen something, at least for the time being something that's technologically inferior.
[00:30:09.240 --> 00:30:12.240]   Those Intel modems are a lot slower.
[00:30:12.240 --> 00:30:13.240]   Yeah.
[00:30:13.240 --> 00:30:21.240]   The problem is that Qualcomm's product is having done such a good job on modems that, you know, it's not a good job.
[00:30:21.240 --> 00:30:34.240]   But it's not a good job on modems that if you basically put, if you put their silicon in, if you put their code and their technology in your phone, you're not going to have to worry about where this person decides to carry it or where you, where you decide to sell it.
[00:30:34.240 --> 00:30:36.240]   And that's the value of their company.
[00:30:36.240 --> 00:30:42.240]   That's part of it is part of it is acquiring patents, but a lot of it is making sure that's all integrated into the system.
[00:30:42.240 --> 00:30:55.240]   So to make sure that once again, you don't have a VHS versus beta versus whatever that other third video tape format was in Great Britain that I only found out about because techno did a wonderful video about it.
[00:30:55.240 --> 00:31:10.240]   It's a they do add value, but the problem is that they're running into the band aid situation where they have made they have a product now that is too important and also they've been doing too good a job protecting it such that they're the argument can now be made that the world can't really continue.
[00:31:10.240 --> 00:31:14.240]   If Qualcomm has the ability to ice an entire phone platform.
[00:31:14.240 --> 00:31:33.240]   So for everything that Apple said, they still got a judgment handed against them saying that yes, you are infringing on Paul comes patents, but it was more dire for Qualcomm because the judge pretty much said that pretty much said to every phone maker go ahead, put Qualcomm, put in fringe Qualcomm's patents.
[00:31:33.240 --> 00:31:39.240]   All you want the we are not the worst that's going to happen is that we'll ask you to write Qualcomm a check.
[00:31:39.240 --> 00:31:43.240]   We are never we are not going to ask you to stop making that phone.
[00:31:43.240 --> 00:31:46.240]   Before they just didn't want to write as big a check as they were.
[00:31:46.240 --> 00:31:48.240]   That was Qualcomm's reaction.
[00:31:48.240 --> 00:31:50.240]   They said it makes no sense.
[00:31:50.240 --> 00:31:56.240]   If you find patent infringement as the judge did to then allow infringement to continue by denying an import band.
[00:31:56.240 --> 00:32:04.240]   This is Qualcomm General counsel Don Rosenberg that goes against the ITC mandate to protect American innovators by blocking the import of infringing products.
[00:32:04.240 --> 00:32:14.240]   It's so crazy that Samsung who makes their own Exynos processor ends up shipping Qualcomm processors in half their phones just because Qualcomm is such a giant paid in the dairy air to deal with.
[00:32:14.240 --> 00:32:17.240]   Well, maybe I don't know.
[00:32:17.240 --> 00:32:23.240]   I mean, I really think it's my 845 Snapdragon 845.
[00:32:23.240 --> 00:32:25.240]   I know, but I think it's five.
[00:32:25.240 --> 00:32:26.240]   Samsung comes along.
[00:32:26.240 --> 00:32:27.240]   This is going to be an even bigger.
[00:32:27.240 --> 00:32:31.240]   Samsung could be integrated all the way to the Silicon the way Apple is, but they can't because they can't.
[00:32:31.240 --> 00:32:33.240]   They don't know which process of your phone is going to happen to run.
[00:32:33.240 --> 00:32:34.240]   Right.
[00:32:34.240 --> 00:32:38.240]   Well, I wonder if they're going to be emboldened by this decision and it might say, yeah, you hope so.
[00:32:38.240 --> 00:32:44.240]   They could, but this is this is a problem that it extends way beyond this one platform or this one lawsuit.
[00:32:44.240 --> 00:32:52.240]   It's a it's a problem that Google is now facing where unfortunately they did such a great job building their search engine that although they're all alternatives.
[00:32:52.240 --> 00:33:01.240]   They're it's it's hard to imagine another company building a product that's so good that takes so many years to steep in the crockpot.
[00:33:01.240 --> 00:33:08.240]   But to get those to get that kind of quality and really being the number one go to choice for search anymore.
[00:33:08.240 --> 00:33:21.240]   So then you have a problem of well, if you have because of your own success, whether it was through Skaldugger or not, if you have created a what when it stopped being a product and started being part of infrastructure,
[00:33:21.240 --> 00:33:25.240]   do you now have responsibilities to make that infrastructure as wide as possible?
[00:33:25.240 --> 00:33:26.240]   Right as possible.
[00:33:26.240 --> 00:33:32.240]   So there are some I believe that there are I had a lawyer explain this to me two months ago.
[00:33:32.240 --> 00:33:38.240]   So I'm going to speak as though this is just something I wrote as I saw as graffiti on a wall somewhere.
[00:33:38.240 --> 00:33:45.240]   But there is there is there is the equivalent of like an eminent domain sort of thing, which is not supposed to be used indiscriminately.
[00:33:45.240 --> 00:33:55.240]   But it is possible to simply say, sorry, I know that I know that you I know that you did this really, really great job inventing this way of putting signals across copper wire.
[00:33:55.240 --> 00:34:11.240]   But now that everybody uses that for everything, we're going to have to basically buy you buy your patent for you and make it impossible for you to continue to make money off of this because we can't start we can't you're engaging in practices and make it impossible for someone to get service in a place
[00:34:11.240 --> 00:34:17.240]   that's not profitable get service from. But that's the way that we get people to to call 911.
[00:34:17.240 --> 00:34:20.240]   So we we're not giving you the option of not running a profitable company.
[00:34:20.240 --> 00:34:23.240]   So we have to take some of your IP from you.
[00:34:23.240 --> 00:34:32.240]   Another another company is not too happy is Intel, which in a blog post said Qualcomm has publicly disparaged Intel's products as inferior.
[00:34:32.240 --> 00:34:37.240]   Well, okay, maybe they are they didn't defend that.
[00:34:37.240 --> 00:34:40.240]   He said it's easy to say things, but Intel's track record is clear.
[00:34:40.240 --> 00:34:45.240]   Every day we push the boundaries of computing and communication technologies and the proof is in the pudding.
[00:34:45.240 --> 00:34:49.240]   Last year, the US patent office awarded more patents to Intel than to Qualcomm.
[00:34:49.240 --> 00:34:53.240]   Okay, but the size of their patents.
[00:34:53.240 --> 00:35:04.240]   I mean, like this happens in every industry like like Google had to use LG displays and pixels as there weren't enough Samsung panels and Apple and Google are investing billions of dollars to make LG make better.
[00:35:04.240 --> 00:35:07.240]   Oh, hit panels because the world actually needs more.
[00:35:07.240 --> 00:35:08.240]   Right. Right.
[00:35:08.240 --> 00:35:15.240]   And that's and that's a good thing. If you're shut out of the fact that Qualcomm is being such jerks means that Intel now has an opening.
[00:35:15.240 --> 00:35:23.240]   If the first if the first page that I'm not going to brochure is now to deal with deal with us, we're not as good as Qualcomm, but we're not jerks to work with.
[00:35:23.240 --> 00:35:26.240]   And we're getting we're solving these problems that will give you diversity.
[00:35:26.240 --> 00:35:34.240]   Just like duck duck go is such a great alternative to Google because of the things that are annoying about using the Google search product.
[00:35:34.240 --> 00:35:51.240]   And I think that one of the things I mean, this is the bigger question about patents at some point is the original, my understanding at least the original idea behind a patent was that the inventor was given a certain amount of time to make money with that patent and then it was put into the into the public, you know, in domain.
[00:35:51.240 --> 00:35:58.240]   But the idea was to give someone the chance to make it themselves, not to right, you know, like, you know, so that they get some time.
[00:35:58.240 --> 00:36:07.240]   You get you get 12 years or whatever it is, whatever the term is these days to reap the benefits, but then because you patented it, the process is put into the public domain.
[00:36:07.240 --> 00:36:08.240]   Everybody understands how it works.
[00:36:08.240 --> 00:36:19.240]   And this is slightly different because these are technologies that everybody need if you if they pick your patent to be part of the standard for that technology, everybody has to be able to apply to that standard.
[00:36:19.240 --> 00:36:22.240]   So you're supposed to do reasonable access.
[00:36:22.240 --> 00:36:26.240]   It was a non different non risk, non discriminatory access to it.
[00:36:26.240 --> 00:36:29.240]   And that's where I think the argument is, you know, Apple says they have to pay Qualcomm money.
[00:36:29.240 --> 00:36:31.240]   Qualcomm says Apple has to pay them money.
[00:36:31.240 --> 00:36:34.240]   Apple is saying Qualcomm is asking for an unreasonable amount of money.
[00:36:34.240 --> 00:36:35.240]   Right.
[00:36:35.240 --> 00:36:37.240]   That's basically it boil it all down.
[00:36:37.240 --> 00:36:38.240]   And it's going to go back and forth and forth.
[00:36:38.240 --> 00:36:39.240]   It all boils down.
[00:36:39.240 --> 00:36:46.240]   And I think part of the reason they're not stopping shipments is because the judge knows this is going to go back in, you know, we're going to go through like six more appeals and.
[00:36:46.240 --> 00:36:48.240]   But Apple's withholding billions.
[00:36:48.240 --> 00:36:50.240]   I mean, that's that's that hurts Qualcomm badly.
[00:36:50.240 --> 00:36:53.240]   So I think they have every incentive to fight this hard.
[00:36:53.240 --> 00:36:54.240]   Right.
[00:36:54.240 --> 00:36:56.240]   Speaking of patents, Apple has won on an appeal.
[00:36:56.240 --> 00:37:01.240]   Apple had lost a court battle with the University of Wisconsin.
[00:37:01.240 --> 00:37:03.240]   Madison.
[00:37:03.240 --> 00:37:10.240]   They filed suit in 2014 saying that several iPhone and iPad processors use technology that was developed at the University of Wisconsin.
[00:37:10.240 --> 00:37:22.240]   A jury gave them an award of I think 234 million and then another 272 million added to that fine.
[00:37:22.240 --> 00:37:27.240]   So it was I was more than half a billion dollars at at risk.
[00:37:27.240 --> 00:37:37.240]   A judge, a federal appeals court has now overturned that court ruling saying, well, no, Apple didn't infringe.
[00:37:37.240 --> 00:37:40.240]   And and this is the standard you need to overturn.
[00:37:40.240 --> 00:37:45.240]   No reasonable juror could have found infringement effectively saying that jury was wrong.
[00:37:45.240 --> 00:37:52.240]   So Apple's happy they have appealed a fairly hefty patent dispute and.
[00:37:52.240 --> 00:37:55.240]   Meanwhile, the FaceTime one, I think is still going on in the rocket docket.
[00:37:55.240 --> 00:37:57.240]   I mean, like you in some you lose.
[00:37:57.240 --> 00:37:59.240]   It's, you know, I understand the need for this.
[00:37:59.240 --> 00:38:04.240]   And it's a shame that so much energy gets put into it and so much money and so much innovation is stymied.
[00:38:04.240 --> 00:38:17.240]   It's the non practicing like if a company or an inventor is doing something amazing with technology, but it's a lot of the companies that amass vast amount of patents and then apply them in very like this is the fax machine patent, but we're going to stop you from using FaceTime.
[00:38:17.240 --> 00:38:18.240]   That's terrible.
[00:38:18.240 --> 00:38:23.240]   Although I think the University of Wisconsin patent is because of something that was actually invented it.
[00:38:23.240 --> 00:38:33.240]   Well, and what happens with a lot of these with a lot of the educational institutions is you know, you're spending a lot of time coming up with new ideas, working on stuff that people haven't, especially in a university, you can work with a lot of people.
[00:38:33.240 --> 00:38:37.240]   And when you're in university, you can work on things that don't have commercial viability yet.
[00:38:37.240 --> 00:38:48.240]   And one of the ways that you underwrite some of that that work is that you do either provisional patenting for the next year or you do or file a provisional application or you actually do the patent.
[00:38:48.240 --> 00:38:59.240]   And that you hope that some of those things come back and some universities, especially California state universities have made a lot of money.
[00:38:59.240 --> 00:39:05.240]   Oh, you know, like Stanford has, you know, Google money because it was invented in Stanford.
[00:39:05.240 --> 00:39:06.240]   It doesn't hurt.
[00:39:06.240 --> 00:39:12.240]   Yeah. Yeah. So there's a lot of there's a lot of money that goes back into these universities that I don't know if the students get any benefit from that.
[00:39:12.240 --> 00:39:16.240]   But the, but the organization is able to build some more shiny buildings.
[00:39:16.240 --> 00:39:20.240]   Hey, basketball team still cannot accept a free candy bar.
[00:39:20.240 --> 00:39:21.240]   Exactly.
[00:39:21.240 --> 00:39:30.240]   We talked last week, I think, or maybe the week before Megan Maroney was at the Apple Store in up here in Santa Rosa when it was robbed.
[00:39:30.240 --> 00:39:32.240]   The second theft there.
[00:39:32.240 --> 00:39:38.240]   They've been robbing robberies all over California warrants for 17 people were issued a race.
[00:39:38.240 --> 00:39:48.240]   Arets have already started today for a ring, a ring of people had robbed Apple stores in 19 counties.
[00:39:48.240 --> 00:39:51.240]   More than a million dollars worth of Apple goods were stolen.
[00:39:51.240 --> 00:39:59.240]   The robbers were known for wearing hoodies and storming in large groups to snap up products on display in a matter of seconds.
[00:39:59.240 --> 00:40:01.240]   That's what happened in the Santa Rosa store.
[00:40:01.240 --> 00:40:06.240]   Seven of those involved there are 17 warrants, but seven of those involved have already been arrested.
[00:40:06.240 --> 00:40:08.240]   Seems like there's a bunch of cameras there.
[00:40:08.240 --> 00:40:09.240]   There's a bunch of stuff there.
[00:40:09.240 --> 00:40:11.240]   Like, how do you think your access is actually going to turn out?
[00:40:11.240 --> 00:40:17.240]   Like, well, no, it's a very smart play because most stores, I think Apple Store included.
[00:40:17.240 --> 00:40:22.240]   The staff has said, if someone is trying to steal product, let them steal.
[00:40:22.240 --> 00:40:25.240]   And they clearly are interested in getting in and getting out fast.
[00:40:25.240 --> 00:40:27.240]   Let them get in and get out fast.
[00:40:27.240 --> 00:40:28.240]   Oh, sure.
[00:40:28.240 --> 00:40:29.240]   I mean, now that...
[00:40:29.240 --> 00:40:30.240]   That's true in a bank too.
[00:40:30.240 --> 00:40:31.240]   You're never told.
[00:40:31.240 --> 00:40:35.240]   I remember when I was in a record store, they said, "If somebody steals a record, that's okay.
[00:40:35.240 --> 00:40:36.240]   Let them walk out.
[00:40:36.240 --> 00:40:38.240]   Don't risk your life."
[00:40:38.240 --> 00:40:40.240]   And there's a thriving market for parts.
[00:40:40.240 --> 00:40:46.240]   So the fact that these things are all device managed and probably are going to be on full lockdown.
[00:40:46.240 --> 00:40:50.240]   The moment they leave the store, that's okay because they're just going to be taken apart and parted out anyway.
[00:40:50.240 --> 00:40:55.240]   The fact is, it wouldn't happen if these things wouldn't happen if it weren't a good business decision.
[00:40:55.240 --> 00:41:00.240]   You're not looking at like crackheads that are just doing super crimes.
[00:41:00.240 --> 00:41:01.240]   No, it's a good business decision.
[00:41:01.240 --> 00:41:02.240]   I'm just saying that.
[00:41:02.240 --> 00:41:03.240]   I mean, if I'm in jail.
[00:41:03.240 --> 00:41:07.240]   Well, I was saying a lot of them still at large, but probably you're going to be in jail.
[00:41:07.240 --> 00:41:09.240]   I don't know how good a business decision this was.
[00:41:09.240 --> 00:41:13.240]   Well, it wouldn't be widespread if there wasn't a big upside.
[00:41:13.240 --> 00:41:14.240]   It wasn't an easy thing to do.
[00:41:14.240 --> 00:41:16.240]   All you do is an upside.
[00:41:16.240 --> 00:41:22.240]   It's an upside for the guy who probably won't get caught, who they didn't even know who it was, who they supplied the parts to.
[00:41:22.240 --> 00:41:23.240]   That was a great business.
[00:41:23.240 --> 00:41:24.240]   Hell, it cooled.
[00:41:24.240 --> 00:41:26.240]   He's going to get away with it.
[00:41:26.240 --> 00:41:27.240]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:41:27.240 --> 00:41:29.240]   It's not so much for the guys going into the store.
[00:41:29.240 --> 00:41:31.240]   That's not a good business model for them.
[00:41:31.240 --> 00:41:35.240]   I don't know if anybody got that reference, but I don't know.
[00:41:35.240 --> 00:41:36.240]   Again, I got that.
[00:41:36.240 --> 00:41:37.240]   You got it.
[00:41:37.240 --> 00:41:43.240]   Yeah, I'm going to get a little bit of the money.
[00:41:43.240 --> 00:41:46.240]   I'm going to get a little bit of money.
[00:41:46.240 --> 00:41:48.240]   I'm going to get a little bit of money.
[00:41:48.240 --> 00:41:50.240]   I'm going to get a little bit of money.
[00:41:50.240 --> 00:41:52.240]   I'm going to get a little bit of money.

[00:43:04.240 --> 00:43:05.240]   I'm going to get a little bit of money.
[00:43:05.240 --> 00:43:06.240]   I'm going to get a little bit of money.
[00:43:06.240 --> 00:43:13.240]   I'm going to get a little bit of money.
[00:43:13.240 --> 00:43:14.240]   I'm going to get a little bit of money.
[00:43:14.240 --> 00:43:15.240]   I'm going to get a little bit of money.
[00:43:15.240 --> 00:43:16.240]   I'm going to get a little bit of money.
[00:43:16.240 --> 00:43:17.240]   I'm going to get a little bit of money.
[00:43:17.240 --> 00:43:18.240]   I'm going to get a little bit of money.
[00:43:18.240 --> 00:43:19.240]   I'm going to get a little bit of money.
[00:43:19.240 --> 00:43:20.240]   I'm going to get a little bit of money.
[00:43:20.240 --> 00:43:21.240]   I'm going to get a little bit of money.
[00:43:21.240 --> 00:43:22.240]   I'm going to get a little bit of money.
[00:43:22.240 --> 00:43:23.240]   I'm going to get a little bit of money.
[00:43:23.240 --> 00:43:24.240]   I'm going to get a little bit of money.
[00:43:24.240 --> 00:43:25.240]   I'm going to get a little bit of money.
[00:43:25.240 --> 00:43:26.240]   I'm going to get a little bit of money.
[00:43:26.240 --> 00:43:27.240]   I'm going to get a little bit of money.
[00:43:27.240 --> 00:43:28.240]   I'm going to get a little bit of money.
[00:43:28.240 --> 00:43:34.240]   Social tech, the owners of it, said an unknown person inquired about buying the rights in
[00:43:34.240 --> 00:43:38.240]   May, just two weeks prior to Apple's Memoji debut.
[00:43:38.240 --> 00:43:43.240]   He was told the Memoji name is not for sale.
[00:43:43.240 --> 00:43:45.240]   Anyway, this is in court.
[00:43:45.240 --> 00:43:47.240]   That's where you go when you have dispute like this.
[00:43:47.240 --> 00:43:51.240]   Better than getting fights in the bar.
[00:43:51.240 --> 00:43:53.240]   There's a lot of that going around.
[00:43:53.240 --> 00:43:57.240]   I've seen a lot of that in smaller stakes where people do a form of violence.
[00:43:57.240 --> 00:44:01.240]   They do a form of insider trading where they work for a very, very large company.
[00:44:01.240 --> 00:44:05.240]   They know that they're trying to decide between these 11 names.
[00:44:05.240 --> 00:44:07.240]   They decide that, what if we were to register this?
[00:44:07.240 --> 00:44:11.240]   Or what if I were to tell my cousin, the lawyer, to create a company and register this as a
[00:44:11.240 --> 00:44:16.240]   trademark before they get that, they might be able to, for $18,000 for the startup cost,
[00:44:16.240 --> 00:44:21.240]   they might be able to get a $50,000 go away settlement.
[00:44:21.240 --> 00:44:23.240]   This stuff is crazy.
[00:44:23.240 --> 00:44:28.240]   The weakness though is that people don't realize that unless you're chasing after Apple money,
[00:44:28.240 --> 00:44:35.240]   the likelihood that someone will just make up a different name and say, well, if you try
[00:44:35.240 --> 00:44:41.240]   to float them from $5,000 to $30,000 and so on and so on, well, the difference between
[00:44:41.240 --> 00:44:48.240]   $5,000 and $30,000 is us just simply calling our new web processor Gomonsk.
[00:44:48.240 --> 00:44:52.240]   You have a great name, but our software is better than the name.
[00:44:52.240 --> 00:44:57.240]   If you've tried to acquire a domain name, we've tried to acquire domain names for Twit,
[00:44:57.240 --> 00:45:01.240]   and we don't want to come in as Twit because we're afraid people will hold us up.
[00:45:01.240 --> 00:45:03.240]   So you don't come in as Twit.
[00:45:03.240 --> 00:45:04.240]   You get somebody else's name.
[00:45:04.240 --> 00:45:07.240]   The alternative is like we have Apple Wallet and Google Wallet and Microsoft Wallet, a bunch of just
[00:45:07.240 --> 00:45:10.240]   bland generics and nobody really cares about that.
[00:45:10.240 --> 00:45:11.240]   Right.
[00:45:11.240 --> 00:45:16.240]   But it is kind of tragic because you see what breaks my heart is when you see these people
[00:45:16.240 --> 00:45:21.240]   who are kind of chislers where it's like, hey, this domain name is par.
[00:45:21.240 --> 00:45:23.240]   It's not making money for anybody.
[00:45:23.240 --> 00:45:26.240]   It's not doing anything productive.
[00:45:26.240 --> 00:45:32.240]   And I have a cool idea for something that I want to do and it's actually going to be used
[00:45:32.240 --> 00:45:35.240]   and it's perfect for this application and I'm willing to give you a fair amount of money
[00:45:35.240 --> 00:45:36.240]   for it.
[00:45:36.240 --> 00:45:43.240]   And so, I kind of offer is $30,000 and you have to come back and say, I'm going to -- I offer
[00:45:43.240 --> 00:45:44.240]   you $5,000.
[00:45:44.240 --> 00:45:46.240]   That is literally my top.
[00:45:46.240 --> 00:45:50.240]   And you not have the choice between getting $5,000 for this domain or nothing.
[00:45:50.240 --> 00:45:52.240]   For another eight years.
[00:45:52.240 --> 00:45:57.240]   And it's amazing how many companies will just say, no, that's our final offer.
[00:45:57.240 --> 00:46:06.240]   Thinking that my lightbulbstorefront.net is going to be the next name of Pixar's next
[00:46:06.240 --> 00:46:09.240]   big movie and that's who you're really dealing with.
[00:46:09.240 --> 00:46:12.240]   And you've really got to hold them up by the -- like, oh, man.
[00:46:12.240 --> 00:46:17.240]   And that's why really good domain names go to -- this domain name is for sale.
[00:46:17.240 --> 00:46:18.240]   That annoys me.
[00:46:18.240 --> 00:46:20.240]   Leo.com.
[00:46:20.240 --> 00:46:22.240]   Can't get it.
[00:46:22.240 --> 00:46:23.240]   So wait on it.
[00:46:23.240 --> 00:46:24.240]   So wait on it.
[00:46:24.240 --> 00:46:26.240]   Yeah, I didn't know this.
[00:46:26.240 --> 00:46:31.240]   I've had so many offers for C-W-O-B.com just because it's a four-letter domain.
[00:46:31.240 --> 00:46:32.240]   Really?
[00:46:32.240 --> 00:46:35.240]   And not because people have any need for it.
[00:46:35.240 --> 00:46:39.240]   It's just that they want -- they feel as though because this is an old domain.
[00:46:39.240 --> 00:46:43.240]   Maybe someone's forgotten about it and they can just offer somebody $500 for it and get
[00:46:43.240 --> 00:46:44.240]   it.
[00:46:44.240 --> 00:46:51.240]   Okay, it's not -- if you're willing to like vest my -- vest -- 20% of my retirement fund
[00:46:51.240 --> 00:46:54.240]   with an offer, okay, I'll listen.
[00:46:54.240 --> 00:46:55.240]   But it's like --
[00:46:55.240 --> 00:47:04.240]   Well, I didn't know this Final Cut Pro X did not have official EGPU support until Mojave
[00:47:04.240 --> 00:47:05.240]   came out.
[00:47:05.240 --> 00:47:06.240]   Yep.
[00:47:06.240 --> 00:47:09.240]   As an EGPU owner, I'm glad to see there's now a checkbox.
[00:47:09.240 --> 00:47:14.040]   One thing I have noticed is it feels like Final Cut to some degree but compressor to
[00:47:14.040 --> 00:47:17.040]   a huge degree is much slower in Mojave.
[00:47:17.040 --> 00:47:18.040]   So is it?
[00:47:18.040 --> 00:47:21.040]   I'm assuming that we're going to get some kind of update.
[00:47:21.040 --> 00:47:29.320]   It feels like it's not using the extra instance of the processor but it is -- and I'm not
[00:47:29.320 --> 00:47:35.040]   sure if I'm -- you know, like I just used things going at a certain multiplier and it
[00:47:35.040 --> 00:47:41.040]   is what I expect to happen in minutes is happening in sometimes almost an hour.
[00:47:41.040 --> 00:47:44.040]   It is just -- it's something -- something's off.
[00:47:44.040 --> 00:47:47.040]   I'm still on high Sierra on my Final Cut Pro X.
[00:47:47.040 --> 00:47:52.040]   Yeah, I don't think I'm going to change my lap -- based on my -- here's my laptop.
[00:47:52.040 --> 00:47:57.040]   I don't think I'm going to jump to Mojave for a Final Cut thing just quite yet.
[00:47:57.040 --> 00:48:00.640]   If I'm using compressor a lot -- if you're using compressor a lot, which I do like a lot
[00:48:00.640 --> 00:48:02.640]   as far from a compression perspective.
[00:48:02.640 --> 00:48:04.440]   I'm not at that level yet.
[00:48:04.440 --> 00:48:08.040]   Something is -- something feels about it.
[00:48:08.040 --> 00:48:11.040]   I'm at the share button level, Andy.
[00:48:11.040 --> 00:48:13.040]   I'm not at the Alex Lindsey compressor level yet.
[00:48:13.040 --> 00:48:15.040]   Great article on the halide blog.
[00:48:15.040 --> 00:48:16.040]   We love halide.
[00:48:16.040 --> 00:48:19.040]   It's a third-party camera for Apple iPhones.
[00:48:19.040 --> 00:48:21.040]   It's just a little bit of background here.
[00:48:21.040 --> 00:48:25.320]   Sebastian DeWitt, who's a designer who wrote this, he was the one in charge of doing Stitched
[00:48:25.320 --> 00:48:29.040]   Leather from Steve Jobs' airplane for Find My Friends Apple.
[00:48:29.040 --> 00:48:32.840]   And as the designer of Double Twist was the first person I believed to anti-aliased
[00:48:32.840 --> 00:48:39.840]   pentile displays, so he knows of which he speaks.
[00:48:39.840 --> 00:48:40.840]   Wow.
[00:48:40.840 --> 00:48:41.840]   And he's the designer of halide.
[00:48:41.840 --> 00:48:45.840]   Has a great article on what's new in the iPhone XS camera, but specifically addresses
[00:48:45.840 --> 00:48:50.840]   this issue about the soft filter on the selfies.
[00:48:50.840 --> 00:48:52.840]   He says it doesn't exist.
[00:48:52.840 --> 00:48:56.840]   I don't want to say that some people make up controversies to get YouTube impressions,
[00:48:56.840 --> 00:49:00.840]   but you do have to take things on the Internet with a grain of salt.
[00:49:00.840 --> 00:49:03.840]   It's just a smooth thing going on, enhancing going on.
[00:49:03.840 --> 00:49:07.840]   It's just not a beauty filter, and some people hope that if it was, Apple could give you
[00:49:07.840 --> 00:49:08.840]   an on/off button.
[00:49:08.840 --> 00:49:10.840]   But since it is not, they cannot give you an on/off button.
[00:49:10.840 --> 00:49:11.840]   It's part of the software.
[00:49:11.840 --> 00:49:14.840]   Is it doing the same thing on the front-facing camera as it's doing on the back?
[00:49:14.840 --> 00:49:17.840]   Yeah, so there's a couple of things that work there.
[00:49:17.840 --> 00:49:19.840]   He explains it really well.
[00:49:19.840 --> 00:49:22.840]   Matthew Panzerino had a series of tweets that also explained it really well.
[00:49:22.840 --> 00:49:27.840]   And my understanding after speaking to Apple a little bit about it is that there is, they
[00:49:27.840 --> 00:49:32.840]   have a completely new imaging pipeline everywhere from the sensor through the silicon and through
[00:49:32.840 --> 00:49:35.840]   everything that gets adjusted before they present to you the image.
[00:49:35.840 --> 00:49:38.840]   And it's doing a lot of very complicated things.
[00:49:38.840 --> 00:49:42.840]   One of the things is it's new HDR does get so much more detail in the highlights and so much
[00:49:42.840 --> 00:49:46.840]   more detail in the shadows, that there's less difference in the edges, which is something
[00:49:46.840 --> 00:49:50.840]   that traditionally you'd use to sharpen an image, to create greater contrast in the
[00:49:50.840 --> 00:49:52.840]   darks and lights right at the edges of objects.
[00:49:52.840 --> 00:49:56.840]   It also got rid of a ton of the noise, which people often thought was texture in the skin,
[00:49:56.840 --> 00:50:00.840]   and the banding, which gave it a lot of sort of a gritty realism to it.
[00:50:00.840 --> 00:50:05.840]   But it didn't, what Apple's done with some other things like rope and brick and clouds is
[00:50:05.840 --> 00:50:09.840]   to purposefully use AI to maintain a texture and to protect it even against compression
[00:50:09.840 --> 00:50:10.840]   artifacts.
[00:50:10.840 --> 00:50:11.840]   And they're not doing that with skin.
[00:50:11.840 --> 00:50:17.840]   I think that's a lot of what we're seeing is because they're shooting so fast, both the ISO
[00:50:17.840 --> 00:50:20.840]   and just the speed of the shutter, they're just shooting everything so fast.
[00:50:20.840 --> 00:50:21.840]   It's got massive amounts of noise.
[00:50:21.840 --> 00:50:25.840]   They're reducing that amount of noise to compensate and they're not retexturing it,
[00:50:25.840 --> 00:50:28.840]   so it ends up looking like this on a buttery stick.
[00:50:28.840 --> 00:50:29.840]   Here's an example.
[00:50:29.840 --> 00:50:33.840]   The two photos on the left are with the iPhone X.
[00:50:33.840 --> 00:50:34.840]   These are both raw.
[00:50:34.840 --> 00:50:40.840]   And the two on the right with iPhone XS, and you can see a lot more noise in the XS image.
[00:50:40.840 --> 00:50:45.840]   That's raw, though, because by the time you see it, the noise has been processed out.
[00:50:45.840 --> 00:50:51.840]   It's merged multiple four frames plus four frames of HDR plus a long exposure plus image
[00:50:51.840 --> 00:50:53.840]   and all sorts of other processing.
[00:50:53.840 --> 00:50:59.840]   So we used to, when we were working on matte paintings in a movie company I used to work
[00:50:59.840 --> 00:51:05.840]   for, one of the things that you would do is you'd run the camera a little longer.
[00:51:05.840 --> 00:51:07.840]   This is when we actually had film.
[00:51:07.840 --> 00:51:12.840]   And you would get, let's say, 10 frames of a couple seconds.
[00:51:12.840 --> 00:51:16.840]   You just grab 10 frames and you'd have one be 100 percent.
[00:51:16.840 --> 00:51:19.840]   The bottom one would be 100 percent and the next one would be 50 and then 25 and then
[00:51:19.840 --> 00:51:20.840]   12.5 and 6.25.
[00:51:20.840 --> 00:51:29.840]   And what it would do is it would basically average out everything that was different about the
[00:51:29.840 --> 00:51:30.840]   image.
[00:51:30.840 --> 00:51:32.840]   You're theoretically, it's the same image that you're looking at.
[00:51:32.840 --> 00:51:33.840]   You couldn't do it with people moving.
[00:51:33.840 --> 00:51:37.840]   It was just something that you did when everything's still, but it would get rid of all the grain.
[00:51:37.840 --> 00:51:41.840]   And that way you could add stuff to it and then add the grain back on top of it and then it would
[00:51:41.840 --> 00:51:45.840]   look like it was all part of the same thing and you wouldn't have grain building up.
[00:51:45.840 --> 00:51:50.840]   The thing that I think my theory looking at this is that Apple's taking a whole bunch of
[00:51:50.840 --> 00:51:54.840]   photos and they're taking them at very high speed, which means it's going to be grainier,
[00:51:54.840 --> 00:51:56.840]   there's going to be more ratta in the chip.
[00:51:56.840 --> 00:52:00.840]   But at the same time, it's moving just ever so slightly because you're not, as a person,
[00:52:00.840 --> 00:52:02.840]   not completely still.
[00:52:02.840 --> 00:52:07.840]   And so as it averages those out, some of those fine details, which I'm sure they're still
[00:52:07.840 --> 00:52:12.840]   pulling back in, but some of those fine details are changing just a little bit and are getting
[00:52:12.840 --> 00:52:16.840]   it out, which gives it kind of a more very smooth texture.
[00:52:16.840 --> 00:52:19.840]   They're grabbing the major things, but not grabbing the smaller things because then you
[00:52:19.840 --> 00:52:21.840]   get all kinds of weird ratta.
[00:52:21.840 --> 00:52:25.840]   But I think that that might be part of the process just based on the stuff we used to do.
[00:52:25.840 --> 00:52:31.840]   Yeah, it's hard to, it's important for everybody to understand that there's sharpness and then
[00:52:31.840 --> 00:52:36.840]   there's perceived sharpness and that's what this blog post is a really good job of explaining.
[00:52:36.840 --> 00:52:40.840]   The number of times I've been disappointed with a camera I've just bought,
[00:52:40.840 --> 00:52:44.840]   because one of the reasons why I bought it was because I went on Flickr and looked for
[00:52:44.840 --> 00:52:48.840]   other pictures taken with this camera and why are the pictures I'm getting not that sharp?
[00:52:48.840 --> 00:52:53.840]   Well, because you went into Photoshop or you even went into the Photos app and just simply
[00:52:53.840 --> 00:52:56.840]   slid something to the left to say, please make this look sharper.
[00:52:56.840 --> 00:52:58.840]   It really is about localized contrast.
[00:52:58.840 --> 00:53:01.840]   It's not about sharpness, it's about how much you notice the sharpness.
[00:53:01.840 --> 00:53:05.840]   That said, it really is a hugely valuable blog post.
[00:53:05.840 --> 00:53:12.840]   It's explaining a lot, not just about the excess, but about how the eye perceives sharpness,
[00:53:12.840 --> 00:53:18.840]   how the eye perceives detail and how pretty much every camera tries to make a pleasant picture.
[00:53:18.840 --> 00:53:22.840]   All that said, it's a binary reaction.
[00:53:22.840 --> 00:53:26.840]   Either you think a photo looks good or it doesn't and it doesn't matter whether it came out of
[00:53:26.840 --> 00:53:33.840]   a $5,000 camera with a $3,000 lens with $10,000 with a lighting or it came out of a phone camera.
[00:53:33.840 --> 00:53:38.840]   If people are consistently saying that I don't like how faces look in this camera,
[00:53:38.840 --> 00:53:40.840]   Apple is going to address that.
[00:53:40.840 --> 00:53:46.840]   It is deeply integrated in the pipeline, as when they said, but they can still put something
[00:53:46.840 --> 00:53:53.840]   downstream because remember that every JPEG is like the prints that old people above the age of 28
[00:53:53.840 --> 00:53:55.840]   used to pick up from the drugstore.
[00:53:55.840 --> 00:54:02.840]   The negative is the data that comes off the chip and the JPEG is just simply the decision made
[00:54:02.840 --> 00:54:05.840]   by the image processor about what that should look like.
[00:54:05.840 --> 00:54:06.840]   It'll be okay.
[00:54:06.840 --> 00:54:13.840]   One thing that I was really excited about the silly details of the way that the excess takes
[00:54:13.840 --> 00:54:19.840]   pictures is that now because they're trying to burst so many frames into one combined image,
[00:54:19.840 --> 00:54:22.840]   they're using a higher shutter speed.
[00:54:22.840 --> 00:54:24.840]   It's a faster shutter speed.
[00:54:24.840 --> 00:54:30.840]   One of the problems consistently of the iPhone, to my point of view, has been that Apple has
[00:54:30.840 --> 00:54:36.840]   been concerned about introducing image noise, which is what happens when you put more power
[00:54:36.840 --> 00:54:38.840]   through the chip and you make it more light sensitive.
[00:54:38.840 --> 00:54:43.840]   The problem is that when you have something that's in motion of any kind, that's the difference
[00:54:43.840 --> 00:54:49.840]   between a super, super sharp picture of a squirrel, which is what I'm getting.
[00:54:49.840 --> 00:54:56.840]   I usually get out of a Google phone or a Samsung phone and one that's fine for Instagram,
[00:54:56.840 --> 00:55:02.840]   but you can see if you look closely that the eyes are not quite as sharp as it could be.
[00:55:02.840 --> 00:55:03.840]   I have no kids.
[00:55:03.840 --> 00:55:07.840]   I also don't own a small yappy dog, so that's why I take pictures of squirrels.
[00:55:07.840 --> 00:55:11.840]   But if you have a small yappy dog, you realize that that's going to be something very, very
[00:55:11.840 --> 00:55:12.840]   important.
[00:55:12.840 --> 00:55:17.840]   There's something that's really interesting to me is that everyone will admit that this is
[00:55:17.840 --> 00:55:18.840]   subjective.
[00:55:18.840 --> 00:55:21.840]   There is absolutely an element of science to this, but there's absolutely an element of
[00:55:21.840 --> 00:55:22.840]   art to it.
[00:55:22.840 --> 00:55:25.840]   And Panzino in his tweet said that he would much rather have this detail and then to exactly
[00:55:25.840 --> 00:55:29.840]   what Andy said, he can slide that sharpness slider as much as he wants, but he can't recover
[00:55:29.840 --> 00:55:33.840]   any detail that's lost by pre-sharpening the image before they give it to him where Niele
[00:55:33.840 --> 00:55:37.840]   Patel from the Verge had a delightful tweet where he's like, "I will admit that all the details
[00:55:37.840 --> 00:55:41.840]   in there, but your eye can't see it is among the most delightful existential ways to evaluate
[00:55:41.840 --> 00:55:43.840]   a camera's quality I've ever heard in some time."
[00:55:43.840 --> 00:55:47.840]   So you have people who spend all their days with these cameras arguing about it.
[00:55:47.840 --> 00:55:50.840]   So you're allowed not to like it and you're allowed to complain bitterly if you wanted
[00:55:50.840 --> 00:55:51.840]   to change.
[00:55:51.840 --> 00:55:54.840]   I encourage you, because I'm not a fan of what the selfies look like, so I encourage
[00:55:54.840 --> 00:55:55.840]   you to please complain.
[00:55:55.840 --> 00:55:59.840]   And does it only with the phone software that it does this?
[00:55:59.840 --> 00:56:02.840]   So you could theoretically just use another app, right?
[00:56:02.840 --> 00:56:06.840]   Yeah, so the raw that's coming off of there is, and this is a whole other thing, the raw
[00:56:06.840 --> 00:56:09.840]   that's coming off of there is now purpose built for the AI and the ML.
[00:56:09.840 --> 00:56:13.840]   So if you just use any raw app, you might get results that are hard to work with.
[00:56:13.840 --> 00:56:18.840]   Halide created their own raw pipeline to sort of give you their version of a smart raw
[00:56:18.840 --> 00:56:20.840]   that's very different than Apple's.
[00:56:20.840 --> 00:56:25.000]   You'd have to find an app that does raw but also knows how to handle the kind of raw data
[00:56:25.000 --> 00:56:28.840]   Apple's pulling off of a computational photography system now.
[00:56:28.840 --> 00:56:34.840]   Here's in his post he shows on the left iPhone X raw, which actually looks pretty acceptable,
[00:56:34.840 --> 00:56:39.840]   and the iPhone X S raw, which is overblown, is over exposed.
[00:56:39.840 --> 00:56:48.840]   In fact, if you look in the details, the iPhone X exposed at 160th at ISO 40, the XS 120th
[00:56:48.840 --> 00:56:49.840]   at ISO 80.
[00:56:49.840 --> 00:56:51.840]   So he won one 20th.
[00:56:51.840 --> 00:56:58.840]   So, you know, he says basically this is very bad for, he says we make a camera app that
[00:56:58.840 --> 00:56:59.840]   takes raw photos.
[00:56:59.840 --> 00:57:04.840]   So this is very bad not only does raw not benefit from merging multiple photos, but iPhone
[00:57:04.840 --> 00:57:07.840]   photos generally get very noisy above ISO 200.
[00:57:07.840 --> 00:57:11.840]   In the right hand image, the highlights are clipped, so you can't recover them.
[00:57:11.840 --> 00:57:14.840]   It's over exposed and it's permanently over exposed.
[00:57:14.840 --> 00:57:18.840]   So that's why they've created basically, as you said, a new pipeline.
[00:57:18.840 --> 00:57:19.840]   Smart raw.
[00:57:19.840 --> 00:57:22.840]   Specifically for a halide.
[00:57:22.840 --> 00:57:24.840]   So when should you use this though?
[00:57:24.840 --> 00:57:27.840]   That's the question.
[00:57:27.840 --> 00:57:32.840]   I would say that the halide app is amazing.
[00:57:32.840 --> 00:57:33.840]   I love it.
[00:57:33.840 --> 00:57:37.840]   It's one of the reasons why I would love to switch back to iPhone at some point, because
[00:57:37.840 --> 00:57:38.840]   I can't get that.
[00:57:38.840 --> 00:57:43.840]   I would love for them to make it for my, I don't care about all the hundreds of different Android
[00:57:43.840 --> 00:57:45.840]   phones out there, just make it for the phone that I choose to buy.
[00:57:45.840 --> 00:57:47.840]   I'll give you my $10.
[00:57:47.840 --> 00:57:51.840]   You'll make a profit off of that.
[00:57:51.840 --> 00:57:58.240]   I do think that Apple's stock camera app is perfect for what a smartphone camera is supposed
[00:57:58.240 --> 00:57:59.240]   to do.
[00:57:59.240 --> 00:58:01.640]   People are not interested in fine art photography.
[00:58:01.640 --> 00:58:05.140]   They're really, although you can do fine art photography under certain service dances,
[00:58:05.140 --> 00:58:09.440]   it really is designed to push one button, get the best results possible.
[00:58:09.440 --> 00:58:13.880]   Whatever results you come up with are probably going to be way better than the user is hoping
[00:58:13.880 --> 00:58:14.880]   for.
[00:58:14.880 --> 00:58:20.000]   As engineers and as artists at Apple, they want to make the best picture possible.
[00:58:20.000 --> 00:58:24.640]   But this is the reason why I stopped doing side by side by side by side, like published
[00:58:24.640 --> 00:58:29.880]   comparisons years ago, because I do think they're, at this point, they're totally counterproductive.
[00:58:29.880 --> 00:58:36.280]   They will teach you that they will get you to try to trust a test result instead of your
[00:58:36.280 --> 00:58:37.440]   own eyes.
[00:58:37.440 --> 00:58:41.360]   The fact that one picture is a little bit too warm to your eyes compared to this other
[00:58:41.360 --> 00:58:42.360]   picture.
[00:58:42.360 --> 00:58:45.640]   It's okay, but that doesn't mean that that's something that A you would have noticed if
[00:58:45.640 --> 00:58:48.040]   you didn't have the side by side comparison.
[00:58:48.040 --> 00:58:51.640]   It's not as though you're going to take every single picture and think, "Oh my God, this
[00:58:51.640 --> 00:58:53.400]   camera is always taking yellow photos.
[00:58:53.400 --> 00:58:56.160]   I can't stand it."
[00:58:56.160 --> 00:58:59.480]   It's interesting for people who are paid to comment about this.
[00:58:59.480 --> 00:59:03.760]   Super interesting to read stuff from experts who absolutely know their stuff and they're
[00:59:03.760 --> 00:59:08.320]   not simply saying, "Well, I took these three pictures with these three cameras and I noticed
[00:59:08.320 --> 00:59:10.280]   that the skin is a lot smoother in this one."
[00:59:10.280 --> 00:59:14.840]   The question is, did you not like the picture that the iPhone took?
[00:59:14.840 --> 00:59:18.920]   Having seen enough of these examples, I don't have a new iPhone yet, but having seen enough
[00:59:18.920 --> 00:59:22.840]   of these examples, I would like to see Apple fine-tune that a bit.
[00:59:22.840 --> 00:59:27.800]   I expect that they're going to, but it doesn't take anything less than fantastic pictures.
[00:59:27.800 --> 00:59:28.800]   It's not exactly-
[00:59:28.800 --> 00:59:32.320]   I might argue with you on that.
[00:59:32.320 --> 00:59:34.280]   In certain conditions, it doesn't.
[00:59:34.280 --> 00:59:39.880]   Apple's goal is completely reasonably to let average people get great pictures without
[00:59:39.880 --> 00:59:41.400]   thinking about it.
[00:59:41.400 --> 00:59:42.920]   Here's a good example.
[00:59:42.920 --> 00:59:46.560]   On the right is iPhone's smart HDR and you can see the smoothing that's happened to the
[00:59:46.560 --> 00:59:50.240]   singer's face as completely obliterated detail.
[00:59:50.240 --> 00:59:52.120]   It looks like a watercolor.
[00:59:52.120 --> 00:59:56.760]   Halide's smart HDR does preserve the detail in the singer's face.
[00:59:56.760 --> 01:00:02.200]   In low light situations, for instance, there are some problems.
[01:00:02.200 --> 01:00:09.840]   He points out, you can turn off, which I didn't know, Apple's HDR.
[01:00:09.840 --> 01:00:15.640]   It's non-obvious, but you go to Settings, Camera, Disable, Smart HDR, and then when you open
[01:00:15.640 --> 01:00:19.200]   the Camera app, you'll have an HDR setting in the top controls.
[01:00:19.200 --> 01:00:23.160]   That gives you a chance to turn it off or on when you want it.
[01:00:23.160 --> 01:00:24.800]   There are times you may not want it.
[01:00:24.800 --> 01:00:25.800]   You should also-
[01:00:25.800 --> 01:00:26.840]   Well, I don't know how to do smart HDR.
[01:00:26.840 --> 01:00:27.840]   That might be the-
[01:00:27.840 --> 01:00:28.840]   That's just the old HDR.
[01:00:28.840 --> 01:00:29.840]   I have to double-check that.
[01:00:29.840 --> 01:00:30.840]   Yeah.
[01:00:30.840 --> 01:00:36.680]   There are definitely some issues and Halide isn't the perfect solution for it either.
[01:00:36.680 --> 01:00:44.200]   So it would be nice if Apple- what would be really nice is if Apple did a JPEG or a high
[01:00:44.200 --> 01:00:50.360]   efficiency image format image that was using all the smarts, maybe over smoothing, maybe
[01:00:50.360 --> 01:00:54.560]   not, and then gave you a switch that said, "Okay, or you could just have the raw."
[01:00:54.560 --> 01:00:56.760]   You can turn on and keep both images.
[01:00:56.760 --> 01:01:00.320]   You'll get the regular image and the HDR saved to your camera.
[01:01:00.320 --> 01:01:05.080]   The problem is you're getting this Apple Smart Raw, which is a little less than-
[01:01:05.080 --> 01:01:06.080]   Yeah.
[01:01:06.080 --> 01:01:14.440]   Again, you're talking to a nerd who owns way more cameras than he actually needs.
[01:01:14.440 --> 01:01:19.960]   And even I'm saying that I think that the better job you do of hiding things like raw
[01:01:19.960 --> 01:01:26.760]   features from the user, given what one of these 100 million iPhone users are using it
[01:01:26.760 --> 01:01:29.280]   for, the less confusion you're going to create.
[01:01:29.280 --> 01:01:34.040]   I love the idea of putting- I'm not always a fan of Apple collecting every application
[01:01:34.040 --> 01:01:37.320]   preference inside this extra app called Settings.
[01:01:37.320 --> 01:01:43.560]   But I like these solutions that say, "If you are interested enough in having raw quality,
[01:01:43.560 --> 01:01:47.920]   you will have done the Google search or you will have read the iBooks manual will be
[01:01:47.920 --> 01:01:54.400]   created for you and you will know to look into this settings pane and turn on raw capture."
[01:01:54.400 --> 01:01:55.400]   Or-
[01:01:55.400 --> 01:02:01.440]   And I commend Apple for doing this, make it possible for third party apps like Halide.
[01:02:01.440 --> 01:02:02.440]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:02:02.440 --> 01:02:05.440]   Completely bypass the processing and do their own thing.
[01:02:05.440 --> 01:02:08.440]   And I think that's that may be the best of both worlds.
[01:02:08.440 --> 01:02:14.480]   That's an under-understood part of development.
[01:02:14.480 --> 01:02:20.080]   Apple, oftentimes, people who've been developing for Apple for a long, long, long, long time
[01:02:20.080 --> 01:02:25.360]   develop really, really good relationships with engineers inside of Apple.
[01:02:25.360 --> 01:02:32.480]   And so it's possible for them to get not a non-competitive help.
[01:02:32.480 --> 01:02:36.360]   But if they say, "Here's what we're trying to do and we can't figure out how to do it,"
[01:02:36.360 --> 01:02:41.600]   they will often get solutions from Apple that are not necessarily available in the book
[01:02:41.600 --> 01:02:45.640]   that you download from Amazon.com about programming.
[01:02:45.640 --> 01:02:49.200]   So these are the people that know how to push this stuff to its highest limits.
[01:02:49.200 --> 01:02:52.400]   These are the people who can develop a raw pipeline.
[01:02:52.400 --> 01:02:57.400]   And Apple does this because I do think that philosophically they know that inside Apple
[01:02:57.400 --> 01:03:02.240]   they're developing for the regular consumer and they are grateful to third party developers,
[01:03:02.240 --> 01:03:05.640]   like the developers of Halide, who are going to say, "We're going to let you create the
[01:03:05.640 --> 01:03:13.080]   pro-level thing because we know that it's easier to make 100 million consumers happy
[01:03:13.080 --> 01:03:20.480]   with a camera app than to make 100 pro or semi-pro photographers happy with how something works."
[01:03:20.480 --> 01:03:22.920]   So I think that Apple's helping behind the scenes.
[01:03:22.920 --> 01:03:26.680]   I still think that Apple, I mean, I've said this before, but I think Apple focuses almost
[01:03:26.680 --> 01:03:30.840]   all their efforts on what will 90% of the people want to do 90% of the time.
[01:03:30.840 --> 01:03:34.040]   And if you're developing an app, I always think you should.
[01:03:34.040 --> 01:03:39.920]   What we did when we were developing apps for the Mac platform was to look at that 10/10.
[01:03:39.920 --> 01:03:42.760]   You know, like, what do 10% of people want to do 10% of the time?
[01:03:42.760 --> 01:03:45.320]   You know, or what, or 10% people want to do 100% of the time.
[01:03:45.320 --> 01:03:49.920]   But whatever, we want to live in that little world is the place that you can safely solve
[01:03:49.920 --> 01:03:54.800]   things for a while, and you know that Apple's probably not going to encroach on that.
[01:03:54.800 --> 01:03:59.160]   And those are the people also that are willing to pay for something that is different.
[01:03:59.160 --> 01:04:06.320]   If you care about all of this, go to blog.halide.com and read Sebastian Dewitt's very, very good,
[01:04:06.320 --> 01:04:08.920]   I think, with lots of examples article.
[01:04:08.920 --> 01:04:09.920]   It's great.
[01:04:09.920 --> 01:04:14.960]   His general conclusion is it's still a great camera, but you need to be aware of what it's
[01:04:14.960 --> 01:04:20.120]   doing, and in some cases, especially if you're a serious photographer, there may be, here's
[01:04:20.120 --> 01:04:27.040]   a good example that Apple provided of how it's smooth in low light compared to daylight.
[01:04:27.040 --> 01:04:29.960]   And that's, you know, Apple said that this is what it did.
[01:04:29.960 --> 01:04:32.520]   These were images it used in its product.
[01:04:32.520 --> 01:04:35.560]   And that's the front sensor, which is much smaller in low light.
[01:04:35.560 --> 01:04:36.560]   Yeah.
[01:04:36.560 --> 01:04:41.080]   And that concert, that concert side by side picture, either one of those is miraculous
[01:04:41.080 --> 01:04:42.160]   on a camera.
[01:04:42.160 --> 01:04:45.760]   It's only recently that you wouldn't even, you would look at people who are taking pictures
[01:04:45.760 --> 01:04:49.040]   of concerts saying, oh, you're an idiot, you're not going to get a good picture.
[01:04:49.040 --> 01:04:53.000]   And now you're getting pictures that are at least good and oftentimes great.
[01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:57.480]   And before anybody's ever used a camera phone will recognize this crunched image.
[01:04:57.480 --> 01:05:00.880]   I mean, that I don't try to call that a great image.
[01:05:00.880 --> 01:05:02.680]   Well, I'm saying this is pretty good.
[01:05:02.680 --> 01:05:05.320]   The light is a different processing.
[01:05:05.320 --> 01:05:06.320]   Exactly.
[01:05:06.320 --> 01:05:10.560]   But the light is not, the light is not the strongly honored, she's not hit by a spotlight.
[01:05:10.560 --> 01:05:14.080]   It's super, super low light and at least give you a picture that you can help, you can share
[01:05:14.080 --> 01:05:17.120]   with your friends, say, hey, look how close I was to the stage.
[01:05:17.120 --> 01:05:18.120]   Right.
[01:05:18.120 --> 01:05:22.800]   And let me, but just to, just to give you an indication of how good these cameras are,
[01:05:22.800 --> 01:05:32.840]   this year I did my, one of my goals for this year was to have my photography derided by
[01:05:32.840 --> 01:05:37.080]   a group of people with higher knowledge of what constitutes good photography.
[01:05:37.080 --> 01:05:41.040]   So I decided, I'm going to start, like, I'm going to enter at least one juried, or juried
[01:05:41.040 --> 01:05:42.040]   photo.
[01:05:42.040 --> 01:05:46.600]   I just, I submitted, I submitted three and the one that they accepted that's going to
[01:05:46.600 --> 01:05:51.960]   be on the walls in a couple of weeks with shot with an iPhone 10 last year.
[01:05:51.960 --> 01:05:52.960]   Wow.
[01:05:52.960 --> 01:05:53.800]   And it looks magnificent.
[01:05:53.800 --> 01:05:58.680]   You would not, granted, it's not that every picture you take with an iPhone 10 is beautiful,
[01:05:58.680 --> 01:06:05.520]   but last, last week I went to a really good, like professional print studio and produced
[01:06:05.520 --> 01:06:07.880]   an 11 by 17 and a 16 by 20.
[01:06:07.880 --> 01:06:09.400]   And both of them look magnificent.
[01:06:09.400 --> 01:06:11.080]   You would not guess.
[01:06:11.080 --> 01:06:16.320]   I had, there were some crimes, but there were some crimes from the fact that those were
[01:06:16.320 --> 01:06:20.840]   shot with a standard camera app and saved as a JPEG, but easily concealed.
[01:06:20.840 --> 01:06:25.360]   But there's so much detail, so much tonality that even blown up to that huge size.
[01:06:25.360 --> 01:06:26.840]   It looks magnificent.
[01:06:26.840 --> 01:06:33.680]   So really, Apple always has so much to be proud of because they were always at the head of
[01:06:33.680 --> 01:06:38.320]   the line for people who were saying, it's, I know the people are just posting things
[01:06:38.320 --> 01:06:43.120]   on Facebook and Instagram, but some, these pictures are going to wind up are going to
[01:06:43.120 --> 01:06:49.120]   be like the last picture you ever got of your grandmother before she, unfortunately, I expected
[01:06:49.120 --> 01:06:50.200]   to be dropped dead.
[01:06:50.200 --> 01:06:53.120]   And that's going to be the picture that you, someone's going to print at eight by 10 and
[01:06:53.120 --> 01:06:54.960]   put on the sofa table.
[01:06:54.960 --> 01:06:58.400]   So it's like, there's anything they can do to make that one button push as effective
[01:06:58.400 --> 01:06:59.400]   as possible.
[01:06:59.400 --> 01:07:02.000]   We're going to do, they have lots to be proud of.
[01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:08.160]   And as Sebastian points out, Apple, since it's all software, Apple can over time modify this
[01:07:08.160 --> 01:07:09.160]   to a kit.
[01:07:09.160 --> 01:07:17.240]   We're moving into such a crazy place when it comes to cameras where the physical element
[01:07:17.240 --> 01:07:19.840]   is becoming completely separated from the calculation.
[01:07:19.840 --> 01:07:23.200]   I mean, we've been doing this for a while when we talk about a CMOS sensor or even a
[01:07:23.200 --> 01:07:28.080]   CC, the CMOS sensor, everything is all, all the little RGBs are all next to each other.
[01:07:28.080 --> 01:07:31.600]   So there's a lot going on when you see an image, you know, to even have it look sharp
[01:07:31.600 --> 01:07:33.920]   because it's all blurry.
[01:07:33.920 --> 01:07:37.280]   And so, but we've now moved, you know, we're just going to keep on moving, I think, down
[01:07:37.280 --> 01:07:40.240]   this path where there's so much of its computational.
[01:07:40.240 --> 01:07:43.600]   And I still, I say this, I think every time we talk about cameras, but the funnest thing
[01:07:43.600 --> 01:07:48.840]   to look at for me is to play with things with BOCOS, you know, on the phone.
[01:07:48.840 --> 01:07:52.720]   You take your portrait photos and then you open it up and you rotate around to see how
[01:07:52.720 --> 01:07:57.120]   it viewed the 3D space and are able to really kind of dig into those things.
[01:07:57.120 --> 01:08:02.640]   And it really gives you a place to experiment with the idea of computational photography.
[01:08:02.640 --> 01:08:05.120]   Remind me, I have to re-download FOCOS.
[01:08:05.120 --> 01:08:06.120]   Yeah, phone.
[01:08:06.120 --> 01:08:07.680]   Yeah, that's great.
[01:08:07.680 --> 01:08:10.800]   Our show today brought to you by ITProTV.
[01:08:10.800 --> 01:08:16.080]   You know, a study just came out from MIT and that doesn't surprise me, but it probably
[01:08:16.080 --> 01:08:20.080]   won't surprise you, but it does confirm what everybody I think thought.
[01:08:20.080 --> 01:08:29.520]   IT occupations have grown by almost 20% in the last, say, 10 years between 2004 and 2017.
[01:08:29.520 --> 01:08:34.320]   IT jobs are out there, lots of them, and they're great jobs.
[01:08:34.320 --> 01:08:39.560]   While the earning growth for college graduates has flattened since 2000, earnings for individuals
[01:08:39.560 --> 01:08:42.840]   working in IT, significant growth.
[01:08:42.840 --> 01:08:47.160]   Now's the time to take a look at a new career in IT or move up the ladder by getting some
[01:08:47.160 --> 01:08:49.520]   skills, additional skills.
[01:08:49.520 --> 01:08:55.360]   ITProTV as you covered, either way, from CompTIA and Cisco to EC Council to VMware.
[01:08:55.360 --> 01:08:58.040]   They've got all the certs everybody wants.
[01:08:58.040 --> 01:09:03.320]   You can study in over 4,000 hours of binge-worthy on-demand training.
[01:09:03.320 --> 01:09:04.880]   Great hosts too.
[01:09:04.880 --> 01:09:07.000]   They do it kind of like we do in a talk show format.
[01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:08.320]   They have a chat room.
[01:09:08.320 --> 01:09:10.360]   If you're watching live, they're live every day.
[01:09:10.360 --> 01:09:13.000]   Content goes studio to web in 24 hours.
[01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:15.480]   So it's always fresh, always up to date.
[01:09:15.480 --> 01:09:21.920]   They're always adding new content areas, which makes it a little interesting to find.
[01:09:21.920 --> 01:09:24.040]   That's why they've really improved the search.
[01:09:24.040 --> 01:09:31.120]   They've got all the courses listed by category, certification, job role, Stream IT Pro's TVs,
[01:09:31.120 --> 01:09:37.600]   courses live in on-demand worldwide via Chromecast, Roku, Amazon Fire TV, Apple TV, PC.
[01:09:37.600 --> 01:09:39.360]   Of course, they have iOS and Android apps.
[01:09:39.360 --> 01:09:43.760]   That all makes it very easy to watch at home on the big screen in the car as you drive
[01:09:43.760 --> 01:09:45.680]   in at work on your computer.
[01:09:45.680 --> 01:09:48.920]   If you manage a team, man, you've got to look at IT Pro TV.
[01:09:48.920 --> 01:09:52.120]   It's a great way to keep your teams skills up to date.
[01:09:52.120 --> 01:09:53.120]   Look at that.
[01:09:53.120 --> 01:09:54.120]   They're over 100.
[01:09:54.120 --> 01:09:57.520]   They just went over 100,000 members as we were watching.
[01:09:57.520 --> 01:09:58.920]   That's kind of amazing.
[01:09:58.920 --> 01:09:59.920]   Congratulations.

[01:11:14.080 --> 01:11:15.560]   Yes, sir.
[01:11:15.560 --> 01:11:17.720]   It's emoji time.
[01:11:17.720 --> 01:11:28.280]   Seventy new emojis coming to iOS 12.1, including hair options, sports items and animals.
[01:11:28.280 --> 01:11:29.280]   And Montreal bagels.
[01:11:29.280 --> 01:11:30.360]   I'm claiming them as Montreal bagels.
[01:11:30.360 --> 01:11:32.600]   I think they look like Montreal bagels.
[01:11:32.600 --> 01:11:36.760]   By the way, I read an article by a New Yorker just the other day.
[01:11:36.760 --> 01:11:38.960]   It's that the last great bagels are still made in Montreal.
[01:11:38.960 --> 01:11:40.960]   They're not made in New York anymore.
[01:11:40.960 --> 01:11:41.960]   I know.
[01:11:41.960 --> 01:11:44.360]   People like Save Bars have ruined it.
[01:11:44.360 --> 01:11:49.080]   You know, it started when Cynthia Nixon is running for governor in the great state of
[01:11:49.080 --> 01:11:50.080]   New York.
[01:11:50.080 --> 01:11:58.360]   Got some controversy because your cinnamon raisin bagel with Gravelax.
[01:11:58.360 --> 01:12:00.360]   And people were up in arms.
[01:12:00.360 --> 01:12:02.200]   Gravelax a Pokemon?
[01:12:02.200 --> 01:12:04.200]   No, it is a delicious spread.
[01:12:04.200 --> 01:12:07.000]   However, there's rainbow bagels in some places too.
[01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:08.000]   It is a savory.
[01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:10.800]   It is a savory spread that shouldn't go on a sweet bagel.
[01:12:10.800 --> 01:12:14.200]   And I understand that point of view, but honestly.
[01:12:14.200 --> 01:12:15.920]   I mean, I don't know, savory sweet.
[01:12:15.920 --> 01:12:16.920]   It's for me.
[01:12:16.920 --> 01:12:19.360]   It's just like chocolate covered pretzels.
[01:12:19.360 --> 01:12:20.360]   I like that.
[01:12:20.360 --> 01:12:22.000]   It's like sold on your chocolate.
[01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:27.880]   Didn't this sort of stuff happen to Leslie Nopenh Park some recreation every single time
[01:12:27.880 --> 01:12:29.640]   she tried to run for anything?
[01:12:29.640 --> 01:12:34.240]   Well, it's that old thing that, you know, trying to look like you're a native when you're
[01:12:34.240 --> 01:12:35.240]   not.
[01:12:35.240 --> 01:12:37.120]   But in fact, Cynthia Nixon lives in Manhattan.
[01:12:37.120 --> 01:12:40.160]   So I think she can have her bagel any damn way she pleases.
[01:12:40.160 --> 01:12:41.440]   Thank you very much.
[01:12:41.440 --> 01:12:45.240]   And if you know, I'm going to, I got to go to Montreal because I want a real bagel.
[01:12:45.240 --> 01:12:47.480]   The last great bagel still made in Montreal.
[01:12:47.480 --> 01:12:48.480]   We'll go to Fairmount.
[01:12:48.480 --> 01:12:49.480]   We'll go to the best.
[01:12:49.480 --> 01:12:50.480]   The best.
[01:12:50.480 --> 01:12:52.360]   Peter and Fairmount are across the street from each other.
[01:12:52.360 --> 01:12:53.360]   Ancient rivals.
[01:12:53.360 --> 01:12:54.360]   I like them both.
[01:12:54.360 --> 01:12:56.080]   It's controversial, but I like them both.
[01:12:56.080 --> 01:12:57.080]   Yeah.
[01:12:57.080 --> 01:13:00.320]   Just to, you know, New York bagels used to have, they were denser.
[01:13:00.320 --> 01:13:03.880]   They were like lead weights, frankly.
[01:13:03.880 --> 01:13:05.080]   You can use them to fish.
[01:13:05.080 --> 01:13:06.080]   Yep.
[01:13:06.080 --> 01:13:10.600]   And now they're all fluffy and puffy and, you know, I mean, I just kind of know as bagel
[01:13:10.600 --> 01:13:11.600]   thing.
[01:13:11.600 --> 01:13:14.680]   It's round bread and the hole has gotten smaller and smaller.
[01:13:14.680 --> 01:13:16.080]   It's just not the same.
[01:13:16.080 --> 01:13:18.240]   No, they still make them the old fashioned way in Montreal.
[01:13:18.240 --> 01:13:23.680]   We still got holes that'll drop you filling right on the floor.
[01:13:23.680 --> 01:13:28.440]   Here comes a kangaroo, a lobster, a cupcake, and a mango.
[01:13:28.440 --> 01:13:29.440]   That is a, what is that?
[01:13:29.440 --> 01:13:30.440]   Is that a hornet?
[01:13:30.440 --> 01:13:31.440]   That's scary.
[01:13:31.440 --> 01:13:32.440]   I don't want to watch.
[01:13:32.440 --> 01:13:33.440]   I think.
[01:13:33.440 --> 01:13:34.440]   Oh, is it a skater?
[01:13:34.440 --> 01:13:36.320]   Why did they add that?
[01:13:36.320 --> 01:13:37.320]   And a raccoon.
[01:13:37.320 --> 01:13:38.320]   Yeah.
[01:13:38.320 --> 01:13:39.320]   Okay.
[01:13:39.320 --> 01:13:40.320]   Look across.
[01:13:40.320 --> 01:13:41.320]   I can get behind Frisbee.
[01:13:41.320 --> 01:13:42.320]   I can get behind Frisbee.
[01:13:42.320 --> 01:13:43.320]   I can get behind.
[01:13:43.320 --> 01:13:44.320]   And still no put in.
[01:13:44.320 --> 01:13:46.800]   I mean, like you should be able to hold down on the French fries and get put in tater
[01:13:46.800 --> 01:13:48.800]   tots and mashed potato options.
[01:13:48.800 --> 01:13:51.040]   And they just, Unicode is failing me.
[01:13:51.040 --> 01:13:52.040]   Failing us.
[01:13:52.040 --> 01:13:53.040]   Yeah.
[01:13:53.040 --> 01:13:56.600]   I have the public beta of 12.1 on my iPad.
[01:13:56.600 --> 01:13:58.920]   Are you saying I should have those emojis?
[01:13:58.920 --> 01:13:59.920]   You should.
[01:13:59.920 --> 01:14:03.920]   I think the poutine is being blocked by the American Medical Association is.
[01:14:03.920 --> 01:14:04.920]   I bet.
[01:14:04.920 --> 01:14:08.880]   The heart, heart, heart, heart, heart surges around the world or maybe they're actually
[01:14:08.880 --> 01:14:10.760]   promoting it so they get more work.
[01:14:10.760 --> 01:14:12.320]   According to how I see it, I feel like I'm.
[01:14:12.320 --> 01:14:17.000]   The less feed apple has also proposed and will have next year 13 new emojis for those
[01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:18.000]   disabilities.
[01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:19.000]   Yeah.
[01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:20.000]   I love that.
[01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:21.000]   Yeah.
[01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:22.000]   Thank you, apple.
[01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:23.000]   That's awesome.
[01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:28.160]   Emojis of guide and service dogs, people with canes, individuals signing the word deaf
[01:14:28.160 --> 01:14:32.680]   and ear with a hearing aid, people in wheelchairs and prosthetic limbs.
[01:14:32.680 --> 01:14:33.680]   I love that.
[01:14:33.680 --> 01:14:34.680]   That's fantastic.
[01:14:34.680 --> 01:14:38.680]   I'll be using that hearing aid emoji a lot.
[01:14:38.680 --> 01:14:40.400]   I just want to say.
[01:14:40.400 --> 01:14:46.720]   I'm going to add one for like miniature pony service animals because the Americans with
[01:14:46.720 --> 01:14:52.080]   disabilities act only acknowledges to animals that can be trained for as service animals.
[01:14:52.080 --> 01:14:54.480]   And believe it or not, the miniature horse is the other one.
[01:14:54.480 --> 01:14:55.480]   What?
[01:14:55.480 --> 01:14:58.200]   I want to miss your horse on the plane with me next time.
[01:14:58.200 --> 01:14:59.200]   Now I'm so excited.
[01:14:59.200 --> 01:15:00.200]   Like that would be awesome.
[01:15:00.200 --> 01:15:02.080]   I'll ride it through the aisles.
[01:15:02.080 --> 01:15:06.080]   I still am thinking of the emotional support him on a barrico.
[01:15:06.080 --> 01:15:07.280]   I'm really working on that.
[01:15:07.280 --> 01:15:08.280]   Yes.
[01:15:08.280 --> 01:15:09.280]   Little thing.
[01:15:09.280 --> 01:15:10.280]   I'm so jealous.
[01:15:10.280 --> 01:15:11.280]   I was so jealous.
[01:15:11.280 --> 01:15:13.480]   I went to the casino and got some Jamon Barric.
[01:15:13.480 --> 01:15:14.880]   I just like jealous.
[01:15:14.880 --> 01:15:22.040]   As a freelancer, I'm still trying to figure out whether I can get me a little bit.
[01:15:22.040 --> 01:15:27.240]   More clicks before these new emojis come out and say, Apple should once again, you've
[01:15:27.240 --> 01:15:28.560]   got a lobster emoji.
[01:15:28.560 --> 01:15:30.600]   It's a red lobster, which means it's been cooked.
[01:15:30.600 --> 01:15:33.560]   You want it to be like brownish green, which means it's still alive.
[01:15:33.560 --> 01:15:37.440]   Given that there's people who are saying, you need to anesthetize the you can't boil
[01:15:37.440 --> 01:15:39.120]   these these animals alive anymore.
[01:15:39.120 --> 01:15:40.120]   It's cruel.
[01:15:40.120 --> 01:15:44.400]   I don't know whether I'll make more make more get more views with publishing that before
[01:15:44.400 --> 01:15:48.800]   or being the first one to have to ride about lobster gate like after these emojis come
[01:15:48.800 --> 01:15:49.800]   up.
[01:15:49.800 --> 01:15:50.800]   Lobster gate.
[01:15:50.800 --> 01:15:51.800]   Lobster gate.
[01:15:51.800 --> 01:15:56.920]   Most people want to see a lobster.
[01:15:56.920 --> 01:15:57.920]   You said you went to the casino.
[01:15:57.920 --> 01:16:00.200]   Did you go to Joelle Robert Shaw?
[01:16:00.200 --> 01:16:01.520]   I went to the Italian.
[01:16:01.520 --> 01:16:05.080]   You went to the Italian at the casino because I know they have a giant show.
[01:16:05.080 --> 01:16:06.080]   They do.
[01:16:06.080 --> 01:16:07.080]   I'm all in Barrica right at the counter.
[01:16:07.080 --> 01:16:08.080]   They do in Paris.
[01:16:08.080 --> 01:16:10.120]   They had one and I had some.
[01:16:10.120 --> 01:16:11.120]   Yeah.
[01:16:11.120 --> 01:16:12.120]   And they give you so much.
[01:16:12.120 --> 01:16:13.120]   It is so good.
[01:16:13.120 --> 01:16:14.120]   Well, they are there for that price.
[01:16:14.120 --> 01:16:15.120]   I know.
[01:16:15.120 --> 01:16:16.120]   Oh, man.
[01:16:16.120 --> 01:16:19.000]   Now I have two reasons to visit you.
[01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:20.000]   Yes.
[01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:21.000]   Bagels in the Italian.
[01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:22.000]   Oh, man.
[01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:24.000]   We'll do it Leo.
[01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:25.000]   Yeah.
[01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:26.640]   Lisa, can we go to Montreal?
[01:16:26.640 --> 01:16:29.800]   We could do the show for Montreal.
[01:16:29.800 --> 01:16:30.800]   Yes.
[01:16:30.800 --> 01:16:31.800]   Totally.
[01:16:31.800 --> 01:16:32.800]   Why don't we do that?
[01:16:32.800 --> 01:16:35.080]   Just don't try to leave late on late from the airport.
[01:16:35.080 --> 01:16:36.080]   Why?
[01:16:36.080 --> 01:16:38.240]   They stop flights at like 630 or 700 walk in.
[01:16:38.240 --> 01:16:39.240]   It's a civilized nation.
[01:16:39.240 --> 01:16:40.240]   I know.
[01:16:40.240 --> 01:16:42.880]   I was just like I had to get this run right to DC or something from Montreal and I was
[01:16:42.880 --> 01:16:43.880]   just like what?
[01:16:43.880 --> 01:16:46.280]   You just don't have a lot of flights Alex.
[01:16:46.280 --> 01:16:50.360]   It's not like it was like but it was like it was like my flight was being delayed or
[01:16:50.360 --> 01:16:53.160]   it was going to be canceled or something and then they were like all the flights are
[01:16:53.160 --> 01:16:54.160]   sorry.
[01:16:54.160 --> 01:16:56.480]   There's no flight after seven p.m. or something like that.
[01:16:56.480 --> 01:16:58.480]   I was stuck here.
[01:16:58.480 --> 01:17:00.600]   Why would you ever want to leave?
[01:17:00.600 --> 01:17:02.000]   Well, you must stay in my head.
[01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:04.000]   Bar stay open to three but not the airports.
[01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:05.000]   Yeah.
[01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:07.080]   Your prime minister is so handsome.
[01:17:07.080 --> 01:17:10.800]   When you ask him a question about quantum computing, he asks you which type I've only
[01:17:10.800 --> 01:17:11.800]   know.
[01:17:11.800 --> 01:17:15.880]   Hey, what's a good time of year to go to Montreal Renee?
[01:17:15.880 --> 01:17:17.360]   I mean, it really depends.
[01:17:17.360 --> 01:17:20.120]   So like it's really cold in the winter.
[01:17:20.120 --> 01:17:23.880]   You have like ice hotels but then in the spring and fall it's nice especially the fall because
[01:17:23.880 --> 01:17:25.400]   the leaves, you know, change color.
[01:17:25.400 --> 01:17:26.400]   It looks really nice.
[01:17:26.400 --> 01:17:29.600]   In the summer we have jazz festivals and comedy festivals but it's hot.
[01:17:29.600 --> 01:17:31.960]   So it really depends on what you like.
[01:17:31.960 --> 01:17:32.960]   Oh man.
[01:17:32.960 --> 01:17:35.040]   I think I've only been there in the fall and it's been amazing.
[01:17:35.040 --> 01:17:36.040]   Yeah.
[01:17:36.040 --> 01:17:40.600]   It's too soon for me to go on vacation again.
[01:17:40.600 --> 01:17:44.800]   Here's an amazing story.
[01:17:44.800 --> 01:17:53.800]   Apple Watch apps instantly wait 64 bit thanks to a little checkbox in Xcode called Enable
[01:17:53.800 --> 01:17:56.320]   Bitcode.
[01:17:56.320 --> 01:18:01.400]   According to the accidental tech podcast, it was quietly responsible for the smooth launch
[01:18:01.400 --> 01:18:04.720]   of software for the series for last month.
[01:18:04.720 --> 01:18:09.080]   So Xcode 7 back in 2015 added support for Bitcode.
[01:18:09.080 --> 01:18:11.840]   You're gonna have to explain this to me Renee.
[01:18:11.840 --> 01:18:14.280]   I presume you understand this.
[01:18:14.280 --> 01:18:17.640]   My favorite part of the story is that the headlines that obscure and then Chris Latener
[01:18:17.640 --> 01:18:20.000]   tweeted out who's calling it obscure.
[01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:21.000]   Bitcode.
[01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:23.560]   So Bitcode is like a pseudo code, right?
[01:18:23.560 --> 01:18:25.240]   It's not machine language.
[01:18:25.240 --> 01:18:26.240]   It's an intermediate.
[01:18:26.240 --> 01:18:27.240]   Yeah.
[01:18:27.240 --> 01:18:31.560]   So basically the developer uploads to Apple and then Apple creates Bitcode versions that
[01:18:31.560 --> 01:18:32.880]   are specific to the processor.
[01:18:32.880 --> 01:18:36.040]   So for example, if you get a new iPhone, you'll notice you have to re download your apps.
[01:18:36.040 --> 01:18:38.840]   They don't just transfer over because it's downloading the versions of the apps that
[01:18:38.840 --> 01:18:41.800]   are compiled for the processor that you're running on that.
[01:18:41.800 --> 01:18:43.800]   But the developer didn't do that.
[01:18:43.800 --> 01:18:45.240]   Apple does it automatically.
[01:18:45.240 --> 01:18:46.240]   Yeah.
[01:18:46.240 --> 01:18:48.640]   And people were saying early on that, oh, it's not really, it's just a pain in the butt
[01:18:48.640 --> 01:18:50.200]   and there's no real benefit to it.
[01:18:50.200 --> 01:18:53.720]   And then Apple bided at its time, you know, bode at its time, one of those conjugations
[01:18:53.720 --> 01:18:55.640]   and said here, 64 bit.
[01:18:55.640 --> 01:18:56.640]   Boom.
[01:18:56.640 --> 01:19:02.440]   So if you wrote an app for the Apple Watch and you checked that box enabling Bitcode,
[01:19:02.440 --> 01:19:05.160]   Apple didn't receive the fully compiled version of your app.
[01:19:05.160 --> 01:19:10.680]   It received a Bitcode version of your app, which it then trans compiles into different
[01:19:10.680 --> 01:19:14.120]   versions, depending on which series watch you're using.
[01:19:14.120 --> 01:19:15.120]   Yeah.
[01:19:15.120 --> 01:19:17.320]   And I believe it was mandatory for Apple Watch.
[01:19:17.320 --> 01:19:19.760]   I don't think I think it was optional for iPhone for a while.
[01:19:19.760 --> 01:19:22.600]   I think it was mandatory for Apple Watch if memory serves.
[01:19:22.600 --> 01:19:25.960]   And the idea was that Apple could make the idea was to sort of future proof it against
[01:19:25.960 --> 01:19:29.520]   future optimizations so that even though like so you would not have to go back and make
[01:19:29.520 --> 01:19:32.720]   changes to your apps, Apple could deliver some of those changes, especially at the lower
[01:19:32.720 --> 01:19:35.240]   processor levels for you at deployment.
[01:19:35.240 --> 01:19:40.200]   So the new Apple Watch has an S4 64 bit S4 processor in it.
[01:19:40.200 --> 01:19:44.480]   And the rumor has it that it's actually running iPhone efficiency cores, maybe like the Chinook
[01:19:44.480 --> 01:19:46.560]   class cores, which is a real big deal effect.
[01:19:46.560 --> 01:19:48.440]   It's out to be true.
[01:19:48.440 --> 01:19:51.720]   I have to say it is absolutely the case that everything is faster.
[01:19:51.720 --> 01:19:52.720]   Lapse launch faster.
[01:19:52.720 --> 01:19:57.520]   Everything is like it should be like in real time instead of way, way, way.
[01:19:57.520 --> 01:19:59.600]   And I just assumed that was a faster processor.
[01:19:59.600 --> 01:20:02.360]   But in fact, it's not merely a faster processor.
[01:20:02.360 --> 01:20:03.360]   It's 64 bit code.
[01:20:03.360 --> 01:20:07.320]   It's amazing that we went like the original Apple Watch ran at the thermal limits of that
[01:20:07.320 --> 01:20:08.320]   casing.
[01:20:08.320 --> 01:20:10.880]   And we went to this just to scan for versions later.
[01:20:10.880 --> 01:20:12.640]   It's really remarkable.
[01:20:12.640 --> 01:20:14.120]   I love this watch.
[01:20:14.120 --> 01:20:17.200]   Like I'm going to say is that I do too.
[01:20:17.200 --> 01:20:19.040]   And I was like, I was really skeptical.
[01:20:19.040 --> 01:20:21.080]   No, I was like, I've talked about it before in the show.
[01:20:21.080 --> 01:20:23.360]   I was like, ah, it solves enough problems that I buy it.
[01:20:23.360 --> 01:20:26.920]   You know, like I was like the first, the first, all the first four ones, you know, I was
[01:20:26.920 --> 01:20:28.200]   like, kind of like, ah, it's okay.
[01:20:28.200 --> 01:20:29.960]   You know, like I can, I like the timer.
[01:20:29.960 --> 01:20:31.760]   I stopped doing it right through series two.
[01:20:31.760 --> 01:20:35.400]   I was kind of like, I like the timer and there's enough things that I didn't, I didn't
[01:20:35.400 --> 01:20:38.000]   like it as much as my citizen, I have a, I had a NABBA Hawker.
[01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:40.680]   I still have one line around somewhere.
[01:20:40.680 --> 01:20:45.640]   But the, I was like, ah, I still don't like it as much as my other, my other watch.
[01:20:45.640 --> 01:20:47.140]   But it still has things I need.
[01:20:47.140 --> 01:20:48.480]   So I just keep wearing it.
[01:20:48.480 --> 01:20:51.840]   And I figured eventually Apple will figure this out and it'll be better because I, this
[01:20:51.840 --> 01:20:52.840]   is okay.
[01:20:52.840 --> 01:20:54.000]   It's still better than anything else I've had.
[01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:58.160]   I mean, as far from a service perspective, I have learned to turn almost all the notifications
[01:20:58.160 --> 01:20:59.360]   off because they drive me crazy.
[01:20:59.360 --> 01:21:00.640]   Oh, I turn them all on.
[01:21:00.640 --> 01:21:01.640]   I love it.
[01:21:01.640 --> 01:21:02.640]   I hate it.
[01:21:02.640 --> 01:21:03.640]   I want to know what's going on in the world.
[01:21:03.640 --> 01:21:05.320]   I love the new deliver quietly feature.
[01:21:05.320 --> 01:21:08.840]   So a lot of the notification I used to get, I just hit the deliver quietly and now I can
[01:21:08.840 --> 01:21:12.000]   go to the notification center and see them, but they're not going beep, beep, beep, beep
[01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:13.600]   on my devices all the time.
[01:21:13.600 --> 01:21:14.600]   Right.
[01:21:14.600 --> 01:21:15.600]   Yeah.
[01:21:15.600 --> 01:21:18.000]   I'm in a lot of meetings where there's people that demand like absolute attention.
[01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:23.160]   So it's, you know, you, you know, you're looking, even looking down as seen as like a cross.
[01:21:23.160 --> 01:21:24.160]   Well, that's what you don't see them.
[01:21:24.160 --> 01:21:26.600]   Like you don't see them until you go to a notification center and ask to see what you
[01:21:26.600 --> 01:21:27.600]   missed.
[01:21:27.600 --> 01:21:28.600]   Yeah.
[01:21:28.600 --> 01:21:29.600]   So I just, I don't, like I just like to stay focused.
[01:21:29.600 --> 01:21:31.400]   And so I, I, so I turned all those things off.
[01:21:31.400 --> 01:21:33.760]   But when I got this, I was like, I don't know if it'll be that much better, but I can't,
[01:21:33.760 --> 01:21:35.640]   you know, can't keep on doing the show without it on it.
[01:21:35.640 --> 01:21:39.520]   And I'm just like, I put, you know, of course I use the most complex, you know, the, yeah,
[01:21:39.520 --> 01:21:40.520]   I like to do it.
[01:21:40.520 --> 01:21:41.520]   You've got a new info graph.
[01:21:41.520 --> 01:21:45.640]   I've got it all, I've got it all lined up and I'm like, I really just, it's the best
[01:21:45.640 --> 01:21:46.640]   watch I've had now.
[01:21:46.640 --> 01:21:49.840]   Like it's finally gotten to that point where I'm like, okay, I really, I really like the
[01:21:49.840 --> 01:21:54.320]   watch because before it was just kind of like I was useful kind of, but it's great.
[01:21:54.320 --> 01:21:55.320]   Love it.
[01:21:55.320 --> 01:21:58.680]   Speaking of great, you bought an iPhone.
[01:21:58.680 --> 01:22:00.000]   Did you buy which one did you buy?
[01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:02.480]   I got the, the max.
[01:22:02.480 --> 01:22:03.480]   The max.
[01:22:03.480 --> 01:22:04.480]   Yes.
[01:22:04.480 --> 01:22:05.480]   Or yeah.
[01:22:05.480 --> 01:22:07.160]   And I, I shot a, I shot a video.
[01:22:07.160 --> 01:22:09.600]   You shot a video on Twitter, not with your new life.
[01:22:09.600 --> 01:22:10.600]   I don't do that right.
[01:22:10.600 --> 01:22:11.600]   No, I rolled it.
[01:22:11.600 --> 01:22:14.600]   So the X, I felt kind of guilty because I, you know, it was like, it's kind of like
[01:22:14.600 --> 01:22:18.440]   going out on a, I'm going to go on a date with someone else and then, and then, and then
[01:22:18.440 --> 01:22:20.840]   doing it with the, and then you got the video with the X.
[01:22:20.840 --> 01:22:21.840]   You got the video with the placement.
[01:22:21.840 --> 01:22:22.840]   You got the video with the placement.
[01:22:22.840 --> 01:22:23.840]   What?
[01:22:23.840 --> 01:22:24.840]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:22:24.840 --> 01:22:29.440]   This is what you're about to go for somebody else, you know, and so, so anyway, so yeah,
[01:22:29.440 --> 01:22:30.440]   I shot it with the X.
[01:22:30.440 --> 01:22:35.240]   But this was they, so evidently you can go into the Apple store and say, I'd like to
[01:22:35.240 --> 01:22:40.800]   have a glass, I'd like to have a glass protector for my, for my, for my phone.
[01:22:40.800 --> 01:22:43.480]   I just said, I think they were going to give me a case.
[01:22:43.480 --> 01:22:46.760]   I didn't realize he was going to bring out this whole like, Belkin made this thing, I
[01:22:46.760 --> 01:22:49.840]   think just for Apple, maybe it's for the other cell phone companies as well.
[01:22:49.840 --> 01:22:53.800]   But it's like a whole application process.
[01:22:53.800 --> 01:22:57.640]   Is it, is it like when you, when you go to the house of beef in San Francisco and they
[01:22:57.640 --> 01:22:58.640]   wheel out the Zeppelin?
[01:22:58.640 --> 01:22:59.640]   It's kind of like that.
[01:22:59.640 --> 01:23:02.800]   It's like, they were like, oh yeah, we got the same thing.
[01:23:02.800 --> 01:23:04.160]   But they don't, it doesn't even come in a box.
[01:23:04.160 --> 01:23:05.960]   It comes in like a, like a piece of plastic.
[01:23:05.960 --> 01:23:08.080]   They just kind of open it up and put it in.
[01:23:08.080 --> 01:23:11.440]   And so, but it is a, it's the fastest way ever seen that.
[01:23:11.440 --> 01:23:16.520]   Well, not only is it fast, it now looks like it was literally designed to be on the phone.
[01:23:16.520 --> 01:23:17.840]   Like it was when it was finished.
[01:23:17.840 --> 01:23:20.600]   When it was finished, it, it fits perfectly.
[01:23:20.600 --> 01:23:21.760]   It's perfectly registered.
[01:23:21.760 --> 01:23:23.440]   There's no bubbles.
[01:23:23.440 --> 01:23:29.160]   And now, like it's gone from, you know, there's an argument about whether, you know, you should
[01:23:29.160 --> 01:23:34.080]   have my, my former coworker at, at I'll assume, Ashu, it's, it was like you're, you're putting
[01:23:34.080 --> 01:23:36.360]   a plastic on your couch all the time.
[01:23:36.360 --> 01:23:38.160]   And, and it is kind of like that.
[01:23:38.160 --> 01:23:39.160]   I get that.
[01:23:39.160 --> 01:23:45.400]   But at the same time, the, it's, I like, I don't like scratches.
[01:23:45.400 --> 01:23:48.680]   So if I scratch it, I want to be able to pull it off and put another one on.
[01:23:48.680 --> 01:23:51.840]   And if, and in the past, I've lost a little bit on it.
[01:23:51.840 --> 01:23:54.320]   And so I've decided sometimes I don't want it on there.
[01:23:54.320 --> 01:23:56.840]   This is the first time like it is perfect.
[01:23:56.840 --> 01:23:59.600]   It is, it is a perfect application of, of this process.
[01:23:59.600 --> 01:24:01.160]   And it's done at the Apple store when you buy it.
[01:24:01.160 --> 01:24:02.520]   You can, I guess you can go in and just do it.
[01:24:02.520 --> 01:24:03.520]   You've already bought it.
[01:24:03.520 --> 01:24:04.520]   Um, I don't know.
[01:24:04.520 --> 01:24:07.320]   I, I think it's like 40 bucks.
[01:24:07.320 --> 01:24:10.640]   And I guess the process is free, but, but it's $40.
[01:24:10.640 --> 01:24:12.720]   It's $40 to buy it.
[01:24:12.720 --> 01:24:15.840]   But it's a, I think I was just more excited when he, I just thought I was going to buy
[01:24:15.840 --> 01:24:16.840]   it.
[01:24:16.840 --> 01:24:17.840]   I love the screen applicator.
[01:24:17.840 --> 01:24:19.200]   And then I was going to go through the, you know, you should put this on Reddit because
[01:24:19.200 --> 01:24:23.400]   it is one of those videos is just kind of curiously satisfying.
[01:24:23.400 --> 01:24:24.400]   It is.
[01:24:24.400 --> 01:24:25.400]   I will.
[01:24:25.400 --> 01:24:26.400]   I will.
[01:24:26.400 --> 01:24:27.400]   I will do it for your screen.
[01:24:27.400 --> 01:24:28.400]   It's kind of remarkable.
[01:24:28.400 --> 01:24:29.400]   It is.
[01:24:29.400 --> 01:24:33.600]   There's something about, I know Alton Brown hates like a unique tasker tools, but there
[01:24:33.600 --> 01:24:39.480]   is something about a bespoke tool that takes just only does one thing, but that one thing
[01:24:39.480 --> 01:24:41.920]   is incredibly complicated without it.
[01:24:41.920 --> 01:24:45.200]   And once you have it, it's like you want to do this all day long.
[01:24:45.200 --> 01:24:46.200]   It's so easy.
[01:24:46.200 --> 01:24:47.680]   Charles Emerson Winchester the third.
[01:24:47.680 --> 01:24:49.440]   One thing at a time.
[01:24:49.440 --> 01:24:50.440]   Very, very well.
[01:24:50.440 --> 01:24:53.200]   It was so, it was, it was always so stressful to do this.
[01:24:53.200 --> 01:24:54.680]   You never want to do it yourself.
[01:24:54.680 --> 01:24:57.280]   And it's always been this thing.
[01:24:57.280 --> 01:25:01.800]   And when you look at that device and you look at the whole process, they spent a lot
[01:25:01.800 --> 01:25:05.160]   of money and a lot of time figuring out how to do this well.
[01:25:05.160 --> 01:25:09.400]   Really because the biggest complaint against screen protectors like that is that it's hard
[01:25:09.400 --> 01:25:10.400]   to put them on well.
[01:25:10.400 --> 01:25:11.400]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:25:11.400 --> 01:25:16.400]   And so it's, it's, they figure out a way to, over the number one complaint.
[01:25:16.400 --> 01:25:21.520]   Oddly, ironically, you have an iPhone that is without a doubt the most robust iPhone
[01:25:21.520 --> 01:25:26.080]   Apple's ever made, we've had Lindsay Turrentine and her chief have seen it on Sunday on
[01:25:26.080 --> 01:25:27.080]   Twitch.
[01:25:27.080 --> 01:25:30.400]   She, she had a drop test on the iPhone XS.
[01:25:30.400 --> 01:25:32.480]   They could not, they could barely scratch it.
[01:25:32.480 --> 01:25:34.320]   They could not break it.
[01:25:34.320 --> 01:25:38.240]   Some people have, I would still be super, I mean, like some people don't do it on purpose.
[01:25:38.240 --> 01:25:39.240]   No, no.
[01:25:39.240 --> 01:25:44.080]   And even with testing, so much depends on angle and what surface it's on.
[01:25:44.080 --> 01:25:47.280]   And if there's any, like small perturbuses on that surface that could cause you, it's
[01:25:47.280 --> 01:25:50.000]   so it, yeah, you can break those things.
[01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:51.600]   And you could, I've dropped mine.
[01:25:51.600 --> 01:25:53.680]   Well, I'm not going to, I want to knock wood real hard now.
[01:25:53.680 --> 01:25:56.960]   I've dropped mine and it's fine, but I have seen them drop and break.
[01:25:56.960 --> 01:25:58.480]   So always be careful.
[01:25:58.480 --> 01:26:03.200]   Also, also realize that even though it might look fine, you could have created micro fractures
[01:26:03.200 --> 01:26:07.600]   that mean like the next time you drop it, it's just going to be like a Hollywood special
[01:26:07.600 --> 01:26:08.600]   effect is going to explode.
[01:26:08.600 --> 01:26:11.160]   Like don't use it as a diving camera.
[01:26:11.160 --> 01:26:12.160]   It is water resistant.
[01:26:12.160 --> 01:26:14.160]   Don't, don't use it as a diving camera.
[01:26:14.160 --> 01:26:19.440]   Remember that Darwin, that famous darn Darwin award about the, the lawyer giving the tour
[01:26:19.440 --> 01:26:23.760]   every, every month to like new interns in the office saying, and, and these windows on
[01:26:23.760 --> 01:26:25.680]   our 80th floor office are so strong.
[01:26:25.680 --> 01:26:29.680]   Look, I can run straight into it and it won't go through and nothing happens.
[01:26:29.680 --> 01:26:34.560]   And it worked the first like 30 times for the 31st time he wound up being an internet meme.
[01:26:34.560 --> 01:26:37.440]   Here's Vanessa dropping it.
[01:26:37.440 --> 01:26:38.440]   Uh, no.
[01:26:38.440 --> 01:26:39.440]   Thank you.
[01:26:39.440 --> 01:26:42.760]   Here's Vanessa dropping it over and over again.
[01:26:42.760 --> 01:26:47.400]   And oh, this is a shot from the iPhone while it's being dropped.
[01:26:47.400 --> 01:26:49.280]   She dropped it about four feet.
[01:26:49.280 --> 01:26:50.280]   Something like that.
[01:26:50.280 --> 01:26:51.280]   Just mean.
[01:26:51.280 --> 01:26:52.280]   I can't walk.
[01:26:52.280 --> 01:26:53.280]   I know it's hard to watch.
[01:26:53.280 --> 01:26:56.720]   Oh, God.
[01:26:56.720 --> 01:27:02.000]   But Lindsey said she, she saw the phone after the fact that it was barely, barely anything
[01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:03.000]   wrong with it.
[01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:05.720]   They even landed face down on the concrete.
[01:27:05.720 --> 01:27:06.720]   Yeesh.
[01:27:06.720 --> 01:27:10.800]   What's interesting this year is that usually like with chemistry, you've got a balance.
[01:27:10.800 --> 01:27:13.480]   Like the more scratch resistant you make it, the easier it is to shatter.
[01:27:13.480 --> 01:27:16.040]   The easier, the more shatter resistant, the easier it's a scratch.
[01:27:16.040 --> 01:27:20.160]   And Apple said it's tried its best with Corning to really improve both those things this
[01:27:20.160 --> 01:27:21.160]   year.
[01:27:21.160 --> 01:27:24.800]   I don't want to put it to test, but I'm happy that if it does save more people more time
[01:27:24.800 --> 01:27:25.800]   that's advanced.
[01:27:25.800 --> 01:27:28.000]   I don't even like see the little Nick that she's showing there.
[01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:29.000]   Yeah.
[01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:30.000]   She rubbed it out.
[01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:31.000]   It's going, it's going away.
[01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:32.000]   I don't even like those.
[01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:34.920]   I typically scratch mine with the back camera of the other phone.
[01:27:34.920 --> 01:27:35.920]   Like I'll have both phones.
[01:27:35.920 --> 01:27:39.200]   And for some reason I'll use the like one camera will scratch the other phone.
[01:27:39.200 --> 01:27:40.200]   All right.
[01:27:40.200 --> 01:27:41.440]   We're not recommending this at home.
[01:27:41.440 --> 01:27:46.000]   I'm just pointing out that you put a screen protector on a screen that's.
[01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:51.560]   You have no idea how much grit is in your pocket until you have like two phones in there.
[01:27:51.560 --> 01:27:55.760]   One piece of grit gets between them and then they start to and that's when you get scratches.
[01:27:55.760 --> 01:27:56.760]   Yeah.
[01:27:56.760 --> 01:27:59.280]   But I like I've never had a screen protector.
[01:27:59.280 --> 01:28:05.520]   I just I do keep a case on mine, but I kind of like what the on the Antiques Roadshow
[01:28:05.520 --> 01:28:08.320]   they refer to as good, honest wear.
[01:28:08.320 --> 01:28:12.640]   You know, I've note the thing I'm one of the things I'm happiest with about my now four
[01:28:12.640 --> 01:28:16.560]   year old camera is that now there's like the paint is like sort of rubbed off on the hard
[01:28:16.560 --> 01:28:20.320]   corners and says this is this was this is seen some stuff, man.
[01:28:20.320 --> 01:28:22.560]   So I don't mind a little bit of Nixon scratches.
[01:28:22.560 --> 01:28:29.640]   Johnny, I've awarded the 2018 Stephen Hawking Fellowship from the Cambridge Union Society.
[01:28:29.640 --> 01:28:35.280]   I was one of the most influential individuals in modern technology.
[01:28:35.280 --> 01:28:42.720]   He will speak during the Micklemus term at Cambridge University's debating chamber.
[01:28:42.720 --> 01:28:46.360]   In case you're case you're there for Micklemus.
[01:28:46.360 --> 01:28:49.720]   Hi, the to the for the I've debating chamber.
[01:28:49.720 --> 01:28:51.800]   Sir Johnny, he will be.
[01:28:51.800 --> 01:28:58.800]   First the blue Peter Gold badge and now this looks like the debating chamber looks kind
[01:28:58.800 --> 01:29:02.640]   of like if you've ever seen the British legislature.
[01:29:02.640 --> 01:29:04.280]   Yeah, like parliament.
[01:29:04.280 --> 01:29:13.120]   Yeah, we now learn are learning that in August 10th, the FBI searched the home of a suspect
[01:29:13.120 --> 01:29:17.640]   in Columbus, Ohio during a child abuse investigation.
[01:29:17.640 --> 01:29:24.200]   They had a search warrant and as part of that search warrant, FBI agents ordered the suspect
[01:29:24.200 --> 01:29:28.600]   to face the iPhone and trigger face ID.
[01:29:28.600 --> 01:29:31.680]   Yeah, that's a little bit.
[01:29:31.680 --> 01:29:36.440]   It's a little extra creepy or it's going to be problematic because this wasn't just them
[01:29:36.440 --> 01:29:37.840]   testing the limits of a warrant.
[01:29:37.840 --> 01:29:40.440]   The warrant actually explicitly spelled out.
[01:29:40.440 --> 01:29:44.920]   Here's what we might want to get and it will include biometric information used for collecting
[01:29:44.920 --> 01:29:46.000]   this data.
[01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:50.880]   So it was all spelled out in the warrant and as this guy was in the position of there's
[01:29:50.880 --> 01:29:52.160]   no way I can turn this down.
[01:29:52.160 --> 01:29:53.720]   This is spelled out.
[01:29:53.720 --> 01:29:58.880]   Apparently police are now using boiler plate language and warrants to cover face ID.
[01:29:58.880 --> 01:30:02.480]   Now, they have done fingerprint with such ID in the past.
[01:30:02.480 --> 01:30:04.800]   And you hit the power button twice, is that right?
[01:30:04.800 --> 01:30:05.800]   Or you hit it?
[01:30:05.800 --> 01:30:07.000]   No, you squeeze the phone.
[01:30:07.000 --> 01:30:08.000]   Squeeze the phone.
[01:30:08.000 --> 01:30:09.800]   Yeah, there's two sides.
[01:30:09.800 --> 01:30:11.520]   And so I mean, that's just something to know.
[01:30:11.520 --> 01:30:12.760]   I'm glad this person got caught.
[01:30:12.760 --> 01:30:14.760]   Evidently they got caught in pornography.
[01:30:14.760 --> 01:30:16.200]   So I'm not saying that they should have done it.
[01:30:16.200 --> 01:30:19.800]   But if you're worried about it on your own, squeezing the phone on either side before
[01:30:19.800 --> 01:30:22.800]   you hand it to someone can be done fairly subtly.
[01:30:22.800 --> 01:30:24.280]   And then it removes that.
[01:30:24.280 --> 01:30:27.120]   And now the other thing that I think that I don't know if we saw on the news here is
[01:30:27.120 --> 01:30:33.040]   that I guess in New Zealand, they're passing a law that says that you got a $5,000.
[01:30:33.040 --> 01:30:40.000]   If they ask for your electronics, you can pay a $5,000 fine if you don't hand it over.
[01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:42.440]   Now they say it's got to be reasonable.
[01:30:42.440 --> 01:30:44.080]   But remember that New Zealand is part of it.
[01:30:44.080 --> 01:30:48.920]   They have to have probable cause in effect to suspect you've wrongdoing.
[01:30:48.920 --> 01:30:54.320]   It's the custom and excise act of 2018 comes into effect today in New Zealand.
[01:30:54.320 --> 01:30:58.520]   And you can't refuse a digital search.
[01:30:58.520 --> 01:31:00.200]   You cannot refuse a digital search.
[01:31:00.200 --> 01:31:02.840]   If you do, you'll be fined up to $5,000.
[01:31:02.840 --> 01:31:06.560]   Your device will be seized and they'll search it for you anyway.
[01:31:06.560 --> 01:31:09.960]   New Zealand and Australia are both having these kind of problems.
[01:31:09.960 --> 01:31:14.680]   And worldwide, it's customs that are trying, it's customs that are at the bleeding edge
[01:31:14.680 --> 01:31:19.280]   of this because historically for hundreds of years, there's been the principle of law
[01:31:19.280 --> 01:31:24.280]   that the country has a right to control anything that's going inside, going into the country.
[01:31:24.280 --> 01:31:28.080]   And that can extend to if you're carrying documents, we have the right to ask for those
[01:31:28.080 --> 01:31:30.240]   documents if you're carrying them in the country.
[01:31:30.240 --> 01:31:33.200]   Or we have the right to simply tell you that you'll get to come in.
[01:31:33.200 --> 01:31:35.680]   So this stuff is going to be tested.
[01:31:35.680 --> 01:31:41.320]   And by the way, it's perfectly fine to be incredibly conflicted about a lot of this.
[01:31:41.320 --> 01:31:48.040]   I'm very, very bothered by the requirement to unlock and decrypt documents that you
[01:31:48.040 --> 01:31:54.400]   have encrypted because I think that part of an additional member of the Bill of Rights
[01:31:54.400 --> 01:31:59.160]   should be that we have the right to keep secrets from everybody else if we want to.
[01:31:59.160 --> 01:32:03.440]   However, it's also okay, excuse me, it's important to notice that because this phone
[01:32:03.440 --> 01:32:09.240]   was unlocked, it's not only got the evidence against this person who was in possession
[01:32:09.240 --> 01:32:14.000]   of child pornography, but also connections to the other people in the pipeline of where
[01:32:14.000 --> 01:32:18.240]   he got it from, other people he might have been swapping stuff with.
[01:32:18.240 --> 01:32:22.760]   And so it's again, I'm so conflicted about a lot of the stuff.
[01:32:22.760 --> 01:32:28.720]   I just keep falling back on the basic things where the basic principle that we've just
[01:32:28.720 --> 01:32:36.120]   chosen to be a society where we'd much rather retain personal freedoms and let the occasional
[01:32:36.120 --> 01:32:41.760]   guilty person go free for lack of evidence than treat everybody walking down the street
[01:32:41.760 --> 01:32:45.400]   as though they're potential criminal and have fewer criminals on the street.
[01:32:45.400 --> 01:32:46.400]   That's the choice we made.
[01:32:46.400 --> 01:32:48.400]   I think the mistake the governments are making.
[01:32:48.400 --> 01:32:52.640]   I mean, I think that they have the right to do what they're going to do, obviously, but
[01:32:52.640 --> 01:32:56.640]   I think that the mistake that they're making is by doing things that are overt like this,
[01:32:56.640 --> 01:33:02.120]   they are creating a sensitivity towards privacy where I think that they were actually doing,
[01:33:02.120 --> 01:33:04.800]   they're doing pretty well before they started coming up over the radar.
[01:33:04.800 --> 01:33:06.880]   So they, as far as gathering this information.
[01:33:06.880 --> 01:33:12.440]   And so they had all this information and if they just quietly did it and didn't push,
[01:33:12.440 --> 01:33:15.240]   didn't push the envelope, they wouldn't have everybody thinking about it and they wouldn't
[01:33:15.240 --> 01:33:18.200]   have companies building entire business plans around thordiness.
[01:33:18.200 --> 01:33:21.880]   And so they're actually going to damage their ability to do it and then they're going to
[01:33:21.880 --> 01:33:25.560]   have to, you know, then what's going to happen is they're going to have to write a law that
[01:33:25.560 --> 01:33:30.400]   is that will appear to the public as horrible and they're going to end up with a, you know,
[01:33:30.400 --> 01:33:34.560]   they're going to end up with this huge fight with their population where before they did
[01:33:34.560 --> 01:33:39.280]   that, they were actually getting an equal, I mean, more data than they've ever had before.
[01:33:39.280 --> 01:33:43.840]   I mean, they have this crystal clear, you know, HD view of us and there's like three
[01:33:43.840 --> 01:33:47.600]   or four pixels that aren't there and they're trying to force those last three or four pixels
[01:33:47.600 --> 01:33:51.000]   and they're going to lose half of it in the middle of all of this or they're going to
[01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:54.520]   end up in near revolution when people start saying, well, you can't, you can't keep on
[01:33:54.520 --> 01:33:56.880]   doing this because, you know, what's going to happen with New Zealand?
[01:33:56.880 --> 01:34:02.200]   I mean, with all this New Zealand's part of the information part of an information network
[01:34:02.200 --> 01:34:05.760]   with the United States, you know, New Zealand, Australia and a couple other countries.
[01:34:05.760 --> 01:34:10.080]   So you know, what will happen is that the, you know, intelligence agency in the United
[01:34:10.080 --> 01:34:12.680]   States will say, we need you to search this person when they land.
[01:34:12.680 --> 01:34:15.800]   We need their electronics and what they'll do is they'll pull the electronics for New
[01:34:15.800 --> 01:34:17.920]   Zealand and they'll send it back to the United States.
[01:34:17.920 --> 01:34:21.440]   You know, like that's how this is all going to, you know, how it's going to come through.
[01:34:21.440 --> 01:34:27.120]   So the, so I think that the governments are making a mistake by making it such an overt
[01:34:27.120 --> 01:34:30.440]   process and because they're not going to win.
[01:34:30.440 --> 01:34:32.440]   You know, they're not, you know, like this is not.
[01:34:32.440 --> 01:34:38.560]   Well, I think that I think they eventually are because it's the worst kind of arms race
[01:34:38.560 --> 01:34:45.000]   because the if we can't, if we can't stop a country, if we can't travel with a phone
[01:34:45.000 --> 01:34:50.680]   or even carry a phone with us in a car that might have a busted headlight without wearing
[01:34:50.680 --> 01:34:53.240]   that that phone could be searched.
[01:34:53.240 --> 01:34:56.240]   The step one is, okay, you know, there's a shortcut that will lock the phone and allow
[01:34:56.240 --> 01:34:59.600]   it refused to allow it to be unlocked with biometrics.
[01:34:59.600 --> 01:35:04.560]   The next step, and then they will find a way legally around that to simply say, well, you're
[01:35:04.560 --> 01:35:06.840]   going to have to provide the biometrics to open this up.
[01:35:06.840 --> 01:35:10.920]   And then the next step is going to be for Apple, I hope Apple and Google to say, okay,
[01:35:10.920 --> 01:35:14.000]   here is a, here is the Jason Bourne hidden feature.
[01:35:14.000 --> 01:35:17.920]   If you hit the power button five times in a row, it will actually delete the encryption
[01:35:17.920 --> 01:35:20.920]   key on your phone and render all the content of it unrecoverable.
[01:35:20.920 --> 01:35:24.720]   It will put it right back into factory mode, which is something that I would, that if
[01:35:24.720 --> 01:35:28.000]   I were traveling to certain hostile countries, I would certainly consider doing.
[01:35:28.000 --> 01:35:30.000]   I was glad to use your, I agree with you.
[01:35:30.000 --> 01:35:34.400]   That's what, and then what happened, then the fear after that is now they're going to
[01:35:34.400 --> 01:35:40.600]   say they have the only way for them to protect that source of potential source of evidence
[01:35:40.600 --> 01:35:45.280]   is to make it illegal for phones to be encrypted or to insist that there be a backdoor that
[01:35:45.280 --> 01:35:47.080]   cannot be defeated.
[01:35:47.080 --> 01:35:50.240]   So I'm very, very worried about what we're going to see over the next five or 10 years
[01:35:50.240 --> 01:35:54.760]   as law enforcement who are again, I have so much sympathy for them.
[01:35:54.760 --> 01:36:00.720]   This is, there's so much work that they can't do if people have the ability to have access
[01:36:00.720 --> 01:36:06.640]   to files that government cannot possibly locate or decrypt, but they're going to get increasingly
[01:36:06.640 --> 01:36:08.720]   desperate or increasingly frustrated.
[01:36:08.720 --> 01:36:14.240]   And while we need as the right people or the wrong people in the lawmaking seats to make
[01:36:14.240 --> 01:36:18.120]   really horrible anti-privacy laws even worse.
[01:36:18.120 --> 01:36:22.560]   But I think, and again, that, that, and I think that they were doing, we do have to,
[01:36:22.560 --> 01:36:24.160]   I do agree with you, we have to balance this.
[01:36:24.160 --> 01:36:29.480]   I mean, the reason that we as, I mean, I work in a lot of places around the world and some
[01:36:29.480 --> 01:36:32.280]   of them are pretty rough.
[01:36:32.280 --> 01:36:36.440]   The reason that we live in houses without fences all the way around us, and the reason
[01:36:36.440 --> 01:36:39.840]   that every block, there's places that I work where every block there's someone with an
[01:36:39.840 --> 01:36:44.680]   AK-47 or an M-16 or whatever is holding, you know, like looking out.
[01:36:44.680 --> 01:36:47.680]   The reason that we have that in the United, that we don't have that in the United States
[01:36:47.680 --> 01:36:51.200]   is because of all this intelligence, you know, because of what they're doing with the phones,
[01:36:51.200 --> 01:36:56.400]   but because of what the NSA does, like let's be clear that that is why we can have the
[01:36:56.400 --> 01:36:58.280]   life that we have in the United States.
[01:36:58.280 --> 01:37:03.960]   So we have to always take that into account when we talk through this is that they're
[01:37:03.960 --> 01:37:11.200]   having that ability is what doesn't have a bomb going off every day, you know, somewhere
[01:37:11.200 --> 01:37:15.280]   in the United States and doesn't have things that seem very soft be attacked.
[01:37:15.280 --> 01:37:18.520]   So these things are, it's a very important conversation.
[01:37:18.520 --> 01:37:22.240]   I just, I'm not saying that they shouldn't be getting the data.
[01:37:22.240 --> 01:37:28.040]   I'm just saying that bi overtly, you know, going after this, you know, I think that they
[01:37:28.040 --> 01:37:32.520]   are risking getting into this huge push because I think that they will have trouble making
[01:37:32.520 --> 01:37:37.040]   those laws because they, you know, until there's a huge, you know, what what'll happen is the
[01:37:37.040 --> 01:37:42.280]   when that will happen is after a huge terrorist act because they'll use that as the next reason
[01:37:42.280 --> 01:37:43.640]   to go down that path.
[01:37:43.640 --> 01:37:46.520]   They won't be able to do it just randomly because it's, you know, and that's what they
[01:37:46.520 --> 01:37:51.240]   try to do with San Bernardino, you know, as they use, they want to use that to, you know,
[01:37:51.240 --> 01:37:55.440]   to close up this little, to close up the gaps that they want to, that they want to go through.
[01:37:55.440 --> 01:37:58.520]   But without that, I mean, people are going to be concerned and they should be concerned
[01:37:58.520 --> 01:38:03.480]   about, I mean, it's you, the data is something that it's fine when you think that everybody's
[01:38:03.480 --> 01:38:04.480]   doing the right thing.
[01:38:04.480 --> 01:38:08.400]   But what happens, you know, we've already had reports of intelligence agencies getting
[01:38:08.400 --> 01:38:12.320]   a hold of that and individual human beings taking advantage of the fact that they have
[01:38:12.320 --> 01:38:14.600]   that data to look at things that they're not supposed to be looking at.
[01:38:14.600 --> 01:38:17.840]   That's the that's the problem you get into.
[01:38:17.840 --> 01:38:19.280]   I'm in the mood for some olive oil.
[01:38:19.280 --> 01:38:20.840]   I don't know about you.
[01:38:20.840 --> 01:38:21.840]   Oh, man.
[01:38:21.840 --> 01:38:22.840]   I want some.
[01:38:22.840 --> 01:38:25.120]   Don't, don't, don't, don't make that go down easier.
[01:38:25.120 --> 01:38:26.120]   What?
[01:38:26.120 --> 01:38:28.120]   Some nice flavorful.
[01:38:28.120 --> 01:38:32.120]   Trace Pontes premium quality.
[01:38:32.120 --> 01:38:33.960]   Extra virgin olive oil.
[01:38:33.960 --> 01:38:35.160]   That's what I'm talking about.
[01:38:35.160 --> 01:38:37.000]   We were in Spain.
[01:38:37.000 --> 01:38:42.560]   I think Spain is the number one olive oil producer, maybe number two after Italy in the
[01:38:42.560 --> 01:38:44.360]   world.
[01:38:44.360 --> 01:38:48.640]   And we went to this beautiful, oh, I guess it was France.
[01:38:48.640 --> 01:38:53.800]   We're in France and Provence and a beautiful place where they made olive oil and they had
[01:38:53.800 --> 01:38:59.080]   this 300 year old olive tree and we tasted all the olive oil and they said, Oh, no, we
[01:38:59.080 --> 01:39:00.080]   are very proud.
[01:39:00.080 --> 01:39:02.320]   It's less than 0.4% acidity.
[01:39:02.320 --> 01:39:08.400]   And I thought, you know, I've got a better olive oil at home actually handpicked from
[01:39:08.400 --> 01:39:10.840]   the Casablanca Valley in Chile.
[01:39:10.840 --> 01:39:12.400]   It's trace Pontes.
[01:39:12.400 --> 01:39:17.280]   Less than 0.2%, actually, in most cases, much less than 0.2%.
[01:39:17.280 --> 01:39:20.360]   It is the sweetest, smoothest olive oil.
[01:39:20.360 --> 01:39:25.800]   And if you love the trace Pontes coffee that we talk about all the time, as much as I do,
[01:39:25.800 --> 01:39:29.680]   you're going to love this gourmet extra virgin olive oil.
[01:39:29.680 --> 01:39:34.560]   So this is actually becoming their mission at trace Pontes to search the world to find
[01:39:34.560 --> 01:39:41.480]   the best small single family farms that have never imported into the United States and
[01:39:41.480 --> 01:39:46.120]   to create a great farm to table experience for us.
[01:39:46.120 --> 01:39:51.800]   This all this amazing olive oil comes from Jose Miguel Arnaz's orchard in Chile in the
[01:39:51.800 --> 01:39:53.440]   Casablanca Valley.
[01:39:53.440 --> 01:39:56.960]   It is one of the few valleys in Chile with optimum conditions for producing a premium
[01:39:56.960 --> 01:39:58.600]   Evo.
[01:39:58.600 --> 01:40:02.600]   As with everything trace Pontes does, there's a, I think I could do it right now, there's
[01:40:02.600 --> 01:40:07.080]   a QR code we could scan on the olive oil bottle.
[01:40:07.080 --> 01:40:12.040]   So you can see exactly where the olive trees were.
[01:40:12.040 --> 01:40:14.320]   Let's see, open in Google Maps.
[01:40:14.320 --> 01:40:19.120]   There they are, the olive trees that this olive oil came from.
[01:40:19.120 --> 01:40:21.280]   I love it.
[01:40:21.280 --> 01:40:26.520]   Right there in that particular olive orchard, right there.
[01:40:26.520 --> 01:40:32.480]   Acidity is, it's actually one quarter what it has to be to be called extra virgin olive
[01:40:32.480 --> 01:40:33.840]   oil.
[01:40:33.840 --> 01:40:36.480]   Because they do something very important.
[01:40:36.480 --> 01:40:38.560]   They extract it by natural means.
[01:40:38.560 --> 01:40:41.920]   They squeeze it, no chemicals, no heat.
[01:40:41.920 --> 01:40:47.240]   They prioritize aroma, flavor and quality over yield.
[01:40:47.240 --> 01:40:51.480]   They use five different premium olive varietals.
[01:40:51.480 --> 01:40:53.520]   The flavor profile, I know Alex, you've tried it.
[01:40:53.520 --> 01:40:56.040]   We've sent some out to you guys too.
[01:40:56.040 --> 01:40:59.680]   Even my kids like it, which is not something I expected, but you know, we dip the, the
[01:40:59.680 --> 01:41:00.680]   pre-dinner.
[01:41:00.680 --> 01:41:02.080]   It's so good you can spread in it.
[01:41:02.080 --> 01:41:06.760]   The pre-dinner thing now is, which I don't usually eat very much bread and is dipping
[01:41:06.760 --> 01:41:09.400]   the bread into the, into the olive oil.
[01:41:09.400 --> 01:41:10.400]   And we didn't do it before.
[01:41:10.400 --> 01:41:11.400]   I mean, it's just so good.
[01:41:11.400 --> 01:41:13.400]   It teaches you all the kids like it a lot.
[01:41:13.400 --> 01:41:14.400]   Of course it's no.
[01:41:14.400 --> 01:41:17.240]   This one with the psalm of vinaigrette or a little.
[01:41:17.240 --> 01:41:18.240]   So good.
[01:41:18.240 --> 01:41:22.280]   Well, I'll often have like, I'll have like a, I'll fix myself like a real lunch.
[01:41:22.280 --> 01:41:27.160]   And then for dinner, I will, it will just be a plate of cheeses, a half loaf of Italian
[01:41:27.160 --> 01:41:32.120]   bread that I got, that I got the store like the day before and just a little saucer.
[01:41:32.120 --> 01:41:33.120]   It was really good.
[01:41:33.120 --> 01:41:34.960]   And it's like really good.
[01:41:34.960 --> 01:41:39.120]   And so instead of like A instead of cooking and B instead of adding another 800 calories
[01:41:39.120 --> 01:41:44.080]   or 1000 calories, it's like very continental and it's tasty and it's like, and yeah, it's
[01:41:44.080 --> 01:41:48.320]   when you, when you taste, when you taste the goods, it's the things like must, like mustards
[01:41:48.320 --> 01:41:49.600]   and olive oils.
[01:41:49.600 --> 01:41:54.240]   The difference between like the cheap stuff and the good stuff is within range of most
[01:41:54.240 --> 01:41:55.320]   people.
[01:41:55.320 --> 01:41:59.840]   And it's the different, the improvement is disproportionate in relationship to the amount
[01:41:59.840 --> 01:42:00.840]   of extra money you spend.
[01:42:00.840 --> 01:42:04.200]   It's like, can you buy a really good olive oil or really good mustard?
[01:42:04.200 --> 01:42:09.000]   It's like, my God, now, now I'm buying the store brand ham, but now my mouth does not
[01:42:09.000 --> 01:42:10.560]   know it because this.
[01:42:10.560 --> 01:42:15.680]   Well, I'll be honest, you get this at such a good price because we got a great discount
[01:42:15.680 --> 01:42:16.680]   for you.
[01:42:16.680 --> 01:42:19.400]   I don't just use it for like putting on salad or eating bread.
[01:42:19.400 --> 01:42:21.160]   I use it for cooking too.
[01:42:21.160 --> 01:42:22.440]   I have a squeeze bottle.
[01:42:22.440 --> 01:42:26.780]   I keep loaded with trace ponces olive oil because I cook with olive oil, almost everything with
[01:42:26.780 --> 01:42:27.780]   olive oil now.
[01:42:27.780 --> 01:42:30.360]   I think it's better for you and it sure does taste good.

[01:43:09.760 --> 01:43:14.320]   I grew up in a house because my mom cooked Italian where we had a can, one of those
[01:43:14.320 --> 01:43:18.440]   big cans of all Italian olive oil next to the stove all the time.
[01:43:18.440 --> 01:43:19.880]   For me, it's chilli now.
[01:43:19.880 --> 01:43:20.880]   I'll tell you.
[01:43:20.880 --> 01:43:22.680]   My mom loves this better.

[01:43:49.440 --> 01:43:52.720]   I've talked to the trace ponces guys, you know, and they originally just were going
[01:43:52.720 --> 01:43:53.720]   to do coffee.
[01:43:53.720 --> 01:43:57.120]   They found this olive oil and they said, "All right, we're going to do olive oil."
[01:43:57.120 --> 01:44:03.600]   And I said, "You really could make a business out of farm to table, single family farm,
[01:44:03.600 --> 01:44:07.520]   getting the best ingredients somewhere in the world and offering them to our audience."
[01:44:07.520 --> 01:44:08.840]   And I think they might start doing that.
[01:44:08.840 --> 01:44:09.840]   I hope they do.
[01:44:09.840 --> 01:44:12.960]   But they've got two to start, the coffee and the olive oil.
[01:44:12.960 --> 01:44:18.240]   And they really are good at finding this amazing, amazing stuff.
[01:44:18.240 --> 01:44:19.240]   Thanks.
[01:44:19.240 --> 01:44:23.920]   We should really thank Jose Miguel Arnez for making the best olive oil I've ever had.
[01:44:23.920 --> 01:44:28.680]   traceponces.com/macbreak.
[01:44:28.680 --> 01:44:32.800]   Just checking Paul Thorett's Twitter because as you know, Microsoft is having an event
[01:44:32.800 --> 01:44:34.080]   right now.
[01:44:34.080 --> 01:44:35.800]   So far, nothing to report.
[01:44:35.800 --> 01:44:39.840]   Wait a minute, three new tweets have just come in.
[01:44:39.840 --> 01:44:44.400]   No USB-C on Surface Pro.
[01:44:44.400 --> 01:44:45.400]   That sucks.
[01:44:45.400 --> 01:44:47.120]   Okay, that's it.
[01:44:47.120 --> 01:44:51.000]   However, Windows 10 version 10, 1809 is coming out today.
[01:44:51.000 --> 01:44:52.000]   Oh boy.
[01:44:52.000 --> 01:44:53.000]   Oh boy.
[01:44:53.000 --> 01:44:55.920]   So we'll have to find out more.
[01:44:55.920 --> 01:44:57.720]   Does that mean it has a lightning port?
[01:44:57.720 --> 01:44:58.720]   I'm very confused.
[01:44:58.720 --> 01:45:01.640]   No, it has that stupid Surface Connect.
[01:45:01.640 --> 01:45:02.640]   Yeah.
[01:45:02.640 --> 01:45:03.640]   It's got to see.
[01:45:03.640 --> 01:45:06.640]   Oh, let's see for mobile.
[01:45:06.640 --> 01:45:10.320]   "Panos Penite took away Thorett's Surface and it's getting weird now."
[01:45:10.320 --> 01:45:11.520]   Uh oh.
[01:45:11.520 --> 01:45:13.520]   It's the Surface Pro blog.
[01:45:13.520 --> 01:45:16.520]   Oh, it's the Surface Pro blog.
[01:45:16.520 --> 01:45:17.520]   Alright.
[01:45:17.520 --> 01:45:22.360]   Let's get our picks of the week and I'll keep you posted on this, starting with Renee
[01:45:22.360 --> 01:45:24.000]   Richie.
[01:45:24.000 --> 01:45:29.120]   So my pick, if you're familiar with Lineo, which is a great iPad art application, I mean,
[01:45:29.120 --> 01:45:33.480]   you can take notes with it, you can do art with it, you can do brain boggling with it.
[01:45:33.480 --> 01:45:37.240]   Almost anything that you can use an Apple Pencil for on the iPad Pro, you can use in
[01:45:37.240 --> 01:45:38.240]   Lineo.
[01:45:38.240 --> 01:45:40.480]   It's by the icon factory who have been making phenomenal apps.
[01:45:40.480 --> 01:45:41.480]   Love their stuff.
[01:45:41.480 --> 01:45:42.480]   It's time immemorial.
[01:45:42.480 --> 01:45:43.480]   Absolutely.
[01:45:43.480 --> 01:45:45.040]   You can get out of the Twitter business, I guess.
[01:45:45.040 --> 01:45:49.280]   Oh, well, I think Twitter is getting them out of the Twitter business.
[01:45:49.280 --> 01:45:54.160]   So with the advent of the iPhone XS and especially, I guess, the iPhone XS Max, they've made
[01:45:54.160 --> 01:45:55.600]   a version for the iPhone.
[01:45:55.600 --> 01:45:58.080]   It's called Lineo Go, sort of like the Titans.
[01:45:58.080 --> 01:46:00.920]   Go, or Go.
[01:46:00.920 --> 01:46:01.920]   And it's just great.
[01:46:01.920 --> 01:46:05.200]   Of course, the first thing I did was draw Batman because that's the first thing that
[01:46:05.200 --> 01:46:06.200]   I do with any--
[01:46:06.200 --> 01:46:07.200]   That's my test.
[01:46:07.200 --> 01:46:08.200]   That's my test.
[01:46:08.200 --> 01:46:12.160]   I wish, I really wish there was Apple Pencil support for the iPhone XS Max.
[01:46:12.160 --> 01:46:14.120]   Of course, that's not the icon factory's fault.
[01:46:14.120 --> 01:46:15.400]   It's Apple's fault.
[01:46:15.400 --> 01:46:18.920]   But what you can do, even with your finger or regular stylists, is still miraculous.
[01:46:18.920 --> 01:46:23.280]   It's got-- they've taken the same sort of really good, minimal but discoverable tools,
[01:46:23.280 --> 01:46:25.400]   and they've made them all available to you.
[01:46:25.400 --> 01:46:27.960]   And I've always loved-- it's one of the things I like about the Galaxy Note.
[01:46:27.960 --> 01:46:33.360]   I've always loved the idea of a small digital field notes or drawing book in my pocket.
[01:46:33.360 --> 01:46:35.720]   And Lineo really delivers with that.
[01:46:35.720 --> 01:46:36.720]   It's just--
[01:46:36.720 --> 01:46:37.720]   It's really good for artists.
[01:46:37.720 --> 01:46:38.720]   It's really good for notes.
[01:46:38.720 --> 01:46:40.560]   They're all a bunch of artists.
[01:46:40.560 --> 01:46:46.160]   So when you look at what GED or some of the other people they're doing, or-- I'm going
[01:46:46.160 --> 01:46:50.280]   to blank on his name-- Rob, who does all the Star Trek storyboards.
[01:46:50.280 --> 01:46:51.800]   He's been putting up some of his pictures.
[01:46:51.800 --> 01:46:52.800]   Oh, yeah.
[01:46:52.800 --> 01:46:53.800]   He's been doing on it.
[01:46:53.800 --> 01:46:55.920]   And he is just so good.
[01:46:55.920 --> 01:47:01.120]   So if you have any artistic tendencies and you want to take advantage of that gorgeous,
[01:47:01.120 --> 01:47:08.120]   ginormous, almost tiny tablet scale iPhone XS Max screen, Lineo Go is an amazing app to
[01:47:08.120 --> 01:47:09.120]   do it with.
[01:47:09.120 --> 01:47:12.480]   Line in American dollars in the app store.
[01:47:12.480 --> 01:47:17.840]   I have such a strong recommendation to have a good art app on your phone because it's
[01:47:17.840 --> 01:47:21.960]   because you'll-- yes, you can't draw a lick for your to save your life.
[01:47:21.960 --> 01:47:26.080]   But if you have that on your phone and you start to get in the habit of while you're
[01:47:26.080 --> 01:47:31.800]   waiting for the bus or while you're on the train or commute home to just sketch, if you
[01:47:31.800 --> 01:47:36.360]   just get into the habit of instead of doing Facebook or social media or whatever, if you
[01:47:36.360 --> 01:47:37.880]   use that to unwind.
[01:47:37.880 --> 01:47:41.960]   Two years later, you will have forgotten that you've gotten into this habit and then you'll
[01:47:41.960 --> 01:47:45.600]   be able to see your first picture and then your most recent picture and you're like,
[01:47:45.600 --> 01:47:46.600]   I'll be damned.
[01:47:46.600 --> 01:47:50.760]   All I had to do was draw for 20 minutes a day for two years and now I'm kind of good.
[01:47:50.760 --> 01:47:51.760]   Yeah.
[01:47:51.760 --> 01:47:53.680]   I was surprised it had just bought it.
[01:47:53.680 --> 01:47:54.680]   The I did too.
[01:47:54.680 --> 01:47:59.280]   In the time that you've done it, I bought it, opened it and started drawing pictures.
[01:47:59.280 --> 01:48:04.840]   I was surprised at how good the pressure sensitivity is with my finger.
[01:48:04.840 --> 01:48:06.840]   I'm really getting-- I can really--
[01:48:06.840 --> 01:48:08.080]   Pencil tool is so good.
[01:48:08.080 --> 01:48:10.160]   I use the Judge Art Apps by Pencil Tools a lot.
[01:48:10.160 --> 01:48:13.280]   It's just one of my things and the Pencil Tool is really good.
[01:48:13.280 --> 01:48:16.520]   It also has a zip line tool that helps to draw straight lines.
[01:48:16.520 --> 01:48:20.200]   I like that because I can't even draw a straight line.
[01:48:20.200 --> 01:48:21.200]   Nice.
[01:48:21.200 --> 01:48:22.200]   Good pick.
[01:48:22.200 --> 01:48:23.200]   That's great.
[01:48:23.200 --> 01:48:29.400]   Here is a-- speaking of picks, a picture from the Surface Event, Mary Jo Foley, taking
[01:48:29.400 --> 01:48:33.760]   of Paul Therott and Brad Sams and that is just unholy.
[01:48:33.760 --> 01:48:36.760]   I am so glad I'm missing this.
[01:48:36.760 --> 01:48:37.920]   You own a lot of leg there.
[01:48:37.920 --> 01:48:41.480]   That's a lot like boys.
[01:48:41.480 --> 01:48:45.280]   Apparently both have a kind of fascination with slip-ons and half-socks.
[01:48:45.280 --> 01:48:46.280]   So--
[01:48:46.280 --> 01:48:47.280]   Wait a minute.
[01:48:47.280 --> 01:48:48.280]   Is Rubino not working?
[01:48:48.280 --> 01:48:49.280]   I'm just checking this crowd.
[01:48:49.280 --> 01:48:50.280]   Let's see who's there.
[01:48:50.280 --> 01:48:51.280]   I see Tom's guide.
[01:48:51.280 --> 01:48:53.600]   I see Niele Patel there.
[01:48:53.600 --> 01:48:54.600]   Yeah.
[01:48:54.600 --> 01:48:55.600]   Is that--
[01:48:55.600 --> 01:48:56.600]   Here is this?
[01:48:56.600 --> 01:48:58.600]   This is in-- I think it's New York, right?
[01:48:58.600 --> 01:48:59.600]   Yeah.
[01:48:59.600 --> 01:49:00.600]   I think so.
[01:49:00.600 --> 01:49:01.600]   This is a small room.
[01:49:01.600 --> 01:49:02.600]   That's it.
[01:49:02.600 --> 01:49:03.960]   We're just doing it or we would be covering it.
[01:49:03.960 --> 01:49:04.960]   But they're not streamin' it.
[01:49:04.960 --> 01:49:06.160]   So we'll just have to give you updates.
[01:49:06.160 --> 01:49:07.760]   It looks like someone's living room.
[01:49:07.760 --> 01:49:08.760]   That's--
[01:49:08.760 --> 01:49:09.760]   It is.
[01:49:09.760 --> 01:49:12.680]   And I think that's what Microsoft is saying, by the way, according to Mary Jo Foley, is
[01:49:12.680 --> 01:49:15.760]   they want the tech to disappear.
[01:49:15.760 --> 01:49:19.160]   It's a new vision.
[01:49:19.160 --> 01:49:25.560]   Microsoft is framing Surface Windows and Office Vision with modern life services.
[01:49:25.560 --> 01:49:26.560]   They want to--
[01:49:26.560 --> 01:49:29.960]   Did they disappear at the Rose Pat legs too?
[01:49:29.960 --> 01:49:32.440]   They disappeared as Pat legs.
[01:49:32.440 --> 01:49:33.440]   Microsoft.
[01:49:33.440 --> 01:49:34.440]   It's Microsoft.
[01:49:34.440 --> 01:49:36.000]   It's turn of damage with consumers by turn of position.
[01:49:36.000 --> 01:49:39.160]   It's cross-platform apps and services making them more productive.
[01:49:39.160 --> 01:49:42.840]   Actually, this is an older article, but this is just the next step in this with the new
[01:49:42.840 --> 01:49:43.840]   Surface.
[01:49:43.840 --> 01:49:44.840]   All right.
[01:49:44.840 --> 01:49:48.480]   We'll keep you up today.
[01:49:48.480 --> 01:49:50.400]   Alex Lindsey, pick of the week.
[01:49:50.400 --> 01:49:52.760]   So it's coming out this month.
[01:49:52.760 --> 01:49:57.720]   I think I'm not sure if I'm shipping yet, but this is a Maxon, of course, is my favorite
[01:49:57.720 --> 01:49:58.800]   3D app.
[01:49:58.800 --> 01:50:05.520]   And so Maxon Cinema 4D is the thing that I use to put stuff together, and they've got
[01:50:05.520 --> 01:50:06.520]   great updates.
[01:50:06.520 --> 01:50:08.440]   One of the things I'm most excited about, and this--
[01:50:08.440 --> 01:50:12.520]   I'm not going to get into all the inside baseball stuff that's a little crazy, but node-based
[01:50:12.520 --> 01:50:13.520]   materials.
[01:50:13.520 --> 01:50:20.680]   Now, what that means is that you can basically build very, very complex materials that allow
[01:50:20.680 --> 01:50:24.760]   you to basically say, "I'm going to take this attribute from this Surface and then reconnected."
[01:50:24.760 --> 01:50:25.760]   I wish--
[01:50:25.760 --> 01:50:27.680]   I mean, I've done a lot of node-based stuff.
[01:50:27.680 --> 01:50:31.200]   And so it's how you use the high-end compositors.
[01:50:31.200 --> 01:50:38.440]   And it's something that lets you build very complex texture maps that will really fill
[01:50:38.440 --> 01:50:43.600]   out just a lot of details that are very hard to do, otherwise with layers.
[01:50:43.600 --> 01:50:45.080]   Standard layers mean I'm going to take this thing.
[01:50:45.080 --> 01:50:46.840]   I'm going to put it on top of this.
[01:50:46.840 --> 01:50:50.880]   And being able to randomly pull together-- not randomly, but really have full control over
[01:50:50.880 --> 01:50:52.320]   how you pull these textures together.
[01:50:52.320 --> 01:50:56.600]   I'm going to take this part out of this and put it into here and combine these into another
[01:50:56.600 --> 01:50:57.600]   node.
[01:50:57.600 --> 01:51:00.840]   And node-compositing is something we've done for years, but node-level texture maps have
[01:51:00.840 --> 01:51:03.440]   been available but not available on Cinema 4D.
[01:51:03.440 --> 01:51:05.560]   And so not available to me.
[01:51:05.560 --> 01:51:09.880]   So anyway, it is incredibly powerful.
[01:51:09.880 --> 01:51:14.880]   They've also-- we do a lot of stuff where we import CAD drawings.
[01:51:14.880 --> 01:51:20.640]   So we actually oftentimes start with laser scans or LIDAR, which we talked about on screen
[01:51:20.640 --> 01:51:21.960]   savers at one point.
[01:51:21.960 --> 01:51:23.480]   Those become CAD drawings.
[01:51:23.480 --> 01:51:27.400]   And then trying to get them into cinema to render them has been a little bit of a lift.
[01:51:27.400 --> 01:51:28.400]   And that's gone away.
[01:51:28.400 --> 01:51:31.640]   And then the other big thing that I'm-- there's a lot of better rendering.
[01:51:31.640 --> 01:51:34.560]   Another thing that they've done really well-- and again, these are things that I'm probably
[01:51:34.560 --> 01:51:38.280]   more interested than anybody else is the motion tracking has gotten a lot better.
[01:51:38.280 --> 01:51:39.880]   Now, I remember-- I'm old enough.
[01:51:39.880 --> 01:51:43.320]   I've been doing this long enough to remember when motion tracking was something that was
[01:51:43.320 --> 01:51:47.560]   done by a person by hand.
[01:51:47.560 --> 01:51:49.800]   When I worked on Star Wars, that's what was done.
[01:51:49.800 --> 01:51:52.400]   People actually looked at the camera move and they tried to figure it all out.
[01:51:52.400 --> 01:51:53.400]   Wow.
[01:51:53.400 --> 01:52:00.040]   $10,000 a copy to have a piece of software do it for you that did pretty well.
[01:52:00.040 --> 01:52:06.160]   The idea that now it is easy to use and just sitting in your 3D app and it will-- it will
[01:52:06.160 --> 01:52:09.960]   track the-- it'll do the match moving for you.
[01:52:09.960 --> 01:52:12.480]   It will let you do what's called screen reconstruction.
[01:52:12.480 --> 01:52:15.880]   So it takes all the points that it used to do the tracking to build a 3D model that you
[01:52:15.880 --> 01:52:19.760]   can have 3D stuff interact with.
[01:52:19.760 --> 01:52:24.400]   They had all that working, but it was a little bit of a lift to use it.
[01:52:24.400 --> 01:52:28.480]   What they really spent a lot of time doing is making it a lot easier to use, which is
[01:52:28.480 --> 01:52:30.120]   what's something that's Cinema 4D.
[01:52:30.120 --> 01:52:35.080]   Basically, if you're doing 3D, the reason that we use Cinema 4D a lot is because we can
[01:52:35.080 --> 01:52:36.320]   ramp new artists up.
[01:52:36.320 --> 01:52:38.760]   It's not that-- you can ramp new artists up very fast.
[01:52:38.760 --> 01:52:42.040]   And so if you're trying to learn something, it's worth downloading the demo, playing with
[01:52:42.040 --> 01:52:43.320]   it, doing some of the tutorials.
[01:52:43.320 --> 01:52:46.640]   The lynda.com stuff, actually, is really good.
[01:52:46.640 --> 01:52:53.840]   And there's a guy named EJ Hosenfrost, who does a lot of great tutorials on how to use
[01:52:53.840 --> 01:52:54.840]   it.
[01:52:54.840 --> 01:52:57.200]   So anyway, that's my Cinema 4D worth checking out.
[01:52:57.200 --> 01:53:00.120]   It's always worth just downloading and playing with the demo, even if you don't know if you're
[01:53:00.120 --> 01:53:03.200]   going to do 3D, just because it's fun.
[01:53:03.200 --> 01:53:04.400]   It's 3D.
[01:53:04.400 --> 01:53:06.400]   It's easy.
[01:53:06.400 --> 01:53:13.400]   Microsoft has unveiled the Surface Pro 6 in matte black quad core and the Surface Book
[01:53:13.400 --> 01:53:16.320]   2 also in matte black.
[01:53:16.320 --> 01:53:21.760]   And now, Andy Hocko from WGBH in Boston.
[01:53:21.760 --> 01:53:28.240]   Yes, my pick is one of those-- it's something that I was just announced today.
[01:53:28.240 --> 01:53:29.240]   So obviously, I haven't tried it.
[01:53:29.240 --> 01:53:30.680]   It's new on Indiegogo.
[01:53:30.680 --> 01:53:36.120]   But it's a sequel to what it was an interesting, but I think kind of not quite their writing
[01:53:36.120 --> 01:53:37.120]   tool.
[01:53:37.120 --> 01:53:40.760]   It's called the Traveler from the folks at Freerite.
[01:53:40.760 --> 01:53:45.400]   It is a word processor, meaning that it is a keyboard.
[01:53:45.400 --> 01:53:49.600]   It is a screen and software for editing text.
[01:53:49.600 --> 01:53:51.080]   It has Wi-Fi.
[01:53:51.080 --> 01:53:55.360]   But all you can do with a Wi-Fi is automatically sync the stuff you've written to your Dropbox
[01:53:55.360 --> 01:53:58.080]   or Google Drive or whatever account.
[01:53:58.080 --> 01:54:01.360]   It says no web browser, not even a micro browser.
[01:54:01.360 --> 01:54:04.640]   I'm not even sure if it has spell check.
[01:54:04.640 --> 01:54:10.880]   The idea of this is that it is optimized to be a writing word processor tool.
[01:54:10.880 --> 01:54:16.480]   So to that end, it has a really nice 2 millimeter throw keyboard.
[01:54:16.480 --> 01:54:22.080]   It has a two to four weeks of battery life, they promise, because it uses e-ink displays
[01:54:22.080 --> 01:54:24.640]   instead of LCD or OLED.
[01:54:24.640 --> 01:54:26.560]   And I've used the predecessor to it.
[01:54:26.560 --> 01:54:30.800]   It's actually really, really cool to write on an e-ink display.
[01:54:30.800 --> 01:54:32.480]   It's like the display on your Kindle.
[01:54:32.480 --> 01:54:35.200]   It really does feel like you're just typing.
[01:54:35.200 --> 01:54:40.680]   What I like about this is that they seem to have learned a lot of lessons from the first
[01:54:40.680 --> 01:54:41.680]   one.
[01:54:41.680 --> 01:54:46.280]   The first one was kind of cute and kind of a dope.
[01:54:46.280 --> 01:54:52.360]   You feel as though as a prejudiced, bigoted person, full of failures, personal failures
[01:54:52.360 --> 01:54:53.360]   myself.
[01:54:53.360 --> 01:54:56.680]   There's a comment about me, not about people who bought the original one.
[01:54:56.680 --> 01:55:02.360]   I imagine that people who bought it spent more time talking about why they think this
[01:55:02.360 --> 01:55:03.360]   is the best way.
[01:55:03.360 --> 01:55:04.920]   No, because I don't like Facebook.
[01:55:04.920 --> 01:55:06.320]   I don't need the Facebook.
[01:55:06.320 --> 01:55:11.360]   It was very, very ostentatious and showy, and it didn't have some features I think were
[01:55:11.360 --> 01:55:13.640]   really, really good for writers to have.
[01:55:13.640 --> 01:55:20.240]   This one is, instead of being like a manual, the size and weight of a compact manual typewriter,
[01:55:20.240 --> 01:55:24.240]   it really is a keyboard and a screen that folds down on top of that keyboard.
[01:55:24.240 --> 01:55:26.840]   It's even smaller than a laptop.
[01:55:26.840 --> 01:55:31.440]   The has extra editing features that make it easy.
[01:55:31.440 --> 01:55:35.520]   It works more like a regular text editor than as something that aggressively doesn't
[01:55:35.520 --> 01:55:37.400]   want you to go back and edit things.
[01:55:37.400 --> 01:55:39.880]   It's easy to have multiple projects going at the same time.
[01:55:39.880 --> 01:55:44.600]   The whole idea of this is just that if you feel as though this is your jam, if you feel
[01:55:44.600 --> 01:55:53.120]   as though $300 to $500 for a device that only does word processing, but it will allow you
[01:55:53.120 --> 01:55:58.080]   to never have it, never be stuck with a bad battery, never be stuck with a .5 millimeter
[01:55:58.080 --> 01:56:01.160]   key travel keyboard, never have any distractions.
[01:56:01.160 --> 01:56:03.480]   You can just go someplace and do it.
[01:56:03.480 --> 01:56:04.480]   It's an interesting idea.
[01:56:04.480 --> 01:56:06.280]   I haven't pre-ordered yet.
[01:56:06.280 --> 01:56:11.320]   They actually made triple their $50,000 fundraising goal today and they just started
[01:56:11.320 --> 01:56:12.320]   launch today.
[01:56:12.320 --> 01:56:14.080]   If you get an early, it's about $300.
[01:56:14.080 --> 01:56:20.200]   They say it's going to be $600 when they actually ship in June of 2019.
[01:56:20.200 --> 01:56:25.240]   I don't think I can see $600 for this, but for $300 for a professional writer or someone
[01:56:25.240 --> 01:56:30.520]   who's writing a novel or has a specific project that they want to keep separate mentally from
[01:56:30.520 --> 01:56:34.240]   the tools they use for all of their other computing that involves a keyboard.
[01:56:34.240 --> 01:56:36.240]   That's very, very interesting.
[01:56:36.240 --> 01:56:38.040]   It's at least worth looking at.
[01:56:38.040 --> 01:56:40.520]   If nothing else, I love the story that's being told of.
[01:56:40.520 --> 01:56:45.560]   We made this one thing that was niche and out of our own heads.
[01:56:45.560 --> 01:56:49.560]   This is the second version of that we built after the first one was successful enough
[01:56:49.560 --> 01:56:54.840]   to acquire a bunch of fans who were giving us feedback on what they didn't like and what
[01:56:54.840 --> 01:56:56.840]   they wanted to see in the next version.
[01:56:56.840 --> 01:56:57.840]   Interesting.
[01:56:57.840 --> 01:57:00.880]   Not out in time for nano-Rimo, I'm sorry to say.
[01:57:00.880 --> 01:57:01.880]   No.
[01:57:01.880 --> 01:57:04.880]   That's interesting.
[01:57:04.880 --> 01:57:12.240]   I usually am like, "App, I lose chest hair out of nerves when there's a crowdfunding campaign
[01:57:12.240 --> 01:57:16.680]   for something that involves building a piece of technology."
[01:57:16.680 --> 01:57:20.480]   But this company, they've already been through this show once.
[01:57:20.480 --> 01:57:25.120]   They've shipped the original free writer and worked just fine.
[01:57:25.120 --> 01:57:27.680]   So I don't have any doubt that you'll get it in 2019.
[01:57:27.680 --> 01:57:31.520]   Maybe not necessarily in June of 2019 because who knows what happens, but you're not going
[01:57:31.520 --> 01:57:35.600]   to be waiting three years later for your device to arrive.
[01:57:35.600 --> 01:57:40.160]   Yeah, well, interesting.
[01:57:40.160 --> 01:57:41.160]   I want to correct myself.
[01:57:41.160 --> 01:57:42.160]   It wasn't a Surface Book.
[01:57:42.160 --> 01:57:46.440]   It's a Surface laptop too that Microsoft has announced.
[01:57:46.440 --> 01:57:51.200]   Thanks to Paul Thorett, we do have some information about the matte black devices.
[01:57:51.200 --> 01:57:57.680]   They will be available October 16th, starting price for Surface Pro 6, $899, starting
[01:57:57.680 --> 01:58:02.480]   price for Surface Laptop 2, which Microsoft says is twice as fast and has 14 and a half
[01:58:02.480 --> 01:58:08.800]   hours of battery life, $9.99, $15 and $1 contrast ratio too.
[01:58:08.800 --> 01:58:10.080]   So that might be a good...
[01:58:10.080 --> 01:58:12.280]   That actually might be a very good writing.
[01:58:12.280 --> 01:58:13.520]   All you need is matte black.
[01:58:13.520 --> 01:58:14.520]   I mean, let's be honest now.
[01:58:14.520 --> 01:58:16.520]   Once they said matte black, the rest is really relevant.
[01:58:16.520 --> 01:58:18.160]   I do think it is kind of amazing.
[01:58:18.160 --> 01:58:20.320]   The phone crosses past the tablet.
[01:58:20.320 --> 01:58:21.320]   Yeah.
[01:58:21.320 --> 01:58:22.320]   You know, right.
[01:58:22.320 --> 01:58:24.160]   I'm in that boat.
[01:58:24.160 --> 01:58:27.680]   I had budgeted money for...I haven't bought a new phone in three years.
[01:58:27.680 --> 01:58:32.960]   I bought a refurb pixel phone I think last summer or the summer before.
[01:58:32.960 --> 01:58:37.200]   And so I had set aside like $700 or $100 of my budget that I'm probably going to buy
[01:58:37.200 --> 01:58:39.520]   just to see whatever's new.
[01:58:39.520 --> 01:58:43.560]   And now I'm like, I'm kind of more exciting about the tablets that might be coming out
[01:58:43.560 --> 01:58:45.520]   from Apple or Google.
[01:58:45.520 --> 01:58:46.920]   And I'm like, I'd much rather hold on.
[01:58:46.920 --> 01:58:48.240]   I still love this old phone.
[01:58:48.240 --> 01:58:53.800]   I'd much rather keep it for year three or year four and add a really cool chrome tablet
[01:58:53.800 --> 01:58:57.600]   or add the latest version of the iPad Pro to my lineup.
[01:58:57.600 --> 01:59:01.520]   Because...and I hope I might even save some money on the deal because that's where phones
[01:59:01.520 --> 01:59:04.280]   are going these days.
[01:59:04.280 --> 01:59:07.560]   Well, thank you everybody for being here.
[01:59:07.560 --> 01:59:09.480]   I think we should wrap this puppy up.
[01:59:09.480 --> 01:59:11.040]   Leave something for next week.
[01:59:11.040 --> 01:59:15.440]   Renee Richie is at imore.com up there in Montreal, home of the bagel.
[01:59:15.440 --> 01:59:16.440]   Yes, sir.
[01:59:16.440 --> 01:59:22.080]   You can read all his works, including his coverage of Pokemon Co.
[01:59:22.080 --> 01:59:26.520]   As well as his fabulous vector podcast at imore.com.
[01:59:26.520 --> 01:59:28.920]   What's coming up on I on Vectors?
[01:59:28.920 --> 01:59:30.200]   I've been trying to do a video a day.
[01:59:30.200 --> 01:59:32.560]   I haven't quite made it, but I'm working my way towards it.
[01:59:32.560 --> 01:59:34.560]   So I had to hold...I did a whole beauty gate thing.
[01:59:34.560 --> 01:59:37.400]   I'd like to talk to Sebastian, his mother smart people and did a whole beauty gate video
[01:59:37.400 --> 01:59:38.400]   today.
[01:59:38.400 --> 01:59:39.400]   Very nice.
[01:59:39.400 --> 01:59:40.400]   Yeah.
[01:59:40.400 --> 01:59:44.520]   Alex Lindsey, you find him at the Pixel Core easiest way to follow him is on the Twitter
[01:59:44.520 --> 01:59:45.640]   @alexlndsay.
[01:59:45.640 --> 01:59:46.640]   After a sabbatical.
[01:59:46.640 --> 01:59:53.240]   I started doing the tear downs again.
[01:59:53.240 --> 01:59:56.080]   So if you want to see me complain about other people's work.
[01:59:56.080 --> 01:59:57.080]   Yay!
[01:59:57.080 --> 01:59:58.880]   A new tear down.
[01:59:58.880 --> 02:00:04.400]   So the tear down is basically me looking at other people's work, oftentimes broadcast,
[02:00:04.400 --> 02:00:10.320]   and either giving you the what's missing or also giving you some inside baseball about
[02:00:10.320 --> 02:00:14.080]   why they're doing what they're doing and kind of the whole thought process.
[02:00:14.080 --> 02:00:17.640]   I mean, we've had an opportunity to do a lot of work with a lot of broadcasters.
[02:00:17.640 --> 02:00:23.040]   And obviously you'll notice from the shows that I have a strong opinion about what works
[02:00:23.040 --> 02:00:24.640]   and how does it work.
[02:00:24.640 --> 02:00:25.640]   So I'm not making...
[02:00:25.640 --> 02:00:28.080]   Give this man a tell us later and stand back.
[02:00:28.080 --> 02:00:29.080]   Yeah.
[02:00:29.080 --> 02:00:32.480]   Well, notice that a lot of these people here on CNN are white dudes.
[02:00:32.480 --> 02:00:33.480]   Yeah, yeah.
[02:00:33.480 --> 02:00:34.480]   I don't get into the content.
[02:00:34.480 --> 02:00:36.720]   I don't get into the content part of it.
[02:00:36.720 --> 02:00:37.720]   I just get into the...
[02:00:37.720 --> 02:00:38.720]   That's more of the introduction.
[02:00:38.720 --> 02:00:39.720]   Yeah.
[02:00:39.720 --> 02:00:40.720]   Like what's wrong with this shot?
[02:00:40.720 --> 02:00:41.720]   Yeah.
[02:00:41.720 --> 02:00:43.440]   I was just talking about the fact that I don't like windows behind people and you know...
[02:00:43.440 --> 02:00:47.680]   Actually John Kerry, because it emphasizes the inverse curvature of his job.
[02:00:47.680 --> 02:00:49.440]   Well, in a white shirt in front of the...
[02:00:49.440 --> 02:00:51.040]   And then also I got the buttons.
[02:00:51.040 --> 02:00:54.160]   Actually, given the lighting problems, they've done a pretty good job with that shot.
[02:00:54.160 --> 02:00:55.160]   Yeah.
[02:00:55.160 --> 02:00:56.160]   Yeah.
[02:00:56.160 --> 02:00:57.160]   So the...
[02:00:57.160 --> 02:00:58.720]   Anyway, so I go...
[02:00:58.720 --> 02:01:00.080]   I break down a lot of stuff.
[02:01:00.080 --> 02:01:03.360]   I'm kind of moving slowly towards using it as an educational resource as well.
[02:01:03.360 --> 02:01:08.400]   So I'm going to do more where I talk about what would make better and start to mix in
[02:01:08.400 --> 02:01:09.400]   some other bits and pieces.
[02:01:09.400 --> 02:01:13.280]   So if anyway, if you like that kind of thing or you got five minutes to burn, there you
[02:01:13.280 --> 02:01:14.280]   go.
[02:01:14.280 --> 02:01:23.440]   And Enocho, catch him at WGBH in Boston, public radio for Boston and on his website, IHNAITKO.com.
[02:01:23.440 --> 02:01:25.640]   Follow him on Flickr, always great images.
[02:01:25.640 --> 02:01:30.200]   Did you post the image that you're going to be showing?
[02:01:30.200 --> 02:01:37.080]   No, I'll probably post it after the gallery is hanged.
[02:01:37.080 --> 02:01:41.760]   I'm not saying that I just snapped this thing with an iPhone 10 and printed it out on a
[02:01:41.760 --> 02:01:42.920]   dot matrix printer.
[02:01:42.920 --> 02:01:47.560]   It did get a lot of Photoshop Google food, but that's what you do when you...
[02:01:47.560 --> 02:01:50.600]   But that's what you do when you want to do an already sort of print.
[02:01:50.600 --> 02:01:51.600]   It's never...
[02:01:51.600 --> 02:01:52.920]   But yeah, I'll post it.
[02:01:52.920 --> 02:01:57.040]   I'm hoping to write up the whole story because it was...
[02:01:57.040 --> 02:02:02.040]   It teaches you a lot about what an iPhone camera can do and what you can do with the
[02:02:02.040 --> 02:02:03.440]   pictures that are taken with it.
[02:02:03.440 --> 02:02:04.600]   Excellent.
[02:02:04.600 --> 02:02:08.960]   We do Mac Break Weekly every Tuesday, right after iOS today, usually around 11 a.m. Pacific
[02:02:08.960 --> 02:02:11.280]   to be an Eastern 1800 UTC.
[02:02:11.280 --> 02:02:14.640]   If you want to join us in studio, email tickets@twit.tv.
[02:02:14.640 --> 02:02:16.920]   There's no cost, but we'll put a chair out for you.
[02:02:16.920 --> 02:02:20.240]   You got to be, of course, in the Petaluma, Northern California area.
[02:02:20.240 --> 02:02:24.480]   You can also watch the live stream anywhere in the world at Twit.tv/live.
[02:02:24.480 --> 02:02:28.160]   If you do that, join us in the chatroom where people of similar...
[02:02:28.160 --> 02:02:34.560]   Of a similar bent are watching at the same time, IRC.twit.tv.
[02:02:34.560 --> 02:02:38.800]   I'm not saying the chatroom's bent, or am I?
[02:02:38.800 --> 02:02:43.520]   If you can't watch live or be here live, you can always get on-demand versions, audio
[02:02:43.520 --> 02:02:47.240]   and video of everything we do on the network at Twit.tv.
[02:02:47.240 --> 02:02:49.680]   In this case, Twit.tv/MBW.
[02:02:49.680 --> 02:02:54.400]   Best thing to do, be subscribe in your favorite podcast application.
[02:02:54.400 --> 02:02:56.480]   That way you'll get it absolutely automatically.
[02:02:56.480 --> 02:02:58.760]   The minute it's available.
[02:02:58.760 --> 02:02:59.760]   Thanks for joining us.
[02:02:59.760 --> 02:03:00.760]   We'll see you next time now.
[02:03:00.760 --> 02:03:01.760]   Back to Work Cause Break Time.
[02:03:01.760 --> 02:03:02.760]   It's over.
[02:03:02.760 --> 02:03:02.760]   Bye-bye.
[02:03:02.760 --> 02:03:03.480]   He's over.
[02:03:03.480 --> 02:03:04.500]   Oh, bye.
[02:03:04.500 --> 02:03:14.500]   [MUSIC]
