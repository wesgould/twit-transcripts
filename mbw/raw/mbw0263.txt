[00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:19.120]   Alex Lindsey's back.
[00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:20.560]   Welcome from the Pixel Corp.
[00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:21.060]   Thank you.
[00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:22.160]   You were at Dreamforce last week.
[00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:23.280]   That's been crazy.
[00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:24.560]   Oh, yeah.
[00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:25.520]   It was pretty insane.
[00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:28.000]   It was actually-- the viewing had jumped a lot, too.
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.360]   It was about 10,000-- almost 10,000 people watching most
[00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:30.800]   of the time.
[00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:34.960]   Dreamforce is a big conference that for sales force users,
[00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:37.000]   is it sponsored by Salesforce?
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.440]   It's basically run by Salesforce.
[00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:39.280]   It's their conference.
[00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:41.840]   It's as if Macworld was actually run by Apple.
[00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:43.240]   But they have vendors there.
[00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:44.360]   And of course, they had keynotes.
[00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:47.440]   And they had a great conversation on business with Eric Schmidt
[00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:47.960]   and--
[00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:49.280]   Oh, how fun.
[00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:51.280]   And that would have been very interesting.
[00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:53.760]   It was-- yeah, it was-- it actually turned out
[00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:55.040]   to be a great, great interview.
[00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:55.840]   It's up on YouTube now.
[00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:56.340]   Cool.
[00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:57.160]   It was fun.
[00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:57.800]   Well, welcome back.
[00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:58.560]   We missed you.
[00:01:58.560 --> 00:01:59.080]   We missed you.
[00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:00.200]   It's going to be bad.
[00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:03.800]   But Mr. Adidako is also here, recovered now from the hurricane.
[00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:06.800]   He's got frozen pies in the freezer.
[00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:08.800]   And he's back on track.
[00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:11.880]   Yeah, it was fun because the first day--
[00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:14.880]   I just got my power back on 48 hours ago.
[00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:15.800]   And so my--
[00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:17.560]   Wow, you're kidding.
[00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:18.800]   I'm not kidding.
[00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:20.280]   That's the problem with power.
[00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:23.160]   It's just sometimes it's not just the things that
[00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:25.440]   happen at the substation.
[00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:27.440]   There's a stress to failure sort of thing that happens.
[00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:29.720]   So if you find out that, oh, I guess
[00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:31.240]   the transformer at the end of our street
[00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:34.080]   was probably going to go bad sometime in the next two years.
[00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:37.000]   It was the-- when the power came back on experimentally
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   three days ago and it blew.
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.440]   Yeah, that was the big cue.
[00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:44.760]   So spewing PCBs all over the street, no doubt.
[00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:46.520]   But hey, I don't live in that end.
[00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:47.840]   So it's OK.
[00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:50.080]   Well, geez, that's a week that Irene knocked you out.
[00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:51.080]   Well, I'm glad you're back.
[00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:52.240]   I really am.
[00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:52.760]   Yeah.
[00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:54.560]   Electricity is a good-- see, you're
[00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:58.760]   supposed to-- if I were a more perfect specimen,
[00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:00.040]   I would be now saying, you know what?
[00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:01.680]   It just taught me that sometimes--
[00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:02.160]   I learned.
[00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:04.000]   It's good to simplify.
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.400]   I just can't do time.
[00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:06.440]   Get to know myself.
[00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:07.600]   It's a better one.
[00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:08.960]   I'll screw you.
[00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:09.360]   I want--
[00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:09.360]   I want--
[00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:09.360]   I want--
[00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:14.080]   I want frozen pizzas that go into an electric oven
[00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:15.960]   and become delicious hot pizza.
[00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:17.720]   That's what I want.
[00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:20.520]   We would-- I mean, this whole enterprise,
[00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:22.520]   not merely the studio, which we now
[00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:24.240]   have a $3,000 a month power bill,
[00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:28.240]   but just from here to you at home,
[00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:29.960]   you need electricity at every step of the way.
[00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:30.520]   You shut us down.
[00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:31.320]   We'd be out of business.
[00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:32.240]   I'd have to be a preacher.
[00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:33.600]   I will have to say, though, in some of my travels,
[00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:34.880]   in some of the countries I've been in,
[00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:38.480]   where the power is less than stable.
[00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:39.400]   Yeah.
[00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:42.920]   I do-- I did get kind of into the pattern
[00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:43.680]   of the--
[00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:45.040]   Well, it's to reinvent yourself.
[00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:45.800]   Well, it was kind of nice.
[00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:47.680]   It was like, well, there's nothing to do here, but have tea.
[00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:49.080]   You know what it was-- and I actually--
[00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:50.600]   I really enjoyed it a lot.
[00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:53.640]   This is a question, then we'll get to the news.
[00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:55.240]   There's plenty to talk about.
[00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:55.920]   You know me.
[00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:57.400]   I'm Mr. Rathol.
[00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:59.440]   Absent Merlin, man, I have to do it.
[00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:01.280]   By the way, Merlin was on Twitter a couple weeks ago.
[00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:01.560]   Great.
[00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:02.640]   It was great to have him back, so I
[00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:05.000]   hope we can get him back on Mac break weekly soon.
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:10.080]   If there were no technology, no video, no electricity,
[00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:11.720]   what would you-- you think what would you
[00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:14.480]   be doing for a living, Alex?
[00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:17.480]   I think I would be-- I think that I would be probably
[00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:18.640]   a stone carver.
[00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:19.640]   You liked it.
[00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:20.920]   You still would be working in 3D.
[00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:22.680]   I still be modeling in 3D.
[00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:24.400]   I just wouldn't have a computer or electricity.
[00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:26.280]   It's more work, but you'd get it done.
[00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:27.520]   It's really hard work.
[00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:29.760]   I have to admit I've tried it, and it would take me a long time
[00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:30.680]   to get good at it.
[00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:33.040]   I've tried a little bit of it, and it's very hard work.
[00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:34.160]   You were doing-- I remember you told me
[00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:36.280]   that one of the reasons you went to Africa to do training
[00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:39.240]   is that there are people who are stone carvers who
[00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:42.160]   think and work in 3D, and it was your kind of thesis
[00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:44.720]   that these people would make excellent 3D artists on--
[00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:45.240]   It was true.
[00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:47.160]   And we've had some test trainings.
[00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:48.360]   We haven't really dug into it as these.
[00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:48.920]   It's a really nice idea.
[00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:51.240]   But the idea is to taking someone's skill set
[00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:52.800]   and moving it only about 10%.
[00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:54.680]   So we're not retraining them in a completely different thing.
[00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:56.840]   You already have people who have incredible visions
[00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:01.400]   of how to take something very raw and make it beautiful.
[00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:03.800]   And the reality is the computer tools nowadays
[00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:05.880]   are oftentimes easier than the stone ones.
[00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:07.360]   Sure.
[00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:09.760]   Ten-sore guy says, if there were an electricity,
[00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:13.080]   his job would be inventing electricity.
[00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:14.800]   And Zillifan in our chat room says,
[00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:18.040]   this is a new feature onto it, post-apocalyptic job hunt.
[00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:22.000]   In the post-apocalypse, Andy Inako, what would you be?
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.040]   I'd probably be breaking into people's houses
[00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:28.000]   and stealing stuff because I figured that with no electricity,
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:29.680]   that's the security system down.
[00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:30.880]   People are dark anyway.
[00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:33.080]   So as long as you're responsibly quiet,
[00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:36.480]   you can probably get at the water, any livestock.
[00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:37.360]   That's for stuff.
[00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:39.520]   It really will be a golden age for the thing.
[00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:41.440]   For burglars.
[00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:44.600]   I mean, for those of us who missed the first dot-com boom,
[00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:48.640]   it's like getting it back on the clock for the next big.
[00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:52.080]   I'm just thinking, I think I would be a preacher.
[00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:52.920]   I don't know.
[00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:54.840]   I just think that that's kind of what we do anyway, right?
[00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:55.840]   Yes.
[00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:57.680]   All it has I have foretold.
[00:05:57.680 --> 00:05:59.960]   The dark age that I've--
[00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:00.960]   Exactly.
[00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:02.160]   --I am the Cassandra of Technology.
[00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:02.680]   Exactly.
[00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:04.560]   I've read my message, but no one listens.
[00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:06.360]   I'd either be a preacher or an actor.
[00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:07.200]   Then say which.
[00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:08.040]   Much the same thing.
[00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:09.520]   In a stage with no lights.
[00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:11.600]   Well, you know, they could-- or somebody said--
[00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:13.960]   Trucke says, I'd be a flim-flam man.
[00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:15.120]   I might.
[00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:17.480]   It's not a bad job either.
[00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:18.920]   Well, OK, let's talk about the news.
[00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:22.040]   And of course, the big story of last week--
[00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:24.760]   and unfortunately, it happened right after Mac break weekly,
[00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:26.240]   so a couple of days later.
[00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:28.400]   So we're kind of last in line to cover it.
[00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:31.560]   But I think we should, because I think it's relevant to iPhones
[00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:33.200]   anyway--
[00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:35.000]   the Department of Justice has said
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:40.840]   we are going to sue to block AT&T's $39 billion acquisition
[00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:42.720]   of T-Mobile.
[00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:44.280]   That's good, isn't it?
[00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:46.600]   I think that what we need to get out of this at least
[00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:47.960]   is a lot of restrictions.
[00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:50.280]   If not, you know, it can't just pass right through.
[00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:51.320]   There just aren't enough players.
[00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:53.120]   They do say that the judge involved
[00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:55.840]   is not a rubber stamp judge that sometimes she has,
[00:06:55.840 --> 00:06:57.360]   in fact, turned the government down.
[00:06:57.360 --> 00:07:03.400]   Most recently, in 2001, in the merger of two security companies,
[00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:06.360]   Sun Guard and Comdisco, I think.
[00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:08.920]   And she said that the barrier to entry
[00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:11.480]   into this business was so low that there's no need
[00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:13.640]   to worry about shrinking the market.
[00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:15.640]   You can't say that about the wireless industry.
[00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:16.140]   All right.
[00:07:16.140 --> 00:07:17.560]   Nobody's going to come along and say, yeah,
[00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:19.240]   I'd like to be Leo's phone company.
[00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:22.400]   And if we look at how AT&T treats a lot of folks that
[00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:24.600]   are connected-- like Sonic is a good example.
[00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:25.760]   We have Sonic here.
[00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:28.040]   This is a small-- well, not that small,
[00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:30.080]   but medium-sized internet service provider, yeah.
[00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:30.600]   Right.
[00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:34.320]   And the big delays when we want to install something,
[00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:36.360]   fix something, work with something, is AT&T.
[00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:37.600]   Well, they stretch--
[00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:40.120]   they're required by the FCC to cooperate, but only just--
[00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:42.560]   so they bend it as far as they can,
[00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:43.520]   before they get in trouble.
[00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:45.040]   And that leaves us with--
[00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:47.560]   I mean, I think that that's what would happen in the--
[00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:50.200]   I think that that stuff would have to be tightened
[00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:52.600]   to among a lot of other things to make the possible.
[00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:54.400]   Sprint has now joined the suit and says,
[00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:55.240]   we don't want it either.
[00:07:55.240 --> 00:07:58.360]   And of course, Sprint would be the real loser
[00:07:58.360 --> 00:08:00.040]   in an AT&T mobile acquisition.
[00:08:00.040 --> 00:08:02.960]   It would make AT&T mobile the biggest by far cell phone
[00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:05.640]   company, then there's Verizon, and then way
[00:08:05.640 --> 00:08:07.040]   in the back of the pack.
[00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:08.760]   I think you can kill Sprint.
[00:08:08.760 --> 00:08:11.240]   In fact, I think that's probably one of the reasons
[00:08:11.240 --> 00:08:13.720]   to do this is because, yeah, there's three,
[00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:14.760]   and you can say reasonably.
[00:08:14.760 --> 00:08:15.960]   Well, they're still competition.
[00:08:15.960 --> 00:08:17.360]   But Sprint's so small that they're
[00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:18.760]   going to be snapped up at some point.
[00:08:18.760 --> 00:08:20.680]   What do you think, Andy?
[00:08:20.680 --> 00:08:21.640]   I'm not sure.
[00:08:21.640 --> 00:08:24.040]   I've always seen pluses and minuses to--
[00:08:24.040 --> 00:08:26.480]   TMO will become part of AT&T in the sense
[00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:30.160]   that you're going to be adding so many more cell antennas
[00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:31.760]   to an existing network.
[00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:35.720]   And I'm borrowing the existence of a specific model
[00:08:35.720 --> 00:08:37.960]   phone that's only available on Sprint or T-Mobile.
[00:08:37.960 --> 00:08:40.640]   I can't remember the last time that I recommended someone
[00:08:40.640 --> 00:08:43.520]   go with a carrier other than Verizon or AT&T.
[00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:44.480]   Yeah.
[00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:46.520]   Well, and that's partly the iPhone's fault, isn't it?
[00:08:46.520 --> 00:08:49.440]   I mean, some of this we can say is Apple's doing.
[00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:50.840]   Not only that.
[00:08:50.840 --> 00:08:52.640]   It really is all about speed and coverage.
[00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:57.160]   And Verizon and AT&T really have both those categories knocked.
[00:08:57.160 --> 00:09:01.760]   I am in the pleasant position of often traveling
[00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:03.400]   with two or three different phones to them
[00:09:03.400 --> 00:09:05.040]   that I'm just evaluating.
[00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:07.440]   And man, it's-- we're asked, I will always
[00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:12.240]   get really great 4G numbers, even 3G numbers, on AT&T and Verizon
[00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:14.760]   if I've got a T-Mobile phone in my pocket.
[00:09:14.760 --> 00:09:16.880]   If I'm walking out, great.
[00:09:16.880 --> 00:09:18.560]   I got great coverage there.
[00:09:18.560 --> 00:09:20.480]   The lesser carrier coverage tends
[00:09:20.480 --> 00:09:22.040]   to be a little bit better, believe it or not,
[00:09:22.040 --> 00:09:24.000]   in bigger cities than in the smaller cities.
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:27.000]   But if I'm someplace in Western Massachusetts,
[00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:32.640]   if I'm in a city that dares to be one of the top 20 cities
[00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:34.960]   in the country instead of the top five cities
[00:09:34.960 --> 00:09:37.480]   in the country, things get a little bit dodgier.
[00:09:37.480 --> 00:09:40.160]   In principle, I do think that having more companies
[00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:42.120]   and more choices better for consumers.
[00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:44.800]   But I do have to be honest to say that when
[00:09:44.800 --> 00:09:46.720]   was the last time you recommended someone
[00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:48.800]   give a sprint or T-Mobile a chance?
[00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:50.400]   Yeah.
[00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:53.920]   Somebody squint in our chat room says he wants AT&T and T-Mobile
[00:09:53.920 --> 00:09:54.360]   to merge.
[00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:57.480]   I want you to tell me why you think it's a good thing.
[00:09:57.480 --> 00:09:57.920]   Squint.
[00:09:57.920 --> 00:10:00.800]   And then somebody is saying, well,
[00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:04.320]   maybe Apple could come in as a white knight.
[00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:07.920]   Actually, no, because it's $39 billion.
[00:10:07.920 --> 00:10:08.840]   That's more than Apple.
[00:10:08.840 --> 00:10:10.840]   That's just right where Apple's cash reserves are.
[00:10:10.840 --> 00:10:11.800]   They've got twice that much.
[00:10:11.800 --> 00:10:12.720]   They have more than that?
[00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:13.840]   They could buy it with cash.
[00:10:13.840 --> 00:10:14.800]   They would have 70,000.
[00:10:14.800 --> 00:10:16.600]   They would have said here.
[00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:19.600]   And we'll still have $30 billion left.
[00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:23.040]   Now, I don't think it would be the same problem
[00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:25.440]   for the DOJ if Apple bought it.
[00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:26.120]   Well, it might be--
[00:10:26.120 --> 00:10:27.000]   I don't think Apple wants it.
[00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:31.200]   I think Apple starts marching towards a antitrust issue.
[00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:33.520]   When you start owning-- when you start owning everything
[00:10:33.520 --> 00:10:37.360]   from the hardware, the software, and the distribution--
[00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:39.240]   It would make more sense for Google to do it,
[00:10:39.240 --> 00:10:43.520]   because of course T-Mobile is where most of the Google
[00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:45.520]   experience phones, the plain vanilla Google phones,
[00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:48.560]   go, the Nexus 1, the G2X.
[00:10:48.560 --> 00:10:51.560]   I think the issue is that there's a lot of baggage
[00:10:51.560 --> 00:10:53.320]   with all of these cell companies.
[00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:55.360]   I mean, the reality is we don't know where things are going
[00:10:55.360 --> 00:10:57.760]   to go in the next 10 years and whether it really matters.
[00:10:57.760 --> 00:11:01.240]   I mean, we're moving to a data reality, not a voice reality,
[00:11:01.240 --> 00:11:02.520]   where everything's going to be data.
[00:11:02.520 --> 00:11:03.680]   And we're not going to be--
[00:11:03.680 --> 00:11:05.680]   we're making voice calls, but we're
[00:11:05.680 --> 00:11:06.600]   going to be having a data--
[00:11:06.600 --> 00:11:07.600]   Data is where it's at, isn't it?
[00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:09.400]   And so the question is, is they have all these business
[00:11:09.400 --> 00:11:11.560]   models based around voice, and they're still
[00:11:11.560 --> 00:11:12.440]   grappling with that.
[00:11:12.440 --> 00:11:15.640]   And there's no reason to buy them while they're figuring it out.
[00:11:15.640 --> 00:11:16.640]   Good point.
[00:11:16.640 --> 00:11:19.520]   Remember that survey that hit a couple weeks ago
[00:11:19.520 --> 00:11:23.120]   about the usage of Android devices versus iPhone users,
[00:11:23.120 --> 00:11:28.080]   I thought really tells a story that isn't heard that much,
[00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:31.000]   is that we live in a world of smartphones.
[00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:32.360]   We live in a world--
[00:11:32.360 --> 00:11:33.640]   three of us and most of our listeners,
[00:11:33.640 --> 00:11:36.000]   I think, live in a world where we're carrying in always
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:39.320]   on connected internet, tablet, device, and our pockets
[00:11:39.320 --> 00:11:39.960]   at all times.
[00:11:39.960 --> 00:11:41.240]   And that's the way we like to live.
[00:11:41.240 --> 00:11:43.360]   But there's still people who can't really afford
[00:11:43.360 --> 00:11:46.920]   to spend $2,000 a year on these huge humongous data
[00:11:46.920 --> 00:11:47.560]   plans.
[00:11:47.560 --> 00:11:50.640]   They really do want a phone that let them take pictures, text
[00:11:50.640 --> 00:11:53.440]   message, and actually talk to their fellow humans.
[00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:55.520]   So there really has to be carriers
[00:11:55.520 --> 00:11:57.560]   that can offer attractive packages to people
[00:11:57.560 --> 00:12:00.360]   who don't want to spend more than $20, $30 a month.
[00:12:00.360 --> 00:12:07.720]   Now maybe the solution to that is services like Virgin Air.
[00:12:07.720 --> 00:12:09.600]   And MVNOs.
[00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:11.200]   Yeah, I mean, but pays you go.
[00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:13.480]   But still, you're not getting that same sort of service,
[00:12:13.480 --> 00:12:15.520]   you're not getting that same sort of performance.
[00:12:15.520 --> 00:12:17.640]   So to say that--
[00:12:17.640 --> 00:12:20.280]   I do agree with you that data is always--
[00:12:20.280 --> 00:12:21.920]   the importance of data over voice
[00:12:21.920 --> 00:12:24.280]   is going to just keep getting bigger and bigger.
[00:12:24.280 --> 00:12:26.440]   But I don't think that's going to be a predominating factor
[00:12:26.440 --> 00:12:27.880]   for at least another three or four years.
[00:12:27.880 --> 00:12:29.560]   We still have to deal with people who just want
[00:12:29.560 --> 00:12:31.760]   a text message and just want to spend $50 a year.
[00:12:31.760 --> 00:12:33.760]   Well, are these people after?
[00:12:33.760 --> 00:12:38.000]   We had to say text messaging is becoming data, really.
[00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:41.480]   I mean, SMS, which is kind of a weird form of text messaging,
[00:12:41.480 --> 00:12:42.640]   the original form of text messaging
[00:12:42.640 --> 00:12:44.360]   is being replaced by a group messaging
[00:12:44.360 --> 00:12:47.480]   through iMessenger, Apple's iMessenger, Blackberry Messenger,
[00:12:47.480 --> 00:12:48.320]   Facebook Messenger.
[00:12:48.320 --> 00:12:50.360]   I mean, everybody's going to data on these.
[00:12:50.360 --> 00:12:52.720]   Because the SMS was so expensive.
[00:12:52.720 --> 00:12:54.560]   We actually had a question from someone
[00:12:54.560 --> 00:12:58.480]   in the chat room about someone in our audience.
[00:12:58.480 --> 00:13:02.840]   In Zimbabwe, how much is data and how much is voice?
[00:13:02.840 --> 00:13:05.840]   What do you use?
[00:13:05.840 --> 00:13:07.840]   What do you-- what do you--
[00:13:07.840 --> 00:13:11.880]   How much do you pay for your cell plan?
[00:13:11.880 --> 00:13:13.520]   So he uses a Go phone.
[00:13:13.520 --> 00:13:14.320]   Well, no, no.
[00:13:14.320 --> 00:13:15.000]   And so what kind of--
[00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:17.000]   Five bucks?
[00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:17.560]   Excuse me.
[00:13:17.560 --> 00:13:18.280]   You got an Android.
[00:13:18.280 --> 00:13:18.680]   That's cool.
[00:13:18.680 --> 00:13:19.240]   And Zimbabwe.
[00:13:19.240 --> 00:13:22.160]   And how much do you do data versus talking on the phone?
[00:13:22.160 --> 00:13:22.880]   Data, SMS.
[00:13:22.880 --> 00:13:26.240]   So this is in Zimbabwe.
[00:13:26.240 --> 00:13:27.200]   So more data than--
[00:13:27.200 --> 00:13:27.700]   Right.
[00:13:27.700 --> 00:13:28.760]   That's the future, isn't it?
[00:13:28.760 --> 00:13:30.040]   Android.
[00:13:30.040 --> 00:13:31.360]   That's the--
[00:13:31.360 --> 00:13:35.320]   I mean, he's a very well connected.
[00:13:35.320 --> 00:13:37.000]   Is that I say?
[00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:40.120]   No, from Zimbabwe is obviously because he's here.
[00:13:40.120 --> 00:13:41.560]   And he's a Pixel Core member.
[00:13:41.560 --> 00:13:43.840]   He's obviously in the data elite, the digital elite
[00:13:43.840 --> 00:13:44.640]   in Zimbabwe.
[00:13:44.640 --> 00:13:47.200]   Nevertheless, I do think that that's where we're moving,
[00:13:47.200 --> 00:13:49.760]   whether we're there-- I think Andy's point is we're not there yet.
[00:13:49.760 --> 00:13:51.520]   But I think Andy, you agree.
[00:13:51.520 --> 00:13:53.440]   However, one year, two years, three years,
[00:13:53.440 --> 00:13:54.520]   we are moving in that direction.
[00:13:54.520 --> 00:13:55.680]   Well, in a lot of countries, I mean,
[00:13:55.680 --> 00:13:58.300]   looking at Rwanda or Kenya or Tanzania or Zimbabwe,
[00:13:58.300 --> 00:14:00.100]   you're seeing fiber running through all of these--
[00:14:00.100 --> 00:14:01.700]   Because they had no infrastructure.
[00:14:01.700 --> 00:14:02.940]   So if they're putting it in now, they're
[00:14:02.940 --> 00:14:04.180]   going to do the latest.
[00:14:04.180 --> 00:14:06.380]   That's where we were at this advantage.
[00:14:06.380 --> 00:14:11.180]   Because cell phones-- we got cellulized--
[00:14:11.180 --> 00:14:12.780]   if that's a word-- early.
[00:14:12.780 --> 00:14:15.900]   And so we have competing technology, CDMA, GSM.
[00:14:15.900 --> 00:14:17.220]   We have old infrastructure.
[00:14:17.220 --> 00:14:19.540]   It's always a bad thing to be the first.
[00:14:19.540 --> 00:14:21.780]   Kind of start somewhere.
[00:14:21.780 --> 00:14:25.420]   I do think this is one of the issues
[00:14:25.420 --> 00:14:28.460]   when you deal with all of these private stakeholders
[00:14:28.460 --> 00:14:31.960]   is that they're all trying to recoup all of their investment
[00:14:31.960 --> 00:14:34.220]   and maximize the profit on their investment.
[00:14:34.220 --> 00:14:36.280]   And that's why we have all these competing pieces.
[00:14:36.280 --> 00:14:39.560]   And we're still trying to use DSL to pay for the copper
[00:14:39.560 --> 00:14:42.280]   that we laid down before and all of those things.
[00:14:42.280 --> 00:14:43.900]   And I think that is a big challenge.
[00:14:43.900 --> 00:14:46.900]   You want to really feel bad, Mr. Huggy?
[00:14:46.900 --> 00:14:49.660]   And chat around.
[00:14:49.660 --> 00:14:50.660]   What's his name?
[00:14:50.660 --> 00:14:51.340]   I'm not making a--
[00:14:51.340 --> 00:14:51.860]   No, no, no.
[00:14:51.860 --> 00:14:52.420]   This is beautiful.
[00:14:52.420 --> 00:14:53.420]   It's running a Huggy Bear game.
[00:14:53.420 --> 00:14:54.780]   See what the word is on the street.
[00:14:54.780 --> 00:14:58.660]   Mr. Huggy in the UK says he has an iPhone 4.
[00:14:58.660 --> 00:14:59.740]   This is in the UK.
[00:14:59.740 --> 00:15:03.140]   200 SMS messages a month, 100 minutes of calling a month
[00:15:03.140 --> 00:15:04.100]   and a gigabyte of data.
[00:15:04.100 --> 00:15:04.860]   That's interesting.
[00:15:04.860 --> 00:15:06.820]   Only 100 minutes of calling, which is not much.
[00:15:06.820 --> 00:15:10.100]   And a gigabyte of data, which is for $31,
[00:15:10.100 --> 00:15:13.860]   equivalent of $31 a month, Mr. Huggy, you win.
[00:15:13.860 --> 00:15:14.740]   Well, 200 SMS though.
[00:15:14.740 --> 00:15:15.460]   I mean, I just--
[00:15:15.460 --> 00:15:16.300]   That's not that--
[00:15:16.300 --> 00:15:17.140]   That could not get me very far.
[00:15:17.140 --> 00:15:17.580]   It could get me like days.
[00:15:17.580 --> 00:15:19.940]   I have to do unlimited SMS.
[00:15:19.940 --> 00:15:21.380]   So let's talk about the iPhone 5,
[00:15:21.380 --> 00:15:24.540]   because I think we're getting close to iPhone 5 day.
[00:15:24.540 --> 00:15:26.940]   Cara Swisher in all things.
[00:15:26.940 --> 00:15:30.100]   He says, October, October, October.
[00:15:30.100 --> 00:15:31.100]   Do you all agree?
[00:15:31.100 --> 00:15:32.900]   Is there going to be an Apple announcement in the next couple
[00:15:32.900 --> 00:15:34.460]   of weeks, and then a shipping day in October?
[00:15:34.460 --> 00:15:36.340]   Do you think we're just--
[00:15:36.340 --> 00:15:37.580]   I don't get invited.
[00:15:37.580 --> 00:15:39.340]   Any invitations, anything?
[00:15:39.340 --> 00:15:40.340]   No, I don't feel invited.
[00:15:40.340 --> 00:15:42.420]   I've been invited anything as of today.
[00:15:42.420 --> 00:15:44.500]   Yeah, that's because you know me.
[00:15:44.500 --> 00:15:45.620]   You're off the list.
[00:15:45.620 --> 00:15:47.100]   And not go.
[00:15:47.100 --> 00:15:49.820]   If having to stink a Leo La Porte on me is--
[00:15:49.820 --> 00:15:50.340]   You do.
[00:15:50.340 --> 00:15:51.940]   It's part of the cost of knowing Leo La Porte.
[00:15:51.940 --> 00:15:52.300]   You know what?
[00:15:52.300 --> 00:15:53.420]   That's a price I'm willing to pay.
[00:15:53.420 --> 00:15:56.580]   You got my stink all over you, Andy.
[00:15:56.580 --> 00:15:59.460]   Deutsche Telekom.
[00:15:59.460 --> 00:16:02.220]   I walk into a room with Apple, and they say, you have--
[00:16:02.220 --> 00:16:03.220]   Cats, don't use it.
[00:16:03.220 --> 00:16:04.700]   No, it's Leo.
[00:16:04.700 --> 00:16:06.460]   I'm just friends with Leo La Porte.
[00:16:06.460 --> 00:16:07.940]   I have a dandereology.
[00:16:07.940 --> 00:16:09.940]   I'm trying to get you.
[00:16:09.940 --> 00:16:11.860]   Deutsche Telekom, whether because they're
[00:16:11.860 --> 00:16:14.420]   reading Cara Swisher, or because they actually
[00:16:14.420 --> 00:16:18.220]   know something, they're starting to offer iPhone reservations.
[00:16:18.220 --> 00:16:21.580]   iPhone 5, reservations, that's what they're calling it.
[00:16:21.580 --> 00:16:26.540]   Today, according to Bloomberg, but we don't know what that really
[00:16:26.540 --> 00:16:30.100]   means, they say because in anticipation
[00:16:30.100 --> 00:16:33.140]   of supply bottlenecks for the device,
[00:16:33.140 --> 00:16:37.740]   spokesman Alexander Schmetto said by phone--
[00:16:37.740 --> 00:16:40.020]   that's his name--
[00:16:40.020 --> 00:16:42.420]   to Bloomberg, they're going to hand out coupons for people
[00:16:42.420 --> 00:16:46.740]   who say, I wish to have not the current iPhone,
[00:16:46.740 --> 00:16:49.700]   but the next iPhone without providing the name or release
[00:16:49.700 --> 00:16:51.380]   details of the device.
[00:16:51.380 --> 00:16:54.540]   I'll take a coupon, Mr. Schmetto.
[00:16:54.540 --> 00:16:55.980]   So it really doesn't say anything, the fact
[00:16:55.980 --> 00:16:59.460]   that they're giving that out as meaningless, I guess.
[00:16:59.460 --> 00:17:01.380]   Although we are seeing more and more,
[00:17:01.380 --> 00:17:05.580]   as always, the drum beat starts to beat.
[00:17:05.580 --> 00:17:11.180]   I just saw on Mac rumors, pictures of iPhone 5 cases,
[00:17:11.180 --> 00:17:12.940]   which are very interesting.
[00:17:12.940 --> 00:17:15.780]   Again, we don't even know if--
[00:17:15.780 --> 00:17:18.820]   is there an iPhone 4S in October and iPhone 5 next June?
[00:17:18.820 --> 00:17:21.860]   Is there an iPhone 4S and a 5 in October?
[00:17:21.860 --> 00:17:23.420]   We don't know what's going to happen.
[00:17:23.420 --> 00:17:25.180]   But they are making cases, which would imply
[00:17:25.180 --> 00:17:28.020]   that it's not June, it's sooner, and they're big.
[00:17:28.020 --> 00:17:30.620]   They're the kind of cases you'd have a 4 and 1/2 inch
[00:17:30.620 --> 00:17:34.620]   screen for, and yet we've also seen cases for a little 3
[00:17:34.620 --> 00:17:37.100]   and 1/2 inch in smaller screens.
[00:17:37.100 --> 00:17:39.900]   So which is it?
[00:17:39.900 --> 00:17:43.140]   I'd be shocked if it were a larger screen.
[00:17:43.140 --> 00:17:43.820]   Oh, I'd love it.
[00:17:43.820 --> 00:17:45.500]   I'd get so excited if there were--
[00:17:45.500 --> 00:17:46.500]   A larger screen?
[00:17:46.500 --> 00:17:47.900]   Yeah.
[00:17:47.900 --> 00:17:51.060]   I've used the 4 and 3 inch screens, as you have, I'm sure,
[00:17:51.060 --> 00:17:52.780]   Andy, on the Evo.
[00:17:52.780 --> 00:17:55.140]   And don't you love those big screens?
[00:17:55.140 --> 00:17:55.660]   I do.
[00:17:55.660 --> 00:17:57.780]   I think that there's a real sweet spot there
[00:17:57.780 --> 00:17:59.980]   that it is a little bit less convenient,
[00:17:59.980 --> 00:18:02.740]   but man, that little extra real estate, especially
[00:18:02.740 --> 00:18:04.740]   on an Android phone where things are pretty cramped
[00:18:04.740 --> 00:18:06.620]   to begin with.
[00:18:06.620 --> 00:18:08.300]   Now, ordinarily you'd say, well, well,
[00:18:08.300 --> 00:18:10.180]   they would never do a bigger screen without telling developers
[00:18:10.180 --> 00:18:10.820]   about that first.
[00:18:10.820 --> 00:18:13.060]   But there really is enough resolution on the retina
[00:18:13.060 --> 00:18:16.020]   display to say, what if we just make it bigger?
[00:18:16.020 --> 00:18:17.460]   We'll just make the dots bigger.
[00:18:17.460 --> 00:18:22.020]   And it would still be a really nice performing little device.
[00:18:22.020 --> 00:18:26.900]   I'm not sure if they would like to do a larger format, though.
[00:18:26.900 --> 00:18:27.780]   I think that they're--
[00:18:27.780 --> 00:18:30.300]   So keep the same resolution, but on a bigger screen.
[00:18:30.300 --> 00:18:32.500]   If they're doing that this year, then I think that's--
[00:18:32.500 --> 00:18:33.980]   I'm OK with that.
[00:18:33.980 --> 00:18:36.220]   I'm not sure if they would do that this year, though.
[00:18:36.220 --> 00:18:37.060]   Isn't that--
[00:18:37.060 --> 00:18:39.140]   This might be for next June.
[00:18:39.140 --> 00:18:40.900]   It might be for next year.
[00:18:40.900 --> 00:18:44.740]   Because the apple that I know and love
[00:18:44.740 --> 00:18:48.340]   would want to make a bigger statement about a large screen
[00:18:48.340 --> 00:18:51.060]   iPhone than simply, oh, well, we talked to the parts
[00:18:51.060 --> 00:18:54.100]   supplier, and you had a whole buttload of these forward screens.
[00:18:54.100 --> 00:18:56.420]   We said, OK, well, what can you-- what kind of deal
[00:18:56.420 --> 00:18:56.740]   you can give?
[00:18:56.740 --> 00:18:58.700]   OK, 4-OK, give us a forward screen.
[00:18:58.700 --> 00:18:59.460]   That would be a--
[00:18:59.460 --> 00:19:02.540]   We rethought the phone.
[00:19:02.540 --> 00:19:03.540]   Exactly.
[00:19:03.540 --> 00:19:06.860]   Exactly.
[00:19:06.860 --> 00:19:10.140]   AT&T is advancing its upgrade dates,
[00:19:10.140 --> 00:19:14.580]   which is not unusual when they want to get
[00:19:14.580 --> 00:19:16.740]   people ready for a new phone.
[00:19:16.740 --> 00:19:18.860]   It also looks like they're preparing for installations
[00:19:18.860 --> 00:19:21.060]   going on on 21st, which would--
[00:19:21.060 --> 00:19:22.660]   on October, which would--
[00:19:22.660 --> 00:19:24.340]   21st of October in the stores.
[00:19:24.340 --> 00:19:25.260]   In the stores?
[00:19:25.260 --> 00:19:25.900]   Why that date?
[00:19:25.900 --> 00:19:26.740]   Is that the date they're giving us?
[00:19:26.740 --> 00:19:29.180]   Well, it might be a Friday before a--
[00:19:29.180 --> 00:19:30.540]   I don't want to wait that long.
[00:19:30.540 --> 00:19:31.620]   That's more than a month.
[00:19:31.620 --> 00:19:33.420]   That doesn't mean that's when the announcement will
[00:19:33.420 --> 00:19:33.940]   happen, though.
[00:19:33.940 --> 00:19:35.900]   No, I want the phone, though.
[00:19:35.900 --> 00:19:39.380]   8 megapixel camera, 8.5 processor.
[00:19:39.380 --> 00:19:41.780]   These are all acceptable.
[00:19:41.780 --> 00:19:44.380]   Best Buy is prepping for an October launch as well.
[00:19:44.380 --> 00:19:49.940]   This is the sort of stuff that I was talking about a week
[00:19:49.940 --> 00:19:50.660]   or two ago.
[00:19:50.660 --> 00:19:51.420]   They're usually--
[00:19:51.420 --> 00:19:52.140]   But you don't know--
[00:19:52.140 --> 00:19:52.700]   It's that drum beat.
[00:19:52.700 --> 00:19:53.700]   --what's going to happen.
[00:19:53.700 --> 00:19:57.540]   If you get one notice about how one store is preparing
[00:19:57.540 --> 00:19:59.940]   for a launch, it's like, OK, well, some guy came back
[00:19:59.940 --> 00:20:02.020]   from the Ramadan conference room with a slide
[00:20:02.020 --> 00:20:03.380]   that he might have misinterpreted.
[00:20:03.380 --> 00:20:06.580]   When you see that many people coming from that many sources,
[00:20:06.580 --> 00:20:08.020]   you start-- not that there was--
[00:20:08.020 --> 00:20:08.980]   it's not that there was any mystery
[00:20:08.980 --> 00:20:10.980]   that there was going to be a new iPhone this year anyway.
[00:20:10.980 --> 00:20:12.980]   This is the sort of stuff we like to see.
[00:20:12.980 --> 00:20:16.060]   Now, I love this story from last week.
[00:20:16.060 --> 00:20:18.780]   And again, this is one that we are late on.
[00:20:18.780 --> 00:20:21.220]   I know everybody's heard this already.
[00:20:21.220 --> 00:20:25.060]   But it was after we went to press,
[00:20:25.060 --> 00:20:28.540]   after we put the show to bed last week.
[00:20:28.540 --> 00:20:36.180]   The whole CNET says SFPD investigating iPhone 5,
[00:20:36.180 --> 00:20:39.660]   lost at a tequila bar in San Francisco.
[00:20:39.660 --> 00:20:42.380]   Then San Francisco weekly, a weekly newspaper,
[00:20:42.380 --> 00:20:44.180]   which with apparently some pretty good reporters
[00:20:44.180 --> 00:20:45.700]   calls the SFPD.
[00:20:45.700 --> 00:20:50.140]   This is on Thursday last and says, they said, no.
[00:20:50.140 --> 00:20:50.660]   Didn't do it.
[00:20:50.660 --> 00:20:52.180]   No, it didn't happen.
[00:20:52.180 --> 00:20:54.700]   Then with a little more investigation,
[00:20:54.700 --> 00:20:57.460]   they went to the guy who claimed that the police had
[00:20:57.460 --> 00:20:58.780]   searched his house.
[00:20:58.780 --> 00:21:00.500]   And they given him a number.
[00:21:00.500 --> 00:21:02.220]   They called that number.
[00:21:02.220 --> 00:21:04.380]   And they got Tony.
[00:21:04.380 --> 00:21:10.380]   Tony, who happens to work for Apple Security.
[00:21:10.380 --> 00:21:11.620]   Hey, this is Tony Colone.
[00:21:11.620 --> 00:21:13.620]   What do you want?
[00:21:13.620 --> 00:21:15.820]   Yeah, you left your number at my house.
[00:21:15.820 --> 00:21:16.860]   About the iPhone 4.
[00:21:16.860 --> 00:21:18.740]   Yeah, we'll be right over.
[00:21:18.740 --> 00:21:21.300]   So it was Apple investigators.
[00:21:21.300 --> 00:21:24.060]   That's pretty much confirmed.
[00:21:24.060 --> 00:21:27.300]   And apparently what happened, and the police now are saying,
[00:21:27.300 --> 00:21:29.580]   well, what happened was Apple called us,
[00:21:29.580 --> 00:21:30.860]   said we've got a missing iPhone.
[00:21:30.860 --> 00:21:32.980]   We've got GPS coordinates for it.
[00:21:32.980 --> 00:21:36.820]   And they dispatched three plain closed officers, two or three.
[00:21:36.820 --> 00:21:37.340]   It's unclear.
[00:21:37.340 --> 00:21:39.260]   From San Francisco police department
[00:21:39.260 --> 00:21:43.780]   to join two Apple investigators,
[00:21:43.780 --> 00:21:47.460]   knocked on this guy's door.
[00:21:47.460 --> 00:21:50.740]   And now here's where it gets a little dicey.
[00:21:50.740 --> 00:21:56.300]   The guy claims that they all identified as SFPD.
[00:21:56.300 --> 00:21:57.460]   Two of them go in.
[00:21:57.460 --> 00:21:59.700]   I think later in the article, I think they called them again.
[00:21:59.700 --> 00:22:02.220]   And he said he's not sure if they all identified them.
[00:22:02.220 --> 00:22:03.420]   He believed them to be.
[00:22:03.420 --> 00:22:03.940]   He believed to me.
[00:22:03.940 --> 00:22:06.100]   But he said I would never have let them in if I
[00:22:06.100 --> 00:22:07.940]   thought that they weren't the police department.
[00:22:07.940 --> 00:22:11.060]   But I was trying to cooperate with the police investigation.
[00:22:11.060 --> 00:22:14.260]   SFPD says our three plain closed officers stayed outside
[00:22:14.260 --> 00:22:15.940]   while the two Apple investigators went.
[00:22:15.940 --> 00:22:22.700]   And the guy also says that they threatened him saying,
[00:22:22.700 --> 00:22:24.940]   is everybody here legal?
[00:22:24.940 --> 00:22:26.180]   You could be in a lot of trouble.
[00:22:26.180 --> 00:22:29.260]   They're talking Sergio Calderon, whose house says,
[00:22:29.260 --> 00:22:30.780]   they searched the guy's house.
[00:22:30.780 --> 00:22:32.220]   They searched his computers, found
[00:22:32.220 --> 00:22:36.300]   no traces of the iPhone 5 and left.
[00:22:36.300 --> 00:22:37.940]   I think now there's reasonably some heat
[00:22:37.940 --> 00:22:39.260]   on the San Francisco police department
[00:22:39.260 --> 00:22:42.380]   to explain how they helped, why they helped.
[00:22:42.380 --> 00:22:45.020]   What's going on?
[00:22:45.020 --> 00:22:47.060]   I think if I had lost-- in fact, I know.
[00:22:47.060 --> 00:22:51.580]   Because remember we saw that blog of the guy whose Apple
[00:22:51.580 --> 00:22:52.700]   laptop was stolen.
[00:22:52.700 --> 00:22:56.460]   And he had pictures of the thief using it, sitting on a couch.
[00:22:56.460 --> 00:22:58.700]   He had to actually create a blog to get the police,
[00:22:58.700 --> 00:23:00.900]   save his complete, to even help him,
[00:23:00.900 --> 00:23:02.420]   and finally shamed them into it.
[00:23:02.420 --> 00:23:06.060]   So clearly Apple has a little more cloud.
[00:23:06.060 --> 00:23:06.580]   What do you think?
[00:23:06.580 --> 00:23:09.780]   I feel like this is not really--
[00:23:09.780 --> 00:23:12.180]   redounds more to the shame of the police department
[00:23:12.180 --> 00:23:13.540]   than of Apple itself.
[00:23:13.540 --> 00:23:13.980]   It does.
[00:23:13.980 --> 00:23:16.940]   I'm trying to figure out if they had a GPS location that it
[00:23:16.940 --> 00:23:17.660]   was in that house.
[00:23:17.660 --> 00:23:18.820]   Have they not have the phone?
[00:23:18.820 --> 00:23:19.780]   How did he not have the phone?
[00:23:19.780 --> 00:23:21.180]   We'll be through it out the window.
[00:23:21.180 --> 00:23:23.060]   But it was-- yeah, I mean--
[00:23:23.060 --> 00:23:24.060]   What problems-- here's what happens.
[00:23:24.060 --> 00:23:26.260]   Here's the issue is you have someone-- the only thing
[00:23:26.260 --> 00:23:27.460]   I'll say about this-- and I do think
[00:23:27.460 --> 00:23:28.940]   they mishandled this.
[00:23:28.940 --> 00:23:33.300]   But I will say they had a GPS location of that phone
[00:23:33.300 --> 00:23:33.940]   at his house.
[00:23:33.940 --> 00:23:34.300]   Right.
[00:23:34.300 --> 00:23:35.700]   Now they may not have been able to find it
[00:23:35.700 --> 00:23:37.420]   because the GPS is not accurate enough.
[00:23:37.420 --> 00:23:39.420]   But he can't start acting like he's all innocent.
[00:23:39.420 --> 00:23:42.300]   Because they're-- I mean, if they have a GPS of that phone
[00:23:42.300 --> 00:23:44.580]   at his house, it's at his house.
[00:23:44.580 --> 00:23:45.180]   The man has to--
[00:23:45.180 --> 00:23:47.900]   Oh, well, well, well, man.
[00:23:47.900 --> 00:23:50.260]   You really think that that's conclusive evidence
[00:23:50.260 --> 00:23:51.540]   that this guy had the phone?
[00:23:51.540 --> 00:23:53.580]   How would they-- how would they-- how would you know--
[00:23:53.580 --> 00:23:55.700]   I think they were entering this conversation
[00:23:55.700 --> 00:23:57.420]   with a fair bit of certainty that it was at the--
[00:23:57.420 --> 00:23:58.260]   Sounds like it.
[00:23:58.260 --> 00:24:02.220]   Because how else would they have that phone's GPS location?
[00:24:02.220 --> 00:24:05.100]   If it was-- they're not spoofing a GPS location
[00:24:05.100 --> 00:24:06.020]   at the phone.
[00:24:06.020 --> 00:24:07.740]   I mean, it is-- so I mean--
[00:24:07.740 --> 00:24:10.300]   Calderon says he never had it.
[00:24:10.300 --> 00:24:12.380]   What do you think, Annie?
[00:24:12.380 --> 00:24:15.860]   So many variables here, depending on who's telling the truth.
[00:24:15.860 --> 00:24:18.140]   All the people who have reasons to lie on all--
[00:24:18.140 --> 00:24:19.220]   really on all sides.
[00:24:19.220 --> 00:24:22.500]   There are good reasons to lie about what you're doing here.
[00:24:22.500 --> 00:24:24.020]   There are other piece of information
[00:24:24.020 --> 00:24:26.380]   was that there were some of these news reports
[00:24:26.380 --> 00:24:29.500]   are saying that the homeowner admitted
[00:24:29.500 --> 00:24:32.500]   that he was in the bar where that phone had--
[00:24:32.500 --> 00:24:33.500]   What?
[00:24:33.500 --> 00:24:34.100]   --was.
[00:24:34.100 --> 00:24:35.020]   I'm trying to find--
[00:24:35.020 --> 00:24:35.540]   I'm trying to find--
[00:24:35.540 --> 00:24:36.380]   I haven't seen that one.
[00:24:36.380 --> 00:24:37.660]   That thickens the plot, doesn't it?
[00:24:37.660 --> 00:24:41.220]   But that-- well, if that's true, because I've been trying--
[00:24:41.220 --> 00:24:42.740]   when this first hit a few days ago,
[00:24:42.740 --> 00:24:44.500]   I was trying to call around just to find out,
[00:24:44.500 --> 00:24:46.620]   because this is such a--
[00:24:46.620 --> 00:24:47.860]   he said, then they said.
[00:24:47.860 --> 00:24:51.380]   And then also, there's also a problem of when cops come--
[00:24:51.380 --> 00:24:52.700]   I've never had this experience, fortunately.
[00:24:52.700 --> 00:24:54.580]   But when cops-- I imagine that when cops come to your door
[00:24:54.580 --> 00:24:56.300]   unexpectedly and ask to look around,
[00:24:56.300 --> 00:24:57.500]   there's a lot of adrenaline.
[00:24:57.500 --> 00:24:58.980]   You're seeing a lot of things.
[00:24:58.980 --> 00:25:00.900]   But then a day later, when you're starting to piece things
[00:25:00.900 --> 00:25:04.780]   together, how much detail did you lose in your memory?
[00:25:04.780 --> 00:25:06.580]   And how much are you simply--
[00:25:06.580 --> 00:25:10.660]   now that your brain chemistry is starting to come back online.
[00:25:10.660 --> 00:25:15.940]   So if we go to the generic stuff here, I really--
[00:25:15.940 --> 00:25:19.460]   I wish that Apple prosecuted every single lost device
[00:25:19.460 --> 00:25:22.100]   as energetically as this.
[00:25:22.100 --> 00:25:26.380]   The official store policy is that you can file a police report.
[00:25:26.380 --> 00:25:29.300]   You can report the serial number of your iPhone stolen.
[00:25:29.300 --> 00:25:32.420]   If that person-- if someone finds your iPhone
[00:25:32.420 --> 00:25:35.420]   and comes to any Apple store to get service on it,
[00:25:35.420 --> 00:25:38.100]   they don't-- Apple is really not going to do anything about it.
[00:25:38.100 --> 00:25:44.500]   We're asked right here, we got the full force of the law
[00:25:44.500 --> 00:25:46.420]   or the non-law coming up at the--
[00:25:46.420 --> 00:25:48.260]   I found the reference that you're talking about, Andy.
[00:25:48.260 --> 00:25:50.860]   It's from SF Weekly.
[00:25:50.860 --> 00:25:53.180]   This is during an interview with SF Weekly.
[00:25:53.180 --> 00:25:58.940]   Sergio Calderoni's 22 years old did admit that he had been at Cava
[00:25:58.940 --> 00:26:02.260]   22, the Tequila Bar, over the weekend.
[00:26:02.260 --> 00:26:05.020]   And so he said, yeah, I was there.
[00:26:05.020 --> 00:26:05.520]   Yeah.
[00:26:05.520 --> 00:26:06.700]   And there was a GPS location.
[00:26:06.700 --> 00:26:07.980]   And there was a GPS location.
[00:26:07.980 --> 00:26:09.900]   And what I want to say is I want to make sure it's clear.
[00:26:09.900 --> 00:26:13.460]   I think that Apple and SFPD mishandled this,
[00:26:13.460 --> 00:26:16.780]   miscommunicated, and should not have been able to go into his house.
[00:26:16.780 --> 00:26:17.740]   So I'm not saying--
[00:26:17.740 --> 00:26:20.300]   No, I think that it--
[00:26:20.300 --> 00:26:21.780]   I'm sorry if I'm fumbling as I said.
[00:26:21.780 --> 00:26:25.820]   I'm just going to use the idea of electricity back on.
[00:26:25.820 --> 00:26:28.300]   The thing is, Apple acted appropriately
[00:26:28.300 --> 00:26:30.100]   if they had these two pieces of information
[00:26:30.100 --> 00:26:31.860]   that this person was at that bar.
[00:26:31.860 --> 00:26:35.300]   The phone is saying is telling the Apple that, yes, I am at this house.
[00:26:35.300 --> 00:26:38.340]   It's OK for them to coordinate with local law enforcement
[00:26:38.340 --> 00:26:42.340]   to see if they can get access to that place and take a look around.
[00:26:42.340 --> 00:26:44.420]   However, this is a reminder of something
[00:26:44.420 --> 00:26:48.900]   that I think the majority of people just can't get behind,
[00:26:48.900 --> 00:26:51.660]   that if a police officer comes to your house--
[00:26:51.660 --> 00:26:53.500]   a police officer with a badge and everything,
[00:26:53.500 --> 00:26:55.580]   comes to your house without a warrant
[00:26:55.580 --> 00:26:59.060]   and asks to get inside your house, unless they have--
[00:26:59.060 --> 00:27:01.380]   really, they don't have any-- you have the ability to say,
[00:27:01.380 --> 00:27:04.180]   I'm sorry, unless you get a warrant, I'm not letting you in.
[00:27:04.180 --> 00:27:06.300]   There are a lot of different cases in which really,
[00:27:06.300 --> 00:27:07.780]   there's nothing they can do about it.
[00:27:07.780 --> 00:27:09.940]   So mistake number one was leveling people inside your house
[00:27:09.940 --> 00:27:12.180]   and saying, yes, please, look through my entire house
[00:27:12.180 --> 00:27:14.020]   for this thing that I'm going to say that I don't have.
[00:27:14.020 --> 00:27:15.020]   Right.
[00:27:15.020 --> 00:27:17.620]   The second thing is that-- and this is another really difficult
[00:27:17.620 --> 00:27:20.740]   thing for innocent people to think of as saying,
[00:27:20.740 --> 00:27:22.860]   I'm not going to answer any questions without a lawyer
[00:27:22.860 --> 00:27:23.380]   present.
[00:27:23.380 --> 00:27:24.780]   You're not arresting me for anything.
[00:27:24.780 --> 00:27:26.620]   You don't have a warrant for anything.
[00:27:26.620 --> 00:27:27.940]   I don't have to tell you where I was.
[00:27:27.940 --> 00:27:31.060]   I don't have to say yes or no whether or not I have this phone.
[00:27:31.060 --> 00:27:32.740]   My wife and I have this fight all the time,
[00:27:32.740 --> 00:27:35.180]   because I saw, as you obviously did,
[00:27:35.180 --> 00:27:39.820]   that really excellent lecture at a law school,
[00:27:39.820 --> 00:27:41.740]   I can't remember which law school by a lawyer who says,
[00:27:41.740 --> 00:27:43.060]   don't not talk to the police.
[00:27:43.060 --> 00:27:45.500]   It will never be of any benefit to you
[00:27:45.500 --> 00:27:47.340]   to an anyway talk to the police.
[00:27:47.340 --> 00:27:49.900]   You should just clam up.
[00:27:49.900 --> 00:27:52.140]   I kind of disagree with that, because I've
[00:27:52.140 --> 00:27:57.620]   known a lot of state troopers, not in a professional sense.
[00:27:57.620 --> 00:28:00.140]   But there are a lot of problems where
[00:28:00.140 --> 00:28:02.380]   when you're just talking to these people socially
[00:28:02.380 --> 00:28:04.540]   about how they do their jobs, it's like, you know what?
[00:28:04.540 --> 00:28:07.260]   I have a hunch there's something wrong with this car.
[00:28:07.260 --> 00:28:09.660]   If you let me search it, I'm going
[00:28:09.660 --> 00:28:11.940]   to apologize for holding up.
[00:28:11.940 --> 00:28:13.380]   I'm going to let you go in 10 minutes.
[00:28:13.380 --> 00:28:16.060]   If you say no, it's then my call whether or not
[00:28:16.060 --> 00:28:17.420]   I'm going to take this to the next level,
[00:28:17.420 --> 00:28:20.020]   because I don't have the ability to simply demand
[00:28:20.020 --> 00:28:21.060]   to search your car.
[00:28:21.060 --> 00:28:23.740]   I do have the ability to hold you here by the side of the road
[00:28:23.740 --> 00:28:26.460]   for X amount of time while I wake up the right judge
[00:28:26.460 --> 00:28:28.300]   to give me the authority to turn out to--
[00:28:28.300 --> 00:28:29.860]   Well, and that was probably--
[00:28:29.860 --> 00:28:30.860]   I'm going to--
[00:28:30.860 --> 00:28:34.340]   That was probably Calderon's thinking is, well, I don't have it.
[00:28:34.340 --> 00:28:35.260]   I know I don't have it.
[00:28:35.260 --> 00:28:36.340]   I just know evidence.
[00:28:36.340 --> 00:28:38.340]   This goes away in 10 minutes if I just let it lock them in.
[00:28:38.340 --> 00:28:39.500]   And in fact, it did go away.
[00:28:39.500 --> 00:28:41.100]   And the parent would--
[00:28:41.100 --> 00:28:43.380]   I would never have let them have access to my computers,
[00:28:43.380 --> 00:28:43.900]   though.
[00:28:43.900 --> 00:28:44.740]   Never.
[00:28:44.740 --> 00:28:45.860]   He let them in.
[00:28:45.860 --> 00:28:49.740]   His car, his home, his computer-- in fact, of course,
[00:28:49.740 --> 00:28:51.620]   they're looking for evidence that at some any point
[00:28:51.620 --> 00:28:55.020]   he'd linked the phone to his iTunes.
[00:28:55.020 --> 00:28:55.860]   Found none of that.
[00:28:55.860 --> 00:28:57.060]   There was no evidence at all.
[00:28:57.060 --> 00:28:59.100]   They offered him $300.
[00:28:59.100 --> 00:29:01.180]   They said, well, buy that phone from you.
[00:29:01.180 --> 00:29:02.660]   And no questions asked.
[00:29:02.660 --> 00:29:05.260]   And then Tony gives him the card and walks out.
[00:29:05.260 --> 00:29:10.220]   Tony's-- the appel investigator is a former police officer.
[00:29:10.220 --> 00:29:11.460]   So probably carries himself.
[00:29:11.460 --> 00:29:13.620]   In fact, I was looking at his LinkedIn--
[00:29:13.620 --> 00:29:15.420]   SF Weekly has his LinkedIn and Facebook page.
[00:29:15.420 --> 00:29:16.540]   He looks like a cop.
[00:29:16.540 --> 00:29:17.700]   So you probably believe it.
[00:29:17.700 --> 00:29:19.860]   And what it sounds like happened is
[00:29:19.860 --> 00:29:21.860]   is that you had two cops say we're
[00:29:21.860 --> 00:29:23.260]   here from the police department.
[00:29:23.260 --> 00:29:23.980]   Can we search?
[00:29:23.980 --> 00:29:25.380]   And he said yes to those two cops.
[00:29:25.380 --> 00:29:25.900]   And the other two go--
[00:29:25.900 --> 00:29:26.900]   And the other two go--
[00:29:26.900 --> 00:29:27.700]   And other people walked in.
[00:29:27.700 --> 00:29:30.020]   And it was one of those things that you
[00:29:30.020 --> 00:29:30.700]   have to be careful of.
[00:29:30.700 --> 00:29:31.980]   The other thing you have to be careful of when
[00:29:31.980 --> 00:29:33.740]   you just let people come in and look around.
[00:29:33.740 --> 00:29:35.860]   The search warrant has very specific things
[00:29:35.860 --> 00:29:37.300]   they're allowed to look for.
[00:29:37.300 --> 00:29:39.140]   And if they find anything--
[00:29:39.140 --> 00:29:42.020]   it really restricts what they can actually do there.
[00:29:42.020 --> 00:29:47.020]   So I think that it is important to think about those things.
[00:29:47.020 --> 00:29:52.140]   But like Andy said, if you just flat out, say,
[00:29:52.140 --> 00:29:53.700]   you can't come in without a warrant,
[00:29:53.700 --> 00:29:56.700]   you usually turn a whole lot of switches on.
[00:29:56.700 --> 00:29:58.100]   That are there.
[00:29:58.100 --> 00:30:00.420]   That weren't there before you did that.
[00:30:00.420 --> 00:30:02.100]   I would have done that to Calderon.
[00:30:02.100 --> 00:30:02.980]   But you're right.
[00:30:02.980 --> 00:30:05.860]   There's a big question that's raised by the fact
[00:30:05.860 --> 00:30:07.660]   that he admits he was at COVA-22.
[00:30:07.660 --> 00:30:09.380]   And the GPS went to his house.
[00:30:09.380 --> 00:30:10.540]   But those two things--
[00:30:10.540 --> 00:30:11.820]   Now sometimes the GPS is wrong.
[00:30:11.820 --> 00:30:12.740]   I've seen a big circle.
[00:30:12.740 --> 00:30:14.260]   But that's kind of a weird coincidence.
[00:30:14.260 --> 00:30:15.900]   It's not that big of a circle.
[00:30:15.900 --> 00:30:17.220]   Well, it could be.
[00:30:17.220 --> 00:30:18.420]   At first, the GPS--
[00:30:18.420 --> 00:30:20.540]   of course, a couple of things happen, right?
[00:30:20.540 --> 00:30:22.780]   The way that Find My iPhone works
[00:30:22.780 --> 00:30:24.500]   is it remembers your last GPS coordinate.
[00:30:24.500 --> 00:30:26.180]   So probably if the phones turned off,
[00:30:26.180 --> 00:30:27.620]   there's no more GPS coordinates.
[00:30:27.620 --> 00:30:28.900]   It was the last coordinate.
[00:30:28.900 --> 00:30:30.420]   Now what if the bad guy--
[00:30:30.420 --> 00:30:32.540]   OK, I'm giving you the what if that if I were the defense
[00:30:32.540 --> 00:30:34.340]   attorney I would absolutely bring up?
[00:30:34.340 --> 00:30:36.980]   Sure, the bad guy was walking by the house.
[00:30:36.980 --> 00:30:39.420]   As he's walking by, he presses the button
[00:30:39.420 --> 00:30:40.460]   to turn the phone off.
[00:30:40.460 --> 00:30:42.300]   That's the last GPS coordinate.
[00:30:42.300 --> 00:30:45.180]   And it could be three meters.
[00:30:45.180 --> 00:30:47.700]   But you've seen 20, 50, 60 meters, right?
[00:30:47.700 --> 00:30:49.740]   It could be smack dab in the living room
[00:30:49.740 --> 00:30:51.900]   if that's where he turned off the phone.
[00:30:51.900 --> 00:30:52.580]   I don't--
[00:30:52.580 --> 00:30:53.460]   That is not--
[00:30:53.460 --> 00:30:54.140]   And we have no idea.
[00:30:54.140 --> 00:30:55.020]   That reasonable doubt.
[00:30:55.020 --> 00:30:57.340]   I know this because I was on a jury once.
[00:30:57.340 --> 00:31:01.180]   Reasonable doubt that he didn't have the phone in his house.
[00:31:01.180 --> 00:31:03.060]   Oh, no, but they're not prosecuting me.
[00:31:03.060 --> 00:31:03.940]   No, they're not.
[00:31:03.940 --> 00:31:05.980]   So they're not looking for reasonable doubt at the moment.
[00:31:05.980 --> 00:31:07.500]   So that's the issue.
[00:31:07.500 --> 00:31:09.980]   But I think that I have a hard time believing
[00:31:09.980 --> 00:31:11.420]   that they would just come to someone's house
[00:31:11.420 --> 00:31:12.820]   if they had a really big circle.
[00:31:12.820 --> 00:31:14.220]   Right, because as you well know--
[00:31:14.220 --> 00:31:15.660]   They'd be looking at-- I mean, I just don't think they--
[00:31:15.660 --> 00:31:18.980]   I'm innocent you have nothing to fear from the police.
[00:31:18.980 --> 00:31:20.380]   I didn't say that.
[00:31:20.380 --> 00:31:22.060]   Not giving up enough credit here.
[00:31:22.060 --> 00:31:24.020]   Maybe this was just-- you know what?
[00:31:24.020 --> 00:31:26.700]   This is the most embarrassing thing that could happen to us
[00:31:26.700 --> 00:31:28.820]   in 2011 that we lost another phone.
[00:31:28.820 --> 00:31:32.540]   What if we do a hand-handed overbearing church
[00:31:32.540 --> 00:31:35.940]   just to obscure the fact that we lost another damn phone?
[00:31:35.940 --> 00:31:40.260]   Well, they in fact have a listing now, a job listing for Apple
[00:31:40.260 --> 00:31:43.340]   Product Security Manager for somebody
[00:31:43.340 --> 00:31:46.620]   who will keep an eye on all of these new testing products
[00:31:46.620 --> 00:31:49.420]   and make sure that they don't get lost ever again.
[00:31:49.420 --> 00:31:51.340]   Honestly, whenever you're about Android phones getting lost,
[00:31:51.340 --> 00:31:52.620]   I think they get lost and no one notices.
[00:31:52.620 --> 00:31:53.820]   Because nobody cares.
[00:31:53.820 --> 00:31:55.140]   And I got to point out that--
[00:31:55.140 --> 00:31:57.340]   Really, it's like finding a nickel on the side.
[00:31:57.340 --> 00:31:59.260]   Yeah, it's not worth putting over.
[00:31:59.260 --> 00:32:00.940]   That diamond doesn't.
[00:32:00.940 --> 00:32:03.180]   But I got to point out, we're all going to know all the details
[00:32:03.180 --> 00:32:04.780]   of this phone in four weeks.
[00:32:04.780 --> 00:32:06.260]   And it's ridiculous.
[00:32:06.260 --> 00:32:09.660]   And Apple-- and I think that Apple--
[00:32:09.660 --> 00:32:11.500]   this is a good lesson for SFPD and Apple
[00:32:11.500 --> 00:32:13.740]   to realize that anything they do related to this
[00:32:13.740 --> 00:32:15.300]   is going to be heavily publicized.
[00:32:15.300 --> 00:32:16.780]   And they really needed to cover--
[00:32:16.780 --> 00:32:18.500]   cross their T's and dot their I's a little better
[00:32:18.500 --> 00:32:19.220]   than they did here.
[00:32:19.220 --> 00:32:20.780]   Now, it is up to Calderon.
[00:32:20.780 --> 00:32:22.820]   The SFPD has said it is up to Calderon.
[00:32:22.820 --> 00:32:24.460]   If he files a complaint, we will investigate
[00:32:24.460 --> 00:32:28.740]   he has of this time not required a complaint.
[00:32:28.740 --> 00:32:31.100]   So I think that this--
[00:32:31.100 --> 00:32:32.500]   I think-- OK.
[00:32:32.500 --> 00:32:34.420]   Now this isn't law.
[00:32:34.420 --> 00:32:37.140]   We're just rank speculation.
[00:32:37.140 --> 00:32:38.020]   He picked up the phone.
[00:32:38.020 --> 00:32:41.780]   He had the phone, turned the phone off, realized, oh crap.
[00:32:41.780 --> 00:32:45.820]   And threw it out the window as far as he could,
[00:32:45.820 --> 00:32:49.260]   either when they knocked on the door or before then.
[00:32:49.260 --> 00:32:51.300]   And now the guy is not going to press charges.
[00:32:51.300 --> 00:32:53.540]   He doesn't want anything more to do with it.
[00:32:53.540 --> 00:32:54.260]   He's done.
[00:32:54.260 --> 00:32:56.740]   And if I were Apple, I'd look around in the vicinity.
[00:32:56.740 --> 00:33:00.060]   I'd search those dumpsters and rooftops in the neighborhood.
[00:33:00.060 --> 00:33:02.100]   I have a very hard time believing
[00:33:02.100 --> 00:33:04.780]   that someone at that bar would also
[00:33:04.780 --> 00:33:06.420]   have a GPS location that is very low for us.
[00:33:06.420 --> 00:33:08.620]   Can you flush an iPhone down the toilet?
[00:33:08.620 --> 00:33:09.060]   I don't know.
[00:33:09.060 --> 00:33:10.380]   I don't think that's a good idea.
[00:33:10.380 --> 00:33:12.100]   I don't think it'll play back again.
[00:33:12.100 --> 00:33:14.060]   You know, our toilets were backed up over the weekend.
[00:33:14.060 --> 00:33:21.820]   And by the way, mysteriously healed.
[00:33:21.820 --> 00:33:24.940]   Because we found out a plumber on Labor Day's 200 bucks an hour.
[00:33:24.940 --> 00:33:26.260]   So we decided to let it rest.
[00:33:26.260 --> 00:33:27.940]   And it came back all by itself.
[00:33:27.940 --> 00:33:30.460]   Maybe that's what I would be if we didn't have any electricity.
[00:33:30.460 --> 00:33:34.900]   I think Jason Howell stole the iPhone.
[00:33:34.900 --> 00:33:36.340]   No, he says no.
[00:33:36.340 --> 00:33:38.900]   He denies it.
[00:33:38.900 --> 00:33:41.900]   Looks like Apple will be globally the number one--
[00:33:41.900 --> 00:33:42.700]   well, I don't know.
[00:33:42.700 --> 00:33:43.660]   I'm looking at this chart.
[00:33:43.660 --> 00:33:47.020]   I can't make header tails of this.
[00:33:47.020 --> 00:33:47.740]   The number one--
[00:33:47.740 --> 00:33:48.500]   The blue is last year.
[00:33:48.500 --> 00:33:49.580]   The red is this year.
[00:33:49.580 --> 00:33:50.260]   Thank you.
[00:33:50.260 --> 00:33:51.100]   And the--
[00:33:51.100 --> 00:33:52.700]   What is the line?
[00:33:52.700 --> 00:33:56.500]   The line is the Zippity-Doo-Dah line.
[00:33:56.500 --> 00:33:57.620]   I don't even understand this.
[00:33:57.620 --> 00:33:58.900]   This is crazy.
[00:33:58.900 --> 00:34:00.460]   Year over year.
[00:34:00.460 --> 00:34:02.260]   So year over year growth percentage.
[00:34:02.260 --> 00:34:03.300]   So it's-- so it's--
[00:34:03.300 --> 00:34:04.700]   Apple's jumped 81%.
[00:34:04.700 --> 00:34:05.460]   Oh, I see.
[00:34:05.460 --> 00:34:07.300]   And Nuki has dropped 25%.
[00:34:07.300 --> 00:34:08.980]   Apple's up 81.9%.
[00:34:08.980 --> 00:34:10.620]   Noki down 25%.
[00:34:10.620 --> 00:34:12.580]   Samsung, 191%.
[00:34:12.580 --> 00:34:14.260]   They're number two.
[00:34:14.260 --> 00:34:17.300]   But Apple probably will hold the title for top--
[00:34:17.300 --> 00:34:17.860]   And according to--
[00:34:17.860 --> 00:34:18.260]   Global smartphone.
[00:34:18.260 --> 00:34:18.860]   --in a global smartphone.
[00:34:18.860 --> 00:34:22.780]   Apple, the Samsung junk has been all a ruse.
[00:34:22.780 --> 00:34:25.820]   I think the-- next-- I think the reason that Samsung said,
[00:34:25.820 --> 00:34:27.140]   all right, all right, you're going to sue us.
[00:34:27.140 --> 00:34:29.180]   Let's see the iPhone 5 and the iPad 3,
[00:34:29.180 --> 00:34:32.420]   because I think the iPhone 5 is going to look just like a galaxy.
[00:34:32.420 --> 00:34:34.820]   That's what I think.
[00:34:34.820 --> 00:34:35.740]   What do I know?
[00:34:35.740 --> 00:34:36.380]   Let's take a break.
[00:34:36.380 --> 00:34:37.500]   We're going to come back with more.
[00:34:37.500 --> 00:34:39.620]   Andy Inako, Alex Lindsey.
[00:34:39.620 --> 00:34:44.820]   We'll talk about patents, the Kindle tablet, MG's scene one,
[00:34:44.820 --> 00:34:50.140]   and some lion information, too, since we are called Mac.
[00:34:50.140 --> 00:34:53.700]   Break weekly, but first let's talk about Go to Meeting.
[00:34:53.700 --> 00:34:55.820]   The award-winning online meeting service
[00:34:55.820 --> 00:34:59.780]   that we personally hear at TwitU's all the time for our meetings,
[00:34:59.780 --> 00:35:01.140]   even before HD Faces.
[00:35:01.140 --> 00:35:04.180]   But now-- whoa, whoa.
[00:35:04.180 --> 00:35:06.340]   HD Faces just brings this whole thing to life.
[00:35:06.340 --> 00:35:12.980]   Go to Meeting has added video to their already super high-quality
[00:35:12.980 --> 00:35:14.700]   screen sharing.
[00:35:14.700 --> 00:35:16.380]   And let me tell you, the quality of the video
[00:35:16.380 --> 00:35:18.260]   is so crystal clear.
[00:35:18.260 --> 00:35:20.780]   All you need is an internet connection and a camera.
[00:35:20.780 --> 00:35:22.540]   And you're going to get-- this is what it looks like.
[00:35:22.540 --> 00:35:24.540]   You have the screen sharing below.
[00:35:24.540 --> 00:35:26.620]   And then people, your attendees faces above.
[00:35:26.620 --> 00:35:29.780]   Just seeing somebody's nod or smile or grimace,
[00:35:29.780 --> 00:35:32.620]   seeing them fold their arms, it makes negotiations easier,
[00:35:32.620 --> 00:35:36.660]   makes sales easier, makes training easier.
[00:35:36.660 --> 00:35:38.500]   They've won about every award for web conferencing
[00:35:38.500 --> 00:35:40.380]   in the industry now that they've got HD Faces, I think,
[00:35:40.380 --> 00:35:43.260]   is just a killer, killer app.
[00:35:43.260 --> 00:35:45.020]   The new customers say, go to Meeting.
[00:35:45.020 --> 00:35:47.500]   I'm giving you some quotes here from emails received.
[00:35:47.500 --> 00:35:50.220]   Simple and smart, dynamic.
[00:35:50.220 --> 00:35:52.180]   So happy we switched.
[00:35:52.180 --> 00:35:54.940]   You can switch to for Mac or PC, absolutely free
[00:35:54.940 --> 00:35:56.700]   for the next 30 days.
[00:35:56.700 --> 00:36:01.940]   If you visit go2meeting.com right here, go to Meeting.com.
[00:36:01.940 --> 00:36:04.460]   Click that orange try-it free button.
[00:36:04.460 --> 00:36:08.700]   And the offer code for Mac Break Weekly is just Mac Break.
[00:36:08.700 --> 00:36:11.340]   So do put that in though, because then we'll get credit.
[00:36:11.340 --> 00:36:13.220]   And those guys over at Twit won't.
[00:36:13.220 --> 00:36:16.260]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:36:16.260 --> 00:36:18.940]   I have to say, as we were getting ready for Dreamforce,
[00:36:18.940 --> 00:36:19.700]   I think I used--
[00:36:19.700 --> 00:36:20.900]   I bet you did a lot of these.
[00:36:20.900 --> 00:36:21.860]   I did a lot of go2meeting.
[00:36:21.860 --> 00:36:24.780]   I did a lot from a lot of other unnamed ones that will lay out.
[00:36:24.780 --> 00:36:27.340]   And it was clear how much better the go2meeting in--
[00:36:27.340 --> 00:36:29.100]   Not to mention, it was affordable.
[00:36:29.100 --> 00:36:31.420]   I mean, it's $49 including the video a month.
[00:36:31.420 --> 00:36:31.940]   It's great.
[00:36:31.940 --> 00:36:34.100]   And some of these other guys, tens of thousands of dollars.
[00:36:34.100 --> 00:36:35.340]   And they were not as good.
[00:36:35.340 --> 00:36:36.180]   And they're not as good.
[00:36:36.180 --> 00:36:37.820]   I was like, you know, you really--
[00:36:37.820 --> 00:36:39.580]   I can get you an offer code.
[00:36:39.580 --> 00:36:41.180]   Well, you have these--
[00:36:41.180 --> 00:36:44.380]   For so many years, you had dedicating hardware and software
[00:36:44.380 --> 00:36:46.900]   in meeting rooms for telepresence.
[00:36:46.900 --> 00:36:48.420]   And now with computers--
[00:36:48.420 --> 00:36:49.860]   the go2meeting was kind of smart.
[00:36:49.860 --> 00:36:51.860]   They said, well, we're going to kind of avoid the hardware
[00:36:51.860 --> 00:36:53.100]   thing to be all software.
[00:36:53.100 --> 00:36:54.940]   Because as computers and cameras get better,
[00:36:54.940 --> 00:36:56.220]   we're going to get better and better.
[00:36:56.220 --> 00:36:59.060]   And in fact, that's where they've really benefited now.
[00:36:59.060 --> 00:37:02.980]   Every laptop now has a great HD camera built into it.
[00:37:02.980 --> 00:37:05.700]   And if you don't, it's $50 to buy the Logitech.
[00:37:05.700 --> 00:37:06.020]   What is it?
[00:37:06.020 --> 00:37:07.540]   C510 is the one we like.
[00:37:07.540 --> 00:37:09.380]   And it looks fantastic.
[00:37:09.380 --> 00:37:10.580]   Anyway, enough of that.
[00:37:10.580 --> 00:37:12.540]   Go to meaning.com.
[00:37:12.540 --> 00:37:13.140]   Try it today.
[00:37:13.140 --> 00:37:18.940]   Use the offer code Mac break so that we get credit for it.
[00:37:18.940 --> 00:37:21.620]   Andy Rubin--
[00:37:21.620 --> 00:37:22.780]   I like this.
[00:37:22.780 --> 00:37:26.420]   This is another one of those impotent things, right?
[00:37:26.420 --> 00:37:30.380]   This is according to Apple.
[00:37:30.380 --> 00:37:33.660]   Apple is, of course, getting the ITC
[00:37:33.660 --> 00:37:36.900]   to investigate the Samsung thing, the Android thing.
[00:37:36.900 --> 00:37:40.620]   And actually, this is now against HTC.
[00:37:40.620 --> 00:37:43.620]   And according to Apple, Andy Rubin,
[00:37:43.620 --> 00:37:47.140]   the guy who runs Android for Google--
[00:37:47.140 --> 00:37:50.020]   and by the way, who started at Apple--
[00:37:50.020 --> 00:37:52.340]   admits--
[00:37:52.340 --> 00:37:55.820]   here, I'll read from Apple's filing.
[00:37:55.820 --> 00:37:58.780]   Mr. Rubin began his career at Apple in the early 1990s
[00:37:58.780 --> 00:38:01.420]   and worked as a low-level engineer.
[00:38:01.420 --> 00:38:03.580]   Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[00:38:03.580 --> 00:38:07.220]   And at the exact time, the inventors of the 263 real-time
[00:38:07.220 --> 00:38:10.460]   API patent was being conceived and developed.
[00:38:10.460 --> 00:38:13.220]   They said he actually was there while that patent was being
[00:38:13.220 --> 00:38:14.380]   developed.
[00:38:14.380 --> 00:38:17.460]   It's thus no wonder that the infringing Android platform
[00:38:17.460 --> 00:38:20.500]   used the claim subsystem approach of the 263 patent
[00:38:20.500 --> 00:38:22.060]   that allows for flexibility of design
[00:38:22.060 --> 00:38:23.860]   and enables the platform to be highly customizable
[00:38:23.860 --> 00:38:27.420]   and expandable as HTC touts.
[00:38:27.420 --> 00:38:30.100]   But if I'm the judge reading this, that's--
[00:38:30.100 --> 00:38:33.420]   [HUMMING]
[00:38:33.420 --> 00:38:37.180]   And what they're really saying is that Android and Andy Rubin
[00:38:37.180 --> 00:38:39.540]   didn't start thinking about Android at General Magic, which
[00:38:39.540 --> 00:38:42.180]   he left Apple to go to found, or danger.
[00:38:42.180 --> 00:38:46.380]   But in fact, at Apple--
[00:38:46.380 --> 00:38:50.180]   so a very interesting factoid.
[00:38:50.180 --> 00:38:54.700]   I didn't realize Andy Rubin worked at Apple that long ago.
[00:38:54.700 --> 00:38:57.180]   And in fact, worked in an area where he would have had access
[00:38:57.180 --> 00:39:00.380]   to this real-time API that they're soon over,
[00:39:00.380 --> 00:39:01.740]   HTC over.
[00:39:01.740 --> 00:39:04.620]   This one's pretty compelling.
[00:39:04.620 --> 00:39:10.180]   I would wonder now, Apple's not suing Google yet.
[00:39:10.180 --> 00:39:12.580]   Yet.
[00:39:12.580 --> 00:39:15.860]   But this article that I'm reading from FOSS patents, which
[00:39:15.860 --> 00:39:18.220]   is a blog that covers software patent news,
[00:39:18.220 --> 00:39:19.060]   makes a good point.
[00:39:19.060 --> 00:39:23.020]   If Apple sued Google directly over this 263 patent,
[00:39:23.020 --> 00:39:28.580]   there could be an injunction against Android sales.
[00:39:28.580 --> 00:39:29.260]   And this is really--
[00:39:29.260 --> 00:39:32.580]   I mean, I think this is probably a great subject for Twill.
[00:39:32.580 --> 00:39:34.900]   Yeah, and I'm sure Denise will be covering it.
[00:39:34.900 --> 00:39:37.380]   Because I think that the issue is that the only thing I can
[00:39:37.380 --> 00:39:39.300]   think of is why you wouldn't sue Google directly
[00:39:39.300 --> 00:39:41.420]   as you start building up a bit of case--
[00:39:41.420 --> 00:39:43.140]   Well, here's an interesting thing.
[00:39:43.140 --> 00:39:47.940]   Apple has sued Motorola over the 263 patent.
[00:39:47.940 --> 00:39:51.820]   So this gets even more complicated
[00:39:51.820 --> 00:39:55.020]   with the potential Google acquisition of a Motorola.
[00:39:56.020 --> 00:39:59.260]   Mm.
[00:39:59.260 --> 00:40:01.700]   If ITC, according to this FOSS patents,
[00:40:01.700 --> 00:40:04.580]   this is Florian Mueller's IP blog.
[00:40:04.580 --> 00:40:07.500]   If the ITC upholds the initial determination
[00:40:07.500 --> 00:40:09.780]   that the patent is valid and infringed by Android,
[00:40:09.780 --> 00:40:12.620]   Google should be very concerned.
[00:40:12.620 --> 00:40:15.180]   An ITC decision doesn't bind the federal courts,
[00:40:15.180 --> 00:40:16.780]   but the likelihood of Apple being
[00:40:16.780 --> 00:40:21.340]   able to enforce this patent and thereby have Andy Rubin declared
[00:40:21.340 --> 00:40:23.620]   a willful infringer of a patent developed at Apple
[00:40:23.620 --> 00:40:26.020]   while he worked there by the people he worked for
[00:40:26.020 --> 00:40:28.860]   would be considerably greater if the ITC does
[00:40:28.860 --> 00:40:31.020]   decide against Andy Rubin.
[00:40:31.020 --> 00:40:32.260]   That's very interesting.
[00:40:32.260 --> 00:40:36.540]   That's quite an accusation.
[00:40:36.540 --> 00:40:39.940]   I'm not a big patent.
[00:40:39.940 --> 00:40:44.460]   I don't like patent law as a co-regardance software,
[00:40:44.460 --> 00:40:46.140]   but then I've seen this case.
[00:40:46.140 --> 00:40:47.580]   You almost became a patent lawyer.
[00:40:47.580 --> 00:40:48.340]   Did you really?
[00:40:48.340 --> 00:40:49.180]   I was thinking about--
[00:40:49.180 --> 00:40:49.740]   You missed your shot.
[00:40:49.740 --> 00:40:50.980]   You could have been rich by now.
[00:40:50.980 --> 00:40:53.180]   I just don't like reading that much.
[00:40:53.180 --> 00:40:57.020]   Just like Elligold, we've said this before.
[00:40:57.020 --> 00:40:57.700]   I was like, no.
[00:40:57.700 --> 00:41:02.300]   Listen to this American life show on patent, software patents.
[00:41:02.300 --> 00:41:05.500]   It's really, really good, and it will turn you
[00:41:05.500 --> 00:41:08.780]   beat red with indignation.
[00:41:08.780 --> 00:41:11.300]   Now, speaking of indignation, I'm not thrilled about this.
[00:41:11.300 --> 00:41:17.820]   Apple got the German authorities to pull the Samsung Galaxy
[00:41:17.820 --> 00:41:23.260]   tab from the trade show, the EFA trade show.
[00:41:23.260 --> 00:41:28.740]   Samsung was about to show its new 7.7-inch Galaxy tab.
[00:41:28.740 --> 00:41:31.300]   And all the samples were removed from view
[00:41:31.300 --> 00:41:33.100]   and out of reach of public impress.
[00:41:33.100 --> 00:41:36.740]   The posters and insignia were stripped out of their booths.
[00:41:36.740 --> 00:41:42.140]   Even though they had a sign on it that said not for sale
[00:41:42.140 --> 00:41:44.340]   in Germany because, of course, it isn't for sale in Germany
[00:41:44.340 --> 00:41:47.780]   because Samsung is subject to an injunction issued in Germany.
[00:41:47.780 --> 00:41:52.540]   Perhibiting it from selling the Galaxy tab due to a similarity
[00:41:52.540 --> 00:41:54.100]   with Apple.
[00:41:54.100 --> 00:41:56.860]   Apple did get a second injunction from a Dusseldorf court
[00:41:56.860 --> 00:41:59.340]   on September 2nd blocking the sales and promotion of the Galaxy
[00:41:59.340 --> 00:42:01.180]   tab 7.7.
[00:42:01.180 --> 00:42:04.860]   And because of this injunction, Apple's PR people,
[00:42:04.860 --> 00:42:12.580]   maybe that same Tony went to the booth and said, give me that.
[00:42:12.580 --> 00:42:14.740]   I'll give you 300 bucks for that poster.
[00:42:14.740 --> 00:42:16.780]   You're saying that Apple has its own Luca Prozzi.
[00:42:16.780 --> 00:42:20.980]   It is kind of take the tab, leave the cannoli.
[00:42:20.980 --> 00:42:23.780]   Wow.
[00:42:23.780 --> 00:42:25.340]   I can't think of this happening before.
[00:42:25.340 --> 00:42:30.500]   Police should go to a trade show floor and say, get rid of that.
[00:42:30.500 --> 00:42:32.340]   You can't show that.
[00:42:32.340 --> 00:42:35.900]   It makes you wonder a little bit what Apple's end game
[00:42:35.900 --> 00:42:37.940]   and all this patent stuff is.
[00:42:37.940 --> 00:42:41.460]   Is it to actually prevent these devices from being sold
[00:42:41.460 --> 00:42:44.260]   or is it to simply negotiate a license fee per unit
[00:42:44.260 --> 00:42:47.340]   so that Android is free to be as successful as they want to do
[00:42:47.340 --> 00:42:50.980]   so long as they sold Apple gets 5 or 10 bucks.
[00:42:50.980 --> 00:42:52.020]   They're playing hardball.
[00:42:52.020 --> 00:42:53.180]   I mean, there's no question about that.
[00:42:53.180 --> 00:42:57.620]   I mean, even that would be a huge win, not just for the 5 or 10 bucks
[00:42:57.620 --> 00:42:57.980]   they get.
[00:42:57.980 --> 00:43:01.700]   I think that Apple would want that sort of victory just to put
[00:43:01.700 --> 00:43:05.580]   another $5 or $10 into the unit cost of every single Android device.
[00:43:05.580 --> 00:43:06.820]   Well, Microsoft very did remember.
[00:43:06.820 --> 00:43:09.220]   Microsoft gets 5 or 10 bucks for every Android phone.
[00:43:09.220 --> 00:43:11.860]   I don't think Apple has any interest in licensing fees.
[00:43:11.860 --> 00:43:13.500]   I think that what they want to do is...
[00:43:13.500 --> 00:43:14.740]   I don't even think they need to kill it.
[00:43:14.740 --> 00:43:15.820]   I think they just want to trip it up.
[00:43:15.820 --> 00:43:20.100]   They just want to stall it while the iPad continues to move forward.
[00:43:20.100 --> 00:43:27.140]   It's ironic because it's like when a football team's winning 45 to nothing
[00:43:27.140 --> 00:43:28.940]   to score that extra touchdown.
[00:43:28.940 --> 00:43:30.660]   Apple lost this game before in the 80s.
[00:43:30.660 --> 00:43:33.620]   I think they have a history of things getting caught up.
[00:43:33.620 --> 00:43:36.980]   So I think the issue that they have is they have the next platform.
[00:43:36.980 --> 00:43:41.100]   I mean, the iPad, they have the best hardware from your pocket
[00:43:41.100 --> 00:43:43.220]   to the trucks, quote unquote.
[00:43:43.220 --> 00:43:45.220]   You know, out there right now, people are buying their...
[00:43:45.220 --> 00:43:46.220]   They own it.
[00:43:46.220 --> 00:43:49.020]   They're buying these little computers that are a little 11-inch.
[00:43:49.020 --> 00:43:49.540]   Right.
[00:43:49.540 --> 00:43:51.100]   You know, up to the Mac mini-
[00:43:51.100 --> 00:43:52.860]   Half a million units a month.
[00:43:52.860 --> 00:43:54.460]   Yeah, the iMacs, everything.
[00:43:54.460 --> 00:43:56.420]   They're hitting on all cylinders.
[00:43:56.420 --> 00:44:00.700]   And the thing is, is that nobody else is able to catch up the closest thing to it
[00:44:00.700 --> 00:44:03.020]   are these Galaxy, you know, these Galaxy tabs.
[00:44:03.020 --> 00:44:04.820]   Well, and I don't know if they're selling that one.
[00:44:04.820 --> 00:44:08.180]   You know, we saw some sales figures for the first 7-inch Galaxy tab
[00:44:08.180 --> 00:44:12.220]   and they said out of a million made, they were only able to push maybe a couple hundred thousand.
[00:44:12.220 --> 00:44:15.420]   You know, the question is, is all this uncertainty that Apple's creating around the patents,
[00:44:15.420 --> 00:44:18.220]   around all the other pieces, are they going to be continued to be supported?
[00:44:18.220 --> 00:44:19.340]   Are they going to be sold?
[00:44:19.340 --> 00:44:20.500]   I think affects sales.
[00:44:20.500 --> 00:44:21.500]   And I think it's...
[00:44:21.500 --> 00:44:22.500]   Ah, it's a good point.
[00:44:22.500 --> 00:44:23.500]   So the thing is, is that people are kind of in a...
[00:44:23.500 --> 00:44:25.500]   I'm not sure if I should buy into this right now,
[00:44:25.500 --> 00:44:27.140]   because I'm not sure if it's still going to be around.
[00:44:27.140 --> 00:44:28.500]   It's like if you've stomped on a snake,
[00:44:28.500 --> 00:44:30.420]   you want to cut off its head, too, just in case.
[00:44:30.420 --> 00:44:30.860]   Exactly.
[00:44:30.860 --> 00:44:34.340]   Well, and the thing is, is that I think that Apple...
[00:44:34.340 --> 00:44:35.780]   I think it makes...
[00:44:35.780 --> 00:44:37.060]   I'm not saying I necessarily agree with it,
[00:44:37.060 --> 00:44:40.980]   but I do think that Apple had, you know, just stalling people so that it can get far enough ahead.
[00:44:40.980 --> 00:44:45.780]   And then you end up in an iPod situation where it becomes more and more difficult to catch up.
[00:44:45.780 --> 00:44:46.300]   Right.
[00:44:46.300 --> 00:44:49.460]   You know, once you get it, once you fall, sitting this behind, you know,
[00:44:49.460 --> 00:44:55.700]   Apple reaches critical mass and right now, I think it gets harder and harder for other companies to catch up.
[00:44:55.700 --> 00:44:58.140]   And this, as we've said, this lawsuit is global.
[00:44:58.140 --> 00:44:59.500]   I mean, this one's a German court.
[00:44:59.500 --> 00:45:01.260]   Of course, they're suing worldwide.
[00:45:01.260 --> 00:45:05.540]   In Australia, a judge in Australian federal court said,
[00:45:05.540 --> 00:45:10.100]   "Apple isn't presenting enough evidence to justify an injunction against Samsung's tablet.
[00:45:10.100 --> 00:45:16.420]   In Australia, so she says, 'I need to see sales data.
[00:45:16.420 --> 00:45:22.260]   You have to show me that the iPad's sales have been hurt by Samsung's devices.'
[00:45:22.260 --> 00:45:24.900]   Then this must be something unique to Australian law, again,
[00:45:24.900 --> 00:45:26.540]   and there's a question for Denise Howell.
[00:45:26.540 --> 00:45:29.540]   But I don't believe that you have to prove that, do you?
[00:45:29.540 --> 00:45:30.940]   I think you have to prove damages.
[00:45:30.940 --> 00:45:32.300]   There's damages.
[00:45:32.300 --> 00:45:33.820]   Okay.
[00:45:33.820 --> 00:45:35.420]   That's another Denise question to me, but I...
[00:45:35.420 --> 00:45:40.140]   Apple claims that Samsung's device illegally copies the iPad and should not be offered for sale.
[00:45:40.140 --> 00:45:45.420]   I would think just, you know, trade dress infringement and patent infringement would be enough to halt it.
[00:45:45.420 --> 00:45:46.540]   You don't have to say...
[00:45:46.540 --> 00:45:50.940]   I mean, if I steal, you know, your shirt design and make your shirt,
[00:45:50.940 --> 00:45:54.380]   you don't have to prove that it's costing me sales if you stole the design.
[00:45:54.380 --> 00:45:55.140]   Right.
[00:45:55.140 --> 00:45:55.940]   So I'm not sure...
[00:45:55.940 --> 00:45:58.140]   It depends, I guess, what Apple is...
[00:45:58.140 --> 00:45:59.900]   Is suing over.
[00:45:59.900 --> 00:46:00.740]   I guess...
[00:46:00.740 --> 00:46:01.460]   I guess Apple...
[00:46:01.460 --> 00:46:02.340]   Apparently, this is the case.
[00:46:02.340 --> 00:46:04.740]   Now, I'm looking a little further down in the CNET article.
[00:46:04.740 --> 00:46:10.180]   A key point in Apple's argument is that Samsung's allegedly infringing devices hurting iPad sales.
[00:46:10.180 --> 00:46:11.780]   Samsung denies it.
[00:46:11.780 --> 00:46:13.500]   Yeah, that's ridiculous.
[00:46:13.500 --> 00:46:14.460]   Yeah, I can't.
[00:46:14.460 --> 00:46:15.300]   Apple...
[00:46:15.300 --> 00:46:19.060]   That's just filling out part of the paper that you're typing on when you're calling it.
[00:46:19.060 --> 00:46:24.380]   And not only that, they're meaning meanie stinky faces and they're hurting our sales.
[00:46:24.380 --> 00:46:25.500]   Um...
[00:46:25.500 --> 00:46:28.060]   I think it's hard to figure what they're doing here.
[00:46:28.060 --> 00:46:29.180]   Part of it is...
[00:46:29.180 --> 00:46:31.340]   It's possible that they're just doing...
[00:46:31.340 --> 00:46:32.940]   They're acting out on principle,
[00:46:32.940 --> 00:46:36.260]   saying that we have a goldmine here, that goldmine could...
[00:46:36.260 --> 00:46:40.180]   Our lead could evaporate over the next four or five years, just in principle, if we see
[00:46:40.180 --> 00:46:46.140]   weakness on another product, or their legal defense, we're going to go after it.
[00:46:46.140 --> 00:46:49.540]   If they're actually trying to do something actually quite tactical, which is to say,
[00:46:49.540 --> 00:46:53.500]   we fear the seven-inch new version of the Galaxy tab, we want to keep it off the market
[00:46:53.500 --> 00:46:54.500]   as long as possible.
[00:46:54.500 --> 00:46:55.500]   But do they really need to fear it?
[00:46:55.500 --> 00:46:56.500]   That makes no sense.
[00:46:56.500 --> 00:46:57.500]   Right.
[00:46:57.500 --> 00:46:58.500]   I don't think...
[00:46:58.500 --> 00:47:01.980]   In fact, Apple's sales, iPad sales, up 183%.
[00:47:01.980 --> 00:47:06.980]   And for third quarter, Q3 over 2010.
[00:47:06.980 --> 00:47:10.180]   But apparently Apple's making the argument that the tablet's killing us.
[00:47:10.180 --> 00:47:11.180]   And I think that there is some...
[00:47:11.180 --> 00:47:16.220]   I mean, I would hope to say that this is not personal, but I think there is an incredible
[00:47:16.220 --> 00:47:19.540]   amount of bitterness from Steve Jobs.
[00:47:19.540 --> 00:47:20.540]   Feels like it.
[00:47:20.540 --> 00:47:25.020]   He saw Google as a partner and he saw them in Croach on his face.
[00:47:25.020 --> 00:47:26.020]   And I would not...
[00:47:26.020 --> 00:47:28.380]   I think that some of this may be personal.
[00:47:28.380 --> 00:47:33.380]   We're going to hit you in every gun that we have at every moment because you came into
[00:47:33.380 --> 00:47:36.100]   our space when we partnered with you.
[00:47:36.100 --> 00:47:37.100]   Wow.
[00:47:37.100 --> 00:47:41.940]   I have to say that if I got into a partnership with a company and they did what Google did,
[00:47:41.940 --> 00:47:43.540]   I would expend...
[00:47:43.540 --> 00:47:44.540]   I had the money that Apple had.
[00:47:44.540 --> 00:47:45.540]   Well, what did Google do?
[00:47:45.540 --> 00:47:46.540]   I would slip every switch.
[00:47:46.540 --> 00:47:47.540]   Yeah, but what did Google do?
[00:47:47.540 --> 00:47:50.540]   Because they partnered and they started partnering with how they're going to be incorporated into
[00:47:50.540 --> 00:47:52.580]   the phone and they had Google Maps on there.
[00:47:52.580 --> 00:47:55.100]   And they're working on how they could be integrated.
[00:47:55.100 --> 00:47:57.260]   And they were working together on all of this stuff.
[00:47:57.260 --> 00:47:58.260]   And Apple had the impression...
[00:47:58.260 --> 00:48:03.580]   This is old news, but Apple has the impression that they're partnering up with Google, building
[00:48:03.580 --> 00:48:06.140]   up all those pieces, and then Google opens their own phone.
[00:48:06.140 --> 00:48:09.780]   And I have to admit, I'm kind of one of those people that I would spend every dime that
[00:48:09.780 --> 00:48:12.140]   I needed to pound them at every moment.
[00:48:12.140 --> 00:48:14.100]   Their phone was in development before Apple's...
[00:48:14.100 --> 00:48:16.340]   They should have talked to Apple about that.
[00:48:16.340 --> 00:48:17.340]   They didn't talk to Apple.
[00:48:17.340 --> 00:48:18.340]   They kind of talked to them.
[00:48:18.340 --> 00:48:22.860]   Yeah, I have a discussion with some people on Google+, I've read posts and something about
[00:48:22.860 --> 00:48:23.860]   this.
[00:48:23.860 --> 00:48:28.420]   Oh, well, Android was being built well before the iPhone.
[00:48:28.420 --> 00:48:31.940]   But they were showing up prototypes that made it look like a blackberry.
[00:48:31.940 --> 00:48:36.540]   You can really just draw a very sharp line between, "This is what the Android prototypes
[00:48:36.540 --> 00:48:39.780]   look like before the iPhone was shown up.
[00:48:39.780 --> 00:48:42.500]   This is what they all looked like after that."
[00:48:42.500 --> 00:48:46.700]   But yeah, I think you might have a point there, Alex, because remember, there was that famous
[00:48:46.700 --> 00:48:49.100]   line from, was it a year and a half, two years ago?
[00:48:49.100 --> 00:48:54.460]   I got out that Steve Jobs was talking to employees and described Google point, I guess, out to
[00:48:54.460 --> 00:48:56.940]   kill Apple and out to kill the iPhone.
[00:48:56.940 --> 00:49:01.260]   So, that could basically put them into, you know, Warriors 3 mode.
[00:49:01.260 --> 00:49:03.980]   He's not looking at thinking that.
[00:49:03.980 --> 00:49:09.060]   Paul Theradit, at Windows Weekly, continually says that Google is dumping Android.
[00:49:09.060 --> 00:49:12.340]   They're giving Android away the same, much the same as Microsoft itself, dumped Internet
[00:49:12.340 --> 00:49:14.940]   Explorer, gave it away for free to kill Netscape.
[00:49:14.940 --> 00:49:19.540]   Android is being dumped by Google to corner the market on smartphones.
[00:49:19.540 --> 00:49:20.700]   Do you believe that's the case?
[00:49:20.700 --> 00:49:22.260]   I think Microsoft does.
[00:49:22.260 --> 00:49:26.300]   I think it's a valid argument that that is the direction that they're going.
[00:49:26.300 --> 00:49:28.700]   And I think that if I would Google, I would do the same thing.
[00:49:28.700 --> 00:49:33.620]   It's just that if I were, you know, but I do think that they played dirty pool with Apple
[00:49:33.620 --> 00:49:34.620]   early on.
[00:49:34.620 --> 00:49:36.620]   And Steve Jobs is not someone to do that with.
[00:49:36.620 --> 00:49:40.940]   You know, because you know, and that's the, and I think that what they're paying for now
[00:49:40.940 --> 00:49:45.500]   is that Apple will use every gun in their arsenal to attack them.
[00:49:45.500 --> 00:49:48.220]   You know, and they're going to continue to go down this path.
[00:49:48.220 --> 00:49:51.700]   And I think it may end up killing Android because I think that they probably have some
[00:49:51.700 --> 00:49:57.260]   patent stuff that if, you know, that is probably going to eventually cause massive damage to
[00:49:57.260 --> 00:49:58.260]   their outcome.
[00:49:58.260 --> 00:50:02.140]   I honestly think that Android has already wandered into the tar pit.
[00:50:02.140 --> 00:50:06.660]   And now it's up to them to either get themselves out of that tar pit or become a museum exhibit
[00:50:06.660 --> 00:50:09.100]   and 50 to 60 to 70,000 years.
[00:50:09.100 --> 00:50:12.420]   Because I was at what brand tar pits just this weekend.
[00:50:12.420 --> 00:50:13.420]   Yeah.
[00:50:13.420 --> 00:50:14.900]   They rescue that adorable little squirrel.
[00:50:14.900 --> 00:50:15.900]   Wasn't that good?
[00:50:15.900 --> 00:50:16.900]   Yeah.
[00:50:16.900 --> 00:50:17.900]   But that's a side issue.
[00:50:17.900 --> 00:50:21.460]   Just don't want to go down, go down a squirrel hole.
[00:50:21.460 --> 00:50:27.860]   But it, company after company is now just being very, very deliberate about forking,
[00:50:27.860 --> 00:50:32.380]   forking Android that there's, when you look at the, when you look at the adoption of Android
[00:50:32.380 --> 00:50:36.660]   3.0, it's a very, very weak part of the graph.
[00:50:36.660 --> 00:50:38.740]   And now there are two different companies who said, you know what?
[00:50:38.740 --> 00:50:41.340]   I know that we, we were backing Android to begin with.
[00:50:41.340 --> 00:50:45.460]   We decided that we're going to take the, your, your lovely V8 engine, but we're going to
[00:50:45.460 --> 00:50:46.860]   build something brand new around it.
[00:50:46.860 --> 00:50:51.660]   We're going to take the very, very core of Android, but our hope is to build a tablet
[00:50:51.660 --> 00:50:56.300]   or a device or phone around it that makes people not even aware that there is anything
[00:50:56.300 --> 00:50:57.300]   Android going in.
[00:50:57.300 --> 00:50:58.900]   We want to have our own app store.
[00:50:58.900 --> 00:51:00.980]   We won't, we want to have our own UI.
[00:51:00.980 --> 00:51:04.660]   This has been a steady progress for the, the process for the past year and a half.
[00:51:04.660 --> 00:51:10.020]   I think that Google is really in the point where they can have, they can have 80% of
[00:51:10.020 --> 00:51:15.140]   the market share eventually, but no value of that market share because no consumer will
[00:51:15.140 --> 00:51:17.940]   ever walk into a store and say, give me an Android phone.
[00:51:17.940 --> 00:51:21.580]   I've heard that Android is a really, Google Android is a really great operating system.
[00:51:21.580 --> 00:51:22.580]   No.
[00:51:22.580 --> 00:51:23.580]   Yeah.
[00:51:23.580 --> 00:51:24.580]   I think it's changing a little bit.
[00:51:24.580 --> 00:51:25.580]   I hearing that more and more.
[00:51:25.580 --> 00:51:29.100]   Um, actually from people, people call the radio show.
[00:51:29.100 --> 00:51:35.900]   I use the radio show as a barometer of normal people and, and their feelings.
[00:51:35.900 --> 00:51:36.900]   And you're right.
[00:51:36.900 --> 00:51:40.020]   I mean, in fact, I even say to a lot of these people, this can get an iPhone, this can
[00:51:40.020 --> 00:51:43.220]   happen, but more and more people, normal people are calling up saying, I really want
[00:51:43.220 --> 00:51:44.220]   an Android phone.
[00:51:44.220 --> 00:51:45.220]   No, I don't want an iPhone.
[00:51:45.220 --> 00:51:46.220]   I really want an Android phone.
[00:51:46.220 --> 00:51:51.540]   So there's some, there's some shift going on, obviously with 550,000 activations a day,
[00:51:51.540 --> 00:51:54.140]   somebody's buying this stuff and it's more than just price.
[00:51:54.140 --> 00:51:56.060]   I don't think it's like an also ran.
[00:51:56.060 --> 00:51:57.060]   I think you can.
[00:51:57.060 --> 00:51:59.060]   If that's fair to say that anymore.
[00:51:59.060 --> 00:52:00.980]   I see I'm, I'm not sure.
[00:52:00.980 --> 00:52:07.100]   If you put, if I were to put three different phones, I put an HTC phone, a, a HTC phone,
[00:52:07.100 --> 00:52:13.540]   a Samsung phone and let's say a, a, a NUC e-book reader, would people have any awareness
[00:52:13.540 --> 00:52:16.140]   that there is shared DNA between these three things?
[00:52:16.140 --> 00:52:21.100]   If someone became really, really comfortable with their HTC branded Android phone, if
[00:52:21.100 --> 00:52:25.740]   they were to have to deal with a Samsung phone for the next three or four days, how long
[00:52:25.740 --> 00:52:29.420]   would it take them to get used to all the differences in UI and all the differences
[00:52:29.420 --> 00:52:32.180]   between where the apps are and how things operate?
[00:52:32.180 --> 00:52:34.580]   I really think that Android has a huge, huge problem.
[00:52:34.580 --> 00:52:40.300]   I think this is a case study and the idea that open is great, but when you decide deliberately
[00:52:40.300 --> 00:52:45.180]   to make an operating system or software open, you are explicitly saying, I don't care if
[00:52:45.180 --> 00:52:51.500]   I have any say in the direction of this thing going forward because success will never,
[00:52:51.500 --> 00:52:55.460]   ever, ever equate to your greater control over this part of the market.
[00:52:55.460 --> 00:52:59.860]   It will always mean that you can, and on, on your obituary, the first paragraph will
[00:52:59.860 --> 00:53:04.740]   say he wrote the core code of Android that powers over 93% of all handsets, but it will
[00:53:04.740 --> 00:53:09.260]   not translate into more power.
[00:53:09.260 --> 00:53:11.180]   I want to take a little break when we come back.
[00:53:11.180 --> 00:53:16.540]   I'm just going to throw this rumor at you guys and see and let you shoot it down.
[00:53:16.540 --> 00:53:17.540]   I believe it.
[00:53:17.540 --> 00:53:18.540]   I endorse it 100%.
[00:53:18.540 --> 00:53:20.700]   I don't believe it.
[00:53:20.700 --> 00:53:22.180]   I just, I think it's crazy.
[00:53:22.180 --> 00:53:28.220]   It keeps coming up and my friend Cedric Ingrand, who is out here from France, he does a very
[00:53:28.220 --> 00:53:32.020]   good TV show about technology in France on a TCI called Planet Crenn.
[00:53:32.020 --> 00:53:33.340]   He was on Twitter this week.
[00:53:33.340 --> 00:53:38.980]   He said, I'm thinking I should come back as soon as the Apple invites go out.
[00:53:38.980 --> 00:53:43.300]   Not because he's interested in the next iPhone, of course he is, but he says, I think, A,
[00:53:43.300 --> 00:53:46.820]   this will be Steve's last appearance, and I think he's going to come out for one more
[00:53:46.820 --> 00:53:52.540]   thing and I think all evidence points to it being an Apple television.
[00:53:52.540 --> 00:53:54.580]   Let's find out what the panel thinks.
[00:53:54.580 --> 00:53:55.580]   Andy in a bit.
[00:53:55.580 --> 00:54:00.460]   Andy Inakos here from the Chicago Sun Times, Alex Lindsey from the Pixel Core, and I'm
[00:54:00.460 --> 00:54:05.060]   giving you time to compose your thoughts, gentlemen.
[00:54:05.060 --> 00:54:07.820]   What we talk about, carbonite.com.
[00:54:07.820 --> 00:54:09.580]   Backup done right.
[00:54:09.580 --> 00:54:11.580]   I'm a carbonite fan.
[00:54:11.580 --> 00:54:16.380]   In fact, so much so that when Abby went to college or freshman year last year, and of
[00:54:16.380 --> 00:54:22.260]   course with a fresh brand new MacBook, 13-inch MacBook, now I would send her with an air,
[00:54:22.260 --> 00:54:27.740]   but at the time I send her with a 13-inch MacBook because the air hadn't come out yet.
[00:54:27.740 --> 00:54:29.500]   It was going to come out in October.
[00:54:29.500 --> 00:54:31.420]   Not that I bid her.
[00:54:31.420 --> 00:54:34.580]   She actually said, this year I want an air.
[00:54:34.580 --> 00:54:35.580]   Okay.
[00:54:35.580 --> 00:54:36.580]   But guess what?
[00:54:36.580 --> 00:54:40.500]   I'm going to have carbonite on it because I don't want to get that call.
[00:54:40.500 --> 00:54:43.420]   Daddy, I deleted my term paper.
[00:54:43.420 --> 00:54:48.420]   Is there any way to get it back?
[00:54:48.420 --> 00:54:53.420]   I want it to be ready for that, especially for a laptop.
[00:54:53.420 --> 00:54:57.420]   But just think about all the personal information you have on your hard drive.
[00:54:57.420 --> 00:54:59.420]   Is it backed up automatically?
[00:54:59.420 --> 00:55:00.420]   Is it safe?
[00:55:00.420 --> 00:55:01.420]   Is it on a hard drive right next to the computer?
[00:55:01.420 --> 00:55:04.420]   So if somebody comes and steals everything, they'll get that too.
[00:55:04.420 --> 00:55:05.420]   Or if there's a fire.
[00:55:05.420 --> 00:55:06.420]   Yeah, you've got it.
[00:55:06.420 --> 00:55:07.420]   I have two kids.
[00:55:07.420 --> 00:55:08.420]   Yeah.
[00:55:08.420 --> 00:55:09.420]   Two and four.
[00:55:09.420 --> 00:55:10.420]   Yeah.
[00:55:10.420 --> 00:55:11.420]   They'll destroy stuff.
[00:55:11.420 --> 00:55:12.420]   They'll destroy stuff.
[00:55:12.420 --> 00:55:13.420]   They'll destroy stuff.
[00:55:13.420 --> 00:55:18.420]   So if somebody comes and steals everything, they'll destroy stuff.
[00:55:18.420 --> 00:55:19.420]   They'll destroy stuff.
[00:55:19.420 --> 00:55:24.420]   So if somebody comes and steals everything, they'll destroy stuff.
[00:55:24.420 --> 00:55:28.420]   So if somebody comes and steals everything, they'll destroy stuff.
[00:55:28.420 --> 00:55:31.420]   So if somebody comes and steals everything, they'll destroy stuff.
[00:55:31.420 --> 00:55:36.420]   And so if somebody comes and steals everything, they'll destroy stuff.
[00:55:36.420 --> 00:55:43.420]   So if somebody comes and steals everything, they'll destroy stuff.
[00:55:43.420 --> 00:55:47.420]   So if somebody comes and steals everything, they'll destroy stuff.
[00:55:47.420 --> 00:55:50.420]   So if somebody comes and steals everything, they'll destroy stuff.
[00:55:50.420 --> 00:55:53.420]   So if somebody comes and steals everything, they'll destroy stuff.
[00:55:53.420 --> 00:55:56.420]   So if somebody comes and steals everything, they'll destroy stuff.
[00:55:56.420 --> 00:55:59.420]   So if somebody comes and steals everything, they'll destroy stuff.
[00:55:59.420 --> 00:56:03.420]   So if somebody comes and steals everything, they'll destroy stuff.
[00:56:03.420 --> 00:56:05.420]   You don't need a credit card.
[00:56:05.420 --> 00:56:07.420]   And by the way, this is the Carbonite Home.
[00:56:07.420 --> 00:56:09.420]   There's also a business product, but let's start with the Carbonite Home.
[00:56:09.420 --> 00:56:12.420]   Make sure you just in here, just right in here, you go.
[00:56:12.420 --> 00:56:13.420]   MACBREA.
[00:56:13.420 --> 00:56:14.420]   Oops.
[00:56:14.420 --> 00:56:15.420]   MACBREA.
[00:56:15.420 --> 00:56:16.420]   There you go.
[00:56:16.420 --> 00:56:18.420]   So now I can start my free trial.
[00:56:18.420 --> 00:56:20.420]   It is amazing.
[00:56:20.420 --> 00:56:23.420]   They do not, I have to warn you, they do not have lion support yet.
[00:56:23.420 --> 00:56:28.620]   This is, it's taken the people who do the low level file stuff a little longer to get that
[00:56:28.620 --> 00:56:29.820]   lion support out there.
[00:56:29.820 --> 00:56:32.420]   So if you're using lion, hold off a bit.
[00:56:32.420 --> 00:56:35.420]   I'm sure the next week or so we'll have an announcement for you.
[00:56:35.420 --> 00:56:43.460]   Meanwhile, XP Vista Windows 7 or any Intel based MAC from with OS, up to OS 10.6, 15 days
[00:56:43.460 --> 00:56:45.860]   free of Carbonite with the offer code MAC.
[00:56:45.860 --> 00:56:51.180]   And by the way, if you decide to buy, you can get 14 months for the price of 12 if you
[00:56:51.180 --> 00:56:52.780]   use the offer code MAC break again.
[00:56:52.780 --> 00:56:56.420]   Carbonite is just the best way to back it up.
[00:56:56.420 --> 00:56:57.420]   Got to back it up to get it back.
[00:56:57.420 --> 00:57:00.420]   So do it right with Carbonite.
[00:57:00.420 --> 00:57:03.820]   Oh, and did I mention that it's also offline storage.
[00:57:03.820 --> 00:57:08.420]   So you, if you have it backed up on Carbonite, you can, they have an iPhone and iPad app,
[00:57:08.420 --> 00:57:10.060]   BlackBerry and Android too.
[00:57:10.060 --> 00:57:12.900]   And of course on your computer, you log on to your Carbonite account with any device,
[00:57:12.900 --> 00:57:14.340]   there's all your stuff.
[00:57:14.340 --> 00:57:19.300]   So it's also offline or the cloud based storage unlimited.
[00:57:19.300 --> 00:57:20.540]   All right.
[00:57:20.540 --> 00:57:24.020]   So I have to say, I've really been thinking about this and I keep, we heard this rumor,
[00:57:24.020 --> 00:57:28.460]   I think it was Jason Calicana, who was the first two years ago to say Apple will be doing
[00:57:28.460 --> 00:57:29.580]   a television.
[00:57:29.580 --> 00:57:32.260]   So we keep hearing that rumor again and again and again.
[00:57:32.260 --> 00:57:33.820]   I don't get it.
[00:57:33.820 --> 00:57:35.660]   I don't think there's any reason.
[00:57:35.660 --> 00:57:40.820]   John Oegassay brought it up again this yesterday in his Monday letter.
[00:57:40.820 --> 00:57:45.820]   He's of course former Appleic president and the guy who did BOS knows a little bit about
[00:57:45.820 --> 00:57:46.820]   the business.
[00:57:46.820 --> 00:57:51.780]   He says, I have been very skeptical about this for several reasons.
[00:57:51.780 --> 00:57:55.300]   One, because TVs don't get updated as much as computers.
[00:57:55.300 --> 00:57:59.780]   Two, who's going to carry a 15 inch display to the Apple genius and say it's broken.
[00:57:59.780 --> 00:58:02.260]   Three, it's a difficult business in general.
[00:58:02.260 --> 00:58:06.020]   He says, but I just feel like it's about to happen.
[00:58:06.020 --> 00:58:09.540]   Andy, you think there's any, I guess, say has any merit in what he's saying at this
[00:58:09.540 --> 00:58:10.540]   point?
[00:58:10.540 --> 00:58:14.180]   It's just that there's so many analysts who are saying that they've heard this from so
[00:58:14.180 --> 00:58:16.740]   many sources that they've.
[00:58:16.740 --> 00:58:21.300]   It's the sketchiest kind of rumor and it's only getting any velocity by all the mass,
[00:58:21.300 --> 00:58:22.300]   so to speak.
[00:58:22.300 --> 00:58:23.300]   Right.
[00:58:23.300 --> 00:58:28.020]   I agree that I just don't see this happening for so many different reasons.
[00:58:28.020 --> 00:58:31.700]   It's the same three reasons that everybody's coming up with that the margins are so very
[00:58:31.700 --> 00:58:35.180]   thin that people don't necessarily look to replace.
[00:58:35.180 --> 00:58:38.540]   They look to replace a phone every couple of years, a computer every two or three years.
[00:58:38.540 --> 00:58:42.580]   They replace their TV when it stops working or when Mary Hart starts looking purple on
[00:58:42.580 --> 00:58:43.580]   her camera.
[00:58:43.580 --> 00:58:44.580]   She's there.
[00:58:44.580 --> 00:58:46.580]   I don't know.
[00:58:46.580 --> 00:58:51.020]   I only see, I have not, really the last time I saw Mary Hart was on the telephone two
[00:58:51.020 --> 00:58:54.380]   days ago, that's when I realized, oh, she's still in the business.
[00:58:54.380 --> 00:58:56.380]   I'm sorry, but I digress.
[00:58:56.380 --> 00:59:00.060]   The only way I could possibly see this happening is if they decide to build something brand
[00:59:00.060 --> 00:59:04.700]   new that could be described as a television set, but that does things that TVs don't
[00:59:04.700 --> 00:59:05.700]   do.
[00:59:05.700 --> 00:59:09.820]   The same way that Apple was, all the rumors about Apple developing a tablet were true,
[00:59:09.820 --> 00:59:14.420]   but they decided to do things in a brand new way so that it really had no overlap, very
[00:59:14.420 --> 00:59:16.700]   little overlap with the way tablets have been done before.
[00:59:16.700 --> 00:59:20.900]   I could definitely see it if they said that if you've got an iPhone, if you've got an
[00:59:20.900 --> 00:59:26.020]   iPad, this is the TV you want and you were going to want to even spend $150 over the normal
[00:59:26.020 --> 00:59:28.220]   cost of 42 inch TV to get it.
[00:59:28.220 --> 00:59:34.020]   If it ran iOS apps, I'm not even talking about two days after it's released, they break into
[00:59:34.020 --> 00:59:38.540]   the ROMs, people break into the ROMs and realize, oh, well, actually it is running iOS and it
[00:59:38.540 --> 00:59:41.060]   can technically run apps with their way to get on it.
[00:59:41.060 --> 00:59:46.500]   I mean that if it were released with an app library, not only that, but also with Netflix
[00:59:46.500 --> 00:59:47.500]   is on board.
[00:59:47.500 --> 00:59:48.500]   Hulu is on board.
[00:59:48.500 --> 00:59:57.700]   And if they decided to put a touch screen in front of it, not a huge slick, a thousand
[00:59:57.700 --> 01:00:01.700]   point multi touch display like they have on the iPad, but some way that I could simply
[01:00:01.700 --> 01:00:06.060]   walk up to it, touch something and get a better interactive experience that I would get with
[01:00:06.060 --> 01:00:08.020]   the usual five cookie remote.
[01:00:08.020 --> 01:00:11.620]   So that's the only circumstance under which I could possibly see Apple getting into the
[01:00:11.620 --> 01:00:12.620]   TV market.
[01:00:12.620 --> 01:00:15.260]   Otherwise, I just don't know why they even bother.
[01:00:15.260 --> 01:00:19.660]   The main monster of Piper Jaffrey said based on information from component manufacturers
[01:00:19.660 --> 01:00:21.980]   and Apple TV is in the works.
[01:00:21.980 --> 01:00:29.420]   The company has reportedly also made a mystery expenditure of $3.9 billion on component parts.
[01:00:29.420 --> 01:00:30.420]   I don't know.
[01:00:30.420 --> 01:00:32.020]   This stuff is so silly.
[01:00:32.020 --> 01:00:36.420]   I just, I want to go on record saying no freaking way.
[01:00:36.420 --> 01:00:42.340]   So I, we've have brought this up a couple times last couple of years and I have constantly,
[01:00:42.340 --> 01:00:43.940]   you know, believe that they're going to build a TV.
[01:00:43.940 --> 01:00:46.980]   I think that the TV is the last bit of this puzzle.
[01:00:46.980 --> 01:00:47.980]   Right.
[01:00:47.980 --> 01:00:50.180]   I think that it is, it completes the living room.
[01:00:50.180 --> 01:00:54.580]   I think they put the eyesight camera into it and it changes the way FaceTime works.
[01:00:54.580 --> 01:00:59.900]   I think that, you know, having the Apple TV does not quite have that total experience
[01:00:59.900 --> 01:01:03.220]   that Apple wants to provide without having, you know, all those pieces into it.
[01:01:03.220 --> 01:01:06.820]   I think that I do not think it made sense when they didn't have a strong iOS, when they
[01:01:06.820 --> 01:01:08.420]   hadn't figured out the iOS development.
[01:01:08.420 --> 01:01:12.620]   I think as a hobby, Apple TV allowed them to figure all of these pieces out.
[01:01:12.620 --> 01:01:19.740]   I do think an iOS in a TV, especially if they wrap it tightly with the kind of wrapping
[01:01:19.740 --> 01:01:24.020]   we've already seen with the Apple TV, you know, with your iPad, with your iPhone so that
[01:01:24.020 --> 01:01:29.300]   you're able to control it, that becomes a very, very tight integration that I think is going
[01:01:29.300 --> 01:01:30.300]   to be very compelling.
[01:01:30.300 --> 01:01:34.100]   And I think that Apple has figured out how to make a lot of these, a lot of these units.
[01:01:34.100 --> 01:01:37.700]   You know, they're no longer the super expensive pieces.
[01:01:37.700 --> 01:01:41.460]   Companies are having a hard time matching price and performance with the iPhone, with
[01:01:41.460 --> 01:01:46.020]   the iPad, with their, with their 11 inch, you know, they, I'm not saying it'll be a cheap
[01:01:46.020 --> 01:01:50.660]   monitor, but there are, I think there's a lot of people out there that would buy them.
[01:01:50.660 --> 01:01:54.300]   I think there's a lot of people that would see that, that integration.
[01:01:54.300 --> 01:01:58.660]   And I think that talking about that in October before Christmas with, you know, and football
[01:01:58.660 --> 01:02:00.380]   and, you know, football and NASA.
[01:02:00.380 --> 01:02:02.020]   It's the right time to do it.
[01:02:02.020 --> 01:02:06.420]   It also would make sense perhaps that Steve Jobs would want to finish it off.
[01:02:06.420 --> 01:02:13.820]   And leave Apple with a product that is another category that could, you know, that if you
[01:02:13.820 --> 01:02:19.340]   got the iPad, it's a pretty good legacy as is the iPhone and the iPod and all this.
[01:02:19.340 --> 01:02:20.340]   But one more thing.
[01:02:20.340 --> 01:02:24.740]   And if you had a 2048 by, you know, I don't know what that would be.
[01:02:24.740 --> 01:02:28.900]   I don't think it'll be a four by three aspect ratio, like a 1536, but a 2048 by whatever
[01:02:28.900 --> 01:02:30.940]   would be slightly higher resolution than a regular TV.
[01:02:30.940 --> 01:02:31.940]   So it's not really a TV.
[01:02:31.940 --> 01:02:34.140]   It's a retina display on a new line.
[01:02:34.140 --> 01:02:36.740]   The lean back display maybe of some kind.
[01:02:36.740 --> 01:02:41.900]   I would just like to see anybody in addition to citing analysts and addition to citing
[01:02:41.900 --> 01:02:48.060]   component orders orders, I wish that anybody could explain a case in which, especially
[01:02:48.060 --> 01:02:53.900]   for Apple, packaging and entire TV would make more sense to them than simply reducing the
[01:02:53.900 --> 01:02:55.620]   price of the Apple TV by 20 bucks.
[01:02:55.620 --> 01:02:56.620]   Right.
[01:02:56.620 --> 01:02:57.620]   Right.
[01:02:57.620 --> 01:02:59.180]   I think about the thing is that there's, I think if I was Apple, I'd do both.
[01:02:59.180 --> 01:03:01.220]   I'd have an Apple TV for people who don't want to buy that.
[01:03:01.220 --> 01:03:06.260]   But they're already, they're already 99% of it though, without getting into this.
[01:03:06.260 --> 01:03:09.580]   But you don't have, for instance, the eyesight, I really think that the eyesight changes
[01:03:09.580 --> 01:03:10.580]   face time.
[01:03:10.580 --> 01:03:16.700]   The eyesight having a permanent fixture, part of the TV that's ready to work, you know,
[01:03:16.700 --> 01:03:20.980]   that's integrated into the iOS and allows people to, I mean, that's Jetsons, you know,
[01:03:20.980 --> 01:03:24.020]   and that's, you know, I mean, that is the Jetsons at that point, you know, and the thing
[01:03:24.020 --> 01:03:27.220]   is is that without that, they're never going to get the TV manufacturers to integrate that
[01:03:27.220 --> 01:03:30.340]   tight, tight enough with Apple TV to do that.
[01:03:30.340 --> 01:03:34.260]   And I think that that does tie in a whole lot of elements.
[01:03:34.260 --> 01:03:38.580]   Raven Lee, and I posited this question on Google Plus, who people would say very interesting
[01:03:38.580 --> 01:03:40.820]   conversation as usual on Google Plus.
[01:03:40.820 --> 01:03:43.580]   Raven Lee says, "Apple should just buy Sony."
[01:03:43.580 --> 01:03:44.580]   Apple already makes TVs.
[01:03:44.580 --> 01:03:45.580]   They're called iMacs.
[01:03:45.580 --> 01:03:47.740]   I mean, the thing is, it's not like they don't know how to make displays.
[01:03:47.740 --> 01:03:50.140]   I mean, they've been making 30-inch displays.
[01:03:50.140 --> 01:03:51.820]   They've been making 27-inch iMacs.
[01:03:51.820 --> 01:03:53.140]   They've been doing a lot of that stuff already.
[01:03:53.140 --> 01:03:56.700]   I mean, this is not, they don't need to buy anybody to do this.
[01:03:56.700 --> 01:03:58.860]   They've already, they already know how to do build displays.
[01:03:58.860 --> 01:04:02.700]   A lot of people had the point of view that Bob O'Bringer did, which is, well, it's easy
[01:04:02.700 --> 01:04:04.940]   to say it's a dumb idea.
[01:04:04.940 --> 01:04:08.420]   In fact, I've said a number of things Apple's done as a dumb idea, including the retail
[01:04:08.420 --> 01:04:09.420]   stores.
[01:04:09.420 --> 01:04:11.740]   He says, "You know how that usually turns out?
[01:04:11.740 --> 01:04:15.100]   If they do it, it will only be when they can bring something completely into the table
[01:04:15.100 --> 01:04:17.540]   with an experience nobody has seen before.
[01:04:17.540 --> 01:04:24.420]   If they release a TV, he has faith as many Apple fans do, that it will be a killer because
[01:04:24.420 --> 01:04:25.420]   Apple wouldn't do it."
[01:04:25.420 --> 01:04:26.420]   We'll buy it because that's what we do.
[01:04:26.420 --> 01:04:27.420]   It's so generous, yeah.
[01:04:27.420 --> 01:04:28.420]   Right.
[01:04:28.420 --> 01:04:29.420]   It's so generous.
[01:04:29.420 --> 01:04:30.420]   It's so generous.
[01:04:30.420 --> 01:04:31.420]   It's so generous.
[01:04:31.420 --> 01:04:32.420]   It's so generous.
[01:04:32.420 --> 01:04:33.420]   It's so generous.
[01:04:33.420 --> 01:04:34.420]   And I'm not sure that I'm going to be able to do that.
[01:04:34.420 --> 01:04:35.420]   I'm not going to be able to do that.
[01:04:35.420 --> 01:04:36.420]   I'm not going to be able to do that.
[01:04:36.420 --> 01:04:37.420]   I'm not going to be able to do that.
[01:04:37.420 --> 01:04:38.420]   I'm not going to be able to do that.
[01:04:38.420 --> 01:04:39.420]   I'm not going to be able to do that.
[01:04:39.420 --> 01:04:40.420]   I'm not going to be able to do that.
[01:04:40.420 --> 01:04:41.420]   I'm not going to be able to do that.
[01:04:41.420 --> 01:04:42.420]   I'm not going to be able to do that.
[01:04:42.420 --> 01:04:43.420]   I'm not going to be able to do that.
[01:04:43.420 --> 01:04:44.420]   I'm not going to be able to do that.
[01:04:44.420 --> 01:04:45.420]   I'm not going to be able to do that.
[01:04:45.420 --> 01:04:46.420]   I'm not going to be able to do that.
[01:04:46.420 --> 01:05:06.420]   I'm not going to be able to do that.
[01:05:06.420 --> 01:05:32.420]   I'm not going to be able to do that.
[01:05:32.420 --> 01:05:39.420]   I'm not going to be able to do that.
[01:05:39.420 --> 01:05:46.420]   I'm not going to be able to do that.
[01:05:46.420 --> 01:05:53.420]   I'm not going to be able to do that.
[01:05:53.420 --> 01:05:58.420]   I'm not going to be able to do that.
[01:05:58.420 --> 01:06:06.420]   I'm not going to be able to do that.
[01:06:06.420 --> 01:06:13.420]   I'm not going to be able to do that.
[01:06:13.420 --> 01:06:20.420]   I'm not going to be able to do that.
[01:06:20.420 --> 01:06:27.420]   I'm not going to be able to do that.
[01:06:27.420 --> 01:06:32.420]   I'm not going to be able to do that.
[01:06:32.420 --> 01:06:37.420]   I'm not going to be able to do that.
[01:06:37.420 --> 01:06:42.420]   I'm not going to be able to do that.
[01:06:42.420 --> 01:06:47.420]   I'm not going to be able to do that.
[01:06:47.420 --> 01:06:52.420]   I'm not going to be able to do that.
[01:06:52.420 --> 01:07:01.420]   I'm not going to be able to do that.
[01:07:01.420 --> 01:07:06.420]   I'm not going to be able to do that.
[01:07:06.420 --> 01:07:11.420]   I'm not going to be able to do that.
[01:07:11.420 --> 01:07:18.420]   I'm not going to be able to do that.
[01:07:18.420 --> 01:07:24.420]   I'm not going to be able to do that.
[01:07:24.420 --> 01:07:29.420]   I'm not going to be able to do that.
[01:07:29.420 --> 01:07:33.420]   I'm not going to be able to do that.
[01:07:33.420 --> 01:07:38.420]   I'm not going to be able to do that.
[01:07:38.420 --> 01:07:43.420]   I'm not going to be able to do that.
[01:07:43.420 --> 01:07:53.420]   I'm not going to be able to do that.
[01:07:53.420 --> 01:07:58.420]   I'll throw some kerosene on the fire.
[01:07:58.420 --> 01:08:03.420]   What if Apple's dealings with nuance
[01:08:03.420 --> 01:08:08.420]   is intended for the TV and not necessarily for the phone?
[01:08:08.420 --> 01:08:13.420]   I'm not going to be able to do that.
[01:08:13.420 --> 01:08:18.420]   I'm not going to be able to do that.
[01:08:18.420 --> 01:08:23.420]   I'm not going to be able to do that.

[01:13:43.420 --> 01:13:48.420]   I'm not going to be able to do that.
[01:13:48.420 --> 01:13:52.420]   I'm not going to be able to do that.
[01:13:52.420 --> 01:13:57.420]   I'm not going to be able to do that.
[01:13:57.420 --> 01:14:02.420]   I'm not going to be able to do that.
[01:14:02.420 --> 01:14:07.420]   I'm not going to be able to do that.
[01:14:07.420 --> 01:14:12.420]   I'm not going to be able to do that.
[01:14:12.420 --> 01:14:17.420]   I'm not going to be able to do that.
[01:14:17.420 --> 01:14:21.420]   I'm not going to be able to do that.
[01:14:21.420 --> 01:14:26.420]   I'm not going to be able to do that.
[01:14:26.420 --> 01:14:31.420]   I'm not going to be able to do that.
[01:14:31.420 --> 01:14:36.420]   I'm not going to be able to do that.
[01:14:36.420 --> 01:14:41.420]   I'm not going to be able to do that.
[01:14:41.420 --> 01:14:46.420]   I'm not going to be able to do that.
[01:14:46.420 --> 01:14:50.420]   I'm not going to be able to do that.
[01:14:50.420 --> 01:14:55.420]   I'm not going to be able to do that.
[01:14:55.420 --> 01:15:00.420]   I'm not going to be able to do that.
[01:15:00.420 --> 01:15:05.420]   I'm not going to be able to do that.
[01:15:05.420 --> 01:15:10.420]   I'm not going to be able to do that.
[01:15:10.420 --> 01:15:15.420]   I'm not going to be able to do that.
[01:15:15.420 --> 01:15:19.420]   I'm not going to be able to do that.
[01:15:19.420 --> 01:15:24.420]   I'm not going to be able to do that.
[01:15:24.420 --> 01:15:29.420]   I'm not going to be able to do that.
[01:15:29.420 --> 01:15:34.420]   I'm not going to be able to do that.
[01:15:34.420 --> 01:15:39.420]   I'm not going to be able to do that.
[01:15:39.420 --> 01:15:44.420]   I'm not going to be able to do that.
[01:15:44.420 --> 01:15:48.420]   I'm not going to be able to do that.
[01:15:48.420 --> 01:15:53.420]   I'm not going to be able to do that.
[01:15:53.420 --> 01:15:58.420]   I'm not going to be able to do that.
[01:15:58.420 --> 01:16:03.420]   I'm not going to be able to do that.
[01:16:03.420 --> 01:16:08.420]   I'm not going to be able to do that.
[01:16:08.420 --> 01:16:13.420]   I'm not going to be able to do that.
[01:16:13.420 --> 01:16:17.420]   I'm not going to be able to do that.
[01:16:17.420 --> 01:16:22.420]   I'm not going to be able to do that.
[01:16:22.420 --> 01:16:27.420]   I'm not going to be able to do that.
[01:16:27.420 --> 01:16:32.420]   I'm not going to be able to do that.
[01:16:32.420 --> 01:16:37.420]   I'm not going to be able to do that.
[01:16:37.420 --> 01:16:42.420]   I'm not going to be able to do that.
[01:16:42.420 --> 01:16:46.420]   I'm not going to be able to do that.
[01:16:46.420 --> 01:16:51.420]   I'm not going to be able to do that.
[01:16:51.420 --> 01:16:56.420]   I'm not going to be able to do that.
[01:16:56.420 --> 01:17:01.420]   I'm not going to be able to do that.
[01:17:01.420 --> 01:17:06.420]   I'm not going to be able to do that.
[01:17:06.420 --> 01:17:11.420]   I'm not going to be able to do that.
[01:17:11.420 --> 01:17:15.420]   I'm not going to be able to do that.
[01:17:15.420 --> 01:17:20.420]   I'm not going to be able to do that.
[01:17:20.420 --> 01:17:25.420]   I'm not going to be able to do that.
[01:17:25.420 --> 01:17:30.420]   I'm not going to be able to do that.
[01:17:30.420 --> 01:17:35.420]   I'm not going to be able to do that.
[01:17:35.420 --> 01:17:40.420]   I'm not going to be able to do that.
[01:17:40.420 --> 01:17:44.420]   I'm not going to be able to do that.
[01:17:44.420 --> 01:17:49.420]   I'm not going to be able to do that.
[01:17:49.420 --> 01:17:54.420]   I'm not going to be able to do that.
[01:17:54.420 --> 01:17:59.420]   I'm not going to be able to do that.
[01:17:59.420 --> 01:18:04.420]   I'm not going to be able to do that.
[01:18:04.420 --> 01:18:09.420]   I'm not going to be able to do that.
[01:18:09.420 --> 01:18:13.420]   I'm not going to be able to do that.
[01:18:13.420 --> 01:18:18.420]   I'm not going to be able to do that.
[01:18:18.420 --> 01:18:23.420]   I'm not going to be able to do that.
[01:18:23.420 --> 01:18:28.420]   I'm not going to be able to do that.
[01:18:28.420 --> 01:18:33.420]   I'm not going to be able to do that.
[01:18:33.420 --> 01:18:38.420]   I'm not going to be able to do that.
[01:18:38.420 --> 01:18:42.420]   I'm not going to be able to do that.
[01:18:42.420 --> 01:18:47.420]   I'm not going to be able to do that.
[01:18:47.420 --> 01:18:52.420]   I'm not going to be able to do that.
[01:18:52.420 --> 01:18:57.420]   I'm not going to be able to do that.
[01:18:57.420 --> 01:19:02.420]   I'm not going to be able to do that.
[01:19:02.420 --> 01:19:07.420]   I'm not going to be able to do that.
[01:19:07.420 --> 01:19:11.420]   I'm not going to be able to do that.
[01:19:11.420 --> 01:19:16.420]   I'm not going to be able to do that.
[01:19:16.420 --> 01:19:21.420]   I'm not going to be able to do that.
[01:19:21.420 --> 01:19:26.420]   I'm not going to be able to do that.
[01:19:26.420 --> 01:19:31.420]   I'm not going to be able to do that.
[01:19:31.420 --> 01:19:36.420]   I'm not going to be able to do that.
[01:19:36.420 --> 01:19:40.420]   I'm not going to be able to do that.
[01:19:40.420 --> 01:19:45.420]   I'm not going to be able to do that.
[01:19:45.420 --> 01:19:50.420]   I'm not going to be able to do that.
[01:19:50.420 --> 01:19:55.420]   I'm not going to be able to do that.
[01:19:55.420 --> 01:20:00.420]   I'm not going to be able to do that.
[01:20:00.420 --> 01:20:05.420]   I'm not going to be able to do that.
[01:20:05.420 --> 01:20:09.420]   I'm not going to be able to do that.
[01:20:09.420 --> 01:20:14.420]   I'm not going to be able to do that.
[01:20:14.420 --> 01:20:19.420]   I'm not going to be able to do that.
[01:20:19.420 --> 01:20:24.420]   I'm not going to be able to do that.
[01:20:24.420 --> 01:20:29.420]   I'm not going to be able to do that.
[01:20:29.420 --> 01:20:34.420]   I'm not going to be able to do that.
[01:20:34.420 --> 01:20:38.420]   I'm not going to be able to do that.
[01:20:38.420 --> 01:20:43.420]   I'm not going to be able to do that.
[01:20:43.420 --> 01:20:48.420]   I can't do multi-cam.
[01:20:48.420 --> 01:20:53.420]   I can definitely see where Final Cut 10 is.
[01:20:53.420 --> 01:20:58.420]   I went down to Robert Lloyd Lewis,
[01:20:58.420 --> 01:21:01.420]   who was a fan of the show,
[01:21:01.420 --> 01:21:06.420]   and went down to a set of Dexter,
[01:21:06.420 --> 01:21:11.420]   and then the show is very interesting.
[01:21:11.420 --> 01:21:16.420]   They have eight days to shoot that show.
[01:21:16.420 --> 01:21:21.420]   As you know, you were there.
[01:21:21.420 --> 01:21:24.420]   But the editors start working as soon as the footage is done
[01:21:24.420 --> 01:21:29.420]   from one day, they start working on it the next day.
[01:21:29.420 --> 01:21:34.420]   It's really cool, but they're avid.
[01:21:34.420 --> 01:21:37.420]   I think it's been 10 days or 12 days to cut it.
[01:21:37.420 --> 01:21:42.420]   Then the director comes and has four total days to take that rough cut
[01:21:42.420 --> 01:21:45.420]   and polish it and finish it.
[01:21:45.420 --> 01:21:46.420]   They have a couple of days for music use,
[01:21:46.420 --> 01:21:47.420]   and then it's out the door.
[01:21:47.420 --> 01:21:50.420]   They don't have a lot of time.
[01:21:50.420 --> 01:21:53.420]   And you know, Avid's Quick, Avid's Fast.
[01:21:53.420 --> 01:21:56.420]   By the way, Bob, thank you so much.
[01:21:56.420 --> 01:21:57.420]   He was so generous.
[01:21:57.420 --> 01:22:00.420]   I had really enjoyed the tour.
[01:22:00.420 --> 01:22:03.420]   We did pretty much the same tour, I think, as you.
[01:22:03.420 --> 01:22:07.420]   It was full by the way.
[01:22:07.420 --> 01:22:08.420]   Yes.
[01:22:08.420 --> 01:22:11.420]   I noticed that they didn't offer me one either.
[01:22:11.420 --> 01:22:13.420]   I was like, look at that.
[01:22:13.420 --> 01:22:13.420]   It was full.
[01:22:13.420 --> 01:22:14.420]   But I finally found some after that.
[01:22:14.420 --> 01:22:17.420]   After I saw that, I became so cool.
[01:22:17.420 --> 01:22:18.420]   I love what we do.
[01:22:18.420 --> 01:22:22.420]   But to see a true Hollywood production operate is just amazing.
[01:22:22.420 --> 01:22:26.420]   It's funny because the sound guy who's also in our chat room
[01:22:26.420 --> 01:22:31.420]   as sound guy, I believe, is his handle, was there any recording on us?
[01:22:31.420 --> 01:22:35.420]   Just as you recommended, one of those little sound design--
[01:22:35.420 --> 01:22:36.420]   Sound device boxes.
[01:22:36.420 --> 01:22:39.420]   That's the stereo mix for the dailies.
[01:22:39.420 --> 01:22:40.420]   Right.
[01:22:40.420 --> 01:22:42.420]   And then they do an 8-track Fostex device.
[01:22:42.420 --> 01:22:43.420]   Which is because that's what they had.
[01:22:43.420 --> 01:22:45.420]   Yeah, Fostex is kind of an old name.
[01:22:45.420 --> 01:22:47.420]   But that's 8 tracks.
[01:22:47.420 --> 01:22:51.420]   But the assistant director and the sound guy and us,
[01:22:51.420 --> 01:22:53.420]   we're all hiding.
[01:22:53.420 --> 01:22:54.420]   Because it's such an open set.
[01:22:54.420 --> 01:22:56.420]   It's one of those shows where they have a steady cam
[01:22:56.420 --> 01:22:59.420]   and they follow Dexter around the set like this.
[01:22:59.420 --> 01:23:01.420]   So we're hiding behind a scrim.
[01:23:01.420 --> 01:23:02.420]   We're back here.
[01:23:02.420 --> 01:23:03.420]   We're back here.
[01:23:03.420 --> 01:23:04.420]   Don't see us.
[01:23:04.420 --> 01:23:07.420]   And you can hear the actors on the other side doing the thing.
[01:23:07.420 --> 01:23:09.420]   It was so much fun watching it on the video tap.
[01:23:09.420 --> 01:23:12.420]   And just amazing.
[01:23:12.420 --> 01:23:15.420]   You never realize the scale of what it takes to do a show like that.
[01:23:15.420 --> 01:23:17.420]   It's a lot of single shot.
[01:23:17.420 --> 01:23:19.420]   Like every cut is so well planned out.
[01:23:19.420 --> 01:23:21.420]   Well, and that's what you really are--
[01:23:21.420 --> 01:23:26.420]   I was really left with the impression of the craft that goes into this.
[01:23:26.420 --> 01:23:29.420]   And Bob's built such a good team of people.
[01:23:29.420 --> 01:23:34.420]   They're all independent little wheels in this machine doing their best work
[01:23:34.420 --> 01:23:38.420]   from the craft services to the sound to the director.
[01:23:38.420 --> 01:23:40.420]   And it's just really fun to watch.
[01:23:40.420 --> 01:23:42.420]   Boy, is that amazing.
[01:23:42.420 --> 01:23:44.420]   It's a humbling experience.
[01:23:44.420 --> 01:23:45.420]   Yeah, it is.
[01:23:45.420 --> 01:23:48.420]   And it makes me love the show even more because now I know some of the secrets behind it.
[01:23:48.420 --> 01:23:49.420]   It's crazy.
[01:23:49.420 --> 01:23:50.420]   After you see the show, it's completely different.
[01:23:50.420 --> 01:23:52.420]   Like after you've used it there.
[01:23:52.420 --> 01:23:55.420]   Well, I told Bob I said, you know, I thought we weren't going to see much
[01:23:55.420 --> 01:23:57.420]   because Dexter takes place in Miami.
[01:23:57.420 --> 01:23:59.420]   So I figure, well, you might do a few interiors here.
[01:23:59.420 --> 01:24:01.420]   The whole thing is done in Hollywood.
[01:24:01.420 --> 01:24:04.420]   It's movie magic, kids.
[01:24:04.420 --> 01:24:07.420]   I don't know if Bob was going to-- he just kind of swarmed me to secrecy.
[01:24:07.420 --> 01:24:09.420]   But I think it was mostly on the season.
[01:24:09.420 --> 01:24:11.420]   I could do one little thing.
[01:24:11.420 --> 01:24:14.420]   So slap me back the side of the head if this is--
[01:24:14.420 --> 01:24:16.420]   Bob, I hope I'm not letting any secret.
[01:24:16.420 --> 01:24:18.420]   But you know, it's shot in Miami.
[01:24:18.420 --> 01:24:20.420]   The police department's in Miami, second floor in Miami.
[01:24:20.420 --> 01:24:24.420]   It's funny because all the trees are the tops of the trees because they're on the second floor.
[01:24:24.420 --> 01:24:31.420]   But then they have a scrim, a translate of Miami skyline.
[01:24:31.420 --> 01:24:34.420]   But they have to make it kind of feel real and alive.
[01:24:34.420 --> 01:24:37.420]   So they put little pieces of plastic on it.
[01:24:37.420 --> 01:24:39.420]   And then they blow a fan across it and it catches the light.
[01:24:39.420 --> 01:24:41.420]   It looks like the water's twinkling.
[01:24:41.420 --> 01:24:44.420]   I'm never going to look at that water the same way again.
[01:24:44.420 --> 01:24:46.420]   And now show time is like we're never letting the only ones--
[01:24:46.420 --> 01:24:48.420]   And they do something else magic, wait a minute.
[01:24:48.420 --> 01:24:51.420]   So it's daylight, but if they shine a light through it from back--
[01:24:51.420 --> 01:24:53.420]   and even Bob said, I don't know how this works.
[01:24:53.420 --> 01:24:54.420]   They shine a light from the back.
[01:24:54.420 --> 01:24:56.420]   It's nighttime.
[01:24:56.420 --> 01:24:57.420]   Is that magic?
[01:24:57.420 --> 01:24:58.420]   It's magic.
[01:24:58.420 --> 01:24:59.420]   It's amazing.
[01:24:59.420 --> 01:25:01.420]   The o's come back from the glitter factory.
[01:25:01.420 --> 01:25:03.420]   I'm a little-- I got the bug.
[01:25:03.420 --> 01:25:04.420]   He's looking at these windows going.
[01:25:04.420 --> 01:25:05.420]   I'm glad.
[01:25:05.420 --> 01:25:06.420]   What can we do?
[01:25:06.420 --> 01:25:07.420]   Some tops.
[01:25:07.420 --> 01:25:08.420]   I got the bug.
[01:25:08.420 --> 01:25:09.420]   No, it's just so, so fun.
[01:25:09.420 --> 01:25:10.420]   I--
[01:25:10.420 --> 01:25:11.420]   And Andy, I'm sure you're invited.
[01:25:11.420 --> 01:25:13.420]   He's a big fan.
[01:25:13.420 --> 01:25:15.420]   You know, Robert is also an inventor.
[01:25:15.420 --> 01:25:17.420]   He's a guy invented the OpenX.
[01:25:17.420 --> 01:25:18.420]   Yeah.
[01:25:18.420 --> 01:25:19.420]   Which is awesome.
[01:25:19.420 --> 01:25:20.420]   Blister pack opener.
[01:25:20.420 --> 01:25:22.420]   And he gave me a few other things.
[01:25:22.420 --> 01:25:24.420]   And he's working on an iPad app.
[01:25:24.420 --> 01:25:28.420]   I'm going to be in LA for the MacTech Conference in about a month or so.
[01:25:28.420 --> 01:25:29.420]   Oh, you've got to go.
[01:25:29.420 --> 01:25:30.420]   Go, go, go, go.
[01:25:30.420 --> 01:25:33.420]   He's already given me the tour and Alex the tour.
[01:25:33.420 --> 01:25:36.420]   I'm sure he'll give you one more, but it's just wonderful.
[01:25:36.420 --> 01:25:38.420]   It was just so thank you, Bob.
[01:25:38.420 --> 01:25:39.420]   It was incredible.
[01:25:39.420 --> 01:25:40.420]   And his nephew works at Apple.
[01:25:40.420 --> 01:25:41.420]   Yeah.
[01:25:41.420 --> 01:25:42.420]   I will name Eddie Dabes.
[01:25:42.420 --> 01:25:45.420]   He didn't tell us anything, but it was really fun.
[01:25:45.420 --> 01:25:50.420]   A lot of-- he said-- his nephew said when I wrote the Apple bus in San Francisco, you'd be surprised
[01:25:50.420 --> 01:25:53.420]   how many people who listened to Mac break weekly on that bus.
[01:25:53.420 --> 01:25:55.420]   So hello to all the people in the bus.
[01:25:55.420 --> 01:25:57.420]   He said-- he said his first day.
[01:25:57.420 --> 01:25:59.420]   You know, the Google bus pulls up.
[01:25:59.420 --> 01:26:01.420]   The Google employees get it.
[01:26:01.420 --> 01:26:04.420]   All the employees want to live in San Francisco and work in Silicon Valley, right?
[01:26:04.420 --> 01:26:07.420]   Google bus pulls up, you know, the eBay bus pulls in, you know, like guys.
[01:26:07.420 --> 01:26:10.420]   And he says, and then the Apple bus arrives.
[01:26:10.420 --> 01:26:12.420]   He says, it's a space vehicle.
[01:26:12.420 --> 01:26:13.420]   Perfectly designed.
[01:26:13.420 --> 01:26:17.420]   He says, I know for a fact Steve Jobs oversaw every detail.
[01:26:17.420 --> 01:26:18.420]   Leather seats.
[01:26:18.420 --> 01:26:20.420]   It's just-- it's like--
[01:26:20.420 --> 01:26:23.420]   And the wheels are just cosmetic.
[01:26:23.420 --> 01:26:25.420]   Absolutely.
[01:26:25.420 --> 01:26:27.420]   It's a patented technology.
[01:26:27.420 --> 01:26:28.420]   And we have a name for this show.
[01:26:28.420 --> 01:26:31.420]   They were just sick of getting pulled over for hovering down the highway.
[01:26:31.420 --> 01:26:35.420]   It's good to have unbelievable, unbelievable.
[01:26:35.420 --> 01:26:37.420]   We have an email address right now.
[01:26:37.420 --> 01:26:38.420]   Folks want to email us.
[01:26:38.420 --> 01:26:40.420]   Macbreak@twit.tv.
[01:26:40.420 --> 01:26:42.420]   Thank you to Eileen for setting that up.
[01:26:42.420 --> 01:26:45.420]   So we are accepting email questions, comments, suggestions.
[01:26:45.420 --> 01:26:48.420]   We really want to make the show more interactive with you, the audience.
[01:26:48.420 --> 01:26:51.420]   So if you want to send us videos or audio clips, that'd be great too.
[01:26:51.420 --> 01:26:53.420]   Macbreak@twit.tv.
[01:26:53.420 --> 01:26:57.420]   Joel sent us a question regarding episode 262 last week.
[01:26:57.420 --> 01:27:02.420]   He said, when Leo is giving his lion tip, he had some beautiful desk top pictures.
[01:27:02.420 --> 01:27:03.420]   He said, where'd you get those?
[01:27:03.420 --> 01:27:07.420]   Well, I've just been collecting them over the years from a lot of different sources.
[01:27:07.420 --> 01:27:11.420]   In fact, Google Plus is a great place because there's so many great photographers on here.
[01:27:11.420 --> 01:27:14.420]   And so if I hide all my-- let's hide email and see if it--
[01:27:14.420 --> 01:27:17.420]   if I can-- how do you-- I don't call anybody.
[01:27:17.420 --> 01:27:19.420]   I want to send a message, cancel.
[01:27:19.420 --> 01:27:22.420]   Cancel, cancel, cancel.
[01:27:22.420 --> 01:27:25.420]   I'll never mind.
[01:27:25.420 --> 01:27:28.420]   How do you get out of full screen mode?
[01:27:28.420 --> 01:27:31.420]   Not that way apparently.
[01:27:31.420 --> 01:27:32.420]   There we go.
[01:27:32.420 --> 01:27:33.420]   Thank you.
[01:27:33.420 --> 01:27:34.420]   Now hide it.
[01:27:34.420 --> 01:27:38.420]   So these are some storm pictures that somebody posted.
[01:27:38.420 --> 01:27:40.420]   Let's hide this one.
[01:27:40.420 --> 01:27:42.420]   So I just have a-- I like landscapes.
[01:27:42.420 --> 01:27:44.420]   So I can't say there's one source.
[01:27:44.420 --> 01:27:46.420]   It's just-- I've been collecting them for years.
[01:27:46.420 --> 01:27:49.420]   I have hundreds of them in my little desktop pictures folder.
[01:27:49.420 --> 01:27:50.420]   I will give you a tip though.
[01:27:50.420 --> 01:27:58.420]   I remember I talked about spider oak last week as a way to sync this stuff.
[01:27:58.420 --> 01:28:01.420]   And I do in fact sync my desktop pictures via spider oak.
[01:28:01.420 --> 01:28:11.420]   So whatever I put in my desktop pictures folder, which now has a 329 desktop pictures, automatically gets synchronized to all of my machines.
[01:28:11.420 --> 01:28:13.420]   So all of my machines have lovely desktop pictures.
[01:28:13.420 --> 01:28:17.420]   These are the storm pictures I got somewhere I can't remember where, but these are gorgeous.
[01:28:17.420 --> 01:28:20.420]   So that's-- there's no right-- there's no answer to that question actually.
[01:28:20.420 --> 01:28:21.420]   I just been collecting them.
[01:28:21.420 --> 01:28:27.420]   Anytime I see a great landscape, these are some recent ones I got from Google+ and I don't have the photographers name.
[01:28:27.420 --> 01:28:29.420]   I apologize.
[01:28:29.420 --> 01:28:31.420]   But just some amazing stuff.
[01:28:31.420 --> 01:28:34.420]   Pelican Cove, this is local pigeon point.
[01:28:34.420 --> 01:28:35.420]   Big Sur.
[01:28:35.420 --> 01:28:36.420]   There's some Hawaiian.
[01:28:36.420 --> 01:28:40.420]   It's important that every time you see something that you like, you got to just right click on it.
[01:28:40.420 --> 01:28:42.420]   You got to just right click it and save it.
[01:28:42.420 --> 01:28:43.420]   Right click.
[01:28:43.420 --> 01:28:44.420]   That's what I do.
[01:28:44.420 --> 01:28:48.420]   Someone just a few weeks ago was complimenting me on this picture that I have behind me right now.
[01:28:48.420 --> 01:28:49.420]   Love that one.
[01:28:49.420 --> 01:29:09.420]   And people will recognize it as, oh, when the Mac 2 came out, this is like one of like a signature like mid 80s ray trace because it's all like things receding into infinity and chrome globes and was used to like demonstrate, oh, the Mac 2 now has color and has a color screen of 15 inches.
[01:29:09.420 --> 01:29:12.420]   Over 256 thirds.
[01:29:12.420 --> 01:29:14.420]   It's a little pixelated actually.
[01:29:14.420 --> 01:29:16.420]   And it is over.
[01:29:16.420 --> 01:29:19.420]   Look at that.
[01:29:19.420 --> 01:29:20.420]   Yeah.
[01:29:20.420 --> 01:29:22.420]   But at the time that was pretty spectacular.
[01:29:22.420 --> 01:29:26.420]   It was used because these did not exist.
[01:29:26.420 --> 01:29:30.420]   This shape did not exist in nature before it was called.
[01:29:30.420 --> 01:29:31.420]   It's amazing.
[01:29:31.420 --> 01:29:36.420]   Someone asked me where I got it and I could say, I don't know if I was in a folder of.
[01:29:36.420 --> 01:29:39.420]   I was cleaning out an old machine at one point.
[01:29:39.420 --> 01:29:43.420]   I saw this folder called pictures and as usual, cleaned it all out.
[01:29:43.420 --> 01:29:47.420]   Oh, at some point I came across that is probably off of one of the Apple history pages.
[01:29:47.420 --> 01:29:52.420]   But yeah, if you don't get in that habit, you don't have cool things to use as your desk.
[01:29:52.420 --> 01:30:00.420]   And that's where iCloud will be great or any Dropbox or any synchronization tool because it doesn't matter what Mac I'm on and I have several, you know, half a dozen of them.
[01:30:00.420 --> 01:30:04.420]   If I see a picture, I save it to the desktop pictures folder and I know that folder is being synchronized across.
[01:30:04.420 --> 01:30:06.420]   I take pictures of everything I'm trying to remember.
[01:30:06.420 --> 01:30:11.420]   Do you constantly want it around like, oh, if I see a billboard I like or anything else, not just like, I don't remember that.
[01:30:11.420 --> 01:30:14.420]   If I were as good a photographer as you just take my own desktop pictures.
[01:30:14.420 --> 01:30:21.420]   Oh, no, no, what I'm saying is I take desktop pictures, but I mean, when you're talking about just, I just remember the world through my iPhone, you know, because I sit there and go, oh, I need to remember that phone number.
[01:30:21.420 --> 01:30:23.420]   I took a picture of my passport.
[01:30:23.420 --> 01:30:25.420]   Well, every note's good for that.
[01:30:25.420 --> 01:30:26.420]   And it's the only way I got out of France.
[01:30:26.420 --> 01:30:27.420]   Because you had a picture.
[01:30:27.420 --> 01:30:28.420]   I had a picture of a very smart.
[01:30:28.420 --> 01:30:31.420]   Yeah, it was like, I just did it kind of, it was one of those things like I was waiting around for a flight.
[01:30:31.420 --> 01:30:34.420]   I was like, I always carry with my iPhone.
[01:30:34.420 --> 01:30:35.420]   Every note's really good for that.
[01:30:35.420 --> 01:30:36.420]   You can take a picture and it stores it.
[01:30:36.420 --> 01:30:38.420]   And that also synchronizes.
[01:30:38.420 --> 01:30:39.420]   All right, we're going to take a break.
[01:30:39.420 --> 01:30:44.420]   We got a Lion Tip and iOS Tip and we've got some pictures of the week too, but I want to first tell you about FreshBooks.
[01:30:44.420 --> 01:30:51.420]   I'll tell you what, if you are a freelancer and you do invoicing, this you got to know about it is beautiful.
[01:30:51.420 --> 01:30:55.420]   It's basically a web app, but it's very mac is very comfortable.
[01:30:55.420 --> 01:30:58.420]   I've been using it since 2004 for my invoices.
[01:30:58.420 --> 01:31:00.420]   It'll do automatic invoices better yet.
[01:31:00.420 --> 01:31:05.420]   These email invoices with your logo, very professional looking also have a Pay Leo Now button.
[01:31:05.420 --> 01:31:09.420]   I wish they all said Pay Leo Now, but they say Pay Me now, of course.
[01:31:09.420 --> 01:31:17.420]   And your clients can pay you via PayPal or authorized.net or 11 other online payment services.
[01:31:17.420 --> 01:31:19.420]   It really is fantastic.
[01:31:19.420 --> 01:31:23.420]   You can even set up automatic payments, which is pretty cool.
[01:31:23.420 --> 01:31:28.420]   They'll send out paper invoices for an additional fee, stamp it and mail it.
[01:31:28.420 --> 01:31:32.420]   Automatic ticklers and follow-ups, so you don't have to worry about late clients.
[01:31:32.420 --> 01:31:37.420]   But I think in general people pay you a lot faster because it's such an easy way to pay.
[01:31:37.420 --> 01:31:44.420]   And if you do time and expenses, there are iPhone, iPad app and their web app will make it so much easier.
[01:31:44.420 --> 01:31:47.420]   You just keep track on the iPhone and automatically goes right into the invoice.
[01:31:47.420 --> 01:31:48.420]   So that's cool.
[01:31:48.420 --> 01:31:49.420]   So here's the deal.
[01:31:49.420 --> 01:31:52.420]   I want you to try FreshBooks right now.
[01:31:52.420 --> 01:31:57.420]   The free trial up to three clients free.
[01:31:57.420 --> 01:32:02.420]   Once you try it, you can upgrade, of course, to many more clients, twenty-five clients, twenty bucks a month.
[01:32:02.420 --> 01:32:04.420]   It takes about a minute to set up account.
[01:32:04.420 --> 01:32:07.420]   And the first three are free at freshbooks.com.
[01:32:07.420 --> 01:32:12.420]   And don't forget every week FreshBooks is giving away a birthday cake to one of our audience members.
[01:32:12.420 --> 01:32:14.420]   It doesn't have to be your birthday to win the cake.
[01:32:14.420 --> 01:32:15.420]   It's yummy.
[01:32:15.420 --> 01:32:18.420]   You just have to sign up for FreshBooks and mention that you heard it on Macbreak Weekly.
[01:32:18.420 --> 01:32:23.420]   FreshBooks.com makes invoicing easier.
[01:32:23.420 --> 01:32:24.420]   And take my word for it.
[01:32:24.420 --> 01:32:26.420]   I used it for years.
[01:32:26.420 --> 01:32:33.420]   Now it is time for, and if we can do this quickly, I'd appreciate it because we're getting ready for a Twitch photo in just a minute or two.
[01:32:33.420 --> 01:32:36.420]   First, let's start with our...
[01:32:36.420 --> 01:32:38.420]   You do iOS or Lion?
[01:32:38.420 --> 01:32:39.420]   I can't remember.
[01:32:39.420 --> 01:32:41.420]   iOS, Alex Lindsey's iOS tip of the week.
[01:32:41.420 --> 01:32:42.420]   So here's my iOS tip of the week.
[01:32:42.420 --> 01:32:43.420]   He's got his iOS or?
[01:32:43.420 --> 01:32:45.420]   I got my iOS tool here.
[01:32:45.420 --> 01:32:49.420]   And the thing, all I want to say is that the iOS tip of the week is to remember.
[01:32:49.420 --> 01:32:52.420]   And this comes back to the Apple thing that we were just talking about.
[01:32:52.420 --> 01:32:55.420]   Is that you always remember not to forget.
[01:32:55.420 --> 01:32:59.420]   Always remember that your find your iPhone is not on when you buy it.
[01:32:59.420 --> 01:33:03.420]   So this is my wife misplaced her phone.
[01:33:03.420 --> 01:33:07.420]   And I just had someone misplaced their iPad over last week during Dreamforce.
[01:33:07.420 --> 01:33:08.420]   And we actually found it.
[01:33:08.420 --> 01:33:09.420]   I said, "Do you have your find your iPhone on?"
[01:33:09.420 --> 01:33:10.420]   And he's like, "Yeah, I have a find."
[01:33:10.420 --> 01:33:12.420]   And we saw it in the West End.
[01:33:12.420 --> 01:33:13.420]   And we saw it moving around.
[01:33:13.420 --> 01:33:15.420]   And turned out it was someone else that picked it up for him.
[01:33:15.420 --> 01:33:17.420]   But the point is, is that you know where it is.
[01:33:17.420 --> 01:33:18.420]   You have to turn this on.
[01:33:18.420 --> 01:33:20.420]   So what that means is you have to go to mobile.
[01:33:20.420 --> 01:33:21.420]   You have to sign up with a mobile mean.
[01:33:21.420 --> 01:33:22.420]   Now you don't have to have mobile mean.
[01:33:22.420 --> 01:33:23.420]   You can use your iTunes account.
[01:33:23.420 --> 01:33:24.420]   That's not as free now.
[01:33:24.420 --> 01:33:25.420]   It's free.
[01:33:25.420 --> 01:33:26.420]   So you can do your iTunes account.
[01:33:26.420 --> 01:33:28.420]   And then you're going to go into your mobile mean settings.
[01:33:28.420 --> 01:33:30.420]   And you're going to turn find my iPhone on.
[01:33:30.420 --> 01:33:32.420]   Now you still need to log in.
[01:33:32.420 --> 01:33:33.420]   It's secure, log in.
[01:33:33.420 --> 01:33:35.420]   It's as secure as anything else.
[01:33:35.420 --> 01:33:38.420]   It is definitely worth turning on.
[01:33:38.420 --> 01:33:39.420]   I lost my...
[01:33:39.420 --> 01:33:42.420]   When they first did this, I turned it on on one of my phones.
[01:33:42.420 --> 01:33:45.420]   And I literally came up to a cab that I left my phone in and said,
[01:33:45.420 --> 01:33:46.420]   "You have my phone.
[01:33:46.420 --> 01:33:48.420]   I had to track them down."
[01:33:48.420 --> 01:33:49.420]   But you've...
[01:33:49.420 --> 01:33:50.420]   You might not have gotten it.
[01:33:50.420 --> 01:33:51.420]   Had you not done that right away.
[01:33:51.420 --> 01:33:52.420]   So it's good to do that.
[01:33:52.420 --> 01:33:53.420]   No, so the thing is that you...
[01:33:53.420 --> 01:33:54.420]   Yeah, I mean you're trying to call it.
[01:33:54.420 --> 01:33:55.420]   Do it right away.
[01:33:55.420 --> 01:33:56.420]   So the thing is, is find my iPhone.
[01:33:56.420 --> 01:33:57.420]   You've got to turn it on.
[01:33:57.420 --> 01:33:59.420]   You can't turn it on later.
[01:33:59.420 --> 01:34:01.420]   And that's my big tip.
[01:34:01.420 --> 01:34:02.420]   Absolutely.
[01:34:02.420 --> 01:34:04.420]   And parents, it's a great way to track your teenagers.
[01:34:04.420 --> 01:34:05.420]   I didn't want to talk about that.
[01:34:05.420 --> 01:34:06.420]   Don't tell them.
[01:34:06.420 --> 01:34:08.420]   But it's true.
[01:34:08.420 --> 01:34:09.420]   It's true.
[01:34:09.420 --> 01:34:13.420]   It's true.
[01:34:13.420 --> 01:34:14.420]   Life saved.
[01:34:14.420 --> 01:34:17.420]   Did you find your car once where you forgot where you had parked it,
[01:34:17.420 --> 01:34:19.420]   but you had your iPhone in it, so you just followed your iPhone.
[01:34:19.420 --> 01:34:20.420]   No, I didn't have my iPhone.
[01:34:20.420 --> 01:34:21.420]   Oh, if you had...
[01:34:21.420 --> 01:34:22.420]   I would have saved you.
[01:34:22.420 --> 01:34:23.420]   I would have saved you.
[01:34:23.420 --> 01:34:24.420]   I would have saved you.
[01:34:24.420 --> 01:34:25.420]   It would have saved me a lot of people.
[01:34:25.420 --> 01:34:26.420]   That's right.
[01:34:26.420 --> 01:34:27.420]   At least found your car.
[01:34:27.420 --> 01:34:28.420]   Never mind.
[01:34:28.420 --> 01:34:29.420]   Never mind.
[01:34:29.420 --> 01:34:30.420]   At the liquor store.
[01:34:30.420 --> 01:34:31.420]   Oops!
[01:34:31.420 --> 01:34:32.420]   My car's been stolen!
[01:34:32.420 --> 01:34:33.420]   Oh, sir, we have it.
[01:34:33.420 --> 01:34:34.420]   Just down the street.
[01:34:34.420 --> 01:34:35.420]   See?
[01:34:35.420 --> 01:34:36.420]   Look out your window.
[01:34:36.420 --> 01:34:37.420]   Over here.
[01:34:37.420 --> 01:34:38.420]   Andy and that goes l'yonti.
[01:34:38.420 --> 01:34:43.420]   This is a line specific tip and something that I wanted.
[01:34:43.420 --> 01:34:46.420]   It's such a simple thing to something I've wanted for so many years.
[01:34:46.420 --> 01:34:51.420]   A quick time player, which is one of the unsung heroes of the free apps you get with
[01:34:51.420 --> 01:34:54.420]   Lion, added a new feature to their export list.
[01:34:54.420 --> 01:34:58.420]   Now, in addition to exporting a video into a whole bunch of different YouTube formats,
[01:34:58.420 --> 01:35:01.420]   it can also export it as an audio file.
[01:35:01.420 --> 01:35:04.420]   And why would you want to export something as an audio file?
[01:35:04.420 --> 01:35:07.420]   Well, because you know what?
[01:35:07.420 --> 01:35:10.420]   You may have seen Raiders of the Lost Ark or Star Wars before.
[01:35:10.420 --> 01:35:14.420]   So it's possible that after having seen it 30 times, you don't actually need the
[01:35:14.420 --> 01:35:16.420]   pictures to follow the story.
[01:35:16.420 --> 01:35:20.420]   And so essentially it gives you the ability to take all of these video files you
[01:35:20.420 --> 01:35:26.420]   converted from DVD and on a selective basis convert them into essentially audio books.
[01:35:26.420 --> 01:35:31.420]   Just last week I converted one of my favorite old movies Shadow of the Thin Man.
[01:35:31.420 --> 01:35:33.420]   Just stripped out way all the video turned into a very...
[01:35:33.420 --> 01:35:41.420]   It turned into a very compact, like 90-minute beautiful radio play with music and
[01:35:41.420 --> 01:35:42.420]   and shemp-houred in the background.
[01:35:42.420 --> 01:35:44.420]   All these really, really cool things.
[01:35:44.420 --> 01:35:48.420]   And it is a great, cool, just built-in feature of QuickTime Player.
[01:35:48.420 --> 01:35:50.420]   QuickTime Player does a whole bunch of really cool things.
[01:35:50.420 --> 01:35:54.420]   I'm sure that in the coming months I will be tipping into QuickTime Player
[01:35:54.420 --> 01:35:58.420]   as for tips because it just does a million things and it's free.
[01:35:58.420 --> 01:36:02.420]   And it will often save you from having to spend $4.99 on a simple one-use utility
[01:36:02.420 --> 01:36:04.420]   that you might get from the App Store.
[01:36:04.420 --> 01:36:08.420]   But just the ability to convert videos from sound and vision to just sound,
[01:36:08.420 --> 01:36:12.420]   just completely extends what you can do with your media content.
[01:36:12.420 --> 01:36:15.420]   Now it's not going to work on protective content, so it's not as so you can buy an
[01:36:15.420 --> 01:36:21.420]   episode of "House" and then strip out the audio and just use that as an unprotected MP3 or MP4 file.
[01:36:21.420 --> 01:36:24.420]   But you're not really buying stuff online, are you?
[01:36:24.420 --> 01:36:27.420]   Anyway, you're buying the DVD and ripping it.
[01:36:27.420 --> 01:36:28.420]   Of course you are.
[01:36:28.420 --> 01:36:30.420]   So the QuickTime Player is going to be the great solution.
[01:36:30.420 --> 01:36:33.420]   I want to do that. I have actually all the DVDs of the ThinMan.
[01:36:33.420 --> 01:36:35.420]   I got the ThinMan set.
[01:36:35.420 --> 01:36:36.420]   What a great idea.
[01:36:36.420 --> 01:36:39.420]   Convert them to audio and I can listen to my iPod.
[01:36:39.420 --> 01:36:41.420]   Thank you, Andy and Nodco.
[01:36:41.420 --> 01:36:42.420]   Now time for our tips of the week.
[01:36:42.420 --> 01:36:44.420]   I'll start and it's a quick tip.
[01:36:44.420 --> 01:36:48.420]   Sonos this morning sent out an alert to everybody using a Sonos Player.
[01:36:48.420 --> 01:36:53.420]   If you've gone tired as a lion user of getting this message,
[01:36:53.420 --> 01:36:57.420]   you are running a version of always gender, maybe incompatible with Sonos.
[01:36:57.420 --> 01:37:00.420]   Don't worry, fear not, go to the Sonos Support page.
[01:37:00.420 --> 01:37:03.420]   You won't get the automatic update by the way.
[01:37:03.420 --> 01:37:05.420]   You have to actually click this.
[01:37:05.420 --> 01:37:07.420]   At least it's been my experience.
[01:37:07.420 --> 01:37:12.420]   Click this and you'll get 3.5.2 of the Sonos desktop controller,
[01:37:12.420 --> 01:37:14.420]   which now works beautifully with lion.
[01:37:14.420 --> 01:37:16.420]   You'll also have to update all your Sonos hardware.
[01:37:16.420 --> 01:37:18.420]   I think we've talked about Sonos before.
[01:37:18.420 --> 01:37:19.420]   I'm a big fan.
[01:37:19.420 --> 01:37:24.420]   In fact, we have six Sonos players in our studio, which is great for party mode,
[01:37:24.420 --> 01:37:28.420]   including the S5 and S3 player on the front desk.
[01:37:28.420 --> 01:37:30.420]   It's just, I love Sonos.
[01:37:30.420 --> 01:37:34.420]   So if you've been worried or suffering with lion and Sonos, good news.
[01:37:34.420 --> 01:37:36.420]   They have updated it.
[01:37:36.420 --> 01:37:38.420]   Now, Alex, Lindsey, you are pick of the week.
[01:37:38.420 --> 01:37:41.420]   So my pick of the week is a program called Playback Pro.
[01:37:41.420 --> 01:37:42.420]   Yes.
[01:37:42.420 --> 01:37:46.420]   And this is a program that I bought yesterday,
[01:37:46.420 --> 01:37:49.420]   or not yesterday, last week, before we started doing Dreamforce.
[01:37:49.420 --> 01:37:53.420]   We've been doing a lot of our lower thirds in graphics with keynote,
[01:37:53.420 --> 01:37:57.420]   actually, and we realized the complexity of our show was going to be way too much.
[01:37:57.420 --> 01:37:59.420]   And so we got Playback Pro.
[01:37:59.420 --> 01:38:02.420]   And Playback Pro is basically the standard in presentation,
[01:38:02.420 --> 01:38:06.420]   like so companies doing presentations and so on and so forth to Playback videos.
[01:38:06.420 --> 01:38:12.420]   What it does is it simply allows you to build a large playlist.
[01:38:12.420 --> 01:38:15.420]   So you can build a huge playlist of all the movies you want to play
[01:38:15.420 --> 01:38:17.420]   and you can decide how they're linked.
[01:38:17.420 --> 01:38:19.420]   Do I, at the end of this movie, do I want to go to the next one?
[01:38:19.420 --> 01:38:20.420]   Do I want to stop?
[01:38:20.420 --> 01:38:21.420]   Do I want to...
[01:38:21.420 --> 01:38:22.420]   We could use this to do our reruns.
[01:38:22.420 --> 01:38:23.420]   Yes, you could.
[01:38:23.420 --> 01:38:28.420]   So anyway, yeah, but basically we were running our lower thirds with it.
[01:38:28.420 --> 01:38:30.420]   We were running, and then we'd have stacks of movies.
[01:38:30.420 --> 01:38:32.420]   So we'd have like eight movies that we want to play,
[01:38:32.420 --> 01:38:34.420]   and we're simply link, link, link, link, link.
[01:38:34.420 --> 01:38:37.420]   You can have them cross-fade between the two as they link.
[01:38:37.420 --> 01:38:40.420]   And what it's doing is it's caching that software.
[01:38:40.420 --> 01:38:47.420]   It's caching the movie into RAM so that it's not dropping frames and so on and so forth.
[01:38:47.420 --> 01:38:56.420]   It is the other thing that it does really well is that it takes over your second display output.
[01:38:56.420 --> 01:39:00.420]   So it says, "Okay, I don't care what the system says you should be doing."
[01:39:00.420 --> 01:39:01.420]   It's mine.
[01:39:01.420 --> 01:39:04.420]   It's going to be exactly 720p, or it's going to be exactly smart.
[01:39:04.420 --> 01:39:07.420]   This has always been a problem that we've had as we hook up and we can't figure out,
[01:39:07.420 --> 01:39:11.420]   you know, we have to do this dance, so trying to set up our second display
[01:39:11.420 --> 01:39:14.420]   so that our playback will go into our mixer correctly or it'll go into a projector.
[01:39:14.420 --> 01:39:16.420]   This just says, "This is the way it's coming out."
[01:39:16.420 --> 01:39:18.420]   You know, and it doesn't top down.
[01:39:18.420 --> 01:39:25.420]   And so it is -- I think that the basic version is a couple of three or four hundred dollars
[01:39:25.420 --> 01:39:28.420]   or two or three hundred dollars, and the pro version I think is 600.
[01:39:28.420 --> 01:39:34.420]   And you know, you just have to decide which one you want as far as how it goes.
[01:39:34.420 --> 01:39:39.420]   But if you're looking for something like this, we hit it really, really hard last week,
[01:39:39.420 --> 01:39:41.420]   and it totally saved us.
[01:39:41.420 --> 01:39:42.420]   You know, and so --
[01:39:42.420 --> 01:39:47.420]   You know, we started using Tools on Air, which is a very expensive Swiss television automation system
[01:39:47.420 --> 01:39:50.420]   to do our reruns, but this could do a pretty --
[01:39:50.420 --> 01:39:52.420]   The advantage that Tools on Air has is that it --
[01:39:52.420 --> 01:39:53.420]   We can do courts.
[01:39:53.420 --> 01:39:54.420]   We can do courtslayer.
[01:39:54.420 --> 01:39:55.420]   Well, you have courtslayer.
[01:39:55.420 --> 01:40:00.420]   This won't let you do the Tools on Air does is let you add all of those courtslayer on top.
[01:40:00.420 --> 01:40:02.420]   If you're just simply doing playback --
[01:40:02.420 --> 01:40:04.420]   Playback video after video after video after video.
[01:40:04.420 --> 01:40:05.420]   After video after video after video after video.
[01:40:05.420 --> 01:40:06.420]   Which is really essentially all we need to do.
[01:40:06.420 --> 01:40:07.420]   Right now.
[01:40:07.420 --> 01:40:13.420]   Yeah, and the advantage that this has over Tools on Air is also very much built for a structured schedule.
[01:40:13.420 --> 01:40:17.420]   You know, I'm going to start at top one o'clock and I'm going to go to two, and then I'm going to have holes at certain points.
[01:40:17.420 --> 01:40:19.420]   This one just stacks up.
[01:40:19.420 --> 01:40:20.420]   You know, and then you just hit links.
[01:40:20.420 --> 01:40:21.420]   And what we had is --
[01:40:21.420 --> 01:40:24.420]   We actually do a better job for us since all of our shows are at variable lengths.
[01:40:24.420 --> 01:40:27.420]   Well, and then what we would do is we had a whole bunch of sweepers that we wanted to pop in.
[01:40:27.420 --> 01:40:30.420]   So what we would do is we'd have three movies, and then I'd have a sweeper.
[01:40:30.420 --> 01:40:31.420]   Right.
[01:40:31.420 --> 01:40:32.420]   And then I'd have another three movies, and I'd link them all down.
[01:40:32.420 --> 01:40:33.420]   Right.
[01:40:33.420 --> 01:40:35.420]   And you could have them loop or link or stop or whatever you want.
[01:40:35.420 --> 01:40:38.420]   And it turned out to be just a great application.
[01:40:38.420 --> 01:40:40.420]   So anyway, that's a DT playback.
[01:40:40.420 --> 01:40:44.420]   And finally, Andy, and not go with his pick of the weekend room.
[01:40:44.420 --> 01:40:49.420]   My pick of the week is the Comixology app for iPad.
[01:40:49.420 --> 01:40:51.420]   For two important reasons.
[01:40:51.420 --> 01:40:58.420]   Number one, they've done some updates that make it -- it was already a really good app for buying and reading comics.
[01:40:58.420 --> 01:41:04.420]   And so I like it because it's a very, very iPad looking app.
[01:41:04.420 --> 01:41:08.420]   It's not just -- we have a business plan that says that we have to have a tablet presence in the marketplace.
[01:41:08.420 --> 01:41:14.420]   And therefore, we decided to design a layout that could be deployed both as flash on a website and also a -- no.
[01:41:14.420 --> 01:41:18.420]   They developed an actual damn iPad app here.
[01:41:18.420 --> 01:41:21.420]   And also, they also were very -- it's amazing.
[01:41:21.420 --> 01:41:26.420]   But I've been a Comix reader since I was in high school.
[01:41:26.420 --> 01:41:33.420]   And it's amazing that when I talk about these apps, I mostly talk about here's how you screw it up.
[01:41:33.420 --> 01:41:37.420]   And when I say nice things about apps, it's like here is how you did not screw this up.
[01:41:37.420 --> 01:41:47.420]   Marvel Comics vs. Online has this really stupid reader that says no, we want to make digital comics with zazs and camera moves and animation.
[01:41:47.420 --> 01:41:53.420]   The Comixology app, it just -- if you want to have it navigate from panel to panel for you, it will do that for you.
[01:41:53.420 --> 01:41:56.420]   But if you just want to read it as a comic book, just turn the pages.
[01:41:56.420 --> 01:41:58.420]   It will let you turn the pages.
[01:41:58.420 --> 01:42:04.420]   And when you have a double page splash like this, it will automatically go -- it will go boom like that.
[01:42:04.420 --> 01:42:07.420]   You can also, of course, zoom in, zoom out for better reading.
[01:42:07.420 --> 01:42:09.420]   So, great app.
[01:42:09.420 --> 01:42:22.420]   But the other thing is that DC Comics is sort of a piggyback recommendation here because they are the first company that seems to have decided that this iPad thing could really take off.
[01:42:22.420 --> 01:42:30.420]   You know, given enough time and given support from a large company, maybe tablets are going to be a good -- or maybe digital publishing is a good way to distribute their content.
[01:42:30.420 --> 01:42:34.420]   So, they've done two really huge things.
[01:42:34.420 --> 01:42:44.420]   Number one, they've decided that starting in September, every single comic they sell on the newsstand and comic book shops will be available day and date available for the comics office.
[01:42:44.420 --> 01:42:45.420]   You're kidding.
[01:42:45.420 --> 01:42:47.420]   That's great news.
[01:42:47.420 --> 01:42:52.420]   So, see, Marvel has been sort of taking babies -- I don't mean this to be anti-marble.
[01:42:52.420 --> 01:42:54.420]   I'm just saying I don't think they're doing things correctly.
[01:42:54.420 --> 01:42:56.420]   Marvel has been taking baby steps.
[01:42:56.420 --> 01:42:59.420]   Well, okay, maybe this Spider-Man book.
[01:42:59.420 --> 01:43:01.420]   We'll let you have this Spider-Man book.
[01:43:01.420 --> 01:43:03.420]   But how about a comic that came out 20 years ago?
[01:43:03.420 --> 01:43:05.420]   Yeah, we'll give you that.
[01:43:05.420 --> 01:43:11.420]   We'll make sure that this run is only available in our special Flash player that you have to purchase via subscription.
[01:43:11.420 --> 01:43:12.420]   I'm like, you know what?
[01:43:12.420 --> 01:43:13.420]   Why even bother?
[01:43:13.420 --> 01:43:16.420]   If I don't know that a comic is available, I'm not going to keep coming back.
[01:43:16.420 --> 01:43:23.420]   There's a store nearby that I don't shop at because I will go on Wednesday, new comic book day, and say, oh, we didn't order that.
[01:43:23.420 --> 01:43:25.420]   Oh, how about like Superman?
[01:43:25.420 --> 01:43:29.420]   Well, we only ordered two copies and we opened an hour ago and now we're all sold out.
[01:43:29.420 --> 01:43:30.420]   That's why I don't go to the store.
[01:43:30.420 --> 01:43:33.420]   That's why I don't use the Dark Horse comics app.
[01:43:33.420 --> 01:43:35.420]   I don't buy Marvel comics.
[01:43:35.420 --> 01:43:39.420]   Not because I don't like them, but because why am I going to bother every week to see what they decided to post?
[01:43:39.420 --> 01:43:43.420]   With DC, they decided every single thing we sell is going to be available online.
[01:43:43.420 --> 01:43:46.420]   The actual shipping data of everything else.
[01:43:46.420 --> 01:43:53.420]   Now to that double smart, which is kind of interesting, they also decided to reboot their entire universe
[01:43:53.420 --> 01:43:56.420]   so that it all starts over again in September.
[01:43:56.420 --> 01:44:04.420]   So if you pick up Justice League number one, you don't have to figure out, well, why are Nazis in robot costumes
[01:44:04.420 --> 01:44:08.420]   attacking Wonder Woman and why does Wonder Woman not think that she's Wonder Woman?
[01:44:08.420 --> 01:44:11.420]   Why does she think that she's a teenage girl who was orphaned?
[01:44:11.420 --> 01:44:13.420]   There's not all this backstory going on.
[01:44:13.420 --> 01:44:16.420]   Essentially, everything starts all over again from issues number one.
[01:44:16.420 --> 01:44:17.420]   Batman is still Batman.
[01:44:17.420 --> 01:44:18.420]   Superman is still Superman.
[01:44:18.420 --> 01:44:23.420]   It starts with their starting fresh without any of the baggage that's been built up over the past five or ten years.
[01:44:23.420 --> 01:44:25.420]   Every single major comic book company.
[01:44:25.420 --> 01:44:31.420]   Now, unfortunately, what really sells are these mega crossover events where you can't pick up a comic
[01:44:31.420 --> 01:44:37.420]   and have any idea what's going on unless you've been reading this for, you've been reading all 20 issues per month
[01:44:37.420 --> 01:44:39.420]   but they're involved in the storyline.
[01:44:39.420 --> 01:44:46.420]   So this is a very deliberate chance to simply say, we appreciate that digital is going to be a bigger and bigger presence
[01:44:46.420 --> 01:44:47.420]   as the years go by.
[01:44:47.420 --> 01:44:49.420]   Maybe not initially, but it's going to be a big deal.
[01:44:49.420 --> 01:44:51.420]   The sooner we really commit to it, the better.
[01:44:51.420 --> 01:44:57.420]   And also, we're going to simply say that if you have been thinking about getting into comics, September of 2011
[01:44:57.420 --> 01:44:58.420]   is a really good month to get in.
[01:44:58.420 --> 01:44:59.420]   That's kind of cool.
[01:44:59.420 --> 01:45:00.420]   That's great.
[01:45:00.420 --> 01:45:02.420]   Everything with the DC logo on it, it's brand new.
[01:45:02.420 --> 01:45:06.420]   You don't have to know anything about it except for what we will present to you.
[01:45:06.420 --> 01:45:09.420]   Justice League is really, really great.
[01:45:09.420 --> 01:45:11.420]   It looks good, I got to say.
[01:45:11.420 --> 01:45:19.420]   I mean, it's a written by, drawn by Jim Lee, who has the most hellacious, he is the James Cameron of artists
[01:45:19.420 --> 01:45:26.420]   where if you give him 22 pages of solid action, he will absolutely sell every single panel of it.
[01:45:26.420 --> 01:45:32.420]   There are other books where you can have Nazis piloting huge robot skeleton armor laying waste to thousands of people
[01:45:32.420 --> 01:45:34.420]   and it seems like an indie movie.
[01:45:34.420 --> 01:45:35.420]   That's not the way that Jim Lee.
[01:45:35.420 --> 01:45:36.420]   That's not how he wrote it.
[01:45:36.420 --> 01:45:39.420]   He will sell every single panel of it.
[01:45:39.420 --> 01:45:41.420]   So that's the first issue that I actually bought.
[01:45:41.420 --> 01:45:45.420]   And that basically said, "Okay, this reboot might work out well for me and my interest.
[01:45:45.420 --> 01:45:48.420]   I will follow your future career with conservative interest, Mr. Lee."
[01:45:48.420 --> 01:45:53.420]   And I have to say, reading a comic on an iPad, no, I'm not a big, you're the comic book guy,
[01:45:53.420 --> 01:45:55.420]   but it's a pretty satisfying experience for me.
[01:45:55.420 --> 01:45:56.420]   I like it.
[01:45:56.420 --> 01:45:57.420]   Absolutely.
[01:45:57.420 --> 01:46:00.420]   I mean, I know the ink doesn't rub off on your fingers or anything, but I just like it.
[01:46:00.420 --> 01:46:01.420]   I like it.
[01:46:01.420 --> 01:46:07.420]   I actually prefer it because it's the one piece of entertainment that I can't get digitally,
[01:46:07.420 --> 01:46:13.420]   which means that it's the one piece of entertainment that I'll buy my comics on Wednesday or Thursday
[01:46:13.420 --> 01:46:15.420]   whenever I happen to come to the store.
[01:46:15.420 --> 01:46:20.420]   I will read them within one or two hours and then probably I will not have it to be able to read them ever again
[01:46:20.420 --> 01:46:25.420]   until I'm trade paperback form like three months later because you just can't keep these things.
[01:46:25.420 --> 01:46:30.420]   I mean, if I were a bigger nerd than I am, I would have a keyboard and bag that I would have.
[01:46:30.420 --> 01:46:32.420]   I'm bored in bag this one.
[01:46:32.420 --> 01:46:34.420]   Here's the reading copy.
[01:46:34.420 --> 01:46:36.420]   I will file this numerically.
[01:46:36.420 --> 01:46:42.420]   Unfortunately, after so many years of having long box after long box of comics that I don't read ever again,
[01:46:42.420 --> 01:46:46.420]   it's like, "Okay, tell you what, if it's really, really great, I'll put it in this special box otherwise I'll throw it away."
[01:46:46.420 --> 01:46:51.420]   Now I can be on a plane and finish whatever Kindle book that I wanted to finish.
[01:46:51.420 --> 01:46:55.420]   I've got 30 minutes left and I can go back and read some Galsamone books.
[01:46:55.420 --> 01:47:00.420]   I can go back and read her one of her Wonder Woman arcs where I can go back and read some Sandman
[01:47:00.420 --> 01:47:03.420]   and it will just work out hunky-dory.
[01:47:03.420 --> 01:47:08.420]   I really want to reward DC Comics for finally saying we are going to commit to this.
[01:47:08.420 --> 01:47:15.420]   Even if we don't sell a whole lot to begin with, on principle, every comic that we sell will be available digitally.
[01:47:15.420 --> 01:47:18.420]   The only downside is that the cover price is the same.
[01:47:18.420 --> 01:47:23.420]   So you're still spending $3.99 for this comic, but okay, I'll take that.
[01:47:23.420 --> 01:47:26.420]   So it's all being done through in-app purchasing.
[01:47:26.420 --> 01:47:29.420]   So you tap one button, you tap the confirmation button.
[01:47:29.420 --> 01:47:34.420]   If you're signed in to your iTunes account, it gets downloaded, you get to start reading it, it could not be simpler.
[01:47:34.420 --> 01:47:37.420]   Andy Naco, comic nerd.
[01:47:37.420 --> 01:47:39.420]   Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for being here.
[01:47:39.420 --> 01:47:49.420]   Celeste Joe Waste of Ban with his personal site, www.cwob.com, but of course you can read his professional works in the esteemed Chicago Sun Times.
[01:47:49.420 --> 01:47:54.420]   Yes, also follow him on Twitter, I-H-N-A-T-K.
[01:47:54.420 --> 01:47:55.420]   Oh!
[01:47:55.420 --> 01:47:56.420]   Correct.
[01:47:56.420 --> 01:47:57.420]   Oh!
[01:47:57.420 --> 01:48:03.420]   Alex Lindsey is the man in charge of the Pixelcore, that great guild of 3D artists working and learning together.
[01:48:03.420 --> 01:48:08.420]   Pixelcore.com, Pixelcore.com/live is every Thursday night, the place to go.
[01:48:08.420 --> 01:48:12.420]   And we're going to be talking about how we did what we did with Dreamforce.
[01:48:12.420 --> 01:48:13.420]   Oh, that'd be fun.
[01:48:13.420 --> 01:48:18.420]   We're talking about some of the studio stuff for a couple photos and talk about how we, as part of Gear Media Tech Live.
[01:48:18.420 --> 01:48:23.420]   So we're going to, that's this Thursday at 6, follow either me or Pixelcore.
[01:48:23.420 --> 01:48:26.420]   Me, if you want the silly stuff in Pixelcore, if you just want to be-
[01:48:26.420 --> 01:48:28.420]   Me being Alex Lindsey.
[01:48:28.420 --> 01:48:29.420]   Alex Lindsey.
[01:48:29.420 --> 01:48:32.420]   But if you want to hear just the announcements, follow Pixelcore.
[01:48:32.420 --> 01:48:33.420]   @Pixelcore.
[01:48:33.420 --> 01:48:34.420]   Yes.
[01:48:34.420 --> 01:48:35.420]   So you're a FPS.
[01:48:35.420 --> 01:48:36.420]   Yes.
[01:48:36.420 --> 01:48:38.420]   No E for the Dexter fans.
[01:48:38.420 --> 01:48:40.420]   Thank you all for being here.
[01:48:40.420 --> 01:48:43.420]   We do this show 11 a.m. or when Leo gets here.
[01:48:43.420 --> 01:48:46.420]   Pacific 2 p.m. Eastern at Live.
[01:48:46.420 --> 01:48:48.420]   Actually, I don't have to say live anymore at our new site.
[01:48:48.420 --> 01:48:49.420]   Twit.tv.
[01:48:49.420 --> 01:48:50.420]   It's all there.
[01:48:50.420 --> 01:48:52.420]   Everything's there, including our live video.
[01:48:52.420 --> 01:48:54.420]   TWIT.tv.
[01:48:54.420 --> 01:48:59.420]   11 a.m. 2 p.m. and that would be 1800 UTC if you're outside the US.
[01:48:59.420 --> 01:49:00.420]   It's easier to figure that out.
[01:49:00.420 --> 01:49:02.420]   And of course you can always get it after the fact.
[01:49:02.420 --> 01:49:08.420]   Because we record it and we take the audio and video and make it available to you at absolutely no charge.
[01:49:08.420 --> 01:49:09.420]   That's crazy.
[01:49:09.420 --> 01:49:11.420]   I know it's nuts on iTunes and everywhere else.
[01:49:11.420 --> 01:49:14.420]   Well, it's thanks to our great advertisers that we can do that.
[01:49:14.420 --> 01:49:15.420]   I hope you'll join us next week.
[01:49:15.420 --> 01:49:19.420]   But now you better get back to work because break time my friend is over.
[01:49:19.420 --> 01:49:29.420]   [Music]
