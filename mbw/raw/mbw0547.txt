[00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:04.400]   He's up in Montreal
[00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:05.840]   Hello Renee
[00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:10.400]   Oh Leo, it's like plus five degrees everything is melted. It's supposed to be - 30. I don't know how to
[00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:16.160]   Ball me balmy weather. I just I just hope we're not flooding you guys with tons and tons of of
[00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:20.720]   Melted to know right now. So in my head I'm multiplying
[00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:25.280]   So I'm adding 32 that's 37 and multiplying it's above freezing
[00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:31.040]   It's it's never above usually it's it's zero Fahrenheit at this time of year and right now. It's above freezing. Wow
[00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:33.120]   Yeah, wow
[00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:38.720]   And and the anacos here he's in the the pacific the pacific the Atlantic northeast
[00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:43.760]   He's specific in the sense that we're peaceful peaceful peaceful the peaceful Atlantic northeast
[00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:48.880]   uh, he's with the Chicago Sun times and both of course are regulars as we
[00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:53.120]   Could join each Tuesday to on fab
[00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:57.200]   On the Macintosh human centipede of apple news
[00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:00.320]   Oh, no
[00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:04.720]   You know, I never well, I don't know. I never seen it because no, that's not I trust my instincts
[00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:08.880]   Yes, exactly that flicks having a description about it was enough to give me nightmares for a year
[00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:13.520]   Apple buys Israeli facial recognition firm real face
[00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:16.400]   speaking of
[00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:17.600]   centipedes
[00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:18.800]   real face
[00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:22.640]   Uh, and then and then this is a company that does authentication
[00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:25.360]   via face
[00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:27.360]   so the speculation would be
[00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:32.720]   That this is maybe face recognition in the next iphone. What do you think?
[00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:39.600]   And they've had face recognition software for a long time going back to just on the on the mac in iPhoto being able to do face detection
[00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:42.400]   That's different from authentication. That's a separate
[00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:48.400]   Absolutely, but I mean, it's it's something that they've been doing for a long time and coming that they get better and better at and this looks like a logical next step for them
[00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:53.840]   Yeah, but it is something that if you really want the kind of security that matches up with fingerprint authentication
[00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:58.400]   You do need special hardware and so things like having a 3d camera or just basically
[00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:03.440]   Creating a new a face forward camera. That's black and white and has the sort of frame rate and resolution that can
[00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:07.760]   That can tell you not only how many pimples you have but how many pimples you had in high school
[00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:14.800]   But it's exactly infurret in it for that in and out. That's exactly right because uh, that's every I don't ever I have
[00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:24.400]   I don't think I've ever signed into this once I set it up. This is the the windows machine the surface studio. It has windows. Hello. Hello. Hello, and uh, and it recognizes me
[00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:31.360]   And that's awesome. Oh, I like it. I mean, it's you know
[00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:36.960]   Uh, you probably have seen me before the show. I have to make this upright because that's how I
[00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:43.360]   Did the original recognition is like using the global entry machine where you've got a lot get closer go further line up
[00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:47.840]   Look now stare open your eyes wider. That's that's actually a good question because uh
[00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:53.920]   It can be that way and rate had facial recognition a couple of years ago on a number of devices
[00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:58.880]   Including google's uh own nexus devices and it was much like that
[00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:03.520]   And if you were wearing glasses, it wouldn't work if it was a different it was dark and you had done it
[00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:09.600]   So it was not really it was slow samson also had this has I think still has this and it was slow
[00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:14.800]   Uh aspirational it works. I think it's less good for mobile and better for desktop
[00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:20.160]   Uh, and as you point out you have to have a special sensing camera that does uh infra red
[00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:23.680]   Which is what uh, this is a all
[00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:30.160]   Hello compatible machines on windows that have to do face recognition have to have what's called a hello camera
[00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:31.680]   Yeah
[00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:38.800]   Because it's it's the the penalty for this not working is the starts off as it's frustrating to use and the user will turn it off
[00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:45.360]   And it ends with anybody can just get your 8x10 color glossy headshot and get in that way. So that's why it's a really strong thing
[00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:48.240]   anyone at x and mask
[00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:49.360]   Oh
[00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:54.640]   Westward it was pretend to be next and we can pretend to be glorious dynam. Well that raises there's a couple of issues
[00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:56.640]   How how secure is this?
[00:05:56.640 --> 00:06:00.240]   Can it be spoofed? It's convenience. It's a username. It's not a password
[00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:04.080]   And that's why I think they're doing iris detection as well as facial right like they want to start building up multiple
[00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:10.400]   Vectors of authenticity and iris is that global is why global entry you're always doing this because you're you're looking
[00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:12.480]   I mean and iris is a little harder to do
[00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:19.520]   um, but that's that's why 3d cameras are the hardest one to spoof because the amount of the amount of probably you have to go to
[00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:25.120]   To to to to spoof and an adequately implemented 3d camera system is
[00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:29.840]   Much much greater than simply getting out the screwdriver because you're right in front of this computer anyway
[00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:34.320]   And pulling out the hard drive and running away with it. So that that's that's kind of the gold standard for now
[00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:37.440]   Oh, also, I was gonna say that
[00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:44.080]   I I was reminded of how good apple gets at making something so convenient that you would you know
[00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:47.360]   Never want to use anything else. I redeemed a apple gift card
[00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:53.840]   Uh like a physical gift card and as you i've done it in a few in a few months and you i was just blown away once again
[00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:58.000]   By using just the camera on my ipad is that great and and looking forward to just well
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:02.880]   I guess i'll just like hold it up and move it inside the little box it gives me but while I was moving it
[00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:10.560]   It just said nope. I saw I saw like the csi miami sort of it was grabbed and tilted like where it was like 18 frames ago
[00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:15.920]   No, good enough like what really really? Oh, I don't know if that's new and I also were stuff they're looking for
[00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:19.840]   Oh, no, no, it's not new. I'm just I was just using just using that as an example
[00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:23.600]   Oh, no, not that but I mean I was at the restaurant yesterday and I was trying to buy tickets to a show
[00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:28.960]   At the bell center and it didn't take any of the accounts that I had there was no paypal and there was no apple pay
[00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:33.440]   So I said and put a credit card and immediately a little pop-up came and said you want to scan your credit card
[00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:40.480]   And I said sure and then I held my credit card up and scanned and I said and then it gave me all the autocomplete buttons for my address and my telephone number
[00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:44.880]   And I just went tap tap tap and the entire thing was filled and filling those things in on on a mobile device
[00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:48.640]   Has always been a huge pain in the neck and it just gave me it basically used
[00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:56.720]   Serious stuff to fill in everything and I was super happy with it. So facial recognition is often desired because you don't have to do much
[00:07:56.720 --> 00:08:01.200]   Right, you just you're there you sit you sit down and literally on the windows machines
[00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:04.720]   I love it because I'm sitting down and I'm literally as I'm like putting my soda
[00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:08.320]   Like on my on the table and scooching up it has already authenticated to me
[00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:11.920]   And it's like I was unlocked for for two days while I left it alone
[00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:14.160]   So it really has a lot to like big
[00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:16.400]   Yeah
[00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:19.440]   The problem is of course that the iPhone has this really fast
[00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:26.640]   Really good and I we believe very secure system of fingerprint recognition. I don't know if it needs face recognition
[00:08:26.640 --> 00:08:30.560]   I mean especially since you often pick up your phone in such a way that it's
[00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:33.440]   That's that button goes by my pocket, right? You get used to it
[00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:39.200]   Ah, it would be the button goes by by I see where you're also yeah also again
[00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:42.880]   It's winter which means not only gloves but also like my skin is
[00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:46.480]   Dryer because it's not as humid which means at least on my iPad
[00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:52.240]   It's gone from one tap all the time to one two three and sometimes
[00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:58.960]   Yeah, it's not good. All right, so the way face recognition works
[00:08:58.960 --> 00:09:05.200]   Every face I'm reading this is from x dash site.com has numerous distinguishable landmarks
[00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:08.560]   The different peaks and valleys that make up facial features
[00:09:08.560 --> 00:09:12.880]   Look I didn't I didn't have the clearest skin in high school, but I don't have landmarks, okay
[00:09:13.040 --> 00:09:14.880]   You have land
[00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:19.200]   Nicely the distance between the eyes the width of the nose the depth of the eye sockets
[00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:22.160]   The shape of the cheekbones the length of the jawline
[00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:26.720]   These nodal points are measured creating a numeric code called a face print
[00:09:26.720 --> 00:09:31.920]   And then it it puts it in the database and it is you know face time to face print
[00:09:31.920 --> 00:09:39.040]   so um, you know because of its convenience and its speed this is good and of course
[00:09:40.960 --> 00:09:42.960]   You know government surveillance
[00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:46.000]   Police surveillance likes it because you don't have to have any cooperation
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:49.680]   You just have to have somebody walking around without a ski mask on it without a Nixon
[00:09:49.680 --> 00:09:56.720]   Yeah, the company apparently isn't just for authentication. I had read that it was primarily authentication, but
[00:09:56.720 --> 00:09:59.760]   um their first product which is called pickies
[00:09:59.760 --> 00:10:08.000]   Oh dear created a new way to enjoy photos with its recognition software automatically choosing the users best photos from every platform
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.160]   so um
[00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:14.400]   Anyway, this is sort of what the image processor and apples a series chip tries to do already
[00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:16.880]   likely this is
[00:10:16.880 --> 00:10:18.880]   an acquire
[00:10:18.880 --> 00:10:21.040]   Right
[00:10:21.040 --> 00:10:28.000]   Like the future coming slowly but apple went from acquiring authentic to run to pushing out touch ID in a couple of years
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.000]   They're getting very quick about this kind of stuff
[00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:38.000]   Um, so so would you imagine this means that the next iphone will have face recognition or it could just be for photos
[00:10:38.080 --> 00:10:42.400]   It doesn't have to be anything. I think if they can I mean they're always looking at these solutions
[00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:46.320]   And you never know exactly when it's gonna ship because they have to get I touch ID was so
[00:10:46.320 --> 00:10:50.640]   Not last minute, but they they couldn't not get enough sensors to meet demand for that
[00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:54.720]   phones this technology is always cutting edge and that means it could slip a generation or so
[00:10:54.720 --> 00:10:59.760]   But I think they want it as fast as they can have it right and this and then given what would they put on their website
[00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:04.800]   There's a lot of different ways this technical technology could be applied the most obvious is identification
[00:11:05.120 --> 00:11:09.200]   But it's also things like upgrading the photos app so that when you
[00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:13.440]   When you need to enhance an image understands, okay, that is a human face
[00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:17.200]   Not only that but it's a human face that has turned that way and looking slightly upward
[00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:22.720]   So this is where the light should be and I should not when it when this when the user asks for
[00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:26.560]   Uh for more brightness or more or more sharpness
[00:11:26.560 --> 00:11:31.200]   I should be gentle with this area of the image because they don't want the scar
[00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:34.640]   That they got jumping off a refrigerator when they were five years old
[00:11:35.120 --> 00:11:40.000]   To be outlined and and made made made made a more easy to identify
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:47.840]   So this allowed places they can use this and because apple tends apple doesn't buy a company like google bought nest where great
[00:11:47.840 --> 00:11:52.000]   We'll we'll now bankroll your stuff and we'll make sure your stuff works with our stuff. It's no it's
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:57.920]   Ingest to consume nobody else can get it. You will you will serve the you will now serve the collective
[00:11:57.920 --> 00:12:00.400]   And so they could use that technology everywhere
[00:12:01.040 --> 00:12:04.480]   The there's an analyst at jp morgan rod hall who says
[00:12:04.480 --> 00:12:11.120]   That in fact when we go to the next iphone without the built-in hardware fingerprint reader
[00:12:11.120 --> 00:12:18.080]   That apple replace touch id with 3d face recognition. Yeah, it's not credible
[00:12:18.080 --> 00:12:24.400]   I was still I'm still reminded i'd love multiple points of authentication if I can get it. Yeah, like the more the better for me
[00:12:24.400 --> 00:12:27.360]   Yeah, I mean, it's it's nice that you can choose to
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:33.840]   Uh, just like on my iPad I can use touch id because it's really really fast and when that fails I can use a passcode
[00:12:33.840 --> 00:12:39.520]   Not only a passcode but a really really super long passcode that will be will take 80 million years to guess
[00:12:39.520 --> 00:12:46.400]   I would love it if there were as secure of a way of just doing facial recognition again just by whatever whatever it has to happen
[00:12:46.400 --> 00:12:52.320]   So that I never really have to worry about the security of my advice like the the feature that rene
[00:12:52.880 --> 00:12:57.680]   Keeps keeps mentioning just the feature of i'm wearing an apple watch the apple watch has been authenticated
[00:12:57.680 --> 00:13:03.040]   It has not been removed from my wrists. So the phone says, okay. I'm good. Go ahead. You're unlocked
[00:13:03.040 --> 00:13:09.200]   The multiple vectors the jp morgan analyst hall also said that having a 3d
[00:13:09.200 --> 00:13:16.000]   Lazer scanner in an iphone could be beneficial for augmented reality or virtual reality
[00:13:16.640 --> 00:13:23.920]   He says apples likely they eventually open up a 3d scanning api to developers who could use it to do everything from determining your shoes size
[00:13:23.920 --> 00:13:29.760]   For online orders to help you make sure you're properly fitted on your bike. That's an interesting application of this
[00:13:29.760 --> 00:13:37.360]   Yeah, but I don't think that's something that they would they made a big big big brush fire out of deleting a headphone jack saying that we need
[00:13:37.360 --> 00:13:40.000]   As much room as possible. I don't think that they would do it
[00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:42.080]   I think that they would add
[00:13:42.080 --> 00:13:46.080]   A pair of 3d cameras to the front to make authentication much easier
[00:13:46.080 --> 00:13:51.760]   I don't think that they would do that for a feature that they don't think is going to revolutionize the device
[00:13:51.760 --> 00:13:53.680]   And I don't think that 3d scanning is going to do that
[00:13:53.680 --> 00:13:59.280]   But having some sort of a 3d capture would be a really really good api to add so that you can just
[00:13:59.280 --> 00:14:01.360]   Toss the
[00:14:01.360 --> 00:14:04.800]   Toss the phone inside a shoe that has good depth perception
[00:14:04.800 --> 00:14:11.040]   Multiple cameras and being able to simply wave it around a house to get a read of the room or even capture a 3d object
[00:14:11.440 --> 00:14:15.680]   Um, so you know, there's so many ways they could do that they could have that too. Remember that
[00:14:15.680 --> 00:14:18.000]   uh, I keep thinking about the
[00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:23.360]   The the android fire, excuse me the the fire phone from amazon that was
[00:14:23.360 --> 00:14:29.520]   I was just a huge colossal failure, but it had a lot of interesting ideas that if a more grown-up company
[00:14:29.520 --> 00:14:32.160]   Were to implement them might make a nice phone
[00:14:32.160 --> 00:14:37.440]   They made a for instance one of the things they added to the user interface was they used the three the
[00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:41.760]   Two cameras that had facing forward so they could see not only
[00:14:41.760 --> 00:14:48.880]   Uh, not only 3d of your face, but also get a better idea of where are where are you looking and where is your face in regard to the phone?
[00:14:48.880 --> 00:14:51.520]   So given that iowet one of the design
[00:14:51.520 --> 00:14:56.880]   Pillars of ios is that it's all on layers you have sheets on top of sheets on top of sheets
[00:14:56.880 --> 00:15:00.000]   One way of communicating those layers is transparency
[00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:04.960]   But another way is to give that parallel x effect a little bit but make it actually
[00:15:05.840 --> 00:15:09.760]   actually tie into uh, where the angle of the screen is as opposed to your
[00:15:09.760 --> 00:15:17.520]   In relation to your eyes so there's a lot of if that's putting two cameras facing forward that were just good enough to
[00:15:17.520 --> 00:15:23.200]   Simply get a read of your face that could open up a lot of interesting ideas for user interface as well
[00:15:23.200 --> 00:15:29.040]   Hall might uh have some have a little bit of a credibility gap because he also said
[00:15:29.040 --> 00:15:35.040]   That he thought that they would announce the new phone perhaps at ww dc, which they haven't done
[00:15:35.600 --> 00:15:37.600]   in 10 that seems
[00:15:37.600 --> 00:15:40.080]   On the other hand with all the with a drum beat of rumors
[00:15:40.080 --> 00:15:45.760]   I mean lots of them maybe apple would maybe like to do a little bit of announcing
[00:15:45.760 --> 00:15:48.960]   I see no reason for them to announce in june right they announce
[00:15:48.960 --> 00:15:52.640]   Early only if it's going to take a while to get fcc approval
[00:15:52.640 --> 00:15:57.520]   Yeah, or if they have significant changes for developers, but even then they don't have to show off new hardware
[00:15:57.520 --> 00:16:00.880]   They can just sort of hint at it like they did with size classes before they did the bigger
[00:16:00.880 --> 00:16:05.440]   iPhone they could talk about the next they can talk about ios 11 at ww dc and that would be sufficient
[00:16:05.520 --> 00:16:11.440]   Right, this is this this isn't like google. Io where they will send a thousand developers home with brand new hardware
[00:16:11.440 --> 00:16:15.920]   They think that that's what's required their apple is apple knows they're going to get people on board
[00:16:15.920 --> 00:16:18.400]   And the people that are really really important
[00:16:18.400 --> 00:16:25.280]   They will either be seated beforehand or they will say guess what we've we've got your we've got your room for the next six weeks
[00:16:25.280 --> 00:16:30.400]   At this beautiful beautiful in that's next to the campus so that you can come to this locked office
[00:16:30.880 --> 00:16:35.040]   Eight hours a day to develop your software to make sure it works on the on the latest hardware
[00:16:35.040 --> 00:16:39.360]   So no it would be it would be such a such a huge departure from everything
[00:16:39.360 --> 00:16:42.960]   We know about apple if we were to see any iPhone hardware anytime before september
[00:16:42.960 --> 00:16:46.240]   How about
[00:16:46.240 --> 00:16:49.920]   Uh, let's see red iphons
[00:16:49.920 --> 00:16:53.120]   I'd like red white red iphons would be nice
[00:16:53.120 --> 00:17:00.400]   The uh, like i guess minchi quote is also saying that he thinks that the new 5.8 inch iphone
[00:17:00.800 --> 00:17:08.480]   And by the way 5.8 inch is also speculation. We'll feature quote other biometric technologies that replace the current fink replace
[00:17:08.480 --> 00:17:13.520]   The current fingerprint recognition 5.8 is just going bezel bezel
[00:17:13.520 --> 00:17:16.800]   It's not a it's not a bigger size. It is just going edge to edge on the current iphone
[00:17:16.800 --> 00:17:20.480]   So he says that to distinguish between a larger one or a smaller one
[00:17:20.480 --> 00:17:23.600]   So the seven s and the seven s plus will be pretty much
[00:17:23.600 --> 00:17:27.040]   At least it's assumed they'll be pretty much what we have now just the next generation
[00:17:27.040 --> 00:17:30.560]   But the iphone eight quote unquote or iphone x or iphone whatever they want to call it
[00:17:30.560 --> 00:17:36.720]   iPhone pro would be the same size as an iphone seven but would have edge to edge screen and that sort of works out to 5.8 inches
[00:17:36.720 --> 00:17:38.720]   I do like this that another analyst is
[00:17:38.720 --> 00:17:46.480]   At this point, you know, everybody's just throwing stuff against the wall says that maybe the idea is to create a two-factor verification system
[00:17:46.480 --> 00:17:49.760]   Which I kind of like I kind of like that idea. Yeah, you mentioned that Renee
[00:17:49.760 --> 00:17:52.960]   That's great for a lot of you know, if you don't have to take one out
[00:17:53.280 --> 00:17:57.600]   Can you still do fingerprint recognition if the home button is now an on screen button?
[00:17:57.600 --> 00:18:03.520]   Yeah, the biggest concern for most people is the accessibility because right now it's already a virtual home button
[00:18:03.520 --> 00:18:06.480]   I mean they got rid of the button last year and kind of it's sneaky way
[00:18:06.480 --> 00:18:11.200]   But they left a little dent in it so that people who did have lowered or no vision can still feel it
[00:18:11.200 --> 00:18:15.360]   If it actually goes into the screen because they can just pay of over that and make it a
[00:18:15.360 --> 00:18:20.880]   Sensor but it's yeah, you still have the same say yeah, so the camera would just shoot up through the screen
[00:18:21.520 --> 00:18:23.840]   But again, would you be able to feel that if you had no low vision?
[00:18:23.840 --> 00:18:27.600]   Which is where this new rumor about a sensor area where there would be a sort of a separate area
[00:18:27.600 --> 00:18:31.520]   They're both below where it had virtual buttons that wouldn't necessarily be screen real estate
[00:18:31.520 --> 00:18:36.320]   It could maybe be shaped or feel different enough that people who have lower no vision could still feel it
[00:18:36.320 --> 00:18:38.960]   Yeah, but I'd be I'd be shocked if they haven't
[00:18:38.960 --> 00:18:47.200]   Prototype putting the sensor on the back just like a lot of different android phones do particularly because that's historically where the apple logo goes
[00:18:47.200 --> 00:18:51.280]   So what could be more intimate than you touch the apple logo from the back
[00:18:52.160 --> 00:18:56.000]   Exactly put a little bit more of a little bit of an indentation
[00:18:56.000 --> 00:19:01.200]   It's so there's so many great things that happen when you put something like this on the back of a phone
[00:19:01.200 --> 00:19:06.320]   Even when the first the first motor roll of phone I had that didn't have the touch didn't have the touch sensor there
[00:19:06.320 --> 00:19:09.040]   It was just a little divot such a simple idea
[00:19:09.040 --> 00:19:14.080]   But not only does it allow you to have a round back that will lay flat and not wobble when it's on the table
[00:19:14.080 --> 00:19:19.120]   But also it allows you when you're taking it out of your pocket to orient it in your hand just by feel
[00:19:19.360 --> 00:19:24.320]   So I take it out of my pocket and I know that i'm holding it the right side up instead of upside down
[00:19:24.320 --> 00:19:31.520]   So I'd be shocked if they weren't even considered even considering it given that the by far the most interesting thing they can do
[00:19:31.520 --> 00:19:35.280]   That is practical realistic and has a million benefits
[00:19:35.280 --> 00:19:41.040]   Is to make the screen as keep the keep the phone the same size but make the screen bigger bigger bigger
[00:19:41.040 --> 00:19:48.480]   Which means that anything that is not a screen on your current phone suddenly goes away or finds another place to live
[00:19:49.440 --> 00:19:54.800]   Yeah, all them buttons going by by all name buttons. Let's take a break. We'll come back
[00:19:54.800 --> 00:19:57.680]   I have a question a technical question I got
[00:19:57.680 --> 00:20:03.840]   About the new laptops on the radio show and I did not know the answer fact that they did not know the things that changed about the
[00:20:03.840 --> 00:20:08.160]   Startup chime, but we'll talk about that when we come back our show today brought to you by
[00:20:08.160 --> 00:20:15.040]   Fresh books to use small business person about yay. Hi. No, not that kind of small business a small business
[00:20:15.040 --> 00:20:17.680]   owner
[00:20:17.680 --> 00:20:21.520]   You're not small the business is or maybe you're a medium or a large business owner
[00:20:21.520 --> 00:20:28.960]   I think a lot of people who are a freelancer or you know sole proprietor a lot of people who are you know don't have massive accounting departments
[00:20:28.960 --> 00:20:31.520]   Uh, if you ask them
[00:20:31.520 --> 00:20:37.920]   You know, I mean you've been making a profit this year. They'd go. Yeah, I'll tell you to come tax time
[00:20:37.920 --> 00:20:40.080]   a
[00:20:40.080 --> 00:20:45.040]   If you're a fresh books user on the other hand, you just go right to the front page your dashboard and you'll know immediately
[00:20:45.280 --> 00:20:51.120]   If you're a profit or loss, you'll know what bills are outstanding what your expenses are
[00:20:51.120 --> 00:20:57.280]   You'll know how you're doing you'll be able to track everything and it all starts with the invoice. That's how fresh books started
[00:20:57.280 --> 00:20:59.280]   That's how I started using them
[00:20:59.280 --> 00:21:02.640]   14 years ago when I was going to Toronto
[00:21:02.640 --> 00:21:10.240]   To do a call for help amber macarthur helped me because I really hated doing invoices by telling me about a brand new startup in Toronto called
[00:21:10.240 --> 00:21:12.480]   fresh books
[00:21:12.480 --> 00:21:17.840]   Now in the time since the decade since over 10 million small business owners use fresh books
[00:21:17.840 --> 00:21:22.320]   Because not only does it make it easy to make invoices 30 seconds to a great invoice
[00:21:22.320 --> 00:21:24.080]   Uh
[00:21:24.080 --> 00:21:31.760]   Does currency conversions you can import expenses time and hours right from the the app or keep track of hours in the
[00:21:31.760 --> 00:21:34.000]   web page on the web page as well they have a
[00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:39.920]   Time tracker there as well you can assign hours to specific projects or specific clients
[00:21:40.320 --> 00:21:43.920]   You could track your time to the minute and it all gets in the uh invoice
[00:21:43.920 --> 00:21:49.600]   And the invoice when you send it out looks pro looks, you know, it's got your logo. It really looks great and
[00:21:49.600 --> 00:21:51.920]   something unique
[00:21:51.920 --> 00:21:56.000]   It also has a pay me button on it and as a result
[00:21:56.000 --> 00:22:00.160]   Fresh books users get paid on an average of 11 days
[00:22:00.160 --> 00:22:03.200]   Faster than the other guys 11 days
[00:22:03.200 --> 00:22:05.120]   Faster
[00:22:05.120 --> 00:22:08.320]   Because your client turns out wants to pay you get this thing out of the way
[00:22:08.560 --> 00:22:10.560]   Just as much as you want to get invoicing out of the way
[00:22:10.560 --> 00:22:15.360]   You can always see what your invoices have been sent viewed paid you can see which ones are overdue
[00:22:15.360 --> 00:22:20.560]   Outstanding invoice totals by the way. Did you hear me say say you could see which ones have been viewed?
[00:22:20.560 --> 00:22:22.800]   That's kind of cool not cool. I wish I'd had that
[00:22:22.800 --> 00:22:27.360]   Because you know a lot of times somebody slow-pay will say well, I didn't get the invoice
[00:22:27.360 --> 00:22:30.880]   Senate and but this time you know you can say no, I saw you read it
[00:22:30.880 --> 00:22:32.960]   You viewed it
[00:22:32.960 --> 00:22:35.200]   you can manage team time sheets it's become
[00:22:36.160 --> 00:22:42.320]   Really an all inclusive system for the non-accountant but when it comes time to pay taxes
[00:22:42.320 --> 00:22:45.040]   That you'll also can get all those
[00:22:45.040 --> 00:22:50.640]   You know accountant like reports the reports your bookkeeper will what like total profit sales tax summary
[00:22:50.640 --> 00:22:55.760]   Profit and loss the balance sheet all of that. I love fresh books easy to use easy to start
[00:22:55.760 --> 00:23:01.040]   But it will organize you kind of painlessly and get you in great shape
[00:23:01.040 --> 00:23:02.880]   and
[00:23:02.880 --> 00:23:04.880]   You'll know whether you made any money

[00:23:56.800 --> 00:23:58.960]   so
[00:23:58.960 --> 00:24:02.480]   When when apple released this new macbook prose with a touch bar
[00:24:03.520 --> 00:24:05.840]   They said no more startup chime, right? Yes
[00:24:05.840 --> 00:24:11.680]   And then for a while you could do pseudo nv ram which is a
[00:24:11.680 --> 00:24:18.880]   Command on the command line a command line that lets you change the nonvolatile ram and turn on the chime
[00:24:18.880 --> 00:24:24.800]   Somebody told me that that has just that has was disabled in l cappitane. Is that true?
[00:24:24.800 --> 00:24:32.720]   That alte cappitane specifically well there was an update to l cappitane that disabled the the hack to turn on the
[00:24:33.680 --> 00:24:34.880]   chime
[00:24:34.880 --> 00:24:38.480]   I'm not running el cap on anything anymore. I'm not el cap whatever the car
[00:24:38.480 --> 00:24:43.360]   Yeah, okay. Yeah, I I don't know I'd have to try that because I neither
[00:24:43.360 --> 00:24:48.000]   I'm fine without the chime. Well, that's the thing. I don't notice and I didn't turn. Oh, shoot
[00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:50.080]   I should have done this. I thought you would know for sure
[00:24:50.080 --> 00:24:52.160]   I should have done this at home last night and I could have
[00:24:52.160 --> 00:24:55.920]   Answer my own question in the first month when it happens everyone's all upset about it
[00:24:55.920 --> 00:24:59.440]   So we covered intently and then like after a few months people are on to the next outbreak. Yeah, so we
[00:25:00.880 --> 00:25:05.200]   Nobody likes change right? No, and we hate boredom and we hate change just to continue
[00:25:05.200 --> 00:25:08.560]   It's the duality of our existence. So it's just in case you're interested
[00:25:08.560 --> 00:25:10.880]   You know what somebody get home try this
[00:25:10.880 --> 00:25:12.880]   pseudo
[00:25:12.880 --> 00:25:15.920]   Nv ram and then the next word is capital b
[00:25:15.920 --> 00:25:19.120]   capital a boot audio one word
[00:25:19.120 --> 00:25:22.800]   Equals and then you know you get the octal point
[00:25:22.800 --> 00:25:29.680]   percent o1 which means true and if you want to turn it back off again, it's percent zero zero which is false obviously
[00:25:30.400 --> 00:25:36.720]   But somebody called the radio show and said this no longer works. They updated they did an update
[00:25:36.720 --> 00:25:40.160]   You know what? I'm fine without the chime
[00:25:40.160 --> 00:25:44.800]   Yeah, although I mean if you want to go to the manual effort to putting it back on I feel like they should let you
[00:25:44.800 --> 00:25:47.040]   And I feel like they should yeah
[00:25:47.040 --> 00:25:49.680]   Yeah, like it usually was moved away because of the new way that it works
[00:25:49.680 --> 00:25:53.200]   They were worried that it would just go off right because they they automatically boot now
[00:25:53.200 --> 00:25:55.680]   It's not that you have to open it up and then press a button to boot it
[00:25:55.680 --> 00:26:00.000]   It will just boot whenever you open up and that's another thing you can change with the same
[00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:01.200]   command
[00:26:01.200 --> 00:26:04.960]   But in this case the parameter is auto boot capital a capital b equals
[00:26:04.960 --> 00:26:07.440]   zero zero or restore it with
[00:26:07.440 --> 00:26:10.880]   Percent zero three. I don't know. Maybe that's yeah
[00:26:10.880 --> 00:26:14.720]   So they're worried is that you'd open it up in a meeting and I go boom everyone would look at you all of a sudden
[00:26:14.720 --> 00:26:16.720]   I guess people sort of blamed out that right
[00:26:16.720 --> 00:26:19.520]   Oh people internally got awkward they had opened
[00:26:19.520 --> 00:26:22.880]   But it would be nice to be able to turn that on and turn it off
[00:26:22.880 --> 00:26:29.680]   One the one of the things that's kind of frustrating when you're trying to troubleshoot a problem is when you open up the machine and you don't know
[00:26:29.680 --> 00:26:35.520]   Are you act particularly because there's nothing mechanically spinning the fan isn't spinning even and you don't know okay?
[00:26:35.520 --> 00:26:38.240]   Have you have you are electronically speaking?
[00:26:38.240 --> 00:26:40.880]   Are you alive and you're just trying to figure out?
[00:26:40.880 --> 00:26:45.120]   How you could give yourself out of this hangover that you are in right now
[00:26:45.120 --> 00:26:48.080]   Or are you dead dead dead? Are you like the Norwegian blue?
[00:26:48.080 --> 00:26:50.720]   So it's if I can't I can't
[00:26:50.720 --> 00:26:57.600]   I can't say that it's impossible for someone to have a use for that feature and I would hate it if apple simply arbitrarily decided
[00:26:57.680 --> 00:27:02.640]   We're just gonna lock it out forever for everybody. That'd be weird, right? Yeah, particularly particularly that pseudo command
[00:27:02.640 --> 00:27:05.440]   It's like I love these I love these commands that are
[00:27:05.440 --> 00:27:12.960]   I love functions that are there for someone who wants to look for it because someone who's going to look for that command and then open a terminal shell
[00:27:12.960 --> 00:27:15.040]   And then type this in character by character
[00:27:15.040 --> 00:27:21.440]   Is someone who really really really wants that chime and so that that that man or woman should have their chime back damn it
[00:27:21.440 --> 00:27:23.760]   Uh, but to say that
[00:27:23.760 --> 00:27:29.040]   To say that under no circumstances could anybody have a cheery sound greet you when you when your machine wakes up
[00:27:29.040 --> 00:27:33.920]   Yeah, I hope there's a reason it's not arbitrary. Well, thanks. Wally sad the other reason
[00:27:33.920 --> 00:27:36.880]   I like it when apple leaves stuff like this in
[00:27:36.880 --> 00:27:41.680]   Is then a um motivated smart kid is gonna go. Oh
[00:27:41.680 --> 00:27:44.320]   Wonder what else envy ram does
[00:27:44.320 --> 00:27:48.080]   Yeah, wonder what else that command does and this is an entry
[00:27:48.080 --> 00:27:52.480]   This is a gateway into learning. This is for all of us older folks who had to do this
[00:27:52.880 --> 00:27:56.000]   This is a gateway into the guts of the computer and I like that
[00:27:56.000 --> 00:28:01.600]   It also means that if you know if Craig didn't turn it off for eddy and he opens his machine at the exact meeting and the chime goes off
[00:28:01.600 --> 00:28:06.400]   And tim cook just turns those dark side eyes on him. He can very quickly go and change the setting turn it back off again
[00:28:06.400 --> 00:28:10.560]   I mean everybody's learning experience. Tim cook doesn't have dark side eyes. Come on
[00:28:10.560 --> 00:28:16.320]   You can actually screw things up with this envy ram command and it's conceivable
[00:28:16.320 --> 00:28:19.600]   that apple may be
[00:28:20.800 --> 00:28:28.240]   Changed what envy ram could do or made it more complicated because you could you can this this model modifies the firmware
[00:28:28.240 --> 00:28:33.360]   Uh, so, you know, you could maybe someone exploited it. You could yeah, who knows?
[00:28:33.360 --> 00:28:40.400]   Who knows? I mean it looked it's this is the man page it manipulate firmware envy ram variables
[00:28:40.400 --> 00:28:43.200]   So but you can delete variables
[00:28:43.200 --> 00:28:47.520]   Hey kids want free access to this adult site all you have to do is type this into terminal
[00:28:47.600 --> 00:28:51.200]   Yeah, it could you know really could be you can also put in boot arguments
[00:28:51.200 --> 00:28:57.280]   Which is interesting so you could force for instance the computer to always boot into single user mode or
[00:28:57.280 --> 00:29:02.320]   Um, so it's very powerful command dates back to 2003
[00:29:02.320 --> 00:29:05.120]   Right into this man page
[00:29:05.120 --> 00:29:11.280]   Um is I guess envy ram is the old p ram right the parameter ram. It's the new name non-vulnerable
[00:29:11.280 --> 00:29:16.160]   All right. Well, and he wants to try this at home. Go ahead
[00:29:16.160 --> 00:29:18.160]   Let us know
[00:29:18.160 --> 00:29:25.520]   It's fine mom. Let us remember anything anything you type after pseudo should be checked double checked and triple checked
[00:29:25.520 --> 00:29:33.120]   Sudio is the is the unix command and in this case, it's uh, you know the Darwin command
[00:29:33.120 --> 00:29:36.000]   Uh that gives you a root user privileges
[00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:39.280]   You'll be asked for your password and you'll have to have an administrator password to do this
[00:29:39.280 --> 00:29:42.560]   And if you do then well all bets are off you can
[00:29:43.600 --> 00:29:47.520]   There's nothing you can't do including erase the entire drive with a simple command
[00:29:47.520 --> 00:29:51.280]   Um, I think if you zap the envy ram
[00:29:51.280 --> 00:29:54.640]   You can still do command option pr. It will reset it
[00:29:54.640 --> 00:30:00.960]   So if you do something and screw up in v ram, I think it can be reset that reset the pram reset the pram
[00:30:00.960 --> 00:30:04.000]   Right reset the pram remember that remember those old days
[00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:10.880]   That was that was beautifully as so as as the text as a tech support person in the family or in an office
[00:30:11.200 --> 00:30:16.720]   If you just say zap the pram and restart that gives you a good eight to ten minutes to then go and look for the actual
[00:30:16.720 --> 00:30:23.920]   Yeah, get back to me
[00:30:23.920 --> 00:30:28.240]   Uh some of oh hate I hate these stories malware mac malware
[00:30:28.240 --> 00:30:31.280]   Uh, and this is pinned on the same group apparently
[00:30:31.280 --> 00:30:34.080]   That hacked the election
[00:30:34.080 --> 00:30:36.880]   I'm just saying that I don't know
[00:30:36.880 --> 00:30:38.880]   Uh, this is a garage band
[00:30:39.360 --> 00:30:43.760]   Malware, I noticed there was an update to logic today. Maybe this is related
[00:30:43.760 --> 00:30:46.560]   Um, it's a vulnerability
[00:30:46.560 --> 00:30:54.400]   In the music creation software that could be exploited by an out attacker using and this is the thing that's depressing malform project files
[00:30:54.400 --> 00:30:59.680]   So you could go to a website and say oh, well, you know, it's just a garage band project that couldn't possibly hurt me
[00:30:59.680 --> 00:31:02.640]   But we've seen data files hurt people before yep
[00:31:02.640 --> 00:31:06.640]   If the program that executes the data file has a vulnerability
[00:31:07.200 --> 00:31:09.440]   Remember there were trying to be faster than we just execute data
[00:31:09.440 --> 00:31:14.400]   Immediately so that it seems snappy. I mean that was the whole flash and uh, no problem
[00:31:14.400 --> 00:31:19.200]   Uh, yeah, it's a dot band file. So it's it's gonna happen
[00:31:19.200 --> 00:31:24.160]   I mean as these as apple gets a higher profile and even max get a higher profile and the targets because
[00:31:24.160 --> 00:31:27.760]   Security is a lot of it is about economics and when it becomes
[00:31:27.760 --> 00:31:33.680]   Uh, sufficiently economical to attack me both max they'll do it if there's a huge cost and almost no profile
[00:31:33.920 --> 00:31:39.920]   It makes no sense to attack max but if there's if there's something you can get out of it and especially things like ransomware now are cheap to implement and
[00:31:39.920 --> 00:31:41.120]   lucrative for them
[00:31:41.120 --> 00:31:44.560]   They'll go after it so it goes back to like not to sound too much like steve gibson
[00:31:44.560 --> 00:31:47.120]   But how fast companies respond to this stuff that matters. Yeah
[00:31:47.120 --> 00:31:49.840]   um
[00:31:49.840 --> 00:31:52.640]   And it could have something to do with the fact that I mean
[00:31:52.640 --> 00:31:56.560]   A little praise to microsoft here. They've made windows much more secure
[00:31:56.560 --> 00:32:01.360]   Uh, and so the attacks don't generally go after windows anymore or even os 10 anymore
[00:32:01.360 --> 00:32:03.600]   They go or macro as they go after apps
[00:32:03.600 --> 00:32:10.160]   That can be yeah web and now apps. Yeah, by the way, I I misread this. Uh, I was linked to the wrong article
[00:32:10.160 --> 00:32:12.800]   This is this x agent is the mac malware
[00:32:12.800 --> 00:32:18.720]   It steals passwords grab screenshots and exfiltrates iphone backups and it is this is the one that
[00:32:18.720 --> 00:32:21.520]   supposedly
[00:32:21.520 --> 00:32:24.560]   Uh is from the same russian group fancy bear
[00:32:24.560 --> 00:32:29.600]   That uh hacked the uh election
[00:32:30.240 --> 00:32:34.960]   You know, one of the ways that russian groups got didn't hack the election got into the dnc
[00:32:34.960 --> 00:32:40.320]   The one of the ways russian groups got into the dnc is by with is having specially coated malware
[00:32:40.320 --> 00:32:42.560]   And then spearfishing it's your fishing
[00:32:42.560 --> 00:32:45.760]   So it would make sense especially if it's a government
[00:32:45.760 --> 00:32:51.280]   That they would work on the similar exploits that work on max as well as on windows pcs
[00:32:51.280 --> 00:32:54.400]   The mac version of x agent is a modular back door
[00:32:54.400 --> 00:32:57.760]   I used to have one of those, but I got it fixed
[00:32:57.760 --> 00:32:59.440]   That can be because
[00:32:59.440 --> 00:33:03.360]   They can be customized to meet the objectives of a given intrusion
[00:33:03.360 --> 00:33:09.840]   Uh including logging passwords snapping pictures of screen displays stealing iOS backups
[00:33:09.840 --> 00:33:13.040]   Uh on the ca stored on the compromised mac
[00:33:13.040 --> 00:33:15.360]   I had a fascinating discussion last week
[00:33:15.360 --> 00:33:18.880]   We were talking about whether you should encrypt backups or not and I spoke to people who make backup software
[00:33:18.880 --> 00:33:22.640]   They say never do it because the data theft is not a big problem
[00:33:22.640 --> 00:33:28.800]   But data recovery is a huge problem and if you encrypt everything you can't recover your family photos your baby pictures your tax documents
[00:33:29.120 --> 00:33:34.240]   All that stuff and then I spoke to the info sec guys they're like no no forget that encrypt everything very in your backyard
[00:33:34.240 --> 00:33:36.960]   Stand water buffalo on top of it salt the earth
[00:33:36.960 --> 00:33:41.520]   Um, I mean you you were getting to this whole discussion about whether you want to fail safe or fail secure
[00:33:41.520 --> 00:33:44.960]   And there's no good both of them have valid points and there's no easy answer anymore
[00:33:44.960 --> 00:33:48.080]   Bit defended with which is the security company that discovered this
[00:33:48.080 --> 00:33:56.880]   Uh calls this russian hacking group apt 28, but they've go under a variety of names clean fancy bear pawn storms said net so fasty
[00:33:57.680 --> 00:34:00.400]   Um, they've been operating according to a crowd strike
[00:34:00.400 --> 00:34:06.080]   Since 2007 they believe are closely tied to the the russian government
[00:34:06.080 --> 00:34:11.680]   Certainly russian they speak russian. They work during russian business hours
[00:34:11.680 --> 00:34:17.280]   And and you know what if they're really hackers work in business hours. They must be working for a government
[00:34:17.280 --> 00:34:20.720]   uh, anyway a lot of lot of uh
[00:34:20.720 --> 00:34:27.440]   You know research on this x-agent actually is available for windows and linux as well as mac o s
[00:34:28.080 --> 00:34:31.440]   They do the government work during the day and they do the free last off. Yeah, yeah
[00:34:31.440 --> 00:34:37.360]   Art's make a page like these. How do you get x-agent? You know, watch out for uh attachments, you know, this
[00:34:37.360 --> 00:34:42.960]   Spear fishing is is generally the way these kinds of groups get in there because they
[00:34:42.960 --> 00:34:45.920]   You know, there's two kinds of bad guys
[00:34:45.920 --> 00:34:51.760]   There's the ones are trying to you know doing uh ransomware and stuff trying to make money and they just send it to everybody
[00:34:52.400 --> 00:34:59.360]   And then they're the ones who are particularly targeting targeting the dnc or sony or uh, you know
[00:34:59.360 --> 00:35:04.800]   Sans back end casino operation. They want to get in somewhere specific
[00:35:04.800 --> 00:35:11.360]   Uh, and and those are the those are the ones that are offering are government governmental because uh, they're trying to use
[00:35:11.360 --> 00:35:13.840]   You know, it's basically a form of espionage
[00:35:13.840 --> 00:35:20.800]   You're we're not likely to get hit by these kinds of things unless we work for the fbi or you know, somebody like that because
[00:35:20.800 --> 00:35:24.480]   When I used to work in enterprise it happened back then someone would get an email and they were using it
[00:35:24.480 --> 00:35:27.200]   They would infect it. They would get used and addressed from their email to send somebody else
[00:35:27.200 --> 00:35:31.920]   They thought they were getting the email from someone they trusted and it would have something titillating like, oh, did you see these pictures?
[00:35:31.920 --> 00:35:39.440]   And they would click on it and then they didn't network. Yep. Yeah, or just simply enough you put you spend a small amount of money on some really expensive
[00:35:39.440 --> 00:35:45.360]   uh, sand disc 128 gigabyte or 256 gigabyte flash drives and you just hey looks of some loser
[00:35:45.760 --> 00:35:50.320]   Dropped a drop to flash drive outside in the street boy. I i'm not going to look for the owner of this
[00:35:50.320 --> 00:35:54.400]   I'm just going to take it and then i'm going to put it inside my computer and erase it and then yeah
[00:35:54.400 --> 00:35:57.920]   That's how that's how they get in. That's why that's why a lot of computers both
[00:35:57.920 --> 00:36:00.400]   Both the corporate and uh government levels
[00:36:00.400 --> 00:36:05.040]   They will actually but they will actually fill the usb ports with epoxy
[00:36:05.040 --> 00:36:08.720]   Because you are not allowed to attach anything to these devices
[00:36:08.720 --> 00:36:12.240]   And we know that if we give you the possibility of doing so you will try to do it
[00:36:12.240 --> 00:36:14.960]   And that's why we had to cement those three ports over
[00:36:15.360 --> 00:36:18.560]   And barely stop people from tweeting their passwords. I mean we got a lot of problems these days
[00:36:18.560 --> 00:36:24.960]   Why why why does apple hate right to repair? That's the question. They've been lobbying strongly against
[00:36:24.960 --> 00:36:29.280]   The eight states that are trying to pass right to repair legislation
[00:36:29.280 --> 00:36:32.160]   I don't think they hate it. I think they don't want this
[00:36:32.160 --> 00:36:36.400]   They're the way that they are seeing the future of their designs. I think is that
[00:36:36.400 --> 00:36:39.840]   It goes in a different direction from making them repairable
[00:36:39.840 --> 00:36:41.520]   And it's not that they're against repairability
[00:36:41.520 --> 00:36:44.720]   It's just they feel like they can pack far more technology into a far smaller later
[00:36:44.720 --> 00:36:49.200]   Design if they don't have to worry about repairability. Yeah, and they have to
[00:36:49.200 --> 00:36:56.960]   Go ahead. I'm sorry. There's also the security issue when we had that error 53 remember because if you brought your iphone to a third party repair
[00:36:56.960 --> 00:37:03.440]   Person uh and there then was an update to ios that they've ricked it because apple. Yeah, that was a
[00:37:03.440 --> 00:37:08.240]   It was an error on apples part, but the but the reason for the error was
[00:37:09.360 --> 00:37:13.280]   They couldn't be sure this secure store was you know the integrity of the secure
[00:37:13.280 --> 00:37:18.640]   People to be able to swap secure enclaves or touch ID sensors as a way to get around touch ID exactly
[00:37:18.640 --> 00:37:22.160]   Yeah, so I think apple can make that argument that well
[00:37:22.160 --> 00:37:27.200]   We've built a totally secure platform and one of the risks of having third party repair shops
[00:37:27.200 --> 00:37:32.960]   Replace your screen is it's tightly integrated to the touch ID and you're not going to have a secure platform anymore
[00:37:32.960 --> 00:37:37.840]   Yeah, but this this is a really really big issue and I hope apple loses this one hard
[00:37:38.160 --> 00:37:41.760]   Because the the the origin of this of these bills are
[00:37:41.760 --> 00:37:49.840]   Companies like john dere who have been selling farmer selling people farm equipment with proprietary connectors and proprietary
[00:37:49.840 --> 00:37:55.440]   and and software and fittings and and and things that with the idea that you
[00:37:55.440 --> 00:38:00.800]   Instead of being able to fix your own things you have to now get a service contract
[00:38:00.800 --> 00:38:05.520]   You have to buy genuine parts just like there was a time when you could simply refill a printer in cartridge
[00:38:05.760 --> 00:38:09.680]   But then companies like hp and epsin decide what if we put a chip in that says that no, no
[00:38:09.680 --> 00:38:11.680]   No, you you must buy a brand new one
[00:38:11.680 --> 00:38:13.840]   Uh, there is it comes down to ownership
[00:38:13.840 --> 00:38:19.120]   Do they does a company have a right to say that you can only but we are going to be the exclusive source of parts
[00:38:19.120 --> 00:38:22.240]   The exclusive source of service for this machine
[00:38:22.240 --> 00:38:26.320]   And if so, what is the how long does it take for those companies to decide?
[00:38:26.320 --> 00:38:32.480]   Okay, so now we're just going to make sure that we bulldozer all the spare parts that we've got stockpiled after two and a half years
[00:38:32.640 --> 00:38:34.640]   To make sure that people don't
[00:38:34.640 --> 00:38:40.160]   Don't still keep using a phone that otherwise could keep going for two three four five six seven years
[00:38:40.160 --> 00:38:42.160]   I mean there are cars there are cars that have
[00:38:42.160 --> 00:38:48.400]   I'm not talking about like historic cars. I'm talking about cars that were had a brand new owner and then someone bought it
[00:38:48.400 --> 00:38:51.760]   Used after three or four years. They drove over for 10 years
[00:38:51.760 --> 00:38:57.520]   And then they handed it off to their son going to college and then it spent its last 2 000 miles
[00:38:57.520 --> 00:39:01.440]   In the hands of a cousin who desperately needed a car while they were shopping for their own new car
[00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:07.840]   And you know, you got 13 14 15 16 years on the road because they could get parts for this thing
[00:39:07.840 --> 00:39:12.640]   So it's it's it's it's it's convenience thing. It's a it's an ownership thing
[00:39:12.640 --> 00:39:17.680]   And for industries like again like farming it is a survival thing
[00:39:17.680 --> 00:39:18.560]   You can't
[00:39:18.560 --> 00:39:21.840]   Someone who is someone who could fix anything with bailing wire and a pair of pliers
[00:39:21.840 --> 00:39:24.960]   And tell them that no, you have to have you have to make a service call
[00:39:24.960 --> 00:39:30.160]   You have to have this guy come out with a with a box with a special computer in it just to say that yep
[00:39:30.400 --> 00:39:36.320]   We need to adjust this intake a little bit great. It's been adjusted. There'll be $8,000. Please. That's no good
[00:39:36.320 --> 00:39:42.880]   So that's why I hope apple loses this one hard. We need some sort of a right to repair interesting article and motherboard
[00:39:42.880 --> 00:39:46.640]   There are eight states considering these bills right now in Nebraska, Minnesota
[00:39:46.640 --> 00:39:52.240]   New York, Massachusetts, Kansas, Wyoming and last week, Illinois and Tennessee
[00:39:52.240 --> 00:39:59.280]   Joined that group but this story from motherboard, which I think is very interesting and let's give credit to uh, the author
[00:39:59.760 --> 00:40:01.760]   Jason cobbler
[00:40:01.760 --> 00:40:05.840]   Says that uh in Nebraska state, uh, legislature
[00:40:05.840 --> 00:40:12.640]   Called them to tell them about some of the tactics apple is using
[00:40:12.640 --> 00:40:16.560]   Uh, she said she's interesting because she is a programmer
[00:40:16.560 --> 00:40:22.000]   And and has uh, you know, she's in this Nebraska state legislature, but she's also
[00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:28.080]   A very technical person and an apple lobbyist came to her and said look, you know, uh, you know, uh,
[00:40:28.080 --> 00:40:32.320]   Try to pull the wool over her eyes basically and she she said, you know, I'm more technical than you think
[00:40:32.320 --> 00:40:36.320]   Uh, then then he said an interesting thing the apple lobbyist said well, look
[00:40:36.320 --> 00:40:41.280]   Just change the bill as long as you don't talk as long as it doesn't cover phones. We don't care
[00:40:41.280 --> 00:40:49.440]   We we we you know in other words, you can cover you can say right to repair john dear just not right to repair iPhones
[00:40:49.440 --> 00:40:52.160]   um
[00:40:52.160 --> 00:40:53.360]   So
[00:40:53.360 --> 00:40:56.240]   That's an interesting uh angle on that
[00:40:56.960 --> 00:41:00.880]   Uh, come march 9th when there'll be a hearing about this in lincoln
[00:41:00.880 --> 00:41:06.400]   An apple representative will testify against the bill according to uh cobbler's article
[00:41:06.400 --> 00:41:09.280]   and um
[00:41:09.280 --> 00:41:14.560]   The source told me that at least one of the companies plans to say the consumers who repair their own phones could cause
[00:41:14.560 --> 00:41:17.120]   lithium ion batteries to catch fire
[00:41:17.120 --> 00:41:20.640]   Okay
[00:41:20.640 --> 00:41:23.920]   18 t said we're not gonna we're not gonna attend or testify
[00:41:25.360 --> 00:41:29.600]   And uh, so you know, it's I I understand both sides of it
[00:41:29.600 --> 00:41:34.400]   There's got to be a way in the case of error 53 apple found a nice
[00:41:34.400 --> 00:41:40.560]   Middle road, which was as soon as you had third party repairs on that thing. They just said well, okay now
[00:41:40.560 --> 00:41:43.520]   You know it didn't break the phone. They just said now it's not secure
[00:41:43.520 --> 00:41:48.640]   So what did they turn off apple pay? Yeah apple pay anything they're acquired authentication along it worked
[00:41:48.640 --> 00:41:50.480]   I think that's not
[00:41:50.480 --> 00:41:52.480]   That's a good compromise
[00:41:52.960 --> 00:41:57.680]   It's but there's just so many ways around such things again. I just hope that people have the right to
[00:41:57.680 --> 00:42:04.720]   Find their own solutions. It still burns me that um, I have still in my office. I have a macbook pro that was
[00:42:04.720 --> 00:42:12.400]   A three years ago that had a bad trackpad that would have cost me a close to a thousand dollars
[00:42:12.400 --> 00:42:16.800]   Just to fix that bad trackpad because oh well the track because the manufacturing process
[00:42:16.800 --> 00:42:21.360]   The trackpad is part of that lower case and the keyboard is also part of that lower case
[00:42:21.360 --> 00:42:23.920]   And we don't sell that those assemblies separately
[00:42:23.920 --> 00:42:30.880]   So you're basically going to have to buy 52 percent of a brand new macbook in order to just be able to click things again
[00:42:30.880 --> 00:42:33.680]   Uh, and it's like, okay. Well, like I
[00:42:33.680 --> 00:42:38.000]   Yeah, that's one day to replace the whole side of the car
[00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:41.440]   Yeah, that doesn't that doesn't make you a happy consumer didn't make me one
[00:42:41.440 --> 00:42:45.520]   And I bought but fortunately I could replace it with something with a halfway decent keyboard
[00:42:45.520 --> 00:42:49.600]   So I didn't think that much about it. Yeah, and also there's a difference between a computer and a phone
[00:42:49.760 --> 00:42:54.880]   So I would hope apple would support the right to repair computers. I have a similar experience with a laptop many years ago
[00:42:54.880 --> 00:42:58.160]   My good friend tom santos who ran a great apple
[00:42:58.160 --> 00:43:00.240]   uh
[00:43:00.240 --> 00:43:07.680]   VAR store they were authorized apple reseller in uh san francisco the great mac adam eventually he had to go out of business because apple
[00:43:07.680 --> 00:43:09.440]   Basically did not give him
[00:43:09.440 --> 00:43:13.040]   Any parts any any supplies of equipment or gear to sell
[00:43:13.040 --> 00:43:17.840]   Uh, they just favored their own stores, but for a long time mac adam was the place I would go I had broken
[00:43:18.320 --> 00:43:22.080]   I had you know before magsafe had broken off the power connector
[00:43:22.080 --> 00:43:27.040]   I brought it to apple. They said a thousand dollars to swap the logic board. I brought it in a macad
[00:43:27.040 --> 00:43:31.120]   I mean said yeah, I'll be I'll be right back and soldered it back on for 50 bucks
[00:43:31.120 --> 00:43:34.720]   That's a big difference and that's where right to repair can make a huge
[00:43:34.720 --> 00:43:39.760]   It's different. It's without any compromising security, but I think on laptops is a little different than phones
[00:43:39.760 --> 00:43:41.520]   Yeah, the interesting I mean again
[00:43:41.520 --> 00:43:46.080]   I'm of two minds of this as well because on one hand i'd absolutely like to be able to fix my macbook pro
[00:43:46.160 --> 00:43:48.960]   I hand them down to family members and I'd like them to go as much as possible
[00:43:48.960 --> 00:43:50.560]   And I want them to be cheap to repair
[00:43:50.560 --> 00:43:55.680]   But you know when you look at the new macbook pro and the way they achieve a lot of the rigidity in the unibody structures
[00:43:55.680 --> 00:44:00.720]   Is by making these one single unit things that don't bend or move or have multiple parts that get you know
[00:44:00.720 --> 00:44:03.840]   They get screwed together. So they are literally one block
[00:44:03.840 --> 00:44:08.480]   And that is how not just it's not a coincidence that they like that or happenstance
[00:44:08.480 --> 00:44:12.240]   It's a deliberate design decision to make really strong really light computers
[00:44:12.480 --> 00:44:17.600]   And that would have to reverse in some ways to make and also be a del approach where oh the daughter bar is bad
[00:44:17.600 --> 00:44:20.800]   But the mother bar is still fine. But the new daughter board on that'll be great go out the door
[00:44:20.800 --> 00:44:26.000]   And it's it's very different than the way apple traditionally is approached where they want the features of computers to go
[00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:29.680]   Not for a parability issues, but just for how they want to structurally engineer these things
[00:44:29.680 --> 00:44:33.360]   The the state senator by the way, I want to give her credit
[00:44:33.360 --> 00:44:37.840]   She's an Nebraska state senator litia brash and unlike a lot of sources. She
[00:44:37.840 --> 00:44:40.960]   went public she called
[00:44:41.360 --> 00:44:48.640]   Motherboard and said she had been visited by steve kester who is an apple state government affairs specialist a lobbyist
[00:44:48.640 --> 00:44:50.480]   and
[00:44:50.480 --> 00:44:56.400]   brash said apple said we would be the only state that would pass this and we've become a mecca for hackers bad actors
[00:44:56.400 --> 00:45:02.080]   They said doing this would make it very easy for hacker hackers to relocate to nebraska come on
[00:45:02.080 --> 00:45:04.720]   They didn't realize that brash
[00:45:04.720 --> 00:45:10.400]   Besides being a farmer also works remotely for a software company at lana has a background in computer science
[00:45:11.200 --> 00:45:17.360]   She she said he really wasn't prepared for me to defend my bill. It's her bill
[00:45:17.360 --> 00:45:23.680]   I think they were surprised to learn i've worked in the technology field for the last 15 years even though i'm a farmer
[00:45:23.680 --> 00:45:31.120]   Kester also was the one who suggested that if they just take the phone part out of the bill
[00:45:31.120 --> 00:45:37.840]   Apple would go away brash said that's tempting but we need to repair consumer technology to the story they're telling
[00:45:38.240 --> 00:45:41.920]   Is that we need to be afraid of technology? You don't have to be afraid of technology
[00:45:41.920 --> 00:45:46.080]   You have to be afraid of the people who are trying to prevent you from knowing the things they know
[00:45:46.080 --> 00:45:49.760]   Are these coming? It's all fear. It's just laziness sometimes. Yeah
[00:45:49.760 --> 00:45:56.400]   Well, I mean it's I I just in principle think that if you own if you own a device you should own whatever you want
[00:45:56.400 --> 00:46:00.000]   And I don't like the idea of an artificial entity saying that well
[00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:02.960]   It's not in our best interest if you hold on to your phone for four or five years
[00:46:02.960 --> 00:46:05.280]   So we're gonna make it really really hard for you to do that. Yeah
[00:46:05.840 --> 00:46:10.720]   I still remember that moment my father used to build his own cars take my part from scratch rebuild everything
[00:46:10.720 --> 00:46:16.480]   Yeah, he opened I remember I forgot how old it was but I wasn't that old and he just opened a new car that he got and he just closed
[00:46:16.480 --> 00:46:18.480]   It shook his head walked away and never worked
[00:46:18.480 --> 00:46:28.960]   I mean you need a big computer, you know the and the and you know for a while the car companies would sell him to you
[00:46:28.960 --> 00:46:34.560]   Along with all the repair manuals as so if you had enough money you could start an independent prepare shop
[00:46:34.560 --> 00:46:38.160]   But he rebuilt alpha Romeo's and now he's looking at a Tesla and I don't know
[00:46:38.160 --> 00:46:41.040]   I'm pretty sure those are as locked down as you can get
[00:46:41.040 --> 00:46:45.680]   Because in john d'ere too because they say they're proprietary software in here. We don't want
[00:46:45.680 --> 00:46:49.120]   Hey, we don't want somebody to steal it be we don't somebody want somebody to hack it
[00:46:49.120 --> 00:46:52.720]   Well, but also remember that's the bs that john d'ere was throwing around
[00:46:52.720 --> 00:46:58.480]   They were saying that their their proprietary software and proprietary connectors were protected by the digital millennium copyright act
[00:46:58.480 --> 00:47:02.800]   And any attempt to circumvent the ip protection that they had put on it digitally
[00:47:03.120 --> 00:47:09.360]   Was a was as good as trying to create 10 000 bootleg blue rays of melana
[00:47:09.360 --> 00:47:13.120]   And it's like there's no equivalency there. We we know you're talking bull
[00:47:13.120 --> 00:47:17.600]   Just we know that you're desperate to say that we are trying to skin some our customers
[00:47:17.600 --> 00:47:23.840]   Out of every penny we can ring out of them and we're just going to we're hoping that the people we're paying to sling this bull
[00:47:23.840 --> 00:47:27.200]   Our feel like they're being paid enough to not like have to
[00:47:28.240 --> 00:47:32.400]   Sigh with every statement that we're telling them just to make in public. It's terrible
[00:47:32.400 --> 00:47:38.160]   If you're in one of the eight states lobby your member of the state legislature you're aldermen you're
[00:47:38.160 --> 00:47:42.640]   Burgess whatever they they call it. We talked to kyle weans of iFixit of course
[00:47:42.640 --> 00:47:47.680]   He's very interested in the right to repair because iFixit sells parts and manuals
[00:47:47.680 --> 00:47:52.080]   And they would love it if apple would release their official manuals
[00:47:52.080 --> 00:47:57.520]   So that iFixit wouldn't have to guess and all this stuff and make it up and do all the research they do and they do a great job
[00:47:57.840 --> 00:48:01.360]   You would also love it if they'd have access to official parts
[00:48:01.360 --> 00:48:05.120]   That would make everybody happy and that's one way apple could solve this, you know
[00:48:05.120 --> 00:48:11.120]   Uh, you know train third parties and how to do this and maintain the secure enclave things like that
[00:48:11.120 --> 00:48:16.800]   Wean says if one state any one of the eight states passes it that's good enough because
[00:48:16.800 --> 00:48:20.480]   Of course then that state will require all this stuff be released
[00:48:20.480 --> 00:48:23.600]   And uh, that'll just open it up for everybody
[00:48:23.600 --> 00:48:27.040]   He said the easiest he thought would get to get this through would be massachusetts
[00:48:27.040 --> 00:48:29.440]   So if you're lucky enough to live in massachusetts
[00:48:29.440 --> 00:48:35.760]   Uh, right you're a member of what do they call him? Andy Burgess's there's some funny name for him. I don't know
[00:48:35.760 --> 00:48:41.840]   Uh, we've basically called them. Why these why these people why these people the bulgars
[00:48:41.840 --> 00:48:46.560]   No, not but imagine though like iphone eight ships with a brand new OLED display and they're like where is the replacement parts?
[00:48:46.560 --> 00:48:49.760]   Where's the official place where we can't even make enough to ship the phone? Where's the replacement part?
[00:48:49.760 --> 00:48:52.240]   I mean, it's it's gonna be it's gonna be interesting right
[00:48:53.120 --> 00:48:58.320]   Right it feels to me like there's a huge overlap between this and the ongoing criticism of the pro market where you look at apples
[00:48:58.320 --> 00:49:01.600]   Numbers and less and less of their customers are pros and more and more the mainstream
[00:49:01.600 --> 00:49:07.280]   Who have absolutely no zero interest in any of this stuff and they want to move more fully into that market
[00:49:07.280 --> 00:49:09.680]   But at the same time they have this traditional computer mindset
[00:49:09.680 --> 00:49:14.640]   Original gadget mindset of people who were not afraid to take apart ham radios or to build their computer from a DOS box
[00:49:14.640 --> 00:49:21.200]   Or to use terminal and things like that and they're those markets are increasingly it feels like there's an increasing tension between those two customer bases
[00:49:21.200 --> 00:49:23.040]   Yeah
[00:49:23.040 --> 00:49:25.040]   um
[00:49:25.040 --> 00:49:31.200]   So who was it tweeted there's a there's pressure speaking of the pros, uh, oh it was marco. I think
[00:49:31.200 --> 00:49:33.840]   Marco arman who tweeted
[00:49:33.840 --> 00:49:35.440]   um
[00:49:35.440 --> 00:49:40.160]   1000 what was it 500 some days since the mac pro was an s ww
[00:49:40.160 --> 00:49:44.000]   Yeah, 1,532 days since it's been updated
[00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:49.760]   The ink isn't even red on the how long has it been delayed list? It's just like a deep wine color now. It's aging
[00:49:49.840 --> 00:49:52.000]   Yeah, oh it was uh marquez brownly
[00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:57.440]   He says days since phil shiller said can't innovate anymore my ass and revealed a new mac pro
[00:49:57.440 --> 00:49:59.600]   1,351
[00:49:59.600 --> 00:50:05.600]   Days since the last mac pro update 1,351 that's not strictly true because it was announced long before it was shipped
[00:50:05.600 --> 00:50:12.160]   Nevertheless, uh an apt quote. I think yeah, maybe we're just interpreting the punctuation of that statement
[00:50:12.160 --> 00:50:17.360]   Maybe if we change that to a certain ellipsis or semicolon. It would it would actually be truthful
[00:50:19.200 --> 00:50:21.200]   It was just saying
[00:50:21.200 --> 00:50:23.200]   My ass can't innovate
[00:50:23.200 --> 00:50:25.760]   comma my ass
[00:50:25.760 --> 00:50:27.760]   It's my ass
[00:50:27.760 --> 00:50:30.560]   Maybe he left out the it's
[00:50:30.560 --> 00:50:37.200]   I mean, hopefully i said i said i i i stormed into the office
[00:50:37.200 --> 00:50:40.080]   And i was yelling at my guys because i was just i said it's you guys
[00:50:40.080 --> 00:50:43.680]   When you guys are going to get around to making a new mac pro
[00:50:44.080 --> 00:50:51.680]   And then cook wise guys come back to me with a round mac pro and look at me here having to shovel this in front of you people
[00:50:51.680 --> 00:50:54.240]   I'm sorry. I'm seeing
[00:50:54.240 --> 00:50:57.040]   Well
[00:50:57.040 --> 00:50:59.920]   Not that I would I maybe I would buy a mac pro if they released it
[00:50:59.920 --> 00:51:06.800]   I don't know. I'm i'm happy with his surface studio. I have l i have more and more computers with linux on it
[00:51:06.800 --> 00:51:10.800]   Almost all my time is spent on linux
[00:51:10.800 --> 00:51:13.520]   Can you run the surface pro as a display for the mac pro?
[00:51:13.520 --> 00:51:19.440]   I wish you could but I think it's the same problem that the iMac has which is there's so much hardware in here
[00:51:19.440 --> 00:51:25.440]   People asked uh, microsoft please release the surface studio as a not as a computer
[00:51:25.440 --> 00:51:26.880]   But as a monitor
[00:51:26.880 --> 00:51:30.320]   And they said we're not we can't we're not and it's I think it's the same thing
[00:51:30.320 --> 00:51:34.080]   There's there's an arm chip just like there is on the iMac. There's an arm chip behind this
[00:51:34.080 --> 00:51:39.040]   Screen it's doing a lot of the work. I think I wonder if apple will ever get so
[00:51:39.600 --> 00:51:41.040]   um
[00:51:41.040 --> 00:51:49.280]   The apples relationship to the mac line will ever get so fluid that they would actually allow you to go to the i-tune store
[00:51:49.280 --> 00:51:54.720]   Rather go to the app store and purchase a virtualization license for let's say 50 or 60 dollars
[00:51:54.720 --> 00:52:02.000]   So that you could run it on one or two approved virtualization virtualization apps like uh like open box
[00:52:02.000 --> 00:52:04.480]   Uh, i'm sorry like virtual box
[00:52:04.480 --> 00:52:10.640]   And so you could then go ahead and pick your own laptop or pick your own tower and at least run it in some fashion on those devices
[00:52:10.640 --> 00:52:13.360]   Well, that would be interesting
[00:52:13.360 --> 00:52:16.960]   It's there they see they do seem to be like losing their interest in
[00:52:16.960 --> 00:52:20.400]   in a lot of what uh, they used to
[00:52:20.400 --> 00:52:23.040]   They they they they seem to have lost their interest in
[00:52:23.040 --> 00:52:26.480]   creating a real fluid
[00:52:26.480 --> 00:52:32.160]   Uh dynamic line of mac hardware. They seem to only want to make these
[00:52:32.960 --> 00:52:36.480]   machines that they think they're really good at making or really interested in making
[00:52:36.480 --> 00:52:40.640]   Uh, and of course the course tech support for that would be kind of a nightmare
[00:52:40.640 --> 00:52:45.440]   But if they could just if they if they could have if they could also have like test app inside there that says
[00:52:45.440 --> 00:52:50.560]   Yeah, it turns out that it's running fine within virtual box and therefore it's not my problem
[00:52:50.560 --> 00:52:55.600]   Say hello. Say hello. Take it to lino vote the linovo store the mall next door. Oh wait
[00:52:55.600 --> 00:52:59.280]   There is no linovo store the mall next door. Would you like to take a look at our new mac books?
[00:52:59.280 --> 00:53:01.440]   How would you like a trip to china?
[00:53:01.440 --> 00:53:05.600]   Yeah, it feels more like, you know, the mac is they have the mac is a kid and iphone is a kid
[00:53:05.600 --> 00:53:08.080]   And you have one kid who's just taking up all your time and effort right now
[00:53:08.080 --> 00:53:11.440]   And it's all you don't love the other kid and if someone tried to take it away and adopt it you'd be like, no
[00:53:11.440 --> 00:53:15.040]   That's my kid leave it alone. You know, you're not paying a lot of attention to it right now
[00:53:15.040 --> 00:53:20.720]   I feel I feel like it's more like you've got two kids one of them is like a
[00:53:20.720 --> 00:53:24.720]   Brilliant brilliant musician brilliant brilliant actor
[00:53:24.720 --> 00:53:28.480]   Uh that while you they're on the tonight show and they were there in a new movie
[00:53:28.480 --> 00:53:31.680]   They're in the new garden. See the gardens of the galaxy. They've got a one-person show
[00:53:31.680 --> 00:53:36.240]   And you've got another one that is working for livery mutual insurance
[00:53:36.240 --> 00:53:41.600]   And they've been working there for 15 years and now they're in a senior position. That's a boring job
[00:53:41.600 --> 00:53:45.680]   It's a very steady job. They're good people. They're raising kids beautifully
[00:53:45.680 --> 00:53:50.080]   Uh, they have not been found passed out underneath the table at the golden globes anytime
[00:53:50.080 --> 00:53:56.640]   But just because the other kid has the flashier job the one that yes, yes, I'm her. I'm her mother
[00:53:56.640 --> 00:54:02.800]   I'm her. I'm her father like oh well my I have another I have also another daughter and she's great too
[00:54:02.800 --> 00:54:11.040]   But hey, did you see her in guardians of the galaxy when when group trips over that alien who's like in a bag? That's that's Gloria. That's my Gloria
[00:54:11.040 --> 00:54:17.200]   Yep show them some love they're for they're both good. You're both good kids. It's my Gloria
[00:54:17.200 --> 00:54:21.680]   We take a break come back with more I showed it a brought to you by the tracker
[00:54:21.680 --> 00:54:24.640]   Newsweek estimates
[00:54:25.520 --> 00:54:32.000]   The average american wastes 55 minutes a day looking for things they own but can't find and I'm gonna vouch for that
[00:54:32.000 --> 00:54:37.280]   This morning I heard beep beep beep in the other room is Lisa looking for her phone
[00:54:37.280 --> 00:54:42.640]   She pressed the tracker button the phone screams the tracker and this is it's a tiny little thing
[00:54:42.640 --> 00:54:48.480]   Now what I do is I keep a tracker on my keys and then I keep my keys. I'm cheap chained
[00:54:48.480 --> 00:54:50.400]   To my uh bag
[00:54:50.400 --> 00:54:54.400]   So that way if I either lose the bag or leave the keys or the bag behind
[00:54:54.960 --> 00:54:56.960]   the tracker will bzzz
[00:54:56.960 --> 00:54:58.480]   and
[00:54:58.480 --> 00:55:02.960]   vice versa if I can't find my phone and press this button on the tracker the phone goes
[00:55:02.960 --> 00:55:10.560]   Or whatever sound you program even if it's silenced, but that's just that's just the beginning the black tracker is also a bluetooth
[00:55:10.560 --> 00:55:15.920]   Uh device bluetooth le so you pair it to your phone your phone can actually control up to
[00:55:15.920 --> 00:55:18.480]   Uh, I think it's a ten different trackers
[00:55:18.480 --> 00:55:24.400]   So put one on your bike put one in your luggage put one on your remote controls wherever it is that you
[00:55:24.800 --> 00:55:28.800]   You lose things and then if you leave let's say your keys if you leave your keys behind
[00:55:28.800 --> 00:55:34.640]   Let's say I had a great night in the tables in vegas. I was playing blackjack really excited got so excited
[00:55:34.640 --> 00:55:36.640]   I left my keys on the table
[00:55:36.640 --> 00:55:41.360]   Now I could go back up to my room and I could check my phone and it would tell me the last place
[00:55:41.360 --> 00:55:46.080]   It saw the keys and be on a map on the phone, but let's say things get worse
[00:55:46.080 --> 00:55:48.320]   Let's say
[00:55:48.320 --> 00:55:55.200]   Some Macedonian sees my keys on the blackjack table and picks them up accidentally and brings them back
[00:55:55.200 --> 00:56:02.800]   Home with him now what do I do because of course bluetooth tracking is only good for a hundred feet as soon as you get out of range
[00:56:02.800 --> 00:56:04.880]   That's the last time your phone saw it
[00:56:04.880 --> 00:56:11.600]   But if somebody moves it then what do you do? Well, that's why I think this is the best choice the tracker has the world's largest
[00:56:11.600 --> 00:56:17.120]   Crowd gps network. That's because there are more trackers out there than any other
[00:56:17.520 --> 00:56:23.680]   bluetooth device not just in the us but let me let me zoom out here all over the world
[00:56:23.680 --> 00:56:26.320]   three and a half million
[00:56:26.320 --> 00:56:32.080]   Trackers that's a last count. What did they tell us Lisa when we talked on the phone was like a hundred thousand a month they were doing
[00:56:32.080 --> 00:56:34.560]   It was a huge number
[00:56:34.560 --> 00:56:37.440]   So that's great. That means as you
[00:56:37.440 --> 00:56:40.080]   Travel anywhere
[00:56:40.080 --> 00:56:41.840]   You're gonna have people with trackers
[00:56:42.240 --> 00:56:48.320]   If you if your keys end up in Macedonia the next time somebody walks by your keys with the tracker software on it
[00:56:48.320 --> 00:56:54.560]   It's gonna say hey, I see leo's keys and it's gonna go. Hey leo. I just saw your keys. They're in mass
[00:56:54.560 --> 00:56:56.560]   Adonia
[00:56:56.560 --> 00:57:00.560]   Not that that will help me much. Hopefully you'll find your keys before they end up in mass
[00:57:00.560 --> 00:57:01.520]   Adonia
[00:57:01.520 --> 00:57:07.200]   This is uh, this is this is a cool map by the way if you go to the tracker t h e t r a c k r dot com
[00:57:07.200 --> 00:57:10.400]   It shows the growth starting january 21st
[00:57:11.120 --> 00:57:16.800]   To now this is one month's worth of growth these guys are doing so well
[00:57:16.800 --> 00:57:19.520]   Because they invented something brilliant
[00:57:19.520 --> 00:57:24.240]   Th e t r a c k r dot com no e

[00:58:33.040 --> 00:58:35.040]   Oh, you lose your phone again. Yes
[00:58:35.040 --> 00:58:37.840]   It's not that she lost it. It's just uh
[00:58:37.840 --> 00:58:46.560]   You know somewhere somewhere. It's not lost. It's not lost until I buy a new one. Yes here's somewhere
[00:58:46.560 --> 00:58:49.200]   It's here somewhere
[00:58:49.200 --> 00:58:51.360]   uh, so
[00:58:51.360 --> 00:58:54.000]   Berkshire Hathaway
[00:58:54.000 --> 00:58:58.160]   Warren no no less of a investment light than Warren buffet
[00:58:59.360 --> 00:59:03.520]   Stocked up on apple stock. They have a 6.6 billion dollar
[00:59:03.520 --> 00:59:10.080]   Investment as of the end of the year. That's an increase of 200 percent in the fourth quarter
[00:59:10.080 --> 00:59:12.080]   That's even before
[00:59:12.080 --> 00:59:19.200]   Apple's numbers came out on the iPhone 7 obviously Warren buffet took one look at it and said bye. Bye. Bye
[00:59:19.200 --> 00:59:22.240]   That's a yeah, I mean
[00:59:22.240 --> 00:59:26.400]   I I mixed feelings on this. I mean it's a great show of faith in apple, but it's the guy who buys coke in jollette
[00:59:27.280 --> 00:59:31.200]   Um, well, he's look you can't knock Warren buffet. He knows what he's no not at all
[00:59:31.200 --> 00:59:34.720]   But he doesn't usually buy hot startup tech he usually buys you know very established
[00:59:34.720 --> 00:59:38.240]   That you know what's interesting is he usually buys value stocks
[00:59:38.240 --> 00:59:44.240]   Which are companies that are undervalued by the market because that's where you're going to see the best growth
[00:59:44.240 --> 00:59:47.440]   No one could argue that apple is undervalued unless
[00:59:47.440 --> 00:59:52.640]   Unless it is. Yeah, I mean ironically undervalued. Yeah, um, so
[00:59:54.480 --> 01:00:00.160]   They had as of this I can get you ready for this so much they they made a billion dollars basically in two months
[01:00:00.160 --> 01:00:08.240]   They had 6.6 billion dollars as of december 31st as of tuesday. It would be worth 7.7 billion dollars
[01:00:08.240 --> 01:00:11.920]   You million here a few million there all of a sudden it's real money. Holy cow
[01:00:11.920 --> 01:00:18.640]   Yeah, it does take money to make money if you have but but just think of that kids if you had 6.6 billion
[01:00:18.640 --> 01:00:20.480]   You could have another
[01:00:20.480 --> 01:00:24.240]   Made a billion dollars in last two months and also they can't take their money
[01:00:24.240 --> 01:00:29.200]   Back into the united states for various reasons. Well, Warren buffet can
[01:00:29.200 --> 01:00:35.200]   Okay, here you go. He can he could sell that stock and in the cash out, but he's not apparently
[01:00:35.200 --> 01:00:37.200]   Um
[01:00:37.200 --> 01:00:43.520]   So there you go. It's just you know for all of the talk about his apple in trouble. Are they struggling his tim cook got the right path
[01:00:43.520 --> 01:00:46.320]   Man, that is that is an amazing
[01:00:46.320 --> 01:00:50.000]   Success story
[01:00:50.240 --> 01:00:57.120]   Let's talk more rumors this from macworld magazine a release date for the apple car
[01:00:57.120 --> 01:01:01.280]   Oh
[01:01:01.280 --> 01:01:05.120]   It's a it's a long long winter
[01:01:05.120 --> 01:01:10.080]   You're cooped up in your home office with nothing to report about
[01:01:10.080 --> 01:01:15.840]   And you start typing all work and no news makes check it dull boy over and over again
[01:01:15.840 --> 01:01:18.560]   maybe stop staying in
[01:01:18.560 --> 01:01:20.160]   in
[01:01:20.160 --> 01:01:28.160]   Big resorts on the winter over the winter. So this is uh, this doesn't mean a launch of the i car but according to the rumor
[01:01:28.160 --> 01:01:33.760]   Project titan has been given to late 2017 to prove its feasibility
[01:01:33.760 --> 01:01:41.840]   So they do that regularly they have executive views for all major projects regularly and the last executive view for titan is what led to big
[01:01:41.840 --> 01:01:45.520]   bomb a man's field coming back and everything that happened after that so I mean
[01:01:45.520 --> 01:01:48.240]   That should be happening all the time
[01:01:48.240 --> 01:01:54.400]   Is a regular intervals financial time says actually we mentioned this maybe we didn't a while ago the mclaren rumor
[01:01:54.400 --> 01:01:59.200]   Wow, they cited three sources saying apple is and talks to buy mclaren what
[01:01:59.200 --> 01:02:06.320]   That would make no sense. Um, so this is this is kind of a this is a macworld uk rundown of all
[01:02:06.320 --> 01:02:15.120]   The rumors the page that shows up high on google. Yeah, so the question is uh, is there really any news here? What's the uh
[01:02:16.560 --> 01:02:20.880]   What's the last thing we heard was that they've got to back down on they were letting people go and
[01:02:20.880 --> 01:02:25.920]   They changed it. They changed it from uh, like a hardware platform to a software platform
[01:02:25.920 --> 01:02:30.320]   So to speak all right if there if there was any chance of them actually shipping an apple car
[01:02:30.320 --> 01:02:32.640]   I now it thinks that's next to mill
[01:02:32.640 --> 01:02:36.960]   I think they've they've they're they're seeing a lot of the data that at least two other companies
[01:02:36.960 --> 01:02:43.520]   Have which is to say that it is such a why why would you just like apple has smartly said
[01:02:43.920 --> 01:02:48.640]   Why would we make like $50 blister pack like contract free phones?
[01:02:48.640 --> 01:02:54.320]   You can sell the drug store when we can make cajillions only selling the seven or 800 or $900 phone
[01:02:54.320 --> 01:02:59.600]   Uh, and most of these companies have been looking into this i have also said why would we why would we just in
[01:02:59.600 --> 01:03:04.320]   To dive head first into that pile of broken glass known as starting a
[01:03:04.320 --> 01:03:11.680]   Huge complex auto company when we can just help an existing auto company make cars and sell them to
[01:03:12.160 --> 01:03:18.560]   Cities as self-driving buses and self-driving taxis and self-driving trucks. It's just there's just no money in it
[01:03:18.560 --> 01:03:22.000]   How's your japanese guys?
[01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:27.440]   Because i'm looking at what it got because i must and i'm looking at this mako makotakara
[01:03:27.440 --> 01:03:31.360]   Blog out of japan and that sure looks like a red iphone
[01:03:31.360 --> 01:03:35.120]   In the buns every year since iphone 3g we've had this room where i love it
[01:03:36.800 --> 01:03:42.640]   That's not fair like they just like type a bunch of squiggles there they could be saying anything
[01:03:42.640 --> 01:03:48.240]   Then later on they say oh well that squiggle meant exactly the features of the new iphone and we were right
[01:03:48.240 --> 01:03:50.400]   Oh, he's a can just for sure
[01:03:50.400 --> 01:03:56.880]   Well, we're just people who understand this language. We were just taking their word for it on what all this stuff means
[01:03:56.880 --> 01:04:01.920]   We are gonna have a red iphone and everybody will love it and nobody will be sad
[01:04:02.480 --> 01:04:07.280]   I'm just i'm just saying that they could be all having a really big laugh at our expense or at least my expense
[01:04:07.280 --> 01:04:13.120]   I buy a red iphone. I love it. I mean they had a red ipad the ipad touch one product read a while ago and we just
[01:04:13.120 --> 01:04:18.480]   Now this is not a new iphone. This is the old iphone the iphone 7 but with red
[01:04:18.480 --> 01:04:23.280]   Yeah, usually they do the new colors like if you look at their pattern, it's gold for the iphone 5s
[01:04:23.280 --> 01:04:26.640]   It's rose gold the iphone 6s and then iphone 7 didn't get a new design
[01:04:26.640 --> 01:04:30.800]   But once again got a new color with the black so they usually do it when they're not doing a big design upgrade
[01:04:30.800 --> 01:04:35.920]   To still make the product look new and fresh. So if iphone 7s and iphone 7s plus don't
[01:04:35.920 --> 01:04:41.840]   Don't physically look different than having a red version would still once again make people. Oh, look you have the new iphone
[01:04:41.840 --> 01:04:45.920]   I'm just gonna say those of you who mocked me
[01:04:45.920 --> 01:04:51.680]   For buying a jet black iphone and not using a case all this time still looks fabulous
[01:04:51.680 --> 01:04:58.480]   And love it. It's the most attractive phone i've ever owned. Yeah, there are just as apple said little hairline
[01:04:59.360 --> 01:05:06.080]   Scratching that just as they as they say on antiques rocho good honest good honest wear good honest wear
[01:05:06.080 --> 01:05:11.200]   The only the real negative and I I'm guessing your matte black doesn't do this is fingerprints
[01:05:11.200 --> 01:05:15.680]   You got to wipe this thing off a lot because it really I use both like I switched between them still and yeah
[01:05:15.680 --> 01:05:18.400]   I have to clean it before I take any of those instagrams. Yeah
[01:05:18.400 --> 01:05:25.120]   Lots of fingerprints. I mean that doesn't bother me, but I I realize that that's probably unsightly for people with if they're using close up
[01:05:25.120 --> 01:05:29.280]   Where I notice it now mostly is because I got a car mount finally for the car
[01:05:29.280 --> 01:05:32.400]   It's like just to have like serie and all the different navigation stuff
[01:05:32.400 --> 01:05:34.800]   And if i'm driving away from the sunset that screen
[01:05:34.800 --> 01:05:38.480]   But can I tell you something same thing with the
[01:05:38.480 --> 01:05:41.520]   The tesla of that big 17 inch screen
[01:05:41.520 --> 01:05:46.000]   You don't really want to see it when the sun just right man this finger is disgusting
[01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:48.640]   Yeah, oh my my my
[01:05:48.640 --> 01:05:54.960]   My iPad too. It looks it looks like someone gave birth near it. Okay after at the end of a long work
[01:05:55.280 --> 01:05:57.280]   There you go
[01:05:57.280 --> 01:06:02.080]   So maybe maybe we'll get a red one that would this would be in the march announcement where they will also announce
[01:06:02.080 --> 01:06:03.760]   Uh,
[01:06:03.760 --> 01:06:11.200]   iPad pro 2 according to the same analyst, which is a bark lays analyst. I pad pro 2 12.9. I pad pro 2 9.7
[01:06:11.200 --> 01:06:13.600]   iPad pro 7.9
[01:06:13.600 --> 01:06:17.920]   That's a mini right. Yep, and the 10.5 inch iPad
[01:06:17.920 --> 01:06:20.640]   Pro but he says that'll be in may
[01:06:20.960 --> 01:06:25.600]   Yeah, it's just a screen size. It's the same size as the seven as the nine three seven. It just got edge to edge. Right
[01:06:25.600 --> 01:06:30.880]   Let's confusing when you word it that way. Yeah, and remember with the with the ipad line
[01:06:30.880 --> 01:06:34.720]   They've had been very very they've seen a lot of good a lot of common sense and
[01:06:34.720 --> 01:06:40.800]   Allowing a real wide spread of price points even if means keeping older machines with older
[01:06:40.800 --> 01:06:44.080]   CPUs still on the market. So if they say a 9.7
[01:06:44.080 --> 01:06:49.200]   It might not necessarily meet a brand new ipad with a brand new CPU. It could mean well
[01:06:49.200 --> 01:06:53.120]   We just you can still get the 9.7 inch version of the of the ipad
[01:06:53.120 --> 01:06:57.520]   But it only has 16 gigs of memory, but hey, that's that's plenty for most people. Yeah
[01:06:57.520 --> 01:07:06.480]   Uh, is this credible that there would be may well, I guess maybe available in may announced in march
[01:07:06.480 --> 01:07:11.040]   But available. Yeah, it's a huge question because like some people are saying why would you go edge to edge with the ipad now and
[01:07:11.040 --> 01:07:13.840]   And not say that as your big surprise for the ipad 8
[01:07:13.840 --> 01:07:19.040]   Um, but you know the apple tensor ship things when they're ready and it might just be ready and the right season for it
[01:07:19.280 --> 01:07:23.680]   Well, also, there's there's so much more room inside an ipad to make decisions like that
[01:07:23.680 --> 01:07:28.960]   Right, and I think it's just it's just going to be it's it's easier to do the i and for for all we know
[01:07:28.960 --> 01:07:35.120]   It could be a wave from them just to see if certain qc programs inside the factory are working correctly before they commit
[01:07:35.120 --> 01:07:42.080]   Uh to the iphone because remember it's it's still if if uh, if the design of the next iphone is
[01:07:42.080 --> 01:07:48.560]   Falling the same path as previous ones apple is still having a lot of discussion about what it's going to be and what it's going to have
[01:07:48.880 --> 01:07:52.320]   And they haven't yet committed to one single set of hardware features yet
[01:07:52.320 --> 01:07:56.560]   Well, I yeah, I really hate doing rumors, but frankly
[01:07:56.560 --> 01:07:59.760]   Again, it's a long way
[01:07:59.760 --> 01:08:04.560]   Is the season this is this is what we do before we decide which are the two dogs
[01:08:04.560 --> 01:08:07.600]   We like least I want to cook and eat because we're running out of food
[01:08:07.600 --> 01:08:14.560]   We're sick of boiling snow for water. Oh, let's see. What have I missed what there must be a story in here somewhere
[01:08:15.440 --> 01:08:18.880]   There's a lot you write there's a lot of think pieces about you know
[01:08:18.880 --> 01:08:26.320]   Well, we talked about the one yesterday last week where apple is is struggling to make mna deals and
[01:08:26.320 --> 01:08:33.360]   For the first here's one from forbst for the first time the tim cook here and the tim cook here apple's finally firing in all cylinders
[01:08:33.360 --> 01:08:35.360]   And this is just you know silly
[01:08:35.360 --> 01:08:38.320]   We watched carpool carrioke last week right we did that
[01:08:38.320 --> 01:08:44.160]   I love grovers take on that where he's like oh look the mergers and acquisitions guys the apple needs more mergers and acquisitions guys
[01:08:44.960 --> 01:08:47.280]   But did we talk about wdc?
[01:08:47.280 --> 01:08:49.680]   Oh, they announced it
[01:08:49.680 --> 01:08:56.320]   Yep, and they announced it's going to be in san jose this year first time in quite a few years. I think finally wdc comes home
[01:08:56.320 --> 01:08:59.520]   June 2002 was it june was last time in that way?
[01:08:59.520 --> 01:09:02.240]   Yeah, june fifth through ninth
[01:09:02.240 --> 01:09:04.880]   uh, we're in san jose
[01:09:04.880 --> 01:09:07.440]   Uh, where mccaren the mccaren
[01:09:07.440 --> 01:09:12.800]   So the extent i forget what it's like mccanry mccanry. Oh, it's named after the old mayor mayor mccanry
[01:09:12.960 --> 01:09:17.280]   The mccanry convention center that's the convention center downtown san jose. That's nice. Yeah, there's a great
[01:09:17.280 --> 01:09:21.040]   My recommendation great original jose around the corner there and go go have a nice
[01:09:21.040 --> 01:09:23.920]   Play the pasta. Yeah, I was
[01:09:23.920 --> 01:09:27.600]   I'm making my decision or whether to put aside some money for wdc this year
[01:09:27.600 --> 01:09:28.560]   I actually
[01:09:28.560 --> 01:09:35.440]   actually spent some time in google maps like walking around that neighborhood because I think i've been to one thing at the convention center
[01:09:35.440 --> 01:09:37.040]   years ago
[01:09:37.040 --> 01:09:39.040]   and it's like because most of my
[01:09:39.680 --> 01:09:43.200]   I think the the having it in san jose so close to apple is
[01:09:43.200 --> 01:09:45.920]   Really a big win for everybody
[01:09:45.920 --> 01:09:47.120]   uh particularly
[01:09:47.120 --> 01:09:50.320]   It's not just the convenience of apple having it so close to the campus
[01:09:50.320 --> 01:09:54.880]   But it means that you can have apple engineers there and not have to take off
[01:09:54.880 --> 01:10:00.640]   All take off a whole day from their work schedule. They can just that's what apple said. Yeah, it's an hour of there an hour back
[01:10:00.640 --> 01:10:04.880]   It's the way they can get to yeah exactly they can get they can get lunch and just go over there and come back
[01:10:05.280 --> 01:10:10.720]   Um the only and there's more hotel availability. There's not as as much inventory
[01:10:10.720 --> 01:10:15.440]   But again today on my own selfish look I was seeing well how much was if I wanted to go
[01:10:15.440 --> 01:10:20.880]   Would I want to stay in san francisco and commute or would I want to go to san jose and san jose hotel rooms there?
[01:10:20.880 --> 01:10:25.360]   There are a lot more than the last time I priced yes san jose hotel more than they were last week
[01:10:25.360 --> 01:10:28.960]   But there's still about a hundred bucks less a night than you can get in san francisco
[01:10:28.960 --> 01:10:33.040]   the only the only downer it would seem to be is that it really san jose
[01:10:34.080 --> 01:10:40.160]   As big as it is it's not like san francisco where people who are coming in from london and the east coast
[01:10:40.160 --> 01:10:46.160]   Who still want who still want to do stuff at two or three or four in the morning can still go out and do stuff? It's
[01:10:46.160 --> 01:10:51.600]   It's like oh there's yeah. Hey the word is that there is a vending machine
[01:10:51.600 --> 01:10:56.000]   Outside gas station where you could that's takes bills. We can actually get a pepsi
[01:10:56.000 --> 01:11:00.880]   So it's strangest thing. I live in san jose for many years. It's a great town. It's safe
[01:11:01.280 --> 01:11:07.440]   Uh the area of the civic center is not exciting at all and they they still roll up the sidewalks
[01:11:07.440 --> 01:11:10.000]   You know in the evening and that's pretty much it
[01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:14.320]   Um, however, it's it's a nice community. Um, yeah
[01:11:14.320 --> 01:11:17.440]   Enjoy cocktails late into the night in that area. Yeah, there's bars
[01:11:17.440 --> 01:11:19.920]   Like anywhere, right? Right?
[01:11:19.920 --> 01:11:25.600]   And and to be fair people are there to get might get get a return on their investment of their time and their money
[01:11:25.840 --> 01:11:32.640]   So they're not necessarily there for a week's vacation. Although it's a nice add-on that people will come in who don't have tickets
[01:11:32.640 --> 01:11:35.360]   Just to hang out with hang out with people that
[01:11:35.360 --> 01:11:39.600]   Instead of flying all over the world to meet with three or four people that they need to meet with
[01:11:39.600 --> 01:11:44.640]   They can just get a hotel get a suite in san francisco and just hang out with all these people
[01:11:44.640 --> 01:11:49.600]   Once at a time so there might be a better focus there might be a loss of people who might be applying for tickets
[01:11:49.600 --> 01:11:53.840]   Just to get in get into the carnival atmosphere. Like I said, it's it's hard to find a
[01:11:54.400 --> 01:12:00.480]   Real negative about moving the movie show this way. It's so as it feels very much like a kind of small Midwestern
[01:12:00.480 --> 01:12:05.360]   Not small mediums in western city and it's just not san francisco
[01:12:05.360 --> 01:12:09.520]   But you know the tech museum is just around the corner. That's was way, you know, steve wasney
[01:12:09.520 --> 01:12:12.720]   I put a lot of money into it's a great tech knowledge museum. There's an iMacs
[01:12:12.720 --> 01:12:15.280]   Um, they're great to bring the kids
[01:12:15.280 --> 01:12:21.760]   Moscone south and north are under construction. So there's less stuff to maneuver. Oh, you think that's what happened that they can't
[01:12:21.760 --> 01:12:24.720]   West is file west is still open but north and south are under construction
[01:12:24.720 --> 01:12:26.800]   They're making huge huge add-ons
[01:12:26.800 --> 01:12:31.440]   But but I don't even if they were available. I think that this is this this made the decision easier
[01:12:31.440 --> 01:12:34.240]   I think for apple as opposed to force their hand to move to san francisco
[01:12:34.240 --> 01:12:38.880]   It's also the beginning. I mean certainly from now on apple events will be on new apple campus
[01:12:38.880 --> 01:12:43.680]   Yeah, and that's that's also that was also part of my thinking that i'm going to have to get used to
[01:12:43.680 --> 01:12:48.640]   I'm gonna have to find answers to how do I do and how do I tend an apple event in
[01:12:49.200 --> 01:12:52.080]   If you say no say is slow cooper team
[01:12:52.080 --> 01:12:55.760]   You have to solve these huge logistical problems. Yeah
[01:12:55.760 --> 01:13:01.040]   Right. I think there's a great hawaiian barbeque just around the corner. Is there a fill?
[01:13:01.040 --> 01:13:04.080]   I need to know
[01:13:04.080 --> 01:13:08.640]   Actually, there might be by now, but cooperatino is not known for its deep sophistication
[01:13:08.640 --> 01:13:14.880]   It's always been I would much rather take the stay in san francisco and then either take the cal train or even an uber
[01:13:14.880 --> 01:13:16.800]   Or or a zip car
[01:13:16.800 --> 01:13:20.000]   Down there as more expensive as it is as hassle
[01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:26.640]   And you could take as train so yeah, the cal train stops close by then it's only about eight or nine bucks
[01:13:26.640 --> 01:13:31.520]   Via lift to get there. That's how it got around when I was there if he couldn't use there
[01:13:31.520 --> 01:13:33.680]   There are two fills coffees near
[01:13:33.680 --> 01:13:38.160]   Nearby on steven's not to do the not to do the humble brag thing
[01:13:38.160 --> 01:13:41.040]   But I got to talk to phil shiller on the record about this because he was so excited
[01:13:41.040 --> 01:13:43.280]   Um about moving to the new
[01:13:43.280 --> 01:13:45.920]   location because there's a fill
[01:13:46.400 --> 01:13:50.640]   No, because he said it's like a real homecoming for ww dc and then apple has been striving to do
[01:13:50.640 --> 01:13:54.240]   You know, they're they're working with the city because they know it's not san francisco
[01:13:54.240 --> 01:13:58.400]   And they want to to get together some fun experiences and some fun events for all the people participating
[01:13:58.400 --> 01:14:02.400]   Uh, and also that they want to keep working on accessibility and things like that the only thing
[01:14:02.400 --> 01:14:05.120]   And I don't know if it's a bummer or not, but they can't change
[01:14:05.120 --> 01:14:11.040]   The capacity it's still gonna have the same number of people as if they held it which is weird because that's a bigger place, right?
[01:14:11.040 --> 01:14:15.280]   Or no, so there's just a limit to the amount of apple engineers in labs and all the different people have to stop
[01:14:15.840 --> 01:14:18.960]   Not a people you can fit in the sessions and all those sorts of things. Yeah, yeah
[01:14:18.960 --> 01:14:26.960]   Okay, well, you know, it's not look you go in there to learn about what's new from apple and how to develop for it and all that
[01:14:26.960 --> 01:14:32.160]   I mean, that's that's the real and I would say anybody's interested in that the less distraction the better
[01:14:32.160 --> 01:14:36.720]   And google moved south bay last year for ios. I mean, it's it looks like it's right. It's right google's down there too
[01:14:36.720 --> 01:14:38.720]   And they're and they're doing it again this year
[01:14:38.880 --> 01:14:47.040]   There there's there's only just one side comment that again, it really is nice to have the entire family together once in one place
[01:14:47.040 --> 01:14:49.920]   And when it's always under controlled events
[01:14:49.920 --> 01:14:54.400]   It's a little it's it's not as free flexing that hey i've heard about this
[01:14:54.400 --> 01:14:58.320]   I heard about this Italian restaurant that has a japanese chef
[01:14:58.320 --> 01:15:03.200]   And let's go out. Let's go there tonight and not have to go 20 miles away or 30 miles away
[01:15:03.200 --> 01:15:05.360]   as opposed to here is
[01:15:05.360 --> 01:15:12.000]   Here are the three sanctified locations that apple has set up to make sure that the kitchen is prepared for engineers
[01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:16.880]   For every for every single food allergy every single nitpicky thing
[01:15:16.880 --> 01:15:22.000]   And also every single piece of wall hanging that's going to be judged and vlogged about
[01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:28.240]   We are setting we're making sure the people all of these restaurants and hotels are laying down the rubber sheets on all the furniture
[01:15:28.240 --> 01:15:30.400]   So that when we
[01:15:30.400 --> 01:15:32.080]   Do that voodoo that we do so well
[01:15:32.400 --> 01:15:35.360]   They will be able to reset it for the next convention of orthopedists
[01:15:35.360 --> 01:15:38.960]   I lived in san jose in late 70s early 80s and I still have a lot of fire
[01:15:38.960 --> 01:15:44.320]   On some ways it's almost like my hometown. It was the beginning of my adult life was in san jose and I really liked it
[01:15:44.320 --> 01:15:49.920]   And that was a very exciting time apple and a tari and and it was just it was a go-go time
[01:15:49.920 --> 01:15:52.880]   Uh, but it but it's always puzzling going back there
[01:15:52.880 --> 01:15:55.040]   You know the san francisco 49ers move down there too
[01:15:55.040 --> 01:15:57.680]   So we go to san eclair to the stadium and leave by stadium
[01:15:58.160 --> 01:16:04.000]   It's puzzled me that here you have it's a big town and there's lots of people and some of the biggest companies in the world are there
[01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:05.920]   in that area
[01:16:05.920 --> 01:16:07.680]   Because that's silicon valley
[01:16:07.680 --> 01:16:13.440]   But san jose, which is the big city is very sleepy. It's funny. It's just you know, it's pretty but
[01:16:13.440 --> 01:16:18.240]   It's just not exciting. Yeah, I guess, you know
[01:16:18.240 --> 01:16:27.360]   Uh, so we saw last week we saw that uh, there was a strong rumor that apple had made a deal with sam san for 160
[01:16:27.840 --> 01:16:29.280]   million
[01:16:29.280 --> 01:16:31.280]   OLED displays
[01:16:31.280 --> 01:16:33.920]   shortly before that
[01:16:33.920 --> 01:16:37.520]   Actually, I guess we we could have mentioned on the show was on valentine's day
[01:16:37.520 --> 01:16:43.760]   So I don't know if we mentioned this but I don't think we did apple a rumor that apples and chalk talks with another supplier boe
[01:16:43.760 --> 01:16:50.240]   For flexible oled displays, which is interesting. It doesn't mean you can shake them around and wave them
[01:16:50.240 --> 01:16:56.480]   It just means that they can wrap around there be like the sam san galaxy s8 or a 7 edge, which I really like but
[01:16:57.040 --> 01:17:01.440]   Uh, that you know, I have to say there are issues with this kind of bezel list design. It's hard to hold
[01:17:01.440 --> 01:17:05.760]   Uh without putting your fingers on the screen. You can't basically
[01:17:05.760 --> 01:17:11.520]   Bumper 8.0 will fix everything. Yeah, well, well, we'll also I think we talked about this last week
[01:17:11.520 --> 01:17:17.760]   There's there's a lot of like a palm and fingertip rejection technology that's already in existing ipads
[01:17:17.760 --> 01:17:23.440]   Oh, it works it works on the sam san but it just it doesn't well, it's it's i don't want to hold it by the screen
[01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:29.120]   Well, it's it's an aesthetic thing when sam san had the curved edge designs a couple years ago
[01:17:29.120 --> 01:17:31.360]   They were trying to make the edges
[01:17:31.360 --> 01:17:35.920]   Do something like have a have a like a ticker on the side that would have sports scores and things like that
[01:17:35.920 --> 01:17:42.480]   And now they've accepted that. Okay. It's just a thing that makes our phone look cool or helps it to blend in with the with the with the
[01:17:42.480 --> 01:17:43.760]   with the desktop
[01:17:43.760 --> 01:17:47.360]   And apple is nothing if they're not appreciative of how to make things look cool
[01:17:47.360 --> 01:17:52.160]   And also any trick that they can pull to make make up the the next iphone look
[01:17:52.560 --> 01:17:54.560]   So different from the last one
[01:17:54.560 --> 01:18:01.200]   That it will just give you an extra 12 points towards deciding that i don't care if i bought an iphone 7 last year
[01:18:01.200 --> 01:18:04.080]   I don't care that it's still working perfectly. I want the new one
[01:18:04.080 --> 01:18:14.080]   Just before we begin the show so i'm not gonna put you on the spot apple rolled out macos 10 12 for public beta
[01:18:14.080 --> 01:18:19.440]   Three and 10.3 public beta three for the iphone and the ipad
[01:18:20.960 --> 01:18:24.000]   You probably haven't had a chance to play with those at this point
[01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:29.280]   So I got the developer betas but i've there's been so much to do at work that i haven't had time to really play with them
[01:18:29.280 --> 01:18:29.920]   I didn't like again
[01:18:29.920 --> 01:18:34.320]   I did notice that feature where I was at the restaurant and suddenly let me scan my cards and add up my stuff
[01:18:34.320 --> 01:18:39.520]   Which I thought was really great. Oh, you mentioned that. Yeah, yeah, but i haven't had time to dug into everything that it does yet
[01:18:39.520 --> 01:18:42.720]   These are public is should people
[01:18:42.720 --> 01:18:46.880]   Do them or it's I mean when you get to beta three, that's pretty
[01:18:47.600 --> 01:18:52.240]   It's if you want to delay access all the latest features as immediately as possible
[01:18:52.240 --> 01:18:57.760]   And you're not adverse to a few bugs, you know, including re springs or sorry springboard crashes or I haven't had any problems with it
[01:18:57.760 --> 01:19:02.160]   And like you said, it's the third beta now so it's more solid and we'll probably get this for release around march
[01:19:02.160 --> 01:19:04.800]   So it gives you a few extra weeks to play with it then go for it
[01:19:04.800 --> 01:19:07.520]   But if you're somebody who has mission critical stuff where you need your phone to work
[01:19:07.520 --> 01:19:12.800]   Like you work on call or something like that and just always stay away and stay away from the release for a week or two as well
[01:19:12.800 --> 01:19:15.440]   Yeah, it depends on your tolerance
[01:19:15.760 --> 01:19:18.320]   You know, I recommend staying away only because
[01:19:18.320 --> 01:19:24.400]   There there are there rarely any features that oh my god if only I could start using this incredible feature
[01:19:24.400 --> 01:19:29.680]   Three weeks before anybody else. I don't think there's it's rare that there's anything like that in a beta
[01:19:29.680 --> 01:19:31.520]   and secondly
[01:19:31.520 --> 01:19:34.160]   Some at least my experience has been once you have
[01:19:34.160 --> 01:19:41.680]   Once a machine has become a beta device you find yourself on the beta track and you have to I find it hard to make sure that I could
[01:19:41.680 --> 01:19:44.240]   I've switched back to the general release
[01:19:44.800 --> 01:19:46.800]   Installation after that
[01:19:46.800 --> 01:19:52.640]   But if you I would definitely recommend it if you are if any you're in any way the position of having to do tech support
[01:19:52.640 --> 01:19:55.920]   For your friends and your family or your people at work
[01:19:55.920 --> 01:20:03.360]   It's stable enough to use as your day-to-day. Although it is a beta and it will let you experience issues or differences before anyone does
[01:20:03.360 --> 01:20:05.680]   There's nothing I think all three of us understand
[01:20:05.680 --> 01:20:13.280]   Appreciate there is nothing more embarrassing than confidently saying oh, okay. Just go into settings go into general now under keyboard
[01:20:13.520 --> 01:20:17.680]   There's there's nothing on there. No, no general then settings and then keyboard
[01:20:17.680 --> 01:20:23.440]   Okay, fine. I've got my phone in front of me. I'll be damned. That's not there anymore. Why do they put holy catch? Why do they move that?
[01:20:23.440 --> 01:20:28.400]   So train yourself, but don't trust your phone to it yet. Yeah, yeah
[01:20:28.400 --> 01:20:31.040]   Oh
[01:20:31.040 --> 01:20:33.040]   Let's see
[01:20:33.040 --> 01:20:36.800]   I guess apple is gonna do a series three apple watch at least
[01:20:37.280 --> 01:20:40.080]   Wow, not getting out of the business. It's but it's doom. Nobody buys smartwatch
[01:20:40.080 --> 01:20:41.680]   at least there
[01:20:41.680 --> 01:20:46.160]   There's rumors from digit times that they're gonna be trying a new something called a glass
[01:20:46.160 --> 01:20:49.120]   film
[01:20:49.120 --> 01:20:52.160]   Display what is a glass film touch screen?
[01:20:52.160 --> 01:20:58.000]   I'm not sure because I did that it's I have had a chance to read it and it looks like technical jargon
[01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:03.280]   Yeah in place of the current touch on lens solution, which I didn't know what that was either
[01:21:04.240 --> 01:21:10.960]   So it probably wouldn't make any difference from the end user point of view, but it maybe a lot of it is implementation details. Yeah
[01:21:10.960 --> 01:21:14.240]   All right, I'm
[01:21:14.240 --> 01:21:18.640]   I'm making an apple watch three. Yeah, the question is when I mean it took him a year and a half to do apple watch too
[01:21:18.640 --> 01:21:21.600]   So would it would it really be a year later? Would it be a year and a half later again?
[01:21:21.600 --> 01:21:24.320]   And I have to say what's missing
[01:21:24.320 --> 01:21:29.680]   Some people like it depends on who you talk to again. Everyone has different answers
[01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:35.200]   Georgia my colleague Georgia would tell you she wants an always-on display and the ability for it to fit underneath the cuffs of her pantsuits
[01:21:35.200 --> 01:21:42.240]   Because right now it's a little bit too thick for that. So, you know, it depends if you want more fashionable choices or you want more practical choices
[01:21:42.240 --> 01:21:48.080]   I would wear a lot for battery life. I would wear it more if it looked better. It it floats like a little pillow on my wrist
[01:21:48.080 --> 01:21:54.320]   And I don't know if that's because the lugs are where the lugs are positioned on them watch itself or what but
[01:21:55.440 --> 01:22:00.400]   It doesn't look that good. I like a round face too. You know, I'm wearing right now wearing a gear s3
[01:22:00.400 --> 01:22:05.760]   From Sam's we we hardly even noticed it on your wrist there was so
[01:22:05.760 --> 01:22:12.240]   Svelte and well, it's big but rap, but it looks more like a regular watch, right? It doesn't yeah, yeah, but that bicep
[01:22:12.240 --> 01:22:17.280]   Leo, that's getting impressive. Are you like that? It tries. Yeah, I mean just moving a lot around is giving you no
[01:22:17.280 --> 01:22:22.720]   That was and I wore that for very little time that the android wear 2.0 from LG
[01:22:22.720 --> 01:22:27.760]   They'll just sport that thing was uncomfortable. So I gave it to Jason. Hell. He says it's too uncomfortable to wear it too
[01:22:27.760 --> 01:22:32.080]   So that that's why I actually got this is the s3 frontier and then I got it just to say
[01:22:32.080 --> 01:22:36.720]   And you know, well, what else is out there? And this is ties in this is not android
[01:22:36.720 --> 01:22:42.160]   But this is Sam's and it works on all uh android actually works on an iphone to all all phones
[01:22:42.160 --> 01:22:45.760]   Uh, I like it's got a great display. Um, not always on though
[01:22:45.760 --> 01:22:49.600]   No, nobody's doing that yet because it uses so much battery life, right?
[01:22:49.840 --> 01:22:55.360]   Yeah, I mean, but a normal person just expects a watch to be honest. We're just used to the watch being weird. Yeah, yeah
[01:22:55.360 --> 01:23:01.040]   I do like the bezel. I think this control bezel is a better way to uh to do a watch
[01:23:01.040 --> 01:23:04.160]   Then feels like a combination lock
[01:23:04.160 --> 01:23:10.080]   Well, and it feels it actually it you know sometimes not dials a larger dial with ballistics
[01:23:10.080 --> 01:23:13.360]   That feels good. You know what I'm saying? I like I
[01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:19.120]   Take take take take take take take yeah. Yeah, I gotta say that. I've stopped using the digital stem like
[01:23:19.120 --> 01:23:27.280]   After the first couple of weeks with the apple butch is just my my instinct is not to do this when I want to scroll my instinct is to do this
[01:23:27.280 --> 01:23:29.360]   And despite
[01:23:29.360 --> 01:23:35.840]   And also it's in the summer in the spring. It does get dunked up just enough that it there's going to be that little hesitation before it breaks
[01:23:35.840 --> 01:23:39.840]   View free of the sweat and the gunk and that's just enough that I just don't care about it
[01:23:40.480 --> 01:23:42.960]   It's not necessary. And so I use the alternatives
[01:23:42.960 --> 01:23:47.680]   All right, we got I'm gonna give a little extra time to the picks this week because one of the picks is going to take some time
[01:23:47.680 --> 01:23:50.960]   It's a big story and we'll get to that in just a moment
[01:23:50.960 --> 01:23:54.960]   But first a word from square space the place

[01:26:43.600 --> 01:26:46.960]   Uh on overcast
[01:26:46.960 --> 01:26:53.360]   Oh, I thought you meant pokemon leo i'm sorry well pokemon go is a big deal fifth. What is it 50 new pokemon?
[01:26:54.080 --> 01:26:55.520]   uh, well, yeah
[01:26:55.520 --> 01:26:59.520]   Well, we can do overcast first and i'll get to overcast because this has been getting a lot of news
[01:26:59.520 --> 01:27:02.160]   Marco armit is beloved a beloved developer
[01:27:02.160 --> 01:27:06.640]   It works at tumblr and he's done a lot of great stuff for the apple community insta paper
[01:27:06.640 --> 01:27:12.560]   And overcast is a great podcast app and he's really done a lot with his new one
[01:27:12.560 --> 01:27:18.800]   Yeah, so it was always an opinioned app which I I always like like I don't there there are apps that are just try to be
[01:27:18.800 --> 01:27:21.760]   Everything for everybody and they do a lot of things but not all of it
[01:27:21.760 --> 01:27:26.160]   Well, and then there are apps that are really opinionated take a stance say this we believe are the best way to do it
[01:27:26.160 --> 01:27:30.160]   And that's sort of like where you get your tweets butts from and where you get things like overcast from
[01:27:30.160 --> 01:27:33.680]   Uh, and it was it was my go-to podcast player for a long time
[01:27:33.680 --> 01:27:38.160]   Just because it made sense to me you'd go you'd find the episode and play it and marco has been evolving it
[01:27:38.160 --> 01:27:43.440]   Both the business model for it and the design for it for several generation now. This is the third version
[01:27:43.440 --> 01:27:45.680]   And this one is really different. It's a big change
[01:27:45.680 --> 01:27:48.240]   It's got sort of like a card metaphor now where things slide up
[01:27:48.560 --> 01:27:51.520]   Almost like music app and a lot of other audio apps these days
[01:27:51.520 --> 01:27:56.240]   And the way it works the mechanic of the way it works is a little bit different
[01:27:56.240 --> 01:28:00.160]   It took me a while to get used to it because my brain is not as elastic as it used to be
[01:28:00.160 --> 01:28:03.600]   But now I like it. It feels very fluid the way that you move through it
[01:28:03.600 --> 01:28:07.600]   It's also he's got a manual playlist now a lot of people wanted a q function or a
[01:28:07.600 --> 01:28:13.360]   Up next function and he always thought that his automatic playlist and where you could manually resort things was enough
[01:28:13.360 --> 01:28:15.600]   But now he's got a sort of a manual playlist
[01:28:15.600 --> 01:28:18.880]   You can just add things to it from anywhere in the interface as you go
[01:28:18.880 --> 01:28:24.240]   And he's changed the model again. So it's not just a freemium app or a spon like a
[01:28:24.240 --> 01:28:28.160]   So a patronized app, but it's got advertising in it
[01:28:28.160 --> 01:28:31.760]   And the change this time around is he's moving from google ads to sort of his own
[01:28:31.760 --> 01:28:36.400]   Ad platform because it's google ads were not they were closed and kind of gunky
[01:28:36.400 --> 01:28:38.800]   And he wanted to make a more streamlined experience
[01:28:38.800 --> 01:28:42.080]   Is this an example of the ad here in the lower left hand corner this fusion
[01:28:43.200 --> 01:28:47.840]   Or that's the album mark. No, that's that's the ad. That's the podcast art. Yeah, that's the park. That's
[01:28:47.840 --> 01:28:51.920]   So, so where were the what will the ads look like? I'm trying to find this is his
[01:28:51.920 --> 01:28:54.160]   I'm a paid customer
[01:28:54.160 --> 01:28:58.160]   They might they might be there somewhere. Do you think the patreon
[01:28:58.160 --> 01:29:01.280]   plan didn't work or
[01:29:01.280 --> 01:29:05.440]   He says it didn't work as well as it used to and sort of I think the ads are a twofold approach
[01:29:05.440 --> 01:29:09.360]   I think it's very sunsue where you have the ads in there, but they don't really make a lot of income
[01:29:09.360 --> 01:29:12.800]   But what they do is they help encourage a few more percentage of people to jump into pro
[01:29:13.120 --> 01:29:18.080]   Like it's never been great conversion on iOS historically like people will just suffer through ads rather than pay
[01:29:18.080 --> 01:29:20.320]   It's never been a great motivator for people to go pay
[01:29:20.320 --> 01:29:25.600]   But it's probably enough that it moves the indicator for him enough into the the paid version that it's worth doing
[01:29:25.600 --> 01:29:29.040]   Marco hates us because he never ever
[01:29:29.040 --> 01:29:33.040]   Shows any of our podcasts and any of his stuff, but that's okay. Oh, you're beloved
[01:29:33.040 --> 01:29:37.360]   You can't be that's all right. Well, we you know, I think because he doesn't do video
[01:29:37.360 --> 01:29:42.720]   I think that might be something about I mean we we certainly are an audio podcast for the
[01:29:42.800 --> 01:29:47.880]   Majority of our listeners, but also a lot of these are so it works. I shouldn't and shouldn't say it doesn't work for Matt
[01:29:47.880 --> 01:29:49.880]   Brigadier Lee does
[01:29:49.880 --> 01:29:56.080]   Quickly on time if you look at the list of podcast he's featuring it's people that he works with most of the time
[01:29:56.080 --> 01:30:02.080]   Right, so it's doesn't have to get permission to use their artwork and it can just sort of put them in there is a sort of a friendly gesture. It's okay
[01:30:02.080 --> 01:30:06.640]   Yeah overcast 3 and is it free free?
[01:30:07.200 --> 01:30:13.680]   Yeah, so it's free again you it is free. There is a paid you can become a pro or a paid customer or a supporter
[01:30:13.680 --> 01:30:16.960]   I forget what the exact terminology is but I paid for like three years in advance
[01:30:16.960 --> 01:30:19.120]   So I didn't want to think about it for a while
[01:30:19.120 --> 01:30:21.120]   and you just then that gets rid of
[01:30:21.120 --> 01:30:22.640]   I think you used to unlock features
[01:30:22.640 --> 01:30:26.400]   But then you decided that he was making he was making a worse experience people who didn't pay and therefore
[01:30:26.400 --> 01:30:31.040]   Discarding them from trying out the features that might convert them into paid customers. So he just made it
[01:30:31.040 --> 01:30:33.520]   free and now with ads nice
[01:30:34.960 --> 01:30:38.000]   Overcast 3.0. It's out and
[01:30:38.000 --> 01:30:43.920]   Is it just iPhone or do they have an iPad version? I don't think so. Yeah, it's iPhone. I bet it's universal
[01:30:43.920 --> 01:30:48.960]   They do have a discovered universal when he was playing with like play as ice classes one day. It was the accident all I bad
[01:30:48.960 --> 01:30:54.560]   Oh, I could do it and then you made it all nice and proper. All right. Yeah, like you said no video
[01:30:54.560 --> 01:30:57.360]   And there's a web client as well if you want to listen on your Mac
[01:30:57.360 --> 01:30:59.520]   uh, so
[01:30:59.520 --> 01:31:03.120]   Mr. Renee Richie you might as well talk about Pokemon
[01:31:03.520 --> 01:31:09.440]   So funny, this was like all we talked about for weeks and then yeah, I mean it's still like when you uh, so
[01:31:09.440 --> 01:31:13.120]   It's a fascinating case study and I'd like to really hear more in depth about it one day
[01:31:13.120 --> 01:31:17.920]   But basically they were too successful too early on and they programmed for this is what we think is going to be our success level
[01:31:17.920 --> 01:31:21.440]   This is the built-in buffer that we have and this is what it ended up being
[01:31:21.440 --> 01:31:24.240]   And there was just even google server and structure just crumbled
[01:31:24.240 --> 01:31:28.960]   And it created a bad experience and they had massive amounts of of engagement at launch
[01:31:28.960 --> 01:31:33.200]   But they lost a lot of it because they had to go back and rewrite everything and because they were redoing everything
[01:31:33.200 --> 01:31:38.960]   They couldn't start adding new features. So he did an interview last week where he said that we had player versus player and trading
[01:31:38.960 --> 01:31:41.280]   And we would have chipped at least one of those things last year
[01:31:41.280 --> 01:31:46.560]   But we spent so much time just getting the game up and running for the amount of users that we had that it pushed back our roadmap
[01:31:46.560 --> 01:31:49.440]   Considerably so now they're sort of back on track
[01:31:49.440 --> 01:31:52.000]   And they released pokemon go generation two
[01:31:52.000 --> 01:31:57.200]   And that's 80 new uh, they already had previously released the babies that you could hatch mags last year
[01:31:57.200 --> 01:32:02.480]   Sounds funny saying but that's part of the game mechanic and now you have 80 new pokemon that you can go out and catch in the wild
[01:32:02.560 --> 01:32:04.560]   Nice and it's funny because um
[01:32:04.560 --> 01:32:09.280]   Like sometimes you'll say pokemon go on people go. Oh, I'm nostalgic. I remember other people would say what it was
[01:32:09.280 --> 01:32:10.560]   At any time
[01:32:10.560 --> 01:32:16.160]   But if you look at like if you look at google trends or you look at just internet traffic pokemon go spikes higher than an iphone still
[01:32:16.160 --> 01:32:22.240]   Like it is just incredibly popular and their servers went down again when then you update came in last week
[01:32:22.240 --> 01:32:25.280]   They got him back up fast to their credit. They got him back up in a couple hours
[01:32:25.280 --> 01:32:28.000]   That's again that's taking down google data centers, which is not an easy feat
[01:32:28.480 --> 01:32:33.680]   Uh, so I mean it is popular and when I go places I hear like, you know industry insiders and analysts go
[01:32:33.680 --> 01:32:36.880]   I thank you for writing about this stuff because we were confused and now we're playing way better
[01:32:36.880 --> 01:32:42.080]   So I think it's got a much bigger user base than you would commonly see people talk about on twitter and things like that
[01:32:42.080 --> 01:32:46.960]   But uh, it's it is a lot more to play now and uh, a lot of things have changed in the game
[01:32:46.960 --> 01:32:52.080]   Like which creatures can beat which creatures so people who have these very powerful armies not to go back and rebuild them
[01:32:52.080 --> 01:32:56.960]   So it's a leveled playing field in some ways for new people getting into the game. Well, here's something weird
[01:32:56.960 --> 01:32:59.360]   I don't know if this is uh part of the update
[01:32:59.360 --> 01:33:01.040]   but uh
[01:33:01.040 --> 01:33:02.800]   That's for your apple watch
[01:33:02.800 --> 01:33:05.840]   As soon as I uh because I'm using pokemon go on the apple watch
[01:33:05.840 --> 01:33:10.240]   So as I ran the new version, it said, uh, would you like to update your health?
[01:33:10.240 --> 01:33:12.240]   Data
[01:33:12.240 --> 01:33:16.320]   Yeah, so on the apple watch app is a workout app. It's not it's not just an apple watch app
[01:33:16.320 --> 01:33:21.280]   So what it does is it gives you credit like you'll hatch eggs and encounter pokemon and you'll get credit for the steps that you take
[01:33:21.280 --> 01:33:24.800]   So you literally start it up and you start up a workout and you choose a pokemon go workout
[01:33:24.800 --> 01:33:28.640]   So and then it'll track you as you're walking but you have to give it's a permission to do that
[01:33:28.640 --> 01:33:31.200]   Chikorita
[01:33:31.200 --> 01:33:34.000]   Cyndaquil and toto dial are here
[01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:37.520]   Wow actually they're here literally there's there's
[01:33:37.520 --> 01:33:42.640]   There's one right now. It's a gardener sent me a screenshot of uh
[01:33:42.640 --> 01:33:46.080]   Overcast with the imore show playing thank you gardener
[01:33:46.080 --> 01:33:51.520]   And uh, there's the ad at the bottom. So it's just it just like a lot of ads. It's just a little bottom
[01:33:51.920 --> 01:33:55.520]   Uh, little section there. Thank you gardener for sending that along
[01:33:55.520 --> 01:33:58.000]   so, um
[01:33:58.000 --> 01:34:00.000]   What level are you now trainer?
[01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:02.080]   I'm 36
[01:34:02.080 --> 01:34:03.600]   36
[01:34:03.600 --> 01:34:07.200]   Yeah, uh, but it takes forever like when you get to higher levels it takes months and months
[01:34:07.200 --> 01:34:09.280]   Some people are doing it some people got to 40
[01:34:09.280 --> 01:34:09.760]   I
[01:34:09.760 --> 01:34:12.800]   Someone made a calculator that would told you you're basically like how much you do a day
[01:34:12.800 --> 01:34:19.200]   And it said it would take me until like 2019 to get to level 40. So i'm not really i'm not really expecting much. Wow
[01:34:20.320 --> 01:34:24.080]   I like it because I I just use it while I work out. I have the walk it's a great workout
[01:34:24.080 --> 01:34:28.000]   Actually, and I have this great wilderness park next to my house
[01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:33.040]   That's just huge and I turn it on it pings me when there's little creatures there and it breaks up the monotony of the workout
[01:34:33.040 --> 01:34:34.960]   And I have podcast things I listen to as well
[01:34:34.960 --> 01:34:38.000]   But this is interactive and dynamic and it's literally encouraging me
[01:34:38.000 --> 01:34:42.320]   Like I know this egg is gonna hat if I just walk five kilometers instead of doing two kilometers
[01:34:42.320 --> 01:34:46.800]   Like a five kilometer. No, I think it's that has real value to it and having it on the watch is great because you can
[01:34:47.200 --> 01:34:50.560]   Get notified. I mean it just becomes part of your ritual as you're walking around
[01:34:50.560 --> 01:34:53.520]   And you get credit because like I got to get credit for those ring otherwise
[01:34:53.520 --> 01:34:56.160]   my time
[01:34:56.160 --> 01:34:58.320]   Thank you rene for the pokemon update and for the
[01:34:58.320 --> 01:34:59.760]   Guests
[01:34:59.760 --> 01:35:01.840]   Yeah, we went out this weekend and there was a haven't seen in a while
[01:35:01.840 --> 01:35:05.840]   But there was like I always see some people playing because we you notice the signs to look for yeah
[01:35:05.840 --> 01:35:10.160]   It's cold. It's cold in winter. So you really notice this is not wearing gloves for one thing
[01:35:10.160 --> 01:35:12.240]   We went we took uh my god kids
[01:35:12.240 --> 01:35:14.960]   We went to the olympic stadium because they have the botanical gardens there
[01:35:14.960 --> 01:35:19.360]   And there's a bunch of rare pokemon that spawn there and there's a bunch of families walking around again playing together
[01:35:19.360 --> 01:35:22.480]   Hadn't done it in in weeks or if not months. So it was a lot of fun to see
[01:35:22.480 --> 01:35:25.760]   I just caught my first wild center it or whatever it is
[01:35:25.760 --> 01:35:31.840]   And it's interesting now because there's like new game mechanics with some things you can't evolve unless you get special items to evolve them
[01:35:31.840 --> 01:35:38.560]   And some of them they evolve into different things depending on whether it's day or night or it's it's a little bit more complicated than before
[01:35:38.560 --> 01:35:42.400]   But I must have written 20,000 words on pokemon go this weekend so I'm
[01:35:43.840 --> 01:35:45.840]   You should get rings for that
[01:35:45.840 --> 01:35:51.840]   I mean it's so popular like it used to be that people would complain but now like thank you. I'm saving this yay
[01:35:51.840 --> 01:35:57.600]   Ooh a slugma. I haven't gotten one of those. Yeah, there's already a bunch of new stuff here. Oh, this is a red ring
[01:35:57.600 --> 01:36:02.640]   I don't know if i'm gonna catch him now. You don't just have raspberries leo you have
[01:36:02.640 --> 01:36:06.800]   Pineapples that give you double candy and you have banana is that make him easier to catch?
[01:36:06.800 --> 01:36:10.560]   Oh, you know what they're they're making them easy to catch just to kind of get me started
[01:36:10.880 --> 01:36:14.880]   So I got a I got a slugma now. Wow and it's yeah add it to your polka
[01:36:14.880 --> 01:36:18.240]   I already got two new pokemon and I just just sitting here
[01:36:18.240 --> 01:36:21.440]   Are you jealous?
[01:36:21.440 --> 01:36:22.960]   I just think it's like again
[01:36:22.960 --> 01:36:28.160]   I you could see like harry potter and amazing beasts versions of these games and just ways of getting people out into the world
[01:36:28.160 --> 01:36:31.760]   Were they gonna do that? That was the rumor they were gonna do that. I haven't seen that yet
[01:36:31.760 --> 01:36:37.040]   Yeah, I think again like the amount of people who took down those servers made them rethink their entire mode
[01:36:37.600 --> 01:36:42.800]   Yeah, well like you could see terminator versus bugs bunny or something. I mean there's a lot of things so much you could do
[01:36:42.800 --> 01:36:45.360]   That's terminator versus smurfs like you hunt down smurfs with the terminator
[01:36:45.360 --> 01:36:52.320]   There's all sorts of things you could do. Oh, it's just fun in the real world poke pokemon says i'm going too fast. I should gps drift
[01:36:52.320 --> 01:36:54.480]   Yeah gps drift. I suddenly
[01:36:54.480 --> 01:36:57.360]   Wait a minute another one
[01:36:57.360 --> 01:36:59.360]   Holy cow a second centred
[01:36:59.360 --> 01:37:03.200]   Annie while i'm catching the wild centred in its native lair
[01:37:03.600 --> 01:37:08.000]   Why don't you tell us about your pick of the week? Well my pick of the week is a game
[01:37:08.000 --> 01:37:11.920]   It's also about working with animals, but they're not fake animals. They're really
[01:37:11.920 --> 01:37:19.840]   It's it's a game called dog sled saga, which I first saw like in development form at
[01:37:19.840 --> 01:37:24.640]   PAX east a couple of years ago, and I just remember I was on the app store. Oh my god
[01:37:24.640 --> 01:37:27.440]   They actually released it. It's great. It's a dog sled mushing game
[01:37:27.440 --> 01:37:33.280]   But it's exactly the sort of game I love because it's the pixel art is gorgeous
[01:37:34.240 --> 01:37:39.840]   And the mechanics start off really really simple starts off as a very very basic game where
[01:37:39.840 --> 01:37:46.160]   You're driving your sled dogs and they keep going because you throw them treats
[01:37:46.160 --> 01:37:48.880]   So you have to keep paying attention to your dogs when they start panting
[01:37:48.880 --> 01:37:52.640]   You need to throw them a treat and there's a game mechanic to make sure you hit it correctly
[01:37:52.640 --> 01:37:57.600]   You then gets a little bit more complicated because now you have a limited amount of treats to get to the
[01:37:57.600 --> 01:38:00.160]   To get you to the end of the end of the trail
[01:38:00.880 --> 01:38:06.720]   And then as you keep playing it now you get to understand that each of your dogs has a different
[01:38:06.720 --> 01:38:10.080]   Personality and just like in real dog sled racing
[01:38:10.080 --> 01:38:12.880]   There's a there a dog's personality
[01:38:12.880 --> 01:38:18.720]   May work great if you put him or her close to the sled in what's called wheel position
[01:38:18.720 --> 01:38:22.720]   Or it might this if they're smarter and they're a little bit more spontaneous
[01:38:22.720 --> 01:38:26.720]   They might even they might work better in the lead position or you might discover that
[01:38:27.440 --> 01:38:31.280]   When you throw this dog one snack if you throw them another really quickly
[01:38:31.280 --> 01:38:38.080]   Then they'll really really respond or when they they really really come to life when they when they see like another team about to pass them
[01:38:38.080 --> 01:38:43.440]   So if you can sort of keep abreast of another team that that's that's within sight. That'll really work well
[01:38:43.440 --> 01:38:48.720]   You can it's like it gets to be a little bit like car racing games where there's a season
[01:38:48.720 --> 01:38:53.600]   And you have to manage your kennel because you've just you've just taken like your your team out
[01:38:53.920 --> 01:38:59.840]   And now you have to give them some rest and you have the option of either just letting them rest or you can play with them
[01:38:59.840 --> 01:39:02.480]   Or you can like give them training
[01:39:02.480 --> 01:39:04.880]   And so it becomes
[01:39:04.880 --> 01:39:07.120]   Not more complicated but more rich
[01:39:07.120 --> 01:39:11.840]   As you start to get involved in okay. Well, I need to for this race. I need eight dogs
[01:39:11.840 --> 01:39:17.760]   I'm gonna have to this one is too tired. I want to use him. This one is it's a long distance race at night
[01:39:17.760 --> 01:39:21.200]   So I don't think I'll want her in lead positional swap out this other dog
[01:39:22.080 --> 01:39:27.760]   But at the at its at its core, it's just a fun beautiful engaging game
[01:39:27.760 --> 01:39:34.560]   I just love this sort of pixel art animation and the depth of it just reminds you of what would happen if you had
[01:39:34.560 --> 01:39:38.480]   Uh like a sega game with a modern cpu
[01:39:38.480 --> 01:39:45.440]   So four bucks, uh and i'm i've been playing it like kind of constantly for the past three four days since i've rediscovered it
[01:39:45.440 --> 01:39:47.920]   I can't wait
[01:39:47.920 --> 01:39:48.960]   mush
[01:39:48.960 --> 01:39:50.960]   mushy huskies
[01:39:51.040 --> 01:39:53.040]   It's how much four bucks
[01:39:53.040 --> 01:39:58.640]   Have some treats fail for the ipad or the iphone so you don't get like this is a scaled up ipad version
[01:39:58.640 --> 01:40:02.480]   That's real ipad version. So as you know, I've been in a continuous quest
[01:40:02.480 --> 01:40:05.920]   To test all the mesh router solutions out there
[01:40:05.920 --> 01:40:10.080]   Iro a sponsor one of them google used that
[01:40:10.080 --> 01:40:11.760]   uh
[01:40:11.760 --> 01:40:13.120]   Uh
[01:40:13.120 --> 01:40:15.760]   I have a home. I have the net gear orbeez
[01:40:16.400 --> 01:40:21.280]   Those are really fast. They're not technically mesh, but they're doing something very interesting
[01:40:21.280 --> 01:40:27.280]   I've had probably the best results so far with the orbeez although I keep trying more and I just set up the amplify
[01:40:27.280 --> 01:40:32.480]   ht this is ubiquity who kind of invented mesh. Yeah, uh, this is their consumer version
[01:40:32.480 --> 01:40:40.160]   Uh a little less expensive than some of the other choices out there for the three units that the base station and two
[01:40:40.560 --> 01:40:46.000]   Remotes it's 349, uh, dollars list price shop around you might get it for a better deal
[01:40:46.000 --> 01:40:52.400]   That's the hd and that's the one I'd recommend they have a hf that doesn't do, uh, ac it only does
[01:40:52.400 --> 01:40:54.560]   abg and n
[01:40:54.560 --> 01:41:01.040]   And it doesn't have as many maimo antennas and all of that the hd is the one and this by the way covers quite a large area
[01:41:01.040 --> 01:41:04.800]   And one of the reasons I mentioned on mac break weekly. It's easily the most pretty
[01:41:04.800 --> 01:41:09.840]   And mackish of the bunch this base unit this square base unit
[01:41:10.320 --> 01:41:13.040]   Shows a clock has lights you tap it
[01:41:13.040 --> 01:41:18.000]   It has a touch screen and you can get additional information including and this is for me very valuable
[01:41:18.000 --> 01:41:25.520]   The total amount of bandwidth that's gone through this because I'm on Comcast and they seem to care about that kind of thing
[01:41:25.520 --> 01:41:31.280]   These two remote units just plug into the wall now that could be good or bad there. There's no wires
[01:41:31.280 --> 01:41:33.120]   It's a lot more convenient
[01:41:33.120 --> 01:41:37.120]   But generally people have wall plugs at you know kind of ankle height
[01:41:37.520 --> 01:41:41.040]   And of Wi-Fi had worked best if you'd have it up higher in the air. So
[01:41:41.040 --> 01:41:47.920]   You know, maybe that's a negative what's cool about this is their magnet these antennas are held on by magnet to the base
[01:41:47.920 --> 01:41:52.560]   So it even if you knock it it just pops off and pops right back on
[01:41:52.560 --> 01:41:57.280]   So it uh, it looks like they might be a little risky to have those sticking out from the wall
[01:41:57.280 --> 01:42:03.440]   But in fact, uh, it's it's not bad at all. I think it's a pretty good system. I found good speeds
[01:42:04.000 --> 01:42:08.640]   Um so far the of all of them that i've tested the orbi has the highest speed
[01:42:08.640 --> 01:42:13.280]   Uh the amplified software as ios and android compatible works very well
[01:42:13.280 --> 01:42:17.920]   Uh is very easy. It was the easiest to set up in fact. I didn't have to do any setup
[01:42:17.920 --> 01:42:20.800]   Unlike any of the other units you plug in the base station
[01:42:20.800 --> 01:42:25.600]   Plug in the remote units base station finds it configures the remote units and you're good to go
[01:42:25.600 --> 01:42:29.760]   There's no configuration at all, which I think is a lot better
[01:42:30.320 --> 01:42:38.000]   Supports all the usual, you know things and do dads and bells and whistles all of these mesh routers are pretty comparable in that capability
[01:42:38.000 --> 01:42:41.280]   This at this point you have some really good choices and i'm not sure which
[01:42:41.280 --> 01:42:48.160]   You would pick aesthetically. I think the amplifies that is it is kind of cool because it has the the screen
[01:42:48.160 --> 01:42:51.280]   It's a little more visual. You can turn the screen and the lad's off
[01:42:51.280 --> 01:42:56.720]   Um, but but I like to have little readouts and things like that. So, uh, I I can
[01:42:57.200 --> 01:43:03.840]   Uh, definitely recommend the amplify HD from ubiquity the people who kind of invented this whole system for years ubiquity
[01:43:03.840 --> 01:43:06.480]   Owned it and it was mostly used in enterprise
[01:43:06.480 --> 01:43:10.320]   But was not used much at home because you had to have a java enabled
[01:43:10.320 --> 01:43:13.360]   Uh pc to configure and control it
[01:43:13.360 --> 01:43:16.240]   They've gotten better on the enterprise
[01:43:16.240 --> 01:43:20.400]   It's nice because if your lg display goes off when it turns on at least you have the display on the router
[01:43:20.400 --> 01:43:25.040]   Uh, I you know, I can't decide which I would you like the best?
[01:43:25.040 --> 01:43:30.000]   You know, I have a soft spot for euro is the first one I used and I you know, I've set it up for a number of people now
[01:43:30.000 --> 01:43:35.440]   My mom's using euro. She's very happy with it. I love that on almost all of these I can check in on
[01:43:35.440 --> 01:43:39.680]   Remote league, so i'm gonna I think i'm gonna set my daughter up
[01:43:39.680 --> 01:43:44.800]   Uh probably use I have a leftover google home. That's the one I like the least the google
[01:43:44.800 --> 01:43:47.600]   Wi-fi so probably she says what she's gonna get
[01:43:47.600 --> 01:43:51.200]   Uh, but it's but if the but if her internet goes down or my mom's goes down
[01:43:51.200 --> 01:43:56.480]   I can quickly check on the app and see what's going on with that same thing for the amplify amplify hd
[01:43:56.480 --> 01:43:59.040]   349 list
[01:43:59.040 --> 01:44:04.320]   For three units and they also sell like everybody else additional units to extend it
[01:44:04.320 --> 01:44:09.200]   Um, do you use one of these uh, Renee or using just a regular everyday router?
[01:44:09.200 --> 01:44:13.040]   I still have my apple time capsule. I was thinking of getting
[01:44:13.040 --> 01:44:18.320]   Uh the euro but doesn't ship to Canada and they looked at the other ones don't ship to Canada and it was such a pain
[01:44:18.320 --> 01:44:21.440]   The i'm not gonna try to get anything across the border. I think you guys have different
[01:44:21.440 --> 01:44:26.240]   Do you have different Wi-fi bands is that maybe they just never submitted it to the crtc for approval?
[01:44:26.240 --> 01:44:30.080]   That's probably what it is. Yeah, or it's just more complicated to arrange international shipping
[01:44:30.080 --> 01:44:34.160]   But i've drooled upon them at several of my friends places when i've been a really
[01:44:34.160 --> 01:44:36.320]   Do they make a difference?
[01:44:36.320 --> 01:44:38.320]   Amplifies yeah, they make a difference
[01:44:38.320 --> 01:44:43.600]   Uh, we have a fairly it's all one story so our house is really spread out
[01:44:44.160 --> 01:44:48.240]   And and we need something we've never had good Wi-Fi in that house
[01:44:48.240 --> 01:44:52.320]   And we have Jerry hilden brand like you looking at all the different ones and he's just under to do it
[01:44:52.320 --> 01:44:58.000]   So good. So whatever you guys pick will win. Well, I picked I you know, I wanted to review the amplify because uh
[01:44:58.000 --> 01:45:00.880]   Was it in gadget one of them said this is the best?
[01:45:00.880 --> 01:45:05.120]   So I said well, that's the one I haven't tried so and I've I've had a lot of respect for ubiquity
[01:45:05.120 --> 01:45:09.440]   And I'm very happy with it. The setup was is easy peasy and that's one nice thing
[01:45:09.440 --> 01:45:13.120]   Hey, I have another tip for you the twit store is now selling
[01:45:13.760 --> 01:45:16.720]   Make twit great again hats. Oh
[01:45:16.720 --> 01:45:21.920]   Actually, it is already great Leo. It doesn't say I don't because we don't need to we are great
[01:45:21.920 --> 01:45:26.160]   We could you could choose from the twit logo or twit.tv in writing

[01:45:47.920 --> 01:45:51.760]   I don't you like that. I really like that one. Anthony nelson is uh, uh,
[01:45:51.760 --> 01:45:54.640]   Are in house designer for a lot of these. He just does a great
[01:45:54.640 --> 01:46:00.720]   Great job, but the hats are out and these are nice hats very nice hats 25 to 27
[01:46:00.720 --> 01:46:04.320]   I don't know why the logo is is two dollars more
[01:46:04.320 --> 01:46:07.520]   Maybe oh, it's got one more color. I bet you that's why
[01:46:08.480 --> 01:46:09.840]   Huh?
[01:46:09.840 --> 01:46:16.400]   It's and and oh and if you want a red hat. Yeah. Yeah, we sell them. That'll really confuse your friends and neighbors

[01:46:26.960 --> 01:46:32.240]   And uh, we do it we do it for fun. I mean, it's not uh, I don't think this is a big bunny maker
[01:46:32.240 --> 01:46:36.720]   It's not a way we support ourselves, but we do know that some of you want these and so
[01:46:37.520 --> 01:46:41.200]   Popular demand we've made them to it that tv slash
[01:46:41.200 --> 01:46:45.200]   Store less we're sending a box of these to be on safe for kids
[01:46:45.200 --> 01:46:50.960]   Mice one pick one picture one picture on instagram. It'll be on say can you imagine?
[01:46:50.960 --> 01:46:56.000]   How north west what is it in south west? What's the other one? I can't remember
[01:46:56.000 --> 01:47:01.680]   Uh, how many things like that must show up at the door every day. Yeah every day
[01:47:01.680 --> 01:47:04.240]   Just just ways
[01:47:04.240 --> 01:47:06.240]   Please wear these days where the
[01:47:06.240 --> 01:47:14.160]   All right ladies and gentlemen, uh, oh I get it one has a curved brim and one has a flat brim
[01:47:14.160 --> 01:47:20.720]   I see we have the $25 for the flat brim 27 for the curved brim. I get it
[01:47:20.720 --> 01:47:27.360]   And that's for the kid amount of precision a precision that goes into that curving process
[01:47:27.360 --> 01:47:29.200]   It's not just random not easy
[01:47:29.200 --> 01:47:34.800]   Their fault tolerance is they throw out seven hats for every one they ship with the curve because the curve has to be spot
[01:47:34.800 --> 01:47:36.160]   That is so funny
[01:47:36.160 --> 01:47:39.680]   So the inside of the curve has to be just as good as the curve on the outside
[01:47:39.680 --> 01:47:43.360]   So you get a snapback or a stretch cotton your choice
[01:47:43.360 --> 01:47:50.720]   Ladies and gentlemen that could that could turn off my mic. It didn't conclude it that quickly
[01:47:50.720 --> 01:47:56.480]   That almost concludes this edition of mac break weekly. Thank you everybody for being here. Andy and aco
[01:47:56.480 --> 01:48:00.240]   You'll find him at the chicago sun times. That's where he hangs his hat
[01:48:00.240 --> 01:48:05.280]   You can also see him on the web at cwob.com the celestial waste of bandwidth
[01:48:05.280 --> 01:48:12.000]   And he does some very fine podcasts at relay.fm right next door to marco is marco in the next cubicle over there
[01:48:12.000 --> 01:48:18.400]   Yeah, and the coffee he he brews. He doesn't share it, but oh my god does it smell well? Oh, I bet it does
[01:48:21.200 --> 01:48:26.000]   Renee richy has his own podcast studio at imore.com up there in montreal
[01:48:26.000 --> 01:48:32.400]   imore is the place to go to get information about all things apple including pokimon go
[01:48:32.400 --> 01:48:37.120]   And if you want to listen, it's i'm more it's apple and more apple more
[01:48:37.120 --> 01:48:40.800]   Yeah, if you want to listen to the podcast just go to imore.com click the
[01:48:40.800 --> 01:48:46.480]   hamburger and look for the podcast menu and thank you for both of you for being here

[01:48:51.440 --> 01:48:55.840]   1900 utc if you want to stop by say I would love that

[01:48:59.760 --> 01:49:06.640]   twitter.tv/mbw and wherever finer podcasts are given away free of charge
[01:49:06.640 --> 01:49:09.680]   Do not pay for mac break weekly
[01:49:09.680 --> 01:49:12.080]   It's free
[01:49:12.080 --> 01:49:18.480]   Why I said that i'm thinking about is charging for it uh our tWIT survey is running out in about a week one week from today
[01:49:18.480 --> 01:49:20.400]   We're going to finish it up at the end of the month
[01:49:20.400 --> 01:49:26.400]   So we would love to hear from you if you haven't yet filled out the survey twit.tv/survey it helps us better understand our audience
[01:49:26.400 --> 01:49:32.480]   Make programming that fits your needs but most importantly it helps us tell advertisers what they're going to get
[01:49:32.480 --> 01:49:37.840]   Which makes it a little bit easier to sell because advertisers like anybody else don't like surprises
[01:49:38.320 --> 01:49:45.200]   So uh it would really help us take just a couple minutes is very quick this year twit.tv/survey
[01:49:45.200 --> 01:49:50.800]   Thanks for joining us everybody. We'll see you next week now back to work because you know what break time is over
