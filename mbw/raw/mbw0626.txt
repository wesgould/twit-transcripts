[00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:36.440]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly. While Leo is away gallivanting across Europe
[00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:41.440]   eating his way across Europe I believe he's left us here to play and that
[00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:46.080]   includes our rock our foundation Andy Inako. How are you Andy?
[00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:51.800]   I do feel like a block of cold and movable granted today. Thank you very much.
[00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:55.880]   Also joining us in playing the game once again is is it real or is it a render Alex
[00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:00.840]   Lindsey from the Pixel Core? I'm coming to you via VR you know it's that's the
[00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:05.960]   only way that that it works for me anymore. Alex's pixels look better than
[00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:11.240]   our atoms it's appalling. Also joining us one of my favorite people in the tech
[00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:14.160]   world because I get to work with her every day. Lori Gill from iMore how are you
[00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:22.160]   Lori? How's it going? Glad to be back. This is such a fun show because you could totally
[00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:27.880]   have it. That's because your hair looks halfway decent. This isn't an
[00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:32.480]   application this isn't style this is like I cannot do anything I've got only
[00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:36.240]   four hours after I get up on a Tuesday to get something going on with my hair
[00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:41.280]   and at the last minute hey how about a hat? I feel you're pain and you know I
[00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:45.000]   think like maybe women don't really realize that the hat is the solution to
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.280]   that problem because why have bad hair days all the time and I never think put
[00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:55.920]   on a hat I think go fix your hair. Look what it did for Sicily Tyson
[00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:01.280]   everybody's talking about that absolutely wonderful hat. I just know that no one's
[00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:05.320]   talking about her hair. Yeah the Boba fat helmet I think would do me well would
[00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:10.320]   have a good hat and a good face day would be awesome. So the invitations are out I
[00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:13.600]   think Apple probably waited till we were finished the show last week to send
[00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:18.520]   them out just like always but they did go out they have been received it is as
[00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:23.080]   widely suspected as I think we talked about for several weeks gonna be on
[00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:28.360]   Tuesday sorry Wednesday September 12th because September 11th the Tuesday day
[00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:33.160]   is akin to a Memorial Day in the US so the 12th makes a lot of sense. Now the
[00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:37.320]   invitation confused some people right out of the gate because it was a circle
[00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:44.320]   and that led to all sorts of internet social blog YouTube podcast speculation
[00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:50.040]   that oh my god we're getting round watch faces or a round phone or no this is the
[00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:54.840]   logo for Apple Park it is the literally the ring building at Apple it is on all
[00:03:54.840 --> 00:04:00.560]   the t-shirts at Apple Park so the model. I was imagining I was imagining
[00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:05.320]   Ultimate Frisbee at the Apple Park which would be outstanding.
[00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:09.280]   >> Mark has Brownlee would win though I mean you would do MKVHD would just win so it
[00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:13.440]   wouldn't be fair but no it is the Apple T-shirt the Apple Park logo but they do
[00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:17.520]   say gather around Andy do you have any tea leaf reading on this is this just
[00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:21.560]   Apple being cute or are they gonna start putting us squares into round pegs.
[00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:26.200]   >> No I think that they're just talk I really do think they're talking about
[00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:32.160]   AR I think I think they're gonna be talking about how good the essentially
[00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:36.840]   it's because we're not looking forward to any really huge revelations in the
[00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:40.520]   new iPhones I really think that most of the hardware discussion is going to be
[00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:44.320]   about hey here's how good this is for AR and hey here's how many more objects
[00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:48.520]   we can render and hey here's how we've reduced the lag and particularly hey
[00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:51.880]   looked how expensive all these other augmented reality devices that are only
[00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:56.800]   for developers are and yet we're putting the power and the and the glory of
[00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:00.000]   advanced augmented reality in your hands.
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.680]   >> I thought this was actually something that Alex and Tony Stark built in a cave
[00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:08.240]   out of scraps and it'll be the new source of power for all of Apple's gadgets.
[00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:14.160]   >> Actually you mean that yeah I actually thought that now if they're
[00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:18.360]   giving away anything and believe I have to I think we all have to preface this by
[00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:22.160]   saying that I will credit you because I think you're the first person to actually
[00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:26.560]   articulate this that people that the graphic designers at Apple are laughing
[00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:31.080]   and laughing and laughing at everybody just dissecting this image but the thing
[00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:35.360]   that came to mind was that it is ring but it is copper and I was thinking maybe
[00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:41.480]   it is a cheap charger charging and maybe we're gonna actually see the new charger.
[00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:47.080]   >> That's what I was just gonna ask does anybody know what a cheap charger like
[00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:49.200]   the actual hardware looks like.
[00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:50.200]   >> The coils.
[00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:52.400]   >> Yeah the coils because that seems like it would make sense.
[00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:59.040]   I have a wireless charger on the bottom of my cup that actually looks like the
[00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:00.040]   invitation.
[00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:02.000]   >> So the new Apple watch.
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.720]   >> Yeah that comes to my mind.
[00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:08.520]   >> Or maybe gold because the phone is gonna be gold again.
[00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:12.360]   Could that be a hint just how and not based we'll get to that in a second but
[00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:15.920]   based on some of the images we're seeing it's not champagne gold like the early
[00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:20.760]   iPhones it's not rose or blush gold like the subsequent iPhones but this is full on
[00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:22.760]   Cardassian style.
[00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:25.280]   >> You go reach gold.
[00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:31.640]   >> Yeah it is like Trump gold it is you can't buy class but you can put gold leaf on it.
[00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:32.640]   >> Yes.
[00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:38.240]   >> And as the Bruins fans will attest it is black and gold finally.
[00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:41.720]   What is a Pittsburgh team Alex or the or the Pennsylvania team?
[00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:45.880]   >> Well Pittsburgh yeah and the Eagles are silver and
[00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:48.600]   green but the Steelers are black and gold.
[00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:51.920]   >> So is this something all Steelers fans all Bruins fans have been waiting for
[00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:54.160]   for Apple to finally get on the right page?
[00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:58.480]   >> Finally they found their way to the right place.
[00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:02.920]   It took us about time we can forgive them it's Apple.
[00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:07.720]   >> So there's the picture 9 to 5 Mac scored this some people again I love everybody in
[00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:09.720]   the blogger YouTube podcast community.
[00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:13.560]   Some people thought these were marketing images leaked by Apple to generate buzz.
[00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:16.480]   You can only suspect that absolutely nothing about Apple.
[00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:20.840]   There is no universe where Phil Schiller and Greg Jawswiak were anything but Apple
[00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:27.560]   plectic about somebody somebody somebody is on their way home.
[00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:34.120]   Somebody realize that if I want to quit but if I quit I don't get unemployment insurance
[00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:36.040]   payouts if I get fired.
[00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:42.320]   No I don't I mean I think that they'll obviously however it got out there'll be a lot of I'm
[00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:46.600]   sure that there'll be lots of meetings and discussions and how do we never have this
[00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:49.120]   happen again I don't think anyone probably lost their job over it.
[00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:54.000]   >> There was some speculation because Guillermo Rambo from 9 to 5 Mac who I believe found
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:58.600]   these images he was watching he also managed to find one of Apple's early test broadcast
[00:07:58.600 --> 00:08:03.200]   streams from the event but that was showing old stuff that was showing like the air power
[00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:09.200]   from last year that they don't test it with leaks with marketing images of unreleased products.
[00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:10.280]   That's just not how they go.
[00:08:10.280 --> 00:08:15.560]   So it's possible that Apple for years has been doing sort of a security through obscurity
[00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:19.680]   where they rely on people not knowing the names for URLs that are on publicly accessible
[00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:24.760]   web portals or slightly publicly accessible web portals and you could sit there and type
[00:08:24.760 --> 00:08:28.360]   things in and maybe get a match and because there's only two images it's not like they
[00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:32.920]   found every marketing image that's going to be coming up on the event.
[00:08:32.920 --> 00:08:38.600]   It's interesting but they did get out and Laurie the thing that that shook me at first
[00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:43.160]   was that the images which I believe is Jupiter on the top of these they make it look like
[00:08:43.160 --> 00:08:47.520]   a very short lava lamp or a very humped.
[00:08:47.520 --> 00:08:51.440]   But it's not really that's just the wallpaper on the phone right we're not going back to
[00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:52.920]   a rounded iPhone.
[00:08:52.920 --> 00:08:57.000]   >> Well I mean that kind of brings up the question of naming I mean maybe we're going
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:04.200]   to change iOS 12 into iOS Jupiter start giving our mobile software names the way we give
[00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:06.440]   our Mac software names.
[00:09:06.440 --> 00:09:07.440]   >> Right.
[00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:11.000]   >> There are like a couple versions of Mac OS minor updates that were named after the children
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:15.080]   of Greek gods like Damos and Phobos which are also moons I think or local.
[00:09:15.080 --> 00:09:16.880]   >> Yes something there.
[00:09:16.880 --> 00:09:24.600]   But yeah so these images got out we're looking at the phone Andy iPhone XS iPhone XS I think
[00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:27.240]   Snell said tennis and I can never unsee it.
[00:09:27.240 --> 00:09:29.080]   >> Is US Open Week.
[00:09:29.080 --> 00:09:33.480]   >> What do you think I mean it's an obvious name in hindsight because they've been using
[00:09:33.480 --> 00:09:38.440]   product name product name S as their cycle for years but I thought maybe once we got
[00:09:38.440 --> 00:09:41.880]   to Roman numeral 10 we'd be beyond that.
[00:09:41.880 --> 00:09:49.520]   >> Yeah it's weird they've I think it's a reflection of the difficulty that Apple has
[00:09:49.520 --> 00:09:53.600]   in competing with Android in one particular way.
[00:09:53.600 --> 00:10:00.000]   That is to have a diversity of hardware and a diversity of price points out there.
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:04.320]   Apple is the only company that's making iOS devices they're the only company that's making
[00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:09.680]   iOS phones which means that they really have to be able to anticipate everybody worldwide
[00:10:09.680 --> 00:10:10.920]   in what they want.
[00:10:10.920 --> 00:10:16.880]   And so last year I was pretty surprised that they basically I can't I can't remember how
[00:10:16.880 --> 00:10:21.040]   many phones they actually canceled last year but it seemed as though everything down to
[00:10:21.040 --> 00:10:26.640]   like the iPhone 5 was still on the price list like they were trying to make sure that no
[00:10:26.640 --> 00:10:33.160]   matter what if people don't have the extra $50 for the iPhone 7 iPhone 7 don't worry
[00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:34.760]   we'll sell you an iPhone 6.
[00:10:34.760 --> 00:10:40.240]   So I think they're coming to a point where they're going to have to have a more standardized
[00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:45.040]   name for a way to communicate people to make it really really clear what kind of a phone
[00:10:45.040 --> 00:10:46.040]   this is.
[00:10:46.040 --> 00:10:52.840]   I'm really really pleased if the rumors that we're looking at appear to be true that they're
[00:10:52.840 --> 00:10:58.040]   going to be giving the market a version of the I like a version of last year's iPhone
[00:10:58.040 --> 00:11:03.600]   10 only with like less by saving money where a place is where people aren't really going
[00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:08.840]   to notice like by switching out the stainless steel frame for aluminum switching out OLED
[00:11:08.840 --> 00:11:14.640]   for LED and letting people have something that is almost as great as last year's iPhone
[00:11:14.640 --> 00:11:20.440]   10 but let them have it for like iPhone 8 or even iPhones iPhone 7 or 6 prices.
[00:11:20.440 --> 00:11:24.160]   So that was my favorite part of the rumors that we're hearing for now.
[00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:32.280]   I love the idea of having a humongous phone because I still use my iPad mini even though
[00:11:32.280 --> 00:11:37.960]   it's oh my god does it feel so slow running the modern operating system because there
[00:11:37.960 --> 00:11:43.640]   are times where I need something that I don't even have something the size of a small sheet
[00:11:43.640 --> 00:11:49.000]   of paper to carry something around and I really do need something that is either more discreet
[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.720]   or that I can just toss into a jacket pocket.
[00:11:51.720 --> 00:11:58.960]   So I love the idea of having a 6.5 inch phone but really it is the idea of as always making
[00:11:58.960 --> 00:12:03.960]   the best technology available to people who don't necessarily have the money for what
[00:12:03.960 --> 00:12:07.880]   is now the luxury phone budget of a thousand bucks.
[00:12:07.880 --> 00:12:09.720]   I'm still stuck on the name.
[00:12:09.720 --> 00:12:13.640]   The opposite of you I actually prefer the 4 inch phone size.
[00:12:13.640 --> 00:12:20.600]   So I'm wanting the iPhone 10 body and hardware in a 4 inch form factor.
[00:12:20.600 --> 00:12:27.880]   So that's why I would love the low cost iPhone 10 style thing as well but I want it to be
[00:12:27.880 --> 00:12:29.680]   small or not larger.
[00:12:29.680 --> 00:12:31.160]   Yeah.
[00:12:31.160 --> 00:12:34.600]   So I want to get to look because the iPhone 9 or whatever Apple calls it hasn't leaked
[00:12:34.600 --> 00:12:38.400]   yet but this one did and I'm confused by the branding outlets when they went to when they
[00:12:38.400 --> 00:12:42.280]   first leaked last year Steve Troughton Smith famously leaked the firmware that had iPhone
[00:12:42.280 --> 00:12:46.640]   X or 10 and we didn't know which way they'd go and they ended up going with like Roman
[00:12:46.640 --> 00:12:49.680]   numeral 10 which I don't think is human readable anymore.
[00:12:49.680 --> 00:12:52.040]   People see X and it would have been easy to do.
[00:12:52.040 --> 00:12:57.960]   Okay iPhone X and then X2 X3 X4 it would have given them a decade of product runway but
[00:12:57.960 --> 00:13:03.000]   instead we went with 10 and now we have 10 S which is 10 S and people will read XS which
[00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:09.080]   is XS or XS or XS or XS because you're in Petaluma and from a branding point of view Alex I just
[00:13:09.080 --> 00:13:11.880]   don't I don't know where to go from here.
[00:13:11.880 --> 00:13:14.760]   I actually don't either.
[00:13:14.760 --> 00:13:21.320]   I mean I think that I think we might end up with you know the next year being iPhone
[00:13:21.320 --> 00:13:22.960]   and then just a weapon.
[00:13:22.960 --> 00:13:29.600]   I think it'll just be 11 like I think they're gonna turn and I think that their marketing
[00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:34.640]   see forget the rumors for this year let's talk about the rumors for next year.
[00:13:34.640 --> 00:13:38.800]   You know it's gonna be round the whole phone is gonna be round like a puck that's that's
[00:13:38.800 --> 00:13:43.120]   really what they're moving towards and it's just gonna be they're gonna it's gonna be
[00:13:43.120 --> 00:13:45.480]   a big dial and says turn it to 11.
[00:13:45.480 --> 00:13:47.960]   That's gonna be the marketing.
[00:13:47.960 --> 00:13:50.480]   I was gonna say that.
[00:13:50.480 --> 00:13:51.480]   Yeah.
[00:13:51.480 --> 00:13:53.360]   Yeah there is.
[00:13:53.360 --> 00:13:57.800]   There is no iPhone 9 room like we see the 10 in this the 10 S story and the 10 S plus
[00:13:57.800 --> 00:14:01.600]   whether they call it that or there's just two sizes of iPhone 10 now the way they're
[00:14:01.600 --> 00:14:06.720]   just two sizes of iPad Pro and there's no iPad Pro Plus which would be nice because
[00:14:06.720 --> 00:14:10.560]   simplifying Apple used to be famous for simplify simplify simplify simplify with two
[00:14:10.560 --> 00:14:14.080]   of the simplifies crossed out and we're getting a little bit complex would be nice
[00:14:14.080 --> 00:14:19.520]   to reduce but to Laurie's point Apple the the lower cost model here is in between it's
[00:14:19.520 --> 00:14:25.080]   not smaller than the iPhone 10 S it's in between the iPhone 10 S and the iPhone 10 S quote
[00:14:25.080 --> 00:14:30.680]   unquote plus and to me that's because I think in emerging markets in places like Asia in
[00:14:30.680 --> 00:14:35.320]   China even you know some places in North America people aren't buying small phones where they
[00:14:35.320 --> 00:14:40.800]   used to and they're replacing primary computing vices with phones like Andy wants to go out
[00:14:40.800 --> 00:14:45.000]   with just as iPad mini and a lot of people just want to go out with their phone and so
[00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:48.280]   they need or they have to it's the only thing they can afford that that's your only piece
[00:14:48.280 --> 00:14:53.600]   of connected technology and they just need it to be as much of a surface as possible
[00:14:53.600 --> 00:14:57.480]   and that really does beg the questions if the entire market is moving big which I think
[00:14:57.480 --> 00:15:03.720]   the Android market did years ago is is small are small phones and niches an iPhone SE
[00:15:03.720 --> 00:15:08.520]   not going to come out will come out in small order batch form in the US next year Laurie
[00:15:08.520 --> 00:15:15.360]   do you feel just left behind I do feel left behind but I don't I'm not giving up completely
[00:15:15.360 --> 00:15:20.840]   just because there's been so many SE two rumors about that it makes me think that there is
[00:15:20.840 --> 00:15:26.480]   something on the horizon it may not be what I want but it might be a continuous upgrade
[00:15:26.480 --> 00:15:34.960]   of the four inch form factor not for low cost entry level sake but for those that small
[00:15:34.960 --> 00:15:39.560]   but loud group of us who prefer the four inch form factor so I think it's going to keep
[00:15:39.560 --> 00:15:46.000]   happening I just don't think it's ever going to reach the the spec level that the premier
[00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:52.080]   phones are so I we will always feel trailed behind when it comes to whatever the new
[00:15:52.080 --> 00:15:56.200]   model is going to be I believe but it's they I don't think they're going to just sunset
[00:15:56.200 --> 00:16:01.920]   the four inch form factor completely yeah yeah and just it's always worth remembering
[00:16:01.920 --> 00:16:08.680]   that large phones are inherently sexist because who what which which slightly greater than
[00:16:08.680 --> 00:16:13.160]   50% of the population wears clothes that do not have big pockets there's your answer
[00:16:13.160 --> 00:16:17.400]   so I think it's I think it's actually important to think that probably make a smaller one
[00:16:17.400 --> 00:16:21.080]   when you go to Asia the smallest people women or men the smallest people are using the
[00:16:21.080 --> 00:16:26.280]   huge just phones like they were galaxy note adopters before I think anyone in North America
[00:16:26.280 --> 00:16:31.320]   just because they they want they were mostly wireless infrastructure they didn't go wired
[00:16:31.320 --> 00:16:35.880]   and they didn't go desktop PC and they those things became their sort of first introduction
[00:16:35.880 --> 00:16:39.760]   to PCs and they wanted the stylists and they wanted the giant screen.
[00:16:39.760 --> 00:16:44.680]   Well I think that also you're you when you don't have an iPad or some kind of tablet the
[00:16:44.680 --> 00:16:48.000]   fable it makes a lot of sense because it's going to be kind of this in between things
[00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:53.000]   so if you have it if you have that that slightly larger form factor then then you might want
[00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:56.160]   something smaller that's more compact whereas if it's the only thing you're using I know
[00:16:56.160 --> 00:17:00.520]   that people send me PDFs and I'm like oh I need to open this on my iPad or my computer
[00:17:00.520 --> 00:17:04.760]   I can't read it on my phone so there's definitely you know from from those eyes I do have to
[00:17:04.760 --> 00:17:10.360]   admit that I have an SE and I as one of my international phones and I just love being
[00:17:10.360 --> 00:17:14.920]   able to throw it my back pocket and not think about it and have it is this tiny little this
[00:17:14.920 --> 00:17:19.040]   tiny little phone I definitely miss it but I don't on a day to day basis I do like the
[00:17:19.040 --> 00:17:21.040]   slightly larger screen.
[00:17:21.040 --> 00:17:26.240]   Dalrymple throws his iPad nitty in his back pocket that's how you got to roll.
[00:17:26.240 --> 00:17:31.320]   Again that's the sexism of clothes I have my tactical pants have back pockets that can
[00:17:31.320 --> 00:17:34.600]   fit an actual full sized iPad into.
[00:17:34.600 --> 00:17:35.600]   Wow.
[00:17:35.600 --> 00:17:38.080]   Don't want to bend over too far.
[00:17:38.080 --> 00:17:41.720]   I know the problem is my wife what's hers in the inner back pocket all the time and I'm
[00:17:41.720 --> 00:17:45.240]   always like that you're going to sit down and break that phone you know like it's she's
[00:17:45.240 --> 00:17:49.280]   got the eight and so I'm always like you're gonna you're gonna break the phone you know
[00:17:49.280 --> 00:17:53.440]   like you can't and she never does but I'm always like oh I can't you know and so with
[00:17:53.440 --> 00:17:56.680]   the little SE I've never had that feeling like it's just so compact you feel like you
[00:17:56.680 --> 00:18:02.840]   can do whatever there and so with the and with the iPad kind of the you know I just my
[00:18:02.840 --> 00:18:06.720]   iPads are bigger I have the pros and so I don't you know we have some minis but they've gotten
[00:18:06.720 --> 00:18:07.720]   too slow so we don't.
[00:18:07.720 --> 00:18:12.040]   There was a picture on Twitter over the weekend of a woman who put pockets into her wedding
[00:18:12.040 --> 00:18:15.360]   dress and everyone saying how clever and how amazing it was I just kept going please don't
[00:18:15.360 --> 00:18:18.080]   make that for the phone please I hope that's not just for the phone.
[00:18:18.080 --> 00:18:19.080]   I'm sure.
[00:18:19.080 --> 00:18:25.080]   How many how are you going to put their paint they're paying $3,000 for a photographer but
[00:18:25.080 --> 00:18:28.680]   they still want to be able to take those selfies wherever they are yes.
[00:18:28.680 --> 00:18:34.840]   All right so going back to Andy's point about the less expensive phone 6.1 inches it looks
[00:18:34.840 --> 00:18:40.800]   like it's going to have a single camera and LED LCD display not an OLED display but it's
[00:18:40.800 --> 00:18:44.760]   going to be the same rumor has it it's going to be the same kind of display that LG is
[00:18:44.760 --> 00:18:50.800]   using which is a very advanced form 100% DCI DCI P3 display gamut and Apple's going to
[00:18:50.800 --> 00:18:54.760]   be able to fold it underneath the way it does OLED to make it go really all the way down
[00:18:54.760 --> 00:19:00.760]   to the bottom 2x instead of 3x so lower resolution but you know will people be able to see that
[00:19:00.760 --> 00:19:05.200]   and really care so much about it but also a lot of fun colors which is something not
[00:19:05.200 --> 00:19:09.400]   going to name any names in Occo like purple phones we've been agreeing on for a long time
[00:19:09.400 --> 00:19:14.520]   but it looks like all the fun colors are going to go on to the less expensive line again.
[00:19:14.520 --> 00:19:21.640]   Yeah that's such a it's such a cheap thing to do that makes phones so much more appealing
[00:19:21.640 --> 00:19:25.160]   as particularly when you get into the situation where people are walking into the phone stores
[00:19:25.160 --> 00:19:30.200]   and they may not necessarily be really fans or dedicated to whatever they have they just
[00:19:30.200 --> 00:19:34.280]   drop whatever it is the down sewer grade or it's three years and it's time for a new one
[00:19:34.280 --> 00:19:38.520]   and if they find they can't decide and if they were looking at three different phones that
[00:19:38.520 --> 00:19:42.360]   to them are pretty much the same phone and one of them is available in banana yellow
[00:19:42.360 --> 00:19:47.240]   they're going to buy the banana yellow one and the only difficulty that I that you can see about
[00:19:47.240 --> 00:19:51.400]   that is how do you how do you make sure there are enough banana yellow phones how do you anticipate
[00:19:51.400 --> 00:19:57.800]   the desire for banana yellow as opposed to grapey grape purple or ice blueberry blue
[00:19:58.520 --> 00:20:02.120]   yes I think that they should definitely hire the Gatorade people to come up with the names of the
[00:20:02.120 --> 00:20:07.640]   colors but yeah no that's I mean it's a it would make me switch from the iPhone to android or
[00:20:07.640 --> 00:20:12.440]   android to iPhone but I have to say that when I have a choice of the one that is this really cool
[00:20:12.440 --> 00:20:20.440]   purple color or oh good black or a different shade of black awesome I'll definitely go for a cool one
[00:20:20.440 --> 00:20:26.280]   I do think somewhere inside Apple all they think is cool is is black and a different shade of black
[00:20:26.280 --> 00:20:31.080]   and and they they do the colors for the kids you know it's kind of like a little kids get
[00:20:31.080 --> 00:20:37.400]   everything remember that there's someone just Johnny I've using colored you know a brightly colored
[00:20:37.400 --> 00:20:40.760]   phone I'm blanking on her name but there's a woman in the industrial design department whose
[00:20:40.760 --> 00:20:45.800]   only job it was for color and during an interview she came up and showed an orange apple watch cloth
[00:20:45.800 --> 00:20:53.480]   Johnny he just said no no that's fought to dorm room carpet carpentry I were gonna take a short
[00:20:53.480 --> 00:20:58.760]   break anybody oh good I was gonna say we're gonna take a short break there's so much to get to
[00:20:58.760 --> 00:21:03.960]   but Leo wanted to leave us a little something from the road I don't know if
[00:21:03.960 --> 00:21:13.000]   you cook I have by the stove I think it was answered on Anthony Bourdain I said you have to have
[00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:17.720]   this one of those squeeze bottles you know like you see him uh picnics was for catch up at muster
[00:21:17.720 --> 00:21:23.480]   but I have tres pontas olive oil and I use it all that I use olive oil so much I just want to
[00:21:23.480 --> 00:21:30.200]   always have it there for quick on a salad a quick trip for dipping bread mmm for cooking mmm
[00:21:30.200 --> 00:21:35.400]   tres pontas you know the name because we've been talking about their coffee for a long time
[00:21:35.400 --> 00:21:39.880]   actually it's they're an interesting company they started doing the coffee you know from the
[00:21:39.880 --> 00:21:43.720]   single farm in Brazil and they realized there's a market
[00:21:45.160 --> 00:21:49.720]   did you see the 60 minutes piece about Italian olive oil a couple years ago I stopped buying
[00:21:49.720 --> 00:21:55.640]   Italian olive oil because so much of it is adulterated and I was really concerned I started buying local
[00:21:55.640 --> 00:21:59.720]   olive oil it wasn't as good I mean we grow olives around here but it wasn't as good it was a little
[00:21:59.720 --> 00:22:07.640]   bitter so when the folks at tres pontas said you know we can source amazing olive oil
[00:22:09.080 --> 00:22:17.000]   from the Casa Blanca Valley in Chile which is by the way perfect for producing olives and olive oil
[00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:23.000]   would you be interested I said yes and then they sent me some this is from a single farm
[00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:29.720]   Jose Miguel Armaz's orchard in Chile it's in the Casa Blanca Valley perfect climate and this is
[00:22:29.720 --> 00:22:36.760]   extra virgin olive oil this this is this is the real deal
[00:22:36.760 --> 00:22:43.960]   and I could tell you know how you can tell look on your olive oil and look at the acidity first of
[00:22:43.960 --> 00:22:49.640]   all it should say extra virgin olive oil that means it's the first press this one's cold pressed
[00:22:49.640 --> 00:22:57.800]   that means no chemicals no heat they prioritize flavor quality aroma over yield right so a lot of
[00:22:57.800 --> 00:23:02.200]   times you'll get olive oil and they use heat or they do pressure extraction yeah you get more olive
[00:23:02.200 --> 00:23:06.680]   oil that way but it's not better olive oil this no this is cold pressed they're handpicked and
[00:23:06.680 --> 00:23:12.920]   immediately cold pressed and they use premium olives from five different varietals frontoio
[00:23:12.920 --> 00:23:22.200]   arbakina the chino coratina and arbo sauna I do know this is the most the sweetest best tasting olive oil
[00:23:22.200 --> 00:23:29.080]   I've ever had less than 0.2 percent acidity in every bottle now that's really important it's
[00:23:29.080 --> 00:23:35.080]   actually in most cases less than 0.1 but but you know the labels it pretty so just to just to make
[00:23:35.080 --> 00:23:39.720]   sure it's never more it'll never be more than 0.2 it's often less than that if you've tasted
[00:23:39.720 --> 00:23:44.600]   olive oil see I use olive oil I'm Italian I dip bread in it right so you really taste it and a
[00:23:44.600 --> 00:23:49.240]   lot of the olive oil all the olive oil we get here in northern California has a bite to it that's
[00:23:49.240 --> 00:23:57.960]   the acidity this is so delicious it's so smooth and look at the color it is green it is beautiful
[00:23:57.960 --> 00:24:04.360]   you can tell where it was grown at the at the at the farm hose Amy gels archerd if there's a QR
[00:24:04.360 --> 00:24:09.160]   code on it scan it with your phone and you'll and you'll see exactly the olive trees that this
[00:24:09.160 --> 00:24:15.400]   olive oil came from which is awesome that's a nice feeling and the other thing the price is so
[00:24:15.400 --> 00:24:20.200]   good that you know sometimes on an olive oil like this it's so good it's really dipping olive oil
[00:24:20.200 --> 00:24:26.520]   and I use for only for salads and you know eating on bread and stuff like that because it's too
[00:24:26.520 --> 00:24:31.080]   expensive this is so affordable I use it for everything why not use the best olive oil for
[00:24:31.080 --> 00:24:39.160]   everything for cooking for eating for salads it's so good you can be called extra virgin olive oil
[00:24:39.160 --> 00:24:44.680]   with acidity as high as 1 percent no this is 0.2 percent and I can tell you it makes a difference
[00:24:45.240 --> 00:24:49.640]   olive oil is good for you we all know that the FDA says eating two tablespoons of olive oil
[00:24:49.640 --> 00:24:54.440]   that they may reduce the risk of heart disease that's that Mediterranean diet they all talk about
[00:24:54.440 --> 00:25:04.760]   omega-3 omega-6 fatty acids I don't use any other oil for cooking even for making popcorn I use
[00:25:04.760 --> 00:25:10.520]   because it's so affordable why not trace upon to us extra virgin olive oil I'm telling you you've
[00:25:10.520 --> 00:25:14.760]   got to taste this now you could just buy a single bottle if you don't trust me on Amazon they saw
[00:25:14.760 --> 00:25:20.680]   it on Amazon but once you want it once you know you want it I subscribe just like the coffee Trace

[00:26:54.680 --> 00:27:00.440]   Erica to tell us about Tres Pontas so they'll be really hungry for the rest of this show all
[00:27:00.440 --> 00:27:05.080]   right so iPhone I think the last thing to talk about with the iPhone and Andy has alluded to this
[00:27:05.080 --> 00:27:11.800]   on past shows is the camera it's always a big deal rumor has it this year it might be an especially
[00:27:11.800 --> 00:27:17.400]   big deal because we might finally be getting a lot of the stuff that we saw demoed in the messages
[00:27:17.400 --> 00:27:22.680]   app and the FaceTime app that we've been using on the front facing camera in the rear facing camera
[00:27:22.680 --> 00:27:27.720]   and you touched on AR before Andy but it seems like every time I'm wondering what can Apple do
[00:27:27.720 --> 00:27:31.560]   next we got portrait mode and we got portrait lighting and I was like oh for sure portrait
[00:27:31.560 --> 00:27:35.640]   backgrounds are next but then they did that in the clip-sap at the same time as portrait lighting
[00:27:35.640 --> 00:27:40.360]   and I want things I want like portrait mode video for example but it seems like we really are in
[00:27:40.360 --> 00:27:47.480]   the dawn of AR cameras yeah it's especially especially given that their main competitor is
[00:27:47.480 --> 00:27:53.880]   Google that has gone so far as to say that our company is a machine learning company so when they
[00:27:53.880 --> 00:27:59.400]   so now when they try to promote the camera and their their new pixel phones they don't necessarily
[00:27:59.400 --> 00:28:04.360]   talk about the image sensor or the lens or what kind of coding is on the lens they talk about how
[00:28:04.360 --> 00:28:09.160]   good the software that they've got on the camera is at figuring out the picture that you were hoping
[00:28:09.160 --> 00:28:13.960]   to take versus the picture that that sensor was capable of taking and faking it to such a great
[00:28:13.960 --> 00:28:20.600]   extent when I got my pixel phone a year or two ago I it's fast enough that I just keep it in the
[00:28:20.600 --> 00:28:26.280]   it has a mode called HDR plus that is just so good and so natural that it doesn't look like HDR at
[00:28:26.280 --> 00:28:32.520]   all it just looks like I'm taking it with a much better much better camera so it's it's it's
[00:28:32.520 --> 00:28:38.120]   harder and harder to sell a phone camera based on the hardware you're putting in given that
[00:28:38.120 --> 00:28:43.720]   desktop software and even mobile software can do things like figure out just recognize that
[00:28:43.720 --> 00:28:49.000]   this is a face this is what people like to see in pictures of faces they want the eyes if the
[00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:53.160]   eyes are in deep shadow they want it brightened a little bit so you can at least see where the eyes
[00:28:53.160 --> 00:28:58.200]   are they want to know what the they want a natural skin tone not only that but they want
[00:28:58.200 --> 00:29:05.080]   natural skin tone for their own natural personal skin tone not just for white people the white
[00:29:05.080 --> 00:29:10.840]   engineers who created probably created this hardware and created the software so the proof is going
[00:29:10.840 --> 00:29:15.000]   to be in the pudding that I think this is one of the reasons why apple has had so much success with
[00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:20.600]   things like portrait lighting it's a way to get a really positive useful dramatic feature that
[00:29:20.600 --> 00:29:26.040]   people are going to love without necessarily having to make millions and millions of dollars of
[00:29:26.040 --> 00:29:31.560]   investment in tech and in first order technology they can it's it's one way again one way of giving
[00:29:31.560 --> 00:29:36.680]   people a photo that they love is to once again try to make it look as natural and wonderful as
[00:29:36.680 --> 00:29:40.520]   possible another way is just simply coming up with better and better ways to blur out the
[00:29:40.520 --> 00:29:45.000]   background and isolate the foreground I think that's what apple's going to try to do I think
[00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:51.320]   Alex just wants a tango style scanner on the back finally a bunch of lasers you know the tank
[00:29:51.320 --> 00:29:56.840]   I thought tango was amazing no we did a lot of testing with tango and there were a lot of really
[00:29:56.840 --> 00:30:00.760]   successful things the problem really we had with tango was a nobody had it so you couldn't build
[00:30:00.760 --> 00:30:06.200]   anything for it except for internal and number two was that it burned up the battery very very fast
[00:30:06.200 --> 00:30:11.320]   so that was the the downfall and that could be still the challenge with a camera on the
[00:30:11.320 --> 00:30:16.520]   a laser style camera on the other side because it's you know it's easy to make something that can
[00:30:16.520 --> 00:30:21.480]   see a couple you know a foot or two but it's a whole different thing as far as accuracy goes
[00:30:21.480 --> 00:30:28.600]   because when you think about the way it scans the further you get away the samples actually get
[00:30:28.600 --> 00:30:35.800]   further part two so so it's so that that issue you know you still could get an amazing amount of
[00:30:35.800 --> 00:30:39.720]   data you know from from an area but it definitely is much harder to make it work well
[00:30:39.720 --> 00:30:44.680]   yeah more than a couple feet and so I think that that's going to be the challenge now if you're
[00:30:44.680 --> 00:30:49.160]   just taking pictures of your friends right across that's fine and it will give you a lot more data
[00:30:49.160 --> 00:30:53.560]   but I think that apple is figuring out slowly how to use the cameras that they have there to be
[00:30:53.560 --> 00:30:59.400]   fairly effective at grabbing that data from from where you're at so especially you'll see you'll
[00:30:59.400 --> 00:31:03.160]   watch a lot of those demos and you will see people kind of liberally moving the phone around that's not
[00:31:03.160 --> 00:31:07.720]   that doesn't make it harder that actually makes it easier so as the camera if the camera stays in
[00:31:07.720 --> 00:31:11.960]   one place and doesn't move at all there's no parallax and it's really hard to figure out what the 3d
[00:31:11.960 --> 00:31:17.240]   scene looks like as soon as you start to move that camera around in the scene it starts to track
[00:31:17.240 --> 00:31:21.960]   those points and this is all stuff that we talked about years ago which is that they're using a lot
[00:31:21.960 --> 00:31:27.960]   of old technologies of match moving and you know those types of things what they're basically doing
[00:31:27.960 --> 00:31:32.520]   is grabbing when you want to think about how these cameras are working with these lenses is I'm
[00:31:32.520 --> 00:31:37.400]   going to grab a bunch of points out there some some points of interest you know just something that
[00:31:37.400 --> 00:31:43.800]   looks that I can any image that I can grab onto and I'll just grab as many as I can the next frame
[00:31:43.800 --> 00:31:48.440]   I'm going to grab I'm going to see which ones I still think are the same ones and so frame to
[00:31:48.440 --> 00:31:51.800]   frame to frame I'm going to track all those 2d points and then I'm going to look at how those
[00:31:51.800 --> 00:31:58.200]   those points that I have a lot of confidence in how they're changing amongst themselves and that
[00:31:58.200 --> 00:32:02.840]   tells me that gives me an idea where the camera is and the great thing that apple has or that
[00:32:02.840 --> 00:32:07.480]   any phone has is that the lens doesn't change when we do it with with the film cameras we have to
[00:32:07.480 --> 00:32:12.520]   figure out the whole you know what lens are they using what's the distortion and and what's the zoom
[00:32:12.520 --> 00:32:17.560]   and what's the you know the chromatic aberration and all the other things that occur when we're
[00:32:17.560 --> 00:32:23.000]   trying to track that that that piece whereas with with both google and apple you know what that is
[00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:29.800]   you built 75 million so so the they're all the same so so that and and and again that changing that
[00:32:29.800 --> 00:32:34.440]   and and so it's it's a really great advantage that they have and so once they're able to start
[00:32:34.440 --> 00:32:39.160]   moving that around they can do a lot of that data a lot of those calculations without the laser
[00:32:39.160 --> 00:32:46.200]   the I think that one of the things that we are going to see missing is a available data set
[00:32:46.200 --> 00:32:50.440]   within a lot of these locations and so you know what they want to do is tell you how easy it is
[00:32:50.440 --> 00:32:53.880]   you can have persistence and you can leave something but what they really need what would
[00:32:53.880 --> 00:32:57.320]   really make things better we'll just say that someone's going to get into this as a business
[00:32:57.320 --> 00:33:04.440]   you won't be me but that you know gathering really high quality
[00:33:04.440 --> 00:33:10.840]   searchable data you know hashable data that that you don't have to get you don't have to deal with
[00:33:10.840 --> 00:33:15.800]   all the data but you have a lot of data to grab onto i'm really having accurate data that that
[00:33:15.800 --> 00:33:22.520]   does that that's available to developers is going to be something that's that's an emerging market
[00:33:22.520 --> 00:33:26.760]   you know that's that's something that people are going to need need in the not too distant future
[00:33:26.760 --> 00:33:30.120]   because yeah the cameras can kind of grab onto what they have and they can kind of look at their
[00:33:30.120 --> 00:33:35.480]   GPS but they they'd be a lot more fun if they really knew what they were looking at so lori last
[00:33:35.480 --> 00:33:38.600]   year i was at the iphone launch you know and there were people in line and they were buying
[00:33:38.600 --> 00:33:42.920]   this super expensive iphone and i asked them why are you upgrading and they said well you know the
[00:33:42.920 --> 00:33:48.120]   cost is kind of incidental because i subscribe i pay t-mobile or whoever monthly but i have kids
[00:33:48.120 --> 00:33:52.840]   and i can never go back in time and take a better photo of my kids where i always want to make sure
[00:33:52.840 --> 00:33:57.880]   i have the best camera possible but i'm wondering how far does that go are these cameras good enough
[00:33:57.880 --> 00:34:02.200]   now or do you still see people complaining that you know pictures of their kids of concerts of
[00:34:02.200 --> 00:34:07.400]   Disneyland maybe something close you know near and dear to you it'd still be better i was actually
[00:34:07.400 --> 00:34:12.200]   talking to a friend of mine about this who brought his dsr camera with him to a trip to
[00:34:12.760 --> 00:34:18.840]   Japan that he took recently and he was talking about how that camera was really heavy and he was
[00:34:18.840 --> 00:34:24.120]   considering upgrading to the latest iphone and i was just kind of generally talking about how
[00:34:24.120 --> 00:34:30.280]   right now the iphone 10 camera the iphone a plus camera and the software features that go along
[00:34:30.280 --> 00:34:35.560]   with them they've they really kind of have hit i mean there's going to be something better out
[00:34:35.560 --> 00:34:40.200]   there some something better technologically out there but we've kind of hit that point where
[00:34:40.840 --> 00:34:45.480]   our phone cameras are almost as good as and in some cases better than
[00:34:45.480 --> 00:34:52.520]   you know our analog digital film cameras and i'm not saying that they're going to be that good
[00:34:52.520 --> 00:34:57.640]   but what i mean is that you can with the iphone 10 for example take those perfect shots of your
[00:34:57.640 --> 00:35:02.600]   kid with the beautiful bouquet effect in the background and it's clear and crisp and it has
[00:35:02.600 --> 00:35:07.640]   the right lighting you can take them fast the way you would with a point and shoot camera which
[00:35:07.640 --> 00:35:12.280]   is something that isn't as easy to easily accessible with the larger dsr cameras so
[00:35:12.280 --> 00:35:15.560]   yeah in in a way we've kind of hit that point where
[00:35:15.560 --> 00:35:23.800]   the the average everyday person can take professional looking photographs just using their their phone
[00:35:23.800 --> 00:35:29.480]   and i i don't know how much better the camera needs to get them where it's at now
[00:35:29.480 --> 00:35:35.480]   well i i think that uh i i think that one of the interesting things is that we got to a point
[00:35:35.480 --> 00:35:40.680]   it we're kind of in this i i i was thinking about this the other day with that we're kind of going
[00:35:40.680 --> 00:35:45.720]   through this back and forth because for a long time slrs and these big cameras were only there
[00:35:45.720 --> 00:35:51.000]   for professionals and then they got so cheap and so powerful that you just kind of always told
[00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:54.920]   everybody well everybody should you should always have an sl you know you should get a dsr because
[00:35:54.920 --> 00:36:00.120]   because it's just so easy and you're gonna the picture is gonna look so much better and now i
[00:36:00.120 --> 00:36:03.880]   would say that i would almost lean to the point where i would say that the i do think that there's
[00:36:03.880 --> 00:36:10.200]   a reason to have an slr i i i i look at photos that that i shoot with the dsr and they are better
[00:36:10.200 --> 00:36:14.600]   significantly i can see that i don't know if they i mean you know and i have zoom i can you know i've
[00:36:14.600 --> 00:36:19.560]   got a you know a 300 millimeter lens i can throw away in there and and get this great photo and it's
[00:36:19.560 --> 00:36:23.800]   you know and it just it definitely is a higher quality it's better resolution it's all those
[00:36:23.800 --> 00:36:28.200]   things and so i i do think there's a place for that but i think that for the most part
[00:36:28.680 --> 00:36:38.440]   uh the quality of an iphone eight you know and above i would say has passed the uh the skill set
[00:36:38.440 --> 00:36:44.440]   of the average parent um you know and what i mean by that is you know it's not the it's not the it's
[00:36:44.440 --> 00:36:48.360]   not the tool at some point you you really have to learn how to frame it i know when i went to
[00:36:48.360 --> 00:36:53.240]   when i go to my my friends um you know my kids friends they all go to chucky cheese you know they
[00:36:53.240 --> 00:36:57.000]   love chucky cheese and so and my kids are old a little older now they don't they don't go as much
[00:36:57.000 --> 00:37:00.520]   but at a certain age they were all going to chucky cheese it was like we were there like every three
[00:37:00.520 --> 00:37:05.480]   weeks and um and their parents would bring an s l r and i'd watch them shooting it and i just
[00:37:05.480 --> 00:37:09.640]   knew that those photos weren't gonna turn out well and so i'd always go hey what kind of camera do
[00:37:09.640 --> 00:37:12.760]   you got oh that's really cool do you think i could borrow that for a second or do you just see how
[00:37:12.760 --> 00:37:17.640]   it works i'm just always looking at cameras and um and then i would take all the photos for their
[00:37:17.640 --> 00:37:20.520]   thing and then i'd hand it back to them you know like that's a really great photo so then they have
[00:37:20.520 --> 00:37:24.840]   at least a handful of photos that are really nice that's why i don't tell alli's got so many
[00:37:24.840 --> 00:37:30.040]   invitations yeah yeah but the thing is is that it was it was the and my sister does that by the way
[00:37:30.040 --> 00:37:35.720]   my sister does that too to me so anyway so um you know so and the distance between the the
[00:37:35.720 --> 00:37:41.640]   somewhat apparent and me is the same distance between me and my sister and so so the um uh but the
[00:37:41.640 --> 00:37:48.200]   the interesting thing there is that uh i think that for the most part now having that camera with
[00:37:48.200 --> 00:37:51.960]   you all the time i think the average person my my wife now takes pictures with her with her
[00:37:51.960 --> 00:37:56.520]   iPhone 8 and she's you know they look great i mean you know they're great photos of the kids and
[00:37:56.520 --> 00:38:01.080]   great photos of stuff she's shooting and i think that that is um much better than carrying you know
[00:38:01.080 --> 00:38:05.000]   not carrying it around or not having there all the time i do think that if you have there are a
[00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:09.800]   lot of specific uses that make sense to still have a have a really high end camera uh underwater
[00:38:09.800 --> 00:38:15.560]   rugged um as well as being able to you know if you really know what to do with those lenses i think
[00:38:15.560 --> 00:38:20.200]   that the professional area now that we're going to mirrorless it with can and icon most likely
[00:38:21.160 --> 00:38:27.560]   um uh you know the i think that that race is going to get a lot more intense and we're going to see
[00:38:27.560 --> 00:38:31.800]   you know more features uh with all those cameras as well because they're they have to fight now
[00:38:31.800 --> 00:38:35.960]   for a smaller and smaller island because a lot of people aren't fine you know an extra camera
[00:38:35.960 --> 00:38:41.160]   right because if you if you're if you're kind of you're presenting that moment in time where you
[00:38:41.160 --> 00:38:47.000]   are going to buy a new camera and you're looking at a thousand dollar DSLR and that's not including
[00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:51.800]   lenses that you have to buy or you're talking about a thousand dollar iPhone that is going to take
[00:38:51.800 --> 00:38:57.480]   really great pictures too there's that decision you have to make and frankly the iPhone 10 satisfies
[00:38:57.480 --> 00:39:01.960]   most of that and i agree with you that there's a lot of reasons why you should have an SLR but
[00:39:01.960 --> 00:39:08.600]   when you're making those decisions the quality of the hardware and software that comes with
[00:39:08.600 --> 00:39:14.280]   the iPhone 10 and and other other cameras that aren't apple related to it's just the technology
[00:39:14.280 --> 00:39:20.520]   has gotten to that point where you can actually have those two options and then choose the the phone
[00:39:20.520 --> 00:39:25.320]   because it really is good enough for what you're going to need for most cases and then we would
[00:39:25.320 --> 00:39:30.600]   have the extra money by the the SLR camera yeah exactly if you have the extra money i would say
[00:39:30.600 --> 00:39:34.840]   that that having that phone having that extra phone at the house maybe you don't take it everywhere
[00:39:34.840 --> 00:39:37.880]   you know maybe the phone status you don't carry it around as much as you used to but
[00:39:37.880 --> 00:39:43.480]   you should take pictures if you're if you're a parent you should try to take pictures with an SLR
[00:39:43.480 --> 00:39:48.280]   of your kids at least once a month just just that just find some some solution that causes
[00:39:48.280 --> 00:39:52.600]   that because those are always i look back on these photos i did there was a kind of a gap where i
[00:39:52.600 --> 00:39:58.600]   broke a camera and a lens and i didn't um in the desert and and i didn't replace it quickly and i
[00:39:58.600 --> 00:40:04.280]   just shot a lot with iPhones and there's a section of time with my kids that it doesn't look as good
[00:40:04.280 --> 00:40:10.440]   you know though you know as as it does when i'm shooting with the SLR so in other words you have
[00:40:10.440 --> 00:40:14.280]   cameras that you're willing to sell to those parents who need a new camera
[00:40:14.280 --> 00:40:25.400]   cameras yeah well lori lori is absolutely right um which i i'm a photo nut and so i'm the person
[00:40:25.400 --> 00:40:29.880]   who says oh a little bit of purple fringing around that high oh there's an that too bad
[00:40:29.880 --> 00:40:34.520]   but the thing is most people just want to take snapshots they want to take good pictures and so
[00:40:34.520 --> 00:40:38.360]   there's comes a there i think there there has there came a point about a couple years ago where
[00:40:39.400 --> 00:40:45.160]   yes if you want to do an exhaustive test with a test card take the exact same pictures under
[00:40:45.160 --> 00:40:50.680]   the exact same lighting conditions and then magnify magnify magnify to see which one captured more
[00:40:50.680 --> 00:40:56.040]   detail which one captured a more range of tone you could determine that something is a better camera
[00:40:56.040 --> 00:41:03.000]   than the other one but it's way beyond now the people's expectations for camera it's it's uh the
[00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:07.960]   people people take pictures with their phones instead of with a five hundred dollar camera because
[00:41:07.960 --> 00:41:13.560]   it's it's plenty good enough for them and that does point to uh they the challenge that apple and
[00:41:13.560 --> 00:41:17.560]   other manufacturers have if they want to keep saying that they have the best camera out there
[00:41:17.560 --> 00:41:23.560]   it's not necessarily if either you have to qualify that as the best camera for consumers so again they
[00:41:23.560 --> 00:41:29.960]   want to they want a party shot where in a in a in a dimly lit function room or bar where it doesn't
[00:41:29.960 --> 00:41:35.480]   look like washed out faces in front of jet black background uh they want natural they they want to
[00:41:35.480 --> 00:41:41.240]   make sure that uh eyes twinkle and sparkle uh so this is the it's it's these extra really really
[00:41:41.240 --> 00:41:46.920]   cool and human-oriented modes that i think will keep pushing apple above the rest and you know i
[00:41:46.920 --> 00:41:52.040]   have i have we just we just printed a bunch of photos that i shot with my iphone that i have on the wall
[00:41:52.040 --> 00:41:56.520]   in in our studio in our green room and i look at them and i'm like i can't believe i just shot
[00:41:56.520 --> 00:41:59.960]   those with a phone yeah you know like i just they're not all with a phone but a lot of them are just
[00:41:59.960 --> 00:42:03.720]   like i just shot it with a phone and it was just like what what i had you know what i had sitting there
[00:42:03.720 --> 00:42:08.680]   and it's just it they're kind of it's kind of amazing and and i think the issue that a lot of these
[00:42:08.680 --> 00:42:13.240]   camera manufacturers have is that apple and google have are applying a lot more money to that
[00:42:13.240 --> 00:42:17.080]   technology i mean they just have you know because they're they're dealing with a much larger scale
[00:42:17.080 --> 00:42:24.040]   can i say that i just i just entered my first uh a juried photo exhibition for the very first time
[00:42:24.040 --> 00:42:31.160]   and uh one of the pictures that i submitted was taken through the window of a train with an iphone
[00:42:31.160 --> 00:42:37.720]   10 and the great the great thing about google photos or apple photos is that it's very
[00:42:37.720 --> 00:42:42.760]   democratizing you just look at the image it doesn't say hey you didn't take that with a real camera
[00:42:42.760 --> 00:42:47.560]   you took that with a phone but oh my god it's just such a beautiful picture and every technical
[00:42:47.560 --> 00:42:53.960]   thing i would want from my my two thousand dollar camera it did just fine for that shot so yeah
[00:42:53.960 --> 00:43:00.280]   there's things that these are different and now i'm not exactly i'm not gonna tell the jury that i'm
[00:43:00.280 --> 00:43:07.240]   just gonna say that all right so moving from phones moving from pockets to risk the other big
[00:43:07.240 --> 00:43:12.440]   leak that nine to five mac got not leaks wrong where the the other bit of something they found
[00:43:12.440 --> 00:43:18.600]   the other empty managed to find somewhere on the interwebs is of an apple watch series four unlike
[00:43:18.600 --> 00:43:24.360]   the iphone i don't i don't think that name was ever in doubt and uh thankfully it's got the same
[00:43:24.360 --> 00:43:28.520]   band as every other apple watch so you're not gonna find me lying in a state of learned helplessness
[00:43:28.520 --> 00:43:35.960]   sobbing in the fetal position anytime soon but it does show the rumored uh in big end display the
[00:43:35.960 --> 00:43:41.240]   the bezels have been removed the black ring is finally being closed uh and everything is moved
[00:43:41.240 --> 00:43:45.640]   out towards the edges but i think the biggest thing there's a lot of little details like a ring
[00:43:45.640 --> 00:43:51.000]   instead of a red dot an extra microphone on the side some people are saying it looks thinner but i
[00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:57.880]   think that's hard to tell given sensor side but my god it is glorious the the application of Edward
[00:43:57.880 --> 00:44:03.880]   tufties informational density to this display with what i'm calling super complications
[00:44:03.880 --> 00:44:09.400]   is just is is breathtaking i mean it might be too much in actual practice this might be
[00:44:09.400 --> 00:44:17.160]   overload for me but in terms of pure data visualization this is and he like it's just it's beyond impressive
[00:44:17.160 --> 00:44:22.840]   to me it shows not just glanceable data but glanceable context unlike a thing that i can wear on my
[00:44:22.840 --> 00:44:28.920]   wrist yeah absolutely i mean it's such a far cry and such a such a really nice leap from those
[00:44:28.920 --> 00:44:34.440]   first demos we saw four years ago where look look how easy it is to press this button and now you
[00:44:34.440 --> 00:44:39.640]   see a constellation of app icons any of which you can scroll through and tap into to use these
[00:44:39.640 --> 00:44:45.080]   wonderful little phone apps uh i think uh it it does look cluttered for to by a certain point of
[00:44:45.080 --> 00:44:49.080]   view it probably won't be the only one guessing it's not the only watch face you can have on there
[00:44:49.080 --> 00:44:54.360]   but the great that is the i think that the the companies and the designers who really get what
[00:44:54.360 --> 00:45:00.440]   a wearable is all about it really is about this gesture glancing to get that one piece of information
[00:45:00.440 --> 00:45:05.320]   you did this to get and then putting your hand back down again and so the ability to what really
[00:45:05.320 --> 00:45:11.320]   sold me uh after about that screenshot was the timer in the upper that's the timer complications
[00:45:11.320 --> 00:45:15.240]   home putting the upper left hand corner where i i know that i've i know that i've got the
[00:45:16.040 --> 00:45:20.280]   i've got dinner in the sous vide i know this is going to take about an hour and 45 minutes to cook
[00:45:20.280 --> 00:45:24.840]   it's not the sort of thing where i wanted to dominate my wrist but i want to know do i have
[00:45:24.840 --> 00:45:31.800]   time to go out for a walk and come back now glance and you got it so uh it's uh i'm i'm keen to see
[00:45:31.800 --> 00:45:37.800]   how that will affect app design to see if we wind up with a couple different classes of uh of apps
[00:45:37.800 --> 00:45:43.560]   and users i'm really curious to see if they manage to pack all those extra pixels also in the smaller
[00:45:43.560 --> 00:45:48.520]   version of the watch as well as the larger one so everybody gets that benefit and i'm also going
[00:45:48.520 --> 00:45:53.560]   to say please please thank you for the extra pixels but let developers design their own watch
[00:45:53.560 --> 00:45:59.400]   faces they're really good at design but yeah it's it's nothing but a really good based on one
[00:45:59.400 --> 00:46:06.360]   one illicit screen uh press image i like that that is a really really good thing for me to see i like
[00:46:06.360 --> 00:46:11.640]   it i have to explain something to lori gill because the thing on the top right hand side there lori
[00:46:11.640 --> 00:46:16.840]   that's a high and low temperature for paces places that have climates where you actually do have
[00:46:16.840 --> 00:46:22.120]   cold weather and hot weather sometime during the same day you mean it's not yellow all the time
[00:46:22.120 --> 00:46:27.800]   no it's not yellow it can get hot or it can get cold nice comfortable yellow all day long all
[00:46:27.800 --> 00:46:34.280]   night long no yeah you're you're you're a place with air quality if you'd like yeah that might be
[00:46:34.280 --> 00:46:39.400]   something i would i would need instead i can't say that my i'm still the only feature that i want
[00:46:39.400 --> 00:46:43.000]   on the watch i don't care about what they do i don't care how thick it is i don't care how big it is i
[00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:47.240]   just want to be able to design my own watch face like it's now gotten to the point where now every
[00:46:47.240 --> 00:46:51.480]   time apple talks about the watch the only the filter that it's going through like i'm not like
[00:46:51.480 --> 00:46:56.600]   i'm just like la la la la like they're just static just static until and then and then wait i'm waiting
[00:46:56.600 --> 00:47:01.880]   for them to say and now we're always on time on a basis sorry Alex is it that or all because i
[00:47:01.880 --> 00:47:05.640]   everything on a watch everything in mobile is paid for by battery life if you make it thinner you're
[00:47:05.640 --> 00:47:09.560]   paying for that in battery life if you add a bigger screen or more complications or more
[00:47:09.560 --> 00:47:14.200]   features i don't see i would like them to spend it on always on display before they get into custom
[00:47:14.200 --> 00:47:19.240]   watch faces yeah that's my big thing is is that i there's there's like for production reasons i
[00:47:19.240 --> 00:47:23.240]   admit and i think there's a lot of people who have specific things that they haven't thought of with
[00:47:23.240 --> 00:47:28.200]   the the 10 white watch faces that we get that that would love to be able to use it in a specific
[00:47:28.200 --> 00:47:32.680]   way and i think i posted mine on twitter at some point like i designed one like that's what i want
[00:47:32.680 --> 00:47:39.400]   you know and if apple gave me that one then i wouldn't care so but but i think but i think that
[00:47:39.400 --> 00:47:46.280]   there's a lot of industries that that would love to be able to say for what we do this these are
[00:47:46.280 --> 00:47:49.720]   the complications that we want and this is how we want it to be organized because that's you know
[00:47:49.720 --> 00:47:54.200]   whether you're in construction or medical or or you know there's there's certain things that you
[00:47:54.200 --> 00:47:58.280]   want to have there and i think there's a huge opportunity to develop those and i get that it may
[00:47:58.280 --> 00:48:01.560]   affect the battery life and maybe that's why they're doing it but i think we can we can set some
[00:48:01.560 --> 00:48:04.360]   limits we you could set some bars and then we can tell you you know you're gonna you're
[00:48:04.360 --> 00:48:08.120]   about to do this and you may have shorter battery life but the point is is that
[00:48:08.120 --> 00:48:13.240]   you know it just like that's the one thing that i always go oh android you can just build your own
[00:48:13.240 --> 00:48:18.120]   you can just make your own watch faces for me would be enough that they just put
[00:48:18.120 --> 00:48:23.720]   complications on the photo face because all i want is an old school like original era superman like
[00:48:23.720 --> 00:48:28.920]   from action comics number one with complications i just i just want seconds and not that stupid
[00:48:28.920 --> 00:48:33.160]   exercise one with a little like everyone every time i say this on the show i get a whole bunch
[00:48:33.160 --> 00:48:36.200]   of people on twitter going they already have seconds you can and they send me the watch face
[00:48:36.200 --> 00:48:39.800]   and i'm like i would never put that watch face i would never talk to someone in public with that
[00:48:39.800 --> 00:48:46.200]   watch face on so so i would you know like that that's just goofy so so i uh i just want a really subtle
[00:48:46.200 --> 00:48:51.960]   one that gives you seconds you know and uh and uh anyway it's just production or is it
[00:48:51.960 --> 00:48:57.960]   the idea of being able to have a watch face kit so apple can have their guidelines
[00:48:57.960 --> 00:49:05.400]   that help restrict how much battery it's using and developers can then use this watch face kit
[00:49:05.400 --> 00:49:13.240]   to develop these watch faces that don't mess with your watch and and like do you trust you know
[00:49:13.240 --> 00:49:18.680]   you trust the developer community to make apps and uh for your for your phones and for your watches
[00:49:18.680 --> 00:49:22.760]   and for your mac why don't you trust them to make these watch faces if you've given them the
[00:49:22.760 --> 00:49:27.560]   guidelines that they have to adhere to why not give that to developers so that they can create
[00:49:27.560 --> 00:49:32.840]   beautiful watch faces that we can choose from a beautiful watch face store that would be so cool
[00:49:32.840 --> 00:49:37.240]   to be able to do that yeah it's probably the same reason they don't give you ui kit apps yet they
[00:49:37.240 --> 00:49:41.960]   just have to do it i'm wondering though lory like are these complex i count nine complicate if you
[00:49:41.960 --> 00:49:46.520]   don't you don't include the second the minute and the hour hand i count nine complications here you
[00:49:46.520 --> 00:49:50.440]   have the four in the corners you have the four in the middle and then you have the 12 p.m.
[00:49:50.440 --> 00:49:54.920]   lunch with ken tartine who's a popular dude by the way right on the top and i don't know if that
[00:49:54.920 --> 00:49:58.440]   goes to the bottom if it's a six p.m. lunch because that would be kind of cool i don't know any of
[00:49:58.440 --> 00:50:04.840]   these things yet but that's a lot of information to take in as a glance yeah i mean yeah there's
[00:50:04.840 --> 00:50:11.080]   something obviously and you don't have to use that complication but there is something to be said for
[00:50:11.640 --> 00:50:17.640]   it that's that's a little busy i think if it were if i were using i wouldn't have that many on my
[00:50:17.640 --> 00:50:22.680]   watch face because at a glance i wouldn't be able to read all of the information i want i would
[00:50:22.680 --> 00:50:30.280]   probably take out a lot of those things inside the watch face the the music controls the ring
[00:50:30.280 --> 00:50:36.680]   closures whatever the planet earth is planet earth maybe that has to do with like the when the when
[00:50:36.680 --> 00:50:41.640]   the sun rises and sets or something like that i would clear it out a little everything on the
[00:50:41.640 --> 00:50:47.240]   corners i think is really great really easy to see it's colorful so that it gives you your eyes
[00:50:47.240 --> 00:50:55.640]   are drawn to it and that's that's great the lunch with ken section that's a little busy hard to see
[00:50:55.640 --> 00:51:00.680]   but then again i'm used to looking at my watch face which is significantly smaller because of
[00:51:00.680 --> 00:51:07.320]   the bezel situation so maybe when that's spread out across the entire watch face maybe that becomes
[00:51:07.320 --> 00:51:12.360]   a lot easier to see again we won't know until we're looking at him with our very own eyes and
[00:51:12.360 --> 00:51:19.560]   instead of just one uh found marketing photo yeah and also that that's that's well that's well
[00:51:19.560 --> 00:51:24.520]   within the tradition of uh of watch faces so since time immemorial i don't i'm not wearing my my my
[00:51:24.520 --> 00:51:31.160]   jeep my casio g shock watch but it has the time it has the date it has uh another panel for
[00:51:31.160 --> 00:51:35.640]   bluetooth notifications and it's got to be up that's that that's fine that's that's uh the
[00:51:35.640 --> 00:51:39.800]   i think a lot of people actually will like that kind of style because it gets well within the
[00:51:39.800 --> 00:51:45.240]   tradition of nice watches it's a dashboard so my last question before we jump back to to leo on his
[00:51:45.240 --> 00:51:51.000]   italian adventure is do they keep a series one around that an even lower introductory price
[00:51:51.000 --> 00:51:56.040]   do they get rid of series one and go to series two at the same price series one currently is or
[00:51:56.040 --> 00:52:00.760]   do they go all the way to series three is the entry level and get lte out on more risks for more
[00:52:00.760 --> 00:52:08.040]   people what do you think the play is there they have to keep the lowest price point there um i i
[00:52:08.040 --> 00:52:13.320]   understood i was reading i've been looking for it right now it's got it's all it was it was in my
[00:52:13.320 --> 00:52:18.680]   list of things i read online but i need to check the details of uh someone was claiming that the
[00:52:18.680 --> 00:52:23.560]   series one is actually at apple's best-selling apple watch uh don't know if that's true
[00:52:23.560 --> 00:52:30.680]   it's uh i think that uh given yeah given given that they're competing not as they hoped with
[00:52:30.680 --> 00:52:36.120]   two thousand dollar high-end time pieces they are actually competing with a hundred dollar and
[00:52:36.120 --> 00:52:41.000]   hundred fifty dollar and two hundred dollar fitness watches uh people they need to have that that
[00:52:41.000 --> 00:52:46.120]   two hundred fifty dollar buy-in uh that's that that's what makes the entire rest of the line super
[00:52:46.120 --> 00:52:49.640]   credible because that's right people will buy people buy the two hundred fifty one as those
[00:52:49.640 --> 00:52:54.520]   fitness watch and then when there's a new one that when they decide that why i really love this watch
[00:52:54.520 --> 00:52:59.560]   i'd love to get the one with with gps and the in the walkie talkie feature and you know what maybe
[00:52:59.560 --> 00:53:03.320]   i will get the stainless steel model this time because i love it so much and i why word every day
[00:53:03.320 --> 00:53:09.320]   and i haven't said it's a couple of years it took a couple of years just to get to the phone to get
[00:53:09.320 --> 00:53:18.840]   the phone to have multiple sizes therefore multiple options to to invest i don't think they're ready
[00:53:18.840 --> 00:53:25.080]   with the watch to give us the low cost entry level watch i think they're still gonna stick with the
[00:53:25.080 --> 00:53:30.840]   this is the price and these are the options and instead of the you know five years old version
[00:53:30.840 --> 00:53:37.000]   that you could get i think they're gonna just kind of say nope you can get series series four and
[00:53:37.000 --> 00:53:42.280]   that's it or you can buy third party and get get an older one i i don't think they're ready to give
[00:53:42.280 --> 00:53:46.280]   us no i think they're gonna keep the series one around or replace a series one with the two i
[00:53:46.280 --> 00:53:51.400]   don't think so i i don't think they're ready and i i think they're gonna keep pushing by the newest
[00:53:51.400 --> 00:53:56.280]   one by the newest one by the newest one and then in a couple years they'll bring in the older
[00:53:56.280 --> 00:54:01.400]   that they'll keep they'll keep around an older model that you can use i think they'll keep two i
[00:54:01.400 --> 00:54:05.720]   don't think they're ready to go to three like i i would love it if they kept the series one or the
[00:54:05.720 --> 00:54:10.840]   series two around even cheaper than it is now to get even more people in and replace the current
[00:54:10.840 --> 00:54:15.320]   series one price point with a two or three i just don't know if we'll see that but i do think they'll
[00:54:15.320 --> 00:54:20.760]   replace the series one with a two or three hopefully i think that's good i mean i think the biggest
[00:54:20.760 --> 00:54:24.920]   jump that they've had between watches in my opinion from a real usability perspective has been
[00:54:24.920 --> 00:54:30.200]   the battery life you know the battery life has gotten better i think from watch to watch i definitely
[00:54:30.200 --> 00:54:34.520]   feel like the three is much better than the previous ones and so that's the biggest argument i have
[00:54:34.520 --> 00:54:38.360]   to say i don't really use any features that i don't use any features on my current watch
[00:54:38.360 --> 00:54:44.120]   that i couldn't have done with series one except for the fact that i felt like the battery life was
[00:54:44.120 --> 00:54:49.400]   really short so and i don't i don't really think about it now maybe then i'm i don't know whether
[00:54:49.400 --> 00:54:52.760]   the battery life is that much longer or i've just gotten really good at charging you know because
[00:54:52.760 --> 00:54:58.040]   it's like i've got these little chargers sitting around and things and and so i'm constantly if i
[00:54:58.040 --> 00:55:01.160]   sit down at the desk for a while i just throw the i just throw the thing in there because i just
[00:55:01.160 --> 00:55:05.240]   don't want to think i series three lasts about two days now and it's with like a workout a day if i
[00:55:05.240 --> 00:55:09.320]   do two workouts and drops but if i do one workout it stays around two days you know how you fix that
[00:55:09.320 --> 00:55:15.560]   don't work out i was seeing how series was the answering so needy so thirsty series all right so
[00:55:15.560 --> 00:55:20.040]   we're gonna take a quick break we're gonna go back to leo in did he say he was in italy this time
[00:55:20.040 --> 00:55:27.640]   uh let me interrupt a little bit if you don't mind to talk about our sponsor rocket mortgage
[00:55:27.640 --> 00:55:36.840]   from quick and loans if you're ready to buy a house it's uh by all means do it i uh i bought my first
[00:55:36.840 --> 00:55:42.920]   house i was in my thirties already uh married and we had a kid on the way actually i think abby was
[00:55:42.920 --> 00:55:49.000]   already born so this was about 26 27 years ago and i was doing a real estate show and the realtor
[00:55:49.000 --> 00:55:57.160]   said leo you're still running and i said yeah leo you got to buy a house and i thought yeah
[00:55:57.160 --> 00:56:03.160]   i have a family we should own a house and that was the first house we bought now you know a few
[00:56:03.160 --> 00:56:07.720]   years later 26 years later i've bought a few houses since then one after the other i don't have more
[00:56:07.720 --> 00:56:12.680]   than one uh because it's a big deal it's probably the biggest thing you'll ever buy right the
[00:56:12.680 --> 00:56:18.600]   biggest check you'll ever write and each time i got a mortgage but i have learned a vital lesson
[00:56:18.600 --> 00:56:22.920]   last time leece and i we bought the house we're living in right now about four years ago we went
[00:56:22.920 --> 00:56:29.640]   to the big bank and first of all i don't like the idea of having to dress up and pretend you know
[00:56:29.640 --> 00:56:33.880]   oh yeah i'm prossi i don't need the loan i just i'm going to give you a chance to lend me some money
[00:56:33.880 --> 00:56:39.320]   and then they give you this boom big stack of papers and you got to fill it out go to the attic at the
[00:56:39.320 --> 00:56:44.360]   pay stubs go to the basement get the bank statements it's just a lot of work we were faxing stuff in
[00:56:44.360 --> 00:56:50.680]   for months literally took two months this next time we buy a house i know how i'm doing it
[00:56:50.680 --> 00:56:55.640]   quick and loans the number one lender in the country for several reasons number one in volume
[00:56:55.640 --> 00:57:00.920]   but i think that just happened like in december and that i'll tell you why because for eight years
[00:57:00.920 --> 00:57:06.200]   they've been number one in mortgage approval and customer satisfaction according to jd power so
[00:57:06.200 --> 00:57:11.880]   you you make customers happy you're going to be the biggest lender and that's exactly what's happened
[00:57:11.880 --> 00:57:16.280]   but they still have that customer centric focus and that's why i love rocket mortgage they've
[00:57:16.280 --> 00:57:21.000]   created a way to take the anxiety out of buying a house it's a it's going to be anxious making
[00:57:21.000 --> 00:57:24.360]   but at least you don't have to worry about interest rates going up you don't have to worry
[00:57:24.360 --> 00:57:27.720]   well are we good for it or anything like that here's what you do you can do it entirely online by the
[00:57:27.720 --> 00:57:32.520]   way no need to dress up and show off to a bank officer you just go to rocket mortgage dot com
[00:57:32.520 --> 00:57:37.800]   slash mac break the process is a three step process first step very quick under 10 minutes
[00:57:37.800 --> 00:57:43.480]   in in most cases i'm i'm not gonna i'm gonna say most cases under 10 minutes you go to rocket

[00:57:48.440 --> 00:57:53.720]   relationship with all the financial institutions they say is it okay if we uh you know verify you

[00:57:58.520 --> 00:58:04.120]   can show them now within 24 hours step two of the power buying process happens a loan officer looks
[00:58:04.120 --> 00:58:09.080]   over the stuff gets at his big rubber stamp boom boom you don't have to do anything this is all
[00:58:09.080 --> 00:58:15.160]   happening automatically and verifies you once you're verified you're basically it's called verified
[00:58:15.160 --> 00:58:18.360]   approval you basically get a letter you can print out if you want to show it to the realtor
[00:58:18.360 --> 00:58:22.840]   more importantly show it to the sellers realtor because that puts you right at the front of the
[00:58:22.840 --> 00:58:27.320]   line you basically it's like you have cash you're good for the money you've got the loan no contingencies

[00:59:52.360 --> 00:59:57.960]   we are blessed to have lory gill from i'm more here Alex Lindsey from the pixel core and
[00:59:57.960 --> 01:00:02.840]   andi and not co from both radio and internet fame print was not enough for him the man has
[01:00:02.840 --> 01:00:07.320]   expanded to our airwaves now as well and we're better off for it so we talked a lot about real
[01:00:07.320 --> 01:00:12.760]   products is time to talk a little bit about imaginary products or maybe not so imaginary one
[01:00:12.760 --> 01:00:19.800]   of apple's self-driving test vehicles which is not an apple car yet it's alexis suv with a ton
[01:00:19.800 --> 01:00:25.240]   oh sensors just stapled i think they literally use staples probably not but stapled to the roof
[01:00:25.240 --> 01:00:30.440]   was mining its own business about to get on to a california expressway which my understanding
[01:00:30.440 --> 01:00:38.920]   are incredibly complicated b-sts when it was malevolently and horribly rear-ended by a 15 mile
[01:00:38.920 --> 01:00:44.200]   an hour nissan leaf so apple is required to file these things with the department of motor vehicles
[01:00:44.200 --> 01:00:48.360]   the california department of motor vehicles which then helpfully puts it on the web so that every
[01:00:48.360 --> 01:00:55.160]   tech blog and business blog in the world can find it and publish it and there it is uh i mean lory
[01:00:55.160 --> 01:00:59.320]   we've been hearing rumors about apple cars for a long time and it's one of those things that you
[01:00:59.320 --> 01:01:03.640]   can't just keep in a lab you actually have to put it out on streets and that makes this really
[01:01:03.640 --> 01:01:09.880]   different from sort of an apple watchers perspective we get to see this sausage being made literally
[01:01:09.880 --> 01:01:15.320]   on the highways in front of us well i mean the only reason that we ever found out that this was
[01:01:15.320 --> 01:01:21.800]   an apple develop developing car that is because of the car accident so i mean you can put those
[01:01:21.800 --> 01:01:26.440]   out on the road and nobody needs to know who is is in charge of that most people are going to
[01:01:26.440 --> 01:01:34.120]   think it's tesla or something like that or google um if i'm reading this correctly the apple car the
[01:01:34.120 --> 01:01:41.720]   lexus that was driving was trying to get on the expressway going one mile per hour immediately
[01:01:41.720 --> 01:01:47.880]   those ruffics go up for me that's dangerous if they if they humans are scary lory
[01:01:47.880 --> 01:01:54.360]   like coming from a california girl who grew born and raised in california have never lived
[01:01:54.360 --> 01:01:59.800]   anywhere in my life if you can't get your car going 40 miles an hour by the time it gets on the freeway
[01:01:59.800 --> 01:02:07.960]   you're doing it wrong so uh this this definitely um if it really if that's not just like a uh typo
[01:02:07.960 --> 01:02:14.040]   and it was going 10 maybe 10 miles per hour instead of one mile per hour um that just they shouldn't
[01:02:14.040 --> 01:02:17.880]   try they shouldn't have been testing that out on the road at that point if that's the course i don't
[01:02:17.880 --> 01:02:22.040]   know we also don't know what time what time it was you know whether it was at one of the stoplights or
[01:02:22.040 --> 01:02:26.120]   what you know one of the you know on ramp lights or whether you know how busy it was i will say
[01:02:26.120 --> 01:02:30.440]   that probably the most one of the most complicated things a car has to do we don't think about it that
[01:02:30.440 --> 01:02:35.000]   much um as humans but probably one of the most complicated thing a car has to do is is merge you
[01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:40.360]   know merging on to a highway from another road is probably one of the harder things at that
[01:02:40.360 --> 01:02:45.320]   that other than rain or you know a lot of you know country roads or whatever even you know even
[01:02:45.320 --> 01:02:48.680]   those you're dealing with a lot of traffic you're most importantly you're dealing with a lot of
[01:02:48.680 --> 01:02:54.840]   humans and that's unfortunate for the machine because the humans are crazy you know and and so
[01:02:54.840 --> 01:02:59.400]   i think you know and uh so i think that that is that's probably the challenge i do agree with you
[01:02:59.400 --> 01:03:04.040]   though that i mean the the getting rear-ended is seems to be what most of these cars happen to
[01:03:04.040 --> 01:03:07.960]   because they're doing something other than what a human you know that's the
[01:03:07.960 --> 01:03:11.480]   accidents they're getting into is because the human don't know that they're a machine
[01:03:11.480 --> 01:03:16.920]   and think that they're going to act like a human and then don't and and and so uh and they run into
[01:03:16.920 --> 01:03:20.360]   it and it is still your responsibility everything in front of your car is still your responsibility so
[01:03:20.360 --> 01:03:27.160]   it doesn't let them off the hook but it does point to them acting different now i will argue that in
[01:03:27.160 --> 01:03:30.840]   again i think that in 20 or 30 years we're going to get to a point where do they just make a law that
[01:03:30.840 --> 01:03:35.240]   says on these highways you can't drive your own car like like it's just it's too much trouble to
[01:03:35.240 --> 01:03:39.400]   deal with humans and and you know if you want it won't be everything it'll be like you drive
[01:03:39.400 --> 01:03:43.000]   you know you might drive somewhere but you have to be hands-free but when they say hands-free it
[01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:47.880]   won't be hands-free or your phone it'll be hands-free for the car you know that that that you have to
[01:03:47.880 --> 01:03:53.240]   drive in in certain areas just because it it'll it'll be it'll create too many variables that they
[01:03:53.240 --> 01:03:59.640]   don't want to deal with yeah like so right in that case the if the if all of the cars are not being
[01:03:59.640 --> 01:04:05.560]   driven by humans then it's all going to be perfect because they all know the right way to drive
[01:04:05.560 --> 01:04:09.880]   it's all going to be perfect until someone hacks the car you know like like it's going to be
[01:04:09.880 --> 01:04:15.080]   real what they say you know what they say you know to air as human but to really screw things
[01:04:15.080 --> 01:04:19.960]   up requires a computer and i think that you know i think a whole bunch of automated cars that all
[01:04:19.960 --> 01:04:24.360]   are talking to each other is all great until someone hacks in and and and runs them like lemings
[01:04:24.360 --> 01:04:30.600]   off the side of the road yeah i think that rather than making it i think that if a version of that
[01:04:30.600 --> 01:04:36.680]   is implemented it will be just like there is a high occupancy vehicle lane there will be a separate
[01:04:36.680 --> 01:04:41.080]   automated vehicle lane because you can't you will i don't i don't think that you will ever be able to
[01:04:41.080 --> 01:04:48.840]   clear a road of a top of human driven vehicles because by definition that aces out anybody who
[01:04:48.840 --> 01:04:55.000]   can't afford a vehicle that was made in 2022 or later and that's not going to happen for a good
[01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:59.880]   good deal of time but it does it really does point out how difficult the last five percent of this
[01:04:59.880 --> 01:05:04.520]   problem is the first 95 percent you can solve with engineering you can just solve with money you can
[01:05:04.520 --> 01:05:11.000]   solve with training a model the last five percent is stuff like the the one the most one the most
[01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:17.800]   important factor is that keeps a driver safe is being able to get a read on what another driver is
[01:05:17.800 --> 01:05:22.120]   going to do not just simply there's a gap here or here's where the turnoff is or here's a condition
[01:05:22.120 --> 01:05:27.560]   of the road you merge into the highway but it's it's terrifying for a new driver because you have
[01:05:27.560 --> 01:05:33.160]   to trust that the that the traffic that is approaching sees you and does not want to smash into you
[01:05:33.160 --> 01:05:37.480]   because unless you're driving at 2 a.m. there's going to be traffic and they're gonna have to let you in
[01:05:37.480 --> 01:05:43.560]   similarly when you're on regular surface roads there's you have to know that a car has to know
[01:05:43.560 --> 01:05:49.160]   the difference i think that another article last week uh man and an algory that was so good that
[01:05:49.160 --> 01:05:52.840]   i'm gonna have to steal it even though i can't remember who to attribute it to if you see people
[01:05:52.840 --> 01:05:59.160]   if when you see people on pedestrians on the side of the road if you and you have to decide are these
[01:05:59.160 --> 01:06:04.600]   people going to jaywalk in front of the car or are they going to stay put if it is like four teens who
[01:06:04.600 --> 01:06:09.240]   are chatting and having a good time and looking at their phones you might slow down in case they
[01:06:09.240 --> 01:06:15.480]   jaywalk if it is three people who are who are clearly uh you know have time on their hands or
[01:06:15.480 --> 01:06:19.640]   whatever you make that judgment and that judgment call happens with other people as well so that's
[01:06:19.640 --> 01:06:26.440]   why this i don't think i think that having dedicated lanes of traffic for automated vehicles is going
[01:06:26.440 --> 01:06:33.080]   to come before we allow free roaming free range cars it's just another data point on how we really
[01:06:33.080 --> 01:06:39.880]   do have to reinvent surface transport for all the different classes of vehicles that didn't exist in
[01:06:39.880 --> 01:06:45.800]   the 1950s when all these roads were being built not just autonomous vehicles but also like self-powered
[01:06:45.800 --> 01:06:52.120]   vehicles personal electric vehicles like scooters and skateboards and bikes these are things you can
[01:06:52.120 --> 01:06:56.760]   just simply dump into existing infrastructure you have to rebuild with all this stuff in mind
[01:06:56.760 --> 01:07:02.600]   and there is no indication if anyone's curious that the person driving this leaf was a blogger or
[01:07:02.600 --> 01:07:09.240]   youtuber or podcaster hunting apple yeah autonomous vehicles this was a real a real honest accident
[01:07:09.240 --> 01:07:12.920]   but it does show how hard it is to keep these sort of things under wrap the other big leak this
[01:07:12.920 --> 01:07:18.200]   week we didn't talk about was someone left a pixel two excel in a cab and the cabbie was you
[01:07:18.200 --> 01:07:21.720]   know yeah what the guy wasn't even surprised like oh this is leaks so much i know immediately what
[01:07:21.720 --> 01:07:25.720]   this is here you can have it back that's sort of the state after after you took after you took a
[01:07:25.720 --> 01:07:31.240]   picture of it of course to put on social media yeah uh i mean that's where we've gotten to now
[01:07:31.240 --> 01:07:35.320]   the other one is that apple is again buying company this is another way that we sort of get
[01:07:35.320 --> 01:07:42.440]   hints at what apple is working on and this time it was uh an ar a company focused on it making
[01:07:42.440 --> 01:07:48.680]   ar lenses and one of apple special prograde pro sorry one of apple special project group is the
[01:07:48.680 --> 01:07:54.520]   titan project for car but the other one or at least one of the other ones is the apple glasses group
[01:07:54.520 --> 01:08:00.440]   and we still you know apple has famously tim cook loves his augmented reality he's talked about it
[01:08:00.440 --> 01:08:07.080]   all the time but this a conia holographics it's particularly lenses based and lory does that give
[01:08:07.080 --> 01:08:12.440]   you an indication that apple might be working on you know honest root and tuten sunglass shade
[01:08:12.440 --> 01:08:19.080]   glasses to put on our facels i mean yes and no so in on the one hand yeah why would they be buying
[01:08:19.080 --> 01:08:25.160]   it if they weren't looking into it so definitely they are looking into it in some respect but at the
[01:08:25.160 --> 01:08:30.200]   same time it's important to remember that you know google uh sorry the apple is buying up
[01:08:30.200 --> 01:08:35.320]   companies all the time in order to figure out if they're going to be doing the next
[01:08:35.320 --> 01:08:43.640]   the next thing involving that particular product so on the one hand all signs point to apple glasses
[01:08:43.640 --> 01:08:50.280]   in the future including comments that come from tim cook but there's been a lot of rumors for
[01:08:50.280 --> 01:08:57.080]   example about an apple branded television set i mean a decade minimum and we still haven't seen
[01:08:57.080 --> 01:09:00.520]   that yet and that doesn't mean it will happen it doesn't mean it won't happen it just means that
[01:09:00.520 --> 01:09:05.000]   sure apple is going to buy these companies and they're going to see whether or not they can use
[01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:10.440]   this technology to get what they want if they can't get what they want then it goes on a shelf and
[01:09:10.440 --> 01:09:16.520]   they they will come back to it in the future when technology is better so um ideally i want to see
[01:09:16.520 --> 01:09:25.240]   apple glasses in the same way that hollow lens kind of works um i'd like to have um like a lot of
[01:09:25.240 --> 01:09:33.800]   sort of ar interactivity um there i love this idea of being able to just wear glasses that will also
[01:09:33.800 --> 01:09:40.040]   act as a computer screen in front of me instead of a video game system i would prefer like the iron
[01:09:40.040 --> 01:09:46.120]   man display right yes yeah like a heads up display that has computer settings in front of you that
[01:09:46.120 --> 01:09:52.360]   you can look one way or another to get you know to point on something you can actually use gestures
[01:09:52.360 --> 01:09:58.040]   to um navigate through an interface or something like that i i think there's there should be definitely
[01:09:58.040 --> 01:10:05.400]   a separation between gaming vr and computer based ar and i i think that you could develop
[01:10:05.400 --> 01:10:11.400]   something beautiful with the apple design and and a pair of glasses that lets you interact with
[01:10:11.400 --> 01:10:16.280]   your computer instead of just play video games one and i think that i think that there's uh
[01:10:16.280 --> 01:10:22.040]   work when it's when it looks like my glasses you know when it's not much different not my glasses
[01:10:22.040 --> 01:10:26.360]   but this as simple as this and it's not more complicated and it doesn't look like a big
[01:10:26.360 --> 01:10:30.680]   thing on your on your head and uh you know i think that there's a whole range of things that
[01:10:30.680 --> 01:10:34.360]   you're talking about that are going to be great i mean it's it'll be as simple as like you walk
[01:10:34.360 --> 01:10:39.320]   into a party and it goes that her name is sherry his name is frank you know frank yes and as you're
[01:10:39.320 --> 01:10:43.560]   talking to frank you might see extra data about frank like frank has three kids and his his wife's
[01:10:43.560 --> 01:10:48.280]   name is as susan and you know like there gonna be a lot of things that that are kind of going on
[01:10:48.280 --> 01:10:53.880]   you know all kinds of extra data um that that's coming to you as you need it um that's contextual
[01:10:53.880 --> 01:10:57.160]   to what you're to what you're actually looking at and i think that we're gonna see a lot of that
[01:10:57.160 --> 01:11:00.440]   you know as we as we move forward it's going to be both i think audio will come first i think
[01:11:00.440 --> 01:11:05.960]   some of the patterns that we saw apple do years ago where they're able to control how much of the
[01:11:05.960 --> 01:11:12.280]   outside world that you hear uh i think that that's moving towards a a place where you put your
[01:11:12.280 --> 01:11:16.280]   buds in and you leave them in all day you know and and you don't really you know think about that
[01:11:16.280 --> 01:11:20.760]   much like you have a hearing aid but it wouldn't you wouldn't necessarily have bad hearing you
[01:11:20.760 --> 01:11:26.360]   just you just want to be able to interact with data all the time and so i think that this is one
[01:11:26.360 --> 01:11:32.600]   piece of it i think that how they use it i don't know whether that i think apple's math is probably
[01:11:32.600 --> 01:11:36.200]   very much of how many engineer hours and how much time will we spend trying to figure this out or
[01:11:36.200 --> 01:11:39.560]   we can spend x and a millions of dollars and just have those guys tell us how they did that part
[01:11:39.560 --> 01:11:44.840]   we may not see any of the technologies that are there um but they get they gather the patterns
[01:11:44.840 --> 01:11:48.840]   they gather the the the brain and and and they need those brains for x number of years i mean
[01:11:48.840 --> 01:11:53.400]   they don't need them forever they just need them to you know assimilate definitely in that area
[01:11:53.400 --> 01:11:56.920]   there's probably only a handful of people that really have thought about it enough then those
[01:11:56.920 --> 01:12:00.600]   guys are probably the ones and so they probably decided that they probably know a lot of be great
[01:12:00.600 --> 01:12:04.600]   to surround them with a team and give them some more resources and and see where it goes and
[01:12:04.600 --> 01:12:08.920]   they'll learn a lot and make a lot of decisions about their product line there's i think they're
[01:12:08.920 --> 01:12:14.440]   still very early on and i i don't expect to see anything soon from uh you know from from that but
[01:12:14.440 --> 01:12:20.440]   i think that it does put everybody else you know on notice that you know there's there's this kind
[01:12:20.440 --> 01:12:25.560]   of big lumbering tank that's slowly moving towards them you know it's not it's not fast it's not
[01:12:25.560 --> 01:12:28.760]   there you know but and they are taking advantage of the fact they have all those phones so all
[01:12:28.760 --> 01:12:34.040]   this ar technology all the tracking all the uh you know serie all those things i think are moving
[01:12:34.040 --> 01:12:40.600]   towards this this is this is this giant this is a very long play that serie ar all these things get
[01:12:40.600 --> 01:12:44.840]   to a point where we don't right now we don't take our computer anymore because we take our phone
[01:12:44.840 --> 01:12:48.520]   soon we're going to take you know five years from now six years from now and maybe we
[01:12:48.520 --> 01:12:51.640]   don't take anything we just make sure we're wearing our glasses you know i think that's the
[01:12:51.640 --> 01:12:57.240]   you know and maybe every once in a while the phone might become the tank yeah i think yeah i mean
[01:12:57.240 --> 01:13:03.480]   people we always think about uh all this all these all this hollywood movie sort of ways of doing ar
[01:13:03.480 --> 01:13:08.840]   i do think it's going to be as it could be as simple as in your office or in your house you have a
[01:13:08.840 --> 01:13:14.440]   picture you you decided you have a regular picture or poster print of whatever you usually have
[01:13:14.440 --> 01:13:19.880]   but it's in a frame that's in an unusual color or has an unusual bar pattern on the side of it
[01:13:19.880 --> 01:13:25.400]   and that means that what uh what that that that frame is there is for is so that when your ar glasses
[01:13:26.280 --> 01:13:32.280]   cast across that it knows that that is a place for that i want i want information to be projected
[01:13:32.280 --> 01:13:38.360]   such as here is the kitchen timer or here is a view of the front of the front porch or here is a
[01:13:38.360 --> 01:13:44.600]   chat a chat window that i'm doing it doesn't necessarily have to be covering uh hovering uh the sims
[01:13:44.600 --> 01:13:49.000]   type bubbles above people telling people what their what their happiness level is and who they are
[01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:54.680]   and last time you met them but this i mean the the thing to remember though and why ar is so
[01:13:54.680 --> 01:14:01.720]   important on phones is that their apple is and everyone else is waiting for hardware that doesn't
[01:14:01.720 --> 01:14:08.200]   exist yet and isn't even on the near horizon yet uh that's why every single group that is selling
[01:14:08.200 --> 01:14:15.880]   selling a wearable uh wearable i ar technology piece whether it's a hollow lens whether it's
[01:14:15.880 --> 01:14:20.680]   whether it's magic lens whether it's whatever that they're selling it as a developer kit
[01:14:20.680 --> 01:14:25.080]   so that developers can experiment and figure out what they're doing and what kind of stuff they
[01:14:25.080 --> 01:14:30.120]   want to make the stuff that people would actually want to wear on their faces uh and not even something
[01:14:30.120 --> 01:14:36.120]   as nerdy as these glasses but even even if people are if even if apple and other companies can
[01:14:36.120 --> 01:14:40.440]   create a product that's so compelling they're willing to wear something with thicker uh thicker
[01:14:40.440 --> 01:14:45.480]   arms to it or a thicker bridge here uh that is so far in the future that it's like we're talking
[01:14:45.480 --> 01:14:51.640]   about we can talk about all the different ways we would run a surface mission on Mars we don't know
[01:14:51.640 --> 01:14:56.840]   how to get there yet we don't have they we don't have the hardware to get there yet uh or maybe
[01:14:56.840 --> 01:15:02.040]   maybe Jupiter is a better way of explaining it we just don't have the hardware to get there yet we
[01:15:02.040 --> 01:15:07.960]   know once we have a pair of glasses that can actually be comfortable to wear and not not disruptive we
[01:15:07.960 --> 01:15:15.320]   know what software we want to put on it but we don't have it yet and it's kind of amazing
[01:15:15.320 --> 01:15:18.920]   that you can that you can have a company that can spend probably hundreds of millions of dollars
[01:15:18.920 --> 01:15:23.080]   on something that that you know we'll see how it turns out you know we'll we'll you know like let's
[01:15:23.080 --> 01:15:28.360]   just keep on putting you know just turning you know having these huge crews you know figuring
[01:15:28.360 --> 01:15:32.040]   something out that you know is going to be a big deal um and i think that as we look at the
[01:15:32.040 --> 01:15:36.600]   reason that apple is probably still going to keep on growing value is if you look out into the car
[01:15:36.600 --> 01:15:42.120]   you know industry and into the into the AR industry you know there's still still a lot of room to
[01:15:42.120 --> 01:15:46.040]   grow for the company and it's interesting the laurie's point you know apple was working on a
[01:15:46.040 --> 01:15:50.120]   television they made several prototypes but the decision was made not to move it into production
[01:15:50.120 --> 01:15:55.080]   because apple couldn't according to the the tim cook doctor and they couldn't find a compelling
[01:15:55.080 --> 01:15:59.880]   way to sell that product that would be differentiated and also make them you know crap ton of money
[01:15:59.880 --> 01:16:04.280]   which is what they do when they enter product category so it's sitting in the lab we're in johnny
[01:16:04.280 --> 01:16:08.600]   ives house and there's a bunch of other products uh you know famously again a thousand nose for
[01:16:08.600 --> 01:16:13.320]   every yes that apple does explore and because of their wealth but also because of their process
[01:16:13.320 --> 01:16:19.240]   they can make a thousand ideas to spill that down to uh a hundred prototypes to let down to 10
[01:16:19.240 --> 01:16:24.280]   working models and then make a choice say okay yeah the phone is a go the tablet is a go the
[01:16:24.280 --> 01:16:29.640]   television set is not a go and you know that jetpack thing will just save that for 2030 when it you
[01:16:29.640 --> 01:16:33.320]   know makes more sense uh that's one of the most interesting ways about it almost anything that we
[01:16:33.320 --> 01:16:37.160]   can think of they actually have the money to prototype which is really fun place to be
[01:16:38.040 --> 01:16:42.600]   there was another story that came out uh right before i ship back to to leo and then to pick
[01:16:42.600 --> 01:16:47.400]   so the week it's not on the list but i just saw it before uh we started the show and that's an
[01:16:47.400 --> 01:16:53.400]   editorial by niele patel of the verge on whether or not facebook should be split apart into component
[01:16:53.400 --> 01:16:59.720]   companies you know instagram whatsapp and facebook uh and the argument being made there is that the
[01:16:59.720 --> 01:17:04.840]   the justice department the antitrust laws especially in north america no longer keep up with the way
[01:17:04.840 --> 01:17:09.560]   the companies are evolving and the wall things like the sprint and t-mobile merger gets a lot of
[01:17:09.560 --> 01:17:14.920]   scrutiny and things like disney and fox and maybe time Warner those sorts of things when facebook
[01:17:14.920 --> 01:17:19.880]   buys these company or google buys these companies or apple or amazon buys these companies there's
[01:17:19.880 --> 01:17:26.600]   almost no oversight to it and some people have expressed uh sort of concern that the basic argument
[01:17:26.600 --> 01:17:31.000]   is when you talk to a marco zucker burger you talk to a jeff bezos is you can take a little bit of
[01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:35.960]   money for your company now or will just duplicate the features and you won't have a company tomorrow
[01:17:35.960 --> 01:17:40.280]   and that a lot of the times these features are duplicative like you can post photos on facebook
[01:17:40.280 --> 01:17:47.560]   or instagram you can send messages on uh whatsapp or through facebook messenger and it's not so much
[01:17:47.560 --> 01:17:53.720]   that it's adding or integrating value to facebook but it's preventing competition by sort of buying
[01:17:53.720 --> 01:17:59.240]   it up and locking it up before it can become too competitive before it can offer uh viable
[01:17:59.240 --> 01:18:03.480]   alternatives like maybe instagram would have been a more privacy focused service or maybe what's
[01:18:03.480 --> 01:18:07.640]   app would have continued to be subscription and not ad base you know all these things that might
[01:18:07.640 --> 01:18:11.960]   have been more compelling and more valuable to a wider range of consumers and i was sort of curious
[01:18:11.960 --> 01:18:16.040]   what what you guys thought not just about the facebook's and the googles and the amazon's
[01:18:16.040 --> 01:18:21.480]   but about the apple as well and whether we need more models to sort of maintain consumer choice
[01:18:21.480 --> 01:18:27.480]   as we move more and more in the technology age i think we're still gonna have i go go ahead
[01:18:27.480 --> 01:18:33.480]   and i was gonna say uh not in this election cycle but i think in the next election cycle in two years
[01:18:33.480 --> 01:18:40.040]   all every large company starting with facebook and google but even apple they're gonna have to
[01:18:40.040 --> 01:18:44.920]   have a game plan for what happens when uh the federal trade commission or worse the department
[01:18:44.920 --> 01:18:49.560]   of justice starts knocking on their doors and saying that you are an anti-competitive company
[01:18:49.560 --> 01:18:55.000]   you are your your existence in your current form is bad for the market and we want to do something
[01:18:55.000 --> 01:19:01.000]   to address that so i think they're they're gonna have to think about that i i agree i have obviously
[01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:07.800]   haven't read that article i think that uh breaking up facebook into making sure that they have to have
[01:19:07.800 --> 01:19:11.880]   separate units as instagram and whatsapp i don't think that would hurt the user experience for
[01:19:11.880 --> 01:19:17.080]   facebook users instagram users or whatsapp users i do believe that simply a we want to own this so
[01:19:17.080 --> 01:19:21.800]   that no one else can own this we want to be able to extend our reach into these other realms uh that
[01:19:21.800 --> 01:19:26.840]   is certainly healthy i think for the market i don't think that breaking up a company like google
[01:19:26.840 --> 01:19:34.920]   is healthy because they do uh there is a four-hour introductory argument to be had about the extent
[01:19:34.920 --> 01:19:40.360]   uh and the and the positivity or negativity of of of google's data collection activities
[01:19:40.360 --> 01:19:46.200]   but the fact that android i'm using the google's operating system and google services together
[01:19:46.200 --> 01:19:51.080]   makes in addition to abusing my personal privacy it also gives me a whole bunch of
[01:19:51.080 --> 01:19:55.640]   features that i actually like that i think would be a different thing but i think google's google's
[01:19:55.640 --> 01:20:00.760]   in there in the federal government's headlights even more strongly than facebook is right now
[01:20:00.760 --> 01:20:05.240]   so i but i do believe that every large company is going to have to deal with it the EU has not had
[01:20:05.240 --> 01:20:12.040]   any qua has not had any qualms about uh taking these companies to task google particularly to
[01:20:12.040 --> 01:20:16.680]   tell them that you have an unfair advantage uh but the difference in between the EU and the
[01:20:16.680 --> 01:20:22.280]   united states is that uh the european unions uh anti-trust laws as it were the question they
[01:20:22.280 --> 01:20:28.200]   ask is is this creating a bad experience for consumer choice in the united states anti-trust
[01:20:28.200 --> 01:20:33.000]   usually ask a question is this causing a bad experience for other companies who are trying
[01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:38.520]   to operate in that market so that's the stock could be quite as easy to get justice for consumers
[01:20:38.520 --> 01:20:43.720]   uh here i think sometimes in the u.s. yeah i i think it'll be complicated i think that you know
[01:20:43.720 --> 01:20:48.520]   to do they really are gonna have to rethink the rules i think that that you know the the current
[01:20:48.520 --> 01:20:53.960]   infrastructure really requires uh a certain level like for instance apple is a massive company
[01:20:53.960 --> 01:20:58.440]   with minority stakes in the in the in a pretty much every area they work in so they you know
[01:20:58.440 --> 01:21:02.680]   they have a majority stake in in the iPhone world but in the phone world there's still a
[01:21:02.680 --> 01:21:07.960]   minority uh stakeholder and so so i think that that apple's a good example of a place that it
[01:21:07.960 --> 01:21:12.200]   would be difficult to um you know to do that i think that google would have more trouble if
[01:21:12.200 --> 01:21:16.680]   facebook didn't exist you know uh apple would have more trouble if android didn't exist so there's
[01:21:16.680 --> 01:21:20.680]   you know i think that the fact that the you know there's only a handful of companies um you know
[01:21:20.680 --> 01:21:24.600]   we have proven that we're willing to let that happen if you look at our phone companies uh in
[01:21:24.600 --> 01:21:29.400]   our cable companies there's not that much choice and we've decided that that's that's okay because
[01:21:29.400 --> 01:21:34.360]   of the scale and so i think that i do think that there's an incredible amount of leverage that these
[01:21:34.360 --> 01:21:41.400]   companies have uh everything from i mean the the thing that is in many ways frightening and even and
[01:21:41.400 --> 01:21:46.440]   i know that i participated in it is i as i i started to watch closely the way amazon works amazon's
[01:21:46.440 --> 01:21:51.720]   got all this data um and and so what they do is they start if something's relatively easy to make
[01:21:51.720 --> 01:21:55.480]   and you're making it and they know that they're selling a lot of it they make one just like it
[01:21:55.480 --> 01:22:01.080]   the amazon basics you know lineup is is the situation now they're not a majority they don't hold a
[01:22:01.080 --> 01:22:06.680]   majority stake in any business and so it makes it again complicated to to adjudicate but it's it's
[01:22:06.680 --> 01:22:13.400]   one of those things that uh you you end up in a situation where uh how do you deal with that
[01:22:13.400 --> 01:22:16.760]   because it's it's not just happening there it's happening in scale in a lot of places whether it's
[01:22:16.760 --> 01:22:21.080]   walmart i mean walmart destroys companies i mean you know like when that when it comes in because
[01:22:21.080 --> 01:22:25.640]   it's gonna go you're gonna give us this price and your margin is going to be so thin you can't measure
[01:22:25.640 --> 01:22:31.080]   it and if we don't like it tomorrow we'll just not buy anymore you know and and that's kind of the
[01:22:31.560 --> 01:22:36.920]   uh you know that that kind of low margin process and i think that i think that is going to be a
[01:22:36.920 --> 01:22:43.240]   challenge for a lot of folks i do think though it's going to be hard to get the you have to change
[01:22:43.240 --> 01:22:47.000]   the laws well you're not going to be able to make any significant difference i mean the EU can do
[01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:50.840]   stuff because they're crazy you know like what i mean by that is that they just they don't have
[01:22:50.840 --> 01:22:54.680]   any rules i mean they don't have any like they just make they just there's a bunch of guys in
[01:22:54.680 --> 01:22:59.960]   Brussels that just make stuff up so so they they're able to i mean they do i mean there's just like
[01:22:59.960 --> 01:23:04.600]   sounds wrong but we'll litigate it i don't think that this seems right so we're gonna say there's
[01:23:04.600 --> 01:23:10.200]   like no like no constitution in the way that we have it or no set of precedents it doesn't seem
[01:23:10.200 --> 01:23:13.960]   anyway from an outsider i gotta tell you it's just like you watch it you go i have no idea what
[01:23:13.960 --> 01:23:17.080]   they're gonna do next you know it's like it's like it's like a crazy football game it's like
[01:23:17.080 --> 01:23:23.880]   also no anyway so let's do that so um so they don't you know without that underpinning of of the rule
[01:23:23.880 --> 01:23:29.720]   of law and precedent and constitution you know they they may do a lot of crazy things um i do think
[01:23:29.720 --> 01:23:33.880]   that if they go too far i do think that you're going to end up with a situation where now we're in
[01:23:33.880 --> 01:23:39.400]   a lot of international quandary of they start making rules that are a lot more intense you've
[01:23:39.400 --> 01:23:45.080]   already seen some with GDPR there are some folks that just turned off europe just like
[01:23:45.080 --> 01:23:49.240]   mr and center weibo won't have the same anti-competitive laws applied against them and then it's how
[01:23:49.240 --> 01:23:52.360]   does facebook compete with international companies that are under the same scrutiny
[01:23:53.080 --> 01:23:59.560]   right right so it's so i think that and and and while you can reproduce certain things that part
[01:23:59.560 --> 01:24:04.280]   of your job as a company i mean we have worked uh you know closely with some of these companies and
[01:24:04.280 --> 01:24:07.880]   and you know part of your job as a company is to look for things that aren't that they can't
[01:24:07.880 --> 01:24:11.320]   replace and figure out how you're going to do that and you're either going to patent it or you're
[01:24:11.320 --> 01:24:14.600]   going i mean part of this is just a as a business owner you have to make those decisions and you
[01:24:14.600 --> 01:24:18.040]   have to have that tactic you know i'm not ready to say the government should protect everybody
[01:24:18.040 --> 01:24:22.200]   from everybody else you know the that that if you're building a business and you think that
[01:24:22.200 --> 01:24:27.720]   facebook can can reproduce it then you should either you know and you and you can't survive without
[01:24:27.720 --> 01:24:31.800]   that that differentiator you better find another differentiator you better sell like that is the
[01:24:31.800 --> 01:24:37.160]   you know like that is the reality and they have to keep on finding you know and and you know you
[01:24:37.160 --> 01:24:41.240]   have to keep on evolving you know that you can't build a business anymore not in this industry
[01:24:41.240 --> 01:24:44.680]   you're not in this world you cannot build a business that does the same thing over and over
[01:24:44.680 --> 01:24:49.640]   again unless you're extremely good you know or extremely unique you know you just it's just not
[01:24:50.760 --> 01:24:56.040]   mediocre is not something that is a viable option did we see this lory like when you know
[01:24:56.040 --> 01:25:00.120]   instagram sold to facebook and that's fine but then snapchat wouldn't so facebook made instagram
[01:25:00.120 --> 01:25:09.320]   into snapchat i don't know so i see what you're saying here so yeah there was a time when instagram
[01:25:09.320 --> 01:25:14.840]   wasn't owned by facebook it was its own entity and it was doing fantastic it didn't need to sell to
[01:25:14.840 --> 01:25:23.400]   facebook it was holding its own by itself but it did so when when that comes along when there's a
[01:25:23.400 --> 01:25:33.720]   um to like a big big major let's say social networking company that is so big that it can
[01:25:33.720 --> 01:25:37.960]   gobble everybody up and then there's one that's not as big but they're doing fine on their own
[01:25:37.960 --> 01:25:45.480]   completely separate features why why not sell because that's that's what the world is like right
[01:25:45.480 --> 01:25:51.320]   now like your your dream most people a lot of people in the in the software building industry
[01:25:51.320 --> 01:25:56.440]   and then in the developer industry is to build a really great product and then sell it to somebody
[01:25:56.440 --> 01:26:00.440]   for a million two million three million five million twenty million dollars why would you
[01:26:00.440 --> 01:26:06.920]   really write down well and again i think that snaps snaps current issues and i don't think they're
[01:26:06.920 --> 01:26:10.840]   necessarily i mean they they still have a lot of things that that make them different but you
[01:26:10.840 --> 01:26:15.640]   know they're they're current issues were self-inflicted it wasn't because they got copied by um you know
[01:26:15.640 --> 01:26:20.280]   by instagram it was because they changed their interface radically and people didn't like it
[01:26:20.280 --> 01:26:26.840]   but i think snapchat is still just as viable as instagram absolutely different types of people
[01:26:26.840 --> 01:26:32.440]   it's it didn't look like so that's a great example instagram getting instris stories or however you
[01:26:32.440 --> 01:26:37.640]   were calling it it that didn't ruin snapchat snapchat was like that's cool we still we're still doing
[01:26:37.640 --> 01:26:42.920]   fine we're we're going forward so there isn't necessarily the need for regulation when it comes
[01:26:42.920 --> 01:26:49.480]   to features that you add to your to your software program because there's evidence that both can
[01:26:49.480 --> 01:26:56.440]   still exist um so i don't it's it seems like such a wild west right now of of software and
[01:26:56.440 --> 01:27:02.440]   development and and what is considered okay and what consider is considered sort of um
[01:27:02.440 --> 01:27:09.800]   not being a healthy competition for consumers or for for the industry itself
[01:27:09.800 --> 01:27:15.080]   it's it's very it's still sewn everything is still so new that's difficult to see
[01:27:15.080 --> 01:27:20.120]   the writing on the wall and see what is going to be okay and what's not going to be okay going
[01:27:20.120 --> 01:27:24.360]   forward and when when the government does need to step in and make some changes there
[01:27:25.320 --> 01:27:28.600]   you know they're thinking of letting studios own movie theaters again Alex it's the end of time
[01:27:28.600 --> 01:27:33.960]   but they're not studios that that's the thing that makes it complicated is is uh
[01:27:33.960 --> 01:27:38.440]   and and i don't think that i think that the challenge there is that this the movie theaters
[01:27:38.440 --> 01:27:42.200]   don't have the same leverage that they used to i mean they're not this gets back into this whole
[01:27:42.200 --> 01:27:46.040]   situation where that market is no longer the market that it was before when we said that was
[01:27:46.040 --> 01:27:52.280]   the only way to release your film back then now there's a a lot of ways to release your film and
[01:27:52.280 --> 01:27:59.000]   so it doesn't make as much sense to to hold out um you know that process uh because it there's not
[01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:03.480]   a monopoly anymore there's not you know i don't know if the studios will you know the studios are
[01:28:03.480 --> 01:28:07.880]   surviving basically by selling into the into the new distribution models i mean there if you look at
[01:28:07.880 --> 01:28:13.240]   you know the new amazon i started watching jack ryan which i was pretty sure i wasn't gonna like
[01:28:13.240 --> 01:28:18.040]   and then it's good again and so yeah yeah i'm hooked it's it's okay here's the deal it's good
[01:28:18.040 --> 01:28:22.120]   enough to keep me watching it there's still a little too much slowness in it but it's it's fine
[01:28:22.120 --> 01:28:25.960]   it's there's it's a little plotting but then they give you just enough action that you're like oh
[01:28:25.960 --> 01:28:35.320]   i gotta come back again you know so so the um uh so um uh so anyway the but i but that one's i
[01:28:35.320 --> 01:28:40.520]   think produced by paramount you know like so the studios are you know just yeah you know a lot of
[01:28:40.520 --> 01:28:44.680]   people try to self build this you know youtube try to do it themselves facebook try to do it
[01:28:44.680 --> 01:28:48.520]   themselves you know uh you know like where you're trying to work with creators and do all this
[01:28:48.520 --> 01:28:51.720]   up and eventually they realize i'll just go to the let's just hire a bunch of showrunners and just
[01:28:51.720 --> 01:28:55.640]   turn in a bunch of shows and so so in a lot of ways we're still getting the same thing that we got
[01:28:55.640 --> 01:29:00.440]   before it just new new outlets and people just decide how much you know how many dollars per minute
[01:29:00.440 --> 01:29:05.560]   they want to spend and that's kind of the you know facebook being kind of on the low end and hbob
[01:29:05.560 --> 01:29:09.880]   being kind of on the on the high end and you know everybody just kind of sprinkles in between
[01:29:09.880 --> 01:29:16.280]   yeah it's interesting all right so one last break with our good friend and traveling
[01:29:17.240 --> 01:29:22.360]   emador entertainer leo leport and then back with picture of the week abadashir abadashir
[01:29:22.360 --> 01:29:28.680]   funny thing hap oh i'm sorry thanks guys yes i know i'm not here i'm on vacation but i had to come
[01:29:28.680 --> 01:29:35.480]   back to tell you a story it won't take a long uh we we mentioned this before we for years uh
[01:29:35.480 --> 01:29:42.280]   i've been using hip chat we're kind of in that lassian house to communicate and but secretly
[01:29:42.840 --> 01:29:46.680]   and i've even i've hinted at this i've always wanted to go back to slack we use slack
[01:29:46.680 --> 01:29:52.200]   for a while when we're doing uh our our new website which is now what a couple years old
[01:29:52.200 --> 01:29:57.560]   and i loved it i just loved it it was so much easier to use i loved the interface i loved all
[01:29:57.560 --> 01:30:02.440]   the integrations but least i said well you know we're already we're using hip chat i don't want to
[01:30:02.440 --> 01:30:08.840]   be you know there's a resistance so news comes a couple months ago hip chat is joining slack
[01:30:09.640 --> 01:30:15.800]   at lassian is taking a stack a a percentage of slack i guess and they and they're gonna give
[01:30:15.800 --> 01:30:22.840]   them hip chat and i'm running around going yeah yeah get my slack i get my slack yeah i was so happy
[01:30:22.840 --> 01:30:32.200]   so uh thank you we are moving over slack is really is the best collaboration hub for work
[01:30:32.200 --> 01:30:38.600]   and it really was a revelation because prior to this we were using email right you you might be
[01:30:38.600 --> 01:30:45.160]   using email email is not ideal because not real time slack is real time it's fast it's quick you can
[01:30:45.160 --> 01:30:49.480]   just you don't it's not all the rigmarole of an email you just type of thing and it's boom
[01:30:49.480 --> 01:30:53.640]   and it's asynchronous too though if somebody's you know and i love slack they have things like
[01:30:53.640 --> 01:30:59.000]   okay i'm down i'm this is offline time don't bug me that's really important when you're working to
[01:30:59.000 --> 01:31:03.720]   have some time that you're not working so you can set that in slack and then when you come back on
[01:31:03.720 --> 01:31:09.080]   when you're working again you'll get the message so it's really convenient it's really easy it's
[01:31:09.080 --> 01:31:14.920]   much better than emails it streamlines your team's communication it also has the most
[01:31:14.920 --> 01:31:21.320]   integrations i've ever seen we use a number of different services google docs yeah but also pan
[01:31:21.320 --> 01:31:27.800]   opta for the web to monitor the web servers and stuff like that all integrates in painlessly with
[01:31:27.800 --> 01:31:36.760]   slack so it's all in there uh Russell is happy too all right he's a contract IT guys so he has to
[01:31:36.760 --> 01:31:42.040]   use everything right he's glad he says oh good thank god you're moving to slack that's what i put my
[01:31:42.040 --> 01:31:48.280]   clients on to easy it's convenient you've got drag and drop file sharing it works with with jira we
[01:31:48.280 --> 01:31:54.520]   use jira confluence works with that that's another integration we've got um we use uh um
[01:31:55.800 --> 01:32:02.040]   the jira agile stuff that works with that sales force zendesk and we of course we're big

[01:32:51.000 --> 01:32:55.720]   support i was jumping up and down when i heard it. i don't know if we actually gave lori gill
[01:32:55.720 --> 01:33:00.440]   time to prepare for a pick of a week so i'm gonna let you go last lori just in case you want just
[01:33:00.440 --> 01:33:05.240]   you know you want a little bit extra time to nail one down and in case anybody has any oh you do
[01:33:05.240 --> 01:33:09.560]   you want to go first yeah i just need them all right just do it before Alex can get to it okay
[01:33:09.560 --> 01:33:15.880]   so um i was tossing back and forth as to whether or not i wanted to choose this as my pick but i it's
[01:33:15.880 --> 01:33:21.800]   something that surprised me how much i ended up liking it it's called the nomad slim wallet with
[01:33:21.800 --> 01:33:28.360]   tile tracking so it's just it's a standard card based wallet so it's little slots for all of your
[01:33:28.360 --> 01:33:33.960]   credit cards but it comes with a tile tracker this the thin tile tracker um so that you can find
[01:33:33.960 --> 01:33:39.240]   your wallet if you lose it and and in the reverse you can find your phone by using your wallet there's
[01:33:39.240 --> 01:33:44.440]   it's just a little thing that you press on the inside it's beautiful it's made out of really good
[01:33:44.440 --> 01:33:51.800]   quality leather um i i got one for review and i i literally thought oh you know the wallet itself
[01:33:51.800 --> 01:33:57.640]   it's not my favorite kind of design i like to have like a larger fold out so that i can slide my
[01:33:57.640 --> 01:34:02.520]   money in um so i'll probably just pull out the down tracker and put it back in my current wallet
[01:34:02.520 --> 01:34:08.520]   i love this wallet so much that it is now my new official wallet for all times i was literally
[01:34:08.520 --> 01:34:13.720]   planning on giving it to my my significant other because i figured he he'd prefer something it's
[01:34:13.720 --> 01:34:19.480]   just mostly can only fit your cards and you have to cram your your money and i love it it fits all
[01:34:19.480 --> 01:34:26.840]   of my stuff it fits my money and i don't it doesn't take up very much space um it's it stretches out
[01:34:26.840 --> 01:34:31.480]   just enough because it's made out of this really supple leather that will kind of expand with the
[01:34:31.480 --> 01:34:35.080]   things that you want to cram and the cards and things you want to cram in there so it'll fit them
[01:34:35.080 --> 01:34:39.480]   it'll keep fitting them at some point it will come it'll burst and it won't be a comfortable fit anymore
[01:34:39.480 --> 01:34:46.600]   but it turns out even though i usually prefer a wallet that's a little larger that i can kind of
[01:34:46.600 --> 01:34:52.840]   fold out large enough to slide some paper money in plus have lots of extra slots for cards and maybe
[01:34:52.840 --> 01:34:59.880]   even a a zipper spot for your change or something like that it turns out that this is the exact right
[01:34:59.880 --> 01:35:06.360]   size for me and their exact right design for me so and the fact that it comes with the um the
[01:35:06.360 --> 01:35:11.320]   title tracker to help me if i lose my phone or in the reverse if i lose my wallet
[01:35:11.320 --> 01:35:17.320]   turns out this is the perfect thing for me so there you go and it's awesome because with ios 12
[01:35:17.320 --> 01:35:21.640]   it'll just be able to say where's my wallet and it'll eat for you and and there'll be some series
[01:35:21.640 --> 01:35:27.800]   shortcut that will actually take my it'll legs will appear on my iphone and walk over to my wallet
[01:35:27.800 --> 01:35:33.400]   why don't now speeches i love it all right if people have any money left over from the wallet
[01:35:33.400 --> 01:35:41.160]   what can they get so we had to print a bunch of images for our green room and and i was trying to
[01:35:41.160 --> 01:35:45.800]   think i don't really like frames and i was trying to figure out what to do and i finally found these
[01:35:45.800 --> 01:35:51.240]   a bunch of different services that do it but the ones that i ordered are these metal prints
[01:35:51.240 --> 01:35:55.880]   from nation's photo lab and i had never really gotten metal prints and so i was kind of like i
[01:35:55.880 --> 01:36:00.600]   don't i don't know what they'll be like so i ordered a couple just to see and they weren't they weren't
[01:36:00.600 --> 01:36:05.400]   they're not super expensive they come in a lot of different sizes and i've got i've got a little
[01:36:05.400 --> 01:36:10.280]   bit of everything just to see how they turned out and they just look great and so i would you know
[01:36:10.280 --> 01:36:15.000]   just definitely if you want to play with a new idea of a way to put up photos and you literally
[01:36:15.000 --> 01:36:19.640]   just upload your photos and they came back and they you know they they look you know they're very
[01:36:19.640 --> 01:36:25.800]   glossy i mean you know they but that was what i wanted but the the colors are very rich and
[01:36:25.800 --> 01:36:30.120]   and they're you know pretty easy to put up they have they have a couple of them that have like little
[01:36:30.120 --> 01:36:37.320]   you can you a lot of different styles of them but really was was happy with them and so it's just
[01:36:37.320 --> 01:36:42.760]   it was something new and different that i started doing really nice uh they're really printed on
[01:36:42.760 --> 01:36:48.600]   metal it's like a sheet of metal with an image on it and there's a variety you can order from them
[01:36:48.600 --> 01:36:52.120]   you know a little backings a little wood blocks that just kind of stick to the back of them or you
[01:36:52.120 --> 01:36:56.040]   can they have ones that they have things that kind of separate them from the wall they're like
[01:36:56.040 --> 01:36:59.720]   metal pieces in the corners if you want them and so there's a lot of different ways to put them on
[01:36:59.720 --> 01:37:05.240]   the wall but it's just i think it's just a cleaner look than i just don't like the
[01:37:05.240 --> 01:37:10.920]   artifice of a of a uh of frames you know like i just like the photo but you couldn't put just
[01:37:10.920 --> 01:37:13.480]   the photo up there because you needed to have something to give it structure well the metal
[01:37:13.480 --> 01:37:17.240]   gives it structure so it has the structure that it needs and it sits a little off the you know the
[01:37:17.240 --> 01:37:21.880]   way i have them set up and sits a little off the wall and and they're um they're quite nice so um
[01:37:21.880 --> 01:37:26.040]   i would definitely try printing them if you're looking for something a different way to display
[01:37:26.040 --> 01:37:31.400]   your photos that's awesome thank you Alex and the in not co
[01:37:31.400 --> 01:37:39.240]   uh mine is kind of a double pick here uh because uh it is a 1989 Mac user magazine
[01:37:39.240 --> 01:37:45.800]   Eddy award trophy statue one of the most beautiful knickknacks that an apple apple fan can have
[01:37:45.800 --> 01:37:51.000]   these are the annuals these are the annual hardware and software awards that Mac user
[01:37:51.000 --> 01:37:57.880]   my alma mater used to give out every single year uh these aren't like uh these aren't like you
[01:37:57.880 --> 01:38:03.240]   you you you click a form on a website and they engrave something onto a square of lu site this is
[01:38:03.240 --> 01:38:12.840]   an actual like heavy piece of brass sculpture of a academy award looking featureless guy holding up
[01:38:12.840 --> 01:38:20.280]   a Mac se as if to either praise it or throw it into a canyon uh it is now uh it's it's offered
[01:38:20.280 --> 01:38:25.400]   it's it's uh four days left in the options it's Tuesday right now so until the end of this week
[01:38:25.400 --> 01:38:31.720]   uh ends on friday's excuse me uh don't know what it ends but it ends uh saturday at nine p.m.
[01:38:31.720 --> 01:38:38.280]   eastern time uh and with a buy it now price of two hundred and eighty five dollars uh which now
[01:38:38.280 --> 01:38:43.320]   uh this is why i i think it would be a great knickknack for anyone who wants any Mac fan who
[01:38:43.320 --> 01:38:48.200]   wants something beautiful in their how in their home also if you were to buy it you will prevent
[01:38:48.200 --> 01:38:54.440]   me from buying it uh because because two hundred eighty five dollars i got two hundred and eighty
[01:38:54.440 --> 01:38:59.480]   five dollars but that is well within the realm of well here are other remember that remember how
[01:38:59.480 --> 01:39:04.280]   you know how like you don't actually have like windows uh sconces in your new wind in your in
[01:39:04.280 --> 01:39:08.840]   your new place and you really need to spend a few hundred dollars to like get the windows like really
[01:39:08.840 --> 01:39:13.720]   really finish that way maybe instead of buying another knickknack you should just get the window
[01:39:13.720 --> 01:39:18.360]   so so that's why i'm saying if you were to buy it uh in buy do you do the buy it now
[01:39:18.360 --> 01:39:24.200]   it will remove all temp all temptation for me to buy it and it will allow me to again finally get
[01:39:24.200 --> 01:39:28.600]   proper window treatments in my office and in my life let's say buy it for you Andy and then it
[01:39:28.600 --> 01:39:34.760]   solves both problems well i didn't want to come on say that i'm saying that but thank you for saying
[01:39:34.760 --> 01:39:42.360]   instead of me this would this this would be this would be this would be the classic case of no no i
[01:39:42.360 --> 01:39:45.560]   couldn't possibly thank you very much
[01:39:45.560 --> 01:39:51.720]   i'd like to thank all my fans for this award that they bought for me
[01:39:51.720 --> 01:39:57.560]   i will i will i will give you the oscar speech if i if i get it i get when when when
[01:39:57.560 --> 01:40:01.880]   when meccus are shut down i knew they're emptying out the offices i did spread the word that i don't
[01:40:01.880 --> 01:40:07.000]   know if you guys got any extra ones hanging around but i you know after 10 years of being the back
[01:40:07.000 --> 01:40:12.360]   page columnist i'd kind of like to have that as of as as a souvenir but no not even a not even a
[01:40:12.360 --> 01:40:17.480]   lifetime achievement eddie award did i earn for my work i understand that i have i have the first
[01:40:17.480 --> 01:40:22.760]   drafts of all my stuff so i i know that that would be a travesty at best did you have something else
[01:40:22.760 --> 01:40:29.320]   Andy nope that was it okay mine is more of a reminder than a pick i did pick this previously on the
[01:40:29.320 --> 01:40:35.480]   show it's the book creative selection by can quicenda and it is now as of today available to everybody

[01:40:58.120 --> 01:41:02.360]   gossip it is not drama it is not third-hand accounts it is not sort of
[01:41:04.280 --> 01:41:09.240]   weird looking in on things is an actual apple engineer who was responsible for helping to make
[01:41:09.240 --> 01:41:14.440]   safari and webkit and who built pretty much by his damn self the original keyboard on the
[01:41:14.440 --> 01:41:19.480]   original iphone and it's a fascinating look a lot of times we hear stories about oh apple's got one
[01:41:19.480 --> 01:41:24.280]   engineer in that project and you're like what no what no it's a billion-dollar company what no
[01:41:24.280 --> 01:41:29.080]   no it really is one engineer working on this piece of software that is going to be used by a
[01:41:29.080 --> 01:41:34.760]   billion people eventually and sort of his thoughts on how how that happens how they get there
[01:41:34.760 --> 01:41:43.080]   and how they use this iterative relentless try it out test it demo it dog food it refine it
[01:41:43.080 --> 01:41:47.400]   because eventually you'll be demonstrating it to scott forestall and then steve jobs it
