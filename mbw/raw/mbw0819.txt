[00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:08.360]   It's one of those slow days just before the World Wide
[00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:09.260]   Developers Conference.
[00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:11.720]   We'll talk about some rumors about what Apple might be
[00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:15.720]   announcing June 6th at WWDC.
[00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:20.120]   Also some changes in Apple management.
[00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:24.960]   Ode to Tim Cook and Farewell to one of the greats
[00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:25.920]   in the Mac community.
[00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.080]   It's all coming up next on Mac break weekly.

[00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:56.960]   all this month, actually for a couple more weeks.
[00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:00.320]   Anyway, that's Andy Inaco, chortling away in the background.
[00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:01.720]   He will not be at a loss for words
[00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:03.720]   during today's program, hello Andrew.
[00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:07.960]   No, not with that report about rumors backstage
[00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:11.280]   about the development of Apple's AR goggles.
[00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:15.160]   Oh boy, I've got a great feeling about that product.
[00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:16.000]   Well, we're good.
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:16.840]   We're gonna talk about it.
[00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:17.680]   We're gonna talk about it.
[00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:21.200]   Yeah, Renee Richie, YouTube.com/ReneeRitchie.
[00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:22.680]   Hello Renee.
[00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:23.560]   I'm wearing them right now.
[00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:25.280]   Leo, you can't tell because they have a screen on the outside
[00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:26.000]   mirroring my face.
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.160]   I'm wearing them right now.
[00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:29.120]   Also, there's Dub Dub.
[00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:29.600]   Did you fare?
[00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:30.920]   Like they just put out a Dub Dub press release.
[00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:31.800]   So we have a little bit.
[00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:32.520]   Oh, OK.
[00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:35.800]   I'll go run and get that while we say hello to Alex Lindsey,
[00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:37.720]   Office Hours.kolode.
[00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:39.040]   Hello.
[00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:40.240]   Good beer.
[00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:42.480]   Talk a little longer because I'm going to the Apple newsroom.
[00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:44.320]   Right now.
[00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:46.480]   The com/newsroom.
[00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:48.560]   OK, so we're really--
[00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:49.840]   Read between--
[00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:50.720]   Full story.
[00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:51.360]   Here we go.
[00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:54.640]   Between Top Gun and the Bobsboroers movie,
[00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:57.400]   who is OK with being-- suddenly OK with being back
[00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:58.520]   in a movie theater again.
[00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:00.200]   I'm so on the fence.
[00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:02.000]   I'm trying to be good and say no.
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.040]   I shouldn't be back in a theater.
[00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:03.720]   We rented one.
[00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:05.640]   We rented one, which was surprisingly affordable
[00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:06.440]   if you have enough people.
[00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:10.360]   I refuse to be held hostage by Tom Cruise.
[00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:11.680]   I'm going to watch it streaming.
[00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:12.960]   I don't care what he says.
[00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:13.440]   So there.
[00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:16.040]   I would like to be rescued from hostage to--
[00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:18.360]   Because I believe he's the one I can get people that off.
[00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:19.200]   Yeah.
[00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:20.880]   Everything, everywhere, all the time, always.
[00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:22.080]   I forget the exact title of the movie.
[00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:24.080]   But everyone I know tell you, I have to go see that immediately.
[00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:26.040]   Yeah, we also decided not to go to a theater
[00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:26.440]   to see that.
[00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:28.040]   It closed Petaloma last week.
[00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:30.680]   And we'll be watching that on streaming, too.
[00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:32.880]   I have a perfectly good home theater.
[00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:35.080]   I have no desire to go to a movie theater.
[00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:35.640]   Sorry Tom.
[00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:37.280]   Do you have Alex Lindsey sitting on top of your projector
[00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:38.520]   adjusting it for you in real time?
[00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:39.320]   Yes, exactly.
[00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:41.880]   Actually, I did have a team of four people coming
[00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:43.200]   and just a projector.
[00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:45.080]   Because it's very finicky.
[00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:46.480]   It's a short throw projector.
[00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:48.200]   And it's a special screen.
[00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:49.400]   It all has to be just so.
[00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:51.640]   And that was a couple of years ago.
[00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:53.760]   And now it's just all Wauper Jod.
[00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:55.280]   But I just pretend--
[00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:56.080]   I don't know.
[00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:57.280]   But look, in your car, you clean it for the week.
[00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:59.040]   It's all a keystone and messed up.
[00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:02.440]   But honestly, once you get that smoothing turned on,
[00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:03.840]   oh my god, the experience.
[00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:06.400]   Oh, I've never going back to--
[00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:09.600]   I just want to see someone's head smoothing up.
[00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:11.080]   Boom.
[00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:12.400]   Apple's growing up on Facebook.
[00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:15.320]   Roberts kicks off June 6 with keynote address.
[00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:17.800]   Well, there's the first revelation.
[00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:18.600]   We're still--
[00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:20.000]   The Wauper keynote is stunning.
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:20.360]   It's--
[00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:20.880]   Good morning.
[00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:22.600]   They're going to have an event on the same day
[00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:24.320]   and the same time that they have it every year.
[00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:25.160]   Good morning.
[00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:25.800]   Good morning.
[00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:27.320]   Good morning.
[00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:30.400]   10 AM Pacific.
[00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:31.720]   It'll stream on apple.com.
[00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:35.200]   And of course, we'll do our thing here as usual.
[00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:36.160]   That's a Monday.
[00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:38.920]   That is a little bit of a change, is it?
[00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:39.920]   Not for a dump dump.
[00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:40.880]   Dump out recently.
[00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:42.040]   It's the rest that are all Tuesday.
[00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:42.800]   Oh, OK.
[00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:43.320]   OK.
[00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:46.360]   Platforms state of the union follows immediately
[00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:48.800]   after at 1 PM Pacific.
[00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:49.720]   The design awards that--
[00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:50.600]   That's all the good stuff, Leo.
[00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:51.600]   This is always the same.
[00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:53.080]   Platforms state of the union is like the second keynote,
[00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:54.160]   but it's all the good stuff.
[00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:56.560]   It's the technical stuff, yeah.
[00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:58.840]   Yeah, it's Craig Federicki's vice president.
[00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:02.360]   So it's like Stefan and Sebastian, and they come out.
[00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:04.080]   And they tell you about all the--
[00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:06.240]   how the stuff actually works that they just went through
[00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:07.360]   quickly during the main keynote.
[00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:11.920]   Well, I do have a Air Force One's accidental leak last year
[00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:16.720]   on the whiteboard at Apple of top secret features.
[00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:17.760]   Think it's a double bluff?
[00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:25.440]   For WWDC 22, haircut reminder, use front-facing camera.
[00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:29.120]   Personal hologram, video call, stand-in.
[00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:30.960]   I wonder if they're intentionally
[00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:34.640]   burying some actual tidbits in here.
[00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:37.520]   Dog airpods-- do we call them airbuds?
[00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:39.560]   Does Siri speak dog?
[00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:41.440]   Autonomous phone retrieval.
[00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:43.160]   Find me?
[00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:44.640]   Personal stylist features.
[00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:45.960]   Scroll to recharge.
[00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:47.120]   That's my favorite.
[00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:49.720]   And then Mac OS brainstorming.
[00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:50.760]   Mac OS Zeppelin.
[00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:52.840]   Mac OS Big Fish.
[00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:54.080]   Big fun.
[00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:54.680]   I can't read it.
[00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:55.840]   It's hands in front.
[00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:57.040]   Upgrades to health.
[00:05:57.040 --> 00:05:59.280]   It's getting hard to read here.
[00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:01.840]   Obviously, this is a joke, yeah?
[00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:05.200]   Well, the thing is remember, for years and years and years,
[00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:08.480]   Steve Jobs during his keynote was like secretly dog fooding
[00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:09.080]   keynote.
[00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:09.880]   Right.
[00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:11.200]   It wasn't announced.
[00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:14.680]   Maybe they're developing a whiteboard or something.
[00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:16.360]   And we're dog fooding the dog butt.
[00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:17.360]   We're feeding the dog food.
[00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:19.360]   Yeah.
[00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:20.360]   I wouldn't pass it.
[00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:21.360]   Clever.
[00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:23.120]   The rumor, one rumor we did here is
[00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:26.440]   that Apple is going to put a screen on the front of the A.
[00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:28.720]   So first of all, credible that they
[00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:31.320]   would say something next week about the AR goggles.
[00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:33.800]   Is that reasonable?
[00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:34.560]   I'm voting.
[00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:36.000]   AR kit.
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:37.480]   The AR kit, yeah.
[00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:38.280]   I would be surprised.
[00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:39.480]   No hardware.
[00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:42.880]   Even though Mark Gurman says they showed them
[00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:45.880]   to the board of directors last week.
[00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:48.080]   But they had iPhones for like a year before they announced.
[00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:51.240]   And even Eric Schmidt got an iPhone before they were publicly
[00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:51.640]   announced.
[00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:53.240]   OK.
[00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:56.000]   Boy, you're really raining on my parade today.
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:56.880]   I'm sorry, Leo.
[00:06:56.880 --> 00:06:57.760]   I apologize.
[00:06:57.760 --> 00:06:59.240]   Will they have a surenean on the front?
[00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:01.040]   The Apple car will be on stage.
[00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:06.680]   The rumor was that there will be 14--
[00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:08.000]   was it 14 screen?
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:08.680]   --to cameras.
[00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:09.440]   Camera cameras.
[00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:11.960]   Camera cameras facing out and facing in.
[00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:12.960]   Yeah.
[00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:16.000]   Partly so that-- so well, there was a conversation,
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.040]   a very rational conversation happening
[00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:19.400]   amongst all designers as hard.
[00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:21.600]   We're saying, yeah, but one of the big stumbling blocks
[00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:25.120]   is that when you're wearing them outside or in a group of people,
[00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:26.760]   like you're wearing these blindfolds,
[00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:28.080]   and no one can interact with you.
[00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:29.280]   And rather than the--
[00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:31.880]   and according to the story, rather than the saying, yeah,
[00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:32.240]   you're right.
[00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:33.840]   I guess this is kind of a dumb idea.
[00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:35.400]   And we need to sort of navigate around that.
[00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:36.800]   They said, no problem.
[00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:37.320]   We'll have--
[00:07:37.320 --> 00:07:38.160]   --of course, we'll have--
[00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:42.000]   --out green facing LCD screens with video images of your eyes.
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:43.560]   So you can still have that icon back.
[00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:45.320]   Not the least big creepy.
[00:07:45.320 --> 00:07:46.080]   I know.
[00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:47.080]   Is that what they're not?
[00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:49.800]   If they get late and see with the blinking, just be right.
[00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:52.440]   Are they saying they're putting LCDs on the--
[00:07:52.440 --> 00:07:54.200]   No, there's a rumor.
[00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:57.120]   There's a story in a newsletter called Puck
[00:07:57.120 --> 00:08:00.320]   that wasn't familiar with that had a long, long history
[00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:03.040]   of the development of AR glasses.
[00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:05.240]   9 to 5 Mac and a whole bunch of other--
[00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:07.120]   --a couple others, like summarized it--
[00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:07.640]   --alumorized it--
[00:08:07.640 --> 00:08:08.560]   --expanded upon it.
[00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:09.600]   Yeah.
[00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:12.480]   And so it basically-- the storyline
[00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:17.160]   is that it's been-- it's been very active for five or six years.
[00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:19.440]   There have been fights between the design--
[00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:22.120]   the advanced technology group, like the research people
[00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:24.680]   and the design people with Johnny Ive, at that point,
[00:08:24.680 --> 00:08:27.400]   being the head of user interface and basically anything
[00:08:27.400 --> 00:08:30.000]   that's supposed to be pretty, making all the final decisions.
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:35.080]   And as a result, again, it's bad to make any judgment
[00:08:35.080 --> 00:08:39.320]   about something Apple hasn't announced based on a news story
[00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:41.800]   that you don't know exactly where it's coming from.
[00:08:41.800 --> 00:08:44.000]   But there's nothing revelatory about it
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:47.120]   that would get one excited about what's happening in this--
[00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:49.880]   Well, the reason I asked is that I did read the article,
[00:08:49.880 --> 00:08:51.480]   and I thought that when they were talking about it--
[00:08:51.480 --> 00:08:55.160]   I know that the reason that you want inward cameras--
[00:08:55.160 --> 00:08:58.040]   --not so much to put your eyes on the front, which
[00:08:58.040 --> 00:08:59.680]   would be super weird--
[00:08:59.680 --> 00:09:02.560]   it is to get all the expressions from your eyes,
[00:09:02.560 --> 00:09:06.720]   because they want to put them into emojis or to--
[00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:07.960]   I don't know about Apple once--
[00:09:07.960 --> 00:09:09.920]   where Apple wants to put them, but other people
[00:09:09.920 --> 00:09:11.720]   want to track your eye and pocket--
[00:09:11.720 --> 00:09:12.560]   If you ever want to be--
[00:09:12.560 --> 00:09:13.400]   --because the super--
[00:09:13.400 --> 00:09:14.240]   --because the column in Lord of the Rings
[00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:16.080]   would be very handy as well.
[00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:16.580]   Yeah.
[00:09:16.580 --> 00:09:17.080]   Yeah.
[00:09:17.080 --> 00:09:17.580]   Yeah.
[00:09:17.580 --> 00:09:19.500]   The interesting thing is there was also a rumor about Eink
[00:09:19.500 --> 00:09:21.720]   displays on the outside of a folding Apple phone.
[00:09:21.720 --> 00:09:23.280]   So maybe they're the same rumor, and there'll
[00:09:23.280 --> 00:09:25.840]   be an Eink display on the outside of the VR headset
[00:09:25.840 --> 00:09:28.080]   that'll update your facial expressions excruciatingly
[00:09:28.080 --> 00:09:28.720]   slowly.
[00:09:28.720 --> 00:09:31.600]   [GRUNTING]
[00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:35.800]   So mostly you can get your eyes looking like death
[00:09:35.800 --> 00:09:38.200]   of the endless and the sandman.
[00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:39.720]   It was reported previously though.
[00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:43.080]   Alex Heath, when he was reporting on it,
[00:09:43.080 --> 00:09:44.680]   I forget, he moves around so much.
[00:09:44.680 --> 00:09:46.040]   He might have been a business insider,
[00:09:46.040 --> 00:09:47.440]   he might have been at Verge, might have been at CNBC.
[00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:49.200]   He gets around that there were external displays
[00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:51.000]   and nobody could figure out what they were for.
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.000]   And some people thought they would show you charging status
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.360]   while the headset was off or show you notifications
[00:09:55.360 --> 00:09:56.760]   while the headset was off.
[00:09:56.760 --> 00:09:58.480]   But you can just see a meeting somewhere
[00:09:58.480 --> 00:10:00.800]   with some people going, now they're not human enough.
[00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:03.080]   You've got to be able to see what the world is outside you
[00:10:03.080 --> 00:10:04.800]   and the world's got to see what's inside you.
[00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:07.400]   So all we do is make a virtual glass between the two
[00:10:07.400 --> 00:10:08.480]   and then it'll be perfect.
[00:10:08.480 --> 00:10:10.880]   They'll see your eyes walk and you'll see their face walk.
[00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:11.600]   It is kind of weird.
[00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:14.280]   In the new arc, in the quests, they have outward--
[00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:16.920]   and you feel like you're in the Lord of the Rings.
[00:10:16.920 --> 00:10:18.800]   It's like when you put the ring on.
[00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:20.800]   It's like, does everything's kind of like washy and black
[00:10:20.800 --> 00:10:23.200]   and white, and you can see out into it.
[00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:24.240]   But it's very--
[00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:25.120]   Yeah, it's very rare.
[00:10:25.120 --> 00:10:27.680]   It's very rare, the world-like.
[00:10:27.680 --> 00:10:32.120]   But I think that the thing that is important as we read all
[00:10:32.120 --> 00:10:34.160]   of these things is that I've worked in and out
[00:10:34.160 --> 00:10:38.240]   of the development of a lot of these headsets, not apples.
[00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:39.480]   I don't have any idea what they're doing.
[00:10:39.480 --> 00:10:42.680]   But this is really hard.
[00:10:42.680 --> 00:10:45.360]   It is what they're trying to do and what everyone's trying
[00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:49.160]   to do is taking billions and billions of dollars
[00:10:49.160 --> 00:10:49.760]   of development.
[00:10:49.760 --> 00:10:52.960]   And most people have had some version of a dead end.
[00:10:52.960 --> 00:10:55.000]   And it's really, really hard to do.
[00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.000]   And I think that most people know that at some point,
[00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:58.520]   it's going to be pretty interesting.
[00:10:58.520 --> 00:10:59.600]   It depends on the--
[00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:01.480]   I think that Apple's probably going to lean more towards the
[00:11:01.480 --> 00:11:04.320]   Google side of things than the Facebook side.
[00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:05.920]   The Facebook side is kind of like, we want to put you in this
[00:11:05.920 --> 00:11:07.720]   and have you stay there forever.
[00:11:07.720 --> 00:11:10.280]   The Google side is more of like, this is a momentary
[00:11:10.280 --> 00:11:11.480]   experience.
[00:11:11.480 --> 00:11:13.560]   You know that you're going to put it on and experience
[00:11:13.560 --> 00:11:15.640]   something and then take it off and go back to what you're
[00:11:15.640 --> 00:11:16.000]   doing.
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.600]   And I think that Apple, my guess is that it's going to
[00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:20.360]   probably go more in the--
[00:11:20.360 --> 00:11:23.240]   you're going to put it on as an add-on to other experiences
[00:11:23.240 --> 00:11:26.280]   as opposed to it's where you're going to dwell, which is, I
[00:11:26.280 --> 00:11:29.920]   think, Facebook is going more towards the dwell.
[00:11:29.920 --> 00:11:31.400]   It's hard to say.
[00:11:31.400 --> 00:11:33.960]   Again, we're only going from rumors, but mostly we're
[00:11:33.960 --> 00:11:39.560]   talking-- the designs we've been seeing so far, point to
[00:11:39.560 --> 00:11:44.080]   fully immersive VR, or maybe something that is kind of like
[00:11:44.080 --> 00:11:48.040]   what the Oculus does where much, much better 4K cameras are
[00:11:48.040 --> 00:11:50.640]   giving you live video of what you would be seeing if you did
[00:11:50.640 --> 00:11:52.720]   not have this thing in front of your face.
[00:11:52.720 --> 00:11:55.000]   I mean, the question for me is that there are companies that
[00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:56.880]   are-- it is hot, hot, hot development.
[00:11:56.880 --> 00:12:00.200]   Qualcomm has samples of what they're working on.
[00:12:00.200 --> 00:12:02.680]   Many other companies have production samples of what
[00:12:02.680 --> 00:12:03.680]   they want to aim for.
[00:12:03.680 --> 00:12:07.240]   And they're all aiming for enterprise, government,
[00:12:07.240 --> 00:12:10.040]   military, health care, factories.
[00:12:10.040 --> 00:12:13.440]   It's a great, great solution that companies are actually
[00:12:13.440 --> 00:12:19.600]   buying for things like doing a check out of an airplane
[00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:21.760]   before flight where there's a immense list--
[00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:24.680]   there's a big book of checklists of maintenance things that
[00:12:24.680 --> 00:12:25.680]   have to be done.
[00:12:25.680 --> 00:12:28.560]   And the ability to simply have-- even it costs $3,000 to have
[00:12:28.560 --> 00:12:31.360]   this thing on the worker's face, if that allows them to
[00:12:31.360 --> 00:12:34.440]   process this checklist much, much faster and get that
[00:12:34.440 --> 00:12:37.000]   paperwork processed much, much faster because it's being
[00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.840]   checked off as they're doing it, that's worth the money.
[00:12:39.840 --> 00:12:45.480]   The worry that I have is that if Apple is aiming that
[00:12:45.480 --> 00:12:49.380]   towards a real consumer experience, they will be
[00:12:49.380 --> 00:12:52.400]   doing something that goes beyond gaming.
[00:12:52.400 --> 00:12:55.040]   They will be trying something that's unprecedented.
[00:12:55.040 --> 00:12:59.080]   Apple's good at that, but let's just acknowledge that, as you
[00:12:59.080 --> 00:13:01.120]   say, Alex, it's very, very difficult and they'll be doing
[00:13:01.120 --> 00:13:02.680]   something that's unprecedented.
[00:13:02.680 --> 00:13:05.240]   I think that it's going to also be high-end consumer.
[00:13:05.240 --> 00:13:10.080]   I think that if this headset, if it exists, comes out at
[00:13:10.080 --> 00:13:12.520]   less than $3,000, I'll be pretty amazed.
[00:13:12.520 --> 00:13:14.520]   I think it's going to be $3,000 to $5,000.
[00:13:14.520 --> 00:13:16.040]   It's $3,500.
[00:13:16.040 --> 00:13:18.760]   For this developer edition.
[00:13:18.760 --> 00:13:20.560]   They're going to call the developer edition and then
[00:13:20.560 --> 00:13:22.960]   they're going to sell.
[00:13:22.960 --> 00:13:24.760]   There was apparently a big argument about the battery life
[00:13:24.760 --> 00:13:26.320]   too, where some people were saying they wanted to have
[00:13:26.320 --> 00:13:27.240]   recharge--
[00:13:27.240 --> 00:13:29.560]   changeable batteries, user-changeable batteries, so
[00:13:29.560 --> 00:13:31.600]   people could wear it for eight hours and other people
[00:13:31.600 --> 00:13:32.720]   saying, we're not Facebook.
[00:13:32.720 --> 00:13:34.520]   We don't want to create an alternate world for people.
[00:13:34.520 --> 00:13:35.480]   We don't want them to live in this.
[00:13:35.480 --> 00:13:37.760]   We want them to use it like an Apple TV, put on something
[00:13:37.760 --> 00:13:38.960]   fun, and then get out.
[00:13:38.960 --> 00:13:41.560]   So if the battery has to be recharged after two hours or
[00:13:41.560 --> 00:13:42.880]   three hours, that's fun.
[00:13:42.880 --> 00:13:45.120]   That's actually played better for their health.
[00:13:45.120 --> 00:13:48.000]   And it sounds like that's the group that's winning right now.
[00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:49.000]   Yeah.
[00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:51.440]   As well as the idea of, do we have all the processing and all
[00:13:51.440 --> 00:13:54.320]   the battery on board, or do we have a communicating with a
[00:13:54.320 --> 00:13:57.760]   companion device or a phone to get to share some of the
[00:13:57.760 --> 00:13:58.800]   processing power?
[00:13:58.800 --> 00:14:01.960]   And that's another idea where it seems as though no, we want
[00:14:01.960 --> 00:14:04.920]   this to be an entirely self-contained device that doesn't
[00:14:04.920 --> 00:14:07.240]   like an Apple watch that doesn't necessarily require an
[00:14:07.240 --> 00:14:09.680]   external device to function at all, which is another thing
[00:14:09.680 --> 00:14:11.120]   that's, again, it's interesting.
[00:14:11.120 --> 00:14:13.280]   There's no right or wrong way to do it.
[00:14:13.280 --> 00:14:16.560]   But when you have a device that can only be used for an
[00:14:16.560 --> 00:14:19.440]   hour and a half or two hours at a time, you are absolutely
[00:14:19.440 --> 00:14:22.600]   doing that because you have an idea of how you're going to be
[00:14:22.600 --> 00:14:25.280]   explaining this to potential customers.
[00:14:25.280 --> 00:14:27.920]   And those customers, the use case is being, no, that's
[00:14:27.920 --> 00:14:28.920]   perfectly fine.
[00:14:28.920 --> 00:14:31.480]   We're going to have a cart where people, when they go on to
[00:14:31.480 --> 00:14:33.280]   the flight deck, they grab a pair of goggles off the
[00:14:33.280 --> 00:14:34.280]   charging cart.
[00:14:34.280 --> 00:14:35.960]   And then after they do their hours worth of worth, they come
[00:14:35.960 --> 00:14:38.160]   back off the flight line and they drop those goggles right
[00:14:38.160 --> 00:14:39.360]   back in the cart, for instance.
[00:14:39.360 --> 00:14:42.400]   Well, and I had like WWD 2017 and they had this whole
[00:14:42.400 --> 00:14:44.840]   announcement with Valve, and Valve was gearing up to do all
[00:14:44.840 --> 00:14:46.000]   this VR stuff with Apple.
[00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.520]   And then Johnny apparently walks in and says, no, no, no,
[00:14:48.520 --> 00:14:50.000]   we're not going to have an external box.
[00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:51.400]   We're not going to have anything where you have to wear
[00:14:51.400 --> 00:14:52.560]   goggles and they connect.
[00:14:52.560 --> 00:14:53.760]   And that was canceled.
[00:14:53.760 --> 00:14:55.760]   And then Valve went away and then all that stuff just
[00:14:55.760 --> 00:14:57.480]   died and they had to reboot basically.
[00:14:57.480 --> 00:15:01.440]   And don't forget the Army Hollow Lens deal, which has gone
[00:15:01.440 --> 00:15:05.840]   belly up, by the way, $22 billion.
[00:15:05.840 --> 00:15:08.880]   And already they're saying no soldier in the field's ever
[00:15:08.880 --> 00:15:10.560]   wanted to risk his life with this thing.
[00:15:10.560 --> 00:15:13.760]   By the way, this is the Facebook prototype from a couple
[00:15:13.760 --> 00:15:16.360]   of years ago.
[00:15:16.360 --> 00:15:18.960]   Not at all creepy.
[00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:20.560]   Remember Mark walking down the stage.
[00:15:20.560 --> 00:15:26.040]   Being seen on a screen in front, Facebook apparently has
[00:15:26.040 --> 00:15:27.680]   been working on this for a while.
[00:15:27.680 --> 00:15:30.840]   So maybe that's where the rumor comes, or maybe Apple
[00:15:30.840 --> 00:15:32.400]   stealing a page from Facebook.
[00:15:32.400 --> 00:15:32.960]   Go ahead, Renee.
[00:15:32.960 --> 00:15:34.080]   They're going to try everything.
[00:15:34.080 --> 00:15:34.760]   Yeah.
[00:15:34.760 --> 00:15:35.760]   Yeah, I mean, that's the thing.
[00:15:35.760 --> 00:15:37.160]   I mean, doesn't mean anything.
[00:15:37.160 --> 00:15:38.880]   Yeah, I'm sure there's--
[00:15:38.880 --> 00:15:41.040]   I'm sure they have ones with Googly eyes on them.
[00:15:41.040 --> 00:15:44.080]   And let's see if this works.
[00:15:44.080 --> 00:15:45.600]   So yeah, I think that--
[00:15:45.600 --> 00:15:48.080]   I still think that one of the advantages that Apple, I
[00:15:48.080 --> 00:15:49.960]   think we're going to see take advantage of is the fact that
[00:15:49.960 --> 00:15:51.640]   they have a larger ecosystem.
[00:15:51.640 --> 00:15:54.080]   So a lot of the AR kit stuff that's been built.
[00:15:54.080 --> 00:16:00.840]   I still think that the office tools will get USDZ six months
[00:16:00.840 --> 00:16:03.120]   to a year before the headset comes out.
[00:16:03.120 --> 00:16:07.440]   Because the demand for building 3D models will go up
[00:16:07.440 --> 00:16:09.480]   dramatically to USDZ.
[00:16:09.480 --> 00:16:14.120]   So if you release keynote, for instance, with USDZ,
[00:16:14.120 --> 00:16:16.120]   suddenly there's going to be thousands and thousands
[00:16:16.120 --> 00:16:18.320]   of objects built for keynote.
[00:16:18.320 --> 00:16:22.400]   Because it's-- and they'll be sold at $10 for $25 or whatever.
[00:16:22.400 --> 00:16:26.960]   But that's going to generate this huge amount of content
[00:16:26.960 --> 00:16:29.720]   that's much easier to manage and then put into the goggles.
[00:16:29.720 --> 00:16:32.640]   This is something that's the kind of platform experience
[00:16:32.640 --> 00:16:35.800]   that would be very difficult for competitors to build.
[00:16:35.800 --> 00:16:37.600]   And it also probably means the USDZ becomes--
[00:16:37.600 --> 00:16:41.320]   that no one has any idea until we get a million of them
[00:16:41.320 --> 00:16:44.320]   out there and people are using them what people are going to want.
[00:16:44.320 --> 00:16:47.160]   They may, in fact, not want 3D models floating in space.
[00:16:47.160 --> 00:16:48.480]   They may want plain text.
[00:16:48.480 --> 00:16:51.560]   It's unknown until you get a lot of people using it.
[00:16:51.560 --> 00:16:54.240]   Well, that's why Enterprise is such a great fit
[00:16:54.240 --> 00:16:55.440]   for these goggles.
[00:16:55.440 --> 00:16:59.480]   Again, if your job is to deal with clients on,
[00:16:59.480 --> 00:17:02.000]   here's the-- you gave us a million dollars
[00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:06.040]   to determine the feasibility of building this widget for you
[00:17:06.040 --> 00:17:09.400]   so that so that you can post-- you can install them
[00:17:09.400 --> 00:17:12.120]   in existing engines and get another 10 years of service
[00:17:12.120 --> 00:17:13.000]   life off of something.
[00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:15.280]   That's worth $3,000 a unit to have 10 of them
[00:17:15.280 --> 00:17:16.920]   so that when you bring the client in,
[00:17:16.920 --> 00:17:19.360]   you can really show them what you're going for.
[00:17:19.360 --> 00:17:22.400]   I think any company that tries to say, here's $3,000
[00:17:22.400 --> 00:17:25.840]   and now you can have a triceratops on your desk.
[00:17:25.840 --> 00:17:27.560]   It's like, OK, but how does that make me money
[00:17:27.560 --> 00:17:29.280]   or justify a $3,000 toy?
[00:17:29.280 --> 00:17:32.160]   Well, like in Amazon, if you get to the right object,
[00:17:32.160 --> 00:17:33.320]   it's not happening everywhere.
[00:17:33.320 --> 00:17:35.960]   But on Amazon, I was looking for a new TV stand
[00:17:35.960 --> 00:17:38.280]   underneath my TV and it popped up and said,
[00:17:38.280 --> 00:17:39.360]   would you like to see it in your room?
[00:17:39.360 --> 00:17:41.280]   And I hit it and there it is.
[00:17:41.280 --> 00:17:42.600]   And I decided I didn't want that one.
[00:17:42.600 --> 00:17:44.520]   But the thing is, is that it--
[00:17:44.520 --> 00:17:46.720]   but that was really valuable to me as a user
[00:17:46.720 --> 00:17:49.440]   because I was able to see that this was a little too wide
[00:17:49.440 --> 00:17:51.680]   and a little too high and only made possible
[00:17:51.680 --> 00:17:53.680]   because the LiDAR is super accurate
[00:17:53.680 --> 00:17:57.160]   and it was able to place it exactly into where it needed
[00:17:57.160 --> 00:17:59.600]   to be and I could see the lighting, the color,
[00:17:59.600 --> 00:18:00.920]   everything size.
[00:18:00.920 --> 00:18:03.080]   And that's where I think we're going to see--
[00:18:03.080 --> 00:18:05.560]   again, it's not a matter of having a triceratops,
[00:18:05.560 --> 00:18:07.360]   although for education that might be useful.
[00:18:07.360 --> 00:18:13.200]   But the ability to see things,
[00:18:13.200 --> 00:18:16.160]   pre-vis things that you possibly want to use
[00:18:16.160 --> 00:18:19.360]   is I think going to be a big part of what a lot of retailers
[00:18:19.360 --> 00:18:20.360]   want to do.
[00:18:20.360 --> 00:18:23.240]   My barely educated guess is that first,
[00:18:23.240 --> 00:18:24.440]   it's going to be an only Apple product
[00:18:24.440 --> 00:18:25.800]   because that's what they do.
[00:18:25.800 --> 00:18:27.600]   They have limited resources even though they're a trillion
[00:18:27.600 --> 00:18:29.280]   dollar company and they make big bets
[00:18:29.280 --> 00:18:31.160]   and they're going to want to do something that shows off
[00:18:31.160 --> 00:18:33.680]   things that only Apple can do, which is usually integration
[00:18:33.680 --> 00:18:37.520]   with an M3 class processor and a special graphics unit
[00:18:37.520 --> 00:18:39.000]   just for this machine.
[00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:41.080]   But then also they'll follow the Apple TV model.
[00:18:41.080 --> 00:18:44.480]   My very uneducated guess is that whatever we do in the Apple
[00:18:44.480 --> 00:18:47.000]   TV today from Fitness Plus to watching movies,
[00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:49.160]   all the share play stuff now too, which is collaborative.
[00:18:49.160 --> 00:18:51.280]   You'll be able to sit with your Memoji next to Andy
[00:18:51.280 --> 00:18:54.240]   and Alex and Leo's Memoji and watch that movie without having
[00:18:54.240 --> 00:18:57.040]   to go to the iMacs and they'll have all of those features.
[00:18:57.040 --> 00:19:01.320]   And yes, they'll sign big deals with Boeing or American
[00:19:01.320 --> 00:19:02.600]   Airlines, just something and have those.
[00:19:02.600 --> 00:19:04.920]   The same way they do that with the iPad and the iPhone today,
[00:19:04.920 --> 00:19:07.360]   but their end goal is going to be a mainstream consumer product,
[00:19:07.360 --> 00:19:10.160]   not at $3,000, but at like $1,000.
[00:19:10.160 --> 00:19:13.760]   They'd rather a single person pay $1,000 for an Apple VR
[00:19:13.760 --> 00:19:16.760]   headset than a family pay $200 for an Apple TV box.
[00:19:16.760 --> 00:19:18.240]   That's a huge upgrade for them.
[00:19:18.240 --> 00:19:19.720]   So my guess is that's the way they're going.
[00:19:19.720 --> 00:19:22.440]   It also be why Apple-- and this is the Puck story
[00:19:22.440 --> 00:19:23.560]   you were talking about.
[00:19:23.560 --> 00:19:25.560]   Andy Puck.News is a new--
[00:19:25.560 --> 00:19:29.240]   really good, by the way, publication I subscribed to it
[00:19:29.240 --> 00:19:30.840]   when the fair Sunday went over there.
[00:19:30.840 --> 00:19:33.120]   But a lot of good people, Dylan Byers,
[00:19:33.120 --> 00:19:35.480]   who is very well connected, is the one who suggested
[00:19:35.480 --> 00:19:39.640]   that EA has been in play and that Disney, Apple,
[00:19:39.640 --> 00:19:42.120]   and Amazon all are bidding.
[00:19:42.120 --> 00:19:43.840]   And at first, I thought, why would Apple
[00:19:43.840 --> 00:19:45.600]   want a game company like EA?
[00:19:45.600 --> 00:19:47.400]   I mean, that's EA sports.
[00:19:47.400 --> 00:19:50.640]   It's not-- it wouldn't be for arcade.
[00:19:50.640 --> 00:19:51.760]   But on the other hand, maybe there
[00:19:51.760 --> 00:19:54.120]   be some skills and even some technology that
[00:19:54.120 --> 00:19:55.920]   would make sense in an AR world.
[00:19:55.920 --> 00:19:58.200]   And they have purchases.
[00:19:58.200 --> 00:20:00.880]   Yeah, I mean, you look at-- Roba Recall
[00:20:00.880 --> 00:20:03.720]   is probably still the best game that was built for the Oculus.
[00:20:03.720 --> 00:20:09.280]   And it's the kind of thing that EA knows how to do really well.
[00:20:09.280 --> 00:20:11.520]   It's more than just putting 3D objects in there.
[00:20:11.520 --> 00:20:13.440]   It is understanding game design and process.
[00:20:13.440 --> 00:20:14.600]   And that's going to be--
[00:20:14.600 --> 00:20:16.480]   Yeah, they need that expertise.
[00:20:16.480 --> 00:20:18.400]   And they probably don't have that expertise.
[00:20:18.400 --> 00:20:20.000]   Well, that's why Microsoft, of course,
[00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:21.560]   is they purchase game companies.
[00:20:21.560 --> 00:20:22.060]   Exactly.
[00:20:22.060 --> 00:20:23.400]   It's exactly what I get.
[00:20:23.400 --> 00:20:27.200]   Well, Microsoft is different because they own
[00:20:27.200 --> 00:20:31.000]   a legit game platform, one of the most popular game platforms.
[00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:34.480]   When I was reading that idea of lots of people
[00:20:34.480 --> 00:20:39.720]   putting in bids for EA, including Apple, that really got me--
[00:20:39.720 --> 00:20:41.880]   I have a limited imagination to figure out
[00:20:41.880 --> 00:20:43.600]   what Apple would do with EA.
[00:20:43.600 --> 00:20:47.400]   Because it's way too valuable as a content creation studio
[00:20:47.400 --> 00:20:49.760]   to basically say, hey, we've got all this talent for creating
[00:20:49.760 --> 00:20:50.760]   3D experiences.
[00:20:50.760 --> 00:20:52.880]   Let's bring them into Apple.
[00:20:52.880 --> 00:20:55.840]   On the other hand, wow.
[00:20:55.840 --> 00:21:01.640]   It would be like instead of buying movies at festivals,
[00:21:01.640 --> 00:21:06.480]   really trying to have your own MGM and saying,
[00:21:06.480 --> 00:21:09.120]   is Apple going to be willing with their management structure
[00:21:09.120 --> 00:21:12.160]   to say, yes, we will invest $40, $50, $60 million
[00:21:12.160 --> 00:21:15.480]   over three, four, five years on an unproven game concept,
[00:21:15.480 --> 00:21:17.400]   but with a very, very good team behind it,
[00:21:17.400 --> 00:21:22.440]   with the hopes that it will help sell Apple services
[00:21:22.440 --> 00:21:23.920]   and Apple hardware.
[00:21:23.920 --> 00:21:25.160]   It reminds me a little bit--
[00:21:25.160 --> 00:21:27.840]   It reminds me a little bit of the Beats acquisition.
[00:21:27.840 --> 00:21:29.440]   When the Beats acquisition happened,
[00:21:29.440 --> 00:21:31.600]   it was like, what the hell are they thinking?
[00:21:31.600 --> 00:21:32.680]   Do they want headphones?
[00:21:32.680 --> 00:21:34.200]   Maybe they want streaming music?
[00:21:34.200 --> 00:21:35.520]   We learned from Tripp Nichols' book
[00:21:35.520 --> 00:21:38.400]   that, in fact, they already had a streaming music project going
[00:21:38.400 --> 00:21:39.640]   on inside Apple.
[00:21:39.640 --> 00:21:41.000]   And there was a bit of a competition
[00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:43.680]   between the Beats folks and the Apple folks.
[00:21:43.680 --> 00:21:47.000]   The Beats deal was even weirder than this EA deal,
[00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:48.640]   at least with the EA deal.
[00:21:48.640 --> 00:21:50.600]   Did you notice an Easter egg there?
[00:21:50.600 --> 00:21:52.480]   Because they named that product Fuse.
[00:21:52.480 --> 00:21:54.440]   And then if you go back, that was the name of Tony Fidel's
[00:21:54.440 --> 00:21:57.000]   company when they hired him to come in and make the iPod.
[00:21:57.000 --> 00:21:59.040]   And I wonder if that was just a little bit of a--
[00:21:59.040 --> 00:22:00.480]   this is the future of music, buddy.
[00:22:00.480 --> 00:22:01.760]   Yeah.
[00:22:01.760 --> 00:22:03.760]   EA owns FIFA.
[00:22:03.760 --> 00:22:06.160]   It owns Madden.
[00:22:06.160 --> 00:22:07.400]   There's very, very hot things.
[00:22:07.400 --> 00:22:12.040]   Need for speed, battle fields, which is sort of big.
[00:22:12.040 --> 00:22:13.760]   I think it would be one of those things
[00:22:13.760 --> 00:22:16.840]   where, much like the Beats acquisition,
[00:22:16.840 --> 00:22:18.800]   where there's some additional profit
[00:22:18.800 --> 00:22:20.800]   from the headphone business or the game business,
[00:22:20.800 --> 00:22:24.320]   but really the technology underlying it and the team.
[00:22:24.320 --> 00:22:25.320]   That's--
[00:22:25.320 --> 00:22:27.480]   Yeah, and there's not that many--
[00:22:27.480 --> 00:22:28.600]   I mean, Apple makes--
[00:22:28.600 --> 00:22:29.720]   Sorry, I just said--
[00:22:29.720 --> 00:22:32.640]   In the-- a lot of the stuff that's come out,
[00:22:32.640 --> 00:22:36.960]   we're clear that Apple makes a huge amount of money on games.
[00:22:36.960 --> 00:22:37.960]   So it's--
[00:22:37.960 --> 00:22:39.480]   Yeah, I think I have an Xbox.
[00:22:39.480 --> 00:22:40.920]   But the iPhone is still on.
[00:22:40.920 --> 00:22:42.520]   If there's a critique of MacIntosh,
[00:22:42.520 --> 00:22:45.160]   is there not a gaming platform?
[00:22:45.160 --> 00:22:46.120]   Well, but the iPhone is.
[00:22:46.120 --> 00:22:47.080]   And so the--
[00:22:47.080 --> 00:22:51.360]   But I'm saying, if you bought EA, you can insist that all of these--
[00:22:51.360 --> 00:22:53.800]   And by the way, the sports games are very friendly.
[00:22:53.800 --> 00:22:54.920]   They're not shooters.
[00:22:54.920 --> 00:22:57.680]   So you could insist that Madden comes out on a Mac--
[00:22:57.680 --> 00:23:00.520]   But can you just imagine, like, they flip the button on iPad apps
[00:23:00.520 --> 00:23:01.880]   and say you can run on the Mac?
[00:23:01.880 --> 00:23:04.000]   That they're refusing-- everyone is refusing to do that.
[00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:06.400]   But if they flip that button that says this iPad app could run
[00:23:06.400 --> 00:23:08.760]   on the Mac, there'd be a huge amount of games available in--
[00:23:08.760 --> 00:23:10.080]   Yeah, but they're not triple A.
[00:23:10.080 --> 00:23:11.040]   Really big publishers.
[00:23:11.040 --> 00:23:12.240]   Yeah, but they're not triple A.
[00:23:12.240 --> 00:23:13.400]   Some of them are really--
[00:23:13.400 --> 00:23:14.400]   Genshin Impact.
[00:23:14.400 --> 00:23:17.520]   There are some really good titles on the iPad.
[00:23:17.520 --> 00:23:20.240]   But I think that even-- yeah, moving a bunch of the EA stuff
[00:23:20.240 --> 00:23:22.480]   to their-- also, there's just not that many game companies.
[00:23:22.480 --> 00:23:24.240]   If you decide games are important,
[00:23:24.240 --> 00:23:26.080]   it's very expensive to build your own studio.
[00:23:26.080 --> 00:23:26.800]   There's not that many.
[00:23:26.800 --> 00:23:28.440]   There's EA, there's 2K.
[00:23:28.440 --> 00:23:30.840]   And they're going fast.
[00:23:30.840 --> 00:23:36.360]   There's like four or five left that are of any close size to EA.
[00:23:36.360 --> 00:23:38.320]   And no, Google L's is pretty good.
[00:23:38.320 --> 00:23:39.160]   It's really hard.
[00:23:39.160 --> 00:23:41.160]   Disney and Amazon, right?
[00:23:41.160 --> 00:23:42.240]   No, no.
[00:23:42.240 --> 00:23:47.160]   So it's such a secure fit for Disney.
[00:23:47.160 --> 00:23:49.240]   The idea of saying that--
[00:23:49.240 --> 00:23:52.680]   they have coordination amongst every single platform
[00:23:52.680 --> 00:23:54.120]   that they own.
[00:23:54.120 --> 00:23:57.240]   And the ability to simply not contract out a game
[00:23:57.240 --> 00:23:59.000]   to an outside company, but simply say, no, no,
[00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:01.160]   we have our own game studio.
[00:24:01.160 --> 00:24:02.360]   So you will get access.
[00:24:02.360 --> 00:24:05.640]   We will be developing this game and content for that game
[00:24:05.640 --> 00:24:08.640]   so that it synchronizes with things we're doing in the comics,
[00:24:08.640 --> 00:24:11.520]   things we're doing on TV, things we're doing in movies.
[00:24:11.520 --> 00:24:13.920]   I can't imagine Apple outbidding Disney
[00:24:13.920 --> 00:24:16.680]   if they have their sights on the front studio.
[00:24:16.680 --> 00:24:22.560]   Buyer says that EA's market cap, around $36 billion--
[00:24:22.560 --> 00:24:23.640]   That's a chump change.
[00:24:23.640 --> 00:24:25.200]   Yeah, well, it is.
[00:24:25.200 --> 00:24:29.560]   It's less than a third of what Microsoft paid
[00:24:29.560 --> 00:24:30.880]   for Activision Blizzard.
[00:24:30.880 --> 00:24:32.760]   So in a way, it's a deal.
[00:24:32.760 --> 00:24:35.080]   And the thing is, is that just what Andy had just talked
[00:24:35.080 --> 00:24:36.400]   about with Disney would definitely work.
[00:24:36.400 --> 00:24:37.680]   If you look at think about--
[00:24:37.680 --> 00:24:39.480]   there's a lot of the titles that Apple's built that
[00:24:39.480 --> 00:24:42.280]   could be turned into a game that could have AR and VR
[00:24:42.280 --> 00:24:44.160]   potential, could have a lot of those other bits of pieces.
[00:24:44.160 --> 00:24:46.200]   Because the game company's going to bring also
[00:24:46.200 --> 00:24:48.880]   a lot of understanding of 3D pipelines and so on and so forth
[00:24:48.880 --> 00:24:50.440]   that are going to be useful for AR as well.
[00:24:50.440 --> 00:24:51.280]   And here's another one.
[00:24:51.280 --> 00:24:53.960]   What about the car?
[00:24:53.960 --> 00:24:56.280]   Don't you want entertainment in the car?
[00:24:56.280 --> 00:24:57.080]   Well, I don't know.
[00:24:57.080 --> 00:24:59.560]   I think that playing some kind of racing game in the car
[00:24:59.560 --> 00:25:00.360]   would might be dangerous.
[00:25:00.360 --> 00:25:01.640]   That's all I'm saying.
[00:25:01.640 --> 00:25:03.120]   No, no, you're like--
[00:25:03.120 --> 00:25:03.640]   I know.
[00:25:03.640 --> 00:25:04.760]   You think Apple--
[00:25:04.760 --> 00:25:05.280]   Do you think Apple--
[00:25:05.280 --> 00:25:06.480]   Apple car is going to have a steering wheel?
[00:25:06.480 --> 00:25:07.280]   I don't think so.
[00:25:07.280 --> 00:25:08.360]   No, I don't think so.
[00:25:08.360 --> 00:25:09.920]   Also, I'm starting to--
[00:25:09.920 --> 00:25:14.280]   I'm starting to wonder if Apple is as good at integration
[00:25:14.280 --> 00:25:16.920]   as we've often given them credit for us
[00:25:16.920 --> 00:25:18.560]   or as maybe they used to be.
[00:25:18.560 --> 00:25:20.360]   That if they could actually pull that off
[00:25:20.360 --> 00:25:23.560]   where they have a division that will get access to something
[00:25:23.560 --> 00:25:30.560]   as secret as the car division, as other experimental and research
[00:25:30.560 --> 00:25:32.400]   sort of things that they're looking at,
[00:25:32.400 --> 00:25:36.440]   as opposed to those really thick and institutional walls
[00:25:36.440 --> 00:25:39.880]   that they keep between every single product that they don't
[00:25:39.880 --> 00:25:42.160]   want anybody else to know about.
[00:25:42.160 --> 00:25:44.240]   So I don't know.
[00:25:44.240 --> 00:25:50.760]   Wouldn't it be interesting if you bought a autonomous vehicle?
[00:25:50.760 --> 00:25:52.080]   You could not drive.
[00:25:52.080 --> 00:25:54.120]   And inside it, you had a steering wheel
[00:25:54.120 --> 00:25:57.040]   and pedals to play knee for speed.
[00:25:57.040 --> 00:25:57.680]   Wouldn't it be--
[00:25:57.680 --> 00:26:00.320]   Wouldn't actually have one of those full motion--
[00:26:00.320 --> 00:26:02.200]   You could have a box in the back.
[00:26:02.200 --> 00:26:03.640]   It's a full motion system.
[00:26:03.640 --> 00:26:06.200]   You put it all in there and you're like going around it.
[00:26:06.200 --> 00:26:07.960]   No, no, no.
[00:26:07.960 --> 00:26:09.000]   This is an opportunity.
[00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:13.280]   Because you know that there is a federal mandate now
[00:26:13.280 --> 00:26:18.160]   to certify a technology to make sure that a car cannot
[00:26:18.160 --> 00:26:20.600]   be operated by someone who is impaired or drunk.
[00:26:20.600 --> 00:26:25.080]   So what if we just have-- look, until you get to level eight
[00:26:25.080 --> 00:26:28.960]   of Tetris, you cannot start this car.
[00:26:28.960 --> 00:26:29.400]   There you go.
[00:26:29.400 --> 00:26:31.960]   Elon's put games in his car.
[00:26:31.960 --> 00:26:35.000]   My Ford Mustang has some actually decent games.
[00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:39.520]   And I honestly think if you're in the Apple Car Division,
[00:26:39.520 --> 00:26:40.120]   we know this.
[00:26:40.120 --> 00:26:41.480]   We've talked about it before.
[00:26:41.480 --> 00:26:42.880]   You're thinking about, well, what are people
[00:26:42.880 --> 00:26:45.200]   going to be doing inside these living rooms on wheels?
[00:26:45.200 --> 00:26:46.120]   Yeah.
[00:26:46.120 --> 00:26:47.320]   Let's take a little break.
[00:26:47.320 --> 00:26:48.840]   We got lots more to-- no, we don't.
[00:26:48.840 --> 00:26:49.800]   We got nothing more.
[00:26:49.800 --> 00:26:50.760]   Full self-gaming, Leo.
[00:26:50.760 --> 00:26:51.260]   Think about it.
[00:26:51.260 --> 00:26:52.240]   Full self-gaming.
[00:26:52.240 --> 00:26:53.440]   Full self-gaming.
[00:26:53.440 --> 00:26:53.760]   You know what?
[00:26:53.760 --> 00:26:56.200]   I prefer to drive a car and let the car play the game.
[00:26:56.200 --> 00:26:56.800]   How about that?
[00:26:56.800 --> 00:26:57.640]   What do we think?
[00:26:57.640 --> 00:26:58.040]   Yes.
[00:26:58.040 --> 00:26:59.280]   How about a nice game of chess?
[00:26:59.280 --> 00:27:00.640]   Yes.
[00:27:00.640 --> 00:27:04.960]   Do you really want to try to play a game with your two kids
[00:27:04.960 --> 00:27:05.680]   in the backseat?
[00:27:05.680 --> 00:27:06.880]   They would smoke you.
[00:27:06.880 --> 00:27:07.640]   Oh, I don't know.
[00:27:07.640 --> 00:27:09.560]   Please, now you have the excuse of all, like, boy,
[00:27:09.560 --> 00:27:10.840]   I would whip your ass in that game.
[00:27:10.840 --> 00:27:12.600]   But unfortunately, I have Daddy's driving right now.
[00:27:12.600 --> 00:27:14.800]   Daddy's playing Simpsons tapped out at front.
[00:27:14.800 --> 00:27:15.720]   Falcon Punch.
[00:27:15.720 --> 00:27:16.880]   No, no, no, no.
[00:27:16.880 --> 00:27:21.800]   Our show today brought to you by ITProTV.
[00:27:21.800 --> 00:27:24.320]   We talk all the time about what a great place
[00:27:24.320 --> 00:27:28.800]   ITProTV is for anybody looking to get into the IT world.
[00:27:28.800 --> 00:27:30.600]   But what if you're already in the IT world?
[00:27:30.600 --> 00:27:31.960]   What if you're already got a job?
[00:27:31.960 --> 00:27:34.560]   Well, you also have to polish your skills,
[00:27:34.560 --> 00:27:37.160]   acquire new skills, recertify.
[00:27:37.160 --> 00:27:39.440]   Now, as long as you're doing a thought experiment,
[00:27:39.440 --> 00:27:41.360]   what if you have an IT team?
[00:27:41.360 --> 00:27:44.600]   What if your business has a team of IT professionals?
[00:27:44.600 --> 00:27:46.880]   Don't you want them to be doing the same thing,
[00:27:46.880 --> 00:27:51.280]   getting new skills, a re-accrediting, recertifying?
[00:27:51.280 --> 00:27:53.640]   Well, give them ITProTV.
[00:27:53.640 --> 00:27:58.360]   They have a team platform you will love.
[00:27:58.360 --> 00:28:01.440]   More importantly, your employees will use.
[00:28:01.440 --> 00:28:04.120]   And that's really kind of half the game.
[00:28:04.120 --> 00:28:06.920]   More than 80% of users who start a video at ITProTV
[00:28:06.920 --> 00:28:08.640]   finish it because it's fun.
[00:28:08.640 --> 00:28:09.480]   It's engaging.
[00:28:09.480 --> 00:28:12.400]   They've got the best edutainers they call them,
[00:28:12.400 --> 00:28:16.920]   experts in the field, but who are also really, really good
[00:28:16.920 --> 00:28:18.640]   at keeping you engaged.
[00:28:18.640 --> 00:28:21.640]   I think it's their passion, frankly, for what they're teaching.
[00:28:21.640 --> 00:28:24.160]   This will give your team the tools they need
[00:28:24.160 --> 00:28:27.000]   to make your business thrive.
[00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:31.400]   Binge-worthy courses in every aspect of IT.
[00:28:31.400 --> 00:28:33.640]   And of course, because IT is constantly changing,
[00:28:33.640 --> 00:28:35.360]   so is ITProTV.
[00:28:35.360 --> 00:28:37.360]   They have in their beautiful--
[00:28:37.360 --> 00:28:39.360]   and we went out and visited it when they launched
[00:28:39.360 --> 00:28:40.960]   at Gainesville Studio.
[00:28:40.960 --> 00:28:44.240]   They have seven studios creating brand new content.
[00:28:44.240 --> 00:28:44.960]   Why?
[00:28:44.960 --> 00:28:46.560]   Well, the search change, the questions,
[00:28:46.560 --> 00:28:51.160]   change the software updates, the systems upgrade.
[00:28:51.160 --> 00:28:55.480]   Their new cyber threats in ITProTV is always up to date.
[00:28:55.480 --> 00:28:58.480]   Training goes from those studios into their library
[00:28:58.480 --> 00:29:00.480]   within 24 hours.
[00:29:00.480 --> 00:29:03.760]   There are 5,800 hours of on-demand courses
[00:29:03.760 --> 00:29:06.880]   in every aspect of IT, every vendor, every skill,
[00:29:06.880 --> 00:29:08.200]   all in one place.
[00:29:08.200 --> 00:29:12.800]   Microsoft, Cisco, Linux, Apple, Security, Cloud,
[00:29:12.800 --> 00:29:16.880]   Soft Skills 2 from Compliance and Marketing.
[00:29:16.880 --> 00:29:19.240]   You just can't beat ITProTV.
[00:29:19.240 --> 00:29:23.240]   You'll love the interface because they've
[00:29:23.240 --> 00:29:26.600]   got a way for you to track your team's results,
[00:29:26.600 --> 00:29:30.040]   to manage your seats, to assign and unassign team members.
[00:29:30.040 --> 00:29:33.400]   You'll get monthly usage reports, metrics like logins,
[00:29:33.400 --> 00:29:36.200]   viewing time, tracks completed, so you know exactly
[00:29:36.200 --> 00:29:38.000]   how your team is doing.
[00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:40.200]   You can completely customize their assignments,
[00:29:40.200 --> 00:29:43.360]   keep an eye on any individual or any group.
[00:29:43.360 --> 00:29:45.320]   Assignments can be, of course, the full courses,
[00:29:45.320 --> 00:29:47.320]   but you know, all the courses are divided up
[00:29:47.320 --> 00:29:49.120]   in 20 and 30 minute segments.
[00:29:49.120 --> 00:29:51.160]   So you can assign just a segment if you want.
[00:29:51.160 --> 00:29:53.400]   Just brush up on this skill.
[00:29:53.400 --> 00:29:56.160]   You'll get a lot of advanced reporting too in this dashboard,
[00:29:56.160 --> 00:29:58.720]   so you have insight into what's going on with your team
[00:29:58.720 --> 00:30:02.720]   and knowing that you're getting the ROI for ITProTV.
[00:30:02.720 --> 00:30:05.840]   For individuals getting into the IT business,
[00:30:05.840 --> 00:30:08.720]   staying in the IT business, for teams,
[00:30:08.720 --> 00:30:11.200]   ITProTV is the development platform
[00:30:11.200 --> 00:30:13.000]   you need to level up your skills
[00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:14.040]   while enjoying the journey.
[00:30:14.040 --> 00:30:18.480]   For teams of two to 1,000, but volume discount
[00:30:18.480 --> 00:30:19.520]   started five seats.
[00:30:19.520 --> 00:30:24.520]   In fact, 30% discount when you say Macbreak30
[00:30:24.520 --> 00:30:27.320]   to your ITPro account executive, there's the team.
[00:30:27.320 --> 00:30:28.800]   These are such great people.
[00:30:28.800 --> 00:30:30.200]   I love everybody over there.
[00:30:30.200 --> 00:30:35.200]   ITProTV/Macbreak, Whisper Macbreak30
[00:30:35.200 --> 00:30:38.760]   to your account executive for 30% off
[00:30:38.760 --> 00:30:41.120]   or more on a business plan.
[00:30:41.120 --> 00:30:44.720]   Business or individual Macbreak30
[00:30:44.720 --> 00:30:48.960]   at ITProTV/Macbreak, we thank you so much
[00:30:48.960 --> 00:30:49.920]   for supporting Macbreak.
[00:30:49.920 --> 00:30:52.600]   They've been big supporters since they started.
[00:30:52.600 --> 00:30:55.440]   We've been big supporters in theirs, so it's fair.
[00:30:55.440 --> 00:30:58.160]   Losing Ian Goodfellow to DeepMind
[00:30:59.120 --> 00:31:01.200]   is the dumbest thing Apple's ever done.
[00:31:01.200 --> 00:31:03.160]   I don't know if that's pretty high bar.
[00:31:03.160 --> 00:31:06.120]   Tristan Green writing in the next web.
[00:31:06.120 --> 00:31:12.200]   He likens losing Ian Goodfellow to letting Tom Brady
[00:31:12.200 --> 00:31:15.760]   or Michael Jordan leave your team over a disagreement
[00:31:15.760 --> 00:31:18.440]   over how the towels should be folded.
[00:31:18.440 --> 00:31:20.400]   Goodfellow left.
[00:31:20.400 --> 00:31:21.320]   - You got to read his article, right?
[00:31:21.320 --> 00:31:23.320]   - Yeah, goodfellow.
[00:31:23.320 --> 00:31:24.280]   Yeah, that was a good, right?
[00:31:24.280 --> 00:31:25.120]   That got me to read it.
[00:31:25.120 --> 00:31:26.120]   - Yeah, goodfellow.
[00:31:26.120 --> 00:31:27.560]   - You got us, you got us.
[00:31:27.560 --> 00:31:28.640]   But he makes a good point.
[00:31:28.640 --> 00:31:32.400]   Goodfellow, who is a machine learning expert
[00:31:32.400 --> 00:31:37.200]   and one of the developers of a technique called GAN,
[00:31:37.200 --> 00:31:40.360]   generative something, something.
[00:31:40.360 --> 00:31:41.200]   - Adversarial neural network.
[00:31:41.200 --> 00:31:43.840]   - Adversarial neural network, hard to say,
[00:31:43.840 --> 00:31:45.920]   but a very powerful tool.
[00:31:45.920 --> 00:31:48.680]   So he's really one of the leading lights.
[00:31:48.680 --> 00:31:50.000]   - Can I add something quickly there, Leo?
[00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:51.480]   I love GAN so much.
[00:31:51.480 --> 00:31:54.240]   Like you think about it, like you have a Batman neural network
[00:31:54.240 --> 00:31:57.000]   and its job is to defend something like Face ID, for example.
[00:31:57.000 --> 00:31:58.880]   So Batman is there to make sure no one bad gets
[00:31:58.880 --> 00:32:01.280]   into your Face ID, like Andy can't break into my Face ID.
[00:32:01.280 --> 00:32:03.080]   And then you have a Joker neural network
[00:32:03.080 --> 00:32:05.600]   and its whole job is to defeat the Batman network,
[00:32:05.600 --> 00:32:07.600]   to break in and they go back and forth.
[00:32:07.600 --> 00:32:09.800]   And the programmers have no idea what they're doing anymore.
[00:32:09.800 --> 00:32:11.680]   It's not like code, it's like training pets.
[00:32:11.680 --> 00:32:14.080]   And they go back and forth with this Titanic war
[00:32:14.080 --> 00:32:15.480]   in virtual reality.
[00:32:15.480 --> 00:32:16.320]   Well, not even virtual, like it fits.
[00:32:16.320 --> 00:32:17.160]   - They make each other better.
[00:32:17.160 --> 00:32:18.240]   - And they keep making better versions.
[00:32:18.240 --> 00:32:19.080]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:32:19.080 --> 00:32:20.480]   - Yeah, the ones that are bad get destroyed
[00:32:20.480 --> 00:32:21.320]   and the ones that are good.
[00:32:21.320 --> 00:32:22.160]   - No competition works.
[00:32:22.160 --> 00:32:23.000]   - And they grow.
[00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:24.080]   - Yeah, yes.
[00:32:24.080 --> 00:32:24.920]   - It's amazing.
[00:32:24.920 --> 00:32:29.480]   - He actually was at Google, left Google a few years ago
[00:32:29.480 --> 00:32:31.040]   to go to Apple.
[00:32:31.040 --> 00:32:33.640]   But now, partly, I don't know if it's completely,
[00:32:33.640 --> 00:32:35.640]   he did write a note that said,
[00:32:35.640 --> 00:32:37.280]   I don't wanna go back to work.
[00:32:37.280 --> 00:32:38.880]   I like the work from home thing.
[00:32:38.880 --> 00:32:41.420]   But I think there may be other reasons.
[00:32:41.420 --> 00:32:44.480]   But the point of this article,
[00:32:44.480 --> 00:32:47.400]   besides the link, Beatty headline,
[00:32:47.400 --> 00:32:52.120]   is that these people are unique.
[00:32:52.120 --> 00:32:53.640]   They're not interchangeable.
[00:32:53.640 --> 00:32:56.320]   They're a handful of really great people.
[00:32:56.320 --> 00:32:58.560]   - They include his clarification in there
[00:32:58.560 --> 00:33:00.440]   'cause he did post a brief statement afterward.
[00:33:00.440 --> 00:33:02.560]   - It wasn't just about work from home, right?
[00:33:02.560 --> 00:33:05.560]   - Yeah, that was on the list of its grievances.
[00:33:05.560 --> 00:33:06.440]   - Right, right.
[00:33:06.440 --> 00:33:07.960]   Well, but people like that,
[00:33:07.960 --> 00:33:10.640]   I mean, he's moved around before.
[00:33:10.640 --> 00:33:11.640]   - Yeah.
[00:33:11.640 --> 00:33:16.640]   - You go, you're so valuable that it is like Tom Brady.
[00:33:16.640 --> 00:33:20.000]   You know, other teams are bidding big time
[00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:21.880]   for your tensions.
[00:33:21.880 --> 00:33:24.160]   So it's a way to get more money,
[00:33:24.160 --> 00:33:26.720]   get better work and stuff.
[00:33:26.720 --> 00:33:27.560]   - Yeah.
[00:33:27.560 --> 00:33:28.400]   - Yeah, I mean, I think this is gonna be a challenge
[00:33:28.400 --> 00:33:30.480]   for any company trying to bring workers back
[00:33:30.480 --> 00:33:32.200]   is that the most valuable ones
[00:33:32.200 --> 00:33:34.520]   are the ones that have the most leverage.
[00:33:34.520 --> 00:33:37.320]   You know, and they have a unique talent.
[00:33:37.320 --> 00:33:39.160]   They know it and other people know it.
[00:33:39.160 --> 00:33:42.000]   And they get to choose how they want this to look.
[00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:45.280]   And I think companies that try to press down
[00:33:45.280 --> 00:33:46.560]   are gonna lose a lot of talent.
[00:33:46.560 --> 00:33:47.720]   - I think it's happening already.
[00:33:47.720 --> 00:33:48.840]   - It's happening already.
[00:33:48.840 --> 00:33:50.360]   - They've been working from Tahoe for two years
[00:33:50.360 --> 00:33:51.840]   and not gonna come back to the Latino.
[00:33:51.840 --> 00:33:52.680]   - Or Mountain Viewer.
[00:33:52.680 --> 00:33:55.200]   - And in fact, if this may well be the story
[00:33:55.200 --> 00:33:57.200]   of the last few years of Silicon Valley
[00:33:57.200 --> 00:34:00.920]   is the rise in power of engineers.
[00:34:00.920 --> 00:34:02.160]   You know, who can, who are now starting
[00:34:02.160 --> 00:34:03.600]   to dictate their own terms
[00:34:03.600 --> 00:34:06.640]   because there's so few in between is so valuable.
[00:34:06.640 --> 00:34:10.760]   - Yeah, the supply of engineers is so low
[00:34:10.760 --> 00:34:11.960]   compared to the demand.
[00:34:11.960 --> 00:34:12.800]   - Right.
[00:34:12.800 --> 00:34:13.800]   - And the problem is that they're coming,
[00:34:13.800 --> 00:34:16.160]   you know, and this is why we're seeing grow with Google
[00:34:16.160 --> 00:34:19.520]   and we're seeing playgrounds and everything else
[00:34:19.520 --> 00:34:22.640]   is all an attempt to make that pipeline fatter,
[00:34:22.640 --> 00:34:25.000]   you know, and get people in earlier and faster
[00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:28.400]   because, you know, colleges are not pumping out students
[00:34:28.400 --> 00:34:31.040]   that they need, they're not pumping out the quality
[00:34:31.040 --> 00:34:33.840]   or the quantity that is necessary for the industry.
[00:34:33.840 --> 00:34:34.680]   And so.
[00:34:34.680 --> 00:34:35.960]   - Well, even if they were.
[00:34:35.960 --> 00:34:36.800]   - They're asking them.
[00:34:36.800 --> 00:34:40.880]   - Cranking them out as fast as they possibly could.
[00:34:40.880 --> 00:34:42.840]   This is part of the reason there's a supply charge.
[00:34:42.840 --> 00:34:45.200]   Demand is exploding.
[00:34:45.200 --> 00:34:48.320]   - Well, it is, but you know, I think that this is gonna be,
[00:34:48.320 --> 00:34:50.240]   I think that this is gonna have a massive impact
[00:34:50.240 --> 00:34:53.120]   on education because, you know, essentially these companies
[00:34:53.120 --> 00:34:55.000]   because they're so hungry for this,
[00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:57.640]   this gets into, you know, they're just, they're bypassing,
[00:34:57.640 --> 00:35:00.120]   they're gonna bypass all the computer science colleges.
[00:35:00.120 --> 00:35:02.360]   You know, they'll still have their little degrees,
[00:35:02.360 --> 00:35:03.360]   but there's gonna be a huge number.
[00:35:03.360 --> 00:35:04.800]   You're not gonna come out of high school feeling
[00:35:04.800 --> 00:35:06.880]   like you need to go to college.
[00:35:06.880 --> 00:35:08.520]   You know, like there's gonna be programs.
[00:35:08.520 --> 00:35:09.520]   - They don't want the debt, they don't want the delay.
[00:35:09.520 --> 00:35:10.360]   - Right, right.
[00:35:10.360 --> 00:35:12.360]   - They just want, they wanna get you in,
[00:35:12.360 --> 00:35:13.720]   it's like baseball, you know, baseball,
[00:35:13.720 --> 00:35:14.680]   you come out of high school
[00:35:14.680 --> 00:35:15.520]   as you're in the baseball program.
[00:35:15.520 --> 00:35:16.360]   - But let me point out,
[00:35:16.360 --> 00:35:17.800]   football does not have that same model.
[00:35:17.800 --> 00:35:19.880]   They want you to go to college.
[00:35:19.880 --> 00:35:22.240]   There is stuff to be learned in college, the basics.
[00:35:22.240 --> 00:35:23.080]   I mean, they're all for--
[00:35:23.080 --> 00:35:24.200]   - Well, you're not big enough in football.
[00:35:24.200 --> 00:35:25.440]   Like that's why they do that.
[00:35:25.440 --> 00:35:27.320]   It's that you're not strong enough.
[00:35:27.320 --> 00:35:28.160]   - Yeah.
[00:35:28.160 --> 00:35:29.000]   - You'll get hurt.
[00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:29.840]   - Yeah, all right.
[00:35:29.840 --> 00:35:30.680]   - Enough of the sports analogies.
[00:35:30.680 --> 00:35:32.800]   I still think there's a valuable,
[00:35:32.800 --> 00:35:34.040]   your brain isn't big enough.
[00:35:34.040 --> 00:35:35.560]   Getting out of high school,
[00:35:35.560 --> 00:35:38.080]   you're not ready to write GAN, you know, in vent GAN.
[00:35:38.080 --> 00:35:38.920]   I think you still--
[00:35:38.920 --> 00:35:41.160]   - The other pressure, like, for the really talented ones
[00:35:41.160 --> 00:35:42.840]   is that Apple and Google and Facebook
[00:35:42.840 --> 00:35:44.800]   have shown that they will buy your startup in a blink.
[00:35:44.800 --> 00:35:47.720]   And for a lot of them, getting in and getting a salary
[00:35:47.720 --> 00:35:49.160]   with limited upward mobility
[00:35:49.160 --> 00:35:51.200]   is nowhere nearly as profitable or enjoyable
[00:35:51.200 --> 00:35:52.280]   as making a startup,
[00:35:52.280 --> 00:35:53.600]   they literally make startups,
[00:35:53.600 --> 00:35:54.920]   sell them to Google, leave,
[00:35:54.920 --> 00:35:56.680]   make another startup, sell them to Google or Apple,
[00:35:56.680 --> 00:35:59.280]   leave, and they'd run like three, four times.
[00:35:59.280 --> 00:36:01.080]   - I know that someone who sold their company,
[00:36:01.080 --> 00:36:03.000]   they sold three companies to Google.
[00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:05.280]   By being absorbed, they wait two years, they leave,
[00:36:05.280 --> 00:36:06.120]   they go start another one,
[00:36:06.120 --> 00:36:06.960]   they come back and they go again.
[00:36:06.960 --> 00:36:08.320]   - So you'd be nuts to go to Google at high school
[00:36:08.320 --> 00:36:09.160]   or even at a college.
[00:36:09.160 --> 00:36:12.160]   - Well, better to start to companies in low,
[00:36:12.160 --> 00:36:14.200]   especially with more of a bun stock prices.
[00:36:14.200 --> 00:36:16.960]   And all of the big tech companies, stock prices, are now.
[00:36:16.960 --> 00:36:19.440]   - The issue is it's a lot easier to get funding
[00:36:19.440 --> 00:36:21.560]   for your little startup after you worked at Google.
[00:36:21.560 --> 00:36:23.760]   So it's, or Apple, you know, like that,
[00:36:23.760 --> 00:36:26.600]   having that on your LinkedIn makes it a lot easier
[00:36:26.600 --> 00:36:27.440]   to go out and get something.
[00:36:27.440 --> 00:36:29.840]   - I don't know what the optimal path is,
[00:36:29.840 --> 00:36:33.320]   but I'm sure that if you're smart and adept
[00:36:33.320 --> 00:36:37.520]   in computer science and you're a college sophomore right now,
[00:36:37.520 --> 00:36:39.600]   there's a lot of conversation about,
[00:36:39.600 --> 00:36:42.320]   okay, what are the steps now I need to do?
[00:36:42.320 --> 00:36:43.160]   Okay, I need to get--
[00:36:43.160 --> 00:36:44.000]   - You get your internship.
[00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:44.840]   - You get your year or two,
[00:36:44.840 --> 00:36:45.660]   then you spin a hot twist on it.
[00:36:45.660 --> 00:36:46.500]   - Do I need to see a degree?
[00:36:46.500 --> 00:36:47.340]   Do I need a CS degree?
[00:36:47.340 --> 00:36:48.800]   Where should I get the internship?
[00:36:48.800 --> 00:36:49.640]   Where should I figure this out?
[00:36:49.640 --> 00:36:50.480]   - Where should I figure this out?
[00:36:50.480 --> 00:36:51.320]   - Where should I figure this out?
[00:36:51.320 --> 00:36:52.160]   - I'm sure there's a path.
[00:36:52.160 --> 00:36:53.000]   There's probably books about it.
[00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:53.840]   - So look in Valley on HBO,
[00:36:53.840 --> 00:36:54.840]   I figured they gave you a room now.
[00:36:54.840 --> 00:36:55.680]   (laughing)
[00:36:55.680 --> 00:36:57.840]   - Just follow that as a whiteboard.
[00:36:57.840 --> 00:37:00.080]   - And again, the path that Apple's taking,
[00:37:00.080 --> 00:37:02.040]   to be clear is 10 years old.
[00:37:02.040 --> 00:37:04.120]   I mean, that's why Playdowns is so,
[00:37:04.120 --> 00:37:06.880]   like they want you like playing with that stuff early on
[00:37:06.880 --> 00:37:09.080]   and doing those kinds of things so that,
[00:37:09.080 --> 00:37:11.680]   you know, that's when, I mean, when you think about--
[00:37:11.680 --> 00:37:13.640]   - I think the value that is to be.
[00:37:13.640 --> 00:37:14.840]   Because I think there's plenty,
[00:37:14.840 --> 00:37:17.000]   I mean, there's kids doing it regardless, right?
[00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:19.480]   There's kids learning Python and it's great too.
[00:37:19.480 --> 00:37:21.160]   I mean, they're just trying to make it easy though.
[00:37:21.160 --> 00:37:24.000]   The goal is to make it as easy as possible.
[00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:24.840]   - It's pretty easy.
[00:37:24.840 --> 00:37:26.040]   - The goal is to bring around schools
[00:37:26.040 --> 00:37:27.520]   and curriculums to scale it.
[00:37:27.520 --> 00:37:28.520]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:37:28.520 --> 00:37:29.360]   I mean--
[00:37:29.360 --> 00:37:30.440]   - Like to have a curriculum for a school.
[00:37:30.440 --> 00:37:34.160]   - Schools are failing kids right now, so, you know,
[00:37:34.160 --> 00:37:35.200]   kids are doing it on their own.
[00:37:35.200 --> 00:37:36.880]   I think that that's always been that way, right?
[00:37:36.880 --> 00:37:38.320]   The best programmers, I don't know,
[00:37:38.320 --> 00:37:39.920]   we should interview Ian Goodfellow,
[00:37:39.920 --> 00:37:42.480]   but I bet you, he taught himself, right,
[00:37:42.480 --> 00:37:44.040]   in the first and the early days.
[00:37:44.040 --> 00:37:47.040]   - Yeah, I mean, I think that the,
[00:37:47.040 --> 00:37:48.560]   there's a real power getting over the hump.
[00:37:48.560 --> 00:37:51.440]   Like I got over the hump by someone from UNICE's
[00:37:51.440 --> 00:37:55.240]   was teaching in the downstairs of the church
[00:37:55.240 --> 00:37:56.400]   that I went to as a kid.
[00:37:56.400 --> 00:37:59.840]   And I learned basic, and then I taught myself the rest of it.
[00:37:59.840 --> 00:38:02.080]   But I got over the hump of understanding how it worked.
[00:38:02.080 --> 00:38:03.240]   And then I was off to the races.
[00:38:03.240 --> 00:38:05.480]   - Bill Gates' mom had a bake sale to raise money
[00:38:05.480 --> 00:38:07.960]   so they could buy a terminal for a time share
[00:38:07.960 --> 00:38:09.520]   that they put in his school.
[00:38:09.520 --> 00:38:11.320]   And that's how he got into it, right?
[00:38:11.320 --> 00:38:12.240]   - Right.
[00:38:12.240 --> 00:38:15.040]   - So I think it's always been that way.
[00:38:15.040 --> 00:38:19.840]   Google is apparently, I don't know why,
[00:38:19.840 --> 00:38:21.520]   'cause if you had the choice of working for Apple,
[00:38:21.520 --> 00:38:22.840]   or Google, I would work for Apple,
[00:38:22.840 --> 00:38:26.000]   but because Google is not being so adamant
[00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:29.200]   on this return to work policy,
[00:38:29.200 --> 00:38:30.960]   it's not just Ian Goodfellow apparently,
[00:38:30.960 --> 00:38:35.960]   according to Protocol, Google is becoming a hub
[00:38:35.960 --> 00:38:38.600]   for people leaving Apple.
[00:38:38.600 --> 00:38:39.680]   - Apple just delayed again.
[00:38:39.680 --> 00:38:42.760]   So you wonder, yes, part of it is just being an abundance
[00:38:42.760 --> 00:38:45.200]   of caution, but part of it's also like, okay, pause.
[00:38:45.200 --> 00:38:47.320]   - Yeah, there was a lot of people,
[00:38:47.320 --> 00:38:49.880]   I have a lot of friends that are connected on LinkedIn
[00:38:49.880 --> 00:38:51.200]   that suddenly they were all leaving Apple,
[00:38:51.200 --> 00:38:52.320]   and then suddenly the pause happened.
[00:38:52.320 --> 00:38:54.120]   I was like, somebody said, we gotta figure this out
[00:38:54.120 --> 00:38:55.600]   before we keep pushing down.
[00:38:55.600 --> 00:38:56.520]   - It's really interesting.
[00:38:56.520 --> 00:38:59.000]   I mean, it's a complicated calculus,
[00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:00.120]   'cause I mean, of course, sure,
[00:39:00.120 --> 00:39:02.080]   you want the best work environment.
[00:39:02.080 --> 00:39:04.600]   But also, don't you want the best projects,
[00:39:04.600 --> 00:39:06.760]   the most interesting projects to work on,
[00:39:06.760 --> 00:39:08.160]   don't you want the best compensation?
[00:39:08.160 --> 00:39:09.520]   There's a lot of factors.
[00:39:09.520 --> 00:39:11.360]   It was very interesting in the trip, MacBook book.
[00:39:11.360 --> 00:39:13.920]   I think the number one thing I found interesting
[00:39:13.920 --> 00:39:17.840]   was the Apple Car Project was not from Tim Cook
[00:39:17.840 --> 00:39:20.360]   or the executives, it was from the engineers
[00:39:20.360 --> 00:39:21.520]   who were ready to leave Apple
[00:39:21.520 --> 00:39:23.400]   because Tesla was doing more interesting stuff,
[00:39:23.400 --> 00:39:24.640]   and they said, if you want to keep us,
[00:39:24.640 --> 00:39:26.800]   you better have a car project.
[00:39:26.800 --> 00:39:28.280]   Is that how you read it?
[00:39:28.280 --> 00:39:29.280]   Is that how you read it, Renee?
[00:39:29.280 --> 00:39:30.920]   That's how I read it.
[00:39:30.920 --> 00:39:33.200]   - I mean, like, so I wouldn't be careful what I say,
[00:39:33.200 --> 00:39:34.600]   'cause I knew a lot of the people who were involved
[00:39:34.600 --> 00:39:37.120]   in it at the time, but basically,
[00:39:37.120 --> 00:39:38.840]   there's a group of people who want to invent the next thing.
[00:39:38.840 --> 00:39:40.840]   They have very little interest in making the third iPhone,
[00:39:40.840 --> 00:39:43.600]   the fourth iPad, and a lot of them had already left Apple.
[00:39:43.600 --> 00:39:44.600]   And that's like a flow.
[00:39:44.600 --> 00:39:46.680]   People leave Apple, they come back.
[00:39:46.680 --> 00:39:47.640]   They have like sabbaticals.
[00:39:47.640 --> 00:39:48.960]   I think if you come back within two years,
[00:39:48.960 --> 00:39:50.240]   you don't lose your experience.
[00:39:50.240 --> 00:39:51.720]   But when Apple announced this project,
[00:39:51.720 --> 00:39:54.320]   I think it was heavily driven by both Dan Richeo
[00:39:54.320 --> 00:39:57.120]   and Johnny Ives teams, that was new and exciting,
[00:39:57.120 --> 00:39:58.480]   and a bunch of those people came back,
[00:39:58.480 --> 00:39:59.840]   and there was also a bunch of people
[00:39:59.840 --> 00:40:01.560]   on the existing teams like UIKit
[00:40:01.560 --> 00:40:02.880]   and Springboard and all of those
[00:40:02.880 --> 00:40:04.960]   who were being lured away by Titan,
[00:40:04.960 --> 00:40:07.000]   and they managed to flash in the pan,
[00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:07.840]   don't go anywhere.
[00:40:07.840 --> 00:40:09.520]   It's much more important to work on the foundation,
[00:40:09.520 --> 00:40:11.840]   and they're like, "I wanna work on a car!"
[00:40:11.840 --> 00:40:14.000]   And then it's been reset three or four times now,
[00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:16.360]   but there's absolutely people who wanna be at Apple
[00:40:16.360 --> 00:40:17.360]   'cause they wanna change the world,
[00:40:17.360 --> 00:40:19.000]   and I think the next device is gonna do it.
[00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:21.120]   I mean, if I were a AAA programmer,
[00:40:21.120 --> 00:40:23.720]   I would pick the project I wanted to work on
[00:40:23.720 --> 00:40:25.320]   probably more than anything else.
[00:40:25.320 --> 00:40:27.640]   - And I think they kind of also ruined it.
[00:40:27.640 --> 00:40:28.640]   They made it such a big,
[00:40:28.640 --> 00:40:29.480]   I'll just finish this quickly,
[00:40:29.480 --> 00:40:30.840]   but it's such a big deal.
[00:40:30.840 --> 00:40:33.520]   They basically decided to reinvent everything at Apple
[00:40:33.520 --> 00:40:37.240]   from radar to all the C languages,
[00:40:37.240 --> 00:40:40.160]   like this was pre-swift, reinvent everything,
[00:40:40.160 --> 00:40:42.400]   and that was totally beyond scope
[00:40:42.400 --> 00:40:44.160]   for what you needed to do to produce a shipping car
[00:40:44.160 --> 00:40:45.680]   at anything approaching a decade.
[00:40:45.680 --> 00:40:47.760]   And so like unfettered engineering,
[00:40:47.760 --> 00:40:50.200]   future thinking, Tony Stark-Bravato
[00:40:50.200 --> 00:40:51.440]   isn't always the best either.
[00:40:51.440 --> 00:40:54.000]   - Apparently Google is offering free scooters
[00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:57.000]   from no tauties.
[00:40:57.000 --> 00:40:58.360]   They got rid of the total toilet seats,
[00:40:58.360 --> 00:41:00.640]   and this is according to the Verge last month
[00:41:00.640 --> 00:41:03.000]   that Google offers employees free electric scooters
[00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:04.800]   to get them back to the office.
[00:41:04.800 --> 00:41:07.840]   Seems to me it's gonna take more than a free scooter.
[00:41:07.840 --> 00:41:09.360]   You know, you give me some stock options,
[00:41:09.360 --> 00:41:11.760]   I could buy my own freaking scooter.
[00:41:11.760 --> 00:41:13.120]   - Well, they're giving them stock options as well.
[00:41:13.120 --> 00:41:14.320]   - That's more important, yeah.
[00:41:14.320 --> 00:41:16.920]   - And they're even more important perhaps
[00:41:16.920 --> 00:41:20.400]   as it is not having to go into the office.
[00:41:20.400 --> 00:41:21.880]   I think that's a pretty high priority.
[00:41:21.880 --> 00:41:23.760]   I don't wanna go back to, you know,
[00:41:23.760 --> 00:41:26.640]   there's that idiot, you know, Joe keeps coming over
[00:41:26.640 --> 00:41:28.000]   and saying what are you gonna have for lunch?
[00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:29.360]   - Well, I have to go back to, I know a lot of Google people
[00:41:29.360 --> 00:41:31.280]   have had to go back to at least two days a week.
[00:41:31.280 --> 00:41:32.120]   You know, it's not--
[00:41:32.120 --> 00:41:36.560]   - And it's less being in the office in the drive.
[00:41:36.560 --> 00:41:39.000]   Like the drive through Mountain View or Palo Alto
[00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:40.680]   or many of these are just brutal, you know?
[00:41:40.680 --> 00:41:43.800]   And it's, and again, you're stuck in, I mean,
[00:41:43.800 --> 00:41:45.720]   for those living in the South Bay, I'm sorry, I say this,
[00:41:45.720 --> 00:41:47.080]   but it's not a very nice place to live.
[00:41:47.080 --> 00:41:49.040]   Like it's nothing-- - It's a very expensive place
[00:41:49.040 --> 00:41:50.480]   with no culture. - It's super expensive.
[00:41:50.480 --> 00:41:51.600]   - Zero, oh sure. - And it's flat,
[00:41:51.600 --> 00:41:54.280]   and it's not, you know, there's not a lot of,
[00:41:54.280 --> 00:41:56.120]   I mean, unless you have a, you know--
[00:41:56.120 --> 00:41:59.240]   - That's why Johnny, I've lived in San Francisco, right?
[00:41:59.240 --> 00:42:02.200]   - If you've got four or $5 million to spend on a house,
[00:42:02.200 --> 00:42:04.160]   there's a lot of great places in the South Bay
[00:42:04.160 --> 00:42:06.200]   that are, you know, that I've worked in.
[00:42:06.200 --> 00:42:10.360]   So they're, and they, and so, you know, those are great--
[00:42:10.360 --> 00:42:12.120]   - It's very surprising. - It's very surprising.
[00:42:12.120 --> 00:42:13.960]   You have less than, if you have less than
[00:42:13.960 --> 00:42:16.000]   about a million and a half dollars to buy a house
[00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:18.360]   in the South Bay, it's really gonna be rough.
[00:42:18.360 --> 00:42:22.120]   Like it's, and that's a crazy, those numbers are crazy.
[00:42:22.120 --> 00:42:24.480]   - If you don't have to, if you can work from home,
[00:42:24.480 --> 00:42:26.080]   home could be-- - In where?
[00:42:26.080 --> 00:42:27.640]   - Or betos.
[00:42:27.640 --> 00:42:30.520]   - I know people that were working at Google in Hawaii.
[00:42:30.520 --> 00:42:31.360]   - Yeah. - Like they were like,
[00:42:31.360 --> 00:42:33.840]   you know, they finished the, they would, you know,
[00:42:33.840 --> 00:42:36.600]   they'd finish up all the stuff, and then, or they, you know,
[00:42:36.600 --> 00:42:38.720]   or get in the first in the morning, they're out surfing
[00:42:38.720 --> 00:42:40.160]   and then they come in and have meetings, you know?
[00:42:40.160 --> 00:42:41.840]   It's a good thing.
[00:42:41.840 --> 00:42:44.600]   - Somebody wants to fax the radio show in the chair,
[00:42:44.600 --> 00:42:48.240]   and excuse me, there is no fax.
[00:42:48.240 --> 00:42:51.160]   The fax is a lie. - The fax is a lie.
[00:42:51.160 --> 00:42:52.000]   - The fax.
[00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:53.600]   (laughing)
[00:42:53.600 --> 00:42:55.120]   - The ER stuff's office is in Boulder,
[00:42:55.120 --> 00:42:57.200]   and I think a lot of people escaped to that area.
[00:42:57.200 --> 00:42:58.800]   Boulder's beautiful. - I've been in the last two years
[00:42:58.800 --> 00:42:59.640]   as well. - Yeah, my seven- - 20.
[00:42:59.640 --> 00:43:00.480]   - college there.
[00:43:00.480 --> 00:43:03.080]   Boulder is a California in Colorado, you know, it's great.
[00:43:03.080 --> 00:43:05.240]   - It's 27, we used to joke, I used to live in Boulder.
[00:43:05.240 --> 00:43:07.480]   It was 27 square miles surrounded by reality.
[00:43:07.480 --> 00:43:08.320]   - Yeah.
[00:43:08.320 --> 00:43:09.320]   - You know, it's amazing.
[00:43:09.320 --> 00:43:10.600]   - It's an amazing place.
[00:43:10.600 --> 00:43:13.120]   - University of Colorado University of Boulder,
[00:43:13.120 --> 00:43:16.000]   which they called UC Boulder, because half the people
[00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:17.160]   there were from California.
[00:43:17.160 --> 00:43:18.160]   (laughing)
[00:43:18.160 --> 00:43:19.920]   - I should be a second to get that.
[00:43:19.920 --> 00:43:21.480]   - Yeah, University of California, yeah.
[00:43:21.480 --> 00:43:22.640]   - Boulder, yeah. - Yeah.
[00:43:22.640 --> 00:43:23.720]   - Yeah.
[00:43:23.720 --> 00:43:27.720]   - So, Apple has responded to the letter we talked about
[00:43:27.720 --> 00:43:31.000]   last week from the film industry, the open letter to,
[00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:32.760]   we talked about this last week, didn't we?
[00:43:32.760 --> 00:43:34.160]   I hope we did. - Week before, I think.
[00:43:34.160 --> 00:43:35.200]   - Week before.
[00:43:35.200 --> 00:43:38.920]   Apple's response to the Final Cut Pro and TV and film
[00:43:38.920 --> 00:43:43.360]   open letter, the letter to Tim Cook that said Apple should
[00:43:43.360 --> 00:43:47.160]   has to make some changes if they wanna win back
[00:43:47.160 --> 00:43:49.880]   the film and TV industry.
[00:43:49.880 --> 00:43:52.000]   Did you read the letter, Alex?
[00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:53.240]   You're part of this industry.
[00:43:53.240 --> 00:43:54.440]   - Did you find it compelling?
[00:43:54.440 --> 00:43:55.760]   - I talked about it, not really.
[00:43:55.760 --> 00:43:57.920]   I mean, I think that it was, like, sure,
[00:43:57.920 --> 00:44:00.160]   like, yeah, we're gonna have FMCs, FMCs great.
[00:44:00.160 --> 00:44:01.400]   They do a lot of good work and they're gonna have
[00:44:01.400 --> 00:44:02.520]   some more classes and that's fine,
[00:44:02.520 --> 00:44:04.840]   but I still think that it would not be very hard
[00:44:04.840 --> 00:44:06.640]   for Apple to say, we're gonna take one scene
[00:44:06.640 --> 00:44:08.720]   or we're gonna take different pieces out of the content,
[00:44:08.720 --> 00:44:10.440]   all this content that are paying for
[00:44:10.440 --> 00:44:13.320]   and start giving people real, like, real behind the scenes,
[00:44:13.320 --> 00:44:14.200]   like how to deal with it.
[00:44:14.200 --> 00:44:16.320]   It would be the coolest thing that you could,
[00:44:16.320 --> 00:44:18.280]   the coolest way to learn how to do this stuff
[00:44:18.280 --> 00:44:20.840]   is to get more content that is like,
[00:44:20.840 --> 00:44:22.800]   how to build this and really a breakdown
[00:44:22.800 --> 00:44:24.760]   of what that looks like and live streams with those.
[00:44:24.760 --> 00:44:27.720]   And those things would, if Apple got into that program
[00:44:27.720 --> 00:44:29.080]   and spent, you know, I don't know,
[00:44:29.080 --> 00:44:30.360]   a couple million dollars a year on it,
[00:44:30.360 --> 00:44:31.520]   it would make a huge difference.
[00:44:31.520 --> 00:44:33.040]   And they're not, I don't think that Apple
[00:44:33.040 --> 00:44:34.200]   should try to get Hollywood back.
[00:44:34.200 --> 00:44:38.440]   I think they should just arm the peasants with better forks.
[00:44:38.440 --> 00:44:39.760]   - Probably with a hard way to--
[00:44:39.760 --> 00:44:41.920]   - You know, it's a frame of actually.
[00:44:41.920 --> 00:44:43.240]   You know, but I don't think that,
[00:44:43.240 --> 00:44:44.560]   I don't think you should try to get the folks
[00:44:44.560 --> 00:44:46.040]   that are inside the castle to do anything.
[00:44:46.040 --> 00:44:48.080]   I think you just give the people outside the castle
[00:44:48.080 --> 00:44:49.920]   better tools to get inside the castle.
[00:44:49.920 --> 00:44:53.160]   You know, and so just train everybody outside of that,
[00:44:53.160 --> 00:44:55.840]   outside of Hollywood to do it way better in Final Cut.
[00:44:55.840 --> 00:44:58.160]   And you'll solve the problem through attrition.
[00:44:58.160 --> 00:45:02.440]   - They are gonna, as you said,
[00:45:02.440 --> 00:45:05.680]   launch new training products and Apple authorized certs
[00:45:05.680 --> 00:45:09.080]   for Pro Video with their partner future media concepts.
[00:45:09.080 --> 00:45:10.520]   - And I think that's, I mean, that's cute,
[00:45:10.520 --> 00:45:12.480]   but no one cares about those certs.
[00:45:12.480 --> 00:45:13.320]   - Interesting.
[00:45:13.320 --> 00:45:14.640]   - Yeah, I like your idea.
[00:45:14.640 --> 00:45:15.480]   I really do.
[00:45:15.480 --> 00:45:18.880]   And plus it has the benefit of everybody can learn from that.
[00:45:18.880 --> 00:45:20.960]   You don't have, you know, even that kid who's, you know,
[00:45:20.960 --> 00:45:24.280]   self taught, establishing a panel of industry experts,
[00:45:24.280 --> 00:45:28.400]   oh, for regular consultations starting this summer.
[00:45:28.400 --> 00:45:30.320]   - Didn't Apple make a big deal about bringing in
[00:45:30.320 --> 00:45:33.040]   industry experts to design the Mac Pro
[00:45:33.040 --> 00:45:34.280]   when they did the new Mac Pro?
[00:45:34.280 --> 00:45:35.160]   - And there's a team, I mean--
[00:45:35.160 --> 00:45:37.200]   - I mean, yeah, they have a Pro Workflow team
[00:45:37.200 --> 00:45:38.040]   that does that.
[00:45:38.040 --> 00:45:42.600]   So they have people doing that now that are really smart.
[00:45:42.600 --> 00:45:43.800]   Like the people that are working on that
[00:45:43.800 --> 00:45:45.360]   are, then they come from all over the industry,
[00:45:45.360 --> 00:45:47.320]   they're not necessarily Apple people,
[00:45:47.320 --> 00:45:49.600]   they're just people who know how to do great production.
[00:45:49.600 --> 00:45:52.800]   And so they're already working through that.
[00:45:52.800 --> 00:45:56.480]   I think that the main thing that, again,
[00:45:56.480 --> 00:45:58.840]   what gets people excited is working on real projects, you know,
[00:45:58.840 --> 00:46:00.760]   and giving them real projects has them learn.
[00:46:00.760 --> 00:46:02.720]   Like here are all the things that are, you know,
[00:46:02.720 --> 00:46:04.760]   that are there and here's how to put that together.
[00:46:04.760 --> 00:46:05.920]   And here's conversations.
[00:46:05.920 --> 00:46:08.400]   I don't, again, I think that consulting with folks
[00:46:08.400 --> 00:46:09.640]   in the industry, they're just gonna tell them
[00:46:09.640 --> 00:46:11.200]   you make it more like Avid.
[00:46:11.200 --> 00:46:12.480]   You know, that's not the answer.
[00:46:12.480 --> 00:46:14.640]   The answer is, is take the folks that are,
[00:46:14.640 --> 00:46:16.000]   that are doing it in Final Cut,
[00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:18.680]   that are doing really high level stuff and have them
[00:46:18.680 --> 00:46:21.080]   make sure that everybody knows how to work in Final Cut
[00:46:21.080 --> 00:46:23.240]   at a high level, you know, and,
[00:46:23.240 --> 00:46:26.040]   because most people, even myself, included,
[00:46:26.040 --> 00:46:27.600]   I think I barely know how to use Final Cut.
[00:46:27.600 --> 00:46:31.320]   I've been using it since 0.9 of the first one.
[00:46:31.320 --> 00:46:33.640]   And I still feel like, especially with Final Cut 10,
[00:46:33.640 --> 00:46:35.160]   I mean, I get, I do a lot of work in it.
[00:46:35.160 --> 00:46:36.560]   I cut a lot of things.
[00:46:36.560 --> 00:46:39.080]   And then every time I deal with someone who edits every day,
[00:46:39.080 --> 00:46:40.480]   all day, I'm kind of amazed.
[00:46:40.480 --> 00:46:41.520]   I'm like, you can do what?
[00:46:41.520 --> 00:46:42.520]   And you can do this.
[00:46:42.520 --> 00:46:46.520]   And so, I think that it's more about teaching everybody
[00:46:46.520 --> 00:46:48.160]   what those, the tricks of the trade
[00:46:48.160 --> 00:46:51.560]   and how to take full advantage of Final Cut in motion.
[00:46:51.560 --> 00:46:53.640]   Motion is the best deal in the century.
[00:46:53.640 --> 00:46:55.680]   I mean, $50.
[00:46:55.680 --> 00:46:57.400]   I mean, there's so many things that motion does.
[00:46:57.400 --> 00:46:59.640]   Just one thing, like I make countdown clocks in motion.
[00:46:59.640 --> 00:47:01.600]   I make lots of countdown clocks for a lot of streams.
[00:47:01.600 --> 00:47:02.520]   I make them all in motion.
[00:47:02.520 --> 00:47:05.720]   I use 3D, I use all kinds of other things for them.
[00:47:05.720 --> 00:47:07.560]   If you, if motion was a $50 tool,
[00:47:07.560 --> 00:47:09.480]   it just made countdown clocks, I'd pay for it.
[00:47:09.480 --> 00:47:11.280]   But it does, you know.
[00:47:11.280 --> 00:47:13.000]   And, you know, like, and if it,
[00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:15.560]   and then I did, you know, I did a, you know,
[00:47:15.560 --> 00:47:17.080]   I did a hundred and, you know,
[00:47:17.080 --> 00:47:20.000]   I did 120 visual effects shots for a feature film in motion.
[00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:22.000]   Like just green screen and everything else.
[00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:23.760]   And so it's, you know, and we did it.
[00:47:23.760 --> 00:47:26.480]   And that was in 2008, you know,
[00:47:26.480 --> 00:47:28.680]   and we were, you know, looping green screens
[00:47:28.680 --> 00:47:29.960]   in real time back then.
[00:47:29.960 --> 00:47:34.040]   And so it's, you know, these apps are incredibly powerful.
[00:47:34.040 --> 00:47:37.120]   And they're just, the certification thing's cute.
[00:47:37.120 --> 00:47:39.880]   Like, but giving people real content
[00:47:39.880 --> 00:47:42.440]   and having them dig through it and have them interactively talk
[00:47:42.440 --> 00:47:43.720]   to you about it and do workshop,
[00:47:43.720 --> 00:47:45.200]   do workshops where people can learn it.
[00:47:45.200 --> 00:47:46.360]   I don't care about the pieces of paper.
[00:47:46.360 --> 00:47:47.200]   Like when I look at someone,
[00:47:47.200 --> 00:47:48.960]   I don't really care what certifications they have.
[00:47:48.960 --> 00:47:49.800]   And I don't think any, but any,
[00:47:49.800 --> 00:47:51.440]   there's nobody I know that cares
[00:47:51.440 --> 00:47:52.720]   about those certifications look like.
[00:47:52.720 --> 00:47:56.480]   What they need is what people need is real world content
[00:47:56.480 --> 00:47:59.960]   and in a real world expert to tell them how to synthesize
[00:47:59.960 --> 00:48:01.840]   that content into a final product.
[00:48:01.840 --> 00:48:04.200]   - You know, that's really what happens on YouTube, isn't it?
[00:48:04.200 --> 00:48:06.680]   I mean, I mean, right now I sit,
[00:48:06.680 --> 00:48:09.160]   how I learn everything now is I have a computer open
[00:48:09.160 --> 00:48:11.080]   with YouTube on this screen over here.
[00:48:11.080 --> 00:48:13.960]   And I sit there and I work on whether it's cinema 4D
[00:48:13.960 --> 00:48:16.920]   or whatever and I just sit there, search, search, search, search
[00:48:16.920 --> 00:48:19.120]   and you know, and find what I'm looking for.
[00:48:19.120 --> 00:48:22.280]   And I'm basically brute force my way
[00:48:22.280 --> 00:48:24.800]   through learning applications by having YouTube open
[00:48:24.800 --> 00:48:26.920]   and just watching, you know, like watching these little,
[00:48:26.920 --> 00:48:28.080]   and then I, you know, of course,
[00:48:28.080 --> 00:48:29.720]   I'm complaining half the time
[00:48:29.720 --> 00:48:31.760]   because people have a big preamble and they talk about it.
[00:48:31.760 --> 00:48:34.160]   - I know, hit the button and do all of that.
[00:48:34.160 --> 00:48:37.040]   I know, it takes you 10 minutes to get into a YouTube.
[00:48:37.040 --> 00:48:37.880]   - Sorry, YouTubers.
[00:48:37.880 --> 00:48:38.720]   - You just started immediately.
[00:48:38.720 --> 00:48:39.560]   - Yeah.
[00:48:39.560 --> 00:48:40.760]   - I have something about the pro workflows team
[00:48:40.760 --> 00:48:41.880]   'cause I find them fascinating.
[00:48:41.880 --> 00:48:44.120]   Like they are people who you would recognize their names.
[00:48:44.120 --> 00:48:45.720]   Like almost anyone in our industry would recognize
[00:48:45.720 --> 00:48:47.440]   the names of the people who joined that team
[00:48:47.440 --> 00:48:50.200]   and they work inside Apple and part of their purview
[00:48:50.200 --> 00:48:51.880]   is just to hit everything, not just Apple apps,
[00:48:51.880 --> 00:48:54.400]   but anything that runs on any Apple gear,
[00:48:54.400 --> 00:48:57.640]   find problems in the workflow like bottlenecks
[00:48:57.640 --> 00:49:00.520]   or inefficiencies and they'll talk to a ton of people
[00:49:00.520 --> 00:49:02.040]   in the industry, like they'll talk to everybody
[00:49:02.040 --> 00:49:03.320]   who's actually using the tools
[00:49:03.320 --> 00:49:05.160]   and then they'll go and harass Apple internally,
[00:49:05.160 --> 00:49:07.760]   they'll go harass Adobe, they'll go harass Blackmagic
[00:49:07.760 --> 00:49:09.880]   and say this could be twice as fast, three times as fast.
[00:49:09.880 --> 00:49:10.720]   Why are you doing this?
[00:49:10.720 --> 00:49:12.960]   Do this instead and they'll do the same thing with hardware.
[00:49:12.960 --> 00:49:15.560]   They report to John Turnis who's a senior vice president
[00:49:15.560 --> 00:49:17.680]   of hardware and they're like, we need the,
[00:49:17.680 --> 00:49:19.920]   like the reason it looks like you can push a Mac pro
[00:49:19.920 --> 00:49:22.200]   around a back studio lot is 'cause they wanted to push
[00:49:22.200 --> 00:49:24.200]   Mac's pro around a back studio lot.
[00:49:24.200 --> 00:49:27.080]   So it's like a really high end production team
[00:49:27.080 --> 00:49:27.920]   internal to Apple.
[00:49:27.920 --> 00:49:30.800]   - It's like a little seal team six inside of Apple.
[00:49:30.800 --> 00:49:31.640]   - Yeah.
[00:49:31.640 --> 00:49:32.960]   - Like a production seal team six and they're not,
[00:49:32.960 --> 00:49:37.080]   they're not connected to just Mac's either.
[00:49:37.080 --> 00:49:39.320]   They can use anything they want and then they come back
[00:49:39.320 --> 00:49:41.200]   and tell Apple why they use the PC.
[00:49:41.200 --> 00:49:46.000]   - Do not mess with Apple if you're making parts
[00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:51.000]   for the iPhone, a producer, B-O-E,
[00:49:51.000 --> 00:49:54.760]   where are they in China?
[00:49:54.760 --> 00:49:59.200]   - Yeah, they're famous for taking Samsung's OLED process
[00:49:59.200 --> 00:50:00.040]   and replicating it.
[00:50:00.040 --> 00:50:04.400]   - Work contracted for, according to Apple Insider,
[00:50:04.400 --> 00:50:09.400]   30 million iPhone 14 OLED screens until they were alleged
[00:50:09.400 --> 00:50:12.480]   to have changed the circuit width
[00:50:12.480 --> 00:50:15.480]   of the thin film transistors.
[00:50:15.480 --> 00:50:18.960]   Apple Cottum in February halted production
[00:50:18.960 --> 00:50:23.440]   and they're now reportedly at risk of losing all the orders
[00:50:23.440 --> 00:50:27.880]   for 30 million screens for the iPhone.
[00:50:27.880 --> 00:50:31.280]   This resonates with me because after reading
[00:50:31.280 --> 00:50:34.560]   Tripp Mitchell's book, story after story of Johnny I
[00:50:34.560 --> 00:50:39.040]   flying to Foxconn and looking at the aluminum saying,
[00:50:39.040 --> 00:50:41.040]   "Why are there streaks in the aluminum?"
[00:50:41.040 --> 00:50:43.400]   - Oh, I know somebody who has worked at a supplier
[00:50:43.400 --> 00:50:44.920]   and had meetings with Apple and they're like,
[00:50:44.920 --> 00:50:46.160]   Apple's like, "We want this."
[00:50:46.160 --> 00:50:48.000]   And they're like, "We could cut your budget by like,
[00:50:48.000 --> 00:50:50.200]   by in half if we just do this, we don't want that."
[00:50:50.200 --> 00:50:52.280]   But we could save you so, "Are you listening to us?
[00:50:52.280 --> 00:50:53.480]   We told you what we want.
[00:50:53.480 --> 00:50:55.080]   Can you do it or not?"
[00:50:55.080 --> 00:50:56.960]   And that's like, they want exactly what they want
[00:50:56.960 --> 00:50:59.040]   and they will spend more money if a part is like,
[00:50:59.040 --> 00:51:02.000]   a little bit faster, a little bit more environmentally friendly.
[00:51:02.000 --> 00:51:05.120]   They have zero patience and unlimited budget for that stuff.
[00:51:05.120 --> 00:51:07.480]   But BOE has lost their business like three, four years
[00:51:07.480 --> 00:51:11.560]   in a row 'cause like allegedly they took Samsung's OLED process
[00:51:11.560 --> 00:51:13.520]   and replicated it in China and tried to offer it
[00:51:13.520 --> 00:51:16.120]   at a lower price but it's just really expensive stuff.
[00:51:16.120 --> 00:51:17.240]   It's really hard to do right.
[00:51:17.240 --> 00:51:19.800]   It's almost impossible to do right at scale
[00:51:19.800 --> 00:51:22.440]   which is why Samsung can charge so much for those displays
[00:51:22.440 --> 00:51:24.440]   and why everybody else wants more suppliers
[00:51:24.440 --> 00:51:26.400]   of those displays.
[00:51:26.400 --> 00:51:28.000]   But it sounds like another year, another gone.
[00:51:28.000 --> 00:51:28.920]   Where does Apple go?
[00:51:28.920 --> 00:51:31.080]   Did they go to Samsung to get the displays?
[00:51:31.080 --> 00:51:32.040]   Samsung and LG.
[00:51:32.040 --> 00:51:33.080]   LG, yeah.
[00:51:33.080 --> 00:51:36.040]   LG's gotten better, they used to not be as good
[00:51:36.040 --> 00:51:40.200]   but Google and Apple funneled money into LG to get there.
[00:51:40.200 --> 00:51:41.600]   It has to have to be more competitive.
[00:51:41.600 --> 00:51:46.600]   Yeah, this is the source for this is the elect.net.
[00:51:46.600 --> 00:51:47.880]   T-H-E-L-E-C.
[00:51:47.880 --> 00:51:49.640]   Well, I should point out that the elect is a trade,
[00:51:49.640 --> 00:51:52.560]   like is a trade rag in the most Korean of senses
[00:51:52.560 --> 00:51:54.760]   in that they will often, the articles there are often
[00:51:54.760 --> 00:51:56.360]   the companies negotiating publicly.
[00:51:56.360 --> 00:51:57.200]   Oh interesting.
[00:51:57.200 --> 00:51:58.440]   I don't know what they say with a huge grant.
[00:51:58.440 --> 00:51:59.280]   Oh, okay, good.
[00:51:59.280 --> 00:52:01.120]   They'll say Samsung is getting this order,
[00:52:01.120 --> 00:52:02.120]   BOE is getting that.
[00:52:02.120 --> 00:52:05.080]   And a lot of times their meetings are going on
[00:52:05.080 --> 00:52:06.760]   and they're using this as a public way to bargain
[00:52:06.760 --> 00:52:08.680]   or to a two-hour-page business.
[00:52:08.680 --> 00:52:10.880]   Okay, so take it with a grain of salt.
[00:52:10.880 --> 00:52:12.720]   It's a great story though.
[00:52:12.720 --> 00:52:14.080]   Yes, it could be true.
[00:52:14.080 --> 00:52:14.920]   It doesn't mean it's not true.
[00:52:14.920 --> 00:52:15.920]   It just means they want it out there.
[00:52:15.920 --> 00:52:16.760]   Apparently.
[00:52:16.760 --> 00:52:17.600]   Somebody wants it out there.
[00:52:17.600 --> 00:52:22.200]   You know, when they went to China to get the stand
[00:52:22.200 --> 00:52:26.400]   for the iMac that old curved aluminum foot for the iMac,
[00:52:26.400 --> 00:52:28.040]   everybody said, "That can't be done."
[00:52:28.040 --> 00:52:29.600]   And they finally made a machine to do it.
[00:52:29.600 --> 00:52:32.000]   And then Johnny Ive looks at it and says,
[00:52:32.000 --> 00:52:34.240]   "There are streaks in the aluminum."
[00:52:34.240 --> 00:52:37.840]   And they figured out all that's being contaminated by Bora.
[00:52:37.840 --> 00:52:41.200]   No one else saw the streaks, but Johnny Ive saw the streaks
[00:52:41.200 --> 00:52:42.720]   and they were able to figure out a way to do it.
[00:52:42.720 --> 00:52:44.280]   It was that great story.
[00:52:44.280 --> 00:52:45.960]   Like him at the airport sitting with his friend
[00:52:45.960 --> 00:52:47.640]   and he goes, "I just, I can't."
[00:52:47.640 --> 00:52:48.720]   And the friend's like, "What's wrong?"
[00:52:48.720 --> 00:52:51.920]   He's like, "I can't, I can't not see the seams in this bar."
[00:52:51.920 --> 00:52:52.760]   And his friend looks.
[00:52:52.760 --> 00:52:53.600]   Yes.
[00:52:53.600 --> 00:52:54.440]   And it's totally flat.
[00:52:54.440 --> 00:52:55.280]   It's perfect.
[00:52:55.280 --> 00:52:58.920]   And he goes, "It must be freaking terrible to be you."
[00:52:58.920 --> 00:53:01.320]   I don't get the feeling Johnny is a happy person.
[00:53:01.320 --> 00:53:06.120]   He walks through life, disappointed all the time
[00:53:06.120 --> 00:53:07.120]   by African-American--
[00:53:07.120 --> 00:53:07.960]   That designer.
[00:53:07.960 --> 00:53:08.800]   You know, friends like that, right?
[00:53:08.800 --> 00:53:09.720]   Like they'll walk around and go, "Oh, Mistral,
[00:53:09.720 --> 00:53:11.000]   why is that typeface Mistral?
[00:53:11.000 --> 00:53:12.040]   Why is that store sign?"
[00:53:12.040 --> 00:53:13.760]   And you're like, "It's a store sign.
[00:53:13.760 --> 00:53:14.960]   Why is it destroying your life?"
[00:53:14.960 --> 00:53:15.800]   It is.
[00:53:15.800 --> 00:53:17.400]   Do not be a designer.
[00:53:17.400 --> 00:53:18.880]   Do not be a designer.
[00:53:18.880 --> 00:53:19.720]   You get used to it.
[00:53:19.720 --> 00:53:21.600]   I mean, I have to admit that I'm--
[00:53:21.600 --> 00:53:23.000]   You're a specular highlight.
[00:53:23.000 --> 00:53:23.680]   I know.
[00:53:23.680 --> 00:53:24.520]   I know.
[00:53:24.520 --> 00:53:26.280]   I'm a constant state of upset.
[00:53:26.280 --> 00:53:28.720]   And you just have to become one with the upset.
[00:53:28.720 --> 00:53:29.720]   It's not like it's--
[00:53:29.720 --> 00:53:31.520]   You're still up for Alex?
[00:53:31.520 --> 00:53:34.360]   Well, life isn't perfect, Alex.
[00:53:34.360 --> 00:53:35.600]   No, but it's--
[00:53:35.600 --> 00:53:37.360]   But if you're working in Apple, Apple's
[00:53:37.360 --> 00:53:39.680]   the place that lets your OCD run free.
[00:53:39.680 --> 00:53:40.680]   Yeah.
[00:53:40.680 --> 00:53:42.040]   You know, like you just--
[00:53:42.040 --> 00:53:48.920]   But I think that there's just certain personalities.
[00:53:48.920 --> 00:53:50.280]   I fit into that.
[00:53:50.280 --> 00:53:52.400]   I'm just upset about everything all the time.
[00:53:52.400 --> 00:53:53.920]   Like it's to some level.
[00:53:53.920 --> 00:53:55.200]   You know, like I'm just like, this stinks,
[00:53:55.200 --> 00:53:56.960]   and this should be longer, and this should be this way.
[00:53:56.960 --> 00:53:58.120]   And this is--
[00:53:58.120 --> 00:54:00.280]   I don't ever want to watch TV with you.
[00:54:00.280 --> 00:54:00.800]   Well, thanks.
[00:54:00.800 --> 00:54:03.440]   I know about listening to music, or people who see drop names,
[00:54:03.440 --> 00:54:05.040]   watching, looking at graphics.
[00:54:05.040 --> 00:54:06.560]   No, I'm just-- you know, I get--
[00:54:06.560 --> 00:54:08.320]   I get any resolution to the plot line,
[00:54:08.320 --> 00:54:09.000]   to the script.
[00:54:09.000 --> 00:54:12.120]   I try not to get contaminated by Alex's point of view.
[00:54:12.120 --> 00:54:13.440]   I just try to--
[00:54:13.440 --> 00:54:16.520]   I try to-- I've learned to hold it to myself most time,
[00:54:16.520 --> 00:54:18.200]   because it ruins life for everybody else.
[00:54:18.200 --> 00:54:20.120]   Like, in my cauldron, it's OK.
[00:54:20.120 --> 00:54:21.960]   You know, like, I know what to do with it,
[00:54:21.960 --> 00:54:23.480]   and where to put it, how to put it in a box.
[00:54:23.480 --> 00:54:25.600]   But if I started telling everybody what goes
[00:54:25.600 --> 00:54:28.280]   from my head about every piece of object around me,
[00:54:28.280 --> 00:54:29.960]   I'm upset.
[00:54:29.960 --> 00:54:33.960]   Time out for a mention from one of our fine sponsors.
[00:54:33.960 --> 00:54:38.480]   We shall continue with the never satisfied Alex Lindsay
[00:54:38.480 --> 00:54:39.600]   office hours.
[00:54:39.600 --> 00:54:42.080]   That's a good look, Alex.
[00:54:42.080 --> 00:54:44.120]   I like it.
[00:54:44.120 --> 00:54:47.480]   Oh, 9090.media, if you want this perfectionist,
[00:54:47.480 --> 00:54:51.240]   making your stream the best it's ever been.
[00:54:51.240 --> 00:54:54.880]   And the Inako from WGBH Boston.
[00:54:54.880 --> 00:54:56.920]   It's always a pleasure having Andy,
[00:54:56.920 --> 00:55:00.400]   who has a little bit more of a sanguine approach to life.
[00:55:00.400 --> 00:55:03.760]   Sometimes I think a diner's burger might disassitify,
[00:55:03.760 --> 00:55:07.560]   but you don't storm out in a huff.
[00:55:07.560 --> 00:55:08.840]   Oh, he's muted.
[00:55:08.840 --> 00:55:11.440]   I have no-- no, I have no--
[00:55:11.440 --> 00:55:12.600]   We muted you.
[00:55:12.600 --> 00:55:13.360]   I apologize.
[00:55:13.360 --> 00:55:14.000]   That was our fault.
[00:55:14.000 --> 00:55:14.800]   That's OK.
[00:55:14.800 --> 00:55:16.960]   That's usually a smart thing.
[00:55:16.960 --> 00:55:19.760]   But no, Andy, I just want you to know.
[00:55:19.760 --> 00:55:20.960]   I don't control it.
[00:55:20.960 --> 00:55:21.960]   I have no--
[00:55:21.960 --> 00:55:23.840]   I don't know again.
[00:55:23.840 --> 00:55:27.360]   I bow down before our rest and rule producers.
[00:55:27.360 --> 00:55:29.360]   They absolutely know what they're doing.
[00:55:29.360 --> 00:55:30.320]   But no, I don't--
[00:55:30.320 --> 00:55:32.560]   I've never left a diner in a huff.
[00:55:32.560 --> 00:55:34.400]   I haven't had a car for like five or six years.
[00:55:34.400 --> 00:55:37.680]   So it's hard to huff when you're walking.
[00:55:37.680 --> 00:55:40.480]   Well, I don't know if that's the hot new e-car or something
[00:55:40.480 --> 00:55:40.960]   like that.
[00:55:40.960 --> 00:55:41.480]   The huff.
[00:55:41.480 --> 00:55:42.480]   I need a huff.
[00:55:42.480 --> 00:55:43.600]   There's a good one about it.
[00:55:43.600 --> 00:55:46.760]   Wasn't there-- wasn't there an old car a huff?
[00:55:46.760 --> 00:55:49.680]   Sounds familiar, actually.
[00:55:49.680 --> 00:55:52.440]   Mobile-- the huff mobile.
[00:55:52.440 --> 00:55:57.480]   Also with us, ReneeRitchieYouTube.com/ReneeRitchie.
[00:55:57.480 --> 00:56:00.720]   If I seem a little jollyer today than usual,
[00:56:00.720 --> 00:56:03.200]   it's because I had such a good night's sleep last night.
[00:56:03.200 --> 00:56:09.040]   On my beautiful eight sleep pod pro cover.
[00:56:09.040 --> 00:56:12.280]   Sleep is nature's gentle nurse.
[00:56:12.280 --> 00:56:15.240]   The ultimate game changer consistent good sleep
[00:56:15.240 --> 00:56:18.280]   can reduce the likelihood of serious health issues,
[00:56:18.280 --> 00:56:21.800]   decrease the risk of heart disease, lower blood pressure,
[00:56:21.800 --> 00:56:25.000]   even reduce the risk of Alzheimer's.
[00:56:25.000 --> 00:56:31.280]   And yet, sad to say more than 30% of Americans struggle
[00:56:31.280 --> 00:56:34.680]   with sleep and temperature is one of the main causes.
[00:56:34.680 --> 00:56:40.080]   Yes, temperature of poor sleep.
[00:56:40.080 --> 00:56:43.720]   I do not have to fear the heat or the cold
[00:56:43.720 --> 00:56:47.720]   because I have the eight sleep pod pro cover.
[00:56:47.720 --> 00:56:48.720]   What is it?
[00:56:48.720 --> 00:56:50.320]   Well, I'm glad you asked.
[00:56:50.320 --> 00:56:51.320]   You put it over your bed.
[00:56:51.320 --> 00:56:52.720]   They actually make mattresses as well.
[00:56:52.720 --> 00:56:53.720]   We have a mattress we like.
[00:56:53.720 --> 00:56:56.240]   So we just got the cover, put it over the mattress.
[00:56:56.240 --> 00:57:01.760]   It does dynamic cooling and heating with biometric tracking.
[00:57:01.760 --> 00:57:04.840]   It can go as cool as 55 degrees Fahrenheit,
[00:57:04.840 --> 00:57:08.360]   as hot as 110 degrees Fahrenheit or anywhere in between.
[00:57:08.360 --> 00:57:11.720]   You said it initially the way you feel like you like it.
[00:57:11.720 --> 00:57:14.320]   And I think for most people, the idea is--
[00:57:14.320 --> 00:57:15.840]   certainly it works for me--
[00:57:15.840 --> 00:57:19.200]   start a little cozy in the evening, a plus two or three
[00:57:19.200 --> 00:57:20.520]   on the dial.
[00:57:20.520 --> 00:57:23.160]   And then as I fall into deeper and deeper sleep,
[00:57:23.160 --> 00:57:26.840]   the eight sleep actually supports that by cooling off.
[00:57:26.840 --> 00:57:31.280]   Turns out that is what your body expects to cool off at night.
[00:57:31.280 --> 00:57:34.480]   And then I have it set to wake me up in the morning.
[00:57:34.480 --> 00:57:38.480]   Instead of an alarm, I have the eight sleep start to warm up.
[00:57:38.480 --> 00:57:43.400]   And I wake up feeling cozy, comfortable, and well rested.
[00:57:43.400 --> 00:57:46.120]   But after you set your initial settings,
[00:57:46.120 --> 00:57:49.160]   the eight sleep biometric tracking will monitor your sleep
[00:57:49.160 --> 00:57:53.360]   and do what it can to improve it by modifying the temperature.
[00:57:53.360 --> 00:57:55.560]   Now, Lisa has completely different sleep patterns,
[00:57:55.560 --> 00:57:57.640]   but the cover will adjust each side of the bed
[00:57:57.640 --> 00:58:00.440]   based on your particular biometrics.
[00:58:00.440 --> 00:58:03.120]   It also looks at the bedroom temperature.
[00:58:03.120 --> 00:58:05.560]   If it's really hot in there, it'll cool you off.
[00:58:05.560 --> 00:58:08.600]   In fact, you don't have to fear hot summer nights
[00:58:08.600 --> 00:58:11.640]   or chilly winter nights ever again with eight sleep.
[00:58:11.640 --> 00:58:14.960]   Eight sleep users fall asleep up to 32% faster,
[00:58:14.960 --> 00:58:16.960]   reduce sleep interruptions by 40%
[00:58:16.960 --> 00:58:20.000]   and get overall a more restful sleep.
[00:58:20.000 --> 00:58:24.800]   30% more deep sleep means you're just feeling great for the day.
[00:58:24.800 --> 00:58:28.360]   Your physical recovery, your hormone regulation,
[00:58:28.360 --> 00:58:30.560]   your mental clarity, incredible.
[00:58:30.560 --> 00:58:35.960]   Show up as your best self with eight sleep.
[00:58:35.960 --> 00:58:38.880]   I just, I know I can never sleep without it now.
[00:58:38.880 --> 00:58:41.960]   That's just, it's like it's a requirement.
[00:58:41.960 --> 00:58:42.800]   I love it.
[00:58:42.800 --> 00:58:46.400]   I'm a little worried about travel without,
[00:58:46.400 --> 00:58:48.200]   what am I gonna do without my eight sleep?
[00:58:48.200 --> 00:58:50.840]   Maybe they need to make them affordable eight sleep.
[00:58:50.840 --> 00:58:55.160]   Go to eightsleep.com/macbreak, E-I-G-H-T-S-L-E-E-P.
[00:58:55.160 --> 00:58:57.280]   This is a really good time because they've got
[00:58:57.280 --> 00:59:00.840]   exclusive Memorial Day savings through June 6th.
[00:59:00.840 --> 00:59:02.800]   So do not wait.
[00:59:02.800 --> 00:59:07.240]   Head on over to eightsleep.com/macbreak.
[00:59:07.240 --> 00:59:09.440]   Cool down this summer with eight sleep,
[00:59:09.440 --> 00:59:12.480]   shipping in the US, Canada and the UK.
[00:59:12.480 --> 00:59:15.040]   And if you're hearing this later, after June 6th,
[00:59:15.040 --> 00:59:18.440]   just use eightsleep.com/macbreak
[00:59:18.440 --> 00:59:19.920]   and check out the PodPro cover.
[00:59:19.920 --> 00:59:22.640]   You'll save $150 to check out.
[00:59:22.640 --> 00:59:24.560]   It was Kevin Rose told me about the eight sleep
[00:59:24.560 --> 00:59:28.400]   and the name E-Web got it and she said, "She, Kevin's right."
[00:59:28.400 --> 00:59:29.480]   And then I got it.
[00:59:29.480 --> 00:59:31.080]   We had it for about six months.
[00:59:31.080 --> 00:59:32.000]   Couldn't live without it.
[00:59:32.000 --> 00:59:35.040]   eightsleep.com/macbreak.
[00:59:35.040 --> 00:59:39.240]   Thank you so much for supporting Mac Break Weekly.
[00:59:39.240 --> 00:59:42.000]   (sighs)
[00:59:42.000 --> 00:59:43.960]   (sings)
[00:59:43.960 --> 00:59:47.920]   Top 100 most influential people of 2022.
[00:59:47.920 --> 00:59:48.880]   Who else?
[00:59:48.880 --> 00:59:52.680]   Survey says, Survey says, "Tim Cook."
[00:59:52.680 --> 00:59:54.200]   Does, they didn't give a number.
[00:59:54.200 --> 00:59:56.080]   He's just in the list.
[00:59:56.080 --> 00:59:57.360]   But I like it.
[00:59:57.360 --> 00:59:59.640]   What I really like is that the little,
[00:59:59.640 --> 01:00:01.200]   you know, they always get somebody who knows you
[01:00:01.200 --> 01:00:02.880]   to write a little piece about it.
[01:00:02.880 --> 01:00:06.400]   The little piece about Tim Cook is written by Lorraine Pal jobs.
[01:00:06.400 --> 01:00:09.700]   Steve Jobs' widow, which is really cool.
[01:00:09.700 --> 01:00:14.000]   He's on the cover of the time 100.
[01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:15.480]   So I guess he's number one.
[01:00:15.480 --> 01:00:17.680]   There's four covers though.
[01:00:17.680 --> 01:00:19.280]   So they don't want to keep us guessing.
[01:00:19.280 --> 01:00:20.360]   Oh, rats.
[01:00:20.360 --> 01:00:22.640]   (laughs)
[01:00:22.640 --> 01:00:25.600]   And you know, these lists are, you know,
[01:00:25.600 --> 01:00:26.960]   they're, they are what they are.
[01:00:26.960 --> 01:00:28.040]   But I think it's nice.
[01:00:28.040 --> 01:00:30.080]   I really think it's great that he does,
[01:00:30.080 --> 01:00:32.800]   after reading this book, he deserves it absolutely.
[01:00:32.800 --> 01:00:36.040]   But also, I love it that Lorraine Pal jobs.
[01:00:36.040 --> 01:00:37.320]   The blurb is really a steal too.
[01:00:37.320 --> 01:00:39.000]   Like she did a great job characterizing
[01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:42.440]   what makes him exceptional in this particular time and age.
[01:00:42.440 --> 01:00:45.520]   Apple is Tim Cook's life work and in this work,
[01:00:45.520 --> 01:00:48.000]   Tim displays mastery.
[01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:50.600]   She writes, "He's demonstrated more range
[01:00:50.600 --> 01:00:52.880]   "in his leadership of one of the world's largest companies
[01:00:52.880 --> 01:00:56.120]   "than any contemporary CEO, business wisdom,
[01:00:56.120 --> 01:00:58.000]   "philosophical wisdom.
[01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:01.200]   "She talks about the pressure of setting
[01:01:01.200 --> 01:01:04.600]   "and executing Apple's progression with deep precision,
[01:01:04.600 --> 01:01:07.480]   "taking responsibility for the company's effects on society,
[01:01:07.480 --> 01:01:11.640]   "something her husband notably did not do.
[01:01:11.640 --> 01:01:16.640]   "Although she has done absolutely since his passing,
[01:01:16.640 --> 01:01:20.360]   "she's been very active in good works.
[01:01:20.360 --> 01:01:22.040]   "Tim does it with compassion and discipline.
[01:01:22.040 --> 01:01:24.840]   "She writes, turning to nature to replenish his spirit
[01:01:24.840 --> 01:01:26.200]   "in the summer he could be found,
[01:01:26.200 --> 01:01:28.000]   "hiking in our national parks,
[01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:31.280]   "boyed by the majesty of the mountains."
[01:01:31.280 --> 01:01:32.120]   Wow.
[01:01:32.120 --> 01:01:33.240]   - It's deep didn't believe in pimping karma.
[01:01:33.240 --> 01:01:34.560]   He thought if you did it and told people
[01:01:34.560 --> 01:01:36.560]   then you were doing it for bad reason.
[01:01:36.560 --> 01:01:37.400]   - Right.
[01:01:37.400 --> 01:01:38.240]   - That you got to keep all that to yourself
[01:01:38.240 --> 01:01:40.760]   and Tim believes that you can lead by example.
[01:01:40.760 --> 01:01:44.200]   - Well, I think the employees appreciate it
[01:01:44.200 --> 01:01:45.760]   as well as one of the very first things he did
[01:01:45.760 --> 01:01:48.320]   when he took over as CEO is to do matching
[01:01:48.320 --> 01:01:50.160]   and encourage employees to give.
[01:01:50.160 --> 01:01:52.520]   And so that really makes a big difference.
[01:01:52.520 --> 01:01:53.800]   Tim strives valiantly.
[01:01:53.800 --> 01:01:57.280]   She writes, "Dares greatly and spends himself
[01:01:57.280 --> 01:01:59.600]   "in a grand cause."
[01:01:59.600 --> 01:02:02.960]   In fact, that is another thing I got from the Tripp-Mickill book
[01:02:02.960 --> 01:02:04.800]   is that Tim is an absolute workaholic.
[01:02:04.800 --> 01:02:08.440]   Nobody can keep up with, gets up at four in the morning.
[01:02:08.440 --> 01:02:13.040]   He has apparently very few outside interests,
[01:02:13.040 --> 01:02:15.360]   lives on steamed vegetables and fish.
[01:02:15.360 --> 01:02:17.640]   - And Mountain Dew.
[01:02:17.640 --> 01:02:18.480]   - And Mountain Dew.
[01:02:18.480 --> 01:02:19.320]   - That's quite a combo, Steve.
[01:02:19.320 --> 01:02:20.160]   - Oh, well.
[01:02:20.160 --> 01:02:22.160]   - Team vegetables, chicken and Mountain Dew.
[01:02:22.160 --> 01:02:23.000]   - Mountain Dew.
[01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:24.440]   And never a diner.
[01:02:24.440 --> 01:02:27.200]   - Little bit of California, little bit of California.
[01:02:27.200 --> 01:02:28.040]   - Little bit.
[01:02:28.040 --> 01:02:28.880]   - Yeah.
[01:02:28.880 --> 01:02:29.720]   - Yep.
[01:02:29.720 --> 01:02:30.560]   - Definitely.
[01:02:30.560 --> 01:02:32.160]   War Eagle all the way.
[01:02:32.160 --> 01:02:34.240]   So that's cool.
[01:02:34.240 --> 01:02:35.080]   Good job.
[01:02:35.080 --> 01:02:37.640]   And well deserved, I think.
[01:02:37.640 --> 01:02:38.520]   We knew this would happen.
[01:02:38.520 --> 01:02:40.200]   It happens every year, right about this time.
[01:02:40.200 --> 01:02:44.680]   The Pride Watch Edition Watch Bands are out.
[01:02:44.680 --> 01:02:49.000]   And along with it, a new shot on iPhone Pride campaign,
[01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:51.240]   which will launch in June.
[01:02:51.240 --> 01:02:54.440]   The bands always come with a face as well.
[01:02:54.440 --> 01:02:56.120]   - Yep.
[01:02:57.120 --> 01:02:59.280]   - Pride Edition Sport Loop,
[01:02:59.280 --> 01:03:00.760]   a color gradient that incorporates
[01:03:00.760 --> 01:03:02.280]   the original rainbow colors
[01:03:02.280 --> 01:03:05.000]   with those drawn from various Pride flags,
[01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:07.000]   including light blue, pink, white.
[01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:08.360]   That's kind of cool.
[01:03:08.360 --> 01:03:10.200]   The, there's the, let's see.
[01:03:10.200 --> 01:03:12.720]   Here's, I think that's the, is that the--
[01:03:12.720 --> 01:03:13.880]   - It's regular and it's mickey.
[01:03:13.880 --> 01:03:15.520]   - That's the threads.
[01:03:15.520 --> 01:03:17.840]   Yeah, so it's more pastel than in previous years.
[01:03:17.840 --> 01:03:20.520]   It was kind of a pure rainbow in previous years.
[01:03:20.520 --> 01:03:21.880]   It's very pretty.
[01:03:21.880 --> 01:03:22.720]   - Yeah.
[01:03:22.720 --> 01:03:24.280]   This is, that's a good example of the stuff
[01:03:24.280 --> 01:03:25.880]   that we were just talking about.
[01:03:25.880 --> 01:03:29.040]   - That I, it's, I have,
[01:03:29.040 --> 01:03:31.040]   it's become like sort of a tradition.
[01:03:31.040 --> 01:03:33.120]   Even when I stopped wearing an Apple Watch,
[01:03:33.120 --> 01:03:35.760]   that I switched the band to my, of my fitness band
[01:03:35.760 --> 01:03:37.520]   to a Pride style band,
[01:03:37.520 --> 01:03:40.320]   because I just like the idea of basically flying
[01:03:40.320 --> 01:03:42.320]   those colors in support.
[01:03:42.320 --> 01:03:46.520]   And it did like, I think they're the first to,
[01:03:46.520 --> 01:03:49.080]   the first one to really, really support that kind of idea,
[01:03:49.080 --> 01:03:50.400]   like for fitness watches.
[01:03:50.400 --> 01:03:51.840]   And now you can't buy a fitness watch.
[01:03:51.840 --> 01:03:53.640]   It does not have some sort of a rainbow,
[01:03:53.640 --> 01:03:55.840]   or a Pride band available for it.
[01:03:55.840 --> 01:03:58.760]   And this is how, how subtly,
[01:03:58.760 --> 01:04:03.240]   subtlely Apple interweaves its values
[01:04:03.240 --> 01:04:07.360]   and its morals into how they operate with daily business.
[01:04:07.360 --> 01:04:09.520]   - This is the Nike band, which has,
[01:04:09.520 --> 01:04:13.520]   is less pastel has a black thread woven in,
[01:04:13.520 --> 01:04:16.160]   which is apparently part of Nike's campaign.
[01:04:16.160 --> 01:04:17.000]   - Yeah.
[01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:19.560]   - Very, they're both beautiful, very pretty.
[01:04:19.560 --> 01:04:24.400]   Here's the shot on iPhone Pride campaign
[01:04:24.400 --> 01:04:26.400]   from Harvey Milk Plaza in San Francisco
[01:04:26.400 --> 01:04:29.000]   to Polista Avenue in San Paolo.
[01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:33.320]   The shot on Pride campaign showcases places of historic
[01:04:33.320 --> 01:04:38.040]   in significance to the LGBTQ+ movement.
[01:04:38.040 --> 01:04:38.880]   That's cool.
[01:04:38.880 --> 01:04:43.880]   So those new ads when campaigns will be out
[01:04:43.880 --> 01:04:46.200]   in June for Pride month.
[01:04:46.200 --> 01:04:48.320]   - It's our contrast to how Netflix is in the news
[01:04:48.320 --> 01:04:50.240]   about the very similar issues today.
[01:04:50.240 --> 01:04:51.320]   - Oh, yeah.
[01:04:51.320 --> 01:04:52.480]   There you go, Ricky, you're very--
[01:04:52.480 --> 01:04:53.400]   - Ricky Jervais.
[01:04:53.400 --> 01:04:54.600]   - Good old Ricky.
[01:04:54.600 --> 01:04:56.680]   - Well, but you know, I think part of Ricky's act
[01:04:56.680 --> 01:04:59.120]   is to be hated by somebody.
[01:04:59.120 --> 01:05:01.920]   - No, well, part of his act is to be absolutely smug
[01:05:01.920 --> 01:05:02.920]   and insufferable.
[01:05:02.920 --> 01:05:04.640]   - That's another way to put it.
[01:05:04.640 --> 01:05:05.480]   - Yeah.
[01:05:05.480 --> 01:05:09.520]   - What annoys me is that he heads off any possible
[01:05:09.520 --> 01:05:11.760]   criticisms by saying, no, no, but anybody who
[01:05:11.760 --> 01:05:14.920]   who says they're offended by any joke is just an idiot.
[01:05:14.920 --> 01:05:17.280]   So if you hear anybody like criticize me
[01:05:17.280 --> 01:05:19.160]   for whatever I say in a stand up act,
[01:05:19.160 --> 01:05:20.720]   it's not because it wasn't funny.
[01:05:20.720 --> 01:05:22.200]   It's not because this is the wrong time
[01:05:22.200 --> 01:05:23.360]   to make a joke like that.
[01:05:23.360 --> 01:05:25.560]   It's not because it promotes people,
[01:05:25.560 --> 01:05:27.920]   you're basically promoting an ethos
[01:05:27.920 --> 01:05:32.760]   that lawmakers are now using to persecute LGBTQ+ people.
[01:05:32.760 --> 01:05:34.400]   No, it's because you're small-minded
[01:05:34.400 --> 01:05:36.520]   and not as clever as I am.
[01:05:36.520 --> 01:05:39.160]   But that's why we have always the comics defenses in it.
[01:05:39.160 --> 01:05:40.360]   - It's just a joke, man.
[01:05:40.360 --> 01:05:41.560]   - Only the only the hacks.
[01:05:41.560 --> 01:05:42.400]   - Until they get hit.
[01:05:42.400 --> 01:05:43.680]   - Only the hacks.
[01:05:43.680 --> 01:05:45.800]   - Prehistoric Planet, I missed it last night.
[01:05:45.800 --> 01:05:47.520]   Was it good?
[01:05:47.520 --> 01:05:48.360]   - I missed it too.
[01:05:48.360 --> 01:05:49.200]   - It's so much fun.
[01:05:49.200 --> 01:05:50.120]   - Ah, it's so much fun.
[01:05:50.120 --> 01:05:51.840]   - So it's all this week, there's five episodes.
[01:05:51.840 --> 01:05:54.520]   So Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday.
[01:05:54.520 --> 01:05:56.600]   - I presume I can go back and watch last night's.
[01:05:56.600 --> 01:05:57.440]   I mean, right?
[01:05:57.440 --> 01:05:58.280]   - Yeah, okay.
[01:05:58.280 --> 01:05:59.120]   - No, it's all out one night.
[01:05:59.120 --> 01:05:59.960]   - It was indeed a mess.
[01:05:59.960 --> 01:06:02.120]   - Swimming was like all over the social.
[01:06:02.120 --> 01:06:04.240]   - It was so beautifully done.
[01:06:04.240 --> 01:06:07.640]   I've, this isn't the first documentary style thing
[01:06:07.640 --> 01:06:10.680]   where we're gonna be including CGI in such a way
[01:06:10.680 --> 01:06:13.680]   that it'll feel as though it's been filmed.
[01:06:13.680 --> 01:06:15.760]   And yeah, it's really great graphics
[01:06:15.760 --> 01:06:17.080]   and really helps to sell the point
[01:06:17.080 --> 01:06:19.480]   they're trying to make about these creatures.
[01:06:19.480 --> 01:06:22.920]   But this is the first one where my brain bought it
[01:06:22.920 --> 01:06:24.680]   like immediately.
[01:06:24.680 --> 01:06:26.280]   It's like, no, they,
[01:06:26.280 --> 01:06:28.440]   maybe part of it was having gotten burrows voice over it.
[01:06:28.440 --> 01:06:29.280]   - Oh, God, yes.
[01:06:29.280 --> 01:06:31.000]   - The user interface of the master.
[01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:34.120]   But still, it was used not as a stunt,
[01:06:34.120 --> 01:06:36.000]   not as a hey look how clever we are with seat,
[01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:37.920]   with digital graphics.
[01:06:37.920 --> 01:06:40.480]   But like, no, here is a way that we can tell these stories
[01:06:40.480 --> 01:06:42.400]   and ways that we haven't been able to do before
[01:06:42.400 --> 01:06:43.760]   and so perfectly done.
[01:06:43.760 --> 01:06:47.960]   What a jewel in Apple TV's content, Chrono.
[01:06:47.960 --> 01:06:50.600]   First episode, "Coasts."
[01:06:50.600 --> 01:06:54.520]   I would do my, my aton burrow, but I probably shouldn't.
[01:06:54.520 --> 01:06:55.800]   (laughing)
[01:06:55.800 --> 01:06:57.120]   But he sure begs it, doesn't it?
[01:06:57.120 --> 01:07:00.320]   A pregnant tyrannosaurus is in distress
[01:07:00.320 --> 01:07:02.840]   and her young calf can sense it
[01:07:02.840 --> 01:07:04.960]   as she travels waters that are home
[01:07:04.960 --> 01:07:07.320]   to the oceans, deadly as predators.
[01:07:07.320 --> 01:07:09.240]   - You know, I just think that there's such a huge opportunity
[01:07:09.240 --> 01:07:11.600]   to visualize so many things.
[01:07:11.600 --> 01:07:14.160]   You know, and I will say that my favorite,
[01:07:14.160 --> 01:07:17.200]   my favorite things in Apple TV are the nonfiction.
[01:07:17.200 --> 01:07:20.080]   Like, so I know that there's a lot of great series.
[01:07:20.080 --> 01:07:22.960]   I haven't been able to get really into any of them,
[01:07:22.960 --> 01:07:27.960]   but the Mark Ronson, you know, one on music,
[01:07:27.960 --> 01:07:30.000]   the tiny world of this,
[01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:31.680]   these are the things that have me keep coming back.
[01:07:31.680 --> 01:07:33.880]   And what's great about that is Apple is picking up
[01:07:33.880 --> 01:07:35.640]   these verticals while they're looking for these big,
[01:07:35.640 --> 01:07:37.800]   you know, kind of narrative things
[01:07:37.800 --> 01:07:40.640]   that they are digging in and doing, just throwing,
[01:07:40.640 --> 01:07:42.880]   you know, just take things that people have done
[01:07:42.880 --> 01:07:44.560]   and then throw all the money into it.
[01:07:44.560 --> 01:07:46.800]   You know, I just make it amazing.
[01:07:46.800 --> 01:07:48.720]   And so the thing that keeps me hooked to Apple,
[01:07:48.720 --> 01:07:50.720]   I probably drop Apple TV if it wasn't
[01:07:50.720 --> 01:07:52.680]   for the non-fictional stuff.
[01:07:52.680 --> 01:07:53.760]   You know, I don't find any of the other
[01:07:53.760 --> 01:07:56.560]   - Well, I'm smart because they dol it out just enough
[01:07:56.560 --> 01:07:58.640]   to keep you subscribed.
[01:07:58.640 --> 01:08:00.520]   No fools, they.
[01:08:00.520 --> 01:08:02.880]   Tonight will be deserts.
[01:08:02.880 --> 01:08:05.920]   I mean, I'm not gonna miss dreadnoughts
[01:08:05.920 --> 01:08:08.160]   fighting amongst each other.
[01:08:08.160 --> 01:08:10.280]   So the idea, if you don't know yet,
[01:08:10.280 --> 01:08:13.360]   is it's a nature series,
[01:08:13.360 --> 01:08:17.480]   but it's featuring prehistoric creatures, dinosaurs.
[01:08:17.480 --> 01:08:20.800]   And it's done in such an amazing way that you think it's real.
[01:08:20.800 --> 01:08:23.000]   Yeah, I would say it's the best stuff.
[01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:24.720]   The best stuff is in the trailer.
[01:08:24.720 --> 01:08:27.480]   The, from a visual effects perspective,
[01:08:27.480 --> 01:08:29.800]   I will say that it is,
[01:08:29.800 --> 01:08:30.640]   yeah, tell us.
[01:08:30.640 --> 01:08:31.480]   It's exceptional.
[01:08:31.480 --> 01:08:35.360]   It's exceptional CG, not in my eyes, not photo real.
[01:08:35.360 --> 01:08:37.160]   So, you know, there's parts of it.
[01:08:37.160 --> 01:08:38.480]   There's hints of it that I think get just right.
[01:08:38.480 --> 01:08:40.720]   This is the perfectionist Alex Lindsey coming up.
[01:08:40.720 --> 01:08:42.960]   So I think that it is a,
[01:08:42.960 --> 01:08:45.000]   he made the mirror spaceship.
[01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:48.200]   Yeah, so it's an exceptional, exceptional CG.
[01:08:48.200 --> 01:08:50.200]   But you can kind of tell in CG.
[01:08:50.200 --> 01:08:51.680]   But you can, you know, it just has that.
[01:08:51.680 --> 01:08:54.360]   It's the next, the next,
[01:08:54.360 --> 01:08:56.000]   look at this image to make it look.
[01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:57.360]   You can kind of tell, right?
[01:08:57.360 --> 01:08:59.560]   The next two or three percent to make that photo real
[01:08:59.560 --> 01:09:02.320]   is a delta of like a hundred million dollars.
[01:09:02.320 --> 01:09:04.040]   Yeah, like, you know, like it's, you know, like it's,
[01:09:04.040 --> 01:09:06.040]   or wait five years.
[01:09:06.040 --> 01:09:06.880]   Don't.
[01:09:06.880 --> 01:09:07.640]   (laughs)
[01:09:07.640 --> 01:09:08.480]   Don't tell that word.
[01:09:08.480 --> 01:09:10.360]   But it's like, no, no, it's like,
[01:09:10.360 --> 01:09:11.600]   it's just not real.
[01:09:11.600 --> 01:09:13.240]   Like you can't make, I'm never going to accept
[01:09:13.240 --> 01:09:14.480]   a giant green person.
[01:09:14.480 --> 01:09:15.880]   It's just never going to register for rain.
[01:09:15.880 --> 01:09:17.800]   But what I would say is,
[01:09:17.800 --> 01:09:19.760]   there are shots of the T-Rex that I think,
[01:09:19.760 --> 01:09:20.800]   that get there.
[01:09:20.800 --> 01:09:22.680]   You know, it's definitely like,
[01:09:22.680 --> 01:09:24.800]   there's some shots that I felt went over
[01:09:24.800 --> 01:09:26.960]   and just was like, wow, that's, I'm just looking at it.
[01:09:26.960 --> 01:09:29.640]   And then, and a lot of it has to do with, you know,
[01:09:29.640 --> 01:09:31.560]   fine detail and specular highlight.
[01:09:31.560 --> 01:09:32.640]   You expect we were talking about that earlier,
[01:09:32.640 --> 01:09:35.880]   but like little glith, you know, there's a little detail
[01:09:35.880 --> 01:09:38.280]   across the surface that sometimes is missing
[01:09:38.280 --> 01:09:39.320]   on some of these.
[01:09:39.320 --> 01:09:41.640]   And it's a really hard detail to add in there.
[01:09:41.640 --> 01:09:46.240]   Is it a question of time or technology?
[01:09:46.240 --> 01:09:49.120]   I think it's a little bit of time and, you know,
[01:09:49.120 --> 01:09:50.520]   it's just, I think it's time.
[01:09:50.520 --> 01:09:51.760]   It's just a lot of people's time.
[01:09:51.760 --> 01:09:53.160]   You know, to get it to take it to that.
[01:09:53.160 --> 01:09:55.760]   In other words, we have the technology to do it better,
[01:09:55.760 --> 01:09:57.640]   but it would just take more time to do it.
[01:09:57.640 --> 01:09:59.440]   Quality time, of course, it's really expensively okay.
[01:09:59.440 --> 01:10:00.280]   Yeah, I know.
[01:10:00.280 --> 01:10:03.000]   Yeah, but I mean, I would, I'm sorry, go ahead.
[01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:03.840]   Yeah, go ahead.
[01:10:03.840 --> 01:10:04.680]   No, go ahead.
[01:10:04.680 --> 01:10:06.400]   I would put it this way that, for me,
[01:10:06.400 --> 01:10:08.760]   the reality of it wasn't so much
[01:10:08.760 --> 01:10:12.680]   picking out the light effects and the rendering.
[01:10:12.680 --> 01:10:15.840]   Alex has much, much better eyes than I do for that sort of thing.
[01:10:15.840 --> 01:10:20.120]   For me, it's the idea that they made the same simple,
[01:10:20.120 --> 01:10:23.400]   they made the same simple fundamental choice
[01:10:23.400 --> 01:10:26.320]   at the outset that is essential to great effects
[01:10:26.320 --> 01:10:28.520]   and great graphics, which is if we,
[01:10:28.520 --> 01:10:31.160]   if there were a person with a camera filming this,
[01:10:31.160 --> 01:10:32.480]   how would they shoot that?
[01:10:32.480 --> 01:10:33.920]   How would they get that shot?
[01:10:33.920 --> 01:10:35.280]   How would they move the camera?
[01:10:35.280 --> 01:10:38.200]   Where would they want to be in relation to
[01:10:38.200 --> 01:10:40.240]   where the natural source of light is?
[01:10:40.240 --> 01:10:42.360]   How fast could they move that camera?
[01:10:42.360 --> 01:10:43.600]   Like, what would be able to catch?
[01:10:43.600 --> 01:10:45.680]   What would they, what would they be able to miss?
[01:10:45.680 --> 01:10:48.960]   And, and the idea that all these things they have weight,
[01:10:48.960 --> 01:10:52.000]   they have physics, they have, they have momentum,
[01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:53.680]   that's what really sells it to me.
[01:10:53.680 --> 01:10:56.480]   My problem with a lot of, with a lot of like Hollywood
[01:10:56.480 --> 01:10:59.880]   blockbuster graphics is that at some point,
[01:10:59.880 --> 01:11:02.840]   you can tell where they went from like the live action
[01:11:02.840 --> 01:11:04.640]   with whatever graphic overlay to.
[01:11:04.640 --> 01:11:07.160]   Now you're looking at the full CG version of this
[01:11:07.160 --> 01:11:09.200]   because suddenly like they're,
[01:11:09.200 --> 01:11:12.600]   suddenly this like 800 pound behemoth is filled
[01:11:12.600 --> 01:11:14.640]   with helium suddenly.
[01:11:14.640 --> 01:11:17.280]   I mean, suddenly like, it's had a big camera operator
[01:11:17.280 --> 01:11:19.760]   who's filming this fight from the street corner.
[01:11:19.760 --> 01:11:22.760]   It's like a drone, the sides of like a fly
[01:11:22.760 --> 01:11:26.000]   that can basically go into one nostril that out the ear
[01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:28.560]   because a director thought that'd be an exciting shot.
[01:11:28.560 --> 01:11:30.280]   So it's not, so it's not just the,
[01:11:30.280 --> 01:11:31.960]   the photo realism of one frame.
[01:11:31.960 --> 01:11:36.000]   I love the, the, the discipline restraint they had
[01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:38.400]   in deciding no, our reality is that we are shooting
[01:11:38.400 --> 01:11:40.840]   with this with a camera crew, a documentary camera crew,
[01:11:40.840 --> 01:11:42.960]   it has to look a certain way.
[01:11:42.960 --> 01:11:45.800]   - And I definitely think that that, that,
[01:11:45.800 --> 01:11:48.920]   that realism in camera shots and the approach,
[01:11:48.920 --> 01:11:51.400]   obviously they brought people in that have done
[01:11:51.400 --> 01:11:52.720]   a lot of these kinds of films and said,
[01:11:52.720 --> 01:11:54.280]   this is how we would shoot it and this is how
[01:11:54.280 --> 01:11:55.560]   we're gonna look at it and this is, you know,
[01:11:55.560 --> 01:11:57.280]   this is the where we put the camera.
[01:11:57.280 --> 01:11:59.640]   So I think that those decisions Andy's completely right.
[01:11:59.640 --> 01:12:02.880]   And again, six hours of this kind of content,
[01:12:02.880 --> 01:12:05.480]   that's, you know, three Pixar films, you know,
[01:12:05.480 --> 01:12:07.960]   so I mean, it would be hundreds of millions of dollars
[01:12:07.960 --> 01:12:10.960]   to take it to that, to the next, you know, level
[01:12:10.960 --> 01:12:13.800]   because there's so many CG objects, you know,
[01:12:13.800 --> 01:12:16.440]   so many CG animals in there to manage.
[01:12:16.440 --> 01:12:17.960]   So I understand it, I just, you know,
[01:12:17.960 --> 01:12:19.840]   it was one of those things that I probably,
[01:12:19.840 --> 01:12:22.080]   this is, I keep you, how I look at the world,
[01:12:22.080 --> 01:12:24.200]   but, but the, but I think that, that,
[01:12:24.200 --> 01:12:26.600]   I think that it was, I was, I think that when I saw
[01:12:26.600 --> 01:12:29.320]   the trailer, I think I was like, oh, this is gonna be
[01:12:29.320 --> 01:12:30.560]   like realistic for, you know,
[01:12:30.560 --> 01:12:31.880]   and then when I got to it, I was like, that's good.
[01:12:31.880 --> 01:12:35.120]   And I, I really, I mean, I'm really enjoying it.
[01:12:35.120 --> 01:12:37.040]   You know, and I love prehistoric stuff.
[01:12:37.040 --> 01:12:37.880]   - Just switch.
[01:12:37.880 --> 01:12:40.560]   - I'm gonna watch every, every, I'm gonna watch
[01:12:40.560 --> 01:12:41.400]   every one of these.
[01:12:41.400 --> 01:12:42.240]   - Get the last thing you created.
[01:12:42.240 --> 01:12:43.080]   - Get the last thing you created.
[01:12:43.080 --> 01:12:44.680]   - And just smile and raise it.
[01:12:44.680 --> 01:12:46.040]   - Have a couple of drinks.
[01:12:46.040 --> 01:12:46.880]   - Yeah.
[01:12:46.880 --> 01:12:48.280]   - What I would say is that school, you know,
[01:12:48.280 --> 01:12:50.800]   what, there's a real opportunity, oh, hopefully Apple
[01:12:50.800 --> 01:12:53.880]   will take advantage of this, of making this into,
[01:12:53.880 --> 01:12:56.880]   you know, and they keep on doing things like this.
[01:12:56.880 --> 01:12:59.440]   You know, they could build a curriculum for schools
[01:12:59.440 --> 01:13:01.720]   that, that is, here's a bunch of stuff that you can watch
[01:13:01.720 --> 01:13:03.960]   about dinosaurs that's very, as historically accurate
[01:13:03.960 --> 01:13:05.960]   as we can be about things that lived hundreds of millions
[01:13:05.960 --> 01:13:07.000]   of years ago.
[01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:10.040]   And, oh, and then here's some USDZ models
[01:13:10.040 --> 01:13:11.080]   of the things that you can look at.
[01:13:11.080 --> 01:13:13.320]   And here's a, here's a curriculum that you could use
[01:13:13.320 --> 01:13:14.440]   to teach about those things.
[01:13:14.440 --> 01:13:16.240]   And so you could, you know, really, you know,
[01:13:16.240 --> 01:13:18.920]   add a lot of things that are there,
[01:13:18.920 --> 01:13:20.680]   that they could distribute to schools.
[01:13:20.680 --> 01:13:22.040]   And 'cause schools can't, you know,
[01:13:22.040 --> 01:13:23.120]   they can't afford to do this.
[01:13:23.120 --> 01:13:26.480]   So even, even Pearson can't afford to do what Apple's doing.
[01:13:26.480 --> 01:13:29.560]   So, so I think that it, there's a real opportunity
[01:13:29.560 --> 01:13:31.520]   for Apple to use this as a service back.
[01:13:31.520 --> 01:13:33.560]   Discovery has done this for years, you know,
[01:13:33.560 --> 01:13:36.280]   building, you know, in school, in class curriculum
[01:13:36.280 --> 01:13:37.520]   for a lot of the stuff that they've done.
[01:13:37.520 --> 01:13:40.320]   And so I think that Apple could hopefully do a lot of that
[01:13:40.320 --> 01:13:41.840]   around some of this content.
[01:13:41.840 --> 01:13:44.480]   - Do you, do you know what software they used?
[01:13:44.480 --> 01:13:48.160]   - My guess is probably a mixture of Maya and Houdini.
[01:13:48.160 --> 01:13:50.160]   It was probably, I mean, those are probably the two big apps
[01:13:50.160 --> 01:13:53.080]   that, you know, 'cause Maya, Maya's not, Houdini does things
[01:13:53.080 --> 01:13:53.920]   that nothing else can do.
[01:13:53.920 --> 01:13:56.920]   Like the ocean spray and a lot of the plant life
[01:13:56.920 --> 01:13:57.760]   and everything else.
[01:13:57.760 --> 01:14:00.000]   And I'm just completely guessing I have absolutely no idea.
[01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:00.840]   - Yeah.
[01:14:00.840 --> 01:14:03.520]   - You know, for a fact, Maya is really a,
[01:14:03.520 --> 01:14:05.760]   a core element, you know, it's the,
[01:14:05.760 --> 01:14:07.400]   and then people just build on it.
[01:14:07.400 --> 01:14:09.440]   And so it's, and so you say Maya,
[01:14:09.440 --> 01:14:11.880]   but it's really all the custom software that was built
[01:14:11.880 --> 01:14:15.080]   by whatever visual effects firm built this or did this.
[01:14:15.080 --> 01:14:17.360]   And, but those are the two biggest apps
[01:14:17.360 --> 01:14:19.200]   that would probably use at something at this level.
[01:14:19.200 --> 01:14:22.160]   - Do they use in-house software still a lot, Alex?
[01:14:22.160 --> 01:14:25.200]   - Well, what happened is Maya has become
[01:14:25.200 --> 01:14:26.880]   a lot of people's in-house software.
[01:14:26.880 --> 01:14:29.160]   What happened was, is that Maya was designed really
[01:14:29.160 --> 01:14:31.240]   for the ILM pipeline, which is ILM was like,
[01:14:31.240 --> 01:14:33.240]   we don't need you to build every little piece of skin
[01:14:33.240 --> 01:14:34.520]   or the simulator.
[01:14:34.520 --> 01:14:36.440]   What we need you to do is give us a great core
[01:14:36.440 --> 01:14:38.480]   that we, that you'll keep on updating.
[01:14:38.480 --> 01:14:40.360]   And then we'll build all the plugins onto it.
[01:14:40.360 --> 01:14:43.320]   And so most visual effects firms have kind of built
[01:14:43.320 --> 01:14:44.760]   around all of that.
[01:14:44.760 --> 01:14:47.800]   And so, so they use Maya as a, you know,
[01:14:47.800 --> 01:14:49.720]   a core aspect of it.
[01:14:49.720 --> 01:14:52.160]   And then they, but they're, then they just customize
[01:14:52.160 --> 01:14:53.360]   the, you know, the heck out of it.
[01:14:53.360 --> 01:14:55.600]   So it's, you know, it's, at some point it becomes
[01:14:55.600 --> 01:14:57.960]   20 or 30% Maya and, you know,
[01:14:57.960 --> 01:14:59.920]   but they don't have to worry about that.
[01:14:59.920 --> 01:15:02.160]   But they don't, a renderman's still a thing, you know,
[01:15:02.160 --> 01:15:04.800]   but there's a lot of rendering that is, I mean,
[01:15:04.800 --> 01:15:07.040]   yeah, definitely a renderman's still in the pipeline,
[01:15:07.040 --> 01:15:07.880]   in different pipelines.
[01:15:07.880 --> 01:15:10.440]   But there's a lot of, those are the rendering engines.
[01:15:10.440 --> 01:15:12.160]   So renderman's really a rendering engine.
[01:15:12.160 --> 01:15:14.320]   So it's the thing that draws everything out.
[01:15:14.320 --> 01:15:15.640]   But it's not doing the animation.
[01:15:15.640 --> 01:15:18.120]   It's doing the, it's doing the turning,
[01:15:18.120 --> 01:15:22.600]   turning all that into a, into a finished, finished frame.
[01:15:22.600 --> 01:15:25.520]   - The Wikipedia article says the series had been
[01:15:25.520 --> 01:15:30.000]   in development by the BBC 10 years.
[01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:32.280]   Apple ordered the, or, you know, gave them the money
[01:15:32.280 --> 01:15:34.520]   and ordered the documentary three years ago.
[01:15:34.520 --> 01:15:39.520]   Hans Zimmer does a score, John Favreau is the producer.
[01:15:39.520 --> 01:15:43.400]   The series uses up to date paleontological research
[01:15:43.400 --> 01:15:46.000]   to depict animals of the Cretaceous
[01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:47.640]   with scientific rigor.
[01:15:47.640 --> 01:15:52.760]   In fact, the most modern paleontology says
[01:15:52.760 --> 01:15:54.600]   that dinosaurs were probably covered with feathers.
[01:15:54.600 --> 01:15:58.320]   So you may see a juvenile Tyrannosaurus Rex with feathers.
[01:15:58.320 --> 01:15:59.800]   - Don't my fear of birds are founded.
[01:15:59.800 --> 01:16:00.640]   - Yes.
[01:16:00.640 --> 01:16:04.680]   Paleozoologist Darren Nysh and science illustrator Gabrielle
[01:16:04.680 --> 01:16:07.160]   Yugwetto were consulted for depictions
[01:16:07.160 --> 01:16:08.880]   of the prehistoric life.
[01:16:08.880 --> 01:16:11.040]   The concept art and creature design created
[01:16:11.040 --> 01:16:14.320]   by jellyfish pictures, computer generated imagery
[01:16:14.320 --> 01:16:16.880]   developed by the moving picture company.
[01:16:16.880 --> 01:16:18.480]   They're the folks who did The Lion King
[01:16:18.480 --> 01:16:19.920]   and the Jungle Book, which were, you know,
[01:16:19.920 --> 01:16:24.920]   those photo realistic mix of human live action.
[01:16:24.920 --> 01:16:28.200]   - So something could, came with those two movies, great.
[01:16:28.200 --> 01:16:30.880]   - Yeah. (laughs)
[01:16:30.880 --> 01:16:31.720]   Yeah, fascinating.
[01:16:31.720 --> 01:16:34.360]   I found this article, I was looking for the budget.
[01:16:34.360 --> 01:16:36.440]   What do you think the budget was, Alex?
[01:16:36.440 --> 01:16:41.360]   - I'd be surprised if they ended up spending
[01:16:41.360 --> 01:16:42.720]   more than $100 million on it.
[01:16:42.720 --> 01:16:44.840]   I mean, I think that it's probably somewhere
[01:16:44.840 --> 01:16:46.200]   between $1,600 million.
[01:16:46.200 --> 01:16:48.400]   - It's really more time than money.
[01:16:48.400 --> 01:16:50.280]   - And just rendering time, it's people's time,
[01:16:50.280 --> 01:16:52.080]   it's detailed time, it's, yeah, I mean, it's,
[01:16:52.080 --> 01:16:54.760]   but I think that, you know, I think that I wouldn't be surprised
[01:16:54.760 --> 01:16:58.360]   if they didn't spend 10 million in an episode for it.
[01:16:58.360 --> 01:17:00.040]   - Yeah, it's a lot of development.
[01:17:00.040 --> 01:17:02.280]   - Although compared to, you know,
[01:17:02.280 --> 01:17:06.200]   the next game of Thrones, it's pretty cheap.
[01:17:06.200 --> 01:17:08.560]   - Yeah, I think that--
[01:17:08.560 --> 01:17:09.560]   - What I'd heard is-- - It's like the first
[01:17:09.560 --> 01:17:10.640]   plus, plus, plus. - Dragons are hard.
[01:17:10.640 --> 01:17:12.680]   - Yeah. - I think, and they didn't show
[01:17:12.680 --> 01:17:14.000]   the dragons that often.
[01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:15.320]   And a lot of it was in the dark guys.
[01:17:15.320 --> 01:17:16.160]   - For good reasons, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:17:16.160 --> 01:17:17.160]   - We noticed it. - So good reasons.
[01:17:17.160 --> 01:17:19.920]   - I think that I had heard that the game of Thrones,
[01:17:19.920 --> 01:17:21.440]   except for some of the final ones,
[01:17:21.440 --> 01:17:24.200]   was like eight to 12 million, a copy.
[01:17:25.200 --> 01:17:28.920]   - Apple is looking to create a new creative class.
[01:17:28.920 --> 01:17:31.240]   They've expanded today at Apple Creative Studios
[01:17:31.240 --> 01:17:35.320]   for young creatives, all new creative studio sessions.
[01:17:35.320 --> 01:17:36.640]   Open to the local community.
[01:17:36.640 --> 01:17:39.080]   This is another Apple press release.
[01:17:39.080 --> 01:17:43.240]   Apple will provide mentors,
[01:17:43.240 --> 01:17:45.920]   along with 30 nonprofit community partners.
[01:17:45.920 --> 01:17:49.240]   Books, storytelling, app design, radio, podcasts,
[01:17:49.240 --> 01:17:52.960]   photography, film, and TV participants will receive
[01:17:52.960 --> 01:17:55.560]   hands-on education, training, and feedback.
[01:17:55.560 --> 01:17:57.520]   So they're gonna teach people how to podcast.
[01:17:57.520 --> 01:18:00.000]   Just what we need, more podcasters.
[01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:04.120]   - You know, the, I will say it's still one of the hidden
[01:18:04.120 --> 01:18:08.280]   things that Apple does, or those classes at the Apple stores.
[01:18:08.280 --> 01:18:09.440]   My kids, when they go to LA,
[01:18:09.440 --> 01:18:11.640]   that's what their grandmother takes them to,
[01:18:11.640 --> 01:18:13.920]   like a couple of day, and they just love them,
[01:18:13.920 --> 01:18:16.000]   and they learn so much about their tools.
[01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:17.040]   - Here's-- - They're really well done.
[01:18:17.040 --> 01:18:22.040]   - Here's New York City, Paris, Milan,
[01:18:22.520 --> 01:18:25.440]   Miami, so all over the world, Berlin.
[01:18:25.440 --> 01:18:28.120]   So that's pretty cool.
[01:18:28.120 --> 01:18:30.760]   Yeah, if you happen to be near one,
[01:18:30.760 --> 01:18:32.520]   New York will have app design,
[01:18:32.520 --> 01:18:36.520]   Miami books and storytelling, podcasts, music and radio
[01:18:36.520 --> 01:18:40.040]   will be taught in Berlin, Nashville, Chicago, and Paris,
[01:18:40.040 --> 01:18:43.400]   Taipei, and Milan for art and design, of course.
[01:18:43.400 --> 01:18:45.440]   London, Sydney, Beijing, Tokyo, and Bangkok
[01:18:45.440 --> 01:18:47.880]   for photography, film and TV.
[01:18:47.880 --> 01:18:50.640]   - It's a little too bad that they don't do more virtual.
[01:18:50.640 --> 01:18:51.480]   (laughs)
[01:18:51.480 --> 01:18:54.480]   - Yeah, they can have classes of thousands.
[01:18:54.480 --> 01:18:57.200]   - At least the film one is six weeks.
[01:18:57.200 --> 01:18:58.360]   I don't know how long the other ones are,
[01:18:58.360 --> 01:19:03.360]   but that's six free days for your folks, for your parents.
[01:19:03.360 --> 01:19:06.760]   Get going, send your kids out there right now.
[01:19:06.760 --> 01:19:08.320]   They'll learn something useful.
[01:19:08.320 --> 01:19:12.640]   All right, what is A2657?
[01:19:12.640 --> 01:19:16.440]   The world wants to know, as you know,
[01:19:16.440 --> 01:19:18.840]   if you're gonna release something with radio frequency,
[01:19:18.840 --> 01:19:22.160]   you've gotta go to the FCC, new filings from the FCC,
[01:19:22.160 --> 01:19:24.840]   according to nine to five, Mac reveal a mysterious new,
[01:19:24.840 --> 01:19:28.280]   quote, network adapter from Apple,
[01:19:28.280 --> 01:19:33.280]   code name A2657 that runs iOS 15.5,
[01:19:33.280 --> 01:19:37.260]   two gigabit ethernet ports,
[01:19:37.260 --> 01:19:42.260]   Wi-Fi Bluetooth and NFC antennas, plus a USB-C port.
[01:19:42.260 --> 01:19:46.440]   The accessory features 32 gigs of internal storage,
[01:19:46.440 --> 01:19:50.240]   1.5 gigs of RAM, a second version of the same product
[01:19:50.240 --> 01:19:54.720]   has lightning instead of USB-C and a gig of RAM.
[01:19:54.720 --> 01:19:55.760]   - That's the one for North America,
[01:19:55.760 --> 01:19:57.160]   'cause the EU is not here.
[01:19:57.160 --> 01:19:58.680]   - Oh, could be.
[01:19:58.680 --> 01:19:59.720]   - They're just kidding, but maybe.
[01:19:59.720 --> 01:20:00.680]   - No, that could be.
[01:20:00.680 --> 01:20:02.480]   - No, but, you know.
[01:20:02.480 --> 01:20:04.000]   - It sounds like it's the, I don't know,
[01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:05.000]   what do you think this is?
[01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:06.440]   This is really weird.
[01:20:06.440 --> 01:20:07.640]   What do you think this is?
[01:20:07.640 --> 01:20:08.480]   - Is it the display?
[01:20:08.480 --> 01:20:10.760]   Is it the Mini LED version of the display?
[01:20:10.760 --> 01:20:13.960]   - It's a network adapter, has an integral battery.
[01:20:13.960 --> 01:20:18.960]   It sounds like iPod touch, but I don't think it's that.
[01:20:18.960 --> 01:20:24.120]   I don't know.
[01:20:24.120 --> 01:20:26.280]   There was a lot of discussion recently about,
[01:20:26.280 --> 01:20:28.800]   it's a little bit on this show about how, gosh,
[01:20:28.800 --> 01:20:31.080]   our wish Apple would get back into wireless networking.
[01:20:31.080 --> 01:20:32.720]   - Do you think that's maybe what this is?
[01:20:32.720 --> 01:20:34.400]   - Yeah, this has to be plugged into a computer,
[01:20:34.400 --> 01:20:35.240]   which doesn't make any sense.
[01:20:35.240 --> 01:20:37.000]   - Yeah, exactly, so that's why.
[01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:42.000]   - Yeah, the FCC filings show that it was plugged in,
[01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:43.840]   it is designed to be plugged in.
[01:20:43.840 --> 01:20:45.320]   I don't want to rain on your parades anymore, Leo,
[01:20:45.320 --> 01:20:47.440]   but it also could be something that Apple technicians use
[01:20:47.440 --> 01:20:48.280]   at an Apple store.
[01:20:48.280 --> 01:20:49.120]   - Oh.
[01:20:49.120 --> 01:20:50.640]   - A lot of times some of those filings happen.
[01:20:50.640 --> 01:20:52.760]   So, you know what they can see, it might be,
[01:20:52.760 --> 01:20:53.600]   but it might be a couple of years.
[01:20:53.600 --> 01:20:54.960]   - Yeah, Apple, according to nine and five Mac,
[01:20:54.960 --> 01:20:56.880]   has multiple devices registered with the FCC
[01:20:56.880 --> 01:20:58.800]   they're intended for internal purposes,
[01:20:58.800 --> 01:21:01.560]   tools used by technicians to repair iPhones and Macs.
[01:21:01.560 --> 01:21:03.200]   Oh, never mind.
[01:21:03.200 --> 01:21:04.040]   (laughing)
[01:21:04.040 --> 01:21:05.040]   - Oh, it could be something amazing.
[01:21:05.040 --> 01:21:05.880]   - It could be something good.
[01:21:05.880 --> 01:21:06.720]   - It could be something exciting.
[01:21:06.720 --> 01:21:08.720]   - Yeah, it could be an Apple Capichine on the computer.
[01:21:08.720 --> 01:21:11.520]   - Oh, oh, why fine able Capichine on the computer?
[01:21:11.520 --> 01:21:13.160]   - They gotta send those Apple stores something, right?
[01:21:13.160 --> 01:21:16.800]   - Oh, why buy the curates if you can send them Apple machines?
[01:21:16.800 --> 01:21:20.800]   - Yeah, a machine that can do retina level of detail
[01:21:20.800 --> 01:21:22.800]   on the topic of Capichino for us.
[01:21:22.800 --> 01:21:24.480]   (laughing)
[01:21:24.480 --> 01:21:28.360]   - Apple is, as one would expect, looking to find other places
[01:21:28.360 --> 01:21:31.320]   to make its devices from the Wall Street Journal.
[01:21:31.320 --> 01:21:34.200]   Apple looks to boost production outside China.
[01:21:34.200 --> 01:21:36.800]   iPhone maker tells suppliers it wants to manufacture more
[01:21:36.800 --> 01:21:39.280]   in India and Southeast Asia.
[01:21:41.600 --> 01:21:43.480]   - Yeah, I guess it's just not practical for them
[01:21:43.480 --> 01:21:45.480]   to bring manufacturing home.
[01:21:45.480 --> 01:21:48.040]   - Yeah, also, probably not.
[01:21:48.040 --> 01:21:51.040]   - I'm just gonna say a lot of these markets
[01:21:51.040 --> 01:21:53.040]   are actually demanding local manufacturer.
[01:21:53.040 --> 01:21:54.240]   India is trying to--
[01:21:54.240 --> 01:21:56.200]   - Yeah, India and Brazil both require--
[01:21:56.200 --> 01:21:58.440]   - It'll be made locally, yeah.
[01:21:58.440 --> 01:22:01.040]   - It also gives Apple cover to move out of China.
[01:22:01.040 --> 01:22:02.920]   - Oh, you have an end lever to it.
[01:22:02.920 --> 01:22:05.520]   - You know, like this is, yeah, well, it's some leverage,
[01:22:05.520 --> 01:22:09.200]   but if China does anything towards Taiwan,
[01:22:09.200 --> 01:22:11.200]   this gets really complicated really quickly.
[01:22:11.200 --> 01:22:13.080]   And so a lot of manufacturers are trying to figure out
[01:22:13.080 --> 01:22:17.280]   how to diversify because if we applied the same embargoes,
[01:22:17.280 --> 01:22:19.520]   you know, the same things that are happening to Russia
[01:22:19.520 --> 01:22:22.720]   to China, it would definitely affect Apple's ability
[01:22:22.720 --> 01:22:23.720]   to produce con.
[01:22:23.720 --> 01:22:25.560]   - So of course, the lockdown right now,
[01:22:25.560 --> 01:22:28.240]   the COVID lockdown in Shanghai is holding
[01:22:28.240 --> 01:22:31.120]   a Apple laptops hostage in quantum mix.
[01:22:31.120 --> 01:22:34.200]   - And I think that that's their cover is that they have
[01:22:34.200 --> 01:22:36.000]   a reason to be able to tell China that, well,
[01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:37.960]   you know, you're not able to produce it.
[01:22:37.960 --> 01:22:40.640]   And we need to make sure that we keep on doing our thing,
[01:22:40.640 --> 01:22:43.120]   but I think that a lot of folks are pretty concerned
[01:22:43.120 --> 01:22:48.120]   about China's interest in the South Sea, South Sea.
[01:22:48.120 --> 01:22:52.840]   - People, Wall Street Journal quotes people in the industry
[01:22:52.840 --> 01:22:55.760]   who said many of the reasons Apple has long kept China
[01:22:55.760 --> 01:22:57.720]   as it's manufacturing hub remain in place
[01:22:57.720 --> 01:23:01.200]   at well-trained workforce, low costs relative to the US
[01:23:01.200 --> 01:23:03.440]   and a deep network of parts suppliers
[01:23:03.440 --> 01:23:04.840]   that's hard to recreate elsewhere,
[01:23:04.840 --> 01:23:08.960]   that years of effort, they point out that with the exception
[01:23:08.960 --> 01:23:11.600]   of India, the pool of qualified workers in China
[01:23:11.600 --> 01:23:15.200]   exceeds the entire population of many alternative countries
[01:23:15.200 --> 01:23:16.560]   in Asia.
[01:23:16.560 --> 01:23:19.400]   - Well, and I think that what's stunning is that China
[01:23:19.400 --> 01:23:22.560]   has made it worth their while to move.
[01:23:22.560 --> 01:23:25.520]   I mean, with both, you know, with not to get too much
[01:23:25.520 --> 01:23:27.240]   on apologies, but with both countries, Russia and China,
[01:23:27.240 --> 01:23:28.320]   people just want to do business with them.
[01:23:28.320 --> 01:23:30.600]   If they just didn't, if they weren't rattling sabers
[01:23:30.600 --> 01:23:32.960]   and bullying their neighbors, you know,
[01:23:32.960 --> 01:23:34.360]   people would just keep on working with them.
[01:23:34.360 --> 01:23:36.800]   It's the, it's, these are kind of unforced errors
[01:23:36.800 --> 01:23:38.120]   on those countries because they're--
[01:23:38.120 --> 01:23:39.840]   - Well, it's unforced error on Putin.
[01:23:39.840 --> 01:23:42.320]   But Putin, it didn't have a lot to lose.
[01:23:42.320 --> 01:23:46.960]   I really wonder if China will push Taiwan
[01:23:46.960 --> 01:23:49.160]   or the disputed islands with Japan and so forth
[01:23:49.160 --> 01:23:50.320]   because they're doing a lot of work.
[01:23:50.320 --> 01:23:51.320]   - This is a make-for-the-aconomy.
[01:23:51.320 --> 01:23:53.760]   I know they're making noise, but I, you know,
[01:23:53.760 --> 01:23:56.480]   they're going up to the edge, but I don't know if they're--
[01:23:56.480 --> 01:23:59.040]   - Right, the noise is creating decisions though.
[01:23:59.040 --> 01:24:00.920]   Like that's the problem is if you're not gonna do it,
[01:24:00.920 --> 01:24:03.520]   stop making the noise because they're making noise
[01:24:03.520 --> 01:24:05.920]   that's causing a lot of companies to make decisions.
[01:24:05.920 --> 01:24:07.680]   You know, it's just, it's a really,
[01:24:07.680 --> 01:24:12.320]   and a stunning, a stunning, you know, example of hubris.
[01:24:12.320 --> 01:24:16.040]   - Oh, it's a complicated count goes.
[01:24:16.040 --> 01:24:18.880]   And just a, just the other week,
[01:24:18.880 --> 01:24:21.360]   Russian state nationalized Google's assets
[01:24:21.360 --> 01:24:22.560]   inside the company.
[01:24:22.560 --> 01:24:23.560]   I mean, this is the state--
[01:24:23.560 --> 01:24:26.240]   - The next day, you have bankruptcy in Russia because--
[01:24:26.240 --> 01:24:27.560]   - Yeah, I mean--
[01:24:27.560 --> 01:24:29.600]   - We've got nothing left.
[01:24:29.600 --> 01:24:32.600]   - Yeah, and when you have power that's being,
[01:24:32.600 --> 01:24:34.800]   when you have someone who's basically
[01:24:34.800 --> 01:24:37.320]   naming themselves president for life,
[01:24:37.320 --> 01:24:39.800]   and basically has enough power, enough pull,
[01:24:39.800 --> 01:24:42.360]   and enough influence, and enough names and receipts
[01:24:42.360 --> 01:24:43.640]   to basically make sure that, oh yeah,
[01:24:43.640 --> 01:24:44.920]   well, there was this law that said
[01:24:44.920 --> 01:24:46.960]   that I can't run for another term,
[01:24:46.960 --> 01:24:49.080]   but I propose that we make that,
[01:24:49.080 --> 01:24:50.760]   we make, we abolish that in my case.
[01:24:50.760 --> 01:24:52.160]   The problem is that you then you have someone
[01:24:52.160 --> 01:24:55.320]   who is going to be doing increasingly desperate things
[01:24:55.320 --> 01:24:58.360]   to hold onto power because that's all that they can see,
[01:24:58.360 --> 01:25:00.320]   and they don't like the idea of what happens to them
[01:25:00.320 --> 01:25:01.920]   after they were removed from power.
[01:25:01.920 --> 01:25:06.920]   And so this is how it's easy to imagine
[01:25:06.920 --> 01:25:09.400]   any situation like what's going on in China
[01:25:09.400 --> 01:25:12.040]   eventually devolving into a Putin situation.
[01:25:12.040 --> 01:25:12.840]   - Yeah.
[01:25:12.840 --> 01:25:17.840]   - Although China, the CPC may be making the calculus,
[01:25:17.840 --> 01:25:21.840]   well go ahead, try to make it outside of China.
[01:25:21.840 --> 01:25:22.680]   Let's see how you--
[01:25:22.680 --> 01:25:26.400]   - Oh, well, their economy is starting to feel a bit
[01:25:26.400 --> 01:25:29.840]   of a crash from the real estate crisis.
[01:25:29.840 --> 01:25:33.480]   So this is also a case where we've had passed
[01:25:33.480 --> 01:25:36.000]   a very, very great and in-depth conversations
[01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:37.600]   about Apple's relationship with China,
[01:25:37.600 --> 01:25:39.400]   but one of the things that's very, very positive
[01:25:39.400 --> 01:25:41.840]   is that Apple does have the stability to say that,
[01:25:41.840 --> 01:25:43.520]   look, here's how much money that you're making
[01:25:43.520 --> 01:25:46.400]   from our manufacturing, and here's how much money
[01:25:46.400 --> 01:25:49.680]   you're making from the halo effect of your manufacturing,
[01:25:49.680 --> 01:25:52.960]   being capable of manufacturing stuff to our tolerances.
[01:25:52.960 --> 01:25:55.440]   Why would, if you did something that made it impossible
[01:25:55.440 --> 01:25:58.560]   for us to continue to do business in your country,
[01:25:58.560 --> 01:26:00.160]   how are you gonna be able to deal with that?
[01:26:00.160 --> 01:26:01.440]   Would you rather have our business,
[01:26:01.440 --> 01:26:03.560]   or would you rather have half of our business?
[01:26:03.560 --> 01:26:05.640]   - Well, and which is why it would be hard for Apple
[01:26:05.640 --> 01:26:07.840]   to move out when there wasn't a COVID situation
[01:26:07.840 --> 01:26:08.840]   where they're locking down things
[01:26:08.840 --> 01:26:11.400]   and making it hard for Apple to actually produce.
[01:26:11.400 --> 01:26:13.480]   They'd, Apple would be creating more upset,
[01:26:13.480 --> 01:26:15.400]   but right now, Apple's like, well, we gotta do something
[01:26:15.400 --> 01:26:16.560]   because we don't know.
[01:26:16.560 --> 01:26:17.400]   You know, we have to, you know,
[01:26:17.400 --> 01:26:19.800]   so they have kind of a cover to keep on moving
[01:26:19.800 --> 01:26:21.240]   out of the country because, you know,
[01:26:21.240 --> 01:26:22.200]   China's got a lot of problems.
[01:26:22.200 --> 01:26:26.160]   I mean, they have a stunning birth rate problem
[01:26:26.160 --> 01:26:27.920]   that is going to eventually become a--
[01:26:27.920 --> 01:26:28.760]   - Falling birth. - Massive.
[01:26:28.760 --> 01:26:30.240]   - Falling birth. - Yeah.
[01:26:30.240 --> 01:26:34.040]   - Falling, you know, like two, and they can't turn,
[01:26:34.040 --> 01:26:35.920]   they can't turn the corner on that.
[01:26:35.920 --> 01:26:38.440]   And so they're, you know, so they're becoming top heavy
[01:26:38.440 --> 01:26:41.640]   population-wise, and that's gonna,
[01:26:41.640 --> 01:26:46.480]   that is a massively stabilizing account for them to deal with.
[01:26:46.480 --> 01:26:48.640]   And so, you know, it's gonna,
[01:26:48.640 --> 01:26:51.400]   Apple needs to do something, you know, and diversify.
[01:26:51.400 --> 01:26:53.560]   And I think that they are, and I think that it's smart,
[01:26:53.560 --> 01:26:55.360]   and I think they should keep doing it.
[01:26:56.880 --> 01:26:59.240]   So what do you think of this story
[01:26:59.240 --> 01:27:04.480]   about the woman who dropped her Apple watch
[01:27:04.480 --> 01:27:06.680]   on the Disney Epcot ride
[01:27:06.680 --> 01:27:12.640]   and claims that subsequently there were $40,000
[01:27:12.640 --> 01:27:14.600]   of fraudulent charges?
[01:27:14.600 --> 01:27:15.720]   - I don't know how that's supposed to work.
[01:27:15.720 --> 01:27:17.280]   - I don't know how that would happen.
[01:27:17.280 --> 01:27:18.640]   - Yeah. - Yeah.
[01:27:18.640 --> 01:27:20.960]   Because it locks and you can't lock it
[01:27:20.960 --> 01:27:23.120]   - Because there's more to this story.
[01:27:23.120 --> 01:27:26.080]   Unless her passcode was 11111,
[01:27:26.920 --> 01:27:27.840]   it's only four digits.
[01:27:27.840 --> 01:27:29.360]   Maybe they just accidentally-
[01:27:29.360 --> 01:27:30.720]   - There's no security system in the world
[01:27:30.720 --> 01:27:32.000]   that can overcome humans.
[01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:32.840]   - Yeah.
[01:27:32.840 --> 01:27:35.640]   So what if her password was 11111?
[01:27:35.640 --> 01:27:37.000]   I mean, I would believe this.
[01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:38.160]   This woman dropped the watch,
[01:27:38.160 --> 01:27:40.320]   she was fidgeting with her watch
[01:27:40.320 --> 01:27:43.240]   on these seas with Nemo and friends attraction.
[01:27:43.240 --> 01:27:46.200]   Her husband jumped off, she could see it,
[01:27:46.200 --> 01:27:48.160]   it had fallen through a grate.
[01:27:48.160 --> 01:27:50.040]   Her husband jumped off,
[01:27:50.040 --> 01:27:51.560]   tried to fish it out of the grate,
[01:27:51.560 --> 01:27:53.960]   which of course immediately stopped the ride.
[01:27:53.960 --> 01:27:56.320]   And they were escorted out.
[01:27:56.320 --> 01:28:00.560]   The watch did not get returned to them,
[01:28:00.560 --> 01:28:04.080]   even though she felt like the Disney employees
[01:28:04.080 --> 01:28:06.640]   could see it as could they.
[01:28:06.640 --> 01:28:09.000]   She said, "Several credit cards linked to the watch,
[01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:11.000]   including an American Express card
[01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:13.880]   with an unlimited credit line."
[01:28:13.880 --> 01:28:14.760]   I bet you it was.
[01:28:14.760 --> 01:28:19.760]   So if it was 11111 and some lucky Disney cast member
[01:28:19.760 --> 01:28:23.200]   figured that out, could you put it on?
[01:28:23.200 --> 01:28:25.680]   Type 11111 and then buy stuff.
[01:28:25.680 --> 01:28:27.960]   But how would you buy $40,000?
[01:28:27.960 --> 01:28:28.960]   You'd have to buy a boat.
[01:28:28.960 --> 01:28:29.800]   - Disney.
[01:28:29.800 --> 01:28:30.640]   - A Disney.
[01:28:30.640 --> 01:28:31.720]   - Or a couple of dinners, can't afford one.
[01:28:31.720 --> 01:28:32.640]   - A couple of dinners at Disney.
[01:28:32.640 --> 01:28:33.720]   - Yeah.
[01:28:33.720 --> 01:28:35.720]   - Oh, they got that $6,000 tonight.
[01:28:35.720 --> 01:28:38.200]   - I think that's actually a cosplay experience.
[01:28:38.200 --> 01:28:40.040]   - I think it's like, I think that's actually just
[01:28:40.040 --> 01:28:43.120]   general tickets for a few of them with six.
[01:28:43.120 --> 01:28:44.240]   - That's about 40 rides,
[01:28:44.240 --> 01:28:46.000]   so the rides are the resistance.
[01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:46.840]   - Exactly.
[01:28:46.840 --> 01:28:50.020]   - There is no word of what the thief bought.
[01:28:52.320 --> 01:28:53.880]   It was an Hermes watch too, Leo.
[01:28:53.880 --> 01:28:56.760]   It was like a 13 or $700 watch.
[01:28:56.760 --> 01:28:58.920]   - Now I know you guys don't read nine to five Google.
[01:28:58.920 --> 01:28:59.760]   Well, maybe you do Andy,
[01:28:59.760 --> 01:29:02.280]   'cause you do a show called Material All About,
[01:29:02.280 --> 01:29:03.120]   you know that kind of thing.
[01:29:03.120 --> 01:29:04.040]   And maybe you do Renee,
[01:29:04.040 --> 01:29:05.960]   'cause they just hired Max Weinbach.
[01:29:05.960 --> 01:29:06.800]   - Oh, really?
[01:29:06.800 --> 01:29:07.640]   Nice.
[01:29:07.640 --> 01:29:09.040]   - Yeah, nice.
[01:29:09.040 --> 01:29:11.400]   - Pixel watch will have USB charging cable
[01:29:11.400 --> 01:29:16.400]   and shares the same manufacturer as the Apple watch.
[01:29:16.400 --> 01:29:17.640]   - Second part, I don't care.
[01:29:17.640 --> 01:29:19.480]   First part is super interesting to me.
[01:29:19.480 --> 01:29:21.240]   'Cause usually they don't put ports in,
[01:29:21.240 --> 01:29:22.760]   well, I don't know about all the Android wear watches,
[01:29:22.760 --> 01:29:24.560]   but like for a swim proofing a watch,
[01:29:24.560 --> 01:29:25.840]   ports makes it super complicated.
[01:29:25.840 --> 01:29:30.320]   - Yeah, I mean, my Galaxy watch has a puck,
[01:29:30.320 --> 01:29:31.760]   just like the Apple watch, really.
[01:29:31.760 --> 01:29:35.480]   On the back, maybe that's what they mean.
[01:29:35.480 --> 01:29:39.040]   Taiwan's Compaul Electronics will manufacture
[01:29:39.040 --> 01:29:43.320]   the Pixel watch, which they also manufacture the Apple watch.
[01:29:43.320 --> 01:29:45.200]   - Yeah, there's a bunch of controversy
[01:29:45.200 --> 01:29:47.360]   because a lot of people were excited that,
[01:29:47.360 --> 01:29:50.400]   oh, finally we've had faith that at some point,
[01:29:50.400 --> 01:29:52.040]   Google would make an actual Pixel watch
[01:29:52.040 --> 01:29:55.920]   and suddenly Wear OS would not stink again.
[01:29:55.920 --> 01:29:58.640]   But then the later update is that,
[01:29:58.640 --> 01:30:03.640]   oh, actually it's gonna be using the same CPU as like 2020,
[01:30:03.640 --> 01:30:07.560]   I think, edition of the Samsung Galaxy watch,
[01:30:07.560 --> 01:30:10.920]   which may be a problem, but might not be
[01:30:10.920 --> 01:30:13.400]   because maybe they'll optimize it,
[01:30:13.400 --> 01:30:15.360]   they'll add co-processors to make it work.
[01:30:15.360 --> 01:30:17.640]   It seems to have the same fitness sensors
[01:30:17.640 --> 01:30:21.640]   as the Fitbit Charge 5 or something
[01:30:21.640 --> 01:30:23.000]   that's already on the market.
[01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:25.480]   We'll have to, we'll still have to find out.
[01:30:25.480 --> 01:30:28.440]   It's, I mean, it's, they have such a long way to go.
[01:30:28.440 --> 01:30:30.920]   They just, they have such a long way to go.
[01:30:30.920 --> 01:30:32.840]   - Google has a weird thing, go ahead, I'm sorry.
[01:30:32.840 --> 01:30:34.400]   - Oh, sorry, I was gonna say, Google has this weird thing.
[01:30:34.400 --> 01:30:35.240]   Some companies have this weird thing
[01:30:35.240 --> 01:30:36.520]   where if a product is delayed,
[01:30:36.520 --> 01:30:38.520]   they don't feel like they can take the time
[01:30:38.520 --> 01:30:41.240]   to refresh it to whatever the next year's specs are
[01:30:41.240 --> 01:30:42.840]   because that'll just delay it further.
[01:30:42.840 --> 01:30:44.800]   And if it's not already in a high speed production line,
[01:30:44.800 --> 01:30:46.560]   they'll be like, like, Apple watches and iPhones
[01:30:46.560 --> 01:30:48.000]   are like falling off the treadmill,
[01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:49.760]   like all the time, they're just falling off.
[01:30:49.760 --> 01:30:51.400]   And you've got to keep them updated.
[01:30:51.400 --> 01:30:52.240]   But these companies are like,
[01:30:52.240 --> 01:30:54.320]   "Ah, we didn't make this release and it's gonna be out
[01:30:54.320 --> 01:30:55.840]   "but it's gonna be older specs and if we,
[01:30:55.840 --> 01:30:57.800]   "but if we update it, it's gonna be another year out
[01:30:57.800 --> 01:30:59.400]   "and then those specs will be outdated."
[01:30:59.400 --> 01:31:01.880]   And they end up falling into almost a year one trap.
[01:31:01.880 --> 01:31:03.320]   They fix it all in year two,
[01:31:03.320 --> 01:31:05.960]   but it just, it hurts that initial product so much.
[01:31:05.960 --> 01:31:10.680]   - Yeah, and the thing is, speaking as somebody who's been,
[01:31:10.680 --> 01:31:14.280]   I've got a drawer full of Android Wear watches
[01:31:14.280 --> 01:31:16.280]   that I keep buying just to make sure
[01:31:16.280 --> 01:31:18.120]   that I have one in the library that can test
[01:31:18.120 --> 01:31:19.360]   like modern stuff on,
[01:31:19.360 --> 01:31:21.720]   but none of it has made like the daily driver
[01:31:21.720 --> 01:31:22.720]   on my wrist sort of thing.
[01:31:22.720 --> 01:31:24.320]   I mean, the closest that I've come
[01:31:24.320 --> 01:31:27.280]   is just a regular Fitbit charge because,
[01:31:27.280 --> 01:31:29.040]   I mean, the battery life is great.
[01:31:29.040 --> 01:31:31.240]   It does the basics of what I wanted to do
[01:31:31.240 --> 01:31:32.920]   and it's actually being supported
[01:31:32.920 --> 01:31:36.240]   and there's no like, crafter's stupidage on top of it.
[01:31:36.240 --> 01:31:37.080]   And it's affordable.
[01:31:37.080 --> 01:31:38.800]   I'm not spending $250 on something
[01:31:38.800 --> 01:31:41.120]   that is gonna be probably wiped away
[01:31:41.120 --> 01:31:44.720]   when the etch a sketch for Wear a West gets shaken once again.
[01:31:44.720 --> 01:31:46.720]   - Really, but Google's biggest problem,
[01:31:46.720 --> 01:31:47.640]   especially compared to Apple,
[01:31:47.640 --> 01:31:49.240]   is just they don't know how to say,
[01:31:49.240 --> 01:31:51.080]   look, at some point you gotta make a decision
[01:31:51.080 --> 01:31:52.120]   and then keep moving forward.
[01:31:52.120 --> 01:31:53.640]   You can't just simply,
[01:31:53.640 --> 01:31:56.000]   you can't just simply like go back to the start line
[01:31:56.000 --> 01:31:56.800]   and start all over again,
[01:31:56.800 --> 01:31:57.920]   which is they're, they're,
[01:31:57.920 --> 01:31:59.920]   they're go to for a whole bunch of different projects
[01:31:59.920 --> 01:32:01.720]   they do, including Wear a West.
[01:32:01.720 --> 01:32:03.560]   - It's this weird thing too, where it's kind of noble,
[01:32:03.560 --> 01:32:05.240]   but they seem to feel like they don't deserve
[01:32:05.240 --> 01:32:08.440]   to have integration because they also license out this stuff
[01:32:08.440 --> 01:32:10.160]   and it's unfair to OEMs,
[01:32:10.160 --> 01:32:12.360]   but they go, they bend over backwards to integrate
[01:32:12.360 --> 01:32:13.200]   with the OEMs.
[01:32:13.200 --> 01:32:16.320]   They have whole teams of people working to help OEMs
[01:32:16.320 --> 01:32:17.320]   and like for a long time,
[01:32:17.320 --> 01:32:19.000]   they wouldn't let the Pixel phone team really work
[01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:20.640]   with the Android team because it was unfair,
[01:32:20.640 --> 01:32:22.120]   but meanwhile the Android team was working
[01:32:22.120 --> 01:32:24.800]   with all the other OEMs, so it was unfair to Pixel
[01:32:24.800 --> 01:32:26.600]   and now it feels like they're not letting them work
[01:32:26.600 --> 01:32:28.280]   with Fitbit to the extent that,
[01:32:28.280 --> 01:32:30.000]   that I want to Google to do with Fitbit
[01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:31.400]   because they bought them now,
[01:32:31.400 --> 01:32:32.240]   and they're like, but you know,
[01:32:32.240 --> 01:32:34.600]   we can't really integrate fully because it wouldn't really be,
[01:32:34.600 --> 01:32:36.360]   no, please do that.
[01:32:36.360 --> 01:32:37.280]   - I know, but I think that that's
[01:32:37.280 --> 01:32:39.160]   that Google's problem is just constantly concerned
[01:32:39.160 --> 01:32:40.280]   about antitrust, you know,
[01:32:40.280 --> 01:32:41.520]   it's a constant problem
[01:32:41.520 --> 01:32:43.880]   and every time they start to blend those together,
[01:32:43.880 --> 01:32:46.040]   they get themselves in trouble.
[01:32:46.040 --> 01:32:47.960]   Like that's the challenge for them.
[01:32:47.960 --> 01:32:51.120]   - I think you're right, that's part of the challenge.
[01:32:51.120 --> 01:32:52.800]   I think mostly institutionally,
[01:32:52.800 --> 01:32:53.960]   I do think they have a problem
[01:32:53.960 --> 01:32:55.720]   of getting all their ducks in a row.
[01:32:55.720 --> 01:32:57.800]   I wish I could say that, oh no,
[01:32:57.800 --> 01:32:59.680]   they're being very, very cautious, but no,
[01:32:59.680 --> 01:33:01.520]   time and time and time again,
[01:33:01.520 --> 01:33:05.280]   if you're lucky, the ambitious project that got canceled
[01:33:05.280 --> 01:33:06.880]   will result in some basic technologies
[01:33:06.880 --> 01:33:09.240]   that will be rolled into the thing that replaces it,
[01:33:09.240 --> 01:33:10.880]   but that doesn't change the fact that,
[01:33:10.880 --> 01:33:13.080]   suddenly you're, you suddenly have to do Google Wallet
[01:33:13.080 --> 01:33:15.320]   when they're two years ago, they're telling you about Google Pay
[01:33:15.320 --> 01:33:17.280]   and you're now doing Google Duo
[01:33:17.280 --> 01:33:19.400]   when they used to say, oh no, Google Chat,
[01:33:19.400 --> 01:33:21.120]   it's kind of embarrassing for coming this.
[01:33:21.120 --> 01:33:23.000]   - Is that something to tell them again?
[01:33:23.000 --> 01:33:23.840]   - Yeah.
[01:33:23.840 --> 01:33:26.400]   - The institutional fear of failure is not existent.
[01:33:26.400 --> 01:33:27.240]   - Right.
[01:33:27.240 --> 01:33:31.040]   - I was impressed though that the Pixel 7 looks like
[01:33:31.040 --> 01:33:32.600]   it's gonna actually build on a Pixel 6
[01:33:32.600 --> 01:33:34.600]   because for so many years, the new Pixel felt like
[01:33:34.600 --> 01:33:36.880]   an utter repudiation of the one that came before.
[01:33:36.880 --> 01:33:38.760]   It's like, no, you were an idiot for buying that one.
[01:33:38.760 --> 01:33:40.000]   This time we're gonna do it right.
[01:33:40.000 --> 01:33:41.680]   But like for the first time the Pixel 7 looks like
[01:33:41.680 --> 01:33:43.600]   a linearist successor to the Pixel 6
[01:33:43.600 --> 01:33:44.960]   and there's just so much advantage
[01:33:44.960 --> 01:33:46.400]   to updating something year over year,
[01:33:46.400 --> 01:33:49.800]   so much learned wisdom and platforming, like advancement to it.
[01:33:49.800 --> 01:33:52.160]   - I wasn't surprised, I'll end this
[01:33:52.160 --> 01:33:54.120]   because I know that we're talking about Google stuff
[01:33:54.120 --> 01:33:55.800]   instead of Apple stuff, but I mean,
[01:33:55.800 --> 01:33:57.720]   it takes about two or three years to design
[01:33:57.720 --> 01:33:59.680]   and ship a brand new phone from the ground up.
[01:33:59.680 --> 01:34:01.560]   Given how upset they were internally
[01:34:01.560 --> 01:34:04.160]   about how the Pixel 4 was developed,
[01:34:04.160 --> 01:34:07.640]   I kind of thought that the 5 would be sort of a stopgap
[01:34:07.640 --> 01:34:09.680]   and the 6 would be whatever form it took,
[01:34:09.680 --> 01:34:10.760]   would be the first one where they said,
[01:34:10.760 --> 01:34:12.880]   no, we're gonna build a new phone from the ground up
[01:34:12.880 --> 01:34:17.520]   with 2020, 2021, 2022 sensibilities
[01:34:17.520 --> 01:34:18.520]   and we're gonna make it stick,
[01:34:18.520 --> 01:34:19.800]   we're gonna have an actual strategy
[01:34:19.800 --> 01:34:22.120]   and it's a damn good phone, it's still my daily driver
[01:34:22.120 --> 01:34:24.320]   and I don't regret one tiny bit
[01:34:24.320 --> 01:34:26.120]   buying it instead of an iPhone last year.
[01:34:26.120 --> 01:34:29.360]   - We all know the icon factory,
[01:34:29.360 --> 01:34:33.760]   they've been around in Apple space since 1996.
[01:34:33.760 --> 01:34:36.160]   A great company, one of the founders,
[01:34:36.160 --> 01:34:38.520]   one of the three founders passed away this week
[01:34:38.520 --> 01:34:40.520]   the age of 54 after a two year battle
[01:34:40.520 --> 01:34:42.600]   with Cancer Corey B. Mary
[01:34:42.600 --> 01:34:45.960]   and my memorialized here at the icon factory's website.
[01:34:45.960 --> 01:34:50.880]   So a long time ever of the Apple and Mac community.
[01:34:50.880 --> 01:34:53.080]   - It changed the Mac and the Windows world.
[01:34:53.080 --> 01:34:55.360]   - Yeah, they did, I didn't realize there's a hundred,
[01:34:55.360 --> 01:34:57.720]   over a hundred icons for Windows XP.
[01:34:57.720 --> 01:35:03.360]   They did the icons for Paramount's Star Trek film.
[01:35:03.360 --> 01:35:06.360]   - Yeah, that really is such an art too.
[01:35:07.960 --> 01:35:11.800]   I mean, their influence is deep and wide
[01:35:11.800 --> 01:35:15.760]   and they really inspired a lot of people to rethink UI,
[01:35:15.760 --> 01:35:20.520]   to rethink the communicative effect of icons.
[01:35:20.520 --> 01:35:23.120]   They really just took the ball that Susan Care created
[01:35:23.120 --> 01:35:24.520]   and just ran with it.
[01:35:24.520 --> 01:35:28.240]   - And they also created, I think many think
[01:35:28.240 --> 01:35:30.920]   the best Twitter app of all time, Twitterific.
[01:35:30.920 --> 01:35:32.320]   Craig thought of it in the shower.
[01:35:32.320 --> 01:35:33.160]   - Did he really?
[01:35:33.160 --> 01:35:34.000]   - Wow.
[01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:34.840]   - That's what he says.
[01:35:34.840 --> 01:35:35.680]   - Wow.
[01:35:35.680 --> 01:35:37.760]   - At least you knew their apps would have good icons.
[01:35:37.760 --> 01:35:39.240]   That's for sure.
[01:35:39.240 --> 01:35:40.680]   - Nea's great, X-Gop is great.
[01:35:40.680 --> 01:35:42.680]   So many of their stuff is so foundational.
[01:35:42.680 --> 01:35:44.440]   - Yeah, well Nea's a new one.
[01:35:44.440 --> 01:35:46.680]   This is a sketch tool.
[01:35:46.680 --> 01:35:47.520]   - Yeah.
[01:35:47.520 --> 01:35:48.360]   - Really good.
[01:35:48.360 --> 01:35:49.880]   - Yeah, oh, I love that.
[01:35:49.880 --> 01:35:55.080]   All right, so there you go.
[01:35:55.080 --> 01:35:57.840]   I hate to end on a sad note, but there you have it.
[01:35:57.840 --> 01:36:00.120]   We will come back with, what a legacy.
[01:36:00.120 --> 01:36:01.520]   What a legacy, exactly.
[01:36:01.520 --> 01:36:02.600]   - Yeah, yeah, what a legacy looks on.
[01:36:02.600 --> 01:36:06.120]   - We'll come back with your picks of the week.
[01:36:06.120 --> 01:36:08.840]   In a moment, gentlemen, I wanna talk to anybody,
[01:36:08.840 --> 01:36:13.160]   any company that uses Slack and wants to be more secure.
[01:36:13.160 --> 01:36:16.480]   We've got a great solution for you called Collide.
[01:36:16.480 --> 01:36:17.760]   And I bet you're hearing about it
[01:36:17.760 --> 01:36:20.480]   because there's a lot of buzz around Collide.
[01:36:20.480 --> 01:36:23.480]   Collide came from security practitioners
[01:36:23.480 --> 01:36:27.320]   who realized that MDM Mobile Device Management
[01:36:27.320 --> 01:36:31.640]   was just not working in their businesses.
[01:36:31.640 --> 01:36:34.320]   You know, you'd put MDM on a endpoint,
[01:36:34.320 --> 01:36:36.320]   whether it's a laptop or a smartphone
[01:36:36.320 --> 01:36:38.600]   and users get so frustrated
[01:36:38.600 --> 01:36:40.160]   that they would throw up their hands
[01:36:40.160 --> 01:36:43.080]   and just switch to using their personal devices
[01:36:43.080 --> 01:36:46.960]   without telling anyone, which is worse than anything of all,
[01:36:46.960 --> 01:36:48.320]   especially if they bring that laptop
[01:36:48.320 --> 01:36:50.280]   then back into the office infected.
[01:36:50.280 --> 01:36:52.560]   There's gotta be a better way.
[01:36:52.560 --> 01:36:55.120]   They came up with something I think a lot better, Collide,
[01:36:55.120 --> 01:36:58.200]   K-O-L-I-D, instead of locking down a device,
[01:36:58.200 --> 01:37:00.000]   gluing the USB ports,
[01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:03.440]   Collide gets your users involved.
[01:37:03.440 --> 01:37:06.560]   It teaches them, it enables them,
[01:37:06.560 --> 01:37:08.560]   it makes them feel good about what they're doing,
[01:37:08.560 --> 01:37:09.760]   feel good about security.
[01:37:09.760 --> 01:37:13.400]   And when they understand why the security is so important,
[01:37:13.400 --> 01:37:15.600]   they do a better job.
[01:37:15.600 --> 01:37:18.680]   Collide is, you actually set it up,
[01:37:18.680 --> 01:37:21.640]   the onboarding process is a collide process.
[01:37:21.640 --> 01:37:23.840]   Their first Slack message will say,
[01:37:23.840 --> 01:37:25.440]   "Hello, I'm Collide.
[01:37:25.440 --> 01:37:28.280]   "Let's get you started by installing the endpoint agent."
[01:37:28.280 --> 01:37:31.760]   It'll explain what Collide does
[01:37:31.760 --> 01:37:34.320]   and from there, Collide will regularly send employees
[01:37:34.320 --> 01:37:36.440]   Slack recommendations when their device
[01:37:36.440 --> 01:37:38.320]   is in an insecure state.
[01:37:38.320 --> 01:37:40.560]   It can be simple things like the screen lock
[01:37:40.560 --> 01:37:41.640]   not set up properly.
[01:37:41.640 --> 01:37:44.040]   And look at the messages on the website
[01:37:44.040 --> 01:37:45.560]   'cause they're really great.
[01:37:45.560 --> 01:37:49.200]   They make you feel like you're a partner in security
[01:37:49.200 --> 01:37:50.680]   and that's kind of what you want.
[01:37:50.680 --> 01:37:53.240]   You don't want an adversary inside the company.
[01:37:53.240 --> 01:37:56.520]   You've got enough adversaries outside the company.
[01:37:56.520 --> 01:37:59.200]   It also will do some pretty sophisticated things.
[01:37:59.200 --> 01:38:01.360]   For instance, asking people to secure
[01:38:01.360 --> 01:38:03.040]   those two factor backup codes
[01:38:03.040 --> 01:38:05.600]   sitting in their downloads folders, plain text.
[01:38:05.600 --> 01:38:08.800]   It's talking directly to employees,
[01:38:08.800 --> 01:38:11.040]   educating them about company policies
[01:38:11.040 --> 01:38:14.240]   and how to keep their device secure
[01:38:14.240 --> 01:38:17.960]   using real examples, not theoretical scenarios.
[01:38:17.960 --> 01:38:19.840]   It's, I think, brilliant.
[01:38:19.840 --> 01:38:20.960]   And I think you will too.
[01:38:20.960 --> 01:38:23.440]   Cross-platform endpoint management
[01:38:23.440 --> 01:38:26.680]   for teams that use Slack, Linux, Macs, Windows,
[01:38:26.680 --> 01:38:27.960]   doesn't matter.
[01:38:27.960 --> 01:38:29.840]   It puts the end user first.
[01:38:29.840 --> 01:38:32.480]   And I know sometimes you go,
[01:38:32.480 --> 01:38:35.240]   "I don't want my end users to have control."
[01:38:35.240 --> 01:38:37.600]   But if you get them to be on your team
[01:38:37.600 --> 01:38:41.600]   and securing it with you, they do a much better job.
[01:38:41.600 --> 01:38:45.160]   This is endpoint management that puts the user first.
[01:38:45.160 --> 01:38:46.280]   Really a brilliant idea.
[01:38:46.280 --> 01:38:47.560]   Visit collide.
[01:38:47.560 --> 01:38:50.440]   K-O-L-I-D-E.com/Macbreak.

[01:38:56.840 --> 01:39:00.800]   I think you'll really see how different Collide is
[01:39:00.800 --> 01:39:03.560]   from any other kind of security system.

[01:39:13.320 --> 01:39:14.400]   after signing up for the trial.
[01:39:14.400 --> 01:39:15.720]   I gotta do, I forgot to do that.
[01:39:15.720 --> 01:39:16.960]   I gotta get the stickers.
[01:39:16.960 --> 01:39:19.440]   That's a way of saying thank you.
[01:39:19.440 --> 01:39:23.640]   Collide.K-O-L-I-D-E.com/Macbreak.
[01:39:23.640 --> 01:39:25.080]   I love this idea.
[01:39:25.080 --> 01:39:26.480]   I really do.
[01:39:26.480 --> 01:39:27.320]   Collide.
[01:39:27.320 --> 01:39:29.680]   We thank them for their support.
[01:39:29.680 --> 01:39:33.600]   Renee Ritchie, your pick of the week, my friend.
[01:39:33.600 --> 01:39:35.800]   - So my pick of the week, unappressed is by saying
[01:39:35.800 --> 01:39:39.400]   that Reddit has always been at war with mobile browsers.
[01:39:39.400 --> 01:39:41.360]   They just make it so miserable.
[01:39:41.360 --> 01:39:43.600]   If you see a link to reddit.com
[01:39:43.600 --> 01:39:45.320]   and you tap on it, it's gonna demand
[01:39:45.320 --> 01:39:46.680]   that you download their app,
[01:39:46.680 --> 01:39:48.240]   then you try to go to the website
[01:39:48.240 --> 01:39:49.720]   and then it doesn't let you do things
[01:39:49.720 --> 01:39:52.200]   and you ask for the desktop version of the site
[01:39:52.200 --> 01:39:53.800]   and it makes the text eight feet wide
[01:39:53.800 --> 01:39:56.280]   so you can't get even like one word on a single line.
[01:39:56.280 --> 01:39:58.440]   You try to do anything, you try to comment, you scroll,
[01:39:58.440 --> 01:39:59.600]   you click through to something, it says,
[01:39:59.600 --> 01:40:01.080]   "No, you need the mobile app to see this."
[01:40:01.080 --> 01:40:02.440]   You're like, it is just,
[01:40:02.440 --> 01:40:03.800]   it might as well not even be a website.
[01:40:03.800 --> 01:40:05.760]   It is like the anti-web, the real dark web,
[01:40:05.760 --> 01:40:07.000]   the evil web, something.
[01:40:07.000 --> 01:40:10.680]   It is terrible, but there is an app called Apollo.
[01:40:10.680 --> 01:40:11.680]   - Yay! - Which makes it
[01:40:11.680 --> 01:40:14.400]   a genuinely joyful experience.
[01:40:14.400 --> 01:40:15.400]   - I live out of Apollo. - It is so good.
[01:40:15.400 --> 01:40:17.200]   - I love it, love it. - Me too.
[01:40:17.200 --> 01:40:20.000]   Yeah, Christian, the designer is so good, Canadian,
[01:40:20.000 --> 01:40:22.280]   but other than that, he's fantastic.
[01:40:22.280 --> 01:40:24.040]   He puts so much care and consideration into it
[01:40:24.040 --> 01:40:26.560]   and he's just released Apollo 1.13,
[01:40:26.560 --> 01:40:27.880]   which sounds very incremental,
[01:40:27.880 --> 01:40:31.280]   but nothing with Apollo or with Christian is incremental.
[01:40:31.280 --> 01:40:34.520]   So it's got like a completely new design for notifications.
[01:40:34.520 --> 01:40:37.400]   It's got a watch function for subreddits
[01:40:37.400 --> 01:40:39.440]   so that you can tell it what sort of things
[01:40:39.440 --> 01:40:41.880]   you're looking for and it'll surface those to you
[01:40:41.880 --> 01:40:43.240]   so you don't have time to go through everything.
[01:40:43.240 --> 01:40:44.640]   You can just sort of highlight the things
[01:40:44.640 --> 01:40:47.400]   that mattered you the most and they'll find them for you.
[01:40:47.400 --> 01:40:49.280]   It's got trending subreddit posts,
[01:40:49.280 --> 01:40:52.080]   remind me so if you wanna go back and see something,
[01:40:52.080 --> 01:40:53.960]   completely rebuilt notifications like I said
[01:40:53.960 --> 01:40:55.720]   and of course because Apollo,
[01:40:55.720 --> 01:40:57.760]   it's got a whole new set of icons,
[01:40:57.760 --> 01:41:01.080]   but I love it so much because it makes me not hate Reddit
[01:41:01.080 --> 01:41:03.160]   on mobile again forever always.
[01:41:03.160 --> 01:41:06.280]   - I live in Apollo on my iPad mini.
[01:41:06.280 --> 01:41:09.600]   It's Nirvana, it's heaven, it's the only way.
[01:41:09.600 --> 01:41:11.640]   - Yes. - You just love it.
[01:41:11.640 --> 01:41:13.440]   - It's non-toxic. - Non-toxic.
[01:41:13.440 --> 01:41:14.800]   - It's flabric acid that Reddit would want
[01:41:14.800 --> 01:41:17.040]   a toxic experience on mobile because that's where
[01:41:17.040 --> 01:41:18.120]   a lot of people, 'cause like,
[01:41:18.120 --> 01:41:19.680]   mobile's great because you have a few seconds,
[01:41:19.680 --> 01:41:20.720]   you wanna check a subreddit,
[01:41:20.720 --> 01:41:22.080]   you wanna check a thread, you wanna do something
[01:41:22.080 --> 01:41:25.400]   and it's so frustrating and then I become like,
[01:41:25.400 --> 01:41:26.360]   like obstructionist, right?
[01:41:26.360 --> 01:41:27.280]   I don't wanna download their app
[01:41:27.280 --> 01:41:28.640]   because they're gonna force it on me.
[01:41:28.640 --> 01:41:31.160]   So I'm just not gonna do it, so Reddit is so Apollo,
[01:41:31.160 --> 01:41:32.320]   it's like no way, Sis.
[01:41:32.320 --> 01:41:36.880]   - Apollo's free, there is an Apollo pro one time option
[01:41:36.880 --> 01:41:39.360]   of $5, then Apollo-- - I thought it was
[01:41:39.360 --> 01:41:40.800]   so easy, my idea. - I did that too.
[01:41:40.800 --> 01:41:44.320]   And then Apollo Ultra, which is a dollar a month,
[01:41:44.320 --> 01:41:47.640]   which is an incredible dealer, $10 a year
[01:41:47.640 --> 01:41:50.840]   and I think it's worth supporting Christian's work
[01:41:50.840 --> 01:41:53.360]   because it is easily, I've tried them all,
[01:41:53.360 --> 01:41:56.320]   it's easily the best Reddit experience out there.
[01:41:56.320 --> 01:41:57.320]   And if you live on Reddit-- - You're telling
[01:41:57.320 --> 01:41:58.640]   a developer really cares.
[01:41:58.640 --> 01:41:59.920]   - Yeah, yeah. - And he really does.
[01:41:59.920 --> 01:42:00.920]   - And you know what's interesting
[01:42:00.920 --> 01:42:04.560]   is how much his users love him, you know?
[01:42:04.560 --> 01:42:05.640]   - Yeah, it's like-- - Well, we have
[01:42:05.640 --> 01:42:07.680]   deservedly so long. - Yeah, it's really interesting
[01:42:07.680 --> 01:42:10.640]   to see, this is one of those apps where people just go,
[01:42:10.640 --> 01:42:13.480]   yes, yes, yes, it's a really good Apollo app.
[01:42:13.480 --> 01:42:14.640]   - It's like that Steve Jobs line,
[01:42:14.640 --> 01:42:16.640]   like a glass of ice water in hell.
[01:42:16.640 --> 01:42:19.000]   Like he's really, he does give me a glass of Reddit
[01:42:19.000 --> 01:42:21.160]   ice water in the hell of their mobile experience.
[01:42:21.160 --> 01:42:26.160]   - Yeah, and Reddit is now my favorite social system,
[01:42:26.160 --> 01:42:29.280]   outside of our own Twit.community forums
[01:42:29.280 --> 01:42:31.480]   and Twit.social mastodon.
[01:42:31.480 --> 01:42:33.400]   Apollo's fantastic and of course our Discord
[01:42:33.400 --> 01:42:34.760]   for our club members.
[01:42:34.760 --> 01:42:37.000]   Andy, not go pick of the week.
[01:42:37.000 --> 01:42:38.680]   - Yeah, a tip and a pick that I actually
[01:42:38.680 --> 01:42:41.520]   could very much relate it to what Renee was talking about
[01:42:41.520 --> 01:42:43.880]   that I love my iPad Pro.
[01:42:43.880 --> 01:42:45.680]   It's one of my primary devices.
[01:42:45.680 --> 01:42:47.400]   The only thing that's really, really annoying
[01:42:47.400 --> 01:42:50.280]   is when the simplest thing,
[01:42:50.280 --> 01:42:52.800]   I want to do something in the web browser,
[01:42:52.800 --> 01:42:55.120]   but something on that site like Reddit says,
[01:42:55.120 --> 01:42:56.720]   oh, wait a minute, I have an app.
[01:42:56.720 --> 01:42:57.880]   Why don't you install my app?
[01:42:57.880 --> 01:43:00.440]   I won't let you, oh, oh, you need to sign in
[01:43:00.440 --> 01:43:01.760]   and validate that you're above 18.
[01:43:01.760 --> 01:43:03.480]   Oh, well, we can't do that in the web,
[01:43:03.480 --> 01:43:04.880]   we can't do that in the app.
[01:43:04.880 --> 01:43:08.080]   And so many sites just don't work well that way.
[01:43:08.080 --> 01:43:10.560]   And that's the one stumbling block.
[01:43:10.560 --> 01:43:13.560]   And so the weirdest thing is that,
[01:43:13.560 --> 01:43:15.880]   so I do have Safari and Chrome installed
[01:43:15.880 --> 01:43:17.560]   and a couple other browsers installed.
[01:43:17.560 --> 01:43:19.360]   I primarily use Safari and Chrome.
[01:43:19.360 --> 01:43:21.600]   The weird thing is though, that I use Safari
[01:43:21.600 --> 01:43:24.280]   every time I want to use Google Docs on my iPad,
[01:43:24.280 --> 01:43:26.840]   because when they do it on Chrome,
[01:43:26.840 --> 01:43:29.920]   Google is smarter to say, oh, no, no, no, you don't want to use it.
[01:43:29.920 --> 01:43:32.800]   You don't want to use Google Docs in the browser.
[01:43:32.800 --> 01:43:34.080]   You want to use it in the,
[01:43:34.080 --> 01:43:36.440]   here's a promo page where you can download the app.
[01:43:36.440 --> 01:43:39.440]   And the app isn't nearly as good as the web version of it.
[01:43:39.440 --> 01:43:40.920]   And that's what I want.
[01:43:40.920 --> 01:43:44.480]   So Safari makes it very, very easy to surface,
[01:43:44.480 --> 01:43:48.880]   just through default settings panel in the settings app,
[01:43:48.880 --> 01:43:52.320]   just say, give me the desktop version of everything
[01:43:52.320 --> 01:43:53.640]   that you fetch for me.
[01:43:53.640 --> 01:43:55.600]   And suddenly, every one of these problems
[01:43:55.600 --> 01:43:56.720]   is immediately solved.
[01:43:56.720 --> 01:43:58.960]   You no longer get, you get the classic Reddit.
[01:43:58.960 --> 01:44:02.200]   You don't get the super, super wide stretched version.
[01:44:02.200 --> 01:44:04.800]   I don't know why so many sites give me
[01:44:04.800 --> 01:44:06.760]   the super stretched version, because of course,
[01:44:06.760 --> 01:44:08.560]   it's an iPad, it's only been out for 10 years.
[01:44:08.560 --> 01:44:09.480]   It must be a phone.
[01:44:09.480 --> 01:44:12.000]   Let's give you the phone layout.
[01:44:12.000 --> 01:44:17.000]   With Chrome, the only way around it is to go to the incredibly
[01:44:17.000 --> 01:44:20.120]   intuitive interface that they have for user settings,
[01:44:20.120 --> 01:44:25.160]   which is to enter the URL, Chrome colon slash slash flags.
[01:44:25.160 --> 01:44:27.360]   And then they will give you a list inside the browser
[01:44:27.360 --> 01:44:29.800]   of settings, and halfway during the middle of it,
[01:44:29.800 --> 01:44:33.440]   is one where you can flick it to the fetch desktop settings,
[01:44:33.440 --> 01:44:37.760]   desktop desktop web pages by default,
[01:44:37.760 --> 01:44:40.120]   and then when you restart it works.
[01:44:40.120 --> 01:44:41.280]   So that's the tip.
[01:44:41.280 --> 01:44:45.000]   The pick is this really cool Safari plugin
[01:44:45.000 --> 01:44:48.240]   that attacks another piece of mobile pain
[01:44:48.240 --> 01:44:52.560]   when you're using an iPad, which is Google AMP pages.
[01:44:52.560 --> 01:44:56.280]   Those are five years, six years ago, seven years ago.
[01:44:56.280 --> 01:44:59.520]   Google had this really great idea that G mobile data
[01:44:59.520 --> 01:45:01.680]   is really, really slow, and it's really, really expensive.
[01:45:01.680 --> 01:45:04.800]   Let's create this new standard so that if someone is
[01:45:04.800 --> 01:45:06.880]   connecting to your website via mobile device,
[01:45:06.880 --> 01:45:08.840]   you can actually create through code
[01:45:08.840 --> 01:45:11.640]   that we've developed and then put into the open source
[01:45:11.640 --> 01:45:13.720]   a sort of slimmed down version of the page
[01:45:13.720 --> 01:45:15.280]   that will load really, really fast.
[01:45:15.280 --> 01:45:18.960]   Unfortunately, this is 2022, and I've got a really good
[01:45:18.960 --> 01:45:21.640]   fast connection, I've got a really good fast iPad,
[01:45:21.640 --> 01:45:24.640]   and I don't want that stripped version of the page,
[01:45:24.640 --> 01:45:27.160]   and I don't want the extra tracking,
[01:45:27.160 --> 01:45:28.720]   because the URLs will go through Google
[01:45:28.720 --> 01:45:31.200]   to resolve that page.
[01:45:31.200 --> 01:45:34.440]   So there's a really good plugin for Safari on iOS
[01:45:34.440 --> 01:45:38.520]   called Amplosion AMP, LOSIO and cost two bucks.
[01:45:38.520 --> 01:45:41.400]   You install this plugin and suddenly, anytime that you do
[01:45:41.400 --> 01:45:45.400]   a Google search and I'm not unbeknownst to you,
[01:45:45.400 --> 01:45:47.840]   you've tapped on a link to what turns out to be an AMP page,
[01:45:47.840 --> 01:45:50.400]   it will automatically fetch the actual
[01:45:50.400 --> 01:45:53.720]   HTTP standard HTML page instead.
[01:45:53.720 --> 01:45:55.600]   Nice. Simple, effective two bucks.
[01:45:55.600 --> 01:45:57.040]   Amplosion.
[01:45:57.040 --> 01:45:58.840]   Yeah.
[01:45:58.840 --> 01:46:02.800]   Mr. Alex Lindsay, your pick of the week.
[01:46:02.800 --> 01:46:05.840]   This is one of my best picks in a long time.
[01:46:05.840 --> 01:46:06.720]   I'm just letting people know.
[01:46:06.720 --> 01:46:07.880]   Oh my God.
[01:46:07.880 --> 01:46:08.880]   Here's the worst part of this.
[01:46:08.880 --> 01:46:10.280]   It's gonna cost you.
[01:46:10.280 --> 01:46:11.560]   No, it's not that expensive, even.
[01:46:11.560 --> 01:46:13.080]   It's not even very expensive.
[01:46:13.080 --> 01:46:17.080]   It's a week ago, I didn't even know what this app was.
[01:46:17.080 --> 01:46:21.240]   So it was, and we, I kind of understood it
[01:46:21.240 --> 01:46:23.840]   when we scheduled them to come in this morning for,
[01:46:23.840 --> 01:46:25.840]   I moved my other pick the next week,
[01:46:25.840 --> 01:46:27.640]   because this was amazing.
[01:46:27.640 --> 01:46:32.640]   Like we had, so we had Gabe Cohen come in
[01:46:32.640 --> 01:46:36.440]   from audio desk, this audio design desk,
[01:46:36.440 --> 01:46:38.880]   and what this does, it's insane.
[01:46:38.880 --> 01:46:41.720]   It connects to Final Cut, it also connects,
[01:46:41.720 --> 01:46:43.480]   it connects the best to Final Cut,
[01:46:43.480 --> 01:46:45.560]   it also connects to Premiere and Pro Tools
[01:46:45.560 --> 01:46:46.400]   and all these other things.
[01:46:46.400 --> 01:46:47.240]   And what it does is it's for,
[01:46:47.240 --> 01:46:48.280]   when you're doing audio design,
[01:46:48.280 --> 01:46:50.960]   so you have sound effects, you have music,
[01:46:50.960 --> 01:46:53.960]   you have different beats that you wanna put in,
[01:46:53.960 --> 01:46:57.280]   and it basically supercharges your ability
[01:46:57.280 --> 01:46:59.680]   to add all those effects really fast.
[01:46:59.680 --> 01:47:03.600]   So it can, it has 50,000 effects or whatever,
[01:47:03.600 --> 01:47:05.680]   and music clips and so on and so forth,
[01:47:05.680 --> 01:47:08.960]   and they're starting to tie into external services as well.
[01:47:08.960 --> 01:47:12.160]   And so what happens is that it builds its own little interface,
[01:47:12.160 --> 01:47:13.320]   and you're watching and you say,
[01:47:13.320 --> 01:47:15.000]   "Oh, I'm looking for a swoosh,
[01:47:15.000 --> 01:47:16.280]   "or I'm looking for footsteps,
[01:47:16.280 --> 01:47:18.040]   "or I'm looking for this."
[01:47:18.040 --> 01:47:18.920]   And it just puts it in there,
[01:47:18.920 --> 01:47:21.120]   and you can literally tie it to a keyboard
[01:47:21.120 --> 01:47:23.640]   so that you can play it while you're watching.
[01:47:23.640 --> 01:47:25.360]   So you can have like a bunch of sword things
[01:47:25.360 --> 01:47:27.280]   and be hitting the, if you remember the keys,
[01:47:27.280 --> 01:47:28.200]   you could be sitting there,
[01:47:28.200 --> 01:47:30.200]   like doing the demo this morning,
[01:47:30.200 --> 01:47:34.360]   he was doing a sword fight from Crouching Tiger.
[01:47:34.360 --> 01:47:36.560]   And they're like, (imitates swoosh)
[01:47:36.560 --> 01:47:38.480]   and he's adding all of it in real time.
[01:47:38.480 --> 01:47:40.920]   And then you have these effects
[01:47:40.920 --> 01:47:43.240]   and you can swap through those effects really fast.
[01:47:43.240 --> 01:47:44.960]   Like, "Oh, that's not really the one I'm looking for.
[01:47:44.960 --> 01:47:46.160]   "Give me another one, give me another one,
[01:47:46.160 --> 01:47:47.160]   "give me another one."
[01:47:47.160 --> 01:47:48.440]   And it'll keep on going through that.
[01:47:48.440 --> 01:47:52.040]   And what it does is it not only puts those audio in,
[01:47:52.040 --> 01:47:54.520]   if you have your marker or your cursor
[01:47:54.520 --> 01:47:56.040]   where you want that effect to go in,
[01:47:56.040 --> 01:47:59.440]   it knows what part of that effect it has metadata in it.
[01:47:59.440 --> 01:48:01.600]   That's where it should hit on the edit point.
[01:48:01.600 --> 01:48:03.320]   And this is, 'cause it's really designed by someone
[01:48:03.320 --> 01:48:05.080]   who's actually done this.
[01:48:05.080 --> 01:48:06.760]   You know, it was like, this is how you save time.
[01:48:06.760 --> 01:48:10.760]   It literally is one of the most amazing extensions
[01:48:10.760 --> 01:48:12.840]   for Final Cut I've ever seen in my entire life.
[01:48:12.840 --> 01:48:16.000]   You know, and it just the amount of time,
[01:48:16.000 --> 01:48:17.160]   any of us that have done this,
[01:48:17.160 --> 01:48:20.640]   have had to add music, had to add sound effects
[01:48:20.640 --> 01:48:21.480]   and so on and so forth,
[01:48:21.480 --> 01:48:23.200]   know that you never get, you never finish,
[01:48:23.200 --> 01:48:24.480]   you just run out of time.
[01:48:24.480 --> 01:48:28.920]   And this literally makes it a hundred times faster.
[01:48:28.920 --> 01:48:31.920]   So it, I was, all of us were,
[01:48:31.920 --> 01:48:34.760]   I mean, literally almost all of us in the panels
[01:48:34.760 --> 01:48:39.440]   this morning were completely just having trouble
[01:48:39.440 --> 01:48:41.120]   remembering what we were going to do
[01:48:41.120 --> 01:48:41.960]   the rest of the show.
[01:48:41.960 --> 01:48:45.160]   I screwed up, I screwed up my clothes.
[01:48:45.160 --> 01:48:46.480]   Like, I've never had this problem.
[01:48:46.480 --> 01:48:47.520]   Like, so someone's having a great,
[01:48:47.520 --> 01:48:48.520]   oh, this is a really great product.
[01:48:48.520 --> 01:48:50.880]   And, you know, we've had great other folks on,
[01:48:50.880 --> 01:48:53.560]   but we were literally having trouble asking the questions,
[01:48:53.560 --> 01:48:54.600]   having trouble, 'cause we were thinking about
[01:48:54.600 --> 01:48:56.440]   all the things we were gonna do.
[01:48:56.440 --> 01:48:58.400]   Just stunning, stunning.
[01:48:58.400 --> 01:49:00.760]   And I was like, how have they been around for two years?
[01:49:00.760 --> 01:49:01.600]   And I didn't know that they were,
[01:49:01.600 --> 01:49:04.480]   'cause we'd ask for these very obscure, weird things.
[01:49:04.480 --> 01:49:05.320]   Like, what can I do this?
[01:49:05.320 --> 01:49:06.640]   And they're like, oh yeah, yeah, I can do that.
[01:49:06.640 --> 01:49:08.560]   You can just add all these things to it.
[01:49:08.560 --> 01:49:10.200]   And yeah, I think at some point I was like,
[01:49:10.200 --> 01:49:11.200]   how long have you guys been around?
[01:49:11.200 --> 01:49:12.440]   'Cause how do I not know about this?
[01:49:12.440 --> 01:49:16.920]   And so anyway, so that's why I'm recommending it.
[01:49:16.920 --> 01:49:18.920]   And you should, if you wanna see more about what it did,
[01:49:18.920 --> 01:49:21.480]   'cause I think that their website is a little,
[01:49:21.480 --> 01:49:23.800]   I couldn't really get what it did,
[01:49:23.800 --> 01:49:26.080]   looking at their website,
[01:49:26.080 --> 01:49:27.640]   but you should watch the first hour,
[01:49:27.640 --> 01:49:31.920]   or second hour from today, Tuesdays, office hours,
[01:49:31.920 --> 01:49:34.280]   because you will be entertained.
[01:49:34.280 --> 01:49:36.840]   Like it is, it's a great demo
[01:49:36.840 --> 01:49:40.120]   of a very cool extension, an app.
[01:49:40.120 --> 01:49:40.960]   And so--
[01:49:40.960 --> 01:49:43.400]   - Looks like a fully artist dream come true.
[01:49:43.400 --> 01:49:44.280]   - Yeah.
[01:49:44.280 --> 01:49:45.120]   - Oh my goodness.
[01:49:45.120 --> 01:49:47.320]   And the stuff that they hint to where they're going,
[01:49:47.320 --> 01:49:51.440]   where it's really providing this access for people
[01:49:51.440 --> 01:49:52.880]   to get into a marketplace and everything else,
[01:49:52.880 --> 01:49:54.920]   it's really stunning and really amazing.
[01:49:54.920 --> 01:49:57.720]   I would highly recommend checking out that website.
[01:49:57.720 --> 01:50:00.600]   And it's 30 bucks, I think you can get it perpetual.
[01:50:00.600 --> 01:50:01.960]   I don't know what the perpetual was,
[01:50:01.960 --> 01:50:04.160]   the most expensive version of this
[01:50:04.160 --> 01:50:05.480]   that has absolutely everything,
[01:50:05.480 --> 01:50:07.080]   I think is like 30 bucks a month.
[01:50:07.080 --> 01:50:08.720]   And it goes down from there.
[01:50:08.720 --> 01:50:11.960]   And it's really cool.
[01:50:11.960 --> 01:50:13.280]   So it's one of the coolest things
[01:50:13.280 --> 01:50:15.240]   I've seen in quite a while on the Mac.
[01:50:15.240 --> 01:50:17.120]   - Neat, really nice.
[01:50:17.120 --> 01:50:18.320]   - You want lightsaber sounds now?
[01:50:18.320 --> 01:50:19.160]   - Yeah.
[01:50:19.160 --> 01:50:21.200]   - They have them, they have the lightsaber sounds.
[01:50:21.200 --> 01:50:22.640]   He had all these,
[01:50:22.640 --> 01:50:24.760]   the things he had all the crouching tire one,
[01:50:24.760 --> 01:50:26.280]   they had all these sword,
[01:50:26.280 --> 01:50:27.120]   and then he goes,
[01:50:27.120 --> 01:50:28.640]   - We'll push it and then it's full.
[01:50:28.640 --> 01:50:29.640]   - We can just select all these
[01:50:29.640 --> 01:50:30.800]   and just change them to lightsabers.
[01:50:30.800 --> 01:50:32.040]   And boom, it was lightsabers.
[01:50:32.040 --> 01:50:34.160]   That was like, all of us were taking it.
[01:50:34.160 --> 01:50:35.000]   - Wow.
[01:50:35.000 --> 01:50:36.240]   - Yeah, it's cool.
[01:50:36.240 --> 01:50:38.640]   - I just said a link to Salt Hank,
[01:50:38.640 --> 01:50:40.240]   'cause I think he could probably use this in his video.
[01:50:40.240 --> 01:50:41.080]   - Oh yeah.
[01:50:41.080 --> 01:50:42.400]   - Oh yeah.
[01:50:42.400 --> 01:50:44.800]   - I watch that fight like at least once a month,
[01:50:44.800 --> 01:50:46.200]   you know, there is no movement without stillness.
[01:50:46.200 --> 01:50:48.080]   There is, and he's just like whittling away at her
[01:50:48.080 --> 01:50:49.200]   with the sword as he's moving forward.
[01:50:49.200 --> 01:50:50.440]   It's so good.
[01:50:50.440 --> 01:50:51.440]   - Yeah.
[01:50:51.440 --> 01:50:53.680]   - A-D-D-D-D-P.
[01:50:53.680 --> 01:50:54.800]   - You want a great URL.
[01:50:54.800 --> 01:50:55.640]   - Yeah.
[01:50:55.640 --> 01:51:00.640]   - Very easy URL, A-D-D-D-D-P for audio, design, desk.
[01:51:00.640 --> 01:51:03.280]   And if you want to watch this conversation,
[01:51:03.280 --> 01:51:05.440]   go to officehours.global.
[01:51:05.440 --> 01:51:07.680]   That's where Alex Lindsay lives.
[01:51:07.680 --> 01:51:11.000]   I mean, really quite literally day in, day out,
[01:51:11.000 --> 01:51:15.800]   all sorts of subjects, mostly about production,
[01:51:15.800 --> 01:51:18.880]   but other things too, including cooking,
[01:51:20.480 --> 01:51:23.920]   and it's a Zoom meeting that is always open,
[01:51:23.920 --> 01:51:27.120]   but the mornings are when you have your special events
[01:51:27.120 --> 01:51:31.360]   and so forth, and it's open to all officehours.global
[01:51:31.360 --> 01:51:34.560]   if you want to know more, and if you want to hire Alex,
[01:51:34.560 --> 01:51:39.560]   absolutely, you must go to 090.media,
[01:51:39.560 --> 01:51:42.800]   where he is waiting for your check.
[01:51:42.800 --> 01:51:45.880]   (laughing)
[01:51:45.880 --> 01:51:48.400]   Doesn't matter what it's for, just write it now.
[01:51:48.400 --> 01:51:49.440]   Give him a blank check.
[01:51:49.440 --> 01:51:51.000]   - I'm telling you, it's worth it.
[01:51:51.000 --> 01:51:54.280]   - So suffice to say that next week,
[01:51:54.280 --> 01:51:57.160]   we will have about every third minute
[01:51:57.160 --> 01:51:59.200]   is going to be unnecessary sound effects
[01:51:59.200 --> 01:52:00.480]   that we're just putting through our microphones
[01:52:00.480 --> 01:52:02.560]   'cause they're playing this in really cool.
[01:52:02.560 --> 01:52:04.800]   (laughing)
[01:52:04.800 --> 01:52:07.060]   (laughing)
[01:52:07.060 --> 01:52:11.240]   - And Iraka, what are you gonna be on GBH in Boston
[01:52:11.240 --> 01:52:14.960]   with your APP design desk, ready to go?
[01:52:14.960 --> 01:52:19.160]   - I am off again this week because we're on tape
[01:52:19.160 --> 01:52:21.040]   because there was unfortunately a positive
[01:52:21.040 --> 01:52:23.280]   COVID diagnosis from the host,
[01:52:23.280 --> 01:52:26.400]   and so they're going on tape for the rest of the week.
[01:52:26.400 --> 01:52:29.800]   But I'll be on next week, my usual slot,
[01:52:29.800 --> 01:52:34.160]   but actually one day earlier, Thursday at 12.50 pm,
[01:52:34.160 --> 01:52:36.520]   as usual go to www.bgbhnews.org,
[01:52:36.520 --> 01:52:37.520]   listen to it live or later,
[01:52:37.520 --> 01:52:38.880]   or listen to anything I've done there
[01:52:38.880 --> 01:52:39.840]   for the past three years.
[01:52:39.840 --> 01:52:44.000]   - Nice, always a pleasure, indeed.
[01:52:44.000 --> 01:52:47.000]   - And Renee Richie is at youtube.com/ReneeRitchie.
[01:52:47.000 --> 01:52:49.560]   What are you working on these days?
[01:52:49.560 --> 01:52:52.520]   - I'm working on a video about WWDC that contains
[01:52:52.520 --> 01:52:54.240]   no leaks, no rumors, no speculation,
[01:52:54.240 --> 01:52:57.320]   nothing about what could actually be shown at WWDC,
[01:52:57.320 --> 01:52:59.280]   but just everything about WWDC.
[01:52:59.280 --> 01:53:02.040]   And I'm enjoying Twitter because they're busy beaming
[01:53:02.040 --> 01:53:04.720]   the new poster art into a Power Rangers revival
[01:53:04.720 --> 01:53:07.800]   because it looks so similar to that classic
[01:53:07.800 --> 01:53:09.160]   my missing host. - That's hysterical,
[01:53:09.160 --> 01:53:09.960]   that's funny.
[01:53:09.960 --> 01:53:12.000]   Wow, thank you Renee.
[01:53:12.000 --> 01:53:12.840]   - Yeah.
[01:53:12.840 --> 01:53:15.960]   - We have some events coming up in the club
[01:53:15.960 --> 01:53:17.960]   if you're a club twit member.
[01:53:17.960 --> 01:53:19.960]   Stacey's book club is June 16th.
[01:53:19.960 --> 01:53:20.960]   It's gonna be termination shock.
[01:53:20.960 --> 01:53:22.960]   I'm telling you now 'cause it's a big book.
[01:53:22.960 --> 01:53:24.960]   You're gonna wanna start right now.
[01:53:24.960 --> 01:53:29.960]   Neil Stevenson's latest 9 a.m. Pacific, June 16th.
[01:53:29.960 --> 01:53:34.960]   And certain Alex Lindsey will be our guest in July
[01:53:34.960 --> 01:53:37.960]   for an AMA, Ant Pruitt will interview Alex,
[01:53:37.960 --> 01:53:39.960]   give you a chance to ask your questions.
[01:53:39.960 --> 01:53:41.960]   So if you've always wanted to ask Alex
[01:53:41.960 --> 01:53:44.960]   some personal questions, that's the place to go.
[01:53:44.960 --> 01:53:48.960]   Club Twit is kind of our special place
[01:53:48.960 --> 01:53:51.960]   for people who wanna support what we do here,
[01:53:51.960 --> 01:53:54.960]   $7 a month gets you all of our shows ad free.

[01:53:56.960 --> 01:53:59.960]   You also get access to the Twit Plus feed,
[01:53:59.960 --> 01:54:01.960]   which is all sorts of stuff that doesn't make it
[01:54:01.960 --> 01:54:04.960]   to the podcasts and our fabulous Discord,
[01:54:04.960 --> 01:54:09.960]   which is a conversation of all kinds of stuff.
[01:54:09.960 --> 01:54:12.960]   It's not just the shows, it's everything geeks are interested
[01:54:12.960 --> 01:54:16.960]   in from travel to anime to data science to cooking.
[01:54:16.960 --> 01:54:18.960]   It's a really fun place to hang.
[01:54:18.960 --> 01:54:21.960]   It's my favorite social network.
[01:54:21.960 --> 01:54:25.960]   Highly encourage a visit to twit.tv/clubtwit.

[01:54:27.960 --> 01:54:30.960]   $7 a month, I think it's worth it.
[01:54:30.960 --> 01:54:32.960]   Thanks to all of you for being here.
[01:54:32.960 --> 01:54:34.960]   We do Mac Break Weekly Tuesdays,

[01:54:59.960 --> 01:55:01.960]   You can all, I don't know what's going on,
[01:55:01.960 --> 01:55:03.960]   it's a little teeny weeny YouTube.
[01:55:03.960 --> 01:55:05.960]   You can also, you can also subscribe.
[01:55:05.960 --> 01:55:06.960]   That's probably the best thing to do.
[01:55:06.960 --> 01:55:08.960]   That way you'll get the audio or the video version of the show,
[01:55:08.960 --> 01:55:10.960]   your choice, the minute it's available.
[01:55:10.960 --> 01:55:13.960]   If your podcast platform allows for reviews,

[01:55:19.960 --> 01:55:21.960]   Thank you, Andy. Thank you, Renee.
[01:55:21.960 --> 01:55:22.960]   Thank you, Alex.
[01:55:22.960 --> 01:55:24.960]   I hope there's more news next week.
[01:55:24.960 --> 01:55:25.960]   We'll see.
[01:55:25.960 --> 01:55:27.960]   If not, they'll be good conversation.
[01:55:27.960 --> 01:55:28.960]   I could promise that.
[01:55:28.960 --> 01:55:29.960]   We did pretty good.
[01:55:29.960 --> 01:55:30.960]   Yeah, we did all right.
[01:55:30.960 --> 01:55:31.960]   See you next time.
[01:55:31.960 --> 01:55:34.960]   Now get back to work because break time is over.
