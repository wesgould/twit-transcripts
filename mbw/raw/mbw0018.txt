[00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:26.040]   This is MacRae Weekly, episode 18 for December 7, 2006.
[00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:27.800]   Swing in the rubber chicken.
[00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:31.280]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:48.640]   Hey, everybody.
[00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:50.960]   This is Alex, and we are here.
[00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:54.120]   We've got Scott born in Brook--
[00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:55.360]   I see I want to say Brook Harbor.
[00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:55.880]   I don't know why.
[00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:57.280]   It's Gig Harbor.
[00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:58.280]   It's still Gig Harbor.
[00:00:58.280 --> 00:00:59.160]   It's still Gig Harbor.
[00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:04.160]   It hasn't become Tetra Harbor or Peta Harbor yet.
[00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:08.840]   Nor is it Brooklyn or Brookhaven or anything like that.
[00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:12.640]   Now, Scott, you said you got a new toy in the house?
[00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:16.560]   Well, I got a new mixer that BSW sent over for me to play with.
[00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:21.760]   But my newest toy is actually my brand spanking new MacBook Pro
[00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:26.240]   Core 2 Duo 17-inch with three gigs of RAM.
[00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:28.080]   It finally showed up.
[00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:29.280]   It finally showed up.
[00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.680]   And let me tell you, it is one cool little puppy.
[00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:34.440]   And it's very, very, very nice.
[00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:35.080]   It's fast.
[00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:36.040]   I can tell it's faster.
[00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:38.840]   This is one of these few times you can actually tell it's faster.
[00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:40.120]   The screen-- I don't know.
[00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:43.160]   It just seems like three times brighter than my last one,
[00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.960]   for some reason.
[00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:45.680]   And I'm digging it.
[00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:48.240]   I got a Firewire 800 port, finally.
[00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.600]   Does it go to sleep?
[00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:52.240]   It goes to sleep anytime you ask it.
[00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:53.920]   My MacBook Pro doesn't go to sleep.
[00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:56.320]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:59.120]   Here's the thing is I patched my MacBook Pro
[00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:02.600]   so that it would not turn off automatically.
[00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:05.440]   And now it doesn't ever turn off automatically by itself.
[00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:06.320]   But it won't go to sleep.
[00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:07.680]   It's not a patch like the kernel.
[00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:08.120]   What?
[00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:09.760]   Yeah, I did that little kernel patch.
[00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:10.280]   Oh, my gosh.
[00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:11.880]   And now about half the time.
[00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:15.560]   And it only randomly turned off once in my entire history
[00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:16.400]   of my thing.
[00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:21.640]   And now, about 50% of the time, my MacBook Pro won't go to sleep.
[00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:24.400]   So I get to my house and it's all hot.
[00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:25.840]   Battery's dead.
[00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:28.680]   But your 17-inch is going to sleep, Scott.
[00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:31.440]   My 17-inch will go to sleep, although I just did that
[00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:33.240]   as a test, knowing you were having trouble.
[00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:35.760]   I can't actually leave it sleep because when I run Pro
[00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:38.600]   tools on it, that makes Pro tools unhappy.
[00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:41.520]   But otherwise, it is a wonderful machine,
[00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:45.000]   despite the fact that it costs an arm and away.
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.840]   Now, and it also means that you now
[00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:49.120]   have to-- I believe you're now going
[00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:51.520]   to have to fly first class all the time.
[00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:52.520]   I guess you--
[00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:56.200]   Well, I fly first class in my brand new 2006 Chevy
[00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:57.920]   and Palette SS anywhere I want to go.
[00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:58.920]   Oh, well, there you go.
[00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:00.080]   OK.
[00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:02.800]   I mostly think about how computers will affect my flying
[00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:03.400]   schedule.
[00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:06.280]   And unless I'm willing to fly first class all the time,
[00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:07.600]   I've been afraid of the 17-inch.
[00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:08.200]   That's been my answer.
[00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:12.120]   And just for the record, I have not flown coach since 1996.
[00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:14.000]   Wow.
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:19.800]   I'm too horizontally challenged to even think about that.
[00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:21.440]   Yeah, good.
[00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:25.120]   Now, we also have in the studio, we've got John Foster.
[00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:26.200]   Hello, everybody.
[00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:28.880]   I've been practicing my voice since last night.
[00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:29.920]   You've been practicing your voice?
[00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:30.280]   Yeah.
[00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:33.960]   Well, I was drinking IPA, Racer 5, and smoking cigars,
[00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:37.480]   and staying outside in the cold until the wee.
[00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:40.280]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:41.720]   So John's been prepping his voice.
[00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:44.440]   We also have Merlin in the house.
[00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:45.000]   Hello, Alex.
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:45.880]   Merlin, man.
[00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:47.760]   I spoke to cigars today, so I feel especially
[00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:48.640]   ready for the show tonight.
[00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:51.400]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:54.160]   See, oddly enough, that's not what I smoke when I get ready
[00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:55.320]   for the show.
[00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:56.120]   It's just not the same.
[00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:56.600]   Really?
[00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:57.600]   No.
[00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:59.600]   So all right, kids, keep it clean.
[00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:01.680]   Hey, you can't see this, Scott,
[00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:04.520]   but I'm very proud of the office.
[00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:08.920]   So we finally got the Sonics up on the walls.
[00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:09.960]   It's dead to me.
[00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:10.560]   It's dead.
[00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:12.240]   It's dead to John.
[00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:13.000]   So we don't have--
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:14.600]   Now are we talking the back office?
[00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:15.480]   This is the back office.
[00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:17.840]   Yeah, the back office now has Sonics in most of the walls.
[00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:18.960]   I didn't put it around all the walls,
[00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:21.400]   because I didn't want it to get too dead.
[00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:22.160]   I wanted to leave it with--
[00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:22.840]   That's very cool.
[00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:23.640]   I'm glad to hear that.
[00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:25.560]   Anyway, I just thought I'd let you know.
[00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:28.760]   It's something that we're very excited about.
[00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:31.960]   So anyway, what's on the top of the list?
[00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:33.560]   New beta parallels.
[00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:35.080]   A new beta of parallels.
[00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:38.760]   Now, this is-- this one, the big thing about this,
[00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:43.360]   from what I understand, is that you can now open stuff--
[00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:44.880]   you can go through parallels to bootcamp.
[00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:45.400]   Is that correct?
[00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:46.400]   How does that work?
[00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:51.000]   You can use your bootcamp partition for parallels.
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:56.080]   So that means that you can either boot into windows,
[00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:59.040]   specifically, have it take over the screen,
[00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:02.560]   use all the drivers, or you can just
[00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:06.760]   use that one app that you need to use by double clicking it,
[00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:08.720]   and it'll open.
[00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:10.920]   Right next to all your other Mac OS stuff.
[00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:14.760]   So you're still in-- so you launched an OS X.
[00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:17.880]   And you're sitting in OS X. And when you open parallels,
[00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:21.200]   you're still really using the boot drive.
[00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:23.160]   You're using the bootcamp boot drive.
[00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:25.680]   So instead of a virtual disk.
[00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:27.120]   So you can have it both ways.
[00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:29.120]   Now, will that affect the performance?
[00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:29.640]   Yeah, it will.
[00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:34.680]   Because in parallels, you're not getting a full on fast windows
[00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:35.600]   machine.
[00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:40.800]   And you still don't have drivers for the video card.
[00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:42.920]   So if you're playing games like Half Life 2,
[00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:45.960]   you definitely want to use bootcamp to go into that.
[00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:52.040]   But if you have a need to run, for example, IE7,
[00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:56.000]   that's internet exploit or 7, then you
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.240]   can run it next to your Mac.
[00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:01.280]   So if I want to use a high end thing,
[00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:02.800]   I still need to reboot.
[00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:05.200]   So if I want to use something like a really high end game
[00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:08.840]   or a high end graphics, I still can't use it through a window.
[00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:13.640]   They've also improved the graphics drivers within parallels
[00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:14.600]   as well.
[00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:22.320]   So if you're wanting to run XSI, that's a mouthful,
[00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:25.240]   then it's actually very doable in parallels now.
[00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:25.680]   Really?
[00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:26.040]   Yeah.
[00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:26.920]   I'll have to try it.
[00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:28.640]   One thing that a lot of people are excited about,
[00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:31.680]   Matt Howie had a good post about one new feature of a called
[00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:35.280]   Coherence, which now allows you to actually run kind
[00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:38.360]   of a separate Windows window, almost along the lines
[00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:40.120]   of having classic running, where you've
[00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:41.440]   got it kind of running in the background.
[00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:43.800]   But then you can have a window open,
[00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:46.840]   and it'll be just that window into, say, IE or what have you.
[00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:48.640]   So if you're a web developer and you're somebody who
[00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:50.840]   wants to test out or you're an interaction designer
[00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:53.720]   or you're doing CSS and you want to need to compare on platforms,
[00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:55.840]   I mean, you just took a big leap forward in terms
[00:06:55.840 --> 00:06:57.200]   of making it easy to use.
[00:06:57.200 --> 00:06:59.960]   And Coherence is something completely separate from parallels?
[00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:00.880]   It's part of parallel.
[00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:01.520]   It's part of parallel.
[00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:06.560]   So let's you pull a window out of the Windows window.
[00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:10.280]   So it's pretty remarkable to see, because you're used to seeing
[00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:14.360]   Windows running that kind of full Windows take over everything
[00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:14.680]   mode.
[00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:15.720]   And here it is just running.
[00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:17.760]   It looks just like another window out there.
[00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:19.720]   Well, if you were running virtue desktop,
[00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:21.200]   you could have Windows running in there,
[00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:22.760]   and so you could switch back and forth.
[00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:25.680]   It was pretty cool to do that.
[00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:28.000]   That way you could switch to Windows and switch back to Mac,
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:29.560]   and it did its thing.
[00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:32.400]   But with Coherence, you can basically
[00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:37.440]   have that window right alongside your other Mac things,
[00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:40.520]   which means it makes it less like running Windows,
[00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:41.560]   and more like running a Mac.
[00:07:41.560 --> 00:07:42.800]   And we know how much--
[00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:44.800]   this really is big news for Scott.
[00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:45.440]   Because I know Scott--
[00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:47.080]   Scott's finally-- you're probably pretty excited about this,
[00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:47.280]   right?
[00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:48.600]   Yeah, this is big news for Scott.
[00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:51.160]   I figured out how to run Windows in parallel.
[00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:54.000]   It's called buying a $400 Dell and sitting it next to my Mac.
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:08:01.520]   I have to admit, it is funny that I've used Windows more
[00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:06.840]   now since the Intel Mac than I did ever before.
[00:08:06.840 --> 00:08:09.120]   Because I have it open probably once a day.
[00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:11.480]   Because I need to open some app or I need to do something
[00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:13.280]   that-- and I'm much more open to it now.
[00:08:13.280 --> 00:08:15.000]   This is a pretty tasty development.
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:16.840]   I haven't used it myself because I
[00:08:16.840 --> 00:08:19.280]   have two makes of disk space left.
[00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:23.040]   But if you're somebody who has to run Windows stuff
[00:08:23.040 --> 00:08:24.800]   to keep the lights on, this looks
[00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:27.520]   like a really terrific way to do that without having to--
[00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:29.800]   Hey, Alex, I just want to warn you about this.
[00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:32.760]   If you continue to do this, you are going to go blind.
[00:08:32.760 --> 00:08:33.360]   Do what?
[00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:34.840]   Use Windows.
[00:08:34.840 --> 00:08:36.400]   Use Windows.
[00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:38.240]   Well, it's not just Windows that does this.
[00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:41.880]   I mean, you can use other operating systems in this.
[00:08:41.880 --> 00:08:42.640]   Right.
[00:08:42.640 --> 00:08:43.920]   You can run Solaris.
[00:08:43.920 --> 00:08:44.920]   You could run Linux.
[00:08:44.920 --> 00:08:47.920]   You could run Ubuntu, all those different things.
[00:08:47.920 --> 00:08:49.800]   You could even actually run DOS.
[00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:52.000]   Let's get into the whole conversation of really how
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.800]   we interact with an OS is starting to become really different.
[00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:56.200]   When we have this--
[00:08:56.200 --> 00:08:57.280]   when we just have simply--
[00:08:57.280 --> 00:08:59.320]   it looks like what's really happening here
[00:08:59.320 --> 00:09:01.440]   is we're moving to a point where we just don't--
[00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:04.960]   at least on the Apple hardware, we don't really care
[00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:06.120]   what operating system we're--
[00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:08.640]   I mean, Scott cares.
[00:09:08.640 --> 00:09:11.040]   But for the most part, all of us,
[00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:12.960]   we could be running anything we want,
[00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:14.960]   sitting on that platform in just Windows.
[00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:18.360]   And that gives you an excuse to have a couple 24-inch monitor.
[00:09:18.360 --> 00:09:21.520]   If you have four operating systems running all at the same time.
[00:09:21.520 --> 00:09:24.160]   It really is the new classic.
[00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:24.840]   The new classic.
[00:09:24.840 --> 00:09:25.340]   It is.
[00:09:25.340 --> 00:09:26.440]   It's the new classic.
[00:09:26.440 --> 00:09:29.600]   So if you wanted to run Railroad Tycoon, which
[00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:34.600]   is a really fun classic DOS game, you could actually
[00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:35.720]   have that run.
[00:09:35.720 --> 00:09:38.200]   And you wouldn't actually have to go back to the old hardware
[00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:39.920]   to do that.
[00:09:39.920 --> 00:09:41.280]   Hey, John, can I run Zork?
[00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:44.440]   Yeah, actually you can run Zork.
[00:09:44.440 --> 00:09:49.120]   But you don't actually need to run Zork on Windows,
[00:09:49.120 --> 00:09:50.840]   because they ported it.
[00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:53.440]   They took all the old info.com.
[00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:57.640]   That files, and there's actually a player that does the parser.
[00:09:57.640 --> 00:09:58.560]   Is it like name?
[00:09:58.560 --> 00:10:00.320]   It's like name, but it's four.
[00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:01.080]   What about glider?
[00:10:01.080 --> 00:10:03.160]   Could I get my hands on glider?
[00:10:03.160 --> 00:10:05.600]   What's really weird is that I've actually
[00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:08.680]   gotten into occasionally when I need a little break.
[00:10:08.680 --> 00:10:11.200]   I've gotten into booting into Windows,
[00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:14.560]   so that I can play Apple II e-games.
[00:10:14.560 --> 00:10:16.560]   Oh, on the web page?
[00:10:16.560 --> 00:10:17.840]   Yeah, there's this web page.
[00:10:17.840 --> 00:10:19.920]   There's a web page that has--
[00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:22.160]   they have basically taken all the Apple II--
[00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:25.200]   I mean, just about every Apple II e-game in existence.
[00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:25.920]   What's the name of the site?
[00:10:25.920 --> 00:10:27.280]   OK, now I can't remember.
[00:10:27.280 --> 00:10:29.200]   So I brought it up off the top of my head.
[00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:30.160]   We'll get back to it.
[00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:31.160]   It's a pretty cool thing.
[00:10:31.160 --> 00:10:35.480]   So with the new parallel, so you don't actually
[00:10:35.480 --> 00:10:37.360]   have to switch to boot camp to do that,
[00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:39.880]   you could, without doing the reboot,
[00:10:39.880 --> 00:10:44.760]   you could open up Internet Exploder, type in the URL, which
[00:10:44.760 --> 00:10:47.840]   is virtualapple.org.
[00:10:47.840 --> 00:10:48.320]   Yeah.
[00:10:48.320 --> 00:10:48.840]   There you go.
[00:10:48.840 --> 00:10:50.080]   And you can run Aztec.
[00:10:50.080 --> 00:10:50.680]   Aztec.
[00:10:50.680 --> 00:10:51.760]   And you can run--
[00:10:51.760 --> 00:10:52.960]   You can run Aztec.
[00:10:52.960 --> 00:10:53.440]   --Apple Panic.
[00:10:53.440 --> 00:10:54.120]   And Aztec.
[00:10:54.120 --> 00:10:55.560]   And you could run Galaxian.
[00:10:55.560 --> 00:10:56.120]   And Aztec.
[00:10:56.120 --> 00:10:57.760]   Well, you got that stagecoach game, too.
[00:10:57.760 --> 00:10:58.720]   Oh, right.
[00:10:58.720 --> 00:11:01.480]   And you can play Aztec.
[00:11:01.480 --> 00:11:02.160]   They got Aztec?
[00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:03.160]   They got Aztec.
[00:11:03.160 --> 00:11:07.640]   That was my-- when I gave up years of my live playing Aztec.
[00:11:07.640 --> 00:11:08.560]   That was a great game.
[00:11:08.560 --> 00:11:10.200]   So funny, I remember back in the day,
[00:11:10.200 --> 00:11:13.120]   when they very first introduced whatever the 1.4--
[00:11:13.120 --> 00:11:16.520]   was it the 1.4 meg flopies that could run, the HD flopies
[00:11:16.520 --> 00:11:18.200]   that could run on Windows?
[00:11:18.200 --> 00:11:18.920]   The HD.
[00:11:18.920 --> 00:11:19.400]   HD.
[00:11:19.400 --> 00:11:20.400]   So they were called?
[00:11:20.400 --> 00:11:20.900]   Yeah.
[00:11:20.900 --> 00:11:22.000]   Was that why I remember correctly?
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:22.840]   High density.
[00:11:22.840 --> 00:11:23.320]   Well, those were--
[00:11:23.320 --> 00:11:24.960]   I had-- I only needed four of those.
[00:11:24.960 --> 00:11:26.680]   Everything that I had.
[00:11:26.680 --> 00:11:28.240]   But it was so-- I mean, that was such--
[00:11:28.240 --> 00:11:30.600]   it seemed like such an incredible leap forward at the time.
[00:11:30.600 --> 00:11:31.880]   I don't know what this was.
[00:11:31.880 --> 00:11:33.120]   Probably what the late '80s, early '90s.
[00:11:33.120 --> 00:11:35.800]   But it was such an elite forward that you could run.
[00:11:35.800 --> 00:11:38.840]   It was so transparent for somebody on Windows
[00:11:38.840 --> 00:11:39.800]   to give you a disk.
[00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:41.240]   And you just pop it in and it would work.
[00:11:41.240 --> 00:11:42.960]   And now, today, we take that so much for granted.
[00:11:42.960 --> 00:11:45.200]   But you start to think about all those little baby steps
[00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:48.320]   back then about how you kind of had your number two
[00:11:48.320 --> 00:11:49.800]   when you got to try harder.
[00:11:49.800 --> 00:11:52.920]   And now, today, I mean, a lot you can get away with just
[00:11:52.920 --> 00:11:54.440]   having a Mac for, you know?
[00:11:54.440 --> 00:11:55.840]   Well, especially in this case.
[00:11:55.840 --> 00:11:58.080]   Now, there is something that I think
[00:11:58.080 --> 00:12:00.680]   we need to get out of the way here.
[00:12:00.680 --> 00:12:04.080]   We have to have our weekly iPhone report.
[00:12:04.080 --> 00:12:05.280]   We wish we had theme music for this.
[00:12:05.280 --> 00:12:05.780]   I know.
[00:12:05.780 --> 00:12:20.500]   [SINGING]
[00:12:20.500 --> 00:12:23.140]   Now, we're jumping to game hardware,
[00:12:23.140 --> 00:12:25.340]   and we're going to have Scott born give us the report.
[00:12:25.340 --> 00:12:28.140]   Give us the traffic board of iPhone, Scott.
[00:12:28.140 --> 00:12:30.380]   Well, here's what you need to know, friends.
[00:12:30.380 --> 00:12:36.180]   Our pal, Kevin Rose, Allah Dig Kevin Rose, who
[00:12:36.180 --> 00:12:39.620]   has a propensity to consume alcoholic beverages known
[00:12:39.620 --> 00:12:43.380]   as beer and rant, gave away some interesting secrets
[00:12:43.380 --> 00:12:46.300]   about the new iPhone that made it to YouTube.
[00:12:46.300 --> 00:12:49.220]   And it's been downloaded a bajillion times.
[00:12:49.220 --> 00:12:52.100]   And pretty much all you need to do is watch that video
[00:12:52.100 --> 00:12:54.060]   to get the latest poop.
[00:12:54.060 --> 00:12:56.580]   Well, how do you know Kevin's poop is accurate?
[00:12:56.580 --> 00:12:57.060]   He has.
[00:12:57.060 --> 00:12:59.220]   He's been known to have an actual poop.
[00:12:59.220 --> 00:13:00.820]   Oh, his poop has been known to be accurate.
[00:13:00.820 --> 00:13:03.740]   So glad you asked that, because you've
[00:13:03.740 --> 00:13:05.820]   fallen right into my trap, Mr. Mann.
[00:13:05.820 --> 00:13:08.900]   Chris is your new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new,
[00:13:08.900 --> 00:13:09.900]   Scott, boy.
[00:13:09.900 --> 00:13:14.500]   It is well known that Kevin accurately predicted the nano
[00:13:14.500 --> 00:13:16.580]   before anybody else.
[00:13:16.580 --> 00:13:17.700]   So there you have it.
[00:13:17.700 --> 00:13:21.180]   If you look at the patent that was posted everywhere,
[00:13:21.180 --> 00:13:24.300]   it's very different, that patent.
[00:13:24.300 --> 00:13:25.780]   It doesn't talk about two batteries.
[00:13:25.780 --> 00:13:28.660]   It doesn't talk about touch screen.
[00:13:28.660 --> 00:13:32.620]   It talks about ceramic case and fake diamonds and all that.
[00:13:32.620 --> 00:13:37.900]   Well, the Zarconia case seems much more exciting to me
[00:13:37.900 --> 00:13:39.300]   for some reason.
[00:13:39.300 --> 00:13:41.020]   Something that won't scratch.
[00:13:41.020 --> 00:13:41.380]   Yeah.
[00:13:41.380 --> 00:13:42.140]   Here's what we know.
[00:13:42.140 --> 00:13:44.780]   It's not going to be available in brown.
[00:13:44.780 --> 00:13:48.220]   No, it'll be available in clear.
[00:13:48.220 --> 00:13:50.460]   No, I think it's-- I think it's Zarconia case
[00:13:50.460 --> 00:13:51.980]   that was totally clear where you could
[00:13:51.980 --> 00:13:53.380]   see all the little innards going on.
[00:13:53.380 --> 00:13:54.860]   I'd get that.
[00:13:54.860 --> 00:13:56.180]   Yeah, I think that would be a little bit easier.
[00:13:56.180 --> 00:13:56.700]   That's our room.
[00:13:56.700 --> 00:13:57.380]   That's my rumor.
[00:13:57.380 --> 00:13:59.500]   And I haven't even been drinking anything.
[00:13:59.500 --> 00:14:01.340]   Here's my pledge to you, my friend.
[00:14:01.340 --> 00:14:05.540]   If the iPhone is somehow, some way, by some miracle,
[00:14:05.540 --> 00:14:09.100]   and no one expects it to be, but if it is, shipping it
[00:14:09.100 --> 00:14:13.940]   Macworld, when we sit down at the Apple Store
[00:14:13.940 --> 00:14:17.100]   to do Macbreak Weekly, I will hand you your very own.
[00:14:17.100 --> 00:14:19.620]   Oh, thanks.
[00:14:19.620 --> 00:14:20.660]   Scott, you're the best.
[00:14:20.660 --> 00:14:22.020]   Because I've been waiting.
[00:14:22.020 --> 00:14:24.620]   I've been waiting for this iPhone for like a year and a half
[00:14:24.620 --> 00:14:25.420]   now.
[00:14:25.420 --> 00:14:26.940]   My trio is like barely working.
[00:14:26.940 --> 00:14:32.780]   Your pain, my trio just makes fun of me whenever I try to sink it.
[00:14:32.780 --> 00:14:35.260]   Yeah, no, I don't even bother anymore.
[00:14:35.260 --> 00:14:37.900]   My trio lives in one world, and my Mac lives in another.
[00:14:37.900 --> 00:14:39.820]   Now, Merlin will tell me his trio and his Mac
[00:14:39.820 --> 00:14:41.260]   are getting along in the same world.
[00:14:41.260 --> 00:14:42.500]   I've stopped saying that because I
[00:14:42.500 --> 00:14:45.860]   know that I am in some kind of mythological way,
[00:14:45.860 --> 00:14:48.620]   like testing some kind of fate by constantly saying that.
[00:14:48.620 --> 00:14:49.700]   So I've stopped saying that.
[00:14:49.700 --> 00:14:51.980]   It's really-- yeah, but he's literally not just
[00:14:51.980 --> 00:14:53.220]   because he's named Merlin.
[00:14:53.220 --> 00:14:55.660]   He's literally a wizard at all this organizational stuff.
[00:14:55.660 --> 00:14:57.300]   So it makes sense it'll work for him,
[00:14:57.300 --> 00:14:59.100]   but normal people can't make it work.
[00:14:59.100 --> 00:15:00.820]   No, it's really easy to sink a trio.
[00:15:00.820 --> 00:15:03.140]   All you have to do is drop it in a glass of water.
[00:15:03.140 --> 00:15:05.140]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:15:05.140 --> 00:15:10.860]   Wet all the way to the bottom.
[00:15:10.860 --> 00:15:13.340]   OK, OK.
[00:15:13.340 --> 00:15:16.700]   And so that wraps up this section of iPhone.
[00:15:16.700 --> 00:15:18.940]   And now we're going to get back from right now.
[00:15:18.940 --> 00:15:20.980]   OK, by the way, I do want to mention
[00:15:20.980 --> 00:15:24.180]   that there is a new Twitch podcast coming called
[00:15:24.180 --> 00:15:27.060]   "Twee This Week in iPhone."
[00:15:27.060 --> 00:15:28.900]   Hosted by Scott Born.
[00:15:28.900 --> 00:15:32.740]   Yeah, it'll be all the iPhone rumors you can possibly stand.
[00:15:32.740 --> 00:15:35.260]   So now we had a couple postings.
[00:15:35.260 --> 00:15:37.220]   Well, actually, a lot of postings about Mac Heist.
[00:15:37.220 --> 00:15:39.380]   And I still have no idea what they do.
[00:15:39.380 --> 00:15:43.140]   Mac Heist is-- it's a treasure hunt.
[00:15:43.140 --> 00:15:44.940]   You have to go around a bunch of fake websites,
[00:15:44.940 --> 00:15:49.300]   find bits of information, which actually then
[00:15:49.300 --> 00:15:53.100]   spells things like passwords or URLs or that kind of stuff.
[00:15:53.100 --> 00:15:54.700]   They're into week three.
[00:15:54.700 --> 00:15:56.380]   I skipped week two.
[00:15:56.380 --> 00:15:59.580]   It seemed to be a bit geeky for me.
[00:15:59.580 --> 00:16:00.100]   Really?
[00:16:00.100 --> 00:16:01.580]   Well, yeah.
[00:16:01.580 --> 00:16:03.860]   Well, no, I mean, it started off with Morse code.
[00:16:03.860 --> 00:16:05.780]   And I'm like, OK, I'm listening to that going.
[00:16:05.780 --> 00:16:06.700]   And it spells that.
[00:16:06.700 --> 00:16:10.820]   OK, so that's right off that I can hear Morse code and translate it.
[00:16:10.820 --> 00:16:14.980]   And it was too geeky for you to say.
[00:16:14.980 --> 00:16:16.940]   It was too geeky for me.
[00:16:16.940 --> 00:16:17.420]   But Mac--
[00:16:17.420 --> 00:16:19.580]   I'm so tired of the semaphore.
[00:16:19.580 --> 00:16:22.100]   But Mac Heist is still pretty--
[00:16:22.100 --> 00:16:24.540]   it still looks fun.
[00:16:24.540 --> 00:16:26.220]   It's not too late to get in.
[00:16:26.220 --> 00:16:27.700]   You just need an invitation.
[00:16:27.700 --> 00:16:28.740]   So if anybody wants one--
[00:16:28.740 --> 00:16:30.140]   Is it that everybody who's already
[00:16:30.140 --> 00:16:31.980]   member gets a certain number of invites to give out?
[00:16:31.980 --> 00:16:35.380]   Yeah, so I still have some invites to give out.
[00:16:35.380 --> 00:16:36.020]   So if you want to--
[00:16:36.020 --> 00:16:36.740]   No, I've got them.
[00:16:36.740 --> 00:16:38.340]   I just haven't done it.
[00:16:38.340 --> 00:16:39.340]   You haven't participated.
[00:16:39.340 --> 00:16:40.380]   I'm not-- I don't play games.
[00:16:40.380 --> 00:16:41.580]   You're not really into games?
[00:16:41.580 --> 00:16:44.260]   I'm really-- I'm really not.
[00:16:44.260 --> 00:16:47.540]   Kind of interesting because Sketch Fighter just came out
[00:16:47.540 --> 00:16:49.380]   from Ambrosia.
[00:16:49.380 --> 00:16:54.100]   It's a new fighter game that's based on somebody doodling
[00:16:54.100 --> 00:16:56.340]   on a piece of paper in class.
[00:16:56.340 --> 00:16:57.340]   Really?
[00:16:57.340 --> 00:16:59.620]   And so it's a top-down view with paper.
[00:16:59.620 --> 00:17:01.420]   And it looks all sketchy.
[00:17:01.420 --> 00:17:03.500]   And I don't know.
[00:17:03.500 --> 00:17:05.660]   It's kind of like asteroids and defender.
[00:17:05.660 --> 00:17:09.180]   And I don't know.
[00:17:09.180 --> 00:17:09.860]   That sounds pretty cool.
[00:17:09.860 --> 00:17:10.700]   Yeah, it is pretty cool.
[00:17:10.700 --> 00:17:12.580]   They used to have a great pinball game.
[00:17:12.580 --> 00:17:12.980]   Pinball game.
[00:17:12.980 --> 00:17:15.740]   I want to say Crystal Castle or something like that.
[00:17:15.740 --> 00:17:16.700]   Crystal--
[00:17:16.700 --> 00:17:19.420]   They had this great-- and it actually had like bumping.
[00:17:19.420 --> 00:17:19.940]   Yeah.
[00:17:19.940 --> 00:17:20.980]   Oh, yeah, it could move it around.
[00:17:20.980 --> 00:17:22.380]   Ambrosia has some great games.
[00:17:22.380 --> 00:17:24.140]   And then before that, and then after that,
[00:17:24.140 --> 00:17:28.260]   they had a maelstrom, which is an asteroid game.
[00:17:28.260 --> 00:17:30.780]   Oh, I find that Ambrosia is probably
[00:17:30.780 --> 00:17:32.260]   one of the more schizophrenic companies
[00:17:32.260 --> 00:17:33.980]   I've ever seen as far as software development.
[00:17:33.980 --> 00:17:36.900]   I think it's just-- it's whatever Andrew Welch just
[00:17:36.900 --> 00:17:38.860]   feels like writing today.
[00:17:38.860 --> 00:17:40.220]   Because it ranges.
[00:17:40.220 --> 00:17:42.980]   You have wiretap, which is--
[00:17:42.980 --> 00:17:45.220]   records audio on your Mac.
[00:17:45.220 --> 00:17:46.500]   That's them, too.
[00:17:46.500 --> 00:17:48.940]   wiretap pro snaps.
[00:17:48.940 --> 00:17:50.540]   Video queue them as well?
[00:17:50.540 --> 00:17:51.060]   No.
[00:17:51.060 --> 00:17:51.260]   No.
[00:17:51.260 --> 00:17:52.700]   wiretap just does audio.
[00:17:52.700 --> 00:17:56.260]   But it'll let you wire in any of the audio inputs
[00:17:56.260 --> 00:17:57.900]   so you can record both.
[00:17:57.900 --> 00:18:01.620]   And then snaps lets you record those screen grabs.
[00:18:01.620 --> 00:18:05.860]   And then you have snaps, and then you have--
[00:18:05.860 --> 00:18:08.140]   but then you go to this, then you have all these games.
[00:18:08.140 --> 00:18:09.180]   And then you--
[00:18:09.180 --> 00:18:11.100]   It's very schizophrenic.
[00:18:11.100 --> 00:18:13.300]   They've been around forever, though, haven't they?
[00:18:13.300 --> 00:18:13.860]   They have.
[00:18:13.860 --> 00:18:15.420]   They have.
[00:18:15.420 --> 00:18:16.100]   Anything else?
[00:18:16.100 --> 00:18:20.020]   Hey, Scott, what do you know about cheating on your games
[00:18:20.020 --> 00:18:22.460]   on your iPod?
[00:18:22.460 --> 00:18:25.220]   Well, a couple of the news and rumor sites
[00:18:25.220 --> 00:18:27.380]   have posted a link, which I don't have handy.
[00:18:27.380 --> 00:18:28.700]   But I'm sure it's easy to Google.
[00:18:28.700 --> 00:18:29.180]   Oh, sorry.
[00:18:29.180 --> 00:18:31.940]   I wasn't supposed to say that as a verb.
[00:18:31.940 --> 00:18:34.820]   They have offered some cheat codes
[00:18:34.820 --> 00:18:37.940]   for some of the real popular iPod games.
[00:18:37.940 --> 00:18:41.180]   And I've been trying to win Texas Hold 'em, which
[00:18:41.180 --> 00:18:44.020]   I got addicted to thanks to my pal Derek's story.
[00:18:44.020 --> 00:18:45.420]   And I'm getting my butt kicked.
[00:18:45.420 --> 00:18:49.060]   So I just greedily went and downloaded these cheat codes
[00:18:49.060 --> 00:18:49.940]   for Texas Hold 'em.
[00:18:49.940 --> 00:18:53.340]   And there are all kinds of Easter eggs and cool things
[00:18:53.340 --> 00:18:56.100]   you can do with the game that you didn't know about.
[00:18:56.100 --> 00:19:01.660]   So these $4.95 games have just had some new extensibility
[00:19:01.660 --> 00:19:04.420]   given to them by the release of these cheat codes, which
[00:19:04.420 --> 00:19:06.740]   I understand and came right from Apple.
[00:19:06.740 --> 00:19:08.180]   Oh.
[00:19:08.180 --> 00:19:10.980]   I still need to get some of those games on my iPod.
[00:19:10.980 --> 00:19:13.220]   I'm going to tell you, Alex, they are brilliant.
[00:19:13.220 --> 00:19:16.740]   I think that personally, Apple's missing the boat
[00:19:16.740 --> 00:19:19.300]   if they don't continue to develop this kind of stuff.
[00:19:19.300 --> 00:19:20.100]   It's a horrible thing.
[00:19:20.100 --> 00:19:20.780]   Or allow other people to.
[00:19:20.780 --> 00:19:22.380]   I mean, that wasn't the big upset.
[00:19:22.380 --> 00:19:24.220]   Is there a lot of people wanted to develop games.
[00:19:24.220 --> 00:19:26.420]   A lot of people wanted to develop games for the iPod.
[00:19:26.420 --> 00:19:28.620]   And Apple didn't give them any way to do that.
[00:19:28.620 --> 00:19:30.100]   And then Apple started releasing their own.
[00:19:30.100 --> 00:19:32.140]   And I think that's what a lot of developers
[00:19:32.140 --> 00:19:32.980]   were a little upset about.
[00:19:32.980 --> 00:19:36.140]   And then the developers really want to develop for the iPod.
[00:19:36.140 --> 00:19:39.060]   I mean, the iPod is an amazing platform.
[00:19:39.060 --> 00:19:41.340]   And you see them everywhere.
[00:19:41.340 --> 00:19:44.340]   There's 50 million of them have been sold.
[00:19:44.340 --> 00:19:48.020]   And it would seem to me that I would love
[00:19:48.020 --> 00:19:50.940]   to have my own app on there.
[00:19:50.940 --> 00:19:52.820]   Well, I think that everybody that's
[00:19:52.820 --> 00:19:55.500]   tired of paying $70 for an Xbox game
[00:19:55.500 --> 00:19:57.900]   that the kids get tired of in 15 minutes
[00:19:57.900 --> 00:20:01.020]   will be pretty thrilled to know these games are under $5.
[00:20:01.020 --> 00:20:04.460]   And I've been playing Texas Hold them almost every day
[00:20:04.460 --> 00:20:05.300]   for two months.
[00:20:05.300 --> 00:20:07.140]   So I think they're really cool.
[00:20:07.140 --> 00:20:08.540]   When they know the first steps of the minute
[00:20:08.540 --> 00:20:09.260]   you have a problem.
[00:20:09.260 --> 00:20:13.060]   When they talk about potentially the next generation of iPod
[00:20:13.060 --> 00:20:15.340]   catching up with the Zoom in terms of the wireless stuff,
[00:20:15.340 --> 00:20:17.460]   are they talking about Bluetooth probably
[00:20:17.460 --> 00:20:19.980]   as the likely networking or the likely wireless for that?
[00:20:19.980 --> 00:20:21.620]   It seems like Bluetooth would make the most sense.
[00:20:21.620 --> 00:20:23.180]   Because it would be really interesting.
[00:20:23.180 --> 00:20:24.540]   I'm totally pulling this out of my butt.
[00:20:24.540 --> 00:20:26.940]   But it would be pretty cool if you could have a very
[00:20:26.940 --> 00:20:31.740]   little small kind of portable Bluetooth joystick controller.
[00:20:31.740 --> 00:20:34.140]   Because God knows, there's enough firepower going on
[00:20:34.140 --> 00:20:35.500]   on your iPod that you could probably
[00:20:35.500 --> 00:20:36.700]   have some pretty cool games.
[00:20:36.700 --> 00:20:38.100]   And have an external controller for that
[00:20:38.100 --> 00:20:39.340]   would be totally badass.
[00:20:39.340 --> 00:20:44.660]   The patents that nobody read, everyone got to the diamond
[00:20:44.660 --> 00:20:46.540]   part and they stopped reading.
[00:20:46.540 --> 00:20:53.260]   Actually talks about Bluetooth, 802.11, and other wireless
[00:20:53.260 --> 00:20:55.380]   transmitters inside this case.
[00:20:55.380 --> 00:20:56.180]   What?
[00:20:56.180 --> 00:20:56.700]   Yeah.
[00:20:56.700 --> 00:20:59.300]   In a portable battery powered device,
[00:20:59.300 --> 00:21:02.500]   does that sink in like a lot of load in terms of battery?
[00:21:02.500 --> 00:21:05.620]   Well, a cell phone actually uses way more power
[00:21:05.620 --> 00:21:09.620]   requirements for its transmitter than 802.11 does.
[00:21:09.620 --> 00:21:14.380]   Because it's shorter range, it can only be 35 milliwatts
[00:21:14.380 --> 00:21:15.740]   total power.
[00:21:15.740 --> 00:21:18.540]   And Bluetooth is even less.
[00:21:18.540 --> 00:21:22.340]   So sure, there'd be three transmitters in it.
[00:21:22.340 --> 00:21:26.420]   But you can be really creative in how you power them.
[00:21:26.420 --> 00:21:28.580]   If you don't need to power them, then power it down.
[00:21:28.580 --> 00:21:29.940]   If you don't need to get something.
[00:21:29.940 --> 00:21:32.740]   It's just like the old power manager on the power books
[00:21:32.740 --> 00:21:34.180]   back in the day.
[00:21:34.180 --> 00:21:35.420]   That was very innovative.
[00:21:35.420 --> 00:21:37.420]   And Apple was really the first company
[00:21:37.420 --> 00:21:39.900]   to have major power management, where
[00:21:39.900 --> 00:21:45.180]   they were able to shut down displays, drive, CD-ROMs,
[00:21:45.180 --> 00:21:48.020]   modems, all that kind of stuff as it
[00:21:48.020 --> 00:21:50.620]   wasn't needed to save battery power.
[00:21:50.620 --> 00:21:51.100]   Totally.
[00:21:51.100 --> 00:21:52.500]   Slightly off topic here.
[00:21:52.500 --> 00:21:55.540]   I've recently had to travel a little bit more.
[00:21:55.540 --> 00:21:57.260]   And I'll tell you, it sure does make a difference
[00:21:57.260 --> 00:22:00.020]   to shut off the airport and shut off the Bluetooth
[00:22:00.020 --> 00:22:02.500]   and then bring the screen down if you don't need it.
[00:22:02.500 --> 00:22:04.500]   You as far as--
[00:22:04.500 --> 00:22:08.500]   I used to always leave my wireless on.
[00:22:08.500 --> 00:22:10.260]   And Bluetooth never even occurred to me.
[00:22:10.260 --> 00:22:11.900]   And then I read somewhere that said,
[00:22:11.900 --> 00:22:14.140]   obviously, take your screen down to the very lowest notch
[00:22:14.140 --> 00:22:15.300]   that you can handle.
[00:22:15.300 --> 00:22:17.620]   You'll really see this on the 17-inch,
[00:22:17.620 --> 00:22:19.060]   because that's the hugest power draw.
[00:22:19.060 --> 00:22:21.580]   But shutting off your airport, if you're on a plane,
[00:22:21.580 --> 00:22:23.140]   and shutting off your Bluetooth, it actually
[00:22:23.140 --> 00:22:24.220]   does make a difference.
[00:22:24.220 --> 00:22:25.340]   It's interesting, because they always
[00:22:25.340 --> 00:22:27.500]   talk about turning your damn cell phone off on an airplane.
[00:22:27.500 --> 00:22:30.540]   But they never say turn off your 8/11 ABG.
[00:22:30.540 --> 00:22:32.220]   Well, actually, one of the things
[00:22:32.220 --> 00:22:33.980]   that's interesting about turning off your cell phone
[00:22:33.980 --> 00:22:36.380]   is that I was talking to an engineer.
[00:22:36.380 --> 00:22:38.180]   I spend a lot of time on planes.
[00:22:38.180 --> 00:22:40.340]   And I ended up one time sitting down
[00:22:40.340 --> 00:22:43.700]   an engineer that works on-- that does both work with the airlines,
[00:22:43.700 --> 00:22:45.860]   but also works on cell phones, design.
[00:22:45.860 --> 00:22:47.100]   And one of the things that he said,
[00:22:47.100 --> 00:22:52.340]   he goes, if you have any health concerns about a cell phone,
[00:22:52.340 --> 00:22:54.900]   you should always turn it off when you're on the plane.
[00:22:54.900 --> 00:22:56.500]   Because what happens is, is a cell phone,
[00:22:56.500 --> 00:23:00.740]   when it can't reach a signal, it goes full blast
[00:23:00.740 --> 00:23:01.820]   trying to find the signal.
[00:23:01.820 --> 00:23:03.420]   And it's constantly trying to find the signal.
[00:23:03.420 --> 00:23:05.180]   And that's why, if you've ever noticed,
[00:23:05.180 --> 00:23:06.700]   you have a phone, you leave it on.
[00:23:06.700 --> 00:23:09.140]   And in a five-hour flight, it'll be dead when you land.
[00:23:09.140 --> 00:23:12.180]   That's because it was running full tilt the entire time.
[00:23:12.180 --> 00:23:13.540]   He said, bro, four radians.
[00:23:13.540 --> 00:23:14.740]   Like when you're roaming, your power
[00:23:14.740 --> 00:23:16.140]   goes plummets.
[00:23:16.140 --> 00:23:16.500]   Right.
[00:23:16.500 --> 00:23:17.740]   Because it's always looking for something.
[00:23:17.740 --> 00:23:20.500]   Well, he said, basically, it looks for four hours straight
[00:23:20.500 --> 00:23:21.500]   when you're on a flight.
[00:23:21.500 --> 00:23:24.660]   And he said, and whether you can argue about whether you
[00:23:24.660 --> 00:23:26.260]   should put it up by your head or not.
[00:23:26.260 --> 00:23:29.100]   But he said, it looking for four hours straight within four
[00:23:29.100 --> 00:23:30.620]   feet of your head is not a good idea.
[00:23:30.620 --> 00:23:31.980]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:23:31.980 --> 00:23:33.900]   Because that's the biggest reason to turn off your phone.
[00:23:33.900 --> 00:23:35.420]   It doesn't matter what they think.
[00:23:35.420 --> 00:23:37.220]   He said it's not going to affect any of the instruments
[00:23:37.220 --> 00:23:38.060]   on the plane.
[00:23:38.060 --> 00:23:41.460]   But it may affect the instruments in your head.
[00:23:41.460 --> 00:23:42.900]   Speaking of power, I just thought
[00:23:42.900 --> 00:23:45.860]   I'd also mention something that happened with my new laptop.
[00:23:45.860 --> 00:23:49.460]   I got four hours and 28 minutes off my first cycle.
[00:23:49.460 --> 00:23:52.020]   You are kidding on a 17-inch?
[00:23:52.020 --> 00:23:53.180]   On the 17-inch.
[00:23:53.180 --> 00:23:55.100]   The battery is, by the way, quite a bit bigger
[00:23:55.100 --> 00:23:56.140]   than on the 15-inch.
[00:23:56.140 --> 00:23:57.180]   That could be the reason.
[00:23:57.180 --> 00:24:00.900]   But I usually got three hours and 10 minutes on my 15-inch.
[00:24:00.900 --> 00:24:03.540]   And this one, I got four hours and 28 minutes
[00:24:03.540 --> 00:24:06.020]   and four hours and 18 minutes in the first two cycles.
[00:24:06.020 --> 00:24:07.460]   That's incredible.
[00:24:07.460 --> 00:24:08.820]   I don't get anything like that.
[00:24:08.820 --> 00:24:11.100]   I get on my 15-inch MacBook Pro.
[00:24:11.100 --> 00:24:14.500]   I get-- like, right now, I've got lots of stuff turned down.
[00:24:14.500 --> 00:24:15.660]   And it's got two and 1/2 hours.
[00:24:15.660 --> 00:24:17.820]   It says, if I'm not doing much, I can get three hours.
[00:24:17.820 --> 00:24:20.100]   But that's with a tailwind.
[00:24:20.100 --> 00:24:20.100]   Yeah.
[00:24:20.100 --> 00:24:22.220]   You recycle your battery, Merlin?
[00:24:22.220 --> 00:24:23.660]   I try to do it every 30 days.
[00:24:23.660 --> 00:24:25.260]   But people still say that's voodoo.
[00:24:25.260 --> 00:24:28.140]   But I like to do it every 30 to 45 days.
[00:24:28.140 --> 00:24:30.020]   Mind cycles, as I said at the beginning of the show,
[00:24:30.020 --> 00:24:32.020]   mind cycles every day.
[00:24:32.020 --> 00:24:34.260]   You burn-- well, but then-- but to truly cycle it,
[00:24:34.260 --> 00:24:37.060]   then you have to leave it dead for four hours.
[00:24:37.060 --> 00:24:37.560]   Right?
[00:24:37.560 --> 00:24:39.260]   Isn't there some rubber chicken thing you got to do?
[00:24:39.260 --> 00:24:39.860]   Yeah, some rubber chicken.
[00:24:39.860 --> 00:24:41.060]   You leave it off for four hours.
[00:24:41.060 --> 00:24:42.020]   Do you have to swing the rubber chicken?
[00:24:42.020 --> 00:24:43.020]   You have to swing the rubber chicken.
[00:24:43.020 --> 00:24:46.220]   So you've got to run it all the way down to like 0, 0, 0.
[00:24:46.220 --> 00:24:48.740]   Then you got to leave it all the way off for four hours.
[00:24:48.740 --> 00:24:49.580]   At least.
[00:24:49.580 --> 00:24:50.140]   Exactly.
[00:24:50.140 --> 00:24:51.300]   If you like to fully drain it--
[00:24:51.300 --> 00:24:51.940]   The rubber chicken.
[00:24:51.940 --> 00:24:52.420]   Rubber chicken.
[00:24:52.420 --> 00:24:53.420]   Wait the rubber chicken.
[00:24:53.420 --> 00:24:55.020]   Get some coffee.
[00:24:55.020 --> 00:24:57.340]   Watch the rest salt over your shoulder.
[00:24:57.340 --> 00:24:59.460]   And then you charge it overnight.
[00:24:59.460 --> 00:25:01.380]   You leave it like 12 hours or something plugged in.
[00:25:01.380 --> 00:25:02.220]   Yeah, before you leave it--
[00:25:02.220 --> 00:25:04.580]   John, do you believe that that helps?
[00:25:04.580 --> 00:25:06.660]   Well, it depends on the battery type.
[00:25:06.660 --> 00:25:10.220]   I know that these new battery-- the new battery technology
[00:25:10.220 --> 00:25:11.260]   shouldn't need this.
[00:25:11.260 --> 00:25:13.780]   But I've heard conflicting things.
[00:25:13.780 --> 00:25:16.820]   I've heard from the geniuses that you should cycle your batteries.
[00:25:16.820 --> 00:25:18.940]   Would you mind using air quotes when you use that word?
[00:25:18.940 --> 00:25:19.660]   Air quotes?
[00:25:19.660 --> 00:25:20.180]   OK.
[00:25:20.180 --> 00:25:20.700]   Genius.
[00:25:20.700 --> 00:25:21.700]   There we go.
[00:25:21.700 --> 00:25:24.700]   I've heard from the geniuses that you have to do this.
[00:25:24.700 --> 00:25:29.180]   Because one of the people that I know complained about their battery,
[00:25:29.180 --> 00:25:31.820]   and so the genius said, well, this is what you need to do when
[00:25:31.820 --> 00:25:33.780]   you first get a battery.
[00:25:33.780 --> 00:25:35.700]   And I was thinking, what are you supposed to do when you first
[00:25:35.700 --> 00:25:36.300]   get a battery?
[00:25:36.300 --> 00:25:39.780]   Basically charge it up, drain it to 0.
[00:25:39.780 --> 00:25:42.540]   The rubber chicken, the coffee, go get donuts,
[00:25:42.540 --> 00:25:45.380]   re-plug it in, wait, wait, wait.
[00:25:45.380 --> 00:25:48.420]   And then you can use it like normal.
[00:25:48.420 --> 00:25:49.820]   And then you'll get the maximum.
[00:25:49.820 --> 00:25:52.180]   But that seemed to me that if that was the case,
[00:25:52.180 --> 00:25:54.980]   they would do this at the factory to condition the battery
[00:25:54.980 --> 00:25:55.860]   before it went out.
[00:25:55.860 --> 00:25:58.740]   Otherwise, it would get a whole bunch of defective batteries back.
[00:25:58.740 --> 00:26:02.020]   People complaining, hey, this battery only gets an hour.
[00:26:02.020 --> 00:26:05.740]   So part of the manufacturing process must do that.
[00:26:05.740 --> 00:26:07.380]   I mean, I wouldn't let--
[00:26:07.380 --> 00:26:10.540]   if that really was the voodoo and it was supposed to do that,
[00:26:10.540 --> 00:26:11.820]   you'd see it in the instructions.
[00:26:11.820 --> 00:26:14.020]   You'd see it as the very first thing you had to do with your power book.
[00:26:14.020 --> 00:26:19.380]   I do have to admit, I'm pretty superstitious about when I first--
[00:26:19.380 --> 00:26:25.020]   when I buy anything new with a battery, like a cell phone or an iPod.
[00:26:25.020 --> 00:26:28.580]   I leave it plugged in all night.
[00:26:28.580 --> 00:26:30.980]   And I have no idea whether it makes any difference or not.
[00:26:30.980 --> 00:26:33.140]   On the same way, I've got a new remote control today.
[00:26:33.140 --> 00:26:36.660]   One of those Logitech, make coffee for your remote controls.
[00:26:36.660 --> 00:26:37.900]   With the screen.
[00:26:37.900 --> 00:26:38.660]   We have with the screen.
[00:26:38.660 --> 00:26:39.580]   The $300 one?
[00:26:39.580 --> 00:26:40.660]   It was not $300.
[00:26:40.660 --> 00:26:41.660]   Was it $200?
[00:26:41.660 --> 00:26:42.900]   You know, I'm not going to get into this.
[00:26:42.900 --> 00:26:43.900]   How much was it?
[00:26:43.900 --> 00:26:45.060]   It was not very expensive.
[00:26:45.060 --> 00:26:45.580]   You can--
[00:26:45.580 --> 00:26:47.100]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:26:47.100 --> 00:26:49.340]   How much did you spend on a remote control?
[00:26:49.340 --> 00:26:50.340]   Come on, Merlin.
[00:26:50.340 --> 00:26:51.780]   Oh, the third in Merlin, too.
[00:26:51.780 --> 00:26:52.300]   It looks like.
[00:26:52.300 --> 00:26:54.300]   OK, it was $780.
[00:26:54.300 --> 00:26:54.940]   OK.
[00:26:54.940 --> 00:26:56.500]   No, it wasn't.
[00:26:56.500 --> 00:26:57.420]   See, now I got you.
[00:26:57.420 --> 00:26:57.940]   I got you.
[00:26:57.940 --> 00:26:59.820]   Why don't you just buy a used power book and use the--
[00:26:59.820 --> 00:27:01.260]   You know, why don't you cut me a break, John?
[00:27:01.260 --> 00:27:03.260]   OK.
[00:27:03.260 --> 00:27:06.300]   You can hack a remote control out of--
[00:27:06.300 --> 00:27:13.100]   by using the sound port and a $2.50 IR diode from Radio Shack.
[00:27:13.100 --> 00:27:15.540]   OK, Phil Tyrone.
[00:27:15.540 --> 00:27:17.660]   All you need is a Leatherman and some bottle caps,
[00:27:17.660 --> 00:27:20.900]   a little bit of ammonium nitrate.
[00:27:20.900 --> 00:27:22.660]   Anyway, and so I've been kind of dealing
[00:27:22.660 --> 00:27:23.820]   with it trying to get it to work.
[00:27:23.820 --> 00:27:26.380]   And I've been feeling really guilty as I take it off
[00:27:26.380 --> 00:27:28.860]   the charging cradle, because I keep thinking that's the mojo
[00:27:28.860 --> 00:27:32.060]   that everybody tells you is do not disturb the first.
[00:27:32.060 --> 00:27:34.260]   But you know what I wonder-- you, John, as somebody
[00:27:34.260 --> 00:27:38.140]   in the tech support vertical can answer this for me.
[00:27:38.140 --> 00:27:39.100]   The psychic tech support.
[00:27:39.100 --> 00:27:40.740]   The psychic tech support.
[00:27:40.740 --> 00:27:43.060]   I know what's wrong with your computer before it breaks.
[00:27:43.060 --> 00:27:46.180]   But I wonder if it's something to just ensure that before you
[00:27:46.180 --> 00:27:50.740]   call customer service, it's got a full charge.
[00:27:50.740 --> 00:27:53.340]   So basically, it's like a consumer hack where they're like,
[00:27:53.340 --> 00:27:55.820]   listen, oh, it's very important that this get charged
[00:27:55.820 --> 00:27:57.820]   all the way up, because I wonder how many of the problems
[00:27:57.820 --> 00:27:59.900]   happen, because somebody charged a part way.
[00:27:59.900 --> 00:28:02.860]   And that's not an issue.
[00:28:02.860 --> 00:28:05.180]   The thing is that tech support, when you call them,
[00:28:05.180 --> 00:28:06.820]   has a predefined list.
[00:28:06.820 --> 00:28:07.820]   And it's like the top 10.
[00:28:07.820 --> 00:28:09.380]   Is it plugged in?
[00:28:09.380 --> 00:28:10.500]   Is it charged up?
[00:28:10.500 --> 00:28:14.380]   Is it on?
[00:28:14.380 --> 00:28:17.940]   Is there something plugged into the speaker?
[00:28:17.940 --> 00:28:20.100]   Maybe taking the fake screen label off the front.
[00:28:20.100 --> 00:28:21.260]   Fake screen label off.
[00:28:21.260 --> 00:28:23.260]   How many times have you dropped it?
[00:28:23.260 --> 00:28:25.260]   How many times have you dropped it?
[00:28:25.260 --> 00:28:26.140]   That kind of thing.
[00:28:26.140 --> 00:28:28.980]   One of the things that really bothers me when I do tech
[00:28:28.980 --> 00:28:31.340]   support is that someone will call and they'll say, well,
[00:28:31.340 --> 00:28:32.380]   it does this and this and this.
[00:28:32.380 --> 00:28:34.460]   I'm like, OK, well, if you do this, what does it do?
[00:28:34.460 --> 00:28:36.820]   Oh, I'm not even near my computer.
[00:28:36.820 --> 00:28:41.260]   So the first rule of tech support is to have the computer
[00:28:41.260 --> 00:28:42.740]   on and be in front of it.
[00:28:42.740 --> 00:28:44.300]   That's like tricks of the trade had a great--
[00:28:44.300 --> 00:28:46.500]   you ever seen that tricks of the trade site where they talk
[00:28:46.500 --> 00:28:48.060]   about little bits of wisdom from people
[00:28:48.060 --> 00:28:49.060]   in different industries.
[00:28:49.060 --> 00:28:51.140]   And the best tech support one I ever heard was,
[00:28:51.140 --> 00:28:53.700]   is if you ask somebody if it's plugged in,
[00:28:53.700 --> 00:28:56.260]   they will always say that it's plugged in.
[00:28:56.260 --> 00:28:58.300]   And so the tech support trick supposedly
[00:28:58.300 --> 00:29:01.180]   is to ask somebody to quote unquote unplug it
[00:29:01.180 --> 00:29:03.300]   and then blow the dust out of the prongs
[00:29:03.300 --> 00:29:04.300]   and then plug it back in.
[00:29:04.300 --> 00:29:05.060]   That's a good one.
[00:29:05.060 --> 00:29:07.140]   That is a good one because it ensures that the person has
[00:29:07.140 --> 00:29:11.860]   to actually go and it lets them save their ego by going,
[00:29:11.860 --> 00:29:12.860]   oh, OK.
[00:29:12.860 --> 00:29:13.660]   Yeah, I blew it out.
[00:29:13.660 --> 00:29:15.780]   It's all good now.
[00:29:15.780 --> 00:29:17.620]   I don't know.
[00:29:17.620 --> 00:29:20.340]   It's kind of hard to get around the tech support guys,
[00:29:20.340 --> 00:29:24.020]   especially when it's me, because I've done all this voodoo.
[00:29:24.020 --> 00:29:26.860]   I've zapped the parameter, I'm rebooted.
[00:29:26.860 --> 00:29:27.340]   I've--
[00:29:27.340 --> 00:29:28.740]   What in the period?
[00:29:28.740 --> 00:29:30.580]   And you never know if it really is going to do--
[00:29:30.580 --> 00:29:31.540]   I still zapped the key rate.
[00:29:31.540 --> 00:29:32.220]   I don't even know why.
[00:29:32.220 --> 00:29:34.340]   When my computer isn't running correctly, I just go--
[00:29:34.340 --> 00:29:36.220]   Well, I've got a list of 10 things.
[00:29:36.220 --> 00:29:37.340]   It's totally rubber chicken time.
[00:29:37.340 --> 00:29:39.020]   OK, what are the 10 things?
[00:29:39.020 --> 00:29:40.700]   Well, it's funny, because I've zelled
[00:29:40.700 --> 00:29:42.620]   and posted this big thing one time about what he does
[00:29:42.620 --> 00:29:43.700]   before a software upgrade.
[00:29:43.700 --> 00:29:44.620]   And then, of course, it's--
[00:29:44.620 --> 00:29:44.980]   It's totally--
[00:29:44.980 --> 00:29:46.580]   Reverend Gruber came back with all the things.
[00:29:46.580 --> 00:29:47.580]   Oh, man.
[00:29:47.580 --> 00:29:49.420]   Hey, banana.
[00:29:49.420 --> 00:29:50.580]   40 minutes.
[00:29:50.580 --> 00:29:52.260]   But for me, there's all--
[00:29:52.260 --> 00:29:53.180]   I have a pretty--
[00:29:53.180 --> 00:29:54.940]   I mean, I don't want to get that a rat hole,
[00:29:54.940 --> 00:29:57.700]   but this is-- for what it's worth, what I do is I--
[00:29:57.700 --> 00:29:59.300]   of course, you do a restart.
[00:29:59.300 --> 00:30:01.140]   I come up in single user mode.
[00:30:01.140 --> 00:30:01.980]   I run Applejack.
[00:30:01.980 --> 00:30:03.420]   How do you come up in single user mode?
[00:30:03.420 --> 00:30:05.100]   So you do a restart.
[00:30:05.100 --> 00:30:07.940]   After you hear the tone, you hold down Apple S.
[00:30:07.940 --> 00:30:09.500]   And you come up in a shell.
[00:30:09.500 --> 00:30:10.100]   In a shell, OK.
[00:30:10.100 --> 00:30:10.300]   Yeah.
[00:30:10.300 --> 00:30:13.140]   And so, I mean, if you have Applejack installed,
[00:30:13.140 --> 00:30:14.540]   there's all kinds of cool stuff you can do.
[00:30:14.540 --> 00:30:14.940]   If you don't--
[00:30:14.940 --> 00:30:15.740]   What is Applejack?
[00:30:15.740 --> 00:30:17.420]   Applejack is a program that you install.
[00:30:17.420 --> 00:30:20.580]   It's this great little freeware app that you install that
[00:30:20.580 --> 00:30:22.300]   runs-- it installs a little script
[00:30:22.300 --> 00:30:24.740]   so that when you start up in single user mode--
[00:30:24.740 --> 00:30:26.380]   this is a previous pick of the week for me.
[00:30:26.380 --> 00:30:28.940]   You basically can type in Applejack at the command line.
[00:30:28.940 --> 00:30:33.100]   And it will, in order, it will do an FSCK.
[00:30:33.100 --> 00:30:35.460]   So it will fix your disk.
[00:30:35.460 --> 00:30:37.980]   It will fix your permissions.
[00:30:37.980 --> 00:30:40.820]   It will delete caches.
[00:30:40.820 --> 00:30:47.660]   It will check your preferences, get rid of your sleep image,
[00:30:47.660 --> 00:30:49.740]   and kind of all the basic rubber chicken stuff.
[00:30:49.740 --> 00:30:52.100]   And I think it should actually spin a rubber chicken.
[00:30:52.100 --> 00:30:53.660]   It'd be great if it had a little virtual--
[00:30:53.660 --> 00:30:54.140]   A little animation.
[00:30:54.140 --> 00:30:57.220]   --asky rubber chicken.
[00:30:57.220 --> 00:30:59.220]   And then it will restart for you.
[00:30:59.220 --> 00:31:00.900]   So to me, that's one way.
[00:31:00.900 --> 00:31:03.860]   And again, I mean, it used to be back in the day.
[00:31:03.860 --> 00:31:06.780]   You used to have to run Norton every week
[00:31:06.780 --> 00:31:08.940]   because there would be catalog damage or whatever.
[00:31:08.940 --> 00:31:12.180]   And I don't know what it is if it's just the Unix or whatever.
[00:31:12.180 --> 00:31:13.980]   But it feels much more forgiving nowadays.
[00:31:13.980 --> 00:31:16.100]   But I've said this a dozen times on the show.
[00:31:16.100 --> 00:31:18.620]   But a lot of times, if you're getting a lot of beach balls
[00:31:18.620 --> 00:31:21.020]   in my experience, it's because you have very, very, very
[00:31:21.020 --> 00:31:22.580]   slight disk damage.
[00:31:22.580 --> 00:31:23.620]   Or it could just be--
[00:31:23.620 --> 00:31:27.380]   but if you run an FSCK, you can get rid of a lot of stupid problems.
[00:31:27.380 --> 00:31:29.900]   I just want to jump in here as a result
[00:31:29.900 --> 00:31:31.100]   of your pick of the week, Merlin.
[00:31:31.100 --> 00:31:32.860]   I did try Apple Jack.
[00:31:32.860 --> 00:31:34.100]   Did it work for you?
[00:31:34.100 --> 00:31:35.420]   Didn't not work.
[00:31:35.420 --> 00:31:39.420]   Well, there's an upgrade for Intel.
[00:31:39.420 --> 00:31:40.580]   I got that one.
[00:31:40.580 --> 00:31:45.380]   The problem is I had that terrible invalid node error.
[00:31:45.380 --> 00:31:46.740]   I don't know if you guys ever get that.
[00:31:46.740 --> 00:31:49.180]   But that's like the kiss of death error where Apple just
[00:31:49.180 --> 00:31:51.860]   tells you, sorry, you got to reinstall everything.
[00:31:51.860 --> 00:31:52.340]   So what I'm--
[00:31:52.340 --> 00:31:54.140]   Sounds like a job for disk warrior.
[00:31:54.140 --> 00:31:54.820]   Yeah.
[00:31:54.820 --> 00:31:58.700]   I went out and got TechTool Deluxe Pro.
[00:31:58.700 --> 00:31:59.580]   Did that work?
[00:31:59.580 --> 00:32:00.820]   It worked like a dream.
[00:32:00.820 --> 00:32:01.780]   Oh, awesome.
[00:32:01.780 --> 00:32:03.980]   I've always said there's two kinds of people in this world.
[00:32:03.980 --> 00:32:06.460]   There's people who use disk warrior and people who will eventually
[00:32:06.460 --> 00:32:07.740]   use disk warrior.
[00:32:07.740 --> 00:32:08.660]   Because it was just--
[00:32:08.660 --> 00:32:11.540]   Yeah, it was available in Intel yet, though.
[00:32:11.540 --> 00:32:17.020]   I'm the guy who doesn't back up before he updates a system.
[00:32:17.020 --> 00:32:18.460]   I don't do any of this.
[00:32:18.460 --> 00:32:20.300]   I don't do any of this management.
[00:32:20.300 --> 00:32:26.380]   I very, very, very seldom do a rebuild permissions or repair
[00:32:26.380 --> 00:32:26.980]   permissions.
[00:32:26.980 --> 00:32:31.540]   I mean, some of this stuff is just hocus pocus voodoo.
[00:32:31.540 --> 00:32:32.980]   Until tonight.
[00:32:32.980 --> 00:32:34.100]   It's like admitting you grow weed.
[00:32:34.100 --> 00:32:36.060]   You're in so much trouble now that you've admitted all of this.
[00:32:36.060 --> 00:32:37.220]   Well, no, no, I'm not.
[00:32:37.220 --> 00:32:38.700]   I'm not in any trouble at all.
[00:32:38.700 --> 00:32:42.260]   I think that this goes back to the whole issue of tech support.
[00:32:42.260 --> 00:32:45.380]   Tech support likes to go and blame stuff.
[00:32:45.380 --> 00:32:48.020]   They like to give the person here, go and try this.
[00:32:48.020 --> 00:32:49.260]   And that gets them off the phone.
[00:32:49.260 --> 00:32:51.460]   And they've got to go do something else.
[00:32:51.460 --> 00:32:56.300]   And maybe the problem will go away because it does.
[00:32:56.300 --> 00:32:59.020]   Or the person's just being really silly.
[00:32:59.020 --> 00:33:00.620]   And they're thinking that they have a problem
[00:33:00.620 --> 00:33:02.220]   that they don't actually have.
[00:33:02.220 --> 00:33:08.500]   And so some of the time, once in a blue moon,
[00:33:08.500 --> 00:33:09.780]   it'll actually fix something.
[00:33:09.780 --> 00:33:11.580]   But for the most part, this is just hocus pocus.
[00:33:11.580 --> 00:33:12.580]   But it might have been accidental.
[00:33:12.580 --> 00:33:13.860]   It might have been unrelated.
[00:33:13.860 --> 00:33:14.420]   Yeah, it's unrelated.
[00:33:14.420 --> 00:33:17.820]   For me, when I was in the little admin of our little network
[00:33:17.820 --> 00:33:21.540]   at work in the early '90s, I confided to somebody one day
[00:33:21.540 --> 00:33:24.420]   that I wouldn't even have a job if people would realize
[00:33:24.420 --> 00:33:27.740]   that over 80% of their problems could be solved by restarting.
[00:33:27.740 --> 00:33:28.300]   Exactly.
[00:33:28.300 --> 00:33:31.020]   Well, it's probably less true now.
[00:33:31.020 --> 00:33:32.420]   But back in the day, it was--
[00:33:32.420 --> 00:33:33.340]   I still lose some major.
[00:33:33.340 --> 00:33:34.900]   --it's things don't feel like they're going to do.
[00:33:34.900 --> 00:33:35.580]   I want to try it today.
[00:33:35.580 --> 00:33:37.420]   A lot of people are really into their uptime and stuff
[00:33:37.420 --> 00:33:37.860]   like that.
[00:33:37.860 --> 00:33:39.580]   So they kind of don't want to lose their cred.
[00:33:39.580 --> 00:33:40.740]   But look at this.
[00:33:40.740 --> 00:33:43.300]   If you restart or if you're looking at your machine,
[00:33:43.300 --> 00:33:45.360]   you're like, where did all my disk space go?
[00:33:45.360 --> 00:33:47.100]   It's Photoshop took it and hit it.
[00:33:47.100 --> 00:33:48.540]   Photoshop took it and hit it.
[00:33:48.540 --> 00:33:49.740]   Safari took it and hit it.
[00:33:49.740 --> 00:33:51.220]   The Finder took it and hit it.
[00:33:51.220 --> 00:33:54.380]   Everything that made a cache.
[00:33:54.380 --> 00:33:57.940]   Went and used a little bit of disk and didn't give it back.
[00:33:57.940 --> 00:33:59.660]   Yeah, I mean, the one that swapped files--
[00:33:59.660 --> 00:34:00.940]   Yeah, you're running out of room.
[00:34:00.940 --> 00:34:02.020]   Now you're running out of room.
[00:34:02.020 --> 00:34:04.340]   And if you don't even have to restart,
[00:34:04.340 --> 00:34:06.620]   if you just log out and log back in,
[00:34:06.620 --> 00:34:09.620]   you get like magical three gigs of disk space back.
[00:34:09.620 --> 00:34:11.380]   No, no, no, that's something I do a lot.
[00:34:11.380 --> 00:34:13.020]   Now, to change the subject completely,
[00:34:13.020 --> 00:34:14.500]   because I think that some people are going, OK,
[00:34:14.500 --> 00:34:16.700]   I don't care about my computer anymore.
[00:34:16.700 --> 00:34:18.060]   There was this interesting article on it.
[00:34:18.060 --> 00:34:20.860]   And I decided-- I think we should go around and figure this out.
[00:34:20.860 --> 00:34:24.140]   Because we had some headphone discussions earlier today
[00:34:24.140 --> 00:34:29.420]   is on sci-fi.com, they have the top five best ways
[00:34:29.420 --> 00:34:31.420]   to listen to your iPod.
[00:34:31.420 --> 00:34:32.980]   Now, it was just a list of--
[00:34:32.980 --> 00:34:34.460]   they're just listing a bunch of headphones.
[00:34:34.460 --> 00:34:39.740]   But I was curious what everyone uses as their primary headphones--
[00:34:39.740 --> 00:34:42.100]   their primary cans.
[00:34:42.100 --> 00:34:43.460]   That's what we call them in the business.
[00:34:43.460 --> 00:34:44.460]   That's what we call them in the business.
[00:34:44.460 --> 00:34:44.820]   We call them cans.
[00:34:44.820 --> 00:34:45.620]   Is that what you call them, John?
[00:34:45.620 --> 00:34:46.660]   We call them cans.
[00:34:46.660 --> 00:34:48.260]   You call them cans, Scott?
[00:34:48.260 --> 00:34:49.700]   Yes, we call them cans.
[00:34:49.700 --> 00:34:50.260]   Cans.
[00:34:50.260 --> 00:34:54.060]   So Scott, Scott, what kind of cans do you wear primarily?
[00:34:54.060 --> 00:34:57.060]   Well, you see, when it comes to headphones,
[00:34:57.060 --> 00:34:59.500]   you can't own too many.
[00:34:59.500 --> 00:35:00.540]   But what are your primary?
[00:35:00.540 --> 00:35:01.940]   What's your primary cans?
[00:35:01.940 --> 00:35:04.340]   Well, I spend more time in my studio
[00:35:04.340 --> 00:35:05.540]   than I do on my iPod.
[00:35:05.540 --> 00:35:10.300]   In my studio, it's the venerable AKG K240S,
[00:35:10.300 --> 00:35:12.580]   which is the headphone of choice in most radio
[00:35:12.580 --> 00:35:14.260]   stations in America.
[00:35:14.260 --> 00:35:16.380]   And I love those phones, and I'm fact
[00:35:16.380 --> 00:35:18.140]   I'm wearing a pair right now.
[00:35:18.140 --> 00:35:20.500]   But if I'm out on the road with my iPod
[00:35:20.500 --> 00:35:23.900]   trying to not carry around giant headphones,
[00:35:23.900 --> 00:35:27.460]   I use the same sure earbuds that you do, Alex.
[00:35:27.460 --> 00:35:30.460]   Those are the I3--
[00:35:30.460 --> 00:35:32.980]   This is the about $3,000 ones.
[00:35:32.980 --> 00:35:34.180]   A couple hundred bucks.
[00:35:34.180 --> 00:35:36.300]   About $180.
[00:35:36.300 --> 00:35:37.460]   I really like those a lot.
[00:35:37.460 --> 00:35:42.620]   I have also a pair of the Bose QuietComfort, blah, blah, blah.
[00:35:42.620 --> 00:35:43.100]   I don't like--
[00:35:43.100 --> 00:35:43.580]   I don't like--
[00:35:43.580 --> 00:35:44.620]   --but they're a little bulky.
[00:35:44.620 --> 00:35:46.060]   I don't like noise canceling headphones
[00:35:46.060 --> 00:35:49.020]   because I can hear the noise canceling.
[00:35:49.020 --> 00:35:51.060]   Yeah, they work pretty good on a plane other than that.
[00:35:51.060 --> 00:35:52.500]   I don't have any use for them.
[00:35:52.500 --> 00:35:55.580]   But the sure ones I tend to like a little bit better
[00:35:55.580 --> 00:35:56.900]   just because they're not so bulky
[00:35:56.900 --> 00:35:59.980]   and you don't have to listen to the noise canceling circuitry.
[00:35:59.980 --> 00:36:04.820]   But the K240S is the comfortable, even flat headphone.
[00:36:04.820 --> 00:36:07.220]   And I want to stress, if you're doing any kind of audio
[00:36:07.220 --> 00:36:10.900]   editing, you don't want those earbuds that add lots of bass
[00:36:10.900 --> 00:36:12.780]   because then you're going to get an incorrect picture
[00:36:12.780 --> 00:36:13.620]   of your sound.
[00:36:13.620 --> 00:36:15.500]   You want something with a flat response,
[00:36:15.500 --> 00:36:18.660]   and that's where the K240s come in.
[00:36:18.660 --> 00:36:19.620]   Merlin, what do you mean?
[00:36:19.620 --> 00:36:20.420]   Oh, let me look at mine.
[00:36:20.420 --> 00:36:22.220]   Well, I've got a pair of those surers.
[00:36:22.220 --> 00:36:24.820]   Mine were-- I don't know if they were 180,
[00:36:24.820 --> 00:36:28.180]   but they're those surers that most people use.
[00:36:28.180 --> 00:36:31.340]   I hate the in-the-ear headphones.
[00:36:31.340 --> 00:36:33.140]   But the problem is, if I go around on Muni,
[00:36:33.140 --> 00:36:35.780]   our local transit with these big-ass headphones on,
[00:36:35.780 --> 00:36:36.580]   I feel like a total dork.
[00:36:36.580 --> 00:36:39.740]   But having said that, these are recommended to me,
[00:36:39.740 --> 00:36:41.860]   I think, by my friend Dan Cohen, if memory serves.
[00:36:41.860 --> 00:36:45.460]   And these are the Sony MDR-V600 dynamic stereo headphones.
[00:36:45.460 --> 00:36:48.620]   They're DJ headphones, which means that the little can
[00:36:48.620 --> 00:36:52.060]   parts flip around, which also makes them easy to fold and put away.
[00:36:52.060 --> 00:36:52.900]   I like those a lot.
[00:36:52.900 --> 00:36:55.860]   To answer your larger question, I tend
[00:36:55.860 --> 00:36:59.940]   to listen to iTunes over the speakers at my desk.
[00:36:59.940 --> 00:37:02.940]   And I actually, believe it or not,
[00:37:02.940 --> 00:37:06.860]   I use the stupid air tunes streaming.
[00:37:06.860 --> 00:37:09.340]   And I stream it to three airport expresses in my house,
[00:37:09.340 --> 00:37:10.420]   which I like a lot.
[00:37:10.420 --> 00:37:12.660]   And it magically syncs all the music in a way
[00:37:12.660 --> 00:37:13.300]   that blows my mind.
[00:37:13.300 --> 00:37:15.660]   And then finally, if I'm down in the garage
[00:37:15.660 --> 00:37:19.780]   in my special cigar smoking area, I have a big-ass boom
[00:37:19.780 --> 00:37:20.940]   box I just play it through.
[00:37:20.940 --> 00:37:22.740]   So that's not very interesting.
[00:37:22.740 --> 00:37:24.380]   But I like these cans, though.
[00:37:24.380 --> 00:37:27.140]   I like sand cans.
[00:37:27.140 --> 00:37:27.740]   John?
[00:37:27.740 --> 00:37:32.660]   I use the $10 Sony headphone earbuds.
[00:37:32.660 --> 00:37:34.900]   You're so refreshing.
[00:37:34.900 --> 00:37:37.820]   Well, the reason is, is that the little spinny case
[00:37:37.820 --> 00:37:40.500]   that comes with them-- so you put it in and you wind it up--
[00:37:40.500 --> 00:37:43.820]   so you can't seem to find that spinny case
[00:37:43.820 --> 00:37:46.900]   with the more expensive heads earbuds.
[00:37:46.900 --> 00:37:48.100]   And it's-- you know, I like to be
[00:37:48.100 --> 00:37:50.900]   able to put those in my pocket instead of in that case.
[00:37:50.900 --> 00:37:53.260]   Rather than put the whole mess of wire in there
[00:37:53.260 --> 00:37:59.220]   and then have to untangle it when I want to just jam out.
[00:37:59.220 --> 00:38:01.180]   Yeah, so I have the shears.
[00:38:01.180 --> 00:38:05.700]   And I pretty much-- there are occasions in the week
[00:38:05.700 --> 00:38:08.420]   that I do not have the shears in my front pocket.
[00:38:08.420 --> 00:38:11.100]   But they are few and far between.
[00:38:11.100 --> 00:38:15.060]   I mean, you know, it's like-- they're always somewhere nearby.
[00:38:15.060 --> 00:38:17.180]   One of the things I like about them is that they--
[00:38:17.180 --> 00:38:19.580]   A, they give me the problem with using--
[00:38:19.580 --> 00:38:22.660]   typically using-- since I do a lot of production,
[00:38:22.660 --> 00:38:25.300]   I don't want to hear-- I don't want my mic hearing my headphones.
[00:38:25.300 --> 00:38:28.660]   And so they're nice because they don't transmit the sound.
[00:38:28.660 --> 00:38:31.140]   The other thing is, is they're like having ear plugs with music.
[00:38:31.140 --> 00:38:32.100]   You know, and I use--
[00:38:32.100 --> 00:38:33.780]   I'm so into you having ear plugs wherever I go.
[00:38:33.780 --> 00:38:36.700]   And I have the super flangey ones.
[00:38:36.700 --> 00:38:38.420]   So it's not just the little--
[00:38:38.420 --> 00:38:41.660]   When you buy the shears, you get these one little round
[00:38:41.660 --> 00:38:42.700]   that goes a little into your ear.
[00:38:42.700 --> 00:38:44.380]   You guys can't see this at home, but Alex has
[00:38:44.380 --> 00:38:49.380]   this weird little slightly sexual triple dip penetrator.
[00:38:49.380 --> 00:38:50.380]   Earpiece.
[00:38:50.380 --> 00:38:51.380]   Then it was so funny.
[00:38:51.380 --> 00:38:53.020]   It's pretty imposing.
[00:38:53.020 --> 00:38:55.020]   Well, what was worse was on the way to Africa.
[00:38:55.020 --> 00:39:01.300]   They actually-- I found some headphones, some actual--
[00:39:01.300 --> 00:39:05.420]   they were-- now I can't think of-- ear plugs in London.
[00:39:05.420 --> 00:39:07.100]   So in Heathrow, they had these ear plugs.
[00:39:07.100 --> 00:39:09.380]   And they had this thing where you could change how much they
[00:39:09.380 --> 00:39:09.740]   plugged.
[00:39:09.740 --> 00:39:10.700]   So I hear it.
[00:39:10.700 --> 00:39:11.820]   Little plunges that would go in the middle.
[00:39:11.820 --> 00:39:13.740]   And I realized it was-- and I looked at the other end,
[00:39:13.740 --> 00:39:14.340]   and it was open.
[00:39:14.340 --> 00:39:16.780]   And I realized it was the same thing except longer.
[00:39:16.780 --> 00:39:20.580]   And so I bought it for $15 and then snipped it a little bit.
[00:39:20.580 --> 00:39:21.580]   And stuck them on.
[00:39:21.580 --> 00:39:23.420]   And now the problem with that one is it feels like you're
[00:39:23.420 --> 00:39:25.940]   getting-- I mean, it feels like it's surgically
[00:39:25.940 --> 00:39:27.020]   implanting into your ears.
[00:39:27.020 --> 00:39:29.420]   And it actually hurt to take them out of my ears.
[00:39:29.420 --> 00:39:30.260]   So I stopped using this.
[00:39:30.260 --> 00:39:31.620]   So why would you take them out?
[00:39:31.620 --> 00:39:32.180]   Well, I didn't.
[00:39:32.180 --> 00:39:33.460]   I'd leave them in there for 10 hours.
[00:39:33.460 --> 00:39:36.340]   And I'd look up at the-- I'd look up at the stewardess--
[00:39:36.340 --> 00:39:37.140]   We had the waitress.
[00:39:37.140 --> 00:39:37.860]   The stewardess.
[00:39:37.860 --> 00:39:39.860]   And I saw the waitress.
[00:39:39.860 --> 00:39:40.420]   It is not--
[00:39:40.420 --> 00:39:40.820]   It is light and--
[00:39:40.820 --> 00:39:41.260]   It is light and--
[00:39:41.260 --> 00:39:42.780]   It is light and--
[00:39:42.780 --> 00:39:44.500]   Welcome to the century.
[00:39:44.500 --> 00:39:46.300]   So--
[00:39:46.300 --> 00:39:48.140]   Send your emails to Alex.
[00:39:48.140 --> 00:39:49.660]   Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, I didn't say it.
[00:39:49.660 --> 00:39:51.540]   All right, so-- oh, I did say that, didn't I?
[00:39:51.540 --> 00:39:55.300]   So anyway, so the--
[00:39:55.300 --> 00:39:59.020]   but when the flight attendant talked to me with these on,
[00:39:59.020 --> 00:40:01.660]   when I'm listening to something, this is what I hear.
[00:40:01.660 --> 00:40:02.260]   Really?
[00:40:02.260 --> 00:40:02.860]   Pretty much.
[00:40:02.860 --> 00:40:04.060]   I don't hear anything.
[00:40:04.060 --> 00:40:07.140]   Well, what's nice-- I mean, I use a couple of different kinds.
[00:40:07.140 --> 00:40:09.460]   I like the hushers, which are those-- as far as earplugs.
[00:40:09.460 --> 00:40:11.420]   There's the little foam ones that you kind of
[00:40:11.420 --> 00:40:13.660]   ball into a little tight cylinder than the expanding
[00:40:13.660 --> 00:40:15.100]   rear, and those are great.
[00:40:15.100 --> 00:40:16.700]   I mean, they're not good for playing a band.
[00:40:16.700 --> 00:40:17.900]   You're using them with the shirts?
[00:40:17.900 --> 00:40:19.100]   No, no, I was talking about just more
[00:40:19.100 --> 00:40:20.100]   from what you're hearing.
[00:40:20.100 --> 00:40:21.620]   You're talking about-- you're talking about for hearing--
[00:40:21.620 --> 00:40:24.300]   I'm talking about-- I always put them in so that I have music.
[00:40:24.300 --> 00:40:24.980]   Yeah.
[00:40:24.980 --> 00:40:26.740]   Yeah, sometimes I just don't want to hear anything.
[00:40:26.740 --> 00:40:27.180]   No, the other thing--
[00:40:27.180 --> 00:40:28.300]   Like on a plane, you know?
[00:40:28.300 --> 00:40:30.060]   I'm invariably in the crying baby section,
[00:40:30.060 --> 00:40:31.220]   no matter where I'm seated.
[00:40:31.220 --> 00:40:32.020]   I'm not like Scott.
[00:40:32.020 --> 00:40:34.940]   I'm not up in the horizontally challenged section.
[00:40:34.940 --> 00:40:37.340]   So did you bring the baby, or did you just borrow the baby?
[00:40:37.340 --> 00:40:37.860]   I do.
[00:40:37.860 --> 00:40:40.380]   I have a baby that I bring on every flight just to--
[00:40:40.380 --> 00:40:41.740]   And you don't feed him for a couple days.
[00:40:41.740 --> 00:40:42.900]   He's just honoring.
[00:40:42.900 --> 00:40:44.500]   It's the same way I train a pit bull.
[00:40:44.500 --> 00:40:45.500]   I get a real angry.
[00:40:45.500 --> 00:40:46.780]   Yeah, don't feed it.
[00:40:46.780 --> 00:40:48.620]   It's actually an option on orbits.
[00:40:48.620 --> 00:40:52.820]   You can check off seat near Merlin where the baby's sit.
[00:40:52.820 --> 00:40:54.020]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:40:54.020 --> 00:40:57.100]   So the-- now, when I'm in the office,
[00:40:57.100 --> 00:41:00.220]   I use this huge M station tower.
[00:41:00.220 --> 00:41:02.460]   And I can't think of what it's called other than the tower.
[00:41:02.460 --> 00:41:04.260]   I saw that in the sky mall the other day,
[00:41:04.260 --> 00:41:05.420]   and I thought, you--
[00:41:05.420 --> 00:41:07.300]   Right next to the monogram dog saddle.
[00:41:07.300 --> 00:41:08.460]   It is awesome.
[00:41:08.460 --> 00:41:09.900]   It's like 300 bucks.
[00:41:09.900 --> 00:41:11.620]   Now, it looks a little funky.
[00:41:11.620 --> 00:41:13.300]   Like, when you look at it, it's kind of--
[00:41:13.300 --> 00:41:15.380]   It's very-- Alex, I didn't want to say anything
[00:41:15.380 --> 00:41:16.660]   because I don't want to out you.
[00:41:16.660 --> 00:41:18.500]   No, there's just a lot of things in your life
[00:41:18.500 --> 00:41:20.260]   that look like something from Logan's run.
[00:41:20.260 --> 00:41:21.100]   And this is--
[00:41:21.100 --> 00:41:23.580]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:41:23.580 --> 00:41:25.940]   And given that you probably should have gone to Carousel
[00:41:25.940 --> 00:41:28.860]   at least a couple of years ago, it's just-- it's kind of funny.
[00:41:28.860 --> 00:41:29.820]   Carousel.
[00:41:29.820 --> 00:41:30.900]   Carousel.
[00:41:30.900 --> 00:41:35.380]   So I noticed that Alex went red last year.
[00:41:35.380 --> 00:41:36.580]   I went red?
[00:41:36.580 --> 00:41:37.460]   Yes.
[00:41:37.460 --> 00:41:38.940]   Oh, I just-- I have to excuse me.
[00:41:38.940 --> 00:41:39.620]   I'm explaining.
[00:41:39.620 --> 00:41:41.220]   Because out of the corner of my eye,
[00:41:41.220 --> 00:41:45.740]   I just noticed one of our topics just came up in my RSS feed.
[00:41:45.740 --> 00:41:46.180]   Oh, cool.
[00:41:46.180 --> 00:41:47.540]   Yeah, we should talk about that.
[00:41:47.540 --> 00:41:51.380]   Can we talk a little bit about mass big ass storage?
[00:41:51.380 --> 00:41:53.900]   And the issues of huge ass hard drives?
[00:41:53.900 --> 00:41:54.860]   Is that boring to you, Alex?
[00:41:54.860 --> 00:41:56.380]   I have lots of huge ass hard drives.
[00:41:56.380 --> 00:42:00.420]   I watched your tedious Mac break about how you shoot the show
[00:42:00.420 --> 00:42:01.540]   and your array.
[00:42:01.540 --> 00:42:03.940]   It was very interesting.
[00:42:03.940 --> 00:42:06.220]   For being as tedious as it was, it was really, really good.
[00:42:06.220 --> 00:42:06.820]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:42:06.820 --> 00:42:07.300]   Nice.
[00:42:07.300 --> 00:42:10.540]   No, no, before the show, I paid Alex the biggest compliment
[00:42:10.540 --> 00:42:12.180]   I can ever give to somebody else, which is to say,
[00:42:12.180 --> 00:42:13.700]   I hate the kind of thing that you did,
[00:42:13.700 --> 00:42:15.860]   but I really like the one that you did.
[00:42:15.860 --> 00:42:17.980]   Alex did a tour of how they shoot Mac break.
[00:42:17.980 --> 00:42:20.380]   He showed how they light it and how they use the cameras
[00:42:20.380 --> 00:42:24.860]   and how they record-- how much is one show in terms of gigs?
[00:42:24.860 --> 00:42:29.260]   One show typically uses about when we record it,
[00:42:29.260 --> 00:42:31.780]   about 360 to 400 gigabytes.
[00:42:31.780 --> 00:42:32.540]   Wow, that adds up.
[00:42:32.540 --> 00:42:34.020]   And then you do a backup.
[00:42:34.020 --> 00:42:35.300]   Yeah, you want to have two copies.
[00:42:35.300 --> 00:42:36.660]   Can you do a backup with some kind of--
[00:42:36.660 --> 00:42:37.860]   No, no, no.
[00:42:37.860 --> 00:42:40.020]   We now have-- well, we back up the shows.
[00:42:40.020 --> 00:42:41.500]   This is so we haven't gotten into this part yet.
[00:42:41.500 --> 00:42:42.900]   We're going to do another tedious one
[00:42:42.900 --> 00:42:43.860]   so that people can watch it.
[00:42:43.860 --> 00:42:44.860]   Sweet.
[00:42:44.860 --> 00:42:51.180]   The-- we do-- we used-- I mean, we back up some stuff,
[00:42:51.180 --> 00:42:56.220]   but usually one of our raids is a 5.0 raid, and a raid 5.
[00:42:56.220 --> 00:42:58.220]   So four of them are--
[00:42:58.220 --> 00:42:59.940]   just one of them breaks four of them are OK.
[00:42:59.940 --> 00:43:00.900]   We have-- yeah, we have--
[00:43:00.900 --> 00:43:01.380]   It's a 5, right?
[00:43:01.380 --> 00:43:02.820]   Yeah, we have 14 drives.
[00:43:02.820 --> 00:43:05.900]   I think we can have two or three drives go bad.
[00:43:05.900 --> 00:43:06.420]   Is that right?
[00:43:06.420 --> 00:43:09.380]   Three drives go bad before we lose any data.
[00:43:09.380 --> 00:43:10.460]   And we've actually had it.
[00:43:10.460 --> 00:43:11.380]   It's this crazy thing.
[00:43:11.380 --> 00:43:13.500]   We've had a drive go bad in one of our 5--
[00:43:13.500 --> 00:43:15.700]   No, you get to swap it out and then let's go overnight.
[00:43:15.700 --> 00:43:16.780]   We ordered--
[00:43:16.780 --> 00:43:18.780]   It's covered by Apple's Apple-- you know, AppleCare,
[00:43:18.780 --> 00:43:20.540]   whatever we have, the one year warranty,
[00:43:20.540 --> 00:43:21.620]   or whatever with the X-ray.
[00:43:21.620 --> 00:43:23.300]   And so we called them.
[00:43:23.300 --> 00:43:24.340]   They sent us a new drive.
[00:43:24.340 --> 00:43:26.900]   We pulled the bad drive out that's making the noise.
[00:43:26.900 --> 00:43:27.820]   Or it's not even making noise.
[00:43:27.820 --> 00:43:30.580]   It just helps giving us a light that says it says it's bad.
[00:43:30.580 --> 00:43:31.340]   So we pulled it out.
[00:43:31.340 --> 00:43:32.460]   We sent that back to Apple.
[00:43:32.460 --> 00:43:34.380]   We shoved the new drive in.
[00:43:34.380 --> 00:43:39.220]   And over about a day, it just reforms into the system.
[00:43:39.220 --> 00:43:41.100]   Let me know, we didn't do anything.
[00:43:41.100 --> 00:43:41.980]   We just plugged it in.
[00:43:41.980 --> 00:43:43.660]   Two words, Alex.
[00:43:43.660 --> 00:43:45.100]   Logan's run.
[00:43:45.100 --> 00:43:46.660]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:43:46.660 --> 00:43:48.900]   Well, this is something I brought up a couple weeks ago.
[00:43:48.900 --> 00:43:49.940]   I missed last week's show.
[00:43:49.940 --> 00:43:53.140]   But I have been struggling with trying to figure out
[00:43:53.140 --> 00:43:55.820]   the best way to handle very large amounts of storage.
[00:43:55.820 --> 00:43:59.140]   I'm sick of buying 250 gig LSE drives
[00:43:59.140 --> 00:44:01.380]   and seeing them pile up like cordwood.
[00:44:01.380 --> 00:44:02.860]   And so we put it out to listeners.
[00:44:02.860 --> 00:44:05.060]   And we talked a little bit amongst ourselves.
[00:44:05.060 --> 00:44:07.900]   And we want to talk about a few of the easy ways,
[00:44:07.900 --> 00:44:09.980]   if you're a Mac user, to deal with very large storage.
[00:44:09.980 --> 00:44:11.740]   And John, you have some expertise in this issue.
[00:44:11.740 --> 00:44:13.300]   Yeah, well, I've been spending--
[00:44:13.300 --> 00:44:16.700]   I spent-- started this project three years ago knowing
[00:44:16.700 --> 00:44:20.260]   that I would have to deal with massive data.
[00:44:20.260 --> 00:44:27.620]   And how to build it so that I'm not dealing with a vendor.
[00:44:27.620 --> 00:44:29.420]   I wanted to be able to do it myself.
[00:44:29.420 --> 00:44:34.660]   Because bulk drives, anytime you can just
[00:44:34.660 --> 00:44:37.260]   go to this computer store and buy a drive,
[00:44:37.260 --> 00:44:40.860]   then you're not waiting around for somebody
[00:44:40.860 --> 00:44:41.940]   to fix it.
[00:44:41.940 --> 00:44:43.020]   You're doing it yourself.
[00:44:43.020 --> 00:44:45.260]   We're talking about the actual pop-in-in now.
[00:44:45.260 --> 00:44:46.420]   Yeah, just how you drive.
[00:44:46.420 --> 00:44:46.580]   Yeah.
[00:44:46.580 --> 00:44:53.980]   So speaking of cordwood, I have all these old G4s and G3s
[00:44:53.980 --> 00:44:56.620]   that are basically not doing any work anymore.
[00:44:56.620 --> 00:44:58.860]   And I feel like I've paid too much--
[00:44:58.860 --> 00:44:59.660]   Towers.
[00:44:59.660 --> 00:45:00.300]   You do towers?
[00:45:00.300 --> 00:45:00.860]   Yeah, towers.
[00:45:00.860 --> 00:45:03.820]   Old gray ones and even a blue and white--
[00:45:03.820 --> 00:45:04.220]   The salmon.
[00:45:04.220 --> 00:45:04.740]   G3.
[00:45:04.740 --> 00:45:05.220]   Yeah.
[00:45:05.220 --> 00:45:05.860]   I have one of those.
[00:45:05.860 --> 00:45:09.100]   And what the hell do you do with them?
[00:45:09.100 --> 00:45:11.860]   I could donate them, but I'd rather put them to use.
[00:45:11.860 --> 00:45:16.740]   Scott can empty out the guts and use them
[00:45:16.740 --> 00:45:18.220]   to hide his German bearer bonds.
[00:45:18.220 --> 00:45:19.100]   That's true.
[00:45:19.100 --> 00:45:20.980]   Quit it.
[00:45:20.980 --> 00:45:23.740]   But the idea is that you take some drives.
[00:45:23.740 --> 00:45:26.860]   You take a 400 or 500 gigabyte-- excuse me--
[00:45:26.860 --> 00:45:33.860]   500 gigabyte drives and get a serial ATA controller
[00:45:33.860 --> 00:45:36.620]   and rate them up.
[00:45:36.620 --> 00:45:38.140]   And then you can use that old--
[00:45:38.140 --> 00:45:42.380]   or then it's a network storage device automatically.
[00:45:42.380 --> 00:45:45.340]   And so for somebody who's, say, a power user as opposed
[00:45:45.340 --> 00:45:47.260]   to a major league geek, how hard
[00:45:47.260 --> 00:45:48.500]   would it be for somebody to set that up?
[00:45:48.500 --> 00:45:49.420]   Really easy.
[00:45:49.420 --> 00:45:51.660]   I mean, it's basically you're putting four drives
[00:45:51.660 --> 00:45:53.340]   into this Mac.
[00:45:53.340 --> 00:45:55.060]   And granted, it's probably right there
[00:45:55.060 --> 00:45:58.420]   on the edge of the power of what that is.
[00:45:58.420 --> 00:46:00.140]   But it's super easy to set up.
[00:46:00.140 --> 00:46:04.700]   So you're basically using-- you're basically using--
[00:46:04.700 --> 00:46:06.820]   you could either have each drive be separate.
[00:46:06.820 --> 00:46:09.140]   So you have four volumes that you could have,
[00:46:09.140 --> 00:46:13.220]   or you could use the RAID tool and make them into one huge--
[00:46:13.220 --> 00:46:15.060]   When you say the RAID tool, so are you--
[00:46:15.060 --> 00:46:17.700]   so you've installed-- you've got all this hardware installed.
[00:46:17.700 --> 00:46:19.500]   There's some kind of a controller, which is--
[00:46:19.500 --> 00:46:19.900]   No, no.
[00:46:19.900 --> 00:46:21.900]   It's basically built into the Mac.
[00:46:21.900 --> 00:46:22.260]   So you just--
[00:46:22.260 --> 00:46:23.260]   So you basically go into this--
[00:46:23.260 --> 00:46:24.100]   So you pop them in the base.
[00:46:24.100 --> 00:46:24.420]   --to the disk utility.
[00:46:24.420 --> 00:46:26.940]   There's a thing that says RAID, and you select it,
[00:46:26.940 --> 00:46:29.500]   and you say, make RAID.
[00:46:29.500 --> 00:46:30.180]   Very complex.
[00:46:30.180 --> 00:46:31.180]   Yeah, it's very complex.
[00:46:31.180 --> 00:46:36.540]   You can make a RAID drive out of old Zip100 disks.
[00:46:36.540 --> 00:46:37.820]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:46:37.820 --> 00:46:38.740]   You know, I was thinking--
[00:46:38.740 --> 00:46:41.340]   I was going to cut mine into throwing stars.
[00:46:41.340 --> 00:46:43.020]   I was thinking of a shuffle RAID.
[00:46:43.020 --> 00:46:46.660]   And you make it like a little design, and you get RAID 1.
[00:46:46.660 --> 00:46:47.660]   I bet you get up to it.
[00:46:47.660 --> 00:46:48.340]   You're serious.
[00:46:48.340 --> 00:46:53.980]   Well, the even more consumer-friendly, less power
[00:46:53.980 --> 00:46:57.700]   user-y version that I've been looking at is Buffalo.
[00:46:57.700 --> 00:46:58.900]   I think we talked about this.
[00:46:58.900 --> 00:47:01.460]   You and I talked about this off mic a couple weeks ago.
[00:47:01.460 --> 00:47:03.900]   Is Buffalo makes these things called the Terra station
[00:47:03.900 --> 00:47:04.580]   that looks pretty great?
[00:47:04.580 --> 00:47:05.620]   These are very cool, too.
[00:47:05.620 --> 00:47:06.660]   Well, I was just showing you guys.
[00:47:06.660 --> 00:47:08.500]   This just popped up in my deal news, RSS alerts.
[00:47:08.500 --> 00:47:12.980]   You can get a Buffalo Terra station, 2TB, NAS RAID,
[00:47:12.980 --> 00:47:15.260]   hard drive for 928 shipped.
[00:47:15.260 --> 00:47:16.500]   2TB.
[00:47:16.500 --> 00:47:17.020]   2TB.
[00:47:17.020 --> 00:47:17.940]   Now is that for 925?
[00:47:17.940 --> 00:47:18.940]   Now that's a RAID 5.
[00:47:18.940 --> 00:47:21.860]   Is that 2TB before after it's formatted as a RAID 5?
[00:47:21.860 --> 00:47:23.980]   I think that's before the RAID 5, right?
[00:47:23.980 --> 00:47:25.660]   Because you're going to lose-- how much do you lose?
[00:47:25.660 --> 00:47:25.660]   20%?
[00:47:25.660 --> 00:47:26.180]   20%?
[00:47:26.180 --> 00:47:27.180]   25%.
[00:47:27.180 --> 00:47:28.180]   25%.
[00:47:28.180 --> 00:47:29.900]   So what do you think of that?
[00:47:29.900 --> 00:47:30.740]   So 1.5 gigs of stuff.
[00:47:30.740 --> 00:47:32.100]   Well, here's the thing.
[00:47:32.100 --> 00:47:34.780]   You're still kind of on your own, which
[00:47:34.780 --> 00:47:36.980]   is the way I'd prefer it.
[00:47:36.980 --> 00:47:41.580]   There's not really going to be, quote, tech support for your RAID.
[00:47:41.580 --> 00:47:45.420]   But for $900 to get it off the shelf, plug it in and go.
[00:47:45.420 --> 00:47:48.260]   Would you buy at least one more extra spare drive
[00:47:48.260 --> 00:47:49.820]   to have a round in case one--
[00:47:49.820 --> 00:47:50.660]   Well, I would have to--
[00:47:50.660 --> 00:47:51.060]   How often do one of them?
[00:47:51.060 --> 00:47:52.020]   How often is one of them die?
[00:47:52.020 --> 00:47:53.020]   Well, here's the thing.
[00:47:53.020 --> 00:47:55.180]   First thing you have to do is get the Buffalo station.
[00:47:55.180 --> 00:47:56.700]   And then you have to open it up to find out
[00:47:56.700 --> 00:47:59.140]   what kind of drive is in it, right?
[00:47:59.140 --> 00:48:03.980]   So you want to then get the same brand manufacturers model
[00:48:03.980 --> 00:48:08.300]   that come close so that if one of the drives does fail,
[00:48:08.300 --> 00:48:11.420]   then you can plop it back in and make it go.
[00:48:11.420 --> 00:48:12.820]   I'd like to chime in here, guys.
[00:48:12.820 --> 00:48:15.460]   A couple of these standalone RAID solutions
[00:48:15.460 --> 00:48:17.420]   don't always work so good with the Mac.
[00:48:17.420 --> 00:48:22.740]   I tried the Mac Store, one touch, one terabyte RAID drives.
[00:48:22.740 --> 00:48:24.540]   And they will work.
[00:48:24.540 --> 00:48:27.860]   But the problem is is that you have to really baby them
[00:48:27.860 --> 00:48:29.060]   to keep them working.
[00:48:29.060 --> 00:48:32.340]   If they have this routine where they shut themselves down
[00:48:32.340 --> 00:48:34.380]   and then they move off your desktop,
[00:48:34.380 --> 00:48:35.780]   and even though they're connected,
[00:48:35.780 --> 00:48:36.940]   you can't make them work.
[00:48:36.940 --> 00:48:38.860]   And I've had tons of trouble with them.
[00:48:38.860 --> 00:48:40.820]   I've had a couple other brands where I had those problems.
[00:48:40.820 --> 00:48:42.820]   That's why I ended up going to Apple's solution.
[00:48:42.820 --> 00:48:44.700]   But anyway, you want to test all these
[00:48:44.700 --> 00:48:46.260]   before you actually hook them to your Mac.
[00:48:46.260 --> 00:48:48.940]   Because some of them, while they say they're Mac compatible,
[00:48:48.940 --> 00:48:50.500]   they're not so much.
[00:48:50.500 --> 00:48:55.300]   OK, so the biggest thing that I found with the NAS devices
[00:48:55.300 --> 00:49:01.500]   that I've used is that they're using a file system that's
[00:49:01.500 --> 00:49:02.780]   not compatible with Mac.
[00:49:02.780 --> 00:49:05.100]   So a Mac file system will actually let
[00:49:05.100 --> 00:49:07.740]   you have a slash in the file name.
[00:49:07.740 --> 00:49:11.220]   But if you push that off to the NAS,
[00:49:11.220 --> 00:49:15.540]   it won't copy it because there's a slash in it.
[00:49:15.540 --> 00:49:16.820]   Or because there's a space in it.
[00:49:16.820 --> 00:49:21.260]   Or the file name's just illegal for that particular device.
[00:49:21.260 --> 00:49:24.020]   It can be really annoying.
[00:49:24.020 --> 00:49:25.380]   Yeah.
[00:49:25.380 --> 00:49:26.940]   I mean, why should I--
[00:49:26.940 --> 00:49:28.740]   Can you reformat it?
[00:49:28.740 --> 00:49:29.580]   Sometimes you can.
[00:49:29.580 --> 00:49:32.580]   But the one that I'm specifically referring to
[00:49:32.580 --> 00:49:34.420]   can't be reformat.
[00:49:34.420 --> 00:49:36.660]   I mean, it's the file system that it is.
[00:49:36.660 --> 00:49:37.180]   OK.
[00:49:37.180 --> 00:49:38.620]   Well, we're probably running a little longer than this.
[00:49:38.620 --> 00:49:40.940]   I want to toss in one more solution for this.
[00:49:40.940 --> 00:49:43.020]   I got a great email from a guy named
[00:49:43.020 --> 00:49:45.940]   Greg Keene who has a site called techdigs.net.
[00:49:45.940 --> 00:49:48.420]   And well, I'll let the cat out of the bag.
[00:49:48.420 --> 00:49:50.900]   I'm asking Greg to basically write this up as a 43 folders
[00:49:50.900 --> 00:49:52.260]   post because this was pretty great.
[00:49:52.260 --> 00:49:54.500]   And he told me a little bit about how he set up his two
[00:49:54.500 --> 00:49:55.420]   terabyte drive.
[00:49:55.420 --> 00:49:57.620]   And one of the best tricks I got for him is something I
[00:49:57.620 --> 00:49:58.860]   completely forgot about.
[00:49:58.860 --> 00:50:01.580]   And this is not a BL end-all solution.
[00:50:01.580 --> 00:50:06.180]   But I completely forgot about S3, the Amazon storage thing.
[00:50:06.180 --> 00:50:08.660]   And so I started playing around today with Jungle Disc.
[00:50:08.660 --> 00:50:10.900]   Have you guys missed around much with Jungle Disc?
[00:50:10.900 --> 00:50:11.460]   It's pretty great.
[00:50:11.460 --> 00:50:14.620]   I mean, Jungle Disc, basically, you run this app.
[00:50:14.620 --> 00:50:19.660]   And it basically allows you to mount your S3 storage.
[00:50:19.660 --> 00:50:21.620]   So S3 is this Amazon super cheap.
[00:50:21.620 --> 00:50:23.140]   Like, what does it end up costing?
[00:50:23.140 --> 00:50:24.340]   It's crazy cheap.
[00:50:24.340 --> 00:50:25.780]   It ends up being--
[00:50:25.780 --> 00:50:27.180]   It's like $30.
[00:50:27.180 --> 00:50:31.180]   Greg's saying here that he's doing 200 gigs of storage
[00:50:31.180 --> 00:50:33.220]   a month for $20.
[00:50:33.220 --> 00:50:34.540]   Oh, this is in his online storage.
[00:50:34.540 --> 00:50:35.020]   That's right.
[00:50:35.020 --> 00:50:36.340]   It's very, very inexpensive.
[00:50:36.340 --> 00:50:38.100]   And so if you're doing very large amounts--
[00:50:38.100 --> 00:50:40.420]   but here's the cool part is it works a lot like .mac.
[00:50:40.420 --> 00:50:41.500]   Except on a much larger scale.
[00:50:41.500 --> 00:50:43.980]   So you throw a bunch of stuff into this web dev server.
[00:50:43.980 --> 00:50:45.940]   And then as it's able to, it does the syncing
[00:50:45.940 --> 00:50:46.980]   in the background.
[00:50:46.980 --> 00:50:48.900]   And then once you've got one big upload,
[00:50:48.900 --> 00:50:51.060]   you can use our sync or corona sync or whatever
[00:50:51.060 --> 00:50:52.380]   to automate the--
[00:50:52.380 --> 00:50:53.340]   just doing the diffs.
[00:50:53.340 --> 00:50:56.620]   The issue with this is going to be with the quote office
[00:50:56.620 --> 00:50:58.420]   because you have a limited bandwidth.
[00:50:58.420 --> 00:51:01.180]   So I think if you're the home office by yourself,
[00:51:01.180 --> 00:51:05.420]   perfect solution because you're that 150k DSL--
[00:51:05.420 --> 00:51:08.300]   actually, it's only 40k a second up.
[00:51:08.300 --> 00:51:09.980]   Wouldn't get saturated.
[00:51:09.980 --> 00:51:11.780]   But if you had more than one machine,
[00:51:11.780 --> 00:51:13.140]   you're going to saturate your line.
[00:51:13.140 --> 00:51:14.900]   And again, it's one of those things
[00:51:14.900 --> 00:51:16.660]   where any of these things, the first time
[00:51:16.660 --> 00:51:18.140]   is going to be the most painful as it gets
[00:51:18.140 --> 00:51:19.300]   the first version of it up.
[00:51:19.300 --> 00:51:21.460]   And there's weird limitations in bugs like it.
[00:51:21.460 --> 00:51:24.100]   One except plus signs and file names, things like that.
[00:51:24.100 --> 00:51:27.380]   Same thing with any other NAS.
[00:51:27.380 --> 00:51:28.060]   Really?
[00:51:28.060 --> 00:51:29.180]   That's good to know.
[00:51:29.180 --> 00:51:30.580]   And I have found--
[00:51:30.580 --> 00:51:32.060]   I don't know if it's just me and my bad luck,
[00:51:32.060 --> 00:51:34.260]   but I found Jungle Disc a little bit crashy.
[00:51:34.260 --> 00:51:36.140]   But it's definitely worth taking a look at.
[00:51:36.140 --> 00:51:37.700]   If you've got--
[00:51:37.700 --> 00:51:40.500]   if you-- let's be honest, I mean, the .max storage
[00:51:40.500 --> 00:51:42.220]   is probably not the most economical solution
[00:51:42.220 --> 00:51:44.860]   for a lot of people given what you really get out of it.
[00:51:44.860 --> 00:51:46.620]   If you've got just stuff that you need to like it--
[00:51:46.620 --> 00:51:48.180]   whether it's even your iTunes library,
[00:51:48.180 --> 00:51:50.060]   this seems like a pretty economical way
[00:51:50.060 --> 00:51:51.060]   to keep it back up.
[00:51:51.060 --> 00:51:53.860]   Well, .max is awesome for contacts, phone numbers, email
[00:51:53.860 --> 00:51:54.780]   addresses, syncing.
[00:51:54.780 --> 00:51:57.900]   You know the basic syncing stuff.
[00:51:57.900 --> 00:52:00.020]   But not so much for the other stuff.
[00:52:00.020 --> 00:52:01.340]   Hey, but you get to use backup.
[00:52:01.340 --> 00:52:01.980]   How nice is that?
[00:52:01.980 --> 00:52:02.740]   Backup.app.
[00:52:02.740 --> 00:52:04.180]   But keeps getting better backup.
[00:52:04.180 --> 00:52:04.980]   It does.
[00:52:04.980 --> 00:52:07.420]   It just sucks louder and louder.
[00:52:07.420 --> 00:52:10.140]   Which brings us to our recommendations for the week.
[00:52:10.140 --> 00:52:12.460]   Now, did we-- Scott, did we--
[00:52:12.460 --> 00:52:14.340]   I don't think we really talked too much about what
[00:52:14.340 --> 00:52:15.260]   happened last week.
[00:52:15.260 --> 00:52:18.700]   Scott, did you actually listen to the show last week?
[00:52:18.700 --> 00:52:21.060]   I started listening to it, but I had trouble.
[00:52:21.060 --> 00:52:23.340]   Yeah.
[00:52:23.340 --> 00:52:27.580]   So just for those listening, because there were some posts
[00:52:27.580 --> 00:52:29.940]   that it was really bad and everything else.
[00:52:29.940 --> 00:52:33.300]   It was actually a good show when we recorded it.
[00:52:33.300 --> 00:52:34.980]   What happened is, is that-- well, actually,
[00:52:34.980 --> 00:52:37.140]   I don't have a solid answer of exactly what happened,
[00:52:37.140 --> 00:52:40.460]   but about a couple minutes into the show,
[00:52:40.460 --> 00:52:43.300]   and then near the end of the show.
[00:52:43.300 --> 00:52:46.740]   And the only thing that changed about the way
[00:52:46.740 --> 00:52:50.580]   to record stuff is that I was recording via Skype.
[00:52:50.580 --> 00:52:52.820]   And then there's this whole process
[00:52:52.820 --> 00:52:55.700]   when you record via Skype where you are doing what we call
[00:52:55.700 --> 00:53:00.100]   a mix minus, where I'm feeding the audio back to--
[00:53:00.100 --> 00:53:02.660]   my audio back to the people listening,
[00:53:02.660 --> 00:53:06.020]   which in this case was Scott and Chris Breen.
[00:53:06.020 --> 00:53:08.180]   And then I'm bringing-- but I'm still feeding the audio,
[00:53:08.180 --> 00:53:10.940]   but another round of audio into the mixer.
[00:53:10.940 --> 00:53:15.780]   And then I was recording via USB from the mixer to a G5.
[00:53:15.780 --> 00:53:17.180]   And that's--
[00:53:17.180 --> 00:53:18.180]   You know, it also--
[00:53:18.180 --> 00:53:19.660]   --thr the river and through the woods.
[00:53:19.660 --> 00:53:21.020]   Well, it all works.
[00:53:21.020 --> 00:53:22.860]   It's very convoluted.
[00:53:22.860 --> 00:53:24.420]   It's kind of Rube Goldberg.
[00:53:24.420 --> 00:53:25.100]   Yeah.
[00:53:25.100 --> 00:53:29.060]   So anyway, something happened, and I still haven't figured out
[00:53:29.060 --> 00:53:31.260]   exactly what it was, whether it was soundtrack
[00:53:31.260 --> 00:53:32.940]   or whether it was the mixer.
[00:53:32.940 --> 00:53:34.540]   Because the mixer is kind of the software mixer.
[00:53:34.540 --> 00:53:36.540]   It's just a little oleces, multi-mix.
[00:53:36.540 --> 00:53:39.260]   And I had never set up the mix that way before.
[00:53:39.260 --> 00:53:43.260]   It was kind of a me thinking that was being smart.
[00:53:43.260 --> 00:53:45.820]   And literally, it just sounds like-- it was just garbled.
[00:53:45.820 --> 00:53:47.060]   It wasn't like one side or the other.
[00:53:47.060 --> 00:53:51.140]   Both my-- oh, and the other thing I did-- oh, one more thing--
[00:53:51.140 --> 00:53:53.780]   is I mixed it so that the Skype was on one side
[00:53:53.780 --> 00:53:56.780]   and I was on the-- so Skype was left and I was right.
[00:53:56.780 --> 00:53:58.260]   So it was the stereo of the two.
[00:53:58.260 --> 00:54:01.060]   And somewhere along this path, it just ripped up.
[00:54:01.060 --> 00:54:04.460]   I mean, it just-- it was--
[00:54:04.460 --> 00:54:05.460]   people wouldn't--
[00:54:05.460 --> 00:54:06.220]   It wasn't good.
[00:54:06.220 --> 00:54:06.900]   It would hurt you.
[00:54:06.900 --> 00:54:08.540]   It probably caused you to hurt other people.
[00:54:08.540 --> 00:54:09.900]   You know, it was really bad.
[00:54:09.900 --> 00:54:11.580]   And the scary thing, as I was saying before the show, Alex,
[00:54:11.580 --> 00:54:13.180]   is we're the experts in this field.
[00:54:13.180 --> 00:54:14.060]   Yeah, I know.
[00:54:14.060 --> 00:54:15.060]   So--
[00:54:15.060 --> 00:54:16.460]   Why are you bringing all this up again?
[00:54:16.460 --> 00:54:18.260]   It feels like it's very painful for you.
[00:54:18.260 --> 00:54:22.060]   It was-- it was horrible.
[00:54:22.060 --> 00:54:23.260]   Got to your safe place.
[00:54:23.260 --> 00:54:24.020]   I am going to go.
[00:54:24.020 --> 00:54:25.380]   OK, OK, OK.
[00:54:25.380 --> 00:54:25.700]   OK, OK.
[00:54:25.700 --> 00:54:27.940]   Anyway, so it took a little while to get out.
[00:54:27.940 --> 00:54:30.060]   And we got it up, and then everyone complained about it.
[00:54:30.060 --> 00:54:31.580]   And then I felt like maybe I shouldn't have put it up.
[00:54:31.580 --> 00:54:35.740]   But the point is, is that I'm not sure--
[00:54:35.740 --> 00:54:38.900]   I don't think at the end we got to the recommendations.
[00:54:38.900 --> 00:54:40.980]   I think I cut it off before we got to the recommendations.
[00:54:40.980 --> 00:54:41.420]   And so--
[00:54:41.420 --> 00:54:43.860]   And I have no idea what my recommendation was last week.
[00:54:43.860 --> 00:54:45.060]   But I have a new one this week.
[00:54:45.060 --> 00:54:46.900]   All right, well, you think your recommendation is probably
[00:54:46.900 --> 00:54:48.020]   done with Skype.
[00:54:48.020 --> 00:54:49.860]   My recommendation is not to use Skype.
[00:54:49.860 --> 00:54:52.820]   My recommendation is that if you're doing podcasts--
[00:54:52.820 --> 00:54:54.260]   yeah, don't do that again.
[00:54:54.260 --> 00:54:56.180]   So that's all I have to say about that.
[00:54:56.180 --> 00:54:58.380]   We're not doing Skype this time.
[00:54:58.380 --> 00:55:02.060]   But one thing I did use before we moved off to that--
[00:55:02.060 --> 00:55:06.020]   this morning we did a test with talk shoe.
[00:55:06.020 --> 00:55:07.500]   That's what Leo's doing at night.
[00:55:07.500 --> 00:55:09.700]   At night, Amber and Leo have been using talk shoe.
[00:55:09.700 --> 00:55:11.340]   Unbelievably cool.
[00:55:11.340 --> 00:55:11.780]   Really?
[00:55:11.780 --> 00:55:13.580]   Now, I know that it's hard for--
[00:55:13.580 --> 00:55:17.940]   I think they're having trouble because they have so many people.
[00:55:17.940 --> 00:55:19.620]   You know what they need to do, Alex?
[00:55:19.620 --> 00:55:21.020]   They need to build capacity.
[00:55:21.020 --> 00:55:22.060]   They do need to build capacity.
[00:55:22.060 --> 00:55:23.500]   So they can scale across the enterprise.
[00:55:23.500 --> 00:55:23.780]   Yes, exactly.
[00:55:23.780 --> 00:55:25.220]   Thank you.
[00:55:25.220 --> 00:55:25.700]   Great.
[00:55:25.700 --> 00:55:26.700]   You may take two drinks.
[00:55:26.700 --> 00:55:28.700]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:55:28.700 --> 00:55:30.780]   No, but that's-- I mean, they get to hurt and pretty bad when
[00:55:30.780 --> 00:55:31.940]   they get 50, 60--
[00:55:31.940 --> 00:55:33.420]   Yeah, and I only had 10.
[00:55:33.420 --> 00:55:35.300]   I had 10 or 12 people from the Pixel Core.
[00:55:35.300 --> 00:55:36.700]   We were doing a Pixel Core internal one.
[00:55:36.700 --> 00:55:37.620]   What all does it do?
[00:55:37.620 --> 00:55:38.380]   It's got chat.
[00:55:38.380 --> 00:55:39.740]   I didn't understand what it did either.
[00:55:39.740 --> 00:55:41.460]   And to be honest with you, I didn't understand it
[00:55:41.460 --> 00:55:43.340]   until about five minutes before we went on.
[00:55:43.340 --> 00:55:46.020]   Because I had this picture of what talk shoe did.
[00:55:46.020 --> 00:55:47.900]   And I kind of went up and I set up something.
[00:55:47.900 --> 00:55:49.220]   And then I kind of moved around.
[00:55:49.220 --> 00:55:50.900]   And I kind of-- you know, it was one of those things.
[00:55:50.900 --> 00:55:53.500]   And I finally figured out all it's doing is a telephone.
[00:55:53.500 --> 00:55:56.180]   It's all it is, is an automated telephone switching
[00:55:56.180 --> 00:55:56.680]   system.
[00:55:56.680 --> 00:55:58.540]   So basically, it's like a conference call.
[00:55:58.540 --> 00:56:00.540]   Everyone's calling the same number.
[00:56:00.540 --> 00:56:03.100]   The only difference is, is that me as the user--
[00:56:03.100 --> 00:56:06.540]   this is what makes them different-- is that me as the host
[00:56:06.540 --> 00:56:09.340]   can turn their phone on and off as far as whether they're
[00:56:09.340 --> 00:56:10.700]   able to speak or not.
[00:56:10.700 --> 00:56:13.220]   So I have-- you have 30 people--
[00:56:13.220 --> 00:56:14.540]   Like an investor call.
[00:56:14.540 --> 00:56:16.500]   Yeah, 30 people can-- yeah, exactly.
[00:56:16.500 --> 00:56:17.860]   Except they're not-- yeah, anyway.
[00:56:17.860 --> 00:56:18.700]   Except they have no one.
[00:56:18.700 --> 00:56:19.700]   Same concept, right?
[00:56:19.700 --> 00:56:19.900]   Same concept.
[00:56:19.900 --> 00:56:21.100]   It's mostly people are listening.
[00:56:21.100 --> 00:56:22.980]   And then if you choose two, you can point to them.
[00:56:22.980 --> 00:56:23.660]   I can point to them.
[00:56:23.660 --> 00:56:24.660]   And they can talk.
[00:56:24.660 --> 00:56:25.780]   And the one thing that's interesting is,
[00:56:25.780 --> 00:56:27.420]   is that everyone-- the only way to talk,
[00:56:27.420 --> 00:56:29.660]   I thought that you could do it somehow online.
[00:56:29.660 --> 00:56:31.580]   You can do it, but you have to call in.
[00:56:31.580 --> 00:56:33.820]   You can use Skype if you want.
[00:56:33.820 --> 00:56:36.860]   Or anything that any kind of VoIP will work.
[00:56:36.860 --> 00:56:38.940]   But you call in, and that's how you're going to talk.
[00:56:38.940 --> 00:56:40.860]   Now, you can listen to a stream.
[00:56:40.860 --> 00:56:42.540]   If you don't have a phone, you can just
[00:56:42.540 --> 00:56:44.740]   listen to the live stream.
[00:56:44.740 --> 00:56:47.660]   But if you have a phone, you can actually interact.
[00:56:47.660 --> 00:56:50.100]   And I can see-- when you're both on the computer
[00:56:50.100 --> 00:56:52.980]   and on the phone, I can see you--
[00:56:52.980 --> 00:56:55.940]   like you can request, you can kind of raise your hand.
[00:56:55.940 --> 00:56:59.300]   And you can even put in the chat window what you want to say.
[00:56:59.300 --> 00:57:01.500]   And then I can call on you like a radio show.
[00:57:01.500 --> 00:57:02.140]   Can you have a screener?
[00:57:02.140 --> 00:57:04.060]   Can you have somebody who's doing that for you?
[00:57:04.060 --> 00:57:04.460]   I could.
[00:57:04.460 --> 00:57:06.100]   What I could do is not be the host.
[00:57:06.100 --> 00:57:08.420]   I could have someone else be the host and me just talking
[00:57:08.420 --> 00:57:09.260]   into it.
[00:57:09.260 --> 00:57:09.780]   Wow.
[00:57:09.780 --> 00:57:11.740]   Because you can have up to like four or five people
[00:57:11.740 --> 00:57:12.580]   on at the same time.
[00:57:12.580 --> 00:57:14.580]   Like we were turning people on.
[00:57:14.580 --> 00:57:16.300]   It was remarkably smooth.
[00:57:16.300 --> 00:57:18.660]   At first, I was just like, I could not get my head around it.
[00:57:18.660 --> 00:57:21.020]   And then once I started using it, I think we're going to use it.
[00:57:21.020 --> 00:57:22.300]   And one of the things I'm thinking of doing--
[00:57:22.300 --> 00:57:23.900]   and I don't know whether we're going to use talk shoe
[00:57:23.900 --> 00:57:27.340]   or whether we're going to use some other stuff--
[00:57:27.340 --> 00:57:29.100]   We're discussing that blog thing--
[00:57:29.100 --> 00:57:30.380]   talk thing or whatever.
[00:57:30.380 --> 00:57:32.380]   But we're going to use something where I think
[00:57:32.380 --> 00:57:35.980]   that it was so fun to do it this morning with the Pixelcore
[00:57:35.980 --> 00:57:39.300]   that I really think we had to do once a month or so,
[00:57:39.300 --> 00:57:42.540]   or at least when we get-- we'll do at least a test
[00:57:42.540 --> 00:57:43.580]   in the upcoming month.
[00:57:43.580 --> 00:57:45.300]   Scott can call in with his iPhone.
[00:57:45.300 --> 00:57:45.820]   Yeah.
[00:57:45.820 --> 00:57:48.540]   I was going to say, can you connect to that with an iPhone?
[00:57:48.540 --> 00:57:50.700]   You know, I bet you you can.
[00:57:50.700 --> 00:57:51.980]   Is that your pick?
[00:57:51.980 --> 00:57:53.500]   No, it's not my pick.
[00:57:53.500 --> 00:57:55.500]   So we spent all this time, and that wasn't your pick?
[00:57:55.500 --> 00:57:56.140]   It's not a Mac.
[00:57:56.140 --> 00:57:56.700]   It's not Mac.
[00:57:56.700 --> 00:57:57.540]   It's just online.
[00:57:57.540 --> 00:57:58.060]   OK.
[00:57:58.060 --> 00:57:59.540]   But what is your pick, Alex?
[00:57:59.540 --> 00:58:02.820]   My pick is this one that I started talking about last week,
[00:58:02.820 --> 00:58:06.340]   but I'm going to talk about this week because we're using it
[00:58:06.340 --> 00:58:07.340]   heavily in the office.
[00:58:07.340 --> 00:58:09.140]   It's probably the most used application
[00:58:09.140 --> 00:58:10.100]   that we're using right now.
[00:58:10.100 --> 00:58:13.980]   And it's a little self-serving because we wrote it.
[00:58:13.980 --> 00:58:14.940]   I didn't write it.
[00:58:14.940 --> 00:58:20.540]   These guys wrote it in Finland and in Chicago, Ben Siversen
[00:58:20.540 --> 00:58:23.140]   and Polly-- and I can't say Polly's name very smoothly,
[00:58:23.140 --> 00:58:23.780]   so I won't try.
[00:58:23.780 --> 00:58:25.500]   But it's called Conduit.
[00:58:25.500 --> 00:58:28.540]   And what it is, is it's basically like a little mini shake.
[00:58:28.540 --> 00:58:30.740]   It's like, shake is a super high-end compositor,
[00:58:30.740 --> 00:58:32.220]   and it doesn't do everything that shake does.
[00:58:32.220 --> 00:58:34.540]   But what it does do is the nodal compositor, which
[00:58:34.540 --> 00:58:36.500]   lets you do high-end visual effects.
[00:58:36.500 --> 00:58:38.140]   So you can do all that stuff inside of final--
[00:58:38.140 --> 00:58:39.700]   Is this the Chrome key kind of stuff?
[00:58:39.700 --> 00:58:40.460]   Like the green screen?
[00:58:40.460 --> 00:58:42.540]   It's for pulling the green screens and Mac break specifically.
[00:58:42.540 --> 00:58:43.620]   And you're going to see some of that when
[00:58:43.620 --> 00:58:45.700]   we do some of the new row-to-tenity-p's
[00:58:45.700 --> 00:58:48.420]   that shows you behind the scenes of the software end of things.
[00:58:48.420 --> 00:58:49.540]   You're going to see how that works.
[00:58:49.540 --> 00:58:53.820]   But it is a-- to give you an idea,
[00:58:53.820 --> 00:58:57.700]   the shake renders were taking us about eight hours per camera
[00:58:57.700 --> 00:59:00.140]   to render.
[00:59:00.140 --> 00:59:02.860]   So it only takes 15 or 20 minutes to set up the key,
[00:59:02.860 --> 00:59:06.460]   but it takes eight hours-- because these are big files.
[00:59:06.460 --> 00:59:07.620]   Now we don't even bother.
[00:59:07.620 --> 00:59:09.180]   We just edit the whole thing in green screen.
[00:59:09.180 --> 00:59:13.020]   We add the plug into it, and it adds 20 minutes over what
[00:59:13.020 --> 00:59:14.580]   it wouldn't render without any plug-in.
[00:59:14.580 --> 00:59:16.900]   So it's about an hour render for the whole GPU.
[00:59:16.900 --> 00:59:20.900]   Yeah, because it's all just using the GPU to do the rendering.
[00:59:20.900 --> 00:59:25.660]   And so anyway, for those out there using Final Cut Pro Studio,
[00:59:25.660 --> 00:59:26.940]   that's my pick of the week.
[00:59:26.940 --> 00:59:30.740]   This is an interesting thing, because it won't work on a MacBook.
[00:59:30.740 --> 00:59:33.180]   You have to have a real video card in your Mac.
[00:59:33.180 --> 00:59:34.020]   It will work.
[00:59:34.020 --> 00:59:35.340]   It just won't work fast.
[00:59:35.340 --> 00:59:36.180]   It won't work fast.
[00:59:36.180 --> 00:59:36.860]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:59:36.860 --> 00:59:38.820]   Is this something people can download?
[00:59:38.820 --> 00:59:41.300]   They can download a demo at dvgarage.com.
[00:59:41.300 --> 00:59:43.420]   And there's tons of tutorials.
[00:59:43.420 --> 00:59:45.180]   And even if you don't like this kind of stuff,
[00:59:45.180 --> 00:59:47.300]   you can watch the movies and you can see cool stuff.
[00:59:47.300 --> 00:59:48.740]   It's one of those things that--
[00:59:48.740 --> 00:59:49.980]   there's lots of eye candy up there.
[00:59:49.980 --> 00:59:52.780]   And so you can see how graphics get done and all that.
[00:59:52.780 --> 00:59:54.140]   Fun stuff.
[00:59:54.140 --> 00:59:57.540]   So anyway, but that's a very--
[00:59:57.540 --> 00:59:58.980]   it's a little fun application.
[00:59:58.980 --> 00:59:59.980]   How's Tasty?
[00:59:59.980 --> 01:00:01.620]   Merlin.
[01:00:01.620 --> 01:00:05.740]   My application, my Mac pick, is called Sleepless.
[01:00:05.740 --> 01:00:11.820]   And when I got my MacBook Pro, I retired my 118-pound 17-inch
[01:00:11.820 --> 01:00:13.580]   G4.
[01:00:13.580 --> 01:00:14.500]   Boy, that thing was heavy.
[01:00:14.500 --> 01:00:16.460]   It's heavy and it's big.
[01:00:16.460 --> 01:00:17.820]   And so right now, I basically--
[01:00:17.820 --> 01:00:19.020]   I mentioned this before, but I'm just
[01:00:19.020 --> 01:00:20.340]   going to use it as a media server.
[01:00:20.340 --> 01:00:25.100]   So I just set it by the TV and let it basically run my iTunes
[01:00:25.100 --> 01:00:27.780]   movies to the TV and all that kind of stuff.
[01:00:27.780 --> 01:00:30.580]   And slowly but surely I'm getting that kind of set up.
[01:00:30.580 --> 01:00:34.100]   I'm moving out of the 1970s in my multimedia setup.
[01:00:34.100 --> 01:00:36.260]   But of course, the problem is if you don't
[01:00:36.260 --> 01:00:39.220]   want it to take up a huge vertical footprint--
[01:00:39.220 --> 01:00:40.140]   is that a phrase?
[01:00:40.140 --> 01:00:43.860]   By leaving the lid up, it's nice to be able to run it lid closed.
[01:00:43.860 --> 01:00:46.020]   And I've been trying three or four different applications
[01:00:46.020 --> 01:00:49.180]   to help me run it with the lid closed.
[01:00:49.180 --> 01:00:51.660]   And the best one I've found so far is called Sleepless.
[01:00:51.660 --> 01:00:55.620]   So if you've got an old power book,
[01:00:55.620 --> 01:00:57.980]   supposedly you need to be very careful doing this with iBooks
[01:00:57.980 --> 01:00:59.580]   because of heat issues, although I
[01:00:59.580 --> 01:01:02.060]   could imagine being a problem with lots of different ones.
[01:01:02.060 --> 01:01:03.900]   But I haven't had any problems yet.
[01:01:03.900 --> 01:01:07.100]   You would get Sleepless 950 shareware.
[01:01:07.100 --> 01:01:10.220]   It's available at alxsoft.com.
[01:01:10.220 --> 01:01:12.220]   And you just throw it on there and you say, you know what?
[01:01:12.220 --> 01:01:13.020]   Don't let this sleep.
[01:01:13.020 --> 01:01:15.060]   It gives you a little bit of choices.
[01:01:15.060 --> 01:01:16.860]   You can do things like say, you know,
[01:01:16.860 --> 01:01:19.780]   you don't want just the monitor to sleep.
[01:01:19.780 --> 01:01:20.980]   You know, leave the system up.
[01:01:20.980 --> 01:01:22.420]   There's some variability to it.
[01:01:22.420 --> 01:01:23.380]   But it's been working great.
[01:01:23.380 --> 01:01:26.100]   And then I can just run the functionality
[01:01:26.100 --> 01:01:29.220]   over desktop remote and remote desktop.
[01:01:29.220 --> 01:01:30.620]   That's not remote desktop.
[01:01:30.620 --> 01:01:31.700]   And it works like a champ.
[01:01:31.700 --> 01:01:33.260]   I love remote desktop.
[01:01:33.260 --> 01:01:34.820]   Remote desktop is like magic to me.
[01:01:34.820 --> 01:01:35.260]   Oh my god.
[01:01:35.260 --> 01:01:36.460]   Especially when you shrink it and make it
[01:01:36.460 --> 01:01:37.420]   to one tiny little window.
[01:01:37.420 --> 01:01:41.260]   And can I just say Alex two words?
[01:01:41.260 --> 01:01:42.140]   Logan's fine.
[01:01:42.140 --> 01:01:44.060]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:01:44.060 --> 01:01:46.380]   Just to give it a little thing about remote desktop,
[01:01:46.380 --> 01:01:48.700]   just to take us off the rails here for just a second,
[01:01:48.700 --> 01:01:51.660]   is that I needed files on one of the computers in the office
[01:01:51.660 --> 01:01:52.820]   while I was in India.
[01:01:52.820 --> 01:01:54.300]   So I'm sitting in Mumbai.
[01:01:54.300 --> 01:01:55.340]   And I need these files.
[01:01:55.340 --> 01:01:57.980]   And there was something very surreal about using remote
[01:01:57.980 --> 01:02:01.460]   desktop to access my laptop in the office
[01:02:01.460 --> 01:02:07.220]   to FTP files from another computer up to--
[01:02:07.220 --> 01:02:08.620]   you know, so I was like linking into the office.
[01:02:08.620 --> 01:02:10.980]   That's like playing Apple 2E games on a window.
[01:02:10.980 --> 01:02:12.580]   Dude, it was like--
[01:02:12.580 --> 01:02:14.740]   you know, and it was this point where you don't really
[01:02:14.740 --> 01:02:15.140]   think about it.
[01:02:15.140 --> 01:02:16.620]   You go, oh, I got Apple remote desktop.
[01:02:16.620 --> 01:02:18.260]   And I'm sitting in this hotel room in Mumbai,
[01:02:18.260 --> 01:02:20.260]   just sitting there just moving my computer around
[01:02:20.260 --> 01:02:22.700]   and opening and transmit and moving stuff--
[01:02:22.700 --> 01:02:25.700]   moving files from one of the other computers.
[01:02:25.700 --> 01:02:29.020]   And then there was this point where I really realized
[01:02:29.020 --> 01:02:29.860]   what I was doing.
[01:02:29.860 --> 01:02:31.420]   I was like, this is like--
[01:02:31.420 --> 01:02:33.820]   it was just the surreal connection of--
[01:02:33.820 --> 01:02:35.180]   It completely feels like that.
[01:02:35.180 --> 01:02:39.100]   And especially because when you're watching it on TV,
[01:02:39.100 --> 01:02:40.540]   in the case of the way I'm using it,
[01:02:40.540 --> 01:02:42.220]   it's like we're sitting there watching 30 Rock.
[01:02:42.220 --> 01:02:45.060]   And I'm able to change or battle-start a lot again,
[01:02:45.060 --> 01:02:47.140]   say, OK, we'll go to the next movie.
[01:02:47.140 --> 01:02:49.540]   And it feels really weird to see--
[01:02:49.540 --> 01:02:51.580]   like you're working on your Mac and then across the room
[01:02:51.580 --> 01:02:53.620]   on a screen, you're watching the same thing.
[01:02:53.620 --> 01:02:55.700]   And one of the things we've been trying to do
[01:02:55.700 --> 01:02:57.540]   is not have to have a lot of people when we want to shoot
[01:02:57.540 --> 01:02:58.140]   shows.
[01:02:58.140 --> 01:03:00.260]   And so I'm working on this new Photoshop show.
[01:03:00.260 --> 01:03:02.700]   And we wanted to set it up so that no one had to be here
[01:03:02.700 --> 01:03:03.340]   other than me.
[01:03:03.340 --> 01:03:05.260]   And so we have the 950 literally sitting out there
[01:03:05.260 --> 01:03:07.500]   with the cable running back to the computer in the back
[01:03:07.500 --> 01:03:08.820]   where the raids are.
[01:03:08.820 --> 01:03:12.260]   And I'm using the remote desktop to control the capture
[01:03:12.260 --> 01:03:14.780]   station so I can see myself in the capture stage
[01:03:14.780 --> 01:03:17.020]   and I hit OK, record.
[01:03:17.020 --> 01:03:18.740]   And then I close that window and then I start--
[01:03:18.740 --> 01:03:20.260]   I do my show.
[01:03:20.260 --> 01:03:22.300]   But it's like, it's totally--
[01:03:22.300 --> 01:03:25.100]   I'm doing my own show by myself.
[01:03:25.100 --> 01:03:27.040]   And I think that we're actually using
[01:03:27.040 --> 01:03:29.060]   Chicken on the VNC, which is pretty much the same thing,
[01:03:29.060 --> 01:03:30.820]   for that specific one, because Ben said it all.
[01:03:30.820 --> 01:03:34.340]   Guys, I have drool coming out of my mouth right now.
[01:03:34.340 --> 01:03:34.900]   All right.
[01:03:34.900 --> 01:03:37.460]   There's several candidates in this space just quickly.
[01:03:37.460 --> 01:03:39.260]   There's Chicken on the VNC.
[01:03:39.260 --> 01:03:42.620]   There's Remote Desktop.
[01:03:42.620 --> 01:03:47.540]   And I think Devon Technologies has a new one.
[01:03:47.540 --> 01:03:49.260]   It's like a real stripped down version.
[01:03:49.260 --> 01:03:50.140]   Well, it's really worth it.
[01:03:50.140 --> 01:03:53.060]   It turns out that Apple Remote Desktop is nothing more
[01:03:53.060 --> 01:03:54.300]   than VNC.
[01:03:54.300 --> 01:03:55.260]   Right.
[01:03:55.260 --> 01:03:55.780]   It's just--
[01:03:55.780 --> 01:03:56.060]   Well done.
[01:03:56.060 --> 01:03:57.020]   They just wrapped it up.
[01:03:57.020 --> 01:03:58.860]   With little shiny rounded corners.
[01:03:58.860 --> 01:04:00.700]   Scott would like to tell us what his favorite is.
[01:04:00.700 --> 01:04:02.700]   And I bet you has nothing to do with Remote Desktop.
[01:04:02.700 --> 01:04:04.340]   Well, I'm so glad you asked Alex.
[01:04:04.340 --> 01:04:06.860]   And you're absolutely right as usual.
[01:04:06.860 --> 01:04:10.100]   Actually, my pick is TechTool Pro.
[01:04:10.100 --> 01:04:11.940]   I am so impressed with this program.
[01:04:11.940 --> 01:04:12.620]   It's a great app.
[01:04:12.620 --> 01:04:15.980]   I got it-- like everybody does, I got the free version
[01:04:15.980 --> 01:04:16.980]   with my AppleCare.
[01:04:16.980 --> 01:04:18.700]   And we all love AppleCare.
[01:04:18.700 --> 01:04:20.900]   And I decided to pay $25.
[01:04:20.900 --> 01:04:21.780]   They sent me a coupon.
[01:04:21.780 --> 01:04:23.420]   I said, if you want to upgrade to the real deal,
[01:04:23.420 --> 01:04:24.460]   it's $25.
[01:04:24.460 --> 01:04:29.180]   I waited for the 4.5.2, which is the Intel compatible version.
[01:04:29.180 --> 01:04:29.780]   I got it.
[01:04:29.780 --> 01:04:31.180]   And oh, man.
[01:04:31.180 --> 01:04:34.380]   It fixed things on my 15-inch MacBook Pro
[01:04:34.380 --> 01:04:36.620]   that I had not been able to fix forever.
[01:04:36.620 --> 01:04:40.140]   And I got the traditional answer from the air quote,
[01:04:40.140 --> 01:04:44.260]   "geniuses" that I was supposed to reinstall my OS every time
[01:04:44.260 --> 01:04:45.180]   I would have a problem.
[01:04:45.180 --> 01:04:46.620]   And this thing just went in there--
[01:04:46.620 --> 01:04:49.340]   That sounds like Windows type advice, Scott, doesn't it?
[01:04:49.340 --> 01:04:50.420]   Yeah.
[01:04:50.420 --> 01:04:52.500]   They hired those guys and put them at the Genius bar.
[01:04:52.500 --> 01:04:55.460]   Anyway, I got really good results.
[01:04:55.460 --> 01:04:56.660]   This thing is brilliant.
[01:04:56.660 --> 01:04:59.060]   And it's the only program I've ever
[01:04:59.060 --> 01:05:03.140]   found that will safely and correctly
[01:05:03.140 --> 01:05:06.780]   do disk optimization on my big disks.
[01:05:06.780 --> 01:05:07.660]   So I like that.
[01:05:07.660 --> 01:05:10.460]   And just for real fun, I don't need this
[01:05:10.460 --> 01:05:12.300]   because I already have the application.
[01:05:12.300 --> 01:05:15.660]   But if I didn't and I had $229 to spend,
[01:05:15.660 --> 01:05:18.060]   they have a cool thing called TechTool Protege, which
[01:05:18.060 --> 01:05:21.860]   is a USB drive that you can actually boot your Mac from.
[01:05:21.860 --> 01:05:24.820]   And oh, if you're like one of those troubleshooting people
[01:05:24.820 --> 01:05:27.700]   or something, you just want to be the fix it guy that walks
[01:05:27.700 --> 01:05:29.540]   around and helps everybody fix their Mac.
[01:05:29.540 --> 01:05:34.580]   This little keychain-sized USB drive that has TechTool Pro
[01:05:34.580 --> 01:05:36.140]   on it is pretty sweet.
[01:05:36.140 --> 01:05:36.580]   I actually--
[01:05:36.580 --> 01:05:38.980]   Anyway, that's available from micromat.com.
[01:05:38.980 --> 01:05:41.940]   I'm actually thinking of getting that just for traveling
[01:05:41.940 --> 01:05:43.860]   because a lot of times, when I go to--
[01:05:43.860 --> 01:05:44.580]   If I'm in Africa--
[01:05:44.580 --> 01:05:45.300]   You only need it to say--
[01:05:45.300 --> 01:05:46.100]   --it's about once.
[01:05:46.100 --> 01:05:47.940]   Well, if I'm in Africa and something goes wrong,
[01:05:47.940 --> 01:05:49.980]   it isn't like there's an Apple store to go to.
[01:05:49.980 --> 01:05:51.820]   And I've been really thinking about just having that
[01:05:51.820 --> 01:05:54.940]   in my backpack just in a way just so I can restart it.
[01:05:54.940 --> 01:05:57.260]   And I've had that kind of stuff happen.
[01:05:57.260 --> 01:05:59.220]   And just to pick up on something that you said, Scott,
[01:05:59.220 --> 01:06:01.500]   because I have had trouble getting my beloved disk
[01:06:01.500 --> 01:06:03.060]   warrior to work.
[01:06:03.060 --> 01:06:04.900]   And I've never understood the directions for getting it
[01:06:04.900 --> 01:06:07.780]   to work with Intel because I'm not particularly bright.
[01:06:07.780 --> 01:06:09.980]   But you're saying TechTool Pro will work with Intel
[01:06:09.980 --> 01:06:12.060]   where disk warrior does not?
[01:06:12.060 --> 01:06:12.580]   That's correct.
[01:06:12.580 --> 01:06:16.820]   4.5.2 of TechTool Pro is Intel compatible.
[01:06:16.820 --> 01:06:18.740]   So that's $98 off the rack.
[01:06:18.740 --> 01:06:22.740]   And you got to deal on it upgrading from what's on your drive.
[01:06:22.740 --> 01:06:24.740]   If you get AppleCare, you get the--
[01:06:24.740 --> 01:06:25.340]   Oh, I see.
[01:06:25.340 --> 01:06:26.060]   --through the down version.
[01:06:26.060 --> 01:06:26.900]   And they'll upgrade it.
[01:06:26.900 --> 01:06:28.900]   At least I got a coupon for $25.
[01:06:28.900 --> 01:06:30.180]   I don't know if that's a standard deal,
[01:06:30.180 --> 01:06:32.180]   but they sent me one and I took advantage of it.
[01:06:32.180 --> 01:06:36.020]   So for $25, I got TechTool Pro 4.5.2.
[01:06:36.020 --> 01:06:39.220]   And if all it did was the one thing it's already done for me,
[01:06:39.220 --> 01:06:41.460]   I would have thought that a good investment.
[01:06:41.460 --> 01:06:44.380]   And it's always a good point to mention--
[01:06:44.380 --> 01:06:45.820]   Don't use Norton.
[01:06:45.820 --> 01:06:46.620]   Don't use Norton.
[01:06:46.620 --> 01:06:47.420]   Don't-- please.
[01:06:47.420 --> 01:06:48.020]   Don't ever.
[01:06:48.020 --> 01:06:49.180]   Don't ever do that.
[01:06:49.180 --> 01:06:51.020]   John.
[01:06:51.020 --> 01:06:53.140]   The coolest thing that's blowing my mind right now
[01:06:53.140 --> 01:06:55.420]   is a program called X-TORNT.
[01:06:55.420 --> 01:07:00.420]   It's a beta version of a torrent client, or of a bit torrent
[01:07:00.420 --> 01:07:01.620]   client.
[01:07:01.620 --> 01:07:04.020]   And it comes from X-TORNT.
[01:07:04.020 --> 01:07:04.620]   David Watnabe.
[01:07:04.620 --> 01:07:06.660]   P2P.com.
[01:07:06.660 --> 01:07:08.460]   OK, so the coolest thing about this
[01:07:08.460 --> 01:07:10.940]   is that I searched for a torrent.
[01:07:10.940 --> 01:07:12.140]   I saw it in the list.
[01:07:12.140 --> 01:07:13.540]   I double clicked it.
[01:07:13.540 --> 01:07:15.340]   It automatically started downloading it.
[01:07:15.340 --> 01:07:20.940]   I didn't have to go point my client to the torrent file
[01:07:20.940 --> 01:07:21.700]   and select a place.
[01:07:21.700 --> 01:07:23.020]   You didn't have to fire up a jury, yes.
[01:07:23.020 --> 01:07:23.780]   Nah, there was no--
[01:07:23.780 --> 01:07:25.060]   Is it faster?
[01:07:25.060 --> 01:07:26.220]   It's pretty fast.
[01:07:26.220 --> 01:07:27.660]   And the thing that I noticed about this
[01:07:27.660 --> 01:07:31.820]   was that it's really good about the file share.
[01:07:31.820 --> 01:07:37.740]   So kicking the bits back to the kids,
[01:07:37.740 --> 01:07:43.220]   whereas a lot of places or a lot of torrent clients
[01:07:43.220 --> 01:07:48.140]   seem to be very slow at the upload.
[01:07:48.140 --> 01:07:50.300]   And so the couple of things that I've downloaded
[01:07:50.300 --> 01:07:55.660]   and the torrent-wise in the last week have been 100%
[01:07:55.660 --> 01:07:58.420]   shared back, which is a pretty big deal.
[01:07:58.420 --> 01:07:58.900]   It's remarkable.
[01:07:58.900 --> 01:07:59.860]   Yeah.
[01:07:59.860 --> 01:08:02.860]   Because on Azure, you've got to ping it to reload
[01:08:02.860 --> 01:08:05.580]   and check the tracker again to get it to do that.
[01:08:05.580 --> 01:08:07.260]   So it's really good about that.
[01:08:07.260 --> 01:08:10.660]   So the other thing that happens is that it shows a--
[01:08:10.660 --> 01:08:12.740]   there's a couple of tabs that come up.
[01:08:12.740 --> 01:08:15.780]   So one of them is a Google tab, and the other one is Yahoo.
[01:08:15.780 --> 01:08:18.100]   So if the torrent that you're looking for
[01:08:18.100 --> 01:08:21.740]   isn't in that main list, it might be in the other thing.
[01:08:21.740 --> 01:08:25.900]   So it shows the web page in XTorrent.
[01:08:25.900 --> 01:08:29.340]   So this is basically using Apple WebKit to show this.
[01:08:29.340 --> 01:08:31.100]   And then you find the torrent.
[01:08:31.100 --> 01:08:33.620]   You click the torrent to download it, and you're like,
[01:08:33.620 --> 01:08:34.260]   where did it go?
[01:08:34.260 --> 01:08:35.740]   And it's already downloading.
[01:08:35.740 --> 01:08:36.580]   Wow.
[01:08:36.580 --> 01:08:39.740]   So if you're into torrents, this sounds like the thing to go.
[01:08:39.740 --> 01:08:42.780]   And so the mind blow was that here's this thing that's
[01:08:42.780 --> 01:08:45.460]   basically just surfing the web.
[01:08:45.460 --> 01:08:48.900]   But instead of downloading it and putting it in a file
[01:08:48.900 --> 01:08:53.020]   and making me deal with it, it just does it.
[01:08:53.020 --> 01:08:55.380]   Cool thing about this is it takes the geekiness out
[01:08:55.380 --> 01:08:56.300]   of the torrents.
[01:08:56.300 --> 01:08:56.820]   I'm not.
[01:08:56.820 --> 01:08:59.940]   I'm just dealing with a file at this point.
[01:08:59.940 --> 01:09:01.620]   Totally transparent.
[01:09:01.620 --> 01:09:03.220]   That is-- that's tasty.
[01:09:03.220 --> 01:09:06.180]   And I know that after John actually posted it
[01:09:06.180 --> 01:09:08.900]   on the Pixel Core forum, I think that there's a whole bunch
[01:09:08.900 --> 01:09:10.700]   of people here that were downloading it.
[01:09:10.700 --> 01:09:14.340]   I haven't gotten to it yet, but everyone's been impressed.
[01:09:14.340 --> 01:09:18.020]   So another-- the last thing about this is that somebody
[01:09:18.020 --> 01:09:19.380]   emailed me a torrent file.
[01:09:19.380 --> 01:09:20.940]   I should hear it check this out.
[01:09:20.940 --> 01:09:24.700]   So I dragged it out of my email, or mail.app.
[01:09:24.700 --> 01:09:26.940]   I put it on the desktop.
[01:09:26.940 --> 01:09:28.260]   Xtorant was already running.
[01:09:28.260 --> 01:09:31.820]   And I'm like, oh, I'll just switch to Xtorant and open the file.
[01:09:31.820 --> 01:09:32.540]   I didn't have to.
[01:09:32.540 --> 01:09:34.260]   It automatically found it.
[01:09:34.260 --> 01:09:39.780]   It was scanning the desktop for torrent files as a default.
[01:09:39.780 --> 01:09:40.980]   And so it's just--
[01:09:40.980 --> 01:09:42.060]   It's magical.
[01:09:42.060 --> 01:09:44.420]   And it picked it up and it started downloading it.
[01:09:44.420 --> 01:09:46.740]   And I'm like, but the thing that happened
[01:09:46.740 --> 01:09:48.140]   was that I switched to the Finder.
[01:09:48.140 --> 01:09:50.180]   I was going to drag it into the thing to make.
[01:09:50.180 --> 01:09:51.500]   Like, where did the torrent file go?
[01:09:51.500 --> 01:09:52.780]   I know I dragged it.
[01:09:52.780 --> 01:09:53.260]   It was already--
[01:09:53.260 --> 01:09:54.580]   It was already dealt with.
[01:09:54.580 --> 01:09:55.100]   Wow.
[01:09:55.100 --> 01:09:56.060]   And so that's--
[01:09:56.060 --> 01:09:56.940]   So that's Xtorant.
[01:09:56.940 --> 01:09:57.340]   Xtorant.
[01:09:57.340 --> 01:09:58.220]   And where can you find it?
[01:09:58.220 --> 01:10:01.500]   Xtorantp2p.com.
[01:10:01.500 --> 01:10:05.420]   And it's by David Watnabe, the genius behind "Newsfire."
[01:10:05.420 --> 01:10:06.980]   Wonderful RSS reader.
[01:10:06.980 --> 01:10:07.500]   Yeah, pretty cool.
[01:10:07.500 --> 01:10:09.060]   Isn't that the guy from "Lost?"
[01:10:09.060 --> 01:10:10.500]   No.
[01:10:10.500 --> 01:10:11.020]   OK.
[01:10:11.020 --> 01:10:12.500]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:10:12.500 --> 01:10:15.660]   John doesn't like it when we talk about "Lost."
[01:10:15.660 --> 01:10:17.100]   All right, there you go.
[01:10:17.100 --> 01:10:20.780]   So Scott, where can people find it more of your writing--
[01:10:20.780 --> 01:10:22.540]   Well, I'm all over the place.
[01:10:22.540 --> 01:10:25.940]   Hanging out a lot lately at the Inside Aperture blog
[01:10:25.940 --> 01:10:26.660]   for O'Reilly.
[01:10:26.660 --> 01:10:29.740]   And then, of course, I've got my podcasting tricks blog.
[01:10:29.740 --> 01:10:33.140]   And probably a good time for you and I to mention GMT, Alex.
[01:10:33.140 --> 01:10:35.380]   We should have it up, hopefully, by the end of the week
[01:10:35.380 --> 01:10:37.140]   or the very beginning of next week.
[01:10:37.140 --> 01:10:39.340]   We're going to have a gear media tech
[01:10:39.340 --> 01:10:44.460]   where Scott, Leo, and I go crazy over lots of obscure--
[01:10:44.460 --> 01:10:46.900]   well, actually, not so obscure, but cool hardware
[01:10:46.900 --> 01:10:48.580]   for both mostly audio.
[01:10:48.580 --> 01:10:51.620]   But I'm going to be doing some video segments
[01:10:51.620 --> 01:10:54.100]   that we're going to drop in there as well.
[01:10:54.100 --> 01:10:54.940]   And I'm just working through it.
[01:10:54.940 --> 01:10:58.900]   I'm trying to finish episode number one.
[01:10:58.900 --> 01:11:01.740]   So I think we're actually pretty close.
[01:11:01.740 --> 01:11:03.580]   So that should be a lot of fun.
[01:11:03.580 --> 01:11:06.180]   And "Murlinman," 43 folders?
[01:11:06.180 --> 01:11:06.500]   That's right.
[01:11:06.500 --> 01:11:08.780]   43folders.com.
[01:11:08.780 --> 01:11:10.620]   I haven't posted a lot lately.
[01:11:10.620 --> 01:11:12.700]   I've been really--
[01:11:12.700 --> 01:11:14.540]   I was telling John before the show.
[01:11:14.540 --> 01:11:18.820]   It's so painfully ironic to be a disorganized person who's
[01:11:18.820 --> 01:11:22.180]   supposed to be really organized, and it hurts.
[01:11:22.180 --> 01:11:25.380]   But no, one good thing we recently had come out.
[01:11:25.380 --> 01:11:29.340]   I just put out the compilation single download podcast
[01:11:29.340 --> 01:11:32.100]   of the eight-episode series interview
[01:11:32.100 --> 01:11:35.620]   that I did with David Allen, the author of "Getting Things Done."
[01:11:35.620 --> 01:11:40.420]   So you can grab that and get an hour and a half of David
[01:11:40.420 --> 01:11:44.380]   Allen goodness to theoretically productive men who talk very
[01:11:44.380 --> 01:11:45.780]   fast.
[01:11:45.780 --> 01:11:48.540]   If you're into David Allen, "Getting Things Done,"
[01:11:48.540 --> 01:11:51.820]   or just interested in learning more about it,
[01:11:51.820 --> 01:11:53.020]   I really recommend it.
[01:11:53.020 --> 01:11:54.220]   David did some really good stuff.
[01:11:54.220 --> 01:11:58.420]   And some real GTD gold came out of that.
[01:11:58.420 --> 01:12:00.620]   Be sure to get the enhanced version of that.
[01:12:00.620 --> 01:12:03.060]   You can get the enhanced version on my bandwidth, Bill,
[01:12:03.060 --> 01:12:04.900]   where you can get the little chapters.
[01:12:04.900 --> 01:12:05.980]   Did you actually download that?
[01:12:05.980 --> 01:12:06.660]   Yeah, I did.
[01:12:06.660 --> 01:12:08.260]   And I worked OK for you.
[01:12:08.260 --> 01:12:10.860]   The chapters-- because I'm like, oh, you know--
[01:12:10.860 --> 01:12:12.620]   Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[01:12:12.620 --> 01:12:16.580]   Getting things done is like, OK, so it's an interesting thing,
[01:12:16.580 --> 01:12:19.940]   but I'm like, OK, this is to be taken in in little tiny bytes.
[01:12:19.940 --> 01:12:20.860]   That's really smart.
[01:12:20.860 --> 01:12:21.860]   That's true.
[01:12:21.860 --> 01:12:23.860]   This is not something--
[01:12:23.860 --> 01:12:27.540]   GTD is not something that you can just go, I'm doing it.
[01:12:27.540 --> 01:12:29.260]   You have to do it over time.
[01:12:29.260 --> 01:12:31.820]   And I just smashed my head for those of you who--
[01:12:31.820 --> 01:12:35.940]   I'm not smacking Sam as a deep dump.
[01:12:35.940 --> 01:12:37.740]   John, where can people find you?
[01:12:37.740 --> 01:12:40.660]   You can find me pixacore.com/forms,
[01:12:40.660 --> 01:12:43.860]   but you actually have to be a member to see that.
[01:12:43.860 --> 01:12:44.540]   So--
[01:12:44.540 --> 01:12:45.340]   If you're not a member.
[01:12:45.340 --> 01:12:49.100]   If you're not a member, twit.tv/forms.
[01:12:49.100 --> 01:12:50.740]   There you go.
[01:12:50.740 --> 01:12:53.980]   And what's up with you, Alex?
[01:12:53.980 --> 01:12:56.420]   You're struggling with equipment.
[01:12:56.420 --> 01:12:58.340]   It seems like you're wrestling with opportunities
[01:12:58.340 --> 01:12:59.500]   and equipment.
[01:12:59.500 --> 01:13:03.140]   I'm mostly just wrestling with just an enormous amount of work.
[01:13:03.140 --> 01:13:04.860]   I'm drowning in opportunity.
[01:13:04.860 --> 01:13:07.700]   So sometimes you're busy and sometimes you're not.
[01:13:07.700 --> 01:13:08.780]   I'm mostly just busy.
[01:13:08.780 --> 01:13:10.780]   And it's gotten to the point where--
[01:13:10.780 --> 01:13:14.700]   I'd like to--
[01:13:14.700 --> 01:13:15.340]   Too much.
[01:13:15.340 --> 01:13:17.260]   It's a little too much right now.
[01:13:17.260 --> 01:13:18.460]   But I'm just having a good time.
[01:13:18.460 --> 01:13:24.460]   And you can find more of my stuff at Macbreak weekly.
[01:13:24.460 --> 01:13:25.180]   That's what I do.
[01:13:25.180 --> 01:13:26.260]   I'll do pod chaos.
[01:13:26.260 --> 01:13:27.740]   You need to pixacore.
[01:13:27.740 --> 01:13:29.860]   I do need-- I do need-- you know, I
[01:13:29.860 --> 01:13:35.020]   was thinking about the wonders of the Pizziz earlier today.
[01:13:35.020 --> 01:13:39.340]   And instead of pizzizzing, I just went and got a latte.
[01:13:39.340 --> 01:13:40.780]   But I think it would have been a healthy--
[01:13:40.780 --> 01:13:42.660]   No, but I'm sending you an electronic chia pet.
[01:13:42.660 --> 01:13:43.700]   That'll get you through the night.
[01:13:43.700 --> 01:13:47.940]   I think of it with electronic chia pet and a pizziz, I'll be set.
[01:13:47.940 --> 01:13:48.260]   OK.
[01:13:48.260 --> 01:13:49.460]   That's it.
[01:13:49.460 --> 01:13:54.060]   Another Macbreak weekly is broken.
[01:13:54.060 --> 01:13:54.420]   Cool.
[01:13:54.420 --> 01:13:55.420]   I like that, Scott.
[01:13:55.420 --> 01:13:57.180]   I think that's good.
[01:13:57.180 --> 01:13:57.680]   It's broken.
[01:13:57.680 --> 01:13:58.420]   We call it good.
[01:13:58.420 --> 01:14:00.020]   Yeah.
[01:14:00.020 --> 01:14:02.060]   Another-- another Macbreak.
[01:14:02.060 --> 01:14:03.500]   Didn't broken.
[01:14:03.500 --> 01:14:04.260]   It was really broken.
[01:14:04.260 --> 01:14:06.180]   It was not but nally.
[01:14:06.180 --> 01:14:08.620]   Because it's Macbreak.
[01:14:08.620 --> 01:14:09.140]   Yeah.
[01:14:09.140 --> 01:14:10.020]   That's good.
[01:14:10.020 --> 01:14:10.540]   It's Scott.
[01:14:10.540 --> 01:14:11.180]   That was Scott's.
[01:14:11.180 --> 01:14:12.500]   That's what you call a way homer.
[01:14:12.500 --> 01:14:12.860]   Yeah.
[01:14:12.860 --> 01:14:15.460]   Well, we've been trying to find our way home for 18 episodes.
[01:14:15.460 --> 01:14:17.860]   I figured eventually I was actually going to--
[01:14:17.860 --> 01:14:18.860]   I want credit for that.
[01:14:18.860 --> 01:14:19.420]   I came up with--
[01:14:19.420 --> 01:14:20.460]   I did.
[01:14:20.460 --> 01:14:23.060]   I gave you props on that one.
[01:14:23.060 --> 01:14:23.580]   Yeah, I know.
[01:14:23.580 --> 01:14:24.020]   Yeah.
[01:14:24.020 --> 01:14:25.420]   I don't know if that made it into the show.
[01:14:25.420 --> 01:14:29.300]   But I think given the fact that I'm sitting here next to three
[01:14:29.300 --> 01:14:31.020]   people smarter than me, I came up with it.
[01:14:31.020 --> 01:14:33.100]   Hey, are you still recording?
[01:14:33.100 --> 01:14:33.500]   I am.
[01:14:33.500 --> 01:14:34.940]   So you all, it'll make it into the show then.
[01:14:34.940 --> 01:14:35.820]   Because this is all after this.
[01:14:35.820 --> 01:14:36.780]   I'm going to stop.
[01:14:36.780 --> 01:14:37.140]   OK.
[01:14:37.140 --> 01:14:37.460]   All right.
[01:14:37.460 --> 01:14:37.740]   Stop.
[01:14:37.740 --> 01:14:38.900]   All right, fine.
[01:14:38.900 --> 01:14:39.400]   All right.
[01:14:39.400 --> 01:14:41.140]   Well, we're going to keep talking.
[01:14:41.140 --> 01:14:43.140]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:14:43.140 --> 01:14:43.900]   I actually have to stop.
[01:14:43.900 --> 01:14:44.400]   Yeah.
[01:14:44.400 --> 01:14:47.380]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:14:47.380 --> 01:14:50.720]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:14:50.720 --> 01:14:54.060]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:14:54.060 --> 01:14:57.400]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:14:57.400 --> 01:14:59.980]   (upbeat music)
