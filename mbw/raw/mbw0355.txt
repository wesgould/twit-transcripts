[00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:09.660]   here.
[00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:10.880]   I've got it in my hot little hands.

[00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:50.360]   your Macintosh and Apple needs in obsessive detail.
[00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:52.360]   That's because we care.
[00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:53.040]   We care deeply.
[00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:54.640]   Andy Anaco cares.
[00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:56.760]   He's from the Chicago Sun Times.
[00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:57.800]   Heck yes, I care, Leo.
[00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:01.160]   It's been with his show since day Uno.
[00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:05.320]   Practically, if we're going to be installing
[00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:07.280]   this revisionist history, yes, absolutely.
[00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:08.280]   I am very embarrassed.
[00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:09.120]   Really not since the beginning?
[00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:13.760]   I'm there on the balcony, waving next to you, our leader.
[00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:17.040]   We got-- you know, I don't even remember that far back.
[00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:19.080]   It feels like you've always been here.
[00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:20.360]   Thank you very much.
[00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:22.640]   I like to feel like that wallpaper that's
[00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:23.960]   a little bit crusty and moldy.
[00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:25.960]   But we're moving it at this point.
[00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:28.680]   We require you to move all the furniture out and attack
[00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:29.680]   a whole bunch of the problems.
[00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:31.000]   So you may just leave it there.
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.920]   And that is the article of quality
[00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:35.760]   that I try to promise to you each and every listeners,
[00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:36.360]   each and every week.
[00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:38.080]   We might as well leave him here.
[00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:41.040]   It's not so bad that we have to do something about it.
[00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:42.480]   It's easy enough just to leave it there.
[00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:45.320]   Who is on number one?
[00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:47.000]   We don't know because we don't have--
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.600]   We didn't do so.
[00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:49.240]   We don't have any information at all on this.
[00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:50.600]   I can play the actual episode.
[00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:51.760]   No, that's not necessary.
[00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:53.840]   Mr. Scott Born, Mr. Merlin Mann.
[00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:56.560]   Yeah, with Scott Merlin, Alex Lindsay.
[00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:58.280]   Yeah, I guess you came along a little later.
[00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:59.000]   But we do love you.
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.400]   It doesn't seem like Mac Break weekly.
[00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:01.960]   Wait, wait, wait.
[00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:03.800]   I wasn't Mac Break's little accident.
[00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:06.160]   I was your unexpected miracle, that's what.
[00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:07.120]   Yeah.
[00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:08.040]   Yeah.
[00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:09.680]   You're a little surprised.
[00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:10.640]   Stirk brought him.
[00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:12.440]   You should have stopped at two hosts, Dad.
[00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:15.360]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:21.120]   Also, here is baby brother, Radei Ritchie from iBore.com.
[00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:21.680]   Hello, Renei.
[00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:22.240]   That's an Oliver.
[00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:22.760]   Hi, Lyle.
[00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:24.080]   I missed the brick house already.
[00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:25.840]   It's amazing how you see you get to it in just a couple days.
[00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:26.340]   I know.
[00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:28.360]   I feel like I saw you twice in a row, and it's like, gosh,
[00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:29.000]   where is he now?
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.560]   You're back in Montreal.
[00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:31.200]   I am.
[00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:32.520]   I went from the beautiful San Francisco
[00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:33.880]   to the sweltering hot Montreal,
[00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:35.880]   and that makes absolutely no sense in my brain.
[00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:37.080]   It's amazing.
[00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:39.200]   It's amazing with travel and all that,
[00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:41.400]   that you could be somewhere else now.
[00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:43.920]   The human body reels.
[00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:46.320]   If they just have hypersonic domestic flying,
[00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:47.520]   it would be miracle.
[00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:50.680]   And from 9 to 5 Mac, one of the best Mac--
[00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:55.840]   well, right after iBore.com, one of the best, absolutely best
[00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:56.320]   Mac sites.
[00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:57.600]   We re-refer to it all the time.
[00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:59.840]   And we refer to Mark German's articles all the time.
[00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:01.600]   Mark, it's great to have you on.
[00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:02.240]   Thanks for having me.
[00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:03.800]   I'm new around these parts.
[00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:04.240]   Yeah.
[00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:05.400]   This is your first time, I think.
[00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:06.120]   Yeah?
[00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:07.360]   Yeah, first time on the show.
[00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:08.200]   Excited.
[00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:09.560]   I'm really excited.
[00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:12.000]   We are always saying, Mark German says,
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:13.920]   so it's nice to actually find out what Mark German says
[00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:15.760]   in his own voice.
[00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:18.200]   Sorry, I'm misquoting you, Mark.
[00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:18.720]   Yeah.
[00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:19.920]   I'll quote myself.
[00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:23.400]   Last week's Mac break weekly was the day after WWDC.
[00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:26.080]   So we did cover quite a bit of WWDC.
[00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:27.400]   But now we've had some time.
[00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:31.800]   I got my airport extreme a couple of days ago, the new AC
[00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:32.160]   edition.
[00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:37.880]   I'm on my new MacBook Air 13-inch with AC.
[00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:40.360]   And you notice with no power plugged in,
[00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:42.960]   because I'm trying to see how much battery life I'm getting.
[00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:46.120]   As far as I can tell, that's the big difference at this point.
[00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:48.000]   Did you get one too, Renee?
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:48.520]   I did.
[00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:51.000]   It's got two microphones, which is like the only hardware
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:52.400]   change I could tell.
[00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:55.040]   And it's got that battery life improvement.
[00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:57.040]   Yeah.
[00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:00.280]   Yeah, I got the i7, 8 gigs of RAM.
[00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:02.120]   I probably shouldn't have.
[00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:03.080]   But I did.
[00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:04.400]   No, I did the same thing, Leo.
[00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:04.920]   You know why?
[00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:07.400]   Because if you either go big or you go netbook.
[00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:09.520]   I mean, there's no excuse for not getting the maxed out
[00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:10.920]   machine and just riding with it.
[00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:11.760]   Yeah.
[00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:14.480]   Especially because you have to be very, very fine grained
[00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:16.520]   with a microsurgery tool in order
[00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:18.560]   to put more RAM into this later on.
[00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:19.080]   Yes.
[00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:21.200]   So it's like if you got to eat Raman noodles for a month
[00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:23.120]   and a half to afford the maxed out RAM,
[00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:24.560]   you better get the maxed out RAM.
[00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:28.400]   I do have to say that one of the reasons I wanted to get this
[00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:33.200]   is to see if 802.11ac, which is the news.
[00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:36.600]   It's still draft, but the next generation Wi-Fi
[00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:39.440]   that is supported both by this and by my router
[00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:42.600]   and by my current Android phones, the HTC One
[00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:45.320]   and the Galaxy S4, if it makes any difference.
[00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:48.960]   And I feel a little foolish because last night
[00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:50.120]   I must have been half asleep.
[00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:52.080]   I tweeted, wow, I'm getting great results.
[00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:54.040]   But I realized there was exactly the same great results
[00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:55.240]   I got before.
[00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:58.120]   And it's really the limit was my cable internet provider,
[00:05:58.120 --> 00:05:59.400]   not anything else.
[00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:02.760]   I got 50 megabytes down, 11 megabytes--
[00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:06.280]   I'm sorry, 50 megabits down, 11 megabits up.
[00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:09.120]   And ping times around 19 milliseconds on Wi-Fi.
[00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:10.360]   That's pretty good for Wi-Fi.
[00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:15.280]   But 802 as numerous people pointed out on the Twitter,
[00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:17.840]   you know, that's the same as 802.11n.
[00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:19.000]   And it's absolutely true.
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:20.240]   I unplugged it and went back to n.
[00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:22.400]   And yes, it was exactly the same.
[00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:25.640]   But do we choose to be excited that wireless standards are
[00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:29.400]   now so great that they easily exceed any home broadband?
[00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:32.360]   Or we're going to be upset that, oh, copper is supposed
[00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:35.040]   to be faster than anything that anything there is?
[00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:37.800]   Well, yeah, I mean, I think if you're considering
[00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:39.800]   buying this router, for instance, you
[00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:42.160]   might consider your internet access speeds.
[00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:44.760]   Because the only reason you'd see a benefit
[00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:48.480]   in AC-- and I knew this because I'd tested some Buffalo AC
[00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:50.920]   router even almost a year ago--
[00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:54.160]   is in-house LAN copying.
[00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:55.600]   So for me, I mean, the big thing is
[00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:58.080]   going to be when the iPhone or the Apple TV presumably
[00:06:58.080 --> 00:07:00.680]   get AC, and then I don't have to have it on LAN anymore.
[00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:03.080]   It'll actually be fast enough to stream all my video
[00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:03.640]   around the house.
[00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:05.240]   Right.
[00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:08.080]   Have you been able to fine tune it for like steering
[00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:09.320]   and stuff like that?
[00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:13.000]   Because the other advantage might be that if you have
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000]   like spotty receptions at parts of your house,
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.280]   and you don't want to have to have interconnected base
[00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:20.920]   stations to get coverage, that maybe one of these AC
[00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:22.080]   base stations will do it for you.
[00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:23.720]   Well, I did a few experiments.
[00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:26.760]   It works very well all over the house at exactly the same speed.
[00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:29.400]   So the beamforming may, in fact, be doing something.
[00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:33.240]   There's no settings in the airport utility to say,
[00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:35.720]   turn on beamforming or anything like that.
[00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:37.320]   It looks exactly the same.
[00:07:37.320 --> 00:07:38.120]   Beamform left.
[00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:39.120]   Beamform left.
[00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:40.640]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:41.840]   Oh, my god.
[00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:43.240]   Get the children out of the way.
[00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:44.560]   The beams are out of control.
[00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:46.040]   I can cover.
[00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:50.600]   One of the disadvantages of AC is it's 5 gigahertz only.
[00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:52.120]   So it's very high frequency.
[00:07:52.120 --> 00:07:55.960]   So it would, in theory, not do as well through walls,
[00:07:55.960 --> 00:07:57.480]   through metal.
[00:07:57.480 --> 00:07:58.880]   The higher the frequency, the more likely
[00:07:58.880 --> 00:08:01.040]   it is to bounce off materials.
[00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:03.040]   In fact, that's one reason some experts are saying,
[00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:06.560]   wait to AD the next generation, because that will be dual band.
[00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:11.360]   Have all of the benefits of AC, but also be 2.4 gigahertz.
[00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:12.320]   And I have to concur.
[00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:14.560]   I can't see-- oh, I did some other experiments,
[00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:18.120]   because one of the problems that sometimes people have,
[00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:22.080]   if you put WDS, if you set up a repeater, an airport
[00:08:22.080 --> 00:08:25.000]   expressor, an airport, another airport
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   as a repeater using something called WDS.
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.440]   We know where it says, extend this wireless network
[00:08:30.440 --> 00:08:31.880]   in the airport stuff.
[00:08:31.880 --> 00:08:33.920]   I've been told by RIT guys and others
[00:08:33.920 --> 00:08:37.240]   that that will cut the bandwidth in half.
[00:08:37.240 --> 00:08:38.240]   That was not my experience.
[00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:42.360]   I took the old airport extreme, put it upstairs
[00:08:42.360 --> 00:08:45.040]   as a WDS extending router.
[00:08:45.040 --> 00:08:50.280]   And it did not impact-- still, 4 megabits down and 11 up.
[00:08:50.280 --> 00:08:52.600]   It didn't change anything.
[00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:56.440]   So I don't know if that's Apple doing something smart.
[00:08:56.440 --> 00:08:58.120]   I don't think it's an AC specific thing,
[00:08:58.120 --> 00:08:59.920]   but it is good news if you buy this new one.
[00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:02.840]   You could at least keep the old one, extend your network,
[00:09:02.840 --> 00:09:05.240]   and not slow anything down.
[00:09:05.240 --> 00:09:08.640]   In fact, it really now, my house is just radiating,
[00:09:08.640 --> 00:09:12.040]   pulsing with megahertz all over the place.
[00:09:12.040 --> 00:09:13.880]   Do you notice, like, microwave popcorn,
[00:09:13.880 --> 00:09:16.200]   just sort of cooking itself in the package on the closet?
[00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:17.920]   Yeah, it's marvelous.
[00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:18.760]   I would get that.
[00:09:18.760 --> 00:09:20.200]   You just open it up and it's done.
[00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:22.520]   And thanks to LTE, you get that all over 10, Leo.
[00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:23.760]   It's not just one frequency.
[00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:27.200]   So I think the really important note to make--
[00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:29.360]   and it's somewhat true of the error as well.
[00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:33.920]   I'll tell you why-- is that in normal use,
[00:09:33.920 --> 00:09:36.320]   you're not going to benefit from AC.
[00:09:36.320 --> 00:09:37.880]   There's some special cases.
[00:09:37.880 --> 00:09:41.160]   If you bought the time machine with the hard drive built in,
[00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:42.680]   or what do they call it?
[00:09:42.680 --> 00:09:43.200]   Time capsule.
[00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:44.200]   Time capsule.
[00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:44.920]   Time capsule.
[00:09:44.920 --> 00:09:47.080]   Then presumably, although I didn't buy it,
[00:09:47.080 --> 00:09:50.680]   you would see the benefit in transfers to the time capsule.
[00:09:50.680 --> 00:09:53.440]   I did try plugging a USB drive into the back,
[00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:54.680]   because it has a port for that.
[00:09:54.680 --> 00:09:55.680]   It was extremely slow.
[00:09:55.680 --> 00:09:58.880]   I did not see any improvement.
[00:09:58.880 --> 00:09:59.240]   Let's see.
[00:09:59.240 --> 00:10:00.680]   What else could I--
[00:10:00.680 --> 00:10:05.680]   until I have an Apple TV with AC or Roku with it--
[00:10:05.680 --> 00:10:08.200]   a lot more devices have AC.
[00:10:08.200 --> 00:10:10.440]   There's no benefit at all.
[00:10:10.440 --> 00:10:13.600]   But that's an infrastructure decision.
[00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:14.200]   Of course.
[00:10:14.200 --> 00:10:15.600]   It doesn't pay off immediately.
[00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:18.160]   But suddenly, when you get your phone in nine months
[00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:20.480]   or a year, you find that it works really great.
[00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:22.600]   When you get your next version of your game console
[00:10:22.600 --> 00:10:25.400]   or your Roku box, you find out that it works great.
[00:10:25.400 --> 00:10:28.440]   I don't think that the new airport is a reason
[00:10:28.440 --> 00:10:31.760]   to swap out your perfectly functional current airports
[00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:32.320]   for new ones.
[00:10:32.320 --> 00:10:35.040]   But for the same amount of money when you're buying new stuff,
[00:10:35.040 --> 00:10:36.320]   you know that you're going to get something that's
[00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:37.440]   going to be a lot more useful for you
[00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:38.800]   in the next two or three years.
[00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:39.280]   Yeah.
[00:10:39.280 --> 00:10:40.800]   So certainly, if you're buying a new one,
[00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:41.680]   I would buy the new one.
[00:10:41.680 --> 00:10:43.200]   Although, again, you might want to--
[00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:45.080]   if you don't-- first of all, don't upgrade just because I
[00:10:45.080 --> 00:10:45.720]   want the latest.
[00:10:45.720 --> 00:10:47.080]   That's not going to benefit you.
[00:10:47.080 --> 00:10:50.040]   Second, if you can, wait till AD comes out.
[00:10:50.040 --> 00:10:51.480]   Now, Apple's slow.
[00:10:51.480 --> 00:10:53.880]   So Apple will be at least a year before AD is here,
[00:10:53.880 --> 00:10:57.080]   if not longer, because they don't jump on this stuff.
[00:10:57.080 --> 00:11:01.880]   Now, I have to say, 30 megabits symmetric on the Galaxy S4
[00:11:01.880 --> 00:11:03.400]   of via Wi-Fi.
[00:11:03.400 --> 00:11:04.840]   So that's nice.
[00:11:04.840 --> 00:11:06.240]   I was kind of disappointed there aren't any more
[00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:06.960]   ethernet ports.
[00:11:06.960 --> 00:11:08.280]   I thought the new giant size would
[00:11:08.280 --> 00:11:09.000]   look at least a lot of--
[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:09.360]   Yeah, actually, I--
[00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:10.000]   a few more ethernet ports.
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:11.920]   They could have, and I wish they had.
[00:11:11.920 --> 00:11:14.400]   It's exactly the same as the previous airport extreme.
[00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:16.200]   Which isn't quite enough for me, because now you
[00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:19.760]   have your Xboxes and your PlayStations and your Apple TVs.
[00:11:19.760 --> 00:11:21.720]   And the more I can get the better.
[00:11:21.720 --> 00:11:25.440]   So it's not going to give you faster internet in all likelihood.
[00:11:25.440 --> 00:11:27.760]   You're already faster than your internet anyway,
[00:11:27.760 --> 00:11:30.000]   unless you have remarkably faster internet.
[00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:31.600]   It's not going to give you much benefit
[00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:34.440]   until you have other infrastructure AC devices.
[00:11:34.440 --> 00:11:36.200]   It conceivably could give you benefit
[00:11:36.200 --> 00:11:38.640]   as a time capsule in terms of copying.
[00:11:38.640 --> 00:11:42.240]   And we've seen that on AC, NASA's other companies,
[00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:45.080]   NASA's, that it does make a difference in performance.
[00:11:45.080 --> 00:11:47.760]   And it doesn't look like you can easily add a hard drive
[00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:50.600]   to the airport extreme if you get that in view of a time
[00:11:50.600 --> 00:11:50.760]   capture.
[00:11:50.760 --> 00:11:52.200]   There's no SATA connector, right?
[00:11:52.200 --> 00:11:52.680]   Yeah.
[00:11:52.680 --> 00:11:53.960]   There's a slot.
[00:11:53.960 --> 00:11:54.800]   Yeah.
[00:11:54.800 --> 00:11:56.440]   But there's no connector.
[00:11:56.440 --> 00:11:58.160]   And I think I fix it.
[00:11:58.160 --> 00:12:00.360]   Hypophysized you could solder a connector on.
[00:12:00.360 --> 00:12:01.840]   I leave that as an exercise for the--
[00:12:01.840 --> 00:12:04.720]   If you're Kyle or if you're a Nantec, maybe you can do that.
[00:12:04.720 --> 00:12:05.280]   Not me.
[00:12:05.280 --> 00:12:06.720]   Not me.
[00:12:06.720 --> 00:12:08.960]   Sort of interesting that they demoted the time capsule,
[00:12:08.960 --> 00:12:11.320]   because the previous model was really just
[00:12:11.320 --> 00:12:12.400]   called the time capsule.
[00:12:12.400 --> 00:12:16.200]   And now they integrated it directly into the airport line.
[00:12:16.200 --> 00:12:19.000]   I think it's called the airport time capsule now.
[00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:21.560]   So it'll be interesting to see a few years down the line
[00:12:21.560 --> 00:12:23.760]   if they only ship one model with the built-in hard drive.
[00:12:23.760 --> 00:12:25.200]   That could become standard.
[00:12:25.200 --> 00:12:28.760]   So it's just interesting to me why they would change the name,
[00:12:28.760 --> 00:12:30.480]   even though it's minor.
[00:12:30.480 --> 00:12:32.080]   How about a nice SSD time capsule
[00:12:32.080 --> 00:12:33.320]   which I'll solder onto the motherboard?
[00:12:33.320 --> 00:12:36.240]   Yeah, that would be the way to do it, right?
[00:12:36.240 --> 00:12:41.080]   Although I use a USB 3 SSD external drive on the thing.
[00:12:41.080 --> 00:12:42.240]   And it was really slow.
[00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:45.440]   So I think it's USB 2 on there.
[00:12:45.440 --> 00:12:48.360]   It's not USB 3, that's for sure.
[00:12:48.360 --> 00:12:49.320]   It's too bad.
[00:12:49.320 --> 00:12:49.880]   Yeah.
[00:12:49.880 --> 00:12:51.360]   That would have been nice, huh?
[00:12:51.360 --> 00:12:55.560]   I also would like to see-- have you used the SkyDog Wi-Fi router?
[00:12:55.560 --> 00:12:57.320]   No, SkyDog.
[00:12:57.320 --> 00:13:01.360]   It's a router that really-- it's a good router.
[00:13:01.360 --> 00:13:04.160]   But what you really like about it is the admin features,
[00:13:04.160 --> 00:13:07.520]   where it has a really cool web interface and mobile interface
[00:13:07.520 --> 00:13:11.000]   so that everything that is a pain in the butt
[00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:13.640]   about configuring and managing a router, like, OK,
[00:13:13.640 --> 00:13:15.360]   I have to open a port for this device,
[00:13:15.360 --> 00:13:17.760]   or I have to make sure that a Skype call will get the--
[00:13:17.760 --> 00:13:19.680]   will get the biggest bandwidth in matter
[00:13:19.680 --> 00:13:21.120]   what's happening over there.
[00:13:21.120 --> 00:13:23.480]   All the way down to, I want to make sure that my kids only
[00:13:23.480 --> 00:13:26.600]   get 30 minutes worth of access a day, or access
[00:13:26.600 --> 00:13:32.080]   to Facebook a day, and that they can access cons academy
[00:13:32.080 --> 00:13:33.480]   as much as they want all day long.
[00:13:33.480 --> 00:13:35.760]   But here are services where they can only use it for one
[00:13:35.760 --> 00:13:37.560]   hour a day, and they limit the bandwidth.
[00:13:37.560 --> 00:13:39.080]   All these really fine-grained ways
[00:13:39.080 --> 00:13:41.720]   to sort of fine-tune access to your house
[00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:44.720]   so that things happen only the way that you want it to.
[00:13:44.720 --> 00:13:48.600]   And although the airport base station is still hands down
[00:13:48.600 --> 00:13:50.200]   the easiest to set up and configure,
[00:13:50.200 --> 00:13:52.720]   I mean, it's basically-- it's almost ready to go
[00:13:52.720 --> 00:13:55.920]   before you even plug it into the wall outlet.
[00:13:55.920 --> 00:13:57.360]   It's all configured so quickly.
[00:13:57.360 --> 00:13:58.760]   I think that a lot of people really
[00:13:58.760 --> 00:14:01.840]   want to see that kind of ability to control who gets
[00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:05.120]   to access their network and what kind of devices
[00:14:05.120 --> 00:14:07.240]   get access to the biggest part of the pipe.
[00:14:07.240 --> 00:14:10.720]   I love this new thing of using your phone
[00:14:10.720 --> 00:14:15.640]   or your iPad to control stuff, like your lights, your TV,
[00:14:15.640 --> 00:14:16.400]   your network.
[00:14:16.400 --> 00:14:17.880]   That's awesome.
[00:14:17.880 --> 00:14:19.280]   Yes, that's awesome.
[00:14:19.280 --> 00:14:23.960]   The friend of mine has a new Tesla S. And he almost has to.
[00:14:23.960 --> 00:14:25.720]   It's like sometimes he'll be running errands
[00:14:25.720 --> 00:14:27.560]   and you can't take the dog inside.
[00:14:27.560 --> 00:14:30.000]   But it's OK because through his phone,
[00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.720]   he can control the temperature of the inside of the car,
[00:14:32.720 --> 00:14:34.360]   turn the air conditioning on.
[00:14:34.360 --> 00:14:35.880]   And the only fault in that is that he
[00:14:35.880 --> 00:14:38.520]   has to have a sign made up for the inside of the window saying,
[00:14:38.520 --> 00:14:41.240]   it's OK, please put your-- before you smash the window
[00:14:41.240 --> 00:14:43.640]   to, quote, "rescue my dog, put your hand against the glass
[00:14:43.640 --> 00:14:45.040]   and feel how cold it is.
[00:14:45.040 --> 00:14:48.360]   I'm controlling the temperature with my iPhone."
[00:14:48.360 --> 00:14:50.200]   It's magic.
[00:14:50.200 --> 00:14:53.160]   Skydog, by the way, is a pre-order.
[00:14:53.160 --> 00:14:54.240]   It's not out till September.
[00:14:54.240 --> 00:14:54.840]   Yeah, sorry.
[00:14:54.840 --> 00:14:55.720]   But I'm sorry.
[00:14:55.720 --> 00:14:57.400]   It was a Kickstarter campaign.
[00:14:57.400 --> 00:14:58.960]   And hardware is going out to people who funded it.
[00:14:58.960 --> 00:15:01.360]   But that's the sort of stuff I'd love to see Apple do.
[00:15:01.360 --> 00:15:03.840]   Because you may or may not realize the benefits
[00:15:03.840 --> 00:15:05.160]   of a brand new wireless standard.
[00:15:05.160 --> 00:15:08.160]   You will definitely realize the benefits of being able to say,
[00:15:08.160 --> 00:15:10.160]   Skype calls get as much of the bandwidth
[00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:11.840]   as you can possibly give it immediately.
[00:15:11.840 --> 00:15:16.160]   And my kids don't get to go to 4chan.
[00:15:16.160 --> 00:15:17.840]   How much is this?
[00:15:17.840 --> 00:15:20.040]   It's concurrent end, dual band.
[00:15:20.040 --> 00:15:23.200]   How much is it?
[00:15:23.200 --> 00:15:23.680]   Think of it.
[00:15:23.680 --> 00:15:27.560]   Ethernet has got four ports.
[00:15:27.560 --> 00:15:30.360]   Yeah, I mean, I have to say, there are companies
[00:15:30.360 --> 00:15:34.480]   that are innovating better in this realm, obviously.
[00:15:34.480 --> 00:15:38.440]   And the AC adapter, the 802.11 AC from Apple,
[00:15:38.440 --> 00:15:40.920]   more than twice as much as others.
[00:15:40.920 --> 00:15:42.800]   So it's hard to recommend it.
[00:15:42.800 --> 00:15:46.120]   Now, the same-- by the way, the same--
[00:15:46.120 --> 00:15:47.760]   as you said, Andy, easy.
[00:15:47.760 --> 00:15:49.040]   You just plug it in.
[00:15:49.040 --> 00:15:49.800]   It just works.
[00:15:49.800 --> 00:15:51.280]   In fact, there's not much you can really do.
[00:15:51.280 --> 00:15:53.320]   You just launch the airport utility.
[00:15:53.320 --> 00:15:54.680]   And there it is.
[00:15:54.680 --> 00:15:55.560]   149 bucks.
[00:15:55.560 --> 00:15:56.240]   That's not too bad.
[00:15:56.240 --> 00:15:57.480]   That's still less than an airport experience.
[00:15:57.480 --> 00:15:58.320]   That's Kickstarter price.
[00:15:58.320 --> 00:16:01.480]   But that's Kickstarter price.
[00:16:01.480 --> 00:16:04.640]   And I would say the same thing about the MacBook Air.
[00:16:04.640 --> 00:16:06.960]   And you correct me, Renee.
[00:16:06.960 --> 00:16:08.840]   I don't know, Mark, do you have the new MacBook Air?
[00:16:08.840 --> 00:16:09.360]   I don't know.
[00:16:09.360 --> 00:16:09.840]   Do you Andy?
[00:16:09.840 --> 00:16:10.840]   No, I don't.
[00:16:10.840 --> 00:16:12.080]   Andy, do you?
[00:16:12.080 --> 00:16:13.280]   Not yet, no.
[00:16:13.280 --> 00:16:14.840]   I got the feeling that that was the case
[00:16:14.840 --> 00:16:17.040]   when you begged for mine.
[00:16:17.040 --> 00:16:19.000]   No, no, no.
[00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:22.320]   I would have easily have asked for it to go to a worthy listener.
[00:16:22.320 --> 00:16:23.320]   Again, if it's teasing you--
[00:16:23.320 --> 00:16:23.520]   It's truly new.
[00:16:23.520 --> 00:16:24.600]   --better than the other one.
[00:16:24.600 --> 00:16:25.880]   No, no.
[00:16:25.880 --> 00:16:26.880]   I guess it last year.
[00:16:26.880 --> 00:16:29.160]   Last week, I know when you're teasing me.
[00:16:29.160 --> 00:16:31.400]   I just want to see if you have any shame about teasing me.
[00:16:31.400 --> 00:16:34.600]   No shame whatsoever about teasing me in that go.
[00:16:34.600 --> 00:16:37.520]   Please update Leo's lower third to say that Leo has no shame
[00:16:37.520 --> 00:16:38.760]   about teasing me.
[00:16:38.760 --> 00:16:39.680]   He's at the T's.
[00:16:39.680 --> 00:16:41.200]   He's at the T's.
[00:16:41.200 --> 00:16:44.200]   But my experience is I got the i7, the 8Gigs.
[00:16:44.200 --> 00:16:46.080]   I can't tell if it's faster or not.
[00:16:46.080 --> 00:16:48.280]   Can you-- I suppose a benchmark might.
[00:16:48.280 --> 00:16:49.120]   It doesn't--
[00:16:49.120 --> 00:16:50.800]   It wasn't-- they downclocked it.
[00:16:50.800 --> 00:16:52.960]   The CPU itself was not as fast as a previous generation.
[00:16:52.960 --> 00:16:55.240]   And it was never-- Apple didn't sell it as being faster.
[00:16:55.240 --> 00:16:56.840]   I mean, they were very careful in the presentation.
[00:16:56.840 --> 00:17:00.520]   They really advertised it as being the battery life machine.
[00:17:00.520 --> 00:17:03.160]   The MacBook Pro is clearly-- because the MacBook Pro 13,
[00:17:03.160 --> 00:17:05.360]   it's like we discussed-- there's no retina for the Air.
[00:17:05.360 --> 00:17:07.760]   If you want a retina error, you get the MacBook Pro 13.
[00:17:07.760 --> 00:17:10.680]   And that's going to be your big, beefy, fast workstation.
[00:17:10.680 --> 00:17:14.080]   The MacBook Air message is entirely about battery life
[00:17:14.080 --> 00:17:17.240]   and portability and being light and lasting forever.
[00:17:17.240 --> 00:17:20.080]   And that's only going to become more true with Maverick
[00:17:20.080 --> 00:17:22.920]   because-- Maverick's-- sorry, plural--
[00:17:22.920 --> 00:17:24.400]   because everything that they did there
[00:17:24.400 --> 00:17:26.000]   is going to really make that hardware.
[00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:28.720]   This is sort of like a pre-release T's for Mavericks
[00:17:28.720 --> 00:17:29.480]   in many ways.
[00:17:29.480 --> 00:17:33.160]   Yeah, this is-- if you already have a late model
[00:17:33.160 --> 00:17:34.600]   MacBook Air last two years, you probably
[00:17:34.600 --> 00:17:36.840]   wouldn't be worth it to do the--
[00:17:36.840 --> 00:17:38.880]   Unless you're on airplanes or live blogging a lot.
[00:17:38.880 --> 00:17:39.360]   A lot.
[00:17:39.360 --> 00:17:42.160]   Now, this is too early to do to tell a battery life.
[00:17:42.160 --> 00:17:44.000]   And those of you who saw the pre-show saw me
[00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:48.400]   looking for a battery life monitor on this thing
[00:17:48.400 --> 00:17:50.760]   to see how it goes.
[00:17:50.760 --> 00:17:54.080]   I have-- according to-- this is only the second full charge
[00:17:54.080 --> 00:17:57.920]   discharge because I only got it yesterday.
[00:17:57.920 --> 00:18:00.800]   It says about the third of my battery life remaining
[00:18:00.800 --> 00:18:03.600]   in about an hour, 39 minutes according to Apple.
[00:18:03.600 --> 00:18:06.800]   But I don't think it's had enough time to really calibrate
[00:18:06.800 --> 00:18:08.120]   all of that.
[00:18:08.120 --> 00:18:09.200]   And you'll often see it change.
[00:18:09.200 --> 00:18:10.800]   So if you're doing something graphically intensive--
[00:18:10.800 --> 00:18:12.880]   and unfortunately, a lot of apps use core animation
[00:18:12.880 --> 00:18:15.080]   just to do things like faster text rendering.
[00:18:15.080 --> 00:18:16.120]   And hopefully that'll change.
[00:18:16.120 --> 00:18:17.720]   But then the battery life will go down.
[00:18:17.720 --> 00:18:20.040]   And when you stop that activity, it'll go back up again.
[00:18:20.040 --> 00:18:22.760]   I was losing-- my heart was palpitating during the keynote
[00:18:22.760 --> 00:18:25.080]   because when I would engage aperture or something,
[00:18:25.080 --> 00:18:27.040]   the battery life would go to less than I needed.
[00:18:27.040 --> 00:18:27.800]   And then I turned it off.
[00:18:27.800 --> 00:18:29.680]   It would go way back more than I needed.
[00:18:29.680 --> 00:18:31.520]   And I never knew which one to trust.
[00:18:31.520 --> 00:18:33.520]   I would guess that you're going to get
[00:18:33.520 --> 00:18:37.480]   normal, heavy use, about six hours, not 12 hours.
[00:18:37.480 --> 00:18:39.240]   This is the 13-inch.
[00:18:39.240 --> 00:18:41.440]   It did promise 10 hours of video play, which is--
[00:18:41.440 --> 00:18:42.440]   Yeah, that's--
[00:18:42.440 --> 00:18:43.440]   --at like--
[00:18:43.440 --> 00:18:44.960]   That's not normal use.
[00:18:44.960 --> 00:18:46.160]   I mean, it's not typical use.
[00:18:46.160 --> 00:18:46.640]   Let's put it down.
[00:18:46.640 --> 00:18:48.800]   Well, but Apple's usually very conservative
[00:18:48.800 --> 00:18:51.960]   and usually spot on when they predict battery life.
[00:18:51.960 --> 00:18:54.080]   Every time I've tested a device, I rarely
[00:18:54.080 --> 00:18:57.240]   found it more than acceptable a range off.
[00:18:57.240 --> 00:18:59.920]   So if they were promising 12 and you get six,
[00:18:59.920 --> 00:19:02.960]   that would be a very, very weird thing.
[00:19:02.960 --> 00:19:06.040]   You'd have to be doing really intensive graphic stuff
[00:19:06.040 --> 00:19:08.800]   in order for that to happen with intensive networking
[00:19:08.800 --> 00:19:11.200]   for medium believe that it would do six.
[00:19:11.200 --> 00:19:14.120]   But I mean, it's OK that they don't talk about the speed
[00:19:14.120 --> 00:19:17.640]   increase, if any, because that really is the killer feature.
[00:19:17.640 --> 00:19:20.440]   Once you get over that barrier of you
[00:19:20.440 --> 00:19:22.720]   do not have to take your charger with you
[00:19:22.720 --> 00:19:24.440]   when you leave the house in the morning,
[00:19:24.440 --> 00:19:25.840]   because you will have enough juice to get you
[00:19:25.840 --> 00:19:28.640]   through the entire day, that is a killer feature.
[00:19:28.640 --> 00:19:31.960]   That's what brings, I think, the MacBook Air much, much more
[00:19:31.960 --> 00:19:34.520]   into the default Mac mode for so many people.
[00:19:34.520 --> 00:19:36.840]   And when they go into the Apple store,
[00:19:36.840 --> 00:19:37.960]   they want to buy a new laptop.
[00:19:37.960 --> 00:19:39.920]   They think they're going to get something that's big and heavy
[00:19:39.920 --> 00:19:42.200]   and thick and has ports and drives.
[00:19:42.200 --> 00:19:44.040]   As soon as you tell them this is the one we have,
[00:19:44.040 --> 00:19:46.440]   that will probably get you 12 hours over the course of the day.
[00:19:46.440 --> 00:19:47.960]   You will still have enough battery
[00:19:47.960 --> 00:19:49.920]   left to play games on the commuter rail
[00:19:49.920 --> 00:19:51.760]   for 45 minutes on your way home back to your car
[00:19:51.760 --> 00:19:53.480]   after the end of the workday.
[00:19:53.480 --> 00:19:57.240]   That's when you start thinking, maybe I do want an ultra compact,
[00:19:57.240 --> 00:19:59.440]   super slim device instead of a quote real,
[00:19:59.440 --> 00:20:01.880]   unquote desktop class machine.
[00:20:01.880 --> 00:20:02.960]   Yeah.
[00:20:02.960 --> 00:20:05.600]   So would you say it's fair to say you'll get twice as much
[00:20:05.600 --> 00:20:06.880]   as you used to get?
[00:20:06.880 --> 00:20:09.200]   Intel's only claiming 50% on as well.
[00:20:09.200 --> 00:20:11.360]   No, no, I wouldn't say twice as much.
[00:20:11.360 --> 00:20:14.680]   But I'm saying that for me, I was, like I've said before,
[00:20:14.680 --> 00:20:18.760]   I was so tempted by the 11 inch air last year or so.
[00:20:18.760 --> 00:20:22.600]   But one of the reasons why I said no was that, well,
[00:20:22.600 --> 00:20:25.320]   the battery life is good, but it's not, again,
[00:20:25.320 --> 00:20:27.400]   I leave the house in the morning without a power adapter.
[00:20:27.400 --> 00:20:30.560]   I come home after having had a full day with this machine.
[00:20:30.560 --> 00:20:32.480]   It was just below that threshold.
[00:20:32.480 --> 00:20:34.360]   The thing was about four or five hours.
[00:20:34.360 --> 00:20:36.880]   But now that you have that full day sort of effective
[00:20:36.880 --> 00:20:38.800]   around the 11 inch, that really makes it
[00:20:38.800 --> 00:20:39.840]   a much more credible machine.
[00:20:39.840 --> 00:20:43.160]   And it's not just, and for those who are going to be saying,
[00:20:43.160 --> 00:20:45.440]   well, I don't necessarily go out and use my computer
[00:20:45.440 --> 00:20:46.960]   for 10 or 12 hours a day.
[00:20:46.960 --> 00:20:50.120]   Yeah, but maybe you come home and you leave it in your bag
[00:20:50.120 --> 00:20:52.320]   in the hallway and you don't plug it back in your charger.
[00:20:52.320 --> 00:20:54.520]   Isn't it nice that the next day you still have six hours
[00:20:54.520 --> 00:20:55.720]   of battery left?
[00:20:55.720 --> 00:20:58.640]   Apple, I think it's such a solid feature
[00:20:58.640 --> 00:21:01.160]   and such a user facing feature.
[00:21:01.160 --> 00:21:04.000]   I wouldn't say that it transforms and redefines the air,
[00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:06.000]   but man, does it make it more delectable?
[00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:08.520]   I guess all I would say is your mileage may vary.
[00:21:08.520 --> 00:21:11.760]   You know, people who test battery life typically
[00:21:11.760 --> 00:21:15.480]   will use some sort of automated system
[00:21:15.480 --> 00:21:18.400]   that I think does not really reflect how you're using it.
[00:21:18.400 --> 00:21:22.520]   So, you know, all you can say is you're going to get
[00:21:22.520 --> 00:21:25.240]   some percentage over what you would have gotten
[00:21:25.240 --> 00:21:28.040]   because presumably you're going to use it the same way you did.
[00:21:28.040 --> 00:21:30.560]   Would it be fair to say 50% more battery life?
[00:21:30.560 --> 00:21:32.560]   If it makes a difference, we're going to be our battery test
[00:21:32.560 --> 00:21:33.880]   consists of coffee shops.
[00:21:33.880 --> 00:21:35.480]   So, we'll be doing a lot of new work.
[00:21:35.480 --> 00:21:37.000]   Yeah, and it's way too early.
[00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:38.480]   I mean, I'll come back next week and I'll give you
[00:21:38.480 --> 00:21:40.680]   a much better idea because it's only been through one cycle.
[00:21:40.680 --> 00:21:46.240]   But yeah.
[00:21:46.240 --> 00:21:47.520]   My experience like--
[00:21:47.520 --> 00:21:48.040]   Oh, go ahead.
[00:21:48.040 --> 00:21:49.520]   I'm sorry, go ahead.
[00:21:49.520 --> 00:21:50.440]   Mark.
[00:21:50.440 --> 00:21:52.640]   In my experience, like Apple's battery test
[00:21:52.640 --> 00:21:54.520]   for like the laptops, at least, you know,
[00:21:54.520 --> 00:21:56.560]   they never really lived up to what they claimed.
[00:21:56.560 --> 00:22:00.520]   I have the Retina 15-inch Pro and they claim seven hours
[00:22:00.520 --> 00:22:01.880]   and, you know, I get--
[00:22:01.880 --> 00:22:03.320]   That wasn't even close.
[00:22:03.320 --> 00:22:05.280]   Three to five at most.
[00:22:05.280 --> 00:22:07.880]   And like the only Apple product that I can honestly
[00:22:07.880 --> 00:22:09.640]   agree with Apple's claims for battery life
[00:22:09.640 --> 00:22:10.400]   would be the iPad.
[00:22:10.400 --> 00:22:11.400]   It's like those are--
[00:22:11.400 --> 00:22:12.480]   Yeah, those are right on.
[00:22:12.480 --> 00:22:13.000]   Yeah.
[00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:16.440]   So, you know, I don't know, maybe the errors are, you know,
[00:22:16.440 --> 00:22:18.520]   maybe they're more correct about that.
[00:22:18.520 --> 00:22:19.120]   We'll see.
[00:22:19.120 --> 00:22:22.080]   And it'll also be interesting to see what
[00:22:22.080 --> 00:22:23.040]   happens with Mavericks.
[00:22:23.040 --> 00:22:25.720]   Like someone should do some battery tests comparing
[00:22:25.720 --> 00:22:28.480]   a mountain lion, pneumacal care versus a pneumacal care
[00:22:28.480 --> 00:22:30.120]   running Mavericks.
[00:22:30.120 --> 00:22:32.080]   But the new, you know, app nap and all that.
[00:22:32.080 --> 00:22:33.520]   That should make a big difference.
[00:22:33.520 --> 00:22:36.280]   By the way, the power nap is disabled by default
[00:22:36.280 --> 00:22:38.960]   in the energy saver.
[00:22:38.960 --> 00:22:39.560]   For the new air?
[00:22:39.560 --> 00:22:42.040]   For the new air.
[00:22:42.040 --> 00:22:43.560]   So I checked it and turned it on.
[00:22:43.560 --> 00:22:46.680]   Somebody in the chat room is saying that I shouldn't be using
[00:22:46.680 --> 00:22:47.080]   Chrome.
[00:22:47.080 --> 00:22:49.200]   The Chrome is a notorious battery hag hog.
[00:22:49.200 --> 00:22:50.120]   And I guess that's fair.
[00:22:50.120 --> 00:22:51.400]   I mean, I should probably use Safari.
[00:22:51.400 --> 00:22:53.320]   It's one of the apps that just turns on everything
[00:22:53.320 --> 00:22:54.320]   all the time that it's on.
[00:22:54.320 --> 00:22:54.760]   So that'll--
[00:22:54.760 --> 00:22:55.960]   Well, let me turn it off then.
[00:22:55.960 --> 00:22:56.800]   That's not a good thing.
[00:22:56.800 --> 00:22:58.160]   Like, to Mark's point, one of the things
[00:22:58.160 --> 00:23:00.080]   that makes measuring Mac battery life more challenging
[00:23:00.080 --> 00:23:02.440]   than iPad is because the iPad has such a controlled environment
[00:23:02.440 --> 00:23:04.760]   that you're pretty much using it the same way Apple did.
[00:23:04.760 --> 00:23:06.800]   But if you're installing a lot of kernel extensions,
[00:23:06.800 --> 00:23:09.520]   if you're using apps that turn on things like coronamation,
[00:23:09.520 --> 00:23:11.840]   it's much harder to see what kind of real world usage
[00:23:11.840 --> 00:23:14.280]   you're getting because there's so much variety
[00:23:14.280 --> 00:23:16.200]   that you can be running on that machine.
[00:23:16.200 --> 00:23:18.000]   I was like, I've found that I was about running the whole time.
[00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:19.440]   It's not going to get that battery.
[00:23:19.440 --> 00:23:21.280]   Yeah, that's the real truth is your mileage
[00:23:21.280 --> 00:23:24.840]   may vary quite a bit because everybody uses it differently.
[00:23:24.840 --> 00:23:29.040]   I tend to test it in more of a like Microsoft Office type
[00:23:29.040 --> 00:23:32.120]   of apps, personal sort of media apps.
[00:23:32.120 --> 00:23:34.080]   Usually when I do a battery check,
[00:23:34.080 --> 00:23:37.520]   it's within about an hour of what Apple promises.
[00:23:37.520 --> 00:23:40.480]   So on the retina, I think was off by an hour or a little bit
[00:23:40.480 --> 00:23:42.080]   more, but it wasn't as bad as that.
[00:23:42.080 --> 00:23:44.080]   But it just goes to show that this is the reason why we have
[00:23:44.080 --> 00:23:46.240]   so many people testing it in so many different ways.
[00:23:46.240 --> 00:23:48.960]   It's the only by reading two or three reviews of our product
[00:23:48.960 --> 00:23:51.600]   are you going to really get a good idea of what this thing can do?
[00:23:51.600 --> 00:23:52.000]   Well, I am--
[00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:52.480]   I can't.
[00:23:52.480 --> 00:23:54.200]   I am taking Chrome out of my--
[00:23:54.200 --> 00:23:57.080]   I'm going to make my default browser Safari.
[00:23:57.080 --> 00:23:58.680]   And we'll try it that way.
[00:23:58.680 --> 00:23:59.680]   It's a Safari.
[00:23:59.680 --> 00:24:00.120]   You do it.
[00:24:00.120 --> 00:24:01.120]   You do it.
[00:24:01.120 --> 00:24:03.760]   Yeah, it's a factor in how much battery
[00:24:03.760 --> 00:24:07.080]   is going to take you to restart your computer three times a day.
[00:24:07.080 --> 00:24:09.360]   So it's kind of a trade-off.
[00:24:09.360 --> 00:24:11.720]   Really, do you find a lot of crashes as Safari?
[00:24:11.720 --> 00:24:12.160]   Oh, no.
[00:24:12.160 --> 00:24:15.800]   Just so many times when the entire platform just totally
[00:24:15.800 --> 00:24:16.640]   breaks itself.
[00:24:16.640 --> 00:24:19.240]   And I actually have an Apple script
[00:24:19.240 --> 00:24:23.400]   that does nothing more than harvests every URL from every open
[00:24:23.400 --> 00:24:26.240]   window in every tab and stashes it to an on the outliner
[00:24:26.240 --> 00:24:26.880]   file.
[00:24:26.880 --> 00:24:28.680]   It takes every file that's open.
[00:24:28.680 --> 00:24:29.680]   It's one of these things.
[00:24:29.680 --> 00:24:33.360]   It's like if I've got PDF open or JPEG open,
[00:24:33.360 --> 00:24:37.320]   save those to another directory, then close down everything,
[00:24:37.320 --> 00:24:39.280]   shut down Safari and restart it.
[00:24:39.280 --> 00:24:42.360]   Because the only way that I've managed to keep my MacBook
[00:24:42.360 --> 00:24:45.160]   15-inch Pro healthy is by just having
[00:24:45.160 --> 00:24:46.360]   that kind of discipline with Safari.
[00:24:46.360 --> 00:24:52.560]   Because it just will not allow you to be undisciplined in terms
[00:24:52.560 --> 00:24:54.440]   of keeping windows open that you're not using anymore.
[00:24:54.440 --> 00:24:57.480]   It's just Chrome is so much more reliable that way.
[00:24:57.480 --> 00:25:00.520]   Which is why I was so happy when they showed it during the keynote
[00:25:00.520 --> 00:25:02.040]   and they said that they were switching, for example,
[00:25:02.040 --> 00:25:04.520]   to a very Chrome-like multi-thread for Tab.
[00:25:04.520 --> 00:25:05.920]   A lot of the things that they announced here--
[00:25:05.920 --> 00:25:08.600]   I don't know if it was a back pedal or a side step or whatever.
[00:25:08.600 --> 00:25:09.800]   But it looks like the model they're
[00:25:09.800 --> 00:25:11.000]   doing for the next version of Safari
[00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:14.440]   is going to be so much better than the current one.
[00:25:14.440 --> 00:25:15.760]   Sorry, I'm changing to Safari.
[00:25:15.760 --> 00:25:19.840]   I have to log in.
[00:25:19.840 --> 00:25:21.520]   I'll send you my Apple script.
[00:25:21.520 --> 00:25:24.800]   I'm going to need an Apple script.
[00:25:24.800 --> 00:25:27.520]   So that's, I guess, very relevant,
[00:25:27.520 --> 00:25:29.480]   is that the apps you use.
[00:25:29.480 --> 00:25:30.960]   And I wish somebody would--
[00:25:30.960 --> 00:25:32.960]   so much attention has paid to this on smartphones,
[00:25:32.960 --> 00:25:35.200]   because it's such an issue.
[00:25:35.200 --> 00:25:36.720]   I would love to see more attention paid
[00:25:36.720 --> 00:25:41.280]   to how we maximize battery life on a MacBook Air.
[00:25:41.280 --> 00:25:43.120]   We're doing to do a lot of that, because for us,
[00:25:43.120 --> 00:25:44.720]   the MacBook Air is basically a mobile device.
[00:25:44.720 --> 00:25:45.200]   It's important.
[00:25:45.200 --> 00:25:46.800]   It's like, from an iPad, absolutely.
[00:25:46.800 --> 00:25:47.800]   Yeah.
[00:25:47.800 --> 00:25:50.480]   Yeah.
[00:25:50.480 --> 00:25:52.680]   So let me just-- oh, my god.
[00:25:52.680 --> 00:25:53.160]   Go away.
[00:25:53.160 --> 00:25:55.240]   Stop it.
[00:25:55.240 --> 00:25:55.640]   I don't know.
[00:25:55.640 --> 00:25:56.240]   Is this new?
[00:25:56.240 --> 00:25:58.480]   Apple wants, to me, to add all my accounts.
[00:25:58.480 --> 00:26:01.120]   It's also very mobile.
[00:26:01.120 --> 00:26:06.240]   And as soon as I log into Google, it says, oh, can I add?
[00:26:06.240 --> 00:26:08.200]   Can I sync up everything to Google?
[00:26:08.200 --> 00:26:10.680]   I don't remember doing that before.
[00:26:10.680 --> 00:26:11.680]   Is that new?
[00:26:11.680 --> 00:26:12.520]   They all want you, Leo.
[00:26:12.520 --> 00:26:13.720]   They all want every part of you.
[00:26:13.720 --> 00:26:14.480]   Yeah.
[00:26:14.480 --> 00:26:15.120]   I think that's new.
[00:26:15.120 --> 00:26:19.200]   And there's now a very mobile phone-like control
[00:26:19.200 --> 00:26:22.640]   panel accounts thing where you can log into all
[00:26:22.640 --> 00:26:25.560]   of your different accounts and so forth.
[00:26:25.560 --> 00:26:27.960]   It's the mail contacts calendars now.
[00:26:27.960 --> 00:26:31.200]   It says, which accounts would you like to add?
[00:26:31.200 --> 00:26:36.040]   And that's where they've added Vimeo and Flickr and AOL.
[00:26:36.040 --> 00:26:36.720]   Same thing.
[00:26:36.720 --> 00:26:37.880]   I mean, it's convenient to have that.
[00:26:37.880 --> 00:26:38.680]   It's very mobile phone-like.
[00:26:38.680 --> 00:26:40.760]   Anyway, my point, which--
[00:26:40.760 --> 00:26:46.160]   and I do have one-- was that you probably
[00:26:46.160 --> 00:26:47.600]   don't need to upgrade to this, either,
[00:26:47.600 --> 00:26:48.960]   except for the battery life.
[00:26:48.960 --> 00:26:51.120]   I don't see noticeable differences in speed.
[00:26:51.120 --> 00:26:53.480]   And I have to say-- and I know I'm
[00:26:53.480 --> 00:26:54.800]   broken record on this one--
[00:26:54.800 --> 00:26:55.880]   I miss retina.
[00:26:55.880 --> 00:26:57.120]   I miss it badly.
[00:26:57.120 --> 00:26:59.080]   Are the big pixels scraping your eyeballs, Leo?
[00:26:59.080 --> 00:27:01.240]   You're hurting my eyeballs.
[00:27:01.240 --> 00:27:02.880]   Once you've been using retina for a while,
[00:27:02.880 --> 00:27:05.200]   it's funny, until you use it, you don't notice.
[00:27:05.200 --> 00:27:06.280]   But now everything's retina.
[00:27:06.280 --> 00:27:09.760]   Even my Windows machines are 1080p now at this size.
[00:27:09.760 --> 00:27:15.320]   And that means you're going to notice.
[00:27:15.320 --> 00:27:19.320]   You see a little bit of a jaggy and that kind of thing.
[00:27:19.320 --> 00:27:20.360]   Just bugs me a little bit.
[00:27:20.360 --> 00:27:22.880]   This is the iPad mini of computers,
[00:27:22.880 --> 00:27:24.800]   where they sacrificed everything for the battery life.
[00:27:24.800 --> 00:27:25.320]   But--
[00:27:25.320 --> 00:27:25.800]   At the side.
[00:27:25.800 --> 00:27:26.320]   --it's fat.
[00:27:26.320 --> 00:27:28.480]   I mean, in the sense that I can do the thing that I do all
[00:27:28.480 --> 00:27:30.280]   the time-- and you and I have talked about this
[00:27:30.280 --> 00:27:32.400]   for an day before-- which is go full screen on apps,
[00:27:32.400 --> 00:27:36.080]   and then swipe back and forth.
[00:27:36.080 --> 00:27:37.720]   No-- you could show that.
[00:27:37.720 --> 00:27:38.760]   No hesitation at all.
[00:27:38.760 --> 00:27:41.320]   Just boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[00:27:41.320 --> 00:27:43.840]   Game designers will tell you that programming for the iPad
[00:27:43.840 --> 00:27:46.120]   2 and the iPad mini is the best experience.
[00:27:46.120 --> 00:27:47.280]   The iPad 3 is horrible.
[00:27:47.280 --> 00:27:48.880]   The iPad 4 is OK.
[00:27:48.880 --> 00:27:50.280]   But the non-retina devices are still
[00:27:50.280 --> 00:27:51.200]   where all the women's are.
[00:27:51.200 --> 00:27:53.760]   It's just not moving as many pixels.
[00:27:53.760 --> 00:27:54.520]   So--
[00:27:54.520 --> 00:27:55.480]   Max.
[00:27:55.480 --> 00:28:00.000]   And I had an SSD before, so that's not--
[00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:01.760]   It's fine.
[00:28:01.760 --> 00:28:03.640]   It's fine.
[00:28:03.640 --> 00:28:06.680]   Just like the airport extreme, don't run out and get it
[00:28:06.680 --> 00:28:08.280]   just because you want the latest, greatest thing.
[00:28:08.280 --> 00:28:09.880]   I don't think you're going to notice a difference.
[00:28:09.880 --> 00:28:12.120]   And you might really consider the base model
[00:28:12.120 --> 00:28:12.960]   to save a little money.
[00:28:12.960 --> 00:28:15.280]   I don't know if you gain more going from 4 to 8 gigabytes
[00:28:15.280 --> 00:28:17.120]   of RAM.
[00:28:17.120 --> 00:28:19.520]   I'm just worried about what software comes out next year.
[00:28:19.520 --> 00:28:21.320]   That's really going to want that data.
[00:28:21.320 --> 00:28:24.040]   Like I said, there are third party ways.
[00:28:24.040 --> 00:28:26.400]   You can upgrade the SSD on an error.
[00:28:26.400 --> 00:28:28.720]   It's not easy, but you can at least do that.
[00:28:28.720 --> 00:28:29.920]   And there are solutions.
[00:28:29.920 --> 00:28:32.600]   You can plug in an external SSD or an external hard drive.
[00:28:32.600 --> 00:28:35.280]   Whereas internal memory, once you realize
[00:28:35.280 --> 00:28:37.920]   that the reason why you're seeing the beach ball of death
[00:28:37.920 --> 00:28:39.760]   is because you just don't have enough RAM for the thing
[00:28:39.760 --> 00:28:41.400]   that you want to do or the new version of the operating
[00:28:41.400 --> 00:28:42.960]   system you want to run.
[00:28:42.960 --> 00:28:43.920]   You're on a lock.
[00:28:43.920 --> 00:28:47.440]   You just got to drop it in the shredder.
[00:28:47.440 --> 00:28:49.240]   Stage a home invasion, get the insurance money
[00:28:49.240 --> 00:28:50.200]   and buy something brand new.
[00:28:50.200 --> 00:28:51.720]   That's the only way you can upgrade an error.
[00:28:51.720 --> 00:28:53.040]   I mean, the one thing to add is that if you've
[00:28:53.040 --> 00:28:55.720]   been waiting for Haswell, you'll be happy that you waited.
[00:28:55.720 --> 00:28:57.520]   And the price is even a little bit cheaper
[00:28:57.520 --> 00:28:58.560]   on the higher end models.
[00:28:58.560 --> 00:29:00.160]   So you get the double benefit.
[00:29:00.160 --> 00:29:01.000]   Yeah.
[00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:03.920]   Every other year, every other generation of Intel processors
[00:29:03.920 --> 00:29:07.400]   is just brings so much that you get for free,
[00:29:07.400 --> 00:29:09.160]   where you don't have to redesign an entire computer
[00:29:09.160 --> 00:29:09.760]   around it.
[00:29:09.760 --> 00:29:10.480]   It seems.
[00:29:10.480 --> 00:29:13.320]   It's just that, oh, so this magically has better video
[00:29:13.320 --> 00:29:16.320]   and magically runs faster and magically gets better,
[00:29:16.320 --> 00:29:17.240]   better, better life.
[00:29:17.240 --> 00:29:18.320]   That's not as easy as that.
[00:29:18.320 --> 00:29:22.120]   But it's not-- it's not as bold as--
[00:29:22.120 --> 00:29:24.440]   this is a brand new display with retina graphics.
[00:29:24.440 --> 00:29:26.400]   It's no-- some of many things I just
[00:29:26.400 --> 00:29:27.600]   thought were pain in the butt about this
[00:29:27.600 --> 00:29:29.280]   are no longer a pain in the butt.
[00:29:29.280 --> 00:29:29.720]   Is that nice?
[00:29:29.720 --> 00:29:31.280]   Well, it's interesting to see what Haswell does
[00:29:31.280 --> 00:29:34.480]   for the retina MacBook Pros.
[00:29:34.480 --> 00:29:37.360]   This was one of the first times the MacBook Air
[00:29:37.360 --> 00:29:40.680]   is leap to the MacBook Pro in terms of the chip specs.
[00:29:40.680 --> 00:29:43.800]   So the MacBook Pro has now been obsolete in terms
[00:29:43.800 --> 00:29:45.560]   of processor by the Air.
[00:29:45.560 --> 00:29:46.520]   So I don't know.
[00:29:46.520 --> 00:29:48.360]   It'll be interesting to see if the battery life improves
[00:29:48.360 --> 00:29:51.400]   on the retina when they get Haswell eventually.
[00:29:51.400 --> 00:29:51.920]   All right.
[00:29:51.920 --> 00:29:54.920]   I got a question for Mark and Renee and Andy.
[00:29:54.920 --> 00:29:56.240]   Just help me, OK?
[00:29:56.240 --> 00:29:57.800]   This is one of the reasons I do these shows
[00:29:57.800 --> 00:30:00.240]   so I can get some help.
[00:30:00.240 --> 00:30:01.600]   One of the things I like to do when
[00:30:01.600 --> 00:30:03.320]   I go full screen on these things is
[00:30:03.320 --> 00:30:06.440]   to lock apps to a particular desktop.
[00:30:06.440 --> 00:30:09.000]   I have to say this-- because of the full screen spaces
[00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:10.920]   is now suddenly very useful.
[00:30:10.920 --> 00:30:12.600]   I have multiple desktops.
[00:30:12.600 --> 00:30:15.280]   And I lock stuff to different desktops.
[00:30:15.280 --> 00:30:18.160]   So I have Safari locked to-- well, in fact,
[00:30:18.160 --> 00:30:21.360]   it's time to lock Safari to this desktop.
[00:30:21.360 --> 00:30:25.080]   So I right click on the Safari icon options.
[00:30:25.080 --> 00:30:28.360]   And I don't see that feature.
[00:30:28.360 --> 00:30:32.360]   And yet I do, if I go to Mail, I do.
[00:30:32.360 --> 00:30:35.840]   So can you explain to me why some apps allow me to lock
[00:30:35.840 --> 00:30:38.160]   to the desktop and some don't?
[00:30:38.160 --> 00:30:38.920]   Why that option?
[00:30:38.920 --> 00:30:41.360]   See, I can't-- I could say iTunes should always
[00:30:41.360 --> 00:30:43.840]   open on this desktop.
[00:30:43.840 --> 00:30:47.160]   They might know that, but I can't do it with iChat.
[00:30:47.160 --> 00:30:49.480]   Well, I know there's a setting in Mission Control
[00:30:49.480 --> 00:30:52.040]   that you can turn off rearranging spaces most--
[00:30:52.040 --> 00:30:53.640]   Yeah, I do turn it off.
[00:30:53.640 --> 00:30:56.760]   I have it-- the spaces don't move based on usage.
[00:30:56.760 --> 00:30:58.880]   Perhaps because it only works for the full screen apps,
[00:30:58.880 --> 00:31:00.640]   like iChat, it's not full screen.
[00:31:00.640 --> 00:31:01.640]   No, this one's full screen.
[00:31:01.640 --> 00:31:02.160]   XChat.
[00:31:02.160 --> 00:31:05.200]   I vaguely remember them turning it off for Safari
[00:31:05.200 --> 00:31:07.480]   because people complained that they wanted to have Safari
[00:31:07.480 --> 00:31:09.000]   on multiple desktops.
[00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:10.760]   Because it was one of the apps that they wanted to have
[00:31:10.760 --> 00:31:11.120]   everywhere.
[00:31:11.120 --> 00:31:12.920]   Don't turn it off.
[00:31:12.920 --> 00:31:15.480]   Just let somebody not do that.
[00:31:15.480 --> 00:31:17.160]   But also, multiple displays are really going to change.
[00:31:17.160 --> 00:31:21.600]   Safari, no, I can lock Safari to a desktop.
[00:31:21.600 --> 00:31:22.760]   Maybe it's something in the app.
[00:31:22.760 --> 00:31:23.680]   I don't know.
[00:31:23.680 --> 00:31:24.840]   It's very odd.
[00:31:24.840 --> 00:31:26.560]   And it's going to change a lot with Mavericks.
[00:31:26.560 --> 00:31:28.440]   The whole full screen, multiple monitor thing,
[00:31:28.440 --> 00:31:30.760]   is going to be all new and magical.
[00:31:30.760 --> 00:31:32.600]   All right, we'll talk some more about Mavericks
[00:31:32.600 --> 00:31:34.640]   and other stuff in just a bit.
[00:31:34.640 --> 00:31:35.920]   Oh, here's somebody's giving me.
[00:31:35.920 --> 00:31:38.760]   Dr. T is giving me a link to a--
[00:31:38.760 --> 00:31:42.400]   ooh, graphs, pretty graphs, mini battery logger.
[00:31:42.400 --> 00:31:44.200]   You complete me.
[00:31:44.200 --> 00:31:45.840]   I'll start running this today.
[00:31:45.840 --> 00:31:49.880]   Next week, we'll take a look at graphs of battery usage.
[00:31:49.880 --> 00:31:51.920]   And what I really want to know is the kind of thing
[00:31:51.920 --> 00:31:54.560]   that you see on a mobile phone, which app used all that juice?
[00:31:54.560 --> 00:31:56.440]   Because then I would say, oh, Chrome, problem.
[00:31:56.440 --> 00:31:58.840]   Don't use it, that kind of thing.
[00:31:58.840 --> 00:32:00.720]   We have a wiener.
[00:32:00.720 --> 00:32:01.800]   So let's celebrate.
[00:32:01.800 --> 00:32:03.600]   And then we'll get back with more Renee Riches here
[00:32:03.600 --> 00:32:06.200]   from iMore from 9 to 5 Mac.
[00:32:06.200 --> 00:32:08.840]   Mark Gurman, good to have you, Mark.
[00:32:08.840 --> 00:32:11.000]   And of course, Andy and not go from the Chicago Sun
[00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:15.520]   Times or show today brought to you by go to meeting.com,
[00:32:15.520 --> 00:32:18.040]   that great service that allows you to have meetings
[00:32:18.040 --> 00:32:22.240]   with colleagues, clients, prospects, all over the world.
[00:32:22.240 --> 00:32:23.400]   Nobody stays put anymore.
[00:32:23.400 --> 00:32:24.840]   That's why go to meeting is a great way
[00:32:24.840 --> 00:32:29.440]   to work face to face with anyone, anywhere.
[00:32:29.440 --> 00:32:31.200]   We got a 30-day free trial for you.
[00:32:31.200 --> 00:32:33.000]   And I'll show you how to do that in just a second.
[00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:35.120]   But let me tell you a little bit about the features you've got.
[00:32:35.120 --> 00:32:37.200]   People ask me this all the time.
[00:32:37.200 --> 00:32:40.360]   We've got HD video conferencing built into it.
[00:32:40.360 --> 00:32:41.680]   And so they say, why don't you guys
[00:32:41.680 --> 00:32:42.960]   instead of using Skype, you just go to meeting.
[00:32:42.960 --> 00:32:44.360]   We've talked with go to meeting about it.
[00:32:44.360 --> 00:32:45.920]   But it's windowed.
[00:32:45.920 --> 00:32:48.880]   And I wouldn't--
[00:32:48.880 --> 00:32:51.600]   we are going to use it, I think, for our programming show.
[00:32:51.600 --> 00:32:53.280]   Because what I want to have--
[00:32:53.280 --> 00:32:54.480]   go to meeting has screen sharing.
[00:32:54.480 --> 00:32:58.040]   So Father Robert Ballester, who's going to host that show,
[00:32:58.040 --> 00:32:59.640]   can-- you'll see his screen.
[00:32:59.640 --> 00:33:00.280]   You'll see him.
[00:33:00.280 --> 00:33:02.080]   And then he's going to show Shannon how to program.
[00:33:02.080 --> 00:33:03.320]   So you'll see them.
[00:33:03.320 --> 00:33:04.760]   I think it'll be perfect for that.
[00:33:04.760 --> 00:33:06.080]   It's what it's designed to do.
[00:33:06.080 --> 00:33:09.040]   Multiple people in a meeting, you see your meeting people.
[00:33:09.040 --> 00:33:10.240]   You see your page.
[00:33:10.240 --> 00:33:10.840]   You can share.
[00:33:10.840 --> 00:33:11.400]   They can share.
[00:33:11.400 --> 00:33:12.640]   You can pass it back and forth.
[00:33:12.640 --> 00:33:14.040]   You can even present from an iPad.
[00:33:14.040 --> 00:33:17.920]   So you can say, let me show you the graph on my iPad here.
[00:33:17.920 --> 00:33:20.520]   And you can-- I mean, it's amazing.
[00:33:20.520 --> 00:33:22.160]   And it uses the camera on the iPad.
[00:33:22.160 --> 00:33:24.640]   It uses the camera on your laptop with the new HD cameras.
[00:33:24.640 --> 00:33:25.440]   You're going to look great.
[00:33:25.440 --> 00:33:26.360]   Everybody's going to look great.
[00:33:26.360 --> 00:33:28.600]   And it's going to be better than meeting in person.
[00:33:28.600 --> 00:33:30.080]   Because it's faster, more effective.
[00:33:30.080 --> 00:33:31.920]   Go to meeting.com.
[00:33:31.920 --> 00:33:34.680]   Click the orange try a free button and use R off our code.
[00:33:34.680 --> 00:33:37.280]   Mac break, you can try it free for 30 days.
[00:33:37.280 --> 00:33:40.440]   And I want to congratulate our winner.
[00:33:40.440 --> 00:33:42.160]   Because we gave away-- I don't know if you remember this--
[00:33:42.160 --> 00:33:47.880]   a lovely HD webcam so that somebody could use Go to Me
[00:33:47.880 --> 00:33:48.680]   with HD faces.
[00:33:48.680 --> 00:33:51.720]   We asked you if you would like to meet with anybody living
[00:33:51.720 --> 00:33:52.680]   or not famous.
[00:33:52.680 --> 00:33:55.320]   Who would it be and why?
[00:33:55.320 --> 00:33:58.400]   Our winner, Jonathan Cusick, who said,
[00:33:58.400 --> 00:34:02.040]   I would like to meet with Chris Hadfield
[00:34:02.040 --> 00:34:04.000]   to ask what was the biggest challenge he faced while
[00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:04.480]   in space.
[00:34:04.480 --> 00:34:06.320]   That would be fun.
[00:34:06.320 --> 00:34:10.040]   Commander Hadfield, of course, the commander of the ISS
[00:34:10.040 --> 00:34:12.760]   for a long time just came back a couple of weeks ago.
[00:34:12.760 --> 00:34:14.080]   Jonathan, congratulations.
[00:34:14.080 --> 00:34:15.920]   That camera's going out to you.
[00:34:15.920 --> 00:34:17.840]   And thank you for playing our little game.
[00:34:17.840 --> 00:34:21.600]   You don't have that tweet in front of you, Chad.
[00:34:21.600 --> 00:34:22.520]   Didn't they give you a link?
[00:34:22.520 --> 00:34:28.160]   Yeah, that's all right.
[00:34:28.160 --> 00:34:29.480]   I'll show you some other time.
[00:34:29.480 --> 00:34:30.840]   Well, you know, we'll put it in after the fact.
[00:34:30.840 --> 00:34:34.440]   It'll magically appear right now in the edited version
[00:34:34.440 --> 00:34:35.000]   of the show.
[00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:36.320]   How about that?
[00:34:36.320 --> 00:34:37.520]   That's the power I have.
[00:34:37.520 --> 00:34:40.480]   Go to meeting.com, click the try it free button,
[00:34:40.480 --> 00:34:42.760]   and use the offer code MAC break.
[00:34:42.760 --> 00:34:43.960]   We thank them so much for their support.
[00:34:43.960 --> 00:34:46.480]   And for the contest, we'll do more, I'm sure,
[00:34:46.480 --> 00:34:50.600]   giving away more stuff.
[00:34:50.600 --> 00:34:54.760]   Leo Le Porte here with our talented crew.
[00:34:54.760 --> 00:35:01.800]   We've talked a little bit about the hardware launched at WWDC.
[00:35:01.800 --> 00:35:03.520]   And now let's talk a little bit about Mavericks.
[00:35:03.520 --> 00:35:09.240]   We're starting to see a little bit of stuff leak out of--
[00:35:09.240 --> 00:35:11.880]   I think some of this is leaking out of the developer
[00:35:11.880 --> 00:35:13.960]   presentations, right?
[00:35:13.960 --> 00:35:16.360]   How power savings works in Mavericks.
[00:35:16.360 --> 00:35:20.640]   I think getting Mavericks on it won't need to have Haswell,
[00:35:20.640 --> 00:35:24.040]   but it will benefit from Haswell, I would think, right?
[00:35:24.040 --> 00:35:24.400]   Correct.
[00:35:24.400 --> 00:35:25.280]   I think it's a bonus.
[00:35:25.280 --> 00:35:27.040]   It's like icing on the Haswell.
[00:35:27.040 --> 00:35:27.400]   Right.
[00:35:27.400 --> 00:35:30.360]   You get a bunch of really OS-level smarts
[00:35:30.360 --> 00:35:32.920]   that'll do everything it can to maximize the already great
[00:35:32.920 --> 00:35:34.840]   power savings that you get in Haswell.
[00:35:34.840 --> 00:35:36.160]   Yeah.
[00:35:36.160 --> 00:35:38.360]   So I look forward to that.
[00:35:38.360 --> 00:35:38.920]   What is that?
[00:35:38.920 --> 00:35:41.280]   Is that the fall that they say a specific time?
[00:35:41.280 --> 00:35:41.680]   This fall.
[00:35:41.680 --> 00:35:42.200]   Just fall.
[00:35:42.200 --> 00:35:43.200]   This fall.
[00:35:43.200 --> 00:35:45.600]   Which is interesting, because prior to releases
[00:35:45.600 --> 00:35:47.280]   were in the early summer.
[00:35:47.280 --> 00:35:48.200]   So--
[00:35:48.200 --> 00:35:49.200]   It's a nice thing.
[00:35:49.200 --> 00:35:51.040]   Why do in that year--
[00:35:51.040 --> 00:35:52.720]   They're busy, Mark.
[00:35:52.720 --> 00:35:53.220]   Yeah.
[00:35:53.220 --> 00:35:55.720]   I mean, it's interesting to see why they need to launch it
[00:35:55.720 --> 00:35:58.560]   simultaneously, I guess, with iOS 7.
[00:35:58.560 --> 00:36:00.800]   Maybe there is some unannounced stuff between the two
[00:36:00.800 --> 00:36:03.080]   operating systems that link together well.
[00:36:03.080 --> 00:36:06.040]   Because if you remember with Lion and Mountain Lion,
[00:36:06.040 --> 00:36:11.440]   they have their 10.7.0 and 10.0 releases in June and July.
[00:36:11.440 --> 00:36:14.600]   And then when iOS 5 and iOS 6 came out,
[00:36:14.600 --> 00:36:16.360]   both Lion and Mountain Lion got major updates
[00:36:16.360 --> 00:36:19.280]   to address some new integration and compatibility
[00:36:19.280 --> 00:36:20.560]   with the new iOS.
[00:36:20.560 --> 00:36:22.320]   So I guess they can get it all in one shot now.
[00:36:22.320 --> 00:36:23.320]   They do both in the fall.
[00:36:23.320 --> 00:36:28.440]   Mass will fall again in another quiet spring time.
[00:36:28.440 --> 00:36:28.940]   Right.
[00:36:28.940 --> 00:36:33.800]   Oh, I forgot to tell you, I got a Mac Pro.
[00:36:33.800 --> 00:36:34.280]   I've seen it.
[00:36:34.280 --> 00:36:34.920]   It's epic.
[00:36:34.920 --> 00:36:36.560]   It's kind of heavy.
[00:36:36.560 --> 00:36:38.840]   But it's smaller than you might think.
[00:36:38.840 --> 00:36:41.200]   And it's got the side--
[00:36:41.200 --> 00:36:44.760]   Handyman corner.
[00:36:44.760 --> 00:36:46.920]   I had Burke make this up, because this
[00:36:46.920 --> 00:36:51.760]   is roughly accurate, not exactly accurate to size.
[00:36:51.760 --> 00:36:54.120]   So I think that's one thing you can't tell when you look at that.
[00:36:54.120 --> 00:36:56.040]   And I know, Renee, you saw it.
[00:36:56.040 --> 00:36:58.640]   And you did two probably mark at the event.
[00:36:58.640 --> 00:37:00.320]   So you know, it's not big.
[00:37:00.320 --> 00:37:00.960]   You can't tell.
[00:37:00.960 --> 00:37:03.920]   It looks like it could be any size in the graphics on the website.
[00:37:03.920 --> 00:37:04.440]   I'm so many.
[00:37:04.440 --> 00:37:05.480]   But it's pretty pro.
[00:37:05.480 --> 00:37:07.400]   Yeah, it's pretty small.
[00:37:07.400 --> 00:37:08.520]   Is the tube the new cube?
[00:37:08.520 --> 00:37:09.960]   That's what I want to know.
[00:37:09.960 --> 00:37:13.280]   Oh, it's clearly the new cube.
[00:37:13.280 --> 00:37:16.520]   I was thinking that maybe just like if you
[00:37:16.520 --> 00:37:18.760]   wanted to disable a car, you stick a banana in the tailpipe.
[00:37:18.760 --> 00:37:20.400]   If you wanted to disable a new Mac Pro,
[00:37:20.400 --> 00:37:23.200]   you put an orange down the output.
[00:37:23.200 --> 00:37:24.120]   Yeah.
[00:37:24.120 --> 00:37:24.640]   Yeah.
[00:37:24.640 --> 00:37:26.560]   My question is, if you put something on top of it,
[00:37:26.560 --> 00:37:29.480]   is it going to kill the fan, or will it fly up into the air?
[00:37:29.480 --> 00:37:31.600]   How is the idea of dicing the whole thing?
[00:37:31.600 --> 00:37:34.880]   How big the fan-- depends how big the powerful the fan is.
[00:37:34.880 --> 00:37:38.040]   I predict that the worst consumer for this
[00:37:38.040 --> 00:37:39.640]   is the person who has cats in their office,
[00:37:39.640 --> 00:37:42.040]   because you know the cat's going to be sitting right on top of that.
[00:37:42.040 --> 00:37:45.400]   Well, but I've got a jet of warm air right up his butt.
[00:37:45.400 --> 00:37:46.920]   That's going to happen.
[00:37:46.920 --> 00:37:47.840]   I might sit on it.
[00:37:47.840 --> 00:37:48.960]   That sounds pretty appealing.
[00:37:48.960 --> 00:37:51.600]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:37:51.600 --> 00:37:53.160]   The problem is it's small, right?
[00:37:53.160 --> 00:37:56.280]   I think we've seen the edited pictures with a cat curled right up
[00:37:56.280 --> 00:37:57.040]   in there.
[00:37:57.040 --> 00:37:59.600]   It'll be a kitty, a kitten, a little tiny cat.
[00:37:59.600 --> 00:38:01.680]   You can't really get a big cat in there.
[00:38:01.680 --> 00:38:02.180]   Hamster.
[00:38:02.180 --> 00:38:02.680]   It's a nest.
[00:38:02.680 --> 00:38:03.180]   Hamster.
[00:38:03.180 --> 00:38:07.080]   It'd be great for a hamster or a small gerbil, a large gerbil,
[00:38:07.080 --> 00:38:10.720]   small hamster, guinea pig, it would work great for.
[00:38:10.720 --> 00:38:11.240]   Small snakes.
[00:38:11.240 --> 00:38:13.320]   Some kind of snakes.
[00:38:13.320 --> 00:38:14.480]   Snakes will like it.
[00:38:14.480 --> 00:38:17.240]   I think you're right.
[00:38:17.240 --> 00:38:20.000]   Anyway, we did this for fun, but it also kind of
[00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:23.400]   illustrates the size of this thing.
[00:38:23.400 --> 00:38:25.840]   You know, the thing to look out for in the next six months
[00:38:25.840 --> 00:38:30.880]   is a rush of Thunderbolt 2 appliances.
[00:38:30.880 --> 00:38:31.840]   That's top box.
[00:38:31.840 --> 00:38:35.240]   It's taken so long to get Thunderbolt stuff out.
[00:38:35.240 --> 00:38:39.400]   Like a few years, I wonder what's going to happen.
[00:38:39.400 --> 00:38:42.840]   Are they going to have Thunderbolt 2 stuff out in time for this Mac
[00:38:42.840 --> 00:38:44.520]   Pro?
[00:38:44.520 --> 00:38:46.080]   And there's six times six on there,
[00:38:46.080 --> 00:38:47.960]   and that can make for a really ugly desktop if you want to
[00:38:47.960 --> 00:38:48.480]   max it out.
[00:38:48.480 --> 00:38:50.000]   So it'd be nice to see if someone makes something that's
[00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:52.440]   actually well and beautifully designed to let you sort of
[00:38:52.440 --> 00:38:54.840]   pull things away from the box without making it look like
[00:38:54.840 --> 00:38:56.360]   something coming out of the Matrix.
[00:38:56.360 --> 00:38:59.400]   We don't know how much it's going to cost or how much
[00:38:59.400 --> 00:39:01.880]   these devices are, but I think it's--
[00:39:01.880 --> 00:39:03.800]   I've been calling it the Rich Man's Mac.
[00:39:03.800 --> 00:39:05.400]   I mean, it's not going to be cheap.
[00:39:05.400 --> 00:39:06.880]   Well, I wouldn't say Rich Man's Mac.
[00:39:06.880 --> 00:39:10.480]   It's more like it's the really expensive Mac you buy because
[00:39:10.480 --> 00:39:13.200]   you're willing to spend $4,000 to $5,000 to complete a
[00:39:13.200 --> 00:39:15.600]   contract that's going to pay you $50,000 to $60,000.
[00:39:15.600 --> 00:39:16.280]   Right.
[00:39:16.280 --> 00:39:20.760]   Yeah, it's really designed for the Pro, whose either boss is
[00:39:20.760 --> 00:39:22.520]   paying for it or whose client is paying for it.
[00:39:22.520 --> 00:39:31.200]   You're getting 12 though, right, Leo?
[00:39:31.200 --> 00:39:32.840]   Oh, we'll get them for everybody.
[00:39:32.840 --> 00:39:34.160]   It'll be all over the studio.
[00:39:34.160 --> 00:39:35.160]   From now on, both of us are--
[00:39:35.160 --> 00:39:36.640]   I hope everyone.
[00:39:36.640 --> 00:39:40.200]   It's either spend like $10 for one password, or you buy 10
[00:39:40.200 --> 00:39:42.560]   of these Mac Pros, just have it crack every password you
[00:39:42.560 --> 00:39:42.760]   forgot.
[00:39:42.760 --> 00:39:43.400]   There you go.
[00:39:43.400 --> 00:39:47.200]   It's saving me time.
[00:39:47.200 --> 00:39:47.800]   Eye radio.
[00:39:47.800 --> 00:39:52.880]   Only US, Australia, and--
[00:39:52.880 --> 00:39:55.600]   no, I'm sorry, US.
[00:39:55.600 --> 00:39:56.760]   I was looking at the Pandora.
[00:39:56.760 --> 00:39:59.280]   Pandora's US, Australia, and New Zealand, presumably Apple
[00:39:59.280 --> 00:40:01.400]   could make deals in those countries as well.
[00:40:01.400 --> 00:40:03.400]   iTunes match, they said, was going to be US only, and it
[00:40:03.400 --> 00:40:04.480]   spread rather quickly.
[00:40:04.480 --> 00:40:07.280]   If you talk to a lot of the radio programs, it's an
[00:40:07.280 --> 00:40:08.120]   absolute pain.
[00:40:08.120 --> 00:40:09.480]   Even getting into Canada was--
[00:40:09.480 --> 00:40:10.280]   Right.
[00:40:10.280 --> 00:40:11.000]   Took a long time.
[00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:11.400]   --on the task.
[00:40:11.400 --> 00:40:12.320]   Yeah.
[00:40:12.320 --> 00:40:14.360]   And we still don't have a lot of services here, so those
[00:40:14.360 --> 00:40:16.040]   kind of licenses are really hard to get.
[00:40:16.040 --> 00:40:18.760]   People get upset when we talk about this stuff, because
[00:40:18.760 --> 00:40:20.480]   they say, well, I don't have it.
[00:40:20.480 --> 00:40:22.240]   We don't have Amazon MP3 in Canada still.
[00:40:22.240 --> 00:40:24.440]   They promised it to us in 2008, and it's still not here.
[00:40:24.440 --> 00:40:26.520]   It must be a curcullian effort.
[00:40:26.520 --> 00:40:28.720]   But again, blame the music industry.
[00:40:28.720 --> 00:40:29.080]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:40:29.080 --> 00:40:31.000]   Don't blame these companies.
[00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:32.840]   They'd love to get it in there.
[00:40:32.840 --> 00:40:38.840]   Apple mentioned, though, that they have 575 million active
[00:40:38.840 --> 00:40:41.440]   iTunes accounts.
[00:40:41.440 --> 00:40:44.560]   Horace Deddyu, as usual, with his devotion to graphs and
[00:40:44.560 --> 00:40:47.920]   numbers, has made a graph of the growth of iTunes.
[00:40:47.920 --> 00:40:50.240]   Pretty steady, I wouldn't say exponential.
[00:40:50.240 --> 00:40:54.760]   Pretty linear growth, about half a million accounts a day.
[00:40:54.760 --> 00:40:58.720]   44% compounded annually for the bankers among us.
[00:40:58.720 --> 00:41:05.880]   But gross revenue per account seems to be dropping a
[00:41:05.880 --> 00:41:07.800]   little bit.
[00:41:07.800 --> 00:41:11.520]   Each of the current 575 million accounts generates about half
[00:41:11.520 --> 00:41:16.640]   the revenue of the 100 million accounts of 2009.
[00:41:16.640 --> 00:41:18.160]   All those free apps?
[00:41:18.160 --> 00:41:18.760]   Yeah.
[00:41:18.760 --> 00:41:22.200]   50% decline in revenues per account.
[00:41:22.200 --> 00:41:24.160]   But you're growing overall.
[00:41:24.160 --> 00:41:24.640]   Right.
[00:41:24.640 --> 00:41:28.200]   I think that in the report he was talking about how the
[00:41:28.200 --> 00:41:30.600]   fact that still a growing base means it's more than made up
[00:41:30.600 --> 00:41:31.440]   for that sort of thing.
[00:41:31.440 --> 00:41:35.560]   I think it really does speak to the changing character of the
[00:41:35.560 --> 00:41:39.440]   iPhone, the iTunes user, whereas the first generation was
[00:41:39.440 --> 00:41:41.240]   definitely going to be a lot more passionate and a lot more
[00:41:41.240 --> 00:41:44.440]   driven and consider their phone to be their iPhone to be
[00:41:44.440 --> 00:41:47.880]   something much, much more special than this current
[00:41:47.880 --> 00:41:51.440]   quarter's crop, for which the iPhone is the phone that they
[00:41:51.440 --> 00:41:53.960]   bought that they could have had a choice of two or three that
[00:41:53.960 --> 00:41:55.360]   were also very, very good.
[00:41:55.360 --> 00:41:57.320]   They bought this one because of what are the reasons they
[00:41:57.320 --> 00:41:57.640]   bought it.
[00:41:57.640 --> 00:41:59.680]   And they're not quite so motivated to keep, you know,
[00:41:59.680 --> 00:42:03.760]   chairing out with the latest apps and the latest movies and
[00:42:03.760 --> 00:42:04.760]   the latest whatever.
[00:42:04.760 --> 00:42:07.760]   It's just the device in their pocket they bought to serve the
[00:42:07.760 --> 00:42:09.280]   role of a phone for increasingly.
[00:42:09.280 --> 00:42:12.560]   Yeah.
[00:42:12.560 --> 00:42:14.280]   So is it cause for concern at all?
[00:42:14.280 --> 00:42:19.920]   Look at the final look at the final graph that Apple generates
[00:42:19.920 --> 00:42:22.400]   every quarter and tell me that Apple's facing a problem.
[00:42:22.400 --> 00:42:23.200]   They're making more money.
[00:42:23.200 --> 00:42:25.000]   But it's it's more.
[00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:28.960]   I mean, it's more of a I wouldn't say it's a problem, but it's
[00:42:28.960 --> 00:42:32.560]   just that it's it points to how the character of the Apple
[00:42:32.560 --> 00:42:35.520]   user is changing and has been changing over the past five
[00:42:35.520 --> 00:42:39.320]   years since iOS came out where I think the definitely I think
[00:42:39.320 --> 00:42:43.400]   that Apple users are still as a whole, the most motivated and
[00:42:43.400 --> 00:42:46.120]   the most passionate and the most loyal users that any tech
[00:42:46.120 --> 00:42:49.120]   company has, but that's starting to shift where you can't really
[00:42:49.120 --> 00:42:51.280]   count on that on a person by person basis.
[00:42:51.280 --> 00:42:54.560]   So it if it indicates anything, it means that Apple has to
[00:42:54.560 --> 00:42:56.080]   keep doing things like iOS seven.
[00:42:56.080 --> 00:42:59.520]   They have to keep doing things like all of the future
[00:42:59.520 --> 00:43:04.040]   hardware devices that are described by some of the
[00:43:04.040 --> 00:43:07.960]   technologies being being discussed in violation of NDA from
[00:43:07.960 --> 00:43:12.440]   WWDC that they can't simply count on selling the same
[00:43:12.440 --> 00:43:15.000]   upgrades to existing apps to the same base of people.
[00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:16.800]   It's but it's a good problem to have there.
[00:43:16.800 --> 00:43:20.160]   They're selling to a wider range of people and more people
[00:43:20.160 --> 00:43:21.880]   means a wider pool of money to dive into.
[00:43:21.880 --> 00:43:23.120]   So that's not a problem.
[00:43:23.120 --> 00:43:24.120]   Right.
[00:43:24.120 --> 00:43:25.120]   Sandy's point.
[00:43:25.120 --> 00:43:26.480]   I mean, having a small group of people that pay a lot and
[00:43:26.480 --> 00:43:28.240]   having a giant group of people that could they could
[00:43:28.240 --> 00:43:30.360]   potentially get more money out of cost of customer
[00:43:30.360 --> 00:43:32.320]   acquisition is usually much higher than customer
[00:43:32.320 --> 00:43:33.320]   attention.
[00:43:33.320 --> 00:43:35.920]   So as long as they have that pool always theoretically, they
[00:43:35.920 --> 00:43:38.400]   could get more money out of it.
[00:43:38.400 --> 00:43:40.840]   By the way, we've marked the sound that sound you heard was
[00:43:40.840 --> 00:43:44.640]   Mark Kerman's Skype connection dying and a bloody violent
[00:43:44.640 --> 00:43:46.640]   death and we haven't been able to get him back.
[00:43:46.640 --> 00:43:48.440]   So Apple got him.
[00:43:48.440 --> 00:43:49.440]   Can we?
[00:43:49.440 --> 00:43:53.240]   I think the next Arduino project for somebody either
[00:43:53.240 --> 00:43:55.600]   either at the brick house or maybe I'll just build and
[00:43:55.600 --> 00:43:59.080]   send it to you is I want like a like a warehouse style
[00:43:59.080 --> 00:44:02.920]   OSHA sign saying it has been x days since our last last
[00:44:02.920 --> 00:44:03.920]   last night back.
[00:44:03.920 --> 00:44:06.280]   And every time the crash you have to reset it.
[00:44:06.280 --> 00:44:07.280]   It would always be zero.
[00:44:07.280 --> 00:44:11.400]   Do I have to do I have to do I have to pay for more than one
[00:44:11.400 --> 00:44:14.400]   digit display or can we just.
[00:44:14.400 --> 00:44:19.800]   Are there any just out of curiosity?
[00:44:19.800 --> 00:44:20.880]   Are there any Thunderbolt two?
[00:44:20.880 --> 00:44:22.480]   There's nothing no Thunderbolt two anything.
[00:44:22.480 --> 00:44:23.480]   Is there?
[00:44:23.480 --> 00:44:24.480]   Nothing.
[00:44:24.480 --> 00:44:27.920]   I mean, I believe it or not.
[00:44:27.920 --> 00:44:30.920]   Usually like when when the first Thunderbolt announcement came
[00:44:30.920 --> 00:44:34.480]   out, it was months before I saw my first real thunderbolt
[00:44:34.480 --> 00:44:37.360]   product, but mine box was full of companies saying, hey,
[00:44:37.360 --> 00:44:40.280]   here's our plans for the sports Thunderbolt who will have this
[00:44:40.280 --> 00:44:42.680]   audio device who will have this video device will have this
[00:44:42.680 --> 00:44:44.760]   storage device this rate device.
[00:44:44.760 --> 00:44:48.800]   I haven't received a single thing about Thunderbolt two devices.
[00:44:48.800 --> 00:44:50.760]   I don't think that's necessarily a sign that it's going to
[00:44:50.760 --> 00:44:53.000]   that's that there are any problems adopting Thunderbolt.
[00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:57.440]   I think it more points to that Thunderbolt is a very specific
[00:44:57.440 --> 00:45:00.120]   technology for a very specific kind of user.
[00:45:00.120 --> 00:45:04.160]   I mean, USB 3.0 works great for 95% of everybody out there
[00:45:04.160 --> 00:45:08.080]   where they just want fast data transfer between a storage
[00:45:08.080 --> 00:45:12.680]   device and a CPU and having essentially an expansion
[00:45:12.680 --> 00:45:17.080]   bus to add CPUs to a machine are not anywhere on their list
[00:45:17.080 --> 00:45:17.600]   of problems.
[00:45:17.600 --> 00:45:20.000]   And that Thunderbolt two is designed to solve exactly
[00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:21.200]   that kind of problem.
[00:45:21.200 --> 00:45:22.920]   I think if we're honest about it, what we're all waiting
[00:45:22.920 --> 00:45:24.840]   for is the retina Thunderbolt display anyway.
[00:45:24.840 --> 00:45:27.120]   And that's not going to send us a press release.
[00:45:27.120 --> 00:45:28.120]   Right.
[00:45:28.120 --> 00:45:28.640]   Right.
[00:45:28.640 --> 00:45:29.160]   The four page right.
[00:45:29.160 --> 00:45:29.800]   The four case.
[00:45:29.800 --> 00:45:31.320]   Storage is important too, though.
[00:45:31.320 --> 00:45:31.600]   Yeah.
[00:45:31.600 --> 00:45:34.760]   I mean, you want that four K display that goes with this bullet,
[00:45:34.760 --> 00:45:37.600]   but storage is really important.
[00:45:37.600 --> 00:45:39.640]   High speed storage is really--
[00:45:39.640 --> 00:45:40.000]   Yeah.
[00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:42.120]   But it's sort of like what you were talking about earlier
[00:45:42.120 --> 00:45:45.720]   about having this box that can transact data at very, very
[00:45:45.720 --> 00:45:47.520]   fast speeds, but it's not a speed that you're really
[00:45:47.520 --> 00:45:50.080]   going to be able to appreciate or notice right now.
[00:45:50.080 --> 00:45:52.720]   And until people have those four K camcorders,
[00:45:52.720 --> 00:45:54.120]   they're not going to be able-- they're not
[00:45:54.120 --> 00:45:56.600]   going to be copying data at such heavy volumes
[00:45:56.600 --> 00:45:58.520]   that they can really notice between Thunderbolt
[00:45:58.520 --> 00:45:59.680]   and Thunderbolt two.
[00:45:59.680 --> 00:46:01.680]   They can definitely do that when they're backing up
[00:46:01.680 --> 00:46:03.720]   like a half terabyte or a full terabyte hard drive
[00:46:03.720 --> 00:46:04.440]   at this point.
[00:46:04.440 --> 00:46:08.160]   But even then, people are sort of trained not to click the button
[00:46:08.160 --> 00:46:10.600]   then lean back with a comic book and expect the thing to be
[00:46:10.600 --> 00:46:13.000]   done by the time they finish the comic book.
[00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:17.000]   It really still is a scheduled at 4 AM procedure.
[00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:18.800]   And when you wake up your computer in the morning,
[00:46:18.800 --> 00:46:20.280]   hopefully see that it's been finished.
[00:46:20.280 --> 00:46:22.440]   So it's not a user facing problem yet.
[00:46:22.440 --> 00:46:22.940]   Right.
[00:46:22.940 --> 00:46:25.440]   Yep.
[00:46:25.440 --> 00:46:27.320]   You know, what I did not do, and I should do,
[00:46:27.320 --> 00:46:31.840]   is test the speed of the SSD on here.
[00:46:31.840 --> 00:46:36.080]   As you probably remember, I installed a PCI 2 SSD
[00:46:36.080 --> 00:46:39.160]   on the old Mac Pro and got remarkable reading
[00:46:39.160 --> 00:46:40.520]   right speeds on that thing.
[00:46:40.520 --> 00:46:42.280]   Y'all, battleship size Mac Pro.
[00:46:42.280 --> 00:46:42.880]   Really great.
[00:46:42.880 --> 00:46:47.160]   So the new little one will have PCI 3
[00:46:47.160 --> 00:46:49.720]   should get some very good results from its SSD.
[00:46:49.720 --> 00:46:52.840]   Let me just-- oh, the SSD on this is pretty fast.
[00:46:52.840 --> 00:46:58.400]   Right speeds pegging the Blackmagic disk speed test.
[00:46:58.400 --> 00:47:01.720]   And these are excellent speeds.
[00:47:01.720 --> 00:47:02.600]   Wow.
[00:47:02.600 --> 00:47:06.960]   Best speeds I've-- these are as good as the PCI Express speeds.
[00:47:06.960 --> 00:47:08.520]   It's pegging it.
[00:47:08.520 --> 00:47:13.840]   It's 600 megabyte per second read, 700 megabyte--
[00:47:13.840 --> 00:47:17.720]   I'm sorry, right, 700 megabyte per second read.
[00:47:17.720 --> 00:47:18.960]   Wow.
[00:47:18.960 --> 00:47:19.840]   Future Leo.
[00:47:19.840 --> 00:47:20.200]   Wow.
[00:47:20.200 --> 00:47:22.680]   I wonder if that's has well or they're putting much better--
[00:47:22.680 --> 00:47:24.880]   they use those Samsung drives, right?
[00:47:24.880 --> 00:47:28.640]   Pretty fast.
[00:47:28.640 --> 00:47:30.320]   And the reason I launched it, Andy,
[00:47:30.320 --> 00:47:34.040]   I wanted to show you the reason Blackmagic makes this.
[00:47:34.040 --> 00:47:36.960]   Of course, they make hardware, including some thunderbolts--
[00:47:36.960 --> 00:47:39.640]   a lot of thunderbolts stuff for video editors.
[00:47:39.640 --> 00:47:42.640]   And what this test is designed for video editors
[00:47:42.640 --> 00:47:46.240]   to see if they can write in real time high quality video.
[00:47:46.240 --> 00:47:49.680]   So you scroll down, Chad, to the bottom there.
[00:47:49.680 --> 00:47:51.200]   You see all those check marks?
[00:47:51.200 --> 00:47:53.760]   They're showing, well, can you use-- which video formats
[00:47:53.760 --> 00:47:55.560]   can you write in real time?
[00:47:55.560 --> 00:48:00.320]   And this is fast enough to write very high quality video,
[00:48:00.320 --> 00:48:04.760]   all but 60 frame 1080p in real time.
[00:48:04.760 --> 00:48:05.240]   Wow.
[00:48:05.240 --> 00:48:07.280]   Thank you for that, really.
[00:48:07.280 --> 00:48:09.960]   So this is-- yeah, this is amazing.
[00:48:09.960 --> 00:48:12.320]   Presumably, you're going to get speeds at least this good
[00:48:12.320 --> 00:48:13.600]   on the new Mac Pro.
[00:48:13.600 --> 00:48:15.160]   So yeah.
[00:48:15.160 --> 00:48:16.560]   That is a significant-- I have to say,
[00:48:16.560 --> 00:48:19.720]   that is a significant difference over the old Mac book here.
[00:48:19.720 --> 00:48:22.040]   Like big time, like twice as fast.
[00:48:22.040 --> 00:48:22.480]   Yeah.
[00:48:22.480 --> 00:48:24.680]   And also, when you think about this was originally
[00:48:24.680 --> 00:48:28.640]   being sold as the stylish Mac, this
[00:48:28.640 --> 00:48:32.200]   is the elegant, like, elite modeling agency,
[00:48:32.200 --> 00:48:33.680]   like Clutch Handbag style one.
[00:48:33.680 --> 00:48:35.960]   And now this is-- nope, but as powerful as anything
[00:48:35.960 --> 00:48:37.200]   that you can possibly buy at this point.
[00:48:37.200 --> 00:48:37.480]   Yeah.
[00:48:37.480 --> 00:48:38.000]   OK.
[00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:38.000]   Fine.
[00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:39.000]   Great.
[00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:40.000]   Oh, you're--
[00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:41.000]   Oh, you're--
[00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:42.000]   --of the price tier is amazing.
[00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:42.500]   Yeah.
[00:48:42.500 --> 00:48:43.000]   Oh, yeah.
[00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:43.500]   Good heavens.
[00:48:43.500 --> 00:48:46.660]   The original era was pretty-- was a slug-ard.
[00:48:46.660 --> 00:48:47.160]   Yeah.
[00:48:47.160 --> 00:48:50.200]   It was the same with Apple.
[00:48:50.200 --> 00:48:52.740]   I don't know.
[00:48:52.740 --> 00:48:57.220]   It's not as though they always get things perfect,
[00:48:57.220 --> 00:48:59.300]   but they're always--
[00:48:59.300 --> 00:49:02.620]   in golfing terms, it's always a very, very solid tee shot
[00:49:02.620 --> 00:49:04.180]   that leaves them in the middle of the fairway
[00:49:04.180 --> 00:49:07.860]   with a short iron to get onto the green, at least.
[00:49:07.860 --> 00:49:10.380]   I can't think of another desktop in recent years
[00:49:10.380 --> 00:49:14.580]   that was as odd and as hard to recommend
[00:49:14.580 --> 00:49:15.700]   as the first MacBook Air.
[00:49:15.700 --> 00:49:17.060]   It wasn't just the speed.
[00:49:17.060 --> 00:49:20.500]   It wasn't just the fact that it kept channeling the fan
[00:49:20.500 --> 00:49:21.500]   every second.
[00:49:21.500 --> 00:49:25.420]   It was the fact that, oh, man, almost no storage space
[00:49:25.420 --> 00:49:28.100]   in a world that doesn't really have cloud storage
[00:49:28.100 --> 00:49:31.180]   and only one USB port so that you can't--
[00:49:31.180 --> 00:49:34.380]   just the idea of I have photos on a memory card
[00:49:34.380 --> 00:49:36.580]   that I want to work with.
[00:49:36.580 --> 00:49:40.300]   And so having to attach the camera
[00:49:40.300 --> 00:49:42.500]   to import a handful of these files
[00:49:42.500 --> 00:49:45.220]   onto whatever free space you have on the SSD,
[00:49:45.220 --> 00:49:48.260]   disconnect the camera, reconnect your hard drive,
[00:49:48.260 --> 00:49:49.780]   copy those files onto the hard drive,
[00:49:49.780 --> 00:49:50.780]   then disconnect the hard drive.
[00:49:50.780 --> 00:49:51.780]   Flop and swap these out.
[00:49:51.780 --> 00:49:52.420]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:49:52.420 --> 00:49:54.940]   It was like the Mac 128, like swapping disks
[00:49:54.940 --> 00:49:59.100]   because you got-- damn you, you made it to page 7
[00:49:59.100 --> 00:49:59.940]   of your term paper.
[00:49:59.940 --> 00:50:02.460]   And now that was more than the CPU could handle.
[00:50:02.460 --> 00:50:05.140]   Yeah, I just meant that whole cliche about skating
[00:50:05.140 --> 00:50:07.140]   to where the puck is going to be in the MacBook Air.
[00:50:07.140 --> 00:50:10.700]   You could kind of see the ultra small portable future.
[00:50:10.700 --> 00:50:11.980]   And now it's been a reality.
[00:50:11.980 --> 00:50:13.980]   And now we're looking at the Mac Pro and saying, well,
[00:50:13.980 --> 00:50:16.020]   it doesn't quite make sense for this, this, and that.
[00:50:16.020 --> 00:50:17.260]   But baby, in the three years from now,
[00:50:17.260 --> 00:50:19.740]   we'll be looking back and saying, wow, that makes a lot of sense
[00:50:19.740 --> 00:50:23.180]   for what that hardware can do and now in our use cases now.
[00:50:23.180 --> 00:50:23.980]   Well, I just want to--
[00:50:23.980 --> 00:50:24.540]   I think that--
[00:50:24.540 --> 00:50:25.340]   Go ahead.
[00:50:25.340 --> 00:50:29.860]   Just quickly, I think that sometimes that gets overused
[00:50:29.860 --> 00:50:30.460]   for Apple.
[00:50:30.460 --> 00:50:32.980]   And you could also tell them that the Newton message pad
[00:50:32.980 --> 00:50:35.220]   was the case of them skating where the puck was going to be.
[00:50:35.220 --> 00:50:37.380]   The problem is that if you drive so far--
[00:50:37.380 --> 00:50:40.860]   if you set up your lemonade stand so far out into the woods
[00:50:40.860 --> 00:50:43.100]   that you go out of business before,
[00:50:43.100 --> 00:50:46.460]   they finish building the road to your lemonade stand.
[00:50:46.460 --> 00:50:47.900]   It's interesting.
[00:50:47.900 --> 00:50:49.820]   They were definitely ahead of the curve.
[00:50:49.820 --> 00:50:51.420]   Maybe they were a little bit too ahead of the curve
[00:50:51.420 --> 00:50:51.980]   with the air.
[00:50:51.980 --> 00:50:55.100]   I feel sorry for anybody who bought it when it was $1,800
[00:50:55.100 --> 00:50:56.660]   for the first one that came out because that was--
[00:50:56.660 --> 00:50:58.020]   I was one of those, Andy.
[00:50:58.020 --> 00:50:59.340]   Oh, yeah, me too.
[00:50:59.340 --> 00:51:00.860]   But that's our job.
[00:51:00.860 --> 00:51:02.420]   You were doing research.
[00:51:02.420 --> 00:51:06.940]   Again, this week, I am going to New York to pick up
[00:51:06.940 --> 00:51:08.820]   a subtle Google Glass for which I'm paying
[00:51:08.820 --> 00:51:12.180]   an exorbitant amount of money, not because I think it'll
[00:51:12.180 --> 00:51:13.300]   be a make-up make-back.
[00:51:13.300 --> 00:51:15.020]   It's money, but because I'm a journalist
[00:51:15.020 --> 00:51:17.340]   and I want to write about this, and that is what I have to do.
[00:51:17.340 --> 00:51:20.620]   Thank God that we all have this ability to say, no, no.
[00:51:20.620 --> 00:51:22.260]   It wasn't because I felt as though I
[00:51:22.260 --> 00:51:25.060]   had to have this really cool shiny thing that was really cool
[00:51:25.060 --> 00:51:25.540]   and awesome.
[00:51:25.540 --> 00:51:27.100]   It's because I was doing research.
[00:51:27.100 --> 00:51:28.020]   That's what I was doing.
[00:51:28.020 --> 00:51:29.780]   That I'm not a stupid person at all.
[00:51:29.780 --> 00:51:34.780]   I've been running this disk speed test on this new air,
[00:51:34.780 --> 00:51:38.060]   and I have to compare it with the speed test that I ran on.
[00:51:38.060 --> 00:51:42.500]   This is the old Mac Pro with the PCI 2,
[00:51:42.500 --> 00:51:44.580]   other world computing mercury disk.
[00:51:44.580 --> 00:51:48.660]   It's faster on the air than it is on my Mac Pro.
[00:51:48.660 --> 00:51:49.580]   So I mean, like--
[00:51:49.580 --> 00:51:50.260]   How does that make you feel, Leo?
[00:51:50.260 --> 00:51:51.180]   Yeah.
[00:51:51.180 --> 00:51:53.820]   Like on the very expensively upgraded Mac Pro.
[00:51:53.820 --> 00:51:55.020]   So--
[00:51:55.020 --> 00:51:55.980]   Thank you, Leo.
[00:51:55.980 --> 00:51:56.780]   All right.
[00:51:56.780 --> 00:51:57.780]   Thank you for doing that for us.
[00:51:57.780 --> 00:52:00.460]   I'm now justifying-- I'm saying, OK, it's good.
[00:52:00.460 --> 00:52:02.980]   I'm downloading Cinebench right now.
[00:52:02.980 --> 00:52:06.100]   We'll see what kind of score we get on Cinebench as well.
[00:52:06.100 --> 00:52:08.420]   That needs to be-- this is going to be my Kickstarter campaign.
[00:52:08.420 --> 00:52:09.780]   It's going to make a million bucks,
[00:52:09.780 --> 00:52:11.740]   where if you are like one of these--
[00:52:11.740 --> 00:52:14.340]   like an on-site video editors who makes a lot of money
[00:52:14.340 --> 00:52:16.580]   by doing like professional video,
[00:52:16.580 --> 00:52:20.060]   it's just sort of like a big huge plastic ventilated fan-induced
[00:52:20.060 --> 00:52:22.500]   sled made out of this like rolled metal.
[00:52:22.500 --> 00:52:24.940]   You can insert your MacBook Air into it.
[00:52:24.940 --> 00:52:26.420]   So the people think that you have a really big--
[00:52:26.420 --> 00:52:27.420]   Oh, I'm here.
[00:52:27.420 --> 00:52:28.860]   You get a computer that you have, right?
[00:52:28.860 --> 00:52:29.780]   Yeah.
[00:52:29.780 --> 00:52:32.300]   Let me just-- I'm just-- why not?
[00:52:32.300 --> 00:52:35.420]   Let's just quickly run the CPU tests.
[00:52:35.420 --> 00:52:37.500]   And while we're doing that, we'll take a break
[00:52:37.500 --> 00:52:38.900]   and talk about Audible.com.
[00:52:38.900 --> 00:52:39.420]   We'll come back.
[00:52:39.420 --> 00:52:41.380]   I'll have the Cinebench results.
[00:52:41.380 --> 00:52:45.060]   This air is looking a lot faster than I thought.
[00:52:45.060 --> 00:52:47.500]   Pretty impressive, actually.
[00:52:47.500 --> 00:52:50.580]   Again, and this is the i7 version with 8 gigs of RAM,
[00:52:50.580 --> 00:52:54.620]   but the base 256 gigabyte SSD.
[00:52:54.620 --> 00:52:56.700]   It also just shows that CPU is not the only measure speed
[00:52:56.700 --> 00:52:57.220]   anymore.
[00:52:57.220 --> 00:53:00.060]   Yeah, well, IO has really been the gating factor
[00:53:00.060 --> 00:53:01.900]   for a long time.
[00:53:01.900 --> 00:53:03.980]   Didn't they say-- or no, they never said.
[00:53:03.980 --> 00:53:06.540]   But I think didn't people say that even though the clock speed
[00:53:06.540 --> 00:53:08.900]   is a little slower because it has well,
[00:53:08.900 --> 00:53:10.740]   you could expect performance comparable.
[00:53:10.740 --> 00:53:11.740]   Yeah.
[00:53:11.740 --> 00:53:12.340]   Absolutely.
[00:53:12.340 --> 00:53:12.780]   CPU performance.
[00:53:12.780 --> 00:53:14.460]   We'll see in just a second.
[00:53:14.460 --> 00:53:16.180]   We're running the CPU test.
[00:53:16.180 --> 00:53:18.620]   Cinebench CPU test from Maxon.
[00:53:18.620 --> 00:53:20.260]   Of course, I got about 80 other things
[00:53:20.260 --> 00:53:22.060]   running in the background.
[00:53:22.060 --> 00:53:23.780]   It's not exactly a pure test.
[00:53:23.780 --> 00:53:24.820]   Hey, we got Mark Gurman back.
[00:53:24.820 --> 00:53:27.100]   Mark, sorry about the Skype issue.
[00:53:27.100 --> 00:53:27.980]   Yeah, not sure what happened.
[00:53:27.980 --> 00:53:28.860]   My connection's good.
[00:53:28.860 --> 00:53:30.580]   It just kept dropping.
[00:53:30.580 --> 00:53:32.700]   Yeah, these things happen.
[00:53:32.700 --> 00:53:34.900]   But we switched lines and it looks good now.
[00:53:34.900 --> 00:53:35.780]   Good, good, good.
[00:53:35.780 --> 00:53:38.140]   We're going to take a break, talk about audible.com.
[00:53:38.140 --> 00:53:42.700]   If you are not yet familiar with Audible, my goodness gracious
[00:53:42.700 --> 00:53:48.100]   you ought to be more than 100,000 great books on audio,
[00:53:48.100 --> 00:53:53.260]   recorded by not some bored guy or putting in his day's work
[00:53:53.260 --> 00:53:59.300]   or a robot, but by really good voice actors who bring books to life.
[00:53:59.300 --> 00:54:03.340]   And anybody who's listening to Game of Thrones on Audible or any
[00:54:03.340 --> 00:54:05.500]   of the science fiction that we've recommended in the past,
[00:54:05.500 --> 00:54:07.220]   Peter F. Hamilton books on Audible,
[00:54:07.220 --> 00:54:09.340]   knows this stuff comes to life.
[00:54:09.340 --> 00:54:11.220]   I mean, really, all the Neil Gaiman stuff.
[00:54:11.220 --> 00:54:13.780]   In fact, Neil Gaiman reads some of his stuff, never
[00:54:13.780 --> 00:54:14.660]   where it's so good.
[00:54:14.660 --> 00:54:16.420]   There's so many great books on here.
[00:54:16.420 --> 00:54:21.300]   100,000 titles, fiction, nonfiction, periodicals, radio
[00:54:21.300 --> 00:54:24.380]   shows, you even get with a subscription,
[00:54:24.380 --> 00:54:26.020]   I'm going to tell you how you can get this for free in just a
[00:54:26.020 --> 00:54:29.900]   second, The Daily New York Times or Wall Street Journal Digest
[00:54:29.900 --> 00:54:31.420]   read to you, which is great.
[00:54:31.420 --> 00:54:33.740]   Look at all the great books now.
[00:54:33.740 --> 00:54:34.260]   Here's the deal.
[00:54:34.260 --> 00:54:36.580]   If you go to audible.com/macbreak, you'll
[00:54:36.580 --> 00:54:38.220]   be signing up for the gold account.
[00:54:38.220 --> 00:54:41.860]   That's the Book of Month account.
[00:54:41.860 --> 00:54:43.260]   And the first month's free.
[00:54:43.260 --> 00:54:45.740]   So the first book is free, first credit anyway, in almost all
[00:54:45.740 --> 00:54:50.500]   books, about 99.5% of all the books are a single credit books.
[00:54:50.500 --> 00:54:52.780]   So you can cancel the first 30 days, pay nothing, but that
[00:54:52.780 --> 00:54:54.980]   book will be yours to keep Andy and Naka.
[00:54:54.980 --> 00:54:57.580]   I always like to find out what Andy's listening to.
[00:54:57.580 --> 00:54:59.260]   What are you listening to today?
[00:54:59.260 --> 00:55:00.740]   Easy recommendation today.
[00:55:00.740 --> 00:55:03.020]   It's a book that I have not listened to, but I bought as
[00:55:03.020 --> 00:55:05.180]   soon as it was available, was on my wish list for months.
[00:55:05.180 --> 00:55:08.180]   The Ocean at the End of the Lane, Neil Gaiman's brand new
[00:55:08.180 --> 00:55:10.460]   book just comes out today.
[00:55:10.460 --> 00:55:11.940]   It's all the high marks.
[00:55:11.940 --> 00:55:13.580]   Well, first of all, almost anything that he puts out an
[00:55:13.580 --> 00:55:16.460]   audiobook is worth buying because, A, he is that kind of
[00:55:16.460 --> 00:55:16.820]   writer.
[00:55:16.820 --> 00:55:18.460]   And also, he narrates it himself.
[00:55:18.460 --> 00:55:22.860]   And he was certainly whatever he is reading, he reads
[00:55:22.860 --> 00:55:23.700]   exceptionally well.
[00:55:23.700 --> 00:55:25.660]   And so that earns a recommendation.
[00:55:25.660 --> 00:55:29.260]   Also, American Gods, there are a lot of people who love that
[00:55:29.260 --> 00:55:29.460]   book.
[00:55:29.460 --> 00:55:32.060]   It's not my favorite one because I have found that my
[00:55:32.060 --> 00:55:35.300]   favorite Neil Gaiman books are the shorter ones because I
[00:55:35.300 --> 00:55:36.380]   don't know how to describe it.
[00:55:36.380 --> 00:55:38.940]   It's sort of like you have to remember to drive on the
[00:55:38.940 --> 00:55:42.020]   left-hand side of the road in this story.
[00:55:42.020 --> 00:55:44.660]   And his style of writing, his style of storytelling.
[00:55:44.660 --> 00:55:48.060]   And so the really, really long novels, it's hard for me to
[00:55:48.060 --> 00:55:51.860]   remember that, oh, I should be in the right-hand lane if I
[00:55:51.860 --> 00:55:54.420]   want to take a left-hand lane, if I want to make an exit.
[00:55:54.420 --> 00:55:58.020]   As to me, it's a long time to spend inside that mindset.
[00:55:58.020 --> 00:55:58.820]   This is a shorter one.
[00:55:58.820 --> 00:56:01.460]   It's about 50-something-thousand words.
[00:56:01.460 --> 00:56:04.780]   And all the advanced reviews and all the interviews indicate
[00:56:04.780 --> 00:56:09.780]   that it's different from what he's written before.
[00:56:09.780 --> 00:56:11.020]   And that's a little bit more personal.
[00:56:11.020 --> 00:56:13.540]   It's not autobiographical in any way.
[00:56:13.540 --> 00:56:17.900]   But that Amanda Palmer's wife had a really long, but
[00:56:17.900 --> 00:56:21.100]   really cool blog post I think today or yesterday about
[00:56:21.100 --> 00:56:24.700]   reading it and knowing Neil and about how it's sort of like,
[00:56:24.700 --> 00:56:27.820]   you could see a lot more of him in this book and his story
[00:56:27.820 --> 00:56:30.300]   and his experiences in this book than in any other book
[00:56:30.300 --> 00:56:31.100]   that he's ever done.
[00:56:31.100 --> 00:56:35.220]   She likened it to, as an artist, you put your ingredients,
[00:56:35.220 --> 00:56:37.420]   like your experiences, your own personal experiences into a
[00:56:37.420 --> 00:56:41.700]   blender that Neil normally then pushes the 10 button and it
[00:56:41.700 --> 00:56:44.700]   gets ground up so finally you can't see any of the origins
[00:56:44.700 --> 00:56:46.420]   of any of the ingredients he put in there.
[00:56:46.420 --> 00:56:48.780]   And this is like the blender set on a much lower setting so
[00:56:48.780 --> 00:56:50.340]   you can say, "Oh, I see where that came from."
[00:56:50.340 --> 00:56:52.460]   "Oh, I see that aspect of his personality."
[00:56:52.460 --> 00:56:54.340]   I see, "Oh, that's from this thing."
[00:56:54.340 --> 00:56:56.260]   So I'm truly looking forward to it.
[00:56:56.260 --> 00:56:59.420]   I've got a road trip coming up next week and I'm actually
[00:56:59.420 --> 00:57:00.580]   saving it.
[00:57:00.580 --> 00:57:02.780]   I'm driving up to Nashville, excuse me, I think
[00:57:02.780 --> 00:57:06.180]   Nashville, New Hampshire for a speaking at a user group there.
[00:57:06.180 --> 00:57:10.780]   And I'm saving this book for that 90-minute drive up there.
[00:57:10.780 --> 00:57:11.620]   It's gonna be great.
[00:57:11.620 --> 00:57:13.100]   - I agree with you 100%.
[00:57:13.100 --> 00:57:15.100]   It's funny, it's just a coincidence because I just happen
[00:57:15.100 --> 00:57:17.100]   to mention Neil Gaiman and how great he is.
[00:57:17.100 --> 00:57:19.020]   I had no idea he had a new book out today.
[00:57:19.020 --> 00:57:20.020]   So that's on my list.
[00:57:20.020 --> 00:57:20.860]   - There we go.
[00:57:20.860 --> 00:57:21.700]   Big time.
[00:57:21.700 --> 00:57:22.540]   - Divine ordinance.
[00:57:22.540 --> 00:57:25.380]   - Yeah, just love his stuff, really do.
[00:57:25.380 --> 00:57:27.100]   - I just want it to, same reason.
[00:57:27.100 --> 00:57:31.940]   - Really, yeah, I mean, he's just really, really good.
[00:57:31.940 --> 00:57:34.340]   Isn't it great to have that short list of authors where
[00:57:34.340 --> 00:57:36.420]   this author's name is on the bottom line?
[00:57:36.420 --> 00:57:37.780]   I don't even have to think about it.
[00:57:37.780 --> 00:57:39.060]   I know it'll be worth buying.
[00:57:39.060 --> 00:57:41.180]   And he's definitely on that list for me.
[00:57:41.180 --> 00:57:42.020]   - It's amazing.
[00:57:42.020 --> 00:57:44.060]   You can go from Sandman to Never Wear to this and it's just
[00:57:44.060 --> 00:57:46.060]   consistently great no matter what medium.
[00:57:46.060 --> 00:57:47.180]   - Right.
[00:57:47.180 --> 00:57:49.620]   Right, really truly a brilliant guy.
[00:57:49.620 --> 00:57:53.500]   I got the worst cinebench results I've ever seen.
[00:57:53.500 --> 00:57:56.260]   So I'm gonna restart it and quitting everything
[00:57:56.260 --> 00:57:58.220]   and power it up here just to see it.
[00:57:58.220 --> 00:57:59.620]   - I know it's called cinebench.
[00:57:59.620 --> 00:58:00.580]   Could he call it something else?
[00:58:00.580 --> 00:58:02.740]   'Cause I keep getting hungry for a cinnamon frosting.
[00:58:02.740 --> 00:58:06.020]   - I keep thinking it's a movie program.
[00:58:06.020 --> 00:58:07.780]   It's like a movie program to me.
[00:58:07.780 --> 00:58:09.460]   - I'll run it again and while we're running it,
[00:58:09.460 --> 00:58:13.380]   let me tell you to go to audible.com/macbreak.
[00:58:13.380 --> 00:58:16.060]   That Neil Gaiman book could be yours free.
[00:58:16.060 --> 00:58:17.540]   When you sign up for the gold account,
[00:58:17.540 --> 00:58:19.460]   you'll also get the Daily Wall Street Journal
[00:58:19.460 --> 00:58:23.260]   or New York Times digest as part of your subscription.
[00:58:23.260 --> 00:58:24.740]   I'm putting that Neil Gaiman on there right now.
[00:58:24.740 --> 00:58:26.380]   You can listen on your iPhone.
[00:58:26.380 --> 00:58:28.180]   They've got a great app for the iPhone.
[00:58:28.180 --> 00:58:30.700]   Highly recommended iPad as well.
[00:58:30.700 --> 00:58:32.460]   On every other device, Android 2,
[00:58:32.460 --> 00:58:35.100]   Windows Phone, even, Blackberry, even.
[00:58:35.100 --> 00:58:38.580]   Audible.com/macbreak.
[00:58:38.580 --> 00:58:40.140]   Give it a try today.
[00:58:40.140 --> 00:58:41.980]   We're big fans of Audible.
[00:58:41.980 --> 00:58:43.900]   We thank them for their support.
[00:58:43.900 --> 00:58:48.900]   Yeah, I got much slower than any other I7 computer out there.
[00:58:48.900 --> 00:58:52.420]   I was getting like a 2.3 or something on the cinebench.
[00:58:52.420 --> 00:58:53.900]   It looks pretty slow still.
[00:58:53.900 --> 00:58:59.860]   Two cores, four threads, 1.7 gigahertz.
[00:58:59.860 --> 00:59:03.500]   It might really be that the CPU is a little bit slow.
[00:59:03.500 --> 00:59:06.540]   - It'll burst up to I think 3.3, but it's sustained.
[00:59:06.540 --> 00:59:09.180]   - Right, well I've turned off as much as I can.
[00:59:09.180 --> 00:59:10.980]   There's still some stuff running in the background,
[00:59:10.980 --> 00:59:12.740]   but no apps running.
[00:59:12.740 --> 00:59:13.860]   I've got it plugged in.
[00:59:13.860 --> 00:59:16.700]   I presume that's using SpeedStep that Intel technology,
[00:59:16.700 --> 00:59:20.540]   which maybe when it's not plugged in,
[00:59:20.540 --> 00:59:22.900]   it doesn't quite do the same job.
[00:59:22.900 --> 00:59:23.900]   - We're gonna test a bunch of the,
[00:59:23.900 --> 00:59:25.220]   we'll test like Final Cut renders
[00:59:25.220 --> 00:59:26.140]   and a bunch of stuff like that.
[00:59:26.140 --> 00:59:26.980]   - Yeah.
[00:59:26.980 --> 00:59:30.460]   - It's a real, quicky back envelope test
[00:59:30.460 --> 00:59:32.260]   just to give us some idea.
[00:59:32.260 --> 00:59:35.140]   Surely the disk I/O makes a big difference.
[00:59:35.140 --> 00:59:38.900]   Most of the stuff we do these days is not CPU bound.
[00:59:38.900 --> 00:59:40.940]   The CPU speed is not the limitation.
[00:59:40.940 --> 00:59:44.580]   I'm also curious about this new HD 5000 graphics.
[00:59:44.580 --> 00:59:47.020]   I'll do the OpenGL test in a second too.
[00:59:47.020 --> 00:59:48.340]   We should see some--
[00:59:48.340 --> 00:59:50.260]   - Apple's pushing OpenCL heavily too.
[00:59:50.260 --> 00:59:51.700]   - Right, right.
[00:59:51.700 --> 00:59:52.820]   - I don't just be a lot of good stuff.
[00:59:52.820 --> 00:59:53.660]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:59:53.660 --> 00:59:55.780]   I don't know of any OpenCL.
[00:59:55.780 --> 00:59:58.380]   The OpenGL drivers are so bad on Apple
[00:59:58.380 --> 01:00:00.860]   that it's really not a fair test of the hardware.
[01:00:00.860 --> 01:00:02.220]   - Yeah.
[01:00:02.220 --> 01:00:04.700]   - But I don't know if, is there an OpenCL benchmark?
[01:00:04.700 --> 01:00:06.380]   - Although, do you guys use benchmark software
[01:00:06.380 --> 01:00:10.220]   or do you just kind of do your own real world stuff?
[01:00:10.220 --> 01:00:12.460]   - We do as just because people want them.
[01:00:12.460 --> 01:00:14.380]   So we say like, here's the benchmarks.
[01:00:14.380 --> 01:00:16.540]   Now this is what the real world answer is.
[01:00:16.540 --> 01:00:19.100]   But Apple did announce for Mavericks OpenGL 4.
[01:00:19.100 --> 01:00:21.380]   I don't know if it's 4 or 4.3 or what precisely it is,
[01:00:21.380 --> 01:00:23.580]   but supporting that, I know probably make a lot
[01:00:23.580 --> 01:00:24.420]   of people very happy.
[01:00:24.420 --> 01:00:27.300]   - Yeah, well, of course this is gonna,
[01:00:27.300 --> 01:00:30.540]   this Mac Pro's gonna be OpenCL,
[01:00:30.540 --> 01:00:33.860]   but all of the Pros I know really bemoan
[01:00:33.860 --> 01:00:36.620]   the very poor performance in OpenCL drivers,
[01:00:36.620 --> 01:00:38.020]   the current OpenGL drivers.
[01:00:38.020 --> 01:00:41.380]   So Apple could only make that better.
[01:00:41.380 --> 01:00:42.580]   - So all the radars.
[01:00:42.580 --> 01:00:46.900]   - I got the same crappy result, 2.67 points.
[01:00:46.900 --> 01:00:48.380]   If you look down here at the graphs,
[01:00:48.380 --> 01:00:53.540]   you can see other i7 CPUs running at faster clock speeds,
[01:00:53.540 --> 01:00:55.020]   doing in fact a much better job.
[01:00:55.020 --> 01:00:58.380]   So some of that might be the clock speed.
[01:00:58.380 --> 01:00:59.580]   What this does is a ray trace.
[01:00:59.580 --> 01:01:02.100]   Let's do the OpenGL test.
[01:01:02.100 --> 01:01:02.900]   This one's kind of fun.
[01:01:02.900 --> 01:01:05.140]   It's a real world driving game.
[01:01:05.140 --> 01:01:07.140]   I don't know if this is the best benchmark out there,
[01:01:07.140 --> 01:01:09.220]   but it is at least a benchmark.
[01:01:09.220 --> 01:01:13.500]   And I've used it before to see how well stuff does.
[01:01:13.500 --> 01:01:16.300]   It's gonna do this little street race in a second here,
[01:01:16.300 --> 01:01:17.340]   a car chase.
[01:01:17.340 --> 01:01:20.900]   And then it tests the frame rate and so forth on that.
[01:01:20.900 --> 01:01:22.940]   This takes a little while too, so.
[01:01:22.940 --> 01:01:24.740]   - We'll continue to challenge Craig Federicki
[01:01:24.740 --> 01:01:25.660]   to a game center game,
[01:01:25.660 --> 01:01:27.660]   since his name is now publicly known as hair supply,
[01:01:27.660 --> 01:01:28.500]   which should be.
[01:01:28.500 --> 01:01:29.580]   (laughing)
[01:01:29.580 --> 01:01:30.820]   - By the way, Ray reviews,
[01:01:30.820 --> 01:01:31.980]   even the Wall Street Journal said
[01:01:31.980 --> 01:01:33.940]   he's an up and coming star.
[01:01:33.940 --> 01:01:34.940]   That's pretty good.
[01:01:35.900 --> 01:01:38.140]   - The difference from last time to this time is remarkable.
[01:01:38.140 --> 01:01:39.340]   - I should go back and look.
[01:01:39.340 --> 01:01:41.180]   Was he not, yeah, I don't remember him being
[01:01:41.180 --> 01:01:43.580]   very dynamic, particularly dynamic last time.
[01:01:43.580 --> 01:01:46.980]   Do you think he got some training?
[01:01:46.980 --> 01:01:47.820]   - Stuff's changed.
[01:01:47.820 --> 01:01:49.820]   Yeah, I remember like on his first appearance,
[01:01:49.820 --> 01:01:52.300]   like with Snow leopard, like in 2009
[01:01:52.300 --> 01:01:54.500]   and line the year after, he was just shaking
[01:01:54.500 --> 01:01:55.900]   and he was like missing the mouse
[01:01:55.900 --> 01:01:56.740]   when he was doing gestures.
[01:01:56.740 --> 01:01:57.580]   - He's nervous.
[01:01:57.580 --> 01:01:58.420]   - Yeah.
[01:01:58.420 --> 01:02:00.180]   - Yeah, he seemed so, so natural.
[01:02:00.180 --> 01:02:02.940]   The WWC keynote.
[01:02:02.940 --> 01:02:03.820]   And what we did here is like,
[01:02:03.820 --> 01:02:07.780]   they got a bunch of coaches for doing the keynotes.
[01:02:07.780 --> 01:02:09.180]   Of course they had those before,
[01:02:09.180 --> 01:02:11.340]   but they kind of like up the ante on that.
[01:02:11.340 --> 01:02:12.980]   - Well paid off.
[01:02:12.980 --> 01:02:14.500]   - Yeah, they did it for all of them.
[01:02:14.500 --> 01:02:16.860]   Johnny and I as well, but he didn't end up going on stage.
[01:02:16.860 --> 01:02:19.180]   They did the video and move that.
[01:02:19.180 --> 01:02:23.860]   But yeah, Eddy Q as well was seemed nervous
[01:02:23.860 --> 01:02:26.540]   in previous appearances, but him and Federighi,
[01:02:26.540 --> 01:02:29.020]   they did a really good job and Tim Cook
[01:02:29.020 --> 01:02:30.620]   and Phil Schiller, they're also up there,
[01:02:30.620 --> 01:02:32.300]   but they always seemed very polished.
[01:02:32.300 --> 01:02:34.340]   - Do you think they all put Johnny Ive on stage
[01:02:34.340 --> 01:02:35.420]   'cause he's got a little stage, right?
[01:02:35.420 --> 01:02:37.500]   Do you have any insight into that?
[01:02:37.500 --> 01:02:40.780]   - Well, I know when they were doing the human interface
[01:02:40.780 --> 01:02:43.540]   meetings between Johnny Ive and the teams
[01:02:43.540 --> 01:02:46.180]   who do the software design, Johnny Ive,
[01:02:46.180 --> 01:02:48.580]   he did like this big keynote presentation,
[01:02:48.580 --> 01:02:50.580]   like in there, usually when they have events on campus
[01:02:50.580 --> 01:02:51.660]   in that room.
[01:02:51.660 --> 01:02:54.180]   And he kept going on like design tangents
[01:02:54.180 --> 01:02:57.180]   and wasn't very focused on the topic.
[01:02:57.180 --> 01:02:58.420]   I mean, he was talking about design,
[01:02:58.420 --> 01:03:01.060]   but he wasn't, he wasn't primed for giving
[01:03:01.060 --> 01:03:03.340]   full keynote speech in front of 6,000 people.
[01:03:03.340 --> 01:03:04.660]   - Right.
[01:03:04.660 --> 01:03:06.260]   - And you know, he does seem kind of nervous.
[01:03:06.260 --> 01:03:10.620]   I remember he did the MacBook keynote in late 2008
[01:03:10.620 --> 01:03:12.980]   when they did that whole new aluminum
[01:03:12.980 --> 01:03:15.700]   manufacturing process, right, unibody,
[01:03:15.700 --> 01:03:18.580]   but I don't think he's done any stage appearances since then.
[01:03:18.580 --> 01:03:19.900]   But he seems to like the videos.
[01:03:19.900 --> 01:03:22.380]   You know, those are very controlled.
[01:03:22.380 --> 01:03:24.300]   You know, they can film them as many times as they want,
[01:03:24.300 --> 01:03:25.220]   edit it and perfect it.
[01:03:25.220 --> 01:03:26.700]   But you know, it's very different on stage.
[01:03:26.700 --> 01:03:28.180]   - What did he did that British kids show?
[01:03:28.180 --> 01:03:31.020]   He won the McCracken Award or whatever the hell it was.
[01:03:31.020 --> 01:03:32.020]   - He was good on that.
[01:03:32.020 --> 01:03:33.020]   - He was good on that.
[01:03:33.020 --> 01:03:34.180]   He was fun on that.
[01:03:34.180 --> 01:03:36.420]   But again, that might have been somewhat edited.
[01:03:36.420 --> 01:03:39.100]   So the OpenGL results are also crappy,
[01:03:39.100 --> 01:03:42.540]   but no crappier than anything else I've ever used on a Mac.
[01:03:42.540 --> 01:03:45.620]   21.8 frames per second.
[01:03:45.620 --> 01:03:49.300]   That's a pretty, that's pretty, pretty typical
[01:03:49.300 --> 01:03:51.460]   and not very exceptional performance.
[01:03:51.460 --> 01:03:55.060]   I think the HD 5000 graphics are capable of much more.
[01:03:55.060 --> 01:03:56.180]   Try this on Windows machine.
[01:03:56.180 --> 01:03:57.620]   You'll probably get three times the results.
[01:03:57.620 --> 01:03:59.700]   And that's a, I think that's really more measure
[01:03:59.700 --> 01:04:02.220]   of the poor, it's gonna be interesting
[01:04:02.220 --> 01:04:03.900]   to compare that to Mavericks too.
[01:04:03.900 --> 01:04:04.740]   - Yeah.
[01:04:04.740 --> 01:04:05.580]   - Yeah, good.
[01:04:05.580 --> 01:04:08.900]   Well, let's save these results and...
[01:04:08.900 --> 01:04:11.140]   - Don't say publicly, but if you can whisper in Leo's ear
[01:04:11.140 --> 01:04:12.660]   what the Maverick results are then.
[01:04:12.660 --> 01:04:15.260]   - Oh, we can have that, don't they?
[01:04:15.260 --> 01:04:17.500]   But it wouldn't, I don't think it's fair.
[01:04:17.500 --> 01:04:19.020]   That's one of the reasons I don't do,
[01:04:19.020 --> 01:04:24.820]   you know, beta softwares 'cause that's not fair.
[01:04:24.820 --> 01:04:25.660]   - Yeah.
[01:04:25.660 --> 01:04:26.660]   - And Pete, I got a lot of criticism
[01:04:26.660 --> 01:04:31.660]   and understandably about the critiques I made of iOS 7.
[01:04:31.660 --> 01:04:35.420]   But, you know, 'cause it is beta
[01:04:35.420 --> 01:04:36.740]   and of course it could very well change.
[01:04:36.740 --> 01:04:40.060]   But if we don't scream and yell now, but it won't change.
[01:04:40.060 --> 01:04:42.580]   - Well, no, 'cause that's not gonna be the screaming
[01:04:42.580 --> 01:04:44.260]   and yelling of the people who are looking at the beta.
[01:04:44.260 --> 01:04:47.180]   It's gonna be from the users like eight months from now
[01:04:47.180 --> 01:04:49.180]   after it's been out for a few months.
[01:04:49.180 --> 01:04:50.820]   I've been sort of disappointed,
[01:04:50.820 --> 01:04:52.340]   I'm sorry, disappointed as a strong word.
[01:04:52.340 --> 01:04:54.420]   I thought I was curious that there's so many people
[01:04:54.420 --> 01:04:56.180]   who have been writing very, very strong,
[01:04:56.180 --> 01:04:59.060]   inclusive opinions both positively and negatively
[01:04:59.060 --> 01:05:02.820]   about iOS 7, given that Apple has a history of their,
[01:05:02.820 --> 01:05:04.660]   they will release something at WWDC.
[01:05:04.660 --> 01:05:08.700]   It will look not quite like the same thing
[01:05:08.700 --> 01:05:11.740]   that they shipped in September or October.
[01:05:11.740 --> 01:05:13.340]   It's gonna go through all kinds of different changes
[01:05:13.340 --> 01:05:14.540]   on top of all that.
[01:05:14.540 --> 01:05:18.100]   It's iOS 7 is such a departure from iOS 6
[01:05:18.100 --> 01:05:20.340]   that a lot of it's just gonna have to be,
[01:05:20.340 --> 01:05:24.140]   how much are you pleased or revolted by the fact
[01:05:24.140 --> 01:05:26.140]   that it's so different from what you've been using
[01:05:26.140 --> 01:05:27.500]   since 2007?
[01:05:27.500 --> 01:05:30.500]   And so much of it's gonna rely on third party software
[01:05:30.500 --> 01:05:33.580]   that finds a way to interpret and rearticulate
[01:05:33.580 --> 01:05:35.540]   all these new user interface mandates.
[01:05:35.540 --> 01:05:38.540]   So I don't think that anybody can say anything conclusive,
[01:05:38.540 --> 01:05:41.060]   positively or negatively until September, October
[01:05:41.060 --> 01:05:42.780]   at the earliest.
[01:05:42.780 --> 01:05:44.780]   - Yeah, but it's still ugly, but ugly.
[01:05:44.780 --> 01:05:45.940]   (laughing)
[01:05:45.940 --> 01:05:46.860]   - You're doing stuff?
[01:05:46.860 --> 01:05:48.180]   - I agree with it.
[01:05:48.180 --> 01:05:50.900]   - Is there a benchmark you can run to test about ugliness?
[01:05:50.900 --> 01:05:51.860]   - It's about ugly.
[01:05:51.860 --> 01:05:54.540]   You know, it's purely purely subjective.
[01:05:54.540 --> 01:05:55.980]   You like it a lot, Mark?
[01:05:55.980 --> 01:05:56.820]   You think it's beautiful?
[01:05:56.820 --> 01:05:58.540]   - Yeah, I really, really like it.
[01:05:58.540 --> 01:06:00.300]   - You're a little younger than me.
[01:06:00.300 --> 01:06:01.140]   - What?
[01:06:01.140 --> 01:06:03.700]   - How do you feel about sugar coated cereals in general?
[01:06:03.700 --> 01:06:05.780]   - Sugar coated cereals?
[01:06:05.780 --> 01:06:07.580]   I don't really, I don't eat sugar coated cereals.
[01:06:07.580 --> 01:06:09.060]   - Oh good, all right, well that's a good sign.
[01:06:09.060 --> 01:06:24.300]   You're not a F
[01:06:24.300 --> 01:06:25.980]   - Sure, Mark. - A folder.
[01:06:25.980 --> 01:06:27.460]   - Yeah, more mature.
[01:06:27.460 --> 01:06:29.060]   - Those two years are important.
[01:06:29.060 --> 01:06:29.900]   (laughing)
[01:06:29.900 --> 01:06:32.380]   - Like family on Father's Day celebrations, whatnot.
[01:06:32.380 --> 01:06:34.340]   And you know, everyone is really blown away with it.
[01:06:34.340 --> 01:06:36.780]   Like, you know, but way the icons fly in.
[01:06:36.780 --> 01:06:38.740]   They really like the multitasking.
[01:06:38.740 --> 01:06:40.180]   And you know, - Interesting.
[01:06:40.180 --> 01:06:42.700]   - Popular opinion, everyone seems to really like the icons.
[01:06:42.700 --> 01:06:43.620]   So.
[01:06:43.620 --> 01:06:45.260]   - Well just me.
[01:06:45.260 --> 01:06:48.180]   - And you know, here's the thing to Andy's point about,
[01:06:48.180 --> 01:06:51.300]   you know, like not writing articles
[01:06:51.300 --> 01:06:52.660]   being inclusive about iOS 7.
[01:06:52.660 --> 01:06:54.820]   And if you remember like last year, you know,
[01:06:54.820 --> 01:06:57.180]   when the first beta came out and the beta's with maps came out,
[01:06:57.180 --> 01:06:58.580]   you know, it was pretty crappy.
[01:06:58.580 --> 01:06:59.900]   And you know, lots of people saying,
[01:06:59.900 --> 01:07:01.580]   hey, just relax, it's gonna get better.
[01:07:01.580 --> 01:07:03.540]   And then it didn't happen after it goes public,
[01:07:03.540 --> 01:07:05.820]   you know, whole backlash and Scott Forest also fired.
[01:07:05.820 --> 01:07:06.660]   So.
[01:07:06.660 --> 01:07:07.500]   - Mm hmm.
[01:07:07.500 --> 01:07:10.620]   But it's, well it's, it's, it just feels a little bit like
[01:07:10.620 --> 01:07:14.100]   reviewing a movie based on a, based on an early cut.
[01:07:14.100 --> 01:07:14.940]   - That's true.
[01:07:14.940 --> 01:07:16.100]   - Yeah, but they released it.
[01:07:16.100 --> 01:07:17.700]   - They released it though, Andy.
[01:07:17.700 --> 01:07:18.540]   - No, they didn't.
[01:07:18.540 --> 01:07:19.380]   No, they didn't.
[01:07:19.380 --> 01:07:22.220]   You can't, you can't get this unless you pay $100.
[01:07:22.220 --> 01:07:24.300]   - And also agree that you're not gonna talk to anybody
[01:07:24.300 --> 01:07:25.380]   about what you've seen in this.
[01:07:25.380 --> 01:07:26.740]   That's not a public release.
[01:07:26.740 --> 01:07:29.900]   - Oh no, I wasn't talking about the running software.
[01:07:29.900 --> 01:07:32.940]   I was talking about what they showed at the keynote.
[01:07:32.940 --> 01:07:34.460]   - Yeah, but, but that's, yeah.
[01:07:34.460 --> 01:07:37.180]   I mean, and that's, and that stuff is very, very pretty.
[01:07:37.180 --> 01:07:39.340]   - And I, well, that's a matter of taste.
[01:07:39.340 --> 01:07:41.020]   - I mean, I've, well again, it's, well again,
[01:07:41.020 --> 01:07:41.860]   it's a matter of personal taste.
[01:07:41.860 --> 01:07:43.980]   - Not the word that leapt to mind.
[01:07:43.980 --> 01:07:45.420]   - I'm not, I'm not talking about, you know,
[01:07:45.420 --> 01:07:47.220]   people shouldn't even say I personally like it,
[01:07:47.220 --> 01:07:48.460]   or I personally don't like it.
[01:07:48.460 --> 01:07:50.780]   But I, occasionally you see, you hear people saying,
[01:07:50.780 --> 01:07:52.140]   "Oh, well this is gonna be a disaster,
[01:07:52.140 --> 01:07:53.620]   and oh, what a horrible step backward."
[01:07:53.620 --> 01:07:54.820]   And I hate this, and this is terrible,
[01:07:54.820 --> 01:07:56.260]   and it's an awful step backward.
[01:07:56.260 --> 01:07:58.020]   Maybe your first impressions are spot on,
[01:07:58.020 --> 01:08:00.020]   and maybe they're completely wrong.
[01:08:00.020 --> 01:08:01.900]   But I just think that they should be presented
[01:08:01.900 --> 01:08:03.460]   in the proper context, that this is something
[01:08:03.460 --> 01:08:06.100]   that is still several months away from being released.
[01:08:06.100 --> 01:08:09.300]   And also it's missing the context of the world
[01:08:09.300 --> 01:08:11.580]   that it's gonna be released into.
[01:08:11.580 --> 01:08:14.820]   So it's, 'cause I did, I did spend about an hour with it,
[01:08:14.820 --> 01:08:16.540]   and that's about as much as I,
[01:08:16.540 --> 01:08:19.820]   as I'm willing to spend before I go under NDA on it.
[01:08:19.820 --> 01:08:21.180]   And there are a lot of things I really liked,
[01:08:21.180 --> 01:08:24.100]   the multitasking is just, that's, thank you.
[01:08:24.100 --> 01:08:28.220]   Whoever, if there was a good reason for Palm
[01:08:28.220 --> 01:08:30.540]   to go out of business, it's because Apple could then hire
[01:08:30.540 --> 01:08:33.820]   on some people and get some great ideas for the OS.
[01:08:33.820 --> 01:08:35.900]   There are a lot of great ideas that I've been hoping
[01:08:35.900 --> 01:08:39.820]   to see in iOS for years that are showing up.
[01:08:39.820 --> 01:08:40.940]   And there's some things that I thought,
[01:08:40.940 --> 01:08:43.340]   "Oh, is that really gonna be the way that worked?"
[01:08:43.340 --> 01:08:47.060]   And also the ultimate and the snarky,
[01:08:47.060 --> 01:08:50.860]   and uncalled for comment that a user can have.
[01:08:50.860 --> 01:08:53.460]   And also the comment that you think of at least three times
[01:08:53.460 --> 01:08:55.220]   per hour when using something brand new is,
[01:08:55.220 --> 01:08:56.900]   saying, "You know what you should try doing?
[01:08:56.900 --> 01:08:59.060]   "I think the developers should try, I don't know,
[01:08:59.060 --> 01:09:00.660]   "using their software."
[01:09:00.660 --> 01:09:01.500]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:09:01.500 --> 01:09:03.660]   - That's like, of course not like that.
[01:09:03.660 --> 01:09:05.420]   But there are a couple moments like that where it's like,
[01:09:05.420 --> 01:09:09.020]   "Oh, so that's how we're unlocking the screen now."
[01:09:09.020 --> 01:09:10.020]   - Yeah, interesting.
[01:09:10.020 --> 01:09:12.540]   - The biggest difference for me with iOS 7
[01:09:12.540 --> 01:09:14.820]   as opposed to different years is that other years,
[01:09:14.820 --> 01:09:16.900]   the stuff on there was basically finished.
[01:09:16.900 --> 01:09:19.020]   Like they might change the way a background looked,
[01:09:19.020 --> 01:09:21.380]   they might change it to linen instead of the,
[01:09:21.380 --> 01:09:24.500]   whatever it was before, the big square backgrounds.
[01:09:24.500 --> 01:09:26.940]   But this one, you open it up and you can see that
[01:09:26.940 --> 01:09:28.300]   on apple.com or on the keynote,
[01:09:28.300 --> 01:09:30.900]   there's just built-in apps they haven't shown off yet.
[01:09:30.900 --> 01:09:33.300]   And the ones they did show off were a subset of those
[01:09:33.300 --> 01:09:35.580]   that looked much better and much more polished.
[01:09:35.580 --> 01:09:38.220]   And that simple fact alone tells me that,
[01:09:38.220 --> 01:09:39.700]   you know, this was a much earlier beta
[01:09:39.700 --> 01:09:41.140]   than they've ever released before.
[01:09:41.140 --> 01:09:43.500]   The iPad version was, you know, stopped,
[01:09:43.500 --> 01:09:45.380]   they didn't even release a beta for that.
[01:09:45.380 --> 01:09:47.380]   This is far earlier along the process
[01:09:47.380 --> 01:09:48.380]   than we've ever had before.
[01:09:48.380 --> 01:09:50.380]   And that leads me to believe that while they are
[01:09:50.380 --> 01:09:52.020]   in there finishing those other apps,
[01:09:52.020 --> 01:09:54.420]   they'll be in there doing a lot of stuff.
[01:09:54.420 --> 01:09:56.660]   And I think that what we see in September
[01:09:56.660 --> 01:09:59.220]   might be different than what we see now.
[01:09:59.220 --> 01:10:00.780]   And if you still have those issues,
[01:10:00.780 --> 01:10:02.460]   it's absolutely fair to go after them.
[01:10:02.460 --> 01:10:04.220]   And I do like to Leo's point that people
[01:10:04.220 --> 01:10:06.060]   are complaining now because if they think,
[01:10:06.060 --> 01:10:08.100]   for example, our grid is great and we're like,
[01:10:08.100 --> 01:10:10.620]   no, you have to stop the acceleration way before
[01:10:10.620 --> 01:10:12.500]   you get to the edge of the icon.
[01:10:12.500 --> 01:10:14.660]   And they hear that and they're more open to that kind
[01:10:14.660 --> 01:10:16.340]   of stuff because there's not one guy deciding
[01:10:16.340 --> 01:10:18.220]   what color blue is the icon anymore.
[01:10:18.220 --> 01:10:20.820]   I think it behooves really good designers
[01:10:20.820 --> 01:10:23.380]   and good developers to express a lot of opinions.
[01:10:23.380 --> 01:10:25.660]   - Yeah, look what Microsoft did with Windows 8.
[01:10:25.660 --> 01:10:26.700]   They did not listen.
[01:10:26.700 --> 01:10:30.620]   And then they now have to, as my friend Paul Thorett
[01:10:30.620 --> 01:10:34.060]   says, take a mulligan and change it.
[01:10:34.060 --> 01:10:37.300]   And so I, you know, presumably part of the beta process
[01:10:37.300 --> 01:10:38.820]   is seeing how people react.
[01:10:38.820 --> 01:10:41.380]   I'm curious though, Mark, because you're, you know,
[01:10:41.380 --> 01:10:44.580]   your family, are they all iPhone current iPhone users
[01:10:44.580 --> 01:10:46.900]   or are they in the position where they might be saying,
[01:10:46.900 --> 01:10:49.540]   gee, should my next phone be the next generation iPhone
[01:10:49.540 --> 01:10:51.540]   or the next generation Android phone?
[01:10:51.540 --> 01:10:53.660]   - Now everyone I showed it to was a, you know,
[01:10:53.660 --> 01:10:56.260]   iPhone user since, you know, maybe first,
[01:10:56.260 --> 01:10:57.500]   second or third generation.
[01:10:57.500 --> 01:10:59.500]   So, you know, they've become really, really used
[01:10:59.500 --> 01:11:00.340]   to the platform.
[01:11:00.340 --> 01:11:03.020]   - And they're not considering changing away from it.
[01:11:03.020 --> 01:11:05.740]   - Oh, no, like they're just so addicted to the apps
[01:11:05.740 --> 01:11:07.060]   and just so easy to use.
[01:11:07.060 --> 01:11:09.540]   I mean, like when I put, I put it like iOS 7
[01:11:09.540 --> 01:11:12.260]   this way back in April, like it's fresh but familiar.
[01:11:12.260 --> 01:11:14.020]   It really works the same way.
[01:11:14.020 --> 01:11:16.380]   It's just like a real new coat of paint.
[01:11:16.380 --> 01:11:21.020]   There's not any changes in terms of functionality.
[01:11:21.020 --> 01:11:22.460]   - Well, and that's my point.
[01:11:22.460 --> 01:11:25.460]   That's what I think interesting is that Apple isn't trying
[01:11:25.460 --> 01:11:28.300]   to keep up with Android particular, a little bit,
[01:11:28.300 --> 01:11:30.300]   a little bit, but not to the point
[01:11:30.300 --> 01:11:32.700]   where it would make your family unhappy.
[01:11:32.700 --> 01:11:34.220]   - Right, they're doing the right stuff.
[01:11:34.220 --> 01:11:36.700]   Like they're doing, they're throwing in some things
[01:11:36.700 --> 01:11:38.220]   that you're like, ooh, like an ooh all moment,
[01:11:38.220 --> 01:11:40.620]   like the parallax and maybe like the multitasking,
[01:11:40.620 --> 01:11:43.860]   but also some more functional stuff like airdrop.
[01:11:43.860 --> 01:11:47.260]   And the new Photos app is actually one of my favorite features
[01:11:47.260 --> 01:11:49.460]   from what I've seen on apple.com and the nakino.
[01:11:49.460 --> 01:11:51.780]   It's just the way it organizes everything.
[01:11:51.780 --> 01:11:53.660]   It's, you know, it's great.
[01:11:53.660 --> 01:11:57.220]   And I think lots of people are really gonna like iOS 7.
[01:11:57.220 --> 01:12:00.380]   And, you know, just like Renee was saying,
[01:12:00.380 --> 01:12:01.860]   I don't doubt that stuff will change,
[01:12:01.860 --> 01:12:04.300]   but I think the general picture is there.
[01:12:04.300 --> 01:12:05.580]   - Right.
[01:12:05.580 --> 01:12:07.420]   You might just need a second coat of paint at some place.
[01:12:07.420 --> 01:12:08.260]   - It's just so hideous to me.
[01:12:08.260 --> 01:12:09.100]   - Yeah.
[01:12:09.100 --> 01:12:11.340]   - But see, I'm not the market, so, you know,
[01:12:11.340 --> 01:12:13.180]   I've already made that switch.
[01:12:13.180 --> 01:12:14.740]   - Also using it, I mean, when you see it, Leo,
[01:12:14.740 --> 01:12:16.460]   it's different, 'cause I had reservations
[01:12:16.460 --> 01:12:17.900]   when I first thought it was so different
[01:12:17.900 --> 01:12:20.180]   and I didn't know how much of that was change aversion,
[01:12:20.180 --> 01:12:22.420]   but I tried it, some of my friends have tried it now.
[01:12:22.420 --> 01:12:24.900]   And when you use it, that was to me the biggest change
[01:12:24.900 --> 01:12:26.140]   is this gamification.
[01:12:26.140 --> 01:12:28.180]   I mean, they hired, this was on Twitter,
[01:12:28.180 --> 01:12:29.780]   I don't know if there's ever disclosing that,
[01:12:29.780 --> 01:12:31.980]   but I never heard about it under NDA.
[01:12:31.980 --> 01:12:34.260]   They hired the guy who did Quake II Tournament
[01:12:34.260 --> 01:12:36.460]   to build this 3D graphics engine
[01:12:36.460 --> 01:12:37.940]   and all those particle effects.
[01:12:37.940 --> 01:12:39.780]   And this entire system is gamified.
[01:12:39.780 --> 01:12:42.300]   And it's, when you're in there using some of these apps,
[01:12:42.300 --> 01:12:44.820]   it's like playing a game, it's not only delightful,
[01:12:44.820 --> 01:12:47.020]   but it's engaging, it makes you wanna use it more.
[01:12:47.020 --> 01:12:48.580]   And that's a profound change.
[01:12:48.580 --> 01:12:50.220]   That's like that, I was begging for this.
[01:12:50.220 --> 01:12:51.860]   I don't want them to just catch up with Android.
[01:12:51.860 --> 01:12:55.300]   Every iOS 7 want list I saw was a list of Android
[01:12:55.300 --> 01:12:57.100]   or other software. - Right.
[01:12:57.100 --> 01:12:58.900]   - And I didn't want that, I'd buy an Android if I wanted this.
[01:12:58.900 --> 01:13:02.180]   I wanted the next thing, and this isn't all the way there,
[01:13:02.180 --> 01:13:05.300]   but the idea of gamified 3D interface, I think,
[01:13:05.300 --> 01:13:07.820]   I can't wait to see what developers do with this
[01:13:07.820 --> 01:13:09.300]   over the next six, 12 months.
[01:13:09.300 --> 01:13:11.260]   - Well, in this place to a strength they have,
[01:13:11.260 --> 01:13:12.780]   because they do their own chip design,
[01:13:12.780 --> 01:13:15.060]   they have some very sophisticated hardware,
[01:13:15.060 --> 01:13:17.220]   and it's tightly coupled to the OS,
[01:13:17.220 --> 01:13:20.180]   so they can do things like these particle effects
[01:13:20.180 --> 01:13:23.860]   and build it into the hardware in ways that others can't.
[01:13:23.860 --> 01:13:27.020]   - And it's a champ, as much as we make fun of the Mac on GL,
[01:13:27.020 --> 01:13:29.260]   the iPhone was built with an interface based on OpenGL
[01:13:29.260 --> 01:13:31.380]   and that gave us iOS gaming.
[01:13:31.380 --> 01:13:33.940]   And now this stuff, it's hard to imagine that all this stuff
[01:13:33.940 --> 01:13:35.340]   won't trickle down to developers too,
[01:13:35.340 --> 01:13:37.500]   and just give them a lot of this stuff for free.
[01:13:37.500 --> 01:13:40.420]   - Yeah, I mean, when the subtler things about iOS 7,
[01:13:40.420 --> 01:13:42.580]   again, giving my limited experience with it,
[01:13:42.580 --> 01:13:44.500]   is just you notice immediately, my God,
[01:13:44.500 --> 01:13:47.340]   the frame rate in here is just jacked up
[01:13:47.340 --> 01:13:49.660]   to an insane level, the motion.
[01:13:49.660 --> 01:13:53.100]   I mean, on Android and all kinds of other,
[01:13:53.100 --> 01:13:55.460]   all kinds of other multi-touch devices,
[01:13:55.460 --> 01:13:57.580]   the scrolling is perfectly fine, it's even fluid,
[01:13:57.580 --> 01:14:01.420]   it's even liquid, but that's just the iOS 7 on an iPhone 5,
[01:14:01.420 --> 01:14:03.100]   it just takes it to a whole new level.
[01:14:03.100 --> 01:14:06.220]   It really just, it's like a photo on air skates.
[01:14:06.220 --> 01:14:08.380]   But the question is gonna be, how much is this?
[01:14:08.380 --> 01:14:11.340]   I mean, the question is gonna be,
[01:14:11.340 --> 01:14:14.300]   how much of these effects are gonna translate
[01:14:14.300 --> 01:14:17.340]   into making a better phone versus making a cooler phone
[01:14:17.340 --> 01:14:19.100]   or making a more beautiful phone?
[01:14:19.100 --> 01:14:22.900]   And something more beautiful is actually a practical feature
[01:14:22.900 --> 01:14:25.820]   because it makes the device more pleasant to use
[01:14:25.820 --> 01:14:28.860]   and the environment a more pleasant place to be.
[01:14:28.860 --> 01:14:31.940]   I would hope to see in iOS 8,
[01:14:32.780 --> 01:14:35.260]   some changes in philosophy.
[01:14:35.260 --> 01:14:37.500]   And we're seeing some of that stuff in iOS 7,
[01:14:37.500 --> 01:14:39.460]   we're seeing Apple's trying to find ways
[01:14:39.460 --> 01:14:42.100]   to allow developers to have more access
[01:14:42.100 --> 01:14:46.340]   into processes and more ways of talking to hardware
[01:14:46.340 --> 01:14:48.580]   and more ways of talking to other pieces of software.
[01:14:48.580 --> 01:14:51.180]   That's the sort of stuff that I'll be more interested in
[01:14:51.180 --> 01:14:53.340]   when it actually happens.
[01:14:53.340 --> 01:14:54.820]   - Well, I'll defer judgment, of course,
[01:14:54.820 --> 01:14:56.500]   and you know, I'll buy one, but,
[01:14:56.500 --> 01:14:59.140]   God, I just think it looks hideous.
[01:14:59.140 --> 01:15:00.060]   - Just look at those demos, they help,
[01:15:00.060 --> 01:15:01.460]   I mean, they're running OpenGL standards.
[01:15:01.460 --> 01:15:03.420]   I mean, they've got blur on almost all the time
[01:15:03.420 --> 01:15:05.300]   and they're still hitting that frame rate.
[01:15:05.300 --> 01:15:07.540]   - You know, that's impressive, it's very snappy.
[01:15:07.540 --> 01:15:08.660]   There's no question about that.
[01:15:08.660 --> 01:15:10.380]   And that's on an iPhone 5.
[01:15:10.380 --> 01:15:12.820]   - Absolutely, and I mean, as much as some people say
[01:15:12.820 --> 01:15:14.820]   it looks like Windows Phone or it looks like Android,
[01:15:14.820 --> 01:15:16.820]   I mean, it ended up looking in some way similar,
[01:15:16.820 --> 01:15:19.180]   but the philosophy, I mean, this is not--
[01:15:19.180 --> 01:15:21.740]   - Look how fast that cover flow, yeah, that's amazing.
[01:15:21.740 --> 01:15:24.540]   - I mean, this is like that with everything turned on again,
[01:15:24.540 --> 01:15:25.740]   which is crazy.
[01:15:25.740 --> 01:15:28.060]   - And I think that the other thing we don't know,
[01:15:28.060 --> 01:15:31.420]   but I bet you, there'll be a very good battery life
[01:15:31.420 --> 01:15:32.260]   on this thing.
[01:15:32.260 --> 01:15:33.500]   I think they're paying a lot of attention to that.
[01:15:33.500 --> 01:15:35.780]   They should, because that is becoming
[01:15:35.780 --> 01:15:38.580]   a big differentiator in phones.
[01:15:38.580 --> 01:15:42.300]   If you had two day battery life on something like this,
[01:15:42.300 --> 01:15:45.460]   which I think is doable, with the bright OS support
[01:15:45.460 --> 01:15:49.300]   for coalescing events and things like that,
[01:15:49.300 --> 01:15:52.100]   that would get people's attention.
[01:15:52.100 --> 01:15:53.420]   - What I liked about Apple this year
[01:15:53.420 --> 01:15:54.860]   is that they were so careful,
[01:15:54.860 --> 01:15:56.820]   'cause some years they've really turned off developers
[01:15:56.820 --> 01:15:58.860]   by the way that they just phrased things.
[01:15:58.860 --> 01:16:00.140]   And this year, they could have said,
[01:16:00.140 --> 01:16:01.380]   we're taking over multitasking,
[01:16:01.380 --> 01:16:03.660]   we're taking over processes, you'll do it, we tell you,
[01:16:03.660 --> 01:16:05.500]   but they didn't, they kind of told them,
[01:16:05.500 --> 01:16:07.380]   look, this is the kind of smarts we're putting in there.
[01:16:07.380 --> 01:16:09.060]   So we'll just, the GPS turns on,
[01:16:09.060 --> 01:16:11.980]   we'll just automatically put your GPS events in there.
[01:16:11.980 --> 01:16:13.500]   We're doing, you have a good radio signal,
[01:16:13.500 --> 01:16:14.460]   okay, we'll do this now,
[01:16:14.460 --> 01:16:15.820]   we won't do it when you're on a weak radio signal
[01:16:15.820 --> 01:16:16.900]   and we drain your battery.
[01:16:16.900 --> 01:16:19.300]   And that seems like you're adding value to the performance
[01:16:19.300 --> 01:16:21.060]   and the usability of their product,
[01:16:21.060 --> 01:16:22.300]   and that makes them really happy,
[01:16:22.300 --> 01:16:25.060]   so they're more likely to use your stuff.
[01:16:25.060 --> 01:16:28.380]   Well, we'll see, we'll see.
[01:16:28.380 --> 01:16:30.060]   I think it's a challenging world
[01:16:30.060 --> 01:16:32.700]   and it gets increasingly challenging for Apple,
[01:16:32.700 --> 01:16:35.220]   that there are gonna be people like Mark's family
[01:16:35.220 --> 01:16:39.180]   who are committed to the platform.
[01:16:39.180 --> 01:16:40.780]   I'm very curious what their reaction
[01:16:40.780 --> 01:16:42.380]   will be in the long run.
[01:16:42.380 --> 01:16:43.220]   'Cause I mean,
[01:16:43.220 --> 01:16:45.700]   colors and icons are really a matter of taste,
[01:16:45.700 --> 01:16:48.440]   not, that's not about the spec at all.
[01:16:48.440 --> 01:16:53.220]   And people go along with it, they get used to it.
[01:16:53.220 --> 01:16:55.340]   But like, it's a facial place.
[01:16:55.340 --> 01:16:58.580]   I feel like the analogy that I keep coming back to is,
[01:16:58.580 --> 01:17:01.500]   it's sort of like a company has invented
[01:17:01.500 --> 01:17:03.220]   the first digital synthesizer
[01:17:03.220 --> 01:17:04.820]   and they're selling it to musicians.
[01:17:04.820 --> 01:17:07.780]   And the demo makes you think one thing about it.
[01:17:07.780 --> 01:17:09.260]   And it's gonna be a positive reaction,
[01:17:09.260 --> 01:17:10.100]   maybe it's a negative one,
[01:17:10.100 --> 01:17:13.220]   but it's not until 100,000 musicians get their hands on it
[01:17:13.220 --> 01:17:14.900]   and use those tools to build the things
[01:17:14.900 --> 01:17:15.860]   that they wanna build
[01:17:15.860 --> 01:17:18.420]   that we're gonna see exactly how good this mechanism is.
[01:17:18.420 --> 01:17:19.540]   It could be that's 10 times better
[01:17:19.540 --> 01:17:20.900]   than even Apple is saying it is.
[01:17:20.900 --> 01:17:21.740]   Right.
[01:17:22.860 --> 01:17:23.700]   Let's take a break.
[01:17:23.700 --> 01:17:26.340]   We are talking to Andy Inako, Mark Gurman from nine to five,
[01:17:26.340 --> 01:17:28.020]   Mack, his first time here.
[01:17:28.020 --> 01:17:28.900]   Nice to have you, Mark.
[01:17:28.900 --> 01:17:30.380]   Really appreciate it.
[01:17:30.380 --> 01:17:34.340]   And Renee Ritchie about all things Mackintosh
[01:17:34.340 --> 01:17:38.660]   or show today brought to you by my glasses provider.
[01:17:38.660 --> 01:17:41.100]   This is an interesting advertisement.
[01:17:41.100 --> 01:17:43.540]   Have you heard about Warby Parker?
[01:17:43.540 --> 01:17:45.060]   One of the things that people got,
[01:17:45.060 --> 01:17:46.900]   Warby got attention and I don't know if it's true or not,
[01:17:46.900 --> 01:17:49.900]   it was the rumor that they were gonna be called in by Google
[01:17:49.900 --> 01:17:53.380]   to stylish up the Google glass.
[01:17:53.380 --> 01:17:57.260]   What Warby is is a startup about ordering eyeglasses.
[01:17:57.260 --> 01:17:58.980]   You'd think that that, well,
[01:17:58.980 --> 01:18:00.780]   that's, there's nothing new in the world.
[01:18:00.780 --> 01:18:03.140]   Well, I gotta tell you that the eyeglass business
[01:18:03.140 --> 01:18:05.700]   is kind of monopolized by one company
[01:18:05.700 --> 01:18:08.900]   and they have really inflated the prices of eyeglasses.
[01:18:08.900 --> 01:18:10.500]   If you wear prescription glasses,
[01:18:10.500 --> 01:18:12.060]   what did you pay last time?
[01:18:12.060 --> 01:18:16.580]   400, 500, 600 dollars for a pair of glasses.
[01:18:16.580 --> 01:18:17.740]   It can be done better.
[01:18:17.740 --> 01:18:20.220]   And Warby Parker is determined to do so.
[01:18:20.220 --> 01:18:23.780]   They have glasses starting at just $95 with lens.
[01:18:23.780 --> 01:18:26.140]   Their titanium collection, which is gorgeous,
[01:18:26.140 --> 01:18:29.460]   starts at $145 including prescription lenses
[01:18:29.460 --> 01:18:31.420]   with premium Japanese titanium
[01:18:31.420 --> 01:18:34.140]   and French non-rocking screws.
[01:18:34.140 --> 01:18:36.540]   All glasses always include anti-reflective
[01:18:36.540 --> 01:18:39.420]   and anti-glare coating, a hard case,
[01:18:39.420 --> 01:18:40.860]   and cleaning cloth.
[01:18:40.860 --> 01:18:42.540]   The case is beautiful by the way.
[01:18:42.540 --> 01:18:46.220]   But you might say, but Leo, you might say,
[01:18:46.220 --> 01:18:47.900]   I can't order my glasses.
[01:18:47.900 --> 01:18:50.100]   Wait a minute, they have span of steel glasses?
[01:18:50.100 --> 01:18:51.340]   Clark Kent glasses?
[01:18:51.340 --> 01:18:52.180]   (laughs)
[01:18:52.180 --> 01:18:53.140]   I love it.
[01:18:53.140 --> 01:18:56.540]   You might say, I can't order my glasses on the web,
[01:18:56.540 --> 01:18:58.100]   on the internet, I need to try them on.
[01:18:58.100 --> 01:19:00.580]   Well, Warby Parker has thought about that.
[01:19:00.580 --> 01:19:05.100]   They are using the same beautiful glasses sold in boutiques
[01:19:05.100 --> 01:19:07.700]   available at very low prices,
[01:19:07.700 --> 01:19:09.780]   classic vintage styling,
[01:19:09.780 --> 01:19:12.180]   no more bland overpriced eyewear,
[01:19:12.180 --> 01:19:14.740]   and you can try it before you buy.
[01:19:14.740 --> 01:19:15.580]   So here's what happens.
[01:19:15.580 --> 01:19:17.020]   If you go to Warby Parker,
[01:19:17.020 --> 01:19:20.100]   you can do the free home try-on pro.
[01:19:20.100 --> 01:19:21.380]   Actually Chad, why don't you go in there?
[01:19:21.380 --> 01:19:22.380]   'Cause it's great, 'cause what you do
[01:19:22.380 --> 01:19:24.700]   is you browse through the frames at Warby,
[01:19:24.700 --> 01:19:26.860]   and you add them to your try-on.
[01:19:26.860 --> 01:19:31.140]   You can get as many as, I think, five frames
[01:19:31.140 --> 01:19:33.060]   sent to your house.
[01:19:33.060 --> 01:19:35.820]   You'll get this special frame box.
[01:19:35.820 --> 01:19:37.060]   Here's the box.
[01:19:37.060 --> 01:19:38.420]   And these are my try-ons.
[01:19:38.420 --> 01:19:40.300]   So these are frames that I'd said,
[01:19:40.300 --> 01:19:42.380]   oh, I'd like to look at the Rutherford
[01:19:42.380 --> 01:19:44.780]   brushed granite tinted demo,
[01:19:44.780 --> 01:19:46.980]   'cause I was buying prescription sunglasses.
[01:19:46.980 --> 01:19:49.180]   So these are actually the ones that I end up getting.
[01:19:49.180 --> 01:19:50.980]   So I tried them on, I said, oh, yeah, yeah,
[01:19:50.980 --> 01:19:52.980]   looked in the mirror, I asked my friends,
[01:19:52.980 --> 01:19:54.060]   what do you think?
[01:19:54.060 --> 01:19:55.860]   Then we tried some other ones on,
[01:19:55.860 --> 01:19:57.540]   and then they've got a prepaid mailer,
[01:19:57.540 --> 01:20:01.340]   you send it back, and then within just a short period of time,
[01:20:01.340 --> 01:20:05.060]   you get your own glasses with your own prescription
[01:20:05.060 --> 01:20:06.380]   right there.
[01:20:06.380 --> 01:20:07.340]   They don't have to be prescription,
[01:20:07.340 --> 01:20:08.300]   they have sunglasses too.
[01:20:08.300 --> 01:20:09.500]   The free home try-on is great,
[01:20:09.500 --> 01:20:11.740]   in fact, when you use the offer code MAC break,
[01:20:11.740 --> 01:20:13.060]   you'll get expedited shipping,
[01:20:13.060 --> 01:20:14.940]   and the turnaround will be even faster.
[01:20:14.940 --> 01:20:17.180]   So yeah, you just pick a pair,
[01:20:17.180 --> 01:20:19.540]   I want Superman, Clark Kent glasses, I love that,
[01:20:19.540 --> 01:20:20.660]   I think that's hysterical.
[01:20:20.660 --> 01:20:22.060]   They have monocles too.
[01:20:22.060 --> 01:20:23.500]   Are the monocles back in stock?
[01:20:23.500 --> 01:20:25.340]   Click the monocle up there at the top,
[01:20:25.340 --> 01:20:27.020]   the chat, it's on the menu bar.
[01:20:27.020 --> 01:20:29.340]   'Cause they were out of stock,
[01:20:29.340 --> 01:20:30.340]   'cause they were so popular,
[01:20:30.340 --> 01:20:31.620]   you couldn't do the try-on, can you do?
[01:20:31.620 --> 01:20:33.140]   Yeah, you can't, good.
[01:20:33.140 --> 01:20:34.540]   So if you want the Colonel,
[01:20:34.540 --> 01:20:38.780]   only $50, look how good you'll look.
[01:20:38.780 --> 01:20:39.900]   You think that's a joke?
[01:20:39.900 --> 01:20:41.820]   No, no, my friend.
[01:20:41.820 --> 01:20:42.980]   You may have Google Glass,
[01:20:42.980 --> 01:20:43.980]   but I've got Google Monocle.
[01:20:43.980 --> 01:20:46.020]   You can put like five mustaches to try as well.
[01:20:46.020 --> 01:20:47.700]   They should send you the mustaches.
[01:20:47.700 --> 01:20:51.100]   I think Andy, you need a monocle.
[01:20:51.100 --> 01:20:54.540]   Isn't that great?
[01:20:54.540 --> 01:20:57.020]   W-A-R-B-Y,
[01:20:57.020 --> 01:21:00.180]   P-A-R-K-E-R dot com.
[01:21:00.180 --> 01:21:01.500]   Just go there, browse around,
[01:21:01.500 --> 01:21:03.540]   if you see some frames you wanna try,
[01:21:03.540 --> 01:21:07.620]   use the offer code MAC break for expedited shipping,
[01:21:07.620 --> 01:21:09.420]   and you'll get your trial box,
[01:21:09.420 --> 01:21:10.420]   and a great pair,
[01:21:10.420 --> 01:21:12.060]   I'm really happy with my warbies.
[01:21:12.060 --> 01:21:13.060]   I love 'em.
[01:21:13.060 --> 01:21:14.100]   That's what I'm gonna call 'em warbies.
[01:21:14.100 --> 01:21:15.700]   You know where the name comes from?
[01:21:15.700 --> 01:21:19.400]   This is a test of your literary acumen.
[01:21:19.400 --> 01:21:22.620]   Anybody?
[01:21:22.620 --> 01:21:25.580]   Two of, you wouldn't probably know this.
[01:21:25.580 --> 01:21:28.900]   Apparently they're fans of Jack Kerouac,
[01:21:28.900 --> 01:21:33.060]   and the names did not appear in any of his published works,
[01:21:33.060 --> 01:21:34.620]   but in his personal journals,
[01:21:34.620 --> 01:21:37.060]   Zag Parker and Warby Pepper.
[01:21:38.060 --> 01:21:41.940]   And they liked the name so much they took it as their name,
[01:21:41.940 --> 01:21:42.780]   but they do feel like,
[01:21:42.780 --> 01:21:45.660]   'cause since Kerouac inspired a generation
[01:21:45.660 --> 01:21:47.540]   to take the road less traveled,
[01:21:47.540 --> 01:21:49.780]   and to see the world through different lenses,
[01:21:49.780 --> 01:21:51.420]   that there might be a good name for their company.
[01:21:51.420 --> 01:21:52.260]   Isn't that great?
[01:21:52.260 --> 01:21:53.340]   I like these guys a lot,
[01:21:53.340 --> 01:21:54.340]   and I really like their product.
[01:21:54.340 --> 01:21:55.180]   You're gonna like it too.
[01:21:55.180 --> 01:21:56.460]   Warby Parker dot com,
[01:21:56.460 --> 01:21:59.940]   use the offer code MAC break for expedited shipping.
[01:21:59.940 --> 01:22:01.260]   I love my warbies.
[01:22:01.260 --> 01:22:03.300]   This is the box.
[01:22:03.300 --> 01:22:04.780]   Well, see, you get the shipping label.
[01:22:04.780 --> 01:22:06.140]   I never sent it back.
[01:22:06.140 --> 01:22:07.300]   (laughs)
[01:22:07.300 --> 01:22:08.140]   I missed it.
[01:22:08.140 --> 01:22:10.140]   But do send it back.
[01:22:10.140 --> 01:22:11.420]   They allowed me to keep it,
[01:22:11.420 --> 01:22:12.260]   because they said,
[01:22:12.260 --> 01:22:14.460]   "Well, you can show it just so people see what you get
[01:22:14.460 --> 01:22:16.620]   when you do the home trial."
[01:22:16.620 --> 01:22:20.180]   Moving along.
[01:22:20.180 --> 01:22:21.660]   I'm not gonna talk about the ebook trial.
[01:22:21.660 --> 01:22:23.380]   It's moving along.
[01:22:23.380 --> 01:22:26.540]   They got smoking, gun, emails from Steve Jobs.
[01:22:26.540 --> 01:22:28.260]   It turned out not to be smoking, gun.
[01:22:28.260 --> 01:22:31.180]   It wasn't really, it was a discarded draft.
[01:22:31.180 --> 01:22:34.900]   The whole issue with this trial,
[01:22:34.900 --> 01:22:36.500]   which is ongoing right now,
[01:22:36.500 --> 01:22:39.380]   is that before Apple came along with the iBook store,
[01:22:39.380 --> 01:22:43.260]   eBooks, price was basically set by Amazon.
[01:22:43.260 --> 01:22:44.860]   They just said, "No, we're gonna charge nine and nine,
[01:22:44.860 --> 01:22:45.700]   and that's it."
[01:22:45.700 --> 01:22:47.860]   And publishers take it or leave it.
[01:22:47.860 --> 01:22:49.100]   And since there was no choice,
[01:22:49.100 --> 01:22:50.740]   Amazon had a massive monopoly,
[01:22:50.740 --> 01:22:54.620]   they took it, along comes Apple,
[01:22:54.620 --> 01:22:55.540]   and they say, "Hey, you know what?
[01:22:55.540 --> 01:22:57.140]   You can price it any way you want to,
[01:22:57.140 --> 01:22:59.980]   as long as it's within a certain reasonable limit,
[01:22:59.980 --> 01:23:01.780]   the so-called agency pricing model.
[01:23:01.780 --> 01:23:03.980]   We take a cut, just as they do with iTunes.
[01:23:03.980 --> 01:23:04.820]   You set the,
[01:23:04.820 --> 01:23:06.260]   actually iTunes is the other way, isn't it?
[01:23:06.260 --> 01:23:07.620]   iTunes is a fixed price.
[01:23:07.620 --> 01:23:10.260]   Similar to the App Store model.
[01:23:10.260 --> 01:23:12.260]   App Store would be a better model, right.
[01:23:12.260 --> 01:23:16.700]   And all of the publishers have now settled,
[01:23:16.700 --> 01:23:18.620]   it's just Apple as the loan defendant,
[01:23:18.620 --> 01:23:21.820]   but Amazon and others are claiming price fixing.
[01:23:21.820 --> 01:23:23.180]   Even though if you ask me,
[01:23:23.180 --> 01:23:26.500]   this seems like a fair thing to do,
[01:23:26.500 --> 01:23:28.700]   but let the publishers decide.
[01:23:28.700 --> 01:23:31.300]   Anyway, I don't know what more to say about that.
[01:23:31.300 --> 01:23:35.060]   Apple's commitment to customer privacy,
[01:23:35.060 --> 01:23:39.780]   some took this page on Apple's website.
[01:23:39.780 --> 01:23:44.780]   This is in response to the NSA spying issue.
[01:23:44.780 --> 01:23:49.900]   And everybody has responded to Facebook, Google, and so forth.
[01:23:49.900 --> 01:23:53.460]   Apple says, "Between December 1st, 2012 and May 31st
[01:23:53.460 --> 01:23:56.740]   of this year, they received four to 5,000 requests
[01:23:56.740 --> 01:23:58.340]   from the US law enforcement.
[01:23:58.340 --> 01:24:02.060]   That's everybody from the feds on down to local police,
[01:24:02.060 --> 01:24:03.460]   because, and that's the way everybody's doing it,
[01:24:03.460 --> 01:24:06.020]   they have to mush these numbers together.
[01:24:06.020 --> 01:24:08.420]   Between 9,000 and 10,000 accounts or devices
[01:24:08.420 --> 01:24:10.500]   are specified in those requests,
[01:24:10.500 --> 01:24:11.940]   but they point out,
[01:24:11.940 --> 01:24:14.140]   the most common former request comes from police
[01:24:14.140 --> 01:24:16.460]   investigating robberies and other crimes,
[01:24:16.460 --> 01:24:18.580]   searching for missing children,
[01:24:18.580 --> 01:24:21.740]   trying to locate a patient with Alzheimer's disease,
[01:24:21.740 --> 01:24:23.100]   or hoping to prevent a suicide.
[01:24:23.100 --> 01:24:25.540]   So it's not always an NSL letter.
[01:24:25.540 --> 01:24:26.740]   They're not allowed to break out
[01:24:26.740 --> 01:24:28.540]   the number of NSL letters, however.
[01:24:28.540 --> 01:24:32.740]   And Apple says, "We are committed to customer privacy.
[01:24:32.740 --> 01:24:33.820]   We've always placed a priority
[01:24:33.820 --> 01:24:35.860]   in protecting our customers' personal data.
[01:24:35.860 --> 01:24:38.820]   We do not collect or maintain a mountain of personal details
[01:24:38.820 --> 01:24:41.220]   about our customers in the first place.
[01:24:41.220 --> 01:24:42.860]   There are certain categories of information
[01:24:42.860 --> 01:24:45.100]   which we do not provide to law enforcement
[01:24:45.100 --> 01:24:48.700]   or any other group because we choose not to retain it."
[01:24:48.700 --> 01:24:51.380]   For example, conversations which take place
[01:24:51.380 --> 01:24:55.700]   over iMessage and FaceTime are protected by end-to-end encryption,
[01:24:55.700 --> 01:24:58.660]   so no one but the sender or receiver can read them.
[01:24:58.660 --> 01:25:01.060]   Now this is the answer to the question that we had.
[01:25:01.060 --> 01:25:03.700]   "Apple cannot decrypt that data."
[01:25:03.700 --> 01:25:08.100]   - Yep, absolutely. - That's interesting.
[01:25:08.100 --> 01:25:11.060]   - I've heard that's absolutely true as well.
[01:25:11.060 --> 01:25:15.380]   - Similarly, we do not store data related to customers' location,
[01:25:15.380 --> 01:25:20.500]   map searches or Siri requests in any identifiable form.
[01:25:20.500 --> 01:25:23.740]   As we know, that doesn't mean it can't be identified
[01:25:23.740 --> 01:25:24.820]   if you get enough of that data,
[01:25:24.820 --> 01:25:28.820]   but they don't match your name to your Siri request.
[01:25:28.820 --> 01:25:29.940]   - It's not court of their business.
[01:25:29.940 --> 01:25:32.020]   - Right. We'll continue to work hard to strike the right balance
[01:25:32.020 --> 01:25:34.980]   between fulfilling our legal responsibilities
[01:25:34.980 --> 01:25:37.620]   and protecting our customers' privacy as they expect and deserve.
[01:25:37.620 --> 01:25:39.620]   This seems like a good statement from Apple.
[01:25:39.620 --> 01:25:40.660]   Pretty clear.
[01:25:40.660 --> 01:25:46.100]   - Yeah. And it's also a very, very long-awaited response
[01:25:46.100 --> 01:25:50.820]   to things like a Patriot Act that we all have known.
[01:25:50.820 --> 01:25:53.380]   I think a lot of the, a lot of the
[01:25:53.380 --> 01:25:56.100]   "ick factor" of domestic surveillance
[01:25:56.100 --> 01:25:59.540]   has been that we have these agencies that now have these broad powers
[01:25:59.540 --> 01:26:01.940]   to observe our, our transactions,
[01:26:01.940 --> 01:26:04.660]   but they don't have to talk about how they're using it,
[01:26:04.660 --> 01:26:06.340]   how many times they're using it.
[01:26:06.340 --> 01:26:09.540]   Companies that are give up that give up this information
[01:26:09.540 --> 01:26:12.260]   don't have the ability to provide their own reports.
[01:26:12.260 --> 01:26:15.780]   And it's just great that now these companies who,
[01:26:15.780 --> 01:26:17.780]   maybe the public perception was, "Oh, look,
[01:26:17.780 --> 01:26:18.980]   they're arm in arm with the government.
[01:26:18.980 --> 01:26:20.020]   They don't care about privacy."
[01:26:20.020 --> 01:26:21.380]   They're saying, "Well, look, we can't do that
[01:26:21.380 --> 01:26:23.060]   because we don't, we don't want to go to jail.
[01:26:23.060 --> 01:26:24.420]   But now that we have the ability to do this,
[01:26:24.420 --> 01:26:27.860]   we, yes, we can give you a finer-grained answer
[01:26:27.860 --> 01:26:30.260]   to the question of what do we do with your data,
[01:26:30.260 --> 01:26:31.620]   what happens to it?"
[01:26:31.620 --> 01:26:34.100]   And so, imaginations can really,
[01:26:34.100 --> 01:26:37.540]   can really go wild when you think about how badly
[01:26:37.540 --> 01:26:39.220]   this kind of thing could be abused.
[01:26:39.220 --> 01:26:42.260]   And so, it's understandable that people are sort of
[01:26:42.260 --> 01:26:43.780]   gravitating towards the worst-case scenario.
[01:26:43.780 --> 01:26:46.820]   So, it's great, it's great that companies are now getting empowered
[01:26:46.820 --> 01:26:48.740]   to actually talk more directly about this sort of thing.
[01:26:48.740 --> 01:26:54.340]   I will point out that Steve Gibson on Wednesday talked a little bit about his
[01:26:54.340 --> 01:26:58.020]   suppositions and not based in fact, of course,
[01:26:58.020 --> 01:27:00.580]   because nobody really knows about what Prism's up to.
[01:27:00.580 --> 01:27:02.020]   But one of the things he's supposed,
[01:27:02.020 --> 01:27:05.700]   and I think that more and more we're starting to see evidence that he was accurate,
[01:27:05.700 --> 01:27:09.860]   is that in fact, the NSA and the feds don't go directly to Apple,
[01:27:09.860 --> 01:27:13.380]   Google, Microsoft, and Yahoo, and watch what's going on in the servers.
[01:27:13.380 --> 01:27:14.500]   But it doesn't mean they can't,
[01:27:14.500 --> 01:27:17.220]   they just go upstream a little bit to their internet service providers,
[01:27:17.220 --> 01:27:18.500]   and they capture the data there.
[01:27:18.500 --> 01:27:24.260]   So, Apple may rightly say, "No, as they have in Facebook and Google too,
[01:27:24.260 --> 01:27:25.940]   they're not in our servers, what are you talking about?"
[01:27:25.940 --> 01:27:32.260]   But if they're tapping cogent or level three right at the source,
[01:27:32.260 --> 01:27:34.740]   they're getting all the same data as if they were in Apple servers.
[01:27:34.740 --> 01:27:39.700]   So, just this while there's response from Apple is welcome,
[01:27:39.700 --> 01:27:43.700]   don't assume it doesn't mean that you aren't being spied on.
[01:27:43.700 --> 01:27:46.260]   We don't know what's going on.
[01:27:46.260 --> 01:27:48.420]   That's the truth of it.
[01:27:48.420 --> 01:27:53.300]   And I turned on, you know, there's a, well, I'll save it for my pick.
[01:27:53.860 --> 01:27:55.700]   This is a very easy way to encrypt your Apple mail.
[01:27:55.700 --> 01:27:57.380]   You might as well do that.
[01:27:57.380 --> 01:28:02.260]   How about picks of the week?
[01:28:02.260 --> 01:28:03.060]   You want to do that, guys?
[01:28:03.060 --> 01:28:05.140]   Please, sure.
[01:28:05.140 --> 01:28:07.620]   Couple of real quick notes before we get to that.
[01:28:07.620 --> 01:28:12.180]   From Microsoft Office, Office Mobile for the iPhone is now available.
[01:28:12.180 --> 01:28:16.980]   In the App Store, if you are an Office 365 home premium or ProPlus subscriber,
[01:28:16.980 --> 01:28:19.220]   that's good news.
[01:28:20.340 --> 01:28:24.820]   You can now look at, I guess, documents.
[01:28:24.820 --> 01:28:25.300]   And lightly edit.
[01:28:25.300 --> 01:28:30.340]   And lightly edit documents in Office on the iPhone.
[01:28:30.340 --> 01:28:33.540]   Worst product name ever and no iPad version.
[01:28:33.540 --> 01:28:34.100]   Yeah.
[01:28:34.100 --> 01:28:35.460]   Office Mobile for iPhone.
[01:28:35.460 --> 01:28:38.340]   I think it's the whole, on the App Store, it says something like,
[01:28:38.340 --> 01:28:40.740]   Office 360 for Office subscription.
[01:28:40.740 --> 01:28:45.620]   Well, they want to emphasize that it's not any good to you if you don't do the monthly
[01:28:45.620 --> 01:28:46.420]   subscription, which I do.
[01:28:46.420 --> 01:28:47.460]   So, I'll try it.
[01:28:48.660 --> 01:28:48.980]   Right.
[01:28:48.980 --> 01:28:55.220]   AT&T is starting to roll out FaceTime over cellular.
[01:28:55.220 --> 01:28:57.940]   So, that's interesting.
[01:28:57.940 --> 01:29:00.740]   That means that that limitation was an Apple's limitation.
[01:29:00.740 --> 01:29:03.620]   The carriers didn't want you to use 3G for FaceTime.
[01:29:03.620 --> 01:29:07.700]   So, if you have an AT&T iPhone, watch for it.
[01:29:07.700 --> 01:29:11.540]   Both LTE and HSPA+ support for FaceTime.
[01:29:11.540 --> 01:29:15.220]   It's interesting because we got MMS a year in Canada before you got it in the US.
[01:29:15.220 --> 01:29:18.180]   And we had FaceTime over cellular for a long time.
[01:29:18.180 --> 01:29:20.660]   It's their evil companies to you there, Leo.
[01:29:20.660 --> 01:29:21.940]   Yeah, it's the phone company.
[01:29:21.940 --> 01:29:22.420]   Blame them.
[01:29:22.420 --> 01:29:26.340]   It's interesting because like FaceTime, I thought I was rolling out for a while now.
[01:29:26.340 --> 01:29:28.820]   The FaceTime over cellular for AT&T.
[01:29:28.820 --> 01:29:31.060]   Verizon for sure is at it for a while.
[01:29:31.060 --> 01:29:32.180]   Maybe they're just expanding it.
[01:29:32.180 --> 01:29:34.420]   It wasn't nationwide.
[01:29:34.420 --> 01:29:37.460]   I didn't like to select places.
[01:29:37.460 --> 01:29:38.500]   Yeah, it was like in Maryland.
[01:29:38.500 --> 01:29:41.700]   In FaceTime in Maryland.
[01:29:41.700 --> 01:29:41.940]   Yeah.
[01:29:41.940 --> 01:29:47.300]   And BMW says, "We ain't going to change the architecture of our cars for Apple."
[01:29:47.300 --> 01:29:47.780]   Well, maybe.
[01:29:48.660 --> 01:29:49.620]   Oh, yeah.
[01:29:49.620 --> 01:29:50.740]   They're pointing out in the chat room.
[01:29:50.740 --> 01:29:53.700]   I forgot to mention that Microsoft Office doesn't seem to be international yet.
[01:29:53.700 --> 01:29:54.340]   It seems to...
[01:29:54.340 --> 01:29:55.860]   Oh, you know.
[01:29:55.860 --> 01:29:56.900]   It's just weird.
[01:29:56.900 --> 01:29:59.460]   These companies, these companies just don't.
[01:29:59.460 --> 01:30:06.020]   It was everywhere, but with the 4S and 5, and now it's with the 4, okay.
[01:30:06.020 --> 01:30:10.420]   I'm just reading an Apple Insider article.
[01:30:10.420 --> 01:30:11.140]   What do I know?
[01:30:11.140 --> 01:30:13.220]   I don't use FaceTime.
[01:30:15.860 --> 01:30:16.740]   You have to now, Leo.
[01:30:16.740 --> 01:30:19.140]   It's the only way to have encrypted voice communications.
[01:30:19.140 --> 01:30:20.660]   It just saves that in the letter.
[01:30:20.660 --> 01:30:20.900]   Right.
[01:30:20.900 --> 01:30:22.260]   It's safe.
[01:30:22.260 --> 01:30:24.900]   Let us move on to our picks of the week.
[01:30:24.900 --> 01:30:27.300]   I don't know if, if Mark, if anybody told you,
[01:30:27.300 --> 01:30:29.780]   but we'd like to pick something that we are excited about,
[01:30:29.780 --> 01:30:31.380]   you have anything you'd like to talk about?
[01:30:31.380 --> 01:30:32.580]   Yeah, for sure.
[01:30:32.580 --> 01:30:33.780]   Chad gave me the whole rundown.
[01:30:33.780 --> 01:30:39.540]   I've been using about.me premium for a week now.
[01:30:39.540 --> 01:30:41.060]   Does that fulfill what a pick is?
[01:30:41.060 --> 01:30:42.420]   That fulfills what a pick is.
[01:30:42.420 --> 01:30:43.540]   I actually like about.me.
[01:30:43.540 --> 01:30:45.300]   What does the premium service add?
[01:30:45.300 --> 01:30:46.180]   Well, it's great.
[01:30:46.180 --> 01:30:48.020]   I've been using the free one for a few years,
[01:30:48.020 --> 01:30:51.140]   and it easily lets you make a profile website about yourself.
[01:30:51.140 --> 01:30:54.980]   And the premium version allows you to connect your own domain name to it.
[01:30:54.980 --> 01:30:58.580]   So it integrates well, and you can also drop some of the advertising.
[01:30:58.580 --> 01:31:03.300]   So it's a really quick way to put a nice, clean website about yourself online.
[01:31:03.300 --> 01:31:05.060]   So this is my about.me page.
[01:31:05.060 --> 01:31:08.340]   Wow, it's pretty nice for them, Mark.
[01:31:08.340 --> 01:31:10.260]   It says, "I am president of the internet."
[01:31:10.260 --> 01:31:14.580]   They don't do a lot of background checking.
[01:31:14.580 --> 01:31:15.780]   You can say anything you want.
[01:31:15.780 --> 01:31:20.980]   What's nice about this is it's a good looking kind of single page
[01:31:20.980 --> 01:31:23.140]   that can be your business card on the internet.
[01:31:23.140 --> 01:31:26.820]   And the problem was it was always about.me/yourname,
[01:31:26.820 --> 01:31:29.860]   and now you can make it be 9 to 5 Mac.
[01:31:29.860 --> 01:31:31.620]   There's Mark Gurman's, "Look, I like the boat."
[01:31:31.620 --> 01:31:34.740]   Thanks, that's one of the stock.
[01:31:34.740 --> 01:31:36.420]   Once you can choose, right, and you can see,
[01:31:36.420 --> 01:31:40.740]   I don't have the top bar at the top like yours had, the about.me branding.
[01:31:40.740 --> 01:31:41.620]   That's because you're pro.
[01:31:41.620 --> 01:31:42.820]   Right, right.
[01:31:42.820 --> 01:31:45.620]   So you get that as well if you connect your domain through the premium.
[01:31:45.620 --> 01:31:46.900]   Cool, cool, cool.
[01:31:46.900 --> 01:31:49.300]   I'm going to have to do that.
[01:31:49.300 --> 01:31:50.180]   How much is the premium?
[01:31:50.180 --> 01:31:54.180]   There's a few different tiers, but I think they're all under $10.
[01:31:54.180 --> 01:31:54.740]   Oh, it's pricey.
[01:31:54.740 --> 01:31:58.100]   $4 a month for the basic.
[01:31:58.100 --> 01:31:59.940]   Wow.
[01:31:59.940 --> 01:32:04.260]   When you think about it, it takes care of the hosting.
[01:32:04.260 --> 01:32:08.100]   So only thing you're paying extra is the domain.
[01:32:08.100 --> 01:32:11.380]   So I guess in the long run, perhaps, and it's really convenient, nice.
[01:32:11.380 --> 01:32:14.020]   And you can also, they have a really, really good iPhone app.
[01:32:14.020 --> 01:32:15.460]   So you can control the whole thing from there.
[01:32:15.460 --> 01:32:17.060]   All right.
[01:32:17.060 --> 01:32:18.420]   Cool.
[01:32:18.420 --> 01:32:19.060]   All right.
[01:32:19.060 --> 01:32:21.140]   Yeah, it's for somebody who doesn't want to do a website.
[01:32:21.140 --> 01:32:22.900]   This is a good way to do it.
[01:32:22.900 --> 01:32:24.900]   About.me.
[01:32:24.900 --> 01:32:28.420]   Mr. Renee Richie, your pick of the week.
[01:32:28.420 --> 01:32:33.140]   My pick of the week, it just came out as the show was starting.
[01:32:33.140 --> 01:32:34.100]   Aren't you current?
[01:32:34.100 --> 01:32:36.820]   I was hoping, because sometimes I get burned.
[01:32:36.820 --> 01:32:39.460]   Sometimes I wait and the app gets delayed and then I have to scramble.
[01:32:39.460 --> 01:32:41.300]   But in this case, it actually worked out.
[01:32:41.300 --> 01:32:43.620]   And that might be because it's not on the Mac app.
[01:32:43.620 --> 01:32:45.700]   I don't believe it's on the Mac app store.
[01:32:45.700 --> 01:32:48.420]   It's called Chautology.
[01:32:48.420 --> 01:32:52.020]   It's by FlexiBits, who does Fantastic Al.
[01:32:52.020 --> 01:32:53.780]   I love FlexiBits.
[01:32:53.780 --> 01:32:56.340]   They are absolutely fantastic.
[01:32:56.340 --> 01:32:59.780]   And the nice thing about this app is if you've ever used,
[01:32:59.780 --> 01:33:02.740]   there's a lot of problems with messages on Mac, a lot of problems.
[01:33:02.740 --> 01:33:05.620]   But one of them is that if you start typing a search to find something,
[01:33:05.620 --> 01:33:06.900]   the whole thing just freezes.
[01:33:06.900 --> 01:33:09.300]   It makes iTunes look snappy and performant.
[01:33:09.300 --> 01:33:11.780]   And it can take forever to find anything.
[01:33:11.780 --> 01:33:15.700]   So what Michael and Kent did is they went in and they just started,
[01:33:15.700 --> 01:33:20.820]   they figured out a way to take all that data and make it instantly searchable.
[01:33:20.820 --> 01:33:24.420]   So you launch Chautology, you start typing and stuff, and it just works.
[01:33:24.420 --> 01:33:27.460]   And I've had people send me pictures while I was in Chautology.
[01:33:27.460 --> 01:33:31.700]   And it applied to my filter term and it just popped up in the thing.
[01:33:31.700 --> 01:33:34.580]   And you can choose categories, you can choose terms.
[01:33:34.580 --> 01:33:41.460]   They just all, it's the fastest, easiest way to filter through anything that is in messages.
[01:33:41.460 --> 01:33:46.500]   And I've been using it so much that it's just become almost like a default window.
[01:33:46.500 --> 01:33:50.180]   Whenever I'm looking to remember something, I have it open and it tells me,
[01:33:50.180 --> 01:33:54.420]   what happens? I've been beta testing it for a month and a half and it's worked flawlessly
[01:33:54.420 --> 01:33:56.100]   the entire time.
[01:33:56.100 --> 01:34:01.940]   So if you're a heavy messages on Mac user and you've been frustrated by the inability to quickly
[01:34:01.940 --> 01:34:04.580]   find the people you were talking to or the contents of the messages,
[01:34:04.580 --> 01:34:08.580]   I used it to find passwords. People don't like emailing me passwords,
[01:34:08.580 --> 01:34:10.820]   especially for servers or for secure things.
[01:34:10.820 --> 01:34:13.700]   So they'll send them to me over my messages instead.
[01:34:13.700 --> 01:34:16.180]   And now I can just type in a quick couple things.
[01:34:16.180 --> 01:34:20.580]   I get that password or I get the name that I was missing or the little piece of information or
[01:34:20.580 --> 01:34:23.780]   the URL that I want or the image that was sent to me.
[01:34:23.780 --> 01:34:30.340]   And it's not one of those big flashy apps like Fantasticelle that replaces an entire app.
[01:34:30.340 --> 01:34:35.060]   But boy, does it make it get rid of a lot of frustration and hurdles and usability.
[01:34:35.060 --> 01:34:41.060]   $20, but you could try for free at Flexibits, F-L-E-X-I-B-I-T-S.com.
[01:34:41.060 --> 01:34:45.140]   Chateology. All right, I'll give it a try. Thank you.
[01:34:45.140 --> 01:34:47.540]   Mr. Naco, your pick of the week.
[01:34:47.540 --> 01:34:52.180]   My pick of the week is a fun little toy. It's called Siro.
[01:34:52.180 --> 01:34:53.380]   Oh, it's a ball.
[01:34:53.380 --> 01:34:55.380]   And it's a magic happy fun ball.
[01:34:55.380 --> 01:34:57.780]   And it's kind of hard to demonstrate.
[01:34:57.780 --> 01:34:58.740]   I have two of those.
[01:34:58.740 --> 01:35:04.740]   Yeah, essentially, think of it as like a hamster ball, where inside this plastic ball is a little
[01:35:04.740 --> 01:35:09.700]   four-wheeled robot. And so when you control it via your iPhone, right now, because I don't
[01:35:09.700 --> 01:35:13.780]   want it to roll away, I've just got it set up to like, through the iPhone, I can just change
[01:35:13.780 --> 01:35:18.020]   its color. But you put it on the ground and it will roll in any direction you want. You can steer
[01:35:18.020 --> 01:35:22.420]   it. As a matter of fact, when I was just configuring it about 10 minutes ago, I set it on the ground
[01:35:22.420 --> 01:35:26.580]   and just rolled away because it has to verify now, did I just roll away from you?
[01:35:26.580 --> 01:35:29.460]   Yes, you did. But now I'm in my chair and I can't get. Oh, wait a minute.
[01:35:29.460 --> 01:35:33.700]   This is a robot. I could actually like just pilot it around the room and steer it right back to
[01:35:33.700 --> 01:35:40.980]   the chair. This is fun. So it's just there. It's a $99 toy. And there are a lot of robots you can buy
[01:35:40.980 --> 01:35:45.620]   for less than $99. But the cool thing is that this is a ball that you can like put in a bag or put
[01:35:45.620 --> 01:35:49.380]   in a pocket and you've got your phone with you all the time. So you can use it in so many different
[01:35:49.380 --> 01:35:54.340]   ways and so many different places. And also, there are a bunch of games that they've they've
[01:35:54.340 --> 01:35:59.060]   opened up by API so that third parties can develop games for it. And some of them are pretty cool.
[01:35:59.060 --> 01:36:07.220]   There's a game in which this on the this on the ground is not just simply the the Svero like with
[01:36:07.220 --> 01:36:13.700]   a robot. It's actually uses a color to use the camera of your iPad or your iPhone as a marker of
[01:36:13.700 --> 01:36:18.340]   here's where I should now draw in this live video of your actual living room or your driveway,
[01:36:18.340 --> 01:36:23.620]   a picture of a scampering rodent. So you're actually basically controlling a cartoon rodent that in
[01:36:23.620 --> 01:36:28.820]   video is just walking walking and running all through your all through your house. So as a ball,
[01:36:28.820 --> 01:36:33.700]   there's just a whole bunch of fun. It's it's it's this comes in the category of something that I was
[01:36:33.700 --> 01:36:39.620]   sent in a box by a PR company and then put it aside and start playing with it and then start
[01:36:39.620 --> 01:36:44.260]   playing more with it and start playing more with it because it is happy fun ball. So how many how
[01:36:44.260 --> 01:36:51.140]   many balls do you have? One, but it's pretty big. I'm sorry. You need more than one. I mean,
[01:36:51.140 --> 01:36:56.020]   could you just play with one? You can play you can you can play with just one. You can play in teams.
[01:36:56.020 --> 01:37:00.020]   Each one with a different pair to a different Bluetooth phone. You can also there are also
[01:37:00.020 --> 01:37:05.140]   games that use this basically as a controller that will sense your position and as you're shaking
[01:37:05.140 --> 01:37:10.580]   and as you're moving it around. There are only about a couple dozen games I think in the iOS app
[01:37:10.580 --> 01:37:15.220]   store that use it. It's also available for Android, by the way, the excuse me, there's also an app
[01:37:15.220 --> 01:37:20.660]   and Android app for it as well. So but it's just you know, deceptively fun. It's not until you
[01:37:20.660 --> 01:37:23.540]   actually have when you realize that, okay, this would be kind of something to screw around with.
[01:37:23.540 --> 01:37:28.980]   As a matter of I'm glad it didn't arrive about a month and a half ago when I was traveling
[01:37:28.980 --> 01:37:33.140]   for like a week and traveling through like multiple airports because the temptation to just
[01:37:33.140 --> 01:37:37.540]   have this in my bag and just use it to amuse myself waiting for you know, an hour and 10 minutes in
[01:37:37.540 --> 01:37:43.140]   the terminal for my flight would have been far far too much to for immature immature person like
[01:37:43.140 --> 01:37:48.340]   me to turn down. I'd have to be I'd have to be talking to like a 53 year old person. Hi,
[01:37:48.340 --> 01:37:53.380]   Mr. Can I have my ball back it rolled down your old past your piece of luggage there.
[01:37:53.380 --> 01:37:58.500]   Now I want all of them. Yeah, they're fun. I just saw them a couple of years ago at CES.
[01:37:58.500 --> 01:38:01.540]   They've been they've been rolling around. They get better in Bear Mackerel. I think it was a Mac
[01:38:01.540 --> 01:38:08.180]  kerel actually. We saw this Fiero SPH ERO Sfiro. In fact, do we did we do a review on before you buy?
[01:38:08.980 --> 01:38:16.580]   I think we did. We'll see if we can find the episode number. My tip is actually for anybody who's
[01:38:16.580 --> 01:38:21.620]   afraid about the of the NSA spying on their email. I've been trying to get people to use PGP forever
[01:38:21.620 --> 01:38:28.900]   and then later the open source version, GNU privacy guard or GPG. Now there is a really easy
[01:38:28.900 --> 01:38:35.380]   way to use it on on Apple mail and I highly recommend it. This couldn't be simpler. They
[01:38:35.380 --> 01:38:39.620]   now works with Mountain Lion. You know, it's an open source project. So, you know, it comes and goes.
[01:38:39.620 --> 01:38:49.380]   This is from GPGtools.org absolutely free. You'll download it. Install it. What it will do is it
[01:38:49.380 --> 01:38:56.180]   will generate a new key pair public and private key. Install it in your OS 10 key chain and
[01:38:56.180 --> 01:39:04.740]   automatically add to Apple mail the ability to encrypt and sign your mail. So a new GPG mail
[01:39:04.820 --> 01:39:17.780]   is setting is in your preferences. You can easily sign all your mail, which I have done for years
[01:39:17.780 --> 01:39:22.020]   once you generate the key pair. It's a good idea to upload the key pair to a key server. You might
[01:39:22.020 --> 01:39:28.020]   have a key signing party. Get other people who know it's you for sure to sign your key. So if you find
[01:39:28.020 --> 01:39:36.900]   a key that is Leo at LeoVille.com and has a comment, twit.tv/leo in it. And I should give you some more
[01:39:36.900 --> 01:39:40.580]   information so I get you to sign my key actually people who are watching at home. I know a lot of
[01:39:40.580 --> 01:39:47.860]   people are familiar with the idea of PGP. What's cool is if you get an email from me it should be
[01:39:47.860 --> 01:39:56.820]   signed by me. You'll see it. It adds the private and public key into the key chain here. And you
[01:39:56.820 --> 01:40:05.460]   can add other people's keys to your key chain. Mine is 89898B67. So if you see a key with a short ID
[01:40:05.460 --> 01:40:12.180]   89898B67 would you do me a favor and say, "Yeah, that's Leo. I heard him say it on the twit network."
[01:40:12.180 --> 01:40:18.340]   Now if somebody sends me their public key in a signature of an email or so forth,
[01:40:18.340 --> 01:40:26.740]   now we can have encrypted conversations that not even the NSA can peer into. It's very easy.
[01:40:26.740 --> 01:40:31.380]   The installer works perfectly smoothly. Highly recommended. If you're still using Apple
[01:40:31.380 --> 01:40:35.620]   Mail, I know a lot of you now have moved to Web Mail and that's unfortunate because I don't
[01:40:35.620 --> 01:40:41.620]   know of a good way to do this yet in Gmail on the web. But if you use Apple Mail it's a really
[01:40:41.620 --> 01:40:46.580]   simple, easy way to add encryption and signing. Signing is important too to verify you sent that
[01:40:46.580 --> 01:40:55.620]   email to all of your mail. Highly recommended. It's from gpgtools.org and it is free. There
[01:40:55.620 --> 01:41:01.140]   are solutions for Gmail. Two full dogs says MailVolope is one.
[01:41:01.140 --> 01:41:05.220]   You think it'd be possible, Leo? A good friend of mine keeps asking me this. If Apple or Google
[01:41:05.220 --> 01:41:09.460]   could just start installing this by default and making work in such a way that it spawns
[01:41:09.460 --> 01:41:13.300]   mainstream adoption of it. I wish that what Outlook has the capability to do with the SMIM
[01:41:13.300 --> 01:41:21.380]   secure encryption using certificates. But it's not turned on to my knowledge anywhere and I think
[01:41:21.380 --> 01:41:25.780]   it would really be nice. I like my mom to be secure without having to install all this stuff.
[01:41:25.780 --> 01:41:30.500]   Well, you know, what happens when I do it? I have one hell of a lemon bar recipe.
[01:41:30.500 --> 01:41:36.180]   No, but the point is if everybody uses encrypted mail and secure mail, then it doesn't. It's not
[01:41:36.180 --> 01:41:43.220]   a red flag anymore. So it's very simple for me to once you install it, you'll see when I create a
[01:41:43.220 --> 01:41:50.260]   new message, I've got just a built-in thing here that I can digitally sign by clicking that.
[01:41:50.260 --> 01:41:55.380]   And you see it gives me a chance to do it with OpenPGP or SMIM. Those are both industry standards.
[01:41:55.380 --> 01:42:00.420]   I can also, if I'm sending it to somebody who's key I have, public key I have, encrypted.
[01:42:00.420 --> 01:42:05.860]   And so this just get these two buttons, just get added automatically to every message you send out.
[01:42:05.860 --> 01:42:12.820]   And by default, I sign everything that I send out. Some of this exists on other platforms.
[01:42:12.820 --> 01:42:17.860]   I think Samsung smartphones have mail signing as well. And it's a good thing. You can export
[01:42:17.860 --> 01:42:23.140]   your keys. You could put your public key somewhere. People can download it. Like on a web page,
[01:42:23.140 --> 01:42:27.860]   I've always kept my public key and my Leo Villa count, or you can search the MIT key server.
[01:42:27.860 --> 01:42:33.460]   There are many key servers out there, PGP key servers, then say, hey, what is Leo's key and find
[01:42:33.460 --> 01:42:40.980]   it and then encrypt mail to me because that's a way to get my public key as well. The private key is
[01:42:43.700 --> 01:42:49.860]   password protected or pass better yet pass phrase protected. You probably don't want to distribute
[01:42:49.860 --> 01:42:54.740]   it nevertheless. Your public key you can distribute widely. I could actually put it on the screen here.
[01:42:54.740 --> 01:42:58.180]   Maybe I put it in a QR code, something like that. I think it might be too long for that.
[01:42:58.180 --> 01:43:02.660]   But please, you know, if you're worried about privacy, there are tools. I don't even think
[01:43:02.660 --> 01:43:06.260]   your mom would have too much trouble getting this to work. They've really made it easy now.
[01:43:06.260 --> 01:43:10.820]   GPGTools.org. I want to thank our panelists. Mark, I want to thank you for coming. I hope you
[01:43:10.820 --> 01:43:16.580]   come back soon. Thank you so much for having me. It was great. Nice to have the young folk
[01:43:16.580 --> 01:43:23.940]   occasionally on the show. But you know, you got to be more forceful with this crowd because we're
[01:43:23.940 --> 01:43:30.820]   big talkers. No, no, just assertiveness. That's all assertiveness. It was great having you. We
[01:43:30.820 --> 01:43:34.020]   read you all the time. We're always quoting you. So thanks for doing such a great job.
[01:43:34.020 --> 01:43:37.780]   And I'll have you back real soon. Thanks to Renee Richie. I'm more.com. You guys are doing
[01:43:37.780 --> 01:43:43.300]   your event right now. I saw Callie and John posting some stuff. Yeah, absolutely. And Leo is going
[01:43:43.300 --> 01:43:47.700]   to be on Talk Mobile tomorrow. So if you want to see Leo's contribution, which was awesome,
[01:43:47.700 --> 01:43:52.820]   thank you very much for that, Leo. It'll be on talkmobile2013.com tomorrow. And it's all about
[01:43:52.820 --> 01:43:58.260]   apps in the future of HTML5 and cross-platform and a lot of fun stuff. It's hosted by mobile
[01:43:58.260 --> 01:44:02.340]   nations presented by Blackberry and online events spanning the mobile nations network.
[01:44:03.140 --> 01:44:09.140]   So it covers Android, Blackberry, Windows, as well as iOS. A lot of fun. A lot of fun.
[01:44:09.140 --> 01:44:11.700]   The best thing that we did is like we usually have all these separate sites like I'm more
[01:44:11.700 --> 01:44:15.460]   and Android Central and no one talks to each other. So we built this new comment system where no
[01:44:15.460 --> 01:44:19.620]   matter which site you're on, all your comments are together. So and we're not asking you to
[01:44:19.620 --> 01:44:23.780]   fight about platform. We're asking about bigger issues that apply to all of us. So it's working
[01:44:23.780 --> 01:44:27.540]   really well. We're getting amazing comments on the articles. Excellent. Well done.
[01:44:27.540 --> 01:44:33.060]   Talk. What is it? Talkmobile2013.com? Yes, sir. All right. Thank you, Renee.
[01:44:33.220 --> 01:44:37.700]   See you next week. Thanks to Andy and Akko as well. Andy, now looking back,
[01:44:37.700 --> 01:44:45.060]   or do you feel bad that you didn't get to WWDC? Not really because I was able to get all my
[01:44:45.060 --> 01:44:50.420]   coverage in. There was a lot of stuff going on, but not a whole lot that I felt that I missed
[01:44:50.420 --> 01:44:54.340]   that I would be able to write about. And there were plenty of opportunities in the past week for
[01:44:54.340 --> 01:44:59.540]   me to get that information away. So it's absolutely hands-on demo lab. There's really,
[01:44:59.540 --> 01:45:04.500]   you don't need to be there. Yeah. I mean, the fall event, I think, is really important,
[01:45:04.500 --> 01:45:10.420]   extremely valuable to get to the other one. If you can arrange for someone who does the sort
[01:45:10.420 --> 01:45:15.460]   of writing that I do where I have to be free to be writing about various subjects, you have to
[01:45:15.460 --> 01:45:19.780]   really do a lot of work in advance and make sure that you have lots of other things that you can
[01:45:19.780 --> 01:45:24.180]   visit and take care of over there. And also the fact that there was also two different
[01:45:24.740 --> 01:45:30.900]   Sony and Microsoft all Keynote at E3, there would have been a considerable amount of pain for me to
[01:45:30.900 --> 01:45:37.300]   be. So there's nothing. The only thing to match the joy of being in San Francisco at WWDC with
[01:45:37.300 --> 01:45:42.740]   so much interesting stuff going on. And so my friends there is the absolute abject displeasure
[01:45:42.740 --> 01:45:46.820]   of saying, Hi, yeah, I really wish that I could go out to dinner with you, be my first time here
[01:45:46.820 --> 01:45:50.900]   in eight months, but I have to stay here and watch something on live stream and write about it in
[01:45:50.900 --> 01:45:54.740]   my hotel. That's why I came to San Francisco to stay in my hotel and work.
[01:45:54.740 --> 01:46:04.740]   This is the only thing you missed is the size of the Mac Pro. And you're now seeing it. So you're done.
[01:46:04.740 --> 01:46:11.540]   You didn't even get the secret weapon gafferty. Well, I'll tell you what, we will fly out this
[01:46:11.540 --> 01:46:16.340]   fall. How about that? If Apple should happen to have an event, we'll bring you. We will. We will
[01:46:16.340 --> 01:46:22.500]   play on that. All right. It's. Thank you, Andy. Thank you all for joining us. We do Mac break
[01:46:22.500 --> 01:46:27.220]   weekly whenever the hell I get here. But it's usually sometime between 11 and noon on Tuesday.
[01:46:27.220 --> 01:46:36.980]   That's Pacific time. That's around 2 p.m. Eastern time, 1900 UTC on twit.tv. Tune in and join us
[01:46:36.980 --> 01:46:41.220]   live if you can. If you can't, don't worry, we make on demand audio and video available after the fact
[01:46:41.220 --> 01:46:48.660]   at twit.tv/mbw or wherever finer podcasts are stored, aggregated and dispersed to the general
[01:46:48.660 --> 01:46:57.140]   populace. Thank you for being here. Now get back to work because break time is over.
