[00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000]   This is the show where we say IO.
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   Yes, Mr. Andy Macau is here from Sweltering Hot New England.
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   Hello Andrew.
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   Hello Leo.
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.000]   You know, you could almost write ad copy for like a local furniture store.
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   (Laughter)
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   IOU?
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   We say IO.
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   Yes.
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   This sectional can be yours.
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   Actually, for many years, it's exactly what I did.
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   So I guess it does it.
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   Those skills die hard.
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   Anyway, great to have you.
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   Thank you for joining us today.
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   And I love the picture behind you of Princess Leia.
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.000]   Is that a drawing?
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   It looks like a painting.
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   It is a drawing by our spending name of Patrick Schone,
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   Schone maker S.E.
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   I want to make sure I credited him.
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   S-C-H-O-E-N-M-A-K-E-R.
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   He does really wonderful like art prints of like Lucasfilm.
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   Lucasfilm things.
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   But also this is an undock, a scene that was of course,
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   but it wasn't part of the movie of, you know,
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   Leia being captured and being presented to Jabba.
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   Right.
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   And every single character from the palace is there to sort of snickering and,
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   oh goodness, it's wonderful.
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   (Laughter)
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   Always, Andy always gives us something interesting to look at.
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   If you listen to the audio version, most of you do, I know.
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   Sometimes just download the video and look at Andy's backdrops are always good.
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   It's to distract from my lack of coherence.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   (Laughter)
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   Well, it's working because I think you're perfectly coherent.
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   And over on my right hand side, you're left on the screen from a back room somewhere in London, England.
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   This looks like a scene out of Brazil, Mr. Alex Lindsay, Pixel Core.
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   Hello, Alex.
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   Hello.
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   I am, yeah, hidden.
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   There's a bunch of production, but I'm going the wrong way.
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   You've been in London for two whole weeks.
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   You could practically call it home.
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   You know, I've actually, this is, I've been here finally long enough where I actually understand
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   where everything is and where everything else.
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   So I'm kind of like figuring out, you know, where all the pieces are.
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   And I'm only going to be home for 10 or 12 days and then back here again for more.
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   So, I'm...
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   England's been out of that place to spend time.
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   It's really, it's really pretty fun.
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   Especially this time of year.
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   Yeah, it's beautiful.
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   It's really hot.
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:03.000]   Like, I came, you know, I kind of, I told someone, you know, if I wanted sun and warmth,
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   I would have just stayed in California.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   (Laughter)
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:06.000]   I came here expecting rain.
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   I came with layers.
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   And it's just been swelled through hot.
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   How about you, Simon?
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   It's kind of chilly here, actually.
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   You're better off.
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   (Laughter)
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:15.000]   Windy, too.
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   Very windy here.
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   So, Mac Book Rumors is getting stronger and stronger.
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   The latest, and this is the kind of thing that, you know, we here in the ink stained media
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:37.000]   are always looking for a price drop on the 2012 Mac book, at least at Best Buy.com.
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   That's commonly, is it not Andy a symptom of a upcoming product?
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000]   A new product in that category.
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:47.000]   It's only $100.
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   Yeah, because I mean, it's not $200 on the higher cost.
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   It's better to eat $100 right now than eat like $300, $300, $400 when, you know, Apple's
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   going to be selling these things direct with much, much better specs at the same price.
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:01.000]   Right.
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000]   Yeah, that's usually one of the things.
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000]   There are two things that you do look out for.
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:09.000]   Number one, you can't buy these things at any price, which means that Apple stopped making
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:13.000]   them a few months ago in anticipation of a release, or that the price suddenly dropped,
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:17.360]   which means that suddenly certain stores know something that no one else knows, and they
[00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:20.000]   want to make sure they lose all their stock before the new model comes out.
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:21.000]   Right.
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000]   Now, this is Best Buy, not Apple itself.
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   Right.
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   And then Apple probably would not drop the price themselves.
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.000]   They would venture other channels to lose that product.
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.000]   And also, you know, what better information about the channel?
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:35.000]   Does anybody have an Apple?
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.000]   They tend not to be caught with excess inventory.
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:42.000]   They presumably have stopped making them for some time and, you know, just tripping out
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:43.000]   the last ones.
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:47.240]   They know exactly how many they sell every day, and they've got just enough to get to when,
[00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:50.480]   next week, two weeks, WWDC is two weeks off.
[00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:54.640]   But I don't, I think we agree that they're not going to announce a new hardware line at
[00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:55.640]   WWDC.
[00:05:55.640 --> 00:06:01.480]   They could, they could just use that opportunity in that audience, just to simply roll out
[00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:03.120]   new notebooks.
[00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:08.040]   Remember that notebooks are kind of unusual in that you tend to want to get your new models
[00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:13.240]   out early enough so that all the schools that have to order in bulk or order large supplies
[00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:16.000]   of them can get their orders in, in time for the school year.
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:20.240]   That's a little bit, the person who first explained that to me a few years ago explained
[00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:23.160]   that usually that happens sometime in May.
[00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:28.640]   But that's usually the reason why when I look at the timetables for shipping new systems,
[00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:35.360]   I tend to think April, May, June as opposed to September, October, November.
[00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:37.200]   You know, they do a keynote, of course, the beginning of WWDC.
[00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:38.520]   But they've got lots to talk about.
[00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:40.160]   They've got iOS 6 to talk about.
[00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:43.080]   They've got mountain, snow leopard, lion thing.
[00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:44.080]   What is it?
[00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:48.600]   The only reason that I think that it might be something that they would possibly show
[00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:52.600]   new machines is if there's something about mountain lion that is going to take advantage
[00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:53.600]   of some of the new machines.
[00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:57.240]   And so that it is, so there's a contextual reason to, to bring that up.
[00:06:57.240 --> 00:06:58.240]   Good point.
[00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:02.720]   And that's where the higher resolution display might be, might play a factor.
[00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:03.720]   Right.
[00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:04.720]   Yeah.
[00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:05.720]   I mean, that's possible.
[00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:06.720]   Go ahead, Andy.
[00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:13.040]   I'm saying, I'll always going to say is that it's a new hardware is rarely a sort of demo
[00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:17.400]   where a CEO or someone high up demonstrates a feature and then goes boom, and then waits
[00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:18.400]   for the applause.
[00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:20.520]   It's more like, yes, the processor is faster.
[00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:22.600]   Yes, the design is a little bit slimmer.
[00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:26.640]   Yes, the battery lasts just long, even though the design is a little bit slimmer.
[00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:30.000]   It's not the sort of thing where you necessarily would need to bring everybody out to town
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.240]   hall for for an hour long document, Dr. Pony Show.
[00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:37.520]   But if you already have like a 90 minute presentation that you need to fill, that's
[00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:40.960]   mostly going to be developer stuff and mostly going to be OS stuff, you may as well use
[00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:43.760]   10 minutes of that time to say, oh, here's the new Macbooks.
[00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:45.360]   Here's the table of prices.
[00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:48.640]   And now let's talk about our new Bangladesh Apple store.
[00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:50.080]   We're very proud of the design here.
[00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:53.120]   It's shaped like a nougat.
[00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:55.680]   And then that's our on the inside.
[00:07:55.680 --> 00:08:01.020]   I think that this is, this is an example of, of an upgrade that a lot of people might be
[00:08:01.020 --> 00:08:05.160]   waiting for a fairly major upgrade, not merely a new chipset.
[00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:09.760]   We'll have a new chipset, probably Ivy Bridge, but a new form factor, which we haven't seen
[00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:17.440]   on the MacBook line for some time, a thinner, according to the rumors, diskless, dare we
[00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:21.760]   say, profile and of course a higher res display.
[00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:25.440]   Isn't though Alex, isn't OS 10 resolution independent anyway?
[00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:29.280]   I mean, you could you could run it on any size screen like most computers.
[00:08:29.280 --> 00:08:34.140]   Well, I think that it's, it can run on any size, but I don't think that we've really
[00:08:34.140 --> 00:08:40.100]   seen true resolution independence, the way that I think is being promised, which is that
[00:08:40.100 --> 00:08:43.580]   it's automatically trying to keep everything the same size, the text the same size.
[00:08:43.580 --> 00:08:48.180]   I mean, that's always been the big challenge if you have a little bit of a rough time reading
[00:08:48.180 --> 00:08:52.380]   small text moving to 1920 by 1200 might be a little bit more of a challenge.
[00:08:52.380 --> 00:08:55.580]   And so I think that one of the things that is going to be interesting in the new operating
[00:08:55.580 --> 00:09:00.220]   system is whether that is going to keep everything relatively the same size, but just have it
[00:09:00.220 --> 00:09:02.060]   all be a lot sharper.
[00:09:02.060 --> 00:09:05.260]   And I think that, you know, and then when you change whatever, whatever resolution is going
[00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:09.820]   to the relative size of the text of the images, all of that stays the same, which in a lot
[00:09:09.820 --> 00:09:15.500]   of ways, if it works well, is a huge advantage for designers because you're designing for
[00:09:15.500 --> 00:09:19.060]   a space rather than a specific pixel set of pixels.
[00:09:19.060 --> 00:09:22.060]   And finally, all those people that don't understand pixels, everything will start making
[00:09:22.060 --> 00:09:24.100]   sense because they no longer can say, well, it's right.
[00:09:24.100 --> 00:09:25.100]   Half inches wide.
[00:09:25.100 --> 00:09:29.260]   And we always say, well, how many pixels is it designed, you know, and all of that goes
[00:09:29.260 --> 00:09:33.100]   away and you really just make it whatever size you're going to make it.
[00:09:33.100 --> 00:09:38.540]   And according to digit times and about whom we've of course talked fast about their, you
[00:09:38.540 --> 00:09:43.660]   know, legendary accuracy, according to digit times, Apple's massive orders for the next
[00:09:43.660 --> 00:09:48.540]   generation MacBook Pros are causing havoc for its supply chain with many facing labor
[00:09:48.540 --> 00:09:52.380]   shortages as they struggle to meet demand.
[00:09:52.380 --> 00:09:56.540]   Those have been forced to outsource their businesses at desperate attempt to complete orders before
[00:09:56.540 --> 00:09:58.780]   they start shipping.
[00:09:58.780 --> 00:09:59.900]   Sources for digit times are revealed.
[00:09:59.900 --> 00:10:05.180]   The component manufacturing plants in eastern China have been taken by surprise in what
[00:10:05.180 --> 00:10:08.580]   is usually the IT industry's traditional slow season.
[00:10:08.580 --> 00:10:09.580]   Apparently not.
[00:10:09.580 --> 00:10:11.700]   - Evidently everyone was on vacation.
[00:10:11.700 --> 00:10:14.540]   Everyone was everyone at that box gun was taking a take.
[00:10:14.540 --> 00:10:16.500]   - We're not here right now.
[00:10:16.500 --> 00:10:18.460]   Please leave a message at the phone.
[00:10:18.460 --> 00:10:24.500]   If you've got a new computer, we'll be back after the holiday.
[00:10:24.500 --> 00:10:29.340]   Labor shortages mean many are unable to meet demand while others have had to call for help
[00:10:29.340 --> 00:10:30.420]   from other suppliers.
[00:10:30.420 --> 00:10:35.660]   A new notebooks entered production back in April, according to the report when suppliers began
[00:10:35.660 --> 00:10:38.420]   delivering its chassis.
[00:10:38.420 --> 00:10:44.460]   Production ramps up in June, ready for the new MacBooks possibly launched in July.
[00:10:44.460 --> 00:10:49.100]   - I have to say, we might as well just throw this out.
[00:10:49.100 --> 00:10:52.460]   Did you see, first of all, we talked, I think last week or the week before about Harry McCracken's
[00:10:52.460 --> 00:10:56.340]   great piece in time in Time magazine in which he went through, in fact Harry was on Twitter
[00:10:56.340 --> 00:10:57.340]   on this on Sunday.
[00:10:57.340 --> 00:10:58.380]   I should have thanked him for that.
[00:10:58.380 --> 00:11:02.780]   He went through one by one all the rumors from digit times and they were pretty bad.
[00:11:02.780 --> 00:11:04.260]   Digitimes actually responded.
[00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:08.540]   Joseph Chen, deputy managing editor, wrote to Harry and said, "Thank you for writing
[00:11:08.540 --> 00:11:09.540]   about us."
[00:11:09.540 --> 00:11:12.980]   Digitimes has indeed reported much on Apple and many of the products that we said would
[00:11:12.980 --> 00:11:16.780]   be launched have never been launched or have had their launches delayed.
[00:11:16.780 --> 00:11:20.660]   But that does not mean we were crying wolf or passing along gossip.
[00:11:20.660 --> 00:11:24.820]   In fact, Apple have had a lot of its R&D projects and ideas tried out at its supply chain
[00:11:24.820 --> 00:11:26.060]   partners in Asia.
[00:11:26.060 --> 00:11:28.900]   Many of the prototypes created by the supply chain partners will never make it to the market
[00:11:28.900 --> 00:11:30.460]   after Apple assessments.
[00:11:30.460 --> 00:11:33.540]   This is one of the major reasons why a lot of information we have disclosed has been seen
[00:11:33.540 --> 00:11:37.980]   by others as inaccurate but is still valuable to our reader base in the supply chain.
[00:11:37.980 --> 00:11:40.460]   We understand the risks behind the kind of reporting.
[00:11:40.460 --> 00:11:41.460]   So they're saying.
[00:11:41.460 --> 00:11:45.460]   By the way, says in the future, we will implement even stricter requirements for verifications
[00:11:45.460 --> 00:11:46.460]   of such stories.
[00:11:46.460 --> 00:11:50.380]   We'll also add more analyses to such stories for five readers of the more.
[00:11:50.380 --> 00:11:58.300]   You cannot say that we can't fill orders for this five MacBook Pros we're going to
[00:11:58.300 --> 00:11:59.300]   make.
[00:11:59.300 --> 00:12:05.460]   I don't know if I buy this apology and I don't know if I buy this story but I do believe,
[00:12:05.460 --> 00:12:10.220]   deep in my heart, my heart of hearts, that Apple will have an Ivy Bridge MacBook Pro.
[00:12:10.220 --> 00:12:11.340]   I don't think it'll be July.
[00:12:11.340 --> 00:12:13.540]   I think it'll be soon.
[00:12:13.540 --> 00:12:14.540]   I wouldn't buy it.
[00:12:14.540 --> 00:12:15.540]   Let's put it this way.
[00:12:15.540 --> 00:12:16.540]   I wouldn't buy a laptop now.
[00:12:16.540 --> 00:12:17.540]   Right?
[00:12:17.540 --> 00:12:18.540]   How about airs?
[00:12:18.540 --> 00:12:20.740]   Do you think they'll update the ears?
[00:12:20.740 --> 00:12:22.540]   I know.
[00:12:22.540 --> 00:12:23.540]   That's a different thing.
[00:12:23.540 --> 00:12:27.220]   I mean, the MacBook Pros are up for a much bigger refresh than the ears are.
[00:12:27.220 --> 00:12:30.260]   Last year was a really a breakthrough year for the airline.
[00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:35.900]   But this I would be surprised if Apple didn't at least give it a tweak because they seem
[00:12:35.900 --> 00:12:38.300]   to be on like annual updates for just about everything.
[00:12:38.300 --> 00:12:39.940]   I've got with Ivy Bridge.
[00:12:39.940 --> 00:12:42.060]   My only thing, I guess Ivy Bridge is a lot hotter.
[00:12:42.060 --> 00:12:43.260]   It might not be suitable.
[00:12:43.260 --> 00:12:44.260]   Yeah.
[00:12:44.260 --> 00:12:49.380]   I mean, it's an obvious choice for the Pro line, not necessarily an obvious choice for
[00:12:49.380 --> 00:12:50.380]   the ears.
[00:12:50.380 --> 00:12:51.380]   Right.
[00:12:51.380 --> 00:12:55.980]   I think it's an obvious upgrade for the Mac Pros.
[00:12:55.980 --> 00:13:00.020]   Yeah, that's exactly what I'm saying.
[00:13:00.020 --> 00:13:03.300]   But I mean, the MacBook Pros I think we're definitely going to see an update.
[00:13:03.300 --> 00:13:05.060]   Well, the Mac Pros you're talking about.
[00:13:05.060 --> 00:13:07.660]   Well, where is the Mac Pro?
[00:13:07.660 --> 00:13:10.820]   Because Ivy Bridge for the desktop has been out for a month.
[00:13:10.820 --> 00:13:12.420]   Where is the Mac Pro?
[00:13:12.420 --> 00:13:13.820]   We just want one more upgrade.
[00:13:13.820 --> 00:13:14.820]   I'm wondering.
[00:13:14.820 --> 00:13:16.820]   You know, I'm wondering what Thunderbolt.
[00:13:16.820 --> 00:13:17.820]   Yeah.
[00:13:17.820 --> 00:13:23.780]   I now know two photographers and videographers who are building hackintoshes because they
[00:13:23.780 --> 00:13:27.300]   want Ivy Bridge and they're not necessarily convinced that there's going to be a Mac Pro
[00:13:27.300 --> 00:13:31.540]   that's going to be worth whatever additional weight there's going to be for them.
[00:13:31.540 --> 00:13:32.780]   Wow.
[00:13:32.780 --> 00:13:34.740]   That's kind of interesting.
[00:13:34.740 --> 00:13:39.140]   Even though firmware support for Ivy Bridge, even in the hackintosh line is sketchy at
[00:13:39.140 --> 00:13:40.340]   best.
[00:13:40.340 --> 00:13:45.140]   But these people are willing to spend about $1,400, $1,500 to build what is a kick butt,
[00:13:45.140 --> 00:13:50.260]   like seven bay tower because they're convinced that if they want Ivy Bridge sooner rather
[00:13:50.260 --> 00:13:52.420]   than later, they're going to have to do it themselves.
[00:13:52.420 --> 00:13:53.420]   Strikes me.
[00:13:53.420 --> 00:13:56.620]   We're going to have to get, I'll get a chip expert on next week because we need to, we
[00:13:56.620 --> 00:14:00.580]   need to, we'll get an on or somebody to talk about Ivy Bridge next week because I think
[00:14:00.580 --> 00:14:05.780]   if you're going to understand where Apple's going with its next generation of desktops
[00:14:05.780 --> 00:14:09.980]   and laptops, you need to understand Ivy Bridge, which is the current Intel system on it.
[00:14:09.980 --> 00:14:13.980]   Well, it's not exactly the system on it, but the Ivy Bridge does not run hotter since
[00:14:13.980 --> 00:14:15.540]   MavHC, but of course it runs hotter.
[00:14:15.540 --> 00:14:18.420]   If you overclock it, it runs a lot hotter.
[00:14:18.420 --> 00:14:24.020]   The laptop part, I presume the mobile part is not so hot.
[00:14:24.020 --> 00:14:29.140]   And upon my wonders, see, there must, there is more in the Ivy Bridge that Apple could
[00:14:29.140 --> 00:14:34.420]   say, hey, and to take advantage of USB 3, for instance, architecture built in Ivy Bridge,
[00:14:34.420 --> 00:14:35.420]   we're going to add USB 3.
[00:14:35.420 --> 00:14:36.420]   I think maybe you're right.
[00:14:36.420 --> 00:14:39.500]   I think there does need to be some explanation about this particular jump.
[00:14:39.500 --> 00:14:40.500]   Yeah.
[00:14:40.500 --> 00:14:46.500]   And a lot of it, I just, just the other day I had occasion to compare the previous generation
[00:14:46.500 --> 00:14:53.380]   MacBook with the previous Intel CPU with like the 2011 model because I had to, I had to
[00:14:53.380 --> 00:14:57.380]   read, I had to take my previous MacBook out of storage because I needed a piece of software
[00:14:57.380 --> 00:14:59.980]   that wasn't, I didn't have the license code for anymore.
[00:14:59.980 --> 00:15:03.740]   So I actually had to take this thing out of the closet and recharge it just to run this
[00:15:03.740 --> 00:15:05.180]   one app.
[00:15:05.180 --> 00:15:08.580]   And that's when I realized that my goodness, I'm sitting on the sofa with this thing on
[00:15:08.580 --> 00:15:11.780]   my lap and I'm being using this machine for 90 minutes.
[00:15:11.780 --> 00:15:17.940]   And like my foot is not like fried to a crisp because the CPU is just, is just a cooler running
[00:15:17.940 --> 00:15:18.940]   CPU.
[00:15:18.940 --> 00:15:23.300]   Rast with my 2011 era of MacBook Pro, I actually have a special like thermal pad that I slide
[00:15:23.300 --> 00:15:27.300]   underneath it just so that I can like sit comfortably on the sofa with a thing.
[00:15:27.300 --> 00:15:32.500]   So that could be, that could be another, another element of how to stick this chip inside a
[00:15:32.500 --> 00:15:37.220]   mobile, a mobile machine or, or even on a desktop that could be an issue.
[00:15:37.220 --> 00:15:41.940]   I mean, you don't want to, it was Apple going to have their first like cray style tower liquid
[00:15:41.940 --> 00:15:44.700]   cooling pyramid on top of it.
[00:15:44.700 --> 00:15:46.860]   They did look at cooling for a brief moment.
[00:15:46.860 --> 00:15:47.860]   Didn't they on the Mac Pro?
[00:15:47.860 --> 00:15:48.860]   Yeah.
[00:15:48.860 --> 00:15:49.860]   Yeah.
[00:15:49.860 --> 00:15:52.580]   There's a G5 at least was, was, was liquid cooled.
[00:15:52.580 --> 00:15:55.740]   Now there's others were, but maybe, maybe that's, maybe that's actually like that, that
[00:15:55.740 --> 00:16:00.300]   really wonderful to like, the glass cylinder, like, and the, and one of the China stores.
[00:16:00.300 --> 00:16:03.340]   Maybe that's just like a prototype for what's going to be like at the top of every season.
[00:16:03.340 --> 00:16:08.500]   It's going to be like a mis-refusion like tower on the top of every Mac pro now.
[00:16:08.500 --> 00:16:09.740]   You get to choose the color.
[00:16:09.740 --> 00:16:12.860]   Aria, you, you guys are on Facebook, right?
[00:16:12.860 --> 00:16:13.860]   Sure.
[00:16:13.860 --> 00:16:15.860]   I have an account that I haven't deleted.
[00:16:15.860 --> 00:16:16.860]   No.
[00:16:16.860 --> 00:16:25.340]   Well, here's a chance to join the massive petition, Facebook.com/MacProsePlease.
[00:16:25.340 --> 00:16:28.820]   We want a new Mac Pro 12,790 likes.
[00:16:28.820 --> 00:16:32.220]   I'm going to add my, my link to the likes.
[00:16:32.220 --> 00:16:33.700]   Hello, Apple.
[00:16:33.700 --> 00:16:36.780]   We are the creative community and we are looking for a little clarity on one of our favorite
[00:16:36.780 --> 00:16:39.420]   products, the Mac Pro tower.
[00:16:39.420 --> 00:16:41.180]   Is that too much to ask?
[00:16:41.180 --> 00:16:42.580]   Signed a Lube-Rella.
[00:16:42.580 --> 00:16:43.580]   So there you go.
[00:16:43.580 --> 00:16:44.580]   There you go.
[00:16:44.580 --> 00:16:49.740]   Now, now picking up steam at a Facebook page near you.
[00:16:49.740 --> 00:16:52.980]   I'm sure there are other petitions.
[00:16:52.980 --> 00:16:55.300]   It was launched on May 8th.
[00:16:55.300 --> 00:16:56.300]   So it's doing all right.
[00:16:56.300 --> 00:16:57.300]   Apparently I had 20.
[00:16:57.300 --> 00:17:00.460]   Of course, everybody on that list bought a Mac Pro.
[00:17:00.460 --> 00:17:04.100]   It would be, it would be, it would be, it would make about as much money as they make
[00:17:04.100 --> 00:17:06.780]   selling iPhones at the San Francisco store in a day.
[00:17:06.780 --> 00:17:09.060]   That's the problem.
[00:17:09.060 --> 00:17:10.060]   I'm a realist.
[00:17:10.060 --> 00:17:11.060]   Yeah.
[00:17:11.060 --> 00:17:14.060]   So maybe, maybe what we need to do is get a million on.
[00:17:14.060 --> 00:17:15.060]   What would be the number?
[00:17:15.060 --> 00:17:16.980]   What would be the magic number?
[00:17:16.980 --> 00:17:18.900]   I think a million would get their attention.
[00:17:18.900 --> 00:17:20.300]   A million people.
[00:17:20.300 --> 00:17:23.980]   But remember, and I've had this experience ourselves, you know, here at Twit, people
[00:17:23.980 --> 00:17:29.020]   will say, we demand, we want, we get thousands of people saying, we want, I don't know what,
[00:17:29.020 --> 00:17:31.940]   a gaming show, and then nobody watches it.
[00:17:31.940 --> 00:17:36.540]   So it's easy to say we want, I want commitment to buy.
[00:17:36.540 --> 00:17:38.020]   That's what I want if I'm Apple.
[00:17:38.020 --> 00:17:43.940]   We commit, why don't, as an Apple do a Kickstarter and says we will make a new Mac Pro if we get
[00:17:43.940 --> 00:17:46.140]   a million people who buy one.
[00:17:46.140 --> 00:17:51.180]   If a million people do it, Tim Cook will take off his shirt and send you a nice picture.
[00:17:51.180 --> 00:17:52.180]   Exactly.
[00:17:52.180 --> 00:17:56.060]   That's what Apple needs to do, a Kickstarter campaign for the Mac Pro.
[00:17:56.060 --> 00:18:00.340]   I do think that there is just a massive pent up demand for the Mac Pro.
[00:18:00.340 --> 00:18:04.580]   There's so many of us that are holding on to our production systems, just waiting for
[00:18:04.580 --> 00:18:08.380]   one more upgrade, knowing that there's only going to be one more upgrade, and, you know,
[00:18:08.380 --> 00:18:11.380]   just really ready to jump on it and buy a couple of machines.
[00:18:11.380 --> 00:18:15.500]   And so I think it would be pretty a pretty lucrative process for Apple.
[00:18:15.500 --> 00:18:18.180]   I think probably enough to make it worth it, but seeing.
[00:18:18.180 --> 00:18:19.180]   Yeah.
[00:18:19.180 --> 00:18:21.460]   All right, we're going to take a break.
[00:18:21.460 --> 00:18:25.140]   Andy Enoco, Alex Lindsey, Leo Leport.
[00:18:25.140 --> 00:18:26.620]   We want a Mac Pro here.
[00:18:26.620 --> 00:18:28.260]   There are three people, Apple.
[00:18:28.260 --> 00:18:29.940]   No, see, Andy's too cheap.
[00:18:29.940 --> 00:18:30.940]   He won't buy one.
[00:18:30.940 --> 00:18:31.940]   I won't buy one.
[00:18:31.940 --> 00:18:40.740]   I already have, like eight way Zionna, I7, whatever, 16 triple and it's not even that
[00:18:40.740 --> 00:18:41.740]   fast.
[00:18:41.740 --> 00:18:43.700]   I don't use it for anything.
[00:18:43.700 --> 00:18:45.980]   I use my laptop on the kitchen counter.
[00:18:45.980 --> 00:18:48.180]   Alex will buy 50 though.
[00:18:48.180 --> 00:18:51.340]   I would probably buy at least four or five.
[00:18:51.340 --> 00:18:52.340]   Yeah.
[00:18:52.340 --> 00:18:53.340]   I will say.
[00:18:53.340 --> 00:18:54.340]   Yeah.
[00:18:54.340 --> 00:18:55.340]   So there.
[00:18:55.340 --> 00:18:56.340]   So I'll make up for both of you.
[00:18:56.340 --> 00:18:57.940]   Make him happy because you're right.
[00:18:57.940 --> 00:19:00.140]   Andy and I are not going to commit.
[00:19:00.140 --> 00:19:05.980]   And I think this is part of the problem is I'm perfectly content now to use an iMac or
[00:19:05.980 --> 00:19:07.540]   a laptop.
[00:19:07.540 --> 00:19:10.540]   Well I will say that there's a lot of things that we used to only be able to do.
[00:19:10.540 --> 00:19:13.620]   And Thunderbolt has changed a lot of that for us because a lot of what we used expansion
[00:19:13.620 --> 00:19:14.740]   slots for.
[00:19:14.740 --> 00:19:18.340]   We're now using Thunderbolt components.
[00:19:18.340 --> 00:19:23.020]   And so I think that that is like we used to use Mac Mac Pros for our graphics for doing
[00:19:23.020 --> 00:19:24.380]   on-air graphics.
[00:19:24.380 --> 00:19:32.180]   And now we're using Mac Minis to do the same thing with AJA, I OXT and Blackmagic boxes
[00:19:32.180 --> 00:19:33.180]   and stuff like that.
[00:19:33.180 --> 00:19:37.780]   And that just was totally impossible six months ago.
[00:19:37.780 --> 00:19:39.620]   All right.
[00:19:39.620 --> 00:19:42.980]   One of our chatter says, "Why are they leading with this story?"
[00:19:42.980 --> 00:19:43.980]   So I'm going to tell him.
[00:19:43.980 --> 00:19:45.500]   I'll do your story next.
[00:19:45.500 --> 00:19:49.300]   You tell me what story we should do next.
[00:19:49.300 --> 00:19:51.500]   I think it's because it's a Mac break.
[00:19:51.500 --> 00:19:52.500]   I'm trying to do Mac stories.
[00:19:52.500 --> 00:19:53.500]   We're talking about Macs.
[00:19:53.500 --> 00:19:55.300]   We're talking about Macs.
[00:19:55.300 --> 00:19:57.300]   You know.
[00:19:57.300 --> 00:20:01.780]   So Web 1585, what is your top story?
[00:20:01.780 --> 00:20:05.060]   It's all on you.
[00:20:05.060 --> 00:20:06.060]   And everybody complains about it.
[00:20:06.060 --> 00:20:08.940]   We're going to remember if you fund at the $2,500 level.
[00:20:08.940 --> 00:20:10.700]   I'll send you a topless picture.
[00:20:10.700 --> 00:20:11.700]   We will.
[00:20:11.700 --> 00:20:12.700]   Come on.
[00:20:12.700 --> 00:20:14.980]   And we'll report any story you want.
[00:20:14.980 --> 00:20:18.620]   At the $10,000 level, we will put exactly the spin on it that you bought.
[00:20:18.620 --> 00:20:19.620]   Okay.
[00:20:19.620 --> 00:20:20.620]   He's come up with his next story.
[00:20:20.620 --> 00:20:22.620]   iPhone leaks coming up next.
[00:20:22.620 --> 00:20:23.620]   Leaks what?
[00:20:23.620 --> 00:20:25.340]   What is it leaking?
[00:20:25.340 --> 00:20:26.340]   What is it leaking?
[00:20:26.340 --> 00:20:33.300]   Just a little bit of go on.
[00:20:33.300 --> 00:20:36.180]   But first a word from go to meeting.
[00:20:36.180 --> 00:20:39.540]   I brought my special.
[00:20:39.540 --> 00:20:40.540]   Very special.
[00:20:40.540 --> 00:20:44.060]   I'm meeting barbecue, apron home, or I'd be wearing it right now.
[00:20:44.060 --> 00:20:45.060]   Topless.
[00:20:45.060 --> 00:20:48.380]   Go to meeting is very, very cool.
[00:20:48.380 --> 00:20:52.300]   They came by to show us go to meeting on the iPad the other day and they gave me an apron,
[00:20:52.300 --> 00:20:54.540]   which was very nice.
[00:20:54.540 --> 00:20:56.020]   Go to meeting from Citrix.
[00:20:56.020 --> 00:20:58.540]   They're very I like the Citrix folks a lot.
[00:20:58.540 --> 00:21:00.900]   We invite them up here an awful lot.
[00:21:00.900 --> 00:21:05.700]   And they are just so proud of what they've done with go to meeting and the new HD faces.
[00:21:05.700 --> 00:21:08.740]   It started by using your camera.
[00:21:08.740 --> 00:21:14.220]   In fact, they said we've been getting a lot of requests to do your podcast with go to
[00:21:14.220 --> 00:21:15.220]   meeting.
[00:21:15.220 --> 00:21:19.100]   So I said, if you can get this high quality video, go to meeting with HD faces, video
[00:21:19.100 --> 00:21:23.260]   is amazing into a form that I can use instead of Skype, I'll use it.
[00:21:23.260 --> 00:21:24.260]   I will use it.
[00:21:24.260 --> 00:21:26.100]   But I mean, it's really go to meeting so much more.
[00:21:26.100 --> 00:21:28.340]   It's really about sharing your screen and sharing your picture.
[00:21:28.340 --> 00:21:31.180]   It's for training, collaboration, sales.
[00:21:31.180 --> 00:21:35.780]   There's something about having a client see you, you seeing a client and on the iPad now
[00:21:35.780 --> 00:21:40.140]   too, you'll use the iPad camera to share your video with your client.
[00:21:40.140 --> 00:21:45.260]   They can meet with you on a desktop, a laptop, an iPad or an iPhone.
[00:21:45.260 --> 00:21:46.260]   That's awesome.
[00:21:46.260 --> 00:21:50.380]   And on the iPad, they even send video, not yet on the iPhone, although I can imagine that's
[00:21:50.380 --> 00:21:51.380]   coming.
[00:21:51.380 --> 00:21:54.980]   One of the nice things Citrix says, they always are always upgrading, you know, kind of spontaneously.
[00:21:54.980 --> 00:21:57.700]   $49 a month for as many meetings as you want, as long as you want.
[00:21:57.700 --> 00:22:03.380]   But you could try it free for the first month with the offer code Macbreak, Mac or PC, iPad
[00:22:03.380 --> 00:22:09.580]   or iPhone, there is no better way to meet, collaborate, train, present, then go to meeting
[00:22:09.580 --> 00:22:15.420]   and the new HD faces uses the built-in camera on your laptop.
[00:22:15.420 --> 00:22:17.740]   You works great with the Logitech with any camera.
[00:22:17.740 --> 00:22:19.740]   Just a point and a click and a boom.
[00:22:19.740 --> 00:22:21.300]   You don't have to open any ports or do anything.
[00:22:21.300 --> 00:22:23.340]   It just does it.
[00:22:23.340 --> 00:22:30.940]   Absolutely secure, 228 bit SSL point all the way from you to your Metis.
[00:22:30.940 --> 00:22:38.100]   The Internet telephony product of the year, go to meeting with HD faces according to the
[00:22:38.100 --> 00:22:39.020]   Internet telephony magazine.
[00:22:39.020 --> 00:22:41.220]   And I think rightly so.
[00:22:41.220 --> 00:22:43.180]   I want you to try it today free.
[00:22:43.180 --> 00:22:51.620]   Go to go to meeting.com, click the try it free button, use the offer code Macbreak, Macbreak.
[00:22:51.620 --> 00:22:55.420]   All right, I'm going to go to nine to five Mac.
[00:22:55.420 --> 00:23:02.460]   That's where the top hot new iPhone rumors breaking news, ladies and gentlemen, black
[00:23:02.460 --> 00:23:11.700]   and white next gen metal iPhone backs a photo plus a mini doc, taller screen.
[00:23:11.700 --> 00:23:20.500]   And yes, they've moved the earphone jack.
[00:23:20.500 --> 00:23:23.620]   These are these are good pictures from nine to five Mac.
[00:23:23.620 --> 00:23:26.100]   And you know, of course rumor mill being what it is.
[00:23:26.100 --> 00:23:30.980]   As we get closer though to a product shipping, you often get these kinds of images.
[00:23:30.980 --> 00:23:34.620]   I'm pretty excited about the whole headphone moving rumor.
[00:23:34.620 --> 00:23:37.620]   Where do they put it?
[00:23:37.620 --> 00:23:43.140]   So this is this is a front and a back you're looking at black and white versions.
[00:23:43.140 --> 00:23:44.780]   Actually, no, there's a back in the back, isn't it?
[00:23:44.780 --> 00:23:46.980]   Yeah, they're both backs.
[00:23:46.980 --> 00:23:50.060]   The black and white calling is trim.
[00:23:50.060 --> 00:23:52.660]   A large portion of the black back is made out of metal.
[00:23:52.660 --> 00:23:56.500]   Maybe this is that liquid metal.
[00:23:56.500 --> 00:23:59.860]   It's interesting if they do use metal, first of all, the glass broke.
[00:23:59.860 --> 00:24:04.380]   It was a problem and metal might be better at trans for an antenna, right?
[00:24:04.380 --> 00:24:06.140]   I don't know.
[00:24:06.140 --> 00:24:11.380]   The metal antenna looks like is molded into the metal back plates.
[00:24:11.380 --> 00:24:12.940]   Will they do a unibody enclosure?
[00:24:12.940 --> 00:24:18.820]   Does look like they still have the square ish sides that the iPhone four, but rounded
[00:24:18.820 --> 00:24:23.820]   corners, Apple's famous rounded corners.
[00:24:23.820 --> 00:24:28.220]   The long rumored smaller dock connector is present.
[00:24:28.220 --> 00:24:31.220]   See, I'm not happy about that.
[00:24:31.220 --> 00:24:33.220]   You see that at the bottom?
[00:24:33.220 --> 00:24:34.420]   I have a lot of docs.
[00:24:34.420 --> 00:24:37.300]   I have so many 30 pin connectors and docs.
[00:24:37.300 --> 00:24:39.980]   I don't want them to change this form factor.
[00:24:39.980 --> 00:24:43.340]   That's actually a $200 ad to the cost of the phone for me.
[00:24:43.340 --> 00:24:44.580]   Yeah.
[00:24:44.580 --> 00:24:48.300]   I will not be happy if they do that.
[00:24:48.300 --> 00:24:51.020]   Maybe they'll ship an adapter, but it's still not good because it won't fit in a dock with
[00:24:51.020 --> 00:24:52.020]   an adapter.
[00:24:52.020 --> 00:24:53.020]   Right.
[00:24:53.020 --> 00:24:55.020]   Well, let's go.
[00:24:55.020 --> 00:24:59.940]   She used to make an adapter when they went to the powered pins a few years ago.
[00:24:59.940 --> 00:25:04.340]   Maybe the Apple is not necessarily expecting everybody to replace their phone every single
[00:25:04.340 --> 00:25:08.140]   year.
[00:25:08.140 --> 00:25:13.380]   I would be disappointed if they did it just because somebody inside Apple, inside the
[00:25:13.380 --> 00:25:18.060]   design team said, "We don't want to disturb the harmonious clean lines, but the long
[00:25:18.060 --> 00:25:19.060]   slot anymore."
[00:25:19.060 --> 00:25:22.500]   That's not a good reason to change the dock connector, but if they're putting more signals
[00:25:22.500 --> 00:25:25.580]   on that dock connector, giving it a guy a little bit.
[00:25:25.580 --> 00:25:26.580]   You've got 30 pins.
[00:25:26.580 --> 00:25:28.020]   You could do anything you want.
[00:25:28.020 --> 00:25:29.020]   You've got 30 pins.
[00:25:29.020 --> 00:25:30.020]   Yeah.
[00:25:30.020 --> 00:25:31.020]   You've got power.
[00:25:31.020 --> 00:25:32.020]   You've got audio.
[00:25:32.020 --> 00:25:33.020]   You've got video.
[00:25:33.020 --> 00:25:34.020]   You've got all kinds of stuff.
[00:25:34.020 --> 00:25:35.020]   How much stuff do you want to do?
[00:25:35.020 --> 00:25:36.020]   I mean, this is smaller.
[00:25:36.020 --> 00:25:37.020]   It's got...
[00:25:37.020 --> 00:25:38.020]   So the other thing, and this is where the new...
[00:25:38.020 --> 00:25:42.380]   I see it now, the new earphone connectors on the bottom.
[00:25:42.380 --> 00:25:43.380]   Baa.
[00:25:43.380 --> 00:25:44.380]   Wrong.
[00:25:44.380 --> 00:25:46.860]   Wrong, wrong, wrong.
[00:25:46.860 --> 00:25:52.300]   Remember the old iPod's had a connector on the bottom next to the 30-pin connector?
[00:25:52.300 --> 00:25:53.460]   Your phone next to the three.
[00:25:53.460 --> 00:25:54.940]   Terrible idea.
[00:25:54.940 --> 00:25:58.100]   You can't dock it and use the headphones.
[00:25:58.100 --> 00:26:03.780]   Realize that now when you hold your iPhone, all the cables are now going to be like...
[00:26:03.780 --> 00:26:07.940]   All the cables will be coming out of the bottom so you don't have this sort of like
[00:26:07.940 --> 00:26:08.940]   dangly...
[00:26:08.940 --> 00:26:09.940]   I guess.
[00:26:09.940 --> 00:26:11.820]   It's not this $300 bead on a slim wire.
[00:26:11.820 --> 00:26:16.340]   So I could see why they would want them both coming out of the same end.
[00:26:16.340 --> 00:26:22.260]   That was the one that kind of got me concerned because my single most frequently used iPhone
[00:26:22.260 --> 00:26:24.780]   accessory is my car dock.
[00:26:24.780 --> 00:26:30.460]   And it's a universal dock, but it does have a set of fingers encrypted from the bottom.
[00:26:30.460 --> 00:26:34.700]   And every time that I'm using an Android device that has really weird layout of cables,
[00:26:34.700 --> 00:26:39.780]   I realize that, "Man, I'm going to have to hold it in securely in this thing if at all.
[00:26:39.780 --> 00:26:43.340]   Why did they decide to do anything clever with where these things plug in?"
[00:26:43.340 --> 00:26:45.060]   Yeah, that's a bad problem.
[00:26:45.060 --> 00:26:49.700]   But each person is going to have individual problems no matter where they decide to put
[00:26:49.700 --> 00:26:51.180]   these connectors in.
[00:26:51.180 --> 00:26:53.060]   I'm just hoping that they can...
[00:26:53.060 --> 00:26:54.860]   I'm just hoping that when they...
[00:26:54.860 --> 00:26:58.820]   If this happens and if they roll this out, they will have a functional reason.
[00:26:58.820 --> 00:27:02.420]   They won't just stick an executive out there saying that, "Doesn't it look pretty with
[00:27:02.420 --> 00:27:04.940]   no holes at the top and all the holes at the bottom?"
[00:27:04.940 --> 00:27:06.500]   So I don't care for the time.
[00:27:06.500 --> 00:27:08.940]   If you're getting $300 out of me, I don't care if it's pretty.
[00:27:08.940 --> 00:27:11.860]   I wanted to actually do the job that I needed to do, sir.
[00:27:11.860 --> 00:27:16.300]   I hope this is a bogus rumor, a new grill, big deal.
[00:27:16.300 --> 00:27:18.460]   But here's the other thing I'm not too happy about.
[00:27:18.460 --> 00:27:21.460]   Actually, you'll be happy about Alex.
[00:27:21.460 --> 00:27:26.460]   So we see the camera, we see an LED, and there's something in between the camera and LED.
[00:27:26.460 --> 00:27:29.380]   It looks like a slot for a microphone.
[00:27:29.380 --> 00:27:33.100]   So when you're shooting at the back, there'll be a microphone while you shoot.
[00:27:33.100 --> 00:27:35.380]   That might be the second microphone, the noise canceling microphone.
[00:27:35.380 --> 00:27:36.860]   That would make sense to what that would be about.
[00:27:36.860 --> 00:27:38.340]   No, no, why don't you like that, Leo?
[00:27:38.340 --> 00:27:39.340]   Why is it upset?
[00:27:39.340 --> 00:27:42.780]   Actually, because I shoot the other way.
[00:27:42.780 --> 00:27:45.820]   You shoot the other way?
[00:27:45.820 --> 00:27:47.620]   You talk me to do that.
[00:27:47.620 --> 00:27:50.060]   You know with a tadpole, you look into the camera.
[00:27:50.060 --> 00:27:51.060]   Right, right, right.
[00:27:51.060 --> 00:27:52.060]   Yeah, I understand what you're saying.
[00:27:52.060 --> 00:27:53.060]   It'll still work.
[00:27:53.060 --> 00:27:54.060]   But it makes sense.
[00:27:54.060 --> 00:27:55.060]   It'll still work.
[00:27:55.060 --> 00:27:56.060]   I guess.
[00:27:56.060 --> 00:27:57.060]   I don't know.
[00:27:57.060 --> 00:27:58.060]   I guess that would be the noise canceling.
[00:27:58.060 --> 00:27:59.060]   That's the noise canceling, Mike.
[00:27:59.060 --> 00:28:03.300]   But maybe when you go into video mode, it becomes, I don't know.
[00:28:03.300 --> 00:28:05.940]   This is now a really stretching.
[00:28:05.940 --> 00:28:07.340]   Now we're really stretching.
[00:28:07.340 --> 00:28:11.220]   The IPL touch is even further, what you could do is possibly have the mics changing based
[00:28:11.220 --> 00:28:16.420]   on which direction, which camera it's getting in using the other one as the cancellation.
[00:28:16.420 --> 00:28:17.420]   Yeah.
[00:28:17.420 --> 00:28:19.340]   All right, let's see.
[00:28:19.340 --> 00:28:20.340]   What else?
[00:28:20.340 --> 00:28:23.500]   This is all from nine to five Mac.
[00:28:23.500 --> 00:28:26.500]   Oh, they got more.
[00:28:26.500 --> 00:28:27.500]   There's more.
[00:28:27.500 --> 00:28:30.260]   There's a thing that goes in the middle.
[00:28:30.260 --> 00:28:33.060]   They're saying you to body.
[00:28:33.060 --> 00:28:37.060]   Long rumored smaller.connect your earphone jack move to the bottom.
[00:28:37.060 --> 00:28:38.060]   Ta-da-da.
[00:28:38.060 --> 00:28:41.260]   Photos of the next generation iPhone parts other than the black and white backs.
[00:28:41.260 --> 00:28:44.500]   Photo above is the next generation iPhone frame that holds in components like the home
[00:28:44.500 --> 00:28:47.540]   button, which is definitely present.
[00:28:47.540 --> 00:28:50.860]   In case you heard a rumor that was gone.
[00:28:50.860 --> 00:28:51.860]   They couldn't change that.
[00:28:51.860 --> 00:28:55.220]   According to our supply chain sources, obtain these parts frame indicates new iPhone will
[00:28:55.220 --> 00:28:59.780]   be the same width as the four and four S, but longer.
[00:28:59.780 --> 00:29:03.700]   That's what the rumors seems to, as all seem to agree on.
[00:29:03.700 --> 00:29:05.700]   So it sounds like it's really going to a 16 by nine.
[00:29:05.700 --> 00:29:06.700]   Yeah.
[00:29:06.700 --> 00:29:10.620]   In 16, nine if you turn it sideways.
[00:29:10.620 --> 00:29:18.420]   Screen resolution said to be 1136 by 640 with a screen size of almost exactly four inches
[00:29:18.420 --> 00:29:19.420]   diagonally.
[00:29:19.420 --> 00:29:21.060]   Does that make sense?
[00:29:21.060 --> 00:29:22.700]   Andy do some math for us.
[00:29:22.700 --> 00:29:26.780]   It's way behind the square root of 144 is 12.
[00:29:26.780 --> 00:29:27.780]   Thank you.
[00:29:27.780 --> 00:29:28.780]   Well done.
[00:29:28.780 --> 00:29:36.660]   I guess I could go to the, let me go to the DPI calculator and see what that, uh,
[00:29:36.660 --> 00:29:43.380]   there is a PPI calculator I've used before and see if I can enter in those, those, uh,
[00:29:43.380 --> 00:29:45.380]   numbers and see what we get.
[00:29:45.380 --> 00:29:47.780]   So 1136 by 640.
[00:29:47.780 --> 00:29:52.860]   Is that is, if that is true though, would, would it surprise a little, when you, when
[00:29:52.860 --> 00:29:57.100]   you'd be surprised if they went to the extent, went to the trouble of changing the screen
[00:29:57.100 --> 00:30:01.740]   definition of the, of the iPhone and didn't make it, didn't do it so that they could say,
[00:30:01.740 --> 00:30:06.620]   Oh, by the way, and now this shows H, this shows videos and full HD without any, but
[00:30:06.620 --> 00:30:08.860]   it's seven 20 is okay for a free HD.
[00:30:08.860 --> 00:30:09.860]   But why would they?
[00:30:09.860 --> 00:30:10.860]   Yeah.
[00:30:10.860 --> 00:30:11.860]   What is that?
[00:30:11.860 --> 00:30:15.300]   That's a 325, almost 326 pixels branch.
[00:30:15.300 --> 00:30:16.460]   That's a nice high resolution.
[00:30:16.460 --> 00:30:19.020]   What is the, that's way higher than what they've got right now.
[00:30:19.020 --> 00:30:22.100]   It doesn't sound right, does it?
[00:30:22.100 --> 00:30:26.380]   Could they go super retina?
[00:30:26.380 --> 00:30:28.260]   It's the new super retina display.
[00:30:28.260 --> 00:30:30.220]   I've got lizard retina display.
[00:30:30.220 --> 00:30:39.340]   325, the current iPhone is, uh, let me, let me look it up here.
[00:30:39.340 --> 00:30:40.340]   329.
[00:30:40.340 --> 00:30:43.340]   No, it's pretty close.
[00:30:43.340 --> 00:30:44.740]   That's pretty close.
[00:30:44.740 --> 00:30:50.740]   So it's roughly the same.
[00:30:50.740 --> 00:30:54.740]   According to our sources, glasses room for taller display, same width, blah, blah, blah.
[00:30:54.740 --> 00:30:58.300]   Camera lens for the front, the FaceTime camera has moved above the earpiece.
[00:30:58.300 --> 00:31:01.300]   It is now centered.
[00:31:01.300 --> 00:31:02.940]   Who cares?
[00:31:02.940 --> 00:31:05.180]   Rumored edge to edge technology, not coming in this phone.
[00:31:05.180 --> 00:31:09.940]   If you look on the frame, there is a bezel, not much of a bezel.
[00:31:09.940 --> 00:31:17.220]   And these have micro Sims, not, not the micro Sims from the foreign forests, not the new
[00:31:17.220 --> 00:31:18.860]   micro Sims.
[00:31:18.860 --> 00:31:21.300]   Okay, there you go.
[00:31:21.300 --> 00:31:22.860]   I think these are fairly credible.
[00:31:22.860 --> 00:31:27.300]   When you go, once you get to this point, it's not unusual for parts like these to leak
[00:31:27.300 --> 00:31:28.300]   out.
[00:31:28.300 --> 00:31:30.020]   And then the past 95 said these.
[00:31:30.020 --> 00:31:32.540]   So it's pretty difficult to repel it to build those parts from scratch.
[00:31:32.540 --> 00:31:35.580]   I just want to say those are photos of something.
[00:31:35.580 --> 00:31:36.580]   There's something I guess.
[00:31:36.580 --> 00:31:37.580]   Yeah.
[00:31:37.580 --> 00:31:38.580]   Yeah.
[00:31:38.580 --> 00:31:39.580]   Yeah.
[00:31:39.580 --> 00:31:40.580]   Somebody's, and they don't look photoshopped or anything.
[00:31:40.580 --> 00:31:41.580]   Yeah.
[00:31:41.580 --> 00:31:49.580]   Ah, apples researching stylus concepts with optical tracking and haptic feedback.
[00:31:49.580 --> 00:31:56.140]   This is just a patent, but, uh, but it does seem like it's going to get more and more
[00:31:56.140 --> 00:32:01.620]   important to have some sort of fine grain pressure sensitive style of support at the
[00:32:01.620 --> 00:32:02.620]   system level.
[00:32:02.620 --> 00:32:07.580]   I mean, I don't think it's an accident that they've spent, I think the past couple of
[00:32:07.580 --> 00:32:12.060]   app oriented ads that they've done for the iPad have shown things like really cool drawing
[00:32:12.060 --> 00:32:13.780]   programs for it.
[00:32:13.780 --> 00:32:18.660]   And that's one of the features that every time that there is a pressure, a kickstart
[00:32:18.660 --> 00:32:23.500]   or some sort of a project for pressure sensitive stylus gets lots and lots of attention.
[00:32:23.500 --> 00:32:27.740]   I'd say it's if they are really saying that the iPad is going to be a highly creative
[00:32:27.740 --> 00:32:32.420]   tablet, I think they're going to need to beef up the pen and put a little bit also.
[00:32:32.420 --> 00:32:36.980]   They're going to get some competition next year from, uh, from Windows eight, uh, which,
[00:32:36.980 --> 00:32:41.500]   uh, which already basically says it look, we'll, this is a touch base interface, but
[00:32:41.500 --> 00:32:46.500]   we're just as happy letting you do styluses at the, uh, at the API level as we are letting
[00:32:46.500 --> 00:32:49.220]   you access everything by, by touch.
[00:32:49.220 --> 00:32:54.140]   So I think I really think that there's nothing but upside for Apple to not necessarily package
[00:32:54.140 --> 00:32:59.580]   a stylus with the next generation iPad, but at least to wire it all up so that if somebody
[00:32:59.580 --> 00:33:05.100]   wants to, uh, license that, uh, license that technology to build their own styluses, just
[00:33:05.100 --> 00:33:08.980]   as, just as right now you have to license the dock connector in order to use, uh, to,
[00:33:08.980 --> 00:33:12.740]   to develop compatible hardware, uh, uh, hard work accessories.
[00:33:12.740 --> 00:33:14.460]   I think that's, that's nothing but wind for Apple.
[00:33:14.460 --> 00:33:16.660]   Galaxy note is a pressure sensitive.
[00:33:16.660 --> 00:33:18.100]   It's not the stuff.
[00:33:18.100 --> 00:33:20.820]   So this all, this has something I have not seen before haptic feedback.
[00:33:20.820 --> 00:33:25.340]   So the thing buzzes so you can get vibration from touching stuff.
[00:33:25.340 --> 00:33:30.140]   So that's used, I guess to, you know, help you find edges and like if you're driving,
[00:33:30.140 --> 00:33:31.140]   we see that.
[00:33:31.140 --> 00:33:34.540]   And you, there's a little bit of that when you're using it like a, uh, galaxy to us,
[00:33:34.540 --> 00:33:37.500]   you know, so you're using the, I don't know, do you have that where you're typing and you're
[00:33:37.500 --> 00:33:40.260]   feeling that little bit of a, yeah, they use, they use a little vibration.
[00:33:40.260 --> 00:33:44.780]   I don't think it's really very good, but, uh, I find it kind of kind of useful.
[00:33:44.780 --> 00:33:45.940]   I kind of like it.
[00:33:45.940 --> 00:33:48.940]   I think, I think if it was tuned, it would actually be a great solution.
[00:33:48.940 --> 00:33:50.140]   Apple will do it right.
[00:33:50.140 --> 00:33:51.740]   Anyway, it's just a patent.
[00:33:51.740 --> 00:33:53.340]   I don't usually report on patents.
[00:33:53.340 --> 00:33:55.340]   This comes from unwired view.com.
[00:33:55.340 --> 00:33:59.660]   Uh, and, uh, and this patent is was just published, applied for a couple of years ago,
[00:33:59.660 --> 00:34:06.300]   just published this week, um, for a stylus pressure sensitive.
[00:34:06.300 --> 00:34:12.060]   It looks like more like a tablet might be more for the iPad and, uh, with haptic feedback.
[00:34:12.060 --> 00:34:15.860]   Actually no, that's the iPhone there or something like it.
[00:34:15.860 --> 00:34:20.860]   You could start a new rumor, a fat wide iPhone does have a home button.
[00:34:20.860 --> 00:34:21.860]   I don't know.
[00:34:21.860 --> 00:34:22.860]   Is that a tablet?
[00:34:22.860 --> 00:34:24.860]   Maybe that's the seven inch tablet.
[00:34:24.860 --> 00:34:28.380]   Anyway, moving right along.
[00:34:28.380 --> 00:34:34.060]   Um, as long as we're in the rumors, should we just keep going with rumors?
[00:34:34.060 --> 00:34:35.060]   Sure.
[00:34:35.060 --> 00:34:36.060]   Yeah, it's the rumor mill.
[00:34:36.060 --> 00:34:37.060]   It's the rumor mill episode.
[00:34:37.060 --> 00:34:42.060]   First, it's the first day after all, our first day back after a three day weekend.
[00:34:42.060 --> 00:34:46.700]   I'd much rather be able to say, Oh, that's just a whole lot of balloon juice and then
[00:34:46.700 --> 00:34:51.260]   move on that drink, drink, uh, flip over here in hamburgers that I have to think about.
[00:34:51.260 --> 00:34:56.460]   Well, you know, in an SEC filing data, not just three months ago, Samsung actually did
[00:34:56.460 --> 00:35:00.660]   mention, I do like the tech crunch article by dog, Doc, John Biggs.
[00:35:00.660 --> 00:35:02.620]   I'm sorry, who says think of the docs.
[00:35:02.620 --> 00:35:05.500]   Could the new iPhone have a micro USB connector?
[00:35:05.500 --> 00:35:09.180]   Um, I don't, you know, we're seeing so many pictures and these are all, these are, this
[00:35:09.180 --> 00:35:16.060]   is from another one, you break I fix.com of exactly the same back, exactly the same bottom,
[00:35:16.060 --> 00:35:17.060]   exactly the same.
[00:35:17.060 --> 00:35:20.740]   I have to think this is real unless somebody took all the time to fabricate something like
[00:35:20.740 --> 00:35:22.700]   this and pass it around.
[00:35:22.700 --> 00:35:28.140]   And if they did, all I got to say is well done well and well played.
[00:35:28.140 --> 00:35:30.620]   That's, this is depressing.
[00:35:30.620 --> 00:35:34.500]   If they, I'm not happy if they change the doc connector.
[00:35:34.500 --> 00:35:36.140]   Is it a micro USB port?
[00:35:36.140 --> 00:35:38.980]   Maybe that's remember the, the, it's, it's, it's, it's hard to.
[00:35:38.980 --> 00:35:39.980]   It's hard to tell.
[00:35:39.980 --> 00:35:40.980]   It could be.
[00:35:40.980 --> 00:35:44.220]   Well, and the thing is that that does handle the whole, the whole issue in Europe.
[00:35:44.220 --> 00:35:47.300]   So there's, you know, the, the requirements now in, in many of these countries.
[00:35:47.300 --> 00:35:52.660]   So that would put all of that to rest if, if, uh, Apple just finally just put a, a micro
[00:35:52.660 --> 00:35:53.660]   USB.
[00:35:53.660 --> 00:35:55.500]   The one thing that's interesting though is that Apple has, you know, makes a lot of
[00:35:55.500 --> 00:36:00.340]   money on licensing access to that 30 pin, um, you know, to get full licensing.
[00:36:00.340 --> 00:36:02.980]   So it is an interesting thing that they'd be handing off.
[00:36:02.980 --> 00:36:03.980]   They did that.
[00:36:03.980 --> 00:36:08.940]   Well, that's I guess I could, if it were a micro USB, I could live with that.
[00:36:08.940 --> 00:36:13.380]   Because at least we're moving towards a, a standards based connector.
[00:36:13.380 --> 00:36:14.540]   And, uh, and that would be good.
[00:36:14.540 --> 00:36:15.540]   And you're, and you're right.
[00:36:15.540 --> 00:36:18.700]   It's mandated in Europe that all phones use that, right?
[00:36:18.700 --> 00:36:22.220]   I think right now what, how Apple handles that is some little adapter.
[00:36:22.220 --> 00:36:23.220]   Right.
[00:36:23.220 --> 00:36:27.460]   Uh, and, uh, but it would definitely be cleaner and less more Apple like for it to just work.
[00:36:27.460 --> 00:36:30.220]   So, uh, so I could definitely see the moving that direction.
[00:36:30.220 --> 00:36:34.340]   So something, something that's very non-Apple like is them making a fundamental change to
[00:36:34.340 --> 00:36:39.020]   the hardware to, uh, conform to a regulation that they'd necessarily, that they can fix
[00:36:39.020 --> 00:36:41.420]   by just putting it another three cent part in the box.
[00:36:41.420 --> 00:36:42.420]   True.
[00:36:42.420 --> 00:36:45.900]   Also, also the micro USB doesn't have the signaling, the same signaling that the three
[00:36:45.900 --> 00:36:46.900]   pin connector has.
[00:36:46.900 --> 00:36:51.820]   Uh, so they, a lot of devices like, uh, you know, like, like these video adapters would
[00:36:51.820 --> 00:36:55.340]   probably have to be modified or they'd have to have a, or they'd have to have a separate,
[00:36:55.340 --> 00:36:58.940]   separate adapter for, uh, for that kind of a use or a separate connector, which would
[00:36:58.940 --> 00:36:59.860]   all be the whole purpose.
[00:36:59.860 --> 00:37:04.320]   So I'm going to, I'm going to add up the cost of all the, uh, the, uh, the, uh, the
[00:37:04.320 --> 00:37:07.640]   30 pin connectors I bought over the last five years.
[00:37:07.640 --> 00:37:08.640]   Yeah.
[00:37:08.640 --> 00:37:09.900]   It's going to be thousands of bucks.
[00:37:09.900 --> 00:37:13.400]   I mean, it's ridiculous connectors and docks and I have to replace all of them.
[00:37:13.400 --> 00:37:17.700]   I mean, I will, I will say that I would love for them to switch to some sort of a standard
[00:37:17.700 --> 00:37:23.340]   thing cause I probably now have like two or three, like video connectors because whether
[00:37:23.340 --> 00:37:27.880]   I'm, I mean going into, into Boston for like a short meeting, but I, uh, damn, when I forgot
[00:37:27.880 --> 00:37:32.700]   this one thing, okay, let's go to the Boston street, Apple store and spend $30 on another
[00:37:32.700 --> 00:37:36.080]   connector just because I need to have this for the meeting and I can't go all the way
[00:37:36.080 --> 00:37:37.400]   back home to get it right now.
[00:37:37.400 --> 00:37:42.020]   Uh, it's, and, or rather in another city where I left it behind at the podium, my last
[00:37:42.020 --> 00:37:46.680]   place I was speaking to and you really do value the ability to have just like two or
[00:37:46.680 --> 00:37:52.040]   three of these things in a bag and not have to do life around this one oddball connector
[00:37:52.040 --> 00:37:54.360]   that you must, must, must, must, must keep track of.
[00:37:54.360 --> 00:37:56.100]   Here's the eight pound.
[00:37:56.100 --> 00:38:01.380]   And I mean that in a British pound sterling connector that they sell in the, or I guess
[00:38:01.380 --> 00:38:05.020]   bundle in the countries where it's required a micro USB adapter.
[00:38:05.020 --> 00:38:08.220]   And I, you know, I realize now my Mofi case has a micro USB.
[00:38:08.220 --> 00:38:13.780]   So when I use my Mofi, I sync and charge via the micro USB, which is fine.
[00:38:13.780 --> 00:38:17.120]   I don't know though if it does everything that a micro, that the 30 pin, I'm sure it
[00:38:17.120 --> 00:38:20.860]   doesn't do video and digital and all that stuff, right?
[00:38:20.860 --> 00:38:22.420]   Right.
[00:38:22.420 --> 00:38:26.100]   So here's the question, a good question from the chat room.
[00:38:26.100 --> 00:38:30.180]   Is there enough power to do Thunderbolt on an iPhone?
[00:38:30.180 --> 00:38:33.860]   Wouldn't it be interesting if this were a thunderbolt?
[00:38:33.860 --> 00:38:34.860]   I don't think so.
[00:38:34.860 --> 00:38:35.860]   Like one in the photo though.
[00:38:35.860 --> 00:38:37.900]   No, it's not the right shape.
[00:38:37.900 --> 00:38:41.160]   Also also, that's a really, really thick connector.
[00:38:41.160 --> 00:38:44.380]   So that would really define, that would really limit how, what they could do with the frame
[00:38:44.380 --> 00:38:45.380]   of the case.
[00:38:45.380 --> 00:38:49.260]   They'd have to basically, I think it would occupy the entire iPhone from glass, front
[00:38:49.260 --> 00:38:51.980]   glass to back glass, but it did that way.
[00:38:51.980 --> 00:38:58.900]   Also I'm not, the, the, the, if they, if they are free to do a modified version of the thunderbolt
[00:38:58.900 --> 00:39:02.580]   connector that does not deliver the full amount of power, then they could do it.
[00:39:02.580 --> 00:39:07.180]   I don't believe there's enough power to, they're not going to be able to drive a display off
[00:39:07.180 --> 00:39:11.340]   the iPhone unless they really, really, oh, Xam, sorry.
[00:39:11.340 --> 00:39:13.340]   I'm thinking as I'm answering.
[00:39:13.340 --> 00:39:17.180]   When I, when I looked at the specs for Thunderbolt, the, the, the man said it makes off off of
[00:39:17.180 --> 00:39:20.100]   the CPU are pretty substantial.
[00:39:20.100 --> 00:39:23.580]   And at the time I thought, okay, so I guess that means that you can't, you can't necessarily
[00:39:23.580 --> 00:39:28.660]   do anything smaller than an iPad class machine, because no phone would have the sort of battery
[00:39:28.660 --> 00:39:30.660]   that could really support Thunderbolt again.
[00:39:30.660 --> 00:39:36.980]   But we've seen in the past that Apple has done sort of like a split USB or one USB port
[00:39:36.980 --> 00:39:39.620]   delivers the full power that USB commands.
[00:39:39.620 --> 00:39:43.060]   The other port is not quite enough to charge a full range of devices.
[00:39:43.060 --> 00:39:45.300]   So I don't see that happening.
[00:39:45.300 --> 00:39:47.900]   So fall for the new iPhone.
[00:39:47.900 --> 00:39:50.420]   I'd say so.
[00:39:50.420 --> 00:39:51.940]   And maybe next month.
[00:39:51.940 --> 00:39:52.940]   Yeah.
[00:39:52.940 --> 00:39:59.100]   Next month, maybe for the, for the new Mac books.
[00:39:59.100 --> 00:40:04.620]   And if they, if they do change the display resolution or the change aspect ratio, WWDC
[00:40:04.620 --> 00:40:07.540]   is a place where you would expect them to pop that onto developers.
[00:40:07.540 --> 00:40:10.500]   So you could expect you would, if that's, if that's what they're doing, you wouldn't
[00:40:10.500 --> 00:40:15.500]   be surprised to see them show off the new, the new iPhone in a couple of weeks, but then
[00:40:15.500 --> 00:40:19.100]   maybe necessary, not necessarily ship it until the end of the year.
[00:40:19.100 --> 00:40:20.100]   Yeah.
[00:40:20.100 --> 00:40:21.100]   iOS six.
[00:40:21.100 --> 00:40:22.300]   You, you didn't announce that.
[00:40:22.300 --> 00:40:24.220]   Here's the rumor of the week.
[00:40:24.220 --> 00:40:29.980]   Fox con, according to the boy genius report, reportedly begins taking orders for the Apple
[00:40:29.980 --> 00:40:31.820]   TV.
[00:40:31.820 --> 00:40:36.180]   Apple Chinese manufacturing partner Fox con has reportedly begun accepting orders.
[00:40:36.180 --> 00:40:41.540]   According to an app, build an Apple TV set, according to C not the Chinese news website.
[00:40:41.540 --> 00:40:43.420]   Trial production stage.
[00:40:43.420 --> 00:40:46.940]   This might be one of those that digit digit times are talking about.
[00:40:46.940 --> 00:40:47.940]   Right.
[00:40:47.940 --> 00:40:50.500]   Where they were, where they're playing with it.
[00:40:50.500 --> 00:40:52.500]   I'm thinking a few.
[00:40:52.500 --> 00:40:53.500]   See how it works.
[00:40:53.500 --> 00:40:54.500]   Yeah.
[00:40:54.500 --> 00:40:55.500]   When did you do that at home?
[00:40:55.500 --> 00:40:57.500]   Why would you do that at Fox con?
[00:40:57.500 --> 00:41:00.580]   Well, you have to make sure that the whole, the whole pipeline is going to work.
[00:41:00.580 --> 00:41:01.740]   I mean, it's one thing to do it.
[00:41:01.740 --> 00:41:04.900]   You got to make sure the entire, yeah, the entire piece is going.
[00:41:04.900 --> 00:41:08.140]   So, but that means that's, so you would do that when it's fairly far along.
[00:41:08.140 --> 00:41:11.060]   You've, you've decided on the design, you decide on how it's going to be built, what
[00:41:11.060 --> 00:41:13.300]   it's going to be made of, all of that stuff.
[00:41:13.300 --> 00:41:18.460]   Now you go to your suppliers and say, can you build this, build me some, build me 10.
[00:41:18.460 --> 00:41:20.020]   And how hard is that going to be to build?
[00:41:20.020 --> 00:41:23.140]   What new machines would you may perhaps need us to buy things like that?
[00:41:23.140 --> 00:41:26.460]   Well, I think, I think definitely if you're doing an entirely new pipeline and you're
[00:41:26.460 --> 00:41:30.980]   doing an entirely new setup, you would need to, you have to run that through the entire
[00:41:30.980 --> 00:41:34.060]   system to figure out really how much it's going to cost and whether all the parts are
[00:41:34.060 --> 00:41:37.340]   going to work and whether you can produce a million of these, not just whether you can
[00:41:37.340 --> 00:41:38.340]   produce.
[00:41:38.340 --> 00:41:41.700]   I think we don't usually hear these rumors, but you definitely, anything that you're doing
[00:41:41.700 --> 00:41:46.220]   that needs to be pushed out in mass, you have to do test runs.
[00:41:46.220 --> 00:41:51.140]   And when would you do that, a year, five months, a week, when, before you, before you.
[00:41:51.140 --> 00:41:54.420]   I really think that if we're going to see an Apple TV, we're going to see it somewhere
[00:41:54.420 --> 00:41:59.420]   between October 1st and Thanksgiving, this year, a black, black, right?
[00:41:59.420 --> 00:42:00.420]   Yeah.
[00:42:00.420 --> 00:42:01.420]   Wow.
[00:42:01.420 --> 00:42:03.740]   I think, I think Apple is warming that direction.
[00:42:03.740 --> 00:42:04.740]   Wow.
[00:42:04.740 --> 00:42:05.940]   And my lights all turned off.
[00:42:05.940 --> 00:42:06.940]   I'll be right back.
[00:42:06.940 --> 00:42:07.940]   Actually, wait a minute.
[00:42:07.940 --> 00:42:08.940]   I like that shot.
[00:42:08.940 --> 00:42:09.940]   You like that?
[00:42:09.940 --> 00:42:10.940]   All right.
[00:42:10.940 --> 00:42:11.940]   Go ahead.
[00:42:11.940 --> 00:42:12.940]   Turn on your lights.
[00:42:12.940 --> 00:42:13.940]   All right.
[00:42:13.940 --> 00:42:14.940]   Well, Alex is turning the lights back on.
[00:42:14.940 --> 00:42:20.500]   I'll talk about something quite apropos, the Ford Electric Focus.
[00:42:20.500 --> 00:42:23.940]   The lights never go out on the Ford Focus.
[00:42:23.940 --> 00:42:24.940]   Ford.com/technology.
[00:42:24.940 --> 00:42:26.380]   We've been waiting for this.
[00:42:26.380 --> 00:42:32.260]   We, it was announced at not CES this year, but CES 2011.
[00:42:32.260 --> 00:42:36.500]   And here it is at your Ford, an EV certified Ford dealer near you.
[00:42:36.500 --> 00:42:43.140]   And I'll tell you what, this is a sweet vehicle, the 2012 Ford Focus.
[00:42:43.140 --> 00:42:47.220]   Of course, zero emissions because it's electric.
[00:42:47.220 --> 00:42:52.740]   The best, most fuel efficient five passenger vehicle in America with a city fuel efficiency
[00:42:52.740 --> 00:42:57.860]   rating better than all of 110 MPGE, that's best in its class.
[00:42:57.860 --> 00:43:03.700]   And if you purchase the 240 volt charging station, the best charging time in its class,
[00:43:03.700 --> 00:43:06.900]   three to four hours, that's half the time of the leaf.
[00:43:06.900 --> 00:43:12.140]   Three to four hours charging, you may even be eligible for significant federal tax credit.
[00:43:12.140 --> 00:43:14.780]   This is a really cool vehicle.
[00:43:14.780 --> 00:43:21.540]   Regenerative braking means that 90% of the power energy lost in braking gets preserved
[00:43:21.540 --> 00:43:22.900]   and sent right back to the battery.
[00:43:22.900 --> 00:43:30.020]   That's one of the ways they get a 76 mile range and a sweet looking car.
[00:43:30.020 --> 00:43:31.020]   Look at this.
[00:43:31.020 --> 00:43:34.100]   They've really done a very, very nice job.
[00:43:34.100 --> 00:43:38.980]   The first passenger vehicle from Ford powered by electricity alone and it is here.
[00:43:38.980 --> 00:43:41.740]   Some say why did it take so long for it because they wanted to do it right.
[00:43:41.740 --> 00:43:43.700]   Here's that home charging station.
[00:43:43.700 --> 00:43:45.180]   That's optional, 240 volt.
[00:43:45.180 --> 00:43:46.180]   It's very easy though.
[00:43:46.180 --> 00:43:48.980]   You can plug it into regular 120 AC, it just takes longer to charge.
[00:43:48.980 --> 00:43:54.660]   But with a 240 and it's a simple installation with a 11 and 240 charger, you are going to
[00:43:54.660 --> 00:43:59.540]   be charging in three to four hours, 76 mile range.
[00:43:59.540 --> 00:44:02.580]   This is going to be a practical vehicle.
[00:44:02.580 --> 00:44:05.460]   That's what I love about it.
[00:44:05.460 --> 00:44:07.140]   It never needs an oil change.
[00:44:07.140 --> 00:44:10.980]   Maintenance is very easy on electric vehicles.
[00:44:10.980 --> 00:44:17.220]   And also they have really updated the electronics in the car that my Ford touched, the Ford Sync.
[00:44:17.220 --> 00:44:21.060]   Optimized for electrified driving, vehicle information like fuel level, battery power
[00:44:21.060 --> 00:44:23.660]   level and average in instant miles per gallon.
[00:44:23.660 --> 00:44:30.860]   You can use their smartphone apps, which I love to control charging.
[00:44:30.860 --> 00:44:34.100]   It'll tell you how much is left.
[00:44:34.100 --> 00:44:37.460]   And then they have the my Ford mobile website as well.
[00:44:37.460 --> 00:44:41.020]   This is so cool that you have these capabilities.
[00:44:41.020 --> 00:44:43.460]   These are the charge settings on your smartphone.
[00:44:43.460 --> 00:44:47.140]   This is an Android one, but it also works on the iPhone.
[00:44:47.140 --> 00:44:51.340]   I like the little ring.
[00:44:51.340 --> 00:44:56.820]   With a my Ford mobile app, you can precondition your vehicle temperature before your departure.
[00:44:56.820 --> 00:44:58.900]   That means you warm or chill the vehicle.
[00:44:58.900 --> 00:45:01.980]   Well, really, this is actually something that's different than an electric vehicle.
[00:45:01.980 --> 00:45:04.580]   You don't have all that engine heat to heat the car.
[00:45:04.580 --> 00:45:06.020]   It takes the battery.
[00:45:06.020 --> 00:45:08.660]   So they say, warm up your car before you, well, it's plugged in.
[00:45:08.660 --> 00:45:10.140]   I love that.
[00:45:10.140 --> 00:45:11.140]   This is all in the phone.
[00:45:11.140 --> 00:45:13.460]   This is what this is what it took.
[00:45:13.460 --> 00:45:19.300]   Thinking about thinking hard about what you need in an electric vehicle and making sure
[00:45:19.300 --> 00:45:20.300]   it's there.
[00:45:20.300 --> 00:45:22.060]   I have to say really sweet stuff.
[00:45:22.060 --> 00:45:23.500]   You're going to want to check it out.
[00:45:23.500 --> 00:45:29.380]   Go drive one at an EV certified Ford dealer near you or find out more on the website.
[00:45:29.380 --> 00:45:34.620]   That's where I am right now, Ford.com/technology.
[00:45:34.620 --> 00:45:40.300]   It's a state of the art 23 kilowatt hour lithium ion battery system.
[00:45:40.300 --> 00:45:42.900]   23 kilowatt.
[00:45:42.900 --> 00:45:46.140]   I wish my phone had 23 kilowatt hours.
[00:45:46.140 --> 00:45:48.380]   It'd go all year.
[00:45:48.380 --> 00:45:50.580]   That is so cool.
[00:45:50.580 --> 00:45:56.260]   And next year, look for the 2013 Ford Fusion Energy Plug-in Hybrid.
[00:45:56.260 --> 00:46:00.780]   Thank you, Ford, for making great vehicles and for letting me spend a little time to talk
[00:46:00.780 --> 00:46:02.580]   about them on our show.
[00:46:02.580 --> 00:46:04.220]   Your lights back on, Alex?
[00:46:04.220 --> 00:46:05.220]   They are.
[00:46:05.220 --> 00:46:06.220]   What is it?
[00:46:06.220 --> 00:46:07.220]   The middle of the night there?
[00:46:07.220 --> 00:46:08.220]   What happened?
[00:46:08.220 --> 00:46:12.980]   No, I'm in another part of a room that has an auto energy efficient auto setting where
[00:46:12.980 --> 00:46:15.780]   if no, if it doesn't see anybody moving, it just turns all the lights off and I'm in
[00:46:15.780 --> 00:46:16.780]   a...
[00:46:16.780 --> 00:46:18.860]   You see these black curtains between me and the sensor?
[00:46:18.860 --> 00:46:21.420]   You got to be dancing around a little bit more.
[00:46:21.420 --> 00:46:24.540]   I have to dance all the way around to the other side of the black curtains, which, you
[00:46:24.540 --> 00:46:26.700]   know, then you're hard to hear me.
[00:46:26.700 --> 00:46:30.700]   Apple retail stores will sell the Nest thermostat according to iLounge.
[00:46:30.700 --> 00:46:32.100]   I'm glad to hear that.
[00:46:32.100 --> 00:46:34.820]   Tony Fidella, the guy I designed it, of course, was one of the designers of the original
[00:46:34.820 --> 00:46:35.820]   iPod.
[00:46:35.820 --> 00:46:37.260]   It's a Wi-Fi-enabled thermostat.
[00:46:37.260 --> 00:46:38.580]   We've played with it and love it.
[00:46:38.580 --> 00:46:40.020]   Everybody I know who's used it loves it.
[00:46:40.020 --> 00:46:43.820]   It's just expensive and it's been a little hard to get.
[00:46:43.820 --> 00:46:44.820]   $249.
[00:46:44.820 --> 00:46:47.260]   That's the same price as they're selling it online.
[00:46:47.260 --> 00:46:50.220]   I think the biggest problem there is just filling the channel if they're going to put
[00:46:50.220 --> 00:46:51.220]   it into the Apple store because...
[00:46:51.220 --> 00:46:52.220]   They need to make more, yeah.
[00:46:52.220 --> 00:46:54.820]   That's been the hardest thing is just being able to get one.
[00:46:54.820 --> 00:46:56.300]   Do you have one?
[00:46:56.300 --> 00:46:57.300]   I don't have one.
[00:46:57.300 --> 00:47:00.700]   My back house is kind of, you know, I kind of control it there.
[00:47:00.700 --> 00:47:01.700]   So I don't...
[00:47:01.700 --> 00:47:04.620]   I would really love to get one of those.
[00:47:04.620 --> 00:47:05.620]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:47:05.620 --> 00:47:07.460]   So I've been thinking about getting one for the front house.
[00:47:07.460 --> 00:47:08.460]   It's remarkably simple to...
[00:47:08.460 --> 00:47:11.740]   You think that they're very complicated and they're hooked into something big, but there's
[00:47:11.740 --> 00:47:14.420]   just all they're telling the heater to do is turn on and off.
[00:47:14.420 --> 00:47:18.660]   So taking the one out that you haven't put another one in is not usually that complicated.
[00:47:18.660 --> 00:47:19.660]   Yeah.
[00:47:19.660 --> 00:47:21.620]   I have a friend who bought a bunch of them.
[00:47:21.620 --> 00:47:22.620]   Oh, really?
[00:47:22.620 --> 00:47:23.620]   Yeah.
[00:47:23.620 --> 00:47:25.540]   And he's pretty happy with it.
[00:47:25.540 --> 00:47:29.820]   It does all the things that the demo says it does where it does learn about your movements.
[00:47:29.820 --> 00:47:30.820]   It's easy to set up.
[00:47:30.820 --> 00:47:33.900]   It's easy to modify.
[00:47:33.900 --> 00:47:36.100]   It's cool, which is also really...
[00:47:36.100 --> 00:47:37.100]   Oh, it's super cool.
[00:47:37.100 --> 00:47:38.100]   It's also part of it.
[00:47:38.100 --> 00:47:43.620]   I mean, you'd like to see gadgets that are built more like this thing, where it's a really
[00:47:43.620 --> 00:47:47.460]   nice combination of touch, color, and mechanical interface.
[00:47:47.460 --> 00:47:49.380]   But it surprised me to find out that...
[00:47:49.380 --> 00:47:52.380]   Excuse me, to hear this rumor that it's going to be carried in the Apple Store because
[00:47:52.380 --> 00:47:57.260]   it is really easy to switch out a thermostat, but it still involves remove this thing that's
[00:47:57.260 --> 00:48:01.540]   probably been in this house since the Johnson administration.
[00:48:01.540 --> 00:48:07.980]   Undo some screws, expose a couple of wires, insert these two wires into this new thing,
[00:48:07.980 --> 00:48:11.020]   mount it back into this wall, hoping that it's not...
[00:48:11.020 --> 00:48:15.220]   You didn't rip out the screw heads in the plaster.
[00:48:15.220 --> 00:48:19.500]   It's not a complicated thing to set up, but it's not exactly like plugging in a USB-colored
[00:48:19.500 --> 00:48:20.500]   printer.
[00:48:20.500 --> 00:48:23.580]   Well, I think most people would hire an electrician to do it.
[00:48:23.580 --> 00:48:24.580]   But it's not like it's a major overhaul.
[00:48:24.580 --> 00:48:29.220]   It's not like they have to change their entire heating system to make that work.
[00:48:29.220 --> 00:48:32.540]   It's just an odd consumer device.
[00:48:32.540 --> 00:48:39.980]   I mean, just like the Dyson vacuum is also a really cool, advanced design device.
[00:48:39.980 --> 00:48:42.540]   It's probably the iDevice of vacuum cleaner.
[00:48:42.540 --> 00:48:45.180]   I have one, and I love it, but it's totally overpriced.
[00:48:45.180 --> 00:48:46.180]   It's ridiculous.
[00:48:46.180 --> 00:48:52.220]   But you wonder about, well, what is it about this that says that this is part of the constellation
[00:48:52.220 --> 00:48:55.500]   of Apple products?
[00:48:55.500 --> 00:48:56.900]   They don't all have to be made by Apple.
[00:48:56.900 --> 00:49:01.180]   They don't all have to necessarily dock with an iPad in order to earn their keep.
[00:49:01.180 --> 00:49:04.700]   But it just seems like sort of an odd inclusion inside the Apple store.
[00:49:04.700 --> 00:49:05.700]   I mean, if they're...
[00:49:05.700 --> 00:49:07.020]   Oh, but I think it's so Mac-like, though.
[00:49:07.020 --> 00:49:14.260]   I think it is such a Mac, or not Mac, but I app hardware device where it just works.
[00:49:14.260 --> 00:49:17.860]   The thing is that you pick it up and you play with it and you immediately know what it's
[00:49:17.860 --> 00:49:18.860]   going to do.
[00:49:18.860 --> 00:49:19.860]   And I don't...
[00:49:19.860 --> 00:49:22.100]   It took me like six months to figure out what the Honeywell...
[00:49:22.100 --> 00:49:23.100]   No, that's true.
[00:49:23.100 --> 00:49:24.100]   I have in my house.
[00:49:24.100 --> 00:49:28.140]   My fan goes off every Sunday and Wednesday night and I have no idea why.
[00:49:28.140 --> 00:49:29.140]   Yeah.
[00:49:29.140 --> 00:49:30.140]   Yeah.
[00:49:30.140 --> 00:49:31.220]   I must have pressed a button.
[00:49:31.220 --> 00:49:33.020]   But instead of trying to figure it out, I just...
[00:49:33.020 --> 00:49:36.740]   I know every Wednesday and Sunday night, I've got to go turn the fan off.
[00:49:36.740 --> 00:49:41.780]   But at the same time, like a Windows phone is also very Apple and Mac-like.
[00:49:41.780 --> 00:49:44.140]   Why don't they sell Windows phones and the Apple store them?
[00:49:44.140 --> 00:49:45.620]   Oh, well, wait a minute now.
[00:49:45.620 --> 00:49:47.540]   That's not go crazy.
[00:49:47.540 --> 00:49:50.140]   You can buy the George Foreman grill and like bond you.
[00:49:50.140 --> 00:49:51.140]   It's true.
[00:49:51.140 --> 00:49:52.620]   It is going a little far for the Apple store, isn't it?
[00:49:52.620 --> 00:49:55.420]   I wonder if that's the Tony Fadel connection or...
[00:49:55.420 --> 00:49:56.420]   That's a good point.
[00:49:56.420 --> 00:49:58.860]   Or are you selling the other home improvement items?
[00:49:58.860 --> 00:49:59.860]   Yeah.
[00:49:59.860 --> 00:50:05.340]   Maybe this is the beginning.
[00:50:05.340 --> 00:50:07.340]   Apple stores are selling toilet paper.
[00:50:07.340 --> 00:50:08.340]   I just feel like it does real feel like it.
[00:50:08.340 --> 00:50:09.340]   It does real feel like it does real feel like it does real feel like it does real feel.
[00:50:09.340 --> 00:50:10.340]   Apple approved toilet paper, Apple approved.
[00:50:10.340 --> 00:50:13.340]   Maybe they're going to be expanding your food and apples.
[00:50:13.340 --> 00:50:17.460]   Next to the Apple store, there's going to be sort of a Palm Depot.
[00:50:17.460 --> 00:50:20.620]   It's Home Depot P at part 3 OM.
[00:50:20.620 --> 00:50:24.420]   Okay, well, it was really funny inside my head.
[00:50:24.420 --> 00:50:26.260]   You mean the French word for Apple?
[00:50:26.260 --> 00:50:27.660]   The French word for Apple.
[00:50:27.660 --> 00:50:28.660]   Got it.
[00:50:28.660 --> 00:50:29.860]   I had to think about it.
[00:50:29.860 --> 00:50:31.860]   Palm Depot.
[00:50:31.860 --> 00:50:32.860]   Siri Lite.
[00:50:32.860 --> 00:50:34.780]   One last rumor, then I'll move on.
[00:50:34.780 --> 00:50:43.660]   Siri Lite may surface in Mountain Lion if beta code tidbits are being correctly interpreted.
[00:50:43.660 --> 00:50:48.260]   And Karen Haslam writing in Macworld UK, Siri Lite dictation.
[00:50:48.260 --> 00:50:54.020]   Siri Lite dictation might be a secret feature in the Mountain Lion.
[00:50:54.020 --> 00:50:59.220]   In the new Mountain Lion seed, there's a reference to a key press combination.
[00:50:59.220 --> 00:51:06.500]   Command, Command, that starts dictation.
[00:51:06.500 --> 00:51:07.500]   Command, Command.
[00:51:07.500 --> 00:51:08.500]   Get used to that.
[00:51:08.500 --> 00:51:11.500]   Is there two command buttons on all the Apple keyboards?
[00:51:11.500 --> 00:51:12.500]   Yeah.
[00:51:12.500 --> 00:51:13.500]   Command, Command.
[00:51:13.500 --> 00:51:19.700]   I have to say, now that I'm used to Siri and now I'm used to dictation.
[00:51:19.700 --> 00:51:23.260]   And I had on my new computer, I hadn't reinstalled Dragon.
[00:51:23.260 --> 00:51:25.460]   I just had, you know, just busy and I hadn't put it in.
[00:51:25.460 --> 00:51:29.540]   And I just realized I just couldn't stand the idea of writing anything longer than about,
[00:51:29.540 --> 00:51:31.380]   you know, three lines without dictating it.
[00:51:31.380 --> 00:51:32.380]   So I finally got it back in.
[00:51:32.380 --> 00:51:35.540]   But it was because I was using Siri to do all my text messages and everything else.
[00:51:35.540 --> 00:51:39.220]   I've been doing, on the iPad, I've been doing a lot of email on the iPad using the dictation.
[00:51:39.220 --> 00:51:40.220]   It's really great.
[00:51:40.220 --> 00:51:41.220]   Yeah.
[00:51:41.220 --> 00:51:42.220]   And you get trained.
[00:51:42.220 --> 00:51:44.140]   You get trained exactly.
[00:51:44.140 --> 00:51:48.220]   You learn how to talk and as soon as you do that, you sound a little funny, a little
[00:51:48.220 --> 00:51:49.220]   very, you sound very...
[00:51:49.220 --> 00:51:51.660]   You have to speak very carefully.
[00:51:51.660 --> 00:51:55.300]   And I don't know why, but do you do this when you speak to Siri?
[00:51:55.300 --> 00:51:57.700]   Do you add inflection?
[00:51:57.700 --> 00:51:59.420]   I sometimes do.
[00:51:59.420 --> 00:52:03.620]   Often times when I'm speaking for dictation, I sound like this period.
[00:52:03.620 --> 00:52:05.060]   Sometimes I sound monotonic.
[00:52:05.060 --> 00:52:06.060]   Yes.
[00:52:06.060 --> 00:52:10.340]   But then, but then I notice sometimes I'll be dictating texts on Siri and I'll add the
[00:52:10.340 --> 00:52:11.340]   emphasis.
[00:52:11.340 --> 00:52:13.380]   You know, I'll get, I'll get all head up.
[00:52:13.380 --> 00:52:19.860]   I say, no, I am absolutely not going to be able to do that period.
[00:52:19.860 --> 00:52:23.220]   Exclamation mark, new paragraph.
[00:52:23.220 --> 00:52:25.260]   And it's a very strange experience.
[00:52:25.260 --> 00:52:29.700]   Often times I think to myself, open quote.
[00:52:29.700 --> 00:52:31.660]   What am I doing here?
[00:52:31.660 --> 00:52:34.420]   Close quote period.
[00:52:34.420 --> 00:52:36.780]   I think we're seeing like a change in the generations.
[00:52:36.780 --> 00:52:42.580]   Like when I think all of us were growing up, you knew that mom was really mad at you when
[00:52:42.580 --> 00:52:44.980]   she addressed you and used your middle name.
[00:52:44.980 --> 00:52:45.980]   Yes.
[00:52:45.980 --> 00:52:49.420]   Now, a person, oh my God, she's using her Siri voice with me.
[00:52:49.420 --> 00:52:51.780]   She really wants me to do this exactly.
[00:52:51.780 --> 00:52:53.900]   She's not going to stand for anything from me.
[00:52:53.900 --> 00:52:54.900]   I am sorry.
[00:52:54.900 --> 00:52:55.900]   Andy.
[00:52:55.900 --> 00:52:56.900]   Andy.
[00:52:56.900 --> 00:52:57.900]   Upstairs.
[00:52:57.900 --> 00:52:58.900]   No, upstairs.
[00:52:58.900 --> 00:52:59.900]   Do not cush.
[00:52:59.900 --> 00:53:01.900]   Or deep with a toothbrush.
[00:53:01.900 --> 00:53:04.460]   Then go straight to bed period.
[00:53:04.460 --> 00:53:05.460]   Have you seen...
[00:53:05.460 --> 00:53:09.900]   I almost want to call him Sir John Malkovich.
[00:53:09.900 --> 00:53:10.900]   He's not a Sir.
[00:53:10.900 --> 00:53:14.900]   Have you seen the new John Malkovich, Apple ad's let's play.
[00:53:14.900 --> 00:53:20.740]   I think I can play these without getting pulled from YouTube.
[00:53:20.740 --> 00:53:21.740]   Weather.
[00:53:21.740 --> 00:53:25.020]   Nice weather coming up today through this Tuesday.
[00:53:25.020 --> 00:53:26.420]   Evening.
[00:53:26.420 --> 00:53:29.340]   You don't have anything on your calendar for this evening.
[00:53:29.340 --> 00:53:30.340]   Fantastic.
[00:53:30.340 --> 00:53:31.340]   Linguiso.
[00:53:31.340 --> 00:53:36.860]   I found five restaurants whose reviews mention Linguiso fairly close to you.
[00:53:36.860 --> 00:53:37.860]   Joke.
[00:53:37.860 --> 00:53:40.420]   Two iPhones walk into a bar.
[00:53:40.420 --> 00:53:43.620]   I forget the rest.
[00:53:43.620 --> 00:53:44.620]   That's funny.
[00:53:44.620 --> 00:53:46.500]   Was it something I said?
[00:53:46.500 --> 00:53:48.660]   Yes, it was.
[00:53:48.660 --> 00:53:50.900]   I can't wait for the Christopher Walken.
[00:53:50.900 --> 00:53:52.820]   iPhone ads.
[00:53:52.820 --> 00:53:59.380]   Just Siri, just the other day, I was driving along and I saw a possum by the side of the
[00:53:59.380 --> 00:54:00.380]   road.
[00:54:00.380 --> 00:54:05.460]   Its brains were smashed all over the blacktop and its fur reminded me of a coat that my
[00:54:05.460 --> 00:54:09.460]   dad used to wear on cold nights when he would leave us.
[00:54:09.460 --> 00:54:13.100]   You're freaking me out.
[00:54:13.100 --> 00:54:14.620]   I think it's only a matter of time.
[00:54:14.620 --> 00:54:18.260]   I mean, they've had Zoe Deschanel.
[00:54:18.260 --> 00:54:19.820]   We talked about that.
[00:54:19.820 --> 00:54:22.180]   There were some Samuel Jackson ones right?
[00:54:22.180 --> 00:54:24.180]   And then that's not weird.
[00:54:24.180 --> 00:54:26.500]   Aren't they celebrity ads like really weird?
[00:54:26.500 --> 00:54:30.740]   Because the focus isn't really not isn't so much on the technology so much as, hey, cool.
[00:54:30.740 --> 00:54:31.740]   That's Samuel Jackson.
[00:54:31.740 --> 00:54:36.900]   He's talking to Siri as though like he's going to be putting the moves on Siri later on.
[00:54:36.900 --> 00:54:40.740]   As opposed to great technology, useful, practical and stylish.
[00:54:40.740 --> 00:54:42.220]   All at an affordable price.
[00:54:42.220 --> 00:54:43.220]   The iPhone 4S.
[00:54:43.220 --> 00:54:46.140]   Go to your local Apple store.
[00:54:46.140 --> 00:54:47.740]   I won't play.
[00:54:47.740 --> 00:54:49.140]   There are a lot of parody ones.
[00:54:49.140 --> 00:54:50.140]   I can't play this one.
[00:54:50.140 --> 00:54:53.500]   This is Chris Brown and Siri.
[00:54:53.500 --> 00:54:54.940]   She gets upset with him.
[00:54:54.940 --> 00:54:57.540]   She kind of starts swearing at him.
[00:54:57.540 --> 00:55:01.260]   Then Joey Deschanel.
[00:55:01.260 --> 00:55:05.700]   We played, I think we played it, I don't know if it was last week or on Twitter, the fake
[00:55:05.700 --> 00:55:07.980]   Zoe Deschanel, which it was very funny.
[00:55:07.980 --> 00:55:09.580]   Aussie, you want to do a Siri ad?
[00:55:09.580 --> 00:55:12.700]   I think my dog wants to do a Siri ad as well.
[00:55:12.700 --> 00:55:15.140]   I want them to put dictation into the Mac.
[00:55:15.140 --> 00:55:21.020]   I admit that it's going to be a problem in an office, in a library, in school, there are
[00:55:21.020 --> 00:55:22.540]   places you won't want to use it.
[00:55:22.540 --> 00:55:24.900]   But at home when it's quiet, I like to talk.
[00:55:24.900 --> 00:55:27.740]   I just talk to my computer.
[00:55:27.740 --> 00:55:30.260]   It's so much faster and so much more.
[00:55:30.260 --> 00:55:35.060]   When you get used to it, the ability to put out an enormous amount of information onto
[00:55:35.060 --> 00:55:38.180]   a page is pretty amazing.
[00:55:38.180 --> 00:55:40.820]   What I do find interesting though is I don't know, Andy, I don't know if you've done a
[00:55:40.820 --> 00:55:45.660]   lot of dictation, but my writing voice is very different when I dictate than when I type.
[00:55:45.660 --> 00:55:46.660]   That's interesting.
[00:55:46.660 --> 00:55:47.660]   Is it more like you?
[00:55:47.660 --> 00:55:49.660]   Well, that's definitely natural.
[00:55:49.660 --> 00:55:54.100]   When I type it, when I type it, I'm much more sarcastic.
[00:55:54.100 --> 00:55:57.980]   Much more sarcastic and edgy and I don't know.
[00:55:57.980 --> 00:56:03.820]   I'm much less that way when I'm more verbose, obviously, when I'm speaking.
[00:56:03.820 --> 00:56:04.820]   Who's our vote?
[00:56:04.820 --> 00:56:05.820]   Go ahead, Andy.
[00:56:05.820 --> 00:56:06.820]   You were going to say something.
[00:56:06.820 --> 00:56:11.340]   I was just going to say that's a standard writing technique where if you're worried
[00:56:11.340 --> 00:56:15.620]   about the meter, the rhythm, or the clarity of what you're writing, you should really
[00:56:15.620 --> 00:56:17.260]   just speak your text aloud.
[00:56:17.260 --> 00:56:21.740]   At the point where you actually can't find, you can't even speak this entire sentence
[00:56:21.740 --> 00:56:22.740]   in one breath.
[00:56:22.740 --> 00:56:26.380]   You realize that that's a place you want to cut.
[00:56:26.380 --> 00:56:27.860]   We have to agree with disagree.
[00:56:27.860 --> 00:56:34.540]   I've tried to use dictation both in rare times when I've done something stupid.
[00:56:34.540 --> 00:56:39.220]   Forget that I'm in my 40s and not 17 years old and done something with a hockey stick
[00:56:39.220 --> 00:56:44.780]   in my hand that someone in their 40s should not be doing and decide, okay, I guess I'm
[00:56:44.780 --> 00:56:48.740]   going to rest my hands for a couple of days here and try to do dictation.
[00:56:48.740 --> 00:56:55.060]   It's just so frustrating to have to like, it might just be the way my brain is wired
[00:56:55.060 --> 00:56:56.060]   up.
[00:56:56.060 --> 00:57:02.380]   It's not wired up to take thoughts from my brain, translate them into text and then say
[00:57:02.380 --> 00:57:04.380]   them.
[00:57:04.380 --> 00:57:08.580]   It really is set up to do this and read the words as they appear and then judge them as
[00:57:08.580 --> 00:57:10.900]   they're appearing magically on the screen.
[00:57:10.900 --> 00:57:14.820]   Also, just editing is just a big problem.
[00:57:14.820 --> 00:57:20.020]   I do like the fact that when I get a sore throat the longer I write that does tend to
[00:57:20.020 --> 00:57:25.940]   get me to make that 4,000 word column like an 800 word column instead, but it's no way
[00:57:25.940 --> 00:57:26.940]   to live, man.
[00:57:26.940 --> 00:57:27.940]   It's just no way to live.
[00:57:27.940 --> 00:57:31.020]   Well, I wouldn't write a long column, but I do like a little dictation.
[00:57:31.020 --> 00:57:35.420]   But if you don't want to use it, you have a keyboard and I think that that's what we
[00:57:35.420 --> 00:57:36.420]   could keep our placement.
[00:57:36.420 --> 00:57:40.020]   What we would get upset about is if they take the keyboard out and then you could say reasonably.
[00:57:40.020 --> 00:57:41.020]   I will not.
[00:57:41.020 --> 00:57:48.540]   I was going to say, they pulled away the crowed dip pen and I said nothing because I used
[00:57:48.540 --> 00:57:49.540]   a ballpoint.
[00:57:49.540 --> 00:57:50.700]   Then they took away the ballpoint.
[00:57:50.700 --> 00:57:52.740]   I said nothing because I used a keyboard.
[00:57:52.740 --> 00:57:56.660]   Then they took away my keyboard and there was nobody to speak for.
[00:57:56.660 --> 00:57:59.820]   Everyone who was speaking was actually just dictating text and couldn't be bothered to
[00:57:59.820 --> 00:58:00.820]   save me.
[00:58:00.820 --> 00:58:06.220]   Now, the chair has been having fun guessing who the next Siri celebrity ad will be by.
[00:58:06.220 --> 00:58:07.340]   One is by William Shatner.
[00:58:07.340 --> 00:58:08.820]   I think that'd be good.
[00:58:08.820 --> 00:58:12.220]   And that would be fun.
[00:58:12.220 --> 00:58:14.380]   Patrick Stewart, make it so Siri.
[00:58:14.380 --> 00:58:15.380]   That'd be good.
[00:58:15.380 --> 00:58:16.380]   I know who the next one is.
[00:58:16.380 --> 00:58:18.740]   Johnny Depp as Captain Jack Sparrow.
[00:58:18.740 --> 00:58:24.700]   Siri, what will it be, Alex?
[00:58:24.700 --> 00:58:27.220]   I think it's Kurt D'Olya.
[00:58:27.220 --> 00:58:28.220]   Who's that?
[00:58:28.220 --> 00:58:29.220]   He's the computer.
[00:58:29.220 --> 00:58:31.540]   Oh, open the pod bay doors.
[00:58:31.540 --> 00:58:32.980]   Oh, oh, here to lay.
[00:58:32.980 --> 00:58:33.980]   Yeah, Siri.
[00:58:33.980 --> 00:58:34.980]   Sorry.
[00:58:34.980 --> 00:58:40.900]   If they were like an office pool on this, I would put in my $10 and written on that $10
[00:58:40.900 --> 00:58:43.100]   bill would be the name Jim Parsons.
[00:58:43.100 --> 00:58:44.100]   Who's that?
[00:58:44.100 --> 00:58:45.100]   He's the...
[00:58:45.100 --> 00:58:46.100]   Sheldon?
[00:58:46.100 --> 00:58:48.900]   He's Sheldon from the Big Bang Theory.
[00:58:48.900 --> 00:58:49.900]   I could just...
[00:58:49.900 --> 00:58:50.900]   Siri?
[00:58:50.900 --> 00:58:51.900]   I could just...
[00:58:51.900 --> 00:58:52.900]   Siri?
[00:58:52.900 --> 00:58:53.900]   Right?
[00:58:53.900 --> 00:58:54.900]   Right?
[00:58:54.900 --> 00:58:56.740]   I think a 30-second scene in which he's being a little bit like himself, a little bit like
[00:58:56.740 --> 00:59:00.660]   Sheldon having a conversation and being very, very comfortable having a conversation with
[00:59:00.660 --> 00:59:02.500]   the phone.
[00:59:02.500 --> 00:59:03.500]   That would be my...
[00:59:03.500 --> 00:59:04.500]   Jack Baldwin.
[00:59:04.500 --> 00:59:05.580]   I think Alex had been doing a lot of ads lately.
[00:59:05.580 --> 00:59:08.260]   I could see him doing it absolutely.
[00:59:08.260 --> 00:59:09.260]   Absolutely.
[00:59:09.260 --> 00:59:10.260]   It'd be very funny.
[00:59:10.260 --> 00:59:12.660]   Anthony Hopkins has Hannibal Lecter.
[00:59:12.660 --> 00:59:13.660]   Mmm.
[00:59:13.660 --> 00:59:16.620]   Let's see.
[00:59:16.620 --> 00:59:18.140]   There's a lot of good choices out there.
[00:59:18.140 --> 00:59:19.140]   Gary Bussy.
[00:59:19.140 --> 00:59:20.140]   Brian Blessed.
[00:59:20.140 --> 00:59:21.140]   Woody Allen.
[00:59:21.140 --> 00:59:22.140]   Sam and me.
[00:59:22.140 --> 00:59:25.660]   I'm like the burrito now.
[00:59:25.660 --> 00:59:28.020]   I'm going to have to get Kevin Pollock on the show.
[00:59:28.020 --> 00:59:30.660]   He can just do impressions of Siri ads.
[00:59:30.660 --> 00:59:32.380]   President Obama, I don't think is available.
[00:59:32.380 --> 00:59:34.380]   Little Bird Confreet Leonard Nimoy.
[00:59:34.380 --> 00:59:35.380]   Jim Carrey.
[00:59:35.380 --> 00:59:36.380]   You all be...
[00:59:36.380 --> 00:59:40.500]   Obviously, Apple has a long ad campaign in front of them.
[00:59:40.500 --> 00:59:41.860]   I think that that's...
[00:59:41.860 --> 00:59:42.860]   Yeah.
[00:59:42.860 --> 00:59:44.860]   Robert and Williams would be fun, wouldn't he?
[00:59:44.860 --> 00:59:46.500]   You know, you wouldn't even have to script that one.
[00:59:46.500 --> 00:59:50.900]   I mean, if you've ever been around Rob Williams, I would just hand him the phone and let him
[00:59:50.900 --> 00:59:53.300]   do whatever he's going to do and it'll be great.
[00:59:53.300 --> 00:59:54.300]   You'd have four hours.
[00:59:54.300 --> 00:59:55.940]   He'd cut down to 30 good seconds.
[00:59:55.940 --> 00:59:56.940]   Yep.
[00:59:56.940 --> 00:59:57.940]   Exactly.
[00:59:57.940 --> 00:59:58.940]   George DeK.
[00:59:58.940 --> 01:00:00.260]   I think we got some good Lewis Black.
[01:00:00.260 --> 01:00:01.260]   Sean Connery.
[01:00:01.260 --> 01:00:02.260]   Oh, sure.
[01:00:02.260 --> 01:00:04.700]   I think there'd be a big sherry.
[01:00:04.700 --> 01:00:06.180]   One thing over there.
[01:00:06.180 --> 01:00:07.820]   Paul Lind, if you were alive.
[01:00:07.820 --> 01:00:09.180]   Well, anyway, we've got some good choices.
[01:00:09.180 --> 01:00:11.660]   I hope Apple's been in attention.
[01:00:11.660 --> 01:00:14.740]   Siri has been banned at the IBM headquarters, by the way.
[01:00:14.740 --> 01:00:18.540]   IBM, now this is the strangest decision.
[01:00:18.540 --> 01:00:23.140]   IBM says, "Well, we found out that everything you say to Siri goes to the North Carolina
[01:00:23.140 --> 01:00:26.100]   Data Center and we don't want...
[01:00:26.100 --> 01:00:27.620]   We think that's a security flaw.
[01:00:27.620 --> 01:00:30.580]   So we're going to ban the use of Siri on our network.
[01:00:30.580 --> 01:00:31.580]   I guess they just block...
[01:00:31.580 --> 01:00:32.900]   I don't know how they do it.
[01:00:32.900 --> 01:00:35.300]   They block Siri."
[01:00:35.300 --> 01:00:36.900]   That's just like...
[01:00:36.900 --> 01:00:38.540]   Don't use Google either because guess what?
[01:00:38.540 --> 01:00:40.060]   It's all going to Google too.
[01:00:40.060 --> 01:00:45.500]   In fact, maybe you should just turn off that pesky internet IBM.
[01:00:45.500 --> 01:00:50.700]   That's a security problem.
[01:00:50.700 --> 01:00:51.700]   Apple and Samsung...
[01:00:51.700 --> 01:00:57.740]   Remember the Samsung CEO came to San Francisco for settlement talks with Tim Cook.
[01:00:57.740 --> 01:01:00.020]   Nothing came of it.
[01:01:00.020 --> 01:01:04.700]   They failed to agree on a settlement that would have ended the company's year-long patent
[01:01:04.700 --> 01:01:05.860]   fight.
[01:01:05.860 --> 01:01:12.060]   The legal team's been in San Francisco courtroom for nine hours last week, seven hours.
[01:01:12.060 --> 01:01:15.340]   I feel like that was just a requirement that Apple had to make sure that they were acting
[01:01:15.340 --> 01:01:16.780]   in quote-unquote "good faith."
[01:01:16.780 --> 01:01:19.580]   I bet they sat there for nine hours like this.
[01:01:19.580 --> 01:01:20.580]   Yeah.
[01:01:20.580 --> 01:01:22.340]   Arms folded.
[01:01:22.340 --> 01:01:26.380]   Did everything they could not to say?
[01:01:26.380 --> 01:01:30.220]   You're going to squash you.
[01:01:30.220 --> 01:01:36.940]   A Samsung spokesman said the company is quote "unable to provide any details of the meeting."
[01:01:36.940 --> 01:01:38.900]   Apple did not respond to comment.
[01:01:38.900 --> 01:01:44.340]   Highlighting a lack of agreement Wednesday, shortly after those 16 hours of meetings, Samsung
[01:01:44.340 --> 01:01:50.460]   filed a brief accusing Apple of concealing evidence saying Apple withheld 283 relevant
[01:01:50.460 --> 01:01:57.940]   deposition transcripts totaling more than 34,000 pages of testimony throughout the discovery
[01:01:57.940 --> 01:02:01.940]   period and for six weeks thereafter preventing Samsung from using these materials.
[01:02:01.940 --> 01:02:05.340]   Boy, it's just ugly.
[01:02:05.340 --> 01:02:06.340]   It does.
[01:02:06.340 --> 01:02:08.700]   It's just ugly.
[01:02:08.700 --> 01:02:13.500]   By the way, March and March Apple accused Samsung of doing the same thing.
[01:02:13.500 --> 01:02:18.780]   Really, from a revenue perspective, I think they're actually very close in size, aren't
[01:02:18.780 --> 01:02:19.780]   they?
[01:02:19.780 --> 01:02:20.780]   That's interesting.
[01:02:20.780 --> 01:02:25.500]   Well, an Apple uses Samsung as a big supplier for a lot of the parts that Apple uses.
[01:02:25.500 --> 01:02:26.500]   Right.
[01:02:26.500 --> 01:02:27.860]   But it's not a David and Goliath kind of thing here.
[01:02:27.860 --> 01:02:28.860]   Oh, no.
[01:02:28.860 --> 01:02:30.140]   Samsung can stand up to Apple.
[01:02:30.140 --> 01:02:31.140]   Absolutely.
[01:02:31.140 --> 01:02:32.140]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:02:32.140 --> 01:02:33.660]   I mean, this is not had Apple paying on some little company there.
[01:02:33.660 --> 01:02:34.660]   It doesn't look to be.
[01:02:34.660 --> 01:02:35.660]   It's a bit toe to toe.
[01:02:35.660 --> 01:02:38.620]   Maybe it's just me, but I think it looks kind of cheerlish on the part of Apple.
[01:02:38.620 --> 01:02:42.980]   I understand that they believe that they were infringed upon and so they have a right
[01:02:42.980 --> 01:02:44.220]   to pursue that.
[01:02:44.220 --> 01:02:52.420]   But as Samsung rapidly becomes the biggest number two cell phone company, the Galaxy
[01:02:52.420 --> 01:02:58.380]   S3 9 million pre-orders that came out today, I think, in the UK.
[01:02:58.380 --> 01:03:00.420]   I'm sorry you should be there.
[01:03:00.420 --> 01:03:01.900]   We have a business in the UK.
[01:03:01.900 --> 01:03:02.900]   I ordered mine.
[01:03:02.900 --> 01:03:03.900]   It should come any day now.
[01:03:03.900 --> 01:03:07.300]   And then January or June 20th, I'm sorry, in the US.
[01:03:07.300 --> 01:03:10.580]   This is a very hot phone right now.
[01:03:10.580 --> 01:03:13.060]   I think they're scared.
[01:03:13.060 --> 01:03:15.780]   I think it looks like they're scared.
[01:03:15.780 --> 01:03:21.380]   Well I think that with any of these, not only is there an option handling the current case,
[01:03:21.380 --> 01:03:26.380]   but it's also a message to a lot of other folks that we're not going to, Samsung may
[01:03:26.380 --> 01:03:28.820]   have a lot of money, but you may not.
[01:03:28.820 --> 01:03:30.860]   Right, so don't mess with us.
[01:03:30.860 --> 01:03:43.020]   I mean, this is a message, this is that moment from when Gene Hackman is beating up in the
[01:03:43.020 --> 01:03:44.020]   room, unforgiven.
[01:03:44.020 --> 01:03:48.780]   When he's beating up, I'm not hitting you, you know, Bob.
[01:03:48.780 --> 01:03:53.620]   I'm kicking all these guys in Montana and Kansas and everything else, you know, to remind
[01:03:53.620 --> 01:03:55.700]   them that this is not a place to do this.
[01:03:55.700 --> 01:03:58.060]   I think that's also part of the message, I think.
[01:03:58.060 --> 01:04:05.620]   The jailbreak for iOS 5.1.1, the most recent version of iOS, absence 2.0 has been downloaded.
[01:04:05.620 --> 01:04:14.300]   It was downloaded this weekend almost 1 million times, 973,086 devices have been jailbroken
[01:04:14.300 --> 01:04:23.420]   as of Sunday evening of that 211,000 about a quarter where Apple's newest iPad program
[01:04:23.420 --> 01:04:28.420]   came out on Friday, runs to a computer connected to an iOS device, and works with the iPhone
[01:04:28.420 --> 01:04:29.660]   as well as the iPad.
[01:04:29.660 --> 01:04:32.340]   That's a lot of jailbreak.
[01:04:32.340 --> 01:04:35.580]   Do you guys believe in jailbreak?
[01:04:35.580 --> 01:04:36.580]   It's completely legal.
[01:04:36.580 --> 01:04:38.740]   There's too much trouble for me.
[01:04:38.740 --> 01:04:39.740]   Yeah.
[01:04:39.740 --> 01:04:40.740]   Not so much anymore.
[01:04:40.740 --> 01:04:41.740]   Yeah.
[01:04:41.740 --> 01:04:43.980]   I mean, all you get is third party apps, right?
[01:04:43.980 --> 01:04:45.980]   I mean, that's basically what you're doing.
[01:04:45.980 --> 01:04:49.740]   Third party apps, it's great if you like to tweak because if you go to city and look
[01:04:49.740 --> 01:04:56.020]   at the repository, you see a lot of really cool innovations on changes to the lock screen.
[01:04:56.020 --> 01:05:00.420]   Shortcuts for hardware features like turning, finally turning Bluetooth on and off just
[01:05:00.420 --> 01:05:07.660]   with a one button tap in order to get things done, multi touch gestures for doing operating
[01:05:07.660 --> 01:05:08.660]   system level things.
[01:05:08.660 --> 01:05:11.140]   But you really have to love those sort of things.
[01:05:11.140 --> 01:05:15.820]   You really have to believe that the stock iOS is really fundamentally broken to make
[01:05:15.820 --> 01:05:21.060]   it worth your while because remember that when you jailbreak your phone, you are, by
[01:05:21.060 --> 01:05:26.500]   definition, you're exploiting a security vulnerability and you're usually adding a new
[01:05:26.500 --> 01:05:29.900]   vulnerability if you don't do it correctly.
[01:05:29.900 --> 01:05:31.900]   I should clarify.
[01:05:31.900 --> 01:05:34.620]   I haven't checked out this latest one.
[01:05:34.620 --> 01:05:38.020]   I haven't actually jailbroken your device in about six months.
[01:05:38.020 --> 01:05:40.180]   But there's always like a long list of things now.
[01:05:40.180 --> 01:05:45.060]   After you've opened the store, make sure you shut it, make sure you, you, you, that
[01:05:45.060 --> 01:05:46.220]   other things.
[01:05:46.220 --> 01:05:47.420]   But it's just not worth it.
[01:05:47.420 --> 01:05:51.940]   It's not like Android, like a rum flashing, rum hacking, where you can say everything that
[01:05:51.940 --> 01:05:56.700]   you don't like about this, about the, the, the ROMs that HTC or that T-Mobile put into
[01:05:56.700 --> 01:06:01.540]   this thing, you can actually get rid of the skin that they put onto Android, replace it
[01:06:01.540 --> 01:06:07.740]   with a stock Android or a, a replace with a new really cool modded ROM set that makes
[01:06:07.740 --> 01:06:10.460]   it look as slick as an iPhone does.
[01:06:10.460 --> 01:06:15.420]   So there's, there just isn't that same sort of, of attraction on iOS, at least not for
[01:06:15.420 --> 01:06:23.460]   me.
[01:06:23.460 --> 01:06:24.460]   Moving along.
[01:06:24.460 --> 01:06:28.780]   I'm looking at the boy genius report here.
[01:06:28.780 --> 01:06:31.740]   I have another article.
[01:06:31.740 --> 01:06:34.380]   Unfortunately, it's on Yahoo.
[01:06:34.380 --> 01:06:39.380]   I like to, I like to show the, the original on the boy genius instead of just the Yahoo
[01:06:39.380 --> 01:06:40.380]   repeat.
[01:06:40.380 --> 01:06:46.540]   Isn't that a little bit annoying where you get to, you, you discover an article that's
[01:06:46.540 --> 01:06:50.940]   really, really interesting and you actually have to click on four different links before
[01:06:50.940 --> 01:06:51.940]   you get to original.
[01:06:51.940 --> 01:06:56.220]   But the person, the person who actually broke the story and did the research and that was
[01:06:56.220 --> 01:07:00.340]   picked up by website B who essentially paraphrased the whole thing and just said, oh, well, by
[01:07:00.340 --> 01:07:02.260]   the way, here's a tiny little link.
[01:07:02.260 --> 01:07:03.580]   And who wasn't caught?
[01:07:03.580 --> 01:07:09.140]   I think it was Adam Curry who called the Huffington Post, Henrianna Huffington's little, little
[01:07:09.140 --> 01:07:11.740]   AOL Xerox machine.
[01:07:11.740 --> 01:07:12.740]   It is a shame.
[01:07:12.740 --> 01:07:16.260]   This is from Yahoo, but really originally from the boy genius report, Zach Epstein, after
[01:07:16.260 --> 01:07:24.980]   two months usage of the iPad, third generation has passed the original iPad model.
[01:07:24.980 --> 01:07:31.700]   Software analytics firm, localetics says that the latest iPad is now 14% of the US iPad
[01:07:31.700 --> 01:07:32.700]   market.
[01:07:32.700 --> 01:07:38.020]   That happened just four days because of the three million device debut.
[01:07:38.020 --> 01:07:44.140]   And now a week and two months after the third iPad launched, the new model share of US usage
[01:07:44.140 --> 01:07:49.300]   was 20%, surpassing the original model for the first time.
[01:07:49.300 --> 01:07:52.100]   So a big success for the new iPad, not surprising.
[01:07:52.100 --> 01:07:54.700]   No, that was that.
[01:07:54.700 --> 01:07:58.940]   It was just too much, too much, too much better over the iPad two.
[01:07:58.940 --> 01:08:01.020]   The iPad two was sort of an incremental thing.
[01:08:01.020 --> 01:08:05.020]   I think that that was, I think the iPad, the third, the new iPad represented a lot of pent
[01:08:05.020 --> 01:08:09.540]   up demand, both people who were happy with the iPad one, but weren't happy enough with
[01:08:09.540 --> 01:08:11.780]   the iPad two to make that upgrade.
[01:08:11.780 --> 01:08:15.900]   And people who have been sort of thinking about an iPad for the past couple of years, but have
[01:08:15.900 --> 01:08:17.820]   never really pulled the chain.
[01:08:17.820 --> 01:08:20.340]   But now the iPad three is just two compelling device.
[01:08:20.340 --> 01:08:25.180]   So it was 20, 20% the first iPad, 20% the second iPad.
[01:08:25.180 --> 01:08:30.180]   That means 60% iPad two of all iPad usage.
[01:08:30.180 --> 01:08:31.460]   And I presume they mean online.
[01:08:31.460 --> 01:08:34.820]   I don't know how else they could figure that out.
[01:08:34.820 --> 01:08:40.580]   I wonder if it's a bandwidth or hits because the iPad, because if it's by bandwidth, you
[01:08:40.580 --> 01:08:47.100]   know, the iPad, the new iPad would be possibly sucking up a lot more because of the resolution
[01:08:47.100 --> 01:08:48.100]   and so on.
[01:08:48.100 --> 01:08:49.100]   Right.
[01:08:49.100 --> 01:08:50.100]   Right.
[01:08:50.100 --> 01:08:51.100]   By the way, good news.
[01:08:51.100 --> 01:08:58.500]   The TSA is spending $3 million on Max and other Apple gear.
[01:08:58.500 --> 01:09:00.020]   We're just tired of these PCs.
[01:09:00.020 --> 01:09:02.020]   We want more Max.
[01:09:02.020 --> 01:09:05.420]   It's the latest hopefully it'll get faster.
[01:09:05.420 --> 01:09:09.300]   They're actually moving away from blackberries and Windows PCs.
[01:09:09.300 --> 01:09:11.820]   It's a pilot program and we're running over the next three years.
[01:09:11.820 --> 01:09:18.980]   They will buy Max iPhones, iPads and even Apple TVs because after a hard day searching
[01:09:18.980 --> 01:09:26.060]   malefactors at the airport, you need to relax and watch some Apple TV.
[01:09:26.060 --> 01:09:29.660]   This is just a pilot program, $3 million.
[01:09:29.660 --> 01:09:32.380]   Welcome to the United States company.
[01:09:32.380 --> 01:09:33.380]   Let's figure this out.
[01:09:33.380 --> 01:09:36.500]   Let's throw $3 million at it and see how it works.
[01:09:36.500 --> 01:09:42.620]   They also may be deploying iOS devices to security officers and screeners.
[01:09:42.620 --> 01:09:43.620]   There are some-
[01:09:43.620 --> 01:09:46.700]   All I got to say is I hope it speeds things up because in the last couple of months,
[01:09:46.700 --> 01:09:49.460]   I have to say the TSA has gotten much slower.
[01:09:49.460 --> 01:09:53.380]   I'm not sure if it's because there's greater terrorist risk or something else, but things
[01:09:53.380 --> 01:09:55.820]   have gotten a bit slower.
[01:09:55.820 --> 01:09:57.820]   I feel positive that this is-
[01:09:57.820 --> 01:09:58.820]   This is going to make a difference.
[01:09:58.820 --> 01:10:00.140]   They're going to speed our lines up.
[01:10:00.140 --> 01:10:05.180]   They're going to start using FaceTime because it uses encryption that meets federal standards,
[01:10:05.180 --> 01:10:07.300]   including the HIPAA Act.
[01:10:07.300 --> 01:10:11.860]   Is it funny that they're using FaceTime because it has better standards, but IBM is not using
[01:10:11.860 --> 01:10:16.500]   security because it's a very interesting cross-section?
[01:10:16.500 --> 01:10:20.100]   Well, I think that's more about transparency than anything else.
[01:10:20.100 --> 01:10:25.780]   Remember that when Apple introduced FaceTime, Steve Jobs basically filled the entire screen
[01:10:25.780 --> 01:10:31.620]   with three letter and four letter acronyms for all the different standards that it supports.
[01:10:31.620 --> 01:10:38.220]   If the government has a standard saying, you can't use any video conference that does
[01:10:38.220 --> 01:10:43.020]   not use one of these three standards deemed insecure, then you're good.
[01:10:43.020 --> 01:10:48.060]   The problem is that Apple, we don't know what happens to data when it gets into a random
[01:10:48.060 --> 01:10:49.060]   data center.
[01:10:49.060 --> 01:10:53.380]   Chances are extremely likely that nothing happens because it goes into the same place
[01:10:53.380 --> 01:10:54.940]   where the Ark of the Covenant was stored.
[01:10:54.940 --> 01:10:59.700]   There's just so much stuff in there and such a small fraction of it is of any interest
[01:10:59.700 --> 01:11:03.860]   to anybody that there's just no point in trying to hammer through the security, but you don't
[01:11:03.860 --> 01:11:04.860]   know that.
[01:11:04.860 --> 01:11:07.820]   That's why people just don't tend to trust it.
[01:11:07.820 --> 01:11:12.420]   On the other hand, remember that Google has been under indictment, excuse me, is now in
[01:11:12.420 --> 01:11:17.340]   trouble from multiple governments in the world because of Google Street View Vans, where
[01:11:17.340 --> 01:11:22.140]   it knows that the Vans have been collecting a lot more data than simply GPS data, street
[01:11:22.140 --> 01:11:25.060]   data, and nearby Wi-Fi access points.
[01:11:25.060 --> 01:11:31.020]   And yet, every time that the highest government official imaginable says to Google, we demand
[01:11:31.020 --> 01:11:34.020]   that you turn over all this information so that we know exactly what your trucks were
[01:11:34.020 --> 01:11:40.580]   doing, they say, I'm sorry, top government security agency representative who's in charge
[01:11:40.580 --> 01:11:43.380]   of data security for all of its citizens of this country.
[01:11:43.380 --> 01:11:47.420]   I can't release that information to you because it would breach the privacy of the citizens
[01:11:47.420 --> 01:11:49.940]   whom we stole this data from.
[01:11:49.940 --> 01:11:51.380]   And okay, good?
[01:11:51.380 --> 01:11:55.900]   That's what we got paid to write that response for you.
[01:11:55.900 --> 01:11:59.780]   I hope you've loose fitting trousers for obvious reasons, but you're getting away with it for
[01:11:59.780 --> 01:12:00.780]   now.
[01:12:00.780 --> 01:12:03.340]   So it's all about transparency.
[01:12:03.340 --> 01:12:08.380]   You would like, I think Apple is probably the most trustworthy company of its size, where
[01:12:08.380 --> 01:12:13.700]   you trust that not only are they competent, they don't do the exact same thing, they
[01:12:13.700 --> 01:12:15.860]   don't accidentally have these data breaches.
[01:12:15.860 --> 01:12:19.940]   I'm sure that they're having a couple exceptions, but you buy in large, you trust them to know
[01:12:19.940 --> 01:12:24.140]   what they're doing, but also you do trust them to take seriously the idea that look.
[01:12:24.140 --> 01:12:28.580]   If we happen to collect this piece of information about GPS information off your phone, it is
[01:12:28.580 --> 01:12:34.620]   truly because we're just trying to create a map of, we're trying to create a run traffic
[01:12:34.620 --> 01:12:35.620]   map.
[01:12:35.620 --> 01:12:38.260]   We are not going to be repurposed for any other purpose.
[01:12:38.260 --> 01:12:41.020]   And now that we've found out that we've actually done that in an improper way, we're
[01:12:41.020 --> 01:12:44.900]   taking that away and making sure that you know that we've taken away this thing that
[01:12:44.900 --> 01:12:45.900]   people don't like.
[01:12:45.900 --> 01:12:48.660]   You're really not sure that Google will follow us the same map.
[01:12:48.660 --> 01:12:53.420]   And you know that Facebook is being actively hostile in making sure that they get as much
[01:12:53.420 --> 01:12:54.420]   information as possible.
[01:12:54.420 --> 01:12:59.540]   I mean, can you think of any company that you would least, you would less trust to build
[01:12:59.540 --> 01:13:03.980]   and design a phone from the ground up that is inside your pocket and follows you around
[01:13:03.980 --> 01:13:05.180]   forever than Facebook?
[01:13:05.180 --> 01:13:06.980]   I don't think so.
[01:13:06.980 --> 01:13:13.700]   Big auction at Sotheby's of Apple memorabilia, a circuit board, an Apple One circuit board
[01:13:13.700 --> 01:13:16.740]   hand built by Wozniak.
[01:13:16.740 --> 01:13:22.580]   There are 200 units were made, 50 survived, six in working order.
[01:13:22.580 --> 01:13:28.580]   They expect that the Apple One motherboard will go between 120,000 and 180,000.
[01:13:28.580 --> 01:13:34.420]   It also, the lot includes a cassette interface at several manuals, including a rare basic
[01:13:34.420 --> 01:13:37.700]   users manual.
[01:13:37.700 --> 01:13:43.180]   And Sotheby's is sold Apple Ones before this, an Apple One sold for $213,000 a couple of
[01:13:43.180 --> 01:13:44.780]   years ago.
[01:13:44.780 --> 01:13:46.700]   Here's the motherboard case you're interested.
[01:13:46.700 --> 01:13:51.380]   It says Apple Computer One and it's operational.
[01:13:51.380 --> 01:13:56.300]   So this is one of the five remaining operational.
[01:13:56.300 --> 01:13:57.300]   And then this is cool.
[01:13:57.300 --> 01:14:03.860]   This is a note from Steve Jobs that he wrote while he was at Atari.
[01:14:03.860 --> 01:14:05.940]   It looks like handwritten in pencil.
[01:14:05.940 --> 01:14:09.460]   Actually, I was looking at that a couple of days ago.
[01:14:09.460 --> 01:14:14.940]   It's actually, that's just like the cover addendum to a report he wrote on how to adopt
[01:14:14.940 --> 01:14:19.740]   a console, excuse me, an arcade game that Apple's, that Atari was developing, complete
[01:14:19.740 --> 01:14:23.820]   with like ideas for new circuits to add in to add new features to it.
[01:14:23.820 --> 01:14:28.460]   In addition to my report, which I forgot to type in under the section paddles, D cut
[01:14:28.460 --> 01:14:34.820]   E6 dash one jumper, E6 dash one to E6 dash two, the simple wire change.
[01:14:34.820 --> 01:14:40.180]   The simple wire changes the left defenseman to a format like this, which is the way I
[01:14:40.180 --> 01:14:42.260]   had it on the prototype if any questions see me.
[01:14:42.260 --> 01:14:43.260]   Well, that's kind of cool.
[01:14:43.260 --> 01:14:46.220]   They say this might go from a high is $15,000.
[01:14:46.220 --> 01:14:51.180]   10 to $15,000.
[01:14:51.180 --> 01:14:56.140]   And it was acquired by the present owner directly from Atari in 2002.
[01:14:56.140 --> 01:14:58.700]   That's kind of neat.
[01:14:58.700 --> 01:14:59.700]   That is neat.
[01:14:59.700 --> 01:15:05.300]   I'm going to see a lot more auctions like this as he becomes, he's not up there with Edison
[01:15:05.300 --> 01:15:12.980]   or Tesla, but in terms of nerds who nerds that the sort of nerd icon where I had another
[01:15:12.980 --> 01:15:18.260]   generation or two or three nerds are going to be very, are going to very much cherish
[01:15:18.260 --> 01:15:22.500]   a page that was actually handwritten by the great Steve Jobs himself.
[01:15:22.500 --> 01:15:26.820]   I think that he's one of those names that another generation or two is going to become
[01:15:26.820 --> 01:15:28.380]   a bigger, bigger deal.
[01:15:28.380 --> 01:15:31.820]   So I would be surprised to see a lot of speculation for this thing.
[01:15:31.820 --> 01:15:36.780]   Last year they had the original three page contract between WaaS, Jobs and Ron Wayne
[01:15:36.780 --> 01:15:38.060]   to found Apple.
[01:15:38.060 --> 01:15:44.540]   They thought that would sell for $150,000 and ended up selling for $1.6 million to Edward
[01:15:44.540 --> 01:15:48.780]   Cisneros, who is a Miami banker and investor.
[01:15:48.780 --> 01:15:49.780]   $1.6 million.
[01:15:49.780 --> 01:15:52.540]   So maybe this stuff will go for a lot more.
[01:15:52.540 --> 01:15:55.580]   Great Christmas gift, I think, for the out of the viewer family.
[01:15:55.580 --> 01:16:01.500]   I've said before, the previous generations in the 20th century, movies were the big,
[01:16:01.500 --> 01:16:03.580]   big center of adulation.
[01:16:03.580 --> 01:16:05.980]   The music was the big, big center of adulation.
[01:16:05.980 --> 01:16:07.740]   Sometimes cars, the big center of adulation.
[01:16:07.740 --> 01:16:11.140]   There's a whole generation which technology is really that thing that really speaks to
[01:16:11.140 --> 01:16:12.140]   us.
[01:16:12.140 --> 01:16:19.100]   So there was a time when you could buy Dorothy's Ruby Slippers from the Wizard of Oz for $3,000.
[01:16:19.100 --> 01:16:22.620]   And everybody thought, "Oh my God, can you believe that those old shoes from that old
[01:16:22.620 --> 01:16:23.620]   movie got $3,000?"
[01:16:23.620 --> 01:16:24.620]   Right.
[01:16:24.620 --> 01:16:30.100]   So it's like several hundred thousand dollars for not the actual ones, but for a demonstration
[01:16:30.100 --> 01:16:31.100]   pair.
[01:16:31.100 --> 01:16:33.820]   And so I think that this is kind of what we're going to be seeing as more of these artifacts.
[01:16:33.820 --> 01:16:37.340]   And now we can actually call them not just cheap junk that I wasted my money on at the
[01:16:37.340 --> 01:16:41.980]   MIT for the market, but actual artifacts are showing up.
[01:16:41.980 --> 01:16:47.780]   How else to explain was it $12,000 for the prototype, excuse me, the engineering sample
[01:16:47.780 --> 01:16:50.300]   iPad with the two dock connectors on it?
[01:16:50.300 --> 01:16:57.020]   Hey, just one nice note, Tim Cook turns down $75 million in dividends because Tim Cook is
[01:16:57.020 --> 01:16:58.020]   a big Apple stockholder.
[01:16:58.020 --> 01:17:05.380]   And you remember they declared a dividend, a $2.65 quarterly dividend on restricted units
[01:17:05.380 --> 01:17:07.980]   held by employees.
[01:17:07.980 --> 01:17:09.980]   Tim has said, "I'm not going to take it."
[01:17:09.980 --> 01:17:14.460]   And when I think it also, I don't think it's held by all employees.
[01:17:14.460 --> 01:17:18.300]   So I think that that's the things that some of the employees have restricted some don't.
[01:17:18.300 --> 01:17:23.380]   And so I think that there was definitely a potential firestorm awaiting on the other
[01:17:23.380 --> 01:17:26.740]   side of that payout that he doesn't really need because he's going to keep on probably
[01:17:26.740 --> 01:17:27.740]   making.
[01:17:27.740 --> 01:17:31.380]   That's a lot of money to walk away from, though, $75 million.
[01:17:31.380 --> 01:17:34.980]   He does have 300 and some million worth of stock.
[01:17:34.980 --> 01:17:35.980]   Right.
[01:17:35.980 --> 01:17:37.620]   And a company that has been doing okay.
[01:17:37.620 --> 01:17:39.220]   I guess he doesn't need it.
[01:17:39.220 --> 01:17:44.700]   There's an area of wealth in which you realize that the amount of money that you're turning
[01:17:44.700 --> 01:17:49.300]   down would kill you if it fell on you from 10 feet to the firm from 10 by 5.
[01:17:49.300 --> 01:17:50.300]   Okay.
[01:17:50.300 --> 01:17:52.300]   That's a different level of wealth than we're used to.
[01:17:52.300 --> 01:17:54.620]   You know, that's actually that's a good goal.
[01:17:54.620 --> 01:17:58.340]   I just want to make it a money that if it fell from 10 feet, it would kill me.
[01:17:58.340 --> 01:18:02.420]   Well, if it's in quarters, almost anything will kill you.
[01:18:02.420 --> 01:18:03.420]   We're going to take a break.
[01:18:03.420 --> 01:18:05.900]   Come back with our iOS and Lion Tip of the Week.
[01:18:05.900 --> 01:18:10.380]   And our picks of the week is Will Andy and Akko, Alex Lindsey and me talking Mac, talking
[01:18:10.380 --> 01:18:17.740]   smack, but first a word from Pond5, the world's stock media marketplace.
[01:18:17.740 --> 01:18:22.620]   These guys, again, you know, I, a lot of our sponsors and this sounds like a try to say
[01:18:22.620 --> 01:18:24.500]   this, but a really nice people.
[01:18:24.500 --> 01:18:28.900]   We met the Pond5 guys at CES, no, at NAB.
[01:18:28.900 --> 01:18:29.980]   And they're just, they really are.
[01:18:29.980 --> 01:18:30.980]   They're great.
[01:18:30.980 --> 01:18:36.300]   And they've created a really great marketplace for stock photos, video illustrations, vector
[01:18:36.300 --> 01:18:40.540]   illustrations, music, sound effects, just, it's just great.
[01:18:40.540 --> 01:18:45.220]   First of all, one of the reasons they have such a huge selection, a million plus video
[01:18:45.220 --> 01:18:52.660]   clips, seven million photos, a quarter million sound effects and new stuff all the time is
[01:18:52.660 --> 01:18:58.460]   because they give the best royalty rate in the business, 50% split with the artists,
[01:18:58.460 --> 01:19:00.540]   the creator, and you get to set your price.
[01:19:00.540 --> 01:19:02.660]   So you really could set how much you're going to make on this.
[01:19:02.660 --> 01:19:07.180]   They also offer free stock video, a video clip every week.
[01:19:07.180 --> 01:19:08.900]   This week, it is of a mountain biker.
[01:19:08.900 --> 01:19:13.100]   So you should go every week to Pond5.com and just download these.
[01:19:13.100 --> 01:19:16.420]   It'll be great in your presentations, your films, whatever you're up to.
[01:19:16.420 --> 01:19:19.460]   It's always nice to have and it gives you a sense of the quality.
[01:19:19.460 --> 01:19:24.460]   Almost all of the video clips are high death and the search tools on here are fantastic.
[01:19:24.460 --> 01:19:31.380]   Looking for, you know, almost anything, you'll find it, including things like audio logos
[01:19:31.380 --> 01:19:32.900]   and news and so forth.
[01:19:32.900 --> 01:19:35.660]   Let's play an advertising logo.
[01:19:35.660 --> 01:19:38.460]   That's for the holidays.
[01:19:38.460 --> 01:19:43.140]   So these are very affordable.
[01:19:43.140 --> 01:19:45.060]   This is tweet.
[01:19:45.060 --> 01:19:46.060]   I like that.
[01:19:46.060 --> 01:19:47.060]   I might use that one.
[01:19:47.060 --> 01:19:48.820]   That's nice.
[01:19:48.820 --> 01:19:53.220]   If you're doing production, if you're doing presentations, this is a great place to buy.
[01:19:53.220 --> 01:19:56.580]   If you make content, it's a great place to sell and often it's the same people doing
[01:19:56.580 --> 01:20:04.260]   both at the same time at Pond5Pond and the number five.com.
[01:20:04.260 --> 01:20:06.620]   Prices started just $5 for stock video and music.
[01:20:06.620 --> 01:20:09.380]   Look at that HDR time lapse of the Eiffel Tower.
[01:20:09.380 --> 01:20:11.940]   That is beautiful.
[01:20:11.940 --> 01:20:14.180]   And $2 for sound effects.
[01:20:14.180 --> 01:20:16.220]   Bora bora.
[01:20:16.220 --> 01:20:17.220]   Here's the deal.

[01:20:39.340 --> 01:20:45.700]   They really offer a very, very fair price.
[01:20:45.700 --> 01:20:46.700]   All right.
[01:20:46.700 --> 01:20:49.940]   Time for-- would you like to-- Alex, I know you've been busy, but would you like to do
[01:20:49.940 --> 01:20:51.460]   an iOS tip for us?
[01:20:51.460 --> 01:20:52.460]   Sure.
[01:20:52.460 --> 01:20:53.460]   Sure.
[01:20:53.460 --> 01:20:54.300]   Absolutely.
[01:20:54.300 --> 01:20:57.140]   So there's two things.
[01:20:57.140 --> 01:20:59.060]   One is a lot of people are, you know, travel.
[01:20:59.060 --> 01:21:00.820]   And sometimes they travel as much as I do.
[01:21:00.820 --> 01:21:01.820]   Sometimes they don't.
[01:21:01.820 --> 01:21:05.180]   But when you leave the country, one of the things you want to remember is that, you
[01:21:05.180 --> 01:21:08.420]   know, your international plan needs to be turned on.
[01:21:08.420 --> 01:21:12.540]   Now, one of the great things I have to say-- I don't say a lot of nice things about AT&T,
[01:21:12.540 --> 01:21:17.580]   but I will say that one of the great things is they actually manage this pretty tightly.
[01:21:17.580 --> 01:21:21.900]   And if you go over, a lot of times they're going to call you and tell you that you--
[01:21:21.900 --> 01:21:26.900]   I just got to call today-- told me that I had gone way over even my international bill
[01:21:26.900 --> 01:21:28.700]   now that I've been in London for a long time.
[01:21:28.700 --> 01:21:29.700]   Ooh, I've got a long time.
[01:21:29.700 --> 01:21:34.300]   But here's what's really interesting is the thing to know and the call ahead.
[01:21:34.300 --> 01:21:38.500]   There's actually-- they only tell you about one level of the AT&T international plan
[01:21:38.500 --> 01:21:40.940]   because they don't think anyone's interested in the higher level.
[01:21:40.940 --> 01:21:42.940]   There's a better level?
[01:21:42.940 --> 01:21:43.940]   Yeah.
[01:21:43.940 --> 01:21:44.940]   Yeah.
[01:21:44.940 --> 01:21:49.140]   So there's a 50-megabyte plan that most people know about.
[01:21:49.140 --> 01:21:50.900]   There's actually an 800-megabyte plan.
[01:21:50.900 --> 01:21:52.260]   Yeah, but how much is that?
[01:21:52.260 --> 01:21:53.260]   $1,000?
[01:21:53.260 --> 01:21:55.260]   No, it's not.
[01:21:55.260 --> 01:21:56.940]   I actually don't know.
[01:21:56.940 --> 01:21:57.940]   We just charged it.
[01:21:57.940 --> 01:21:59.180]   So I just have to-- I have to find out.
[01:21:59.180 --> 01:22:00.900]   It's probably five-thatter books at least.
[01:22:00.900 --> 01:22:06.660]   But it's something like-- I think it's another $200 on top of the $200 that you pay for international
[01:22:06.660 --> 01:22:07.660]   plan.
[01:22:07.660 --> 01:22:10.580]   But they called because they were like, "Okay, so you're going to get a bill for $600 and
[01:22:10.580 --> 01:22:12.140]   we'd like to help you avoid that."
[01:22:12.140 --> 01:22:17.980]   But what I thought was great was that they actually-- they called me in London today and
[01:22:17.980 --> 01:22:20.860]   told me that-- but they usually don't tell you about it unless you are--
[01:22:20.860 --> 01:22:26.500]   unless you're like me and decided that I'm here, I'm working in the--
[01:22:26.500 --> 01:22:29.780]   If you're there for a long time, you're going to need it.
[01:22:29.780 --> 01:22:35.420]   And so one of the things is that you want to know that that exists and call them and
[01:22:35.420 --> 01:22:36.500]   ask for it.
[01:22:36.500 --> 01:22:41.180]   The second one is that anytime you leave country and you think that whether you have
[01:22:41.180 --> 01:22:45.300]   an international plan or not, always remember to go into general-- there are other ways
[01:22:45.300 --> 01:22:50.780]   to do it, but minimum, go into general-- into your general area in your iPhone, go to usage
[01:22:50.780 --> 01:22:53.300]   and reset your usage.
[01:22:53.300 --> 01:22:58.180]   There's a usage that tells you time, but at the very bottom, there's cellular usage.
[01:22:58.180 --> 01:23:01.540]   And there you can have-- you'll see sent and received packets.
[01:23:01.540 --> 01:23:03.300]   And you can reset those statistics.
[01:23:03.300 --> 01:23:06.940]   And that is something that you should-- there are better, more accurate ways to log into
[01:23:06.940 --> 01:23:11.620]   your account at AT&T and make sure that that data is accurate.
[01:23:11.620 --> 01:23:13.700]   But it is key.
[01:23:13.700 --> 01:23:16.660]   Every time I leave the country, I turn that on just so I have just kind of a running sense
[01:23:16.660 --> 01:23:17.660]   because you'd be surprised.
[01:23:17.660 --> 01:23:20.740]   If you're checking Google Maps all the time in London, you'd be surprised how much--
[01:23:20.740 --> 01:23:23.740]   how many megabytes you're downloading to figure that out.
[01:23:23.740 --> 01:23:29.300]   And then finally, for the travel folks, is remember that getting cellular like little
[01:23:29.300 --> 01:23:33.980]   Wi-Fi in either Japan or London and many other places, those little Wi-Fi cards are
[01:23:33.980 --> 01:23:34.980]   pretty cheap.
[01:23:34.980 --> 01:23:40.540]   You know, you can get a little-- you know, one of those MIFIs or something like a MIFI,
[01:23:40.540 --> 01:23:46.260]   oftentimes for as little as $70, $70 or $80 that comes with five gigabytes of download
[01:23:46.260 --> 01:23:47.260]   or upload.
[01:23:47.260 --> 01:23:48.980]   And a lot of times it's pay as you go.
[01:23:48.980 --> 01:23:52.940]   You buy a little thing and you can just-- you can pay as you go with new little sims.
[01:23:52.940 --> 01:23:55.060]   And that could save you a lot of money if you have it just sit in your pocket.
[01:23:55.060 --> 01:23:58.220]   I've done that a lot in Japan and I started doing it here in London where I just bought
[01:23:58.220 --> 01:24:00.940]   one of those and just now I can-- you know, now I'm getting five gigabytes.
[01:24:00.940 --> 01:24:02.860]   I'm not talking about hundreds of megabytes here or there.
[01:24:02.860 --> 01:24:03.860]   And that's just with my phone.
[01:24:03.860 --> 01:24:06.420]   My phone is sinking to it via Wi-Fi.
[01:24:06.420 --> 01:24:11.300]   And so all of the real heavy data is being done with something locally and don't have
[01:24:11.300 --> 01:24:12.300]   to buy another phone.
[01:24:12.300 --> 01:24:13.460]   I don't have to change my sim.
[01:24:13.460 --> 01:24:16.660]   I don't have to-- you know, that-- all of those things I don't have to do to make sure
[01:24:16.660 --> 01:24:18.780]   that I localize my data usage.
[01:24:18.780 --> 01:24:23.020]   So a couple things for those of you who travel like me.
[01:24:23.020 --> 01:24:25.700]   Very good, our iOS tips.
[01:24:25.700 --> 01:24:26.700]   Thank you, Alex.
[01:24:26.700 --> 01:24:29.500]   And I concur, by the way, on the international travel.
[01:24:29.500 --> 01:24:33.100]   One of the reasons I carry my iPhone is because of that AT&T deal.
[01:24:33.100 --> 01:24:35.100]   And I can easily track usage and so forth.
[01:24:35.100 --> 01:24:36.860]   I think it's a good idea.
[01:24:36.860 --> 01:24:38.820]   Andy and I go, you have a lion tip for us?
[01:24:38.820 --> 01:24:40.820]   I'm a lion.
[01:24:40.820 --> 01:24:41.820]   Yes.
[01:24:41.820 --> 01:24:47.980]   And actually, one more thing-- one more note because I did use AT&T International roaming
[01:24:47.980 --> 01:24:49.860]   while I was in Ireland.
[01:24:49.860 --> 01:24:55.260]   What I found out is that you do-- they will actually-- if you call and ask, like, I bought
[01:24:55.260 --> 01:24:58.340]   like about 100 megabytes because I wasn't going to be using a whole lot.
[01:24:58.340 --> 01:25:02.260]   I wound up using only about 30 megabytes and I wasn't going to be traveling internationally
[01:25:02.260 --> 01:25:03.260]   again.
[01:25:03.260 --> 01:25:07.700]   So if you call, they will simply refund you the cost of the 70% of the amount you paid
[01:25:07.700 --> 01:25:09.100]   for but did not use.
[01:25:09.100 --> 01:25:10.100]   What?
[01:25:10.100 --> 01:25:11.100]   Yeah.
[01:25:11.100 --> 01:25:12.100]   It did crazy.
[01:25:12.100 --> 01:25:15.020]   AT&T knocks the international usage out of the park.
[01:25:15.020 --> 01:25:19.500]   I mean, they really-- there's a lot of things I don't like about it that I complain about
[01:25:19.500 --> 01:25:20.500]   with them.
[01:25:20.500 --> 01:25:24.540]   But I got to say, as an international user, I'm really hooked because of how well they
[01:25:24.540 --> 01:25:25.540]   manage users.
[01:25:25.540 --> 01:25:26.540]   Wow.
[01:25:26.540 --> 01:25:27.540]   When it comes to--
[01:25:27.540 --> 01:25:30.380]   I had no idea they'd refund you for the unused portion, though.
[01:25:30.380 --> 01:25:31.380]   Yeah.
[01:25:31.380 --> 01:25:32.380]   It was great stuff.
[01:25:32.380 --> 01:25:33.620]   And what else is absolutely true, too.
[01:25:33.620 --> 01:25:37.620]   I mean, if there is some sort of a screw up, like you thought you would enable it but
[01:25:37.620 --> 01:25:42.220]   you did not, or you forgot-- you thought you could get by without it but you wound up
[01:25:42.220 --> 01:25:43.220]   using it.
[01:25:43.220 --> 01:25:45.980]   It's just absolutely trivial to simply say, "Hi, yeah.
[01:25:45.980 --> 01:25:51.020]   Could we pretend that two weeks ago I bought, let's say, two gigabytes worth of international
[01:25:51.020 --> 01:25:54.540]   roaming because I watched a lot of Netflix on the other side."
[01:25:54.540 --> 01:25:55.540]   They will do that.
[01:25:55.540 --> 01:25:56.540]   They will do that.
[01:25:56.540 --> 01:25:57.540]   Yeah.
[01:25:57.540 --> 01:25:59.460]   I've had them do that as well.
[01:25:59.460 --> 01:26:01.940]   Mac OS tip is actually all about keynote.
[01:26:01.940 --> 01:26:06.980]   If you give lots and lots of presentations, I mean, there's a certain level of understanding
[01:26:06.980 --> 01:26:07.980]   about keynote.
[01:26:07.980 --> 01:26:11.580]   You go up to a certain point where you can actually just sort of be the things you can
[01:26:11.580 --> 01:26:15.460]   figure out just by playing with the app and then you don't go much farther.
[01:26:15.460 --> 01:26:20.700]   And then you really do have to, at some point, look for the whole list of commands and shortcuts
[01:26:20.700 --> 01:26:22.380]   and read the manual.
[01:26:22.380 --> 01:26:26.260]   I actually was kicking myself-- I've been using keynote for years-- and there are three
[01:26:26.260 --> 01:26:31.140]   really, really great keyboard shortcuts, just one letter as you're giving your presentation
[01:26:31.140 --> 01:26:35.620]   just tap this button and a wonderful thing will happen that you always wish you could
[01:26:35.620 --> 01:26:36.620]   make happen.
[01:26:36.620 --> 01:26:39.980]   You've ever been setting up a presentation.
[01:26:39.980 --> 01:26:45.500]   You're setting up for dual screen and for the life of you, you cannot have the presenter
[01:26:45.500 --> 01:26:49.780]   screen wind up on the screen in front of you and the slide screen wind up on the big
[01:26:49.780 --> 01:26:50.780]   projector.
[01:26:50.780 --> 01:26:53.100]   It doesn't matter how you can figure things and you finally say, "Screw it."
[01:26:53.100 --> 01:26:56.100]   I was going to go to mirroring because I don't want people to see.
[01:26:56.100 --> 01:26:59.940]   I don't want to count down time around the big 40-foot screen and I can't see what I'm
[01:26:59.940 --> 01:27:00.940]   doing.
[01:27:00.940 --> 01:27:07.300]   There's actually a shortcut, tap the X key and that will just-- no guesses, no, no, no,
[01:27:07.300 --> 01:27:09.500]   no, why is it where for?
[01:27:09.500 --> 01:27:13.060]   It will just simply switch whatever two screens you're using right now.
[01:27:13.060 --> 01:27:16.900]   If you plug in your projector and the screen is screwed up, tap the letter X, it will immediately
[01:27:16.900 --> 01:27:19.660]   switch and you're solved.
[01:27:19.660 --> 01:27:22.500]   The letter R will reset the timer immediately.
[01:27:22.500 --> 01:27:26.940]   If you started the timer going when you were introduced, but then there was a delay of
[01:27:26.940 --> 01:27:32.580]   some kind and now you don't know, "Okay, did the fire alarm take four minutes to do?"
[01:27:32.580 --> 01:27:38.860]   Oh, damn it, okay, tap the R button and that will restart the timer from zero.
[01:27:38.860 --> 01:27:44.380]   The really cool thing, which was the really huge kick myself in the pants, there are times
[01:27:44.380 --> 01:27:52.340]   when you're using Keynote as your main presentation tool, but you're giving a presentation that
[01:27:52.340 --> 01:27:57.620]   teaches people how to use aperture or something or maybe you want to dip into QuickTime Player
[01:27:57.620 --> 01:28:01.220]   to actually show a video but also be able to have a little bit more control over what
[01:28:01.220 --> 01:28:02.220]   goes on.
[01:28:02.220 --> 01:28:07.260]   There is actually a shortcut so that if you've been, if before you started the presentation,
[01:28:07.260 --> 01:28:13.340]   you were switching between QuickTime Player and Keynote, if you just tap the H button that
[01:28:13.340 --> 01:28:17.380]   will automatically switch you between Keynote and whatever the last used app was and back
[01:28:17.380 --> 01:28:18.380]   again.
[01:28:18.380 --> 01:28:21.540]   So you can be in the middle of your presentation and suddenly just realize, "Oh, wait a minute,
[01:28:21.540 --> 01:28:25.060]   I should really show you how to do this in Photoshop, tap the H button that will put
[01:28:25.060 --> 01:28:28.020]   you into Photoshop, do whatever you want to do, tap the..."
[01:28:28.020 --> 01:28:33.100]   And then when you have to, of course, command tab to go back into Keynote because obviously
[01:28:33.100 --> 01:28:36.980]   you're outside the Keynote environment, but it's just one key that will automatically
[01:28:36.980 --> 01:28:40.540]   switch you away from, or just slide you around to whatever your last app was and then it's
[01:28:40.540 --> 01:28:42.060]   easy to get back in again.
[01:28:42.060 --> 01:28:46.140]   But in any event, Keynote is definitely one of those things where you will get a lot out
[01:28:46.140 --> 01:28:50.300]   of it just by messing around with it and trying to figure out how things go on your own, but
[01:28:50.300 --> 01:28:55.020]   then sit down, download the manual, go to the support pages, and then you will find out,
[01:28:55.020 --> 01:29:00.900]   "Oh, that thing that I laboriously spent a half hour trying to fake is actually a one,
[01:29:00.900 --> 01:29:05.500]   a two-key-stroke keyboard shortcut that I could have done all automatically.
[01:29:05.500 --> 01:29:09.140]   Okay, lesson learned, I'm stupid."
[01:29:09.140 --> 01:29:14.620]   Well, you know, I do a lot of work where there's a lot of presentations and people are posting
[01:29:14.620 --> 01:29:19.540]   stuff on big screens and it's amazing to see when I started doing this, a lot of it was
[01:29:19.540 --> 01:29:23.500]   PowerPoint, a lot of people are trying to figure it out and you almost never, ever see
[01:29:23.500 --> 01:29:25.820]   anything but Keynote now in the background.
[01:29:25.820 --> 01:29:29.020]   You know, behind stage, I mean, everything's Keynote.
[01:29:29.020 --> 01:29:30.500]   I mean, it's just PowerPoint.
[01:29:30.500 --> 01:29:32.060]   I saw one today and I didn't even record.
[01:29:32.060 --> 01:29:35.060]   Someone had was using PowerPoint for something and I was like, "I didn't even recognize the
[01:29:35.060 --> 01:29:36.060]   interface.
[01:29:36.060 --> 01:29:37.060]   I hadn't seen it for so long."
[01:29:37.060 --> 01:29:38.060]   You know, it's just a $15.
[01:29:38.060 --> 01:29:39.860]   It's just an amazing application.
[01:29:39.860 --> 01:29:44.540]   I think it's time for our picks of the week.
[01:29:44.540 --> 01:29:45.540]   Can I start?
[01:29:45.540 --> 01:29:46.540]   Sure.
[01:29:46.540 --> 01:29:49.460]   I never start, but it's my turn to say something.
[01:29:49.460 --> 01:29:51.460]   Actually, I want to point out a few things.
[01:29:51.460 --> 01:29:56.860]   The both the App Store and the iTunes App Store have started doing editors' choices
[01:29:56.860 --> 01:30:00.700]   and apps of the week on the iTunes store for the iPhone.
[01:30:00.700 --> 01:30:03.260]   You can now get a free app every week.
[01:30:03.260 --> 01:30:06.300]   Amazon's been doing this for a while, Google as well.
[01:30:06.300 --> 01:30:10.900]   Right now it's cut-the-rope experiments free for a limited time and it's a fun game.
[01:30:10.900 --> 01:30:11.900]   I highly recommend it.
[01:30:11.900 --> 01:30:18.020]   So I guess we now all have to head to the App Store on a regular basis to check the editor's
[01:30:18.020 --> 01:30:19.020]   choice.
[01:30:19.020 --> 01:30:24.420]   And the editor's choice on the main App Store this week got me a big time.
[01:30:24.420 --> 01:30:30.700]   It's a program called Co-Book and it's a better address book and it really is.
[01:30:30.700 --> 01:30:31.700]   It's awesome.
[01:30:31.700 --> 01:30:32.700]   It's very cool.
[01:30:32.700 --> 01:30:37.580]   We'll sync with your standard address book in OS 10, but we'll also sync with LinkedIn,
[01:30:37.580 --> 01:30:42.500]   Twitter, Facebook and your Google contacts, which is what I use.
[01:30:42.500 --> 01:30:47.940]   So it becomes a very powerful address book that is right there in your menu bar at all
[01:30:47.940 --> 01:30:48.940]   times.
[01:30:48.940 --> 01:30:50.100]   I highly recommend this.
[01:30:50.100 --> 01:30:51.780]   It's just fantastic.
[01:30:51.780 --> 01:30:53.700]   It's absolutely free.
[01:30:53.700 --> 01:30:59.220]   You can see it brings in images, links and so forth from all of the sources for it.
[01:30:59.220 --> 01:31:01.500]   Very quick to search if I search for Lindsey.
[01:31:01.500 --> 01:31:03.220]   Alex Lindsey's going to pop up right away.
[01:31:03.220 --> 01:31:05.020]   I know he's 41 years old.
[01:31:05.020 --> 01:31:06.780]   His birthday is July 10.
[01:31:06.780 --> 01:31:07.780]   Other details will show up.
[01:31:07.780 --> 01:31:12.020]   If I want to edit this, you see it has an edit field right there and you can add a
[01:31:12.020 --> 01:31:15.340]   lot more to it.
[01:31:15.340 --> 01:31:16.340]   You can even favor it.
[01:31:16.340 --> 01:31:21.340]   I want to give you a little heart just because I like you so very much.
[01:31:21.340 --> 01:31:23.380]   No, I guess that's not for you.
[01:31:23.380 --> 01:31:24.380]   That's for Co-Book.
[01:31:24.380 --> 01:31:25.380]   Look at that.
[01:31:25.380 --> 01:31:27.380]   Just share it.
[01:31:27.380 --> 01:31:28.380]   It should be for you.
[01:31:28.380 --> 01:31:29.900]   I should give you a little heart.
[01:31:29.900 --> 01:31:34.100]   So this is a really, really nice address book that synchronizes with all the other address
[01:31:34.100 --> 01:31:38.180]   books that you might be using, including your social media address books.
[01:31:38.180 --> 01:31:39.180]   And it is free.
[01:31:39.180 --> 01:31:40.860]   It is called Co-Book.
[01:31:40.860 --> 01:31:41.860]   Really like it.
[01:31:41.860 --> 01:31:42.860]   Highly recommended.
[01:31:42.860 --> 01:31:46.260]   I have between Fantastical and Co-Book.
[01:31:46.260 --> 01:31:47.820]   I pretty much got everything in the menu bar.
[01:31:47.820 --> 01:31:50.820]   I don't longer have to run apps anymore.
[01:31:50.820 --> 01:31:52.380]   Cool.
[01:31:52.380 --> 01:31:56.740]   The menu bar is a little bit overloaded, as others have noticed whenever they see my
[01:31:56.740 --> 01:31:57.740]   Mac.
[01:31:57.740 --> 01:32:00.180]   Alex, your pick of the week, my friend.
[01:32:00.180 --> 01:32:03.140]   So this came out, I think, last week or the week before.
[01:32:03.140 --> 01:32:08.780]   So I've talked before about there was a program that Autodesk did where you can actually take
[01:32:08.780 --> 01:32:13.580]   pictures and turn them into 3D models and I can't at the moment think of what it used
[01:32:13.580 --> 01:32:15.260]   to be called, but they've changed it now.
[01:32:15.260 --> 01:32:17.460]   And it's called 1.2.3D catch.
[01:32:17.460 --> 01:32:19.900]   And it is available on the iPad.
[01:32:19.900 --> 01:32:24.100]   It is free and you should not walk and download.
[01:32:24.100 --> 01:32:26.540]   It is free and it is insane fun.
[01:32:26.540 --> 01:32:27.540]   That's all I got to say.
[01:32:27.540 --> 01:32:30.500]   So there's some great examples on there.
[01:32:30.500 --> 01:32:33.780]   It takes a little while to get used to learning how to do it, but it's, did I tell you the
[01:32:33.780 --> 01:32:35.300]   part where it was free?
[01:32:35.300 --> 01:32:37.260]   That is spectacular.
[01:32:37.260 --> 01:32:38.700]   It is spectacular.
[01:32:38.700 --> 01:32:42.220]   So I've been running around in London taking pictures of stuff.
[01:32:42.220 --> 01:32:46.580]   And you can, you basically, you turn this thing on and you, and then you just kind of
[01:32:46.580 --> 01:32:51.020]   click around an object and then you upload it to the cloud and it comes back down as
[01:32:51.020 --> 01:32:52.340]   a 3D model.
[01:32:52.340 --> 01:33:01.460]   And then now to, to make it even more insane, they have another program called 1.2.3D make.
[01:33:01.460 --> 01:33:03.220]   And I believe it's make.
[01:33:03.220 --> 01:33:04.860]   Yes, 1.2.3D make.
[01:33:04.860 --> 01:33:07.620]   And what, so you can, you can model something, create a 3D model.
[01:33:07.620 --> 01:33:08.620]   And this is free as well.
[01:33:08.620 --> 01:33:10.900]   It's on your iPad.
[01:33:10.900 --> 01:33:14.780]   And it will, it will give you the outlines that you would need to cut it out of cardboard
[01:33:14.780 --> 01:33:15.780]   and put it together.
[01:33:15.780 --> 01:33:16.780]   What?
[01:33:16.780 --> 01:33:17.780]   That's awesome.
[01:33:17.780 --> 01:33:18.780]   That's hysterical.
[01:33:18.780 --> 01:33:20.540]   Because I was going to say, I don't have a 3D printer.
[01:33:20.540 --> 01:33:21.860]   What are I going to do with these?
[01:33:21.860 --> 01:33:25.340]   You could, it's like, like, you can make your, like, you could make a cardboard.
[01:33:25.340 --> 01:33:28.900]   It like, you can take any 3D model and import it and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and,
[01:33:28.900 --> 01:33:30.060]   and make it.
[01:33:30.060 --> 01:33:31.460]   It's just hilarious.
[01:33:31.460 --> 01:33:34.020]   So, so 1.2.3D catch and 1.2.3D make.
[01:33:34.020 --> 01:33:37.580]   Now, some people might ask, where, like, can I download the 3D model to use it?
[01:33:37.580 --> 01:33:39.140]   In a 3D application?
[01:33:39.140 --> 01:33:42.980]   And the way that you would do that is to, you can go to your website, log in, because
[01:33:42.980 --> 01:33:47.540]   you're going to log in via Facebook or Twitter or G Plus or, and, and so you can do the same
[01:33:47.540 --> 01:33:52.260]   thing from their website and then you can download an OBJ file, which 3D folks will
[01:33:52.260 --> 01:33:53.260]   know what that is.
[01:33:53.260 --> 01:33:58.420]   So you can, so you can actually get 3D models that you can use in your 3D application if,
[01:33:58.420 --> 01:34:00.460]   if you so need, need to.
[01:34:00.460 --> 01:34:03.620]   And the, you know, as I said, it takes a little while to learn how to use it, but when
[01:34:03.620 --> 01:34:08.260]   it works, it works so well, like every little nook and granny.
[01:34:08.260 --> 01:34:11.820]   Now I'm kind of mystified why it's not available on the iPhone.
[01:34:11.820 --> 01:34:15.460]   So I'm assuming that at some point in the near future it will be, but right now it's
[01:34:15.460 --> 01:34:18.220]   an iPad, iPad app only.
[01:34:18.220 --> 01:34:19.220]   Very cool.
[01:34:19.220 --> 01:34:20.420]   Yeah, it's great.
[01:34:20.420 --> 01:34:22.180]   Very, very cool.
[01:34:22.180 --> 01:34:25.340]   And Andy and Ico, your pick of the week.
[01:34:25.340 --> 01:34:29.220]   Mine isn't quite so cool as that, but it's fun as that, at least.
[01:34:29.220 --> 01:34:34.340]   Earlier on today, it was, you know, as usual, like waiting for like Skype to finish its
[01:34:34.340 --> 01:34:36.820]   issues, you know.
[01:34:36.820 --> 01:34:39.900]   Yes, you were doing a great job too.
[01:34:39.900 --> 01:34:41.620]   We really appreciate it.
[01:34:41.620 --> 01:34:47.900]   And so entertaining three people and be fuddling anybody who knows how to play an instrument.
[01:34:47.900 --> 01:34:53.620]   This is a new app for the iPad called Fuchu, Fuchu horrible name, Fuchu Lele.
[01:34:53.620 --> 01:34:58.580]   I think they're going for a hybrid of future and ukulele.
[01:34:58.580 --> 01:35:02.020]   But it is actually a really pretty, can you hear that?
[01:35:02.020 --> 01:35:04.660]   It's actually pretty good ukulele simulator.
[01:35:04.660 --> 01:35:06.060]   Oh, that's wild.
[01:35:06.060 --> 01:35:09.580]   You get turning up the blame on the screen behind me.
[01:35:09.580 --> 01:35:11.820]   So this right.
[01:35:11.820 --> 01:35:13.740]   So you can actually.
[01:35:13.740 --> 01:35:14.740]   Oops.
[01:35:14.740 --> 01:35:22.580]   You can pre program like if you're, if you're, if you want to do devil in the deep blue
[01:35:22.580 --> 01:35:30.540]   sea like this, you can actually pre set all of the chords you need inside this pad and
[01:35:30.540 --> 01:35:31.780]   then.
[01:35:31.780 --> 01:35:32.780]   See.
[01:35:32.780 --> 01:35:41.180]   And so works pretty good.
[01:35:41.180 --> 01:35:43.140]   You can pre program a number of different songs.
[01:35:43.140 --> 01:35:44.940]   A bunch of them are built in.
[01:35:44.940 --> 01:35:47.220]   The intonation is pretty good.
[01:35:47.220 --> 01:35:48.220]   It is multi touch.
[01:35:48.220 --> 01:35:51.980]   So you can have, you can try to do, I don't know.
[01:35:51.980 --> 01:35:55.740]   You can try to do George for me strokes.
[01:35:55.740 --> 01:36:01.300]   Well, you can try of.
[01:36:01.300 --> 01:36:04.860]   I can barely do it on a real ukulele, let alone the fake one.
[01:36:04.860 --> 01:36:12.580]   But the real cool thing is, is that there is a iPhone app that's in the approvals process
[01:36:12.580 --> 01:36:17.460]   for the app store right now that will give you like a ukulele fretboard so that the fret
[01:36:17.460 --> 01:36:23.620]   but you're strumming on the iPad, but there is an actual fretboard on the iPhone.
[01:36:23.620 --> 01:36:27.780]   You can actually do traditional ukulele fingering with.
[01:36:27.780 --> 01:36:33.420]   And also in the next sometime in the summer, there is going to be third party, you guitar
[01:36:33.420 --> 01:36:39.020]   cases like a little like strip of plastic, like a little frame that holds the iPad and
[01:36:39.020 --> 01:36:42.820]   the iPhone in the same like sort of ukulele configuration.
[01:36:42.820 --> 01:36:46.740]   So it's not quite so hard to like hold them both at the same time.
[01:36:46.740 --> 01:36:51.020]   I almost, I used to travel with ukulele sometimes, but after the baggage restrictions started
[01:36:51.020 --> 01:36:56.660]   kick in where it would cost me $50 round trip to bring a bag with a ukulele in it.
[01:36:56.660 --> 01:36:58.820]   I kind of stopped bringing my ukulele places.
[01:36:58.820 --> 01:37:04.780]   Yeah, but if I got, I got myself an iPhone, I got myself an iPad, I might be willing to
[01:37:04.780 --> 01:37:10.260]   spend $20 or $30 for this little plastic frame so that if I do want to sort of rehearse
[01:37:10.260 --> 01:37:14.740]   my little ukulele distracted playing, I could actually do that.
[01:37:14.740 --> 01:37:18.180]   It's actually, it's not that bad.
[01:37:18.180 --> 01:37:26.980]   Unfortunately, there's also like, there's, when you see the transition to the bridge.
[01:37:26.980 --> 01:37:34.060]   You got me in between the double and the deep blue sea.
[01:37:34.060 --> 01:37:38.500]   See this, these chords are the killer ones I can't really do very well.
[01:37:38.500 --> 01:37:40.580]   I've got this one.
[01:37:40.580 --> 01:37:44.340]   I've got those good, which is why during the 10 minutes before the show, I'm playing
[01:37:44.340 --> 01:37:46.620]   just those four chords over and over again.
[01:37:46.620 --> 01:37:47.620]   It's rather exciting.
[01:37:47.620 --> 01:37:48.620]   You're practicing.
[01:37:48.620 --> 01:37:49.620]   I get it.
[01:37:49.620 --> 01:37:50.620]   I get it.
[01:37:50.620 --> 01:37:54.540]   I can actually do these barred chords on this one only because it involves me tapping
[01:37:54.540 --> 01:38:00.300]   one button instead of trying to make my finger do what George Harrison's fingers do after
[01:38:00.300 --> 01:38:03.460]   30 years of being a really exceptionally good guitar player.
[01:38:03.460 --> 01:38:04.460]   Five bucks.
[01:38:04.460 --> 01:38:06.980]   I mean, that's a lot of fun for five bucks.
[01:38:06.980 --> 01:38:11.140]   And if it's a, it pays for itself the first time they don't have to pay to ship my ukulele.
[01:38:11.140 --> 01:38:12.460]   Do you think you could learn you?
[01:38:12.460 --> 01:38:17.860]   Because that way I guess you could probably not because it's not, it's not just, it's
[01:38:17.860 --> 01:38:18.860]   fun.
[01:38:18.860 --> 01:38:19.860]   It's just the instrument.
[01:38:19.860 --> 01:38:24.100]   It's not for what you, for what you kind of want a ukulele for, which is just, oh,
[01:38:24.100 --> 01:38:26.220]   I'll have some fun with my friends and play music.
[01:38:26.220 --> 01:38:27.220]   That's good.
[01:38:27.220 --> 01:38:28.220]   Right.
[01:38:28.220 --> 01:38:30.780]   But to actually play the ukulele, it's not only, you know, doing the fingering, but it's
[01:38:30.780 --> 01:38:35.420]   also learning how that you've got to basically get your finger right next to the fret to
[01:38:35.420 --> 01:38:36.780]   get a good tone.
[01:38:36.780 --> 01:38:40.900]   You got to sort of learn, you know, how where your finger nail is.
[01:38:40.900 --> 01:38:46.900]   It does like, it took me like two days with my first ukulele before I could do this instead
[01:38:46.900 --> 01:38:54.380]   of, you know, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,
[01:38:54.380 --> 01:38:56.060]   hang on.
[01:38:56.060 --> 01:39:03.020]   It's, I know, I bucks a lot of fun for five bucks.
[01:39:03.020 --> 01:39:04.820]   Yuka Palooza 2020.
[01:39:04.820 --> 01:39:07.100]   You know, when I see, when I see a lot of those instruments.
[01:39:07.100 --> 01:39:10.020]   So one of the things, when you think about an Apple TV that would be really cool is to
[01:39:10.020 --> 01:39:13.620]   have like five iPads with all these different instruments all being able to link to your
[01:39:13.620 --> 01:39:17.500]   Apple TV in your living room and you can all like jam in a way and have the computer
[01:39:17.500 --> 01:39:21.580]   fill in the ones that you don't have and wouldn't be that hard.
[01:39:21.580 --> 01:39:26.340]   Alex Lindsey is in London where he is working with the Pixelcore, Pixelcore.com.
[01:39:26.340 --> 01:39:29.860]   If you want to learn more, are you going to reopen it to a membership set at any point
[01:39:29.860 --> 01:39:30.860]   soon?
[01:39:30.860 --> 01:39:31.860]   This summer.
[01:39:31.860 --> 01:39:32.860]   Oh good.
[01:39:32.860 --> 01:39:33.860]   Yeah.
[01:39:33.860 --> 01:39:34.860]   So we're going to reopen it.
[01:39:34.860 --> 01:39:36.540]   We're just doing a couple of shifts and then we're going to open it back up for folks
[01:39:36.540 --> 01:39:38.340]   to join very soon.
[01:39:38.340 --> 01:39:39.900]   Awesome.
[01:39:39.900 --> 01:39:45.740]   And of course, Pixelcore TV for the podcasts and I'm threatening to do a get together on
[01:39:45.740 --> 01:39:47.060]   Thursday night.
[01:39:47.060 --> 01:39:55.060]   And so if you're following me on Twitter or G+, you can find me pretty easily on G+.
[01:39:55.060 --> 01:39:56.060]   And he's dead.
[01:39:56.060 --> 01:40:00.940]   Well, he made it right to the very end before he froze solid.
[01:40:00.940 --> 01:40:03.580]   I love it.
[01:40:03.580 --> 01:40:04.580]   Thank you, Alex.
[01:40:04.580 --> 01:40:09.860]   Andy Inaco is at the Chicago Sun times where he catches great writing all the time.
[01:40:09.860 --> 01:40:14.420]   He's also, of course, on his website, Celestial Waste of Bandwidth.
[01:40:14.420 --> 01:40:19.340]   And his ukulele performing album is available soon at an iTunes near you.
[01:40:19.340 --> 01:40:20.900]   You do need to do a CD.
[01:40:20.900 --> 01:40:22.900]   You know that.
[01:40:22.900 --> 01:40:27.020]   You know, I really want to do it the Amanda Palmer method.
[01:40:27.020 --> 01:40:31.380]   But unfortunately that means me spending four years working really, really hard, performing
[01:40:31.380 --> 01:40:35.820]   for free for everyone who wants me to every single day.
[01:40:35.820 --> 01:40:40.300]   I'm not sure that either people would love my performances that much or if I would love
[01:40:40.300 --> 01:40:42.420]   performing quite that much.
[01:40:42.420 --> 01:40:43.420]   OK.
[01:40:43.420 --> 01:40:48.460]   Well, we'll just, you know, actually why not make it as exclusive here at Mac break weekly?
[01:40:48.460 --> 01:40:49.460]   Exactly.
[01:40:49.460 --> 01:40:52.220]   We'll do our own Twit Festival.
[01:40:52.220 --> 01:40:57.140]   And maybe perhaps you ever play on the Naco's Almanac?
[01:40:57.140 --> 01:40:58.140]   Not quite, not yet.
[01:40:58.140 --> 01:40:59.700]   But maybe I should think about doing that.
[01:40:59.700 --> 01:41:02.780]   No, no, I'm not encouraging it.
[01:41:02.780 --> 01:41:04.580]   I want it all to myself.
[01:41:04.580 --> 01:41:06.380]   You're all here.
[01:41:06.380 --> 01:41:10.740]   By not encouraging me to play anymore, you're way ahead of my audience.
[01:41:10.740 --> 01:41:11.740]   Thanks, Andy.
[01:41:11.740 --> 01:41:12.740]   Thanks everybody for joining us.
[01:41:12.740 --> 01:41:19.100]   We do Mac break weekly every Tuesday at 11am Pacific 2pm Eastern time 1800 UTC on twit.tv.
[01:41:19.100 --> 01:41:20.580]   You can catch a show live.
[01:41:20.580 --> 01:41:21.580]   Love it if you do.
[01:41:21.580 --> 01:41:24.900]   Chatroom, as you can see, is always a big part of our show.
[01:41:24.900 --> 01:41:27.540]   Sometimes they even pick the stories we're going to do.
[01:41:27.540 --> 01:41:32.260]   And if you can't catch a live, we make audio and video available after the fact for download
[01:41:32.260 --> 01:41:37.420]   on all the finer podcast aggregators, including Instacast.
[01:41:37.420 --> 01:41:38.420]   I didn't talk a little.
[01:41:38.420 --> 01:41:42.620]   I didn't talk about the Instacast flatter issue on iTunes.
[01:41:42.620 --> 01:41:45.060]   We'll have to talk about that.
[01:41:45.060 --> 01:41:47.060]   And where else?
[01:41:47.060 --> 01:41:48.620]   Oh, iTunes itself.
[01:41:48.620 --> 01:41:49.620]   You'll find us.
[01:41:49.620 --> 01:41:51.060]   Thanks for joining us and we'll see you next time.
[01:41:51.060 --> 01:41:54.500]   Now back to work because break time is over.
