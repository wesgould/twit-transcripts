[00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:07.200]   He's naked under his clothing, but that's okay because he's from the Hayward Fire Department.
[00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.000]   We know how firemen look under there.
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.840]   I did a podcast for someone from the Hayward Fire Department.
[00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:12.920]   Thank you for the hat.
[00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:14.560]   It is indeed one of my favorites.
[00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:15.560]   It's good.
[00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:16.560]   It's good.
[00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:17.560]   It's solid.
[00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:23.280]   It is a little reporting for the Chicago Sun times from time to time.
[00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:25.200]   And Suvids is on Turkey.
[00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:26.720]   So that's good.
[00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:28.760]   That's Renee Richie from Montreal.
[00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:30.520]   Are you doing Leo?
[00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:32.720]   Good to see you once again, Mr. Richie.
[00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:34.760]   Yeah, it's unseasonably warm here.
[00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:35.760]   So I don't know what to do with myself.
[00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:38.680]   It's like we're melting.
[00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:44.000]   And formerly from Canada, but now from the South Bay, Mr. Jim Dowlrimple of the Loop
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   in site.com.
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   He went inside today.
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   Yeah, I did.
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.280]   Tried to try and saw I don't get strafed by those planes.
[00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:53.640]   Yeah, it was also a little rainy up here.
[00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:54.640]   I don't know about you.
[00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:57.560]   Yeah, yeah, it is.
[00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:58.560]   Yeah.
[00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:01.360]   Well, congratulations, Apple.
[00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:03.720]   A battery is born.
[00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:10.120]   Apple's first iPhone battery, external battery.
[00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:12.280]   What do you guys think?
[00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:13.800]   I like it.
[00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:14.920]   Jim likes it.
[00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:16.680]   I like it.
[00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:19.560]   Why do you like it, Jimmy?
[00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:23.840]   You know, I have really good luck with iPhone battery.
[00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:31.280]   I don't usually find myself in a situation where I'm out of battery, but there are those
[00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:40.040]   times when, you know, when I go to NAM, the music show in LA every January, you know,
[00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:42.200]   you go all day, you're working all day.
[00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:46.800]   And then, you know, usually at night you can plug in your phone as long as it lasts the
[00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:48.280]   daytime, you're good.
[00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:53.600]   But there, you know, then it's time for dinner and, you know, going out afterwards and meeting
[00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:57.640]   all kinds of people in your phone, it will run out regardless of how good your battery
[00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:58.640]   is.
[00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:04.920]   So having something like this, I mean, and huge hours on it too.
[00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:06.000]   Huge hours.
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:07.720]   So that's pretty good.
[00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:09.920]   I wish they had one for the plus though.
[00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:12.160]   But that's, you know, plus doesn't really need it.
[00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:15.240]   But I think, you know, I mean, I would mind having it anyway.
[00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:16.240]   Yeah.
[00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:17.240]   It is time.
[00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:19.760]   I feel like some people were saying, "Why doesn't Apple just add extra battery to the
[00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:20.960]   iPhone?" and I think they did.
[00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:21.960]   The iPhone 6 Plus.
[00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:22.960]   Right.
[00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:25.080]   You know, if you want it internally, you get the iPhone 6 Plus.
[00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:28.040]   If you want it external, like you don't want it all the time, but you want it there for
[00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:30.760]   the conferences, the shows, and you need it, you get this.
[00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:34.240]   I saw a lot of people on Twitter making fun of the Humpty Hump, and I can't stop saying
[00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:36.520]   Humpty Hump because it sounds great.
[00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:38.480]   But like almost like the Luca and Yoda's back.
[00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:42.120]   But if you look at the traditional cases, if you look at the Mofis and things like that,
[00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:44.080]   everything is a compromise and everything is a decision.
[00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:47.400]   And I feel like Apple looked at those and said, "Well, there are two pieces and we kind
[00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:48.400]   of want one piece."
[00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:50.880]   And they kind of interfere with cellular and we don't want to do that.
[00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:55.040]   And if we just make it a naked battery with a little bit of silicon over it, then what
[00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:59.160]   we can do is make a hinge in it so you can easily put it on and take it off without
[00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:00.320]   breaking it into two parts.
[00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:02.240]   And we can also leave the antenna exposed.
[00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:03.960]   We can put some passive antennas in here.
[00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:07.560]   So it boosts the cellular signal and doesn't give you the same bar drops.
[00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:10.720]   And we can put like a two direct, a full on lightning port here so you can charge it
[00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:13.160]   at the same time as you charge the phone.
[00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:19.080]   And they sort of made a series of decisions that led it to having this sort of circa 2005
[00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:21.960]   trio extended battery hump on the back.
[00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:24.240]   But I think for some people that's going to be a better choice.
[00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:25.240]   I mean, yeah.
[00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:29.840]   And the other good thing is that if you have a doctrine accessory that's designed for the
[00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:32.880]   existing silicon case, it's the same profile.
[00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:35.360]   So it's supposed to use all those same things too.
[00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:39.240]   Oh, so basically the silicon case with the hump with Yoda on his back.
[00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:40.240]   Okay.
[00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:45.240]   I mean, you have to have a there's got to be a hump or a lump or a thickness because the
[00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:46.480]   battery got to go somewhere.
[00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:47.600]   Other people just smooth it over.
[00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:49.760]   They add it to a big move over thing.
[00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:50.760]   Yeah.
[00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:51.760]   That's a different choice.
[00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:52.760]   Yeah.
[00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:56.600]   Although Mofe also has more juice in theirs, I think it's not clear because Apple is not
[00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:59.760]   revealing how many milliamp hours this thing has, which is I fix it.
[00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:00.760]   I'll do that.
[00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:01.760]   Yeah.
[00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:02.760]   But just pit.
[00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:03.760]   Yeah.
[00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:04.760]   Come on, Apple.
[00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:07.160]   Just tell people, okay, you tell people how many you're in the phone.
[00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:08.160]   Why wouldn't you tell people?
[00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:12.680]   Anyway, they say it about doubles, which means it's probably roughly the same size as the
[00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:15.640]   battery in the success, which is what?
[00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:18.080]   2400 milliamp hours, something like that.
[00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:19.080]   28.
[00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:20.080]   I can't remember.
[00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:21.640]   Will you get one?
[00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:22.640]   Me?
[00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:23.840]   I got one for my son.
[00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:28.080]   I have a six S plus plus I've never run out of battery.
[00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:32.880]   I mean, I, I, you know, situations like you and NAM, which by the way is a very confusing
[00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:37.980]   thing to say, but when you're in NAM and you go all day or I go to CES and I go to
[00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:41.220]   CES and I go all day, which is the big difference between Dalrymple and me, he's in going to
[00:06:41.220 --> 00:06:46.880]   NAM and I'm just going to a consumer show, is that, you know, you don't have the opportunity
[00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:47.880]   to plug it in.
[00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:48.880]   Travel is another big one for me.
[00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:50.360]   I'm going to get up in the morning.
[00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:52.200]   I'm going to be traveling.
[00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:55.280]   I want to be able to get off the plane and still have phone juice left.
[00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:56.680]   There's no gold and no pink though, Leo.
[00:06:56.680 --> 00:06:57.680]   It's so sad.
[00:06:57.680 --> 00:06:58.680]   Just two colors.
[00:06:58.680 --> 00:06:59.840]   I, you know, I'm surprised.
[00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:02.920]   There's a black charcoal gray part me in a white.
[00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:03.920]   I got my son.
[00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:06.720]   You showed me someone on Twitter did a ping version and did look like a bandage.
[00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:07.960]   Yeah, it would.
[00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:08.960]   Yeah.
[00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:14.020]   I do like it that it's that soft silicone rubber that Apple uses in other places.
[00:07:14.020 --> 00:07:17.540]   The things, the things, the phones need to be made more grippy, that's for sure.
[00:07:17.540 --> 00:07:18.540]   Yeah.
[00:07:18.540 --> 00:07:19.540]   And they're beautiful cases.
[00:07:19.540 --> 00:07:20.540]   I mean, it's lovely.
[00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:21.860]   Feels kind of ugly to me.
[00:07:21.860 --> 00:07:25.260]   I mean, but I never saw a beautiful battery case.
[00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:26.780]   I'm with Renee.
[00:07:26.780 --> 00:07:31.020]   I'm glad that I blogged about it this morning saying I'm glad that Apple made a very practical
[00:07:31.020 --> 00:07:35.620]   design choice because time and time and time again this year we've been saying, my God,
[00:07:35.620 --> 00:07:37.420]   why didn't they put a clip on the pencil?
[00:07:37.420 --> 00:07:39.700]   Why did they put the charging port on the mouse there?
[00:07:39.700 --> 00:07:44.140]   And why did they make the magic keyboard just so stupidly thin?
[00:07:44.140 --> 00:07:47.860]   And I'm glad they just simply said the easy, the best solution for this is just to simply
[00:07:47.860 --> 00:07:48.860]   add a bump to it.
[00:07:48.860 --> 00:07:51.680]   And I know that Craig Hockenberry is going to say, I didn't even know you could that
[00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:53.700]   that a battery case could get knocked up.
[00:07:53.700 --> 00:07:57.380]   Ho, ho, ho, Craig Hockenberry, but this is the right design choice for us right now.
[00:07:57.380 --> 00:07:58.380]   Yeah.
[00:07:58.380 --> 00:08:01.940]   It's only surprising they're getting into this market because they've always seemed
[00:08:01.940 --> 00:08:04.620]   to be happy enough to leave us to third parties.
[00:08:04.620 --> 00:08:08.820]   So either this is just a product they wanted to design and sometimes that it's that simple
[00:08:08.820 --> 00:08:12.020]   or they just realized how much money they're leaving on the table by not making the success
[00:08:12.020 --> 00:08:13.020]   free.
[00:08:13.020 --> 00:08:15.340]   You get an advantage too because it's an Apple product.
[00:08:15.340 --> 00:08:17.060]   You'll see the batteries.
[00:08:17.060 --> 00:08:20.980]   Battery, double battery indicators and yeah, it's and you know, that's not going to explode
[00:08:20.980 --> 00:08:23.620]   on the charger like right like some of the things you buy.
[00:08:23.620 --> 00:08:27.140]   And also because they took some of the battery out with the battery is smaller because they
[00:08:27.140 --> 00:08:30.460]   put the tap to get in on the iPhone 6s and it's not as big as iPhone 6s.
[00:08:30.460 --> 00:08:31.460]   That's kind of neat.
[00:08:31.460 --> 00:08:32.460]   Yeah.
[00:08:32.460 --> 00:08:33.460]   Yeah.
[00:08:33.460 --> 00:08:36.260]   And this is a nice way to get the money off the table for the battery thing.
[00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:37.260]   Right.
[00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:39.660]   And also because Apple is such a high profile brand and they have that sort of level of
[00:08:39.660 --> 00:08:43.220]   integration, they can offer something that's well, I'm worried about the battery like,
[00:08:43.220 --> 00:08:44.780]   well, just get this battery case right here.
[00:08:44.780 --> 00:08:45.780]   Right.
[00:08:45.780 --> 00:08:46.940]   So it sort of solves a lot of problems for them.
[00:08:46.940 --> 00:08:47.940]   Yeah.
[00:08:47.940 --> 00:08:51.620]   I like the idea that you can kind of peel off the top because it's soft silicone rubber.
[00:08:51.620 --> 00:08:52.620]   Yeah.
[00:08:52.620 --> 00:08:54.300]   You don't have to snap something together.
[00:08:54.300 --> 00:08:56.820]   I lose the snap on parts for every time.
[00:08:56.820 --> 00:08:57.820]   Oh, I like it.
[00:08:57.820 --> 00:08:58.820]   I lose them and I break them.
[00:08:58.820 --> 00:09:01.820]   I mean, the reason why I look at the reason why I always travel with something like this
[00:09:01.820 --> 00:09:04.980]   instead of a case is because I don't like having to.
[00:09:04.980 --> 00:09:08.340]   It seems as though you're kind of stuck keeping it there forever because there's so much trouble
[00:09:08.340 --> 00:09:10.660]   to get it in and out of the case.
[00:09:10.660 --> 00:09:14.660]   And I just like the bill that had this as slim a phone as I can possibly have in the
[00:09:14.660 --> 00:09:18.660]   case that I want to carry it around in whatever that case may be.
[00:09:18.660 --> 00:09:21.020]   And this will also let me charge my iPad and other things like that.
[00:09:21.020 --> 00:09:26.940]   But I'm glad that Apple's deciding to bring their own design consideration to what for
[00:09:26.940 --> 00:09:29.260]   many people like Jim is an essential essential.
[00:09:29.260 --> 00:09:30.260]   Yeah.
[00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:31.260]   I'm very sensitive.
[00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:32.260]   You should absolutely shop around.
[00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:34.020]   There are much lower costs.
[00:09:34.020 --> 00:09:36.260]   They're always aware that there are third party solutions out there.
[00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:40.020]   So they don't, they're not forcing you to spend $100 on a, I don't know.
[00:09:40.020 --> 00:09:45.620]   Here's something that I didn't know, but I think thanks to Serenity, I know now, which
[00:09:45.620 --> 00:09:50.940]   is I, I assumed that the earphone jack on this was, was electronic, that it was connected
[00:09:50.940 --> 00:09:51.940]   via lightning.
[00:09:51.940 --> 00:09:55.420]   But in fact, it's just a whole, right?
[00:09:55.420 --> 00:09:57.700]   Just goes through into the phone body.
[00:09:57.700 --> 00:09:59.180]   I haven't seen it yet.
[00:09:59.180 --> 00:10:04.500]   Well, somebody pointed out that you're going to need an extender while it will fit Apple's
[00:10:04.500 --> 00:10:09.340]   headphones because of course, Apple knew there are some third party headphones, including
[00:10:09.340 --> 00:10:11.700]   Beats headphones that won't fit in that hole.
[00:10:11.700 --> 00:10:12.700]   I thought it was Serenity.
[00:10:12.700 --> 00:10:15.980]   Has anybody seen, has anybody seen one of the, have they shown any pictures of it outside
[00:10:15.980 --> 00:10:16.980]   of the case?
[00:10:16.980 --> 00:10:20.740]   Because it would seem as though they would just put a pass through in there.
[00:10:20.740 --> 00:10:23.580]   It's not so, yeah, I get, well, okay, let me, I'll try to find it.
[00:10:23.580 --> 00:10:25.660]   So Wolfie, I just, I handle and it ships with an extender.
[00:10:25.660 --> 00:10:27.420]   I can obviously get extenders with the Mofis.
[00:10:27.420 --> 00:10:28.420]   Yeah.
[00:10:28.420 --> 00:10:29.420]   So, I think that's a good question.
[00:10:29.420 --> 00:10:31.740]   Apple would want to go back to the, we, you need a dongle for the headphones thing they
[00:10:31.740 --> 00:10:33.140]   did to the first iPhone.
[00:10:33.140 --> 00:10:37.340]   Well, I'd like to recycle those jokes all over again because I'm very lazy, but I don't
[00:10:37.340 --> 00:10:38.940]   think they would do that.
[00:10:38.940 --> 00:10:41.940]   And it also, yeah, like Danny's point, it works with all the connectors and it also
[00:10:41.940 --> 00:10:46.220]   works with the brand new iPhone compatible SD card reader.
[00:10:46.220 --> 00:10:48.020]   Yeah.
[00:10:48.020 --> 00:10:49.780]   The silicone case comes in different colors.
[00:10:49.780 --> 00:10:54.220]   I'm surprised that they didn't just, you know, it'd be nice to have a product read.
[00:10:54.220 --> 00:10:55.620]   Maybe they're, oh, there we go.
[00:10:55.620 --> 00:10:57.520]   Here's a video.
[00:10:57.520 --> 00:10:58.520]   Is this Apple's video?
[00:10:58.520 --> 00:11:00.140]   No, wouldn't have an ad on it.
[00:11:00.140 --> 00:11:01.140]   This is somebody else's.
[00:11:01.140 --> 00:11:02.140]   Okay.
[00:11:02.140 --> 00:11:03.140]   This is Verge.
[00:11:03.140 --> 00:11:04.140]   The voyage.
[00:11:04.140 --> 00:11:05.140]   Verge.
[00:11:05.140 --> 00:11:06.140]   The voyage.
[00:11:06.140 --> 00:11:07.140]   Can you see that?
[00:11:07.140 --> 00:11:08.140]   Yeah.
[00:11:08.140 --> 00:11:09.140]   So it doesn't look like it's sticking anything in there.
[00:11:09.140 --> 00:11:10.140]   So I bet it's just a whole.
[00:11:10.140 --> 00:11:11.140]   Yeah.
[00:11:11.140 --> 00:11:13.820]   It's like it's just a whole, you know, and so whoever wrote this, I thought it was
[00:11:13.820 --> 00:11:14.820]   surrounding.
[00:11:14.820 --> 00:11:15.820]   Maybe it was Christina Warren.
[00:11:15.820 --> 00:11:18.580]   Maybe somebody from the Verge said that she could put her Apple headphones in there,
[00:11:18.580 --> 00:11:22.580]   but her Beats headphones were too thick and would need an extender.
[00:11:22.580 --> 00:11:23.580]   Or drill bit.
[00:11:23.580 --> 00:11:24.580]   Why?
[00:11:24.580 --> 00:11:25.580]   Or drill bit.
[00:11:25.580 --> 00:11:26.580]   Yeah.
[00:11:26.580 --> 00:11:27.580]   I think it's interesting.
[00:11:27.580 --> 00:11:28.580]   This is the second device.
[00:11:28.580 --> 00:11:30.180]   It's not coming in like a range of colors.
[00:11:30.180 --> 00:11:34.360]   Like I was surprised that the iPad Pro cases and stuff that's only available in gray.
[00:11:34.360 --> 00:11:37.200]   Are they getting more conservative in their ranges before they figure out what people
[00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:38.200]   actually want?
[00:11:38.200 --> 00:11:42.840]   I would guess that they want you all to buy black and white and then when the red one
[00:11:42.840 --> 00:11:44.280]   comes out by that too.
[00:11:44.280 --> 00:11:45.640]   Black is always the most popular car.
[00:11:45.640 --> 00:11:48.600]   Like most people almost always just buy black is a little black dress or the little black
[00:11:48.600 --> 00:11:51.720]   shirt and then like you add more colors depending on what you think the product makes
[00:11:51.720 --> 00:11:52.720]   is going to be.
[00:11:52.720 --> 00:11:54.480]   But this stuff is a little more expensive.
[00:11:54.480 --> 00:11:56.480]   Jim, come on.
[00:11:56.480 --> 00:11:57.480]   You're not as Canadian.
[00:11:57.480 --> 00:12:03.180]   But yeah, but like you start off conservatively because these are it's almost inexpensive
[00:12:03.180 --> 00:12:07.160]   to make a Silicon case, but we started adding battery or keyboards or things like that to
[00:12:07.160 --> 00:12:08.880]   it then or over their niche products.
[00:12:08.880 --> 00:12:12.300]   It probably amps up the expense, especially when you're doing tons of them at once.
[00:12:12.300 --> 00:12:15.220]   I can't believe we just spent 10 minutes talking about it.
[00:12:15.220 --> 00:12:17.240]   I can't believe it was launching a product.
[00:12:17.240 --> 00:12:19.460]   There's just no, it's not much other Apple news today.
[00:12:19.460 --> 00:12:21.320]   I mean, how are we going to fill this time?
[00:12:21.320 --> 00:12:24.340]   I knew Apple product is oh is like Christmas, my friends.
[00:12:24.340 --> 00:12:29.840]   But they're releasing products late in December, which makes advent calendars cry and they're
[00:12:29.840 --> 00:12:31.640]   releasing so many products this year.
[00:12:31.640 --> 00:12:34.200]   We're trying to do a quick count of it and it's just so much.
[00:12:34.200 --> 00:12:37.400]   Do you remember a couple of years ago, Apple hasn't released anything and it's June by
[00:12:37.400 --> 00:12:41.000]   now doomed and then this year is almost like revenge for that.
[00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:46.720]   Well, it also raises an interesting, okay, so the lightning, the lightning is a physical
[00:12:46.720 --> 00:12:47.720]   connector.
[00:12:47.720 --> 00:12:52.240]   There you go and shown it just right in there.
[00:12:52.240 --> 00:12:56.420]   But the headphone is just a whole.
[00:12:56.420 --> 00:12:57.420]   That's the Mophie.
[00:12:57.420 --> 00:12:58.420]   Here's the Mophie.
[00:12:58.420 --> 00:13:03.220]   So there's one other thing to make note of that the default, the no Mophie gives you
[00:13:03.220 --> 00:13:08.700]   a choice of whether you're charging the phone and the Mophie or just the Mophie.
[00:13:08.700 --> 00:13:17.540]   This one you're charging the phone and the case, but it keeps the phone at 100% if the
[00:13:17.540 --> 00:13:19.540]   case runs down.
[00:13:19.540 --> 00:13:24.300]   I think this is the way I use the Mophie, but it's not necessarily the fault.
[00:13:24.300 --> 00:13:27.200]   If you remove the case, you're guaranteed your phone is at 100%.
[00:13:27.200 --> 00:13:31.280]   So the case drains first, I guess is what I'm saying.
[00:13:31.280 --> 00:13:35.360]   The Mophie you can choose.
[00:13:35.360 --> 00:13:42.900]   And so when you charge, if you have enough juice, it'll charge the battery, which then
[00:13:42.900 --> 00:13:43.900]   charges.
[00:13:43.900 --> 00:13:46.100]   Even charges the phone first and then case.
[00:13:46.100 --> 00:13:47.100]   Okay.
[00:13:47.100 --> 00:13:52.460]   So there's no one.
[00:13:52.460 --> 00:13:56.780]   It's going to be interesting to see the tear down just to see what kind of antennas are
[00:13:56.780 --> 00:13:57.780]   there.
[00:13:57.780 --> 00:13:58.780]   How many controllers are there?
[00:13:58.780 --> 00:13:59.780]   Yeah.
[00:13:59.780 --> 00:14:00.940]   And I hope the turns make me sad.
[00:14:00.940 --> 00:14:03.140]   Well, he's one less case in the world.
[00:14:03.140 --> 00:14:04.140]   That's true.
[00:14:04.140 --> 00:14:06.020]   They make me sad as will it blend.
[00:14:06.020 --> 00:14:07.020]   That makes me sad.
[00:14:07.020 --> 00:14:08.020]   That makes me sad too.
[00:14:08.020 --> 00:14:09.020]   Yeah.
[00:14:09.020 --> 00:14:10.020]   That's when I cry.
[00:14:10.020 --> 00:14:11.020]   Take it perfectly.
[00:14:11.020 --> 00:14:16.140]   Good iPhone and turn it into carbon dust.
[00:14:16.140 --> 00:14:20.060]   And then there's a little port so that the sound, because the speakers on the iPhone
[00:14:20.060 --> 00:14:22.460]   are in the bottom on the six, right?
[00:14:22.460 --> 00:14:24.460]   Aren't they?
[00:14:24.460 --> 00:14:27.580]   And the speakers on the bottom on life, on the six S plus.
[00:14:27.580 --> 00:14:29.460]   Yeah, they've got an acoustic chamber or something.
[00:14:29.460 --> 00:14:31.780]   They have something because there's a little, I know there's a little port.
[00:14:31.780 --> 00:14:34.340]   Well, that would, maybe that's for the mic.
[00:14:34.340 --> 00:14:36.340]   I don't know.
[00:14:36.340 --> 00:14:39.660]   Anyway, you have many choices in the world.
[00:14:39.660 --> 00:14:46.100]   I do want to talk a little bit about products and Apple's kind of proliferation of products
[00:14:46.100 --> 00:14:49.260]   and we'll do this in a second.
[00:14:49.260 --> 00:14:55.620]   When Steve Jobs came back to Apple, he drew the famous quadrant, the plus sign and said,
[00:14:55.620 --> 00:15:00.220]   four categories, pro consumer, desktop portable.
[00:15:00.220 --> 00:15:01.220]   That's it.
[00:15:01.220 --> 00:15:03.300]   We're killing everything else.
[00:15:03.300 --> 00:15:04.540]   They've gone kind of the other way.
[00:15:04.540 --> 00:15:05.620]   There's a lot of skews.
[00:15:05.620 --> 00:15:08.100]   We'll talk about that in just a bit.
[00:15:08.100 --> 00:15:09.100]   Jim Dowrymple is here.
[00:15:09.100 --> 00:15:10.100]   He's no longer sad.
[00:15:10.100 --> 00:15:12.460]   He's cheered up.
[00:15:12.460 --> 00:15:13.460]   He's feeling better.
[00:15:13.460 --> 00:15:14.460]   I hope.
[00:15:14.460 --> 00:15:15.460]   That's good.
[00:15:15.460 --> 00:15:16.460]   I feel good.
[00:15:16.460 --> 00:15:17.580]   No, no, no, no, no, no.
[00:15:17.580 --> 00:15:19.340]   It would now.
[00:15:19.340 --> 00:15:22.900]   Well, this is the season that little kids come rushing up to him all happy and laughing
[00:15:22.900 --> 00:15:23.900]   for toys.
[00:15:23.900 --> 00:15:26.860]   So if he's got a hook on his face, he can get a good damage.
[00:15:26.860 --> 00:15:28.900]   Mommy, Mommy, Santa's a Bruins fan.
[00:15:28.900 --> 00:15:29.900]   Death Metal Santa.
[00:15:29.900 --> 00:15:31.300]   I love him.
[00:15:31.300 --> 00:15:34.740]   Mommy, why is Santa Claus drinking a hot napkin?
[00:15:34.740 --> 00:15:37.180]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:15:37.180 --> 00:15:38.260]   Rawr.
[00:15:38.260 --> 00:15:39.260]   Death Metal Santa.
[00:15:39.260 --> 00:15:40.580]   That's a good one.
[00:15:40.580 --> 00:15:44.060]   Also, Renee Richie, who's just the happy Santa?
[00:15:44.060 --> 00:15:47.060]   He's the martial arts Santa from MyMore.com.
[00:15:47.060 --> 00:15:49.260]   Jim's from the loop, loopinsight.com.
[00:15:49.260 --> 00:15:52.460]   And of course, from the Chicago Sun Times, Andy and not Cole.
[00:15:52.460 --> 00:15:54.460]   And I'm the Scrooge Santa.
[00:15:54.460 --> 00:15:55.460]   He's scratching.
[00:15:55.460 --> 00:15:56.460]   I'm big.
[00:15:56.460 --> 00:15:57.460]   I'm pretty.
[00:15:57.460 --> 00:15:58.460]   I'm a ha ha ha.
[00:15:58.460 --> 00:15:59.860]   Our show today brought to you by Squarespace.
[00:15:59.860 --> 00:16:04.860]   You know, I was just thinking, a good Christmas gift would be your geek.
[00:16:04.860 --> 00:16:06.500]   You have a friend who needs a website.
[00:16:06.500 --> 00:16:10.060]   Set up a Squarespace site for them and gift it to them.
[00:16:10.060 --> 00:16:14.060]   And that'd be kind of a nice gift.
[00:16:14.060 --> 00:16:17.300]   Squarespace is where leoville.com, my blog lives.
[00:16:17.300 --> 00:16:21.860]   It looks good, I gotta say, whether you need a simple cover page or your photographer
[00:16:21.860 --> 00:16:27.740]   or artist and you need a portfolio, maybe you want a blog for your business or for yourself.
[00:16:27.740 --> 00:16:29.620]   An online store, I use it in my personal blog.
[00:16:29.620 --> 00:16:30.620]   I just love it.
[00:16:30.620 --> 00:16:33.060]   But it's kind of professional too because I use the cover page feature.
[00:16:33.060 --> 00:16:37.820]   So if you just go to leoville.com, you just see the cover page and a slideshow of images
[00:16:37.820 --> 00:16:39.340]   that you can dig deeper in.
[00:16:39.340 --> 00:16:42.300]   I got a calendar in there and all that stuff.
[00:16:42.300 --> 00:16:44.100]   Sites look, yeah, there it is.
[00:16:44.100 --> 00:16:45.700]   I just love that.
[00:16:45.700 --> 00:16:48.380]   I just really happy with Squarespace.
[00:16:48.380 --> 00:16:52.900]   I put it off for a long time and I'm sorry I did.
[00:16:52.900 --> 00:16:54.420]   Sites look professional.
[00:16:54.420 --> 00:16:56.700]   You don't need to be a site designer.
[00:16:56.700 --> 00:16:58.940]   I did it all with point and click.
[00:16:58.940 --> 00:16:59.940]   No coding required.
[00:16:59.940 --> 00:17:03.260]   Of course, if you want to get geeky, there are plenty of customizable sites.
[00:17:03.260 --> 00:17:06.060]   So you can even put an animated GIF in there, which I like.
[00:17:06.060 --> 00:17:09.700]   Fonts, colors, page configurations.
[00:17:09.700 --> 00:17:11.580]   There's my photo portfolio, which I like.
[00:17:11.580 --> 00:17:15.300]   And you know, I can use the portfolio app on my iPad with my photo portfolio.
[00:17:15.300 --> 00:17:18.460]   If you're a photographer, you set up the webpage, but the portfolio app lets you go
[00:17:18.460 --> 00:17:21.020]   to a bride or a client and say, "Here's your images.
[00:17:21.020 --> 00:17:22.540]   It's really great."
[00:17:22.540 --> 00:17:28.140]   All their sites work great on a full-size 27-inch screen or on mobile.
[00:17:28.140 --> 00:17:29.940]   That means they're what they call responsive.
[00:17:29.940 --> 00:17:32.260]   There's my audible reading list.
[00:17:32.260 --> 00:17:34.660]   It's the last thing I posted up there.
[00:17:34.660 --> 00:17:37.340]   So your websites look great on any size device.
[00:17:37.340 --> 00:17:41.580]   Don't judge me on my design though because I decided to go really simple, really clean,
[00:17:41.580 --> 00:17:43.580]   but you can get as fancy as you want.
[00:17:43.580 --> 00:17:45.380]   I love Squarespace.
[00:17:45.380 --> 00:17:46.380]   Pricing is simple too.
[00:17:46.380 --> 00:17:49.220]   You can get a free custom and domain with an annual purchase.
[00:17:49.220 --> 00:17:55.060]   So if you need my site, mygreatsite.com, you can get it.
[00:17:55.060 --> 00:17:57.180]   Power your business with Squarespace Commerce.
[00:17:57.180 --> 00:17:59.260]   Commerce available on all their templates.
[00:17:59.260 --> 00:18:03.500]   It's the only platform that lets you create, manage, and brand your store so that it looks
[00:18:03.500 --> 00:18:05.260]   as good as your business.
[00:18:05.260 --> 00:18:11.120]   It has the look and feel of your business and they have a basic plan or an advanced
[00:18:11.120 --> 00:18:14.340]   plan so your business can grow as you need more.
[00:18:14.340 --> 00:18:17.780]   Plus they have an incredible 24/7 customer support.
[00:18:17.780 --> 00:18:22.180]   So if you're a restaurant, a musician, are you getting married?
[00:18:22.180 --> 00:18:23.180]   Squarespace is for you.
[00:18:23.180 --> 00:18:24.180]   And what a great gift.
[00:18:24.180 --> 00:18:27.220]   You can go to squarespace.com, click Get Started.
[00:18:27.220 --> 00:18:31.220]   You can set up a site for somebody for nothing and then gift it to them.
[00:18:31.220 --> 00:18:36.220]   It's paid nothing.
[00:18:36.220 --> 00:18:38.420]   It's like a handmade gift.
[00:18:38.420 --> 00:18:39.420]   It's great.
[00:18:39.420 --> 00:18:42.220]   Start your free trial with no credit card required.
[00:18:42.220 --> 00:18:43.220]   Squarespace.com.
[00:18:43.220 --> 00:18:44.420]   Make sure you use a promo code.
[00:18:44.420 --> 00:18:47.540]   Macbreak when you sign up, you get 10% off.
[00:18:47.540 --> 00:18:49.540]   And of course, show your support for the show.
[00:18:49.540 --> 00:18:51.980]   Squarespace, I didn't use Macbreak when I signed up.
[00:18:51.980 --> 00:18:53.660]   So could you just...
[00:18:53.660 --> 00:18:56.980]   What the heck?
[00:18:56.980 --> 00:18:57.980]   You do it.
[00:18:57.980 --> 00:19:02.220]   Squarespace.com, off for code Macbreak to get 10% off.
[00:19:02.220 --> 00:19:07.660]   We're talking Apple.
[00:19:07.660 --> 00:19:09.220]   You using an F and done?
[00:19:09.220 --> 00:19:11.180]   Jason Klameth is using Squarespace too.
[00:19:11.180 --> 00:19:12.180]   Yeah.
[00:19:12.180 --> 00:19:13.180]   We'll use you next time.
[00:19:13.180 --> 00:19:14.180]   We'll try to...
[00:19:14.180 --> 00:19:15.180]   Because it's fun because I like to try to bring sites down.
[00:19:15.180 --> 00:19:17.380]   Of course, you can't with Squarespace.
[00:19:17.380 --> 00:19:19.100]   Ford Sync Car Owners.
[00:19:19.100 --> 00:19:20.900]   This is really good news.
[00:19:20.900 --> 00:19:25.420]   They're going to get Apple Siri Eyes Free.
[00:19:25.420 --> 00:19:31.620]   This is an update to existing Sync Owners.
[00:19:31.620 --> 00:19:33.220]   I didn't even know you could do that.
[00:19:33.220 --> 00:19:34.220]   Ford announced this.
[00:19:34.220 --> 00:19:38.660]   It's called a Siri Eyes Free Update.
[00:19:38.660 --> 00:19:41.620]   That means Sync Vehicle is dating back to 2011.
[00:19:41.620 --> 00:19:42.980]   That's more than 5 million cars.
[00:19:42.980 --> 00:19:50.140]   As soon as you get in the car with your iPhone, you can start using Siri to make and receive
[00:19:50.140 --> 00:19:53.820]   phone calls, listen to music, get driving directions, check calendar appointments via voice
[00:19:53.820 --> 00:19:54.820]   commands.
[00:19:54.820 --> 00:19:55.820]   I'm sad.
[00:19:55.820 --> 00:20:00.040]   I traded in my Mustang now.
[00:20:00.040 --> 00:20:01.140]   That's really nice.
[00:20:01.140 --> 00:20:03.220]   I didn't even know you could do that.
[00:20:03.220 --> 00:20:05.320]   This is kind of an interesting...
[00:20:05.320 --> 00:20:09.420]   The update is tricky depending on which Ford you have.
[00:20:09.420 --> 00:20:13.900]   You might have to download it inside, put it on a USB drive, and then plug it into your
[00:20:13.900 --> 00:20:14.900]   car.
[00:20:14.900 --> 00:20:15.900]   I guess not that tricky.
[00:20:15.900 --> 00:20:18.500]   Those are the ones that do run the Microsoft embedded or that don't run the Microsoft.
[00:20:18.500 --> 00:20:19.500]   They do, right?
[00:20:19.500 --> 00:20:22.100]   Sync is based on Microsoft Car.
[00:20:22.100 --> 00:20:23.540]   I thought they were moving off of this.
[00:20:23.540 --> 00:20:24.540]   They are.
[00:20:24.540 --> 00:20:29.820]   In fact, they're going to do car play at some point, but this is pre-car play.
[00:20:29.820 --> 00:20:31.860]   This goes back four years.
[00:20:31.860 --> 00:20:32.860]   Awesome.
[00:20:32.860 --> 00:20:33.860]   Yeah.
[00:20:33.860 --> 00:20:37.140]   It reflects Apple's pre-car play strategy.
[00:20:37.140 --> 00:20:38.140]   Oh, yeah?
[00:20:38.140 --> 00:20:39.140]   It didn't.
[00:20:39.140 --> 00:20:43.940]   They announced the Siri component way before car play.
[00:20:43.940 --> 00:20:44.940]   Oh, interesting.
[00:20:44.940 --> 00:20:49.540]   This is the My Ford Touch vehicles.
[00:20:49.540 --> 00:20:50.540]   Okay.
[00:20:50.540 --> 00:20:51.740]   This is not a new thing then, Andy.
[00:20:51.740 --> 00:20:55.700]   This is just for doing something that others have...
[00:20:55.700 --> 00:20:57.980]   Are other manufacturers doing this already?
[00:20:57.980 --> 00:20:58.980]   Yeah.
[00:20:58.980 --> 00:21:04.220]   There's just been a limited number of cars that have supported that one feature.
[00:21:04.220 --> 00:21:05.740]   It's kind of old school stuff.
[00:21:05.740 --> 00:21:06.900]   There was a time when there were just...
[00:21:06.900 --> 00:21:13.740]   There were so many half arsed versions of Android compatibility and Siri and Apple compatibility.
[00:21:13.740 --> 00:21:19.540]   It wasn't until Android for the car and Apple and iOS for the car came out that they finally
[00:21:19.540 --> 00:21:23.100]   had a real strategy for actually APIs and broadcasting stuff to the stuff.
[00:21:23.100 --> 00:21:25.220]   It was almost all hardware before that.
[00:21:25.220 --> 00:21:26.220]   Cool.
[00:21:26.220 --> 00:21:29.780]   Actually, it kind of backs up this other story about Apple Maps.
[00:21:29.780 --> 00:21:33.780]   Apparently, it is completely dominant now.
[00:21:33.780 --> 00:21:37.700]   Well, of course, it's the default on an iPhone.
[00:21:37.700 --> 00:21:40.220]   So it's those Apple music though.
[00:21:40.220 --> 00:21:41.220]   Yeah.
[00:21:41.220 --> 00:21:42.220]   Yeah.
[00:21:42.220 --> 00:21:43.220]   Yeah.
[00:21:43.220 --> 00:21:46.900]   So, I mean, it may be that people would choose Google if built in and free.
[00:21:46.900 --> 00:21:47.900]   Yeah.
[00:21:47.900 --> 00:21:48.900]   Yeah.
[00:21:48.900 --> 00:21:53.660]   And also remember that any time someone makes a request that requires a map by default, it
[00:21:53.660 --> 00:21:54.860]   goes to Apple Maps.
[00:21:54.860 --> 00:21:55.860]   Right.
[00:21:55.860 --> 00:21:56.860]   All right.
[00:21:56.860 --> 00:21:57.860]   Never mind.
[00:21:57.860 --> 00:22:01.620]   Which is not to say that Apple Maps hasn't made incredible jumps in the past year alone.
[00:22:01.620 --> 00:22:05.820]   But before anybody is waving a flag, "You see, we brought the piece of Google Maps to
[00:22:05.820 --> 00:22:06.820]   its knees."
[00:22:06.820 --> 00:22:07.820]   Yeah.
[00:22:07.820 --> 00:22:08.820]   Like, "Oh, you have it.
[00:22:08.820 --> 00:22:12.620]   You just put a hamburger stand closer to someone's house than the really, really good
[00:22:12.620 --> 00:22:14.020]   restaurants that are off the highway."
[00:22:14.020 --> 00:22:15.020]   Yeah.
[00:22:15.020 --> 00:22:17.900]   You made it un-madening enough that people no longer just avoid it.
[00:22:17.900 --> 00:22:24.300]   You just -- all you had to do was turn it from a poke in the eye for this sharp stick to
[00:22:24.300 --> 00:22:26.180]   a poke in the eye with a blood stick.
[00:22:26.180 --> 00:22:27.820]   And that's all you need to do.
[00:22:27.820 --> 00:22:28.820]   I'm drunk.
[00:22:28.820 --> 00:22:29.820]   I'm using Apple Maps.
[00:22:29.820 --> 00:22:35.380]   Mr. Frederick, if you want to use that as this title slide for the next file means,
[00:22:35.380 --> 00:22:37.860]   "A poke in the eye with a blood stick."
[00:22:37.860 --> 00:22:40.140]   "One eye trauma."
[00:22:40.140 --> 00:22:42.140]   It's an improvement.
[00:22:42.140 --> 00:22:43.140]   Apple --
[00:22:43.140 --> 00:22:47.740]   I thought Apple Maps -- for me, it worked.
[00:22:47.740 --> 00:22:49.180]   From the very beginning.
[00:22:49.180 --> 00:22:58.900]   I mean, there was some funky map imagery and things like that.
[00:22:58.900 --> 00:23:02.460]   But actual maps worked pretty well for me right from the start.
[00:23:02.460 --> 00:23:04.820]   And it really depended where you are.
[00:23:04.820 --> 00:23:06.260]   Of course, you're in Silicon Valley.
[00:23:06.260 --> 00:23:07.500]   It's going to work really well.
[00:23:07.500 --> 00:23:11.380]   Two things for me is that it didn't have as good -- if I typed something in that was
[00:23:11.380 --> 00:23:13.860]   at all fuzzy, it couldn't resolve it the way Google Maps did.
[00:23:13.860 --> 00:23:19.060]   It couldn't do search widening and spelling mistakes and nearest neighbor as well as Google.
[00:23:19.060 --> 00:23:22.020]   And then last -- it could take me to the block where the thing is, but it wasn't as good
[00:23:22.020 --> 00:23:25.900]   at showing exactly where the entrance was and where it was in a structure.
[00:23:25.900 --> 00:23:27.820]   So it could get me most of the way there.
[00:23:27.820 --> 00:23:31.900]   But then at some point, Google, at least where I live, took out street names and we
[00:23:31.900 --> 00:23:35.500]   just took out exit numbers and we just give you street names.
[00:23:35.500 --> 00:23:39.460]   And it could be that's non-functional because every exit has like 19 different streets associated
[00:23:39.460 --> 00:23:40.940]   with it.
[00:23:40.940 --> 00:23:44.380]   So I went back to using Apple Maps and it's been good enough that I don't think it even
[00:23:44.380 --> 00:23:46.220]   downloaded Google Maps on Netflix.
[00:23:46.220 --> 00:23:47.220]   Really?
[00:23:47.220 --> 00:23:48.220]   Wow.
[00:23:48.220 --> 00:23:50.020]   I mean, they're all terrible.
[00:23:50.020 --> 00:23:51.260]   We were driving back from Ottawa.
[00:23:51.260 --> 00:23:54.300]   I mean, a friend of mine, I was using Apple Maps and he was using Google Maps.
[00:23:54.300 --> 00:23:56.980]   And neither of them knew when they were spontaneous construction.
[00:23:56.980 --> 00:24:01.500]   And Google told me to do a U-turn over a bridge and Apple Maps told me to go the wrong way.
[00:24:01.500 --> 00:24:05.620]   And it was just -- I'm just looking at this going, but we're in the future, fellas.
[00:24:05.620 --> 00:24:06.620]   Come on.
[00:24:06.620 --> 00:24:07.620]   Yeah.
[00:24:07.620 --> 00:24:08.620]   That's hard.
[00:24:08.620 --> 00:24:09.620]   You know, it's really hard to do what they're doing.
[00:24:09.620 --> 00:24:10.620]   It's very difficult.
[00:24:10.620 --> 00:24:13.340]   And things change fast.
[00:24:13.340 --> 00:24:17.620]   We -- you know, they've redone the whole Golden Gate Bridge approach in San Francisco.
[00:24:17.620 --> 00:24:21.140]   And I tried a couple of different maps to see who was up to date.
[00:24:21.140 --> 00:24:25.780]   And fortunately, it's funny, my car was most update because it uses Google Earth for its
[00:24:25.780 --> 00:24:27.940]   map input.
[00:24:27.940 --> 00:24:31.700]   And so it had actual pictures of the way it was supposed to look.
[00:24:31.700 --> 00:24:35.060]   But I've also gone off-roading on Google Maps.
[00:24:35.060 --> 00:24:37.060]   Yeah, that's -- that's -- that's -- that's fun.
[00:24:37.060 --> 00:24:41.180]   I didn't care about burning the bandwidth on my phone when I moved back down here because
[00:24:41.180 --> 00:24:45.940]   the exit off the highway to get here was like an exit that they just finished building
[00:24:45.940 --> 00:24:47.780]   like a year or something earlier.
[00:24:47.780 --> 00:24:52.300]   And I just enjoy just like plowing through trees and people's backyards on my phone.
[00:24:52.300 --> 00:24:53.300]   Yeah.
[00:24:53.300 --> 00:24:55.300]   I just -- I just enjoy that every single time I do it.
[00:24:55.300 --> 00:24:56.300]   So fun.
[00:24:56.300 --> 00:24:57.300]   I know how you --
[00:24:57.300 --> 00:24:58.300]   We're part of how helpless.
[00:24:58.300 --> 00:25:00.060]   Like, I was -- I was driving and I saw them closing a street.
[00:25:00.060 --> 00:25:02.540]   So, you know, fair enough, the maps app don't know it yet.
[00:25:02.540 --> 00:25:04.260]   But I had to not use that entrance.
[00:25:04.260 --> 00:25:07.020]   But then every single map app just wanted me to circle the block going back to that
[00:25:07.020 --> 00:25:08.020]   entrance over and over again.
[00:25:08.020 --> 00:25:09.020]   Yeah, that's a frustration.
[00:25:09.020 --> 00:25:10.020]   And I tried going further out.
[00:25:10.020 --> 00:25:11.020]   They want to -- and I was helpless.
[00:25:11.020 --> 00:25:12.020]   I had no idea where it was anymore.
[00:25:12.020 --> 00:25:15.060]   I've no -- I don't want to go under that anything but these maps apps.
[00:25:15.060 --> 00:25:16.060]   That's why you go to Waze.
[00:25:16.060 --> 00:25:19.020]   I mean, it's just spot on every single time.
[00:25:19.020 --> 00:25:20.020]   Because it's --
[00:25:20.020 --> 00:25:21.020]   It's crowdsourced, right?
[00:25:21.020 --> 00:25:22.020]   It's crowdsourced.
[00:25:22.020 --> 00:25:25.660]   But both immediately people saying, "Hey, I can't take that exit."
[00:25:25.660 --> 00:25:27.140]   Or there's a crash right here.
[00:25:27.140 --> 00:25:32.860]   And also people who, after working with the map creator app, they develop a reputation.
[00:25:32.860 --> 00:25:36.980]   The algorithm says, "If this person right here right now today is telling us that
[00:25:36.980 --> 00:25:40.380]   this exit is going to be closed for the next two weeks, let's assume that this exit is
[00:25:40.380 --> 00:25:42.060]   closed for the next two weeks."
[00:25:42.060 --> 00:25:44.820]   And so the updates just happened immediately.
[00:25:44.820 --> 00:25:48.500]   How is it -- what's the status of Apple Maps and public transport?
[00:25:48.500 --> 00:25:50.940]   They're slowly adding that, right?
[00:25:50.940 --> 00:25:53.180]   I don't think they've announced it in new cities though, have they?
[00:25:53.180 --> 00:25:54.180]   Not in a while.
[00:25:54.180 --> 00:25:55.980]   Yeah, it really is coming.
[00:25:55.980 --> 00:25:57.380]   Every single city has a big announcement.
[00:25:57.380 --> 00:26:00.220]   They just added Boston fairly recently.
[00:26:00.220 --> 00:26:03.860]   The directions are okay, but I expect it to get better.
[00:26:03.860 --> 00:26:08.420]   The thing to understand is that whenever you look at something like Google Maps, you're
[00:26:08.420 --> 00:26:11.580]   seeing 15 years' worth of experience.
[00:26:11.580 --> 00:26:15.780]   And a lot of that is just in observing how people are using the app and thinking, "Oh,
[00:26:15.780 --> 00:26:17.780]   we had no idea that people were going to use it this way.
[00:26:17.780 --> 00:26:19.500]   Let's make that easier."
[00:26:19.500 --> 00:26:25.660]   And so Apple shouldn't be dinged when the role of a new feature like a public transit,
[00:26:25.660 --> 00:26:29.140]   and it doesn't work quite as well as something that Google Maps does.
[00:26:29.140 --> 00:26:34.420]   Google Maps is usually pretty brilliant at figuring out that the easiest way to get there
[00:26:34.420 --> 00:26:37.340]   by public transit, there's also a third-party app.
[00:26:37.340 --> 00:26:41.180]   So we'll also include Uber in that and say, "What is it?
[00:26:41.180 --> 00:26:42.180]   CityMapper?"
[00:26:42.180 --> 00:26:46.180]   I shouldn't mention it, so I keep getting these two apps confused whenever I think about
[00:26:46.180 --> 00:26:47.180]   them.
[00:26:47.180 --> 00:26:50.700]   But there's one that's just so good, it'll say, "Well, here's how you would get it if
[00:26:50.700 --> 00:26:54.260]   you get a Zipcar, because there's a Zipcar lot just two blocks away from you right now.
[00:26:54.260 --> 00:26:57.540]   If you don't mind walking a half a mile, you can go here."
[00:26:57.540 --> 00:27:01.740]   It's one of these companies is going to get bought by somebody, and that's going to make
[00:27:01.740 --> 00:27:04.860]   it the default app for a lot of users.
[00:27:04.860 --> 00:27:10.060]   One of the issues, I think, is that city governments, in some cases, decided, "Oh, we're
[00:27:10.060 --> 00:27:14.020]   going to hold on to this information," information which frankly belongs to the public.
[00:27:14.020 --> 00:27:18.060]   We're going to hold on to this information and make money by licensing it or make our
[00:27:18.060 --> 00:27:20.500]   own app, and that's really--
[00:27:20.500 --> 00:27:25.540]   That's why China, there's 300 Chinese cities because they have a central authority that
[00:27:25.540 --> 00:27:28.900]   governs the usage of all of them in a central repository that has all the data in the same
[00:27:28.900 --> 00:27:29.900]   format.
[00:27:29.900 --> 00:27:31.140]   We're almost every other country.
[00:27:31.140 --> 00:27:35.700]   It's every single municipal Fyptom has their own ownership of it and format for it and
[00:27:35.700 --> 00:27:38.220]   way that they will and will not let it be used.
[00:27:38.220 --> 00:27:39.220]   That's a shame.
[00:27:39.220 --> 00:27:42.580]   Yeah, I think it's city map that really does a great job.
[00:27:42.580 --> 00:27:44.460]   I use that in London.
[00:27:44.460 --> 00:27:46.340]   As you say, it's fantastic.
[00:27:46.340 --> 00:27:50.260]   It'll tell you how to get anywhere four different ways.
[00:27:50.260 --> 00:27:54.660]   Yeah, I'm amazed at how-- Some of this seems so simple too.
[00:27:54.660 --> 00:27:58.940]   All I want is whenever I go into the city, I'm always starting from this commuter rail
[00:27:58.940 --> 00:27:59.940]   station.
[00:27:59.940 --> 00:28:01.940]   I'm always getting off at Back Bay station.
[00:28:01.940 --> 00:28:07.620]   I just need this app to say, "Okay, if he's not within 20 miles of Back Bay station, I
[00:28:07.620 --> 00:28:08.620]   bet he's home."
[00:28:08.620 --> 00:28:11.900]   So I'm going to tell him-- Any time he taps his butt, I'm going to tell him when the next
[00:28:11.900 --> 00:28:13.380]   train to Back Bay is.
[00:28:13.380 --> 00:28:16.500]   Any time I'm in the city, "Oh, well, he's not close to home, I'm going to tell him when
[00:28:16.500 --> 00:28:18.340]   the next train home is."
[00:28:18.340 --> 00:28:22.340]   It seems to me like an obvious thing, but people who look at millions of commuters instead
[00:28:22.340 --> 00:28:24.580]   of just me have a different attitude about it.
[00:28:24.580 --> 00:28:30.340]   I'm still angry that the MBTA commuter rail app, every single time I have to punch in the
[00:28:30.340 --> 00:28:32.740]   name of the station and then tell it it's a weekday.
[00:28:32.740 --> 00:28:34.500]   Then he has to want to go inbound.
[00:28:34.500 --> 00:28:38.740]   And every single time I'm thinking, "There are sensors on this computer.
[00:28:38.740 --> 00:28:40.300]   This isn't a PDF.
[00:28:40.300 --> 00:28:41.820]   You should get to figure this out."
[00:28:41.820 --> 00:28:42.820]   That really is.
[00:28:42.820 --> 00:28:45.700]   Do you use-- So, Jim, as much as you like Apple Maps, you'll use something like City
[00:28:45.700 --> 00:28:48.460]   Mapper if you're somewhere.
[00:28:48.460 --> 00:28:53.580]   If I'm somewhere like an England and things like that, yeah.
[00:28:53.580 --> 00:28:58.660]   But the majority of the time, I'll tell you, I use Apple Maps.
[00:28:58.660 --> 00:29:00.020]   It's there.
[00:29:00.020 --> 00:29:02.620]   I find it very accurate.
[00:29:02.620 --> 00:29:04.180]   And it gives me good directions.
[00:29:04.180 --> 00:29:10.900]   And usually, depending on where you go in, it'll give you two or three different routes.
[00:29:10.900 --> 00:29:13.980]   And you pick the one that's best and away you go.
[00:29:13.980 --> 00:29:16.780]   I do like its integration into the watch, too.
[00:29:16.780 --> 00:29:18.420]   Does Google Maps do that?
[00:29:18.420 --> 00:29:20.420]   I can't-- on the watch.
[00:29:20.420 --> 00:29:23.060]   It's the alerts, but it's not the same level.
[00:29:23.060 --> 00:29:26.460]   It's not-- So, you see that it buzzes you and it says turn left.
[00:29:26.460 --> 00:29:27.460]   I mean, it's really nice.
[00:29:27.460 --> 00:29:30.580]   It's really good with the Maps app, not just with notifications.
[00:29:30.580 --> 00:29:31.580]   Yeah.
[00:29:31.580 --> 00:29:33.940]   But that's where Apple kind of excels at things.
[00:29:33.940 --> 00:29:40.300]   Is that level of integration where you can do things from your watch or from your phone.
[00:29:40.300 --> 00:29:44.460]   And it kind of integrates back and forth between the two.
[00:29:44.460 --> 00:29:45.460]   That's really great.
[00:29:45.460 --> 00:29:50.340]   Actually, I do want to talk about in a little bit the above Avalon post-dance post about
[00:29:50.340 --> 00:29:52.260]   the grand unified theory of Apple products.
[00:29:52.260 --> 00:29:53.780]   Because that links into this.
[00:29:53.780 --> 00:29:55.020]   And I'm sure you guys have an opinion.
[00:29:55.020 --> 00:29:58.620]   We talked on Sunday about it on Twit with Jason Snow.
[00:29:58.620 --> 00:29:59.620]   And I'm just curious.
[00:29:59.620 --> 00:30:00.620]   I'm sure you've read it.
[00:30:00.620 --> 00:30:05.300]   But as long as we're talking about the watch, is Mark Gurman right?
[00:30:05.300 --> 00:30:08.900]   A simple yep or nope will do.
[00:30:08.900 --> 00:30:10.220]   Apple plans Mark.
[00:30:10.220 --> 00:30:18.540]   Mark Apple watch two events with a possibility of four inch iPhone 6C.
[00:30:18.540 --> 00:30:19.540]   And Max.
[00:30:19.540 --> 00:30:20.540]   And Max?
[00:30:20.540 --> 00:30:22.580]   Did you mention Max too?
[00:30:22.580 --> 00:30:24.180]   Wow.
[00:30:24.180 --> 00:30:25.580]   Would this be?
[00:30:25.580 --> 00:30:26.580]   Is this be?
[00:30:26.580 --> 00:30:27.580]   Could this be?
[00:30:27.580 --> 00:30:32.540]   It was at last year's March event that Apple announced my favorite Mac today, which is the
[00:30:32.540 --> 00:30:34.380]   Mac book, that 12 inch MacBook.
[00:30:34.380 --> 00:30:35.380]   Yeah.
[00:30:35.380 --> 00:30:36.380]   Mine too.
[00:30:36.380 --> 00:30:37.380]   Love that.
[00:30:37.380 --> 00:30:40.180]   I think we're going to put a second port on that thing.
[00:30:40.180 --> 00:30:41.940]   You don't need a second port.
[00:30:41.940 --> 00:30:43.180]   Type C is everything you need.
[00:30:43.180 --> 00:30:44.740]   It'd be nice to have.
[00:30:44.740 --> 00:30:46.700]   We don't need it.
[00:30:46.700 --> 00:30:47.700]   I don't need it.
[00:30:47.700 --> 00:30:52.020]   I mean, the MacBook is my favorite Mac.
[00:30:52.020 --> 00:30:53.300]   I thought I would need it.
[00:30:53.300 --> 00:30:55.300]   And then you realize I never connect anything.
[00:30:55.300 --> 00:30:56.540]   If I do, I get a dongle.
[00:30:56.540 --> 00:30:59.460]   But yeah, I do it so rarely that.
[00:30:59.460 --> 00:31:01.540]   I never need a second port.
[00:31:01.540 --> 00:31:03.220]   What I do need is a much more powerful processor.
[00:31:03.220 --> 00:31:05.220]   So I go back to the Mac Pro for that kind of stuff.
[00:31:05.220 --> 00:31:06.620]   Well, maybe that's what we'll see in March.
[00:31:07.620 --> 00:31:11.540]   Because the Intel Broadwell Dash Y, it still makes me cry sometimes.
[00:31:11.540 --> 00:31:15.700]   Is there a sky like a suitable sky like part from Intel that would make the MacBook sing?
[00:31:15.700 --> 00:31:17.580]   I think they have an analog to the Broadwell.
[00:31:17.580 --> 00:31:18.580]   It's what do they call it?
[00:31:18.580 --> 00:31:19.580]   Core M, I think is a product.
[00:31:19.580 --> 00:31:20.580]   Yeah.
[00:31:20.580 --> 00:31:21.580]   Core M.
[00:31:21.580 --> 00:31:22.580]   Yeah.
[00:31:22.580 --> 00:31:23.580]   So there'll be a sky like one.
[00:31:23.580 --> 00:31:24.580]   But I mean, it's a hard job there.
[00:31:24.580 --> 00:31:29.980]   As much as Apple is trying to bring the A8, the A9X up to sort of iPad Pro power levels,
[00:31:29.980 --> 00:31:35.060]   Intel's trying to push the laptop things down to ultimate portable levels.
[00:31:35.060 --> 00:31:36.940]   And both those things are really hard to do.
[00:31:36.940 --> 00:31:37.940]   Yep.
[00:31:37.940 --> 00:31:43.260]   Skylake for laptops has a faster core M with faster RAM.
[00:31:43.260 --> 00:31:47.580]   I think that would be March would be an excellent time to announce that Apple.
[00:31:47.580 --> 00:31:48.580]   Yeah.
[00:31:48.580 --> 00:31:49.580]   I'd like to have to.
[00:31:49.580 --> 00:31:51.060]   But what's now the Apple Watch 2?
[00:31:51.060 --> 00:31:52.260]   What about that?
[00:31:52.260 --> 00:31:54.700]   Is that credible?
[00:31:54.700 --> 00:31:58.500]   No, I mean, they have.
[00:31:58.500 --> 00:32:01.180]   Are they done as a gelled yet?
[00:32:01.180 --> 00:32:02.700]   Are they done too soon, Apple?
[00:32:02.700 --> 00:32:04.140]   I'm just going to say it right now.
[00:32:04.140 --> 00:32:05.940]   I don't know if it's too soon.
[00:32:05.940 --> 00:32:10.220]   They have to really come up with something dynamic in how it tracks health.
[00:32:10.220 --> 00:32:13.980]   So if they came up with a really good sensor, if they had came up with a way to improve
[00:32:13.980 --> 00:32:18.780]   the hardware so that it could do blood pressure readings without making the watch band into
[00:32:18.780 --> 00:32:22.340]   an inflatable cup, that would be absolutely amazing.
[00:32:22.340 --> 00:32:23.340]   You're right.
[00:32:23.340 --> 00:32:26.420]   It's hard to think of what you could do to make this version.
[00:32:26.420 --> 00:32:30.140]   An S2 computer on a chip, I think, would be nice just because they're still like the
[00:32:30.140 --> 00:32:31.500]   app story is still really hard.
[00:32:31.500 --> 00:32:35.100]   I think even Apple doesn't really know what apps on a watch means yet, let alone developers.
[00:32:35.100 --> 00:32:38.460]   Well, you're right with the S2, I thought apps are going to just pop up and they still
[00:32:38.460 --> 00:32:39.460]   go spin.
[00:32:39.460 --> 00:32:40.660]   No, it's still hugely resourced.
[00:32:40.660 --> 00:32:44.900]   It's hugely power and performance constrained because it's a tiny, tiny little thing.
[00:32:44.900 --> 00:32:46.940]   And looking at this, I mean, people say Apple just wants thinness.
[00:32:46.940 --> 00:32:49.300]   They're willing to go thick if they need to to fit stuff into it.
[00:32:49.300 --> 00:32:54.100]   I mean, that thing is just chock full of processor and battery as much as they could spare
[00:32:54.100 --> 00:32:55.100]   and it's not enough.
[00:32:55.100 --> 00:32:58.500]   And maybe an S2 computer on a chip would improve performance.
[00:32:58.500 --> 00:33:03.100]   I'd rather see just, there's a lot of ideas in the original watch that is a communications
[00:33:03.100 --> 00:33:04.100]   thing.
[00:33:04.100 --> 00:33:05.100]   I don't get those anymore.
[00:33:05.100 --> 00:33:06.100]   I like the sketches.
[00:33:06.100 --> 00:33:07.340]   I never get them anymore.
[00:33:07.340 --> 00:33:10.140]   So is that really what people want to do on their watch?
[00:33:10.140 --> 00:33:12.900]   Are the apps the way they are now, the analog to iPhone apps?
[00:33:12.900 --> 00:33:14.220]   Is that really what people want to do?
[00:33:14.220 --> 00:33:17.580]   So I could see better hardware because Apple can always make better hardware.
[00:33:17.580 --> 00:33:19.700]   The March of technology always goes forward.
[00:33:19.700 --> 00:33:22.820]   They always have better chipsets, always have slightly better tricks to get more out of
[00:33:22.820 --> 00:33:25.620]   battery life as long as I can keep using my bands.
[00:33:25.620 --> 00:33:28.660]   I think honestly the bands and I'll have a bigger investment in those and the stupid
[00:33:28.660 --> 00:33:29.660]   case.
[00:33:29.660 --> 00:33:30.660]   So I'd be happy to just stop.
[00:33:30.660 --> 00:33:31.660]   That's a good point.
[00:33:31.660 --> 00:33:32.660]   You don't care.
[00:33:32.660 --> 00:33:33.660]   You're Mr. Band Man.
[00:33:33.660 --> 00:33:36.020]   Well, I mean, that would be harder if I had to re-buy those bands.
[00:33:36.020 --> 00:33:37.020]   Ouch.
[00:33:37.020 --> 00:33:40.540]   If I could just get a new case and use it with those bands, that greatly lowers the impact
[00:33:40.540 --> 00:33:41.540]   on me.
[00:33:41.540 --> 00:33:42.540]   So I could absolutely see that.
[00:33:42.540 --> 00:33:47.220]   But watch OS3, I think to me is a much bigger question than watch hardware too.
[00:33:47.220 --> 00:33:53.860]   Well, and I think we need to really decide what it is we want the watch to do.
[00:33:53.860 --> 00:33:56.660]   And I don't think a lot of people really know that yet.
[00:33:56.660 --> 00:34:04.820]   For me, the watch works well as it is because I use it for fitness tracking and directions
[00:34:04.820 --> 00:34:05.820]   and music.
[00:34:05.820 --> 00:34:08.980]   I use Siri a lot on my watch.
[00:34:08.980 --> 00:34:10.980]   And to me, that works really well.
[00:34:10.980 --> 00:34:16.900]   I don't know if I would really use full fledged apps on my watch.
[00:34:16.900 --> 00:34:21.820]   I don't even use glances that much to be honest.
[00:34:21.820 --> 00:34:31.500]   So there's a lot of things that I do on my watch and the way that it integrates with
[00:34:31.500 --> 00:34:34.740]   the iPhone is perfectly fine with me.
[00:34:34.740 --> 00:34:42.020]   I haven't seen or heard of a killer app that would make me say, "Okay, this is going to
[00:34:42.020 --> 00:34:48.900]   be so great that it can be a full app on its own."
[00:34:48.900 --> 00:34:50.820]   Excel, just like the LEDs in Mac.
[00:34:50.820 --> 00:34:56.580]   I'm looking more forward to watch OS3.
[00:34:56.580 --> 00:35:01.260]   And I'm looking forward to seeing Apple was in a real jam with the first -- I'm not
[00:35:01.260 --> 00:35:02.460]   a jam, I'm sorry.
[00:35:02.460 --> 00:35:06.780]   They didn't have the same opportunities they had with the watch that they had with the
[00:35:06.780 --> 00:35:08.660]   iPad and with notebooks and with the phones.
[00:35:08.660 --> 00:35:12.620]   They don't have the ability to observe other people who had made even successful products
[00:35:12.620 --> 00:35:14.980]   and seeing, "Well, here's how people are using these things.
[00:35:14.980 --> 00:35:18.020]   Here's the things they're complaining about this, the BlackBerry phone.
[00:35:18.020 --> 00:35:19.020]   Here's things that we can fix.
[00:35:19.020 --> 00:35:20.860]   And here's how we can carve out our own space."
[00:35:20.860 --> 00:35:24.980]   They really had to say, "No, there is no such example of a really successful smart watch
[00:35:24.980 --> 00:35:27.700]   before, so it's down to what do we think should work."
[00:35:27.700 --> 00:35:31.500]   And I think that leads to a design where they have to put out a lot of ideas that they
[00:35:31.500 --> 00:35:35.780]   personally believe in very strongly, but they're not going to know whether people are taking
[00:35:35.780 --> 00:35:37.980]   them up until they get information back.
[00:35:37.980 --> 00:35:40.140]   They watch people and see what people are using.
[00:35:40.140 --> 00:35:43.820]   Just like Renee said, I can't remember the last time that I even heard of somebody sending
[00:35:43.820 --> 00:35:44.820]   sketches.
[00:35:44.820 --> 00:35:49.220]   The send your heartbeat thing is a very beautiful demo and it doesn't get in the way if you
[00:35:49.220 --> 00:35:52.060]   don't use it, but I don't see people using that.
[00:35:52.060 --> 00:35:54.700]   Glimps has never really worked for me very well.
[00:35:54.700 --> 00:35:58.140]   I don't know what the glimpse is and the glimpse is never there when I need it.
[00:35:58.140 --> 00:35:59.140]   I've switched back.
[00:35:59.140 --> 00:36:05.340]   Now that my sim is in my Nexus 5, so now I'm back to using Android for full time.
[00:36:05.340 --> 00:36:10.100]   And I'm just remembering over the past just four days that isn't it great when you just
[00:36:10.100 --> 00:36:14.340]   turn your wrist and there's the information that you want right now that you can turn
[00:36:14.340 --> 00:36:16.220]   your watch to get right there.
[00:36:16.220 --> 00:36:18.620]   I had a meeting at 3 p.m. yesterday.
[00:36:18.620 --> 00:36:20.140]   That's why I was in town.
[00:36:20.140 --> 00:36:23.300]   And half hour before the meeting, I'm saying, well, I should probably start walking there
[00:36:23.300 --> 00:36:25.100]   and think about five blocks away.
[00:36:25.100 --> 00:36:29.840]   And literally as I turn my watch, I'm about to do a Google search or whatever.
[00:36:29.840 --> 00:36:34.780]   As soon as I turn my watch, a new card arrived with, here's your appointment is 30 minutes
[00:36:34.780 --> 00:36:35.780]   away.
[00:36:35.780 --> 00:36:38.620]   Here is the address, tap this button to get onto Google Maps.
[00:36:38.620 --> 00:36:40.540]   And I'm like, that's all I want.
[00:36:40.540 --> 00:36:42.260]   But think ahead for me.
[00:36:42.260 --> 00:36:45.260]   And I'm not suggesting that that's exactly the way all watches should do it.
[00:36:45.260 --> 00:36:47.700]   But it's an example of one successful way to do it.
[00:36:47.700 --> 00:36:53.460]   And I think that Apple's going to be refining their view of who's using it and what's really
[00:36:53.460 --> 00:36:55.140]   speaking to them about the watch.
[00:36:55.140 --> 00:36:57.660]   I get that from like, I made a dinner reservation the other day.
[00:36:57.660 --> 00:37:01.380]   And all of a sudden in both the series search page and my watch, a thing came up saying,
[00:37:01.380 --> 00:37:03.180]   traffic is dense, leave earlier.
[00:37:03.180 --> 00:37:06.380]   It's just, I don't get them consistently the way that I get the way that they work on
[00:37:06.380 --> 00:37:07.380]   Google now.
[00:37:07.380 --> 00:37:08.380]   And I don't know what was causing that.
[00:37:08.380 --> 00:37:09.380]   But that stuff is all there.
[00:37:09.380 --> 00:37:11.100]   It just needs to be acted on better, I think.
[00:37:11.100 --> 00:37:16.660]   I'm kind of worried, although I guess there's a benefit to it, that we're really rapidly
[00:37:16.660 --> 00:37:19.980]   entering a world where you pick a side.
[00:37:19.980 --> 00:37:22.860]   If you're Google, you have to be all Google.
[00:37:22.860 --> 00:37:26.980]   And you'll have a Pixel C, you'll have an Android Wear watch, you'll have a Nexus,
[00:37:26.980 --> 00:37:30.940]   you'll have, I don't know if you'll have a Chromebook, but everything else will be Google.
[00:37:30.940 --> 00:37:34.580]   If you're Apple, it's just really, you're not going to use it.
[00:37:34.580 --> 00:37:36.100]   You can't use Android Wear Wear Wear Wear Wear.
[00:37:36.100 --> 00:37:37.100]   I mean, you can use it.
[00:37:37.100 --> 00:37:38.100]   And not very well.
[00:37:38.100 --> 00:37:40.660]   You just, you're going to pick a side now.
[00:37:40.660 --> 00:37:41.660]   And I, you've got to pick a side now.
[00:37:41.660 --> 00:37:42.660]   You've got to pick a side.
[00:37:42.660 --> 00:37:43.660]   You've got to pick a side.
[00:37:43.660 --> 00:37:47.820]   It's gotten less and less cooperative.
[00:37:47.820 --> 00:37:52.180]   And I see Google kind of, I feel like Google's now more and more a second class citizen on
[00:37:52.180 --> 00:37:54.940]   iOS.
[00:37:54.940 --> 00:37:57.540]   Not to go in a tangent, but can you imagine a world where Google decided they didn't
[00:37:57.540 --> 00:38:00.900]   need to compete in smartphones and they just concentrated fully on making that Star Trek
[00:38:00.900 --> 00:38:03.780]   system in the cloud and for every device.
[00:38:03.780 --> 00:38:09.740]   And there was just fabulous, incredible Google services on Windows and on iOS and no competing
[00:38:09.740 --> 00:38:10.740]   hardware devices.
[00:38:10.740 --> 00:38:12.180]   That would be a fascinating world to live in.
[00:38:12.180 --> 00:38:13.180]   Yeah.
[00:38:13.180 --> 00:38:14.340]   Are you doing that now?
[00:38:14.340 --> 00:38:19.020]   The only really weird thing they're doing is shutting out Windows Phone, which I still
[00:38:19.020 --> 00:38:21.220]   don't know exactly.
[00:38:21.220 --> 00:38:25.460]   It seems as though if they were really committed to all of our software everywhere, we don't
[00:38:25.460 --> 00:38:28.580]   care where you're doing it, it would say, yeah, you're going to have to start writing
[00:38:28.580 --> 00:38:30.140]   some Windows Phone apps.
[00:38:30.140 --> 00:38:33.740]   The only company that's really cross platform at this point, ironically, is Michael.
[00:38:33.740 --> 00:38:34.740]   Microsoft.
[00:38:34.740 --> 00:38:35.740]   Yeah.
[00:38:35.740 --> 00:38:36.740]   Yeah.
[00:38:36.740 --> 00:38:37.740]   They're even non Microsoft.
[00:38:37.740 --> 00:38:38.740]   Yeah.
[00:38:38.740 --> 00:38:43.020]   Well, that's, you know, it's, you never talk about you.
[00:38:43.020 --> 00:38:45.980]   It's bad to talk about companies as though they're people and that they're doing things
[00:38:45.980 --> 00:38:49.940]   for the good of this or because they're fascinated by that necessarily.
[00:38:49.940 --> 00:38:53.420]   They run the, they run the business that they're capable of running and Microsoft realized
[00:38:53.420 --> 00:38:58.460]   that now that there's so much diversity and now that the mobile has taken over, they can't
[00:38:58.460 --> 00:39:02.940]   get by on selling desktop operating systems and desktop based software anymore.
[00:39:02.940 --> 00:39:03.940]   So now they're shifting in three.
[00:39:03.940 --> 00:39:07.060]   So why that they make the best cross platform.
[00:39:07.060 --> 00:39:11.900]   I can't think of a better cross platform app right now than Office, the entire suite
[00:39:11.900 --> 00:39:12.900]   from edge to edge.
[00:39:12.900 --> 00:39:15.500]   And the reason why they're doing that is because that's the business that they feel
[00:39:15.500 --> 00:39:18.820]   as though they have to be in just like Google is in the business they have to be in, which
[00:39:18.820 --> 00:39:22.580]   is a web based service that will deploy pretty much everywhere and apples in the business
[00:39:22.580 --> 00:39:28.180]   they are in, which is to justify really well made, really fine crafted, really expensive
[00:39:28.180 --> 00:39:29.180]   pieces of hardware.
[00:39:29.180 --> 00:39:32.540]   You can't imagine how painful it was for me.
[00:39:32.540 --> 00:39:39.980]   And people have been asking me, what now that Dropbox is killing mailbox, what do you recommend
[00:39:39.980 --> 00:39:44.140]   as an alternative in iOS and I say, Mike, believe it or not, Microsoft Outlook.
[00:39:44.140 --> 00:39:49.460]   I switched to an exchange server and I'm really happy with it.
[00:39:49.460 --> 00:39:50.460]   Months ago, really?
[00:39:50.460 --> 00:39:52.660]   You use an exchange server?
[00:39:52.660 --> 00:39:54.900]   Because I was on, you need to do an audit.
[00:39:54.900 --> 00:39:56.860]   You use like a third party.
[00:39:56.860 --> 00:39:57.860]   Who do you use?
[00:39:57.860 --> 00:40:00.220]   I subscribe to Office 365 exchange mail.
[00:40:00.220 --> 00:40:02.100]   I use $8 for my mailbox.
[00:40:02.100 --> 00:40:03.100]   And it's trusted.
[00:40:03.100 --> 00:40:06.660]   And the apps are all free and they're really wonderful apps.
[00:40:06.660 --> 00:40:08.700]   I feel as though they're much better than the mail.
[00:40:08.700 --> 00:40:14.020]   I have not even configured the mail app on my iPad Pro because the Outlook app is just
[00:40:14.020 --> 00:40:18.540]   so much better than what I've been experiencing in other apps.
[00:40:18.540 --> 00:40:22.100]   Backups support, it hooks up to everything else really, really well.
[00:40:22.100 --> 00:40:26.620]   I mean, the reason why I didn't even think about switching my mail to exchange was that
[00:40:26.620 --> 00:40:27.620]   I'm a fish.
[00:40:27.620 --> 00:40:28.820]   Well, I'm not a business.
[00:40:28.820 --> 00:40:33.300]   I'm not a, and it must be, I don't, I can't pay $100 a seat per month or whatever.
[00:40:33.300 --> 00:40:34.300]   But no, it's eight bucks.
[00:40:34.300 --> 00:40:35.300]   Wait a minute.
[00:40:35.300 --> 00:40:36.900]   I didn't even know about this.
[00:40:36.900 --> 00:40:37.900]   So okay.
[00:40:37.900 --> 00:40:38.900]   Go to Office 365.
[00:40:38.900 --> 00:40:40.820]   I'm an Office 365 subscriber.
[00:40:40.820 --> 00:40:42.140]   So I can add free bucks a month.
[00:40:42.140 --> 00:40:44.380]   I can add email basically.
[00:40:44.380 --> 00:40:46.380]   You get to get an Outlook address?
[00:40:46.380 --> 00:40:50.660]   You can get, no, you can attach your own domain to it.
[00:40:50.660 --> 00:40:54.620]   It's a separate thing from a regular Office 365 subscription, I believe.
[00:40:54.620 --> 00:40:56.700]   It will integrate into your Office 365.
[00:40:56.700 --> 00:41:02.260]   But it isn't, it is, I don't know what the sales domain is, but I think it's something
[00:41:02.260 --> 00:41:04.740]   like exchange.com.
[00:41:04.740 --> 00:41:10.940]   And I was on the same email provider for about 12 years, and they were charging me $12 a
[00:41:10.940 --> 00:41:15.060]   month for like a limited like one gigabyte of storage and a whole bunch of stuff that
[00:41:15.060 --> 00:41:16.060]   didn't really work.
[00:41:16.060 --> 00:41:19.980]   And now for less money than that, I've got something that is up all the time.
[00:41:19.980 --> 00:41:23.420]   And I don't have to keep cleaning up my mailbox every two weeks and all this other sort of
[00:41:23.420 --> 00:41:24.420]   thing.
[00:41:24.420 --> 00:41:25.420]   And all this great free software.
[00:41:25.420 --> 00:41:26.700]   So I'm pretty glad.
[00:41:26.700 --> 00:41:32.780]   I think Microsoft has done an incredible job on their iPhone on iPad.
[00:41:32.780 --> 00:41:33.780]   Absolutely.
[00:41:33.780 --> 00:41:34.780]   For Office.
[00:41:34.780 --> 00:41:38.020]   Just they've done a tremendous job on those apps.
[00:41:38.020 --> 00:41:47.060]   But I tried Outlook a little while ago, maybe four or five months ago, on the Mac.
[00:41:47.060 --> 00:41:49.260]   And I just thought it was awful.
[00:41:49.260 --> 00:41:51.900]   Oh no, I said, no, the desktop app is terrible.
[00:41:51.900 --> 00:41:52.900]   No, the desktop.
[00:41:52.900 --> 00:41:54.900]   Everybody knows that.
[00:41:54.900 --> 00:41:58.060]   I don't think Andy's recommending Outlook for Mac.
[00:41:58.060 --> 00:41:59.060]   It's great.
[00:41:59.060 --> 00:42:00.900]   I've been using the web app.
[00:42:00.900 --> 00:42:02.260]   Oh yeah, OK.
[00:42:02.260 --> 00:42:03.260]   All right.
[00:42:03.260 --> 00:42:06.980]   And you can use mail, Apple's mail with mail.
[00:42:06.980 --> 00:42:11.340]   Yep, mail contacts, everything has a exchange support.
[00:42:11.340 --> 00:42:16.100]   So you just even if you just want to use it as a mail provider and still use all of your
[00:42:16.100 --> 00:42:19.380]   standard like stock Apple apps, it will work just fine.
[00:42:19.380 --> 00:42:20.380]   One thing for me.
[00:42:20.380 --> 00:42:21.940]   What happened to the Mac?
[00:42:21.940 --> 00:42:23.340]   What happened to the Mac apps?
[00:42:23.340 --> 00:42:24.340]   Why are they so bad?
[00:42:24.340 --> 00:42:26.660]   You're still tied to the old office, I think.
[00:42:26.660 --> 00:42:28.620]   Outlook was a horrific program.
[00:42:28.620 --> 00:42:31.940]   It's revenge for iTunes on Windows.
[00:42:31.940 --> 00:42:34.900]   That's what's confusing because Outlook for iOS is not Outlook.
[00:42:34.900 --> 00:42:35.900]   It's a complete.
[00:42:35.900 --> 00:42:36.900]   It's a complete.
[00:42:36.900 --> 00:42:37.900]   Absolutely.
[00:42:37.900 --> 00:42:42.460]   The thing that I like about this too is to Andy's point, a friend of mine was all upset
[00:42:42.460 --> 00:42:43.700]   that mailbox is going away.
[00:42:43.700 --> 00:42:46.660]   And to me, I will never use an app that has not core to a company's business because I
[00:42:46.660 --> 00:42:50.020]   don't ever want to care about an app that I'm using more than the company that makes it.
[00:42:50.020 --> 00:42:52.220]   But it was a great app and then Dropbox bought it.
[00:42:52.220 --> 00:42:53.220]   I mean, that's the thing.
[00:42:53.220 --> 00:42:54.220]   I mean, did you wait?
[00:42:54.220 --> 00:42:55.220]   Absolutely.
[00:42:55.220 --> 00:42:56.700]   But I want to go to Microsoft because they care desperately.
[00:42:56.700 --> 00:42:57.940]   It's like, I don't really use inboxes.
[00:42:57.940 --> 00:43:00.620]   I feel like if I want to use Gmail, I use Gmail.
[00:43:00.620 --> 00:43:01.620]   I don't use inboxes.
[00:43:01.620 --> 00:43:04.660]   I feel like that's something kind of the thing that Google will just take away one day.
[00:43:04.660 --> 00:43:06.140]   And then I'll be all upset about it.
[00:43:06.140 --> 00:43:08.980]   So I'd rather just use a company that's focused on making that product awesome.
[00:43:08.980 --> 00:43:10.620]   And that's their primary business.
[00:43:10.620 --> 00:43:12.500]   And I think Outlook is like that in Gmail.
[00:43:12.500 --> 00:43:16.540]   So I'm sorry, I keep going back to this.
[00:43:16.540 --> 00:43:21.220]   So Andy, I already have an Office 365 subscription.
[00:43:21.220 --> 00:43:23.580]   And then now I have home.
[00:43:23.580 --> 00:43:24.580]   I don't have business.
[00:43:24.580 --> 00:43:25.580]   Do I need business?
[00:43:25.580 --> 00:43:29.220]   Because I could just-- I mean, I have an Outlook address.
[00:43:29.220 --> 00:43:31.020]   Try going to Outlook.com.
[00:43:31.020 --> 00:43:36.580]   I think that that's-- it confused me as well because there's Office 365 and then there's
[00:43:36.580 --> 00:43:37.580]   Outlook.com.
[00:43:37.580 --> 00:43:38.580]   Right.
[00:43:38.580 --> 00:43:42.420]   Outlook.com is their mail program, which I do have an account.
[00:43:42.420 --> 00:43:45.100]   I mean, this is-- I have an address there.
[00:43:45.100 --> 00:43:48.980]   As you can see, it's basically filled with Microsoft spam.
[00:43:48.980 --> 00:43:54.020]   That's just the free email address that you do with whatever you do.
[00:43:54.020 --> 00:43:56.380]   This is actually hosted exchange.
[00:43:56.380 --> 00:43:58.420]   I got to check that out.
[00:43:58.420 --> 00:43:59.420]   You know what?
[00:43:59.420 --> 00:44:02.180]   I'll just ask Paul Thorett and Mary Jo Foley tomorrow and this week.
[00:44:02.180 --> 00:44:06.620]   Yeah, it was between-- I can't remember the other one, but there's another really nicely--
[00:44:06.620 --> 00:44:08.460]   I wish-- I'm sorry, they can't come up.
[00:44:08.460 --> 00:44:10.020]   I'd have to open up my Evernote.
[00:44:10.020 --> 00:44:13.940]   But there's another super, super popular third party mail hosting system that's been
[00:44:13.940 --> 00:44:15.500]   around for years and years and years.
[00:44:15.500 --> 00:44:17.180]   I've been using fast mail and IMAP.
[00:44:17.180 --> 00:44:19.180]   I think it was fast mail.
[00:44:19.180 --> 00:44:20.500]   Yeah, I love fast mail.
[00:44:20.500 --> 00:44:22.900]   It was really a coin toss.
[00:44:22.900 --> 00:44:24.420]   And the thing that-- I could have gone either way.
[00:44:24.420 --> 00:44:25.420]   I went flip the coin.
[00:44:25.420 --> 00:44:26.660]   It was number one.
[00:44:26.660 --> 00:44:31.060]   I'd never used Exchange before and I thought it would be a good learning experience for
[00:44:31.060 --> 00:44:33.140]   people because I have no experience with it.
[00:44:33.140 --> 00:44:39.580]   And also, one of the most intense email users that I know is my friend Dave Nadian, who
[00:44:39.580 --> 00:44:43.180]   does SuperDuber, the backup utility.
[00:44:43.180 --> 00:44:47.460]   And he gets-- he does all of his customer service emails personally.
[00:44:47.460 --> 00:44:51.940]   And it's always people who are saying, I downloaded your free app and I can't figure
[00:44:51.940 --> 00:44:54.220]   out how to back up my thing.
[00:44:54.220 --> 00:44:58.540]   And he's been on vacation and keeping up with hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of
[00:44:58.540 --> 00:44:59.540]   emails a day.
[00:44:59.540 --> 00:45:02.540]   And he uses Exchange as his hosted mail service.
[00:45:02.540 --> 00:45:07.940]   And I thought, well, he's not only a consistent email wherever he is, but if him having to
[00:45:07.940 --> 00:45:13.660]   process intensely that volume of email every day and he's happy with Exchange, I'm going
[00:45:13.660 --> 00:45:16.380]   to at least give it a try and I've been very happy with it.
[00:45:16.380 --> 00:45:17.900]   I'm going to try it.
[00:45:17.900 --> 00:45:18.900]   I just found it.
[00:45:18.900 --> 00:45:23.660]   So it's a little bit-- thanks to the chat room.
[00:45:23.660 --> 00:45:25.420]   It is a business product.
[00:45:25.420 --> 00:45:28.940]   It's $4 per user per month Exchange Online.
[00:45:28.940 --> 00:45:30.420]   So it's basically hosted email.
[00:45:30.420 --> 00:45:32.780]   For a buck, I got ripped off.
[00:45:32.780 --> 00:45:34.740]   I think I might have added a picture.
[00:45:34.740 --> 00:45:35.740]   I must have two addresses.
[00:45:35.740 --> 00:45:36.740]   Yeah.
[00:45:36.740 --> 00:45:38.340]   No, I don't want to talk to Microsoft.
[00:45:38.340 --> 00:45:39.340]   It's special.
[00:45:39.340 --> 00:45:45.500]   It's kind of sad, though, that there's stupid game services and movie services that I pay
[00:45:45.500 --> 00:45:51.060]   more for a month than the backbone of my entire business, which is my inbox.
[00:45:51.060 --> 00:45:54.940]   Well, I'm mostly looking for just a better way to handle email.
[00:45:54.940 --> 00:45:57.660]   It's such a Gmail and a Fast Mail.
[00:45:57.660 --> 00:45:59.220]   I just-- oh my god.
[00:45:59.220 --> 00:46:02.460]   That pop up, you got-- I was trying to upgrade my internet and something else of the day.
[00:46:02.460 --> 00:46:03.460]   And it wouldn't let me do it online.
[00:46:03.460 --> 00:46:04.700]   I had to talk to a representative.
[00:46:04.700 --> 00:46:05.700]   Sorry.
[00:46:05.700 --> 00:46:06.700]   I don't want to talk to the audience.
[00:46:06.700 --> 00:46:07.700]   I don't want to talk to the audience.
[00:46:07.700 --> 00:46:08.700]   I don't want to talk to the audience.
[00:46:08.700 --> 00:46:09.700]   I don't want to talk to the audience.
[00:46:09.700 --> 00:46:10.700]   I don't want to talk to the audience.
[00:46:10.700 --> 00:46:11.700]   I don't want to talk to the audience.
[00:46:11.700 --> 00:46:12.700]   I don't want to talk to the audience.
[00:46:12.700 --> 00:46:13.700]   I don't want to talk to the audience.
[00:46:13.700 --> 00:46:14.700]   I don't want to talk to the audience.
[00:46:14.700 --> 00:46:15.700]   I don't want to talk to the audience.
[00:46:15.700 --> 00:46:16.700]   I don't want to talk to the audience.
[00:46:16.700 --> 00:46:17.700]   I don't want to talk to the audience.
[00:46:17.700 --> 00:46:18.700]   I don't want to talk to the audience.
[00:46:18.700 --> 00:46:19.700]   I don't want to talk to the audience.
[00:46:19.700 --> 00:46:20.700]   I don't want to talk to the audience.
[00:46:20.700 --> 00:46:21.700]   I don't want to talk to the audience.
[00:46:21.700 --> 00:46:22.700]   I don't want to talk to the audience.
[00:46:22.700 --> 00:46:23.700]   I don't want to talk to the audience.
[00:46:23.700 --> 00:46:30.700]   I don't want to talk to the audience.
[00:46:30.700 --> 00:46:37.700]   I don't want to talk to the audience.
[00:46:37.700 --> 00:46:44.700]   I don't want to talk to the audience.
[00:46:44.700 --> 00:46:45.700]   I don't want to talk to the audience.
[00:46:45.700 --> 00:46:46.700]   I don't want to talk to the audience.
[00:46:46.700 --> 00:46:47.700]   I don't want to talk to the audience.
[00:46:47.700 --> 00:46:48.700]   I don't want to talk to the audience.
[00:46:48.700 --> 00:46:49.700]   I don't want to talk to the audience.
[00:46:49.700 --> 00:46:50.700]   I don't want to talk to the audience.
[00:46:50.700 --> 00:46:51.700]   I don't want to talk to the audience.
[00:46:51.700 --> 00:46:52.700]   I don't want to talk to the audience.
[00:46:52.700 --> 00:46:53.700]   I don't want to talk to the audience.
[00:46:53.700 --> 00:46:54.700]   I don't want to talk to the audience.
[00:46:54.700 --> 00:46:55.700]   I don't want to talk to the audience.
[00:46:55.700 --> 00:46:56.700]   I don't want to talk to the audience.
[00:46:56.700 --> 00:46:57.700]   I don't want to talk to the audience.
[00:46:57.700 --> 00:46:58.700]   I don't want to talk to the audience.
[00:46:58.700 --> 00:46:59.700]   I don't want to talk to the audience.
[00:46:59.700 --> 00:47:00.700]   I don't want to talk to the audience.
[00:47:00.700 --> 00:47:01.700]   I don't want to talk to the audience.
[00:47:01.700 --> 00:47:02.700]   I don't want to talk to the audience.
[00:47:02.700 --> 00:47:03.700]   I don't want to talk to the audience.
[00:47:03.700 --> 00:47:04.700]   I don't want to talk to the audience.
[00:47:04.700 --> 00:47:05.700]   I don't want to talk to the audience.
[00:47:05.700 --> 00:47:06.700]   I don't want to talk to the audience.
[00:47:06.700 --> 00:47:07.700]   I don't want to talk to the audience.
[00:47:07.700 --> 00:47:08.700]   I don't want to talk to the audience.
[00:47:08.700 --> 00:47:09.700]   I don't want to talk to the audience.
[00:47:09.700 --> 00:47:16.700]   I don't want to talk to the audience.
[00:47:16.700 --> 00:47:17.700]   I don't want to talk to the audience.
[00:47:17.700 --> 00:47:18.700]   I don't want to talk to the audience.
[00:47:18.700 --> 00:47:19.700]   I don't want to talk to the audience.

[00:47:26.700 --> 00:47:27.700]   I don't want to talk to the audience.
[00:47:27.700 --> 00:47:28.700]   I don't want to talk to the audience.
[00:47:28.700 --> 00:47:29.700]   I don't want to talk to the audience.
[00:47:29.700 --> 00:47:30.700]   I don't want to talk to the audience.
[00:47:30.700 --> 00:47:31.700]   I don't want to talk to the audience.
[00:47:31.700 --> 00:47:32.700]   I don't want to talk to the audience.
[00:47:32.700 --> 00:47:33.700]   I don't want to talk to the audience.
[00:47:33.700 --> 00:47:40.700]   I don't want to talk to the audience.
[00:47:40.700 --> 00:47:41.700]   I don't want to talk to the audience.
[00:47:41.700 --> 00:47:42.700]   I don't want to talk to the audience.
[00:47:42.700 --> 00:47:43.700]   I don't want to talk to the audience.
[00:47:43.700 --> 00:47:44.700]   I don't want to talk to the audience.
[00:47:44.700 --> 00:47:45.700]   I don't want to talk to the audience.
[00:47:45.700 --> 00:47:46.700]   I don't want to talk to the audience.
[00:47:46.700 --> 00:47:47.700]   I don't want to talk to the audience.
[00:47:47.700 --> 00:47:48.700]   I don't want to talk to the audience.
[00:47:48.700 --> 00:47:49.700]   I don't want to talk to the audience.
[00:47:49.700 --> 00:47:50.700]   I don't want to talk to the audience.
[00:47:50.700 --> 00:47:51.700]   I don't want to talk to the audience.
[00:47:51.700 --> 00:47:52.700]   I don't want to talk to the audience.
[00:47:52.700 --> 00:47:53.700]   I don't want to talk to the audience.
[00:47:53.700 --> 00:47:54.700]   I don't want to talk to the audience.
[00:47:54.700 --> 00:47:55.700]   I don't want to talk to the audience.
[00:47:55.700 --> 00:47:56.700]   I don't want to talk to the audience.
[00:47:56.700 --> 00:47:57.700]   I don't want to talk to the audience.
[00:47:57.700 --> 00:48:03.700]   I don't want to talk to the audience.
[00:48:03.700 --> 00:48:04.700]   I don't want to talk to the audience.
[00:48:04.700 --> 00:48:05.700]   I don't want to talk to the audience.
[00:48:05.700 --> 00:48:06.700]   I don't want to talk to the audience.
[00:48:06.700 --> 00:48:07.700]   I don't want to talk to the audience.
[00:48:07.700 --> 00:48:08.700]   I don't want to talk to the audience.
[00:48:08.700 --> 00:48:09.700]   I don't want to talk to the audience.
[00:48:09.700 --> 00:48:10.700]   I don't want to talk to the audience.
[00:48:10.700 --> 00:48:11.700]   I don't want to talk to the audience.
[00:48:11.700 --> 00:48:12.700]   I don't want to talk to the audience.
[00:48:12.700 --> 00:48:13.700]   I don't want to talk to the audience.
[00:48:13.700 --> 00:48:14.700]   I don't want to talk to the audience.
[00:48:14.700 --> 00:48:15.700]   I don't want to talk to the audience.
[00:48:15.700 --> 00:48:16.700]   I don't want to talk to the audience.
[00:48:16.700 --> 00:48:17.700]   I don't want to talk to the audience.
[00:48:17.700 --> 00:48:18.700]   I don't want to talk to the audience.
[00:48:18.700 --> 00:48:19.700]   I don't want to talk to the audience.
[00:48:19.700 --> 00:48:20.700]   I don't want to talk to the audience.
[00:48:20.700 --> 00:48:27.700]   I'm still getting an awful lot of it.
[00:48:27.700 --> 00:48:33.700]   When you die, your hair and fingernails continue to grow,
[00:48:33.700 --> 00:48:38.700]   but email tends to drop off.
[00:48:38.700 --> 00:48:42.700]   I feel like for now, I need a good email server
[00:48:42.700 --> 00:48:45.700]   and a good email client on iOS.
[00:48:45.700 --> 00:48:49.700]   I bet you, I'm going to guess you guys just use apples on mail client.
[00:48:49.700 --> 00:48:51.700]   What do you use, Jim?
[00:48:51.700 --> 00:48:53.700]   Oh, I use apple mail.
[00:48:53.700 --> 00:48:55.700]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:48:55.700 --> 00:48:56.700]   On iOS as well.
[00:48:56.700 --> 00:48:58.700]   Oh, yeah.
[00:48:58.700 --> 00:48:59.700]   How about you, Renee?
[00:48:59.700 --> 00:49:00.700]   Yeah, I use mail.
[00:49:00.700 --> 00:49:02.700]   Primarily because I have apple mail, Google mail,
[00:49:02.700 --> 00:49:04.700]   and a couple other email accounts,
[00:49:04.700 --> 00:49:06.700]   and it gives me an integrated inbox for all of that.
[00:49:06.700 --> 00:49:09.700]   Like the unified inbox is just the best way my brain knows
[00:49:09.700 --> 00:49:10.700]   that I can track a mail.
[00:49:10.700 --> 00:49:11.700]   Great.
[00:49:11.700 --> 00:49:12.700]   Yeah, me too.
[00:49:12.700 --> 00:49:14.700]   And how about you, Andy?
[00:49:14.700 --> 00:49:15.700]   I do have apple mail.
[00:49:15.700 --> 00:49:18.700]   I do keep it for unified inbox.
[00:49:18.700 --> 00:49:22.700]   I'm looking for other solutions that I know that I believe might be as good,
[00:49:22.700 --> 00:49:23.700]   but I haven't tried them yet.
[00:49:23.700 --> 00:49:28.700]   But when it comes to, I already have a system that puts everything that I need to know about
[00:49:28.700 --> 00:49:33.700]   into a special address, and that's what I mostly spend my time looking at.
[00:49:33.700 --> 00:49:39.700]   Outlook is good for that sort of stuff, but I'm not saying that the mail app is useless.
[00:49:39.700 --> 00:49:42.700]   On the desktop, it's what I'm used to.
[00:49:42.700 --> 00:49:46.700]   It does work very, very effectively, and it's been a couple of years since it's screwed up on me
[00:49:46.700 --> 00:49:50.700]   or made me think that I was archiving 10,000 messages when it was actually deleting them
[00:49:50.700 --> 00:49:53.700]   from the server as I watched and screamed and horror.
[00:49:53.700 --> 00:49:55.700]   So it's not terrible.
[00:49:55.700 --> 00:49:59.700]   I do think that the iOS apps that Microsoft provides for Outlook are much better.
[00:49:59.700 --> 00:50:02.700]   There's just so many more features that I like.
[00:50:02.700 --> 00:50:06.700]   Just the ability to -- all the times that I've had to say to myself,
[00:50:06.700 --> 00:50:10.700]   "Oh, that's a really good email, but I'm standing on a platform waiting for a train.
[00:50:10.700 --> 00:50:12.700]   I need five seconds of clear thought.
[00:50:12.700 --> 00:50:17.700]   I will schedule this to be reminded of this to reply to it in four hours' time,
[00:50:17.700 --> 00:50:20.700]   and it's just easier just to triage my mailbox that way."
[00:50:20.700 --> 00:50:26.700]   It's not -- it's stuff that that mail app on iOS could do but doesn't yet, so there's hope.
[00:50:26.700 --> 00:50:29.700]   Well, Apple does that with a lot of its apps, though.
[00:50:29.700 --> 00:50:36.700]   I mean, it makes a basic functional app with some -- sometimes some advanced features,
[00:50:36.700 --> 00:50:41.700]   but they leave a lot of room for third parties to come out with new ideas
[00:50:41.700 --> 00:50:43.700]   and new ways to do things.
[00:50:43.700 --> 00:50:44.700]   And I think that's good.
[00:50:44.700 --> 00:50:45.700]   It's good for Apple to do that.
[00:50:45.700 --> 00:50:49.700]   I mean, Calendar is a perfect example of that because you have fantastic Calendar.
[00:50:49.700 --> 00:50:53.700]   You have other Calendar apps that do more advanced things.
[00:50:53.700 --> 00:50:58.700]   But Calendar itself, if you get an iPhone or an iPad,
[00:50:58.700 --> 00:51:00.700]   every app that you need is there.
[00:51:00.700 --> 00:51:01.700]   You have Calendar.
[00:51:01.700 --> 00:51:02.700]   You have mail.
[00:51:02.700 --> 00:51:07.700]   You have a web browser and the all-important stocks app.
[00:51:07.700 --> 00:51:15.700]   You have all of these apps that allow you to get started and do whatever you need to do.
[00:51:15.700 --> 00:51:19.700]   And if you become a more advanced user, or if you already are a more advanced user,
[00:51:19.700 --> 00:51:23.700]   then you can download more advanced apps and pay for those.
[00:51:23.700 --> 00:51:30.700]   But I think Apple's strategy of making sure that you can do whatever you need to do right off the bat is a good one.
[00:51:30.700 --> 00:51:31.700]   It's a solid strategy.
[00:51:31.700 --> 00:51:32.700]   Yeah.
[00:51:32.700 --> 00:51:34.700]   No, it makes sense.
[00:51:34.700 --> 00:51:37.700]   I mean, you know, I've tried sunrise and...
[00:51:37.700 --> 00:51:39.700]   Fantastico.
[00:51:39.700 --> 00:51:43.700]   It's just a little bit difficult.
[00:51:43.700 --> 00:51:46.700]   I mean, that is actually the right way to go.
[00:51:46.700 --> 00:51:51.700]   Oddly enough, they can do some damage by making those built-in apps too good.
[00:51:51.700 --> 00:51:57.700]   There's a reason why Microsoft would ship an app called Notepad that the big deal,
[00:51:57.700 --> 00:52:01.700]   it's a big deal that for a while that it could do both face and italics instead of being a plain text editor.
[00:52:01.700 --> 00:52:07.700]   Because once you start shipping like a really full-featured male client or a really, really full-featured calendar app,
[00:52:07.700 --> 00:52:11.700]   you're kind of discouraging other developers from creating your own mail app.
[00:52:11.700 --> 00:52:17.700]   As we were just talking, the default app is going to be sticky in people's minds and sticky on people's desktops.
[00:52:17.700 --> 00:52:20.700]   That's going to be the thing that they're going to just go for for mail.
[00:52:20.700 --> 00:52:23.700]   And if they're not aware that they can do better, excuse me, for their particular needs,
[00:52:23.700 --> 00:52:26.700]   they might be able to do better than the stock iOS app.
[00:52:26.700 --> 00:52:28.700]   They're not going to go looking for an app.
[00:52:28.700 --> 00:52:32.700]   And then there's a problem of trying to charge them more than, you know, 89 cents for it.
[00:52:32.700 --> 00:52:34.700]   So it must be a balancing act.
[00:52:34.700 --> 00:52:39.700]   There must be a whole bunch of... I imagine there's a whole bunch of things on the whiteboard inside in Cupertino
[00:52:39.700 --> 00:52:42.700]   about stuff they would like to do, but they don't want to take...
[00:52:42.700 --> 00:52:46.700]   For their own purposes... For their own sanity, they don't want to devote the time and resources
[00:52:46.700 --> 00:52:54.700]   to adding a whole lot of next-level features to a free stock product when they have so many resources
[00:52:54.700 --> 00:52:57.700]   that they can only so many resources for the entire project.
[00:52:57.700 --> 00:53:02.700]   And also, part of their thinking must be that we can't just say there is no reason for anybody
[00:53:02.700 --> 00:53:08.700]   ever to buy a third-party email app or calendar app because we're going to give you the best one that's available.
[00:53:08.700 --> 00:53:11.700]   Let's take a break.
[00:53:11.700 --> 00:53:12.700]   Come back with more.
[00:53:12.700 --> 00:53:16.700]   Jim Del Rimples here from the loop, loopinsight.com.
[00:53:16.700 --> 00:53:18.700]   Andy Enaco.
[00:53:18.700 --> 00:53:21.700]   Okay, maybe I spoke too soon.
[00:53:21.700 --> 00:53:23.700]   Andy...
[00:53:23.700 --> 00:53:24.700]   Jim was here.
[00:53:24.700 --> 00:53:25.700]   Hi, Dr. Munkon.
[00:53:25.700 --> 00:53:28.700]   Jim, when do you have to take off, by the way?
[00:53:28.700 --> 00:53:30.700]   When do you have to take off, Jim?
[00:53:30.700 --> 00:53:31.700]   One o'clock.
[00:53:31.700 --> 00:53:34.700]   Okay, we got half an hour.
[00:53:34.700 --> 00:53:43.700]   And then Andy Enaco from the Chicago Sun Times and Renee Ritchie from the I'more folks.
[00:53:43.700 --> 00:53:45.700]   Our show today brought to you by Lynda.com.
[00:53:45.700 --> 00:53:46.700]   I know you love to learn.
[00:53:46.700 --> 00:53:47.700]   You're a learner.
[00:53:47.700 --> 00:53:48.700]   Yeah, face it.
[00:53:48.700 --> 00:53:49.700]   Okay, don't deny it.
[00:53:49.700 --> 00:53:52.700]   You listen to these shows because you want to learn.
[00:53:52.700 --> 00:53:56.700]   You probably...you know, you got a big brain.
[00:53:56.700 --> 00:53:58.700]   You probably read books even.
[00:53:58.700 --> 00:54:01.700]   But have you experienced Lynda.com yet?
[00:54:01.700 --> 00:54:03.700]   This is like the place for learners.

[00:54:10.700 --> 00:54:16.700]   And what's great is when you join Lynda.com, you pay one flat rate every month or you can get a yearly plan.
[00:54:16.700 --> 00:54:19.700]   And by doing that, you don't have to declare a major.
[00:54:19.700 --> 00:54:20.700]   You get everything.
[00:54:20.700 --> 00:54:22.700]   All the courses.
[00:54:22.700 --> 00:54:26.700]   So you can just take a little bit here, a little bit there, take a full course somewhere else.
[00:54:26.700 --> 00:54:31.700]   They do have certificates so that you can prove that you've completed the course, things like that.
[00:54:31.700 --> 00:54:33.700]   I love it for...you know, my hobbies.
[00:54:33.700 --> 00:54:34.700]   I have a couple hobbies.
[00:54:34.700 --> 00:54:35.700]   I like to code.
[00:54:35.700 --> 00:54:37.700]   I've got great stuff on coding.
[00:54:37.700 --> 00:54:39.700]   Really amazing stuff on coding.
[00:54:39.700 --> 00:54:40.700]   Including Swift.
[00:54:40.700 --> 00:54:44.700]   And I know a lot of you with the new announcement are very interested in Swift.
[00:54:44.700 --> 00:54:46.700]   And I like to take pictures.
[00:54:46.700 --> 00:54:47.700]   I love photography.
[00:54:47.700 --> 00:54:49.700]   And it's great for that too.
[00:54:49.700 --> 00:54:54.700]   If you're interested in photography, they've got iPhone and iPad photography with iOS 9.
[00:54:54.700 --> 00:54:55.700]   That's a whole course.
[00:54:55.700 --> 00:54:56.700]   Oh, program.
[00:54:56.700 --> 00:54:58.700]   This is an awesome course.
[00:54:58.700 --> 00:55:03.700]   Todd Perkins programming for non-programmers with Swift on iOS 9.
[00:55:03.700 --> 00:55:08.700]   Creating cards, calendars and books with photos for OS 10.
[00:55:08.700 --> 00:55:11.700]   Courses on performance tuning, your Canon digital SLR.
[00:55:11.700 --> 00:55:14.700]   This is how granular they can get, or Nikon D5500.
[00:55:14.700 --> 00:55:21.700]   But also larger subjects like the Photos Tools Weekly, which I love, the Burt Monroys Pixel Playground.
[00:55:21.700 --> 00:55:22.700]   You know what?
[00:55:22.700 --> 00:55:25.700]   I'm never going to be a Photoshop guy like Burt Monroy.
[00:55:25.700 --> 00:55:32.700]   I know it, but I still love...there's my buddy Ben Long looking sharp out there learning to be a better photographer.
[00:55:32.700 --> 00:55:35.700]   But I love Pixel Playground.
[00:55:35.700 --> 00:55:43.700]   Right now, he's working on...this week is about...it's like a kiosk in New York City, how you can create an amazing...
[00:55:43.700 --> 00:55:46.700]   He makes photorealistic Photoshop paintings.
[00:55:46.700 --> 00:55:49.700]   You learn techniques in Photoshop that just blow your mind.
[00:55:49.700 --> 00:55:53.700]   The DIY photographer, that's Joseph L'Nashki.
[00:55:53.700 --> 00:55:58.700]   He does a great job, too, using stuff you have around the house, low-cost tricks and techniques to make your photography better.
[00:55:58.700 --> 00:56:08.700]   It's just...you know, it's...you go there and even if you have just a few minutes, if you're going to be in a plane, you can download the tutorials and watch them,

[00:56:12.700 --> 00:56:14.700]   They have transcripts.
[00:56:14.700 --> 00:56:17.700]   It's just like it feels like you're going to college. It's just great.
[00:56:17.700 --> 00:56:20.700]   He's making a billboard here. I love this.
[00:56:20.700 --> 00:56:22.700]   So cool.
[00:56:22.700 --> 00:56:23.700]   Don't get me started. I won't watch.

[00:56:40.700 --> 00:56:42.700]   You do a great job.
[00:56:42.700 --> 00:56:45.700]   Did you guys read this above Avalon post?
[00:56:45.700 --> 00:56:54.700]   The grand unified theory of Apple products. He's basing it on a Tim Cook interview...no, I'm sorry, Phil Schiller interview with Stephen Levy.
[00:56:54.700 --> 00:57:00.700]   That didn't get a lot of attention, but Schiller said something that kind of got Dan thinking.
[00:57:00.700 --> 00:57:05.700]   He says...
[00:57:05.700 --> 00:57:09.700]   He took the opportunity to discuss a new way of thinking about the Apple product line,
[00:57:09.700 --> 00:57:13.700]   and I found it to be most revealing from a strategic perspective.
[00:57:13.700 --> 00:57:19.700]   Instead of describing how each product has a new unique role in our lives, which most companies do,
[00:57:19.700 --> 00:57:23.700]   you know, here's how you would use it, or simply placing Apple's entire product category in the same spectrum
[00:57:23.700 --> 00:57:27.700]   with an Apple watch here, all the way to the iMac there,
[00:57:27.700 --> 00:57:32.700]   and Schiller gave each product a job, make consumers...this is really interesting.
[00:57:32.700 --> 00:57:41.700]   I'm curious what you think. Make consumers feel like they don't need...they don't need a larger, more powerful Apple device in their life.
[00:57:41.700 --> 00:57:46.700]   So the job of the Apple watch to do more and more things on your wrist so you don't need to use your phone as often.
[00:57:46.700 --> 00:57:50.700]   The job of the phone to do more and more things so that maybe you don't need your iPad.
[00:57:50.700 --> 00:57:54.700]   The job of the iPad, to be so powerful cable you never need a notebook.
[00:57:54.700 --> 00:57:58.700]   The job of the notebook to make it so you never need a desktop.
[00:57:58.700 --> 00:58:00.700]   And what's the job of the desktop?
[00:58:00.700 --> 00:58:03.700]   Its job is to challenge what we think a computer can do.
[00:58:03.700 --> 00:58:06.700]   The iMac in particular, notice he doesn't mention the Mac Pro.
[00:58:06.700 --> 00:58:11.700]   It's going to be saying that there's nothing above the Mac Pro, so there's no reason to ever buy a Mac Pro.
[00:58:11.700 --> 00:58:12.700]   Never buy a Mac Pro.
[00:58:12.700 --> 00:58:17.700]   The job of the iMac is to challenge what we think a computer can do, and by the way, I think it does this really well,
[00:58:17.700 --> 00:58:22.700]   and do things no computers ever done before, be more and more powerful and capable so that we need a desktop.
[00:58:22.700 --> 00:58:27.700]   We need a desktop because of its capabilities, because if all its doing is competing with the notebook
[00:58:27.700 --> 00:58:30.700]   and being thinner and lighter then it doesn't need to exist.
[00:58:30.700 --> 00:58:31.700]   What do you think?
[00:58:31.700 --> 00:58:34.700]   This is an interesting way to think about Apple's product line.
[00:58:34.700 --> 00:58:35.700]   Yeah, it's sort of that thing.
[00:58:35.700 --> 00:58:36.700]   I forget when we talked about it.
[00:58:36.700 --> 00:58:40.700]   I think maybe we talked about it when the watch first came out where like my father bought an Apple II Plus
[00:58:40.700 --> 00:58:42.700]   so he wouldn't have to drive downtown and use an IBM mainframe.
[00:58:42.700 --> 00:58:47.700]   And then I got an iPhone so I wouldn't have to stick to my Mac all the time and I could go off and do other interesting things.
[00:58:47.700 --> 00:58:50.700]   And then you get an Apple watch so you don't have to pull your iPhone out of the pocket.
[00:58:50.700 --> 00:58:58.700]   And each one can't do as much as the one that came before, but it can do certain frequent, brief, important tasks
[00:58:58.700 --> 00:59:00.700]   better than the thing that came before.
[00:59:00.700 --> 00:59:05.700]   And that gives them sort of that important role why you'd be willing to add something else to our portfolio.
[00:59:05.700 --> 00:59:08.700]   And over time they get more and more capable and now on an iPhone or an iPad.
[00:59:08.700 --> 00:59:14.700]   You can do many more Mac-y things, but at the same time the Mac gets more and more powerful so you can do things that you never could do before.
[00:59:14.700 --> 00:59:20.700]   I think that's sort of like the beneficial cycle that Apple gets from their integrated approach.
[00:59:20.700 --> 00:59:26.700]   It is really a device spectrum and not a set of unique products that sort of self-compete for their own businesses.
[00:59:26.700 --> 00:59:27.700]   Yeah.
[00:59:27.700 --> 00:59:28.700]   Yeah.
[00:59:28.700 --> 00:59:37.700]   I mean we've always, I think forever we've been talking about like the George Carlin place, the routine that I place for my stuff about how the...
[00:59:37.700 --> 00:59:38.700]   Right.
[00:59:38.700 --> 00:59:54.700]   The house is just a big pile of your stuff with the cover on it and then you go to...
[00:59:54.700 --> 00:59:56.700]   I don't disagree with what he's saying.
[00:59:56.700 --> 00:59:58.700]   I think it's a little bit more subtle than that.
[00:59:58.700 --> 01:00:00.700]   I think it's more like...
[01:00:00.700 --> 01:00:03.700]   I think it's more like they understand that there's so many...
[01:00:03.700 --> 01:00:14.700]   Their audience is so big now and their needs are so unpredictable that it's not in their best interest to say that here is your default Mac which is the MacBook Pro.
[01:00:14.700 --> 01:00:18.700]   And if you want something that's really, really light, get yourself a MacBook Air.
[01:00:18.700 --> 01:00:27.700]   And if you just need just a mobile apps, just get an iPad, really it's best for them to say here is what we sell and we're going to sell a lot of different things.
[01:00:27.700 --> 01:00:30.700]   We're going to sell three different sizes of iPads.
[01:00:30.700 --> 01:00:35.700]   And you look at all these four, decide which one of them really speaks to you.
[01:00:35.700 --> 01:00:38.700]   This seems to be this is exactly what I need and what I want.
[01:00:38.700 --> 01:00:39.700]   Great.
[01:00:39.700 --> 01:00:41.700]   Because that's exactly who we designed it for.
[01:00:41.700 --> 01:00:45.700]   You're brilliant because we had exactly the uses that you have in mind in mind for you.
[01:00:45.700 --> 01:00:47.700]   And of course, that's going to be different for every person.
[01:00:47.700 --> 01:00:51.700]   With the iPad Pro, I appreciate so many people who...
[01:00:51.700 --> 01:00:58.700]   I've been tweeting pictures every now and then of "I've got my Kensin and my Logitech keyboard, my little stand and my keyboard.
[01:00:58.700 --> 01:01:00.700]   My little stand and my iPad Pro.
[01:01:00.700 --> 01:01:01.700]   Absolutely love it.
[01:01:01.700 --> 01:01:04.700]   I was riding on the train back and forth yesterday.
[01:01:04.700 --> 01:01:08.700]   Lots of people saying that, well, it seems like it would be simpler just to have a MacBook.
[01:01:08.700 --> 01:01:10.700]   And it's well, no, I've looked at...
[01:01:10.700 --> 01:01:18.700]   I've been able to buy MacBook, 13-inch MacBook Airs for several years now, but none of them spoke to me as a solution to any problem that I had.
[01:01:18.700 --> 01:01:22.700]   Whereas the iPad Pro is a very specific solution to a specific problem that I had.
[01:01:22.700 --> 01:01:24.700]   And I think that's the sort of stuff we're looking at.
[01:01:24.700 --> 01:01:30.700]   Instead of making that grid of mobile, we have desktop, we have professional, we have...
[01:01:30.700 --> 01:01:32.700]   It's a two by two grid that used to do.
[01:01:32.700 --> 01:01:35.700]   It's going to be here is a constellation of stuff.
[01:01:35.700 --> 01:01:43.700]   We're going to not make more stuff than we can really produce and sell, but we're going to try to make more than a few things.
[01:01:43.700 --> 01:01:48.700]   And we're going to basically let people come in, try things on and decide which one works for them.
[01:01:48.700 --> 01:01:50.700]   Yeah, I mean, it's a change.
[01:01:50.700 --> 01:01:58.700]   In fact, he points out that over the last four years, Apple has doubled its product line from 12 models to more than 24.
[01:01:58.700 --> 01:02:03.700]   And when you're talking SKUs, of course, because of all the finishes and so forth, it's considerably more than that.
[01:02:03.700 --> 01:02:05.700]   And that is a departure for Apple.
[01:02:05.700 --> 01:02:13.700]   But Apple has incredibly improved its production lines, its abilities to create this stuff.
[01:02:13.700 --> 01:02:16.700]   Yeah, you have to add addressable markets if you want to grow.
[01:02:16.700 --> 01:02:17.700]   Yeah, I guess, huh.
[01:02:17.700 --> 01:02:18.700]   Yeah.
[01:02:18.700 --> 01:02:20.700]   All right.
[01:02:20.700 --> 01:02:24.700]   It's worth reading aboveavilon.com if you want to...
[01:02:24.700 --> 01:02:27.700]   The artist formerly known as Sammy the Walrus.
[01:02:27.700 --> 01:02:29.700]   Is that who it is?
[01:02:29.700 --> 01:02:30.700]   Yeah, it's Neil Seibert.
[01:02:30.700 --> 01:02:31.700]   He was known as Sammy the Walrus.
[01:02:31.700 --> 01:02:32.700]   Neil, that's Dan.
[01:02:32.700 --> 01:02:37.700]   He was an anonymous Wall Street insider, and then he came out to the site, which is terrific.
[01:02:37.700 --> 01:02:41.700]   Sammy the Walrus, this is what he thinks, Neil Seibert.
[01:02:41.700 --> 01:02:43.700]   We all need names like that.
[01:02:43.700 --> 01:02:47.700]   Do you mean to be here, Sammy the Walrus?
[01:02:47.700 --> 01:02:48.700]   Do you mean to be here?
[01:02:48.700 --> 01:02:50.700]   Only if you get to choose it yourself.
[01:02:50.700 --> 01:02:52.700]   Don't let any of the people...
[01:02:52.700 --> 01:02:58.700]   I did notice that I ordered my mom and iPad Pro because she's an artist and I wanted to get the pencil.
[01:02:58.700 --> 01:03:00.700]   It's not going to come until January 15th.
[01:03:00.700 --> 01:03:03.700]   They're still having a hard time with this.
[01:03:03.700 --> 01:03:05.700]   It was a stack at Best Buy, and I grabbed an additional one.
[01:03:05.700 --> 01:03:06.700]   I know.
[01:03:06.700 --> 01:03:08.700]   I saw three, three whole ones at the Apple store.
[01:03:08.700 --> 01:03:10.700]   I should have bought one extra.
[01:03:10.700 --> 01:03:12.700]   Maybe I'll set her mine until she gets it.
[01:03:12.700 --> 01:03:14.700]   That's the nicest thing you can possibly do.
[01:03:14.700 --> 01:03:19.700]   If I ever see an Apple pencil available for sale anywhere, I will buy it.
[01:03:19.700 --> 01:03:26.700]   Not even just for myself because I know for a fact that I can find at least 17 people that will love to take it off by hand.
[01:03:26.700 --> 01:03:27.700]   It's so strange.
[01:03:27.700 --> 01:03:28.700]   Why are they...
[01:03:28.700 --> 01:03:32.700]   They're putting them in the stores, but they're back ordering them like crazy.
[01:03:32.700 --> 01:03:34.700]   It's separate supplies.
[01:03:34.700 --> 01:03:36.700]   You always want to make sure that people aren't disappointed.
[01:03:36.700 --> 01:03:38.700]   They set aside some for online deliverings, some for retail.
[01:03:38.700 --> 01:03:41.700]   People who go to stores aren't just told to go on an order.
[01:03:41.700 --> 01:03:46.700]   By the way, we never really decided, "Is Apple going to announce..."
[01:03:46.700 --> 01:03:48.700]   I never heard a yet per anope.
[01:03:48.700 --> 01:03:51.700]   Is Apple going to announce a new watch on March?
[01:03:51.700 --> 01:03:52.700]   It's so new and exciting, Leo.
[01:03:52.700 --> 01:03:54.700]   There's no product cycle for watch yet.
[01:03:54.700 --> 01:03:55.700]   It's a brand new thing.
[01:03:55.700 --> 01:03:56.700]   We just don't know.
[01:03:56.700 --> 01:03:58.700]   Even the iPads now, they're playing with it.
[01:03:58.700 --> 01:04:00.700]   The iPad Air didn't get updated this fall.
[01:04:00.700 --> 01:04:01.700]   It's going to take longer than it was.
[01:04:01.700 --> 01:04:04.700]   I was convinced it'd be two years before they do a new watch.
[01:04:04.700 --> 01:04:05.700]   I really was.
[01:04:05.700 --> 01:04:12.700]   I felt like I think that all depends on what the original plan was for the watch.
[01:04:12.700 --> 01:04:16.700]   We know that they're always three to five years ahead.
[01:04:16.700 --> 01:04:21.700]   They could have already been there and known...
[01:04:21.700 --> 01:04:22.700]   Right.
[01:04:22.700 --> 01:04:26.700]   Not knowing what the product cycle is, but guessing that it would be a yearly...
[01:04:26.700 --> 01:04:29.700]   iPad 2 was transformatively better, and so was iPhone 3G.
[01:04:29.700 --> 01:04:30.700]   It's interesting.
[01:04:30.700 --> 01:04:34.700]   But if you paid 17,000 dollars for your gold watch, you're not going to be happy.
[01:04:34.700 --> 01:04:36.700]   You won't care because you're buying it because it's the gold.
[01:04:36.700 --> 01:04:38.700]   You're not buying it to have the latest technology.
[01:04:38.700 --> 01:04:43.700]   You're buying it because 17,000 dollars is the same thing that you pay for your Singapore Airlines flight to Tokyo.
[01:04:43.700 --> 01:04:44.700]   Right.
[01:04:44.700 --> 01:04:45.700]   And you're going to buy that over and over again.
[01:04:45.700 --> 01:04:46.700]   What do you say, Leo?
[01:04:46.700 --> 01:04:49.700]   Do we pay employees a living wage?
[01:04:49.700 --> 01:04:52.700]   Or do I have a gold gadget watch on my wrist?
[01:04:52.700 --> 01:04:53.700]   It's going to take a point.
[01:04:53.700 --> 01:04:54.700]   It's going to take a point.
[01:04:54.700 --> 01:04:55.700]   Really?
[01:04:55.700 --> 01:04:56.700]   I got to talk to someone who hadn't...
[01:04:56.700 --> 01:04:57.700]   And it really is a different world.
[01:04:57.700 --> 01:04:59.700]   Their airline tickets cost tens of thousands of dollars.
[01:04:59.700 --> 01:05:03.700]   They buy the $20,000 address and it only gets worn once.
[01:05:03.700 --> 01:05:06.700]   The five-star hotel room costs more than I think I've paid for.
[01:05:06.700 --> 01:05:07.700]   Yeah.
[01:05:07.700 --> 01:05:08.700]   Let's plane tickets.
[01:05:08.700 --> 01:05:09.700]   It's a completely different world.
[01:05:09.700 --> 01:05:11.700]   It's not ours.
[01:05:11.700 --> 01:05:13.700]   And I got the stainless steel.
[01:05:13.700 --> 01:05:15.700]   I didn't get the sport one.
[01:05:15.700 --> 01:05:18.700]   But of course, if they announce what I'm marching, I'll get a new one.
[01:05:18.700 --> 01:05:20.700]   And I mean, not even sold on the watch.
[01:05:20.700 --> 01:05:24.700]   I think I was with Jim at the watch of launching Palo Alto,
[01:05:24.700 --> 01:05:30.700]   and there was a whole group of people who all looked like retired semiconductor people trying to figure out which gold watch they were buying.
[01:05:30.700 --> 01:05:31.700]   Oh, yeah.
[01:05:31.700 --> 01:05:33.700]   They were buying the gold watch.
[01:05:33.700 --> 01:05:34.700]   Which left.
[01:05:34.700 --> 01:05:39.700]   And Jim and I were just looking at them and thinking, "And I'm trying to figure out which sport model I'm going to get."
[01:05:39.700 --> 01:05:41.700]   Can I exactly kick?
[01:05:41.700 --> 01:05:44.700]   I'm going to get the villainies loop in addition to the free band?
[01:05:44.700 --> 01:05:49.700]   Or am I going to just be calculating how many words I have to write until I've eaten the cost of this?
[01:05:49.700 --> 01:05:56.700]   I was also trying to figure out how I was going to smash the display glass and run out with it because, you know, even the sport one.
[01:05:56.700 --> 01:05:59.700]   You know, they thought that when you walked in.
[01:05:59.700 --> 01:06:00.700]   Yeah.
[01:06:00.700 --> 01:06:02.700]   Well, you know, the...
[01:06:02.700 --> 01:06:14.700]   I think that Apple's devices are very well-priced myself because what you get is so useful and it lasts so long.
[01:06:14.700 --> 01:06:15.700]   Okay.
[01:06:15.700 --> 01:06:16.700]   You know?
[01:06:16.700 --> 01:06:17.700]   It's a unique perspective.
[01:06:17.700 --> 01:06:21.700]   Apparently, I don't mind paying up for quality.
[01:06:21.700 --> 01:06:23.700]   I didn't mind paying for the MacBook.
[01:06:23.700 --> 01:06:29.700]   I felt like, although that's pricey for what you're getting, I'm going to get $1,400 value out of it.
[01:06:29.700 --> 01:06:30.700]   Yeah.
[01:06:30.700 --> 01:06:34.700]   I do think that the Apple Watch Edition is probably the most embarrassing thing that Apple's ever made.
[01:06:34.700 --> 01:06:41.700]   But when you look at, for instance, the sport edition and the Apple Watch Edition, the Apple Watch nothing,
[01:06:41.700 --> 01:06:48.700]   and you compare it to pretty much every other maker on the market that's not a tag, please, of course, correct me on the printout.
[01:06:48.700 --> 01:06:51.700]   The tag "hier", "tag-hoor", whatever.
[01:06:51.700 --> 01:06:52.700]   How are you pronouncing?
[01:06:52.700 --> 01:06:53.700]   Like, how is it...
[01:06:53.700 --> 01:06:55.700]   I'm kind of like hearing you attempt to pronounce it.
[01:06:55.700 --> 01:06:56.700]   Don't tell me.
[01:06:56.700 --> 01:07:03.700]   The only thing I can remember is that no matter how I pronounce it, someone corrects me because, again, I do not live in the world of $1,500 watches.
[01:07:03.700 --> 01:07:05.700]   I love my Moda360.
[01:07:05.700 --> 01:07:10.700]   This is the one that actually purchased for myself, had a review in it, but I had to buy one of my own.
[01:07:10.700 --> 01:07:19.700]   It's a nicely made watch, but you compare this to even the Apple Watch Sport Edition, and you feel as those sport edition is better constructed.
[01:07:19.700 --> 01:07:24.700]   You feel as though if something's going to last me five years, it's certainly going to be the sport edition and not this.
[01:07:24.700 --> 01:07:26.700]   If something's going to have...
[01:07:26.700 --> 01:07:32.700]   If I don't actually be active with it and therefore don't scratch it up, could I sell this to somebody in two or three years?
[01:07:32.700 --> 01:07:35.700]   Certainly for the Apple Sport Edition, maybe not for this.
[01:07:35.700 --> 01:07:37.700]   When you look at the forums...
[01:07:37.700 --> 01:07:38.700]   You didn't...
[01:07:38.700 --> 01:07:40.700]   Wait, did I miss understood? You didn't buy the "tag-hoor".
[01:07:40.700 --> 01:07:41.700]   Oh, no, no.
[01:07:41.700 --> 01:07:42.700]   Oh, no, okay.
[01:07:42.700 --> 01:07:43.700]   No, this was like $200.
[01:07:43.700 --> 01:07:44.700]   That's the Modo360.
[01:07:44.700 --> 01:07:45.700]   Yeah, no, no, no.
[01:07:45.700 --> 01:07:46.700]   Yeah, no, no, no.
[01:07:46.700 --> 01:07:52.700]   I'm actually looking forward to looking at the Wayway Android Wear Watch, which is real stainless steel.
[01:07:52.700 --> 01:07:53.700]   But...
[01:07:53.700 --> 01:07:54.700]   I have a lot for those updates.
[01:07:54.700 --> 01:07:55.700]   I'm just...
[01:07:55.700 --> 01:07:57.700]   It just bothers me that...
[01:07:57.700 --> 01:08:02.700]   I wish that the affordable model were more affordable, and it also just doesn't make any sense.
[01:08:02.700 --> 01:08:10.700]   When I look at the accessory bands, I'm like, I do not see this band, this stainless steel band costing $500 of anybody's money.
[01:08:10.700 --> 01:08:14.700]   I see their $150 leather strap, and I see that's a nice strap.
[01:08:14.700 --> 01:08:19.700]   If I got that free with a watch, I'd say, "Wow, they really gave me a nice free band."
[01:08:19.700 --> 01:08:21.700]   I would not spend $150 on it.
[01:08:21.700 --> 01:08:23.700]   It doesn't look like a $150 band.
[01:08:23.700 --> 01:08:27.700]   It doesn't look as good as the band that I got on last year's Modo360 for free.
[01:08:27.700 --> 01:08:31.700]   You know, the tag "hoorier" is sold out for like months.
[01:08:31.700 --> 01:08:33.700]   Yeah, but they're making like $2000.
[01:08:33.700 --> 01:08:34.700]   Yeah.
[01:08:34.700 --> 01:08:36.700]   They're not like making millions of them.
[01:08:36.700 --> 01:08:37.700]   Somebody wants them.
[01:08:37.700 --> 01:08:38.700]   I would get noticed.
[01:08:38.700 --> 01:08:39.700]   Yeah.
[01:08:39.700 --> 01:08:40.700]   I mean, that's not...
[01:08:40.700 --> 01:08:42.700]   Cheaper than an Apple, a gold Apple watch.
[01:08:42.700 --> 01:08:46.700]   Particularly because you're selling them specifically to tag owners.
[01:08:46.700 --> 01:08:47.700]   Right.
[01:08:47.700 --> 01:08:48.700]   Yeah.
[01:08:48.700 --> 01:08:52.700]   I'm sure Apple's never going to release the figures, but I'd love to see if they're selling
[01:08:52.700 --> 01:08:58.700]   two or 3,000 gold watches every quarter, let's say, or whether that's just...
[01:08:58.700 --> 01:09:01.700]   Whether it turned out to be just pretty much a promotional thing.
[01:09:01.700 --> 01:09:06.700]   Apparently a duvet store opening was a fairly large set of gold watches.
[01:09:06.700 --> 01:09:07.700]   Oh, I bet they did.
[01:09:07.700 --> 01:09:08.700]   You'd expect that.
[01:09:08.700 --> 01:09:09.700]   Yeah.
[01:09:09.700 --> 01:09:10.700]   Probably something like that is right there.
[01:09:10.700 --> 01:09:11.700]   Hey, good news.
[01:09:11.700 --> 01:09:12.700]   Swift is open.
[01:09:12.700 --> 01:09:16.700]   Source kind of alluded to that earlier in the Lynda.com ad.
[01:09:16.700 --> 01:09:18.700]   Apple making good.
[01:09:18.700 --> 01:09:21.700]   It's promised that it would be an open source computing system.
[01:09:21.700 --> 01:09:26.700]   Already people have ported it to Linux from the GitHub repository and IBM.
[01:09:26.700 --> 01:09:27.700]   I love this.
[01:09:27.700 --> 01:09:35.860]   It's created the Swift Sandbox, which is an online service for free that you can go to right
[01:09:35.860 --> 01:09:39.180]   Swift code, compile and run it.
[01:09:39.180 --> 01:09:40.180]   It's not quite the playground.
[01:09:40.180 --> 01:09:43.340]   In fact, the playground is not available in the open source version of Swift.
[01:09:43.340 --> 01:09:44.620]   Can you repel it?
[01:09:44.620 --> 01:09:46.620]   It's basically a repel.
[01:09:46.620 --> 01:09:50.620]   You can run code directly.
[01:09:50.620 --> 01:09:54.620]   Here I'll do the hello world, which it doesn't...
[01:09:54.620 --> 01:09:55.620]   I can't get back to that.
[01:09:55.620 --> 01:09:56.620]   I loaded it up.
[01:09:56.620 --> 01:09:59.620]   When you first load it up, it loads hello world, which is just a couple of lines of coding.
[01:09:59.620 --> 01:10:03.620]   You click the run button and you can see the output immediately, which is very cool.
[01:10:03.620 --> 01:10:06.620]   It's an Apache license too, which is fairly permissive.
[01:10:06.620 --> 01:10:08.620]   Yeah, that's a good license.
[01:10:08.620 --> 01:10:10.620]   No problem with the Apache license.
[01:10:10.620 --> 01:10:13.620]   I hope more people take it.
[01:10:13.620 --> 01:10:15.620]   Somebody just said 9.2 is out.
[01:10:15.620 --> 01:10:16.620]   How does that right?
[01:10:16.620 --> 01:10:17.620]   Yep.
[01:10:17.620 --> 01:10:18.620]   9.2, watch OS 2.1.
[01:10:18.620 --> 01:10:21.620]   Oh, it's 10.11.2.
[01:10:21.620 --> 01:10:23.620]   Everything dropped like that.
[01:10:23.620 --> 01:10:24.620]   9.1.
[01:10:24.620 --> 01:10:27.620]   I was typing in updates to the show.
[01:10:27.620 --> 01:10:29.620]   It was like five minutes after two o'clock.
[01:10:29.620 --> 01:10:31.620]   I'm trying to think about it.
[01:10:31.620 --> 01:10:32.620]   What's your thoughts on this?
[01:10:32.620 --> 01:10:33.620]   Should we do it?
[01:10:33.620 --> 01:10:34.620]   Is it safe?
[01:10:34.620 --> 01:10:38.140]   I don't know if it's safe, but they've added a whole bunch of stuff that people have been
[01:10:38.140 --> 01:10:41.620]   expecting for a long, long time, like on TVOS.
[01:10:41.620 --> 01:10:45.580]   Now, for instance, the remote apps work fine, so you know you can control it from your iPhone.
[01:10:45.580 --> 01:10:49.580]   For people who are frustrated with how difficult it is to keep typing in passwords, you can.
[01:10:49.580 --> 01:10:53.580]   There's no Bluetooth support for keyboards, but you can use the on-screen keyboard now
[01:10:53.580 --> 01:10:56.580]   in the remote app, of course, because now the remote app is compatible.
[01:10:56.580 --> 01:11:03.580]   They added stuff like a Siri voice search for music on the TV is now enabled.
[01:11:03.580 --> 01:11:10.580]   On iOS, one of the nicest things I've been waiting for for a long time for Apple music is they
[01:11:10.580 --> 01:11:16.580]   now, if there is a song or a track or playlist that is on your device, you get a little phone
[01:11:16.580 --> 01:11:22.580]   icon with a checkbox next to that list item to tell you visually this song is actually
[01:11:22.580 --> 01:11:23.580]   on your device.
[01:11:23.580 --> 01:11:25.580]   It's not streaming from the cloud.
[01:11:25.580 --> 01:11:31.580]   So if you go, if you board a plane with it, you are not going to be listening to an air entertainment
[01:11:31.580 --> 01:11:32.580]   channel three.
[01:11:32.580 --> 01:11:35.580]   And it's easier to add to create playlists.
[01:11:35.580 --> 01:11:39.580]   A lot of really nice little refinements and most of them are of the well, duh, how come you
[01:11:39.580 --> 01:11:41.580]   didn't, how come you didn't ship with this?
[01:11:41.580 --> 01:11:43.580]   It's very, very welcome improvement.
[01:11:43.580 --> 01:11:44.580]   How big is it?
[01:11:44.580 --> 01:11:45.580]   I didn't mind during the show.
[01:11:45.580 --> 01:11:46.580]   It turned out fine.
[01:11:46.580 --> 01:11:47.580]   I had no problems with it.
[01:11:47.580 --> 01:11:50.580]   It seems like it's coming very fast and it's not very big.
[01:11:50.580 --> 01:11:53.580]   Because I already downloaded it.
[01:11:53.580 --> 01:11:56.580]   I mean, that's a few minutes over Wi-Fi for me.
[01:11:56.580 --> 01:11:59.580]   Yeah, but I think it's, I wish I could find the size.
[01:11:59.580 --> 01:12:00.580]   I don't think they say it.
[01:12:00.580 --> 01:12:01.580]   Usually I could find that somewhere.
[01:12:01.580 --> 01:12:02.580]   Does it usually on the first screen?
[01:12:02.580 --> 01:12:04.580]   Yeah, it's not right now.
[01:12:04.580 --> 01:12:06.580]   But I don't think it's like a gigabyte.
[01:12:06.580 --> 01:12:09.580]   Apple should be embarrassed about music.
[01:12:09.580 --> 01:12:12.580]   272 megabytes.
[01:12:12.580 --> 01:12:14.580]   It's tiny.
[01:12:14.580 --> 01:12:15.580]   So it's a vector.
[01:12:15.580 --> 01:12:17.580]   It's a delta.
[01:12:17.580 --> 01:12:18.580]   Delta, yeah.
[01:12:18.580 --> 01:12:21.580]   Watch OS.
[01:12:21.580 --> 01:12:23.580]   What's new there?
[01:12:23.580 --> 01:12:28.580]   Bug fixes and language support, particularly for languages that don't go from left to right.
[01:12:28.580 --> 01:12:33.580]   They've also added serious support for, again, languages that aren't Western languages.
[01:12:33.580 --> 01:12:39.580]   So a lot of Arabic languages, a lot of, I'm going for the listen for me.
[01:12:39.580 --> 01:12:43.580]   But a lot of international support, a lot of bug fixes.
[01:12:43.580 --> 01:12:52.580]   I can't remember if it has actual features that people who in America who use the English stuff would actually use.
[01:12:52.580 --> 01:12:56.580]   I can't remember Apple ever updating every product that they have at the same time.
[01:12:56.580 --> 01:13:00.580]   Somebody wants to go home for Christmas or for the holidays early.
[01:13:00.580 --> 01:13:02.580]   They do close everything down for the holidays.
[01:13:02.580 --> 01:13:03.580]   It's December.
[01:13:03.580 --> 01:13:04.580]   They should stop.
[01:13:04.580 --> 01:13:09.580]   Somebody, Jim said actually triggered, like Jim was just talking about Apple Music for a second.
[01:13:09.580 --> 01:13:13.580]   And it occurs to me there's this theme going around because Jim is a power Apple music user.
[01:13:13.580 --> 01:13:14.580]   And it's been a horrible forum.
[01:13:14.580 --> 01:13:15.580]   I just use serial play stuff.
[01:13:15.580 --> 01:13:17.580]   And it's been fantastic for me.
[01:13:17.580 --> 01:13:26.580]   People who have big collections of media on Drobo's or other devices, they're really upset with Apple TV because it stops some forms of MP4 from working.
[01:13:26.580 --> 01:13:29.580]   And the whole map is still, like the computers app is still a mess.
[01:13:29.580 --> 01:13:31.580]   And they really can't access their collections.
[01:13:31.580 --> 01:13:32.580]   They just use it as stream stuff.
[01:13:32.580 --> 01:13:33.580]   So I'm fine.
[01:13:33.580 --> 01:13:36.580]   Brent Simmons just did a post about his father's ongoing issues with mail.
[01:13:36.580 --> 01:13:37.580]   And he's a super intelligent guy.
[01:13:37.580 --> 01:13:39.580]   And mail just won't work.
[01:13:39.580 --> 01:13:43.580]   John Gruber and Matt trans were talking about how things just won't sink.
[01:13:43.580 --> 01:13:46.580]   Like you put in a text shortcut and it just doesn't sink.
[01:13:46.580 --> 01:13:50.580]   And we've gotten past this time where things either work or they don't work.
[01:13:50.580 --> 01:13:54.580]   But like the more you use a product, it looks like the more pain you're getting from that product.
[01:13:54.580 --> 01:13:55.580]   Yeah.
[01:13:55.580 --> 01:13:57.580]   Well, I'm not updating it.
[01:13:57.580 --> 01:14:03.580]   My music doesn't sink between my Mac and my iOS device.
[01:14:03.580 --> 01:14:12.580]   I mean, Apple music today updated the fact that you could download and make available offline your music.
[01:14:12.580 --> 01:14:17.580]   We're five months in and they're just getting around to this now.
[01:14:17.580 --> 01:14:20.580]   A few weeks ago, I went on a trip.
[01:14:20.580 --> 01:14:26.580]   I downloaded all of my guns and roses for a short flight.
[01:14:26.580 --> 01:14:32.580]   And I get on the plane, hit airplane mode, eight songs out of a hundred actually downloaded.
[01:14:32.580 --> 01:14:35.580]   So Apple is finally getting to this now.
[01:14:35.580 --> 01:14:43.580]   So when I get to where I was going, in order to make sure that I had music for the flight home,
[01:14:43.580 --> 01:14:49.580]   I downloaded Google Play, subscribed, downloaded my music and it worked flawlessly.
[01:14:49.580 --> 01:14:54.580]   Yeah, you look at Apple TV. They updated, updated Apple TV today. I haven't tried this yet.
[01:14:54.580 --> 01:15:00.580]   But when Apple TV first came out, I went to Apple music and added a song.
[01:15:00.580 --> 01:15:02.580]   Sure. Okay. You can add a song. No problem.
[01:15:02.580 --> 01:15:10.580]   Then I went to that album and it looks like I have the whole album, you know, added to my music when I don't.
[01:15:10.580 --> 01:15:12.580]   I only have one song.
[01:15:12.580 --> 01:15:21.580]   So I go to remove that album or that song, you know, when you press the button and it comes up with this screen and says remove from my library.
[01:15:21.580 --> 01:15:27.580]   I press that button a hundred times and nothing happens. So then I go to cancel and the song is there.
[01:15:27.580 --> 01:15:31.580]   It's like Apple wants me to have this song. No, I don't want that song.
[01:15:31.580 --> 01:15:37.580]   So now I'm going to go out as soon as we're done here and try that and see if that bug is fixed.
[01:15:37.580 --> 01:15:40.580]   But there's so many bugs, so many bugs.
[01:15:40.580 --> 01:15:44.580]   Well, at worst, they're different for different people. So it's very hard to predict what's going to happen.
[01:15:44.580 --> 01:15:53.580]   And the last time Apple had this many bugs in an app, they wrote an apology letter and that was with maps.
[01:15:53.580 --> 01:15:54.580]   Yeah.
[01:15:54.580 --> 01:16:03.580]   So I don't know what they're doing here. I mean, I added Led Zeppelin I and Led Zeppelin II to Apple music on my Mac on my Mac.
[01:16:03.580 --> 01:16:10.580]   It changed the names of them to Led Zeppelin mothership, both of them, both albums, even though they're different albums.
[01:16:10.580 --> 01:16:15.580]   But on my iOS devices, they were still Led Zeppelin I and II.
[01:16:15.580 --> 01:16:16.580]   What?
[01:16:16.580 --> 01:16:22.580]   I thought that my account's same. I thought that the Mac and iOS talk to each other.
[01:16:22.580 --> 01:16:25.580]   They're the same. Yeah. Apparently they don't.
[01:16:25.580 --> 01:16:35.580]   Yeah. You know, I'm very angry with Apple music just because I care so much about my music and I care.
[01:16:35.580 --> 01:16:43.580]   I believe in Apple. I believe that what they do is I think that they do great things. They innovate.
[01:16:43.580 --> 01:16:50.580]   What they've done with Apple music is not innovation. They're playing catch up and they're not even doing it right.
[01:16:50.580 --> 01:16:58.580]   And I'm guessing that the fact that it increased the match limit on Apple iTunes match to 100,000 tracks is not going to change your.
[01:16:58.580 --> 01:17:01.580]   I don't care. But I want them to fix the problems.
[01:17:01.580 --> 01:17:05.580]   Yeah, I think it works. I want them to stick 100 tracks right. Yeah.
[01:17:05.580 --> 01:17:11.580]   Yeah. Get 10 tracks right. I mean, we're five months into this.
[01:17:11.580 --> 01:17:23.580]   And I can't even add music to the library and keep in mind that I'm not asking Apple music to do anything that Apple didn't tell me it could do.
[01:17:23.580 --> 01:17:29.580]   That's that I'm not saying that Apple should do this great wonderful thing that it can't do.
[01:17:29.580 --> 01:17:35.580]   They told me it could do this. I'm just asking it to do it. And it can't.
[01:17:35.580 --> 01:17:44.580]   Yeah. And it seems to me like the larger thing problem. Like, again, I have text replacement shortcuts on my iPhone on my Mac. They're mostly the same.
[01:17:44.580 --> 01:17:49.580]   I just installed my iPad Pro. I look in the text replacements are empty and there's no button that says, "Resync them."
[01:17:49.580 --> 01:17:54.580]   There's no like sometimes if you go to iCloud and you reauthenticate, it'll re-kick all the same services, but not always.
[01:17:54.580 --> 01:18:00.580]   And I don't know how to do it otherwise. So there's this and the big joke is that Apple's never been good at cloud services.
[01:18:00.580 --> 01:18:07.580]   But at a certain point, it can't be a joke anymore. It has to be something that they're deadly serious on a cultural level with fixing and things that you're not good at.
[01:18:07.580 --> 01:18:16.580]   It feels as though when Apple built iCloud, they used like inferior counterfeit Chinese steel.
[01:18:16.580 --> 01:18:22.580]   And because the entire thing has been built from this thing, it means that they can't ever fix it without tearing it down and starting all over again.
[01:18:22.580 --> 01:18:24.580]   Well, do it. Then tear it down.
[01:18:24.580 --> 01:18:29.580]   They had to tear this music down.
[01:18:29.580 --> 01:18:37.580]   I mean, I would be very, very pleased if Apple did that. They simply said that we appreciate we've got a very serious problem here.
[01:18:37.580 --> 01:18:43.580]   We are going to pull back for a second and restart. We're going to have Apple music is still going on. It's going to work great.
[01:18:43.580 --> 01:18:49.580]   But please realize that we are capable of saying that we bought a load of tainted meat.
[01:18:49.580 --> 01:18:54.580]   Please don't buy the beef burritos anymore because those are tainted products.
[01:18:54.580 --> 01:18:59.580]   We will have non tainted products out in the shelves soon enough and we're not hearing that from Apple yet.
[01:18:59.580 --> 01:19:07.580]   See, right. All I ask is that they do what they said that they could do. And, you know, they're just not.
[01:19:07.580 --> 01:19:17.580]   And, you know, every once in a while, we see an update. I have no idea of this update that comes out today actually fixes anything or it doesn't.
[01:19:17.580 --> 01:19:26.580]   The last time they released updates for Apple music and well, I guess some of them did get fixed. Some of the bugs did get fixed.
[01:19:26.580 --> 01:19:29.580]   But, you know, the bugs just continue.
[01:19:29.580 --> 01:19:42.580]   And I believe in what Apple says, I believe in what Tim Cook says. And as a company, I believe that what they do is great.
[01:19:42.580 --> 01:19:50.580]   And that's what upsets me about Apple music, that it's not great. It's not even mediocre.
[01:19:50.580 --> 01:19:52.580]   You know, that's what I just.
[01:19:52.580 --> 01:20:02.580]   It's amazing to think that there's a critical piece of Apple infrastructure. There's an app that is so important to Apple that it comes pre-installed in the dock of every iOS device.
[01:20:02.580 --> 01:20:07.580]   And it's an app that I'm every time I as a consumer, I think whatever you do, you have a brand new iPad Pro and it's great.
[01:20:07.580 --> 01:20:12.580]   But whatever you do, don't introduce it to music.
[01:20:12.580 --> 01:20:16.580]   I download the Amazon MP3 app.
[01:20:16.580 --> 01:20:30.580]   It's a little bit, it has the right idea, kind of the same way that Google music has where I like the idea that it almost decides it's almost designed to be two different music players under the same icon and an on-device music player and a streaming music player.
[01:20:30.580 --> 01:20:36.580]   And it's always absolutely explicit to you and to itself about what it means to do any one given moment.
[01:20:36.580 --> 01:20:43.580]   And I have never surprised myself by not having something on that device that I thought was going to be on that device.
[01:20:43.580 --> 01:20:50.580]   Audio passing away. What would be your choice then as a replacement? I take it not Apple music.
[01:20:50.580 --> 01:20:56.580]   This is, I mean, sad because it's a great opportunity to snarf up a bunch of audio users.
[01:20:56.580 --> 01:21:02.580]   I think the choice is already there. I mean, Pandora has their intellectual property.
[01:21:02.580 --> 01:21:10.580]   And Pandora is basically going to turn themselves from a radio only to radio and on-demand.
[01:21:10.580 --> 01:21:11.580]   Wait till they do that.
[01:21:11.580 --> 01:21:20.580]   Yeah, I mean, you know, and Pandora's radio service is the best on the market, better than Spotify, much better than Apple music.
[01:21:20.580 --> 01:21:26.580]   Have you tried the Google now that Songza has been absorbed by Google? Have you tried the Google stuff?
[01:21:26.580 --> 01:21:27.580]   Yeah. Yeah.
[01:21:27.580 --> 01:21:31.580]   Yeah. I downloaded the app to make sure I have music for the way home.
[01:21:31.580 --> 01:21:32.580]   Right.
[01:21:32.580 --> 01:21:35.580]   You know, and the Google app is great.
[01:21:35.580 --> 01:21:36.580]   Yeah.
[01:21:36.580 --> 01:21:43.580]   You know, that's that kind of stuff. The ball, I should not have to go to another service just to download my own music.
[01:21:43.580 --> 01:21:45.580]   I shouldn't have to do that.
[01:21:45.580 --> 01:21:49.580]   Well, this is what we were talking about at the beginning of the show, which is, seems like now in order for everything to work.
[01:21:49.580 --> 01:21:53.580]   You have to choose a side. But once you've chosen a side, you don't have that option.
[01:21:53.580 --> 01:21:54.580]   Right.
[01:21:54.580 --> 01:22:03.580]   You know, you're kind of all in or nothing. And I think it's a lot to ask of a company to have expertise in every area.
[01:22:03.580 --> 01:22:07.580]   Again, that's what they're promising.
[01:22:07.580 --> 01:22:14.580]   Then, exactly. Then don't tell me that you can do it. If they had to come out and said, "Look, we're going to try this.
[01:22:14.580 --> 01:22:17.580]   We're not really sure if we can do it or not."
[01:22:17.580 --> 01:22:22.580]   But here's a beta. And let's see how this goes.
[01:22:22.580 --> 01:22:28.580]   Okay. Great. You know, no problem at all. Let's try this beta. That's not what they said.
[01:22:28.580 --> 01:22:37.580]   I'm a fan of Google Play at this point, especially because of the YouTube red that comes along for the ride, the ad-free versions of YouTube, the YouTube music.
[01:22:37.580 --> 01:22:39.580]   They have a good collection. I like their software.
[01:22:39.580 --> 01:22:42.580]   My biggest concern is that the independent companies won't be able to survive the razor thin.
[01:22:42.580 --> 01:22:43.580]   They're not really hard business.
[01:22:43.580 --> 01:22:47.580]   It's going to be Google and Apple and the big Amazon.
[01:22:47.580 --> 01:22:49.580]   It's going to be Google and Apple and Microsoft and Amazon.
[01:22:49.580 --> 01:22:51.580]   Yeah. And maybe not Microsoft only because they don't care.
[01:22:51.580 --> 01:22:58.580]   I think it's tough even for Pandora because the record companies squeeze them and can squeeze them as hard as they want.
[01:22:58.580 --> 01:23:04.580]   I like Spotify a lot. I would be sad if Spotify could not make a living.
[01:23:04.580 --> 01:23:09.580]   Yeah. I just want to find the biggest at this point. They're the guys.
[01:23:09.580 --> 01:23:12.580]   They have no other money to help them to fry costs of crazy music.
[01:23:12.580 --> 01:23:15.580]   Right. Exactly. Exactly.
[01:23:15.580 --> 01:23:21.580]   You, I mean, we, you know, ask Michael Roberts, the founder of MP3.com what the music industry is willing to do.
[01:23:21.580 --> 01:23:27.580]   You know, let's take a little break. We want to get Jim out of here at a timely fashion.
[01:23:27.580 --> 01:23:34.580]   Our show today brought to you by Braintree. Braintree, it makes payments easy. They have licked it.
[01:23:34.580 --> 01:23:39.580]   They started originally as a, as a web e-commerce solution.
[01:23:39.580 --> 01:23:45.580]   Moved to mobile very early on and now they are the number one for mobile payments.
[01:23:45.580 --> 01:23:49.580]   They make mobile payments fast, easy, seamless. It's, it's almost magical.
[01:23:49.580 --> 01:23:54.580]   In fact, you know, because you've used it. What? You say, Leo, I don't remember using Braintree.
[01:23:54.580 --> 01:24:00.580]   Oh, yes, you did. Have you ever used an Uber? Yeah. That payment system, you know, you get out of the car and everything's handled.
[01:24:00.580 --> 01:24:07.580]   That's a, that's a Braintree lift. Same thing. Airbnb ever paid for anything there? Yep. Same thing.
[01:24:07.580 --> 01:24:09.580]   Hotels tonight. Braintree.
[01:24:09.580 --> 01:24:14.580]   GitHub is Braintree. Now, if you're a developer and you've not used GitHub, well, I don't know.
[01:24:14.580 --> 01:24:21.580]   I'm presuming that somewhere you've used Braintree. How about Pinterest's buyable pins? That's Braintree.
[01:24:21.580 --> 01:24:27.580]   What's great about Braintree is they make it easy for the people using your app to, to give you money.
[01:24:27.580 --> 01:24:31.580]   Now, that's what you want. You don't want them to, you want them to be comfortable.
[01:24:31.580 --> 01:24:36.580]   They want it to be the experience to be transparent and you want your customers to be able to use any form of payment they want.
[01:24:36.580 --> 01:24:42.580]   Apple Pay, Android Pay, PayPal, Venmo, credit cards, Bitcoin. Yes, Bitcoin.
[01:24:42.580 --> 01:24:46.580]   And if some other way to pay comes along, Braintree will support that too.
[01:24:46.580 --> 01:24:52.580]   For you fast payouts, continuous support, superior fraud protection.
[01:24:52.580 --> 01:24:59.580]   You'll see fewer abandoned carts, more sales with Braintree, best in class, best in class mobile checkout experience.
[01:24:59.580 --> 01:25:03.580]   And it scales right along with you from your first dollar to your billionth.
[01:25:03.580 --> 01:25:09.580]   It's a full stack payment solution. Easy integration for you.
[01:25:09.580 --> 01:25:14.580]   Trans cross platform in every way. I just, you know, it's the best.
[01:25:14.580 --> 01:25:18.580]   Go try it. They have a sandbox, braintreatpayments.com/macbreak
[01:25:18.580 --> 01:25:30.580]   and as a little incentive, your first $50,000 in transactions will be fee free as long as you go to braintreatpayments.com/macbreak.
[01:25:30.580 --> 01:25:35.580]   Pics of the week. Let's start with you, Jim Dowrymple.
[01:25:35.580 --> 01:25:41.580]   Okay. I am going to pick this week, Stone Temple Pilots.
[01:25:41.580 --> 01:25:48.580]   Oh, yes, of course. We have to. Because Scott Whalen died this week.
[01:25:48.580 --> 01:25:51.580]   It's such a sad story. You actually read the Rolling Stone letter from his ex.
[01:25:51.580 --> 01:25:57.580]   Yeah, it's so sad. I love Scott. I think he's an incredible talent.
[01:25:57.580 --> 01:26:02.580]   Was an incredible talent. So Stone Temple Pilots, Velvet Revolver.
[01:26:02.580 --> 01:26:05.580]   And it's going to be a good story.
[01:26:05.580 --> 01:26:12.580]   No, it's interesting because he was always reinventing himself. So it's so it's in. That's the era you think represents him best.
[01:26:12.580 --> 01:26:18.580]   But I mean, he was so, so, so, so talented as a songwriter.
[01:26:18.580 --> 01:26:26.580]   And no matter who he was with, I mean, with the pilots, they, you know, STP had some amazing songs over the years.
[01:26:26.580 --> 01:26:32.580]   But then, you know, in two albums with Velvet Revolver, it just amazing stuff.
[01:26:32.580 --> 01:26:38.580]   So if you haven't heard either of those, of course, Velvet Revolvers with Slash.
[01:26:38.580 --> 01:26:44.580]   If you haven't heard any of those, please go listen. He was great.
[01:26:44.580 --> 01:26:49.580]   There's also a couple of concerts on Quelol, which is on Apple TV.
[01:26:49.580 --> 01:26:54.580]   And one with Stone Temple Pilots, one with Velvet Revolver.
[01:26:54.580 --> 01:27:01.580]   Some just great concerts. The way that that man could move on stage was, yeah, me was so skinny.
[01:27:01.580 --> 01:27:05.580]   You know, but he would be moving around up there. And it was great.
[01:27:05.580 --> 01:27:09.580]   It was kind of like Axel Rose in the old days, you know, the way that Axel would move.
[01:27:09.580 --> 01:27:12.580]   But before he got fat with corn rose. So.
[01:27:12.580 --> 01:27:15.580]   [laughter]
[01:27:15.580 --> 01:27:18.580]   So sad to say Scott didn't get a chance to get fat.
[01:27:18.580 --> 01:27:21.580]   But now Scott didn't. So, yeah.
[01:27:21.580 --> 01:27:30.580]   Good, good pick. I like it. Scott Weiland, any of the eras, but the, the, the Super Group era was, I have to say interesting.
[01:27:30.580 --> 01:27:36.580]   Great music. And you've heard all of us. You've actually heard a lot of it on the radio, even though he didn't have a huge number of hits.
[01:27:36.580 --> 01:27:39.580]   Radio played a lot of STF.
[01:27:39.580 --> 01:27:43.580]   Thank you, Jim. We'll let you go. We made it. One minute to spare.
[01:27:43.580 --> 01:27:46.580]   Thank you. Loop insight.com.
[01:27:46.580 --> 01:27:49.580]   Do not fear this beard.
[01:27:49.580 --> 01:27:52.580]   Thank you, Jim. See you soon.
[01:27:52.580 --> 01:27:54.580]   Happy holidays, Jim. Happy holidays, yeah.
[01:27:54.580 --> 01:27:57.580]   Yeah. Hope to see you before the holidays.
[01:27:57.580 --> 01:28:01.580]   Are you going somewhere for Christmas? No. No.
[01:28:01.580 --> 01:28:02.580]   Stay at home. Yeah.
[01:28:02.580 --> 01:28:05.580]   It's warm there. Why is he going to move? Yes. Stay right where you are.
[01:28:05.580 --> 01:28:08.580]   All right, Jim. Take care. See you guys.
[01:28:08.580 --> 01:28:11.580]   Renee Richie, I'm more.com. Your pick of the week.
[01:28:11.580 --> 01:28:16.580]   So I'm picking, it's something that is both old and new. It's Apple's lightning to SD card reader.
[01:28:16.580 --> 01:28:21.580]   And the big deal here is with iOS 9.2 on the iPhone. It also works with the iPhone now.
[01:28:21.580 --> 01:28:28.580]   Finally. Yeah, giant, finally, with like marquee and blink tags on either side of it.
[01:28:28.580 --> 01:28:34.580]   It originally launched with the iPad. It was a great way when you were on the go to take out the SD card from your, from your, you know, traditional camera.
[01:28:34.580 --> 01:28:39.580]   Stick it. I'm calling an SD card traditional. This is how far we've come from your regular camera.
[01:28:39.580 --> 01:28:44.580]   Put it in there and just suck everything into your iPad. You could edit it on the go.
[01:28:44.580 --> 01:28:50.580]   But now the iPhones are so powerful and they've got such good software on them that a lot of people have really wanted to be able to import photos into the iPhone and use that.
[01:28:50.580 --> 01:28:55.580]   Instead, because it's one less thing to carry around. And now you can do it just as easily. You buy the adapter.
[01:28:55.580 --> 01:29:02.580]   I believe the adapter is physically the same. So if you have the original one, you should be able to just update iOS 9.2 and start using it.
[01:29:02.580 --> 01:29:13.580]   And you put it in there, pull movies off, pull photos off, bring them into your iPhone, use them in iMovie, process them in photos or Google's photos or everyone who's got photos as the same name of their product now.
[01:29:13.580 --> 01:29:21.580]   And it's just, it's incredibly convenient, especially on an iPhone 6S Plus that is such so powerful a chipset and so much screen space.
[01:29:21.580 --> 01:29:25.580]   It's just, for me, it makes mobile much, much more fun.
[01:29:25.580 --> 01:29:26.580]   So happy with it.
[01:29:26.580 --> 01:29:32.580]   I'm glad it works again. I was always puzzled. It works on the iPad too, because I've had trouble with it.
[01:29:32.580 --> 01:29:33.580]   It's always worked on the iPad.
[01:29:33.580 --> 01:29:37.580]   At least for me, it's always worked on the iPhone. It's always been marked as compatible with the iPad.
[01:29:37.580 --> 01:29:40.580]   And it works great. I think Srinarit was doing all our editing on the iPad Pro with it.
[01:29:40.580 --> 01:29:42.580]   I know, I want it for the iPad Pro.
[01:29:42.580 --> 01:29:47.580]   By the way, the new one is supposedly, if you use it with the iPad Pro, you're going to get USB 3 speeds, which is cool.
[01:29:47.580 --> 01:30:00.580]   The iPad Pro, so the biggest problem with USB speeds on the iPhone, on iOS devices traditionally is that they didn't have PCI architecture and they didn't have NAND flash memory that could write at anything approaching USB 3 speeds.
[01:30:00.580 --> 01:30:02.580]   So it didn't really matter how fast the cable was.
[01:30:02.580 --> 01:30:06.580]   It just sort of mattered how fast they could do I/O and they couldn't do it fast. So there's no point.
[01:30:06.580 --> 01:30:11.580]   Now they've got this whole new storage controller, which is very similar to a MacBook controller, super super fast.
[01:30:11.580 --> 01:30:16.580]   And they got PCI architecture, so it makes you start to wonder could they even get like thunderbolt speeds out of it if they wanted to eventually.
[01:30:16.580 --> 01:30:20.580]   But yeah, for sure, all they need now is the lightning cable is still USB 2.
[01:30:20.580 --> 01:30:24.580]   So we need a physical lightning cable that's USB 3 and we should be very, very happy.
[01:30:24.580 --> 01:30:28.580]   But they do make an SD card reader now that gives you that full speed.
[01:30:28.580 --> 01:30:33.580]   So when you get, I might get a new one. In other words, it's worth getting a new one.
[01:30:33.580 --> 01:30:40.580]   Yep, and it says right in the description, it supports data transfer up to USB 3 speeds on iPad Pro up to USB 2 speeds on everything.
[01:30:40.580 --> 01:30:44.580]   Nice. Oh, I suspect the new iPhones could be driven faster. We'll have to find out.
[01:30:44.580 --> 01:30:47.580]   Mr. Ennio, you're picking the week.
[01:30:47.580 --> 01:30:55.580]   Quick reminder that Monument Valley, that wonderful game that everyone was talking about earlier this year is free for iOS,
[01:30:55.580 --> 01:31:02.580]   but it stops being free at midnight tonight. So if you're listening live, definitely go snag yourself a free copy because it's a great, great game.
[01:31:02.580 --> 01:31:06.580]   Really? But my other pick is another old, but new again.
[01:31:06.580 --> 01:31:11.580]   It's notability for the iPad, which has been around for the iPad for a long, long, long time.
[01:31:11.580 --> 01:31:18.580]   I've just never really liked it because there's never been a good way to, good thing for my hand to take notes in.
[01:31:18.580 --> 01:31:24.580]   The way I take notes is by, you know, it's a really fast con between my brain and my hand.
[01:31:24.580 --> 01:31:31.580]   And if I'm waiting for, if there's a lag between the pencil and the pen and the screen, or things are not working the way,
[01:31:31.580 --> 01:31:35.580]   then I'm manipulating an object instead of just doing a free flow of ideas.
[01:31:35.580 --> 01:31:42.580]   But the pencil is so fast that, as a matter of fact, the last thing I did before writing my iPad review was actually right out.
[01:31:42.580 --> 01:31:43.580]   Look at that.
[01:31:43.580 --> 01:31:51.580]   Because I had so many ideas and was the first draft was breaking down into about $5,000, $6,000, $7,000 words,
[01:31:51.580 --> 01:31:54.580]   and I knew that was way too long for what I wanted to do.
[01:31:54.580 --> 01:32:00.580]   And the only way to simplify it was to put the draft aside, get out, use the analog portion of my brain,
[01:32:00.580 --> 01:32:03.580]   and then just remember what I wanted to say, write it out like that.
[01:32:03.580 --> 01:32:07.580]   And the great thing about taking notes is that, like you can see, it's not all like bullet item text.
[01:32:07.580 --> 01:32:12.580]   Sometimes you remember writing something later on, as you remember something earlier,
[01:32:12.580 --> 01:32:14.580]   and sometimes there are different ways of describing things.
[01:32:14.580 --> 01:32:19.580]   And you're also taking notes on a sheet of 8.5 by 11 paper.
[01:32:19.580 --> 01:32:27.580]   And so it was just, I solved all those editing problems, like in about 15 minutes of just writing two pages of notes on what I want to say
[01:32:27.580 --> 01:32:29.580]   and how I want to say it.
[01:32:29.580 --> 01:32:31.580]   And it really is remarkable.
[01:32:31.580 --> 01:32:36.580]   I've been using it a lot over the past week just for that reason.
[01:32:36.580 --> 01:32:42.580]   And it's just a good indication, a good demonstration of, here's what happens when you take an existing app.
[01:32:42.580 --> 01:32:46.580]   It's updated, of course, for iOS 9, iOS 9, it's not as though it's the old app.
[01:32:46.580 --> 01:32:54.580]   But when you just put it in a larger form factor and add a pencil to it, for some people it just becomes a transformative new app.
[01:32:54.580 --> 01:32:58.580]   It's absolutely lovely. And it's not just for handwritten notes.
[01:32:58.580 --> 01:33:05.580]   It can also, as you're in a meeting, it can record all the noise in the room while you're taking notes
[01:33:05.580 --> 01:33:10.580]   so that you will have a full recording of what people were talking about, plus the notes that you were taking.
[01:33:10.580 --> 01:33:16.580]   You can export stuff, you can import color, you can import pictures, you can have photos in this notebook, as I say.
[01:33:16.580 --> 01:33:21.580]   There are other notes app for that the Apple ships is good.
[01:33:21.580 --> 01:33:28.580]   And the other note is really, really good. This is the app that really tries to be a sheet of paper that you put ink on.
[01:33:28.580 --> 01:33:32.580]   And it's the most successful of all the ones that I tried. So, best six bucks I spent.
[01:33:32.580 --> 01:33:37.580]   Good. Yeah, I own it. But I'm just downloading it now again.
[01:33:37.580 --> 01:33:42.580]   Does Omni Grafel support the pencil? What other kind of design and note and mind?
[01:33:42.580 --> 01:33:45.580]   I would love a mind mapping app that supported the pencil.
[01:33:45.580 --> 01:33:48.580]   Haven't tried them yet. I'd be surprised if it didn't.
[01:33:48.580 --> 01:33:54.580]   The Omni Outliner, for instance, has the most ambitious keyboard support I've seen in an iOS app.
[01:33:54.580 --> 01:33:58.580]   It flies in the iPad Pro. So, if it doesn't do a pencil, it'd be really surprising.
[01:33:58.580 --> 01:34:01.580]   It'll be supporting it soon, I know.
[01:34:01.580 --> 01:34:04.580]   Yeah. Love notability.
[01:34:04.580 --> 01:34:11.580]   Hey, we're out of time. This was fun. And I'm updating all of my hardware.
[01:34:11.580 --> 01:34:14.580]   So, I can't really show you anything.
[01:34:14.580 --> 01:34:19.580]   I was going to, and maybe I will, I was going to mention, I've, because this is such a narrow market.
[01:34:19.580 --> 01:34:23.580]   But Chris Markwort has talked me into buying a film camera.
[01:34:23.580 --> 01:34:26.580]   In fact, I bought such an old film camera. It's as old as me.
[01:34:26.580 --> 01:34:31.580]   I bought a film camera my age, like an M3, and it has no light meter on it.
[01:34:31.580 --> 01:34:35.580]   But here's the good news. Your iPhone does.
[01:34:35.580 --> 01:34:39.580]   This is pocket light meter. Chris Markwort, remember, recommended it.
[01:34:39.580 --> 01:34:44.580]   It's a spot meter. You can buy a little add-on for a couple of bucks.
[01:34:44.580 --> 01:34:49.580]   It'll give you a dome over there. It'll make it a more diffused area meter.
[01:34:49.580 --> 01:34:52.580]   You can pick the ISO of the film you're using.
[01:34:52.580 --> 01:34:58.580]   Let's say I'm doing ISO 100. And then you can lock down the shutter speed.
[01:34:58.580 --> 01:35:00.580]   I don't want to ever go slower than a 30th.
[01:35:00.580 --> 01:35:04.580]   So, if I'm taking a picture here, I need to set the aperture to f/2.8.
[01:35:04.580 --> 01:35:08.580]   It's that easy. You can also log it, which is fantastic.
[01:35:08.580 --> 01:35:12.580]   I'm out to Evernote. So, you can have the picture that you took.
[01:35:12.580 --> 01:35:17.580]   This is great. I'm going to use this because my film camera won't really have
[01:35:17.580 --> 01:35:21.580]   ex-if information in the film about where I took the picture or any notes that I want.
[01:35:21.580 --> 01:35:25.580]   But I could put that into my smartphone as I do the meter reading.
[01:35:25.580 --> 01:35:32.580]   And then I can add it and have a record, a log of where I've taken the photos and so forth.
[01:35:32.580 --> 01:35:34.580]   So, this is pretty sweet.
[01:35:34.580 --> 01:35:40.580]   It isn't -- it's free, but if you wanted to buy the developer a pint of beer, $5.99, no ads then.
[01:35:40.580 --> 01:35:44.580]   And I think it's probably worth spending a little bit of money on it.
[01:35:44.580 --> 01:35:48.580]   So, it's pocket, light meter. There's a lot of different ones.
[01:35:48.580 --> 01:35:56.580]   Look for the one with the icon that looks like an old school spot, you know, light meter, incident light meter.
[01:35:56.580 --> 01:35:58.580]   Nice little pick there.
[01:35:58.580 --> 01:36:00.580]   All right.
[01:36:01.580 --> 01:36:06.580]   Annie Inako, Chicago Sun Times. Read him and enjoy him.
[01:36:06.580 --> 01:36:08.580]   Cw.com.
[01:36:08.580 --> 01:36:09.580]   Love him.
[01:36:09.580 --> 01:36:11.580]   Send him money.
[01:36:11.580 --> 01:36:13.580]   Tweet at him, whatever it is.
[01:36:13.580 --> 01:36:14.580]   Oh, money. No.
[01:36:14.580 --> 01:36:15.580]   Love or money.
[01:36:15.580 --> 01:36:16.580]   Definitely money.
[01:36:16.580 --> 01:36:20.580]   I did not have a choice between love and money.
[01:36:20.580 --> 01:36:22.580]   Pick the money.
[01:36:22.580 --> 01:36:23.580]   Which people could love them too.
[01:36:23.580 --> 01:36:25.580]   Send them a gold watch.
[01:36:25.580 --> 01:36:28.580]   Mr. Renee Ritchie, he's at imore.com.
[01:36:28.580 --> 01:36:35.580]   And of course, a great place to go to keep up with Apple News, but also the bestest tutorials and information.
[01:36:35.580 --> 01:36:39.580]   It's 10,000 word review of the iPad Pro and more.
[01:36:39.580 --> 01:36:41.580]   Thank you, Renee. Great to see you again.
[01:36:41.580 --> 01:36:43.580]   Continued warm weather.
[01:36:43.580 --> 01:36:44.580]   Thank you.
[01:36:44.580 --> 01:36:47.580]   In Montreal, I hope you have a great spring.
