[00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.120]   It's time for Macbreak Weekly, the iPad edition, episode 189,
[00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:25.800]   pre-iPhone 4.0, post-IPAD 1.0.
[00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:27.320]   And we've got a great panel of people here
[00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:30.800]   to discuss it starting with Alex Lindsey, who is in Pittsburgh,
[00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:32.120]   PA.
[00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:33.040]   Freeport, actually.
[00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:33.920]   Freeport, Pennsylvania.
[00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:36.520]   I'm coming to you from Salzgiver.
[00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:38.320]   It's an ISP that's here.
[00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:41.360]   And I wanted to make sure I got to a town close enough
[00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:42.600]   to get a good connection.
[00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.280]   Salzgiver sounds like able-skiver.
[00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.440]   Is that a-- it must be a Pennsylvania Dutch word.
[00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:49.520]   I'm not sure what--
[00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:53.240]   Lauren Salzgiver is the-- it's his place.
[00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:55.200]   Ask him if he knows able-skiver.
[00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:55.700]   Yeah.
[00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:56.720]   Just out of curiosity.
[00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:00.880]   Also here, Mr. From Colorado, wearing--
[00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:03.160]   Annie and Akko, what is that cap?
[00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:04.640]   Is that Colorado University?
[00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:05.360]   University of Colorado.
[00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:07.840]   That is the University of Colorado buffaloes, yes?
[00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:10.000]   I try to buy a new one every year of the conference
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:10.640]   on World Affairs.
[00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:12.800]   Because the CU Bookstore, this is the first year in two years.
[00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:14.600]   They've had the fitted wool cap that I like.
[00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:15.720]   So--
[00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:16.520]   Lovely.
[00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:17.040]   I'm a happy guy.
[00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:17.800]   Is that one of those?
[00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:19.200]   Moment except for the lack of oxygen.
[00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.000]   Is that the cap with the Sanzabel built-in,
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.760]   so it fits all sizes?
[00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:24.200]   Or is it actually your hand size?
[00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:24.700]   Yeah.
[00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:27.160]   You have to get it sized for your specific melon.
[00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:30.600]   And what melon sizes are you sporting today?
[00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:32.800]   That would be a 7 and 7/8, sir.
[00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:33.800]   Good lord.
[00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:34.800]   That's why.
[00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:38.320]   That's why I don't wear the one size fits all,
[00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:40.560]   because it's on my head like a yamaka.
[00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:42.600]   There's a lot of juice in that melon.
[00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:44.000]   Holy cow.
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.480]   Same hat size as Jeeves.
[00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:47.840]   Merlin, man, not with us this week.
[00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:50.320]   John Gruber is of daring fireball net.
[00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:52.560]   Great to see you, John.
[00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:53.360]   Great to see you.
[00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:56.160]   And we wanted to get you on on our first iPad show
[00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:59.400]   so that we can see how you feel now that it's out.
[00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:03.720]   And the unicorn tears are thoroughly sprinkled.
[00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:07.840]   Also with us from Macworld Magazine, the Mac Daddy,
[00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:10.320]   the font of all knowledge, Mr. Christopher Brin.
[00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:11.320]   Hello, Chris.
[00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:14.800]   Senior editor at Macworld.com.
[00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:15.560]   Nice to see you.
[00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:16.560]   Nice to see you all.
[00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:17.360]   Look at that.
[00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:18.760]   Full panel today.
[00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:21.440]   Everybody, hold up your iPads.
[00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:25.120]   Now, here's the question.
[00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:26.760]   Andy, you don't have one?
[00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:27.120]   Other.
[00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:27.840]   OK.
[00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:28.920]   Here's the question.
[00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:29.920]   That's a fake one.
[00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:33.080]   Are we sad that we don't have the 3G?
[00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:36.280]   Or are we suckers that we bought the Wi-Fi?
[00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:41.000]   John Gruber, do you feel like you should have bought the Wi-Fi?
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.320]   If I were a regular consumer, I think
[00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:45.800]   I probably would have waited for the Wi-Fi.
[00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:47.200]   But I really felt like--
[00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:50.640]   I mean, I don't get a review unit from Apple.
[00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:52.520]   So you know, crimey at a river.
[00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:56.080]   But if I'm on the right about it now, I need to buy it now.
[00:03:56.080 --> 00:04:00.320]   And I figured right on day one, I was talking to a friend
[00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:02.960]   right outside the line, right after I talked to you guys
[00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:05.160]   outside the line when we were waiting to go in.
[00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:07.120]   When we didn't even know if there would be 3G,
[00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:08.320]   they hadn't made the announcement yet.
[00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:10.040]   But we kind of figured there'd be both.
[00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:13.320]   And it just seems like you could buy one now.
[00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:15.920]   And if you really want the 3G in a month or six weeks,
[00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:18.840]   I mean, the resale value on these ought to be relatively high.
[00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:22.560]   I could probably sell it for, I don't know, $100 off.
[00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:23.560]   Think?
[00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:24.040]   I don't.
[00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:25.440]   I mean, if you sell it to someone overseas,
[00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:28.960]   some of them are going for as high as $5,500 on line.
[00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:30.000]   You're kidding.
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:31.640]   Yeah, but that's not going to hold up by the time
[00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:33.360]   the 3G comes up.
[00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:35.560]   And then the other thing, too, is it seems like--
[00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:37.880]   and just having been home for the weekend for the holiday,
[00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:42.360]   for Easter, it seems like a lot of my relatives
[00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:44.960]   would be pretty happy to have it as a gift.
[00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:46.040]   Take it off your hands.
[00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:46.880]   Yeah.
[00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:49.360]   Yeah, it has a real good wow factor, doesn't it?
[00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:50.880]   Alex, you were on the plane.
[00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:53.120]   Actually, you and Andy both were on planes.
[00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:55.360]   What kind of the response were you getting?
[00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:58.560]   It was that, well, TSA hadn't seen one yet.
[00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:01.720]   Because I think I got on a couple hours after they released it.
[00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:04.240]   And so of course, they wanted to take a look at it
[00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:05.640]   and play with it for a little while.
[00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:07.720]   And so it goes through as a laptop?
[00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:09.280]   Do you have to take it out of your bag, or is it--
[00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:10.360]   Yeah, they said it was good.
[00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:12.160]   They just said it's pretty much on the x-ray, I guess,
[00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:13.760]   evidently it looks a lot like a Kindle.
[00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:15.960]   They said from their perspective.
[00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:18.000]   So you don't have to take it out of your bag?
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.280]   They said it was probably a good idea to take it out.
[00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:22.280]   I asked them when I went in, and they looked at it.
[00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:23.440]   Well, yeah, they said it was a good idea
[00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:24.880]   because they wanted to fondle it.
[00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:25.960]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:29.880]   But there was a fair bit of commotion on the plane.
[00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:30.360]   What did they do?
[00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:32.680]   They run it back and forth through the x-ray a few times
[00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:34.840]   just to see what it looks like to kind of get the infra--
[00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:36.520]   They've actually done this a couple of times.
[00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:39.960]   I take all kinds of weird gear in my carry-on bags.
[00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:41.360]   And so I'm actually pretty used to it.
[00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:42.640]   I give myself a little extra time
[00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:43.560]   if I'm going to bring something that
[00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:44.920]   doesn't look like everything else that's
[00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:45.880]   gone through the system.
[00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:48.680]   And what they do is they look at the x-ray picture
[00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:50.680]   and then they look at the device again
[00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:53.600]   to kind of gear in their head where things are.
[00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:56.480]   They're seeing all these different colors and all this other stuff
[00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:58.240]   and trying to make sure that they kind of understand
[00:05:58.240 --> 00:05:59.760]   what that actually is.
[00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:01.360]   And so it was pretty reasonable.
[00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:02.320]   They were really nice about it.
[00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:05.280]   They were excited to play with one.
[00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:06.600]   But anyway, so that was it.
[00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:07.920]   And then, of course, everyone on the plane.
[00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:09.440]   I think there were some two kids behind me
[00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:11.400]   that they're stared at me half the plane,
[00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:12.520]   but you finally hit the two of them.
[00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:13.480]   I was like here.
[00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:15.720]   And their review was very good.
[00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:17.920]   They immediately go to the games, of course, right?
[00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:18.680]   Yeah, they play it.
[00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:22.000]   I had the racer--
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:23.400]   I've got a bunch of the games on there.
[00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:26.320]   The racer one was really popular field runners
[00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:31.400]   and obviously, Plants vs. Zombies was very popular among the kids.
[00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:36.400]   So what was it like for you, Andy and not Co?
[00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:39.120]   Well, actually, I've had sort of a Jekyll and Hyde experience
[00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:43.720]   because I took mine out on Thursday on Amtrak,
[00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:45.640]   had was on Amtrak for two hours on the way in
[00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:48.480]   and then two hours on the way back on Friday, like pre-release.
[00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:51.880]   And I barely got any notice whatsoever with it.
[00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:53.880]   I was using it in a window at Starbucks,
[00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:56.040]   like enjoying a coffee, caramelito, latte,
[00:06:56.040 --> 00:06:57.200]   or whatever they have.
[00:06:57.200 --> 00:06:59.200]   That was a little bit more ego boosting
[00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:00.920]   because it's New York City.
[00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:03.600]   People are passing by the window.
[00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:05.120]   Are they pointing and waving?
[00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:07.160]   Pop backwards.
[00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:07.640]   Exactly.
[00:07:07.640 --> 00:07:09.240]   And then I would simply stop what I was doing.
[00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:11.880]   I would hold up the iPad.
[00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:12.400]   That's pretty fun.
[00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:14.480]   I'd hold up my iPad and then rotate it so they could see
[00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:16.480]   that it's actually a real iPad.
[00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:21.160]   And then they'd give me the double Isaac or whatever
[00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:22.640]   and then go on.
[00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:24.640]   But even on the plane ride on the way over here
[00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:27.000]   to Boulder yesterday, not much attention.
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.920]   The difference, though, is the conference on World Affairs,
[00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:31.560]   which is like a week-long conference
[00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:33.400]   of just 100 different people talking
[00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:34.800]   on a bunch of different subjects.
[00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:37.320]   And I just posted something in my blog this morning
[00:07:37.320 --> 00:07:40.320]   that the new informal name for the iPad pod
[00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:42.840]   is Jennifer Connolly's "Brests"
[00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:45.360]   because this is pretty much--
[00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:47.840]   every place I went with this, what they really wanted--
[00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:49.720]   they were happy to see me, but what they really wanted
[00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:52.400]   to see were the thing that I brought with me.
[00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:54.560]   So that's pretty much how that thing went.
[00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:56.720]   Is that Jennifer Connolly's experience as well?
[00:07:56.720 --> 00:07:58.800]   Is that what you're saying?
[00:07:58.800 --> 00:07:59.760]   I could only guess.
[00:07:59.760 --> 00:08:00.360]   It was just like--
[00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:01.360]   Oh!
[00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:02.360]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:03.760]   We're happy to see you, but--
[00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:04.200]   It's like I'm--
[00:08:04.200 --> 00:08:04.880]   whip it out.
[00:08:04.880 --> 00:08:06.200]   Is that what you're saying?
[00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:08.080]   I'm like, holy-- I'm holding the iPad like this,
[00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:12.080]   and I'm using it, and I'm like, my eyes disappear.
[00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:13.920]   Look at my eyes.
[00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:16.880]   Talk to me, not my iPad.
[00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:18.240]   You know, this might be a chance for--
[00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:20.200]   a rare chance for guys to get a sense of what
[00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:23.320]   it's like to be a woman in modern America.
[00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:26.120]   But if I did it at one panel--
[00:08:26.120 --> 00:08:28.560]   the format of these panels are--
[00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:31.040]   they're like two or three speakers on the stage.
[00:08:31.040 --> 00:08:33.480]   Each of us talks for about 10 minutes,
[00:08:33.480 --> 00:08:35.640]   and then we open up the floor for questions and answers,
[00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:37.280]   and usually there's about 45 minutes to an hour
[00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:38.880]   for the questions.
[00:08:38.880 --> 00:08:40.880]   About 20 minutes before--
[00:08:40.880 --> 00:08:43.080]   20 minutes into the Q&A, there was a question.
[00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:45.000]   If no one has any more questions about the subject,
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:46.560]   Andy, can you tell me about your iPad?
[00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:48.480]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:49.640]   And then, of course, two minutes later,
[00:08:49.640 --> 00:08:51.560]   no one had any other questions except for the iPads.
[00:08:51.560 --> 00:08:54.000]   We're turning the panel up, my iPad.
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.520]   Oh, that's not going to happen much longer,
[00:08:56.520 --> 00:08:58.560]   but it's good to enjoy it while you're--
[00:08:58.560 --> 00:08:59.360]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:01.840]   It's good to walk in a room and have people
[00:09:01.840 --> 00:09:02.800]   be happy that you're there.
[00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:03.240]   That's all.
[00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:04.160]   We cherish that.
[00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:06.400]   Andy, of all the panelists, you're the one who's
[00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:07.360]   had it the longest.
[00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:09.800]   Are you jaded yet?
[00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:11.120]   Not at all.
[00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:14.360]   Just the opposite, because remember that for the first week
[00:09:14.360 --> 00:09:16.960]   that I had it, I couldn't use it outside.
[00:09:16.960 --> 00:09:18.760]   It had to stay inside the house,
[00:09:18.760 --> 00:09:20.560]   so that I wasn't allowed to use it in public.
[00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:22.240]   So that was the first time that I actually
[00:09:22.240 --> 00:09:25.440]   used it on a train, entertaining myself during a trip,
[00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:28.240]   the first time that I could be at a conference and say,
[00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:31.360]   yesterday morning when the news about--
[00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:34.000]   when I got the invitation to Apple's event on Thursday,
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:37.440]   you got an invitation, did you?
[00:09:37.440 --> 00:09:38.440]   Of course.
[00:09:38.440 --> 00:09:40.640]   I'll never be getting another invitation again,
[00:09:40.640 --> 00:09:42.120]   I can tell you right now.
[00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:44.240]   I know now.
[00:09:44.240 --> 00:09:45.720]   The silence is deafening.
[00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:52.480]   But that was a-- so it's exactly the use scenario
[00:09:52.480 --> 00:09:54.120]   that I always imagined that I just
[00:09:54.120 --> 00:09:57.480]   want to dash off a quick four or 500 words about a topic.
[00:09:57.480 --> 00:09:59.080]   Otherwise, I would have had to bring out
[00:09:59.080 --> 00:10:01.480]   my entire laptop with me and carry it with me all day.
[00:10:01.480 --> 00:10:03.240]   Here, I just took this out of my satchel,
[00:10:03.240 --> 00:10:05.240]   bounced it on my knees, wrote four or 500 words,
[00:10:05.240 --> 00:10:07.720]   just on the virtual keyboard, and published it all
[00:10:07.720 --> 00:10:10.200]   within the space of 20, 25 minutes.
[00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:14.880]   It is the most-- it really does fill in a gap that has existed
[00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:17.120]   for at least 10 years for me, and I couldn't be more excited
[00:10:17.120 --> 00:10:17.520]   about it.
[00:10:17.520 --> 00:10:18.640]   Unfortunately, we've lost John.
[00:10:18.640 --> 00:10:20.240]   I'm going to keep trying to get him back,
[00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:24.600]   because he was the one who I thought very saliently observed
[00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:28.560]   before the iPad came out that there must be some magic mojo
[00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:29.560]   that Apple's got.
[00:10:29.560 --> 00:10:31.440]   Otherwise, what's the difference between this
[00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:34.640]   and the other laptops that Bill Gates has been trying
[00:10:34.640 --> 00:10:40.080]   to voice upon the public for over a decade?
[00:10:40.080 --> 00:10:41.920]   No, it's a brand new thing.
[00:10:41.920 --> 00:10:44.040]   That's the point that you're trying to impress when people
[00:10:44.040 --> 00:10:45.200]   ask me about it.
[00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:47.120]   Don't think of it as an alternative to a net book.
[00:10:47.120 --> 00:10:49.200]   Don't think of it as a super duper book reader.
[00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:50.440]   It is a brand new thing.
[00:10:50.440 --> 00:10:53.320]   It's a cousin of a class of computer called the iPad.
[00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:56.600]   Later on in this year, there'll be other slate-like computers
[00:10:56.600 --> 00:10:57.840]   out there that we can compare it to.
[00:10:57.840 --> 00:10:59.440]   But for now, this is what we have.
[00:10:59.440 --> 00:11:02.520]   And it's up to all those other manufacturers, like Microsoft
[00:11:02.520 --> 00:11:04.480]   and Dell and all those other companies,
[00:11:04.480 --> 00:11:07.440]   to make a machine that is as good as the iPad.
[00:11:07.440 --> 00:11:09.640]   And I really don't think that they've got, but it takes to make it.
[00:11:09.640 --> 00:11:12.400]   It is perfectly-- almost perfectly executed.
[00:11:12.400 --> 00:11:13.680]   Sorry to keep losing you, John.
[00:11:13.680 --> 00:11:15.040]   I don't know if that's my fault.
[00:11:15.040 --> 00:11:16.160]   I could be here.
[00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:17.160]   What the hell?
[00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:19.040]   I'll just keep calling you back and calling you there.
[00:11:19.040 --> 00:11:20.120]   You don't get-- you know what I mean?
[00:11:20.120 --> 00:11:21.640]   You'd think in a hometown of Comcast,
[00:11:21.640 --> 00:11:23.680]   you'd get good internet.
[00:11:23.680 --> 00:11:25.800]   You mean not since the FCC ruling.
[00:11:25.800 --> 00:11:26.720]   You mean cable-- what is it?
[00:11:26.720 --> 00:11:28.000]   Cable town?
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:28.880]   Yeah, cable town.
[00:11:28.880 --> 00:11:30.680]   With a K. With a K.
[00:11:30.680 --> 00:11:33.120]   So John, I was saying while you were gone,
[00:11:33.120 --> 00:11:35.600]   that you, I thought, various Stuitley said
[00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:37.240]   that there's got to be something magic in this
[00:11:37.240 --> 00:11:39.720]   that makes it better than all the other tablets we've seen
[00:11:39.720 --> 00:11:40.960]   for the last decade.
[00:11:40.960 --> 00:11:43.440]   Now that you've played with it for a while, is there?
[00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:44.720]   I think there's a couple of things.
[00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:49.760]   I think it's-- I think the whole simplicity of the interface
[00:11:49.760 --> 00:11:52.360]   is absolutely--
[00:11:52.360 --> 00:11:54.000]   Oh, he's going to be gone again, I think.
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:55.000]   OK.
[00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:57.440]   We're going to lose you.
[00:11:57.440 --> 00:11:58.000]   Or no.
[00:11:58.000 --> 00:11:58.560]   Still here.
[00:11:58.560 --> 00:12:00.320]   Yeah, you just froze.
[00:12:00.320 --> 00:12:02.520]   Are you on Wi-Fi, John?
[00:12:02.520 --> 00:12:04.240]   By any chance, are you on a Wi-Fi connection
[00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:05.280]   or a wired connection?
[00:12:05.280 --> 00:12:08.400]   But I am, but there's nothing I can do about that.
[00:12:08.400 --> 00:12:10.080]   Yeah, this is a Wi-Fi problem.
[00:12:10.080 --> 00:12:13.200]   We get all the time, which is that Wi-Fi drops all the time.
[00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:16.000]   Nobody would normally notice it, but you do want a phone call.
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:16.480]   Because--
[00:12:16.480 --> 00:12:17.320]   What did you hear me say?
[00:12:17.320 --> 00:12:18.400]   Did I say something--
[00:12:18.400 --> 00:12:19.560]   You said nothing.
[00:12:19.560 --> 00:12:20.960]   I said nothing.
[00:12:20.960 --> 00:12:22.400]   Say nothing.
[00:12:22.400 --> 00:12:23.440]   This time, let's hear you.
[00:12:23.440 --> 00:12:24.200]   Say something.
[00:12:24.200 --> 00:12:27.040]   No, you said-- all we heard you say was,
[00:12:27.040 --> 00:12:29.360]   there's definitely something going on.
[00:12:29.360 --> 00:12:30.800]   And what is it?
[00:12:30.800 --> 00:12:33.960]   Well, I think the simplicity of the interface is one thing.
[00:12:33.960 --> 00:12:36.080]   And it's just joyful-- just the feel of it,
[00:12:36.080 --> 00:12:38.960]   that it just feels joyful to use.
[00:12:38.960 --> 00:12:40.280]   Wow.
[00:12:40.280 --> 00:12:42.760]   And the other thing, though, is got to be battery life.
[00:12:42.760 --> 00:12:45.760]   I mean, the battery life is absolutely insane.
[00:12:45.760 --> 00:12:47.480]   I mean, all the reviews are emphasizing
[00:12:47.480 --> 00:12:50.040]   that the battery life is surprisingly good,
[00:12:50.040 --> 00:12:52.080]   better than the 10 hours that Apple's promising.
[00:12:52.080 --> 00:12:53.640]   And for me, it really is.
[00:12:53.640 --> 00:12:55.760]   I mean, it just blows me away.
[00:12:55.760 --> 00:12:58.000]   I mean, and I have all sorts of tricks that I know that when
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:01.280]   I'm using my MacBook Pro on battery, not plugged in,
[00:13:01.280 --> 00:13:02.480]   I know to quit things.
[00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:05.360]   I know to not leave a lot of background tabs running
[00:13:05.360 --> 00:13:08.200]   in Safari, because the more stuff running in Safari,
[00:13:08.200 --> 00:13:11.240]   there's just little tiny bits of JavaScript running add up
[00:13:11.240 --> 00:13:12.560]   to a lot of CPU cycles.
[00:13:12.560 --> 00:13:14.920]   And all of a sudden, you've only got 90 minutes a bit.
[00:13:14.920 --> 00:13:18.320]   With this thing, I mean, if you don't plug it in,
[00:13:18.320 --> 00:13:19.000]   it's still there.
[00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:22.200]   And it still looks-- it's never dropped below 50% for me.
[00:13:22.200 --> 00:13:23.120]   Right.
[00:13:23.120 --> 00:13:25.720]   That is the two things that we didn't know ahead of time.
[00:13:25.720 --> 00:13:27.240]   I'll give you a second, in a second, Chris.
[00:13:27.240 --> 00:13:29.000]   But that's the two things we really couldn't be sure
[00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:29.880]   of ahead of time.
[00:13:29.880 --> 00:13:32.840]   Apple claimed 10 hours, not only is it 10 hours in some tests
[00:13:32.840 --> 00:13:35.200]   and it's more than 10 hours.
[00:13:35.200 --> 00:13:38.320]   And the snappiness and responsiveness of it,
[00:13:38.320 --> 00:13:41.240]   and just the way the screen feels,
[00:13:41.240 --> 00:13:43.640]   those of us who held it at the event,
[00:13:43.640 --> 00:13:44.920]   we're telling people who hadn't held it.
[00:13:44.920 --> 00:13:46.400]   No, wait, wait, wait, because there's more to it
[00:13:46.400 --> 00:13:47.680]   than meets the eye.
[00:13:47.680 --> 00:13:50.440]   And I think that that's even more to the case.
[00:13:50.440 --> 00:13:50.880]   Go ahead, Chris.
[00:13:50.880 --> 00:13:52.680]   I'll add one more thing just before you pass it off.
[00:13:52.680 --> 00:13:53.200]   Yeah, sure, just.
[00:13:53.200 --> 00:13:56.600]   One more thing is that the viewing angle on the IPS
[00:13:56.600 --> 00:13:59.320]   is really to be amazing.
[00:13:59.320 --> 00:13:59.840]   It's just amazing.
[00:13:59.840 --> 00:14:02.680]   And that was to me the big question I had all along
[00:14:02.680 --> 00:14:05.840]   for two years with these rampant rumors of hey,
[00:14:05.840 --> 00:14:08.080]   Apple's going to make a tablet is,
[00:14:08.080 --> 00:14:09.720]   it seems to me you're going to want to--
[00:14:09.720 --> 00:14:11.320]   like when you're having coffee in the morning,
[00:14:11.320 --> 00:14:13.720]   you want to set it down flat on the table
[00:14:13.720 --> 00:14:15.840]   and you have a cup of coffee or a bowl of cereal or whatever.
[00:14:15.840 --> 00:14:17.520]   And that's how you read magazines.
[00:14:17.520 --> 00:14:18.800]   It's flat on the table.
[00:14:18.800 --> 00:14:22.640]   That's an angle that never worked for LCD screens.
[00:14:22.640 --> 00:14:23.720]   It works great with this.
[00:14:23.720 --> 00:14:24.440]   It really does.
[00:14:24.440 --> 00:14:26.520]   And I put my iPhone down as a comparison.
[00:14:26.520 --> 00:14:28.760]   And you really-- you kind of have
[00:14:28.760 --> 00:14:31.360]   to prop your iPhone up at a closer
[00:14:31.360 --> 00:14:34.560]   to a perpendicular angle to your eyes.
[00:14:34.560 --> 00:14:38.160]   And the iPad viewing angle is really, really
[00:14:38.160 --> 00:14:39.720]   phenomenal for reading.
[00:14:39.720 --> 00:14:42.720]   Chris Breen, what have you noticed that you didn't expect?
[00:14:42.720 --> 00:14:44.280]   Well, I was going to jump in on battery life,
[00:14:44.280 --> 00:14:46.160]   because this indicates that Apple is
[00:14:46.160 --> 00:14:48.520]   confident about battery life.
[00:14:48.520 --> 00:14:50.360]   And this is a game they routinely play.
[00:14:50.360 --> 00:14:52.280]   When the iPods first came out, they said, yes,
[00:14:52.280 --> 00:14:56.080]   they'll get 10 hours or so.
[00:14:56.080 --> 00:14:58.840]   But there was a lot of finagling you'd have to do
[00:14:58.840 --> 00:15:00.400]   in order to get that kind of life out of it.
[00:15:00.400 --> 00:15:02.280]   And the iPhone in the same kind of way.
[00:15:02.280 --> 00:15:04.720]   With the iPad, what they've done is what they eventually
[00:15:04.720 --> 00:15:07.600]   did with the iPods is they said, yeah, you'll get 15 hours.
[00:15:07.600 --> 00:15:08.280]   You get 30 hours.
[00:15:08.280 --> 00:15:09.800]   They're totally confident about that.
[00:15:09.800 --> 00:15:11.960]   And then when people actually put them to the test,
[00:15:11.960 --> 00:15:14.280]   they find out that they run much longer than that.
[00:15:14.280 --> 00:15:17.680]   And so it's interesting that a V1 product comes out
[00:15:17.680 --> 00:15:19.120]   with that confidence.
[00:15:19.120 --> 00:15:20.680]   Just before we started the show, you
[00:15:20.680 --> 00:15:21.840]   said, everybody get their iPads.
[00:15:21.840 --> 00:15:24.480]   I'm running this audio test, which I normally do with iPods
[00:15:24.480 --> 00:15:28.000]   and iPhones, to see how long you can play audio uninterrupted.
[00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:30.680]   It's been going for 48 hours.
[00:15:30.680 --> 00:15:35.080]   I have to leave town in two days, and it's at 70%.
[00:15:35.080 --> 00:15:35.440]   Wow.
[00:15:35.440 --> 00:15:38.720]   So I just abandoned the test, because I'll never
[00:15:38.720 --> 00:15:41.240]   have my iPad back again.
[00:15:41.240 --> 00:15:44.680]   And apparently, Mossberg talked to Steve Jobs about this.
[00:15:44.680 --> 00:15:46.680]   And Jobs said, oh, yeah, you get audio playback
[00:15:46.680 --> 00:15:51.240]   uninterrupted for 140 hours, which is crazy.
[00:15:51.240 --> 00:15:53.600]   I could drive back and forth across the United States
[00:15:53.600 --> 00:15:57.080]   and listen to the same collection of music
[00:15:57.080 --> 00:15:59.440]   hour after hour after hour, and the thing would stay alive.
[00:15:59.440 --> 00:16:02.120]   So they've done very nicely on that.
[00:16:02.120 --> 00:16:04.280]   And again, I'm impressed that it's on a V1 product
[00:16:04.280 --> 00:16:06.040]   that the battery life is as good as it is.
[00:16:06.040 --> 00:16:08.360]   I think they've learned a lot from power management
[00:16:08.360 --> 00:16:10.480]   on the iPhone, where it's crucial.
[00:16:10.480 --> 00:16:12.120]   And the fact is, there's no 3G on here,
[00:16:12.120 --> 00:16:14.120]   so you don't have that kind of drain going on.
[00:16:14.120 --> 00:16:15.040]   Let's see what happens when you think.
[00:16:15.040 --> 00:16:17.040]   How the changes, when you're on 3G.
[00:16:17.040 --> 00:16:18.480]   And I definitely think it will change.
[00:16:18.480 --> 00:16:19.560]   I mean, I think they're one of the things
[00:16:19.560 --> 00:16:21.720]   that I do pretty often.
[00:16:21.720 --> 00:16:24.320]   Although I think the Wi-Fi is also another draw, you know,
[00:16:24.320 --> 00:16:26.520]   typically, I haven't seen it with this.
[00:16:26.520 --> 00:16:30.760]   But I know that with my iPhone, if I'm not using,
[00:16:30.760 --> 00:16:33.600]   if I wanted to extend its life, I'll actually turn it to Edge,
[00:16:33.600 --> 00:16:36.240]   which sometimes is more stable than 3G in San Francisco,
[00:16:36.240 --> 00:16:39.560]   and turn off the Wi-Fi and it'll last for days.
[00:16:39.560 --> 00:16:42.320]   You know, on my iPhone, it's amazing
[00:16:42.320 --> 00:16:44.920]   how much those two factors really chew into it.
[00:16:44.920 --> 00:16:46.960]   But I have to say that, yeah, I can't believe
[00:16:46.960 --> 00:16:48.600]   how long the battery lasts on these things.
[00:16:48.600 --> 00:16:50.360]   And the other thing is, is that, you know,
[00:16:50.360 --> 00:16:52.680]   I expected to be the same, I guess I expected
[00:16:52.680 --> 00:16:55.920]   to be the same performance as the iPhone
[00:16:55.920 --> 00:17:00.600]   and the fluidity of the motions and everything else.
[00:17:00.600 --> 00:17:03.360]   You really just feel like it's a much more futuristic device.
[00:17:03.360 --> 00:17:04.200]   - The speed is great.
[00:17:04.200 --> 00:17:06.720]   Yeah, if that's what Abby said when she got back
[00:17:06.720 --> 00:17:09.080]   on Sunday night, she hadn't held it yet,
[00:17:09.080 --> 00:17:11.560]   and she held it, she said, "I feel like I'm holding the future."
[00:17:11.560 --> 00:17:14.360]   It does kind of feel like that kind of a futuristic thing,
[00:17:14.360 --> 00:17:15.680]   doesn't it?
[00:17:15.680 --> 00:17:16.520]   Sorry to come up here.
[00:17:16.520 --> 00:17:20.440]   It really is the first new computer in 25 years.
[00:17:20.440 --> 00:17:21.280]   - That's funny.
[00:17:21.280 --> 00:17:23.040]   - I'm confident about saying that.
[00:17:23.040 --> 00:17:24.160]   - And it really is a family.
[00:17:24.160 --> 00:17:28.680]   You know, my kids and I, I brought one back.
[00:17:28.680 --> 00:17:31.280]   I gave my son got one for his birthday, his birthday was--
[00:17:31.280 --> 00:17:32.280]   - That's a kid to my own.
[00:17:32.280 --> 00:17:34.280]   (laughing)
[00:17:34.280 --> 00:17:36.080]   - It was three, it was days afterward.
[00:17:36.080 --> 00:17:38.280]   - No, no, you had to give it to him, you had no chance.
[00:17:38.280 --> 00:17:39.200]   - And he really wanted one.
[00:17:39.200 --> 00:17:40.120]   And I knew that he'd use it a lot,
[00:17:40.120 --> 00:17:41.600]   and of course now he just completely ignores me.
[00:17:41.600 --> 00:17:45.040]   And he's sitting there just enveloped
[00:17:45.040 --> 00:17:46.200]   in this little iPad world.
[00:17:46.200 --> 00:17:47.680]   But one of the things that, when I pull him out of it,
[00:17:47.680 --> 00:17:49.080]   one of the things we were doing is playing this,
[00:17:49.080 --> 00:17:51.680]   that Scrabble that you hook up with the Bluetooth
[00:17:51.680 --> 00:17:52.800]   or the Wi-Fi.
[00:17:52.800 --> 00:17:55.040]   And so my kids have iPhones,
[00:17:55.040 --> 00:17:57.720]   so that it was either your iPhone or his iPad.
[00:17:57.720 --> 00:18:00.680]   And my iPad was like the hub.
[00:18:00.680 --> 00:18:04.240]   And it was just, I don't think of doing that on my laptop.
[00:18:04.240 --> 00:18:05.880]   I don't know why, but I just don't have that experience
[00:18:05.880 --> 00:18:07.360]   where the three of us are sitting,
[00:18:07.360 --> 00:18:08.920]   we're sitting around playing Scrabble together
[00:18:08.920 --> 00:18:11.720]   where everyone's flicking, and it works remarkably well.
[00:18:11.720 --> 00:18:13.600]   Actually, I like it better than actually working
[00:18:13.600 --> 00:18:15.560]   with the physical version of Scrabble.
[00:18:15.560 --> 00:18:19.960]   And I just, that's something that,
[00:18:19.960 --> 00:18:21.880]   there's a whole bunch of things, that's one area,
[00:18:21.880 --> 00:18:23.240]   but there's a whole bunch of things that I realized
[00:18:23.240 --> 00:18:25.080]   that there's a lot of applications that I took off.
[00:18:25.080 --> 00:18:27.320]   You know, it automatically sunk the 300 applications
[00:18:27.320 --> 00:18:29.360]   I have from my iPhone onto my iPad.
[00:18:29.360 --> 00:18:31.120]   And I still was pretty awful, wasn't it?
[00:18:31.120 --> 00:18:33.040]   Did the same thing to me, two hours later, I'm going,
[00:18:33.040 --> 00:18:34.960]   oh God, oh, you did.
[00:18:34.960 --> 00:18:36.440]   - It took me an hour and a half to think,
[00:18:36.440 --> 00:18:37.560]   I finally just stopped it,
[00:18:37.560 --> 00:18:38.880]   'cause Justine was over at her office
[00:18:38.880 --> 00:18:40.040]   and she was already playing with her,
[00:18:40.040 --> 00:18:42.080]   and I couldn't, I was like, okay, forget it.
[00:18:42.080 --> 00:18:45.520]   - And when you get an iPhone app on the thing,
[00:18:45.520 --> 00:18:47.760]   you really see the difference in screen size.
[00:18:47.760 --> 00:18:50.880]   I mean, it's just, it's a quarter of the size.
[00:18:50.880 --> 00:18:53.600]   And even if you double it up on the two dimensions,
[00:18:53.600 --> 00:18:55.400]   it just doesn't really that usable.
[00:18:55.400 --> 00:18:57.400]   I took almost all of the--
[00:18:57.400 --> 00:18:58.600]   - Yeah, I took almost all of it.
[00:18:58.600 --> 00:18:59.760]   - But there's a reason not to,
[00:18:59.760 --> 00:19:01.400]   because I noticed a number of people
[00:19:01.400 --> 00:19:04.280]   have been slipstreaming universal apps in.
[00:19:04.280 --> 00:19:07.040]   Zillow came out with a universal app,
[00:19:07.040 --> 00:19:10.000]   Zagit Guides came out with a universal app.
[00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:12.640]   And when they do, it's like, it's a wonderful little revelation,
[00:19:12.640 --> 00:19:13.720]   'cause you open it up and you go,
[00:19:13.720 --> 00:19:16.840]   "Oh, it's full screen, I just love it."
[00:19:16.840 --> 00:19:18.400]   It's using the other real estate
[00:19:18.400 --> 00:19:20.400]   and it's doing really good things.
[00:19:20.400 --> 00:19:22.000]   The Zagit Guide is a really good example
[00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:24.080]   of how this real estate makes a huge difference
[00:19:24.080 --> 00:19:26.160]   in what you could do on a UI.
[00:19:26.160 --> 00:19:29.160]   - Yeah, that's the big argument for when people were saying,
[00:19:29.160 --> 00:19:31.320]   this is just a big iPod touch.
[00:19:31.320 --> 00:19:33.040]   That totally changes when you see
[00:19:33.040 --> 00:19:37.040]   that that inner user interface on this big, huge full screen.
[00:19:37.040 --> 00:19:39.240]   As after the first day with the iPad,
[00:19:39.240 --> 00:19:41.240]   I stopped thinking of it as a big iPod touch
[00:19:41.240 --> 00:19:43.040]   and started thinking of my iPhone.
[00:19:43.040 --> 00:19:45.800]   As the mobile edition of the iPad operating system.
[00:19:45.800 --> 00:19:46.920]   - Well, it's not a bad thing though,
[00:19:46.920 --> 00:19:48.200]   to say it is a big iPod touch,
[00:19:48.200 --> 00:19:49.160]   'cause it really is.
[00:19:49.160 --> 00:19:50.520]   It's just that that bigger screen,
[00:19:50.520 --> 00:19:54.960]   that faster processor makes a big iPod touch really cool.
[00:19:54.960 --> 00:19:56.320]   It's a good thing to have.
[00:19:56.320 --> 00:19:57.160]   - Well, it's true.
[00:19:57.160 --> 00:19:58.560]   And I think as John said,
[00:19:58.560 --> 00:20:02.360]   that I think a couple of hours after owning his iPad,
[00:20:02.360 --> 00:20:05.040]   he tweeted, "Wow, my iPhone really sucks."
[00:20:05.040 --> 00:20:06.400]   - Yeah, you don't wanna go back.
[00:20:06.400 --> 00:20:08.200]   I have this connected. - And it does.
[00:20:08.200 --> 00:20:10.880]   Yeah, and that really seems so cheap.
[00:20:10.880 --> 00:20:13.720]   Because that, I mean, for things like control surfaces,
[00:20:13.720 --> 00:20:16.400]   or because I'm a musician, I think about music apps,
[00:20:16.400 --> 00:20:18.640]   and things where I can interact with my computer,
[00:20:18.640 --> 00:20:21.200]   or instruments, this is a really big deal.
[00:20:21.200 --> 00:20:22.800]   They have things like that on the iPhone,
[00:20:22.800 --> 00:20:25.280]   but you're working in these little tiny spaces,
[00:20:25.280 --> 00:20:27.480]   and it's uncomfortable to work with that.
[00:20:27.480 --> 00:20:29.400]   And it was a miracle when you could do it on your iPhone,
[00:20:29.400 --> 00:20:31.720]   but now the fact that you have the kind of real estate
[00:20:31.720 --> 00:20:33.080]   where you can do something useful with it,
[00:20:33.080 --> 00:20:36.160]   and do it for long periods of time, is incredible.
[00:20:36.160 --> 00:20:38.760]   So I completely disagree with this.
[00:20:38.760 --> 00:20:39.800]   Oh, it's a big iPod touch,
[00:20:39.800 --> 00:20:41.160]   as if that's a bad thing.
[00:20:41.160 --> 00:20:42.160]   - No, it's a good thing.
[00:20:42.160 --> 00:20:44.920]   - The better way, I think, to show somebody who wants to,
[00:20:44.920 --> 00:20:46.160]   if somebody still wants to argue
[00:20:46.160 --> 00:20:47.520]   that it's just a big iPod touch,
[00:20:47.520 --> 00:20:48.880]   the better way than to show them,
[00:20:48.880 --> 00:20:51.320]   and a native iPad app,
[00:20:51.320 --> 00:20:55.480]   is to show them an iPhone app scaled up to 2X.
[00:20:55.480 --> 00:20:57.320]   - That's a big iPod touch.
[00:20:57.320 --> 00:21:02.160]   - Right, and even if you ignore the pixel doubling,
[00:21:02.160 --> 00:21:03.760]   which, you know, it's looks, if you just, you know,
[00:21:03.760 --> 00:21:05.960]   I just say, just imagine that it looked good,
[00:21:05.960 --> 00:21:08.400]   you can just, just using it, it's just not good.
[00:21:08.400 --> 00:21:11.440]   It's just, you know, these are your iPhone apps
[00:21:11.440 --> 00:21:14.040]   are user interfaces that are designed to be used
[00:21:14.040 --> 00:21:18.840]   with one thumb going diagonal to diagonal on a three inch screen.
[00:21:18.840 --> 00:21:22.040]   Whereas this is something that's meant to be used with two hands.
[00:21:22.040 --> 00:21:24.280]   I mean, it's, you know, totally different.
[00:21:24.280 --> 00:21:28.360]   - Even this swollen keyboard on the old interface
[00:21:28.360 --> 00:21:31.120]   is not anywhere near as good as the keyboard
[00:21:31.120 --> 00:21:33.760]   that comes on the iPad.
[00:21:33.760 --> 00:21:36.840]   - Well, and analysis, I downloaded, of course,
[00:21:36.840 --> 00:21:38.960]   a bunch of the magazines, you know, whether it's time,
[00:21:38.960 --> 00:21:40.640]   you know, Time Magazine and Popular Science,
[00:21:40.640 --> 00:21:42.000]   and a couple of books.
[00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:44.920]   And the one that for me just, as soon as I,
[00:21:44.920 --> 00:21:46.960]   someone suggested, someone tweeted me
[00:21:46.960 --> 00:21:48.520]   that I should download Elements.
[00:21:48.520 --> 00:21:49.680]   Did you guys download the--
[00:21:49.680 --> 00:21:52.000]   - I saw Andy showed it to me last week.
[00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:53.360]   - Yeah. - I was just beautiful,
[00:21:53.360 --> 00:21:54.200]   but it's expensive. - It was like one of those things,
[00:21:54.200 --> 00:21:56.920]   like I downloaded, I forgot that the book even existed,
[00:21:56.920 --> 00:21:57.760]   you know, it was one of those things.
[00:21:57.760 --> 00:21:59.640]   Like, I think I have it in my library and I just forgot.
[00:21:59.640 --> 00:22:03.800]   And the thing is, is that it, it was a gorgeous book.
[00:22:03.800 --> 00:22:05.040]   And so it's the periodic table,
[00:22:05.040 --> 00:22:06.360]   but it's these great photos--
[00:22:06.360 --> 00:22:08.840]   - A shirt-cutch. - It sure comes alive
[00:22:08.840 --> 00:22:11.120]   when you do it in this thing.
[00:22:11.120 --> 00:22:13.360]   I mean, you spin them rocks. - Well, it does be elemental
[00:22:13.360 --> 00:22:14.200]   roasting. - Yeah.
[00:22:14.200 --> 00:22:15.720]   And you know what, it's like a,
[00:22:15.720 --> 00:22:19.560]   it's there's a trick going on because you can spin all of them.
[00:22:19.560 --> 00:22:24.560]   And they all stay spinning and then they slowly degrade.
[00:22:24.560 --> 00:22:26.760]   I mean, it's like plate spinning.
[00:22:26.760 --> 00:22:28.360]   It's, this is a remarkable app.
[00:22:28.360 --> 00:22:31.920]   However, it's like 15, 14 bucks for this, right?
[00:22:31.920 --> 00:22:33.880]   - I know, but when I saw that I was like,
[00:22:33.880 --> 00:22:35.000]   textbooks are dead. - It's pretty cool.
[00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:36.640]   - But it totally doesn't that thing.
[00:22:36.640 --> 00:22:40.120]   I swear to God, Wesley Crusher had that thing on Star Trek,
[00:22:40.120 --> 00:22:40.920]   the next generation.
[00:22:40.920 --> 00:22:43.040]   I swear to God, there's a couple of episodes
[00:22:43.040 --> 00:22:45.040]   where he's got that thing and that's how he's learning
[00:22:45.040 --> 00:22:46.320]   chemistry or learn what he's doing.
[00:22:46.320 --> 00:22:48.120]   - We gotta get Wil Wheaton on the show and ask him.
[00:22:48.120 --> 00:22:50.160]   'Cause-- - And I saw, I mean, I was,
[00:22:50.160 --> 00:22:53.680]   I showed that to a friend of mine who's actually a chemistry,
[00:22:53.680 --> 00:22:54.520]   chemistry teacher.
[00:22:54.520 --> 00:22:55.520]   She's like, oh my gosh, I have to get an iPad
[00:22:55.520 --> 00:22:57.560]   just to get that application.
[00:22:57.560 --> 00:22:58.480]   - Yeah, I showed my high school.
[00:22:58.480 --> 00:22:59.400]   - It was just like, you know, I have to,
[00:22:59.400 --> 00:23:00.960]   that's something I got to use in my class.
[00:23:00.960 --> 00:23:02.320]   - I showed my high school senior daughter,
[00:23:02.320 --> 00:23:03.160]   same reaction.
[00:23:03.160 --> 00:23:05.560]   I was like, oh man, I wish we'd had this.
[00:23:05.560 --> 00:23:06.840]   - It's really interesting 'cause you know,
[00:23:06.840 --> 00:23:09.160]   I have a high school freshman and a high school senior.
[00:23:09.160 --> 00:23:12.120]   And already there's a three years difference.
[00:23:12.120 --> 00:23:15.000]   There's a gulf between what, oh, I wish we had this
[00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:16.200]   when I was a kid.
[00:23:16.200 --> 00:23:17.040]   (laughing)
[00:23:17.040 --> 00:23:20.920]   I mean, it's kind of, it's, this things are moving
[00:23:20.920 --> 00:23:22.160]   a little too fast.
[00:23:22.160 --> 00:23:25.720]   - I, my son is six and he's in kindergarten.
[00:23:25.720 --> 00:23:29.000]   And I really had a hard time getting any time with it.
[00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:32.960]   I came on Saturday by UPS and I really had
[00:23:32.960 --> 00:23:34.320]   a hard time getting any time with it.
[00:23:34.320 --> 00:23:37.080]   I mean, he took to it like nothing else.
[00:23:37.080 --> 00:23:39.440]   I mean, he's used a Mac and played some games
[00:23:39.440 --> 00:23:40.280]   and stuff like that.
[00:23:40.280 --> 00:23:44.520]   But for a kid like, I mean, he really has,
[00:23:44.520 --> 00:23:46.040]   you can see it with him with a mouse,
[00:23:46.040 --> 00:23:48.160]   that there's a motor coordination thing
[00:23:48.160 --> 00:23:51.360]   and a disconnect that this, he took to this like nothing.
[00:23:51.360 --> 00:23:52.200]   - This is natural.
[00:23:52.200 --> 00:23:53.040]   - I've ever seen before.
[00:23:53.040 --> 00:23:54.360]   And the other thing that I thought was really interesting
[00:23:54.360 --> 00:23:57.040]   is I showed him iBooks and the first app,
[00:23:57.040 --> 00:23:59.680]   you know, you get the--
[00:23:59.680 --> 00:24:00.520]   - Winnie the Pooh.
[00:24:00.520 --> 00:24:01.680]   - Winnie the Pooh.
[00:24:01.680 --> 00:24:02.960]   So I just gave it to him.
[00:24:02.960 --> 00:24:05.480]   I just said here, launched this and gave it to him
[00:24:05.480 --> 00:24:06.480]   to see what he would do.
[00:24:06.480 --> 00:24:08.240]   And he just took to it immediately
[00:24:08.240 --> 00:24:10.560]   and started swiping pages in the book.
[00:24:10.560 --> 00:24:11.400]   - Got it.
[00:24:11.400 --> 00:24:12.240]   - Yeah.
[00:24:12.240 --> 00:24:16.040]   - Yeah, I mean, he didn't ask and took to swiping
[00:24:16.040 --> 00:24:18.320]   rather than tapping without even thinking about it.
[00:24:18.320 --> 00:24:19.360]   - Well, and the Dr. Seuss,
[00:24:19.360 --> 00:24:21.240]   I don't know if you've gotten any of the Dr. Seuss books,
[00:24:21.240 --> 00:24:22.080]   but the--
[00:24:22.080 --> 00:24:22.960]   - Now they're standalone apps, right?
[00:24:22.960 --> 00:24:23.800]   Or are they in the books?
[00:24:23.800 --> 00:24:24.640]   - They're standalone apps.
[00:24:24.640 --> 00:24:26.640]   And I talked to, I actually was talking to someone
[00:24:26.640 --> 00:24:27.960]   who does a lot of publishing.
[00:24:27.960 --> 00:24:30.840]   And they said, you know, the iBooks are gonna be great,
[00:24:30.840 --> 00:24:33.080]   but they said a lot of publishers,
[00:24:33.080 --> 00:24:35.800]   just to get, especially if they're very picture-based,
[00:24:35.800 --> 00:24:37.240]   are really gonna be building their own apps
[00:24:37.240 --> 00:24:39.880]   because the book format doesn't really let them do
[00:24:39.880 --> 00:24:41.640]   what they wanna do to take full advantage of it.
[00:24:41.640 --> 00:24:44.480]   And so, but it was so well implemented.
[00:24:44.480 --> 00:24:46.560]   I downloaded a couple of the Dr. Seuss books,
[00:24:46.560 --> 00:24:47.560]   'cause I love them, you know,
[00:24:47.560 --> 00:24:48.920]   and I figured my son will love them.
[00:24:48.920 --> 00:24:52.040]   And not only do they swipe, but they'll read it to you.
[00:24:52.040 --> 00:24:54.320]   And then they have little pan and zooms
[00:24:54.320 --> 00:24:55.560]   into different parts of the picture.
[00:24:55.560 --> 00:24:57.520]   So it'll move you from one place to the other.
[00:24:57.520 --> 00:24:59.480]   And they've already started breaking up
[00:24:59.480 --> 00:25:01.680]   that we're just gonna have pages that you turn
[00:25:01.680 --> 00:25:03.680]   into a much more interactive experience.
[00:25:03.680 --> 00:25:07.240]   And it's just, you know, I'm not buying it.
[00:25:07.240 --> 00:25:09.080]   I mean, it's gonna be a year from now,
[00:25:09.080 --> 00:25:11.440]   I think will be the next year will be the last,
[00:25:11.440 --> 00:25:14.480]   my last year of buying anything on paper.
[00:25:14.480 --> 00:25:18.520]   - Now, now, Daniel Bryan in his blog,
[00:25:18.520 --> 00:25:22.720]   Oblamofka said, and Corey Doctor of quoted him,
[00:25:22.720 --> 00:25:25.640]   that really, this was just the return of the CD-ROM.
[00:25:25.640 --> 00:25:28.800]   And that, and I think Jeff Jarvis picked this up as well,
[00:25:28.800 --> 00:25:31.480]   that the publishers were loving it because it was a lock-in.
[00:25:31.480 --> 00:25:33.280]   And, you know, when I hear Dr. Seuss apps,
[00:25:33.280 --> 00:25:34.640]   as opposed to a Dr. Seuss book,
[00:25:34.640 --> 00:25:38.680]   I kind of cringed a little bit, that it's a lock-in.
[00:25:38.680 --> 00:25:43.480]   And Danny's point is it's gonna be just as ho-hum
[00:25:43.480 --> 00:25:44.480]   in a couple of years, we're gonna go,
[00:25:44.480 --> 00:25:45.960]   "What were we all so excited about?"
[00:25:45.960 --> 00:25:48.880]   Why isn't this just the return of the CD-ROM?
[00:25:48.880 --> 00:25:51.840]   - Well, it might be, it might be the return of the CD-ROM,
[00:25:51.840 --> 00:25:53.440]   but the thing is, if it's a lock-in, you know,
[00:25:53.440 --> 00:25:54.440]   I'll hand you the key.
[00:25:54.440 --> 00:25:55.760]   I mean, you know, the thing is, is that this is key--
[00:25:55.760 --> 00:25:57.400]   - I guess we're all kind of going for it, aren't we?
[00:25:57.400 --> 00:25:59.840]   - Well, and the thing is, is that I think that Apple
[00:25:59.840 --> 00:26:01.960]   has enough of a trajectory that we, you know,
[00:26:01.960 --> 00:26:03.640]   it's not like it's gonna be a flash in the pan.
[00:26:03.640 --> 00:26:06.280]   This isn't somebody's little idea of an iPad
[00:26:06.280 --> 00:26:07.800]   or some kind of tablet device.
[00:26:07.800 --> 00:26:09.320]   We know that this is gonna go somewhere.
[00:26:09.320 --> 00:26:10.640]   We know that it's gonna be successful.
[00:26:10.640 --> 00:26:12.200]   We know what the iPhone is gonna look like,
[00:26:12.200 --> 00:26:14.280]   you know, made it, you know, where it went.
[00:26:14.280 --> 00:26:16.480]   And so it's not like we're, you know,
[00:26:16.480 --> 00:26:18.560]   I'm not worried about going down a dead end.
[00:26:18.560 --> 00:26:20.680]   That's how you sell 300,000 units in the first day,
[00:26:20.680 --> 00:26:22.880]   is that people aren't worried about a dead end,
[00:26:22.880 --> 00:26:25.000]   you know, relationship with this.
[00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:26.200]   But in addition to that, you know,
[00:26:26.200 --> 00:26:27.760]   I do think that there were a lot of things
[00:26:27.760 --> 00:26:29.080]   that were available with CD-ROMs,
[00:26:29.080 --> 00:26:30.800]   but nothing had this kind of performance.
[00:26:30.800 --> 00:26:32.040]   And you had to keep on switching them all
[00:26:32.040 --> 00:26:32.880]   and everything else.
[00:26:32.880 --> 00:26:34.840]   The idea is that you can have all the books that you want,
[00:26:34.840 --> 00:26:35.840]   you know, on one--
[00:26:35.840 --> 00:26:37.440]   - I think that's a great point.
[00:26:37.440 --> 00:26:38.280]   - I think that's a great point.
[00:26:38.280 --> 00:26:39.520]   I was just thinking about that was that
[00:26:39.520 --> 00:26:41.840]   we think about the switching them in and out thing,
[00:26:41.840 --> 00:26:43.760]   and there's only one at a time, and you hit each act,
[00:26:43.760 --> 00:26:46.520]   and you wait, and you have to amount, and find the disk,
[00:26:46.520 --> 00:26:47.760]   take it out of the case, put it in,
[00:26:47.760 --> 00:26:49.040]   make sure it doesn't get scratched.
[00:26:49.040 --> 00:26:50.720]   So the analogy is right there,
[00:26:50.720 --> 00:26:52.480]   if you wanna go with the CD-ROM analogy,
[00:26:52.480 --> 00:26:54.240]   it's right there with CDs for music
[00:26:54.240 --> 00:26:58.480]   versus digital music and CD-ROMs and this,
[00:26:58.480 --> 00:27:01.320]   where you can just have all of them right there,
[00:27:01.320 --> 00:27:04.840]   one type of the home screen and a tap on the icon away.
[00:27:04.840 --> 00:27:05.920]   I mean, it's a huge difference.
[00:27:05.920 --> 00:27:07.960]   - There's where a lack of multitasking makes a difference.
[00:27:07.960 --> 00:27:09.080]   Go ahead, Andy.
[00:27:09.080 --> 00:27:13.360]   - No, I was just gonna say, I mean,
[00:27:13.360 --> 00:27:15.560]   I think the real goal is for this to become a home home
[00:27:15.560 --> 00:27:16.520]   in two years.
[00:27:16.520 --> 00:27:18.320]   I mean, once it's the last time someone said,
[00:27:18.320 --> 00:27:21.120]   you've realized that I typed this message,
[00:27:21.120 --> 00:27:22.720]   and if I typed a press book,
[00:27:22.720 --> 00:27:24.000]   I didn't have to print it or anything,
[00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:26.400]   but the person was able to receive it and read it,
[00:27:26.400 --> 00:27:29.080]   not one minute later, we are in the world of tomorrow.
[00:27:29.080 --> 00:27:32.160]   It's like, well, get over yourself, it's email with hell.
[00:27:32.160 --> 00:27:34.480]   Do you just follow up on Turniftruck?
[00:27:34.480 --> 00:27:36.840]   The iPad is just gonna be the invisible medium
[00:27:36.840 --> 00:27:40.080]   that propels all of our content and all of our communication.
[00:27:40.080 --> 00:27:41.280]   - Well, also the key difference is
[00:27:41.280 --> 00:27:43.320]   that this is a portable device,
[00:27:43.320 --> 00:27:45.960]   and you had CD-ROMs, and so you have to read
[00:27:45.960 --> 00:27:48.200]   or experience your media by sitting in a computer,
[00:27:48.200 --> 00:27:49.640]   which most people don't wanna do,
[00:27:49.640 --> 00:27:51.480]   or at least not for long periods of time.
[00:27:51.480 --> 00:27:53.600]   I can take this on a plane, I can take it on the train,
[00:27:53.600 --> 00:27:55.960]   I can walk outside with it, I can go anywhere I like,
[00:27:55.960 --> 00:27:59.000]   and then now I have a book,
[00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:00.880]   except it happens to be electronic,
[00:28:00.880 --> 00:28:02.600]   and so yeah, maybe it does become home,
[00:28:02.600 --> 00:28:05.680]   but also that first rash of CD-ROMs came out,
[00:28:05.680 --> 00:28:07.920]   they were garish, there was way too much going on
[00:28:07.920 --> 00:28:09.120]   and the things, and it really wasn't
[00:28:09.120 --> 00:28:10.760]   a terrific learning experience.
[00:28:10.760 --> 00:28:12.800]   We have plenty of time to refine this now.
[00:28:12.800 --> 00:28:14.880]   I've been talking to a lot of book authors about this,
[00:28:14.880 --> 00:28:16.480]   and everybody's saying, well,
[00:28:16.480 --> 00:28:18.320]   we don't wanna repeat the CD-ROM experience,
[00:28:18.320 --> 00:28:19.680]   and we probably will for a while.
[00:28:19.680 --> 00:28:22.360]   There's gonna be some horrible stuff for a while,
[00:28:22.360 --> 00:28:24.600]   but eventually we're gonna come up with ways
[00:28:24.600 --> 00:28:27.200]   to do this properly just as they've done with applications,
[00:28:27.200 --> 00:28:31.400]   and it will be a very rich, very intriguing experience.
[00:28:31.400 --> 00:28:32.640]   >> I do have to say though--
[00:28:32.640 --> 00:28:34.320]   >> Also, they can just add this to their workflow.
[00:28:34.320 --> 00:28:37.560]   It's just, they print a PDF, they print a digital,
[00:28:37.560 --> 00:28:39.280]   it's the same workflow.
[00:28:39.280 --> 00:28:41.320]   >> Well, that's one thing that is kind of an issue
[00:28:41.320 --> 00:28:43.240]   for me is workflow, the lack of multitasking.
[00:28:43.240 --> 00:28:45.080]   I'm not lobbying for multitasking,
[00:28:45.080 --> 00:28:46.440]   but you are doing one thing at a time,
[00:28:46.440 --> 00:28:48.600]   and it is a little bit like putting the CD-ROM in,
[00:28:48.600 --> 00:28:50.360]   you can only do that, and there's things,
[00:28:50.360 --> 00:28:52.640]   there's times when, for instance, I'm reading an article,
[00:28:52.640 --> 00:28:54.400]   and there's some great news applications,
[00:28:54.400 --> 00:28:57.120]   I'm using Early Edition, which is a great little RSS reader
[00:28:57.120 --> 00:29:01.040]   that makes a newspaper, but I can't bookmark them
[00:29:01.040 --> 00:29:03.480]   on Delicious, there's workflow issues,
[00:29:03.480 --> 00:29:06.000]   I can't copy and paste content without exiting it
[00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:08.000]   and going to another one and going back.
[00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:09.160]   >> Well, I'm hoping that that's something
[00:29:09.160 --> 00:29:10.200]   they're gonna address on Thursday,
[00:29:10.200 --> 00:29:12.040]   I mean, that's one of the rumors is that we're gonna--
[00:29:12.040 --> 00:29:14.840]   >> I don't see multitasking ever on these platforms.
[00:29:14.840 --> 00:29:19.120]   I mean, there was an interesting article in ours, Technica,
[00:29:19.120 --> 00:29:20.560]   and I don't know, I would love to know
[00:29:20.560 --> 00:29:22.880]   if you guys think this is bogus or real,
[00:29:22.880 --> 00:29:27.240]   but that, I think it was ours, it's submitted that the reason
[00:29:27.240 --> 00:29:29.080]   Apple doesn't put flash in, doesn't put a camera in,
[00:29:29.080 --> 00:29:31.680]   doesn't do multitasking, they can make simpler chipsets
[00:29:31.680 --> 00:29:33.960]   that don't need additional capabilities,
[00:29:33.960 --> 00:29:35.720]   and so they can make lower cost chipsets,
[00:29:35.720 --> 00:29:38.320]   that they may not even, we don't know
[00:29:38.320 --> 00:29:40.000]   what the capabilities of the A4 are,
[00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:43.600]   it may well be that these things just can't do--
[00:29:43.600 --> 00:29:45.760]   >> Well, but certainly they're gonna scale
[00:29:45.760 --> 00:29:46.600]   with the chipsets.
[00:29:46.600 --> 00:29:48.800]   >> Well, the thing that's not a huge issue and--
[00:29:48.800 --> 00:29:50.240]   >> But that's where you get battery life,
[00:29:50.240 --> 00:29:51.360]   that's where you get lower cost,
[00:29:51.360 --> 00:29:53.040]   I mean, there's a reason to do that, right?
[00:29:53.040 --> 00:29:54.440]   >> Right, but I think on the iPad,
[00:29:54.440 --> 00:29:55.880]   I certainly could do multitasking
[00:29:55.880 --> 00:29:57.240]   because of the battery life.
[00:29:57.240 --> 00:29:59.800]   >> But then do you want a product family that says,
[00:29:59.800 --> 00:30:01.680]   okay, well, the battery life is great on this,
[00:30:01.680 --> 00:30:03.120]   but on my iPhone, it sucks.
[00:30:03.120 --> 00:30:05.080]   >> I'll tell you why you don't want to do multitasking,
[00:30:05.080 --> 00:30:07.720]   the UI, one of the things that we all love about this
[00:30:07.720 --> 00:30:09.680]   is the simplicity of the UI.
[00:30:09.680 --> 00:30:12.000]   You can, you know, look, HP's gonna do a slate,
[00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:13.720]   and we're gonna talk about that in a little bit.
[00:30:13.720 --> 00:30:15.000]   It's gonna have Windows 7 on it,
[00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:16.720]   it's gonna have touch, it's gonna have all the same features,
[00:30:16.720 --> 00:30:18.560]   but the complexity of the UI that's introduced
[00:30:18.560 --> 00:30:20.520]   by having a start menu in Windows 7 and all that,
[00:30:20.520 --> 00:30:23.760]   and multitasking really takes away from the elegance.
[00:30:23.760 --> 00:30:26.400]   One of the reasons this is so straightforward and simple
[00:30:26.400 --> 00:30:28.560]   is that it doesn't multitask.
[00:30:28.560 --> 00:30:31.520]   It's very kind of in the term that Apple used
[00:30:31.520 --> 00:30:33.040]   when the Mac first came out.
[00:30:33.040 --> 00:30:35.400]   It's very modal.
[00:30:35.400 --> 00:30:36.720]   >> But I have to admit, my new--
[00:30:36.720 --> 00:30:37.880]   >> I mean, also when you have one,
[00:30:37.880 --> 00:30:41.440]   you have a one window interface to begin with,
[00:30:41.440 --> 00:30:42.880]   so I'm not sure how fast it's gonna be
[00:30:42.880 --> 00:30:45.040]   to switch between one window and another,
[00:30:45.040 --> 00:30:47.320]   unless they try to do a tiling sort of thing,
[00:30:47.320 --> 00:30:49.760]   which basically have a source and a destination
[00:30:49.760 --> 00:30:51.840]   or have like a movie window in one corner while
[00:30:51.840 --> 00:30:54.080]   I'm doing things and other things.
[00:30:54.080 --> 00:30:57.120]   If multitasking does appear, what I would love to see
[00:30:57.120 --> 00:31:00.280]   is just the four iPhone apps at the same time,
[00:31:00.280 --> 00:31:01.480]   like in different quadrants of the window
[00:31:01.480 --> 00:31:04.040]   at the same time, when that'd be cool.
[00:31:04.040 --> 00:31:05.880]   >> Well, I know that my need for multitasking
[00:31:05.880 --> 00:31:08.240]   primarily revolves around Skype on my iPhone
[00:31:08.240 --> 00:31:10.640]   is that it is that it would, or line two,
[00:31:10.640 --> 00:31:11.920]   which are the two that I kind of play with
[00:31:11.920 --> 00:31:14.600]   as far as VoIP goes, is that's the one I really notice it,
[00:31:14.600 --> 00:31:17.160]   is when I'm, you know, I can't make it like a phone.
[00:31:17.160 --> 00:31:18.480]   You know, I can't be talking to someone
[00:31:18.480 --> 00:31:21.000]   and then doing something else and I can't, you know,
[00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:21.840]   that's the whole thing.
[00:31:21.840 --> 00:31:23.720]   And those things are already happening.
[00:31:23.720 --> 00:31:26.600]   And part of me, you know, the conspiracy theory
[00:31:26.600 --> 00:31:29.200]   theorists in me thinks that Apple does that partially
[00:31:29.200 --> 00:31:32.320]   so that you don't end up with Skype
[00:31:32.320 --> 00:31:35.760]   or line two completely replacing my use of the phone.
[00:31:35.760 --> 00:31:36.960]   >> But why should they hear on this one
[00:31:36.960 --> 00:31:39.040]   because this one's not a phone, right?
[00:31:39.040 --> 00:31:41.280]   >> No, I'm not, and I think, I do think
[00:31:41.280 --> 00:31:43.000]   that that's gonna be part of the announcements this week.
[00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:45.280]   And I don't think it's gonna be multitasking.
[00:31:45.280 --> 00:31:47.960]   >> I do, but I think it's gonna come in limited forms.
[00:31:47.960 --> 00:31:51.160]   It's not just gonna be, okay, it's something you can turn on
[00:31:51.160 --> 00:31:54.440]   and your app stays running, it'll be,
[00:31:54.440 --> 00:31:57.760]   your app is able to do things while it's not open.
[00:31:57.760 --> 00:32:01.800]   So I almost feel like the language we use isn't quite right.
[00:32:01.800 --> 00:32:06.360]   Like, we think of multitasking the way computer,
[00:32:06.360 --> 00:32:09.480]   the actual computer implements it with running processes,
[00:32:09.480 --> 00:32:12.520]   launching processes, exiting processes,
[00:32:12.520 --> 00:32:16.360]   quitting, launching, running, and multiple things are running.
[00:32:16.360 --> 00:32:21.440]   With the iPhone interface on the phones and the iPad,
[00:32:21.440 --> 00:32:25.840]   it's really more like open and doing something.
[00:32:25.840 --> 00:32:27.800]   So only one app can be open at a time
[00:32:27.800 --> 00:32:29.800]   because it takes the whole screen.
[00:32:29.800 --> 00:32:32.720]   But apps, some, you know, and the ones from Apple
[00:32:32.720 --> 00:32:35.320]   can still do stuff while they're not open.
[00:32:35.320 --> 00:32:36.880]   >> I can listen to my iPod.
[00:32:36.880 --> 00:32:40.480]   >> Right, so I think what they'll do is add APIs
[00:32:40.480 --> 00:32:45.160]   that allow third party developers to do stuff in the background.
[00:32:45.160 --> 00:32:47.960]   So for example, like it would be absolutely great
[00:32:47.960 --> 00:32:51.920]   if Pandora could do the same thing that the iPod,
[00:32:51.920 --> 00:32:54.920]   that doesn't mean that the full Pandora app
[00:32:54.920 --> 00:32:56.760]   would be running visually, you know,
[00:32:56.760 --> 00:33:00.040]   like in some visual way where you could actually see it
[00:33:00.040 --> 00:33:03.040]   at all times, it would just mean that there's a,
[00:33:03.040 --> 00:33:06.480]   you know, technically there's a process that's streaming audio.
[00:33:06.480 --> 00:33:09.000]   And then if you actually wanted to go back to Pandora,
[00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:10.960]   you'd still have to reopen the actual app
[00:33:10.960 --> 00:33:12.040]   that shows you stuff.
[00:33:12.040 --> 00:33:15.240]   I think the other thing, and I don't have any information
[00:33:15.240 --> 00:33:16.680]   about this, this is just speculation,
[00:33:16.680 --> 00:33:18.320]   but it's sort of how Android works.
[00:33:18.320 --> 00:33:19.600]   And I would like, it would be interesting
[00:33:19.600 --> 00:33:21.560]   if Apple could add something like this,
[00:33:21.560 --> 00:33:25.680]   where an app that isn't open, isn't visible on screen
[00:33:25.680 --> 00:33:27.720]   could be in a suspended state,
[00:33:27.720 --> 00:33:30.600]   where when you next time you open it,
[00:33:30.600 --> 00:33:32.720]   it comes right back where it was.
[00:33:32.720 --> 00:33:35.840]   And you do see this, and I'm not quite sure how they do it,
[00:33:35.840 --> 00:33:38.800]   but you see it kind of like when you get a phone call
[00:33:38.800 --> 00:33:42.400]   on the iPhone, if you accept the call,
[00:33:42.400 --> 00:33:44.080]   all of a sudden you're in the phone,
[00:33:44.080 --> 00:33:45.240]   and then when you end the call--
[00:33:45.240 --> 00:33:46.560]   - The phone call at the top says if you get the phone--
[00:33:46.560 --> 00:33:48.240]   - It's not that the app relaunches,
[00:33:48.240 --> 00:33:51.840]   it was like pickled somehow, you know, in a state.
[00:33:51.840 --> 00:33:54.720]   It would be interesting if they could somehow let,
[00:33:54.720 --> 00:33:56.920]   maybe it would be something that developers would have to,
[00:33:56.920 --> 00:33:59.920]   you know, recompile their apps for the 4.0 OS to do
[00:33:59.920 --> 00:34:01.320]   and support these APIs.
[00:34:01.320 --> 00:34:04.040]   But rather than think of them,
[00:34:04.040 --> 00:34:05.520]   'cause that's a lot of what I wanna do,
[00:34:05.520 --> 00:34:07.640]   is like, for example, I wrote my,
[00:34:07.640 --> 00:34:11.240]   I'm writing my review of the iPad on the iPad in pages.
[00:34:11.240 --> 00:34:12.400]   So a lot of what-- - That's so beautiful.
[00:34:12.400 --> 00:34:14.560]   - That's eating your own dog food, holy cow.
[00:34:14.560 --> 00:34:16.800]   - Oh, it's great, I mean, it's really not, you know,
[00:34:16.800 --> 00:34:18.640]   with the Bluetooth keyboard.
[00:34:18.640 --> 00:34:20.360]   - Right, right. - I'm using Bluetooth keyboard, right.
[00:34:20.360 --> 00:34:22.760]   - But the one thing that I find myself doing over and over again
[00:34:22.760 --> 00:34:25.880]   is going back to Safari to read something,
[00:34:25.880 --> 00:34:29.280]   read somebody else's review, copy a URL to paste into my thing.
[00:34:29.280 --> 00:34:33.000]   And so it doesn't really feel, and I always thought this,
[00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:34.680]   with the iPhone, it doesn't really feel like
[00:34:34.680 --> 00:34:37.080]   you're quitting and launching, quitting and launching.
[00:34:37.080 --> 00:34:39.960]   It's, you know, back to home, back to this app,
[00:34:39.960 --> 00:34:41.480]   back to home, back to this app.
[00:34:41.480 --> 00:34:44.120]   So the home screen, at least if you're not going,
[00:34:44.120 --> 00:34:45.880]   if the two apps you're switching between
[00:34:45.880 --> 00:34:48.200]   are right next to each other on the same home screen,
[00:34:48.200 --> 00:34:49.760]   it kind of is like switching.
[00:34:49.760 --> 00:34:51.400]   I mean, you hit the home button once,
[00:34:51.400 --> 00:34:52.920]   and then you tap the other icon,
[00:34:52.920 --> 00:34:54.640]   you hit the home button, tap the other icon.
[00:34:54.640 --> 00:34:57.000]   And for at least for Safari and pages,
[00:34:57.000 --> 00:34:58.680]   it's really pretty fast.
[00:34:58.680 --> 00:35:03.000]   It's not quite instantaneous, but pages on the iPad
[00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:06.600]   opens back up, you know, whatever document you were editing,
[00:35:06.600 --> 00:35:09.760]   opens right back up to it, and you're pretty much right back
[00:35:09.760 --> 00:35:11.600]   where you left off.
[00:35:11.600 --> 00:35:13.040]   We're going to go ahead.
[00:35:13.040 --> 00:35:14.080]   It actually works pretty well.
[00:35:14.080 --> 00:35:15.720]   I mean, it could be faster though.
[00:35:15.720 --> 00:35:18.880]   It definitely could be faster to get back to where you were.
[00:35:18.880 --> 00:35:20.400]   We're going to take a break, and I want to come back
[00:35:20.400 --> 00:35:23.240]   and talk about what we have so much to talk about.
[00:35:23.240 --> 00:35:24.960]   Maybe let's talk about the things
[00:35:24.960 --> 00:35:27.960]   that you would like to see changed on the iPad.
[00:35:27.960 --> 00:35:31.400]   We also will talk about competitors, the HP Slate.
[00:35:31.400 --> 00:35:34.840]   We're starting to see some specs for that.
[00:35:34.840 --> 00:35:37.240]   And iPhone 4.0, you know, I was thinking,
[00:35:37.240 --> 00:35:39.200]   should we do the show today, or should we wait till Thursday?
[00:35:39.200 --> 00:35:41.320]   And I thought, well, we got plenty to talk about with the iPad,
[00:35:41.320 --> 00:35:43.280]   and maybe we'll just do something on Thursday
[00:35:43.280 --> 00:35:45.960]   after the announcement to do an additional Mac break weekly
[00:35:45.960 --> 00:35:48.160]   special, because there's more than enough
[00:35:48.160 --> 00:35:49.920]   to talk about with the iPad alone today.
[00:35:49.920 --> 00:35:51.720]   And it's kind of fun, our last chance
[00:35:51.720 --> 00:35:54.160]   to speculate about what 4.0 might include.
[00:35:54.160 --> 00:35:55.840]   We'll do more of that as well.
[00:35:55.840 --> 00:35:57.120]   I love speculation.
[00:35:57.120 --> 00:35:59.280]   But before we do that, let's take a little break.
[00:35:59.280 --> 00:36:01.720]   John Gruber is here from Daring Fireball,
[00:36:01.720 --> 00:36:04.160]   Andy Inaco, who's in Colorado for the World Affairs
[00:36:04.160 --> 00:36:04.640]   Council.
[00:36:04.640 --> 00:36:07.240]   He is, of course, with the Chicago Sun times.
[00:36:07.240 --> 00:36:11.320]   Andy also has a website called The Celestial Waste of Bandwidth.
[00:36:11.320 --> 00:36:14.080]   Chris Breen from Macworld, senior editor.
[00:36:14.080 --> 00:36:18.840]   And Alex Lindsay, a big panel today on the show from Pixelcore.com
[00:36:18.840 --> 00:36:21.200]   talking about the new iPad.
[00:36:21.200 --> 00:36:23.480]   But before we do that, a little more of that,
[00:36:23.480 --> 00:36:26.520]   let's talk about GoToMeeting.
[00:36:26.520 --> 00:36:31.160]   Did you see the-- there's a GoToMeeting iPad app, which is awesome.
[00:36:31.160 --> 00:36:35.480]   So now you can be sitting on a park bench in bed
[00:36:35.480 --> 00:36:37.960]   and join a meeting.
[00:36:37.960 --> 00:36:39.520]   I want someone to have a meeting just
[00:36:39.520 --> 00:36:40.760]   so I can play with it a little bit.
[00:36:40.760 --> 00:36:42.560]   Anybody want to have a meeting, please let me know.
[00:36:42.560 --> 00:36:47.400]   GoToMeeting is a way to meet online with Mac users,
[00:36:47.400 --> 00:36:50.000]   Windows users, and now iPad users.
[00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:51.640]   Show them the presentation.
[00:36:51.640 --> 00:36:52.640]   They see your screen.
[00:36:52.640 --> 00:36:53.720]   You can see their screen.
[00:36:53.720 --> 00:36:56.040]   I don't know if the GoToMeeting shares the other way.
[00:36:56.040 --> 00:36:57.920]   Probably doesn't on the iPad.
[00:36:57.920 --> 00:36:59.480]   I'll have to have a meeting and see.
[00:36:59.480 --> 00:37:01.960]   It does on the computer, of course.
[00:37:01.960 --> 00:37:03.880]   Completely secure SSL encryption,
[00:37:03.880 --> 00:37:05.200]   so you're always safe even if you're
[00:37:05.200 --> 00:37:08.320]   an internet cafe sitting there with your iPad on a top secret
[00:37:08.320 --> 00:37:10.080]   meeting.
[00:37:10.080 --> 00:37:12.400]   I just-- I think GoToMeeting is really the best way
[00:37:12.400 --> 00:37:13.040]   to meet online.
[00:37:13.040 --> 00:37:14.320]   If you haven't tried online meetings,
[00:37:14.320 --> 00:37:16.160]   or if you've had online meetings with other products
[00:37:16.160 --> 00:37:19.760]   and not been satisfied, try this one for free for 30 days.
[00:37:19.760 --> 00:37:22.800]   Go to gotoMeeting.com/Macbreak.
[00:37:22.800 --> 00:37:29.440]   GoToMeeting.com/Macbreak and try it free for 30 days.
[00:37:29.440 --> 00:37:33.440]   Citrix is committed to making it easy, fast, and secure,
[00:37:33.440 --> 00:37:35.280]   and they've done such a great job.
[00:37:35.280 --> 00:37:36.360]   Save money.
[00:37:36.360 --> 00:37:38.840]   You've got, by the way, free voice over the internet
[00:37:38.840 --> 00:37:41.800]   and phone teleconferencing built into this.
[00:37:41.800 --> 00:37:42.920]   So you can have your phone.
[00:37:42.920 --> 00:37:44.760]   You can be on your conference call and use your iPad
[00:37:44.760 --> 00:37:45.280]   to go to the meeting.
[00:37:45.280 --> 00:37:46.880]   It's really cool.
[00:37:46.880 --> 00:37:49.640]   GoToMeeting.com/Macbreak.
[00:37:49.640 --> 00:37:53.480]   Daying later in the day, let's have a GoToMeeting
[00:37:53.480 --> 00:37:55.320]   and just to try it.
[00:37:55.320 --> 00:37:59.080]   I just think it's really great that they launched day of.
[00:37:59.080 --> 00:38:00.080]   But I haven't tried it yet.
[00:38:00.080 --> 00:38:04.960]   So it's right here on the GoToMeeting tab.
[00:38:04.960 --> 00:38:06.920]   GoToMeeting.com/Macbreak.
[00:38:06.920 --> 00:38:07.760]   Give it a try today.
[00:38:07.760 --> 00:38:10.240]   You're going to love it.
[00:38:10.240 --> 00:38:16.360]   Macbreak Weekly, our special episode, day one of the iPad era
[00:38:16.360 --> 00:38:20.080]   or something like that, episode one of the iPad era.
[00:38:20.080 --> 00:38:23.520]   Andy Inaco, Alex Lindsey, John Gruber, Chris Breen.
[00:38:23.520 --> 00:38:25.240]   All right, Chris Breen.
[00:38:25.240 --> 00:38:25.600]   Yes.
[00:38:25.600 --> 00:38:28.400]   What's wrong with the iPad?
[00:38:28.400 --> 00:38:30.320]   I've been focusing on media lately.
[00:38:30.320 --> 00:38:33.840]   Just today, iPad is iPod, Article for Macworld.
[00:38:33.840 --> 00:38:36.640]   And there are a couple of little things that--
[00:38:36.640 --> 00:38:37.320]   Bug me.
[00:38:37.320 --> 00:38:39.760]   One is in the video's application is there's
[00:38:39.760 --> 00:38:41.240]   no brightness control.
[00:38:41.240 --> 00:38:45.040]   And I've ripped DVDs that I own and put them on there.
[00:38:45.040 --> 00:38:47.360]   And I was watching the latest Harry Potter.
[00:38:47.360 --> 00:38:49.120]   And it's pretty dark.
[00:38:49.120 --> 00:38:50.080]   But that's dark anyway.
[00:38:50.080 --> 00:38:55.280]   I've watched it on a Blu-ray, on a Pioneer Plasma.
[00:38:55.280 --> 00:38:56.280]   And I'm still going--
[00:38:56.280 --> 00:38:57.080]   I can't see.
[00:38:57.080 --> 00:38:59.200]   Where's going on?
[00:38:59.200 --> 00:39:00.360]   But it's really, really dark.
[00:39:00.360 --> 00:39:01.320]   I know you want to turn it up.
[00:39:01.320 --> 00:39:01.880]   I understand.
[00:39:01.880 --> 00:39:04.440]   And so instead of having a brightness control
[00:39:04.440 --> 00:39:07.640]   within the video app, you have to dash over to Settings,
[00:39:07.640 --> 00:39:09.120]   adjust the video brightness.
[00:39:09.120 --> 00:39:10.080]   There, come back.
[00:39:10.080 --> 00:39:11.440]   Actually, that's too bright.
[00:39:11.440 --> 00:39:12.040]   Let me go back.
[00:39:12.040 --> 00:39:12.640]   I did it here.
[00:39:12.640 --> 00:39:15.040]   And no, no, that's not quite right either.
[00:39:15.040 --> 00:39:17.240]   So it would be nice to have brightness control directly
[00:39:17.240 --> 00:39:18.960]   in the video app.
[00:39:18.960 --> 00:39:20.760]   They do have it in the book reader app.
[00:39:20.760 --> 00:39:22.760]   And it really makes a big difference.
[00:39:22.760 --> 00:39:24.160]   I find I want to turn it down a lot.
[00:39:24.160 --> 00:39:26.320]   It's weird reading a glowing book.
[00:39:26.320 --> 00:39:28.080]   Yeah, and that makes sense, because you don't really
[00:39:28.080 --> 00:39:30.080]   want to book beaming at you late at night
[00:39:30.080 --> 00:39:31.480]   when you're in a dark room.
[00:39:31.480 --> 00:39:32.400]   But the same with video.
[00:39:32.400 --> 00:39:34.640]   You do want that kind of controller video as well.
[00:39:34.640 --> 00:39:36.400]   And then also on a device this size,
[00:39:36.400 --> 00:39:39.760]   as much as Apple has been pushing cover flow
[00:39:39.760 --> 00:39:44.680]   in the Finder, in iTunes, even on the iPod and the iPod
[00:39:44.680 --> 00:39:47.000]   Touch and the iPhone, it's not on here.
[00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:48.640]   And now it actually happens.
[00:39:48.640 --> 00:39:51.000]   It is weird to me that I actually have room now
[00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:53.080]   to do this kind of thing and go, oh, let me look
[00:39:53.080 --> 00:39:54.520]   at my album covers.
[00:39:54.520 --> 00:39:55.360]   And it's not there.
[00:39:55.360 --> 00:39:58.920]   Now, maybe because of this, that you're constantly flipping views.
[00:39:58.920 --> 00:40:02.320]   And on the iPhone, when you do that, oh, now I'm in cover flow.
[00:40:02.320 --> 00:40:05.120]   But they want to give you that broader, wider experience
[00:40:05.120 --> 00:40:07.080]   for the iPod interface.
[00:40:07.080 --> 00:40:09.600]   But I would like the option to actually tap a button,
[00:40:09.600 --> 00:40:10.840]   bring it up and say, yes, I actually
[00:40:10.840 --> 00:40:12.840]   would like to try cover flow on this device,
[00:40:12.840 --> 00:40:14.520]   because I think it would look great,
[00:40:14.520 --> 00:40:17.200]   particularly when the album art, at least the stuff from iTunes
[00:40:17.200 --> 00:40:19.000]   store scales up so beautifully.
[00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:20.640]   It really is just on here.
[00:40:20.640 --> 00:40:23.440]   Stuff you get yourself that's tiny--
[00:40:23.440 --> 00:40:26.720]   We got a message from Apple--
[00:40:26.720 --> 00:40:28.320]   oh, was it about six months ago?
[00:40:28.320 --> 00:40:35.200]   Dane saying, do hire res album art for your podcast?
[00:40:35.200 --> 00:40:38.240]   And they said, we want to have hire res album art.
[00:40:38.240 --> 00:40:40.760]   We just think it's a good idea, because the max that we're
[00:40:40.760 --> 00:40:42.320]   doing was 600 by 600.
[00:40:42.320 --> 00:40:44.040]   And so we started sending them--
[00:40:44.040 --> 00:40:45.840]   what was the resolution we started saying?
[00:40:45.840 --> 00:40:46.800]   I'm much duff.
[00:40:46.800 --> 00:40:48.360]   It was just a different message for us to be doing it.
[00:40:48.360 --> 00:40:49.480]   We went even bigger.
[00:40:49.480 --> 00:40:50.440]   Yeah.
[00:40:50.440 --> 00:40:52.720]   Sometimes they say stuff like, what
[00:40:52.720 --> 00:40:56.600]   would you think if we told you that we wanted--
[00:40:56.600 --> 00:40:58.520]   1200 by 1200 album art?
[00:40:58.520 --> 00:40:59.000]   They don't.
[00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:00.000]   Why would you think about that?
[00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:00.400]   What would you think about it?
[00:41:00.400 --> 00:41:02.600]   What would you say?
[00:41:02.600 --> 00:41:03.440]   I didn't think of it.
[00:41:03.440 --> 00:41:04.600]   Think of that.
[00:41:04.600 --> 00:41:05.080]   I got--
[00:41:05.080 --> 00:41:06.600]   But yeah, I have to think, Chris, they're
[00:41:06.600 --> 00:41:07.760]   going to put cover flow in.
[00:41:07.760 --> 00:41:09.000]   It's weird that it's not there.
[00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:11.000]   I can't think of any reason not to have it.
[00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:14.520]   It does seem weird to me, again, because I find it so useless
[00:41:14.520 --> 00:41:16.360]   everywhere else.
[00:41:16.360 --> 00:41:18.160]   Useless everywhere else.
[00:41:18.160 --> 00:41:18.640]   I do.
[00:41:18.640 --> 00:41:20.640]   I just don't use it ever.
[00:41:20.640 --> 00:41:22.360]   And maybe that's gotten through it,
[00:41:22.360 --> 00:41:24.200]   and they go, well, yeah, this is a very slick looking thing,
[00:41:24.200 --> 00:41:25.440]   but nobody uses it.
[00:41:25.440 --> 00:41:26.080]   They bought it.
[00:41:26.080 --> 00:41:27.160]   That was something they bought, right?
[00:41:27.160 --> 00:41:28.000]   It was not a position.
[00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:28.360]   Yeah.
[00:41:28.360 --> 00:41:31.080]   But I would think that actually on a device
[00:41:31.080 --> 00:41:32.760]   where it makes sense, it isn't there.
[00:41:32.760 --> 00:41:34.880]   So that seemed strange to me.
[00:41:34.880 --> 00:41:37.120]   Yeah, it does.
[00:41:37.120 --> 00:41:39.600]   Mr. Lindsey, what's missing?
[00:41:39.600 --> 00:41:40.360]   What would you change?
[00:41:40.360 --> 00:41:41.920]   What would you fix?
[00:41:41.920 --> 00:41:44.760]   I think that-- well, for a lot of the applications,
[00:41:44.760 --> 00:41:46.960]   I'd say that you were obviously-- that they made them
[00:41:46.960 --> 00:41:48.200]   when they weren't--
[00:41:48.200 --> 00:41:48.960]   they didn't have one.
[00:41:48.960 --> 00:41:49.880]   There's some really buggy.
[00:41:49.880 --> 00:41:51.440]   Yeah, there's some really buggy ones.
[00:41:51.440 --> 00:41:53.000]   It seems like display issues.
[00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:55.840]   Yeah, and also just lots of user interface stuff
[00:41:55.840 --> 00:41:57.440]   that probably made sense when you were clicking it
[00:41:57.440 --> 00:42:00.360]   and doesn't make sense so much when you're playing it.
[00:42:00.360 --> 00:42:06.720]   But I think that for me, being able to print from it
[00:42:06.720 --> 00:42:08.880]   is something that actually has already shown up for me.
[00:42:08.880 --> 00:42:09.880]   Huge.
[00:42:09.880 --> 00:42:11.920]   Yeah, that was the number one thing for me.
[00:42:11.920 --> 00:42:15.000]   I immediately-- I wrote something out on the plane.
[00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:17.120]   And when I got to the house, I wanted to just go on a Wi-Fi
[00:42:17.120 --> 00:42:17.920]   and work and print.
[00:42:17.920 --> 00:42:19.840]   And then there's a little bit of a rig and roll
[00:42:19.840 --> 00:42:21.160]   that is required to get it off.
[00:42:21.160 --> 00:42:22.000]   And I--
[00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:24.480]   Basically, you need a Mac to print, right?
[00:42:24.480 --> 00:42:26.400]   Yeah, I think that's going to show up
[00:42:26.400 --> 00:42:28.760]   as a problem for people, because I think there are people
[00:42:28.760 --> 00:42:31.920]   that are going to have their Mac at home or at their office,
[00:42:31.920 --> 00:42:34.160]   or PC or whatever it is.
[00:42:34.160 --> 00:42:35.400]   They're going to want to sync to it,
[00:42:35.400 --> 00:42:37.440]   but they are really not going to want to carry it around
[00:42:37.440 --> 00:42:38.760]   all the time, but they're business people.
[00:42:38.760 --> 00:42:41.040]   And it's going to be this issue.
[00:42:41.040 --> 00:42:43.480]   And you'd think, well, maybe I'll just use Google Docs
[00:42:43.480 --> 00:42:44.560]   and then try to find someone.
[00:42:44.560 --> 00:42:46.560]   But right now, the Google Docs, the way that edits, at least
[00:42:46.560 --> 00:42:48.440]   the way it shows up on the iPad right now,
[00:42:48.440 --> 00:42:50.360]   it does not really editable.
[00:42:50.360 --> 00:42:52.840]   I had to download an app for that.
[00:42:52.840 --> 00:42:55.120]   And in fact, I downloaded some apps for printing,
[00:42:55.120 --> 00:42:56.640]   none of which really worked very well.
[00:42:56.640 --> 00:42:58.880]   But I'm sure there will be third party.
[00:42:58.880 --> 00:43:01.280]   If you have a networked printer, I'm sure
[00:43:01.280 --> 00:43:02.560]   there will be third party solutions to print.
[00:43:02.560 --> 00:43:05.480]   It just seems like-- it was one of those things
[00:43:05.480 --> 00:43:07.600]   that was a little boggling for me that Apple wouldn't just
[00:43:07.600 --> 00:43:08.160]   put that in.
[00:43:08.160 --> 00:43:10.440]   I mean, they have a great system for that already.
[00:43:10.440 --> 00:43:11.680]   When you're on a network and being
[00:43:11.680 --> 00:43:13.600]   able to just find a printer on the network and print it,
[00:43:13.600 --> 00:43:14.960]   just-- I understand.
[00:43:14.960 --> 00:43:16.160]   And I got a lot of memory.
[00:43:16.160 --> 00:43:17.160]   I mean, I got the bigger one.
[00:43:17.160 --> 00:43:19.360]   But I mean, I got a lot of-- I'm fine with the printer drivers.
[00:43:19.360 --> 00:43:22.800]   You can put them on whatever I need to do to do that.
[00:43:22.800 --> 00:43:23.880]   I'm willing to do it.
[00:43:23.880 --> 00:43:25.200]   You can give me a warning about it.
[00:43:25.200 --> 00:43:29.120]   But let me choose to be able to print from pages.
[00:43:29.120 --> 00:43:31.760]   It just seemed-- that was a little frustrating for me.
[00:43:31.760 --> 00:43:33.960]   Andy Inaco, what--
[00:43:33.960 --> 00:43:36.560]   oh, I'm sorry, Andy's having a conversation with a gert.
[00:43:36.560 --> 00:43:37.360]   I'm sorry.
[00:43:37.360 --> 00:43:41.120]   Andy, you're so cagedy.
[00:43:41.120 --> 00:43:41.960]   You still have that talk.
[00:43:41.960 --> 00:43:43.040]   You were so cagedy.
[00:43:43.040 --> 00:43:44.680]   You were so funny.
[00:43:44.680 --> 00:43:46.560]   I haven't talked to you since then.
[00:43:46.560 --> 00:43:49.040]   When did you get the iPad?
[00:43:49.040 --> 00:43:51.400]   It was before last week, right?
[00:43:51.400 --> 00:43:52.360]   It was before last week.
[00:43:52.360 --> 00:43:57.280]   It was the Thursday, the week before the actual release.
[00:43:57.280 --> 00:44:01.560]   And somebody sent me a screenshot of you and said, look,
[00:44:01.560 --> 00:44:03.680]   there's the box right behind him.
[00:44:03.680 --> 00:44:04.400]   Was that the box?
[00:44:04.400 --> 00:44:05.560]   Was that actually the box?
[00:44:05.560 --> 00:44:08.320]   Did you leave a clue, or was that just an accident?
[00:44:08.320 --> 00:44:09.800]   No, that would be--
[00:44:09.800 --> 00:44:12.160]   I think you were pretty careful.
[00:44:12.160 --> 00:44:17.520]   I can tell you that for a fact, because the Apple gave me
[00:44:17.520 --> 00:44:21.120]   the iPad, then the box that has the keyboard in it,
[00:44:21.120 --> 00:44:23.320]   and the box that had that in it, the box that had that in it.
[00:44:23.320 --> 00:44:25.920]   It was all inside like an Apple Store bag,
[00:44:25.920 --> 00:44:26.960]   so that I could just--
[00:44:26.960 --> 00:44:28.880]   family season, I'll just spend a Apple Store
[00:44:28.880 --> 00:44:30.080]   buying a bunch of stuff.
[00:44:30.080 --> 00:44:33.320]   But I really wanted to just hide it completely inside my backpack.
[00:44:33.320 --> 00:44:34.520]   And I just couldn't do it.
[00:44:34.520 --> 00:44:37.320]   So I took every-- all the boxes, all that stuff came in,
[00:44:37.320 --> 00:44:38.720]   left behind in my friend's house,
[00:44:38.720 --> 00:44:41.400]   where I was staying during that little trip.
[00:44:41.400 --> 00:44:45.600]   So believe me, there were complete white out conditions
[00:44:45.600 --> 00:44:46.600]   inside my office that week.
[00:44:46.600 --> 00:44:48.160]   No, you were--
[00:44:48.160 --> 00:44:51.320]   If Apple's listening, he was very good.
[00:44:51.320 --> 00:44:52.560]   He was very good.
[00:44:52.560 --> 00:44:54.320]   See, it did.
[00:44:54.320 --> 00:44:56.600]   Yeah, I mean, if you ask me a direct question,
[00:44:56.600 --> 00:44:58.560]   I will try to parry it and parry it and parry it.
[00:44:58.560 --> 00:45:03.320]   But at some point, I was trying to avoid the line to you
[00:45:03.320 --> 00:45:05.000]   and saying that I did not have one of those.
[00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:07.000]   I don't think you ever lied to us.
[00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:10.120]   I think you never lied to us, but you did it in such a way
[00:45:10.120 --> 00:45:12.600]   that you made it seem like you didn't
[00:45:12.600 --> 00:45:14.960]   want to admit that you didn't have one.
[00:45:14.960 --> 00:45:17.200]   You were very clever about it.
[00:45:17.200 --> 00:45:20.520]   And again, I'm not exactly a chimp up here.
[00:45:20.520 --> 00:45:21.680]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:45:21.680 --> 00:45:23.120]   It's just these girls.
[00:45:23.120 --> 00:45:24.080]   They're all processing.
[00:45:24.080 --> 00:45:25.360]   You did a great job.
[00:45:25.360 --> 00:45:28.080]   You totally fooled me.
[00:45:28.080 --> 00:45:28.640]   Thank you.
[00:45:28.640 --> 00:45:31.240]   I hate for having asked me that question every single week
[00:45:31.240 --> 00:45:32.080]   for about a month.
[00:45:32.080 --> 00:45:33.840]   I'm sorry, but we had to.
[00:45:33.840 --> 00:45:34.920]   That's the-- you had to.
[00:45:34.920 --> 00:45:36.280]   You had to do what you had to do.
[00:45:36.280 --> 00:45:38.440]   I had to do what you had to do.
[00:45:38.440 --> 00:45:40.720]   Let's drink that and remain friends.
[00:45:40.720 --> 00:45:41.600]   And you-- no, no.
[00:45:41.600 --> 00:45:43.520]   And I certainly don't hold it against you.
[00:45:43.520 --> 00:45:45.600]   I know that that's, you know, that's, of course, what you had to do.
[00:45:45.600 --> 00:45:48.280]   And I'm thrilled that you had one.
[00:45:48.280 --> 00:45:49.960]   You gave us a great scoop.
[00:45:49.960 --> 00:45:53.760]   As soon as that embargo was lifted, 9 p.m. Eastern time
[00:45:53.760 --> 00:45:57.240]   on Friday, you were on the air here at live.tuit.tv.
[00:45:57.240 --> 00:45:59.480]   We've got, by the way, the video of that.
[00:45:59.480 --> 00:46:02.840]   You have a great unboxing, which I presume you shot
[00:46:02.840 --> 00:46:05.360]   before the embargo was lifted and then released on YouTube.
[00:46:05.360 --> 00:46:06.760]   But then--
[00:46:06.760 --> 00:46:07.240]   Yep.
[00:46:07.240 --> 00:46:09.960]   And then on our YouTube channel, youtube.com/twit,
[00:46:09.960 --> 00:46:12.920]   we also have Andy's first review with Alex.
[00:46:12.920 --> 00:46:15.520]   You and Alex did a review because I was out of the studio.
[00:46:15.520 --> 00:46:19.000]   So thank you because you gave us a very early review.
[00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:20.080]   So we really appreciate that.
[00:46:20.080 --> 00:46:20.920]   I think thanks to Andy.
[00:46:20.920 --> 00:46:22.280]   We had-- I mean, I think that was some of the most
[00:46:22.280 --> 00:46:26.800]   thorough coverage of the iPad launch the day when it was available.
[00:46:26.800 --> 00:46:29.920]   You know, and I was really-- I was really having fun.
[00:46:29.920 --> 00:46:31.040]   Just-- just--
[00:46:31.040 --> 00:46:32.120]   I can't believe over--
[00:46:32.120 --> 00:46:32.560]   Oh, yeah.
[00:46:32.560 --> 00:46:33.840]   Oh, yeah.
[00:46:33.840 --> 00:46:37.880]   So I just-- the Apple just-- the case arrived, the Apple case.
[00:46:37.880 --> 00:46:39.400]   Boy, this is a piece of crap.
[00:46:39.400 --> 00:46:40.280]   OK, just--
[00:46:40.280 --> 00:46:42.200]   But I throw that out there.
[00:46:42.200 --> 00:46:44.040]   It's like-- it's like-- this is ridiculous.
[00:46:44.040 --> 00:46:45.760]   Somebody posted it.
[00:46:45.760 --> 00:46:49.840]   It's like rubbing your iPad with ashes to put it in this thing.
[00:46:49.840 --> 00:46:52.080]   I have a case from a griffin that they sent.
[00:46:52.080 --> 00:46:53.560]   I've been getting cases from everybody.
[00:46:53.560 --> 00:46:56.520]   This is a pretty nice faux leather sleeve that
[00:46:56.520 --> 00:46:57.360]   goes around it.
[00:46:57.360 --> 00:46:58.480]   It makes it-- you know what's nice?
[00:46:58.480 --> 00:46:59.680]   It doesn't look like an iPad.
[00:46:59.680 --> 00:47:01.720]   It looks like you're holding a folio.
[00:47:01.720 --> 00:47:02.720]   This has got an Apple.
[00:47:02.720 --> 00:47:05.400]   I guess someone made one that makes it look like a moleskin.
[00:47:05.400 --> 00:47:06.800]   Ooh, I like that.
[00:47:06.800 --> 00:47:08.160]   Yeah, I was like, oh, I could--
[00:47:08.160 --> 00:47:11.240]   But this does respond to the one thing which I don't like.
[00:47:11.240 --> 00:47:12.200]   And you're right, John.
[00:47:12.200 --> 00:47:13.400]   You can put it flat.
[00:47:13.400 --> 00:47:15.440]   But I do want to tilt it a little bit.
[00:47:15.440 --> 00:47:17.080]   And I think this-- the Apple case
[00:47:17.080 --> 00:47:19.480]   does have that little kickstand.
[00:47:19.480 --> 00:47:22.360]   Yeah, and that's how I used it to write--
[00:47:22.360 --> 00:47:23.200]   Right.
[00:47:23.200 --> 00:47:25.680]   --review on it is I have it in that case
[00:47:25.680 --> 00:47:30.280]   propped up in landscape mode with a Bluetooth keyboard
[00:47:30.280 --> 00:47:30.960]   right in front of it.
[00:47:30.960 --> 00:47:32.040]   And it's a perfect angle.
[00:47:32.040 --> 00:47:34.160]   It really is.
[00:47:34.160 --> 00:47:35.160]   Yeah, and I think--
[00:47:35.160 --> 00:47:37.200]   I think for hosting shows, I think
[00:47:37.200 --> 00:47:40.000]   that that little propped up angle is like perfect.
[00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:41.320]   It does get the way.
[00:47:41.320 --> 00:47:44.080]   The tech TV set with the little monitors all pointed up.
[00:47:44.080 --> 00:47:46.360]   I was like, this could make it a lot easier.
[00:47:46.360 --> 00:47:47.240]   I had the same reaction.
[00:47:47.240 --> 00:47:49.200]   OK, Andy, what don't you like?
[00:47:49.200 --> 00:47:53.440]   OK, there are two holistic things, the system-wide
[00:47:53.440 --> 00:47:54.680]   that I'd like to change.
[00:47:54.680 --> 00:47:57.120]   Number one, I really wish that the built-in apps were
[00:47:57.120 --> 00:47:58.920]   a little bit more ambitious.
[00:47:58.920 --> 00:48:00.880]   It seems as though they were just trying
[00:48:00.880 --> 00:48:03.600]   to scale up the iPhone apps without the awareness that,
[00:48:03.600 --> 00:48:05.000]   gee, I've got this big screen, gee,
[00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:07.360]   I've got a type of a keyboard.
[00:48:07.360 --> 00:48:09.440]   And gee, I probably have higher expectations
[00:48:09.440 --> 00:48:11.960]   of this device than I have of my iPhone.
[00:48:11.960 --> 00:48:15.200]   I'm very, very surprised, for instance, that in the iPod app,
[00:48:15.200 --> 00:48:18.280]   I can't simply tap button on this device and say,
[00:48:18.280 --> 00:48:21.200]   please refresh every single podcast that you see on this device
[00:48:21.200 --> 00:48:21.920]   right now.
[00:48:21.920 --> 00:48:23.440]   Yeah, isn't that shocking?
[00:48:23.440 --> 00:48:24.200]   It still includes the--
[00:48:24.200 --> 00:48:25.560]   Yeah, all that shocking, but it just seems
[00:48:25.560 --> 00:48:27.320]   like such an obvious missed opportunity.
[00:48:27.320 --> 00:48:28.960]   You can still do the thing where you--
[00:48:28.960 --> 00:48:30.320]   if you have that listed in the--
[00:48:30.320 --> 00:48:33.080]   in the list of-- in the podcast, there's still
[00:48:33.080 --> 00:48:34.400]   that little item at the bottom that says,
[00:48:34.400 --> 00:48:37.760]   go get more podcasts, which cases will load in the iTunes app
[00:48:37.760 --> 00:48:38.960]   and download it from there.
[00:48:38.960 --> 00:48:41.000]   But geez, that's not what I want to be doing
[00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:43.440]   like in the last half hour before I got to check out
[00:48:43.440 --> 00:48:46.200]   of my hotel and make it to my plane.
[00:48:46.200 --> 00:48:48.440]   So that's sort of across the board.
[00:48:48.440 --> 00:48:52.200]   Most like Safari can also be more muscular that way.
[00:48:52.200 --> 00:48:53.960]   The way that I was much--
[00:48:53.960 --> 00:48:56.640]   I was much rather have like a split pane manager
[00:48:56.640 --> 00:48:58.200]   for managing my bookmarks.
[00:48:58.200 --> 00:49:01.440]   I would have a lot to have a much better way of managing
[00:49:01.440 --> 00:49:03.720]   multiple issues at the same time.
[00:49:03.720 --> 00:49:05.120]   That's not a multitasking issue that's
[00:49:05.120 --> 00:49:06.880]   all happening within this one app.
[00:49:06.880 --> 00:49:10.640]   So it does look like-- it's a 1.0,
[00:49:10.640 --> 00:49:13.120]   but you don't say that in terms of it's not functional.
[00:49:13.120 --> 00:49:17.200]   It's just 1.0 in terms of they were just desperate to get
[00:49:17.200 --> 00:49:19.240]   this thing done, get this thing stable, ship it,
[00:49:19.240 --> 00:49:21.640]   and then go back to see their husbands and wives and children
[00:49:21.640 --> 00:49:23.640]   and pets for the first time in three months.
[00:49:23.640 --> 00:49:25.960]   I think that we'll see the next iteration.
[00:49:25.960 --> 00:49:28.360]   We'll start to see more blooming features.
[00:49:28.360 --> 00:49:29.720]   The second thing I really want to see
[00:49:29.720 --> 00:49:33.080]   is that this thing really wants to have an application on it
[00:49:33.080 --> 00:49:35.000]   just called Flash Drive.
[00:49:35.000 --> 00:49:38.720]   That's nothing but a folder for your personal documents.
[00:49:38.720 --> 00:49:41.720]   And the documents off of your desktop
[00:49:41.720 --> 00:49:43.320]   are out of the world and into this device
[00:49:43.320 --> 00:49:44.920]   where you can do useful things with them.
[00:49:44.920 --> 00:49:46.520]   But nothing is as useful as simply saying,
[00:49:46.520 --> 00:49:48.400]   here is an application.
[00:49:48.400 --> 00:49:50.320]   Once you have this application running,
[00:49:50.320 --> 00:49:53.000]   you can get stuff from your eye disc and put it in there.
[00:49:53.000 --> 00:49:56.280]   You can mount it via USB and copy documents on there.
[00:49:56.280 --> 00:49:59.600]   It can be a central storage house for a clearing house for.
[00:49:59.600 --> 00:50:01.960]   When you have documents that are just there to be stored
[00:50:01.960 --> 00:50:04.280]   and viewed, you can just toss a PDF
[00:50:04.280 --> 00:50:07.240]   of your flight plans on there, tap it just to use the quick view
[00:50:07.240 --> 00:50:09.680]   feature just to read it and close it once again.
[00:50:09.680 --> 00:50:13.400]   But also as a way of using that sort of as a way station
[00:50:13.400 --> 00:50:16.120]   so that you copied a whole bunch of files from your desktop
[00:50:16.120 --> 00:50:18.960]   before you left home or you copied a whole bunch of files
[00:50:18.960 --> 00:50:21.720]   from your Dropbox or from your box.net account.
[00:50:21.720 --> 00:50:22.720]   And that's where you're keeping them
[00:50:22.720 --> 00:50:25.440]   so that they're permanently on your local storage
[00:50:25.440 --> 00:50:27.920]   so you don't need to connect to the internet to get access to.
[00:50:27.920 --> 00:50:29.800]   But then there comes a time where you want to open it up
[00:50:29.800 --> 00:50:31.840]   in pages or your other word processor.
[00:50:31.840 --> 00:50:34.160]   And that's when you simply go, OK, I don't want to just
[00:50:34.160 --> 00:50:36.680]   read this, I want to edit this, tap and open it
[00:50:36.680 --> 00:50:38.080]   in the preferred document.
[00:50:38.080 --> 00:50:40.480]   It's such a-- there are a bunch of different applications
[00:50:40.480 --> 00:50:43.680]   that are trying to get that--
[00:50:43.680 --> 00:50:46.920]   get that monster.
[00:50:46.920 --> 00:50:48.400]   And just like I was threatening, I've just--
[00:50:48.400 --> 00:50:51.080]   I've downloaded two or three different apps like that,
[00:50:51.080 --> 00:50:53.520]   including some of the most popular and useful apps that
[00:50:53.520 --> 00:50:54.920]   do that on the iPhone.
[00:50:54.920 --> 00:50:57.120]   And they don't really work all that well.
[00:50:57.120 --> 00:50:59.120]   And then I won't mention names because I think
[00:50:59.120 --> 00:51:01.480]   that they really rush to get these things out.
[00:51:01.480 --> 00:51:04.680]   And that was proven-- that was proven, I email these--
[00:51:04.680 --> 00:51:05.720]   the developers directly.
[00:51:05.720 --> 00:51:07.320]   And they said, yeah, that doesn't really
[00:51:07.320 --> 00:51:08.440]   work the way we wanted to.
[00:51:08.440 --> 00:51:10.840]   We really wanted to have this out by April 1.
[00:51:10.840 --> 00:51:14.720]   We're coming up in two weeks now that we have an iPad to play with.
[00:51:14.720 --> 00:51:16.200]   But that doesn't seem like the sort of thing
[00:51:16.200 --> 00:51:17.840]   that a third party should have to cover.
[00:51:17.840 --> 00:51:20.760]   It seems like a basic core function of the iPad.
[00:51:20.760 --> 00:51:23.400]   I don't miss the fact that it doesn't have an open file system.
[00:51:23.400 --> 00:51:26.320]   But this is obviously a gap that they need to cover.
[00:51:26.320 --> 00:51:27.360]   Have you tried GoodReader?
[00:51:27.360 --> 00:51:28.640]   Because that seems to--
[00:51:28.640 --> 00:51:33.040]   I've been using that as a stopgap for--
[00:51:33.040 --> 00:51:36.840]   And it's interesting to watch it rise up to the top of the page.
[00:51:36.840 --> 00:51:38.400]   It's such a kind of outlier.
[00:51:38.400 --> 00:51:43.160]   And all of a sudden, it's number two on the paid apps list.
[00:51:43.160 --> 00:51:46.080]   Yeah, I mean, I've got the Pi hopes for Air Sharing Pro
[00:51:46.080 --> 00:51:49.040]   because it has the full suite of functions that I would want,
[00:51:49.040 --> 00:51:51.200]   including printing, including connecting
[00:51:51.200 --> 00:51:55.440]   to any sort of a cloud storage system, almost any cloud storage system
[00:51:55.440 --> 00:51:57.920]   you can name.
[00:51:57.920 --> 00:51:59.880]   We just need someone who gets to the top of the hill really,
[00:51:59.880 --> 00:52:00.960]   really quickly.
[00:52:00.960 --> 00:52:03.000]   Box.net has an interesting approach, though,
[00:52:03.000 --> 00:52:06.760]   because they have open APIs for their cloud storage.
[00:52:06.760 --> 00:52:10.320]   And they're marking them, promoting them pretty aggressively
[00:52:10.320 --> 00:52:11.800]   in the developer community.
[00:52:11.800 --> 00:52:14.680]   That means that when QuickOffice, or any other third party
[00:52:14.680 --> 00:52:16.880]   Microsoft Office week gets released,
[00:52:16.880 --> 00:52:20.800]   they can incorporate built-in support for Box.net, for instance.
[00:52:20.800 --> 00:52:23.120]   So if you're using Box as your cloud storage,
[00:52:23.120 --> 00:52:25.520]   you don't even need to do any sort of an import export
[00:52:25.520 --> 00:52:26.680]   through a Box.net app.
[00:52:26.680 --> 00:52:30.400]   You can simply open up your Office Suite,
[00:52:30.400 --> 00:52:34.320]   do import button, and there will be a tab for Box.net.
[00:52:34.320 --> 00:52:35.240]   Tap on Box.net.
[00:52:35.240 --> 00:52:35.520]   Great.
[00:52:35.520 --> 00:52:38.400]   Here's a list of all your Box.net documents for your desktop
[00:52:38.400 --> 00:52:39.920]   and just open up your Word file.
[00:52:39.920 --> 00:52:42.720]   That's what's possible with all these APIs.
[00:52:42.720 --> 00:52:44.160]   It is a glaring--
[00:52:44.160 --> 00:52:44.960]   Oh, I've always--
[00:52:44.960 --> 00:52:45.360]   Yeah, it's really good.
[00:52:45.360 --> 00:52:46.240]   Just to wind this up.
[00:52:46.240 --> 00:52:46.680]   Oh, go ahead.
[00:52:46.680 --> 00:52:48.920]   And it's really, like I said, I'm sorry.
[00:52:48.920 --> 00:52:50.120]   I've got enough of a bit of a rinse there.
[00:52:50.120 --> 00:52:51.920]   But just to wind it up, I've always
[00:52:51.920 --> 00:52:53.640]   said that I think that there are going
[00:52:53.640 --> 00:52:55.320]   to be two different editions of the iPad.
[00:52:55.320 --> 00:52:58.680]   The iPad that exists today when it actually ships.
[00:52:58.680 --> 00:53:00.560]   And one that exists three or four months from now
[00:53:00.560 --> 00:53:03.480]   when all the developers finally have not only their hands
[00:53:03.480 --> 00:53:05.360]   on actual iPads, but they have a time
[00:53:05.360 --> 00:53:08.000]   to really figure out what versions of the apps really
[00:53:08.000 --> 00:53:10.120]   make sense and how to build them properly.
[00:53:10.120 --> 00:53:12.520]   Even if they don't update the operating system, Apple,
[00:53:12.520 --> 00:53:14.320]   for the next three or four months,
[00:53:14.320 --> 00:53:15.880]   just the fact that in a couple months' time,
[00:53:15.880 --> 00:53:18.520]   we're going to see the first generation of fully mature apps
[00:53:18.520 --> 00:53:21.000]   for the device is going to transform how useful we find
[00:53:21.000 --> 00:53:22.720]   this thing.
[00:53:22.720 --> 00:53:25.320]   Somebody, I'm getting a chat room updates
[00:53:25.320 --> 00:53:30.960]   on a variety of subjects, including the fact that Dodo case,
[00:53:30.960 --> 00:53:36.640]   DoDOCA, C-A-S-E, is the case that is the Moloskinay case.
[00:53:36.640 --> 00:53:38.160]   It's made of bamboo.
[00:53:38.160 --> 00:53:39.440]   It looks beautiful.
[00:53:39.440 --> 00:53:43.080]   Somebody would think you have a Jumbo Moloskinay, basically.
[00:53:43.080 --> 00:53:45.200]   Is it Pussy Free Bamboo?
[00:53:45.200 --> 00:53:46.280]   It is, in fact.
[00:53:46.280 --> 00:53:50.800]   They say cruelty free or something like that, environmentally
[00:53:50.800 --> 00:53:51.600]   friendly.
[00:53:51.600 --> 00:53:54.960]   And somebody's already-- this is a good idea,
[00:53:54.960 --> 00:54:00.720]   according to Gagit, mounted an iPad into a car dashboard.
[00:54:00.720 --> 00:54:03.360]   Now, I think this is something that they should--
[00:54:03.360 --> 00:54:05.160]   I mean, we've talked about this on the show before,
[00:54:05.160 --> 00:54:06.200]   but I really think this is something
[00:54:06.200 --> 00:54:08.000]   the car manufacturer should make as an option.
[00:54:08.000 --> 00:54:11.360]   I'm just leaving the ability to do it.
[00:54:11.360 --> 00:54:13.720]   I'd pay the same amount that I was going to pay for the GPS
[00:54:13.720 --> 00:54:16.760]   unit for them just to build that into it.
[00:54:16.760 --> 00:54:19.120]   So I guess this is a custom company down in Santa Clara.
[00:54:19.120 --> 00:54:21.400]   Sound man, yeah.
[00:54:21.400 --> 00:54:24.120]   You want to hear something really, really scary?
[00:54:24.120 --> 00:54:26.440]   The guys who do MotionX GPS drive,
[00:54:26.440 --> 00:54:29.760]   like my favorite car app for the car navigation app,
[00:54:29.760 --> 00:54:31.600]   they told me that they are officially
[00:54:31.600 --> 00:54:33.680]   working on an iPad version of it, which
[00:54:33.680 --> 00:54:36.360]   could be the sickest, most awesomest thing ever.
[00:54:36.360 --> 00:54:39.200]   I cannot wait to see it.
[00:54:39.200 --> 00:54:44.280]   A number of really great app upgrades, like IMDB, which
[00:54:44.280 --> 00:54:45.600]   is really done a nice job.
[00:54:45.600 --> 00:54:50.040]   It's now become my go-to movie application, just instantly.
[00:54:51.040 --> 00:54:52.840]   Evernote immediately updated.
[00:54:52.840 --> 00:54:55.360]   And I love seeing these companies update for free
[00:54:55.360 --> 00:54:56.560]   in new universal apps.
[00:54:56.560 --> 00:54:58.720]   It's one of the things that's really kind of griping me
[00:54:58.720 --> 00:55:02.680]   is the number of companies, including Apple's own file maker,
[00:55:02.680 --> 00:55:06.160]   that are charging-- they're back again,
[00:55:06.160 --> 00:55:09.080]   charging a full amount for an iPad version of the application.
[00:55:09.080 --> 00:55:13.680]   Admittedly, $5 or $10 isn't a lot for an application,
[00:55:13.680 --> 00:55:15.160]   but it just seems like I already bought
[00:55:15.160 --> 00:55:19.360]   Bento for the desktop, bought Bento for the iPhone.
[00:55:19.360 --> 00:55:22.960]   And really, you want me to buy Bento again for the iPad?
[00:55:22.960 --> 00:55:25.760]   Well, I've got a bone to pick with you on that one.
[00:55:25.760 --> 00:55:26.160]   OK.
[00:55:26.160 --> 00:55:28.360]   Last time I was on, you and Alex were on and on
[00:55:28.360 --> 00:55:30.080]   about plants versus zombies.
[00:55:30.080 --> 00:55:30.760]   So I'm--
[00:55:30.760 --> 00:55:32.160]   Same thing, we got to buy it again.
[00:55:32.160 --> 00:55:34.360]   So I got it, and my daughter's addicted to it.
[00:55:34.360 --> 00:55:37.960]   The first thing, when she gets the iPad, she says,
[00:55:37.960 --> 00:55:39.360]   where's plants versus zombies?
[00:55:39.360 --> 00:55:41.560]   I said, well, I'm sure they don't have an iPad.
[00:55:41.560 --> 00:55:42.160]   Oh, they do.
[00:55:42.160 --> 00:55:43.160]   Oh, they do.
[00:55:43.160 --> 00:55:44.160]   That's $10.
[00:55:44.160 --> 00:55:45.160]   $10.
[00:55:45.160 --> 00:55:45.760]   And I got it.
[00:55:45.760 --> 00:55:46.760]   And it's gorgeous.
[00:55:46.760 --> 00:55:47.560]   It's worth it, I guess.
[00:55:47.560 --> 00:55:48.560]   I guess.
[00:55:48.560 --> 00:55:53.840]   But still, I love the companies that do the in-place upgrades.
[00:55:53.840 --> 00:55:56.320]   And we know it's doable because a number of companies
[00:55:56.320 --> 00:55:59.040]   have done this, and they've made them really look great,
[00:55:59.040 --> 00:56:00.360]   and they work nice.
[00:56:00.360 --> 00:56:00.720]   I just--
[00:56:00.720 --> 00:56:02.480]   Well, I think especially if you're
[00:56:02.480 --> 00:56:04.920]   going to charge a premium for the iPad, I feel like--
[00:56:04.920 --> 00:56:06.480]   You've got to give us more.
[00:56:06.480 --> 00:56:08.560]   Well, we're going to pay a premium for the iPad.
[00:56:08.560 --> 00:56:11.880]   I do feel like we ought to get the iPhone version with it.
[00:56:11.880 --> 00:56:14.520]   Even if it's not downloaded at the same time,
[00:56:14.520 --> 00:56:16.160]   a lot of us have both.
[00:56:16.160 --> 00:56:21.360]   I think probably I would venture to say that 60 to 70, maybe
[00:56:21.360 --> 00:56:24.080]   even 90% of the people who bought an iPad already
[00:56:24.080 --> 00:56:26.280]   have an iPhone that have it.
[00:56:26.280 --> 00:56:27.680]   It's somebody did a survey.
[00:56:27.680 --> 00:56:28.680]   And I think--
[00:56:28.680 --> 00:56:30.040]   I mean, who knows if it was accurate,
[00:56:30.040 --> 00:56:32.480]   but somebody did a survey of people coming out
[00:56:32.480 --> 00:56:36.360]   of Apple stores, and it was like 66% at an iPhone or--
[00:56:36.360 --> 00:56:36.960]   A 6-bit write.
[00:56:36.960 --> 00:56:37.480]   A touch.
[00:56:37.480 --> 00:56:38.840]   Yeah, that seems about right.
[00:56:38.840 --> 00:56:40.840]   OK, so Alex, we've got your gripe.
[00:56:40.840 --> 00:56:42.840]   We've got Andy's gripe.
[00:56:42.840 --> 00:56:43.840]   Chris, we got your gripe.
[00:56:43.840 --> 00:56:46.120]   So I think it's John Gruber's--
[00:56:46.120 --> 00:56:48.360]   what's missing on the iPad, John?
[00:56:48.360 --> 00:56:50.880]   What would you like to see fixed?
[00:56:50.880 --> 00:56:53.360]   I think that there--
[00:56:53.360 --> 00:56:56.040]   this isn't really about the iPad overall.
[00:56:56.040 --> 00:56:57.840]   It's about the iWorks suite.
[00:56:57.840 --> 00:56:59.400]   So I don't know if that counts.
[00:56:59.400 --> 00:57:01.280]   But I think that it's a big enough part of--
[00:57:01.280 --> 00:57:01.800]   Oh, yeah.
[00:57:01.800 --> 00:57:02.560]   --about the announcement.
[00:57:02.560 --> 00:57:05.000]   And it gets to Andy's thing about ambitious apps,
[00:57:05.000 --> 00:57:07.840]   because those are the three that are, to me, the most
[00:57:07.840 --> 00:57:09.520]   ambitious.
[00:57:09.520 --> 00:57:11.280]   They're very ambitious apps.
[00:57:11.280 --> 00:57:15.280]   And they definitely-- I mean, every developer I know
[00:57:15.280 --> 00:57:20.080]   is studying them with complete focus,
[00:57:20.080 --> 00:57:21.600]   because they're more or less the example.
[00:57:21.600 --> 00:57:24.880]   This is how you do an ambitious app.
[00:57:24.880 --> 00:57:27.600]   The problem I have with them is nothing
[00:57:27.600 --> 00:57:32.560]   to do with the actual editing itself, which is brilliant.
[00:57:32.560 --> 00:57:37.680]   It's how do you edit the same document on your iPad
[00:57:37.680 --> 00:57:39.680]   that you've got at your Mac?
[00:57:39.680 --> 00:57:44.840]   And the workflow, it seems to me, it's incredibly convoluted.
[00:57:44.840 --> 00:57:49.880]   You can share files when you sync to iTunes with USB,
[00:57:49.880 --> 00:57:52.160]   but you're making copies of them.
[00:57:52.160 --> 00:57:55.520]   And I thought, well, maybe that's what iWork.com is for.
[00:57:55.520 --> 00:57:58.360]   That's why they did the website, iWork.com.
[00:57:58.360 --> 00:58:00.400]   But it's even worse there.
[00:58:00.400 --> 00:58:04.520]   There you send something to-- you share it to iWork.com,
[00:58:04.520 --> 00:58:06.920]   and you're effectively exporting your document.
[00:58:06.920 --> 00:58:10.200]   A copy of it goes to iWork.com.
[00:58:10.200 --> 00:58:12.960]   And it's really intended for sharing with other people,
[00:58:12.960 --> 00:58:16.280]   because every time you do it, it gives you an email form,
[00:58:16.280 --> 00:58:17.480]   and you have to type somebody's email.
[00:58:17.480 --> 00:58:20.800]   You can leave it blank and just hit share,
[00:58:20.800 --> 00:58:22.560]   and it'll only notify you.
[00:58:22.560 --> 00:58:25.600]   Then you get an email with a URL, and then you can switch
[00:58:25.600 --> 00:58:29.160]   from your iPad to your Mac, click the URL, and download it,
[00:58:29.160 --> 00:58:30.440]   and then open it on your Mac.
[00:58:30.440 --> 00:58:32.840]   But now you've got two copies of the document.
[00:58:32.840 --> 00:58:35.280]   You're not editing the same thing.
[00:58:35.280 --> 00:58:38.320]   So if you want to do-- like what I would like to do with this thing
[00:58:38.320 --> 00:58:44.120]   I'm writing in pages is just have it work the way iMap email works.
[00:58:44.120 --> 00:58:48.160]   Have it work the way mobile me contacts and calendars work,
[00:58:48.160 --> 00:58:50.200]   where there's some sort of online--
[00:58:50.200 --> 00:58:53.400]   I hesitate to use the word cloud, but something in the cloud
[00:58:53.400 --> 00:58:58.360]   where it takes care of syncing changes for something
[00:58:58.360 --> 00:59:00.000]   that you want to share.
[00:59:00.000 --> 00:59:02.200]   And there's nothing like that.
[00:59:02.200 --> 00:59:06.120]   Don't we think that really Apple has to do something
[00:59:06.120 --> 00:59:07.880]   that's more like Google Docs?
[00:59:07.880 --> 00:59:10.760]   Right, and that is exactly it.
[00:59:10.760 --> 00:59:14.320]   In addition to the fact that when you use these iWork apps
[00:59:14.320 --> 00:59:18.200]   on the iPad, to me, if you really, really use them,
[00:59:18.200 --> 00:59:21.720]   unless you really plan to do nothing except work on your iPad,
[00:59:21.720 --> 00:59:27.080]   you never plan to use your Mac, which is not going to be the case.
[00:59:27.080 --> 00:59:30.200]   It cries out for an answer to this problem.
[00:59:30.200 --> 00:59:33.760]   And even worse for Apple is that their number one competitor, Google,
[00:59:33.760 --> 00:59:36.240]   has an answer to this problem, Google Documents,
[00:59:36.240 --> 00:59:41.840]   where the definitive location for your documents is in the cloud.
[00:59:41.840 --> 00:59:44.640]   And the software is a client.
[00:59:44.640 --> 00:59:48.480]   It needs to be more like client server rather than--
[00:59:48.480 --> 00:59:50.680]   it's almost-- really, the workflow is almost
[00:59:50.680 --> 00:59:53.200]   like the old floppy nets from the '80s, where you didn't even
[00:59:53.200 --> 00:59:56.040]   have a network in your office, and you would just copy it to a floppy,
[00:59:56.040 --> 00:59:58.960]   give it to your friend, and then he'd have another copy of the file,
[00:59:58.960 --> 01:00:02.080]   and you'd be like, well, what's the date on your version of the file?
[01:00:02.080 --> 01:00:04.040]   I've got Wednesdays.
[01:00:04.040 --> 01:00:04.880]   No, my--
[01:00:04.880 --> 01:00:06.720]   We had a conversation just this morning about that,
[01:00:06.720 --> 01:00:08.920]   where I was like, you know, we got a numbers document that's
[01:00:08.920 --> 01:00:12.040]   keeping track of a bunch of the Pixel Core challenges that we're launching,
[01:00:12.040 --> 01:00:14.080]   and I was like, just get it into Google Docs,
[01:00:14.080 --> 01:00:15.920]   so I can make sure that we're not switching up--
[01:00:15.920 --> 01:00:17.160]   we kept on switching up the versions.
[01:00:17.160 --> 01:00:18.600]   I was like, I don't want to think about this anymore.
[01:00:18.600 --> 01:00:19.520]   And just put it in Google Docs.
[01:00:19.520 --> 01:00:22.800]   You can't do that with the iWork apps.
[01:00:22.800 --> 01:00:24.880]   And I think you absolutely need to.
[01:00:24.880 --> 01:00:27.200]   I mean, otherwise, it's like a tool.
[01:00:27.200 --> 01:00:29.200]   All I was just saying is, I think that there's an opportunity
[01:00:29.200 --> 01:00:31.720]   for something superior, because I don't really like using the web page
[01:00:31.720 --> 01:00:32.960]   to go to Google Docs.
[01:00:32.960 --> 01:00:34.720]   What I want is the--
[01:00:34.720 --> 01:00:38.960]   I want an interface that is network aware, like iTunes.
[01:00:38.960 --> 01:00:42.840]   You know, I don't want to go to Amazon.com to buy music.
[01:00:42.840 --> 01:00:44.280]   I want to go to iTunes to buy music.
[01:00:44.280 --> 01:00:45.640]   In the same way, I don't want to go--
[01:00:45.640 --> 01:00:47.520]   I want to be able to use numbers and pages,
[01:00:47.520 --> 01:00:49.520]   but just have that feeding into a--
[01:00:49.520 --> 01:00:51.360]   I don't want to use the browser with Google Docs.
[01:00:51.360 --> 01:00:55.000]   I mean, I'd use it, and then that's what every new document that we build
[01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:57.000]   is built-- starts in Google Docs.
[01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:59.040]   We get it all the text the way we want it,
[01:00:59.040 --> 01:01:00.800]   and then we bring it into pages.
[01:01:00.800 --> 01:01:02.280]   You know, and it's--
[01:01:02.280 --> 01:01:08.680]   I'm using a third-party app called Office Squared Pro
[01:01:08.680 --> 01:01:13.440]   that lets me hook up to Mobile Me and My Eye Disc and to Google Docs.
[01:01:13.440 --> 01:01:17.760]   And I'm able to open files from either one of those.
[01:01:17.760 --> 01:01:20.040]   And it also works with a web dev server.
[01:01:20.040 --> 01:01:22.320]   But you open it up from within there, and you can view it.
[01:01:22.320 --> 01:01:24.000]   You can edit Google Docs directly in there.
[01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:26.600]   I mean, it's a pretty decent interface to it.
[01:01:26.600 --> 01:01:28.000]   So that's a third-party solution.
[01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:29.560]   I'm not saying that it's easy.
[01:01:29.560 --> 01:01:30.840]   Apple should make it easier, though.
[01:01:30.840 --> 01:01:31.320]   I agree with it.
[01:01:31.320 --> 01:01:31.960]   Right.
[01:01:31.960 --> 01:01:33.480]   I'm not saying it's an easy problem,
[01:01:33.480 --> 01:01:35.240]   but there are companies that have solved it.
[01:01:35.240 --> 01:01:37.400]   So I mean, everybody I know with an iPhone
[01:01:37.400 --> 01:01:39.320]   uses one of the apps that's like--
[01:01:39.320 --> 01:01:40.840]   I use SimpleNote.
[01:01:40.840 --> 01:01:43.360]   I know a lot of people use Evernote.
[01:01:43.360 --> 01:01:45.000]   But they all-- and they have different interfaces
[01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:45.800]   and they're different styles.
[01:01:45.800 --> 01:01:47.240]   But they fundamentally do the same thing,
[01:01:47.240 --> 01:01:50.040]   where you can have these just plain text snippets
[01:01:50.040 --> 01:01:53.280]   where you create one on your iPhone,
[01:01:53.280 --> 01:01:56.320]   and then the next time you're sitting at your Mac, there it is.
[01:01:56.320 --> 01:01:59.200]   And if you add a couple of items to it on your Mac,
[01:01:59.200 --> 01:02:01.240]   the next time you look at it on your iPhone,
[01:02:01.240 --> 01:02:02.920]   there those changes are.
[01:02:02.920 --> 01:02:07.720]   And you don't have to worry about copies of files.
[01:02:07.720 --> 01:02:09.800]   It just sinks.
[01:02:09.800 --> 01:02:13.720]   And Apple has done this with contacts and calendars
[01:02:13.720 --> 01:02:14.760]   with Mobile Me.
[01:02:14.760 --> 01:02:16.320]   But they haven't done anything else,
[01:02:16.320 --> 01:02:18.240]   and it really sticks out like a sore thumb
[01:02:18.240 --> 01:02:19.880]   when you use these iWork apps.
[01:02:19.880 --> 01:02:21.440]   Yeah.
[01:02:21.440 --> 01:02:23.440]   Yeah, it could be really elegant.
[01:02:23.440 --> 01:02:25.840]   One other gripe is that I don't think
[01:02:25.840 --> 01:02:29.200]   that the resolution on the iPad is high enough.
[01:02:29.200 --> 01:02:34.200]   If you-- the Pixel's Prince comes out to 132 or 133,
[01:02:34.200 --> 01:02:39.520]   and the iPhone is 163 or 162.
[01:02:39.520 --> 01:02:44.840]   I think that especially when you're reading the books,
[01:02:44.840 --> 01:02:48.160]   it's-- I mean, maybe I'm just a picky person with typography.
[01:02:48.160 --> 01:02:51.680]   But to me, they look a little bit too smudgy.
[01:02:51.680 --> 01:02:54.760]   I would love to see a next generation model a year
[01:02:54.760 --> 01:02:58.480]   from now or two years from now with the same size screen,
[01:02:58.480 --> 01:03:01.120]   same physical size, but more Pixel's Prince.
[01:03:01.120 --> 01:03:01.640]   Right.
[01:03:01.640 --> 01:03:03.200]   I think you'd agree with that too, Alex.
[01:03:03.200 --> 01:03:05.480]   Not for video, but just for text.
[01:03:05.480 --> 01:03:08.480]   But even for HD video, I mean, it's 1024 by 768,
[01:03:08.480 --> 01:03:12.120]   so it's not wide enough to do 720p.
[01:03:12.120 --> 01:03:13.240]   I think that that was a cost.
[01:03:13.240 --> 01:03:14.480]   I definitely--
[01:03:14.480 --> 01:03:16.120]   Oh, yeah, that's absolutely a cost thing.
[01:03:16.120 --> 01:03:17.320]   I mean, that's the one thing too.
[01:03:17.320 --> 01:03:22.400]   I mean, that's absolutely one of the--
[01:03:22.400 --> 01:03:25.960]   the starting point of this whole thing was definitely--
[01:03:25.960 --> 01:03:28.120]   let's try to sell this thing for like 500 bucks.
[01:03:28.120 --> 01:03:30.280]   And so, of course, they had to make compromises.
[01:03:30.280 --> 01:03:33.440]   And everybody knows that Apple makes high quality products,
[01:03:33.440 --> 01:03:37.880]   but they're carving out this weird--
[01:03:37.880 --> 01:03:39.640]   they're not premium priced anymore.
[01:03:39.640 --> 01:03:44.160]   They're consumer priced, but very, very high quality.
[01:03:44.160 --> 01:03:45.840]   I mean, the thing feels great.
[01:03:45.840 --> 01:03:48.240]   I mean, it has this-- the glass feels great.
[01:03:48.240 --> 01:03:49.520]   The aluminum feels great.
[01:03:49.520 --> 01:03:52.400]   The seams along where the glass meets the aluminum
[01:03:52.400 --> 01:03:53.160]   are just perfect.
[01:03:53.160 --> 01:03:57.880]   The buttons click with just a wonderful tactile feel.
[01:03:57.880 --> 01:04:00.280]   But in other ways, they absolutely
[01:04:00.280 --> 01:04:02.400]   made decisions that were all about cost.
[01:04:02.400 --> 01:04:07.200]   The fact that it only has 256 megabytes of RAM cost.
[01:04:07.200 --> 01:04:09.400]   That's a cost issue.
[01:04:09.400 --> 01:04:13.040]   No headphones, no polishing cloth, and nothing gets smudgy,
[01:04:13.040 --> 01:04:14.920]   so you could certainly use one.
[01:04:14.920 --> 01:04:16.320]   And no calculator.
[01:04:16.320 --> 01:04:19.040]   Where is the calculator?
[01:04:19.040 --> 01:04:21.280]   Well, you don't want to calculate what kind of compromises
[01:04:21.280 --> 01:04:23.360]   they make, so they don't want to make it easy for you to do.
[01:04:23.360 --> 01:04:24.760]   My phone.
[01:04:24.760 --> 01:04:26.520]   They did leave up a number of applications
[01:04:26.520 --> 01:04:27.360]   that come with the iPhone.
[01:04:27.360 --> 01:04:30.920]   I'm not sure why they-- I guess they just ran out of time.
[01:04:30.920 --> 01:04:33.040]   I have to think that those applications are really good
[01:04:33.040 --> 01:04:35.240]   for a small form device, rather than--
[01:04:35.240 --> 01:04:37.640]   I mean, some people said, well, they're third parties that
[01:04:37.640 --> 01:04:38.560]   offer these sort of things.
[01:04:38.560 --> 01:04:39.120]   So--
[01:04:39.120 --> 01:04:39.880]   Yeah, I bought P-Cal.
[01:04:39.880 --> 01:04:40.840]   --the third party option.
[01:04:40.840 --> 01:04:43.880]   But if I want to check my stocks,
[01:04:43.880 --> 01:04:46.720]   my iPhone is perfect for that, or my iPod touch is perfect,
[01:04:46.720 --> 01:04:49.520]   because I don't want a big screen of that kind of information.
[01:04:49.520 --> 01:04:50.840]   I'm not a weather piece.
[01:04:50.840 --> 01:04:51.680]   That kind of stuff too.
[01:04:51.680 --> 01:04:52.920]   Bloomberg is a pretty nice one.
[01:04:52.920 --> 01:04:55.760]   It updated for the iPhone, and they really did a nice job of--
[01:04:55.760 --> 01:04:58.600]   I'm waiting for the app DayTrader.
[01:04:58.600 --> 01:04:59.760]   Yeah, I'm trying to add a quote.
[01:04:59.760 --> 01:05:01.480]   You probably do that, couldn't you?
[01:05:01.480 --> 01:05:03.480]   I mean, I just think they've done a really nice job
[01:05:03.480 --> 01:05:05.560]   of using their real estate on the Bloomberg app.
[01:05:05.560 --> 01:05:06.040]   But you're right.
[01:05:06.040 --> 01:05:10.600]   I mean, Apple's stock app was kind of a joke all along anyway.
[01:05:10.600 --> 01:05:13.720]   My gripe, I think, is about email.
[01:05:13.720 --> 01:05:14.680]   It's so close.
[01:05:14.680 --> 01:05:20.080]   I really like it, except that it's just--
[01:05:20.080 --> 01:05:22.440]   I need a unified inbox.
[01:05:22.440 --> 01:05:23.880]   I have three different accounts, and I've
[01:05:23.880 --> 01:05:26.240]   got to go back, back, back, back, back, back, back, back, back,
[01:05:26.240 --> 01:05:28.360]   to check mail in the different accounts.
[01:05:28.360 --> 01:05:31.080]   It seems like such a simple thing that they could have fixed.
[01:05:31.080 --> 01:05:32.640]   I do like the reader app.
[01:05:32.640 --> 01:05:35.720]   I don't have your problem with it, John.
[01:05:35.720 --> 01:05:38.360]   Just for the show, I downloaded it
[01:05:38.360 --> 01:05:41.280]   and read for a couple of hours last night.
[01:05:41.280 --> 01:05:44.880]   It is a little weird to read a glowing box.
[01:05:44.880 --> 01:05:47.000]   I mean, it's a little disconcerting initially.
[01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:49.200]   But it doesn't seem particularly hard on the eyes,
[01:05:49.200 --> 01:05:51.880]   especially if you turn the brightness down.
[01:05:51.880 --> 01:05:55.040]   I have to say, I'm probably going to end up using the Kindle app.
[01:05:55.040 --> 01:05:57.120]   Kudos to Amazon and Apple.
[01:05:57.120 --> 01:05:59.040]   Kudos to Amazon for updating it for the iPad
[01:05:59.040 --> 01:06:00.920]   and making it pretty usable.
[01:06:00.920 --> 01:06:03.400]   And to Apple for not blocking it.
[01:06:03.400 --> 01:06:06.760]   Because frankly, the Kindle store is a better store still
[01:06:06.760 --> 01:06:08.160]   than the iBook store.
[01:06:08.160 --> 01:06:09.400]   And I have a lot of Kindle books.
[01:06:09.400 --> 01:06:11.720]   I mean, they can read them.
[01:06:11.720 --> 01:06:15.280]   Yeah, Apple says that at launch they had 60,000 books
[01:06:15.280 --> 01:06:16.400]   in the iBook store.
[01:06:16.400 --> 01:06:17.960]   And then, of course, I have to ask the follow-up question.
[01:06:17.960 --> 01:06:19.320]   Well, how many of those are Gutenberg?
[01:06:19.320 --> 01:06:21.200]   And they said that'd be 30,000 of those.
[01:06:21.200 --> 01:06:22.240]   Yeah, half of them.
[01:06:22.240 --> 01:06:23.640]   And of course, yeah.
[01:06:23.640 --> 01:06:25.960]   And then, of course, I get in touch with Amazon.
[01:06:25.960 --> 01:06:27.320]   And they're more than happy to tell me
[01:06:27.320 --> 01:06:30.240]   that they have nearly half a million independent titles.
[01:06:30.240 --> 01:06:34.480]   But I really think between iBooks and the Kindle,
[01:06:34.480 --> 01:06:36.880]   the two devices are-- it's a push.
[01:06:36.880 --> 01:06:38.360]   It's definitely more pleasant to read something
[01:06:38.360 --> 01:06:39.400]   with the higher resolution.
[01:06:39.400 --> 01:06:41.080]   It's definitely more pleasant to read something
[01:06:41.080 --> 01:06:42.720]   with such higher contrast.
[01:06:42.720 --> 01:06:46.880]   The glossy screen is also a problem in many situations.
[01:06:46.880 --> 01:06:50.000]   If you're indoors like this, even with a bright window
[01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:51.840]   on the side here, it's not a problem.
[01:06:51.840 --> 01:06:53.680]   There might be one or two angles in which you can't really
[01:06:53.680 --> 01:06:54.360]   see the screen.
[01:06:54.360 --> 01:06:57.600]   But if you're sitting on a train and you've got the window
[01:06:57.600 --> 01:06:58.760]   seat, you can't really tell--
[01:06:58.760 --> 01:07:00.400]   Dr. K, please have the train swerve
[01:07:00.400 --> 01:07:01.840]   about 20 degrees to the left.
[01:07:01.840 --> 01:07:03.840]   It's still right.
[01:07:03.840 --> 01:07:05.720]   But it makes up for it by the fact
[01:07:05.720 --> 01:07:08.360]   that how many times have I been using my Kindle
[01:07:08.360 --> 01:07:12.680]   and I have to turn on a light or get a look light or--
[01:07:12.680 --> 01:07:14.400]   it's a red-eye flight on the plane.
[01:07:14.400 --> 01:07:16.720]   I have to turn on the big blast furnace halogen
[01:07:16.720 --> 01:07:18.640]   light on top just because I want to read a book.
[01:07:18.640 --> 01:07:20.440]   The back lighting, I think, compensates.
[01:07:20.440 --> 01:07:22.360]   They're about the same readability,
[01:07:22.360 --> 01:07:23.520]   but in different situations.
[01:07:23.520 --> 01:07:24.880]   I read in bed a lot.
[01:07:24.880 --> 01:07:26.480]   So this is a great thing for me.
[01:07:26.480 --> 01:07:28.560]   I don't have to turn on a light and wake my wife up.
[01:07:28.560 --> 01:07:29.200]   I can read in bed.
[01:07:29.200 --> 01:07:30.920]   It's just a little bit of a glow.
[01:07:30.920 --> 01:07:34.280]   And by the way, in the dark, you do turn almost all the way
[01:07:34.280 --> 01:07:34.960]   down.
[01:07:34.960 --> 01:07:36.680]   You don't need a lot of light.
[01:07:36.680 --> 01:07:42.880]   And I think that the exciting thing about what the iPad presents
[01:07:42.880 --> 01:07:46.320]   is where books are going to go, not so much where they are now.
[01:07:46.320 --> 01:07:49.640]   Reading them, yeah, we can talk about whether they read well
[01:07:49.640 --> 01:07:49.960]   or not.
[01:07:49.960 --> 01:07:53.840]   But I think that elements in some of those types of books
[01:07:53.840 --> 01:07:58.000]   and what we're seeing in bits of some of the magazine tests,
[01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:03.160]   we're going to leave the idea of static text pretty quickly,
[01:08:03.160 --> 01:08:03.880]   I think.
[01:08:03.880 --> 01:08:05.480]   I think for the next generation, I think it's a lot of them.
[01:08:05.480 --> 01:08:07.440]   Well, even just having colors is pretty nice.
[01:08:07.440 --> 01:08:10.440]   I was surprised I have a objective seat programming book
[01:08:10.440 --> 01:08:12.600]   that I wanted to get on all the platforms.
[01:08:12.600 --> 01:08:13.920]   It's not available in the iBook Store,
[01:08:13.920 --> 01:08:15.120]   so I couldn't really compare it.
[01:08:15.120 --> 01:08:16.840]   But I did have it on the Kindle.
[01:08:16.840 --> 01:08:19.520]   And it turns out the figures are in color,
[01:08:19.520 --> 01:08:20.560]   the screenshots are in color.
[01:08:20.560 --> 01:08:22.640]   I would never have known.
[01:08:22.640 --> 01:08:25.080]   It's not in color in the print book, which I also have.
[01:08:25.080 --> 01:08:28.040]   It's not in color on the Kindle, but it is in color on the iPad.
[01:08:28.040 --> 01:08:28.880]   That's kind of nice.
[01:08:28.880 --> 01:08:30.520]   I like that.
[01:08:30.520 --> 01:08:33.520]   But I don't know if I need animation.
[01:08:33.520 --> 01:08:36.840]   What I'd really like, a little window where I could type in
[01:08:36.840 --> 01:08:38.840]   Objective-C code as I'm reading the book.
[01:08:38.840 --> 01:08:42.320]   But that's, you know, I have to say I'm motivated.
[01:08:42.320 --> 01:08:43.520]   You need to modify the books behavior.
[01:08:43.520 --> 01:08:46.760]   Yeah, I have to say I am very motivated.
[01:08:46.760 --> 01:08:48.720]   I know Alex, you're going to be going to Big Nerd Ranch
[01:08:48.720 --> 01:08:49.480]   at some point soon.
[01:08:49.480 --> 01:08:50.680]   I don't know if we're going to be able to do a Twitter
[01:08:50.680 --> 01:08:52.760]   event there because I think we're kind of busy in the month
[01:08:52.760 --> 01:08:55.320]   of June, but I'm definitely going to go because this,
[01:08:55.320 --> 01:08:58.240]   you want to write software for this, don't you, this iPad?
[01:08:58.240 --> 01:08:59.920]   Yeah, you really think--
[01:08:59.920 --> 01:09:00.520]   Absolutely.
[01:09:00.520 --> 01:09:01.520]   --it gets the mic going.
[01:09:01.520 --> 01:09:03.120]   Like what could I do with this, you know?
[01:09:03.120 --> 01:09:07.320]   Yeah, I'm so excited to take the Big Nerd class and really dig
[01:09:07.320 --> 01:09:07.600]   into that.
[01:09:07.600 --> 01:09:08.520]   I've been talking to the guys there.
[01:09:08.520 --> 01:09:11.000]   And I just-- you want to play with it.
[01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:12.720]   Even if it's not something I'm going to sell, I just want to
[01:09:12.720 --> 01:09:14.840]   have little apps that I can kind of play with and build and
[01:09:14.840 --> 01:09:17.840]   put them on and crazy ideas that I have.
[01:09:17.840 --> 01:09:20.680]   It's just a great palette to play with.
[01:09:20.680 --> 01:09:22.080]   What about the complaint some people had?
[01:09:22.080 --> 01:09:23.680]   Then we're going to move on to iPhone 4.0.
[01:09:23.680 --> 01:09:25.640]   But what about the complaint some people had that no
[01:09:25.640 --> 01:09:28.960]   platform's really succeeded if you couldn't develop directly
[01:09:28.960 --> 01:09:29.920]   on that platform?
[01:09:29.920 --> 01:09:31.480]   Is that the case?
[01:09:31.480 --> 01:09:32.000]   Yeah.
[01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:33.640]   Because the iPhone hasn't worked well at all.
[01:09:33.640 --> 01:09:34.160]   Oh, yeah.
[01:09:34.160 --> 01:09:34.840]   It's going to work for failure.
[01:09:34.840 --> 01:09:35.440]   I don't know.
[01:09:35.440 --> 01:09:36.040]   Oh, yeah.
[01:09:36.040 --> 01:09:37.600]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:09:37.600 --> 01:09:42.440]   You know, even the Macintosh in 1984, you couldn't write
[01:09:42.440 --> 01:09:43.520]   programs on the Macintosh.
[01:09:43.520 --> 01:09:44.600]   You had to have a Lisa.
[01:09:44.600 --> 01:09:47.640]   And a Lisa was like, I don't know, $14,000, something like
[01:09:47.640 --> 01:09:48.000]   that.
[01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:51.480]   I forget when the first version of MPW came out.
[01:09:51.480 --> 01:09:54.080]   But I don't think it was until like 1986.
[01:09:54.080 --> 01:09:54.720]   That's right, John.
[01:09:54.720 --> 01:09:55.200]   You're right.
[01:09:55.200 --> 01:09:56.200]   Yeah.
[01:09:56.200 --> 01:09:56.720]   I do think--
[01:09:56.720 --> 01:09:58.560]   The Mac did all right.
[01:09:58.560 --> 01:10:00.200]   I do think Apple has a lot to do--
[01:10:00.200 --> 01:10:02.480]   has a lot to work to do with this store.
[01:10:02.480 --> 01:10:05.480]   It looks like they're finally starting to separate the iPad
[01:10:05.480 --> 01:10:07.960]   and the iPhone stuff for a while.
[01:10:07.960 --> 01:10:08.760]   There was a little switch.
[01:10:08.760 --> 01:10:10.400]   And they've already kind of gotten to even get two different
[01:10:10.400 --> 01:10:10.920]   worlds.
[01:10:10.920 --> 01:10:12.920]   Because when you start searching from an iPad perspective,
[01:10:12.920 --> 01:10:15.800]   I don't really care what's on the iPhone that's available.
[01:10:15.800 --> 01:10:18.200]   I think a lot of developers are a little frustrated because
[01:10:18.200 --> 01:10:20.960]   they're still getting it organized.
[01:10:20.960 --> 01:10:24.400]   And so a lot of them have been kind of buried underneath.
[01:10:24.400 --> 01:10:26.160]   It's just very hard to get to the surface.
[01:10:26.160 --> 01:10:28.920]   Everyone kind of rushed in very quickly.
[01:10:28.920 --> 01:10:30.840]   And so I think there is that typical--
[01:10:30.840 --> 01:10:31.880]   I mean, the same frustration we've
[01:10:31.880 --> 01:10:35.240]   seen in other parts of the App Store
[01:10:35.240 --> 01:10:36.760]   is that it's very hard to--
[01:10:36.760 --> 01:10:37.600]   you don't explore.
[01:10:37.600 --> 01:10:39.760]   I think that that's the big thing right now with the App Store
[01:10:39.760 --> 01:10:41.160]   is you don't explore in the App Store.
[01:10:41.160 --> 01:10:42.840]   You can find out about it on the web.
[01:10:42.840 --> 01:10:44.480]   And then there's a direct link to the App Store.
[01:10:44.480 --> 01:10:45.600]   But you don't--
[01:10:45.600 --> 01:10:47.640]   it's very hard to kind of wander around through the App Store
[01:10:47.640 --> 01:10:48.680]   to find something new.
[01:10:48.680 --> 01:10:49.320]   Other than the top 100--
[01:10:49.320 --> 01:10:51.000]   Same thing with the iTunes store here.
[01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:51.840]   Yeah.
[01:10:51.840 --> 01:10:52.960]   It's true.
[01:10:52.960 --> 01:10:55.440]   Because I know that because I've been spending every five
[01:10:55.440 --> 01:10:58.000]   minutes in the App Store looking for updated apps.
[01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:01.200]   You know, even like an issue, a Sky Mall
[01:11:01.200 --> 01:11:04.600]   is a better browsing interface than the App Store.
[01:11:04.600 --> 01:11:05.120]   I don't know.
[01:11:05.120 --> 01:11:07.040]   It really is not a good browsing interface.
[01:11:07.040 --> 01:11:07.800]   No.
[01:11:07.800 --> 01:11:08.240]   Yeah.
[01:11:08.240 --> 01:11:09.520]   That's really focused on charts.
[01:11:09.520 --> 01:11:10.840]   I think that that's the iTunes--
[01:11:10.840 --> 01:11:12.040]   Charts and search.
[01:11:12.040 --> 01:11:12.840]   Charts and search.
[01:11:12.840 --> 01:11:14.280]   And that's really a function of the fact
[01:11:14.280 --> 01:11:16.360]   that it's an iTunes derivative.
[01:11:16.360 --> 01:11:20.000]   That's how music works.
[01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:21.440]   All right, we're going to take another break.
[01:11:21.440 --> 01:11:22.080]   Come back.
[01:11:22.080 --> 01:11:26.200]   We've got to talk about what you might expect from iPhone 4.0.
[01:11:26.200 --> 01:11:26.880]   I can't believe it.
[01:11:26.880 --> 01:11:29.520]   Finally, the focus has moved off iPad
[01:11:29.520 --> 01:11:31.320]   and onto another platform.
[01:11:31.320 --> 01:11:36.040]   And even some rumors, there might be a new MacBook Pro
[01:11:36.040 --> 01:11:37.600]   refresh in the works.
[01:11:37.600 --> 01:11:39.320]   We'll talk about that too in just a little bit
[01:11:39.320 --> 01:11:40.000]   before we do, though.
[01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:42.920]   I want to remind everybody if it's time to make a website,
[01:11:42.920 --> 01:11:46.240]   it's time to visit squarespace.com.
[01:11:46.240 --> 01:11:49.560]   Squarespace is the place to make beautiful websites.
[01:11:49.560 --> 01:11:52.360]   It's web hosting as well as software.
[01:11:52.360 --> 01:11:54.480]   So you get kind of the best of both worlds
[01:11:54.480 --> 01:11:56.520]   as little as $8 a month.
[01:11:56.520 --> 01:11:59.760]   You can make gorgeous sites, sites
[01:11:59.760 --> 01:12:02.600]   that don't look like they're all cookie-cuttered out, either,
[01:12:02.600 --> 01:12:03.360]   which I really like.
[01:12:03.360 --> 01:12:08.600]   It's where squarespace starts with templates.
[01:12:08.600 --> 01:12:10.360]   I think they have a dozen really, something like that,
[01:12:10.360 --> 01:12:11.600]   really gorgeous templates.
[01:12:11.600 --> 01:12:13.920]   But you can immediately make them your own.
[01:12:13.920 --> 01:12:17.560]   And if you want an example, go to squarespace.com/macbreak
[01:12:17.560 --> 01:12:22.080]   and take a look at the example sites.
[01:12:22.080 --> 01:12:24.720]   They've got blogs, portfolios, businesses.
[01:12:24.720 --> 01:12:27.640]   And each one is unique, one of a kind, gorgeous.
[01:12:27.640 --> 01:12:30.720]   And you never look at it and say, as you would sometimes,
[01:12:30.720 --> 01:12:34.600]   a Drupal or WordPress, oh, I know what the content management
[01:12:34.600 --> 01:12:35.320]   system is there.
[01:12:35.320 --> 01:12:37.800]   They're all unique and gorgeous.
[01:12:37.800 --> 01:12:41.160]   A lot of photographers use it because of their great photography
[01:12:41.160 --> 01:12:42.720]   capabilities.
[01:12:42.720 --> 01:12:47.000]   A lot of businesses are using squarespace.com.
[01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:50.400]   Even bloggers, it's not just a blogging platform,
[01:12:50.400 --> 01:12:52.440]   but what a great blogging platform.
[01:12:52.440 --> 01:12:53.600]   I'll make you a deal.
[01:12:53.600 --> 01:12:55.600]   If you go to squarespace.com/macbreak,
[01:12:55.600 --> 01:12:58.960]   you can try this free, import all of your blog contents
[01:12:58.960 --> 01:12:59.800]   and export it to.
[01:12:59.800 --> 01:13:02.760]   You're never tied to a squarespace site.
[01:13:02.760 --> 01:13:05.080]   They've got import and export tools
[01:13:05.080 --> 01:13:09.360]   for all the major blogging platforms, WordPress,
[01:13:09.360 --> 01:13:12.480]   a movable type, type pad, and blogger.
[01:13:12.480 --> 01:13:14.360]   Seamlessly, import and export.
[01:13:14.360 --> 01:13:15.720]   Give it a try for two weeks.
[01:13:15.720 --> 01:13:16.640]   No credit card needed.
[01:13:16.640 --> 01:13:17.680]   I mean, it's absolutely free.
[01:13:17.680 --> 01:13:18.920]   You can see what it can do for you.
[01:13:18.920 --> 01:13:22.120]   Play with the site templating.
[01:13:22.120 --> 01:13:23.000]   Play with the editing.
[01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:27.080]   A great iPhone app.
[01:13:27.080 --> 01:13:28.840]   I'm sure they're going to be updating that for the iPad.
[01:13:28.840 --> 01:13:32.520]   That'll make it the ultimate blogging platform for the iPad.
[01:13:32.520 --> 01:13:33.560]   Really just gorgeous.
[01:13:33.560 --> 01:13:36.760]   Try it free for two weeks, squarespace.com/macbreak.
[01:13:36.760 --> 01:13:38.920]   And if you decide you want to set up a squarespace site,
[01:13:38.920 --> 01:13:41.160]   again, as little as $8 a month, that includes hosting
[01:13:41.160 --> 01:13:44.680]   and all the software and the stats and everything, the iPhone
[01:13:44.680 --> 01:13:45.880]   app.
[01:13:45.880 --> 01:13:47.680]   If you use the coupon code MACbreak,
[01:13:47.680 --> 01:13:50.840]   you'll get 10% off for life.
[01:13:50.840 --> 01:13:53.560]   For life, that could add up to quite a bit.
[01:13:53.560 --> 01:13:56.040]   squarespace.com/macbreak.
[01:13:56.040 --> 01:13:57.360]   We love these guys.
[01:13:57.360 --> 01:13:58.840]   They really care about their customers.
[01:13:58.840 --> 01:14:00.880]   They do a great job.
[01:14:00.880 --> 01:14:05.080]   Dane and Anthony and the gang, Daven.
[01:14:05.080 --> 01:14:07.240]   And they've got a great platform.
[01:14:07.240 --> 01:14:10.560]   squarespace.com/macbreak.
[01:14:10.560 --> 01:14:16.400]   Thank them so much for their support of Macbreak weekly.
[01:14:16.400 --> 01:14:19.440]   So iPhone 4.0 Thursday.
[01:14:19.440 --> 01:14:20.880]   Andy, you got an invitation, but I
[01:14:20.880 --> 01:14:21.960]   think you're stuck in Colorado.
[01:14:21.960 --> 01:14:25.520]   Are you not going to come out to Cupertino for that, are you?
[01:14:25.520 --> 01:14:26.320]   Unfortunately, no.
[01:14:26.320 --> 01:14:28.280]   I'm here in the great state of Colorado,
[01:14:28.280 --> 01:14:31.120]   the mile high city of Boulder outside
[01:14:31.120 --> 01:14:32.800]   of the other mile high city of Denver.
[01:14:32.800 --> 01:14:35.040]   I'll be honest, just because I wasn't invited--
[01:14:35.040 --> 01:14:37.200]   I'm not saying this just because I wasn't invited.
[01:14:37.200 --> 01:14:37.680]   I'm not.
[01:14:37.680 --> 01:14:39.040]   I'm really not.
[01:14:39.040 --> 01:14:42.440]   I don't think I'd go anyway.
[01:14:42.440 --> 01:14:42.840]   Oh, wait a minute.
[01:14:42.840 --> 01:14:43.680]   I got an invitation.
[01:14:43.680 --> 01:14:44.440]   I think I'll be going.
[01:14:44.440 --> 01:14:46.200]   No, no.
[01:14:46.200 --> 01:14:49.240]   I'll say I'll say it would be a tough one for me, only because I
[01:14:49.240 --> 01:14:51.000]   feel as though it's going to be iPhone 4.0.
[01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:52.760]   I know it's going to be something I'm going to want to cover
[01:14:52.760 --> 01:14:53.760]   and write about.
[01:14:53.760 --> 01:14:57.560]   I'm not convinced at this stage that I'd get a hands-on experience.
[01:14:57.560 --> 01:14:59.160]   And somebody going by you with a squeaky
[01:14:59.160 --> 01:15:00.440]   parameter right now?
[01:15:00.440 --> 01:15:01.280]   Yeah.
[01:15:01.280 --> 01:15:02.400]   We got a dog.
[01:15:02.400 --> 01:15:04.480]   We just discovered that if you bite into it,
[01:15:04.480 --> 01:15:06.480]   this orange ball, it makes nice noises.
[01:15:06.480 --> 01:15:07.400]   Oh, dear.
[01:15:07.400 --> 01:15:08.200]   Oh, dear.
[01:15:08.200 --> 01:15:08.680]   Oh, dear.
[01:15:08.680 --> 01:15:11.800]   I thought it was the ice cream truck.
[01:15:11.800 --> 01:15:14.040]   Hey, for the ice cream truck, you wouldn't see me in the frame.
[01:15:14.040 --> 01:15:16.880]   Well, it's interesting that they said iPhone 4.0.
[01:15:16.880 --> 01:15:19.880]   It sounds like it's a software announcement, not a hardware
[01:15:19.880 --> 01:15:20.400]   announcement.
[01:15:20.400 --> 01:15:21.280]   Is that--
[01:15:21.280 --> 01:15:22.040]   Oh, yeah.
[01:15:22.040 --> 01:15:22.560]   Definitely.
[01:15:22.560 --> 01:15:24.680]   It's the same schedule as the last two years.
[01:15:24.680 --> 01:15:28.640]   So they don't announce the hardware till right before June?
[01:15:28.640 --> 01:15:33.240]   I would guess at WWDC, but they haven't announced WWDC dates yet.
[01:15:33.240 --> 01:15:35.680]   So who knows?
[01:15:35.680 --> 01:15:37.440]   So this is-- I mean, it's--
[01:15:37.440 --> 01:15:39.840]   they're doing it at the town hall in Co-Portino.
[01:15:39.840 --> 01:15:41.720]   They're not-- which is not a big venue.
[01:15:41.720 --> 01:15:44.200]   What could we possibly expect for iPhone 4.0?
[01:15:44.200 --> 01:15:45.000]   Somebody asked me that.
[01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:48.440]   I was trying to think there's a little-- there's a few UI tweaks,
[01:15:48.440 --> 01:15:49.080]   maybe.
[01:15:49.080 --> 01:15:52.160]   But do you think-- you said multitasking, John?
[01:15:52.160 --> 01:15:53.120]   Yeah, in some form.
[01:15:53.120 --> 01:15:57.520]   I'm not quite sure everything.
[01:15:57.520 --> 01:15:59.480]   I'm not quite sure about the details.
[01:15:59.480 --> 01:16:03.320]   I do know-- I would-- well, I don't-- I wouldn't say I know,
[01:16:03.320 --> 01:16:08.520]   but I kind of know that I think audio apps are going to be--
[01:16:08.520 --> 01:16:10.360]   third party audio apps are going to probably
[01:16:10.360 --> 01:16:13.800]   be pretty happy with iPhone OS 4.0.
[01:16:13.800 --> 01:16:16.480]   I would love to have Pandora have parity with the iPod,
[01:16:16.480 --> 01:16:17.800]   so I could listen to my Pandora music.
[01:16:17.800 --> 01:16:18.560]   You're absolutely right.
[01:16:18.560 --> 01:16:21.440]   Or a last defam or slacker.
[01:16:21.440 --> 01:16:22.560]   And I think that'll be a big one.
[01:16:22.560 --> 01:16:27.440]   I wonder-- but I think then that also means, though, that--
[01:16:27.440 --> 01:16:29.160]   and this is just speculation on my part--
[01:16:29.160 --> 01:16:31.760]   that if they're going to do anything with multitasking,
[01:16:31.760 --> 01:16:33.360]   then I think that it's got to be time
[01:16:33.360 --> 01:16:36.400]   that they take a look at the whole home screen UI,
[01:16:36.400 --> 01:16:39.480]   springboard, whatever you want to call it, that--
[01:16:39.480 --> 01:16:41.440]   I mean, everybody is starting to get frustrated with it.
[01:16:41.440 --> 01:16:45.560]   And Apple's marketing, even just to typical consumers,
[01:16:45.560 --> 01:16:49.280]   is about the number of apps in the App Store.
[01:16:49.280 --> 01:16:52.920]   So I think there-- it's not just power users or nerds,
[01:16:52.920 --> 01:16:53.720]   people like us.
[01:16:53.720 --> 01:16:55.520]   I think even typical people are starting
[01:16:55.520 --> 01:16:59.000]   to run into frustrations with the interface
[01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:01.720]   for getting to and switching between apps that
[01:17:01.720 --> 01:17:03.280]   are many, many screens apart.
[01:17:03.280 --> 01:17:07.400]   I mean, I have no idea what the answer is to that.
[01:17:07.400 --> 01:17:09.120]   But we're still-- I mean, you really
[01:17:09.120 --> 01:17:11.760]   do-- you sit there and go through nine screens on your iPhone.
[01:17:11.760 --> 01:17:13.720]   And really, you can still kind of tell
[01:17:13.720 --> 01:17:17.360]   that you're using a home screen interface that dates back
[01:17:17.360 --> 01:17:22.240]   to the original no third party apps iPhone 1 screen
[01:17:22.240 --> 01:17:26.240]   with 16 icons on it, interface.
[01:17:26.240 --> 01:17:31.560]   So I would hope to see a refresh of the home screen
[01:17:31.560 --> 01:17:32.600]   interface.
[01:17:32.600 --> 01:17:34.840]   I definitely think we're going to see something related
[01:17:34.840 --> 01:17:38.600]   to background tasks.
[01:17:38.600 --> 01:17:39.920]   OK.
[01:17:39.920 --> 01:17:43.080]   You have a good reason to think that.
[01:17:43.080 --> 01:17:46.800]   I think that there's probably some developers
[01:17:46.800 --> 01:17:50.480]   of very popular third party iPhone applications
[01:17:50.480 --> 01:17:54.000]   who are toiling away in some secret dungeon in Cupertino
[01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:56.000]   as we talk.
[01:17:56.000 --> 01:17:57.840]   God.
[01:17:57.840 --> 01:17:59.640]   What else would we like to see?
[01:17:59.640 --> 01:18:00.480]   Andy, you're back.
[01:18:00.480 --> 01:18:05.360]   Thank you for killing the dog or whatever it is.
[01:18:05.360 --> 01:18:07.880]   No, I just went-- who's your good-- who's your bad--
[01:18:07.880 --> 01:18:09.800]   came over here and walked away from that.
[01:18:09.800 --> 01:18:11.320]   She's such a good girl.
[01:18:11.320 --> 01:18:15.360]   And then you ate the ball, and it's gone.
[01:18:15.360 --> 01:18:16.120]   4.0.
[01:18:16.120 --> 01:18:16.840]   What else?
[01:18:16.840 --> 01:18:19.280]   Any surprises?
[01:18:19.280 --> 01:18:21.840]   I think you're unified inbox.
[01:18:21.840 --> 01:18:23.160]   Yes, Steve said that, right?
[01:18:23.160 --> 01:18:23.720]   He said it in there.
[01:18:23.720 --> 01:18:25.800]   Yeah, Steve said in one of his--
[01:18:25.800 --> 01:18:26.320]   Yes.
[01:18:26.320 --> 01:18:26.960]   --one word--
[01:18:26.960 --> 01:18:27.480]   Yeah.
[01:18:27.480 --> 01:18:29.240]   Yeah, the leaking guy there at Apple
[01:18:29.240 --> 01:18:30.440]   keeps leaving these details.
[01:18:30.440 --> 01:18:31.120]   And--
[01:18:31.120 --> 01:18:32.120]   Yep.
[01:18:32.120 --> 01:18:34.680]   We did that.
[01:18:34.680 --> 01:18:37.720]   Yeah, so that's a unified inbox.
[01:18:37.720 --> 01:18:38.680]   And I agree with John.
[01:18:38.680 --> 01:18:40.720]   Something needs to be done about springboard.
[01:18:40.720 --> 01:18:43.320]   When you jailbreak your phone, you have categories.
[01:18:43.320 --> 01:18:45.080]   This is one of the applications you can use.
[01:18:45.080 --> 01:18:47.080]   And it punches everything into a folder,
[01:18:47.080 --> 01:18:49.200]   but it's really slow and it's kind of an ugly way
[01:18:49.200 --> 01:18:49.920]   to have to go.
[01:18:49.920 --> 01:18:52.640]   But there does need to be some kind of hierarchy there
[01:18:52.640 --> 01:18:54.760]   so that you can get to those--
[01:18:54.760 --> 01:18:58.440]   I don't know how many 80 apps that you have on an iPhone.
[01:18:58.440 --> 01:19:00.280]   Audio streaming certainly is some of your people
[01:19:00.280 --> 01:19:01.720]   are already asking for on the iPad.
[01:19:01.720 --> 01:19:06.280]   So you want to be able to have that kind of sending media
[01:19:06.280 --> 01:19:09.440]   across to other devices and maybe wireless thinking
[01:19:09.440 --> 01:19:11.080]   to go along with it.
[01:19:11.080 --> 01:19:14.320]   And if that means that you're going to suck up your battery
[01:19:14.320 --> 01:19:16.440]   more quickly, maybe that becomes the selling point
[01:19:16.440 --> 01:19:19.120]   for the next iPhone is they all, by the way,
[01:19:19.120 --> 01:19:20.960]   we have much better battery life than these things.
[01:19:20.960 --> 01:19:23.560]   And so now this other stuff is possible.
[01:19:23.560 --> 01:19:26.400]   So there's 11 pages of 16 icons each.
[01:19:26.400 --> 01:19:27.760]   Is that 176 icons?
[01:19:27.760 --> 01:19:29.200]   Is that what it is?
[01:19:29.200 --> 01:19:31.040]   Somebody actually called the radio shirts
[01:19:31.040 --> 01:19:33.160]   that I have more than 176 applications.
[01:19:33.160 --> 01:19:34.280]   What can I do?
[01:19:34.280 --> 01:19:34.760]   I said--
[01:19:34.760 --> 01:19:35.160]   You know what?
[01:19:35.160 --> 01:19:36.040]   You can sync them.
[01:19:36.040 --> 01:19:36.880]   They go there.
[01:19:36.880 --> 01:19:38.080]   They go there and just can't see them
[01:19:38.080 --> 01:19:39.360]   and you have to search for them.
[01:19:39.360 --> 01:19:43.240]   And you can never get to them even if you delete other apps
[01:19:43.240 --> 01:19:44.000]   to make room.
[01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:45.200]   They don't slide into place.
[01:19:45.200 --> 01:19:46.480]   They stay-- it's like limbo.
[01:19:46.480 --> 01:19:48.080]   You know, it's like 12.
[01:19:48.080 --> 01:19:50.040]   It's like these scary stories you're all right.
[01:19:50.040 --> 01:19:50.560]   You're not the only one.
[01:19:50.560 --> 01:19:51.680]   You just tell me about--
[01:19:51.680 --> 01:19:53.480]   But you can't-- you know, somebody tell me you can--
[01:19:53.480 --> 01:19:55.280]   you go to the search thing and you type in the name,
[01:19:55.280 --> 01:19:56.880]   they will-- you can launch them.
[01:19:56.880 --> 01:19:59.760]   I didn't realize-- it took me a couple weeks
[01:19:59.760 --> 01:20:02.000]   to realize that I had-- because I had more apps
[01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:03.320]   than I had than there were pages.
[01:20:03.320 --> 01:20:05.120]   And it took me a couple weeks to realize--
[01:20:05.120 --> 01:20:06.840]   because I just-- I gave up on trying to find them.
[01:20:06.840 --> 01:20:08.440]   I just use search search.
[01:20:08.440 --> 01:20:10.240]   I don't-- like I just-- you know, the ones
[01:20:10.240 --> 01:20:12.120]   that I use most often are in the first two pages
[01:20:12.120 --> 01:20:15.800]   and the rest of them are just this holding category of their stuff
[01:20:15.800 --> 01:20:16.800]   and I'm just going to search for it
[01:20:16.800 --> 01:20:18.320]   because I'm not going to look for it anymore.
[01:20:18.320 --> 01:20:19.840]   And I definitely think that--
[01:20:19.840 --> 01:20:21.720]   so I didn't even know that they were in limbo for a long time
[01:20:21.720 --> 01:20:22.960]   until I tried to show someone.
[01:20:22.960 --> 01:20:24.120]   And I was trying to find it.
[01:20:24.120 --> 01:20:26.480]   And I realized I hadn't been looking for a long time.
[01:20:26.480 --> 01:20:26.960]   Yeah.
[01:20:26.960 --> 01:20:29.600]   Yeah.
[01:20:29.600 --> 01:20:33.080]   Unified inbox, background processes.
[01:20:33.080 --> 01:20:34.880]   Here's another thing, though, about the--
[01:20:34.880 --> 01:20:37.040]   here's just something to think about--
[01:20:37.040 --> 01:20:38.200]   the march of progress.
[01:20:38.200 --> 01:20:40.080]   So at what point do they-- does Apple
[01:20:40.080 --> 01:20:43.480]   stop supporting the original iPhone and iPod touch?
[01:20:43.480 --> 01:20:47.480]   Is this going to be the first release where they say, you know,
[01:20:47.480 --> 01:20:48.600]   here's the new OS.
[01:20:48.600 --> 01:20:49.760]   It's a free update.
[01:20:49.760 --> 01:20:52.600]   But only for those of you who've bought, say,
[01:20:52.600 --> 01:20:54.640]   the 3G or later.
[01:20:54.640 --> 01:20:57.320]   I think that's probably a good bet.
[01:20:57.320 --> 01:21:00.440]   And it'd be interesting to see how many people
[01:21:00.440 --> 01:21:04.880]   with their original iPhones who've gotten three years of free OS
[01:21:04.880 --> 01:21:07.480]   updates start crying about how they've been ripped off.
[01:21:07.480 --> 01:21:15.440]   Or if maybe they'll get it, but the new features don't--
[01:21:15.440 --> 01:21:20.640]   if there's multitasking, it only works on the 3GS and later,
[01:21:20.640 --> 01:21:21.920]   something like that.
[01:21:21.920 --> 01:21:24.240]   Yeah, and they've done it already.
[01:21:24.240 --> 01:21:26.320]   They did with the iPod touch, right?
[01:21:26.320 --> 01:21:28.200]   Well, with some of the stuff, it only
[01:21:28.200 --> 01:21:30.040]   works with the 3G and later.
[01:21:30.040 --> 01:21:33.720]   So that's an interesting proposition to actually cut off
[01:21:33.720 --> 01:21:35.520]   the OS at that point.
[01:21:35.520 --> 01:21:37.320]   Yeah, you know, it's been out a couple of years.
[01:21:37.320 --> 01:21:38.600]   So here.
[01:21:38.600 --> 01:21:39.640]   And I think you're right.
[01:21:39.640 --> 01:21:42.520]   I think it will take a tenth of a second before we
[01:21:42.520 --> 01:21:44.800]   see the first gripe about why they ripped me off.
[01:21:44.800 --> 01:21:47.360]   I've only been-- had this thing since the first day.
[01:21:47.360 --> 01:21:49.600]   And you're not going to happen eventually.
[01:21:49.600 --> 01:21:50.120]   What?
[01:21:50.120 --> 01:21:50.600]   There's no way--
[01:21:50.600 --> 01:21:53.280]   there's no way that they're going to get into a situation
[01:21:53.280 --> 01:21:55.240]   where, four years from now, they're still
[01:21:55.240 --> 01:21:57.160]   doing OS updates for old iPhones.
[01:21:57.160 --> 01:21:59.360]   I mean, it has to happen.
[01:21:59.360 --> 01:22:00.360]   Yeah.
[01:22:00.360 --> 01:22:00.800]   What about--
[01:22:00.800 --> 01:22:02.040]   I think we have a pattern of that.
[01:22:02.040 --> 01:22:04.120]   I think that Apple doesn't really put up with that
[01:22:04.120 --> 01:22:04.760]   for very long.
[01:22:04.760 --> 01:22:07.480]   I mean, usually, I'm surprised at how many computers actually
[01:22:07.480 --> 01:22:09.360]   are backwards, but they'll cut that stuff off.
[01:22:09.360 --> 01:22:10.760]   And then they'll be a class action suit.
[01:22:10.760 --> 01:22:11.720]   And then they'll be--
[01:22:11.720 --> 01:22:13.200]   Right.
[01:22:13.200 --> 01:22:14.200]   What about--
[01:22:14.200 --> 01:22:15.200]   I'll be--
[01:22:15.200 --> 01:22:16.040]   Go ahead, Annie.
[01:22:16.040 --> 01:22:18.680]   I'll be coming to the announcement most carefully for clues
[01:22:18.680 --> 01:22:21.320]   as to what the next version of the hardware is going to be.
[01:22:21.320 --> 01:22:22.600]   Yes, that's my next question.
[01:22:22.600 --> 01:22:23.840]   What about hardware?
[01:22:23.840 --> 01:22:25.400]   Yeah, I mean, that's got to be-- the fact
[01:22:25.400 --> 01:22:29.320]   that they're doing this now has to be a tip off that they're
[01:22:29.320 --> 01:22:32.320]   going to be introducing a new phone that has features that
[01:22:32.320 --> 01:22:35.120]   must be supported by software.
[01:22:35.120 --> 01:22:37.120]   And that--
[01:22:37.120 --> 01:22:39.120]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:22:39.120 --> 01:22:44.480]   OK, so that's a catter in a guanor.
[01:22:44.480 --> 01:22:45.480]   What other--
[01:22:45.480 --> 01:22:48.400]   No, it's the scariest dog toy ever,
[01:22:48.400 --> 01:22:50.920]   because it is a realistic-looking bird that
[01:22:50.920 --> 01:22:54.720]   shrieks in pain when bitten into by a dog.
[01:22:54.720 --> 01:22:55.720]   That's what you want.
[01:22:55.720 --> 01:22:56.440]   That's what you want.
[01:22:56.440 --> 01:22:57.520]   And bleeds.
[01:22:58.520 --> 01:22:59.520]   Yeah.
[01:22:59.520 --> 01:23:00.520]   I'm sorry.
[01:23:00.520 --> 01:23:01.960]   It's an Audubon bird.
[01:23:01.960 --> 01:23:03.160]   I'm sorry.
[01:23:03.160 --> 01:23:05.520]   But my hosts are very, very kind and hard
[01:23:05.520 --> 01:23:06.680]   to put me up for a dire week.
[01:23:06.680 --> 01:23:08.520]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:23:08.520 --> 01:23:10.480]   I'm like, did she get a bird?
[01:23:10.480 --> 01:23:11.480]   Holy--
[01:23:11.480 --> 01:23:13.080]   No, it's just a rubber bird.
[01:23:13.080 --> 01:23:17.080]   So I'm sorry.
[01:23:17.080 --> 01:23:17.600]   What--
[01:23:17.600 --> 01:23:18.080]   Hardware.
[01:23:18.080 --> 01:23:18.580]   Hardware.
[01:23:18.580 --> 01:23:19.080]   Hardware.
[01:23:19.080 --> 01:23:20.320]   Hardware, exactly.
[01:23:20.320 --> 01:23:22.200]   The reason why they're making announcement early,
[01:23:22.200 --> 01:23:24.640]   it must be that they want to be able to release this information
[01:23:24.640 --> 01:23:27.640]   and the development tools to developers on that same day,
[01:23:27.640 --> 01:23:29.840]   so that by the time this phone with the new hardware
[01:23:29.840 --> 01:23:32.160]   and the new features comes out, all the different features
[01:23:32.160 --> 01:23:33.760]   are going to be wired up for it, including--
[01:23:33.760 --> 01:23:36.520]   I'm guessing that multitasking is not going to just apply
[01:23:36.520 --> 01:23:38.880]   to every single app that's released,
[01:23:38.880 --> 01:23:41.280]   that the apps have to be written to a certain specification
[01:23:41.280 --> 01:23:43.960]   and a certain guideline and be savvy enough and talk
[01:23:43.960 --> 01:23:49.120]   to the OS enough about its needs to make that function work.
[01:23:49.120 --> 01:23:50.640]   So I'm very--
[01:23:50.640 --> 01:23:53.600]   I'm-- it's going to be very cool to find out about iPhone OS 4.0.
[01:23:53.600 --> 01:23:55.960]   But you thought that speculation about the iPad
[01:23:55.960 --> 01:23:59.080]   was just never ending in dull as dishwater.
[01:23:59.080 --> 01:24:01.440]   Wait, we start talking about, OK, so it says
[01:24:01.440 --> 01:24:07.120]   that there's a new NS camera live.cs tool in the library.
[01:24:07.120 --> 01:24:09.320]   Does that mean there's going to be a front-facing camera
[01:24:09.320 --> 01:24:10.040]   for video conference?
[01:24:10.040 --> 01:24:14.600]   A couple of other notes, and then we're
[01:24:14.600 --> 01:24:16.840]   going to get to our picks of the week, which I'm sure
[01:24:16.840 --> 01:24:19.680]   will be fairly iPad focused.
[01:24:19.680 --> 01:24:25.000]   Stories ranged from 200,000 to 300,000 to 700,000 units
[01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:26.080]   sold over the weekend.
[01:24:26.080 --> 01:24:29.680]   I'm not sure what the true answer is.
[01:24:29.680 --> 01:24:32.400]   I'm thinking 300,000 is about, right?
[01:24:32.400 --> 01:24:34.480]   Anybody have a thought about the higher numbers?
[01:24:34.480 --> 01:24:35.760]   Well, Apple claimed they--
[01:24:35.760 --> 01:24:37.280]   Apple did a news release on it and said
[01:24:37.280 --> 01:24:38.880]   it was over 300,000.
[01:24:38.880 --> 01:24:39.200]   OK.
[01:24:39.200 --> 01:24:40.120]   And that was first day.
[01:24:40.120 --> 01:24:43.640]   But I don't think that included the 3G units.
[01:24:43.640 --> 01:24:44.120]   Right.
[01:24:44.120 --> 01:24:45.280]   No, it did not.
[01:24:45.280 --> 01:24:47.720]   It only included the ones that actually shipped.
[01:24:47.720 --> 01:24:49.000]   All right.
[01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:52.840]   So that's a pretty good first day, 300,000 units.
[01:24:52.840 --> 01:24:55.960]   Will the man continue, or is it going to taper off
[01:24:55.960 --> 01:24:59.440]   until the end of the month when the 3G starts shipping?
[01:24:59.440 --> 01:25:00.720]   That's interesting to remember.
[01:25:00.720 --> 01:25:02.280]   Those are--
[01:25:02.280 --> 01:25:03.120]   Go ahead, Annie.
[01:25:03.120 --> 01:25:04.000]   Go ahead.
[01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:06.320]   Although them saying those are all 300,000 people who
[01:25:06.320 --> 01:25:08.680]   bought a site scene, remember.
[01:25:08.680 --> 01:25:11.480]   So if that starts to tail way, way down,
[01:25:11.480 --> 01:25:13.160]   when people start actually seeing them,
[01:25:13.160 --> 01:25:16.840]   and their friends have them, and they see them in hotels,
[01:25:16.840 --> 01:25:19.560]   and on airplanes, they realize, ooh, that's not nearly
[01:25:19.560 --> 01:25:20.760]   as nice as I thought.
[01:25:20.760 --> 01:25:21.640]   That'll be significant.
[01:25:21.640 --> 01:25:25.160]   But on the other side, now we have 300,000 iPad evangelists
[01:25:25.160 --> 01:25:25.840]   out there.
[01:25:25.840 --> 01:25:30.880]   I guarantee that if I had a dozen iPads back in my car
[01:25:30.880 --> 01:25:33.440]   yesterday, I would have sold all 12 of them, just
[01:25:33.440 --> 01:25:36.840]   the people I should have to do at the car.
[01:25:36.840 --> 01:25:39.280]   We're small, just a handling fee.
[01:25:39.280 --> 01:25:42.360]   It's tiny handling fee.
[01:25:42.360 --> 01:25:43.160]   They really should.
[01:25:43.160 --> 01:25:46.800]   I mean, I think that that's how it's going to play out.
[01:25:46.800 --> 01:25:49.960]   It's obviously-- yeah, most people don't buy something site
[01:25:49.960 --> 01:25:53.400]   unseen, not for $500, $600.
[01:25:53.400 --> 01:25:55.520]   I think once people see this, I think
[01:25:55.520 --> 01:25:57.920]   they're going to jump at it.
[01:25:57.920 --> 01:26:00.440]   That's just the reaction I've had from the people who've
[01:26:00.440 --> 01:26:04.040]   seen mine, is if there was an app that they had on it
[01:26:04.040 --> 01:26:06.640]   where they could tap it and put their information in to get one,
[01:26:06.640 --> 01:26:08.360]   and you'd get some kind of referral credit,
[01:26:08.360 --> 01:26:10.080]   it would be like a Ponzi scheme.
[01:26:10.080 --> 01:26:12.600]   You'd make your money back in a week.
[01:26:12.600 --> 01:26:14.200]   They'd pay me an iPad.
[01:26:14.200 --> 01:26:15.000]   Right.
[01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:16.000]   Yeah, they should just pay you.
[01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:19.120]   They could just pay you an iPad, and then you sell them out.
[01:26:19.120 --> 01:26:20.160]   But they really do.
[01:26:20.160 --> 01:26:21.800]   People use it, and they want to buy one.
[01:26:21.800 --> 01:26:25.280]   Well, and what's crazy is that usually I was really afraid
[01:26:25.280 --> 01:26:27.680]   that I was going to over-hype it to myself.
[01:26:27.680 --> 01:26:28.880]   I've been talking about it.
[01:26:28.880 --> 01:26:31.560]   I'm excited about it for years, and I had this big imagination.
[01:26:31.560 --> 01:26:32.400]   And there are some--
[01:26:32.400 --> 01:26:34.080]   well, there's a couple of things that I can complain about
[01:26:34.080 --> 01:26:35.280]   related to it.
[01:26:35.280 --> 01:26:38.280]   There are so many things about it that are just better than I
[01:26:38.280 --> 01:26:39.040]   expected.
[01:26:39.040 --> 01:26:40.480]   It works better than I expected.
[01:26:40.480 --> 01:26:42.920]   And I think that they've kind of gotten over that hump,
[01:26:42.920 --> 01:26:45.280]   over that hill that they had to get over,
[01:26:45.280 --> 01:26:48.000]   that we didn't go, well, it's not as good, but it's still great,
[01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:49.960]   but it's not as good as we thought it would be.
[01:26:49.960 --> 01:26:55.040]   And it's a very, very stable, very strong version one.
[01:26:55.040 --> 01:26:58.920]   And I think that's going to really yield a lot of sales.
[01:26:58.920 --> 01:27:02.400]   And of course, eventually international sales.
[01:27:02.400 --> 01:27:04.040]   Yeah, we haven't even talked about it.
[01:27:04.040 --> 01:27:04.560]   Right.
[01:27:04.560 --> 01:27:05.240]   At some point.
[01:27:05.240 --> 01:27:10.320]   Some reports that people were having Wi-Fi issues.
[01:27:10.320 --> 01:27:12.480]   Anybody here having Wi-Fi issues?
[01:27:12.480 --> 01:27:15.000]   I think that Apple has a knowledge base article they posted
[01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:18.320]   yesterday with suggestions for Remedy.
[01:27:18.320 --> 01:27:21.800]   I've seen wild fluctuations in my Wi-Fi coverage,
[01:27:21.800 --> 01:27:24.240]   especially when I have a Wi-Fi sitting right behind it.
[01:27:24.240 --> 01:27:27.360]   And it goes up and down.
[01:27:27.360 --> 01:27:29.600]   But I haven't seen any change in performance.
[01:27:29.600 --> 01:27:32.400]   So I mean, the display has changed for me.
[01:27:32.400 --> 01:27:35.160]   But I haven't noticed that it's been dropping off.
[01:27:35.160 --> 01:27:37.160]   Some say that if it's an Apple only network,
[01:27:37.160 --> 01:27:40.560]   these problems don't exist.
[01:27:40.560 --> 01:27:44.120]   I had one bar and it just switched to five bars.
[01:27:44.120 --> 01:27:46.240]   As if it knew I was talking about it.
[01:27:46.240 --> 01:27:48.760]   And I haven't moved anything.
[01:27:48.760 --> 01:27:49.480]   Nothing's changed.
[01:27:49.480 --> 01:27:50.760]   It's just kind of fluctuates.
[01:27:50.760 --> 01:27:53.280]   On the other hand, I've never lost connectivity.
[01:27:53.280 --> 01:27:56.160]   Some people have complained also about repeated requests
[01:27:56.160 --> 01:27:58.760]   for authentication.
[01:27:58.760 --> 01:28:01.120]   When you get a new device, I think you're going to see stuff
[01:28:01.120 --> 01:28:01.440]   like this.
[01:28:01.440 --> 01:28:02.960]   I don't know how widespread this problem is.
[01:28:02.960 --> 01:28:04.680]   Also, somebody said in the chat room
[01:28:04.680 --> 01:28:06.080]   that people have reported overheating.
[01:28:06.080 --> 01:28:07.400]   I think that seems unlikely.
[01:28:07.400 --> 01:28:09.320]   This is one of the few devices I've ever seen that
[01:28:09.320 --> 01:28:11.640]   doesn't get warm at all.
[01:28:11.640 --> 01:28:13.480]   I think what they're talking about
[01:28:13.480 --> 01:28:16.120]   is that there's reports that if you leave it in the sun,
[01:28:16.120 --> 01:28:18.240]   like in the backseat of a car or you're outside,
[01:28:18.240 --> 01:28:19.800]   it's indirect sunlight.
[01:28:19.800 --> 01:28:21.920]   And then if it reaches a certain temperature,
[01:28:21.920 --> 01:28:24.840]   it does give you an alert that says your iPad is too hot
[01:28:24.840 --> 01:28:27.000]   and you should shut it off.
[01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:30.000]   But I don't think that's from use indoors.
[01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:31.120]   I mean, it really--
[01:28:31.120 --> 01:28:31.520]   It doesn't--
[01:28:31.520 --> 01:28:33.160]   It's unbelievable how it doesn't get hot.
[01:28:33.160 --> 01:28:35.640]   Well, and the fact that Apple's own case is basically a wet
[01:28:35.640 --> 01:28:39.840]   seat, tells you that it can't get too hot.
[01:28:39.840 --> 01:28:40.800]   I mean, this thing is rubber.
[01:28:40.800 --> 01:28:41.920]   It's like sealing it in rubber.
[01:28:41.920 --> 01:28:43.240]   There's no ventilation at all.
[01:28:43.240 --> 01:28:46.320]   Andy?
[01:28:46.320 --> 01:28:48.840]   I'm definitely heating up my iPad more than the iPad's heating up
[01:28:48.840 --> 01:28:49.280]   me.
[01:28:49.280 --> 01:28:51.280]   That's the first for computing devices.
[01:28:51.280 --> 01:28:53.960]   It's pretty amazing, actually, that they could make this thing
[01:28:53.960 --> 01:28:54.960]   run as cool as it is.
[01:28:54.960 --> 01:28:58.000]   Again, I think perhaps that's the key is the A4.
[01:28:58.000 --> 01:29:01.120]   Did anybody look at the teardown that I fix it did?
[01:29:01.120 --> 01:29:01.880]   Yeah.
[01:29:01.880 --> 01:29:02.920]   What's fascinating?
[01:29:02.920 --> 01:29:03.120]   Yeah.
[01:29:03.120 --> 01:29:05.600]   One of the things that says there's room for a camera.
[01:29:05.600 --> 01:29:08.960]   I don't know if that's true or not.
[01:29:08.960 --> 01:29:10.880]   Well, the whole thing, I mean, really, you look at the inside
[01:29:10.880 --> 01:29:13.880]   and it's just a piece of glass and a battery.
[01:29:13.880 --> 01:29:16.160]   I mean, everything else is so tiny.
[01:29:16.160 --> 01:29:18.880]   I mean, there's speculation that a lot of those parts really
[01:29:18.880 --> 01:29:22.200]   could just fit into a future iPhone as is.
[01:29:22.200 --> 01:29:24.320]   Wow.
[01:29:24.320 --> 01:29:27.280]   It's just all battery in there.
[01:29:27.280 --> 01:29:28.280]   That's pretty impressive.
[01:29:28.280 --> 01:29:30.440]   Which I think was the key, because when you look at the HP
[01:29:30.440 --> 01:29:34.360]   that they're talking about coming out, it's $525 or something.
[01:29:34.360 --> 01:29:36.880]   And it has five hours of battery life.
[01:29:36.880 --> 01:29:37.920]   It's going to be--
[01:29:37.920 --> 01:29:39.760]   I mean, I think they definitely focus on the right things
[01:29:39.760 --> 01:29:42.080]   that are going to make it very difficult to compete with.
[01:29:42.080 --> 01:29:42.600]   All right.
[01:29:42.600 --> 01:29:46.200]   I think that they focused on were responsiveness.
[01:29:46.200 --> 01:29:47.920]   You know, I mean, everything you touch on this thing
[01:29:47.920 --> 01:29:51.280]   makes your iPhone feel like it's not responsive to your touch.
[01:29:51.280 --> 01:29:54.200]   I mean, it's just so super responsive to touch.
[01:29:54.200 --> 01:29:58.560]   Responsiveness, battery life, and keep it at $500.
[01:29:58.560 --> 01:30:01.880]   And then build it out from there.
[01:30:01.880 --> 01:30:04.920]   You think battery life is unlike any Apple--
[01:30:04.920 --> 01:30:05.520]   It's amazing.
[01:30:05.520 --> 01:30:06.960]   Big computer they've ever had.
[01:30:06.960 --> 01:30:11.240]   Do you think version two, it will be a year from now,
[01:30:11.240 --> 01:30:14.360]   and it will have a camera?
[01:30:14.360 --> 01:30:16.400]   I'd be very surprised if there wasn't a camera.
[01:30:16.400 --> 01:30:18.400]   I mean, just very-- you know, in the next version.
[01:30:18.400 --> 01:30:18.720]   And I--
[01:30:18.720 --> 01:30:20.360]   You think, having used it now, I feel like you
[01:30:20.360 --> 01:30:21.320]   ought to have a camera.
[01:30:21.320 --> 01:30:23.640]   First, for a long time, I thought, now it's a content
[01:30:23.640 --> 01:30:26.160]   consumption device that doesn't need a camera.
[01:30:26.160 --> 01:30:27.120]   But now I feel like, yeah, I wouldn't
[01:30:27.120 --> 01:30:28.560]   mind having a camera this thing.
[01:30:28.560 --> 01:30:29.560]   I mean, I think that the two things--
[01:30:29.560 --> 01:30:30.560]   I mean, I would love to see a camera.
[01:30:30.560 --> 01:30:31.920]   I'd love to see-- and the thing is,
[01:30:31.920 --> 01:30:33.960]   is for people who haven't bought one yet,
[01:30:33.960 --> 01:30:36.080]   I would definitely-- and we bought them
[01:30:36.080 --> 01:30:38.800]   because this is what we cover.
[01:30:38.800 --> 01:30:42.600]   But I would say that if I was going to buy my only iPad,
[01:30:42.600 --> 01:30:44.880]   I'd probably get the 3G version.
[01:30:44.880 --> 01:30:47.400]   I think that that-- I noticed missing it almost immediately.
[01:30:47.400 --> 01:30:48.760]   I couldn't find my iPhone.
[01:30:48.760 --> 01:30:51.200]   And it was like within an hour, I was like, oh,
[01:30:51.200 --> 01:30:52.520]   I need to be connected.
[01:30:52.520 --> 01:30:53.320]   I think you really do.
[01:30:53.320 --> 01:30:55.040]   I think you really do want full-time connection.
[01:30:55.040 --> 01:30:57.800]   In fact, I've ordered this 3G for that very reason.
[01:30:57.800 --> 01:30:59.880]   I think it probably depends on whether you
[01:30:59.880 --> 01:31:01.760]   have an iPhone or an iPod touch.
[01:31:01.760 --> 01:31:04.800]   If you have an iPod touch, which I don't,
[01:31:04.800 --> 01:31:07.800]   you're used to then being only having connection
[01:31:07.800 --> 01:31:08.960]   when you're on Wi-Fi.
[01:31:08.960 --> 01:31:11.200]   If you have an iPhone, which I do,
[01:31:11.200 --> 01:31:13.520]   this feels so much like an iPhone.
[01:31:13.520 --> 01:31:16.320]   It just has that same feel that I just assumed--
[01:31:16.320 --> 01:31:17.680]   I mean, I was the same way.
[01:31:17.680 --> 01:31:19.560]   The UPS guy came to my house at 10.30,
[01:31:19.560 --> 01:31:23.560]   and I went to lunch with my son at like 12.30.
[01:31:23.560 --> 01:31:25.600]   And we're like, well, let's take the iPad.
[01:31:25.600 --> 01:31:28.280]   And I was like, one step out the door when I went.
[01:31:28.280 --> 01:31:29.480]   I was like, hey, let's check Twitter.
[01:31:29.480 --> 01:31:32.840]   And I was like, oh, I got nothing.
[01:31:32.840 --> 01:31:35.200]   And I just-- I knew-- I mean, I know
[01:31:35.200 --> 01:31:38.200]   that it doesn't have 3G, but it just feels like I should.
[01:31:38.200 --> 01:31:41.840]   It feels like I should have internet everywhere.
[01:31:41.840 --> 01:31:43.960]   It really feels like bizarre that I don't.
[01:31:43.960 --> 01:31:45.040]   I do think I'm going to get a--
[01:31:45.040 --> 01:31:46.360]   I'm going to build into my Apple case,
[01:31:46.360 --> 01:31:47.880]   because I don't think I'm going to keep my Apple case.
[01:31:47.880 --> 01:31:48.800]   I'm going to get another one.
[01:31:48.800 --> 01:31:52.080]   But as my travel case, I feel like I
[01:31:52.080 --> 01:31:54.520]   want to build a little pocket for my Wi-Fi
[01:31:54.520 --> 01:31:57.440]   that I can just kind of slide into the back of it
[01:31:57.440 --> 01:31:58.360]   so that it just--
[01:31:58.360 --> 01:32:00.880]   At least getting-- I'm just going to get Velcro for the back
[01:32:00.880 --> 01:32:02.560]   so that I can just slap it onto the back,
[01:32:02.560 --> 01:32:04.880]   because I think that I'm going to be using it all the time.
[01:32:04.880 --> 01:32:08.360]   This Griffin case does have a little slots for business cards.
[01:32:08.360 --> 01:32:09.840]   And I bet you could stick a Wi-Fi.
[01:32:09.840 --> 01:32:11.880]   I wonder-- and that's the other thing, too,
[01:32:11.880 --> 01:32:15.240]   is I wonder whether it's better to get the 3G iPad
[01:32:15.240 --> 01:32:16.440]   or to get a Wi-Fi.
[01:32:16.440 --> 01:32:18.560]   I mean, I feel like at this point,
[01:32:18.560 --> 01:32:19.760]   I have to get one or the other.
[01:32:19.760 --> 01:32:20.680]   I mean--
[01:32:20.680 --> 01:32:21.240]   Right.
[01:32:21.240 --> 01:32:22.320]   I've been using the Wi-Fi.
[01:32:22.320 --> 01:32:23.560]   I took the train to New York.
[01:32:23.560 --> 01:32:24.920]   I mean, although those of us--
[01:32:24.920 --> 01:32:28.200]   Andy and I both probably ride the train quite a lot.
[01:32:28.200 --> 01:32:30.400]   I just can't-- I mean, I can't imagine having the iPad
[01:32:30.400 --> 01:32:32.080]   on a train and not having internet.
[01:32:32.080 --> 01:32:33.400]   I mean, it's just--
[01:32:33.400 --> 01:32:35.840]   I jump off the train and kill myself.
[01:32:35.840 --> 01:32:36.760]   Andy, what are you showing me?
[01:32:36.760 --> 01:32:37.680]   What's that?
[01:32:37.680 --> 01:32:39.280]   No, no, I was just trying-- a friend of mine
[01:32:39.280 --> 01:32:40.280]   is really handy.
[01:32:40.280 --> 01:32:41.960]   She, like, so is just about everything.
[01:32:41.960 --> 01:32:44.480]   So she made me a iPad slip case.
[01:32:44.480 --> 01:32:48.440]   And at my request, it has a integrated Wi-Fi pocket.
[01:32:48.440 --> 01:32:50.920]   And it's really cool because I can't take out my own Wi-Fi
[01:32:50.920 --> 01:32:53.240]   because that's what's powering this webcast.
[01:32:53.240 --> 01:32:54.680]   But it's slightly translucent.
[01:32:54.680 --> 01:32:56.720]   It's slightly translucent.
[01:32:56.720 --> 01:32:58.720]   So you can see the green light.
[01:32:58.720 --> 01:33:00.280]   You can actually look at the carbon flow.
[01:33:00.280 --> 01:33:03.880]   Right, so when I'm done with it, I never even take the slip case.
[01:33:03.880 --> 01:33:06.920]   I just sort of press the button through the cloth,
[01:33:06.920 --> 01:33:07.800]   turn it on when I'm done.
[01:33:07.800 --> 01:33:09.880]   Press the button to turn it off again.
[01:33:09.880 --> 01:33:11.440]   The other good feature-- and really,
[01:33:11.440 --> 01:33:13.480]   I hope she opens a Dead Sea store to solve these.
[01:33:13.480 --> 01:33:15.080]   Because this is exactly what you should do.
[01:33:15.080 --> 01:33:17.520]   It's also-- it's lined with flannel.
[01:33:17.520 --> 01:33:19.880]   So it cleans your screen as you use it.
[01:33:19.880 --> 01:33:20.480]   Exactly.
[01:33:20.480 --> 01:33:22.120]   It becomes a cleaning cloth.
[01:33:22.120 --> 01:33:22.720]   Oh, that's nice.
[01:33:22.720 --> 01:33:24.520]   Now, you'd think it'd be charging $19.95.
[01:33:24.520 --> 01:33:26.080]   But with you, you could say, if you act right now,
[01:33:26.080 --> 01:33:28.480]   we'll give you a second.
[01:33:28.480 --> 01:33:29.280]   I patch it.
[01:33:29.280 --> 01:33:30.960]   Wow.
[01:33:30.960 --> 01:33:32.440]   You really do want to keep it--
[01:33:32.440 --> 01:33:35.040]   You do want to have room in your case for a cleaning cloth,
[01:33:35.040 --> 01:33:37.320]   too, because you don't notice it till it's off.
[01:33:37.320 --> 01:33:39.200]   But when it's off, boy, this is disgusting.
[01:33:39.200 --> 01:33:41.800]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:33:41.800 --> 01:33:43.840]   I think I said my review.
[01:33:43.840 --> 01:33:45.520]   It looks like after a full day's use,
[01:33:45.520 --> 01:33:48.320]   it looks slightly like someone's just given birth to it,
[01:33:48.320 --> 01:33:49.960]   which is tough.
[01:33:49.960 --> 01:33:52.760]   And it's harder to do the thing you can do with an iPhone
[01:33:52.760 --> 01:33:55.240]   where you just slyly wipe it on your shirt
[01:33:55.240 --> 01:33:56.920]   or whatever it's sly.
[01:33:56.920 --> 01:33:57.440]   Yeah.
[01:33:57.440 --> 01:33:58.400]   You really have to bake.
[01:33:58.400 --> 01:34:00.400]   This is--
[01:34:00.400 --> 01:34:01.400]   I was--
[01:34:01.400 --> 01:34:04.080]   Say again, Andy?
[01:34:04.080 --> 01:34:04.440]   I'm sorry.
[01:34:04.440 --> 01:34:07.240]   I keep the lag needs-- it makes it hard for me
[01:34:07.240 --> 01:34:08.880]   to find where the caps are on the car.
[01:34:08.880 --> 01:34:12.720]   No, you can't insert your bomb wall appropriately.
[01:34:12.720 --> 01:34:13.920]   Exactly.
[01:34:13.920 --> 01:34:17.120]   But yeah, no, my file, I think, is a really fantastic accessory
[01:34:17.120 --> 01:34:18.800]   for this.
[01:34:18.800 --> 01:34:22.040]   If you're not paying for wireless broadband anyplace else,
[01:34:22.040 --> 01:34:23.360]   it might-- and you don't feel as though you're
[01:34:23.360 --> 01:34:24.800]   going to have more devices.
[01:34:24.800 --> 01:34:27.480]   It kind of makes sense to go for the $30 plan
[01:34:27.480 --> 01:34:30.680]   because it's a lot cheaper than the industry standard $50
[01:34:30.680 --> 01:34:33.640]   or $60 a month that the MyFi charges.
[01:34:33.640 --> 01:34:35.960]   But if you have-- also have the need to-- well,
[01:34:35.960 --> 01:34:38.160]   I also want to be able to get my laptop online.
[01:34:38.160 --> 01:34:39.760]   I also want to get other devices online.
[01:34:39.760 --> 01:34:42.920]   I might have a game system that I might want to get online.
[01:34:42.920 --> 01:34:45.720]   Really, that's the last best bill you ever
[01:34:45.720 --> 01:34:49.200]   pay for a monthly broadband ever.
[01:34:49.200 --> 01:34:51.600]   For that said, I do have a 3G model coming in a few weeks,
[01:34:51.600 --> 01:34:53.640]   chiefly because I'm writing that book about it.
[01:34:53.640 --> 01:34:56.200]   But if I do not have that obligation,
[01:34:56.200 --> 01:34:59.520]   I probably would have just stuck with the Wi-Fi version
[01:34:59.520 --> 01:35:01.560]   and doubled it up with the MyFi.
[01:35:01.560 --> 01:35:02.840]   Well, there's an advantage to the MyFi.
[01:35:02.840 --> 01:35:04.040]   It's spreader Verizon.
[01:35:04.040 --> 01:35:05.880]   It's not AT&T.
[01:35:05.880 --> 01:35:06.320]   Exactly.
[01:35:06.320 --> 01:35:07.560]   It's a run-up network.
[01:35:07.560 --> 01:35:11.040]   I mean, if Apple ever opened-- if AT&T ever opened up
[01:35:11.040 --> 01:35:13.440]   tethering on the iPad or on the iPhone,
[01:35:13.440 --> 01:35:15.160]   that might be a different thing entirely.
[01:35:15.160 --> 01:35:15.680]   Like the ability to--
[01:35:15.680 --> 01:35:17.880]   Is it people think tethering for--
[01:35:17.880 --> 01:35:19.160]   I guess it's already in the US.
[01:35:19.160 --> 01:35:20.320]   No, it's already there.
[01:35:20.320 --> 01:35:21.440]   It's just the US.
[01:35:21.440 --> 01:35:22.440]   It's just the US.
[01:35:22.440 --> 01:35:23.800]   AT&T.
[01:35:23.800 --> 01:35:24.600]   The question is--
[01:35:24.600 --> 01:35:27.920]   The big question is do you think AT&T is going to let us
[01:35:27.920 --> 01:35:29.760]   use it before 4.0 comes out?
[01:35:29.760 --> 01:35:32.000]   Or are they going to go an entire calendar year
[01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:35.040]   where it's enabled in the OS and everybody all
[01:35:35.040 --> 01:35:38.880]   over around the world is using it and we're not?
[01:35:38.880 --> 01:35:40.000]   I would bet no.
[01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:42.880]   I would bet no, we're not going to see it until--
[01:35:42.880 --> 01:35:43.640]   who knows when.
[01:35:43.640 --> 01:35:44.200]   I don't know.
[01:35:44.200 --> 01:35:47.800]   I wouldn't bet we ever see it.
[01:35:47.800 --> 01:35:49.200]   Any other last story?
[01:35:49.200 --> 01:35:51.600]   Oh, we didn't really talk about this slate, Adam.
[01:35:51.600 --> 01:35:54.520]   This is the HP competitor and Adam-based processor,
[01:35:54.520 --> 01:35:56.920]   at least according to the leak that Engadget published.
[01:35:56.920 --> 01:36:02.720]   It looked like a top secret HP presentation slide.
[01:36:02.720 --> 01:36:06.840]   It will cost less but lower battery life.
[01:36:06.840 --> 01:36:07.960]   It will have a camera.
[01:36:07.960 --> 01:36:09.040]   It will have multitasking.
[01:36:09.040 --> 01:36:11.400]   It will have Windows 7.
[01:36:11.400 --> 01:36:14.480]   I guess the real question is will it
[01:36:14.480 --> 01:36:16.960]   be as easy to use as the iPad?
[01:36:16.960 --> 01:36:18.760]   Will it compete with the iPad or will it just
[01:36:18.760 --> 01:36:21.000]   be yet another Windows tablet of which
[01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:23.600]   we've seen quite a few over the last 10 years?
[01:36:23.600 --> 01:36:25.640]   I think there are three major failures.
[01:36:25.640 --> 01:36:28.760]   Number one, I've never seen a desktop OS tablet
[01:36:28.760 --> 01:36:33.240]   that in any way reacted the way that a tablet should.
[01:36:33.240 --> 01:36:35.320]   Smaller screen of 7 tablets.
[01:36:35.320 --> 01:36:39.720]   10, 24 by 600, which I think is a mistake.
[01:36:39.720 --> 01:36:40.800]   Yeah.
[01:36:40.800 --> 01:36:44.760]   And then you get into the second problem,
[01:36:44.760 --> 01:36:47.520]   which is that they're going to have to make sure they can't--
[01:36:47.520 --> 01:36:50.400]   there's some things they can't cheap out on.
[01:36:50.400 --> 01:36:53.520]   I was concerned about the iPad because I was expecting
[01:36:53.520 --> 01:36:55.200]   to see a user interface with much bigger buttons
[01:36:55.200 --> 01:36:57.800]   so you can really find it in TAD very, very easily.
[01:36:57.800 --> 01:37:00.600]   Because I'm used to not being able to use tablets well
[01:37:00.600 --> 01:37:02.600]   when they take the desktop operating system,
[01:37:02.600 --> 01:37:03.880]   just shrink it down to the screen.
[01:37:03.880 --> 01:37:06.280]   And now I have to somehow find a closed window box
[01:37:06.280 --> 01:37:07.280]   with this little thing.
[01:37:07.280 --> 01:37:09.960]   But with the iPad, I find that the buttons are the right size.
[01:37:09.960 --> 01:37:11.960]   Maybe it wasn't the size of the buttons that was the problem.
[01:37:11.960 --> 01:37:14.840]   It was the accuracy of the encoder that was the problem.
[01:37:14.840 --> 01:37:18.400]   So if I intend to tap here, that's where that tap registers.
[01:37:18.400 --> 01:37:20.760]   And I've never had a problem really in hitting the buttons
[01:37:20.760 --> 01:37:21.600]   that I am for.
[01:37:21.600 --> 01:37:23.160]   So the problem that HP is going to face
[01:37:23.160 --> 01:37:24.520]   is that if they decided that, gee, we
[01:37:24.520 --> 01:37:26.880]   got to get this to be cheaper than the iPad, well,
[01:37:26.880 --> 01:37:28.920]   let's not use the best encoder possible.
[01:37:28.920 --> 01:37:30.840]   Let's just use something that sort of works.
[01:37:30.840 --> 01:37:33.560]   Then that's going to frustrate the hell out of everybody.
[01:37:33.560 --> 01:37:36.080]   Or they're going to be forced to totally rewrite windows
[01:37:36.080 --> 01:37:37.400]   to make sure that it's able to work
[01:37:37.400 --> 01:37:41.200]   with on the pressure tabs that are about the size of a half
[01:37:41.200 --> 01:37:42.800]   dollar.
[01:37:42.800 --> 01:37:45.160]   Front facing and back facing cameras, by the way,
[01:37:45.160 --> 01:37:47.160]   which is kind of interesting.
[01:37:47.160 --> 01:37:48.240]   So look forward to lots of chats.
[01:37:48.240 --> 01:37:49.560]   You get to see up people's noses.
[01:37:49.560 --> 01:37:51.960]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:37:51.960 --> 01:37:54.720]   It was such a big practical problem that, again,
[01:37:54.720 --> 01:37:56.240]   if you're going to be holding it like this,
[01:37:56.240 --> 01:37:57.960]   you get the upshot.
[01:37:57.960 --> 01:38:00.560]   That's why I'm sort of wondering if the better idea wouldn't
[01:38:00.560 --> 01:38:04.840]   be since the iPad can work in any orientation,
[01:38:04.840 --> 01:38:06.360]   any side can be up.
[01:38:06.360 --> 01:38:09.240]   What if you hold it this way so that the dock connector is now
[01:38:09.240 --> 01:38:12.600]   at the top, and then Apple just makes a simple camera that
[01:38:12.600 --> 01:38:13.600]   snaps on there?
[01:38:13.600 --> 01:38:15.840]   Not only will it be an optional accessory,
[01:38:15.840 --> 01:38:18.160]   but also you can make it rotate and pivot
[01:38:18.160 --> 01:38:20.800]   so you can aim it pretty much wherever you want it to go.
[01:38:20.800 --> 01:38:22.320]   You know, that would be the much better solution.
[01:38:22.320 --> 01:38:24.680]   E-cam sells, and I bought it, and it doesn't work with the--
[01:38:24.680 --> 01:38:27.720]   I was hoping it might long shot work with the iPad.
[01:38:27.720 --> 01:38:28.920]   This thing is the BT1.
[01:38:28.920 --> 01:38:31.280]   It's a Bluetooth camera with microphone,
[01:38:31.280 --> 01:38:33.480]   and it comes with a little tripod.
[01:38:33.480 --> 01:38:36.400]   And the idea would be if you could do this in Bluetooth,
[01:38:36.400 --> 01:38:38.480]   and it works on a Mac very well, but you'd have to put
[01:38:38.480 --> 01:38:40.240]   your software on the Mac.
[01:38:40.240 --> 01:38:41.520]   Yeah, wouldn't that be cool?
[01:38:41.520 --> 01:38:43.160]   Just have a little Bluetooth tripod camera,
[01:38:43.160 --> 01:38:47.640]   and I think the iPad has enough horsepower to do it.
[01:38:47.640 --> 01:38:48.640]   Anyway.
[01:38:48.640 --> 01:38:50.120]   I think the whole thing is great.
[01:38:50.120 --> 01:38:50.760]   I love that guy, too.
[01:38:50.760 --> 01:38:52.400]   Isn't it cool?
[01:38:52.400 --> 01:38:55.600]   It's one of those things where it's a total,
[01:38:55.600 --> 01:38:57.680]   "Live in the Life of James Bond type gadget."
[01:38:57.680 --> 01:39:00.240]   You know what I mean?
[01:39:00.240 --> 01:39:02.080]   Microphone's not great, but boy, the picture
[01:39:02.080 --> 01:39:04.920]   is pretty darn good considering it's going over Bluetooth.
[01:39:04.920 --> 01:39:09.160]   Let's see.
[01:39:09.160 --> 01:39:10.080]   I guess that's it.
[01:39:10.080 --> 01:39:11.680]   We're going to do our picks next, but first,
[01:39:11.680 --> 01:39:14.120]   let's do our Audible pick of the week.
[01:39:14.120 --> 01:39:17.040]   Audible is our sponsor, of course,
[01:39:17.040 --> 01:39:19.080]   has been on the network for a long time.
[01:39:19.080 --> 01:39:20.720]   They do the great audio books.
[01:39:20.720 --> 01:39:24.160]   We've come to love, come to depend on, at least for me,
[01:39:24.160 --> 01:39:25.400]   for my sanity.
[01:39:25.400 --> 01:39:27.760]   If you've got a long commute, yeah, you can listen to podcasts.
[01:39:27.760 --> 01:39:29.360]   Sure, in fact, we hope you do.
[01:39:29.360 --> 01:39:30.520]   But every once in a while, it's nice to get
[01:39:30.520 --> 01:39:32.760]   a little educational material in there,
[01:39:32.760 --> 01:39:35.520]   or maybe just a little escapism.
[01:39:35.520 --> 01:39:39.240]   Audible.com/MacBreak is the place to go to take a look
[01:39:39.240 --> 01:39:44.240]   at the 70,000 books now in the Audible bookstore.
[01:39:44.240 --> 01:39:46.960]   All of them read by wonderful actors
[01:39:46.960 --> 01:39:49.360]   who bring these books to life.
[01:39:49.360 --> 01:39:51.640]   That's what I really enjoy.
[01:39:51.640 --> 01:39:53.280]   And some great choices here.
[01:39:53.280 --> 01:39:54.840]   Every time I go to the Audible page
[01:39:54.840 --> 01:39:56.280]   and I look at the stuff on the front page,
[01:39:56.280 --> 01:39:59.040]   which is the new stuff, I go, "Ooh, I want to listen to that.
[01:39:59.040 --> 01:39:59.880]   "I want to listen to that."
[01:39:59.880 --> 01:40:02.200]   I have the two book a month subscription,
[01:40:02.200 --> 01:40:04.400]   like this one, "Contested Will Who Wrote Shakespeare"
[01:40:04.400 --> 01:40:05.240]   by James Shapiro.
[01:40:05.240 --> 01:40:08.160]   I'd love to know about that.
[01:40:08.160 --> 01:40:09.960]   Robin Williams, who wrote the little Mac book,
[01:40:09.960 --> 01:40:12.640]   has a theory that Shakespeare was a woman.
[01:40:12.640 --> 01:40:15.240]   I'm sure she's included in this.
[01:40:15.240 --> 01:40:21.840]   Audible.com/MacBreak.
[01:40:21.840 --> 01:40:23.160]   Andy, you must have stocked up
[01:40:23.160 --> 01:40:26.080]   before you went to Colorado for the World Affairs Council.
[01:40:26.080 --> 01:40:28.480]   Got anything good on the iPod there?
[01:40:28.480 --> 01:40:31.480]   Yeah, actually, I wanted to recommend,
[01:40:31.480 --> 01:40:33.240]   I think this is one of the books I've recommended
[01:40:33.240 --> 01:40:34.760]   a couple of years before.
[01:40:34.760 --> 01:40:38.600]   I'm a huge, huge fan of Julius Wieni's monologues.
[01:40:38.600 --> 01:40:40.160]   There's three of them that she's done
[01:40:40.160 --> 01:40:42.680]   that have been released on Audible.
[01:40:42.680 --> 01:40:47.480]   And this less of an audio book than a captured performance.
[01:40:47.480 --> 01:40:50.400]   She does these monologues that are just so well planned outs.
[01:40:50.400 --> 01:40:51.920]   They take on such a journey
[01:40:51.920 --> 01:40:55.080]   and they're so engagingly performed
[01:40:55.080 --> 01:40:57.920]   that you're just with her every step of the way.
[01:40:57.920 --> 01:41:01.000]   She's on three autobiographical ones.
[01:41:01.000 --> 01:41:03.960]   The first one was God said Ha about it.
[01:41:03.960 --> 01:41:07.040]   God said Ha, which is sort of a journey
[01:41:07.040 --> 01:41:09.120]   that she was taking where she just had a really bad
[01:41:09.120 --> 01:41:11.360]   couple of years in which her brother got sick
[01:41:11.360 --> 01:41:13.160]   and then she got sick.
[01:41:13.160 --> 01:41:15.160]   And meanwhile, she's making a lot of changes in her life
[01:41:15.160 --> 01:41:16.480]   and her career.
[01:41:16.480 --> 01:41:20.480]   And it's sort of such a relatable and engaging performance.
[01:41:20.480 --> 01:41:23.240]   The next one that I think is the best of the three,
[01:41:23.240 --> 01:41:25.760]   what an achievement she did with this one
[01:41:25.760 --> 01:41:27.720]   is called Letting Go of God
[01:41:27.720 --> 01:41:29.320]   because she was raised, I believe, Catholic.
[01:41:29.320 --> 01:41:34.320]   And this monologue was about her gentle transition
[01:41:34.320 --> 01:41:37.480]   into accepting the fact that she doesn't believe in God
[01:41:37.480 --> 01:41:39.280]   anymore, that it's not working for her
[01:41:39.280 --> 01:41:40.440]   and accepting the fact that
[01:41:40.440 --> 01:41:42.240]   and being able to really be happy with the fact
[01:41:42.240 --> 01:41:43.360]   that she is an atheist.
[01:41:43.360 --> 01:41:49.760]   And your eyes sort of, religious opinions,
[01:41:49.760 --> 01:41:50.920]   a lot like political opinion
[01:41:50.920 --> 01:41:53.360]   that you're instantly sort of bracing yourself
[01:41:53.360 --> 01:41:55.080]   and saying, oh, this is probably gonna be someone
[01:41:55.080 --> 01:41:56.720]   from either extreme of this argument.
[01:41:56.720 --> 01:41:58.080]   There's gonna be a lot of shouting
[01:41:58.080 --> 01:42:00.440]   and a lot of people, and a lot of the other person
[01:42:00.440 --> 01:42:01.960]   who doesn't agree with you is an idiot,
[01:42:01.960 --> 01:42:04.240]   but this is the most powerful
[01:42:04.240 --> 01:42:06.200]   and winning argument I've ever heard.
[01:42:06.200 --> 01:42:08.400]   It just simply walks you not through the argument
[01:42:08.400 --> 01:42:11.160]   against God, but the reason why she herself
[01:42:11.160 --> 01:42:12.680]   came to this decision
[01:42:12.680 --> 01:42:15.160]   and why this was the right decision for her.
[01:42:15.160 --> 01:42:16.840]   The list one is in the family way,
[01:42:16.840 --> 01:42:18.920]   which is another sort of life transition that she made,
[01:42:18.920 --> 01:42:21.560]   which she now is a, since the last one now,
[01:42:21.560 --> 01:42:24.560]   she's a mom, now she's settling down a little bit more.
[01:42:24.560 --> 01:42:27.480]   Recently she moved, I blew to the Chicago area
[01:42:27.480 --> 01:42:30.680]   to not to make a big change of life
[01:42:30.680 --> 01:42:33.360]   because this was just the right decisions for her right away.
[01:42:33.360 --> 01:42:36.400]   And hang on a second.
[01:42:36.400 --> 01:42:40.560]   We'll be right back with this word
[01:42:40.560 --> 01:42:43.000]   after this word from Andy's host.
[01:42:43.000 --> 01:42:43.840]   Sorry about that.
[01:42:43.840 --> 01:42:45.280]   Yes. (laughs)
[01:42:45.280 --> 01:42:47.440]   But yeah, so what's put me back in that mind
[01:42:47.440 --> 01:42:49.040]   is that she's one of the speakers here
[01:42:49.040 --> 01:42:50.160]   at the conference this week.
[01:42:50.160 --> 01:42:51.000]   Oh, neat.
[01:42:51.000 --> 01:42:53.280]   And I got to meet her yesterday
[01:42:53.280 --> 01:42:54.960]   and she is the most, she is the most,
[01:42:54.960 --> 01:42:56.480]   the rightful person ever.
[01:42:56.480 --> 01:43:00.480]   Like the sweetest person I've ever met in my entire life.
[01:43:00.480 --> 01:43:02.920]   And like, I said, I'm like, oh, life is wonderful.
[01:43:02.920 --> 01:43:04.320]   The world is wonderful.
[01:43:04.320 --> 01:43:05.800]   Not because she's saying these things,
[01:43:05.800 --> 01:43:08.360]   but because she's just such a happy person
[01:43:08.360 --> 01:43:10.160]   when she's just talking to you.
[01:43:10.160 --> 01:43:12.480]   And so she was on that list of,
[01:43:12.480 --> 01:43:15.520]   she was on that list of some of these speakers around.
[01:43:15.520 --> 01:43:18.080]   I read the guest list, the speakers list,
[01:43:18.080 --> 01:43:19.840]   and I'm thinking, I've been a huge fan of this person
[01:43:19.840 --> 01:43:20.720]   for many years.
[01:43:20.720 --> 01:43:23.760]   Andy, it is vitally important you not behave like a dork
[01:43:23.760 --> 01:43:25.440]   when you need this person.
[01:43:25.440 --> 01:43:28.120]   I said, if you all, if what you have to do is say, hello,
[01:43:28.120 --> 01:43:29.240]   very pleasant to meet you.
[01:43:29.240 --> 01:43:30.080]   Oh, what was that you said?
[01:43:30.080 --> 01:43:31.760]   Oh, you're a monologist.
[01:43:31.760 --> 01:43:32.760]   You're a monologist.
[01:43:32.760 --> 01:43:33.760]   That's easy for you to say.
[01:43:33.760 --> 01:43:35.120]   Very nice to meet you.
[01:43:35.120 --> 01:43:36.760]   Well, that was the buffet is.
[01:43:36.760 --> 01:43:39.720]   It's okay to say I'm a big fan of your work, Andy.
[01:43:39.720 --> 01:43:41.640]   Take it for me as a super celebrity.
[01:43:41.640 --> 01:43:42.480]   I know.
[01:43:42.480 --> 01:43:43.320]   It's okay to do that.
[01:43:43.320 --> 01:43:44.160]   I know.
[01:43:44.160 --> 01:43:46.120]   Well, see, the other one I was hoping to meet
[01:43:46.120 --> 01:43:47.640]   was Werner Herzog.
[01:43:47.640 --> 01:43:50.160]   And I actually shared a car ride with him last night.
[01:43:50.160 --> 01:43:51.480]   Wow.
[01:43:51.480 --> 01:43:54.560]   And so, having been a hoe's dog is talking to me
[01:43:54.560 --> 01:43:56.960]   and saying, so how did you catch video?
[01:43:56.960 --> 01:43:58.440]   You are.
[01:43:58.440 --> 01:44:01.640]   And it feels like you're being your interview
[01:44:01.640 --> 01:44:03.080]   of a movie being interviewed by someone who
[01:44:03.080 --> 01:44:04.840]   decides where you go next in life.
[01:44:04.840 --> 01:44:05.960]   That's so awesome.
[01:44:05.960 --> 01:44:07.200]   Yeah, that's great.
[01:44:07.200 --> 01:44:08.400]   You'll be poetry.
[01:44:08.400 --> 01:44:09.080]   Yeah.
[01:44:09.080 --> 01:44:10.080]   Yeah.
[01:44:10.080 --> 01:44:12.360]   But anyway, so these are just great audiobooks.
[01:44:12.360 --> 01:44:15.200]   The only disadvantage in the only reason why I don't always
[01:44:15.200 --> 01:44:18.720]   recommend them is that some of these audiobooks are 10,
[01:44:18.720 --> 01:44:19.920]   20, 30 hours long.
[01:44:19.920 --> 01:44:21.560]   And I'm a big favor of sticking it to the man
[01:44:21.560 --> 01:44:22.760]   whenever possible.
[01:44:22.760 --> 01:44:25.360]   Her monologues are stage performances that go for like an hour
[01:44:25.360 --> 01:44:26.640]   and a half, two hours.
[01:44:26.640 --> 01:44:29.480]   So you're not getting the most minutes per dollar there.
[01:44:29.480 --> 01:44:32.000]   But in terms of entertainment, I think they're the best titles
[01:44:32.000 --> 01:44:34.400]   that are some of the best titles that are out there in Audible.
[01:44:34.400 --> 01:44:35.720]   I don't think it's a bad idea.
[01:44:35.720 --> 01:44:37.880]   I think the first time you get an audiobook,
[01:44:37.880 --> 01:44:40.840]   it's probably a good idea to get something that you just know
[01:44:40.840 --> 01:44:43.920]   you're going to enjoy because it takes a little while
[01:44:43.920 --> 01:44:46.920]   to get the rhythm of listening instead of reading.
[01:44:46.920 --> 01:44:49.760]   And so I think this is a great way to kind of ease your way
[01:44:49.760 --> 01:44:50.120]   into it.
[01:44:50.120 --> 01:44:51.320]   The point is you get one free.
[01:44:51.320 --> 01:44:53.680]   You go and try Julia Sweeney.
[01:44:53.680 --> 01:44:56.600]   God said, ha, letting go of God.
[01:44:56.600 --> 01:44:59.600]   Or the third in the trilogy, God made me pregnant.
[01:44:59.600 --> 01:45:00.200]   No, I'm sorry.
[01:45:00.200 --> 01:45:03.800]   In a family way, I think is what is called.
[01:45:03.800 --> 01:45:07.800]   Audible.com/MacBreak.
[01:45:07.800 --> 01:45:10.880]   That is the site to go to get your first book free.
[01:45:10.880 --> 01:45:17.080]   And please forgive the inappropriate--
[01:45:17.080 --> 01:45:18.000]   what would you call it?
[01:45:18.000 --> 01:45:21.800]   Erizy?
[01:45:21.800 --> 01:45:22.960]   Is there appropriate?
[01:45:22.960 --> 01:45:24.120]   No, there isn't.
[01:45:24.120 --> 01:45:27.000]   I think it's kind of sacrilege.
[01:45:27.000 --> 01:45:28.480]   That was the word I was looking for.
[01:45:28.480 --> 01:45:29.680]   Please forgive the sacrilege.
[01:45:29.680 --> 01:45:32.320]   Audible has in no way, in any way, at all.
[01:45:32.320 --> 01:45:33.720]   Has anything to do with it.
[01:45:33.720 --> 01:45:37.240]   Audible.com/MacBreak.
[01:45:37.240 --> 01:45:38.200]   Now, let us move on.
[01:45:38.200 --> 01:45:40.440]   It's time for it.
[01:45:40.440 --> 01:45:41.880]   Audible's going, why?
[01:45:41.880 --> 01:45:42.400]   Why?
[01:45:42.400 --> 01:45:45.520]   Why does he do that to me?
[01:45:45.520 --> 01:45:48.320]   I was just looking at Street View on the iPad,
[01:45:48.320 --> 01:45:50.160]   because the maps application that you do to the street.
[01:45:50.160 --> 01:45:51.840]   You're not really cool.
[01:45:51.840 --> 01:45:54.440]   Like I could for the first time, like see inside the building
[01:45:54.440 --> 01:45:54.960]   and everything.
[01:45:54.960 --> 01:45:56.800]   It's really Nito.
[01:45:56.800 --> 01:45:57.880]   It's stunning.
[01:45:57.880 --> 01:46:00.400]   That was one of the first things we did when we looked at.
[01:46:00.400 --> 01:46:02.000]   Someone pulled it up, and it was just--
[01:46:02.000 --> 01:46:03.640]   it looks unbelievably great.
[01:46:03.640 --> 01:46:06.520]   Yeah, I want to walk down the street with it.
[01:46:06.520 --> 01:46:07.880]   Neat.
[01:46:07.880 --> 01:46:08.640]   All right, let's get a--
[01:46:08.640 --> 01:46:10.400]   I'll be like the GPS person comes out.
[01:46:10.400 --> 01:46:11.600]   Yeah, imagine.
[01:46:11.600 --> 01:46:13.880]   Well, you know, I'm surprised this does pretty good geolocation
[01:46:13.880 --> 01:46:15.080]   by a Wi-Fi.
[01:46:15.080 --> 01:46:17.880]   They're pretty accurate, at least everywhere I go.
[01:46:17.880 --> 01:46:19.800]   The whole Maps app is really, really great.
[01:46:19.800 --> 01:46:22.880]   It's one of the best apps on the system.
[01:46:22.880 --> 01:46:24.920]   It was so funny when Steve showed it at the event,
[01:46:24.920 --> 01:46:27.080]   because he never mentioned it's Google.
[01:46:27.080 --> 01:46:28.280]   No.
[01:46:28.280 --> 01:46:30.960]   He left that part out.
[01:46:30.960 --> 01:46:35.080]   We've done a great Maps app for it.
[01:46:35.080 --> 01:46:37.880]   Let's get our pick of the week, starting with the upper left
[01:46:37.880 --> 01:46:40.680]   corner to block, Mr. Alex Lindsey.
[01:46:40.680 --> 01:46:44.040]   So, you know, there's so many.
[01:46:44.040 --> 01:46:44.520]   I know.
[01:46:44.520 --> 01:46:47.400]   So many iPad apps that you want to talk about.
[01:46:47.400 --> 01:46:48.920]   So I'm trying to find one that--
[01:46:48.920 --> 01:46:50.720]   I want to do one that I think is a little bit original,
[01:46:50.720 --> 01:46:54.560]   someone else might not pick up immediately, which is--
[01:46:54.560 --> 01:46:59.320]   generally, I find that they're fun apps, but they're not.
[01:46:59.320 --> 01:47:01.960]   That useful, but there's always something about them.
[01:47:01.960 --> 01:47:03.800]   So, Smulely?
[01:47:03.800 --> 01:47:04.320]   Smule.
[01:47:04.320 --> 01:47:04.880]   Just Smule.
[01:47:04.880 --> 01:47:06.080]   Smule.
[01:47:06.080 --> 01:47:07.280]   Has Magic Piano?
[01:47:07.280 --> 01:47:10.040]   Have you guys played with the Magic Piano yet?
[01:47:10.040 --> 01:47:11.760]   The--
[01:47:11.760 --> 01:47:12.800]   I'll play with it right now.
[01:47:12.800 --> 01:47:16.520]   I'll accompany you while you speak.
[01:47:16.520 --> 01:47:17.440]   But it's random.
[01:47:17.440 --> 01:47:20.320]   But the thing about-- here's the thing that they've changed
[01:47:20.320 --> 01:47:23.520]   is that you have this current location.
[01:47:23.520 --> 01:47:26.280]   And so, number one, you can play these great little songs.
[01:47:26.280 --> 01:47:28.520]   And it's the way that they've set it up to teach you
[01:47:28.520 --> 01:47:31.440]   to play their little thing is great.
[01:47:31.440 --> 01:47:32.600]   There's a song book.
[01:47:32.600 --> 01:47:34.800]   So I do the song book, right?
[01:47:34.800 --> 01:47:36.120]   And you can play little songs.
[01:47:36.120 --> 01:47:38.240]   And it's just all you do is kind of like paint by numbers
[01:47:38.240 --> 01:47:40.600]   and you're playing classical.
[01:47:40.600 --> 01:47:42.840]   And are you playing it now?
[01:47:42.840 --> 01:47:47.320]   And so the thing--
[01:47:47.320 --> 01:47:48.920]   I didn't even know I could play that.
[01:47:48.920 --> 01:47:49.440]   I know.
[01:47:49.440 --> 01:47:50.840]   And it sounds fun when you do it.
[01:47:50.840 --> 01:47:52.920]   But here's the thing is they have one in the menu
[01:47:52.920 --> 01:47:54.520]   you'll see Duet.
[01:47:54.520 --> 01:47:55.280]   Yeah.
[01:47:55.280 --> 01:47:56.280]   How do I do that?
[01:47:56.280 --> 01:47:57.120]   And it do Duet.
[01:47:57.120 --> 01:48:01.320]   And it literally connects you to somebody else in the world
[01:48:01.320 --> 01:48:03.000]   who's playing.
[01:48:03.000 --> 01:48:04.960]   All right, I'm going to just put in my name Leo.
[01:48:04.960 --> 01:48:06.240]   It's finding a Duet partner.
[01:48:06.240 --> 01:48:08.400]   Boy, they're going to be sorry.
[01:48:08.400 --> 01:48:09.720]   Chris, Chris, you're a keyboardist.
[01:48:09.720 --> 01:48:12.320]   I mean, can you actually play this as like a keyboard?
[01:48:12.320 --> 01:48:13.320]   Well, yeah.
[01:48:13.320 --> 01:48:14.080]   That's sort of--
[01:48:14.080 --> 01:48:16.800]   I mean, the whole idea is kind of all Smule's things
[01:48:16.800 --> 01:48:17.880]   are that non-keyboard play.
[01:48:17.880 --> 01:48:20.640]   And any art, non-musicians can play them and make music.
[01:48:20.640 --> 01:48:21.760]   So I'm connected to somebody.
[01:48:21.760 --> 01:48:23.080]   There were some people that were playing it
[01:48:23.080 --> 01:48:24.520]   that were very good.
[01:48:24.520 --> 01:48:25.160]   I'm connected.
[01:48:25.160 --> 01:48:27.320]   I was like, they were really playing music on it.
[01:48:27.320 --> 01:48:28.880]   Like music that I recognize.
[01:48:28.880 --> 01:48:32.880]   A lot of time with these Smule, a lot of these are--
[01:48:32.880 --> 01:48:34.960]   it's just random stuff that sounds good.
[01:48:34.960 --> 01:48:36.720]   And what happens is you get on this Duet
[01:48:36.720 --> 01:48:37.920]   and it automatically like--
[01:48:37.920 --> 01:48:39.600]   you know, it gives you somebody and then you
[01:48:39.600 --> 01:48:41.440]   can keep on choosing somebody new.
[01:48:41.440 --> 01:48:44.320]   And some people, I literally just chose someone new
[01:48:44.320 --> 01:48:46.320]   because they were so good I knew I'd annoy them.
[01:48:46.320 --> 01:48:47.720]   You know, because I was just kind of--
[01:48:47.720 --> 01:48:48.920]   there were a couple of people.
[01:48:48.920 --> 01:48:50.200]   But there's this weird thing.
[01:48:50.200 --> 01:48:51.800]   It's like the next step of their apps
[01:48:51.800 --> 01:48:54.360]   where you could see someone else in the world playing.
[01:48:54.360 --> 01:48:56.760]   Now you're like, you're actually interacting with them.
[01:48:56.760 --> 01:48:58.800]   Well, they'll play something and then you play something back
[01:48:58.800 --> 01:49:00.640]   and then they play something and you play something back
[01:49:00.640 --> 01:49:01.640]   where you try to play together.
[01:49:01.640 --> 01:49:04.640]   And it was something about it that was, to me, magical.
[01:49:04.640 --> 01:49:05.720]   But you were--
[01:49:05.720 --> 01:49:09.520]   I just became transfixed on this thing for a little while,
[01:49:09.520 --> 01:49:11.440]   like playing with different people all over the world.
[01:49:11.440 --> 01:49:12.920]   I thought that there's something about--
[01:49:12.920 --> 01:49:15.920]   The chat roulette for music, he's just nexted me.
[01:49:15.920 --> 01:49:18.360]   And my heart is broken.
[01:49:18.360 --> 01:49:19.080]   Chat Duet.
[01:49:19.080 --> 01:49:21.640]   So the way it works, if you tap a higher up,
[01:49:21.640 --> 01:49:22.840]   it's a higher note, right?
[01:49:22.840 --> 01:49:24.560]   But you can do arpeggios.
[01:49:24.560 --> 01:49:26.320]   Well, you can also set--
[01:49:26.320 --> 01:49:28.720]   you can set the magic piano to be different styles.
[01:49:28.720 --> 01:49:30.400]   So if you hit the little piano button,
[01:49:30.400 --> 01:49:31.560]   it'll change the style.
[01:49:31.560 --> 01:49:33.080]   So it's one of the spurl.
[01:49:33.080 --> 01:49:35.360]   The one that's most useful that if you knew how to play,
[01:49:35.360 --> 01:49:36.360]   I don't know how to play.
[01:49:36.360 --> 01:49:37.360]   It looks like an actual circle.
[01:49:37.360 --> 01:49:38.360]   Yeah, it's like a circle.
[01:49:38.360 --> 01:49:39.360]   It's like a circle.
[01:49:39.360 --> 01:49:40.360]   Right.
[01:49:40.360 --> 01:49:41.360]   And then there is the one--
[01:49:41.360 --> 01:49:42.360]   So Chris, bring-- I mean, you're a keyboardist.
[01:49:42.360 --> 01:49:43.360]   Can you play this?
[01:49:43.360 --> 01:49:48.240]   It's not the way I'm accustomed to playing an instrument.
[01:49:48.240 --> 01:49:51.120]   So it's fun to play with.
[01:49:51.120 --> 01:49:53.160]   And I think you can do some musical things with it.
[01:49:53.160 --> 01:49:54.960]   But if you're a traditional musician,
[01:49:54.960 --> 01:49:56.600]   it's going to be a little challenging.
[01:49:56.600 --> 01:49:57.800]   It's a little annoying, probably.
[01:49:57.800 --> 01:49:59.000]   But I definitely-- there were definitely
[01:49:59.000 --> 01:50:00.720]   people who were traditional magicians who had figured out
[01:50:00.720 --> 01:50:01.920]   how to play that thing very well.
[01:50:01.920 --> 01:50:03.800]   Like, I was just-- I couldn't believe what was coming out
[01:50:03.800 --> 01:50:05.160]   from on the duets.
[01:50:05.160 --> 01:50:06.520]   And then the assignment I just tried to keep up with,
[01:50:06.520 --> 01:50:07.520]   and the nages went, you know what?
[01:50:07.520 --> 01:50:09.320]   I'm going to go with somebody else, because you suck.
[01:50:09.320 --> 01:50:09.840]   You suck.
[01:50:09.840 --> 01:50:13.240]   Yeah, I'm playing with Gary right now in Canada.
[01:50:13.240 --> 01:50:14.160]   How do you get one of these?
[01:50:14.160 --> 01:50:16.560]   Are they selling them in Canada?
[01:50:16.560 --> 01:50:18.360]   Um, hmm.
[01:50:18.360 --> 01:50:20.600]   You throw them over the border.
[01:50:20.600 --> 01:50:22.520]   How did they get them somewhere else?
[01:50:22.520 --> 01:50:23.000]   Hmm.
[01:50:23.000 --> 01:50:24.480]   Well, we're sending one to the other point.
[01:50:24.480 --> 01:50:27.440]   [INAUDIBLE]
[01:50:27.440 --> 01:50:28.440]   Oh, no.
[01:50:28.440 --> 01:50:29.960]   Oh, now I'm talking to Trey.
[01:50:29.960 --> 01:50:31.240]   Hey, Trey.
[01:50:31.240 --> 01:50:32.240]   Hey, Trey.
[01:50:32.240 --> 01:50:35.520]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:50:35.520 --> 01:50:38.160]   Trey knows what he's doing.
[01:50:38.160 --> 01:50:41.480]   I wonder if this is Trey in Austin.
[01:50:41.480 --> 01:50:44.480]   He's playing the Star Wars theme.
[01:50:44.480 --> 01:50:45.880]   That's just for you, Alex.
[01:50:45.880 --> 01:50:47.840]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:50:47.840 --> 01:50:51.320]   OK, let's find out how good the reach of this podcast is.
[01:50:51.320 --> 01:50:54.160]   Next one, I'd like to hear Louis Louis.
[01:50:54.160 --> 01:50:55.400]   Well, this guy says hi, Leo.
[01:50:55.400 --> 01:50:56.240]   So he knows.
[01:50:56.240 --> 01:50:57.360]   He's found me somehow.
[01:50:57.360 --> 01:50:59.440]   And he's-- OK, well, ask him to play Louis Louis.
[01:50:59.440 --> 01:51:02.080]   Can you play Louis Louis Trey?
[01:51:02.080 --> 01:51:03.720]   He's going to be like a 20-second delay of us getting
[01:51:03.720 --> 01:51:05.360]   to him for him to hear us say it.
[01:51:05.360 --> 01:51:07.360]   He's playing Star Wars, which is really wild.
[01:51:07.360 --> 01:51:11.720]   Now he's playing the Death Star March.
[01:51:11.720 --> 01:51:13.720]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:51:13.720 --> 01:51:18.800]   No, no, that's Hart and Saul.
[01:51:18.800 --> 01:51:21.120]   No, no, Louis Louis.
[01:51:21.120 --> 01:51:22.920]   But he's playing that on that little--
[01:51:22.920 --> 01:51:24.960]   That's a circular keyboard.
[01:51:24.960 --> 01:51:28.280]   Hart and Saul.
[01:51:28.280 --> 01:51:29.720]   Maybe he'll come on.
[01:51:29.720 --> 01:51:31.640]   So I don't know if this is the same tray that
[01:51:31.640 --> 01:51:34.280]   is in Austin who does the great HDR stuff.
[01:51:34.280 --> 01:51:36.480]   But he sent us some amazing--
[01:51:36.480 --> 01:51:38.120]   if you go to stuckincustoms.com,
[01:51:38.120 --> 01:51:41.600]   he's got some beautiful iPad wallpaper.
[01:51:41.600 --> 01:51:43.600]   Would you like to continue to play duvet mode?
[01:51:43.600 --> 01:51:45.320]   I guess yes, I would.
[01:51:45.320 --> 01:51:47.240]   Now it's finding a new partner for me.
[01:51:47.240 --> 01:51:48.080]   So that's pretty cool.
[01:51:48.080 --> 01:51:51.240]   So that's, Mule, how much is that?
[01:51:51.240 --> 01:51:52.840]   Magic piano, it's not much.
[01:51:52.840 --> 01:51:53.560]   Five bucks a month.
[01:51:53.560 --> 01:51:54.760]   It's less than $10.
[01:51:54.760 --> 01:51:58.720]   I mean, it was like $2.99 or $9.99 or something like that.
[01:51:58.720 --> 01:52:01.080]   But it was-- it's a great little-- it's a great--
[01:52:01.080 --> 01:52:02.720]   and it's not so much--
[01:52:02.720 --> 01:52:04.880]   I just felt like it really showed this kind of interesting
[01:52:04.880 --> 01:52:07.400]   window that's starting to kind of start to build up.
[01:52:07.400 --> 01:52:09.880]   They've been really pioneering.
[01:52:09.880 --> 01:52:11.800]   I got to talk to one of the developers at dinner.
[01:52:11.800 --> 01:52:14.440]   And they really get that that world view
[01:52:14.440 --> 01:52:17.600]   is a big segment of their location.
[01:52:17.600 --> 01:52:18.080]   Oh, yeah.
[01:52:18.080 --> 01:52:19.760]   Well, it's funny, Kyle, because it's iPad.
[01:52:19.760 --> 01:52:21.160]   So you only see the US.
[01:52:21.160 --> 01:52:23.600]   We're not going all over the place yet, you know.
[01:52:23.600 --> 01:52:24.880]   But I'm sure we will soon.
[01:52:24.880 --> 01:52:28.280]   Smules magic piano.
[01:52:28.280 --> 01:52:30.120]   Mr. Chris Breen, what do you like?
[01:52:30.120 --> 01:52:33.360]   Chris, of course, writes those great iPod books.
[01:52:33.360 --> 01:52:36.640]   So he's very focused on iPod content.
[01:52:36.640 --> 01:52:38.000]   I am, but unfortunately, I'm going
[01:52:38.000 --> 01:52:39.240]   to be a contrarian today.
[01:52:39.240 --> 01:52:40.440]   All right.
[01:52:40.440 --> 01:52:43.760]   I needed to get my iPad back for my daughter.
[01:52:43.760 --> 01:52:44.960]   And she wouldn't give it to me.
[01:52:44.960 --> 01:52:48.400]   So I had to find something else that I could lure her to.
[01:52:48.400 --> 01:52:50.280]   So I could get my iPad back.
[01:52:50.280 --> 01:52:54.800]   And the recent luring is I am-- stop motion animation.
[01:52:54.800 --> 01:52:56.040]   Oh, fun.
[01:52:56.040 --> 01:52:58.040]   And she really, really likes it.
[01:52:58.040 --> 01:53:00.480]   And I've been checking out for an article that I wrote.
[01:53:00.480 --> 01:53:02.160]   And I've looked at a couple of programs.
[01:53:02.160 --> 01:53:03.880]   And the one that we've been using lately
[01:53:03.880 --> 01:53:06.520]   is called Dragon Stop Motion.
[01:53:06.520 --> 01:53:08.840]   It's from DZ software.
[01:53:08.840 --> 01:53:10.120]   It's $275.
[01:53:10.120 --> 01:53:12.400]   So this is high-end, pro-losing--
[01:53:12.400 --> 01:53:14.440]   That's the pro application.
[01:53:14.440 --> 01:53:15.920]   Yeah, it's a pro application.
[01:53:15.920 --> 01:53:18.520]   They send you this USB controller.
[01:53:18.520 --> 01:53:22.240]   You plug in and you control your video camera
[01:53:22.240 --> 01:53:23.400]   that you've plugged into your Mac.
[01:53:23.400 --> 01:53:25.960]   Also, it will support DSLR cameras.
[01:53:25.960 --> 01:53:27.240]   Oh, I was going to ask.
[01:53:27.240 --> 01:53:28.640]   If you could do this with a 5D, you
[01:53:28.640 --> 01:53:30.840]   could do super high-res stuff.
[01:53:30.840 --> 01:53:32.080]   I'm a Nikon shooter.
[01:53:32.080 --> 01:53:33.880]   And I use it with ID300.
[01:53:33.880 --> 01:53:36.320]   And it works really, really well.
[01:53:36.320 --> 01:53:37.640]   Oh, this is neat.
[01:53:37.640 --> 01:53:40.040]   So they do onion skinning.
[01:53:40.040 --> 01:53:42.880]   There are-- you can do time-lapse.
[01:53:42.880 --> 01:53:45.000]   There's an audio track for it.
[01:53:45.000 --> 01:53:49.400]   It also has a X-sheet so that you can create a technical script
[01:53:49.400 --> 01:53:50.240]   as you're doing it.
[01:53:50.240 --> 01:53:54.720]   Again, if you wanted to use stop motion for at home,
[01:53:54.720 --> 01:53:57.120]   you'd use something like, boy, I stop motion.
[01:53:57.120 --> 01:53:57.620]   Right.
[01:53:57.620 --> 01:53:59.240]   The $49 edition.
[01:53:59.240 --> 01:54:02.160]   But if you want to do more stuff and more professional stuff,
[01:54:02.160 --> 01:54:05.160]   this Dragon stop motion is really, really good.
[01:54:05.160 --> 01:54:09.440]   And I stop motion comes in a professional flavor,
[01:54:09.440 --> 01:54:10.840]   but it's almost $500.
[01:54:10.840 --> 01:54:13.280]   So at $275, this is a bargain.
[01:54:13.280 --> 01:54:14.920]   You get the hardware controller.
[01:54:14.920 --> 01:54:17.320]   And you can do some really, really great stuff.
[01:54:17.320 --> 01:54:20.160]   And best of all, if your kids got your iPad--
[01:54:20.160 --> 01:54:21.200]   I didn't get it back.
[01:54:21.200 --> 01:54:23.320]   You can say, oh, look over here.
[01:54:23.320 --> 01:54:25.760]   What's attached to my MacBook Pro?
[01:54:25.760 --> 01:54:28.240]   And I just happen to have a lot of clay here
[01:54:28.240 --> 01:54:30.760]   and several gumbi figures and knock yourself out.
[01:54:30.760 --> 01:54:32.120]   And then you get your iPad back.
[01:54:32.120 --> 01:54:34.480]   You could make the Fantastic Mr. Fox with this thing.
[01:54:34.480 --> 01:54:35.240]   This is pretty amazing.
[01:54:35.240 --> 01:54:36.240]   Oh, yeah.
[01:54:36.240 --> 01:54:38.840]   Alex, have you ever used this?
[01:54:38.840 --> 01:54:41.600]   Yeah, actually, I think I recommended an earlier version
[01:54:41.600 --> 01:54:44.280]   of it on Macbreak maybe two years ago or something
[01:54:44.280 --> 01:54:45.160]   or a year and a half ago.
[01:54:45.160 --> 01:54:48.240]   And it was one of those things that my son--
[01:54:48.240 --> 01:54:49.600]   same story.
[01:54:49.600 --> 01:54:52.320]   My son was really getting into stop motion.
[01:54:52.320 --> 01:54:54.880]   I was really looking at what the next step is.
[01:54:54.880 --> 01:54:57.600]   And of course, that's not the next step.
[01:54:57.600 --> 01:54:58.920]   That's the final step.
[01:54:58.920 --> 01:55:00.920]   That is really--
[01:55:00.920 --> 01:55:02.720]   I mean, this is what they use in studios.
[01:55:02.720 --> 01:55:05.360]   I mean, this is not a little game anymore.
[01:55:05.360 --> 01:55:08.640]   It really is the full tool set that you
[01:55:08.640 --> 01:55:10.720]   need to create a stop motion film.
[01:55:10.720 --> 01:55:13.800]   And if you shot it with a 5D, you'd be doing gorgeous.
[01:55:13.800 --> 01:55:16.920]   You'd be doing more than film quality.
[01:55:16.920 --> 01:55:17.760]   I mean, a movie quality.
[01:55:17.760 --> 01:55:19.560]   Well, if you shot it with a Rebel.
[01:55:19.560 --> 01:55:21.320]   Yeah, even a Rebel you would be.
[01:55:21.320 --> 01:55:21.840]   Yeah.
[01:55:21.840 --> 01:55:23.280]   It's very, very--
[01:55:23.280 --> 01:55:25.760]   it's a really, really great application, really well
[01:55:25.760 --> 01:55:26.200]   implemented.
[01:55:26.200 --> 01:55:28.560]   And it's built by guys who are doing this stuff.
[01:55:28.560 --> 01:55:33.640]   And I couldn't recommend it any better or more than Chris
[01:55:33.640 --> 01:55:33.960]   does.
[01:55:33.960 --> 01:55:34.480]   It's fantastic.
[01:55:34.480 --> 01:55:35.840]   That's really neat.
[01:55:35.840 --> 01:55:36.400]   Thank you, Chris.
[01:55:36.400 --> 01:55:37.400]   Great recommendation.
[01:55:37.400 --> 01:55:40.960]   That is from dragonstopmotion.com.
[01:55:40.960 --> 01:55:42.200]   There is a try before you buy.
[01:55:42.200 --> 01:55:44.040]   So you don't have to spend the $2.75.
[01:55:44.040 --> 01:55:48.200]   Although if it's this professional, that's a great price.
[01:55:48.200 --> 01:55:48.680]   Yeah.
[01:55:48.680 --> 01:55:50.600]   John Gruber, you want to make a recommendation?
[01:55:50.600 --> 01:55:53.000]   Something you like these days you've been playing with?
[01:55:53.000 --> 01:55:54.040]   So hard to pick.
[01:55:54.040 --> 01:56:00.360]   But I'm going to pick Net Newswire for the iPad, which--
[01:56:00.360 --> 01:56:04.120]   and Net Newswire didn't start life as a Google reader
[01:56:04.120 --> 01:56:06.680]   client for RSS reads feeds.
[01:56:06.680 --> 01:56:08.840]   But that's what it uses now for syncing.
[01:56:08.840 --> 01:56:09.920]   And it works great.
[01:56:09.920 --> 01:56:12.800]   So it syncs between any other places
[01:56:12.800 --> 01:56:17.400]   where you read your Google reader feeds.
[01:56:17.400 --> 01:56:18.400]   And I love it.
[01:56:18.400 --> 01:56:19.560]   You've got it right there, right?
[01:56:19.560 --> 01:56:21.440]   I love it on the iPad.
[01:56:21.440 --> 01:56:26.120]   And it uses fundamentally the same layout as the Mail app,
[01:56:26.120 --> 01:56:29.840]   where you've got this split view with your sources on the left
[01:56:29.840 --> 01:56:30.880]   in a narrow column.
[01:56:30.880 --> 01:56:34.320]   And then pretty much-- maybe it's a perfect square on the right.
[01:56:34.320 --> 01:56:35.280]   Looks like it, yeah.
[01:56:35.280 --> 01:56:36.400]   Where you read the feed content.
[01:56:36.400 --> 01:56:38.920]   But where it really, really is just great
[01:56:38.920 --> 01:56:43.360]   is you're reading a link log, like Kotki or something like that.
[01:56:43.360 --> 01:56:45.400]   It's what he's linking to that's most important.
[01:56:45.400 --> 01:56:46.880]   And it doesn't take you out of the app.
[01:56:46.880 --> 01:56:48.640]   It just loads the web page right there.
[01:56:48.640 --> 01:56:51.880]   And that square 2/3 of the screen over there
[01:56:51.880 --> 01:56:55.800]   is just the perfect size for reading.
[01:56:55.800 --> 01:57:01.080]   So I would say the only time I use net news wire in portrait
[01:57:01.080 --> 01:57:04.560]   mode is when I accidentally hold the iPad in portrait mode.
[01:57:04.560 --> 01:57:06.760]   For me, it's a landscape app.
[01:57:06.760 --> 01:57:08.400]   Because I want that thing over there.
[01:57:08.400 --> 01:57:11.080]   It's just a great way to go through feeds.
[01:57:11.080 --> 01:57:17.120]   Because you're not going back and forth.
[01:57:17.120 --> 01:57:19.160]   The thing I hate, I want mail.
[01:57:19.160 --> 01:57:22.880]   The more I use this, I want mail on the iPad
[01:57:22.880 --> 01:57:25.360]   to load web pages in place.
[01:57:25.360 --> 01:57:28.600]   Because it's that switching where somebody sends me a link
[01:57:28.600 --> 01:57:29.960]   in my email, and I tap it.
[01:57:29.960 --> 01:57:32.440]   And now I'm out of mail, and I'm in Safari,
[01:57:32.440 --> 01:57:33.800]   and I'm waiting for the thing to load.
[01:57:33.800 --> 01:57:35.600]   And then I want to go back to mail.
[01:57:35.600 --> 01:57:38.800]   With net news wire, it's just read, read, read, scroll,
[01:57:38.800 --> 01:57:40.560]   scroll, next, next.
[01:57:40.560 --> 01:57:44.160]   There's a-- right in the top right corner, it's just next.
[01:57:44.160 --> 01:57:47.640]   It's just a magic button that shows you the next unread item
[01:57:47.640 --> 01:57:51.360]   in your feeds, whether it's in this feed or another feed.
[01:57:51.360 --> 01:57:53.000]   And it just works great.
[01:57:53.000 --> 01:57:55.520]   I absolutely--
[01:57:55.520 --> 01:57:58.280]   I mean, I would buy an iPad that only had this app on it.
[01:57:58.280 --> 01:57:59.760]   Is it free?
[01:57:59.760 --> 01:58:00.880]   No, it is not free.
[01:58:00.880 --> 01:58:02.160]   It is $10.
[01:58:02.160 --> 01:58:04.400]   And it is going to-- they actually
[01:58:04.400 --> 01:58:06.280]   have a new website for net news wire.
[01:58:06.280 --> 01:58:09.600]   It's netnewswireapp.com.
[01:58:09.600 --> 01:58:11.200]   And I think they announced this.
[01:58:11.200 --> 01:58:15.400]   That it's going to be $15 in May.
[01:58:15.400 --> 01:58:16.160]   So buy now.
[01:58:16.160 --> 01:58:18.240]   So if you're going to buy it, buy it in April.
[01:58:18.240 --> 01:58:19.120]   Yeah.
[01:58:19.120 --> 01:58:20.400]   Yeah, I bought it, of course, immediately.
[01:58:20.400 --> 01:58:21.600]   I'm a net news wire user.
[01:58:21.600 --> 01:58:25.840]   And until there's a Google Reader or a version for the iPad,
[01:58:25.840 --> 01:58:27.480]   this is definitely the way--
[01:58:27.480 --> 01:58:29.320]   I'm not sure how it could be much better.
[01:58:29.320 --> 01:58:29.760]   I mean, that's famous--
[01:58:29.760 --> 01:58:30.640]   I could tell you one way.
[01:58:30.640 --> 01:58:31.480]   Sounds like you've got to put--
[01:58:31.480 --> 01:58:32.840]   Sounds like you've got to put somebody make a--
[01:58:32.840 --> 01:58:34.160]   Sounds like you've got to pipeline them.
[01:58:34.160 --> 01:58:36.360]   There's one thing I'd really like is delicious integration.
[01:58:36.360 --> 01:58:38.680]   It's integrated into the desktop application.
[01:58:38.680 --> 01:58:42.440]   Because the one thing that I do all the time that I can't do--
[01:58:42.440 --> 01:58:44.440]   I haven't figured out how to do on the iPad yet--
[01:58:44.440 --> 01:58:46.960]   is read new stuff and bookmark it for these show
[01:58:46.960 --> 01:58:48.040]   and other shows that we do.
[01:58:48.040 --> 01:58:49.560]   I just want to be able to get to delicious.
[01:58:49.560 --> 01:58:51.680]   Or it doesn't have to be delicious, somewhere.
[01:58:51.680 --> 01:58:52.400]   Oh, you know what?
[01:58:52.400 --> 01:58:54.160]   You should sign up for sign up for Instapaper,
[01:58:54.160 --> 01:58:55.840]   because it has sent to Instapaper.
[01:58:55.840 --> 01:58:57.240]   I do use Instapaper, but I can't--
[01:58:57.240 --> 01:59:00.800]   Well, can I share that with somebody else?
[01:59:00.800 --> 01:59:01.320]   No, I don't know.
[01:59:01.320 --> 01:59:03.640]   See, that's the problem is I need to get bookmarks
[01:59:03.640 --> 01:59:05.400]   into a place where everybody who's on the show--
[01:59:05.400 --> 01:59:06.400]   Yeah, like a show.
[01:59:06.400 --> 01:59:06.920]   Yep.
[01:59:06.920 --> 01:59:09.200]   And by the way, that was going to be my recommendation is--
[01:59:09.200 --> 01:59:09.960]   I have a couple.
[01:59:09.960 --> 01:59:12.680]   I love Instapaper, and there's an iPad version of it,
[01:59:12.680 --> 01:59:14.240]   but 99.
[01:59:14.240 --> 01:59:15.040]   It's fantastic.
[01:59:15.040 --> 01:59:19.200]   I've been using Instapaper to send materials to my Kindle.
[01:59:19.200 --> 01:59:21.040]   And now I don't have to do that.
[01:59:21.040 --> 01:59:23.040]   I can just pull it up right here on the iPad.
[01:59:23.040 --> 01:59:23.840]   It's great.
[01:59:23.840 --> 01:59:26.840]   And I do have Net Newswire, but as I mentioned earlier,
[01:59:26.840 --> 01:59:29.600]   I've been using Early Edition as well, which gives you
[01:59:29.600 --> 01:59:31.040]   much more newspapery feel.
[01:59:31.040 --> 01:59:32.200]   It's a little bit more manual.
[01:59:32.200 --> 01:59:33.920]   You have to manually enter the feeds.
[01:59:33.920 --> 01:59:36.160]   They say, next edition, we'll have a Google Reader
[01:59:36.160 --> 01:59:37.640]   sync, which would be very nice.
[01:59:37.640 --> 01:59:39.320]   But I like the way it builds a newspaper.
[01:59:39.320 --> 01:59:41.440]   And even within the newspaper, you
[01:59:41.440 --> 01:59:46.120]   can scroll the stories, which is kind of wonderful,
[01:59:46.120 --> 01:59:48.520]   inside the column, which is kind of silly.
[01:59:48.520 --> 01:59:51.360]   But in a way, it's a great way to skim a lot of news very
[01:59:51.360 --> 01:59:52.120]   quickly.
[01:59:52.120 --> 01:59:54.000]   So it's a little slow to build it,
[01:59:54.000 --> 01:59:55.480]   depending on your internet connectivity.
[01:59:55.480 --> 01:59:58.920]   But I just love the way the Early Edition--
[01:59:58.920 --> 02:00:00.920]   what I'm liking is seeing different ways people are
[02:00:00.920 --> 02:00:03.320]   handling this issue of how to get more information
[02:00:03.320 --> 02:00:04.480]   onto the screen.
[02:00:04.480 --> 02:00:07.520]   And I really love the iPad as a content consumption device.
[02:00:07.520 --> 02:00:10.760]   The one thing-- and Instapaper and Net Newswire are both just
[02:00:10.760 --> 02:00:11.800]   perfect examples of it.
[02:00:11.800 --> 02:00:14.280]   And it goes back to my complaint earlier in the show
[02:00:14.280 --> 02:00:17.840]   about the iWork apps and how you can't figure out how to get
[02:00:17.840 --> 02:00:18.800]   your documents from here to there.
[02:00:18.800 --> 02:00:22.480]   With Instapaper and Net Newswire, it feels like the future.
[02:00:22.480 --> 02:00:25.120]   Where I'm sitting at my Mac, and I'm reading feeds,
[02:00:25.120 --> 02:00:26.400]   and I quit Net Newswire.
[02:00:26.400 --> 02:00:29.400]   Oh, but the last item I had was something I do want to read
[02:00:29.400 --> 02:00:30.960]   later, so I send it to Instapaper.
[02:00:30.960 --> 02:00:33.480]   And then I go downstairs, and I pick up my iPad,
[02:00:33.480 --> 02:00:35.080]   and I turn on Instapaper.
[02:00:35.080 --> 02:00:37.520]   There's the article I just sent to Instapaper.
[02:00:37.520 --> 02:00:40.480]   And when I leave it, after I read it and I open Net Newswire
[02:00:40.480 --> 02:00:43.560]   on my iPad, the feeds, all the unread items,
[02:00:43.560 --> 02:00:45.880]   are in sync with where I left them from my Mac.
[02:00:45.880 --> 02:00:51.320]   It is absolutely Star Trek living in the future,
[02:00:51.320 --> 02:00:55.600]   using these multiple devices as clients
[02:00:55.600 --> 02:00:59.080]   to one set of information in my head.
[02:00:59.080 --> 02:01:01.200]   It's really, really-- both of them are great apps.
[02:01:01.200 --> 02:01:02.320]   As long as we're giving thumbs up,
[02:01:02.320 --> 02:01:04.000]   the thumbs down to the Wall Street Journal,
[02:01:04.000 --> 02:01:05.680]   which gave away an app for free.
[02:01:05.680 --> 02:01:08.160]   And if you're a subscriber, like I am, I thought,
[02:01:08.160 --> 02:01:09.400]   oh, great, I logged into my account,
[02:01:09.400 --> 02:01:10.240]   and I was getting the journal.
[02:01:10.240 --> 02:01:11.080]   I thought, this is great.
[02:01:11.080 --> 02:01:13.120]   And then after two days, they said, now you have to pay.
[02:01:13.120 --> 02:01:14.960]   And you have to pay--
[02:01:14.960 --> 02:01:15.800]   and you have to pay what it was.
[02:01:15.800 --> 02:01:18.160]   It's $4 or $5 a week.
[02:01:18.160 --> 02:01:19.640]   And it's like-- I just deleted it.
[02:01:19.640 --> 02:01:22.440]   It's like, I got some other apps here.
[02:01:22.440 --> 02:01:24.320]   New York Times is offering free content.
[02:01:24.320 --> 02:01:26.880]   They call it Editor's Choice, which is a lot.
[02:01:26.880 --> 02:01:31.760]   AP has a very weird looking app that maybe not so great.
[02:01:31.760 --> 02:01:34.880]   However, NPR and BBC News have done a really good job
[02:01:34.880 --> 02:01:38.000]   with making iPad apps as well.
[02:01:38.000 --> 02:01:41.960]   Did you hear the story about the New York Times app?
[02:01:41.960 --> 02:01:43.440]   No, what is the story behind it?
[02:01:43.440 --> 02:01:47.000]   So I forget the source, and I apologize to who wrote this up.
[02:01:47.000 --> 02:01:49.200]   It might have been the Media Memo website.
[02:01:49.200 --> 02:01:49.840]   I forget.
[02:01:49.840 --> 02:01:51.120]   But my apologies.
[02:01:51.120 --> 02:01:52.000]   I don't have it on top of my head.
[02:01:52.000 --> 02:01:54.400]   But the story is-- and this is not on the record.
[02:01:54.400 --> 02:01:56.880]   It's conjecture, though-- that the New York Times
[02:01:56.880 --> 02:01:59.400]   is deal with Amazon for the Kindle.
[02:01:59.400 --> 02:02:00.760]   And you subscribe to it.
[02:02:00.760 --> 02:02:01.400]   I forget.
[02:02:01.400 --> 02:02:02.400]   You pay something.
[02:02:02.400 --> 02:02:04.680]   You pay something a month, and you get the New York Times--
[02:02:04.680 --> 02:02:06.600]   the full New York Times delivered.
[02:02:06.600 --> 02:02:08.640]   That deal they have is--
[02:02:08.640 --> 02:02:10.840]   $20 a month.
[02:02:10.840 --> 02:02:12.960]   So they can't-- the deal stipulates
[02:02:12.960 --> 02:02:15.560]   that they can't give the full New York Times
[02:02:15.560 --> 02:02:19.280]   to another Kindle-like device for a lower price.
[02:02:19.280 --> 02:02:21.880]   They can do it, but it's not exclusive.
[02:02:21.880 --> 02:02:24.960]   But they can't undercut the price on the Kindle.
[02:02:24.960 --> 02:02:29.840]   Well, the iPad app is free, at least for now.
[02:02:29.840 --> 02:02:31.880]   So that's why they're doing this editor's choice thing,
[02:02:31.880 --> 02:02:35.120]   where it's not the full content of the daily New York Times.
[02:02:35.120 --> 02:02:36.320]   It's pretty good, though.
[02:02:36.320 --> 02:02:37.120]   It is pretty good.
[02:02:37.120 --> 02:02:38.600]   It's the op-ed page.
[02:02:38.600 --> 02:02:39.920]   It's the full front page.
[02:02:39.920 --> 02:02:40.360]   Yeah.
[02:02:40.360 --> 02:02:43.200]   The technology page, the business page.
[02:02:43.200 --> 02:02:44.000]   And it's nicely done.
[02:02:44.000 --> 02:02:45.560]   There are ads in it.
[02:02:45.560 --> 02:02:46.600]   That was another thing, by the way.
[02:02:46.600 --> 02:02:47.600]   And then that's a really good--
[02:02:47.600 --> 02:02:48.360]   Yeah, they're subtle.
[02:02:48.360 --> 02:02:48.960]   They're not bad.
[02:02:48.960 --> 02:02:52.840]   The Wall Street Journal, full page ads, every three seconds--
[02:02:52.840 --> 02:02:54.840]   man, they did a crappy job.
[02:02:54.840 --> 02:02:56.520]   And I'm glad to see Rupert Murdoch go down.
[02:02:56.520 --> 02:02:58.360]   One thing that's really weird-- and maybe you can see it
[02:02:58.360 --> 02:03:02.280]   right now in the Times app with the ads is the ads
[02:03:02.280 --> 02:03:04.200]   are their own swipe region.
[02:03:04.200 --> 02:03:06.480]   So when you go to swipe from one page to another,
[02:03:06.480 --> 02:03:10.000]   if your finger starts on an ad, it doesn't take.
[02:03:10.000 --> 02:03:10.720]   Oh, yeah, you're right.
[02:03:10.720 --> 02:03:12.240]   The ad stays.
[02:03:12.240 --> 02:03:13.800]   Right.
[02:03:13.800 --> 02:03:14.880]   I thought it was a bug at first.
[02:03:14.880 --> 02:03:15.760]   I was like, this is nuts.
[02:03:15.760 --> 02:03:16.880]   But then I realized what it was.
[02:03:16.880 --> 02:03:20.000]   And I guess it's so that they can deliver interactive ads,
[02:03:20.000 --> 02:03:21.400]   where your taps go--
[02:03:21.400 --> 02:03:21.720]   I don't know.
[02:03:21.720 --> 02:03:23.640]   It's a little weird.
[02:03:23.640 --> 02:03:24.840]   They do a really nice job.
[02:03:24.840 --> 02:03:27.320]   The ad doesn't re-have to refresh every single time, either.
[02:03:27.320 --> 02:03:28.840]   I think they do a nice job.
[02:03:28.840 --> 02:03:33.880]   This is a very readable, browsable interface, so much better
[02:03:33.880 --> 02:03:36.080]   than the Kindle, frankly, for reading them.
[02:03:36.080 --> 02:03:36.680]   Periodicals.
[02:03:36.680 --> 02:03:39.840]   I can't wait till The New Yorker does an iPad for you.
[02:03:39.840 --> 02:03:41.640]   And it feels like The New York Times.
[02:03:41.640 --> 02:03:42.480]   I mean, if you're--
[02:03:42.480 --> 02:03:44.520]   I mean, it's obviously putting on--
[02:03:44.520 --> 02:03:46.640]   I got to start getting more gray in my hair here.
[02:03:46.640 --> 02:03:49.160]   But if you really love the paper edition of The New York
[02:03:49.160 --> 02:03:52.000]   Times, or ever did, I mean, this really
[02:03:52.000 --> 02:03:53.840]   has that exact same vibe.
[02:03:53.840 --> 02:03:54.880]   Right.
[02:03:54.880 --> 02:03:56.920]   Yeah, I'm kind of hopeful.
[02:03:56.920 --> 02:03:58.880]   I was hopeful that this is the kind of experience
[02:03:58.880 --> 02:04:01.040]   we'd have with the Kindle.
[02:04:01.040 --> 02:04:03.400]   And I think they've done a really--
[02:04:03.400 --> 02:04:04.520]   I'm sorry, the iPad.
[02:04:04.520 --> 02:04:07.240]   And I think they've done a really nice job.
[02:04:07.240 --> 02:04:11.680]   Andy and I go, I think you're the last to make a pick.
[02:04:11.680 --> 02:04:13.680]   I will make a pick.
[02:04:13.680 --> 02:04:16.400]   I was trying to avoid the apps that were up.
[02:04:16.400 --> 02:04:17.120]   They were relatively--
[02:04:17.120 --> 02:04:18.720]   I had, like, at launch day.
[02:04:18.720 --> 02:04:23.560]   But it's more of the topic than the Marvel Comics app
[02:04:23.560 --> 02:04:24.120]   I recommend.
[02:04:24.120 --> 02:04:25.720]   I love this app, and I didn't recommend it
[02:04:25.720 --> 02:04:26.760]   just so that you could.
[02:04:26.760 --> 02:04:30.000]   It's done so exceptionally well.
[02:04:30.000 --> 02:04:33.600]   Everybody who's a comics fan has always thought that the reason
[02:04:33.600 --> 02:04:35.920]   why digital comics hasn't really taken off,
[02:04:35.920 --> 02:04:38.120]   there's never been a device like the iPad
[02:04:38.120 --> 02:04:42.160]   that can really show off a complicated document that
[02:04:42.160 --> 02:04:45.280]   can't really be reflowed into a smaller page form.
[02:04:45.280 --> 02:04:49.120]   You really have to have that entire unit of a page in some way.
[02:04:49.120 --> 02:04:52.240]   And yet, you still-- you need color, you need easy navigation,
[02:04:52.240 --> 02:04:54.600]   you need to be able to move from one spot to another very,
[02:04:54.600 --> 02:04:56.840]   very easily, and that's pretty much what they've
[02:04:56.840 --> 02:04:58.320]   done with the Marvel Comics app.
[02:04:58.320 --> 02:05:02.920]   It's actually, I believe they licensed the Comicsology app.
[02:05:02.920 --> 02:05:05.160]   They have their Comicsology also has their story,
[02:05:05.160 --> 02:05:09.400]   uses this basic technology that has titles by image and others.
[02:05:09.400 --> 02:05:11.040]   But it really does show the proof of concept
[02:05:11.040 --> 02:05:15.240]   that a comic book is perfectly readable in this form factor.
[02:05:15.240 --> 02:05:17.160]   And I think this will show everybody
[02:05:17.160 --> 02:05:19.840]   who's developing an app like this exactly the way
[02:05:19.840 --> 02:05:23.240]   that these things should go, that if you hold it up vertically,
[02:05:23.240 --> 02:05:27.280]   the page fills up the entire screen only slightly smaller.
[02:05:27.280 --> 02:05:29.920]   And it's perfectly readable at the smaller size.
[02:05:29.920 --> 02:05:32.720]   If you tilt it on its size, on its side,
[02:05:32.720 --> 02:05:34.360]   then it will-- you have the opportunity
[02:05:34.360 --> 02:05:37.560]   to see it at full page width size.
[02:05:37.560 --> 02:05:39.960]   But it will also give you this neat navigator.
[02:05:39.960 --> 02:05:40.920]   Hang on.
[02:05:40.920 --> 02:05:43.040]   I just love the thing that you showed when you reviewed it
[02:05:43.040 --> 02:05:44.080]   with Alex.
[02:05:44.080 --> 02:05:46.400]   Once you get in that page mode, you just tap it.
[02:05:46.400 --> 02:05:47.160]   Right.
[02:05:47.160 --> 02:05:47.800]   And you go--
[02:05:47.800 --> 02:05:48.320]   Right.
[02:05:48.320 --> 02:05:49.720]   --by the name.
[02:05:49.720 --> 02:05:51.680]   Yeah, if you don't necessarily want
[02:05:51.680 --> 02:05:54.240]   to see the entire page as one unit,
[02:05:54.240 --> 02:05:57.040]   what you can do is simply tap on the upper left corner.
[02:05:57.040 --> 02:06:01.400]   It'll automatically zoom in on that bubble of dialogue.
[02:06:01.400 --> 02:06:05.920]   But on addition to that, you can just simply page--
[02:06:05.920 --> 02:06:06.920]   hitting like page buttons.
[02:06:06.920 --> 02:06:09.800]   It will just simply take you to the next bit of dialogue,
[02:06:09.800 --> 02:06:12.440]   or the next scene of action, and sort of navigate you
[02:06:12.440 --> 02:06:17.600]   through the comic page panel after panel, beat for beat,
[02:06:17.600 --> 02:06:18.840]   shot for shot.
[02:06:18.840 --> 02:06:21.000]   And you can read the entire comic that way.
[02:06:21.000 --> 02:06:25.080]   I'm glad that it has support for both types of viewing.
[02:06:25.080 --> 02:06:27.560]   Now, I started off by saying that--
[02:06:27.560 --> 02:06:29.880]   I think the Marvel Comics app by Kamikama College
[02:06:29.880 --> 02:06:33.600]   is done exactly the way you'd want a comic book app to be done.
[02:06:33.600 --> 02:06:34.880]   I don't think that-- obviously, I
[02:06:34.880 --> 02:06:36.600]   don't think that's going to be the last that we'll see of it.
[02:06:36.600 --> 02:06:38.840]   I think that really is the proof of concept that
[02:06:38.840 --> 02:06:41.520]   demonstrates to every other publisher and every other third
[02:06:41.520 --> 02:06:43.880]   party developer that they can make these apps.
[02:06:43.880 --> 02:06:47.480]   I've loaded up-- in terms of other third party apps,
[02:06:47.480 --> 02:06:48.920]   what we're looking for are apps that
[02:06:48.920 --> 02:06:52.320]   will let you use just generic, unlocked comic book files.
[02:06:52.320 --> 02:06:55.000]   There are two different formats-- CBER and CBZ.
[02:06:55.000 --> 02:06:56.200]   In the end, they're very, very simple.
[02:06:56.200 --> 02:06:58.040]   They just compressed archive files
[02:06:58.040 --> 02:07:01.040]   of just a big stack of JPEGs with each page
[02:07:01.040 --> 02:07:02.960]   representing another JPEG file.
[02:07:02.960 --> 02:07:05.560]   There are two apps like that on there right now.
[02:07:05.560 --> 02:07:07.480]   Neither of them are terribly good.
[02:07:07.480 --> 02:07:09.920]   They're ports of iPhone apps.
[02:07:09.920 --> 02:07:11.880]   And you could tell that the controls are not
[02:07:11.880 --> 02:07:13.400]   meant for full page swiping.
[02:07:13.400 --> 02:07:17.440]   It's more like physical page turn buttons than anything else.
[02:07:17.440 --> 02:07:18.280]   They function.
[02:07:18.280 --> 02:07:21.320]   And as a matter of fact, I read eight issues of a comic
[02:07:21.320 --> 02:07:23.960]   on the flight over to Denver and enjoyed it a lot.
[02:07:23.960 --> 02:07:26.200]   But in a month from now, I really
[02:07:26.200 --> 02:07:28.560]   think you're going to see a real explosion in comic book apps.
[02:07:28.560 --> 02:07:30.080]   And it will just emphatically state
[02:07:30.080 --> 02:07:33.920]   how good digital comics can be on a device like the iPad.
[02:07:33.920 --> 02:07:34.360]   Yeah.
[02:07:34.360 --> 02:07:37.800]   I'm very excited about content consumption in general.
[02:07:37.800 --> 02:07:40.680]   Before we leave the content discussion,
[02:07:40.680 --> 02:07:42.400]   have you guys played with the Netflix?
[02:07:42.400 --> 02:07:43.400]   Yes.
[02:07:43.400 --> 02:07:43.800]   Yeah.
[02:07:43.800 --> 02:07:45.240]   Watch movies.
[02:07:45.240 --> 02:07:48.680]   I mean, finally, I can rearrange my queue without a third party
[02:07:48.680 --> 02:07:49.680]   app.
[02:07:49.680 --> 02:07:50.240]   Just love it.
[02:07:50.240 --> 02:07:52.840]   I mean, the only thing was is it felt like it feels like they
[02:07:52.840 --> 02:07:54.480]   going to have to update the interface because it felt
[02:07:54.480 --> 02:07:55.200]   like it was a little rough.
[02:07:55.200 --> 02:07:56.400]   Like you're using the page.
[02:07:56.400 --> 02:07:57.680]   It's like a web page.
[02:07:57.680 --> 02:08:00.920]   Once they fix that, I mean, I was just like, oh, you know,
[02:08:00.920 --> 02:08:02.080]   it was just such a great--
[02:08:02.080 --> 02:08:06.000]   Just especially when you have the MyFi.
[02:08:06.000 --> 02:08:09.400]   And it even works great over 3G over the MyFi.
[02:08:09.400 --> 02:08:12.000]   And just the knowledge that, gee, I'm a little bored.
[02:08:12.000 --> 02:08:15.360]   I think I'll watch any of about 30,000 different top drawer
[02:08:15.360 --> 02:08:17.200]   movies and TV shows that are available to me
[02:08:17.200 --> 02:08:20.560]   via streaming for no additional charge based on my $8.95
[02:08:20.560 --> 02:08:21.760]   in Netflix sleep.
[02:08:21.760 --> 02:08:25.120]   Yeah, I think that's the thing to do because I'm an iPad owner.
[02:08:25.120 --> 02:08:27.120]   My real problem is I get in bed with the iPad
[02:08:27.120 --> 02:08:29.040]   and I have about 20 different things I want to do.
[02:08:29.040 --> 02:08:30.480]   And so I can't--
[02:08:30.480 --> 02:08:32.480]   I used to play a little this, watch the movie.
[02:08:32.480 --> 02:08:34.440]   I should throw in one more thing that you can do, which,
[02:08:34.440 --> 02:08:36.200]   of course, is watch "Twit" on the iPad.
[02:08:36.200 --> 02:08:38.120]   Houdini7 has made a great application.
[02:08:38.120 --> 02:08:40.560]   The "Twit" for the iPad or "Twit"
[02:08:40.560 --> 02:08:43.080]   pad as he calls it that has the calendar.
[02:08:43.080 --> 02:08:44.480]   It has the chat.
[02:08:44.480 --> 02:08:46.760]   And it has the video all on one page,
[02:08:46.760 --> 02:08:50.320]   makes it very easy for you to watch wherever you are on the iPad.
[02:08:50.320 --> 02:08:53.640]   Does require Wi-Fi right now due to limitations imposed
[02:08:53.640 --> 02:08:54.480]   by Apple.
[02:08:54.480 --> 02:08:56.040]   This matches the iPhone app.
[02:08:56.040 --> 02:08:58.240]   So we have an iPhone and an iPad app.
[02:08:58.240 --> 02:09:00.720]   And I told Houdini7 you should charge because you're
[02:09:00.720 --> 02:09:03.160]   putting all this work in for nothing for us.
[02:09:03.160 --> 02:09:04.800]   And so he's charging $0.99.
[02:09:04.800 --> 02:09:05.640]   But well worth it.
[02:09:05.640 --> 02:09:07.880]   And I think it's nice to give him a little bit of a tip
[02:09:07.880 --> 02:09:09.240]   when you pick it up.
[02:09:09.240 --> 02:09:10.600]   He said such a nice job.
[02:09:10.600 --> 02:09:11.680]   I thought it was a fantastic app.
[02:09:11.680 --> 02:09:13.720]   I was really glad to see it being charged for it
[02:09:13.720 --> 02:09:15.560]   because I was like, he has to get some money for this
[02:09:15.560 --> 02:09:17.400]   because it's just such a--
[02:09:17.400 --> 02:09:18.680]   obviously, a lot of work went into it.
[02:09:18.680 --> 02:09:20.080]   Yeah, I really encourage him to do that.
[02:09:20.080 --> 02:09:21.280]   I have no problem finding it.
[02:09:21.280 --> 02:09:22.480]   I have no sense as nothing.
[02:09:22.480 --> 02:09:24.040]   Yeah.
[02:09:24.040 --> 02:09:24.360]   All right.
[02:09:24.360 --> 02:09:25.240]   Hey, thanks, everybody.
[02:09:25.240 --> 02:09:26.800]   Really great to have you on John Gruber.
[02:09:26.800 --> 02:09:27.760]   Thank you for being here.
[02:09:27.760 --> 02:09:31.400]   John Gruber, of course, is the prototypical, the essential.
[02:09:31.400 --> 02:09:35.440]   The must-read Mac blogger at DaringFireball.net.
[02:09:35.440 --> 02:09:37.400]   We are glad to have you here from Philadelphia,
[02:09:37.400 --> 02:09:40.640]   home of Cable Town, USA.
[02:09:40.640 --> 02:09:42.560]   With a K, Cable Town, with a K.
[02:09:42.560 --> 02:09:44.440]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:09:44.440 --> 02:09:45.520]   Have a great day, John.
[02:09:45.520 --> 02:09:46.520]   Enjoy your iPad.
[02:09:46.520 --> 02:09:47.040]   Thanks.
[02:09:47.040 --> 02:09:50.720]   Also, Chris Breen, the Mac Daddy from Mackerel Magazine,

[02:09:55.640 --> 02:09:58.000]   Also, I'm sure you're working on an iPad book.
[02:09:58.000 --> 02:09:59.880]   I would guess, yes.
[02:09:59.880 --> 02:10:03.000]   You know, actually, I'm going to be doing an iPad video
[02:10:03.000 --> 02:10:04.320]   training for lynda.com.
[02:10:04.320 --> 02:10:05.520]   Oh, cool.
[02:10:05.520 --> 02:10:06.240]   That'll be fun.
[02:10:06.240 --> 02:10:07.600]   I'll look forward to that.
[02:10:07.600 --> 02:10:08.880]   That's great.
[02:10:08.880 --> 02:10:10.880]   And anywhere you want to send people to, Chris,
[02:10:10.880 --> 02:10:12.560]   anything else you want to plug?
[02:10:12.560 --> 02:10:14.200]   Oh, you can just go to Mackerel.com.
[02:10:14.200 --> 02:10:15.760]   That's a good place to go.
[02:10:15.760 --> 02:10:18.000]   Andy Inako is the editor-in-chief of the Chicago Sun
[02:10:18.000 --> 02:10:18.440]   Times.
[02:10:18.440 --> 02:10:22.240]   His website is CelestiaWaste of bandwidth, cwob.com.
[02:10:22.240 --> 02:10:23.120]   And read his-- what is it?
[02:10:23.120 --> 02:10:26.880]   Six-part review of the iPad in the Chicago Sun Times.
[02:10:26.880 --> 02:10:28.160]   Yeah.
[02:10:28.160 --> 02:10:30.880]   6,000-word main review, and about 5,000 words
[02:10:30.880 --> 02:10:33.440]   of other things.
[02:10:33.440 --> 02:10:34.840]   And you are working on the book.
[02:10:34.840 --> 02:10:36.520]   I got a lot of sleep on Saturday night.
[02:10:36.520 --> 02:10:38.520]   That's why I missed my flight Sunday morning.
[02:10:38.520 --> 02:10:39.400]   Oops.
[02:10:39.400 --> 02:10:40.800]   And I know you are working on a book,
[02:10:40.800 --> 02:10:42.160]   so we'll look forward to that.
[02:10:42.160 --> 02:10:45.560]   Is it going to be called iPad Unleashed?
[02:10:45.560 --> 02:10:46.200]   Nope.
[02:10:46.200 --> 02:10:47.200]   iPad fully loaded.
[02:10:47.200 --> 02:10:47.800]   Fully loaded, I think.
[02:10:47.800 --> 02:10:49.120]   It's probably worse for later in the year.
[02:10:49.120 --> 02:10:50.360]   But it's going to be a different topic.
[02:10:50.360 --> 02:10:52.600]   This is going to be a general interest iPad book.
[02:10:52.600 --> 02:10:53.840]   I'm really excited about it.
[02:10:53.840 --> 02:10:56.120]   I'm consuming my first chapters this week, as a matter of fact.
[02:10:56.120 --> 02:10:56.640]   Right.
[02:10:56.640 --> 02:10:58.200]   We should have the title locked down.
[02:10:58.200 --> 02:11:01.200]   I should be able to direct people to a pre-order page
[02:11:01.200 --> 02:11:02.120]   next week, hopefully.
[02:11:02.120 --> 02:11:03.080]   Fantastic.
[02:11:03.080 --> 02:11:04.640]   Alex Lindsey is the head of the Pixel Core.
[02:11:04.640 --> 02:11:07.800]   Pixelcore.com in a great place for you to get trained
[02:11:07.800 --> 02:11:10.440]   and then to get work as a multimedia artist.
[02:11:10.440 --> 02:11:11.560]   And a special deal.
[02:11:11.560 --> 02:11:13.960]   We finally finished it.
[02:11:13.960 --> 02:11:14.880]   Finished the launch.
[02:11:14.880 --> 02:11:15.560]   You finished the launch?
[02:11:15.560 --> 02:11:16.040]   You finished the launch?
[02:11:16.040 --> 02:11:16.520]   Oh.
[02:11:16.520 --> 02:11:16.720]   Yeah.
[02:11:16.720 --> 02:11:18.240]   So people have been asking us over and over
[02:11:18.240 --> 02:11:20.080]   when we're going to do the relaunch of the Pixel Core
[02:11:20.080 --> 02:11:22.520]   and change a lot of the structures and everything else,
[02:11:22.520 --> 02:11:23.680]   because we've been talking about it.
[02:11:23.680 --> 02:11:25.040]   And this is the week.
[02:11:25.040 --> 02:11:28.040]   So we had people start-- some of the former members
[02:11:28.040 --> 02:11:29.160]   start coming in last week.
[02:11:29.160 --> 02:11:31.520]   And now we're opening it up to everyone else.
[02:11:31.520 --> 02:11:35.280]   And so instead of being $50 a month, the Pixel Core
[02:11:35.280 --> 02:11:40.400]   is now dropping to $99 a year.
[02:11:40.400 --> 02:11:41.440]   We've changed some of the structures.
[02:11:41.440 --> 02:11:42.880]   Oh, that's a great deal.
[02:11:42.880 --> 02:11:46.040]   It's a-- you know, it's really--
[02:11:46.040 --> 02:11:47.720]   we really wanted to make it something that I actually
[02:11:47.720 --> 02:11:51.240]   think is going to be more compelling than what we had before
[02:11:51.240 --> 02:11:53.160]   in a way that we can make it more affordable.
[02:11:53.160 --> 02:11:54.120]   So there's lots of challenges.
[02:11:54.120 --> 02:11:56.600]   You're going to see live feeds of us actually doing podcasts
[02:11:56.600 --> 02:11:59.240]   and visual effects production and lots of shooting.
[02:11:59.240 --> 02:12:00.680]   You'll be able to discuss it with other people.
[02:12:00.680 --> 02:12:03.160]   We're going to give people production challenges
[02:12:03.160 --> 02:12:05.080]   that they can work on together.
[02:12:05.080 --> 02:12:07.680]   And it's-- and so we're also going
[02:12:07.680 --> 02:12:10.720]   to extend this week to a handful of podcasts
[02:12:10.720 --> 02:12:13.160]   that are friends of ours.
[02:12:13.160 --> 02:12:15.000]   $50 off that, because we really want
[02:12:15.000 --> 02:12:17.240]   the people who are watching these shows
[02:12:17.240 --> 02:12:20.840]   and really connected to us in first.
[02:12:20.840 --> 02:12:23.080]   It's really important from a community perspective.
[02:12:23.080 --> 02:12:25.400]   And so we're going to give $50 off.
[02:12:25.400 --> 02:12:26.400]   So it's $49.
[02:12:26.400 --> 02:12:29.280]   It's less than a buck a week to get an awful lot of--
[02:12:30.240 --> 02:12:32.040]   training in community.
[02:12:32.040 --> 02:12:36.560]   And so all you need to do is use a credit--
[02:12:36.560 --> 02:12:41.000]   the coupon code is MBW, break weekly.
[02:12:41.000 --> 02:12:43.600]   So go ahead and use that coupon.
[02:12:43.600 --> 02:12:45.040]   And you'll get it for $49.
[02:12:45.040 --> 02:12:49.360]   And we're pretty excited.
[02:12:49.360 --> 02:12:51.880]   We've been working for about 18 months
[02:12:51.880 --> 02:12:54.120]   to get the structure and put all the pieces in place.
[02:12:54.120 --> 02:12:56.480]   And we're going to be doing a lot of live streaming
[02:12:56.480 --> 02:12:58.320]   for the members and a lot of discussions.
[02:12:58.320 --> 02:13:01.640]   And so anyway, so we're finally getting out--
[02:13:01.640 --> 02:13:03.560]   out of wraps this week.
[02:13:03.560 --> 02:13:04.160]   Very good.
[02:13:04.160 --> 02:13:05.240]   Thank you, Alex Lindsey.
[02:13:05.240 --> 02:13:06.200]   That's exciting.
[02:13:06.200 --> 02:13:08.040]   Pixelcore.com, of course, a podcast,
[02:13:08.040 --> 02:13:09.400]   or Pixelcore.tv.
[02:13:09.400 --> 02:13:11.840]   And you're going off to NAB soon, right?
[02:13:11.840 --> 02:13:12.280]   Next week.
[02:13:12.280 --> 02:13:14.440]   And we're going to be streaming live.
[02:13:14.440 --> 02:13:16.440]   We're taking-- I saw you with the live view.
[02:13:16.440 --> 02:13:18.640]   And I was just like, oh, we got to do so much money.
[02:13:18.640 --> 02:13:20.960]   So we got one of the-- I think the box shows up today.
[02:13:20.960 --> 02:13:22.120]   And we're going to be testing it.
[02:13:22.120 --> 02:13:24.840]   So we'll be streaming from some of the parties,
[02:13:24.840 --> 02:13:26.440]   from some of the events.
[02:13:26.440 --> 02:13:28.000]   Whoever will let us turn the camera on.
[02:13:28.000 --> 02:13:29.920]   And we're going to stream it and do some coverage.
[02:13:29.920 --> 02:13:30.760]   So it should be fun.
[02:13:30.760 --> 02:13:33.800]   We use the live view, the you stream streamer,
[02:13:33.800 --> 02:13:35.440]   on Friday night.

[02:13:37.520 --> 02:13:40.120]   and a young fellow, a really talented guy,
[02:13:40.120 --> 02:13:42.680]   went with Colleen and Dane down to the Palo Alto story
[02:13:42.680 --> 02:13:46.560]   interviewed Woz, a bunch of other interesting people,
[02:13:46.560 --> 02:13:49.960]   including the guy who did Chat Roulette and Robert Scoble

[02:14:04.840 --> 02:14:07.480]   because that helps us raise up through the ranks
