[00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:19.280]   And what's wrong with Swift UI in 2022?
[00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:21.280]   A lot of people weigh in.

[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.040]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly to show we cover the latest Apple news,
[00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:27.120]   of which there is very little because...
[00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:30.240]   Here comes WWDC in less than a week.
[00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:31.680]   Renee Richie is here.
[00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.200]   He won't be here next week.
[00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.920]   Don't know why.
[00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:35.840]   Have no idea why.
[00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:36.400]   Come stop here.
[00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:37.600]   Come stop, come stop.
[00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:38.160]   Come stop there.
[00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:38.800]   Sweetie.
[00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:40.480]   Come stop, come.
[00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:40.960]   Hi Leo.
[00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:41.440]   Hi.
[00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:41.680]   It's a baby.
[00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:42.720]   Um...
[00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:46.000]   I understand that you can't say anything, but...
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:51.520]   It sounds as if it's going to be one of them hybrid events on Monday.
[00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:53.280]   They have thousands...
[00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:54.880]   I don't know how many developers ended up inviting,
[00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:57.360]   but they did like a second round and it seemed like a lot of people.
[00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:58.880]   There's two thousand seats in the...
[00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:02.240]   Two thousand seats in the Steve Jobs, uh, Sea-Ater.
[00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:03.680]   And it's...
[00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:05.920]   But I think they're going to have more because they're going to doing a whole...
[00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:07.120]   They could have a tent outside.
[00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:08.000]   They're rumors, I think.
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.240]   No, I think Gruber was suggesting it might be one of the buildings on Tantal,
[00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:13.680]   across from the visitor center,
[00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.680]   might be repurposed as a developer center.
[00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:16.000]   That's...
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.240]   It'd be super interesting because they haven't done anything like that before.
[00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:20.000]   That's what Gurman is saying.
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:25.440]   WWDC, in-person attendees granted special access to four hills.
[00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:28.880]   I'm sorry, you can choose which one to die on.
[00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:29.280]   Hills.
[00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.840]   That's Andy and Akka, the VVH.
[00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:36.240]   In Boston, uh, and I thank you so much for being here on Sunday on Twitter.
[00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:40.320]   It was great having you having your, uh, having your voice.
[00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:43.920]   Always, always fun to be able to talk to you on a weekend.
[00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:48.000]   Yeah, it's a little different and we get to talk about more than Apple.
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:48.720]   So that's fun.
[00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:49.280]   Yeah.
[00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:54.160]   I learned that there's, that if you're podcasting here, like at 6 p.m.
[00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:58.640]   Then there's an absolute laser beam of sunlight that comes in right through that
[00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:01.440]   one tiny crack and that one curtain right over there.
[00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:01.920]   Nice.
[00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:06.400]   So yes, I had to, I had to do with the, what apologies to call a barbecue roll,
[00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:09.280]   throughout the show, to keep maintain temperature.
[00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:13.760]   Also Alex Lindsey, office hours dot global.
[00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:14.960]   Good to see you Alex.
[00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:16.320]   Good to be here.
[00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:18.640]   Office hours will be doing its own coverage.
[00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:22.960]   I'll give a plug to the competition since you probably want to watch that anyway.
[00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:24.080]   They'll be doing their own coverage.
[00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:24.480]   It's time.
[00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:25.360]   It's not competition.
[00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:26.800]   It's not 10 a.m.
[00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:28.880]   On Monday and then after.
[00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:29.760]   It's the same time.
[00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:30.640]   Yeah, it's exactly the same.
[00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:34.480]   And then in the evening, you're going to do a, uh, thing with Renee and I just
[00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:37.600]   Dean, a bunch of other people, kind of a breakdown.
[00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:38.720]   Yeah.
[00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:39.120]   Well, yeah.
[00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:42.160]   And we have, um, we have a couple developers with us as well.
[00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:45.520]   So they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, hold us to the, to the actual.
[00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:50.880]   Is it, is it the more interesting of the state of the union after the, the initial keynote?
[00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:51.360]   Is that over?
[00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:51.920]   For developers.
[00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:52.480]   It is.
[00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:54.400]   Like it's definitely, yeah.
[00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:55.920]   Well, and it's not just that they talk about stuff.
[00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:59.040]   The, the, the keynote is really publicly facing.
[00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:04.800]   Like this is another place that where it's, it's developer leaning, but it's definitely aimed
[00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:10.240]   at the general public while the, the, um, state of the union is for the, for the developers.
[00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:14.000]   Like this is, this is for you to see this is, and this, it's much more nitty gritty,
[00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:15.440]   in much more.
[00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:18.160]   And you see a lot of other features that were might have been glazed over.
[00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:22.240]   Like it's something that they'll mention like that'll be like a word in a sentence
[00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:28.080]   in the keynote will be 15 minutes or 10 minutes in the, in the state of the union.
[00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:30.560]   Um, if it's important and then they dig into it a lot deeper.
[00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:34.720]   And then of course the rest of the week is all the other movies that did dig into it way deeper,
[00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:35.600]   way deeper.
[00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:37.840]   You say movies as opposed to live.
[00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:40.880]   Some of this is going to be live this time.
[00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:41.120]   Yeah.
[00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:42.640]   Only the key.
[00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:43.040]   Okay.
[00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:43.920]   Only the keynote.
[00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:44.320]   Yeah.
[00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:45.280]   The sessions.
[00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:47.200]   The sessions are all really multiple events.
[00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:51.680]   There's like the, like Alex said, there's the keynote, which is consumer facing the state of
[00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:53.360]   the union, which is developer facing.
[00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:57.840]   There's the Apple design awards, which are just a lot of fun, but then there's two major tracks.
[00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:03.040]   One is the sessions where a bunch of engineers and designers get up on stage and do deep dives
[00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:05.040]   into everything that's new in the frameworks.
[00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:09.200]   And there's labs where you can actually go and have, well, before times you could go and
[00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:13.840]   have Apple designers and Apple developers, engineers, the people responsible for your frameworks.
[00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:17.760]   Like telling, you know, Chris Leecia why he keeps breaking the accelerate framework with
[00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:21.200]   every one of his apps and you talk about your bugs and get advice.
[00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:23.440]   And those parts are all still virtual.
[00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:28.640]   So all the labs and all the sessions, like for the last two years, they've been prerecorded.
[00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:32.240]   Evangelism works really hard with the engineers and designers so they can have really good
[00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:33.360]   presentation skills.
[00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:36.560]   They put like their own little personal things on the desk and they film those.
[00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:40.240]   And then you can go and watch those and the labs are happening over WebEx still.
[00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:42.240]   So that, you know, people everywhere can take part.
[00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:48.720]   And as a consumer of the videos, first of the ones that were done on stage and now the ones that are,
[00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:51.040]   you know, I watch a lot of these videos.
[00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:55.440]   I'm so glad that they moved to prerecorded.
[00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:56.640]   It's so much better.
[00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:59.440]   Look at it's so much better to watch it because they can't take questions.
[00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:00.720]   Anyway, it's not like it's interactive.
[00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:02.480]   They're not taking questions up on stage.
[00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:06.400]   They're simply doing something they've rehearsed for weeks to do it.
[00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:07.920]   Yeah, might as well record it, right?
[00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:12.560]   And accept that they're nervous in front of a whole lot of people and something may not work perfectly.
[00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:14.480]   And it just scratches over and over again.
[00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:17.920]   Yeah, like it's just like all these things that don't really work.
[00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:23.520]   And so the fact that it's all prerecorded way better and
[00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:27.440]   like I wouldn't, you know, you can now play it back at 2X,
[00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:32.400]   which is about the right speed, you know, like to watch the stuff for most of it is like 1.5 to 2X.
[00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:39.440]   And so I think that it's a huge, it's a big bump up.
[00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:40.000]   I don't know.
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:41.440]   I hope they don't go back.
[00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:48.080]   Like I hope that they just like folk, the labs eventually could be really done well in person again.
[00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:50.560]   And I think there's and I think being able,
[00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:52.800]   developers being able to hang out with each other somewhere in the future.
[00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:59.920]   But I think that the era of, I'm hoping that the era of sessions being done live is over.
[00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:02.240]   So and then some press is going to get invited.
[00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:02.720]   I gather.
[00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:04.960]   I won't say how I gather that.
[00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:10.640]   Well, I mean, that's interesting that a handful, I guess.
[00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:14.320]   Maybe because there'll be something to show afterwards,
[00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:16.480]   something in a demo area.
[00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:17.680]   I'm not getting any hopes up.
[00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:19.040]   I'm not going to have a single hope raised.
[00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:21.200]   I'm not expecting any VR headsets.
[00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:22.800]   I'm not expecting any Mac books.
[00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:26.720]   I am expecting, I'm hoping for a Mac Pro preview because they've done that before.
[00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:30.560]   But every year, like the rumors, especially like they get so repetitive and they're always like,
[00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:31.520]   everything is coming.
[00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:34.880]   And I was just looking through my YouTube feed and it's like confirmed.
[00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:35.840]   This is going to be here.
[00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:37.360]   And I went back to 2013.
[00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:38.160]   Confirmed.
[00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:40.560]   This is going to be like link bait from YouTube.
[00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:41.200]   You know that.
[00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:44.000]   And then I get like, I don't want to be disappointed.
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.080]   I would rather be like surprised than here's a mark.
[00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:52.080]   Mark, well, actually, here's what Ming Chi Quo says is don't expect any VR stuff.
[00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:54.480]   And he may, I think this is speculation as part of it.
[00:07:54.480 --> 00:07:55.520]   He makes the excellent point.
[00:07:55.520 --> 00:08:01.760]   You don't want to give the competition any idea of what that VR headset might look like.
[00:08:01.760 --> 00:08:05.280]   On the other hand, we know that the reality of OS trademark
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:11.040]   is for has already been established and then internationally for the day after the keynote.
[00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:11.840]   So they're obviously.
[00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:12.800]   That's just performa though.
[00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:16.720]   Like that's like the established at six months ago and has to be renewed in six months.
[00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:17.440]   Oh, okay.
[00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:18.400]   So it's not meaningful.
[00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:19.120]   That's apple lawyer stuff.
[00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:20.000]   That's a coincidence.
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:20.880]   It's June 8th.
[00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:23.280]   It's not it's not a meaningful.
[00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:24.480]   Yeah, it's a lot of headlines.
[00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:28.480]   Although I suspect that they might say something about reality OS without giving away
[00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:30.320]   what the headset looks like or anything like that.
[00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:34.320]   I think Andy nailed it last time when he said like at some point the FCC is going to leak all
[00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:35.760]   this stuff for Apple and they'll announce.
[00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:37.120]   So as we say a month before that.
[00:08:37.120 --> 00:08:38.080]   Yeah.
[00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:41.440]   We have seen the FCC leaks of some new Macs though, right?
[00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:43.760]   Or no.
[00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:46.560]   So oh no, that was the weird Wi-Fi thing that we saw.
[00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:47.120]   The dongle.
[00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:47.840]   The dongle.
[00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:53.040]   They would would they have to do if they have M2 MacBook Airs,
[00:08:53.040 --> 00:08:56.480]   which seems the most credible rumor, colorful M2 MacBook Airs,
[00:08:56.480 --> 00:08:59.680]   would they have to have had those through the FCC by now?
[00:08:59.680 --> 00:09:02.160]   I still think it's like an Apple store thing.
[00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:05.920]   That's going to be until I see like an actual product and then it's a Siemens for Apple
[00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:06.480]   technicians.
[00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:09.280]   Well, I'm saying say that.
[00:09:09.280 --> 00:09:13.360]   Oh, you mean the dongle, but what about the MacBook Air M2 MacBook Air?
[00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:15.280]   Why have we not seen anything about that?
[00:09:15.280 --> 00:09:17.680]   You think that's not going to happen on Monday?
[00:09:17.680 --> 00:09:23.360]   It's like WCT to me is always like it's mostly about the software.
[00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:26.640]   It's towards sometimes there's a lot of pro centric products,
[00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:30.720]   but it's mostly like if they fail to announce something in March or there was no March event,
[00:09:30.720 --> 00:09:32.480]   then stuff gets folded over to Dub Dub.
[00:09:32.480 --> 00:09:34.480]   Like in 2017, there was no March event.
[00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:37.280]   So we got like 18 different Macs, the iPad Pro, the HomePod,
[00:09:37.280 --> 00:09:39.200]   we got a ton of hardware at Dub Dub.
[00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:40.880]   But this year there was a March event.
[00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:43.440]   There also was no real indication that things were being like delayed,
[00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:45.520]   like other than the usual COVID related delays.
[00:09:45.520 --> 00:09:49.840]   And it sounds like Apple for whatever reason is having a hard time getting
[00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:52.080]   what they wanted out of this generation of chips.
[00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:58.160]   Taiwan semiconductors, four nanometer process is really five nanometer optimization level two,
[00:09:58.160 --> 00:10:00.400]   and their three nanometer process isn't ready on time.
[00:10:00.400 --> 00:10:03.920]   So what Apple was hoping for A16 and for M2 is just not going to,
[00:10:03.920 --> 00:10:05.600]   or M3 is not going to be there.
[00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:07.680]   So things are shifting.
[00:10:07.680 --> 00:10:09.520]   They could do it just to have something to announce.
[00:10:09.520 --> 00:10:12.080]   Like they did like a HomePod style announcement.
[00:10:12.080 --> 00:10:18.240]   So really, this is a caution to everybody,
[00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:20.400]   because I think the world certainly is saying,
[00:10:20.400 --> 00:10:23.120]   oh yeah, M2 MacBook Air is in color.
[00:10:23.120 --> 00:10:24.880]   Don't get, don't, don't, don't.
[00:10:24.880 --> 00:10:25.840]   Well, Shanghai closed.
[00:10:25.840 --> 00:10:27.760]   I mean, they literally closed.
[00:10:27.760 --> 00:10:28.480]   Yeah.
[00:10:28.480 --> 00:10:32.960]   But and also think about what does Apple gain by announcing these
[00:10:32.960 --> 00:10:38.800]   in the first week in June, as opposed to waiting for when people are
[00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:41.600]   almost jamming at the bit to go back to school.
[00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:45.280]   And if you wait for, if you wait until the end of the summer,
[00:10:45.280 --> 00:10:47.600]   you also get some more time to build up stock.
[00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:50.560]   You also get a little bit more attention,
[00:10:50.560 --> 00:10:53.760]   because that's the start of the spending money season.
[00:10:53.760 --> 00:10:57.680]   I mean, I could certainly see them actually releasing something next week,
[00:10:57.680 --> 00:11:00.960]   but I don't know what advantage that they would be giving themselves
[00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:05.920]   by doing that at WWDC, which is a keynote where the thrust is
[00:11:05.920 --> 00:11:08.800]   for developers and the thrust is an overall state of the union
[00:11:08.800 --> 00:11:10.800]   to the public about how Apple's doing.
[00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:16.560]   And I think that, you know, March is usually the education event.
[00:11:16.560 --> 00:11:18.800]   Like that's usually when they, because that's the cycle.
[00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:20.080]   By June, it's too late.
[00:11:20.080 --> 00:11:22.560]   You know, for any institutional purchasers to buy.
[00:11:22.560 --> 00:11:23.120]   Purchase order.
[00:11:23.120 --> 00:11:24.080]   So, yeah.
[00:11:24.080 --> 00:11:29.040]   So, I think that it's typically a, definitely focused on, again, developers.
[00:11:29.040 --> 00:11:33.840]   And forward, we could potentially see, again, some movement in USDZ,
[00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:38.880]   some movement in a wider range of that.
[00:11:38.880 --> 00:11:43.920]   And I think that AR IOS or AOS AR, AR, AR is.
[00:11:43.920 --> 00:11:45.760]   - ROS? - Whatever they call it.
[00:11:45.760 --> 00:11:46.240]   - ROS.
[00:11:46.240 --> 00:11:46.720]   - ROS.
[00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:46.720]   - ROS.
[00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:50.640]   - You know, I think that it could, you know, that potentially could come out.
[00:11:50.640 --> 00:11:55.760]   Again, potentially that can, you know, with simulators, or maybe they do talk about the
[00:11:55.760 --> 00:11:56.800]   fact that they're going to do some stuff.
[00:11:56.800 --> 00:11:58.320]   It's hard to know.
[00:11:58.320 --> 00:12:02.160]   You do want to, what's fair to developers or what you hope to do with developers is to give them,
[00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:07.040]   you know, time to think and to work on things.
[00:12:07.040 --> 00:12:11.600]   And I mean, I would give like a 5% chance that they actually released a developer edition of
[00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:15.440]   some new piece of hardware that costs $5,000.
[00:12:15.440 --> 00:12:19.200]   And, you know, and they'll sell as many as they can make at that price.
[00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:24.960]   And so I think that that potentially that could happen, but I would only give it a 5% or 10%
[00:12:24.960 --> 00:12:25.920]   chance.
[00:12:25.920 --> 00:12:32.160]   - Yeah. But what I said on Sunday during, during, during Twitch, I still sticks.
[00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:37.760]   I mean, I think that it's going to follow the same path as the Apple Watch did, as the iPhone
[00:12:37.760 --> 00:12:42.720]   did, as the iPad did, where there is a time at which they're going to have to make a public FCC
[00:12:42.720 --> 00:12:46.240]   filing, which they absolutely show everything that's going to go on anyway.
[00:12:46.240 --> 00:12:50.720]   So they're going to choose that week or that date to just show it off and give you the big dog
[00:12:50.720 --> 00:12:55.680]   and pony demo and then say this is going to be releasing like in, in, in, they'll show it off
[00:12:55.680 --> 00:13:00.000]   in January. They'll be, say they'll, they'll be releasing in June and they'll start seeding,
[00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:06.560]   they'll start seeding developers, selected developers in January so that during the big event
[00:13:06.560 --> 00:13:10.640]   where they actually launch it, they'll have lots of third party apps to write on stage to
[00:13:10.640 --> 00:13:11.680]   actually demonstrate it with.
[00:13:12.480 --> 00:13:18.800]   Because I would be really surprised if we saw, if we see any hardware this year, because it's,
[00:13:18.800 --> 00:13:22.960]   again, what's the, what's the advantage? That's not how Apple tends to work. I think, I think that
[00:13:22.960 --> 00:13:27.520]   there's going to be a lot of tea, tea, leaf reading, and all the sessions that come out,
[00:13:27.520 --> 00:13:31.120]   because I think that we're going to see a lot of, a lot of stuff where, hey, wow,
[00:13:31.120 --> 00:13:40.080]   here's a new 3D object or here's a new, here's a new system for prioritizing sensory input that,
[00:13:40.080 --> 00:13:45.600]   yes, I suppose you could use it for the time of flight sensor on a phone, but it actually makes
[00:13:45.600 --> 00:13:51.440]   more sense for a device that has not just one or two cameras, but say 10 to 14 cameras.
[00:13:51.440 --> 00:13:53.840]   And I think that's where we're going to see big phones.
[00:13:53.840 --> 00:13:57.520]   And it'll be interesting to see what kind of updates they do related to the software. I mean,
[00:13:57.520 --> 00:14:02.240]   I think that we're seeing Apple, I've been thinking about this in the last couple of weeks that,
[00:14:02.240 --> 00:14:06.480]   that, you know, a lot of the immersive stuff that Apple's doing and everything else really plays
[00:14:06.480 --> 00:14:12.480]   into the AR, VR, XR, you know, solutions that they've been doing very slowly. And so it'll be
[00:14:12.480 --> 00:14:18.640]   interesting to see, for instance, if we inside of, you know, reality creator, do we get 3D objects,
[00:14:18.640 --> 00:14:24.320]   when I say 3D objects, 3D objects in sound, you know, where if something's moving around you,
[00:14:24.320 --> 00:14:28.320]   Apple's doing the processing, because that's a real, what maybe Dolby's doing the processing
[00:14:28.320 --> 00:14:32.480]   that Apple has licensed from Dolby, but Dolby already has a lot of that built in for gameplay.
[00:14:33.200 --> 00:14:37.040]   So that's already built into some, there's some, you know, Unity builds and I think,
[00:14:37.040 --> 00:14:45.520]   anyways, other builds that are there. And so I think that Apple potentially could be doing more
[00:14:45.520 --> 00:14:50.400]   in that area, making it, I think that the interesting thing about dub dub, which I'm going to be
[00:14:50.400 --> 00:14:56.080]   really interested in the track, is Apple may not be trying to build a metaverse. It may be giving
[00:14:56.080 --> 00:15:00.960]   everybody else the tools to have a unified, build their own metaverse is on the Apple platform
[00:15:02.400 --> 00:15:09.120]   that allow across, you know, if everyone's using the same libraries, it gets into something that
[00:15:09.120 --> 00:15:14.240]   a lot of us talk about with metaverse. The problem is you can't move your character from one
[00:15:14.240 --> 00:15:19.280]   space to another. I can't go from Facebook to another space, but if Apple built the underlying
[00:15:19.280 --> 00:15:24.880]   architecture that everybody's sitting on, you could theoretically have a more unified experience
[00:15:24.880 --> 00:15:31.280]   across many people's development, which would, if I was at Facebook, I'd be very, very concerned
[00:15:31.280 --> 00:15:35.520]   if I saw that come up this week. The other thing that occurred to me is that Apple doesn't usually
[00:15:35.520 --> 00:15:40.800]   launch platforms at like new product categories at WWDC. Like Andy said, the iPhone and the iPod
[00:15:40.800 --> 00:15:45.280]   iPad were both January. The Apple Watch was September. The only one that's ever been at
[00:15:45.280 --> 00:15:50.720]   WWDC was 2017. And that was the HomePod. And the goal there was very different. The goal there was,
[00:15:50.720 --> 00:15:54.720]   it was like the same with the Apple Watch to agree is that there was immense pressure that Apple
[00:15:54.720 --> 00:15:59.600]   wasn't in this market. And by announcing a dub dub with it, with the idea of launching in the fall,
[00:15:59.600 --> 00:16:03.920]   they could Osborne, they could Osborne competitors, not themselves. And then maybe people would wait
[00:16:03.920 --> 00:16:07.920]   not buy something else because they knew Apple was coming out with this in time for the holidays.
[00:16:07.920 --> 00:16:11.760]   And then of course, famously, they had to go back and rebuild so many of the infrastructure
[00:16:11.760 --> 00:16:16.080]   points. They couldn't launch in the fall and it ended up being a spring launch. So they way
[00:16:16.080 --> 00:16:21.280]   over announced it. And I think they've grown a little bit leery of that. So my guess is like,
[00:16:21.280 --> 00:16:26.160]   there will be an event that actually shows off, like you can buy it now order today, order within
[00:16:26.160 --> 00:16:31.920]   two weeks, ships, whatever. And that will be six months after they do the Apple Watch or
[00:16:31.920 --> 00:16:36.240]   iPhone introductory thing, which is three weeks before it hits the FCC in the Eastern
[00:16:36.240 --> 00:16:43.920]   European. I'm also curious to see if they show us why that monitor that they're selling to us now
[00:16:43.920 --> 00:16:50.880]   has so much processing power and memory. It's very odd. And WWDC would be the time to show you like,
[00:16:50.880 --> 00:16:55.840]   Oh, by the way, you can actually turn this monitor into its own little machine. So
[00:16:55.840 --> 00:17:00.480]   that was another rumor, right? Like the Ross Young rumored that the big boy version, the big
[00:17:00.480 --> 00:17:05.440]   person version of that monitor, the mini LED version, which he says is 27 inches, but other
[00:17:05.440 --> 00:17:09.520]   people have said is bigger was supposed to be WWDC, but has been delayed again because of
[00:17:09.520 --> 00:17:13.120]   so much in the supply chain has been delayed to a fall launch now.
[00:17:13.120 --> 00:17:19.760]   I believe the speculation that that monitor is just they had some parts lying around and they
[00:17:19.760 --> 00:17:24.160]   threw them all together and they have no plans to do anything more than just the way Apple does
[00:17:24.160 --> 00:17:27.440]   it. Let's put some extra stuff in there for no reason for no. Well, they do it all the time,
[00:17:27.440 --> 00:17:33.920]   right? Right? Well, I would be more optimistic if it had Wi-Fi like the way the Samsungs does,
[00:17:33.920 --> 00:17:38.080]   right? Like if they had Wi-Fi in there, it would be so interesting. Like you could have an Airplay or
[00:17:38.080 --> 00:17:44.640]   continuity, like universal control device without a Mac, like you just come up, put your laptop
[00:17:44.640 --> 00:17:48.720]   down, not plug in a single thing, like go to Alex's office, like you go to your office Leo, stick
[00:17:48.720 --> 00:17:52.320]   on my books, be using it without having to let me do anything else. Like I just peer to peer
[00:17:52.320 --> 00:17:56.000]   and they just didn't do that, which I don't know if it was an oversight or deliberate or it's
[00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:59.440]   coming in a future version, but that would have been a super interesting product to me. This just
[00:17:59.440 --> 00:18:05.120]   feels like they needed something to offer iOS style features in the monitor and the cheapest way
[00:18:05.120 --> 00:18:10.240]   to do that was to slap iPad. You know, iPad, nothing, motherboards in it. I will bet you Alex
[00:18:10.240 --> 00:18:18.400]   Lindsay, this classic one button mouse that Apple will never ever at turn on any hardware
[00:18:18.400 --> 00:18:23.760]   features in that monitor. What you see is what you get and you say that they're going to know what
[00:18:23.760 --> 00:18:28.320]   I can bet. Is it an empty bed? What about pairing? They might add pairing Leo, stereo pairing, that
[00:18:28.320 --> 00:18:32.960]   would be nice because a bunch of nerds have two of them. Oh, come on, that's got to be the smallest
[00:18:32.960 --> 00:18:38.240]   market ever. And if you have two of these monitors, two of these overpriced monitors, our people
[00:18:38.240 --> 00:18:41.440]   Leo, it's our it's the people who watch the show who want it. They're the ones on on the
[00:18:41.440 --> 00:18:45.360]   one's what are asking. They've told us they want pairing. They want stereo pairing because they have
[00:18:45.360 --> 00:18:52.560]   two of them. A ken pod can do it. All right, it's only be fair. So I know Alex, you could bet that
[00:18:52.560 --> 00:18:59.280]   fancy monitor. I don't have I don't have the fancy one. Are you waiting to buy it until they give
[00:18:59.280 --> 00:19:04.960]   it more features? No, I'm not a very good monitor. Let's I mean, it's a it's I have a monitor.
[00:19:04.960 --> 00:19:10.880]   In addition to my iMac and my Wacom tablet, I have five monitors here. I don't need it
[00:19:10.880 --> 00:19:16.160]   right now. Like I just I just I'm just saturated at the moment. Yeah, saturated with monitors.
[00:19:16.160 --> 00:19:22.080]   Yeah, we have a show title. I have still no regrets that I canceled that order. But yeah,
[00:19:22.080 --> 00:19:26.560]   you know, maybe I will. Maybe I will on Monday. I'm actually thinking at this point, I could just
[00:19:26.560 --> 00:19:32.800]   skip Monday and it sounds like it's just kind of it's not going to be the most exciting if you
[00:19:32.800 --> 00:19:38.800]   expecting hardware. What what could they announce it would make me come in at 10 a.m. on a Monday
[00:19:38.800 --> 00:19:46.000]   morning? Lots of lots of into iOS. Sorry. Lots of exactly lots of updates to iPad OS, I think would
[00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:50.560]   be a really, really big deal. There's been a lot of rumblings about things that Apple is doing to
[00:19:50.560 --> 00:19:56.400]   improve the notebook like performance, the productivity performance of the iPad. And that would just be
[00:19:56.400 --> 00:20:01.360]   building strength upon strength. That has been inexplicable to me is that they they're software
[00:20:01.360 --> 00:20:08.960]   support for iPads power. I mean, it's an M1. It is an M it is a Mac, back book air in effect, right?
[00:20:08.960 --> 00:20:13.600]   But that's the whole Steve thing is that it was designed to be a computer for people for whom
[00:20:13.600 --> 00:20:18.720]   even the Mac was too inaccessible, alienating, intimidating. And he didn't like, like, he wants
[00:20:18.720 --> 00:20:22.720]   you to complain and say the Mac should be better. He doesn't want people to say just make the iPad
[00:20:22.720 --> 00:20:26.640]   a Mac. And I think that's slowly what's breaking down. Like there's a rumor from Steve Stratton Smith
[00:20:26.640 --> 00:20:31.600]   that WebKit has been updated to include multi windowing on its iPad version, which means
[00:20:31.600 --> 00:20:35.680]   you might start seeing that. But at what point do they just make it another Mac? And it becomes,
[00:20:35.680 --> 00:20:39.200]   again, like another computer that's inaccessible to the massive mainstream majority that it was
[00:20:39.200 --> 00:20:45.440]   actually designed for? Well, no, it's the iPad and all iOS devices I've always had. It's unique
[00:20:45.440 --> 00:20:52.160]   identity. It's almost like a Chromebook to compare it to a desktop, meaning that this is the one
[00:20:52.160 --> 00:20:56.400]   that is absolutely locked down. This is the one where you can't side load apps. This is the one
[00:20:56.400 --> 00:21:01.200]   where you can't just simply make it do absolutely everything you want to do. No, you can't have access
[00:21:01.200 --> 00:21:05.680]   to the raw file system. No, you can't have a terminal prompt. No, you can't necessarily,
[00:21:05.680 --> 00:21:11.680]   you can't do emulation. You can't, you can't build apps in whatever language you want on it.
[00:21:11.680 --> 00:21:16.400]   We'll let you do this one thing maybe with Swift, even there, we won't let you do everything on it.
[00:21:16.400 --> 00:21:21.920]   But in exchange, we will give you a platform that's a lot more stable. And also by throwing out stuff
[00:21:21.920 --> 00:21:25.920]   that is really, really tough to support at the kernel level, we will be able to make this thing
[00:21:25.920 --> 00:21:33.680]   thinner, lighter, more efficient, a lot cooler to run. And also it will be a damn nice tablet
[00:21:33.680 --> 00:21:39.680]   with a damn nice pencil. I mean, Apple, I don't think that Apple is so enamored with their
[00:21:39.680 --> 00:21:46.720]   industrial design to think that, no, no, no, people are spending $1,500 for an iPad because of the
[00:21:46.720 --> 00:21:51.120]   design, because it looks so good in the hand. No, it's because that they are convinced that they
[00:21:51.120 --> 00:21:58.480]   can deliver $1,500 with a value, i.e. the identical amount of value to almost any mid-range laptop
[00:21:58.480 --> 00:22:02.560]   you can buy from anyone, including Apple. And so the ability to do things like, well, one of the
[00:22:02.560 --> 00:22:07.600]   most interesting, I don't know if they could do multi-windling or dragable windows, resizable
[00:22:07.600 --> 00:22:14.400]   windows without kind of ruining the cleanliness of the experience. But I saw an interesting rumor
[00:22:14.400 --> 00:22:19.920]   that, so that one of the systems that Apple's testing is, it will, the iPad will operate the
[00:22:19.920 --> 00:22:25.920]   way that we understand it to normally. But if you do have a keyboard and a trackpad connected to it,
[00:22:25.920 --> 00:22:30.480]   then it will actually go let you suddenly pull windows apart and do stuff like that.
[00:22:30.480 --> 00:22:34.400]   Which would be interesting. Apple, Apple does a good job with, with the user experience,
[00:22:34.400 --> 00:22:39.280]   because they don't give us more than they think that the hardware and the experience can handle.
[00:22:39.280 --> 00:22:46.000]   And the, now that we can actually leave our homes occasionally, I'm getting, I'm getting as much use
[00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:50.720]   out of my iPad Pro that I bought last year as I hoped I would. It really is an exceptional
[00:22:50.720 --> 00:22:55.200]   experience. And if they could just, if they could make it even easier to do these kind of projects,
[00:22:55.200 --> 00:23:00.080]   I'd be all for it. So Alex, what would you like to see in an iPad OS that would make it
[00:23:00.080 --> 00:23:06.560]   live up to its potential? I take it that you feel like it doesn't yet.
[00:23:06.560 --> 00:23:11.280]   I'm, I'm pretty excited about the iPad. The only thing that I need from the iPad is,
[00:23:11.280 --> 00:23:16.880]   anyway, like, like, I, it does, like, I just need a lot. It's got a USB-C. It's got the transport to,
[00:23:16.880 --> 00:23:22.000]   what is that? By the way, is that C? So it's us, that C is USB 3.2. What is that?
[00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:27.120]   You're all different. Every iPad is different. Welcome to USB-C.
[00:23:27.120 --> 00:23:30.960]   Go from, they go from 0.5 on the mini all the way up to Thunderbolt on the Pro.
[00:23:30.960 --> 00:23:35.680]   So on the Pro, if you have an iPad Pro 12.9 or 11, the latest, that's the other,
[00:23:35.680 --> 00:23:38.480]   yeah, Thunderbolt 3. Yeah. So, what do you give us for a second?
[00:23:39.120 --> 00:23:44.080]   I just want support for, if I plug a Blackmagic Ultra Studio into it or a Elgato,
[00:23:44.080 --> 00:23:48.720]   CamLink or whatever, I want to see a live video. I want that to be a service that is available
[00:23:48.720 --> 00:23:53.840]   into it. So I think that that, for me, that's the biggest thing missing for my iPad because
[00:23:53.840 --> 00:23:58.400]   it's mostly, I know it's very mundane, but it's mostly so I can do this. You're drawing my screen.
[00:23:58.400 --> 00:24:01.280]   You know, like, I can draw on my iPad. I can't do that right now.
[00:24:01.280 --> 00:24:05.600]   You can't, right now, attach a camera, an external camera to the iPad without the camera,
[00:24:05.600 --> 00:24:09.440]   connection kit and USB. You can't just plug. That's how we want to do it.
[00:24:09.440 --> 00:24:13.520]   Even, even, even, I want to have HD video into it. HD video in, yeah, right.
[00:24:13.520 --> 00:24:17.520]   When that's a frame to second. Yeah, cool. And you could do, there's all kinds of effects and
[00:24:17.520 --> 00:24:21.120]   everything else. You know, there's so many things that could be done. I could put an 8-10 mini in
[00:24:21.120 --> 00:24:25.440]   front of it and then I could have, you know, be cutting shows and seeing what I'm doing here.
[00:24:25.440 --> 00:24:29.200]   It would be transformational. I like it. And so for that, for me, that's the big, I mean,
[00:24:29.200 --> 00:24:32.880]   as far as what I want to see it, I mean, there's lots of things I want to see at WWBC, but what I
[00:24:32.880 --> 00:24:37.360]   want to see from an iPad is just videoing. There have been rumors, they'll be like,
[00:24:37.360 --> 00:24:40.800]   I mean, and the prices have been cut for the AirPods. Maybe there'll be some AirPods.
[00:24:40.800 --> 00:24:46.560]   I'm just trying to mop with it. AirPods. AirPods. AirPods aren't hard-wearing. Again, I think that-
[00:24:46.560 --> 00:24:51.760]   No hardware. No hardware. No hardware. I mean, I will say that, I say this, I think I say this
[00:24:51.760 --> 00:24:58.640]   every year now. If they add USDZ to keynote, it is going to create such a cottage industry because
[00:24:59.680 --> 00:25:02.960]   I'm just, you know, like I just, if they add it, I don't even know if they're going to add it anymore.
[00:25:02.960 --> 00:25:09.120]   I'm kind of giving up. But I think that if they add it, what happens is that everybody wants
[00:25:09.120 --> 00:25:15.280]   basically clip art in 3D and it will create such a massive market for building, like,
[00:25:15.280 --> 00:25:18.960]   it's not going to build a massive market for building $250 objects. It's going to be like 25
[00:25:18.960 --> 00:25:24.480]   objects for 10 bucks, you know, and you can buy them and now you've got a bunch of things for school
[00:25:24.480 --> 00:25:29.040]   and a bunch of things for business and a bunch of things for other, you know, and it'll be in-
[00:25:29.040 --> 00:25:33.760]   I just think it'll be explosive, you know, and it will change the way the real problem will be is
[00:25:33.760 --> 00:25:39.040]   that nothing, no other presentation tool will be able to do what it's doing. And so, you know,
[00:25:39.040 --> 00:25:43.520]   and I think that- and I think that that's not minor. Like, I do a lot of- we build a lot of decks.
[00:25:43.520 --> 00:25:49.040]   And the main thing is being able to have an object while you're talking. Like, I do things
[00:25:49.040 --> 00:25:52.720]   where I have things I'm trying to describe as most of my decks are demonstrative. You know,
[00:25:52.720 --> 00:25:57.840]   I'm showing how something works. Not- I'm not trying to sell anybody anything. And the-
[00:25:57.840 --> 00:26:03.520]   you know, being able to rotate it around, zoom in on it, all that stuff inside of my-
[00:26:03.520 --> 00:26:09.040]   inside of my deck is a big deal. I will put USDZ and keynote on my bingo card
[00:26:09.040 --> 00:26:12.480]   just so that I can cheer for you. Yay! I think that's it.
[00:26:12.480 --> 00:26:18.800]   I'd like to see my book areas. I just thought he was not going to get my hopes up.
[00:26:19.280 --> 00:26:22.400]   Yeah. So is that what's- okay, now be honest.
[00:26:22.400 --> 00:26:26.560]   Is that really what's going on Renee? Is you're just tamping it down because you don't want
[00:26:26.560 --> 00:26:29.520]   to be disappointed when they don't announce it. Oh no, so like it's- you don't cover it.
[00:26:29.520 --> 00:26:34.720]   I get really excited about the software. Like the idea- this stuff hits billions of people.
[00:26:34.720 --> 00:26:38.000]   You don't have to buy anything. No, that's true. For like 10 years of-
[00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:43.040]   I can just ridiculous how far back it goes. Like last year, the original iPhone SE was still
[00:26:43.040 --> 00:26:47.600]   included in the update cycle. So like for- for like a billion people, you were getting like a
[00:26:47.600 --> 00:26:51.120]   fresh port of paint on your phone, your tablet. You don't have to spend an extra cent.
[00:26:51.120 --> 00:26:54.320]   It's new features. They're- they're like- the last couple of years have been interesting
[00:26:54.320 --> 00:26:58.560]   features. So I think Apple had to curve in order to lean in to remote work and to things like
[00:26:58.560 --> 00:27:02.160]   SharePlay and all these other things that I don't think they anticipated. So I think that
[00:27:02.160 --> 00:27:05.840]   got a little bit money there. But just the idea that they can do these things, they can add these
[00:27:05.840 --> 00:27:10.560]   things and suddenly like you get it in the beta and it's like a whole new phone. I- I- I fall
[00:27:10.560 --> 00:27:14.640]   deeply in love with software engineering every- that's a really- they're- well- well- said.
[00:27:14.640 --> 00:27:19.040]   That's a point that we overlook. We focus so much on what's the new toys that really-
[00:27:19.040 --> 00:27:21.600]   the software benefits everybody. That's a very, very-
[00:27:21.600 --> 00:27:24.160]   Makes all the toys better. Makes all the toys better. I- okay.
[00:27:24.160 --> 00:27:28.480]   And I'll pay attention to software then. And in addition- in addition to looking forward to
[00:27:28.480 --> 00:27:32.480]   what's- what's kind of- what's came up in iPadOS, iOS, watch OS, Mac OS.
[00:27:32.480 --> 00:27:38.320]   The- in the past two or three years, it's just been just as exciting to find out
[00:27:39.120 --> 00:27:45.360]   what have they added to the ecosystem to make the iPad and the Mac and the watch and the phone
[00:27:45.360 --> 00:27:51.280]   work better together. Like I would like- I would love nothing more than for- to have
[00:27:51.280 --> 00:27:57.440]   official developers- developer support for- for the use of an iPad or a phone as an input device.
[00:27:57.440 --> 00:28:02.720]   The- the touch bar was an interesting idea that was absolutely not capitalized upon in any way,
[00:28:02.720 --> 00:28:07.840]   shape or form by Apple. But if they could simply say, "Here- the- the desktop user you're going to
[00:28:07.840 --> 00:28:12.720]   face for Photoshop or whatever is what it is. It'll work just absolutely great and fine."
[00:28:12.720 --> 00:28:17.840]   But if you- if you're one of those rare Mac owners who also has an iPhone, you can also put a-
[00:28:17.840 --> 00:28:21.520]   you can also put a scroll wheel on that, or you can put a color palette on that thing,
[00:28:21.520 --> 00:28:26.240]   or you can use it as an input tablet and we will have an overlay of your- of your photo on it.
[00:28:26.240 --> 00:28:33.040]   That's a- it's- it's- it's one of the reasons why I- again, freelance journalist in a rapidly
[00:28:33.040 --> 00:28:36.400]   collapsing market, I did blink and hesitate. Of course looking at-
[00:28:36.400 --> 00:28:37.760]   [crosstalk]
[00:28:37.760 --> 00:28:42.720]   But before- before clicking that button and buying, spending like $1400, $1500 on that iPad Pro,
[00:28:42.720 --> 00:28:47.680]   but one of the things that made me confident was knowing that it won't just be an iPad,
[00:28:47.680 --> 00:28:51.360]   the way an iPad was five or six years ago. It's going to be an accessory that will
[00:28:51.360 --> 00:28:55.760]   enhance how I use my Mac and it's- that's absolutely been true so far. So that's part of what you're
[00:28:55.760 --> 00:28:59.840]   investing in- in Apple. There's a lock-in, but there's supposed to be a benefit to it and this-
[00:28:59.840 --> 00:29:05.440]   this interoperability and these ways of one piece of hardware enhancing another piece of hardware
[00:29:05.440 --> 00:29:09.360]   and making new things possible, that's one of the benefits we're getting from lock-in.
[00:29:09.360 --> 00:29:13.200]   And it's so wild that like AirPods get updates now. Like for the last two
[00:29:13.200 --> 00:29:17.920]   WWDCs, AirPods got update two years ago, they got spatial audio, last year they got conversation,
[00:29:17.920 --> 00:29:21.200]   boost and find my- it's like we're living in this computational world where like the
[00:29:21.200 --> 00:29:25.680]   software touches so many of the products we already have. Yeah. Well, if you were lucky enough to get
[00:29:25.680 --> 00:29:32.960]   win the lottery and get an invite to Apple Park on Monday, let's just- not- not necessarily
[00:29:32.960 --> 00:29:37.680]   anybody here, but just of those of you who were watching. Let's just take a look
[00:29:37.680 --> 00:29:45.280]   according to Paul Hudson at Two Straws on Twitter. And what- what- what you'll be in for
[00:29:45.280 --> 00:29:52.400]   you've got- you've got of course the keynote, but before that check in at 7 a.m. for a lovely
[00:29:52.400 --> 00:29:59.920]   Apple Developer Center open house and then breakfast at 8 a.m. at Cafe Max,
[00:30:00.480 --> 00:30:04.560]   which Apple spells correctly with two Fs. Just want to point that out.
[00:30:04.560 --> 00:30:10.240]   You're a Francophone. You appreciate that. That's a nice cafe too. Like the one at Apple Park,
[00:30:10.240 --> 00:30:17.040]   they had one at IL at the Infinite Loop and then they built another one just down the street
[00:30:17.040 --> 00:30:22.000]   that was like much more modern and had like a lot more like walk around area. And that was like the
[00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:26.240]   people covered it like some super secret Apple Cafe, but it was really like a test bed for Apple
[00:30:26.240 --> 00:30:30.720]   Park and now they've built that out where it's about like these huge opening doors and- the
[00:30:30.720 --> 00:30:36.880]   last video that I was at which is 10 years ago that was like cold Danish and bad coffee. Is it
[00:30:36.880 --> 00:30:40.960]   better these days? I think it is. Oh, I mean, so I still get people still copy me when they've
[00:30:40.960 --> 00:30:44.320]   served bad putty in there, which I find hilarious. Like I've got such a repeat- at least they have
[00:30:44.320 --> 00:30:48.960]   putty to include me on the complaint for them. Bad two putty in is better than no putty.
[00:30:48.960 --> 00:30:52.480]   Or maybe not. But it's the- yeah, no, they throw a long time like Steve Jobs flew in his
[00:30:52.480 --> 00:30:56.720]   favorite sushi chef and said he wanted to make sushi. They got like- build a burrito bars.
[00:30:56.720 --> 00:30:59.920]   Oh man, that's why they stopped inviting me. The food was too good. That was that old joke.
[00:30:59.920 --> 00:31:02.880]   Remember like Steve would pay for Scott Forest Hall's lunch every day and Scott's like,
[00:31:02.880 --> 00:31:07.280]   "Steve, let me pay for it." He's like, "Scott, I make one dollar a year. I tap with my badge. I
[00:31:07.280 --> 00:31:11.840]   have no idea who's paying for all these free lunches." He's like a billionaire scamming for
[00:31:11.840 --> 00:31:16.800]   scamming Apple for free lunch. Free lunch, man. Kena Scott was getting the burrito. It took longer
[00:31:16.800 --> 00:31:21.840]   than Steve Souss. Kena note in Apple Park at 10 a.m. although Scooter X corrected me. I said 2000.
[00:31:21.840 --> 00:31:26.880]   I said, "Sizemas, I thought I read that in Tripp Meckel's book. It is a 1000 seat. But just know,
[00:31:26.880 --> 00:31:32.960]   when you're sitting in that fine leather seat that it's cost him $14,000 to make. After the Kena-
[00:31:32.960 --> 00:31:39.040]   Tower plugs at the bottom of them. Yes. So you can plug in your Windows machine. After-
[00:31:39.040 --> 00:31:43.280]   because you don't need to plug in an M1, right? That's only Lance Woodmock. He sits on going
[00:31:43.280 --> 00:31:47.520]   there with a Surface every year. Does he really? That's hysterical. Yeah. It's like a sea of apple
[00:31:47.520 --> 00:31:53.120]   computer than Lance on his Surface. It's amazing. Oh, Lord. So he still gets invited, huh?
[00:31:53.120 --> 00:31:59.360]   Noon lunch at Cafe Max once again. I know that's boring, but you know.
[00:31:59.360 --> 00:32:05.920]   Platforms state of the union 1 p.m. then now it's very important you can meet the teams
[00:32:05.920 --> 00:32:11.680]   from 230 on. But it's very important that you choose your tour because they're all at the same
[00:32:11.680 --> 00:32:17.040]   time. This is kind of like booking cruise excursions. You've got to pick. You can tour the Apple
[00:32:17.040 --> 00:32:22.320]   Park Hills. Is that like, I mean, what does that mean? Is that actual hills that you're going to?
[00:32:22.320 --> 00:32:25.920]   It's like an arboreal tour. It's like they have a bunch of little rolling hillsides with a bunch
[00:32:25.920 --> 00:32:29.040]   of vegetation that they've been planting. They had like a tree master there. They're really going
[00:32:29.040 --> 00:32:32.560]   to first open. I don't know what it is now, but stuff was still growing then. But they have a bunch
[00:32:32.560 --> 00:32:38.080]   of regional plants and you know, their the arboreal team is very excited about the fauna that they
[00:32:38.080 --> 00:32:42.080]   have. Or, and I don't know why you would do this, you could tour the fitness center.
[00:32:43.280 --> 00:32:49.040]   That sounds really awful. Or tour cafe max, which you've already been to twice today. So
[00:32:49.040 --> 00:32:54.400]   I'm thinking the Apple Park Hills, if I happen to have one of those golden tickets, that's where
[00:32:54.400 --> 00:32:59.360]   I'd be going. But you know, that's up to you. Oh, you know, it's, you know, you know, you know,
[00:32:59.360 --> 00:33:03.760]   I know where you're going cafe. You're going to the top. See what I'm saying is that it would cost me
[00:33:03.760 --> 00:33:10.480]   like $1,200 all in to be there at the to be there at the event. There's for that amount of money.
[00:33:10.480 --> 00:33:15.360]   Free. I am bringing a whole, I know I'm bringing a whole box of like ziplock freezer bags and
[00:33:15.360 --> 00:33:20.800]   there you go. I'm gonna line every pocket in my jacket and I am going out there with four days
[00:33:20.800 --> 00:33:28.320]   worth of meals. I just want to point out, I never did that. Okay. And then I should have now if I
[00:33:28.320 --> 00:33:33.680]   know I would have factor that in. They expect to lose, you know, a couple of lamps, you know,
[00:33:33.680 --> 00:33:42.720]   all the cold Danish, I could carry. Finally, at 4.30 pm, which is, you know, not exactly an evening
[00:33:42.720 --> 00:33:49.440]   event, you can go to the Apple Design Awards and you're all invited to that. So what a busy, busy day,
[00:33:49.440 --> 00:33:57.120]   those lucky few, the proud, you think it's more than a thousand? The thousand seats are inside.
[00:33:57.120 --> 00:34:00.800]   You think they'll have an overflow? I don't know if it's going to be at the Steve Jobs series. I
[00:34:00.800 --> 00:34:04.720]   really think they're going to do something again. It was just a rumor under the room. I forget
[00:34:04.720 --> 00:34:09.680]   you know, I said the rumor, it might have been rumor, but like there's a row of buildings that
[00:34:09.680 --> 00:34:13.840]   because the apple park is in the middle and then you have a street all around it and apple has
[00:34:13.840 --> 00:34:17.280]   buildings all around it. And one of the rumors and it might have been Gruber said that there's a
[00:34:17.280 --> 00:34:21.680]   building right across from the visitor center that apple could be transforming into an actual
[00:34:21.680 --> 00:34:25.200]   developer center, not just for dub dub, but like going forward because they have developers
[00:34:25.200 --> 00:34:28.640]   coming in and out all the time, like especially back in the old days, you surrender developer
[00:34:28.640 --> 00:34:32.480]   kitchens all the time out of infinite loop where you'd come in even like before hardware.
[00:34:32.480 --> 00:34:36.000]   They have developers demonstrate stuff when the new apple watch is announced on the new
[00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:39.760]   iPhone. They've been in there for a couple of weeks under lock and key working on that stuff
[00:34:39.760 --> 00:34:43.920]   with apple evangelists and engineers and things. So there could be a real thing to have like an
[00:34:43.920 --> 00:34:49.600]   apple developer center and it could debut at the event. Does anybody have any information on
[00:34:49.600 --> 00:34:54.560]   whether there's going to be a mask mandate there or a vaccination mandate? I've heard there would
[00:34:54.560 --> 00:34:59.840]   be someone tweeted the I think it might have been Paul, the same Paul who tweeted that
[00:34:59.840 --> 00:35:05.840]   might have been tweeting that there's testing and masking required. Yeah, because I was I was
[00:35:05.840 --> 00:35:10.000]   wondering if part of me was thinking that maybe they'll set up an outdoor tent just to make things
[00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:14.720]   a little bit safer. But on the other hand, I'm thinking that if they if the Steve Jobs Theater had
[00:35:14.720 --> 00:35:19.760]   not been fitted with really, really good filtration systems at the outset, I bet that they have retro
[00:35:19.760 --> 00:35:25.840]   fit really good filtration and air movement since then. Still, it's it might be
[00:35:25.840 --> 00:35:35.600]   Yeah, it's it might be after GDC. Yeah, exactly. It's it's that there's something about seeing if
[00:35:35.600 --> 00:35:40.880]   you when you see people in a conventional auditorium like this one where every seat is
[00:35:40.880 --> 00:35:45.760]   supposedly going to be filled, you kind of like to see a requirement that everybody has a mask on
[00:35:45.760 --> 00:35:51.040]   and a and a safety video with with with with forest all demonstrating that you're supposed to put
[00:35:51.040 --> 00:35:56.640]   it above the nose. You want it to be more like severance than not at that point. Here's a here's
[00:35:56.640 --> 00:36:02.560]   a beard bag for those of you who have who have a need for the beard bag. I don't even want to
[00:36:02.560 --> 00:36:08.000]   know what a beard bag is. I don't want to know that there there are there are special there are
[00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:13.280]   different mask designs for people who have like full beers. Okay, I want to I want to talk about the
[00:36:13.280 --> 00:36:19.360]   the double double dal rumple. Yeah, have you seen the singing mask that they built for the opera?
[00:36:19.360 --> 00:36:23.600]   Oh, I really want to go to a event with that. I have one. I don't know. It's not right in front
[00:36:23.600 --> 00:36:30.000]   of me. I got it. That's that's the problem. I know people get big duck. I have two right.
[00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:35.040]   I have I have friends who actually work at the Met and it's like one of them
[00:36:35.040 --> 00:36:39.520]   one of them got covid because they rehearse in masks, but on stage they
[00:36:40.240 --> 00:36:44.160]   got to be singing right next to each other in character anyway. So that's why they have such a
[00:36:44.160 --> 00:36:48.800]   strict policy of they don't even care about a positive test. If you even just have a sniffle,
[00:36:48.800 --> 00:36:50.880]   guess what? You're out for two weeks. Does it look like this?
[00:36:50.880 --> 00:36:58.480]   No way bigger. It's way bigger. It's like a huge duck bill. It's like, yeah, it's like, it's like
[00:36:58.480 --> 00:37:04.880]   it's like a big because you don't this is a this is a N95 from think Kimberly Clark, but you don't
[00:37:04.880 --> 00:37:09.120]   it doesn't touch your your mouth or your lips. Yeah, that's a really cool one. It's a good one.
[00:37:09.120 --> 00:37:13.680]   No, I know. It's not like a like a from Juliet. It looks a little bit like a whole duck.
[00:37:13.680 --> 00:37:18.320]   But but it's better because the one that the one that the one that we've learned, you know,
[00:37:18.320 --> 00:37:22.480]   we just did an interview with someone who does covid research and they're like, yeah, the cloth
[00:37:22.480 --> 00:37:26.720]   ones are worthless. He just like bled out. He was like, yeah, he's like, yeah, I mean,
[00:37:26.720 --> 00:37:31.280]   it was better than nothing. I guess. Hey, I wore him. I made him. I never got so it worked.
[00:37:31.280 --> 00:37:35.600]   He said it was better. He said it was actually what he said was, is it better than nothing,
[00:37:35.600 --> 00:37:41.680]   but not much. Well, I found like, I thought it was really Eric. Some was when like after like
[00:37:41.680 --> 00:37:46.080]   you saw GDC and you saw packs and a couple other events and people got covid afterwards.
[00:37:46.080 --> 00:37:49.360]   And then people were like, yeah, I went I had covid didn't wear a mask, but I didn't want to
[00:37:49.360 --> 00:37:55.280]   miss out. Anyway, and you're just like, I don't want to in a crowd of 1000 people, you're going
[00:37:55.280 --> 00:38:00.160]   to have a few people like that. So like I think the safety, the safety is warranted.
[00:38:00.160 --> 00:38:04.560]   It was with the government sending them to us anytime I go to a large event, I just test.
[00:38:04.560 --> 00:38:06.320]   Absolutely. I just like, I'll just test myself.
[00:38:06.320 --> 00:38:12.480]   Yeah. Just just a just a very quick post group before really that topic. I have I've had three
[00:38:12.480 --> 00:38:17.920]   friends in the past two or three weeks get test positive. Some of them, it's not just some of them
[00:38:17.920 --> 00:38:22.640]   are it's oh well, geez, I've been triple vax and I feel a little bit under the weather, but it's
[00:38:22.640 --> 00:38:28.560]   like a little cold. One of them is again has been quadruple vax and it's like she had a couple of
[00:38:28.560 --> 00:38:32.480]   good days and then she was fighting her back for a day starting to recover a little bit the next
[00:38:32.480 --> 00:38:35.840]   day. So don't think that just because you're a vax is this is a solved problem.
[00:38:35.840 --> 00:38:40.160]   Absolutely not. I'm quadruple of acts, but I'm still wearing my mask.
[00:38:40.160 --> 00:38:46.080]   Yeah. Hey, any before we leave the real topic of the day, which is WWDC and again,
[00:38:46.080 --> 00:38:53.760]   this Monday, so the next time we gather, we will know the answers. Anything else? We'll see iOS 16.
[00:38:53.760 --> 00:38:56.960]   We'll see a Mac OS,
[00:38:56.960 --> 00:39:01.600]   13, whatever is next right after Monterey Mammoth.
[00:39:01.600 --> 00:39:02.480]   Mac OS 13.
[00:39:02.480 --> 00:39:07.760]   Mac OS 13. And those will be for fall delivery, presumably as always.
[00:39:07.760 --> 00:39:12.240]   I pad OS 16, TVOS 16, watch OS 9 and maybe reality OS 1.
[00:39:12.240 --> 00:39:15.120]   And one hopes that they will go through those and talk about new features.
[00:39:15.120 --> 00:39:21.840]   They did drop another beta today, I think, which was kind of a high velocity drop.
[00:39:21.840 --> 00:39:26.640]   Yeah. So maybe the next next iteration is going to go. The next iteration of the release versions
[00:39:26.640 --> 00:39:30.160]   are going to come up next one. One of the analysts says now that a billion people,
[00:39:30.160 --> 00:39:36.560]   one billion people use Safari on both Mac OS and iOS. So and usually they'll announce Safari
[00:39:36.560 --> 00:39:41.840]   updates kind of as a separate thing because so many people use it. So that'll be interesting as well.
[00:39:41.840 --> 00:39:42.000]   Yeah.
[00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:42.480]   Yeah.
[00:39:42.480 --> 00:39:45.440]   A platform. The web is like the set, the unspoken platform.
[00:39:45.440 --> 00:39:51.840]   But if we do not want to be disappointed, we should just stick with that. Stick with software.
[00:39:51.840 --> 00:39:55.520]   And the other big thing is like, I see this so often on Twitter and it's really bewildering to me.
[00:39:55.520 --> 00:40:01.040]   It's like reads every leak, then says it's boring, then says there was no surprises and then gets
[00:40:01.040 --> 00:40:04.960]   angry. Yeah, I know. If I read the script to Star Wars and then I go watch it, I won't like,
[00:40:04.960 --> 00:40:07.680]   and it's not surprising. That's that's on me. Right.
[00:40:07.680 --> 00:40:10.880]   Like I'm grown as adult. I have that choice. So so folks,
[00:40:10.880 --> 00:40:16.240]   the leaks are don't. We're trying to dampen your spirits. No, we're trying to dampen your
[00:40:16.240 --> 00:40:21.840]   expectations. Apple will dampen your spirits on Monday and we'll all be here for it. And of course,
[00:40:21.840 --> 00:40:25.520]   you'll have your choice three different ways. Well, there's probably many, many more, but you can
[00:40:25.520 --> 00:40:30.720]   always watch Apple's own stream. I guess is it still HLS only? You have to use a Safari?
[00:40:30.720 --> 00:40:37.600]   No, you can watch it. You can watch it on on Android and PC's. It'll. Okay. So watch it on
[00:40:37.600 --> 00:40:43.280]   YouTube. If you want to watch our coverage, we do not go on YouTube because we don't want Apple
[00:40:43.280 --> 00:40:49.600]   to get mad at us. So you can watch our stream in other places, you know, where office hours.global,
[00:40:49.600 --> 00:40:53.920]   of course, you'll be doing your own YouTube and you are on YouTube and you did not get pulled down,
[00:40:53.920 --> 00:40:59.120]   but you don't show the keynote, right? You just look at it. Our is the most complicated pipeline
[00:40:59.120 --> 00:41:03.920]   to cover the show. So we're still assuming that you're watching it somewhere else. Right. So
[00:41:03.920 --> 00:41:09.440]   basically what we're doing is two screens to do this. The panelists, the panelists are going to
[00:41:09.440 --> 00:41:16.080]   hear the keynote and see it in our zoom window. But you'll only hear us talking about it. So,
[00:41:16.640 --> 00:41:21.520]   so it's it is a it's a second. It's truly a second year experience. The reason we have to do that
[00:41:21.520 --> 00:41:25.120]   is because otherwise the panelists get it at different times and someone's like, yeah, and we're
[00:41:25.120 --> 00:41:29.120]   like, why? He's just finished. He's not a smart one. Yeah, because so so we noticed this, you know,
[00:41:29.120 --> 00:41:33.040]   we'll be watching our chat room. We're watching the stream. The chat room knows already what's
[00:41:33.040 --> 00:41:38.720]   going to be announced and suddenly and it can make if I wanted to, but I try not to make me look
[00:41:38.720 --> 00:41:43.360]   very smart saying, you know, I think this is going to be $7.99. It is. What is shot?
[00:41:44.880 --> 00:41:49.920]   I'm not in my living in the future. But then there's a YouTube drama video, Leo saying you're
[00:41:49.920 --> 00:41:56.080]   cheating. Yeah, the poor cheating it up to see bingo. God. Oh, God. Yeah. So so anyway, so that's
[00:41:56.080 --> 00:41:59.280]   that's that's how we're going to do it. Good. We'll see how it goes. Office hours at global.
[00:41:59.280 --> 00:42:03.760]   And then of course, others, I'm sure, we'll be streaming it there. Do people still do live blogs?
[00:42:03.760 --> 00:42:08.160]   I guess it doesn't make quite as much sense if you're not in the room and there is a stream. I think
[00:42:08.160 --> 00:42:13.280]   the verge did, but I think they still do it. Yeah. It's kind of old school. I like it. I should do
[00:42:13.280 --> 00:42:17.520]   it from a phone booth. Well, some people are at work and they can't watch a video or listen to it.
[00:42:17.520 --> 00:42:21.760]   So they like having little text updates going by. Yeah. Oh, that's Mac rumors. I think does it on
[00:42:21.760 --> 00:42:27.760]   Twitter. They do it a whole Twitter room events or something. Cool. All right. And Jason does it.
[00:42:27.760 --> 00:42:31.440]   Jason and Dan, I believe still this is it. This is it. We're not going to talk about anymore.
[00:42:31.440 --> 00:42:36.800]   Last chance. Put in your bids, which should be on the bingo card. We've got the USD Z
[00:42:37.760 --> 00:42:44.000]   in keynote for Alex. I'm still holding that hope for an M2 MacBook Air, but I know I'm wrong.
[00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:49.840]   Renee's saying it might happen. All the software. And you know, the real bingo card,
[00:42:49.840 --> 00:42:53.520]   oh, well, the real bingo card is the friends we make along the way. But the other real bingo card
[00:42:53.520 --> 00:42:59.280]   is Tim Cook saying good morning and innovation and Craig making a joke about the crack marketing
[00:42:59.280 --> 00:43:03.760]   team and whether Eddie or Jaws has the best shirt. You know, and there's a whole bunch of like just
[00:43:03.760 --> 00:43:07.920]   meta stuff that we met a meta for those who've watched many keynotes. How they're going to
[00:43:07.920 --> 00:43:13.440]   screw over Facebook for a third year in a row with policy policy. We can also think about like
[00:43:13.440 --> 00:43:19.600]   what the what the name of the next OS is going to be. And to see which if once again, they chose
[00:43:19.600 --> 00:43:24.960]   the name based on his comedy potential for the keynote. Oh, interesting. Like remember OS 10
[00:43:24.960 --> 00:43:32.080]   weed and yeah, Rancho Cucamonga. Yeah. I saw somebody said, mamice. I like mamice. OS 10 bottom.
[00:43:32.080 --> 00:43:37.760]   Hey, if you're about to pull this one right out of our oops.
[00:43:37.760 --> 00:43:43.200]   They could have had Dre announced OS 10 South Central. I never did. That was a total waste of
[00:43:43.200 --> 00:43:49.600]   opportunity. That'd be good. Yeah. Our Dre and Jimmy Iovino long gone from Apple Park. Yes.
[00:43:49.600 --> 00:43:56.400]   They are spending time with their money. Yeah. Oh my god. That is worth that whole that whole
[00:43:56.400 --> 00:44:01.360]   story's worth reading. It's all over. Olivier took over from Eddie's lieutenant who used to manage
[00:44:01.360 --> 00:44:06.720]   iTunes all outside of the US. Oliver Schuss something I'm blanking on his last name. He took over for
[00:44:06.720 --> 00:44:11.760]   Eddie as the creative sort of director for that. Funny thing I was talking to someone at Beats
[00:44:11.760 --> 00:44:16.640]   in engineering at one time and they said, yeah, we thought we knew a lot about audio. Like we were
[00:44:16.640 --> 00:44:21.280]   going to bring show Apple how to do audio for headsets and everything else. And then we met
[00:44:21.280 --> 00:44:26.240]   their team and they were like, I don't even know why they bought us. Like the team was so far ahead
[00:44:26.240 --> 00:44:31.120]   of them that they were thinking about things that we hadn't even imagined. They were getting
[00:44:31.120 --> 00:44:37.120]   they were working and but the brand and the and the and a lot of the bits and pieces there were
[00:44:37.120 --> 00:44:43.120]   useful the contracts with the Jimmy Cashier. Yeah. And the cashier. Yeah. It was it was a very
[00:44:43.120 --> 00:44:47.920]   successful merger but but it was. Yeah. In hindsight, it was I thought it was really dumb. And in the
[00:44:47.920 --> 00:44:51.920]   trip, Mickle book, you know, you're really kind of say, well, this really didn't this was coo-goo.
[00:44:51.920 --> 00:44:55.920]   They made a lot of money with it. Yeah. Turned out. They turned out. It was definitely cash
[00:44:55.920 --> 00:45:02.160]   a cash positive. Yeah. I want to show you the most comfortable earbuds made today. And these
[00:45:02.160 --> 00:45:06.880]   are my ultimate years and I highly recommend them for years. I've worn ultimate ears that are
[00:45:06.880 --> 00:45:12.160]   molded. I have to go to an audiologist. They mold. They they make the thing. These are very,
[00:45:12.160 --> 00:45:18.240]   very expensive. The kind of headphones that you know, rock stars where you see. But this is in a way,
[00:45:18.240 --> 00:45:24.080]   an inexpensive way to get the same comfort. Very much of the same fit. It's ultimate ears,
[00:45:24.080 --> 00:45:30.480]   UE fits are showed today brought to you by Ultimate Ears Fits. And I love these. If I want to wear
[00:45:30.480 --> 00:45:36.560]   my earbuds for a long time, this is what I wear. They fit into my ear very similarly to my in-ear
[00:45:36.560 --> 00:45:42.000]   monitors. But they do all the things that you know, fancy headphones do. They have, you know,
[00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:47.600]   you can have Siri in here. You can have your Google Assistant. Let me show you. We actually,
[00:45:47.600 --> 00:45:54.720]   when I got these, we did the process of fitting in my UE fits. You open the box and they're sealed
[00:45:54.720 --> 00:45:59.520]   because as soon as they're exposed to air, they they start doing something kind of magical. They
[00:45:59.520 --> 00:46:06.800]   start molding to your ear. They use light to do it. So you unseal the fits and you put them in your
[00:46:06.800 --> 00:46:16.240]   ear and you get in 60 seconds, no audiologist required a perfect fit. It fits so well, they stay
[00:46:16.240 --> 00:46:20.000]   put when you're on the go. Okay, so I'm going to put them in the ear now, press the button.
[00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:25.520]   And a blue light comes on. They warm up a little bit. They warm up a little bit as they're molding
[00:46:25.520 --> 00:46:32.560]   themselves. They're contouring themselves to your ear. I love this using something they call
[00:46:32.560 --> 00:46:37.920]   light form technology, groundbreaking technology. They mold to the contours of your ear to benefits
[00:46:37.920 --> 00:46:43.600]   that benefit number one. They fit like nothing else you've ever had before. They fit perfectly,
[00:46:43.600 --> 00:46:48.640]   which means a great seal, great base, great comfort. Benefit number two, no one can steal them
[00:46:48.640 --> 00:46:53.600]   because they're for you. Put them in, connect to the app, watch the purple LEDs form the earbuds
[00:46:53.600 --> 00:46:59.040]   to your unique shape. You get eight hours of continuous playback on a single charge, 20 hours
[00:46:59.040 --> 00:47:05.120]   with a charging case. I really love the soft riverstone contours of the charging case. It's
[00:47:05.120 --> 00:47:10.720]   really comfortable, really beautiful. And the sound, of course, it's built on industry leading
[00:47:10.720 --> 00:47:17.200]   expertise. Ultimate ears has been trusted by pro musicians and high-fi enthusiasts for over 25
[00:47:17.200 --> 00:47:24.320]   years. You want a description of it. It's a full, very warm sound. It's got a great punchy,
[00:47:24.320 --> 00:47:30.480]   tight low end. The high end is crisp. Of course, you have complete control of it with custom EQ
[00:47:30.480 --> 00:47:36.480]   presets in the app. You could play and pause music. You can answer calls. Yes, it's got a microphone
[00:47:36.480 --> 00:47:41.520]   built into it. And volume adjustment, all that can be set to custom actions in the app.
[00:47:42.400 --> 00:47:48.320]   And even if you try these and you don't love them as much as I do, don't worry because Ultimate
[00:47:48.320 --> 00:47:53.440]   Ears offers a 30-day money back guarantee even though these are molded to your ears. Free shipping,
[00:47:53.440 --> 00:47:59.840]   free returns, a one-year warranty. If you're looking for earbuds that are comfortable that you can wear
[00:47:59.840 --> 00:48:07.680]   all day that work beautifully, you want to try these. Go to ue.com/fits. And I want you to use
[00:48:07.680 --> 00:48:15.600]   the promo code MAC break just to let them know you saw it here. Uefits. Ue.com/fits to get your
[00:48:15.600 --> 00:48:23.760]   pair. Promo code is MAC break. These are my go-tos now. This is all I have in my pocket all the time
[00:48:23.760 --> 00:48:34.400]   because I love these so much. Ue.com/fits. Fits. Okay, you've already talked me off the ledge with the
[00:48:34.400 --> 00:48:41.200]   WWDC. I think Paul Hudson will have some love letter. It's a love letter. Thank you. It's the
[00:48:41.200 --> 00:48:45.120]   friends we make along the way. Thank you for reminding me. Yes. That's what really counts.
[00:48:45.120 --> 00:48:56.320]   Michael Sigh, who is a longtime Apple developer, put together a link role of tweets about Swift UI
[00:48:57.120 --> 00:49:05.200]   in 2022. And when you read this, it's pretty... It starts good even if you already know a bit or
[00:49:05.200 --> 00:49:12.880]   a lot. Stanford's course is incredible. I agree. And then it's half the iOS devs on my list keep
[00:49:12.880 --> 00:49:17.280]   posting stuff like, "Here's how I shipped an amazing full-featured cross-platform Swift UI app in 10
[00:49:17.280 --> 00:49:21.840]   minutes." And the other half are like button presses have been broken and Swift UI for 16 months and
[00:49:21.840 --> 00:49:28.800]   Apple hasn't responded to my radar. If you go through this, it is... Steve Troughton Smith, Swift UI
[00:49:28.800 --> 00:49:34.880]   remains incompetent at basic layout. Something playground users are going to find out the hard way.
[00:49:34.880 --> 00:49:39.200]   He had a really good point too where he said that the fact that Apple couples Swift UI with
[00:49:39.200 --> 00:49:44.240]   software releases rather than having it be its own independent developer thing is really problematic
[00:49:44.240 --> 00:49:49.040]   because something can change in Swift UI in the new version of macOS or iOS that he has to then
[00:49:49.040 --> 00:49:53.760]   fix. And sometimes a fix is not easy. And what do you do with your app that's out there broken
[00:49:53.760 --> 00:50:00.080]   in the meantime? But if it was more like... It was its own upgrade, then at least he could say,
[00:50:00.080 --> 00:50:03.360]   "This is supported up to this version of Swift UI and this is supported up to that version of
[00:50:03.360 --> 00:50:07.760]   Swift UI." So this obviously look a lot of... Group had a good line too where he said like,
[00:50:07.760 --> 00:50:12.160]   "For 80% of the stuff you want to do, it's the best thing ever." And then for the last 20%,
[00:50:12.160 --> 00:50:16.160]   you just want to throw yourself across the room. Yeah, Marco Armin. I like a lot of it, but it's
[00:50:16.160 --> 00:50:22.000]   not simple, easy, or mature. It's conceptual elegance and clean presentation slide code are
[00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:28.080]   quickly ruined by common real-world needs and you frequently slam hard into walls that you just
[00:50:28.080 --> 00:50:36.880]   can't overcome. It's a whole list. And it's super interesting because like Swift UI, it was sort of
[00:50:36.880 --> 00:50:41.120]   homegrown. I won't get into too many details, but there was someone working on the watch
[00:50:41.120 --> 00:50:45.440]   OS team and they were working on things like all of the complications and they started building
[00:50:45.440 --> 00:50:49.440]   this out as like a watch framework in order for to make it easier to make all of the stuff that
[00:50:49.440 --> 00:50:53.520]   you wanted to make for the watch. Things that were highly visual but very lightweight and had very
[00:50:53.520 --> 00:50:58.160]   specific requirements on low-powered... All of these different concerns. And Craig saw it and said,
[00:50:58.160 --> 00:51:04.560]   "Well, why don't we just do this everywhere?" And this very specific piece of watch gear or kit
[00:51:04.560 --> 00:51:10.720]   was then turned into Swift UI. And the people behind it are brilliant, but I think like Apple got
[00:51:10.720 --> 00:51:15.680]   really excited about it. And then 2020 and 2021 happened and their ability to move it forward got
[00:51:15.680 --> 00:51:21.360]   highly limited. And now they just have to really dig in and live up to the dream, to the promise
[00:51:21.360 --> 00:51:26.480]   that they made developers two years ago. Swift UI was to replace UI kit. You can still use UI kit,
[00:51:26.480 --> 00:51:30.880]   right? I mean, is... An information interface builder maybe more than just UI kit.
[00:51:30.880 --> 00:51:35.600]   Like it's a way of like... It's a declarative language. Like the whole point of Swift UI,
[00:51:35.600 --> 00:51:39.280]   and I won't get too far to the weeds with it, is that instead of you having to draw a yellow
[00:51:39.280 --> 00:51:43.040]   button, you can just say, "This is a yellow button." And the OS will interpret that across
[00:51:43.040 --> 00:51:46.560]   platforms. Like, "This is the appropriate yellow button on Mac OS, but this is the appropriate
[00:51:46.560 --> 00:51:50.880]   yellow button on Watch OS." And you won't have to code that over and over again. You're just declaring
[00:51:50.880 --> 00:51:56.640]   what it is and then it's interpreting the states to go with the general guidelines of that environment.
[00:51:56.640 --> 00:52:00.480]   And that can save a ton of time. But when you start to get into all the things that developers
[00:52:00.480 --> 00:52:04.480]   really want to do, you start running into those walls. Steve Troughton-Smith again.
[00:52:05.120 --> 00:52:11.280]   The harsh reality of Swift UI in 2022 is it does not enable a competent dev to build a better app.
[00:52:11.280 --> 00:52:17.760]   It gives you a lesser than native, less reliable, less compatible, less debuggable app, a two-tier
[00:52:17.760 --> 00:52:22.640]   system where third parties may never be able to compete with Apple's own. Short of a major
[00:52:22.640 --> 00:52:28.480]   advancement at WWDC 22 with regard to reliability, configurability, and backwards compatibility,
[00:52:28.480 --> 00:52:34.080]   I'm not sure Swift UI will ever be the right technology for my app. So Steve, and many, many
[00:52:34.080 --> 00:52:38.400]   more will be watching with interest on Monday. I think ever is a big word.
[00:52:38.400 --> 00:52:45.600]   If you're on the ground developing with Swift UI, you can understand why they might be.
[00:52:45.600 --> 00:52:49.840]   Oh, I understand what people are upset and I think that they have a lot of work to do.
[00:52:49.840 --> 00:52:55.920]   Building frameworks is complicated. It's why people don't build plugins or APIs because they
[00:52:55.920 --> 00:53:00.800]   don't want to deal with anybody else trying to use it. So it takes a while to
[00:53:00.800 --> 00:53:06.800]   together those. Anytime someone says, "One might kid say, 'Never, never.' I immediately give them a
[00:53:06.800 --> 00:53:10.160]   whole bunch of exceptions." I wish you never again. I wish you never again.
[00:53:10.160 --> 00:53:13.920]   This happens. Yeah, like it's just like, "Ever and never, I don't think this will ever work."
[00:53:13.920 --> 00:53:19.760]   I mean, those are big words. You know, that a couple of years you might decide that that
[00:53:19.760 --> 00:53:25.120]   might be worth it. But this is what Apple's pushing is his primary way to develop apps for
[00:53:25.120 --> 00:53:29.520]   back and forth. I think almost everybody knows that you can't do everything in Swift
[00:53:29.520 --> 00:53:35.280]   UI right now. I mean, I think that's a common knowledge that you can in Swift UI. It's great.
[00:53:35.280 --> 00:53:39.440]   You use the other things when you can't. I don't even know if Apple's selling that.
[00:53:39.440 --> 00:53:42.640]   I think they have enough trouble getting Apple engineers too.
[00:53:42.640 --> 00:53:48.560]   But that's not the nature of a lot of these complaints. A lot of these complaints is that
[00:53:48.560 --> 00:53:52.800]   this was working and then there was an update and now it's not working again. Or here is something
[00:53:52.800 --> 00:53:58.320]   that the documentation says, "Shootwork just fine as demonstrated, but then I do it." And
[00:53:58.320 --> 00:54:03.120]   not only is this not working, but it's not responding to any attempts it diagnosed the problem.
[00:54:03.120 --> 00:54:08.720]   So that's got to be absolutely doubly frustrating. But that's when you start to feel as though the
[00:54:08.720 --> 00:54:13.520]   company that created this system for you is actually working against your interests and not just
[00:54:13.520 --> 00:54:18.720]   is simply indifferent to your needs. Just all I got to say is, you want to go back to React Native
[00:54:18.720 --> 00:54:22.800]   and see how it works. Because I work on development teams and we work with React Native. And it's
[00:54:22.800 --> 00:54:27.520]   like, it's literally like there is a button here when you pull it, the whole building will fall down.
[00:54:28.480 --> 00:54:34.640]   So it's all about the platforms have their own issue. That's all it's.
[00:54:34.640 --> 00:54:39.280]   It needs to be updated. I'm just saying that when we say that it's different than any other
[00:54:39.280 --> 00:54:43.200]   development platform, I don't know what development platforms we're working with that have a ton of
[00:54:43.200 --> 00:54:53.280]   libraries. Well, I take your point definitely. Again, mankind is born and it's just born into
[00:54:53.280 --> 00:54:58.000]   hardship just as surely as the sparks as these sparks fly upward says Linus in one of those peanut
[00:54:58.000 --> 00:55:02.640]   strips when he's quoting the Bible that I don't know about. But yeah, the problem is there seem
[00:55:02.640 --> 00:55:06.960]   to be other ways around it when you're using other languages and other systems in order to create
[00:55:06.960 --> 00:55:12.720]   max software. The problem is that Swift gives you simplicity. But as is often the case, the trade
[00:55:12.720 --> 00:55:17.840]   off and simplicity is the lack of control. So that is something stops working. You just don't have
[00:55:17.840 --> 00:55:22.240]   your you don't have your not empowered to find a way to solve the problem. You have to wait for
[00:55:22.240 --> 00:55:27.040]   Apple to solve the problem for you and then hope that in the intervening time, they don't change
[00:55:27.040 --> 00:55:32.160]   the methodology so that the stuff that was broken will be wished into the cornfield to begin with.
[00:55:32.160 --> 00:55:38.720]   Anyways, this brilliant if there was this brilliant exchange yesterday on Twitter with Ken
[00:55:38.720 --> 00:55:43.200]   Kishinda who was the original he worked a lot of stuff at Apple. He worked one of the first people
[00:55:43.200 --> 00:55:47.680]   to work on Safari. He did the iPhone keyboard for years. He worked on the watch and he said that
[00:55:47.680 --> 00:55:53.600]   there's seven attributes for good software. It's simple, consistent, composable, scalable, obvious,
[00:55:53.600 --> 00:55:57.600]   communicative and accommodating. And then Dr. Wave jumped on immediately saying,
[00:55:57.600 --> 00:56:01.280]   yeah, but you got to put those in a priority order because every one of them is a compromise on the
[00:56:01.280 --> 00:56:07.280]   other. I would love to see, I mean, as long as you're an ask for USDZ and keynote, I'm going to ask
[00:56:07.280 --> 00:56:14.240]   for better support for progressive web apps in Safari. Apple has, I think, dropped the ball on that
[00:56:14.240 --> 00:56:19.120]   one. But it's it's it's nice to see that. Getting better and they have this little thing that shows
[00:56:19.120 --> 00:56:23.120]   how much they're compatible now. I forget that it's a cross browser standard that they worked on
[00:56:23.120 --> 00:56:26.800]   with Google and Firefox and a bunch of others. It shows how many features you fully support,
[00:56:26.800 --> 00:56:31.040]   how many support in experimental mode, how many are in development mode, and it's a really good
[00:56:31.040 --> 00:56:35.360]   way to see. Of course, the Safari's got a really good score because they support a ton of features
[00:56:35.360 --> 00:56:40.080]   that aren't related to progressive web apps. But it's just overall like they seem to be much more
[00:56:40.080 --> 00:56:45.920]   engaged with compatibility than before. Good. All right. Well, I'd love to see that. I'd love to
[00:56:45.920 --> 00:56:51.440]   see him say something about PWA on Monday. I'll put that on Monday. Well, you know, like their
[00:56:51.440 --> 00:56:56.800]   issue with it is that like they have a native operating system. Yeah, Google for large doesn't
[00:56:56.800 --> 00:57:00.640]   and Microsoft abandoned theirs. So for Apple, it's like just make a native app and everyone else is
[00:57:00.640 --> 00:57:05.840]   like, we don't do that anymore. Users would love it if we could. Well, I mean, the reason I say
[00:57:05.840 --> 00:57:11.360]   it is because it'd be great if I could make a PWA for a Twit that would work on all platforms.
[00:57:11.360 --> 00:57:16.080]   But we can't. Well, we can make it on every platform, but Apple, I guess that's just what we'll do.
[00:57:16.080 --> 00:57:20.640]   We can make an electron app, right? Do we just? Yeah, you could do an electron app. That's kind of
[00:57:20.640 --> 00:57:27.120]   not. That's what the mass market idea of progressive web app is these days. Oh, I know.
[00:57:27.120 --> 00:57:33.760]   It's such a pig. But electron apps are just, oh, there's a whole lot of viruses.
[00:57:33.760 --> 00:57:36.720]   Yeah, it's like multiple versions of Chrome. Yeah. Yeah.
[00:57:36.720 --> 00:57:44.320]   Sidia has prevailed against Apple, at least in the early part of the battle.
[00:57:44.320 --> 00:57:50.880]   Sidia, which is a third party app store, which you know, you can't really use on iOS unless you
[00:57:50.880 --> 00:58:00.480]   jailbreak your iOS. Jay Freeman, Sarik sued and Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers last Thursday
[00:58:00.480 --> 00:58:06.960]   said he could present his claim against the company. Apple asked that the bid that the
[00:58:06.960 --> 00:58:13.440]   complaint be dismissed. First, sued Apple at the end of 2020, saying the company had an illegal
[00:58:13.440 --> 00:58:20.080]   monopoly over iOS app distribution. Judge Rogers at that point dismissed Sidia's initial complaint,
[00:58:20.080 --> 00:58:25.760]   saying the suit fell outside the statute of limitations. But she allowed him to amend his case,
[00:58:25.760 --> 00:58:32.800]   which he did. The latest complaint, Sidia argues iOS updates Apple released between 2018 and 2021
[00:58:32.800 --> 00:58:40.640]   constitute overacts that harm distributors like the Sidia store. Judge Gonzalez Rogers found that
[00:58:40.640 --> 00:58:46.320]   sufficient to say, okay, you can move ahead. There not a lot of judges. Like Apple seems to get
[00:58:46.320 --> 00:58:49.840]   the same judges over. She's brilliant. I love I love her. She is absolutely brilliant. But I
[00:58:49.840 --> 00:58:53.280]   always hear the same judges and all the Apple case. I think it's because of the just the
[00:58:53.280 --> 00:58:58.560]   jurisdiction, you know, after the same. Yeah. But yeah, that is significant. The reason why she
[00:58:58.560 --> 00:59:02.880]   threw out the original case was that one of the things they were asserting is that every single
[00:59:02.880 --> 00:59:08.400]   time a develop a new developer signs up with Apple, every single time they publish an app
[00:59:08.400 --> 00:59:14.320]   constitutes a new infraction. And so therefore would reset the full year. Yeah, yeah, yeah,
[00:59:14.320 --> 00:59:19.440]   the four year clock for filing a lawsuit. And that's why she threw it out in early January.
[00:59:19.440 --> 00:59:24.000]   But again, said that by that that's the only reason why we're not lying this go forward. But if you
[00:59:24.000 --> 00:59:30.480]   if you want to try it again by all means go through. So now their argument is that they that Apple
[00:59:30.480 --> 00:59:38.880]   made specific changes to how iOS handles apps in 2018 and 2019. This is unrelated to the security
[00:59:38.880 --> 00:59:43.360]   flaws they keep patching to make sure that you can't side load apps without permission. They said
[00:59:43.360 --> 00:59:48.080]   that they're making the case that no, they they fundamentally changed how iOS handles apps so that
[00:59:48.080 --> 00:59:54.000]   even if city could install an app, it would not be executed for any number of reasons for this
[00:59:54.000 --> 00:59:59.200]   technology that was introduced in 2018, 2019, the judge ruled that yes, this is a brand this this
[00:59:59.200 --> 01:00:04.480]   this does constitute a brand new infraction. And therefore that does fall within the four year
[01:00:04.480 --> 01:00:09.600]   for your purview Apple basically raised the same objection that did last time. And the judge said,
[01:00:09.600 --> 01:00:13.600]   Nope, guess what? Let's we'll see it. We'll see you next week. Because we're this case is on.
[01:00:15.200 --> 01:00:18.640]   So this is one more place where Apple is facing a
[01:00:18.640 --> 01:00:22.160]   court. Over there's over there. Yeah, I know it doesn't.
[01:00:22.160 --> 01:00:29.680]   I mean, the EU the EU is much more of a clear and present. You know, I think that I think that
[01:00:29.680 --> 01:00:34.960]   the time is passing on on the US legislation. So I think that the EU is really where the battle
[01:00:34.960 --> 01:00:42.960]   front probably is. The fight to unionize Apple retail continues.
[01:00:44.320 --> 01:00:49.600]   Apple stores in New York, Maryland, and Atlanta all announced their intention
[01:00:49.600 --> 01:00:56.480]   to unionize along with Louisville, Kentucky. I think Atlanta stores saying that there was too
[01:00:56.480 --> 01:01:03.440]   much intimidation has put off their votes. Actually, they would the National Label Relations Board,
[01:01:03.440 --> 01:01:08.400]   which is where they have to notify the intention to have this this election. They basically notify
[01:01:08.400 --> 01:01:14.480]   them three or four days ago that they were withdrawing their their their notification. And just today,
[01:01:14.480 --> 01:01:19.520]   as a matter of fact, the NLRB, uh, acknowledged and processed it. So now that's off. Although the
[01:01:19.520 --> 01:01:23.360]   although the weird thing is that the reason why I know that was processed today was because I was
[01:01:23.360 --> 01:01:29.120]   looking to see if the union and the any of these employees had filed a new grievance against Apple
[01:01:29.120 --> 01:01:34.560]   with the NLRB related to what they claim to be as harassment and intimidation and violation
[01:01:34.560 --> 01:01:41.520]   of United States labor laws. No such I couldn't find any such filing yet. So okay, they're they're
[01:01:41.520 --> 01:01:46.160]   saying that they had 70% support amongst the workers who were going to be eligible to vote.
[01:01:46.160 --> 01:01:51.120]   But the intimidation that Apple had had been applying against them was just too great to overcome,
[01:01:51.120 --> 01:01:56.720]   which sounds suspicious. I would like to I think we're all waiting to see like actual examples of
[01:01:56.720 --> 01:02:03.280]   what do you think they actually did to intimidate people so bad that you would not put on an election
[01:02:03.280 --> 01:02:08.880]   where you felt as though 70% of the voters would vote to unionize your shop. That's kind of interesting
[01:02:08.880 --> 01:02:16.960]   don't you think? Uh, Apple's HR head D. Drew O'Brien gave a recorded speech to Apple stores. You know,
[01:02:16.960 --> 01:02:21.360]   they also heard their retail head retail head as well. Now right. That's right. Yeah. Well,
[01:02:21.360 --> 01:02:24.160]   she's not anymore. I think that I think the HR has moved to somebody else. But I hope
[01:02:24.160 --> 01:02:30.160]   okay. Okay. People had she took over when Angela Aaron's left. Um, she, uh, are you not getting my
[01:02:30.160 --> 01:02:38.880]   audio? John or. Collective. This is vice. Uh, over the last few years, we have been through
[01:02:38.880 --> 01:02:45.360]   so much together and we've worked hard to always pull together. This is again, uh, what a lot of
[01:02:45.360 --> 01:02:50.960]   companies do. Amazon's done it. They they go out. They hire litigators as Apple did. They've hired
[01:02:50.960 --> 01:02:57.280]   the same litigators. Apple Amazon did to kind of union bust to discourage employees from voting
[01:02:57.280 --> 01:03:03.280]   for a union. And then they have required meetings where employees have to sit down and listen to
[01:03:03.280 --> 01:03:09.840]   executives, explain to them why a union would be such a bad idea. Our guiding principles throughout
[01:03:09.840 --> 01:03:17.040]   is to do our best to do what's right and to always support each other. And like, unless you want a
[01:03:17.040 --> 01:03:23.040]   union. Okay. Sorry. Yeah. To learn and to grow. And together, we've made so many changes and
[01:03:23.040 --> 01:03:29.200]   adjustments to the way we support our customers and the way we support you from raising pay to
[01:03:29.200 --> 01:03:34.480]   giving special bonuses from additional vacation and sick leave days. It's fair for them to make
[01:03:34.480 --> 01:03:38.080]   their case. I don't think there's anything wrong with that, but, but there, you know, you mother
[01:03:38.080 --> 01:03:44.480]   and I give and we give and we give this is the next week. Yeah. She says, well, I'll play some
[01:03:44.480 --> 01:03:51.920]   word. You can enjoy it to paid family care and emergency backup care for all team members full
[01:03:51.920 --> 01:04:01.600]   time and take care. I am deeply committed to making Apple the best you can be for you. Everything
[01:04:01.600 --> 01:04:06.400]   from scheduling to paying benefits. You know, that's compelling. If you feel like we have room to
[01:04:06.400 --> 01:04:12.000]   improve and there are some areas where we need to move even faster. And I'm always so
[01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:17.760]   happy that you share that you share that with us so that we can build our plans together.
[01:04:19.200 --> 01:04:23.760]   Very soon we'll be sharing the results of our most recent pulse survey. I'm just saying that
[01:04:23.760 --> 01:04:30.960]   feedback is a gift. It truly is forward to continuing to build on our very special culture.
[01:04:30.960 --> 01:04:34.720]   She says, I'm worried about what it would mean to put another organization in the middle of our
[01:04:34.720 --> 01:04:39.440]   relationship and organization that does not have a deep understanding of Apple or our business
[01:04:39.440 --> 01:04:45.600]   and does not share our commitment to you. As you pointed out, Andy, I think on Sunday,
[01:04:45.600 --> 01:04:52.160]   Apple just gave its retail workers a boost saying the starting wage would now be $22 an hour instead
[01:04:52.160 --> 01:04:58.000]   of $20 an hour. But I think it was you who pointed that out on Sunday that that might be in response
[01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:02.640]   to the organization. I mean, which shows that they could have done it anytime.
[01:05:02.640 --> 01:05:10.880]   And it's you're free to think whatever you want. I'm not saying that my opinion on this is
[01:05:10.880 --> 01:05:18.320]   absolutely the right one. I'm just saying that it's this paternalistic attitude towards employees
[01:05:18.320 --> 01:05:23.360]   where, gosh, don't we take such good care of you? And you're really part of our family. And then
[01:05:23.360 --> 01:05:27.680]   when you ask mom and dad for, hey, how about a raise my allowance? Then suddenly you're not
[01:05:27.680 --> 01:05:33.360]   a member of the family anymore. You're just some sort of peon. And the reason there's been a
[01:05:33.360 --> 01:05:40.560]   history of complaints about employees about their positions at Apple retail and really,
[01:05:40.560 --> 01:05:44.720]   they're not addressed until it becomes a PR problem, in which case, they suddenly,
[01:05:44.720 --> 01:05:49.440]   Apple suddenly decides that, okay, well, maybe a formal complaints are made. And maybe at that
[01:05:49.440 --> 01:05:53.840]   point, they decide that, okay, maybe we won't force you to punch out at five o'clock, but then
[01:05:53.840 --> 01:05:59.680]   stay in the store until five 25 25 30 waiting for security to check your bags to make sure
[01:05:59.680 --> 01:06:04.560]   you're not stealing anything from us. And it's it's not it's really is the difference between
[01:06:05.440 --> 01:06:11.200]   a large company that just simply wants to be able to do what it wants, what it feels is right,
[01:06:11.200 --> 01:06:17.280]   what it thinks it's how they think they can make its workers happy or at least stop complaining
[01:06:17.280 --> 01:06:23.520]   versus employees who have the right to strike, who have the right to to collective bargaining,
[01:06:23.520 --> 01:06:27.520]   and that if they do decide that, well, look, we've been we've been complaining consistently
[01:06:27.520 --> 01:06:31.520]   about this issue for three or four or five six months, you have not done anything. You've not
[01:06:31.520 --> 01:06:36.880]   even acknowledged anything. We have basically filed the paperwork for a strike. And we're all walking
[01:06:36.880 --> 01:06:43.840]   out at at 10 a.m. on Monday. And suddenly, if you're then suddenly if you're unionized, you don't
[01:06:43.840 --> 01:06:47.840]   you have a whole bunch of rights protected by the federal government, that Apple's gonna have to
[01:06:47.840 --> 01:06:51.520]   consume can kind of have to consider and gonna have to deal with. Whereas if you're not a member
[01:06:51.520 --> 01:06:54.960]   of the union, well, God, guess what, we've fired you for cause because you didn't show up to work on
[01:06:54.960 --> 01:07:01.440]   that day. So this is this I do believe that I don't believe that Apple is is an evil company. I don't
[01:07:01.440 --> 01:07:05.600]   think they're mean. I don't think they're screwed. I don't think they're abusive employers. But I
[01:07:05.600 --> 01:07:09.920]   do think that a lot of people get annoyed when I remind them that Apple is a two trillion dollar
[01:07:09.920 --> 01:07:16.160]   company. But again, when you have a huge company, that's a lopsided balance of power. And a unionized
[01:07:16.160 --> 01:07:21.600]   workforce can help give those employees some of the power to negotiate and to complain and to make
[01:07:21.600 --> 01:07:27.040]   sure that they're treated seriously. And not just as a PR problem. I don't think we'll be seeing a TV
[01:07:27.040 --> 01:07:35.120]   plus show about this the way we do it. No, I don't think normal normal normal Ray, the TV series is
[01:07:35.120 --> 01:07:40.880]   not coming to Apple TV. But I also think like, I understand that even like big companies can be
[01:07:40.880 --> 01:07:44.800]   like afraid of the unknown, like, you know, some of all their fears and they have something going
[01:07:44.800 --> 01:07:48.880]   and they have control over it and these things are changes and changes are scary. And it's hard
[01:07:48.880 --> 01:07:52.800]   to believe like a three trillion dollar company is scared by things like this. But they are. And I
[01:07:52.800 --> 01:07:56.400]   think it would just be such a better world because Apple is in such a position and they've taken
[01:07:56.400 --> 01:08:00.880]   such a role of leadership in so many civil and societal areas that if they look at this as an
[01:08:00.880 --> 01:08:04.960]   opportunity, like regardless of how it all says out storebys, I don't know how it works in American
[01:08:04.960 --> 01:08:08.880]   labor laws are so confusing to me to be honest with you. I don't know how it works, but even if
[01:08:08.880 --> 01:08:13.120]   it's store by store, just look at the potential, the opportunities and the benefits that could
[01:08:13.120 --> 01:08:16.960]   accrue. This whole tech thing with where they hire out all these like the contract that all
[01:08:16.960 --> 01:08:22.400]   these jobs, it is so distasteful when it comes from companies that are this big and keeps saying
[01:08:22.400 --> 01:08:26.240]   they have such a commitment to their workforces and to all of these things. And they could be making
[01:08:26.240 --> 01:08:29.840]   such like, like, I know it's great that they involved themselves in societal issues. I think
[01:08:29.840 --> 01:08:33.680]   that's fantastic. But they could be so doing so much to lead by example on just how they run
[01:08:33.680 --> 01:08:39.520]   their companies and I hope they think about that more deeply. Micah decided that he wanted to bypass
[01:08:39.520 --> 01:08:47.760]   the apples, the darn Apple store. And he ordered the big boxes. The very, the iPhone, he's gonna
[01:08:47.760 --> 01:08:53.600]   fix his own. He could fit in one of those. Seventy, what is it? 76 pounds in two different
[01:08:53.600 --> 01:09:00.880]   pelican cases. But that's just the tools. What we found out was Apple ships the tools
[01:09:00.880 --> 01:09:07.680]   separately from the parts. Yeah. So the tools came and sat for a week. You only get seven days
[01:09:07.680 --> 01:09:12.560]   before you have to return them or they'll charge you. So they sat for a week while we waited for
[01:09:12.560 --> 01:09:19.120]   the battery. The battery never came. We called and said, Hey, can we have an extension? And they
[01:09:19.120 --> 01:09:25.360]   said, Nope. Seven days is up. Send it in or you're going to be paying 1100 bucks for these fine
[01:09:25.360 --> 01:09:31.200]   tools. Since we decided we didn't want to keep the tools. We they are pretty nice. I mean, look,
[01:09:31.200 --> 01:09:36.880]   this is Apple's response. This is the Apple's response to the, you know, right to repair is
[01:09:36.880 --> 01:09:42.880]   okay. We'll we'll have the parts. We'll let we'll rent you the tools. You can see, obviously,
[01:09:42.880 --> 01:09:47.520]   you don't want to buy these. They're very fancy, very elaborate, very expensive. I mean, you can
[01:09:47.520 --> 01:09:50.960]   get the fix it once if you don't want these. Like they'll just give you the battery too if you want.
[01:09:50.960 --> 01:09:55.520]   Right. But does it? Is that as good as an Apple repair? Do you? I mean,
[01:09:55.520 --> 01:10:00.560]   Lewis Rossman had a brilliant video. Like the Verge wrote an article on this. And I did not
[01:10:00.560 --> 01:10:04.000]   expect the video that Lewis Rossman gave me about this issue. I thought he'd be going, yeah,
[01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:08.400]   he's like, this is why is the Verge making me defend Apple? And he's like, you shouldn't be
[01:10:08.400 --> 01:10:12.000]   complaining that they give you tools. You should be complaining about the 900 things are still not
[01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:18.080]   doing for right to repair. At least this is a very limited set of phones. You can't do any
[01:10:18.080 --> 01:10:22.800]   older phones. The phones are really doing it. Like if you are a Michael, Micah is way more
[01:10:22.800 --> 01:10:27.680]   intelligent. I could never I could never even get this. But he's also incredibly precise. And maybe
[01:10:27.680 --> 01:10:31.120]   Micah would be okay doing it with like the splooges that you and like the microwaves that you get
[01:10:31.120 --> 01:10:34.800]   from my fix it. A lot of people are. But there are some people who are going to be like,
[01:10:34.800 --> 01:10:40.240]   I need the screen to be perfect. Incidentally, exactly. Shortly after we returned.
[01:10:40.240 --> 01:10:50.640]   The kit, the battery did come. And so now Micah, two hours, did he end up
[01:10:50.640 --> 01:10:56.400]   he only had two hours. So there go the we wanted we didn't want to pay for the tools.
[01:10:57.440 --> 01:11:01.920]   I'm thinking which should have paid. So this is important to understand if you're thinking about
[01:11:01.920 --> 01:11:08.240]   doing this. By the way, after all said and done, you're not saving any money. The cost ends up being
[01:11:08.240 --> 01:11:12.160]   very close to what it would cost to have an Apple store do it. And Apple is losing a ton of money
[01:11:12.160 --> 01:11:17.680]   shipping all those tools all around for 49 bucks. I mean, the whole thing is whack. But it is. But
[01:11:17.680 --> 01:11:23.440]   it is a really, really big deal that there are people in this country that don't have an Apple
[01:11:23.440 --> 01:11:27.520]   store within that even an hour's drive away. But you can mail it to Apple. You don't have to have
[01:11:27.520 --> 01:11:30.320]   a store. You can mail it to Apple. It's hard to do it without your phone for that long.
[01:11:30.320 --> 01:11:37.440]   Yeah. Right. Exactly. So it's not nothing. But I think that this is the way that they decided to
[01:11:37.440 --> 01:11:44.480]   interpret user user done repair. Just simply say, we can't create the infrastructure to validate
[01:11:44.480 --> 01:11:49.440]   procedures and tools for I fix it. But we can ship but we can ship out our own tools and write up
[01:11:49.440 --> 01:11:55.120]   instructions. Even running up instructions does not not cheat. That costs a lot of money to create
[01:11:55.120 --> 01:12:01.280]   that documentation. But you'd think that I'm pretty sure I'm if I have to guess, I'm guessing that
[01:12:01.280 --> 01:12:06.880]   they they shipped the tools via via air. But it was a lithium battery. So they had a ship that
[01:12:06.880 --> 01:12:11.680]   via ground and that's wet lag behind. But that's something that they should have been able to
[01:12:11.680 --> 01:12:16.000]   anticipate. And they should have basically said they should have shipped them both ground or they
[01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:21.520]   should simply should have said the clock starts as the seven day clock starts running as soon as
[01:12:21.520 --> 01:12:28.240]   your order is complete. It remains to be seen whether is Apple committed to self repair, in which
[01:12:28.240 --> 01:12:33.760]   case they'll fix that problem. Or is this just Apple's malicious compliance saying, sure, you can
[01:12:33.760 --> 01:12:38.960]   fix it. Have fun. And I think it's I think it's a couple either way though. Like you could
[01:12:38.960 --> 01:12:42.720]   didn't make these available. People would be going, Apple, it's not even giving us the same tools
[01:12:42.720 --> 01:12:46.800]   that they gave us. Like they should have both options. Like you should be able to choose the tools or
[01:12:46.800 --> 01:12:50.720]   something easier. It would be a buy. You can buy those tools too. Right. It's not. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
[01:12:50.720 --> 01:12:55.200]   You don't have to run them. You could buy them. So a small repair shop. The problem is you only can
[01:12:55.200 --> 01:13:02.320]   repair the brand new iPhone SE, the 12 and the 13. So the phones that do need batteries, which are
[01:13:02.320 --> 01:13:07.520]   iPhone 678. You can't repair yourself. So you're going to have to give those to Apple anyway.
[01:13:07.520 --> 01:13:13.440]   So I really feel like it was just the 12 and 13. Yeah. This is very much the new SE, not even
[01:13:13.440 --> 01:13:18.400]   because I had the SE two and they couldn't get a repair kit for that. So
[01:13:18.400 --> 01:13:23.600]   interesting. I feel like this is Apple's lip service. I think we'll know from more when the M1
[01:13:23.600 --> 01:13:27.200]   Mac because they're supposed to roll out M1 Mac repair. That'll be interesting. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
[01:13:27.200 --> 01:13:32.480]   Yeah. I think I'll really judge them a year from now because this really does seem like something
[01:13:32.480 --> 01:13:38.720]   that they rolled out on a shorter timetable than perhaps they would have liked. They have the
[01:13:38.720 --> 01:13:43.840]   examples of Samsung and Google to go by working with I fix it, but Samsung and Google, they will
[01:13:43.840 --> 01:13:50.080]   they work with I fix it directly. They provide them with actual legitimate parts. They verify that
[01:13:50.080 --> 01:13:54.000]   the tools and the techniques that they have are absolutely correct. And they are basically
[01:13:54.000 --> 01:14:00.000]   being I fix is being conscripted into like the local repair depot for both of these products.
[01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:05.520]   So they've set a standard that I think Apple reasonably needs to match right now because that's
[01:14:05.520 --> 01:14:12.480]   not doing it, especially when I framework, the framework laptop is absolutely blowing everybody
[01:14:12.480 --> 01:14:19.520]   away by the not only they're not only they building a laptop that can be easily repaired
[01:14:19.520 --> 01:14:25.360]   on a very low level by anybody with just one or two simple tools. Not only can you buy replacement
[01:14:25.360 --> 01:14:30.640]   parts, not only can you upgrade this laptop by buying the 2022 version of the logic board and
[01:14:30.640 --> 01:14:37.360]   swapping out your 2020 2021 logic board. They recently responded to complaints from like the big
[01:14:37.360 --> 01:14:41.840]   like again, Lewis Rosman style repair people saying, well, this useless without schematics,
[01:14:41.840 --> 01:14:46.240]   it, oh, okay, we'll give you schematics. Like, okay, you no longer you no longer have the
[01:14:46.240 --> 01:14:51.280]   oscilloscope and trace signals from one place to another. If you want to know like what where
[01:14:51.280 --> 01:14:55.680]   this capacitor is connected to and why power is not getting to that, just download the schematic
[01:14:55.680 --> 01:15:00.800]   and we'll show you not again, I appreciate that few companies can do this, but they are answering
[01:15:00.800 --> 01:15:06.000]   the question of they're they're basically causing a lot of itchy underwear for companies are saying,
[01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:12.240]   but it would be absolutely impossible to do it's not technically possible to build a computer this
[01:15:12.240 --> 01:15:20.640]   way or run a company this way. And to their credit, they had some they had some claims about the floppy
[01:15:21.280 --> 01:15:26.000]   lids. So I have a framework, I love it, I built I assembled it myself. And now I'm thinking, yeah,
[01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:30.720]   maybe I'll I mean, I just I got it relatively recently, but maybe I will upgrade to the 12th gen
[01:15:30.720 --> 01:15:35.360]   and get the new lid at the same time. And you can do the whole thing. And it's not hard. You can do
[01:15:35.360 --> 01:15:40.400]   it yourself. I put it, I got the DIY version of the framework. It's a wonderful the only negative on
[01:15:40.400 --> 01:15:47.440]   the laptop is a great laptop is battery life is not superb. I'm so spoiled by the Apple and like,
[01:15:47.440 --> 01:15:52.000]   this is like a choice that they make a deliberate choice that they make is they don't use commodity
[01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:55.920]   parts like a lot of times, even in phones and computers, like Dell famously, you could pick the
[01:15:55.920 --> 01:16:00.800]   sisterboard daughterboard you wanted to stuff together. They get almost every part that they
[01:16:00.800 --> 01:16:04.720]   make is a custom part like even if it looks like it's off the rack, they often go in and say,
[01:16:04.720 --> 01:16:08.240]   no, the energy efficiency is not high enough. This is not high enough. It's not to our spec.
[01:16:08.240 --> 01:16:12.240]   And they get them to change it and they make a unique part for themselves. And then they don't
[01:16:12.240 --> 01:16:15.440]   and they put a lot of time and effort and resources behind that. And then they just don't they don't
[01:16:15.440 --> 01:16:18.640]   want that part to be commonly available to anybody else. They're like, well, we don't want to make a
[01:16:18.640 --> 01:16:24.000]   better like Apple. Like the DDR Ram that Apple puts in their laptops or an iPhone, it's not off
[01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:27.600]   the shelf. It's a special variant made for Apple that's even more power efficient than the standard
[01:16:27.600 --> 01:16:30.960]   low power versions. And they don't want to share that with the companies because then they feel
[01:16:30.960 --> 01:16:34.720]   like those companies get it for free. So they have incredibly restrictive contracts for these.
[01:16:34.720 --> 01:16:37.680]   They say, we're going to show you how to make this. And then you can only sell it to us,
[01:16:37.680 --> 01:16:42.560]   which complicates repairability, it complicates supply. Like they just don't have a lot of those
[01:16:42.560 --> 01:16:46.240]   because they're not the off the shelf version that they make. And so in many ways, they're creating
[01:16:46.240 --> 01:16:50.480]   a better product that's also creating enormous problems for everything but that product.
[01:16:50.480 --> 01:16:56.240]   I love it. I've framework does an I fix it style guide on how to replace it. They have,
[01:16:56.240 --> 01:17:00.160]   you know, the steps required. They have videos. This is this is how a company,
[01:17:00.160 --> 01:17:07.200]   you know, essentially this is what laptop should be. If they had, if Apple did this,
[01:17:08.640 --> 01:17:14.960]   why wouldn't they do this? This is not, by the way, a clunky or rattly or loose laptop. This is a
[01:17:14.960 --> 01:17:21.200]   very, very nice laptop in every respect. And to be fair, there's a difference between Apple scale
[01:17:21.200 --> 01:17:26.560]   and the startup. I guess so. Yeah, that's true. And let's also keep our fingers crossed that
[01:17:26.560 --> 01:17:30.640]   framework is still around in five years. Well, that was the gamble, right? And that's why I'm so
[01:17:30.640 --> 01:17:35.040]   encouraged by the fact that they're selling now 12th gen into motherboard replacements because
[01:17:35.040 --> 01:17:39.200]   that shows that they, yeah, this was the plan where I could, I could upgrade the motherboard,
[01:17:39.200 --> 01:17:45.440]   is new parts, processors came out. We haven't been able to do that in years. That's really
[01:17:45.440 --> 01:17:49.280]   the thing is like the some of the trade offs are real. Like when you, when you solder the
[01:17:49.280 --> 01:17:52.880]   ram, like one of the biggest complaints in every laptop is that the ram gets unset. And people
[01:17:52.880 --> 01:17:56.480]   don't know that's the problem, but the laptop stops working. And if you open it up and you go in
[01:17:56.480 --> 01:18:00.240]   and you reset the ram, you know, it starts working again. But just by soldering the ram in, they
[01:18:00.240 --> 01:18:04.640]   reduce their their support calls by I think was greater than 50%. And that's a terrible
[01:18:04.640 --> 01:18:08.960]   solution for people who like to go in and reset their ram. But there's not a lot of people like
[01:18:08.960 --> 01:18:13.280]   in the greater mainstream market who actually want to go in and reset their ram. So these
[01:18:13.280 --> 01:18:17.600]   constant trade offs that keep getting made. Yeah. Yeah, that's a good point. It's just it's just
[01:18:17.600 --> 01:18:25.680]   absolutely stinks when it's when you're you're just out of Apple, Apple care laptop died and
[01:18:25.680 --> 01:18:30.160]   dammit, well, it's too it's too pretty to throw away. I'm just going to put on your shelf.
[01:18:30.160 --> 01:18:34.640]   And then like you see a video that's every time. Yeah, exactly. And then you find out that
[01:18:34.640 --> 01:18:39.840]   the warranty. No, it's it's I mean, it is a real problem. And then you find out that no, it's not
[01:18:39.840 --> 01:18:45.840]   that it it's not it's it's not like the the it's not like it absolutely just fell apart like the
[01:18:45.840 --> 01:18:50.560]   blues mobile at the end of the movie. It was no see this one little power chips that's connected
[01:18:50.560 --> 01:18:56.000]   to the charger that overheated and that has a tendency to overheat. It's a basically a dollar
[01:18:56.000 --> 01:19:00.880]   87 part. If you could actually source it from somewhere, there's probably somewhere someone
[01:19:00.880 --> 01:19:07.040]   within a 30 mile radius of you that could get your back back up and running for $75 for parts and
[01:19:07.040 --> 01:19:12.480]   one minimum one hour of labor. But you can't get that one chip. And otherwise, it's a perfectly
[01:19:12.480 --> 01:19:18.160]   when Apple would Apple has done such wonderful stuff about about green computing in the environment.
[01:19:18.160 --> 01:19:23.280]   It stinks when you have a beautiful display, beautiful keyboard, beautiful CPU, beautiful
[01:19:23.280 --> 01:19:27.520]   everything in the logic board, except for that one chip. And that's why all of this, including
[01:19:27.520 --> 01:19:33.120]   lithium batteries are becoming turning into e-waste. Let me take a little break more to come. Andy
[01:19:33.120 --> 01:19:38.560]   and I cover an a Richie Alex Lindsay, you're watching Mac break weekly, listening to Mac break weekly.
[01:19:38.560 --> 01:19:44.800]   Our show today brought to you by collide. We're we're we use Slack for our internal messaging. And
[01:19:44.800 --> 01:19:50.800]   I know a lot of companies do. And if you are using Slack and you want to be secure, you got to find
[01:19:50.800 --> 01:19:56.560]   out about collide. It's a new take on endpoint management that I really, really like. You know,
[01:19:56.560 --> 01:20:03.600]   traditional endpoint management with MDM and, you know, locking down everything. Kind of the
[01:20:03.600 --> 01:20:09.200]   implication is your users are idiots can't be trusted. And we're going to make sure we put superglue
[01:20:09.200 --> 01:20:16.080]   in all the USB ports so they can't get our company taken down by ransomware. And I understand that
[01:20:16.080 --> 01:20:24.560]   point of view. I really do. But there is a better way. Get the users involved in security so that
[01:20:24.560 --> 01:20:30.880]   they buy in, they understand, and then they become instead of your enemies, your allies
[01:20:30.880 --> 01:20:38.160]   in all of this. This is collide's idea in contrast to old school device management tools like MDM,
[01:20:38.160 --> 01:20:43.120]   which lock down your employees devices without considering their needs or even attempting to
[01:20:43.120 --> 01:20:48.240]   educate them about the security of the laptop collide is built by security practitioners like you
[01:20:48.240 --> 01:20:55.120]   who saw just the just exactly the problem with doing this, which is, and users get frustrated.
[01:20:55.120 --> 01:21:00.800]   They throw up their hands. They end up switching to their own devices. Don't tell anybody. And that's
[01:21:00.800 --> 01:21:06.720]   bad for everybody all around. So there is this wonderful middle ground with collide. Instead of
[01:21:06.720 --> 01:21:11.440]   locking down a device, collide takes a user focused approach. It communicates security
[01:21:11.440 --> 01:21:19.840]   recommendations directly to your employees on Slack. In fact, they're there there from the very
[01:21:19.840 --> 01:21:25.920]   beginning. The very first message from collide is here, let's install the endpoint agent on your
[01:21:25.920 --> 01:21:31.520]   system and why you want to do it. And here you are, you're going to do it yourself. It turns security
[01:21:31.520 --> 01:21:38.320]   from some kind of sort of black and white police state into a dynamic conversation. And after
[01:21:38.320 --> 01:21:43.280]   after the endpoint agent is installed, collide regularly sends employees recommendations
[01:21:43.280 --> 01:21:47.840]   when their device is in an insecure state. You can see if you go to the website, you can see
[01:21:47.840 --> 01:21:51.920]   how great these are. You know, hey, your screen lock isn't set up correctly. You may, you don't
[01:21:51.920 --> 01:21:57.360]   want somebody to send an email from your machine while you're at lunch. So let's, let's get that
[01:21:57.360 --> 01:22:02.800]   password in there or things like asking people to secure two factor backup codes that are sitting
[01:22:02.800 --> 01:22:08.080]   in the clear and the download folder. Because you're talking directly to employees with
[01:22:08.080 --> 01:22:14.880]   respect, you're educating about the company's policies, how to keep their devices secure.
[01:22:14.880 --> 01:22:20.640]   You're using real world examples, not theoretical scenarios. You're making them allies. You're making
[01:22:20.640 --> 01:22:28.400]   them allies in the quest to keep your company safe. K-O-L-I-D-E collide cross platform, endpoint
[01:22:28.400 --> 01:22:35.280]   management, wherever Slack lives, Linux, Mac or Windows puts end users first, get endpoint
[01:22:35.280 --> 01:22:42.720]   management that puts the user first, K-O-L-I-D-E collide.com/macbreak to learn more to try it free for 14
[01:22:42.720 --> 01:22:50.640]   days. You don't even need a credit card, collide.com/macbreak. And by the way, there's your goody bag,
[01:22:50.640 --> 01:22:57.360]   stickers and t-shirt, all sorts of cool swag after signing up for a new trial as their way of saying,
[01:22:58.000 --> 01:23:06.080]   thank you. I've got a collide sticker on my laptop. Collide. K-O-L-I-D-E.com/macbreak. Thank you,
[01:23:06.080 --> 01:23:13.600]   collide for respecting end users and for still helping the security folks keep things safe.
[01:23:13.600 --> 01:23:20.880]   I don't, you know, in a way, I hope they don't ship a new M2 MacBook here because then I would
[01:23:20.880 --> 01:23:25.520]   feel like I need it by it. I don't think I do need to buy it. You don't have to buy every, well,
[01:23:25.520 --> 01:23:29.760]   it depends, like, reviewer Leo might want to buy things to review them, but consumer Leo doesn't
[01:23:29.760 --> 01:23:33.200]   need to buy every one. No, I have the, I'm very happy with the 14-inch MacBook Pro
[01:23:33.200 --> 01:23:40.480]   and one pro in it. I can't remember what I put in it, but it's very, it's, it's, it's,
[01:23:40.480 --> 01:23:46.480]   it's just as fast, frankly, as anything else. Well, now Renee, I know they're not going to,
[01:23:46.480 --> 01:23:52.640]   but if they were to announce an M2, even if they asked it, they probably wouldn't ship it till
[01:23:52.640 --> 01:23:56.800]   September, but even if they, but if they did, well, how much faster would an M2 be?
[01:23:56.800 --> 01:24:01.360]   So this, this is where it's getting complicated because previously it looked like they were
[01:24:01.360 --> 01:24:04.560]   going to follow a very simple, like the, the same scheme they've been following for a long time,
[01:24:04.560 --> 01:24:09.040]   and that was M2 was going to be based on the A50 and the way M1 was based on A14, and it was
[01:24:09.040 --> 01:24:13.280]   going to just linearly move through that. But now, like, according to Guomingchi and
[01:24:13.280 --> 01:24:19.680]   I think maybe Mark Rimmett, but a couple other leakers, it sounds like they're having a really
[01:24:19.680 --> 01:24:24.640]   hard time getting what they need out of Taiwan's semiconductor. And so it's possible that this
[01:24:24.640 --> 01:24:30.080]   will be an M1 plus, which means that it'll still be like, it'll be like an A15 hybrid where it has,
[01:24:30.080 --> 01:24:34.560]   it's like M1, but it has the A15 cores. So instead of having Firestorm and Icestorm,
[01:24:34.560 --> 01:24:40.080]   it'll have Blizzard and Avalanche. And so you'll get like, you know, between a five and 20% uptick
[01:24:40.080 --> 01:24:45.360]   in single core operations and an massive uptick in GPU, or much more massive, like 30% uptick in
[01:24:45.360 --> 01:24:50.080]   GPU up lift in GPU operations. But it's totally unclear what they're actually going to deliver,
[01:24:50.080 --> 01:24:55.840]   and we'll be called M1 plus, will it actually be M2, will M2 now wait and be based on an A16 or
[01:24:55.840 --> 01:25:00.160]   an A17? I think it's really, really hard to tell right now, just because we have very little
[01:25:00.160 --> 01:25:04.000]   visibility into into what's happening on the supply chain. I feel like Apple's going to have
[01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:12.080]   a hard time because with M1, they had such a leap in performance and battery life, you know,
[01:25:12.080 --> 01:25:17.120]   TPU that they're not going to be able to do that every generation. And so there's going to be
[01:25:17.120 --> 01:25:23.440]   a bit of from now on. Yeah. And so I think there's some expectation management that's going to have
[01:25:23.440 --> 01:25:29.680]   to happen. And I suspect that might be something that happens on Monday. Even now, when you look at
[01:25:29.680 --> 01:25:33.760]   like the M1 range, like there's two, there's basically time and space is how you increase the
[01:25:33.760 --> 01:25:39.360]   power of a chip. So time is like, you just, you can increase the core so that's more work done at
[01:25:39.360 --> 01:25:43.920]   the same time. So basically if you're, if you have a cargo ship that's going from London to New York,
[01:25:43.920 --> 01:25:48.560]   you can just put more and more cargo things on it. So the ship takes the same amount of time,
[01:25:48.560 --> 01:25:53.040]   but the amount of work you can get done gets exponentially bigger, like one cargo on a cargo
[01:25:53.040 --> 01:25:57.600]   ship two, four, eight, you know, 16, you're getting much more done, but it's still, it's that amount
[01:25:57.600 --> 01:26:02.480]   of time to get it done. And then you can get a faster ship. But those ships only get incrementally
[01:26:02.480 --> 01:26:07.120]   faster. And then you start putting more, so my guess is, my estimate for this is it'll be a
[01:26:07.120 --> 01:26:12.240]   little bit faster per core. And then it'll have all the same like, you know, pro max ultra versions
[01:26:12.240 --> 01:26:16.640]   with many massive cores. But it's only ever going to process shrinks. So like the years that we get
[01:26:16.640 --> 01:26:20.160]   process shrinks, those are going to be great. Like when it goes down to three nanometer, when it goes
[01:26:20.160 --> 01:26:24.480]   down to two nanometer, after that there'll be more significant gains. But I also think the time of
[01:26:24.480 --> 01:26:28.560]   big cores are over like Intel hit that wall really, really hard. There was only so many cores they
[01:26:28.560 --> 01:26:34.160]   could stuff into anything. And now basically Intel and Nvidia are literally fighting over the last few
[01:26:34.160 --> 01:26:39.280]   watts that are left in a normal house plug. Like they both want to be over 600 watts. And you literally,
[01:26:39.280 --> 01:26:43.520]   you'd have to put like two different circuits on them at that point, which is ridiculous.
[01:26:43.520 --> 01:26:47.360]   So like just adding cores is in the solution. So I think what Apple's doing, which is off core
[01:26:47.360 --> 01:26:53.680]   features, things like ProRes engines, neural processing engines, all of those things are going
[01:26:53.680 --> 01:26:59.040]   to become increasingly important, not just bigger and more cores, but dedicated silicon to do things
[01:26:59.040 --> 01:27:03.520]   that are very appealing to people like creative pros and other. That's going to be the thing to
[01:27:03.520 --> 01:27:07.360]   watch. What Apple does, given that they can't really do these big jumps in processor,
[01:27:07.360 --> 01:27:16.960]   colors, also, loom large. That's when you know you're kind of hit the edge of what you can do. So
[01:27:16.960 --> 01:27:21.040]   they're going to, but we can do it in color now. Well, that's an advantage. Like I think a lot of
[01:27:21.040 --> 01:27:24.400]   people thought that M1 was just going to help with battery life. Like it's so much more efficient,
[01:27:24.400 --> 01:27:28.000]   we can just get more battery life, which is true. But because it's so much more efficient,
[01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:31.760]   there's a lot, a lot less heat in it. And that means like you could literally not put an
[01:27:31.760 --> 01:27:37.760]   older lake in the M1 Mac iMac. It would melt. It would burn down and melt. It just needs a bigger
[01:27:37.760 --> 01:27:42.000]   thermal envelope. And the same is going to be true with the new Mac Pro. So it lets you make
[01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:46.080]   designs that you could never make before, or it lets you run them in ways like without a fan or a
[01:27:46.080 --> 01:27:53.120]   very low fan, or put them inside a Mac studio that just literally would not fit those big hot
[01:27:53.120 --> 01:27:57.200]   hungry cool ones. Is that on your bingo card, Alex? Do you want to know more about the Mac Pro
[01:27:57.200 --> 01:28:01.520]   on Monday? I figure you probably do. No. I mean, well, sure. I mean, I just don't think it'll
[01:28:01.520 --> 01:28:05.920]   ship anytime soon. So I think we'll play a time. Yeah, it'd be great. I mean, I don't think if
[01:28:05.920 --> 01:28:10.320]   we saw it before November, like we could actually buy one, I think I would be pretty surprised. But
[01:28:10.320 --> 01:28:15.280]   if they want to show us a Mac, I'm always open. I think it would hurt for the Mac Pro to come out
[01:28:15.280 --> 01:28:20.800]   so early because I have the Mac studio, which I purposely only got the Macs, not the Ultra,
[01:28:20.800 --> 01:28:25.840]   because I was like, well, I haven't until the fall to save up from it. So I'm very happy with
[01:28:25.840 --> 01:28:30.240]   the Macs. I don't think there's much my Ultra is great. The only the biggest, again, I've said
[01:28:30.240 --> 01:28:36.080]   this before, my biggest regret with the with the my Ultra on the Macs. My my studio is great. My
[01:28:36.080 --> 01:28:41.120]   only request is I didn't my only regret is I didn't max it out to 8 terabytes because the drive is
[01:28:41.120 --> 01:28:49.200]   unbelievably fast. It's so fast. Yeah. Five things. Yeah. In the stateful, older RAM. Yeah.
[01:28:49.200 --> 01:28:56.400]   Yeah. I renew my my fantasy of I wonder what Apple could do with a Mac and an Apple TV form
[01:28:56.400 --> 01:29:03.120]   factor with this new silicon. I realize that the Apple TV is essentially is essentially running
[01:29:03.120 --> 01:29:12.240]   like the M zero or the M minus one or probably the M minus two chip equivalent. But as Renee said,
[01:29:12.240 --> 01:29:16.080]   when you don't have to worry about power, you don't have to worry about cooling, you don't have to
[01:29:16.080 --> 01:29:24.000]   worry about ramp and runaway power consumption. There's something there's something so sexy to me
[01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:30.080]   about having a Mac nano, you know, having having something that tiny that could even just be easily
[01:29:30.080 --> 01:29:34.720]   like visa mounted to the back of any display you want. So that's something to come something to
[01:29:34.720 --> 01:29:42.080]   compete with $500 like or even $400 super budget PCs, but much much better because this will be a
[01:29:42.080 --> 01:29:47.680]   Mac and this won't have the sort of crap bloatware and insecurity that that super super cheap PC
[01:29:47.680 --> 01:29:55.200]   will have or basically just making Macs available to a wider range of people. And most of my complaints
[01:29:55.200 --> 01:30:02.960]   about the price ranges of Apple computers has been dissipated by how good the iPad is, how flexible
[01:30:02.960 --> 01:30:08.160]   it is and how cheap they are down to $330 for an excellent example. But there's still that little
[01:30:08.160 --> 01:30:15.200]   fantasy of I just want a kid to get a stocking stuff or $299 Mac, even if they even if they said
[01:30:15.200 --> 01:30:19.360]   there's there there are there are ways that we made we wanted to make this extra extra simple
[01:30:19.360 --> 01:30:24.640]   and extra extra approachable. So this one can't sideload apps at all. It has to get all of its apps
[01:30:24.640 --> 01:30:28.720]   through the app store, but all of our best and safest apps are through the app store.
[01:30:28.720 --> 01:30:36.640]   It is true that the Apple TV prices have dropped again. I wonder if we'd see an M1 based Apple
[01:30:36.640 --> 01:30:43.360]   4k Ultra Apple TV. That'd be kind of cool. They didn't need like though they're very specific
[01:30:43.360 --> 01:31:07.060]   and in right sizing their their chipsets. It's an 8-
[01:31:07.060 --> 01:31:12.260]   really slow wired ethernet. Why does it have so little system RAM? How much top why does it have
[01:31:12.260 --> 01:31:19.460]   so little storage and they could it annoys me because I'm I live in a world in which I think that
[01:31:19.460 --> 01:31:24.100]   well I really want this machine even if it's a streaming box to have a lot of headroom so that
[01:31:24.100 --> 01:31:30.420]   I can do things I haven't imagined today. But Apple credibly can say what would what from the app store
[01:31:30.420 --> 01:31:35.620]   in apps that run on Apple TV would require more RAM than what we're giving you and why what will
[01:31:35.620 --> 01:31:40.660]   you'll be streaming that would require you know like 10 gigabit ethernet or even gigabit ethernet.
[01:31:40.660 --> 01:31:46.340]   The reality is the online your online connection to for most people's internet connection is not
[01:31:46.340 --> 01:31:51.540]   as fast as the connection that is in the Apple TV and I think that the Apple TV is already
[01:31:51.540 --> 01:31:57.540]   painfully overpowered compared to every other thing that's a device that provides you know other
[01:31:57.540 --> 01:32:03.620]   than a computer everything else that ties into your your any OTT box is about a quarter of the
[01:32:03.620 --> 01:32:11.380]   power that the Apple TV is and so I mean it's what except for next block Xbox and PlayStation maybe
[01:32:11.380 --> 01:32:15.300]   but but as far as the I mean the other ones are you know little sticks and everything else they're
[01:32:15.300 --> 01:32:20.820]   I mean the processing power inside of a the total capability of an Apple TV is dramatically higher
[01:32:20.820 --> 01:32:25.620]   um you know and so it's so I think that they have to charge more and the question is like who would
[01:32:25.620 --> 01:32:29.620]   buy it you know like like you know and now people like me if you've made it I'd rather pay three
[01:32:29.620 --> 01:32:34.420]   hundred dollars and have it be all souped up and and have it but but most people are you know gonna
[01:32:34.420 --> 01:32:38.740]   want to spend as little as possible. I'm sorry for interrupting you like I just got excited just
[01:32:38.740 --> 01:32:43.940]   got excited because one of my favorite things is still my complaints about the Apple TV mostly
[01:32:43.940 --> 01:32:49.940]   stem from how good my Nvidia Shieldbox is which costs roughly the same amount of money as a good
[01:32:49.940 --> 01:32:58.180]   app as the best Apple TV but it really is like a fully capable like TV countertop computer it can
[01:32:58.180 --> 01:33:03.220]   actually it doesn't just run Plex it can actually run as a Plex server like I can actually attach
[01:33:03.220 --> 01:33:09.860]   an external hard drive to it have it record TV shows off of a off of a streaming box uh acts
[01:33:09.860 --> 01:33:16.100]   as a DVR stream that anywhere I am in the world uh it has it can run a regular web browser it can
[01:33:16.100 --> 01:33:23.060]   the the newer ones can even like automatically scale intelligently scale up 1080 to 4k and do it
[01:33:23.060 --> 01:33:28.740]   in a very very convinced not like oh good okay technically it works but I feel like I want to
[01:33:28.740 --> 01:33:33.620]   hurt my eyeballs because for forcing me to actually watch this I don't want to watch this again it's
[01:33:33.620 --> 01:33:40.420]   like a magical thing and so I just wish that you have you everyone who says that of the streaming
[01:33:40.420 --> 01:33:45.860]   box is for most people I say nearly all people is it just a very utilitarian thing there's a reason
[01:33:45.860 --> 01:33:52.580]   why the Apple TV is just a black rounded rounded square with absolutely no features surface features
[01:33:52.580 --> 01:33:57.540]   or attractive things to whatever you plug it in you forget it exists and it just does the job
[01:33:57.540 --> 01:34:02.900]   it just acts as an invisible interface to all your streaming services but it's I really wish that
[01:34:02.900 --> 01:34:07.380]   it could do see what Apple could do with a hundred fifty dollar streaming box if they were if they
[01:34:07.380 --> 01:34:17.700]   decided that the Nvidia Shield for instance were their competition uh the good news is FoxCon says
[01:34:17.700 --> 01:34:22.900]   hey there's no shortage there's no chip shortage although I have a feeling a long
[01:34:22.900 --> 01:34:27.700]   edge is taking long long the overall this is we're say we're savoring the
[01:34:27.700 --> 01:34:32.500]   manufactured process we're enjoying it so much today FoxCon raised its outlook for the current
[01:34:32.500 --> 01:34:40.180]   quarter in full year inciting improved supply chain stability in China who knew a young Lou the
[01:34:40.180 --> 01:34:45.380]   chairman said the overall lockdown impact he's talking about the lockdown in Shanghai on FoxCon
[01:34:45.380 --> 01:34:51.380]   is rather limited you can tell from our revenues in April and May's performance is also better
[01:34:51.380 --> 01:34:58.100]   than we estimated so there so what are we waiting for other companies or affected more they got
[01:34:58.100 --> 01:35:02.740]   some of those contracts moved to them so they're probably super happy yeah I ordered I made a big
[01:35:02.740 --> 01:35:09.300]   mistake by the way just a little word of warning I'm from now on only ordering max from the Apple
[01:35:09.300 --> 01:35:18.340]   store I ordered you just got around to that I got somebody was offering a company called Simply
[01:35:18.340 --> 01:35:25.540]   Mac they're uh I mean they're not I've heard of them they're their official apple reseller but
[01:35:25.540 --> 01:35:30.740]   they were offering I think 300 bucks off of Mac studio so I went and ordered that was back in April
[01:35:33.140 --> 01:35:40.660]   yeah they took my four thousand dollars immediately oh wow yeah so now here I am 10 weeks later
[01:35:40.660 --> 01:35:48.420]   and I know worded all from them nothing so now just they are an apple premium partner but I guess
[01:35:48.420 --> 01:35:53.460]   I could do a charge back I don't know I think it was probably a little over a decade ago right now
[01:35:53.460 --> 01:35:57.300]   I'm just two years ago I was just like I am not I'm just gonna go to the apple store and buy apple
[01:35:57.300 --> 01:36:01.780]   products it's it's just I know we can talk about we can do it in a lot of other places and maybe
[01:36:01.780 --> 01:36:06.740]   save a hundred dollars here there was a false economy the pain the you know getting your apple
[01:36:06.740 --> 01:36:11.140]   and you just wait until you want to do your apple care thing or whatever like all of those
[01:36:11.140 --> 01:36:17.380]   things are just so difficult once you get outside the ecosystem that I just I'll cancel it I was
[01:36:17.380 --> 01:36:25.060]   for it was for Henry because I wanted his tiktoks to to sing but now I mean I feel terrible I told
[01:36:25.060 --> 01:36:32.020]   him 10 weeks ago yeah I'm getting you the ultra but I know I'm making my contribution to his
[01:36:32.020 --> 01:36:37.140]   his his worth there thank you I got a lot of salt did you buy some salt oh good thank you
[01:36:37.140 --> 01:36:42.980]   yeah yeah I got the the the truffle salt is really it's really expensive but worth every penny
[01:36:42.980 --> 01:36:48.580]   well he's he has reformulated it he's got oh my gosh we need we need some new ones because the
[01:36:48.580 --> 01:36:53.460]   the problem that we had is is that we lost the salt it got misplaced oh no there was some drama
[01:36:53.460 --> 01:37:00.500]   in the house about where the hell has the salt a god it's the truffle the truffle salt
[01:37:00.500 --> 01:37:04.020]   there was there was well he's never going to stop the truffle garlic because that is the best
[01:37:04.020 --> 01:37:08.020]   seller but you look how expensive it is compared to the others but here's the deal you're just
[01:37:08.020 --> 01:37:12.660]   pretty little that's true it's a little it's a little it's a little bit of love across things
[01:37:12.660 --> 01:37:17.540]   get a new chimichurri flavor that's quite good oh I use chimichurri for breakfast
[01:37:17.540 --> 01:37:24.020]   yeah yeah I use some of that on my burger on on my birthday good that was just that little that
[01:37:24.020 --> 01:37:28.580]   little that you're right it's just that little stuff that you can't you can't figure out what you
[01:37:28.580 --> 01:37:34.900]   did to make this thing so slam on and it was just like oh I just I just used the right amount of a
[01:37:34.900 --> 01:37:41.380]   really good salt yeah yeah yeah it's that Robert Downey Jr. sprinkling and jiffle flavor answers
[01:37:43.380 --> 01:37:51.060]   anyway I'm sorry Hank I don't know why I'm buying him max he should be buying me max now but uh yeah
[01:37:51.060 --> 01:37:56.260]   well you know because they that's an investment is an if that's the thing that happens when you make
[01:37:56.260 --> 01:38:00.740]   their billions he used to tell me when he was a kid he says be nice to me I'm don't forget I'm
[01:38:00.740 --> 01:38:07.300]   choosing your nursing home and I'll put you in the crooked one like 60 minutes exactly exactly

[01:38:14.740 --> 01:38:21.300]   I want it I guess I guess I'm just gonna go get a charge back that's such a so sad yeah a lot
[01:38:21.300 --> 01:38:27.780]   of waste of time yeah I think it's I think the FTC says you only have 30 days to you know you
[01:38:27.780 --> 01:38:34.980]   can't take the money and then disappear for 10 weeks yeah anyway that's a public service in
[01:38:34.980 --> 01:38:39.700]   Darumple getting super angry on Twitter today no what's he pissed off about now is his wedding day
[01:38:39.700 --> 01:38:45.460]   they're oh well he wasn't angry about that he was super happy about it yeah he's super
[01:38:45.460 --> 01:38:50.180]   ever upset because apple started like much like they insert ads into the news plus service when
[01:38:50.180 --> 01:38:56.900]   you pay for it they're inserting ads into the music apple music app uh for other apple music
[01:38:56.900 --> 01:39:01.860]   things and it's sort of I've never seen my dms drenched because he's like I don't write anymore
[01:39:01.860 --> 01:39:06.980]   but Gruber Snell Richie please somebody write this up I'm gonna take over your websites and everyone's
[01:39:06.980 --> 01:39:12.020]   like why you shouldn't have retired but uh it led to this cavalcade of of people being super unhappy
[01:39:12.020 --> 01:39:17.460]   that apple is inserting upsells into every part of iOS on on on your wedding day it's like
[01:39:17.460 --> 01:39:20.500]   it's like an upsell on your wedding day
[01:39:20.500 --> 01:39:24.740]   Gruber says you should have never retired
[01:39:27.380 --> 01:39:32.180]   I uh my baby is gonna play this in apple news when I say I want to mute somebody I would love to have
[01:39:32.180 --> 01:39:37.300]   it not be a big black space that says you muted the space but you could watch it if you wanted to
[01:39:37.300 --> 01:39:44.260]   I'm like I muted it I don't want to ever know that it existed and um somehow I this isn't actually
[01:39:44.260 --> 01:39:50.580]   I'm with Jim he's listening to the apples classic rock station and an ad for strombo appears
[01:39:51.300 --> 01:40:00.020]   in the middle of it no no I don't want that I don't blame Jim for being upset uh Snell responds
[01:40:00.020 --> 01:40:04.020]   they're inserting interviews anymore they're interviewing this thing insert yeah right he
[01:40:04.020 --> 01:40:09.700]   he's not a Canadian anymore right he's he's our he we bought him and we traded him for Wayne
[01:40:09.700 --> 01:40:15.380]   Gretzky or something um they're they're inserting interviews in their playlists too well no I don't
[01:40:15.380 --> 01:40:20.020]   want to hear an interview I want music yeah well that's gonna turn people off it was just a
[01:40:20.020 --> 01:40:23.620]   delightful story there was this delightful story about like and I don't know if this is true it's
[01:40:23.620 --> 01:40:29.140]   apocryphal that eddy q was always much more aggressive about business opportunities and upselling
[01:40:29.140 --> 01:40:34.580]   than Phil uh shiller was and so he'd wait for Phil to go on vacation and then send out a push
[01:40:34.580 --> 01:40:40.180]   notification for a new apple service and that sounds very much like uh you know like the odd
[01:40:40.180 --> 01:40:45.220]   couple sort of behavior but I think increasingly when apple sets things like we're gonna double
[01:40:45.220 --> 01:40:49.780]   services revenue over the next few years we're gonna take subscriptions to 600 million I think
[01:40:49.780 --> 01:40:54.340]   this is the stuff that this is the consequence of that and it adds a certain corrosiveness to the
[01:40:54.340 --> 01:41:01.540]   user experience yeah and it's it's especially stands out when it's an apple thing like I I think that
[01:41:01.540 --> 01:41:07.300]   apple news for me is a bargain because it lets me read articles that would cost me like a hundred
[01:41:07.300 --> 01:41:13.700]   dollars a month via paywall otherwise like Wall Street Journal and other things but man alive it is
[01:41:13.700 --> 01:41:20.180]   in the the difficulty in saying wow that's a really interesting story I'd like to talk about it next
[01:41:20.180 --> 01:41:26.580]   week on NPR I'll I'll take the URL and put it in the bookmark file where I put stories that I'm
[01:41:26.580 --> 01:41:33.780]   keeping an eye on it is not possible you can't get a URL to even if it's not a but not iOS which
[01:41:33.780 --> 01:41:38.340]   is right exactly like you can there's no way to pop up even if you just want to recommend this to
[01:41:38.340 --> 01:41:42.820]   somebody else it's like no no we want to steer you towards back to apple saying be up but I don't
[01:41:42.820 --> 01:41:47.460]   want to be steered to apple too bad it's like yeah the Mac version has opened and so sorry but
[01:41:47.460 --> 01:41:53.300]   the iOS version does not and it's just ah so it's so it's so obnoxious I would even tolerate
[01:41:53.300 --> 01:41:59.460]   oh it's it's they they don't they want to try to they're they're using dark UI to make sure that
[01:41:59.460 --> 01:42:03.300]   you do the thing that they want you to do but once you read this wonderful article and I'm
[01:42:03.300 --> 01:42:07.220]   more you'll figure out you'll find out how to do it and then you'll just or you'll script it and
[01:42:07.220 --> 01:42:14.100]   it'll just work fine like no damn it and apple you you do so many things very well it's like it's
[01:42:14.100 --> 01:42:18.740]   it's it really is like when the best gymnasts in the world like stubs their toe when they're
[01:42:18.740 --> 01:42:24.420]   walking out to the mat it's like it's nothing it's absolutely like it's total human behavior but it
[01:42:24.420 --> 01:42:29.140]   just sticks out so much more when you see somebody that's like walking along and jumping and twisting
[01:42:29.140 --> 01:42:35.380]   on a three inch beam like a gazelle it's like oh that really does stick out here on a brighter note
[01:42:35.380 --> 01:42:38.740]   is a picture of Jim Dalrymple on his wedding day
[01:42:38.740 --> 01:42:47.220]   beer in hand looking out at the ocean clearly who I think it's Hawaii honest man out of him
[01:42:47.220 --> 01:42:54.180]   it's there you go finally he looks he looks that looks like the photo you send your bank like six
[01:42:54.180 --> 01:42:59.140]   months after you retire and they find out how much you embezzled from them and never get their
[01:42:59.140 --> 01:43:02.980]   money back photo that that jerk sends to Canadians when they're middle of a blizzard he's just like
[01:43:02.980 --> 01:43:10.660]   oh god oh congratulations that is just that is just wonderful i'm so happy that he's happy
[01:43:10.660 --> 01:43:17.140]   yeah you know to me when a guy like Jim Jim Dalrymple is happy that is an indication that maybe the
[01:43:17.140 --> 01:43:20.660]   world it works the way it's supposed to be a well he's not he's a fly of another generation he's
[01:43:20.660 --> 01:43:24.580]   happy ish because let's not forget they're still putting ads in his apple music yeah true
[01:43:25.460 --> 01:43:32.900]   come out of retirement you made me pulled me back in uh apple has a patent i i i know i'm not
[01:43:32.900 --> 01:43:39.860]   going to give this a whole lot of credence but they have a patent for putting a camera in the crown
[01:43:39.860 --> 01:43:41.620]   of the apple watch
[01:43:41.620 --> 01:43:49.540]   uh patent for everything so i had watches with cameras in them it is not a good experience you
[01:43:49.540 --> 01:43:55.060]   would look like a if you if you turn it upside down you could look like you could look like that
[01:43:55.060 --> 01:43:58.660]   with that member spider man super creepy was a ski slope actually had a camera the guy was
[01:43:58.660 --> 01:44:03.220]   talking to the woman in the ski slope with a Samsung camera watch i just have to ask is there like a
[01:44:03.220 --> 01:44:08.020]   macro mode so that you can get like the full detail of my wrist hair yeah exactly that's all
[01:44:08.020 --> 01:44:13.380]   you're gonna get exactly you know the key the key is to go is to is to do it like uh spiderman so
[01:44:13.380 --> 01:44:20.900]   you just roll it under oh yeah oh yeah that's that's you gotta make that noise every every picture of
[01:44:20.900 --> 01:44:24.660]   everybody's going to be like because they're trying to figure out why the hell are you doing
[01:44:24.660 --> 01:44:29.940]   that what's that yeah exactly are you okay are you trying to do do do you need money for cav chair is
[01:44:29.940 --> 01:44:36.420]   that it yeah oh i think i think although it would be it is a patent so it could be so it could be
[01:44:36.420 --> 01:44:41.860]   anything but i i have i find it hard to believe that that would be useful in any way for picture
[01:44:41.860 --> 01:44:47.460]   taking unless as the patent says part of it was being able to pop the the pop the watch off to
[01:44:47.460 --> 01:44:51.620]   actually treat it like more of a normal camera but the first thing i thought about is using it using
[01:44:51.620 --> 01:44:56.740]   a camera as a as a sensor like for more data as opposed to something that would actually be used to
[01:44:56.740 --> 01:45:00.500]   take pictures with i you know a lot of times when we look at these patents we have to remember that
[01:45:00.500 --> 01:45:05.620]   like i you know some companies that i've worked for or consulted for they basically you get these
[01:45:05.620 --> 01:45:09.940]   instructions that say hey if you're out in the field you don't see anyone anyone around you like
[01:45:09.940 --> 01:45:13.620]   there's no one else doing what you're doing you should talk to the lawyers like like like like
[01:45:13.620 --> 01:45:17.140]   like start just just have meetings with them all the time and just explain what you're doing
[01:45:17.140 --> 01:45:20.500]   like and and they'll figure out whether there's something you have to say file yeah well and you
[01:45:20.500 --> 01:45:25.060]   and you get a bonus for it you know like so so the so the um and so so the thing is is that but
[01:45:25.060 --> 01:45:29.540]   you just start it's like if you're in a competitive market in competitive area don't worry about it
[01:45:29.540 --> 01:45:34.740]   but if you suddenly realize hey there's no one around like i'm all by myself just talk to the lawyers
[01:45:34.740 --> 01:45:38.820]   like like just already stuff down so it's that's that's that's the kind of like the kind of organic
[01:45:38.820 --> 01:45:43.620]   web shooters Alex and i had to make web shooters in a chemistry lab and minor digital which are
[01:45:43.620 --> 01:45:47.860]   good but they're not as good as the analog ones you know like they're they fall apart there's a
[01:45:47.860 --> 01:45:53.060]   little bit of quantization they come out i'll tell you i'll tell you what i do have what i have is a
[01:45:53.060 --> 01:45:59.700]   genetic proclivity i'm basically Darwinianly engineered for winter warfare in like eastern
[01:45:59.700 --> 01:46:07.620]   europe rest so that's yeah not not so not so good for like running fast you know through the
[01:46:07.620 --> 01:46:14.180]   Arizona deserts but if you want someone to like hunker down dig a dig a hole in snow hunker down
[01:46:14.180 --> 01:46:18.580]   and damn it you're not you're not going to get you're not going to get past me and and over and
[01:46:18.580 --> 01:46:25.140]   across the Volga Volga river this is the sort of genetic stock you want somebody i don't know if
[01:46:25.140 --> 01:46:33.140]   i would trust him named Shiba doge obviously a fan of crap coins uh asked Elon Musk when are
[01:46:33.140 --> 01:46:39.140]   you going to put apple uh carplay in your teslas it's one of the main reasons i didn't buy another
[01:46:39.140 --> 01:46:46.020]   teslas because teslas media system is not very good in my opinion i want a carplay which i love
[01:46:46.020 --> 01:46:54.740]   in my maki eelon responded we'll discuss this and other improvements with tesla audio engineering
[01:46:54.740 --> 01:46:58.420]   but then he said the model s and x sound systems incredible so i think that's
[01:46:58.980 --> 01:47:03.620]   eelon just saying eelon's basically external pr for like he got rid of the tesla pr department
[01:47:03.620 --> 01:47:06.340]   now he's doing it all himself on twitter which is something that you would never recommend an
[01:47:06.340 --> 01:47:10.980]   executive to this i i believe him as much as i believe an apple patent it's like okay
[01:47:10.980 --> 01:47:16.340]   he definitely thought he definitely typed that that that's the new story is that
[01:47:16.340 --> 01:47:21.380]   eelon must type the following sequence of characters and symbols and then hit the send button yeah
[01:47:21.380 --> 01:47:26.580]   but at this point come on his tweets are getting weirder and weirder and weirder i gotta say i just
[01:47:28.740 --> 01:47:32.340]   i don't even want to think about him to be honest with a richest man in the world and we think
[01:47:32.340 --> 01:47:38.020]   that he's kind of unhinged unhinged oh and and and he's he's starting he's basically starting his
[01:47:38.020 --> 01:47:43.380]   own band of pirates to sue anybody and everybody that he feels has affronted him and oh that's good
[01:47:43.380 --> 01:47:52.020]   free speech baby i feel great hey apple music does have something going for it bts has set a new apple
[01:47:52.020 --> 01:48:00.260]   music one record for the biggest show if you are not a teenage girl you may not know
[01:48:00.260 --> 01:48:07.620]   who bts is they're a very popular kpop band uh boy band they dance together very well
[01:48:07.620 --> 01:48:14.020]   in fact isn't there gonna be an apple fits bts channel i feel like i think i heard that
[01:48:14.820 --> 01:48:22.820]   um so on april i'm sorry on may 29th the apple music account announced the bts army broke the record
[01:48:22.820 --> 01:48:28.420]   for the biggest show of the year with their debut episode of bts radio i mean they know twitter
[01:48:28.420 --> 01:48:35.060]   me but they're not bad hey what i like to know don't mess with the bts army versus the kiss army
[01:48:35.060 --> 01:48:38.980]   that is something that's a pay per view that i would absolutely have four powerful powerful
[01:48:38.980 --> 01:48:50.260]   powerful powerful yeah they they they screwed with trump and so um if you steal if you steal um
[01:48:50.260 --> 01:48:59.060]   uh a bag a smartphone from a f1 driver prepared to be chased at high speeds
[01:49:00.340 --> 01:49:11.220]   a Sebastian Vettel one of the champion f1 drivers used app he used apples find my to attempt to
[01:49:11.220 --> 01:49:18.100]   track down thieves would stolen his bag by riding a scooter through the city his earbuds were in
[01:49:18.100 --> 01:49:24.660]   the bag the driver for Aston Martin did in fact find the earphones but not the bag i guess the
[01:49:24.660 --> 01:49:31.940]   thieves realized that the earpods were telegraphing their location never never ever ever do that
[01:49:31.940 --> 01:49:37.940]   like secondary crime scenes are seldom a win for anybody like if someone's got your stuff let
[01:49:37.940 --> 01:49:43.060]   of like go tell the police because if you track them down bad things could happen to you yeah and
[01:49:43.060 --> 01:49:49.140]   everybody's had a bag stolen in Barcelona it's just kind of part of the part of the fun of top us and

[01:50:13.060 --> 01:50:14.900]   um
[01:50:16.580 --> 01:50:25.220]   apple newton 30 years ago 30th anniversary here's the piece from arse technica yesterday remembering
[01:50:25.220 --> 01:50:31.620]   apple's newton 30 years on i guess this means i should run over to my cupboard and get it may 29th
[01:50:31.620 --> 01:50:38.900]   1992 apple and ask this is john scullies baby right this was not uh in fact scullies said what do
[01:50:38.900 --> 01:50:46.660]   you say about pdas like that he created the term pda so this is the future and public display is
[01:50:46.660 --> 01:50:54.260]   of inflection right that was yep yeah no it was it was amazing at the at the launch event uh for
[01:50:54.260 --> 01:51:00.580]   the newton they even had like engine they had a non-functional prototypes of other platforms that
[01:51:00.580 --> 01:51:06.980]   would be running newton no s including like a desk tablet including smaller phone form factors
[01:51:06.980 --> 01:51:12.740]   including stuff that would be integrated into like a desktop phone they really really were all in on
[01:51:12.740 --> 01:51:18.180]   this it was it was a nice it was a nice system it was just it was just it was probably the google
[01:51:18.180 --> 01:51:24.260]   glass of uh of apple in that it was really good it was it was brilliant it was there's nothing
[01:51:24.260 --> 01:51:29.700]   like it and was ahead of its time and as soon as another company did to them what apple usually does
[01:51:29.700 --> 01:51:35.780]   to other companies as soon as palm basically said that hey what if we take everything that
[01:51:35.780 --> 01:51:41.380]   people are complaining about the newton fix it get rid of everything that we don't actually need so
[01:51:41.380 --> 01:51:46.580]   we can sell it so people can afford it and actually include a full developer kit for free instead of
[01:51:46.580 --> 01:51:51.220]   charging a thousand dollars for it so we'll immediately get the biggest pile of apps for this thing
[01:51:51.220 --> 01:51:56.820]   possible yeah that's when people said yeah maybe i maybe i want something will that for three hundred
[01:51:56.820 --> 01:51:59.700]   or five hundred dollars that will stick in my pocket as opposed to something that's thousand
[01:51:59.700 --> 01:52:05.620]   dollars that i will need to build the leather hip nevertheless the newton did show uh the way
[01:52:05.620 --> 01:52:10.740]   forward for handheld devices absolutely before the palm with that would do handwriting recognition
[01:52:10.740 --> 01:52:17.540]   um and let's not forget that in order to power the newton apple funded with three million dollars
[01:52:17.540 --> 01:52:24.100]   a small british computer company called acorn which had a risk cpu a brand new cpu design
[01:52:24.100 --> 01:52:30.820]   that had very low power requirements and of course the acorn risk machine and the acorn chip
[01:52:30.820 --> 01:52:38.980]   became the foundation for arm acorn risk machine ar and so if it weren't for the newton i don't know
[01:52:38.980 --> 01:52:44.500]   if we'd have if we'd have the m1 i don't know yeah it really was wonderful they also they it also
[01:52:44.500 --> 01:52:49.300]   was the first apple failure for licensing because you could get front one from sony you can get
[01:52:49.300 --> 01:52:55.060]   uh a newton o s device from other manufacturers too i mean but there was a lot of really interesting
[01:52:55.060 --> 01:53:01.460]   posts steve jobs ideas wrapped up in this but again it's it's this is this is why this is the sort of
[01:53:01.460 --> 01:53:06.580]   thing that makes me wonder about augmented reality and virtual reality goggles from apple that
[01:53:06.580 --> 01:53:10.580]   again it's not enough that you have this brilliant thing that it demos really well that's definitely
[01:53:10.580 --> 01:53:14.900]   ahead of its time do people look at this look at the store look at the price tag i think this
[01:53:14.900 --> 01:53:20.900]   definitely solves a problem that i'm experiencing right now it wasn't cheap i the original message
[01:53:20.900 --> 01:53:25.860]   pad went on sale august second 1993 it was announced on this day in 1992 but didn't
[01:53:25.860 --> 01:53:31.780]   there there's talk about early announcement i took a year before it actually uh actually that
[01:53:31.780 --> 01:53:40.660]   can't be right is that right it was may 29th 1992 apple announced the newton message pad i think i
[01:53:40.660 --> 01:53:47.380]   think it was if i might be wrong but i think that it was first available around map world expo boston
[01:53:47.380 --> 01:53:51.860]   in august because i did buy it like the first day it was available they actually had tents set up
[01:53:51.860 --> 01:53:57.700]   you bought leech mirror nice yeah they really cool i used i i'm a former employee of leech mirror
[01:53:57.700 --> 01:54:03.940]   sales the the the long defunct but wonderful electronics and home uh home home appliance
[01:54:03.940 --> 01:54:11.860]   chain in new england they had a special tent set up i again still i still could barely afford it but
[01:54:11.860 --> 01:54:16.900]   it was like but i gotta have it now i bet i can get someone to send me a copy of like the development
[01:54:16.900 --> 01:54:23.060]   kit and i started learning newton script and man it was fun to do newton script it was it was a
[01:54:23.060 --> 01:54:28.820]   hell of a lot of fun i and i did like buy a pulley go to go to the go to the police supply store
[01:54:28.820 --> 01:54:34.020]   uh like a couple towns over test out the newton with a whole bunch of different like leather
[01:54:34.020 --> 01:54:40.820]   holsters and gun belts and like got some leather tools and adapted like a hip a hip belt so that
[01:54:40.820 --> 01:54:45.860]   i actually have it strapped down to my outer thigh and like draw it because otherwise like there's
[01:54:45.860 --> 01:54:50.500]   no way to actually have it handy when this is the thing that's supposed to be super super handy in
[01:54:50.500 --> 01:54:56.660]   your hand i'm sure you got a leech mirror employee discount but uh the the i was i was long i was
[01:54:56.660 --> 01:55:03.140]   long gone and i already like stolen as much as i i already i already my first mac was a 512k mac
[01:55:03.140 --> 01:55:08.100]   that that was originally sold for two thousand dollars it was a customer return but was in i
[01:55:08.100 --> 01:55:14.820]   worked the computer department and employees were allowed to make their own regular markdowns i just
[01:55:14.820 --> 01:55:20.020]   i i i removed some panels what looked worse than it actually was i disconnected a power thing
[01:55:20.020 --> 01:55:24.740]   so it wouldn't power on if someone tried it inevitably the calendar turned it down to
[01:55:24.740 --> 01:55:29.220]   seventy seven dollars and seventy seven cents and i bought it for seventy seven dollars and after
[01:55:29.220 --> 01:55:32.820]   five minutes in my house i was able to of course got it running again because i'm the one who
[01:55:32.820 --> 01:55:40.340]   disabled it began on sale august second 1993 for nine hundred dollars which was uh about
[01:55:40.340 --> 01:55:46.660]   eighteen hundred dollars uh today oh thank you look at that anthony has brought me my very expensive
[01:55:46.660 --> 01:55:51.860]   now that i know how much these are worth stack of newton message pads uh this is this is uh the
[01:55:51.860 --> 01:55:56.820]   first one i think was the one hundred no this the two thousand yeah this is the original one
[01:55:56.820 --> 01:56:02.820]   the one hundred and there were some really innovative things it would go when you threw away
[01:56:02.820 --> 01:56:08.340]   something crumpled it up it had an iconic interface this was before general before general magic right
[01:56:08.900 --> 01:56:14.260]   um it this is the bestest pad two thousand the later version of it that had the flip cover on it
[01:56:14.260 --> 01:56:19.700]   it had an optional keyboard yeah yeah and it had cards here's one let's pop it out and see what it
[01:56:19.700 --> 01:56:28.500]   does this is a two megabyte two megabyte two megabyte flash storage card i couldn't even get one of my
[01:56:28.500 --> 01:56:35.860]   photos from my camera on that uh today it cost as a Volvo yeah uh yeah these but but yet i i think we
[01:56:35.860 --> 01:56:39.860]   shouldn't mock it because in many ways this was again this was a huge
[01:56:39.860 --> 01:56:46.500]   invention that changed everything and we yeah and scully as nutty as he was was right about one
[01:56:46.500 --> 01:56:52.660]   thing pdas did become uh the way of the world but it just happened to be on your smartphone not on
[01:56:52.660 --> 01:56:57.300]   your yeah and you needed you need an internet connection to really take it off but i i got
[01:56:57.300 --> 01:57:03.140]   something missing on this although i think i do have on one of these my modem card do you remember
[01:57:03.140 --> 01:57:08.500]   that handy the oh yeah that the mobile modem card with a little pop little slide out connector
[01:57:08.500 --> 01:57:14.580]   that like unfolded for yeah here i'll show you i have it there's your modem card and here's the
[01:57:14.580 --> 01:57:19.700]   connector so this is so you can can you give me the over the shoulder uh again john this is so that
[01:57:19.700 --> 01:57:27.860]   you could take your rj uh 11 and put it in can you see that put it in there that just pops out and
[01:57:27.860 --> 01:57:35.860]   you put your phone jack in send and receive emails or faxes fax modem card oh good somebody was
[01:57:35.860 --> 01:57:41.220]   asking this is an xjack this is this is my megahertz this is not from apple somebody was asking me
[01:57:41.220 --> 01:57:47.860]   so yeah this one this one's loaded this has two megabytes of memory and a modem card so i'm ready
[01:57:47.860 --> 01:57:53.220]   to go boy that is and the nice thing is these use batteries so actually i could just put some
[01:57:53.220 --> 01:57:58.740]   batteries in here and yeah i got i got to tell my neil gameon story though it's a great
[01:57:58.740 --> 01:58:03.540]   my my one my favorite interactions probably with with the newton but also with other things so
[01:58:03.540 --> 01:58:11.140]   sandman the the comic was in its early days so much so that like when uh sand when neil gameon
[01:58:11.140 --> 01:58:17.780]   and dave keith that the art cover artist well we're could have a so assigning at at uh uh at the
[01:58:17.780 --> 01:58:24.900]   comic store in uh kenmore square in boston without having 10 000 people like basically creating like
[01:58:24.900 --> 01:58:31.380]   a health problem uh but so waited still had a wait in line outside you know to to get in and i decided
[01:58:31.380 --> 01:58:36.820]   that no i i want him to sign my newton message pad and just and so i created a new note had that like
[01:58:36.820 --> 01:58:41.460]   waiting for waiting for when i when i saw him in line when i finally got to the front of the line
[01:58:41.460 --> 01:58:48.660]   and so but what i forgot to do is turn off or no conversion no exactly so so you can so you can
[01:58:48.660 --> 01:58:52.980]   either have like if you could either do it as ink in which you're doing sketches or whatever or you
[01:58:52.980 --> 01:58:59.060]   could turn on the text and would do uh text to uh handwriting text so so we have a chat actually
[01:58:59.060 --> 01:59:03.540]   and we we were internet friends or copy serve comics and animation forum friends we had like
[01:59:03.540 --> 01:59:07.940]   some conversations about that so he signs his name and then he suddenly gets confused because
[01:59:07.940 --> 01:59:14.900]   like before his eyes like his signature was being transformed into words farm so he signs it again
[01:59:14.900 --> 01:59:18.820]   and he signs it again so oh my god is this wonderful it's like consulting the oracle
[01:59:18.820 --> 01:59:28.100]   and dovefly and to this to this day i have i have an original like poem like a five six seven eight
[01:59:28.100 --> 01:59:33.300]   line poem written by neil gaiman without his knowledge even he doesn't know what this poem is
[01:59:33.300 --> 01:59:38.100]   it's known only to my message pad and me oh that's beautiful oh that was just
[01:59:38.100 --> 01:59:43.780]   one is that you ever turn on ink and get the signature or no i think i think i did i think uh
[01:59:43.780 --> 01:59:50.500]   dave was more i i dave was not interested dave was more interested in playing with it as a pda then as
[01:59:50.500 --> 01:59:55.380]   like oh i'm gonna do a brilliant piece of like sandman style art with this
[01:59:55.380 --> 02:00:00.980]   stylist i've never seen before uh but yeah it was it was a great day but i will say the part of the
[02:00:00.980 --> 02:00:07.540]   part of the uh the dodge of of my job is that sometimes it's like oh well i've i've you know i've
[02:00:07.540 --> 02:00:13.060]   i just came here to get get your autograph in my book mr author that i really really love but yes
[02:00:13.060 --> 02:00:17.380]   i if you'd like to play with my google glass that i happen to be wearing but by all means and so i
[02:00:17.380 --> 02:00:21.460]   get to talk to this person for ten minutes because they've never seen google glass before they never
[02:00:21.460 --> 02:00:26.340]   seen an ipad before i got i got so many i got so many sketches oh i'm sorry i'm going off
[02:00:26.340 --> 02:00:32.420]   to tangent i'll i'll end it's here but like the first comic con i went to with my first ipad
[02:00:32.420 --> 02:00:37.700]   was like i got so many really good sketches from artists simply because like they had never
[02:00:37.700 --> 02:00:42.180]   seen an ipad before and they themselves were curious about how would do for doing art so i've
[02:00:42.180 --> 02:00:48.100]   got like i've got this whole folder on my original ipad of like brilliant works of art that i try
[02:00:48.100 --> 02:00:52.020]   to then both geez it is technically you did a sketch for me can i give you like 10 or 20 bucks no no
[02:00:52.020 --> 02:00:56.900]   i have to so what do you think look up what are the art programs for how can i export it so again
[02:00:56.900 --> 02:01:03.780]   it was it was it's an icebreaker is what it is it's an icebreaker here from august 27th 1993 is a
[02:01:03.780 --> 02:01:10.820]   dunesbury cartoon this is also in the artist tennica article uh he's uh the the uh what's his name mike
[02:01:10.820 --> 02:01:17.780]   dunesbury's writing i am writing a test sentence to which the newton converts siam fighting atomic
[02:01:17.780 --> 02:01:22.180]   century so he says no no he writes it again i am writing a test sentence
[02:01:22.180 --> 02:01:29.860]   ean is writing a taste sensation i am writing a test sentence i am writing a test sentence
[02:01:29.860 --> 02:01:36.420]   catching on egg freckles and then the simpsons had a similar one
[02:01:36.420 --> 02:01:42.980]   uh in which uh i think home a bard is writing beat up martin and uh it interprets it eat up
[02:01:42.980 --> 02:01:49.700]   martha but that's actually not too far off it wasn't the best hand-reading recognition in fact that's how
[02:01:49.700 --> 02:01:57.540]   uh the palm made its name was uh they very wisely realized that instead of trying to get the
[02:01:57.540 --> 02:02:04.580]   computer to understand quirky human handwriting have a special alphabet and the graffiti alphabet
[02:02:04.580 --> 02:02:08.900]   actually made the palm usable now machine learning just does it all for us and now it works yep
[02:02:08.900 --> 02:02:15.460]   yeah yeah it wrote it ran its own custom operating system newton o s written in c plus plus it had its
[02:02:15.460 --> 02:02:22.340]   own language newton script which lets you write uh apps uh you don't have to install the apps from
[02:02:22.340 --> 02:02:30.420]   an app store you just beam them onto the newton so it's i have to say i uh even though this was not a
[02:02:30.420 --> 02:02:36.980]   jobs this was a steve ska jim janskullie steve skullie what's his name skullie john skullie
[02:02:36.980 --> 02:02:42.740]   this was a john skullie uh special uh it was also i think a very important step forward in the
[02:02:42.740 --> 02:02:52.660]   computing that led to as some of you may remember the uh 2100 and then the e-mate remember this for
[02:02:52.660 --> 02:03:01.860]   school a couple of years later um and now it's pretty cheap i'm surprised yeah uh the newton's
[02:03:01.860 --> 02:03:07.860]   legacy newton says hello to the iphone the iphone says hello back you can still people are still
[02:03:07.860 --> 02:03:13.540]   working on the newton to keep it working yeah there's there's people they they've written uh uh
[02:03:13.540 --> 02:03:18.420]   internet stacks for it you can actually write uh they have web servers for it written for it
[02:03:18.420 --> 02:03:22.980]   it's there's there's nothing there is nothing that has nothing do not have any device ever made
[02:03:22.980 --> 02:03:29.060]   that has a system clock and at least five bits of ram that has not does not have a army of people
[02:03:29.060 --> 02:03:33.780]   are still writing new modern software for it and as uh as jeremy rimer writing in arse techinec
[02:03:33.780 --> 02:03:38.900]   points out for that three million dollar investment in the acorn risk machine cpu apple got something
[02:03:38.900 --> 02:03:45.140]   yep pretty good a few 30 years later that's that's when that's when risk was actually
[02:03:45.140 --> 02:03:49.700]   like innovative and new while i'll reduce instructions like computing like how could that work
[02:03:49.700 --> 02:03:53.940]   until where it's just how could i how can you do something powerful with just a small set of
[02:03:53.940 --> 02:03:58.580]   instructions both that's the point it's a small set of instructions that run super super fast and
[02:03:58.580 --> 02:04:04.180]   efficiently all right we're going to take a little time out and then your picks of the week uh
[02:04:04.180 --> 02:04:11.060]   gentlemen so prepare them if you will as i tell the world about our sponsor wealth front and now
[02:04:11.060 --> 02:04:17.940]   is a very important time i think to know about wealth front the ups and downs of the stock market
[02:04:17.940 --> 02:04:25.620]   uh uh or of bitcoin or of nft's might be making you a little queasy right now stock training yeah
[02:04:25.620 --> 02:04:32.100]   it's a wild ride uh but the thrill of risking it all is probably best enjoyed in moderation like
[02:04:32.100 --> 02:04:38.660]   casino gambling and eating questionable street food if you're playing the market i hope for your sake
[02:04:38.660 --> 02:04:44.580]   you're also stashing some safer money in a place like wealth front you know you hear about the people
[02:04:44.580 --> 02:04:50.260]   made a lot of money on crypto or day trading but there's wealth from us a ton of data to show the
[02:04:50.260 --> 02:04:57.300]   time in the market almost always beats timing the market it's very hard to know when to buy and
[02:04:57.300 --> 02:05:01.940]   sell you have to kind of guess but with with wealth right you're not doing that you're you're

[02:06:33.700 --> 02:06:42.660]   let's start off with the high price spread Alex Lindsey to begin oh it's not that bad
[02:06:42.660 --> 02:06:50.260]   oh good not that bad oh you're right it's not why it's not even a full Alex yeah no so it's mostly
[02:06:50.260 --> 02:06:55.460]   introducing just the concept that I thought was fascinating which is that so a lot of the lights
[02:06:55.460 --> 02:06:59.060]   that we buy and you can buy lights that are only 20 or 30 dollars they don't have to be really
[02:06:59.060 --> 02:07:04.980]   expensive but the expensive lights have the same system which is called DMX so DMX is how you uh
[02:07:04.980 --> 02:07:14.020]   it it'll have up to 500 per universe 512 signals and one light might be eight of those you know
[02:07:14.020 --> 02:07:20.580]   which is like your color the brightness that type of thing and so it's really powerful and we use
[02:07:20.580 --> 02:07:25.060]   it for a lot of things in the concerts that I work on it's now we control our lights here right
[02:07:25.060 --> 02:07:30.660]   John we use DMX yeah yeah and and so the thing is is that they always have a DMX board like there's
[02:07:30.660 --> 02:07:35.780]   some board somewhere that you have to use to to do this and you're always like there's got to be
[02:07:35.780 --> 02:07:40.020]   an easier way well it turns out that there is the one that I'm going to show you here is made by
[02:07:40.020 --> 02:07:46.580]   Shave this is a little this little box here it's kind of magical it has ethernet on one side in power
[02:07:46.580 --> 02:07:52.900]   and then and then you have the the three pin you can get five pin as well but don't don't bother
[02:07:52.900 --> 02:07:59.220]   with the five pin there's just that no one uses the extra pins anyway so the um but three pin or five
[02:07:59.220 --> 02:08:05.700]   pin in this little box will basically let you run an ethernet cable somewhere and then send those
[02:08:05.700 --> 02:08:10.820]   ethernet those those DMX commands now you can have the rest of the lights all be you know on some
[02:08:10.820 --> 02:08:14.660]   kind of you know connected in series and so they get also they get all the good stuff that you can
[02:08:14.660 --> 02:08:19.380]   control two lights with this but but you control the whole system with it as well if you just recommend
[02:08:19.380 --> 02:08:24.100]   they're all connected and this is basically I mean for short connections you can even use XLR but the
[02:08:24.580 --> 02:08:30.260]   technically the the um resistance is different so so you you don't want to go very far with that
[02:08:30.260 --> 02:08:36.980]   but it's but the the connectors look exactly like XLR um and so the um anyway so then you just
[02:08:36.980 --> 02:08:42.900]   you can just tie your lights together and now that you now you can control everything on a you so you
[02:08:42.900 --> 02:08:48.260]   take one of these boxes and throw it up on a in your rear in your somewhere and then and then kind
[02:08:48.260 --> 02:08:52.500]   of you know just just a daisy chain the rest of the the lights with it and then start giving them
[02:08:52.500 --> 02:08:56.900]   you know the lights all have their own addresses and you can just tell them what to do and it's
[02:08:56.900 --> 02:09:02.420]   really I meant to I was trying I just ran out of this so much cheaper than a big fancy DMX controller
[02:09:02.420 --> 02:09:07.700]   and uh and there's and there's a reliable but you have to have the software right well you still have
[02:09:07.700 --> 02:09:12.900]   something to control it and so we use things like is a isadora but made by um you know so so isadora
[02:09:12.900 --> 02:09:20.180]   is a piece of software that can talk DMX you know and it's um and so uh that's made by Trichotronics
[02:09:20.180 --> 02:09:26.980]   and and and they they uh they that's what a lot of stage folks use you know they can design these
[02:09:26.980 --> 02:09:31.620]   incredible things it can it can react to things around it and so it's a very really complex software
[02:09:31.620 --> 02:09:37.140]   but there's also iPad apps that will do it that are just talk they talk IP so they get to talk IP
[02:09:37.140 --> 02:09:42.020]   to this but they're sending DMX commands out so you can have your iPad control all your lights and
[02:09:42.020 --> 02:09:47.460]   everything else as well and so it's a it's a really I mean DMX is uh I'm learning more and more about
[02:09:47.460 --> 02:09:51.940]   it as we do more of these shows that I'm working on and it's just it's just incredible like what
[02:09:51.940 --> 02:09:57.620]   you can do with it and so um anyway that but it really there was something about this that when I
[02:09:57.620 --> 02:10:02.660]   realized that I could take the IP and turn it back into DMX I didn't have to use a hardware
[02:10:02.660 --> 02:10:08.660]   controller um I got pretty excited so we we've got there's um this one is is a good one um I also
[02:10:08.660 --> 02:10:14.180]   have once there's a one called DMX King and N-Tech but they seem to be out of stock um so um so but
[02:10:14.180 --> 02:10:21.140]   these are these are super hard this is available now on Sweetwater wow yeah so that's really um so
[02:10:21.140 --> 02:10:26.420]   you could each light is an individual light on an IP network and that you can connect them all
[02:10:26.420 --> 02:10:30.900]   together with this box and then connect computer to this and now and then control all of them now
[02:10:30.900 --> 02:10:36.660]   you got granular control of each light we and the thing is is that like with Isadora which is the
[02:10:36.660 --> 02:10:41.460]   software that a lot of a lot of stage folks use to do this you can do things like we have it like
[02:10:41.460 --> 02:10:47.860]   if someone you can have it uh if you see motion over here turn this light on or if you get um if
[02:10:47.860 --> 02:10:52.100]   someone joins we have one where you can we I think we did one a while ago where if someone
[02:10:52.100 --> 02:10:56.340]   because we're using zoom osc which lets us know everything about what's happening in zoom if
[02:10:56.340 --> 02:11:00.980]   this person joins just turn the light on just let you know that this person's now in the event
[02:11:00.980 --> 02:11:05.620]   you know and and so those are all kinds of things that you hate you can set all if this then that
[02:11:05.620 --> 02:11:09.940]   kind of stuff with DMX I mean that's not if this in that but but the bottom line is is that you can
[02:11:09.940 --> 02:11:16.980]   create all kinds of um very complex interactions um that are tied into the DMX and much more yeah
[02:11:16.980 --> 02:11:22.340]   yeah this is isadora which I've recommended in the past oh yes um is incredibly powerful
[02:11:22.340 --> 02:11:29.140]   software for running all of this and then we output it from there to uh um you know that DMX
[02:11:29.140 --> 02:11:35.220]   is one of the languages it speaks along with osc and rest and you know all kinds of other things so
[02:11:35.220 --> 02:11:39.620]   so it it speaks many many things but all those lights that you're seeing in that demo
[02:11:39.620 --> 02:11:44.900]   let's see if they show the demo there um those are all like all those lights there and all those
[02:11:44.900 --> 02:11:52.020]   controls that's all DMX controlled even audio you mix drill with DMX right um usually use osc for
[02:11:52.020 --> 02:11:56.580]   that that's open sound sound control so osc is really more of the audio and some of the other
[02:11:56.580 --> 02:12:01.060]   stuff and then um but but and then projection can be controlled there's a lot of things that can
[02:12:01.060 --> 02:12:06.660]   be done this is the kind of this is a low code um you know visual programming interface for
[02:12:06.660 --> 02:12:13.540]   theater wow and so and mark that's mark and he's a genius it all starts for a long time
[02:12:13.540 --> 02:12:17.380]   so we have a DMX which I think breaks a lot
[02:12:17.380 --> 02:12:23.860]   no it's pretty reliable now when we first got it I think we went through a few of them john but
[02:12:23.860 --> 02:12:28.340]   it's okay now okay good but uh this would be a lot easier just do it like have an iPad and
[02:12:28.340 --> 02:12:32.580]   control it on the iPad you definitely can have iPads control especially you you guys are doing
[02:12:32.580 --> 02:12:36.260]   yeah it's simple you simple operation we just have pre-programmed slots for each show
[02:12:36.260 --> 02:12:42.660]   so john can press a button go ahead do it just show show us so so we could be uh you know some other
[02:12:42.660 --> 02:12:50.900]   show with the lighting take over twig yeah exactly i guess it's not working it's fever never mind
[02:12:50.900 --> 02:13:01.140]   i guess we can't do that very good the chivet deejay DMX it whoa there we go there we go now i'm green
[02:13:01.140 --> 02:13:06.900]   light switch wave all it all happens at once with and then he has just one button on the DMX
[02:13:06.900 --> 02:13:11.220]   controller that does it you set it all up ahead of time with the faders and stuff or do it in software
[02:13:11.220 --> 02:13:17.700]   which makes a lot of sense yeah cool very cool fun so oh now we're getting fancy welcome to the
[02:13:17.700 --> 02:13:24.020]   light show andy and i go your pick of the week uh mind is something that you might have heard of
[02:13:24.020 --> 02:13:28.260]   you might not have if you haven't you should here have heard of it if you have heard of it this is
[02:13:28.260 --> 02:13:32.580]   a recommendation of something that will make it even more useful uh there is a i guess you call
[02:13:32.580 --> 02:13:37.860]   the movement called buy nothing and so if you go to usually well that's not gonna work for me at all
[02:13:37.860 --> 02:13:45.700]   yeah but but it's a it's a wonderful idea yeah it's a wonderful kind of social contract sort of
[02:13:45.700 --> 02:13:50.820]   thing where the it's again it's mostly a facebook thing where that's how it started where you join
[02:13:50.820 --> 02:13:55.780]   the buy nothing facebook group for your community and so if like i'm right now i'm looking at like
[02:13:55.780 --> 02:14:00.180]   a dresser that i don't need anymore i've had it for 10 years it's outlived its purpose but still
[02:14:00.180 --> 02:14:06.740]   very very good and a it's too big for me to haul out to the dump it's not worth my trying to sell it
[02:14:06.740 --> 02:14:12.740]   like on craigslist or whatever and i actually it's too nice to not go to somebody who needs one so i
[02:14:12.740 --> 02:14:18.100]   could just go to the local buy nothing facebook group post couple pictures saying hey anybody wants
[02:14:18.100 --> 02:14:24.180]   this uh message me and we'll arrange it you can come and pick it up or or constantly
[02:14:24.180 --> 02:14:30.580]   consequently if there's like if i'm looking to refurnish my my office and i just want as many
[02:14:30.580 --> 02:14:35.220]   bookcases i can get my hands on i might just keep an eye on that group and see people who have again
[02:14:35.220 --> 02:14:40.660]   are getting rid of bookcases and i will rent maybe rent a car rent a truck from uhall and just basically
[02:14:40.660 --> 02:14:44.580]   spend the day going to three different places that i've arranged to pick up the bookcases that
[02:14:44.580 --> 02:14:50.020]   they need to get rid of it's nice but the only the only problem is that it's on facebook and it's
[02:14:50.020 --> 02:14:55.780]   not the most easy thing to navigate because it's just scroll scroll scroll scroll but the last year
[02:14:55.780 --> 02:15:00.420]   they they released a really good app for the iphone and also android but we're talking about the iphone
[02:15:00.420 --> 02:15:06.100]   here where it really is just give them give them your location give them a radius and now it really
[02:15:06.100 --> 02:15:10.260]   is just when you fire up the app because you're just bored it will show you all the people that
[02:15:10.260 --> 02:15:14.580]   have something that they want to get rid of or people who are saying hey i need a i'm
[02:15:14.580 --> 02:15:20.740]   my my nephew is just getting started out he needs furniture i especially need a bureau
[02:15:20.740 --> 02:15:24.180]   i can just say hey i've got a bureau here's my you know here message me here's an address and
[02:15:24.180 --> 02:15:28.100]   you can come pick it up anytime you want it's a really really great thing that i love the motives
[02:15:28.100 --> 02:15:33.540]   of it it really is just all about there are so many situations exactly like that where you have
[02:15:33.540 --> 02:15:37.460]   something that is too good to throw away or too cumbersome to throw away and you know someone else
[02:15:37.460 --> 02:15:43.620]   can have value of it you don't even want to bother trying to get $50 for it on a yard sale or something
[02:15:43.620 --> 02:15:47.860]   you just want a it out of your house and be the pleasure of knowing that someone else is making
[02:15:47.860 --> 02:15:52.820]   good use out of it who needed this thing and buy nothing is really a great way to do that and the
[02:15:52.820 --> 02:15:58.660]   app is it's kind of fun in your community too i i installed it a few weeks ago and i learned to
[02:15:58.660 --> 02:16:03.860]   have to make sure it i turn off the lizard part of my brain because it's like you know i don't need
[02:16:03.860 --> 02:16:09.860]   a console stereo but i bet i could turn that into like a plex server i could replace the speakers
[02:16:09.860 --> 02:16:18.340]   with andy it's a big huge magnavox cabinet made out of like blonde wood from 1963 it takes you
[02:16:18.340 --> 02:16:22.660]   have no space to put it and it will sit in the house for two years until you do anything with it
[02:16:22.660 --> 02:16:27.540]   or put it back on buy nothing leave it alone but it's it's it's fun it's fun to see what people
[02:16:27.540 --> 02:16:33.780]   are doing it it's especially good if you live in a college town and because i do live near
[02:16:33.780 --> 02:16:41.060]   i've always lived like kind of near colleges and it's like really you have a 45 inch like sony like
[02:16:41.060 --> 02:16:48.180]   really good tv and you're just about to toss it really you know like you're gonna go to school
[02:16:48.180 --> 02:16:53.860]   the fall is probably gonna get a 65 inch this thing doesn't have HDR like oh you yes i will take
[02:16:53.860 --> 02:17:02.100]   your free 45 inch tv absolutely and this is why andy has 7 45 inch television sales we use it i mean
[02:17:02.100 --> 02:17:08.580]   i'm using it as an alternative to daylight i used to do yard work for a woman who had a very
[02:17:08.580 --> 02:17:13.060]   large house and the only we got paid i don't know it was like five bucks an hour to do it this is
[02:17:13.060 --> 02:17:17.940]   that in the mid-eighties and the the big the big thing was we got dumpster dive at their head
[02:17:17.940 --> 02:17:23.060]   stuff away they had their own little dump and there was just all these things that they threw
[02:17:23.060 --> 02:17:29.060]   away that i was like this is really i mean my alarm clock for like half a decade was something
[02:17:29.060 --> 02:17:34.820]   i pulled out of the trash um but uh andy like the my obsession right now is turning very old radios
[02:17:34.820 --> 02:17:40.500]   like i'm just starting to do the research turning very old like 50s 30s 40s radios and then
[02:17:40.500 --> 02:17:47.540]   souping them up with like raspberry pies inside so the knobs still should work but then that sounds
[02:17:47.540 --> 02:17:52.740]   like you know anyway so i'm it's actually easier to get radios from the 1930s than it is to get
[02:17:52.740 --> 02:17:58.100]   raspberry pies so that should tell you something it is i i see them all the time like my my kids
[02:17:58.100 --> 02:18:02.180]   for and i for some reason go to antique stores just to kind of wander around and look at stuff
[02:18:02.180 --> 02:18:06.340]   and um and so you see those radios all the time when we built the brick house for some reason
[02:18:06.340 --> 02:18:11.540]   roger ambros are a designer just he he's discovered the pedalome antique stores
[02:18:11.540 --> 02:18:18.340]   and i was in in the military have you been down to the military museum oh yeah in the basement
[02:18:18.340 --> 02:18:26.900]   like he says father works there so who whose father works there lisa's father go to the jerry
[02:18:26.900 --> 02:18:32.260]   rosen thaw's booth there he'll get you some good deals i might i might have talked to him this weekend
[02:18:32.260 --> 02:18:36.260]   we were just there we were just just wandering through the bed it's so funny because he's basically
[02:18:36.260 --> 02:18:42.020]   he collects crap and then that's the military museum is really a bunch of booths for different
[02:18:42.020 --> 02:18:47.620]   people who collect crap selling crap and uh that's how it's uh that that one is actually a
[02:18:47.620 --> 02:18:52.900]   particularly good antique store i always say that there's a lot of stuff over the years i
[02:18:52.900 --> 02:18:57.380]   become connoisseur because my my daughter and i go to him like almost every week oh my god yeah
[02:18:57.380 --> 02:19:02.740]   he's above he's not in the basement where he's in the uh in fact it's like this third booth on the
[02:19:02.740 --> 02:19:08.100]   left as you go in i'm probably i was walking through it jerry rosen thaw look for him yeah
[02:19:08.100 --> 02:19:14.100]   it's uh it's this booth at the pedalome military museum it's crazy that you go down you go downstairs
[02:19:14.100 --> 02:19:18.020]   and then there's a there's like it's all military parapherna you go to a corner and there's a museum
[02:19:18.020 --> 02:19:24.900]   yeah with jeeps yeah well it's pretty wild yeah somebody drove into the storefront you know accidentally
[02:19:24.900 --> 02:19:31.140]   turn like this and platted in the storefront a few years ago but other than that that maybe
[02:19:31.140 --> 02:19:37.620]   that's how the jeep got there uh yeah i had a green put a price tag on it i had to take off the
[02:19:37.620 --> 02:19:42.100]   plate honestly i take it i had to buy some i had to buy some little lights at the dj store and then i
[02:19:42.100 --> 02:19:46.020]   had then i oh yeah the dj store another store i don't understand how that stays in business
[02:19:46.820 --> 02:19:52.660]   it's on the main street of you of pedalomas like the people people like me wandering in my
[02:19:52.660 --> 02:19:56.100]   two thousand dollars worth of lights without asking anything this is like yeah i need those
[02:19:56.100 --> 02:20:01.380]   like they get all sorts of stuff there what do we buy there my mic stand comes from there look at that
[02:20:01.380 --> 02:20:08.980]   yeah yeah there you go why downtown pedalomas is strangest place i got to tell you the military
[02:20:08.980 --> 02:20:14.500]   museum and the mic stand it's i i live in nirvana it's pretty cool pedalomas is pretty cool it's a lot
[02:20:14.500 --> 02:20:18.740]   very happy let me tell you yeah i love it it's good it's good downtown hey when uh when georgia
[02:20:18.740 --> 02:20:25.140]   down was on twit on sunday she talked about her brand new nebula class and guess who else has a
[02:20:25.140 --> 02:20:31.620]   nebula class rene richy that's when when i went to new york for that tuesday that i had to miss
[02:20:31.620 --> 02:20:35.620]   here this is what you were doing that's secret it's announced yet so we couldn't say
[02:20:35.620 --> 02:20:40.980]   how exciting so this is the equivalent of a masterclass what's yours about
[02:20:42.180 --> 02:20:46.420]   mine is about rapid turnaround video because one of the things i had to learn to do especially at i
[02:20:46.420 --> 02:20:50.260]   more is we didn't have a big like we didn't have like four five people at an event like the verge of
[02:20:50.260 --> 02:20:56.020]   some of the bigger uh outlets did so i had to figure out for breaking views for live events for like
[02:20:56.020 --> 02:21:00.660]   they would give us embargoes uh for 24 hours like basically the embargo lifted the next morning and
[02:21:00.660 --> 02:21:07.540]   i had to figure out how to do like an embargoed review or coverage in no time no time at all so here
[02:21:07.540 --> 02:21:12.740]   i go through everything that i learned about like what prep you can do before an event all
[02:21:12.740 --> 02:21:18.020]   stuff you need to get together and then what to capture during an event or a review period and
[02:21:18.020 --> 02:21:22.420]   then like how to edit it like as quickly as possible and just to make sure that you use every
[02:21:22.420 --> 02:21:27.620]   moment of time that you actually have when it comes to to wrap a turnaround video oh this oh there's
[02:21:27.620 --> 02:21:34.980]   serenity this is really good because uh this is a skill and more and more people are uh are
[02:21:34.980 --> 02:21:41.380]   needed this so this so you pay you pay what two two dollars a month for this so this is i think
[02:21:41.380 --> 02:21:46.180]   it's it's ten dollars a month but uh if you go to nebula classes dot com slash when i reach you i
[02:21:46.180 --> 02:21:51.700]   think there's a discount yes um friends of red a Richie uh joy a discount of two dollars a month
[02:21:51.700 --> 02:21:55.940]   well we're all your friends yes so very nice absolutely and then you get all the other nebula
[02:21:55.940 --> 02:22:01.220]   stuff at the same time you get all the originals exclusives uh bonus videos no ads no small all
[02:22:01.220 --> 02:22:06.500]   that kind of stuff uh you you get as well so it's and we're we're building like george's class came
[02:22:06.500 --> 02:22:10.820]   out this Tuesday my class came out last week tom is frank we'll teach you how to be like most
[02:22:10.820 --> 02:22:14.260]   people don't know business as a creator they have no like they can make videos but they don't know
[02:22:14.260 --> 02:22:19.380]   actually like how to make a living uh devin stone who's legal eagle who's fantastic has had it
[02:22:19.380 --> 02:22:23.700]   how to sue like a lawyer because he decided like most people don't know how to actually sue somebody
[02:22:23.700 --> 02:22:30.340]   um but there's like so much really really good this is neat i just i just want to endorse that i
[02:22:30.340 --> 02:22:35.780]   for so i just i finally i just discovered legal eagle like over the weekend and i was binge watching
[02:22:35.780 --> 02:22:40.980]   every single one of his breakdowns of like my cousin vinnie like now he's a he's a real lawyer
[02:22:40.980 --> 02:22:44.500]   and he's kind of basically breakdown everything that's going on in the trial scenes what what they
[02:22:44.500 --> 02:22:50.820]   did right what they did wrong uh and yeah i just and really that's how i was broken last week yes
[02:22:50.820 --> 02:22:55.540]   yes like we're tom cruis here's four different ways he should be getting the death penalty for
[02:22:55.540 --> 02:23:00.020]   what he's doing so a lot of these a lot of these guys are youtube creators rene is that they're all
[02:23:00.020 --> 02:23:04.180]   it's all youtubers like sam from when he does wind over and twice a half is interesting and he
[02:23:04.180 --> 02:23:08.340]   talks about so it's everything what is nebulas we've learned what is nebula's plan is like they
[02:23:08.340 --> 02:23:13.620]   want to make kind of a grassroots masterclass kind of a thing uh with these yeah it's for creators
[02:23:13.620 --> 02:23:18.100]   bike creators because i hope i just stuff with the creator economy felt like vc bros trying to come
[02:23:18.100 --> 02:23:22.580]   in and rift creators like take everything from us yeah um and we want to do like basically what
[02:23:22.580 --> 02:23:26.420]   you're doing is like it's it's completely run by creators it's all four creators creators and
[02:23:26.420 --> 02:23:30.740]   equity in everything uh and then we want to make like the most amazing stuff that we can make
[02:23:30.740 --> 02:23:37.380]   together i love it and you have a roku app a google app an app store app and amazon's uh app so that
[02:23:37.380 --> 02:23:42.340]   you can watch these in an app you can watch these on the web wrap it turn around video that's great
[02:23:42.340 --> 02:23:48.580]   rene i am this is great i'm it's fun to see nebulae nebula really kind of grow and take off nebula
[02:23:48.580 --> 02:23:55.220]   dot app to find out more yeah we're trying 500 500 000 subscribers now on nebulae that's wonderful
[02:23:55.220 --> 02:24:01.220]   for us that is really great and i love it because you've basically built on the free platform that
[02:24:01.220 --> 02:24:06.340]   youtube gives you so yeah we look at it like an expansion pack it's like youtube is really good
[02:24:06.340 --> 02:24:11.300]   at some things but uh like for youtube to really work you have to think of it like you have to
[02:24:11.300 --> 02:24:16.980]   have a show so like you can have the same actor in malcolm in the middle and in um i forget the
[02:24:16.980 --> 02:24:22.500]   one where he plays a meth dealer uh the uh ramp liking on the name breaking bad yeah you can like
[02:24:22.500 --> 02:24:26.580]   the same act can be both those shows but they can't be in the same show or the audience gets really
[02:24:26.580 --> 02:24:30.740]   confused yes so youtube is and audiences are really good when you like mac break weekly every
[02:24:30.740 --> 02:24:35.380]   week you watch it you get mac stuff it's not like a random topic every week but a lot of us have
[02:24:35.380 --> 02:24:39.380]   multiple interests and there are people who are interested in us as creators and that doesn't do
[02:24:39.380 --> 02:24:43.700]   well on youtube also some of the people do like world war two historical stuff which
[02:24:43.700 --> 02:24:47.860]   doesn't do well on youtube there's or like there's just a bunch of things that youtube isn't great
[02:24:47.860 --> 02:24:51.700]   at so we do this stuff on youtube that works really well there and if you're invested in us
[02:24:51.700 --> 02:24:55.540]   you can go get all the stuff that doesn't work great on youtube over on this platform that we're
[02:24:55.540 --> 02:25:01.540]   doing on our own it's very smart that's very very smart yeah also it's good not to be too beholden
[02:25:01.540 --> 02:25:06.180]   to any one platform like youtube so it's good to have that that's how it started because it was
[02:25:06.180 --> 02:25:10.820]   during the great demonetization right here uh and a bunch of educational channels because for a
[02:25:10.820 --> 02:25:16.420]   variety of reasons uh got completely you know decimated during that time right and so this was
[02:25:16.420 --> 02:25:20.420]   one of the ideas that we figured could help insulate us against that happening again awesome
[02:25:20.420 --> 02:25:25.860]   renebula signed up i just you know you're just they just turned me ten bucks by first month
[02:25:25.860 --> 02:25:30.900]   go to oh you should you know andy nebulah classes dot com slash rene richie
