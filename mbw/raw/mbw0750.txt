[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.240]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly. Great panel for you. Of course, Renee Ritchie is here, Andy Inako.
[00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:10.320]   Kelly Guima from the Mac Observer joins us. We'll be talking about Apple's quarterly results.
[00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:15.280]   They're coming out tomorrow. Should be the best quarter ever for Apple. At least that's what the
[00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:22.240]   stock market thinks. Some new watch to celebrate Black History Month and a big change upstairs in
[00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:27.520]   the executive at Apple. What does that mean for future products? We have a great discussion
[00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:33.760]   all coming up next on Mac Break Weekly. Our annual Twitch survey is going strong but there's only a
[00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:40.800]   week or two left. We don't want to miss your feedback. So here's what you do. Go to twit.tv/survey21
[00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.120]   and take it now before it closes next week. The survey helps us understand our audience
[00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:50.000]   so we can make your listening experience even better. It shouldn't take more than a few minutes
[00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:56.640]   and you can skip any questions. You don't want to answer that's fine. Just go to twit.tv/survey21
[00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:06.800]   thanks in advance. Podcasts you love from people you trust. This is twit.

[00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:59.840]   latest Apple news news from Apple. In this case there's one news story in about 12 rumors but that's
[00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:06.080]   okay. That's part of the fun isn't it? There's more multiple news stories. Because some of the
[00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:15.840]   rumors are really good rumors. As I've always said it's great. It's not great for in terms of hard
[00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:19.360]   news but it's good that we can say whatever we want and not technically be wrong.
[00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:24.720]   There you go. Also happy Sesquik's Chinquis Centenary of Mac Break Weekly.
[00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:33.280]   This is the Sesquik's Cenciu Chinquis Centenary. There is some argument over what it is.
[00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:40.960]   Our 150th year in Chobiz. No. 15th episode.
[00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:46.320]   700 Sesquik's Chinquis Centenary.
[00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:48.560]   Chinquis is the Italian isn't it?
[00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:53.680]   It's the Italian. I was looking this up and trying to find out what the official word is
[00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:57.280]   because I figure in England things are actually that old so they must have come up with it.
[00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:02.080]   But there's no consensus on what a 750 you have to piece it together from
[00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:09.760]   okay. Here's what the 500th would be. So here is what half so it would be half of a 500th plus
[00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:13.520]   a 500th and at some point I gave up.
[00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:20.400]   Here is the... There are a lot of these. This is from Wikipedia. You got your annual,
[00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:26.160]   your biennial, your triennial. It's going to take me a while to get to 750. But when we're talking
[00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:30.720]   years there you're right. There's nothing between Sept centennial and Octo-Setenary.
[00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:34.080]   So we need a little something in between for 750.
[00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:35.920]   Come up with it for Queen Elizabeth pretty soon.
[00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:37.520]   Exactly. That's what I said.
[00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:39.920]   Sasquatch Centennial.
[00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:44.240]   So that's what it is. Oh ladies and gentlemen well first of all Renee Richie.
[00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:48.080]   But I have hi Renee. YouTube.com/ReneeRitchie. Andy and I go to BGBH.
[00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:52.640]   But we got to say hi to Kelly Guimann who hasn't been on in 170 years.
[00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:58.720]   This is her sex centenary septennial. No I don't know. It's been a while but it's great to see you
[00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:01.200]   Kelly. Hi it's nice to be here again.
[00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:07.120]   What are you up to these days? Not a lot. That's like the rest of us.
[00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:11.440]   Yeah we're staying home. Yeah. Staying home real hard. That's about that's most of it.
[00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:18.320]   Yep. Watching a lot of TV. You got... Oops. You got... That's my screen. There's Kelly.
[00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:24.400]   You got your T-Mobile thing you do. What is it TMO? Daily observations.
[00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:29.680]   Daily. The Daily Observations podcast. So every weekday we talk about the news of the day or some
[00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:35.920]   tips and on Fridays we do Security Friday and talk about this weekend data breaches and
[00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:39.200]   what Facebook's up to that you should be suspicious about. This week it's a
[00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:43.520]   practical piece and a practical set. Holy cow. That's the Mac Observer not T-Mobile.
[00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:51.440]   But that must happen. There must be breaches. Yes. Breaches. The breaches of the day or the
[00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:55.200]   breeches of the day. It's up to you. The nice thing is... The breaches of the day is a different
[00:04:55.200 --> 00:05:00.640]   podcast. That's a different show entirely. It is. And even though Westworld is in between seasons
[00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:06.160]   if you want to go back and figure out what the hell happened last season, Westworld Rewind is
[00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:13.040]   also a great show. Hi Kelly. Welcome back to the microphones. It's going to be fun actually because
[00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:20.560]   you know Lori Gillis as everybody knows but if you didn't know had kind of two big transitions
[00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:24.160]   she got married but even more importantly she's starting working for Apple.
[00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:29.920]   Maybe it should be the other way around. But anyway so because she's working for Apple she's not
[00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:33.840]   on the show anymore which means we have an MTC which I'm going to take advantage of and we're
[00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:39.440]   going to rotate some of our favorite people into that seat. So it's really nice to see you Kelly.
[00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:45.280]   We miss you. That's why it's such great. It's great to have Kelly Gamonton again because it's like
[00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:51.680]   I miss her. Whenever I would guest host it would be like okay there are three people that I would
[00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:57.600]   like to invite. Two of them are Beyonce and Meryl Streep. Definitely knows from them.
[00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:02.160]   Third would be guests. Yeah we're still working on Beyonce. I think that I'm not going to give up.
[00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:08.480]   It's a no-until-a-till. She's got a new song put an Apple watch on it and it might you know that
[00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:12.720]   might actually be the trigger for her to appear. As soon as she launches an app we're in because
[00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:16.320]   her publicity they'll have no idea how to navigate the app community. That's true. I don't think that
[00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:23.120]   we're a big time outlet. No clue. Yeah. That's what we need. Somebody who has no clue so they think
[00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:31.440]   we're a big time outlet. I want to thank both of you for the soft sell. Big changes at Apple.
[00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:38.160]   Excuse me Renee. Sorry. Did you want to say something? We got so excited. We didn't give
[00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:45.840]   a formal introduction. I said hello Renee. We gave him a very quick introduction because I was
[00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:51.600]   so anxious to Jeff DeKelli. Yes. No I did introduce Renee but it was so quick you missed it.
[00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:58.560]   We had a fun start to this episode. I'm just buckling in. Buckle. In. I almost said buckle.
[00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:03.040]   Something else. I don't need to reach you. Me too. Yeah. Don't. So let's talk about reach you.
[00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:08.720]   Because really that's the news. That's this one story and that is now who Renee Filmian.
[00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:16.720]   Who is Dan Riccio? Why is he important? Okay. So once upon a time Big Bob Mansfield ran
[00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:21.520]   hardware at Apple and he began running mostly hardware engineering but then also got a group
[00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:26.400]   called the Hardware Technologies Group that did antennas and chipsets. He decided to retire to
[00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:33.440]   spend more time with his family and all of their money. So he gave his organization to Dan Riccio
[00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:39.200]   who had been vice president of iPad engineering. So Dan became the new vice president of hardware
[00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:45.840]   engineering but along came Johnny Saruji who took on platform technologies and built that into the
[00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:52.160]   Silicon powerhouse that it is today. Like all of Apple Senior Vice Presidents they have way too much
[00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:58.320]   on their plates. So Dan was running hardware and every special project at Apple has to have
[00:07:58.320 --> 00:08:04.160]   a senior vice president who leads it like Jeff Williams leads the Apple Watch. So Dan was leading
[00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:11.360]   Titan and it was a lot. So Bob Mansfield came back to lead that and Dan was spending most of his time
[00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:19.520]   on the iPhone but also the iPad the Mac of course but the VR projects and it sounds like explaining
[00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:27.120]   now too. Game of Thrones season. Can I say this is more like Korean soap opera on Netflix?
[00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:34.320]   Holy cow. This is good stuff. So Riccio who was senior vice president of hardware engineering
[00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:39.200]   but not for long like for a cup of coffee right. I mean Bob Mansfield only recently.
[00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:44.720]   Oh for a very long time. Because Bob came back to take just the Titan part. Oh okay.
[00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:47.920]   Dan was still doing iPhone. That's all the only reason Bob came back if I'm
[00:08:47.920 --> 00:08:53.040]   yeah Bob had retired or was moving in that direction. Yeah he was building that castle.
[00:08:53.040 --> 00:09:00.080]   Yeah let's go to California. So Mansfield running Titan the car project but he's left right.
[00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:03.680]   Is that right? He's left again and they've given it to John G and Andrea this time.
[00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:07.920]   G and Andrea has it of course the guy who came over from Google the AI experts.
[00:09:07.920 --> 00:09:12.800]   Very it actually makes sense that's a pretty prestigious person. Sounds like Titan's a pretty
[00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:17.680]   important project. Riccio who was senior vice president of hardware engineering
[00:09:17.680 --> 00:09:26.640]   begins a new chapter but Apple was pretty cagey. They didn't say in what book. So we don't know.
[00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:32.400]   He's 57. He's probably too young to be retiring at this point. And there's been a lot of speculation.
[00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:39.680]   I think I'm going to go with John Gruber because well he's John Gruber and he probably has some
[00:09:39.680 --> 00:09:45.120]   good sources. He says I still don't know what project Riccio's heading. My guess is
[00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:49.760]   it's not the car project. Who's heading Titan now?
[00:09:49.760 --> 00:09:52.800]   Jim Dreya. Yeah you don't take the Andrea off of that.
[00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:58.240]   No he just got it like last month. Yeah definitely. So I think that's a more than a guess. That's
[00:09:58.240 --> 00:10:08.080]   pretty seriously reasonable. He's saying the headset the AR VR thing that Apple's been kind of
[00:10:08.080 --> 00:10:13.360]   and already runs. So it's super convenient. You know not not what is it that's super easy not
[00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:16.880]   barely any convenience for him to keep running. Well that is a dedicated project. But is that a
[00:10:16.880 --> 00:10:20.320]   step down if you're in charge of all hardware engineering and now you're just doing one thing?
[00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:27.520]   He was getting help from the current. What does he want to be doing? I mean there's that too right
[00:10:27.520 --> 00:10:32.480]   like maybe this project is finally at a point where that's where all his bandwidth needs to be
[00:10:32.480 --> 00:10:39.760]   going anyway. Riccio's been in Apple since 98 22 years. He was on the product design team which of
[00:10:39.760 --> 00:10:47.120]   course at Apple is a very important kind of critical part of the enterprise. He became vice
[00:10:47.120 --> 00:10:54.560]   president of iPad hardware engineering in 2010. In 2012 he became joined the executive team. So
[00:10:54.560 --> 00:10:59.200]   he's been doing this for eight years almost nine years leading hardware engineering.
[00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:04.000]   He did what almost nobody else in the world has been able to do and that is ship iPhones every
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:09.120]   year each year year after year which is probably the hardest job in consumer electronics right now.
[00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:18.880]   So tell us about his replacement John Turnus. John Turnus who is not the guy who used to play
[00:11:18.880 --> 00:11:23.120]   Maryland's husband on Grey's Anatomy. I just want to make that. Thank you. He looks exactly like him.
[00:11:23.120 --> 00:11:28.560]   Not McDreamy. Okay. He started off in Dan Riccio's org and he's been the one who sort of like Dan
[00:11:28.560 --> 00:11:32.880]   Riccio's lieutenant who's been taking more and more of the things off Dan's plate as Dan is focused
[00:11:32.880 --> 00:11:38.640]   more on on iPhone and more on special projects like the AR and VR headset. He debuted the new
[00:11:38.640 --> 00:11:44.320]   redesigned iPad Pro in 2018. The redesigned Mac Pro. Oh that's pretty good 2019. Oh okay.
[00:11:44.320 --> 00:11:48.640]   The pro workflows team which I love that's all the Pixar and ILM and production engineers
[00:11:48.640 --> 00:11:54.080]   reported to him. So they hit pro problems and pro annoyances before we have to anymore.
[00:11:54.080 --> 00:11:56.960]   And now he's been working on the iPhone I think most recently as well.
[00:11:56.960 --> 00:12:01.280]   So it sounds like a good person to take over hardware engineering. Guess where he came from?
[00:12:01.280 --> 00:12:03.520]   Apple's product design team. Yeah.
[00:12:03.520 --> 00:12:10.560]   He sends a patty. Yeah. They're just sort of 20 years which is it. The things that were
[00:12:10.560 --> 00:12:15.280]   mostly on my mind about this is that if Apple has the only real management problem that Apple
[00:12:15.280 --> 00:12:20.960]   seems to have is that people just they decide to end their careers at Apple which means that
[00:12:20.960 --> 00:12:25.600]   if you've been there for 10 or 15 years and you're thinking that oh well geez well maybe if I stick
[00:12:25.600 --> 00:12:30.000]   it out for another five one day I will be like one of the holy 10 or whatever. The thing is the
[00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:34.960]   people whoever it is job that you want they're not leaving. So one of the part one of the factors
[00:12:34.960 --> 00:12:41.440]   of this I was wondering if it was partly so we can basically move up John and give him some more
[00:12:41.440 --> 00:12:48.640]   some more runway while also really giving some boost to a project that maybe needs a bit of a
[00:12:48.640 --> 00:12:54.400]   some fairy dust in order to make it move forward. It's it's a way to keep on board somebody who's
[00:12:54.400 --> 00:12:58.720]   been incredibly valuable also move up someone into a position that will probably be with Apple for
[00:12:58.720 --> 00:13:03.360]   the next 10 years and again finish out his career at Apple as well. There are a lot of rumors that
[00:13:03.360 --> 00:13:09.280]   I was reading about as people were speculating that oh well he must be they must be moving them
[00:13:09.280 --> 00:13:14.080]   up because oh now he's responsible directly to the CEO with no specific responsibilities.
[00:13:14.080 --> 00:13:18.080]   Oh okay they must be pushing him out but that's what's true on other companies that happen at
[00:13:18.080 --> 00:13:24.000]   Google a couple of times. Apple is its own special entity and none of this usual rules of management
[00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:28.560]   apply so I have no doubt that what's being the basic rumors or excuse me the basic statement being
[00:13:28.560 --> 00:13:33.920]   made by Apple is absolutely true and although it's a it's an easy guess that it's going to be
[00:13:33.920 --> 00:13:39.920]   VR and wearables as a huge category. It also I have to say that my first thought was oh what
[00:13:39.920 --> 00:13:45.920]   what has not been leaked to the press yet or what has nobody guessed yet and it's like what was
[00:13:45.920 --> 00:13:51.440]   exactly. That was me too was new and excited like working on something new and exciting I think
[00:13:51.440 --> 00:13:58.560]   was what he said and or like in the official statement anyway and like the way it was phrased sort of
[00:13:58.560 --> 00:14:03.920]   made me made me wonder too so when we talked about it this morning on daily observations that was
[00:14:03.920 --> 00:14:08.800]   my thought was like how is this going to change the rumors that we get and like the landscape of
[00:14:08.800 --> 00:14:14.960]   what people are mumbling about that Apple's sure to be up to next and it's going to be whatever he's
[00:14:14.960 --> 00:14:18.880]   in charge of now. Is it the consensus at the Mac of server that that's what he's going to be doing
[00:14:18.880 --> 00:14:24.960]   is is the glasses. It is not. Charlotte still thinks it might be the car. Brian
[00:14:24.960 --> 00:14:33.440]   enthusiastically disagreed with her this morning. You're crazy. Well especially as John O'Graya is
[00:14:33.440 --> 00:14:38.800]   so prestigious and so recently anointed. Yes. It seems odd that they would replace him at this
[00:14:38.800 --> 00:14:43.520]   point. Yeah like he hasn't even like warmed up the seat yet so it seems really unlikely but
[00:14:43.520 --> 00:14:48.480]   yeah my. By the way here is a new rumor that the Apple car will have seat warmers. I just heard
[00:14:48.480 --> 00:14:53.760]   that. That's how these rumors start. Why John sits in every car to warm them up for you. Oh I know
[00:14:53.760 --> 00:14:57.840]   see this is why I know I could never be trust like I will never get a job at Apple because I would be
[00:14:57.840 --> 00:15:03.680]   the person that goes and puts like a nine inch iPhone in the iTunes string so that somebody goes
[00:15:03.680 --> 00:15:10.560]   and loses their mind about it or you know Mac OS 12 and all all the laptops are 12 inches now you
[00:15:10.560 --> 00:15:15.040]   know like you're very that nine layers deep in programming so somebody digs it up and loses
[00:15:15.040 --> 00:15:19.440]   their mind like that's what I would do. Me too. And that's why I'll never get to knowing knowing
[00:15:19.440 --> 00:15:24.160]   that people are parsing the source code. You kind of said this is what's for Steve Trotter. Mark Mark
[00:15:24.160 --> 00:15:29.520]   Mark Girmen is going to be like me. But I but I took a look at Kelly Gomont's Spotify and it turns
[00:15:29.520 --> 00:15:34.160]   out most of her most of the things she's been adding to her library are things that would sound great
[00:15:34.160 --> 00:15:41.360]   inside a compact car but not as you be. Okay. You can read a lot from like the tone of the press
[00:15:41.360 --> 00:15:46.240]   releases too though because when you look at how the Scott Forestall and John Browett press release
[00:15:46.240 --> 00:15:51.760]   was compared to like the Angela Aaron's press release compared to the Phil Schiller and Dan
[00:15:51.760 --> 00:15:57.520]   Riccio press releases. This sounds much more like you have someone as talented as Jaws or as John
[00:15:57.520 --> 00:16:02.080]   Turner's and you want to give them room to grow but you don't want to lose a super talented veterans
[00:16:02.080 --> 00:16:06.560]   in Dan Riccio or Phil Schiller. So Phil Schiller gets App Store and he gets a couple other things
[00:16:06.560 --> 00:16:11.520]   and events and Dan Riccio gets AR VR or whatever that is and you keep all these talented people
[00:16:11.520 --> 00:16:16.880]   super happy while removing some of the enormous buffet style portions on their plates at the same
[00:16:16.880 --> 00:16:23.120]   time. Phil Schiller is like at large now. Is he like sort of means he doesn't do anything?
[00:16:23.120 --> 00:16:27.920]   Apple fella. He does eventually does. Precisely what he wants to and nothing else. He has lunch
[00:16:27.920 --> 00:16:33.760]   on the roof every day. Yeah. And those events were good though. I mean looking back he did a
[00:16:33.760 --> 00:16:38.640]   really good job on those end of year events. Oh yeah. They were fantastic. I honestly think
[00:16:38.640 --> 00:16:42.240]   we were really impressed with them like watching them was great. They were super efficient because
[00:16:42.240 --> 00:16:46.960]   we didn't have to wait for everyone in the theater to a plug. So everybody got in and out like before
[00:16:46.960 --> 00:16:51.360]   your watch told you to stand up. Yeah. I think it's going to it's the future of Apple events. I
[00:16:51.360 --> 00:16:57.920]   hope it is the future of Apple events. Me too. I have to say though this is a problem particularly
[00:16:57.920 --> 00:17:03.440]   unique to Apple as you kind of intimated. All these guys don't need the money at this point.
[00:17:03.440 --> 00:17:07.680]   Nobody does. Apple stock. In fact Apple stock. We'll talk about this in a second because there
[00:17:07.680 --> 00:17:12.000]   Wednesday we're going to get their fourth quarter earnings and already in advance of that.
[00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:16.880]   You know you buy on the rumor cell on the news. Apple stock is the highest was the highest on
[00:17:16.880 --> 00:17:20.800]   Friday. It's ever been. They didn't pay so great to begin with Leo. Like I mean a lot of people
[00:17:20.800 --> 00:17:24.720]   who go to Apple they don't go there for the money because Facebook and startups are more
[00:17:24.720 --> 00:17:28.960]   than eager to outbid Apple. You go there because you you believe you drink the kool-aid. You want
[00:17:28.960 --> 00:17:32.720]   to change the world. Yeah you want to dent the universe. Yeah that's how they got that's how Steve
[00:17:32.720 --> 00:17:37.280]   Jobs famously got John Scully to join the USL sugar water for the rest of your life or change the world.
[00:17:37.280 --> 00:17:41.200]   Do you want to quickly quickly quickly? And cook and fill the world out better. Yeah. Yeah.
[00:17:41.200 --> 00:17:46.000]   Just just just quickly think about all the senior executives in the automotive industry that
[00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:52.080]   they talked into leaving huge careers to become part of a fandom project. So but money does have
[00:17:52.080 --> 00:17:58.400]   something to do with it. I mean to be a vice president. Yeah that's right. You went from a CEO job to
[00:17:58.400 --> 00:18:06.160]   VP. But yeah but money has to you have to you don't it's not the primary rationale but nobody is
[00:18:06.160 --> 00:18:14.800]   going to go to Apple or leave Apple over money. Yeah that's number why. Yeah but they nevertheless
[00:18:14.800 --> 00:18:19.280]   I think they're all in great shape of financial. I would assume they are sure.
[00:18:20.880 --> 00:18:25.600]   That they can do whatever they want. And so that must be an interesting situation where you've got
[00:18:25.600 --> 00:18:32.720]   these executives. You've got a huge amount of institutional knowledge up here in their brains.
[00:18:32.720 --> 00:18:38.080]   You don't want to lose them. You want but you want to keep them challenged and they have no
[00:18:38.080 --> 00:18:43.920]   financial handcuffs. So that's what I see in this press release. We needed to keep Riccio
[00:18:43.920 --> 00:18:49.280]   engaged. So we gave him something interesting. Yeah. Like Johnny did with Apple Park and
[00:18:49.280 --> 00:18:53.920]   and Apple retail and they gave him a car with umbrella ejector is to drive him back and forth
[00:18:53.920 --> 00:18:59.840]   every day. I can see the news John. I could see Riccio going into Tim Cook's office sitting down
[00:18:59.840 --> 00:19:07.760]   to Tim. I got to talk to you and saying I'm bored. Look I'm 57. I figure I'm going to retire in
[00:19:07.760 --> 00:19:14.720]   about eight years. I have one big project left in me. I would like to do X right. You think he
[00:19:14.720 --> 00:19:19.840]   probably said I would like to do this. Give me this. Which happens because they have people who
[00:19:19.840 --> 00:19:24.080]   even left Apple like after the iPhone. The iPhone was come here and build the future. And then after
[00:19:24.080 --> 00:19:28.080]   that you have a bunch of people whose only desire is to build the future. They don't want to maintain
[00:19:28.080 --> 00:19:31.920]   anything. They don't want to go back and work on the Mac. That was the previous future. They want
[00:19:31.920 --> 00:19:35.760]   the next new thing. And they got back a ton of people for Titan. They're getting back a ton of
[00:19:35.760 --> 00:19:40.480]   people for the AR VR thing that just want to work on whatever the next big thing is. So it helps
[00:19:40.480 --> 00:19:44.560]   the stock prices through the roof. But it doesn't. That's not the motivation. And I have to say if
[00:19:44.560 --> 00:19:49.840]   I'm Tim Cook sitting across the desk, if he has a desk from this face, I'm going yeah, whatever you
[00:19:49.840 --> 00:19:56.720]   want. Whatever you want. I give you anything. Don't hit me. He's scary looking. Can I mention
[00:19:56.720 --> 00:20:03.440]   another thing that at some remember that Steve Jobs picked him cook because he knew that at some
[00:20:03.440 --> 00:20:08.640]   point he was not going to be CEO of Apple anymore through natural causes or unnatural causes.
[00:20:08.640 --> 00:20:13.040]   At some point, Tim Cook knows that he's going to have to name some or excuse me,
[00:20:13.040 --> 00:20:18.160]   somebody is going to have to be CEO. So they have to have a lot of people in those lanes that are
[00:20:18.160 --> 00:20:22.800]   being groomed towards a position where they could one day take over the entire company. So this is
[00:20:22.800 --> 00:20:27.200]   this is another factor when it comes to we don't just want to hold on to this person because they
[00:20:27.200 --> 00:20:31.120]   are smart and they're valuable and because their knowledge would be too valuable to an enemy.
[00:20:31.120 --> 00:20:35.840]   A lot of it is that we need to have two or three people who not only have just not only are just
[00:20:35.840 --> 00:20:41.040]   good business people, not only are good engineers and designers, but people who grew up inside the
[00:20:41.040 --> 00:20:47.920]   unique culture of Apple. And so it's not just we want to make sure we maintain the stock price.
[00:20:47.920 --> 00:20:54.000]   We want to make sure we maintain our company's dominance. There is a culture and there is a
[00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:58.160]   character at Apple that has to be maintained more importantly than anything else. So we have to
[00:20:58.160 --> 00:21:02.400]   find these people. We have to take these people who have these 20 years worth of experience that
[00:21:02.400 --> 00:21:06.800]   are part of the culture that have been born and brave and those what say born and braised,
[00:21:06.800 --> 00:21:11.280]   there's probably something similar to that with corporate fighting. But that's also part of a
[00:21:11.280 --> 00:21:18.240]   journey in Apple culture for many years. We've been basted and intel for way too long. Now it's
[00:21:18.240 --> 00:21:23.120]   time to we're about to draw out here. We got to pull this out of the oven. This is going to end up
[00:21:23.120 --> 00:21:29.280]   being another one of those moves that like is very standard for Apple, right? Like we're going to
[00:21:29.280 --> 00:21:33.120]   get a few years down the road and we're going to look back and go, that thing that didn't make
[00:21:33.120 --> 00:21:38.880]   sense when they did it and we all kind of sat around with it. Like that makes total sense now
[00:21:38.880 --> 00:21:46.240]   that we know what we know in 2025 or whatever. Like just like when we get weird features or
[00:21:46.240 --> 00:21:51.200]   removal of features or new functionality in an operating system and then like two operating
[00:21:51.200 --> 00:21:55.840]   systems down the road. Oh, that thing they did two times ago makes perfect sense now.
[00:21:55.840 --> 00:22:01.920]   So this is the same sort of thing just with Apple leadership and not with user interface.
[00:22:01.920 --> 00:22:10.640]   So all right. Now we move on to if it is glasses, what do we know about Apple's glasses?
[00:22:10.640 --> 00:22:16.800]   Their ambition, we've heard rumors in the past that they might have a VR headset this year
[00:22:16.800 --> 00:22:22.400]   but the true AR glasses next year. Kelly, what do you think? What's going on?
[00:22:24.080 --> 00:22:28.560]   Well, I don't know any, I'm not convinced about the timeline from anybody, first of all.
[00:22:28.560 --> 00:22:35.760]   I think the glasses are going to be really complicated because we've seen two iterations
[00:22:35.760 --> 00:22:42.880]   of glasses from other companies fail for loads of reasons, whether it was expense or reliability
[00:22:42.880 --> 00:22:48.800]   or they were just sort of awkward to use or it made people feel weird about like I know that
[00:22:48.800 --> 00:22:53.040]   your glasses are looking at me separately from your eyeballs looking at me.
[00:22:53.040 --> 00:22:59.360]   Where Google Glass into a barn get beat up. Yeah. So I think until they can get over
[00:22:59.360 --> 00:23:04.880]   that was that you know that piece of it. I don't know what it is that Apple's going to bring to
[00:23:04.880 --> 00:23:09.600]   this that's going to make it any more appealing to the same people who went well, you know,
[00:23:09.600 --> 00:23:15.840]   like the Snapchat glasses are very weird looking and they're all bright yellow and like nobody
[00:23:15.840 --> 00:23:21.760]   wants to, nobody wants to wear them and the Google Glass ones were like super obvious,
[00:23:21.760 --> 00:23:26.240]   you know, looking like Google Glass and not just sort of regular glasses from people
[00:23:26.240 --> 00:23:30.800]   and how they're going to get around that like I don't want your glasses recording me,
[00:23:30.800 --> 00:23:36.080]   you know, if I don't know about it already or whatever. I have no idea what you're talking about.
[00:23:36.080 --> 00:23:42.080]   I think these look awesome. These look completely normal. Is that Leon Redbone that's taking over
[00:23:42.080 --> 00:23:48.880]   the host of the show? I agree with you. Let me get my banjo. My ukuleles in the other room.
[00:23:48.880 --> 00:23:54.640]   So but that's Kelly. Isn't that exactly what Apple so good at is taking a product? Think about the
[00:23:54.640 --> 00:24:01.280]   iPod. It was pre it was preceded by a lot of kind of not so it was no no matters. Yeah, right.
[00:24:01.280 --> 00:24:09.600]   The diamond Rio, the Sansa, there was that car head unit that was like had a hard drive in it.
[00:24:09.600 --> 00:24:14.720]   That's exactly what the product category Apple likes to be in, right?
[00:24:15.840 --> 00:24:20.880]   Are those like I'm not sure how they're going to I'm not sure how they're going to crack it is
[00:24:20.880 --> 00:24:26.080]   the thing like I have no doubt that they could if anybody could it's going to be Apple. It wasn't
[00:24:26.080 --> 00:24:31.760]   Snapchat. I don't think it was Google. So definitely wasn't Google. Yeah. Good. How about Oculus? How
[00:24:31.760 --> 00:24:38.000]   about Facebook with the Oculus? Well, I mean, you can't really wear that to a bar. Can you? No,
[00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:43.360]   that's but that's what the rumor is. By the way, did you call these my snapicles? Yeah,
[00:24:43.360 --> 00:24:47.840]   okay, the snap of a spectacle, right? Yeah, but I think I never heard of the
[00:24:47.840 --> 00:24:53.680]   snapicles, but I think that might actually be a good thing. This is not the this is the first
[00:24:53.680 --> 00:24:58.080]   generation. This is not the current generation. Are you snapping us right? Did you snap and you
[00:24:58.080 --> 00:25:02.640]   snap and you think us right now right now? I'm snapping you. Yeah. So these are the opposite of
[00:25:02.640 --> 00:25:07.440]   I think what Apple is the rumors are Apple would do. These are all about cameras and the rumor is
[00:25:07.440 --> 00:25:13.600]   Apple's won't have a camera at all. Right? Kelly, isn't that right? That's that's what I've seen. And
[00:25:13.600 --> 00:25:20.880]   like that may that takes the whole awkwardness of wearing them like away from the people around
[00:25:20.880 --> 00:25:26.640]   you. Like remember having people around you? Right now, I don't need I don't need
[00:25:26.640 --> 00:25:31.280]   augmented reality glasses. I know where my sofa is in my living room. I don't
[00:25:32.080 --> 00:25:37.760]   right. And like I think if there's no camera, I think that helps solve a lot of the problem
[00:25:37.760 --> 00:25:41.600]   that people who didn't wear them had with people who did. That's right. I agree.
[00:25:41.600 --> 00:25:46.720]   So it also takes away a lot of it also takes away a lot of functionality, right?
[00:25:46.720 --> 00:25:53.840]   Maybe but maybe not like I don't know maybe part of the the LiDAR stuff is like LiDAR is
[00:25:53.840 --> 00:26:01.760]   partly echolocation. I think like it's not all using the camera lens to do things. It's like
[00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:06.720]   laser and echolocation stuff. And so if it's doing that, like there's no need for a camera.
[00:26:06.720 --> 00:26:13.120]   You could make a 3D image of the world around you. Yeah, Apple tags will tell them who we are, Leo.
[00:26:13.120 --> 00:26:17.040]   They don't need to see us. It'll just say, it'll be like Daredevil radar sense and then it'll
[00:26:17.040 --> 00:26:21.600]   detect a person there and her Apple tags will say Kelly, I'll be fine. So I could upload a 3D image
[00:26:21.600 --> 00:26:27.840]   of Kelly to my Instagram, but not a picture. No, you can't do it. I don't think any I think
[00:26:27.840 --> 00:26:32.640]   there's going to be like data store, like data, you know, security around any of that. So you
[00:26:32.640 --> 00:26:38.960]   couldn't. But I think it's going to be interesting to see like if there's no camera, how they're
[00:26:38.960 --> 00:26:43.360]   going to get around some of that functionality. And it's also possible. Like we've seen a lot of
[00:26:43.360 --> 00:26:50.080]   advances from Apple with regards to accessibility and what things look like and recognizing that
[00:26:50.080 --> 00:26:56.160]   there are people in the world who aren't, you know, within what are like the standard usage
[00:26:56.160 --> 00:27:01.360]   guidelines for Apple software and Apple hardware. And so maybe this is just going to be a huge push
[00:27:01.360 --> 00:27:07.200]   for people who need visual assistance could wear these and be able to get around a lot more easily.
[00:27:07.200 --> 00:27:11.840]   And it might be something along those lines, like we know that they're going huge into health
[00:27:11.840 --> 00:27:18.400]   and well-being and, you know, tracking, you know, tracking different statistics, like, you know,
[00:27:18.400 --> 00:27:23.680]   heart rate and how well did you sleep and stuff like that. And so this could just be another piece
[00:27:23.680 --> 00:27:29.120]   like slightly with a health angle that maybe, you know, compliments the watch in some way.
[00:27:29.120 --> 00:27:36.080]   Andy, do you think augmented VR? What do you think? Do you go along with the time, the proposed
[00:27:36.080 --> 00:27:40.400]   timeline by the rumor mill that it'll be VR this year, AR next year? Does that make sense?
[00:27:40.400 --> 00:27:44.960]   I don't know about the actual timeline of when we can expect these things, but I definitely
[00:27:44.960 --> 00:27:50.080]   agree with the idea of if Apple is really serious about this, the only thing they could do right now
[00:27:50.080 --> 00:27:55.920]   is virtual reality. And they're very, very well posed to do virtual reality in a way that would
[00:27:55.920 --> 00:28:02.640]   make people want to buy a VR headset in the same way that they would want to buy a $500 or $600
[00:28:02.640 --> 00:28:08.640]   game console, or more like as likely the way that a company would want to buy these things in the
[00:28:08.640 --> 00:28:14.480]   hundreds for training. The problem with augmented reality is that I'm not aware right now of any
[00:28:14.480 --> 00:28:19.600]   display technology that could give us augmented reality the way that we keep imagining it to be,
[00:28:19.600 --> 00:28:25.920]   where I'm wearing these glasses. They are somewhere on the spectrum from Andy and not go to all the
[00:28:25.920 --> 00:28:30.800]   way up to Roy Orbison, meaning they're wearable. They don't distract from what people react to me.
[00:28:30.800 --> 00:28:35.200]   And they will still be able to they will give me the thing where if I'm walking around, it is
[00:28:35.200 --> 00:28:39.040]   adding things to my field of view and enhancing and annotating things. I'm not aware of any
[00:28:39.040 --> 00:28:43.120]   display technology that would work that way unless you wind up with a magic leap sort of
[00:28:43.120 --> 00:28:49.520]   situation where you have thick goggles and some sort of tether to a pod that's on your belt.
[00:28:50.160 --> 00:28:56.240]   So I do like the idea of Apple starting off by taking a lot of the functionality that they've
[00:28:56.240 --> 00:29:01.600]   been putting into the iPhone, particularly with its APIs and also with its artificial
[00:29:01.600 --> 00:29:05.680]   intelligence research and putting that into something where they don't really have to worry
[00:29:05.680 --> 00:29:11.120]   about, well, what if it is too heavy to wear for eight hours a day? Well, can we do it for two hours?
[00:29:11.120 --> 00:29:16.400]   That's fine. What if the battery can't last more than an hour and a half? Well, that's fine too.
[00:29:16.400 --> 00:29:21.840]   What if it does make you look like a low bot plus Georgie Leforj? We can do that too.
[00:29:21.840 --> 00:29:27.360]   Those are things that are attainable. When you talk about self-driving car, at least
[00:29:27.360 --> 00:29:32.160]   the basic technology is there. We can make it work. It's not going to work perfectly at this point
[00:29:32.160 --> 00:29:38.080]   with augmented reality. Again, within the context of a wearable thing that people will want to wear,
[00:29:38.080 --> 00:29:42.240]   I don't know of a display technology right now that can make that happen. Again, maybe I'm
[00:29:42.240 --> 00:29:46.080]   uninformed. Maybe Apple has patents that they've things that they don't even dare patent at this
[00:29:46.080 --> 00:29:52.000]   point, but that's how I feel about it. I agree with what Kelly said earlier,
[00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:57.360]   but I don't think that they would be doing it this year or maybe next year, but I'd be
[00:29:57.360 --> 00:30:04.800]   interested in the year after that. There's a certain amount of people trust that Apple has some magic
[00:30:04.800 --> 00:30:09.360]   under the hood that we don't know about. That's just kind of the... It's just patients presumed,
[00:30:09.360 --> 00:30:13.200]   but it's not necessarily the case. Let me read to you what Mark Gurman said on Thursday
[00:30:14.480 --> 00:30:20.720]   in Bloomberg. Apple's first crack at a headset is designed to be a pricey, niche precursor to a
[00:30:20.720 --> 00:30:26.640]   more ambitious augmented reality product that will take longer to develop. According to people
[00:30:26.640 --> 00:30:32.480]   with knowledge of the matter, Mark usually has pretty good inside sources. He knows people.
[00:30:32.480 --> 00:30:37.200]   He knows people. The initial device has confronted several development hurdles.
[00:30:37.200 --> 00:30:44.240]   The company has conservative sales expectations. He says it's mostly virtual reality. He says
[00:30:44.240 --> 00:30:53.600]   2022, not this year, but next year, but it will display an all-encompassing 3D digital environment
[00:30:53.600 --> 00:30:58.640]   for gaming, watching video, and communicating. I think this is going to be a... That's a tough
[00:30:58.640 --> 00:31:04.960]   nut to crack because Facebook's really there already, especially with the Oculus Quest 2.
[00:31:04.960 --> 00:31:08.400]   Yeah, but you know what you get with Oculus? You get Facebook.
[00:31:08.400 --> 00:31:13.840]   Yeah, and I think that was a strategic blunder by Facebook that has kept me from buying a Quest.
[00:31:14.160 --> 00:31:14.960]   That's why I don't have one.
[00:31:14.960 --> 00:31:20.640]   Yeah, that is really a self-inflicted wound. I don't really get what Facebook's
[00:31:20.640 --> 00:31:22.960]   sticking with. I had the Quest 1. I was already the buyer of the Quest 2.
[00:31:22.960 --> 00:31:28.080]   Every time they say we swear we're never going to conflate Facebook IDs with the company we just
[00:31:28.080 --> 00:31:32.800]   bought. Every time they do it, I can only blame myself at this point and vote with my wallet.
[00:31:32.800 --> 00:31:36.560]   I said, "No." I think they're starting to realize it because there seems to be a mass
[00:31:36.560 --> 00:31:41.920]   exodus from WhatsApp for that very reason. They reacted fast. They always say we never react
[00:31:41.920 --> 00:31:44.880]   quickly. We always wait. They reacted so fast to WhatsApp.
[00:31:44.880 --> 00:31:50.160]   Yeah, they put off that privacy change that would merge WhatsApp's information with Facebook.
[00:31:50.160 --> 00:31:53.600]   Because we misunderstood. We were confused about what they were saying.
[00:31:53.600 --> 00:31:57.120]   You didn't know what we were doing. You didn't understand.
[00:31:57.120 --> 00:32:01.520]   We're going to wait until April to confirm that. What they'll do is wait until the news cycle moves
[00:32:01.520 --> 00:32:06.000]   on and then they're going, "Oh, yes." But it's interesting because Facebook has... Oh,
[00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:10.320]   there's been a lot of the league Facebook movements, several of which I've participated in.
[00:32:10.960 --> 00:32:18.640]   But that's never wounded Facebook in any appreciable way. I have to think maybe 20 million people
[00:32:18.640 --> 00:32:22.960]   leaving WhatsApp is not insignificant. I think that's the ballpark figure.
[00:32:22.960 --> 00:32:32.400]   Telegram says thank you. Yeah. So signal we have heard had something like 10 million new
[00:32:32.400 --> 00:32:37.600]   subscribers, but they're hoping to get to 100 million. They're much farther along than they were
[00:32:37.600 --> 00:32:43.280]   because of WhatsApp. We don't know how many new users Telegram has, but I would guess it's
[00:32:43.280 --> 00:32:46.480]   quite a few. I'm starting to hear from non-tech people
[00:32:46.480 --> 00:32:50.240]   because I've been on Telegram for years saying, "I'm going to use Telegram."
[00:32:50.240 --> 00:32:55.200]   It's a stupefying number of new users, like ridiculous beyond any expectation number.
[00:32:55.200 --> 00:32:59.680]   It's never a tag. Well, and so that's not happened before to Facebook.
[00:32:59.680 --> 00:33:06.000]   So that's got to sting a little bit. So in any event, to get back to this AR thing,
[00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:11.200]   I mean, obviously Apple's going to require an Apple account with their VR, but that's not
[00:33:11.200 --> 00:33:15.600]   as punishing as a Facebook account. The interesting part of this though is that it ties into the
[00:33:15.600 --> 00:33:20.400]   rumors of the new Apple TV that they've been holding back on for a little while now.
[00:33:20.400 --> 00:33:26.240]   That's where there was a conservative model that was just an A12x processor, but a more ambitious
[00:33:26.240 --> 00:33:30.880]   model that was going to be higher end gaming and that Apple might even start investing in studios
[00:33:30.880 --> 00:33:35.840]   beyond Apple Arcade to make it really a first-rate gaming experience. Are you saying the TV?
[00:33:35.840 --> 00:33:41.600]   It's a base unit for the head service. The service would be cross-device and the
[00:33:41.600 --> 00:33:46.400]   the helmet would be like the premier way of experiencing it. And you could also play on your
[00:33:46.400 --> 00:33:50.080]   TV and your iPhone and your iPad, of course. Pretty much guarantee Apple will not call it a hell.
[00:33:50.080 --> 00:33:56.400]   They'll somehow make a deal with Disney and they'll call it the "lowbot" because it'll go around
[00:33:56.400 --> 00:34:01.040]   the back ear head with all the batteries and stuff. The original Apple TV was called the "lowbot."
[00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:06.240]   Oh, really? I didn't do that. Oh, that's because it was a lobotomized Mac.
[00:34:06.240 --> 00:34:12.160]   That's why I went there. Really? Well, see, you guys are way ahead of me. You got that inside there.
[00:34:12.160 --> 00:34:15.040]   Are you twins? Are you doing twin talk now? We travel a little.
[00:34:15.040 --> 00:34:20.960]   That was just a bonus. It's also a bonus Star Wars reference. Hi. So, the other piece of it,
[00:34:20.960 --> 00:34:27.520]   though, I think is that we keep talking about the Apple TV. Someday we're going to get a new one.
[00:34:28.960 --> 00:34:34.880]   Someday, Apple keeps trying to be a little bit, at least partly a gaming company,
[00:34:34.880 --> 00:34:38.560]   and we're not getting enough out of them for the most part to really feel like they're taking
[00:34:38.560 --> 00:34:47.440]   that completely seriously. So, having the gaming part be a serious component and why the Apple TV
[00:34:47.440 --> 00:34:51.600]   hasn't, the new iteration of the Apple TV hasn't been released yet makes a lot of sense.
[00:34:52.320 --> 00:34:59.120]   So, I hope that that's true and that we do get something great in gaming from Apple TV because
[00:34:59.120 --> 00:35:06.640]   I think there are a lot of people like me who don't want to put the money down on a PlayStation
[00:35:06.640 --> 00:35:13.040]   or an Xbox. I'm not hundreds and hundreds of dollars to pay for it, gamer. I'll pay five bucks
[00:35:13.040 --> 00:35:18.720]   a month to Apple Gamer and maybe buy a hundred dollar box and not a five hundred dollar box.
[00:35:18.720 --> 00:35:25.840]   So, when Herman said, Herman said, "German says that this first headset will be more expensive
[00:35:25.840 --> 00:35:30.080]   than those from rivals." And of course, the Quest 2 starts at what, 250, 300?
[00:35:30.080 --> 00:35:36.400]   That'll be the AirPods Max of VR headsets. Yeah. Some Apple insiders, I'm quoting again,
[00:35:36.400 --> 00:35:41.040]   Mark Gurman, "Believe the company may sell only one headset per day per retail store."
[00:35:41.040 --> 00:35:47.440]   So, that's not, that's, that's not for Apple. That's not for Apple. That's one of the things
[00:35:47.440 --> 00:35:50.240]   that got me thinking, "Yeah, I don't know if they would do that."
[00:35:50.240 --> 00:35:54.080]   They just want to get the technology out. It's super expensive. They want to make sure
[00:35:54.080 --> 00:35:59.040]   that that's less than a hobby. That's what are you doing?
[00:35:59.040 --> 00:36:05.280]   You know Cyclops or Fordy Lefour? Oh, I get it. Those are the AirPods Pro Max
[00:36:05.280 --> 00:36:09.440]   and you're looking through the headband. Yeah, I think an Oculus Quest.
[00:36:09.440 --> 00:36:14.480]   Why don't these are just going your ears? Hey, wait a minute. Let's conflate two big rumors.
[00:36:14.480 --> 00:36:18.000]   We talked about it last week, the rumor that you'll be able to replace the headband.
[00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:22.720]   What if you could replace the headband with Jordy Forge glasses? With a visor.
[00:36:22.720 --> 00:36:30.160]   That drops down when necessary. A Ruby visor. Oh, there it is. Now, the clamping force on your
[00:36:30.160 --> 00:36:33.760]   head is going to be kind of intense, but I'm, well, Apple fans will go for that.
[00:36:33.760 --> 00:36:37.520]   You'll keep your head smaller, Andy. I need that. Yeah. Keep your,
[00:36:37.520 --> 00:36:40.640]   giving a swold head from being an Apple user, which is being a possibility.
[00:36:40.640 --> 00:36:43.600]   Your ears are holding it wrong. Yes.
[00:36:43.600 --> 00:36:48.400]   Can you just imagine what this plus having your rings closed in 3D on your visor as you just keep
[00:36:48.400 --> 00:36:53.040]   trucking along? I feel like this is less than the helmet would be terrifying.
[00:36:53.040 --> 00:37:03.920]   One thing that I wanted to bring in though, you think about Apple doing a VR headset and
[00:37:03.920 --> 00:37:10.240]   a headset that creates virtual reality experiences. That's very, very prudent. That's very, very good.
[00:37:10.800 --> 00:37:14.960]   One thing with Apple though is that you wonder if they're going to also,
[00:37:14.960 --> 00:37:19.760]   they're also working on a piece of hardware for generating that kind of VR environment.
[00:37:19.760 --> 00:37:24.880]   Not just software, not just APIs, but what if they are working on a VR camera so that
[00:37:24.880 --> 00:37:31.120]   not, not a 3D iPhone, but iPhone camera, but something that will allow producers and then
[00:37:31.120 --> 00:37:37.120]   consumers to capture augmented reality experiences and deliver them. Even if they were just to simply,
[00:37:37.120 --> 00:37:43.680]   even if they were to start really, really small and say, and when they're create a
[00:37:43.680 --> 00:37:48.480]   road kit that they could bring to events that they could bring to concerts that they could bring to
[00:37:48.480 --> 00:37:52.480]   speeches and things like that and capture that sort of stuff so that they can create a new channel
[00:37:52.480 --> 00:37:58.480]   on Apple VR plus, so to speak. There's a lot that Apple has the fire power to accomplish whatever
[00:37:58.480 --> 00:38:05.760]   they want to do. And this is why we can spend an hour talking non BS-wise about possibilities
[00:38:05.760 --> 00:38:10.240]   of unannounced products. So Andy, the thing that you just gave me an idea,
[00:38:10.240 --> 00:38:21.040]   what if part of the LIDAR 3D mapping of what the goggles or the robot that we are talking about,
[00:38:21.040 --> 00:38:28.640]   the technology that makes that possible in a real space to know not to walk into a wall or
[00:38:28.640 --> 00:38:34.480]   walk down the stairs or whatever. That's the same technology you would need in an automobile.
[00:38:34.480 --> 00:38:40.640]   So if they're making this for the helmet, you could scale that up to an auto and then
[00:38:40.640 --> 00:38:48.720]   it's the same principle of keep you from crashing into stuff, keep you from harm by
[00:38:48.720 --> 00:38:53.280]   walking off the edge of something, walking into a wall, whatever. You would need all of those
[00:38:53.280 --> 00:38:58.640]   same things if you were designing something that required the ability to navigate without
[00:38:58.640 --> 00:39:04.000]   assistance. You would need the same thing. So I wonder if maybe there's some overlap
[00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:06.720]   between our first story and our second story.
[00:39:06.720 --> 00:39:14.640]   >> I certainly think that Apple is, Apple has never been a company of individual divisions
[00:39:14.640 --> 00:39:18.720]   that are sort of like sub companies making their own independent products. They are all building
[00:39:18.720 --> 00:39:25.040]   every person works at Apple and every project. Exactly. So I believe that Apple
[00:39:25.040 --> 00:39:28.400]   believes its research money is best put into creating things that they could put into
[00:39:28.400 --> 00:39:33.840]   as many of products as possible. So maybe I have a hard time imagining a one-to-one mapping of
[00:39:34.240 --> 00:39:38.880]   car technology being used for personal collision avoidance. But nonetheless,
[00:39:38.880 --> 00:39:44.960]   the sort of breakthroughs you need in image processing, the sort of AI models that you would
[00:39:44.960 --> 00:39:49.680]   need to build with a much more complicated rig that you could then compress down and put the model
[00:39:49.680 --> 00:39:53.600]   itself into a more portable thing. And that's absolutely spot on as far as I'm concerned.
[00:39:53.600 --> 00:40:01.440]   >> I am going to guess that what's really happening here and maybe why Dan Ricchio is moving over to
[00:40:01.440 --> 00:40:07.040]   this division if that's where he's going, is that this is a really tough engineering problem.
[00:40:07.040 --> 00:40:15.280]   One of the things German says is the initial versions that included fans and heavy-duty
[00:40:15.280 --> 00:40:19.120]   processors caused neck strain and they were concerned about that.
[00:40:19.120 --> 00:40:22.560]   >> If you have a headset you can't live ahead.
[00:40:22.560 --> 00:40:25.360]   >> There was a lawsuit. Remember there was in the court documents, there was a lawsuit of some
[00:40:25.360 --> 00:40:27.920]   a tester who got injured who did get injured in the neck testing.
[00:40:27.920 --> 00:40:33.120]   So I'm going to guess we know Apple throws a lot of spaghetti against the wall.
[00:40:33.120 --> 00:40:38.640]   Not all of it sticks. A lot of it probably doesn't stick. And I'm going to guess this is not
[00:40:38.640 --> 00:40:43.440]   yet a releaseable product that it may never be released. People calm down.
[00:40:43.440 --> 00:40:46.240]   I think one of the reasons- >> My platform.
[00:40:46.240 --> 00:40:52.720]   >> Yeah. One of the reasons there is a lot of ferment around this is because for a while,
[00:40:52.720 --> 00:40:57.600]   Tim Cook was saying augmented reality a lot. Has he calmed down on that?
[00:40:57.600 --> 00:41:02.720]   >> No, but it's not like a product. When he says augmented reality and when he says
[00:41:02.720 --> 00:41:05.920]   autonomous movement, he's talking about like- >> Stuff they already have.
[00:41:05.920 --> 00:41:09.440]   >> Having displays. It's like an iPhone has a display, an iPad has a display.
[00:41:09.440 --> 00:41:13.920]   Display is not a product. It's just one of the technologies that are going to enable
[00:41:13.920 --> 00:41:18.560]   a whole generation of products. And they see they very much see AR and VR as next generation
[00:41:18.560 --> 00:41:23.040]   display technologies like mini LED and micro LED. >> But not necessarily headsets.
[00:41:23.040 --> 00:41:30.640]   I think so. We're in that same cycle we were with the Apple television set,
[00:41:30.640 --> 00:41:36.960]   where we spent hours speculating on something that never was going to be released.
[00:41:36.960 --> 00:41:41.280]   And I built at least two prototypes. So I'm guessing Johnny I have used them every Super Bowl.
[00:41:41.280 --> 00:41:44.640]   >> Every Super Bowl. >> If you can get an invite to Johnny's
[00:41:44.640 --> 00:41:51.760]   house for the Super Bowl. There's 720p, 60 Hertz, but still the case on that. The bezels are beautiful.
[00:41:51.760 --> 00:41:54.320]   >> It's beautiful. >> There's virtually no bezels here.
[00:41:54.320 --> 00:41:57.920]   >> There's no bezels. And you can lick it. >> Well, the screen is bigger than the casing.
[00:41:57.920 --> 00:42:06.080]   >> I think there's enough to this that there's definitely something interesting happening.
[00:42:06.080 --> 00:42:12.320]   And like I said, in three or four or five years, we'll look back and go, oh, all of this makes
[00:42:12.320 --> 00:42:17.920]   sense now. But yeah, it really will be a hard engineering problem. And especially like all
[00:42:17.920 --> 00:42:25.760]   the basic stuff that we've seen with other auto driving vehicles already. The basic
[00:42:25.760 --> 00:42:31.840]   processing of swerving out of the way and prioritizing how you avoid having something
[00:42:31.840 --> 00:42:38.400]   escalate into much larger issue very quickly. There are a lot of those things that a person can do
[00:42:38.400 --> 00:42:45.360]   very easily that so far the AI piece of it has utterly failed at. So I think there's a certain
[00:42:45.360 --> 00:42:46.480]   amount of- >> That's kind of what you're saying at the
[00:42:46.480 --> 00:42:51.520]   beginning, really. >> Yeah, there's stuff that Apple tries that doesn't go anywhere,
[00:42:51.520 --> 00:42:55.920]   that isn't going to do anything. But they learn something from it and then take that forward. And
[00:42:55.920 --> 00:43:04.080]   so Renee was saying it's not that Apple necessarily thinks that AR itself is the way, but they think
[00:43:04.080 --> 00:43:09.520]   that democratizing AR, turning it into something lots of people can use, lots of super creative
[00:43:09.520 --> 00:43:14.560]   people with lots of ideas for how AR could be useful in a particular way or fun in a particular
[00:43:14.560 --> 00:43:20.720]   way. That's why we keep seeing it at WWDC every year when they talk about the improvements that
[00:43:20.720 --> 00:43:26.560]   have been made. And now you can play with pretend Lego on your desk just by pointing your iPhone
[00:43:26.560 --> 00:43:32.160]   at it or whatever. That's where those things are coming from is they're democratizing all of that.
[00:43:32.160 --> 00:43:36.160]   So that somebody has a really good idea and can turn that into something great. It's the same thing
[00:43:36.160 --> 00:43:41.680]   we saw with the iPad, it's the same thing we saw with the iPhone. And with the watch and stuff
[00:43:41.680 --> 00:43:46.880]   like increasing the utility of what Apple's doing, helping real more people into the ecosystem,
[00:43:46.880 --> 00:43:51.520]   like all of that is really smart business. So I'm not surprised in the least they're trying all
[00:43:51.520 --> 00:43:56.240]   kinds of stuff to get at it. And I think whatever we get from them is going to be really interesting,
[00:43:56.240 --> 00:44:00.240]   even if it's not something that I personally want to take into my life immediately,
[00:44:00.240 --> 00:44:04.880]   I'm definitely going to be interested in what it is and how it's going to kick the door open for
[00:44:04.880 --> 00:44:10.400]   other people. Well, but again, it also may be nothing that ever is released that. Oh yeah,
[00:44:10.400 --> 00:44:14.640]   it could be. You could go on the shelf and forget it. Any more than you got any more than you got
[00:44:14.640 --> 00:44:19.200]   an Apple television set or a 5G MacBook Air. Everyone is going to do the CSI Miami video for
[00:44:19.200 --> 00:44:22.480]   it. They're going to put it on and go, yeah, and then they're going to do their video. And I'm
[00:44:22.480 --> 00:44:28.000]   just going to want to turn the TV off. Yeah. So just just a reasonable caution. Any company like
[00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:32.160]   Apple, especially Apple, because they have a big R&D budget now and they have a lot of money to
[00:44:32.160 --> 00:44:38.080]   spend is going to be looking for what's next. And it doesn't necessarily mean any of that emerges
[00:44:38.080 --> 00:44:41.920]   from the lab. 1000 knows for yes means you got to make a thousand products. Right. No, too.
[00:44:41.920 --> 00:44:47.440]   Also remember that when also remember that when Apple released the iPhone, everybody knew that
[00:44:47.440 --> 00:44:52.160]   they were working there were probably imminently going to be releasing an iPhone. Everybody was
[00:44:52.160 --> 00:44:56.960]   99% sure was going to happen during the keynote they delivered it by. I don't think anybody
[00:44:56.960 --> 00:45:00.720]   correctly predicted the shape and the form of the phone that they were going to release.
[00:45:00.720 --> 00:45:06.560]   So there's so many variables here that this is where it's I make, I'm not usually like someone
[00:45:06.560 --> 00:45:11.600]   who enjoys rumors because my point of view is that look you're making a rumor about what's
[00:45:11.600 --> 00:45:14.640]   going to be something we're actually going to be having in our hands in eight months.
[00:45:14.640 --> 00:45:17.680]   Even Apple doesn't know exactly what features the next phone is going to have.
[00:45:17.680 --> 00:45:23.120]   It's kind of a waste of time for as far as I'm concerned. But this sort of stuff is really,
[00:45:23.120 --> 00:45:28.000]   really fun because the possibilities for the company like Apple are very, very great. They're not
[00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:32.080]   like the things that you get. You see a CES where it's like, Oh, great. So you have a phone with a
[00:45:32.080 --> 00:45:36.240]   rolling screen. I'm going to count the days until that becomes an actual shipping working product
[00:45:36.240 --> 00:45:40.960]   because I'm sure you wouldn't show it off just to get pressed during CES. Apple works very hard
[00:45:40.960 --> 00:45:45.200]   to make sure they don't get any press before the the magical day. So that's it's going to be fun.
[00:45:45.200 --> 00:45:49.600]   Yeah, I guess that's the important caution for all of this. And as I said at the beginning,
[00:45:49.600 --> 00:45:53.360]   I have one news story and a lot of rumors around it. And so you
[00:45:53.360 --> 00:45:57.280]   I want to talk about the the Black History Month Apple Watch.
[00:45:57.280 --> 00:46:02.320]   We will hang on. Yeah, we will. But this would be a good time to take a little tiny teeny,
[00:46:02.320 --> 00:46:07.360]   weeny break. It's great to have Kelly Guimont with us from the Mac Observer and the Mac Observer
[00:46:07.360 --> 00:46:12.560]   Daily podcast. And go ahead and have a drink. Go ahead and enjoy. Enjoy. What's in that?
[00:46:12.560 --> 00:46:13.200]   We're good.
[00:46:13.200 --> 00:46:14.560]   What's at the other end of that straw?
[00:46:15.440 --> 00:46:19.520]   It's just water. I'm just drinking water out of my nifty blazers glass.
[00:46:19.520 --> 00:46:25.040]   Nifty blazers cup. Normally I spend I feel pretty good about my ability to decipher
[00:46:25.040 --> 00:46:31.200]   nerd t-shirts nerd nerd names. You've got me completely thrown. What does your t-shirt say?
[00:46:31.200 --> 00:46:36.560]   My t-shirt says best guard friends. I'm going to tilt down and go. Best car friends.
[00:46:36.560 --> 00:46:44.000]   No idea. I'm looking at it. I don't know what I'm seeing. So you you you win. I'm going to turn
[00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:46.800]   over all the cards and give you the $50 because well done.
[00:46:46.800 --> 00:46:53.440]   Kelly, it's great to have you. It's not the Leo. What's my t-shirt? It's a whole new game
[00:46:53.440 --> 00:46:59.680]   show. Eddie Enoco also here from WGBH in Boston Enoco.com. And of course the great Renee Richie
[00:46:59.680 --> 00:47:04.720]   eponymously titled YouTube channel YouTube.com/ReneeRitchie.
[00:47:04.720 --> 00:47:10.160]   Do you remember we used to talk a lot about pill pack. I really loved pill pack
[00:47:10.800 --> 00:47:15.360]   because it was an easy way to get my prescriptions and my vitamins and stuff.
[00:47:15.360 --> 00:47:22.240]   Amazon bottom. And now we know what Amazon is doing with pill pack. And I'm so excited about it.
[00:47:22.240 --> 00:47:28.960]   It's called Amazon pharmacy. It is an easy way to get your medication sent to you.
[00:47:28.960 --> 00:47:35.840]   Prescribed by your doctor delivered by Amazon. You can get the meds you need without leaving the
[00:47:35.840 --> 00:47:43.520]   house. Of course these days that's a good thing. One less errand more safety for you. Amazon pharmacy
[00:47:43.520 --> 00:47:49.280]   is every bit as exciting as pill pack even more so it saves you time. Delivers your medication
[00:47:49.280 --> 00:47:55.120]   directly to your door so no more waiting in line at the pharmacy. It's really easy. When you first
[00:47:55.120 --> 00:48:01.920]   go to amazon.com/twitRx and that's our special URL. You can also have your doctor's office send
[00:48:01.920 --> 00:48:07.200]   your next prescription straight to Amazon pharmacy. They can coordinate with your doctor and ensure
[00:48:07.200 --> 00:48:11.600]   everything's accurate. That's important and you're getting what you need. There's a lot of very
[00:48:11.600 --> 00:48:19.120]   cool technology pill pack invented for that precise reason. By the way, I know people always ask can
[00:48:19.120 --> 00:48:24.720]   I use my insurance? Yep. Amazon pharmacy works with most insurance plans nationwide. And here's a
[00:48:24.720 --> 00:48:30.000]   little benefit for Amazon Prime members and who isn't these days. Free two-day delivery. You'll
[00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:36.160]   also save on prescription medication if you're paying without insurance. Clear, understandable
[00:48:36.160 --> 00:48:42.000]   pricing. In fact, I don't know if you've gotten filled a prescription at a pharmacy lately but
[00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:46.480]   you don't usually know the price of your medication until you fill the prescription and then you get
[00:48:46.480 --> 00:48:50.960]   the bill. But Amazon pharmacy will show you right up front your insurance copay the price without
[00:48:50.960 --> 00:48:56.080]   insurance so you can make the right decision. And of course, I absolutely want to emphasize
[00:48:56.080 --> 00:49:02.640]   your medical information is totally protected. The law requires it. And of course, Amazon is very
[00:49:02.640 --> 00:49:07.760]   on top of this. They'll never share your personal health data outside their pharmacy. And yes,
[00:49:07.760 --> 00:49:12.640]   it's a pharmacy, a real pharmacy. That means you can speak with a pharmacist. Their pharmacist on
[00:49:12.640 --> 00:49:19.360]   duty 24/7. So if you have a question, you need some advice. It's always good, I think, especially
[00:49:19.360 --> 00:49:24.880]   with a new medication to talk to the pharmacist. Take advantage of that. That's all part of the
[00:49:24.880 --> 00:49:30.640]   great service. And remember, Amazon Prime members can save on prescription medication
[00:49:30.640 --> 00:49:37.360]   when not using insurance and you get free today delivery. I think this is exciting. Amazon.com/twit
[00:49:37.360 --> 00:49:46.400]   are X. I think this is a real convenience. I got to say, I've been having medication
[00:49:46.400 --> 00:49:50.480]   mailed to me instead of going to the pharmacy now for a little while. And man, I'll never go to
[00:49:50.480 --> 00:49:58.560]   the pharmacy again. Amazon.com/twit are X. Do I need to spell Amazon? They think so. I don't think
[00:49:58.560 --> 00:50:12.080]   so. But they said, please spell it out. AMAZON.com/twit are X. And you could find the pharmacy without
[00:50:12.080 --> 00:50:16.800]   using that, especially URL. But this goes right to the pharmacy. And by the way, you help us when
[00:50:16.800 --> 00:50:23.200]   you use that. Thank you, Amazon, for your support of Mac Brake Weekly Amazon.com/twit are X.
[00:50:23.200 --> 00:50:31.040]   So usually, Apple does their quarterly results on Tuesdays, in which means we have to sign off
[00:50:31.040 --> 00:50:37.280]   early and get everybody out there. It's tomorrow, not today. There's no one left to transcript,
[00:50:37.280 --> 00:50:40.960]   though, Leo. So we're fine now. Oh, God, that's right. It took us a lot of energy to be Laurie.
[00:50:40.960 --> 00:50:48.560]   They took Laurie. Is there anybody left to do that? There's people left there, but nobody involved
[00:50:48.560 --> 00:50:55.040]   with us anymore. No, we don't even know. It's a mystery typist. I think the stock market is excited.
[00:50:55.040 --> 00:51:00.640]   This is normally the fourth calendar quarter, but it's Apple's first quarter, the last quarter of
[00:51:00.640 --> 00:51:06.800]   the year, October, November, December. And of course, it's always Apple's big quarter because
[00:51:06.800 --> 00:51:11.600]   that's when the new iPhones come out. It's not just the new iPhones. This year, it's when all the
[00:51:11.600 --> 00:51:16.800]   like the iPhones only came out in Q1 this year. So it is going to be way more iPhone-y than it
[00:51:16.800 --> 00:51:22.160]   even usually three max with Apple Silicon, which must be selling well. The new Hope on MIDI,
[00:51:22.160 --> 00:51:27.920]   I bought five of them. So I know personally, I've helped. Apple says, thank you. You know what? I
[00:51:27.920 --> 00:51:34.400]   thought I'm going to I like this intercom feature. I like the follow feature. I watched carefully.
[00:51:34.400 --> 00:51:40.800]   Michael Sargent did a head-to-head review of all $300 speakers. And I, you know, he said that the
[00:51:40.800 --> 00:51:46.960]   the AirPods or the HomePod Mini sounds great. He was right, especially for what I use it for,
[00:51:46.960 --> 00:51:51.040]   which is mostly audible books. I love AirPlay going right into it. Makes it very easy.
[00:51:51.040 --> 00:51:56.800]   So I bought five of them. I have a stereo pair in the bedroom. And then I, you know,
[00:51:56.800 --> 00:52:00.560]   I have them throughout the house so they can as I'm listening to my book, they can follow me.
[00:52:00.560 --> 00:52:06.560]   I just think this is a great product. I'm kind of I wasn't a big fan of the HomePods. We had two,
[00:52:06.560 --> 00:52:10.960]   but the Mini is actually pretty cool. The AirPods Max, that's what you're wearing,
[00:52:10.960 --> 00:52:16.800]   your Jordy glasses slash headphones. I doubt they sold a lot of those at that price. But who knows?
[00:52:16.800 --> 00:52:21.280]   The sold all they could. They sold all they could. That's right. That's a good point.
[00:52:21.280 --> 00:52:24.160]   People are still going to wait another couple of months to get them if they ordered them when
[00:52:24.160 --> 00:52:28.640]   they went live because I thought the dates slipped to March like immediately. So yeah,
[00:52:28.640 --> 00:52:31.920]   that's a very good point. Yeah, I couldn't buy it if I wanted to. I have to wait till March.
[00:52:31.920 --> 00:52:40.160]   The iPad Air, the redesigned iPad Air. And let's not forget in services, they introduced Apple One,
[00:52:40.160 --> 00:52:45.360]   Fitness Plus was added to that. So I expect to see a big bump in services.
[00:52:45.360 --> 00:52:50.800]   The stock market. Yeah, the stock market and analysts are predicting a hundred billion
[00:52:50.800 --> 00:52:56.960]   dollar revenue quarter, which would be a record for Apple. The best they did was first quarter
[00:52:56.960 --> 00:52:59.520]   last year, which was 91.8 billion.
[00:52:59.520 --> 00:53:05.200]   You're going to be so tired of waiting to later bone back in 2008, just going, well,
[00:53:05.200 --> 00:53:07.440]   Apple ever sell 10 million iPhones.
[00:53:07.440 --> 00:53:15.520]   And we were debating this just back in 2000. Remember when when everybody first got a look at the
[00:53:15.520 --> 00:53:21.600]   OG iPhone people went, who on earth is going to carry a fun carry around a phone that big?
[00:53:21.600 --> 00:53:24.960]   Yeah, Steve Ballmer said that. Yeah, I mean,
[00:53:24.960 --> 00:53:29.920]   lots of people said that. Yeah, and the black and the palm,
[00:53:29.920 --> 00:53:34.560]   and Coligan, the palm cat, pilot guy. So many people misunderstood the important,
[00:53:34.560 --> 00:53:40.480]   the impact of the iPhone. You can get, you can get caught in a trap by being like the
[00:53:40.480 --> 00:53:45.120]   beard stroking, fantasies of yes, but the potential of this technology, what you,
[00:53:45.120 --> 00:53:50.240]   you were seeing what it is now. I'm seeing what it could be. But with the iPhone,
[00:53:50.240 --> 00:53:54.240]   that was the case of you really did have to think about, okay, here's a phone that doesn't do,
[00:53:54.800 --> 00:53:57.600]   doesn't have a keyboard, doesn't do cut copy paste, doesn't have apps,
[00:53:57.600 --> 00:54:03.200]   stuck on slower bandwidth, is only locked to one provider is super expensive.
[00:54:03.200 --> 00:54:07.520]   Do we think the iPhone, I heard a really good, I heard a really good breakdown of why it worked.
[00:54:07.520 --> 00:54:10.720]   And one of the key points that I never really thought about was that because it was an iPod.
[00:54:10.720 --> 00:54:16.160]   And none of the other phones back then could compete with an iPod. So the idea of your iPod,
[00:54:16.160 --> 00:54:20.080]   but it could do all these other phone things, which is transformative for people. And it built
[00:54:20.080 --> 00:54:24.320]   on the entire economy that Apple had, that Apple had created with iTunes and the iPod. And that
[00:54:24.320 --> 00:54:29.440]   just, it took other companies years to get this music into their solutions.
[00:54:29.440 --> 00:54:30.000]   Yeah.
[00:54:30.000 --> 00:54:30.560]   Yeah.
[00:54:30.560 --> 00:54:31.040]   Yeah.
[00:54:31.040 --> 00:54:40.240]   So, do you think the 12, well, we'll know, I guess, I mean, they don't break out sales figures anymore.
[00:54:40.240 --> 00:54:41.920]   But do you think the 12 was a success?
[00:54:41.920 --> 00:54:47.360]   12 Pro is overperforming. They're moving capacity from the mini to the 12,
[00:54:47.360 --> 00:54:50.960]   which I think everybody thought no one's going to get the 12 Pro. They'll go for the max.
[00:54:50.960 --> 00:54:54.880]   Maybe they'll go for the mini or the other, their 12 is so close to the Pro. They'll save a couple
[00:54:54.880 --> 00:54:59.040]   of hundred bucks. But it looks like, which was my thought in the beginning that the 12 Pro is so
[00:54:59.040 --> 00:55:03.280]   close to the 12 that they're just throwing in a couple extra hundred bucks to get the other camera.
[00:55:03.280 --> 00:55:05.920]   And it's, it's overperforming compared to market estimates.
[00:55:05.920 --> 00:55:06.160]   Yeah.
[00:55:06.160 --> 00:55:15.120]   That's what I did. Like, I mean, I mean, I got the 12 Pro because I fell in love with the 11 Pro.
[00:55:15.120 --> 00:55:20.240]   And even after having the 11 Pro for a year and putting the low light camera through its
[00:55:20.240 --> 00:55:26.400]   paces on the Pro, I couldn't go back. Like, I really wanted the mini and realized that the
[00:55:26.400 --> 00:55:29.760]   camera and the 12 Pro is not the camera and the mini. So I got the Pro.
[00:55:29.760 --> 00:55:34.960]   Oh, that's interesting. So you like the size of the mini, but the mini, it seems to be lagging a
[00:55:34.960 --> 00:55:41.040]   little bit. The mini is compatible with this size of a hand. Yeah. Little hands, but the mini
[00:55:41.040 --> 00:55:46.240]   is a big part. Like the original SE was both smaller and less expensive. And now you have
[00:55:46.240 --> 00:55:51.360]   smaller with the new SE and so you have smaller with the mini and less expensive with the new SE.
[00:55:51.360 --> 00:55:54.480]   And so each of them only appealing to half the market of the original.
[00:55:54.480 --> 00:56:01.280]   In past years, the standard, like the iPhone 12, the iPhone 11, those would be the best sellers.
[00:56:01.280 --> 00:56:05.120]   But you think the Pro this year is bigger, do you think?
[00:56:06.880 --> 00:56:12.720]   I think it'll split more. I think a lot of people, again, tech, Twitter and tech YouTube nerds are
[00:56:12.720 --> 00:56:15.920]   really bad at predicting the market because they just assume that they're the majority.
[00:56:15.920 --> 00:56:20.320]   Everyone is their majority market. They have no idea what people are doing.
[00:56:20.320 --> 00:56:26.000]   I see a lot of shortsightedness in that. So, yeah. But it was the 10R and then it was the 11.
[00:56:26.000 --> 00:56:30.320]   Those are the best selling phones of those respective years. And I think even though the 12 Pro is
[00:56:30.320 --> 00:56:35.920]   overperforming, I think the 12 is still going to keep that. It's a lot of value at a lower price.
[00:56:35.920 --> 00:56:41.280]   And that's also the one the carriers advertise. They clearly, and I think the carriers have a
[00:56:41.280 --> 00:56:48.000]   lot of information about what people want. They clearly feel like the 12 is the sweet spot again
[00:56:48.000 --> 00:56:52.560]   this year. We won't know. We won't get a breakdown, right? There's no way to-
[00:56:52.560 --> 00:56:57.360]   It could be the 11. I mean, like the 10R was performing marvelously last year.
[00:56:57.360 --> 00:57:02.080]   Really well. It might still be performing really well. So the 11 might be the best seller still.
[00:57:02.080 --> 00:57:07.680]   The 11 Pro this year could be the hotness because it'll still come in. It's still an amazing camera
[00:57:07.680 --> 00:57:14.960]   and it'll still come in under 12 Pro prices. So if you still pink puffy heart those curved sides
[00:57:14.960 --> 00:57:19.520]   on the iPhone and that's your jam, then there you go. That's really going to be, I think,
[00:57:19.520 --> 00:57:25.600]   a far more important deciding factor than a lot of people think is the
[00:57:28.480 --> 00:57:33.440]   slightly less old school curved sides or the honest to god old school of the slab,
[00:57:33.440 --> 00:57:39.440]   the 90 degree straight edges on the 12, which I personally love very much.
[00:57:39.440 --> 00:57:45.600]   And the Pro has that extra lens. That's the reason you got to kill the better camera.
[00:57:45.600 --> 00:57:53.360]   It is. And the computational photography piece of it is a little bit higher power than on the 12.
[00:57:53.920 --> 00:57:58.960]   And I really like that. And if they had a bit of optimism that I'm going to get to go places
[00:57:58.960 --> 00:58:05.920]   again with the 12, and get to go take awesome pictures of Disneyland in low-lit rides and not
[00:58:05.920 --> 00:58:11.120]   need a flash and it's going to be great. So I am looking forward to doing that again. So I'm
[00:58:11.120 --> 00:58:18.000]   going to go full that because I didn't really get to go. I got to go one place with my 11 Pro
[00:58:18.000 --> 00:58:21.760]   and then the world fell apart. And so I'm looking for getting my 12 Pro somewhere.
[00:58:22.240 --> 00:58:24.400]   Aw, that sucks.
[00:58:24.400 --> 00:58:30.480]   Yeah, Washington DC. So it was fun. I did take a load of pictures when I was there. But
[00:58:30.480 --> 00:58:35.120]   yeah, I'm looking forward to getting to go to Disneyland because I do have a few pictures I
[00:58:35.120 --> 00:58:39.360]   like to take that I've taken with every phone because it gets a little bit better at low light
[00:58:39.360 --> 00:58:45.680]   every time. So I have the evolution of that one spot and that one ride over time through all of
[00:58:45.680 --> 00:58:50.720]   Apple's. Careful of the selfies in the house chamber though. You might want to not do that
[00:58:50.720 --> 00:58:55.680]   this time around. Yeah, I'll keep that in mind. If you're sitting in Nancy Pelosi's seat,
[00:58:55.680 --> 00:58:59.120]   I'd stay away from the selfies. It's just a thought, you know, just a thought. Well,
[00:58:59.120 --> 00:59:02.640]   any Congress person seat for any Congress anywhere. If you're going through the desks,
[00:59:02.640 --> 00:59:06.640]   maybe not video it. If you're committing acts of trees and do not take selfies.
[00:59:06.640 --> 00:59:12.320]   No, no selfie. Actually, if you are, please take selfies. Take them all as many as you can.
[00:59:12.320 --> 00:59:15.680]   Did you see they they they pause something? I forget what it was, but they pause something
[00:59:15.680 --> 00:59:20.000]   on the dating apps because people were honey potting all of the other people. I saw you.
[00:59:20.000 --> 00:59:22.000]   They took really hot. Yeah. Pumble.
[00:59:22.000 --> 00:59:26.960]   Political affiliation out because a bunch of ladies set their affiliation to right wing
[00:59:26.960 --> 00:59:30.400]   and had dudes immediately start to warm them and braggin on all the stuff they did.
[00:59:30.400 --> 00:59:36.720]   Honey pot. They worked. They're not the smartest people in the world. I'm finding her.
[00:59:36.720 --> 00:59:43.920]   I guess if you dress up with bull with with buffalo horns and chaps.
[00:59:43.920 --> 00:59:47.520]   I love songs up. There was that great scene in the West Wing where the
[00:59:47.520 --> 00:59:50.960]   president says, how did you find these people? He says, sir, swear to God, I've been doing this
[00:59:50.960 --> 00:59:55.600]   job for a long time. And there is no amount of money or manpower that beats a criminal just being
[00:59:55.600 --> 01:00:00.560]   stupid. Yeah. A criminal stupid. I can't be told that by the Secret Service many years ago,
[01:00:00.560 --> 01:00:05.040]   Patrick Norton and I went to the Secret Service to talk to them about, I don't know,
[01:00:05.040 --> 01:00:09.360]   I don't know what we were able to tell them, but about computers or something. And you know,
[01:00:09.360 --> 01:00:13.840]   passwords and encryption. And yeah, that's exactly what they said is that, you know,
[01:00:13.840 --> 01:00:17.680]   most of the time they just give us the password. They just say here, here,
[01:00:17.680 --> 01:00:22.080]   dramatonic cleric. Ask them for it. It's not that hard.
[01:00:22.080 --> 01:00:28.800]   These are these are not the people who bravely go to prison and then spend 10 years writing the
[01:00:28.800 --> 01:00:32.480]   writing the manifesto. These are the people like, plea bargain.
[01:00:32.480 --> 01:00:42.160]   They are not experts on game theory in the prisoners dilemma. Let's put it that way.
[01:00:42.160 --> 01:00:48.240]   But they are at selfies. Yeah, very good at selfies. So what are we, is there anything to think about
[01:00:48.240 --> 01:00:53.440]   for tomorrow that we should be looking for? I'm going to be looking at services. I expect services
[01:00:53.440 --> 01:01:00.480]   to be be a very big part of their revenue. What was it? 13 billion last time, maybe 14 or 15 billion.
[01:01:00.480 --> 01:01:04.240]   It's really been coming on strong. And that's where Apple's been putting a lot of the,
[01:01:04.240 --> 01:01:08.400]   what I don't want to say it would behind their arrows. Is that what they?
[01:01:09.120 --> 01:01:12.720]   I wonder if they're going to address it any different. I can't imagine that
[01:01:12.720 --> 01:01:17.120]   putting a lot of developers into the million dollar or less program is going to have a material
[01:01:17.120 --> 01:01:21.680]   impact on their earnings because most of the people over that, like it's all those in app
[01:01:21.680 --> 01:01:27.600]   transaction games that make the vast majority. I think it's 5% of developers who are in this new
[01:01:27.600 --> 01:01:33.680]   15% club. But I wonder if they'll talk about that at all just as a community builder.
[01:01:33.680 --> 01:01:38.160]   Good feeling sort of thing. Yeah. That was the thing I was wondering about was like the warm fuzzies.
[01:01:38.160 --> 01:01:42.240]   They want to try and take all the warm fuzzies from that they can get. And I think that's probably
[01:01:42.240 --> 01:01:47.680]   something we'll get announced and probably fitness. I'm curious what fitness plus looks like.
[01:01:47.680 --> 01:01:54.880]   I'm sure they'll talk about the bundles, but I would like to know if they tell us anything about
[01:01:54.880 --> 01:02:02.000]   actual signups for fitness and maybe a little bit of sunlight into why no still nobody has to pay
[01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:09.040]   for TV plus. Yeah, through April now, right? I'm making any shows July July. Yeah. Yeah.
[01:02:09.040 --> 01:02:16.320]   Yeah. So I saw something like 70 or 80% 70 or 80% of TV plus users are not paying for it. Yeah.
[01:02:16.320 --> 01:02:21.680]   That's not a good revenue model. But again, this is the beauty of being Apple. You don't have to
[01:02:21.680 --> 01:02:26.320]   make money on it yet. But they also keep giving it away. Like it wasn't until February, which sort
[01:02:26.320 --> 01:02:31.280]   of made sense because like then all the bundle stuff kind of came into alignment. So it made sense
[01:02:31.280 --> 01:02:34.480]   if it was only five bucks a month, like we'll eat it for another couple months. So everybody
[01:02:34.480 --> 01:02:40.720]   signs up for their tier of Apple one and make it all make sense. And then now it's July and we
[01:02:40.720 --> 01:02:46.720]   don't know why. Well, I'm an idiot because I bought Apple one plus. So I'm paying for something I
[01:02:46.720 --> 01:02:52.800]   didn't have to pay for, I guess. You are the 20% Leo. Yeah, that's that's right. I'm in the 20%
[01:02:52.800 --> 01:03:00.640]   I have to get a t-shirt. But I do you think that's what's going on? Like apples just because I would
[01:03:00.640 --> 01:03:04.320]   guess there's a lot of people saying, well, I'm not going to sign up for Apple one plus because I
[01:03:04.320 --> 01:03:10.080]   I'm getting TV plus free. So I'm going to wait a lot of ends. So that would be a negative consequence
[01:03:10.080 --> 01:03:16.000]   deferring it. Well, and that's why I wonder like it seems like that's going to be that would be the
[01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:23.840]   service TV plus an arcade or the two that it's easiest for Apple to like eat the cost on like those
[01:03:23.840 --> 01:03:28.480]   can be the last leaders like you're if you sign up for the bundle, you get TV plus for free. Or if
[01:03:28.480 --> 01:03:33.680]   you sign up for the bundle, you get arcade for free. And for a lot of people, that may be the thing
[01:03:33.680 --> 01:03:38.720]   that signs up like I'm paying the same amount of money, but I get a free thing. So I'm there. And
[01:03:38.720 --> 01:03:44.400]   not I don't think there's a lot of people who would necessarily go out of their way to pay for
[01:03:44.400 --> 01:03:50.480]   it itself. So but the thing that I'm wondering about is what's going to make it compelling in
[01:03:50.480 --> 01:03:57.360]   July, like how they're going to, you know, it gets extended. But then how do you convince people now
[01:03:57.360 --> 01:04:03.280]   that you've had it for a year and a half at that point, that it's really time for you to start paying
[01:04:03.280 --> 01:04:08.160]   for it, whether it's as part of a bundle or not. Like I get why the new stuff is never the thing that
[01:04:08.160 --> 01:04:15.440]   they can sort of subsidize like that's going to always be 10 bucks a month, no matter what. So,
[01:04:15.440 --> 01:04:20.480]   you know, these are the ones that they can sort of give away. And so that's why, you know, that's
[01:04:20.480 --> 01:04:24.320]   that is why they were free for a year to begin with was sort of to reel everybody in. But now I
[01:04:24.320 --> 01:04:29.840]   don't know how they're going to convert anybody like me who looks at it. You know, like I'm probably
[01:04:29.840 --> 01:04:34.240]   likely to go well, it's five bucks a month. I'll just pay it. But I don't know how they're going to get
[01:04:34.240 --> 01:04:39.360]   a lot of people who are paying for loads and loads of other services, you know, and now paying more
[01:04:39.360 --> 01:04:45.520]   for all of the plus services and Hulu and Netflix and prime video. And you know, like now you're
[01:04:45.520 --> 01:04:48.720]   paying more than you were paying for cable. So like this, you know, the first stuff to make the
[01:04:48.720 --> 01:04:52.480]   cuts going to be the things that you're not necessarily into. And I don't know how they're
[01:04:52.480 --> 01:04:57.920]   generating a huge bunch of fans on a lot of these because you could take a walk with Dolly Parton.
[01:04:57.920 --> 01:05:04.080]   That's how I can do that. I signed up for fitness plus and I don't have a bundle.
[01:05:04.080 --> 01:05:10.000]   Right. And I can see I can I'm walking nine to five with nine to you're going to slowly be doing
[01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:13.440]   you're going to get there. Got you. You know, you're going to be doing the bundle eventually,
[01:05:13.440 --> 01:05:18.320]   don't you think I paid for fitness plus for a year. So it's going to be next January before they get
[01:05:18.320 --> 01:05:25.120]   to me. You don't buy iCloud storage. You don't. My iCloud storage is like a dollar a month
[01:05:25.120 --> 01:05:31.760]   and then because I only need a little and then I know why. Renewal on Apple music is tough to beat.
[01:05:31.760 --> 01:05:36.240]   It doesn't make sense if you it makes a lot more sense if you have a family. Yes,
[01:05:36.240 --> 01:05:41.120]   because that because I'm getting five accounts and you know, there's three of us at home,
[01:05:41.120 --> 01:05:46.800]   but my mom is on my family plan. My kids are my adult kids are my family. Because that's
[01:05:46.800 --> 01:05:52.720]   so that's a great value. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That makes sense. Even if I was sharing with Mr. Kelly,
[01:05:52.720 --> 01:05:59.520]   you wouldn't like it still doesn't quite pencil out. Yeah. So the walking with Dolly Barton is a new
[01:05:59.520 --> 01:06:05.440]   feature in fitness plus they're going to do a walks. And at first, I was all excited. Maybe they put
[01:06:05.440 --> 01:06:10.960]   podcasts in this, but really what it is, it's going to be like celebrities walk with Sean Mendez,
[01:06:11.600 --> 01:06:17.360]   walk with Dolly Parton. This is called the time all celebrities. I think they just wanted to get
[01:06:17.360 --> 01:06:21.680]   attention. The weird the thing for me that I found, what I didn't expect is I thought it would be
[01:06:21.680 --> 01:06:27.360]   podcasts or like audiobooks. Yeah. But so far, all of them are actually walking and talking to you
[01:06:27.360 --> 01:06:31.440]   about walking. They're actually watching. And then just say, Hey to people. Yeah. So it's like,
[01:06:31.440 --> 01:06:35.120]   it's meant like they're really walking with you. That's really interesting. It's like caused a
[01:06:35.120 --> 01:06:38.640]   bunch of cognitive dissonance with me when I first heard it. Oh, I haven't tried it yet.
[01:06:38.640 --> 01:06:44.400]   It's odd. Yeah. That's really cool. Get to walk with Dolly Parton. So she's walking along.
[01:06:44.400 --> 01:06:50.240]   She'll have a breath. Yeah. Some of them. Well, some of them are hiking. Some of them are just
[01:06:50.240 --> 01:06:54.000]   walking locally. Some of them are hiking. They're out of breath. They don't answer. Like, I thought
[01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:58.240]   to be like, once they're walking with me, can we have a conversation? No, they don't respond. Someone's
[01:06:58.240 --> 01:07:03.600]   walking ahead of you just talking like on a city tour or something. This is wild. It would really
[01:07:03.600 --> 01:07:08.240]   hurt me bad if a 70 something year old woman in the heels were able to out walk me.
[01:07:09.120 --> 01:07:10.560]   I was still I was still. I was still. I was still. I was. You know, she can.
[01:07:10.560 --> 01:07:14.960]   Dolly Parton. Yeah, exactly. I feel like she probably can. More energy. Yeah. So different people
[01:07:14.960 --> 01:07:21.760]   have different lengths. Dolly Parton is a 25 minute walk. Dremon Green of the Warriors is 33
[01:07:21.760 --> 01:07:29.760]   is a basketball player is a 33 minute walk. Who's Uzo Aduba? She's on orange is the new black. Oh,
[01:07:29.760 --> 01:07:34.800]   I recognize her. And a lot of people might know her. Yeah. She's all dressed up now. If she were in
[01:07:34.800 --> 01:07:39.760]   orange jumpsuit, I'd recognize her right away. 39 minutes. So she's she's the walking queen.
[01:07:39.760 --> 01:07:47.360]   Sean Mendez, of course, he can only do 28 minutes, you know, generation Z. And so that's so but
[01:07:47.360 --> 01:07:52.480]   you're going to have other people to walk with you. I'd like to do once a week until all the way
[01:07:52.480 --> 01:07:55.520]   through April, I think so far they've committed to and they said a lot of that some of them may
[01:07:55.520 --> 01:07:59.040]   not be well known. They just they start I think they front loaded it with some celebrity. Oh, but
[01:07:59.040 --> 01:08:04.960]   imagine. I mean, think who you could you could take walks with physicists and I want Tim Cook
[01:08:04.960 --> 01:08:09.200]   because he's a hiker. Really? Well, I would love to like just listen to Tim Cook talk about stuff
[01:08:09.200 --> 01:08:13.520]   for an hour while he's hiking. Oh, I would start listening. Why would you not start with that?
[01:08:13.520 --> 01:08:19.520]   Like, why was he like him and Dolly Parton? And I'm good for a while. Like, that would be fine.
[01:08:19.520 --> 01:08:26.320]   Now that's a YouTube channel. I would definitely support on Patreon. If it's just Tim Cook and
[01:08:26.320 --> 01:08:31.040]   somebody just taking a hike together or or just Tim Cook and Dolly Parton every single episode.
[01:08:31.040 --> 01:08:35.360]   Yeah, like I'd be into that. That'd be awesome. Yeah, pretty cool. And I'm sad. I'll never listen
[01:08:35.360 --> 01:08:41.680]   to all of them because I'm from earlier in the show. I'm a huge blazers fan and I could care
[01:08:41.680 --> 01:08:47.520]   less what Draymond Green has to say. You don't have to listen to Raymond. It's okay. I will.
[01:08:47.520 --> 01:08:52.320]   Call me when they get Damien Lillard to walk with me and I will walk with Damien Lillard anywhere
[01:08:52.320 --> 01:08:55.840]   Damien Lillard wants to walk because Dame Dolla's where it's at. Thank you.
[01:08:55.840 --> 01:08:59.920]   And by the way, this doesn't just sell Apple watches, but you would see Bluetooth head
[01:08:59.920 --> 01:09:04.960]   you need AirPods to do this, right? Just Bluetooth headphones. It doesn't have to be apples.
[01:09:04.960 --> 01:09:11.520]   No, just wireless headphones that will connect to your watch as Andrew pointed out when we talked
[01:09:11.520 --> 01:09:18.640]   about daily observations. There's no headphone jack on your watch. Yeah, yeah. Oh, I'm glad it
[01:09:18.640 --> 01:09:22.640]   doesn't have to be AirPods. So I can put my after because I like to walk with you aftershucks
[01:09:22.640 --> 01:09:26.640]   because then I can hear what's going on. Yeah, aftershucks are awesome. Yeah, yeah. Yeah,
[01:09:26.640 --> 01:09:31.440]   Mr. Kelly has a pair and he really he also likes them for hiking. Right. Yeah, because you can
[01:09:31.440 --> 01:09:36.240]   hear what's going on. So I'm going to be listening to Dolly. I don't care if she doesn't answer. I'm
[01:09:36.240 --> 01:09:42.480]   talking to her Renee. I don't care. And let's want to be like in real life. Anyway, we'd be talking
[01:09:42.480 --> 01:09:48.480]   and she would just be walking. She just keep walking. You know, I walk with my wife and Lisa,
[01:09:48.480 --> 01:09:53.360]   I don't know how she does it because she's not she's shorter than me, but her stride is somehow
[01:09:53.360 --> 01:09:58.400]   much longer than me. And so she is exactly like walking with Lisa. She's 10 feet ahead of me
[01:09:58.400 --> 01:10:05.360]   talking and I'm just going to I'm out of breath. Anyway, I can't Lisa has intent. Does Mr. We might
[01:10:05.360 --> 01:10:12.080]   walk faster or slower than you, Kelly. He's taller than me and I always had to walk faster to keep up
[01:10:12.080 --> 01:10:17.120]   with people. So I think Lisa and I are in the same camp with that. I think women walk faster.
[01:10:17.120 --> 01:10:22.640]   You learn to take longer steps. Like your stride is a little longer than it might be naturally because
[01:10:22.640 --> 01:10:27.440]   you have to keep up with taller people. That explains. I've always been that person. Yeah,
[01:10:27.440 --> 01:10:35.040]   I can zip off out, you know, to do what I need to do. I'm a stroller. I'm not a huffer. I like
[01:10:35.040 --> 01:10:41.680]   to stroll. I need to. I can I can get after I'm actually fairly well known for my leisurely face.
[01:10:41.840 --> 01:10:49.040]   There's a reason that the word Kelly Dally is a word that exists in my house. Kelly Dally. I love it.
[01:10:49.040 --> 01:10:53.360]   Let's Kelly Dally is it a constitutional deal? Are you out for your constitution? I'm out for my
[01:10:53.360 --> 01:10:59.520]   exactly. I'm that guy. Exactly. Your promenade. Yeah. My promenade. My dad is like, I take a camera
[01:10:59.520 --> 01:11:04.160]   with me and every time I get really, really tired, I say, Oh, that's a really interesting bush. I
[01:11:04.160 --> 01:11:08.640]   think I'll look at the way it's framed against the clouds. I think I'll stop here and lay down for
[01:11:08.640 --> 01:11:14.400]   the lower angle for the dramatic lower angle. But at least I'm outside. At least I'm outside.
[01:11:14.400 --> 01:11:20.640]   I never take a walk with a photographer because he'll never get anywhere. It is the slowest,
[01:11:20.640 --> 01:11:29.120]   the slowest process. I seven years ago took a trip to Tasmania in Australia with 10 very famous
[01:11:29.120 --> 01:11:34.400]   well known photographers. I was kind of their mascot and we drove across Tasmania, but it took
[01:11:34.400 --> 01:11:40.320]   us a long time because every five miles is a cow. We all have to jump out of the car,
[01:11:40.320 --> 01:11:44.320]   take 100 pictures of the cow, jump back in the car. It was not a good, not a.
[01:11:44.320 --> 01:11:50.320]   I spent a really great day in London with with Chris Breen. We took a long walk. Yeah.
[01:11:50.320 --> 01:11:55.600]   We took a long walk through Hampstead Heath. I was just looking at my pictures. This is like
[01:11:55.600 --> 01:12:00.560]   10 years ago. And I'm looking at my pictures. So many of them are like a really great. I have a
[01:12:00.560 --> 01:12:06.080]   great great photo of like a pathway with like Chris Breen's back like way in the distance,
[01:12:06.080 --> 01:12:10.400]   where I've got a great of a pond and there's there's where Chris Breen like
[01:12:10.400 --> 01:12:15.840]   stopped waiting for me and like kept going on. So yeah, that is that is an issue.
[01:12:15.840 --> 01:12:19.120]   There's a lot there. This is interesting. There really is a lot of potential.
[01:12:19.120 --> 01:12:25.520]   This is it's I think this is kind of clever of Apple. It isn't podcasts. It's not audiobooks.
[01:12:26.320 --> 01:12:31.920]   It's actually walking with people you would like to walk with. Do you think that maybe they could do
[01:12:31.920 --> 01:12:37.680]   time to have lunch and have a you know, I mean, this could be a whole new series for Apple.
[01:12:37.680 --> 01:12:41.200]   Hanging out with Gary Vee and you wouldn't be able to get a bite in.
[01:12:41.200 --> 01:12:47.920]   Well, that's the U.E. I'll talk. It's perfect. It wouldn't be great if they could if this
[01:12:47.920 --> 01:12:52.640]   became a publishing platform that someone someone who even someone who's not famous,
[01:12:52.640 --> 01:12:56.560]   but they live in Boston and here's their walking. Here's here's a lot that really like I would
[01:12:56.560 --> 01:13:00.960]   really like to do that with you. Lisa was talking about your tour of the Boston
[01:13:00.960 --> 01:13:07.920]   Library. When I next time I'm out there, I'm going with you. And that would be a perfect example.
[01:13:07.920 --> 01:13:15.040]   Yeah, but I would go to another city. I would say who who has some really interesting walks
[01:13:15.040 --> 01:13:19.920]   that would get me out of the hotel and what or even just again in Boston. There walks it.
[01:13:19.920 --> 01:13:23.760]   There are walks that I'm focused on, but there are walks that I wouldn't be focused on. So it's
[01:13:23.760 --> 01:13:28.080]   great to have if you're a fan of OK, who isn't a fan of Dolly Parton, but it's great to have
[01:13:28.080 --> 01:13:32.880]   someone that a celebrity whose voice you really like. But then there's the there's the people that,
[01:13:32.880 --> 01:13:38.080]   hey, look, all I know is this really, really, really great path. It goes through this piece of
[01:13:38.080 --> 01:13:42.160]   conservation land. Now you're going to think this is a dirt gravel driveway to a private house,
[01:13:42.160 --> 01:13:46.400]   but it isn't. It's actually the trailhead and it's public. Oh, man, I really want to take a walk.
[01:13:46.400 --> 01:13:51.680]   Now I'm going to I can't I'm going to do this tonight. This is great. Yeah, it would be awesome
[01:13:51.680 --> 01:13:57.520]   if there were local ones that you could do like where you could find like here's 25 minutes
[01:13:57.520 --> 01:14:02.560]   through Forest Park in Portland with. Wouldn't that be cool or well, maybe they will do that
[01:14:02.560 --> 01:14:06.400]   to go through the library with Andy or something like that would be awesome. I hope Apple does
[01:14:06.400 --> 01:14:12.000]   that that's a great idea. And there's a GPS in the watch. So you could totally have it be
[01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:17.200]   points of interest. Right. I mean, the watch knows where you are, right? Or if it just gives you a
[01:14:17.200 --> 01:14:21.200]   tone in your headset that says, Oh, by the way, if you want to stop and check your phone, there's
[01:14:21.200 --> 01:14:24.960]   something interesting and there's some content if you want to stop there already is that for the
[01:14:24.960 --> 01:14:30.160]   if you want if you want an excuse to stop. Yeah, I there are these great GPS guides for the iPhone
[01:14:30.160 --> 01:14:36.160]   and actually for Android too. I use them in Hawaii where you you put it on the car and you start
[01:14:36.160 --> 01:14:41.920]   driving. And that's exactly what the guy says. It's like it's like some old guy in the backseat is
[01:14:41.920 --> 01:14:48.480]   really kind of girl is if you'd like to see the waterfalls turn left here. And then he tells
[01:14:48.480 --> 01:14:52.560]   you stories on the way, but I they were called what would they call I can't remember. But there's a
[01:14:52.560 --> 01:14:57.600]   whole there's a there's a couple of companies that make these. And they're really great because
[01:14:57.600 --> 01:15:04.160]   it's it is like having a tour guide in a car with you. But on a walk, I'm excited now. I'm really
[01:15:04.160 --> 01:15:11.440]   excited. I can't wait. I John someone in the chat said walking TED talk and I only got out in the
[01:15:11.440 --> 01:15:16.240]   corner of my eye and I was like, wait, I can take a walk with Ted Lasso. And then I was really
[01:15:16.240 --> 01:15:23.120]   excited about that too. Maybe the thing is, if it's a walking TED talk, you have to make sure
[01:15:23.120 --> 01:15:28.240]   you're wearing like you're really, really tall like rubber boots because the BS is probably
[01:15:28.240 --> 01:15:34.240]   going to be high. But Ted Lasso, that would be fun. I would say you know, I could say
[01:15:34.240 --> 01:15:37.760]   that last. So you know, that would be great. That would totally be a good time. Yeah.
[01:15:37.760 --> 01:15:45.760]   All right, let's take a little break. iOS 14 for is out. We'll talk about what that is.
[01:15:45.760 --> 01:15:48.960]   Before we take a break, is there anything else to say about the quarterly results tomorrow?
[01:15:48.960 --> 01:15:54.720]   It's just going to be it's going to be a good quarter. It's so much money. I'm just all I was
[01:15:54.720 --> 01:15:58.640]   going to say was that I'm really, like you said, I'm really interested to see what they say about
[01:15:58.640 --> 01:16:04.960]   Apple TV plus, but what their what their goal is, whether the extension of the freebie is largely
[01:16:04.960 --> 01:16:09.040]   due to production being shot down and realizing they're not going to have a lot of product to
[01:16:09.040 --> 01:16:13.760]   put into the channel. And also what the win, what they consider a win for this channel is going to
[01:16:13.760 --> 01:16:18.160]   be. What is the success for this channel at any given point in time? And the good these, but these,
[01:16:18.160 --> 01:16:22.560]   it sounds like boring financial results, but this is always, always fun because there's only a couple
[01:16:22.560 --> 01:16:28.480]   times a year where a CEO is bound by law that they could be punished severely if they say anything
[01:16:28.480 --> 01:16:34.160]   that could be misconstrued as a lie. And it's these calls that are part of this is guidance for
[01:16:34.160 --> 01:16:38.400]   investors. So if they say that, Oh, yes, well, we're our Apple, we're building an Apple car and
[01:16:38.400 --> 01:16:42.400]   we'll definitely ship it by the end of the year. Okay, they're problems if they don't ship it.
[01:16:42.400 --> 01:16:44.080]   So can only do that if you're Elon Musk.
[01:16:44.080 --> 01:16:49.520]   And they're downsides to be being Elon Musk that will supersede to be
[01:16:49.520 --> 01:16:55.120]   Elon Musk. Don't worry about it. Okay, this is this is good. This is good. Did they send out?
[01:16:55.120 --> 01:16:58.240]   When did they tell people who could go through July? Kelly, did that just happen?
[01:16:58.240 --> 01:17:04.880]   The last over the last week or so, I think people have started getting emails. We saw reports of it
[01:17:04.880 --> 01:17:10.560]   that it had been extended, I think, late last week. I feel like it was going to be July.
[01:17:10.560 --> 01:17:13.440]   I've been paying for it. You know, paying enough content.
[01:17:13.440 --> 01:17:18.320]   I've watched servant the second season of servants coming out. I like that.
[01:17:18.960 --> 01:17:21.360]   I hope they do another season of Ted Lasso.
[01:17:21.360 --> 01:17:26.000]   There are three total. They've already said there's three seasons. Yeah.
[01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:30.960]   Second season just started filming a couple of weeks ago. And I don't know how they're managing
[01:17:30.960 --> 01:17:35.120]   that. They are. And then there's a third season officially confirmed.
[01:17:35.120 --> 01:17:42.400]   I'm a member of SAG-AFTRA. The Union magazine came out and said lights, camera, safety.
[01:17:42.960 --> 01:17:48.400]   So they're actually they're doing a lot because they want to get back in production. I mean,
[01:17:48.400 --> 01:17:53.280]   that's a lot of people out of work. Not just the people in front of the camera,
[01:17:53.280 --> 01:17:58.240]   but there's hundreds of people behind the camera from craft people to the gaffers to the
[01:17:58.240 --> 01:18:04.000]   DP. You want to make calm crews angry again. They are not working and the writers and they're
[01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:09.280]   all not working. And of course, the demand is high from the streamers. We need more content.
[01:18:09.280 --> 01:18:14.640]   We need more content. So I think they're doing it fairly safely. My favorite anecdote about this
[01:18:14.640 --> 01:18:20.640]   is the soap operas went back to work. And you can shoot it so that you wear a mask until you're
[01:18:20.640 --> 01:18:25.280]   on camera and they take it off. You do your scene and then they do the reverses and people put their
[01:18:25.280 --> 01:18:28.800]   masks on and take it off. The only problems in the soap operas, there's love scenes.
[01:18:28.800 --> 01:18:35.760]   So what they've been doing, I didn't realize this, they've been bringing in the actor's spouse or
[01:18:35.760 --> 01:18:41.680]   significant other to play the love scene. And they just shoot her from the back or him from the back.
[01:18:41.680 --> 01:18:46.800]   So you don't know. It's not the character. It's there, but apparently it works.
[01:18:46.800 --> 01:18:51.120]   So they're just going to want to do that forever. They're like, we could have done this the whole
[01:18:51.120 --> 01:18:58.080]   time. I don't want to kiss my wife. Can I kiss the actress? No, well, that would just be the
[01:18:58.080 --> 01:19:02.320]   problem with it though, at least for me as a person who watches the soap opera. Oh, you do.
[01:19:03.040 --> 01:19:06.640]   I do. I watch one. I watch Days of Our Life. Have you seen what it looks like? Is it look weird?
[01:19:06.640 --> 01:19:14.160]   So far, no. But I also know that they were like, there hasn't necessarily been a whole lot of
[01:19:14.160 --> 01:19:17.600]   days of our lives that I'm seeing now that they've been shooting in the pandemic.
[01:19:17.600 --> 01:19:23.520]   Because there was a point where they were so far in it, they had like nearly a year's worth of
[01:19:23.520 --> 01:19:28.640]   episodes banked already. And so they let everybody go for two or three months as a cost saving
[01:19:28.640 --> 01:19:32.720]   measure because they weren't filming and they were so far out in advance. So it's very weird
[01:19:33.120 --> 01:19:38.320]   like Days of Our Lives is known for its unrealistic storylines. There was a point where there was
[01:19:38.320 --> 01:19:42.720]   somebody possessed by Satan. There's people they've killed off a half a dozen times who just keep
[01:19:42.720 --> 01:19:50.160]   popping back up like a bad penny. And like, I get that. But the weirdest thing I have ever seen on
[01:19:50.160 --> 01:19:55.520]   Days of Our Lives is what I'm what when I watch it now today and nobody's wearing masks and they
[01:19:55.520 --> 01:20:00.480]   all go sit in the town square and people sit in restaurants that are full and it makes me an easy
[01:20:00.480 --> 01:20:06.160]   each other. And it's weird. Like it feels like I'm old content. It feels like it's science fiction,
[01:20:06.160 --> 01:20:11.600]   but it's a soap opera. You can't do that. Put on your ass. No, every time I'm watching a show,
[01:20:11.600 --> 01:20:17.280]   I will look and see I'll go and I literally look it up. When did they film this? But we're
[01:20:17.280 --> 01:20:21.120]   getting to the point, by the way, we're getting the point where stuff was filmed in March
[01:20:21.120 --> 01:20:27.520]   of last year. And it's we're at the cliff, I think, where you're going to see what's really weird for me
[01:20:27.520 --> 01:20:31.360]   is that I've been watching a ton of stuff because I'm like, I have nothing else to do. I'm sorry,
[01:20:31.360 --> 01:20:36.880]   we're on lockdown with me both. I started watching like the CBS streaming stuff and they have episodes
[01:20:36.880 --> 01:20:41.600]   of NCIS where they have like the New Orleans ones are all wearing their masks, but then they take
[01:20:41.600 --> 01:20:46.720]   them off and the Los Angeles ones where they shouldn't be within a mile of any other human being.
[01:20:46.720 --> 01:20:50.560]   They're not wearing any masks. They talked about it in one episode. They're not wearing any again.
[01:20:50.560 --> 01:20:53.920]   And I'm like, I'm so confused. You're literally making this worse. People are going to see your
[01:20:53.920 --> 01:20:59.520]   haphazard efforts, which is worse than nothing. Please stop. Yeah. And like as is it law and order,
[01:20:59.520 --> 01:21:06.080]   I think is doing something else to like, maybe it's SVU or something, where like they bring the
[01:21:06.080 --> 01:21:10.400]   suspect into the room and then they take off their masks to talk to the person in the tiny
[01:21:10.400 --> 01:21:16.640]   little interrogation room. I'm like, no, no, no, no. What could possibly go wrong? Isn't it funny how
[01:21:16.640 --> 01:21:22.240]   in less than a year we become totally conditioned? Like, where's the mask? I have nightmares where
[01:21:22.240 --> 01:21:26.720]   I'm social. We're social creatures who have gotten immense social anxiety about being near our fellow
[01:21:26.720 --> 01:21:33.200]   people again. Yeah. I'm not. I'm not sure. I have to say this because this is so this is such a
[01:21:33.200 --> 01:21:38.800]   coincidence. Last night, I had a dream. And you know, you ever had those things where the dream
[01:21:38.800 --> 01:21:43.120]   works great until you something is wrong and you realize, Oh, this is just a dream. Okay, we'll ever
[01:21:43.120 --> 01:21:48.400]   have. I had, I had, I had a dream in which I won't go into the details or we're boring, but I realized
[01:21:48.400 --> 01:21:53.040]   that, Oh, wait, I don't have a mask. Wait a minute. There is no chance I would be doing this. Oh, my God.
[01:21:53.040 --> 01:21:57.600]   It must be me. I must be. Yeah. Oh, my God. That happened to me at Disneyland. I dreamt that I was
[01:21:57.600 --> 01:22:03.840]   at Disney and couldn't find a mask and I was terrified. Yeah. My new, my new thing, the new, the new man
[01:22:03.840 --> 01:22:10.960]   spreading. If I were low, it's spreading? No, the new man's spreading is wearing your mask. And you
[01:22:10.960 --> 01:22:16.800]   see it all the time now. And it's mostly guys. Yeah. Like this below the nose. It's like, and they're
[01:22:16.800 --> 01:22:21.840]   mostly politicians. It's politicians. It's almost all men sports. If you watch football at all,
[01:22:21.840 --> 01:22:26.640]   they're all doing this. It's the new somebody said, that's the new man spreading is wearing your
[01:22:26.640 --> 01:22:32.080]   mask below your nose. Yeah. Knock it off. Fauci is now saying, Hey, you know, why not double mask?
[01:22:32.080 --> 01:22:37.280]   That's double masking. A lot of people do know. Yeah. Just just as a flex if nothing else.
[01:22:37.280 --> 01:22:43.600]   Yeah. Looks cool. Look, look who has this, but this much, this much of a stockpile of N95.
[01:22:44.400 --> 01:22:50.320]   Well, this is so this thing is a respirator, which means it it filters the inbound, but it has a
[01:22:50.320 --> 01:22:55.360]   valve for the outbound. So I can't wear this by itself. So I put on my respirator, that's to
[01:22:55.360 --> 01:23:01.440]   protect me. And then I put on my N95 to protect you. And I don't look that weird.
[01:23:01.440 --> 01:23:09.760]   No, no, no, I feel a lot safer. Last February, you might have, but this February, you know,
[01:23:10.480 --> 01:23:13.920]   Lisa and I have been talking about this. We're never, we're always going to wear masks when we
[01:23:13.920 --> 01:23:19.280]   travel from now on wherever we go. I'm not going to stop because the, because maybe we'll, you know,
[01:23:19.280 --> 01:23:23.840]   we'll all get vaccines. We don't have to worry about this, but there's still flues and colds and
[01:23:23.840 --> 01:23:29.840]   all sorts of stuff. If one of the, if one of the long lasting effects of this after the, after the
[01:23:29.840 --> 01:23:35.120]   death is over is that we pick up what's a cultural thing that's been happening to the countries where
[01:23:35.120 --> 01:23:39.200]   wearing a mask is not only protected, but it says, Hi, everyone, I have a cold, please don't get too
[01:23:39.200 --> 01:23:43.600]   close to me. That I think would be very positive. I'm on board. Yeah. Yeah.
[01:23:43.600 --> 01:23:49.200]   Let's take a little break. I want to talk about 14 for there's a lot to say about it. It's coming
[01:23:49.200 --> 01:23:55.600]   out now. But first, a word from our sponsor, actually, a word from the people who bring you
[01:23:55.600 --> 01:24:04.560]   the show, literally, cash fly. It's our CDN, our content distribution network. Cash fly has
[01:24:04.560 --> 01:24:09.680]   been around one of the first CDN since 1999. We know they work because we've been with them
[01:24:09.680 --> 01:24:14.000]   practically since we started. We were, we were having trouble, to be honest,
[01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:22.080]   distributing our shows. You know, when Twit came out, there were 250,000 people downloading it
[01:24:22.080 --> 01:24:26.560]   pretty much all at once. The website couldn't handle the traffic for a while. I tried bit
[01:24:26.560 --> 01:24:30.400]   turning it. I would, I don't know if you remember in the early days, I would beg people, please
[01:24:30.400 --> 01:24:35.760]   see our, see our show so that others can listen. Matt Levine of cash fly came along and he said,
[01:24:35.760 --> 01:24:42.960]   Leo, let me help. And we have never looked back. Cash fly is amazing. So many features,
[01:24:42.960 --> 01:24:48.800]   not just for the podcaster, but for anybody who has content, whether it's apps, streaming audio,
[01:24:48.800 --> 01:24:54.640]   streaming video. In fact, they now offer something I, this is really great called ultra low latency
[01:24:54.640 --> 01:25:01.040]   streaming. This is not web RTC, which may have let you down in the past. This is something unique
[01:25:01.040 --> 01:25:07.280]   from cash fly with stream delays, less than a second, less than a second latency. You could play
[01:25:07.280 --> 01:25:13.760]   anywhere because it's not, it's not flash. It's an HTML5 player with easy support anywhere in it.
[01:25:13.760 --> 01:25:19.200]   There's even an SDK. So you can add mobile support, whatever you need, whether you need your player
[01:25:19.200 --> 01:25:25.920]   to run on websites, applications, mobile devices, they've got you covered. Less than one second
[01:25:25.920 --> 01:25:33.440]   latency is unheard of. We can't do it. The radio station I work for can't do it. Only cash fly.
[01:25:33.440 --> 01:25:38.880]   And by the way, cash fly is totally global. They're the best CDN if you want global throughput,
[01:25:38.880 --> 01:25:43.360]   over 50 points of presence. And you saw that map earlier distributed all over the world. If
[01:25:43.360 --> 01:25:48.800]   you haven't go to their website, you'll see it. So on their low latency network, those video streams,
[01:25:48.800 --> 01:25:55.280]   they'll be streaming quickly, no matter where your viewers are, every continent. It's infinitely
[01:25:55.280 --> 01:26:01.440]   scalable too. So don't worry about being a success. Cash fly's ultra low latency video platform
[01:26:01.440 --> 01:26:06.960]   can deliver video to more than a million users concurrently. It can even ingest thousands of
[01:26:06.960 --> 01:26:12.240]   synchronous streams. And the ingest is reliable. It's designed for transmuxing thousands of streams
[01:26:12.240 --> 01:26:20.800]   simultaneously with live failover, RTMP, RTMPs, SRT and more ultra low latency SLDP and HLS
[01:26:20.800 --> 01:26:25.200]   streams at the same time. I'm sorry, I'm getting a little geeky because I'm so excited. This is so
[01:26:25.200 --> 01:26:32.080]   cool. Get a solution tailored to your needs get a custom built solution. Cash fly will work with
[01:26:32.080 --> 01:26:37.440]   you to understand what you need to help you make it work. And it's all built on top of their reliable,
[01:26:37.440 --> 01:26:43.840]   robust global network with ingest and delivery wherever you need it. The best support ever 24/7
[01:26:43.840 --> 01:26:48.960]   every day of the year. They're always there for you. That's been my experience. We just love
[01:26:48.960 --> 01:26:55.840]   working with cash fly. Amazing. Their infrastructure can support more than a million concurrent streams.
[01:26:55.840 --> 01:27:01.280]   And because of their reliable throughput and scalability, they're five times faster than other
[01:27:01.280 --> 01:27:09.920]   CDNs. And they're the most reliable backed by a 100% SLA. That's not nine's baby. That's
[01:27:09.920 --> 01:27:15.760]   one zero zero. Cash fly also is doing a great job helping others in need. They're working with
[01:27:15.760 --> 01:27:20.400]   World Central Kitchen, one of my favorite organizations. They're feeding people all over the world.
[01:27:20.400 --> 01:27:25.280]   This is a tough time, but cash flies a good corporate citizen. They also, by the way, the
[01:27:25.280 --> 01:27:31.520]   Pioneer, the first any cast CDN infrastructure in 2002. Their best hop technology automatically
[01:27:31.520 --> 01:27:37.040]   finds the fastest route to and from customer origin across their global network of pops.
[01:27:37.040 --> 01:27:44.720]   That gives you maximum performance and reliability. I am a devoted cash fly user. Just for
[01:27:44.720 --> 01:27:48.800]   Twitter listeners, cash flies give any way a complimentary detail analysis of your current CDN
[01:27:48.800 --> 01:27:54.320]   bill and usage trends. No hard sell. No, they're not going to push you. They just want to help you.
[01:27:54.320 --> 01:28:01.040]   So see if you're overpaying 20% or more for your CDN. You'll find out what cash fly can do for
[01:28:01.040 --> 01:28:07.840]   you when you go to twit.cash fly.com. This is really exciting stuff. Very, I know they've been
[01:28:07.840 --> 01:28:14.400]   around since 1999, but that doesn't mean they're not on the leading edge of this technology. Twit.cash fly.com.
[01:28:14.400 --> 01:28:22.400]   They are real innovators. Thank you, cash fly, for making all of our shows possible. Twit.cash fly.com.
[01:28:23.760 --> 01:28:30.400]   So let's talk 14 for one reason you're going to want to upgrade. It is available now for
[01:28:30.400 --> 01:28:39.760]   everything. I think right. iOS, Apple Watch, TVOS, iOS, audio OS, yes, your home pods. You can
[01:28:39.760 --> 01:28:43.760]   upgrade those. I'll tell you in a second what you'll get if you upgrade those because the feature
[01:28:43.760 --> 01:28:49.120]   that I was just talking about has just come out. But let's talk about the most important reason
[01:28:49.120 --> 01:28:56.160]   that you want to do this three active vulnerabilities affecting iPhones and iPads.
[01:28:56.160 --> 01:29:03.840]   I guess that's a zero day there being exploited right now. Of course, Apple is always very close
[01:29:03.840 --> 01:29:07.440]   lived about these security vulnerabilities because they don't want to give the bad guys
[01:29:07.440 --> 01:29:12.240]   any ammunition. So we don't know who's exploiting the vulnerabilities, what the consequences are,
[01:29:13.440 --> 01:29:19.280]   who's been attacked. Apple said nothing about that. In fact, they gave the individual,
[01:29:19.280 --> 01:29:24.240]   this is interesting. They gave the individual who submitted the bug to Apple anonymity,
[01:29:24.240 --> 01:29:30.480]   which makes me think it might have been one of the bad guys who felt so bad about this
[01:29:30.480 --> 01:29:34.560]   that they said, you know what, I'm sure there's a bounty too. Two of the bugs.
[01:29:34.560 --> 01:29:40.240]   It's Samsung. Yeah, maybe or that's the other possibility. Two of the bugs we found in WebKit.
[01:29:41.200 --> 01:29:45.440]   I'm just thinking if it were Google's Project Zero, for instance, no anonymity.
[01:29:45.440 --> 01:29:48.800]   They would have blocked it a week ago. Yeah. So the fact that they're giving
[01:29:48.800 --> 01:29:53.360]   anonymity, I think that's interesting. Two of the bugs are in WebKit. That's of course not only
[01:29:53.360 --> 01:29:58.640]   the Safari browser engine, but any browser you use, anything that renders web pages on your iPhone
[01:29:58.640 --> 01:30:03.760]   or iPad is they're all using WebKit. And the third vulnerabilities in the kernel,
[01:30:04.320 --> 01:30:11.040]   that says bad as it gets. There are apparently chain exploits, which are using different
[01:30:11.040 --> 01:30:16.000]   vulnerabilities. Apple says, we'll give you details, but not yet.
[01:30:16.000 --> 01:30:24.720]   This is, I can't remember a time Apple said actively being exploited. That is as bad as it can get.
[01:30:24.720 --> 01:30:31.680]   So folks, if you, I mean, Apple people are really, you know, often the first to update,
[01:30:31.680 --> 01:30:39.040]   but if you haven't updated yet update now, update now, don't know anything more about it.
[01:30:39.040 --> 01:30:44.240]   There's some speculation about what it could be, but it's all speculation. You know, maybe Steve
[01:30:44.240 --> 01:30:50.480]   Gibson will be talking about that. We do security now next. Okay, that's the bad news. Good news.
[01:30:50.480 --> 01:30:56.080]   Your HomePod mini finally can follow you around. Yay.
[01:30:57.680 --> 01:31:03.280]   So tell me about this, Renee, because you probably have already done it. I'm guessing.
[01:31:03.280 --> 01:31:07.120]   Yeah, no, it's really cool. It's sort of like the first hints we're getting of how Apple's
[01:31:07.120 --> 01:31:12.640]   going to use their spatial positioning technology, like the U1, which can do location, but also data.
[01:31:12.640 --> 01:31:17.520]   And it basically can tell how close you are to your HomePod mini. And as you get closer, it sort of
[01:31:17.520 --> 01:31:23.040]   escalates the share notification that it gives you like this visual tactile feeling of moving,
[01:31:24.400 --> 01:31:29.280]   I was going to say content, but it's audio back and forth between your iPhone and your HomePod,
[01:31:29.280 --> 01:31:34.400]   or suggesting if there's nothing playing right now, suggesting things you might enjoy playing.
[01:31:34.400 --> 01:31:37.040]   Oh, interesting. Do I have to make it a much more visceral experience?
[01:31:37.040 --> 01:31:43.920]   Here's a scenario that they demonstrated at WWDC, or was it later? It was in September when they
[01:31:43.920 --> 01:31:50.240]   announced the mini. Yes. They had that that fake house set up. And the thing is, the thing I'm
[01:31:50.240 --> 01:31:54.320]   imagining and tell me if I can do this, I'm listening to my audiobook in the bedroom.
[01:31:54.320 --> 01:31:57.680]   This is, by the way, I bought the mini. I'm listening to the audiobook in the bedroom,
[01:31:57.680 --> 01:32:02.960]   and I walk out of the bedroom into the kitchen. Does the audiobook automatically transfer,
[01:32:02.960 --> 01:32:05.120]   or do I get a notification and I have to press a button?
[01:32:05.120 --> 01:32:09.200]   So these are different things. What this is doing is it's giving you almost like, it's basically
[01:32:09.200 --> 01:32:13.760]   handoff, but they're trying to make handoff a more tactile experience. So this is literally,
[01:32:13.760 --> 01:32:16.800]   you're playing on your HomePod, but you're going to go out for a walk and you want to continue
[01:32:16.800 --> 01:32:20.640]   listening while you're out for a walk. So you just tap your HomePod or bring it close. You're
[01:32:20.640 --> 01:32:23.840]   not actually going to have to tap it. It'll go to your phone and then you take your phone with you
[01:32:23.840 --> 01:32:29.440]   out. To move it to your kitchen, you would just say, "Yo, Jimbo, move audio to kitchen." And then
[01:32:29.440 --> 01:32:33.360]   your jumbo would happily say, "I'll search the web for that Leo." But then the second time you
[01:32:33.360 --> 01:32:38.480]   actually do it. Didn't they promise that it would do it automatically, or maybe that was my fantasy?
[01:32:38.480 --> 01:32:43.680]   I don't know if they said they'd do it automatically, because there's a bunch of use cases where they
[01:32:43.680 --> 01:32:48.560]   probably wouldn't be sure if that was your intent and they try to do intent-based content distribution.
[01:32:48.560 --> 01:32:54.400]   Because the reason I spread, I've put five of them, to spread them out
[01:32:54.400 --> 01:32:59.200]   throughout the house, so I could do my chores and have the book. You can tell it to put it on
[01:32:59.200 --> 01:33:02.880]   in all five, and you can tell it to follow you. I don't know if it'll follow you without you
[01:33:02.880 --> 01:33:06.240]   giving it permission to. Oh, that's disappointing. I misunderstood, I guess.
[01:33:06.240 --> 01:33:10.720]   All right. All right. I might be. I just think that you've got to tap it or dig. There's got to
[01:33:10.720 --> 01:33:16.720]   always be user intent, otherwise it starts to violate their privacy. Yeah, I guess I understand that.
[01:33:16.720 --> 01:33:22.080]   And do you have to have an iPhone with the UWB chip in it? I guess you will. iPhone 11 or later to
[01:33:22.080 --> 01:33:27.280]   do the fancy version, yeah. Otherwise, you've got to use the interface like an animal.
[01:33:27.280 --> 01:33:33.680]   Apple is also celebrating, and I guess this is part of the updates, the Black History Month,
[01:33:33.680 --> 01:33:38.080]   the shortest month of the year, February coming up. So we decided to give that to Black people.
[01:33:38.800 --> 01:33:49.040]   I'm being sarcastic. This is, they're going to have new content, curated features on the App Store,
[01:33:49.040 --> 01:33:55.360]   Apple Music, Apple TV app, Apple Books, Apple Podcast, new Apple Map Guides, and the Apple Watch
[01:33:55.360 --> 01:33:59.520]   Black Unity Connect Collection. And that's the one you wanted to talk about, Renee. What is that?
[01:33:59.520 --> 01:34:06.240]   That's just it's a Black version of the Apple Watch. It has a special Black History Month
[01:34:07.200 --> 01:34:12.320]   band and Black History Month face. The face, I believe, is going to be widely available today
[01:34:12.320 --> 01:34:17.440]   as part of the update, but you can get this special edition of the Watch itself, which is just fire.
[01:34:17.440 --> 01:34:23.200]   Oh, look at that. This is so nice. I want to buy a new Apple Watch. True Power Solidarity.
[01:34:23.200 --> 01:34:33.120]   And the colors are red, green, and black, which is the color of what flag, the African American
[01:34:33.120 --> 01:34:37.440]   flag. I don't know what that is. But I recognize that I've seen the colors before.
[01:34:37.440 --> 01:34:41.200]   That's beautiful. That is a nice looking watch.
[01:34:41.200 --> 01:34:46.560]   And this comes on the heels of their last week's announcements for the racial equity and justice
[01:34:46.560 --> 01:34:52.720]   fund. So it's not just a step, it is a consistent continuing social initiative at Apple.
[01:34:52.720 --> 01:34:58.080]   It's the Pan-African flag, read for the blood that unites people of the African diaspora
[01:34:58.640 --> 01:35:04.240]   and was shed for their liberation. Black for the people whose existence is affirmed by the flag
[01:35:04.240 --> 01:35:09.600]   and green for the vibrant natural wealth of Africa, the motherland. I'm going to cry.
[01:35:09.600 --> 01:35:15.920]   That is really neat. Apparently, you can't see this in the stills, but the shapes and the colors
[01:35:15.920 --> 01:35:21.840]   shift. Not on the band, obviously, but on the watch face. So I can do the watch face though, right?
[01:35:21.840 --> 01:35:24.960]   I think I believe so. Yeah, I have a couple of them.
[01:35:24.960 --> 01:35:28.800]   Part of the update. You can tap on the arrow. They should show you the other ones.
[01:35:28.800 --> 01:35:37.680]   They're all very nice. Really nice. Oh, look at that. Yeah, that's cool.
[01:35:37.680 --> 01:35:44.480]   It's amazing that that just shows you something about the Apple Watch. You can have a watch band
[01:35:44.480 --> 01:35:49.760]   as an extension of social outreach. That's the cultural significance of this product that
[01:35:49.760 --> 01:35:54.320]   people prefer. Lots of people, including myself, might have been pretty skeptical about a bunch
[01:35:54.320 --> 01:35:59.280]   of years ago. That's amazing. Kelly's showing us her pride. I don't know what you could possibly
[01:35:59.280 --> 01:36:04.480]   be referring to, Andy, aside from the fact that I buy a new watch band from Apple every year,
[01:36:04.480 --> 01:36:11.680]   and it's every June. It's a thing that I like about what they've done with Apple Watch.
[01:36:11.680 --> 01:36:19.520]   And like Renee mentioned with the Reggie Fund stuff, the announcement we got last week was just
[01:36:19.520 --> 01:36:24.960]   a follow-up to what they had said they were doing. We're going to earmark all this money,
[01:36:24.960 --> 01:36:29.120]   and we're going to do something with it. And they did that late last year. And then
[01:36:29.120 --> 01:36:35.440]   last week, we got the announcement of this is what we're doing with it. Here's where it's going.
[01:36:35.440 --> 01:36:38.720]   Here's some folks that are getting it. Here's this other project that part of
[01:36:38.720 --> 01:36:43.920]   it's working on. And it was really interesting to see them lay out the nuts and bolts of that,
[01:36:43.920 --> 01:36:49.200]   the way that they did very matter of fact. We said we were doing this. Here's what we're doing with
[01:36:49.200 --> 01:36:54.400]   it. And it's more than just updating a banner on a website or posting some nice graphic on social
[01:36:54.400 --> 01:36:59.600]   media and calling it good. They're backing it up. And it's nice to see. During Black History Month.
[01:36:59.600 --> 01:37:02.800]   And there's a Jackson and a woman who's leading this at Apple. You can see though,
[01:37:02.800 --> 01:37:07.200]   I don't want to out anybody, but you can see them on Instagram. They are absolute forces of nature.
[01:37:07.200 --> 01:37:12.240]   And I just want to get this watch, put in a pair of AirPods, AirPods, play Shasha Lasha,
[01:37:12.240 --> 01:37:17.120]   and lose the rest of a week for that. During Black History Month, Curator and writer Kimberly
[01:37:17.120 --> 01:37:24.320]   Drew will moderate today at Apple Sessions led by Black creatives, including Trey Seals,
[01:37:24.320 --> 01:37:29.760]   Typographer, Creative Director, Filmmaker, photographer Joshua Kissy, visual artist,
[01:37:29.760 --> 01:37:38.800]   Sean Wallace. Is this part of their initiative or is this just, you know, it's interesting because
[01:37:38.800 --> 01:37:46.080]   it started slow with product red. And it's getting taken up speed. Apple is so
[01:37:46.080 --> 01:37:51.520]   committed to being a good corporate citizen in the world. And I just, I think this is
[01:37:51.520 --> 01:37:58.240]   this is really moving and really great. There's a limited edition watch series six. We talked about
[01:37:58.240 --> 01:38:03.120]   the Black Unity Sport Band. You can get that for your existing watch if you have one. And if you have
[01:38:03.680 --> 01:38:10.160]   the new watch, OS, the Unity watch face, Apple's also supporting SIPs global organizations.
[01:38:10.160 --> 01:38:18.160]   I presume some of the revenue from these sales will go to this, the Black Lives Matter support fund
[01:38:18.160 --> 01:38:24.320]   via the Tides Foundation, the European network against racism, international institute and race
[01:38:24.320 --> 01:38:29.200]   equality and human rights, leadership conference educational fund and NAACP legal defense and
[01:38:29.200 --> 01:38:36.240]   educational funding. Souls grown deep. That's neat. That's across so many Apple properties too.
[01:38:36.240 --> 01:38:40.800]   Like none of them are one off. It's a systematic planned sort of progression across their entire
[01:38:40.800 --> 01:38:44.560]   product line and service line. This is, I really feel like this is Tim Cook and this is from the
[01:38:44.560 --> 01:38:50.160]   heart for Tim. This is, yeah, but I'm sure every employee at Apple is like, yeah, right on, this is
[01:38:50.160 --> 01:38:56.240]   great. Really good. Oh, yeah. If you go to Bustle, they have an article up with the people who are
[01:38:56.240 --> 01:38:59.360]   leading the initiative, which is Lisa Jackson and
[01:38:59.360 --> 01:39:06.160]   Lisa Jackson and Alyssa Johnson. It was the program lead for Apple's
[01:39:06.160 --> 01:39:11.440]   racial equity and justice initiative. And they are just amazing people doing an amazing job.
[01:39:11.440 --> 01:39:16.400]   Lisa Jackson, of course, we saw her on the roof. And then in the basement, she's Apple's vice
[01:39:16.400 --> 01:39:22.480]   president of environmental, environment policy and social initiatives. And of course, the racial
[01:39:22.480 --> 01:39:31.600]   equity and justice initiative is from her, but also, as you mentioned, from Alyssa Johnson.
[01:39:31.600 --> 01:39:36.480]   Alyssa Johnson and the, they're talking about the entire efforts. Yeah. Yeah. It's such a team effort.
[01:39:36.480 --> 01:39:43.200]   And it's a big effort. Like you said, it's across a bunch of different properties and
[01:39:43.200 --> 01:39:48.160]   and a bunch of different facets of Apple that we're finding this from that there's
[01:39:50.080 --> 01:39:54.160]   part of this group and part of this group and part of this group and and having to coordinate
[01:39:54.160 --> 01:40:03.440]   putting all that stuff together. Yeah. Cool. What else in 14 for that we should talk about
[01:40:03.440 --> 01:40:10.000]   anything else? I mean, yeah, yeah, yeah. More indicators of the still unlaunched air tags.
[01:40:10.000 --> 01:40:14.240]   Oh, God. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:40:14.240 --> 01:40:18.560]   Because we're going to some of our exciting things that Apple right now, like trolling everybody,
[01:40:18.560 --> 01:40:22.880]   like, Oh, it's coming. I do like the rumor. And I don't know if I can credit it because we've
[01:40:22.880 --> 01:40:29.600]   heard this over and over again that the next Apple Watch series seven will do blood sugar measurement.
[01:40:29.600 --> 01:40:37.040]   I don't know. Like Apple was really intent on doing it and they invested in it. They bought
[01:40:37.040 --> 01:40:40.480]   so many companies that said they were on the verge of me able to do it. And they were like,
[01:40:40.480 --> 01:40:45.280]   yes, we'll just buy this company. They're like, Oh, it turns out not so close. So it seems like
[01:40:45.280 --> 01:40:49.360]   something that they want to ship as absolutely quickly as possible. But the technological hurdles
[01:40:49.360 --> 01:40:54.160]   are such that Steve Jobs was talking. I think Walt Mossberg and Steve Jobs famously talked about
[01:40:54.160 --> 01:40:59.520]   this feature, which shows how long Apple's been working on it. 10% of Americans have diabetes.
[01:40:59.520 --> 01:41:05.200]   26 million of them are undiagnosed. I have type two diabetes under well under control,
[01:41:05.200 --> 01:41:11.600]   I'm glad to say. But if I didn't know about it, then I probably wouldn't be well under control. So
[01:41:11.600 --> 01:41:15.920]   this is this is not only the right thing to do. It's a great
[01:41:15.920 --> 01:41:22.880]   revenue opportunity. And then there is a race to come up with something to measure blood sugar
[01:41:22.880 --> 01:41:28.640]   without a pin prick or some invasive thing on your on your hip or something.
[01:41:28.640 --> 01:41:34.720]   Yeah, Sam's also has rumors that they're not in the car to do near
[01:41:34.880 --> 01:41:41.200]   nearby. Yeah, it's not it's it's easy to do. It's hard to do in a way that you can actually get
[01:41:41.200 --> 01:41:45.600]   approval to actually say that this is this is useful for the maintenance, a daily maintenance of
[01:41:45.600 --> 01:41:52.240]   diabetes, because you think about the the ECG monitor. It's a very limited sort of thing in
[01:41:52.240 --> 01:41:57.120]   terms of what it how it will affect your life. It will simply say, Oh, we've seen some we've seen
[01:41:57.120 --> 01:42:02.080]   a heart rhythm that seems kind of odd. You might want to and if people ignored it or people didn't
[01:42:02.080 --> 01:42:06.800]   have it, then it doesn't really affect their life. But if somebody says if a watch is telling them,
[01:42:06.800 --> 01:42:10.640]   Nope, your blood sugar is perfectly fine. You're great. You're not crashing or anything. And then
[01:42:10.640 --> 01:42:16.640]   you do have a problem that is a death situation. And so that's this is it's very analogous to the
[01:42:16.640 --> 01:42:21.760]   self driving car situation where it's easy to do it's bad. It's hard to do in a way that you can
[01:42:21.760 --> 01:42:26.000]   actually ship it and it will do exactly what people expected to do in the package.
[01:42:30.320 --> 01:42:35.840]   So again, upgrade as soon as you can, both your iPhone and iPad, and you might as well upgrade
[01:42:35.840 --> 01:42:43.200]   everything else while you're at it's it's upgrade time in the Apple is not great a Palooza. M1 Max
[01:42:43.200 --> 01:42:49.520]   can according to nine to five Mac run a full version of Linux. This is from Corellium, the company
[01:42:49.520 --> 01:42:55.200]   Apple sued because they made an emulator. I guess I gather this is some sort of emulator,
[01:42:56.320 --> 01:43:03.200]   some sort of virtualization solution. So if you've been, you know, even Linus Torvalds
[01:43:03.200 --> 01:43:08.080]   is looking with envy at the M1 processor and saying, boy, I wish you could get Linux to run on that.
[01:43:08.080 --> 01:43:11.680]   I think that it's going to shy about voicing his opinions on the internet.
[01:43:11.680 --> 01:43:19.280]   And I, well, I feel the same way. You know, I'm you're stuck running on Intel. There is
[01:43:19.280 --> 01:43:25.920]   the M1 has really changed the world, even Intel's new CEO, as we mentioned last week.
[01:43:26.640 --> 01:43:35.920]   Is is eyeing Apple? It basically Intel just lost a race like decisively. And they're saying,
[01:43:35.920 --> 01:43:40.560]   we got it. We got to catch up. We get this is and it's notoriously hard, by the way, to do that.
[01:43:40.560 --> 01:43:45.680]   Well, this is a great example of Apple playing the long game. And I'm talking about 10 years,
[01:43:45.680 --> 01:43:51.760]   20 years, sometimes I sometimes complain about how Apple has holds on to certain dogma that is
[01:43:51.760 --> 01:43:55.600]   outdated and holds back the evolution of the product. But one of the dogmas that they have
[01:43:55.600 --> 01:44:01.040]   that's been almost in stay one is that we build everything. We design the hardware. We design the
[01:44:01.040 --> 01:44:06.880]   we design the operating system. We design we do all the APIs for people to write the software for it.
[01:44:06.880 --> 01:44:11.520]   And even extending towards now we design the silicon for it. The sort of the sort of
[01:44:11.520 --> 01:44:16.000]   performance they're getting out of the M1 is the payoff of 20 years of saying, you don't know,
[01:44:16.000 --> 01:44:20.960]   you don't get to buy any sort of piece of hardware that runs Mac OS that you want. Because if that
[01:44:20.960 --> 01:44:25.920]   were to happen, we wouldn't be able to pull off something like this M1 transition so easily and
[01:44:25.920 --> 01:44:30.800]   also make it run so well. It on the on the window side of things, they are doing they do have an
[01:44:30.800 --> 01:44:35.600]   arm version of Windows. It doesn't work really all that well, because that has to work on every
[01:44:35.600 --> 01:44:40.480]   single platform. They have a reference hardware designs to run it on, but they can't really
[01:44:40.480 --> 01:44:45.680]   influence every single hardware manufacturer to build a design that says comprehensive as what
[01:44:45.680 --> 01:44:49.840]   Apple's got. So that's, again, that's why every time I talk about dog, there's a good side,
[01:44:49.840 --> 01:44:52.800]   there's a bad side, but this is definitely one of the good sides of Apple Dogma.
[01:44:52.800 --> 01:44:58.160]   I always been a Windows problem. There was lowest common denominator. I mean, like,
[01:44:58.160 --> 01:45:02.240]   always having to run on that. And then, well, it's a thing that they've all.
[01:45:02.240 --> 01:45:04.720]   Service laws are on. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm in
[01:45:04.720 --> 01:45:10.240]   winter. I'm sorry. Go ahead. It's what they've always had to contend with because HP makes one
[01:45:10.240 --> 01:45:14.160]   Toshiba makes one Samsung makes one IBM makes one Dell makes one it's that it's that it's that it's
[01:45:14.160 --> 01:45:15.120]   that it's that it's that it's that it's that it's that it's that it's that it's that it's that it.
[01:45:15.120 --> 01:45:19.360]   And then each one of them gets to put their own windows flavor on it. So like you get a
[01:45:19.360 --> 01:45:23.760]   slightly different experience on a Toshiba laptop than you do on a Samsung,
[01:45:23.760 --> 01:45:30.320]   than you do on a Dell all the way down the line. So like that's always been one of the frustrations
[01:45:30.320 --> 01:45:34.800]   of trying particularly trying to troubleshoot anything on Windows. Like as an IT person,
[01:45:34.800 --> 01:45:39.760]   that's one thing that's really hard is what version do you have? What driver is it using?
[01:45:39.760 --> 01:45:45.600]   You know, even if it's the same hardware in all of those devices, like all of the fine tuning of
[01:45:45.600 --> 01:45:50.480]   all of that is a real thing in the neck to try and sort out. But it's also the strength of the
[01:45:50.480 --> 01:45:54.320]   Windows ecosystem. You can get anything on any kind of hardware you want. You want to touch
[01:45:54.320 --> 01:45:57.440]   screen? We could do that. You don't want to touch screen. We don't have to do that. You want to
[01:45:57.440 --> 01:46:01.600]   that's the good and the bad. Like you can run windows on anything. But you can run windows on
[01:46:01.600 --> 01:46:08.400]   anything. Yeah. But that's the only reason why you can't use Windows XP in 2021. Yeah.
[01:46:08.400 --> 01:46:13.120]   But that was the only reason why I reacted against lowest common denominator. That's often you
[01:46:13.120 --> 01:46:18.160]   that's often used not as a as a as a as a preservative as opposed to just like saying,
[01:46:18.160 --> 01:46:22.320]   well, this this is colored red, which is good. If it's a fire engine, bad. If it's a bad. If
[01:46:22.320 --> 01:46:27.920]   it's a dressy or wearing it, someone else's wedding. So lowest common basically, I would have loved
[01:46:27.920 --> 01:46:32.000]   if like if there are a lot of things I would hate if Apple were run like the Windows,
[01:46:32.000 --> 01:46:38.320]   the Windows ecosystem. But the ability to say, wow, this new laptop that Apple that Apple's
[01:46:38.320 --> 01:46:42.720]   come out with, I don't like the keyboard. I don't like the ports. Well, then I'll buy something
[01:46:42.720 --> 01:46:45.920]   that's kind of like it, but has a much better. Yeah, you can't do that. It is great. Yeah.
[01:46:45.920 --> 01:46:49.440]   So that's all. You can in the Windows. I'm glad that both philosophies are there. Yeah.
[01:46:49.440 --> 01:46:56.160]   Honestly, I wish I could get an M1 on a Lenovo. I mean, I would be thrilled. Yeah.
[01:46:56.160 --> 01:47:01.760]   It could happen. And what did you just do? You you took a video cable and you plugged it
[01:47:01.760 --> 01:47:06.320]   into the computer. Wait, that's not possible. I think that's not possible.
[01:47:07.600 --> 01:47:15.200]   Yeah, where's your dongle? You did see it's brand new. If you saw, if you saw the, if you watched
[01:47:15.200 --> 01:47:23.840]   the wonderful football games on Sunday, you probably saw this ad from Microsoft. It's a touting
[01:47:23.840 --> 01:47:31.520]   the MacBook Pro versus the Surface. Surface got touchscreen much, Mac just because there's a
[01:47:31.520 --> 01:47:40.000]   little tiny touch bar. It's so clear that like they need to, they don't compete with the Mac,
[01:47:40.000 --> 01:47:44.320]   like not really because it's a huge hassle to switch operating systems and ecosystems.
[01:47:44.320 --> 01:47:48.640]   They compete with other Windows machines because they're trying to show how to do really good
[01:47:48.640 --> 01:47:52.880]   Windows machines, but they can't say that because they have a massive OEM ecosystem.
[01:47:52.880 --> 01:47:56.400]   So we're left with these awkward. Don't worry guys, we're not competing with you. We'll show
[01:47:56.400 --> 01:48:00.960]   you because we'll make an ad showing how much we're not like a Mac instead. And it hurts,
[01:48:00.960 --> 01:48:05.040]   it just, it hurts me every time I walk. The funniest thing to me is that it looks like they got a
[01:48:05.040 --> 01:48:09.760]   younger Mark has Brownlee to host it like they're really going after. This is like the
[01:48:09.760 --> 01:48:16.320]   YouTube product review video that they did. You know, some, some kid showing the tooth together,
[01:48:16.320 --> 01:48:20.240]   they're really going after that YouTube crowd with this one. That fellow kids vibe.
[01:48:20.240 --> 01:48:26.080]   Fellow kids. Hey guys, I thought he'd say, mash the bell, mash the button when you hit the end of it.
[01:48:26.960 --> 01:48:30.080]   Like and subscribe surface pro. Yep. It's kind of funny because
[01:48:30.080 --> 01:48:34.720]   according to rumors, Apple actually is thinking about dumping the touch bar. So
[01:48:34.720 --> 01:48:37.600]   maybe they're hitting them while they can't, they still can.
[01:48:37.600 --> 01:48:43.360]   Well, they made, they started doing surface like, and I've talked to a bunch of people
[01:48:43.360 --> 01:48:47.280]   about this because it's always been this way where they felt like they've had to target Apple
[01:48:47.280 --> 01:48:50.560]   just to make the OEMs feel better. And they tried it with the iPod and people were like,
[01:48:50.560 --> 01:48:54.080]   yeah, you're not really an iPad. And then they're trying it with the Mac and they're like,
[01:48:54.080 --> 01:48:58.400]   yeah, but you're not really a map. Why don't you make a commercial showing how much better you
[01:48:58.400 --> 01:49:03.600]   are than just a computer? Like have someone go into an airplane, flip it up to watch a movie,
[01:49:03.600 --> 01:49:07.360]   flip it down to do some work, flip it around to do something like show me why the surface is so
[01:49:07.360 --> 01:49:10.960]   great. But they're stuck in this. We got to, we got to pretend we're aiming at Apple customers.
[01:49:10.960 --> 01:49:14.720]   So people don't get mad at us. And somebody who's in the market for any kind of soft,
[01:49:14.720 --> 01:49:21.200]   like full on laptop is not necessarily going to be in the market for a surface. Like, you know,
[01:49:21.920 --> 01:49:26.960]   like you were saying, like the difference between a Dell laptop and a surface machine
[01:49:26.960 --> 01:49:35.040]   is going to be this is going to be a very similar decision tree as to a MacBook Air or a MacBook
[01:49:35.040 --> 01:49:39.760]   Pro versus a Surface machine. Like, what are the pieces of that that you need in order for it to
[01:49:39.760 --> 01:49:44.400]   be the thing that fits into your life? Because I know a lot of people who upgraded from a really
[01:49:44.400 --> 01:49:49.200]   old laptop, whether it was a Mac or a Windows machine to an iPad and went to that instead and
[01:49:49.200 --> 01:49:55.760]   are very happy. So like, it's hard to, it's hard to figure out who it is they're trying to go up
[01:49:55.760 --> 01:50:02.160]   against there. Like, we have this orange and it's not this Apple. I mean, you know, it doesn't
[01:50:02.160 --> 01:50:07.440]   hold water. If you, I always feel bad when I watch videos like the Will It Blend where they take
[01:50:07.440 --> 01:50:12.720]   perfectly good gear and they put it in a blender and destroy it. I have kind of the same feeling
[01:50:12.720 --> 01:50:17.600]   about this. The president, President Trump, when he was leaving office, filed his final
[01:50:18.720 --> 01:50:26.000]   disclosure forms, 37 pages of gifts that the president received during office. And one of them
[01:50:26.000 --> 01:50:34.960]   was a leather bomber jacket from Ford. No, no, no, a customized golf club from Boeing. No, no,
[01:50:34.960 --> 01:50:40.800]   not that. Oh, Tim Cook, CEO Apple gave him a Mac Pro computer, the first created at the Flex
[01:50:40.800 --> 01:50:45.520]   Factory in Austin, Texas. He didn't give him the high end one though. It's only $6,000. It's a base
[01:50:45.520 --> 01:50:49.840]   model. I don't see an XDR display. Have you seen his YouTube video?
[01:50:49.840 --> 01:50:55.360]   All it has to do is tweet and now it doesn't have to do. I really wonder though, what happened
[01:50:55.360 --> 01:51:01.600]   to that? Like, you know, obviously the president didn't use it. Jared's told that so fast. Jared
[01:51:01.600 --> 01:51:08.240]   has it probably. Yeah. Yeah. There was actually there was a former Apple engineer talked about how
[01:51:09.120 --> 01:51:16.240]   comparing contrast he personally was involved in Steve Jobs, gifting a MacBook Air to, I think,
[01:51:16.240 --> 01:51:20.560]   it was Obama. Yes. And it came back one week later because no, this is too expensive. We can't
[01:51:20.560 --> 01:51:27.600]   accept this as a gift. Yeah. Well, it actually pales in comparison to the bronze statute
[01:51:27.600 --> 01:51:32.880]   depicting flag raising over Iwo Jima, which is valued at $26,000. So,
[01:51:34.960 --> 01:51:40.960]   yeah. He turned into a juice dispenser. Yeah, I don't know. Maybe it's all in the
[01:51:40.960 --> 01:51:44.880]   logo. I don't know. I'm a Coke bubbler into the flag part of it. I don't know.
[01:51:44.880 --> 01:51:50.400]   It's being used as a cocktail table. They have the very best of Kentucky. If I take a McDonald's
[01:51:50.400 --> 01:51:58.960]   and beer on it. All right. Let's, I'll tell you what, I think, I'm gonna make sure I didn't miss
[01:51:58.960 --> 01:52:04.240]   anything. I think we got everything. There's there's an interactive Valentine's Day gift guide.
[01:52:04.240 --> 01:52:11.120]   If you want to get a little head start on that, Mr. Guimant, don't forget, February 14th.
[01:52:11.120 --> 01:52:18.480]   I think that I think that pretty much does it. Let's get ready for our picks of the week. You ready?
[01:52:18.480 --> 01:52:26.240]   I think we have to start for Pixar the week with our guest today. Ladies first,
[01:52:27.040 --> 01:52:35.840]   Kelly Guimant, your pick of the week. So, my pick is actually it's my friend and colleagues podcast
[01:52:35.840 --> 01:52:41.600]   over at Mac Observer. Charlotte Henry, who has written a book about being skeptical about media.
[01:52:41.600 --> 01:52:49.360]   It's called Not Buying It. She is, I like to call her the senior UK correspondent. And she has
[01:52:49.360 --> 01:52:52.960]   started this show called Media Plus. She's been a media person for a long time. I'm gonna subscribe
[01:52:52.960 --> 01:52:59.200]   to this. So, her whole deal is just talking about Apple as a media company, which not a lot of
[01:52:59.200 --> 01:53:05.840]   people are doing. And she's coming from the intersection of like the longtime Apple watchers,
[01:53:05.840 --> 01:53:11.840]   like Dave Hamilton and Brian Chaffin and myself, you know, like we, you know, we're the folks at
[01:53:11.840 --> 01:53:17.120]   Mac Observer. So she comes at it from that perspective, but looking at Apple as a media company and less
[01:53:17.120 --> 01:53:24.400]   about, you know, the other business side of what Apple's doing, but like how does their streaming
[01:53:24.400 --> 01:53:29.920]   stuff compete? And how do, how are they doing against some of these other places? And how does
[01:53:29.920 --> 01:53:34.240]   their content stack up if they don't have a library? And just talking about Apple in terms of being
[01:53:34.240 --> 01:53:39.920]   media, as opposed to other things. Full disclosure, she's had me on as a guest. That is not why I'm
[01:53:39.920 --> 01:53:44.000]   recommending it. You can skip my episodes and have a really great time listening to her talk to other
[01:53:44.000 --> 01:53:49.840]   people. I don't remember who she was recording with, but she's got some some real interesting
[01:53:49.840 --> 01:53:57.840]   folks that she's spoken with about Apple as media, as opposed to Apple as tech. And so, it's very
[01:53:57.840 --> 01:54:01.920]   interesting and she's just getting started. And so I'm picking it so that she gets some attention
[01:54:01.920 --> 01:54:05.360]   because it's a really interesting idea. And I'm not hearing it from a lot of other people.
[01:54:05.360 --> 01:54:12.240]   You can find it at MacObserver.com or just search for media plus on your podcast program. This looks
[01:54:12.240 --> 01:54:16.960]   really good. I will absolutely subscribe. She's got some really interesting people
[01:54:16.960 --> 01:54:23.760]   New York Times, Ben Smith is on to talk about Apple's place in the streaming market. I think
[01:54:23.760 --> 01:54:29.600]   that's fascinating. Zoe Kleinman from BBC. So this really, I think this needs to be done.
[01:54:29.600 --> 01:54:35.360]   It's nice. That's looks great. Thank you for the recommendation, Kelly. And thank you for
[01:54:35.360 --> 01:54:38.000]   recommending something that didn't cost me anything because you know, Lori Gill just
[01:54:40.080 --> 01:54:43.840]   I swear. Renee Richie, your Vig of the Week.
[01:54:43.840 --> 01:54:49.520]   So I'm going to do my best to once again represent Alex Lindsey in absentia. He's going to be here
[01:54:49.520 --> 01:54:57.120]   next week. So so you can just deal his thunder today. Yeah. So a while back, he recommended the
[01:54:57.120 --> 01:55:02.160]   ATEM Mini, which is a product by Blackmagic. It's a it's a very, I'm going to say low,
[01:55:02.160 --> 01:55:08.960]   low Alex priced. Oh, I loved it. I have it. I have it. Yeah. So it's so good. And now they have an ATEM
[01:55:08.960 --> 01:55:14.160]   Mini ISO. So they made an eight of many than an eight to mini pro. And now they have an ATEM Mini
[01:55:14.160 --> 01:55:19.840]   ISO and the ISO lets you do local recording on it. So if you were example, wanted to film a video
[01:55:19.840 --> 01:55:24.320]   in real time, you didn't want to have to shoot multiple cameras, get all that footage, make a,
[01:55:24.320 --> 01:55:29.840]   you know, a compound clip or a multi cam clip in final cut, go through and cut all the angles,
[01:55:29.840 --> 01:55:33.360]   but you're a streamer, you know, maybe you're a game streamer, maybe just a regular streamer,
[01:55:33.360 --> 01:55:37.920]   or you just prefer recording live and doing your own switching, like back in the video toaster
[01:55:38.640 --> 01:55:43.840]   days, you can, you can use this and not have to worry even about recording all the different cameras,
[01:55:43.840 --> 01:55:49.120]   but you can just record on the ISO. And I haven't set up to a quick top down camera,
[01:55:49.120 --> 01:55:53.520]   which right now is focusing on my microphone, not on my computer, but that's fine. I'll fix that.
[01:55:53.520 --> 01:55:56.800]   So you could quickly, as you're talking, just switch the different, but they're all recording.
[01:55:56.800 --> 01:56:03.680]   You have all four cameras recording simultaneously. So you can re edit at any point. That's really cool.
[01:56:03.680 --> 01:56:07.680]   Yeah. And I don't use it for that. I just use it for switching angles while I stream. I obviously
[01:56:07.680 --> 01:56:11.760]   have to go to manual focus. I'm going to have too many things and too many different layers,
[01:56:11.760 --> 01:56:17.200]   but I was watching some people do it. And justine did a stream where she was live editing final cut
[01:56:17.200 --> 01:56:23.040]   pro with like a camera on her keyboard, a camera over on her camera on the on the TV screen,
[01:56:23.040 --> 01:56:27.120]   and you could show them all at the same time, or you could you could show them separately.
[01:56:27.120 --> 01:56:31.520]   And I see a bunch of people, you POSSVOCS has done a really good job at showing these things off too.
[01:56:31.520 --> 01:56:37.120]   But I just like the idea of being able to sit here and switch these. It's not CrayonCam 3000
[01:56:37.120 --> 01:56:42.320]   quality yet. I'm still working on it. And this is the most expensive of them. You can start with,
[01:56:42.320 --> 01:56:46.720]   I think it's 300 bucks for the regular AT&T Mini, but depending on what your needs are,
[01:56:46.720 --> 01:56:52.880]   I love that Blackmagic has like the 4K pocket cam, but also the 12K or so many. You know,
[01:56:52.880 --> 01:56:58.560]   they seem to be really scaling everything from really, really consumer end to prosumer end now,
[01:56:58.560 --> 01:57:02.080]   and you can scale up to sort of or down to meet your needs.
[01:57:02.080 --> 01:57:07.840]   This looks really cool. It automatically creates a DaVinci project file. So you can do it in DaVinci.
[01:57:07.840 --> 01:57:13.440]   Wow, it records to USB disks. Obviously, you're going to have a lot of file storage if you're
[01:57:13.440 --> 01:57:17.520]   recording up to five different inputs simultaneously. But what?
[01:57:17.520 --> 01:57:22.000]   And DaVinci's gotten really good. And it's free. Like the normal version is free and the expensive
[01:57:22.000 --> 01:57:26.080]   version doesn't have that many things at a non-studio customer want anyway.
[01:57:26.080 --> 01:57:31.360]   It looks like it does everything that the AT&T Mini does, but adds that's that.
[01:57:31.360 --> 01:57:37.520]   Which means it has to have a much faster processor because recording all those streams.
[01:57:37.520 --> 01:57:42.000]   Wow, that's really cool. You can even show them all simultaneously. So if you wanted to have,
[01:57:42.000 --> 01:57:47.440]   you know, stream of five, all five cameras and then later do a cut down. Really?
[01:57:47.440 --> 01:57:52.320]   And you can have all your, you can have all your, like, what you don't see, but I see is I have
[01:57:52.320 --> 01:57:56.960]   my two front cameras, my down camera, I have my audio volumes, my stop start, my up next.
[01:57:56.960 --> 01:57:59.760]   You know, like it's, it's really sophisticated.
[01:57:59.760 --> 01:58:06.160]   Wow. Unfortunately, it is also really expensive. You said 12 hundred Canadian.
[01:58:06.160 --> 01:58:14.240]   Yeah, right. I got a, I'm so very tempted. Let me just see how much this costs in American
[01:58:14.240 --> 01:58:17.840]   in real, in real money. Oh, it's not as bad as it is in Canadian money.
[01:58:17.840 --> 01:58:24.640]   Okay. It's 895. Yeah. And again, the entry level one is like, I think 200, 300 bucks.
[01:58:24.640 --> 01:58:29.680]   And then the X-Text one up is 600. So you start to 300, goes to 600. If you want built in streaming,
[01:58:29.680 --> 01:58:35.840]   and then it goes to 900 a few. And I was watching some people also, they take their iPhone,
[01:58:35.840 --> 01:58:39.760]   use the HDMI out, plug that in as one of the sources and they can use that as a live cam.
[01:58:39.760 --> 01:58:44.240]   It works with some Android phones. A pixel doesn't work. I think the Galaxy phones do work.
[01:58:44.240 --> 01:58:48.560]   So depending on whether your phone has HDMI out or not, you can use that as sort of a moving,
[01:58:48.560 --> 01:58:52.880]   a moving, rolling cam, you can switch back and forth. If you want to show your setup or something,
[01:58:52.880 --> 01:58:59.840]   it's really cool stuff. Burke is building me a, I got a Pelican case, a little small Pelican case.
[01:58:59.840 --> 01:59:04.640]   We found something on YouTube will show it when it's done, but he's building me a Pelican case with
[01:59:04.640 --> 01:59:09.040]   the ATEM Mini in it, a display, all the power supplies, everything. So you just put it all in the case,
[01:59:09.040 --> 01:59:13.520]   you carry it around and out. Oh, did you? No, I can shoot. So a good friend of mine, Dave Whiskis.
[01:59:13.520 --> 01:59:17.600]   You might remember him from the Vesper app with John Gruber and Brent. He put up a video today
[01:59:17.600 --> 01:59:22.160]   where he has wired a complete Pelican case to charge three cameras, all the lights, all the gear,
[01:59:22.160 --> 01:59:31.360]   he just plugs the case in and I'm not in any way. Yeah, very cool. Andy and I co pick of the way.
[01:59:31.360 --> 01:59:37.280]   Leo, I'm here to make you feel good because I myself got Leo'd this month.
[01:59:38.400 --> 01:59:45.200]   Okay, so very, very sad news. Mira Furlan passed away last week who was amazing actress from
[01:59:45.200 --> 01:59:51.920]   Yugoslavia. If you had what Fanna lost, she was on lost. I got to newer on the Babylon 5 series
[01:59:51.920 --> 01:59:58.240]   from the 1990s and it reminded me of how much I loved Babylon 5, how hard it was to really see it.
[01:59:58.240 --> 02:00:05.280]   I decided that, oh man, I really want to revisit this. And so I went on and I got like the complete
[02:00:05.280 --> 02:00:11.920]   five season set on DVD, a cajillion DVDs, which I started. I just finished
[02:00:11.920 --> 02:00:16.480]   trans ripping and transcoding volume one. I've got four more to go. And this is a high,
[02:00:16.480 --> 02:00:20.640]   high recommendation to two recommendations here, one for Babylon 5, because this is,
[02:00:20.640 --> 02:00:26.400]   it's not a franchise. It was it was bought and launched by a brand new network, a WB like
[02:00:26.400 --> 02:00:31.200]   the syndication network. So it's not like it got bought by Disney and or got bought by any other
[02:00:31.200 --> 02:00:36.800]   company that then realized what incredible great thing that they had and they continued to promote
[02:00:36.800 --> 02:00:41.920]   it just sort of like sat there. Even though this is one of the greatest, greatest television
[02:00:41.920 --> 02:00:48.320]   that's ever been made. If you've been burned by Game of Thrones and other series, where or lost,
[02:00:48.320 --> 02:00:53.120]   where they started out really hot, but then like they kind of forgot what they were doing and they
[02:00:53.120 --> 02:00:58.800]   really weren't going anywhere with it. The great thing about Babylon 5 was that almost every episode
[02:00:58.800 --> 02:01:02.800]   except for two or three were written by J. Michael Struzinski, the series creator.
[02:01:02.800 --> 02:01:10.320]   And Joe Struzinski, he wrote the entire series, all five seasons in advance. Like all the story
[02:01:10.320 --> 02:01:14.800]   lines were written. I have a character in all their character arcs were written before they filmed
[02:01:14.800 --> 02:01:20.080]   a single episode. They knew he knew exactly what the last episode was going to be and what they
[02:01:20.080 --> 02:01:25.520]   were moving towards. So it's it's the sort of thing where it'll, as a result, it takes a little
[02:01:25.520 --> 02:01:29.840]   while to get off the runway because he knows where things are going. So we'll spend the first 12
[02:01:29.840 --> 02:01:34.880]   episodes sort of laying things down and actually kind of what got me was I remember seeing the first
[02:01:34.880 --> 02:01:40.240]   episode when it was first aired and thinking, Oh, well, this is just another time to do a version
[02:01:40.240 --> 02:01:45.840]   of Star Trek. But no, it turns and then around the season to realize that no, he was suckering me in
[02:01:45.840 --> 02:01:49.920]   and trying to make me knew that I'd be familiar with Star Trek. And he was just screwing with me
[02:01:49.920 --> 02:01:54.560]   to make sure that all of my expectations would be turned on their head. It was one most satisfying
[02:01:54.560 --> 02:01:59.760]   TV experiences I've ever had. So again, high recommendation for that. Now the the the getting
[02:01:59.760 --> 02:02:04.320]   Leo part is that I actually was so excited that I didn't even like bothered to cheapskate my way
[02:02:04.320 --> 02:02:09.760]   out and find a used copy on eBay. I actually like bought it for new for 70 bucks. And a
[02:02:09.760 --> 02:02:16.240]   little a week later, turns out that they've remastered the entire series and now it's available on
[02:02:16.240 --> 02:02:22.960]   if you got HBO Max, you can stream it for free. It's also available. Good news on iTunes and Amazon.
[02:02:22.960 --> 02:02:27.760]   It was a tricky thing because they did they did shoot it in 35 millimeter. However, the special
[02:02:27.760 --> 02:02:33.840]   effects which were digital cut special effects, absolutely cutting edge for the day. They didn't
[02:02:33.840 --> 02:02:39.840]   4k video to the back. Yeah, they were done on a video. So they did a combination of like upscaling
[02:02:39.840 --> 02:02:45.200]   it and then downscaling it back to HD. But I'm I'm okay because they haven't released it. They
[02:02:45.200 --> 02:02:49.120]   haven't announced a Blu ray release date unless I can get my physical hands on physical media.
[02:02:49.120 --> 02:02:54.400]   I'm okay. But but again, at least Babylon 5. It's the same thing that I thought last week is that
[02:02:54.400 --> 02:03:00.000]   I do not want to be I don't want to be reliant on some other company servers for my access to
[02:03:00.000 --> 02:03:04.080]   one of my favorite science fiction shows of all time. So I'm I did get Leo, but I'm very,
[02:03:04.080 --> 02:03:08.560]   very happy to have been Leo and I happen to be excited about being going to watch it for free on
[02:03:08.560 --> 02:03:15.200]   HBO Max. So it works out everywhere. She was the mini bar and not mini bar. I'm sorry.
[02:03:15.200 --> 02:03:23.200]   And Barry, by the way, there's a reason I said mini bar. It actually is named after an Islamic
[02:03:23.200 --> 02:03:27.040]   altar that is sometimes called the mini bar because it looks like a mini bar. So she's the
[02:03:27.040 --> 02:03:31.680]   Min Barry ambassador that she had in her head. She had my favorite line in the show where she
[02:03:31.680 --> 02:03:35.760]   said there's only one earth captain who survived encounter with my Barry fleet. He is behind me.
[02:03:35.760 --> 02:03:42.000]   You are in front of me. If you value your lives, be somewhere else. I'm ashamed to say I haven't
[02:03:42.000 --> 02:03:45.600]   watched it. So I guess I have something to look for. So good. Yeah. Very.
[02:03:45.600 --> 02:03:49.680]   It was I will just button this. I'm sorry. I have to button this up by mentioning that
[02:03:49.680 --> 02:03:56.320]   she had to leave the former Yugoslavia because she was one of the most most important movie stars
[02:03:56.320 --> 02:04:02.480]   and stage actresses of the of the culture. And then things started to go very, very south. And
[02:04:02.480 --> 02:04:08.560]   she was named like a traitor to the country and and of people were being sort of incited to. Oh,
[02:04:08.560 --> 02:04:13.360]   by the way, if she we the government don't like her very much. If you want to hassle her or hurt
[02:04:13.360 --> 02:04:21.600]   her by all means go ahead and do so. Do it. So she had to flee to America. And Jay Maclachersensky
[02:04:21.600 --> 02:04:26.560]   knew of her story. And so a lot of that you could tell oftentimes that she would write a scene for
[02:04:26.560 --> 02:04:33.120]   Mirafurlan that basically comes down to my people have broken apart. My people have degenerated. I
[02:04:33.120 --> 02:04:38.240]   don't recognize the city that I least love so much. And you could just see the it was hard
[02:04:38.240 --> 02:04:42.560]   it's heartbreaking when you first see it as a kid. And then when you see it on DVD later on,
[02:04:42.560 --> 02:04:46.400]   like, Oh my God, like that's I know I know what the story is like. Oh my God, she's
[02:04:46.400 --> 02:04:48.320]   anyway, it's awesome.
[02:04:48.320 --> 02:04:51.920]   Chrissy Heinz said it better and my city is gone. But okay. Okay. Yes.
[02:04:51.920 --> 02:04:57.680]   Thank you so much. Well, Kelly Greenmont for joining us. It's great to have you from the
[02:04:57.680 --> 02:05:04.880]   Mac Observer podcast, TMO Daily from Westworld Rewind. She's on the Twitter at Verso VRS.
[02:05:05.760 --> 02:05:07.680]   Oh, anything else you'd like to plug, Kelly?
[02:05:07.680 --> 02:05:14.400]   I don't think so. I think you can occasionally find me over on the incomparable network,
[02:05:14.400 --> 02:05:18.160]   usually talking about Star Wars, but doing other stuff too.
[02:05:18.160 --> 02:05:22.320]   Thank you so much for being here. We'll have you back soon. I apologize for not having you on
[02:05:22.320 --> 02:05:27.520]   it so long. It's great to have you and your life is. Can I promise? I promise not to cost you
[02:05:27.520 --> 02:05:32.400]   any money with my pick next time when you have me back sooner? No, you can cost me money. I didn't
[02:05:32.400 --> 02:05:38.560]   kick off Lori Gill for the longest time. Or Alex. Or Alex. Yeah, he cost me the most money.
[02:05:38.560 --> 02:05:42.480]   He'll be, by the way, our guest next week in the Rotate.
[02:05:42.480 --> 02:05:47.840]   I don't see hydro wallets. Andy Inacos on WGBH in Boston Friday this week.
[02:05:47.840 --> 02:05:52.960]   It was as of an hour ago, it was going to be Friday. I just got an email saying that the
[02:05:52.960 --> 02:05:57.120]   attorney general, Maura Healy wants some time. Oh, boy. So I'm sure. So I'm sure on Friday,
[02:05:57.120 --> 02:06:01.680]   you'll be able to hear what she has to think about the shakeups and the executive officers at Apple.
[02:06:02.320 --> 02:06:09.200]   But I will be there next week. I'm a usual slut at 1pm on Friday. That's our lives as tech guys,
[02:06:09.200 --> 02:06:14.720]   right, Andy? We're always bumpable, supremely bumpable. Anyone who has police powers,
[02:06:14.720 --> 02:06:18.560]   okay, if she wants, if she's asking for something, you give it to her. You give it to her.
[02:06:18.560 --> 02:06:22.080]   I can't remember. I flew all the way to New York to do today's show.
[02:06:22.080 --> 02:06:28.080]   And I can't remember what it was that they bumped before. It wasn't obviously, it wasn't memorable.
[02:06:29.120 --> 02:06:35.360]   And then kind of as a runner up prize, they said, well, let's do your segment after the
[02:06:35.360 --> 02:06:39.360]   show's over. Maybe we'll use it sometime. And they never did. So that was a lot of fun.
[02:06:39.360 --> 02:06:44.480]   Yeah. All of 2019, I would drive to studios downtown and get all set up for TV hits and
[02:06:44.480 --> 02:06:48.720]   they go, Oh, sorry, the president tweeted. Yeah, I'm going to stop tweeting. Man, got to stop
[02:06:48.720 --> 02:06:55.200]   tweet one and tweet no more. Thank you, Renee Richie, the eponymous Renee Richie channels at
[02:06:55.200 --> 02:07:01.280]   youtube.com/Renee Richie. He does a wonderful Apple Talk podcast with our good friend,
[02:07:01.280 --> 02:07:05.040]   Georgia Dow. Anything else you want to plug anything new in your life?
[02:07:05.040 --> 02:07:11.200]   I did a big overview of Apple's executive changes over the last 10 years that went up on YouTube
[02:07:11.200 --> 02:07:16.880]   today. And yesterday, I tried to explain why Apple is going back on the Mac and the sort of the way
[02:07:16.880 --> 02:07:22.640]   they think about making changes and the difference demands of trying to appeal to consumer market.
[02:07:22.640 --> 02:07:25.840]   But sometimes forgetting you have a very loyal base of customers behind you.
[02:07:25.840 --> 02:07:30.640]   Nice. Well, it's great to have all three of you. Thank you all for joining us. We do Mac
[02:07:30.640 --> 02:07:36.160]   Break Weekly Tuesday mornings 11 a.m. Pacific. That's afternoon in the East Coast, 2 p.m. Eastern
[02:07:36.160 --> 02:07:41.360]   time. 1800 UTC. The reason I mentioned those times you can watch us do it live.
[02:07:41.360 --> 02:07:48.800]   And so behind the scenes kind of thing, our live audio and video streams are at twit.tv/live.
[02:07:48.800 --> 02:07:55.680]   If you're watching live chat live at irc.twit.tv, a great community run chat room that is so much
[02:07:55.680 --> 02:08:01.200]   fun to be in. And there's often a great asset to us on the show. Scooter X is feeding me links.
[02:08:01.200 --> 02:08:07.200]   I got the Scooter X News feed. We also make all the shows available for download. Of course,
[02:08:07.200 --> 02:08:15.360]   that's what it means to be a podcast. Either at our website, twit.tv/mbw. You can also find us on
[02:08:15.360 --> 02:08:21.280]   YouTube. There's a whole YouTube channel for Mac Break Weekly. And if you want, find a podcast
[02:08:21.280 --> 02:08:24.560]   application and subscribe. We're on every one of them. And that's probably the easiest way to get
[02:08:24.560 --> 02:08:28.720]   it when you do that. You get it automatically the minute. It's available. You don't have to think
[02:08:28.720 --> 02:08:35.040]   about it. If you are watching asynchronously on demand, there are two ways you could still
[02:08:35.040 --> 02:08:41.680]   interact with us. We have a great forum, www.twit.community. And we have a mastodon, a very active now mastodon.
[02:08:41.680 --> 02:08:45.360]   And since we're coming up against a thousand new members, which is really fantastic,
[02:08:45.360 --> 02:08:51.200]   that's at twit.social. No charge for either of those. I hang out there on both of them and some
[02:08:51.200 --> 02:09:00.080]   of our hosts do as well. So we'd love to see you there. I think that's it. I think we're done.
[02:09:00.080 --> 02:09:09.520]   Thanks for joining us. We'll see you next time on Mac Break Weekly. Bye-bye.
