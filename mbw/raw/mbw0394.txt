[00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:21.880]   I don't know if it's spring it's it's whatever it comes before spring when it's still snow on the ground
[00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:23.880]   But you're not freezing when you go outside anyway, yeah
[00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:30.480]   Pre-spring we don't know. Yeah, I don't know that's you mean like all year round here second second winter second
[00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:40.080]   And now ladies and gentlemen I give you Alex Lindsay. Hey, how's it going he is in Rwanda
[00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:49.480]   It's the giant head of Alex and look the asteroids are coming in he's rowing he's doing it. This is a travel log
[00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:54.440]   Hello everybody. How are you Alex is?
[00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:58.100]   Are you at your what do you call it the
[00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:01.440]   Right I'm at the African Digital Media Academy
[00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:03.520]   Adma
[00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:04.420]   Adma
[00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:07.120]   Exactly and Adma and and I'm training all week
[00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:12.360]   So so I'm here working working with live streaming and keying which is why we had this all set up
[00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:16.880]   And we had a little trouble with Skype and then hangouts and so we're back to Skype actually looks good looks really good now
[00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:21.640]   Yeah, yeah, so it's a beautiful African sunset. Oh it was
[00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:28.720]   Well, I've brought you all here to discuss the latest hot news from Apple
[00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:32.160]   But that would be a very short show
[00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:36.320]   So maybe we can talk about something else. I don't know
[00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:45.160]   Interesting things here. There's some interesting things. I think the big one is iOS 8 and the health book leak
[00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:51.800]   It is do we credit mark german with this? Where did this leak come from? That's all german all the time all german all
[00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:54.400]   it's I love mark rights for nine to five Mac and
[00:03:54.400 --> 00:04:00.480]   Brittany you probably know the kind of like the source for this information
[00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:05.320]   Is this a beta version of iOS 8 that he's looking at? I don't know if beta is the right word
[00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:09.820]   We'll get the beta ww if Apple holds to pattern. We'll get the beta at WWC 20
[00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:14.300]   2013, but it's better to think of iOS like a continuum wait a minute
[00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:16.780]   Okay, let's let's fix that 2014. Yeah
[00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:20.280]   We are now in a new year
[00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:29.140]   So whenever Apple does a new version of iOS there are features that are pushed down from the executives like Phil Schiller and there are features
[00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:34.060]   that are pulled up from the engineers everyone can put their stuff in a big pile and then Craig Federico goes through and
[00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:38.140]   sorts them and puts them into what they have time and effort to put behind and
[00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:42.020]   They'll start working on that kind of thing and if they get it ready in time for iOS 8
[00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:45.880]   It goes into iOS 8 and if for some reason it's not ready or politically
[00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:48.660]   It's not something they want to do then it's either held off for the future
[00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:52.800]   So for example things like inter-app communication have started to get bundled in two years ago
[00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:58.060]   But they haven't surfaced yet the app downloads that we got this year were being worked on previous to last year
[00:04:58.060 --> 00:04:59.980]   But they weren't you know put out until this year
[00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:05.460]   So it's hard to always tell and mark does a really good job of saying that in the article that this is what Apple is currently working on
[00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:08.720]   And that's what some developers they are working on and if they get it finished
[00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:10.720]   There's probably a good likelihood. We'll see it in iOS 8
[00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:13.060]   so
[00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:15.140]   These screenshots, I mean I don't think these are faked
[00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:21.620]   Of those are their mock-ups based on what they heard of the oh, okay. This is really important
[00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:25.380]   So this is not a screenshot this not yeah
[00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:31.260]   Someone told him what it looks like and then and sometimes you have to in order to protect a source or because it's low quality or because
[00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:37.020]   There's very there's very easy ways to indicate where it came from you get information and then you mock it up based on what you're told
[00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:44.220]   As detailed in the images throughout this article which are complete recreations of screenshots
[00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:51.580]   So they are screenshots recreated to hide the source. I guess you know where to get good quality version, right?
[00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:53.580]   Health books user interface
[00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:59.300]   Looks a lot like past book, but of course with different information. So let's take a look at what now I
[00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:05.140]   Admit to you know kind of overextending what this all means
[00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:10.300]   I mean this doesn't mean that Apple is going to have a device that tracks hydration
[00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:13.900]   Oxygen saturation and blood sugar those things are hard to do
[00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:17.860]   Yeah, now I think that I'm sorry go ahead Renee
[00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:20.340]   No, I was just gonna say they're hard to do now
[00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:25.060]   Yeah, but but but also the fact that they went before the past book model realized that
[00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:27.300]   Everything that we use in past book today
[00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:30.820]   They're not features and sources that Apple actually creates as used as a way
[00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:34.260]   So the third parties can put something in that nice little organizer
[00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:39.300]   So I think that also that does point to Apple having a phone that does a few things
[00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:46.700]   But relying on outside sources to create their own blood glucose meter or their own blood pressure sensor or their own hydration sensor
[00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:52.260]   As a way to simply contribute to this one central clearing house app that makes sense and it's like
[00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:54.900]   Microsoft's health
[00:06:54.900 --> 00:07:02.260]   Database or Google's you know late limited health database. You have lots of fields doesn't mean you're actually generating that information
[00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:09.940]   There is one thing that I think is significant that I think Apple is gonna do and I hope they do the very first card is an emergency card
[00:07:09.940 --> 00:07:12.220]   And I'd love to see how this is implemented
[00:07:12.220 --> 00:07:19.500]   But there is you know there are third-party apps that you could store your emergency information and I'm allergic to penicillin for instance or
[00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:22.020]   You know, I'm on certain medications
[00:07:22.780 --> 00:07:30.620]   It would be great if first responders would have a way to access an Apple standard emergency card as soon as they see an iPhone say ah
[00:07:30.620 --> 00:07:32.500]   quick
[00:07:32.500 --> 00:07:39.980]   Particularly if it's on the lock screen and also there's it's something really say this isn't something that couldn't be done on Android or Windows
[00:07:39.980 --> 00:07:45.220]   Phone but if you put it on an iPhone first responders know how to they're familiar with iPhone
[00:07:45.220 --> 00:07:51.620]   They know exactly how to unlock these things. It's not gonna be a mystery the way that like a lock screen app would be on an Android device, right?
[00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:56.180]   And the one thing is interesting is they are using the past book model when past book was introduced
[00:07:56.180 --> 00:07:59.700]   It was exactly what Andy said it was and it still is in many ways
[00:07:59.700 --> 00:08:02.940]   But they had past kit below it that kind of abstracted everything away
[00:08:02.940 --> 00:08:07.900]   So that it'd be very easy in the future to add mobile payments or to add you know contact-based payments
[00:08:07.900 --> 00:08:14.820]   And if health book has a health kit underlying it which you know, I'm guessing it might be then as Apple provides more first-party
[00:08:14.820 --> 00:08:21.420]   Services or as the third-party services grow it's very easy to start just adding those in to an interface that people have already gotten used to through
[00:08:21.420 --> 00:08:23.420]   whatever first-generation products that comes on
[00:08:23.420 --> 00:08:28.620]   Have we seen any of the other tracking software like the Nike?
[00:08:28.620 --> 00:08:34.700]   Sorry if you're listening to this they're keying me in front of planets anyway, so
[00:08:34.700 --> 00:08:42.220]   Yeah, exactly it's awesome so if we
[00:08:42.220 --> 00:08:51.060]   Has anybody else shown Kate calories, I mean almost everybody else uses points and my assumption was always because
[00:08:51.060 --> 00:08:54.420]   No, a lot of them have calories my fitness pal has calories
[00:08:54.420 --> 00:09:01.380]   A lot of a lot of them do calories the issue is how do you get that information in and like with my fitness power or lose it
[00:09:01.380 --> 00:09:05.100]   You have to buy hands say I had a piece of bacon
[00:09:05.100 --> 00:09:09.780]   I had a cup of coffee and that's a pain in the butt what the real this is great and
[00:09:09.780 --> 00:09:15.060]   It could be very past book like in the sense that it could actually be a limited utility because
[00:09:15.060 --> 00:09:20.860]   You don't have anything that measures your blood sugar your respiratory rate your oxygen saturation or your hydration
[00:09:21.180 --> 00:09:27.780]   But what's interesting is mark german points out apple has hired people in these areas in these arenas
[00:09:27.780 --> 00:09:30.620]   which kind of implies
[00:09:30.620 --> 00:09:33.980]   That they maybe would start building some functionality
[00:09:33.980 --> 00:09:41.140]   In a really cool thing too is when apple put the m7 chip in if you got a new fitness track or a new fitness tracking app
[00:09:41.140 --> 00:09:45.060]   You didn't start day one with that it could go back and pull everything the m7 chip
[00:09:45.060 --> 00:09:48.140]   It already tracked so you'd have like a week's worth of data already in there
[00:09:48.140 --> 00:09:51.460]   It's just kind of a good way to encourage you and then if you switch devices
[00:09:51.460 --> 00:09:55.540]   You keep your data because that data is being kept track of in the m7 chip
[00:09:55.540 --> 00:09:59.620]   We're now in health book and that's something that apple likes to do is to commoditize their compliments
[00:09:59.620 --> 00:10:05.300]   So that if you move from Nike to Fitbit or to something else your iPhone now means that that information is still valuable to you
[00:10:05.300 --> 00:10:12.740]   So how much of this do you think apple will do how much of it will third parties do how much of it will be available when this thing comes out?
[00:10:12.740 --> 00:10:15.300]   How much it is blue sky?
[00:10:15.500 --> 00:10:20.260]   Well, I think that I think apple's definitely going to take some a couple of the high points
[00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:24.180]   You know a couple things that are really gonna give people examples that get people excited
[00:10:24.180 --> 00:10:28.860]   I think that's kind of typical for them and then try to leave the rest of the harder stuff to the folks
[00:10:28.860 --> 00:10:31.860]   I don't think I think just because they hire people doesn't necessarily mean they'll develop it
[00:10:31.860 --> 00:10:36.940]   I think that you also want to have those people on site to look at the software being created and give you a
[00:10:36.940 --> 00:10:38.700]   kind of a
[00:10:38.700 --> 00:10:41.140]   Breakdown if is this really any good?
[00:10:41.140 --> 00:10:46.140]   You know I think that that also it probably weighs into who they're hiring related to this thing
[00:10:46.140 --> 00:10:53.620]   And there's the Motorola rocker theory too and Dave whiskers did a good job of elaborating on this recently where apple likes
[00:10:53.620 --> 00:10:58.740]   Let other people make the mistakes first so if they do the rocker they can better figure out the iPhone if they do carplay
[00:10:58.740 --> 00:11:00.700]   They can better figure out an apple implementation
[00:11:00.700 --> 00:11:01.860]   And if they do health book
[00:11:01.860 --> 00:11:07.460]   They can see a whole bunch of people and how they use it and collect all that data and then when they start adding apple services to it
[00:11:07.460 --> 00:11:11.020]   It's based on more than just what they're guessing here by the way also
[00:11:11.020 --> 00:11:15.380]   It's possible that they they don't want any part of of medical device construction if they're
[00:11:15.380 --> 00:11:20.420]   Blood blood sugar monitoring is literally a life or death piece of data
[00:11:20.420 --> 00:11:23.820]   Yeah, and if apple can simply say tell you what we're gonna give you
[00:11:23.820 --> 00:11:31.060]   Manufacturer the opportunity to make billions of dollars on this device while we quietly duck billions of dollars with a liability in case this
[00:11:31.060 --> 00:11:33.060]   Technically actual sensors screws up
[00:11:33.300 --> 00:11:41.780]   Here is the Y from Y bow now the original screenshots and mark german says credit to Michael Stieber at nine to five for making it look better than
[00:11:41.780 --> 00:11:48.460]   Apple's actual screenshots. Those are the these are supposedly the original screenshots. These are the much more lovely
[00:11:48.460 --> 00:11:56.540]   fake screenshots created a nine to five Mac are so it's ems and by the way the note the
[00:11:56.540 --> 00:12:01.140]   Oh, I see they just reversed the order cuz I was gonna say the emergency card
[00:12:02.220 --> 00:12:07.260]   Sure, they messed with the order of all of the things so we can't deduce anything from the order
[00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:11.020]   Does apple have the hardware capability to interface with?
[00:12:11.020 --> 00:12:16.500]   Devices that would give you this information for instance if you're diabetic you probably have some sort of pimp Rick
[00:12:16.500 --> 00:12:21.460]   Device I know there are iPhone apps and there's even hardware that goes with the iPhone
[00:12:21.460 --> 00:12:29.860]   Yes, we presumably this is all Bluetooth l.e. So right easy peasy easy peasy, okay
[00:12:29.860 --> 00:12:31.860]   I
[00:12:31.860 --> 00:12:40.200]   Think that comes to mind is she is it'd be a shame if the if the only people who have the health benefits of all of this are Apple iPhone owners
[00:12:40.200 --> 00:12:46.460]   You have to be an apple cut if you're an apple customer. I say actually it's a good selling strategy you live longer
[00:12:46.460 --> 00:12:49.500]   You don't imagine other manufacturers will do their versions of it fairly quickly
[00:12:49.500 --> 00:12:56.380]   Yeah, I you know the Samsung S5 has a lot of and it's actually some of the early the S4 and the 03 of us a lot of these
[00:12:57.100 --> 00:12:59.740]   Features they have an s health app that does track this stuff
[00:12:59.740 --> 00:13:02.900]   That would be the nice thing again
[00:13:02.900 --> 00:13:05.820]   there's no reason to assume that this doesn't all work with Bluetooth l.e. And
[00:13:05.820 --> 00:13:12.500]   I feel as though if Apple were to make this into a serious feature and to stick with it and not to simply put it out there and hope
[00:13:12.500 --> 00:13:14.500]   There's something happens with it then
[00:13:14.500 --> 00:13:22.260]   It would certainly cause a lot of these companies to start to make affordable sensors and affordable wearable tracking devices and make it a lot
[00:13:22.260 --> 00:13:28.060]   easier for people to afford these devices and then just as we tend to see with iOS development
[00:13:28.060 --> 00:13:32.140]   They will make an app for the iOS first and then after about a year
[00:13:32.140 --> 00:13:33.860]   They will start to make the Android version of it
[00:13:33.860 --> 00:13:38.900]   And so that will lead to that sort of egalitarian access to pretty much everybody who has any kind of a device
[00:13:38.900 --> 00:13:41.340]   You're right because a feature like this
[00:13:41.340 --> 00:13:47.580]   It's in terms of wanting to change the world. It's great if you're helping people who own iPhones
[00:13:47.580 --> 00:13:50.780]   It's awesome if you're helping everybody who has any kind of advice right
[00:13:51.180 --> 00:13:53.900]   Wahoo makes devices that
[00:13:53.900 --> 00:13:59.460]   I've used Bluetooth l.e. devices that talk to the iPhone like a scale and they make
[00:13:59.460 --> 00:14:03.660]   They make bicycle, you know computers and stuff
[00:14:03.660 --> 00:14:06.900]   That would go right into your
[00:14:06.900 --> 00:14:09.300]   Phone
[00:14:09.300 --> 00:14:13.660]   And we've seen with devices like they stopped making their controller because it was much easier for them
[00:14:13.660 --> 00:14:16.460]   Just to let Apple handle the display and the interface and all those things
[00:14:16.460 --> 00:14:22.420]   And these companies might find it really compelling to be able to put their UI on an iPhone and have to build their own UI on every device
[00:14:22.420 --> 00:14:23.620]   They make yeah
[00:14:23.620 --> 00:14:28.620]   If you all you have to do is now make a band and all I have to do is focus on that one component the sensor
[00:14:28.620 --> 00:14:32.220]   It not only makes that consumer device a lot easier for them to manufacture
[00:14:32.220 --> 00:14:36.340]   But it also makes it easier for them to democratize the sensor itself
[00:14:36.340 --> 00:14:42.780]   So people who do the who do one thing well will do it exceptionally well as instead of making this sort of you know
[00:14:43.340 --> 00:14:49.380]   Half-hearted attempt that's kind of an okay software, but the sensor is kind of wonky or the sensor is perfect
[00:14:49.380 --> 00:14:52.600]   But there's no really there's no way that someone's gonna use this two or three times a day
[00:14:52.600 --> 00:14:57.660]   That sort of stuff it makes sense that they would Apple would also meet with the FDA to say here's what we're going to do
[00:14:57.660 --> 00:14:59.300]   Here's what we're not going to do here
[00:14:59.300 --> 00:15:05.740]   You know here's we're not going to be for instance measuring blood level blood glucose glucose level
[00:15:05.740 --> 00:15:10.740]   But we will give devices a way to interface to the phone and store that information
[00:15:11.540 --> 00:15:19.060]   Dr. Mom and the chat room raises an interesting issue. There is a higher responsibility for Apple due to things like HIPAA regulations about privacy
[00:15:19.060 --> 00:15:24.860]   Once they start putting information like that into the phone there. There is a
[00:15:24.860 --> 00:15:27.860]   legal obligation to protect that information
[00:15:27.860 --> 00:15:33.660]   Although as we've learned in fact if you didn't listen to Steve Gibson last week on security now in fact
[00:15:33.660 --> 00:15:35.980]   I think he's gonna continue that this week
[00:15:35.980 --> 00:15:40.220]   He's been parsing through the Apple security document that we talked about a couple of weeks ago
[00:15:40.220 --> 00:15:45.480]   And he's been extraordinarily impressed with the lengths and effectiveness that
[00:15:45.480 --> 00:15:50.420]   Leinck's Apple's gone to and the effectiveness with which they have achieved security on iOS
[00:15:50.420 --> 00:15:55.740]   He says it really is you know very very high quality
[00:15:55.740 --> 00:15:59.180]   So maybe this is maybe it is prepared for this kind of thing
[00:15:59.180 --> 00:16:01.780]   There are people there that care really deeply about that kind of stuff
[00:16:01.780 --> 00:16:04.940]   They treat it as their data and they want the phone to work for them
[00:16:04.940 --> 00:16:08.780]   So they mean they're incentivized based even their business model is better aligned for it
[00:16:08.780 --> 00:16:14.860]   And they are individually incentivized to make it highly secure. Yeah, and also I think this is this is just remember
[00:16:14.860 --> 00:16:21.660]   We're talking about when the iPhone 5S first came out that we're talking about all the different features that are enabled by the a7 processor
[00:16:21.660 --> 00:16:27.060]   I mean, so it's a long long list and now we can add to that it allows Apple to do products like this where they have a legal
[00:16:27.060 --> 00:16:33.980]   Responsibility to keep keep a data secure and safe. These are things that are a lot easier to do with the a7 that they would be with any other chip
[00:16:35.020 --> 00:16:39.580]   spider is pointing us to a program in the the app store
[00:16:39.580 --> 00:16:43.500]   From Digidock. It's called pulse oximeter
[00:16:43.500 --> 00:16:48.500]   That will measure heart rate, but also oxygen use
[00:16:48.500 --> 00:16:52.180]   So there are you know, I don't know how how well it works
[00:16:52.180 --> 00:16:55.580]   But there's certainly that some of the groundwork is has done
[00:16:55.580 --> 00:16:58.700]   IOS 705 breaks the accuracy
[00:16:58.700 --> 00:17:02.900]   But we're working on a fix they say as like what Andy said with the responsibility thing
[00:17:02.900 --> 00:17:05.260]   If you remember back the original iPhone didn't allow turn-by-turn
[00:17:05.260 --> 00:17:09.060]   Navigation because Apple didn't want to take responsibility for you driving your car
[00:17:09.060 --> 00:17:14.500]   I'm like and then they allowed third-party ones and then fast forward all the way to iOS 6 and there was an Apple turn-by-turn
[00:17:14.500 --> 00:17:19.060]   And that took many many years to get there, but they had a fairly good not good
[00:17:19.060 --> 00:17:26.060]   But they had a fairly easy plan to see in place for all that. Yeah, by the way, this uses the camera to measure your heart rate
[00:17:26.060 --> 00:17:30.660]   You put your finger over the camera. I imagine that an I
[00:17:31.060 --> 00:17:34.260]   Watch for instance might have a better tool for that kind of thing
[00:17:34.260 --> 00:17:38.660]   Indeed
[00:17:38.660 --> 00:17:45.360]   Okay, I think I think we're I don't know I find myself every time I'm writing about this and I find myself about to
[00:17:45.360 --> 00:17:48.300]   Type the word watch in regards to Apple
[00:17:48.300 --> 00:17:53.800]   I find myself more and more one to hedge my bets and saying an Apple wearable device
[00:17:53.800 --> 00:18:00.140]   I'm not I'm not almost completely away from the idea that Apple's gonna make something that is
[00:18:00.420 --> 00:18:03.380]   recognizably a wristwatch right it might tell you the time
[00:18:03.380 --> 00:18:10.260]   But that might be the least of the functions right is it nothing like the like the like the Motorola device is gonna be showing off tomorrow
[00:18:10.260 --> 00:18:14.020]   That's already been like a tease in a couple images, which looks really nice
[00:18:14.020 --> 00:18:14.900]   But I'm not now
[00:18:14.900 --> 00:18:19.580]   I'm not sure if Apple really wants to go in the direction of something with a color screen with the what what is
[00:18:19.580 --> 00:18:22.940]   Recognizably a real computer display on it. Well, yeah
[00:18:22.940 --> 00:18:27.340]   But I think that I think something that that does give you your time and gives you basically what notifications are
[00:18:27.340 --> 00:18:31.420]   It's very hard for me to take myself seriously when I'm in front of you in a wheat field
[00:18:31.420 --> 00:18:35.860]   And it's all I gotta say so but I think that's something that did give you those notifications
[00:18:35.860 --> 00:18:39.900]   So you didn't take your phone out of your pocket and and gave you your time
[00:18:39.900 --> 00:18:45.020]   And a couple other little bits and pieces would be I think a great add-on for most iPhone users
[00:18:45.020 --> 00:18:51.100]   Motorola has announced the Moto 360 this is based on another announcement that came from Google today of of
[00:18:51.700 --> 00:18:59.500]   Android where this makes a lot of sense from Google's point of view that they would do the infrastructure just as Android has become infrastructure for
[00:18:59.500 --> 00:19:05.580]   phones they would do a version of Android that's for wearables. This is the Moto
[00:19:05.580 --> 00:19:13.180]   360 which I have to think has been in in in the works since long before the announcement of the Motorola sale to Lenovo
[00:19:13.180 --> 00:19:15.260]   Which has not gone through yet. There's still a Google company
[00:19:15.260 --> 00:19:21.140]   Moto 360 as you say and he keeps you on time and up to date. It's a watch
[00:19:21.140 --> 00:19:29.140]   Without taking you out of the moment or distracting you telling you what you need to know before you need it through subtle alerts and notifications
[00:19:29.140 --> 00:19:38.420]   The twist of the wrist you could see who's emailing or calling or what time your next meeting is so this very much is a notification watch and you could say okay Google and
[00:19:38.420 --> 00:19:42.660]   And talk to the watch just as you can with your Moto X
[00:19:42.660 --> 00:19:45.700]   Phone I have to say this looks like a nice watch
[00:19:46.460 --> 00:19:52.380]   Yeah, it's a it's a round screen around display. They're clearly trying to make it as easy as possible for someone to
[00:19:52.380 --> 00:19:56.500]   Wear this thing and not be calling attention the fact they've got something unusual on their wrist
[00:19:56.500 --> 00:19:57.380]   I mean again
[00:19:57.380 --> 00:20:03.660]   I'm so I'm at the end of my testing of the pebble steel and it's certainly within the bandwidth of what you would expect to watch to look
[00:20:03.660 --> 00:20:07.300]   Like but it's still people still expect to see around disc on your wrist. I
[00:20:07.300 --> 00:20:10.820]   You know and this doesn't seem to have any health
[00:20:11.740 --> 00:20:16.020]   Uses at all. It's really and it's like the pebble more where its notifications
[00:20:16.020 --> 00:20:19.660]   Insil as you does have a microphone which means you can talk to the
[00:20:19.660 --> 00:20:25.460]   The phone but it certainly has a motion sensor. Yeah. Well, that's an easy thing to build in
[00:20:25.460 --> 00:20:33.020]   I like I like how attractive if that image on the Motorola blog is what it's gonna look like. I like how attractive it is
[00:20:33.020 --> 00:20:40.380]   I think it's a nice looking watch looks like a wristwatch. Yeah, I hope it's not a rubber band. I wish they wouldn't do that
[00:20:41.660 --> 00:20:43.660]   Oh, look, they're making it with a maker bot
[00:20:43.660 --> 00:20:46.300]   This is gonna really slow down
[00:20:46.300 --> 00:20:55.020]   Sad because we hear the stories about the stuff that Johnny I've had has in his office. Yeah
[00:20:55.020 --> 00:20:57.900]   Amazing car size everything
[00:20:57.900 --> 00:21:04.420]   Use off the shelf technology see if it really looks like that. I guess it is. I mean, I know that's rendered but
[00:21:04.420 --> 00:21:08.140]   That's pretty nice looking. It's a leather band. All right
[00:21:08.140 --> 00:21:13.860]   I'm also really keen to see what people will do with the idea of a round user interface that
[00:21:13.860 --> 00:21:23.900]   It's not necessarily a revel. It's not necessarily a revolutionary idea or you know the the the the the human computer interface has been waiting for something as simple and
[00:21:23.900 --> 00:21:29.780]   Simple and effective as this but everybody has always been designing interfaces for squares things with with corners in them
[00:21:29.780 --> 00:21:33.260]   I'm interested to see what happens when they have to work with that kind of canvas
[00:21:33.260 --> 00:21:38.380]   I prefer this I prefer this and I have to say what I like is it has three dials
[00:21:38.380 --> 00:21:43.820]   So for travelers, this is great. This is this the Google where is this the Moto 360 video?
[00:21:43.820 --> 00:21:44.860]   This is this is the
[00:21:44.860 --> 00:21:49.820]   Where video and these are all pro these are imaginary prototypes and they take great paints to make them all look very different
[00:21:49.820 --> 00:21:55.340]   Well, if you look it looks like it's showing off the LG and the motor where now although they is there aware in it?
[00:21:55.340 --> 00:21:56.140]   Yeah, yeah
[00:21:56.140 --> 00:21:59.180]   So here's what I find fascinating if you look at my screen
[00:21:59.180 --> 00:22:03.580]   This is the Moto where image from the Moto video. It is an analog
[00:22:03.580 --> 00:22:12.100]   Clock my daughter cannot tell time with an analog clock. She's 22. Yeah, she doesn't I the I was she's in Mexico right now
[00:22:12.100 --> 00:22:14.100]   So what time is it there? She said I
[00:22:14.100 --> 00:22:18.060]   Don't know I I can't read analog watch faces. I said well. Where's the big hand?
[00:22:18.060 --> 00:22:20.140]   12
[00:22:20.140 --> 00:22:27.500]   Where's the little hand 20? Oh, it's 12 20. Oh, that's how that works. I mean literally they never studied it
[00:22:28.500 --> 00:22:30.340]   She didn't need to
[00:22:30.340 --> 00:22:34.780]   So this is very retro to have a clock with hands using an abacus Leo
[00:22:34.780 --> 00:22:36.660]   Yes
[00:22:36.660 --> 00:22:39.620]   I'm sorry daddy. I don't know what the abacus is
[00:22:39.620 --> 00:22:43.580]   I was it really surprised me. It's like I
[00:22:43.580 --> 00:22:49.380]   It wasn't that they probably did teach it, but I don't think she bothered learning it. She didn't need to
[00:22:49.380 --> 00:22:55.380]   I was at a class that like that they teach at UNLV for like the basketball students
[00:22:55.860 --> 00:23:01.140]   Yeah telling the time what time is it's mr. One now she can tie her own shoes
[00:23:01.140 --> 00:23:04.380]   So I'm happy about that, but that's by the way
[00:23:04.380 --> 00:23:10.100]   I'm not being completely facetious. That's also a skill that's being lost in the age of Velcro a
[00:23:10.100 --> 00:23:12.180]   sneaker
[00:23:12.180 --> 00:23:13.820]   attachments
[00:23:13.820 --> 00:23:18.260]   I don't really buy shoes with with laces anymore. Yeah, who ties your laces?
[00:23:18.260 --> 00:23:21.620]   No, and she definitely doesn't know how to dial a phone
[00:23:22.420 --> 00:23:25.940]   We're simple call your father rappy
[00:23:25.940 --> 00:23:32.900]   We just switched from buckles to laces about 1928. We're not ready for another huge change like that
[00:23:32.900 --> 00:23:36.500]   But that also that also brings up another problem that I think
[00:23:36.500 --> 00:23:38.740]   Tim Koch actually mentioned a couple weeks ago
[00:23:38.740 --> 00:23:46.020]   Which is that there there are people who just have been broken from the habit of wearing a watch on the wrist who don't they're not naturally looking to
[00:23:46.020 --> 00:23:50.580]   Replace the timepiece on their wrist with another timepiece that does other things to them
[00:23:50.580 --> 00:23:54.340]   You're making the pitch that wow why would I have to wear this thing on my wrist every single guy?
[00:23:54.340 --> 00:23:59.220]   I have to remember to put this on every single day. Why they might be actually smart because
[00:23:59.220 --> 00:24:03.620]   The people who wear watch is probably do want an analog watch
[00:24:03.620 --> 00:24:09.940]   I do another one to sell at 250 300 bucks for it. So now this is this is these are images from mo to roll
[00:24:09.940 --> 00:24:14.580]   That's it. These are images from Motorola, which imply that the face is
[00:24:14.580 --> 00:24:17.860]   Not physical
[00:24:17.860 --> 00:24:23.220]   I mean that looks like these are right now that wouldn't be physical. Yeah, these are uh, these are google now cards
[00:24:23.220 --> 00:24:27.700]   So this must be this must be like like Alex's green screen
[00:24:27.700 --> 00:24:30.260]   Google round
[00:24:30.260 --> 00:24:32.500]   Oh, I like that band
[00:24:32.500 --> 00:24:37.300]   When they made the google now interface like the syria cards, they were already imagining different screen sizes and different implementations
[00:24:37.300 --> 00:24:41.060]   I think that's a reason why that you know the card interface in general is so popular now
[00:24:41.060 --> 00:24:46.340]   Everybody yes, see there's the card interface but that's but that's round so
[00:24:47.140 --> 00:24:51.140]   Wow, look at that. I like that. Did you see what she just did? She showed her watch
[00:24:51.140 --> 00:24:55.460]   That'll work to the woman at the airplane. They let her on board
[00:24:55.460 --> 00:24:59.140]   I've got a QR code right here
[00:24:59.140 --> 00:25:05.380]   I've tried that once do you do our codes but not clock with that with all the traveling
[00:25:05.380 --> 00:25:09.460]   You do Alex if you ever done the passbook thing where you have the QR code. Oh, yeah, I do it
[00:25:09.460 --> 00:25:12.980]   I do it all the time actually, um, how does the TSA react to that?
[00:25:13.780 --> 00:25:19.380]   Yeah, they're fine. You actually get through the TSA faster with your QR code because they do this little when you have paper one
[00:25:19.380 --> 00:25:23.460]   They do this little circling thing and they you know check things off and when you have when you have a phone
[00:25:23.460 --> 00:25:26.020]   They just go click. Okay, you can go on a thing they can do
[00:25:26.020 --> 00:25:30.420]   You know, you're just giving your idea
[00:25:30.420 --> 00:25:34.020]   And it's like they're even like exasperated like I don't want to talk to you
[00:25:34.020 --> 00:25:35.460]   You know, just get out of here
[00:25:35.460 --> 00:25:40.980]   But the only thing is is that there's the one thing I always look at is the my battery when I walk into the airport
[00:25:40.980 --> 00:25:44.180]   So if I've got a it on passbook and my battery is at 8% or 10%
[00:25:44.180 --> 00:25:47.060]   I go get a paper ticket because there's nothing worse than getting to the gate
[00:25:47.060 --> 00:25:49.460]   You'll get through all the stuff and then you get to the gate and your phone dies and
[00:25:49.460 --> 00:25:53.380]   Then you don't have a ticket. I had that problem. I couldn't pull it up
[00:25:53.380 --> 00:25:57.060]   I've done it twice. Yeah, it's very embarrassing very embarrassing
[00:25:57.060 --> 00:26:01.540]   I when I when I use that no matter where it is. I always screenshot that page, right?
[00:26:01.540 --> 00:26:04.820]   I know I can get to the control. I don't necessarily exactly. Yeah
[00:26:04.820 --> 00:26:05.860]   Yeah
[00:26:05.860 --> 00:26:11.300]   It's actually the United app is actually really good at being able to just get get it immediately
[00:26:11.300 --> 00:26:13.940]   So it's um, it's it's actually easier than passport
[00:26:13.940 --> 00:26:18.260]   Like first I use passport all the time, but now I fly united most of the time and so I um
[00:26:18.260 --> 00:26:22.100]   I just uh use their own Alex just glitched. Am I in the matrix?
[00:26:22.100 --> 00:26:28.340]   No, I got out of the middle my my little webcam. See what here we go. I love it. He glitched
[00:26:28.340 --> 00:26:34.020]   It was a glitch here. I come oh man. I feel like I'm catching focus. I took the red pill
[00:26:34.660 --> 00:26:36.900]   There's an agent like Robin Williams and then what do you all want to be?
[00:26:36.900 --> 00:26:41.940]   All right, let's take a break that I just
[00:26:41.940 --> 00:26:43.940]   I apples
[00:26:43.940 --> 00:26:50.580]   The you know everybody's got the uh the story right now. I mean apple is putting it off. Do you think it'll be this
[00:26:50.580 --> 00:26:57.780]   Summer we've seen their rumors about phones this summer or when we're when we see this mythical watch and merge
[00:26:57.780 --> 00:27:02.340]   I think the wwdc is gonna be pretty exciting myself. You think that's why that's true, right?
[00:27:02.340 --> 00:27:03.220]   I think
[00:27:03.220 --> 00:27:07.620]   Man, it seems like the time to do it. It seems like what you want to do is show everybody what they can develop for
[00:27:07.620 --> 00:27:11.220]   I think especially if you want developers to be working on it give them some time to to begin
[00:27:11.220 --> 00:27:15.140]   I think apple is under zero pressure whatsoever to ship this year
[00:27:15.140 --> 00:27:19.060]   I wouldn't I wouldn't be surprised if they ship this if they show something this year, especially just the developers
[00:27:19.060 --> 00:27:26.500]   But apple is feeling absolutely no pressure to get this out the door and like like rene said that they they like the idea of other people
[00:27:26.580 --> 00:27:31.540]   rushing things to market so they can see not only how well these other approaches work in the real world
[00:27:31.540 --> 00:27:37.780]   But also why how how consumers are being reached by this what what messages are working what messages are not working
[00:27:37.780 --> 00:27:43.300]   So I I don't I don't think they're under any pressure whatsoever. Tim cook did say new categories this year though
[00:27:43.300 --> 00:27:49.060]   Yeah, you got an ipad for back leo. How much do you want from apple? There's your category. There's your category
[00:27:49.060 --> 00:27:55.140]   I just I feel like there's pressure building because of all you know, what sam's doing now mo to rolla
[00:27:55.620 --> 00:28:00.500]   Um, I think the real problem apple apple's not apple's not making any money and they don't have any money in the bank
[00:28:00.500 --> 00:28:02.580]   So I think the real problem
[00:28:02.580 --> 00:28:05.460]   For them to figure out how to make rent
[00:28:05.460 --> 00:28:11.300]   You know, there's two kinds of people there's people who who who are
[00:28:11.300 --> 00:28:14.260]   Are on payroll and people are trying to make payroll and right now
[00:28:14.260 --> 00:28:19.860]   You know apple is uh trying to make payroll. I think Alex and I are trying to make payroll
[00:28:22.900 --> 00:28:28.340]   The terror turns out a terror every two weeks. Here's a little something I learned you can't use a maker bot to make payroll
[00:28:28.340 --> 00:28:30.900]   Just I found that out. Oh, no, it's just
[00:28:30.900 --> 00:28:38.420]   It's too thick. That's the problem. It's just the bill. I told my employees this this week. We're giving you casino chips
[00:28:38.420 --> 00:28:43.860]   And they didn't buy twitch chips are paying you in twitch twitch chips. That's a five dollar chip right there
[00:28:43.860 --> 00:28:45.620]   One wants to work for granola either
[00:28:45.620 --> 00:28:49.060]   Although with hanging with twit coin, it's even better
[00:28:50.900 --> 00:28:52.900]   We're working on it in the basement right now
[00:28:52.900 --> 00:28:59.460]   Actually have a whole section of the basement committed to bitcoin. We're just planning to just yeah, that's our retirement plan
[00:28:59.460 --> 00:29:03.540]   Exactly and it works as a fabulous heating system
[00:29:03.540 --> 00:29:09.300]   You get your buddy ados coin. All right. We'll continue on
[00:29:09.300 --> 00:29:12.340]   Alex lindsey in rowanda
[00:29:12.340 --> 00:29:16.340]   The he's on the fruited planes of rowanda even as we speak
[00:29:16.340 --> 00:29:23.300]   Planes is the virtual planes. Yeah, it's beautiful. I didn't know that rowanda was the wheat basket to the world. That's fascinating
[00:29:23.300 --> 00:29:26.100]   According to Chad
[00:29:26.100 --> 00:29:28.980]   Greetings from Alex lindsey's windows xp dust
[00:29:28.980 --> 00:29:34.420]   Wouldn't it be great see wouldn't it be great if if if
[00:29:34.420 --> 00:29:39.140]   Everybody just did green screen like this and then and then Chad would have oh wait. No, no, we should do this
[00:29:39.140 --> 00:29:42.980]   We should do this. I think I think you're right. I think we need to send green screens to all our remotos
[00:29:43.940 --> 00:29:49.300]   And then Andy instead of having a giant boston clock over his shoulder. He could be in the clock
[00:29:49.300 --> 00:29:53.380]   Exactly. Yeah, I'll be hanging off it like harold loyd
[00:29:53.380 --> 00:29:57.460]   I also need to invoice you for a straw hat and a pair of round glasses
[00:29:57.460 --> 00:30:01.620]   Harold no arrow loyd knew where the big hand was I can tell you that right now
[00:30:01.620 --> 00:30:05.140]   Our show today brought to you by hover.com
[00:30:05.140 --> 00:30:07.620]   want you to visit hover.com

[00:30:12.580 --> 00:30:18.740]   Buy from the best domain registrar out there. It's the one I use all of my domains are registered at hover.com
[00:30:18.740 --> 00:30:25.460]   Uh hover makes it easy if you have in s I do a lot a great idea and you want it. I gotta get that domain name
[00:30:25.460 --> 00:30:30.900]   It's so funny to watch dikdee bar toe low. He just like he says i'm no he has hundreds of domain names
[00:30:30.900 --> 00:30:35.860]   But uh hover makes it very simple straightforward. You don't have to go through a hundred clicks
[00:30:35.860 --> 00:30:37.860]   to buy it
[00:30:37.860 --> 00:30:42.260]   They uh, they they know you want for instance privacy on your domain name
[00:30:42.260 --> 00:30:47.540]   So who is privacy is always included with domains registered with hover at no extra charge
[00:30:47.540 --> 00:30:54.020]   They offer the you know stock domain names the dot coms the dot nets the dot orgs and by the way dot net
[00:30:54.020 --> 00:30:58.340]   I again a little plug for dot net. It's a great choice. If you can't get the dot com
[00:30:58.340 --> 00:31:01.220]   I have leo loport dot net not dot com
[00:31:01.220 --> 00:31:07.220]   Uh, they also though do tv dot tv dot pro mobi biz io
[00:31:07.780 --> 00:31:10.660]   Country codes like ca asia us in the uk
[00:31:10.660 --> 00:31:15.540]   Right now lower prices for dot me dot co and dot info domains are having a sale
[00:31:15.540 --> 00:31:19.460]   Hover's great. They also offer google apps
[00:31:19.460 --> 00:31:22.500]   now
[00:31:22.500 --> 00:31:26.180]   If you don't know, you know you you probably maybe you use google docs sometimes
[00:31:26.180 --> 00:31:33.380]   If you are a business you can use google apps at your domain. So for instance mail dot twit dot com is our
[00:31:33.380 --> 00:31:35.940]   uh corporate mail address
[00:31:35.940 --> 00:31:39.540]   Uh docs dot twit dot or dot tv i should say is our corporate
[00:31:39.540 --> 00:31:43.940]   So that's google apps for business and it's really great, but you want to have a domain name that reflects
[00:31:43.940 --> 00:31:46.420]   your business
[00:31:46.420 --> 00:31:52.020]   Register at hover dot com and then you can use google apps for your business for as little as six dollars per user
[00:31:52.020 --> 00:31:58.820]   And this and the support comes not from google but directly from hover, which is great gmail of course calendar drive

[00:33:04.900 --> 00:33:07.060]   You're watching mac break
[00:33:07.060 --> 00:33:08.420]   weekly
[00:33:08.420 --> 00:33:11.860]   And I was wrong there's actually a lot of apple news today apple put on sale
[00:33:11.860 --> 00:33:17.220]   And eight gigabyte a version of the iphone five c
[00:33:17.220 --> 00:33:22.180]   Is this finally the low cost iphone five c we've been waiting for rene richie
[00:33:22.180 --> 00:33:26.020]   No, it's still I mean the pricing was unclear to me this morning
[00:33:26.020 --> 00:33:30.660]   It was on a couple of british carriers, but I didn't apple put out a press release for the i've had four return
[00:33:30.660 --> 00:33:34.260]   But they didn't put out one at least as far as i've seen yet for the iphone five c
[00:33:34.260 --> 00:33:40.820]   So I don't know what pricing will turn out to be but even for a hundred bucks less eight gigabytes is so in niemik on ios 7
[00:33:40.820 --> 00:33:45.620]   It is not not worth it. How much how much free room do you have on eight gigabytes?
[00:33:45.620 --> 00:33:50.660]   You have free room, but I mean it'll what four four five gigs. It's gonna go quickly
[00:33:50.660 --> 00:33:53.540]   It's just pain. I mean I find it painful
[00:33:53.540 --> 00:33:57.700]   If you don't do any put one movie on you put one movie on it now. It doesn't have enough
[00:33:58.500 --> 00:34:04.340]   Memory to install anything. It's about in england. It's about a hundred bucks cheaper. It's 60 pounds cheaper
[00:34:04.340 --> 00:34:10.100]   All right, androids centroid central put up a quick post saying these are all way better android phones. You could buy for less money. Yeah
[00:34:10.100 --> 00:34:13.300]   So why do it?
[00:34:13.300 --> 00:34:20.100]   I'm the only the most rational explanation i've heard is that they want to end of life the iphone
[00:34:20.100 --> 00:34:22.660]   iPhone four is still on sale in china and india
[00:34:22.820 --> 00:34:29.540]   iPhone four s is still on sale in almost every market that has the the old 3.5 inch display the old 30 pin dot connector
[00:34:29.540 --> 00:34:32.100]   Um, and it has eight gigabytes of memory already
[00:34:32.100 --> 00:34:36.900]   So if you were thinking about getting, you know, the zero dollar phone eventually on contract
[00:34:36.900 --> 00:34:41.060]   It might this might be a sign that they're going to get rid of those phones faster
[00:34:41.060 --> 00:34:47.060]   And as they start to prepare for ios 8 this september get the iphone five c down to where that can be the zero dollar phone
[00:34:47.060 --> 00:34:51.380]   Does it matter does apple even care?
[00:34:52.340 --> 00:34:56.980]   I mean they care to have an entry level phone. It's it's a slot that they're going to want to fill year after year
[00:34:56.980 --> 00:34:58.820]   I don't know how much they want out. I mean they
[00:34:58.820 --> 00:35:03.220]   I was just saying that I think they also want to get rid of that 30 pin connector
[00:35:03.220 --> 00:35:05.220]   I think we all want to get rid of the 30 pin connector
[00:35:05.220 --> 00:35:08.260]   And to that end there is a new ipad
[00:35:08.260 --> 00:35:12.340]   Yep, a new old ipad a new old ipad
[00:35:12.340 --> 00:35:15.300]   This is the ipad four
[00:35:15.300 --> 00:35:18.180]   Which is one jet
[00:35:18.180 --> 00:35:21.300]   I some may has to explain this to me late 2012
[00:35:21.300 --> 00:35:24.820]   Why please apple can you give them numbers for crying out loud?
[00:35:24.820 --> 00:35:27.540]   I guess is now we know why they don't right?
[00:35:27.540 --> 00:35:33.380]   So they were selling the ipad to they discontinued that that was the kind of really low price 30 pin
[00:35:33.380 --> 00:35:34.980]   uh
[00:35:34.980 --> 00:35:40.900]   connector ipad mostly for education and one of the things we thought is that the reason they continue to sell that is that a lot of
[00:35:40.900 --> 00:35:44.340]   Schools and and other people had invested money in
[00:35:44.980 --> 00:35:49.860]   30 pin connector things like big charging racks all with 30 pin connectors
[00:35:49.860 --> 00:35:52.020]   um
[00:35:52.020 --> 00:35:54.260]   But now they've got a lightning ipad four
[00:35:54.260 --> 00:35:56.100]   Is that right?
[00:35:56.100 --> 00:35:59.620]   Yep, we're in a display lightning 16 gigabytes same price
[00:35:59.620 --> 00:36:00.900]   399
[00:36:00.900 --> 00:36:03.540]   Yeah, or 529 with uh LTE
[00:36:03.540 --> 00:36:07.300]   So forget the ipad too. That's gone
[00:36:07.300 --> 00:36:12.580]   If you're going to get a cheap ipad to get the ipad the fourth
[00:36:14.020 --> 00:36:17.380]   Generation whatever the hell it is. It's some I mean it's on much better machine
[00:36:17.380 --> 00:36:22.100]   Not only does it have the oh, yeah play it as an a6x chipset not the old a5 chipset
[00:36:22.100 --> 00:36:25.940]   It's fast enough to handle a reddit display unlike the third generation ipad. Yes
[00:36:25.940 --> 00:36:29.780]   It's just big and beefy. I'm like the ipad here and it's got a lightning connector
[00:36:29.780 --> 00:36:34.580]   So the only difference the real difference is it's not air sized. It's the old size
[00:36:34.580 --> 00:36:39.060]   And they are now completely their apple sells nothing with a 30 pin connector. Is that right?
[00:36:39.060 --> 00:36:41.860]   Uh the iphone four s is damn it
[00:36:41.860 --> 00:36:44.020]   That's funny damn it and the iphone four
[00:36:44.020 --> 00:36:46.980]   Okay, yeah, but we can I think we can expect to get rid of that
[00:36:46.980 --> 00:36:50.980]   I mean, you know, it's so funny that the 30 pin seems seemed fine before the lightning
[00:36:50.980 --> 00:36:52.980]   You know the lightning
[00:36:52.980 --> 00:36:58.420]   Oh cable came out now. I have I still have an ipad three that I haven't figured out what I wanted to get and
[00:36:58.420 --> 00:37:00.660]   It's the only thing left in my collection
[00:37:00.660 --> 00:37:04.740]   And I have these 30 pin two 30 pin cables that travel around with me and every time I click it in
[00:37:04.740 --> 00:37:06.740]   I'm like I can't believe we ever did this
[00:37:06.740 --> 00:37:08.980]   So it's like an animal now
[00:37:09.220 --> 00:37:11.860]   So just to be very clear there's no two three four
[00:37:11.860 --> 00:37:14.900]   We're just saying that because for some reason we think we need to say that
[00:37:14.900 --> 00:37:16.740]   There are three
[00:37:16.740 --> 00:37:18.740]   Four models of ipads
[00:37:18.740 --> 00:37:24.900]   There's the ipad with retina display. That's the one we're the that's the cheesiest one
[00:37:24.900 --> 00:37:31.060]   The the the no the less the least expensive one. There's the mini is the least expensive one. Oh crap
[00:37:31.060 --> 00:37:33.460]   They still sell that
[00:37:33.460 --> 00:37:36.340]   Okay
[00:37:36.340 --> 00:37:39.860]   So the least expensive is the $299 ipad mini
[00:37:39.860 --> 00:37:45.780]   The next one up is the ipad retina display. That's 399. That's the
[00:37:45.780 --> 00:37:48.900]   I forget it and then
[00:37:48.900 --> 00:37:54.100]   I know but I don't want to say it and then there's the ipad air that's 499
[00:37:54.100 --> 00:37:56.420]   and also
[00:37:56.420 --> 00:38:01.220]   A 399 is the ipad mini with retina display. Those are there there's there's four
[00:38:01.220 --> 00:38:03.620]   iPads
[00:38:03.620 --> 00:38:07.620]   And the retina display mini and the ipad for our now identical prices
[00:38:07.620 --> 00:38:11.860]   Yeah for 16 gigabytes. Yeah, so good. There you go
[00:38:11.860 --> 00:38:14.580]   And they're all lightning
[00:38:14.580 --> 00:38:20.420]   To be fair apple does sell an adapter that makes lightning work with the 30-pin connector, right?
[00:38:20.420 --> 00:38:23.140]   Yeah
[00:38:23.140 --> 00:38:25.700]   Oh, look at this. It's like animal husbandry, but it exists
[00:38:25.700 --> 00:38:30.580]   There's a button compare ipads. There you go
[00:38:31.380 --> 00:38:33.860]   Go there and and compare
[00:38:33.860 --> 00:38:37.620]   store.apple.com/ipad/compare
[00:38:37.620 --> 00:38:40.660]   And this it makes it clear as mud
[00:38:40.660 --> 00:38:45.620]   And we put up two articles today going through the differences between all of them and then which ones
[00:38:45.620 --> 00:38:49.780]   Which features you get with each one and which one you should buy at least they all have unique names now
[00:38:49.780 --> 00:38:57.620]   And we do we know how this new slash old ipad registers itself with with iTunes
[00:38:57.940 --> 00:39:04.900]   Because one of the things that people found when they're digging into 7.0 and at 7.1 where references to new iPads that had not yet been registered yet
[00:39:04.900 --> 00:39:09.620]   Oh, so if that takes up one of those two slots, I think it's still 3.5, but I'll double check
[00:39:09.620 --> 00:39:13.780]   All right
[00:39:13.780 --> 00:39:18.500]   Well, I guess there's enough now lightning adapters in the e-coverse. They've saturated the system
[00:39:18.500 --> 00:39:24.500]   Yeah, that's that's essentially though. You rarely see this much real clutter in the apple lineup
[00:39:24.820 --> 00:39:29.540]   So right now you're apples telling people we have two different kinds of 9.7 inch ipad
[00:39:29.540 --> 00:39:33.780]   One is a little bit less expensive than the other but not so inexpensive that that'll push you into the buy call
[00:39:33.780 --> 00:39:35.700]   That they'll push a lot of people into the buy column
[00:39:35.700 --> 00:39:39.940]   We now have two ipad minis that are identical except for one is retina one is non retina
[00:39:39.940 --> 00:39:45.060]   The non retina one it looks like looks terrible, but it is slightly but it's less expensive than the other one
[00:39:45.060 --> 00:39:49.300]   But still not so expensive that if you are in any mood for
[00:39:49.300 --> 00:39:51.540]   For saving money
[00:39:51.540 --> 00:39:54.660]   It's gonna like again shift you definitely into the buy column or excuse me
[00:39:54.660 --> 00:39:59.780]   It'll be a big big deal to buy this one instead of the nexus seven or or kindle kindle fire tablet
[00:39:59.780 --> 00:40:02.260]   It's I think that we're gonna see
[00:40:02.260 --> 00:40:03.780]   I'm
[00:40:03.780 --> 00:40:07.940]   I'm confused by this. I'm interested to see what kind of a house cleaning apple has in store for the end of the year
[00:40:07.940 --> 00:40:10.980]   That would explain why they want to have these many
[00:40:10.980 --> 00:40:14.740]   Similar looking models of devices on the lineup at the same time
[00:40:14.740 --> 00:40:19.380]   I guess the other thing that's so important to note is that the Wi-Fi
[00:40:20.020 --> 00:40:22.980]   I'm sorry the ipad with retina display and the ipad mini the
[00:40:22.980 --> 00:40:28.020]   Low price ones didn't only are 16 gigs. There are there are no larger models at all
[00:40:28.020 --> 00:40:32.660]   It's interesting because previously you could choose between larger small retina or non retina
[00:40:32.660 --> 00:40:36.900]   That was our little matrix now. It's larger small, but the large ones are both met in retinas
[00:40:36.900 --> 00:40:41.540]   And now it's you know heavy or light but the small ones aren't they're the same basically the same size
[00:40:41.540 --> 00:40:47.380]   But they're not retinas. I wonder if this means I wonder if this means they're really feeling pressure for at least or at least they're at least worried
[00:40:47.700 --> 00:40:51.140]   about Samsung and other companies making larger size tablets
[00:40:51.140 --> 00:40:57.220]   Because that's one place in which people who are various a sense of the price are gonna basically say yeah
[00:40:57.220 --> 00:40:59.300]   I know iOS is better, but I know the ipad is better
[00:40:59.300 --> 00:41:02.900]   But and I like the I like the idea of being able to scuba dive underwater with the tablet
[00:41:02.900 --> 00:41:06.500]   But I think I'll rather have my $200 in my pocket and go for this other device
[00:41:06.500 --> 00:41:09.780]   Hey for the scuba lessons. Yeah
[00:41:09.780 --> 00:41:12.340]   All right
[00:41:12.340 --> 00:41:15.700]   Well now we now we understand all and the apples blamed it
[00:41:16.260 --> 00:41:19.140]   We we have we have pictures
[00:41:19.140 --> 00:41:22.420]   All right
[00:41:22.420 --> 00:41:26.580]   And then the ipad 2 is gone, right? Okay. Yes. Yes. It's gone finally
[00:41:26.580 --> 00:41:32.340]   2,000 a spring 2011 to spring 2014 not a bad as a long that's a long run
[00:41:32.340 --> 00:41:35.460]   I did hear someone say that they that
[00:41:35.460 --> 00:41:38.500]   I you know that it's dead. I'll pass this along
[00:41:38.500 --> 00:41:42.820]   I didn't want to talk about it earlier because it sounded like just more like an interesting rubric anything else
[00:41:42.900 --> 00:41:48.900]   That there was some sort of contract apple had in which they were required to be able to fulfill orders for this thing on demand
[00:41:48.900 --> 00:41:52.980]   If the contract D wanted them and that's one of the reasons why they decided that okay
[00:41:52.980 --> 00:41:55.780]   We'll keep this on the price list because it was it was a real mutt
[00:41:55.780 --> 00:41:58.260]   apart from being able to
[00:41:58.260 --> 00:42:01.700]   Keep the schools that had those rack chargers and rack distribution
[00:42:01.700 --> 00:42:03.700]   hearts ready
[00:42:03.700 --> 00:42:06.580]   That was that was a big mutt in the ipad line. Yeah
[00:42:06.580 --> 00:42:11.220]   Yeah, weird mutt and now but now we still have mutts the four and four S or mutts
[00:42:12.580 --> 00:42:14.740]   But those mutts will be detached soon
[00:42:14.740 --> 00:42:18.500]   From the help be available for adoption. Yeah
[00:42:18.500 --> 00:42:25.540]   Apple has turned on a new uh form of support paid
[00:42:25.540 --> 00:42:30.660]   Chat support if your apple device is out of warranty or you don't and you don't have apple care
[00:42:30.660 --> 00:42:35.620]   You could pay 20 bucks to chat with a perhaps with a real person
[00:42:35.620 --> 00:42:41.220]   It is a real person. You know they're training the apple care folks and how to use chat
[00:42:43.060 --> 00:42:47.620]   Um and they had the hangouts in the early in the early parts apparently in the first day or two
[00:42:47.620 --> 00:42:50.100]   Uh paying for it was not working too well
[00:42:50.100 --> 00:42:52.340]   um
[00:42:52.340 --> 00:42:54.500]   They call it the here to help program
[00:42:54.500 --> 00:42:56.660]   Um
[00:42:56.660 --> 00:43:01.060]   For the apple care employees teaching them how to care about the user
[00:43:01.060 --> 00:43:03.940]   My experience has always been with apple care
[00:43:03.940 --> 00:43:08.180]   I don't have a lot of experience, but when i've talked to them they they they they seem to care actually
[00:43:08.180 --> 00:43:10.820]   Which is not always the case on support calls
[00:43:11.860 --> 00:43:13.860]   So i guess it's working they're acting well
[00:43:13.860 --> 00:43:16.820]   As anybody use this chat support
[00:43:16.820 --> 00:43:19.860]   Not yet never never
[00:43:19.860 --> 00:43:27.700]   Uh here to help with consistent three-day training sessions apple says will transform apple care by sharpening our focus on our customers experience
[00:43:27.700 --> 00:43:31.940]   While continuing to provide fantastic product support
[00:43:31.940 --> 00:43:35.460]   Apple is where superlatives go to die
[00:43:35.460 --> 00:43:39.540]   Industry leading they just love their superlatives
[00:43:40.500 --> 00:43:42.500]   We ignite it super special revolution
[00:43:42.500 --> 00:43:44.100]   Fantastic
[00:43:44.100 --> 00:43:49.220]   We are so excited about this. We really think it's the best customer support
[00:43:49.220 --> 00:43:56.100]   We've ever been provided in this class by a company scaling to this parade in the us market over chat
[00:43:56.100 --> 00:43:57.700]   Could
[00:43:57.700 --> 00:43:59.700]   Over chat so uh you can
[00:43:59.700 --> 00:44:04.980]   Get free technical or diagnostic support or you could use to be able to get free technical
[00:44:04.980 --> 00:44:09.220]   Uh or diagnostic sports by just calling apple care right and so this
[00:44:09.860 --> 00:44:11.860]   Now they're going to say well
[00:44:11.860 --> 00:44:15.860]   You're out of warranty, but for $20 you can chat with us is it $20
[00:44:15.860 --> 00:44:24.820]   For one issue or do you get a month of 20? No, it's $20 per incident. Yeah, that's by the way
[00:44:24.820 --> 00:44:27.460]   That underscores how much it costs to do support it's not cheap
[00:44:27.460 --> 00:44:30.980]   And I would guess chat support is cheaper
[00:44:30.980 --> 00:44:37.860]   I know it's a lot of people moving to chat support. Why is that is is it because it's better for us the user?
[00:44:38.820 --> 00:44:41.700]   Well, a lot of times they're actually managing more than one person. Yeah
[00:44:41.700 --> 00:44:46.900]   And so a lot of times what happens is there they're actually talking to you and there's two or three of them
[00:44:46.900 --> 00:44:51.780]   They're talking to and they're answering your question and answering their question. So while you're responding there out answer another question
[00:44:51.780 --> 00:44:56.900]   Comcast for instance now, it's they really don't want you to talk to a human, but they'll let you chat
[00:44:56.900 --> 00:45:02.260]   I also think it's because these people these are not maybe their english isn't maybe perfect and
[00:45:02.260 --> 00:45:05.220]   They maybe have strong accents. It's hard to understand
[00:45:05.220 --> 00:45:07.780]   Uh and chats cheaper than a phone system
[00:45:08.020 --> 00:45:10.020]   I
[00:45:10.020 --> 00:45:14.580]   Is that so I I'm just knows a lot of people moving to chat for support
[00:45:14.580 --> 00:45:18.980]   I don't like it. You got a FaceTime call. I don't like it because I want to I don't want to it's too much type
[00:45:18.980 --> 00:45:22.500]   Also, let's them log data a lot more efficiently. Right. They have a record
[00:45:22.500 --> 00:45:25.540]   Yeah
[00:45:25.540 --> 00:45:29.780]   Is there somebody on the roof
[00:45:29.780 --> 00:45:31.780]   Where's that noise coming from?
[00:45:32.980 --> 00:45:36.500]   Wolverines since I'm up there with the broom. We've damn it
[00:45:36.500 --> 00:45:40.660]   Every time we get rid of them and then they move in. I think they're nesting
[00:45:40.660 --> 00:45:44.820]   Nesting Wolverines are you need nothing to mess with
[00:45:44.820 --> 00:45:50.020]   Uh, it's like clerks. Maybe you got people like playing roller hockey up there during their lunch break
[00:45:50.020 --> 00:45:56.340]   If they're if they aren't they should be because that looked like a lot of fun. No and the roof. It's very safe because we have uh
[00:45:56.340 --> 00:45:58.820]   knee-high
[00:45:58.820 --> 00:46:00.820]   Fences to keep them from falling over
[00:46:00.820 --> 00:46:05.860]   So that works. Yeah, I do a Wolverine Leo or any height one person. Ah, no, the Wolverines are completely safe
[00:46:05.860 --> 00:46:10.180]   Uh, I did not read Sir Johnny Ives
[00:46:10.180 --> 00:46:14.420]   Interview with the Sunday times. I admit I am remiss. I should have read that but I know you did
[00:46:14.420 --> 00:46:19.540]   We'll talk about it in just a moment. You're watching Mac break weekly now with Wolverines
[00:46:19.540 --> 00:46:24.820]   So that's pretty good. No extra charge good Canadian Wolverines. Oh, really?
[00:46:25.620 --> 00:46:30.660]   Really are they Canadian Wolverines? Why can't we buy us Wolverines?
[00:46:30.660 --> 00:46:33.860]   My god
[00:46:33.860 --> 00:46:36.580]   Thank you, old bama. I blame him
[00:46:36.580 --> 00:46:40.420]   We're suddenly we're using overseas Wolverines
[00:46:40.420 --> 00:46:46.420]   Our show today brought to you by fresh books also Canadian by the way I might add but actually they're nice
[00:46:46.420 --> 00:46:53.620]   So that's what's nice over Canadians. I like fresh books. In fact, uh, it was amber macarthur to introduce me to fresh books
[00:46:53.860 --> 00:46:55.860]   Many moons ago 10 years ago
[00:46:55.860 --> 00:47:01.220]   When I first started in I was going to Canada once a month to do the call for help show and I and I
[00:47:01.220 --> 00:47:07.140]   I was complaining or something. I kind of invoice rogers and they want in invoice and Canadian dollars
[00:47:07.140 --> 00:47:08.660]   I gotta make the conversion
[00:47:08.660 --> 00:47:14.100]   And then I hate doing invoices. I was using I think I was using microsoft word or excel or something and she said oh
[00:47:14.100 --> 00:47:19.860]   You know, you gotta try fresh books. It's a new startup and it's fantastic. They are I will give you
[00:47:19.860 --> 00:47:21.700]   uh
[00:47:21.700 --> 00:47:26.660]   These guys are great. In fact, I think something like five million people now
[00:47:26.660 --> 00:47:32.820]   Use fresh books not just for invoicing but for all of their cloud accounting, which is awesome
[00:47:32.820 --> 00:47:40.180]   Uh tax time is coming and I know you're kind of looking at that as a cliff you're about to fall off if you've been using fresh books
[00:47:40.180 --> 00:47:43.540]   Everything's easy
[00:47:43.540 --> 00:47:48.180]   Fresh books eliminates you don't have to hunt for receipts. You don't have to dig through invoices everything's online
[00:47:48.980 --> 00:47:50.980]   Tax time is a breeze
[00:47:50.980 --> 00:47:54.980]   And of course you get paid faster with your invoices because they're professional looking
[00:47:54.980 --> 00:47:58.100]   They and they have a pay me now button right in there
[00:47:58.100 --> 00:48:03.460]   You can capture and track expenses now with fresh book and even get real time business reports with just a couple of clicks
[00:48:03.460 --> 00:48:09.380]   Fresh books mobile apps for the phone and the tablet make it easy to do time and hours on the road
[00:48:09.380 --> 00:48:14.580]   I think the sooner you start using fresh books the sooner you could start focusing on the work you love
[00:48:14.580 --> 00:48:17.380]   Focus on the work not the paperwork
[00:48:17.780 --> 00:48:22.180]   So for a limited time. I want you to try fresh books. We've got a special two month trial now 60 days
[00:48:22.180 --> 00:48:24.740]   Get fresh books.com
[00:48:24.740 --> 00:48:27.540]   Get fresh books.com
[00:48:27.540 --> 00:48:33.700]   You you get a two month trial, which will make tax time a lot easier in fact, you know, you still have probably time to get your stuff in order
[00:48:33.700 --> 00:48:39.780]   Um, and if the all I ask is if they if you go as you see the how did you hear about a section just say
[00:48:39.780 --> 00:48:43.380]   It was mac break weekly get fresh books.com. Make sure you tell them
[00:48:44.020 --> 00:48:47.220]   You heard about on mac break weekly two months free just in time for taxes
[00:48:47.220 --> 00:48:51.700]   Johnny i've
[00:48:51.700 --> 00:48:57.620]   We can't get a interview with him even land or kani couldn't get an interview with him, but if you're british apparently no problem
[00:48:57.620 --> 00:49:00.900]   the sunday times
[00:49:00.900 --> 00:49:03.300]   interviewed mr. i've
[00:49:03.300 --> 00:49:05.940]   Did anybody read that?
[00:49:05.940 --> 00:49:12.500]   I read it. Yeah. I I'm the answers were incredibly similar to the answer as he gave you know in previous interviews was
[00:49:13.460 --> 00:49:19.460]   I don't want the right word for it, but it wasn't very illuminating. It wasn't very new. Yeah, I mean
[00:49:19.460 --> 00:49:23.540]   You don't you didn't he didn't they weren't I don't know what the ground rules were for this
[00:49:23.540 --> 00:49:30.100]   I don't know how much time the interviewer got with them, but a lot of it was I just feel like the the first thing I do is
[00:49:30.100 --> 00:49:35.860]   I think about what this product is supposed to do and only then do I think about what it should look like and oh, you know
[00:49:35.860 --> 00:49:40.980]   I never stopped thinking about how I can improve these products a lot of like really like inner
[00:49:41.860 --> 00:49:45.940]   Job interview questions where if you want to get the job say well, what's my biggest fault
[00:49:45.940 --> 00:49:52.420]   I don't I guess my biggest fault is that I never stopped thinking about how I could improve the work that I've done. Yeah, so
[00:49:52.420 --> 00:49:57.620]   I would like I mean it's it's I don't think it wasn't a bad interview
[00:49:57.620 --> 00:49:59.620]   I don't think it was an interview without value
[00:49:59.620 --> 00:50:05.940]   Uh, but it kind of was a very surface interview stuff that you would either you had already heard him say before or that you
[00:50:05.940 --> 00:50:11.220]   Could easily imagine him saying there weren't a whole lot of insights there carefully controlled. I'm sure by pr and all that
[00:50:11.460 --> 00:50:17.140]   Yeah, I mean it really did make me think if I were just if I was disappointed at all it only made me think that I hope that
[00:50:17.140 --> 00:50:23.780]   Apple at least is internally allowing people to do interviews and then just lock them away for x a month number of years because
[00:50:23.780 --> 00:50:30.580]   uh, if I think there's going to be a time when people are going to want to know exactly how were these phones made what was the
[00:50:30.580 --> 00:50:33.060]   What was the point of view of the people who are designing this?
[00:50:33.060 --> 00:50:35.300]   Why was this choice made and not that choice?
[00:50:35.300 --> 00:50:38.980]   Not even something from an engineering point of view but even from a cultural point of view
[00:50:39.380 --> 00:50:43.620]   They'll want these answers engine future people who are studying engineering are going to want these sort of answers
[00:50:43.620 --> 00:50:48.100]   So the fact that uh apple high especially senior apple executives
[00:50:48.100 --> 00:50:52.180]   They're so tight lipped and they don't really give interviews. I think that they're denying future
[00:50:52.180 --> 00:50:58.900]   Students an opportunity to learn a lot about how some of them one of the most important companies out there made some of the most
[00:50:58.900 --> 00:51:00.280]   transformative
[00:51:00.280 --> 00:51:02.280]   products of our time
[00:51:02.280 --> 00:51:07.460]   Michael scott right my biggest fault is that I care too much about people
[00:51:08.420 --> 00:51:09.460]   I
[00:51:09.460 --> 00:51:11.460]   Treat
[00:51:11.460 --> 00:51:14.820]   I thought one of the things I thought was interesting is the design team itself is only 15 people
[00:51:14.820 --> 00:51:18.340]   That's pretty seems small to me and a lot of them been there for a long time. Yeah
[00:51:18.340 --> 00:51:22.020]   Uh, the majority of work happens in his office
[00:51:22.020 --> 00:51:27.940]   Right with with with cnc machines right there so that they can have an idea they can bat it out
[00:51:27.940 --> 00:51:30.820]   And then put it on the table and then huddle around it and prod it
[00:51:30.820 --> 00:51:33.940]   I like this quote and again
[00:51:33.940 --> 00:51:39.620]   I the reason I didn't read it is because I didn't want to pay for a subscription to the sunday times just to read that one interview
[00:51:39.620 --> 00:51:44.980]   I think it's also on time. Yeah. Oh really? Okay. Good. All right because they wanted money on the sunday timesight
[00:51:44.980 --> 00:51:49.300]   Um, but so what I did is I read, you know all the other people who quoted it
[00:51:49.300 --> 00:51:55.140]   So much says uh jonnie. I have so much has been written about steve jobs and I don't recognize my friend in much of it
[00:51:55.140 --> 00:52:02.100]   Yes, he had a surgically precise opinion. That's I think that's very nicely put. Yes, it could sting
[00:52:03.060 --> 00:52:07.220]   Yes, he constantly questioned. Is this good enough? Is this right? But he was so clever
[00:52:07.220 --> 00:52:12.020]   His ideas were bold and magnificent. They could suck the air from the room
[00:52:12.020 --> 00:52:18.580]   And when the ideas didn't come he decided to believe we would eventually make something great and oh the joy of getting there
[00:52:18.580 --> 00:52:20.740]   Is that hate geography or do you think that's genuine?
[00:52:20.740 --> 00:52:23.700]   I think that's genuine
[00:52:23.700 --> 00:52:27.940]   Uh, it's it's it's consistent and it's it seems to be applied year after year after year
[00:52:27.940 --> 00:52:29.300]   Uh, though
[00:52:29.300 --> 00:52:32.580]   Though you're calling my attention the fact the the one thing that in this interview
[00:52:32.580 --> 00:52:37.620]   I think that I had not known before is that nice quote where uh, I've recalls traveling with jobs
[00:52:37.620 --> 00:52:40.660]   We get to the hotel where we were going we check in I go out to my room
[00:52:40.660 --> 00:52:46.500]   But I would leave my bags by the door. I wouldn't unpack I'd go and sit on the bed and wait for the inevitable call from steve
[00:52:46.500 --> 00:52:49.220]   Hey jonnie. This hotel sucks. Let's go
[00:52:49.220 --> 00:52:55.140]   So that sounds true. That sounds like the steve that we all know
[00:52:55.540 --> 00:53:01.140]   You can hear he actually says he tells a longer version of that story in the video apple put up for the steve jobs memorial
[00:53:01.140 --> 00:53:05.060]   And he says it in his own words and it's really touching it's well worthwhile. I love that
[00:53:05.060 --> 00:53:07.700]   We all know somebody like that. Yeah
[00:53:07.700 --> 00:53:09.300]   Um
[00:53:09.300 --> 00:53:13.700]   And you know that the the hotels they're talking about are like the mandarin, uh, you know, like really really
[00:53:13.700 --> 00:53:15.540]   Well, that's what I wonder. Where's he gonna go?
[00:53:15.540 --> 00:53:21.700]   So I mean the four seasons. This is horrible. I can't believe that they didn't have golden interested
[00:53:22.260 --> 00:53:28.500]   Water knob is on the left. Then what do you do the atrium if I have a waterfall, but it's not a great waterfall
[00:53:28.500 --> 00:53:34.660]   It's designed for the you know what human would want that but but I wonder what do you do then?
[00:53:34.660 --> 00:53:39.220]   Do you go to another hotel and another one after that another one after that or you stay in the jet leo?
[00:53:39.220 --> 00:53:45.060]   Ah, you stay in the jet. That's probably the it's a square sink. I can't believe that it's got square corners
[00:53:45.060 --> 00:53:48.260]   There is too much and the furniture in this room
[00:53:49.380 --> 00:53:54.260]   We are it is a hundred with all the lights on. It's a hundred foot candles too dark
[00:53:54.260 --> 00:53:57.620]   Right here. I don't like to gradient in the wall
[00:53:57.620 --> 00:53:59.460]   Um
[00:53:59.460 --> 00:54:04.260]   You can go on with the seeps. We were having this argument and steve said hey, I understand that wal-mart
[00:54:04.260 --> 00:54:08.340]   We'll just let you park right there in there. But then there a lot overnight. Let's just have the jet land there
[00:54:08.340 --> 00:54:13.140]   There's a reason why I spent so much time picking the leather in the stitching in my jet
[00:54:13.140 --> 00:54:16.820]   Um, they did ask him about the eye watch and he said
[00:54:18.420 --> 00:54:21.780]   Nice try now. Yeah, basically. Obviously. I'm not going to talk about that
[00:54:21.780 --> 00:54:26.820]   But he did say this which I thought was interesting he he apparently does read the rumors
[00:54:26.820 --> 00:54:31.300]   Right because he likened the rumors of the eye about the eye watch to a game of chess
[00:54:31.300 --> 00:54:34.580]   Which tells me?
[00:54:34.580 --> 00:54:36.980]   That he's reading the rumors
[00:54:36.980 --> 00:54:39.380]   He must be I think as anybody at apple would be kind of
[00:54:39.380 --> 00:54:42.420]   intrigued by what people think
[00:54:42.420 --> 00:54:44.500]   Um
[00:54:44.500 --> 00:54:46.660]   I'm glad he didn't say a game of thrones leo that would have been
[00:54:47.380 --> 00:54:49.300]   Uh
[00:54:49.300 --> 00:54:53.380]   Anyway, um, okay good. We we just saved you some money too much detail on it
[00:54:53.380 --> 00:54:57.540]   That's you don't need that many swords on a chair who would make it chair as swords come on
[00:54:57.540 --> 00:55:02.980]   Um, all right. So good. I'm glad I didn't spend the money. Although you're saying time magazine has it
[00:55:02.980 --> 00:55:05.780]   Yeah, it has the whole thing
[00:55:05.780 --> 00:55:11.060]   Is the times of london related to time magazine or is it just a coincidence? I think times just bought it
[00:55:11.060 --> 00:55:14.020]   Oh, they bought it. Yeah
[00:55:14.020 --> 00:55:15.700]   clever
[00:55:15.700 --> 00:55:20.500]   Would you say that uh, johnny ives comments about apple were mere puffery
[00:55:20.500 --> 00:55:26.180]   Uh, a california judge edward chenn in san ose
[00:55:26.180 --> 00:55:29.380]   Has turned down
[00:55:29.380 --> 00:55:33.460]   A request for a class action lawsuit against apple by a music teacher
[00:55:33.460 --> 00:55:36.180]   music teacher bought an iMac
[00:55:36.180 --> 00:55:41.380]   half of the computer's 27 inch screen went dim after 18 months
[00:55:42.180 --> 00:55:49.460]   The teacher sued and asked to be uh made into a class action for other iMac users who had similar problems the judge
[00:55:49.460 --> 00:55:52.500]   Through it out with faint praise. He said
[00:55:52.500 --> 00:55:58.580]   The judge said apples claims about the max big beautiful displays and long productive life
[00:55:58.580 --> 00:56:03.300]   Do not amount to false advertising their mere puffery
[00:56:03.300 --> 00:56:07.300]   So you win some you lose some
[00:56:08.260 --> 00:56:14.340]   Chen did say apple may have known about the defect, but it was not obliged to disclose the fault to customers
[00:56:14.340 --> 00:56:18.740]   If it fell outside the warranty period and did not create a safety issue
[00:56:18.740 --> 00:56:23.780]   And finally he said because it was 18 months in
[00:56:23.780 --> 00:56:27.380]   And the warranties 12 months. You just don't have any standing at all
[00:56:27.380 --> 00:56:29.780]   Mm apple care
[00:56:29.780 --> 00:56:36.980]   Yeah, I had a conversation with someone on twitter about this this sort of thing where they're pointing me to a posting someone made because they're their phone
[00:56:37.300 --> 00:56:39.300]   Their iPhone battery just went after
[00:56:39.300 --> 00:56:43.780]   When it was like four or five months out of warranty and took it to the genius bar and they said, okay
[00:56:43.780 --> 00:56:47.460]   We'll swap out a new battery will cost 80 80 bucks for the part we won't charge you for labor of course
[00:56:47.460 --> 00:56:52.180]   And this person on twitter was very was upset because they thought that apple should give better service than that
[00:56:52.180 --> 00:56:57.460]   And I had to point out that well, it's it's a 12 month warranty. It was out of warranty
[00:56:57.460 --> 00:57:03.060]   They replaced the part they're not going to charge because they they could take it in some place for free and have it fixed for free
[00:57:03.140 --> 00:57:11.860]   Just only pay for the cost of the part itself. It's sometimes it's difficult apple has such a great reputation mostly earned that it's hard to understand that
[00:57:11.860 --> 00:57:20.420]   They are not a magic company and they are a company that's in the business of selling consumer electronics to people for money
[00:57:20.420 --> 00:57:24.980]   And as a result, it's not as though they're going to say that hey this I know that your phone is nine years old
[00:57:24.980 --> 00:57:27.940]   I know that I know that you ran over it with a truck and then you spit on it
[00:57:27.940 --> 00:57:31.060]   But hey, we'll give you a free one because we're fabulous. That's not how it works
[00:57:31.220 --> 00:57:35.700]   So that's that's one that's when the rare liabilities that apple has for having produced so much
[00:57:35.700 --> 00:57:40.740]   Uh great service in the past so many great long-lasting products in the past and also
[00:57:40.740 --> 00:57:45.140]   Creating products that people have such a close emotional connection to they feel as though
[00:57:45.140 --> 00:57:47.940]   But when I'm not just buying a phone from from any other company
[00:57:47.940 --> 00:57:51.140]   I'm buying a phone from a company that I believe it in and oh no
[00:57:51.140 --> 00:57:55.140]   They only did exactly what they promised me what they would do when they sold this thing to me. That's horrible
[00:57:55.140 --> 00:57:57.300]   The expectation old debt
[00:57:57.300 --> 00:58:02.180]   Stuff does break and after warranties over that's the reason why the warranty is not infinite
[00:58:02.180 --> 00:58:06.500]   And to be honest, I would be very very bummed too if I bought a brand new phone
[00:58:06.500 --> 00:58:10.020]   And it required a major service after only about a year and a half
[00:58:10.020 --> 00:58:16.180]   Right, I would expect at least at least two years and I'm hoping for I'm really expecting three out of any major consumer electronics
[00:58:16.180 --> 00:58:21.220]   Imagine a $2,200 iMac 27 inch screen. You can't use it after a year and a half that way
[00:58:21.220 --> 00:58:25.540]   But but they've hit me up with the repair charges 500 bucks. They replace it for 500 bucks
[00:58:26.100 --> 00:58:29.140]   Right and and if this were such a big issue believe me
[00:58:29.140 --> 00:58:33.780]   We would have been guys like us would have been on shows talking about this for about every single week for about
[00:58:33.780 --> 00:58:36.500]   18 months since that product came out
[00:58:36.500 --> 00:58:40.340]   Clearly every now and then you get a machine that doesn't really work that great. Yeah
[00:58:40.340 --> 00:58:46.660]   Apple has dropped its 30-day return policy on iPhones. It's now only two weeks 14 days
[00:58:46.660 --> 00:58:49.620]   Um or it will
[00:58:49.620 --> 00:58:51.620]   I guess it did march 13th
[00:58:51.620 --> 00:58:53.620]   um
[00:58:53.620 --> 00:58:55.620]   So return it faster
[00:58:56.420 --> 00:59:01.140]   I guess I think that depends on local ordinances too because some places have consumer protections sure
[00:59:01.140 --> 00:59:04.260]   Yeah
[00:59:04.260 --> 00:59:11.140]   Carriers typically only give you two weeks
[00:59:11.140 --> 00:59:16.340]   So the break it faster the deal was kind of uh, you buy the phone you go
[00:59:16.340 --> 00:59:19.940]   Yeah, I don't really like it that much you got two weeks to bring it back to 18t
[00:59:19.940 --> 00:59:23.220]   But apple will say hey you got a whole month to bring it back to us
[00:59:24.900 --> 00:59:26.900]   um
[00:59:26.900 --> 00:59:30.260]   I can't even find the box after the second day. That's my problem. I
[00:59:30.260 --> 00:59:32.100]   I
[00:59:32.100 --> 00:59:36.100]   Generally, I'm so confident about apple products. I have to admit that I don't save the box
[00:59:36.100 --> 00:59:40.340]   And I can't say that for a lot of devices but for apple products behind me
[00:59:40.340 --> 00:59:46.740]   We need a part of the whole world. Well, you know, I tear it open like this rip
[00:59:46.740 --> 00:59:49.140]   um
[00:59:49.140 --> 00:59:50.660]   apple
[00:59:50.660 --> 00:59:52.660]   wants sam sung
[00:59:52.660 --> 00:59:57.220]   To pay $40 a device for the five software patents
[00:59:57.220 --> 01:00:03.300]   the uh, the judge and the court in uh in their apple samsung lawsuit said
[01:00:03.300 --> 01:00:07.620]   sam's not going to infringe upon $40 per phone or tablet
[01:00:07.620 --> 01:00:14.580]   That's a good deal. That's uh the the phone number tapping feature. You know, you've tapped the phone number and it dials it
[01:00:14.580 --> 01:00:17.620]   Uh in them email the unified search
[01:00:17.620 --> 01:00:20.660]   data synchronization
[01:00:20.900 --> 01:00:24.180]   Slide to unlock and auto complete those are the five patents
[01:00:24.180 --> 01:00:26.180]   apple
[01:00:26.180 --> 01:00:29.140]   Asserts and one in court that sam sung stole
[01:00:29.140 --> 01:00:32.180]   $40 a unit
[01:00:32.180 --> 01:00:35.940]   So that means that sam's like has to pay that if they continue to use those I mean, that's the argument
[01:00:35.940 --> 01:00:38.180]   That's what they want. Yeah
[01:00:38.180 --> 01:00:38.900]   um
[01:00:38.900 --> 01:00:40.420]   Florian muter
[01:00:40.420 --> 01:00:46.180]   Rights and foss patent that that is kind of an unheard of amount of money eight dollars per patent per unit
[01:00:47.460 --> 01:00:50.580]   Um, you know, you know, you know, you need to get that I bet you it's on youtube
[01:00:50.580 --> 01:00:55.220]   You need to get the brave heart thing where brave heart where where William almost rides out and uh
[01:00:55.220 --> 01:00:57.140]   talks to the
[01:00:57.140 --> 01:01:03.460]   To the english noble. That's pretty much app what apple was saying. Well and think about if it's eight dollars a patent the number of patents
[01:01:03.460 --> 01:01:07.060]   in a modern day smartphone
[01:01:07.060 --> 01:01:09.060]   uh
[01:01:09.060 --> 01:01:11.060]   Are roughly 125,000
[01:01:11.060 --> 01:01:13.860]   So don't ask for the move
[01:01:14.660 --> 01:01:19.380]   Let's see eight dollars a patent that's a that's about a million dollars a device in in royalties
[01:01:19.380 --> 01:01:23.460]   Um, it's funny because johnny. I've in that interview talked it like they asked him
[01:01:23.460 --> 01:01:27.300]   What do you feel about other companies copying you and he was non-plussed about it?
[01:01:27.300 --> 01:01:30.980]   He was like it's it's so hard to figure out these problems. It's so much sweat and toil
[01:01:30.980 --> 01:01:35.060]   And then someone just comes along and uses all your answers. Hey, yeah, but
[01:01:35.060 --> 01:01:38.100]   We've had this conversation before I mean, you
[01:01:38.100 --> 01:01:39.780]   Uh
[01:01:39.780 --> 01:01:42.180]   If we can set aside the sam songs for us a couple phones
[01:01:42.660 --> 01:01:47.300]   You can you can come up with a pretty good roadmap of ideas that did not originate with apple that apple seems
[01:01:47.300 --> 01:01:52.180]   The world of and decided to put into their own devices and but but apparently that does account though
[01:01:52.180 --> 01:01:54.100]   No
[01:01:54.100 --> 01:01:56.100]   Like you can land yourself, but you can't borrow it Andy
[01:01:56.100 --> 01:01:58.740]   exactly it's like
[01:01:58.740 --> 01:02:06.180]   It's like no, no, we we simply we simply saw the friction point and someone else is designed and we fixed it you're welcome
[01:02:06.180 --> 01:02:10.100]   I've florium miller is so incensed
[01:02:10.980 --> 01:02:12.980]   He actually publishes
[01:02:12.980 --> 01:02:23.140]   Uh the transcripts from this he says this is really punitive on apple's part trying to punish sam song because they really wasn't any other way to punish them
[01:02:23.140 --> 01:02:25.860]   um
[01:02:25.860 --> 01:02:31.460]   Well, we'll see. I mean the judge has a final say in this that's lucy coe. I think judge co
[01:02:31.460 --> 01:02:33.620]   Uh
[01:02:33.620 --> 01:02:37.780]   That will be are we taking are we taking bets on exactly when this thing will be completely
[01:02:37.780 --> 01:02:42.500]   Subtle ever and ever and i'm not talking about like us having to talk about i'm talking about where
[01:02:42.500 --> 01:02:46.740]   Whatever whatever sam song did they've admitted they've done it
[01:02:46.740 --> 01:02:52.500]   However much apple thinks they should they should pay and the judges agree that they should pay it then apple then sam song wrote the check
[01:02:52.500 --> 01:02:55.220]   And it's done with it's like for heaven's sake
[01:02:55.220 --> 01:02:59.620]   Yeah, $40. It's cheaper to absolutely pay it that's absolutely gonna happen
[01:02:59.620 --> 01:03:05.620]   I mean it's cheaper to hold it in court than to pay it right on throwing I mean for sam song it wouldn't make sense to settle
[01:03:05.860 --> 01:03:09.620]   At this point. I mean they're not they've got nothing to lose other than just to hold it in court
[01:03:09.620 --> 01:03:14.340]   Here's a cool thing that we didn't know about the apple tv update from last week
[01:03:14.340 --> 01:03:20.180]   We talked about it last week and how it allows us to rearrange icons and you know that has the jiggle jiggle jiggle thing
[01:03:20.180 --> 01:03:22.180]   but according to daring fireball
[01:03:22.180 --> 01:03:29.540]   apple has also enabled airplay device discovery over bluetooth in uh update 6.1 on the apple tv
[01:03:29.540 --> 01:03:32.740]   so um
[01:03:33.940 --> 01:03:38.660]   You don't need I guess it means you don't need bonjour to airplay anymore
[01:03:38.660 --> 01:03:41.780]   uh apple tv
[01:03:41.780 --> 01:03:46.500]   Uh can search for connectable devices over bluetooth bypassing not only bonjour
[01:03:46.500 --> 01:03:51.540]   But I guess what wifi they're not gonna send a signal via wifi. They're just gonna negotiate via bluetooth
[01:03:51.540 --> 01:03:57.780]   I mean they're not going to send the signal over bluetooth. I'll negotiate and then we'll then send over wifi. I'm sure
[01:03:57.780 --> 01:04:00.820]   I think that's how bluetooth fast. It works in general
[01:04:00.820 --> 01:04:03.540]   Uh of course
[01:04:03.940 --> 01:04:06.900]   That's it's but is bluetooth 4.0 in the apple tv
[01:04:06.900 --> 01:04:12.420]   Or is it the older bluetooth? No, I believe it's the car one. That's why you can do the tab to set up
[01:04:12.420 --> 01:04:14.740]   Ah nice. Very nice
[01:04:14.740 --> 01:04:23.460]   Uh, you have a nice review rene on i'mor.com of ios 7.1. It's been out for a week now a couple of weeks any uh
[01:04:23.460 --> 01:04:28.020]   Or is it just a week? It seems like time is how we get launched. Yeah, they didn't do a gold master
[01:04:28.020 --> 01:04:30.980]   They just put it live any uh anything uh to
[01:04:31.460 --> 01:04:34.500]   I mean we we had just gotten it when we did the show last week gosh
[01:04:34.500 --> 01:04:39.060]   That's hard to believe. I feel like i've been using ios 7.1 for years now
[01:04:39.060 --> 01:04:42.740]   I like the usability uh improvements. I have to say
[01:04:42.740 --> 01:04:48.340]   Stability is far there. No springs are fixed. No re springs never not one
[01:04:48.340 --> 01:04:50.420]   Yeah, it's solid
[01:04:50.420 --> 01:04:55.780]   I made the point in the review to say that some people will say this is ios 7 as it was meant to be but it's really more than that
[01:04:55.780 --> 01:04:57.780]   It's apple having spent six more months
[01:04:58.020 --> 01:05:02.740]   And the lessons they learned launching it the way that it was if let them bring it to where it is now and it's much solid
[01:05:02.740 --> 01:05:05.700]   It's much more refined. It's much more polished. It's much more consistent
[01:05:05.700 --> 01:05:09.460]   Uh, it's they used to put out the one the x dot one's much faster
[01:05:09.460 --> 01:05:13.780]   They used to come out three months later with the ipod touches and it took them six months to get this out
[01:05:13.780 --> 01:05:15.140]   There's not a ton of new features
[01:05:15.140 --> 01:05:20.420]   So it kind of just highlights again how massive the changes were both above and below the hood for ios 7
[01:05:20.420 --> 01:05:23.940]   Um
[01:05:23.940 --> 01:05:25.940]   The new phone app
[01:05:27.060 --> 01:05:29.060]   People have noticed has uh
[01:05:29.060 --> 01:05:33.940]   Look not only looks different but uh has some nice new features. That's good
[01:05:33.940 --> 01:05:38.020]   During you get a picture during the law on the lock screen, right?
[01:05:38.020 --> 01:05:41.460]   Is that new?
[01:05:41.460 --> 01:05:45.940]   The the button placement or new the button styling is new you don't get the full screen picture anymore
[01:05:45.940 --> 01:05:49.940]   I you know, that's right you get the little dot it's a little bit better for privacy. Yeah
[01:05:49.940 --> 01:05:52.980]   In mixed company. Yeah, especially if the picture well, you know
[01:05:52.980 --> 01:05:55.700]   Yeah
[01:05:55.700 --> 01:05:56.900]   Um
[01:05:57.780 --> 01:06:01.540]   Battery life some people have complained that they've it's reduced their battery life
[01:06:01.540 --> 01:06:04.980]   Have you seen that or heard that or is that just an isolated view?
[01:06:04.980 --> 01:06:09.460]   So that is absolutely true, but that absolutely happens every time ios is updated you'll get it
[01:06:09.460 --> 01:06:12.580]   We run a poll every time and every time some people say it's much better
[01:06:12.580 --> 01:06:16.340]   Most people say it's pretty much the same and other people say it's much worse
[01:06:16.340 --> 01:06:20.660]   And the thing that contributes to that the most is the update process because when you're updating a million, you know
[01:06:20.660 --> 01:06:25.780]   10 million hundred million devices some of those aren't going to be great. They're going to be bit rot on some of them is going to be
[01:06:26.500 --> 01:06:30.340]   But you know bad restores on other ones and all those things can just turn away
[01:06:30.340 --> 01:06:33.380]   They can have road processes and just waste your battery life
[01:06:33.380 --> 01:06:37.540]   But if you take a new device if you take a device and set it up as new an iOS 7.1
[01:06:37.540 --> 01:06:43.460]   You'll have as good as if not better battery life than you did under iOS. That's interesting. So that that's so it's a question of taking
[01:06:43.460 --> 01:06:46.660]   Croft from previous installs along with you
[01:06:46.660 --> 01:06:51.060]   I've seen some people suggest that resetting this all the settings is one way to fix that
[01:06:51.060 --> 01:06:56.100]   You actually have on imore.com a troubleshooter how to fix your iPhone ipad
[01:06:56.500 --> 01:07:01.940]   A battery life problems on 7.1. You say test the battery life on stand by first
[01:07:01.940 --> 01:07:04.980]   That was especially true in iOS 7 in general
[01:07:04.980 --> 01:07:09.860]   Like if you waited if you were if you had an iphone 4 or something and you waited to go to iOS 7 till 7.1
[01:07:09.860 --> 01:07:14.100]   There's so many new features you're going to be playing with it all the time and we actually tested this with some people
[01:07:14.100 --> 01:07:18.340]   Because they were using it so much the screen was on all the time their battery drained much faster
[01:07:18.340 --> 01:07:20.740]   They just it was it's you know new phone syndrome
[01:07:20.740 --> 01:07:25.220]   So it's really important to actually put it down and watch whether the battery drains or not when it's sitting there
[01:07:25.380 --> 01:07:28.740]   Because a real battery problem you'll put the phone down at 80 percent. It'll be hot
[01:07:28.740 --> 01:07:32.020]   You know pick it up again a few minutes later at you know 70 or 60 percent
[01:07:32.020 --> 01:07:35.940]   Yeah, that's key in fact being hot is often a symptom too when I feel a phone
[01:07:35.940 --> 01:07:39.460]   That's not doing anything hot then I know there's a runaway something
[01:07:39.460 --> 01:07:46.580]   Right the radios are the processes. Yeah, so you do say that so go ahead and also you want to know that we you want to look at where you
[01:07:46.580 --> 01:07:48.500]   Where you are like so
[01:07:48.500 --> 01:07:52.820]   I want to I mean I spend a lot of time in a lot of different places and uh if you have um
[01:07:53.620 --> 01:07:58.740]   If you're in a location or a city that has a lot of either a lot of congestion or a lot of bad cell service
[01:07:58.740 --> 01:08:03.300]   Your phone is going to burn up a lot faster. So um because it's constantly looking for towers
[01:08:03.300 --> 01:08:05.380]   It's constantly trying to negotiate
[01:08:05.380 --> 01:08:08.580]   And that really uh will tie up your battery very quickly and I think
[01:08:08.580 --> 01:08:13.780]   I notice it. I mean I spend enough time in different cities that that I notice that certain cities that actually
[01:08:13.780 --> 01:08:18.180]   I blame on uh on my uh on my battery life
[01:08:18.180 --> 01:08:20.980]   So I know that I'm going to like in Rwanda as a good example
[01:08:21.460 --> 01:08:25.540]   Uh, it's constantly changing things around and moving things around and so my I have to keep keep
[01:08:25.540 --> 01:08:28.180]   Uh charged up much more often than than I would home
[01:08:28.180 --> 01:08:33.780]   Yeah, race to sleep if you could if the phone can power down faster a lot of the battery life will last much longer
[01:08:33.780 --> 01:08:37.380]   But uh, you do mention that it's not a bad idea to
[01:08:37.380 --> 01:08:43.300]   Power cycle if that doesn't fix it then reset uh the data not res not erase data
[01:08:43.300 --> 01:08:46.980]   But reset the settings if that doesn't work then a clean install
[01:08:46.980 --> 01:08:51.380]   Yeah, you know, I think it's actually good. It's it's really good to power cycle
[01:08:51.700 --> 01:08:55.860]   Every once in a while anyway every I tend I've gotten into the habit of power cycle and every day or two
[01:08:55.860 --> 01:08:58.820]   Just to make sure that I have no idea what's running in the background sometime
[01:08:58.820 --> 01:09:02.420]   I mean I I can probably find out but it's just easier just to turn it off and on every once in a while
[01:09:02.420 --> 01:09:05.140]   I find that it definitely there was something back there
[01:09:05.140 --> 01:09:07.700]   Um, that was you know burning up
[01:09:07.700 --> 01:09:12.020]   Time for some reason. Yeah, it's I think it's a
[01:09:12.020 --> 01:09:14.820]   On both my desktops and my mobile devices
[01:09:14.820 --> 01:09:17.860]   It's a good idea to restart them once a week or two because
[01:09:18.420 --> 01:09:22.580]   They're these tiny little gas leaks that will never ever really show themselves until there's enough
[01:09:22.580 --> 01:09:26.420]   Critical gas to cross the explosion and sometimes it takes weeks for that to happen
[01:09:26.420 --> 01:09:30.500]   But also that if I haven't done a full factory reset of a device in a while
[01:09:30.500 --> 01:09:32.020]   I'll probably go ahead and do that
[01:09:32.020 --> 01:09:38.580]   If I if I usually if I've got like a big deadline that I really would I have loved having excuse to like not have to work for an entire afternoon
[01:09:38.580 --> 01:09:43.380]   I mean, I will I will take that opportunity to say that I'm going to not simply upgrade to 7.1
[01:09:43.380 --> 01:09:45.380]   I'm going to wipe the device and start all over again
[01:09:45.540 --> 01:09:49.460]   Because it's not just what rene was talking about about cruft building up in the system
[01:09:49.460 --> 01:09:57.140]   It's also like human cruft building up because how many times do you like download like a free game and then forget about it
[01:09:57.140 --> 01:10:00.340]   And I'm still there then you download something else forget about it and it's still there
[01:10:00.340 --> 01:10:04.980]   It's only when you start off with just this the bog standard collection of icons
[01:10:04.980 --> 01:10:10.500]   And then you only add icons back when you realize that oh I need omnia outlet or oh I need my day planner
[01:10:10.500 --> 01:10:13.060]   Oh, I need my my contact manager. Oh, I need this game
[01:10:13.300 --> 01:10:19.460]   You realize two weeks later that you only needed eight of those 93 apps you had pre-installed that you hadn't stalled before
[01:10:19.460 --> 01:10:25.620]   Here's some good news. Not only will apple iphone users users be more healthy than android users
[01:10:25.620 --> 01:10:28.340]   They'll get better entertainment and united flights
[01:10:28.340 --> 01:10:32.580]   United has an in-flight movie service. It'll be starting next month
[01:10:32.580 --> 01:10:36.740]   They say exclusively for apple i devices
[01:10:36.740 --> 01:10:42.900]   If you're on an android phone, you're just gonna have to watch the seat pack like everyone else
[01:10:43.380 --> 01:10:45.380]   It goes through the united app
[01:10:45.380 --> 01:10:50.820]   Uh, so you'll make sure you want to install the united app on your uh on your iphone or ipad
[01:10:50.820 --> 01:10:53.220]   And then I guess it's going to use
[01:10:53.220 --> 01:10:55.220]   uh, the wi-fi
[01:10:55.220 --> 01:10:58.580]   Uh to download content to your device
[01:10:58.580 --> 01:11:01.380]   While you're in the air and you can watch it on your device
[01:11:01.380 --> 01:11:09.220]   Wow one of one of the things I think that they're probably doing with the content there is that they are probably not sending you all the way to the ground
[01:11:09.300 --> 01:11:14.100]   So they're caching all of the movies that you may want to watch and so you're you're accessing wi-fi
[01:11:14.100 --> 01:11:21.380]   But you're not accessing the you know the antennas and so it's going to be easier for them to serve and and I think that it's actually not that you'll be watching the screen
[01:11:21.380 --> 01:11:26.820]   Uh in front of you. I think a lot of the united flights, um do not have screens and I think that this is partially
[01:11:26.820 --> 01:11:30.420]   We don't want to install uh all those screens
[01:11:30.420 --> 01:11:34.420]   Um, and so I think that no not obviously there'll be an android version at some point
[01:11:34.420 --> 01:11:39.220]   But uh, sure it was just easier to do the the i- they probably did a lot of research on how many people are using
[01:11:39.300 --> 01:11:41.300]   their app and decided
[01:11:41.300 --> 01:11:46.100]   that uh, you know a certain percentage of more using the i- are from ios and
[01:11:46.100 --> 01:11:49.140]   Made a calculated decision to release that one first
[01:11:49.140 --> 01:11:55.300]   Plus if it giving get somebody to install the stall the united app that we're not installing it before
[01:11:55.300 --> 01:12:00.660]   That alone is a huge huge win because that now you've got entry into the device occurring around everywhere
[01:12:00.660 --> 01:12:04.900]   So that's that's that's and itself is a big win, but I agree with that. That's nothing that I thought of
[01:12:05.300 --> 01:12:08.900]   Uh, I like united but they tend whenever I fly united
[01:12:08.900 --> 01:12:14.660]   I tend to notice not only a certain lack of seatback videos, but even you know, uh,
[01:12:14.660 --> 01:12:18.260]   I know smoking signs been covered over once or twice. It's not a really new fleet
[01:12:18.260 --> 01:12:24.660]   I very i'm very i'm very i'm gonna see with an ashtray and the ashtray in the armrest
[01:12:24.660 --> 01:12:29.380]   That's that always amazing. Yeah, you know, that's an old plan when it's gonna ashtray in the seatrest
[01:12:29.380 --> 01:12:33.140]   Not only an old plan, but one that hasn't been redecorated in several decades
[01:12:33.700 --> 01:12:35.700]   You can still see the brand if logo someplace
[01:12:35.700 --> 01:12:39.300]   Gonna pay the 20 bucks seat upgrade price
[01:12:39.300 --> 01:12:46.340]   All right, let's uh, let's take a break
[01:12:46.340 --> 01:12:51.380]   And we come back our picks of the week our show today brought to you by our friends at squarespace.com

[01:13:08.740 --> 01:13:11.140]   They should have used squarespace
[01:13:11.140 --> 01:13:17.220]   But there's a lot of other reasons to use a squarespace because it's not just hosting. It's also the best software

[01:15:40.260 --> 01:15:44.020]   You Alex lensy mr. Green screen
[01:15:44.020 --> 01:15:47.220]   So the green screen I don't think really properly
[01:15:48.420 --> 01:15:49.220]   uh
[01:15:49.220 --> 01:15:53.620]   Gives proper credit to this uh the green screen key that's being pulled it gives proper credit to this camera
[01:15:53.620 --> 01:15:55.860]   That that i'm using i'm not using a big camera
[01:15:55.860 --> 01:16:02.260]   Um, I was using a big camera and then I had to go and grab this one and and I and I has a take because I love this camera
[01:16:02.260 --> 01:16:04.500]   So much I had to tell only one because it's kind of a secret weapon
[01:16:04.500 --> 01:16:09.700]   That we that we have here. So, um, this is uh, this is the camera that i'm using right now
[01:16:09.700 --> 01:16:13.300]   I can't take it off and show it to you, but it is the uh, sisco
[01:16:13.300 --> 01:16:15.940]   uh precision hd camera
[01:16:16.660 --> 01:16:23.940]   and um, this is a uh, um, it's pretty it's pretty nifty. It's um, it's got a 15 15 millimeter f o b
[01:16:23.940 --> 01:16:27.220]   And if you I don't have a I don't have a 920 with me
[01:16:27.220 --> 01:16:30.500]   But we've been using law to tech 920s and 930s for a long time
[01:16:30.500 --> 01:16:35.780]   We probably have nearly a hundred of them for some reason or another somewhere and um, uh, uh, uh,
[01:16:35.780 --> 01:16:39.860]   And we uh, anyway, we started started using this one and um
[01:16:39.860 --> 01:16:44.660]   The it's a much more it's not cheap. I will admit and even those ones there
[01:16:44.660 --> 01:16:47.620]   I mean we bought on someone else. I think that the real price is probably 300
[01:16:47.620 --> 01:16:49.060]   $320
[01:16:49.060 --> 01:16:53.380]   Whoa, so it's it's a real but the thing is is that it's a real webcam and it and it uh
[01:16:53.380 --> 01:17:00.580]   It's got a larger, um, you know, it's got a larger chip, um in it and uh, it uh, it definitely um
[01:17:00.580 --> 01:17:06.100]   Is a much higher quality, uh, video in our opinion now it doesn't look that good when Chad's keen me all the time
[01:17:06.100 --> 01:17:07.300]   but uh
[01:17:07.300 --> 01:17:12.900]   Actually, the key works pretty well. It's actually good. The key work member and that's palax is calling us from africa ladies and gentlemen
[01:17:12.900 --> 01:17:14.900]   This is not he's not next door
[01:17:14.900 --> 01:17:19.540]   Right exactly so, um, but it's uh, you know, the thing is is one of the things that we had to complain about
[01:17:19.540 --> 01:17:25.460]   Uh, is having the really wide angle that the 929 30 create 930 especially 930 is great for uh
[01:17:25.460 --> 01:17:29.140]   Crowds crowd, you know, like three or four people sit in front of the camera
[01:17:29.140 --> 01:17:32.260]   Yeah, um if you're a single person trying to sit in front of a camera
[01:17:32.260 --> 01:17:37.220]   In our opinion our new opinion right now is that this is probably and we test almost every webcam
[01:17:37.220 --> 01:17:41.540]   This is why we love having alex right next door because
[01:17:42.260 --> 01:17:44.260]   You know, we've been recommending
[01:17:44.260 --> 01:17:48.740]   Uh, the logitech for so long. This is a whole this is a whole and it's still and and we still love the logitech
[01:17:48.740 --> 01:17:51.700]   I mean, it's still a great sharp was a lot less expensive. Um, so i have as much
[01:17:51.700 --> 01:17:56.660]   The other the other issue, uh, that you get into is that if you have an office
[01:17:56.660 --> 01:17:58.900]   There's a lot less office too that you have to clean up
[01:17:58.900 --> 01:18:03.380]   Um because it's uh, you know, it's half a field of view or not not quite half the field of view
[01:18:03.380 --> 01:18:05.620]   But um, so there's a lot less information behind you as well
[01:18:05.620 --> 01:18:11.620]   Um, makes it a lot easier for you to kind of manage that process. I think so um, and um, yeah
[01:18:11.620 --> 01:18:16.180]   So so anyway, it's uh, it's uh pretty nifty. So, um, um, that's my recommendation
[01:18:16.180 --> 01:18:19.220]   Is the sisco
[01:18:19.220 --> 01:18:21.620]   telepresence camera
[01:18:21.620 --> 01:18:28.580]   All right, so this is a tambourine. Oh, it's a tambourine. It's a big name. Yeah, yeah, it came it came with it when they went sisco bought them
[01:18:28.580 --> 01:18:31.620]   Got it sisco teleprecision telepresence
[01:18:31.620 --> 01:18:35.220]   precision hd
[01:18:35.220 --> 01:18:37.620]   Thing camera
[01:18:37.620 --> 01:18:39.300]   There you go
[01:18:39.380 --> 01:18:42.340]   Doesn't it does have a model number, but if I tell you that you're not gonna care
[01:18:42.340 --> 01:18:46.820]   It's too long to do is search for sisco precision. You'll find it precision hd. All right
[01:18:46.820 --> 01:18:52.020]   Renee richy. We know you have one negative view actually the whole panel that I haven't read it yet, but uh
[01:18:52.020 --> 01:18:55.460]   Last week we made reference to a new book about
[01:18:55.460 --> 01:19:00.260]   Apple haunted was it haunted empire? Yes, we should tell you a lot about the
[01:19:00.260 --> 01:19:04.100]   Slant of the book to begin. Yeah by former wall street journal reporter
[01:19:04.100 --> 01:19:08.100]   You know, it made it pretty clear that steve jobs was haunting apple
[01:19:08.900 --> 01:19:16.740]   Uh, and now you and Annie both said no not good turned it turned out to just be the the old man owner of the amusement park trying to scare off the buyers
[01:19:16.740 --> 01:19:18.740]   For the new for the new
[01:19:18.740 --> 01:19:24.020]   Pulled off the ghost steve jobs mask and that's what turned out to be
[01:19:24.020 --> 01:19:27.540]   Not a good. So don't get this book in other words. No
[01:19:27.540 --> 01:19:30.740]   Like I said, I have a ton of respect for her as a reporter. She has an amazing career
[01:19:30.740 --> 01:19:34.500]   She covered the hell out of apple for the wall street journal for many years, but this is not a book
[01:19:34.500 --> 01:19:37.540]   This is a weird series of anecdotes mixed with
[01:19:38.100 --> 01:19:43.060]   Unsubstance unsubstantiated opinions that don't sort of link together. It's very odd
[01:19:43.060 --> 01:19:46.100]   Let's get your recommendation since you dis recommend that
[01:19:46.100 --> 01:19:52.260]   So if you're not yes, so don't spend your time reading that spend your time watching the veronica mars movie that really it hit yes
[01:19:52.260 --> 01:19:56.980]   Uh, so I like this for many reasons. I actually was a fan of vanna kamars. I like the television series
[01:19:56.980 --> 01:20:01.300]   Um, the movie was pretty much what I expected it to be but I love the idea of this movie
[01:20:01.300 --> 01:20:07.140]   As someone who watched tv shows like firefly get canceled like angel get canceled like veronica mars get canceled
[01:20:07.380 --> 01:20:11.140]   The idea that a creator could go to kickstarter and fund a movie
[01:20:11.140 --> 01:20:17.300]   And that movie could go out in movie theaters and hit itunes the same day it hit movie theater is not you know
[01:20:17.300 --> 01:20:21.220]   Six months later a year later the same day it was in movie theaters
[01:20:21.220 --> 01:20:28.180]   I think it was six or seven ninety nine to rent 24.99 to buy you didn't if you wanted to you could go and enjoy it with your popcorn
[01:20:28.180 --> 01:20:30.660]   And ten dollar beverage on a giant screen
[01:20:30.660 --> 01:20:34.500]   And if you didn't want to you could pay a little bit more money and enjoy it in your home theater
[01:20:34.900 --> 01:20:41.380]   And that model has an incredible amount of appeal to me. So on one hand, I'm happy that you know christen bell
[01:20:41.380 --> 01:20:46.340]   The rob tom is the whole cast and characters were back that they had yet another adventure
[01:20:46.340 --> 01:20:53.220]   But i'm hoping that a lot more creative types bring their projects to this sort of model because it would mean that we're no longer
[01:20:53.220 --> 01:20:56.260]   Subject to the vagaries and whims of mainstream
[01:20:56.260 --> 01:21:01.460]   Broadcast networks which allow really weird shows to continue and fan favorites to die
[01:21:01.620 --> 01:21:07.940]   Warner's gotten a little trouble when they first released it to the kickstarter fans because they did an ultraviolet version for the kickstarter fans
[01:21:07.940 --> 01:21:10.340]   People said
[01:21:10.340 --> 01:21:12.340]   So they do this
[01:21:12.340 --> 01:21:16.500]   It's ultraviolet is is is an industry technology and that should tell you a lot about it
[01:21:16.500 --> 01:21:20.580]   Yeah, whenever an industry tries to make a technology you have to go sign up for an ultraviolet account
[01:21:20.580 --> 01:21:22.580]   Then you have to find an ultraviolet provider
[01:21:22.580 --> 01:21:26.020]   A lot of technological people live tweeted trying to do it
[01:21:26.020 --> 01:21:28.660]   And if they could if they had trouble doing it, I can only imagine
[01:21:29.140 --> 01:21:31.220]   Our civilian friends and relatives trying
[01:21:31.220 --> 01:21:36.420]   But also it's it was hard to do for people who use the apple ecosystem
[01:21:36.420 --> 01:21:40.340]   You could get them on iOS apps, but they didn't enable air player airplane mirroring
[01:21:40.340 --> 01:21:44.820]   So you couldn't beam it to your apple tv and there's no ultraviolet app for the apple tv yet
[01:21:44.820 --> 01:21:48.420]   So it was just a really cludgy experience. I backed it on kickstarter
[01:21:48.420 --> 01:21:50.820]   I bought a ticket for the premiere and I bought it on itunes
[01:21:50.820 --> 01:21:54.180]   But most people they just want they just want to get it the way they originally paid
[01:21:54.740 --> 01:21:59.380]   Well and and as uh as rob himself said it doesn't seem fair
[01:21:59.380 --> 01:22:04.260]   Uh that if you paid for a copy of the movie a year ago if you were a backer on kickstarter
[01:22:04.260 --> 01:22:07.380]   That you have less choice than people who decide to buy it today
[01:22:07.380 --> 01:22:12.180]   Uh and wonder brothers owns part of ultraviolet. Yeah, surprise. They went with that
[01:22:12.180 --> 01:22:14.260]   Warner brothers did offer to refund
[01:22:14.260 --> 01:22:16.500]   Kickstarter backers for the price of a film
[01:22:16.500 --> 01:22:18.980]   Uh
[01:22:18.980 --> 01:22:21.620]   So now I have never seen that I love christen bell
[01:22:21.940 --> 01:22:25.620]   Uh, I think she's fabulous, but I've never saw the tv show would I enjoy the movie
[01:22:25.620 --> 01:22:27.940]   If you it is buffy without vampire
[01:22:27.940 --> 01:22:32.580]   So if you enjoy that sort of really strong female lead character very smart dialogue very witty
[01:22:32.580 --> 01:22:36.900]   Um, you know, it's a typical murder mystery sort of a structure, but it's got a lot of
[01:22:36.900 --> 01:22:42.420]   Young I would call it t-nanks in the original show, but now she's in your 20s and in law school. So yeah
[01:22:42.420 --> 01:22:45.220]   Young person angst. Yeah
[01:22:45.220 --> 01:22:50.180]   Shabey, but I love the way it's it's apparently apparently a successful opening weekend theatrically
[01:22:50.820 --> 01:22:56.660]   Well a little slow, um, but uh, they made two million dollars at the box office
[01:22:56.660 --> 01:23:02.340]   Um, and uh, rob tomas is already talking sequel. So I think they feel like it's a success
[01:23:02.340 --> 01:23:06.980]   Um, it did cast cost more than two million to make but it's not over yet
[01:23:06.980 --> 01:23:10.660]   Well, and they got the kickstarter backing, but I again I just I like this model
[01:23:10.660 --> 01:23:14.340]   I like that joss Whedon or somebody else someone else is a passionate creator could go through this
[01:23:14.340 --> 01:23:17.140]   Yep. Yep
[01:23:17.380 --> 01:23:20.900]   Mr. Andy and not co your pick of the week. I got two quick picks
[01:23:20.900 --> 01:23:29.380]   Because Renee Renee decided to go into the into the performing arts with one that decided to uh also mentioned diana domraff forever
[01:23:29.380 --> 01:23:33.860]   Which has been married to her is she your secret girlfriend? I just I just
[01:23:33.860 --> 01:23:37.220]   She's she's she's my favorite soprano. She has that
[01:23:37.220 --> 01:23:41.060]   uh, there's there's a lot of opera music I didn't get into because
[01:23:42.340 --> 01:23:48.180]   Performers who had this really just to me just an obnoxious style that wasn't really very humanistic
[01:23:48.180 --> 01:23:53.860]   There wasn't a lot of acting a lot of performance in it and then the first time I heard heard her in a performance like, okay
[01:23:53.860 --> 01:23:56.580]   Let's see what else she's recorded. Uh great. This is a great cd
[01:23:56.580 --> 01:24:01.700]   It's uh one third is like recital pieces the other two thirds are like broadway and movie musical
[01:24:01.700 --> 01:24:08.660]   Uh tracks which is often off putting for an opera singer because as a kid my parents had the plistido domingo like pop album
[01:24:08.660 --> 01:24:11.060]   Which was
[01:24:11.700 --> 01:24:14.420]   Tonight. Yeah, I don't want that. Yeah
[01:24:14.420 --> 01:24:20.180]   And so she basically shows what if what if you have someone who go where piles sings my fair lady
[01:24:20.180 --> 01:24:24.340]   Exactly. Yeah, so this so when she sings the these these songs
[01:24:24.340 --> 01:24:29.460]   It's more like she adapts her style to make it suitable for exactly perfect for this sort of stuff
[01:24:29.460 --> 01:24:32.180]   It's been available in the UK since the since october of course
[01:24:32.180 --> 01:24:34.020]   I special ordered it in the fall
[01:24:34.020 --> 01:24:38.660]   Finally available in the us on the itunes store and now as a cd on amazon as of last week
[01:24:38.900 --> 01:24:43.780]   Uh good good stuff again if you're not if you're not even if you're not into opera if you just like good vocalist
[01:24:43.780 --> 01:24:48.820]   I think you will really enjoy that but the more conventional thing is I have become sort of nuts for
[01:24:48.820 --> 01:24:52.180]   Domke's uh hardware wraps dio nke
[01:24:52.180 --> 01:24:56.820]   These are like you've seen cases that are designed to form fit a
[01:24:56.820 --> 01:24:59.700]   They're they're they're they're laptop sleeves or it's an ipod
[01:24:59.700 --> 01:25:04.340]   iPhone case or it's a camera bag or something where it's a form fitted and has a latch and stuff like this
[01:25:04.740 --> 01:25:11.060]   These are what what these wraps are is that it's just simply a rectangle of
[01:25:11.060 --> 01:25:15.140]   Fabric that is velcro velcro
[01:25:15.140 --> 01:25:17.940]   Affinity your cod piece. What is that?
[01:25:17.940 --> 01:25:20.100]   Oh, it's like a diaper. So so
[01:25:20.100 --> 01:25:24.660]   What the so the deal is that you can basically create a case for anything that you want
[01:25:24.660 --> 01:25:28.340]   So for instance, I've got my my new uh my new camera
[01:25:28.340 --> 01:25:29.700]   and
[01:25:29.700 --> 01:25:31.700]   Now I can simply unwrap this
[01:25:32.900 --> 01:25:38.660]   And there it is. So if I want to just carry this around like in my my shoulder bag and not get it scratched and dinged
[01:25:38.660 --> 01:25:42.500]   I've got something that fits the thing perfectly and doesn't take up too much space
[01:25:42.500 --> 01:25:49.460]   And I still have this square of wrap that I can then use for pretty much anything else that i'm traveling with
[01:25:49.460 --> 01:25:53.620]   So it's adaptable. So if you so if you so if I fly out with this wrapped around my camera
[01:25:53.620 --> 01:25:56.980]   But then I need to repack something and there's something that I was gonna carry
[01:25:56.980 --> 01:26:00.420]   Uh, uh, I'm my side back that needs to be packed inside my bag
[01:26:00.420 --> 01:26:03.540]   I can use that to wrap something else and they're really really versatile
[01:26:03.540 --> 01:26:09.380]   I bought one for believe it or not just a camera lens and then wound up like buying every size that they had
[01:26:09.380 --> 01:26:11.860]   And by accident finding it
[01:26:11.860 --> 01:26:16.660]   And by accident finding
[01:26:16.660 --> 01:26:21.300]   For now at least my favorite 13 inch laptop sleeve, which is just this thing right here
[01:26:21.300 --> 01:26:26.100]   It is just a 90 all it is is a 19 inch version of that wrap
[01:26:26.740 --> 01:26:31.380]   But you simply velcro this up and now you've got a plain simple envelope that fits it perfectly
[01:26:31.380 --> 01:26:33.780]   I've been absolutely stymied
[01:26:33.780 --> 01:26:40.260]   It sounds too. It sounds OCD, but believe it or not ever since I got this 13 inch notebook
[01:26:40.260 --> 01:26:44.740]   I have been absolutely stymie trying to find a sleeve that actually fit it
[01:26:44.740 --> 01:26:48.980]   I don't want to sleeve that almost fits it. I don't want to sleeve that's too big for it
[01:26:48.980 --> 01:26:55.300]   But you can get it inside there. I want something that will fit it perfectly so that when I stick it in my 13 inch laptop bag
[01:26:55.620 --> 01:27:01.380]   It's not I can I don't have to like fold this notebook in half so that it actually so it and the sleeve actually fits into it
[01:27:01.380 --> 01:27:05.460]   So this will because I can adjust the fit perfectly. It fits perfectly
[01:27:05.460 --> 01:27:09.300]   It doesn't matter that I have like a usb drive plugged into one of the ports
[01:27:09.300 --> 01:27:15.860]   And it works just great and they're dirt cheap. They're like but they're they're like 10 to 15 or 17 dollars each
[01:27:15.860 --> 01:27:19.140]   And like I said, I've just been I bought a bunch of them because
[01:27:19.140 --> 01:27:25.380]   Now when I pack for a trip, basically anything that needs a little bit of padding now is wrapped in one of these because
[01:27:25.780 --> 01:27:30.020]   I got a different color for everything. They're cheap. They work and they're highly highly adaptable
[01:27:30.020 --> 01:27:32.740]   And in the film industry those are called c48s. Did you know that?
[01:27:32.740 --> 01:27:36.260]   Diapers for your iPhone. Yeah
[01:27:36.260 --> 01:27:40.100]   And I give it a second that I have a lot of those. Do you use those too? Yeah, all right
[01:27:40.100 --> 01:27:45.140]   Yeah, I got I got I bought the same thing with Andy. I bought one and then I bought a lot of them
[01:27:45.140 --> 01:27:51.940]   Like this is amazing because we have all these different we have all this because I was literally gonna have people start making them for us and
[01:27:52.660 --> 01:27:55.380]   And so I haven't shared them with most of the company yet
[01:27:55.380 --> 01:27:59.140]   They're still using the old cases because I've been testing them because I want to make sure that I like them
[01:27:59.140 --> 01:28:04.500]   But I have I don't a bunch of them now and and I really what's great about them is is they're durable
[01:28:04.500 --> 01:28:09.540]   There they do exactly what the neoprene bags did except that one of them can fit a bunch of different sizes
[01:28:09.540 --> 01:28:14.420]   You don't have what exactly what Andy was saying. It's just they're great wraps if you're thinking about that for lenses or
[01:28:14.420 --> 01:28:18.500]   For me all my little hardware components that I'm trying to fit into a 1510
[01:28:18.500 --> 01:28:21.460]   I think Johnny I would hate these
[01:28:21.460 --> 01:28:23.460]   You're making my value
[01:28:23.460 --> 01:28:28.260]   Just would hate them why you want a perfectly fitted
[01:28:28.260 --> 01:28:35.780]   Case for your device made for it to be inevitable. Yeah, it had to be this way
[01:28:35.780 --> 01:28:40.900]   His team would do a version of it. It would also be velcro but they would make no sound when you pull it apart
[01:28:40.900 --> 01:28:43.220]   silent
[01:28:43.220 --> 01:28:49.780]   I have too many picks. Uh, I was hoping one of you would mention microsoft one note now available for free on the Macintosh
[01:28:50.580 --> 01:28:52.580]   Uh, they've had web versions for some time
[01:28:52.580 --> 01:28:59.700]   Um, it is you know, I would guess for some people who use one note in business or at the office
[01:28:59.700 --> 01:29:05.140]   They will really like it. It's a note taking application. I'm full screen on it with the patented
[01:29:05.140 --> 01:29:07.940]   Microsoft ribbon toolbar, which I think a lot of
[01:29:07.940 --> 01:29:13.460]   Mac users hate if they had charged 20 bucks for this I would not recommend it
[01:29:13.460 --> 01:29:17.460]   But the fact that it's free and some of you may actually already be using one note
[01:29:18.020 --> 01:29:21.140]   Um to share in fact we use it on the show to share
[01:29:21.140 --> 01:29:28.100]   Uh notes from windows weekly because they're all windows users the fact that it's on the app store and it's free makes it worthwhile
[01:29:28.100 --> 01:29:32.420]   Oh wait microsoft stock going up today on the rumors that microsoft is
[01:29:32.420 --> 01:29:34.980]   imminently gonna release
[01:29:34.980 --> 01:29:36.980]   Office for the ipad
[01:29:36.980 --> 01:29:41.220]   They have a big media event next week. I think within first first little event with a new ceo
[01:29:41.220 --> 01:29:43.780]   Yeah, so yeah, and uh
[01:29:43.780 --> 01:29:46.260]   I one off of the ipad and i fun have been out for some time
[01:29:46.820 --> 01:29:48.820]   So one note is kind of like ever note
[01:29:48.820 --> 01:29:52.980]   Uh, it is at least cross platform if you're if you're a big office user
[01:29:52.980 --> 01:29:54.580]   Um
[01:29:54.580 --> 01:29:58.020]   This is probably something at least worth downloading and taking a look at the other thing
[01:29:58.020 --> 01:30:01.220]   I'll just do a quick mention of because i'm gonna review it on before you buy
[01:30:01.220 --> 01:30:06.180]   In just a little bit, but I finally you know, I was I've been looking for now that I have a
[01:30:06.180 --> 01:30:10.020]   ridiculously expensive mac pro i've been looking for thunderbolt to
[01:30:10.020 --> 01:30:12.980]   peripherals and particularly a thunderbolt
[01:30:13.780 --> 01:30:20.100]   to uh hard drive because the internal drive I only got 500 gigs internal drive on the mac and I pretty much filled it up
[01:30:20.100 --> 01:30:23.060]   I don't have enough room for the operating system the apps and the data
[01:30:23.060 --> 01:30:29.460]   So I needed a fast external drive. Let's see had been promising this little big disc for some time
[01:30:29.460 --> 01:30:34.260]   They they've been making a little big disc for a while, but this is a thunderbolt to native thunderbolt to
[01:30:34.260 --> 01:30:35.460]   um
[01:30:35.460 --> 01:30:39.700]   Enclosure for dual ssd's they can be in raid zero
[01:30:40.260 --> 01:30:43.300]   uh raid one which of course cuts the capacity in half
[01:30:43.300 --> 01:30:49.140]   Or uh jbod just a big old disc mode or just a bunch of discs sometimes
[01:30:49.140 --> 01:30:50.660]   Um
[01:30:50.660 --> 01:30:54.420]   But this is a terabyte very expensive 1299, but I gotta tell you fast
[01:30:54.420 --> 01:31:00.660]   So fast that's actually faster than the ssd inside this macbook retin i have the 2012 retina in front of me
[01:31:00.660 --> 01:31:02.820]   And it's like half the speed
[01:31:02.820 --> 01:31:09.460]   Uh over thunderbolt one when you're using this on a mac pro it is fast enough to do 4k video editing
[01:31:10.020 --> 01:31:12.020]   and ingesting and uh
[01:31:12.020 --> 01:31:17.300]   Playback so it's very very fast. That's who this is for but of course if you own a mac pro
[01:31:17.300 --> 01:31:20.020]   Obviously money doesn't matter
[01:31:20.020 --> 01:31:24.020]   So like gasoline and the lambo. Yeah, but it's beautiful and it's little
[01:31:24.020 --> 01:31:29.780]   It's uh, what did you say? I mean it's like the size of two decks of cards. It's it's surprisingly small
[01:31:29.780 --> 01:31:35.300]   Really like it looks like an e-cigarette. Yeah, it's from vapin right now
[01:31:35.300 --> 01:31:39.780]   Uh, so that's the little big disc a full review coming up on them before you buy in just a little bit
[01:31:40.180 --> 01:31:41.940]   a couple of tips
[01:31:41.940 --> 01:31:44.420]   For you it is very very very fast
[01:31:44.420 --> 01:31:49.780]   Uh, thank you. Andy nako chicago sun times. We love you. We love your clock
[01:31:49.780 --> 01:31:54.420]   And we hope you have a return and the the clock has no opinion being an admin object
[01:31:54.420 --> 01:31:57.620]   But it has a style and an elegance that be fits his presence here on a twit
[01:31:57.620 --> 01:32:00.500]   I've been loving your olympus pictures your md m
[01:32:00.500 --> 01:32:07.220]   One pictures i'm loving that that's if i can make it i could i've got at least three picks of the week worth of love for this camera
[01:32:07.380 --> 01:32:09.940]   Yeah, i'm very very nice and uh
[01:32:09.940 --> 01:32:14.660]   And uh, we love the images see we get the benefit of it because we get see all those nice pictures
[01:32:14.660 --> 01:32:17.300]   Where's the best place to follow your pictures google plus?
[01:32:17.300 --> 01:32:22.740]   Uh flicker really that's where that's where i like to like photo blog although
[01:32:22.740 --> 01:32:30.580]   They're doing a big site redesign. Yeah, I might make it harder for i like i like posting a photo and then having a few paragraphs about the photo
[01:32:30.580 --> 01:32:35.460]   And so i might i'm doing a redesign of my blog that might take that stuff back to my blog
[01:32:35.540 --> 01:32:39.860]   But flicker is use it flicker is my public backup of photos that i really really like
[01:32:39.860 --> 01:32:44.500]   And uh, he's andi on flicker if you want to follow him there and a lot of waterlogged
[01:32:44.500 --> 01:32:48.660]   Stuff really enjoying that my review is coming to our i
[01:32:48.660 --> 01:32:52.580]   I wrote the review that it turned into a bigger essay on
[01:32:52.580 --> 01:32:57.220]   On the app and other things and then oh, let's see if it'll work with this. Oh, let's see work with this
[01:32:57.220 --> 01:33:02.980]   But i realized oh, didn't you mean to publish this a week from yesterday? Yeah, you did. Okay, you can't stop waterlogging
[01:33:02.980 --> 01:33:07.860]   I'm not i'm not saying that's a bad thing any i'm just taking note of the fact that we did plan on publishing this a week from yesterday
[01:33:07.860 --> 01:33:10.260]   I've been playing with it as well and I and I just love it
[01:33:10.260 --> 01:33:13.700]   I think it really does something with these images that are just uh, it's just gorgeous
[01:33:13.700 --> 01:33:17.940]   And what's what I think is interesting is that it doesn't it takes images that weren't that good
[01:33:17.940 --> 01:33:24.100]   as photos and uh and and makes them actually these there's something about them and and
[01:33:24.100 --> 01:33:30.580]   I've learned I mean i'm using it almost every day like anytime waiting for something or online i'm like, oh, this is not a photo that i'm gonna try to waterlog
[01:33:31.060 --> 01:33:39.140]   And um, it's yeah wow there's video. I got video behind me now. Um, uh, anyway, so the um, it's uh, it's fantastic
[01:33:39.140 --> 01:33:42.340]   These are amazing images and yeah really yeah, joy him
[01:33:42.340 --> 01:33:47.940]   He's a water colorist. I could just see you sitting there in your beret with your easel
[01:33:47.940 --> 01:33:53.620]   I I can't you know, I I was thinking about this and this is like a something i put into the the essay
[01:33:53.620 --> 01:33:58.500]   I'm thinking that how cheesed off with like local artists being if i print it up like i have those
[01:33:59.060 --> 01:34:02.020]   And hung them up like a local copy shop for like 75
[01:34:02.020 --> 01:34:06.740]   And how fast would they sell compared to but I I studied for like eight years
[01:34:06.740 --> 01:34:10.740]   They took me three months to do that one and it's been there for like a year and a half
