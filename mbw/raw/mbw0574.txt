[00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:38.200]   the latest news from Apple.
[00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:40.200]   And there's big news afoot.
[00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.200]   Ritchie is here from imore.com.
[00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:46.200]   Ready, you're Leo Ship.
[00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.200]   Geeks, assemble!
[00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.200]   Also with us from the Chicago Suntimes Andy in Notco.
[00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:58.200]   Luke, you and the three of us, of the three of us.
[00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.200]   Only one has clean glasses.
[00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.200]   No, only one.
[00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:04.200]   Only one.
[00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.200]   Put your glasses back on, Clark Kent.
[00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:13.200]   Only one is going to be at in Cupertino on, yeah, you showed,
[00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:14.200]   you showed, you're picking it.
[00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:15.200]   I'm taking one for the team, Leo.
[00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:16.200]   I'm taking one for the team, Leo.
[00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:17.200]   I'm taking one for the team.
[00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:21.200]   You're the guy who has to go in and take point at the Steve Jobs
[00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:25.200]   Theater, 10 a.m. Pacific, September 12th, one week from today.
[00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:26.200]   Yes, sir.
[00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:27.200]   Are you excited?
[00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:30.200]   I never, I can never get excited about these things.
[00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:33.200]   It's that weird feeling where there's just so much to do that
[00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:35.200]   I'll be in pure stress mode until the event.
[00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:39.200]   It's like after the event has happened, I'll be retroactively excited.
[00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:42.200]   But it's just, it's like work, work, work, work, work.
[00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:44.200]   So it's a terrible answer.
[00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:46.200]   And Georgia yelled at me for giving that answer.
[00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:48.200]   But for me, it's just like, ahh, so many things to do.
[00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:51.200]   But I haven't said it.
[00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:52.200]   Yeah, because you're going to, so what will you, what will your
[00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:54.200]   workload look like?
[00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:56.200]   So we have to get a ton of stuff for that.
[00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:57.200]   Go through all these previews for what's going to happen.
[00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:59.200]   We're already doing all the how to's for iOS 11 and all the other
[00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:01.200]   operating systems.
[00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:03.200]   We want to go in there with some semblance of a plan.
[00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:05.200]   Like if Apple releases ABCD, what are we going to do?
[00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:07.200]   What video do we need?
[00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:08.200]   What articles we need to cover?
[00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:10.200]   How's like, what are the pre-orders going to look like the
[00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:11.200]   orders?
[00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:12.200]   How do we help people choose the right one?
[00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:16.200]   And luckily, Trinity and Lori Gill are managing most of that this year.
[00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:18.200]   So who's going in with you?
[00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:21.200]   So, Trinity, certainly myself are going to be in there.
[00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:22.200]   Okay.
[00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:25.200]   But, but I mean, it is as you, as you gave us a hint, it's a
[00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:28.200]   massive undertaking for a publication like I'm more than just
[00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:31.200]   wants to be wall to wall coverage of all the announcements.
[00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:35.200]   Yeah, I mean, I, I, I sort of John and Jim just kind of walk in
[00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:37.200]   there with, they're either their iPhone or their notepad and
[00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:39.200]   watch and scroll down a few notes.
[00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:41.200]   And I'm always so jealous.
[00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:42.200]   Yeah.
[00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:44.200]   That will be one day I can get there.
[00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:46.200]   Life is easy for the boss.
[00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:48.200]   Well, Andy and I will be here.
[00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:50.200]   Actually, I will be here with Renee.
[00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:55.200]   I'm sorry with Megan Moroni and Alex Lindsay.
[00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:58.200]   The three of us will cover the event 10 a.m.
[00:03:58.200 --> 00:03:59.200]   Pacific as I mentioned.
[00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:02.200]   That's 1 p.m. Eastern 1700 UTC a week from today.
[00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:06.200]   Backbreak weekly will be delayed by however much the event delays
[00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:07.200]   us.
[00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:11.200]   And then Andy and I and Alex will do back break weekly and maybe
[00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:13.200]   Renee, if we can figure it out.
[00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:14.200]   Yeah.
[00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:16.200]   You're expecting though a demo room after the keynote.
[00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:17.200]   Yeah.
[00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:20.200]   So usually it's like a two hour keynote and then it's usually,
[00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:23.200]   the demo theoretically doesn't take long, but when you have that
[00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:26.200]   many people crowding around those few tables, it can take two
[00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:28.200]   hours just to get in and see everything.
[00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:29.200]   Wow.
[00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:30.200]   So you'll be busy basically.
[00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:31.200]   Yeah.
[00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:33.200]   But we'll get you, we'll get you the following week.
[00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:34.200]   We'll get your questions.
[00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:35.200]   Absolutely.
[00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:36.200]   Absolutely.
[00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:38.200]   And that is one reason of course it's good to go is the demo
[00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:41.200]   room because that's the, that's the earliest exam, you know,
[00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:46.200]   chance you'll have to probably touch the three new iPhones,
[00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:48.920]   the seven S, seven S plus.
[00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:50.200]   Are we saying iPhone eight now?
[00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:52.200]   Everybody seems to be saying iPhone eight, which I don't think
[00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:53.200]   is going to be the name.
[00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:56.200]   I mean, like again, like there is nothing precious about this.
[00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:58.200]   At some point, somebody, I don't know, maybe it's Jaws or
[00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:00.200]   Phil or someone walks in and types a few things out and then
[00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:02.200]   everything goes out, but they can name it and they can name it
[00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:04.200]   a iPhone Rudolph if they want to.
[00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:08.200]   There is no, as we've seen with the new iPad, there's, there's
[00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:10.200]   nothing stopping them from doing whatever they currently
[00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:11.200]   are.
[00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:12.200]   I think it's a great thing.
[00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:13.200]   I think it's a great thing.
[00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:14.200]   I think it's a great thing.
[00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:15.200]   I think it's a great thing.
[00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:16.200]   I think it's a great thing.
[00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:17.200]   I think it's a great thing.
[00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:18.200]   I think it's a great thing.
[00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:19.200]   I think it's a great thing.
[00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:20.200]   I think it's a great thing.
[00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:21.200]   I think it's a great thing.
[00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:22.200]   I think it's a great thing.
[00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:23.200]   I think it's a great thing.
[00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:24.200]   I think it's a great thing.
[00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:25.200]   I think it's a great thing.
[00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:26.200]   I think it's a great thing.
[00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:27.200]   I think it's a great thing.
[00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:28.200]   I think it's a great thing.
[00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:29.200]   I think it's a great thing.
[00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:30.200]   I think it's a great thing.
[00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:31.200]   I think it's a great thing.
[00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:32.200]   I think it's a great thing.
[00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:39.200]   I think it's a great thing.
[00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:46.200]   I think it's a great thing.
[00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:47.200]   I think it's a great thing.
[00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:48.200]   I think it's a great thing.
[00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:49.200]   I think it's a great thing.
[00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:50.200]   I think it's a great thing.
[00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:51.200]   I think it's a great thing.
[00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:52.200]   I think it's a great thing.
[00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:53.200]   I think it's a great thing.
[00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:54.200]   I think it's a great thing.
[00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:55.200]   I think it's a great thing.
[00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:56.200]   I think it's a great thing.
[00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:57.200]   I think it's a great thing.
[00:05:57.200 --> 00:05:58.200]   I think it's a great thing.
[00:05:58.200 --> 00:05:59.200]   I think it's a great thing.
[00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:00.200]   I think it's a great thing.
[00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:06.200]   It's interesting to think about how they can price this thing anyway because if you're
[00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:09.920]   already saying that this is going to be, if it's true, that's going to be no less than
[00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:15.840]   a thousand bucks, can Apple get away with being such a stinking cheapskate to say that,
[00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:17.200]   no, we're not going to give you 128 gigs.
[00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:23.400]   We're going to give you 64, which is kind of a, which is fine, but not an impressive amount
[00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:24.480]   of memory.
[00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:28.400]   I mean, I hope they should at least include a charger, let's say.
[00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:31.400]   If they don't include a charger, then that's a problem.
[00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:32.400]   Yeah.
[00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:33.400]   That one's a charger.
[00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:40.440]   I'm joking, but it's sort of like how there was a disconnect when Apple was trying to
[00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:47.120]   sell a $12,000 solid gold watch with a plastic band that was like, "I forgot, six.
[00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:48.360]   You can afford leather.
[00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:51.960]   I've got a $250 watch that has a beautiful leather band."
[00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:52.960]   Yeah.
[00:06:52.960 --> 00:07:00.760]   All right, I don't know if, I think we need not go through the laundry list of things.
[00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:03.760]   I am curious to Renee in your battle plans.
[00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:04.760]   Yes.
[00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:07.680]   What are the long shots that you're planning for?
[00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:09.460]   So this two-
[00:07:09.460 --> 00:07:11.360]   Unworldly things, you know?
[00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:13.400]   I don't think there are too many unlikely things.
[00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:17.480]   So for example, if it was an iPad event, we'd plan for like an Apple pencil to maybe
[00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:18.920]   showing up.
[00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:22.800]   Some people have asked about AirPods 2, but I think AirPods 1 are still, if they could
[00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:24.920]   somehow make them easier to produce.
[00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:28.840]   I could see a revision on them, but I don't think there's any next generation technology
[00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:29.840]   for that.
[00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:33.520]   I think they're going to stay away from Macs because traditionally they focus on iOS,
[00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:34.520]   the September event.
[00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:38.000]   So I think, you know, there may be a slide from iMac Pro, but I don't think we'll see
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.240]   Mac Mini or the modular Mac Pro or anything like that.
[00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:42.600]   I think they're going to really want to stay on story.
[00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:46.960]   So I think the only things, the hardest things to predict are the things that are completely
[00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:50.920]   internal projects like research kit and care kit, which are phenomenal.
[00:07:50.920 --> 00:07:54.320]   So not very mainstream, like they're not very mainstream exciting.
[00:07:54.320 --> 00:07:57.240]   People only see them when they're actually going to a hospital or going to a university
[00:07:57.240 --> 00:07:59.440]   center, but they really are fundamentally great technologies.
[00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:03.160]   And there could be some next version of that that nobody is predicting.
[00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:04.160]   Yeah.
[00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:08.520]   Also, if the rumors about the iPhone infinity are true, there's going to be a lot of stuff
[00:08:08.520 --> 00:08:10.760]   that they're really going to have a lot of bullet points.
[00:08:10.760 --> 00:08:13.760]   They're really going to have to cover in detail.
[00:08:13.760 --> 00:08:16.720]   They're going to have to put together a demo so that anybody who's watching this stream
[00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:20.440]   and all the journalists and all the analysts who aren't in Cupertino will, when they have
[00:08:20.440 --> 00:08:27.160]   to write their pieces that day, will understand, okay, it doesn't have fingerprint recognition,
[00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:28.680]   but that's okay.
[00:08:28.680 --> 00:08:32.200]   It doesn't have a home button, but that's okay.
[00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:34.200]   And they're really going to have to nail all those points.
[00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:40.360]   So I'd be very, very surprised if they, if they had anything that was not iOS, maybe
[00:08:40.360 --> 00:08:43.520]   a nod towards, oh, and by the way, here's an up one slide update.
[00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:44.960]   The iMac is still on board.
[00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:46.560]   We're still heading for that.
[00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:50.240]   I'd be surprised if they didn't talk about HomePod, but it really is going to be an
[00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:54.240]   iPhone infinity in fact.
[00:08:54.240 --> 00:08:59.200]   Pictures are coming up of the Steve Jobs Theater.
[00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:05.480]   This is from, it's kind of interesting, a Spanish language, Mac Magazine had these pictures
[00:09:05.480 --> 00:09:07.400]   apparently discovered in Google Maps.
[00:09:07.400 --> 00:09:11.040]   Somebody's been uploading to Google Maps.
[00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:12.920]   So we're getting images.
[00:09:12.920 --> 00:09:21.560]   And Neil Seibart tweeted based on the drawings that there is a demo area, right?
[00:09:21.560 --> 00:09:25.680]   And if it's a top floor, yeah, you'll have to walk through it.
[00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:27.880]   But maybe it'll be all covered in black when you go in.
[00:09:27.880 --> 00:09:30.920]   Oh, so they'll be assembling the products when we're downstairs.
[00:09:30.920 --> 00:09:34.400]   You think the demo area will be in the lobby, the upstairs lobby?
[00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:35.400]   Yeah.
[00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:36.400]   Interesting.
[00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:37.400]   Yeah.
[00:09:37.400 --> 00:09:39.880]   So it is a gallery space.
[00:09:39.880 --> 00:09:44.400]   So this is the only part you see above ground.
[00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:48.400]   That's the round world's largest carbon fiber roof.
[00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:49.800]   And this is glass all around.
[00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:51.920]   So I mean, there's no hide in what's inside.
[00:09:51.920 --> 00:09:54.320]   I mean, if somebody sends a drone over, they're going to see.
[00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:57.640]   So yeah, cover it with, actually that'd be exciting when it for the press arriving.
[00:09:57.640 --> 00:09:58.640]   They'll go there.
[00:09:58.640 --> 00:10:00.360]   They'll get their badges here.
[00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:05.680]   They'll have their traditional crawler and cup of coffee and then descend the escalators
[00:10:05.680 --> 00:10:06.680]   down.
[00:10:06.680 --> 00:10:09.680]   And send the quarterback's in on the way.
[00:10:09.680 --> 00:10:11.080]   Notice this, notice this here.
[00:10:11.080 --> 00:10:12.280]   Let me see if I can get this any bigger.
[00:10:12.280 --> 00:10:15.880]   This says exhibit space right here underneath, underneath.
[00:10:15.880 --> 00:10:19.120]   So it's like G.I. Joe's secret headquarters.
[00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:20.120]   It does.
[00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:21.360]   Temporary space storage.
[00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:22.640]   You'll walk.
[00:10:22.640 --> 00:10:23.640]   This is really cool.
[00:10:23.640 --> 00:10:24.640]   You're going to walk in.
[00:10:24.640 --> 00:10:26.600]   The auditorium doors are here.
[00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:31.520]   This is the, this is the, the stage area is just a slice here.
[00:10:31.520 --> 00:10:35.080]   This look at how much backstage and loading dock area there is.
[00:10:35.080 --> 00:10:38.560]   And loading dock must have a big elevator because it's underground.
[00:10:38.560 --> 00:10:41.560]   Everything's underground except for the lobby.
[00:10:41.560 --> 00:10:45.200]   So the loading dock has an elevator, obviously.
[00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:48.520]   The backstage is as big as the theater.
[00:10:48.520 --> 00:10:51.720]   The backstage is massive.
[00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:55.560]   And of course, because that's where the executives are.
[00:10:55.560 --> 00:10:56.560]   That's where they're staging everything.
[00:10:56.560 --> 00:10:59.640]   They have a secret entrance in the back that goes right from there.
[00:10:59.640 --> 00:11:02.360]   It doesn't, and the, I don't know where Neil got these, by the way.
[00:11:02.360 --> 00:11:03.360]   Do you know?
[00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:04.360]   I don't know.
[00:11:04.360 --> 00:11:05.360]   I don't know where he got these drawings.
[00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:06.680]   Maybe it's the city plans.
[00:11:06.680 --> 00:11:10.680]   Oh yeah, they would have to, wouldn't they, for permitting?
[00:11:10.680 --> 00:11:12.200]   And then let's see.
[00:11:12.200 --> 00:11:14.400]   So this is the theater here.
[00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:19.800]   They've got stadium seating in the back.
[00:11:19.800 --> 00:11:23.840]   This says here, it says mech area underneath.
[00:11:23.840 --> 00:11:28.080]   So well, they keep the mech up the mech.
[00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:30.280]   If you don't like it, the mecca are under here.
[00:11:30.280 --> 00:11:31.280]   Just remember.
[00:11:31.280 --> 00:11:32.280]   Ed 209, right?
[00:11:32.280 --> 00:11:34.120]   It didn't go Ed 209 bad.
[00:11:34.120 --> 00:11:37.560]   This is kind of, I mean, this is really evil genius material here.
[00:11:37.560 --> 00:11:38.560]   This is the underground layer.
[00:11:38.560 --> 00:11:39.560]   Well, that was the big thing.
[00:11:39.560 --> 00:11:41.800]   I was like, are they going to get us all in there and then just flood it?
[00:11:41.800 --> 00:11:44.240]   Say we're tired of you people and then just flood the whole thing.
[00:11:44.240 --> 00:11:47.640]   Andy, I think you and I lucked out on this one.
[00:11:47.640 --> 00:11:51.080]   Here's a, here's a cross section from an aerial cross section.
[00:11:51.080 --> 00:11:53.080]   It gives you a better idea.
[00:11:53.080 --> 00:11:54.360]   This is the stage area.
[00:11:54.360 --> 00:11:56.320]   All of this is backstage.
[00:11:56.320 --> 00:11:57.760]   Yeah.
[00:11:57.760 --> 00:12:00.640]   But realize that they are building a theater.
[00:12:00.640 --> 00:12:05.640]   It's not a place they built specifically to give product demos.
[00:12:05.640 --> 00:12:09.120]   Oh, though again, well, what else do they have here, plays?
[00:12:09.120 --> 00:12:14.000]   Well, remember there's, well, they could remember that this isn't something that, again,
[00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:15.000]   this isn't rental space.
[00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:16.680]   They're not going to be there for five years.
[00:12:16.680 --> 00:12:19.920]   They're going to be there for 10, 20, 30, 40 years.
[00:12:19.920 --> 00:12:23.360]   And the, what they're putting, this is the one space you can get to without having to
[00:12:23.360 --> 00:12:25.560]   pass through Apple security.
[00:12:25.560 --> 00:12:29.880]   And there are a lot of companies in the area actually everywhere where they do have, they
[00:12:29.880 --> 00:12:35.600]   did need a big presentation space, but they can also do things like rent it out for functions
[00:12:35.600 --> 00:12:39.480]   or if there's a function that they're doing where they just, they want to host like an
[00:12:39.480 --> 00:12:44.800]   academy screening or they're, there is just some sort of a speaker that they really like
[00:12:44.800 --> 00:12:46.920]   and they really, really endorse.
[00:12:46.920 --> 00:12:54.880]   They can have it in this is, this is the ultimate case of renovating your building and thinking
[00:12:54.880 --> 00:12:58.440]   that all I want to do with the kitchen is getting new appliances.
[00:12:58.440 --> 00:13:00.920]   But then you thinking, well, look, I'm not going to be able to renovate the house for
[00:13:00.920 --> 00:13:02.120]   another 10 or 20 years.
[00:13:02.120 --> 00:13:04.360]   This is probably the last time I'm going to do this.
[00:13:04.360 --> 00:13:09.520]   Maybe I should pay the extra $15,000 to have a solarium attached to the kitchen and then
[00:13:09.520 --> 00:13:11.760]   a conversation area attached to that.
[00:13:11.760 --> 00:13:15.160]   I, I, when I see things like that in the backstage area, I'm thinking that this looks
[00:13:15.160 --> 00:13:20.480]   typical for a real theater where if you want to do live presentations, you need to have
[00:13:20.480 --> 00:13:23.560]   a wide backstage that can handle pretty much anything.
[00:13:23.560 --> 00:13:26.160]   And that's, I've been saying for the past year or two since we've been talking about
[00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:31.160]   this new thing, that this is a, this is also a theater that was designed specifically to
[00:13:31.160 --> 00:13:35.640]   get to host this sort of event particularly well.
[00:13:35.640 --> 00:13:39.680]   So I've absolutely no doubt that there is, it was designed with the idea that there is
[00:13:39.680 --> 00:13:44.640]   a demo area that can be not just blocked off, but pretty much invisible to people who are
[00:13:44.640 --> 00:13:46.680]   coming in at the start of the event.
[00:13:46.680 --> 00:13:52.680]   Or if they want to do something in the, in the atrium area, a easy ability to quickly
[00:13:52.680 --> 00:13:56.000]   do a load in, in that area over the course of an hour.
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:02.920]   So it's, it's, it's, it's like when you, yeah, there's, this is, this is a tuxedo that was
[00:14:02.920 --> 00:14:04.560]   built for a magician.
[00:14:04.560 --> 00:14:08.520]   There are going to be all kinds of hidden pouches and double linings that you don't,
[00:14:08.520 --> 00:14:11.800]   wouldn't be in anything else but are exactly for the sort of act that Apple wants to pull
[00:14:11.800 --> 00:14:13.960]   off is it's going to be, it's going to be fun.
[00:14:13.960 --> 00:14:19.880]   If I were attending, I would be just as interested to document this thing looks like it's a wall,
[00:14:19.880 --> 00:14:21.280]   but it's probably not a wall.
[00:14:21.280 --> 00:14:25.720]   And oh, there's, I just saw somebody who was standing by this area and there wasn't a door
[00:14:25.720 --> 00:14:26.720]   there.
[00:14:26.720 --> 00:14:28.080]   And now they're not there anymore.
[00:14:28.080 --> 00:14:31.520]   This must be the place where people can quickly quickly slip out, take a phone call, then come
[00:14:31.520 --> 00:14:32.520]   back in again.
[00:14:32.520 --> 00:14:37.280]   So here's the, so this is a great tweet thread, by the way, Neil cyberdive from above Avalon
[00:14:37.280 --> 00:14:42.640]   has a lot of information here, meeting rooms, meeting room meeting room meeting room.
[00:14:42.640 --> 00:14:47.200]   This is, this says exhibit space, but when you look at the cross, the cross section, you
[00:14:47.200 --> 00:14:49.120]   see it says exhibit space down here.
[00:14:49.120 --> 00:14:53.360]   So I'm thinking that escalators come down and there's a large exhibit space that is
[00:14:53.360 --> 00:14:56.960]   not visible to the public here.
[00:14:56.960 --> 00:15:00.840]   He also says some other things quotes the San Jose Mercury news in an interview in the
[00:15:00.840 --> 00:15:12.080]   San Jose Mercury news that the theater costs $14,000 a seat according to somebody Borden
[00:15:12.080 --> 00:15:15.320]   that the, there's also a thousand seats.
[00:15:15.320 --> 00:15:20.360]   It says clearly on the plans here compared to 1600 at Bill Graham for iPhone events, but
[00:15:20.360 --> 00:15:25.960]   much bigger than urban, urban, Wayne of center, 760 and the Apple Town Hall 300.
[00:15:25.960 --> 00:15:28.760]   And that's the cool thing too, is like they used Apple Town Hall for a lot of things.
[00:15:28.760 --> 00:15:30.000]   It wasn't just for press meetings.
[00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:31.800]   It was for everyday company meetings.
[00:15:31.800 --> 00:15:32.800]   Yeah.
[00:15:32.800 --> 00:15:35.960]   I mean, I think that some of Apple University was there and they did a lot of meetups and
[00:15:35.960 --> 00:15:39.640]   some of the stuff they used to do in the center court of infinite loop, like when they had
[00:15:39.640 --> 00:15:43.480]   bigger meetings and they could at least stage quasi bigger meetings, like when they have
[00:15:43.480 --> 00:15:47.000]   disclosure meetings or they have meetings to show off new app, like things internally,
[00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:49.320]   projects that are done internally.
[00:15:49.320 --> 00:15:53.880]   And the really cool thing about all this too is that previously to Andy's point, they would
[00:15:53.880 --> 00:15:57.440]   spend like a million dollars to make a platform that rose up and turned around to show off
[00:15:57.440 --> 00:16:01.400]   the new iPhone and then have to throw it away or they would spend millions of dollars to
[00:16:01.400 --> 00:16:05.480]   bring air conditioning into Bill Graham and then have to basically scuttle all that money
[00:16:05.480 --> 00:16:10.360]   where here they can purpose build all of those displays and all of those mechanics exactly
[00:16:10.360 --> 00:16:11.640]   we wanted and then keep them.
[00:16:11.640 --> 00:16:12.640]   It'll save them money.
[00:16:12.640 --> 00:16:13.640]   I'm sure.
[00:16:13.640 --> 00:16:14.640]   I mean, this is what Apple's always wanted to do.
[00:16:14.640 --> 00:16:15.640]   I'm sure.
[00:16:15.640 --> 00:16:18.960]   Well, I think less than save the money, it gives them control and protection control over
[00:16:18.960 --> 00:16:19.960]   the environment.
[00:16:19.960 --> 00:16:20.960]   Yeah.
[00:16:20.960 --> 00:16:22.800]   And you don't have to announce what when your events are because you've got the theater
[00:16:22.800 --> 00:16:23.800]   booked privately.
[00:16:23.800 --> 00:16:24.800]   Yes.
[00:16:24.800 --> 00:16:26.600]   It removes the whole list of areas.
[00:16:26.600 --> 00:16:28.600]   You've got to bump any queue, but that's it.
[00:16:28.600 --> 00:16:33.120]   According to the EIR, this is Jack March tweeting, the environmental impact report says
[00:16:33.120 --> 00:16:37.440]   only 350 media will be invited to special events at the auditorium.
[00:16:37.440 --> 00:16:43.280]   And the reason that number probably is part of the EIR is for parking and transportation.
[00:16:43.280 --> 00:16:48.240]   But that would explain why that these tickets are in just as short supplies it would be
[00:16:48.240 --> 00:16:50.000]   as if you were having it at town hall.
[00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:51.800]   I mean, that's not a lot of people.
[00:16:51.800 --> 00:16:54.920]   It means that there will be 650 Apple employees.
[00:16:54.920 --> 00:16:55.920]   And if--
[00:16:55.920 --> 00:16:59.360]   Town Hall was 300, but there was 150 media typically.
[00:16:59.360 --> 00:17:01.280]   So it was typically half capacity.
[00:17:01.280 --> 00:17:05.000]   I would guess, frankly, that you would want a lot of employees in there.
[00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:09.240]   If you're streaming this live now, you're going to presume most of the press, like me
[00:17:09.240 --> 00:17:13.840]   and Andy, will be watching the stream and our friends at home.
[00:17:13.840 --> 00:17:20.360]   And that really what you want is a loud and appreciative audience.
[00:17:20.360 --> 00:17:21.360]   When I went to--
[00:17:21.360 --> 00:17:22.360]   Yeah, because we're too busy typing.
[00:17:22.360 --> 00:17:23.360]   We're too busy typing.
[00:17:23.360 --> 00:17:24.360]   Yeah, not applauding.
[00:17:24.360 --> 00:17:28.560]   When I went to see David Letterman, remember going and getting in line to see David Letterman
[00:17:28.560 --> 00:17:33.320]   and you line up as you know Andy, because you've done this ahead of time.
[00:17:33.320 --> 00:17:38.120]   The pages are going around-- or the audience coordinators are going around kind of finding
[00:17:38.120 --> 00:17:40.560]   the fun, happy, excited people.
[00:17:40.560 --> 00:17:42.240]   And if they see media, they recognize me.
[00:17:42.240 --> 00:17:43.240]   Which is amazing.
[00:17:43.240 --> 00:17:44.840]   And they said, oh, yeah, hi.
[00:17:44.840 --> 00:17:51.320]   And they put you in the back balcony, because what they want in the front rows is the people
[00:17:51.320 --> 00:17:54.200]   who are so excited to see Dave and cheering.
[00:17:54.200 --> 00:17:55.840]   And it would be the same here.
[00:17:55.840 --> 00:17:57.000]   This is a media event.
[00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:58.000]   This makes sense.
[00:17:58.000 --> 00:17:59.800]   Well, yeah, I mean, it is.
[00:17:59.800 --> 00:18:05.440]   This isn't like a Town Hall meeting where it's a public event and they're required to host
[00:18:05.440 --> 00:18:06.440]   a public--
[00:18:06.440 --> 00:18:07.440]   Exactly.
[00:18:07.440 --> 00:18:08.440]   There's a point to what they're doing here.
[00:18:08.440 --> 00:18:12.120]   And I think one of the reasons-- one of the many factors that I think factors into it
[00:18:12.120 --> 00:18:19.480]   is people who can take best advantage of the demo area, people who are going to come
[00:18:19.480 --> 00:18:25.320]   with the bane of my modern existence, the people who have that little skeleton rig with
[00:18:25.320 --> 00:18:28.200]   a phone and the blimp microphone and the--
[00:18:28.200 --> 00:18:29.360]   Live on Facebook.
[00:18:29.360 --> 00:18:32.480]   And they're-- yeah, and they're-- who are at the event.
[00:18:32.480 --> 00:18:35.840]   I'm trying to get as much data as possible where--
[00:18:35.840 --> 00:18:39.000]   again, everyone is there to do their job.
[00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:44.320]   But it's like where-- I have to sort of work my way around 18 people going, "Hi, this is
[00:18:44.320 --> 00:18:49.080]   Tom of Tom's Tom's Wicked--" and I've got an exclusive of the new iPhone 8.
[00:18:49.080 --> 00:18:53.040]   As you can see, it's like-- everyone has to do some live video if they don't have some
[00:18:53.040 --> 00:18:56.560]   time later on privately to get hardware.
[00:18:56.560 --> 00:18:57.880]   They've got to collect stuff.
[00:18:57.880 --> 00:19:03.720]   And this is the sort of stuff that is of use to Apple, of use to Samsung, of use to Motorola,
[00:19:03.720 --> 00:19:09.080]   whatever companies running this event to get as much play as possible on the same day when
[00:19:09.080 --> 00:19:12.160]   they can coordinate and take full advantage of this sort of stuff.
[00:19:12.160 --> 00:19:16.800]   So again, there are 100 different variables to who gets invited, who doesn't.
[00:19:16.800 --> 00:19:22.040]   But you can certainly see where, again, this is a-- this is an event with a goal in mind
[00:19:22.040 --> 00:19:24.920]   and some people figure into that goal, some people don't figure into that goal and there's
[00:19:24.920 --> 00:19:26.600]   absolutely nothing wrong with that.
[00:19:26.600 --> 00:19:32.000]   Here again from the pictures, Mac Magazine extracted from Google Maps is a picture of
[00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:37.960]   the stage and of course the extensive backstage area and you can see why that's so important.
[00:19:37.960 --> 00:19:43.880]   And then the $14,000 piece seats, so Renee, I hope you will be careful not to put gum
[00:19:43.880 --> 00:19:44.880]   underneath there.
[00:19:44.880 --> 00:19:46.440]   The Japanese toilets, those stadium seats.
[00:19:46.440 --> 00:19:53.560]   No bad seats in this auditorium that really, really is going to be a great place to see
[00:19:53.560 --> 00:19:55.200]   Apple's new stuff.
[00:19:55.200 --> 00:19:57.120]   So it's next week.
[00:19:57.120 --> 00:20:04.760]   I'm sure your plans include you are fully expecting besides new iPhones, at least a demo
[00:20:04.760 --> 00:20:06.720]   or some discussion of the Home Hub.
[00:20:06.720 --> 00:20:07.720]   Will there be new--
[00:20:07.720 --> 00:20:08.720]   Serial functionality.
[00:20:08.720 --> 00:20:13.400]   Well, I think we've never seen the serial functionality, only the Apple music functionality.
[00:20:13.400 --> 00:20:17.840]   So I expect to see a demo of all the voice commands and what it can actually do with
[00:20:17.840 --> 00:20:18.840]   all those.
[00:20:18.840 --> 00:20:23.080]   And hopefully it's got technology that the rumor at WWDC that people who had tried it
[00:20:23.080 --> 00:20:26.040]   said that you could be in a room, for example, you and I could be standing shoulder to shoulder
[00:20:26.040 --> 00:20:29.640]   in a room that was so loud, you couldn't really hear each other and in a normal voice, you
[00:20:29.640 --> 00:20:34.440]   could tell Siri to change the track and it would identify your voice and change the
[00:20:34.440 --> 00:20:35.440]   track for you.
[00:20:35.440 --> 00:20:36.440]   And I want to see that sort of technology.
[00:20:36.440 --> 00:20:37.440]   That's great.
[00:20:37.440 --> 00:20:38.680]   That would be really cool.
[00:20:38.680 --> 00:20:39.680]   Yeah.
[00:20:39.680 --> 00:20:44.600]   And speaking of Siri, it looks like according to the Apple executive listing on their web
[00:20:44.600 --> 00:20:48.520]   page, that Eddy Q is no longer in charge of Siri.
[00:20:48.520 --> 00:20:52.000]   Eddy has plenty other things to do.
[00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:57.000]   Craig Federighi, who's their software guy, will be running the Siri division.
[00:20:57.000 --> 00:20:58.640]   That was a while ago.
[00:20:58.640 --> 00:20:59.640]   It's funny, they make one word.
[00:20:59.640 --> 00:21:03.680]   It was a change on Apple.com results in 500 words on the Wall Street Journal, most of
[00:21:03.680 --> 00:21:05.160]   which are in complete filler.
[00:21:05.160 --> 00:21:06.560]   So that happened a while ago?
[00:21:06.560 --> 00:21:07.560]   Yeah.
[00:21:07.560 --> 00:21:09.000]   It was made for WWDC at least.
[00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:10.000]   Oh.
[00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:13.320]   Craigie, I thought that was like breaking news.
[00:21:13.320 --> 00:21:15.360]   See, I got to keep up with it with Renee's.
[00:21:15.360 --> 00:21:18.960]   Apple.com is usually the last place to go for breaking.
[00:21:18.960 --> 00:21:19.960]   Yeah, you're right.
[00:21:19.960 --> 00:21:20.960]   Except for the press section.
[00:21:20.960 --> 00:21:25.320]   But so Craig will presumably come out and show us Siri on the home.
[00:21:25.320 --> 00:21:27.000]   I keep saying Hub, HomePod.
[00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:30.080]   Yeah, he did all the demos for Siri at WWDC.
[00:21:30.080 --> 00:21:34.360]   And then he was the one on John's show explaining about how they were doing the Siri technology
[00:21:34.360 --> 00:21:35.360]   on the talk show live.
[00:21:35.360 --> 00:21:39.160]   And I'll be watching that one with real interest as somebody who's spent so much money on
[00:21:39.160 --> 00:21:40.160]   Sonos speakers.
[00:21:40.160 --> 00:21:42.760]   Sonos is having event October 4th.
[00:21:42.760 --> 00:21:47.080]   And we're pretty sure because of FCC filings, they'll be announcing a new speaker with Amazon
[00:21:47.080 --> 00:21:51.560]   Echo built in, Amazon Echo built in.
[00:21:51.560 --> 00:21:55.760]   But to me, that's a problematic because I have all the old speakers.
[00:21:55.760 --> 00:21:56.760]   I don't know.
[00:21:56.760 --> 00:21:57.760]   Yes.
[00:21:57.760 --> 00:22:02.600]   They better have a good trade in policy or maybe some little plug in that's that capability.
[00:22:02.600 --> 00:22:03.760]   It doesn't have to be anything.
[00:22:03.760 --> 00:22:05.600]   Remember, Sonos are all connected speakers.
[00:22:05.600 --> 00:22:10.880]   So if you have one device with a microphone that can access a scholar, then that can basically
[00:22:10.880 --> 00:22:14.520]   route or route or say whatever you want to whatever speaker.
[00:22:14.520 --> 00:22:18.960]   This is, I can't agree with the Sonos is in trouble sort of dialogue.
[00:22:18.960 --> 00:22:24.880]   It sometimes happens because at this point, there's so much, there's so much involvement
[00:22:24.880 --> 00:22:30.280]   with Google and with Amazon to put those voice assistants on as many platforms as possible
[00:22:30.280 --> 00:22:34.840]   that I really do think that any speaker company that wants to have a speaker with an advanced
[00:22:34.840 --> 00:22:37.680]   assistant can have one just by making the right deal.
[00:22:37.680 --> 00:22:41.760]   And I think that both those companies would be super eager to make that deal.
[00:22:41.760 --> 00:22:48.160]   The question is Apple's ability to create something that elevates a speaker like that
[00:22:48.160 --> 00:22:54.960]   from being 90% there, 95% there to being like, like, like Renee said, I don't know where
[00:22:54.960 --> 00:22:55.960]   he got that.
[00:22:55.960 --> 00:22:59.640]   But if that is true, it's the ability that I don't have to walk into the next room to
[00:22:59.640 --> 00:23:00.640]   give the command.
[00:23:00.640 --> 00:23:01.640]   I don't have to turn.
[00:23:01.640 --> 00:23:03.680]   I don't have to mute something to give a command.
[00:23:03.680 --> 00:23:07.400]   No matter what I do, no matter what tone of voice I use, no matter where I am in the
[00:23:07.400 --> 00:23:08.400]   room.
[00:23:08.400 --> 00:23:11.880]   I'm doing gum at the time I can give a command that will be responded to.
[00:23:11.880 --> 00:23:16.640]   That's the sort of thing that if you're developing the hardware and if you're aggressively about,
[00:23:16.640 --> 00:23:20.200]   hey, look at what great hardware we have, Apple can do and other companies can't.
[00:23:20.200 --> 00:23:22.480]   But Sonos can have an active speaker if they want.
[00:23:22.480 --> 00:23:27.120]   They can just, again, one lunch and they can have that done before the appetizers arrive.
[00:23:27.120 --> 00:23:30.720]   Well, they can have both Eskel and Cortana on the same speaker.
[00:23:30.720 --> 00:23:32.280]   Yes, they could do that.
[00:23:32.280 --> 00:23:34.640]   And in fact, we're not sure that they're only going to do echo.
[00:23:34.640 --> 00:23:39.640]   You know they'll do echo because that was what was mentioned in the new terms of service.
[00:23:39.640 --> 00:23:43.400]   But they said, for example, Amazon Web Services or Amazon voice services.
[00:23:43.400 --> 00:23:44.400]   So it could be other.
[00:23:44.400 --> 00:23:45.400]   It could be others.
[00:23:45.400 --> 00:23:46.800]   That would be nice, right?
[00:23:46.800 --> 00:23:51.240]   And Amazon has already announced that they're going to put Cortana in echo and echo is going
[00:23:51.240 --> 00:23:52.240]   to be in Cortana.
[00:23:52.240 --> 00:23:55.600]   Honestly, Leo, if the assistants would just talk to each other and I could relax and not
[00:23:55.600 --> 00:23:57.320]   have to worry about it, that'd be a plus for me.
[00:23:57.320 --> 00:23:58.320]   Me too.
[00:23:58.320 --> 00:24:02.680]   I just want one that knows all the others, friends with all the others and can ask the
[00:24:02.680 --> 00:24:03.680]   right person for the right person.
[00:24:03.680 --> 00:24:04.680]   What was joking?
[00:24:04.680 --> 00:24:05.840]   I said, "I can have Cortana write the article.
[00:24:05.840 --> 00:24:09.440]   I can have this kind of do the proof reading and then I can have Siri publish it and I can
[00:24:09.440 --> 00:24:10.440]   just nap."
[00:24:10.440 --> 00:24:11.440]   No.
[00:24:11.440 --> 00:24:13.680]   But I might disagree a little bit with you, Andy.
[00:24:13.680 --> 00:24:17.880]   I agree that Sonos could leap on this, but they haven't shown any, they said they were
[00:24:17.880 --> 00:24:19.120]   going to do it at the beginning of the year.
[00:24:19.120 --> 00:24:22.600]   They haven't shown any initiative up to now.
[00:24:22.600 --> 00:24:26.640]   And I'm, I don't, I think that they're really in a world now.
[00:24:26.640 --> 00:24:27.840]   We tested it and it works quite well.
[00:24:27.840 --> 00:24:31.720]   You can get all the Amazon Echo speakers to play in party mode without any latency.
[00:24:31.720 --> 00:24:33.320]   Any echo works great.
[00:24:33.320 --> 00:24:41.000]   So anybody who's invested in either dots or taps or echoes or, or shows or the new look
[00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:43.840]   will have that capability.
[00:24:43.840 --> 00:24:49.600]   I just, I feel like, I feel like Sonos is late to the party, but I hope, I hope you're right
[00:24:49.600 --> 00:24:53.240]   because I have a massive, the best minute Sonos.
[00:24:53.240 --> 00:24:57.880]   The most powerful limiting factor in any technology is the desire to actually do something.
[00:24:57.880 --> 00:25:01.960]   I mean, Apple can do whatever, Apple can do anything, Google can do anything.
[00:25:01.960 --> 00:25:03.240]   All these companies can do whatever.
[00:25:03.240 --> 00:25:06.640]   They just have to decide that they want this thing to get done.
[00:25:06.640 --> 00:25:11.640]   And I don't think, I don't think that anyone in Sonos is, is denying that this sort of
[00:25:11.640 --> 00:25:13.560]   speaker is a threat.
[00:25:13.560 --> 00:25:17.640]   And I don't think they, I think they also realize that, again, these tiny, tiny little
[00:25:17.640 --> 00:25:23.000]   speakers that they don't, they aren't great speakers, but they're good enough speakers.
[00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:26.240]   And remember what happened with, with camera phones.
[00:25:26.240 --> 00:25:31.120]   They are still not great cameras, but they're good enough for what people want to use a
[00:25:31.120 --> 00:25:33.040]   camera for in general.
[00:25:33.040 --> 00:25:39.640]   And so the ability to say, but we have a 28 megapixel self stabilizing, 341 degree camera.
[00:25:39.640 --> 00:25:42.880]   So yeah, but we don't want a $400 one of those.
[00:25:42.880 --> 00:25:46.480]   We might rather have a free one of those that's built into the thing we already have.
[00:25:46.480 --> 00:25:50.800]   So that's, I think the bigger threat is really these really good $100 speakers.
[00:25:50.800 --> 00:25:56.360]   And now that now that Amazon is, you can routinely get an echo for a hundred bucks now.
[00:25:56.360 --> 00:26:00.240]   They, everybody is shifting in response to a product that hasn't shipped yet.
[00:26:00.240 --> 00:26:05.400]   And I think that's the, that's the, that's Apple's core competency to scare everybody,
[00:26:05.400 --> 00:26:06.560]   but just one good demo.
[00:26:06.560 --> 00:26:07.560]   Yeah.
[00:26:07.560 --> 00:26:08.560]   Yeah.
[00:26:08.560 --> 00:26:12.480]   But, but if it, if it lives up to its promise, I think I, I could see home pods throughout
[00:26:12.480 --> 00:26:13.480]   my house.
[00:26:13.480 --> 00:26:14.480]   Yeah.
[00:26:14.480 --> 00:26:16.320]   I mean, that's, that's, that's why we're going to get, I'm sure we're going to get a great
[00:26:16.320 --> 00:26:21.160]   demo next Tuesday because if they, I think everybody's sort of programmed to know that
[00:26:21.160 --> 00:26:24.520]   whatever Apple makes, they're not going to be able to make enough of them.
[00:26:24.520 --> 00:26:26.960]   And so that's the new normal, isn't it?
[00:26:26.960 --> 00:26:27.960]   That's so terrible.
[00:26:27.960 --> 00:26:28.960]   Exactly.
[00:26:28.960 --> 00:26:33.760]   I mean, how many people, everybody I know who has air pods, myself included, will always,
[00:26:33.760 --> 00:26:35.480]   when, whenever we're asked, you say, Oh, they're great.
[00:26:35.480 --> 00:26:39.840]   They really work wonderfully, but then people can't translate that into actually buying
[00:26:39.840 --> 00:26:40.840]   a pair.
[00:26:40.840 --> 00:26:45.200]   So there's, I think that the, they, I think everyone at Apple knows that they're going
[00:26:45.200 --> 00:26:53.800]   to sell out of their entire first run of, of the, of the, of HomePod about 28 minutes
[00:26:53.800 --> 00:26:55.360]   after they open pre-orders.
[00:26:55.360 --> 00:26:56.360]   Yep.
[00:26:56.360 --> 00:27:00.600]   And so they're, their goal for, for Tuesday is to make sure that they make such, they,
[00:27:00.600 --> 00:27:05.240]   they, they push so many emotional buttons about HomePods, the HomePod that they will
[00:27:05.240 --> 00:27:09.080]   make sure that if they say, and it's available for order today.
[00:27:09.080 --> 00:27:13.400]   And so that's, that's, that's the other advantage that you and I and Alex will have
[00:27:13.400 --> 00:27:17.320]   that over ever else in the room that I will have like another screen ready on the Apple
[00:27:17.320 --> 00:27:19.320]   page as soon as creators.
[00:27:19.320 --> 00:27:22.560]   While you, while you saps are taking notes and taking pictures, I'll be placing an order
[00:27:22.560 --> 00:27:25.640]   for $300 for $300 speaker that I don't need.
[00:27:25.640 --> 00:27:28.280]   I do think though, that's one of the reasons Apple no longer does that.
[00:27:28.280 --> 00:27:33.480]   I remember being in an Apple event where they said that and it was a race to get out of,
[00:27:33.480 --> 00:27:38.400]   uh, it was at the time, Moscone West and run up to the Apple store, uh, Market Street
[00:27:38.400 --> 00:27:39.400]   and get that.
[00:27:39.400 --> 00:27:41.920]   Literally, I didn't drink WDC.
[00:27:41.920 --> 00:27:45.100]   Remember like they put the laptops on sale and suddenly there was a developer line around
[00:27:45.100 --> 00:27:46.100]   the block.
[00:27:46.100 --> 00:27:47.100]   Yeah.
[00:27:47.100 --> 00:27:50.480]   Then you, then you, then you, then you, then you, Alex, Lindsey, and I huffed up the streets
[00:27:50.480 --> 00:27:52.440]   again to get whatever it was.
[00:27:52.440 --> 00:27:59.320]   Although my, my, one piece of, uh, of envy is I'm wondering if your, if Renee and everyone
[00:27:59.320 --> 00:28:04.480]   else there is not going to go home with some little chotch key, if not a piece of working
[00:28:04.480 --> 00:28:09.400]   hardware in celebration of the fact that we are now opening these Steve Jobs theater,
[00:28:09.400 --> 00:28:13.920]   whether it's maybe even like a really nice print, uh, really good paper.
[00:28:13.920 --> 00:28:14.920]   I think so.
[00:28:14.920 --> 00:28:20.080]   Uh, I, I, one thing I would really like to be there for is I am sure there will be at
[00:28:20.080 --> 00:28:24.520]   the beginning some acknowledgement of Steve's memory and the fact this is the Steve Jobs
[00:28:24.520 --> 00:28:27.520]   theater and they'll say that yo, yo, mother, you all cry.
[00:28:27.520 --> 00:28:28.520]   I can't explain it from everybody.
[00:28:28.520 --> 00:28:30.000]   You'll be, you know what they might.
[00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:33.600]   I mean, I could see them, you know, doing something like that and they should do something
[00:28:33.600 --> 00:28:37.960]   like that because this is the, this is the new, the campus was really the last thing Steve
[00:28:37.960 --> 00:28:39.120]   Jobs did.
[00:28:39.120 --> 00:28:46.160]   Uh, and, uh, and it's now open and this theater is aptly named for Steve Jobs.
[00:28:46.160 --> 00:28:48.840]   So I'd be very, that, I, I look forward to that.
[00:28:48.840 --> 00:28:51.160]   There'll be a touching moment for, for his stage.
[00:28:51.160 --> 00:28:52.160]   Yeah.
[00:28:52.160 --> 00:28:53.160]   Yeah.
[00:28:53.160 --> 00:28:56.200]   Look out, look out for whatever, if there's going to be some sort of a plaque there or
[00:28:56.200 --> 00:29:00.600]   some sort of a commemorative there, the, the one thing that's been missing from all this
[00:29:00.600 --> 00:29:03.640]   coverage that we've been seeing, all the photos have been snuck out is that you don't
[00:29:03.640 --> 00:29:07.040]   see any art anywhere around here.
[00:29:07.040 --> 00:29:12.760]   And you think about how in the 40s and 50s and 60s, how corporations were commissioning
[00:29:12.760 --> 00:29:20.240]   Picasso and they're commissioning, uh, they're commissioning, uh, I think it was another
[00:29:20.240 --> 00:29:21.600]   company did a Mondrian.
[00:29:21.600 --> 00:29:25.880]   There's another company that's doing Alexander Calder sculptures that didn't exist until
[00:29:25.880 --> 00:29:30.960]   this insurance company that was flush with post war money basically had this huge sculpture
[00:29:30.960 --> 00:29:33.600]   made or this huge mural to put in.
[00:29:33.600 --> 00:29:41.480]   And I, I would be excited to see what apples taste in art would be and what kind of sculpture
[00:29:41.480 --> 00:29:45.400]   they would commission and what kind of paintings and murals they would commission, what kind
[00:29:45.400 --> 00:29:47.000]   of tile work they would commission.
[00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:52.160]   I have to say that I'm, I'm, there's a, the opposite of brutalist architecture.
[00:29:52.160 --> 00:29:58.360]   I think is what we tend to see in like the Apple store redesigns and what I've seen from
[00:29:58.360 --> 00:30:02.000]   this campus design where it's like, it's just so soft.
[00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:08.280]   And so there's so lack of detail that there's, there needs to be something amazing that when
[00:30:08.280 --> 00:30:11.640]   you turn the corner that you're glad that you continue to walk another half a block.
[00:30:11.640 --> 00:30:12.840]   You're hard to see it.
[00:30:12.840 --> 00:30:16.760]   And he, the building itself is the art, Andy.
[00:30:16.760 --> 00:30:19.480]   It's the, you don't, you don't know until the employees move in.
[00:30:19.480 --> 00:30:23.120]   I mean, we can design it, but until people start to use it, we don't know what it is.
[00:30:23.120 --> 00:30:24.480]   I know what you're saying though.
[00:30:24.480 --> 00:30:28.400]   And I'm thinking, I'm reminded of the, what we, what we colloquially in San Francisco called
[00:30:28.400 --> 00:30:33.040]   the banker's heart, which is 200 tons of black Swedish granite out in front of the B of
[00:30:33.040 --> 00:30:34.040]   A building.
[00:30:34.040 --> 00:30:37.400]   Uh, and this is a very famous, there's Calder.
[00:30:37.400 --> 00:30:40.760]   There's a, there's a, a, a mountain in San Francisco.
[00:30:40.760 --> 00:30:45.920]   There's these, this kind of public art was kind of a status symbol for corporations and
[00:30:45.920 --> 00:30:49.080]   days gone by, but I also think Apple has a different aesthetic a little bit.
[00:30:49.080 --> 00:30:52.520]   I don't remember seeing a lot of art on the one and the other.
[00:30:52.520 --> 00:30:57.200]   Steve Jobs pictures the, in the Apple media center now, I think it's IL5.
[00:30:57.200 --> 00:31:01.000]   You go in and there's the iconic pictures of Steve Jobs, like with the Macintosh and
[00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:02.080]   then there's the quotes.
[00:31:02.080 --> 00:31:04.480]   Like if you do something great, don't dwell on it, but move on to the net.
[00:31:04.480 --> 00:31:06.280]   All of that is sort of what fills those buildings.
[00:31:06.280 --> 00:31:09.640]   I mean, when does Google have a bunch of dessert statues?
[00:31:09.640 --> 00:31:13.080]   Well, there are little flatchers here.
[00:31:13.080 --> 00:31:17.000]   There's a, I've seen, I've seen on campus, but, but it's not, but it's different.
[00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:22.360]   The Google's campus, Google's campus is still in the mode where every time that they need
[00:31:22.360 --> 00:31:24.880]   more space, they buy another street.
[00:31:24.880 --> 00:31:25.880]   And so it's not real.
[00:31:25.880 --> 00:31:29.040]   They didn't, it's, it's when you have the ability to say we're built, we are developing
[00:31:29.040 --> 00:31:32.560]   an entire parkland that's going to be our corporate offices, but we're also planting
[00:31:32.560 --> 00:31:33.560]   trees.
[00:31:33.560 --> 00:31:35.200]   We're also putting this here and we're also putting that there.
[00:31:35.200 --> 00:31:41.480]   I mean, I can imagine that it must be kind of boring to spend what will be probably literally
[00:31:41.480 --> 00:31:45.840]   half your life while you're employed at Apple in this space where there is no art, where
[00:31:45.840 --> 00:31:51.640]   there is at no point do you turn the, do you turn the corner and there is this amazing,
[00:31:51.640 --> 00:31:56.520]   the amazing tile work from an artist you've never heard of in a culture that is so savagely
[00:31:56.520 --> 00:31:58.880]   underrepresented.
[00:31:58.880 --> 00:32:03.120]   And while you're waiting for your appointment or just, you know, bored because you have
[00:32:03.120 --> 00:32:06.200]   to stick around waiting for something to finish when you have nothing to do, you see a new
[00:32:06.200 --> 00:32:11.280]   thing in there or something that is, as you're taking your daily walk from the, from the
[00:32:11.280 --> 00:32:16.080]   cafeteria to your office where you pass by again, that piece of sculpture that maybe
[00:32:16.080 --> 00:32:19.720]   you will not even really notice it for the first three or four months, but then you start
[00:32:19.720 --> 00:32:21.320]   to see more and more detail.
[00:32:21.320 --> 00:32:26.160]   I'm, it's, it's a very, it's a very, I think it's very 20th century.
[00:32:26.160 --> 00:32:28.560]   I think, I think you're living in the past.
[00:32:28.560 --> 00:32:33.080]   I think that there's a point it would agree with you, though, take it, which taking away
[00:32:33.080 --> 00:32:37.080]   details in simplifying is a creative choice.
[00:32:37.080 --> 00:32:39.680]   And there's a point at which it's lazy.
[00:32:39.680 --> 00:32:40.680]   I don't know.
[00:32:40.680 --> 00:32:44.520]   It's, I was really, I'm not saying that Apple should do this sort of thing or any other
[00:32:44.520 --> 00:32:45.800]   company should do this thing.
[00:32:45.800 --> 00:32:49.120]   I'm just saying that I was very, very keen to see if they would do this thing because
[00:32:49.120 --> 00:32:54.560]   apples, Apple, again, I'm sure that Apple would have a really, really interesting eye
[00:32:54.560 --> 00:32:56.080]   towards art.
[00:32:56.080 --> 00:33:00.960]   And when I go into a modern Apple store and I see that their entire design aesthetic is
[00:33:00.960 --> 00:33:05.200]   beige wood and lighting and aluminum panels.
[00:33:05.200 --> 00:33:07.080]   It's like, okay, I mean, I'm here.
[00:33:07.080 --> 00:33:08.080]   I'm not here.
[00:33:08.080 --> 00:33:10.880]   You're clearly not, you know, I'm not here to look at anything but the product.
[00:33:10.880 --> 00:33:12.600]   I get that.
[00:33:12.600 --> 00:33:15.600]   And I just wish it were a little bit more interesting.
[00:33:15.600 --> 00:33:16.840]   It's, it's no legal.
[00:33:16.840 --> 00:33:17.840]   There's no Lego store.
[00:33:17.840 --> 00:33:19.480]   I'm a fan of public art.
[00:33:19.480 --> 00:33:20.600]   I completely agree with you.
[00:33:20.600 --> 00:33:23.920]   And I would like to see more, but I do feel like that's, that's a different.
[00:33:23.920 --> 00:33:24.920]   Feel.
[00:33:24.920 --> 00:33:25.920]   Yeah.
[00:33:25.920 --> 00:33:27.680]   Apple, does Apple stuff the icon garden?
[00:33:27.680 --> 00:33:31.960]   I remember they had the, the original Mac icons, like little statues.
[00:33:31.960 --> 00:33:35.640]   I wonder if they still have the pixel art for one tooth, like the buildings.
[00:33:35.640 --> 00:33:36.840]   And they're pixelated one.
[00:33:36.840 --> 00:33:37.840]   Right.
[00:33:37.840 --> 00:33:38.840]   pixelated two.
[00:33:38.840 --> 00:33:39.840]   Right.
[00:33:39.840 --> 00:33:40.840]   Yeah, that's not really it is it.
[00:33:40.840 --> 00:33:41.840]   Let's see.
[00:33:41.840 --> 00:33:49.560]   Anything else to be said about this event will see almost certainly a new Apple TV 4K HDR.
[00:33:49.560 --> 00:33:50.640]   I was wondering it.
[00:33:50.640 --> 00:33:54.280]   What do the rumors say about the HDR standards that will be used?
[00:33:54.280 --> 00:34:00.680]   There's a last count, I think four, but the big one is HDR 10 and is Dolby.
[00:34:00.680 --> 00:34:08.080]   So if we look at iOS 11 and Mac OS high Sierra as sort of the foreshadowing of this, then
[00:34:08.080 --> 00:34:13.440]   Apple is supporting HEVC high efficiency video codec, which is the really weird name for
[00:34:13.440 --> 00:34:16.280]   H.265 at 10 bit level.
[00:34:16.280 --> 00:34:20.760]   So eight bit is the traditional 4K and then the 10 bit is the HDR version of 4K.
[00:34:20.760 --> 00:34:23.880]   So it's, so, you know, it's all software.
[00:34:23.880 --> 00:34:25.760]   So presumably whatever standards.
[00:34:25.760 --> 00:34:26.840]   Well, and their chipset.
[00:34:26.840 --> 00:34:31.040]   So they built acceleration into the latest series of Apple, like the A, I believe it's
[00:34:31.040 --> 00:34:35.320]   the, I forget if it's the A9, at least definitely the A10 and Kaby Lake and tells Kaby Lake
[00:34:35.320 --> 00:34:37.160]   series provides hardware.
[00:34:37.160 --> 00:34:40.480]   That's the big difference between Skylake and Kaby Lake on the 4K front is that Skylake
[00:34:40.480 --> 00:34:46.320]   does 4K, Kaby Lake does 4K HDR and Apple's latest generation ships do 4K HDR as well.
[00:34:46.320 --> 00:34:47.320]   Interesting.
[00:34:47.320 --> 00:34:52.680]   Let's see.
[00:34:52.680 --> 00:34:58.480]   I think that's all of the issues going on for next to, we want to be ready for next Tuesday.
[00:34:58.480 --> 00:34:59.480]   Is there a one more thing?
[00:34:59.480 --> 00:35:00.480]   That sounds like a lot, but it's going to be a lot.
[00:35:00.480 --> 00:35:01.480]   Oh, it's all ton.
[00:35:01.480 --> 00:35:02.480]   It sounds like a lot.
[00:35:02.480 --> 00:35:03.800]   It's a ton.
[00:35:03.800 --> 00:35:05.880]   And one more thing lately has been Apple music.
[00:35:05.880 --> 00:35:10.000]   So you never know it could be Apple video or something, but, or it could be like research
[00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:11.400]   kit, but they always have that in their back.
[00:35:11.400 --> 00:35:14.280]   Maybe that's why you have such a big backstage area because then you lift the black curtain
[00:35:14.280 --> 00:35:18.480]   up and there are the Arctic monkeys ready to perform for you.
[00:35:18.480 --> 00:35:21.720]   No, it's a live version of that planet.
[00:35:21.720 --> 00:35:24.200]   Oh, let's get out quick.
[00:35:24.200 --> 00:35:25.680]   Where's the demo?
[00:35:25.680 --> 00:35:32.640]   Oh, look, it's, it's, it's, I, I, I, I am blank the names.
[00:35:32.640 --> 00:35:35.200]   Yeah, Gwyneth Paltrow.
[00:35:35.200 --> 00:35:37.440]   Oh, look.
[00:35:37.440 --> 00:35:39.280]   Okay.
[00:35:39.280 --> 00:35:43.160]   The stock, by the way, jumped as soon as that.
[00:35:43.160 --> 00:35:46.440]   Did you, is it, why don't they send a paper invitation?
[00:35:46.440 --> 00:35:47.440]   You did you get a paper?
[00:35:47.440 --> 00:35:49.080]   Yes, it would be a no.
[00:35:49.080 --> 00:35:52.040]   No, they, I mean, they don't, for WSC, they don't even send an email anymore.
[00:35:52.040 --> 00:35:55.400]   It's just a phone call and for, and for these events, it's a, it's an email.
[00:35:55.400 --> 00:35:57.600]   It's really cool because you tap on it.
[00:35:57.600 --> 00:36:00.920]   You say you're going, then you get a, an Apple wallet thing that should, you know, that
[00:36:00.920 --> 00:36:03.360]   shows up when you're there with, and in.
[00:36:03.360 --> 00:36:04.360]   Oh, that's neat.
[00:36:04.360 --> 00:36:05.360]   Yeah.
[00:36:05.360 --> 00:36:06.360]   That's how they do the admission.
[00:36:06.360 --> 00:36:07.360]   Yeah, that's cool.
[00:36:07.360 --> 00:36:11.760]   Also, were they given, given the short and timeframe, are they going to take the chance
[00:36:11.760 --> 00:36:14.000]   that everybody's going to get them on the same day at the same time?
[00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:18.320]   Or are they going to have to deal with somebody got there before someone else and then someone
[00:36:18.320 --> 00:36:21.280]   else is saying, Hey, I was just wondering if mine's in the mail.
[00:36:21.280 --> 00:36:22.600]   Oh, no, you're got to email them.
[00:36:22.600 --> 00:36:23.600]   You're right.
[00:36:23.600 --> 00:36:24.600]   Yeah.
[00:36:24.600 --> 00:36:26.040]   They did release it.
[00:36:26.040 --> 00:36:27.040]   Thank goodness they put it out.
[00:36:27.040 --> 00:36:30.480]   I'm sure your travel agents happy Renee, they put it out a little bit earlier than they
[00:36:30.480 --> 00:36:35.200]   usually do a week and a half early instead of a week early.
[00:36:35.200 --> 00:36:36.200]   Yeah.
[00:36:36.200 --> 00:36:39.560]   And I always think that South Bay is going to make things easier and South Bay never makes
[00:36:39.560 --> 00:36:40.560]   things easier.
[00:36:40.560 --> 00:36:42.800]   No, how about how?
[00:36:42.800 --> 00:36:44.600]   I don't know why we're stuck.
[00:36:44.600 --> 00:36:45.600]   Are we stuck?
[00:36:45.600 --> 00:36:47.560]   The track has just stuck on Andy.
[00:36:47.560 --> 00:36:49.840]   Andy, I mean, what did you just, one of them.
[00:36:49.840 --> 00:36:52.720]   Yeah, everything we say just lip sync it, will you?
[00:36:52.720 --> 00:36:55.200]   If you had a choice of being stuck on somebody would be Andy too.
[00:36:55.200 --> 00:36:56.200]   Certainly.
[00:36:56.200 --> 00:36:59.640]   He knows how to use that extra screen time.
[00:36:59.640 --> 00:37:06.200]   One question we got yesterday is when will iOS 11 come out?
[00:37:06.200 --> 00:37:07.920]   Will it come out that day?
[00:37:07.920 --> 00:37:12.640]   The gold master, if Apple follows the previous patterns, the gold master for all four OS's
[00:37:12.640 --> 00:37:16.680]   will be released that day and then developers will have eight days to work on it.
[00:37:16.680 --> 00:37:21.240]   And then the Tuesday or Wednesday before those, the hardware launches, that'll all be pushed
[00:37:21.240 --> 00:37:22.240]   out.
[00:37:22.240 --> 00:37:29.320]   So you get it before the new hardware and then I think iPhone 3G was the last one that did
[00:37:29.320 --> 00:37:31.040]   the same day and all the servers crashed.
[00:37:31.040 --> 00:37:33.520]   So now they do it like two or three days early.
[00:37:33.520 --> 00:37:35.720]   So it would be the 20th or 21st.
[00:37:35.720 --> 00:37:38.360]   I'm not laughing at your name, laughing at Andy.
[00:37:38.360 --> 00:37:43.200]   No, I mean, if you're listening on audio, it just sounds like I'm insane, but Andy's
[00:37:43.200 --> 00:37:44.480]   really got the lip sync.
[00:37:44.480 --> 00:37:47.320]   Andy has a Canadian beaver, no, he's not a beaver, he's a groundhog, right?
[00:37:47.320 --> 00:37:49.640]   We figured out the tail issue last time.
[00:37:49.640 --> 00:37:50.640]   Yeah.
[00:37:50.640 --> 00:37:51.640]   He doesn't have a paddle.
[00:37:51.640 --> 00:37:52.640]   No.
[00:37:52.640 --> 00:37:54.880]   Well, maybe he can, he can switch it.
[00:37:54.880 --> 00:37:57.920]   Do you want to reboot the Tricaster or something or?
[00:37:57.920 --> 00:38:00.920]   Okay, Andy, you could put the rodent down.
[00:38:00.920 --> 00:38:01.920]   Thank you.
[00:38:01.920 --> 00:38:04.520]   Thank you, thank you, Ernie.
[00:38:04.520 --> 00:38:05.520]   You're welcome.
[00:38:05.520 --> 00:38:09.040]   I appreciate the camera time.
[00:38:09.040 --> 00:38:12.160]   Hello to all my new fans.
[00:38:12.160 --> 00:38:14.880]   Check out my Instagram.
[00:38:14.880 --> 00:38:18.080]   Support my work on Patreon.
[00:38:18.080 --> 00:38:24.880]   I've got series of videos about things that are almost relevant, but not quite.
[00:38:24.880 --> 00:38:28.280]   So basically I'm a YouTube superstar.
[00:38:28.280 --> 00:38:37.360]   Boy, boy, so long.
[00:38:37.360 --> 00:38:38.440]   Put the rodent down.
[00:38:38.440 --> 00:38:40.080]   That's the title of the show now.
[00:38:40.080 --> 00:38:41.080]   Let's see.
[00:38:41.080 --> 00:38:42.080]   Oh, okay.
[00:38:42.080 --> 00:38:44.600]   iOS 11, I wanted to ask about that.
[00:38:44.600 --> 00:38:49.880]   By the way, I don't know if this is related, but congratulations to Tim Cook, whose compensation
[00:38:49.880 --> 00:38:58.080]   now is, looks roughly according to the register, like $89 million.
[00:38:58.080 --> 00:39:02.520]   It is a rounding error and not even a very high decimal one on Apple's quarterly never
[00:39:02.520 --> 00:39:03.520]   mind.
[00:39:03.520 --> 00:39:05.400]   Pay the guy whatever he wants.
[00:39:05.400 --> 00:39:10.600]   He sold, let's see, $89 million in shares after exceeding his performance target, the
[00:39:10.600 --> 00:39:16.080]   windfall due to the sale of 560,000 shares, half of which were linked to the company's
[00:39:16.080 --> 00:39:17.480]   performance.
[00:39:17.480 --> 00:39:23.160]   He has 1 million shares of Apple if he stays there till 2021.
[00:39:23.160 --> 00:39:26.120]   And I think he's already pledged to accept for his nephew or nieces.
[00:39:26.120 --> 00:39:27.560]   I forget which one it is.
[00:39:27.560 --> 00:39:29.120]   Education, he's going to donate all that.
[00:39:29.120 --> 00:39:30.520]   That's that awesome.
[00:39:30.520 --> 00:39:31.520]   Yeah.
[00:39:31.520 --> 00:39:32.520]   Yeah.
[00:39:32.520 --> 00:39:35.360]   Remember that he got a pay cut earlier this year.
[00:39:35.360 --> 00:39:40.000]   His modest $8.7 million take home was fortified.
[00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:44.520]   I'm reading from the register, which always is very good with words.
[00:39:44.520 --> 00:39:50.480]   By a package of vesting stock options that netted him a cool $135 million payout earlier.
[00:39:50.480 --> 00:39:52.920]   That's probably less than their paper budget at Apple.
[00:39:52.920 --> 00:39:53.920]   Yeah.
[00:39:53.920 --> 00:39:58.320]   And unlike as they point out, under like a lot of other chief executives down the road,
[00:39:58.320 --> 00:40:00.920]   he's not a billionaire.
[00:40:00.920 --> 00:40:02.440]   He's doing all right.
[00:40:02.440 --> 00:40:03.440]   He's not poor.
[00:40:03.440 --> 00:40:05.960]   Doesn't have founder money.
[00:40:05.960 --> 00:40:07.520]   Tim, we're going to take a break.
[00:40:07.520 --> 00:40:13.000]   But when we come back, I do want to, Tim Cook said an interesting thing, which I liked a
[00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:20.040]   lot in conversation with a reporter about the role of the CEO.
[00:40:20.040 --> 00:40:25.360]   He also did a hurricane relief email and a DACA email today.
[00:40:25.360 --> 00:40:26.360]   Yeah.
[00:40:26.360 --> 00:40:27.360]   Yeah.
[00:40:27.360 --> 00:40:31.520]   Of course, he and rest of Silicon Valley have been very critical enough to change to DACA.
[00:40:31.520 --> 00:40:33.600]   But we'll talk about all of that in a second.
[00:40:33.600 --> 00:40:36.560]   Andy Inaco and his puppet are here from the Chicago Sun Times.
[00:40:36.560 --> 00:40:42.960]   A puppet was, of course, independent for named Richie from iMourg.com.
[00:40:42.960 --> 00:40:46.120]   And our show today brought to you by LegalZoom.
[00:40:46.120 --> 00:40:51.080]   I have a soft spot right here in my heart for LegalZoom because they helped us start
[00:40:51.080 --> 00:40:57.400]   Twitter way back when getting that LLC set up, the trademarks set up.
[00:40:57.400 --> 00:41:03.680]   When you run your own business, there are certain things you need to do.
[00:41:03.680 --> 00:41:09.560]   But they, you know, legally, legal wise, but they can cost you a lot of money.
[00:41:09.560 --> 00:41:11.480]   When you're just starting up, you don't have a lot of money.
[00:41:11.480 --> 00:41:14.240]   That's why I love LegalZoom.
[00:41:14.240 --> 00:41:17.280]   It saves money, but it also saves you time.
[00:41:17.280 --> 00:41:21.760]   You may already know over two million people have used LegalZoom to start their businesses,
[00:41:21.760 --> 00:41:23.760]   but their services don't end there.
[00:41:23.760 --> 00:41:29.040]   So, you know, once you incorporate, then there's taxes, contracts, hiring employees.
[00:41:29.040 --> 00:41:31.160]   There's a lot of fine print.
[00:41:31.160 --> 00:41:33.200]   LegalZoom can help with that too.
[00:41:33.200 --> 00:41:37.920]   They're not a law firm, but they have built a network of independent attorneys licensed
[00:41:37.920 --> 00:41:42.400]   in all 50 states who can give you what, you know, the advice you need to get you through
[00:41:42.400 --> 00:41:45.080]   the daily grind of running your business.
[00:41:45.080 --> 00:41:47.720]   And I love it because you don't have to worry about billable hours.
[00:41:47.720 --> 00:41:52.280]   It's always, you know, every time I talk to an attorney on the phone, I'm thinking, click
[00:41:52.280 --> 00:41:57.360]   another $50, click another $50, click, you don't have to worry about that.
[00:41:57.360 --> 00:41:59.720]   LegalZoom's not a law firm up front up.
[00:41:59.720 --> 00:42:03.600]   They pre-negotiate an upfront price with every one of these attorneys.
[00:42:03.600 --> 00:42:05.360]   So, you know, exactly what it's going to cost you.
[00:42:05.360 --> 00:42:06.360]   And it's very affordable.
[00:42:06.360 --> 00:42:11.200]   Best your time and money in growing your business and let LegalZoom help out with the legal stuff
[00:42:11.200 --> 00:42:13.840]   we all have to deal with for special savings.
[00:42:13.840 --> 00:42:18.800]   Don't forget the promo code MBW in the referral box.
[00:42:18.800 --> 00:42:22.760]   Check out that's MBW at legalzoom.com.
[00:42:22.760 --> 00:42:29.960]   That's also how they know you heard it here and that helps support the show.
[00:42:29.960 --> 00:42:33.840]   So Mr. Cook goes to Washington.
[00:42:33.840 --> 00:42:38.840]   He is, you know, I really admire Tim Cook.
[00:42:38.840 --> 00:42:42.680]   Not merely is a good operating officer and that's really his real skill, but he's also
[00:42:42.680 --> 00:42:46.000]   a man of conscience and does not hold back.
[00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:49.120]   So tell us about those letters because I haven't seen the new letters.
[00:42:49.120 --> 00:42:54.600]   So, the one over the weekend was for Hurricane Harvey's support and he detailed how Apple
[00:42:54.600 --> 00:43:00.640]   had donated $2 million directly and they did a match with employees where they did a two-to-one
[00:43:00.640 --> 00:43:04.080]   match with employee donations and also let people donate through iTunes.
[00:43:04.080 --> 00:43:07.280]   And I think the total just after a couple of days was $3 million already.
[00:43:07.280 --> 00:43:08.280]   Nice.
[00:43:08.280 --> 00:43:11.760]   And the Coast Guard's using iPads.
[00:43:11.760 --> 00:43:12.760]   So that was really cool.
[00:43:12.760 --> 00:43:17.520]   That was a young lady with sickle cell anemia who was just stuck and couldn't get out and
[00:43:17.520 --> 00:43:21.000]   she couldn't get through to 911 and she couldn't really figure out what to do.
[00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:22.320]   And she, the quote was amazing.
[00:43:22.320 --> 00:43:25.880]   She said, "I know Siri was really smart, so I asked Siri to call the Coast Guard and
[00:43:25.880 --> 00:43:26.880]   it did."
[00:43:26.880 --> 00:43:31.320]   Now, I tried to do that, by the way.
[00:43:31.320 --> 00:43:32.320]   Have you tried it?
[00:43:32.320 --> 00:43:33.320]   Well, you can't because you're in the US.
[00:43:33.320 --> 00:43:35.040]   I don't have a Coast Guard.
[00:43:35.040 --> 00:43:38.240]   So what Siri did on my iPhone when I said, "Call the Coast Guard.
[00:43:38.240 --> 00:43:40.960]   Is it dialed emergency services?"
[00:43:40.960 --> 00:43:43.400]   I can't do it because I can't do it because I was a person.
[00:43:43.400 --> 00:43:46.360]   Yeah, so it is a dynamic service so it could always be changing things.
[00:43:46.360 --> 00:43:49.120]   But the Coast Guard came and the first group wouldn't take her because they were tasked
[00:43:49.120 --> 00:43:52.720]   only with the elderly, but then a second group came I think the next day and they evacked
[00:43:52.720 --> 00:43:53.720]   her.
[00:43:53.720 --> 00:43:54.720]   Yes.
[00:43:54.720 --> 00:43:58.960]   And she was in a lot of pain so that was, to put it mildly, so that was great.
[00:43:58.960 --> 00:44:02.680]   And it's just, it's one of those things where you don't think about the voice activation
[00:44:02.680 --> 00:44:06.240]   until you're in an accident and your phone gets thrown across into the back of the car
[00:44:06.240 --> 00:44:10.520]   and you can't reach it and then you can use it to call or the SOS button as also help
[00:44:10.520 --> 00:44:12.520]   people because your watch doesn't leave your wrist.
[00:44:12.520 --> 00:44:14.240]   It's right there and you can still use it.
[00:44:14.240 --> 00:44:15.320]   These voice services are great.
[00:44:15.320 --> 00:44:19.840]   I had a call the other day on the radio show from a guy who fell and broke his hip and
[00:44:19.840 --> 00:44:24.680]   he couldn't reach his phone, so he, but he knew that the, he realized, oh, I can use
[00:44:24.680 --> 00:44:27.200]   the Echo to call my brother's Echo.
[00:44:27.200 --> 00:44:30.360]   Echo is only Echo to Echo calling, but he called his brother's Echo and said, get over
[00:44:30.360 --> 00:44:31.360]   here.
[00:44:31.360 --> 00:44:32.360]   I just fell.
[00:44:32.360 --> 00:44:33.360]   I think I broke my hip.
[00:44:33.360 --> 00:44:34.360]   So it saved him.
[00:44:34.360 --> 00:44:35.360]   Yeah.
[00:44:35.360 --> 00:44:38.080]   You should train your family, like go through it with your kids, with your parents, with
[00:44:38.080 --> 00:44:39.080]   your loved ones.
[00:44:39.080 --> 00:44:41.880]   I just think sure everybody knows that it's there and how to use it and what the most
[00:44:41.880 --> 00:44:43.480]   effective ways of using it are.
[00:44:43.480 --> 00:44:46.320]   My mom has gave her a couple of Echo dots.
[00:44:46.320 --> 00:44:47.480]   Now she has an Echo show.
[00:44:47.480 --> 00:44:50.080]   And I have, that's, thank you for reminding me.
[00:44:50.080 --> 00:44:54.000]   I've told, and we've made calls on the show, but I'm going to remind her she can use that
[00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:55.200]   drop in feature.
[00:44:55.200 --> 00:44:59.640]   If anything, if she can't reach, you know, can't get up or whatever, use it and reach
[00:44:59.640 --> 00:45:00.640]   me.
[00:45:00.640 --> 00:45:04.880]   And of course, if you have a Google assistant, one of those Google homes, it can call on
[00:45:04.880 --> 00:45:05.880]   other phone.
[00:45:05.880 --> 00:45:06.880]   Yeah.
[00:45:06.880 --> 00:45:08.680]   But you have to set that up ahead of time as well.
[00:45:08.680 --> 00:45:10.680]   So that's worth, worth doing.
[00:45:10.680 --> 00:45:16.160]   And, and if you've got your, I always turn on, hey, Siri on my devices, because I like
[00:45:16.160 --> 00:45:19.560]   that feature, but that's a good reason to have that on as well.
[00:45:19.560 --> 00:45:20.560]   Absolutely.
[00:45:20.560 --> 00:45:25.560]   So of course, this morning I got some, I, I, I, go ahead.
[00:45:25.560 --> 00:45:27.920]   Sorry, you talked about DACA?
[00:45:27.920 --> 00:45:28.920]   Yes.
[00:45:28.920 --> 00:45:29.920]   Yeah.
[00:45:29.920 --> 00:45:30.920]   So, yeah.
[00:45:30.920 --> 00:45:34.880]   So Tim also had a really, really nice email to all of his employees about the deferred
[00:45:34.880 --> 00:45:41.640]   action for childhood arrival, arrivals program, saying that, hey, look, 200, at least 250
[00:45:41.640 --> 00:45:43.600]   of our employees are here under DACA.
[00:45:43.600 --> 00:45:47.080]   Some of them came here as young as two years old, many of them were telling me that they
[00:45:47.080 --> 00:45:50.560]   have no memories of any place other than the United States of America.
[00:45:50.560 --> 00:45:56.080]   And he said, I'm deeply dismayed that 800,000 Americans may soon find themselves cast out
[00:45:56.080 --> 00:45:58.440]   of the only country they've ever called home.
[00:45:58.440 --> 00:46:03.680]   And the last, and promising that he's that Apple as a company is going to work and lobby
[00:46:03.680 --> 00:46:08.080]   representatives of both parties to see that these people are protected.
[00:46:08.080 --> 00:46:12.880]   But the last paragraph is really nice because it's not, it doesn't pussyfoot.
[00:46:12.880 --> 00:46:19.840]   It says, despite this setback for our nation, this setback for our nation, I'm confident
[00:46:19.840 --> 00:46:22.920]   that American values will prevail.
[00:46:22.920 --> 00:46:26.120]   And we will continue our tradition of welcoming immigrants from all nations.
[00:46:26.120 --> 00:46:29.000]   I'll do whatever I can to assure this outcome.
[00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:32.200]   That's, that's pretty strong stuff from a CEO.
[00:46:32.200 --> 00:46:35.440]   That's not, it's not, well, gosh, we want to pretend we want, we'll do right by our
[00:46:35.440 --> 00:46:38.200]   employees and gosh, let's find some solutions.
[00:46:38.200 --> 00:46:43.120]   Let's know this is bad for the country to get rid of this, this program.
[00:46:43.120 --> 00:46:45.280]   This is against American values.
[00:46:45.280 --> 00:46:48.920]   And basically we're basically for welcoming immigrants from everywhere.
[00:46:48.920 --> 00:46:55.880]   And there are one particular powerful person that is seemingly opposed to that idea.
[00:46:55.880 --> 00:47:00.040]   So that's, that's the sort of stuff that I like to see from a company like Apple.
[00:47:00.040 --> 00:47:04.840]   There's, they're so big that when they are silent, they help people do bad things.
[00:47:04.840 --> 00:47:10.120]   So if they, if they feel that this is a wrong thing, I think that their place is, it's not
[00:47:10.120 --> 00:47:11.920]   out of place for them to make a statement like this.
[00:47:11.920 --> 00:47:13.960]   And this is exactly what I was hoping to hear from you.
[00:47:13.960 --> 00:47:15.720]   I got the notification on my phone this morning.
[00:47:15.720 --> 00:47:16.720]   I was so depressed.
[00:47:16.720 --> 00:47:18.560]   I just, it was, I was speechless.
[00:47:18.560 --> 00:47:21.280]   It's just a shameful, shameful thing.
[00:47:21.280 --> 00:47:26.000]   And at this point, all we can hope is that Congress writes this wrong.
[00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:28.920]   These, these children do not deserve this kind of treatment.
[00:47:28.920 --> 00:47:31.920]   What goes back to that interview from last week where Cook said when governments are
[00:47:31.920 --> 00:47:35.360]   advocating their responsibilities, that's the one I want to talk about.
[00:47:35.360 --> 00:47:36.360]   Yeah.
[00:47:36.360 --> 00:47:38.840]   That this is very interesting.
[00:47:38.840 --> 00:47:41.400]   Do you have the quote for that?
[00:47:41.400 --> 00:47:42.400]   Let me see if I can find it.
[00:47:42.400 --> 00:47:43.560]   I don't have it in front of me, but it was.
[00:47:43.560 --> 00:47:44.560]   Do we talk about it last week?
[00:47:44.560 --> 00:47:45.560]   I don't think so.
[00:47:45.560 --> 00:47:46.560]   Yeah.
[00:47:46.560 --> 00:47:47.560]   We did.
[00:47:47.560 --> 00:47:48.560]   Yeah.
[00:47:48.560 --> 00:47:49.560]   Okay.
[00:47:49.560 --> 00:47:53.080]   So it was, yeah, he, he, he said, I'm not sure I would say businesses should step in
[00:47:53.080 --> 00:47:54.160]   where government fails.
[00:47:54.160 --> 00:47:57.040]   That was the fortune, uh, interpretation of it.
[00:47:57.040 --> 00:48:00.960]   But I do think he said, I quote, I think we have a moral responsibility help grow the
[00:48:00.960 --> 00:48:04.080]   economy, grow jobs to contribute to this country and contribute to other countries
[00:48:04.080 --> 00:48:06.520]   we do business in.
[00:48:06.520 --> 00:48:11.680]   And, uh, you know, um, when, yeah, that's the one, the reality.
[00:48:11.680 --> 00:48:12.680]   Yeah.
[00:48:12.680 --> 00:48:13.680]   When, where is it?
[00:48:13.680 --> 00:48:17.520]   The reality is that government for a long period of time has for whatever reason, set
[00:48:17.520 --> 00:48:21.520]   of reasons become less functional and isn't working at the speed that it once was.
[00:48:21.520 --> 00:48:22.520]   Yeah.
[00:48:22.520 --> 00:48:23.520]   Yeah.
[00:48:23.520 --> 00:48:26.720]   It's, I don't think speed is the issue, but okay.
[00:48:26.720 --> 00:48:30.920]   I think Tim has been very, you know, in all of these, he's very diplomatic.
[00:48:30.920 --> 00:48:34.960]   Well, he has to serve like a goodness of the shareholders.
[00:48:34.960 --> 00:48:35.960]   Right.
[00:48:35.960 --> 00:48:37.240]   He can't, he can't be put that political.
[00:48:37.240 --> 00:48:38.240]   Uh, yeah.
[00:48:38.240 --> 00:48:43.880]   Well, but remember that, uh, can, can you ever imagine that the energy industry can have
[00:48:43.880 --> 00:48:47.840]   as much influence over the lives of every citizen of the United States of America as
[00:48:47.840 --> 00:48:53.560]   they do have right now that you can have, and you can have installed as the head of NASA,
[00:48:53.560 --> 00:48:58.000]   somebody who was not a scientist, basically has no experience that way, but can toe the
[00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:02.240]   line about making sure that, uh, that the environmental research is curtailed.
[00:49:02.240 --> 00:49:07.760]   And it's, if, uh, if the industry, if the industry industry can have that kind of influence
[00:49:07.760 --> 00:49:12.840]   then perhaps the technology industry or any other industry with that kind of clout has
[00:49:12.840 --> 00:49:16.480]   the responsibility to be the only force that can fight it.
[00:49:16.480 --> 00:49:17.720]   So I don't know.
[00:49:17.720 --> 00:49:22.840]   I'm just, it, I, I, I, there are a lot of good things that big companies can do.
[00:49:22.840 --> 00:49:26.240]   Again, they, they are under no obligation to do any of them.
[00:49:26.240 --> 00:49:30.240]   But, uh, when they, when the power ball got three quarters for trillion dollars a couple
[00:49:30.240 --> 00:49:34.240]   of weeks ago, a lot of people were thinking about dreaming about, Hey, what if I, I'm going
[00:49:34.240 --> 00:49:38.040]   to buy three speedboats and crash them into three other speedboats that I bought.
[00:49:38.040 --> 00:49:42.920]   My, my, my dream is like, no, I'm going to not tell any, any electric official how to
[00:49:42.920 --> 00:49:43.920]   vote.
[00:49:43.920 --> 00:49:48.600]   I'm just going to make it very, very much known that if, and if the energy industry backs
[00:49:48.600 --> 00:49:52.880]   their other backs and opposing candidate in a primary because of them voting their conscience,
[00:49:52.880 --> 00:49:57.800]   I will replace whatever money I will match dollar for dollar plus a hundred bucks, whatever
[00:49:57.800 --> 00:50:02.080]   the energy industry was doing because this is a force that needs to be countered.
[00:50:02.080 --> 00:50:06.160]   And sometimes it's, it's a, again, another big company, another big industry is the only
[00:50:06.160 --> 00:50:07.160]   one who can do that.
[00:50:07.160 --> 00:50:10.520]   I should point out that there are some CEOs who are a little more strongly worded.
[00:50:10.520 --> 00:50:11.880]   Mark Zuckerberg's post this morning.
[00:50:11.880 --> 00:50:14.320]   This is a sad day for our country.
[00:50:14.320 --> 00:50:16.120]   The decision to end up has not just wrong.
[00:50:16.120 --> 00:50:19.240]   It's particularly cruel to offer young people the American dream, encourage them to come
[00:50:19.240 --> 00:50:24.520]   out of the shadows and trust their government and then punish them for it.
[00:50:24.520 --> 00:50:26.200]   So that's a, that's a little stronger.
[00:50:26.200 --> 00:50:30.040]   I'll, I'll say that this, this is what sickens me about immigration policy.
[00:50:30.040 --> 00:50:36.240]   We've been seeing this year that it's not the, as, as this man so delicately put it, the
[00:50:36.240 --> 00:50:38.640]   bad ombre's that are being caught.
[00:50:38.640 --> 00:50:43.000]   It's the people who have been, when they're, when, who are been asked, you're going to
[00:50:43.000 --> 00:50:47.680]   have to come up and show up for regular meetings with an agent to make sure that we know who
[00:50:47.680 --> 00:50:49.200]   you are and where you are.
[00:50:49.200 --> 00:50:52.960]   It's these people who are coming to those meetings who are working for it.
[00:50:52.960 --> 00:50:56.480]   The people who are, when they're, the government says, Hey, trust us, we'll let you stay in
[00:50:56.480 --> 00:50:57.480]   the country.
[00:50:57.480 --> 00:51:01.840]   If you enjoy this program, it's the people who have let their names be known, let their
[00:51:01.840 --> 00:51:05.240]   faces be known, who come when called, who do what they're asked.
[00:51:05.240 --> 00:51:08.080]   Those are the people who are getting rounded up and sent away.
[00:51:08.080 --> 00:51:09.720]   And that just kind of sickens me.
[00:51:09.720 --> 00:51:11.360]   It isn't, I guess a surprise.
[00:51:11.360 --> 00:51:16.760]   I mean, Trump ran on the whole anchor baby BS that these kids were somehow being used
[00:51:16.760 --> 00:51:17.760]   by their parents.
[00:51:17.760 --> 00:51:18.760]   Particularly ironic.
[00:51:18.760 --> 00:51:19.760]   Huh?
[00:51:19.760 --> 00:51:24.040]   I was just going to say one of the time I go ahead to the Canadian may speak.
[00:51:24.040 --> 00:51:27.300]   I was just going to say like one of the particular ironies is seeing the people who were very
[00:51:27.300 --> 00:51:31.720]   supportive of some of those policies now being hit by them when it's members of their own
[00:51:31.720 --> 00:51:37.320]   family and not realizing that the values they were exposing were going to hurt them.
[00:51:37.320 --> 00:51:38.720]   You know, hurt them as well.
[00:51:38.720 --> 00:51:39.720]   Yeah.
[00:51:39.720 --> 00:51:40.720]   Yeah.
[00:51:40.720 --> 00:51:46.080]   Also, I mean, he, he also said that he's going to protect, he's going to protect, he's
[00:51:46.080 --> 00:51:48.080]   going to protect LGBTQ.
[00:51:48.080 --> 00:51:49.080]   No, I know.
[00:51:49.080 --> 00:51:52.600]   He said he said they wouldn't raise, he wouldn't touch those security.
[00:51:52.600 --> 00:51:53.600]   He went back on that.
[00:51:53.600 --> 00:51:55.480]   Can't he also go back on the immigration?
[00:51:55.480 --> 00:51:56.480]   Yeah.
[00:51:56.480 --> 00:52:00.280]   Well, can't he go back on a promise of his forever people in any, in any event?
[00:52:00.280 --> 00:52:05.600]   The, the, I do hope, although when you talk about Congress doing anything, hope is a big
[00:52:05.600 --> 00:52:09.680]   part of that word, but I do hope that Congress, they have six months to, to change this.
[00:52:09.680 --> 00:52:11.240]   And I hope that they do something.
[00:52:11.240 --> 00:52:18.960]   It's interesting though, this is one issue that Silicon Valley has not been careful not
[00:52:18.960 --> 00:52:19.960]   to say.
[00:52:19.960 --> 00:52:24.440]   I mean, they, this, because a lot of these kids work at these companies, hundreds, hundreds
[00:52:24.440 --> 00:52:26.760]   work for Facebook, hundreds work for Apple.
[00:52:26.760 --> 00:52:30.120]   And so they're, they're, they're really defending their employees when they're talking about
[00:52:30.120 --> 00:52:31.120]   this.
[00:52:31.120 --> 00:52:32.120]   Yeah.
[00:52:32.120 --> 00:52:33.120]   Let's see.
[00:52:33.120 --> 00:52:37.400]   Oh, it's going to say that one more cap on that is that Tim Cook, the cook doctrine
[00:52:37.400 --> 00:52:41.200]   originally, people use that to describe his effect on Apple where their Apple is going
[00:52:41.200 --> 00:52:44.680]   to provide differentiated experiences and control core technologies.
[00:52:44.680 --> 00:52:47.880]   And now we're seeing this whole new cook doctrine where it really is that sort of RFK
[00:52:47.880 --> 00:52:52.760]   golden path and he wants to make sure he lays as many bricks as, as came before him, which
[00:52:52.760 --> 00:52:56.120]   is a real interesting thing to see.
[00:52:56.120 --> 00:52:58.120]   Yeah.
[00:52:58.120 --> 00:53:02.400]   Apple also defending the open, open internet in a letter to the FCC as long as we're on
[00:53:02.400 --> 00:53:05.840]   the, the, the politics part of the writing a lot.
[00:53:05.840 --> 00:53:07.360]   They've been, they've been very active.
[00:53:07.360 --> 00:53:10.240]   And you know, I, I really wonder if this is going to have any impact.
[00:53:10.240 --> 00:53:13.640]   A Jip pie, the chairman of the FCC has already kind of implied, I don't care what anybody
[00:53:13.640 --> 00:53:14.720]   says.
[00:53:14.720 --> 00:53:18.680]   I don't care how many millions of comments we get in support of it.
[00:53:18.680 --> 00:53:20.320]   We're not going to do anything about it.
[00:53:20.320 --> 00:53:21.880]   Well, listen, we'll see now.
[00:53:21.880 --> 00:53:22.880]   Yeah.
[00:53:22.880 --> 00:53:25.040]   But I'm glad that they wrote the letter.
[00:53:25.040 --> 00:53:31.280]   It's interesting because the people who most benefit from the elimination of net neutrality
[00:53:31.280 --> 00:53:32.280]   are the incumbents.
[00:53:32.280 --> 00:53:37.240]   The big companies already who've made their money, they can pull a ladder up behind them.
[00:53:37.240 --> 00:53:42.760]   But it really impacts startups, companies that want to use the internet that may not
[00:53:42.760 --> 00:53:48.040]   have the money or the, wherewithal to get a high speed lane on the internet who are
[00:53:48.040 --> 00:53:49.200]   going to suffer.
[00:53:49.200 --> 00:53:53.840]   So it was, you know, if Apple's not acting in its, in its own interest when it says,
[00:53:53.840 --> 00:53:57.200]   we want to protect the open internet, except that they are acting in the interest of all
[00:53:57.200 --> 00:54:00.880]   of us trying to preserve net neutrality.
[00:54:00.880 --> 00:54:05.360]   And also these public comments are useful to the people, the organizations that are fighting
[00:54:05.360 --> 00:54:11.760]   a legal challenge against the end of net neutrality, because again, it's public, the FCC is required
[00:54:11.760 --> 00:54:13.040]   to get public comment.
[00:54:13.040 --> 00:54:15.720]   They're also required to share that with anybody who requests it.
[00:54:15.720 --> 00:54:21.640]   So if there, if people, if an organization wants to attack a certain argument that the
[00:54:21.640 --> 00:54:26.520]   FCC is making about why they are not supporting net neutrality, they can point to all this
[00:54:26.520 --> 00:54:31.600]   stuff and say, well, look, we've got here, here are, here, here are comments from every
[00:54:31.600 --> 00:54:35.280]   single leader of the internet right now saying that this is a bad thing, that you're,
[00:54:35.280 --> 00:54:36.280]   pull a crap here.
[00:54:36.280 --> 00:54:41.240]   So when you're saying that, that it's going to address a shortfall in the ability of independent,
[00:54:41.240 --> 00:54:46.160]   of regular consumers to get access to the internet, here are again, 300,000 people who
[00:54:46.160 --> 00:54:50.080]   sent you emails saying that this is not how we use this is how we use the internet and
[00:54:50.080 --> 00:54:51.720]   it would not affect them.
[00:54:51.720 --> 00:54:53.600]   It would not improve their lives in that way.
[00:54:53.600 --> 00:54:57.680]   So the, so the FCC can do whatever they want.
[00:54:57.680 --> 00:55:02.240]   But if they can't be swayed by public opinion, then perhaps lawyers and a federal judge at
[00:55:02.240 --> 00:55:07.240]   some point will say, no, you're not, you're not going to do that.
[00:55:07.240 --> 00:55:15.800]   Oh, by the way, speaking of this essential phone, which I was booting up, I just want
[00:55:15.800 --> 00:55:21.240]   to point out the notch because we think the notch will also be part of the iPhone experience,
[00:55:21.240 --> 00:55:22.240]   right?
[00:55:22.240 --> 00:55:23.240]   Yep.
[00:55:23.240 --> 00:55:24.240]   Yeah.
[00:55:24.240 --> 00:55:25.240]   You did that.
[00:55:25.240 --> 00:55:26.240]   Look, now it's the essential.
[00:55:26.240 --> 00:55:27.880]   I said, oh, you know, that's, this is not the iPhone eight, but it's close and people start
[00:55:27.880 --> 00:55:28.880]   making fun of me.
[00:55:28.880 --> 00:55:30.200]   And now I'm going to be fun to say.
[00:55:30.200 --> 00:55:34.600]   But the point on this, and I guess it's true, the iPhone is that the bar at the top of the
[00:55:34.600 --> 00:55:37.480]   phone on an Android is rarely used.
[00:55:37.480 --> 00:55:40.440]   I mean, it's the notifications are to the left and the right of it.
[00:55:40.440 --> 00:55:41.440]   Is that the case also?
[00:55:41.440 --> 00:55:45.360]   Yeah, it's pretty much the only thing you're losing with a notch is that is the time of
[00:55:45.360 --> 00:55:49.280]   day and presumably Apple has a way around that.
[00:55:49.280 --> 00:55:53.680]   Yeah, they can easily split it left and right, put the time in the corner and use network
[00:55:53.680 --> 00:55:54.680]   notifications.
[00:55:54.680 --> 00:55:59.720]   It's a much, it's an even better situation for Apple than for Android because with Android,
[00:55:59.720 --> 00:56:02.760]   you know, notification can put an app icon up there for us with Apple.
[00:56:02.760 --> 00:56:04.920]   They just use it for hard notifications.
[00:56:04.920 --> 00:56:10.320]   It's a Bloomberg had a good rundown, I think today or yesterday about things, but basically
[00:56:10.320 --> 00:56:14.960]   that they have an article in which they claim to have seen the phone itself.
[00:56:14.960 --> 00:56:19.920]   I don't know whether that's through hardware or through photos, but there is the phrase
[00:56:19.920 --> 00:56:22.800]   that based on things that we have actually seen.
[00:56:22.800 --> 00:56:26.800]   And they're talking about how, for instance, the home button is going to, if the home button
[00:56:26.800 --> 00:56:30.400]   is not going to be there, basically, if the replacement for the home button is going to
[00:56:30.400 --> 00:56:33.960]   be the swipe up from the bottom of the screen action, that's going to end a bunch of new
[00:56:33.960 --> 00:56:40.240]   behaviors that turn apps into more of a polymer-less card sort of layout than anything else.
[00:56:40.240 --> 00:56:42.600]   So here's the advantage.
[00:56:42.600 --> 00:56:48.640]   If you want to see it, this is an iPhone 7 and you see it's physically bigger, but the
[00:56:48.640 --> 00:56:51.720]   screen is not bigger than the essential phone.
[00:56:51.720 --> 00:56:56.040]   So getting rid of the bezels, even if you have to do something as kind of compromising
[00:56:56.040 --> 00:57:01.120]   as put a camera notch in there, really does make a appreciable difference in the size
[00:57:01.120 --> 00:57:02.640]   of the phone without switching the screen.
[00:57:02.640 --> 00:57:05.720]   And one of the debates, I'm assuming it was internally earlier, is whether you own the
[00:57:05.720 --> 00:57:07.120]   ears or you hide the ears.
[00:57:07.120 --> 00:57:09.480]   And I think you make the bar black.
[00:57:09.480 --> 00:57:13.400]   Yeah, I think you own the ears because that makes a display really like an infinity display.
[00:57:13.400 --> 00:57:14.400]   Yeah.
[00:57:14.400 --> 00:57:18.080]   Also, because remember that this is the new one we'll have an OLED display and on an OLED
[00:57:18.080 --> 00:57:19.920]   display, black is black.
[00:57:19.920 --> 00:57:24.000]   Black is not a backlit black pixel.
[00:57:24.000 --> 00:57:26.000]   Black is no light, no nothing.
[00:57:26.000 --> 00:57:28.880]   So you will just see the time in the upper corner.
[00:57:28.880 --> 00:57:32.080]   You will just see the signal strength in the upper corner.
[00:57:32.080 --> 00:57:38.400]   It's not as though it'll, I wonder if Apple will keep that lip for most people.
[00:57:38.400 --> 00:57:41.440]   I don't know what their aesthetic would be, but black is black.
[00:57:41.440 --> 00:57:43.320]   They will be able to get rid of that if they want to.
[00:57:43.320 --> 00:57:45.840]   Don't get a white face, Diphon, though.
[00:57:45.840 --> 00:57:46.840]   Well you can.
[00:57:46.840 --> 00:57:51.440]   Well, no, well, the white face one looks really good, but you, Steve Strott and Smith, put
[00:57:51.440 --> 00:57:55.120]   up some of the frameworks that they're going to give developers to let them sort of control
[00:57:55.120 --> 00:57:58.720]   the notch, the status bar on the notched phones.
[00:57:58.720 --> 00:58:01.360]   And Apple's is way wider because it doesn't just have the camera, it has the earpiece,
[00:58:01.360 --> 00:58:05.240]   the camera and the new 3D sensor array.
[00:58:05.240 --> 00:58:07.480]   So it's going to be going across the top of it.
[00:58:07.480 --> 00:58:09.600]   But I think, you know, we'll get used to it.
[00:58:09.600 --> 00:58:12.760]   It's a different aesthetic than what we've had from Apple before and I'm looking forward
[00:58:12.760 --> 00:58:13.760]   to something different.
[00:58:13.760 --> 00:58:14.760]   Yeah.
[00:58:14.760 --> 00:58:19.000]   I think Bloomberg said that internally they refer to those two visible tabs as the ears
[00:58:19.000 --> 00:58:20.000]   of the screen.
[00:58:20.000 --> 00:58:21.000]   Yeah, there's good.
[00:58:21.000 --> 00:58:22.000]   I like it.
[00:58:22.000 --> 00:58:23.000]   Which would be pretty adorable.
[00:58:23.000 --> 00:58:24.000]   Yeah.
[00:58:24.000 --> 00:58:31.520]   Retoactively, this is part of the long discussion about how unfortunate it is that so much of
[00:58:31.520 --> 00:58:36.400]   the conversation about technology is about silly nitpicky things that don't matter whatsoever.
[00:58:36.400 --> 00:58:39.560]   There are going to be people that are going to say, "Oh, well, Apple's totally ruined
[00:58:39.560 --> 00:58:42.360]   the aesthetic of the phone by having this notch visible."
[00:58:42.360 --> 00:58:47.640]   Just like people were saying, "Oh, I can't take the Motorola smartwatch seriously because
[00:58:47.640 --> 00:58:49.680]   it has that flat tire at the bottom."
[00:58:49.680 --> 00:58:52.280]   Or "Oh, isn't it horrible that Apple has a camera bump?"
[00:58:52.280 --> 00:58:54.280]   And I thought that Apple would never do it.
[00:58:54.280 --> 00:58:55.680]   None of these things matter.
[00:58:55.680 --> 00:58:58.240]   If they're such a bad thing, don't buy the phone.
[00:58:58.240 --> 00:58:59.240]   That's fine.
[00:58:59.240 --> 00:59:05.240]   But it's not as though they're making a fundamental, practical, functional change that will affect
[00:59:05.240 --> 00:59:06.720]   your life every single day.
[00:59:06.720 --> 00:59:07.720]   This is just a thing.
[00:59:07.720 --> 00:59:11.360]   But in my defense, though, Andy, in my defense, it was marketing Renee that drew Umbrage at
[00:59:11.360 --> 00:59:13.240]   that because they called it the 360.
[00:59:13.240 --> 00:59:17.160]   And if they called this the iPhone notch list, I'd be making just as much fun of it.
[00:59:17.160 --> 00:59:23.000]   We're going to take a break, come back with more a friend of mine who's an Apple iPhone
[00:59:23.000 --> 00:59:29.400]   developer has received some disconcerting news from Apple about his apps.
[00:59:29.400 --> 00:59:32.600]   Part of I think Apple's attempt to clean up the app store, but are they going too far?
[00:59:32.600 --> 00:59:33.840]   We'll talk about that in a lot more.
[00:59:33.840 --> 00:59:37.000]   But first, a word from texture.
[00:59:37.000 --> 00:59:41.000]   I see on my texture app they're celebrating their second anniversary.
[00:59:41.000 --> 00:59:43.840]   They've got a nice referral plan in there because of that.
[00:59:43.840 --> 00:59:44.840]   What is texture?
[00:59:44.840 --> 00:59:48.600]   The thing of it is like Netflix for magazines.
[00:59:48.600 --> 00:59:50.520]   Over 200 of the world's best magazines.
[00:59:50.520 --> 00:59:51.520]   This is my texture.
[00:59:51.520 --> 00:59:57.040]   I love this because I've always got something great to read on my iPad.
[00:59:57.040 --> 00:59:58.920]   Texture has curated sections.
[00:59:58.920 --> 01:00:01.160]   This is new and noteworthy stories.
[01:00:01.160 --> 01:00:05.040]   So stories that I might not actually read because they're magazines I don't know about
[01:00:05.040 --> 01:00:10.360]   like health or outside magazine, Newsweek, Bloomberg Business Week.
[01:00:10.360 --> 01:00:16.040]   This is the top 10 reads from GQ, The New Yorker Time, Men's Health, Readers Digest, Readers
[01:00:16.040 --> 01:00:17.040]   Digest.
[01:00:17.040 --> 01:00:18.040]   Who knew?
[01:00:18.040 --> 01:00:19.040]   Look at that.
[01:00:19.040 --> 01:00:24.280]   13 Mind-Blowing Discovery Scientists Made This Year.
[01:00:24.280 --> 01:00:27.920]   What's great about the curated stuff is it's not necessarily stuff you would...
[01:00:27.920 --> 01:00:31.800]   I don't typically open the Readers Digest, but I've got it on here.
[01:00:31.800 --> 01:00:34.240]   I've got everything on here.
[01:00:34.240 --> 01:00:38.640]   Including all the magazines I love, Top Stories in Health and Fitness and Entertainment.
[01:00:38.640 --> 01:00:40.680]   My library is rich.
[01:00:40.680 --> 01:00:46.000]   These magazines can automatically be downloaded so that I can read them on a plane or anywhere
[01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:47.680]   offline.
[01:00:47.680 --> 01:00:50.840]   I have to say, as you know, I'm a kind of a shutter bug.
[01:00:50.840 --> 01:00:55.240]   Shutterbug magazine is one of many photographic magazines I get.
[01:00:55.240 --> 01:00:59.000]   National Geographic be another example.
[01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:05.640]   As good as a magazine looks, the photos on your iPad or your phone or your tablet look
[01:01:05.640 --> 01:01:08.040]   10 times better.
[01:01:08.040 --> 01:01:09.280]   You can zoom in.
[01:01:09.280 --> 01:01:11.320]   You can really take a look at those.
[01:01:11.320 --> 01:01:12.320]   See the detail?
[01:01:12.320 --> 01:01:14.760]   This is as close to the original photo as can be.
[01:01:14.760 --> 01:01:16.920]   Not some screened printed version.
[01:01:16.920 --> 01:01:21.080]   If you're a photo buff, texture is amazing.
[01:01:21.080 --> 01:01:22.080]   Sound and Vision.
[01:01:22.080 --> 01:01:24.920]   There's a magazine I probably wouldn't subscribe to, but you notice I download it because it's
[01:01:24.920 --> 01:01:25.920]   easy.
[01:01:25.920 --> 01:01:26.920]   It's free.
[01:01:26.920 --> 01:01:27.920]   It's part of the deal.
[01:01:27.920 --> 01:01:28.920]   It's part of my subscription.
[01:01:28.920 --> 01:01:33.040]   The NFL Preview is coming at Atlantic Magazine Travel and Leisure every week.
[01:01:33.040 --> 01:01:36.560]   There's something great in The New Yorker, but I always felt guilty when I got the paper
[01:01:36.560 --> 01:01:38.840]   edition because I wouldn't read it all.
[01:01:38.840 --> 01:01:43.560]   It would pile up and at my coffee table would be buckling under the weight of all the magazines.
[01:01:43.560 --> 01:01:47.560]   Now with texture, you get them all and bits weigh nothing.
[01:01:47.560 --> 01:01:54.640]   One low flat fee, 200 magazines, one of Apple's top 2016 iPad apps.
[01:01:54.640 --> 01:01:55.640]   You know what?
[01:01:55.640 --> 01:01:58.880]   For the price of a couple of subscriptions, you can have every magazine.
[01:01:58.880 --> 01:02:06.440]   Every magazine you'd want on your smartphone or tablet, always there as you travel.
[01:02:06.440 --> 01:02:08.920]   It's what your iPad was made for.
[01:02:08.920 --> 01:02:11.520]   Texture is offering a 14-day free trial right now.
[01:02:11.520 --> 01:02:21.160]   If you go to texture.com/twit, T-E-X-T-U-R-E, texture.com/twit.
[01:02:21.160 --> 01:02:23.800]   I don't know how to convince you to do this.
[01:02:23.800 --> 01:02:28.040]   If you haven't done it already, this thing is awesome.
[01:02:28.040 --> 01:02:30.160]   It's what your tablet or phone was made for.
[01:02:30.160 --> 01:02:32.960]   By the way, you can put it on up to five devices.
[01:02:32.960 --> 01:02:33.960]   Texture.
[01:02:33.960 --> 01:02:34.960]   It's awesome.
[01:02:34.960 --> 01:02:36.960]   It's a cool thing.
[01:02:36.960 --> 01:02:37.960]   Give it a try.
[01:02:37.960 --> 01:02:40.360]   If you haven't, give it a try.
[01:02:40.360 --> 01:02:42.580]   If you have, celebrate their second anniversary.
[01:02:42.580 --> 01:02:49.140]   Go to your texture app, you'll see a pretty nice offer for sharing texture with your friends.
[01:02:49.140 --> 01:02:52.360]   Let's see.
[01:02:52.360 --> 01:02:57.400]   I guess one of the big things Apple will talk about next Tuesday will be Augmented Reality,
[01:02:57.400 --> 01:02:58.560]   ARKit.
[01:02:58.560 --> 01:03:03.920]   Let me ask you once again, am I at any risk that I'm going to have to buy Robert Skobel
[01:03:03.920 --> 01:03:06.000]   dinner in Paris?
[01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:07.000]   We have a bet.
[01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:09.760]   He said there was going to be a clear iPhone this year.
[01:03:09.760 --> 01:03:11.520]   If it's based on what was in his head, maybe.
[01:03:11.520 --> 01:03:13.840]   If it's based on what he actually said, then I think you're in the clear.
[01:03:13.840 --> 01:03:17.280]   It's not a clear iPhone in the offing.
[01:03:17.280 --> 01:03:18.280]   No.
[01:03:18.280 --> 01:03:20.080]   It's clear because the screen is so damn big.
[01:03:20.080 --> 01:03:21.600]   It looks like you can see through it.
[01:03:21.600 --> 01:03:22.600]   Same as it's fun.
[01:03:22.600 --> 01:03:23.600]   Look at that.
[01:03:23.600 --> 01:03:29.700]   See, if you look in the AR app, that is a kid using a current iPhone and looking at their
[01:03:29.700 --> 01:03:33.760]   lawn and their pathway, but on it is a truck or something.
[01:03:33.760 --> 01:03:35.000]   That's what AR is going to do.
[01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:37.640]   We're seeing some of the new AR apps.
[01:03:37.640 --> 01:03:39.560]   Jiffy walking in the air.
[01:03:39.560 --> 01:03:44.720]   We just found out that Matthew Pansarino gives his daughter an iPhone upside down.
[01:03:44.720 --> 01:03:47.080]   What is wrong with you, Matthew?
[01:03:47.080 --> 01:03:48.440]   What are you doing, Matthew Pansarino?
[01:03:48.440 --> 01:03:50.640]   Right in the text.
[01:03:50.640 --> 01:03:54.920]   To his credit, we've learned that he's the sort of parent that doesn't say you're holding
[01:03:54.920 --> 01:03:55.920]   it wrong.
[01:03:55.920 --> 01:03:59.040]   He's better than Steve Jobs in that effect.
[01:03:59.040 --> 01:04:01.520]   He says, "Hold it, however you use it."
[01:04:01.520 --> 01:04:03.280]   Hold it any way you want to do.
[01:04:03.280 --> 01:04:05.400]   If it's working, go ahead.
[01:04:05.400 --> 01:04:10.800]   So IKEA's, of course, when you think about augmented reality, IKEA's is the obvious.
[01:04:10.800 --> 01:04:11.800]   That makes sense.
[01:04:11.800 --> 01:04:12.800]   This is from us.
[01:04:12.800 --> 01:04:13.800]   I've got to try that out.
[01:04:13.800 --> 01:04:14.800]   It's actually a lot more fun than you think.
[01:04:14.800 --> 01:04:16.760]   There's not a lot of content in it yet.
[01:04:16.760 --> 01:04:21.120]   You basically put down a chair and you can drop it and you can change the type of chair
[01:04:21.120 --> 01:04:23.040]   and how it looks and where it goes.
[01:04:23.040 --> 01:04:26.120]   They don't do wall detection yet, so you've got to make sure you have a nice big empty
[01:04:26.120 --> 01:04:27.120]   flat surface.
[01:04:27.120 --> 01:04:30.680]   Maybe that's the kind of thing that the new iPhone might be better at.
[01:04:30.680 --> 01:04:33.240]   Maybe they have different features, depending on which phone you're using.
[01:04:33.240 --> 01:04:34.240]   It's entirely possible.
[01:04:34.240 --> 01:04:36.560]   I was trying it on an iPhone 7, so you had to exactly that.
[01:04:36.560 --> 01:04:38.800]   You could put it in, you could rotate it, you could change the color, you could change
[01:04:38.800 --> 01:04:40.280]   the style.
[01:04:40.280 --> 01:04:43.040]   It did a really good job with the lighting, it did a really good job with the placement,
[01:04:43.040 --> 01:04:45.600]   it looked really stuck on the floor.
[01:04:45.600 --> 01:04:46.600]   It was fun.
[01:04:46.600 --> 01:04:48.840]   It's limited in what you can do with it now.
[01:04:48.840 --> 01:04:50.920]   It was also one of the more conservative apps I've got to try.
[01:04:50.920 --> 01:04:53.880]   It was very much as you would expect.
[01:04:53.880 --> 01:04:56.280]   IKEA, AR app to work.
[01:04:56.280 --> 01:05:00.400]   It's panzerina says, "2,000 items available at launch."
[01:05:00.400 --> 01:05:03.040]   The version you were playing with and he's playing with this.
[01:05:03.040 --> 01:05:04.040]   Really?
[01:05:04.040 --> 01:05:05.040]   Yeah.
[01:05:05.040 --> 01:05:07.840]   There's going to be, remember that we're all seeing demos.
[01:05:07.840 --> 01:05:12.080]   I think I talked about this a week ago or two ago, where we're not seeing demos of AR
[01:05:12.080 --> 01:05:13.320]   kit not working well.
[01:05:13.320 --> 01:05:17.240]   We're seeing demos of things that are working great.
[01:05:17.240 --> 01:05:18.920]   That's going to be a big challenge for Apple.
[01:05:18.920 --> 01:05:23.440]   As wonderful as this technology is, they have to make sure that they set expectations correctly
[01:05:23.440 --> 01:05:26.160]   that no, you're not going to necessarily be able to.
[01:05:26.160 --> 01:05:30.880]   It may not detect a wall correctly, or it may not necessarily scale correctly the first
[01:05:30.880 --> 01:05:32.920]   time.
[01:05:32.920 --> 01:05:38.300]   When you first launch the app, you don't just lift it up like a camera and instantly it
[01:05:38.300 --> 01:05:40.920]   sees where the floor is or where the table is.
[01:05:40.920 --> 01:05:42.400]   That's why there are games.
[01:05:42.400 --> 01:05:46.200]   It wasn't until my third or fourth demo that I realized that there were a couple of games
[01:05:46.200 --> 01:05:50.240]   that were tricking me into waving the phone around when it was actually trying to get
[01:05:50.240 --> 01:05:53.800]   a sense of what the room was like.
[01:05:53.800 --> 01:05:59.920]   If that's disruptive for people, then Apple is going to have to prepare people for that.
[01:05:59.920 --> 01:06:04.800]   This isn't a magic technology, it just allows a lot of magical features to happen.
[01:06:04.800 --> 01:06:07.080]   Expectations are going to have to be set correctly.
[01:06:07.080 --> 01:06:08.600]   I want a cupcake now.
[01:06:08.600 --> 01:06:09.840]   There's very different approaches too.
[01:06:09.840 --> 01:06:14.000]   Some of them are very quote unquote honest where they show you the dots that they're using.
[01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:18.080]   As you move it around, you see the dots start to form on the flat surfaces that it's identifying.
[01:06:18.080 --> 01:06:20.760]   You actually get to see the sausage being made for the app.
[01:06:20.760 --> 01:06:23.760]   Other ones are trying to create an experience where they're like, "Oh, find the bird."
[01:06:23.760 --> 01:06:27.200]   You try to move the camera around until you find the bird, and that's actually you letting
[01:06:27.200 --> 01:06:29.720]   it scan the room while it's doing the setup.
[01:06:29.720 --> 01:06:32.400]   We should see a bunch of really interesting approaches.
[01:06:32.400 --> 01:06:35.920]   It also made me think about how this is going to lead to, even if you're not interested
[01:06:35.920 --> 01:06:40.240]   in ARKit, how it's going to lead to improvements for pretty much every phone.
[01:06:40.240 --> 01:06:45.560]   One of the things that iPhones don't do...
[01:06:45.560 --> 01:06:54.760]   They're good at low light, they're good at dynamic range threat.
[01:06:54.760 --> 01:06:56.800]   They're not fantastic at it.
[01:06:56.800 --> 01:07:01.280]   However, if you're going to ask people to go into their living room and set down furniture
[01:07:01.280 --> 01:07:02.280]   or go into...
[01:07:02.280 --> 01:07:03.280]   Play your...
[01:07:03.280 --> 01:07:04.280]   Your...
[01:07:04.280 --> 01:07:06.320]   Their kids going to be playing a game inside an arbitrary living room.
[01:07:06.320 --> 01:07:07.920]   These are not well lit spaces.
[01:07:07.920 --> 01:07:08.920]   These are not...
[01:07:08.920 --> 01:07:11.760]   If they're trying to put a sofa in a corner where there is no light, or if they're trying
[01:07:11.760 --> 01:07:16.080]   to figure out which of these 18 lamps do I want to put into that corner, it's probably
[01:07:16.080 --> 01:07:17.520]   a dark corner to begin with.
[01:07:17.520 --> 01:07:22.480]   So, they're going to have to improve the camera hardware or at least tune the image processor
[01:07:22.480 --> 01:07:25.960]   to be able to handle that stuff better.
[01:07:25.960 --> 01:07:30.000]   So many reasons why the new top of the line iPhone is going to be so interesting.
[01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:35.480]   One of them is going to be to see how many things they changed simply to accommodate
[01:07:35.480 --> 01:07:38.600]   ARKit and to optimize it for this new kit.
[01:07:38.600 --> 01:07:41.240]   Let's see, here's a food network.
[01:07:41.240 --> 01:07:44.120]   I think cooking makes a lot of sense.
[01:07:44.120 --> 01:07:48.680]   This is actually a cupcake decoration app.
[01:07:48.680 --> 01:07:50.960]   So you place and decorate virtual desserts.
[01:07:50.960 --> 01:07:52.600]   Makes me so hungry.
[01:07:52.600 --> 01:07:53.600]   I know.
[01:07:53.600 --> 01:07:57.400]   It's a very bad idea for my diet.
[01:07:57.400 --> 01:07:59.560]   So it's just a table with...
[01:07:59.560 --> 01:08:00.560]   I don't know.
[01:08:00.560 --> 01:08:01.560]   The decorations are on the table.
[01:08:01.560 --> 01:08:03.840]   I'm not sure what's going to happen here.
[01:08:03.840 --> 01:08:05.320]   Oh, we found a plate.
[01:08:05.320 --> 01:08:06.320]   We found a plate.
[01:08:06.320 --> 01:08:07.320]   Oh, I see.
[01:08:07.320 --> 01:08:08.320]   It's looking for a plate.
[01:08:08.320 --> 01:08:09.320]   So you need to have a plate.
[01:08:09.320 --> 01:08:11.280]   And then you put the cupcake on the plate.
[01:08:11.280 --> 01:08:12.280]   And didn't get the...
[01:08:12.280 --> 01:08:13.280]   It didn't place it.
[01:08:13.280 --> 01:08:14.840]   It incised it correctly for that plate.
[01:08:14.840 --> 01:08:17.280]   You had it in the way you still had it on.
[01:08:17.280 --> 01:08:19.280]   But you know, I don't think people will mind that.
[01:08:19.280 --> 01:08:22.560]   I don't know if they had one there, but they had a really good one where it would show
[01:08:22.560 --> 01:08:23.560]   you different lipsticks.
[01:08:23.560 --> 01:08:25.600]   And it was really good at sticking the lipstick on your mouth.
[01:08:25.600 --> 01:08:28.400]   So you could basically flip through it and you would see.
[01:08:28.400 --> 01:08:31.280]   And then it would put virtual windows up with all the different makeup treatments that
[01:08:31.280 --> 01:08:33.240]   you could walk around and look at.
[01:08:33.240 --> 01:08:34.240]   There were some odd choices.
[01:08:34.240 --> 01:08:36.400]   Like sometimes they would put flat 2D models.
[01:08:36.400 --> 01:08:37.720]   Is that a 3D models on tables?
[01:08:37.720 --> 01:08:38.920]   And it would look really wrong.
[01:08:38.920 --> 01:08:40.560]   And I imagine it's early days.
[01:08:40.560 --> 01:08:42.120]   But oh, yeah, that's one.
[01:08:42.120 --> 01:08:43.120]   There you go.
[01:08:43.120 --> 01:08:44.120]   Yeah.
[01:08:44.120 --> 01:08:45.120]   Is that Sephora?
[01:08:45.120 --> 01:08:46.120]   It's one of the...
[01:08:46.120 --> 01:08:47.120]   Yeah, I got to try that one too.
[01:08:47.120 --> 01:08:48.120]   And that was a...
[01:08:48.120 --> 01:08:49.120]   I look really good and teal.
[01:08:49.120 --> 01:08:50.120]   I didn't think that would be the case.
[01:08:50.120 --> 01:08:52.480]   I think it's an interesting demo, I have to say.
[01:08:52.480 --> 01:08:54.360]   And I could see it there be an audience for it.
[01:08:54.360 --> 01:08:56.120]   Well, just mouth matching is interesting technology.
[01:08:56.120 --> 01:08:58.280]   It's doing a very good job.
[01:08:58.280 --> 01:08:59.680]   I was wondering about that.
[01:08:59.680 --> 01:09:01.680]   I can't get an answer.
[01:09:01.680 --> 01:09:05.680]   Does ARKit do face matching and face-match mapping?
[01:09:05.680 --> 01:09:06.680]   I don't know.
[01:09:06.680 --> 01:09:08.160]   All it's always library that...
[01:09:08.160 --> 01:09:10.560]   I haven't seen that in any other demo app.
[01:09:10.560 --> 01:09:11.840]   So I didn't know whether that's...
[01:09:11.840 --> 01:09:14.960]   Remember that ARKit could be combined with other code libraries that people are using
[01:09:14.960 --> 01:09:16.360]   for AR.
[01:09:16.360 --> 01:09:18.680]   And so that's why you really have to ask these questions.
[01:09:18.680 --> 01:09:24.240]   Like Google had AR core that they released or...
[01:09:24.240 --> 01:09:27.160]   Excuse me, released to developers last week.
[01:09:27.160 --> 01:09:29.160]   And again, really wonderful demos.
[01:09:29.160 --> 01:09:32.040]   But one of the things that can't do is it can't place a poster.
[01:09:32.040 --> 01:09:34.200]   It doesn't do vertical surfaces yet.
[01:09:34.200 --> 01:09:35.200]   So you can't do things like...
[01:09:35.200 --> 01:09:40.200]   I wonder if that Che Guevara poster, I see it the soon uni will look at in my dorm room.
[01:09:40.200 --> 01:09:41.880]   You can't put it there.
[01:09:41.880 --> 01:09:44.760]   It'll require someone else's software to do that.
[01:09:44.760 --> 01:09:46.480]   So it's an exciting time.
[01:09:46.480 --> 01:09:48.840]   I'm glad to see that now both platforms are supporting it.
[01:09:48.840 --> 01:09:51.560]   But it's going to be...
[01:09:51.560 --> 01:09:52.560]   It's like...
[01:09:52.560 --> 01:09:56.080]   I wish that there were a nutritional panel on the back of the box where you can say,
[01:09:56.080 --> 01:10:02.360]   "This contains 60% ARKit, 20% some open source project, 30% something that we paid some Russian
[01:10:02.360 --> 01:10:03.360]   guy for."
[01:10:03.360 --> 01:10:04.360]   Yeah.
[01:10:04.360 --> 01:10:05.360]   And it's Gen 1, too.
[01:10:05.360 --> 01:10:08.640]   So I assume that over time we'll get the wall detection and the face detection and the...
[01:10:08.640 --> 01:10:09.640]   Some of these...
[01:10:09.640 --> 01:10:15.800]   I have to say some of these things may not even use ARKit, right?
[01:10:15.800 --> 01:10:21.760]   And Snapchat does a very good job of this exact kind of thing without ARKit's help.
[01:10:21.760 --> 01:10:22.760]   This is...
[01:10:22.760 --> 01:10:26.080]   I think the point of this is to let anyone be Snapchat, not to be too club about it.
[01:10:26.080 --> 01:10:30.400]   But if you're a startup and you can now work on the core technologies that you're good
[01:10:30.400 --> 01:10:35.360]   at and not have to also build out your own AR framework and presentation layer and image
[01:10:35.360 --> 01:10:40.160]   ingestion and all computer vision and all those technologies so that any company can
[01:10:40.160 --> 01:10:42.040]   sort of say, "We have this makeup app.
[01:10:42.040 --> 01:10:45.240]   We don't have to reinvent Snapchat's filter technology.
[01:10:45.240 --> 01:10:49.920]   We can just use ARKit to get us 3,000 light years ahead of where we would have been on
[01:10:49.920 --> 01:10:50.920]   our own."
[01:10:50.920 --> 01:10:51.920]   Right.
[01:10:51.920 --> 01:10:52.920]   Exactly.
[01:10:52.920 --> 01:10:57.080]   Just like the developers of Scrivener could focus on just making a word processor with
[01:10:57.080 --> 01:11:00.280]   just the features that they imagine would be great for word processor.
[01:11:00.280 --> 01:11:02.080]   They don't have to learn how to write a printer driver.
[01:11:02.080 --> 01:11:07.040]   They don't have to learn how to do an internet stack because all this stuff is built into
[01:11:07.040 --> 01:11:08.040]   the operating system.
[01:11:08.040 --> 01:11:09.040]   So this...
[01:11:09.040 --> 01:11:13.320]   This allows a lot of really wonderful mutants to come out of the woodwork.
[01:11:13.320 --> 01:11:19.400]   If you didn't have to write any AR code whatsoever, you just had to come up with an idea for AR.
[01:11:19.400 --> 01:11:23.080]   And essentially, instead of spending two years learning how to write AR code, you could spend
[01:11:23.080 --> 01:11:27.360]   just a couple of weeks or a couple of months learning how to use ARKit, what would you come
[01:11:27.360 --> 01:11:28.360]   up with?
[01:11:28.360 --> 01:11:30.080]   And there's a lot of people that wouldn't...
[01:11:30.080 --> 01:11:35.520]   This idea is just stupid enough to be worth a couple months of my time.
[01:11:35.520 --> 01:11:37.320]   It's not worth two years of my time.
[01:11:37.320 --> 01:11:40.280]   And all those stupid ideas, wonderful ideas come.
[01:11:40.280 --> 01:11:41.720]   I think we talked about this later.
[01:11:41.720 --> 01:11:46.320]   One of the best games on the Vive in the beginning were just single people using the Unreal Engine
[01:11:46.320 --> 01:11:50.000]   built-in stuff to make dungeon crawls and lightsaber battles.
[01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:52.440]   And it's just amazing what they could do with the built-in tools.
[01:11:52.440 --> 01:11:53.440]   Yeah.
[01:11:53.440 --> 01:11:54.760]   Well, and so here's a couple of games.
[01:11:54.760 --> 01:11:56.960]   Here's a Rise from Climax Studio.
[01:11:56.960 --> 01:12:00.480]   This looks a lot like the Minecraft demo.
[01:12:00.480 --> 01:12:03.520]   Microsoft drags out every time they show the HoloLens.
[01:12:03.520 --> 01:12:11.320]   It's a tabletop something building or construction that you can interact with and move around
[01:12:11.320 --> 01:12:12.320]   with.
[01:12:12.320 --> 01:12:16.880]   I have to point out that this just adds one more annoying thing to your gaming.
[01:12:16.880 --> 01:12:18.800]   You have to hold the phone in front of your face.
[01:12:18.800 --> 01:12:23.360]   If Andy's arm got tired holding up that puppet, imagine him having to do this while he's
[01:12:23.360 --> 01:12:24.720]   playing the game the whole time.
[01:12:24.720 --> 01:12:25.720]   I don't...
[01:12:25.720 --> 01:12:28.960]   It wasn't holding up the puppets that you and Renee were talking so fast working the
[01:12:28.960 --> 01:12:29.960]   mouse.
[01:12:29.960 --> 01:12:33.560]   Well, you won't have to work the mouth of ARKit.
[01:12:33.560 --> 01:12:40.040]   And if you're dealing with the iPad Pro, which is clearly one of the ARKit's chief platforms,
[01:12:40.040 --> 01:12:41.040]   it's heavy and big.
[01:12:41.040 --> 01:12:44.320]   Like the Star Wars chess, you had to sit there for the whole Star Wars chess game.
[01:12:44.320 --> 01:12:45.320]   Really?
[01:12:45.320 --> 01:12:46.320]   Are you going to...
[01:12:46.320 --> 01:12:47.320]   I mean, I guess you could put it on a...
[01:12:47.320 --> 01:12:51.280]   The Be a Hulk market for arms to hold these, right?
[01:12:51.280 --> 01:12:55.360]   It's also, I mean, when they first put out Pokemon Gold, they made a big deal showing
[01:12:55.360 --> 01:12:56.360]   off the AR mode.
[01:12:56.360 --> 01:12:57.360]   I don't know anybody who actually plays with the AR.
[01:12:57.360 --> 01:12:58.360]   No, we all turn it off.
[01:12:58.360 --> 01:12:59.360]   It's just a great demo.
[01:12:59.360 --> 01:13:00.360]   Yeah.
[01:13:00.360 --> 01:13:01.360]   And this is the same thing.
[01:13:01.360 --> 01:13:02.360]   Like some of these will be real games.
[01:13:02.360 --> 01:13:05.440]   Others will just be proof of concepts and eventually we'll find stuff like...
[01:13:05.440 --> 01:13:08.520]   Like we talk about education, training.
[01:13:08.520 --> 01:13:13.480]   I'm not a twit, but Leo needs to at least tell me how to restart the Tri-Caster and he can
[01:13:13.480 --> 01:13:15.480]   be there in AR pointing at the bottom.
[01:13:15.480 --> 01:13:18.280]   I've always thought that could be a really big thing.
[01:13:18.280 --> 01:13:20.760]   And that's another thing a Microsoft demonstrate with HoloLens.
[01:13:20.760 --> 01:13:24.840]   You know, how to fix a pipe and you're actually under your sink and you've got a plumber
[01:13:24.840 --> 01:13:25.840]   showing me.
[01:13:25.840 --> 01:13:26.840]   I am Groot.
[01:13:26.840 --> 01:13:27.840]   No, I am Groot.
[01:13:27.840 --> 01:13:28.840]   Yes.
[01:13:28.840 --> 01:13:29.840]   Or...
[01:13:29.840 --> 01:13:31.560]   I finally know what that reference is.
[01:13:31.560 --> 01:13:33.760]   I finally saw the movie after all these rights.
[01:13:33.760 --> 01:13:34.760]   Yeah.
[01:13:34.760 --> 01:13:36.760]   Or how popular you all...
[01:13:36.760 --> 01:13:41.120]   Or how Google is dealing with a glass for enterprise.
[01:13:41.120 --> 01:13:43.800]   Where as something that people are going to buy and put on their face and walk around
[01:13:43.800 --> 01:13:45.120]   with all day, no.
[01:13:45.120 --> 01:13:49.880]   But as something that a company is going to buy and then contract special software for,
[01:13:49.880 --> 01:13:53.520]   so that specifically these people on their work in their warehouse or in their production
[01:13:53.520 --> 01:13:55.840]   line will get value from it.
[01:13:55.840 --> 01:13:56.840]   Yes.
[01:13:56.840 --> 01:14:02.040]   So I think that a lot of the most interesting AR stuff will be not specific apps, but a
[01:14:02.040 --> 01:14:04.680]   feature that gets added to Apple Maps for instance.
[01:14:04.680 --> 01:14:10.760]   Or a feature that gets added to Facebook or a feature that gets added to this GPS app.
[01:14:10.760 --> 01:14:12.720]   Because it's kind of sad.
[01:14:12.720 --> 01:14:20.720]   I mean, as cool as the AR feature of Pokemon Go is, like Renee said, you stop using it
[01:14:20.720 --> 01:14:21.960]   after because it seems like a gimmick.
[01:14:21.960 --> 01:14:24.720]   You want to use the something that's a little bit more direct and more efficient.
[01:14:24.720 --> 01:14:28.960]   So that will be kind of a fail if it becomes a really cool demo or something that you will
[01:14:28.960 --> 01:14:34.280]   download this fun FART app, the AR version of a FART app or a flashlight app.
[01:14:34.280 --> 01:14:40.080]   Stay with it for about two days and then forget that it's there until you get to page 14
[01:14:40.080 --> 01:14:43.160]   of your app launcher and start to delete it.
[01:14:43.160 --> 01:14:47.240]   It needs to be something that people just understand just like multi-touch is part of
[01:14:47.240 --> 01:14:48.240]   the experience.
[01:14:48.240 --> 01:14:49.680]   So that's what's going to happen about a year or so.
[01:14:49.680 --> 01:14:54.360]   I do think that kids particularly, and we talked at the beginning about Matthew Panzerino,
[01:14:54.360 --> 01:14:55.360]   is that his daughter?
[01:14:55.360 --> 01:14:57.160]   I don't know if that's them.
[01:14:57.160 --> 01:14:58.160]   Matthew wrote the article.
[01:14:58.160 --> 01:14:59.160]   I don't know if that's actually them.
[01:14:59.160 --> 01:15:01.200]   It's some kid he found.
[01:15:01.200 --> 01:15:04.920]   But the kid was playing, I didn't know this, but now I realize the very hungry caterpillar,
[01:15:04.920 --> 01:15:10.720]   which is a book my children adored and putting that caterpillar in a kid's space, a young
[01:15:10.720 --> 01:15:14.920]   child, you know, three, four, five year old, putting it in their space.
[01:15:14.920 --> 01:15:19.720]   That's Eric Carl, the illustrator, drawing the very hungry caterpillar.
[01:15:19.720 --> 01:15:24.400]   But putting it in the space, giving the book more life, I think that's a kid I could see
[01:15:24.400 --> 01:15:28.920]   being, there you go, is totally excited about doing that.
[01:15:28.920 --> 01:15:31.160]   So that's another market that the children's books.
[01:15:31.160 --> 01:15:37.280]   Children's, I don't know, learning games, educational games, things like that.
[01:15:37.280 --> 01:15:42.160]   I don't want to scare anybody, but given as maybe there should be an age limit for this
[01:15:42.160 --> 01:15:49.000]   sort of thing, because there's an age at which you finally, a child finally gets object
[01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:50.000]   permanence.
[01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:54.040]   The idea that if I turn away, if I put the teddy bear on the ground, then turn away from
[01:15:54.040 --> 01:15:56.880]   it, then turn back, the teddy bear will still be there.
[01:15:56.880 --> 01:16:01.440]   If they spend a lot of time with these games expecting that, there's expecting that, well,
[01:16:01.440 --> 01:16:04.800]   I put my glass of milk down here on this table, it might not be there.
[01:16:04.800 --> 01:16:09.280]   I might have to pick up a phone to see if that glass of milk is still there.
[01:16:09.280 --> 01:16:14.120]   It's, isn't it wonderful how we are technology.
[01:16:14.120 --> 01:16:21.000]   Have this ongoing, you know, scientific experiments on children and on our society without having
[01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:24.120]   to get anybody's approval or anybody's thought about whether it's a good idea.
[01:16:24.120 --> 01:16:27.820]   On the other hand, do you really want FDA approval on augmented reality?
[01:16:27.820 --> 01:16:29.220]   Oh, no, I'm not.
[01:16:29.220 --> 01:16:31.400]   We're all in a simulation anyway.
[01:16:31.400 --> 01:16:33.080]   I'm not talking about.
[01:16:33.080 --> 01:16:37.280]   We're playing, we're shooting craps with our psyches all the time, Andy.
[01:16:37.280 --> 01:16:40.520]   Come on, that's, that's, that's the nature of on this spaceship.
[01:16:40.520 --> 01:16:44.360]   Yeah, this revolution we're going through talking about being scared.
[01:16:44.360 --> 01:16:46.000]   Here's a scary one, the walking dead.
[01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:48.480]   You want zombies in your world?
[01:16:48.480 --> 01:16:49.480]   Thank you.
[01:16:49.480 --> 01:16:52.920]   It's a working on a new location based AR game set in the world.
[01:16:52.920 --> 01:16:54.560]   So this would be like Pokemon go.
[01:16:54.560 --> 01:16:56.120]   It's not Niantic though.
[01:16:56.120 --> 01:16:58.240]   But they want to eat your brain.
[01:16:58.240 --> 01:17:02.840]   So expect to see a lot of people like this doofus wandering in the park.
[01:17:02.840 --> 01:17:06.760]   Rumors are going to do Harry Potter fantastic beasts as well.
[01:17:06.760 --> 01:17:08.240]   Niantic is.
[01:17:08.240 --> 01:17:10.720]   Maybe Niantic, maybe someone else, but that's a franchise that's been rumored for a while.
[01:17:10.720 --> 01:17:14.320]   Yeah, yeah, Niantic has been, I'd heard that several times about Niantic that they were
[01:17:14.320 --> 01:17:18.960]   going to basically take Pokemon go and turn it into a Harry Potter game, which they should
[01:17:18.960 --> 01:17:19.960]   be awesome.
[01:17:19.960 --> 01:17:20.960]   I'd play that.
[01:17:20.960 --> 01:17:24.280]   I guess if you're a walking dead fan or you just like fighting zombies in the park, but
[01:17:24.280 --> 01:17:26.880]   I just feel like this is a risky proposition.
[01:17:26.880 --> 01:17:32.920]   Well, he's going to hit the guy behind this guy.
[01:17:32.920 --> 01:17:38.880]   I guess, you know, it's one way to get exercise.
[01:17:38.880 --> 01:17:39.880]   Look out.
[01:17:39.880 --> 01:17:42.600]   There's this, you know, but this is the other thing to point out is that these games are
[01:17:42.600 --> 01:17:46.160]   always kind of constrained, not really that interesting.
[01:17:46.160 --> 01:17:49.560]   That's actually true of VR games in general because movement is difficult.
[01:17:49.560 --> 01:17:51.320]   Yeah, yeah, I don't know.
[01:17:51.320 --> 01:17:55.280]   Also, most also in that grasp, people are seen be floating about eight to ten inches of
[01:17:55.280 --> 01:17:56.280]   the ground.
[01:17:56.280 --> 01:17:57.280]   So it's not perfect.
[01:17:57.280 --> 01:18:01.240]   But like I said, are you going to be one of those AR kit picky pickies?
[01:18:01.240 --> 01:18:04.720]   No, no, I'm just, I'm just, I don't know.
[01:18:04.720 --> 01:18:08.480]   It doesn't look like the floor matching is really working.
[01:18:08.480 --> 01:18:09.920]   But that, but that could be a problem.
[01:18:09.920 --> 01:18:14.320]   If it's not zombies that you're killing, if it's, I'm expecting that if you're telling
[01:18:14.320 --> 01:18:20.360]   me that this eight foot by 12 foot, rug is going to fit in this, in this room, you know,
[01:18:20.360 --> 01:18:21.360]   better fit.
[01:18:21.360 --> 01:18:22.360]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:18:22.360 --> 01:18:23.720]   And then I touch a button in the app.
[01:18:23.720 --> 01:18:24.720]   So great.
[01:18:24.720 --> 01:18:25.720]   And on that basis, I will order it.
[01:18:25.720 --> 01:18:27.720]   And then turns out that it doesn't fit at all.
[01:18:27.720 --> 01:18:28.720]   That's okay.
[01:18:28.720 --> 01:18:32.200]   I'm just saying the, remember that as great as these demos are these, this is very much
[01:18:32.200 --> 01:18:37.360]   1.0 that we're going to have to wait several months, if not a year or so before we get
[01:18:37.360 --> 01:18:39.040]   the really good stuff going.
[01:18:39.040 --> 01:18:44.040]   And so don't be, don't, don't be turned off if the first experience is not a great experience.
[01:18:44.040 --> 01:18:45.040]   Again, good.
[01:18:45.040 --> 01:18:49.000]   You don't have to keep using every single day, but come on back in a few months to see how
[01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:50.080]   things have improved.
[01:18:50.080 --> 01:18:51.720]   What's this one?
[01:18:51.720 --> 01:18:57.360]   Pixie Tracker uses Apple's ARKit to guide you toward lost items in augmented reality.
[01:18:57.360 --> 01:19:01.800]   Ah, that'd be kind of cool if you had a Bluetooth tracking device.
[01:19:01.800 --> 01:19:04.280]   You could look at your, why that be cool?
[01:19:04.280 --> 01:19:05.680]   I wonder how that would work though.
[01:19:05.680 --> 01:19:11.000]   I know like our sponsor, the tracker isn't, you know, because it's Bluetooth doesn't
[01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:16.360]   really know, you know, like it would be great if you could say, where are my keys and you
[01:19:16.360 --> 01:19:19.880]   would look around your room and you see the keys in your sofa.
[01:19:19.880 --> 01:19:24.320]   But I don't think that information anyway exists in the, this would have to be a new,
[01:19:24.320 --> 01:19:30.680]   a new kind of hardware tracking device that I'm not sure exactly how it would work.
[01:19:30.680 --> 01:19:36.600]   I mean, if that, how would, how would the, I presume the Pixie is much like tile or, or
[01:19:36.600 --> 01:19:37.960]   the tracker sponsor.
[01:19:37.960 --> 01:19:43.240]   I don't understand how it would know how it would have that information.
[01:19:43.240 --> 01:19:46.000]   Bluetooth isn't going to tell it where it is.
[01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:47.000]   Hmm.
[01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:48.000]   Right.
[01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:49.000]   And the map isn't that accurate.
[01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:50.480]   It's a, it's a great idea to use it.
[01:19:50.480 --> 01:19:51.480]   Maybe it's using beacon technology.
[01:19:51.480 --> 01:19:53.440]   If I have to do something like, oh, maybe it is.
[01:19:53.440 --> 01:19:54.440]   That would be interesting.
[01:19:54.440 --> 01:19:56.080]   Could beacon give you directionality?
[01:19:56.080 --> 01:19:57.640]   Can you do know where a beacon is?
[01:19:57.640 --> 01:19:58.640]   Exactly.
[01:19:58.640 --> 01:19:59.640]   I believe so.
[01:19:59.640 --> 01:20:00.640]   That's why they use the mister.
[01:20:00.640 --> 01:20:01.640]   Let's tell you the location.
[01:20:01.640 --> 01:20:02.640]   Yeah.
[01:20:02.640 --> 01:20:07.320]   Remember, look at that in the earlier in that demo, you had the spin around.
[01:20:07.320 --> 01:20:08.320]   Right.
[01:20:08.320 --> 01:20:09.320]   Until you get this.
[01:20:09.320 --> 01:20:10.320]   So it is beak.
[01:20:10.320 --> 01:20:11.320]   Maybe it is using beaconing.
[01:20:11.320 --> 01:20:12.320]   That's it.
[01:20:12.320 --> 01:20:13.320]   That would be an interesting idea.
[01:20:13.320 --> 01:20:14.320]   Yeah.
[01:20:14.320 --> 01:20:15.320]   Look at that.
[01:20:15.320 --> 01:20:20.400]   So it's showing you your keys in an superimposed on the screen.
[01:20:20.400 --> 01:20:21.400]   And there they are.
[01:20:21.400 --> 01:20:22.400]   Look at that.
[01:20:22.400 --> 01:20:23.400]   Tada.
[01:20:23.400 --> 01:20:24.400]   Tada.
[01:20:24.400 --> 01:20:25.400]   Look at this.
[01:20:25.400 --> 01:20:26.400]   Oh, okay.
[01:20:26.400 --> 01:20:27.400]   Did you see the size of the dongle?
[01:20:27.400 --> 01:20:28.400]   Okay.
[01:20:28.400 --> 01:20:29.400]   I get it now.
[01:20:29.400 --> 01:20:30.400]   It's this big.
[01:20:30.400 --> 01:20:32.040]   Maybe there is beaconing in there.
[01:20:32.040 --> 01:20:33.040]   Yeah.
[01:20:33.040 --> 01:20:34.040]   Yeah.
[01:20:34.040 --> 01:20:36.440]   How would you, you couldn't really triangulate Bluetooth?
[01:20:36.440 --> 01:20:39.240]   You could say it's getting stronger.
[01:20:39.240 --> 01:20:41.680]   I guess you could do that, right?
[01:20:41.680 --> 01:20:44.080]   If you're turning a colder mister--
[01:20:44.080 --> 01:20:46.080]   From a stator, warmer, warmer, warmer.
[01:20:46.080 --> 01:20:47.080]   You could do that.
[01:20:47.080 --> 01:20:49.960]   From a static position, it couldn't get that kind of location.
[01:20:49.960 --> 01:20:55.640]   If again, it tells you turn around 360 degrees, it could certainly find out that the signal
[01:20:55.640 --> 01:20:58.160]   seems to be stronger from this place.
[01:20:58.160 --> 01:21:03.000]   Although that's iffy as well, because you don't know what kind of surfaces the signal
[01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:04.000]   is bouncing off of.
[01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:05.280]   So it's interesting.
[01:21:05.280 --> 01:21:10.080]   There's going to be a lot of people that are going to have to really craft their demos
[01:21:10.080 --> 01:21:11.520]   very, very well.
[01:21:11.520 --> 01:21:14.560]   A developer can do a demo and then release it on YouTube.
[01:21:14.560 --> 01:21:19.760]   A company has to do a demo and then release it to lawyers who then have to say, "Okay,
[01:21:19.760 --> 01:21:25.400]   show me every piece of B-roll, every second of footers that were shot before this because
[01:21:25.400 --> 01:21:29.720]   we might need to have more information given to people before they think that this is going
[01:21:29.720 --> 01:21:30.720]   to work."
[01:21:30.720 --> 01:21:31.720]   Yeah.
[01:21:31.720 --> 01:21:34.960]   I'm looking at the website, getpixie.com.
[01:21:34.960 --> 01:21:37.400]   It looks like it's just a standard Bluetooth tracker.
[01:21:37.400 --> 01:21:43.880]   But it is large, so I'm wondering if it can do more than that.
[01:21:43.880 --> 01:21:45.840]   Okay.
[01:21:45.840 --> 01:21:51.720]   I can guarantee you that if this is doable, the other guys will be doing it too.
[01:21:51.720 --> 01:21:52.720]   That's cool.
[01:21:52.720 --> 01:21:53.720]   We'll watch with interest.
[01:21:53.720 --> 01:21:55.520]   The propagation of technology.
[01:21:55.520 --> 01:21:56.520]   Watch with interest.
[01:21:56.520 --> 01:21:57.520]   Anything.
[01:21:57.520 --> 01:21:59.720]   The best stuff is going to be stuff that we can't think about.
[01:21:59.720 --> 01:22:00.720]   That's what I think.
[01:22:00.720 --> 01:22:07.760]   It's the mutant developers that are going to really push this full.
[01:22:07.760 --> 01:22:08.760]   Anything else we should talk about?
[01:22:08.760 --> 01:22:09.760]   I mean, here we are.
[01:22:09.760 --> 01:22:13.240]   This is it, the last show before the big reveal.
[01:22:13.240 --> 01:22:22.480]   Andy, share with us your hopes and dreams for what Apple will be telling us next week.
[01:22:22.480 --> 01:22:26.960]   I hope they're going to be telling us that boy, did we screw up with that MacBook Pro?
[01:22:26.960 --> 01:22:29.760]   We promise that we're going to refund everybody's money and we're going to create a brand new
[01:22:29.760 --> 01:22:32.800]   MacBook Pro with a decent keyboard.
[01:22:32.800 --> 01:22:37.720]   Also, we're going to really, really invest in the Mac Mini.
[01:22:37.720 --> 01:22:39.560]   As a matter of fact, we're making it more powerful.
[01:22:39.560 --> 01:22:43.320]   We're going to make sure the price point is under $500 because we think that that's a
[01:22:43.320 --> 01:22:44.320]   really important product.
[01:22:44.320 --> 01:22:48.520]   We're not just going to say that we're actually going to back that up by saying we want lots
[01:22:48.520 --> 01:22:50.120]   and lots of people to buy them.
[01:22:50.120 --> 01:22:57.120]   I hope that there is a bobblehead of some sort given away from some minor Mac celebrity
[01:22:57.120 --> 01:22:58.120]   from the executive board.
[01:22:58.120 --> 01:23:02.120]   Someone who's still there, that big and basic kind of button that you push at the base that
[01:23:02.120 --> 01:23:05.200]   says something wise and something interesting.
[01:23:05.200 --> 01:23:11.200]   I do actually, I know you're being a little facetious, but I would love to see Apple say
[01:23:11.200 --> 01:23:16.840]   yet on Saturday in the new screensavers, you're talking to a caller, Mandy the Clown,
[01:23:16.840 --> 01:23:25.760]   who got from her place of employ an old cheese grater Mac Pro, the old Mac Pro's.
[01:23:25.760 --> 01:23:32.800]   We brought mine out and just remind me how beautifully engineered and expandable.
[01:23:32.800 --> 01:23:37.640]   I've said this many times, but I would love to see whatever this next Mac Pro is.
[01:23:37.640 --> 01:23:41.120]   Apple acknowledged, they already acknowledged that they made a mistake with the trash can
[01:23:41.120 --> 01:23:48.760]   Mac, but really go back to that expandability workhorse tool that would warm the cockles
[01:23:48.760 --> 01:23:49.760]   of my heart.
[01:23:49.760 --> 01:23:52.000]   It would make me feel like they still care about them.
[01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:54.000]   I think they'll be happy.
[01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:56.000]   Do you know something?
[01:23:56.000 --> 01:24:00.560]   Well, I mean, the iMac Pro addresses one part of the segment of their audience.
[01:24:00.560 --> 01:24:01.560]   But it's not expanding.
[01:24:01.560 --> 01:24:02.560]   I want to expand.
[01:24:02.560 --> 01:24:03.560]   No.
[01:24:03.560 --> 01:24:07.360]   So that's why they meet a culprit and are working on a more modular Mac with exactly sort of
[01:24:07.360 --> 01:24:09.240]   that type of consumer and pro in mind.
[01:24:09.240 --> 01:24:10.240]   That would be awesome.
[01:24:10.240 --> 01:24:14.760]   They don't have to do something cool and Johnny Ivish.
[01:24:14.760 --> 01:24:17.520]   The cheese grater was just fine, thank you.
[01:24:17.520 --> 01:24:18.520]   It was brilliant, though.
[01:24:18.520 --> 01:24:22.240]   I used to have tower PCs that were like you were forever fuddling with a screwdriver
[01:24:22.240 --> 01:24:24.000]   and removing things and cables.
[01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:25.160]   And these were amazing.
[01:24:25.160 --> 01:24:28.560]   You'd pull it out, you'd put a drive in, you'd pull it out, you'd screw the CPU around,
[01:24:28.560 --> 01:24:29.560]   you'd pull it out, you'd add it around.
[01:24:29.560 --> 01:24:30.560]   It was amazing.
[01:24:30.560 --> 01:24:33.680]   It was all on drawers, it was all toolless design.
[01:24:33.680 --> 01:24:37.160]   The aluminum was thick, heavy gauge.
[01:24:37.160 --> 01:24:39.760]   It was heavy as hell.
[01:24:39.760 --> 01:24:40.760]   But who cares?
[01:24:40.760 --> 01:24:44.600]   You're not going to carry this thing to your birthday party.
[01:24:44.600 --> 01:24:46.800]   This is for under the desk.
[01:24:46.800 --> 01:24:47.800]   Oh, really?
[01:24:47.800 --> 01:24:49.480]   They could just, you know what?
[01:24:49.480 --> 01:24:53.120]   You want Apple, you want to make everybody happy?
[01:24:53.120 --> 01:24:55.880]   Just say, you know, we think we'll make another cheese grater.
[01:24:55.880 --> 01:25:02.560]   But this time, we'll have the latest Xeon CPUs, we'll have KB Lake, Zions, we'll have the
[01:25:02.560 --> 01:25:11.080]   latest, you know, 1080i, TII and DDR5 memory up to 128 gigabytes or just like really blow
[01:25:11.080 --> 01:25:12.080]   us away.
[01:25:12.080 --> 01:25:13.080]   Yeah.
[01:25:13.080 --> 01:25:18.880]   I won't be disappointed if they don't mention Mac this event because it's just going to
[01:25:18.880 --> 01:25:22.280]   be too full of stuff for them to distract with anything they're not shipping.
[01:25:22.280 --> 01:25:25.760]   But I do every single statement that Apple makes, the thing that I'm hoping for most of
[01:25:25.760 --> 01:25:29.160]   all in all seriousness, is something that will convince me that they really are serious
[01:25:29.160 --> 01:25:33.400]   about the Mac and they really do love the Mac and they're not just simply keeping it
[01:25:33.400 --> 01:25:35.840]   going until they run the clock down.
[01:25:35.840 --> 01:25:37.440]   I'm looking for signs to that.
[01:25:37.440 --> 01:25:39.040]   And somebody's saying in the chat about what price?
[01:25:39.040 --> 01:25:43.320]   The price is not an object for people, for tools like this, they're professional tools.
[01:25:43.320 --> 01:25:46.320]   We already kind of stipulated that with the next generation iPhone.
[01:25:46.320 --> 01:25:51.360]   iPhone Pro should be the price should not be a factor in your design.
[01:25:51.360 --> 01:25:53.120]   You should design the best phone you can make.
[01:25:53.120 --> 01:25:54.560]   You're building it for Alex Lindsey.
[01:25:54.560 --> 01:25:55.560]   You're building it for Alex Lindsey.
[01:25:55.560 --> 01:25:58.400]   And the same thing for the look how expensive these things are.
[01:25:58.400 --> 01:25:59.400]   Doesn't matter.
[01:25:59.400 --> 01:26:05.240]   This is a tool for a business that is investing in tools and wants something that will work
[01:26:05.240 --> 01:26:06.240]   for them.
[01:26:06.240 --> 01:26:09.320]   Where time is more valuable than money and the more time they can save and the more power
[01:26:09.320 --> 01:26:11.320]   they have, the better for them.
[01:26:11.320 --> 01:26:13.040]   So that's what I'm hoping for.
[01:26:13.040 --> 01:26:15.000]   What are you hoping for Renee Richie tomorrow?
[01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:16.800]   I understand today's event.
[01:26:16.800 --> 01:26:20.320]   I really want to see how they solve problems because a lot of the stuff is super interesting.
[01:26:20.320 --> 01:26:24.800]   Like when you look at just like you hear OLED display, but how are they going to implement
[01:26:24.800 --> 01:26:29.680]   3D touch on an OLED display because there's no LED to do the distance measurement anymore.
[01:26:29.680 --> 01:26:32.200]   If there is no touch ID, how are they going to implement face ID?
[01:26:32.200 --> 01:26:36.760]   Like I know technically it'll all sit on top of the same framework, but just the UI stuff.
[01:26:36.760 --> 01:26:40.480]   Like do I look at it and then hold it towards NFC thing?
[01:26:40.480 --> 01:26:41.480]   What from what angle?
[01:26:41.480 --> 01:26:44.760]   What's the security benefits or detriment is going to be?
[01:26:44.760 --> 01:26:47.440]   With the new without the home button, how are they going to handle the gestures?
[01:26:47.440 --> 01:26:50.920]   Because there's only a few gross gestures that are easy to do.
[01:26:50.920 --> 01:26:53.960]   Everything else becomes these arcane gesture magic tricks.
[01:26:53.960 --> 01:26:57.680]   And we saw like with things like the Blackberry Hub on BB10 that people, they don't remember
[01:26:57.680 --> 01:26:59.680]   how to use them if they get too complicated.
[01:26:59.680 --> 01:27:03.480]   So how do they pack sort of, I think Palm pre, like Andy's example, was a really good
[01:27:03.480 --> 01:27:04.480]   one.
[01:27:04.480 --> 01:27:06.440]   How do they sort of handle those metaphors?
[01:27:06.440 --> 01:27:08.080]   With the ears on the top, do they blend them in?
[01:27:08.080 --> 01:27:09.280]   Do they not blend them in?
[01:27:09.280 --> 01:27:13.320]   It's all like the implementation details is what I'm super curious about.
[01:27:13.320 --> 01:27:17.800]   And if they can make really smart choices and they can really make like a face ID, for example,
[01:27:17.800 --> 01:27:21.400]   is not just a compromise because touch ID doesn't work in this package, but is a step
[01:27:21.400 --> 01:27:25.520]   forward and the new way of accessing the multi touch app launcher from swiping up is not
[01:27:25.520 --> 01:27:29.640]   just replacing the 3D touch gesture to get there, but it's actually an improvement.
[01:27:29.640 --> 01:27:34.480]   It makes the experience better and all those sort of things what I'm looking forward to.
[01:27:34.480 --> 01:27:35.480]   Al, amen.
[01:27:35.480 --> 01:27:36.480]   Al, Luyi.
[01:27:36.480 --> 01:27:42.680]   And do you get so you feel like at these talks, you do get a better understanding of Apple's
[01:27:42.680 --> 01:27:48.640]   goals and why they do what they did and that they give you that kind of information.
[01:27:48.640 --> 01:27:50.280]   You get to hear their take on it.
[01:27:50.280 --> 01:27:54.920]   Whether I ultimately agree or disagree with their take, I get to hear sort of, and it's
[01:27:54.920 --> 01:27:55.920]   not the rank.
[01:27:55.920 --> 01:27:57.600]   It's not the actual information.
[01:27:57.600 --> 01:27:58.600]   It's what they're marketing department.
[01:27:58.600 --> 01:27:59.600]   Well, that's what it's about.
[01:27:59.600 --> 01:28:01.680]   It's more the spin on it.
[01:28:01.680 --> 01:28:02.680]   Right.
[01:28:02.680 --> 01:28:03.680]   Why?
[01:28:03.680 --> 01:28:04.680]   But I want to hear that.
[01:28:04.680 --> 01:28:05.680]   So I can just to pull like I have my assumptions.
[01:28:05.680 --> 01:28:09.320]   I'm going to go in and I try hard not to have pre, you know, pre assumptions, but I have
[01:28:09.320 --> 01:28:10.320]   them.
[01:28:10.320 --> 01:28:11.320]   I'm human.
[01:28:11.320 --> 01:28:15.240]   Briefing is after the fact that might give you more of that kind of information.
[01:28:15.240 --> 01:28:18.880]   Sometimes yeah, sometimes it's later, sometimes it's on the phone or follows up, but I like
[01:28:18.880 --> 01:28:22.880]   to hear where they're coming from because then like if they say we're inventing a screwdriver
[01:28:22.880 --> 01:28:26.680]   and some publication goes, Apple or idiots, this is the worst hammer ever.
[01:28:26.680 --> 01:28:29.040]   That's not really a fair take because they said they're making a screwdriver.
[01:28:29.040 --> 01:28:32.360]   I want to hear what they say is like and sort of measure what they've given me compared
[01:28:32.360 --> 01:28:34.880]   to what they were what they were trying to give me.
[01:28:34.880 --> 01:28:35.880]   Yeah.
[01:28:35.880 --> 01:28:36.880]   Yeah.
[01:28:36.880 --> 01:28:37.880]   Well, we'll see.
[01:28:37.880 --> 01:28:38.880]   I would love to see some talk about the Mac.
[01:28:38.880 --> 01:28:41.600]   I would love to see a phone.
[01:28:41.600 --> 01:28:45.920]   I think we're going to get the another iPhone that's going to blow people away.
[01:28:45.920 --> 01:28:46.920]   I'm hoping so.
[01:28:46.920 --> 01:28:51.280]   I'm hoping it's not just an iterative, you know, improvement on the existing iPhones.
[01:28:51.280 --> 01:28:55.280]   I home pod, finally a 4K Apple TV.
[01:28:55.280 --> 01:28:57.080]   We will be covering that event.
[01:28:57.080 --> 01:28:59.440]   As I said, Tuesday 10 AM Pacific.
[01:28:59.440 --> 01:29:01.840]   I hope you tune in live when join us in the chatroom.
[01:29:01.840 --> 01:29:03.400]   We can do the back chat.
[01:29:03.400 --> 01:29:08.840]   It'll be Alex Lindsey, Megan Maroney and me and you can watch it live at live.com.
[01:29:08.840 --> 01:29:12.280]   Or Twitter.tv/live.
[01:29:12.280 --> 01:29:15.440]   Also announced, I'm not sure why they preannounced it so far ahead.
[01:29:15.440 --> 01:29:21.240]   Coming this fall, well, I guess fall is here almost, Pixelmator Pro, the folks at Pixelmator
[01:29:21.240 --> 01:29:26.720]   who really do, I think, increasingly make one of the best image editing programs for
[01:29:26.720 --> 01:29:31.280]   the Mac have said that they are going to release a brand new version of Pixelmator Pro version
[01:29:31.280 --> 01:29:35.880]   that will have non-destructive editing have many of the things people who do who use Lightroom
[01:29:35.880 --> 01:29:40.720]   and Photoshop are looking for.
[01:29:40.720 --> 01:29:45.040]   I'm a big fan of Pixelmator, both on the iPad and on the Macintosh.
[01:29:45.040 --> 01:29:47.920]   I'm very interested to see what they come up with.
[01:29:47.920 --> 01:29:50.200]   They clearly have a big investment.
[01:29:50.200 --> 01:29:53.120]   It's good to see somebody give Adobe a run for their money.
[01:29:53.120 --> 01:29:54.800]   Adobe's own this market for so long.
[01:29:54.800 --> 01:29:55.800]   Oh, look at that.
[01:29:55.800 --> 01:29:59.200]   And Mac native, which is the biggest selling point of Pixelmator.
[01:29:59.200 --> 01:30:01.440]   As opposed to Adobe, which is not?
[01:30:01.440 --> 01:30:03.000]   Sort of doing their own thing.
[01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:05.640]   Well, Adobe, for years, they had a different code base.
[01:30:05.640 --> 01:30:07.360]   Then they were using Flash for their interface.
[01:30:07.360 --> 01:30:09.840]   And now still they don't really have a Mac native interface.
[01:30:09.840 --> 01:30:11.480]   They want people to see Photoshop.
[01:30:11.480 --> 01:30:13.320]   They don't necessarily see a Mac app.
[01:30:13.320 --> 01:30:17.200]   And Pixelmator leverages all of Apple's core frameworks and core technologies and
[01:30:17.200 --> 01:30:19.400]   is much more power efficient.
[01:30:19.400 --> 01:30:22.160]   And it is a Mac app in every sense of the word.
[01:30:22.160 --> 01:30:23.160]   Good.
[01:30:23.160 --> 01:30:24.160]   I can't wait.
[01:30:24.160 --> 01:30:25.880]   That'll be very exciting.
[01:30:25.880 --> 01:30:28.040]   So they just announced this.
[01:30:28.040 --> 01:30:31.680]   And if you want to know more, you can go to their website, pixelmator.com/
[01:30:31.680 --> 01:30:33.160]   They're super smart people.
[01:30:33.160 --> 01:30:34.160]   Pro.
[01:30:34.160 --> 01:30:37.080]   I don't know if they're friends.
[01:30:37.080 --> 01:30:38.080]   They're European.
[01:30:38.080 --> 01:30:39.080]   French Canadian.
[01:30:39.080 --> 01:30:40.960]   No, I forget where they're from.
[01:30:40.960 --> 01:30:41.960]   Yeah.
[01:30:41.960 --> 01:30:42.960]   They're probably from--
[01:30:42.960 --> 01:30:43.960]   Aren't they brothers?
[01:30:43.960 --> 01:30:44.960]   I think they're brothers.
[01:30:44.960 --> 01:30:45.960]   Are they?
[01:30:45.960 --> 01:30:47.360]   Just like the Noel brothers.
[01:30:47.360 --> 01:30:48.360]   Right?
[01:30:48.360 --> 01:30:50.680]   Yeah, see it says he's used metal too.
[01:30:50.680 --> 01:30:54.840]   It forced touch, 64-bit architecture.
[01:30:54.840 --> 01:30:59.760]   Heave, auto support heave, the new high efficiency image format.
[01:30:59.760 --> 01:31:00.760]   That's very good news.
[01:31:00.760 --> 01:31:04.120]   This may be the photo editing program of J.R.
[01:31:04.120 --> 01:31:08.480]   Choice, if I were Adobe, I'd be shivering in my boots.
[01:31:08.480 --> 01:31:09.480]   Yeah.
[01:31:09.480 --> 01:31:12.800]   Let's not forget that there are also lots of people that they much rather just buy the
[01:31:12.800 --> 01:31:16.920]   app and own it rather than take the subscription on the--
[01:31:16.920 --> 01:31:23.680]   If you use a lot of different devices and a lot of different apps and you're heavy duty
[01:31:23.680 --> 01:31:29.840]   user Photoshop stuff, then that is $10 a month for the photo package is a good deal.
[01:31:29.840 --> 01:31:34.000]   But there are a lot of people for whom I don't really need to spend $10 a month forever
[01:31:34.000 --> 01:31:37.600]   and it's not important to me that I also get the Windows version of this.
[01:31:37.600 --> 01:31:39.400]   It's not important to me that--
[01:31:39.400 --> 01:31:42.120]   So you can just buy what you want and it'll save you money in the long way.
[01:31:42.120 --> 01:31:44.480]   Actually, Adobe has caused a bit of a storm.
[01:31:44.480 --> 01:31:52.920]   They've done a beta of Lightroom that they're dubbing Lightroom Classic, which implies this
[01:31:52.920 --> 01:31:57.400]   might be the last standalone Lightroom that you may only be able to get it through Creative
[01:31:57.400 --> 01:31:58.400]   Cloud.
[01:31:58.400 --> 01:32:03.640]   I'm not sure, but Adobe forums are going crazy with this beta.
[01:32:03.640 --> 01:32:04.640]   So--
[01:32:04.640 --> 01:32:05.640]   Alio, real time follow up.
[01:32:05.640 --> 01:32:11.760]   Lithuanian brothers, Salud and Adias Dalid, Dalid, or Dalid, or Dalid?
[01:32:11.760 --> 01:32:15.560]   I talked to a good friend who is either an iOS developer.
[01:32:15.560 --> 01:32:21.320]   He has a number of apps on iOS like many, like five that are different versions of the
[01:32:21.320 --> 01:32:27.840]   same kind of core app and was informed by Apple, you can only have one.
[01:32:27.840 --> 01:32:32.400]   Pick the one you want and he was a little upset with the heavy handed way Apple kind
[01:32:32.400 --> 01:32:35.120]   of said, "We're going to give you 90 days to fix this.
[01:32:35.120 --> 01:32:37.120]   Otherwise, we're going to pull those apps from the app store."
[01:32:37.120 --> 01:32:38.560]   I can understand Apple's point of view.
[01:32:38.560 --> 01:32:43.720]   They want to clean up the app store from repetitive apps.
[01:32:43.720 --> 01:32:48.080]   You see a lot of apps that do slightly different things.
[01:32:48.080 --> 01:32:49.080]   Wrapper apps.
[01:32:49.080 --> 01:32:50.400]   Wrapper apps, things like that.
[01:32:50.400 --> 01:32:53.040]   But he has a-- I think I don't want to say his name.
[01:32:53.040 --> 01:32:57.880]   I don't want to get him in trouble with Apple, but he has an app that-- it makes sense for
[01:32:57.880 --> 01:32:59.640]   the multiple versions.
[01:32:59.640 --> 01:33:02.080]   And it's a fairly expensive app.
[01:33:02.080 --> 01:33:04.440]   And so you buy the version that makes sense to you.
[01:33:04.440 --> 01:33:08.720]   But he's got a solution, but he was a little bit put off by the heavy handed way Apple
[01:33:08.720 --> 01:33:14.200]   did this and the very short timeframe Apple gave him 90 days.
[01:33:14.200 --> 01:33:15.800]   I know you talked to a lot of developers, Renee.
[01:33:15.800 --> 01:33:17.640]   Have you heard similar complaints?
[01:33:17.640 --> 01:33:23.760]   Yeah, there's always like a little bit of-- I mean, they deal with so many apps every
[01:33:23.760 --> 01:33:24.760]   day.
[01:33:24.760 --> 01:33:26.360]   There's always sort of some aberration where somebody comes down.
[01:33:26.360 --> 01:33:31.080]   It was famously James Thompson with Pete Calc when they said he can't be a widget anymore.
[01:33:31.080 --> 01:33:33.280]   And sort of somebody looked at it and decided that.
[01:33:33.280 --> 01:33:37.920]   And because it's a group of individuals, they just shot off a letter or it happens over
[01:33:37.920 --> 01:33:38.920]   and over again.
[01:33:38.920 --> 01:33:42.920]   I think that's why you avail yourself of the appeal process where that people only
[01:33:42.920 --> 01:33:43.920]   up to the exact--
[01:33:43.920 --> 01:33:51.000]   Yeah, he was told no appeal for you.
[01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:52.000]   This is what you got to do.
[01:33:52.000 --> 01:33:53.000]   And he's going to do something.
[01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:56.360]   But it's a great cost, not just to him, but to people who bought the other.
[01:33:56.360 --> 01:33:57.360]   Totally.
[01:33:57.360 --> 01:33:58.360]   Yeah.
[01:33:58.360 --> 01:34:00.360]   No, it's the downside of the approach that they use for the app store.
[01:34:00.360 --> 01:34:02.360]   And he could still, I guess, escalate to Phil Schiller.
[01:34:02.360 --> 01:34:03.360]   Right.
[01:34:03.360 --> 01:34:04.360]   He's still--
[01:34:04.360 --> 01:34:05.360]   That has worked on occasion.
[01:34:05.360 --> 01:34:06.360]   Yeah.
[01:34:06.360 --> 01:34:07.360]   I mean, that has worked.
[01:34:07.360 --> 01:34:08.360]   Phil has gotten involved in those things.
[01:34:08.360 --> 01:34:09.360]   Yeah.
[01:34:09.360 --> 01:34:11.360]   And I do sympathize with Apple's desire to clean up the app store.
[01:34:11.360 --> 01:34:15.080]   In fact, they're going to face a big cleanup issue when they go to 64-bit.
[01:34:15.080 --> 01:34:16.080]   Yep.
[01:34:16.080 --> 01:34:21.360]   It means a lot of apps will not be really slow on this iPad, but not work on this iPad.
[01:34:21.360 --> 01:34:26.120]   Well, there's been huge problems historically where, for example, banks or airlines who
[01:34:26.120 --> 01:34:30.320]   built everything on-- I don't want to say ActiveX, but like really old web technology
[01:34:30.320 --> 01:34:34.840]   and all they could do for their app was basically make a web wrapper and show their web button
[01:34:34.840 --> 01:34:37.480]   for processing secure transactions.
[01:34:37.480 --> 01:34:41.440]   And some of those apps look like they're still written for iOS 4, and they've never
[01:34:41.440 --> 01:34:42.440]   updated.
[01:34:42.440 --> 01:34:45.320]   And some of that either-- some of them will be forced to update now, or they'll leave
[01:34:45.320 --> 01:34:48.480]   the app store, which will inconvenience people who use those horrible apps.
[01:34:48.480 --> 01:34:49.480]   But it's just--
[01:34:49.480 --> 01:34:52.000]   There's a problem on every app store.
[01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:53.640]   Google goes through this.
[01:34:53.640 --> 01:34:55.840]   Microsoft's going through this.
[01:34:55.840 --> 01:34:58.080]   It's just the nature of app stores.
[01:34:58.080 --> 01:35:02.120]   But it's also tough because if you're a developer and you have to live in the app store, which
[01:35:02.120 --> 01:35:08.240]   you do if you want to have an iOS app, you have to accept sometimes draconian or seemingly
[01:35:08.240 --> 01:35:09.960]   irrational rules.
[01:35:09.960 --> 01:35:12.120]   And you just-- you don't have a choice.
[01:35:12.120 --> 01:35:15.800]   You have someone famously called it animal husbandry as the closest now.
[01:35:15.800 --> 01:35:17.760]   A log, too.
[01:35:17.760 --> 01:35:21.840]   They do what's in the best interest of the Apple and then users and then developers,
[01:35:21.840 --> 01:35:25.640]   you sort of-- and if they feel it's a better experience in the app store to do this, then
[01:35:25.640 --> 01:35:27.920]   it inconveniences developers, and it's not a contest.
[01:35:27.920 --> 01:35:33.040]   It can also be difficult because sometimes people are using services and hardware that
[01:35:33.040 --> 01:35:38.440]   the app hasn't been updated in a few years, but it still works and still allows you to
[01:35:38.440 --> 01:35:42.400]   use this piece of hardware, like it's a piece of educational hardware or piece of medical
[01:35:42.400 --> 01:35:43.400]   hardware.
[01:35:43.400 --> 01:35:48.160]   But there hasn't been enough money in it for the developer to update it for everything.
[01:35:48.160 --> 01:35:53.520]   And remember that it's not just a case of importing your old code and Xcode, clicking
[01:35:53.520 --> 01:35:57.880]   a couple buttons, and then burning a new copy of it to make it compatible with iOS 9.
[01:35:57.880 --> 01:35:59.840]   iOS 10 and iOS 11.
[01:35:59.840 --> 01:36:03.120]   Oftentimes, it's, hey, if you're going to have an app in our app store, you have to
[01:36:03.120 --> 01:36:04.120]   support these APIs.
[01:36:04.120 --> 01:36:06.040]   You're going to do data access.
[01:36:06.040 --> 01:36:08.120]   You're going to have to support this data API.
[01:36:08.120 --> 01:36:12.480]   And it becomes such a nightmare that you have to really want to update this app in order
[01:36:12.480 --> 01:36:13.480]   to do it.
[01:36:13.480 --> 01:36:17.600]   So we're not going to-- I don't think it's going to be a disaster, but before we say
[01:36:17.600 --> 01:36:22.640]   that-- before anybody thinks that, oh, well, geez, what a poor, poor, poor you.
[01:36:22.640 --> 01:36:31.120]   You don't get to use your 2007, 2008 Donkey Kong rip off anymore.
[01:36:31.120 --> 01:36:34.760]   Sometimes for some people, it affects people more than that.
[01:36:34.760 --> 01:36:35.760]   Yeah.
[01:36:35.760 --> 01:36:40.600]   It's just the way-- I kind of sometimes I wish for the old days of computing where you go
[01:36:40.600 --> 01:36:44.640]   to a developer's site or you go to a store and you'd buy a shrink-grat copy and you could
[01:36:44.640 --> 01:36:46.480]   put anything on your computer you wanted.
[01:36:46.480 --> 01:36:51.240]   But I also understand the benefits that we have reaped because of closed app stores, strict
[01:36:51.240 --> 01:36:52.240]   regulations.
[01:36:52.240 --> 01:36:56.840]   You can't win because I still have friends who have to use old versions of Internet Explorer
[01:36:56.840 --> 01:36:59.720]   to access websites that were written in ActiveX.
[01:36:59.720 --> 01:37:03.720]   And Microsoft's biggest-- in some ways iTunes is Apple's version of this.
[01:37:03.720 --> 01:37:08.800]   But Windows XP, just people just governments and agencies not moving off the old technology
[01:37:08.800 --> 01:37:11.560]   stack even when they don't support the operating system anymore.
[01:37:11.560 --> 01:37:15.960]   The guy called me on the radio show said, I need to reinstall Windows Vista on my machine.
[01:37:15.960 --> 01:37:17.400]   Can you help it?
[01:37:17.400 --> 01:37:20.480]   What I really want to say is, no, I'm not going to help you do that.
[01:37:20.480 --> 01:37:21.480]   Stop.
[01:37:21.480 --> 01:37:25.160]   There's technical debt for a lot of companies and a lot of apps and a lot of industries.
[01:37:25.160 --> 01:37:27.160]   And governments are some of the worst offenders at this.
[01:37:27.160 --> 01:37:30.840]   Yeah, in fact what I said, I helped them because I understand.
[01:37:30.840 --> 01:37:35.600]   There's lots of good reasons why you might have to be running Windows Vista.
[01:37:35.600 --> 01:37:38.040]   I'm just going to think of them, but I'm sure.
[01:37:38.040 --> 01:37:41.560]   Well, for a long time it was Internet Explorer 6 or something and people just couldn't move
[01:37:41.560 --> 01:37:45.120]   off it because their internal applications were all built against when--
[01:37:45.120 --> 01:37:46.720]   You need ActiveX, right?
[01:37:46.720 --> 01:37:47.720]   Yeah.
[01:37:47.720 --> 01:37:48.720]   We're going to take a break.
[01:37:48.720 --> 01:37:51.280]   Our picks of the week coming up are shown today brought to you by those great folks at
[01:37:51.280 --> 01:37:52.680]   Dollar Shave Club.
[01:37:52.680 --> 01:37:57.600]   I've been-- Everybody knows, Dollar Shave Club sells amazing razors for just a few bucks.
[01:37:57.600 --> 01:37:59.720]   I've been a member for a while.
[01:37:59.720 --> 01:38:00.720]   Love my shave.
[01:38:00.720 --> 01:38:05.360]   Actually, before I did any of these, I joined Dollar Shave Club and I have been a-- I think
[01:38:05.360 --> 01:38:07.760]   a member for a couple of three years.
[01:38:07.760 --> 01:38:12.360]   Dollar Shave Club though knows there's a few of you who haven't tried it yet.
[01:38:12.360 --> 01:38:16.760]   In fact, they've got a new trial kit that I think is just for you.
[01:38:16.760 --> 01:38:19.640]   Dollar Shave Club doesn't just sell razors and blades.
[01:38:19.640 --> 01:38:25.880]   You've got basically your bathroom covered body wash shampoo, hair gel, lip balm, everything.
[01:38:25.880 --> 01:38:32.960]   And now for $5, you can get a starter kit that gives you the executive razor and a blade
[01:38:32.960 --> 01:38:33.960]   or two.
[01:38:33.960 --> 01:38:34.960]   What-- how many blades do you get?
[01:38:34.960 --> 01:38:35.960]   I focus that.
[01:38:35.960 --> 01:38:36.960]   Oh, that's nice.
[01:38:36.960 --> 01:38:37.960]   You get the four blades.
[01:38:37.960 --> 01:38:38.960]   That's great.
[01:38:38.960 --> 01:38:42.200]   You get the-- so this is what I get in the mail every month anyway.
[01:38:42.200 --> 01:38:43.200]   This is great.
[01:38:43.200 --> 01:38:47.040]   So the executive razor nicely weighted, nice feel-good grip.
[01:38:47.040 --> 01:38:53.000]   The four blades, you know, the cartridges with the five blades in them, the extra trimmer
[01:38:53.000 --> 01:38:56.200]   blade, the lubricated strip, nice good stuff.
[01:38:56.200 --> 01:38:58.400]   But you also get-- look what you also get.
[01:38:58.400 --> 01:38:59.480]   And this is only $5.
[01:38:59.480 --> 01:39:04.560]   You get a sample size of their body cleanser, amber and lavender.
[01:39:04.560 --> 01:39:10.080]   I love how this-- actually I have the big-- you know, the home-- the trial version at
[01:39:10.080 --> 01:39:11.080]   home.
[01:39:11.080 --> 01:39:13.520]   But hmm, I love that.
[01:39:13.520 --> 01:39:15.360]   Actually, this is sage and black pepper.
[01:39:15.360 --> 01:39:16.360]   That's another one.
[01:39:16.360 --> 01:39:22.720]   Dr. Carver's shave butter, the best, closest, smoothest shave.
[01:39:22.720 --> 01:39:26.600]   And also, because it's got aloe and other good stuff in it, it's after you shave.
[01:39:26.600 --> 01:39:29.400]   Your skin feels great all day long.
[01:39:29.400 --> 01:39:33.560]   And-- and please, don't turn up your nose at this.
[01:39:33.560 --> 01:39:37.400]   A sample pack of one-wipe Charlies.
[01:39:37.400 --> 01:39:41.120]   This every bathroom should have some one-wipe Charlies.
[01:39:41.120 --> 01:39:46.720]   You get three trial size versions of the most popular products that help you stay fresh
[01:39:46.720 --> 01:39:49.360]   and clean if you understand what I'm talking about.
[01:39:49.360 --> 01:39:52.800]   Shave butter, body wash, the butt wipes.
[01:39:52.800 --> 01:39:56.920]   After the first box, you can get replacement cartridges every month for a few bucks.
[01:39:56.920 --> 01:39:58.000]   And this is all just $5.
[01:39:58.000 --> 01:39:59.000]   I love it.
[01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:03.400]   DollarshaveClub.com/MacBreak.
[01:40:03.400 --> 01:40:06.560]   I know you have plenty of options in the store, but why go to the store when you can get
[01:40:06.560 --> 01:40:08.320]   great stuff shipped to you?
[01:40:08.320 --> 01:40:12.960]   It smells great, works great, high-quality, shave and grooming products delivered right
[01:40:12.960 --> 01:40:14.680]   to your door.
[01:40:14.680 --> 01:40:15.680]   Super high quality.
[01:40:15.680 --> 01:40:18.400]   And you'll become a fan as I have.
[01:40:18.400 --> 01:40:22.440]   DollarshaveClub.com/MacBreak.
[01:40:22.440 --> 01:40:25.440]   I love the sage and pepper shampoo.
[01:40:25.440 --> 01:40:27.440]   It's very manly.
[01:40:27.440 --> 01:40:28.440]   Mmm.
[01:40:28.440 --> 01:40:31.200]   Although, at least it keeps stealing it.
[01:40:31.200 --> 01:40:33.720]   So maybe it's womanly as well.
[01:40:33.720 --> 01:40:35.520]   It really smells good.
[01:40:35.520 --> 01:40:38.600]   ShaveClub.com/MacBreak.
[01:40:38.600 --> 01:40:40.360]   Renee Ritchie, let's kick it off with you.
[01:40:40.360 --> 01:40:42.280]   Your pick of the week, my friend.
[01:40:42.280 --> 01:40:47.400]   So this Friday was Force Friday, which is a really fancy way of saying Lucasfilm and
[01:40:47.400 --> 01:40:51.760]   Disney and Star Wars are going to show you everything that they want you to buy for the
[01:40:51.760 --> 01:40:52.760]   new holidays.
[01:40:52.760 --> 01:40:55.960]   I was wondering, it wasn't like May the 4th or anything like that.
[01:40:55.960 --> 01:41:00.960]   No, I think this started with the Force Awakens, was their first one, and now they're doubling
[01:41:00.960 --> 01:41:03.320]   down for the sequel.
[01:41:03.320 --> 01:41:04.320]   And it's effective.
[01:41:04.320 --> 01:41:08.800]   You can get an $800 Lego Millennium Falcon, not that I haven't been thinking about buying
[01:41:08.800 --> 01:41:09.800]   that over.
[01:41:09.800 --> 01:41:10.800]   Did you?
[01:41:10.800 --> 01:41:11.800]   Did you?
[01:41:11.800 --> 01:41:12.800]   No, I have nowhere to put it, Leo.
[01:41:12.800 --> 01:41:13.800]   How big is it for a hundred bucks?
[01:41:13.800 --> 01:41:14.800]   Don't tap me, Frodo.
[01:41:14.800 --> 01:41:16.800]   How big is it?
[01:41:16.800 --> 01:41:17.800]   It's big.
[01:41:17.800 --> 01:41:18.800]   It's huge.
[01:41:18.800 --> 01:41:19.800]   But it looks gorgeous.
[01:41:19.800 --> 01:41:20.800]   It's about that big.
[01:41:20.800 --> 01:41:25.880]   It's the biggest Lego set I think ever made is bigger than the legendary Millennium Falcon
[01:41:25.880 --> 01:41:28.840]   that came out like five, six, seven, eight years ago.
[01:41:28.840 --> 01:41:29.840]   Yeah.
[01:41:29.840 --> 01:41:33.880]   But I've been trying to get friends of mine to buy it for the past week because I don't
[01:41:33.880 --> 01:41:35.680]   want to buy it.
[01:41:35.680 --> 01:41:36.680]   I don't want to assemble it.
[01:41:36.680 --> 01:41:37.680]   I don't want to own it.
[01:41:37.680 --> 01:41:39.600]   I just want to visit somebody's house.
[01:41:39.600 --> 01:41:41.400]   7,541.
[01:41:41.400 --> 01:41:42.400]   Yeah.
[01:41:42.400 --> 01:41:44.880]   Good looking pieces.
[01:41:44.880 --> 01:41:48.040]   The assembly manual is an inch and something thick.
[01:41:48.040 --> 01:41:50.160]   Yeah, no, but it looks spectacular.
[01:41:50.160 --> 01:41:53.680]   But there is something that's near and dear to the subject matter of this show that was
[01:41:53.680 --> 01:41:54.840]   made available.
[01:41:54.840 --> 01:41:59.680]   And a couple of years ago, we got the BB8, the Sphero BB8 because neurotechnology was used
[01:41:59.680 --> 01:42:01.440]   in creating BB8 for the movie.
[01:42:01.440 --> 01:42:07.200]   So this year we're getting BB9E, which is a mysterious new droid from the new movie that
[01:42:07.200 --> 01:42:13.520]   we don't know much about, but also Sphero R2D2, which I think a lot of AKA's turned to Caldwell
[01:42:13.520 --> 01:42:15.760]   have been looking forward to.
[01:42:15.760 --> 01:42:17.720]   And their behaviors are like they're all robots.
[01:42:17.720 --> 01:42:19.040]   They're all controllable.
[01:42:19.040 --> 01:42:20.120]   You can use them in Sphero.
[01:42:20.120 --> 01:42:24.560]   Apple also announced that you can use Swift Playgrounds to program for them.
[01:42:24.560 --> 01:42:27.920]   They have some lessons that you can do with Swift Playgrounds.
[01:42:27.920 --> 01:42:29.000]   So these are really cool.
[01:42:29.000 --> 01:42:34.720]   They are at the superficial level, just remote control robots that you can have the R2D2
[01:42:34.720 --> 01:42:36.560]   of your dreams rolling around.
[01:42:36.560 --> 01:42:39.520]   But you can also use the app to control them better.
[01:42:39.520 --> 01:42:43.520]   You can use Swift Playgrounds to create little programs that control them.
[01:42:43.520 --> 01:42:47.000]   You can also watch the movies with them and they sort of react to the movies while you're
[01:42:47.000 --> 01:42:48.400]   watching them.
[01:42:48.400 --> 01:42:51.520]   And it's just everyone who's watched those movies always wanted a droid.
[01:42:51.520 --> 01:42:52.520]   They wanted an R2.
[01:42:52.520 --> 01:42:53.520]   They wanted the new ones.
[01:42:53.520 --> 01:42:54.520]   They wanted the BB8.
[01:42:54.520 --> 01:42:58.920]   And I think it's really fantastic that Sphero is making these, not only available, but available
[01:42:58.920 --> 01:43:04.960]   as toys, as sort of sophisticated electronic devices and as educational tools.
[01:43:04.960 --> 01:43:06.000]   And they're all available starting.
[01:43:06.000 --> 01:43:09.280]   I think Amazon had them as of last weekend.
[01:43:09.280 --> 01:43:12.200]   So if you want them for Christmas, I would act sooner rather than later because it's
[01:43:12.200 --> 01:43:15.040]   probably going to be a hot ticket item.
[01:43:15.040 --> 01:43:18.640]   But I'm just delighted that I live in a world where these things exist.
[01:43:18.640 --> 01:43:22.160]   Here's the R2D2 Sphero playing tag.
[01:43:22.160 --> 01:43:24.920]   You can see it's not huge, but it's--
[01:43:24.920 --> 01:43:25.920]   No, no.
[01:43:25.920 --> 01:43:27.160]   It looks really fun.
[01:43:27.160 --> 01:43:29.160]   It's scary.
[01:43:29.160 --> 01:43:30.160]   R2D2.
[01:43:30.160 --> 01:43:31.160]   We're on you.
[01:43:31.160 --> 01:43:34.880]   Oh, it would be fun to have all three, wouldn't it?
[01:43:34.880 --> 01:43:37.120]   Oh, man.
[01:43:37.120 --> 01:43:39.560]   So did you get them?
[01:43:39.560 --> 01:43:43.840]   No, I may or may not have ordered one as a gift for somebody else.
[01:43:43.840 --> 01:43:48.800]   I personally do not have them, but they are in an Amazon box heading towards addresses
[01:43:48.800 --> 01:43:49.800]   undisclosed.
[01:43:49.800 --> 01:43:51.680]   Well, you'll get to play with it, I'm sure.
[01:43:51.680 --> 01:43:53.680]   Yes.
[01:43:53.680 --> 01:43:54.680]   Pretty cool.
[01:43:54.680 --> 01:43:56.520]   So it is a little deceptive when you look at the pictures.
[01:43:56.520 --> 01:43:57.960]   So make sure you understand the size.
[01:43:57.960 --> 01:44:00.200]   They're only about six inches tall or something.
[01:44:00.200 --> 01:44:01.400]   But you don't want a full-scale art.
[01:44:01.400 --> 01:44:06.440]   I mean, you want a full-scale art to do what you might really want a full-scale art.
[01:44:06.440 --> 01:44:07.440]   Really?
[01:44:07.440 --> 01:44:08.960]   It looks really fun.
[01:44:08.960 --> 01:44:12.640]   And so how is the BB-9E different from BB-8?
[01:44:12.640 --> 01:44:16.920]   It's-- Russell Holli, my colleague, he took a look at them and he thought it was going
[01:44:16.920 --> 01:44:17.920]   to be just a carbon copy.
[01:44:17.920 --> 01:44:19.760]   Like he just did a different shell and same movement.
[01:44:19.760 --> 01:44:20.760]   Yeah.
[01:44:20.760 --> 01:44:23.000]   But they had to move around differently and the robot's got a different-- like he did a
[01:44:23.000 --> 01:44:25.520]   good job of sort of letting the character be different.
[01:44:25.520 --> 01:44:27.640]   I think it's really cool.
[01:44:27.640 --> 01:44:28.640]   By the way, your article.
[01:44:28.640 --> 01:44:30.000]   Or is it yours or serenity?
[01:44:30.000 --> 01:44:31.000]   It's Russell's.
[01:44:31.000 --> 01:44:33.720]   Russell's article in-- Oh, Russell Holli works for you now?
[01:44:33.720 --> 01:44:34.720]   For a long time.
[01:44:34.720 --> 01:44:35.720]   He's been working on Android Central.
[01:44:35.720 --> 01:44:36.720]   He runs our VR headset.
[01:44:36.720 --> 01:44:39.160]   Oh, oh, because he works for Android Central, of course.
[01:44:39.160 --> 01:44:40.160]   OK.
[01:44:40.160 --> 01:44:41.160]   Yeah.
[01:44:41.160 --> 01:44:42.160]   I forgot.
[01:44:42.160 --> 01:44:43.160]   Yeah.
[01:44:43.160 --> 01:44:44.160]   Look at this looking good.
[01:44:44.160 --> 01:44:45.160]   He lost some weight.
[01:44:45.160 --> 01:44:46.160]   He looked really really--
[01:44:46.160 --> 01:44:47.160]   He's awesome.
[01:44:47.160 --> 01:44:48.160]   Yeah, I love Russell.
[01:44:48.160 --> 01:44:49.160]   And so smart.
[01:44:49.160 --> 01:44:53.360]   Yeah, well, this is what happens when Lyra Airsoe dies in Rogue One.
[01:44:53.360 --> 01:44:55.360]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:44:55.360 --> 01:44:58.200]   He's having some fun with it.
[01:44:58.200 --> 01:45:00.720]   And that's a better picture for the rough size.
[01:45:00.720 --> 01:45:03.040]   It fits in the child's palm of a child's hand.
[01:45:03.040 --> 01:45:08.320]   So it's like a BB-8 body with an R5-D4 head in jet black or sort of--
[01:45:08.320 --> 01:45:11.520]   well-worn jet black, a micro-abrazed jet black.
[01:45:11.520 --> 01:45:16.320]   And while the Lego isn't available till October 1, you can get your BB-8s for 100--
[01:45:16.320 --> 01:45:17.320]   [SINGING]
[01:45:17.320 --> 01:45:20.160]   --at Amazon and other places.
[01:45:20.160 --> 01:45:21.160]   They're not cheap, but they're delightful.
[01:45:21.160 --> 01:45:22.160]   Yeah.
[01:45:22.160 --> 01:45:23.160]   And I bought the original BB-8.
[01:45:23.160 --> 01:45:24.160]   I loved it.
[01:45:24.160 --> 01:45:25.160]   Yeah.
[01:45:25.160 --> 01:45:26.160]   So much fun.
[01:45:26.160 --> 01:45:28.960]   Andy, Enoco, pick of the week, my friend.
[01:45:28.960 --> 01:45:34.560]   Mine is a Chrome browser extension plugin that I've been praying for for years.
[01:45:34.560 --> 01:45:38.160]   You get in that situation where you've got-- you're doing research or just screwing around
[01:45:38.160 --> 01:45:43.160]   and got so many browser tabs open that first you don't see the names of the tabs.
[01:45:43.160 --> 01:45:44.280]   You only see the icons.
[01:45:44.280 --> 01:45:49.280]   And then you just get this jagged sort of sawtooth thing because you've got so many tabs open
[01:45:49.280 --> 01:45:51.360]   or it's something like that.
[01:45:51.360 --> 01:45:55.360]   One tab is a browser extension that you click on this and it will take every single tab
[01:45:55.360 --> 01:46:01.080]   inside that window and close them all and put all the URLs into just a simple web page
[01:46:01.080 --> 01:46:04.120]   that it generates with just all the links.
[01:46:04.120 --> 01:46:09.520]   So essentially, instead of getting-- having 18 tabs inside this window, you now have one
[01:46:09.520 --> 01:46:14.360]   tab that has a list of links along with a couple of tools so that you can just click
[01:46:14.360 --> 01:46:19.280]   a button and just restore all of them by just simply opening those URLs or save them or
[01:46:19.280 --> 01:46:23.800]   share them as a web page to someplace else because there's again so many times where
[01:46:23.800 --> 01:46:28.840]   I'm preparing for-- I'm going to be on public radio again on Friday so I'm just doing research
[01:46:28.840 --> 01:46:30.440]   and pitching stories.
[01:46:30.440 --> 01:46:34.000]   And so I've got this one window that I can't get rid of it because that's sort of the
[01:46:34.000 --> 01:46:38.600]   state of my mind as I'm planning these 30 minutes in my head.
[01:46:38.600 --> 01:46:42.720]   But it's not worth my creating bookmarks for each and every one of these because they're
[01:46:42.720 --> 01:46:44.520]   just what I'm looking at and thinking about.
[01:46:44.520 --> 01:46:50.080]   So just click on that one button inside the tool and boom, I've got all those 11, 12 to
[01:46:50.080 --> 01:46:54.360]   15, whatever links just there in one page.
[01:46:54.360 --> 01:46:57.360]   And if I want to put it right back, I can put it right back.
[01:46:57.360 --> 01:47:01.160]   So there are a couple of advantages, number one, just getting rid of clutter.
[01:47:01.160 --> 01:47:04.960]   But also remember that when a web page is open, it's running all kinds of JavaScript
[01:47:04.960 --> 01:47:07.240]   in the background and it's hammering the CPU.
[01:47:07.240 --> 01:47:09.880]   So it's certainly going to reduce the memory load.
[01:47:09.880 --> 01:47:13.480]   It will probably extend the life of your battery a little bit if you're essentially slumbering
[01:47:13.480 --> 01:47:16.120]   all of these tabs into a link.
[01:47:16.120 --> 01:47:22.160]   The only disadvantage is that remember that all it's doing is it's saving whatever URL
[01:47:22.160 --> 01:47:23.640]   is in the address bar.
[01:47:23.640 --> 01:47:28.360]   So if you're in the middle of something, it's not as though like if you're reading like
[01:47:28.360 --> 01:47:34.280]   a 17,000 word paper or something, it's not going to leave you back at the place where
[01:47:34.280 --> 01:47:35.280]   you were scrolled before.
[01:47:35.280 --> 01:47:37.760]   It will just simply reopen that URL.
[01:47:37.760 --> 01:47:41.280]   So it's but still for everything it does, it's really wonderful.
[01:47:41.280 --> 01:47:46.200]   And if you go to the web page, of course, they are wise enough to ask the question,
[01:47:46.200 --> 01:47:47.960]   how do you make money?
[01:47:47.960 --> 01:47:51.440]   And they explain that no, we were just desperately needed this for ourselves.
[01:47:51.440 --> 01:47:52.440]   So we wrote it.
[01:47:52.440 --> 01:47:53.440]   So it's just free.
[01:47:53.440 --> 01:47:55.240]   It's hard to charge for Chrome extensions anyway.
[01:47:55.240 --> 01:47:56.240]   It's not a.
[01:47:56.240 --> 01:47:57.640]   Yes, that was probably very wise.
[01:47:57.640 --> 01:48:03.160]   But that was I was also fortunately have ghostry and all these other browser extensions that
[01:48:03.160 --> 01:48:08.360]   looks for I was wondering, okay, is there could be some sort of affiliate advertising
[01:48:08.360 --> 01:48:15.160]   talk back to all of this and nope, it doesn't fire up anything or actually hang on.
[01:48:15.160 --> 01:48:21.600]   No, okay, there's a one tracker at Google Analytics, but that's it.
[01:48:21.600 --> 01:48:22.600]   Oh, that's nothing.
[01:48:22.600 --> 01:48:25.600]   Google Analytics just means they want to know how many people use it.
[01:48:25.600 --> 01:48:26.600]   Right.
[01:48:26.600 --> 01:48:27.800]   So it is a Chrome extension.
[01:48:27.800 --> 01:48:28.800]   Yeah.
[01:48:28.800 --> 01:48:29.800]   Yeah.
[01:48:29.800 --> 01:48:30.800]   That is really a great idea.
[01:48:30.800 --> 01:48:31.800]   I'm just installed it.
[01:48:31.800 --> 01:48:32.800]   I'm not one of those people.
[01:48:32.800 --> 01:48:35.240]   Obviously you are who uses a lot of tabs.
[01:48:35.240 --> 01:48:36.840]   I believe in tab hygiene.
[01:48:36.840 --> 01:48:37.840]   I close tabs.
[01:48:37.840 --> 01:48:38.840]   Yeah, I'll maybe do that.
[01:48:38.840 --> 01:48:41.000]   I have a really have a tab zero.
[01:48:41.000 --> 01:48:43.000]   You have tab zero.
[01:48:43.000 --> 01:48:44.000]   Browser tab zero.
[01:48:44.000 --> 01:48:45.640]   Yeah, I like this with one tab.
[01:48:45.640 --> 01:48:49.400]   Good idea for Chrome extension Firefox to you said.
[01:48:49.400 --> 01:48:50.400]   It also works with Firefox.
[01:48:50.400 --> 01:48:52.000]   Yeah, very nice.
[01:48:52.000 --> 01:48:57.480]   We have a great studio audience today from all over Petaluma and San Francisco and Boston
[01:48:57.480 --> 01:49:02.840]   and Vermont and Maine, but a couple visiting us from Honolulu today.
[01:49:02.840 --> 01:49:06.880]   Victor is a developer and he has a brand new app.
[01:49:06.880 --> 01:49:10.280]   And I thought I'd give him a little plug because it's a great idea for an app called
[01:49:10.280 --> 01:49:11.280]   M. Foodie.
[01:49:11.280 --> 01:49:14.720]   I don't know about you, but I love farmers markets.
[01:49:14.720 --> 01:49:19.960]   Would you like to know what farmers markets are near you as you travel around M. Foodie
[01:49:19.960 --> 01:49:20.960]   does that?
[01:49:20.960 --> 01:49:22.400]   You can discover farmers markets.
[01:49:22.400 --> 01:49:25.200]   I didn't know this USDA has a database.
[01:49:25.200 --> 01:49:26.200]   So this taps into that.
[01:49:26.200 --> 01:49:30.200]   So it's up to date all over the US and its territories.
[01:49:30.200 --> 01:49:35.800]   And then also has a tab for vendors and so you can vendors can talk.
[01:49:35.800 --> 01:49:36.800]   I didn't realize this.
[01:49:36.800 --> 01:49:39.680]   There are 8,600 farmers markets in the US.
[01:49:39.680 --> 01:49:46.680]   You could find markets by day, location, name, hours of operation, search near monuments.
[01:49:46.680 --> 01:49:50.840]   So you can say, where's the best farmers market near the space needle?
[01:49:50.840 --> 01:49:53.360]   Etcetera, etcetera, etcetera.
[01:49:53.360 --> 01:49:58.680]   And he's going to make it possible for people who represent markets or vendors to get a
[01:49:58.680 --> 01:50:03.400]   free web page with M. Foodie information and an easy to read fact sheet style, which is
[01:50:03.400 --> 01:50:05.440]   I think a really nice idea.
[01:50:05.440 --> 01:50:08.400]   Obviously, he's a fan of the farmers markets.
[01:50:08.400 --> 01:50:11.520]   M. Foodie is free, right?
[01:50:11.520 --> 01:50:12.520]   You no charge.
[01:50:12.520 --> 01:50:15.640]   Thank you, Victor, for making that possible.
[01:50:15.640 --> 01:50:17.240]   I think it's a great idea.
[01:50:17.240 --> 01:50:22.560]   You might want to download it on the App Store and put it on your phone or your tablet.
[01:50:22.560 --> 01:50:23.920]   It's an iPhone app.
[01:50:23.920 --> 01:50:27.280]   Mfoodie.com.
[01:50:27.280 --> 01:50:32.480]   Thank you, everybody, for a great show the last week, the last Macbrick weekly of the
[01:50:32.480 --> 01:50:35.400]   iPhone 7 era.
[01:50:35.400 --> 01:50:37.400]   It is all about to chain.
[01:50:37.400 --> 01:50:42.440]   The last week of three months where you have to say there's really nothing to talk about.
[01:50:42.440 --> 01:50:44.440]   Thank you, everybody.
[01:50:44.440 --> 01:50:48.520]   Actually, ARKit's going to give us a lot to talk about over the next months.
[01:50:48.520 --> 01:50:49.520]   Thank goodness.
[01:50:49.520 --> 01:50:51.440]   And I have a feeling there'll be a few other things involved.
[01:50:51.440 --> 01:50:54.960]   We didn't even mention there'll be a new Apple, Series 3 Apple Watch as well.
[01:50:54.960 --> 01:50:56.840]   But we'll find out all about it.
[01:50:56.840 --> 01:51:02.480]   Our live broadcast 10 AM Pacific 1 PM Eastern 1700 UTC.
[01:51:02.480 --> 01:51:04.480]   We'll be in this time slot.
[01:51:04.480 --> 01:51:07.480]   We'll move iOS today to Wednesday for obvious reasons.
[01:51:07.480 --> 01:51:10.200]   We don't really want to do a show before the Apple event.
[01:51:10.200 --> 01:51:12.160]   So we'll be doing that Wednesday morning.
[01:51:12.160 --> 01:51:14.560]   Megan and I and Alex Lindsey will come in a little bit early.
[01:51:14.560 --> 01:51:16.040]   We'll do the live event.
[01:51:16.040 --> 01:51:19.080]   If you want to watch the live stream, Apple has its own live stream that you can watch.
[01:51:19.080 --> 01:51:21.880]   Of course, you have to have an Apple device usually to watch that in Safari.
[01:51:21.880 --> 01:51:23.520]   Or Edge, I think, does it too?
[01:51:23.520 --> 01:51:24.760]   Oh, Edge can do it.
[01:51:24.760 --> 01:51:25.760]   I believe so.
[01:51:25.760 --> 01:51:26.960]   If you have Windows, you can watch it on Edge.
[01:51:26.960 --> 01:51:28.720]   Well, we'll see.
[01:51:28.720 --> 01:51:32.280]   But you can always watch our stream on any device.
[01:51:32.280 --> 01:51:36.240]   But the only negative in that is you'll hear our snarky comments behind the scenes.
[01:51:36.240 --> 01:51:37.240]   Positive.
[01:51:37.240 --> 01:51:38.240]   Positive.
[01:51:38.240 --> 01:51:39.240]   No, you know what?
[01:51:39.240 --> 01:51:41.640]   We try to give you context and understanding.
[01:51:41.640 --> 01:51:46.560]   We also will exclaim ooze and awws if there's something to oo and aww about.
[01:51:46.560 --> 01:51:51.400]   We have the understanding that if you wanted to watch this without any commentary whatsoever,
[01:51:51.400 --> 01:51:54.440]   there is an actual Apple fee that you can be watching.
[01:51:54.440 --> 01:51:55.440]   There is a way to do it.
[01:51:55.440 --> 01:52:00.680]   That you have opted in by watching our live stream to having us say things.
[01:52:00.680 --> 01:52:05.080]   This is kind of ironic because people will always tune in saying, "Why are they talking?
[01:52:05.080 --> 01:52:06.080]   I want to watch."
[01:52:06.080 --> 01:52:08.280]   Well, you can.
[01:52:08.280 --> 01:52:10.640]   This is the channel where we talk.
[01:52:10.640 --> 01:52:12.600]   And I hope you will join us because there's always a lot of fun.
[01:52:12.600 --> 01:52:14.680]   It's always an event when Apple has something to announce.
[01:52:14.680 --> 01:52:20.280]   And we'll look for you in the crowd, Renee, somewhere there with Serenity and a bunch
[01:52:20.280 --> 01:52:22.600]   of other people from iMore.com.
[01:52:22.600 --> 01:52:24.000]   We do Mac Break Weekly.
[01:52:24.000 --> 01:52:28.560]   Normally, except for next week, we do it normally at 11 a.m. Pacific, 2 p.m. Eastern time.
[01:52:28.560 --> 01:52:29.560]   It's 1800 UTC.
[01:52:29.560 --> 01:52:34.320]   We'll probably start around noon next week to make way for the Apple event.
[01:52:34.320 --> 01:52:38.800]   You can tune in live, watch us, or anything we do live at twit.tv/live.
[01:52:38.800 --> 01:52:45.600]   I should point out if you have an Amazon Echo, you can listen live by simply saying echo,
