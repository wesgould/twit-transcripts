[00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:01.440]   Andy and I go from the Chicago Sun times great to see you Andrew
[00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:07.440]   Hello I think of myself more as a brand influencer than a thought leader just warm money in it
[00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:11.440]   Yes, I'm an early adopter. I'm afraid I don't influence anything
[00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:15.440]   Also here Renee except that when I adopted then they could discontinue it
[00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:21.440]   Renee Richie is also here from imore.com. Oh new you moved the camera around a little bit
[00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:26.440]   I had to I had to I was staging where I live so I had to like move all this stuff around to make the rooms look more open
[00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:29.440]   Are you selling the selling the place?
[00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:35.440]   I might be I'm considering it. I'm looking into it. I actually like this view because I've never seen your beautiful movie posters before
[00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:39.440]   I'm an early adopter. I just take whatever is new and try my best to live with it
[00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:42.440]   That's good. It's all about the watch fans, baby
[00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:49.440]   It looks like it looks like you and I would have exactly the same sort of like thinking that okay
[00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:54.440]   I'm gonna leave like the office exactly the way it is and therefore the realtor can say and do you have like a
[00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:58.440]   10 to 10 to 16 year old boy? Well, this could be this is what his bedroom would look like
[00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:04.440]   That's so true I laugh because it's true. Yes
[00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:09.440]   So we are now in the slump period
[00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:16.440]   Kind of in between the release of the Apple Watch series three the Apple TV HD
[00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:21.440]   Or 4k the iPhone 8 and waiting for the iPhone
[00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:27.440]   10 10 days away from the launch the we could start the countdown
[00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:30.440]   I almost taste it
[00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:36.000]   There isn't I mean it's funny because once the 10 is announced that ended the rumor mill so there aren't any
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.040]   There we have all this iPhone 9 rumors are really yeah
[00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:43.160]   What will they do by the way? Will they will they call well they call you what?
[00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:51.600]   I phone you know what will they what will they remove from the iPhone 10? I think that the screen Andy the screen
[00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:59.240]   Yeah, we're close to being able to remove the lightning port right because then you'd have no holes at all and just like
[00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:03.280]   There was rumors that Google would do that this year with the pixel but they didn't they only went part of the way
[00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:07.160]   So what do you think is that an homage to delete the headphone jack?
[00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:16.960]   I know you've heard I keep thinking that I keep coming back to the analogy of the first airline to charge baggage fees for check bag
[00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:18.960]   Yeah, it's not as though it had to happen
[00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:25.360]   And somebody had to have when it cut talk about courage you talk about let's have the courage to see if we can get away
[00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:29.080]   With this and then once everyone else found out that it's not that it's not like touching the third rail
[00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:33.400]   It it gave a lot of other companies and other designs to say well
[00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:39.760]   It would make our lives simpler and our meaning our design the designers simply if we didn't have to mess with a with a headphone jack
[00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:44.800]   And particularly when you're building an Android phone when you know that you will not be
[00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:51.480]   Essentially killing everybody's access to a headphone jack everywhere and if anything you could say the oh see look how modern
[00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:56.240]   We are we're even more like the iPhone than the last Android phone to copy the iPhone
[00:04:56.240 --> 00:05:01.760]   Yes, exactly the point Ron Amario made in his review of the new pixel twos
[00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:08.440]   He said this doesn't benefit end users, but it right it is of benefit to the manufacturers
[00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:11.400]   Renee what were you gonna say I was good?
[00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:13.880]   Well, it's not like we were talked about this a couple weeks ago
[00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:18.360]   We all had HTC phones 10 years ago that got rid of the headphone jack and have these weird little dongles
[00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:21.440]   I think the HTC G1 yeah first Google phone was like that
[00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:26.960]   But that was a day when we put a lot of music on our phones that was totally but there were rumors that
[00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:33.760]   Maybe Google now or some other manufacturer a lot of manufacturers seem to want to be able to a get rid of all buttons and get rid of all ports
[00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:35.840]   Get rid of every possible point of hardware failure
[00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:40.360]   Because it'll make the phones either more durable or able to make them use little you know perfectly sealed bricks
[00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:44.360]   That'll just last longer and it just it seems like a trend in the industry
[00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:46.640]   I guess the stuff has to go away at some point
[00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:50.520]   The only thing with the pixels that they didn't include light not lightning on call it
[00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:54.560]   They didn't include USB headphones in it and Apple did include lightning headphones
[00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:56.800]   So it makes it a little bit more painful for people
[00:05:56.800 --> 00:06:03.760]   Yeah, that was definitely a mistake particularly given the price of the pixel like so also particularly given that we're not Apple has some excuses
[00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:06.560]   It's can rely on some excuses in that they are shipping
[00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:10.160]   overall like 10 million of these a quarter whereas
[00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:17.520]   The app Google's ambitions are as big as apples, but their shipping quantities are about one-tenth of that
[00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:20.800]   So they can simply they can make decisions based on shipping
[00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:28.080]   800,000 units a quarter even 500,000 units a quarter and make that stick. It's so you kind of ask yourself
[00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:30.080]   Why didn't they try to make this?
[00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:34.080]   The one of the best eight to nine hundred dollar phones on the market today
[00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:37.480]   I like I liked so much of what I've seen from it so far, but
[00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:44.600]   It's such so simple to just include the damn dongle in the box particularly when you know how much hassle it's gonna create for people
[00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:53.280]   Johnny I've interviewed at the iPhone launch by a Japanese fashion and design site Brutus
[00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:58.560]   Casa figures that Johnny had give the interview to Japanese fashion and design site
[00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:05.480]   Here's here's some of the quotes. This is from nine to five Mac before this there was a feeling that individual components
[00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:08.680]   Called enclosure housing and display
[00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:12.680]   Existed existed what we always wanted to do is tackle the essence of
[00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:18.360]   Integrating what we consider different parts looking at the iPhone 10 from that perspective. I think it took many years and
[00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:20.880]   We were finally able to achieve it
[00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:28.520]   So the idea that it's a unitary object a single slab of glass as opposed to individual components, you know screwed together
[00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:33.520]   He then said we have a lot more big ideas and we're already working on them
[00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:40.560]   Rather than one ending of the iPhone. It's rather a new chapter and the beginning of its development. So I think he's really
[00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:47.240]   Saying and I guess this explains the naming a little bit and answers maybe the question of
[00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:50.080]   What's gonna happen next year?
[00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:57.200]   If there is an iPhone 9 it'll be a continuation of the existing line, but I think that's come to an end
[00:07:57.200 --> 00:07:59.640]   I think that might be the end this is the new beginning
[00:07:59.640 --> 00:08:03.240]   Yeah, so there won't be a 9 they'll be whatever X the second X is
[00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:05.240]   I
[00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:09.320]   Asked whether there was a pressure to release the new design by the 10th anniversary of the phone
[00:08:09.320 --> 00:08:14.160]   He agreed there was but claimed ultimately it was a wonderful coincidence
[00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:19.360]   Well, haha just for the design team and engineer team if you're trying to do a good job
[00:08:19.360 --> 00:08:22.760]   There's always pressure. I understand that what is expected is a change
[00:08:22.760 --> 00:08:26.840]   But we were trying to keep in mind is always do the best job as much as possible given the years
[00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:32.360]   Taken to develop the iPhone 10. It was a truly wonderful coincidence. So it is a good time to last year they would have
[00:08:32.360 --> 00:08:37.320]   Yeah, it's not really the 10th anniversary iPhone. It's the next chapter for iPhone
[00:08:37.320 --> 00:08:40.200]   Yeah, so in what regard is the next chapter?
[00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:44.680]   It takes a lot of the things that were super familiar to it like what made an iPhone like
[00:08:44.680 --> 00:08:50.120]   Iconically what made an iPhone an iPhone was that home button you even saw it in a little tiny glyphs that they used in all their products
[00:08:50.120 --> 00:08:53.200]   And it throws a lot of that away tries to introduce some new paradigms
[00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:58.840]   But it really is a rethinking of what Apple's whole design language for those mobile devices is going to be
[00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:03.720]   Yeah, also it's I think it's a continuation of it started with 3d touch
[00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:09.640]   which is the ability to kind of create more functionality without creating more
[00:09:09.640 --> 00:09:12.840]   physical clicky buttons or in physical
[00:09:12.840 --> 00:09:14.240]   obvious
[00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:20.000]   Interfaces on the surface because when you think about it when you have obviously when you have a home button you have a home button everywhere
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:24.880]   And that used to be seen as a huge advantage that no matter how confused you get within the interface
[00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:29.080]   There's always that emergency check button that will take you they'll bounce you all the way back to the home screen
[00:09:29.400 --> 00:09:35.000]   Volume buttons are always exactly where you're supposed to be the the power or whatever they're calling it right now button
[00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:41.160]   It's always where it's supposed to be. I think they're moving towards a place where they can essentially create any surface to do any
[00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:49.000]   control that they want to put in which means that they can create they can really change what an iPhone is in five years without having to change the entire body
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:53.480]   design without having to train people on this is why this is why there is a
[00:09:54.040 --> 00:10:01.840]   There is a section of the top part of the bezel that you can stroke from left to right and also responds to a press and swipe up
[00:10:01.840 --> 00:10:07.880]   It's it's basically just like the removal of the physical keyboard from the phone
[00:10:07.880 --> 00:10:14.640]   meant that if you didn't want to use that part of the screen for a keyboard if you wanted to use it use it as like a
[00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:17.320]   Video scrub controller it could be a video scrub controller
[00:10:17.320 --> 00:10:19.960]   So it really makes it into a more abstract device
[00:10:19.960 --> 00:10:24.040]   It's a challenge though because you have now a whole bunch of applications that are designed
[00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:31.280]   around the notion that you're gonna have an exit with the home button yeah, and they I mean
[00:10:31.280 --> 00:10:35.160]   I don't like about the iPhone is that there the
[00:10:35.160 --> 00:10:39.840]   Applications don't have an exit it's mostly abstracted though
[00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:45.720]   like the same thing with Face ID and touch ID is that it's a bio authentication API and it just happens to be surfaced in different ways and
[00:10:45.720 --> 00:10:52.600]   There are exit APIs that you know when you press the home button the app goes into hibernation does these things and when you swipe up all of that internally
[00:10:52.600 --> 00:10:57.680]   My understanding is that's all the same so from from an app development point of view and the API point of view
[00:10:57.680 --> 00:11:02.760]   It's identical. It's just a new mechanic that you'll learn you don't have to like me only the user changes not the app
[00:11:02.760 --> 00:11:06.000]   Yeah, and people like me who love like webOS with I love that up gesture on there
[00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.840]   I was I found it really natural I was within three minutes at the
[00:11:08.840 --> 00:11:09.880]   iPhone event
[00:11:09.880 --> 00:11:12.960]   I was just swiping up to stop everything or to move everything on the iPhone 10
[00:11:13.280 --> 00:11:16.200]   Okay, yeah, so that's gonna be the question and you've played with it
[00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:21.960]   So you can you can somewhat answer that go ahead Andy. Yeah, I do wonder if there's gonna be I wouldn't call it blowback
[00:11:21.960 --> 00:11:29.640]   But if there's gonna be a generation of designers who sort of are get bored by the lack of feature physical features on the device
[00:11:29.640 --> 00:11:33.000]   And they go back and their inspiration will be taken from
[00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:39.720]   Modern cars that are super electronic, but they also want to make sure that the shift knob has this really pleasing
[00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:46.520]   tactile feel to it when you're moving from first to second or even being inspired by a
[00:11:46.520 --> 00:11:51.240]   Curta calculator, which is certainly not as fast as as any modern calculator
[00:11:51.240 --> 00:11:58.000]   But there's something very pleasantly tactile as you wrote to is you set the you set the the levers and you rotated to get the answer
[00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:01.160]   or even the
[00:12:01.160 --> 00:12:04.400]   my favorite HP calculators the kind that had that sort of
[00:12:05.880 --> 00:12:11.760]   Parallelogram like keys that had like two or three surfaces on top of them the way that you press into them
[00:12:11.760 --> 00:12:16.040]   And they just really feed back in a really lovely way. I'm just wondering if
[00:12:16.040 --> 00:12:23.000]   Love designers often go from an emotional point of view because they're selling based on emotional features
[00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.120]   It's not just what this phone or what this device can do
[00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:29.960]   It's how it makes you feel when you use it and perhaps in a world in which people are
[00:12:30.320 --> 00:12:35.400]   Less and less sure of what's going on around them and about their level of power and control
[00:12:35.400 --> 00:12:42.280]   Maybe there might be a thought a lot of thought that says that we're not we're not gonna make this things just studded with buttons
[00:12:42.280 --> 00:12:49.000]   But let's have a couple of really nice buttons on there that attack very important features that are nonetheless
[00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:53.600]   Very attractive to hold and push and fidget with when you have this thing in your hand
[00:12:53.600 --> 00:12:57.240]   I just think it gets kind of boring when you just have oh look
[00:12:57.240 --> 00:13:02.160]   It's another flat rectangle with rounded edges with no buttons whatsoever like okay
[00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:04.240]   Yeah, it's nothing bad about it
[00:13:04.240 --> 00:13:11.240]   But the thing that stands out is the thing that's different just just like the iPhone stood out because it was a wonderful
[00:13:11.240 --> 00:13:16.840]   Innovation compared other phones, but also stood out because my goodness. I can see I've got this entire screen
[00:13:16.840 --> 00:13:19.440]   That's not being cluttered with mechanical interface anymore
[00:13:19.440 --> 00:13:26.920]   So when your entire world is glass interfaces the the machine that just decides to put you this give you this really nice
[00:13:27.200 --> 00:13:30.640]   dare I say, you know handguns style mechanical
[00:13:30.640 --> 00:13:38.040]   Metal switch on the side that does something that's critical to the function of the thing that gets you interested in a in a world
[00:13:38.040 --> 00:13:42.280]   Where you're using most people are using phones for the same things no matter what platform they're using
[00:13:42.280 --> 00:13:44.560]   Louis Manti will save us all Andy. I
[00:13:44.560 --> 00:13:48.280]   Think any you're channeling Johnny. I've exactly
[00:13:48.280 --> 00:13:54.720]   And of course people like us who obsessively pay attention to the details
[00:13:55.560 --> 00:14:01.640]   Will you know have a different reaction perhaps than a somebody somebody who spent the last seven ten years a
[00:14:01.640 --> 00:14:07.680]   Customizing themselves to how an iPhone works and one of the things of the iPhone one of the really advantages the iPhone had
[00:14:07.680 --> 00:14:12.200]   Is unlike Android there really was you know one way to do it
[00:14:12.200 --> 00:14:17.680]   You just did it that way and you really could have the muscle memory develop over time and you might have a smart
[00:14:17.680 --> 00:14:21.440]   Like they kept iPhone 8 on the market the same year so you have that choice
[00:14:21.440 --> 00:14:26.760]   It's not like previous years where oh suddenly all the phones are big and I like smaller phones and Apple screwed me and left me alone
[00:14:26.760 --> 00:14:29.520]   And it took 18 months to get an iPhone SE now
[00:14:29.520 --> 00:14:35.800]   It's like I really love the home button all I want is a better faster phone the better camera. Why can't oh it's there?
[00:14:35.800 --> 00:14:38.080]   I can buy that I don't have to have this change of origin
[00:14:38.080 --> 00:14:42.000]   I'll get the iPhone that I'm comfortable with I can watch other people be victimized by this
[00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:44.640]   I was home button less phone and then maybe next year
[00:14:44.640 --> 00:14:45.480]   I'll take a look at it
[00:14:45.480 --> 00:14:50.360]   So I think Johnny doesn't expect or Apple doesn't expect ever you know a lot of people to buy the 10 the 10 is for a
[00:14:51.200 --> 00:14:52.400]   a
[00:14:52.400 --> 00:14:58.840]   Particular and relatively small audience for an iPhone plus they can't make is a can't make iPhone scale. Yeah exactly
[00:14:58.840 --> 00:15:02.440]   Yeah, but but absolutely they're okay with that though because it's a special
[00:15:02.440 --> 00:15:08.120]   It's for it's the early adopter phone. It's the it's almost a I think beta
[00:15:08.120 --> 00:15:10.960]   Yeah, and I think that Apple wouldn't have a
[00:15:10.960 --> 00:15:18.240]   Philosophically I don't think Apple would have a problem doing something that is so radically different as the iPhone 10 from the different from the iPhone 7
[00:15:18.520 --> 00:15:22.600]   And I think that if they could get those 3d.op project projectors at scale
[00:15:22.600 --> 00:15:27.480]   I'm not sure if they would have done the iPhone 8 or at least not in the way that they've done it right now
[00:15:27.480 --> 00:15:29.200]   but
[00:15:29.200 --> 00:15:34.960]   Apple is definitely in a position though where they have to deal with they're they're not just they're not the phone for the rest of us
[00:15:34.960 --> 00:15:40.200]   They are I think the single most popular individual make of phone out there right now
[00:15:40.200 --> 00:15:45.000]   Which means that there are a lot of people who simply walk into a store. They say I've got
[00:15:45.600 --> 00:15:49.040]   $73 I want a good phone show me the three
[00:15:49.040 --> 00:15:54.040]   Good phones that to to the average consumers perception are almost identical to each other
[00:15:54.040 --> 00:15:59.720]   Okay, there's something that no one can predict that made me want phone B instead of phone A or phone C
[00:15:59.720 --> 00:16:02.160]   Thank you very much. And then you they've completely forget about
[00:16:02.160 --> 00:16:09.920]   Their their choice. So there are gonna be those people that are really going to be coming in not wanting to have it explained to them
[00:16:09.920 --> 00:16:14.200]   How face ID works? They don't want to have explained to them why there's a tab at the top of the screen
[00:16:14.640 --> 00:16:19.280]   They don't want to have to explain to them. Why do videos look a little bit funny from their point of view
[00:16:19.280 --> 00:16:24.480]   They just again, they're they they walk in with a dead phone. They want to walk out with a good phone
[00:16:24.480 --> 00:16:29.560]   So Apple has to make sure that they take care of those customers needs as well as they'll get in a
[00:16:29.560 --> 00:16:38.200]   Or even a seven right now, right? Yeah, it's it's it's hard to it's really hard to explain to people the difference between the seven and the eight
[00:16:38.200 --> 00:16:42.120]   Which is I'm not we're not trying to agree with you
[00:16:42.120 --> 00:16:48.880]   We're trying to convince people to buy the 8 and 7 but you really have to ask them a few serious questions before telling them
[00:16:48.880 --> 00:16:54.480]   Well, you know what if you've got an iPhone 5 I think you're gonna be you're gonna be blown away by the iPhone 7
[00:16:54.480 --> 00:16:58.800]   If you want to be blown away plus another hundred dollars by the iPhone 8 go for it
[00:16:58.800 --> 00:17:02.640]   But I think it was more expensive on some carriers some carriers are subsidized in the 8 way more
[00:17:02.640 --> 00:17:04.640]   You're kidding really?
[00:17:04.640 --> 00:17:08.160]   My father got a way better deal on an 8 than he got on a 7 huh?
[00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:12.560]   Huh, I wonder why they're doing that so it makes sense then that
[00:17:12.560 --> 00:17:19.640]   Apple doesn't mind that the low production numbers on an iPhone 10
[00:17:19.640 --> 00:17:26.040]   But what bothers me a little bit is is the 10 that different I understand it
[00:17:26.040 --> 00:17:31.240]   You know, we've said this over and over again Apple's got to look for the next big thing the successor to the iPhone
[00:17:31.240 --> 00:17:34.320]   You have something that's successful. It's very tempting just to write it down
[00:17:34.960 --> 00:17:41.160]   to the ground any company worth its metal is gonna try to come up with the next big thing
[00:17:41.160 --> 00:17:46.280]   Maybe the next big thing is is an iPhone but a different kind if that's the case though
[00:17:46.280 --> 00:17:51.000]   I don't see the 10 is being so very different. It almost feels more design different really than
[00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:57.120]   Functionally different. Yeah, there is that come to it. I think that if there's an influence from the Apple Watch
[00:17:57.120 --> 00:18:02.320]   It's the knowledge that Apple is a design company as much as they are an engineering company
[00:18:02.320 --> 00:18:08.880]   And we've there's there's the long long conversation about how over design is interactively intertwined with engineering and okay
[00:18:08.880 --> 00:18:09.680]   Yes, that's true
[00:18:09.680 --> 00:18:14.280]   But there is a point at which Apple is they they like things that look great
[00:18:14.280 --> 00:18:19.320]   They like things that make your heart skip a beat and which the watch then warns you about that your heart skipped a
[00:18:19.320 --> 00:18:24.880]   Beep. Oh, no, you're an apple store. So it's okay. So so honestly, I think I think it's even okay with Apple
[00:18:24.880 --> 00:18:31.320]   If it's the fact that we have this premium phone that has no bezels to it that has that even that has that interesting tab to it
[00:18:31.320 --> 00:18:36.320]   That really just feels with it and that really great stainless steel look to the back of it
[00:18:36.320 --> 00:18:42.040]   If the only reason why people want to spend an extra hundred dollars for it is because it looks like a beautiful piece of jewelry
[00:18:42.040 --> 00:18:50.520]   Compared to the fairly utilitarian iPhone 8 and iPhone 7 that's fine by them. That's a that's a good enough reason to do the iPhone 10. Yeah
[00:18:50.520 --> 00:18:58.560]   Okay, so it can't be that different because I get the needs of the needs of the customer are still very similar even
[00:18:58.560 --> 00:19:02.400]   The divine design of the phone. Yeah, I guess it's true and I'm also wondering maybe if
[00:19:02.400 --> 00:19:10.200]   Well for instance the the biggest change is face ID in fact Ming chi quote now says
[00:19:10.200 --> 00:19:18.760]   The face ID will replace touch ID in the phones going forward, which would make sense right there. Yeah, that's no big surprise
[00:19:18.760 --> 00:19:25.240]   But one of the key things about the face ID is all of those sensors are rated in that notch
[00:19:26.840 --> 00:19:33.400]   Which would incidentally be really remarkable for augmented reality, but for one thing they're facing the wrong way
[00:19:33.400 --> 00:19:37.600]   So maybe what this also could be is okay
[00:19:37.600 --> 00:19:40.000]   Well, we want to perfect this we want face ID to work
[00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:44.660]   But if we can get the cost down on these sensors and and really kind of perfect it
[00:19:44.660 --> 00:19:49.000]   Maybe they'll be facing the other way next time and that really will be an augmented reality phone
[00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:55.560]   Is that probably slightly different sensors because this this sensor is really a tune like it splashing your face with infrared light doing a contrast
[00:19:56.000 --> 00:20:00.280]   Dot pattern and then pulling that out with the two that they could put a true camera
[00:20:00.280 --> 00:20:03.520]   What they need though to do really are excellent
[00:20:03.520 --> 00:20:08.240]   Alex were here because I think you need a lot some different sensors to do the room measurements
[00:20:08.240 --> 00:20:13.720]   Identical you just take the whole module and flip it, but it's a
[00:20:13.720 --> 00:20:16.240]   But what you are doing and for instance
[00:20:16.240 --> 00:20:18.240]   I
[00:20:18.240 --> 00:20:22.680]   Talk to the guy who works for a company that makes the proximity sensor in the iPhone
[00:20:22.680 --> 00:20:26.960]   And he said the real challenge is not making these things but making a hundred and fifty million
[00:20:26.960 --> 00:20:32.360]   And the way you get good at that is you is you ramp the market up
[00:20:32.360 --> 00:20:38.560]   You and it was easy when Apple wasn't Apple and the iPhone wasn't the iPhone with the early iPhones
[00:20:38.560 --> 00:20:40.560]   You could slowly get better and better
[00:20:40.560 --> 00:20:45.640]   This is every year like touch ID two chips were hugely constrained and the I think the AH chip was hugely
[00:20:45.640 --> 00:20:48.120]   Well, that's what I'm trying to yeah, it's not wondering
[00:20:48.520 --> 00:20:54.840]   That's kind of also the role of the iPhone 10 is to start ramping up knowledge production skills
[00:20:54.840 --> 00:21:01.760]   To make it next year's yeah, that is really different next year in other words. It is an interim. It's still an interim product
[00:21:01.760 --> 00:21:05.560]   Yeah, but my understanding is that the
[00:21:05.560 --> 00:21:11.920]   The 3d technology that's in face ID is not suitable for much of anything except for doing face ID
[00:21:11.920 --> 00:21:15.520]   Which is a lot of technology and a lot of expense to build in yeah
[00:21:15.760 --> 00:21:20.960]   Yeah, and nonetheless, I think that they're going to get a lot of information about how to do
[00:21:20.960 --> 00:21:28.520]   Fast relevant and useful 3d scanning just from all the face ID stuff that they do over the course of the next year
[00:21:28.520 --> 00:21:30.320]   the reason
[00:21:30.320 --> 00:21:33.840]   Project tango from Google is getting a lot of getting a lot of heats ago
[00:21:33.840 --> 00:21:38.760]   Oh, see you have you barely shipped a phone and it's experimental Apple decided to put this on every single phone
[00:21:38.880 --> 00:21:46.120]   There they never really saw it as a way to to unlock a phone. They were seeing it as a way of mapping a room
[00:21:46.120 --> 00:21:49.360]   So that's why that hardware it can sense that there's a doorway
[00:21:49.360 --> 00:21:54.920]   Eight feet away from you and here's the dimensions of that doorway or here's the sofa and if you walk around the sofa
[00:21:54.920 --> 00:21:57.160]   Congratulations, it knows how much air
[00:21:57.160 --> 00:22:03.640]   That sofa displaces and that's it's also why project tango phones look so weird because again
[00:22:03.640 --> 00:22:07.800]   That's that's such a that's such a big deal to be able to do that particularly in a mobile device
[00:22:07.840 --> 00:22:11.680]   But again, it's not that it's not that this is a limited technology that Apple is doing
[00:22:11.680 --> 00:22:16.680]   It means that this is what they what they they would not have put it in in a project tango sort of way saying
[00:22:16.680 --> 00:22:20.440]   This is a great. I we think this is a great idea. We don't know what people gonna use it for
[00:22:20.440 --> 00:22:24.400]   We're gonna build some developer hardware and hopefully developers will find a good use for it
[00:22:24.400 --> 00:22:29.280]   They would find out is there a way we can make we can make it the phone
[00:22:29.280 --> 00:22:36.120]   Easier to unlock and then that's when the team that has always been pushing for some sort of 3d scanning on device would say aha
[00:22:37.080 --> 00:22:39.440]   Remember you heart you remember you bought our company five years ago?
[00:22:39.440 --> 00:22:46.520]   Well, can we now have a meeting with somebody because we have a great technology for you like this Tim Cookin is interview with the UK
[00:22:46.520 --> 00:22:49.080]   publication the independent
[00:22:49.080 --> 00:22:53.040]   Kind of echoed what we've we've been saying with AR he compares
[00:22:53.040 --> 00:22:59.600]   He compares it to the app story says the app store was greeted with skepticism when it launched
[00:22:59.600 --> 00:23:04.280]   Think back to 2008 quote when the app store went live
[00:23:04.280 --> 00:23:07.200]   This was the initial there was the initial round of apps people looked at them said
[00:23:07.200 --> 00:23:11.600]   This is not anything mobile apps are not gonna take off and then and which people are saying right now
[00:23:11.600 --> 00:23:16.880]   But they are by the way I am and then step-by-step things start to move. It's sort of a curve
[00:23:16.880 --> 00:23:19.560]   It was just exponential and now you couldn't imagine life without apps
[00:23:19.560 --> 00:23:24.000]   AR is like that he says it will be dramatic so not
[00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:30.120]   By by starting the platform starting the AR kit starting the movement getting developers into it
[00:23:30.120 --> 00:23:34.760]   Yes initially most of the apps are used once demo apps
[00:23:34.760 --> 00:23:40.080]   But that's how it begins and you need to see the market and get people doing that
[00:23:40.080 --> 00:23:43.800]   It was like past book took two years before Apple pay showed up
[00:23:43.800 --> 00:23:46.000]   But then when Apple pay showed up they had the wallet in place
[00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:47.960]   They had the authentication mechanism place
[00:23:47.960 --> 00:23:52.520]   They had the card mechanism in place and you had people already familiar with the idea of having cards on your phone
[00:23:52.520 --> 00:23:55.600]   And they do that a lot they don't want to tip their hat at the technology
[00:23:55.600 --> 00:24:00.080]   They're gonna release but they need to get like size classes show up and you think oh maybe they'll what are they gonna do with that?
[00:24:00.080 --> 00:24:04.160]   And all of a sudden you have different sized phones and split view on iPad and all these different things
[00:24:04.160 --> 00:24:07.720]   So it also explains why the a11 bionic is so overpowered
[00:24:07.720 --> 00:24:10.520]   Right there's really no need for that chip
[00:24:10.520 --> 00:24:13.080]   There's head there's a massive headroom
[00:24:13.080 --> 00:24:18.960]   Hagging the a yeah the a10 and now it is very comfortable. Yeah, it's like yeah
[00:24:18.960 --> 00:24:26.600]   Yeah, so that's interesting. Yeah, also the AR effects efforts on other platforms are gonna help out AR kit on on Apple as well
[00:24:26.600 --> 00:24:33.520]   It's it's when people fire up an app and they are expecting some sort of AR help from the app and
[00:24:33.520 --> 00:24:36.040]   it's the when you have a when you have a
[00:24:36.040 --> 00:24:45.040]   Remember remember when it took a little while before the standard way to zoom became pinch and scroll even on a multi touch device
[00:24:45.040 --> 00:24:51.800]   You can see these those one or two like old old style apps where there be a plus and minus button like actually on the phone
[00:24:51.800 --> 00:24:55.680]   And on the device and you're like oh wow. This is like a steam powered app
[00:24:55.680 --> 00:24:59.200]   Why the hell are you wasting my time with this great great grandpa technology?
[00:24:59.200 --> 00:25:06.020]   And it's gonna be like that too when both on both platforms for on both Android and and the and the iPhone
[00:25:06.020 --> 00:25:09.720]   People are going to be expecting why am I I'm using a mapping app?
[00:25:09.720 --> 00:25:11.200]   Why are you not highlighting the building?
[00:25:11.200 --> 00:25:15.280]   I'm looking for or I'm this is a this is supposed to help me install my new stereo
[00:25:15.280 --> 00:25:20.680]   Why are you not highlighting the jack on the back of this amplifier where I'm supposed to plug in my speakers?
[00:25:20.680 --> 00:25:26.440]   This is a waste of my time. Yeah, I'm on my way to work. Why is my turn to source rexeding the car next to me? Yeah, right?
[00:25:26.440 --> 00:25:34.000]   Speeding my car lots more to talk about let's take a little break and I an Aka Renee Richie. We're talking apple
[00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:41.560]   on Mac break weekly our show today brought to you timely in timely fashion by gazelle because you're perhaps thinking I
[00:25:41.560 --> 00:25:46.320]   Like a new iPhone, but how much of a new iPhone can I afford?
[00:25:46.760 --> 00:25:53.380]   Well, you can afford more than you think if you go to gazelle and trade in your old device for cash

[00:27:56.440 --> 00:28:03.820]   Let's continue I like this conversation. I want kind of kind of continue along
[00:28:04.420 --> 00:28:10.420]   This line I do recommend people read the Tim Cook interview. I thought that was very interesting
[00:28:10.420 --> 00:28:14.060]   Eddie Q here it is. That's in the independent
[00:28:14.060 --> 00:28:18.860]   Eddie Q also speaking in an interview with an Indian
[00:28:18.860 --> 00:28:22.320]   publication called live mint he says
[00:28:22.320 --> 00:28:26.500]   People accuse us of not being innovative anymore
[00:28:26.500 --> 00:28:33.180]   The the questioner said Apple historically has a track record of coming out with industry-defining products
[00:28:33.740 --> 00:28:37.020]   But over the past decade there's been a perception that the pace of innovation
[00:28:37.020 --> 00:28:42.860]   Has slowed somewhat. What do you say about that? Eddie's response? No way first of all
[00:28:42.860 --> 00:28:49.980]   The iPhone is 10 years old. That is the last decade the iPad came out after that the watch came after that
[00:28:49.980 --> 00:28:54.300]   So I disagree vehemently with that and I think we've been incredibly innovative
[00:28:54.300 --> 00:28:59.100]   That doesn't even take into account the work that's been done on the Mac iOS and Mac OS from that standpoint
[00:28:59.100 --> 00:29:01.420]   I think where we've led the market
[00:29:02.140 --> 00:29:07.260]   When you think the products products we built over time you own a lot of them and you just assume every year was a new product
[00:29:07.260 --> 00:29:09.260]   But it wasn't you can't do
[00:29:09.260 --> 00:29:14.780]   Revolutionary new products every two months or six months or whatever they take time says Eddie Q
[00:29:14.780 --> 00:29:20.380]   But he should have done you should have just done like this held them up and then dropped them AirPods
[00:29:20.380 --> 00:29:23.260]   And it might drop the AirPods AirPods
[00:29:23.260 --> 00:29:25.740]   last year boom
[00:29:25.980 --> 00:29:33.260]   Apple Apple's problem is that they they're responsible for building everything that runs iOS they're responsible for building everything that runs
[00:29:33.260 --> 00:29:36.860]   Mac OS which means that's really hard for them to compete with
[00:29:36.860 --> 00:29:46.700]   Every company in the world making Android phones and every company in the world making Windows notebooks is hard to it's when you when you got when you got that kind of
[00:29:46.700 --> 00:29:51.900]   manpower human power advantage on the other side it's hard to
[00:29:51.900 --> 00:29:55.020]   Look, I don't think that they're proceeding any less
[00:29:55.900 --> 00:30:02.620]   Any less fast than any other individual company, but when you look at well, what is are they innovating the Mac the way that
[00:30:02.620 --> 00:30:06.380]   Eight different companies are innovating Windows hardware. Well, no
[00:30:06.380 --> 00:30:10.940]   Then that well actually bad example. They don't they clearly don't care about the Mac anymore
[00:30:10.940 --> 00:30:15.740]   But we talk about phones for instance. They can't make one phone that is as
[00:30:15.740 --> 00:30:23.420]   different as eight different new phones that appear over the course of an entire year and even there they're they're really really
[00:30:24.060 --> 00:30:26.940]   Doing very well in that regard in watches
[00:30:26.940 --> 00:30:32.140]   That's it's it took them a couple of years to find the car keys for what they want to do with wearables
[00:30:32.140 --> 00:30:37.180]   But goodness gracious now that they found it. They're sending new land speed records that so much so that google
[00:30:37.180 --> 00:30:40.300]   It's you have those basically stopped
[00:30:40.300 --> 00:30:46.620]   They they have almost they have almost explicitly said that yeah, we're we're in a rebuilding year
[00:30:46.620 --> 00:30:52.220]   We're we're we're basically trading some we're we're trying to get some draft picks in the next in the next round
[00:30:52.700 --> 00:30:55.740]   Uh, yeah, nothing nothing is happening that it's not you can't see
[00:30:55.740 --> 00:30:58.220]   Google wear watches
[00:30:58.220 --> 00:31:03.260]   In the google store they say that it's because that they are changing the store so that it's only like their own
[00:31:03.260 --> 00:31:11.340]   Individual hardware and not third party hardware, but still you can really see that not not one mention really of uh android wear in the google i.o
[00:31:11.340 --> 00:31:13.500]   keynote this year
[00:31:13.500 --> 00:31:18.780]   It's i don't i don't i don't i don't agree that the apple's falling behind an innovation
[00:31:19.420 --> 00:31:26.540]   Again, however, I uh they really need to demonstrate that they care about every all of their product lines and not just the ones that really
[00:31:26.540 --> 00:31:31.180]   Good and commercials and no family phone. Did you guys see the folding phone from zte today? Yeah?
[00:31:31.180 --> 00:31:35.820]   I didn't see zte's although sam's has already said the next note will be a folding phone
[00:31:35.820 --> 00:31:39.740]   This is like two phones side by side and you fold the screens together and put it a little pouch
[00:31:39.740 --> 00:31:42.060]   That's nuts. There's innovation
[00:31:42.060 --> 00:31:46.380]   Just get angry right well. No, it's it well. Okay sam's song
[00:31:46.860 --> 00:31:49.580]   Samsung is one of the companies that is synonymous with gimmickry for me
[00:31:49.580 --> 00:31:51.820]   So but however
[00:31:51.820 --> 00:31:58.220]   Just like the they're the they're a great company to do something stupid like an enormous jumbo sized uh phone
[00:31:58.220 --> 00:32:03.420]   That's almost as big as a tablet and then you realize that oh actually this is incredibly useful
[00:32:03.420 --> 00:32:07.900]   I want to phone that's I wish my i think now the difference in what the axon m is
[00:32:07.900 --> 00:32:10.700]   Which is just basically two phones
[00:32:10.860 --> 00:32:15.580]   Together and what sam's says they're going to do with the next note which is a cuz sam's
[00:32:15.580 --> 00:32:19.260]   Young makes these OLEDs that are flexible and right so that's an intro
[00:32:19.260 --> 00:32:24.700]   I don't know if I'd run to buy one. I want to see how they hear a rumor about a folding apple phone like three four years ago
[00:32:24.700 --> 00:32:28.780]   But it was one of the thousand nose. Yeah, I just want to say in response
[00:32:28.780 --> 00:32:33.820]   Though to you holding up the air pods and say innovate my ass. I would hold up this
[00:32:33.820 --> 00:32:38.540]   This is something that hasn't been invented innovated on in a while. This is a mac mini actually
[00:32:38.540 --> 00:32:41.020]   Is a pretty old mac mini is it the skeleton of a long dead
[00:32:41.020 --> 00:32:44.620]   Yes, it is. Yes, it is
[00:32:44.620 --> 00:32:52.460]   But october 16th yesterday was the third anniversary of the last update for the mac mini
[00:32:52.460 --> 00:32:59.020]   Uh, they're talking about a product that it uh, hasn't been declared dead, but is is barely
[00:32:59.020 --> 00:33:02.380]   That's the frustrating thing if they just said we're no longer making it and took it off the store
[00:33:02.380 --> 00:33:05.740]   We'd be super angry, but we would at least know the biggest device
[00:33:05.740 --> 00:33:08.220]   Yeah, it's when it's like it's not dead, but it's not alive
[00:33:08.220 --> 00:33:11.820]   It's strodingers mac mini that it becomes really untenable like do I buy one?
[00:33:11.820 --> 00:33:15.260]   Do I keep using it? Do I have a faith in this as a platform? I don't know what's happening
[00:33:15.260 --> 00:33:17.260]   Like just it's the worst of all worlds
[00:33:17.260 --> 00:33:23.660]   I think I think that if they were to drop the mac mini that would be a really bad sign for the mac in general
[00:33:23.660 --> 00:33:28.940]   Um, I I would be very very concerned about the entire future of the mac if they were to drop the mac mini
[00:33:28.940 --> 00:33:31.820]   So
[00:33:31.820 --> 00:33:35.820]   Sad is he modular computer? I would love that. It would be well again if they were if they
[00:33:35.820 --> 00:33:41.580]   Mac mini meaning if they were to I said before that if it's a very interesting to me the thought of
[00:33:41.580 --> 00:33:44.300]   Creating something with a form factor of an apple tv
[00:33:44.300 --> 00:33:50.460]   But it runs mac OS even if it was running like a intel like i3 or an i5
[00:33:50.460 --> 00:33:52.620]   CPU instead of something that requires a fan
[00:33:52.620 --> 00:33:57.660]   That would be really interesting to me, but they need to have they need to have a way for someone to buy a
[00:33:58.140 --> 00:34:01.900]   Box that does not have a $800 screen attached to it built into it
[00:34:01.900 --> 00:34:07.260]   So I can simply buy it plug it into whatever monitor I have plug it in my whatever I whatever screen
[00:34:07.260 --> 00:34:11.820]   Excuse me. Uh keyboard and mouse I have the fact that they don't have a mac that costs
[00:34:11.820 --> 00:34:17.660]   Less than the cheapest iMac that's that seems like a viable product means that
[00:34:17.660 --> 00:34:20.540]   It's it's a bet to me. It's a very very bad sign
[00:34:20.540 --> 00:34:24.620]   The thing thing about this is and this is where I think apple gets bit by this
[00:34:24.620 --> 00:34:27.420]   innovation thing
[00:34:27.420 --> 00:34:31.340]   Any pc manufacturer that made this thing would just update it with the latest chit
[00:34:31.340 --> 00:34:34.860]   It's not hard to do update it with the latest chips. You don't have to change the form
[00:34:34.860 --> 00:34:36.700]   You don't have to do a whole lot
[00:34:36.700 --> 00:34:41.820]   There's been you know, you could put these new coffee lake chips in and get amazing speed bumps
[00:34:41.820 --> 00:34:49.260]   With a my with my redesigns. So it's kind of inexcusable. It really is it's a case of ignoring the mini
[00:34:49.260 --> 00:34:52.300]   Because it wouldn't take a lot to update it
[00:34:53.100 --> 00:34:55.980]   Intel has this line that's the classic appears they're called nooks
[00:34:55.980 --> 00:34:57.500]   Uh, nucs
[00:34:57.500 --> 00:35:01.260]   Yes, they're essentially like a little bit bigger than the apple tv
[00:35:01.260 --> 00:35:07.420]   But they are really you can put in whatever CPU you want i3 i5 i7 you can put in whatever memory you want
[00:35:07.420 --> 00:35:12.860]   Uh, it's certainly not it doesn't give you the thousand ports that you might want on a tower machine
[00:35:12.860 --> 00:35:16.940]   But for something that is your little desktop at home that is essentially the
[00:35:16.940 --> 00:35:21.340]   Version of the notebook that you would ordinarily keep plugged into the screen of the keyboard at all times
[00:35:21.340 --> 00:35:26.460]   It's wonderful or as something that you want to keep plugged into the living room tv at home to
[00:35:26.460 --> 00:35:29.260]   Be a media server to
[00:35:29.260 --> 00:35:31.740]   Do be a game machine whatever you want to do with it
[00:35:31.740 --> 00:35:35.500]   It works great and they can get them for less than 500 bucks and they're quite wonderful
[00:35:35.500 --> 00:35:40.620]   If apple just were to say we're gonna we're gonna just flat out steal this idea
[00:35:40.620 --> 00:35:43.740]   And we're gonna make we're just gonna make the case much much cooler
[00:35:43.740 --> 00:35:45.660]   And we're gonna have we're gonna find well
[00:35:45.660 --> 00:35:49.580]   What the hell we'll put face id on it anyway just to make it look at that much book that much cooler
[00:35:50.220 --> 00:35:56.060]   12 south has introduced anything 12 south has already upgraded their new mac smell candle
[00:35:56.060 --> 00:35:58.620]   We've got the
[00:35:58.620 --> 00:36:02.620]   Well, I can't apple upgrade the mini. This is mac candle number two the inspire
[00:36:02.620 --> 00:36:09.660]   It's sort of everyone's greatest strength is also the greatest weakness and apples got this culture where they want like they have this idea for this
[00:36:09.660 --> 00:36:11.900]   Next generation
[00:36:11.900 --> 00:36:12.700]   Yeah, yeah
[00:36:12.700 --> 00:36:16.620]   Absolute stasis they become frozen and instead of we can't do this yet
[00:36:16.780 --> 00:36:21.020]   They don't do anything and it'd be much better if they could figure out some way of just doing what you said
[00:36:21.020 --> 00:36:25.740]   Here's the next generation chip. Here's a few usb c slash thunderbolt three interconnects go crazy
[00:36:25.740 --> 00:36:29.580]   You will have something nice for you in 2008 18. Sorry
[00:36:29.580 --> 00:36:32.460]   We are expecting what in a couple of months a new
[00:36:32.460 --> 00:36:37.500]   iMac pro that's gonna come out in December and then next year mac pro and maybe mac mini
[00:36:37.500 --> 00:36:39.420]   And maybe mac 10
[00:36:39.420 --> 00:36:43.020]   10 p.m. Pacific time on December 31st. We all expecting
[00:36:45.340 --> 00:36:47.340]   They did that with the
[00:36:47.340 --> 00:36:50.220]   Pro right they
[00:36:50.220 --> 00:36:54.060]   You could order it, but you were lucky if you got it by january. Yeah, as long as five people get it
[00:36:54.060 --> 00:36:55.180]   It's kind of going
[00:36:55.180 --> 00:37:00.460]   They're going to open like a pop-up apple store on the very very tail island of the elution island chains
[00:37:00.460 --> 00:37:05.740]   So that they can get down to the last stroke of 2017 to say that well
[00:37:05.740 --> 00:37:11.100]   We've got we've sold three of them two of them to actually have apple employees who flew out just for the thing but
[00:37:11.100 --> 00:37:14.460]   Uh one of them die fix it
[00:37:14.700 --> 00:37:21.820]   apple was asked by a senator al franken to talk about the security and face id i actually was not concerned
[00:37:21.820 --> 00:37:26.780]   I do think it's important to be upfront and i expected a white paper
[00:37:26.780 --> 00:37:29.980]   Uh from apple franken says that he's happy
[00:37:29.980 --> 00:37:33.260]   With the response in particular
[00:37:33.260 --> 00:37:39.340]   Um, not just for consumer privacy, but to protect against racial gender and age bias
[00:37:39.340 --> 00:37:44.620]   The white paper is out by the way leele came out a couple. Oh, it is out. Okay good. Yeah, so that was
[00:37:44.620 --> 00:37:47.980]   White paper really should answer anybody's questions about this, right?
[00:37:47.980 --> 00:37:50.780]   Yeah, it's very it's a good one
[00:37:50.780 --> 00:37:53.740]   Yeah, there aren't even many many pictures on it. It really is
[00:37:53.740 --> 00:37:56.940]   Here's exactly how everything works
[00:37:56.940 --> 00:38:04.380]   Uh, it gives you it gives you other piece of information such as how the dot pattern isn't even consistent from uh phone to phone to phone
[00:38:04.380 --> 00:38:08.460]   So it can actually tell the phone that that projects that dot pattern if it gets
[00:38:08.460 --> 00:38:11.900]   Let's say you were able to feed it the wrong data back
[00:38:12.220 --> 00:38:15.580]   It would be able to say wait, but that's not my dot pattern that someone else is dot pattern
[00:38:15.580 --> 00:38:17.580]   Yeah, it's a real soft replay attack
[00:38:17.580 --> 00:38:21.340]   So this this came this must have come out when i was on vacation because i did i did not give
[00:38:21.340 --> 00:38:24.780]   Yeah, no, but with the scary part of this leo is that they have a new i think we talked about this
[00:38:24.780 --> 00:38:29.820]   They have a neural network that's designed to read your face and a neural network that's designed to fool the neural network
[00:38:29.820 --> 00:38:32.380]   Reading your face to make it's better reading your face
[00:38:32.380 --> 00:38:34.540]   And i don't think they know what these things do anymore
[00:38:34.540 --> 00:38:39.180]   They've just got like this and adversarial relationship that in computer time spans infinity
[00:38:39.660 --> 00:38:42.860]   Where they're fighting with each other like these those forces of dark and light
[00:38:42.860 --> 00:38:46.700]   Uh, and it's just it's it's it's like two pets that are taking care of themselves
[00:38:46.700 --> 00:38:53.420]   It's it really to show how openness is is almost like a marketing feature because these are questions people were having
[00:38:53.420 --> 00:38:58.460]   Uh, one of the things i was wondering about is what they're saying that it sort of learns if you if your
[00:38:58.460 --> 00:39:03.660]   Appearance changes that will figure out that your appearance has changed, but how does that work? Well
[00:39:04.300 --> 00:39:11.580]   If let's say that it does that you are probably already knew that does if you if it fails face id five times
[00:39:11.580 --> 00:39:14.940]   Whatever, uh, it will just say okay. We're turning off face id now
[00:39:14.940 --> 00:39:17.660]   We're gonna have to demand that you plug when you're plugging your passcode
[00:39:17.660 --> 00:39:22.300]   So if you then plug in your passcode and that that and that uh, you plug in the correct one
[00:39:22.300 --> 00:39:27.260]   What happens is the neural net says oh so i guess those five failures were actually correct
[00:39:27.260 --> 00:39:31.420]   I'm going to use those five failures to learn what was different between these
[00:39:31.820 --> 00:39:37.500]   Scans and the ones that I had one file previously. So that's why like if you if i haven't shaved for a couple of days
[00:39:37.500 --> 00:39:41.340]   It might learn that if I change my glasses to a different style of glasses
[00:39:41.340 --> 00:39:46.380]   Uh, if I decide if I buy if I buy a purple cap instead of a yellow cap for instance
[00:39:46.380 --> 00:39:51.020]   Uh, it's supposed to it will gradually figure out what the variations are over time
[00:39:51.020 --> 00:39:55.900]   So it's it's it really does seem like they thought this out very very carefully
[00:39:55.900 --> 00:39:58.780]   They did the non they did the they did the anti-samh song
[00:39:59.260 --> 00:40:05.420]   version of face id which is to assume that people are going to try to fool this and also assume that the system is going to screw up
[00:40:05.420 --> 00:40:07.340]   because the two
[00:40:07.340 --> 00:40:13.340]   Worst ways to do a face id system is one that lets people in without being you and the ones that are such a pain in the butt to use that
[00:40:13.340 --> 00:40:17.260]   You're not even bothered to use it at all. Did I tell you my customs agent story at leo
[00:40:17.260 --> 00:40:22.060]   Not yet. So I was going through customs on my way to the iphone eight
[00:40:22.060 --> 00:40:24.140]   um briefings and
[00:40:24.140 --> 00:40:29.180]   I go through and the guy says why are you here? And I said for the iphone eight launch and he said oh apple is terrible
[00:40:29.660 --> 00:40:32.140]   They're just taking pictures of all our faces
[00:40:32.140 --> 00:40:37.180]   It's going to lead to a massive face databank and cctv scanning and it's an end of privacy
[00:40:37.180 --> 00:40:41.740]   Wow sticking with my passcode because it's unbreakable. Wow you wouldn't think he'd even
[00:40:41.740 --> 00:40:47.340]   He that's really in the nexus line. Okay. So the next is for people not familiar
[00:40:47.340 --> 00:40:53.100]   In order to get to this custom agent right in front of him is either a fingerprint or iris reader
[00:40:53.100 --> 00:40:56.940]   Right that he sees you scan into right before he walked up by the way
[00:40:56.940 --> 00:40:58.940]   There's a way of that in a database
[00:40:59.180 --> 00:41:03.980]   That's why we echo facts that is not merely a secure actually i'm really impressed with what apple's doing
[00:41:03.980 --> 00:41:06.700]   uh with face id
[00:41:06.700 --> 00:41:13.580]   When it unlocks a device and when it doesn't so when a device restarts by the way or you know
[00:41:13.580 --> 00:41:15.420]   You know how sometimes you're asked for the passcode
[00:41:15.420 --> 00:41:19.340]   That means at that point it's thrown away the face id every 48 hours
[00:41:19.340 --> 00:41:24.940]   If it hasn't been unlocked or when you turn the phone off entirely it throws away the keys and regenerates them
[00:41:25.420 --> 00:41:29.500]   To improve unlock performance and keep pace with the natural changes of your face
[00:41:29.500 --> 00:41:38.140]   It augments it's stored mathematical representation over time. I'm reading from the white paper. So what with a successful unlock
[00:41:38.140 --> 00:41:43.980]   It's it may use the newly calculated representation if its quality is sufficient for a
[00:41:43.980 --> 00:41:49.420]   Finite number of additional unlocks before that data is discarded. So now it has a new representation
[00:41:49.420 --> 00:41:52.700]   Uh, it's going to use that but if it fails
[00:41:53.820 --> 00:41:56.300]   But the match quality is higher than a certain threshold
[00:41:56.300 --> 00:41:59.820]   And you immediately follow the failure by entering your passcode
[00:41:59.820 --> 00:42:04.220]   It then says oh, let me take another picture and says okay
[00:42:04.220 --> 00:42:08.940]   I'm going to augment my data with the newly calculated representation. In other words
[00:42:08.940 --> 00:42:12.860]   It learns from failure as well as from success learns from its mistakes
[00:42:12.860 --> 00:42:18.140]   Uh, I mean I I can go on this is quite impressive and uh
[00:42:18.140 --> 00:42:23.760]   There's only one major change between touch id and this and that is that it does keep the original scans of your face
[00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:27.920]   Inside the secure enclave because apple will be updating the neural engine
[00:42:27.920 --> 00:42:33.120]   And if they didn't do that you would have to go through the face scanning every time the neural engine updates
[00:42:33.120 --> 00:42:38.800]   Whereas this they just do a replay of the scan files to update the new neural engine and then go from there
[00:42:38.800 --> 00:42:44.400]   You certainly wouldn't want to redo the the setup procedure, you know a random times that would be kind of annoying
[00:42:44.400 --> 00:42:47.120]   Um
[00:42:47.120 --> 00:42:49.920]   So yeah, good. I'm glad they did release that that's fantastic
[00:42:49.920 --> 00:42:54.960]   What's the story about how it how it avoids being racist? Could you explain explain that?
[00:42:54.960 --> 00:42:57.920]   Yeah, that's probably honestly talked about that at the event
[00:42:57.920 --> 00:43:02.800]   They they went through and they did they did sample scans of a wide variety of people
[00:43:02.800 --> 00:43:07.280]   And they did these were people who were licensed them to do it and agreed for them to do it and were probably compensated
[00:43:07.280 --> 00:43:12.000]   Uh, because I know some people are concerned that there were some initial concern that apple was just using either
[00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:19.040]   Libraries of images or people's own images, but no they actually had a project setup where they brought in people of an incredibly wide different
[00:43:19.360 --> 00:43:27.040]   variety of backgrounds and cultures and areas and geographies and just scanned as many of them from as many angles as possible to start feeding
[00:43:27.040 --> 00:43:29.440]   the neural engine on this database on its uh
[00:43:29.440 --> 00:43:34.400]   chipset so that was one of the things that senator franken was worried about by the way he has
[00:43:34.400 --> 00:43:37.280]   Apparently been satisfied by apple's response
[00:43:37.280 --> 00:43:39.520]   Um
[00:43:39.520 --> 00:43:46.800]   Earlier. I realized this earlier face. Yeah hp and google face recognition systems didn't work with people with darker skin
[00:43:48.080 --> 00:43:52.720]   And yeah, or yeah, well, they produced results that were not um, appropriate. Oh, yeah, google photos
[00:43:52.720 --> 00:43:58.400]   Like in black people to gorillas that's particularly offensive
[00:43:58.400 --> 00:44:02.160]   Um, but so franken was worried a little bit worried about that
[00:44:02.160 --> 00:44:06.880]   He asked he asked about algorithmic bias. What steps did apple take to ensure its system?
[00:44:06.880 --> 00:44:12.240]   It was trained in a diverse set of faces in terms of race gender and age and obviously you just explained that
[00:44:12.240 --> 00:44:16.800]   Uh, and how is apple protecting? They do admit to having problems with very young faces
[00:44:16.800 --> 00:44:22.320]   Like I think it's under the age of 13 because they don't have as many characteristics like as many unique characteristics as older faces
[00:44:22.320 --> 00:44:24.320]   They all look like wits in church hill
[00:44:24.320 --> 00:44:31.520]   That's babies. Um, so this is this is uh, it's you know, I have to uh very impressive
[00:44:31.520 --> 00:44:35.360]   the again though, uh
[00:44:35.360 --> 00:44:41.280]   While you've used it no none of us have lived with it yet and so it will be that will be the ultimate test is whether
[00:44:41.280 --> 00:44:44.560]   It is as easy as effective as fast as touch id
[00:44:45.280 --> 00:44:49.280]   But there are I mean, I forget who said this, but there are uh lots of apple employees
[00:44:49.280 --> 00:44:54.240]   Now you see it all over social media. They went into open carry right after the event and they're all using it and tim cook
[00:44:54.240 --> 00:44:58.640]   And uh, you know, jeff williams and everyone at apple is using it to secure
[00:44:58.640 --> 00:45:05.760]   Data that is highly important and highly sensitive on their phones. So that's a good show of faith in the system
[00:45:05.760 --> 00:45:09.760]   Well, of course one person who is using the uh, iphone 10 is tim cook
[00:45:10.240 --> 00:45:16.720]   He was speaking at oxford and it it just slid right out of his pocket proving that in fact the glass back is slippery
[00:45:16.720 --> 00:45:21.280]   He uh, he just flipped he looked at a notification notice flipped it over
[00:45:21.280 --> 00:45:26.560]   So just I don't know if he was wearing particularly slippery slacks
[00:45:26.560 --> 00:45:34.400]   It fell out and made him pull his uh, socks down. I don't know what that he can know. He did he did like the lower pakart maneuver
[00:45:34.400 --> 00:45:39.280]   Is that what that's called the lower pakart? Okay?
[00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:44.000]   Well, no the the upper the the the the the the car maneuver is so okay. It's the lower
[00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:48.720]   The lower you sit down the sit down the captain's chair. The first thing you do is in a dignified way
[00:45:48.720 --> 00:45:54.560]   Tight prevent your prevent your upper tuner from blousing out by pulling it down. Yes. You want a little tight tunic
[00:45:54.560 --> 00:45:59.760]   It's funny that his hot pooter tim cook a lot now like there was another picture of him wearing a gold apple watch with a hermez
[00:45:59.760 --> 00:46:02.400]   Oh lord apple watch band
[00:46:02.400 --> 00:46:05.200]   He's got he's got to realize that he's you know, he's open to this now. Yeah
[00:46:05.200 --> 00:46:07.920]   Yeah, it's pretty it's pretty funny
[00:46:08.320 --> 00:46:10.320]   um, let's see
[00:46:10.320 --> 00:46:17.680]   I'm gonna I'm saving crack for last. So as any anybody would you know, but that's a security thing folks leo
[00:46:17.680 --> 00:46:21.520]   A little later on will address crack
[00:46:21.520 --> 00:46:26.960]   Uh, I want to get all of the other stories out of the way though before we delve into that apple
[00:46:26.960 --> 00:46:32.960]   Apparently was having talks to buy a health company crossover health
[00:46:32.960 --> 00:46:37.360]   Uh, those talks are now over without a deal
[00:46:38.160 --> 00:46:39.680]   Um
[00:46:39.680 --> 00:46:43.760]   It's a venture backed startup that runs onsite medical clinics
[00:46:43.760 --> 00:46:47.680]   So the question of megan brought this up in ios today is
[00:46:47.680 --> 00:46:52.640]   apple thinking about building and running onsite medical clinics
[00:46:52.640 --> 00:46:57.600]   I don't know. What do you think? Why what were they looking at across over health?
[00:46:57.600 --> 00:47:02.480]   Why would apple want to get into primary care? That sounds like a recipe for disaster
[00:47:03.360 --> 00:47:06.480]   Well, it it puts them into a network of local providers
[00:47:06.480 --> 00:47:10.160]   So if it were simply a way to direct people towards
[00:47:10.160 --> 00:47:16.160]   We have now telling the user we have now reached the limits of what I can help you with being an inanimate object
[00:47:16.160 --> 00:47:21.680]   Please go to i've i've set you up a medical genius bar appointment at this address right here
[00:47:21.680 --> 00:47:23.680]   um
[00:47:23.680 --> 00:47:29.120]   It could just i mean it's there's a lot there's a lot to be said for simply having a network of local
[00:47:29.600 --> 00:47:33.680]   Things local places for data. So yeah, yeah, well for for data
[00:47:33.680 --> 00:47:37.360]   But also if you if your ambitions are to go beyond uh, uh,
[00:47:37.360 --> 00:47:39.360]   Or are to go beyond uh,
[00:47:39.360 --> 00:47:43.760]   Simply being a gadget that tells you what your heart rate is
[00:47:43.760 --> 00:47:48.800]   I mean if they could do a version of the apple store only for health
[00:47:48.800 --> 00:47:56.240]   So that this all these all these uh, care locations are still good people who are existing customers would still be existing customers
[00:47:56.480 --> 00:48:05.280]   They would see no change in care. But if you have an iphone if you have an apple watch that device could then interact with your your real
[00:48:05.280 --> 00:48:07.040]   uh
[00:48:07.040 --> 00:48:10.880]   Real world care in a much more intimate way because they can build the entire
[00:48:10.880 --> 00:48:18.160]   Uh legal infrastructure for how to contain this information how to deploy this information how to share this information between locations
[00:48:18.160 --> 00:48:22.960]   So again, if they were it depends on how big their ambitions are right this could be it could be
[00:48:23.920 --> 00:48:28.800]   Remember we keep have to go back to the idea of how silly it seemed that they would have an apple store in every single mall
[00:48:28.800 --> 00:48:32.560]   If it does seem kind of silly that they would get into health care
[00:48:32.560 --> 00:48:38.960]   Not you wouldn't but if you think of it less as a apple store for health on the marquee and more of a oh by the way
[00:48:38.960 --> 00:48:41.040]   Here is a here is a way that we can
[00:48:41.040 --> 00:48:44.640]   Test out a larger more ambitious health program
[00:48:44.640 --> 00:48:51.120]   Uh without having to again own doctors or own medical people just simply say here is how we would build a
[00:48:51.440 --> 00:48:58.160]   Digital health care system if we had the opportunity to do so and then you could then use that example to sell it to larger health care organizations
[00:48:58.160 --> 00:49:03.600]   Once you have data seeing here's how it affected patient health care here's how it affected cost of treatment
[00:49:03.600 --> 00:49:07.760]   Then that's an interesting way to do it particularly if you have 230 billion dollars sitting around
[00:49:07.760 --> 00:49:14.160]   Well, but they didn't acquire them. So it shows what they were thinking but doesn't show what they actually are planning
[00:49:14.160 --> 00:49:20.800]   They also by the way are working with the fda to fast to create ways to fast track digital health software
[00:49:21.280 --> 00:49:22.800]   uh through their approval process
[00:49:22.800 --> 00:49:25.840]   This one thing holding apple back is fda approval is hard to get
[00:49:25.840 --> 00:49:29.920]   And uh to date nothing that apple does has fda approval am I right?
[00:49:29.920 --> 00:49:35.040]   There are devices for the apple watch an apple phone, but not made by apple
[00:49:35.040 --> 00:49:38.720]   And they commented before that you know jeff williams runs watch at apple
[00:49:38.720 --> 00:49:46.080]   But he technically runs health and health is going to be a wide much bigger range of products and services than watch one day
[00:49:46.080 --> 00:49:51.200]   And one of the reasons for that for that decoupling is that they could make devices that would have to go through fda
[00:49:51.200 --> 00:49:54.880]   approval that might be too long for a process for consumer wearables
[00:49:54.880 --> 00:49:59.200]   But there might be a version of apple watch that is far more tuned to health than the current version
[00:49:59.200 --> 00:50:03.600]   And maybe it takes a little longer to come to market, but it'll be specifically for people who need that product
[00:50:03.600 --> 00:50:08.240]   Uh, and it sounds like if apple is exploring this it could it could be apple retail for health
[00:50:08.240 --> 00:50:11.840]   Which would give them a huge footprint at least in the united states to begin with
[00:50:11.840 --> 00:50:15.200]   But it also could be a place for apple to do research kit and care kit
[00:50:15.200 --> 00:50:20.720]   And to have products on the shelves and do you know to interface with customers around primary caregivers
[00:50:20.720 --> 00:50:25.520]   You know, it's sort of just to have feet on the pavement, you know everywhere that because health
[00:50:25.520 --> 00:50:30.400]   Tim pug has commented several times that health is a hugely important and hugely valuable business for apple
[00:50:30.400 --> 00:50:37.360]   Well potentially very very valuable if they came up with something like a non-invasive glucose blood glucose meter. Yeah
[00:50:37.360 --> 00:50:42.240]   Yeah, I mean particularly in the united states where it's not it's not the government
[00:50:42.240 --> 00:50:45.680]   Deciding how much people are going to be paid for certain health services
[00:50:45.680 --> 00:50:47.040]   Uh, there's a lot of money in it
[00:50:47.040 --> 00:50:51.600]   Which means there could be a lot of money in providing those services to people who make money off these things
[00:50:51.600 --> 00:50:55.040]   But imagine how interesting it would be to have a stock apple
[00:50:55.040 --> 00:50:59.280]   They would still have a stock apple watch, but there is software you can get access to
[00:50:59.280 --> 00:51:05.360]   Uh through, uh, you can get if you they can get access to via prescription if that makes sense
[00:51:05.360 --> 00:51:08.880]   Where there's a version of the health apples. There's a health apple store
[00:51:08.880 --> 00:51:14.560]   That once your primary caregiver has given you access authorized access to a specific app
[00:51:14.800 --> 00:51:16.960]   You can then download this app that will
[00:51:16.960 --> 00:51:22.240]   That will, uh, give you specific health advice based on your
[00:51:22.240 --> 00:51:27.440]   Heart rate readings that will as soon every time that your watch comes near
[00:51:27.440 --> 00:51:32.000]   Your wifi base station will send this information directly to your doctor particularly
[00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:35.920]   Giving him alerts as to here's an anomaly that we need to keep a keep an eye on
[00:51:35.920 --> 00:51:39.760]   Uh, it is a big deal to get certification even just for an experimental
[00:51:40.400 --> 00:51:45.200]   Technology something where you're saying we want to do a study with 1000 people here the 1000 case studies
[00:51:45.200 --> 00:51:48.560]   We want to do here's the risk that's going to happen to these people by
[00:51:48.560 --> 00:51:54.160]   Participating in the study and here are the benefits that's an enormous amount of money an enormous amount of bureaucracy
[00:51:54.160 --> 00:51:58.240]   They basically have to set up an entire health care company within apple just to run those studies
[00:51:58.240 --> 00:52:03.120]   I have I have family members that work in those industries where they work on developing technologies and
[00:52:03.120 --> 00:52:06.640]   I'm quite familiar with what they have to do to just to get an
[00:52:06.960 --> 00:52:10.560]   Simple experimental study done. So yeah, if that's if that's part of their ambition
[00:52:10.560 --> 00:52:13.200]   Uh, that's good. They're they're gonna have a
[00:52:13.200 --> 00:52:17.200]   Tough hill to climb and they're they seem determined to go try to climb it
[00:52:17.200 --> 00:52:20.400]   Steve jobs very famously with the uh
[00:52:20.400 --> 00:52:23.760]   introduction of the iphone said no one wants
[00:52:23.760 --> 00:52:27.600]   A stylus you see a stylus. Yeah, blue it
[00:52:27.600 --> 00:52:32.080]   We don't want to carry around a mouse, right? So what are we gonna do?
[00:52:32.080 --> 00:52:35.680]   Oh a stylus, right? We're gonna use a stylus
[00:52:36.800 --> 00:52:38.800]   No
[00:52:38.800 --> 00:52:41.280]   Who wants a stylus
[00:52:41.280 --> 00:52:44.480]   You have to get them and put them away and you lose them yuck
[00:52:44.480 --> 00:52:47.120]   Yuck
[00:52:47.120 --> 00:52:53.360]   Well, then it's like he's like he's demonstrating like a like a demonstrating like a kitchen appliance like who wants to mess with
[00:52:53.360 --> 00:52:56.160]   Both the floor cleaner and a sweeper
[00:52:56.160 --> 00:53:00.320]   But wait just two more there's no question the pencil is a is a
[00:53:00.320 --> 00:53:05.920]   Success although I suspect kind of a limited market is certain people use the pencil
[00:53:06.400 --> 00:53:12.000]   rumor, uh, is that apple according to the korean herald, which I don't know if this is a
[00:53:12.000 --> 00:53:14.240]   very valuable
[00:53:14.240 --> 00:53:21.120]   rumor source for apple stuff claims the apple engineers have been working on a new iphone device that comes with a digital pen for launch
[00:53:21.120 --> 00:53:23.680]   in 2019
[00:53:23.680 --> 00:53:25.600]   credible
[00:53:25.600 --> 00:53:27.600]   I mean, um, it's
[00:53:27.600 --> 00:53:33.360]   You like my understanding you use it. Oh, I love the pencil my understanding is that the i like out when apple was making the pencil
[00:53:33.520 --> 00:53:37.760]   They they could have made it work with the iphone year one if they wanted to I mean tim cook famously said
[00:53:37.760 --> 00:53:40.480]   Pencil is great with iphone and ipad and people picked up with that
[00:53:40.480 --> 00:53:43.360]   Because he likely has an iphone in his lab that does exactly that
[00:53:43.360 --> 00:53:45.440]   It's a question of are they gonna release it?
[00:53:45.440 --> 00:53:49.520]   The only thing for me is that that pencil looks really big next to an iphone
[00:53:49.520 --> 00:53:54.240]   And I don't want a tiny pencil because I like an art class through the last kit to get to the desk
[00:53:54.240 --> 00:53:57.200]   Can you get the tiny broken pencil and you're like, ah, I hate to draw with it
[00:53:57.200 --> 00:53:59.200]   So I don't want a tiny little stylus
[00:53:59.280 --> 00:54:03.680]   But I think there might be some middle ground for an apple pencil too that would better suit both the iphone
[00:54:03.680 --> 00:54:07.360]   I'd love it though. I mean my favorite thing about the galaxy note is that it's a small
[00:54:07.360 --> 00:54:12.080]   Little wacom tablet that I can hold in my hand and sketch on and I'd love that ability on an iphone
[00:54:12.080 --> 00:54:15.200]   Copy 386 is pointing out quite rightly that jobs
[00:54:15.200 --> 00:54:20.000]   Was arguing against the stylus being mandatory like that's how you have to use the device
[00:54:20.000 --> 00:54:24.240]   Steve he believes that nobody wanted video on there. Well, he didn't really he said nobody wanted video on there
[00:54:24.240 --> 00:54:27.840]   I had apple was not gonna sit on their ipad apple was never gonna make a phone
[00:54:28.080 --> 00:54:33.920]   They were never gonna make a tiny town. He might not he might not might fought against a stylus as an adjunct that the os is completely
[00:54:33.920 --> 00:54:35.920]   Touch completely functional with touch
[00:54:35.920 --> 00:54:40.400]   But it's nice to have sometimes a pointy thing that you can draw with or write on that same interview with
[00:54:40.400 --> 00:54:43.760]   Tim cook where he said that's do I think this thing he said Steve would change his mind famously
[00:54:43.760 --> 00:54:47.520]   He'd have a completely solid like never gonna do that right that someone give a compelling argument
[00:54:47.520 --> 00:54:51.280]   Then he'd act like he was never again. I was always in favor of styluses
[00:54:51.280 --> 00:54:54.800]   Small tab was there great at he shipped that a week a week later
[00:54:54.800 --> 00:54:58.960]   He'd be singing that he is going to let you down. He is going to take part and
[00:54:58.960 --> 00:55:07.440]   Right, yeah, have you just reverse Rick rolled as I think exactly there's a no I
[00:55:07.440 --> 00:55:11.200]   I think there's a given how old the apple pencil is at this point
[00:55:11.200 --> 00:55:16.880]   There's certainly a lot of room to do an apple pencil too that is perhaps the size of a regular pencil
[00:55:16.880 --> 00:55:22.160]   And so once you start to make it something that you could stick in a shirt pocket without
[00:55:22.960 --> 00:55:30.240]   Two of that third of it sticking out from the top once you master this amazing technology such as the cap that goes over the tip
[00:55:30.240 --> 00:55:34.480]   Again, I know that they've got at least at least three radians of the entire
[00:55:34.480 --> 00:55:39.600]   Ratio camp is now focused on trying to develop technology to have a cap that would put over the
[00:55:39.600 --> 00:55:43.520]   Point of the pencil explosions and then people
[00:55:43.520 --> 00:55:47.920]   Bodies being pulled out and covered up because they don't want to know that that's happening
[00:55:47.920 --> 00:55:51.360]   I mean if they if they made it like a more of the size of a regular pen
[00:55:51.680 --> 00:55:56.320]   It's not a deal breaker to simply say here is a really really nice pen that you will stick in your pocket
[00:55:56.320 --> 00:55:59.600]   No, it will not go inside a hole inside the inside the pencil
[00:55:59.600 --> 00:56:02.800]   No, it will not be mandatory to have it inside a charging case
[00:56:02.800 --> 00:56:07.200]   So it's on a loop like a like a like a little notebook on the side of the
[00:56:07.200 --> 00:56:13.120]   People carry around pens all the time. They will be happy to carry around this beautiful looking $100
[00:56:13.120 --> 00:56:20.800]   Or probably $130 pencil alongside it particularly once it starts to justify the expense of your thousand dollar
[00:56:20.960 --> 00:56:22.320]   iPhone 10
[00:56:22.320 --> 00:56:26.240]   I am I'm like Renee. I'm a huge fan of the of the galaxy note
[00:56:26.240 --> 00:56:29.440]   It's i'll be how have it for a month and then i'll
[00:56:29.440 --> 00:56:32.560]   Forget it exists for the first week, but then as soon as I'm reminded
[00:56:32.560 --> 00:56:37.040]   One day suddenly it's like now it's the day i have to pack it up and send it back
[00:56:37.040 --> 00:56:42.960]   Oh, but I I want to be able to like take quick notes on the screen without having to even unlock it and oh
[00:56:42.960 --> 00:56:45.680]   Oh, why can't my phone do that?
[00:56:45.680 --> 00:56:46.400]   Don't worry
[00:56:46.400 --> 00:56:52.400]   Then there'll be another phone although that's that is the nice thing about the notice really the only major phone with a stylus
[00:56:52.400 --> 00:56:55.200]   Yeah for now
[00:56:55.200 --> 00:56:59.840]   Uh just in magic leap has announced it has achieved its half billion dollar
[00:56:59.840 --> 00:57:05.280]   Dear series d funding round so more money pouring into
[00:57:05.280 --> 00:57:08.880]   magic leap an ar technology that
[00:57:08.880 --> 00:57:15.360]   Apparently is amazing, but no one has seen and those who have don't talk and
[00:57:16.240 --> 00:57:21.920]   I just I don't know if there's any to say about magic leap except that they keep getting more money
[00:57:21.920 --> 00:57:26.800]   Yeah, it's my my understanding is it's uh, it's a hell of a demo
[00:57:26.800 --> 00:57:34.320]   Yeah, I mean if you if you get the demo you will walk out sort of kind of shaking and vibrating on how good it was
[00:57:34.320 --> 00:57:41.040]   But it's my again. My understanding is that it's not the the ideal will be oh see this little bar
[00:57:41.600 --> 00:57:44.880]   Metal bar that's in here. Well, that's the entire projection system right now
[00:57:44.880 --> 00:57:51.600]   It's more like here is these thick wad of cables that go to the table full of machinery that makes it work right now
[00:57:51.600 --> 00:57:57.200]   Uh and that obviously the biggest deal is to try to figure out how to wait to make it so that you can actually walk around with it
[00:57:57.200 --> 00:58:05.760]   Uh, but yeah, every I have spoken to somebody who has tried it firsthand and that's how she described it
[00:58:05.760 --> 00:58:07.760]   Yeah, you just walk away
[00:58:07.760 --> 00:58:10.400]   You just walk away saying I want I want
[00:58:10.880 --> 00:58:15.840]   Must she uh she makes she makes it she makes it feel like she's just tried heroin for the first time
[00:58:15.840 --> 00:58:19.200]   And just all I want is to try it again. Yeah, yeah
[00:58:19.200 --> 00:58:25.120]   Well, I wish him luck. They've got plenty of money. That's for sure. Go. Yeah, you don't need profits
[00:58:25.120 --> 00:58:29.600]   You just need more and you just need stockholders that want in that's really all you need. Yeah
[00:58:29.600 --> 00:58:32.320]   Ask twitter. Yeah
[00:58:32.320 --> 00:58:37.120]   Uh a couple of court cases china has gone to court seeking a ban
[00:58:37.200 --> 00:58:42.240]   I'm sorry qualcom has gone to court seeking a ban in china for apple iphones
[00:58:42.240 --> 00:58:46.800]   Expanding the world's most vicious contract negotiations
[00:58:46.800 --> 00:58:49.680]   into into china now
[00:58:49.680 --> 00:58:54.240]   Um, we've talked infinitely about this uh about this story
[00:58:54.240 --> 00:58:58.640]   Did you see them trolling apple get last night on their hanqang? Uh, five g
[00:58:58.640 --> 00:59:04.240]   Presentation no what they say they had a slide up saying five g coming soon to these android phones
[00:59:04.240 --> 00:59:09.440]   Oh, yeah, we'd only hear something. Well, they actually we have ads for them and they are a sponsor of some of our shows
[00:59:09.440 --> 00:59:12.000]   So I think we've had ads on this show
[00:59:12.000 --> 00:59:12.800]   Uh
[00:59:12.800 --> 00:59:19.200]   touting their uh gigabit lte chip which is only on android apple uses you know apple won't use it so
[00:59:19.200 --> 00:59:21.920]   Um, if you're gonna, you know go that way
[00:59:21.920 --> 00:59:25.840]   Yeah apple is is not what's the right word apple takes
[00:59:25.840 --> 00:59:31.520]   Uh the radio slowly there usually like it took them a while to get lte after the
[00:59:31.920 --> 00:59:36.000]   HTC thunderbolt came out and if they you know they're they seem to stay they're conservative
[00:59:36.000 --> 00:59:39.360]   I mean that's a good word they seem to stay a step behind when it comes to radios
[00:59:39.360 --> 00:59:43.680]   So I have nothing to say about this suit only because it I don't really
[00:59:43.680 --> 00:59:49.920]   Know we talked about it on sunday and the consensus seemed to be it's just it's all just a very bitter
[00:59:49.920 --> 00:59:55.840]   Contracting negotiation that will be as lawyers. It's companies trading money so lawyers can get cars. Yeah nice
[00:59:55.840 --> 00:59:58.400]   Glad those lawyers are driving those nice
[00:59:58.960 --> 01:00:03.520]   Cars apple did lose in court in east texas
[01:00:03.520 --> 01:00:09.600]   Where it's not hard to lose in court if you're a big a big company the vernet x patent case
[01:00:09.600 --> 01:00:12.400]   Is over apple will have to pay
[01:00:12.400 --> 01:00:14.800]   440 million dollars
[01:00:14.800 --> 01:00:21.680]   Uh, this is I think the third or fourth decision. I believe they're appealing it again anyway. Oh no really wow
[01:00:21.680 --> 01:00:23.440]   Wow
[01:00:23.440 --> 01:00:25.360]   Well, this goes to vpn and to face time
[01:00:25.360 --> 01:00:29.680]   It's one of like when people wonder what's happening with face time is that apple had to rearchitect it following this
[01:00:29.680 --> 01:00:34.560]   Pat once I believe was for fax machines or something equally ludicrous the ironically is all four
[01:00:34.560 --> 01:00:40.800]   Of the vernet patent vernet x patents have been invalidated by the patent trademark office
[01:00:40.800 --> 01:00:47.680]   But they still can sue because the validations not legally binding until all appeals have been exhausted. So it's one of those
[01:00:47.680 --> 01:00:54.560]   I don't know. I just I thought we were going to see many more cases patent troll cases in east texas
[01:00:54.640 --> 01:00:55.840]   but
[01:00:55.840 --> 01:00:57.680]   uh, they continue
[01:00:57.680 --> 01:01:01.520]   And uh, it's going against apple. It's gone against apple all along in this one
[01:01:01.520 --> 01:01:07.040]   one of the reasons I'm told that patent trolls like the us district court for the eastern texas is
[01:01:07.040 --> 01:01:12.640]   uh, the judge there and the juries there are very much
[01:01:12.640 --> 01:01:15.600]   in favor of the little guy against big business
[01:01:15.600 --> 01:01:17.280]   so
[01:01:17.280 --> 01:01:24.080]   Uh, we'll see because the supreme court recently ruled that uh patent suits can only be brought now in districts where the company is based
[01:01:24.560 --> 01:01:26.560]   So I think it's kind of the beginning of the end
[01:01:26.560 --> 01:01:29.680]   for the district court in east texas
[01:01:29.680 --> 01:01:35.280]   Steve wozniak has a new project was you
[01:01:35.280 --> 01:01:39.920]   Not clear how much steve is involved in this
[01:01:39.920 --> 01:01:46.080]   It's an online learning platform focused on both students and companies that will eventually hire those students
[01:01:46.080 --> 01:01:48.960]   wazu based in arizona
[01:01:48.960 --> 01:01:52.960]   And they hope to launch physical locations in more than 30 cities around the globe
[01:01:53.760 --> 01:01:59.600]   Uh, woz in a prepared statement, which means probably somebody wrote it for him and ran it by him for approval
[01:01:59.600 --> 01:02:04.160]   Our goal is to educate and train people in employable digital skills without putting them in the years of debt
[01:02:04.160 --> 01:02:08.160]   People are often afraid to choose a technology based career because they think they can't do it
[01:02:08.160 --> 01:02:11.440]   I know they can and I want to show them how my entire life
[01:02:11.440 --> 01:02:14.160]   I've worked to build develop and create a better world through technology
[01:02:14.160 --> 01:02:18.880]   And i've always respected education now is the time for wozu and we're only getting started
[01:02:18.880 --> 01:02:25.120]   It is true that steve went back to college and got his teaching credential and taught high school for some time after
[01:02:25.120 --> 01:02:30.640]   He left apple yep, so the best equipped class rooms
[01:02:30.640 --> 01:02:39.520]   The entire country you can get the wozu app now on ios by coder for rent llc
[01:02:39.520 --> 01:02:43.840]   Uh, I don't know exactly what it does
[01:02:43.840 --> 01:02:47.360]   I'm always nervous about this kind of thing because
[01:02:47.680 --> 01:02:49.280]   Uh
[01:02:49.280 --> 01:02:51.040]   Well, we've seen a lot of these
[01:02:51.040 --> 01:02:54.320]   Schools kind of turned out to be somewhat scammy on the other hand moocs
[01:02:54.320 --> 01:02:57.200]   Like uh, you demi are just doing great
[01:02:57.200 --> 01:03:00.800]   So i'm not sure
[01:03:00.800 --> 01:03:02.000]   Not sure
[01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:04.000]   I'd have to i mean i don't talk to woz
[01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:08.240]   Exactly. I don't know anything more about this than what I do what I read in the release
[01:03:08.240 --> 01:03:10.720]   But it's an it's an interesting
[01:03:10.720 --> 01:03:14.400]   It would be interesting time to do something like that in a positive way
[01:03:14.880 --> 01:03:21.120]   Given that there's so many companies that are kind of scamming you know for profit organizations that are scamming really scamming people into
[01:03:21.120 --> 01:03:24.800]   Uh education that is absolutely of no use to anybody
[01:03:24.800 --> 01:03:28.720]   And just leaving them heavily in debt. They're really just you know federal loan mills
[01:03:28.720 --> 01:03:30.720]   That's really about it
[01:03:30.720 --> 01:03:37.040]   But if you were to given that technology is one of those areas where they don't care so much about
[01:03:37.040 --> 01:03:41.520]   The college degrees so much as the experience that you can bring to the job
[01:03:41.920 --> 01:03:45.600]   It's almost like being an artist. You show me what you've done and that's well
[01:03:45.600 --> 01:03:51.600]   Doesn't make me decide to hire you or not. It's a good opportunity to say we're not we're not in accreditation school
[01:03:51.600 --> 01:03:53.840]   We are just going to give you the skills and then
[01:03:53.840 --> 01:03:57.840]   Feed you into a job. We can get the experience to get the next job
[01:03:57.840 --> 01:04:00.320]   So if again, I don't know anything about this
[01:04:00.320 --> 01:04:04.960]   I I'd like to learn more about it and I would certainly hope that he wouldn't attach his name to something that wasn't
[01:04:04.960 --> 01:04:07.040]   Uh joyful and positive
[01:04:07.040 --> 01:04:09.040]   absolutely, although
[01:04:09.520 --> 01:04:13.360]   We know was has a hard time saying no sometimes too. So I don't
[01:04:13.360 --> 01:04:18.000]   That's that's the problem is I I just don't know how tightly integrated he is uh with this
[01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:24.080]   Well, here's his video. Amen. I maybe maybe he is here's here's uh, Steve was niac. I just downloaded the uh
[01:04:24.080 --> 01:04:26.720]   Was you app? Let me turn up the uh
[01:04:26.720 --> 01:04:29.440]   the sound here
[01:04:29.440 --> 01:04:31.600]   And uh see what Steve has to say here
[01:04:31.600 --> 01:04:34.320]   This is Steve
[01:04:34.320 --> 01:04:41.120]   Personally congratulate you for taking the first step to finding out what career path in the high tech world is best for you
[01:04:41.120 --> 01:04:43.680]   See you on the other side
[01:04:43.680 --> 01:04:49.680]   See he thought he thought talking about you know learn gun repair
[01:04:49.680 --> 01:04:52.640]   relation and cooling
[01:04:52.640 --> 01:04:56.160]   All right, I'm gonna I'm gonna take the assessment test here real quickly
[01:04:56.160 --> 01:05:00.160]   Just to see if I am an apple pencil if I am ready
[01:05:00.160 --> 01:05:02.080]   Yeah, exactly
[01:05:02.080 --> 01:05:04.080]   You applying Leo. I'm applying I need some
[01:05:04.080 --> 01:05:06.960]   Professor you should be a
[01:05:06.960 --> 01:05:08.960]   Anything about this crap
[01:05:08.960 --> 01:05:14.720]   Are you gonna learn how to punch basic out on a paper card and make it run right the first that I can do
[01:05:14.720 --> 01:05:20.080]   That I have a lot to make international long distance phone calls for just pennies
[01:05:20.080 --> 01:05:25.520]   It is an iPhone. Oh, yeah, they're
[01:05:25.520 --> 01:05:30.800]   I do like the fact there's so many places where you can get a basic tech education for
[01:05:31.280 --> 01:05:36.240]   Nothing or next to nothing. Yeah. Yeah. I mean it's it's it's if you really I mean honestly
[01:05:36.240 --> 01:05:37.600]   uh
[01:05:37.600 --> 01:05:39.920]   the number of people that I've talked to that says that
[01:05:39.920 --> 01:05:43.600]   In many places the definition of a great
[01:05:43.600 --> 01:05:51.040]   Great programmer is the ability to the knowledge of the url stack overflow.com and the ability to cut and paste
[01:05:51.040 --> 01:05:55.120]   Oh by the way, that has now turned out to be a real problem because a lot of that
[01:05:55.600 --> 01:06:02.000]   Code I just saw an assessment that a lot of that a lot of the best answers are the highest ranked answers have terrible code
[01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:06.720]   And it's propagating a whole generation of really bad security flaws
[01:06:06.720 --> 01:06:12.000]   All right. I'm ready for the assessment. Shall we take the assessment? You can help me with this start assessment
[01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:17.040]   How long have you been coding? I think I think the app is going to be really impressed that you were tied to the interview
[01:06:17.040 --> 01:06:23.120]   Not every not in all these like younger people understand the serious about the job you want to have so I've been coding as a hobby
[01:06:24.160 --> 01:06:27.680]   45 divided by nine equals 12 minus what
[01:06:27.680 --> 01:06:31.040]   Seven okay, I think I know that one all right
[01:06:31.040 --> 01:06:39.840]   So what mathematical symbol can be between put between five and nine to get a number bigger than five and smaller than nine?
[01:06:39.840 --> 01:06:42.640]   Well, that would be
[01:06:42.640 --> 01:06:46.080]   What to get a number bigger than plus
[01:06:46.080 --> 01:06:51.600]   No, no bigger than five but smaller than nine oh smaller than nine
[01:06:52.400 --> 01:06:56.080]   Uh five point nine. How about that? Wow, that was tricky
[01:06:56.080 --> 01:07:02.800]   Data structures like a binary tree and linked list are built using composition
[01:07:02.800 --> 01:07:07.200]   Okay, I don't know. I'm guessing that one one gigabyte is equal to
[01:07:07.200 --> 01:07:11.920]   Two to the 30 bits two to the 30 bytes
[01:07:11.920 --> 01:07:19.680]   Wow, this is a hard one. Andy come on. Tell me out here to the 20 bits. I feel like it's two to the 20 bits
[01:07:21.120 --> 01:07:23.120]   I don't know
[01:07:23.120 --> 01:07:25.840]   30 to the 30 bits
[01:07:25.840 --> 01:07:35.600]   Okay, I'm gonna go I'm gonna our studio audience agrees if new york can be encrypted as pgy
[01:07:35.600 --> 01:07:38.400]   qtm
[01:07:38.400 --> 01:07:43.760]   How can you code the world word charlotte? Well, I need pencil and paper for this, but it's a simple cipher obviously
[01:07:43.760 --> 01:07:46.400]   Uh, let's see
[01:07:46.400 --> 01:07:48.720]   I don't want to write this all down. No, they're all
[01:07:49.760 --> 01:07:51.760]   CD E
[01:07:51.760 --> 01:07:55.360]   C
[01:07:55.360 --> 01:07:59.120]   You're good, Andy you're good
[01:07:59.120 --> 01:08:00.480]   Oh
[01:08:00.480 --> 01:08:05.200]   T was enough. What about recursion is true in comparison with iteration
[01:08:05.200 --> 01:08:11.200]   It occurs two works that have never been in my kitchen
[01:08:11.200 --> 01:08:13.680]   Is that right?
[01:08:13.680 --> 01:08:18.400]   Yeah, right it incurs a function call every recursive program can beat man. Yeah, I'm gonna say yeah
[01:08:18.800 --> 01:08:20.800]   36 11 18
[01:08:20.800 --> 01:08:23.680]   What is the sixth term in the sequence?
[01:08:23.680 --> 01:08:27.120]   5 7 3 5 7 9
[01:08:27.120 --> 01:08:29.600]   27
[01:08:29.600 --> 01:08:32.080]   I'm gonna get 100 because good lord
[01:08:32.080 --> 01:08:37.840]   There's more in the final stretch of a marathon you quickly ran by the person in second place. What place are you in?
[01:08:37.840 --> 01:08:44.320]   Oh second I ran by oh because i'm now second
[01:08:44.960 --> 01:08:52.640]   Thank you if friend is coded as hum j tk, how is candle written using the code? How did you do that so fast? Andy?
[01:08:52.640 --> 01:09:01.200]   Uh, they're all two letters off. This one I think the first is two off the second is three off the third is I
[01:09:01.200 --> 01:09:05.520]   Yeah, you increase the index one. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's a good way to do it
[01:09:05.520 --> 01:09:08.880]   I was gonna ran out the whole damn alphabet, but that's a lot that lot faster
[01:09:08.960 --> 01:09:15.920]   See I scared my school system because I was I don't know if I have a high IQ, but I was really really good at puzzles
[01:09:15.920 --> 01:09:20.880]   I would scare I would do scare so candle would be CD F right
[01:09:20.880 --> 01:09:24.080]   Oh, no, I guess e see de
[01:09:24.080 --> 01:09:29.360]   My friend is h fgh. Oh, yeah, ours. Oh no, this is our
[01:09:29.360 --> 01:09:33.200]   Rst you I is I jk
[01:09:33.200 --> 01:09:38.240]   There'd be skill testing question. You know today you increase you increase increase if I want you integrate
[01:09:38.560 --> 01:09:42.960]   Increasing it by one so the F G H so CD e
[01:09:42.960 --> 01:09:47.920]   And then a B C D so it's ed
[01:09:47.920 --> 01:09:50.800]   I think we have to say it's ed
[01:09:50.800 --> 01:09:52.560]   next
[01:09:52.560 --> 01:09:57.920]   Which design pattern ensures a shared instance? I'm an object that's created once and reused multiple times
[01:09:57.920 --> 01:10:05.600]   I'm gonna say that is a factory pattern. What do you think or is it a builder pattern or it is a singleton?
[01:10:06.640 --> 01:10:10.320]   Which it's a design pattern that ensures a shared instance of an object
[01:10:10.320 --> 01:10:14.160]   It's created once I'm gonna say a factory pattern
[01:10:14.160 --> 01:10:17.760]   Please enter your phone number so we may contact you
[01:10:17.760 --> 01:10:24.320]   Okay, so I have just drawn squiggie the squirrel in effect
[01:10:24.320 --> 01:10:28.480]   All right, do you think they're contacting me?
[01:10:28.480 --> 01:10:34.400]   See I don't like that right there. I don't like phone numbers. Uh, phone numbers are hard. No, that's why that's why I've got
[01:10:34.880 --> 01:10:39.760]   I let google give me a burner number for I have shown a strength in data and mathematics
[01:10:39.760 --> 01:10:44.320]   Based on these results we recommend you study software developer with was you
[01:10:44.320 --> 01:10:51.840]   Demand in your current location suggests a focus in Java a career counselor will be reaching out shortly to help you get started
[01:10:51.840 --> 01:10:57.600]   Your test your test results suggest that perhaps you had a friend help you turn on the computer
[01:10:57.600 --> 01:11:00.320]   Now tell them to never let you have a computer
[01:11:00.320 --> 01:11:03.760]   Was has a message for me to see
[01:11:04.640 --> 01:11:06.640]   Was congratulations. Thank you
[01:11:06.640 --> 01:11:10.480]   You are now on the fast track to get out into the workforce to make a difference
[01:11:10.480 --> 01:11:12.960]   I hope to see you after you graduate
[01:11:12.960 --> 01:11:23.360]   You know, I know I I have no opinion on was you but I'm saying that any game developer that does not hire was to be like the in-game
[01:11:23.360 --> 01:11:30.080]   Like a I advise I love him just popping up like that. That's all well. So how long before my phone rings kids
[01:11:31.440 --> 01:11:37.760]   What do you think let's take a break when we come back release the kraken? I've been waiting to say that I'll show
[01:11:37.760 --> 01:11:42.560]   Our show today brought to you by video blocks from story blocks
[01:11:42.560 --> 01:11:46.800]   We've talked before about how great oh my phone's ringing
[01:11:46.800 --> 01:11:51.760]   Oh, wow, look it's a text message from was
[01:11:51.760 --> 01:11:54.480]   You're awesome

[01:12:00.480 --> 01:12:02.480]   So now they're texting me
[01:12:02.480 --> 01:12:07.440]   There you go hard stop right Andy hard stop. No not getting my phone number. Yeah
[01:12:07.440 --> 01:12:12.800]   Uh video blocks is a way to really improve your
[01:12:12.800 --> 01:12:19.600]   video background on your website your podcast audio put a hero image on your blog

[01:12:32.640 --> 01:12:35.280]   Including 150
[01:12:35.280 --> 01:12:36.400]   115
[01:12:36.400 --> 01:12:42.240]   thousands studio quality HD videos after effects templates motion backions back rounds or more

[01:12:55.600 --> 01:13:01.680]   No outdated footage no more footage for the ugly watermark. I know sometimes people save money by doing that don't
[01:13:01.680 --> 01:13:06.000]   Video blocks is used by the best and get ready. I told you it was affordable
[01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:11.040]   Go to video blocks.com/macbreak and get all the stock video you can imagine
[01:13:11.040 --> 01:13:14.320]   $149 a year
[01:13:14.320 --> 01:13:17.120]   a year
[01:13:17.120 --> 01:13:21.840]   90,000 customers including nbc national geographic the history channel the travel channel
[01:13:21.840 --> 01:13:24.800]   These are really great high quality stock video clips
[01:13:24.800 --> 01:13:29.840]   $149 a year they also have a marketplace which is awesome
[01:13:29.840 --> 01:13:36.000]   So that these are 5 million additional videos that you buy directly from the creators of the video and you save
[01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:40.320]   40% if you sign up and the artists take all 100% of the sales price
[01:13:40.320 --> 01:13:44.240]   So this is a case where video blocks is just providing access
[01:13:44.240 --> 01:13:49.680]   Uh, I love this to a marketplace and and the artist gets all the money
[01:13:49.680 --> 01:13:54.720]   I love that video blocks.com/macbreak all the stock video you can imagine for
[01:13:54.720 --> 01:13:57.760]   $149 a year we've been using it
[01:13:57.760 --> 01:14:04.240]   We're so we'd love it because we were spending a lot more. I mean way more than that for a stock video
[01:14:04.240 --> 01:14:09.440]   Video blocks by story blocks. We think of their support of Mac break weekly
[01:14:09.440 --> 01:14:12.320]   So one day I get up
[01:14:12.320 --> 01:14:17.680]   I got a day off. I think I'm gonna relax. I'm gonna take it easy and the first thing I see is
[01:14:18.240 --> 01:14:20.240]   Oh no
[01:14:20.240 --> 01:14:25.600]   WPA2 the Wi-Fi and crypto. We've been recommending for everybody
[01:14:25.600 --> 01:14:28.560]   Has been cracked
[01:14:28.560 --> 01:14:34.800]   I know we'll be spending literally. I know we krcc which stands for
[01:14:34.800 --> 01:14:39.760]   Key replaying reinstall key reinstallation attack
[01:14:39.760 --> 01:14:43.040]   And I know Steve Gibson's going to dive into this in great depth
[01:14:43.840 --> 01:14:48.560]   But it has something to do with the the four step negotiation
[01:14:48.560 --> 01:14:54.480]   Uh, third step of the four step handshake can be replayed and you get the nonce
[01:14:54.480 --> 01:14:58.240]   The key but yeah, the nonce and once you get the nonce you're in
[01:14:58.240 --> 01:15:03.280]   What that means is somebody who can get first they have to have physical access to the Wi-Fi network, right?
[01:15:03.280 --> 01:15:06.800]   Yeah, you have to be in proximity to the Wi-Fi network. Yeah sitting on your doorstep
[01:15:06.800 --> 01:15:10.400]   They can't do it remotely like they can't be from across the country. They need to be in neighbor within your Wi-Fi range
[01:15:10.400 --> 01:15:13.760]   Yeah, or whatever then now correct me if I'm wrong Renee
[01:15:13.760 --> 01:15:18.160]   But my understanding is they would have the same kind of access that you would they would have if you were in a coffee
[01:15:18.160 --> 01:15:22.320]   An open access coffee shop and you signed in and they signed in right at that point
[01:15:22.320 --> 01:15:23.360]   They're on your net worth
[01:15:23.360 --> 01:15:27.600]   Mutating and it seems to depend a lot on a lot of different things when originally came out
[01:15:27.600 --> 01:15:31.680]   It sounded like exactly that that they that you effectively the
[01:15:31.680 --> 01:15:38.560]   The full encryption was gone and you would have to be as vulnerable as you would be sitting at a Starbucks on an open access point
[01:15:38.880 --> 01:15:43.760]   And some people get confused like that because some coffee shops they give you a username and password and they use wp to
[01:15:43.760 --> 01:15:47.280]   We're talking about the ones that don't force you to enter a username or password
[01:15:47.280 --> 01:15:52.400]   Just an open Wi-Fi access point where anyone else on that network can also see what you're doing on that network
[01:15:52.400 --> 01:15:54.720]   And now it's sort of like well
[01:15:54.720 --> 01:15:59.840]   They can do some kinds of attacks, but they can't do other kinds of attacks and they can't they can change this
[01:15:59.840 --> 01:16:02.320]   But they can't change that they can read this but they can't read that
[01:16:02.320 --> 01:16:07.120]   I think just to be prudent we should assume that they have pretty good access once they get on your network
[01:16:07.360 --> 01:16:09.360]   It has the safest thing to assume with it. Okay
[01:16:09.360 --> 01:16:12.640]   and it's
[01:16:12.640 --> 01:16:14.640]   an issue first of all because
[01:16:14.640 --> 01:16:22.560]   We our advice has been for years remember when we first started using Wi-Fi people said use web wired wireless wired equivalent
[01:16:22.560 --> 01:16:27.280]   Protocol then web was shortly there after crack because it wasn't well designed at all
[01:16:27.280 --> 01:16:30.320]   But ever since we've been telling everybody
[01:16:30.320 --> 01:16:36.240]   I've been telling everybody's been saying all you need to do to secure wife network is turn on wp-a-2 encryption
[01:16:36.640 --> 01:16:38.640]   It works. It's effective
[01:16:38.640 --> 01:16:42.400]   Now it's cracked like web was much the same way rep web was cracked
[01:16:42.400 --> 01:16:47.760]   Patches are going to be a problem not because I would imagine
[01:16:47.760 --> 01:16:52.320]   In fact, I've already talked to the folks at euro because they're a sponsor and they uh, they have it in beta
[01:16:52.320 --> 01:16:54.320]   They have a patch already in beta
[01:16:54.320 --> 01:16:57.440]   Does apple patched it yet or are they're about to patch it?
[01:16:57.440 --> 01:16:58.800]   It is in the car beta
[01:16:58.800 --> 01:17:03.840]   So the iOS 11.1 beta for both developers and the public has the fix in it
[01:17:03.920 --> 01:17:07.680]   And that means it'll roll out to everybody within the next few weeks just a little ways out
[01:17:07.680 --> 01:17:09.280]   uh
[01:17:09.280 --> 01:17:11.280]   Windows is apparently not vulnerable
[01:17:11.280 --> 01:17:17.680]   Android and Linux depending on your version could be android phones have to get an update google has an update
[01:17:17.680 --> 01:17:20.320]   They will be pushing it out soon just everybody
[01:17:20.320 --> 01:17:27.040]   Everybody responsible is saying oh, yes apparently it's easy enough to fix that they're beta testing the fixer right away
[01:17:27.040 --> 01:17:32.160]   Uh, some companies were notified ahead of time monday was the public announcement
[01:17:32.560 --> 01:17:35.120]   But of course the security researcher who found yeah
[01:17:35.120 --> 01:17:40.000]   Bsd kind of jumped the gun which I think is going to lead to some controversy moving forward
[01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:44.720]   They put out a patch that you could have difft and sort of seen what the different with the vulnerability was if you're well
[01:17:44.720 --> 01:17:48.480]   And there are patches for many linuxes google has a patch for android
[01:17:48.480 --> 01:17:54.800]   So patches are rapidly flowing out you yes, you will want to patch your router. Here's the problem
[01:17:54.800 --> 01:17:57.920]   Your internet of things devices
[01:17:58.800 --> 01:18:04.560]   But two problems one is if you have older hardware so for example the latest Samsung phones the pixel phones all of those will be fine
[01:18:04.560 --> 01:18:10.240]   If you have a much older phone the odds of you especially on a certain carriers the odds of you getting an update are really low
[01:18:10.240 --> 01:18:13.520]   Yes, there are 41 percent of android phones will never get updated
[01:18:13.520 --> 01:18:19.120]   Same with routers like if you have a really modern router from a good vendor who's paying attention to all those things like that
[01:18:19.120 --> 01:18:22.400]   Those will be updated apparently the airport is not vulnerable to this attack
[01:18:22.400 --> 01:18:28.000]   I wonder if like microsoft apple didn't follow completely the standard and that ended up being lucky for them
[01:18:28.160 --> 01:18:29.440]   Isn't that when it comes to this?
[01:18:29.440 --> 01:18:29.920]   Wow
[01:18:29.920 --> 01:18:34.880]   But there will be something like if you've had a 10 year old router and you don't even like in the manufacturer
[01:18:34.880 --> 01:18:37.520]   You can't fly anymore. You probably want to replace that router
[01:18:37.520 --> 01:18:40.400]   But
[01:18:40.400 --> 01:18:47.280]   It doesn't have to be your router that gets attacked right it could be any device on your wpa to protected network the clients
[01:18:47.280 --> 01:18:51.760]   Yeah, which means all of those iot devices most of which don't get updated ever
[01:18:51.760 --> 01:18:54.720]   Are a real problem
[01:18:55.440 --> 01:19:01.760]   Right yes, no totally and especially there was some concern over the security cameras that sometimes come bundled with your modems
[01:19:01.760 --> 01:19:08.160]   That treat it because they're a bundle they treat it as an encrypted network when it's not they just basically say that it must be a trusted device
[01:19:08.160 --> 01:19:11.360]   And don't even bother encrypting it and if you get into that again
[01:19:11.360 --> 01:19:13.120]   Like it's it's unclear what they could do
[01:19:13.120 --> 01:19:17.520]   Maybe they can make your printer put out a bunch of garbage or maybe they could try to put malware on your device
[01:19:17.520 --> 01:19:22.160]   Or maybe they can't really do anything at all. We don't we don't have all the details on a per device basis yet
[01:19:22.480 --> 01:19:25.840]   But anything that that you you can't positively identify as safe
[01:19:25.840 --> 01:19:29.040]   I think just out of prudence you have to decide is not safe at this point
[01:19:29.040 --> 01:19:31.520]   and since you don't know the state of
[01:19:31.520 --> 01:19:35.200]   Public Wi-Fi access points whether they've been patched or not
[01:19:35.200 --> 01:19:40.800]   You probably don't want to use Wi-Fi out when you're out and about you might want to disable Wi-Fi on your ipad
[01:19:40.800 --> 01:19:42.800]   Your phone and your laptop for now, right?
[01:19:42.800 --> 01:19:50.240]   I'm certainly to say go ahead any I certainly to say disable automatically connect to no networks
[01:19:50.880 --> 01:19:52.880]   At least for the next month or two
[01:19:52.880 --> 01:19:54.880]   But I think that my my
[01:19:54.880 --> 01:20:00.880]   Understandings that if you're using vpn, it's not going to really affect you. Yes, you should have been using vpn anyway
[01:20:00.880 --> 01:20:06.160]   Yeah, well that really makes it even more important in fact. I I've been I got
[01:20:06.160 --> 01:20:10.000]   A couple of days ago and I've been using it now a new you know
[01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:15.600]   I'm a big proponent of the tiny hardware firewall. I've been recommending them for a while that basically
[01:20:16.240 --> 01:20:21.120]   This is a great solution. They just came out with this they call it the I can't remember the name
[01:20:21.120 --> 01:20:25.440]   It's a funny name, but it's 30 or 40 dollars. It looks like a usb key
[01:20:25.440 --> 01:20:28.560]   Uh, if you want to use it with a mac you have to use an adapter
[01:20:28.560 --> 01:20:31.600]   You can't use it obviously with a phone or ipad
[01:20:31.600 --> 01:20:36.800]   But I can tell you how you can use it and what's smart about this one is this looks to your
[01:20:36.800 --> 01:20:39.440]   computer like an ethernet dongle
[01:20:39.440 --> 01:20:44.480]   So the computer already has a driver for it goes. Oh, yeah. Yeah, you've got ethernet
[01:20:45.440 --> 01:20:49.360]   Do you join the Wi-Fi network even the unsafe Wi-Fi network?
[01:20:49.360 --> 01:20:51.120]   Uh
[01:20:51.120 --> 01:20:54.480]   It works with captive portals because you can do mac address spoofing
[01:20:54.480 --> 01:20:55.920]   So you can actually
[01:20:55.920 --> 01:20:59.440]   Join the captive portal on your computer and then put that mac address in this device
[01:20:59.440 --> 01:21:03.520]   And from then on your connection is coming through this usb port
[01:21:03.520 --> 01:21:06.480]   It's going through a router, but then you could turn on vpn
[01:21:06.480 --> 01:21:10.080]   You have to draw back as this comes from Wi-Fi consulting you have to use one of their
[01:21:10.800 --> 01:21:17.120]   Services either hotspot vpn or their new black cloud hosting which I really like because each person is on a separate vpn server
[01:21:17.120 --> 01:21:20.640]   Um, and uh, it doesn't slow it down too much
[01:21:20.640 --> 01:21:26.320]   If you use this full time out and about you'd be fine plus you can turn this into a Wi-Fi access point
[01:21:26.320 --> 01:21:28.720]   So now you can have your phone
[01:21:28.720 --> 01:21:31.440]   Basically you set up as a Wi-Fi access point this phone
[01:21:31.440 --> 01:21:36.800]   The ipad and everything join this one this vpn and everything including your laptop your access point
[01:21:36.800 --> 01:21:39.120]   uh, your phone and your uh
[01:21:39.360 --> 01:21:43.920]   Your ipad so there are solutions out there. So vpn will protect you is that correct?
[01:21:43.920 --> 01:21:47.280]   I believe yeah
[01:21:47.280 --> 01:21:49.920]   So yes and no, I mean if it's a good vpn
[01:21:49.920 --> 01:21:53.600]   Yes, which is increasingly hard to find there's some really if you roll your own
[01:21:53.600 --> 01:21:58.160]   Yeah, yeah, you're because we found out that some that we thought were trustworthy have been turning over records
[01:21:58.160 --> 01:22:02.320]   They said they didn't have yeah, so it's it's incredibly murky if you have your own vpn
[01:22:02.320 --> 01:22:04.960]   Uh, but like again like you can switch to ethernet
[01:22:04.960 --> 01:22:08.640]   But maybe they're already on your network or they got into network through your kiz nintendo game or something
[01:22:08.640 --> 01:22:10.640]   I mean, I think the whole thing
[01:22:10.640 --> 01:22:15.280]   Um, it's nightmarish. I don't think that's an alarm. I'm saying to say it's it's nightmarish at this point
[01:22:15.280 --> 01:22:19.200]   And it's gonna take a while before we're through it that the only there's a couple good news points here
[01:22:19.200 --> 01:22:23.600]   One is that it's backwards compatible. So we don't need wpa three. We just need them to patch
[01:22:23.600 --> 01:22:27.760]   Uh, this problem the other side is when you patch the clients you're reasonably safe
[01:22:27.760 --> 01:22:30.640]   You should patch everything of course, but once a client get patched
[01:22:30.640 --> 01:22:32.960]   It's relatively safe to use that client
[01:22:32.960 --> 01:22:35.520]   Uh, and the third thing is most people aren't hot targets for this
[01:22:35.680 --> 01:22:42.240]   Like you might have a prankster in your apartment building who downloads some freeware, you know, exploit code and does make your printer do silly things
[01:22:42.240 --> 01:22:46.080]   Uh, but the chances of you being you know sought after by a state
[01:22:46.080 --> 01:22:52.720]   Agent using his techniques are probably minimal. So yeah, I just get those up based on as fast as it's a problem that I have to say
[01:22:52.720 --> 01:22:55.040]   It's public now, but I don't think the tools are out yet
[01:22:55.040 --> 01:22:58.960]   So you don't have to worry yet about the script kitties, but that can only be a few days away. Yeah
[01:22:58.960 --> 01:22:59.840]   Yeah
[01:22:59.840 --> 01:23:04.720]   I have to say that on a day-to-day basis. I'm more I'm less concerned about being targeted by a foreign agent
[01:23:05.280 --> 01:23:13.760]   Than I am by some some kid in the next the next house over who is probably like I was when I was 13 or 14 years old
[01:23:13.760 --> 01:23:17.200]   Where it's like, oh my god, you mean this this code? I this code could actually do this
[01:23:17.200 --> 01:23:21.040]   Wow, I wonder if we can do that instead and then once you are on someone else's network
[01:23:21.040 --> 01:23:24.800]   Yeah, I wonder what resources I can find on this other person's network without being
[01:23:24.800 --> 01:23:27.680]   necessarily malicious just being a
[01:23:27.680 --> 01:23:34.640]   teenager without a sense of how no no no the fact that the fact that you didn't actually break a window and go into my house
[01:23:35.040 --> 01:23:41.520]   And take my TV set and leave with the TV set that doesn't mean that you didn't violate my home by doing this
[01:23:41.520 --> 01:23:46.160]   Uh or people who will say gee what what a bunch of interesting photos and he has on his server
[01:23:46.160 --> 01:23:49.760]   I'm going to take them and then put a music comments on them and post them on reddit
[01:23:49.760 --> 01:23:55.600]   It's that's the stuff that I'm more worried about. I'm worried about it again a kid who is a lot more
[01:23:55.600 --> 01:24:02.560]   Because generally a lot more clever than a lot more clever than I am because they're spending nine or 10 hours a day
[01:24:02.720 --> 01:24:08.400]   Like I might have been when I was a teenager playing with this amazingly cool toy and learning incredibly cool stuff
[01:24:08.400 --> 01:24:11.120]   The amount of obsession that only a teenager could apply
[01:24:11.120 --> 01:24:13.520]   uh towards uh a new adventure
[01:24:13.520 --> 01:24:19.680]   So I was I was not I was not doing I was doing things that is as a teenager that might be termed very illegal today
[01:24:19.680 --> 01:24:22.000]   Uh, they were innocent
[01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:27.040]   In my own head back then but again going through someone else's computer or a thousand miles away
[01:24:27.040 --> 01:24:29.120]   Just because they left a door open
[01:24:29.120 --> 01:24:33.520]   Doesn't mean that they were inviting people inside that's a hard thing for kids to understand the uh
[01:24:33.520 --> 01:24:38.000]   That's that's why things like this kind of get me concerned the security research who who discovered this
[01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:42.320]   Matty van hoff has a website crack attacks.com k r ack
[01:24:42.320 --> 01:24:46.560]   Attacks.com. There's a video there. You can watch it's also on youtube
[01:24:46.560 --> 01:24:50.560]   That shows the use of a python script to implement the attack
[01:24:50.560 --> 01:24:53.440]   He has not released it. Thank goodness
[01:24:53.440 --> 01:24:58.240]   Especially because a python script would be easy enough for somebody to you know kind of
[01:24:58.880 --> 01:25:03.600]   Weaponized he says it'll be released though. Once everyone has had a reasonable chance to update the devices
[01:25:03.600 --> 01:25:06.640]   I'm not sure what that mean. You know how long that will be
[01:25:06.640 --> 01:25:08.160]   but
[01:25:08.160 --> 01:25:13.920]   The key uh here is as you said rene that we don't need a new version of wpa
[01:25:13.920 --> 01:25:15.920]   You can patch
[01:25:15.920 --> 01:25:20.480]   Wpa you want to make sure that your router is patched as soon as possible
[01:25:20.480 --> 01:25:26.880]   So check with your router manufacturer see if they have a timeline. I don't think any I think ubiquity's been patched
[01:25:27.520 --> 01:25:32.160]   Morockeys been patched enterprise ubiquity. I don't know if their commercial enterprise has been patched right? Yeah
[01:25:32.160 --> 01:25:37.840]   Uh, so the patches are very few so far, but they will be pouring out. I'm sure over the next few weeks
[01:25:37.840 --> 01:25:41.520]   Update as quickly as you can update your uh
[01:25:41.520 --> 01:25:47.040]   So it's not just the the routers the client and the access point have to be patched
[01:25:47.040 --> 01:25:53.360]   And then that becomes the big issue if you have devices and I bet you almost everybody does on your network that
[01:25:53.840 --> 01:25:57.920]   Are not getting firmware updates and that's where it's going to really be a big issue
[01:25:57.920 --> 01:26:02.800]   So you're going to want to check, you know, if you have a ring video doorbell you want to make sure they're updating you if you have
[01:26:02.800 --> 01:26:07.120]   Of you know, IP cameras in your house. You want to make sure they're getting updated
[01:26:07.120 --> 01:26:10.800]   Uh, all of that must be updated and anything that doesn't get updated
[01:26:10.800 --> 01:26:17.760]   Your echoes have to be updated. You know anything that doesn't get updated must be removed. I think either remove for your network on put on a separate
[01:26:17.760 --> 01:26:20.720]   Network as steve has recommended for years
[01:26:20.720 --> 01:26:23.200]   uh because iot is so on
[01:26:23.840 --> 01:26:28.720]   Predictable he generally recommends putting it out to you not on a guest network on your same router
[01:26:28.720 --> 01:26:32.240]   But on a separate routing network and i'm going to be doing that
[01:26:32.240 --> 01:26:38.480]   Uh tonight. This is one of those things where it's likely we won't understand the full ramifications of it for some time to come
[01:26:38.480 --> 01:26:41.760]   Because of the breadth of the big big story
[01:26:41.760 --> 01:26:48.160]   uh, easily the biggest story of the week and again, uh security now is coming up steve says already said he's going to be uh
[01:26:49.280 --> 01:26:52.720]   Talking about this so there'll be a lot more details more tech
[01:26:52.720 --> 01:26:56.800]   I know some people are sensitive to saying that this is a big deal and say well, it's just security alarmism
[01:26:56.800 --> 01:27:02.080]   I'm I'm tend to be very conservative about raising alarms over security because I think a lot of it is sensationalized
[01:27:02.080 --> 01:27:05.360]   But I don't think you can look at an exploit based on wpa
[01:27:05.360 --> 01:27:07.760]   Which all of us have been saying is secure for years
[01:27:07.760 --> 01:27:12.320]   As being anything short of uh of something you need to pay absolute attention to for the immediate future
[01:27:12.320 --> 01:27:14.560]   You could I mean look you could wait. I mean
[01:27:14.560 --> 01:27:17.840]   If you want don't want to be sensationalistic you could wait until
[01:27:18.560 --> 01:27:23.680]   Ransomware is injected into thousands of people's systems and and you know, I mean till stuff happens
[01:27:23.680 --> 01:27:26.720]   Then it would be cause for fire here on fire
[01:27:26.720 --> 01:27:31.680]   But this is this is a flaw that could open the door for that kind of thing fairly
[01:27:31.680 --> 01:27:36.240]   And the worst part of it is that you're only as secure as the worst technology you have on your network for this
[01:27:36.240 --> 01:27:37.360]   It's not the best
[01:27:37.360 --> 01:27:40.480]   The google stuff the apple stuff the microsoft stuff might be fantastic
[01:27:40.480 --> 01:27:47.360]   But there's a ton of other stuff on a lot of people's networks that will just obliviate all of the good security practices that those companies and
[01:27:48.480 --> 01:27:55.040]   If anything you try not to scare people this is but this is a this is just a good opportunity to remind people of what best practice
[01:27:55.040 --> 01:27:58.480]   What what the best practices are and why it's you should
[01:27:58.480 --> 01:28:03.680]   Not be scared of every device you put on your network but be aware that every time
[01:28:03.680 --> 01:28:05.280]   It's like changing the locks in your house
[01:28:05.280 --> 01:28:09.520]   You don't just simply buy whatever's cheapest at walmart that that will change the security of your house
[01:28:09.520 --> 01:28:11.760]   The fact that you've changed a lock
[01:28:11.760 --> 01:28:13.760]   And so as long as you keep reminding people that
[01:28:14.400 --> 01:28:17.040]   There are things that there are things that you can control
[01:28:17.040 --> 01:28:24.560]   You can oh you can mix these things are designed to be updated to become more secure to solve problems when vulnerabilities occur
[01:28:24.560 --> 01:28:31.840]   That there are activities that are dangerous and you should try to avoid and if you can't avoid them try to use these solutions
[01:28:31.840 --> 01:28:34.720]   Like vp ends that will at least mitigate some of the danger
[01:28:34.720 --> 01:28:38.240]   You don't want to you don't want to get people to you know
[01:28:38.240 --> 01:28:42.240]   Run screaming and make it into the streets streets. You just want them to
[01:28:42.880 --> 01:28:46.080]   Give them the tools so that they will hear something like this and they will know
[01:28:46.080 --> 01:28:50.160]   What they're supposed to do with it do with this information how they can make themselves more safe
[01:28:50.160 --> 01:28:51.120]   Yeah
[01:28:51.120 --> 01:28:57.040]   We will talk much more about this in a little bit on secure about half an hour from now. It's a great show
[01:28:57.040 --> 01:28:59.680]   Um, Matthew is back
[01:28:59.680 --> 01:29:04.320]   Matthew Roberts who does uh, he and dung and sinfield do the great
[01:29:04.320 --> 01:29:08.080]   4k drone tours of the spaceship campus
[01:29:08.080 --> 01:29:12.080]   This will be familiar to you rene because you've been there you lucky dog
[01:29:12.880 --> 01:29:16.480]   but the uh the campus can apple park continues uh
[01:29:16.480 --> 01:29:19.200]   being improved
[01:29:19.200 --> 01:29:22.960]   And here is the latest drone footage. It actually almost looks like it's
[01:29:22.960 --> 01:29:28.240]   You know kind of finished there's still bulldozers in the middle as they finish the landscaping up
[01:29:28.240 --> 01:29:32.320]   You didn't get to see much beyond the steve jobs theater. I presume rene
[01:29:32.320 --> 01:29:37.360]   No, we didn't get to see the like you could see the the donut uh apple campus too in the distance
[01:29:37.360 --> 01:29:40.560]   But it was huge, but it was still in the distance. They probably ten minute walk away
[01:29:41.360 --> 01:29:44.560]   Still putting in trees look at all those solar panels man
[01:29:44.560 --> 01:29:49.840]   That is really cool and actually you could tell jonnie. I've looked at the design
[01:29:49.840 --> 01:29:53.200]   You know in a macro scale because it is beautiful on the roof
[01:29:53.200 --> 01:29:55.600]   A lot of buildings don't look so good on the roof
[01:29:55.600 --> 01:29:58.320]   It is beautiful all around
[01:29:58.320 --> 01:30:03.200]   The estimate no one knows, but the estimate is almost half a trillion dollars
[01:30:03.200 --> 01:30:06.240]   Uh cost for this. I don't know if that's
[01:30:07.280 --> 01:30:11.040]   Possible, but that can't be right. Wait a minute minimalist design is expensive
[01:30:11.040 --> 01:30:14.080]   You know, did I miss they can have an NCAA football program for that one?
[01:30:14.080 --> 01:30:16.800]   I might have I might have misread that
[01:30:16.800 --> 01:30:21.040]   Is that the visitor centers top? I can't tell from that angle. I want to say not half a trillion
[01:30:21.040 --> 01:30:26.400]   But yeah, that is a visit 42 billion. There's the there's the visitor center. Yeah, that's where you're from up there
[01:30:26.400 --> 01:30:28.960]   That's where you go to get your badge to go to the uh
[01:30:28.960 --> 01:30:31.600]   Event is that right?
[01:30:31.600 --> 01:30:33.040]   The visitor center. Yeah, uh, yeah
[01:30:33.040 --> 01:30:36.800]   Well, the visitor center like you go in and the visitor center is the first thing you hit which has the right
[01:30:37.120 --> 01:30:41.200]   The cafe max, but it's not a full one. It's more like a coffee shop cafe max and that will be over the public
[01:30:41.200 --> 01:30:44.640]   Oh, and they're in the yes. Yeah, they're in the distance. You can see the steve jobs
[01:30:44.640 --> 01:30:47.760]   Theater where you are so you get some idea of how far away
[01:30:47.760 --> 01:30:52.560]   And they want to keep the unwashed press away from the main campus, of course
[01:30:52.560 --> 01:30:56.400]   Yeah, and also I think I think that's a very that was a very smart move
[01:30:56.400 --> 01:30:58.880]   They know that they're going to get a lot of people who are going to make
[01:30:58.880 --> 01:31:02.240]   Pilled remitges to the to the campus and it's it's nice
[01:31:02.400 --> 01:31:08.160]   They don't I don't think people necessarily who visit want to walk in and be able to be greeted by johnnie
[01:31:08.160 --> 01:31:10.640]   I have been giving a willy wonka tour of the design lab
[01:31:10.640 --> 01:31:15.600]   But I don't but I do think that if you give them here is a place that has the big a big apple logo
[01:31:15.600 --> 01:31:20.560]   You can take a selfie in front of here is a place you can get a cup of coffee and spend 40 dollars on a t-shirt
[01:31:20.560 --> 01:31:26.400]   That's really all they want and by giving them sort of that distraction. It really solves a lot of security problems that
[01:31:26.400 --> 01:31:31.360]   Uh, sometimes they were only able to awkwardly handle right at one inch loop
[01:31:31.840 --> 01:31:33.840]   Really looking pretty
[01:31:33.840 --> 01:31:39.120]   Beautiful beautiful job. Let me get the somebody estimated the cost of the apple of apple park
[01:31:39.120 --> 01:31:44.400]   I obviously is not half a trillion. That's insane. Um, five johnny's fee. I mean
[01:31:44.400 --> 01:31:49.280]   I am I am so lily forward. Okay. Let me get that. There you go. That's
[01:31:49.280 --> 01:31:55.200]   The ring alone the ring alone was 427.6 million. That was yeah
[01:31:55.200 --> 01:31:57.520]   That was the just the spaceship
[01:31:57.840 --> 01:32:04.160]   the theater 180 million the parking structures 113 million. This is a guest from build zoom which is a
[01:32:04.160 --> 01:32:11.840]   A company that helps users find general contractors. So it's just it's just a guess as much like the bill of materials guests
[01:32:11.840 --> 01:32:17.760]   You see sometimes on how much it costs to make an apple phone. Oh wait till you see apples margins when they sell this thing. Yeah, no kidding
[01:32:17.760 --> 01:32:23.280]   The gym 16.7 million in maintenance building 2 million. That's a lot for a shed
[01:32:23.280 --> 01:32:25.280]   Um
[01:32:25.280 --> 01:32:29.200]   So the total cost around five billion give or take
[01:32:29.200 --> 01:32:34.800]   That's you know, not it's not half a trillion
[01:32:34.800 --> 01:32:40.400]   But it's not insignificant on the other hand if you have more than 200 billion in the bank
[01:32:40.400 --> 01:32:43.840]   Not not undoable
[01:32:43.840 --> 01:32:46.160]   Uh, I want to thank apple
[01:32:46.160 --> 01:32:52.800]   For donating a million dollars to a wildfire relief matching employee donations
[01:32:52.800 --> 01:33:00.480]   Chris as you many of you know, we had some horrific wildfires not just here in our area in the wine country, but also in southern, California
[01:33:00.480 --> 01:33:03.120]   um, the death toll was
[01:33:03.120 --> 01:33:05.120]   is horrific at this point and
[01:33:05.120 --> 01:33:09.920]   Number of houses the the high school my kids went to already
[01:33:09.920 --> 01:33:15.920]   50 families lost their homes in that high school and since that high school only has several hundred students that's
[01:33:15.920 --> 01:33:19.280]   Not that's not that's horrific. It's terrible
[01:33:19.920 --> 01:33:23.280]   um and many of our friends we we keep hearing of friends and
[01:33:23.280 --> 01:33:30.640]   Family we have a massage therapist who comes in and gives massages to the uh staff every uh, Wednesday
[01:33:30.640 --> 01:33:36.160]   Her she lost her home. She was able to save her dogs her family safe, but she lost her home
[01:33:36.160 --> 01:33:39.760]   Uh, and so there are many stories like that if you go up to san erosa
[01:33:39.760 --> 01:33:45.360]   Uh, just the the feeling of shock, uh, is palpable up there
[01:33:45.360 --> 01:33:48.960]   So thank you for that a million dollar, uh, donation
[01:33:49.600 --> 01:33:55.040]   Apples done that before with the iTunes donations to the red cross and so forth. So yeah, Puerto Rico
[01:33:55.040 --> 01:33:57.520]   Texas. Yeah, there's plenty of plenty of
[01:33:57.520 --> 01:34:03.760]   Need out there. Yeah, and I think they're doing the doubling uh for employee donations as well still that's what this says
[01:34:03.760 --> 01:34:08.800]   Yeah, the one million is matching employee donations. So that's really really fantastic
[01:34:08.800 --> 01:34:14.560]   Uh, let's take a break when we come back picks of the week my friends, but first a word

[01:36:03.680 --> 01:36:07.440]   Time for our picks of the week and the in our co-kick things off for us
[01:36:08.240 --> 01:36:13.760]   uh, really huge update to uh, bb edit bb edit 12 was just released just last week
[01:36:13.760 --> 01:36:16.480]   Uh, and it's it's huge
[01:36:16.480 --> 01:36:22.720]   It's not and it's it's uh, you might even call it the I don't know bb bb edit 12 s
[01:36:22.720 --> 01:36:26.240]   Because it wasn't if you uh, if you run it
[01:36:26.240 --> 01:36:31.040]   It's not as though they threw away the old bb edit and totally rebuilt totally rebuilt the experience from the ground up
[01:36:31.040 --> 01:36:35.200]   But they rebuilt everything behind the user interface from the ground up
[01:36:35.600 --> 01:36:40.480]   Uh, bb edit is one of the oldest, uh, trade my oldest apps
[01:36:40.480 --> 01:36:43.040]   Uh, that's for the mac ever
[01:36:43.040 --> 01:36:48.400]   It was it's where we're not it wasn't something that's been evolved every two months
[01:36:48.400 --> 01:36:50.240]   That's how they got to 12. It's been around
[01:36:50.240 --> 01:36:55.280]   There are people who I think who can drive right now who were not yet born when the first version of bb edit
[01:36:55.280 --> 01:37:01.440]   Uh was released and as you can imagine because it's become because it really is the premiere flat text editor
[01:37:01.440 --> 01:37:05.200]   Uh, and programmers text editor. It basically incorporates
[01:37:05.600 --> 01:37:10.720]   Everything that makes it more awesome and as a result over the years it means that there's so
[01:37:10.720 --> 01:37:16.240]   It the solutions that uh, the barebone software came up with to provide features
[01:37:16.240 --> 01:37:20.720]   Uh came before apple caught up with bare bones and created their own solutions
[01:37:20.720 --> 01:37:27.200]   So based on one of the really a huge amount of the effort that went into this latest version is to bring it all up to cocoa
[01:37:27.200 --> 01:37:32.080]   Remove the stuff that was again their own solutions and embrace apple solutions
[01:37:32.480 --> 01:37:38.000]   Uh, the end effect is that a lot of stuff that the you are supposed to get for free with every piece of software
[01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:44.560]   Like split view and stuff like that is now part of you get for free with bb edit because again, you're using the standard
[01:37:44.560 --> 01:37:47.440]   uh, standard mac OS classes and libraries
[01:37:47.440 --> 01:37:51.440]   Uh, but there's also a whole bunch of as usual a whole bunch of tweaks that just make
[01:37:51.440 --> 01:37:56.720]   Whenever you do manipulating text so much easier and so much simpler
[01:37:56.720 --> 01:38:02.320]   Uh, a lot of what I use bb edit for is I have uh, I have like
[01:38:02.320 --> 01:38:07.040]   A whole bunch of text files that need to be mung into a different format or into a different
[01:38:07.040 --> 01:38:09.600]   uh, I've downloaded let's say
[01:38:09.600 --> 01:38:13.760]   Uh, 500k text file imagine a 500k text file
[01:38:13.760 --> 01:38:19.600]   And I need to extract from that all of the data points that I need for a piece of research that I'm doing
[01:38:19.600 --> 01:38:23.680]   I can do it via text search use stuff that I could always do it with bb edit
[01:38:23.680 --> 01:38:26.160]   But instead of doing it now with like four or five steps
[01:38:26.160 --> 01:38:31.520]   I can do it with one step and now make that repeatable because I have a text file that says here's the stuff
[01:38:31.520 --> 01:38:33.520]   I'm looking for and here's what I want you to do with it
[01:38:33.520 --> 01:38:35.840]   And it will simply use that as the the basis
[01:38:35.840 --> 01:38:41.440]   Uh, and it could do things like transform things in the clipboard so that if I'm preparing
[01:38:41.440 --> 01:38:47.680]   HTML for instance and I want to cop I want to take a piece of text that I've just taken off of a website
[01:38:47.680 --> 01:38:52.960]   But I want it to be formatted the way I wanted to with my css markup and and its own div text and stuff like that
[01:38:52.960 --> 01:38:57.120]   It's no longer pasted into this and then again run a grep or run something on it
[01:38:57.120 --> 01:38:57.680]   It is
[01:38:57.680 --> 01:39:01.600]   Simply the fact that it was on the clipboard and then I pasted it from the clipboard into this document
[01:39:01.600 --> 01:39:03.440]   Turns it into what I want
[01:39:03.440 --> 01:39:09.520]   And so imagine every single thing you do as a programmer or just simply as someone who works with text for a living that involves
[01:39:09.520 --> 01:39:13.120]   You have to do the same stupid set of steps over and over and over again
[01:39:13.120 --> 01:39:19.520]   And imagine this app understanding what you want to do and just doing it for you and also giving you every single piece of
[01:39:19.520 --> 01:39:24.080]   uh, hands-on equipment hands-on tools that you need just to get through the day
[01:39:24.480 --> 01:39:29.760]   There's a reason why this really is the standard editor for people who work with text
[01:39:29.760 --> 01:39:34.000]   Whether it's people who are publishing to the web or people who are writing code. There's a reason why there
[01:39:34.000 --> 01:39:39.440]   Really is no major competitor to this app and that's because the team at bare bones
[01:39:39.440 --> 01:39:43.040]   Does nothing but listen to people who use this tool
[01:39:43.040 --> 01:39:50.560]   And do nothing but work their butts off to make sure that these people are very very happy and get through their work day in the most linear
[01:39:50.880 --> 01:39:55.920]   Manner possible. It's 50 bucks. I think there's an upgrade. There's there's a cheap upgrade if you
[01:39:55.920 --> 01:40:00.160]   Have bought like an old old version of it. Uh, I can't recommend it highly enough
[01:40:00.160 --> 01:40:03.600]   It's it's on that list of apps where if it is on your mac
[01:40:03.600 --> 01:40:08.960]   At some point you are going to use it. You're going to thank god that you actually put this in on the machine
[01:40:08.960 --> 01:40:14.800]   Love rich seagull love bb edit. He's been on the show before and we're really glad to support him and
[01:40:14.800 --> 01:40:19.280]   That's amazing. He's got to 12 versions now bb edit. That's really yeah
[01:40:19.600 --> 01:40:23.040]   And he's he is he is a very very good friend of mine. So I should I should mention that
[01:40:23.040 --> 01:40:29.040]   But that also means that I am I am aware of like all the lunches and all the dinners that I have not had with them for the past
[01:40:29.040 --> 01:40:33.520]   For the past couple of months because it's just nothing but getting this update out
[01:40:33.520 --> 01:40:37.280]   And once again, it's it's some of the hardest work to get through
[01:40:37.280 --> 01:40:43.680]   It's easy to it's easy to be the person on the iphone team who's look i'm we're removing the bezels and we're placing the home
[01:40:43.680 --> 01:40:47.840]   The home button and we're doing face id. It's hard to be the person says well
[01:40:48.480 --> 01:40:53.040]   My team is responsible for integrating this new modem software
[01:40:53.040 --> 01:40:58.080]   So that in the 18 regions in which it can't get maximum bandwidth on non lte
[01:40:58.080 --> 01:41:01.040]   It will actually shift to a new version of lte
[01:41:01.040 --> 01:41:07.440]   Nonetheless, that work is as hard as anything else and as important as anything else and that's so much of what went to bb edit
[01:41:07.440 --> 01:41:08.080]   12
[01:41:08.080 --> 01:41:11.360]   I've been using it for the past couple of weeks and it's like it's familiar
[01:41:11.360 --> 01:41:17.520]   But still new and wonderful. So and I can't I can't recommend it highly now. Yay rich. Good job
[01:41:18.080 --> 01:41:20.080]   Yay rich
[01:41:20.080 --> 01:41:24.160]   Renee rich
[01:41:24.160 --> 01:41:26.560]   So my pick was good if he bev yet it as well
[01:41:26.560 --> 01:41:29.520]   And i'm glad that Andy beat me to it because he did far more job
[01:41:29.520 --> 01:41:33.120]   I've kept saying that I'm embarrassed by how little I use a bb edit
[01:41:33.120 --> 01:41:37.120]   But I think that also is emblematic of just how much you can do with bb
[01:41:37.120 --> 01:41:41.760]   I like I use it to write in but other people use it to create miracles in so i'm just i'm so happy
[01:41:41.760 --> 01:41:45.120]   I just yeah, I just buy it to use it rich to be honest with you
[01:41:45.440 --> 01:41:50.080]   And though and the few times a year I use it because I really love it that you can have a command line inside it
[01:41:50.080 --> 01:41:55.680]   Which means you can edit your bash scripts and stuff and your commands and I love the text factories
[01:41:55.680 --> 01:42:01.840]   So it's not unusual three or four times a year. I've got like a but a spreadsheet of christmas card
[01:42:01.840 --> 01:42:03.440]   mailing
[01:42:03.440 --> 01:42:07.280]   Stuff and I want to kind of put it in the right order bb edit
[01:42:07.280 --> 01:42:11.680]   There's no better tool for me and they got that new columns each analysis. You'll even have to change it from being a spread
[01:42:11.920 --> 01:42:17.200]   Yeah, I just use it like I have these long lists for articles that I just need to change things on and there's no other way
[01:42:17.200 --> 01:42:20.640]   But then using like there's sort of grip. I call it grub for dummies. What I do
[01:42:20.640 --> 01:42:24.800]   It's like I need to add all this to that and it works and nothing else does it. Yeah, yeah
[01:42:24.800 --> 01:42:30.880]   I read the whole book on grip, but I still use bb edit script. I really I really like it so great
[01:42:30.880 --> 01:42:32.560]   You're picking the way sir
[01:42:32.560 --> 01:42:36.800]   My backup I have two one is fills coffee, which I know you know you Leo
[01:42:37.040 --> 01:42:42.560]   Probably super familiar with anyone in the bay area is super familiar with I I go there whenever I am
[01:42:42.560 --> 01:42:45.360]   You know anywhere near kapartino or the south bay area
[01:42:45.360 --> 01:42:51.360]   And I fill up my suitcase with as many bags of filtered soul and a few of the other ones as possible
[01:42:51.360 --> 01:42:56.960]   They have really really good coffee. It's such good coffee that when I give it to other coffee aficionados
[01:42:56.960 --> 01:42:59.280]   They say hot damn where did you get this coffee from?
[01:42:59.280 --> 01:43:03.120]   I cannot recommend it enough. It's not it's not like the fanciest breast lads
[01:43:03.120 --> 01:43:09.440]   It's for people who really want to filter down their coffee and have a really gorgeous says fills will really get you wired
[01:43:09.440 --> 01:43:12.640]   Is so i caffeine brew, huh?
[01:43:12.640 --> 01:43:17.520]   You go in there if you're not familiar with the place I was super confused the first time I ordered I walked in
[01:43:17.520 --> 01:43:21.600]   And I thought you'd go to the cash, but you don't you go up to your individual barista
[01:43:21.600 --> 01:43:23.920]   Who then makes you what you want has you taste it?
[01:43:23.920 --> 01:43:27.280]   Make sure it's to your liking more cream less cream more sugar less sugar
[01:43:27.280 --> 01:43:31.920]   No sugar all that kind of stuff and then make sure you're happy with it before you walk off and it's just
[01:43:32.720 --> 01:43:35.040]   There's a line up there tech people sheriffs
[01:43:35.040 --> 01:43:40.160]   Everybody just waiting for their cup of fills and it fills with a z and you can order from it
[01:43:40.160 --> 01:43:42.880]   So that's what I do now because I can't get to the bay area often enough
[01:43:42.880 --> 01:43:47.680]   So I'll order a few bags, especially for the holidays and give them away and everyone super happy
[01:43:47.680 --> 01:43:54.800]   Can I kind of say that that is one hell of an endorsement because you're this endorsement of of this product is coming from somebody
[01:43:54.800 --> 01:43:56.080]   who
[01:43:56.080 --> 01:44:01.440]   Several times a month is crossing international borders in and out of the United States of America
[01:44:01.680 --> 01:44:06.320]   And being scrutinized by people that know that drug meals a make a lot of international trips
[01:44:06.320 --> 01:44:10.080]   And be often pack the drugs and coffees so that they can't be sniffed out
[01:44:10.080 --> 01:44:15.200]   So to love this coffee so much there is the result there risking that kind of harassment
[01:44:15.200 --> 01:44:20.720]   I that's that's good coffee is even a non coffee drinker like me is going to be taking pig and
[01:44:20.720 --> 01:44:25.600]   Pay attention of it. It is so good. My other pick I mentioned that in passing last week
[01:44:25.600 --> 01:44:30.800]   But a lot of people asked me for more information. It's a program by eCam which is another awesome boston area developer
[01:44:31.360 --> 01:44:34.800]   You know two brothers work on the product and it's called phone view
[01:44:34.800 --> 01:44:39.360]   And all it does is let you pull stuff off your iphone and push stuff back on your iphone
[01:44:39.360 --> 01:44:42.240]   And it's great for doing those sorts of spring cleanings we talked about
[01:44:42.240 --> 01:44:46.080]   It's also great if you want to back up your sms messages because a lot where your i messages
[01:44:46.080 --> 01:44:49.520]   Because a lot of times people don't realize that those in many cases
[01:44:49.520 --> 01:44:53.040]   Up until now are trapped on the device and if you get rid of the device or you lose it
[01:44:53.040 --> 01:44:58.640]   You know you'll get back some from your backup, but you might not get back all or you might want to clean out your messages
[01:44:58.640 --> 01:45:00.640]   But you know keep a record of them
[01:45:00.800 --> 01:45:03.680]   Going back you can pull out photos. You can pull out music files
[01:45:03.680 --> 01:45:08.320]   You what we used it for was game data because georgia was updating her phone
[01:45:08.320 --> 01:45:11.680]   And she made it quite clear that if anything happened to her game save data
[01:45:11.680 --> 01:45:14.640]   The world would not long have me
[01:45:14.640 --> 01:45:20.080]   So we just made sure we copied off all the game save data copied it back on her. It was totally fine
[01:45:20.080 --> 01:45:23.520]   No one no one was no one was killed in the process of doing it
[01:45:23.520 --> 01:45:26.800]   And it's just it's a great utility to have if you have a mac
[01:45:27.280 --> 01:45:30.800]   And you like to tinker around with the with what little file system there is on your iphone
[01:45:30.800 --> 01:45:39.520]   Thank you rene richy. I'm already mentioned my pick, but i'll give you a little more information. It's the tiny hardware firewall given
[01:45:39.520 --> 01:45:42.480]   Crack and the problem was crack
[01:45:42.480 --> 01:45:46.240]   A lot of people are looking at vpn's I try the company that does the firewall
[01:45:46.240 --> 01:45:52.480]   Or rather the vpn on this is a Wi-Fi consulting out of washington dc. They've been doing this is the 90s
[01:45:52.480 --> 01:45:56.160]   I totally trust them as a vpn provider partly because they're not cheap
[01:45:56.880 --> 01:46:02.080]   It's $91 a year for the vpn. I would not use a free vpn to save my life
[01:46:02.080 --> 01:46:06.160]   Uh because if it's free there's a there's somehow they're making money
[01:46:06.160 --> 01:46:11.440]   So not I think $91 is very ferris a few cents a day six cents a day something like that
[01:46:11.440 --> 01:46:17.440]   Uh, but there's another advantage to it this hardware that you put put between you and the internet
[01:46:17.440 --> 01:46:22.960]   Really is fantastic. This is the new one. I just got they call it the budica
[01:46:22.960 --> 01:46:25.520]   And it is a usb key
[01:46:25.840 --> 01:46:30.000]   It has uh, it shows up on your computer as an ethernet adapter
[01:46:30.000 --> 01:46:35.760]   Which means it works on everything including linux wat mac windows because everybody sees usb ethernet adapters
[01:46:35.760 --> 01:46:37.760]   That's a very simple thing to support
[01:46:37.760 --> 01:46:44.160]   But then it connects to the uh, Wi-Fi and at the very minimum it's a router
[01:46:44.160 --> 01:46:48.560]   But it has two Wi-Fi radios in it as well, which means you can connect to
[01:46:48.560 --> 01:46:53.040]   Uh coffee shop Wi-Fi and then use it with the second radio
[01:46:53.600 --> 01:46:58.880]   To connect your iPhone and ipad while your laptop is also protected. This is the interface. I've actually
[01:46:58.880 --> 01:47:02.640]   Connected it to this computer and logged logged in
[01:47:02.640 --> 01:47:09.360]   Uh, and so the trick is to associate it with a wireless. This one by the way doesn't use hot spot vpn
[01:47:09.360 --> 01:47:12.000]   It uses black hole cloud, which is their newest vpn service
[01:47:12.000 --> 01:47:15.440]   Everybody on it gets a unique vpn
[01:47:15.440 --> 01:47:19.680]   They don't use uh open vpn. They use a different vpn
[01:47:19.680 --> 01:47:22.960]   Uh program called I want to say
[01:47:23.840 --> 01:47:25.840]   Is it vernet? What is it called?
[01:47:25.840 --> 01:47:29.440]   Anyway, they consider it a more secure vpn software
[01:47:29.440 --> 01:47:32.640]   You get a hardware firewall just by virtue of using it
[01:47:32.640 --> 01:47:37.760]   So right now i'm connected to the internet via a fire protected by a firewall by a router
[01:47:37.760 --> 01:47:43.040]   But then you can also turn on vpn. You can turn on tour. You can even turn on ad blocking
[01:47:43.040 --> 01:47:45.280]   So let me show you how quick and easy it is
[01:47:45.280 --> 01:47:48.560]   Uh, i'm going to scan for the Wi-Fi CEOs using it at home
[01:47:48.560 --> 01:47:51.840]   Uh, I see uh, twit guest
[01:47:52.560 --> 01:47:54.560]   94 signal
[01:47:54.560 --> 01:47:57.440]   I'm going to type in the
[01:47:57.440 --> 01:48:00.240]   You don't have to hide it. It's just thoughts
[01:48:00.240 --> 01:48:07.440]   The password you can and for full security disable the wireless network, uh, which i've done here
[01:48:07.440 --> 01:48:09.920]   um because uh
[01:48:09.920 --> 01:48:11.680]   the uh
[01:48:11.680 --> 01:48:15.120]   Having a Wi-Fi radio on might be a cause for concern
[01:48:15.120 --> 01:48:19.920]   So if you just want to use it on your laptop, it's wired you can name the wireless network
[01:48:19.920 --> 01:48:23.200]   i'm going to now connect to our, uh, brick guest
[01:48:23.200 --> 01:48:26.960]   And once we've connected to our router
[01:48:26.960 --> 01:48:30.800]   Uh, I will be surfing the internet through the Wi-Fi
[01:48:30.800 --> 01:48:34.320]   It looks like an ethernet connection to this windows machine
[01:48:34.320 --> 01:48:40.880]   And then I can also do additional things like turn on ad blocking turn on vpn and turn on uh, tours
[01:48:40.880 --> 01:48:44.800]   Let me connect through the brick guest since i've set it up
[01:48:44.800 --> 01:48:49.840]   Connect to vpn. You want complete anonymity. You can connect to tour. Oops. I guess it does
[01:48:49.840 --> 01:48:51.680]   Didn't take so I probably typed the password wrong
[01:48:51.680 --> 01:48:54.160]   Uh, and ad blocking is built in
[01:48:54.160 --> 01:49:01.360]   I really love this the device itself is inexpensive because it's hardware and it's just a little old thing you can just carry it around
[01:49:01.360 --> 01:49:06.240]   Um, I think you get additional protection than just using a software of vpn
[01:49:06.240 --> 01:49:10.720]   If you want to know more about a black hole cloud, you can go to blackhole cloud.com
[01:49:10.720 --> 01:49:13.840]   But if you want to get the tiny hardware firewall, this is the one I use
[01:49:13.840 --> 01:49:16.320]   um, it is
[01:49:16.560 --> 01:49:20.160]   At tiny hardware firewall.com wire guard. That's what they use
[01:49:20.160 --> 01:49:24.240]   They use the wire guard software, which they say is faster than open vpn
[01:49:24.240 --> 01:49:26.400]   By the way, my my benchmarks do
[01:49:26.400 --> 01:49:30.080]   I mean you're always going to have overhead with vpn even more if you add tour to that
[01:49:30.080 --> 01:49:33.680]   But my benchmarks are it's quite usable on our gigabit network
[01:49:33.680 --> 01:49:38.720]   I was able to get what was it uh yesterday about or saturday about 10 or 15 megabits
[01:49:38.720 --> 01:49:43.440]   Which is more than enough to surf the net and uh, listen to audio probably wouldn't want to watch a video through it
[01:49:44.000 --> 01:49:46.000]   Very nice solution
[01:49:46.000 --> 01:49:50.880]   Everybody should have in their briefcase, uh from tiny hardware firewall
[01:49:50.880 --> 01:49:56.400]   How does it work through uh through a challenge page like when you're at the starbucks and says oh, so clever
[01:49:56.400 --> 01:50:02.000]   So clever so this works with all captive portals. So what you do is you join the challenge page on your computer
[01:50:02.000 --> 01:50:07.760]   Uh, but then you as to get your computers and mac address and assign it to the device
[01:50:07.760 --> 01:50:10.000]   then you
[01:50:10.000 --> 01:50:15.280]   Turn off wifi on your computer this device is connected now and because it's the same mac addresses your computer
[01:50:15.280 --> 01:50:19.120]   In almost all these captive portal situations it goes. Oh, yeah, yeah, I I know you
[01:50:19.120 --> 01:50:22.880]   And it lets you through and so now you're using starbucks
[01:50:22.880 --> 01:50:28.320]   You went through the captive portal on your computer because you had to but you're using starbucks through this
[01:50:28.320 --> 01:50:31.040]   So it's a really that's a very clever
[01:50:31.040 --> 01:50:39.600]   Idea, uh, i'm being told by be web dude in our chat room that because of the encryption in this is only ship to us addresses and apo fbo addresses
[01:50:40.080 --> 01:50:43.440]   Uh, so you cannot get it outside the us however
[01:50:43.440 --> 01:50:50.000]   If you want something similar to this and you can't buy it. This is the easiest way to go 40 bucks 90 bucks a year
[01:50:50.000 --> 01:50:56.960]   Uh, you can make one with a raspberry pie and we have a know-how where we show you how to make a raspberry pie router
[01:50:56.960 --> 01:51:03.920]   Uh with firmware by the way interestingly, um, DDWRT has already been patched for the crack exploit
[01:51:04.560 --> 01:51:11.440]   Yay open source so you could put a DDWRT on a raspberry pie and use that and you can use tour and all the same things
[01:51:11.440 --> 01:51:14.240]   You just have to roll your own you can't and I wouldn't be surprised
[01:51:14.240 --> 01:51:17.200]   Other providers maybe in canada places like that
[01:51:17.200 --> 01:51:25.360]   Uh, sorry Renee. I said it's the raspberry pie as a gift that just keeps on giving isn't that amazing 35 bucks, you know amazing
[01:51:25.360 --> 01:51:31.200]   Basically this it's interesting. I mean this is you know, it's a little computer. It's got dsp chip in here software memory
[01:51:31.840 --> 01:51:38.240]   firmware, uh, it's 30 bucks. It's similar to a raspberry pie, but it it's a machine learning for firewall. It's fast
[01:51:38.240 --> 01:51:40.640]   It's very fast. Hey that wraps up
[01:51:40.640 --> 01:51:43.200]   This gripping edition
