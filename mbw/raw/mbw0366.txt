[00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:10.200]   Microsoft buying Nokia too little too late and a whole lot more.
[00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.040]   Mac Break Weekly is next.

[00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:35.760]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly, the show that covers the Macintosh and Apple.
[00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:37.760]   Spheriverse.
[00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:41.760]   Here he is, ladies and gentlemen, from last in Massachusetts or its environs.
[00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:43.760]   We never really know exactly where Andy is.
[00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:45.760]   Andy and Ico the Chicago Sun-Times.
[00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:47.760]   I must present a moving target to my many enemies.
[00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:49.760]   He's got a fork in the fork.
[00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:51.760]   It's my Spock fork.
[00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:53.760]   That looks like bunny hiers.
[00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:57.760]   It took an unexpected ride, my garbage disposal, so I took it out.
[00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:59.760]   I said, "This is wonderful.
[00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:00.760]   They're probably going to fix this."
[00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:02.760]   I've just invented the fork.
[00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:04.760]   I call it the spork.
[00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:05.760]   Rev 2.
[00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:08.760]   That does seem like that could be something.
[00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:09.760]   Quick patent.
[00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:14.760]   I think that if you made those and even if you paid the licensing fee to Star Trek,
[00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:16.760]   you would sell several boxes of these.
[00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:22.760]   I think that NemoI should open a Bistro, operate for maybe just six weeks,
[00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:29.760]   and then just make all of his money just selling t-shirts for the NemoI Bistro with that as the logo.
[00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:34.760]   I think it would work better because of the pointy double-tined effect as well.
[00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:39.760]   Yeah, well, it would trap lots of food and would cause all kinds of lower GI distress
[00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:42.760]   without the careful flossing of each piece utensil.
[00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:43.760]   You have to floss it.
[00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:48.760]   But I think for a cheap joke, I mean, if you're going to get people to open up the sluices of both ends
[00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:52.760]   for five days after they eat their meal, sometimes it's worth that.
[00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:54.760]   Yowza.
[00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:59.760]   Also here, as always, Renee Ritchie of iMore.com.
[00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:00.760]   Hello, Renee.
[00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:01.760]   Hi, Leo.
[00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:04.760]   I think it's nice that Andy goes and picks up all of Magneto's used forks
[00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:06.760]   in his wonderful public service of his.
[00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:09.760]   Quick comic book reference.
[00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:14.760]   And from Liverpool, our good friend, Dom McAllister of Screencast's online.
[00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:16.760]   Nice to see you, Dom, and see you in ages.
[00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:17.760]   It's been a while.
[00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:18.760]   It's been a while.
[00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:20.760]   I think it was probably because I was so quiet on the last one,
[00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:22.760]   but it was the Skype latency, honestly.
[00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:27.760]   It's really hard sometimes to get into you guys because you've all got telepathic connections
[00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:28.760]   when you're going to speak.
[00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:30.760]   I'm going to try my best today to be a bit more chatty.
[00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:33.760]   I also realised that I've got my TV in the wrong places as well.
[00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:35.760]   It should really be across my shoulder.
[00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:37.760]   Mine is actually above my main monitor up there.
[00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:38.760]   I know you're doing it wrong.
[00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:40.760]   I'll rejig the office for next time.
[00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:46.760]   Please don't ever feel like we make judgments about people as to how often the participant...
[00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:47.760]   That's not...
[00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:48.760]   Oh, don't have that done on.
[00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:49.760]   He hardly said anything.
[00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:51.760]   No, no, we never do that.
[00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:52.760]   You're in.
[00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:55.760]   You don't have to prove anything.
[00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:56.760]   That's okay.
[00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:58.760]   You're always on.
[00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:00.760]   Anyway, did you redesign your studio?
[00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:01.760]   It's last as we saw you last.
[00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:03.760]   New looks different.
[00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:06.760]   A little bit, yeah, sort of.
[00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:07.760]   I've got...
[00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:09.760]   It's like you're building something back there.
[00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:10.760]   Is the wall open?
[00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:11.760]   What's going on?
[00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:12.760]   No, that's...
[00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:14.760]   Well, I've got some cupboards down the side.
[00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:15.760]   Cupboards?
[00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:16.760]   Hide all my clutter and...
[00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:17.760]   Ahhh!
[00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:18.760]   Cupboards.
[00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:19.760]   So that's the...
[00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:20.760]   Your guitars have been put away.
[00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:21.760]   Yeah.
[00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:23.760]   It's the usual trick of just showing you a tiny corner of the studio.
[00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:26.760]   That's not clean and tidy and everything else is a complete tip.
[00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:30.760]   People, of course, have got my walking desk in the studio now as well.
[00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:31.760]   Oh!
[00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:32.760]   With a treadmill?
[00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:33.760]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:34.760]   Aren't you fancy?
[00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:35.760]   I wonder if I can...
[00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:36.760]   Well, let me see if I can just...
[00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:37.760]   I've always wanted to do that.
[00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:38.760]   This might work.
[00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:39.760]   Me too.
[00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:40.760]   Only just how?
[00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:41.760]   It is right here.
[00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:43.760]   That's quite the contraption.
[00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:47.760]   I've got my sit-down desk where I'm at now and I've got my walking desk so I can...
[00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:50.760]   It's only certain things I can do when I'm walking.
[00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:56.760]   Sort of using my trackpad pen is out of the question, but standard computer-based stuff,
[00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:58.760]   you know, you're using the keyboard and the trackpad is full.
[00:04:58.760 --> 00:04:59.760]   Really?
[00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:00.760]   You can type?
[00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:01.760]   Oh, type, great.
[00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:02.760]   Yeah, type...
[00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:03.760]   Well, I'm a two-finger type of stand-up.
[00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:04.760]   I'm a screencast that way.
[00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:05.760]   Here we go.
[00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:06.760]   And then...
[00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:08.760]   Yeah, I have to have a podcast once.
[00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:09.760]   Is it really?
[00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:12.760]   Yeah, and it wasn't so much getting out of breath, it was the problem.
[00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:15.760]   It was the movement to be bouncing down with it.
[00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:16.760]   Where's Dan getting to?
[00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:17.760]   He seems to be walking.
[00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:20.760]   Also, it was the problem of your makeup girl having to keep you powdered.
[00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:21.760]   Mm-hmm.
[00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:24.760]   I think it's welly over the sweat dripping down, isn't it?
[00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:25.760]   No.
[00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:26.760]   No, it's fine.
[00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:28.760]   The thing is it's not for exercise, it's to keep you moving.
[00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:30.760]   So you don't really break out in a sweat and it's...
[00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:35.760]   You know, you just do quite a few steps, but I can do like an hour and a half in the morning,
[00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:38.760]   an hour and a half in the afternoon, and it's great.
[00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:42.760]   Well, truthfully, the big story has nothing to do with Apple today, and I think we should
[00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:43.760]   mention it.
[00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:47.760]   We just did some special coverage with Tom Merritt and company, including our windows folks,
[00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:49.760]   Paul Therat and Mary Jo Foley.
[00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:54.760]   Late last night, Labor Day in the United States, big, big holiday in the United States.
[00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:59.760]   Apparently, they were burning the midnight oil, though, because late yesterday, Microsoft
[00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:06.760]   announced it was acquiring Nokia for €7.8 or something.
[00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:07.760]   A million-year billion-year...
[00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:08.760]   I don't know.
[00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:10.760]   It's about $7 billion.
[00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:12.760]   Somebody made a graphic.
[00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:15.760]   This is from Lueola.net, courtesy of our chatroom.
[00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:22.760]   This company, you see they have 2% of the phone marketplace just bought this company.
[00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:23.760]   They have 1.2%.
[00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:28.760]   You have to actually zoom in to see them between Huawei and others.
[00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:36.760]   I think this means nothing for Apple.
[00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:38.760]   It's like, "Yeah, fine."
[00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:40.760]   It's a common HP.
[00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:42.760]   They're at the kids' table.
[00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:46.760]   Yeah, but my reaction, though, was that...
[00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:49.760]   I'm of two minds on it.
[00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:55.760]   Number one, there are a lot of companies that have been simply buying things to give themselves
[00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:56.760]   components that they're missing.
[00:06:56.760 --> 00:06:58.760]   I remember that Apple was also in this game.
[00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:00.760]   They needed a new operating system.
[00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:03.760]   They were failing to create a new operating system, so they bought a new operating system,
[00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:06.760]   and they bought Steve Jobs back as part of the package.
[00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:09.760]   So that worked out... buying necks worked out rather well for Apple.
[00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:11.760]   So let's not poo-poo this.
[00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:16.760]   On the other hand, I think that when the reasons why the iPhone and the iPad have become a success
[00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:22.760]   is that it wasn't simply a product or a product team that they bought and simply switched the nameplates
[00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:23.760]   on their buildings.
[00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:27.760]   It was part of a consistent brand culture and a consistent product culture.
[00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:33.760]   That is, you can't really remove their mobile strategy without affecting every other thing
[00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:34.760]   that they're making.
[00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:40.760]   Whereas, here is a case of Microsoft saying, as Apple did back in the '90s, we don't have
[00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:42.760]   a phone hardware business.
[00:07:42.760 --> 00:07:44.760]   We really want to have a phone hardware business.
[00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:45.760]   Let's buy a phone hardware business.
[00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:51.760]   So it's going to be interesting to see if they can... if they will be influenced by Nokia
[00:07:51.760 --> 00:07:55.760]   or if Nokia... everything that is good about Nokia, everything that caused them to make such great phones
[00:07:55.760 --> 00:08:00.760]   over the past year to see the potential of Windows Phone, if that's going to be sort of subsumed
[00:08:00.760 --> 00:08:02.760]   by a Microsoft culture.
[00:08:02.760 --> 00:08:03.760]   So we're hoping.
[00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:10.760]   And the last thought was that before we get too proud, as Apple people saying, "Yeah, you see,
[00:08:10.760 --> 00:08:13.760]   you have to... these people have to farm out their innovation."
[00:08:13.760 --> 00:08:20.760]   It can be kind of scary to think that if you have a deep enough wallet, it's possible for you to
[00:08:20.760 --> 00:08:21.760]   know, to be honest with you.
[00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:23.760]   And then you have to think about how to do that.
[00:08:23.760 --> 00:08:26.760]   And then you have to think about how to do that.
[00:08:26.760 --> 00:08:28.760]   And then you have to think about how to do that.
[00:08:28.760 --> 00:08:30.760]   And then you have to think about how to do that.
[00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:33.760]   And then you have to think about how to do that.
[00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:36.760]   And then you have to think about how to do that.
[00:08:36.760 --> 00:08:39.760]   And then you have to think about how to do that.
[00:08:39.760 --> 00:08:41.760]   And then you have to think about how to do that.
[00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:43.760]   And then you have to think about how to do that.
[00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:45.760]   And then you have to think about how to do that.
[00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:47.760]   And then you have to think about how to do that.
[00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:50.760]   And then you have to think about how to do that.
[00:08:50.760 --> 00:08:53.760]   And then you have to think about how to do that.
[00:08:53.760 --> 00:08:56.760]   And then you have to think about how to do that.
[00:08:56.760 --> 00:08:58.760]   And then you have to think about how to do that.
[00:08:58.760 --> 00:09:00.760]   And then you have to think about how to do that.
[00:09:00.760 --> 00:09:02.760]   And then you have to think about how to do that.
[00:09:02.760 --> 00:09:04.760]   And then you have to think about how to do that.
[00:09:04.760 --> 00:09:06.760]   And then you have to think about how to do that.
[00:09:06.760 --> 00:09:08.760]   And then you have to think about how to do that.
[00:09:08.760 --> 00:09:10.760]   And then you have to think about how to do that.
[00:09:10.760 --> 00:09:12.760]   And then you have to think about how to do that.
[00:09:12.760 --> 00:09:14.760]   And then you have to think about how to do that.
[00:09:14.760 --> 00:09:17.760]   And then you have to think about how to do that.
[00:09:17.760 --> 00:09:20.760]   And then you have to think about how to do that.
[00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:22.760]   And then you have to think about how to do that.
[00:09:22.760 --> 00:09:24.760]   And then you have to think about how to do that.
[00:09:24.760 --> 00:09:26.760]   And then you have to think about how to do that.
[00:09:26.760 --> 00:09:28.760]   And then you have to think about how to do that.
[00:09:28.760 --> 00:09:30.760]   And then you have to think about how to do that.
[00:09:30.760 --> 00:09:32.760]   And then you have to think about how to do that.
[00:09:32.760 --> 00:09:34.760]   And then you have to think about how to do that.
[00:09:34.760 --> 00:09:36.760]   And then you have to think about how to do that.
[00:09:36.760 --> 00:09:38.760]   And then you have to think about how to do that.
[00:09:38.760 --> 00:09:40.760]   And then you have to think about how to do that.
[00:09:40.760 --> 00:09:42.760]   And then you have to think about how to do that.
[00:09:42.760 --> 00:09:44.760]   And then you have to think about how to do that.
[00:09:44.760 --> 00:09:46.760]   And then you have to think about how to do that.
[00:09:46.760 --> 00:09:48.760]   And then you have to think about how to do that.
[00:09:48.760 --> 00:09:50.760]   And then you have to think about how to do that.
[00:09:50.760 --> 00:09:52.760]   And then you have to think about how to do that.
[00:09:52.760 --> 00:09:54.760]   And then you have to think about how to do that.
[00:09:54.760 --> 00:09:56.760]   And then you have to think about how to do that.
[00:09:56.760 --> 00:09:58.760]   And then you have to think about how to do that.
[00:09:58.760 --> 00:10:00.760]   And then you have to think about how to do that.
[00:10:00.760 --> 00:10:02.760]   And then you have to think about how to do that.
[00:10:02.760 --> 00:10:04.760]   And then you have to think about how to do that.
[00:10:04.760 --> 00:10:06.760]   And then you have to think about how to do that.
[00:10:06.760 --> 00:10:08.760]   And then you have to think about how to do that.
[00:10:08.760 --> 00:10:10.760]   And then you have to think about how to do that.
[00:10:10.760 --> 00:10:12.760]   And then you have to think about how to do that.
[00:10:12.760 --> 00:10:14.760]   And then you have to think about how to do that.
[00:10:14.760 --> 00:10:16.760]   And then you have to think about how to do that.
[00:10:16.760 --> 00:10:18.760]   And then you have to think about how to do that.
[00:10:18.760 --> 00:10:20.760]   And then you have to think about how to do that.
[00:10:20.760 --> 00:10:22.760]   And then you have to think about how to do that.
[00:10:22.760 --> 00:10:24.760]   And then you have to think about how to do that.
[00:10:24.760 --> 00:10:26.760]   And then you have to think about how to do that.
[00:10:26.760 --> 00:10:28.760]   And then you have to think about how to do that.
[00:10:28.760 --> 00:10:30.760]   And then you have to think about how to do that.
[00:10:30.760 --> 00:10:32.760]   And then you have to think about how to do that.
[00:10:32.760 --> 00:10:34.760]   And then you have to think about how to do that.
[00:10:34.760 --> 00:10:36.760]   And then you have to think about how to do that.
[00:10:36.760 --> 00:10:38.760]   And then you have to think about how to do that.
[00:10:38.760 --> 00:10:42.760]   So the question for the Microsoft deal is what is Microsoft buying, he says.
[00:10:42.760 --> 00:10:44.760]   And I think it's very interesting.
[00:10:44.760 --> 00:10:48.760]   I mean, Nokia, is it -- what division of Nokia do they buy?
[00:10:48.760 --> 00:10:50.760]   They didn't buy all of it, just the devices and services.
[00:10:50.760 --> 00:10:51.760]   So one that matters.
[00:10:51.760 --> 00:10:53.760]   And one that matters, which is what Microsoft says and says.
[00:10:53.760 --> 00:10:59.760]   And the other interesting point is that this is the fun speculation we can engage in podcasts
[00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:02.760]   as opposed to really intense news business reporting.
[00:11:02.760 --> 00:11:06.760]   It's possible that that sort of sheds some light on the timing of Ballmer's announcement of retiring.
[00:11:06.760 --> 00:11:10.760]   That they might also be buying a prospective CEO.
[00:11:10.760 --> 00:11:12.760]   That might be very much like acquiring next time.
[00:11:12.760 --> 00:11:17.760]   Yeah, it made me think that maybe -- and this is nothing but speculation.
[00:11:17.760 --> 00:11:20.760]   Again, this is the fun conversation you have on podcasts.
[00:11:20.760 --> 00:11:21.760]   Let me stress that.
[00:11:21.760 --> 00:11:26.760]   I could see a scenario in which Ballmer knew he wanted out.
[00:11:26.760 --> 00:11:28.760]   He knew that the other people wanted them out.
[00:11:28.760 --> 00:11:33.760]   And now that they sort of have the new guy lined up, they can make that announcement
[00:11:33.760 --> 00:11:36.760]   and start that transition without having to actually make any announcement.
[00:11:36.760 --> 00:11:41.760]   So that's something that I was wondering because Nokia CEO is a pretty sharp guy.
[00:11:41.760 --> 00:11:42.760]   It's very interesting.
[00:11:42.760 --> 00:11:43.760]   It's very interesting.
[00:11:43.760 --> 00:11:44.760]   I'm sorry.
[00:11:44.760 --> 00:11:46.760]   Former Microsofty went to Nokia.
[00:11:46.760 --> 00:11:53.760]   Former Microsofty, also someone who is sort of tracked for the larger, more glass lined offices
[00:11:53.760 --> 00:11:56.760]   at Microsoft before he left.
[00:11:56.760 --> 00:12:00.760]   Who knows as to what his lifelong goals are.
[00:12:00.760 --> 00:12:06.760]   That would be sort of perfect cheap irony for this to be a complete next acquisition
[00:12:06.760 --> 00:12:10.760]   where they buy the company and that CEO becomes the new CEO.
[00:12:10.760 --> 00:12:15.760]   I wonder if it's less next and more HP Palm or more Motorola Google.
[00:12:15.760 --> 00:12:17.760]   The biggest acquisition was next.
[00:12:17.760 --> 00:12:20.760]   It was OS X but it was Steve Jobs in the corporate culture.
[00:12:20.760 --> 00:12:21.760]   Like you mentioned.
[00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:25.760]   It's unclear to me what problem Nokia solves for Microsoft that they weren't already doing
[00:12:25.760 --> 00:12:26.760]   in a certain fashion.
[00:12:26.760 --> 00:12:29.760]   Stephen Eelop left Microsoft went to Nokia.
[00:12:29.760 --> 00:12:34.760]   He hasn't exactly increased their market share or increased their value while he was there.
[00:12:34.760 --> 00:12:37.760]   So he basically went there, got Nokia down in values.
[00:12:37.760 --> 00:12:39.760]   Microsoft could buy it more easily.
[00:12:39.760 --> 00:12:43.760]   And Microsoft, if nothing else, has proven with Windows Phone and with the surface that
[00:12:43.760 --> 00:12:45.760]   Windows isn't a feature people want on mobile.
[00:12:45.760 --> 00:12:46.760]   It's not a beachhead.
[00:12:46.760 --> 00:12:48.760]   It's a barrier to entry.
[00:12:48.760 --> 00:12:50.760]   And maybe Nokia would have been more successful without Microsoft.
[00:12:50.760 --> 00:12:53.760]   Maybe Microsoft pulled them down more than they pulled Microsoft up.
[00:12:53.760 --> 00:12:57.760]   So bringing that in-house to Microsoft when they have that massive corporate culture
[00:12:57.760 --> 00:13:01.760]   and no experience in doing devices and things like that, it's unclear to me whether anything
[00:13:01.760 --> 00:13:04.760]   changes or anything actually gets better for doing this.
[00:13:04.760 --> 00:13:11.760]   You could make the case that some have that Eelop destroyed Microsoft, I mean Nokia,
[00:13:11.760 --> 00:13:15.760]   by choosing Windows Phone when it was clearly the mistake for Nokia to do that.
[00:13:15.760 --> 00:13:21.760]   And that some say perhaps Nokia was about to switch to Android and this could have been
[00:13:21.760 --> 00:13:24.760]   a preemptive move to keep them from doing so.
[00:13:24.760 --> 00:13:27.760]   Without Nokia, Windows Phone is a flop.
[00:13:27.760 --> 00:13:28.760]   I mean that is very clear.
[00:13:28.760 --> 00:13:34.760]   Nobody, you know what, HTC, Samsung, they make Windows phones, but they're an afterthought
[00:13:34.760 --> 00:13:35.760]   to their Android business.
[00:13:35.760 --> 00:13:39.760]   And to Ben Thompson's point, whoever bought Nokia for their operating system, people bought
[00:13:39.760 --> 00:13:43.760]   it because they were fantastic phones and Windows Phone did nothing to increase the value
[00:13:43.760 --> 00:13:44.760]   of them making fantastic hardware.
[00:13:44.760 --> 00:13:46.760]   No, Android would have been a...
[00:13:46.760 --> 00:13:50.760]   Imagine a Nokia 1020 Andy with an Android operating system, would that not be a preferable choice?
[00:13:50.760 --> 00:13:55.760]   That would be a preferable choice, but would that have solved Nokia's problems?
[00:13:55.760 --> 00:13:56.760]   Would it be...
[00:13:56.760 --> 00:13:59.760]   If they had become an also...
[00:13:59.760 --> 00:14:06.760]   In many ways, I think that the 1020 would be an absolute world beater if it ran iOS or
[00:14:06.760 --> 00:14:07.760]   Android.
[00:14:07.760 --> 00:14:11.760]   On the other hand, you start to look at what is Nokia's goals in producing a phone like
[00:14:11.760 --> 00:14:12.760]   that.
[00:14:12.760 --> 00:14:17.760]   They don't want to be an alternative phone in a market that has at least...
[00:14:17.760 --> 00:14:21.760]   They would count at least six super premium, wonderful Android phones out there.
[00:14:21.760 --> 00:14:25.760]   And now you'll capture just those people that really want a great camera.
[00:14:25.760 --> 00:14:30.760]   Would you rather have a tighter ecosystem that allows them to do better things than they
[00:14:30.760 --> 00:14:31.760]   can do with Android?
[00:14:31.760 --> 00:14:32.760]   I don't think so, I mean...
[00:14:32.760 --> 00:14:33.760]   I don't think so.
[00:14:33.760 --> 00:14:35.760]   Let's let Don McAllister...
[00:14:35.760 --> 00:14:37.760]   Mr. Internet lag, join us.
[00:14:37.760 --> 00:14:43.760]   I think one of the things that strikes me with the whole acquisition is the reason why they've
[00:14:43.760 --> 00:14:44.760]   done it.
[00:14:44.760 --> 00:14:48.760]   There's a couple of sort of proven over the past decade that you really do need to own the complete
[00:14:48.760 --> 00:14:51.760]   stack of software and hardware right through.
[00:14:51.760 --> 00:14:57.760]   So you can use the synergies between the platform and the software to get the best out of the
[00:14:57.760 --> 00:14:59.760]   actual devices that you're making.
[00:14:59.760 --> 00:15:03.760]   And I think that's been Microsoft's recent problem in that they've been making the platform
[00:15:03.760 --> 00:15:07.760]   that's making the software, but they've had to liaise with third party suppliers and
[00:15:07.760 --> 00:15:11.760]   they've gone out on a limb and tried to do their own thing with the surface.
[00:15:11.760 --> 00:15:16.760]   But they've probably realised now look to get control of this and to create the best products
[00:15:16.760 --> 00:15:20.760]   we really do need to own that whole thing from end to end.
[00:15:20.760 --> 00:15:25.760]   And the fact that ELOP is actually in there as well I think is an extra piece of the puzzle
[00:15:25.760 --> 00:15:29.760]   because people are suggesting that he is going to take over to the next CEO.
[00:15:29.760 --> 00:15:33.760]   I mean the guy has got some chops as well because I think he was in Macromedia and sold
[00:15:33.760 --> 00:15:38.760]   that to Adobe and now he's been into Nokia and sold that to back to Microsoft.
[00:15:38.760 --> 00:15:45.760]   So they probably have realised now that they need to own the whole piece to develop products
[00:15:45.760 --> 00:15:50.760]   that might reach the same class or outclass Apple and also they get in the future CEO
[00:15:50.760 --> 00:15:53.760]   potentially within the same deal.
[00:15:53.760 --> 00:15:55.760]   Renee, your turn.
[00:15:55.760 --> 00:15:59.760]   Well, you know, Blackberry owned the whole piece in Microsoft Lite with the kit and they tried
[00:15:59.760 --> 00:16:01.760]   with the Zoom, they tried with the surface.
[00:16:01.760 --> 00:16:06.760]   The Apple model works for Apple because of a lot of reasons, not just because they own
[00:16:06.760 --> 00:16:08.760]   the entire integration stack.
[00:16:08.760 --> 00:16:10.760]   I mean Nintendo is struggling and they own the whole piece.
[00:16:10.760 --> 00:16:14.760]   There's no panacea to success just by knowing all your good and hard work.
[00:16:14.760 --> 00:16:17.760]   Yeah, I'd say it's the answer but that might be what they, you know, have they considered,
[00:16:17.760 --> 00:16:19.760]   that's what they've considered as a way forward.
[00:16:19.760 --> 00:16:21.760]   Well, it's going to do them any good at all.
[00:16:21.760 --> 00:16:22.760]   Is a different turn.
[00:16:22.760 --> 00:16:26.760]   And it might have been a better answer if Nokia got an operating system rather than Microsoft
[00:16:26.760 --> 00:16:28.760]   got a manufacturer sadly.
[00:16:28.760 --> 00:16:32.760]   Well, that's all there is to say about Nokia Microsoft and it's the news cycle has shifted.
[00:16:32.760 --> 00:16:33.760]   So goodbye.
[00:16:33.760 --> 00:16:37.760]   That was it.
[00:16:37.760 --> 00:16:38.760]   It was over.
[00:16:38.760 --> 00:16:39.760]   You enjoyed your day in the sun.
[00:16:39.760 --> 00:16:40.760]   Good luck to you.
[00:16:40.760 --> 00:16:42.760]   Right, if you get work.
[00:16:42.760 --> 00:16:47.760]   We're going to talk about the invitations they have appeared and I will ask the panel if they
[00:16:47.760 --> 00:16:51.760]   have received their bubbles but first to word from our friends at Citrix.
[00:16:51.760 --> 00:16:57.760]   Makers of go to meeting the powerfully simple way to meet and collaborate with colleagues
[00:16:57.760 --> 00:17:01.760]   and clients anywhere, prospective clients.
[00:17:01.760 --> 00:17:02.760]   Meetings are so important.
[00:17:02.760 --> 00:17:07.760]   I know, you know, it's kind of the word I hated most when we were working at Tech TV.
[00:17:07.760 --> 00:17:08.760]   Time for a meeting.
[00:17:08.760 --> 00:17:10.760]   Oh, every day we had the editorial meeting.
[00:17:10.760 --> 00:17:16.760]   But I have to admit it's when you share ideas is when you cut through, you know, the organizational
[00:17:16.760 --> 00:17:18.760]   more asked when you can really get something done.
[00:17:18.760 --> 00:17:20.760]   That's why you have to have meetings.
[00:17:20.760 --> 00:17:24.760]   The ideal would be to make meetings more efficient, more effective.
[00:17:24.760 --> 00:17:28.760]   And how difficult is it when your teams are spread out as ours are?
[00:17:28.760 --> 00:17:32.760]   You've got Massachusetts, Montreal and Liverpool here.
[00:17:32.760 --> 00:17:36.060]   That's why, you know, it's really great to have a tool that lets you see each other face
[00:17:36.060 --> 00:17:42.280]   to face, be on the same screen, cut through the, you know, the organizational more asked,
[00:17:42.280 --> 00:17:46.560]   get to the point, do it efficiently and quickly, go to meeting with HD faces.
[00:17:46.560 --> 00:17:48.760]   It's what we use and it is fabulous.
[00:17:48.760 --> 00:17:50.840]   It lets you see each other.
[00:17:50.840 --> 00:17:52.920]   That's really a big boon.
[00:17:52.920 --> 00:17:55.240]   It lets you see each other's screens.
[00:17:55.240 --> 00:17:56.760]   I want you to try it free for 30 days.
[00:17:56.760 --> 00:18:02.960]   You can use it, of course, on a Mac or a PC, but also on any mobile device, you can even
[00:18:02.960 --> 00:18:04.360]   present from an iPad.
[00:18:04.360 --> 00:18:09.600]   So you can be sitting on your iPad using the iPads, built in speakers and microphone and
[00:18:09.600 --> 00:18:11.480]   camera to attend the meeting.
[00:18:11.480 --> 00:18:12.680]   You can show them your screen.
[00:18:12.680 --> 00:18:13.980]   You can present.
[00:18:13.980 --> 00:18:18.920]   You can have a keynote, you know, beautiful, brilliant keynote pitch on your iPad and boom,
[00:18:18.920 --> 00:18:20.320]   boom, boom, anywhere.
[00:18:20.320 --> 00:18:22.920]   I have to say, I really love go to meeting.
[00:18:22.920 --> 00:18:24.360]   I want you to try it free for 30 days.

[00:18:37.240 --> 00:18:40.440]   Anybody get an invitation?
[00:18:40.440 --> 00:18:42.600]   I was checking my mail all morning.
[00:18:42.600 --> 00:18:48.240]   This is one week out from the supposed September 10th.
[00:18:48.240 --> 00:18:52.360]   Apple set, test in the past and this seems to be true again this time.
[00:18:52.360 --> 00:18:56.880]   I've been out invitations exactly seven days before the meeting.
[00:18:56.880 --> 00:18:58.680]   I'm searching my mail for Apple.
[00:18:58.680 --> 00:19:02.000]   A P P L E. Anybody get an invitation?
[00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:03.000]   Apple.
[00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:04.880]   A P P L E. Not you, Renee.
[00:19:04.880 --> 00:19:05.880]   No, really?
[00:19:05.880 --> 00:19:07.800]   Always a bridesmaid, never a bride.
[00:19:07.800 --> 00:19:09.160]   I understand Don's in England.
[00:19:09.160 --> 00:19:11.440]   They're probably thinking, no, we're not going to say anything.
[00:19:11.440 --> 00:19:13.280]   Yeah, well, I don't even get an invite to the year.
[00:19:13.280 --> 00:19:14.280]   They do have a UK event.
[00:19:14.280 --> 00:19:16.640]   They sometimes have a big press conference down in London.
[00:19:16.640 --> 00:19:18.160]   I should invite you to that.
[00:19:18.160 --> 00:19:22.320]   Yeah, but if they're going to stream again this year and I hope they will, I'm sure
[00:19:22.320 --> 00:19:24.080]   they will do a live event again.
[00:19:24.080 --> 00:19:25.600]   You know, I'm flying, flying me.
[00:19:25.600 --> 00:19:26.960]   I won't fly all that way.
[00:19:26.960 --> 00:19:28.960]   Oh, look, I got an iTunes store bill.
[00:19:28.960 --> 00:19:30.320]   No, that's not it.
[00:19:30.320 --> 00:19:32.240]   You got an ebook, that is.
[00:19:32.240 --> 00:19:33.440]   Andy, come on.
[00:19:33.440 --> 00:19:35.240]   You got an invitation, right?
[00:19:35.240 --> 00:19:36.040]   Yes, I did.
[00:19:36.040 --> 00:19:37.200]   Yeah.
[00:19:37.200 --> 00:19:38.360]   Hey.
[00:19:38.360 --> 00:19:40.160]   So, you know why I'm happy?
[00:19:40.160 --> 00:19:43.640]   Because that your association with me has not tarnished you.
[00:19:43.640 --> 00:19:45.440]   Is the main reason I'm happy.
[00:19:45.440 --> 00:19:47.520]   Oh, it's tarnished me, but I'm still getting absolutely.
[00:19:47.520 --> 00:19:49.960]   It's made your fork bend.
[00:19:49.960 --> 00:19:52.200]   So, Jim Dowrimple has a picture on the loop.
[00:19:52.200 --> 00:19:54.880]   Of course, Jim got one.
[00:19:54.880 --> 00:19:56.160]   And it has bubbles.
[00:19:56.160 --> 00:19:59.480]   And the tagline is, this should brighten everyone's day.
[00:19:59.480 --> 00:20:01.640]   Well, obviously it's iOS 7 bubbles.
[00:20:01.640 --> 00:20:04.480]   Oh, lots of colors.
[00:20:04.480 --> 00:20:05.480]   Yeah.
[00:20:05.480 --> 00:20:06.480]   What else?
[00:20:06.480 --> 00:20:09.160]   Are they announcing a new bubble pipe?
[00:20:09.160 --> 00:20:12.320]   Could be around iPhone.
[00:20:12.320 --> 00:20:13.320]   The eye pipe.
[00:20:13.320 --> 00:20:14.320]   Bright shiny new colors.
[00:20:14.320 --> 00:20:19.280]   It could be brightening photos with a new smoke.
[00:20:19.280 --> 00:20:20.280]   New filters.
[00:20:20.280 --> 00:20:22.080]   Apple announces new filters.
[00:20:22.080 --> 00:20:30.480]   I got to say that at this point, every time I see one of these invitations, I flashback
[00:20:30.480 --> 00:20:31.480]   to the amazing race.
[00:20:31.480 --> 00:20:33.040]   I feel I see the most.
[00:20:33.040 --> 00:20:37.680]   Because that's how they phrase the challenges before they tell you what they are.
[00:20:37.680 --> 00:20:40.520]   Our journalists have to choose between two options.
[00:20:40.520 --> 00:20:44.280]   A brighter new day for seven ways to sunshine.
[00:20:44.280 --> 00:20:48.400]   In seven ways to sunshine, they will have a briefing on the seven new colors of the new
[00:20:48.400 --> 00:20:49.400]   iPhone.
[00:20:49.400 --> 00:20:50.400]   And brighten your day.
[00:20:50.400 --> 00:20:54.880]   They got a two hour technical briefing on the new digital signal processor that increases
[00:20:54.880 --> 00:20:58.920]   shadow detail by almost 30%.
[00:20:58.920 --> 00:21:02.360]   I have heard that there's nothing Apple graphic designed apartment likes better than popping
[00:21:02.360 --> 00:21:06.160]   open an adult beverage after they send out an invite and just enjoying the internet crazy
[00:21:06.160 --> 00:21:07.160]   that follows.
[00:21:07.160 --> 00:21:08.160]   Oh, yeah.
[00:21:08.160 --> 00:21:09.160]   Just watching.
[00:21:09.160 --> 00:21:11.200]   Let's see what Apple they're doing right now.
[00:21:11.200 --> 00:21:15.160]   I hope you're enjoying that, Christal.
[00:21:15.160 --> 00:21:18.680]   So there are a couple of things you could say, maybe a new flash on the camera.
[00:21:18.680 --> 00:21:22.440]   But I think obviously it's new colors.
[00:21:22.440 --> 00:21:26.720]   And perhaps new, I mean, the iOS, you could say, is bright and colorful.
[00:21:26.720 --> 00:21:27.720]   Yeah.
[00:21:27.720 --> 00:21:30.240]   Yeah, I think they're going to coordinate it, aren't they?
[00:21:30.240 --> 00:21:31.520]   Because I think that's the whole thing.
[00:21:31.520 --> 00:21:36.080]   I think, you know, once you've got those plastic cases with the bright colors and the new iOS
[00:21:36.080 --> 00:21:40.680]   seven sort of color coordinated, I think I've even seen some screenshots where they've got
[00:21:40.680 --> 00:21:45.520]   in the packaging where they have the desktop or the home screen matching the case color
[00:21:45.520 --> 00:21:48.160]   and you're all the nice, brightly colored iOS seven icons.
[00:21:48.160 --> 00:21:50.480]   So yeah, there's going to be lots of colors.
[00:21:50.480 --> 00:21:54.400]   Take your sunglasses if you go in and because it's going to be very, very, very cool.
[00:21:54.400 --> 00:21:56.040]   You're flying out, right, Andy?
[00:21:56.040 --> 00:21:57.120]   I am indeed.
[00:21:57.120 --> 00:22:02.160]   So I thought that it would be a short walk from the Marriott to your Brubwaina center.
[00:22:02.160 --> 00:22:03.600]   It's actually Town Hall and Apple.
[00:22:03.600 --> 00:22:09.560]   So, so I understand that like there's a still big hippie culture in San Francisco.
[00:22:09.560 --> 00:22:11.640]   If I just stand a marker straight, I think you're going to ride.
[00:22:11.640 --> 00:22:12.640]   Yeah.
[00:22:12.640 --> 00:22:13.640]   Go in the town hall.
[00:22:13.640 --> 00:22:14.640]   Go in the town.
[00:22:14.640 --> 00:22:17.080]   So that's interesting because that's a very small venue.
[00:22:17.080 --> 00:22:18.640]   That's smaller than their Brubwaina center.
[00:22:18.640 --> 00:22:20.280]   Town Hall is just a few hundred people.
[00:22:20.280 --> 00:22:21.480]   150 or something.
[00:22:21.480 --> 00:22:22.480]   Yeah.
[00:22:22.480 --> 00:22:28.480]   So that means the idea of the four S event was these are very these are rare rarer than
[00:22:28.480 --> 00:22:32.400]   as my mother used to say rarer than hens teeth.
[00:22:32.400 --> 00:22:33.400]   These invitations.
[00:22:33.400 --> 00:22:37.880]   I'll let you think about that for a minute.
[00:22:37.880 --> 00:22:38.880]   So you're but that's good.
[00:22:38.880 --> 00:22:40.440]   That's exciting, Andy, that you're one of them.
[00:22:40.440 --> 00:22:41.600]   We will be doing our coverage.
[00:22:41.600 --> 00:22:42.760]   I do hope they stream.
[00:22:42.760 --> 00:22:44.280]   As you said, Don, I hope they stream again.
[00:22:44.280 --> 00:22:45.280]   They did it last time.
[00:22:45.280 --> 00:22:48.560]   Well, the problem was that the stream last time was in that big cinema.
[00:22:48.560 --> 00:22:51.000]   Wasn't it in it wasn't in the town hall.
[00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:52.480]   It was in a much nicer venue.
[00:22:52.480 --> 00:22:53.480]   That's right.
[00:22:53.480 --> 00:22:54.480]   Very large venue.
[00:22:54.480 --> 00:22:57.200]   I don't know what this streaming facilities are in Town Hall come to think of it.
[00:22:57.200 --> 00:22:58.920]   Have they ever streamed from Town Hall?
[00:22:58.920 --> 00:23:03.040]   They did not stream the iPhone 4S event.
[00:23:03.040 --> 00:23:08.840]   Whether they stream or not, we will be sitting around this table with our Mac experts.
[00:23:08.840 --> 00:23:12.400]   I think Scott Born has got agreed to join us for that on that.
[00:23:12.400 --> 00:23:13.400]   That'd be fun.
[00:23:13.400 --> 00:23:15.800]   I don't think he carries an iPhone after all this.
[00:23:15.800 --> 00:23:21.400]   Remember Scott, a regular as you remember, Andy on a Mac break weekly way back in 2007
[00:23:21.400 --> 00:23:26.080]   was the guy who was so hotly anticipating the first iPhone that some people said he
[00:23:26.080 --> 00:23:29.720]   had an iPhone vest made.
[00:23:29.720 --> 00:23:33.320]   Of course, there's a famous picture of him coming out of the Apple store in San Francisco
[00:23:33.320 --> 00:23:36.800]   with the first iPhone.
[00:23:36.800 --> 00:23:43.160]   He will be joining us, but I'm told he doesn't carry an iPhone anymore, which is.
[00:23:43.160 --> 00:23:44.160]   No puppets this time.
[00:23:44.160 --> 00:23:47.720]   I'm sorry, Dave, that you didn't enjoy the puppets last time.
[00:23:47.720 --> 00:23:50.680]   We thought the reason for the puppets was last time when there was no stream.
[00:23:50.680 --> 00:23:53.280]   We thought we'd do a reenactment, a recreation.
[00:23:53.280 --> 00:23:55.240]   A dramatic reading.
[00:23:55.240 --> 00:23:56.240]   Yeah.
[00:23:56.240 --> 00:23:57.240]   It was OK.
[00:23:57.240 --> 00:24:03.880]   But you know, high concept gets to be pulled all back and do radio theater.
[00:24:03.880 --> 00:24:04.880]   Yeah.
[00:24:04.880 --> 00:24:08.560]   So the fact that it's in the town hall, do you think that is sort of indicative of the
[00:24:08.560 --> 00:24:10.920]   fact that it is just the iPhone and nothing else?
[00:24:10.920 --> 00:24:13.120]   We probably will see another event in the weeks.
[00:24:13.120 --> 00:24:15.200]   I don't think you can read into that, can you?
[00:24:15.200 --> 00:24:19.640]   I think it was in town hall because they're doubling down on secrecy and they didn't want
[00:24:19.640 --> 00:24:23.080]   the event date to leak out when they booked your Bubuina Center.
[00:24:23.080 --> 00:24:25.040]   I don't know about that.
[00:24:25.040 --> 00:24:28.600]   I mean, at this point, it's kind of reliable that someone is going to get the date way
[00:24:28.600 --> 00:24:32.280]   before anybody else, which I don't think that Apple is resigned to that or even that
[00:24:32.280 --> 00:24:33.640]   they think that's a great thing.
[00:24:33.640 --> 00:24:40.160]   But although I will not even speculate as to why it's a town hall instead of downtown,
[00:24:40.160 --> 00:24:42.840]   I don't think it's because the date would have leaked.
[00:24:42.840 --> 00:24:47.680]   That was something that is as predictable as September new iPhone.
[00:24:47.680 --> 00:24:54.960]   If this were something like, gee, Apple hasn't had an announcement in three months and they
[00:24:54.960 --> 00:25:00.680]   already refreshed all the MacBook Airs and they would not release a new iPad three months
[00:25:00.680 --> 00:25:02.920]   after the last one.
[00:25:02.920 --> 00:25:03.920]   This could be a wristwatch.
[00:25:03.920 --> 00:25:08.760]   That would be the situation, which you'd think that I would read into it.
[00:25:08.760 --> 00:25:12.160]   As is, I'm just figuring out how to get from San Francisco.
[00:25:12.160 --> 00:25:16.360]   There's a nice train down there.
[00:25:16.360 --> 00:25:20.760]   Here's pictures leaking out of the 5C, which he does indeed.
[00:25:20.760 --> 00:25:21.760]   You know what it looks like?
[00:25:21.760 --> 00:25:24.720]   Somebody pointed out, it looks like an iPhone 5 in a case, in a colored case.
[00:25:24.720 --> 00:25:26.800]   That is basically what it is.
[00:25:26.800 --> 00:25:27.800]   Well, great.
[00:25:27.800 --> 00:25:28.800]   Wow.
[00:25:28.800 --> 00:25:29.800]   Now with the case built in.
[00:25:29.800 --> 00:25:32.760]   Well, I mean, it's a less expensive iPhone 5.
[00:25:32.760 --> 00:25:36.680]   Instead of being 650, it'll start around 450 and that'll be a big deal to some people.
[00:25:36.680 --> 00:25:39.720]   What will you give up for the lower price?
[00:25:39.720 --> 00:25:41.920]   The metal back, the aluminum uniball.
[00:25:41.920 --> 00:25:44.560]   You mean, the processor, you think it'll say in the screen?
[00:25:44.560 --> 00:25:46.960]   I think the last I heard, it's identical to the iPhone 5.
[00:25:46.960 --> 00:25:50.240]   It's just got the plastic back and they'll be able to manage faster.
[00:25:50.240 --> 00:25:51.240]   Any cost less?
[00:25:51.240 --> 00:25:52.240]   Yeah.
[00:25:52.240 --> 00:25:53.240]   What?
[00:25:53.240 --> 00:25:55.680]   Will it have the thumbprint reader or fingerprint reader?
[00:25:55.680 --> 00:25:56.680]   No.
[00:25:56.680 --> 00:25:59.080]   No, that's the other feature.
[00:25:59.080 --> 00:26:02.880]   You still believe in the fingerprint reader for the 5s?
[00:26:02.880 --> 00:26:06.600]   I believe it's been testing the bitchesis out of it and it seems, sounds like if they're
[00:26:06.600 --> 00:26:08.440]   still doing that, it's probably good to go.
[00:26:08.440 --> 00:26:12.040]   But, you know, they're the people who pulled the camera out of the iPod touch in the last
[00:26:12.040 --> 00:26:13.040]   minute.
[00:26:13.040 --> 00:26:15.840]   So I never take anything for granted till Phil Schiller holds it up on stage and tells
[00:26:15.840 --> 00:26:16.840]   me it's true.
[00:26:16.840 --> 00:26:20.960]   Rumors are, they're actually, they're arriving in the US already on the container ships.
[00:26:20.960 --> 00:26:23.560]   So I think it might be too late to pull up.
[00:26:23.560 --> 00:26:26.960]   By hand, by hand, they're pulling up.
[00:26:26.960 --> 00:26:31.680]   Oh, you know, they got that ship cap and the one that drinks that tipped over the cruise
[00:26:31.680 --> 00:26:35.360]   ship on the side just so they'll have to have an out just in case they decide that they
[00:26:35.360 --> 00:26:36.360]   want to, they'd rather have this.
[00:26:36.360 --> 00:26:37.840]   Oh, the boat sank.
[00:26:37.840 --> 00:26:40.120]   There aren't any.
[00:26:40.120 --> 00:26:43.560]   Shouldn't hire the poop ship captain.
[00:26:43.560 --> 00:26:47.160]   That guy's going to get a stern talking to you.
[00:26:47.160 --> 00:26:52.040]   So there you have it.
[00:26:52.040 --> 00:26:53.200]   I don't know what more to say.
[00:26:53.200 --> 00:27:00.200]   We've certainly talked ad nauseum and I use that phrase literally about all the features
[00:27:00.200 --> 00:27:02.320]   that it may or may not have.
[00:27:02.320 --> 00:27:04.880]   Gold is going to be it.
[00:27:04.880 --> 00:27:05.880]   I want gold.
[00:27:05.880 --> 00:27:07.360]   Maybe steel too.
[00:27:07.360 --> 00:27:08.360]   Maybe steel.
[00:27:08.360 --> 00:27:10.840]   Well, that's a great a steel graver.
[00:27:10.840 --> 00:27:14.360]   Black, white, gold and steel will still be actually made of steel.
[00:27:14.360 --> 00:27:20.000]   No, it'll be like a lighter color black, almost like a graphitey sort of a black and
[00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:21.000]   will be on the black.
[00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:26.280]   So the white and silver, white and gold, black and slate, black and graphitey steel
[00:27:26.280 --> 00:27:27.280]   colored.
[00:27:27.280 --> 00:27:31.000]   Is there any chance we should call it blue steel, somebody in the chair and said yes,
[00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:33.760]   to Japan, you're right, blue steel.
[00:27:33.760 --> 00:27:38.760]   Is there any chance now I forgot completely what I was going to say.
[00:27:38.760 --> 00:27:39.760]   Is there any chance?
[00:27:39.760 --> 00:27:40.760]   Is there any chance?
[00:27:40.760 --> 00:27:41.760]   Any chance at all?
[00:27:41.760 --> 00:27:43.800]   I don't know what I was going to say.
[00:27:43.800 --> 00:27:44.960]   Well, he tested the universe.
[00:27:44.960 --> 00:27:47.560]   So really, all of this is futile.
[00:27:47.560 --> 00:27:51.040]   We will not live long enough to see our own accomplishments reflected in the betterment
[00:27:51.040 --> 00:27:52.040]   of society.
[00:27:52.040 --> 00:27:54.520]   However, there is a core set of faith.
[00:27:54.520 --> 00:27:56.320]   Oh, I know what I was going to say.
[00:27:56.320 --> 00:27:57.320]   You are a believer.
[00:27:57.320 --> 00:27:58.320]   I'm going to.
[00:27:58.320 --> 00:27:59.320]   I'm sorry.
[00:27:59.320 --> 00:28:00.320]   Sorry, sorry.
[00:28:00.320 --> 00:28:01.320]   Go ahead.
[00:28:01.320 --> 00:28:03.880]   Whether you are a believer in God or not, that the daily struggle is a valid struggle and
[00:28:03.880 --> 00:28:08.920]   that even though you yourself will not reap the rewards of the good works that you do,
[00:28:08.920 --> 00:28:13.160]   the fact that you are contributing towards a positive vector for society makes the battle
[00:28:13.160 --> 00:28:14.160]   worthwhile.
[00:28:14.160 --> 00:28:20.400]   I'm just reading Ernest Becker's The Denial of Death right now and I beg to differ.
[00:28:20.400 --> 00:28:21.400]   It's all hopeless.
[00:28:21.400 --> 00:28:25.320]   What I was going to ask is there any chance there will be an iPod announcement at the
[00:28:25.320 --> 00:28:26.320]   same time?
[00:28:26.320 --> 00:28:30.000]   Isn't this traditional iPod announcement territory?
[00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:31.000]   There was last year.
[00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:32.840]   Last year in September, they did the iPhone and the iPod.
[00:28:32.840 --> 00:28:35.880]   The iPod value to Apple is lowering every year.
[00:28:35.880 --> 00:28:38.560]   They're selling less and less every year so they could throw it away in a press release
[00:28:38.560 --> 00:28:41.080]   or as an aside in a press conference.
[00:28:41.080 --> 00:28:44.360]   Is there any chance that dots will make it to Windows Phone?
[00:28:44.360 --> 00:28:46.920]   No, that's the wrong question.
[00:28:46.920 --> 00:28:47.920]   Instagram.
[00:28:47.920 --> 00:28:48.920]   Instagram.
[00:28:48.920 --> 00:28:49.920]   Instagram.
[00:28:49.920 --> 00:28:51.760]   So they could conceivably announce the iPods.
[00:28:51.760 --> 00:28:56.960]   It's like such a who cares thing but I guess somebody must buy them.
[00:28:56.960 --> 00:29:01.560]   And also let's not forget that it's nice to have an iOS device that is off contract
[00:29:01.560 --> 00:29:03.760]   and not as expensive as an iPad.
[00:29:03.760 --> 00:29:09.920]   So I think there will always be room for an iPod touch and there will always be it's
[00:29:09.920 --> 00:29:16.240]   it might sound ghost to talk about these things but the that Apple is an international prestige
[00:29:16.240 --> 00:29:20.560]   product and there always going to be some people who if they have room in their life
[00:29:20.560 --> 00:29:24.880]   or like a fitness player, you know, some of their their their their their using at the
[00:29:24.880 --> 00:29:28.040]   gym or something if they're in a high school team where they don't want necessarily risk
[00:29:28.040 --> 00:29:32.160]   having their $300 to your contract iPhone stolen out of a locker.
[00:29:32.160 --> 00:29:36.320]   If they're going to buy MP3 player or digital music player, wouldn't they like to have one
[00:29:36.320 --> 00:29:37.840]   with the sporty Apple logo on it?
[00:29:37.840 --> 00:29:41.360]   So it's not it's not it's so definitely it's importance is diminished but that doesn't
[00:29:41.360 --> 00:29:42.960]   mean that it's not important.
[00:29:42.960 --> 00:29:48.320]   I mean the other thing if you made the iPod touch a five S minus phone that might be you
[00:29:48.320 --> 00:29:52.200]   know, even with the fingerprint reader, there might be a market there with the original
[00:29:52.200 --> 00:29:55.960]   job the iPod touch was hired to do by Apple was to get people onto the app store.
[00:29:55.960 --> 00:29:58.120]   It was their gateway drug and it's diminishing it.
[00:29:58.120 --> 00:30:01.520]   They're selling less and less every year and it looks like the iPhone five part of the
[00:30:01.520 --> 00:30:04.480]   reason they're finally going ahead with the iPhone 5C, which is something that they've
[00:30:04.480 --> 00:30:09.560]   been playing around with since you know 2009 2010 is because the iPod touch is no longer
[00:30:09.560 --> 00:30:13.960]   as good at that as it used to be and people are going to cheap smartphones to get into
[00:30:13.960 --> 00:30:14.960]   the market now instead.
[00:30:14.960 --> 00:30:21.760]   So if Apple has a $450 iPhone 5C, which would work out to you know, close to free on contract
[00:30:21.760 --> 00:30:25.960]   and still relatively cheap by iPhone standards off contract or under these new plans where
[00:30:25.960 --> 00:30:29.920]   you pay off part of it every month, then that might pick up some of that gateway that used
[00:30:29.920 --> 00:30:31.920]   to be the iPod touch.
[00:30:31.920 --> 00:30:33.920]   It also I suppose.
[00:30:33.920 --> 00:30:34.920]   That's some problem.
[00:30:34.920 --> 00:30:35.920]   Yeah, I'm sorry.
[00:30:35.920 --> 00:30:36.920]   Go ahead.
[00:30:36.920 --> 00:30:38.920]   It's still it's still a phone in the end and I think they really do need you know, an
[00:30:38.920 --> 00:30:43.920]   iPhone form factor, but that's not phone and the iPod touch is it's perfect.
[00:30:43.920 --> 00:30:45.440]   I mean, I've been using the iPod.
[00:30:45.440 --> 00:30:49.280]   I mean, I'm not really a big iPod touch user, but since iOS 7 came out, I've been using
[00:30:49.280 --> 00:30:53.640]   the iPod touch as a device to test out some of the beaters.
[00:30:53.640 --> 00:30:55.680]   I'm really happy with it.
[00:30:55.680 --> 00:30:57.920]   It's a great device.
[00:30:57.920 --> 00:30:59.080]   It's so powerful.
[00:30:59.080 --> 00:31:01.920]   The the thinness as well is incredible in the iPod touch.
[00:31:01.920 --> 00:31:07.000]   So I still think that they're probably going to revamp this generation and you know, come
[00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:11.800]   out with an iPhone 5 version of the of the iPod touch.
[00:31:11.800 --> 00:31:14.440]   It's remote to see whether or not they'll keep the classic is this the year the classic
[00:31:14.440 --> 00:31:18.320]   will actually die to death or will they actually bring out a decent capacity in the iPod touch
[00:31:18.320 --> 00:31:19.880]   to replace the classic is another one.
[00:31:19.880 --> 00:31:22.280]   There's one twenty eight enough for you Don if you went to one twenty eight for the iPhone
[00:31:22.280 --> 00:31:25.200]   and iPod touch, would that be good enough to chuck the classic?
[00:31:25.200 --> 00:31:30.760]   Yeah, well, to be honest, my storage requirements have sort of gone down because I'm getting
[00:31:30.760 --> 00:31:35.760]   more and more into using sort of streaming and Spotify services, you know, so actually
[00:31:35.760 --> 00:31:40.000]   carrying my entire library around with me now I do, but I tend to do that now as a Spotify
[00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:43.400]   application with some key tracks sync to the device.
[00:31:43.400 --> 00:31:47.520]   But I'm sure we'll see a hundred and twenty eight device come out this year.
[00:31:47.520 --> 00:31:48.520]   Hopefully.
[00:31:48.520 --> 00:31:56.200]   I'll I'll share. I had a thought the other day that has totally ruined how I look at
[00:31:56.200 --> 00:32:01.120]   previous Tim Cook keynotes and is absolutely going to ruin how I look at next weeks.
[00:32:01.120 --> 00:32:02.120]   Oh, good.
[00:32:02.120 --> 00:32:03.120]   Ruined for all of us.
[00:32:03.120 --> 00:32:04.120]   It was going to be exactly.
[00:32:04.120 --> 00:32:05.960]   It was going to be ruined for me.
[00:32:05.960 --> 00:32:06.960]   It's something.
[00:32:06.960 --> 00:32:07.960]   Okay.
[00:32:07.960 --> 00:32:08.960]   Here's what occurred to me.
[00:32:08.960 --> 00:32:11.400]   He has been seen wearing a Fitbit.
[00:32:11.400 --> 00:32:12.400]   Okay.
[00:32:12.400 --> 00:32:14.600]   Yeah, this is in this is in the board.
[00:32:14.600 --> 00:32:15.600]   Isn't he?
[00:32:15.600 --> 00:32:16.600]   You're in the night.
[00:32:16.600 --> 00:32:17.600]   The few Nike fuel.
[00:32:17.600 --> 00:32:18.600]   Okay.
[00:32:18.600 --> 00:32:19.600]   I'm sorry.
[00:32:19.600 --> 00:32:20.600]   But these devices.
[00:32:20.600 --> 00:32:21.600]   Yes, he's on the fuel band board.
[00:32:21.600 --> 00:32:22.600]   Exactly.
[00:32:22.600 --> 00:32:23.600]   And not a vague device.
[00:32:23.600 --> 00:32:24.600]   It kind of looks like one.
[00:32:24.600 --> 00:32:25.600]   An actual one.
[00:32:25.600 --> 00:32:26.600]   Yeah.
[00:32:26.600 --> 00:32:27.600]   He wears a fuel.
[00:32:27.600 --> 00:32:28.600]   Yeah.
[00:32:28.600 --> 00:32:29.600]   So here here's what suddenly occurred to me.
[00:32:29.600 --> 00:32:33.320]   What if they have manufacturing stuff inside of Apple?
[00:32:33.320 --> 00:32:38.240]   What if he is actually testing Apple's new fitness watch hardware device things and they
[00:32:38.240 --> 00:32:43.880]   simply design hardware that would fit inside this thing so that he could wear it publicly
[00:32:43.880 --> 00:32:47.040]   and use it every day without everybody saying, Oh my God.
[00:32:47.040 --> 00:32:49.040]   Did you see what Ted Cook was wearing?
[00:32:49.040 --> 00:32:50.040]   Flash flash.
[00:32:50.040 --> 00:32:51.600]   I've got to kiss Moto this immediately.
[00:32:51.600 --> 00:32:58.120]   Again, I have no information about this, but considering how remember that the iPhone
[00:32:58.120 --> 00:33:03.120]   4 was first tested in the field disguised as an ordinary iPhone with the use of a case,
[00:33:03.120 --> 00:33:08.680]   it made me wonder if perhaps this is something interesting that has at least occurred to somebody
[00:33:08.680 --> 00:33:09.680]   inside.
[00:33:09.680 --> 00:33:13.920]   Brian hog puppet maker, would you please put a rubber thing around the puppet Tim Cook
[00:33:13.920 --> 00:33:14.920]   right now.
[00:33:14.920 --> 00:33:16.920]   Brian is walks into a bar.
[00:33:16.920 --> 00:33:19.520]   Yes, you're going to leave it there.
[00:33:19.520 --> 00:33:22.760]   So you're saying it's the I watch in a special fake.
[00:33:22.760 --> 00:33:24.200]   I don't know.
[00:33:24.200 --> 00:33:28.480]   I would say that there would be a long I'm guessing that there would be a long line of
[00:33:28.480 --> 00:33:32.000]   people who would want to be wearing this each and every day to get a sense of what the software
[00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:36.000]   should be of how well the hardware works, how reliable certain certain certain certain
[00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:41.640]   designs are and also how practical it is day to day is a collecting data that actually
[00:33:41.640 --> 00:33:48.320]   will sort of enable and empower somebody to change their to improve their fitness that
[00:33:48.320 --> 00:33:53.000]   this is by this is not the nature of this sort of device is not the sort of thing where
[00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:55.760]   they can keep it inside a laptop case and only use it in private.
[00:33:55.760 --> 00:33:59.560]   They would have to be wearing it 24 seven and unless they have one of those endoscopic
[00:33:59.560 --> 00:34:02.440]   pills sort of things, they could simply swallow it.
[00:34:02.440 --> 00:34:06.840]   They bought a company that does that you laugh, but they did buy a company that does
[00:34:06.840 --> 00:34:07.840]   that.
[00:34:07.840 --> 00:34:11.760]   It's one of those things that again, if you if you are alone in your house for several
[00:34:11.760 --> 00:34:15.600]   hours and this occurs to you, you find yourself taking out the brandy snifter, fill it with
[00:34:15.600 --> 00:34:20.960]   thy Dr. Peppery so you could swirl it as you sip and think and it occurs to me that perhaps
[00:34:20.960 --> 00:34:26.440]   at some point, if at some point there will be Apple employees out wearing these things
[00:34:26.440 --> 00:34:30.360]   disguised as other existing familiar exercise bands.
[00:34:30.360 --> 00:34:35.160]   You know what I heard that the Mac Pro, which we've all been thinking is this big is actually
[00:34:35.160 --> 00:34:38.040]   the size of a coffee mug.
[00:34:38.040 --> 00:34:42.520]   That's what I heard and you could carry it in your back pocket.
[00:34:42.520 --> 00:34:44.960]   I think not Andy, but good, good.
[00:34:44.960 --> 00:34:48.720]   We'll be one again, again, I'm not I'm not predicting it.
[00:34:48.720 --> 00:34:49.720]   I'm not saying it.
[00:34:49.720 --> 00:34:52.760]   I'm just saying that this is this is the idea that comes into your head and then it's sort
[00:34:52.760 --> 00:34:56.960]   of it's it's like the first time that you read online or someone says to you, okay, I'm
[00:34:56.960 --> 00:34:58.160]   going to blow your mind.
[00:34:58.160 --> 00:34:59.160]   Your mind should be ready.
[00:34:59.160 --> 00:35:06.200]   What if R2 D2 actually has access to the force because think about it sounds stupid, but
[00:35:06.200 --> 00:35:11.820]   he's doing all these things that seem really unlikely that how was he able to man to land
[00:35:11.820 --> 00:35:16.920]   that pod coincidentally within walking distance of of Ben Kenobi, the one person who would
[00:35:16.920 --> 00:35:19.400]   be able to use that information so well.
[00:35:19.400 --> 00:35:23.160]   How can it's like, oh, I know you're wrong, but now I'm thinking about this.
[00:35:23.160 --> 00:35:25.920]   You idiot, you've ruined my afternoon.
[00:35:25.920 --> 00:35:30.240]   I hate to interrupt, but I have to actually confirm Leo's Mac Pro rumor.
[00:35:30.240 --> 00:35:31.480]   It's actually here.
[00:35:31.480 --> 00:35:32.480]   Here it is.
[00:35:32.480 --> 00:35:33.480]   Look how small that is.
[00:35:33.480 --> 00:35:35.280]   The coffee cup, the new Mac Pro.
[00:35:35.280 --> 00:35:36.280]   It's that big.
[00:35:36.280 --> 00:35:37.280]   Mm hmm.
[00:35:37.280 --> 00:35:42.160]   It shrunk to a few jobs down to.
[00:35:42.160 --> 00:35:43.160]   What is that?
[00:35:43.160 --> 00:35:44.720]   Is that a Raspberry Pi in there?
[00:35:44.720 --> 00:35:47.840]   So it's a yeah, it's a one third scale.
[00:35:47.840 --> 00:35:48.840]   That's cool.
[00:35:48.840 --> 00:35:50.400]   Macintosh and it actually works.
[00:35:50.400 --> 00:35:56.840]   So for folks listening, it's the form factor of the 128 Mac, the original Mac, but inside
[00:35:56.840 --> 00:35:57.920]   is a computer.
[00:35:57.920 --> 00:35:58.920]   Mm hmm.
[00:35:58.920 --> 00:35:59.920]   And it's what about the size?
[00:35:59.920 --> 00:36:02.800]   It looks doesn't look much bigger than a Superball.
[00:36:02.800 --> 00:36:03.800]   I don't know.
[00:36:03.800 --> 00:36:04.800]   I don't know what's that size.
[00:36:04.800 --> 00:36:05.800]   Three inches tall.
[00:36:05.800 --> 00:36:06.800]   Three inches tall.
[00:36:06.800 --> 00:36:07.800]   Wow.
[00:36:07.800 --> 00:36:08.800]   That's really cool.
[00:36:08.800 --> 00:36:09.800]   I'd love to get that.
[00:36:09.800 --> 00:36:10.800]   Can you run a web server on it?
[00:36:10.800 --> 00:36:11.800]   I'm sure you could.
[00:36:11.800 --> 00:36:12.800]   I'm sure you could.
[00:36:12.800 --> 00:36:13.800]   It's probably good.
[00:36:13.800 --> 00:36:14.800]   Raspberry Pi.
[00:36:14.800 --> 00:36:15.800]   Yeah.
[00:36:15.800 --> 00:36:16.800]   Yeah.
[00:36:16.800 --> 00:36:24.040]   I, we're saying a lot of this stuff and I think in a way this is our nervous whistling
[00:36:24.040 --> 00:36:32.480]   past the graveyard in response to our fears that Apple in fact doesn't have anything mind
[00:36:32.480 --> 00:36:33.760]   buckling.
[00:36:33.760 --> 00:36:38.280]   That everything they're going to do is going to be basically evolutionary and maybe, maybe
[00:36:38.280 --> 00:36:43.440]   of interest to a consumer audience but not enough for us.
[00:36:43.440 --> 00:36:49.400]   Maybe tech journalists to jump up and down and say, see they did it again.
[00:36:49.400 --> 00:36:50.400]   Isn't that the fear Andy?
[00:36:50.400 --> 00:36:52.880]   Come on, admit it.
[00:36:52.880 --> 00:36:55.480]   I really don't know.
[00:36:55.480 --> 00:37:01.440]   I don't think that a real tech journalist is going to be saying stuff like that.
[00:37:01.440 --> 00:37:03.640]   No, I know it, but I am saying.
[00:37:03.640 --> 00:37:04.640]   And I am.
[00:37:04.640 --> 00:37:09.520]   I really feel that that what's happening here is this nervousness that Apple's lost
[00:37:09.520 --> 00:37:10.520]   is Mojo.
[00:37:10.520 --> 00:37:16.040]   And we're really hoping that a week from today, the Mojo will be back.
[00:37:16.040 --> 00:37:20.440]   I think that Apple is definitely in ZFG mode on that issue.
[00:37:20.440 --> 00:37:23.120]   Zero field group.
[00:37:23.120 --> 00:37:24.120]   Zero dams given.
[00:37:24.120 --> 00:37:25.120]   ZG.
[00:37:25.120 --> 00:37:29.520]   I might be, I might mean something else that I don't think it does.
[00:37:29.520 --> 00:37:30.520]   No, I agree.
[00:37:30.520 --> 00:37:31.520]   I agree.
[00:37:31.520 --> 00:37:33.600]   If you're the company, if you're the company, you're not saying, hey, what can we do to
[00:37:33.600 --> 00:37:34.840]   blow people socks off?
[00:37:34.840 --> 00:37:37.680]   You're saying let's just keep making great stuff.
[00:37:37.680 --> 00:37:38.680]   Fine.
[00:37:38.680 --> 00:37:39.680]   I'm saying that.
[00:37:39.680 --> 00:37:45.720]   There are bloggers and even some journalists who are going to say stuff like that.
[00:37:45.720 --> 00:37:47.160]   And that's one side of the argument.
[00:37:47.160 --> 00:37:52.840]   At the other side of the argument is everything that Apple has done even over the past two
[00:37:52.840 --> 00:37:53.840]   years.
[00:37:53.840 --> 00:37:59.480]   And if the iPhone 5 was not banana-shaped as someone would have hoped to see it that
[00:37:59.480 --> 00:38:02.880]   way, it's still a fantastic phone with a lot of great stuff on the inside.
[00:38:02.880 --> 00:38:07.600]   And the fact that it is still amazingly popular, the fact that even the fact that their older
[00:38:07.600 --> 00:38:11.200]   phones are still amazingly popular means that they are still producing products that
[00:38:11.200 --> 00:38:13.680]   people absolutely are responding to.
[00:38:13.680 --> 00:38:20.240]   So it's like at some point, the space shuttle takes off and it's explosive and it's exciting.
[00:38:20.240 --> 00:38:22.640]   There's a rumble you can feel in your chest.
[00:38:22.640 --> 00:38:27.080]   At some point you reach Earth orbit and then you start doing wonderful work.
[00:38:27.080 --> 00:38:32.000]   The fact that there's no longer a mile long jet of flame and smoke behind you and that
[00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:35.080]   rumble in your chest doesn't mean that they're not doing wonderful things.
[00:38:35.080 --> 00:38:38.680]   So I think that Apple is certainly mature enough and they're certainly successful enough to
[00:38:38.680 --> 00:38:42.880]   say there are people who are going to be saying that stuff, let them say that stuff because
[00:38:42.880 --> 00:38:47.960]   each and every month that we aspire to excellence and reach it makes that comment seem even
[00:38:47.960 --> 00:38:48.960]   more silly.
[00:38:48.960 --> 00:38:54.680]   Yeah, I mean I'd have to say that as well that I mean basically if they don't come out
[00:38:54.680 --> 00:38:58.880]   with something mind-boggling next month and the likelihood is or rather than 10 days or
[00:38:58.880 --> 00:39:02.520]   when the next event is, the likelihood is that they won't.
[00:39:02.520 --> 00:39:05.040]   They're going to get a lot of pain.
[00:39:05.040 --> 00:39:07.800]   A lot of pain from tech bloggers, a lot of pain from the tech press, a lot of pain from
[00:39:07.800 --> 00:39:11.040]   Wall Street but it won't affect Apple's products.
[00:39:11.040 --> 00:39:12.400]   They will carry on making the products.
[00:39:12.400 --> 00:39:16.280]   They will still continue to sell the products and they'll still sort of, they'll still
[00:39:16.280 --> 00:39:18.360]   move forward, they still have the momentum.
[00:39:18.360 --> 00:39:23.880]   And then when the next big thing is ready, however long it takes, then all fears will
[00:39:23.880 --> 00:39:25.960]   be dispelled but they will.
[00:39:25.960 --> 00:39:28.560]   And I think they're quite used to sucking up that pain now because they get it every
[00:39:28.560 --> 00:39:32.160]   time there's an announcement that people are complaining they've lost the mojo but they
[00:39:32.160 --> 00:39:36.640]   still keep, you know, plugging on creating, innovating and creating new products.
[00:39:36.640 --> 00:39:41.760]   And the bottom line is that people still enjoy the products and still are buying them.
[00:39:41.760 --> 00:39:45.520]   It's really just Wall Street and the tech press that gives them a hard time over I think.
[00:39:45.520 --> 00:39:46.520]   I disagree.
[00:39:46.520 --> 00:39:49.360]   I think that there is a thing called momentum.
[00:39:49.360 --> 00:39:54.320]   And we saw this happen with Microsoft for five years people including myself and saying
[00:39:54.320 --> 00:39:57.520]   Microsoft is really going on a downhill slide.
[00:39:57.520 --> 00:39:58.520]   It takes a while.
[00:39:58.520 --> 00:39:59.720]   Microsoft's still making a lot of money.
[00:39:59.720 --> 00:40:02.040]   It means a dollar is every quarter.
[00:40:02.040 --> 00:40:07.240]   But that's not really what we're reporting on.
[00:40:07.240 --> 00:40:12.040]   We're reporting, you know, on momentum on the future and on my on mind share.
[00:40:12.040 --> 00:40:15.680]   I don't think Apple's going to lose market share in any near term future.
[00:40:15.680 --> 00:40:19.600]   Well, they are a little bit to Android but I don't think that there's there's any reason
[00:40:19.600 --> 00:40:21.080]   to start bailing out the boat.
[00:40:21.080 --> 00:40:27.280]   But at the same time, it's I don't know if I'm seeing innovation come out of my Apple.
[00:40:27.280 --> 00:40:28.280]   Are you?
[00:40:28.280 --> 00:40:29.520]   Well, yeah, I like what are you missing?
[00:40:29.520 --> 00:40:30.520]   What could they announce?
[00:40:30.520 --> 00:40:33.120]   What would you rather that they announced this time?
[00:40:33.120 --> 00:40:38.440]   Well, not I mean, I guess a fingerprint reader is innovation.
[00:40:38.440 --> 00:40:40.600]   If people jump on it, I don't think they will.
[00:40:40.600 --> 00:40:43.160]   When the iPad came out, people said it was boring and on a map.
[00:40:43.160 --> 00:40:47.520]   I was very clear that the iPad was a massive step forward and I took a lot of heat for
[00:40:47.520 --> 00:40:49.080]   it from a lot of people said, oh, you're crazy.
[00:40:49.080 --> 00:40:50.160]   You were right.
[00:40:50.160 --> 00:40:51.160]   I was right.
[00:40:51.160 --> 00:40:53.080]   I don't see that in the future for Apple.
[00:40:53.080 --> 00:40:56.120]   I don't, you know, I don't think a watcher TV is going to do it.
[00:40:56.120 --> 00:40:57.120]   Maybe a watch will.
[00:40:57.120 --> 00:41:00.120]   But I don't think anything they're going to announce in a week is going to make any difference
[00:41:00.120 --> 00:41:01.120]   to people.
[00:41:01.120 --> 00:41:03.720]   And I think they're going to continue to lose market share.
[00:41:03.720 --> 00:41:06.440]   My question is what would I mean, people say that.
[00:41:06.440 --> 00:41:07.440]   Well, I agree.
[00:41:07.440 --> 00:41:12.520]   I don't know what would, but certainly a 4.7 inch phone is not it.
[00:41:12.520 --> 00:41:16.040]   But this isn't the right time for them to do a larger screen phone.
[00:41:16.040 --> 00:41:17.200]   That's a problem for them.
[00:41:17.200 --> 00:41:20.240]   That's their that's their cycle that they determine and that's a problem.
[00:41:20.240 --> 00:41:23.080]   Yes, but that's not that's not a failure.
[00:41:23.080 --> 00:41:25.480]   There's a difference between a problem and a failure.
[00:41:25.480 --> 00:41:32.000]   And again, if so long as Apple introduces change at a rate slightly but not disruptively
[00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:35.040]   faster than its users want, they're doing fine.
[00:41:35.040 --> 00:41:40.720]   I think that if Iowa seven, I think is a big enough change for toward 2013.
[00:41:40.720 --> 00:41:46.480]   I really think that's very, very true that they are as they are.
[00:41:46.480 --> 00:41:53.000]   They are not it's over it's overkill to say that they are rebooting iOS from scratch,
[00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:56.120]   but not that far of a stretch.
[00:41:56.120 --> 00:42:01.200]   The reaction that developers have had and these are not normal users who only expect
[00:42:01.200 --> 00:42:02.360]   a consumer experience.
[00:42:02.360 --> 00:42:05.880]   They are people who are kind of they have their minds open to change have been saying
[00:42:05.880 --> 00:42:09.760]   nasty things about it and how much how confused they are about things.
[00:42:09.760 --> 00:42:12.600]   They're going to have their hands full and making sure that they sell the idea of here
[00:42:12.600 --> 00:42:16.320]   is everything that you're going to get with iOS seven where you're going to get two or
[00:42:16.320 --> 00:42:18.280]   three weeks worth of pain for sure.
[00:42:18.280 --> 00:42:22.160]   But at some point you will get used to the fact that doesn't work like the old thing.
[00:42:22.160 --> 00:42:25.080]   And some of the new things work much better than anything you ever had.
[00:42:25.080 --> 00:42:27.840]   And then you will completely forget about those two or three weeks.
[00:42:27.840 --> 00:42:33.760]   All I'm saying is that Apple's product line does not exist for our entertainment.
[00:42:33.760 --> 00:42:36.640]   It's wonder I mean, do they want to be Samsung?
[00:42:36.640 --> 00:42:37.880]   Do they want to come up a lot?
[00:42:37.880 --> 00:42:39.280]   That's the wrong way to go to exactly.
[00:42:39.280 --> 00:42:40.280]   Yeah.
[00:42:40.280 --> 00:42:42.840]   Do they want to come up with well we have a six point one inch phone now we're going to
[00:42:42.840 --> 00:42:47.720]   try a five point eight five inch phone just just because we so and bought a pair of slacks
[00:42:47.720 --> 00:42:52.200]   the banana Republican complain that they couldn't fit the their their new note mini
[00:42:52.200 --> 00:42:53.200]   inside this.
[00:42:53.200 --> 00:42:55.480]   We're going to make one just for that style of pants.
[00:42:55.480 --> 00:42:56.680]   I think Apple is doing okay.
[00:42:56.680 --> 00:43:03.400]   I think that they have to go a number of a couple of years or two or three years without
[00:43:03.400 --> 00:43:07.880]   having made steps forward in order for that kind of a complaint to stick.
[00:43:07.880 --> 00:43:13.480]   So again, it's not as entertaining if we see a new phone that has incredibly improved
[00:43:13.480 --> 00:43:18.560]   internals much faster and a better camera but looks a lot like the one we had last year.
[00:43:18.560 --> 00:43:19.880]   It's okay if that happens.
[00:43:19.880 --> 00:43:21.880]   It's not it we again, I would love to see a watch.
[00:43:21.880 --> 00:43:23.280]   I would love to see a TV.
[00:43:23.280 --> 00:43:24.720]   I would love to see all kinds of things.
[00:43:24.720 --> 00:43:26.960]   I'd love to see a self driving car.
[00:43:26.960 --> 00:43:30.760]   But again, that's those are things that entertain me as someone who is a lover of technology
[00:43:30.760 --> 00:43:32.200]   and who loves falling technology.
[00:43:32.200 --> 00:43:34.560]   There's I think you're doing me this service.
[00:43:34.560 --> 00:43:36.720]   I am not asking for entertainment.
[00:43:36.720 --> 00:43:40.640]   I really am asking Apple what is the innovation you're going to come up with it.
[00:43:40.640 --> 00:43:44.880]   And is it plastic colored backs, a fingerprint reader, nobody uses because you're not going
[00:43:44.880 --> 00:43:46.360]   to do the services that work.
[00:43:46.360 --> 00:43:49.000]   I guarantee you with it.
[00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:55.760]   I think that they need to innovate and I think that otherwise they're just as you said, okay,
[00:43:55.760 --> 00:43:56.760]   but just okay.
[00:43:56.760 --> 00:43:58.960]   It's not the Apple that we've had for the last 20 years.
[00:43:58.960 --> 00:44:02.680]   If I've done you if I've done you the service by missing some of the entertainment Andy,
[00:44:02.680 --> 00:44:07.360]   I'm asking what is Apple going to do to innovate because if they don't, they're going to lose
[00:44:07.360 --> 00:44:08.520]   this race.
[00:44:08.520 --> 00:44:11.000]   You cannot just chug along in this race.
[00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:14.040]   This is a race where people are really truly innovating.
[00:44:14.040 --> 00:44:15.200]   Also, also very true.
[00:44:15.200 --> 00:44:18.760]   But there are a couple of words that I'm I wouldn't say sick and tired of hearing associated
[00:44:18.760 --> 00:44:21.240]   with Apple, but I think they're given way, way too much importance.
[00:44:21.240 --> 00:44:24.120]   You hear the word innovation, you hear the word disruption.
[00:44:24.120 --> 00:44:28.720]   And if they're not innovating or disruption, disrupting, they're not doing a good job.
[00:44:28.720 --> 00:44:34.920]   Something that that is part of the of the matrix of what you need to be to be a powerful
[00:44:34.920 --> 00:44:35.920]   company.
[00:44:35.920 --> 00:44:40.340]   It's about a company that has the ability to control its own destiny and also affect the
[00:44:40.340 --> 00:44:44.640]   destiny of other companies by putting things out on the market that totally changed the
[00:44:44.640 --> 00:44:45.800]   landscape.
[00:44:45.800 --> 00:44:48.160]   I think Apple's coasting on its ecosystem.
[00:44:48.160 --> 00:44:49.160]   They're not.
[00:44:49.160 --> 00:44:50.560]   I think they feel that people have we got them locked in.
[00:44:50.560 --> 00:44:51.560]   We're going to coast on our ecosystem.
[00:44:51.560 --> 00:44:56.040]   And it's not entirely their choice because they've set themselves up to this low cycle.
[00:44:56.040 --> 00:44:57.400]   Any evidence of coasting.
[00:44:57.400 --> 00:45:02.560]   I have to respect respectfully disagree that they with that as soon as Apple comes up with
[00:45:02.560 --> 00:45:06.600]   something that's brand new that we really haven't seen before, then everybody will forget that
[00:45:06.600 --> 00:45:10.760]   they rested on their laurels laurels for a couple of years.
[00:45:10.760 --> 00:45:14.720]   It's going what's going to happen is that people are going to look back and realize that
[00:45:14.720 --> 00:45:19.440]   they do lots of work, consider lots of things all the time, not all of them make sense for
[00:45:19.440 --> 00:45:24.560]   fall of 2013 because other components that only Apple has really considered or Apple
[00:45:24.560 --> 00:45:27.680]   it really cares about have been factored into that decision.
[00:45:27.680 --> 00:45:32.320]   So I don't there's I don't believe that they've been coasting.
[00:45:32.320 --> 00:45:37.400]   I don't I think that the I also I do agree that I think that they see the value of lock
[00:45:37.400 --> 00:45:43.360]   in that that if they make the platform more attractive number one but also more difficult
[00:45:43.360 --> 00:45:46.400]   to switch away from that's something that benefits them in the long run.
[00:45:46.400 --> 00:45:52.000]   But I think they have they have they have seen this movie so many times before played
[00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:58.720]   with so many other actors like like Blackberry like Microsoft like palm in the starring role.
[00:45:58.720 --> 00:46:02.800]   They know what happens if they simply count on their existing market continuing to be
[00:46:02.800 --> 00:46:06.680]   happy with what they're doing and continuing to be resistant to changing to something that's
[00:46:06.680 --> 00:46:07.760]   newer and better.
[00:46:07.760 --> 00:46:11.560]   I do not believe that Apple would ever allow themselves to coast in that manner.
[00:46:11.560 --> 00:46:12.560]   That's just my opinion.
[00:46:12.560 --> 00:46:14.320]   Yeah, I think you both have early valid points.
[00:46:14.320 --> 00:46:17.800]   I think you know Andy's giving the rational argument and I'm in love with Andy's argument
[00:46:17.800 --> 00:46:21.440]   and it's one I wish I could make as you know as well as he does but Leo I think you're
[00:46:21.440 --> 00:46:25.320]   absolutely nailing a common perception and perception for a lot of people is reality
[00:46:25.320 --> 00:46:29.400]   and there's definitely a market perception that Apple Apple is not enjoying the market
[00:46:29.400 --> 00:46:33.600]   gratitude that it used to be getting and I also don't think people inside Apple are
[00:46:33.600 --> 00:46:34.720]   completely unaware of that.
[00:46:34.720 --> 00:46:37.800]   I think they're absolutely aware of that and that's why I wrote that article about the
[00:46:37.800 --> 00:46:40.880]   iPhone 5s problem earlier in this year.
[00:46:40.880 --> 00:46:43.720]   But the reason I asked a question about what would you see them do is I think that there
[00:46:43.720 --> 00:46:47.760]   is there are a lot of people who are saying Apple's not innovating and Apple is not moving
[00:46:47.760 --> 00:46:51.680]   fast enough but when you ask them it's like that famous you know what President Bartlett
[00:46:51.680 --> 00:46:53.960]   what are the next 10 words.
[00:46:53.960 --> 00:46:56.640]   No one really knows what they want to see next because the watch isn't big enough.
[00:46:56.640 --> 00:46:57.960]   The car is not really attainable.
[00:46:57.960 --> 00:47:00.080]   The TV doesn't seem quite right.
[00:47:00.080 --> 00:47:03.640]   Mobile is right now the present and the future and they've already done their big phone and
[00:47:03.640 --> 00:47:07.240]   tablet plays there and Apple's going to be doing the same thing they did with the Mac
[00:47:07.240 --> 00:47:11.400]   and that is incremental increases until the market is ready or till they determine there's
[00:47:11.400 --> 00:47:15.960]   a go to market strategy for the watch and for the TV set and I think you know to Andy's
[00:47:15.960 --> 00:47:21.960]   point they're just going to have to put up with the public sentiment that people aren't
[00:47:21.960 --> 00:47:25.720]   as happy with them or don't believe there is innovative anymore as they could be while
[00:47:25.720 --> 00:47:30.040]   still putting out fantastic products that are more evolutionary.
[00:47:30.040 --> 00:47:31.960]   Yeah your turn your turn your turn done.
[00:47:31.960 --> 00:47:35.640]   Right I was going to say I think Apple are constrained as well.
[00:47:35.640 --> 00:47:39.800]   They have the technology and you know they could quite easily develop a phone with a
[00:47:39.800 --> 00:47:44.080]   bigger screen they could do lots of things and have a product out to market very very
[00:47:44.080 --> 00:47:49.800]   quickly but they're constrained by timing and I think they really and it's one of the major
[00:47:49.800 --> 00:47:56.200]   factors that guides their product launches is the timing of when a product comes out and
[00:47:56.200 --> 00:48:01.680]   just hitting that sort of perfect storm of getting everything in place and you know just
[00:48:01.680 --> 00:48:05.800]   not creating a product for the product's sake but creating a product that they know people
[00:48:05.800 --> 00:48:10.360]   will you know need at that time and that might be you know the wearable device I know we call
[00:48:10.360 --> 00:48:15.480]   it a watch button just call it a wearable device it might not be until you know the summer
[00:48:15.480 --> 00:48:19.240]   of next year when they've got everything all the ducks in a row and the infrastructure
[00:48:19.240 --> 00:48:23.000]   in place and they've got the metrics in place that they want to measure and they've got the
[00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:27.080]   software written and you know it's only at that time when everything comes together and when the
[00:48:27.080 --> 00:48:30.920]   market is right for that particular product that they will actually release it and this is why
[00:48:30.920 --> 00:48:35.160]   you know we don't see although we see incremental innovation in the existing products that's why
[00:48:35.160 --> 00:48:39.800]   we don't see these huge product launches of brand new platforms and brand new products like we saw
[00:48:39.800 --> 00:48:45.400]   with the iPad you know every year it's every three or four years when you know they spend time
[00:48:45.400 --> 00:48:49.480]   to actually get the product right but crucially to get the timing right as well because that's
[00:48:49.480 --> 00:48:55.320]   so critical and also don't forget as well with Apple is that they're also constrained by volume
[00:48:55.320 --> 00:48:59.560]   in that any product that they sell they're going to have to ship in huge volumes so this is the
[00:48:59.560 --> 00:49:04.120]   whole product and manufacturing and Q&A and everything they've got to get in place before they can
[00:49:04.120 --> 00:49:11.400]   launch a product so it's all this you know carefully considered well thought out very cautious approach
[00:49:11.400 --> 00:49:15.800]   to product launches so that they know that the product will actually be a success yeah no I
[00:49:15.800 --> 00:49:20.200]   agree they have a lot of constraints and it all sounds like apologetics when it comes down to
[00:49:20.200 --> 00:49:24.920]   what are they doing about it they're they're in a very constrained situation
[00:49:24.920 --> 00:49:31.320]   and so is that going to be the reason that they don't do anything interesting because well
[00:49:31.320 --> 00:49:35.960]   we can't because you know McDonald's has a hard time announcing a new hamburger because they sell
[00:49:35.960 --> 00:49:40.920]   so much that they can use all the beef available in the United States so that's it that you're
[00:49:40.920 --> 00:49:45.480]   right that's a constraint you know there's lots of constraints their timetable they set themselves
[00:49:45.480 --> 00:49:50.040]   is a constraint there's there's also I don't think they've ever been under as much pressure
[00:49:50.040 --> 00:49:56.040]   from competition as they have in 2013 because I agree that's the problem now now you we're
[00:49:56.040 --> 00:50:00.360]   asked last year a year before we could have an argument over whether or not the iPhone was
[00:50:00.360 --> 00:50:05.240]   still the best phone in the market now you kind of sounds stupid if you if you if you if you express
[00:50:05.240 --> 00:50:08.760]   that not as an opinion but as a fact because there's so many other great phones out there
[00:50:08.760 --> 00:50:16.520]   also now apple is about to not necessarily lose the the macbook air supremacy but now that we have
[00:50:16.520 --> 00:50:21.480]   the has well processors that bring much most of the missing features from ultra books that were
[00:50:21.480 --> 00:50:26.520]   one time only present in the macbook air now you can get ultra long battery life really great power
[00:50:26.520 --> 00:50:31.080]   cool running on a device that costs maybe five or six hundred dollars or six or seven hundred
[00:50:31.080 --> 00:50:35.560]   dollars instead of a thousand to thirteen hundred dollars so apples just never had a company other
[00:50:35.560 --> 00:50:39.480]   companies nipping at their heels in so many categories as they happen 2013 and this
[00:50:39.480 --> 00:50:45.880]   above anything else is why I don't think that apple is going to stop trying to find the next big
[00:50:45.880 --> 00:50:49.720]   thing that or rather the next big thing that makes complete sense for the apple product line
[00:50:49.720 --> 00:50:51.880]   I mean god knows they have a lot of cash
[00:50:51.880 --> 00:50:58.680]   they have the resources there is a there does seem to be and I hear this apology made a lot
[00:50:58.680 --> 00:51:02.840]   there aren't enough engineers apple doesn't seem to be able to work on more than one product at the
[00:51:02.840 --> 00:51:07.560]   time i don't know factories anymore Leo not factories they're running out of factory but
[00:51:07.560 --> 00:51:12.520]   yeah but if you're an engineer who do you go to work for these days if you come and add a college
[00:51:12.520 --> 00:51:16.600]   and you're brilliant you're one of the top five programmers in the country do you go to apple do
[00:51:16.600 --> 00:51:21.480]   you go to google do you go to facebook do you go to microsoft yes i was going to say start up
[00:51:21.480 --> 00:51:25.320]   i think that most that most of the people that most of the people that i know that are out of
[00:51:25.320 --> 00:51:29.720]   college their first three or four years of their careers as engineers are freelancing right that
[00:51:29.720 --> 00:51:34.280]   they they they they're not of course they're not averse to getting that wonderful uh the folder
[00:51:34.280 --> 00:51:38.200]   from google with the with the offer letter but mostly they are working on four different projects
[00:51:38.200 --> 00:51:43.160]   each of which tickle different parts of their engineers uh soul so there's another constraint
[00:51:43.160 --> 00:51:47.080]   you're not getting the brightest minds yeah you buy the company that has the brightest minds Leo
[00:51:47.080 --> 00:51:53.080]   like algo trim what is what is they do mobile media and data compression this is another apple apple's
[00:51:53.080 --> 00:51:57.320]   been doing little acquisitions every week another one what does algo trim do
[00:51:57.320 --> 00:52:05.000]   anybody anybody anybody it's a squeeze firm those those inflatable exercise pants that
[00:52:05.000 --> 00:52:11.560]   no they made out of algae uh it this you know it could be an aquire where you're getting brains
[00:52:11.560 --> 00:52:16.280]   engineering talent this is by the way why companies like apple buy companies like algo trim because
[00:52:16.280 --> 00:52:20.760]   the smart kids come out of college they do a startup and then google or facebook or apple comes
[00:52:20.760 --> 00:52:24.280]   along and says it will buy that company not for the product we don't care about the product
[00:52:24.280 --> 00:52:30.040]   for the people like n_f_a_ draft yeah this is like only with better knees
[00:52:30.040 --> 00:52:36.120]   you don't have you don't have to have an MRI before you get to get recruited by google
[00:52:36.120 --> 00:52:42.040]   and maybe this is a measure of uh success apple is the company most targeted by patent trolls
[00:52:42.040 --> 00:52:48.040]   yeah um i don't know if that's a that might be a lagging indicator trailing indicator might be a
[00:52:48.040 --> 00:52:53.960]   size of bank account indicator we got the cash why do you rob banks because that's where the money is
[00:52:53.960 --> 00:52:58.440]   is what you know throw yourself in front of a 1989 Toyota you throw yourself in front of a
[00:52:58.440 --> 00:53:06.280]   2012 m4 m5 rather uh apple's i-foed training program what do you think about that they've
[00:53:06.280 --> 00:53:12.440]   they've decided they're they're trailing it right now to let you trade in your old iphone and get a
[00:53:12.440 --> 00:53:17.080]   pretty decent amount of cash it's i'm looking at that some charts done by a variety of different
[00:53:17.080 --> 00:53:23.800]   uh groups and it looks like the cash amount is somewhat uh comparable to say uh gazelle or somebody
[00:53:23.800 --> 00:53:32.360]   like that here's let me uh close the ad on cnbc so for a 16 gig iphone five amazon give you 389.50
[00:53:32.360 --> 00:53:43.480]   apple give you 336 gazelle 330 radio shack 300 verizon of course 259 uh let's go let's go farther
[00:53:43.480 --> 00:53:49.320]   back let's go an iphone four not even a 4s apple is uh offering if it's in perfect condition
[00:53:49.320 --> 00:53:55.560]   151 dollars you could uh i-is amazon they're they're giving a gift card not money but they're
[00:53:55.560 --> 00:54:01.560]   offering 200 gazelle 135 i guess there's it there's a certain similarity all these numbers except
[00:54:01.560 --> 00:54:08.200]   for the price you have to buy a new iphone and apple store though it's it's a trade-in yeah yeah
[00:54:08.840 --> 00:54:13.960]   so it's not really interesting to get cash back the really interesting thing for about this to
[00:54:13.960 --> 00:54:17.240]   me is it ties into everything you were saying before leo and that apple you know they're
[00:54:17.240 --> 00:54:21.240]   they made the iphone and for a long time they established the iphone their primary business
[00:54:21.240 --> 00:54:25.240]   now they're doing an iphone five c because just like the ipad mini for some people
[00:54:25.240 --> 00:54:28.600]   there's a maximum price they're willing to pay and apple won't make a cheap iphone but they'll
[00:54:28.600 --> 00:54:32.920]   make a less expensive one and then theoretically next year they'll make a larger screen iphone
[00:54:32.920 --> 00:54:37.400]   for people in emerging markets who only have one device and need something bigger than a phone but
[00:54:37.400 --> 00:54:41.640]   you know need a phone more than a tablet but there's still this huge umbrella underneath that in the
[00:54:41.640 --> 00:54:46.680]   ipod line the shuffle and the nano filled and apple's not going to make a shuffle or a nano phone
[00:54:46.680 --> 00:54:51.080]   but what they can do is do these refurbished phones and sell them in emerging markets and to lower
[00:54:51.080 --> 00:54:56.440]   end markets and to you know post prepaid phone markets and then they've covered the entire spectrum
[00:54:56.440 --> 00:55:00.920]   with ios devices and i think you know a lot of companies from carriers to apple are getting
[00:55:00.920 --> 00:55:05.880]   really interested in the second hand market yeah that doesn't that sounds that sounds like really
[00:55:05.880 --> 00:55:10.040]   smart and also sounds as though apple is really looking carefully at all the places where they
[00:55:10.040 --> 00:55:14.520]   think that in the iphone where they feel as though they're leaving money on the table and there if
[00:55:14.520 --> 00:55:18.360]   someone buys a cheaper android phone that doesn't work quite so well instead of an iphone they're
[00:55:18.360 --> 00:55:25.560]   leaving then apple's leaving money on the table if a second hand market lets them put products
[00:55:25.560 --> 00:55:30.920]   in hands of people that would normally not go for a more traditional product line then that's also
[00:55:30.920 --> 00:55:35.000]   money they're leaving on the table so it seems as though they're really trying to fine tune the
[00:55:35.000 --> 00:55:40.840]   business of making sure that making making the iphone as ubiquitous as a coke or a big mac
[00:55:40.840 --> 00:55:46.280]   we're going to take a break when we come back more with Andy and aco chicago

[00:59:26.920 --> 00:59:34.920]   things i like about squarespace is it's easy to set up a beautiful site we'll go to the music service

[01:00:37.880 --> 01:00:44.360]   to look great no matter what size that's one of the real advantages of the template however
[01:00:44.360 --> 01:00:50.840]   you customize it completely even if you're not a developer or designer just drag and drop
[01:00:51.400 --> 01:00:55.160]   makes it very easy to make it unique here it is the butler did it

[01:04:42.520 --> 01:04:47.400]   announcement leo he's old school he's been there that long yeah he worked at apple didn't he for a
[01:04:47.400 --> 01:04:51.560]   while i think that's what i know if he was at mac world for a long time oh mac world that's right
[01:04:51.560 --> 01:04:57.240]   yeah yeah i confuse it too uh i don't know if you've fired up your apple tv lately but if you did boy
[01:04:57.240 --> 01:05:03.560]   the icons go off the screen now they've they've added vvo disney disney xd weather channel smith
[01:05:03.560 --> 01:05:08.120]   sonyin uh it goes on and on and i've actually been watching the vvo channel it's kind of a nice
[01:05:08.120 --> 01:05:13.640]   way to listen to music and have the video on the screen it killed my apple tv leo did it you can't
[01:05:13.640 --> 01:05:17.720]   watch it anymore i went to vvo i hit the first button which was lady gaga and then it would it
[01:05:17.720 --> 01:05:23.240]   would not stop there was no control worked anymore it was just gaga after gaga after gaga i had that
[01:05:23.240 --> 01:05:28.520]   happen to me too it's so funny i was watching applause and uh then it just segwayed right into
[01:05:28.520 --> 01:05:34.200]   the next one the next one the next one but i i was able to back out of it i couldn't i couldn't i
[01:05:34.200 --> 01:05:38.440]   think it was the village people feature film that put it best when it said you can't stop the music
[01:05:38.440 --> 01:05:46.760]   um i you know it's nice to see but i think apple at some point is in fact the point is now
[01:05:46.760 --> 01:05:52.760]   needs to have some sort of control of this somebody uh on twit uh told us there is a nice feature
[01:05:52.760 --> 01:05:57.960]   if you go into the parental controls which you would not think to do but if you if you're not
[01:05:57.960 --> 01:06:02.360]   apparent but if you go to parental controls you can turn off any of those channels so if you don't
[01:06:02.360 --> 01:06:10.440]   watch you know uh what is that crunchy role which i don't that's the anime channel you can remove it
[01:06:10.440 --> 01:06:17.560]   as if it's at parental control uh i took disney out immediately that's that's the parental control i
[01:06:17.560 --> 01:06:22.360]   don't want any kids channels get off of my line i'm looking for it yeah
[01:06:22.360 --> 01:06:26.680]   the uh so you can actually run plex on your apple tv without jail breaking you can
[01:06:26.680 --> 01:06:32.680]   you can it's a lit it's not it's well how can i put this it's not a jailbroken i for apple tv
[01:06:32.680 --> 01:06:39.240]   um but it is a bit of um um it says a bit of a hack you have to run uh a device or a piece of
[01:06:39.240 --> 01:06:43.960]   code on your mac where you're running your plex media server oh and that uh runs a little web
[01:06:43.960 --> 01:06:49.320]   server and then you go across your apple tv and change your dns settings and you now have to
[01:06:49.320 --> 01:06:54.600]   install a certificate but it's very easy to do and then you can actually run plex on your apple tv
[01:06:54.600 --> 01:06:58.920]   and it works but i actually did this in last week's screencast online and the day before i published
[01:06:58.920 --> 01:07:03.560]   the show apple went and broke it because they changed they used the trail as app they went and
[01:07:03.560 --> 01:07:08.120]   broke it and then six hours later someone found a fix or was there to rescue my show so it's working
[01:07:08.120 --> 01:07:12.280]   now but there's no guarantee that it'll carry on working in there well anybody uses plex is
[01:07:12.280 --> 01:07:16.120]   used to doing stuff like that i mean that's just part that's part of the course it's plex connect
[01:07:16.120 --> 01:07:21.240]   it's fantastic awesome plex connect good tip i mean the interesting thing about this is that you know
[01:07:21.240 --> 01:07:26.280]   for a long time apples when there's been talk about an apple sdk for the apple tv and a lot of people
[01:07:26.280 --> 01:07:30.600]   have heard that apple's working on it a lot of developers have you know been planning things for
[01:07:30.600 --> 01:07:34.600]   it and yet apple just continually rolls out these partner channels and it you know it looks like
[01:07:34.600 --> 01:07:39.800]   that's not getting any attention in the short term either yeah rumor is the time Warner cable
[01:07:39.800 --> 01:07:45.560]   integration in the works by the way good news just in time for football you'll be able to watch
[01:07:45.560 --> 01:07:53.800]   cbs and time Warner again what a shock mg segler tweeted that oh my really just in time for football
[01:07:53.800 --> 01:08:04.760]   i wonder why that happened um on-demand weather esp n i do see a nasty trend towards putting the
[01:08:04.760 --> 01:08:12.760]   word watch in the icon i i think that really uh we should with apple should tell people not to do
[01:08:12.760 --> 01:08:18.680]   that yeah because you see you see that a lot with the with the channels on on roku where
[01:08:18.680 --> 01:08:24.200]   you get so much spring clutter that now they're now all these channel makers are kind of empowered
[01:08:24.200 --> 01:08:28.440]   to say well we got to make this as garish and eye popping as possible just to be seen and so
[01:08:28.440 --> 01:08:33.400]   i mean compare the nba lycon compare the itunes radio ycon to all of these third party ones and
[01:08:33.400 --> 01:08:38.760]   they just get louder and louder doesn't apple control that can't they i mean steve jobs famously
[01:08:38.760 --> 01:08:44.040]   called vikgun dojra at church to say the gradient wasn't good in the google icon
[01:08:44.040 --> 01:08:49.640]   can't apple say hey no disney i guess they can't say that to disney and by the way yes you can is
[01:08:49.640 --> 01:08:54.280]   also disney isn't it they're all disney properties hmm supposedly steve jobs didn't like at least
[01:08:54.280 --> 01:08:58.600]   the guy on the apple tv team who tweeted it said steve jobs did not like this interface and canned
[01:08:58.600 --> 01:09:03.000]   and then yeah that's right i remember that and but it's maybe just maybe exactly for this reason i
[01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:07.000]   mean i think i would like to think that this is an indicator that apple's going to revamp the
[01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:12.360]   interface so that this clutter is not so big a problem but we sometimes apple is not as you know
[01:09:12.360 --> 01:09:16.280]   together as we all imagine it to be so it's possible that just it's going to have to break
[01:09:16.280 --> 01:09:21.240]   before someone really uh pays attention to it it's like the eye of sauron you know when it's on a
[01:09:21.240 --> 01:09:25.960]   product it's burning and glaring and when it's not it's absolute complete darkness yeah peter
[01:09:25.960 --> 01:09:29.960]   coffee reporting on all things d which is quite interesting that the weather channel has life
[01:09:29.960 --> 01:09:35.960]   capability so that while most of this stuff as always with apple tv is canned you know rerun
[01:09:35.960 --> 01:09:42.200]   uh if there is a apple tv can do live we know because of the uh iTunes music festival which
[01:09:42.200 --> 01:09:47.480]   started with the apple on the keynote streaming yeah so that's cool i think it'd be very interesting
[01:09:47.480 --> 01:09:53.640]   to see uh live uh storm coverage things like that what was interesting with the with the plex
[01:09:53.640 --> 01:09:59.000]   connect thing actually is that um because people had installed the plex connect uh on their apple tv
[01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:03.320]   you know they sort of vowed right that's it plex is working on the apple tv i'm not actually going
[01:10:03.320 --> 01:10:08.280]   to ever upgrade my apple tv now i'm going to keep it you know that's it but what it was is that it
[01:10:08.280 --> 01:10:12.600]   actually uses the trailer app which is an apple trailer app and they can actually push as and as
[01:10:12.600 --> 01:10:17.320]   we've seen you know apps can just appear and disappear so they don't have to push down an update to the
[01:10:17.320 --> 01:10:22.600]   apple tv to um bring these new channels in and out they can actually do that sort of on the fly
[01:10:22.600 --> 01:10:27.880]   so that made everyone because they changed the trailer app everyone's plexkin x broke right i
[01:10:27.880 --> 01:10:32.760]   stand corrected the disney channels also if you are a subscriber on cable will show live
[01:10:32.760 --> 01:10:36.360]   um
[01:10:36.360 --> 01:10:43.320]   and uh i guess at some point time Warner will do that i wonder i wonder if the cable companies
[01:10:43.320 --> 01:10:47.480]   even care about that so long as they've got uh because we see so many channels where you get
[01:10:47.480 --> 01:10:51.960]   premium content on tablets for free so long as you can sign in and prove that yes i'm over
[01:10:51.960 --> 01:10:56.120]   verizon or concast subscriber here is my login information on that site great so now i can get
[01:10:56.120 --> 01:10:59.560]   everything that hbo has on this app for free forever or as long as i keep paying
[01:10:59.560 --> 01:11:06.200]   but i noticed for instance though that uh verizon pushed an update to my uh dvr so that now when i
[01:11:06.200 --> 01:11:11.400]   turn it on instead of getting take me right back to the channel that i was on that channel is now
[01:11:11.400 --> 01:11:15.400]   in picture in picture and the entire screen is here's wonderful things on pay per view here are
[01:11:15.400 --> 01:11:20.040]   other events you can buy then just simply pushing one of these colorful buttons that i wonder how
[01:11:20.040 --> 01:11:25.880]   much of their business is tailored towards embracing technology like apple tv because it makes people
[01:11:25.880 --> 01:11:30.440]   want to buy premium services it makes them want to buy better internet internet connections
[01:11:30.440 --> 01:11:36.680]   versus it steals away from them the ability to sell other things if they're uh if they're uh
[01:11:36.680 --> 01:11:41.560]   they're sort of inviting apple tv users to keep going out for dinner instead of staying home and
[01:11:41.560 --> 01:11:46.040]   rating the rating the icebox or excuse me using the the hotel room mini fridge for the 18 dollar
[01:11:46.040 --> 01:11:54.600]   toberone bar why is toberone so damn expensive because it's so damn tasty
[01:11:54.600 --> 01:12:01.960]   oh it's i always reach for that and then i realize oh my god that's gonna cost more than a fine meal
[01:12:01.960 --> 01:12:09.720]   in a restaurant downstairs my point three toberone my my latest idea for a million dollar selling
[01:12:09.720 --> 01:12:14.920]   ios app or it'll be ios and android is that you essentially take a picture of your mini bar it
[01:12:14.920 --> 01:12:19.720]   uses your location say okay there is a wall greens and it's a point one miles away it's open
[01:12:19.720 --> 01:12:23.880]   until for the next three hours it can sell you that toberone for 89 cents as a matter of fact would
[01:12:23.880 --> 01:12:28.040]   you would you like me to place an order of that wall everything inside this mini bar
[01:12:28.040 --> 01:12:32.920]   create that comes to 16 dollars for the entire contents including booze we'll bring you the box
[01:12:32.920 --> 01:12:39.400]   and here's a map of how to get there i was just at a hotel where you know i hate that they do this
[01:12:39.400 --> 01:12:44.840]   in vegas too where it automatically bills you as soon as you move anything yeah you can't it's like
[01:12:44.840 --> 01:12:49.080]   too bad you bought it but i'm trying to nope you bought it you knocked the whole bar over you
[01:12:49.080 --> 01:12:55.160]   infra-grant you bought it loudest argument i ever let the most hostile interaction i ever had with
[01:12:55.160 --> 01:13:02.040]   with a account with a hotel staff was uh it's a san francisco hotel i it this was before they had
[01:13:02.040 --> 01:13:06.520]   those special sensors in there so this is like a while back so i simply you know they come there's
[01:13:06.520 --> 01:13:11.160]   like three coaks in the fridge i simply put in like i bought a 12 pack of coke and i was putting mine
[01:13:11.160 --> 01:13:15.800]   in but the every every day during the week the cleaning staff was counting the empty coke
[01:13:15.800 --> 01:13:22.120]   hands and so they presented me with a bill for something like 180 dollars and because i was like
[01:13:22.120 --> 01:13:27.400]   a 28 year old journalist who doesn't know dressed like a successful 28 year old anything uh they were
[01:13:27.400 --> 01:13:30.760]   saying oh you must do you know we know we just can't you're just gonna pay this bill or there's
[01:13:30.760 --> 01:13:36.280]   gonna be trouble at which point i blinked and i said you realize that i never want to be in
[01:13:36.280 --> 01:13:43.000]   this hotel ever again so there's nothing stopping me from creating the most hellacious fit inside
[01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:47.720]   this lobby where everybody's waiting to check in about what a bunch of idiots you are oh good
[01:13:47.720 --> 01:13:52.840]   though do you want me to do that or do you want me to simply say yes thank you very much for taking
[01:13:52.840 --> 01:13:57.400]   those fraudulent charges off my phone is it so i still remember that oh man i came so close to
[01:13:57.400 --> 01:14:03.640]   saying i should just start streaking anyway scream bloody murder like anyone is angry what else do
[01:14:03.640 --> 01:14:08.280]   you have like a chance for absolutely justified righteous anger you just don't have that opportunity
[01:14:08.280 --> 01:14:13.080]   muffin in life i'm too scared to ever do that i don't know why i just i've been trained by my
[01:14:13.080 --> 01:14:19.480]   parents because you know you'll look around and see like a million of these the day Leo lost it in the
[01:14:19.480 --> 01:14:25.640]   yeah he'll lose it on vine i do you ever have you guys ever pulled the do you know who i am
[01:14:25.640 --> 01:14:30.840]   never they will tell me that they don't know what he does that would be very sad for me yeah
[01:14:31.560 --> 01:14:35.640]   i just did it recently and it didn't work that's even more humiliating
[01:14:35.640 --> 01:14:42.200]   that's great that's why you do it the electronic arts you know the the stupid tapped out simpson's
[01:14:42.200 --> 01:14:47.080]   tapped out game which somehow just crashes on me i can't use it anymore but they still owe me
[01:14:47.080 --> 01:14:51.560]   for 1400 donuts that i've purchased that's like a hundred dollars worth of donuts
[01:14:51.560 --> 01:14:57.160]   and i've you know and and and millions of dollars in simpson coin
[01:14:58.200 --> 01:15:03.400]   uh so i finally last week i finally sent him the notes saying you you understand that i'm on a
[01:15:03.400 --> 01:15:07.160]   i don't i don't do the podcast that doesn't work but i do say you understand i'm on a radio show
[01:15:07.160 --> 01:15:11.240]   that's heard in 200 cities in the united states with over a million listeners every weekend and
[01:15:11.240 --> 01:15:18.120]   i could really and nothing i heard nothing back so that's embarrassing so don't it was like i never
[01:15:18.120 --> 01:15:22.760]   i hate doing that i'm trying again i don't ever want to do that do you know who i am i would like that
[01:15:22.760 --> 01:15:27.880]   phone for free i don't want to do that it was a great twitter a couple weeks ago where don
[01:15:27.880 --> 01:15:33.240]   melton took his iMac into for service at an apple store and maybe wasn't so happy with it and did
[01:15:33.240 --> 01:15:39.000]   pull the card that you know i created safari oh i like that one did it work apparently he got
[01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:45.640]   excellent service yeah you know i created safari that would work i knew steve jobs i played
[01:15:45.640 --> 01:15:51.400]   volleyball with steve jobs does that help does that help at all you know do that yeah
[01:15:51.400 --> 01:15:55.320]   now that's not gonna help i'm just never gonna buy another electronic arts project
[01:15:55.320 --> 01:16:01.000]   except for plants versus zombies which is quite good uh see they got me they keep pulling me in
[01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:07.480]   u.s government says android is malware that's not malle should start you know telling people
[01:16:07.480 --> 01:16:15.880]   they are android is i'm sorry i left out the last word is a malware magnet thanks to
[01:16:15.880 --> 01:16:23.000]   ous fragmentation the department of homeland security and the fbi says android devices expose
[01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:28.840]   us agencies to a significantly greater malware threat in part because so many devices run out
[01:16:28.840 --> 01:16:32.920]   dated versions of the mobile o s this is the kind of press you just can't buy
[01:16:32.920 --> 01:16:42.120]   so you can't perhaps it's time for an ios android you know app was we had the mac and pc apps they
[01:16:42.120 --> 01:16:47.400]   were very popular yeah i do ios and android apps and it looks like i'm just leading story though
[01:16:47.400 --> 01:16:52.040]   because it gives you indications of percent like if there's eight infected devices and nine of
[01:16:52.040 --> 01:16:55.640]   them are android i mean that's that's an insignificant number but it's a huge percentage
[01:16:55.640 --> 01:17:00.600]   those are always very nebulous everything as my father's next kcd cartoon about this just last
[01:17:00.600 --> 01:17:05.720]   week about saying oh my god chances are are more than double of us getting getting eaten by a shark
[01:17:05.720 --> 01:17:10.600]   who's firing laser beams we go to this beach we should go to the other beach yeah like yeah
[01:17:10.600 --> 01:17:15.080]   twice of really really insignificant percentages still are really insignificant still insignificant
[01:17:15.080 --> 01:17:21.720]   um android has they have activated now one billion android devices they just crossed that line
[01:17:22.360 --> 01:17:25.320]   and the next version of android i don't know how this happened
[01:17:25.320 --> 01:17:31.320]   is going to be called not key lime pie you know they do it alphabetically so there was a clair
[01:17:31.320 --> 01:17:41.480]   donut a clair uh froyo gingerbread hot potato hot pocket what was h i never remember h
[01:17:41.480 --> 01:17:50.040]   honeycomb thank you izecrim sandwich and jelly bean they can be hungry none of those are brand
[01:17:50.040 --> 01:17:56.280]   names but my kit cat is it's a brand and nestly trademark apparently nestly knows and doesn't care
[01:17:56.280 --> 01:17:59.960]   but that's the next version of android according to the bbc i think that sounds like a joke i don't
[01:17:59.960 --> 01:18:07.240]   know yeah kitty what's wrong with key lime pie come on well it's very very tart you can't really
[01:18:07.240 --> 01:18:11.240]   have dairy products with it they're doing a crossover leo if you're going to go into the
[01:18:11.240 --> 01:18:15.560]   sorry what are they called deafeners and in america 7 11s you'll see um all these kit cats with
[01:18:15.560 --> 01:18:19.640]   little android logos on really some of them will have tickets that give you a free nexus is that
[01:18:19.640 --> 01:18:26.280]   true yeah yeah will you kid me it's really one tickets yeah i'm going to go buy some kit cat
[01:18:26.280 --> 01:18:31.640]   bars i mean tickets it's like i i i really wish i could see the browser history on this decision
[01:18:31.640 --> 01:18:35.720]   that it's it was probably like a something that they were actually using internally and then they
[01:18:35.720 --> 01:18:38.760]   said well what the hell let's use this but we're gonna we're gonna have to like get permission to
[01:18:38.760 --> 01:18:43.560]   use it and then this then then people who like don't work with code got into the involvement that
[01:18:43.560 --> 01:18:46.680]   that's why i was saying that i hope that i hope that google said well look we're gonna be promoting
[01:18:46.680 --> 01:18:50.120]   your brand we're gonna have to insist you give us sixty five thousand dollars
[01:18:50.120 --> 01:18:56.760]   just to sweeten the deal a little bit prepare for a sweet new treat this is android.com/kitcat
[01:18:56.760 --> 01:18:59.960]   and i thought this was a joke from the bbc i really didn't believe it
[01:18:59.960 --> 01:19:05.000]   android is here but i'm glad to make this really kitcat chance to win a nexus 7 or google play
[01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:11.400]   credit but then you but you got to eat kitcat bars which suck so check if you've won yeah yeah
[01:19:11.400 --> 01:19:15.160]   so you get a code on it or something like that or what what is what is the best thing
[01:19:15.160 --> 01:19:19.720]   gonna do what does it come to do when like when this version of android is released and now like
[01:19:19.720 --> 01:19:24.200]   there's the three months later it's like deadly deadly virus in kitcat
[01:19:24.200 --> 01:19:30.840]   expert department of homeland security says kitcat bars are 10 times more likely to harbor
[01:19:30.840 --> 01:19:37.320]   malware kitcat adoption slow are they gonna make an android kitcat kitcat tied to identity theft
[01:19:37.320 --> 01:19:46.200]   and mortgage fraud i think the next the next version of of if they're smart is going to be
[01:19:46.200 --> 01:19:51.080]   called like Ferrari 428 because if they if this was just a scam to get free kitcat bars the entire
[01:19:51.080 --> 01:19:58.120]   company or somebody did say the next version is going to be called android mac pro yes
[01:19:58.120 --> 01:20:05.320]   someone said on twitter that the it's the the new advert for the event next week it's actually
[01:20:05.320 --> 01:20:10.280]   smallties so it's marty's those are little smarties that a kitcat yeah what i don't think apple would
[01:20:10.280 --> 01:20:17.000]   ever do anything like this therefore i don't think that no no it seems so down market in a way i
[01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:21.880]   know it would be it would be funny if it were like a but headed a strong and astronomer thing
[01:20:21.880 --> 01:20:26.840]   it's a segant thing and they got sued by the company for it but when it's like no let's do we can do
[01:20:26.840 --> 01:20:32.440]   we can turn this into a synergist synergistic uh co-marketing thing it's like that's not really
[01:20:32.440 --> 01:20:37.880]   classy but okay are they gonna when they get to t are they gonna call it tim tams no toblaron
[01:20:37.880 --> 01:20:38.520]   toblaron
[01:20:38.520 --> 01:20:43.400]   i mean leo they do have a branding problem because like you know everyone goes in and buys an
[01:20:43.400 --> 01:20:46.840]   iphone but there's so many different brands and sub brands there's droids and sound and people
[01:20:46.840 --> 01:20:50.520]   going and buy a sam song phone at least this way they get some attention back on android
[01:20:50.520 --> 01:20:55.800]   uh it's good for android yeah actually that is a good fit because there's also kitcat fragmentation
[01:20:55.800 --> 01:21:00.840]   because now you got the white shop with kitcat now you got the big the giant kitcat giant kitcat
[01:21:00.840 --> 01:21:06.120]   oh i think that with caramel oh is kitcat kitcat worldwide are they called kitcats in germany
[01:21:06.120 --> 01:21:11.960]   yes they are they're called kitcats in the uk are they called kitcats in canada yes or they
[01:21:11.960 --> 01:21:20.200]   called tims bits look at cat look kitcats in france they're called the catroyal

[01:23:27.480 --> 01:23:30.840]   it was a mess on the windows side i was very disappointed the servers were down
[01:23:30.840 --> 01:23:36.120]   uh they decided to postpone the release until uh august of the sim city for the mac
[01:23:36.120 --> 01:23:40.440]   already people are having all sorts of similar server problems

[01:23:48.520 --> 01:23:52.840]   i'm you know i was more excited about till i realized you can't build a very big city there's
[01:23:52.840 --> 01:23:57.240]   there's limits around your it's anyway i don't care i don't have time to play sim city

[01:24:04.520 --> 01:24:08.600]   back with our picks of the week what do you say kids any other stories you wanted to talk about
[01:24:08.600 --> 01:24:17.080]   anyone you learn all right archer Andy goes
[01:24:18.360 --> 01:24:21.960]   i'm just trying to screw up your frame rate
[01:24:21.960 --> 01:24:28.520]   our show today rati via our good friends at audible.com i'm not going to recommend the book i'm reading
[01:24:28.520 --> 01:24:33.400]   right now because it's a little too depressing it's called the denial of death by earnest baker
[01:24:33.400 --> 01:24:36.680]   but i actually think it's actually great i should have read it in college that's when most people
[01:24:36.680 --> 01:24:40.920]   read it but you don't you know so that's the point is that audible has 150 000 titles some
[01:24:40.920 --> 01:24:48.600]   of the extremely serious the 19 i'm sorry 19 the 1913 hugo award winner no the 2013 hugo award
[01:24:48.600 --> 01:24:54.040]   winner john scaldsies red shirts narrated by will we eaten a lot of people have been raving about
[01:24:54.040 --> 01:25:01.000]   this it just won the hugo award for best novel for 2013 would be a great choice for you what are you
[01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:07.000]   listening to andi and not go my recommendation this time is actually a book that i read like
[01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:10.680]   eight years ago and really really loved and just noticed a couple days ago that it was available
[01:25:10.680 --> 01:25:15.800]   and audible it's called confederates in the attic dispatches from the unfinished civil war by tony
[01:25:15.800 --> 01:25:21.720]   horwitz uh it's a it's the this guy just spent some time hanging out with civil war reenactors
[01:25:21.720 --> 01:25:29.560]   and it's a i love these books that help you to get some insight into a hobby that some people love
[01:25:29.560 --> 01:25:33.320]   and some people are passionate about that you have absolutely no knowledge or connection to
[01:25:33.320 --> 01:25:39.080]   because uh this book taught he talks to and hangs out with a whole bunch of people covering an entire
[01:25:39.080 --> 01:25:45.000]   a really broad spectrum of people who are into this hobby from people who just enjoy an opportunity
[01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:50.200]   to you know spend weekends just you know sleeping in the sleeping in grass and and reenacting
[01:25:50.200 --> 01:25:54.440]   reenacting battles to people who feel as though they're doing very very serious work to people
[01:25:54.440 --> 01:26:01.560]   who feel as though they are putting themselves in touch with a time of american history that they
[01:26:01.560 --> 01:26:05.640]   personally feel that they were a little bit more compatible with than the current times that
[01:26:05.640 --> 01:26:11.320]   they're living in so it covers a really broad spectrum and and you learn things about uh people
[01:26:11.320 --> 01:26:15.880]   that you just would never have experienced otherwise again like they're they're those who
[01:26:15.880 --> 01:26:22.680]   dress up in more halloween costumese sort of civil war gear and then they're the people that are so
[01:26:22.680 --> 01:26:27.960]   intensely into it that they never ever they're their uniforms are perfectly accurate
[01:26:28.600 --> 01:26:34.920]   they never laundry no zippers but not not not just that but completely accurate down to the thread
[01:26:34.920 --> 01:26:40.040]   count down to the hand stitching down to the the fact that they they sweated through them for four
[01:26:40.040 --> 01:26:45.000]   days and then they kept it in a sealed container since the last one so it's still be absolutely
[01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:51.160]   rank they're going to be eating for three days heart attack that is infested with weevils
[01:26:51.160 --> 01:26:56.840]   pork that is that this magity and rotten because that's exactly the the field conditions that they
[01:26:56.840 --> 01:27:01.960]   feel as though the soldiers in this battle would have had uh so it's and and also and and then you
[01:27:01.960 --> 01:27:07.160]   have like as a comic book nerd of course i know nothing of this sort of this sort of obsession
[01:27:07.160 --> 01:27:11.000]   but then they're the people who are like well you know i i can't believe that you you coming in your
[01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:16.040]   rv you're wearing up you're wearing a plastic sword you've got halloween blood coming out of your mouth
[01:27:16.040 --> 01:27:22.440]   how come you're not bloated with dysentery i was drinking water from them from from ruts in the
[01:27:22.440 --> 01:27:27.720]   rose for eight weeks to make sure that i would have diarrhea for four weeks that's the way that the
[01:27:27.720 --> 01:27:32.440]   confederate soldier would have been when he felt when he was at monasses i'm like all right i really
[01:27:32.440 --> 01:27:39.080]   just wanted to take my kids and get one of those old tiny photos maybe i'm sorry so the only the
[01:27:39.080 --> 01:27:43.560]   only bad thing about this book is that i i read the unabridged version so long ago i actually read
[01:27:43.560 --> 01:27:48.360]   in paperback believe it or not this is the abridged version but every bit of that book i really
[01:27:48.360 --> 01:27:52.600]   really enjoyed so i'm really happy that i spotted it so i could have recommended today very good
[01:27:52.600 --> 01:27:57.080]   there's so many good dust it's hard it's hard to narrow it down but we're gonna get you one book
[01:27:57.080 --> 01:28:02.440]   and at least get you started new jim henson biography just came out that should be i know i saw i

[01:28:40.680 --> 01:28:45.480]   the dog washing the dishes i was folding laundry this morning you can't hold a book while you're
[01:28:45.480 --> 01:28:50.520]   folding laundry but you know what you could listen to a book i get hours every day just because i
[01:28:50.520 --> 01:28:55.560]   can listen and that's why audible is so great it brought books back into my life back in 2000 when

[01:30:06.200 --> 01:30:12.280]   know it's time to reread it 42 hours that should get me through the trip audible.com/macbreak try it
[01:30:12.280 --> 01:30:21.480]   today free time for our picks of the week i got one for you rene richy just came out on the mac
[01:30:21.480 --> 01:30:26.200]   app store yes this is all you you already know i'm a time was this gonna be your pick nope
[01:30:26.760 --> 01:30:30.840]   i saved it for you leo thank you it's only the other people who care about this pick are me and
[01:30:30.840 --> 01:30:37.240]   rene because we have more hue light bulbs than any human alive yeah hue is this light bulb the
[01:30:37.240 --> 01:30:42.520]   led light bulb from phillips that is an RGB there's a new company doing this too by the way i should
[01:30:42.520 --> 01:30:46.520]   mention and hue is just announced besides the light bulbs now they have standalone lamps and they
[01:30:46.520 --> 01:30:52.280]   have led strips you can control them all with a new three-dollar program from the mac app store
[01:30:52.280 --> 01:31:00.920]   not from phillips it's called hue menu hue menu it adds a menu to your mac i can't i have it but i
[01:31:00.920 --> 01:31:04.600]   can't show it to you because i don't have hues here at the studio i shouldn't really set up some hue
[01:31:04.600 --> 01:31:10.440]   lamps at the studio but unless you change colors random mode all lights on all lights off you can
[01:31:10.440 --> 01:31:14.680]   have create this is actually probably better than the hue app itself which is kind of wonky
[01:31:15.640 --> 01:31:22.200]   to create presets you can see where your lamp is right now it's really a really a nice little app
[01:31:22.200 --> 01:31:31.160]   for managing hue so i now i'm looking at the reviews there they seem to be very negative
[01:31:31.160 --> 01:31:38.920]   so um you know i i just downloaded and installed it but i can't try it so maybe wait you know before
[01:31:38.920 --> 01:31:43.800]   you download it it sounds like things are not working very reliably on this program so let me
[01:31:43.800 --> 01:31:48.120]   check it and i will get back to you looking at the reviews now i should have checked these first
[01:31:48.120 --> 01:31:53.880]   a lot of people say it's not working not working so let me let me check hue is a little funky that way
[01:31:53.880 --> 01:31:59.320]   uh and even the hue app itself is a little funky so don't okay i take it back not a recommendation
[01:31:59.320 --> 01:32:03.240]   don't buy it i will report back to you next week after i try it at all unless you're an
[01:32:03.240 --> 01:32:06.760]   experimenter because it's only really the price of a couple three bucks big deal around with the
[01:32:06.760 --> 01:32:12.280]   hue yeah yeah and i have a feeling that it will uh you know don't get it working
[01:32:13.160 --> 01:32:18.680]   um i just i'm more and more the more i use hue as uh as with rene the more we want to play with it
[01:32:18.680 --> 01:32:25.560]   and do other things uh with it uh if this then that combined with hue is a great and ambify which
[01:32:25.560 --> 01:32:29.240]   makes a huge change color with your music is also have you have you i have it on my phone i haven't
[01:32:29.240 --> 01:32:32.360]   used it yet is it fun yeah i've used it it's a lot of fun especially when you have like a group of
[01:32:32.360 --> 01:32:38.360]   people a party a bunch of kids yeah yeah that's good yeah you want everyone to make out all right
[01:32:38.360 --> 01:32:44.680]   the hue says time to make out there is another a hue app that's free maybe you should try this
[01:32:44.680 --> 01:32:50.600]   first called colors for hue uh it also sits in your menu bar the reviews are much more positive
[01:32:50.600 --> 01:32:56.280]   for this and it is free after all so maybe that would be the one to try colors for
[01:32:56.280 --> 01:33:01.160]   hue and the reviews are much more positive on this one although in many cases people are having
[01:33:01.160 --> 01:33:05.240]   trouble getting these apps to connect to the base station i think that i don't know i've had
[01:33:05.240 --> 01:33:09.000]   problems with even the hue app doing that so i'm wondering if it's a little funky
[01:33:09.000 --> 01:33:12.760]   funky i think there'll be a new hue app because things that require controls to be pulled up from
[01:33:12.760 --> 01:33:18.360]   the bottom won't last long and ios 7 i'm thinking oh that's right that's going to be very confusing
[01:33:18.360 --> 01:33:24.360]   it's very common you'll see the little hamburger on a tab on the bottom that you pull up and hue is
[01:33:24.360 --> 01:33:29.400]   one of them but that's going to interfere with the new notifications isn't it with control center
[01:33:29.400 --> 01:33:33.720]   yeah control center rather yeah hmm rene what's your pick of the week
[01:33:34.520 --> 01:33:38.760]   uh my pick of the week is an app and i have to confess i haven't tried it yet but i have several
[01:33:38.760 --> 01:33:43.640]   friends of mine who i adore who've tried it out and told me i have to absolutely check it it's
[01:33:43.640 --> 01:33:49.080]   called desk connect and it's written by a very young i think he's 17 years old and this one of
[01:33:49.080 --> 01:33:53.880]   those cases where this you know a long time ago microsoft very famously put the ribbon bar in oa
[01:33:53.880 --> 01:33:59.480]   in uh office and and microsoft told bill gates there's no way to have it revert to the default position
[01:33:59.480 --> 01:34:03.800]   and some young kid in a week did it and this is the same thing apple is going to be doing airdrop
[01:34:03.800 --> 01:34:10.760]   on ios 7 and apple has not had the time or the ability to put um airdrop that works between oos
[01:34:10.760 --> 01:34:15.880]   10 and ios so what this guy did is he set up something very similar to airdrop it's a free app in the
[01:34:15.880 --> 01:34:21.880]   mac app store and you can use it to send little bits of shareable data between your mac and your
[01:34:21.880 --> 01:34:26.680]   iphone it's all the sorts of things you wish that you could just use airdrop that you wish apple would
[01:34:26.680 --> 01:34:31.240]   just build in and i'm sure they will build in eventually but until that you know amazing day
[01:34:31.960 --> 01:34:37.080]   this will handle a lot of those things maverick is going to push map data that looks like it's it
[01:34:37.080 --> 01:34:43.000]   so far but this will push most of the stuff that apple allows to be pushed tonight clever clever
[01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:50.680]   clever that'll love the kids they can do anything 17 how much is it i it's free free free isn't free
[01:34:50.680 --> 01:34:56.760]   yep free isn't google from screencasts online domic allisters here are you going to another geek

[01:36:35.800 --> 01:36:40.040]   the cap niel and i talked about because remember they you were on that one i think where they sailed
[01:36:40.040 --> 01:36:43.560]   up and down the california coast and they stopped at san francisco i said cap niel if you want us to
[01:36:43.560 --> 01:36:49.560]   be an excursion will be an excursion for you but they never did that so what's your pick of the week
[01:36:49.560 --> 01:36:54.440]   nanny right my pick it's not a new application it's been out for a while but it's one of my favorite
[01:36:54.440 --> 01:36:58.600]   ones uh it's on the iphone it's free i haven't actually covered it on screen cast on my because
[01:36:58.600 --> 01:37:03.160]   it's it's quite difficult to demonstrate because it's a location based application and it's called
[01:37:03.160 --> 01:37:08.840]   twist uh the tagline is twist dash on my way if you're looking for it in the app store and basically
[01:37:08.840 --> 01:37:14.520]   what it allows you to do it allows you to um create a twist that you send to somebody and what a twist
[01:37:14.520 --> 01:37:20.760]   is it's a way of tracking you on a journey so if you're going to head off to visit someone you can
[01:37:20.760 --> 01:37:26.040]   actually um select their destination select the destination select their contact details and send
[01:37:26.040 --> 01:37:31.240]   them a twist they can download the app and then they can actually see on a live map where you are
[01:37:31.240 --> 01:37:34.280]   and you can also message them on the way and if you're going to be late it'll send them a notification
[01:37:34.280 --> 01:37:39.320]   that they're going to be late and it works fantastically you can also request an arrival time from someone
[01:37:39.320 --> 01:37:43.320]   as well and they can send it to you so you can track when they're actually coming to you but i've
[01:37:43.320 --> 01:37:47.800]   used it several times and it works flawlessly um my son sent me one when he was traveling back
[01:37:47.800 --> 01:37:52.200]   from university and actually saw him coming all the way over the penines and into the vapour and
[01:37:52.200 --> 01:37:56.120]   then straight past our house and then to the local shops and stop there and then came back to our
[01:37:56.120 --> 01:38:01.240]   house again so he came and said why did you go to the shops and he sort of forgotten he'd sent me
[01:38:01.240 --> 01:38:06.680]   the twist and how did you know that so it's a great no but it really is a great way of um you
[01:38:06.680 --> 01:38:10.360]   know if you're waiting for people to arrive and you want to just make sure that it okay or just
[01:38:10.360 --> 01:38:16.040]   keeping tracks on people it's uh it's a brilliant application i have i've been using glimpse gl y
[01:38:16.040 --> 01:38:21.560]   m pse which does the same thing for a long time and how is it different or is it different at all
[01:38:21.560 --> 01:38:26.440]   i'm not sure i did use glimpse in the early days but um i don't know why i didn't stop using the
[01:38:26.440 --> 01:38:31.800]   bias i started to use this about six or seven months ago yes uh it fits the dot i've used both
[01:38:31.800 --> 01:38:38.360]   and my impression is that twist is really great for one of those uh uh you're actually meeting up
[01:38:38.360 --> 01:38:42.200]   somebody at a certain place and everybody's converging the same location you want to make sure you know
[01:38:42.200 --> 01:38:47.560]   what their situation with their destination is glimpse is not quite that good at that uh glimpse
[01:38:47.560 --> 01:38:53.080]   is better for for i've got a 45 minute window or two hour window in which i want these people to
[01:38:53.080 --> 01:38:56.920]   be able to know who where i am and i want the those people to know where they are excuse me i want
[01:38:56.920 --> 01:39:01.240]   to know where they are too so glimpse is more of a place where we're all at disney world we're
[01:39:01.240 --> 01:39:05.800]   gonna separate for an hour and i want to make sure that if i if i need to find you know my uncle or
[01:39:05.800 --> 01:39:09.960]   my my niece i can find i know exactly where they are how close we are how close we are because for
[01:39:09.960 --> 01:39:14.120]   the one thing that's glimpse doesn't do very well i think is notifications so twist is great because
[01:39:14.120 --> 01:39:19.960]   you just tap it and then forget about it because like as don says if you get stuck in traffic if you
[01:39:19.960 --> 01:39:24.600]   have to stop off someplace on the way if you get into car trouble or something you don't have to do
[01:39:24.600 --> 01:39:29.240]   anything because twist will simply send out notifications saying okay we have a revised eta
[01:39:29.240 --> 01:39:35.320]   for andy andy will now be there at 525 and not 510 and then people can go go check in so that's
[01:39:35.320 --> 01:39:39.640]   they're they're close in in operation but i think the twist is much much better that sort of thing
[01:39:39.640 --> 01:39:47.320]   well i'm gonna start using twist forget glimpse by by glimpse andy what do you got for us
[01:39:48.120 --> 01:39:54.360]   i got a couple of things i love alo clip uh that's that fun fun like yeah it's it's just such a
[01:39:54.360 --> 01:39:59.960]   missing link because in the iphone four and five you have a uh a phone that's really
[01:39:59.960 --> 01:40:03.960]   practically as good as a camera and the only thing that you can't really do with it is go a
[01:40:03.960 --> 01:40:08.280]   little bit wider which is what the alo clip will let you do and so the alo clip let's you do that
[01:40:08.280 --> 01:40:13.080]   now they've added two they're they're two things that they've added that have one that's been kind
[01:40:13.080 --> 01:40:18.280]   of essential for me and one that i've really really wanted this is the alo clip telephoto
[01:40:18.280 --> 01:40:24.840]   which gives you a 2x telephoto lens oh tonight there you go there hello this is me being very
[01:40:24.840 --> 01:40:31.800]   very small and now if i turn it to the end this is me being bigger slightly bigger bigger andy hello
[01:40:31.800 --> 01:40:38.440]   yes a graphical demonstration that yes this is in fact a telephoto lens so it's a 2x telephoto
[01:40:39.000 --> 01:40:44.680]   it also comes with a circular polarizer lens so that which you can use with or without uh
[01:40:44.680 --> 01:40:50.920]   i'm sorry as an option uh so that the circular polarizer will let you deepen colors without
[01:40:50.920 --> 01:40:55.160]   doing it in a fake digital way it also lets you do things like if you want to take a picture of
[01:40:55.160 --> 01:41:00.120]   something that's under glass in a museum by twisting the circular polarizer it will sort of bend
[01:41:00.120 --> 01:41:04.360]   rebens piece uh some of those lights so the reflections will be minimized or even removed
[01:41:04.360 --> 01:41:10.040]   altogether and it's not cheap it's like 129 bucks but that's the difference between having true
[01:41:10.040 --> 01:41:15.640]   optical 2x as opposed to well just pinch and zoom and i'll make the pixels bigger so if you
[01:41:15.640 --> 01:41:19.880]   are one of those people those awful people in that no-kiya commercial you know taking video of
[01:41:19.880 --> 01:41:23.800]   their kid like on stage and your eight rows back you will have a much much better video of them
[01:41:23.800 --> 01:41:28.280]   because you actually shot it with a telephoto lens um the other thing though is something that i've
[01:41:28.280 --> 01:41:32.680]   whether you have the the original or not it's something i've been wanting for a long long time i
[01:41:32.680 --> 01:41:37.400]   love a la clip but i don't love the fact that it means that because it clips right onto your phone
[01:41:37.400 --> 01:41:42.120]   you can't keep it inside a case so a la clip decided to develop a case that accommodates the
[01:41:42.120 --> 01:41:46.360]   a la clip so here's what it is and it looks like your basic case but when you want to put your
[01:41:46.360 --> 01:41:51.960]   a la clip on you can just simply flip this part over and click your a la clip into place
[01:41:51.960 --> 01:41:58.200]   you said zip zip as easy as that uh and so now it's out of the way so you can have your a nice case
[01:41:58.200 --> 01:42:04.680]   it's also kind of cool because if you look at what it actually did i i love the the the
[01:42:04.680 --> 01:42:08.520]   the all clip people they must be really great at those like twisting nail puzzles and sliding
[01:42:08.520 --> 01:42:13.320]   tile puzzles they really are good at figuring things out so it's it's all you have to do to make
[01:42:13.320 --> 01:42:17.560]   this work uh if you're a designer as well just have something that covers up this but then can slip
[01:42:17.560 --> 01:42:23.000]   out of the way but then someone came up the clever idea of gee if we like make this bit kind of springy
[01:42:23.000 --> 01:42:28.200]   and we make sure that the other part of it sort of naturally lands over the volume button we can
[01:42:28.200 --> 01:42:33.000]   actually turn this into a shutter button so that you push this down and now you're pushing the shutter
[01:42:33.000 --> 01:42:39.400]   so that that's really quite cool also as part of the same package i believe it's 59 bucks you also
[01:42:39.400 --> 01:42:47.640]   get this little dealie right here which when you snap it in adds a tripod mount and also a little
[01:42:47.640 --> 01:42:52.840]   like dumb bracket i'm sliding the little dingus off of that uh so that you can actually put in
[01:42:52.840 --> 01:42:59.160]   like a flash or excuse me a led illuminator or a microphone uh and as you can see it doesn't make
[01:42:59.160 --> 01:43:03.960]   it that much bulkier or heavier it holds securely and when you want to get rid of it it just pops
[01:43:03.960 --> 01:43:09.160]   right off so it's there are a lot of different solutions to turning the iPhone into something
[01:43:09.160 --> 01:43:15.720]   that's more camera like uh i think that the all clip people really have the right idea because
[01:43:15.720 --> 01:43:20.120]   they try to get those solutions and make them work in a way that doesn't make the iPhone as big
[01:43:20.120 --> 01:43:24.680]   and bulky and inconvenient as a camera it tries to accommodate the fact that this is a very slim
[01:43:24.680 --> 01:43:29.800]   lightweight and cool device and tries to get those that stuff working without making it less cool and
[01:43:29.800 --> 01:43:35.800]   and making it as adding as little bulk and weight as possible so again this is not an
[01:43:35.800 --> 01:43:43.080]   expensive lens but again compare a shot that was made but this optical 2x lens versus just blowing
[01:43:43.080 --> 01:43:48.040]   it up manually and you will see that yep i would it this costs a lot less money that would cost
[01:43:48.040 --> 01:43:54.600]   to go to recreate my kids recital and have that and and get a little bit closer so good stuff are
[01:43:54.600 --> 01:44:02.920]   you using that or the 1020 i'm using the 1020 yeah it's so that's fantastic though i've tried it to
[01:44:02.920 --> 01:44:06.600]   i love the yellow clip yeah and i have the case i haven't i haven't put it on yet but i have the case
[01:44:06.600 --> 01:44:12.520]   i'm waiting for the new iPhone 5s so uh i want to revise my pick and then we'll let get to you
[01:44:12.520 --> 01:44:17.800]   Renee since i had two sucky picks i noticed that luminaries are just about to take the stage in the
