[00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:33.600]   news joining us ladies and gentlemen the canonical panel the panel of my dreams. Mr. Jason Snell from
[00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:38.960]   all six hundred. Wake up, wake up, it's a dream. I'm dreaming. Jason will not be here next week. I
[00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:44.000]   can't imagine why not. I have been summoned to the mothership. What are you talking about?
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.560]   He's been summoned to the mothership. You know in other contexts that might mean these are the
[00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:53.760]   end of days for you. But yeah put on your purple ponchos everybody and new press figures.
[00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:59.280]   I get the nikeys out. We're going it's we're summoned to the mothership. Also ladies and gentlemen
[00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:06.560]   Mr. Andy Inaco from WJ, BH in Boston. Hello Andrew. Hello. It's going to be fun like on Wednesday
[00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:11.520]   Thursday, Friday like the week after the event to see which analysts and writers and podcasters
[00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:17.280]   have pink eye because they're they're all people who got to try like the same like VR headset. I think
[00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:22.640]   that's going to be my. It's the you know what there's going to be there's going to be a shortage of
[00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:28.480]   antibacterial wipes in Cupertino next week. That's why you bring your own bring your own
[00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:33.920]   for God. That's my prognostication and the OG breaker ladies gentlemen Alex Lindsay
[00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:42.880]   of office hours dot global hello Alex. I'm wondering I'm wondering. I actually what they actually do
[00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:46.880]   for that. You know like it's going to be because you know that it'll be someone who there's probably
[00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:54.080]   meetings for the last six months on just that one thing. Well Jason probably knows from headphones
[00:02:54.080 --> 00:03:01.120]   like the Max the iPod Max Pro. Did they they wipe them down? Well those we didn't get until
[00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:06.160]   they were out and what they what they did is they gave you your review unit and had you take it out.
[00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:10.960]   Yeah. It's just once yours which they can't do for this one but I imagine they're I mean Andy
[00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:15.120]   was talking about a shortage of antibacterial wipes and all that. I'd imagine there's shortage
[00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:20.400]   in the Cupertino area because they've all been purchased and are or Apple maybe they designed
[00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:25.760]   their own. They're going to be. They're going to be back to really. Apple. Apple. Back to the
[00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:29.760]   intern. Yeah. I'm betting on some sort of like a toilet seat cover like you just get your own
[00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:34.240]   individual like over your face before you put it on. It's slightly sticky so it sticks to your face
[00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:38.560]   and then you put it on and the crinkling or the crinkling. Okay. It's not normal. Make sure you
[00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:43.360]   remember to take it off before you go and see NBC afterwards. And save it if Jason if they do that.
[00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:47.440]   Oh man. I beg you. I'm going to put it in the Hall of Fame with those COVID masks. Yeah.
[00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:53.040]   Yeah. Oh yeah. Those are nice. Do you have an app? I'm having a though. Yeah. I never got one.
[00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:57.440]   They're okay. These are the Apple store. It's weird but yeah. They are. But the other ones
[00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:01.120]   at the Apple store. I save it in the power like we can't give you one. You can sell it. I have one
[00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:05.520]   in the pouch and I have one not in the pouch that I wore. I know it's not. That's your retirement plan.
[00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:12.480]   Yeah. I know. It's a shame. I'm prepared for the next wave as a podcast. One must have a retirement
[00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:19.600]   plan. Sock it away. You know what I'm socking away and I have to thank Jameson for this.
[00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:26.320]   You know the Steve Jobs archive. This is all online. This is make something wonderful Steve Jobs
[00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:34.400]   in his own words. Jameson who I don't know sent me this. And I looked and you can't buy it printed.
[00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:40.640]   It is the contents are on the Steve Jobs archive. And they printed a few for special people which
[00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:49.040]   Jameson must be. It went to Apple employees. And it also went to Pixar and all other Disney is my
[00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:54.160]   understanding. Oh, got it. So maybe he works at Disney. His Bob Iger was Bob Iger was really
[00:04:54.160 --> 00:05:01.680]   happy about. So yeah, I got from listener YM who works at ABC sent me one. Oh, which is awesome.
[00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:05.040]   But yeah, they're real. They're real rare and they're going on eBay and all that. But if you've
[00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:10.080]   got a friend who works at ABC, you might be able to get very expensive on eBay. If you but I will
[00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:14.720]   never sell this some really wonderful. This is I mean, you could read it online, like I said,
[00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:21.200]   but there's some really great stuff in this. All of this was created by Lorraine Powell Jobs,
[00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:27.440]   his widow and close friends to kind of preserve Steve's legacy. You know, and it's interesting
[00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:31.840]   stuff like this. Do you have an over the shoulder or should I hold it up? Which would you like me to
[00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:40.800]   do? This is a piece a memo on a Pixar notepad. A little note says Steve, President Clinton is
[00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:47.360]   holding is it's that one. And then Steve sitting under the Pixar lamp. I don't know if there's a
[00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:53.520]   forced perspective there if that actually is a giant Pixar. It is a giant Pixar lamp. Oh, you
[00:05:53.520 --> 00:06:00.400]   know, our ball. Wow. Wow. That's hysterical. I would hope it wouldn't squish you. Here's
[00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:06.000]   Steve. Very happy with many and Mickey. I wonder why. I wonder why.
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:15.200]   But my one of my favorite parts is a series of memos from Steve between Steve and Andy Grove.
[00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:22.720]   Did you read those? Anybody? Yeah. They're really oh, there we go. Now we have it. You know,
[00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:26.320]   I'll have to show it on the web though because you can't you can't really pick up
[00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:34.400]   the book. But it starts with an engineer from Intel. This is while Steve's at Pixar. Let me see if I
[00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:41.440]   can find it saying, Hey, we'd like to share information so we can make our Intel processors
[00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:47.280]   better. You guys really seem to know a lot. Oh, you have to. It's an e-reader book where you could
[00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:50.960]   get an apple. Now there's a web. There's a web version. It's a beautiful web version. Is there?
[00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:58.720]   Oh, yeah, there it is. Read now. Sorry. So the Intel engineer says, you know, Hey, I'd like to come over
[00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:02.880]   and we can have a little meeting. You could tell me all the secret stuff you've learned about
[00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:08.800]   graphics to which Steve says, you know, we put a lot of energy and time and money into that. How
[00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:15.120]   much are you going to pay me to which the engineer says, well, I was just thinking of an information
[00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:25.360]   exchange. I'm not going to pay anything. Never mind. And then Andy Grove, the chairman of Intel,
[00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:31.360]   sends a note to Steve saying, Hey, Steve, you know, when we got together, I shared stuff with you.
[00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:36.640]   It may be not as valuable as the graphics information that you've learned at Pixar. But,
[00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:42.320]   you know, I felt like the open exchange of information was kind of part of this and that,
[00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:47.280]   you know, it seemed reasonable that, you know, you would, you would participate. There's Steve
[00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:56.400]   outside the IBM offices, giving him the finger in 1983. Not a good move. And, and then Steve says,
[00:07:56.400 --> 00:08:03.600]   and this is what's amazing. I was wrong. He says, you're right. You're absolutely right.
[00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:11.520]   I've changed my position 180 degrees. And he ends up saying, come on over engineer.
[00:08:11.520 --> 00:08:19.600]   Let's talk. Really, really an amazing exchange and a different kind of Steve, to be honest. I
[00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:24.560]   didn't, you don't expect him to say I was wrong. I'm going to change my position 180 degrees.
[00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:30.000]   This is a story you hear from the people who work with him closely, though, is that he would
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:35.680]   be vociferously on one side of an issue. But the moment you convinced him that you were right,
[00:08:35.680 --> 00:08:40.080]   he would be vociferously on the other side of the issue, as if he thought of it himself, in fact.
[00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:45.600]   But I think, and they want to reinforce that in the Steve Jobs archive, that's what they're trying
[00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:48.240]   to do is bring out the other side, the other side, the other side, the other side, the other side,
[00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:52.880]   reinforce that aspect of Steve Jobs that once he got convinced that he was wrong,
[00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:57.520]   he didn't hold on to it. And it is, I mean, we can talk about all sorts of weird traits that Steve
[00:08:57.520 --> 00:09:01.840]   Jobs had, the ones that might not make you want to work with him. But this is a really good trait
[00:09:01.840 --> 00:09:05.680]   of his, which is the moment he was convinced he was wrong, he just let it go and said, "Okay,
[00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:08.320]   I was wrong." And so many people never do that.
[00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:13.840]   Yeah. It was a famous, it was a really great story. In one of the anniversaries of the original
[00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:19.600]   Mac launch, they had the entire Mac team. I think this was on a Mac hack a long, long time ago.
[00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:24.880]   But Bill Atkinson told a story about Steve, like, "Well, you know what, we're pinching pennies,
[00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:29.440]   trying to get all these graphics primitives. He's got, he did all the graphics routines for
[00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:34.000]   the original Mac OS and the original ROMs. Like, we just couldn't, we just desperate to get all
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:38.400]   this code to fit. And then Steve comes in my office and says, "We should have rounded rectangles
[00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:41.920]   as a, as a type." And I said, "Well, that's a waste of time, this waste." And then he took me on a,
[00:09:41.920 --> 00:09:46.800]   took me on a walk around the, around the neighborhood and pointed out license plates and traffic signs
[00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:51.680]   and billboards and all the places where they're rounded rectangles in nature. And then I've seen
[00:09:51.680 --> 00:09:55.920]   him and he convinced me that, you know, we absolutely have to do that. And then there's a,
[00:09:55.920 --> 00:09:59.600]   "Oh, warm like a plaza. Oh, that's, you know, that was Steve. That was Steve." And I forget who
[00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:05.760]   else, who wasn't a panel. He said, "Yeah." What you don't know is that I, I use that exact same
[00:10:05.760 --> 00:10:13.760]   walk to give in Steve of that, like, just two days earlier. That's great. Hey, he, he absorbed the
[00:10:13.760 --> 00:10:22.560]   lesson. Exactly. And he took it in and then regurgitated it. It is really a wonderful book. The print
[00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:29.760]   version is not out, but you can download it. It is free on Apple Books. It's a free on the Libby app.
[00:10:29.760 --> 00:10:35.120]   If you have a participating library or you can just download it from the site or even read it on the
[00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:41.200]   site. It's really cool, I have to say. And I, Jamison, I don't know you, but I love you, man.
[00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:46.800]   Thank you for sending me my own copy of this. It's really, it's cool to have it in book form.
[00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:52.480]   Really, really neat. I know. I hope, I hope they've released like, at least a paperback version of
[00:10:52.480 --> 00:11:00.160]   it because there's something tangible on the paper that it's, it's when people, when people go to a
[00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:05.360]   library, they see things on the shelf and people go into your house, you know, your guests over,
[00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:08.800]   when you have family members in there, they see something they can take down off of a shelf.
[00:11:09.760 --> 00:11:14.400]   I think it's an important enough book that I hope that that becomes a paperback. I would,
[00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:18.480]   I would easily pay money for this. Yeah. I mean, I guess you could download it and
[00:11:18.480 --> 00:11:22.880]   print it at Lulu or somewhere and get a pretty close fix. Similarly, I'm sure this was true just
[00:11:22.880 --> 00:11:28.000]   in time printed. Jamison does rub a little salt in the wound. His notes saying, "Love,
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:32.400]   Twit, and all your shows, Windows Weekly is by far my favorite. You're really knocked it out of
[00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:36.480]   the park bringing Richard and he's great. I love the cohesion. You three have together and
[00:11:36.480 --> 00:11:41.600]   laughed so hard at all. Paul's witty humor doesn't mention Mac Break Weekly at all. Maybe he was
[00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:46.640]   trying to get rid of this book. I think maybe that's the, that's the truth. I don't want this.
[00:11:46.640 --> 00:11:50.960]   I'm a Windows guy. Mac Break Weekly listeners are not giving that book away.
[00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:55.200]   That's exactly right. You know what? That is exactly right. And I don't blame you.
[00:11:55.200 --> 00:12:02.000]   I don't blame you. All right. You all act as if we are for sure going to see a nerd helmet to use
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:10.640]   Joanna Stern's lovely colloquialism on Monday. You know, Glenn Fleischman has been
[00:12:10.640 --> 00:12:19.040]   to offering bets saying, "We may see it, but they'll never offer it for sale in 2023."
[00:12:19.040 --> 00:12:25.600]   Said not this year. What do you guys think? Jason, you feel like you will be wearing a nerd helmet
[00:12:25.600 --> 00:12:30.080]   next week this time? Yeah. I mean, I think that it's happening because I think fundamentally,
[00:12:30.080 --> 00:12:33.840]   if everybody believed it was happening and it wasn't happening, Apple would have leaked it
[00:12:33.840 --> 00:12:39.440]   somewhere to diminish expectations and Apple is not doing that. We see a Wall Street Journal
[00:12:39.440 --> 00:12:44.080]   article saying, "Yeah, they got it wrong. Everybody got it wrong." According to people familiar with
[00:12:44.080 --> 00:12:50.960]   the matter, yeah, exactly. And instead, I do think Glenn has an outside shot at being right in the
[00:12:50.960 --> 00:12:57.520]   sense that this sounds like a product that is not going to be ready until the fall or late fall.
[00:12:57.520 --> 00:13:01.360]   And once you're in late fall, you're in December. And you know, well, we always,
[00:13:01.360 --> 00:13:06.320]   back when I did a space podcast, we always used to say end of year is next year. Like later this
[00:13:06.320 --> 00:13:11.520]   year is next year. It could be that's the case with the headset too. But I think they're going to
[00:13:11.520 --> 00:13:16.560]   announce something. The question is just sort of what the ship date is. And will they even say,
[00:13:16.560 --> 00:13:21.840]   by the end of the year, will they say later or coming soon or something vague like that? And also,
[00:13:21.840 --> 00:13:25.200]   the price is the same thing. I don't think personally, I don't think they're going to announce a price
[00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:27.440]   because they don't need to because it's nowhere near shipping.
[00:13:27.440 --> 00:13:32.000]   Yeah. And the people who want this are going to spend whatever they got to spend for it. They
[00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:36.640]   know it's not a consumer item. And if there's, I mean, all these little trickling pizza bits of
[00:13:36.640 --> 00:13:41.680]   information that we would expect to be hearing a write about now or last week about confirming
[00:13:41.680 --> 00:13:48.000]   that this thing is happening has happened. Like, for instance, a lot of writers and bloggers who
[00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:54.880]   talk specifically and exclusively about AR and VR have received invites to the event. That's
[00:13:54.880 --> 00:14:02.080]   pretty much a slam dunk. Yeah. And I think that the public version of this is probably late 2024.
[00:14:02.080 --> 00:14:05.680]   Like the late 2024, early 2025. More than a year from now.
[00:14:05.680 --> 00:14:09.360]   Yeah. So when we're talking about they're releasing something, he may be right,
[00:14:09.360 --> 00:14:12.720]   they're not going to release a commercial version, but they're going to release a developer version
[00:14:12.720 --> 00:14:16.160]   and then develop a version or probably ship before this end of this year, spring of next year.
[00:14:16.160 --> 00:14:21.920]   They want people to, you know, and so, but I think that it's, it is, but I think that the
[00:14:21.920 --> 00:14:28.400]   commercial version is still a solid 12 to 18, maybe 24 months out. And there, but they need
[00:14:28.400 --> 00:14:32.000]   people to build content. They need people to build content. They need people to understand it.
[00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:36.480]   They need to have people digging into it. And so I think that if they can sell a couple million
[00:14:36.480 --> 00:14:42.400]   units and get that, that really key gamma testing, beta testing, gamma testing out there and give
[00:14:42.400 --> 00:14:47.120]   the developer's time to make sure that this is a crisp platform. What really has damaged these
[00:14:47.120 --> 00:14:52.160]   platforms in the past is publicly relate public releases without great content.
[00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:56.480]   You know, you put them on, you get, you get to play Robo Recall for, you know, three hours.
[00:14:56.480 --> 00:15:01.520]   And, and then what do you do after that? You know, and every, and almost everything else after that
[00:15:01.520 --> 00:15:05.840]   is kind of dorky. You know, and so, so I think that I think that they're going to come out.
[00:15:05.840 --> 00:15:09.280]   I think we're going to see a lot of content and a lot of partners out of the gate. They're going
[00:15:09.280 --> 00:15:12.880]   to tell, they're going to show everybody, Hey, look at all these people that are already using it.
[00:15:12.880 --> 00:15:16.880]   You don't want to be left behind by the developer one and start making content for it,
[00:15:16.880 --> 00:15:19.840]   because this is the next thing. You know, and I think that that's where they're going to
[00:15:19.840 --> 00:15:23.120]   probably jump into it, but they're going to give the developers a solid year and a half to
[00:15:23.120 --> 00:15:30.160]   work on it. All right, Apple historians. Is there precedent for this? Is Apple ever released
[00:15:30.160 --> 00:15:35.440]   something that early and said you can't buy it. We want developers to try it, use it,
[00:15:35.440 --> 00:15:39.920]   develop for it and we'll see in a year and a half. I don't know if there's ever been an
[00:15:39.920 --> 00:15:46.160]   precedent for this level of what? Well, I mean, Alex is saying that for this level, and I think
[00:15:46.160 --> 00:15:50.960]   he's right there, but Apple has released several times a developer kit. They did it for Apple
[00:15:50.960 --> 00:15:57.840]   Silicon. They did it for Intel. They were the transition kit. It was actually like a Mac Pro case
[00:15:57.840 --> 00:16:02.320]   that had that. That was before they were selling and before they were selling it.
[00:16:02.320 --> 00:16:05.920]   Intel Intel's Max before they were selling Apple Silicon, they had it for developers.
[00:16:05.920 --> 00:16:12.080]   The difference this time is this product by all accounts is a product that anybody will be able
[00:16:12.080 --> 00:16:17.200]   to buy. When Alex describes it as being a developer kit, I don't think it will be
[00:16:17.200 --> 00:16:23.760]   phrased that way. I honestly don't think Apple has wired that way to say this is just for developers.
[00:16:23.760 --> 00:16:29.440]   I think they hope that some early explorers will also buy it, but I do think it'll probably be a
[00:16:29.440 --> 00:16:35.520]   de facto development kit because it's expensive. Here's from Scooter X, the Wikipedia article
[00:16:35.520 --> 00:16:42.320]   on the developer transition kit. The name of two prototype Mac computers made available to
[00:16:42.320 --> 00:16:51.920]   software developers in the transition to Intel. Then in the transition Apple Silicon.
[00:16:51.920 --> 00:16:59.440]   In 2005 at WWDC, Jobs said, "This is a development platform only. This is not a product that will
[00:16:59.440 --> 00:17:03.920]   never be shipped as a product." They made you send them back. It's just for you guys to get
[00:17:03.920 --> 00:17:08.720]   certain development. You'll have to return them by the end of 2006. We don't want them floating
[00:17:08.720 --> 00:17:13.040]   around out there. These are not products. I can see those exact words coming out of Tim Cook's mouth
[00:17:13.040 --> 00:17:21.680]   or whoever for this headset. That's the only disagreement here. That's kind of Glenn's
[00:17:21.680 --> 00:17:28.080]   feeling is like me that, well, I would say Apple will say, "This is not what the product is going
[00:17:28.080 --> 00:17:32.720]   to look like. There won't be a battery in your pocket. This is not the consumer product.
[00:17:32.720 --> 00:17:40.480]   This is a breadboard for people who want to learn about XROS and want to develop for it.
[00:17:40.480 --> 00:17:46.720]   We'll see you in a couple of years with an actual consumer product." That makes sense, actually.
[00:17:47.440 --> 00:17:52.000]   I think a lot of that makes sense, particularly if you go to the point of they want to be able to
[00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:57.920]   simply correct correctly. They want to be able to dismiss a lot of questions about usability and
[00:17:57.920 --> 00:18:02.480]   about its convenience as a consumer product. One of them being that, "Oh my god, Apple would never
[00:18:02.480 --> 00:18:06.960]   have an external battery pack." Well, Apple did. This isn't a consumer thing. This is to get this
[00:18:06.960 --> 00:18:12.720]   thing out the door. I think it'll be a lot more polished than a breadboard prototype or anything
[00:18:12.720 --> 00:18:17.040]   like that. Well, they've been making them. According to all the sources, including Mark German and
[00:18:17.520 --> 00:18:23.120]   Digitimes and Ming Chi Kuo, they've been building them. They've been buying screens from Samsung or
[00:18:23.120 --> 00:18:31.040]   Sony. They've been actually making them. Honestly, it is. I'm certain that they already have some
[00:18:31.040 --> 00:18:35.360]   in the field. I'm sure that they have some trusted developers who already have them so that
[00:18:35.360 --> 00:18:42.720]   during this presentation next week, they can do the almost traditional. Now, we gave some
[00:18:42.720 --> 00:18:47.520]   hardware to our friends at some of the something and like to invite them on to show you what they
[00:18:47.520 --> 00:18:54.240]   were able to accomplish in such a quick turnaround that they can say. That's by the way, the other
[00:18:54.240 --> 00:18:59.120]   problem with selling these, which Microsoft learned and meta learned, is really impossible to demo
[00:18:59.120 --> 00:19:05.360]   them because it's an experience. You can't see it on a 2D screen. Hard to imagine how this goes
[00:19:05.360 --> 00:19:11.680]   in an Apple Store too, right? Microsoft had hollow lens in the head stores, in the Microsoft stores
[00:19:11.680 --> 00:19:15.600]   and said, "Come on in. They were in the back and they invited everybody try them because it's the
[00:19:15.600 --> 00:19:20.640]   only thing you can do." Yeah, you have to do it, but it's going to be hard. But I think we are arguing
[00:19:20.640 --> 00:19:26.480]   in some ways over a marketing point because I think the price, if it's a $3,000 product,
[00:19:26.480 --> 00:19:30.480]   it's going to limit who buys it regardless of whether they call it a developer product or not.
[00:19:30.480 --> 00:19:34.400]   There is no evidence. I thought for a long time that they just call this a developer preview,
[00:19:34.400 --> 00:19:37.760]   right? There's no evidence that they're going to do that. I think they know there are enough
[00:19:37.760 --> 00:19:42.560]   people out there who will buy it regardless of it being a 1.0 piece of hardware with very
[00:19:42.560 --> 00:19:47.920]   little software for it for $3,000 because they just want to have it. I think that's the thing
[00:19:47.920 --> 00:19:54.320]   where they're going to... My suspicion is they're going to say it is for early adopters and developers,
[00:19:54.320 --> 00:19:58.800]   but they're not going to do the thing where they say it's just for developers and you have to return
[00:19:58.800 --> 00:20:01.680]   it to us or anything like that. I think they're just going to sell them. I don't think you're
[00:20:01.680 --> 00:20:05.440]   going to have to return it, but I do think they may require you to be a developer. If you remember,
[00:20:05.440 --> 00:20:09.520]   there's 30 million developers, registered developers for that poll, so there's still a pretty big market
[00:20:09.520 --> 00:20:16.480]   for them just to sell it into that market. You may have to put your $99 into buy it or whatever.
[00:20:16.480 --> 00:20:21.680]   They may make you jump over that hump more for optics than anything else. They don't want another
[00:20:21.680 --> 00:20:25.520]   $100. They just want the optics of this is the developer version. You buy the developer version,
[00:20:25.520 --> 00:20:31.360]   you're free to buy this device and people who are going to pay $3,000 will pay $3,100 without any
[00:20:31.360 --> 00:20:40.000]   real issue there. I do think that they'll sell as many as they can make. There'll be a lot of
[00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:42.880]   people that buy them and leave them in the box. They're just going to leave them shrink wrapped
[00:20:42.880 --> 00:20:48.800]   in the box. These are going to be the collector versions of these. I bet you 100,000 to 500,000
[00:20:48.800 --> 00:20:53.200]   will just go into people's... I just want one stuck in there because this is going to be...
[00:20:53.200 --> 00:20:57.920]   I think that people are going to be pretty excited about it. It'll either be an epic failure
[00:20:57.920 --> 00:21:02.480]   or an epic. Both Jason and I still have our cubes. I have my cube right there.
[00:21:02.480 --> 00:21:06.720]   I had a cube though. I foolishly give away. I wish I still had some.
[00:21:06.720 --> 00:21:11.840]   Anyway, even if it doesn't work out perfectly, we all like to keep them around.
[00:21:11.840 --> 00:21:23.840]   I think that it's going to be... I do think that they'll show hundreds of partners,
[00:21:23.840 --> 00:21:27.120]   not like 10 partners or 5 partners. They're going to show a lot of partners.
[00:21:27.120 --> 00:21:29.920]   They'll have a screen with a lot of locos.
[00:21:29.920 --> 00:21:34.880]   I think they're going to show a lot of actual use cases. I won't show hundreds of use cases.
[00:21:34.880 --> 00:21:40.560]   Mark Kermit tweeted two weeks ago that Hideo Kojima, who created Metal Gear Solid
[00:21:40.560 --> 00:21:48.480]   and Death Stranding, was spotted at Apple Park. I've also seen rumors and he mentions
[00:21:48.480 --> 00:21:53.120]   that No Man's Sky for the Mac, which was announced last year but has not come out.
[00:21:53.680 --> 00:21:58.800]   There's some thinking maybe No Man's Sky. There is a VR version on the PC side.
[00:21:58.800 --> 00:22:02.800]   Might come out with this. I tell you what, if I could play Metal Gear, if I could be a Mac
[00:22:02.800 --> 00:22:09.680]   in one of these, I might wear a nerd helmet. I might. They'd have to solve the movement issue,
[00:22:09.680 --> 00:22:14.480]   though. That's the problem. I don't know though. Games cost so much money to develop.
[00:22:14.480 --> 00:22:21.360]   Are you going to really put resources into targeted towards a really evolving sort of...
[00:22:21.360 --> 00:22:24.480]   Well, you don't know. This is the problem. No one knows what this market is.
[00:22:24.480 --> 00:22:31.200]   So I think Apple will show productivity. Microsoft has shifted the productivity. I don't know if that
[00:22:31.200 --> 00:22:36.560]   was the right thing to do. As has meta, by the way. They might show show, they might show gaming.
[00:22:36.560 --> 00:22:40.800]   Gaming is the only thing that's done well so far. Well, and remember that Apple has our Apple
[00:22:40.800 --> 00:22:44.880]   Arcade. They can fund their own games without breaking any of their own internal rules about
[00:22:44.880 --> 00:22:48.400]   what they give money to and what they don't. They can just say, "We're going to have someone
[00:22:48.400 --> 00:22:54.400]   develop this game and put it into the arcade as well." So Apple Arcade can be something that they
[00:22:54.400 --> 00:22:59.840]   can take the risk away from developers to develop for. I expect to live in.
[00:22:59.840 --> 00:23:05.520]   You know who believes Apple's going to release a headset? Meta. This week, they put out the
[00:23:05.520 --> 00:23:10.800]   Oculus 3 just to say, "Wait a minute. Hold on, hold on, hold on there." Yeah. Hold on.
[00:23:10.800 --> 00:23:14.240]   Hang on. It's a Mark Gurman who doesn't say where he got it, but it's very clear he got it from
[00:23:14.240 --> 00:23:22.000]   Meta. Yeah, exactly. This week I go. Mark, you've had a day to fix that. Come on. I go hands. Oh,
[00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:27.600]   maybe he means I go. I get it. I go hands-on with meta's yet to be announced Quest 3
[00:23:27.600 --> 00:23:32.080]   and explain how it may be the biggest challengers to Apple's headset. They're talking about how
[00:23:32.080 --> 00:23:39.360]   thin and light the Quest 3 is. Not what we're hearing about the Apple nerd helmet.
[00:23:39.360 --> 00:23:47.920]   Well, also remember that the Quest 2 exists. I have a Quest Pro. I was not overwhelmed by it.
[00:23:47.920 --> 00:23:52.560]   It wasn't worth the $1,600. I paid for it. It's still not worth the $1,000 they're charging these days
[00:23:52.560 --> 00:23:58.960]   for it. Yeah, I know. That's why I've seen some, I've already seen some maybe click-baity coverage
[00:23:58.960 --> 00:24:04.240]   at Hot Take, saying, "Oh, well, the real thing is from Apple is going to come until 2024, but when
[00:24:04.240 --> 00:24:09.200]   it does, Apple's going to run the table. They're going to own this category." And that's very
[00:24:09.200 --> 00:24:15.600]   possible given that they, given how much trust they've built up with people buying Apple products,
[00:24:15.600 --> 00:24:20.720]   maybe even spending the lecture for Apple products and how good their developer channel is. But nonetheless,
[00:24:20.720 --> 00:24:28.560]   all of that is based on the idea that Apple has a specific vision that is going to be flexible
[00:24:28.560 --> 00:24:34.800]   enough to cover anything anybody wants to do with it. It's possible that meta or some other
[00:24:35.600 --> 00:24:41.040]   producer that we haven't even heard of yet is going to not be the 90% of the marketplace,
[00:24:41.040 --> 00:24:44.880]   but be really, really successful against Apple by virtue of the fact that, "Look, we're not going
[00:24:44.880 --> 00:24:49.840]   to handcuff you. We're not going to make sure that, "Oh, well, you have to use iCloud for
[00:24:49.840 --> 00:24:54.000]   syncing." Well, my app doesn't use files. Well, you still have to use iCloud for files syncing,
[00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:57.680]   or else we want to prove you. So there's still a lot of variables coming in here.
[00:24:57.680 --> 00:25:03.040]   One thing that's interesting, at least when I read between the lines of German's
[00:25:03.840 --> 00:25:13.280]   post, is the focus on mixed realities. He talks about the video pass through performance.
[00:25:13.280 --> 00:25:18.720]   He says it will be close to that of the Apple device, which we'll have about a dozen cameras,
[00:25:18.720 --> 00:25:27.280]   more and more moving away from this virtual reality world to an augmented or mixed reality
[00:25:27.280 --> 00:25:32.720]   world where you can see what's going on around you. And it seems like both meta and Apple,
[00:25:32.720 --> 00:25:37.920]   from what we've heard, pure rumors in both cases, are now starting to focus more on that.
[00:25:37.920 --> 00:25:40.480]   Does that make sense? Is that a little bit of a pivot?
[00:25:40.480 --> 00:25:46.480]   I feel like the rumor that they had the equivalent of the digital crown that they were going to
[00:25:46.480 --> 00:25:51.280]   put on this thing to let you dilate between reality, augmented reality and virtual reality,
[00:25:51.280 --> 00:25:57.360]   that that was always part of their idea here that you can almost hear Johnny Ives saying,
[00:25:57.360 --> 00:26:01.520]   but we don't want them to feel cut off from the world. You can do a lot of things that are,
[00:26:01.520 --> 00:26:04.880]   the example I always give is that table tennis game, and I think I gave it here last week,
[00:26:04.880 --> 00:26:11.440]   that I play ping pong on the Quest 2. It's great, but I'm completely cut off because it's in a virtual
[00:26:11.440 --> 00:26:16.320]   space. And the idea that I could flip a switch and on the Quest 2, the quality of the cameras
[00:26:16.320 --> 00:26:21.360]   outside is terrible. But on a good one, where I could put that virtual ping pong table
[00:26:21.360 --> 00:26:27.360]   in reality so that I could still see if my dog comes in or a captain's in or a wife goes to the
[00:26:27.360 --> 00:26:32.720]   door and is like, what are you doing? I think that that's way better, honestly, not for all uses,
[00:26:32.720 --> 00:26:39.440]   but just the idea that you have sort of this two context switchable thing so that you aren't
[00:26:39.440 --> 00:26:43.440]   completely cut off from the world while interacting with it. I should also point out that that solves
[00:26:43.440 --> 00:26:49.840]   a very big problem with VR, which is the nausea problem. If you can see the real world, you don't
[00:26:49.840 --> 00:26:55.280]   get nauseated as quickly. Well, it might, you know, or as long as it represents it,
[00:26:55.280 --> 00:26:57.520]   because you're not looking at the real world, you're looking at video.
[00:26:57.520 --> 00:27:01.040]   I'll be worse if it's late. Yeah, if your head moves and then a second later,
[00:27:01.040 --> 00:27:05.360]   then the video moves, that's not going to work. It has to be very instantaneous.
[00:27:05.360 --> 00:27:10.080]   Or you will the car for sure. The other thing is, is that you could that when you talk about the
[00:27:10.080 --> 00:27:14.720]   table tennis, the other thing that they showed last year was all the collision surface issues,
[00:27:14.720 --> 00:27:18.720]   the collisions, collision surface processes. So you take your phone, wave it around.
[00:27:18.720 --> 00:27:24.800]   There's no reason why this device, as you start to walk, as soon as you put it on, it'll
[00:27:24.800 --> 00:27:29.280]   sure have LiDAR and everything else. It can build collision surfaces out of everything around you.
[00:27:29.280 --> 00:27:34.560]   So you could be, it's not just that you could be playing in the environment. It looks like the
[00:27:34.560 --> 00:27:40.000]   environment, but invisibly, you could be firing things and ducking behind you. Like imagine
[00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:44.480]   playing, you know, shooting like laser tag or something with your friends, and you could hide
[00:27:44.480 --> 00:27:48.400]   behind the couch. Like, you know, like, you know, that's there. So it gives you a lot of really
[00:27:48.400 --> 00:27:53.600]   interesting opportunities. Most of the seasickness actually really doesn't come from VR. It comes
[00:27:53.600 --> 00:27:57.680]   from the frame rate. So this gets back into why the frame rate has to be higher range. I'm
[00:27:57.680 --> 00:28:02.480]   just used to have this, they have had a test in Orlando. They bring poor college students in,
[00:28:02.480 --> 00:28:06.000]   and they would turn the frame rate down to see when they when they blew up.
[00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:10.960]   Because they're trying to figure out what's the minimum frame rate turns out. It's between 12
[00:28:10.960 --> 00:28:14.560]   and 18 frames. If you're 12, and you're 12 frames, you're a fighter pilot, you're 18,
[00:28:14.560 --> 00:28:21.760]   you're 16 frames per second, you're kind of average. And that somewhere there, you blow chunks.
[00:28:21.760 --> 00:28:27.360]   And so by the way, I contend that it is not merely frame rate. That's what I think all the
[00:28:27.360 --> 00:28:34.480]   headset manufacturers say, because it is the easiest thing for them to fix. It's not just latency.
[00:28:34.480 --> 00:28:39.360]   It's not the discrepancy between the, you know, two, two kinds of focus.
[00:28:39.360 --> 00:28:41.840]   What your inner ear is saying of what your eyes are saying.
[00:28:41.840 --> 00:28:46.560]   It's that, but also the fact that your eyes are focused on a near field object,
[00:28:46.560 --> 00:28:52.720]   but your head is looking at things at a distant object. And that mismatch is very hard to solve
[00:28:52.720 --> 00:28:58.320]   because those screens are right here. And I think that that's what Walter Merch, somebody pointed
[00:28:58.320 --> 00:29:04.160]   this out. And I think that that's perhaps more intractable. That's why they don't mention that.
[00:29:04.160 --> 00:29:10.880]   When we worked on that in the lab, a lot of it had to do with the fact that the latency is when
[00:29:10.880 --> 00:29:16.640]   we say seasick, what you're talking about, gay people headaches. So it was a different thing.
[00:29:16.640 --> 00:29:21.840]   You know, like, so the close frame, and some people get headaches from looking at that
[00:29:21.840 --> 00:29:26.320]   really there. But the seasickness seemed to be very related to inner ear,
[00:29:26.320 --> 00:29:33.680]   inner ear positions, because in for a million years, if your inner ear didn't agree with your
[00:29:33.680 --> 00:29:38.320]   eyes, you were being poisoned. And so that was the, so we're kind of just,
[00:29:39.120 --> 00:29:43.760]   I just every see the more the more I talk and think about about AR and VR, the more I realize
[00:29:43.760 --> 00:29:47.600]   how basic a lot of these problems are, where there's there's probably this little like
[00:29:47.600 --> 00:29:52.480]   tote board like in every lab saying, okay, are they getting headaches? Yes, no, are they
[00:29:52.480 --> 00:29:57.120]   are they vomiting? Yes, no. Are they peeing themselves? Damn, we still got to say that.
[00:29:57.120 --> 00:30:02.640]   We got to say that. Here's a crazy one. People with with blue eyes have different have
[00:30:02.640 --> 00:30:07.600]   responded to the screens differently than brown eyes. And so it's a funny, no, it's true. It's
[00:30:07.600 --> 00:30:13.280]   it's and so we you have different different more problems with people with blue eyes and clear eyes,
[00:30:13.280 --> 00:30:19.760]   like really bright blue eyes have more problems with the sets than brown eyes. And no one talks
[00:30:19.760 --> 00:30:24.640]   about that. I know there's a big thing. And you and you and you still have a problem of you have
[00:30:24.640 --> 00:30:28.640]   no peripheral vision. So there's always going to be the question of there. There's so many
[00:30:28.640 --> 00:30:32.880]   fundamental questions that can own are only going to be answered once we have these out there
[00:30:32.880 --> 00:30:38.000]   with the understanding that look, we have we don't know how to make this you can help us make it if
[00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:43.280]   you want to have this really great game platform, but also tell us like what's making you nauseous.
[00:30:43.280 --> 00:30:48.560]   I mean, on the we still one of the basic questions that we still have to ask is that like,
[00:30:48.560 --> 00:30:54.960]   when we're wearing these kind of devices, let's let's let's get augmented reality off the tables.
[00:30:54.960 --> 00:31:00.080]   We're not talking about like glasses with clear lenses and waveguides that you can actually really
[00:31:00.080 --> 00:31:04.960]   for real see the the world around you. Is it more appropriate to voluntarily say, hey,
[00:31:04.960 --> 00:31:09.200]   I'm putting on these goggles and therefore I'm entering an artificial environment with some
[00:31:09.200 --> 00:31:14.160]   awareness of the outside so they don't like put my put my fist through a wall unless I intend to do
[00:31:14.160 --> 00:31:19.520]   so? Or are we looking for out of an environment where this is going to be alongside what I do?
[00:31:19.520 --> 00:31:23.600]   So I'm going to have cameras that let me see the person who's sitting across the table, but we're
[00:31:23.600 --> 00:31:28.480]   both looking at this model that's on the physical table in front of us. These are things that we
[00:31:28.480 --> 00:31:34.880]   haven't figured out. And a lot of this is going to be how we decide things as as a society that
[00:31:34.880 --> 00:31:40.560]   when we have laptop when the conferences started and meetings started incorporating like laptops
[00:31:40.560 --> 00:31:44.560]   from laptops now have like all day battery. So of course, people are going to have their laptops
[00:31:44.560 --> 00:31:49.200]   with them. We kind of adjusted society to realize that, okay, I have a computer in front of me,
[00:31:49.200 --> 00:31:53.840]   but that doesn't mean I'm not paying attention. I'm just simply referring to notes so that I can
[00:31:53.840 --> 00:31:59.040]   answer questions for you or take notes as we go. So it's still a face-to-face meeting not through
[00:31:59.040 --> 00:32:04.000]   this technology. How are we going to adjust to these goggles? Are we going to be interacting
[00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:07.840]   with each other or are we going to be interacting through the technology? What's going to be
[00:32:07.840 --> 00:32:11.840]   fascinating by the next couple of years? And I do think that if you look at Apple, I think gave
[00:32:11.840 --> 00:32:16.080]   us some hints to this. If you go to the Apple store that's right outside the spaceship,
[00:32:16.080 --> 00:32:21.840]   they've got this thing of Apple campus where you can look through an iPad and you can look at it
[00:32:21.840 --> 00:32:28.880]   and adds all this extra data to it. So it's a very basic framework that they add everything on top of
[00:32:28.880 --> 00:32:32.480]   it. And so you can see how and they have a bunch of iPads going around the outside edge.
[00:32:32.480 --> 00:32:37.600]   I would not be surprised. I wouldn't say that I guarantee it, but I would not be surprised if
[00:32:37.600 --> 00:32:43.600]   the next demo of that is you put headsets on and you look at it and you just see it. And you can
[00:32:43.600 --> 00:32:49.280]   interact with it. Being able to grab onto your hands is really important. I mean, I was in SGI had a
[00:32:49.280 --> 00:32:53.840]   test of this 25 years ago where you could go like this, you could put your hands out and go,
[00:32:53.840 --> 00:32:59.360]   I want to sphere this big and just appear. Or you taste sphere like it wasn't. You couldn't say
[00:32:59.360 --> 00:33:05.040]   it. But it would pop up and you could just scale it and you could do all the things. And that was
[00:33:05.040 --> 00:33:09.760]   25 years ago. And I don't know, I probably had $20 million.
[00:33:09.760 --> 00:33:15.920]   I'll tell us to say that the one thing that I'm really looking forward to seeing Apple do is
[00:33:15.920 --> 00:33:19.840]   I don't really care so much about the hardware. I'm sure it's going to be fine. I don't know about
[00:33:19.840 --> 00:33:23.600]   entertainment or productivity. The one bit of this technology that I think that Apple can do a
[00:33:23.600 --> 00:33:30.640]   really wonderful thing with is simply hand tracking so that I no longer have to have any kind of
[00:33:30.640 --> 00:33:35.680]   control in your hand nor what I want to. I can pick up objects and just adjust your
[00:33:35.680 --> 00:33:42.400]   and be as make 3D gestures as important as the mouse was earlier on. But even then, now that I say
[00:33:42.400 --> 00:33:49.680]   that out loud, how do you make virtual reality usable by everybody, not just people who have
[00:33:49.680 --> 00:33:53.760]   full dexterity, but their hands? So God, there's so many unanswered questions here.
[00:33:53.760 --> 00:33:58.800]   And I do think we're on our way to you put the goggles on, whatever they're going to call them.
[00:33:58.800 --> 00:34:03.120]   And you are Tony Stark at some point. You know, like, give me this, rotate this around.
[00:34:03.120 --> 00:34:04.320]   Even better movies.
[00:34:04.320 --> 00:34:10.560]   But I'm just saying that it's that you have an iron man kind of like that's what you want to
[00:34:10.560 --> 00:34:13.680]   that's how you want to interact with things as you're trying to think through them.
[00:34:13.680 --> 00:34:18.640]   And being able to just kind of pull things apart and look at them, it does make a difference.
[00:34:18.640 --> 00:34:23.440]   Like when you can pull something apart and look at it, and I think that, you know, I could see,
[00:34:23.440 --> 00:34:29.920]   I know I know it will look goofy, but I can see Achaia giving me something. I put the goggles on
[00:34:29.920 --> 00:34:35.120]   and it says, okay, pick that up next. And now do this. And they can put on the little digital
[00:34:35.120 --> 00:34:42.480]   thing now with half the swearing. Not in the swearing, but just half of the swearing that's
[00:34:42.480 --> 00:34:47.040]   required to put together in Achaia furniture. But you could have a lot of instructions on how to do
[00:34:47.040 --> 00:34:51.360]   things and working with folks about it. I think it's going to be, again, I think Apple has done,
[00:34:51.360 --> 00:34:57.680]   if Apple, and they may fail, but if they fail, it's dead.
[00:34:57.680 --> 00:35:05.440]   If you did, if they can't make it work. I was showing USDZ, we were talking about USDZ in office hours
[00:35:05.440 --> 00:35:10.560]   this morning. And I was showing stuff that I suddenly realized that we made that three years ago.
[00:35:10.560 --> 00:35:15.440]   Like, you know, that was three years ago. And that was still like, you know, Apple, that was you
[00:35:15.440 --> 00:35:20.640]   at doing 3D models inside of motion, inside of, you know, like rotating around there, you know,
[00:35:20.640 --> 00:35:26.400]   you can open a USDZ model right now in, you can download a 3D model from the Smithsonian and open
[00:35:26.400 --> 00:35:32.720]   an in preview. And you have since 2020. So this is how long that runway has been to land this.
[00:35:32.720 --> 00:35:37.920]   And I think that, you know, I mean, Apple, I think was, you know, this is almost a 10 year project.
[00:35:37.920 --> 00:35:44.800]   If they, if they're, they've lined up as many ducks as you can line up without coming out of the gate.
[00:35:44.800 --> 00:35:48.560]   Like, I don't think that there's any. So if they can't figure it out, no one can, we can all give up
[00:35:48.560 --> 00:35:55.600]   and move on. We talk about Mark Zuckerberg and like him, and Tim Cook and Apple and Facebook,
[00:35:55.600 --> 00:35:59.680]   and do not track after tracking transparency, all these ways that they're battling and they're
[00:35:59.680 --> 00:36:06.560]   potentially battling here. But I would submit to you, nobody wants the Apple headset to succeed
[00:36:06.560 --> 00:36:12.720]   more than Mark Zuckerberg, because it validates his strategy and it validates this category.
[00:36:12.720 --> 00:36:18.400]   And I really, I agree with Alex completely. If Apple belly flops, it kills the category.
[00:36:18.400 --> 00:36:22.240]   Maybe it'll come back in 10 or 15 years, but it will, it will, it will murder it dead because no
[00:36:22.240 --> 00:36:26.640]   one will invest. If Apple can't make it work, nobody is going to invest in anyone else trying.
[00:36:26.640 --> 00:36:30.800]   And the crazy thing is, is that, that Facebook may just stop making headsets.
[00:36:30.800 --> 00:36:34.560]   Like they're not a hardware company, you know, and not a very good hardware company.
[00:36:34.560 --> 00:36:39.440]   And so, so the thing is, is that, is that nothing that they've done has been particularly successful
[00:36:39.440 --> 00:36:43.920]   when it comes to hardware. And so, you know, this may be they were working on working on working
[00:36:43.920 --> 00:36:47.600]   out now. It's on the Apple headset and they're like, Hey, why don't we just give up and use that?
[00:36:47.600 --> 00:36:52.000]   Yeah, if this could mean this, this could be a new message pad, where those of us who are into
[00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:55.520]   technology, we're like, Oh my God, this is groundbreaking. Oh my God, this is what the next
[00:36:55.520 --> 00:37:00.720]   generation computers computers can be. But then it was, it was fell flat because of a,
[00:37:00.720 --> 00:37:04.640]   they couldn't make a case for general use out of it. The general consumers,
[00:37:04.640 --> 00:37:09.600]   B, the components that they needed to make this really, really work well, the display technology,
[00:37:09.600 --> 00:37:13.760]   the battery technology, the wireless technology wasn't there yet. And the infrastructure wasn't
[00:37:13.760 --> 00:37:19.040]   there yet. So it's possible that Apple is really jumping early that they, they're,
[00:37:19.040 --> 00:37:24.720]   they're, there's squandering a chance to be, to absolutely run the table again, like in eight years
[00:37:24.720 --> 00:37:29.600]   because they're trying to get this happening like a year from now. And just like, just like,
[00:37:29.600 --> 00:37:33.280]   you know, you can't say the word Google Glass without the connotation of a loser.
[00:37:33.280 --> 00:37:37.760]   We don't want the that same connotation to have to this like early hardware.
[00:37:37.760 --> 00:37:40.560]   I do want to point out though, and we talked about this on Sunday on Twitch,
[00:37:41.360 --> 00:37:46.720]   and I own three message pads that, yes, the Newton, I guess you could say was,
[00:37:46.720 --> 00:37:52.720]   was an unqualified flop. But because of it, Apple formed Arm, the microprocessor company,
[00:37:52.720 --> 00:37:58.880]   they later sold off their stake and did basic and stuff that they needed to create 10 years later,
[00:37:58.880 --> 00:38:04.880]   the iPhone. And it might, this might actually be a very, I think it's a very
[00:38:06.240 --> 00:38:13.360]   apt analogy that that this could be the Newton of VR. And we may be 10 years off from what we all
[00:38:13.360 --> 00:38:18.480]   really want, which is augmented reality spectacles, you know, glasses that you can wear on your head.
[00:38:18.480 --> 00:38:27.280]   But if we put, if we continue the analogy, realize that the Newton was a big success for
[00:38:27.280 --> 00:38:29.200]   handspring. It was a really big success.
[00:38:29.200 --> 00:38:32.880]   Yeah, it was, it was, it showed a bunch of good ideas.
[00:38:32.880 --> 00:38:33.120]   Yeah.
[00:38:33.120 --> 00:38:38.400]   And then, and then Palm said, well, but what if we so a sold this for just for half the price
[00:38:38.400 --> 00:38:40.000]   and made it small and actually possible.
[00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:41.680]   Who's the John the Baptist of computers?
[00:38:41.680 --> 00:38:44.000]   And why not beheaded?
[00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:45.520]   Exactly.
[00:38:45.520 --> 00:38:46.800]   Exactly.
[00:38:46.800 --> 00:38:48.320]   Yeah.
[00:38:48.320 --> 00:38:49.600]   You nailed it, I think.
[00:38:49.600 --> 00:38:53.680]   And so that's not a bad, well, I guess from a business point of view, it's not a
[00:38:53.680 --> 00:38:56.960]   great place to be. But on the other hand, Microsoft has helped other people.
[00:38:56.960 --> 00:39:01.760]   I mean, Apple has enough money in the bank to survive 10 years and, and triumph.
[00:39:02.720 --> 00:39:06.160]   But I do think that it comes down to the prop, the performance.
[00:39:06.160 --> 00:39:10.080]   And I think that you've, as you read a lot of the behind the scenes of the ups and downs of some
[00:39:10.080 --> 00:39:15.520]   people wanting to be more wearable and at less performance. I think the design team
[00:39:15.520 --> 00:39:20.320]   wanted it to be more wearable and not worry about the performance as much as some of the other
[00:39:20.320 --> 00:39:25.840]   teams. And I'm, I hope that they hope that the performance is one because, yeah, yeah,
[00:39:25.840 --> 00:39:30.320]   because you got a, I mean, I think that it's, it's a really steep hill.
[00:39:30.320 --> 00:39:34.240]   If that frame rate is under 96 frames a second and it's a really steep hill.
[00:39:34.240 --> 00:39:40.000]   If the, if the resolution is under six, six K per eye, like that's, those are the, I think those
[00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:44.560]   are, those are par for them. I mean, that, that's that, you know, table stakes, you know, for,
[00:39:44.560 --> 00:39:48.240]   for what they have to do. And if they don't do that, it gets really hard because it just doesn't
[00:39:48.240 --> 00:39:52.240]   feel, doesn't feel well. It doesn't, there's all, a lot of the problems start going away with
[00:39:52.240 --> 00:39:55.840]   higher frame rate and higher resolution. Like it just, and it's just a matter of,
[00:39:56.480 --> 00:40:00.720]   it's, and it is a really hard thing. Like frame frame rate is not an easy problem.
[00:40:00.720 --> 00:40:05.440]   Is there any commercial so much data headset that met, that meets those goals now?
[00:40:05.440 --> 00:40:10.080]   There's no commercial headset that does that right. So it's your contention. The reason VR has
[00:40:10.080 --> 00:40:16.560]   failed up to now. One of the reasons is that one of the reasons is low frame rate and low and,
[00:40:16.560 --> 00:40:22.400]   and lower frame rate and lower resolution is a big piece of the puzzle. It is one of the people
[00:40:22.400 --> 00:40:26.160]   still get sick if the frame rates high and the rest of the time.
[00:40:26.160 --> 00:40:29.120]   Some people are always going to get sick. So there's, some people are just, they have a much
[00:40:29.120 --> 00:40:34.320]   more sensitive inner ear and they get sick when you get on a boat. I've seen that.
[00:40:34.320 --> 00:40:37.600]   So the Air Force said it's 11% of the popular ball. Let's say it's about
[00:40:37.600 --> 00:40:41.600]   get simulator sickness. I just saw an NIH study that said it's about 49%.
[00:40:41.600 --> 00:40:47.280]   Yeah, we, I think that, I think that in the stuff that we were working on a couple of years ago,
[00:40:47.280 --> 00:40:51.280]   it was, it was about 10%. Well, what's acceptable? 10% of the, if you,
[00:40:51.920 --> 00:40:55.680]   can you have a consumer product that makes 10% of the buyers sick?
[00:40:55.680 --> 00:40:59.920]   Oh, yeah. You can. Yeah, 100%. Oh, yeah. No one thinks that that's a stop.
[00:40:59.920 --> 00:41:04.720]   How far does corn syrup? Yeah. I mean, you know, it's the epicac of headsets.
[00:41:04.720 --> 00:41:10.480]   Yeah. I mean, there's a show that 10% wouldn't be that wouldn't know that's not the speed bump.
[00:41:10.480 --> 00:41:13.680]   Here's my pretty adoption or anything else. Here's my prediction. This is a flop,
[00:41:13.680 --> 00:41:21.440]   but Apple will snatch victory from the jaws of the nerd helmet years from now because it will be
[00:41:21.440 --> 00:41:27.200]   much like the Newton doing the groundwork for something that eventually will really be great,
[00:41:27.200 --> 00:41:30.320]   but it is years off because the technology's not there yet.
[00:41:30.320 --> 00:41:33.280]   Well, I don't think they're going to have a, I think I think them releasing a product will be
[00:41:33.280 --> 00:41:37.840]   years off like a commercial product is, is I think 18 to 24 months away.
[00:41:37.840 --> 00:41:42.880]   Even then, I don't think we're going to have the breakthroughs that we need to get it down to a
[00:41:42.880 --> 00:41:48.720]   small enough size to solve the issues. Maybe we will. We'll see in a week, but go ahead, Andy.
[00:41:48.720 --> 00:41:52.480]   Yeah. I agree with you. I don't think it's going to flop. I think it's going to have to,
[00:41:52.480 --> 00:41:56.880]   I think it's going to be a success by what Apple chooses to define as a success for this product.
[00:41:56.880 --> 00:42:02.320]   The thing is, in addition to what we've been saying about how Apple has $182 billion in cash
[00:42:02.320 --> 00:42:06.080]   according to the last quarterly report, they can, they can, they can,
[00:42:06.080 --> 00:42:11.120]   they can afford this. They can keep this going. But the, but the other advantage that this product
[00:42:11.120 --> 00:42:15.520]   category has is that if it doesn't, if it doesn't do anything with consumers,
[00:42:15.520 --> 00:42:20.720]   they can still eke out a victory by saying, hey, this is not, this unit is not necessarily
[00:42:20.720 --> 00:42:26.080]   making us a whole lot of money. But it is, but our, our friends in the military, our friends
[00:42:26.080 --> 00:42:32.320]   in medicine, our friends in training and education, all love this. And that's what Mike,
[00:42:32.320 --> 00:42:39.440]   by the way, Microsoft did didn't save Paul Owens. In fact, the army spent a billion dollars on
[00:42:39.440 --> 00:42:43.920]   all ends and canceled the contract. Yeah, but that, but that, that also shows you how good
[00:42:43.920 --> 00:42:47.360]   that kind of businesses, they get to keep getting paid for the contract. They got the
[00:42:47.360 --> 00:42:54.880]   bill. Yeah. Yeah. So, I think you watch very carefully the language that Apple uses on Monday,
[00:42:54.880 --> 00:43:01.360]   because I, I expect Apple to really downplay this. You agree, Jason?
[00:43:01.360 --> 00:43:06.560]   I mean, watch the language, watch the narrative being built here for sure, because those are
[00:43:06.560 --> 00:43:10.480]   going to be the key issues is, and then they'll tell us a lot about what Apple thinks this
[00:43:10.480 --> 00:43:14.400]   product is going to do, and when it's going to do, and who it's going to do it for,
[00:43:14.400 --> 00:43:18.880]   and how they feel about their prospects, that's all going to come down in the details of how the
[00:43:18.880 --> 00:43:24.640]   story is told, what they emphasize, who they emphasize that it's for. When it's supposedly
[00:43:24.640 --> 00:43:28.640]   coming out, are they going to say that this is the beginning? Are they going to, like, I, I think
[00:43:28.640 --> 00:43:32.800]   one of the real questions is, are they going to kind of break with tradition and say, where this
[00:43:32.800 --> 00:43:36.560]   is the first in a line of products and sort of promise that there will be more to come down the
[00:43:36.560 --> 00:43:40.400]   line that's more affordable? All of these things are kind of up in the air, but I think this is a
[00:43:40.400 --> 00:43:45.920]   huge messaging challenge for them. I think they're really downplay it. They say this is a developer
[00:43:45.920 --> 00:43:53.360]   tool. It's not the final product's not going to be anything like this. This is, so we can get this
[00:43:53.360 --> 00:43:58.160]   in the hands of developers. They can learn about XR, OS, the operating system. They can learn how
[00:43:58.160 --> 00:44:02.880]   to code for it. They can start developing games, games take four or five years. They can start
[00:44:02.880 --> 00:44:08.880]   working on products for it. But we see this as the first step in a very long journey.
[00:44:08.880 --> 00:44:14.240]   And this is not the final product, not even close. I hope they say that because I think
[00:44:14.240 --> 00:44:18.960]   that's the only right thing to say at this. Yeah. I mean, pick it back on something that Alex said
[00:44:18.960 --> 00:44:24.160]   earlier. I like the idea of Apple saying, hey, this is just, this is, we're only opening those
[00:44:24.160 --> 00:44:27.760]   for developers right now. So basically people who have a hundred bucks to spend a good fill out
[00:44:27.760 --> 00:44:33.200]   of form. But the idea is that if they can create this perception of limited access, it
[00:44:33.200 --> 00:44:39.280]   solves, it addresses a whole lot of vectors that they have to solve. And then later on,
[00:44:39.280 --> 00:44:44.320]   they can say, hey, we are the response to the response and the progress we've had on
[00:44:44.320 --> 00:44:49.200]   developing of apps is great. We've decided that we're going to open up a waiting list for ordinary
[00:44:49.200 --> 00:44:54.480]   people like you and me to go buy these things. So basically they have, they'll make a very ample
[00:44:54.480 --> 00:44:58.160]   initial run when they sell out of those. If it looks like they can sell more, they can say,
[00:44:58.160 --> 00:45:02.400]   hey, guess what? We've this is moving much, much faster than we thought was going to be.
[00:45:02.400 --> 00:45:09.120]   Here's another VR event to show off. So off a new portal that we have to demonstrate VR apps.
[00:45:09.120 --> 00:45:12.880]   And now we're going for the, if you want to spend the exact same price as developers,
[00:45:12.880 --> 00:45:17.200]   you no longer have to spend the $100 entry fee, the $100 tip to the concierge to get in.
[00:45:17.200 --> 00:45:22.320]   And I don't know whether Apple's going to, if Apple is going to be as aggressive as Epic.
[00:45:22.320 --> 00:45:26.080]   And Epic may get aggressive on its own of taking advantage of the headset.
[00:45:26.080 --> 00:45:33.680]   But I think that one of the things that Epic has done that's incredibly successful
[00:45:33.680 --> 00:45:40.080]   has been the Mega Grants. The Mega Grants, I mean, people, Epic and Unity were like in neck and neck,
[00:45:40.080 --> 00:45:44.240]   and no one knew which one was which. And Epic released the Mega Grants and everyone just
[00:45:44.240 --> 00:45:45.440]   forgot Unity existed.
[00:45:45.440 --> 00:45:46.560]   Looking in the developer world.
[00:45:46.560 --> 00:45:50.480]   Will Apple do something like Unity or will it be for the VR?
[00:45:50.480 --> 00:45:53.520]   Well, no, I don't know. I think they're going to build their own platform.
[00:45:53.520 --> 00:45:55.760]   I think that if they would have bought Unity, they would have bought it already.
[00:45:55.760 --> 00:46:00.000]   The problem is it's too big. Like Unity is like an, I think it's an 18 billion or 15 billion.
[00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:02.320]   They need a Unity 4 mixed reality.
[00:46:02.320 --> 00:46:07.120]   Yep. But I think Apple, I think Apple, when Epic went sideways, I think that,
[00:46:07.120 --> 00:46:12.320]   I bet you Apple looked at Unity and thought about it. And I think that the problem is,
[00:46:12.320 --> 00:46:17.760]   is Unity has an incredible amount of technology, but also a fair amount of technical debt.
[00:46:17.760 --> 00:46:21.360]   Right. And so in both Unity and Unreal have a lot of technical debt.
[00:46:21.360 --> 00:46:25.920]   So if you're building something this important to your pipeline, and I think that what Epic,
[00:46:25.920 --> 00:46:30.880]   because Apple was showing Epic at every keynote before they got into the lawsuit.
[00:46:30.880 --> 00:46:34.880]   You know, every keynote that someone from Unreal would come up and talk about and show us something
[00:46:34.880 --> 00:46:40.160]   that was cool and AR and everything else. And then that all died. And I think that the lesson for
[00:46:40.160 --> 00:46:45.360]   Apple to walk away from related to that was, we probably shouldn't put eggs into somebody else's
[00:46:45.360 --> 00:46:51.520]   basket. And so I have a feeling that, if you look at the development that Apple done around games,
[00:46:51.520 --> 00:46:56.640]   around a level of detail calculations, around a lot of things that are there, they've already
[00:46:56.640 --> 00:47:00.320]   shown those in developer conferences the last couple of years. I don't think that you'd build
[00:47:00.320 --> 00:47:04.640]   those if you think that you're going to, I don't think you build that if you're, if you are thinking
[00:47:04.640 --> 00:47:07.200]   of really handing it off to somebody else. I think they're going to have their own internal
[00:47:07.200 --> 00:47:11.040]   development tools. I think that I still think that Final Cut and Motion are probably going part
[00:47:11.040 --> 00:47:16.400]   of those development tools for video-based kind of things. I think that they bought into that a
[00:47:16.400 --> 00:47:21.840]   while ago. And we've got, we've seen tools added to those. We'll see what happens when it actually
[00:47:21.840 --> 00:47:27.520]   happens. Maybe they've given up on it, but they put a lot of VR tools into it. We have to remember
[00:47:27.520 --> 00:47:33.440]   that they bought next VR. So they've got a lot of things around video development that's there.
[00:47:33.440 --> 00:47:38.400]   So I think that I think Apple's going to probably try to manage their own
[00:47:40.080 --> 00:47:43.520]   destiny, so to speak, with that. And that's a hard road in a lot of ways, because
[00:47:43.520 --> 00:47:49.440]   years of development give you years of tools. So it's expensive. But I do think that the
[00:47:49.440 --> 00:47:53.840]   mega grants of getting people, getting developers out there saying, "Hey, we're developing this right
[00:47:53.840 --> 00:47:59.760]   now. You've got an idea. We've got money." We've got money to have you help us figure out what the
[00:47:59.760 --> 00:48:04.560]   next thing is. And we're going to spend, I think the mega grants are like $100 million a year.
[00:48:04.560 --> 00:48:09.040]   Apple could easily, it would be a rounding error for Apple to say, "We're going to
[00:48:09.040 --> 00:48:14.800]   see the market with a billion dollars a year of funding for people." And what really works
[00:48:14.800 --> 00:48:19.040]   with the mega grants is that there's no strings attached. They just give you the money.
[00:48:19.040 --> 00:48:24.160]   Like you said, you write them a proposal, and they just write you a check. I know a lot of people
[00:48:24.160 --> 00:48:29.200]   that have been pretty successful. I haven't done it. Keep on thinking about it. But they just give
[00:48:29.200 --> 00:48:32.720]   you the money to work with, and they're not asking for a percentage of your company. They're not
[00:48:32.720 --> 00:48:38.480]   asking. So it really is a great opportunity. And so I think that if Apple did a billion dollars a
[00:48:38.480 --> 00:48:42.800]   year of seed funding that was public like that, they'd get everybody thinking about it. So they
[00:48:42.800 --> 00:48:47.760]   have all these developers with developer kits with a very focused, like, "I could actually get
[00:48:47.760 --> 00:48:53.760]   money to hold me over for a year to work on this and to figure those things out." And it would
[00:48:53.760 --> 00:48:58.080]   benefit Apple a lot. So what they should have done with iBooks, they could have for not
[00:48:58.080 --> 00:49:01.920]   Dr. Pearson, they shouldn't have talked to Pearson. They should have just given book developers that
[00:49:01.920 --> 00:49:09.680]   they had given a billion dollars in 2010 to iBooks or whatever. We would not have regular books in the
[00:49:09.680 --> 00:49:14.560]   way that we think of them right now. And they also have a suite of apps that they can use as a
[00:49:14.560 --> 00:49:20.160]   bed to explain, "Hey, this is not just going to be a game platform. If you want it as a game platform,
[00:49:20.160 --> 00:49:24.960]   go to our Apple Arcade where we've funded a whole bunch of games." But it'd be interesting to see how
[00:49:24.960 --> 00:49:32.160]   they decide to get their chat app converted to VR, but also how do they get pages, how they get
[00:49:32.160 --> 00:49:39.120]   sheets, how they get keynote for heaven's sakes. I think that USDZ and keynote is in the short
[00:49:39.120 --> 00:49:44.720]   term is probably more exciting than the headset. And the reason for that is that there's so many of
[00:49:44.720 --> 00:49:49.520]   us that do presentations and we have to throw a throw through, we find a photo. And what I do a
[00:49:49.520 --> 00:49:54.880]   lot of times is I get 3D models of stuff. I take it into preview because I can open up a USDZ model
[00:49:54.880 --> 00:50:00.480]   in preview, rotate it to the angle that I needed in, and then hit save. And I put it into keynote.
[00:50:00.480 --> 00:50:05.280]   That's crazy. And so the thing is, is that you could be putting it in and as you do the presentation,
[00:50:05.280 --> 00:50:10.480]   you can have things animated, but even if they're not animated, even if they're just all still,
[00:50:10.480 --> 00:50:14.080]   it just means that you can choose the position and lighting of your object with a little drop
[00:50:14.080 --> 00:50:19.280]   shadow and everything else. Sitting inside your keynote, it's going to revolutionize that. But the
[00:50:19.280 --> 00:50:24.960]   biggest thing is that the size of the keynote market will create a huge demand for a clip art.
[00:50:24.960 --> 00:50:29.680]   So 3D clip art that's useful in the headset, that's useful in AR, it's useful in motion and
[00:50:29.680 --> 00:50:37.120]   everything else. Suddenly everyone buying up at $100 per model or $50 a model, you sell a certain
[00:50:37.120 --> 00:50:44.880]   number. If you have a collection of 25 models for 10 bucks that are like classroom models and
[00:50:45.440 --> 00:50:51.040]   anatomy models and all of those things, you could see a lot of people buying a lot of models.
[00:50:51.040 --> 00:50:55.360]   Yeah, but it also points out that it's not the elephant in the room, but it's something that's
[00:50:55.360 --> 00:50:59.920]   going to have an impact on all this. When we talk about what is the wave of the future,
[00:50:59.920 --> 00:51:07.040]   obviously it seems to be a fight between big companies between AR, VR and generative AI
[00:51:07.040 --> 00:51:11.840]   chatbots. And so on the other side of the coin, you've got Microsoft and Google demonstrating
[00:51:11.840 --> 00:51:16.160]   their AI upgrades to their own presentation apps that say, hey, you want a piece of art,
[00:51:16.160 --> 00:51:19.600]   tell us what you want, we'll generate it for you. In addition to stuff like
[00:51:19.600 --> 00:51:25.760]   the problem with generating a presentation and augmented reality is that everybody has to have
[00:51:25.760 --> 00:51:30.720]   that kind of hardware. Whereas given that this is the communication tool for pretty much every
[00:51:30.720 --> 00:51:35.200]   meeting and every project worldwide, the ability to say, hey, look, I'm just going to give you some
[00:51:35.200 --> 00:51:40.160]   loose notes. Can you turn this into a slide deck, at least the first draft of a slide deck for me.
[00:51:40.160 --> 00:51:45.840]   So as we go on, it's again, another part of this, I keep saying this is going to be the most
[00:51:45.840 --> 00:51:51.440]   interesting couple of years I will live through. The idea of Apple's Apple saying, hey, we put all
[00:51:51.440 --> 00:51:55.760]   this energy into augmented reality because that's going to be the next, oh, okay, we don't think
[00:51:55.760 --> 00:52:01.600]   that's going to be as big, but we think we can at least catch up in time. I will say that I mean,
[00:52:01.600 --> 00:52:07.360]   I already when I do slide decks, all of my illustrations are all a mid journey at this point. So I'm
[00:52:07.360 --> 00:52:11.200]   really, really good at using mid journey for all my slide decks, all my little examples and
[00:52:11.200 --> 00:52:15.840]   funny images and everything else are all generated in mid journey. But I will say it's like negotiating
[00:52:15.840 --> 00:52:22.240]   with your nephew that who's on mushrooms and you're going, so I want, I want this and he goes,
[00:52:22.240 --> 00:52:26.960]   you mean this and you're like, no, not that not that I want this and you're like, you mean this?
[00:52:26.960 --> 00:52:31.120]   No, no, like I think outside the box, we like to be a little closer to the box,
[00:52:31.120 --> 00:52:35.200]   get closer to the box. We'll tell you when to get a little your nephew on LSD is like super
[00:52:35.200 --> 00:52:40.480]   creative and super cool. But he just, but you have to keep on asking him questions for a little
[00:52:40.480 --> 00:52:43.760]   while before you get something pops out the other end. And then sometimes you ask it and you're like,
[00:52:43.760 --> 00:52:48.640]   oh, that's perfect. You know, and and anyway, so, so anyway, so it's, it's, so I think that that's
[00:52:48.640 --> 00:52:53.040]   the challenge with with gender AI right now. But I do think that, you know, we're, I think you're
[00:52:53.040 --> 00:52:56.800]   going to, I think you are going to get to a point even with Apple where you say, you know, it may not be,
[00:52:56.800 --> 00:53:02.640]   there's gender AI, but there's also like, I'm building out this thing and give me a chair here,
[00:53:02.640 --> 00:53:08.640]   you know, give me a thing here and that and maybe a bunch of chairs pop up and I can discuss it with
[00:53:08.640 --> 00:53:14.240]   with the system and throw those in. It may not be it's creating something out of nothing, but it's
[00:53:14.240 --> 00:53:21.360]   saying, would you like any of these, uh, Ikea chairs? Oh, yeah. Take that. Alex, you say people buy a
[00:53:21.360 --> 00:53:26.880]   lot of furniture all the time because that is, I, you know, she pretty sure I don't think that's,
[00:53:26.880 --> 00:53:28.720]   it's the hardest thing to buy.
[00:53:28.720 --> 00:53:33.040]   Okay. Fine. But you know, that's a terrible example because how often do people use those?
[00:53:33.040 --> 00:53:36.800]   No, no, I'm not talking about that. I'm not talking about buying it. I'm talking about just using it in
[00:53:36.800 --> 00:53:41.040]   your demonstration. So you want to fill out a room and you throw stuff in and brands. So like,
[00:53:41.040 --> 00:53:48.000]   for instance, it'll be great. So, no, no, no, no, no, but like, but the thing is, is that like,
[00:53:48.000 --> 00:53:53.680]   for instance, uh, Kina flow makes lights, makes the lights that you're under giving you that
[00:53:53.680 --> 00:53:56.720]   highlight that you don't like, um, the, am I wrong?
[00:53:56.720 --> 00:54:00.400]   All these lights is fine. It doesn't look any different than it has ever.
[00:54:00.400 --> 00:54:05.920]   I know. I just noticed it. That's all. So the, um, so the, uh, so Kina flow makes all these things.
[00:54:05.920 --> 00:54:09.440]   And what they did is they put their lights into SketchUp. I don't know if they did it or somebody
[00:54:09.440 --> 00:54:12.480]   else. I think I'm pretty sure that the company did it. Like somebody, the company modeled them
[00:54:12.480 --> 00:54:16.400]   all and added all the behaviors and did all the other things that were necessary so that you could
[00:54:16.400 --> 00:54:21.600]   take full advantage of Kina flows lights inside of SketchUp. And then we all used them. We all use
[00:54:21.600 --> 00:54:26.480]   those lights because those are the easiest ones to add to our, to our preview for showing a client
[00:54:26.480 --> 00:54:29.840]   what we were doing. And then once the client said, yeah, we want to do that project. Well,
[00:54:29.840 --> 00:54:34.480]   we just all rented or bought Pina Floss. We had, because it was easier to do it. So,
[00:54:34.480 --> 00:54:38.880]   so what I'm talking about is being able to add all these objects to it that are hundreds or
[00:54:38.880 --> 00:54:43.440]   thousands of objects that you can add in. And if you like it at some point, you're just previewing
[00:54:43.440 --> 00:54:49.600]   things, you're building virtual world, but instead of building them with generic, uh, generic
[00:54:49.600 --> 00:54:55.120]   furniture, like my, my daughter does interior. Oh, she did. She's, she's past Roblox now. She's,
[00:54:55.120 --> 00:55:00.880]   she's not into Minecraft. Um, and, um, but in Roblox, she was buying all this furniture. I was like,
[00:55:00.880 --> 00:55:07.120]   I can't believe that furniture companies aren't like just dumping Roblox with their furniture for
[00:55:07.120 --> 00:55:11.520]   people's houses so that kids get used to looking at their furniture rather than somebody else's
[00:55:11.520 --> 00:55:16.080]   furniture. So Jason, are you going to spend the night? You're going to go, I don't know,
[00:55:16.080 --> 00:55:20.320]   you can't tell me any of this, but just if you could, you're going Monday to Apple Park,
[00:55:20.320 --> 00:55:25.520]   you're going to be there at the event at the keynote. Yes. You can't tell. Yeah, I'll be there. You can.
[00:55:25.520 --> 00:55:28.720]   And then are you getting a hotel room and something? It's a secret. No, I'll be there. You're
[00:55:28.720 --> 00:55:34.160]   be there. And then you're going to come back the next day. Uh, I know you're not going to be here.
[00:55:34.160 --> 00:55:38.400]   I've been told to be present Monday and Tuesday for whatever they're going on. They don't tell
[00:55:38.400 --> 00:55:43.120]   you. They just say they don't, they don't tell me. Be here. You will, well, they could say you will
[00:55:43.120 --> 00:55:48.000]   want to be here. And that would be enough probably. I mean, they may have said that, but I mean,
[00:55:48.000 --> 00:55:51.120]   it's either way. You're going to be there. There's things happening. I'm going to be there.
[00:55:51.120 --> 00:55:56.080]   The new, the new Macbook Air comes in a, in a shade of gray that Jason, you have to see,
[00:55:56.080 --> 00:55:58.960]   see, believe, you're going to want to be there on Tuesday. So,
[00:55:58.960 --> 00:56:04.880]   Jason will not be here next week. Norm will be, he be here for our coverage, but Micah and I
[00:56:04.880 --> 00:56:10.800]   will be doing the keynote coverage. And we will be watching very carefully for the language and
[00:56:10.800 --> 00:56:14.720]   the wording. And that's one reason you might want to watch that coverage as opposed to just
[00:56:14.720 --> 00:56:19.440]   watching the keynote by itself. We're going to really look deeply at what they're saying about
[00:56:19.440 --> 00:56:26.240]   these products. 10 a.m. Pacific. That's 1 p.m. Eastern on Monday, a week from yesterday,
[00:56:26.240 --> 00:56:32.320]   June 5th for the Apple keynote. We might, I've done, last year, I kind of stuck around for the
[00:56:32.320 --> 00:56:37.120]   developer, the state of the union keynote, the next that afternoon. I may or may not,
[00:56:37.120 --> 00:56:42.000]   depending on how it feels. Sometimes it's interesting. Usually, some of the fun is,
[00:56:42.000 --> 00:56:46.640]   oh, Apple didn't announce something, but oh, look what they're talking about in the, in the, in the
[00:56:46.640 --> 00:56:50.720]   user sessions and in the state of the, state of the union. But now it's like, what could they not
[00:56:50.720 --> 00:56:56.160]   be talking about? That would be more interesting than the key than the highlight. Will they put it
[00:56:56.160 --> 00:57:00.000]   the start? Will they put it the start? Will they put it the, I bet it, I bet it comes at the end
[00:57:00.000 --> 00:57:04.880]   because if they really are like introducing a few new Macs, like no one's going to pay attention
[00:57:04.880 --> 00:57:08.960]   afterward, everyone's going to be, you know, you don't put Diana Ross, like at the start of the
[00:57:08.960 --> 00:57:12.400]   show, you put her at the end of the show, or else, otherwise nobody's going to stand, and those guys
[00:57:12.400 --> 00:57:16.560]   hang around to see the comic. They always, the rumors start to heat up roundabout now.
[00:57:16.560 --> 00:57:23.120]   Saturday, Mark Gurman tweeted, Apple will start accepting trade-ins of the Mac studio,
[00:57:23.120 --> 00:57:31.760]   the 13 inch M2 MacBook Air and the 13 inch M2 MacBook Pro on to, to, to, to, June 5th. Read
[00:57:31.760 --> 00:57:38.080]   into that as you will. He says, I will, I will, I am expecting. I don't think it's, I don't think
[00:57:38.080 --> 00:57:44.560]   it's anything, but I mean, right? Nothing into it. They don't always coincide with product launches,
[00:57:44.560 --> 00:57:48.160]   and it may just be that that's a banner day for Apple, and so they're going to hit the reset button
[00:57:48.160 --> 00:57:55.360]   on that day. Like Andy said, I don't know why you would trickle out a few Macs just before
[00:57:55.360 --> 00:58:01.120]   announcing your brand new platform. Like that's a weird choice to, to dilute the message
[00:58:01.120 --> 00:58:05.280]   in when you could just wait a couple of weeks and get everybody to focus on it.
[00:58:05.280 --> 00:58:09.200]   Do you think that they will say nothing about anything except the nerd helmet?
[00:58:09.200 --> 00:58:14.080]   No, oh no, it'll be a WWC keynote, right? So they're going to talk about the new versions of
[00:58:14.080 --> 00:58:17.520]   the, all the operating systems for sure. iOS, iOS, iOS, iOS, iOS, gaming.
[00:58:17.520 --> 00:58:22.400]   I think that's why the Mac OS did the union or the platform city of the union is what it
[00:58:22.400 --> 00:58:27.440]   isn't called now. Might be more interesting than usual because I wonder if they're just not going
[00:58:27.440 --> 00:58:31.360]   to have enough time to push that stuff over to there to put a lot of detail about what's
[00:58:31.360 --> 00:58:36.800]   happening and all the different new OS versions come to fall, which a lot of us really care about.
[00:58:36.800 --> 00:58:42.480]   So I wouldn't be surprised about that. I would be, I'm going to say it, I would be legitimately
[00:58:42.480 --> 00:58:50.240]   surprised if they basically blow a Mac launch by announcing it at the beginning of an event
[00:58:50.240 --> 00:58:54.880]   where everybody's just going to be talking about the headset. Like why would you do it then?
[00:58:54.880 --> 00:59:00.800]   Yeah. Unless, unless it, the headset is, I mean, one possibility, just kind of brainstorming here,
[00:59:00.800 --> 00:59:07.340]   is that the headset they're taking their foot off the gas of the headset and they're really going to make it a developer preview.
[00:59:07.340 --> 00:59:12.160]   And they're going to just do a little tiny bit and they know when they launch it later, they'll talk about it more.
[00:59:12.160 --> 00:59:19.100]   There could be reasons that they want to kind of, like, try to deemphasize it, but I think that they're kidding themselves if they're trying that.
[00:59:19.100 --> 00:59:23.120]   Because the fact is if they do anything about the headset, the headset is the headline.
[00:59:23.120 --> 00:59:24.760]   The headset is the sub-head.
[00:59:24.760 --> 00:59:26.880]   The headset is the first 20 paragraphs.
[00:59:26.880 --> 00:59:28.700]   The headset is the sidebar article.
[00:59:28.700 --> 00:59:30.400]   The headset is the third article, right?
[00:59:30.400 --> 00:59:36.960]   So if you don't introduce a Mac on Monday, just don't do it because nobody's going to care.
[00:59:36.960 --> 00:59:41.180]   Yeah, we're not going to hear much about the new Apple Flag Shift Store and South Adlboro, Massachusetts.
[00:59:41.180 --> 00:59:44.320]   It's just, you know, you're going to have to go to the website for that, frankly.
[00:59:44.320 --> 00:59:46.000]   But maybe, you know what?
[00:59:46.000 --> 00:59:51.020]   Now I'm thinking maybe we'll stick around and do the State of the Union because...
[00:59:51.020 --> 00:59:54.960]   Are they going to do this like they did last year, Jason?
[00:59:54.960 --> 00:59:55.400]   Do you know?
[00:59:55.400 --> 00:59:56.400]   I mean, what is...
[00:59:56.400 --> 00:59:57.400]   Is it open to the...
[00:59:57.400 --> 00:59:58.400]   It's not open...
[00:59:58.400 --> 01:00:03.400]   It's not. It's a small invite-only group of developers who've been told to come and then
[01:00:03.400 --> 01:00:05.960]   members of the media and VIPs who've been told to come.
[01:00:05.960 --> 01:00:07.080]   We don't even know where we're going.
[01:00:07.080 --> 01:00:10.200]   Last year, we didn't know that we were going to be in the ring, but we actually were in
[01:00:10.200 --> 01:00:14.280]   the Cafe Max sort of pointed out of the ring, but in the ring building.
[01:00:14.280 --> 01:00:15.280]   This year, we also don't know.
[01:00:15.280 --> 01:00:18.360]   I mean, I think there's a possibility it could be identical to last year and we'll all be
[01:00:18.360 --> 01:00:22.160]   in that Cafe Max space looking at a Jumbotron, essentially, that's playing the video.
[01:00:22.160 --> 01:00:25.120]   Were you inside the Cafe Max or are you outside?
[01:00:25.120 --> 01:00:29.200]   Well, I was sort of right on the border because what it was, the front rows were out in the
[01:00:29.200 --> 01:00:33.200]   sun, but there were enough people there that you went all the way back and the Cafe Max...
[01:00:33.200 --> 01:00:34.200]   They opened the window.
[01:00:34.200 --> 01:00:35.200]   They opened the whole...
[01:00:35.200 --> 01:00:37.640]   It's open air, so they opened the whole thing on the outside.
[01:00:37.640 --> 01:00:40.720]   So we were kind of like rolling back into the Cafe.
[01:00:40.720 --> 01:00:44.640]   It's also possible that they'll do it in the Steve Jobs Theater.
[01:00:44.640 --> 01:00:47.760]   It's possible that they'll put the developers out of Cafe Max and they'll have the press
[01:00:47.760 --> 01:00:52.240]   go to the Steve Jobs Theater because if we're all just watching a video, they could split
[01:00:52.240 --> 01:00:53.400]   us up if they wanted to.
[01:00:53.400 --> 01:00:54.400]   That's the mystery.
[01:00:54.400 --> 01:00:56.840]   I don't know anything about that, but it's going to be a small group.
[01:00:56.840 --> 01:01:02.800]   It'll be more like last year than any other year, probably all pre-taped.
[01:01:02.800 --> 01:01:09.080]   It's a small event and then the developers have also been told, and this was reported
[01:01:09.080 --> 01:01:12.600]   to make time on Tuesday for something.
[01:01:12.600 --> 01:01:16.080]   The guess is that this headset is going to take that much time to roll out to people
[01:01:16.080 --> 01:01:20.080]   because, again, you can't really just put it on a table and say, "Everybody look.
[01:01:20.080 --> 01:01:22.000]   You've got to cycle people through."
[01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:26.240]   So it may take days or who knows, maybe we'll just only Tuesday to pick up that 15-inch
[01:01:26.240 --> 01:01:27.240]   MacBook Air.
[01:01:27.240 --> 01:01:28.240]   Maybe.
[01:01:28.240 --> 01:01:31.600]   No, I think that's why I'm asking.
[01:01:31.600 --> 01:01:34.400]   Yeah, Tuesday's a headset demo, isn't it?
[01:01:34.400 --> 01:01:39.960]   By the way, Alex, I think your LSD adult nephew did, in fact, design the homepage for
[01:01:39.960 --> 01:01:43.160]   WWDC.
[01:01:43.160 --> 01:01:47.440]   It's trippy to say the least.
[01:01:47.440 --> 01:01:49.320]   The melting apple.
[01:01:49.320 --> 01:01:53.840]   I think if you look at it on an iPhone, there's a VR.
[01:01:53.840 --> 01:01:54.840]   Am I right?
[01:01:54.840 --> 01:01:56.360]   There's a VR version of this or no?
[01:01:56.360 --> 01:01:59.560]   There's usually an AR object that they put them in the AR.
[01:01:59.560 --> 01:02:00.560]   Yeah, AR.
[01:02:00.560 --> 01:02:01.560]   Yeah.
[01:02:01.560 --> 01:02:02.560]   I don't know.
[01:02:02.560 --> 01:02:04.280]   I don't know how I would make this happen.
[01:02:04.280 --> 01:02:05.280]   You've got to be in Safari.
[01:02:05.280 --> 01:02:07.080]   If you're in Safari, yeah.
[01:02:07.080 --> 01:02:08.080]   I love her.
[01:02:08.080 --> 01:02:12.000]   If you're a MacBook display exhibit at these tendencies, take it right back to the Apple
[01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:16.680]   store for a free screen replacement within 18 months after the purchase date.
[01:02:16.680 --> 01:02:18.480]   Is trippy, man?
[01:02:18.480 --> 01:02:21.280]   It's really getting watched this.
[01:02:21.280 --> 01:02:24.080]   It doesn't look like a finger being squished in an LCD screen.
[01:02:24.080 --> 01:02:25.080]   That's what it looks like.
[01:02:25.080 --> 01:02:26.080]   Oh, yeah.
[01:02:26.080 --> 01:02:27.640]   Yeah, that's not good.
[01:02:27.640 --> 01:02:29.600]   Don't let that happen to your LCD.
[01:02:29.600 --> 01:02:35.920]   That's what everything will look like after spending at least two hours with the headset.
[01:02:35.920 --> 01:02:36.880]   Everything is just a free-
[01:02:36.880 --> 01:02:38.600]   What are they trying to say with this?
[01:02:38.600 --> 01:02:41.960]   I don't get it.
[01:02:41.960 --> 01:02:43.720]   We know how to make a cool Apple logo.
[01:02:43.720 --> 01:02:46.400]   We could do a rock and roll light show.
[01:02:46.400 --> 01:02:51.040]   I feel like Jim Morrison should be on stage singing.
[01:02:51.040 --> 01:02:54.520]   ♪ Pick on through to the other side ♪
[01:02:54.520 --> 01:02:58.120]   I honestly wish that the team that does these animations for the for the keynotes and stuff
[01:02:58.120 --> 01:03:01.600]   like that, I wish they would make new screen savers because there's so many cool things
[01:03:01.600 --> 01:03:02.600]   that I've seen in these things.
[01:03:02.600 --> 01:03:03.600]   Yeah.
[01:03:03.600 --> 01:03:05.600]   But I would love to see.
[01:03:05.600 --> 01:03:08.800]   Maybe that's what these are is the frustrated screen saver makers.
[01:03:08.800 --> 01:03:09.800]   Yeah.
[01:03:09.800 --> 01:03:12.040]   They only get one screen saver every year.
[01:03:12.040 --> 01:03:15.000]   They're not fitting until they get their--
[01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:16.000]   Sorry, go ahead.
[01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:25.920]   The Swifties have received their passports to WWDC, the Swift Student Challenge winners.
[01:03:25.920 --> 01:03:26.920]   Yeah.
[01:03:26.920 --> 01:03:31.400]   Here are three of them, Marta, Yemi and Azmi.
[01:03:31.400 --> 01:03:37.480]   As usual, they'll do the show off what these kids have done.
[01:03:37.480 --> 01:03:42.560]   Azmi, Jane, found out her friend's uncle had to undergo brain surgery.
[01:03:42.560 --> 01:03:46.920]   She was a student at MediCaps University in Indoor, India.
[01:03:46.920 --> 01:03:53.280]   So she sprang into action, designing her winning Swift Playground Attracket User's Eye movements
[01:03:53.280 --> 01:03:57.240]   as they try to follow a ball moving around the screen designed to help strengthen the
[01:03:57.240 --> 01:03:58.240]   eye muscles.
[01:03:58.240 --> 01:04:02.560]   I wonder if these are all going to be kind of-- that would sure be better if you could
[01:04:02.560 --> 01:04:06.160]   put a helmet on.
[01:04:06.160 --> 01:04:10.760]   Here's a 21-year-old Yemi Agassen.
[01:04:10.760 --> 01:04:15.200]   He is a student at Kennesaw State University in Georgia.
[01:04:15.200 --> 01:04:19.840]   He designed a first-person baseball game.
[01:04:19.840 --> 01:04:21.760]   Hmm.
[01:04:21.760 --> 01:04:26.200]   I bet you all of these would look really good in a headset.
[01:04:26.200 --> 01:04:31.200]   Marie-- I'm sorry, Marta and Michelle Caliendo, 25 years old.
[01:04:31.200 --> 01:04:34.000]   She's fascinated with fossils.
[01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:36.520]   She's studying at the Apple Developer Academy in Naples.
[01:04:36.520 --> 01:04:37.520]   Nice.
[01:04:37.520 --> 01:04:38.920]   Is it Naples, Florida or Naples, Italy?
[01:04:38.920 --> 01:04:40.600]   I think it's Naples, Italy.
[01:04:40.600 --> 01:04:41.920]   No, I don't know.
[01:04:41.920 --> 01:04:46.240]   Yeah, University of Naples, Fradorico, Due.
[01:04:46.240 --> 01:04:50.320]   Coding helps me find new ways to express and share that message with others.
[01:04:50.320 --> 01:04:55.960]   Her Playground is a memory game featuring anatomically-- well, excuse me, I'm sorry,
[01:04:55.960 --> 01:05:00.160]   your kids-- anatomically correct pictures of dinosaur fossils.
[01:05:00.160 --> 01:05:05.680]   She drew them in Procreate, made all the more impressive, because she'd only learned Swift
[01:05:05.680 --> 01:05:07.240]   in September.
[01:05:07.240 --> 01:05:08.240]   Yeah.
[01:05:08.240 --> 01:05:11.560]   So I like those three winners.
[01:05:11.560 --> 01:05:15.080]   Sometimes when you have these programming contests, they want to get the people that
[01:05:15.080 --> 01:05:19.920]   are like, oh, well, I got my PhD in 814.
[01:05:19.920 --> 01:05:21.880]   My Swift F is about protein unfolding.
[01:05:21.880 --> 01:05:26.800]   Well, give me someone who has a good science head, a really good creative head, and one
[01:05:26.800 --> 01:05:31.520]   who just had-- here is my quirk and things I'm really, really interested in.
[01:05:31.520 --> 01:05:36.440]   And I'm not the sort of person who would make a game based on fossils, but here we are,
[01:05:36.440 --> 01:05:39.960]   because of the power and the majesty of Swift Coding.
[01:05:39.960 --> 01:05:44.400]   Anatomically correct fossils, I might add.
[01:05:44.400 --> 01:05:50.200]   The baseball game designer says, he's eager to add ARKit and RealityKit to his growing
[01:05:50.200 --> 01:05:51.200]   toolbox.
[01:05:51.200 --> 01:05:52.200]   I bet you are.
[01:05:52.200 --> 01:05:56.680]   I wonder if they're going to get seeded with hardware.
[01:05:56.680 --> 01:05:57.680]   Wouldn't that be fun?
[01:05:57.680 --> 01:05:58.680]   Oh.
[01:05:58.680 --> 01:05:59.680]   I want to see some kids get these--
[01:05:59.680 --> 01:06:00.680]   I hope so.
[01:06:00.680 --> 01:06:01.680]   Yeah.
[01:06:01.680 --> 01:06:04.320]   I think that should be part of their prize.
[01:06:04.320 --> 01:06:05.320]   Don't you?
[01:06:05.320 --> 01:06:06.320]   Yeah.
[01:06:06.320 --> 01:06:07.320]   Yes.
[01:06:07.320 --> 01:06:11.880]   Swift student challenge winners will be at WWDC.
[01:06:11.880 --> 01:06:16.760]   Also, Apple has not yet announced the design winners, but they'll announce those on Monday
[01:06:16.760 --> 01:06:17.760]   too.
[01:06:17.760 --> 01:06:18.760]   Is that right?
[01:06:18.760 --> 01:06:19.760]   I think they do that every day.
[01:06:19.760 --> 01:06:20.760]   I think so.
[01:06:20.760 --> 01:06:21.760]   Yeah.
[01:06:21.760 --> 01:06:22.760]   Well, I'm really excited.
[01:06:22.760 --> 01:06:24.240]   I-- oh, what's this?
[01:06:24.240 --> 01:06:26.200]   Oh, he's found the Apple.
[01:06:26.200 --> 01:06:28.160]   It's floating over my head.
[01:06:28.160 --> 01:06:29.560]   Ah, ah.
[01:06:29.560 --> 01:06:33.280]   Does end digestion keep you up at night?
[01:06:33.280 --> 01:06:37.160]   With new strawberry flavor.
[01:06:37.160 --> 01:06:38.160]   That's cool.
[01:06:38.160 --> 01:06:42.640]   Anthony Nielsen has put that on his iPhone and is now projecting.
[01:06:42.640 --> 01:06:43.640]   You know, the smelting apple.
[01:06:43.640 --> 01:06:49.400]   The sting of the jelly apple is known to be toxic to 83% of all land mammals.
[01:06:49.400 --> 01:06:50.400]   Yeah.
[01:06:50.400 --> 01:06:52.400]   Get it off of me.
[01:06:52.400 --> 01:06:53.400]   Thank you, Anthony.
[01:06:53.400 --> 01:06:54.400]   It's very vinegar.
[01:06:54.400 --> 01:06:55.400]   Well done.
[01:06:55.400 --> 01:06:56.400]   Very nice.
[01:06:56.400 --> 01:07:00.080]   Anthony Nielsen leaping into the fray.
[01:07:00.080 --> 01:07:03.040]   Anything else to say about my-- like I said, I'm really excited.
[01:07:03.040 --> 01:07:09.520]   It's always cool when Apple has a keynote, extra cool when Apple announces not just new
[01:07:09.520 --> 01:07:14.360]   products in an existing category, but new categories entirely.
[01:07:14.360 --> 01:07:15.360]   Yeah.
[01:07:15.360 --> 01:07:18.520]   And they haven't done that since the watch, I think, right?
[01:07:18.520 --> 01:07:19.520]   Yeah.
[01:07:19.520 --> 01:07:20.520]   It's going to be good.
[01:07:20.520 --> 01:07:24.400]   It's going to be entertaining and a lot of fodder for conversation regardless of what
[01:07:24.400 --> 01:07:25.400]   everybody feels about it.
[01:07:25.400 --> 01:07:27.760]   Yeah, thank God, because these shows are really getting scant.
[01:07:27.760 --> 01:07:30.400]   Well, this is the time of year.
[01:07:30.400 --> 01:07:31.400]   Yeah.
[01:07:31.400 --> 01:07:32.400]   No, I'm kidding.
[01:07:32.400 --> 01:07:34.120]   I'm not going to be a conversation.
[01:07:34.120 --> 01:07:38.360]   I'm going to pause for a moment to let you gentlemen wet your whistles, if that's what
[01:07:38.360 --> 01:07:39.720]   you call them.
[01:07:39.720 --> 01:07:43.520]   But we'll be back with other stories.
[01:07:43.520 --> 01:07:46.120]   There's more in the Mac and Apple world.
[01:07:46.120 --> 01:07:53.600]   But first, a plea, a beg, a respectful ask.
[01:07:53.600 --> 01:07:56.040]   This show has no ads.
[01:07:56.040 --> 01:08:04.560]   The ad market, and I've talked to so many podcasters and so many big podcasting companies, is struggling.
[01:08:04.560 --> 01:08:06.280]   Let's be honest.
[01:08:06.280 --> 01:08:07.880]   And I don't know why that is.
[01:08:07.880 --> 01:08:09.600]   Is it recession?
[01:08:09.600 --> 01:08:12.120]   Is it post COVID hangover?
[01:08:12.120 --> 01:08:16.440]   But companies are not buying podcast ads like they used to.
[01:08:16.440 --> 01:08:22.600]   And when a show doesn't have any ads, that means it's out of pocket for us.
[01:08:22.600 --> 01:08:27.320]   Unless we can convince you to help out a little bit.
[01:08:27.320 --> 01:08:32.520]   So I know, hey, I know we're not Jerry's kids, but $7 a month keeps the lights on, keeps
[01:08:32.520 --> 01:08:40.040]   the shows flowing, keeps our team employed, keeps our hosts getting their stipends.
[01:08:40.040 --> 01:08:43.640]   It's a little small amount to pay, but you get a great benefit, I think.
[01:08:43.640 --> 01:08:48.720]   Add free versions of all of our shows plus shows we don't put out, except to the club,
[01:08:48.720 --> 01:08:51.720]   like hands on Macintosh with Micah Sergeant.
[01:08:51.720 --> 01:08:56.800]   We put out occasional episodes of that for the public to consume on our YouTube channel.
[01:08:56.800 --> 01:09:00.920]   But the full set of weekly shows is only available to club members, same with hands
[01:09:00.920 --> 01:09:03.240]   on Windows with Paul Therat.
[01:09:03.240 --> 01:09:05.560]   We brought back Scott Wilkinson's home theater geek.
[01:09:05.560 --> 01:09:09.960]   So show again that we really loved doing, but couldn't afford to do until the club came
[01:09:09.960 --> 01:09:10.960]   along.
[01:09:10.960 --> 01:09:14.400]   Plus, great events going on in our Discord.
[01:09:14.400 --> 01:09:19.480]   The Discord is the best social network ever.
[01:09:19.480 --> 01:09:23.760]   I've become a Discord fan and we have events in the Discord.
[01:09:23.760 --> 01:09:28.000]   For instance, you can join us with the keynote in the live stream.
[01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:29.920]   You can watch the home theater geeks recordings.
[01:09:29.920 --> 01:09:34.440]   We've got a fireside chat coming up with Floss Weekly's Sean Powers.
[01:09:34.440 --> 01:09:37.440]   Stacey's book club is really a great book.
[01:09:37.440 --> 01:09:39.640]   Right, John, you were really loving the Terraformers.
[01:09:39.640 --> 01:09:41.680]   Annalyn Neuitz is new book.
[01:09:41.680 --> 01:09:48.040]   We're going to have a it looks like booze soaked inside Twit.
[01:09:48.040 --> 01:09:52.280]   Last month and a fireside chat with Rod Pyle.
[01:09:52.280 --> 01:09:55.480]   Rod Pyle is a great example of what the club hath wrought.
[01:09:55.480 --> 01:09:57.000]   We wouldn't have this week in space.
[01:09:57.000 --> 01:10:01.920]   We launched it, so to speak, in the club because it was a brand new show and we knew
[01:10:01.920 --> 01:10:06.240]   there'd be no audience yet, no advertisers yet to support it.
[01:10:06.240 --> 01:10:11.200]   But as it grew in the club and it grew its audience, Terrick Malek, the editor in chief
[01:10:11.200 --> 01:10:18.880]   of space.com, Rod Pyle, editor in chief of the National Space Society's publication,
[01:10:18.880 --> 01:10:20.440]   really do a great job.
[01:10:20.440 --> 01:10:21.440]   They grew the audience.
[01:10:21.440 --> 01:10:22.440]   They grew the advertisers.
[01:10:22.440 --> 01:10:25.560]   We were able to put it out in the public and again, that's thanks to the club.
[01:10:25.560 --> 01:10:31.560]   So if you are at all interested, you can find out all the pricing details on the page.
[01:10:31.560 --> 01:10:36.480]   One thing though, please tell your wife if you buy it.
[01:10:36.480 --> 01:10:40.920]   We got to charge back the other day because the guy subscribed to the club.
[01:10:40.920 --> 01:10:45.320]   I think he bought the $84 full year package, right?
[01:10:45.320 --> 01:10:49.800]   Without telling his wife and the wife issued a charge back, disputed it and we had to give
[01:10:49.800 --> 01:10:53.440]   them the money back and then we got a ding from Stripe.
[01:10:53.440 --> 01:10:55.040]   It's become a whole hassle.
[01:10:55.040 --> 01:11:00.920]   So please don't surprise your spouse with this purchase unless it's a gift.
[01:11:00.920 --> 01:11:04.640]   But chargebacks really can be a problem.
[01:11:04.640 --> 01:11:05.720]   We don't want too many of those.
[01:11:05.720 --> 01:11:11.720]   So only if you know, I really want this, Twit.tv/club to it.
[01:11:11.720 --> 01:11:13.080]   It really does help us out.
[01:11:13.080 --> 01:11:15.480]   Seven bucks a month, 84 bucks a year.
[01:11:15.480 --> 01:11:18.560]   There's family plans, discounted family plans.
[01:11:18.560 --> 01:11:24.000]   There's also, there's also corporate plans.
[01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:28.000]   We actually have quite a few corporate members which we thank you for that.
[01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:29.240]   Twit.tv/club.
[01:11:29.240 --> 01:11:31.240]   Twit, please.
[01:11:31.240 --> 01:11:34.920]   Communication is so important in our relationship.
[01:11:34.920 --> 01:11:35.920]   Tell your spouse.
[01:11:35.920 --> 01:11:37.120]   It was a funny story.
[01:11:37.120 --> 01:11:37.960]   I mean, it was a funny story.
[01:11:37.960 --> 01:11:40.960]   I feel bad for both parties.
[01:11:40.960 --> 01:11:45.920]   But it's a lot of work and a chargeback is apparently a very bad thing.
[01:11:45.920 --> 01:11:46.920]   I don't know.
[01:11:46.920 --> 01:11:53.600]   I think we have enough chargebacks now that we're starting to get the stink guy from a
[01:11:53.600 --> 01:11:55.320]   member full in the Stripe.
[01:11:55.320 --> 01:11:57.720]   Stripe does the transactions.
[01:11:57.720 --> 01:12:01.640]   Twit.tv/club to it.
[01:12:01.640 --> 01:12:05.240]   Because Andy, Andy needs new shoes.
[01:12:05.240 --> 01:12:06.240]   Right?
[01:12:06.240 --> 01:12:07.240]   Actually, actually I do.
[01:12:07.240 --> 01:12:08.240]   I'm barefoot.
[01:12:08.240 --> 01:12:09.240]   I'm doing this without shoes.
[01:12:09.240 --> 01:12:12.240]   I'm shoeless Andy during the show.
[01:12:12.240 --> 01:12:13.240]   Apple is shutting down.
[01:12:13.240 --> 01:12:14.440]   I don't know if this is good or bad.
[01:12:14.440 --> 01:12:15.440]   I asked around.
[01:12:15.440 --> 01:12:16.440]   I don't know.
[01:12:16.440 --> 01:12:20.880]   Apple is shutting down my photo stream next month.
[01:12:20.880 --> 01:12:23.640]   You're supposed to use iCloud photos instead.
[01:12:23.640 --> 01:12:27.240]   I don't, I dimly remember this thing called my photo stream.
[01:12:27.240 --> 01:12:32.120]   It would allow you to kind of upstream as many as a thousand photos.
[01:12:32.120 --> 01:12:37.640]   They had to be within the last 30 days and the new ones would replace the old ones.
[01:12:37.640 --> 01:12:39.480]   I guess people use iCloud photos.
[01:12:39.480 --> 01:12:44.360]   Anyway, Apple is going to say, "Tell you if you are using my photo stream that you can
[01:12:44.360 --> 01:12:48.360]   no longer upload to my photo stream on June 26th.
[01:12:48.360 --> 01:12:54.560]   Images will remain in iCloud as usual for 30 days and then on July 26th, bye bye.
[01:12:54.560 --> 01:12:55.560]   My photo stream.
[01:12:55.560 --> 01:12:56.720]   Did anybody use this?
[01:12:56.720 --> 01:13:01.680]   Yeah, this was their iCloud photo solution for many years until they came up with iCloud
[01:13:01.680 --> 01:13:05.280]   photo library, which itself was a long time ago now.
[01:13:05.280 --> 01:13:07.880]   That was like seven or eight years ago.
[01:13:07.880 --> 01:13:10.080]   Yeah, it used to be.
[01:13:10.080 --> 01:13:15.200]   This was how it worked is that a rolling 30 days of your photos were available on all
[01:13:15.200 --> 01:13:21.080]   your devices so that you could see them or share them or copy them over, like copy them
[01:13:21.080 --> 01:13:24.120]   off your iPhone and put them on your Mac via photo stream.
[01:13:24.120 --> 01:13:25.320]   You could do it that way.
[01:13:25.320 --> 01:13:27.040]   But that's what it was.
[01:13:27.040 --> 01:13:31.480]   And one iCloud photo library came out and now that they've got library sharing on top
[01:13:31.480 --> 01:13:32.480]   of that.
[01:13:32.480 --> 01:13:35.240]   This is a cloud service whose time has passed.
[01:13:35.240 --> 01:13:40.280]   There's no functionality that you're losing by losing my photo stream.
[01:13:40.280 --> 01:13:45.680]   And Apple has already said that if you have any photos in that system, it's already on
[01:13:45.680 --> 01:13:47.440]   other devices and another Apple system.
[01:13:47.440 --> 01:13:51.880]   So it's not as though if it's something that you thought that, "Oh, wow, that came out
[01:13:51.880 --> 01:13:54.280]   roughly when my second daughter was born.
[01:13:54.280 --> 01:13:57.000]   Are there baby pictures that I haven't backed up yet?"
[01:13:57.000 --> 01:14:01.040]   If you did anything with them in photo stream, it's already an iPhoto and iCloud.
[01:14:01.040 --> 01:14:04.480]   That's actually really important because you don't want people to lose images.
[01:14:04.480 --> 01:14:07.600]   I have seen some people complain that, "Oh, it's going to use more bandwidth.
[01:14:07.600 --> 01:14:10.640]   I can't afford the bandwidth for iCloud."
[01:14:10.640 --> 01:14:12.440]   I don't know if that makes you make sense.
[01:14:12.440 --> 01:14:14.040]   I don't think it's going to use more bandwidth.
[01:14:14.040 --> 01:14:18.400]   But I guess maybe they didn't want to pay for iCloud because they don't have enough bandwidth
[01:14:18.400 --> 01:14:20.800]   to use it fully, something like that.
[01:14:20.800 --> 01:14:24.240]   If you don't pay for iCloud, what happens?
[01:14:24.240 --> 01:14:30.800]   Then you need to sync your photos by attaching it to your computer and syncing the photos
[01:14:30.800 --> 01:14:31.800]   that way.
[01:14:31.800 --> 01:14:33.760]   That's just how you have to do it if you don't want to use the cloud.
[01:14:33.760 --> 01:14:37.640]   Either a corded connection or you could just airdrop them or something like that.
[01:14:37.640 --> 01:14:42.800]   Get them onto the computer though before the shutdown in July.
[01:14:42.800 --> 01:14:49.760]   Apple's $50 million butterfly keyboard settlement has finally been approved.
[01:14:49.760 --> 01:14:53.320]   You know what was holding it up?
[01:14:53.320 --> 01:14:57.080]   So there was a class action lawsuit.
[01:14:57.080 --> 01:15:02.160]   86,000 people had repairs on their butterfly keyboard.
[01:15:02.160 --> 01:15:03.360]   So they're in the class.
[01:15:03.360 --> 01:15:06.160]   They're going to get some money.
[01:15:06.160 --> 01:15:12.640]   But there were a few people who said, "Well, this is only open to people who paid for repairs.
[01:15:12.640 --> 01:15:16.280]   I just want money for having to use that thing."
[01:15:16.280 --> 01:15:20.680]   I just give me money because I had to use the butterfly keyboard.
[01:15:20.680 --> 01:15:26.600]   The judge gave me one-twentyth of a cent for every typo I made because of that keyboard.
[01:15:26.600 --> 01:15:30.240]   Six objectors offered arguments saying the settlement wasn't fair to MacBook owners who
[01:15:30.240 --> 01:15:35.080]   never repaired their fair-held keyboards and therefore didn't get any cash or that
[01:15:35.080 --> 01:15:40.320]   the $125 offered to those who only had to pay for one replacement wasn't enough to cover
[01:15:40.320 --> 01:15:41.320]   the cost of repairs.
[01:15:41.320 --> 01:15:42.320]   Remember Joanna Stern?
[01:15:42.320 --> 01:15:46.240]   I think had to repair her butterfly keyboard multiple times.
[01:15:46.240 --> 01:15:50.920]   The judge said, "No, no, it's insufficient to say you just want more money."
[01:15:50.920 --> 01:15:56.240]   We all want more money.
[01:15:56.240 --> 01:15:58.800]   That doesn't really narrow it down enough.
[01:15:58.800 --> 01:16:04.600]   So the settlement's going to go out and the 86,000 people who filed their claims months
[01:16:04.600 --> 01:16:11.440]   ago last July dipped a little ladle into the cash flow for about a second.
[01:16:11.440 --> 01:16:12.440]   Oh, nothing.
[01:16:12.440 --> 01:16:14.440]   They just want...
[01:16:14.440 --> 01:16:15.440]   Okay, okay.
[01:16:15.440 --> 01:16:21.160]   You may get as much as $395 back to cover your repair costs, but you have to submit the proof
[01:16:21.160 --> 01:16:23.280]   of repair costs and all that stuff.
[01:16:23.280 --> 01:16:26.280]   Apple settlement does not include an admission of wrongdoing.
[01:16:26.280 --> 01:16:27.280]   What butterfly keyboard?
[01:16:27.280 --> 01:16:28.280]   There's no...
[01:16:28.280 --> 01:16:30.640]   What are you talking about?
[01:16:30.640 --> 01:16:31.640]   We love that butterfly keyboard.
[01:16:31.640 --> 01:16:36.360]   I thought you said in the keynote that customers love the new keyboard and you're just doing
[01:16:36.360 --> 01:16:40.240]   things to make them love it even more when you change the whole thing.
[01:16:40.240 --> 01:16:45.280]   This is a dopey story, but it's a story and we got to use all the ones we can get.
[01:16:45.280 --> 01:16:52.200]   Apple sued by actor Brent Sexton because they wanted him to get a COVID vaccine.
[01:16:52.200 --> 01:16:56.560]   He said, "I can't because I've got too many platelets."
[01:16:56.560 --> 01:17:01.960]   And as a result, they fired him from an upcoming Apple TV series called Manhunt.
[01:17:01.960 --> 01:17:04.920]   He was going to play president Andrew Johnson.
[01:17:04.920 --> 01:17:07.320]   It's just kind of appropriate that he didn't want to get a vaccine.
[01:17:07.320 --> 01:17:09.720]   I don't think Andrew Jackson or Johnson would have wanted.
[01:17:09.720 --> 01:17:11.200]   A propey's being a jerk, yeah.
[01:17:11.200 --> 01:17:12.200]   Yeah.
[01:17:12.200 --> 01:17:14.080]   He wouldn't have wanted it either.
[01:17:14.080 --> 01:17:20.060]   He had a note from a doctor, the actor's filing a disability discrimination lawsuit in Superior
[01:17:20.060 --> 01:17:24.600]   Court saying, "You can't fire me for not taking a vaccine that my doctor says I shouldn't
[01:17:24.600 --> 01:17:25.600]   get."
[01:17:25.600 --> 01:17:26.960]   You know, actually, he has too few platelets.
[01:17:26.960 --> 01:17:27.960]   Did I say too many?
[01:17:27.960 --> 01:17:28.960]   He has too few platelets.
[01:17:28.960 --> 01:17:31.560]   It's easy to confuse the two.
[01:17:31.560 --> 01:17:34.480]   Apple apparently still said, "You got to get the vaccine."
[01:17:34.480 --> 01:17:37.680]   I would think the production company is probably who's at fault.
[01:17:37.680 --> 01:17:39.360]   It's not Apple here, right?
[01:17:39.360 --> 01:17:42.480]   I mean, Apple's funding this.
[01:17:42.480 --> 01:17:46.560]   Now, Apple doesn't actually act as a production company for any of these, do they?
[01:17:46.560 --> 01:17:52.080]   Well, I mean, most of the production companies, though, had a mixture throughout COVID.
[01:17:52.080 --> 01:17:57.760]   There were a series of testing procedures and whether you were a Vaxx or not.
[01:17:57.760 --> 01:18:04.400]   It wasn't required except for when the production company or the owner of the production company
[01:18:04.400 --> 01:18:06.160]   decided that this is the way it needs to be.
[01:18:06.160 --> 01:18:07.400]   So it's the production company?
[01:18:07.400 --> 01:18:08.400]   No, it's production.
[01:18:08.400 --> 01:18:11.800]   In most productions, you were getting PCRs every day when you walked in.
[01:18:11.800 --> 01:18:12.800]   He said that.
[01:18:12.800 --> 01:18:17.200]   He said, "I'm willing to pay for testing and I will be testing every day."
[01:18:17.200 --> 01:18:18.200]   Well, that happened almost.
[01:18:18.200 --> 01:18:19.200]   You get tested every day.
[01:18:19.200 --> 01:18:26.320]   I mean, during the heaviest time, you would get tested every single day for PCR.
[01:18:26.320 --> 01:18:27.320]   And it was just walking.
[01:18:27.320 --> 01:18:29.520]   But they got to a point.
[01:18:29.520 --> 01:18:31.760]   At the first couple of productions, it was a little rough.
[01:18:31.760 --> 01:18:36.440]   Everyone was trying to figure out what was going on by a month or two into it.
[01:18:36.440 --> 01:18:39.840]   They had gotten it kind of sorted out.
[01:18:39.840 --> 01:18:41.720]   It was good money for the people who were doing it.
[01:18:41.720 --> 01:18:44.400]   I think the PCR is like 175 a piece or something like that.
[01:18:44.400 --> 01:18:46.080]   So that's what they were charging.
[01:18:46.080 --> 01:18:47.080]   It was cost in Malala.
[01:18:47.080 --> 01:18:49.200]   So it was good business while it lasted.
[01:18:49.200 --> 01:18:52.680]   I have one of my former employees was the COVID officer.
[01:18:52.680 --> 01:18:55.000]   So she was busy doing this.
[01:18:55.000 --> 01:19:00.640]   And having had three PCRs in my life, I hope I never have to do that.
[01:19:00.640 --> 01:19:01.640]   The reproduction.
[01:19:01.640 --> 01:19:06.560]   I mean, the very first one, I was like, "Oh my gosh, I can't believe I'm doing this."
[01:19:06.560 --> 01:19:09.680]   And by the month into it of doing these production.
[01:19:09.680 --> 01:19:12.080]   Does it stop making your eyes water?
[01:19:12.080 --> 01:19:13.920]   No, you just lean up.
[01:19:13.920 --> 01:19:16.600]   You just go like this, lean your head up and you lean your head back down.
[01:19:16.600 --> 01:19:19.960]   You're like, "Yeah, you just sit down and just go lean your head up and do it."
[01:19:19.960 --> 01:19:20.960]   You get used to it.
[01:19:20.960 --> 01:19:21.960]   And so...
[01:19:21.960 --> 01:19:22.960]   But it didn't really matter.
[01:19:22.960 --> 01:19:25.760]   I mean, I don't think they were really worried about...
[01:19:25.760 --> 01:19:27.520]   They were worried about people getting COVID.
[01:19:27.520 --> 01:19:28.520]   They just...
[01:19:28.520 --> 01:19:30.240]   They wanted to make sure that no one was on set with COVID.
[01:19:30.240 --> 01:19:32.160]   And the PCR is the most sensitive.
[01:19:32.160 --> 01:19:36.400]   And then, you know, by within six months, we were mostly doing antigen.
[01:19:36.400 --> 01:19:37.400]   Like it was like antigen.
[01:19:37.400 --> 01:19:42.520]   And if you test positive on antigen, you'll get PCR test, but the antigen was a lot cheaper.
[01:19:42.520 --> 01:19:43.520]   And you know, that kind of...
[01:19:43.520 --> 01:19:44.520]   It actually turns out that...
[01:19:44.520 --> 01:19:47.440]   No one cared after that.
[01:19:47.440 --> 01:19:52.280]   The writer's strike is going to do a lot more harm to production than COVID did, I think.
[01:19:52.280 --> 01:19:54.280]   We what?
[01:19:54.280 --> 01:19:55.280]   How many months in...
[01:19:55.280 --> 01:19:56.280]   Pretty messy.
[01:19:56.280 --> 01:19:57.280]   How long is it going to last?
[01:19:57.280 --> 01:19:58.280]   It's...
[01:19:58.280 --> 01:19:59.280]   There doesn't seem to be much movement.
[01:19:59.280 --> 01:20:04.000]   It's probably going to last forever because they want things that are not possible.
[01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:06.640]   So like, you know, until they decide that they're going to knock on, they're not going to do
[01:20:06.640 --> 01:20:07.640]   the things that they're doing.
[01:20:07.640 --> 01:20:08.640]   They're not...
[01:20:08.640 --> 01:20:09.640]   The writers are the producers.
[01:20:09.640 --> 01:20:10.640]   The writers are not.
[01:20:10.640 --> 01:20:11.640]   The writers can't.
[01:20:11.640 --> 01:20:12.640]   They're not.
[01:20:12.640 --> 01:20:13.640]   The producers aren't going to keep on that.
[01:20:13.640 --> 01:20:16.720]   Alex, you're wearing your producer hat right now.
[01:20:16.720 --> 01:20:17.720]   I'm just saying...
[01:20:17.720 --> 01:20:18.720]   I'm not wearing any hat.
[01:20:18.720 --> 01:20:19.720]   I'm just saying I'm just being real.
[01:20:19.720 --> 01:20:20.720]   Like, you know, like...
[01:20:20.720 --> 01:20:25.520]   The producers aren't going to give what they're asking because that would be suicide.
[01:20:25.520 --> 01:20:27.840]   And so the thing is, is that the writers...
[01:20:27.840 --> 01:20:29.800]   You know, I'm not disagreeing with the writers.
[01:20:29.800 --> 01:20:33.480]   I think that they should keep on fighting the good fight.
[01:20:33.480 --> 01:20:34.480]   I just don't think...
[01:20:34.480 --> 01:20:35.480]   I'll be super surprised if they...
[01:20:35.480 --> 01:20:37.480]   I'm never going to get something out of it that you think...
[01:20:37.480 --> 01:20:38.480]   That's what negotiation is.
[01:20:38.480 --> 01:20:39.480]   That's what negotiation is.
[01:20:39.480 --> 01:20:42.480]   Starting a position and then you have something willing to give.
[01:20:42.480 --> 01:20:43.480]   It's a pretty nice...
[01:20:43.480 --> 01:20:47.680]   My sense of it is that there's a few things like AI and stuff, but really the real concern
[01:20:47.680 --> 01:20:54.080]   is the writers agreement, which creates streaming, doesn't include sufficient compensation for
[01:20:54.080 --> 01:20:55.080]   streaming.
[01:20:55.080 --> 01:20:56.080]   Is that right?
[01:20:56.080 --> 01:20:59.840]   I just don't know if you're ever going to be able to calculate...
[01:20:59.840 --> 01:21:03.400]   I guess the thing that I don't understand is how they're ever going to be able to calculate
[01:21:03.400 --> 01:21:05.440]   royalties the way they did before.
[01:21:05.440 --> 01:21:08.400]   Because people only watch little bits and pieces and it's all connected to a larger
[01:21:08.400 --> 01:21:09.400]   thing and it's really...
[01:21:09.400 --> 01:21:11.560]   Well, and also streamers are losing money like crazy.
[01:21:11.560 --> 01:21:12.560]   It's not like...
[01:21:12.560 --> 01:21:13.560]   Or are they?
[01:21:13.560 --> 01:21:17.680]   It's funny because they're firing people and they're canceling shows and yet they seem
[01:21:17.680 --> 01:21:18.920]   to be making profits.
[01:21:18.920 --> 01:21:19.920]   So I'm very confused.
[01:21:19.920 --> 01:21:24.440]   I'm not losing money, but I'm just saying that the problem is that the person isn't
[01:21:24.440 --> 01:21:25.440]   buying...
[01:21:25.440 --> 01:21:27.400]   They're no longer going to that show.
[01:21:27.400 --> 01:21:29.800]   Like they're no longer going to that thing.
[01:21:29.800 --> 01:21:30.800]   You mean that network?
[01:21:30.800 --> 01:21:31.800]   That's streamer.
[01:21:31.800 --> 01:21:32.800]   They're not saying...
[01:21:32.800 --> 01:21:33.800]   They're going to that...
[01:21:33.800 --> 01:21:34.800]   They're going...
[01:21:34.800 --> 01:21:37.840]   They're watching X number of minutes of this and I guess you could try to figure that
[01:21:37.840 --> 01:21:38.840]   out.
[01:21:38.840 --> 01:21:40.320]   That'll unwrap into such a mess.
[01:21:40.320 --> 01:21:42.160]   I'm certain they could try to figure...
[01:21:42.160 --> 01:21:43.600]   I mean, Netflix knows.
[01:21:43.600 --> 01:21:47.720]   The streamers have data about all of that and I bet you they could do it.
[01:21:47.720 --> 01:21:49.280]   And maybe that's the path forward here.
[01:21:49.280 --> 01:21:54.760]   But the bottom line is, as Andy said, all the writer deals were basically made on a
[01:21:54.760 --> 01:22:00.760]   scenario where you had reruns on TV and stuff like that and that the value was spread over
[01:22:00.760 --> 01:22:01.760]   time.
[01:22:01.760 --> 01:22:06.600]   And now a lot of times the value is only concentrated on the streamer and there's very little...
[01:22:06.600 --> 01:22:08.120]   Here's the thing that people don't know.
[01:22:08.120 --> 01:22:13.040]   There's very little disclosure of data, of proprietary streaming data to people on the
[01:22:13.040 --> 01:22:18.200]   creative side from people on the production side or the streamer side.
[01:22:18.200 --> 01:22:21.520]   And this is part of the issue is they can't...
[01:22:21.520 --> 01:22:26.080]   Creative professionals in Hollywood don't even have a way to judge their worth because
[01:22:26.080 --> 01:22:27.080]   the stats...
[01:22:27.080 --> 01:22:33.320]   So when you're trying to negotiate your next deal, you don't have your deal detailing
[01:22:33.320 --> 01:22:37.440]   whether you were a hit at Netflix because Netflix doesn't tell you except the barest
[01:22:37.440 --> 01:22:39.440]   limited amount that Netflix wants to tell you.
[01:22:39.440 --> 01:22:41.720]   So that is the nut they're trying to crack.
[01:22:41.720 --> 01:22:42.720]   And I agree.
[01:22:42.720 --> 01:22:46.080]   I think a lot of this stuff is going to fall by the wayside for them to just try to come
[01:22:46.080 --> 01:22:51.840]   up with a framework that means that if you're writing for a TV show on Netflix and it does
[01:22:51.840 --> 01:22:55.560]   three seasons and then it's on Netflix for another 10 years or whatever it is that you
[01:22:55.560 --> 01:23:00.920]   get compensated in a way that you used to, it's not the same but in a way that makes
[01:23:00.920 --> 01:23:07.920]   sense like the old rerun system made sense because that system is basically dead.
[01:23:07.920 --> 01:23:10.000]   There are a whole bunch of things going on.
[01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:15.160]   But one of them is that it's not so much that they want more money but their position
[01:23:15.160 --> 01:23:19.400]   or at least their negotiating position is that a lot of the deals that the union agreed
[01:23:19.400 --> 01:23:23.280]   to are based on the fact that, okay, we're going to accept less money upfront because
[01:23:23.280 --> 01:23:27.160]   we're going to be making, you're going to be giving us a lot more money in the future,
[01:23:27.160 --> 01:23:28.160]   not anticipating that.
[01:23:28.160 --> 01:23:33.440]   And in addition to everything that Jason said that what you've written is exclusive
[01:23:33.440 --> 01:23:35.240]   to Netflix or Disney.
[01:23:35.240 --> 01:23:36.680]   They ran it for one season.
[01:23:36.680 --> 01:23:37.880]   Their things are kind of tight.
[01:23:37.880 --> 01:23:42.000]   So they they're not only not picking up for a second season but they're also dropping it
[01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:43.400]   off the channel.
[01:23:43.400 --> 01:23:47.400]   There's no place you can buy it on physical media, no place you can buy it on iTunes
[01:23:47.400 --> 01:23:48.480]   or whatever.
[01:23:48.480 --> 01:23:51.600]   And so now that's just simply an absolute dead source of revenue.
[01:23:51.600 --> 01:23:56.320]   They're also they're also arguing about what I found out called the mini mini rooms, mini
[01:23:56.320 --> 01:24:00.960]   writers rooms where instead of having a team of people who are hired for an entire development
[01:24:00.960 --> 01:24:05.760]   cycle to develop the entire show the entire the Bible and the entire first season, it's
[01:24:05.760 --> 01:24:09.840]   like you basically get a few people in for guess what you get to you get an entire weekend
[01:24:09.840 --> 01:24:14.560]   to break all of the stories for this entire thing with a minimal number of people.
[01:24:14.560 --> 01:24:17.360]   And so we're a very tiny amount of money and no security.
[01:24:17.360 --> 01:24:23.760]   So basically they're they're trying to turn this into a more of a gig economy than a like
[01:24:23.760 --> 01:24:30.320]   treating writers like professionals whose work is is worth being able to own a whole
[01:24:30.320 --> 01:24:33.080]   to basically to live and eat and that sort of stuff.
[01:24:33.080 --> 01:24:36.360]   And of course, and of course everyone below the line is like welcome to our world.
[01:24:36.360 --> 01:24:37.360]   Right.
[01:24:37.360 --> 01:24:39.800]   Like like like literally like the thing is that the first group.
[01:24:39.800 --> 01:24:43.040]   I said the last 25 years under below the line.
[01:24:43.040 --> 01:24:47.200]   And so the thing is is that what the writers are fighting for is what we don't ever you
[01:24:47.200 --> 01:24:50.960]   know, we get we accept less knowing that we're not going to get anything in the future.
[01:24:50.960 --> 01:24:54.400]   And there's no residuals for for residuals.
[01:24:54.400 --> 01:24:56.640]   I mean, I work on Star Wars for three years.
[01:24:56.640 --> 01:24:57.680]   I haven't seen it check.
[01:24:57.680 --> 01:24:58.680]   Right.
[01:24:58.680 --> 01:25:02.640]   So so anyway, so so I think that writers are pretty darn important though.
[01:25:02.640 --> 01:25:07.120]   I mean, not the lighting gaffers aren't but hey, I the queen ship was pretty important.
[01:25:07.120 --> 01:25:08.120]   Okay, you're right.
[01:25:08.120 --> 01:25:09.120]   You're right.
[01:25:09.120 --> 01:25:14.280]   I mean, there's no I should know one craft is more important than the other.
[01:25:14.280 --> 01:25:17.640]   I guess actors, of course, get the lion's share of revenue.
[01:25:17.640 --> 01:25:20.880]   You get you know, I think anyone should get whatever whatever they can whatever they
[01:25:20.880 --> 01:25:21.880]   can have.
[01:25:21.880 --> 01:25:24.560]   They should get what they get if we had if we were able to do that, we would do it.
[01:25:24.560 --> 01:25:27.520]   I can tell you who doesn't deserve the money they're getting.
[01:25:27.520 --> 01:25:31.720]   It's the executives, you know, and I think that's fair to say we want a little more of
[01:25:31.720 --> 01:25:34.440]   that trickle down here.
[01:25:34.440 --> 01:25:36.440]   We're making we're writing this stuff.
[01:25:36.440 --> 01:25:42.000]   We're happy we're happy to learn that Matt Granegg like is a half a billionaire at this
[01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:44.040]   point because he created this.
[01:25:44.040 --> 01:25:45.040]   He did it.
[01:25:45.040 --> 01:25:47.680]   Absolute fire hose of money for Fox.
[01:25:47.680 --> 01:25:51.760]   And so therefore he should also be have a half a billion dollars for having done this
[01:25:51.760 --> 01:25:57.040]   and the sort of deal that Fox made with him at the at the outset would never they basically
[01:25:57.040 --> 01:25:58.880]   he'd have like maybe I don't know.
[01:25:58.880 --> 01:25:59.880]   Okay.
[01:25:59.880 --> 01:26:00.880]   I'm not going to claim to have knowledge.
[01:26:00.880 --> 01:26:05.200]   I don't have but you could absolutely make sure that when the producers get together,
[01:26:05.200 --> 01:26:10.200]   they point at that and say we must never let that happen again where a a creator of
[01:26:10.200 --> 01:26:15.440]   all people gets to become a wealthy people and gets to join my my country club.
[01:26:15.440 --> 01:26:17.880]   What are we as as consumers of this stuff?
[01:26:17.880 --> 01:26:21.600]   Yeah, we get kind of half ass poorly written stuff.
[01:26:21.600 --> 01:26:23.720]   We get another season of amazing race.
[01:26:23.720 --> 01:26:24.720]   A lot of that.
[01:26:24.720 --> 01:26:28.880]   Yeah, you get reality stuff and podcasts lots of podcasts.
[01:26:28.880 --> 01:26:32.480]   Oh, no, that's the don't do that.
[01:26:32.480 --> 01:26:36.280]   Yeah, it's low the line.
[01:26:36.280 --> 01:26:38.480]   It's actually it's probably actually pretty good podcasts.
[01:26:38.480 --> 01:26:39.480]   Good for youtubers.
[01:26:39.480 --> 01:26:40.480]   It's good for creators.
[01:26:40.480 --> 01:26:41.480]   Yeah.
[01:26:41.480 --> 01:26:45.640]   You know, because if if it really runs dry, the behaviors will start to change again.
[01:26:45.640 --> 01:26:48.040]   And so that's what that's what we've seen in the past.
[01:26:48.040 --> 01:26:51.880]   So it just depends on how long the last one was a huge boom for reality TV.
[01:26:51.880 --> 01:26:53.840]   It wasn't that it started reality TV.
[01:26:53.840 --> 01:26:58.920]   Reality TV was a nation market that that was that was the thing that they could could
[01:26:58.920 --> 01:26:59.920]   jump to.
[01:26:59.920 --> 01:27:02.520]   Like over a big chunk of stuff.
[01:27:02.520 --> 01:27:07.720]   The benefactors of this right now are overseas productions, creators.
[01:27:07.720 --> 01:27:11.200]   You know, those types of things are all things that are going to benefit from from a very
[01:27:11.200 --> 01:27:12.200]   long strike.
[01:27:12.200 --> 01:27:15.360]   It'd be a good time to start your TikTok channel is what you're saying.
[01:27:15.360 --> 01:27:16.360]   Yeah.
[01:27:16.360 --> 01:27:17.360]   Get going.
[01:27:17.360 --> 01:27:18.360]   Get going.
[01:27:18.360 --> 01:27:23.680]   Actually, I was interested, you know, Vice, which just recently declared chapter 11, one
[01:27:23.680 --> 01:27:27.280]   of the things that was the nail in the coffin for Vice was the decision to do a lot of
[01:27:27.280 --> 01:27:28.280]   TV production.
[01:27:28.280 --> 01:27:34.680]   So it's very interesting to see that the verge is now starting a YouTube TV documentary
[01:27:34.680 --> 01:27:35.680]   production.
[01:27:35.680 --> 01:27:40.880]   I think the hard part is TV production and on and YouTube production are very different.
[01:27:40.880 --> 01:27:43.560]   And I think that that's the they're very different from a cost perspective.
[01:27:43.560 --> 01:27:48.320]   TV is really expensive to produce for compared to this is cheap.
[01:27:48.320 --> 01:27:49.320]   Yeah.
[01:27:49.320 --> 01:27:50.320]   No, it's cheaper.
[01:27:50.320 --> 01:27:56.320]   I wouldn't say that's cheap, but you're not like relatively nice to be on a mailing list
[01:27:56.320 --> 01:27:59.600]   that would send you the pitches from all the production companies.
[01:27:59.600 --> 01:28:03.680]   And so you would say, Hey, we're looking for a new series for Epic.
[01:28:03.680 --> 01:28:06.000]   And it's got 375,000 an episode.
[01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:10.480]   And this is what and that was like a low budget one, 375,000 all in.
[01:28:10.480 --> 01:28:11.480]   It's this.
[01:28:11.480 --> 01:28:12.840]   It shouldn't have this kind of people.
[01:28:12.840 --> 01:28:14.160]   It should have these kind of people.
[01:28:14.160 --> 01:28:15.640]   This is the kind of thing we want.
[01:28:15.640 --> 01:28:19.480]   And you would get what you get like two or three of those a day.
[01:28:19.480 --> 01:28:22.880]   And then you got the real sense of how much all these all those shows you watch on TV
[01:28:22.880 --> 01:28:24.960]   are somewhere quarter million or north.
[01:28:24.960 --> 01:28:26.760]   So here's the verges.
[01:28:26.760 --> 01:28:31.400]   I think first documentary, Apple's secret burial.
[01:28:31.400 --> 01:28:34.200]   I got all excited when I thought it was a documentary about Lisa.
[01:28:34.200 --> 01:28:35.200]   It's not.
[01:28:35.200 --> 01:28:39.920]   It's a documentary about what happened after Lisa was canceled.
[01:28:39.920 --> 01:28:45.200]   It's subtitle Lisa, Steve Jobs sabotage and Apples secret burial.
[01:28:45.200 --> 01:28:48.240]   It's a half hour documentary.
[01:28:48.240 --> 01:28:52.040]   It's, it's, I think it's, I didn't watch the whole thing, but it's well produced.
[01:28:52.040 --> 01:28:57.120]   That's definitely a YouTube style production, right?
[01:28:57.120 --> 01:29:02.600]   You know, no actors, of course, some interviews for sure.
[01:29:02.600 --> 01:29:05.600]   Look at that Geneva typeface.
[01:29:05.600 --> 01:29:08.480]   That's, that's history right there.
[01:29:08.480 --> 01:29:12.160]   And then they are, and by the way, just if you're one of those people sending pitches
[01:29:12.160 --> 01:29:15.040]   to Alex, you might want to note this in the comments.
[01:29:15.040 --> 01:29:18.880]   The Verge says, what other mysteries or forgotten stories should we look into?
[01:29:18.880 --> 01:29:22.920]   So they, they apparently aren't getting that same mail that you are, Alex.
[01:29:22.920 --> 01:29:26.680]   Well, no, but this is a much different, again, it's much different budget.
[01:29:26.680 --> 01:29:28.160]   I think that I'll be honest.
[01:29:28.160 --> 01:29:32.200]   I think that a lot of YouTuber stuff is, is now reaching a point where I consider it's
[01:29:32.200 --> 01:29:33.200]   very good.
[01:29:33.200 --> 01:29:34.200]   Yeah.
[01:29:34.200 --> 01:29:35.200]   A huge chunk of what I watch is YouTube.
[01:29:35.200 --> 01:29:37.760]   And at this point, if you look at it, you're not going to see a succession.
[01:29:37.760 --> 01:29:40.720]   You're not going to see a succession on YouTube.
[01:29:40.720 --> 01:29:41.720]   You're not going to.
[01:29:41.720 --> 01:29:42.720]   It's different kind of.
[01:29:42.720 --> 01:29:43.720]   No, because that's what it is.
[01:29:43.720 --> 01:29:44.720]   It's different.
[01:29:44.720 --> 01:29:45.720]   It's $100,000 a minute.
[01:29:45.720 --> 01:29:48.400]   Yeah, but those are the things writers write.
[01:29:48.400 --> 01:29:50.880]   You know what I'm saying?
[01:29:50.880 --> 01:29:53.080]   That's where you have great writers and great actors.
[01:29:53.080 --> 01:29:56.360]   Is that, is that dead?
[01:29:56.360 --> 01:29:59.080]   I think that there'll be less of it as we move forward.
[01:29:59.080 --> 01:30:02.720]   I mean, I think that that's there's probably more Marvel on the one end.
[01:30:02.720 --> 01:30:04.200]   There'll be more MCU.
[01:30:04.200 --> 01:30:07.000]   I don't know if I don't think there will be.
[01:30:07.000 --> 01:30:08.000]   Not even that.
[01:30:08.000 --> 01:30:11.280]   There's a lot of concern that that's not viable anymore.
[01:30:11.280 --> 01:30:14.960]   Like it's not, it's viable right now, but there's a concern that 10 years from now,
[01:30:14.960 --> 01:30:18.360]   no one's watching MCU because or not no one, but they're not going to see it.
[01:30:18.360 --> 01:30:20.960]   They saw it five years ago.
[01:30:20.960 --> 01:30:21.960]   Five years ago.
[01:30:21.960 --> 01:30:22.960]   It's expensive to make.
[01:30:22.960 --> 01:30:23.960]   So, yeah.
[01:30:23.960 --> 01:30:24.960]   Interesting.
[01:30:24.960 --> 01:30:30.640]   So, and the stuff in the middle, the prestige like HBO is no longer, right?
[01:30:30.640 --> 01:30:31.720]   It's Max.
[01:30:31.720 --> 01:30:35.720]   So the prestige productions, those probably.
[01:30:35.720 --> 01:30:41.160]   HBO still exists not only on TV, but as a part of it's like Max.
[01:30:41.160 --> 01:30:46.040]   It's one of the things and they have a budget and Casey Bloy is the still, who's the head
[01:30:46.040 --> 01:30:48.960]   of HBO is still generating that high prestige content.
[01:30:48.960 --> 01:30:53.240]   And it's not, it's not going anywhere, but I think Alex is right that John Landgraaff,
[01:30:53.240 --> 01:30:57.080]   who's been the head of FX for the last few years, he's considered kind of the mayor of
[01:30:57.080 --> 01:30:58.080]   television.
[01:30:58.080 --> 01:31:01.440]   He's been charting peak TV and we've reached it, right?
[01:31:01.440 --> 01:31:06.760]   Like clearly, we have reached the most television that's ever going to be produced in a year
[01:31:06.760 --> 01:31:09.400]   as original scripted content in American TV.
[01:31:09.400 --> 01:31:10.400]   It's over, right?
[01:31:10.400 --> 01:31:11.400]   It's coming down the other side.
[01:31:11.400 --> 01:31:13.760]   I don't think it's going to go away, but yeah, we're not.
[01:31:13.760 --> 01:31:16.840]   We're in a contraction era now, not an inflation era.
[01:31:16.840 --> 01:31:19.320]   Yeah, you're going to see, you're still going to see Superman.
[01:31:19.320 --> 01:31:21.880]   You're still going to see, you know, I, you know, not, not.
[01:31:21.880 --> 01:31:23.360]   And HBO stuff too.
[01:31:23.360 --> 01:31:24.360]   And HBO stuff.
[01:31:24.360 --> 01:31:27.760]   Sometimes it's not going to go away and like radio never went away.
[01:31:27.760 --> 01:31:32.240]   You know, we still, there's still radios out there, but, but I think that the hard part
[01:31:32.240 --> 01:31:39.200]   is is that you, if I look at the behavior of my kids, you know, they're, they're watching
[01:31:39.200 --> 01:31:40.200]   deep library.
[01:31:40.200 --> 01:31:45.200]   I mean, they're watching stuff that hasn't, that's 10 years old, 20 years old, and they're
[01:31:45.200 --> 01:31:48.280]   watching YouTube and they're playing games and creating their own stuff.
[01:31:48.280 --> 01:31:52.200]   And I just don't see, and they're friends when they come over, it's all the same.
[01:31:52.200 --> 01:31:56.680]   Like you just see this, like they're watching old Japanese animations and they're watching
[01:31:56.680 --> 01:32:01.120]   old films, like my daughter's watching Gilmore Girls, you know, and so, so they're, you know,
[01:32:01.120 --> 01:32:05.120]   they're all watching these old, old films in these old shows and very little interest
[01:32:05.120 --> 01:32:06.120]   in the newer ones.
[01:32:06.120 --> 01:32:09.200]   Like we, we occasionally get into the newer ones, but it's not.
[01:32:09.200 --> 01:32:11.200]   And I think that's the, that's a real challenge.
[01:32:11.200 --> 01:32:14.000]   Hope the writers of Gilmore Girls are getting paid for that, by the way.
[01:32:14.000 --> 01:32:15.000]   That's right.
[01:32:15.000 --> 01:32:16.800]   What are the residuals for that?
[01:32:16.800 --> 01:32:20.320]   Cause that's the kind of stuff that Amy Sherman, Paladina should be getting a lot of money
[01:32:20.320 --> 01:32:23.200]   for that for your, your daughter watching Gilmore Girls.
[01:32:23.200 --> 01:32:24.200]   Absolutely.
[01:32:24.200 --> 01:32:25.200]   Exactly.
[01:32:25.200 --> 01:32:26.200]   Where does she watch it?
[01:32:26.200 --> 01:32:28.200]   I guess depends if she's watching a stream and then they're not.
[01:32:28.200 --> 01:32:29.200]   She watches it on Netflix.
[01:32:29.200 --> 01:32:30.200]   Netflix.
[01:32:30.200 --> 01:32:31.200]   So they're, so I don't know if I'm getting, so it's something.
[01:32:31.200 --> 01:32:32.200]   No, I think they are.
[01:32:32.200 --> 01:32:35.200]   I think they're made a deal at some point.
[01:32:35.200 --> 01:32:37.200]   But it's probably a really bad rate.
[01:32:37.200 --> 01:32:38.200]   Right.
[01:32:38.200 --> 01:32:40.120]   But it's, yeah, she watches it on, I think on Netflix.
[01:32:40.120 --> 01:32:44.200]   So it's, it's, I think that it's going to be, but I do think that there's the, the interest
[01:32:44.200 --> 01:32:47.520]   in narrative is, is, you know, it's just hard to write.
[01:32:47.520 --> 01:32:48.520]   Here's what it takes.
[01:32:48.520 --> 01:32:52.120]   There's a lot of great writers that are way better than anything that I would ever do.
[01:32:52.120 --> 01:32:54.960]   It's just hard to write good stuff on a consistent basis.
[01:32:54.960 --> 01:32:56.880]   And I think that it's expensive.
[01:32:56.880 --> 01:33:01.480]   Well, it's expensive and it's also just really hard to come up with a story.
[01:33:01.480 --> 01:33:05.320]   And, you know, and I think that somebody like Jesse Armstrong is expensive, I would
[01:33:05.320 --> 01:33:06.320]   imagine.
[01:33:06.320 --> 01:33:07.320]   Yeah.
[01:33:07.320 --> 01:33:08.320]   And I think that's a great way to do it.
[01:33:08.320 --> 01:33:09.320]   And I think that's a great way to do it.
[01:33:09.320 --> 01:33:10.320]   And I think that's a great way to do it.
[01:33:10.320 --> 01:33:11.320]   And I think that's a great way to do it.
