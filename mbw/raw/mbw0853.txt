[00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:38.200]   Hello Leo, it's good to be here and isn't it nice that Apple did something for us so that we can
[00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:41.900]   Elon Musk yeah a little while and talk about
[00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:47.720]   Max they gave us something to say hmm Andy and I go WJ
[00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:49.540]   Bert
[00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:50.840]   Hello Andrew
[00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:52.760]   Hey there. Hi there. I'm just one as well
[00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:58.120]   Let's you know and everyone watch on YouTube that I'm now in week number two of not being able to find my 4k
[00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:04.840]   Logitech Brio camera after T after after doing one show in a conference room at the library. I think you left it in the library
[00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:08.640]   I can't you know what I'm I'm gonna go and check
[00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:15.200]   But the thing is I am so paranoid about this is not that I don't think I'm the sort of person who would google leave such a thing behind
[00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:19.680]   I'm so paranoid about being such a person that I always stop turn around
[00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:27.120]   Examine the room carefully, but now I'm like I'm going to okay, you know what I was out of Wendy's like two weeks ago
[00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:31.720]   I didn't have didn't have my backpack with me, but maybe it was in my jacket pocket
[00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:34.160]   I took my jacket off and felt that I I
[00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:37.160]   Might be the market for and for a new camera. That's what I'm saying
[00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:45.160]   Oh, I'm back so I'm back to my backup Logitech 720c and we will gladly send you at no cost
[00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:47.800]   To you at no charge and no obligation
[00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:54.360]   You're very own. Well, Kessen you whatever camera you want or whatever camera if you wanted to throw to us
[00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:56.960]   We like I think Alex Lindsey probably a recommendation
[00:03:56.960 --> 00:04:00.160]   Whatever Alex recommends
[00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:09.000]   So I get to you. What should we get him an area left? Oh, yeah, no not gonna do that. No my friend. Yeah
[00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:16.920]   So I'm with an with an with an engine who lens. I think I think okay. Yeah. Yeah, so yeah
[00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:21.920]   Yeah, I think that right now our reigning champion is the Insta360 link. Oh, yeah
[00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:26.080]   That's pretty cool and it follows the Miranda stuff, which is good for people who go to the library a lot
[00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:32.960]   Yeah, exactly that is Alex Lindsey of office hours. Global and as you can tell he is our multimedia guru and
[00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:38.280]   He has now added Christmas lights to his display. I started playing with them
[00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:42.580]   I was like, you know, I really like I you know the hard part with office hours
[00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:44.700]   You're always trying to keep up with the Jones's even so everybody
[00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:47.640]   Some lights up there and I was like I really like the lights
[00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:48.960]   But I can't figure out what to do with them yet
[00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:54.880]   So I I had just taken apart the Christmas tree and I had the string of lights that I'd gotten there like USB controlled and
[00:04:54.880 --> 00:05:00.920]   I was like man. Oh, that's those thing. I'm jiggers. What do they call those? You can yeah, you can control them
[00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:05.960]   John has those around his house and he does things like the Twit logo and
[00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:12.320]   I haven't done anything special with them yet. Everybody's getting mad at us because we're sitting on the big story
[00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:19.960]   Yeah, so weirdly yesterday mark german unexplained unexpectedly said oh, yeah, there's gonna be new max tomorrow
[00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:23.520]   Just like yeah
[00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:29.040]   I mean I'm a breaker after Mac break. That's all we want to know not to tell tales out of school
[00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:33.000]   But you know when you when you know they're coming you want it to be a surprise
[00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:37.240]   I we got all the way to yesterday and I'm like oh come on
[00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:39.320]   Come on yeah
[00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:45.680]   Because because we're all children and we all and apple treats us like children a Christmas morning when actually we'd much rather be able to sort of
[00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:52.280]   Plan ahead before like we commit our department to making lots of purchases. We're going to have to regret later on I mean say whatever
[00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:59.280]   When you're under embargo, it's really nice. Oh you knew oh you knew so he broke his embargo
[00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:02.720]   Do you think that's what he did no? Oh no, I he talked to somebody
[00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:07.240]   I saw a couple reports Mac rumors. I think had a report too, and I'm like alright. Well somebody talked
[00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:13.040]   Like mark german says to Mac rumors, I'll tell you
[00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:20.640]   What I know if you tell me what you know, but don't quote me and even though they're both breaking embargo
[00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:27.080]   They're not breaking their own embargo in their own book. Well, but Apple hasn't Apple doesn't tell this to Mac rumors or mark german, right?
[00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:30.800]   Somebody else who's who they told you yeah? I
[00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:35.160]   Knew something was coming out. You know what although based on all of mark german's reports
[00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:41.120]   It was pretty obvious what it was gonna be right so so what tell me just at it because I I'm of course not in this gravy
[00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:44.800]   Train pipeline of journalists what how did it occurred?
[00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:50.160]   Does somebody call you do you get me? I just got it? I got a I got a heads up that there's news dropping
[00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:57.160]   Yeah, and that was it and literally like a guy in the direction of the trip to not even not even time
[00:06:57.160 --> 00:07:00.240]   Right, so it's like set your alarm for 6 a.m. Cuz it's always at 6 a.m.
[00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:07.320]   And it'll probably be those things because of all the reporting from Bloomberg and mark german, but all you were told is sometime
[00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:14.780]   Tomorrow Tuesday. Yeah, yeah was my Monday Monday so yesterday so yesterday. So Tuesday. Sorry Tuesday. Yes today
[00:07:14.780 --> 00:07:19.240]   What day is it today? Yes today's today's so they tell you yes, yes, I yeah
[00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:25.520]   So so yeah, so I you know it's just one of those things that the best moment one of the most fun
[00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:30.360]   And I get Andy's point like it is a PR time thing and if people can report it they should report it
[00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:36.680]   But I had a delightful moment many years ago when mountain lion came out where we got a bunch of media
[00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:40.000]   We're summoned individually to briefings not knowing what it was about and
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:44.700]   I was in there an mg-siggler who was at the time a tech crunch was in there
[00:07:44.700 --> 00:07:48.440]   Good old and we got our briefings from mountain lion and I don't know if you remember
[00:07:48.440 --> 00:07:53.000]   But there were literally no reports that there was gonna be a new Mac OS update none zero
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:56.080]   And then you walk into the room and they're like we have a new Mac OS update
[00:07:56.080 --> 00:08:00.840]   You're like what and then I walk out mg is there because he's been on the phone or something
[00:08:00.840 --> 00:08:06.920]   And we're walking to our cars and we look at each other like were you totally surprised by that and it was like yes
[00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:11.080]   And it was it was kind of fun because it was it not that
[00:08:11.080 --> 00:08:14.840]   You know the people who do work like mark german to get the stuff up in advance
[00:08:14.840 --> 00:08:19.160]   I'm not really a believer in that it spoilers and that it it ruins the fun
[00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:24.040]   but it is fun every now and then for a legitimate surprise to happen and
[00:08:24.040 --> 00:08:28.440]   Apple scrutiny is so great at this point that it basically never happens
[00:08:28.440 --> 00:08:35.120]   Well given what we said last week and my upset over it that apple wasn't gonna do much this year and
[00:08:35.120 --> 00:08:42.880]   Don't get excited for new max because we're gonna they've taken people off the Mac team and putting them on the VR team and blah blah blah
[00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:48.400]   I was I had geared myself up for well just sadness through at least June
[00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:50.320]   and
[00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:56.440]   And we even there was no mention remember last remember last week do you remember last week when we thought there
[00:08:56.440 --> 00:08:58.440]   Wasn't even gonna be a new Mac mini this year
[00:08:58.440 --> 00:09:03.840]   We knew that be those well they'll do oh I didn't you didn't think you never for a month
[00:09:03.840 --> 00:09:10.800]   I thought the Mac the Mac mini was obvious because it was the it was the only member of the product line that was still in the
[00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:15.200]   Hey, here's the really really first swing proof of concept
[00:09:15.760 --> 00:09:21.760]   Apple Silicon in there it needed to receive new Apple Silicon literally one week ago. There were stories saying
[00:09:21.760 --> 00:09:25.600]   MacBook Pro refresh delayed again. Yeah
[00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:32.040]   German himself said well all we're gonna release he's a 15 inch m2 Mac book air
[00:09:32.040 --> 00:09:39.480]   Well, that's that's what your german said that these products were coming and in fact he reported last November that they had been delayed from a November release
[00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:42.760]   We remember Apple said we're done for the year and so then I was like, okay
[00:09:42.760 --> 00:09:47.960]   I guess those aren't coming and then what german said after that which I thought was funny is he tried to extrapolate and he said
[00:09:47.960 --> 00:09:52.240]   Well, they probably won't do any product releases in January. They don't do that. They'll probably do a March event
[00:09:52.240 --> 00:09:56.920]   And I thought to myself I don't know these are products that in fact. I'm on the record
[00:09:56.920 --> 00:10:00.680]   There's a podcast where I say it's like just because there's no event in January
[00:10:00.680 --> 00:10:03.160]   It doesn't mean they can't do a press release and a video release
[00:10:03.160 --> 00:10:06.400]   In January remember we remember we spent these two products
[00:10:06.400 --> 00:10:10.640]   Clearly were on the verge of being released in November and then they pulled back
[00:10:10.720 --> 00:10:16.000]   So obviously they're like they're they're primed they're in the chamber. They're ready to go and here they are
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:22.200]   So these were the Mac books and the Mac mini by the way, I know we're completely bearing the lead new Mac mini
[00:10:22.200 --> 00:10:28.120]   New Mac book pro 14 inch new Mac Pro 16 inch. Did I miss anything? Those are the three nymphics
[00:10:28.120 --> 00:10:30.840]   And those are clearly
[00:10:30.840 --> 00:10:37.720]   Delayed by the covid zero policy that had shut down those factories. They make these a quanta. Where do they make these do we know?
[00:10:37.720 --> 00:10:46.560]   I don't know it is they did have a bunch of escalating delays over time, right? That led to the M2 air being delayed
[00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:49.600]   And it feels like everything just kind of got pushed back
[00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:55.800]   It's also possible though that they just decided while they were working on their November product releases
[00:10:55.800 --> 00:11:00.040]   They're like why why are we pushing this out? Let's wait till January. We'll have more of them in stock
[00:11:00.040 --> 00:11:06.520]   We have other products to plug these aren't really stocking stuffers right get your get your friend a 16 inch Mac book
[00:11:06.520 --> 00:11:11.120]   Pro under the tree we could probably survive holding them until January, but yeah
[00:11:11.120 --> 00:11:14.920]   But they clearly that was the that was the issue is they thought this was gonna be an end
[00:11:14.920 --> 00:11:18.360]   22 thing and it ended up being they'd like to do for the
[00:11:18.360 --> 00:11:21.880]   Buyers to be able to buy them for Christmas in the holidays, right?
[00:11:21.880 --> 00:11:26.480]   January's not I can't imagine January's is because you've got budgets. You've got to spend
[00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:31.440]   January's kind of do we worst time to release some I would think do we know what the return policy is because I know
[00:11:31.440 --> 00:11:35.280]   There's a bunch of people in office hours that had just bought mag minis of course at the end of the year like well
[00:11:35.280 --> 00:11:37.680]   They're not gonna make any for a while. I'm not a grace period
[00:11:37.680 --> 00:11:38.800]   I don't know how long it is though
[00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:41.200]   I think it's like 30 days and so if you have one out there
[00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:43.880]   You might want to check with your Apple store right back take it back
[00:11:43.880 --> 00:11:48.080]   Get the new one because the other thing is is the price dropped so not only did they did they do
[00:11:48.080 --> 00:11:54.040]   They brought from 699 to 599 for the base unit, which is a very powerful computer
[00:11:54.040 --> 00:11:59.000]   Yeah, you know, so it's very very powerful is that M2 or M1 base that that's the M2
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.240]   It's M2 a gig
[00:12:01.240 --> 00:12:06.280]   You now can if you work hard at it can spend $4,500 on a Mac mini
[00:12:06.280 --> 00:12:10.280]   I did look this morning. I was like I just max everything out
[00:12:10.280 --> 00:12:18.320]   That's why the Mac mini is one of the most important max in the entire lineup everything included because it is it is the
[00:12:18.320 --> 00:12:20.240]   I don't have a lot of money, but I want to Mac
[00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:22.200]   It's the $500.99 solution
[00:12:22.200 --> 00:12:24.760]   It is also the I want a workstation
[00:12:24.760 --> 00:12:28.800]   But I want several workstations for all my office or I want a workstation
[00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:34.240]   But I don't need to have my brain hammered to death by by more cores than I absolutely need
[00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:37.280]   I don't need the tower configuration replaceable drives
[00:12:37.280 --> 00:12:41.160]   I mean, I can't think of any if Apple were to cancel the Mac mini
[00:12:41.160 --> 00:12:42.880]   I don't believe that they're gonna do that
[00:12:42.880 --> 00:12:47.000]   But if that were to happen I would know that my goodness some huge
[00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:54.160]   Fault in philosophy has just changed inside of Apple because it solves so many problems for Apple and its customers
[00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:55.720]   It's like a pressure release valve
[00:12:55.720 --> 00:13:02.000]   It basically is the if that we don't make a Mac that fits you we make this and it fits everybody else, right?
[00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:06.560]   It's a and I don't know. I'm getting a vibe to given that there's a lot of comparisons
[00:13:06.560 --> 00:13:12.560]   That are like the 27 is the studio display and the Mac mini and they talk a lot about that like compared to an old
[00:13:12.560 --> 00:13:14.120]   I Mac and I thought you know
[00:13:14.120 --> 00:13:19.720]   I'm starting to believe those reports that the big I Mac isn't coming back because
[00:13:19.720 --> 00:13:24.580]   Between the studio display or some other 27 inch display and this new Mac mini
[00:13:25.160 --> 00:13:32.360]   It's a lot of me. I mean, it does that not fill the need or the Mac studio fill the need that maybe that bigger I Mac
[00:13:32.360 --> 00:13:38.840]   Fulfilled I don't and I'm also curious how many monitors the pro support. So the pro has more thunderbolts
[00:13:38.840 --> 00:13:43.280]   I believe it's it's now fourth underbolt. They did not oh the pro Mac mini. Let's get this
[00:13:43.280 --> 00:13:46.120]   Mac mini so there's an M2
[00:13:46.120 --> 00:13:52.680]   8 core and 10 core 8 gigs of RAM and then there's the M2 pro 10 core
[00:13:53.120 --> 00:13:55.120]   CPU 16 core GPU and
[00:13:55.120 --> 00:14:03.960]   Starting point is 16 gigs. So you're saying and for not one not two but three not four but three not three but four
[00:14:03.960 --> 00:14:10.280]   Thunderbolt four ports a lot of us pay attention to that because you know we like with my Mac studio
[00:14:10.280 --> 00:14:13.080]   It's full for all of the ball all the ports are
[00:14:13.080 --> 00:14:17.240]   My poor gigabit ethernet and headphone jack and two USB a ports
[00:14:17.240 --> 00:14:23.520]   So this is really like a short stack Mac studio is what this and it's Alex. It's three its three displays
[00:14:23.520 --> 00:14:29.880]   I'm on the on the pro model also. Let's I mean, we're kind of back back back into this story
[00:14:29.880 --> 00:14:37.120]   But one of the big parts of this new Mac mini story is it is literally the first Apple silicon at the pro tier on
[00:14:37.120 --> 00:14:40.800]   The desktop you've had the base model M1 and M2
[00:14:41.160 --> 00:14:45.760]   You've had the the super fast Macs and ultra on the Mac studio
[00:14:45.760 --> 00:14:53.920]   But what you haven't had is that one in the middle the the pro that gives you a little bit more more core more GPU more RAM more
[00:14:53.920 --> 00:14:55.680]   displays and
[00:14:55.680 --> 00:15:02.680]   That higher end Mac mini model is going to give you that and in fact if you if you spec it out to about the same amount of RAM and
[00:15:02.680 --> 00:15:09.480]   Storage as the Mac studio the base model Mac studio it basically comes right up to the price of the Mac studio
[00:15:10.440 --> 00:15:15.640]   With the same number of cores. So it's it's like I mean they did plan it out. It's like they planned it
[00:15:15.640 --> 00:15:16.520]   They did plan it out
[00:15:16.520 --> 00:15:22.200]   But it's a good fit because there was there was a piece missing under the Mac studio if you wanted a desktop
[00:15:22.200 --> 00:15:25.400]   Because it was way too far down to the M1 mini
[00:15:25.400 --> 00:15:25.840]   Yeah
[00:15:25.840 --> 00:15:28.600]   And now with the M1 and the or the M2 and the M2 pro
[00:15:28.600 --> 00:15:35.120]   Apple's got kind of like a coherent Apple silicon desktops had this been out last year. I might have bought this instead of a Mac studio
[00:15:35.120 --> 00:15:38.000]   I don't really need the Mac studio on my desk. This would have been perfect
[00:15:38.360 --> 00:15:45.560]   Yeah, the the interesting thing is I think that the the hard drive space is the it's the same chip that is doing
[00:15:45.560 --> 00:15:50.800]   It's doing it for the studio. I believe I'm not a hundred percent sure you get up to eight terabytes and so the
[00:15:50.800 --> 00:15:58.800]   What I'm spending two thousand dollars more or twelve hundred dollars more I would have been tempted to do that because it the drive is
[00:15:58.800 --> 00:16:02.880]   Screaming fast like I am on my studio. Where's the cut off?
[00:16:02.880 --> 00:16:10.320]   You don't want the 512 right is it is the two I think is really where the price comes like it starts to really arc after two
[00:16:10.320 --> 00:16:16.880]   But but I I would get as much if you're doing video or you're doing anything else like on my on my studio. I have
[00:16:16.880 --> 00:16:24.400]   Only put one I only put one terabyte in because I thought that you know I always have external drives for everything
[00:16:24.400 --> 00:16:30.320]   I'm working on the problem is my external and the in the raid. It's got four. It's got four MV ames
[00:16:30.320 --> 00:16:35.160]   And it's half the speed is almost like unified memory. This storage is so close to the CPU
[00:16:35.160 --> 00:16:36.640]   It's it's really it says fast
[00:16:36.640 --> 00:16:44.280]   It could be you I should have mentioned that if you were if you want to pay 300 bucks more you can get a 12 core CPU with 19 core GPU
[00:16:44.280 --> 00:16:51.560]   But there's the big limitation and this is artificial, but I'm sure this is why they did this 32 gigs is the max memory
[00:16:51.560 --> 00:16:56.680]   So if you need more you not on the then you're the laptop because the laptop I think goes to 96
[00:16:58.360 --> 00:17:01.320]   It's the difference between pro and max
[00:17:01.320 --> 00:17:07.320]   Right the pro the pro chip is in between the low end and the max and and so the Mac mini
[00:17:07.320 --> 00:17:12.440]   This is why the Mac minios coherent with the Mac studio is because the Mac mini will take you in slots
[00:17:12.440 --> 00:17:18.240]   Sort of a and B the M2 and the M2 pro if you want to go up to see which is and they all scale
[00:17:18.240 --> 00:17:23.200]   It actually I think is more coherent than in the old Intel days where there were a whole bunch of different Intel chips
[00:17:23.200 --> 00:17:27.320]   And then Apple picked and chip chose and and then some of them had different features now
[00:17:27.320 --> 00:17:33.160]   It's sort of like they built this thing to go M2 M2 pro M2 max and then presumably, you know
[00:17:33.160 --> 00:17:37.360]   M2 ultra and and it just kind of scales up
[00:17:37.360 --> 00:17:39.920]   So if you look at the M2 pro and say that's not enough
[00:17:39.920 --> 00:17:44.080]   Apple's answer will be then you want to move up to the the studio. Yeah
[00:17:44.080 --> 00:17:51.720]   Or the studio or if you want to lap you can actually get a 16 inch laptop with 96 gigs or yeah or the M2 max on the pro yeah
[00:17:51.720 --> 00:17:57.080]   So one of the things that we did note
[00:17:57.080 --> 00:18:05.000]   Maybe it was just to make me feel better is that the M2 is not as big a jump from the M1 as the M1 was from Intel
[00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:12.360]   That's true. It is. I mean I think about these systems, especially the laptops when we talk about them and
[00:18:12.360 --> 00:18:18.160]   You know, I still think the biggest appeal of the M2 is from people who stayed on Intel and we're like
[00:18:18.160 --> 00:18:23.960]   I'm gonna sit out that first generation about the silicon because the M1 to M2. I mean the cores are faster
[00:18:23.960 --> 00:18:31.240]   If you're on the base model you get the all the pro resin coating blocks and stuff that were only on the high end chips and M1
[00:18:31.240 --> 00:18:36.880]   But basically it's just the course right the CPU cores are faster the GPU cores are faster
[00:18:36.880 --> 00:18:40.720]   Everything's a little bit better. I don't think anybody who's got an M1 MacBook Pro
[00:18:40.720 --> 00:18:47.640]   Should be super sad about today, right? Like I think this is an incremental score that because I just bought a
[00:18:48.200 --> 00:18:54.400]   M1 MacBook Pro for my son a couple of months ago because I thought well I'm give up and
[00:18:54.400 --> 00:19:00.720]   I don't want him to feel like he's got something less. I did say there'll probably a new one at some point
[00:19:00.720 --> 00:19:06.040]   I didn't think it'd be this quick. I wouldn't wait it had I known and that's what you were saying Andy. That's why these embargoes
[00:19:06.040 --> 00:19:11.760]   Grind a little bit because people are making buying decisions. That's the value of Mark Gurman's reports, right?
[00:19:11.760 --> 00:19:14.960]   Yeah, he is giving people a little bit of a heads up and he figured Apple
[00:19:14.960 --> 00:19:19.680]   They do have a very liberal return policy for the first few weeks of a new product, right? Right?
[00:19:19.680 --> 00:19:23.480]   Right, and of course you can't expect them to say hey by all means
[00:19:23.480 --> 00:19:28.760]   Our third quarter of revenues, yeah
[00:19:28.760 --> 00:19:34.920]   But yeah, it's just it's the only time it kind of gets up my noses when like that's you see that as like the official Apple line
[00:19:34.920 --> 00:19:41.200]   Oh, we want to preserve the surprise and the delight saying okay look if that's the reason I can deal with less surprise in my life
[00:19:42.400 --> 00:19:46.560]   They want to preserve revenue from the previous product keeps selling
[00:19:46.560 --> 00:19:51.400]   There's a famous anecdote and technology the Osborne effect were Adam Osborne
[00:19:51.400 --> 00:19:57.560]   Who's long gone had a portable computer the Osborne one that was very very popular very big seller
[00:19:57.560 --> 00:20:02.320]   Mistakenly he said there's gonna be a new Osborne 2 months before it was available
[00:20:02.320 --> 00:20:08.600]   Killed the Osborne one and eventually the company so that's the you don't want to Osborne yourself is what people will say
[00:20:08.600 --> 00:20:14.280]   Yeah, and I think it's generally prudent if you're shipping not to say anything until you've been gonna ship a week
[00:20:14.280 --> 00:20:20.080]   Well, you can tell though by the way all of these things are available if you get the base model in a week
[00:20:20.080 --> 00:20:26.480]   Next Tuesday and even if you don't even if like I spec the hell out of this thing is still available to 31st
[00:20:26.480 --> 00:20:31.560]   So my guess is the elves over Christmas. We're just cranking these things out as fast
[00:20:31.560 --> 00:20:36.200]   I think so they have a lot of stock right this is not gonna be the one where they go
[00:20:36.200 --> 00:20:41.040]   We could have sold more if we'd only had more they are they have they have made a lot of them
[00:20:41.040 --> 00:20:45.240]   That's why I was such a surprise to everybody with new cases. I was Nordic wood with dowels
[00:20:45.240 --> 00:20:50.000]   Those elves love Nordic wood so candy cane logo
[00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:56.560]   That's another question beautiful beautiful carving is this a redesign from the M1's 14s and 16s or the M1 mini?
[00:20:56.560 --> 00:20:58.880]   No, I
[00:20:58.880 --> 00:21:00.880]   I'm curious about the mini because the mini
[00:21:00.880 --> 00:21:04.560]   had had like an empty space in it and
[00:21:05.160 --> 00:21:07.160]   Footprint of it is actually slightly different
[00:21:07.160 --> 00:21:12.280]   So I wonder somebody's gonna have to you know open one up and see what's in there the Macbook Pro
[00:21:12.280 --> 00:21:17.120]   I would imagine is almost identical to the old model right because they just did their refresh there
[00:21:17.120 --> 00:21:19.040]   And this really is more of what we you know
[00:21:19.040 --> 00:21:23.840]   I always call a speed bump where they just kind of refresh to the latest tech and let it keep going
[00:21:23.840 --> 00:21:28.560]   At least on the laptops they haven't added any ports or anything like that. There's no no
[00:21:28.560 --> 00:21:31.680]   But you're right that Mac mini the high-end Mac mini config
[00:21:31.680 --> 00:21:37.360]   Which is replacing the old Intel Mac mini that was still in the product line the the space gray one
[00:21:37.360 --> 00:21:41.000]   It's gone and now we're just back to a high-end M2 Mac mini
[00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:45.800]   That's got the all the extra Thunderbolt ports and we'll drive more displays and all of those in the apples words
[00:21:45.800 --> 00:21:47.800]   It has more muscle in more hustle
[00:21:47.800 --> 00:21:55.200]   Give you say so yeah, I thought that the release strategy was interesting, you know to have a full fully built
[00:21:55.200 --> 00:21:57.640]   presentation
[00:21:57.640 --> 00:22:01.680]   For but no live stream and yes no warning
[00:22:01.680 --> 00:22:08.160]   They put this out or when did they put it out six a.m. Is when they generally
[00:22:08.160 --> 00:22:11.520]   Pacific nine a.m. Eastern
[00:22:11.520 --> 00:22:17.680]   Yeah, I think I think they would have done better if they had done it live told us an up
[00:22:17.680 --> 00:22:21.280]   There's gonna be an update on it and the reason for that is that I found myself very
[00:22:21.280 --> 00:22:26.600]   Impatient so when when we're watching live and we do a kind of watch parties within office hours
[00:22:26.600 --> 00:22:27.800]   And so we kind of talk about it
[00:22:27.800 --> 00:22:31.920]   We're talking about things that are going on and give us something to do when we're not when I'm not watching live
[00:22:31.920 --> 00:22:35.960]   I really just want the highlight real like I don't really care about the build up that they do
[00:22:35.960 --> 00:22:39.760]   You know all the superlatives and all the setup and everything else when it's not live
[00:22:39.760 --> 00:22:40.600]   I don't want to hear it
[00:22:40.600 --> 00:22:44.560]   You know like I just I realized I very quickly wanted to just jump until I saw a graphic of the chip
[00:22:44.560 --> 00:22:50.560]   And then I'd back up a little bit and watch through it, you know and so I think that was a little started with a 48 second
[00:22:50.560 --> 00:22:53.480]   promo reel for the M1
[00:22:54.280 --> 00:22:58.560]   Weirdly and then go to John Turnus who is the SVP engineering
[00:22:58.560 --> 00:23:03.120]   Inside the Steve Jobs theater, so this looks exactly like the video you to see it
[00:23:03.120 --> 00:23:07.240]   At our base got the model if we ever thought that they were gonna go back to the day
[00:23:07.240 --> 00:23:13.260]   It feels in fact like this might have been produced originally for November but notice
[00:23:13.260 --> 00:23:20.720]   X pointed out January 17th is in the in the menu bar. Yeah, but I mean all that all that stuff is special effects
[00:23:22.520 --> 00:23:24.520]   Change the date on the menu bar
[00:23:24.520 --> 00:23:28.600]   I might have to get I'm involved
[00:23:28.600 --> 00:23:37.920]   So these are all M2's there's M2
[00:23:37.920 --> 00:23:40.480]   This is they started with the mini this M2
[00:23:40.480 --> 00:23:47.480]   Regular and in the mini only ups up to the M2 pro and then in this 14 and 16th you can go to the max
[00:23:48.680 --> 00:23:53.720]   Is the max merely accessing more memory and more GPU CPUs? Yes
[00:23:53.720 --> 00:24:01.400]   Yeah more performance cores and way more GPUs more I think it's twice the memory bandwidth
[00:24:01.400 --> 00:24:03.360]   So is this
[00:24:03.360 --> 00:24:08.120]   Remind me so the M1 Pro was still a single core was it dual core?
[00:24:08.120 --> 00:24:15.560]   And then they went to max which was for core or no that was the dual core there's many there are many cores
[00:24:15.560 --> 00:24:18.520]   Right, but what you're thinking of is is G on the die
[00:24:18.520 --> 00:24:23.000]   I guess or the ultra the ultra is two of those max
[00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:30.200]   Crossed yeah crisscross to place or whatever but they all and what's interesting too is that the the core account?
[00:24:30.200 --> 00:24:32.680]   Isn't actually
[00:24:32.680 --> 00:24:39.280]   That different between the the pro and the max and all of that. It's the it's the GPUs
[00:24:39.280 --> 00:24:43.000]   Here's the quilt the product quilt. Oh, I got a positive
[00:24:43.640 --> 00:24:50.980]   They keep self-starting. Here's the product quilt for this is the base M2. Yes. Oh see keep starting
[00:24:50.980 --> 00:24:53.280]   Apple don't want me to look at that quilt too long
[00:24:53.280 --> 00:24:58.360]   Then there's another then we go back to Johnny in the lab
[00:24:58.360 --> 00:25:05.040]   Or is that turn us that's Johnny turn is not Johnny Saruji and then we go back in lab. We have another quilt
[00:25:05.040 --> 00:25:08.840]   For I don't know what M2 pro
[00:25:11.040 --> 00:25:16.720]   Five people one small business. I don't want to see that stuff. I don't care about making sweatshirts with my M2 pro here
[00:25:16.720 --> 00:25:21.320]   We go here. We go. I'm gonna. I'm gonna get a quilt. Let's get a quilt
[00:25:21.320 --> 00:25:28.880]   That I don't know why they take us down on YouTube for showing these videos. It's almost impossible
[00:25:28.880 --> 00:25:32.840]   There's the the insane apple graph that has no
[00:25:32.840 --> 00:25:36.240]   No, zero
[00:25:36.240 --> 00:25:38.480]   Makes no sense
[00:25:38.480 --> 00:25:42.360]   It's 20. It's faster right faster. It's faster
[00:25:42.360 --> 00:25:47.700]   Yeah, don't you like that that they make it they make theirs 100% it's always
[00:25:47.700 --> 00:25:53.240]   Whatever it is trails. Yeah, you know our old stuff labels are about it, which is it's a weird
[00:25:53.240 --> 00:25:58.080]   I have questions as somebody who used to work for a magazine to publish charts and I publish charts myself
[00:25:58.080 --> 00:26:03.080]   It's there's some charting issues going on here, but it's marketing right this is market. They actually call it performance marketing
[00:26:03.080 --> 00:26:05.080]   That's what they call it inside Apple
[00:26:05.080 --> 00:26:11.480]   But the thing to remember about the pro and the and the max is that the max is all about doubling the GPUs and
[00:26:11.480 --> 00:26:17.280]   Doubling the memory bandwidth. So the cores don't actually change. It's the base model is 10 cores
[00:26:17.280 --> 00:26:24.000]   Which is six performance and four efficiency and then you ramp up to the the higher end model with 12?
[00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:28.800]   Core is eight performance for efficiency, but the big jump is when you go to max
[00:26:28.800 --> 00:26:32.320]   It's still 12 cores, but it's of CPU
[00:26:32.320 --> 00:26:35.640]   But it goes from you know 19 to 30 30
[00:26:35.640 --> 00:26:38.480]   Course GPU
[00:26:38.480 --> 00:26:42.600]   You can configure it up to 38 and and you can't
[00:26:42.600 --> 00:26:47.760]   We heard those problems potentially with the graphics processing
[00:26:47.760 --> 00:26:52.000]   On the a14 that this is maybe too
[00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:59.560]   No, this this is not based on the current a chip. It's based on the previous generation. It's a 13 kids
[00:27:00.200 --> 00:27:06.240]   So they you know kick it down the road 30% faster GPU 20 up to 30% faster GPU
[00:27:06.240 --> 00:27:08.600]   It's it's so it's it's a just to be clear
[00:27:08.600 --> 00:27:14.120]   It's a 15 a 16 is the one where there was that story about them having to go back to the old GPU
[00:27:14.120 --> 00:27:16.880]   The numbers are very confusing. No, I'm saying they are
[00:27:16.880 --> 00:27:20.440]   67 numbers transistors neural engine
[00:27:20.440 --> 00:27:24.760]   40% faster. It's got the pro res playback
[00:27:25.520 --> 00:27:32.320]   That's a big deal 5 nanometer technology. No three nanometers yet with is three minute nanometers the a16
[00:27:32.320 --> 00:27:34.800]   Do we know is that gonna be?
[00:27:34.800 --> 00:27:37.240]   Yeah, I
[00:27:37.240 --> 00:27:40.160]   Don't know if it's still I don't think it's gonna turn that corn that fast. Yeah
[00:27:40.160 --> 00:27:42.840]   Well TSMC has it
[00:27:42.840 --> 00:27:52.760]   Okay, I can go through the whole thing longest ever battery life on a Mac. That's for 22 hours. That's in for the 14
[00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:58.440]   Or the 16. I think that's the 16. I didn't watch this you could tell I
[00:27:58.440 --> 00:28:01.760]   Don't know
[00:28:01.760 --> 00:28:04.400]   It's a blank now. She's standing from a blank wall
[00:28:04.400 --> 00:28:08.440]   I'm not playing the audio because it will take us down on YouTube if I do
[00:28:08.440 --> 00:28:15.200]   96 gigs of unified memory sure Jason Snell can play clips in his show, but not me
[00:28:15.200 --> 00:28:17.960]   Don't know why it's just the rule
[00:28:17.960 --> 00:28:20.880]   So lots of battery life in
[00:28:21.640 --> 00:28:25.080]   Something law. It's longest with a lot of o's
[00:28:25.080 --> 00:28:28.520]   Yeah, we're live streaming this desk. So there
[00:28:28.520 --> 00:28:31.800]   Streaming it. No, no don't don't peek and be used
[00:28:31.800 --> 00:28:36.960]   What you're seeing that's not a live stream. That's just it's
[00:28:36.960 --> 00:28:40.440]   It's 20 so they made this 22 hour claim
[00:28:40.440 --> 00:28:46.200]   But on their website under tech specs it actually says that it's 18 hours of Apple TV app movie playback
[00:28:46.200 --> 00:28:50.480]   12 hours wireless web, but you know, it's good, right?
[00:28:50.480 --> 00:28:53.200]   That's those are so where's the 20 you come from?
[00:28:53.200 --> 00:28:57.160]   I think the 22 is the 16. Yeah, so the 16 got the bigger battery
[00:28:57.160 --> 00:29:04.240]   It's 22 hour movie playback and actually say it's like six notches up from from the lowest setting on brightness
[00:29:04.240 --> 00:29:07.480]   And then they just let it run and yeah, and so nothing
[00:29:07.480 --> 00:29:09.280]   I would do a friend about this right?
[00:29:09.280 --> 00:29:16.560]   I mean, who's are you up for 22 like hours working on your MacBook Pro if you are I guess this is the one for you
[00:29:16.840 --> 00:29:22.760]   But but what about the days when like you've got you didn't have you forgot to plug it in and you just need four
[00:29:22.760 --> 00:29:25.840]   Hours the next day before you get the charger. Yes. Yeah
[00:29:25.840 --> 00:29:28.760]   More more more hours is always more better. Yeah
[00:29:28.760 --> 00:29:33.280]   Yeah, they have a whole you know go down to the footnotes and you can read the
[00:29:33.280 --> 00:29:40.920]   Testing conduct by Apple in November in December what you had these then using pre production 16 inch MacBook Pro models of the Apple M2 Pro 12 core
[00:29:41.400 --> 00:29:49.080]   19 core 32 gigs 8 terabyte tested under a using a one-minute picture in picture project with 23 streams of Apple Pro res
[00:29:49.080 --> 00:29:51.080]   422 video at
[00:29:51.080 --> 00:29:55.160]   2160 resolution 29.97 frames per second
[00:29:55.160 --> 00:30:01.520]   And it's approximate. It's approximate, you know, we approximate it's all approximate
[00:30:01.520 --> 00:30:06.680]   Still yeah more bad at the so so but is that fair?
[00:30:07.720 --> 00:30:13.080]   Is marketing I know but this is the is this they wouldn't say it's thought it's the longest ever
[00:30:13.080 --> 00:30:18.720]   Would they say that if it weren't is what I'm saying no that's based on their tests?
[00:30:18.720 --> 00:30:21.320]   Yes, but they say every time
[00:30:21.320 --> 00:30:27.040]   They know they know that if they're called on that and they're cooking their their figures that they're gonna get in trouble
[00:30:27.040 --> 00:30:33.280]   And I also say the people who are in that department are people who used to work at Mackerels with me back in the day
[00:30:33.280 --> 00:30:38.880]   Okay, they are they're good people does Apple like look if they do five different tests
[00:30:38.880 --> 00:30:43.280]   Which one is Apple gonna pick they're gonna pick the one where Apple looks the best right because it is marketing
[00:30:43.280 --> 00:30:47.360]   But it's based on reality. That's and that's not much is true
[00:30:47.360 --> 00:30:50.440]   I want them to say number you see figures based on reality
[00:30:50.440 --> 00:30:57.420]   It's based on reality, but but the number you see is chosen. I mean is it cherry picked? Yeah, probably because it's marketing right
[00:30:57.420 --> 00:31:00.080]   They have several realities for which to choose yes
[00:31:00.880 --> 00:31:04.280]   They're as a to try to our company they can make several realities
[00:31:04.280 --> 00:31:08.280]   Exactly the last thing you want to do is be like guys. I got bad news. I did a battery test
[00:31:08.280 --> 00:31:12.160]   I did our regular battery test and it's the best ever but I did this different battery test and it's bad
[00:31:12.160 --> 00:31:16.880]   And they're like well, we won't use that one. I mean that's it's not hard. Yeah, it's no
[00:31:16.880 --> 00:31:21.520]   Let's not use that one. Yeah, okay, but we can we can fairly fairly well trust this
[00:31:21.520 --> 00:31:26.800]   I think that it's my Apple standards against its own products also means that it's less likely to be
[00:31:26.920 --> 00:31:32.800]   Kind of fakery because it's their own products and not like versus the competition where it starts to get a little weird and to be fair
[00:31:32.800 --> 00:31:36.880]   I don't think there's any PC in this class that has anywhere near this kind of battery life
[00:31:36.880 --> 00:31:41.240]   Although there's a new AMD chip that looks pretty good and it's possible this could happen
[00:31:41.240 --> 00:31:46.800]   But Apple really has leapfrogged the industry with battery life and that's one of the real reasons to get an Apple laptop
[00:31:46.800 --> 00:31:51.600]   There's nothing you can go close really in this class again. That's the really the complex
[00:31:52.400 --> 00:31:57.720]   Problem for everybody else in the industry is that Apple now has an incredible amount of control over its own destiny
[00:31:57.720 --> 00:32:00.520]   You know and its ability to build more efficient systems
[00:32:00.520 --> 00:32:07.920]   Is really it can move much faster and and then everyone else because everyone else is cobbling together
[00:32:07.920 --> 00:32:12.880]   Right, they have to have the OS agree with what the hardware is doing and then they have to have a more
[00:32:12.880 --> 00:32:20.360]   Environments environment that's part of the problem right knows exactly what hardware it's going on and that and that seems to be seeping into dogmas
[00:32:20.360 --> 00:32:25.640]   Well, it's not to there is a we're hearing more rumors that Apple wants to manufacture its own panels
[00:32:25.640 --> 00:32:32.120]   At least for at least for phones and watches and that's not because they don't think that Samsung and the rest aren't making really high quality panels
[00:32:32.120 --> 00:32:35.720]   It's because they want to optimize power for every every other component inside the device
[00:32:35.720 --> 00:32:40.720]   So well, it's automatic somebody Apple at Apple said about the M1
[00:32:40.720 --> 00:32:46.480]   But I think it's absolutely still true which is one of the things the people on the inside
[00:32:47.280 --> 00:32:55.120]   Know and that they try to let the public in on a little bit is it used to be they took products off a shelf from Intel and
[00:32:55.120 --> 00:32:58.960]   Made a computer right and now the chip design
[00:32:58.960 --> 00:33:01.400]   The chip is designed
[00:33:01.400 --> 00:33:08.040]   Knowing what computers that chip will go into right like it's it's all kind of purpose built when they made
[00:33:08.040 --> 00:33:15.160]   Several years ago when they're like okay m2 pro. Where's that gonna go? They said Mac mini and
[00:33:16.040 --> 00:33:20.440]   MacBook Pro and maybe that's it or maybe there's some other stuff like they know
[00:33:20.440 --> 00:33:27.440]   What models for each chip and that that is a big advantage because they don't build features in that they don't think those models need
[00:33:27.440 --> 00:33:31.760]   They know what the cooling is gonna be they know what the power constraints are. It's really
[00:33:31.760 --> 00:33:39.160]   You know, it's an advantage. It's a big advantage for them and they're writing that they're making the hardware and writing the code that runs in the hard
[00:33:39.160 --> 00:33:43.960]   Yeah, the entire infrastructure and so and then they're telling the developers how here's how you take advantage of it
[00:33:44.400 --> 00:33:48.880]   Every developer that we talked to is like if you just write it the way Apple tells you to write it and you use all the
[00:33:48.880 --> 00:33:56.960]   Libraries they give you it gets faster way faster because everything is optimized to go through that system and for people who used to write their own
[00:33:56.960 --> 00:34:01.960]   Their own libraries or I'm gonna do it my own way. They're starting to fall behind
[00:34:01.960 --> 00:34:04.720]   They're having stability issues. They're having you know
[00:34:04.720 --> 00:34:11.120]   Difficulties writing their own engines and that's gonna probably continue to be harder and harder because the entire system is flowing
[00:34:11.120 --> 00:34:18.040]   You know as as a single unit which is never we've never seen before Jason. Do you have machines in house or no?
[00:34:18.040 --> 00:34:23.440]   I do not you do not you will at some next week. I can I mean yeah
[00:34:23.440 --> 00:34:27.640]   I definitely plan on reviewing them, but I don't have anything now. Okay, so next Tuesday
[00:34:27.640 --> 00:34:35.680]   I was pan around the room and make sure that they're I believe you I don't I just I wouldn't like you
[00:34:35.680 --> 00:34:37.600]   I would be evasive if I had to be evasive
[00:34:37.600 --> 00:34:42.700]   We know how the I don't have them there are no new products in my in my
[00:34:42.700 --> 00:34:50.900]   I just I just I just got an idea for for a canary like you put like a Newton message pad on a shelf behind you
[00:34:50.900 --> 00:34:57.420]   That and that that means that that means as long as that that means that you don't have anything under NDA from from Apple
[00:34:57.420 --> 00:35:02.520]   If we happen to see that it's not there you know like anything you just rearrange stuff on your shelf
[00:35:02.520 --> 00:35:07.120]   What if the you know what what if the the lava lamp is not lit?
[00:35:07.360 --> 00:35:14.600]   Like the secret code. Oh shoot. It just got turned on. Oh no, it's off. It's on. Oh, you're just messing with stop it
[00:35:14.600 --> 00:35:17.720]   Just stop it. So here are the family photos
[00:35:17.720 --> 00:35:22.840]   This is the M2 that we've had all along in our in our nice little Macbook
[00:35:22.840 --> 00:35:25.400]   M2 Macbook air, which I quite like
[00:35:25.400 --> 00:35:29.960]   100 gigabytes per second memory bandwidth 24 gigs of memory
[00:35:29.960 --> 00:35:35.120]   This is one thing that kind of threw me because I thought oh from now on everything will be a multiple of 24
[00:35:35.560 --> 00:35:40.160]   Mmm. No M2 Pro 32 gigs of unified memory
[00:35:40.160 --> 00:35:47.160]   But they did double the memory bandwidth is that cuz there is that cuz there's twice as much?
[00:35:47.160 --> 00:35:52.360]   I don't know what that it means. It means no, it's just twice as fast and then there's the M2
[00:35:52.360 --> 00:35:59.120]   Maxi oh, they're not in the family photos yet for the maxi
[00:35:59.120 --> 00:36:04.800]   So that's so this is the mini. That's why okay. I think I honestly
[00:36:04.800 --> 00:36:11.440]   I think the reason it's 24 is because they got hit so hard on their limit being 16 that they made an effort to get it to be two
[00:36:11.440 --> 00:36:18.280]   Banks of 12 yeah, and then on the higher end one on the pro they didn't feel they didn't quite feel the pressure to do that
[00:36:18.280 --> 00:36:23.600]   And so they're happy to keep it at two banks of 16. So we're gonna go back to the 32 multiples of 32 for the
[00:36:23.600 --> 00:36:32.440]   The pro and the max I guess so that's the mini let me let me let me go to the it's interesting the laptops
[00:36:32.800 --> 00:36:37.240]   Are really where you see the performance stuff? Yeah?
[00:36:37.240 --> 00:36:45.120]   Yeah, it's be I mean their examples are amazing right like I think it and I forgive me because I know this has been a topic forever here
[00:36:45.120 --> 00:36:51.280]   But this idea that how much computer do you really need like the Mac Pro performance is where they can boast
[00:36:51.280 --> 00:36:56.760]   They really can boast on the M2 pro and max performance the problem is in order to boast
[00:36:56.760 --> 00:36:59.720]   They have to get increasingly esoteric with the yeah
[00:36:59.720 --> 00:37:02.840]   I mean, it's not a cetera for Alex right for years everybody
[00:37:02.840 --> 00:37:10.080]   High end yeah, they promoted the mega Hertz myth and oh you don't want to look at numbers and now you want to look at numbers
[00:37:10.080 --> 00:37:11.720]   Because they got it. Well, yeah, and it's also
[00:37:11.720 --> 00:37:15.760]   It's not gonna be like look at a Microsoft Word or even look at Photoshop these days
[00:37:15.760 --> 00:37:19.360]   It's like look at look at the high end look at video editing
[00:37:19.360 --> 00:37:21.800]   and 3d and
[00:37:21.800 --> 00:37:27.680]   Compositing and they just the highest end stuff because that's where they can shine and they can blow away the competition
[00:37:27.960 --> 00:37:34.040]   It's just this question of like I think the truth is most people who are buying a Mac Pro are doing it for the screen of the ports
[00:37:34.040 --> 00:37:40.000]   And not for the super super high-end power, but it is there for the people who do need it now
[00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:42.560]   I'm gonna really throw my now I would throw myself because
[00:37:42.560 --> 00:37:50.360]   96 gigabytes, which is the max on the M2 max he is actually two times 32 plus 24
[00:37:50.360 --> 00:37:54.920]   24 is back baby. I don't know. I don't understand
[00:37:55.560 --> 00:38:00.720]   I'm really keen to see like a Mac two times 32 is 64. Oh
[00:38:00.720 --> 00:38:08.720]   It's three 32's never mind. I was here. I you're right. My math is bad. Okay. I need a computer to do this you understand
[00:38:08.720 --> 00:38:09.760]   I
[00:38:09.760 --> 00:38:13.560]   Yeah, 400 megabytes per second a memory bandwidth though
[00:38:13.560 --> 00:38:21.680]   That's I mean that's insane. I'm I'm I'm it really makes me wonder how many Mac Pro customers
[00:38:21.680 --> 00:38:28.360]   They're basically leaching off now. Well the people that were gee this there's just two bit went back when there was way too big a gap between
[00:38:28.360 --> 00:38:34.960]   The maximum you could performance you can get out of an Intel Mac mini versus what you get out of a basic spec
[00:38:34.960 --> 00:38:38.480]   Intel Mac Pro now a lot of those people are saying no
[00:38:38.480 --> 00:38:41.960]   This is the Mac mini well-spect out is gonna do everything I wanted to do
[00:38:41.960 --> 00:38:47.480]   And I'm really keen to see if when Apple comes out with a new updated Mac pros
[00:38:47.880 --> 00:38:54.400]   What is going to be the difference between a maxed out if you it's five thousand dollars or six thousand dollars to spend on
[00:38:54.400 --> 00:38:58.080]   The most performance in a Mac what would you get?
[00:38:58.080 --> 00:39:03.200]   Would you get a Mac mini at the top of the spec or would you get sort of an entry level or just above entry level Mac Pro?
[00:39:03.200 --> 00:39:09.280]   It's no longer really clear what these two well here's an interesting stat the Mac books can only do two external
[00:39:09.280 --> 00:39:13.600]   Displays while the mini can do three so if you want more displays you get a mini
[00:39:13.600 --> 00:39:17.480]   Well, it's a critical difference for me. Yeah, I think that I think number one is like
[00:39:17.480 --> 00:39:21.120]   I think the Mac pros I'd be surprised if they're any below six grand
[00:39:21.120 --> 00:39:23.160]   I think that that's gonna be the opening day
[00:39:23.160 --> 00:39:28.080]   They may start at ten because what what they have right now is they have Mac mini's they go up to forty five hundred dollars
[00:39:28.080 --> 00:39:31.360]   They've got yeah studios. They go up to ten or twelve thousand dollars
[00:39:31.360 --> 00:39:34.400]   And so I think your Mac Pro starts it
[00:39:34.400 --> 00:39:37.960]   I think it could start as high as ten thousand as low as six thousand dollars
[00:39:37.960 --> 00:39:42.880]   But that's that's about the where where it's gonna begin and what it's gonna number one is I do think I agree with
[00:39:42.880 --> 00:39:47.720]   Anti I think that the expectations now of a Mac Pro and what a Mac Pro looks like are very high
[00:39:47.720 --> 00:39:51.600]   So we say as a pro this is gonna be a beefy machine
[00:39:51.600 --> 00:39:55.080]   It is gonna be does not you know like it's here's a nice craft
[00:39:55.080 --> 00:40:00.040]   I do like it that Apple compares to them themselves see this little teeny we need line there
[00:40:00.040 --> 00:40:07.880]   That's an I7 Mac Pro see that little teeny see that really big long line there 16 times faster
[00:40:07.880 --> 00:40:11.360]   Well, and that's running at form and grill temperatures
[00:40:12.080 --> 00:40:17.360]   No, it's not though. That's the beauty of it the Intel is yes. Yes. Yes, right
[00:40:17.360 --> 00:40:22.880]   Yeah, but I think I think also you're gonna have it's the the pro is gonna give you the expandability like right now every time
[00:40:22.880 --> 00:40:27.120]   I want to add a card. I'm thinking about what kind of you know external
[00:40:27.120 --> 00:40:34.000]   You know whether it's sonnet or OWC or whatever what am I gonna put on the outside to put the card in the Mac Pro is gonna
[00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:39.560]   Have cards. I don't probably anywhere from two to six cards that are gonna be available to us in those in that Mac Pro
[00:40:39.560 --> 00:40:41.920]   And that's gonna that for pros. That's what they need
[00:40:41.920 --> 00:40:48.740]   The and then you're gonna have a very very fast machine that probably tops out at I'm gonna guess
[00:40:48.740 --> 00:40:52.200]   $80,000 is probably the holy yeah
[00:40:52.200 --> 00:40:56.080]   Rules me
[00:40:56.080 --> 00:40:58.640]   Pro and an Apple car
[00:40:58.640 --> 00:41:05.360]   Should I buy this house or a Mac Pro? I don't know and I know I know people I know people have the
[00:41:05.360 --> 00:41:08.240]   $60,000 version of the current one. Yeah, they said it's pretty fast
[00:41:08.240 --> 00:41:20.600]   Yeah, but I think that the thing is is that we'll see how far Apple goes, but you could you could see potentially a
[00:41:20.600 --> 00:41:23.160]   One terabyte one terabyte of RAM
[00:41:23.160 --> 00:41:27.600]   You know very very large, you know hard drive space, you know
[00:41:27.600 --> 00:41:31.120]   things that turn it into an entirely different level of machine and
[00:41:31.120 --> 00:41:37.680]   Again when you're doing really high-end visual effects when you're doing really like I used to I used to work on a machine that was
[00:41:37.680 --> 00:41:39.680]   $60,000
[00:41:39.680 --> 00:41:44.680]   You know a SGI an SGI machine and that was all we could use to you know
[00:41:44.680 --> 00:41:48.520]   Make that make that actually work so so it's not out of the question
[00:41:48.520 --> 00:41:55.200]   It just depends on what what kind of return are you gonna get and are and and what that opens up for is for the those
[00:41:55.200 --> 00:41:56.960]   developing for that
[00:41:56.960 --> 00:42:03.600]   It allows them to build assumptions into it. This is great tracing global illumination, you know from a 3d perspective
[00:42:04.440 --> 00:42:07.960]   And oftentimes time is money, you know and so it adds up
[00:42:07.960 --> 00:42:09.360]   And so I think it'll be really interesting
[00:42:09.360 --> 00:42:12.080]   I bet the pro is now like when you see the Mac mini here you're thinking
[00:42:12.080 --> 00:42:16.000]   I don't even know what they'd add to the yeah, like it's hard to imagine now
[00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:26.040]   So it looks like the displays are identical except for size right 14.2 16.2 on the Macbook pros
[00:42:26.040 --> 00:42:31.880]   But in every other respect 120 Hertz high contrast ratio all of that other stuff
[00:42:31.880 --> 00:42:37.040]   Yeah, these are the same computer essentially other than the battery size and the screen size
[00:42:37.040 --> 00:42:41.580]   Yeah, otherwise you're getting and the same as last time essentially to get a notch
[00:42:41.580 --> 00:42:47.840]   We're on the notch is limiting. Yeah, yeah, well and you know, we're this is what we're getting
[00:42:47.840 --> 00:42:54.120]   I'm not getting to get the monitor, but the the this is what we're about to buy a new computer for my for my parents in law and
[00:42:54.120 --> 00:43:01.240]   That 599 Mac mini with a new with a with the monitor is gonna replace a pretty old iMac that we got them before
[00:43:01.800 --> 00:43:02.720]   and
[00:43:02.720 --> 00:43:09.560]   It's just the perfect machine, you know to do that kind of thing and I you know, I don't I am curious where the iMac
[00:43:09.560 --> 00:43:15.200]   lives inside of this like really strong Mac and iMac pro you mean
[00:43:15.200 --> 00:43:20.500]   I don't think I don't think that you don't think that really makes sense. It doesn't know it doesn't make sense
[00:43:20.500 --> 00:43:23.660]   I don't think it does get a studio. I don't think it does get a studio with a monitor
[00:43:23.660 --> 00:43:31.200]   Having the 27 inch display means that you can even scale right like use a laptop or get the mini or get the high
[00:43:31.200 --> 00:43:36.280]   In mini or get the low end studio or get the high end studio or get the Mac pro like it is
[00:43:36.280 --> 00:43:42.880]   And that's I mean we all kind of got trained in iMac land because the only way to get a powerful Mac desktop was to buy a big
[00:43:42.880 --> 00:43:45.920]   I'm back and I feel like Apple is deprogramming us a little bit
[00:43:45.920 --> 00:43:48.040]   And I think a lot of us were talking about it for a long time
[00:43:48.040 --> 00:43:50.200]   We're like just make the Mac mini fat like this
[00:43:50.200 --> 00:43:52.960]   I am I at one point in time in pixel core
[00:43:52.960 --> 00:43:57.560]   I think I own 35 Mac minis and they're all glued to do all these little things and I was like
[00:43:57.560 --> 00:44:03.360]   I just wish they'd upgrade these things and I'm free went for years and it's so exciting to see these little Mac minis that
[00:44:03.360 --> 00:44:06.040]   We all knew were that powerful and I think it was just a heat issue
[00:44:06.040 --> 00:44:11.680]   And now that they've gotten through that we're just seeing this incredible expansion of these really powerful little machines
[00:44:11.680 --> 00:44:15.000]   Yeah, I still think that the iMac Pro is not long for the spruels
[00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:20.480]   I think was I think was really clear that this was a stopgap after the failure of the the Quaker Roadspox
[00:44:20.480 --> 00:44:26.480]   The cylinder shaped Mac Pro they needed something super powerful that would make power users happy
[00:44:26.480 --> 00:44:32.920]   It was the easiest one to build it was the clumsiest one to repair and now there's really no need for it now that you've got
[00:44:32.920 --> 00:44:34.760]   Apple Silicon across the board
[00:44:34.760 --> 00:44:41.160]   I've got Apple Silicon on the on the Mac mini that people can pair with their own displays and upgrade a Mac without upgrading the display
[00:44:41.160 --> 00:44:45.760]   I don't I really hope that Apple decides to rebrand sort of the iMac as
[00:44:45.760 --> 00:44:51.560]   Something akin to the original Mac the personable one the ones you have on your desktop and your kids desktop
[00:44:51.560 --> 00:44:54.120]   And the ones you buy a dozen of for the office
[00:44:54.120 --> 00:44:58.240]   This is not but when you want power when you need to spec something out for specific tasks
[00:44:58.240 --> 00:45:02.280]   That's really mission important. That's when you go to a Mac mini or that's when you go to a Mac Pro
[00:45:02.280 --> 00:45:05.960]   John do you want to buy a new Mac mini do we need one?
[00:45:05.960 --> 00:45:09.240]   That's two different questions. I understand
[00:45:09.240 --> 00:45:14.760]   Alright box there
[00:45:14.760 --> 00:45:17.400]   Alright
[00:45:17.400 --> 00:45:19.560]   What does it do?
[00:45:19.560 --> 00:45:22.280]   Huh for zoom myself for zoom I so
[00:45:23.240 --> 00:45:27.400]   But Alex said we could just use that old little tiny 8 gigabyte RAM more
[00:45:27.400 --> 00:45:34.600]   It's working fine, but we really need to put that in the conference room. Okay. Let's put it in the conference room
[00:45:34.600 --> 00:45:38.640]   And put it put it in perspective
[00:45:38.640 --> 00:45:46.840]   I think Andy sent me that the the M2 air is at eight SDI outputs from from zoom is 30 to 35%
[00:45:46.840 --> 00:45:49.000]   CPU utilization
[00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:54.120]   So and that so those the Mac mini will do at least is good if you get like you know and and so
[00:45:54.120 --> 00:45:56.520]   You have a lot of horsepower
[00:45:56.520 --> 00:45:57.960]   That's actually I'm so upset
[00:45:57.960 --> 00:46:04.320]   I'm so upset too because I've been saying all along that I've got like a thousand dollars fifteen hundred dollars taped to the underside of my desk waiting for
[00:46:04.320 --> 00:46:10.080]   The first really good also looking Mac mini, but I needed that to happen like
[00:46:10.080 --> 00:46:15.520]   September October November when I feel like when I feel like I'm flush with cash
[00:46:15.520 --> 00:46:19.920]   I can spend with I want to have the fact that it happens in January, which is when like I'm doing my job
[00:46:19.920 --> 00:46:24.960]   My budgeting for the rest of the year. I'm thinking that I'm probably gonna be homeless within the next three weeks
[00:46:24.960 --> 00:46:29.200]   This is a good time to spend a thousand dollars on a new Mac the old one works just fine like
[00:46:29.200 --> 00:46:35.440]   I should be by I should be pre-ordering this right now. This is exactly what I've been waiting for. Yeah, okay
[00:46:35.440 --> 00:46:41.080]   Go for it. I want a watch I've heard that from a lot of people. I think it's a little maybe Leo continue that M2
[00:46:41.080 --> 00:46:43.080]   I'm ordered as well
[00:46:43.400 --> 00:46:48.040]   It's I've heard a lot of people who've been really waiting for this because I do believe that a high-end model
[00:46:48.040 --> 00:46:54.440]   Is what a lot of people have been keeping their eyes on and the M1 version of the mini was just a little too limited
[00:46:54.440 --> 00:46:59.080]   Yeah, and so that that higher end model being there and also let's just appreciate
[00:46:59.080 --> 00:47:01.840]   I know that Apple's never gonna be the low price leader
[00:47:01.840 --> 00:47:06.360]   But there was a time when you could not buy a Mac for 599 and
[00:47:06.800 --> 00:47:14.000]   For 599 to get what that M2 mini has in it. Well, it's it's more power than almost anybody like that
[00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:21.520]   99% of users will ever need yeah, and I the sweet spot for me is is another hundred dollars over that 599 is the
[00:47:21.520 --> 00:47:28.560]   16 gigs so now you have so you can get for six nine or seven ninety nine you can get a 16 gig Mac mini M2 and
[00:47:28.560 --> 00:47:31.240]   To me, that's the sweet spot of where I'm buying them right now
[00:47:31.240 --> 00:47:34.400]   I'm gonna buy a couple again
[00:47:34.400 --> 00:47:39.680]   I'm super super pleased that they have a really really cheap a very very competitive wind with windows machines
[00:47:39.680 --> 00:47:42.880]   Macintosh out there because
[00:47:42.880 --> 00:47:47.800]   This 2023 people probably already have a screen that can plug into it
[00:47:47.800 --> 00:47:54.160]   They probably already have a keyboard and a mouse if not it'll cost them what 50 bucks for the pair for not even the worst one at Amazon
[00:47:54.160 --> 00:47:59.520]   Apple really needs to make sure they're still saying that hey look maxa for everybody is not just for
[00:47:59.520 --> 00:48:03.100]   People who can afford to have to pay extra for the logo
[00:48:03.940 --> 00:48:11.280]   Well, and the way the video that they showed or released this morning was tuned it was really for creative
[00:48:11.280 --> 00:48:15.220]   Professionals that's what they that's where they're really you know hey minutes, right?
[00:48:15.220 --> 00:48:18.240]   You're the one who's gonna do this
[00:48:18.240 --> 00:48:24.500]   Yeah, and what's this gonna do to the max studio because I feel like I'm I'm part of a really large group that really
[00:48:24.500 --> 00:48:29.800]   Lusted after the max studio, but even then since that this is more club than I actually need for what I do
[00:48:29.800 --> 00:48:32.160]   I bet that there's going to be I'm gonna get better
[00:48:32.860 --> 00:48:38.860]   a bang for the buck with a Mac mini that I where I can spend all that I can spend the same amount of money to get extra storage and
[00:48:38.860 --> 00:48:46.500]   Extra ram rather than extra CPU that requires these double hat these double height muffin fans that aren't gonna really help me out
[00:48:46.500 --> 00:48:50.020]   I think I think it's a challenge right. I'm ready. Yeah
[00:48:50.020 --> 00:48:54.500]   Top it's only the muffin top I haven't had I haven't had lunch yet
[00:48:54.500 --> 00:49:01.020]   I'm sorry I think the studio like the there's a real question about the studio because does the existence of a Mac Pro?
[00:49:01.700 --> 00:49:09.220]   Down the road mean that the studio doesn't need to exist or is the studio really thought of as being that kind of higher higher end Mac mini
[00:49:09.220 --> 00:49:11.420]   So that they because like I said
[00:49:11.420 --> 00:49:14.220]   Performance wise and price wise it kind of works
[00:49:14.220 --> 00:49:16.780]   But the question is in the long run
[00:49:16.780 --> 00:49:19.100]   Do they really would they really want the Mac Pro?
[00:49:19.100 --> 00:49:25.340]   But to Alex's point the Mac Pro is gonna be so expensive. I think a lot of high-end professionals the Mac studio would be enough
[00:49:25.340 --> 00:49:26.380]   But I do yeah
[00:49:26.380 --> 00:49:33.220]   I do wonder if it's gonna be like the iMac Pro and be kind of a one-off and that in the end the strategy is gonna be Mac
[00:49:33.220 --> 00:49:39.420]   Mini and Mac Pro and not next to you. I hope not though. I like the Mac studio. I think it's just a little bit of overlap
[00:49:39.420 --> 00:49:41.400]   I love it and I yeah, I know you know
[00:49:41.400 --> 00:49:45.580]   You know you make a six colors chart that shows the linearity of the product line
[00:49:45.580 --> 00:49:49.980]   All right, you got it because that's kind of where you what you want to see where there and if there's overlap
[00:49:49.980 --> 00:49:56.140]   That's I'm sure there's somebody inside Apple who's done that and then that's those are the first are risk right go
[00:49:56.140 --> 00:49:59.020]   I'm sorry, I think that I think that there's if you look at the Mac mini
[00:49:59.020 --> 00:50:04.580]   I think it you know it tops out about forty five hundred dollars the studio starts at about three thousand dollars
[00:50:04.580 --> 00:50:06.780]   Little maybe a little bit lower than that
[00:50:06.780 --> 00:50:12.340]   So there's like a fifteen hundred a two thousand dollar overlap if you take the studio and go up and then go backwards two or three thousand dollars
[00:50:12.340 --> 00:50:15.620]   You end up at about eight or nine thousand for the Mac Pro and then up
[00:50:15.620 --> 00:50:18.660]   And and maybe there's a little bit more overlap there
[00:50:18.660 --> 00:50:23.300]   But I still feel like they all solve different problems and the Mac Pro is gonna be probably considerably bigger
[00:50:23.780 --> 00:50:29.620]   It is you know, it's and and I I don't it'll be interesting to see like if you decked out a Mac mini
[00:50:29.620 --> 00:50:34.220]   It'll be interesting to see because of heat whether it slows down, you know the Mac mini
[00:50:34.220 --> 00:50:38.660]   I don't know, you know, I think that the studio obviously, you know half the studio is a big fan
[00:50:38.660 --> 00:50:45.460]   There's a it's there for a reason, you know, so and so I think that we may find that the Mac mini can't sustain long renders
[00:50:45.460 --> 00:50:49.380]   You know long calculations it in a short-term thing
[00:50:49.380 --> 00:50:55.860]   It's fine, but I do things all with my Mac studio that take a solid four or five hours for it to do its work
[00:50:55.860 --> 00:50:59.660]   You know, and so so it I don't think that the Mac mini will sustain
[00:50:59.660 --> 00:51:06.500]   Sustain the speed that the Mac studio will on longer render because you know, I'm cooling that Mac mini that Mac studio
[00:51:06.500 --> 00:51:09.260]   Half of it is cooling
[00:51:09.260 --> 00:51:14.220]   Yeah, so I think they're not gonna be that many I think we'll just see an M2 Mac studio
[00:51:14.220 --> 00:51:16.460]   And it's gonna be a lot faster and it's gonna be but it's gonna
[00:51:16.460 --> 00:51:19.460]   I think the heat dissipation there's more I owe in the studio
[00:51:19.460 --> 00:51:24.620]   I'm using every single output of my Mac studio and now I have to figure out breakouts and everything else for it because
[00:51:24.620 --> 00:51:31.860]   You know, I've got all kinds of stuff going into it and so it's it is not a I don't think that I think the Mac studio is
[00:51:31.860 --> 00:51:38.820]   Well-placed I think that the Mac mini is well-placed the odd the odd computer out is the iMac, you know, like I just that's the part
[00:51:38.820 --> 00:51:40.340]   I don't get the Mac studio also
[00:51:40.340 --> 00:51:43.100]   I mean you could view it as being essentially a Mac Pro and
[00:51:43.820 --> 00:51:48.460]   Maybe even have like the Mac Pro would be the ultra the Mac studio has an ultra config
[00:51:48.460 --> 00:51:52.100]   The difference is the Mac Pro has the huge case and you're gonna be able to do
[00:51:52.100 --> 00:51:58.980]   Expansion of some kind or other on it and for people who want that it'll be there, but that Mac studio does fulfill
[00:51:58.980 --> 00:52:05.660]   People who just want the you know the power, but they don't need that huge extent expansion in the giant box in their house. Yeah
[00:52:05.660 --> 00:52:10.780]   I apologize I think I got it wrong. I'm looking at the
[00:52:11.540 --> 00:52:13.540]   What do you call these the product quilt?
[00:52:13.540 --> 00:52:17.300]   Andy invented this term feature quilt. I love this feature quilt
[00:52:17.300 --> 00:52:22.420]   I'm looking at the feature quilt for the big laptop. It does go up to four external displays
[00:52:22.420 --> 00:52:29.300]   Including 8k with HDMI. So I think I must have been looking at this product spec for the M2 Pro
[00:52:29.300 --> 00:52:31.500]   So if you get a max
[00:52:31.500 --> 00:52:37.900]   Four displays for externals externals five total with the laptop display. That's pretty sweet
[00:52:38.300 --> 00:52:44.580]   For somebody the day trader to be a lot of us have been especially folks that are doing a lot of folks in office hours
[00:52:44.580 --> 00:52:50.460]   Of course, we're doing a lot of zoom ISO zoom stuff that that you they don't necessarily want to get the whole breakout
[00:52:50.460 --> 00:52:52.780]   But it's been a real problem that the Mac mini can only do two
[00:52:52.780 --> 00:53:00.180]   Two videos out so having four out means that you can now pay potentially four participants out and do that of course
[00:53:00.180 --> 00:53:06.020]   I'm using three monitor out of my studio right now and yeah, so it's it's useful
[00:53:06.020 --> 00:53:09.940]   Can I
[00:53:09.940 --> 00:53:16.180]   Yes, actually Mark has brownly just did something that I feel is that I feel is
[00:53:16.180 --> 00:53:21.460]   Is probably the quote of the week. He says fun fact if you plug in a four-year-old
[00:53:21.460 --> 00:53:28.500]   $50,000 plus Matt Pro into Apple's trade-in site. You don't even get enough credit to buy it iPhone 14 pro
[00:53:28.500 --> 00:53:32.660]   Shocks
[00:53:33.020 --> 00:53:35.020]   $70 in trade-in value. Oh
[00:53:35.020 --> 00:53:38.620]   So who
[00:53:38.620 --> 00:53:47.000]   How do we sort this out I mean this is of course what a normal person is asking is which one?
[00:53:47.000 --> 00:53:50.700]   Do I need I know which one I want?
[00:53:50.700 --> 00:53:53.980]   Which can I afford and how much is enough?
[00:53:53.980 --> 00:53:57.460]   How do we decide all that I
[00:53:57.460 --> 00:54:00.380]   Think you need to decide what you know
[00:54:00.380 --> 00:54:05.420]   What what are you really gonna do with it? Like I'm gonna get the 599 for my parents in law because they I
[00:54:05.420 --> 00:54:07.660]   That'll do more than they can imagine
[00:54:07.660 --> 00:54:11.060]   Yeah, you know what what they're gonna do with their Mac they mostly word processing
[00:54:11.060 --> 00:54:16.820]   So it's really inexpensive. I'm gonna probably get a couple of the 699 or 799
[00:54:16.820 --> 00:54:19.820]   I'm gonna put up 16 gigs in and get it for my kids
[00:54:19.820 --> 00:54:23.340]   So they you know I was looking at laptops and I was like oh
[00:54:23.340 --> 00:54:29.180]   You know I just feel like it was gonna add it was starting to add up pretty quickly to a real number and and so this is gonna be
[00:54:29.180 --> 00:54:31.180]   Well, that's Apple isn't it?
[00:54:31.180 --> 00:54:33.860]   It has some good. Well, but it was yes
[00:54:33.860 --> 00:54:38.100]   It does I mean that's laptops and I'm doing I just feel like there's a laptop tax
[00:54:38.100 --> 00:54:45.940]   Which is that you're paying for the chicness and the compact ability and the monitor and everything else and and as someone who now
[00:54:45.940 --> 00:54:47.940]   Doesn't really use a laptop at all
[00:54:47.940 --> 00:54:51.740]   You know I have a lot of unusual charged the world has moved to laptops
[00:54:51.740 --> 00:54:57.140]   Desktop well it depends on how much you know in the world of I working remotely
[00:54:57.140 --> 00:55:00.820]   How much do you use your laptop is the big question and whether your iPad can take over?
[00:55:00.820 --> 00:55:07.060]   I mean I still carry my laptop when I travel but I almost never open it up, you know and so the
[00:55:07.060 --> 00:55:11.300]   What are you doing instead you have a iPad or what do you buy an iPad?
[00:55:11.300 --> 00:55:16.660]   Yeah, but I'm just so I I have the it's funny when I travel I take the old my older iPad
[00:55:16.660 --> 00:55:19.260]   I put that paper surface on it. Yeah, I love drawing on it
[00:55:19.260 --> 00:55:21.900]   I did that too and I thank you for that so pleasurable
[00:55:21.900 --> 00:55:23.300]   Yeah, but I don't want it
[00:55:23.300 --> 00:55:26.700]   I don't want to put it on my newest one because I want the I look at it for color
[00:55:26.700 --> 00:55:31.460]   But but the older one I carry well, that's why you need multiple iPads
[00:55:31.460 --> 00:55:34.060]   Check it which I have
[00:55:34.060 --> 00:55:37.220]   lots of them so the but the but I think that the
[00:55:37.220 --> 00:55:41.860]   I think the higher-end one I think that especially if you start wanting to do hard work
[00:55:41.860 --> 00:55:48.140]   You're not ready to buy a Mac studio. I think you know getting the pro getting a little bit of extra RAM
[00:55:48.900 --> 00:55:53.860]   You know again for the folks that are in office hours the idea of having four outputs is a big deal
[00:55:53.860 --> 00:55:57.340]   So there's a lot of things there that the start to you know
[00:55:57.340 --> 00:56:01.460]   I think you just have to really look at what are you using if you're gonna be an I still think if you're an editor
[00:56:01.460 --> 00:56:05.020]   Like you're doing lots of final cut or resolve you can do it on that
[00:56:05.020 --> 00:56:07.860]   You could definitely do it on the smaller ones you might have a junior editor working on this
[00:56:07.860 --> 00:56:11.660]   But if you're really getting paid for your time, you're still gonna get a studio
[00:56:11.660 --> 00:56:17.460]   You know like I don't think that that's I don't think this solution what I do think is interesting about it is as render nodes
[00:56:17.460 --> 00:56:21.020]   so a lot of us have you know we have extra computers that we're sending out renders to and
[00:56:21.020 --> 00:56:26.140]   You know I'm I'm interested in taking like three or four of these and sending out renders from cinema 40
[00:56:26.140 --> 00:56:30.660]   And just like you know if you don't run out of RAM you can just send these out and they're incredibly powerful little
[00:56:30.660 --> 00:56:33.620]   nodes to send out but again those would you want
[00:56:33.620 --> 00:56:39.500]   More processor more RAM so you might get the higher-end version of the of the of the Mac mini
[00:56:39.500 --> 00:56:46.260]   As usual ask yourself, but can't you do with your car and hardware and that'll that'll lead the way. Oh, that's the terrible way
[00:56:46.980 --> 00:56:48.980]   I could do everything
[00:56:48.980 --> 00:57:02.980]   There's no reason to upgrade that there's nothing at no point do I ever say oh boy, I wish this were faster
[00:57:02.980 --> 00:57:05.660]   Yeah, no, but for me. It's like I
[00:57:05.660 --> 00:57:08.860]   Need I want three displays on my desktop
[00:57:08.860 --> 00:57:14.180]   I want to be able to be able to stream 4k without any problems whatsoever at least and also for the next three or four
[00:57:14.180 --> 00:57:19.120]   Five years and then after that it'll just come down to Gia would be nice to have extra RAM G
[00:57:19.120 --> 00:57:20.220]   It would be nice to have extra storage
[00:57:20.220 --> 00:57:24.960]   But those are those are my reasons for wanting like this new Mac mini and yeah
[00:57:24.960 --> 00:57:29.360]   You can really get you can really get yourself into such a trap by thinking that I will the Mac studio
[00:57:29.360 --> 00:57:31.820]   That'll do exactly what I want or hey actually wait for the Mac Pro
[00:57:31.820 --> 00:57:35.460]   That'll do exactly what I want actually also the 16-ish Macbook Pro like yeah
[00:57:35.460 --> 00:57:40.500]   Not not as a freelance journalist that abruptly collapsing market Andy with chat GPT taking jobs away from you
[00:57:40.500 --> 00:57:45.340]   You should probably think about how much before you work you can move on to a Raspberry Pi. Yeah, I
[00:57:45.340 --> 00:57:48.900]   Mean let's be honest a lot of this is lust
[00:57:48.900 --> 00:57:52.760]   Not not rational thinking
[00:57:52.760 --> 00:57:55.500]   Apple's most successful product
[00:57:55.500 --> 00:57:58.220]   generator hardware lust yeah
[00:57:58.220 --> 00:58:04.060]   And I understand that and I don't know if it's my job to talk you off the ledge, but
[00:58:04.060 --> 00:58:08.620]   Most of us have had more than enough power for years
[00:58:09.580 --> 00:58:15.300]   Yeah, I mean that's that's like the reason you get a Macbook Pro. I would argue is not a
[00:58:15.300 --> 00:58:19.060]   Processor although the processor is gonna do more than the Macbook Air
[00:58:19.060 --> 00:58:26.220]   It's that that screen is amazing right that that the the the LED backlit display
[00:58:26.220 --> 00:58:32.020]   It with high dynamic rain support is beautiful and it comes in 14 and 16. Those are bigger screen sizes
[00:58:32.020 --> 00:58:36.580]   Then you're gonna get on the Macbook Air. It's got more ports, right? It's got more support for better
[00:58:38.100 --> 00:58:41.500]   As a photographer. Yeah, that was a nice thing
[00:58:41.500 --> 00:58:46.060]   I I I in my head think I should have an HDMI port, but I have absolutely no use
[00:58:46.060 --> 00:58:53.180]   Although I will say if all you need is an SD card reader you probably shouldn't upgrade from an air to a pro just for a card reader
[00:58:53.180 --> 00:58:54.340]   I can sell you yeah
[00:58:54.340 --> 00:59:00.300]   I can sell you a USB card reader for that but like it's just funny that Apple's gotten to this point which as impressive as these
[00:59:00.300 --> 00:59:06.980]   Processors are I think the truth is that the greatest appeal that the Macbook Pro has over the Macbook Air
[00:59:07.420 --> 00:59:14.060]   Is in the other stuff it is in battery and screen and ports and that's that's the stuff where it wins the day
[00:59:14.060 --> 00:59:15.900]   for a
[00:59:15.900 --> 00:59:20.820]   Sizable price premium that a lot of people are willing to pay and I think that's not unreasonable
[00:59:20.820 --> 00:59:24.580]   Personally I chose the air because I thought you know
[00:59:24.580 --> 00:59:26.380]   This is this is way more than I need years
[00:59:26.380 --> 00:59:30.260]   I totally understand the pro and if you've got an M1 pro
[00:59:30.260 --> 00:59:34.340]   I don't really see the need to go to the M2 pro all it is is incrementally faster
[00:59:34.340 --> 00:59:40.540]   And that's probably not speed you're using and if you are using that speed and need more of it like Alex probably
[00:59:40.540 --> 00:59:46.140]   You already know well and and for what I was gonna do what I'm I was about to buy more Mac minis for I
[00:59:46.140 --> 00:59:50.860]   Could do them on the M1 just fine. I'm just glad that there's an M2 that I can do it too
[00:59:50.860 --> 00:59:55.300]   You know so it's it and I think that it is a turnover for I think if you bought the M1
[00:59:55.300 --> 00:59:59.780]   I wouldn't worry about it if you have entails though. This is a big you know
[00:59:59.780 --> 01:00:03.820]   It just oh this is the time there's no reason to be on an a Mac in tell Mac at this point
[01:00:03.820 --> 01:00:08.940]   Biggest biggest audience for these products. I think really is all the people who said
[01:00:08.940 --> 01:00:12.820]   I'm gonna wait for the second generation right?
[01:00:12.820 --> 01:00:17.860]   I don't trust the first generation of the chip transition and I mean the shit that's it's gone great
[01:00:17.860 --> 01:00:21.140]   You you kind of missed out, but if you were careful and waited
[01:00:21.140 --> 01:00:29.180]   Now is a great time. I have an idea for a new ad campaign for Apple. I just want I'll give this to you for free Tim
[01:00:29.180 --> 01:00:32.260]   Macos
[01:00:32.260 --> 01:00:34.260]   Makers
[01:00:34.260 --> 01:00:37.820]   Macos the Mac of fate
[01:00:37.820 --> 01:00:42.900]   Nus the maker. I don't know. I just it just hit me too bad. I'm a car
[01:00:42.900 --> 01:00:48.060]   We're kind of multibon is no longer with a fine. You can really go in fine current the software
[01:00:48.060 --> 01:00:51.980]   Silicon
[01:00:51.980 --> 01:00:56.540]   Somebody in the chat room is asking Alex Lindsay. What's the name of that paper thing you put on your?
[01:00:56.540 --> 01:00:59.380]   I pay was
[01:00:59.380 --> 01:01:02.140]   We know it's it's a pick a committed a pick it was a pick
[01:01:02.140 --> 01:01:07.900]   So if you go to Mac break picks yeah MBW pick so whatever you'll find it. I don't know what I had to look at it
[01:01:07.900 --> 01:01:08.780]   I'm on it for Amazon
[01:01:08.780 --> 01:01:12.700]   Yeah, there's two on Amazon and I bought both and then saying my orders right now
[01:01:12.700 --> 01:01:16.900]   I wanted to see if there was a difference and there isn't so it doesn't matter which one you get I
[01:01:16.900 --> 01:01:23.260]   Did find the application was good. My big thing is like how hard is it to put on and it did a pretty
[01:01:23.260 --> 01:01:25.900]   good job of
[01:01:26.980 --> 01:01:29.700]   I got the paper feel paper feel
[01:01:29.700 --> 01:01:32.460]   screen protector
[01:01:32.460 --> 01:01:34.460]   compatible guy pet
[01:01:34.460 --> 01:01:36.460]   and the paper like and
[01:01:36.460 --> 01:01:41.860]   I can't remember what you want I'm using it'll set you back seven dollars and 91 yes
[01:01:41.860 --> 01:01:48.740]   Yeah, paper feel or paper like either way I have the paper. Yeah, they're very they're highly competitive
[01:01:48.740 --> 01:01:51.820]   I ordered them both because they were so cheap. Yeah, and
[01:01:51.820 --> 01:01:56.580]   Yeah, you get it by the screen size and all that you know I draw all my
[01:01:56.580 --> 01:01:59.260]   Key I talked about this before I draw my keynotes, you know
[01:01:59.260 --> 01:02:06.020]   I I I sketched them all out every slide before I start working on them to save time actually get the paper feel is it is cheaper and
[01:02:06.020 --> 01:02:10.140]   And I just felt it just makes it so much more pleasurable like I don't know what it is
[01:02:10.140 --> 01:02:13.780]   It's just there's something about the the drag there that makes it just feel like you're right now
[01:02:13.780 --> 01:02:18.620]   But you said that it doesn't the color is not quite as it's like it. It's like it's yeah
[01:02:18.620 --> 01:02:23.460]   Yeah, so it's it's it's Matt and and I part of what I use my iPad for is to see what color
[01:02:23.460 --> 01:02:26.420]   I'm actually creating when I don't have a color correct monitor
[01:02:26.420 --> 01:02:30.260]   And so so I need that one to be like I need the blacks to be really black black
[01:02:30.260 --> 01:02:33.340]   You know in the and the whites to be what they need and so sides
[01:02:33.340 --> 01:02:39.660]   So my newer one I keep I keep clean. I don't have the brand new one because I was like I got already got two pros
[01:02:39.660 --> 01:02:42.460]   They're both the same material. It's pet. It's polyethylene
[01:02:42.460 --> 01:02:45.220]   Tera salate
[01:02:45.220 --> 01:02:52.820]   So yeah, but get you know what why get the $39 one when you get the not to $10 one it seems to me
[01:02:53.820 --> 01:03:00.660]   Pretty clear work great. Yeah, I did buy both because I think I wanted to be able to tell people which and then I promptly forgot
[01:03:00.660 --> 01:03:04.360]   So get the ten though. I don't think there was a difference as I remember
[01:03:04.360 --> 01:03:10.300]   Good now, let's take a break because I'll tell you about something I like
[01:03:10.300 --> 01:03:16.340]   More to come with Mac break weekly, but I want to talk about my very good night sleep ahead last night actually this morning
[01:03:16.340 --> 01:03:21.900]   Was funny. It was really we had a I guess we had a frost overnight Jason. It was really really really really cold
[01:03:22.540 --> 01:03:28.220]   And I like to have sleep with the windows open and Lisa got up. I got up at
[01:03:28.220 --> 01:03:30.900]   630 Lisa got up and then
[01:03:30.900 --> 01:03:34.980]   Immediately went back to bed and turned our eight sleep up to ten
[01:03:34.980 --> 01:03:38.140]   And texted me coffee, please
[01:03:38.140 --> 01:03:43.380]   She said I went in I brought her coffee and she said I was just too cold
[01:03:43.380 --> 01:03:48.380]   I had to get back in but that's the beauty of the eight sleep you would never know it we have this amazing
[01:03:48.820 --> 01:03:53.740]   eight sleep pod cover now you can eat sleep you can go with a mattress they make them but
[01:03:53.740 --> 01:03:59.780]   We just have the cover because we like our mattress put the cover over it's like a mattress pad, but it does something very special
[01:03:59.780 --> 01:04:04.260]   It features the pod cover features a dual zone temperature control
[01:04:04.260 --> 01:04:08.380]   So you have different each of you have different settings
[01:04:08.380 --> 01:04:14.820]   You could set each side of the bed to as cool as 55 degrees and by the way, that's chilly
[01:04:15.380 --> 01:04:22.860]   In a hot summer night 55 degrees you got air conditioning in your bed or as hot as 110 degrees and by the way
[01:04:22.860 --> 01:04:27.260]   That's toasty roasty on a cold winter's night. You're gonna love it
[01:04:27.260 --> 01:04:32.500]   But it goes another step farther because this is a smart device
[01:04:32.500 --> 01:04:34.900]   it has a
[01:04:34.900 --> 01:04:43.980]   It has sensors built into it based on your biometrics the temperature in your room and your sleep stage the pod cover
[01:04:43.980 --> 01:04:52.660]   adjusts the temperature throughout the night to reduce the number of wake-ups to increase your deep sleep and deep sleep is the key to
[01:04:52.660 --> 01:04:55.100]   everything
[01:04:55.100 --> 01:05:01.100]   Consistent good sleep can reduce the likelihood of serious health issues decrease the risk of heart disease lower your blood pressure
[01:05:01.100 --> 01:05:04.420]   There's even studies to say it reduces the risk of Alzheimer's
[01:05:04.420 --> 01:05:13.380]   If you're struggling to fall asleep if you wake up in the middle of the night if you're fighting with your partner over the thermostat
[01:05:13.980 --> 01:05:16.300]   You need the eight sleep pod cover
[01:05:16.300 --> 01:05:21.260]   It's amazing. Listen. I have completely different settings. She likes it really hot
[01:05:21.260 --> 01:05:26.180]   I like to get in the bed and it's cozy. It's warm not hot, but just kind of well, that's comfy
[01:05:26.180 --> 01:05:31.180]   But then what happens is and I said it initially and then the sleep doctor kind of watches and
[01:05:31.180 --> 01:05:38.740]   Adjust it is it gets cooler once you're in a deep sleep because it senses that and it gets cooler and it actually cools you down
[01:05:38.740 --> 01:05:43.180]   If I if I were to wake up in the middle of that deep sleep, I would say it's cool
[01:05:43.180 --> 01:05:49.980]   Because it turns out biologically. I don't know why there's some sort of reason, but I'm I'm not clear what it is
[01:05:49.980 --> 01:05:53.820]   But you do go deeper into your deep sleep as it cools off
[01:05:53.820 --> 01:05:55.740]   I think because we grew up, you know
[01:05:55.740 --> 01:06:01.660]   We evolved in an environment where you might you know put out the fire at night getting bed and then it gets cool overnight, right?
[01:06:01.660 --> 01:06:04.300]   The but I have to say we're not savages
[01:06:04.500 --> 01:06:11.020]   So we're not animals so so when when you when you got to get up the the sleep kind of goes
[01:06:11.020 --> 01:06:15.220]   Okay, and I have it set for like an alarm. It gets a little warmer and you kind of go
[01:06:15.220 --> 01:06:19.380]   Gosh, that feels good. Maybe you don't want to get out of bed though. So don't get too warm
[01:06:19.380 --> 01:06:21.580]   Lisa did not want to get a bed this morning
[01:06:21.580 --> 01:06:26.140]   It's the best in class temperature regulation and a sensor to track your healthier sleep metrics
[01:06:26.140 --> 01:06:32.140]   There you don't have to wear any wearable devices. You will know how much sleep deep sleep you got how much REM sleep you got
[01:06:32.300 --> 01:06:38.460]   How long it took you to go to sleep and I tell you what even if you're in Australia in the summer and it's hot this summer
[01:06:38.460 --> 01:06:43.340]   You're gonna love the eight sleeps cooling and if you're in the northern hemisphere and it's cold because of winter
[01:06:43.340 --> 01:06:46.100]   You're gonna love the warmth and that's the beauty of it. It does both
[01:06:46.100 --> 01:06:53.300]   Better sleep. It's a health habit. You'll love sticking to night after night wake up fully energized with the pod cover
[01:06:53.300 --> 01:06:57.780]   So you could tackle whatever life throws at you ate sleep EIGHT
[01:06:58.460 --> 01:07:03.740]   SL EEP calm slash twit you'll save $150 on the pod cover
[01:07:03.740 --> 01:07:07.900]   We've had ours for a year now more than a year. This is our second winter with it
[01:07:07.900 --> 01:07:10.900]   I just love it and it when it was really hot this summer man
[01:07:10.900 --> 01:07:14.140]   I felt great it saves you money in the longer because you don't have to heat the house
[01:07:14.140 --> 01:07:22.100]   You don't have to cool the house just cool the bed eight sleep currently ships in the US. Yes, but also Canada the UK
[01:07:22.100 --> 01:07:25.300]   So like countries in the EU and Australia
[01:07:26.420 --> 01:07:32.100]   Eight sleep calm slash twit. Thank you ate sleep. Thank you. We bought our eight sleep
[01:07:32.100 --> 01:07:38.340]   More before they were sponsored because Kevin Rose told me about it the name he web said yeah, it's really great
[01:07:38.340 --> 01:07:44.660]   So we bought it and that's the one where I put it on wrong. They have very good videos that explained to you. I think
[01:07:44.660 --> 01:07:52.340]   It's not hard. I just I'm you know, I'm not gonna read the manual. I can do this. It's obvious
[01:07:52.340 --> 01:07:56.580]   No, well, I watched the swatch a little video and you go. Yeah, it is obvious
[01:07:56.580 --> 01:08:00.820]   But not like Leo thought and I had to take it off put it back on again
[01:08:00.820 --> 01:08:07.380]   But now I love it. I love it in fact that we they did just send us the new pod three and I haven't changed it because I'm just so happy
[01:08:07.380 --> 01:08:13.860]   I just but eventually I'm gonna I'm gonna put on the new one. I'll tell you how the new one works eight sleep calm
[01:08:13.860 --> 01:08:16.020]   slash
[01:08:16.020 --> 01:08:21.100]   Twit I think it just I saw some eight and eight sleep in the office. I think it just got his
[01:08:21.100 --> 01:08:27.220]   All right, anything more to say about the surprise announcement this morning
[01:08:27.220 --> 01:08:32.020]   What did you order Jason? Oh, you didn't you're gonna get say review units
[01:08:32.020 --> 01:08:34.820]   Yeah, I mean, I'm gonna review
[01:08:34.820 --> 01:08:37.340]   some of this I
[01:08:37.340 --> 01:08:43.860]   Might be in a market for a Mac mini. I have a Mac mini server in my house. It's an Intel i3. Oh, yeah, I'm
[01:08:43.860 --> 01:08:46.860]   judgmentally as we speak
[01:08:46.860 --> 01:08:48.180]   but
[01:08:48.180 --> 01:08:53.020]   Whether I need more there. I think the biggest win there might be that'll use a lot less power
[01:08:53.020 --> 01:08:57.780]   Right, I've got running 24 7 but but your new dog's not gonna like it because it's not as warm
[01:08:57.780 --> 01:09:04.060]   Yeah, but it's up in it's up like on the shelf in a closet where the it does not affect see that's why we have cats
[01:09:04.060 --> 01:09:06.060]   They find the warmth no matter where it is
[01:09:06.060 --> 01:09:11.220]   Our cats haven't found it either like it's wait. It's too. It's way too high up. They they can't get there
[01:09:11.220 --> 01:09:14.820]   Oh, you can borrow ours if you really want to see it. Oh great work to find heat. I
[01:09:14.820 --> 01:09:17.900]   Guess we'll be buying a Mac mini John. Go ahead
[01:09:18.780 --> 01:09:21.180]   Lisa is funny because Lisa two days ago
[01:09:21.180 --> 01:09:27.540]   Her M1 MacBook Air the keyboards been getting flaky after I had a bunch
[01:09:27.540 --> 01:09:30.620]   I blew it out and a bunch of stuff and I said you're gonna have to bring it into Apple have
[01:09:30.620 --> 01:09:36.060]   Replace it and that was all it took. She said well is I'll get a new M2 like you have and
[01:09:36.060 --> 01:09:43.340]   Then the next day Apple surprised us. So I think she's gonna get the I think we're gonna end up getting a 14 inch
[01:09:43.340 --> 01:09:46.340]   For Lisa and she always wants the most power
[01:09:46.340 --> 01:09:56.660]   She has no use for it, but don't forget Mac OS they lust pivot pivot tables pivot tables, you know
[01:09:56.660 --> 01:10:02.100]   She does do a lot of it. Yeah, see I but I would never use a 14 inch with spreadsheet unless you have a monitor
[01:10:02.100 --> 01:10:09.140]   Because she has yeah, so I don't know what she wants a laptop. She has not she has those 49 inch monitors
[01:10:09.140 --> 01:10:12.300]   She's got they're all over the place. Anyway, what are you getting Alex?
[01:10:12.300 --> 01:10:15.420]   What you
[01:10:15.700 --> 01:10:23.060]   Yeah, I have an order of you because I've been in meetings all morning, but but I'm gonna the I'm gonna get probably two of the
[01:10:23.060 --> 01:10:25.380]   16 gigs for myself
[01:10:25.380 --> 01:10:30.620]   I'm building this kind of system at home where I can do editing and stuff like that and not editing but like
[01:10:30.620 --> 01:10:34.820]   Cutting a bunch of live shows and kind of building this whole thing out. So I need two more
[01:10:34.820 --> 01:10:36.820]   I was gonna get two M1s yesterday
[01:10:36.820 --> 01:10:39.220]   I waited timing was good
[01:10:39.220 --> 01:10:45.340]   Because the problem with Apple the Apple store where I am it's it's faster to order it than to go to the store
[01:10:45.340 --> 01:10:50.920]   You know, so so I almost got him. I literally would have ordered them at three and had them at five
[01:10:50.920 --> 01:10:55.320]   You know from from the Apple store. So so anyway, I'm glad I didn't do that
[01:10:55.320 --> 01:11:01.460]   And so I'm gonna get a couple of them to get one for my again. I'll probably get five or six
[01:11:01.460 --> 01:11:06.540]   Do we care so many the chat rooms saying again?
[01:11:06.540 --> 01:11:10.780]   That's I just want to say that that's like the price of one laptop like one pretty good setup laptop
[01:11:10.780 --> 01:11:18.220]   different computers going six different directions, so it is actually a cost thing for me is that I am now going to buy ones that are
[01:11:18.220 --> 01:11:19.860]   Doing things and buying multiple computers
[01:11:19.860 --> 01:11:25.660]   They're gonna go to multiple people and a lot of other things and I and otherwise I'd be sucking them all up by paying for monitors that I
[01:11:25.660 --> 01:11:30.420]   You know again, I don't I just think laptops are unless you're really traveling
[01:11:30.420 --> 01:11:33.020]   I don't think it makes sense I because even with my Mac studio
[01:11:33.020 --> 01:11:35.180]   I bought a case for it and now I just take it to the office
[01:11:35.180 --> 01:11:38.220]   I don't I don't even like I don't even laptop to go to the office
[01:11:38.220 --> 01:11:41.780]   I just have a monitor and I just go down there and I set it down and plug everything in and
[01:11:41.780 --> 01:11:46.780]   I'm gonna turn the computer off because that comes it actually restores itself better when you don't
[01:11:46.780 --> 01:11:53.340]   Problem somebody the chat rooms complaining that they Apple still doesn't support support display port 2
[01:11:53.340 --> 01:11:58.940]   Which is you know 3x improvement data rate and sports
[01:11:58.940 --> 01:12:02.220]   K video with 60 Hertz and blah blah blah
[01:12:02.780 --> 01:12:09.860]   You don't use it. It's you - my 2.1 is a HDMI 2.1 will do all of us support that right?
[01:12:09.860 --> 01:12:14.120]   Yeah, it's like 8k. Yeah, I think it's an 8. I think it's a 2.1 connection
[01:12:14.120 --> 01:12:17.160]   I believe but I
[01:12:17.160 --> 01:12:19.940]   Haven't I haven't you know, but I'm pretty funny. It's 2.0
[01:12:19.940 --> 01:12:25.700]   Yeah, no, this is the field you work in you don't drive things with your Mac's particularly, right? You just
[01:12:25.700 --> 01:12:28.740]   You
[01:12:28.740 --> 01:12:34.100]   What do you mean by drive thing? Well, I mean like if you wanted 10k you would well, maybe you would would you do it on a Mac?
[01:12:34.100 --> 01:12:38.580]   No, no, you get specialized systems for that and those are often nice PCs
[01:12:38.580 --> 01:12:44.620]   So yeah, so those but you can I mean there if you have multiple monitor outputs
[01:12:44.620 --> 01:12:48.180]   You can use things like resolume and other things that'll blend those all together
[01:12:48.180 --> 01:12:50.180]   So you can definitely do it from a Mac
[01:12:50.180 --> 01:12:56.900]   But but usually you're using when you're really doing like big screens or using things like resolume or disguise or other
[01:12:57.100 --> 01:13:01.060]   You know, there's big big apps that do that do that thing
[01:13:01.060 --> 01:13:05.740]   So it doesn't say I'm looking it must somewhere say what HDMI
[01:13:05.740 --> 01:13:12.280]   Version supports you could probably figure it out from the specs that it says I don't do a lot of I mean
[01:13:12.280 --> 01:13:19.460]   I have to admit that once it's to 4k. I don't really do a lot of monitor work. That's over 4k because it's
[01:13:19.460 --> 01:13:24.660]   To be honest with you my eyesight isn't good enough like it doesn't make any like I'm not gonna see it
[01:13:24.900 --> 01:13:26.900]   In my monitors that I'm working in
[01:13:26.900 --> 01:13:31.080]   If I'm close enough and I have a large enough screen a K might make a difference
[01:13:31.080 --> 01:13:35.980]   But it's got to be like I mean you had remember that you had top a K a K matters when I'm at 85
[01:13:35.980 --> 01:13:38.780]   inches at you know four feet
[01:13:38.780 --> 01:13:46.020]   Or by the way in VR displays because your inches away from it makes a makes a big difference for that
[01:13:46.020 --> 01:13:50.380]   I think that and again, I think that we're gonna see I would be surprised if those if the I
[01:13:52.300 --> 01:13:59.780]   Think we'll see at least 60 60 frame per second 6k from the from the headsets the upper end might be 120 by 8k
[01:13:59.780 --> 01:14:06.540]   Right, right and that so those those kind of resolutions matter then and I do think I a lot of us have noticed that the
[01:14:06.540 --> 01:14:12.100]   Final cut and motion updates were very slow. Not much happen this year
[01:14:12.100 --> 01:14:17.220]   One reason for that would be if you were building a bunch of stuff that can't be released yet
[01:14:17.220 --> 01:14:19.100]   so
[01:14:19.100 --> 01:14:21.860]   With no information I have no literally have no one no one
[01:14:21.860 --> 01:14:30.680]   RC is guessing as I think we are that the M2 change allows in the pros allows HDMI 2.1
[01:14:30.680 --> 01:14:32.860]   You they do promote Wi-Fi I do think so
[01:14:32.860 --> 01:14:36.660]   And that's you know chip based so
[01:14:36.660 --> 01:14:39.540]   Yeah, so I think I think that I think it is 2.1
[01:14:39.540 --> 01:14:42.540]   I think I mean the Apple TV then the newest Apple TV has 2.1
[01:14:42.540 --> 01:14:45.340]   Yeah, and that should be 8k 60
[01:14:45.340 --> 01:14:49.060]   I think pretty I don't think it's 8k 120, but I think it's a k 60 and 4k 120
[01:14:49.060 --> 01:14:56.660]   Yeah, and there are a lot of 4k 120 displays TVs so it makes not a lot of content yet. No, yeah
[01:14:56.660 --> 01:14:59.260]   Unless you're playing video games
[01:14:59.260 --> 01:15:04.460]   Video games you get the 120 but but I think that it's interesting that the phones shoot 120
[01:15:04.460 --> 01:15:12.780]   Andy if you've been budgeting for anything, this is a surprise. I know yeah
[01:15:12.780 --> 01:15:16.180]   I've got the I got the page in front of me so I definitely got to go with
[01:15:16.180 --> 01:15:22.780]   Mac mini with the M2 Pro because I want to I want those three displays in my budget
[01:15:22.780 --> 01:15:28.900]   I'm my budget is roughly more than 1500 but definitely less than 2000 and it's like
[01:15:28.900 --> 01:15:35.020]   I kind of feel like I got to have the 32 gigs of unified memory. So that's another 400 bucks bring me up to
[01:15:35.020 --> 01:15:42.700]   It's like the old wheel of fortune so space so I'm up to 1699 and then we get to the question of do we walk away with $300?
[01:15:42.700 --> 01:15:46.060]   In our pocket or do we say okay? Give me 10 gigabit ethernet?
[01:15:46.060 --> 01:15:51.820]   Give me don't get 10 gigabit ethernet. No, you don't have that anywhere. Where are you gonna use that?
[01:15:51.820 --> 01:15:55.980]   Because I'm hoping to get like five six seven years out of this and it turns out
[01:15:55.980 --> 01:16:03.100]   If in that time I upgrade my my NAS to something with 10 gigs or right other devices with 10 gigs
[01:16:03.100 --> 01:16:04.980]   I'm kind of surprised that at this price point
[01:16:04.980 --> 01:16:08.820]   They don't just don't just give you 10 gigabit ethernet. That's kind of interesting to me
[01:16:08.820 --> 01:16:15.540]   And you're always gonna get at least a terabyte. I wish we we have to get Alan Mavantano or somebody to test and see where the
[01:16:15.540 --> 01:16:20.380]   Jump in performance is we know that the at least on the laptops the slow
[01:16:20.380 --> 01:16:26.580]   512 gig drives slower than the bigger one and you think Alex's maybe two terabytes to the cutoff
[01:16:26.580 --> 01:16:31.860]   I think it's in the last in the past is one terabyte once you got the one terabyte. It was a bigger. It was a faster
[01:16:31.860 --> 01:16:37.640]   That was a big jump. Yeah. Yeah, we might my problem is that like I feel I can justify the idea that hey look
[01:16:37.640 --> 01:16:41.560]   I can always buy like an external drive for extra storage. I'll use 512
[01:16:41.560 --> 01:16:45.820]   I'll use the 512 internal for a lot for the important apps that I got a launch
[01:16:45.820 --> 01:16:49.580]   And if I've got a document that is or video that really is that important?
[01:16:49.580 --> 01:16:51.820]   I'll save partition. I'll save space for that
[01:16:51.820 --> 01:16:56.500]   I can't upgrade memory and there might be a time where I'm gonna wish I had 32 instead of 16
[01:16:56.500 --> 01:17:03.660]   Is there any argument Alex forgetting the 12 core CPU versus the 10 and the 19 core GPU versus 16?
[01:17:03.660 --> 01:17:09.040]   That's a $300 jump and it seems like it can't possibly be that big a jump in performance
[01:17:09.040 --> 01:17:16.880]   Depends on it again. It depends on the application using it depends on how it depends on how optimized that
[01:17:16.880 --> 01:17:24.200]   application is being written to the hardware because that's the big thing that right now is that we're the big performance
[01:17:24.200 --> 01:17:25.960]   stoppage
[01:17:25.960 --> 01:17:31.000]   Is a lot of times the developers not developing especially if they're developing a word processor?
[01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:35.140]   It doesn't really matter, but if they're developing audio video, you know music
[01:17:35.140 --> 01:17:40.340]   Synthesizers that type of thing those kind of processors matter if they're taking advantage of it
[01:17:40.340 --> 01:17:45.380]   And so a lot of those are gonna be what we're gonna see more and more of I think also is less
[01:17:45.380 --> 01:17:50.760]   The ones that are taking the most advantage of it are gonna be either really big development teams or
[01:17:50.760 --> 01:17:53.580]   Mac only teams
[01:17:53.580 --> 01:17:59.540]   To do both directions to the M2 pro on the mini though because you get double the memory bandwidth
[01:17:59.540 --> 01:18:01.540]   Which I imagine makes a difference
[01:18:01.540 --> 01:18:03.880]   Yeah, in performance. Yeah
[01:18:03.880 --> 01:18:07.120]   It's unified memory, so
[01:18:07.120 --> 01:18:11.360]   Are we happy with 16 gigs? Do we want to go to 32 gigs?
[01:18:11.360 --> 01:18:16.320]   Just again, I guess that just depends on your means for this for the little glue ones that I'm getting for my office
[01:18:16.320 --> 01:18:22.600]   I'm just getting the way eight gigs. I don't mean that's always blows me away because eight feels like gosh that seems like 19
[01:18:22.600 --> 01:18:28.520]   Apple Apple themselves Apple himself says that on the on the buying page that if you're
[01:18:28.800 --> 01:18:36.380]   16 is broke for any at least on the M2 pro if you're doing normal normal stuff 16 will do you find 32 gigs is desirable if you're
[01:18:36.380 --> 01:18:38.040]   editing 4k video
[01:18:38.040 --> 01:18:43.400]   Yeah, I'm not editing with the ones I'm getting so it's so it's and we've already tested it like with the zoom stuff
[01:18:43.400 --> 01:18:50.920]   That we do a lot of the eight gigs was just fine. Yeah, and yeah, didn't bother and of course as we've said before you cannot upgrade
[01:18:50.920 --> 01:18:56.200]   Either the memory or the storage on these so get what you need
[01:18:56.780 --> 01:19:00.140]   Because that's what you're gonna have for the life of the machine
[01:19:00.140 --> 01:19:05.600]   You can do external storage, but you can't memories memory. You can be able to do anything and
[01:19:05.600 --> 01:19:11.740]   External storage is not as fast as the internal you said that's really important
[01:19:11.740 --> 01:19:14.820]   I you said it many times Alex, but I really want to reiterate that well that
[01:19:14.820 --> 01:19:21.380]   Thunderbolt 4 your external storage is not as fast as these fastest internal drives
[01:19:21.660 --> 01:19:29.040]   What we don't know is if all of these at every level the Mac minis are what what is the speed of the speed are they?
[01:19:29.040 --> 01:19:32.620]   Yeah, you know, so so on the pro on the pro side of it
[01:19:32.620 --> 01:19:39.060]   I'm gonna bet that that is the same drive speed as we see in the studio in the base units
[01:19:39.060 --> 01:19:44.060]   I would be surprised if it was like I think it'll probably be so I think your external drive would be just as fast
[01:19:44.060 --> 01:19:47.220]   Because I think it just won't have that that's what it was in the level on the
[01:19:48.020 --> 01:19:53.100]   Laptop and there was some there's some planes about that when you got 512 gigs, right? You got a slower SSD
[01:19:53.100 --> 01:19:56.100]   Yeah, so all right
[01:19:56.100 --> 01:19:58.920]   Good buying advice. Thank you
[01:19:58.920 --> 01:20:04.580]   And you know what is great. These are people put their money where their mouth is these are not people who are
[01:20:04.580 --> 01:20:10.260]   You know just saying spend the money spend the money. It's they're putting their own money out too. Yeah
[01:20:10.260 --> 01:20:14.580]   Good Lord. Yes. Good Lord. Am I putting out the money?
[01:20:14.580 --> 01:20:20.500]   But just remember Mac OS the lust maker and and one thing that I am doing because I have a lot of share
[01:20:20.500 --> 01:20:27.380]   Shared libraries over NAS is I'm looking at I'm getting the 10 gig ethernet connection. Yeah, that's what Andy was
[01:20:27.380 --> 01:20:29.940]   I'm not a making a Synology with a 10 GBE
[01:20:29.940 --> 01:20:36.860]   Then you then you don't you know internally of course you'd have to wire your whole house with cat six. Yeah
[01:20:36.860 --> 01:20:44.180]   That's the challenge. I have a giant I have a giant spool over over here for that very reason. It's like eventually
[01:20:44.180 --> 01:20:46.180]   I guess I got to do something with that
[01:20:46.180 --> 01:20:53.180]   I set up a museum where there's a room that every with oversized objects in it
[01:20:53.180 --> 01:20:55.540]   And I say that it's thread because that's what it looks like literally
[01:20:55.540 --> 01:21:02.740]   I gotta find a big needle
[01:21:02.740 --> 01:21:10.100]   I just give it. I'm just gonna put I have to rewire it this year finally and I have why unfortunately
[01:21:10.100 --> 01:21:12.020]   There's one in the house. So just matter of your point
[01:21:12.020 --> 01:21:14.900]   I was like if I'm gonna go through all this trouble and get all that you have conduit air in house
[01:21:14.900 --> 01:21:16.180]   So won't be hard. I
[01:21:16.180 --> 01:21:19.420]   But I'm gonna pull all that stuff through I'm gonna put that 12 in
[01:21:19.420 --> 01:21:23.060]   My house Leo, that's what I have to do
[01:21:23.060 --> 01:21:25.540]   No other method is
[01:21:25.540 --> 01:21:31.140]   Staple it to the staple it and then drag drill a hole and run it run it inside. It's great. Good stuff
[01:21:31.140 --> 01:21:34.020]   I need 50s construction you might as well get that
[01:21:34.020 --> 01:21:40.060]   Ethernet cable with LEDs built in and then you just have permanent Christmas lights. It'd be great. Oh, that's a great idea
[01:21:40.060 --> 01:21:44.860]   I love it. I just made that light. I just made that product up. I don't know if it exists. It should
[01:21:44.860 --> 01:21:49.140]   We're just checking just in now it does exist
[01:21:49.140 --> 01:21:56.340]   I say embrace the ethernet I as well. You talk about the efficiencies of Chinese manufacturing
[01:21:56.340 --> 01:22:00.180]   They pull it even before you had that was quick had a thought and boom
[01:22:00.180 --> 01:22:07.940]   I'm trying after looking we just put remember a couple of years ago. We put in the ethernet everywhere and I hope we put in at least
[01:22:07.940 --> 01:22:13.580]   Cat 6 what do I need for a 10 gigabit cat 6 or e 6 e what do I need?
[01:22:13.580 --> 01:22:16.020]   Well, and I don't know if you need for the whole house
[01:22:16.020 --> 01:22:19.220]   I mean my whole thing is is that I'm gonna probably have a server next to you
[01:22:19.220 --> 01:22:23.740]   So there's no I'll be looking at it next to each other. So I don't have to run it that far
[01:22:23.740 --> 01:22:30.620]   I can't six. I think is what you need for 10 gigs six. Okay, depends on the length. Let's say it's a hundred feet
[01:22:30.620 --> 01:22:33.500]   6 e
[01:22:34.220 --> 01:22:38.540]   I wouldn't put any less than six e but again if you're doing it very long, I'm just gonna put I can't find her
[01:22:38.540 --> 01:22:40.540]   I've got I can't remember what we put in
[01:22:40.540 --> 01:22:48.980]   SFPs. I thought I probably thought to myself. I don't need 10 gigabits. Oh no one would ever need 10 gigabits
[01:22:48.980 --> 01:22:56.980]   It's SFPs. That's all you need how many how many these will find megapixel JPEGs am I gonna be sending from one place to another
[01:22:56.980 --> 01:22:58.980]   For every second exactly exactly
[01:22:59.780 --> 01:23:04.300]   All right, my apple quick take camera only shoots at 121 60 by 120 forever. Thanks
[01:23:04.300 --> 01:23:10.180]   Those are the worst remember how bad that was it maybe was 320 it was 320 by 160
[01:23:10.180 --> 01:23:16.780]   What do you mean by 220 take? Yeah, I had the Panasonic I had the Panasonic kit that came out in
[01:23:16.780 --> 01:23:19.060]   1997 and it was
[01:23:19.060 --> 01:23:23.380]   Like 1600 by 1200. I have a lot of photos that I wish were bigger now. Oh gosh
[01:23:23.380 --> 01:23:26.340]   That wasn't the one you saved a floppy disk was it?
[01:23:26.740 --> 01:23:30.540]   No, no, it had like a I think you just had to plug the camera in
[01:23:30.540 --> 01:23:33.420]   I don't think it had an external way to pull the camera stuff off of it
[01:23:33.420 --> 01:23:36.140]   It was like a it looked like a little spaceship. It was kind of cool
[01:23:36.140 --> 01:23:41.220]   There's a can you have a goal is there really a cat 12 no
[01:23:41.220 --> 01:23:43.940]   There's just called fiber
[01:23:43.940 --> 01:23:51.380]   Cat 12 yes, it's gold. It's made out of my own. I just never want to do it again
[01:23:51.380 --> 01:23:56.420]   So I was like if I just pulled cat 12 right everything that's why you put conduit in because you could you know
[01:23:56.420 --> 01:23:59.540]   It's not caught. I don't have conduit. It's just snaked through someone already did it
[01:23:59.540 --> 01:24:03.380]   So there's I can but the good the good thing is I can now
[01:24:03.380 --> 01:24:08.900]   Attach that to the one that's already there and pull it through. That's the key is that I
[01:24:08.900 --> 01:24:14.300]   And Jason's like no, I can't do that. I mean no you can't that's the it's just he said holes
[01:24:14.300 --> 01:24:17.300]   And I'm like oh so much for conduit isn't it Alex? It's yeah
[01:24:17.300 --> 01:24:23.020]   I don't think I have a hole with a wire and if I take the wires to it I can pull them through and that's basically a conduit
[01:24:23.820 --> 01:24:26.740]   It's close meanwhile. I'll be out of my ladder, you know
[01:24:26.740 --> 01:24:33.020]   We just ran fiber down to the pit and it was like it was nice because we could lift up the
[01:24:33.020 --> 01:24:37.820]   Floor tiles because it's a big production facility, but still when we lifted him up
[01:24:37.820 --> 01:24:39.820]   We were like no one has lifted these up
[01:24:39.820 --> 01:24:48.660]   Explain is a basement sound studio that he does the podcast in another stuff
[01:24:48.660 --> 01:24:52.020]   And it's in the building that used to be
[01:24:53.100 --> 01:24:57.740]   The Lucas island main stage island main stage and and the pit is now
[01:24:57.740 --> 01:25:04.260]   Least by John McDermott who's the guitarist for stroke nine if you remember that band of he had a bunch of
[01:25:04.260 --> 01:25:10.740]   Gold records down there and some guitar. Yes, but but he but the but yes, we were really we've been trying to we've been slowly building it up
[01:25:10.740 --> 01:25:18.180]   But we opened up the the floor and yeah, and it was a lot of a lot of rats have been down there. Oh a random spilled drinks and
[01:25:19.820 --> 01:25:23.620]   No, no paraphernalia, but but we didn't know we thought we might find some
[01:25:23.620 --> 01:25:27.980]   Some kind of bodies down there, but not not human bodies, but just things. I know I'm
[01:25:27.980 --> 01:25:35.460]   If it was a busy musician that with any credibility like you could vacuum and that HEPA filter would probably you could have made enough money
[01:25:35.460 --> 01:25:38.460]   Back to the place the point is once you once you're in the pit
[01:25:38.460 --> 01:25:41.340]   It's it's the cleanest it's ever been you see the pictures in light and magic
[01:25:41.340 --> 01:25:46.060]   I mean, you know John keeps it like pristine. So it's just it's pristine once you go in there
[01:25:46.060 --> 01:25:48.060]   It's like a it's perfect. What did they use?
[01:25:48.060 --> 01:25:50.060]   Like a dubbing booth
[01:25:50.060 --> 01:25:54.100]   Well, it originally was used. I think it was originally used as a fully pit
[01:25:54.100 --> 01:25:59.340]   And then it and then the guy got sand and you got mud you got plaster
[01:25:59.340 --> 01:26:03.420]   I can and then and then the guys well the guys moved and then
[01:26:03.420 --> 01:26:07.180]   Spaz the Williams and and
[01:26:07.180 --> 01:26:14.540]   Moved in there and that's where they did the first walking cycles for the T-Rex and that was in the pit
[01:26:15.060 --> 01:26:17.900]   Yeah, that was in the pit. Yeah, that was the very first T-Rex
[01:26:17.900 --> 01:26:23.420]   That was their office was the pit because I on that great and you recommended that on the Disney Plus
[01:26:23.420 --> 01:26:30.340]   They have that great documentary about ILM and they talk about this because this was for Jurassic Park
[01:26:30.340 --> 01:26:32.340]   They were still using practical
[01:26:32.340 --> 01:26:38.620]   effects and and you know little stop action dinosaurs and and and and and
[01:26:38.620 --> 01:26:44.620]   They and the guys nickname is spaz is blue thing correct as it is and Wilson
[01:26:44.620 --> 01:26:48.340]   Said we think we could do a group. Oh, well
[01:26:48.340 --> 01:26:53.580]   I don't know who the other guy was anyway that we could do it in a computer because it was a very early days of computer graphics
[01:26:53.580 --> 01:26:55.580]   So they just on their own time
[01:26:55.580 --> 01:26:58.260]   animated a T-Rex and
[01:26:58.260 --> 01:27:00.260]   Then what said to Spielberg?
[01:27:00.260 --> 01:27:05.300]   Can we well or so the story is right the story is is that?
[01:27:05.300 --> 01:27:09.940]   There were still the that you weren't supposed to do that like you weren't supposed to do the CG
[01:27:09.940 --> 01:27:11.940]   They had already had a plan. They had a way to do this
[01:27:11.940 --> 01:27:18.220]   They had a guy building building giant T-Rex stop action model
[01:27:18.220 --> 01:27:23.980]   The story I heard was that that that Steve just left it running on his monitor when Steven Spielberg came down
[01:27:23.980 --> 01:27:30.420]   Like he didn't say anything about it. There was no proposal. It doesn't it's not told that way in the in the in the documentary
[01:27:30.420 --> 01:27:32.420]   but I heard was
[01:27:32.420 --> 01:27:39.620]   And and Spielberg looked at it and just was like what is that you know and that and and I the
[01:27:39.980 --> 01:27:43.380]   Rumor is that a lot of folks at ILM were not happy
[01:27:43.380 --> 01:27:46.300]   Because it was not
[01:27:46.300 --> 01:27:48.600]   George could be oh chiefly Dennis
[01:27:48.600 --> 01:27:50.300]   You know Dennis was not super excited about it
[01:27:50.300 --> 01:27:54.100]   He got an Academy Award for it, but he wasn't I don't think he was very happy at the moment because it a
[01:27:54.100 --> 01:27:58.540]   Looking back now as somebody runs a company. It was definitely not a
[01:27:58.540 --> 01:28:04.860]   You created a whole new set of variables that no one knew how to fall. Yeah, yeah
[01:28:04.860 --> 01:28:09.900]   Very interesting very very it's like well worth seeing
[01:28:10.180 --> 01:28:11.140]   fiber
[01:28:11.140 --> 01:28:13.900]   Yeah, fiber Steve spas Williams and
[01:28:13.900 --> 01:28:19.140]   His his partner. I will remain name was forever
[01:28:19.140 --> 01:28:23.460]   Hey, I think mark that sounds right. Yeah, I'm trying to remember
[01:28:23.460 --> 01:28:28.940]   Anyway, it's worth watching the documentary for the clean version of what really happened
[01:28:28.940 --> 01:28:34.980]   Now, you know the truth the the corporate approved version history. Yeah
[01:28:36.380 --> 01:28:41.100]   So there is some other news is there anything else about this announcement that we wanted to talk about it
[01:28:41.100 --> 01:28:44.140]   I don't want to leave anything undone mark dippy
[01:28:44.140 --> 01:28:50.900]   I think it's the pain but to pay mark to pay it is dippy, but he calls himself to pay
[01:28:50.900 --> 01:28:54.460]   No, it's kind of an old mount
[01:29:01.100 --> 01:29:06.380]   All right, nothing else going going gone digital ID on phones perhaps
[01:29:06.380 --> 01:29:09.420]   Coming to California
[01:29:09.420 --> 01:29:17.340]   The governor didn't mention apple though, which was weird during his budget speech governor Gavin Newsom
[01:29:17.340 --> 01:29:22.620]   Said in a matter of months. We're finally gonna have those digital wallets
[01:29:22.620 --> 01:29:28.940]   Okay, Gavin. You sound like an old guy. We're gonna have those you know, it's digital wallet do hikkeys
[01:29:29.140 --> 01:29:33.780]   Where you can get your driver's license on a digital wallet? We're gonna do it like no other state has done it
[01:29:33.780 --> 01:29:38.100]   Well, other states have used apple. There's only a few that have but there's issues
[01:29:38.100 --> 01:29:44.660]   Ours we think he's starting to talk sound like Donald Trump if they're gonna be great. We think it'll be next level
[01:29:44.660 --> 01:29:47.780]   We're so excited about what the DMV can look like
[01:29:47.780 --> 01:29:55.940]   Obviously ad-libbing here, but I wonder apple it did not mention California when they mentioned the states that have committed to use
[01:29:55.940 --> 01:29:58.500]   digital IDs and apple wallet
[01:29:58.740 --> 01:30:01.860]   Sure sounds like he got a briefing a couple weeks ago and then somebody
[01:30:01.860 --> 01:30:04.420]   Yeah, yeah, we got that thing
[01:30:04.420 --> 01:30:10.180]   On the computers other states have done it, but we're not gonna do it like they've done it
[01:30:10.180 --> 01:30:14.180]   Well, maybe if you have done it, I don't anyway, we'll do better though. It'll be awesome. It'll be great
[01:30:14.180 --> 01:30:17.940]   The kids in the DMV tell me it'll be great
[01:30:17.940 --> 01:30:24.980]   You know, you know like when you go to the store and you can just run the thing over the thing and it goes beep
[01:30:25.060 --> 01:30:32.020]   You get charged. It'll be like that only five times. I'm being but a bang and then you were on an airplane. Yeah, I just hope
[01:30:32.020 --> 01:30:34.180]   This is
[01:30:34.180 --> 01:30:36.340]   Unfortunately, like the federal government has some given
[01:30:36.340 --> 01:30:40.500]   State IDs are as the name implies
[01:30:40.500 --> 01:30:44.420]   Controlled by the states. There's no federal legislation that says that here's what a state
[01:30:44.420 --> 01:30:48.340]   Yeah, he has to do as far as as far as I know less than i looked into it was a few years ago
[01:30:48.340 --> 01:30:52.820]   But this is one of the things where you absolutely want the dust solution
[01:30:52.980 --> 01:30:56.420]   Available you want the you don't want the most innovative you don't want the most
[01:30:56.420 --> 01:31:05.380]   Ex most incredible and slick and whatever you want something so that if someone has a really cheap free with a one-year data commitment
[01:31:05.380 --> 01:31:09.460]   Phone that it will work on that phone because you can't have features
[01:31:09.460 --> 01:31:14.500]   You can't have this be only easy for people who can afford an apple phone or even a Samsung phone
[01:31:14.500 --> 01:31:16.500]   It has to be something that works for everybody
[01:31:16.500 --> 01:31:19.540]   One week ago mark german said
[01:31:20.660 --> 01:31:24.020]   apple is working on adding touch screens to its Mac computers
[01:31:24.020 --> 01:31:31.220]   Uh, but it won't be don't get your hopes up. It's not gonna be today. It's not gonna be next year
[01:31:31.220 --> 01:31:33.220]   It's gonna be in 2020
[01:31:33.220 --> 01:31:40.020]   Five as part of a larger update to the macbook pro according to the people who asked not to be identified because of the plans i'm private
[01:31:40.020 --> 01:31:44.340]   Yeah, but that's i'm glad that they're if this is true
[01:31:44.340 --> 01:31:48.900]   I'm glad that apple's breaking what used to what what is currently a serious dogma
[01:31:48.900 --> 01:31:54.260]   It's not i don't think that they seriously think about how the mac could be enhanced with screen displays
[01:31:54.260 --> 01:31:56.340]   I don't think they've done what they've historically done
[01:31:56.340 --> 01:32:03.540]   Which is look at what has been done with touch screen displays on windows and looked at what works and what doesn't work and put their own spin on it
[01:32:03.540 --> 01:32:10.100]   I do think that they've been trapped by dogma saying that our touch our touch screen touch screen operating system is ipad o s
[01:32:10.100 --> 01:32:13.860]   For large screens mac o s is not a touch screen o s
[01:32:14.500 --> 01:32:21.140]   When we have seen how really really wonderful touch screen on a large screen can can actually be and we were just talking
[01:32:21.140 --> 01:32:27.780]   I was just saying last week that if apple ever came out with an ipad a mac and tawson an ipad pro form factor
[01:32:27.780 --> 01:32:31.380]   Oh my god, would i be first in line to buy something like that because
[01:32:31.380 --> 01:32:37.940]   All the all the advantages of this tiny tiny little thin thing that has a a clip on clip on
[01:32:37.940 --> 01:32:42.180]   Typeable keyboard with the ability to simply freestyle it on the sofa
[01:32:43.460 --> 01:32:50.420]   And still be able to run mac opera mac full desktop apps instead of having to still deal with what you're ideal with when you're running ipad o s
[01:32:50.420 --> 01:32:53.060]   Oh my god. I'd be so quick in line for that
[01:32:53.060 --> 01:32:59.060]   I suppose it'd be nice to have the choice, but I do notice that uh like this desktop has touch but I never use it
[01:32:59.060 --> 01:33:04.500]   Uh, and it's that gorilla arm thing is micro searching calls it where you know, you know, I mean
[01:33:04.500 --> 01:33:07.140]   Yeah, I think I think that's I think that's really short-sighted
[01:33:07.700 --> 01:33:13.540]   Note no pun intended because the the the the idea is that oh well it doesn't work because i'm not going to be taking my hands off the keyboard
[01:33:13.540 --> 01:33:15.940]   To do a touch take my hands off the keyboard to do a touch
[01:33:15.940 --> 01:33:21.220]   Let's not forget that we're not that far away from when apple said hey take your hands off the keyboard to do to uh to
[01:33:21.220 --> 01:33:25.540]   Look at this little touch bar to hit this little touch bar above the keyboard
[01:33:25.540 --> 01:33:30.980]   And also it's not necessarily if if I have a trackpad between my hands i'm going to be using it if I got a mouse under my hand
[01:33:30.980 --> 01:33:35.860]   I'm going to be using it what it's good for is when you are literally just trying to scroll scroll scroll
[01:33:36.260 --> 01:33:42.100]   Through times even when i'm using my iPad when I switch to be the ip my mac book and I will just almost
[01:33:42.100 --> 01:33:49.300]   reflexively reach into to to scroll pinch and zoom because that's the way that I interact with screens these days
[01:33:49.300 --> 01:33:54.500]   I would at least like to see apple look at what amac can be with touch screen
[01:33:54.500 --> 01:33:59.300]   I think they would come up with something that's would really bring things forward and make me make me
[01:33:59.300 --> 01:34:00.580]   uh
[01:34:00.580 --> 01:34:06.260]   Make me less jealous at times when I look at exciting form factors in the window space of laptops
[01:34:06.260 --> 01:34:08.180]   Right there. I mean there are two paths for them here, right?
[01:34:08.180 --> 01:34:15.140]   There is this conservative path which I agree about I mean gorilla arms is about spending all day with your arms extended touching a
[01:34:15.140 --> 01:34:19.540]   Screen that's that's perpendicular to your keyboard and like yeah, okay, of course not but
[01:34:19.540 --> 01:34:21.940]   Uh using one of those laptops
[01:34:21.940 --> 01:34:27.940]   It's all second nature to literally everybody now that you see a uh a dialogue box on screen and you want to tap it closed
[01:34:28.020 --> 01:34:33.300]   Or you want to just move a finger on the screen and flick it to flick up the web browser and that is not a gorilla arms gesture
[01:34:33.300 --> 01:34:36.900]   It's a very simple gesture and and they're not going to take the trackpad away
[01:34:36.900 --> 01:34:40.820]   It's just an additional input method. That's a very conservative path for apple to walk
[01:34:40.820 --> 01:34:43.380]   But I feel like they could walk it and you know
[01:34:43.380 --> 01:34:50.100]   Every year that passes there are more people out there who think of touch as being something that should be on every single screen in existence
[01:34:50.100 --> 01:34:57.140]   The other path is what Andy says, which is if you've got a touchscreen you can like apple hasn't made a new looking macbook
[01:34:57.620 --> 01:35:03.540]   For what 12 13 years and I I think they've I think they've kind of perfected the perpendicular
[01:35:03.540 --> 01:35:05.620]   laptop thing
[01:35:05.620 --> 01:35:10.100]   But on the window side with touch you end up with this scenario where it's like well
[01:35:10.100 --> 01:35:16.420]   What if I folded the keyboard back or what if I detached the keyboard and apple is not ever been able to plan that space on the mac
[01:35:16.420 --> 01:35:21.460]   Only on the ipad because of the lack of touch and I don't know whether they will choose to go down that path
[01:35:21.460 --> 01:35:26.180]   But boy I also would be very interested interested in seeing what would happen if apple said
[01:35:26.340 --> 01:35:31.380]   What if we had a mac OS laptop that you can pull a keyboard off of and use with apple pencil and touch that would be
[01:35:31.380 --> 01:35:36.900]   Really interesting. I just wonder when when the ipad just runs mac OS
[01:35:36.900 --> 01:35:39.380]   You know like these are coming so close together
[01:35:39.380 --> 01:35:45.060]   You know and the thing is now that we have resolve running on the ipad and you can hack it so that it opens up the other windows
[01:35:45.060 --> 01:35:51.540]   Uh that aren't that aren't released yet. It is it's obvious that the these two things developing for both of these
[01:35:51.700 --> 01:35:55.220]   Starts to come together. So I maybe they have the mac do that
[01:35:55.220 --> 01:36:00.740]   But maybe you just have something that's a little bit more beefy than the ipad pro that is otherwise
[01:36:00.740 --> 01:36:05.620]   You know run something. I just feel like the two of them are coming to get very very close together now
[01:36:05.620 --> 01:36:06.420]   You know
[01:36:06.420 --> 01:36:09.220]   There are a lot of people who use some use max's drawing tablets with a cintiq
[01:36:09.220 --> 01:36:12.900]   A screen attached to it and yeah, so the idea of having that well
[01:36:12.900 --> 01:36:16.980]   No, don't buy this external display that kind of put some distance between you and the content
[01:36:17.540 --> 01:36:22.340]   Here is a 16 inch or even an 18 inch or 20 inch mac that will work with apple pencil
[01:36:22.340 --> 01:36:27.140]   A lot of creatives video editing even video editors, but certainly artists
[01:36:27.140 --> 01:36:31.780]   Designers would absolutely go in for that. Well, and I think that when you do that though to
[01:36:31.780 --> 01:36:34.820]   The point that was made earlier is that you want to get rid of the keyboard
[01:36:34.820 --> 01:36:36.820]   So if you want to start drawing you want to pull that off
[01:36:36.820 --> 01:36:42.980]   And have it be something that that you're drawing on the keyboard is part of what makes the quote-unquote gorilla arms
[01:36:42.980 --> 01:36:44.740]   Is reaching over this keyboard?
[01:36:44.740 --> 01:36:50.660]   So I think that if apple goes to a point where a macbook does that it just feels like it's just a bigger iPad at some point
[01:36:50.660 --> 01:36:53.460]   You know like it that gives you the mac os running on it
[01:36:53.460 --> 01:36:59.540]   It's detachable you have a detachable keyboard that you can draw on and and do all the other things and that would be I mean
[01:36:59.540 --> 01:37:01.860]   That would be amazing like it would be really cool
[01:37:01.860 --> 01:37:04.500]   I think I'm with bassinet, but I think they could figure some things out
[01:37:04.500 --> 01:37:10.500]   And I mean as we're discussing this I could think about all the times when the original mac was kind of dismissed that
[01:37:10.500 --> 01:37:14.820]   Hey people don't take their hands off the keyboard to keep touching this mouse thing off the side
[01:37:14.820 --> 01:37:21.460]   And say well imagine imagine a world in which apps are designed for the mouse and designed to be used that way
[01:37:21.460 --> 01:37:26.020]   Uh and look at the thing about all the times when all you're doing is you're scrolling anyway
[01:37:26.020 --> 01:37:28.420]   Or using the page up page down keys on the keyboard anyway
[01:37:28.420 --> 01:37:36.260]   Couldn't that be easier? So these are questions that are being answered really really well on the on promo s on on on windows
[01:37:36.420 --> 01:37:41.140]   I would love to see again apple investigate that on the mac because I think they could do some really great stuff
[01:37:41.140 --> 01:37:47.700]   And my question isn't actually Alex said, you know, what about the ipad? I actually start to think about it from the other direction, which is
[01:37:47.700 --> 01:37:54.580]   What about the mac like the ipad pro not the base level ipad that is used so commonly
[01:37:54.580 --> 01:37:58.980]   But that ipad pro that apple and I love the ipad pro but like apple is invested so much time
[01:37:58.980 --> 01:38:01.300]   So many resources in
[01:38:01.300 --> 01:38:05.860]   Making a more finder like files app and do inventing a pointer which is a great pointer
[01:38:05.860 --> 01:38:10.980]   And trying to do like driver kit and they built the magic keyboard to give it a keyboard and a trackpad
[01:38:10.980 --> 01:38:13.940]   They did they've done all this stuff to sort of make it like a laptop
[01:38:13.940 --> 01:38:16.900]   But they can never quite get there because it's hard
[01:38:16.900 --> 01:38:22.260]   For something that was built around being all touch and originally being an iphone to do that
[01:38:22.260 --> 01:38:26.500]   And I wonder at some point if you might not say what if we approach this from the mac side
[01:38:26.740 --> 01:38:31.540]   And what if all the work we've done on the ipad allows us to create a better tablet mode on macOS
[01:38:31.540 --> 01:38:34.900]   That runs ipad apps and mac apps or whatever
[01:38:34.900 --> 01:38:38.740]   And not to say this is easy. This is all really hard stuff that would take years
[01:38:38.740 --> 01:38:40.180]   But I wonder
[01:38:40.180 --> 01:38:46.260]   There's a possibility at least that inside apple they've looked at this and said maybe we went around about this from the wrong direction
[01:38:46.260 --> 01:38:50.580]   I think they started thinking about it. That's what's good years ago saying maybe
[01:38:50.580 --> 01:38:53.460]   But I mean he says it's not gonna be out for two years
[01:38:53.940 --> 01:38:59.780]   I think he's kind of saying that that glacial movement towards that has produced
[01:38:59.780 --> 01:39:03.220]   A product but it's gonna take a while
[01:39:03.220 --> 01:39:07.540]   You see they've been doing it for 15 years Alex maybe 10 really 10
[01:39:07.540 --> 01:39:09.860]   See people internally have been looking at it
[01:39:09.860 --> 01:39:14.020]   And was it the executives was a steve jobs who kept it from happening?
[01:39:14.020 --> 01:39:18.980]   I don't think I don't think anyone's kept it from happening. I think merging the two operating systems is really complicated
[01:39:18.980 --> 01:39:21.700]   Oh, you know, it's emerging
[01:39:21.700 --> 01:39:27.380]   Such a mack OS you know, like I'm saying that that having having the two of them coming together not not to me
[01:39:27.380 --> 01:39:32.820]   Maybe one OS but you now have a unified hardware infrastructure. You have a unify
[01:39:32.820 --> 01:39:36.180]   I mean, there's a lot of certainly moved a long way to a long time
[01:39:36.180 --> 01:39:41.380]   You know to to that m2 air and the m2 ipad pro are basically the same
[01:39:41.380 --> 01:39:46.900]   Right and yet one of them runs one OS and one runs the other and they have some apps in common
[01:39:47.460 --> 01:39:51.700]   And and let's not forget the opportunity cost sort of that's lost here
[01:39:51.700 --> 01:39:56.820]   Which is if you if you say artificially the mack can never be anything but a standard laptop
[01:39:56.820 --> 01:39:59.860]   And all of the things must be handled by the ipad
[01:39:59.860 --> 01:40:02.580]   I mean why why does it have to be that way?
[01:40:02.580 --> 01:40:05.940]   But they have they have steadfastly up to now said that that has to be the case
[01:40:05.940 --> 01:40:08.100]   And as much as I like the ipad
[01:40:08.100 --> 01:40:12.900]   You can't deny the fact that they have tried so hard to make it like the mack
[01:40:12.900 --> 01:40:15.620]   And that there's probably somebody on the other side saying
[01:40:16.260 --> 01:40:23.940]   Or what if it was the mac and have a simplified ipad mode for certain circumstances instead of trying to shove
[01:40:23.940 --> 01:40:28.260]   All this stuff into ipad os where maybe it's just not a great fit
[01:40:28.260 --> 01:40:32.340]   Well, and I think that the other thing is is that it's I don't think that the macOS is going away
[01:40:32.340 --> 01:40:37.700]   But I think that the the to to Jason's point that we just get to a point where we want to run mac apps
[01:40:37.700 --> 01:40:41.460]   You know on the on the ipad and just just go full screen and do what we're going to do
[01:40:41.460 --> 01:40:45.700]   Because we're already running the ipad apps on the mac and we do that all the time like mix effect pro
[01:40:45.700 --> 01:40:49.140]   Which is something we use a lot is we just run them on mac minis because it's a lot more
[01:40:49.140 --> 01:40:52.980]   You know, it's a lot easier to sit in a in a server than an ipad is
[01:40:52.980 --> 01:41:00.500]   And so and and running ipad apps on the on a mac went from this is really cool to I can't believe you're not doing it
[01:41:00.500 --> 01:41:03.620]   Like you you immediately like oh and then when you start looking at
[01:41:03.620 --> 01:41:09.140]   Resolve I think resolve is the first real app that you go. Oh like that's a real
[01:41:09.140 --> 01:41:14.420]   hard to do mac app that is running on a ipad, you know and
[01:41:14.980 --> 01:41:17.940]   And I think that that is I just think that you'll
[01:41:17.940 --> 01:41:23.460]   More one or two ipads away from you just being able to switch the ipad mode to macOS and
[01:41:23.460 --> 01:41:25.860]   Right or or mac books away
[01:41:25.860 --> 01:41:30.900]   Right because it might not be an ipad because I think they're going to be ipads that aren't macs for a long time
[01:41:30.900 --> 01:41:34.740]   If not forever because I think it is a successful product at the lower end
[01:41:34.740 --> 01:41:39.460]   But at that high end like start to think about it. It's not even a it's a mac that can have an ipad mode
[01:41:39.460 --> 01:41:44.900]   Not an ipad that runs macOS remember they're all the same remember what happened when microsoft did that
[01:41:44.980 --> 01:41:46.180]   to windows
[01:41:46.180 --> 01:41:51.300]   Windows 8.1 and it was a disaster where they had a and they still do by the way
[01:41:51.300 --> 01:41:54.340]   But they've hidden the deep within windows have a tablet mode
[01:41:54.340 --> 01:41:59.060]   Uh, it really did a lot faster. They did a lot faster. Yeah, I mean
[01:41:59.060 --> 01:42:02.420]   I think the people at apple probably looked over the hedge there and said well
[01:42:02.420 --> 01:42:09.780]   We gotta be told not to do that to ourselves. Yeah, but they but to the credit they did bounce back really well with windows 10 and windows 11
[01:42:09.780 --> 01:42:14.340]   It switches it's I think that windows windows 10 and 11 and also
[01:42:15.140 --> 01:42:23.380]   Actually android does a really good job of explaining how you can design a unified interface that makes as much sense with touch
[01:42:23.380 --> 01:42:29.460]   Pan and with trackpad as maybe that's good song any other and I think that may well
[01:42:29.460 --> 01:42:35.460]   I think I think that one of the things that made me really happy to see oh, they think he's predicting it two years out
[01:42:35.460 --> 01:42:43.460]   It does imply it would imply for me that what there it will it will accompany and also an overhaul to the mac and tauge user interface
[01:42:43.780 --> 01:42:50.020]   So that not to make it dumber and more iPad like but to give it some of the qualities that those other two operating systems have where
[01:42:50.020 --> 01:42:54.740]   You don't really know you don't you don't really notice necessarily that
[01:42:54.740 --> 01:43:01.700]   Uh, the the buttons you're clicking on to the trackpad and the mouse and the the handles for moving windows around are all that different
[01:43:01.700 --> 01:43:08.740]   But once you switch into touch mode you notice that wow those touch targets are a lot easier to get to the the the the
[01:43:09.140 --> 01:43:15.940]   Low layer interface that tries to figure out what you're trying to tap with the mouse becomes a lot more complicated because now it has to figure out
[01:43:15.940 --> 01:43:20.020]   How you're gonna hit how are you gonna hit a target with the with a much more blunt instrument so to speak?
[01:43:20.020 --> 01:43:27.060]   So I think that I while I'm not really a fan of the whole at one point these two operating systems are going to become one thing
[01:43:27.060 --> 01:43:30.980]   I do believe that as it's been doing for the past five or six or seven years
[01:43:30.980 --> 01:43:36.500]   They're all going to continue to grow from each other so that someone who is switching from one to another
[01:43:36.980 --> 01:43:41.460]   And the course the workday won't feel it will feel as though they're having one seamless experience
[01:43:41.460 --> 01:43:45.060]   I may be not as convinced as y'all are I'm surprised actually
[01:43:45.060 --> 01:43:51.140]   Um, I know I must touch my screen because I have fingerprints on my macbook, but uh, it's unconscious
[01:43:51.140 --> 01:43:56.580]   Um, I feel like apples going at what apple's doing which is interesting is moving the apps
[01:43:56.580 --> 01:44:01.140]   from the ipad and iphone to the desktop without
[01:44:01.140 --> 01:44:04.660]   Just making the operating systems compatible
[01:44:05.380 --> 01:44:10.980]   Is probably 90 percent of it isn't it if you can get the iOS apps on your desktop
[01:44:10.980 --> 01:44:14.500]   Do you need I guess you still need touch for some of them and
[01:44:14.500 --> 01:44:22.180]   Well, aren't we already kind of seeing that with the ability to have my have my ipad pro right next to my my macbook screen
[01:44:22.180 --> 01:44:28.580]   Just simply roll my pointer. Yeah, it loves raining onto the other and not really be aware that now i'm in i'm in uh,
[01:44:28.580 --> 01:44:31.300]   I'm in not screen mirroring mode or screen extension mode
[01:44:31.300 --> 01:44:36.340]   I'm actually running ipadOS off of the same keyboard and mouse. I wonder what their plan is. I really do
[01:44:36.340 --> 01:44:39.220]   Anyway, it's an interesting data point for mark german and I think
[01:44:39.220 --> 01:44:45.780]   Something worth talking about real quickly just a couple more stories to get through before we get to your picks of the week
[01:44:45.780 --> 01:44:52.180]   Uh a couple of app store stories and there was an app that looked just like the ipad was called
[01:44:52.180 --> 01:44:54.100]   retro pod
[01:44:54.100 --> 01:44:57.620]   Uh, and then it got successful when viral on tick tock so apple yanked it
[01:44:58.900 --> 01:45:04.740]   Uh, they didn't say why they've yanked it or have the developers say why they yanked it but
[01:45:04.740 --> 01:45:12.180]   At least nine of five mac thinks it's because well it turns the iphone into an ipad and who would want that
[01:45:12.180 --> 01:45:20.340]   Well, once apple starts saying it's okay to to mimic an actual authentic apple product
[01:45:20.340 --> 01:45:23.300]   That opens the floodgaze to a lot of bad things so I could see why they're being
[01:45:23.300 --> 01:45:27.300]   It's not the first time there was another app called rewound the same thing happened in apple
[01:45:28.100 --> 01:45:32.180]   Uh yanked it this apple can't do anything about there is a boot rom
[01:45:32.180 --> 01:45:36.180]   exploit for the ipad nano oh
[01:45:36.180 --> 01:45:38.980]   third gen to fifth gen
[01:45:38.980 --> 01:45:42.660]   Uh, ten years too late says the headline, but I do recommend the article
[01:45:42.660 --> 01:45:45.780]   I do recommend the article because it's a very interesting
[01:45:45.780 --> 01:45:48.580]   article about how you would find
[01:45:48.580 --> 01:45:51.700]   An exploit how you would reverse engineer?
[01:45:51.700 --> 01:45:58.020]   The ipad tech stack and also a lot of information about the ipad tech stack i it's very everything's encrypted and signed
[01:45:58.580 --> 01:46:04.020]   They you know the bootloader is signed and it tries not to load something that's malicious and so forth
[01:46:04.020 --> 01:46:06.020]   So it's free it's really interesting
[01:46:06.020 --> 01:46:10.020]   To read how the author of this article figured it all out
[01:46:10.020 --> 01:46:15.220]   Uh, because he really wanted for some reason to reverse engineer a
[01:46:15.220 --> 01:46:20.820]   Third generation fourth generation fifth generation ipad nano of course
[01:46:20.820 --> 01:46:27.460]   If if you like this kind of thing, I guess somehow he was able to get a dump of the um, I guess he disassembled it
[01:46:27.860 --> 01:46:34.020]   A dump of the code and I love this part of the of the of the piece as you're looking at the code
[01:46:34.020 --> 01:46:36.580]   He says well
[01:46:36.580 --> 01:46:41.700]   Do you see that you see that right there? That's the bug
[01:46:41.700 --> 01:46:44.260]   Uh
[01:46:44.260 --> 01:46:47.620]   So if you feel can you see it the bug is right there
[01:46:47.620 --> 01:46:50.580]   if bm request type
[01:46:50.580 --> 01:46:55.140]   And and three equals zero the user controlled index
[01:46:55.700 --> 01:46:59.860]   Populated from the lower bite of the w index feel of the setup packet is used as an index
[01:46:59.860 --> 01:47:07.780]   Oh, no into g state usb handlers without any boundary checks children and you know what that means
[01:47:07.780 --> 01:47:15.940]   Jumping jump. Oh so fat. I love it. I love reading articles like this. That's it. The punks right there. Can you see it?
[01:47:15.940 --> 01:47:20.020]   So uh, but it's fascinating if you want to know how this kind of stuff happens
[01:47:20.020 --> 01:47:25.140]   You know how and and the kind of work it takes and it it's kind of cool. It's like code breaking
[01:47:25.460 --> 01:47:28.420]   Especially since it's an old device. Nobody cares about anyway
[01:47:28.420 --> 01:47:33.140]   Makes it what's these people these people there? They're they're like columbo. It's like yeah
[01:47:33.140 --> 01:47:37.060]   Well, there's there's this thing that just bugs me and it's gonna keep on
[01:47:37.060 --> 01:47:41.540]   I mean they're gonna keep on it and keep on it until it stops bugging them and will be and
[01:47:41.540 --> 01:47:48.260]   There's nothing silly about it. It's it's heroic. It's very very human to say that if this this this thing that's designed to keep me
[01:47:48.260 --> 01:47:50.420]   I'm believe that there's a way that I can get into that
[01:47:50.820 --> 01:47:55.300]   Surge and and now and now we're step closer to seeing it running doom, which is always the goal
[01:47:55.300 --> 01:47:57.220]   We're lennox
[01:47:57.220 --> 01:48:01.700]   Credit to surge bazansky who wrote the article his blog is q3k.org
[01:48:01.700 --> 01:48:06.580]   He says you want to be part of the useless old device zero days scene
[01:48:06.580 --> 01:48:13.780]   The play was in I love it. This is really cool. That's my kind of hacking. Oh, there's amazing isn't it amazing
[01:48:13.780 --> 01:48:19.700]   That's like the people who found a bug in apple 2 protos and released a new version of protos
[01:48:19.860 --> 01:48:26.180]   Wow 20 20 20 19 wow you boot up on the apple 2 and it says 2019 you go what?
[01:48:26.180 --> 01:48:31.700]   I love it. It's like we're fixing bugs from 1989 and we're
[01:48:31.700 --> 01:48:34.580]   hacking ipods from
[01:48:34.580 --> 01:48:39.540]   2009 i love retro tech is the best size. Yeah, cuz it's a very benign kind of hacking. I mean, yeah
[01:48:39.540 --> 01:48:42.180]   There's no exploit coming out of this is just fun
[01:48:42.180 --> 01:48:48.020]   Stinterest wasn't there an app wasn't there an apple 2 game that only recently finally had its copy protection cracked
[01:48:48.420 --> 01:48:53.380]   And when the person finally cracked it they found a hidden message from the developers saying, okay
[01:48:53.380 --> 01:48:55.380]   Well, I guess you finally like
[01:48:55.380 --> 01:49:00.500]   So so as reward here's a secret code for like upcoming game
[01:49:00.500 --> 01:49:03.940]   Like to get and nobody's figured out what that upcoming game is supposed to be
[01:49:03.940 --> 01:49:11.140]   And there are several new apple 2 games that have been released in the last five years where people have written
[01:49:11.140 --> 01:49:17.540]   It's just I love it. I it's so great. I think somebody did a new Atari 2600 game too like people
[01:49:18.100 --> 01:49:24.420]   That's the next level is you're not just emulating old systems. You're writing new software for old systems. It's amazing. Yeah, the best
[01:49:24.420 --> 01:49:29.940]   Goldman Sachs says you know that darn apple card thing it cost us a billion dollars
[01:49:29.940 --> 01:49:33.140]   How do you lose money doing a credit card?
[01:49:33.140 --> 01:49:37.300]   Goldman Sachs has found new ways to lose money
[01:49:37.300 --> 01:49:44.100]   You work with a company that is super specific about how they want and how they want it to work and are inflexible
[01:49:44.100 --> 01:49:46.260]   You know like you know and so I think that that
[01:49:46.420 --> 01:49:48.420]   You have to be always careful
[01:49:48.420 --> 01:49:52.740]   About working, you know the thing with apple is is that man they pay attention details
[01:49:52.740 --> 01:49:55.620]   You know and so you you'll look at something and think about how it would be
[01:49:55.620 --> 01:50:00.900]   Done in the real world and then you enter the apple world and they're like well
[01:50:00.900 --> 01:50:04.260]   We don't want it to be that way and we want it to be this easy and we want this to this interface
[01:50:04.260 --> 01:50:10.180]   We want this little edge on this little corner to be this way and it has to be that way or we can't release it
[01:50:10.180 --> 01:50:16.020]   And and we want the how the customer has told what to do has to be a very specific way and that
[01:50:16.420 --> 01:50:18.420]   All of that starts to add up
[01:50:18.420 --> 01:50:23.300]   Yeah, it's something and sometimes you find out that like the reason why apples
[01:50:23.300 --> 01:50:28.020]   Apple like oh we're sticklers on design and making it right and the best user experience
[01:50:28.020 --> 01:50:32.340]   And we don't understand we we think it's terrible that these other companies haven't been doing it thus far
[01:50:32.340 --> 01:50:38.180]   And then sometimes you find out well the reason why we haven't been doing it that way is because we go out of business in about 11
[01:50:38.180 --> 01:50:40.500]   Weeks if we did it exactly the way you want to do it
[01:50:40.980 --> 01:50:47.460]   It's not quite as dire with this story, but it does show like when you when you take your own business model and you try to adapt
[01:50:47.460 --> 01:50:52.580]   Assesses that are absolutely alien and new sometimes it is because again that we're dogma
[01:50:52.580 --> 01:50:57.540]   Sometimes it's because of fear and sometimes it really is because there's really is a third rail
[01:50:57.540 --> 01:51:01.140]   There's a way to navigate around it, but you got to be really careful around it
[01:51:01.140 --> 01:51:06.180]   Uh do not I guess we're gonna amend our recommendation for an apple tv
[01:51:06.180 --> 01:51:11.060]   Do not buy an apple tv if you don't have apple other apple devices particularly an iphone
[01:51:11.060 --> 01:51:14.900]   Uh somebody discovered this in the new apple tv
[01:51:14.900 --> 01:51:17.780]   You know os
[01:51:17.780 --> 01:51:22.180]   You have to have an iphone in order to accept the new ichloud terms and conditions it says
[01:51:22.180 --> 01:51:29.540]   You know update with iphone new clouds and conditions accept it on a device running ios 16 or later
[01:51:29.540 --> 01:51:34.980]   Uh, I don't know if there's a workaround yet. This is fairly fairly new information
[01:51:35.620 --> 01:51:38.120]   Came from a guy tweeting hughgugub
[01:51:38.120 --> 01:51:40.660]   hughgugugub says
[01:51:40.660 --> 01:51:47.700]   I own an apple tv. I own not a single other apple device not one every time I start the apple tv I get this prompt now
[01:51:47.700 --> 01:51:49.140]   apple
[01:51:49.140 --> 01:51:51.140]   What do you expect me to do about this?
[01:51:51.140 --> 01:51:55.700]   That would be annoying we we'd love to see you buy an iphone
[01:51:55.700 --> 01:51:58.820]   As a cook there's a standard response. Yes
[01:51:58.820 --> 01:52:00.740]   That's weird
[01:52:00.740 --> 01:52:05.540]   I don't know just a bug. Maybe it's a bug. Maybe they'll fix it because i'm sure they want to sell apple tv's to
[01:52:05.540 --> 01:52:07.540]   As many people want to buy them
[01:52:07.540 --> 01:52:10.180]   Yeah, I think it's a pretty un it's a it's a fairly
[01:52:10.180 --> 01:52:15.700]   Uncommon thing to see someone do is to not have any other mac and get an apple tv
[01:52:15.700 --> 01:52:21.700]   It may it probably is a bug, but it probably is because no one did it before yeah like it's
[01:52:21.700 --> 01:52:27.700]   Yeah, it's it's pretty rare because most people who are using the apple plus or apple tv plus
[01:52:27.700 --> 01:52:34.020]   That don't have that are using it. That's the one that shipped in the built in the tv and built into the tv
[01:52:34.100 --> 01:52:36.100]   Yeah, so it's it's a very interesting
[01:52:36.100 --> 01:52:41.540]   Behavior to to do that. I want to pass along consumer tip from the verge
[01:52:41.540 --> 01:52:47.380]   Sheena vasani. No, you cannot get a 16 terabyte ssd for a hundred bucks
[01:52:47.380 --> 01:52:53.700]   In case you were wondering apparently they're being am advertised on amazon
[01:52:53.700 --> 01:53:01.540]   Josh henryts and the editor-in-chief of review geek bought one of these torrid down found out inside 64 gigabit
[01:53:02.580 --> 01:53:06.660]   micro SD card and a usb 2.0 card reader
[01:53:06.660 --> 01:53:10.820]   Adrian kingsley hues in zdnet same thing
[01:53:10.820 --> 01:53:17.700]   The verges confirm there are several of these on the first page of results for external ssd
[01:53:17.700 --> 01:53:20.660]   Do not be tempted?
[01:53:20.660 --> 01:53:25.860]   A 16 terabyte external ssd should cost you much more than a hundred dollars like
[01:53:25.860 --> 01:53:28.580]   Maybe a couple of thousand
[01:53:28.900 --> 01:53:32.180]   So although the prices are dropping. I can see how people be fooled by this right
[01:53:32.180 --> 01:53:38.420]   Because you know hey wow the prices really have dropped a hundred bucks. Yeah, what a deal
[01:53:38.420 --> 01:53:41.860]   You're just paying for Samsung marketing. That's all
[01:53:41.860 --> 01:53:45.140]   It seems to be like a hundred dollars is the thing there was a stream deck
[01:53:45.140 --> 01:53:49.700]   You know that went out and suddenly we'll hundred dollars for a day or two days or something like that and a bunch of us bought it
[01:53:49.700 --> 01:53:54.500]   Knowing that probably I don't know if this is really going to work. Yeah, and yeah, I still I still have a
[01:53:55.140 --> 01:53:57.140]   Still sitting there, you know and I
[01:53:57.140 --> 01:53:59.940]   I mostly would want to see what would happen and you get into this
[01:53:59.940 --> 01:54:04.420]   It got the scammers got you into this thing where they set it shipping so it's in the state that
[01:54:04.420 --> 01:54:10.740]   And so they kind of sit in between but generally if something is way cheaper than it should be it probably is not
[01:54:10.740 --> 01:54:14.500]   Do you see my little cute little teeny winny stream deck that I got this
[01:54:14.500 --> 01:54:16.500]   I know I have one of those
[01:54:16.500 --> 01:54:18.500]   For PowerPoint or not PowerPoint, but you know
[01:54:18.500 --> 01:54:23.220]   That's how it starts. That's actually the little one and then you get to get one of those
[01:54:23.220 --> 01:54:28.500]   You got knobs and no no no no no no no no no your now your kitty can scream
[01:54:28.500 --> 01:54:34.660]   This actually john made for me. Did you buy it just for this or do we have one line around?
[01:54:34.660 --> 01:54:38.260]   Oh, well, we should buy it by your replacement
[01:54:38.260 --> 01:54:43.780]   So I can actually switch I can now switch shots. I could switch to the wide shot
[01:54:43.780 --> 01:54:46.580]   Just in case I want to like
[01:54:46.580 --> 01:54:50.260]   Give me the illusion of control is what this is all about
[01:54:52.740 --> 01:54:58.420]   Oh, don't go. Don't actually just stay here. I need you. It just turns on the light in the bathroom Leo
[01:54:58.420 --> 01:55:02.340]   Doesn't do anything
[01:55:02.340 --> 01:55:05.620]   Dropbox has announced they are going to finally support mac os
[01:55:05.620 --> 01:55:08.340]   12.5 and later

[01:55:37.540 --> 01:55:44.020]   I think I use dropbox. I'm pretty sure I use it on a mac. I guess it's just not native. Is that the issue? I don't know

[01:58:47.940 --> 01:58:51.060]   When we are down a person
[01:58:51.060 --> 01:58:57.060]   Alex lensy I rarely start with you because I know how expensive your picks of the week are but this time
[01:58:57.060 --> 01:58:59.620]   It's it's inexpensive
[01:59:00.260 --> 01:59:03.380]   Expensive it's just a little something that that I have to admit
[01:59:03.380 --> 01:59:08.820]   I didn't really had not researched in the past and I got finally came to the end of something and I'm right course
[01:59:08.820 --> 01:59:11.780]   I told Kevin in our office. He's like yeah, we've like five of those
[01:59:11.780 --> 01:59:14.100]   They already knew that we didn't have them
[01:59:14.100 --> 01:59:16.740]   So I just want to make sure no one else is embarrassed by the situation
[01:59:16.740 --> 01:59:20.020]   So I have a thing about mics that I hate mike threading
[01:59:20.020 --> 01:59:22.820]   So I hate the fact that they made it really fine
[01:59:22.820 --> 01:59:25.380]   It's like a skill test when you do the mics
[01:59:25.380 --> 01:59:28.500]   You screw it on and if you get it wrong, you're gonna strip that
[01:59:29.060 --> 01:59:30.820]   the the mike
[01:59:30.820 --> 01:59:34.820]   Threading out which drives me crazy and I have to put mics on a lot and I got
[01:59:34.820 --> 01:59:38.500]   I found a refresh fitting and I found these I bought a couple different ones
[01:59:38.500 --> 01:59:44.100]   And I found the one that I like the most is made by framework gator frameworks and all it is the quick release that just
[01:59:44.100 --> 01:59:49.060]   Oh, we need those a little so you put so you don't have to screw the like
[01:59:49.060 --> 01:59:51.780]   Stay you can buy these separately. Yeah
[01:59:51.780 --> 01:59:56.180]   I lost the thing for your mics. Yeah, so you put them all into the mics once right
[01:59:56.660 --> 02:00:01.460]   And then you have this this you put on your stand and all you have to do is pull it down and let it go
[02:00:01.460 --> 02:00:07.700]   Now it's locked in and there's no more wrapping it around and it's 25 bucks for the set
[02:00:07.700 --> 02:00:12.900]   You can of course buy these in sets of three you can buy these little the little mike inserts for a lot
[02:00:12.900 --> 02:00:14.180]   And I just
[02:00:14.180 --> 02:00:18.180]   I just start putting on everything which is like I'm just gonna put these on everything so I never have to
[02:00:18.180 --> 02:00:20.580]   to add a
[02:00:20.580 --> 02:00:22.420]   Rather have this than a new mac mini
[02:00:23.220 --> 02:00:24.420]   What's this?
[02:00:24.420 --> 02:00:25.620]   No, they're not as
[02:00:25.620 --> 02:00:31.620]   No, he says we don't need him. He's good as growing. He doesn't I don't ever strip
[02:00:31.620 --> 02:00:36.980]   It's not the mic. It's the mic holder. He's gonna bring it. Oh, I don't do it to the mic
[02:00:36.980 --> 02:00:40.980]   Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, the mic holders. That's the point. Yeah, yeah, but I
[02:00:40.980 --> 02:00:42.980]   But I always put them on different
[02:00:42.980 --> 02:00:47.380]   See I take I put them on different arms and we put them together and so and and I of course
[02:00:47.380 --> 02:00:52.180]   I told I was really excited about and I told somebody that does like live live events and they're looking at like yeah
[02:00:52.180 --> 02:00:57.380]   That's what we use for chon's mad at me because I I would dare to suggest we'd get this instead of a Mac mini
[02:00:57.380 --> 02:01:01.860]   No, we're gonna do your Mac mini. Don't worry, but this looks good great gator frameworks
[02:01:01.860 --> 02:01:06.900]   microphone quick clip quick release stand attachment
[02:01:06.900 --> 02:01:10.020]   On amazon 24 bucks for one
[02:01:10.020 --> 02:01:13.540]   But get a five pack. It's only 42 29
[02:01:13.540 --> 02:01:21.060]   Yeah, so if you're it's an a big that's it's yeah, yeah, it's uh, but it is a and then you got that's you can put them all in
[02:01:21.060 --> 02:01:24.420]   Yeah, yeah, yeah, got it. So it just makes life a lot easier
[02:01:24.420 --> 02:01:28.900]   If you're I have a lot of mics and a lot of stands and when you're going between them all it's nice
[02:01:28.900 --> 02:01:31.940]   It's all I guess get three for the price of two
[02:01:31.940 --> 02:01:38.100]   Exactly mr. Uh anti and that co what's your pick of the week here?
[02:01:38.100 --> 02:01:45.780]   Mine is a very esoteric text editor. We've talked so many times about how many how many other people on this panel love bb
[02:01:45.780 --> 02:01:50.660]   Edit because how many of us have a use for a plain text editor without any formatting just give me text
[02:01:50.740 --> 02:01:57.540]   Let me save it as a text while I found a text editor finally for ios and for my ipad that kind of fits the bill
[02:01:57.540 --> 02:02:06.420]   It's called runestone by simon stovering and it is exactly what you would want if you are into this kind of a text editor
[02:02:06.420 --> 02:02:12.340]   It is just a plain text editor, but with a very very good ipad o wis interface and
[02:02:12.340 --> 02:02:14.020]   the
[02:02:14.020 --> 02:02:18.900]   It's you could tell that it was a developer who wrote this to solve problems like my emacs interface
[02:02:19.700 --> 02:02:24.100]   Yeah, I don't exactly you you launch it you launch it and you the first time I launched it
[02:02:24.100 --> 02:02:27.460]   I got a little bit confused because like I didn't see like oh here's a blank document
[02:02:27.460 --> 02:02:33.140]   Here's it no it gives you it basically opens into the files app to give you a picker because it assumes that you're gonna want to edit
[02:02:33.140 --> 02:02:37.300]   Some code or edit a file that you've put on the ipad somewhere of course you can create new new documents
[02:02:37.300 --> 02:02:41.860]   But that's where you start with and the fact that it needs to it lets you figure out
[02:02:41.860 --> 02:02:48.660]   Let you determine what kind of text file do you want to create like what is it gonna be leunix line breaks is it gonna be mac line breaks
[02:02:49.060 --> 02:02:55.380]   uh the for free it's a basic text editor for the paltry sum of 10 bucks it will give you things like like
[02:02:55.380 --> 02:02:59.460]   Stuff you need for putting like syntax highlighting
[02:02:59.460 --> 02:03:00.820]   of
[02:03:00.820 --> 02:03:05.700]   the clothes basically controlling your opening clothes brackets and and stuff like that
[02:03:05.700 --> 02:03:12.100]   And it's I like it's the sort of thing that I definitely am going to keep it on my ipad because the number of times where
[02:03:12.100 --> 02:03:16.660]   All I got to do is I got to change one line in this text file that's on this device
[02:03:16.900 --> 02:03:21.540]   And that will like actually fix the problem for me or that will enable this thing and I can't do it
[02:03:21.540 --> 02:03:24.500]   Because I've got my ipad and every single text editor
[02:03:24.500 --> 02:03:29.300]   Assumes that oh by text editor. You just mean an un for unformatted word processing diagram
[02:03:29.300 --> 02:03:31.060]   No, I mean a text editor
[02:03:31.060 --> 02:03:35.380]   Let me actually control like what this file is and how another app is going to see it
[02:03:35.380 --> 02:03:41.140]   And I also really really like the way the way that they built it. It's also built on a
[02:03:42.100 --> 02:03:48.980]   On a framework called these calling roonstone, which is again basic text editing for ios and ipad os
[02:03:48.980 --> 02:03:51.380]   So it's I think for 10 bucks
[02:03:51.380 --> 02:03:56.420]   I feel like i'm supporting someone who's doing something really really cool and bringing something to the ipad that I personally
[02:03:56.420 --> 02:03:57.860]   Haven't really seen before
[02:03:57.860 --> 02:04:02.420]   Simon is the developer of scriptable which is an app that I've talked about for a while now and and
[02:04:02.420 --> 02:04:06.020]   And roonstone is literally he decided to redo scriptables text editor
[02:04:06.020 --> 02:04:08.660]   And that's a job of script based development environment
[02:04:08.900 --> 02:04:13.620]   And then he did the thing which is like i'm going to make this a product that i'm going to make available for free within that purchase
[02:04:13.620 --> 02:04:15.860]   And i'm going to open source it and that's the beauty of it
[02:04:15.860 --> 02:04:20.740]   So there are actually a bunch of other apps that are starting to come out for ios where they've thrown away their
[02:04:20.740 --> 02:04:25.140]   Code editor and replaced it with the roonstone framework because it's better. It's great
[02:04:25.140 --> 02:04:30.340]   That's very cool. I wonder if it supports lisp
[02:04:30.340 --> 02:04:33.380]   Anyway
[02:04:33.380 --> 02:04:36.980]   Nobody he's he seems young he might not know
[02:04:36.980 --> 02:04:41.540]   I don't know what that is. Yeah, yeah, i'm holding on for apl
[02:04:41.540 --> 02:04:45.380]   poor emax to the ipad then
[02:04:45.380 --> 02:04:48.500]   Then you'll know it's it's made the big time
[02:04:48.500 --> 02:04:51.780]   Mr. Jason snell, what's your pick of the week?
[02:04:51.780 --> 02:04:55.860]   You know I sit on these podcasts and I you you probably know this leo
[02:04:55.860 --> 02:05:01.380]   You can't remember like what podcast did I say that on I know I said that somewhere was in the conversation with friends
[02:05:01.380 --> 02:05:05.700]   Was it on a podcast and I decided one of my i'm not sure it was a new year's resolution
[02:05:05.700 --> 02:05:12.660]   But something I decided I wanted to do this year was have a little bit of a record of the stuff that I've said on some of my podcasts
[02:05:12.660 --> 02:05:15.460]   So that I could refer to it later instead of being like I don't know
[02:05:15.460 --> 02:05:22.660]   I think I talked about it and I decided to look into whisper the open AI framework that allows you to
[02:05:22.660 --> 02:05:25.620]   Generate text out of audio files
[02:05:25.620 --> 02:05:31.700]   Anywhere and so I first downloaded their python based version which is great
[02:05:32.180 --> 02:05:36.420]   The quality of the transcript based on the mp3 file you feed it is remarkable
[02:05:36.420 --> 02:05:41.460]   But in python it's actually incredibly slow. It takes like five hours to do an hour of audio
[02:05:41.460 --> 02:05:47.620]   But then I went to the website for whisper dot app which is or whisper dot cpp which is
[02:05:47.620 --> 02:05:53.060]   A guy compiled it using c and that one is basically one to one
[02:05:53.060 --> 02:05:56.900]   So you can do an hour long podcast in an hour and get a great transcript out of it
[02:05:56.900 --> 02:05:59.700]   And it'll come out as a plain text you can get it as a subtitles file
[02:06:00.980 --> 02:06:06.180]   And and that is and then I found that you could tweak it so that you can actually use all the cores on my max studio
[02:06:06.180 --> 02:06:11.140]   And then I can I can do about two to one now where I can get do a two-hour podcast in about 45 minutes
[02:06:11.140 --> 02:06:15.060]   Uh, so I'm I'm well on my way to transcribing my past podcasts
[02:06:15.060 --> 02:06:17.940]   So I know what the heck I said when somebody asked me did you ever say this?
[02:06:17.940 --> 02:06:23.460]   Which is great and then there's a guy who's just came out just come up with an app called mac whisper
[02:06:23.460 --> 02:06:27.700]   Which is really just a ui what wrapper on the c library?
[02:06:27.700 --> 02:06:33.460]   And I think there will be many more of these but really what I wanted to just say is that the whisper framework is so good
[02:06:33.460 --> 02:06:38.820]   It doesn't identify different speakers voices right now. So it's all sort of in one list
[02:06:38.820 --> 02:06:45.540]   But the quality of the transcript it's not perfect, but it is the best by far that i've seen
[02:06:45.540 --> 02:06:48.020]   You can run it on your mac
[02:06:48.020 --> 02:06:50.900]   And it's a reasonable amount of time. That's kind of amazing
[02:06:50.900 --> 02:06:55.940]   If you're if you're capable at all with the command line getting the c interface and get and uh
[02:06:55.940 --> 02:06:57.940]   Installing that it's a couple of command line commands
[02:06:57.940 --> 02:07:04.420]   And then you can kind of go to town with it. It also makes me feel like we are we are definitely a year or two away
[02:07:04.420 --> 02:07:10.980]   From having auto-generated podcast transcripts that are completely readable and that identify the name of each speaker
[02:07:10.980 --> 02:07:14.420]   And are and and that will be great for accessibility
[02:07:14.420 --> 02:07:16.260]   But we're we're close because this
[02:07:16.260 --> 02:07:21.220]   The quality of this transcript and the fact that I can just run it on my mac and my mac is more than capable of doing it
[02:07:21.220 --> 02:07:25.540]   Says what you know, it's we're almost there. We're right around the corner. Is it like uh
[02:07:26.100 --> 02:07:30.260]   Stable diffusion and other AI tools where you download models
[02:07:30.260 --> 02:07:36.420]   Yeah, they have multiple models the one I use is the highest quality of the meat of the english only models
[02:07:36.420 --> 02:07:41.060]   Which is called medium the slut the small model isn't that great the medium model is a lot slower
[02:07:41.060 --> 02:07:43.860]   But it's way better and then they've got a high quality model
[02:07:43.860 --> 02:07:47.620]   That's also trained on a bunch of different languages and one of the command line flags
[02:07:47.620 --> 02:07:53.380]   I thought this was really great if you are not comfortable listening to a podcast because it's not in your
[02:07:53.860 --> 02:07:56.740]   Best language. There's a command line flag
[02:07:56.740 --> 02:08:01.780]   You you feed it something in a different language and say while you're there translated into my language
[02:08:01.780 --> 02:08:08.660]   And it'll do that too, which is pretty we are so we are just right on the bottom of the hockey stick
[02:08:08.660 --> 02:08:11.700]   This is all about to transform. I think I mean, it's amazing
[02:08:11.700 --> 02:08:16.020]   So a year from now, it'll just be a button, you know or something
[02:08:16.020 --> 02:08:18.980]   It's just amazing. Yeah, and I'm surprised google hasn't done this yet
[02:08:18.980 --> 02:08:23.380]   But I do think we are very very close to the ability to to like everything that's in a podcast world
[02:08:23.460 --> 02:08:26.580]   Will be indexed somewhere and you can find that stuff
[02:08:26.580 --> 02:08:30.660]   And I guess that means that if we said something dumb four years ago, we're not going to be able to hide
[02:08:30.660 --> 02:08:35.540]   No, but but the benefits of having that available so people can say hey Jason
[02:08:35.540 --> 02:08:39.940]   When did you recommend that thing if you don't have a site like mbw picks
[02:08:39.940 --> 02:08:45.700]   Uh, you could still find stuff that I said three years ago if you want to and I think that's all for the all for the good
[02:08:45.700 --> 02:08:47.860]   Yeah, this is quite amazing. Yeah open AI
[02:08:47.860 --> 02:08:53.380]   Of course that the folks who chat gpt and dolly too and they were founded
[02:08:53.460 --> 02:08:58.900]   By elan musk and microsoft just put another it's rumored 10 billion dollars into them
[02:08:58.900 --> 02:09:00.820]   They're going to fold it into
[02:09:00.820 --> 02:09:06.260]   Office and and the point of it was to do uh ai development in the in the open
[02:09:06.260 --> 02:09:12.580]   In the public as opposed to do it secretly behind doors at google or apple or microsoft or elsewhere
[02:09:12.580 --> 02:09:16.980]   And I think that's a very laudable goal, but also notice how much faster
[02:09:16.980 --> 02:09:18.820]   It's happening right
[02:09:18.820 --> 02:09:23.220]   Uh, and I think having these be open source and having people contribute to it and try it and
[02:09:23.540 --> 02:09:27.940]   Has made an apples difference apples building in the neural engine. I got this max studio
[02:09:27.940 --> 02:09:35.060]   I've got has got a what eight 10 12 core neural engine too and this see this sea build doesn't even use that right and it's not using the gpu
[02:09:35.060 --> 02:09:43.620]   It's just using the cpu so that's we've also seen that apple apple is now embracing these ai models and trying to because it's an advantage for apple
[02:09:43.620 --> 02:09:48.500]   Because they've got that neural engine on their hardware that does this stuff really fast
[02:09:48.500 --> 02:09:52.420]   So I think that that's going to be a next step too is that we're going to see the next version of this
[02:09:52.420 --> 02:09:57.060]   Somebody's going to do a build of this that really can floor it on apple hardware
[02:09:57.060 --> 02:10:02.180]   And I can't wait to see that it should be much faster than real time. You should be able to yeah, you know scan an hour and a minute or two
[02:10:02.180 --> 02:10:04.500]   uh
[02:10:04.500 --> 02:10:08.740]   I think it's going to be really exciting to see when you look at what we talked about last week, which was the
[02:10:08.740 --> 02:10:10.020]   um
[02:10:10.020 --> 02:10:11.380]   the movement of
[02:10:11.380 --> 02:10:15.940]   Being able to take almost any book and turn it into a reasonably good thing to listen to
[02:10:15.940 --> 02:10:19.140]   And then you look at this being able to translate into lots of languages
[02:10:19.140 --> 02:10:24.020]   The amount of knowledge going back and forth is going to explode, you know, and it's just gonna be really interesting
[02:10:24.020 --> 02:10:26.500]   We're in a cambrian explosion point. I really feel that
[02:10:26.500 --> 02:10:31.540]   And five or ten years from now. We'll look back and say well, you know, wow, remember we didn't have ai
[02:10:31.540 --> 02:10:34.820]   You know, it'd be like saying remember when we didn't have shoes
[02:10:34.820 --> 02:10:40.580]   Remember at the time before the wheel was invented what a what a time
[02:10:40.580 --> 02:10:43.540]   Not only that, but it's it's just technology this
[02:10:44.020 --> 02:10:50.260]   Specific thing is technology at its best where take something that was available to people with resources and power
[02:10:50.260 --> 02:10:53.300]   The like the daily show and other shows like that
[02:10:53.300 --> 02:10:57.860]   They don't they used to have at the very beginning people watching literally every single
[02:10:57.860 --> 02:10:59.540]   Every single yeah
[02:10:59.540 --> 02:11:03.220]   Now they have now they subscribe to expensive services that will basically
[02:11:03.220 --> 02:11:08.900]   Look at keywords that are spoken during the stuff and that's how harvest they're their clips from now when you say that no now
[02:11:08.900 --> 02:11:13.460]   Anybody who's doing youtube anybody who's doing any sort of reporting can simply say look
[02:11:13.540 --> 02:11:18.740]   I want here is here is the past two days of set of testimony on xyz or here is
[02:11:18.740 --> 02:11:26.500]   More more appropriate local government, which doesn't provide like transcripts necessarily of every single board meeting here
[02:11:26.500 --> 02:11:31.140]   But they might livestream it right great. Let me let me just basically archive every single one of these ever done
[02:11:31.140 --> 02:11:33.300]   So that if I want to find out what's being discussed
[02:11:33.300 --> 02:11:36.100]   I don't have to sit through three hours worth of well
[02:11:36.100 --> 02:11:38.900]   And then you feed it to chat gpt
[02:11:38.900 --> 02:11:42.340]   And you say tell me the five things that happen that I need to know about
[02:11:42.660 --> 02:11:47.620]   I mean summarize this we're gonna get we're gonna get more and more and more as the pile on effect
[02:11:47.620 --> 02:11:52.740]   Transcripts are just the beginning. That's just getting it into a form that the computer could then chew on. I mean we're
[02:11:52.740 --> 02:12:00.020]   We're in a brave new world. You know, yeah, so long so long as copy sir forum traffic is still in the land of ghosts and wins
[02:12:00.020 --> 02:12:06.020]   I'm happy about all of this. You know google already archived all of u-snet posts from when I was in college
[02:12:06.020 --> 02:12:08.100]   So we're gonna work
[02:12:08.100 --> 02:12:09.140]   It's over
[02:12:09.140 --> 02:12:14.980]   Oh those flame wars live on ladies and gentlemen jason snell follow him at six colors
[02:12:14.980 --> 02:12:18.980]   Dot com if you go to six colors.com slash Jason you'll see a
[02:12:18.980 --> 02:12:23.220]   Really rather long list of all the things he does
[02:12:23.220 --> 02:12:27.940]   It's amazing. He finds time to be with us at all. Gotta keep the lights on
[02:12:27.940 --> 02:12:32.420]   He still has time to be in a curling league
[02:12:32.420 --> 02:12:38.740]   So I admire that I admire that. Yeah in fact, let's let's make that my uh
[02:12:39.460 --> 02:12:43.060]   My uh plug of the day, right? How about that the Oakland
[02:12:43.060 --> 02:12:45.540]   curling league
[02:12:45.540 --> 02:12:50.420]   The san francisco bay curling if you're in the bay area you could go out curling is a really fun sport
[02:12:50.420 --> 02:12:53.780]   It doesn't require you to be athletic at all. I do it
[02:12:53.780 --> 02:13:00.980]   It's bay area curling dot com. They have a brand new facility. Are you a sweeper or a pusher? What do you what do you do?
[02:13:00.980 --> 02:13:03.860]   Uh, we do you do all of it you do all of it, right?
[02:13:03.860 --> 02:13:07.060]   You throw the rocks down and then you sweep and then you and the whole thing
[02:13:07.140 --> 02:13:10.420]   It's a lot of fun. They have learned to curls you can come out and check it out
[02:13:10.420 --> 02:13:14.820]   Uh, and if you are in another region that has a especially a dedicated but any curling club
[02:13:14.820 --> 02:13:19.060]   It's a lot of fun. It's like, you know, it's kind of like bowling mixed with chess
[02:13:19.060 --> 02:13:23.860]   It's uh, it's strategy and also physical. It's I think it's actually a really good nerd sport
[02:13:23.860 --> 02:13:30.500]   And uh, you should and it again. It does not require you to be in tip top aerobic, uh, shape which is nice
[02:13:30.500 --> 02:13:32.900]   I'd like it better if it were on ice
[02:13:32.900 --> 02:13:35.620]   Can we do can we have curling on?
[02:13:35.620 --> 02:13:40.260]   No, but you don't put on skates or anything you just wear your sneakers basically
[02:13:40.260 --> 02:13:43.300]   Or if you have special curling shoes. I know they're
[02:13:43.300 --> 02:13:47.140]   I have special curling shoes, but you don't need to have them. You don't have to have them
[02:13:47.140 --> 02:13:53.220]   I like okay can croquet take off sometime soon because that's their same as curling
[02:13:53.220 --> 02:13:55.860]   It's all yes, but it's on the masses croquet
[02:13:55.860 --> 02:14:01.460]   All you all you all anybody with a well blocked straw boater is welcome on any croquet pinch
[02:14:01.460 --> 02:14:06.420]   I was I would say I feel I feel like curling a croquet or or
[02:14:06.420 --> 02:14:13.700]   Sibling sports. I mean they're they're related. They're nerdy. No, it's more curling is a little more like a botchie
[02:14:13.700 --> 02:14:18.660]   I would say or maybe shuffleboard. It's the idea of getting you know, the the ones that are closest to the target
[02:14:18.660 --> 02:14:20.740]   Obviously, you've never really played a lot of croquet
[02:14:20.740 --> 02:14:24.820]   There's a considerable amount of that in croquet except you have mallets
[02:14:24.820 --> 02:14:27.700]   So I and instead of brooms
[02:14:27.700 --> 02:14:32.580]   I just feel there are no there are no hoops to go through in curling although that would be something if there were
[02:14:32.580 --> 02:14:35.220]   They should be curling hoops. Let's invent them
[02:14:35.220 --> 02:14:38.020]   Uh bay area curling.com
[02:14:38.020 --> 02:14:41.060]   Yep, check it out. That's my other pick of the week
[02:14:41.060 --> 02:14:45.620]   Something why into your new obsession. It's awesome
[02:14:45.620 --> 02:14:49.220]   It's a lot. It's looking forward to getting into pickleball, but maybe you know
[02:14:49.220 --> 02:14:52.180]   I'll be curling is is in my future
[02:14:52.820 --> 02:14:57.620]   Uh Jason you need you need to answer the question that everybody wants to know before they're leaving and investigate this
[02:14:57.620 --> 02:15:02.660]   Are you allowed to drink while doing it? Oh, in fact, usually you're encouraged to
[02:15:02.660 --> 02:15:06.900]   It is the national sport of Canada. Do you know anything else?
[02:15:06.900 --> 02:15:09.540]   Yeah, it was invented in Scotland, but it's the national sport of Canada
[02:15:09.540 --> 02:15:11.380]   And so drinking is involved in large parts of it
[02:15:11.380 --> 02:15:15.460]   The most important rule of curling of all the rules of curling is winter buys
[02:15:15.460 --> 02:15:19.940]   Say no more say no more
[02:15:20.980 --> 02:15:23.940]   A wink is as good an odd to a blind man nudge nudge
[02:15:23.940 --> 02:15:30.500]   Thank you, Jason Snell and the anaco tell us about gbh. They dropped the w
[02:15:30.500 --> 02:15:37.220]   Exactly. Well again, we're increasing our bandwidth by 25 by 25 by dropping that unnecessary w
[02:15:37.220 --> 02:15:39.540]   Also think about the number syllables in the w
[02:15:39.540 --> 02:15:46.980]   It's a single letter very much and it has what what double you it has three syllables for one letter
[02:15:48.020 --> 02:15:53.860]   Okay, but also alphabetically that puts us that used to put us at the very very end of the list with g like
[02:15:53.860 --> 02:15:58.500]   We're not being cheeky and making ours like agbh. We're just because we're at the gbh

[02:16:33.460 --> 02:16:37.940]   Alex lindsey of office hours dot global
[02:16:37.940 --> 02:16:39.940]   Hello
[02:16:39.940 --> 02:16:40.660]   What's coming up?
[02:16:40.660 --> 02:16:49.060]   On yesterday. Oh nice. So yesterday morning. We had our second hour rene came on and he dropped the heavy detail of how youtube works
[02:16:49.060 --> 02:16:56.980]   So like it was so just a bunch of q&a so he came on as a his official capacity and uh as the as the liaison as the creator liaison
[02:16:56.980 --> 02:17:00.660]   Nice and we just peppered and we did what we do in office hours, which is what we uh
[02:17:00.660 --> 02:17:07.540]   We peppered him with questions and rene answered them the way you would expect rene to answer them, which is highly detailed at high velocity
[02:17:08.100 --> 02:17:14.580]   It's probably the most dense description of things you need to know about being a youtube creator that i've ever seen so
[02:17:14.580 --> 02:17:20.580]   Oh, that's great. Everybody should watch it. And of course you do put it on youtube. So i'm sure everybody will it's all there
[02:17:20.580 --> 02:17:22.740]   Yeah, today we talked about
[02:17:22.740 --> 02:17:27.300]   Pencils video pencil video pencil. Um, so that's uh, that is a drawing
[02:17:27.300 --> 02:17:32.740]   Drawing app on the ipad so that it does ndi back and forth and you can you can draw on just about anything
[02:17:32.740 --> 02:17:34.980]   So i'll tell us straight a little tell us
[02:17:34.980 --> 02:17:39.780]   Everyone over they got that idea. Yeah. Yeah, I don't use video pencil right now because the way my system is set up
[02:17:39.780 --> 02:17:42.580]   It's set up a different way than the way it's designed to work but uh
[02:17:42.580 --> 02:17:46.180]   Um, but I am looking at it and trying to figure out how to integrate it
[02:17:46.180 --> 02:17:50.180]   So he so michael came on john to toolis who is one of the founders of
[02:17:50.180 --> 02:17:55.060]   Sound devices is going to be on tomorrow. So we're pretty excited to have john and then
[02:17:55.060 --> 02:17:58.020]   And then we've got uh, we're talking about ces on thursday
[02:17:58.020 --> 02:18:01.300]   We decided to let the dust settle on ces and all the other announcements come out
[02:18:01.380 --> 02:18:04.260]   So so thursday we're gonna talk about ces and then friday. We've got
[02:18:04.260 --> 02:18:09.220]   Andy carlucchio and the whole uh, the events team coming on john and sam
[02:18:09.220 --> 02:18:12.660]   Oh, yeah, he's gonna come on and answer quite that just it's just there's nothing new
[02:18:12.660 --> 02:18:15.620]   But just they they come on about once a month to answer questions
[02:18:15.620 --> 02:18:19.620]   So so we have a whole bunch of questions for him and and that will uh, that's what we do
[02:18:19.620 --> 02:18:24.420]   We we ask a lot of questions. So anyway, that's the that's the week. It's not just them you too can

[02:20:53.780 --> 02:20:56.980]   They stick around because their ads work
