[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   We complete you.
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   Oh, Mac Brake.
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   The game of the game of the game of the game of the game of the game of the game of the game of the game.
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   Is that from Jerry Maguire?
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.000]   Yep.
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.000]   Isn't it that?
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   I've always taken it from Austin Powers, many of the game of the game.
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   Which came first.
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   Jerry Maguire was, you had me at hello.
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   You had me at hello is the classic.
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   Yeah.
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   I've never seen the movies where I have never seen the movie, but I know the three catch phrases you're supposed to know from that movie.
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.000]   Show me the money.
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.000]   What?
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   Cuba Goodings.
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   Very, very beautiful.
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   Moving speech.
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   You had me at hello.
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   Yeah.
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   Hey, Zell Wigger.
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   And actually, you'd have to do the entire thing.
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000]   You have to do the entire.
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   You complete me.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   Who said that and when?
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   I'm trying to remember that.
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   No, I just wanted the mini-me one.
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   I only know the mini-me one.
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   You complete me.
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   You complete me.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   You like talking to me.
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   Oh, no, that's from the rap.
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   The rap beat down.
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   You complete me.
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   And the little guy who says the human headway seven pounds.
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   That's another good.
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   That's a great movie now that I think about it.
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   A perfect holiday movie.
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   You know, if in the holidays you're in the mood for one gratuitous crap joke every 2.3 minutes, there you go.
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   That's the show.
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   Christmas vacation to spie me a classic only has one.
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   Yeah.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   And you have to wait until Cous Nettie comes on and empties out this uptick tank.
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   That he's already got there.
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   It just doesn't deliver.
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   Hollywood just does not deliver the way it used to.
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   So apparently it was Renee Zell-Wigger saying it.
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   I remember now she's translating a deaf couple or speaking in the elevator.
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   And she translates you completely.
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   Yeah.
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   You haven't seen that movie.
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   You've got to see that movie.
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   Oh, well, again, romantic comedies.
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   That's exactly what we go.
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   Here we go.
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   Ladies and gentlemen, thanks to YouTube.
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   We know exactly what happened.
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   I should say I'm not religious about not seeing Jerry McGuire.
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   For a charity event to complete a Kickstarter stretch goal, I would see.
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   Just watch this.
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   We work in a business of tough competitors.
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   Tough competitors.
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:03.000]   This is only 50 seconds.
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   I'm going to get to the couple quickly.
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   I love you.
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   Oh, my God.
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   It's you.
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   Oh, Vileo.
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   Completely.
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:15.000]   I'm about to just...
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   ...have...
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   ...just...
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.000]   ...have...
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   ...just...
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:21.000]   ...have...
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:22.000]   ...you had me at hello.
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   Oh, you get two and one.
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   A daily double.
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   Two and one.
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   You see, the thing with Tom Cruise is there's all this gossip, column, entertainment stuff,
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   but he's still actually a very good actor.
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   We tend to forget that.
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.000]   That's the only scene he's ever been a good actor in ever.
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   Oh, no, you're wrong.
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:43.000]   No, that movie where he was the bad guy, the overweight bad guy dancing in the circle.
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000]   Magnolia.
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000]   No, no, no, no, no, he's very good at Magnolia.
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   He was good at Magnolia.
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   He was good at being born on the Fourth of July.
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   I should probably introduce the rest of this cast because we've really gotten around a whole couple of people.
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:55.000]   Oh, God.
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   Exactly.
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   Bonnie Hunt.
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:58.000]   We were about to skip over.
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:59.000]   Bonnie Hunt.
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   That was like...
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   Jerry McGuire had one of the most powerful supporting cast we've ever seen in a movie.
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   If it had had had Jonathan Lipnicki before we fully fell in love with Jonathan Lipnicki.
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:17.000]   If I ever said I would never do a geek culture show, I think I just did.
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:18.000]   Tropic Thunder.
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:19.000]   He was outstanding.
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   Tropic Thunder.
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:21.000]   Tropic Thunder.
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000]   Was he the black guy in Tropic Thunder?
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   No, he was the guy behind the scenes with the bald guy who was just dancing and being a bald guy.
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   Disgusting guy with a monkey.
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:31.000]   Yes.
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   Renee Richie is here from Leimortec.
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:34.000]   Tropic Thunder.
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:35.000]   Terrible movie.
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   Terrible movie.
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:37.000]   Great premise.
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:38.000]   Brilliant premise.
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:39.000]   Should have been brilliant.
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:40.000]   Great Tom Cruise performance.
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:41.000]   Nothing else.
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:42.000]   Yeah.
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:43.000]   And also all the way over there.
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   Mac OS Ken Ray.
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.000]   Happy newlywed Ken Ray.
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   Congratulations.
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000]   Sounds like you're giving me one.
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:51.000]   Thank you.
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:55.000]   It's the newlywed show.
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:02.000]   See, this is the payoff for all of our regular lives.
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:07.000]   I mean, July, August, September, they're thinking, you know, I'm really wanted to tune in.
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   This is here.
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000]   Pop culture references and discussions about movies.
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000]   And then their friends said, don't worry.
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:16.000]   They'll get to it in December when there's absolutely no news and they need to fill an hour.
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:17.000]   No back news.
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:23.000]   Wait until there's no more Mac rumors, no more iPhone releases, no more iPads, no more legal stuff.
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:28.000]   Then they'll start saying, but the thing with Gene Hackman is when we saw him and Bonnie
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:33.000]   and Clyde, he didn't have that sort of on screen experience that he would exhibit later
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:34.000]   on.
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:35.000]   And, you know, like a movie like Heist.
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   Now it's David Mamet.
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:37.000]   I know.
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:41.000]   So you have to sort of get around the fact that's a very dialogue-y sort of picture.
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:46.000]   But still, the fact that he's using the times between his lines, Gene Hackman, in order to
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   really shape the -- how do we do?
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:49.000]   Another 90 seconds.
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000]   See, if you're going to do this --
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   I'll try to fix the week.
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   If you're going to do this, I have to take issue with something you said a minute ago.
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:02.000]   There are actually two fantastic crap jokes in National Lampoon's Christmas vacation.
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   What kind of jokes?
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:05.000]   Crap jokes?
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:06.000]   Crap.
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:07.000]   I know.
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:10.000]   So we got the one of Cousin Eddie emptying the RV septic tank into the store.
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:11.000]   Oh, yeah.
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:12.000]   That's a classic.
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:13.000]   Yeah.
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:14.000]   Yeah.
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:15.000]   I could ever forget.
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.000]   My favorite one, though, is when a little kid is talking to Clark about the fact that her
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:21.000]   brother is concerned that since they're not home, Santa Claus is not going to know where
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:22.000]   they are.
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:25.000]   And she says, "Hims, hmm, hmm, bricks."
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:26.000]   Okay.
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.000]   Okay, Clark says, "I don't think you should be talking that way."
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000]   And she's like, "Oh, I'm sorry.
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.000]   Hm, hmm, rocks."
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:34.000]   That's --
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:39.000]   Ken -- Ken Ray has something new that he wants us to mention, by the way.
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.000]   You're doing something on newsstand.
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:44.000]   I am, because it seems like you have to now, doesn't it?
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.000]   Everybody's got to do it.
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:51.000]   So I've been writing a daily Apple News podcast for the past seven and a half years.
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.000]   Close to eight, it'll be eight in January.
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:57.400]   And it's always kind of bothered me that once the newscast is done, it's just done.
[00:07:57.400 --> 00:08:01.800]   There's all this content that I'm producing the people listen to, and they like it, and
[00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:03.400]   I really love that.
[00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:06.320]   But then there's -- you know, I felt like there should be something more that I could do with
[00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:07.720]   the content that I was producing.
[00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:13.320]   So I've started in -- I have a magazine for a newsstand called iChart.
[00:08:13.320 --> 00:08:15.960]   That's E-Y-E iChart magazine.
[00:08:15.960 --> 00:08:22.520]   $4.99 is a free trial on newsstand, if you want to try it out.
[00:08:22.520 --> 00:08:25.200]   And yeah, it's a daily read.
[00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:29.920]   It's basically the same thing that I'm doing with the podcast, but you can go back and
[00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:33.960]   reference it, and there are pictures, and there'll be more content as it goes right
[00:08:33.960 --> 00:08:34.960]   now.
[00:08:34.960 --> 00:08:39.400]   It's just sort of -- it is repurposing and, you know, providing links and stuff like that.
[00:08:39.400 --> 00:08:41.400]   Think of it as -- there it is.
[00:08:41.400 --> 00:08:42.400]   I think it is like --
[00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:43.400]   That's a neat thing.
[00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:45.160]   But it's text, right?
[00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:46.160]   It's text.
[00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:48.440]   Yeah, if you scroll through there, yeah, there you go.
[00:08:48.440 --> 00:08:49.760]   Now why newsstand?
[00:08:49.760 --> 00:08:55.080]   Because we've talked before about Marco Arment and others just railing.
[00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:59.760]   That newsstand is no longer -- there's no reason to be in newsstand anymore.
[00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:00.760]   Hmm.
[00:09:00.760 --> 00:09:01.760]   [laughter]
[00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:02.760]   Hmm.
[00:09:02.760 --> 00:09:03.760]   You're right.
[00:09:03.760 --> 00:09:04.760]   I'm done.
[00:09:04.760 --> 00:09:06.760]   It was a time to come to me.
[00:09:06.760 --> 00:09:12.040]   When you put some people's boats, do you like to use an all or like a powerful to do
[00:09:12.040 --> 00:09:13.040]   that?
[00:09:13.040 --> 00:09:15.840]   There's another great crab joke up now, sorry.
[00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:16.840]   Why newsstand?
[00:09:16.840 --> 00:09:23.280]   No, actually, no, no, I'm hoping that you will be -- provide the, you know, other -- so,
[00:09:23.280 --> 00:09:27.160]   Marco says newsstand -- he does something in newsstand called the magazine.
[00:09:27.160 --> 00:09:29.920]   He says newsstand sucks in iOS.
[00:09:29.920 --> 00:09:35.240]   The other thing is, you know, that frankly, because you could have auto-renewing subscriptions
[00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:36.440]   in any app now.
[00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:38.800]   Yeah, it's post-IOS 7 newsstand.
[00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:40.680]   Yeah, that's not that newsstand sucks.
[00:09:40.680 --> 00:09:44.640]   But once iOS 7 came out, it seemed like they didn't have any real advantage.
[00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:47.640]   Yeah, they gave all the things that used to be exclusive to newsstand where the auto-renewing
[00:09:47.640 --> 00:09:51.920]   subscriptions that you could change the cover art on the actual cover.
[00:09:51.920 --> 00:09:54.720]   And that newsstand was a folder, not an app, so people could always see there was something
[00:09:54.720 --> 00:09:57.160]   new in there and be inclined to go into it.
[00:09:57.160 --> 00:09:59.480]   And you couldn't hide it away because it was a default app.
[00:09:59.480 --> 00:10:00.480]   Right.
[00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:02.360]   Post-IOS 7, everyone gets the auto download.
[00:10:02.360 --> 00:10:04.000]   Everyone gets auto-renew subscription.
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:08.360]   You don't get cover art, but because newsstand acts more like an app and people can hide it,
[00:10:08.360 --> 00:10:10.440]   you don't get the advantage of discoverability either.
[00:10:10.440 --> 00:10:14.520]   And it's bad enough that you can't even spotlight search for newsstand once you do hide it.
[00:10:14.520 --> 00:10:16.520]   So it's possible to lose it forever.
[00:10:16.520 --> 00:10:23.000]   He also says, "Background downloads and silent content available push notifications that
[00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:27.120]   were only available in newsstand apps prior to iOS 7 are available to all apps."
[00:10:27.120 --> 00:10:34.640]   And the new NSURL session, "Background download system is better than newsstands old NK asset
[00:10:34.640 --> 00:10:35.640]   download system."
[00:10:35.640 --> 00:10:36.640]   And you can't change.
[00:10:36.640 --> 00:10:41.480]   Once you're in newsstand, if you change to a normal app, you lose your existing subscriptions.
[00:10:41.480 --> 00:10:44.920]   So now you feel always can.
[00:10:44.920 --> 00:10:47.640]   Honestly, there are a couple of things I'll say.
[00:10:47.640 --> 00:10:53.000]   This is an idea that started, I want to say, actually in May of 2012.
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:57.080]   And initially, my thinking was, "I can, you know, I'll do this and it'll be great."
[00:10:57.080 --> 00:10:59.920]   And so I talked to a friend of mine about building me an app for it.
[00:10:59.920 --> 00:11:02.440]   And at the time, so at the time we're in what?
[00:11:02.440 --> 00:11:03.440]   iOS 5.
[00:11:03.440 --> 00:11:04.440]   Yeah, you're still in 6.
[00:11:04.440 --> 00:11:05.440]   5?
[00:11:05.440 --> 00:11:06.840]   No, we're still in 5 at that point.
[00:11:06.840 --> 00:11:09.120]   In May of 2012, we're still in 5.
[00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:14.800]   So he starts looking around for different possible solutions and decides for him it wouldn't be
[00:11:14.800 --> 00:11:18.440]   worth it to write the app because he and I would be doing this sort of not quite pro
[00:11:18.440 --> 00:11:21.040]   bono, but he'd be basically doing it for his cost.
[00:11:21.040 --> 00:11:23.840]   And he figured he would not be able to turn it back around and do something else.
[00:11:23.840 --> 00:11:24.840]   Right.
[00:11:24.840 --> 00:11:25.840]   So at that point, I kind of shelved the idea.
[00:11:25.840 --> 00:11:28.840]   I started doing some of the daily work that I will be doing, but I sort of shelved the
[00:11:28.840 --> 00:11:29.840]   idea.
[00:11:29.840 --> 00:11:34.200]   But I'm still looking around for different possibilities.
[00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:38.880]   It was when Don McAllister started screencasts online that looked into his thing.
[00:11:38.880 --> 00:11:44.240]   And what he was using was something called "Madcast," which I'm using now.
[00:11:44.240 --> 00:11:47.000]   And they, I mean, I think they're working on something for Android.
[00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:48.160]   Right now they are iOS.
[00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:51.640]   But the other reason honestly is my show is Mac OS can.
[00:11:51.640 --> 00:11:56.560]   And I figure that's probably people who are going to be most interested in that are going
[00:11:56.560 --> 00:11:58.240]   to be in the iOS ecosystem anyway.
[00:11:58.240 --> 00:11:59.640]   Well, that's for sure.
[00:11:59.640 --> 00:12:00.640]   That's for sure.
[00:12:00.640 --> 00:12:01.640]   It's just a question of whether it should be in that.
[00:12:01.640 --> 00:12:02.640]   And you have an app anyway.
[00:12:02.640 --> 00:12:04.800]   You have another app, don't you?
[00:12:04.800 --> 00:12:05.800]   I do.
[00:12:05.800 --> 00:12:06.800]   Yes.
[00:12:06.800 --> 00:12:09.600]   That was actually built by Libson or by Wizard Media.
[00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:10.600]   Oh, OK.
[00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:12.080]   The podcast app is from Wizard.
[00:12:12.080 --> 00:12:13.080]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:12:13.080 --> 00:12:14.400]   Yeah, the podcast app is from them.
[00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:24.080]   So basically you're looking at like a year and a half of working on it up until it launched,
[00:12:24.080 --> 00:12:25.560]   I guess, in the middle of October.
[00:12:25.560 --> 00:12:30.920]   I think the things Marco is talking about aren't significant from your point of view.
[00:12:30.920 --> 00:12:31.920]   Probably not from mine, no.
[00:12:31.920 --> 00:12:32.920]   Yeah.
[00:12:32.920 --> 00:12:36.080]   I mean, and you know, who knows what it's going to be six months or a year from now?
[00:12:36.080 --> 00:12:40.960]   I mean, I am kind of intrigued by the idea that the podcast seems to be working on an
[00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:41.960]   Android thing.
[00:12:41.960 --> 00:12:42.960]   I hope I've got that right.
[00:12:42.960 --> 00:12:43.960]   I hope I'm not saying anything.
[00:12:43.960 --> 00:12:45.920]   I'm not supposed to say out loud.
[00:12:45.920 --> 00:12:49.320]   It seems like I read that someplace, but I'm not 100% certain.
[00:12:49.320 --> 00:12:51.320]   I may end up adding to that as well.
[00:12:51.320 --> 00:12:53.000]   But as it stands right now, it's--
[00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:56.920]   Yeah, because a lot of us Macintosh users are Android users.
[00:12:56.920 --> 00:13:00.400]   It doesn't necessarily follow that you have to use an iPhone if you use a Mac.
[00:13:00.400 --> 00:13:01.400]   No, for sure.
[00:13:01.400 --> 00:13:03.280]   Well, I mean, there have already been some changes to it.
[00:13:03.280 --> 00:13:07.280]   Initially, I thought it was just going to be an iPad-only thing because I like the way
[00:13:07.280 --> 00:13:09.080]   it looks on the iPad.
[00:13:09.080 --> 00:13:12.920]   And then immediately got some emails from people saying, yeah, I only read stuff on
[00:13:12.920 --> 00:13:13.920]   my phone.
[00:13:13.920 --> 00:13:15.800]   Like, you know, they read it on their way to work or something like that.
[00:13:15.800 --> 00:13:23.040]   And so they hated the first week of it because it was just a gigantic iPad screen that you
[00:13:23.040 --> 00:13:26.240]   had to, you know, mention to them and book around and move through on the iPhone, which
[00:13:26.240 --> 00:13:28.240]   is sort of terrible.
[00:13:28.240 --> 00:13:32.120]   Remember how neat we thought that was when it first came out?
[00:13:32.120 --> 00:13:34.520]   The time seemed like a good idea.
[00:13:34.520 --> 00:13:35.520]   The time.
[00:13:35.520 --> 00:13:37.160]   Zoom all the way into this website.
[00:13:37.160 --> 00:13:40.240]   Now we go to a website where you have to zoom in and you're like, sucks.
[00:13:40.240 --> 00:13:41.200]   Go on to something else.
[00:13:41.200 --> 00:13:45.720]   That's by the way, not an insignificant point.
[00:13:45.720 --> 00:13:47.560]   The ground is constantly moving.
[00:13:47.560 --> 00:13:53.240]   Yeah, no, there was a story that I did on today's edition of Mac OS-Ken that was, oh,
[00:13:53.240 --> 00:13:54.240]   who is it?
[00:13:54.240 --> 00:13:55.240]   Branding Brand.
[00:13:55.240 --> 00:13:57.000]   I love their name.
[00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:02.080]   Branding Brand is this company that does mobile applications for retailers.
[00:14:02.080 --> 00:14:03.080]   So it's a lot of people.
[00:14:03.080 --> 00:14:07.960]   It's like Kate Spade and Dick's Sporting Goods and Ace Hardware.
[00:14:07.960 --> 00:14:10.600]   And I can't remember all the other ones, but they've got like 200 that they're doing.
[00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:16.680]   And they say that the spending on sites that are optimized for mobile increased something
[00:14:16.680 --> 00:14:20.200]   like 170 something percent this year.
[00:14:20.200 --> 00:14:26.760]   It's worth remembering that they also, you know, build mobile applications or mobile
[00:14:26.760 --> 00:14:27.760]   websites.
[00:14:27.760 --> 00:14:29.120]   So I mean, they've got a vested interest in it.
[00:14:29.120 --> 00:14:32.040]   And at the same time, they're dealing with a whole lot of big companies that are saying
[00:14:32.040 --> 00:14:33.040]   that's...
[00:14:33.040 --> 00:14:37.920]   Yeah, this is the story on smartphone optimized sites.
[00:14:37.920 --> 00:14:41.800]   Smart phone optimized sites, Black Friday sales were up 187 percent.
[00:14:41.800 --> 00:14:47.800]   Thanksgiving sales up, 258 percent over last year.
[00:14:47.800 --> 00:14:48.800]   Everything's moving to mobile.
[00:14:48.800 --> 00:14:55.080]   I just saw stats about Twitter and Facebook and their age demographics and significantly
[00:14:55.080 --> 00:14:57.640]   a larger portion of young people are using it in mobile.
[00:14:57.640 --> 00:14:58.640]   Mobile's the future.
[00:14:58.640 --> 00:15:00.920]   Yeah, it's also the same as the old copper story, right?
[00:15:00.920 --> 00:15:03.680]   When you couldn't put copper line down, but these countries could go immediately to mobile
[00:15:03.680 --> 00:15:04.680]   technology.
[00:15:04.680 --> 00:15:05.880]   Now you can't afford a computer.
[00:15:05.880 --> 00:15:08.000]   You can still your first computer is now a mobile device.
[00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:09.600]   And a pretty darn good one.
[00:15:09.600 --> 00:15:10.760]   I did a story on Twitter.
[00:15:10.760 --> 00:15:18.840]   I thought it was really fun about when the total computer power in the world matched that
[00:15:18.840 --> 00:15:20.720]   of an iPhone 5 in your pocket.
[00:15:20.720 --> 00:15:24.760]   And it was sometime between 1964 and 1969.
[00:15:24.760 --> 00:15:29.520]   Up before that point, the total world computing power was less than one iPhone 5.
[00:15:29.520 --> 00:15:33.720]   My father was an engineer at IBM in the 60s and 70s and he came in one day with a terabyte
[00:15:33.720 --> 00:15:37.000]   hard drive and he said, "Do you know that we couldn't store this much in cities?"
[00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:38.000]   Yeah.
[00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:39.000]   Just a few years ago.
[00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:40.000]   Yeah.
[00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:43.080]   That's what's wonderful about this business action.
[00:15:43.080 --> 00:15:44.720]   Hey, I want to take a break.
[00:15:44.720 --> 00:15:45.720]   I'm just making an old man.
[00:15:45.720 --> 00:15:46.720]   Can I just mention the...
[00:15:46.720 --> 00:15:47.720]   I'm sorry.
[00:15:47.720 --> 00:15:48.720]   Go ahead, I'm sorry.
[00:15:48.720 --> 00:15:51.400]   I was going to say the thing from Marco, just to be fair to Marco, that was based on an
[00:15:51.400 --> 00:15:53.480]   article in Pando Daily by Hamish Mackenzie.
[00:15:53.480 --> 00:15:56.480]   He was talking to Glenn Fleischman, the new owner of the magazine.
[00:15:56.480 --> 00:15:59.920]   And he was saying that discoverability is way down in iOS 7 and that's what hurts him.
[00:15:59.920 --> 00:16:02.360]   It's not Glenn Fleischman owns the magazine.
[00:16:02.360 --> 00:16:03.360]   Yeah, Marco sold everything.
[00:16:03.360 --> 00:16:04.360]   He sold everything.
[00:16:04.360 --> 00:16:07.640]   He sold everything and he's working on a podcast client now.
[00:16:07.640 --> 00:16:09.800]   And Glenn Fleischman was the one who joined an ashram.
[00:16:09.800 --> 00:16:10.800]   Wow.
[00:16:10.800 --> 00:16:14.440]   Well, that's what he made a lot of money on Instapaper, right?
[00:16:14.440 --> 00:16:15.440]   And Tumblr.
[00:16:15.440 --> 00:16:16.440]   The Tumblr.
[00:16:16.440 --> 00:16:17.440]   And Tumblr.
[00:16:17.440 --> 00:16:18.440]   He was the first programmer at Tumblr.
[00:16:18.440 --> 00:16:20.240]   The second and the second employee.
[00:16:20.240 --> 00:16:21.240]   So that's right.
[00:16:21.240 --> 00:16:25.440]   He's just like it on his yacht, writing a podcast app because God knows when I retire, that's
[00:16:25.440 --> 00:16:26.440]   what I want to do.
[00:16:26.440 --> 00:16:28.720]   If I could write a podcast client, I would.
[00:16:28.720 --> 00:16:29.720]   I don't know.
[00:16:29.720 --> 00:16:32.960]   I had so much respect for those decisions.
[00:16:32.960 --> 00:16:33.960]   It just seemed...
[00:16:33.960 --> 00:16:35.480]   I don't know him that well myself.
[00:16:35.480 --> 00:16:38.240]   But from what he was talking about and what he's talked about those decisions since, it
[00:16:38.240 --> 00:16:43.240]   really just seemed like I broke these apps because I wanted to do certain things.
[00:16:43.240 --> 00:16:44.840]   I think I've done those things with them.
[00:16:44.840 --> 00:16:45.840]   It's time to...
[00:16:45.840 --> 00:16:46.840]   And he didn't...
[00:16:46.840 --> 00:16:50.160]   Unlike so many other developers where they lose interest and drift away, he made sure
[00:16:50.160 --> 00:16:53.960]   that he took his kid and said, "Well, here, I can't take care of this kid.
[00:16:53.960 --> 00:16:55.680]   I don't want to take care of this kid anymore.
[00:16:55.680 --> 00:16:56.680]   Here, you love it."
[00:16:56.680 --> 00:17:00.560]   And so he sold Instapaper and he sold the magazine to people who are continuing to do
[00:17:00.560 --> 00:17:01.560]   great things with it.
[00:17:01.560 --> 00:17:03.040]   And he followed his bliss, which is nice.
[00:17:03.040 --> 00:17:04.040]   Exactly.
[00:17:04.040 --> 00:17:05.040]   Great move, great move.
[00:17:05.040 --> 00:17:06.040]   God bless him.
[00:17:06.040 --> 00:17:07.040]   Everyone.
[00:17:07.040 --> 00:17:08.040]   Everyone.
[00:17:08.040 --> 00:17:09.040]   It's December.
[00:17:09.040 --> 00:17:10.040]   I'm sorry.
[00:17:10.040 --> 00:17:11.280]   By the way, you must have seen...
[00:17:11.280 --> 00:17:19.640]   I'm going to make a wild guess here that Andy Enoco recently saw a movie.
[00:17:19.640 --> 00:17:20.640]   What was the name of that?
[00:17:20.640 --> 00:17:22.120]   We had the guy on who did it.
[00:17:22.120 --> 00:17:25.560]   Oh yeah, it was the guy who found a tricaster.
[00:17:25.560 --> 00:17:26.560]   Tim's Vermeer.
[00:17:26.560 --> 00:17:27.560]   Tim's Vermeer.
[00:17:27.560 --> 00:17:28.880]   Did you just see Tim's Vermeer?
[00:17:28.880 --> 00:17:34.760]   No, what I did was I heard your incredibly cool triangulation interview of him.
[00:17:34.760 --> 00:17:35.760]   I heard about...
[00:17:35.760 --> 00:17:38.600]   I'm a pen and teller fan, so I'd heard about this documentary.
[00:17:38.600 --> 00:17:39.600]   Pen...
[00:17:39.600 --> 00:17:41.720]   Teller produced it, right?
[00:17:41.720 --> 00:17:42.720]   Right.
[00:17:42.720 --> 00:17:45.000]   Teller directed it, pen and teller produced it.
[00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:46.000]   Right.
[00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:47.000]   The guy who...
[00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:49.400]   You know, so many people I think know the story.
[00:17:49.400 --> 00:17:50.400]   The guy who invented...
[00:17:50.400 --> 00:17:57.440]   Rather started the video toaster, now makes the company, thanks a tricaster, had a brain
[00:17:57.440 --> 00:17:58.440]   and a suit.
[00:17:58.440 --> 00:18:01.920]   Tim's a wonderful guy, by the way, the sweetest guy ever.
[00:18:01.920 --> 00:18:09.520]   So the basic story is that he had this brain wave about how a lot of these old masters
[00:18:09.520 --> 00:18:11.800]   might have painted, that they might have used technology.
[00:18:11.800 --> 00:18:15.960]   It was just simply like, hold up your thumb like this and paint what you see it was lenses
[00:18:15.960 --> 00:18:22.720]   and mirrors that allow them to really closely translate not only the shapes and lines, but
[00:18:22.720 --> 00:18:24.680]   also the tones and the colors.
[00:18:24.680 --> 00:18:27.200]   And as an experiment decided, okay, let's...
[00:18:27.200 --> 00:18:31.280]   A small experiment worked out great, so he said, okay, I've got the money.
[00:18:31.280 --> 00:18:37.000]   I've got lots of money, so I'm going to build an exact reproduction of the room that a famous
[00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:38.960]   old master painting was set in.
[00:18:38.960 --> 00:18:44.840]   So he built this room, bought the harpsichord, had like all these props made specifically
[00:18:44.840 --> 00:18:50.120]   to match exactly the painting, and then spent with no art training whatsoever, set down
[00:18:50.120 --> 00:18:51.120]   to duplicate it.
[00:18:51.120 --> 00:18:55.000]   So the quick answer to your question was that I haven't seen the movie yet, I'm really
[00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:56.680]   excited to see it.
[00:18:56.680 --> 00:18:58.200]   Vanity Fair, I think, had a longer...
[00:18:58.200 --> 00:19:06.000]   Now that it's debuting in New York and LA to make it eligible for Academy Award nominations
[00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:07.320]   next year.
[00:19:07.320 --> 00:19:10.760]   So now I've always looking about, I want to see the painting, I want to see the painting,
[00:19:10.760 --> 00:19:14.440]   and the Vanity Fair had this huge, huge scan of the painting.
[00:19:14.440 --> 00:19:18.560]   And I'm like, oh my God, this is just the guy who did lecture.
[00:19:18.560 --> 00:19:21.800]   So that's what's interesting, is that the original Vermeer on your screen, or is that
[00:19:21.800 --> 00:19:23.120]   Tim's Vermeer?
[00:19:23.120 --> 00:19:24.280]   That's Tim's Vermeer.
[00:19:24.280 --> 00:19:28.880]   And it's apparently indistinguishable from the original.
[00:19:28.880 --> 00:19:31.600]   You can tell the difference between the two, obviously, because there are minute differences,
[00:19:31.600 --> 00:19:37.720]   but if you did not see the two labeled side by side, you would not know that this was
[00:19:37.720 --> 00:19:38.720]   painted by...
[00:19:38.720 --> 00:19:42.640]   This is painted by a legitimate old master, and this painting has worth tens of millions
[00:19:42.640 --> 00:19:45.680]   of dollars on its own by the British royal family.
[00:19:45.680 --> 00:19:49.560]   This one was designed by a guy who made some money in electronics and had him pick up a
[00:19:49.560 --> 00:19:52.520]   brunch, hadn't really picked up a brush before.
[00:19:52.520 --> 00:19:54.200]   This is his second painting.
[00:19:54.200 --> 00:19:55.520]   The first one in color.
[00:19:55.520 --> 00:19:56.520]   Yeah.
[00:19:56.520 --> 00:19:57.520]   Oh, yeah.
[00:19:57.520 --> 00:19:58.520]   He had no experience.
[00:19:58.520 --> 00:19:59.520]   He had no experience.
[00:19:59.520 --> 00:20:01.960]   He thought it was something with these lenses and mirrors idea.
[00:20:01.960 --> 00:20:02.960]   It's just fascinating.
[00:20:02.960 --> 00:20:07.560]   David Hockney was the first to presume that Vermeer made have used some sort of optical
[00:20:07.560 --> 00:20:12.160]   technology to do it, because it really was a breakthrough in the use of photorealism
[00:20:12.160 --> 00:20:13.400]   in that era.
[00:20:13.400 --> 00:20:19.160]   If you want to see the interview, it's from a triangulation episode 118, and Tim Jenison
[00:20:19.160 --> 00:20:21.880]   is just the greatest guy anyway.
[00:20:21.880 --> 00:20:24.120]   But what a story that is, and I'm glad the movie...
[00:20:24.120 --> 00:20:25.120]   I haven't seen the movie either.
[00:20:25.120 --> 00:20:26.120]   I haven't seen it yet.
[00:20:26.120 --> 00:20:27.120]   I've seen it yet.
[00:20:27.120 --> 00:20:29.520]   As soon as it's available, I want to see it.
[00:20:29.520 --> 00:20:34.240]   Of course, there's a lot of controversy about the art historian saying, "Oh, how droll for
[00:20:34.240 --> 00:20:39.600]   you to say that these painters weren't talented, and it's all just an artifice that they had."
[00:20:39.600 --> 00:20:41.440]   And I'm like, "No, this is awesome."
[00:20:41.440 --> 00:20:42.920]   Vermeer was a geek.
[00:20:42.920 --> 00:20:44.920]   He was like, "I want to develop a...
[00:20:44.920 --> 00:20:47.360]   I can't draw as well as I want to draw.
[00:20:47.360 --> 00:20:52.960]   I bet that I can develop a gadget that will let me compose the..."
[00:20:52.960 --> 00:20:56.560]   He was a photographer before there was technology for photography.
[00:20:56.560 --> 00:21:00.920]   He was a digital artist before there was the technology for Photoshop.
[00:21:00.920 --> 00:21:04.440]   And he said, "I bet with lenses and mirrors I can make up for what I...
[00:21:04.440 --> 00:21:05.840]   I'm not painting the way I want to paint.
[00:21:05.840 --> 00:21:06.840]   I bet I can...
[00:21:06.840 --> 00:21:07.840]   Oh, God.
[00:21:07.840 --> 00:21:08.840]   What a great...
[00:21:08.840 --> 00:21:09.360]   Isn't that awesome?
[00:21:09.360 --> 00:21:12.400]   I can't see the original painting unless you're a friend of the Queen of England because it's
[00:21:12.400 --> 00:21:14.960]   in Buckingham Palace.
[00:21:14.960 --> 00:21:18.040]   And Tim Jennison has never seen it in person.
[00:21:18.040 --> 00:21:19.680]   No, I think he did.
[00:21:19.680 --> 00:21:20.680]   Maybe he did.
[00:21:20.680 --> 00:21:21.680]   Maybe he did.
[00:21:21.680 --> 00:21:22.680]   And he's able to...
[00:21:22.680 --> 00:21:27.960]   In some of the interviews he talks about, the first time he was able to see it up close
[00:21:27.960 --> 00:21:33.360]   instead of with a digital reproduction or printed reproduction, he was like, "Oh my God,
[00:21:33.360 --> 00:21:38.600]   it's even five times more optically lit details."
[00:21:38.600 --> 00:21:42.080]   It's an optical reproduction even ten times more intensely than I imagine it was.
[00:21:42.080 --> 00:21:43.400]   I had no idea.
[00:21:43.400 --> 00:21:46.080]   Now I'm even doubly sure that this is how he did this.
[00:21:46.080 --> 00:21:50.880]   Yeah, like Grace, the very grace of Her Majesty, the Queen of Canada he was able to.
[00:21:50.880 --> 00:21:53.120]   Let's make sure everybody understands.
[00:21:53.120 --> 00:21:54.120]   That's the Queen of Canada.
[00:21:54.120 --> 00:21:55.120]   Yes.
[00:21:55.120 --> 00:21:56.120]   That's the Queen of Canada.
[00:21:56.120 --> 00:21:57.120]   Yes.
[00:21:57.120 --> 00:21:58.120]   That's the Queen of Canada.
[00:21:58.120 --> 00:21:59.120]   Yes.
[00:21:59.120 --> 00:22:00.120]   But he said the detail was fantastic.
[00:22:00.120 --> 00:22:01.120]   You're seeing it in person.
[00:22:01.120 --> 00:22:02.880]   You're right now I remember that because he did talk about that a little bit.
[00:22:02.880 --> 00:22:05.240]   Little strings and things that he could make it out.
[00:22:05.240 --> 00:22:06.240]   Yeah.
[00:22:06.240 --> 00:22:08.560]   See, the reproductions, none of them do it justice.
[00:22:08.560 --> 00:22:09.560]   Maybe Tim's.
[00:22:09.560 --> 00:22:12.080]   We're going to take a break, come back with more.
[00:22:12.080 --> 00:22:13.080]   We do have some news.
[00:22:13.080 --> 00:22:17.680]   In fact, I want to find out about the Mac Pro and this guy over here, Mr. Renee Richie,
[00:22:17.680 --> 00:22:19.520]   seems to know a little bit about it.
[00:22:19.520 --> 00:22:20.760]   We'll see.
[00:22:20.760 --> 00:22:23.720]   But first a word from our friends at Shutterstock.com.
[00:22:23.720 --> 00:22:25.840]   Shutterstock is a great place to go.
[00:22:25.840 --> 00:22:31.600]   If you need royalty free images, you'll find the perfect image or video for your next creative
[00:22:31.600 --> 00:22:39.080]   project for a website, for a publication, an advertisement, a video, PowerPoint presentation,
[00:22:39.080 --> 00:22:42.880]   keynote presentation, a menu, visit Shutterstock.com.
[00:22:42.880 --> 00:22:46.800]   You could choose from the latest count and they always put this at the bottom.
[00:22:46.800 --> 00:22:52.040]   31,535,435 royalty free images.
[00:22:52.040 --> 00:22:57.960]   With 185,000 added this week alone, don't forget to click the footage tab up at the top
[00:22:57.960 --> 00:23:02.400]   of the Shutterstock.com page to see some of the most beautiful HD footage.
[00:23:02.400 --> 00:23:09.200]   Professional photographers, videographers, really high quality stuff, carefully curated
[00:23:09.200 --> 00:23:12.280]   and a search engine that is second to none.
[00:23:12.280 --> 00:23:17.280]   It's funny because we're used to Google, which is good, but a lot of the search engines you
[00:23:17.280 --> 00:23:20.200]   find in a lot of sites are terrible.
[00:23:20.200 --> 00:23:21.200]   Are terrible.
[00:23:21.200 --> 00:23:24.760]   Shutterstock really puts some energy into not only being able to search for a thing, a
[00:23:24.760 --> 00:23:30.400]   sound, but adding adjectives to have a spectrum color wheel that lets you choose so it fits
[00:23:30.400 --> 00:23:33.440]   the palette of the page that you need.
[00:23:33.440 --> 00:23:35.160]   If you've seen their iPad app, it is.
[00:23:35.160 --> 00:23:37.480]   In fact, if you haven't downloaded it, it's free.
[00:23:37.480 --> 00:23:39.480]   Just gorgeous, Webby award winning.
[00:23:39.480 --> 00:23:40.480]   Shutterstock.com.
[00:23:40.480 --> 00:23:43.200]   Now, here's the call to action.
[00:23:43.200 --> 00:23:44.480]   A couple of things I want you to do.
[00:23:44.480 --> 00:23:46.760]   First of all, do create an account there.
[00:23:46.760 --> 00:23:47.760]   It's free.
[00:23:47.760 --> 00:23:48.760]   You don't have to give them a credit card.
[00:23:48.760 --> 00:23:53.080]   Once you have an account, you can use the light box feature, which means you can save images
[00:23:53.080 --> 00:23:57.760]   just onto a light box as you see them, which is great for later if you want to buy them
[00:23:57.760 --> 00:24:03.040]   or just even inspiration or sharing with another designer or you're working with a
[00:24:03.040 --> 00:24:04.040]   designer.
[00:24:04.040 --> 00:24:05.040]   I have some ideas.
[00:24:05.040 --> 00:24:06.720]   This is in that ballpark.
[00:24:06.720 --> 00:24:07.720]   Use Shutterstock.
[00:24:07.720 --> 00:24:08.960]   I encourage you to do that.
[00:24:08.960 --> 00:24:14.560]   If you do decide you want to buy, you'll get 25% off your first purchase on a new account
[00:24:14.560 --> 00:24:21.400]   when you use our offer code MACBreak1213 for its December 2013, of course.
[00:24:21.400 --> 00:24:27.840]   We have the subscription, which is the best deal, 25 images a day, and 25% off that is
[00:24:27.840 --> 00:24:30.040]   a really, really good deal.
[00:24:30.040 --> 00:24:34.040]   MACBreak1213, but you can buy individual image packs as well.
[00:24:34.040 --> 00:24:40.120]   MACBreak1213 to save 25% at Shutterstock.com.
[00:24:40.120 --> 00:24:46.320]   I'd like you to consider them for your stock image needs.
[00:24:46.320 --> 00:24:51.000]   So I saw you in the chat room say we will definitely have a MACPro by the end of the
[00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:52.000]   year.
[00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:53.000]   Well, Apple said it first.
[00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:54.000]   Yes, they said December.
[00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:55.000]   Yes, absolutely.
[00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:57.880]   But is that December 4th or is it December 31st?
[00:24:57.880 --> 00:25:01.680]   The only thing I've heard is that like the Retina iPad Mini is that they will get them
[00:25:01.680 --> 00:25:04.040]   out as absolutely soon as their production was and together.
[00:25:04.040 --> 00:25:06.000]   And they surprise us with the Retina Mini, right?
[00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:07.880]   So it's just a matter of getting them on the trucks, getting them to the stores and
[00:25:07.880 --> 00:25:09.880]   selling them and putting them online.
[00:25:09.880 --> 00:25:13.600]   Now we thought the MAC, the Retina Mini would be in great short supply.
[00:25:13.600 --> 00:25:16.400]   That actually hasn't turned out to be so much the case.
[00:25:16.400 --> 00:25:17.400]   It's not what they want.
[00:25:17.400 --> 00:25:19.880]   It's not like you can go into a store and have tons and tons of iPad errors.
[00:25:19.880 --> 00:25:23.200]   Like the first day for an Apple launch it was constrained.
[00:25:23.200 --> 00:25:26.560]   And yet much less than some of the other Apple launches we've seen.
[00:25:26.560 --> 00:25:29.160]   What about, I guess the MACPro is not going to, you're not going to sell millions of the
[00:25:29.160 --> 00:25:30.160]   first day.
[00:25:30.160 --> 00:25:31.160]   I don't think they'll be lineups.
[00:25:31.160 --> 00:25:33.120]   Well, I mean, maybe they will.
[00:25:33.120 --> 00:25:34.120]   There's a certainly pent up demand.
[00:25:34.120 --> 00:25:38.120]   My MACPro is like everybody else is two, three years old.
[00:25:38.120 --> 00:25:39.120]   Absolutely.
[00:25:39.120 --> 00:25:41.240]   And they're being made in the USA.
[00:25:41.240 --> 00:25:42.240]   Let's put it this way.
[00:25:42.240 --> 00:25:44.240]   The kid uses the MACPro now.
[00:25:44.240 --> 00:25:48.240]   That's home theater, home theater PC.
[00:25:48.240 --> 00:25:52.640]   The kid is using the cheese grater.
[00:25:52.640 --> 00:25:56.520]   Even though I've upgraded it with a very fast SSD and in the most recent video card I can
[00:25:56.520 --> 00:25:57.520]   put in there.
[00:25:57.520 --> 00:26:02.920]   I edit it on my Retina MACPro because it's faster than my first gen to Helam MACPro.
[00:26:02.920 --> 00:26:06.080]   So I look forward to this.
[00:26:06.080 --> 00:26:07.080]   I don't know if I'll buy it.
[00:26:07.080 --> 00:26:09.200]   It's going to be, we know $2,500 starting.
[00:26:09.200 --> 00:26:11.960]   We know what you'd think you're going to buy it.
[00:26:11.960 --> 00:26:12.960]   I actually canceled.
[00:26:12.960 --> 00:26:15.840]   I was going to buy the new Sony mirrorless, the A7R.
[00:26:15.840 --> 00:26:19.120]   I was going to buy it about the same price, $2,300 I think.
[00:26:19.120 --> 00:26:23.640]   So I canceled that, which tells me that subconsciously I want to buy the MACPro.
[00:26:23.640 --> 00:26:27.960]   And speaking of Marco, he did an assessment of all the processors that are available.
[00:26:27.960 --> 00:26:32.800]   You can get an entry level MACPro that is not much of a performance hit but is also more
[00:26:32.800 --> 00:26:36.480]   affordable than getting close to the 10K mark.
[00:26:36.480 --> 00:26:41.640]   I am certainly going to buy the base level.
[00:26:41.640 --> 00:26:45.720]   There's no justification for paying anything more than the base level.
[00:26:45.720 --> 00:26:52.600]   So he points out that Nontec did a price list of the Xeon E5 2600 V2.
[00:26:52.600 --> 00:26:53.600]   This is an older one.
[00:26:53.600 --> 00:26:54.600]   This is from August.
[00:26:54.600 --> 00:26:56.000]   Is there a newer one from Marco?
[00:26:56.000 --> 00:27:01.680]   Let's go to Marco.org and see what he's got here.
[00:27:01.680 --> 00:27:08.640]   But yeah, just based on the parts, TurboBoost and the new MACPro CPUs, getting even an entry
[00:27:08.640 --> 00:27:09.640]   level one is--
[00:27:09.640 --> 00:27:11.120]   That's going to be fine.
[00:27:11.120 --> 00:27:12.120]   Yeah.
[00:27:12.120 --> 00:27:13.120]   Here's the table.
[00:27:13.120 --> 00:27:19.160]   With the new MACPro's independent perspective, I understand the odd looking CPU options.
[00:27:19.160 --> 00:27:27.360]   So you go from a 1620-- these are all E5s, the odds-- through the 1650, 1680 or 2697.
[00:27:27.360 --> 00:27:28.360]   And they're non-hassemble.
[00:27:28.360 --> 00:27:30.000]   And we're talking about the cost-- not when he says likely cost.
[00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:31.520]   That's the cost of the processor.
[00:27:31.520 --> 00:27:34.040]   So the top of the line processor is 2,500 bucks.
[00:27:34.040 --> 00:27:36.040]   More than the whole MACPro--
[00:27:36.040 --> 00:27:37.040]   Before you get the MACPro.
[00:27:37.040 --> 00:27:38.040]   Yeah.
[00:27:38.040 --> 00:27:41.240]   So double the amount of money or something for the high end.
[00:27:41.240 --> 00:27:46.120]   I think it pops out around 10K, I think, for the fully loaded.
[00:27:46.120 --> 00:27:50.960]   I think that this is-- it used to be that the MACPro was for-- you could even make it
[00:27:50.960 --> 00:27:56.480]   a prosumer sort of ambitious amateur or prosumer level machine.
[00:27:56.480 --> 00:28:00.120]   The more I look at this and the more I talk to people who know about this sort of architecture
[00:28:00.120 --> 00:28:04.920]   and know what this all spells out, the more convinced I am that this is one machine that
[00:28:04.920 --> 00:28:10.760]   unless you have a really specific reason why you need that sort of power, you should just
[00:28:10.760 --> 00:28:16.320]   be happy with an iMac or even be happy with a Mac Mini or be happy with a written a MacPro.
[00:28:16.320 --> 00:28:19.240]   Because it's your honor.
[00:28:19.240 --> 00:28:24.360]   There are already so many-- these devices, these consumer grade Macs are already so overpowered.
[00:28:24.360 --> 00:28:26.040]   I mean, that in a good way.
[00:28:26.040 --> 00:28:31.280]   They're there for your needs plus at least 20 to 25 to 30 percent that I can't imagine
[00:28:31.280 --> 00:28:35.680]   many people who would actually see the performance advantages of a MACPro.
[00:28:35.680 --> 00:28:39.920]   As I'm often saying, most of the CPU power is there to count to a million between cursor
[00:28:39.920 --> 00:28:42.520]   flashes while it waits for you to try to make the work.
[00:28:42.520 --> 00:28:49.040]   Yeah, I mean, the other thing to point out is that the core speeds of the low end are
[00:28:49.040 --> 00:28:52.960]   faster than the nominal core speed is faster.
[00:28:52.960 --> 00:28:54.800]   Sometimes that makes more difference than the number of cores, right?
[00:28:54.800 --> 00:28:58.120]   I made a mistake and I got a lot of really slow cores in the head of Halo MacPro and I
[00:28:58.120 --> 00:28:59.600]   wish I'd gone the other way.
[00:28:59.600 --> 00:29:00.600]   Mm-hmm.
[00:29:00.600 --> 00:29:01.600]   So--
[00:29:01.600 --> 00:29:03.080]   Very little takes advantage of all those cores.
[00:29:03.080 --> 00:29:04.080]   Right.
[00:29:04.080 --> 00:29:06.880]   So unless you know you're doing something that's going to take advantage of 12 cores--
[00:29:06.880 --> 00:29:09.520]   You don't work at Pixar or push everything to open CL.
[00:29:09.520 --> 00:29:10.520]   You're probably fine.
[00:29:10.520 --> 00:29:11.520]   Yeah.
[00:29:11.520 --> 00:29:16.440]   I mean, certainly for pages, a 3.7 gigahertz single core would probably be more than you
[00:29:16.440 --> 00:29:17.440]   need.
[00:29:17.440 --> 00:29:18.440]   Quickly, let's still beach ball, but pages will be fine.
[00:29:18.440 --> 00:29:22.400]   I mean, really, if I buy a MACPro and I suspect it's true, a lot of people, it's because
[00:29:22.400 --> 00:29:23.400]   of how it looks.
[00:29:23.400 --> 00:29:24.400]   Yes.
[00:29:24.400 --> 00:29:25.400]   Right?
[00:29:25.400 --> 00:29:26.400]   Or you want a piece of the future in your hands today.
[00:29:26.400 --> 00:29:27.560]   That's Apple's pitch with this.
[00:29:27.560 --> 00:29:30.320]   It's the hypercar, the supercar, the Lamborghini of computers.
[00:29:30.320 --> 00:29:31.320]   Yeah.
[00:29:31.320 --> 00:29:32.320]   And some people just want that today.
[00:29:32.320 --> 00:29:33.320]   They don't want to wait.
[00:29:33.320 --> 00:29:34.320]   Mm-hmm.
[00:29:34.320 --> 00:29:35.320]   Yeah.
[00:29:35.320 --> 00:29:39.480]   I think that's a very appropriate comparison too because a Lamborghini is by now.
[00:29:39.480 --> 00:29:43.080]   And no means a practical solution to any problems.
[00:29:43.080 --> 00:29:44.560]   I'm serious.
[00:29:44.560 --> 00:29:45.560]   It's expensive.
[00:29:45.560 --> 00:29:46.560]   The solutions I want one, Andy.
[00:29:46.560 --> 00:29:47.560]   That's the solution.
[00:29:47.560 --> 00:29:49.000]   It's the answer to the question.
[00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:50.000]   Can I have it now?
[00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:55.600]   It's an answer to the problem of my accountant says if I still have $1.2 million, my bank account
[00:29:55.600 --> 00:29:58.360]   has to go to either charity or the government or a new car.
[00:29:58.360 --> 00:29:59.360]   I want a new car.
[00:29:59.360 --> 00:30:02.280]   I don't have time to chop for 20 new cars.
[00:30:02.280 --> 00:30:03.640]   I want to smash into each other.
[00:30:03.640 --> 00:30:06.160]   So I'll just smash up the one car that I don't know how to drive.
[00:30:06.160 --> 00:30:10.520]   And yet, it does solve a problem that is imminent, which is 4K video workflow.
[00:30:10.520 --> 00:30:11.520]   Yes.
[00:30:11.520 --> 00:30:16.800]   And we all laughed when HD 1080p video came out and you couldn't use anything to edit
[00:30:16.800 --> 00:30:17.800]   it.
[00:30:17.800 --> 00:30:18.800]   In fact, it wasn't that long ago.
[00:30:18.800 --> 00:30:22.520]   It was the first Mac break video that Alex Lindsey shot maybe five years ago.
[00:30:22.520 --> 00:30:24.480]   And I couldn't play it back, let alone edit it.
[00:30:24.480 --> 00:30:25.480]   We tried to do one.
[00:30:25.480 --> 00:30:27.160]   We tried to do one 5-minute 4K video.
[00:30:27.160 --> 00:30:31.280]   It took us three days to render it and forever to upload it.
[00:30:31.280 --> 00:30:38.240]   And that may become more common, but certainly creating, editing and uploading 1080p videos
[00:30:38.240 --> 00:30:39.240]   now commonplace.
[00:30:39.240 --> 00:30:40.440]   We all do it.
[00:30:40.440 --> 00:30:42.000]   Our phones do it.
[00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:45.680]   So it doesn't seem that far-fetched to think that this Mac Pro, if you expect to use it
[00:30:45.680 --> 00:30:48.280]   for a few years, will be editing 4K video.
[00:30:48.280 --> 00:30:49.280]   Yeah.
[00:30:49.280 --> 00:30:50.280]   Right?
[00:30:50.280 --> 00:30:53.000]   So if you need to drive three 4K displays in a bunch of Thunderbolt displays.
[00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:59.280]   Let's talk about 4K displays because OML has now announced a 24-inch very high-res display,
[00:30:59.280 --> 00:31:00.520]   but still no word from Apple.
[00:31:00.520 --> 00:31:03.200]   And Apple says that Mac Pro is 4K ready.
[00:31:03.200 --> 00:31:05.800]   Does Apple expect us to buy Dell monitors?
[00:31:05.800 --> 00:31:10.200]   I keep hearing rumors that Apple is working on a 4K display because 4K is a good marketing
[00:31:10.200 --> 00:31:11.800]   term and it's slightly less than retinus.
[00:31:11.800 --> 00:31:17.040]   So it's probably more doable than the Pixel Double, the current 27-inch Thunderbolt display.
[00:31:17.040 --> 00:31:20.240]   But until they announce something, it's just, you know, like Andy said, this oftentimes
[00:31:20.240 --> 00:31:21.680]   Apple's probably working on everything.
[00:31:21.680 --> 00:31:22.680]   Yes.
[00:31:22.680 --> 00:31:23.680]   But it's meaningless.
[00:31:23.680 --> 00:31:26.520]   Yeah, until it becomes a product and I can buy it, it doesn't mean much.
[00:31:26.520 --> 00:31:27.880]   But Apple's got it, look, I say.
[00:31:27.880 --> 00:31:29.960]   I don't want Dell to get all the revenue.
[00:31:29.960 --> 00:31:31.520]   But Apple's also a patient company.
[00:31:31.520 --> 00:31:34.480]   They're not going to, a lot of the 4K stuff that's been rushed to the consumers at this
[00:31:34.480 --> 00:31:39.600]   point has been very low frame rate or very low refresh rate, not the best quality panels.
[00:31:39.600 --> 00:31:41.000]   It'll be interesting to see what Dell did.
[00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:43.440]   I think one of the early ones was 30 megahertz.
[00:31:43.440 --> 00:31:46.040]   Sorry, I forget the measure.
[00:31:46.040 --> 00:31:49.640]   But when Apple does it, they'll probably do one as good a quality as a Thunderbolt display
[00:31:49.640 --> 00:31:51.960]   and that's still a much harder job to do.
[00:31:51.960 --> 00:32:00.480]   Dell has a 32-inch model, the Ultra HD monitor, the UP321 4Q.
[00:32:00.480 --> 00:32:02.880]   It's $3,500.
[00:32:02.880 --> 00:32:10.680]   It is $3840 by $2160, which is not Cinema 4K, which is $490.
[00:32:10.680 --> 00:32:13.080]   So that may hurt them.
[00:32:13.080 --> 00:32:17.040]   It's not quite as wide as Cinema 4K, which means that video editors are not going to
[00:32:17.040 --> 00:32:20.480]   maybe be too happy with this.
[00:32:20.480 --> 00:32:22.320]   The 24-inch will be available December 16th.
[00:32:22.320 --> 00:32:24.520]   That's a little less expensive, only $13.99.
[00:32:24.520 --> 00:32:27.800]   Only problem Apple faces is if people buy this, either they don't want to wait for Apple,
[00:32:27.800 --> 00:32:30.720]   they don't think Apple's going to do it and they buy this, then they will not buy an Apple
[00:32:30.720 --> 00:32:31.720]   one when they come out.
[00:32:31.720 --> 00:32:32.720]   Right.
[00:32:32.720 --> 00:32:35.160]   That's, I mean, it feels like the clock is ticking for Apple.
[00:32:35.160 --> 00:32:39.440]   I would love a 32-inch display, but it's going to cost more than the computer.
[00:32:39.440 --> 00:32:40.440]   I don't think that's not...
[00:32:40.440 --> 00:32:41.440]   I'm sorry, go ahead.
[00:32:41.440 --> 00:32:42.440]   No, go ahead.
[00:32:42.440 --> 00:32:43.440]   Go ahead.
[00:32:43.440 --> 00:32:44.440]   I'm wondering.
[00:32:44.440 --> 00:32:45.440]   Do you really...
[00:32:45.440 --> 00:32:46.440]   I'm sorry.
[00:32:46.440 --> 00:32:47.440]   I thought I heard someone say, "Go ahead."
[00:32:47.440 --> 00:32:48.440]   I will set up.
[00:32:48.440 --> 00:32:49.440]   Go ahead.
[00:32:49.440 --> 00:32:50.440]   Go ahead.
[00:32:50.440 --> 00:32:51.440]   Go ahead.
[00:32:51.440 --> 00:32:52.440]   Ray.
[00:32:52.440 --> 00:32:53.440]   All right.
[00:32:53.440 --> 00:32:56.640]   Do you really think Apple's not going to have one to go the same day as the Mac Pro?
[00:32:56.640 --> 00:32:57.640]   Well, that's the question.
[00:32:57.640 --> 00:32:58.640]   It seems like they...
[00:32:58.640 --> 00:32:59.640]   No, no, no.
[00:32:59.640 --> 00:33:00.640]   I mean, it feels like...
[00:33:00.640 --> 00:33:03.240]   Yeah, it sort of feels like they would.
[00:33:03.240 --> 00:33:07.200]   And I'm basing that on nothing except for the fact that people are going to go in.
[00:33:07.200 --> 00:33:10.080]   I mean, they're going to be businesses that do it and then they're going to be high-end
[00:33:10.080 --> 00:33:15.200]   consumers or prosumers or professionals who work solo are going to go in and they're
[00:33:15.200 --> 00:33:18.160]   ready that day to spend money, right?
[00:33:18.160 --> 00:33:23.040]   So it seems like Apple would have one ready to go, assuming it's technically feasible.
[00:33:23.040 --> 00:33:27.240]   If they were confident, though, I think we would have seen it at the event pure sex appeal.
[00:33:27.240 --> 00:33:28.880]   Andy, go ahead.
[00:33:28.880 --> 00:33:33.480]   All I was going to say is that I don't think any company is better prepared to sell 4K displays
[00:33:33.480 --> 00:33:35.400]   than Apple is because they have...
[00:33:35.400 --> 00:33:39.800]   There is a store in pretty much every major mall in America that can sell a 4K display.
[00:33:39.800 --> 00:33:43.640]   They are going to get people who are interested in purchasing these things, not because of
[00:33:43.640 --> 00:33:48.680]   the same reason why a couple of years ago, some dimwits were buying 3D TVs because, hey,
[00:33:48.680 --> 00:33:49.680]   new, shiny.
[00:33:49.680 --> 00:33:51.280]   This is better than one that I have right now.
[00:33:51.280 --> 00:33:56.080]   So as a result, it's not just a case of, as you're saying, Leo, not getting a good display,
[00:33:56.080 --> 00:34:00.440]   not just a technically 4K display, but also making sure that there's not a three-month
[00:34:00.440 --> 00:34:01.440]   waitlist.
[00:34:01.440 --> 00:34:02.440]   It's good.
[00:34:02.440 --> 00:34:08.760]   In some ways, it's good PR to say that, well, look, our phones and our tablets are so popular.
[00:34:08.760 --> 00:34:10.120]   There's a two-week waiting list before...
[00:34:10.120 --> 00:34:12.000]   There's a two-week wait before they'll ship.
[00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:16.520]   If that flips over to, well, we've got your credit card number on file.
[00:34:16.520 --> 00:34:21.720]   You'll definitely be getting one as soon as we get that magical two out of every 2,000
[00:34:21.720 --> 00:34:25.720]   panels that is actually serviceable and has the color red in it somewhere.
[00:34:25.720 --> 00:34:30.960]   So I think Apple, as usual, has problems that few other tech manufacturers have.
[00:34:30.960 --> 00:34:35.520]   So I think the answer, Ken, is that, yes, Apple would love to wants to, is dying to
[00:34:35.520 --> 00:34:37.520]   and can't, right?
[00:34:37.520 --> 00:34:38.520]   Yeah.
[00:34:38.520 --> 00:34:39.720]   That's what makes me think that it's a supply issue.
[00:34:39.720 --> 00:34:41.560]   I don't think they want to actual...
[00:34:41.560 --> 00:34:43.280]   They don't have to pre-announce it.
[00:34:43.280 --> 00:34:47.160]   And I don't think they want to announce until they're sure that they have those panels on
[00:34:47.160 --> 00:34:48.160]   a ship somewhere.
[00:34:48.160 --> 00:34:54.000]   But boy, you'd kind of, again, want to kind of at least encourage people not to buy the
[00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:55.680]   Dell.
[00:34:55.680 --> 00:34:58.960]   And I figure Apple's is going to be $4.96, $4.096.
[00:34:58.960 --> 00:35:01.320]   Not, it's going to be production.
[00:35:01.320 --> 00:35:03.120]   Because who is buying a Mac Pro?
[00:35:03.120 --> 00:35:05.840]   It's a video editor working at 4K.
[00:35:05.840 --> 00:35:08.080]   That's who's going to buy the $10,000 Mac Pro.
[00:35:08.080 --> 00:35:09.080]   I mean, it's Pixar.
[00:35:09.080 --> 00:35:10.080]   It's like Alex Lindsey.
[00:35:10.080 --> 00:35:11.520]   Yeah, Alex will buy him.
[00:35:11.520 --> 00:35:12.520]   Yeah.
[00:35:12.520 --> 00:35:15.960]   So it doesn't make sense to do a consumer ultra high def.
[00:35:15.960 --> 00:35:18.400]   It makes sense to do true 4K.
[00:35:18.400 --> 00:35:23.080]   I'll tell you why all of them.
[00:35:23.080 --> 00:35:26.200]   So remember, WWDC is going to be in June.
[00:35:26.200 --> 00:35:31.560]   And Apple's going to want like a wall of 4K displays for the next application shower
[00:35:31.560 --> 00:35:32.560]   display.
[00:35:32.560 --> 00:35:33.560]   Right.
[00:35:33.560 --> 00:35:37.360]   They better say Apple on the logo.
[00:35:37.360 --> 00:35:41.280]   Exactly.
[00:35:41.280 --> 00:35:44.640]   Apple buys Topsy for two.
[00:35:44.640 --> 00:35:46.720]   I think this must be an act.
[00:35:46.720 --> 00:35:47.720]   How?
[00:35:47.720 --> 00:35:48.720]   Hire.
[00:35:48.720 --> 00:35:49.800]   I don't know how to pronounce that.
[00:35:49.800 --> 00:35:51.920]   So you hear the age.
[00:35:51.920 --> 00:35:53.800]   $200 million.
[00:35:53.800 --> 00:35:58.000]   Topsy is a social media analysis company.
[00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:00.560]   Lows customers.
[00:36:00.560 --> 00:36:04.480]   They're one of the few companies that has the fire hose from Twitter.
[00:36:04.480 --> 00:36:08.160]   That by itself is valuable, although there's no guarantee that if Apple buys them, then
[00:36:08.160 --> 00:36:09.160]   Apple would get the fire hose.
[00:36:09.160 --> 00:36:11.080]   In fact, I pretty much guarantee they wouldn't.
[00:36:11.080 --> 00:36:12.080]   So they're the partners.
[00:36:12.080 --> 00:36:13.440]   I mean, they do partner in a lot of things.
[00:36:13.440 --> 00:36:17.640]   Somebody said that Apple must have gotten, you know, Apple is a Twitter partner.
[00:36:17.640 --> 00:36:19.440]   Must have said to Twitter, "Hey, we want to buy Topsy."
[00:36:19.440 --> 00:36:21.440]   Is that okay with you?
[00:36:21.440 --> 00:36:23.120]   Although I know.
[00:36:23.120 --> 00:36:28.320]   It's hard to see the value in Topsy unless they have access to real time Twitter information.
[00:36:28.320 --> 00:36:29.320]   Which they do.
[00:36:29.320 --> 00:36:30.320]   Exactly.
[00:36:30.320 --> 00:36:32.560]   And that pipeline stays open.
[00:36:32.560 --> 00:36:33.560]   Yeah.
[00:36:33.560 --> 00:36:34.560]   I see.
[00:36:34.560 --> 00:36:38.640]   The really cool nature of this buy is that it's not normally we think about, "Okay, what
[00:36:38.640 --> 00:36:40.080]   software do they want?
[00:36:40.080 --> 00:36:41.320]   What personnel do they want?
[00:36:41.320 --> 00:36:42.720]   What patents do they want?"
[00:36:42.720 --> 00:36:46.680]   This time, the thing they're buying is inherently incredibly valuable.
[00:36:46.680 --> 00:36:51.560]   And it's just the ability to, at any given second, know what people are talking about.
[00:36:51.560 --> 00:36:53.040]   What are people interested in?
[00:36:53.040 --> 00:36:55.400]   What's getting the most conversation going?
[00:36:55.400 --> 00:36:58.200]   And that can feed into so many of their products.
[00:36:58.200 --> 00:37:04.720]   If it were just there to tell iTunes what products it needs, that should be promoting.
[00:37:04.720 --> 00:37:10.240]   It just needs to be there to just be a real time microscope on what people are thinking
[00:37:10.240 --> 00:37:11.540]   at any given moment.
[00:37:11.540 --> 00:37:13.080]   That's worth $200 million.
[00:37:13.080 --> 00:37:17.720]   Any company that has $4 billion every four weeks to spend.
[00:37:17.720 --> 00:37:18.720]   It's sentiment analytics.
[00:37:18.720 --> 00:37:21.440]   And that's incredibly valuable because you know what your customers are talking about,
[00:37:21.440 --> 00:37:23.240]   what interests them, what media.
[00:37:23.240 --> 00:37:26.480]   For a retailer like Apple, it's valuable just to know better what to sell.
[00:37:26.480 --> 00:37:30.240]   But for a company that wants to do all the other services that they provide, people who
[00:37:30.240 --> 00:37:34.160]   will plug that information into a context to wear a search engine if they happen to
[00:37:34.160 --> 00:37:36.160]   have one on Andy Lake's area.
[00:37:36.160 --> 00:37:37.720]   It's just incredibly valuable.
[00:37:37.720 --> 00:37:39.080]   So it isn't necessarily the engineers.
[00:37:39.080 --> 00:37:42.040]   It's the platform.
[00:37:42.040 --> 00:37:48.920]   This is like, there's a story from Dr. Richard Froman's biography, which he talks about being
[00:37:48.920 --> 00:37:54.040]   on the ground floor of the Manhattan Project at Los Alamos and where they've just developed
[00:37:54.040 --> 00:37:55.640]   essentially nuclear energy.
[00:37:55.640 --> 00:37:58.000]   And the government wants to patent every single idea.
[00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:03.000]   And just to be funny, he says, "Oh, here's a hundred ideas for how to use a nuclear reactor."
[00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:05.320]   He talks about, "Here's how you've hooked up to a submarine.
[00:38:05.320 --> 00:38:06.320]   You've got a nuclear saw.
[00:38:06.320 --> 00:38:07.320]   You've hooked this generator.
[00:38:07.320 --> 00:38:08.320]   You've got this nuclear generator.
[00:38:08.320 --> 00:38:10.320]   You've got this, blah, blah, blah."
[00:38:10.320 --> 00:38:13.720]   And that's where I'm thinking about right now.
[00:38:13.720 --> 00:38:18.600]   You have the product is the ability to turn a drive shaft.
[00:38:18.600 --> 00:38:21.560]   You can hook up that drive shaft to a hundred different things.
[00:38:21.560 --> 00:38:26.360]   If the drive shaft is what are people thinking about and talking about right now, you can
[00:38:26.360 --> 00:38:28.760]   hook that information up to any.
[00:38:28.760 --> 00:38:33.480]   If you're a service-based company or if you want your services to be better, that is such
[00:38:33.480 --> 00:38:35.040]   a big win for everybody.
[00:38:35.040 --> 00:38:41.360]   And in a related story, maybe this tells you something, some all, which is a sponsor and
[00:38:41.360 --> 00:38:44.600]   run by our friend Dana Atkinson just raised another $4 million.
[00:38:44.600 --> 00:38:46.360]   There's a lot of venture interested.
[00:38:46.360 --> 00:38:50.720]   They do somewhat similar thing business analytics.
[00:38:50.720 --> 00:38:53.320]   The course bringing in Twitter but other stuff as well.
[00:38:53.320 --> 00:38:55.720]   That really is a hot topic right now, I guess.
[00:38:55.720 --> 00:38:58.600]   The question is, is Apple buying this for their own use?
[00:38:58.600 --> 00:39:00.280]   Is Apple buying this to create a product?
[00:39:00.280 --> 00:39:02.640]   Is Apple buying this for the engineers?
[00:39:02.640 --> 00:39:04.440]   What is Apple going to do with talking about this?
[00:39:04.440 --> 00:39:05.880]   I think they get everything out of this.
[00:39:05.880 --> 00:39:08.760]   My old job before IMOR was working in high-end analytics.
[00:39:08.760 --> 00:39:12.640]   We just stuff like market basket analysis and sentiment analysis.
[00:39:12.640 --> 00:39:14.800]   And all of that is incredibly important.
[00:39:14.800 --> 00:39:18.360]   For example, the classic story was if you made Coke, you don't really know who's buying
[00:39:18.360 --> 00:39:19.680]   it because 7-Eleven sells it.
[00:39:19.680 --> 00:39:20.680]   You don't have that data.
[00:39:20.680 --> 00:39:23.800]   But 7-Eleven can compile that data and sell it to you and they can sell that data to Pepsi
[00:39:23.800 --> 00:39:26.760]   and they can sell it to the Lays to say what people are buying.
[00:39:26.760 --> 00:39:29.800]   And they could do things like the classic example was beer and diapers.
[00:39:29.800 --> 00:39:32.600]   If you bought beer and diapers, they could figure out who you were.
[00:39:32.600 --> 00:39:35.200]   They didn't need to know your name and then they could figure out how to give you promotions
[00:39:35.200 --> 00:39:36.320]   and sales.
[00:39:36.320 --> 00:39:40.240]   And if you run retail, this information is worth its weight in gold.
[00:39:40.240 --> 00:39:43.080]   And if you can add sentiment to that, what people actually like and talk about, then
[00:39:43.080 --> 00:39:47.520]   you can better target all your sales efforts, all your marketing efforts, all your product
[00:39:47.520 --> 00:39:48.920]   and services efforts.
[00:39:48.920 --> 00:39:51.840]   It's that prescience that Google now enjoys in the large.
[00:39:51.840 --> 00:39:54.960]   So it sounds like it's really higher for its own internal use.
[00:39:54.960 --> 00:39:57.760]   That Apple wants to apply this to its retail efforts.
[00:39:57.760 --> 00:40:01.280]   It looks like, like Annie said, you could apply this to so many things that Apple does.
[00:40:01.280 --> 00:40:03.000]   And engineers like that are incredibly smart.
[00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:05.080]   Engineers that can do that are very valuable as well.
[00:40:05.080 --> 00:40:06.080]   Absolutely.
[00:40:06.080 --> 00:40:07.600]   That's high-end stuff.
[00:40:07.600 --> 00:40:10.960]   So people have basically been thinking, "Okay, well, Apple is either going to try to figure
[00:40:10.960 --> 00:40:12.680]   out what's trending."
[00:40:12.680 --> 00:40:17.280]   Like basically see how it's going to be doing or, sorry, Apple is trying to figure out how
[00:40:17.280 --> 00:40:18.280]   it's doing.
[00:40:18.280 --> 00:40:19.280]   So it reads that off of Twitter.
[00:40:19.280 --> 00:40:20.840]   That's a sentiment thing you're talking about, I think.
[00:40:20.840 --> 00:40:24.480]   Again, how people feel about Apple support and Apple products.
[00:40:24.480 --> 00:40:26.800]   Do they like the 5C bet in the 5S?
[00:40:26.800 --> 00:40:27.800]   You could tell that from sales.
[00:40:27.800 --> 00:40:31.800]   No, there's a loan, but it's much more interesting to say, "Oh, the 5C is pretty, but I wish they
[00:40:31.800 --> 00:40:32.800]   had blue.
[00:40:32.800 --> 00:40:36.240]   There's a lot of stuff in there that is more than just what sells."
[00:40:36.240 --> 00:40:39.120]   Or every time someone buys a MacBook, they also say they bought this kind of thing.
[00:40:39.120 --> 00:40:41.320]   So these are the kind of bundles we should put together.
[00:40:41.320 --> 00:40:42.840]   More beer in MacBooks, clearly.
[00:40:42.840 --> 00:40:43.840]   Yeah.
[00:40:43.840 --> 00:40:44.840]   Go ahead.
[00:40:44.840 --> 00:40:45.840]   I'm sorry.
[00:40:45.840 --> 00:40:46.840]   It's okay.
[00:40:46.840 --> 00:40:53.520]   It seems to me, the news of the acquisition has only been out, I think, 24 hours, right?
[00:40:53.520 --> 00:40:56.040]   But most of the stories I've seen have been sort of an either/or thing.
[00:40:56.040 --> 00:40:59.360]   Like, "Okay, well, this is going to tell Apple what they can push on iTunes."
[00:40:59.360 --> 00:41:04.680]   Or this is going to tell Apple how people are responding to something, but it seems incredibly
[00:41:04.680 --> 00:41:07.960]   stupid to say it's not an either/or thing, but it's not an either/or thing.
[00:41:07.960 --> 00:41:08.960]   It's kind of--
[00:41:08.960 --> 00:41:09.960]   No, yeah, right.
[00:41:09.960 --> 00:41:10.960]   It's all of a kind of line blowing, actually.
[00:41:10.960 --> 00:41:11.960]   Yeah.
[00:41:11.960 --> 00:41:17.320]   One thing that they probably won't do is sell this as a service to other companies, right?
[00:41:17.320 --> 00:41:19.320]   They want-- if any information they know, they're keeping themselves.
[00:41:19.320 --> 00:41:22.960]   Well, I add maybe, like, if they put into I-AD and whatever's within it.
[00:41:22.960 --> 00:41:23.960]   Ah.
[00:41:23.960 --> 00:41:26.320]   Ah, that might be a good product, huh?
[00:41:26.320 --> 00:41:32.040]   But it is-- and I asked this out of-- out of sincerity is I-AD even really a thing anymore.
[00:41:32.040 --> 00:41:35.280]   Well, for I-radio, I mean, it's built into a lot-- it's built into some of the stuff that
[00:41:35.280 --> 00:41:36.280]   they're exploring.
[00:41:36.280 --> 00:41:37.280]   It's how you make it more of a thing.
[00:41:37.280 --> 00:41:38.280]   And there's this principle called--
[00:41:38.280 --> 00:41:39.280]   You make it more valuable.
[00:41:39.280 --> 00:41:40.280]   Right.
[00:41:40.280 --> 00:41:41.520]   Well, it's called least expensive offer.
[00:41:41.520 --> 00:41:44.880]   For example, if you give someone a coupon for $25, everyone in the world is going to redeem
[00:41:44.880 --> 00:41:46.360]   that coupon, but it costs you a lot of money.
[00:41:46.360 --> 00:41:47.360]   Right.
[00:41:47.360 --> 00:41:49.320]   So you want to figure out how to get the most people interested by spending the least amount
[00:41:49.320 --> 00:41:50.320]   of money.
[00:41:50.320 --> 00:41:52.000]   And that's the kind of stuff all this analytics can give you.
[00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:53.000]   Very useful stuff.
[00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:54.640]   We don't have anything nearly sophisticated.
[00:41:54.640 --> 00:41:56.640]   We just have-- Twitter.tv/survey.
[00:41:56.640 --> 00:42:01.440]   It is the most primitive means of finding out what our audience thinks.
[00:42:01.440 --> 00:42:03.480]   I can imagine.
[00:42:03.480 --> 00:42:04.760]   But that's what we got.
[00:42:04.760 --> 00:42:08.800]   No, I have-- I have him in my other room the most primitive means of finding out what
[00:42:08.800 --> 00:42:09.800]   an audience is thinking.
[00:42:09.800 --> 00:42:12.240]   That is a TV Nielsen's log book.
[00:42:12.240 --> 00:42:13.240]   Oh my god.
[00:42:13.240 --> 00:42:18.880]   Which looks like a medical SAT test book from 1969.
[00:42:18.880 --> 00:42:22.920]   Now, were you said this by Nielsen or somebody gave this to you?
[00:42:22.920 --> 00:42:27.400]   No, no, they sent me a diary for last week.
[00:42:27.400 --> 00:42:30.560]   You're not supposed to talk about that.
[00:42:30.560 --> 00:42:33.680]   I've been-- people have said that to me before.
[00:42:33.680 --> 00:42:36.560]   I carefully read the cover letter and what was inside the book.
[00:42:36.560 --> 00:42:39.400]   Nothing said that you're not allowed to tell people that you have this thing.
[00:42:39.400 --> 00:42:45.120]   You know, Nielsen and radio, both-- and Arbitron and radio have both moved to automated people
[00:42:45.120 --> 00:42:46.120]   meter systems.
[00:42:46.120 --> 00:42:48.520]   But the diary systems persist.
[00:42:48.520 --> 00:42:50.920]   And I mean, there's all sorts of problems with the diary systems.
[00:42:50.920 --> 00:42:53.200]   Radio was diary only for a long time.
[00:42:53.200 --> 00:42:56.120]   This was-- I mean, I knew in general what a lot of the problems were.
[00:42:56.120 --> 00:43:00.120]   But looking at this book and I'm thinking to myself, who is going to-- this is not even
[00:43:00.120 --> 00:43:02.080]   an easy to fill out set of forms.
[00:43:02.080 --> 00:43:06.440]   So you have-- so you not only have people-- you're only sampling a certain amount of
[00:43:06.440 --> 00:43:11.480]   people who agree-- who wanted to take part in this, but also people who felt really,
[00:43:11.480 --> 00:43:17.280]   really strongly about it or are very OCD-type people to sit down and log everything.
[00:43:17.280 --> 00:43:20.920]   I mean, I had-- it took me all of-- after-- after reading through this and trying to
[00:43:20.920 --> 00:43:23.960]   understand the instructions, it took me all of what?
[00:43:23.960 --> 00:43:27.120]   10 minutes to create a Google form so that--
[00:43:27.120 --> 00:43:28.120]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:43:28.120 --> 00:43:29.120]   --anytime-- I'm serious.
[00:43:29.120 --> 00:43:32.600]   And it was much, much better than their log book because I actually got me curious as
[00:43:32.600 --> 00:43:35.840]   to, well, that's-- for my own interest, I'm interested in seeing--
[00:43:35.840 --> 00:43:38.160]   when am I watching videos on YouTube?
[00:43:38.160 --> 00:43:40.440]   When am I watching actual television?
[00:43:40.440 --> 00:43:41.440]   Does it ask you about that?
[00:43:41.440 --> 00:43:44.240]   Does it ask you about non-broadcast viewing?
[00:43:44.240 --> 00:43:45.640]   I'd have to check again.
[00:43:45.640 --> 00:43:48.640]   There is some differentiation, but it's not very fine-grained.
[00:43:48.640 --> 00:43:50.840]   I'm curious as to-- I watched this.
[00:43:50.840 --> 00:43:51.840]   Well, what was it?
[00:43:51.840 --> 00:43:52.840]   It was on YouTube.
[00:43:52.840 --> 00:43:54.720]   OK, did you watch it on a TV screen?
[00:43:54.720 --> 00:43:56.040]   Did you watch it on a laptop screen?
[00:43:56.040 --> 00:43:57.040]   You watched it on a phone.
[00:43:57.040 --> 00:43:58.040]   How would you--
[00:43:58.040 --> 00:43:59.040]   How long would you--
[00:43:59.040 --> 00:44:01.840]   Yeah, and that-- and that-- and that took-- again, it took me all of, like, 15 minutes,
[00:44:01.840 --> 00:44:02.840]   10 minutes to do.
[00:44:02.840 --> 00:44:06.720]   And I saw some holes and it took me maybe two minutes to update it to change it.
[00:44:06.720 --> 00:44:11.200]   And I have a spreadsheet that I could then-- I can then now-- when I sit down and I really
[00:44:11.200 --> 00:44:15.760]   get a couple of shots in me and I can now transfer all of this information into this
[00:44:15.760 --> 00:44:20.920]   log book, it's like you have to be-- you have to be really, really, really motivated to see
[00:44:20.920 --> 00:44:24.120]   the amazing race and Bob's burger get a jump for that week.
[00:44:24.120 --> 00:44:25.120]   But--
[00:44:25.120 --> 00:44:26.120]   Well, but--
[00:44:26.120 --> 00:44:27.120]   And that's a very important point.
[00:44:27.120 --> 00:44:31.000]   And it was actually one of the insights that led me to creating Twit.
[00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:36.080]   The things that succeed in these kinds of methodologies are things that engage people
[00:44:36.080 --> 00:44:38.240]   so much that they're willing to take the time.
[00:44:38.240 --> 00:44:41.640]   And you just mentioned two shows you love, Bob's burger and amazing race.
[00:44:41.640 --> 00:44:48.000]   And so you're much more likely to write that down than the larger typical audience.
[00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:52.520]   But the larger typical audience is very likely under-measured because they don't-- they're
[00:44:52.520 --> 00:44:55.640]   not obsessive about a show enough to actually take the time.
[00:44:55.640 --> 00:44:59.840]   It's one of the reasons people always figured that Rush Limbaugh always got better radio ratings
[00:44:59.840 --> 00:45:04.680]   than anybody in his market because the fans of Rush Limbaugh were much more likely to
[00:45:04.680 --> 00:45:07.160]   take the time to say, yes, I listened at 9/3/10.
[00:45:07.160 --> 00:45:08.160]   Monday through Friday.
[00:45:08.160 --> 00:45:10.200]   I'm a proud listener as opposed to--
[00:45:10.200 --> 00:45:11.200]   I'm a proud listener.
[00:45:11.200 --> 00:45:15.360]   As opposed to your nightly newscast where you turn it on-- you're actively watching it,
[00:45:15.360 --> 00:45:18.440]   but it's not as though I'm a proud watcher of WBZ Channel 4--
[00:45:18.440 --> 00:45:19.440]   You're not.
[00:45:19.440 --> 00:45:20.440]   I mean, you're not right in it.
[00:45:20.440 --> 00:45:21.440]   Yeah.
[00:45:21.440 --> 00:45:26.960]   So that's one of the reasons-- that insight was what led me to say, we need to create products,
[00:45:26.960 --> 00:45:32.080]   whether on broadcast or internet, that engage people so much that they are enthusiastic
[00:45:32.080 --> 00:45:37.560]   and they go to twit.tv/survey and fill the format because those are the people who are
[00:45:37.560 --> 00:45:41.560]   most valuable, like 10 times more valuable, frankly.
[00:45:41.560 --> 00:45:45.000]   And it's-- now, of course, that's why they moved to People Meter and it was very controversial
[00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:47.120]   in radio when they introduced this a couple of years ago.
[00:45:47.120 --> 00:45:52.840]   And this is, by the way, why they still do diaries is because when you find out what
[00:45:52.840 --> 00:45:56.920]   people actually do, it's at such great odds from what they write in the diaries.
[00:45:56.920 --> 00:45:57.920]   Yes.
[00:45:57.920 --> 00:45:58.920]   Yeah.
[00:45:58.920 --> 00:46:00.400]   And what it does is it raises the issue.
[00:46:00.400 --> 00:46:05.000]   God, do you mean these numbers we've been buying as advertisers all this time are crap?
[00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:06.440]   I didn't think of that before.
[00:46:06.440 --> 00:46:10.280]   I think we all have been in business long enough to know that we have had those relationships
[00:46:10.280 --> 00:46:15.440]   with people where, OK, I know what the fact is, now it's time to ask this person what
[00:46:15.440 --> 00:46:18.680]   the fact is just to find out what they will tell me.
[00:46:18.680 --> 00:46:19.680]   Right.
[00:46:19.680 --> 00:46:20.920]   That makes more sense now.
[00:46:20.920 --> 00:46:21.920]   Yeah.
[00:46:21.920 --> 00:46:22.920]   That was the old joke.
[00:46:22.920 --> 00:46:24.520]   Everyone writes down PBS, but everyone really watches TMZ.
[00:46:24.520 --> 00:46:25.520]   Exactly right.
[00:46:25.520 --> 00:46:26.520]   That's exactly right.
[00:46:26.520 --> 00:46:27.520]   Nobody wants to admit it.
[00:46:27.520 --> 00:46:29.840]   I love TMZ is on PBS.
[00:46:29.840 --> 00:46:34.800]   I have modeled a number of our shows around TMZ or trying to.
[00:46:34.800 --> 00:46:38.720]   I want to be the guy who sits on the partition and talks to his staff and says, what do you
[00:46:38.720 --> 00:46:39.720]   think about that?
[00:46:39.720 --> 00:46:41.760]   Hey, and then I have to hold the coffee.
[00:46:41.760 --> 00:46:44.120]   I love that the format of that energy.
[00:46:44.120 --> 00:46:47.880]   The content is crap, but the form actually is not as fascinating, but the format of is
[00:46:47.880 --> 00:46:48.880]   so well done.
[00:46:48.880 --> 00:46:52.480]   It's what it's how I want to design all our shows from now on.
[00:46:52.480 --> 00:46:55.240]   And on that note.
[00:46:55.240 --> 00:47:02.120]   I want to ask about, and maybe I read about it on I'm more, the idea that app, well, I
[00:47:02.120 --> 00:47:06.840]   certainly know that you've been saying Apple's moving into fashion, but the idea that maybe
[00:47:06.840 --> 00:47:10.840]   wearables is more than a watch, more than glasses, but something actually wearable.
[00:47:10.840 --> 00:47:11.840]   Let's talk about it.
[00:47:11.840 --> 00:47:13.920]   There's a little buzz going on in just a second.
[00:47:13.920 --> 00:47:16.720]   Renee Richie is here from imore.com and crackberry.com.
[00:47:16.720 --> 00:47:18.240]   It's nice to have you in studio.
[00:47:18.240 --> 00:47:19.240]   Thank you.
[00:47:19.240 --> 00:47:20.240]   Let's be here.
[00:47:20.240 --> 00:47:22.320]   OS, Mac OS, Ken, Ken Ray is here.
[00:47:22.320 --> 00:47:24.960]   On the Mac OS, Ken daily news podcasts.
[00:47:24.960 --> 00:47:29.440]   Great to have you Mac OS, Ken.com and his new enterprise.
[00:47:29.440 --> 00:47:30.440]   I.
[00:47:30.440 --> 00:47:32.000]   Cat charts.
[00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:33.000]   I what?
[00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:34.000]   Chart.
[00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:35.000]   I chart.
[00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:36.000]   Yeah, think about, you know, like a.
[00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:37.000]   I chart.
[00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:38.000]   Yeah.
[00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:39.000]   I chart.
[00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:40.000]   E Y E chart.
[00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:41.000]   Right.
[00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:45.360]   Which is in the newsstand on on your iPhone, which is an awesome place to be loved the newsstand
[00:47:45.360 --> 00:47:48.240]   couldn't be a better place from the Chicago.
[00:47:48.240 --> 00:47:53.760]   Sometimes it's actually on a newsstand, a physical newsstand, Andy and I go.
[00:47:53.760 --> 00:47:55.080]   Oh, what's that?
[00:47:55.080 --> 00:47:58.520]   I was just downloading new content through the newsstand app, which I get most of my
[00:47:58.520 --> 00:48:00.560]   news and entertainment these days.
[00:48:00.560 --> 00:48:03.000]   Is the sun times on newsstand?
[00:48:03.000 --> 00:48:04.000]   No, it isn't.
[00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:07.640]   But we do have a web site.
[00:48:07.640 --> 00:48:08.640]   Yes.
[00:48:08.640 --> 00:48:10.680]   That I encourage people to come and visit.
[00:48:10.680 --> 00:48:11.920]   Go visit the website.
[00:48:11.920 --> 00:48:12.920]   That's where you'll find Mr.
[00:48:12.920 --> 00:48:13.920]   Eye.
[00:48:13.920 --> 00:48:18.200]   Our show today's brought to you by another web site where I find almost all of my
[00:48:18.200 --> 00:48:19.200]   reading.
[00:48:19.200 --> 00:48:23.640]   In fact, I was talking to my daughter yesterday about lending her books and I realized, oh,
[00:48:23.640 --> 00:48:26.760]   wait a minute, everything is unaudible.
[00:48:26.760 --> 00:48:32.920]   I have not bought a physical book in a long, long time because I love listening to audible.com.
[00:48:32.920 --> 00:48:37.440]   Audible, it has 150,000 books.
[00:48:37.440 --> 00:48:41.480]   All the best sellers appear on audible.com.
[00:48:41.480 --> 00:48:45.400]   And I just bought, you know, I just took advantage of my audible subscription.
[00:48:45.400 --> 00:48:49.160]   I got a couple of new books that I've been meaning to read for some time.
[00:48:49.160 --> 00:48:50.160]   I can show you my library.
[00:48:50.160 --> 00:48:52.000]   I've been an audible member since 2000.
[00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:57.000]   Over 500 books here, but I just got Bradstones, the everything store.
[00:48:57.000 --> 00:49:02.640]   After seeing Jeff Bezos' quadcopter delivery system on 60 minutes, I thought I'm going
[00:49:02.640 --> 00:49:05.840]   to read some more about this and Nick Bilton's hatching Twitter.
[00:49:05.840 --> 00:49:09.880]   Of course, Nick's a good friend of the show, a regular on the show on Twitter.
[00:49:09.880 --> 00:49:13.120]   And boy, I read the excerpt and I can't wait to read the full story.
[00:49:13.120 --> 00:49:18.560]   As you can see, I'm just finishing now a difficult man behind the scenes of a creative revolution
[00:49:18.560 --> 00:49:20.840]   from the Sopranos and the Wired and Mad Men in Breaking Bad.
[00:49:20.840 --> 00:49:23.040]   And I have to say Brett Martin has written a wonderful book.
[00:49:23.040 --> 00:49:24.280]   Now, here's the deal.
[00:49:24.280 --> 00:49:26.480]   One of these can be yours for free.
[00:49:26.480 --> 00:49:29.400]   Turkish phase one, unit one through five from Pimsler.
[00:49:29.400 --> 00:49:32.400]   Yes, they have language courses.
[00:49:32.400 --> 00:49:36.440]   And I have to admit my Turkish lessons have not been going great, but I'm working on
[00:49:36.440 --> 00:49:38.600]   it.
[00:49:38.600 --> 00:49:39.880]   Just so much great stuff on here.
[00:49:39.880 --> 00:49:46.080]   And I want you to try it right now by go to audible.com and browse around, find a book.

[00:49:51.560 --> 00:49:52.840]   That is awesome.
[00:49:52.840 --> 00:49:55.320]   So that's going to be a movie with Ben Stiller, right?
[00:49:55.320 --> 00:49:58.320]   So this is an interesting tie in.
[00:49:58.320 --> 00:50:05.720]   The classic James Thurber novel, he reads and it's free.
[00:50:05.720 --> 00:50:06.960]   Movie deal.
[00:50:06.960 --> 00:50:07.960]   Movie deal.
[00:50:07.960 --> 00:50:10.880]   It's only 15 minutes, I guess it should be free.
[00:50:10.880 --> 00:50:11.880]   It's a short story.
[00:50:11.880 --> 00:50:12.880]   It's not a novel.
[00:50:12.880 --> 00:50:13.880]   I'll take it back.
[00:50:13.880 --> 00:50:15.880]   But I'd love to listen to that.
[00:50:15.880 --> 00:50:17.960]   That's really cool.
[00:50:17.960 --> 00:50:20.400]   So Audible has a lot of freebies like that too.

[00:50:25.160 --> 00:50:28.400]   They're really a wonderful company to be involved in.
[00:50:28.400 --> 00:50:29.400]   Take it from me.
[00:50:29.400 --> 00:50:32.320]   They've been an advertiser and I've shown for more than five years now.

[00:50:49.080 --> 00:50:51.560]   that has never been recorded before.
[00:50:51.560 --> 00:50:52.560]   Audio books of it.
[00:50:52.560 --> 00:50:56.760]   Paolo's Batcha Glupi's The Wind Up Girl which is a one, I really enjoyed it.
[00:50:56.760 --> 00:51:03.800]   It really is an evocative, it's perfect for audio because one of the things that happens
[00:51:03.800 --> 00:51:07.720]   with me and maybe it happens when you read a physical book but with me when I hear a book
[00:51:07.720 --> 00:51:09.080]   I see it.
[00:51:09.080 --> 00:51:13.960]   And this is a futuristic kind of dystopian future that is so detailed and vivid.
[00:51:13.960 --> 00:51:18.960]   No movie could do it just as I think but boy when you do it in your mind it is stunning.
[00:51:18.960 --> 00:51:19.960]   It is spectacular.
[00:51:19.960 --> 00:51:22.600]   Anyway, go on and on.

[00:51:48.360 --> 00:51:55.360]   When you just don't have time to hold a book or read a book.
[00:51:55.360 --> 00:51:56.360]   Audible.com/macbreak we thank them for their support.
[00:51:56.360 --> 00:51:59.440]   I didn't ask you Andy what you're listening to.
[00:51:59.440 --> 00:52:01.320]   Very quickly I'm a big audio book.
[00:52:01.320 --> 00:52:05.480]   I'm a much bigger fan of nonfiction and biography than anything else.
[00:52:05.480 --> 00:52:09.280]   Henry Bushkin who was Johnny Carson's lawyer for a couple of decades.
[00:52:09.280 --> 00:52:11.280]   I don't know.
[00:52:11.280 --> 00:52:12.960]   I don't want to be ghost.
[00:52:12.960 --> 00:52:18.000]   It's almost like if there's a beloved figure there's like someone says the hourglass going
[00:52:18.000 --> 00:52:21.680]   as to it would be tacky if I wrote a tell all book today.
[00:52:21.680 --> 00:52:26.360]   But certainly by 2013 I can come out with a book and it won't be it won't be how it
[00:52:26.360 --> 00:52:27.520]   will be exactly.
[00:52:27.520 --> 00:52:32.920]   And so it's it's not the like complete biography of a very complicated guy that that we're
[00:52:32.920 --> 00:52:33.920]   all hoping for.
[00:52:33.920 --> 00:52:36.400]   I'm excuse me Carson fans would be hoping for.
[00:52:36.400 --> 00:52:40.120]   But it is one person's point of view.
[00:52:40.120 --> 00:52:46.840]   It's really he starts off when he needs when it's the book kind of starts off when Carson
[00:52:46.840 --> 00:52:52.600]   needs a lawyer to help him break into his wife's secret apartment so he can prove that
[00:52:52.600 --> 00:52:54.680]   this woman has been cheating on him.
[00:52:54.680 --> 00:52:58.960]   And then it goes all the way through his retirement and oh I guess it's Bushkin I got
[00:52:58.960 --> 00:52:59.960]   a list exactly.
[00:52:59.960 --> 00:53:00.960]   Yeah.
[00:53:00.960 --> 00:53:04.080]   So again not the complete biography but an interesting point of view and if you want dirt.
[00:53:04.080 --> 00:53:05.080]   Okay.
[00:53:05.080 --> 00:53:06.080]   There's dirt here.
[00:53:06.080 --> 00:53:08.720]   I listened to Ed McMahon's biography of Johnny.
[00:53:08.720 --> 00:53:11.240]   I'll listen to him all because I was a I'm a huge Johnnie.
[00:53:11.240 --> 00:53:12.240]   Did he narrate that one?
[00:53:12.240 --> 00:53:13.240]   Yeah.
[00:53:13.240 --> 00:53:17.760]   Is that distracting to hear?
[00:53:17.760 --> 00:53:20.840]   Mostly it's about heavy drinking quite a bit of it.
[00:53:20.840 --> 00:53:25.760]   Jimmy the geek in our chat rooms listening to Johnny I've Leeander Connie's new book.
[00:53:25.760 --> 00:53:27.160]   Am I saying his name wrong?
[00:53:27.160 --> 00:53:28.160]   Somebody tweeted at me.
[00:53:28.160 --> 00:53:31.320]   You've been saying his name around the whole show Leeander never corrected me.
[00:53:31.320 --> 00:53:37.200]   I have well I have I have an old friend who J O and Y who pronounced it Joni.
[00:53:37.200 --> 00:53:38.920]   And so I tend to just reflect.
[00:53:38.920 --> 00:53:41.320]   We say Joni I've been told this Johnny Johnny.
[00:53:41.320 --> 00:53:42.320]   Yeah.
[00:53:42.320 --> 00:53:43.320]   It's just reflux.
[00:53:43.320 --> 00:53:44.320]   I try about Leeander.
[00:53:44.320 --> 00:53:45.320]   Leeander Connie.
[00:53:45.320 --> 00:53:46.880]   I don't know if it's Katie or Connie.
[00:53:46.880 --> 00:53:47.880]   Is it Katie?
[00:53:47.880 --> 00:53:48.880]   I only ever called him.
[00:53:48.880 --> 00:53:49.880]   Just call him Leeander probably.
[00:53:49.880 --> 00:53:54.280]   I got some other ones here from our from our chat room.
[00:53:54.280 --> 00:53:56.640]   M and seven is reading ball four by Jim Bowden.
[00:53:56.640 --> 00:53:58.640]   Oh that is a juicy book.
[00:53:58.640 --> 00:53:59.640]   There you go.
[00:53:59.640 --> 00:54:03.680]   And the M and seven says it's funny because Bowden's laughing as he reads it.
[00:54:03.680 --> 00:54:05.720]   He's remembering those moments.
[00:54:05.720 --> 00:54:07.720]   Right.
[00:54:07.720 --> 00:54:08.720]   That's awesome.
[00:54:08.720 --> 00:54:12.480]   Our bononey bononey Monini says the full cast audio play Avengers game.
[00:54:12.480 --> 00:54:14.320]   Enders game alive is fantastic.
[00:54:14.320 --> 00:54:15.320]   I agree.
[00:54:15.320 --> 00:54:16.320]   I loved that.
[00:54:16.320 --> 00:54:20.400]   I was my refresher before I went to see the movie and that was really it made me want
[00:54:20.400 --> 00:54:23.000]   to hear more radio plays.
[00:54:23.000 --> 00:54:27.080]   Just I just the first dune book is done almost like an a lot of it is a place for a good
[00:54:27.080 --> 00:54:33.600]   to I just watched I just watched David Lynch's dune.
[00:54:33.600 --> 00:54:35.680]   On the one hand it's great because I love the books.
[00:54:35.680 --> 00:54:37.480]   I love the books.
[00:54:37.480 --> 00:54:41.200]   On the other hand it's so campy but you remember it a lot of it a lot of the ladies.
[00:54:41.200 --> 00:54:42.200]   I remember it.
[00:54:42.200 --> 00:54:43.200]   Yes.
[00:54:43.200 --> 00:54:44.200]   Yeah.
[00:54:44.200 --> 00:54:46.040]   Your name is a killing word Leo.
[00:54:46.040 --> 00:54:47.440]   What deep.
[00:54:47.440 --> 00:54:50.120]   The movie I ever walked out on.
[00:54:50.120 --> 00:54:51.120]   Yeah.
[00:54:51.120 --> 00:54:53.760]   Well you were fan of the do novels I'm sure.
[00:54:53.760 --> 00:54:54.760]   No no.
[00:54:54.760 --> 00:54:58.600]   I never actually see rather do novels but a huge huge Star Wars fan this has to be a
[00:54:58.600 --> 00:54:59.600]   science fiction.
[00:54:59.600 --> 00:55:02.600]   I think it has to be really good and I walked right out of it.
[00:55:02.600 --> 00:55:07.240]   It was like the third time there was like the soundtrack was that's but oh the soundtrack
[00:55:07.240 --> 00:55:08.760]   is so over the top.
[00:55:08.760 --> 00:55:09.760]   Spice.
[00:55:09.760 --> 00:55:10.760]   Life.
[00:55:10.760 --> 00:55:11.760]   Spice.
[00:55:11.760 --> 00:55:12.760]   Life is.
[00:55:12.760 --> 00:55:13.760]   I will not sit here.
[00:55:13.760 --> 00:55:14.760]   Spice.
[00:55:14.760 --> 00:55:16.200]   And here you put down the movie.
[00:55:16.200 --> 00:55:18.960]   See it's really an interesting thing and there's some polarizing.
[00:55:18.960 --> 00:55:21.880]   Wait Rene really you like that movie.
[00:55:21.880 --> 00:55:25.760]   So we full disclosure we just did a long podcast about it with Guy English.
[00:55:25.760 --> 00:55:26.760]   Did you really?
[00:55:26.760 --> 00:55:28.080]   Don Melton from Apple Guy English.
[00:55:28.080 --> 00:55:29.080]   What a cool episode.
[00:55:29.080 --> 00:55:33.560]   Talking about dune because we all love that we're doing 80s movies with Melton it's a
[00:55:33.560 --> 00:55:35.760]   sub genre.
[00:55:35.760 --> 00:55:40.680]   And we all enjoy it quite though the book the movie not the miniseries so much.
[00:55:40.680 --> 00:55:41.680]   I didn't see the miniseries.
[00:55:41.680 --> 00:55:43.560]   The audible book is fantastic though.
[00:55:43.560 --> 00:55:45.800]   So that and that's acted out.
[00:55:45.800 --> 00:55:49.440]   It's both so they the original abridged version was acted out then they made a non abridged
[00:55:49.440 --> 00:55:50.440]   version.
[00:55:50.440 --> 00:55:52.400]   Yeah there's 21 hour 21 hour version.
[00:55:52.400 --> 00:55:56.800]   Oh so it's made up of the acted out one plus whatever the narrative.
[00:55:56.800 --> 00:56:01.160]   Oh so that would be the one to get because then it isn't it's in my library.
[00:56:01.160 --> 00:56:03.120]   Apparently I've listened to it and I forgot about it.
[00:56:03.120 --> 00:56:05.480]   It is one of my all time favorite books.
[00:56:05.480 --> 00:56:06.480]   The book is phenomenal.
[00:56:06.480 --> 00:56:10.000]   You would like the book far more than oh yeah the movie doesn't do it.
[00:56:10.000 --> 00:56:14.800]   And yet I think if you've seen the book I mean read the book seeing the movie then is
[00:56:14.800 --> 00:56:17.880]   kind of nice because you go oh yeah the movie is very David.
[00:56:17.880 --> 00:56:18.880]   The book is not.
[00:56:18.880 --> 00:56:25.040]   Yeah no the one blessing that dune gave us is David Lynch didn't direct that Jedi.
[00:56:25.040 --> 00:56:27.720]   That's really it.
[00:56:27.720 --> 00:56:30.800]   Yeah I don't think he'll be invited to direct any of the Disney.
[00:56:30.800 --> 00:56:35.440]   I don't know imagine the Ewoks again but I'll imagine them like walking backwards with
[00:56:35.440 --> 00:56:39.520]   the film flips so they're walking forwards and delivering their lines that way.
[00:56:39.520 --> 00:56:40.520]   That's not bad.
[00:56:40.520 --> 00:56:42.080]   Really nicely creepy Ewoks.
[00:56:42.080 --> 00:56:46.880]   Those are Ewoks that could have taken down the garrisons of the Empire's best men.
[00:56:46.880 --> 00:56:51.440]   Just a lot of like close ups of just Darth Vader just staring at things.
[00:56:51.440 --> 00:56:55.280]   Many series is much more faithful to the book but they took out all the really cool lines
[00:56:55.280 --> 00:56:56.880]   which is really terrible.
[00:56:56.880 --> 00:56:59.480]   Yeah the lines from the book of the lines.
[00:56:59.480 --> 00:57:00.480]   The book.
[00:57:00.480 --> 00:57:01.480]   The book.
[00:57:01.480 --> 00:57:03.880]   There's some fantastic dialogue in the book and it was just missing.
[00:57:03.880 --> 00:57:07.560]   I mean I'll have to listen to your show.
[00:57:07.560 --> 00:57:09.080]   Maybe I'll have it on the show.
[00:57:09.080 --> 00:57:10.400]   I'm now in a dune kick.
[00:57:10.400 --> 00:57:11.400]   It's been long enough.
[00:57:11.400 --> 00:57:12.400]   I haven't read it.
[00:57:12.400 --> 00:57:13.400]   Apparently I haven't in my.
[00:57:13.400 --> 00:57:14.400]   When did I listen to?
[00:57:14.400 --> 00:57:17.160]   There's nothing about dune is I think everybody's a bad guy.
[00:57:17.160 --> 00:57:19.160]   There's no real hero in dune.
[00:57:19.160 --> 00:57:20.160]   Everybody's a villain.
[00:57:20.160 --> 00:57:21.160]   Oh come on.
[00:57:21.160 --> 00:57:22.440]   Paul at tradies is a hero.
[00:57:22.440 --> 00:57:26.160]   I don't know spoilers Leo but Paul is not a hero like character at the end.
[00:57:26.160 --> 00:57:27.560]   He's about to start a jihad.
[00:57:27.560 --> 00:57:28.960]   Oh man.
[00:57:28.960 --> 00:57:30.960]   There's no good people in that movie.
[00:57:30.960 --> 00:57:31.960]   That's true.
[00:57:31.960 --> 00:57:37.440]   It's not a single good guy is there?
[00:57:37.440 --> 00:57:38.440]   No.
[00:57:38.440 --> 00:57:39.440]   That's sad.
[00:57:39.440 --> 00:57:42.080]   What about the princess airline?
[00:57:42.080 --> 00:57:43.280]   Yeah princess airline.
[00:57:43.280 --> 00:57:44.280]   She's cool.
[00:57:44.280 --> 00:57:47.160]   She's barely an Anakin Skywalker rendered character.
[00:57:47.160 --> 00:57:48.160]   Yeah.
[00:57:48.160 --> 00:57:50.960]   No she's the narrator but that's it.
[00:57:50.960 --> 00:57:53.200]   How about his mother?
[00:57:53.200 --> 00:57:54.200]   His mother's nice.
[00:57:54.200 --> 00:57:57.200]   Yeah but I don't want to spoil that friend because you might read it.
[00:57:57.200 --> 00:57:59.280]   Alright alright alright alright.
[00:57:59.280 --> 00:58:00.280]   Free Mavericks.
[00:58:00.280 --> 00:58:01.280]   Go ahead.
[00:58:01.280 --> 00:58:03.680]   Well I just I just hate to lose.
[00:58:03.680 --> 00:58:04.680]   This is an interesting conversation.
[00:58:04.680 --> 00:58:06.480]   I'm really kind of keyed into it.
[00:58:06.480 --> 00:58:09.440]   That's probably more interesting than like whatever we're about to talk about.
[00:58:09.440 --> 00:58:11.480]   I guarantee you it is.
[00:58:11.480 --> 00:58:15.760]   No lightning connector is somewhat defective in South America.
[00:58:15.760 --> 00:58:16.920]   Isn't that sad?
[00:58:16.920 --> 00:58:19.080]   I only want to be free.
[00:58:19.080 --> 00:58:24.720]   Free Mavericks that's always 10 adoption record.
[00:58:24.720 --> 00:58:26.200]   Free is a good price.
[00:58:26.200 --> 00:58:27.920]   For some people free is a great price.
[00:58:27.920 --> 00:58:28.920]   I'm not sure.
[00:58:28.920 --> 00:58:34.040]   Ironically Mavericks is one of the first OS 10s I would say you shouldn't rush to upgrade
[00:58:34.040 --> 00:58:35.040]   to.
[00:58:35.040 --> 00:58:37.480]   It introduces some problems that can be deal breakers.
[00:58:37.480 --> 00:58:41.400]   Well if you had a problem that was like Mountain Line if you needed multi monitor support it
[00:58:41.400 --> 00:58:42.840]   was not a line or multi line.
[00:58:42.840 --> 00:58:45.280]   Yeah there was several things or battery life.
[00:58:45.280 --> 00:58:48.880]   My MacBook Pro, Retina MacBook Pro got two hours extra battery life after Mavericks.
[00:58:48.880 --> 00:58:51.040]   So great in that regard.
[00:58:51.040 --> 00:58:53.480]   But then there's the Coraudio issue with YouTube.
[00:58:53.480 --> 00:58:54.880]   There's all sorts of weird issues.
[00:58:54.880 --> 00:58:58.960]   If you want, you know I read somebody said hey I don't want finder tabs.
[00:58:58.960 --> 00:59:01.480]   I want new finder windows and that's gone.
[00:59:01.480 --> 00:59:03.200]   And little things like that.
[00:59:03.200 --> 00:59:08.160]   Everybody's got one thing that you know you might say oh man.
[00:59:08.160 --> 00:59:10.680]   Would you say the bugs are out now though?
[00:59:10.680 --> 00:59:14.240]   We finally got the update to the update.
[00:59:14.240 --> 00:59:16.720]   Is it time to get Mavericks if you haven't?
[00:59:16.720 --> 00:59:22.040]   It's a long time OS 10 user you know you just trade one bug for another.
[00:59:22.040 --> 00:59:26.280]   The old Coraudio issues have led to different Coraudio issues.
[00:59:26.280 --> 00:59:27.760]   Oh man.
[00:59:27.760 --> 00:59:33.000]   And in the end the bugs you take are equal to the bugs you make.
[00:59:33.000 --> 00:59:34.800]   Forgive me I'm not in the chat room.
[00:59:34.800 --> 00:59:36.560]   Can I put a question out to the chat room?
[00:59:36.560 --> 00:59:39.440]   Yes and I'll read back their answers to you.
[00:59:39.440 --> 00:59:42.720]   Does Adobe Audition 5.5 work in Mavericks?
[00:59:42.720 --> 00:59:46.080]   I've been going to Roaring Apps since the day Mavericks came out and they don't have
[00:59:46.080 --> 00:59:47.080]   an answer there.
[00:59:47.080 --> 00:59:50.280]   My guess is not because of the changes in Coraudio.
[00:59:50.280 --> 00:59:52.280]   Audition hasn't been updated by Adobe in a while.
[00:59:52.280 --> 00:59:54.480]   That's what you use for editing your podcast.
[00:59:54.480 --> 00:59:55.480]   Yes.
[00:59:55.480 --> 00:59:57.080]   I think it's time to shift over.
[00:59:57.080 --> 01:00:04.400]   You know auditions when I use and I love it is the program and I try to use logic and
[01:00:04.400 --> 01:00:05.560]   whatever else apples.
[01:00:05.560 --> 01:00:07.640]   I guess they don't make anything else.
[01:00:07.640 --> 01:00:08.640]   They used to have an editor.
[01:00:08.640 --> 01:00:09.640]   Garageband and--
[01:00:09.640 --> 01:00:10.640]   Garageband.
[01:00:10.640 --> 01:00:13.240]   You can't do anything too long in.
[01:00:13.240 --> 01:00:14.240]   Yeah.
[01:00:14.240 --> 01:00:15.240]   I don't know.
[01:00:15.240 --> 01:00:18.480]   I wonder you can work longer in Garageband but I don't feel like I have the same level
[01:00:18.480 --> 01:00:19.480]   of control.
[01:00:19.480 --> 01:00:22.440]   It makes me so much the last time because I've been working with Auditions since it was cool
[01:00:22.440 --> 01:00:23.840]   at it back in '88.
[01:00:23.840 --> 01:00:24.840]   I agree.
[01:00:24.840 --> 01:00:26.440]   I could do Audition like-- you know what I use?
[01:00:26.440 --> 01:00:29.240]   Come to think of it as Amadeus Pro.
[01:00:29.240 --> 01:00:30.240]   Have you tried Amadeus?
[01:00:30.240 --> 01:00:31.240]   I have not.
[01:00:31.240 --> 01:00:32.240]   Rock me.
[01:00:32.240 --> 01:00:33.240]   Amadeus.
[01:00:33.240 --> 01:00:39.480]   Let me see if it's in the App Store.
[01:00:39.480 --> 01:00:41.960]   It's like 40 bucks and it's-- you know what?
[01:00:41.960 --> 01:00:47.840]   The reason that we use Audition is because we just want the waveform, right?
[01:00:47.840 --> 01:00:55.560]   We want to be able to-- there's a few things like marking and that are different but it
[01:00:55.560 --> 01:00:56.560]   is really good.
[01:00:56.560 --> 01:01:00.760]   Amadeus Pro, I don't know if you can download a trial version.
[01:01:00.760 --> 01:01:05.320]   They have a light version that's 25 bucks but this is what I use for all my radio ads
[01:01:05.320 --> 01:01:08.640]   now and all my audio editing on the radio.
[01:01:08.640 --> 01:01:10.240]   It's very similar.
[01:01:10.240 --> 01:01:11.240]   Okay.
[01:01:11.240 --> 01:01:12.240]   You know, it hurt.
[01:01:12.240 --> 01:01:14.360]   It was painful to making the transition.
[01:01:14.360 --> 01:01:15.360]   Yeah.
[01:01:15.360 --> 01:01:17.360]   I've tried several different things.
[01:01:17.360 --> 01:01:21.680]   I mean, for a long time, when I first got-- I had an iMac several years ago that I actually
[01:01:21.680 --> 01:01:26.400]   ran parallel's desktop on so that I could keep running Adobe Audition when it was only
[01:01:26.400 --> 01:01:29.840]   a Windows program and then for some reason I got off that.
[01:01:29.840 --> 01:01:34.760]   I think it was-- since I was doing a Mac show, I sort of felt like I should try doing this
[01:01:34.760 --> 01:01:37.120]   in just an all-apple environment.
[01:01:37.120 --> 01:01:38.120]   Yeah.
[01:01:38.120 --> 01:01:41.640]   So I can't remember what I was using Soundtrack Pro I think first and then I might have switched
[01:01:41.640 --> 01:01:44.480]   to GarageBand just to see if I could do it and I think there might have been one of
[01:01:44.480 --> 01:01:46.200]   the other program in there.
[01:01:46.200 --> 01:01:51.120]   But the day they came out with Adobe Audition for the Mac, I was back on it.
[01:01:51.120 --> 01:01:52.120]   Yeah.
[01:01:52.120 --> 01:01:53.120]   I mean, just this could be--
[01:01:53.120 --> 01:01:54.120]   Me too.
[01:01:54.120 --> 01:01:57.840]   It was like-- I mean, it was like putting on an old comfortable pair of shoes.
[01:01:57.840 --> 01:02:03.200]   And so the idea of taking them off again, I almost want to just keep this machine as
[01:02:03.200 --> 01:02:06.120]   an homage to whatever it's running now.
[01:02:06.120 --> 01:02:09.680]   And then, you know, by my next machine, I'll go ahead and start upgrading everything.
[01:02:09.680 --> 01:02:16.160]   Using the chatroom using Audition with Mavericks.
[01:02:16.160 --> 01:02:18.480]   Here's another one, Roga Miba makes one called Fission.
[01:02:18.480 --> 01:02:21.440]   I have not tried.
[01:02:21.440 --> 01:02:24.920]   This doesn't really look like it's what you want.
[01:02:24.920 --> 01:02:28.080]   It's more like for splitting and joining, I would guess.
[01:02:28.080 --> 01:02:29.240]   I would try Amadeus.
[01:02:29.240 --> 01:02:34.200]   I think they have a free download on the website, a trial download.
[01:02:34.200 --> 01:02:36.920]   It's not the same, but it's close.
[01:02:36.920 --> 01:02:40.680]   And I say this is a cool edit pro and Audition user for many years.
[01:02:40.680 --> 01:02:44.440]   And just like you, I did it on Windows because I had to.
[01:02:44.440 --> 01:02:45.440]   Yeah.
[01:02:45.440 --> 01:02:48.000]   Oh, here's some good news.
[01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:52.200]   Ashton Kutcher's jobs, the movie, is finally available on the iTunes Store.
[01:02:52.200 --> 01:02:55.480]   They're saying it works fine in 10.9, at least some people in chat rooms.
[01:02:55.480 --> 01:02:56.480]   10.9 works.
[01:02:56.480 --> 01:02:57.480]   Really?
[01:02:57.480 --> 01:02:58.480]   Yeah.
[01:02:58.480 --> 01:03:02.480]   The reason I don't use Audacity, which is great, is that if it ever crashes, which it
[01:03:02.480 --> 01:03:05.320]   does, and you lose your stuff, it's really sad.
[01:03:05.320 --> 01:03:06.320]   Yes.
[01:03:06.320 --> 01:03:07.320]   Actually, that was one.
[01:03:07.320 --> 01:03:08.320]   I was using that.
[01:03:08.320 --> 01:03:09.320]   I can't remember.
[01:03:09.320 --> 01:03:10.320]   That was when I was doing GarageBand.
[01:03:10.320 --> 01:03:14.680]   I think I was actually recording Audacity because it was very easy to just trim the waveform,
[01:03:14.680 --> 01:03:15.680]   as you say.
[01:03:15.680 --> 01:03:16.680]   Right.
[01:03:16.680 --> 01:03:19.920]   And then I was dropping it into GarageBand for the multi-track so I could do the intro
[01:03:19.920 --> 01:03:24.160]   and out music without actually having to play it in real time.
[01:03:24.160 --> 01:03:25.160]   And yeah.
[01:03:25.160 --> 01:03:26.160]   Yeah.
[01:03:26.160 --> 01:03:27.160]   One crash.
[01:03:27.160 --> 01:03:28.160]   Last edit.
[01:03:28.160 --> 01:03:29.160]   Yeah.
[01:03:29.160 --> 01:03:30.160]   Last edit.
[01:03:30.160 --> 01:03:31.160]   And you're like, oh, I'm so excited.
[01:03:31.160 --> 01:03:32.160]   I'm very close to going to.
[01:03:32.160 --> 01:03:33.160]   Yeah.
[01:03:33.160 --> 01:03:34.720]   That's the word I said too.
[01:03:34.720 --> 01:03:38.960]   So there is a trial on the website, which is hairsoft.com.
[01:03:38.960 --> 01:03:41.320]   How soft.com.
[01:03:41.320 --> 01:03:44.840]   And it also works very well.
[01:03:44.840 --> 01:03:48.360]   It supports VST plugins though, so if you have all your audition plugins, we'll continue
[01:03:48.360 --> 01:03:50.520]   to work, which is nice.
[01:03:50.520 --> 01:03:53.920]   And Apple's Audio Units.
[01:03:53.920 --> 01:03:58.280]   Never found a compression tool as good as auditions though.
[01:03:58.280 --> 01:04:02.840]   We use now-- I don't do any more editing on the big shows.
[01:04:02.840 --> 01:04:05.040]   We do it all in final cut of all things.
[01:04:05.040 --> 01:04:07.440]   They do the video.
[01:04:07.440 --> 01:04:09.080]   This makes sense if you're doing video and audio.
[01:04:09.080 --> 01:04:11.000]   You do the video edits and then you extract the audio.
[01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:12.000]   That's what I do now too.
[01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:15.240]   Do we chat post-process the audio with compression?
[01:04:15.240 --> 01:04:18.880]   Because that's something I prided myself on is using--
[01:04:18.880 --> 01:04:22.320]   Not post-process, but the axia has--
[01:04:22.320 --> 01:04:23.320]   Anything going on?
[01:04:23.320 --> 01:04:24.320]   Same.
[01:04:24.320 --> 01:04:27.160]   Real time is not as ever as good as post-processing.
[01:04:27.160 --> 01:04:28.160]   Yeah.
[01:04:28.160 --> 01:04:30.360]   That's one that we lost.
[01:04:30.360 --> 01:04:31.360]   Yeah.
[01:04:31.360 --> 01:04:36.080]   When I did the audio processing, I used-- Audition has a very nice compression tool.
[01:04:36.080 --> 01:04:37.920]   You can do a nice curve.
[01:04:37.920 --> 01:04:41.760]   And I had a dedicated curve that I think gave this-- if you listened to the earlier
[01:04:41.760 --> 01:04:48.200]   podcasts, the punch that was almost a trademark of the earlier Twitch shows.
[01:04:48.200 --> 01:04:52.800]   And yeah, I realized that we lost that a long time ago.
[01:04:52.800 --> 01:04:53.800]   So if you're working on final--
[01:04:53.800 --> 01:04:54.800]   Let's bring it back.
[01:04:54.800 --> 01:04:56.040]   Get a curve from Leo.
[01:04:56.040 --> 01:04:57.040]   We should.
[01:04:57.040 --> 01:04:59.240]   I had a good curve.
[01:04:59.240 --> 01:05:02.440]   George Forge is still around from Sony.
[01:05:02.440 --> 01:05:05.280]   I had the guy who did sound for-- or maybe he did acid.
[01:05:05.280 --> 01:05:08.360]   He was in the studio a couple of weeks ago visiting us.
[01:05:08.360 --> 01:05:10.520]   Anyway, let's get back to the more important story.
[01:05:10.520 --> 01:05:12.800]   Jobs the movie by Ashton Kutcher.
[01:05:12.800 --> 01:05:15.000]   Did any of you ever go see-- I saw it.
[01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:16.000]   Yeah, I saw it.
[01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:17.240]   In the theater.
[01:05:17.240 --> 01:05:18.240]   We kind of had to--
[01:05:18.240 --> 01:05:19.240]   I had to--
[01:05:19.240 --> 01:05:20.240]   --converiderated horrible movie.
[01:05:20.240 --> 01:05:21.240]   Horrible.
[01:05:21.240 --> 01:05:24.120]   I was trying to think about which is the more pathetic act.
[01:05:24.120 --> 01:05:30.000]   The act of paying $20 to see it or the act of paying just $10,
[01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:33.320]   but having to leave your house to do it.
[01:05:33.320 --> 01:05:38.800]   It was just-- you could edit that down to a really funny 20-minute,
[01:05:38.800 --> 01:05:39.680]   funnier dive video.
[01:05:39.680 --> 01:05:40.520]   Yes.
[01:05:40.520 --> 01:05:45.000]   Because your mouth is-- your jaw is just dropping a little bit
[01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:51.200]   that anybody thought that these lines would be ever spoken by any human being ever--
[01:05:51.200 --> 01:05:53.200]   His walk still gives me nightmares.
[01:05:53.200 --> 01:05:55.200]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:05:55.200 --> 01:05:57.160]   And there are some good performances in there.
[01:05:57.160 --> 01:05:59.000]   There are a lot of actors that are doing a good job
[01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:01.560]   despite having really nothing to--
[01:06:01.560 --> 01:06:02.560]   --learned with.
[01:06:02.560 --> 01:06:05.480]   It's-- yeah, I mean, I don't even want
[01:06:05.480 --> 01:06:08.320]   to make fun of Ashton Kutcher because he's--
[01:06:08.320 --> 01:06:14.000]   It's hard to say that anybody could have made a great performance out of that.
[01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:17.520]   I think that that would have been-- you get to graduate with honors.
[01:06:17.520 --> 01:06:22.280]   If Julie artists know whether they're going to graduate you normally or like cum laude,
[01:06:22.280 --> 01:06:24.440]   they say, OK, here's a page of dialogue.
[01:06:24.440 --> 01:06:25.520]   You are Steve Jobs.
[01:06:25.520 --> 01:06:26.720]   You are tripping on acid.
[01:06:26.720 --> 01:06:29.640]   You're lying on a field and saying the following line.
[01:06:29.640 --> 01:06:34.000]   What sort of mad and woman would give away their only son to strangers
[01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:35.320]   and make me believe it?
[01:06:35.320 --> 01:06:35.840]   Go.
[01:06:35.840 --> 01:06:37.320]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:06:37.320 --> 01:06:39.400]   It's like-- and we will give you the university
[01:06:39.400 --> 01:06:40.920]   if you can make that happen.
[01:06:40.920 --> 01:06:45.600]   I think if you see the trailer, which is available on IMOR's website,
[01:06:45.600 --> 01:06:47.480]   you really saw the best of it.
[01:06:47.480 --> 01:06:48.000]   Yes.
[01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:49.600]   That's it.
[01:06:49.600 --> 01:06:51.440]   Just watch the-- if I-- let's start--
[01:06:51.440 --> 01:06:54.160]   This is-- there's some good moments in here.
[01:06:54.160 --> 01:06:56.360]   The first-- there's the first apple.
[01:06:56.360 --> 01:06:57.040]   Steve?
[01:06:57.040 --> 01:06:58.320]   Wow.
[01:06:58.320 --> 01:06:59.480]   Wow.
[01:06:59.480 --> 01:07:00.000]   Oh, wow.
[01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:01.520]   Welcome to Apple Computer.
[01:07:01.520 --> 01:07:01.960]   Can we still--
[01:07:01.960 --> 01:07:03.920]   Some of these moments are cool, right?
[01:07:03.920 --> 01:07:05.800]   The garage.
[01:07:05.800 --> 01:07:07.200]   You can just watch what a computer is.
[01:07:07.200 --> 01:07:07.800]   Yeah, that's fun.
[01:07:07.800 --> 01:07:08.800]   Yeah, quickly.
[01:07:08.800 --> 01:07:09.960]   And there's Mike Markola.
[01:07:09.960 --> 01:07:10.800]   This is everything.
[01:07:10.800 --> 01:07:12.560]   Start up.
[01:07:12.560 --> 01:07:14.120]   You expecting something else?
[01:07:14.120 --> 01:07:17.080]   Maybe something a little less man's and family.
[01:07:17.080 --> 01:07:19.680]   Some good ones.
[01:07:19.680 --> 01:07:22.120]   This is the moment that never happened,
[01:07:22.120 --> 01:07:24.400]   but I love the staging of it, which
[01:07:24.400 --> 01:07:28.320]   is where Steve announces the Apple 2 computer
[01:07:28.320 --> 01:07:29.800]   at the West Coast Computer Fair.
[01:07:29.800 --> 01:07:31.720]   This never happened.
[01:07:31.720 --> 01:07:32.520]   Ever.
[01:07:32.520 --> 01:07:34.800]   There was no moment where people gathered around and Steve Jobs
[01:07:34.800 --> 01:07:38.280]   said, doing kind of a proto keynote.
[01:07:38.280 --> 01:07:40.000]   I've talked to people who were there and said,
[01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:40.960]   that didn't happen.
[01:07:40.960 --> 01:07:43.160]   However, it looked a lot like the West Coast Computer Fair,
[01:07:43.160 --> 01:07:46.600]   which I've been to my early days, a lot of us had.
[01:07:46.600 --> 01:07:48.960]   And so it was kind of fun to get to see
[01:07:48.960 --> 01:07:51.240]   what could have been the West Coast Computer Fair.
[01:07:51.240 --> 01:07:52.840]   But this is an imaginary scene.
[01:07:52.840 --> 01:07:54.280]   It's based on a real story.
[01:07:54.280 --> 01:07:57.040]   As is the imaginary scene where Woz puts apples.
[01:07:57.040 --> 01:07:58.520]   Yes.
[01:07:58.520 --> 01:07:59.320]   What's the matter?
[01:07:59.320 --> 01:08:00.320]   Really?
[01:08:00.320 --> 01:08:03.840]   The best way to explain it is it really is like fan fiction.
[01:08:03.840 --> 01:08:04.640]   It's fan fiction.
[01:08:04.640 --> 01:08:06.280]   If you're writing, and you guys-- oh, I
[01:08:06.280 --> 01:08:07.760]   got to have the scene where he's tripping on acid,
[01:08:07.760 --> 01:08:09.800]   and I got to have the scene where he breaks up with Woz.
[01:08:09.800 --> 01:08:11.360]   I got to have the scene where he's thrown out.
[01:08:11.360 --> 01:08:14.000]   I got to have the scene where he's-- they beg him to come back.
[01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:15.960]   And I got to have the scene where he just gets--
[01:08:15.960 --> 01:08:17.160]   it's like, oh, dear.
[01:08:17.160 --> 01:08:17.680]   What about next?
[01:08:17.680 --> 01:08:18.680]   None of that.
[01:08:18.680 --> 01:08:19.680]   There's no next.
[01:08:19.680 --> 01:08:21.360]   There's no Pixar in it.
[01:08:21.360 --> 01:08:22.360]   No, Pixar.
[01:08:22.360 --> 01:08:23.360]   No.
[01:08:23.360 --> 01:08:25.400]   And after-- and after--
[01:08:25.400 --> 01:08:28.560]   was a cocky who was the advisor on this movie?
[01:08:28.560 --> 01:08:29.440]   They had one insider--
[01:08:29.440 --> 01:08:30.440]   It was Dan cocky.
[01:08:30.440 --> 01:08:31.680]   --was Dan cocky.
[01:08:31.680 --> 01:08:34.840]   And you can tell that there's lots and lots of detail,
[01:08:34.840 --> 01:08:37.640]   detail, detail, detail, detail, until the big,
[01:08:37.640 --> 01:08:40.200]   tearful scene in which cocky says, I'm a--
[01:08:40.200 --> 01:08:41.320]   a lot like Bushkin.
[01:08:41.320 --> 01:08:43.280]   It's like, I have to leave now.
[01:08:43.280 --> 01:08:43.720]   And I'm sorry.
[01:08:43.720 --> 01:08:45.120]   You screwed me out of--
[01:08:45.120 --> 01:08:46.520]   I'm not quoting anything about the scene
[01:08:46.520 --> 01:08:48.360]   which was not given stock options.
[01:08:48.360 --> 01:08:51.560]   He realizes that his faith might have been misapplied here.
[01:08:51.560 --> 01:08:52.280]   And he leaves.
[01:08:52.280 --> 01:08:56.200]   And after that point is where he-- where the real cocky no longer
[01:08:56.200 --> 01:08:58.760]   has firsthand information is where--
[01:08:58.760 --> 01:09:01.600]   and now we enter the hour-long part where--
[01:09:01.600 --> 01:09:03.680]   and now I'm going to file this paperwork to sue you.
[01:09:03.680 --> 01:09:06.080]   Well, I'm serving these papers on you.
[01:09:06.080 --> 01:09:08.400]   Well, the corporation I'm filing, exactly.
[01:09:08.400 --> 01:09:10.280]   It's like fast forward.
[01:09:10.280 --> 01:09:12.920]   To me, the one of the best Steve Jobs movies
[01:09:12.920 --> 01:09:15.760]   that the biopics you can make, not just the one
[01:09:15.760 --> 01:09:18.440]   that Adam Sorkin is working on, which
[01:09:18.440 --> 01:09:21.880]   just focuses on three significant keynote events,
[01:09:21.880 --> 01:09:24.560]   which is also a good approach.
[01:09:24.560 --> 01:09:27.280]   What I want to see is just a movie that talks about his time
[01:09:27.280 --> 01:09:30.360]   at Next because as an outsider observer,
[01:09:30.360 --> 01:09:33.480]   as a fan of the character of Steve Jobs, which is what almost
[01:09:33.480 --> 01:09:35.320]   all of us on our planet are, not people who knew him,
[01:09:35.320 --> 01:09:37.840]   but people who are interested in this fictional character
[01:09:37.840 --> 01:09:40.440]   we have in our minds, the idea that he came into Next
[01:09:40.440 --> 01:09:43.080]   as this one person and came out of Next as seemingly
[01:09:43.080 --> 01:09:44.680]   another person, that's--
[01:09:44.680 --> 01:09:46.680]   I really want to see the transformation that happened.
[01:09:46.680 --> 01:09:47.320]   That's a story, yeah.
[01:09:47.320 --> 01:09:49.080]   Right there is a story.
[01:09:49.080 --> 01:09:51.520]   And that's actually-- that was the period.
[01:09:51.520 --> 01:09:53.080]   The only time I spent any time with Steve
[01:09:53.080 --> 01:09:56.080]   was spent the weekend with him during that time when he was
[01:09:56.080 --> 01:09:58.000]   at Pixar just before Apple rehired him,
[01:09:58.000 --> 01:09:59.640]   like six months before Apple rehired him.
[01:09:59.640 --> 01:10:05.080]   And he was a bitter man, but also still genius.
[01:10:05.080 --> 01:10:06.960]   And one of the things that he talked a lot about
[01:10:06.960 --> 01:10:08.760]   is what Apple could have done and should have done and should
[01:10:08.760 --> 01:10:09.480]   do.
[01:10:09.480 --> 01:10:12.480]   He had not stopped thinking about Apple for one minute
[01:10:12.480 --> 01:10:14.880]   in that time wandering in the wilderness.
[01:10:14.880 --> 01:10:18.400]   Here's Aaron Sorkin talking about the movie.
[01:10:18.400 --> 01:10:19.680]   What is that coming out?
[01:10:19.680 --> 01:10:21.920]   It should be 2014, I think.
[01:10:21.920 --> 01:10:22.880]   I don't know.
[01:10:22.880 --> 01:10:26.160]   I think that it's not in limbo, but it's
[01:10:26.160 --> 01:10:27.760]   one of those places where it's not--
[01:10:27.760 --> 01:10:29.040]   I don't think it started shooting yet.
[01:10:29.040 --> 01:10:31.320]   They're trying to get as much distance from the Ash to
[01:10:31.320 --> 01:10:32.440]   Kutcher film as possible.
[01:10:32.440 --> 01:10:33.320]   Oh, no, who's it going to cast?
[01:10:33.320 --> 01:10:34.560]   That's going to be a big question.
[01:10:34.560 --> 01:10:36.720]   Yeah, they haven't cast it yet.
[01:10:36.720 --> 01:10:38.960]   Tell us how you're going to be conceiving this character of
[01:10:38.960 --> 01:10:39.280]   Jobs.
[01:10:39.280 --> 01:10:41.880]   I mean, he really seemed to--
[01:10:41.880 --> 01:10:42.080]   Tected.
[01:10:42.080 --> 01:10:42.960]   --it was a genius.
[01:10:42.960 --> 01:10:45.600]   And yet, as we know, a very flawed genius.
[01:10:45.600 --> 01:10:49.520]   So how are you thinking about Jobs?
[01:10:49.520 --> 01:10:52.040]   Well, first, there's no point in writing about someone
[01:10:52.040 --> 01:10:54.560]   unless they're flawed.
[01:10:54.560 --> 01:10:56.120]   I agree.
[01:10:56.120 --> 01:11:00.720]   Perfect people who probably don't exist aren't that interesting.
[01:11:00.720 --> 01:11:01.440]   Is it that Bible?
[01:11:01.440 --> 01:11:03.120]   That was the one book about--
[01:11:03.120 --> 01:11:04.800]   But that explains too, and doesn't it?
[01:11:04.800 --> 01:11:05.960]   Also, don't exist.
[01:11:05.960 --> 01:11:07.600]   There's no such thing as a typical person.
[01:11:07.600 --> 01:11:14.000]   So Steve, I don't know if you knew him or not, was certainly
[01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:18.920]   atypical and a genius and extremely difficult.
[01:11:18.920 --> 01:11:20.800]   And you didn't know him quite well, right?
[01:11:20.800 --> 01:11:21.200]   I'm sorry?
[01:11:21.200 --> 01:11:22.080]   You didn't know him?
[01:11:22.080 --> 01:11:22.560]   No, he didn't.
[01:11:22.560 --> 01:11:23.080]   No.
[01:11:23.080 --> 01:11:25.080]   No, he didn't.
[01:11:25.080 --> 01:11:28.440]   We knew each other over the phone.
[01:11:28.440 --> 01:11:33.600]   He would call me from time to time out of the blue just to
[01:11:33.600 --> 01:11:37.840]   compliment me on something he had just seen.
[01:11:37.840 --> 01:11:44.120]   And then the second to last time I spoke to him was he asked
[01:11:44.120 --> 01:11:46.960]   if I would help him with the Stanford commencement address.
[01:11:46.960 --> 01:11:47.880]   The last time I spoke to him--
[01:11:47.880 --> 01:11:49.040]   That's an interesting story, yeah.
[01:11:49.040 --> 01:11:52.560]   --to write a Pixar movie.
[01:11:52.560 --> 01:12:00.880]   And I had told him that I love Pixar, that I'd never seen a
[01:12:00.880 --> 01:12:05.680]   studio make this kind of difference in movie making.
[01:12:05.680 --> 01:12:08.760]   These were tremendous accomplishments in movies.
[01:12:08.760 --> 01:12:11.280]   But that I didn't think I would be able to make an
[01:12:11.280 --> 01:12:13.320]   inanimate object talk.
[01:12:13.320 --> 01:12:15.440]   And he said once you make them talk, they won't be an
[01:12:15.440 --> 01:12:19.280]   inanimate anymore.
[01:12:19.280 --> 01:12:25.000]   But it was the way he said it that was so interesting to me.
[01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:27.680]   It was all but--
[01:12:27.680 --> 01:12:31.600]   He might as well have said, are you stupid?
[01:12:31.600 --> 01:12:32.200]   That's Steve.
[01:12:32.200 --> 01:12:34.480]   Anything that came out of Steve's mouth had that kind of
[01:12:34.480 --> 01:12:35.560]   subtext.
[01:12:35.560 --> 01:12:37.040]   Are you a moron?
[01:12:37.040 --> 01:12:39.320]   Do you not get what's going on here?
[01:12:39.320 --> 01:12:40.040]   There's more on this.
[01:12:40.040 --> 01:12:42.160]   This is Tina.
[01:12:42.160 --> 01:12:44.560]   Can't remember her last name at the Daily Beast, which was
[01:12:44.560 --> 01:12:47.400]   still at the Daily Beast interviewing Aaron Sorkin.
[01:12:47.400 --> 01:12:51.280]   It's something from about six months ago.
[01:12:51.280 --> 01:12:52.680]   So apparently he's going to do--
[01:12:52.680 --> 01:12:54.880]   everybody says just--
[01:12:54.880 --> 01:12:57.720]   he'll be backstage at three big keynotes.
[01:12:57.720 --> 01:13:02.080]   Three 30-minute scenes from Steve Jobs' life in this movie.
[01:13:02.080 --> 01:13:03.080]   That's an interesting structure.
[01:13:03.080 --> 01:13:04.280]   I don't--
[01:13:04.280 --> 01:13:08.200]   remember, don't forget that Aaron Sorkin loves flashbacks.
[01:13:08.200 --> 01:13:09.800]   I think that that does not necessarily--
[01:13:09.800 --> 01:13:11.320]   I think that may be the structure, but it may not
[01:13:11.320 --> 01:13:13.240]   eliminate scenes from elsewhere.
[01:13:13.240 --> 01:13:14.360]   But it's like sports night and--
[01:13:14.360 --> 01:13:16.360]   It was all the stuff that's always behind the scenes of--
[01:13:16.360 --> 01:13:17.320]   Right.
[01:13:17.320 --> 01:13:17.680]   Right.
[01:13:17.680 --> 01:13:22.520]   And I suspect that what will happen is you'll see Steve
[01:13:22.520 --> 01:13:25.880]   pondering and then maybe some flashbacks to moments
[01:13:25.880 --> 01:13:28.720]   from other times.
[01:13:28.720 --> 01:13:30.880]   Yeah, I've never-- whenever I see biopics,
[01:13:30.880 --> 01:13:32.760]   I think the ones that try to start at the beginning
[01:13:32.760 --> 01:13:33.560]   and at the end of the--
[01:13:33.560 --> 01:13:34.360]   Yeah, it's very hard.
[01:13:34.360 --> 01:13:39.080]   You only-- unless you're making a 38 to 61 year long movie,
[01:13:39.080 --> 01:13:39.880]   that's not going to work.
[01:13:39.880 --> 01:13:42.000]   You need to find something that is emblematic or something
[01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:44.200]   that you can decide what you need to tell people
[01:13:44.200 --> 01:13:46.720]   about this person and find one incident that you think
[01:13:46.720 --> 01:13:49.520]   encapsulates everything that you believe about this person.
[01:13:49.520 --> 01:13:51.680]   Sorkin says, it's like writing about the Beatles.
[01:13:51.680 --> 01:13:54.920]   It's a mind field of disappointment.
[01:13:54.920 --> 01:13:59.640]   Not for him, but that he will disappoint jobs fans like us
[01:13:59.640 --> 01:14:00.840]   as Ashton did.
[01:14:00.840 --> 01:14:02.200]   So much investment.
[01:14:02.200 --> 01:14:04.840]   It's very difficult to have a win on that, I think.
[01:14:04.840 --> 01:14:08.160]   That's why it's so important to identify Steve Jobs as a fictional
[01:14:08.160 --> 01:14:09.160]   character for--
[01:14:09.160 --> 01:14:09.640]   Exactly.
[01:14:09.640 --> 01:14:13.000]   --again, all but maybe a couple hundred people on this planet
[01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:15.560]   because we have our own images of who he was.
[01:14:15.560 --> 01:14:17.440]   Some of us are-- no people who knew him,
[01:14:17.440 --> 01:14:20.720]   but it's still sort of feeding on our perceptions of who he was.
[01:14:20.720 --> 01:14:27.520]   I mean, as a kid, Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak were just such huge names
[01:14:27.520 --> 01:14:30.320]   just growing up as a kid.
[01:14:30.320 --> 01:14:35.120]   I'll say it as big as Carl Jostrimsky and for Boston Red Sox kid.
[01:14:35.120 --> 01:14:36.000]   That's a lot.
[01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:36.960]   That's a big deal.
[01:14:36.960 --> 01:14:39.560]   And so for that reason, I'll learn things.
[01:14:39.560 --> 01:14:42.240]   I'll hear firsthand stories, but it will always be--
[01:14:42.240 --> 01:14:44.920]   I have to at least be aware of the fact
[01:14:44.920 --> 01:14:46.400]   that I've been thinking about these people as.
[01:14:46.400 --> 01:14:48.080]   And then they were in a garage.
[01:14:48.080 --> 01:14:51.400]   And then God struck to touch the goldering gun
[01:14:51.400 --> 01:14:53.720]   and soldering gun of Steve Wozniak.
[01:14:53.720 --> 01:15:00.800]   And he decided, yes, video across a TV composite.
[01:15:00.800 --> 01:15:03.480]   Yes, Jobs and Eric Clapton.
[01:15:03.480 --> 01:15:05.640]   There's the big three right there.
[01:15:05.640 --> 01:15:06.640]   Culture right there.
[01:15:06.640 --> 01:15:07.680]   That's a culture.
[01:15:07.680 --> 01:15:10.160]   I'd buy that album.
[01:15:10.160 --> 01:15:10.880]   Supergroup.
[01:15:10.880 --> 01:15:11.760]   Heck of a cover band.
[01:15:11.760 --> 01:15:15.280]   Supergroup.
[01:15:15.280 --> 01:15:17.320]   What else you guys want to talk about?
[01:15:17.320 --> 01:15:22.280]   Joni, in the midst of the tormented genius.
[01:15:22.280 --> 01:15:24.760]   I think we did Joni when we talked to Leander.
[01:15:24.760 --> 01:15:26.640]   And I haven't read the book yet.
[01:15:26.640 --> 01:15:30.160]   It's on my audible list.
[01:15:30.160 --> 01:15:32.600]   And you wonder why a figure like that
[01:15:32.600 --> 01:15:34.640]   decides that he doesn't want to give a lot of interviews.
[01:15:34.640 --> 01:15:36.520]   And he doesn't want to be really out there on stage.
[01:15:36.520 --> 01:15:40.400]   Because again, how many people are talking about Steve Jobs
[01:15:40.400 --> 01:15:41.440]   as though they know him?
[01:15:41.440 --> 01:15:44.920]   And now we're sort of looking around for other characters
[01:15:44.920 --> 01:15:48.840]   to replace the cast member that left after season 28.
[01:15:48.840 --> 01:15:52.480]   And he's entitled to have his own thoughts and his own opinions
[01:15:52.480 --> 01:15:56.000]   and allow his reality to be actual reality.
[01:15:56.000 --> 01:16:00.400]   From ZDNet, David Brough writing, "Apple Maps, World View,
[01:16:00.400 --> 01:16:04.280]   Now Better Than Google Maps."
[01:16:04.280 --> 01:16:05.320]   No idea what that means.
[01:16:05.320 --> 01:16:09.400]   I don't know what that means either.
[01:16:09.400 --> 01:16:11.880]   Yeah, I guess he's talking about mapping as a service,
[01:16:11.880 --> 01:16:14.280]   the idea that in Mavericks mapping--
[01:16:14.280 --> 01:16:15.920]   now that maps is in Mavericks, mapping
[01:16:15.920 --> 01:16:20.440]   may be integrated into more of the operating system.
[01:16:20.440 --> 01:16:21.000]   I don't know.
[01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:23.320]   Some of us are sending it from your computer to your phone.
[01:16:23.320 --> 01:16:24.720]   It's great.
[01:16:24.720 --> 01:16:25.720]   I read it.
[01:16:25.720 --> 01:16:28.440]   I'm not sure that I completely understood
[01:16:28.440 --> 01:16:29.920]   his justification for that statement.
[01:16:29.920 --> 01:16:32.560]   So I'm not going to really attack that conclusion.
[01:16:32.560 --> 01:16:33.840]   But the maze is--
[01:16:33.840 --> 01:16:34.440]   He's not Australian.
[01:16:34.440 --> 01:16:35.000]   We can't blame him.
[01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:38.480]   Well, the main point he seemed to be making
[01:16:38.480 --> 01:16:42.840]   is that Google Maps is not nearly as pretty as Apple Maps,
[01:16:42.840 --> 01:16:44.000]   which is true.
[01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:45.200]   It's more fun to play with this map.
[01:16:45.200 --> 01:16:46.840]   Mac Lucy is more important, however.
[01:16:46.840 --> 01:16:49.280]   And the fact that it is now ships--
[01:16:49.280 --> 01:16:52.360]   it's the default mapping app on every single iPhone
[01:16:52.360 --> 01:16:54.720]   and now ships on every single Mac.
[01:16:54.720 --> 01:16:56.960]   And now it's the mapping service that
[01:16:56.960 --> 01:17:00.600]   fuels every single Mac app that uses mapping.
[01:17:00.600 --> 01:17:03.040]   Mac users and iPhone users are simply
[01:17:03.040 --> 01:17:06.240]   going to be more interested in it and more faithful users of it
[01:17:06.240 --> 01:17:08.200]   than Google Maps, which is true.
[01:17:08.200 --> 01:17:10.280]   I think that there's a fundamental principle
[01:17:10.280 --> 01:17:13.000]   that we sometimes overlook, which
[01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:14.440]   is the good enough principle.
[01:17:14.440 --> 01:17:17.000]   As soon as the service or product is good enough,
[01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:20.080]   a lot of users are not going to be very interested in finding
[01:17:20.080 --> 01:17:22.040]   out why one might be better than the other,
[01:17:22.040 --> 01:17:26.560]   one might be better for them than a competing service.
[01:17:26.560 --> 01:17:29.600]   However, if you're looking for something
[01:17:29.600 --> 01:17:31.160]   to learn geography with, something
[01:17:31.160 --> 01:17:33.760]   to navigate-- it's to sort of get an idea of what
[01:17:33.760 --> 01:17:35.080]   the shape of a city is.
[01:17:35.080 --> 01:17:36.720]   I think that Apple Maps is better.
[01:17:36.720 --> 01:17:39.280]   But in the basic terms of I am here,
[01:17:39.280 --> 01:17:40.280]   I need to get there.
[01:17:40.280 --> 01:17:43.400]   And damn it, I need to be there by 3.30 PM
[01:17:43.400 --> 01:17:46.320]   because my meeting is at 3.45.
[01:17:46.320 --> 01:17:48.440]   I want Google Maps in my gun belt.
[01:17:48.440 --> 01:17:49.160]   I don't want Apple Maps.
[01:17:49.160 --> 01:17:50.920]   I've been trying Google Maps all weeks,
[01:17:50.920 --> 01:17:52.560]   because I've been here and I don't know the area at all.
[01:17:52.560 --> 01:17:53.960]   And I have no sense of direction.
[01:17:53.960 --> 01:17:54.200]   It's good.
[01:17:54.200 --> 01:17:56.120]   And I don't think any of them are good enough.
[01:17:56.120 --> 01:17:56.560]   Really?
[01:17:56.560 --> 01:17:59.120]   Apple Maps does some things very well.
[01:17:59.120 --> 01:18:01.040]   But getting me to the door that I want to go to
[01:18:01.040 --> 01:18:02.200]   is not one of them.
[01:18:02.200 --> 01:18:03.800]   The problem with Google Maps that I've been having
[01:18:03.800 --> 01:18:06.000]   is Apple Maps is better at saying, stay to the right,
[01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:08.360]   go to the left, and preparing me for where I have to go.
[01:18:08.360 --> 01:18:09.920]   So with Google Maps, I have less warning.
[01:18:09.920 --> 01:18:11.320]   So I'm more apt to make mistakes,
[01:18:11.320 --> 01:18:13.280]   because I'm all the way in the wrong lane.
[01:18:13.280 --> 01:18:14.840]   But also, I'm driving.
[01:18:14.840 --> 01:18:16.640]   And all of a sudden, it thinks I'm on the overpass.
[01:18:16.640 --> 01:18:19.560]   Or yesterday, it took me and my friend Phil.
[01:18:19.560 --> 01:18:22.280]   Google Maps recommended a route that took us an hour and a half
[01:18:22.280 --> 01:18:25.280]   to get from Palo Alto to San Jose.
[01:18:25.280 --> 01:18:26.800]   It just took us off the highway.
[01:18:26.800 --> 01:18:29.640]   And it did that this morning when I tried to come here.
[01:18:29.640 --> 01:18:31.000]   None of this stuff is good enough.
[01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:33.320]   I think we should be-- it's such an important service.
[01:18:33.320 --> 01:18:35.080]   We should be holding all these companies to a much higher
[01:18:35.080 --> 01:18:37.160]   standard.
[01:18:37.160 --> 01:18:38.040]   They're definitely good.
[01:18:38.040 --> 01:18:39.400]   But they could be a lot better.
[01:18:39.400 --> 01:18:40.840]   Mm.
[01:18:40.840 --> 01:18:42.520]   If you really want to appeal to Australians,
[01:18:42.520 --> 01:18:45.040]   just turn the map upside down.
[01:18:45.040 --> 01:18:46.760]   There's no reason Europe should be on top.
[01:18:46.760 --> 01:18:48.320]   That's only because Europeans made them.
[01:18:48.320 --> 01:18:49.560]   The Peterson projection.
[01:18:49.560 --> 01:18:50.160]   Yeah.
[01:18:50.160 --> 01:18:53.720]   It just reversed the damn thing.
[01:18:53.720 --> 01:18:55.400]   Wasn't that Aaron Sorkin wrote about that?
[01:18:55.400 --> 01:18:57.560]   It was the West Wing.
[01:18:57.560 --> 01:18:59.400]   It all comes back to Aaron Sorkin.
[01:18:59.400 --> 01:19:01.040]   It was a big block of cheesebag.
[01:19:01.040 --> 01:19:01.560]   Yes.
[01:19:01.560 --> 01:19:03.760]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:19:03.760 --> 01:19:05.760]   That is actually an excellent episode.
[01:19:05.760 --> 01:19:07.000]   Yes.
[01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:07.840]   Excellent series.
[01:19:07.840 --> 01:19:09.560]   You're telling me Germany isn't where I think it is?
[01:19:09.560 --> 01:19:10.320]   Andrew Nonsense.
[01:19:10.320 --> 01:19:13.160]   Had a big block of cheese.
[01:19:13.160 --> 01:19:18.200]   I invited all the people to come in and partake of it.
[01:19:18.200 --> 01:19:19.160]   Thanks, Leo.
[01:19:19.160 --> 01:19:20.920]   Wrong Leo.
[01:19:20.920 --> 01:19:22.000]   Yeah, Leo McGarry.
[01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:22.760]   Erleo, what?
[01:19:22.760 --> 01:19:23.840]   Yeah, Leo McGarry.
[01:19:23.840 --> 01:19:32.400]   So is the iPod dead, queries.imore.com?
[01:19:32.400 --> 01:19:34.480]   It's Chris Parsons writing for IMR.
[01:19:34.480 --> 01:19:36.480]   But you guys were talking about it on the--
[01:19:36.480 --> 01:19:36.920]   I'm more sure.
[01:19:36.920 --> 01:19:38.520]   We talked about that on the last earnings report
[01:19:38.520 --> 01:19:40.040]   when Apple didn't even have the iPod
[01:19:40.040 --> 01:19:41.680]   in the beginning of the--
[01:19:41.680 --> 01:19:42.760]   of the peer of the--
[01:19:42.760 --> 01:19:46.040]   And then nominally what used to be the iPod announcement
[01:19:46.040 --> 01:19:48.000]   in October or September?
[01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:49.520]   Not a word about an iPod.
[01:19:49.520 --> 01:19:51.240]   They got space gray in a press release.
[01:19:51.240 --> 01:19:52.240]   Yeah.
[01:19:52.240 --> 01:19:52.560]   Wrong.
[01:19:52.560 --> 01:19:53.080]   That was it.
[01:19:53.080 --> 01:19:57.200]   So I kind of think the iPod Touch is a viable product
[01:19:57.200 --> 01:19:58.920]   because it's an iPhone--
[01:19:58.920 --> 01:20:01.200]   or should be an iPhone minus phone.
[01:20:01.200 --> 01:20:04.360]   It's the only contract free way to get access
[01:20:04.360 --> 01:20:05.280]   to the iOS app library.
[01:20:05.280 --> 01:20:06.560]   So that's going to be a big deal.
[01:20:06.560 --> 01:20:08.400]   I also think that the cheapest one--
[01:20:08.400 --> 01:20:10.760]   I think there's always going to be a need for an iPod that
[01:20:10.760 --> 01:20:13.240]   has physical clickable controls because they're
[01:20:13.240 --> 01:20:15.440]   going to be people that-- if you're operating with gloves
[01:20:15.440 --> 01:20:17.920]   or if you need to, not be able to look at what you're doing
[01:20:17.920 --> 01:20:20.160]   while you're acting something, you're going to want that.
[01:20:20.160 --> 01:20:22.680]   Also, there are people who want an iPod that is--
[01:20:22.680 --> 01:20:25.640]   that is, I wouldn't say disposable $50 or $60
[01:20:25.640 --> 01:20:27.800]   isn't disposable income, at least not for me.
[01:20:27.800 --> 01:20:30.360]   But if it goes through the wash or if it gets lost,
[01:20:30.360 --> 01:20:33.640]   it's not the big deal that losing an iPhone would be.
[01:20:33.640 --> 01:20:34.920]   But it's kind of interesting.
[01:20:34.920 --> 01:20:39.120]   As let's look what happened today, the Moto G arrived in my office.
[01:20:39.120 --> 01:20:42.880]   And this is Motorola's $179 buy it
[01:20:42.880 --> 01:20:44.760]   and you own it, bring your own phone.
[01:20:44.760 --> 01:20:46.960]   And it suddenly occurred to me that--
[01:20:46.960 --> 01:20:49.520]   it's certainly not the best phone you can buy.
[01:20:49.520 --> 01:20:53.120]   But if you think of it as a $179 Android version
[01:20:53.120 --> 01:20:56.880]   of the iPod Touch, where $179, no contract, you own it,
[01:20:56.880 --> 01:20:59.200]   and you get access to the full Google Play Store,
[01:20:59.200 --> 01:21:03.160]   you get the very latest version of the operating system.
[01:21:03.160 --> 01:21:07.680]   And unlike the iPod Touch, which is much slimmer
[01:21:07.680 --> 01:21:10.640]   and more expensive, this actually has GPS in it.
[01:21:10.640 --> 01:21:12.560]   So you can actually use it for navigation.
[01:21:12.560 --> 01:21:18.920]   It's an interesting twist that the question is going to be,
[01:21:18.920 --> 01:21:21.440]   which is more important, having that Apple brand available
[01:21:21.440 --> 01:21:23.560]   at a low price point or making sure
[01:21:23.560 --> 01:21:26.200]   that anybody who wants iOS can get it with as few barriers
[01:21:26.200 --> 01:21:26.840]   as possible.
[01:21:26.840 --> 01:21:28.920]   It's kind of the conclusion you guys came to, right?
[01:21:28.920 --> 01:21:31.400]   Well, the touch was the only one that made any sense,
[01:21:31.400 --> 01:21:31.800]   I guess.
[01:21:31.800 --> 01:21:33.560]   The thing is, interesting, when you look at Apple's revenue
[01:21:33.560 --> 01:21:35.360]   for the iPod, it's just going down and down.
[01:21:35.360 --> 01:21:37.240]   And if the iPod Touch is still half the revenue
[01:21:37.240 --> 01:21:40.400]   from the iPod line, iPod Touch is going down and down as well.
[01:21:40.400 --> 01:21:41.400]   And that's counterintuitive.
[01:21:41.400 --> 01:21:43.080]   But when you look at something like the iPad Mini,
[01:21:43.080 --> 01:21:44.520]   which isn't that much more expensive,
[01:21:44.520 --> 01:21:45.520]   but is a much better experience--
[01:21:45.520 --> 01:21:47.240]   And the touch starts at 300 bucks.
[01:21:47.240 --> 01:21:48.600]   It's not cheap.
[01:21:48.600 --> 01:21:50.120]   And the $300 is now a little--
[01:21:50.120 --> 01:21:51.240]   $0.99, I think.
[01:21:51.240 --> 01:21:55.320]   And the 16 gigabyte is $229.
[01:21:55.320 --> 01:21:57.480]   $229 is just OK, sorry.
[01:21:57.480 --> 01:22:01.520]   Last generation iPad Mini is going for $299 now.
[01:22:01.520 --> 01:22:04.320]   And the iPod-- the iPhone C as much as it--
[01:22:04.320 --> 01:22:06.560]   5C as much as it's still a phone,
[01:22:06.560 --> 01:22:08.720]   Apple is positioning it in iPod packaging.
[01:22:08.720 --> 01:22:10.600]   And they wanted to sit on the shelf and be colorful
[01:22:10.600 --> 01:22:11.880]   and be that thing you buy.
[01:22:11.880 --> 01:22:14.440]   So as that is ramping down, I think Apple is ramping up
[01:22:14.440 --> 01:22:16.280]   on products to take its place.
[01:22:16.280 --> 01:22:19.560]   You made a good point, Andy, that the Moto G is less
[01:22:19.560 --> 01:22:23.040]   than the cheapest iPod Touch outright.
[01:22:23.040 --> 01:22:23.640]   Yeah.
[01:22:23.640 --> 01:22:26.360]   And at any point, you can slap a SIM card in it
[01:22:26.360 --> 01:22:26.840]   and actually--
[01:22:26.840 --> 01:22:27.640]   And now it's a phone.
[01:22:27.640 --> 01:22:28.640]   Yeah.
[01:22:28.640 --> 01:22:30.800]   But it's not-- but the people who would want something
[01:22:30.800 --> 01:22:33.080]   like that, I don't think this would be as desirable
[01:22:33.080 --> 01:22:34.800]   as an iPod Touch.
[01:22:34.800 --> 01:22:37.920]   Really, my only qualm about the iPod Touch at this point
[01:22:37.920 --> 01:22:41.520]   is that it does Apple care about this thing.
[01:22:41.520 --> 01:22:44.080]   Next year, is this device still going to be around?
[01:22:44.080 --> 01:22:47.560]   Or are they going to continue to aggressively upgrade it?
[01:22:47.560 --> 01:22:50.600]   Or is this going to be an orphan product like the iPod
[01:22:50.600 --> 01:22:54.720]   Classic where, yes, I suppose, technically, if you walk into the Apple
[01:22:54.720 --> 01:22:58.080]   Store and you really have a lot of endurance
[01:22:58.080 --> 01:23:00.680]   to convince someone who works there that, yes, you
[01:23:00.680 --> 01:23:01.840]   still buy this.
[01:23:01.840 --> 01:23:05.800]   And yes, you would not be committing--
[01:23:05.800 --> 01:23:10.760]   when we committing an inappropriate act by selling me one,
[01:23:10.760 --> 01:23:12.720]   it's just not a--
[01:23:12.720 --> 01:23:15.040]   Well, there'd be an iPhone side version at my time.
[01:23:15.040 --> 01:23:17.680]   I just wish we were getting more love from Apple.
[01:23:17.680 --> 01:23:18.240]   That's all.
[01:23:18.240 --> 01:23:21.360]   It makes me a little bit worried that that's not being promoted
[01:23:21.360 --> 01:23:23.000]   as the really cool, very important product.
[01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:23.440]   It is.
[01:23:23.440 --> 01:23:25.440]   We need a pocketable version of iOS.
[01:23:25.440 --> 01:23:29.000]   Your good point about how the price differential between the iPod
[01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:30.560]   Touch and the iPad Mini is not that great.
[01:23:30.560 --> 01:23:32.680]   But iPad Mini is still this honking big.
[01:23:32.680 --> 01:23:35.200]   You need something that is this honking big.
[01:23:35.200 --> 01:23:37.760]   My 10-year-old niece has an iPod Touch.
[01:23:37.760 --> 01:23:39.880]   And she has an iPod Touch because there's no way her parents are
[01:23:39.880 --> 01:23:41.120]   going to buy her a phone.
[01:23:41.120 --> 01:23:44.880]   And there's need an idea as what Andy's talking about with the--
[01:23:44.880 --> 01:23:46.560]   I'm sorry, was it the Moto G you said?
[01:23:46.560 --> 01:23:47.360]   Yeah.
[01:23:47.360 --> 01:23:49.760]   As need an idea as that is, of taking out the SIM card,
[01:23:49.760 --> 01:23:51.600]   that's not something that her parents are going to do.
[01:23:51.600 --> 01:23:54.560]   It's not even something that her parents are going to think about.
[01:23:54.560 --> 01:23:56.720]   There is one other thing to point out.
[01:23:56.720 --> 01:23:58.680]   Info, Scout, I guess, is the one that
[01:23:58.680 --> 01:24:01.760]   was sort of tracking different sales of different tablets
[01:24:01.760 --> 01:24:05.280]   and smartphones and things like that online.
[01:24:05.280 --> 01:24:06.760]   I want to say it was number 11.
[01:24:06.760 --> 01:24:08.640]   I honestly don't remember off the top of my head.
[01:24:08.640 --> 01:24:13.920]   But the 16-gigabyte iPod Touch was one of the top 20 selling
[01:24:13.920 --> 01:24:17.720]   items at Target on Black Friday.
[01:24:17.720 --> 01:24:19.960]   So I mean, it still got some place.
[01:24:19.960 --> 01:24:23.680]   Now, is that place in Walmart and in Target?
[01:24:23.680 --> 01:24:25.960]   Sort of like a bit of discoverability
[01:24:25.960 --> 01:24:28.280]   for people who, for whatever reason, are not going to walk into an Apple
[01:24:28.280 --> 01:24:29.360]   store, maybe.
[01:24:29.360 --> 01:24:30.200]   Is it just for kids?
[01:24:30.200 --> 01:24:31.080]   Maybe it's that too.
[01:24:31.080 --> 01:24:34.920]   But I mean, it's also kind of the gateway iOS device
[01:24:34.920 --> 01:24:36.320]   for some people.
[01:24:36.320 --> 01:24:40.600]   And then to Andy's point as well about the iPad many--
[01:24:40.600 --> 01:24:42.040]   that size is a huge deal.
[01:24:42.040 --> 01:24:43.440]   I mean, if you want to get your kids,
[01:24:43.440 --> 01:24:45.560]   somebody that can play music on,
[01:24:45.560 --> 01:24:47.400]   somebody that they're going to put in their pocket
[01:24:47.400 --> 01:24:49.600]   and go outside with, well, they're not going to do that
[01:24:49.600 --> 01:24:50.720]   with the iPad many.
[01:24:50.720 --> 01:24:53.120]   But they could certainly do it with the iPod Touch.
[01:24:53.120 --> 01:24:55.360]   And then it's just a notch to get them onto the phone.
[01:24:55.360 --> 01:24:57.200]   So I mean, at the very least, it sticks around.
[01:24:57.200 --> 01:25:00.120]   I mean, once those kids are old enough to, OK,
[01:25:00.120 --> 01:25:02.360]   well, I'm buying them their phone,
[01:25:02.360 --> 01:25:04.760]   they're already in the iOS ecosystem at that point.
[01:25:04.760 --> 01:25:09.520]   So the $99 iPhone 5C, or whatever it's called,
[01:25:09.520 --> 01:25:11.160]   by the time she's old enough to get one,
[01:25:11.160 --> 01:25:14.840]   is a natural move, it seems.
[01:25:14.840 --> 01:25:16.480]   Apple's only updating the iPod Touch
[01:25:16.480 --> 01:25:17.560]   is when they do a new iPhone.
[01:25:17.560 --> 01:25:19.360]   So the iPhone 5 had the new iPod Touch,
[01:25:19.360 --> 01:25:23.120]   and they'll do another one presumably when the iPhone 6 comes out.
[01:25:23.120 --> 01:25:24.160]   But my godchildren love it.
[01:25:24.160 --> 01:25:26.360]   They're five years old and eight years old.
[01:25:26.360 --> 01:25:27.920]   They'll be able to sit there with Duolingo,
[01:25:27.920 --> 01:25:29.480]   which you recommended on a previous show.
[01:25:29.480 --> 01:25:30.120]   Isn't it fun?
[01:25:30.120 --> 01:25:31.680]   They're learning-- they help with their French
[01:25:31.680 --> 01:25:32.680]   and helps them with it.
[01:25:32.680 --> 01:25:34.040]   They're learning Italian on it, too.
[01:25:34.040 --> 01:25:36.560]   And that's perfect for an iPod Touch.
[01:25:36.560 --> 01:25:37.440]   Yeah.
[01:25:37.440 --> 01:25:38.720]   I hope Apple sees that.
[01:25:38.720 --> 01:25:41.360]   Well, I think it's on a two-year upgrade cycle,
[01:25:41.360 --> 01:25:43.880]   not a one-year upgrade cycle like the iPhone.
[01:25:43.880 --> 01:25:45.960]   Yeah, but they could still have at least put it--
[01:25:45.960 --> 01:25:48.560]   just put in the group photo.
[01:25:48.560 --> 01:25:49.520]   I'm serious.
[01:25:49.520 --> 01:25:52.080]   I mean, when you got the group photo of everybody
[01:25:52.080 --> 01:25:53.400]   that you're proud of in the company,
[01:25:53.400 --> 01:25:56.480]   and you're the one person who was not on the email invite list,
[01:25:56.480 --> 01:25:58.760]   you got to think that it's time to update your profile
[01:25:58.760 --> 01:25:59.760]   in LinkedIn.
[01:25:59.760 --> 01:26:02.000]   And I just feel like there's a risk
[01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:03.800]   that this is getting an opportunity
[01:26:03.800 --> 01:26:06.280]   to less expensive Android devices.
[01:26:06.280 --> 01:26:08.160]   And the last thing you want to do
[01:26:08.160 --> 01:26:11.000]   is get Apple people out of the Apple ecosystem at all,
[01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:13.920]   because the risk is that they'll slowly migrate out of it.
[01:26:13.920 --> 01:26:15.680]   Last thing to keep seeing the market share surveys,
[01:26:15.680 --> 01:26:18.600]   Apple has 0% market share under $400 phones.
[01:26:18.600 --> 01:26:19.480]   Right.
[01:26:19.480 --> 01:26:20.280]   Because they don't make one.
[01:26:20.280 --> 01:26:22.120]   Yes.
[01:26:22.120 --> 01:26:24.040]   So the iPod Touch traditionally felt
[01:26:24.040 --> 01:26:24.920]   you know, folded in that void.
[01:26:24.920 --> 01:26:25.680]   Right.
[01:26:25.680 --> 01:26:27.160]   Did you catch the Kentar numbers, though,
[01:26:27.160 --> 01:26:33.040]   about who the big iPhone 5C buyers are?
[01:26:33.040 --> 01:26:34.000]   This was out yesterday.
[01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:36.000]   I can't remember if it was in Mackerel to the Telegraph
[01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:38.560]   or both, actually, I guess.
[01:26:38.560 --> 01:26:41.800]   But according to Kentar World Panel,
[01:26:41.800 --> 01:26:45.760]   half or almost half of the people who bought an iPhone 5C,
[01:26:45.760 --> 01:26:47.960]   the first month and a half that they were out,
[01:26:47.960 --> 01:26:49.480]   were switchers from Android.
[01:26:49.480 --> 01:26:50.600]   Android switchers.
[01:26:50.600 --> 01:26:52.280]   That's who's buying.
[01:26:52.280 --> 01:26:54.520]   You know, three times as many people are buying 5S
[01:26:54.520 --> 01:26:55.480]   than the 5C.
[01:26:55.480 --> 01:26:58.120]   But of the people who buy the 5C--
[01:26:58.120 --> 01:27:02.360]   It's an interesting idea.
[01:27:02.360 --> 01:27:05.360]   I mean, I wonder then what that's based on.
[01:27:05.360 --> 01:27:07.600]   Is it people have wanted the iPhone,
[01:27:07.600 --> 01:27:09.720]   but they couldn't justify spending $200.
[01:27:09.720 --> 01:27:11.920]   And they didn't want last year's model as well.
[01:27:11.920 --> 01:27:15.400]   I mean, I don't know what that move is kind of weird to me.
[01:27:15.400 --> 01:27:16.000]   The way it was--
[01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:16.680]   I mean, I think--
[01:27:16.680 --> 01:27:18.920]   I'm assuming those numbers hold a hop.
[01:27:18.920 --> 01:27:20.400]   I have a theory, but Lorenae was here
[01:27:20.400 --> 01:27:21.240]   for me for sure.
[01:27:21.240 --> 01:27:23.800]   The way it made sense to me was that the iPhone 5S
[01:27:23.800 --> 01:27:25.200]   is like the Blockbuster Summer movie.
[01:27:25.200 --> 01:27:26.120]   It comes out once a year.
[01:27:26.120 --> 01:27:27.400]   Tons of people go buy it.
[01:27:27.400 --> 01:27:29.360]   And then it kind of slowly declines until the next year,
[01:27:29.360 --> 01:27:31.840]   where the iPhone 5C was meant to be a TV series.
[01:27:31.840 --> 01:27:33.760]   That's just there week after week after week.
[01:27:33.760 --> 01:27:35.920]   And people come in and like it and buy it, you know,
[01:27:35.920 --> 01:27:36.920]   when they're on the--
[01:27:36.920 --> 01:27:39.960]   I think the 5C appeals to people when they hold it.
[01:27:39.960 --> 01:27:40.520]   Absolutely.
[01:27:40.520 --> 01:27:41.560]   Yeah.
[01:27:41.560 --> 01:27:44.800]   I thought that we're seeing a skew between how many people who
[01:27:44.800 --> 01:27:47.400]   buy just in general year to year, how many people who buy
[01:27:47.400 --> 01:27:51.880]   new iPhones are existing iPhone owners who are upgrading
[01:27:51.880 --> 01:27:54.120]   versus how many people just are naturally.
[01:27:54.120 --> 01:27:55.160]   I could buy any phone.
[01:27:55.160 --> 01:27:57.160]   I've decided to buy this phone this year.
[01:27:57.160 --> 01:28:00.840]   Because I don't think that anybody who is going from an iPhone
[01:28:00.840 --> 01:28:04.560]   4 or 4S or even a 3GS would say, I
[01:28:04.560 --> 01:28:07.720]   want the cheap plastic 5C $99 one.
[01:28:07.720 --> 01:28:09.520]   They will say, I'm an iPhone user.
[01:28:09.520 --> 01:28:12.960]   I want the real one, the $199 one.
[01:28:12.960 --> 01:28:14.800]   We're asking Android user which is simply--
[01:28:14.800 --> 01:28:18.880]   any switch to iPhone would be a remarkable enough upgrade
[01:28:18.880 --> 01:28:21.040]   that they wouldn't necessarily say, I definitely
[01:28:21.040 --> 01:28:22.400]   want the 5S.
[01:28:22.400 --> 01:28:25.840]   My 21-year-old daughter has a 4S,
[01:28:25.840 --> 01:28:28.640]   and she wants a 5C for Christmas.
[01:28:28.640 --> 01:28:30.480]   I heard a lot of geeks say that they wish they could get
[01:28:30.480 --> 01:28:32.560]   the 5S internals in a 5C body because they just
[01:28:32.560 --> 01:28:34.200]   love the way that plastic looks and feels.
[01:28:34.200 --> 01:28:36.760]   She says either pink or yellow.
[01:28:36.760 --> 01:28:39.800]   And I think I would guess-- this here's my theory, Andy,
[01:28:39.800 --> 01:28:44.080]   and Ken-- is that what happens is that this is the 5C appeals
[01:28:44.080 --> 01:28:47.160]   people who have not made a decision when they walk into a phone
[01:28:47.160 --> 01:28:47.680]   store.
[01:28:47.680 --> 01:28:50.520]   They aren't going in looking for any particular phone.
[01:28:50.520 --> 01:28:52.720]   They're just going in to get a phone.
[01:28:52.720 --> 01:28:53.880]   And they try them all.
[01:28:53.880 --> 01:28:54.880]   It's $99.
[01:28:54.880 --> 01:28:58.480]   They're not aware of the differentials and all of that.
[01:28:58.480 --> 01:28:59.400]   They're not aware of the--
[01:28:59.400 --> 01:29:00.680]   nor should they be.
[01:29:00.680 --> 01:29:01.800]   And they feel it.
[01:29:01.800 --> 01:29:02.160]   They hold it.
[01:29:02.160 --> 01:29:03.440]   They go, I like it.
[01:29:03.440 --> 01:29:04.040]   Oh, it's an iPhone.
[01:29:04.040 --> 01:29:05.120]   Yeah, that'd be good.
[01:29:05.120 --> 01:29:05.840]   I heard of that.
[01:29:05.840 --> 01:29:07.200]   I heard of that.
[01:29:07.200 --> 01:29:09.360]   It's not people like us who have a decision
[01:29:09.360 --> 01:29:11.200]   know what we want going in.
[01:29:11.200 --> 01:29:11.680]   Right.
[01:29:11.680 --> 01:29:13.600]   And there were a lot of the financial analysts
[01:29:13.600 --> 01:29:15.800]   that said that as soon as the iPhone 5C came out,
[01:29:15.800 --> 01:29:17.000]   not every one of them said that.
[01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:19.800]   I mean, certainly more of them said, oh, well, this thing's bad.
[01:29:19.800 --> 01:29:20.600]   This thing's terrible.
[01:29:20.600 --> 01:29:21.880]   This thing isn't selling.
[01:29:21.880 --> 01:29:23.560]   There were a few of the financial analysts, though,
[01:29:23.560 --> 01:29:25.640]   and certainly some industry analysts as well, who said,
[01:29:25.640 --> 01:29:27.520]   where this thing is really going to--
[01:29:27.520 --> 01:29:30.640]   where you're going to see how it's doing is around the holidays.
[01:29:30.640 --> 01:29:33.040]   When people are at the mall, they're
[01:29:33.040 --> 01:29:35.680]   going and they're ending up in Apple stores,
[01:29:35.680 --> 01:29:38.480]   or they're running up other places where they have these phones,
[01:29:38.480 --> 01:29:40.520]   and getting really just their first look at them.
[01:29:40.520 --> 01:29:42.920]   Because they weren't going to be the people that rushed out.
[01:29:42.920 --> 01:29:45.320]   I mean, there was nothing-- and the 5C wasn't really
[01:29:45.320 --> 01:29:47.520]   made for the people who were going to be rushing out, right?
[01:29:47.520 --> 01:29:51.520]   I mean, like you're saying, it was for the people who are,
[01:29:51.520 --> 01:29:54.520]   oh, it's time to get a phone, or it's time to replace my phone.
[01:29:54.520 --> 01:29:59.840]   Or it's time to finally get a smartphone.
[01:29:59.840 --> 01:30:02.040]   And by the way, Abby thinks the iPhone 5--
[01:30:02.040 --> 01:30:03.200]   The Galaxy is $1,000 for the holidays.
[01:30:03.200 --> 01:30:05.040]   5C is $99.
[01:30:05.040 --> 01:30:06.480]   She thinks it's $99.
[01:30:06.480 --> 01:30:07.200]   All you ever see?
[01:30:07.200 --> 01:30:07.720]   Yeah.
[01:30:07.720 --> 01:30:09.360]   She doesn't-- I said, well, you know, you're not
[01:30:09.360 --> 01:30:12.120]   due for an upgrade, so it's $600 to $500.
[01:30:12.120 --> 01:30:13.240]   She was shocked.
[01:30:13.240 --> 01:30:14.280]   Shocked, I tell you.
[01:30:14.280 --> 01:30:15.680]   Shocked to find out subsidies are going on
[01:30:15.680 --> 01:30:16.480]   with this establishment.
[01:30:16.480 --> 01:30:17.960]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:30:17.960 --> 01:30:19.080]   $99 phone, sir.
[01:30:19.080 --> 01:30:19.600]   Thank you.
[01:30:19.600 --> 01:30:20.840]   She says it's only $100.
[01:30:20.840 --> 01:30:22.280]   I want that phone.
[01:30:22.280 --> 01:30:23.480]   And I think that's more--
[01:30:23.480 --> 01:30:25.600]   I mean, she's probably more sophisticated than a lot of people.
[01:30:25.600 --> 01:30:27.360]   And I think that's a fairly normal reaction.
[01:30:27.360 --> 01:30:28.360]   Oh, it's $99.
[01:30:28.360 --> 01:30:28.880]   It's colorful.
[01:30:28.880 --> 01:30:29.880]   I'll take it.
[01:30:29.880 --> 01:30:30.380]   Yep.
[01:30:30.380 --> 01:30:33.160]   I think it's also a way-- we have to remind ourselves
[01:30:33.160 --> 01:30:35.200]   that I don't think that there are a lot of people for whom
[01:30:35.200 --> 01:30:36.760]   they don't know, and they don't care
[01:30:36.760 --> 01:30:39.360]   about the difference between a lot of different phones.
[01:30:39.360 --> 01:30:44.040]   But once a group of phone has the same kind of features,
[01:30:44.040 --> 01:30:46.680]   at that point it's like, oh, this one is in black.
[01:30:46.680 --> 01:30:47.600]   How about this other one?
[01:30:47.600 --> 01:30:48.720]   Also available only in black.
[01:30:48.720 --> 01:30:51.400]   Well, this one is available in black and silver.
[01:30:51.400 --> 01:30:52.920]   Well, this one is available in five colors.
[01:30:52.920 --> 01:30:53.240]   Oh, great.
[01:30:53.240 --> 01:30:54.080]   I'll take the red one.
[01:30:54.080 --> 01:30:55.760]   And that's what makes them want to get that one.
[01:30:55.760 --> 01:30:56.480]   That's right.
[01:30:56.480 --> 01:30:58.920]   It's a really consumer-y sort of device.
[01:30:58.920 --> 01:30:59.240]   Yep.
[01:30:59.240 --> 01:31:00.840]   It's meant to be popular.
[01:31:00.840 --> 01:31:03.080]   We're going to take a break, and then we'll
[01:31:03.080 --> 01:31:04.960]   take your picks of the week.
[01:31:04.960 --> 01:31:07.200]   Renee Ritchie from iMore.com.
[01:31:07.200 --> 01:31:11.040]   Mac OS Ken, Ken Ray from MacOSKen.com.
[01:31:11.040 --> 01:31:13.480]   And Andy Enoco from the Chicago Sun Times.
[01:31:13.480 --> 01:31:15.480]   Our show today brought to you by Smile Software.
[01:31:15.480 --> 01:31:18.480]   Those great guys at Smile and Gals, I should say,
[01:31:18.480 --> 01:31:21.240]   as Jim McDonald is definitely a gal.
[01:31:21.240 --> 01:31:25.200]   Have a new product, PDF Pen Scan Plus.
[01:31:25.200 --> 01:31:27.040]   Use your phone as a scanner.
[01:31:27.040 --> 01:31:27.720]   Take a picture.
[01:31:27.720 --> 01:31:31.760]   Turn it into a PDF and OCR it in a single step.
[01:31:31.760 --> 01:31:33.760]   Multi-page documents too.
[01:31:33.760 --> 01:31:35.480]   Then you can send it to the cloud
[01:31:35.480 --> 01:31:38.160]   or open it in a PDF pen.
[01:31:38.160 --> 01:31:39.000]   Add to it.
[01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:40.480]   Turn it into a form, whatever you want.
[01:31:40.480 --> 01:31:42.160]   It knows about edges.
[01:31:42.160 --> 01:31:43.800]   It does a great job.
[01:31:43.800 --> 01:31:45.560]   Get rid of the paper.
[01:31:45.560 --> 01:31:51.560]   I have in my parts closet a bunch of receipt scanning,
[01:31:51.560 --> 01:31:53.640]   the Scan Pro and stuff.
[01:31:53.640 --> 01:31:54.400]   This is so much easier.
[01:31:54.400 --> 01:31:57.400]   You just take a picture of it, OCR it, save it,
[01:31:57.400 --> 01:31:58.840]   and you got it.
[01:31:58.840 --> 01:32:01.560]   $4.99 right now on the App Store.
[01:32:01.560 --> 01:32:02.640]   I really like this.
[01:32:02.640 --> 01:32:05.480]   One touch scanning from your iPhone or your iPad camera.
[01:32:05.480 --> 01:32:08.400]   Use the OCR to convert it into searchable PDFs.
[01:32:08.400 --> 01:32:09.240]   The app does it.
[01:32:09.240 --> 01:32:11.880]   It's not uploading it to the cloud to do the OCR.
[01:32:11.880 --> 01:32:13.120]   So you don't have to be connected.
[01:32:13.120 --> 01:32:14.960]   This would be perfect for an iPod touch.
[01:32:14.960 --> 01:32:16.880]   Absolutely.
[01:32:16.880 --> 01:32:21.840]   16 languages supported in the optical character recognition.
[01:32:21.840 --> 01:32:24.120]   And the special price is limited time only.
[01:32:24.120 --> 01:32:24.800]   So get it now.
[01:32:24.800 --> 01:32:32.600]   $4.99 at smilesoftware.com/macbrae.
[01:32:32.600 --> 01:32:37.160]   Actually, if you go there, it'll put you to the App Store.
[01:32:37.160 --> 01:32:41.480]   smilesoftware.com/macbrae.
[01:32:41.480 --> 01:32:43.480]   Do go there, though, so that we get credit for the fact
[01:32:43.480 --> 01:32:47.160]   that you heard about it first on the Macbrae weekly.
[01:32:47.160 --> 01:32:49.280]   It's a really great idea.
[01:32:49.280 --> 01:32:52.800]   And the iPad app, it's universal.
[01:32:52.800 --> 01:32:56.600]   So it's not a blown up iPhone app.
[01:32:56.600 --> 01:32:58.720]   It works on the iPad just like a native--
[01:32:58.720 --> 01:33:01.160]   it is a native iPad app.
[01:33:01.160 --> 01:33:02.600]   And you could save your scans to iCloud.
[01:33:02.600 --> 01:33:05.920]   They're the one company that's figured out how iCloud works.
[01:33:05.920 --> 01:33:08.680]   I don't know how they got that work, and that's awesome.
[01:33:08.680 --> 01:33:12.080]   Also Dropbox, Evernote, and other cloud-based services.
[01:33:12.080 --> 01:33:12.880]   Thank you, smile.
[01:33:12.880 --> 01:33:20.080]   Another great product, smilesoftware.com/macbrae.
[01:33:20.080 --> 01:33:21.440]   Not smackbrae.
[01:33:21.440 --> 01:33:22.440]   Smackbrae.
[01:33:22.440 --> 01:33:23.680]   Macbrae.
[01:33:23.680 --> 01:33:25.920]   Smilesoftware.com/macbrae.
[01:33:25.920 --> 01:33:28.880]   Andy and Oco must have something wonderful up his sleeves.
[01:33:28.880 --> 01:33:30.480]   He always does.
[01:33:30.480 --> 01:33:31.680]   I think I do.
[01:33:31.680 --> 01:33:34.360]   I can't believe that I let this go this far.
[01:33:34.360 --> 01:33:37.320]   When we're talking about Apple's acquisition of Topsie
[01:33:37.320 --> 01:33:41.240]   and also mentioning Bob's burger, Topsie was the name
[01:33:41.240 --> 01:33:44.480]   of the elephant that Thomas Edison had electrocuted as a way
[01:33:44.480 --> 01:33:47.280]   to make that that alternating current was dangerous.
[01:33:47.280 --> 01:33:49.000]   Oh, you see, guess what they call it?
[01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:50.000]   They call it Topsie.
[01:33:50.000 --> 01:33:50.480]   A really cool song.
[01:33:50.480 --> 01:33:51.520]   Well, maybe.
[01:33:51.520 --> 01:33:53.640]   I'm just thinking that maybe we should force them
[01:33:53.640 --> 01:33:54.800]   to open up the papers on this.
[01:33:54.800 --> 01:33:57.080]   I don't know if they're going to be killing more animals.
[01:33:57.080 --> 01:33:58.720]   No more animals may die.
[01:33:58.720 --> 01:34:03.680]   Perhaps we're seeing a peek at Microsoft's new ad campaign.
[01:34:03.680 --> 01:34:05.080]   What is an Apple telling us?
[01:34:05.080 --> 01:34:06.560]   OK, about the other week.
[01:34:06.560 --> 01:34:09.800]   Studio Neat made one of my favorite little devices
[01:34:09.800 --> 01:34:10.800]   for the iPhone.
[01:34:10.800 --> 01:34:12.560]   It was called the Glyph.
[01:34:12.560 --> 01:34:14.360]   And I loved it because it's just so clever.
[01:34:14.360 --> 01:34:19.240]   This is a tripod stand, a tripod mount, and like easel stand
[01:34:19.240 --> 01:34:23.560]   for iPhone 4, 4S, and 5, where you see the tripod mount.
[01:34:23.560 --> 01:34:27.160]   So you can either put in this little slot right here
[01:34:27.160 --> 01:34:30.480]   and use it as a tripod stand, or you could use this little grippy
[01:34:30.480 --> 01:34:33.760]   sort of thing to sort of grip it onto the side of the screen.
[01:34:33.760 --> 01:34:36.720]   And it would like stand up on the table like an easel.
[01:34:36.720 --> 01:34:38.360]   So now they came up with a new version of this
[01:34:38.360 --> 01:34:41.400]   because the only problem is really, really brilliant.
[01:34:41.400 --> 01:34:44.080]   The only problem is that it really is only for the iPhone 4,
[01:34:44.080 --> 01:34:46.240]   4S, and 5S.
[01:34:46.240 --> 01:34:50.080]   Now they came up with this new one, the new Glyph, which
[01:34:50.080 --> 01:34:52.400]   is much the same thing only.
[01:34:52.400 --> 01:34:54.320]   It is completely adjustable.
[01:34:54.320 --> 01:34:57.960]   So whatever phone you have now, whatever phone you're
[01:34:57.960 --> 01:34:59.480]   going to have in the next couple of years,
[01:34:59.480 --> 01:35:04.840]   you take a hex key that goes inside the tripod mount
[01:35:04.840 --> 01:35:09.760]   and you adjust the width of these jaws and the width of these jaws.
[01:35:09.760 --> 01:35:11.840]   And then once you've done that once and you
[01:35:11.840 --> 01:35:13.480]   don't have to have that hex key again,
[01:35:13.480 --> 01:35:16.640]   now you've made it the perfect size for not only
[01:35:16.640 --> 01:35:18.760]   whatever phone you have, but whatever case
[01:35:18.760 --> 01:35:20.280]   you like to keep it in.
[01:35:20.280 --> 01:35:23.160]   And even if you are an isolated iPhone 5 user,
[01:35:23.160 --> 01:35:26.240]   it means that you won't have to take your phone out of your case
[01:35:26.240 --> 01:35:27.440]   to use this.
[01:35:27.440 --> 01:35:29.840]   So you get both of those great features
[01:35:29.840 --> 01:35:31.680]   in which you have the tripod mount
[01:35:31.680 --> 01:35:34.240]   and you can also stick it into here
[01:35:34.240 --> 01:35:38.040]   and use it as an easel stand.
[01:35:38.040 --> 01:35:39.680]   And it's just really, really great.
[01:35:39.680 --> 01:35:42.800]   Again, you can lose the hex key after you've done with it
[01:35:42.800 --> 01:35:45.200]   because you only need to make that adjustment once.
[01:35:45.200 --> 01:35:48.000]   It also comes with this little adapter here
[01:35:48.000 --> 01:35:52.280]   so that if you want to wear it like a pendant,
[01:35:52.280 --> 01:35:54.560]   you could do that or hang it as a Christmas ornament
[01:35:54.560 --> 01:35:57.720]   or perhaps more practically, it screws into the tripod mount,
[01:35:57.720 --> 01:36:00.280]   attach a cord to this and stretch that down
[01:36:00.280 --> 01:36:02.600]   to your foot and step on it and stretch it.
[01:36:02.600 --> 01:36:04.120]   And you can actually use it as sort of a,
[01:36:04.120 --> 01:36:08.720]   as a little like very, very portable stabilizer or tripod
[01:36:08.720 --> 01:36:10.640]   because the tension of the string between your foot
[01:36:10.640 --> 01:36:13.400]   and this will actually hold the camera very, very steady.
[01:36:13.400 --> 01:36:16.440]   Again, whereas the first glyph got 10 points out of 10
[01:36:16.440 --> 01:36:19.640]   for clever, this is 9 point, a side of 9 for 10
[01:36:19.640 --> 01:36:23.000]   for clever, still in A and still not terribly expensive.
[01:36:23.000 --> 01:36:26.640]   It's 30 bucks, but very, very neat piece of kit
[01:36:26.640 --> 01:36:29.080]   and something that easily fits in any sort of bag.
[01:36:29.080 --> 01:36:32.760]   It's gonna be part of my gift guide this year
[01:36:32.760 --> 01:36:35.520]   'cause it's exactly the sort of thing I love to give
[01:36:35.520 --> 01:36:37.400]   as a gift where people may not,
[01:36:37.400 --> 01:36:39.920]   it's not available like at every Walmart
[01:36:39.920 --> 01:36:42.680]   and soon as you see one, say, wow, where did you get that?
[01:36:42.680 --> 01:36:44.480]   It's so cool.
[01:36:44.480 --> 01:36:46.000]   Maybe it's not cool, but okay, it's useful.
[01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:46.840]   It's useful now.
[01:36:47.840 --> 01:36:50.520]   And of course, someday we'll all have $300 or 3D printers
[01:36:50.520 --> 01:36:53.320]   and be able to print those just any time.
[01:36:53.320 --> 01:36:54.160]   I need them.
[01:36:54.160 --> 01:36:56.440]   I don't doubt it, but until that day,
[01:36:56.440 --> 01:37:00.640]   go get it and Amazon drones will deliver them for us.
[01:37:00.640 --> 01:37:01.480]   Exactly, even better.
[01:37:01.480 --> 01:37:02.840]   We won't have to carry these around.
[01:37:02.840 --> 01:37:05.080]   We'll just simply say, oh, I wish I brought a tripod mod.
[01:37:05.080 --> 01:37:06.640]   Oh, wait a minute, beep, beep, beep.
[01:37:06.640 --> 01:37:07.480]   (imitates horn)
[01:37:07.480 --> 01:37:08.560]   Can't we print our own drone?
[01:37:08.560 --> 01:37:11.160]   Hey, we didn't talk about that story,
[01:37:11.160 --> 01:37:13.920]   the 60 minute story with Jeff Bezos and the drones.
[01:37:13.920 --> 01:37:16.640]   He tells Charlie Rose, I'm gonna show you something.
[01:37:16.640 --> 01:37:18.880]   No one else has seen before,
[01:37:18.880 --> 01:37:22.760]   drones delivering packages within 30 minutes
[01:37:22.760 --> 01:37:25.400]   in major metropolitan areas.
[01:37:25.400 --> 01:37:27.160]   There is some question about whether the FAA
[01:37:27.160 --> 01:37:28.560]   would ever approve such a thing.
[01:37:28.560 --> 01:37:30.320]   And UPS said, we're doing that too, we're doing that too.
[01:37:30.320 --> 01:37:32.880]   It's autonomous, they're not guided.
[01:37:32.880 --> 01:37:36.040]   They have the address programmed in,
[01:37:36.040 --> 01:37:38.040]   they go, go drone, bring.
[01:37:38.040 --> 01:37:41.920]   You think that's just a bit of stagecraft
[01:37:41.920 --> 01:37:43.240]   on Jeff Bezos' part.
[01:37:43.240 --> 01:37:46.120]   Let's keep in mind that this is a guy
[01:37:46.120 --> 01:37:48.320]   who is building his own space fleet.
[01:37:48.320 --> 01:37:49.240]   That's not a joke.
[01:37:49.240 --> 01:37:52.360]   He has, he's invested heavily, heavily
[01:37:52.360 --> 01:37:54.320]   in private commercial space flight.
[01:37:54.320 --> 01:37:56.440]   So this is a guy who, and also this is a guy
[01:37:56.440 --> 01:38:00.040]   who sold the Kindle when there was no market for it,
[01:38:00.040 --> 01:38:02.160]   knowing that perhaps in four or five years from now,
[01:38:02.160 --> 01:38:03.800]   this is gonna be a worthy investment.
[01:38:03.800 --> 01:38:08.760]   So I don't think that it's not like the famous Microsoft
[01:38:08.760 --> 01:38:12.040]   CES keynote devices where, okay, they have the ability
[01:38:12.040 --> 01:38:14.520]   to manufacture two of these for demo purposes
[01:38:14.520 --> 01:38:16.240]   and we'll never see it again.
[01:38:16.240 --> 01:38:17.840]   I think that they are actively working on it.
[01:38:17.840 --> 01:38:19.320]   And it was certainly very, very opportune
[01:38:19.320 --> 01:38:24.080]   to use this real, very prime TV spot
[01:38:24.080 --> 01:38:25.440]   to show this really cool thing
[01:38:25.440 --> 01:38:28.200]   that everybody's gonna be talking about all day on Monday
[01:38:28.200 --> 01:38:30.240]   during a time when people are hopefully gonna be thinking
[01:38:30.240 --> 01:38:32.080]   about shopping on Amazon instead of,
[01:38:32.080 --> 01:38:33.440]   instead of in other places.
[01:38:33.440 --> 01:38:36.160]   But you're right, I mean, I think I stopped after
[01:38:36.160 --> 01:38:39.160]   coming up with a list of 15 ways in which
[01:38:39.160 --> 01:38:42.200]   this does not seem possible, but we'll see.
[01:38:42.200 --> 01:38:43.800]   - I like your tweet, Andy, when you said that,
[01:38:43.800 --> 01:38:45.040]   at least people could tear up their black,
[01:38:45.040 --> 01:38:47.600]   their cyber Monday jokes and write drone drugs all week.
[01:38:47.600 --> 01:38:49.080]   (laughing)
[01:38:49.080 --> 01:38:52.680]   - According to R. John Hansman in the MIT technology review,
[01:38:52.680 --> 01:38:55.240]   it's technically totally feasible.
[01:38:55.240 --> 01:38:57.240]   The key issues would be if the FAA allows
[01:38:57.240 --> 01:38:59.120]   this kind of operation, they should.
[01:38:59.120 --> 01:39:00.640]   And if the business case makes sense,
[01:39:00.640 --> 01:39:03.480]   there's a startup in Palo Alto called MatterNet,
[01:39:03.480 --> 01:39:05.360]   which tested drones as a way to deliver supplies
[01:39:05.360 --> 01:39:07.160]   to refugee camps in Haiti.
[01:39:07.160 --> 01:39:09.320]   Found it cost only 20 to 70 cents to deliver
[01:39:09.320 --> 01:39:11.560]   a two kilogram package 10 kilometers.
[01:39:11.560 --> 01:39:14.520]   That's the significant savings over trunk delivery.
[01:39:14.520 --> 01:39:15.960]   - I saw Jonathan White on Twitter ask about
[01:39:15.960 --> 01:39:17.280]   the battery life though, because if you have like
[01:39:17.280 --> 01:39:19.400]   a parrot drone or something, it lasts for a few minutes.
[01:39:19.400 --> 01:39:21.440]   And that's probably not enough to reach most.
[01:39:21.440 --> 01:39:22.920]   - Well, I think that that's what he addressed.
[01:39:22.920 --> 01:39:24.760]   He said, what is it, five kilometers?
[01:39:24.760 --> 01:39:25.600]   I can't remember what he said.
[01:39:25.600 --> 01:39:26.440]   - 10 mile range, I think.
[01:39:26.440 --> 01:39:27.280]   - 10 mile range.
[01:39:27.280 --> 01:39:28.280]   So that's probably has to do.
[01:39:28.280 --> 01:39:30.560]   They have to go deliver, come back.
[01:39:30.560 --> 01:39:32.320]   - And carry up and get charged.
[01:39:32.320 --> 01:39:33.720]   - Yeah, well, it might be disconnected,
[01:39:33.720 --> 01:39:36.680]   as I can't imagine what it is that people need
[01:39:36.680 --> 01:39:38.960]   within 30 minutes that desperately--
[01:39:38.960 --> 01:39:39.800]   - Pizza and--
[01:39:39.800 --> 01:39:40.640]   - That this infrastructure.
[01:39:40.640 --> 01:39:44.640]   - I made the joke clean urine for sports teams.
[01:39:44.640 --> 01:39:45.480]   - Clean urine.
[01:39:45.480 --> 01:39:49.320]   - Someone on Twitter, like sort of like beat me
[01:39:49.320 --> 01:39:50.640]   and saying condoms.
[01:39:50.640 --> 01:39:52.360]   Like, okay, now I understand--
[01:39:52.360 --> 01:39:55.520]   - But you know, this is one remaining disadvantage.
[01:39:55.520 --> 01:39:57.120]   Apple has over brick and mortar stores,
[01:39:57.120 --> 01:39:58.560]   which is you can go to a brick and mortar store
[01:39:58.560 --> 01:39:59.680]   and get it.
[01:39:59.680 --> 01:40:03.000]   And if Amazon can save you a trip to a brick and mortar store
[01:40:03.000 --> 01:40:06.760]   on anything and have it within 30 minutes,
[01:40:06.760 --> 01:40:09.200]   that's a kind of a, I think that's a reasonable thing
[01:40:09.200 --> 01:40:10.400]   to be working on. - Order drones
[01:40:10.400 --> 01:40:11.800]   and the world's gonna end.
[01:40:11.800 --> 01:40:12.960]   - I need two drones immediately.
[01:40:12.960 --> 01:40:14.560]   - I just hate to see the skies filled
[01:40:14.560 --> 01:40:15.800]   with autonomous drones.
[01:40:15.800 --> 01:40:17.040]   It seems dangerous. - Yeah.
[01:40:17.040 --> 01:40:18.360]   - Like Coruscant.
[01:40:18.360 --> 01:40:22.920]   - It's just this basic idea of having these machines
[01:40:22.920 --> 01:40:24.800]   going through the air where,
[01:40:24.800 --> 01:40:29.200]   I just don't see them solving the problem of
[01:40:29.200 --> 01:40:32.080]   what happens when there's something happening.
[01:40:32.080 --> 01:40:34.240]   What happens when there's someone has a beach umbrella
[01:40:34.240 --> 01:40:36.920]   up in the front yard that is not on Google Maps?
[01:40:36.920 --> 01:40:37.760]   - Exactly.
[01:40:37.760 --> 01:40:39.160]   - Well, the drones are smart.
[01:40:39.160 --> 01:40:41.760]   - They'll say that it's like autonomous vehicles.
[01:40:41.760 --> 01:40:42.760]   They'll go around. - And the drones
[01:40:42.760 --> 01:40:45.200]   read their Kindle on takeoff and landing, that's my answer.
[01:40:45.200 --> 01:40:48.000]   - So Andy's a glyph was a Kickstarter project.
[01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:51.120]   I've got something that was a Kickstarter project
[01:40:51.120 --> 01:40:52.760]   called the Mag Cozy.
[01:40:52.760 --> 01:40:55.040]   And we might've mentioned this before,
[01:40:55.040 --> 01:40:56.880]   'cause Jeff Needle said we needed them and we ordered them
[01:40:56.880 --> 01:40:58.160]   and we, they're great.
[01:40:58.160 --> 01:41:02.080]   This is something I think many people need.
[01:41:02.080 --> 01:41:05.520]   You can get them on Amazon for around $7.
[01:41:05.520 --> 01:41:10.520]   It's a little rubber or plastic dongle that hooks onto your,
[01:41:10.520 --> 01:41:13.520]   and we have a lot of these power adapter,
[01:41:13.520 --> 01:41:16.160]   the old school power adapter,
[01:41:16.160 --> 01:41:20.640]   and holds the new school adapter to go on it
[01:41:20.640 --> 01:41:23.560]   so that you can use your old school power plug,
[01:41:23.560 --> 01:41:25.720]   your old school MagSafe with your new MagSafe.
[01:41:25.720 --> 01:41:29.440]   Never again, these are expensive, these adapters.
[01:41:29.440 --> 01:41:30.680]   And I'm always afraid of losing 'em
[01:41:30.680 --> 01:41:32.160]   'cause they're teensy tiny.
[01:41:32.160 --> 01:41:34.160]   Now I'm looking, it looks like I've done this wrong.
[01:41:34.160 --> 01:41:36.080]   You're supposed to loop this through or something.
[01:41:36.080 --> 01:41:37.520]   But I think this is a great,
[01:41:37.520 --> 01:41:40.320]   I bought a bunch of 'em for the studio and I have 'em at home
[01:41:40.320 --> 01:41:42.080]   and I will vouch for the fact that they work,
[01:41:42.080 --> 01:41:46.600]   they do the job and you don't lose your MagSafe adapter.
[01:41:46.600 --> 01:41:48.440]   What is that called if it's an adapter adapter?
[01:41:48.440 --> 01:41:49.840]   - The MagSafe adapter adapter.
[01:41:49.840 --> 01:41:50.680]   - Okay.
[01:41:50.680 --> 01:41:51.520]   (laughs)
[01:41:51.520 --> 01:41:54.280]   And the Mag Cozy is 699, a successful Kickstarter
[01:41:54.280 --> 01:41:56.640]   that is now available on Amazon.
[01:41:56.640 --> 01:41:57.720]   That's the kind of thing you could have
[01:41:57.720 --> 01:42:00.480]   within 30 minutes from a drone.
[01:42:00.480 --> 01:42:02.880]   The Mag Cozy.
[01:42:02.880 --> 01:42:04.840]   We got 'em, they come in many colors.
[01:42:04.840 --> 01:42:07.040]   What do we, did I, I think I got red at home?
[01:42:07.040 --> 01:42:09.400]   'Cause it's more jazzy.
[01:42:09.400 --> 01:42:10.560]   - You're losing those things too.
[01:42:10.560 --> 01:42:11.400]   - Yeah, don't you?
[01:42:11.400 --> 01:42:12.240]   - Yeah, absolutely.
[01:42:12.240 --> 01:42:13.440]   - And it's the cost of losing one of 'em
[01:42:13.440 --> 01:42:15.680]   pays for 10 Mag Cozies.
[01:42:15.680 --> 01:42:17.200]   Renee Richie, your pick of the week.
[01:42:17.200 --> 01:42:18.720]   My pick of the week, I mentioned last week
[01:42:18.720 --> 01:42:20.480]   that we were doing a show on transcoding,
[01:42:20.480 --> 01:42:22.160]   a really geeky show on transcoding.
[01:42:22.160 --> 01:42:24.160]   So Don Melton, if you're not familiar with him,
[01:42:24.160 --> 01:42:27.320]   he's a guided Safari and WebKit for Apple, really smart guy.
[01:42:27.320 --> 01:42:30.680]   He's retired now and he's spending a lot of time on H.264.
[01:42:30.680 --> 01:42:32.720]   And as we all know, Blu-ray on the Mac
[01:42:32.720 --> 01:42:33.760]   is a bag of hurt.
[01:42:33.760 --> 01:42:35.440]   It is not supplied for you by Apple.
[01:42:35.440 --> 01:42:37.800]   You've gotta basically do it yourself.
[01:42:37.800 --> 01:42:39.780]   He starts off by saying that transcoding
[01:42:39.780 --> 01:42:41.600]   is not for everybody, it's not for most people.
[01:42:41.600 --> 01:42:43.680]   You can just buy your stuff on iTunes and enjoy.
[01:42:43.680 --> 01:42:45.080]   You don't have to worry about it.
[01:42:45.080 --> 01:42:46.520]   You shouldn't have to worry about it.
[01:42:46.520 --> 01:42:48.440]   But if you're the kind of person who watches Jaws
[01:42:48.440 --> 01:42:50.200]   or watches saving private Ryan
[01:42:50.200 --> 01:42:52.480]   and the murkiness of the video drives you out of your mind
[01:42:52.480 --> 01:42:53.680]   and you know that you could do better
[01:42:53.680 --> 01:42:55.200]   by not using default settings
[01:42:55.200 --> 01:42:56.400]   and by tweaking it yourself,
[01:42:56.400 --> 01:42:59.000]   he actually went through and he put together
[01:42:59.000 --> 01:43:01.440]   a list of really good tools to use on the Mac
[01:43:01.440 --> 01:43:02.360]   for transcoding.
[01:43:02.360 --> 01:43:06.520]   And he also wrote three scripts of his own.
[01:43:06.520 --> 01:43:10.000]   One that does transcoding, one that detects the crop
[01:43:10.000 --> 01:43:13.000]   because sometimes, like for example, the Dark Knight
[01:43:13.000 --> 01:43:16.640]   will change from regular resolution from 69 to iMacs
[01:43:16.640 --> 01:43:17.760]   halfway through the movie and back.
[01:43:17.760 --> 01:43:19.640]   So if you let automatic cropping,
[01:43:19.640 --> 01:43:21.240]   it'll just cut off all that content for you.
[01:43:21.240 --> 01:43:22.080]   - I think we're able to do that.
[01:43:22.080 --> 01:43:23.960]   - So he does that and he also has, if you wanna convert
[01:43:23.960 --> 01:43:26.560]   from MP4 to Matroska format,
[01:43:26.560 --> 01:43:28.040]   so there's a ton of stuff in there
[01:43:28.040 --> 01:43:30.480]   and he spends about two and a half hours explaining
[01:43:30.480 --> 01:43:33.480]   in incredibly nerdy detail all the pros and cons
[01:43:33.480 --> 01:43:36.360]   and he explains how Apple does the transcoding for iTunes
[01:43:36.360 --> 01:43:38.480]   or what kind of settings that they use for it
[01:43:38.480 --> 01:43:41.200]   or at least what he surmises that they use for it.
[01:43:41.200 --> 01:43:42.600]   - This is when you know a guy's retired
[01:43:42.600 --> 01:43:44.560]   when he spends a lot of energy
[01:43:44.560 --> 01:43:46.920]   figuring out and writing shell scripts.
[01:43:46.920 --> 01:43:48.400]   - He's pursuing his passion.
[01:43:48.400 --> 01:43:53.040]   And is he transcoding from Blu-ray?
[01:43:53.040 --> 01:43:53.880]   - Yes.
[01:43:53.880 --> 01:43:55.760]   - So every time a new version of X.264 comes out,
[01:43:55.760 --> 01:43:59.640]   he re-encodes his entire 200 plus disk Blu-ray collection.
[01:43:59.640 --> 01:44:01.360]   - Say that again.
[01:44:01.360 --> 01:44:06.320]   - Every time a new version of H.264 comes out,
[01:44:06.320 --> 01:44:07.680]   he re-encodes everything.
[01:44:07.680 --> 01:44:09.400]   - He starts re-transcoding everything again
[01:44:09.400 --> 01:44:11.000]   'cause he thinks he can do a better job.
[01:44:11.000 --> 01:44:11.880]   - Wow.
[01:44:11.880 --> 01:44:13.160]   - He's using handbrake mostly.
[01:44:13.160 --> 01:44:14.000]   - He's using handbrake.
[01:44:14.000 --> 01:44:15.900]   He uses a bunch of tools, but handbrake
[01:44:15.900 --> 01:44:17.000]   and the nightly builds he likes,
[01:44:17.000 --> 01:44:20.040]   especially when they do update the X.264.
[01:44:20.040 --> 01:44:22.000]   So this is high level Ninja Geekery,
[01:44:22.000 --> 01:44:23.000]   so it's not for everybody.
[01:44:23.000 --> 01:44:24.920]   But again, if you're using a Mac user
[01:44:24.920 --> 01:44:25.920]   and you wanna do this stuff.
[01:44:25.920 --> 01:44:28.000]   - What might call it slightly OCD?
[01:44:28.000 --> 01:44:28.840]   - Yes.
[01:44:28.840 --> 01:44:31.720]   - I'm just glad that he's using his massive retiree powers
[01:44:31.720 --> 01:44:32.880]   for good instead of evil.
[01:44:32.880 --> 01:44:33.720]   - That's true.
[01:44:33.720 --> 01:44:35.120]   - This is the sort of obsessiveness
[01:44:35.120 --> 01:44:38.160]   that turns some people to be measuring the length
[01:44:38.160 --> 01:44:40.200]   of everybody's grass in every yard
[01:44:40.200 --> 01:44:42.200]   to make sure they're within ordinances.
[01:44:42.200 --> 01:44:46.160]   - Or decides to buy up every patent
[01:44:46.160 --> 01:44:49.120]   that's available and start a patent troll operation.
[01:44:49.120 --> 01:44:50.240]   So yes, this is good.
[01:44:50.240 --> 01:44:52.960]   Start writing shell scripts in your retirement much better.
[01:44:52.960 --> 01:44:55.000]   - So if you wanna do your, if you wanna roll your own,
[01:44:55.000 --> 01:44:57.120]   and one of the reasons also is if you're traveling,
[01:44:57.120 --> 01:44:58.840]   if you use a standard iTunes download,
[01:44:58.840 --> 01:45:00.440]   it's 1.6 gigabytes.
[01:45:00.440 --> 01:45:02.320]   You can't put that many on a modern device,
[01:45:02.320 --> 01:45:05.000]   but you can shrink them down to 300 megabytes
[01:45:05.000 --> 01:45:06.760]   if you'd like to to make them portable.
[01:45:06.760 --> 01:45:08.000]   So there's a lot of really good stuff in there.
[01:45:08.000 --> 01:45:10.640]   - So you have to do that, get this from the show notes
[01:45:10.640 --> 01:45:14.160]   on imore.com because the links go to things
[01:45:14.160 --> 01:45:15.080]   like GitHub and stuff.
[01:45:15.080 --> 01:45:15.920]   So there's no--
[01:45:15.920 --> 01:45:16.920]   - It's on GitHub site.
[01:45:16.920 --> 01:45:19.200]   - Yeah, there's no central website in other words.
[01:45:19.200 --> 01:45:21.480]   But your show notes become the central website.
[01:45:21.480 --> 01:45:22.640]   - He will log it when he has time.
[01:45:22.640 --> 01:45:26.320]   - Vector22, Don Melton transcoding video.
[01:45:26.320 --> 01:45:28.400]   He's got the transcode video.sh,
[01:45:28.400 --> 01:45:33.400]   the detect crop.sh, the convert MP4 to Matroschf.sh.
[01:45:33.400 --> 01:45:35.320]   Handbrake.
[01:45:35.320 --> 01:45:36.320]   Oh, this is amazing.
[01:45:36.320 --> 01:45:37.480]   - And he's continually updating the scripts.
[01:45:37.480 --> 01:45:38.320]   Whenever you go to the link,
[01:45:38.320 --> 01:45:39.520]   you'll have the latest version of it.
[01:45:39.520 --> 01:45:40.640]   - Wow.
[01:45:40.640 --> 01:45:43.640]   - And he also points to X, BMC and Plex.
[01:45:43.640 --> 01:45:44.480]   - Yes.
[01:45:44.480 --> 01:45:46.000]   - Which would be two very good ways to play these.
[01:45:46.000 --> 01:45:47.920]   - Yeah, there's a segment on managing your media.
[01:45:47.920 --> 01:45:49.840]   His wife at one point started to play something
[01:45:49.840 --> 01:45:54.400]   and she saw, you know, BTFS-S10E1.
[01:45:54.400 --> 01:45:56.240]   And she said, "I have no idea what that means."
[01:45:56.240 --> 01:45:57.280]   - So I created a more...
[01:45:57.280 --> 01:45:58.600]   - Always a problem.
[01:45:58.600 --> 01:46:00.120]   - Point it out, it always throws you on your--
[01:46:00.120 --> 01:46:01.200]   - Yeah, an inter-
[01:46:01.200 --> 01:46:02.720]   - Final name system.
[01:46:02.720 --> 01:46:05.880]   Boy, I'm tempted now to just set up,
[01:46:05.880 --> 01:46:08.120]   first of all, I have to set up a lot of hardware.
[01:46:08.120 --> 01:46:09.000]   And how does he rip?
[01:46:09.000 --> 01:46:10.120]   He doesn't work on a Mac.
[01:46:10.120 --> 01:46:10.960]   - Yeah, he does.
[01:46:10.960 --> 01:46:13.240]   He has an external Blu-ray drive and it works.
[01:46:13.240 --> 01:46:16.120]   You mentioned some tools and it solves the copy protection issues.
[01:46:16.120 --> 01:46:18.400]   - I believe he covers all that sort of.
[01:46:18.400 --> 01:46:20.120]   In jurisdictions, where it applies to you?
[01:46:20.120 --> 01:46:23.040]   Like if your government taxes you for blank media anyway.
[01:46:23.040 --> 01:46:23.880]   - Right.
[01:46:23.880 --> 01:46:24.720]   As in Canada.
[01:46:24.720 --> 01:46:25.560]   - Yes.
[01:46:25.560 --> 01:46:27.440]   - No, he's, I believe in this.
[01:46:27.440 --> 01:46:29.320]   He's in California still.
[01:46:29.320 --> 01:46:32.120]   - Where we, in fact, we'll put some in jail for doing this.
[01:46:32.120 --> 01:46:34.480]   - And sometimes, for example, you might buy stuff on iTunes
[01:46:34.480 --> 01:46:36.360]   and then the company decides it's no longer available there.
[01:46:36.360 --> 01:46:38.040]   But if you have it on Blu-ray, you have it on Blu-ray.
[01:46:38.040 --> 01:46:40.080]   - These things happen. - Yeah.
[01:46:40.080 --> 01:46:41.200]   - Wow.
[01:46:41.200 --> 01:46:42.040]   All right.
[01:46:42.040 --> 01:46:43.960]   That's a good one.
[01:46:43.960 --> 01:46:45.880]   Thank you, Don, and thank you, Rene.
[01:46:45.880 --> 01:46:50.880]   And now finally to a Mac OS-Ken, Ken Ray, of MacOS-Ken.com.
[01:46:50.880 --> 01:46:52.720]   Do you have a pick for us, sir?
[01:46:52.720 --> 01:46:53.560]   - Yes.
[01:46:53.560 --> 01:46:55.480]   - Do you remember REX?
[01:46:55.480 --> 01:46:56.800]   - No.
[01:46:56.800 --> 01:46:57.640]   - Do you know him?
[01:46:57.640 --> 01:47:00.880]   He was, when he was 13, he was a big part of the jailbreak
[01:47:00.880 --> 01:47:01.880]   community.
[01:47:01.880 --> 01:47:05.920]   I actually interviewed him, gosh, six years ago now, I guess.
[01:47:05.920 --> 01:47:08.760]   He is older.
[01:47:08.760 --> 01:47:10.680]   - And wiser now.
[01:47:10.680 --> 01:47:11.520]   - Yes.
[01:47:11.520 --> 01:47:12.720]   - Yes, I think so.
[01:47:12.720 --> 01:47:15.400]   He came out with an app called Desk Connect,
[01:47:15.400 --> 01:47:17.800]   which was featured on the app store for a bit.
[01:47:17.800 --> 01:47:19.600]   - I actually love this app.
[01:47:19.600 --> 01:47:20.960]   - Oh, so you know it?
[01:47:20.960 --> 01:47:21.800]   - I think so, yeah.
[01:47:21.800 --> 01:47:24.400]   - For people who don't know it, it's basically just an
[01:47:24.400 --> 01:47:28.680]   incredibly easy way to share files between your iOS devices
[01:47:28.680 --> 01:47:29.680]   and your Mac.
[01:47:29.680 --> 01:47:30.920]   It just came out with an update.
[01:47:30.920 --> 01:47:33.000]   So now you can actually choose where it goes, because
[01:47:33.000 --> 01:47:35.520]   initially when you wrote it, if you had something that you
[01:47:35.520 --> 01:47:37.320]   were sending from one thing to another, it was just you
[01:47:37.320 --> 01:47:39.080]   drop it on the Desk Connect.
[01:47:39.080 --> 01:47:41.120]   And all of a sudden it would show up on all of your other
[01:47:41.120 --> 01:47:41.960]   devices.
[01:47:41.960 --> 01:47:44.600]   So if I was trying to send something to my phone on my Mac,
[01:47:44.600 --> 01:47:46.720]   it would go to my phone and it would go to my iPad, because
[01:47:46.720 --> 01:47:48.040]   I have it on both.
[01:47:48.040 --> 01:47:49.800]   And you know, same thing all around.
[01:47:49.800 --> 01:47:53.720]   The most recent update now lets you choose where you want it
[01:47:53.720 --> 01:47:54.400]   to go.
[01:47:54.400 --> 01:47:57.720]   Because he's a friend, I talked to him about it and I was
[01:47:57.720 --> 01:47:58.960]   kind of like, oh, well that's kind of neat.
[01:47:58.960 --> 01:48:02.360]   And then I almost immediately started using it at least
[01:48:02.360 --> 01:48:05.160]   two or three times a day.
[01:48:05.160 --> 01:48:08.600]   - This is in lieu of air drop.
[01:48:08.600 --> 01:48:11.000]   - Yes, in lieu of air drop and lieu of, I mean, what I was
[01:48:11.000 --> 01:48:11.840]   doing is emailing stuff.
[01:48:11.840 --> 01:48:13.040]   - Which I've never been able to get to work, by the way.
[01:48:13.040 --> 01:48:15.320]   - I was either emailing stuff to myself or sending stuff,
[01:48:15.320 --> 01:48:18.560]   you know, via message from one thing to another or waiting
[01:48:18.560 --> 01:48:20.960]   for photo stream to actually catch up with what I had, you
[01:48:20.960 --> 01:48:24.360]   know, photographed or snapped a picture of online.
[01:48:24.360 --> 01:48:26.720]   Because that's the kind of thing I'm using it for.
[01:48:26.720 --> 01:48:30.680]   Like for iChart, if there's a new app and I go and I download
[01:48:30.680 --> 01:48:32.680]   it and I want to show what the difference is, I just snap a
[01:48:32.680 --> 01:48:36.560]   picture of it and then drop it through a desk connect to my
[01:48:36.560 --> 01:48:37.520]   Mac now.
[01:48:37.520 --> 01:48:39.920]   And it doesn't seem like that would be that big a deal.
[01:48:39.920 --> 01:48:41.920]   It saved me maybe 30 seconds to a minute.
[01:48:41.920 --> 01:48:44.480]   But if you're doing that four or five times while it's
[01:48:44.480 --> 01:48:47.040]   trying to put something together, then it's saving you
[01:48:47.040 --> 01:48:48.640]   like five minutes and that's kind of awesome.
[01:48:48.640 --> 01:48:50.920]   I just like the control of it.
[01:48:50.920 --> 01:48:53.520]   I will say there's one thing that kind of freaks people out.
[01:48:53.520 --> 01:48:57.720]   The stuff does live on his servers for 30 days.
[01:48:57.720 --> 01:49:00.520]   I've known Ari for a long time.
[01:49:00.520 --> 01:49:03.160]   Personally, I trust him maybe one day he'll end up being
[01:49:03.160 --> 01:49:05.560]   an evil overlord genius and I will have been wrong about
[01:49:05.560 --> 01:49:07.400]   that, but okay.
[01:49:07.400 --> 01:49:09.960]   If that's something that concerns you, then it's not for
[01:49:09.960 --> 01:49:11.400]   sensitive information.
[01:49:11.400 --> 01:49:13.680]   If that's something that concerns you, but you know,
[01:49:13.680 --> 01:49:16.600]   I'm sending screenshots from my phone to my Mac.
[01:49:16.600 --> 01:49:18.520]   And so for me, it's absolutely fantastic.
[01:49:18.520 --> 01:49:19.920]   How incredibly,
[01:49:19.920 --> 01:49:21.920]   incredibly simply and easily that works.
[01:49:21.920 --> 01:49:22.840]   So that would be my pick.
[01:49:22.840 --> 01:49:26.880]   It's free, which is something else I asked him about.
[01:49:26.880 --> 01:49:29.120]   You know, it seems like something people would pay for,
[01:49:29.120 --> 01:49:31.520]   but he wasn't interested in getting paid for this.
[01:49:31.520 --> 01:49:34.960]   So I mean, it's out there and people can use it.
[01:49:34.960 --> 01:49:38.480]   And it's one of those things where if you hear that
[01:49:38.480 --> 01:49:41.680]   description or if you just try it, either it's going to be
[01:49:41.680 --> 01:49:43.680]   something that you're going to use and you're going to
[01:49:43.680 --> 01:49:45.560]   really be grateful for it or you're going to go,
[01:49:45.560 --> 01:49:48.000]   well, that's interesting and it won't be something you use.
[01:49:48.000 --> 01:49:51.480]   It's very much a, seems to me, it's very much a case
[01:49:51.480 --> 01:49:54.680]   specific thing, but if it's, if it is something that solves
[01:49:54.680 --> 01:49:57.280]   a problem for you, then it's just a fantastic problem solver.
[01:49:57.280 --> 01:49:59.520]   - So very cool. - Very cool.
[01:49:59.520 --> 01:50:00.960]   - Connect. - Disconnect.
[01:50:00.960 --> 01:50:03.000]   You picked that, I think at one point or?
[01:50:03.000 --> 01:50:04.400]   - Yeah. - Somebody mentioned it.
[01:50:04.400 --> 01:50:05.440]   - Yeah.
[01:50:05.440 --> 01:50:07.120]   Very good.
[01:50:07.120 --> 01:50:09.920]   Mac OS can go by his new iChart.
[01:50:09.920 --> 01:50:11.360]   It's on the App Store.
[01:50:11.360 --> 01:50:13.680]   I'm sorry, the news stand.
[01:50:13.680 --> 01:50:15.520]   - Which is kind of like the App Store.
[01:50:15.520 --> 01:50:19.200]   - It's a special segregated ghetto of the App Store.
[01:50:19.200 --> 01:50:20.200]   It's in there. - It's an affluent
[01:50:20.200 --> 01:50:21.040]   gated community of the App Store.
[01:50:21.040 --> 01:50:23.040]   - It's a gated, pardon me. - It's where the cool people are.
[01:50:23.040 --> 01:50:23.960]   You probably haven't heard.
[01:50:23.960 --> 01:50:25.480]   - Where are the cool people? - Hang.
[01:50:25.480 --> 01:50:27.880]   - And if you heard of it, they probably won't even let you
[01:50:27.880 --> 01:50:29.560]   in because they're really selective about it.
[01:50:29.560 --> 01:50:31.000]   - Jen Delmerman still loves the news stand.
[01:50:31.000 --> 01:50:32.680]   He's got his app there too.
[01:50:32.680 --> 01:50:34.600]   - Yeah, absolutely.
[01:50:34.600 --> 01:50:38.240]   You can also catch Ken's daily Mac news breaks at
[01:50:38.240 --> 01:50:40.360]   MacOSKen.com.
[01:50:40.360 --> 01:50:41.640]   Thanks Ken, great to see you again.
[01:50:41.640 --> 01:50:43.200]   Congratulations.
[01:50:43.200 --> 01:50:44.560]   - Thank you very much. - It's wonderful.
[01:50:44.560 --> 01:50:45.400]   - Thank you. - Thank you.
[01:50:45.400 --> 01:50:46.240]   - It's wonderful.
[01:50:46.240 --> 01:50:49.240]   How does your wife feel about your geeky habit?
[01:50:49.240 --> 01:50:50.440]   - Which one?
[01:50:50.440 --> 01:50:51.760]   - Which wife?
[01:50:51.760 --> 01:50:54.160]   - No, which habit? - No, which geeky habit
[01:50:54.160 --> 01:50:55.600]   'cause my goodness there are several.
[01:50:55.600 --> 01:50:57.520]   There's this country thing. - There's the Mac thing.
[01:50:57.520 --> 01:50:58.520]   There's the news stand thing.
[01:50:58.520 --> 01:51:00.240]   It's just, you know, it's ridiculous.
[01:51:00.240 --> 01:51:02.480]   - Some day, I plan to go back outside.
[01:51:02.480 --> 01:51:03.800]   I'm very excited about that.
[01:51:03.800 --> 01:51:05.880]   (laughing)
[01:51:05.880 --> 01:51:06.800]   - The sun is still there.
[01:51:06.800 --> 01:51:09.800]   - Renee, Richie had to actually leave town to get here.
[01:51:09.800 --> 01:51:10.760]   - It's like summer here, Leo.
[01:51:10.760 --> 01:51:13.600]   I left the snow in the freezing cold and it's...
[01:51:13.600 --> 01:51:15.240]   It's 48 degrees.
[01:51:15.240 --> 01:51:16.080]   - Balmy.
[01:51:16.080 --> 01:51:17.560]   - Balmy if you're in beautiful Petaloma.
[01:51:17.560 --> 01:51:18.960]   - In Fahrenheit.
[01:51:18.960 --> 01:51:21.440]   - Yeah, I don't know what it is in Celsius.
[01:51:21.440 --> 01:51:22.960]   - And we just, I heard just before the show,
[01:51:22.960 --> 01:51:24.640]   we launched Bitcoin on our store today.
[01:51:24.640 --> 01:51:27.960]   So if you decide you wanna buy stuff for your iPhone
[01:51:27.960 --> 01:51:30.120]   or Blackberry, we're Android device using Bitcoins.
[01:51:30.120 --> 01:51:32.360]   As of today, all the mobile nation stores accept Bitcoins.
[01:51:32.360 --> 01:51:34.800]   - That's a risky proposition for both sides.
[01:51:34.800 --> 01:51:37.360]   - I think they just, like, as avant garde technology
[01:51:37.360 --> 01:51:39.920]   and wear a bunch of geeks and they wanna see if they can do it.
[01:51:39.920 --> 01:51:40.760]   - No, that's cool.
[01:51:40.760 --> 01:51:42.560]   - But because it's so volatile, you never know really.
[01:51:42.560 --> 01:51:44.440]   It's like, I have no idea how they're gonna do it,
[01:51:44.440 --> 01:51:46.040]   but you're doing it.
[01:51:46.040 --> 01:51:47.560]   - But smart people, you give smart people
[01:51:47.560 --> 01:51:49.640]   a difficult job to do Leo and it makes it happy.
[01:51:49.640 --> 01:51:50.720]   - They like it, they like it.
[01:51:50.720 --> 01:51:52.600]   They actually embrace it.
[01:51:52.600 --> 01:51:54.080]   Thanks also, of course to Andy and Akko,
[01:51:54.080 --> 01:51:56.080]   as always from the Chicago Sun Times.
[01:51:56.080 --> 01:51:57.840]   Really great to have you, Andy.
[01:51:57.840 --> 01:51:59.800]   - I'll point out that the Chicago Sun Times
[01:51:59.800 --> 01:52:03.360]   is an American newspaper, so we are accepting canned goods,
[01:52:03.360 --> 01:52:05.000]   usually in good condition.
[01:52:05.000 --> 01:52:09.760]   My editor's assistant could use a sofa for her loft.
[01:52:09.760 --> 01:52:12.760]   So if you are a good sofa, then, you know, but no.
[01:52:12.760 --> 01:52:13.760]   - No, no, we're not.
[01:52:13.760 --> 01:52:15.120]   (laughing)
[01:52:15.120 --> 01:52:16.680]   Don't worry about this.
[01:52:16.680 --> 01:52:17.520]   - Thank you, sir.
[01:52:17.520 --> 01:52:18.680]   Thank you all for being here.
[01:52:18.680 --> 01:52:21.960]   We do Mac Break Weekly, 11 a.m. Pacific, 2 p.m. Eastern time,
[01:52:21.960 --> 01:52:24.280]   18, I'm sorry, 19 out of UTC,
[01:52:24.280 --> 01:52:28.560]   every Tuesday, right here on the Twig Network.
[01:52:28.560 --> 01:52:31.240]   And this show is not gonna move.
[01:52:31.240 --> 01:52:33.000]   Starting in January, some of our shows are moving,
[01:52:33.000 --> 01:52:35.320]   but Mac Break Weekly will stay right where it is,
[01:52:35.320 --> 01:52:37.440]   mostly 'cause that way we know we'll miss
[01:52:37.440 --> 01:52:39.320]   any major Apple announcements by just a few minutes.
[01:52:39.320 --> 01:52:41.040]   (laughing)
[01:52:41.040 --> 01:52:42.800]   - And let's Apple be certain of their schedule.
[01:52:42.800 --> 01:52:43.640]   - It helps Apple.
[01:52:43.640 --> 01:52:44.480]   That's why we do it.
[01:52:44.480 --> 01:52:46.200]   It's that way Apple doesn't have to move
[01:52:46.200 --> 01:52:48.000]   the press announcements around,
[01:52:48.000 --> 01:52:50.840]   and they can just do it at two in the afternoon,
[01:52:50.840 --> 01:52:52.800]   Pacific time on Tuesday, just like the other--
[01:52:52.800 --> 01:52:54.320]   - No, this dance is just gonna continue
[01:52:54.320 --> 01:52:56.040]   and continue until suddenly they're just,
[01:52:56.040 --> 01:52:58.440]   they're just, the Apple in this show is just gonna
[01:52:58.440 --> 01:53:00.160]   why don't realize they love each other
[01:53:00.160 --> 01:53:01.000]   and start that relationship.
[01:53:01.000 --> 01:53:01.840]   - I think that's, well, we'll hug it up.
[01:53:01.840 --> 01:53:03.040]   - Exactly what's gonna happen.
[01:53:03.040 --> 01:53:06.400]   We're getting married, and we're moving in together.
[01:53:06.400 --> 01:53:07.560]   Me and Apple. - Me and Apple.
[01:53:07.560 --> 01:53:08.920]   - One of those loud, shoddy arguments
[01:53:08.920 --> 01:53:10.840]   that suddenly ends on everybody kissing.
[01:53:10.840 --> 01:53:11.960]   - Just hug it out, Andy.
[01:53:11.960 --> 01:53:14.840]   - There's this fine line between love and hate.
[01:53:14.840 --> 01:53:16.760]   As I've learned many times,
[01:53:16.760 --> 01:53:18.160]   thank you all for joining us.
[01:53:18.160 --> 01:53:20.040]   - And Leo still won't be invited to the wedding.
[01:53:20.040 --> 01:53:21.800]   - No, is that ironic?
[01:53:21.800 --> 01:53:26.000]   If you want to watch live, do, but if you can't,
[01:53:26.000 --> 01:53:28.240]   you, of course, can always get on-demand audio and video
[01:53:28.240 --> 01:53:30.280]   after the fact, wherever a finer net cast
[01:53:30.280 --> 01:53:33.440]   or aggregated or here at twit.tv/mbw.
[01:53:33.440 --> 01:53:35.040]   If you'd like to be in our live studio audience,
[01:53:35.040 --> 01:53:39.080]   thank you, sir, live studio audience of one.
[01:53:39.080 --> 01:53:41.960]   You can just email tickets at twit.tv.
[01:53:41.960 --> 01:53:44.160]   We'll set an extra comfy chair out for you.
[01:53:44.160 --> 01:53:46.800]   Thanks for being here.
[01:53:46.800 --> 01:53:48.360]   Now get back to work, 'cause you know what?
[01:53:48.360 --> 01:53:49.560]   - Break time's over.
[01:53:49.560 --> 01:53:52.140]   (upbeat music)
[01:53:52.140 --> 01:53:54.720]   (upbeat music)
[01:53:54.720 --> 01:53:57.300]   (upbeat music)
[01:53:57.300 --> 01:53:59.880]   (upbeat music)
