[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.280]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly, the show we talk about absolutely nothing.
[00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:10.080]   Jason Snell is here, Andy Enoco. Alex Lindsey, we're kind of in that dead period with not a lot
[00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:16.720]   of new Mac news, but breaking news, breaking story, the home pods, the new ones, still leave a ring
[00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:22.080]   on your furniture, that and a whole lot more. We're actually gonna have a lot of fun. Next on Mac Break Week.

[00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:31.520]   news from Apple, of which there is precious little. But that's okay because we've got the best
[00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:38.560]   team of BS'ers in the business. Now who do I start with? Wait a minute.
[00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:47.520]   You see the wonderful Andy Inako, WGBH Boston. It's great to see Andrew and your Red Sox cap getting
[00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:55.360]   ready for pitchers and catchers to report. Yes, long as it keeps your knees and angles healthy.
[00:01:55.360 --> 00:02:06.400]   Golf is not that important in Florida. Good point. It's not been a few years between World Series
[00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:11.680]   Championships or like Penn and so we're kind of we got used to it, which is our fault, which is our fault,
[00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:15.600]   but we would like to see some performance. I love it after the World Series in October.
[00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:21.600]   You look at all these teams saying, "Oh, they're going fishing and hunting." They got
[00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:28.240]   so they got so February. This is why this is why sports casters make all the money. There's like
[00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:33.280]   I think the pirates were like paying like this dismal game and the commentator who I think was
[00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:38.560]   the local commentary was like, and that's September baseball for the Pittsburgh Pirates.
[00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:44.560]   That's it. It's over. Bye bye. Speaking of Pittsburgh, here he is, our own Pittsburgh native.
[00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:50.240]   Were you rooting for the Eagles on Sunday, Alex Lindsey? I have to admit, I wasn't really
[00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:56.000]   rooting for anybody. I have to be being here in San Francisco. I was rooting for the 49.
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:01.760]   Good. I was like, and I felt bad. It was hard. It was just that's probably one of the hardest
[00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:06.480]   games to watch that I've seen in a long time, where you make it all the way there and then you're
[00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:12.880]   just limping along. There's nothing you can do. It's like a... Don't tell anybody, but I was watching
[00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:18.000]   during Ask the Tech guys in Twitter. We had a big screen up to the right, and I might have been a
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:24.880]   little bit distracted at certain moments. Alex, of course, is officehours.global and 090.media,
[00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:33.120]   and with us also from sixcolors.com, the marvelous Jason Snell. Leo, when it's a slow news week,
[00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:37.920]   we can talk about puzzles we've done, tell anecdotes. How's your wordle?
[00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:44.400]   I was going to say there was a famously, because it went viral, a giant radio broadcast with John
[00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:50.400]   Miller and Dave Fleming, who are both spectacularly good radio broadcasters. It went viral because
[00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:56.560]   they were just discussing the rules of wordle for occurring in me. That's baseball in a nutshell.
[00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:02.640]   That's masterful. Just masterful stuff. It's like, "Dawg, do I guess all at once? No, John,
[00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:08.240]   you get two different colors. What do the colors mean, Dave?" Well, John, one means you have a letter,
[00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:11.520]   but it's not in the right place, and the other means you got it, and it is in the right place.
[00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:17.440]   Can I just keep guessing? Well, no, John, you only get five guesses, six guesses, six guesses.
[00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:24.000]   My daughter and I could discuss wordle in the evening. We're like, "How many do you do it in?"
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.680]   And she'll be like, "There was two days ago. She did six, and I hadn't done it yet." I was like,
[00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:31.200]   "Oh, I got to try it." I was like, "Six. Six." But my daughter took six. I was like,
[00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:35.120]   "It's going to be hard." Got five. But I was like, "Oh, that is hard. It's accomplished."
[00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:39.680]   Yeah, it was because I usually... I was mentioning, Lisa and I used to do it.
[00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:45.280]   Last thing before we went to sleep, we would cuddle up and do a wordle that those days are gone.
[00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:48.720]   She now does it first thing in the morning, and I always know because she'll come over. She'll
[00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:57.600]   slittle up to me and she'll say, "Two." She says, "Why don't you try?" She's a little competitive.
[00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:07.120]   Although we have a debate, and I think I'm right, of course. She will guess
[00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:14.320]   when she's got enough and there's like three possibilities, she'll guess the most common word,
[00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:21.280]   the most as if it were more likely. I think it's pretty random. I think any word that works is
[00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:26.080]   equally... They're going to be equally likely. Am I wrong? I find that they're usually the most
[00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:30.880]   common. They rub it in your nose. If you get to six, and when you get it, you're like... So they're
[00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:34.640]   doing a little... So they're doing a little... It feels like it's always relatively common.
[00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:39.120]   I don't feel like when I find most words, I don't find that I go, "Oh, that was really abstract."
[00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:43.520]   Well, they don't do abstract words. But for instance, a couple of days ago,
[00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:50.960]   the possibilities were flirt or shirt. I knew it was IRT. She might say, "Well, go with shirt.
[00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:56.720]   That's more common." So I don't know if there's that much. I don't know. Now, we see we're doing
[00:05:56.720 --> 00:06:02.480]   what Miller did. We're doing... I don't have to pay for the wordle. He's all about it.
[00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:07.600]   He do have to pay for the wordle bought. It's the fifth inning, and the score is three all,
[00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:10.080]   and there's really not as much to say. That's ball high, too.
[00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:15.440]   Two now. Pictures and catchers next month, right, Jason? I think I'm right on that.
[00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:20.320]   Yeah, I think it's almost next month now, right? This is the last day of January. So, yeah,
[00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:26.320]   we're almost in baseball. It's basically... Basically, it's over for our football.
[00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:29.760]   I'm in Pittsburgh. We have nothing to look forward to.
[00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:36.000]   Good hot dogs and a really good ballpark. That's what you get to look forward to.
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:41.760]   You know what? That's a cold beer on a summer afternoon with a good hot dog,
[00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:45.840]   and the game just kind of stretches out into eternity. That's baseball.
[00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:49.760]   Here's the secret. The dull war of the crowd is you nod off.
[00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:55.920]   I had a discussion with a basketball team. I was at the arena. We were working with the
[00:06:55.920 --> 00:07:01.040]   basketball team, NBA, and they don't win very often. No.
[00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:05.840]   It was packed. It's packed. People have a great time. I was like, "How do you do this?"
[00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:10.800]   He goes, "Well, the secret is that the bad teams are actually better to go to see because
[00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:16.960]   a team is consistently bad. Everything else has to work." So, they do all these other things
[00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:20.640]   to get the crowd excited. And he said, "If you want to see a winning team,
[00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:24.080]   even if they're going to crush your home team, that's the time to go see that winning team.
[00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:29.440]   You want to go see the Lakers or see the Heat or whatever is the one that is... I don't know
[00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:37.120]   any of basketball." But he said, "You see it there because they're firing t-shirts into the crowd."
[00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:45.360]   Like, the Pirates have a hot dog cannon, which they literally go down the side and they're
[00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:54.400]   "Joey snagged that hot dog like it." They're firing hot dogs into the crowd.
[00:07:56.400 --> 00:08:00.640]   They have all these. So, the teams don't win very much. They invest in a good stadium.
[00:08:00.640 --> 00:08:07.120]   PNC Park is probably one of the top five stadiums in... For sure.
[00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:12.960]   Around. And so, it's a great place to go and hang out. As you said, Leo, have a beer,
[00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:16.560]   have a hot dog, hang out with your family or friends. And what's the game?
[00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:22.160]   It's not terrible. You don't have to pay any attention to the eighth inning.
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:30.160]   So, our top story today, big, big news, the new HomePod, second generation, does in fact still
[00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:39.040]   leave white rings on wood furniture. Boy, I covered that one. I tell you what. I tell you what.
[00:08:39.040 --> 00:08:43.840]   It's big news day. Big news day when you... When that's the top story of the day.
[00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:48.000]   Have you got... Are you getting those, Jason, to review?
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:52.720]   I don't. I probably need to ask. I was not on the review program from that.
[00:08:52.720 --> 00:08:56.080]   I suspect if I asked, they might send me one. So, I should probably do that. Sounds like they
[00:08:56.080 --> 00:09:01.040]   sound good, though. I mean, the concern was that when they made them cheaper or reduced the number
[00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:06.880]   of tweeters and things that they were going to sound worse than the over-engineered first-generation,
[00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:09.840]   but it sounds like they don't. According to the reviewers, they sound pretty good.
[00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:16.960]   Two fewer tweeters, two fewer microphones, but they've added a humidity and temperature sensor.
[00:09:16.960 --> 00:09:22.640]   Well, there you go. Apparently, a better processor. We know it's a better processor because Siri
[00:09:22.640 --> 00:09:30.080]   is responding faster. Some people are saying it actually. It certainly has sounds no worse.
[00:09:30.080 --> 00:09:34.640]   Let's put it that way. Although, I like Marques Brownlee's two-word review,
[00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:39.120]   Apple HomePod 2 review. I'm confused.
[00:09:41.920 --> 00:09:47.760]   I guess his point is, what's the point? They canceled it because it was so expensive.
[00:09:47.760 --> 00:09:51.600]   Although, when they canceled it, it was the same price as they brought it back at $300.
[00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:58.160]   I ordered two because they're not going to give me a loaner and I wouldn't ask for one.
[00:09:58.160 --> 00:10:03.120]   So, I ordered two when we get it Valentine's Day, it's coming. I'll bring it in for
[00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:07.600]   ask the tech guys. We'll do a review of it as a stereo pair and all of that.
[00:10:08.560 --> 00:10:14.560]   Apparently, there is a better, there's an ambient microphone for sensing room ambience.
[00:10:14.560 --> 00:10:16.880]   So, it might be a little bit better. Alex, go ahead. Sorry.
[00:10:16.880 --> 00:10:21.200]   I'm excited. I'm going to, I bought so many Mac minis that I need to wait now to buy something
[00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:26.240]   else. But eventually, I'm going to buy these and I was kind of bummed because I had one and I
[00:10:26.240 --> 00:10:31.040]   didn't get the second one to try to do the stereo. But I really liked them. I got the little minis
[00:10:31.040 --> 00:10:35.280]   and I did not like them because they ended up in a somewhere. They're not great. I have it all
[00:10:35.280 --> 00:10:38.720]   over the house. They're not great and they're little. And I just was like, oh, I'd rather have
[00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:44.000]   the bigger ones. But then they weren't available. So, I think that I'm probably not the only person
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:50.160]   that might be getting that has one. I mean, ours literally runs six hours, eight hours a day
[00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:58.240]   of music or talk stuff or whatever. So, it's pretty, it's been really useful. I think that
[00:10:58.240 --> 00:11:01.840]   I decided I didn't really want Google and Amazon stuff in my house.
[00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:09.360]   So, I kind of decided I didn't need to be the product. And so, I kind of wanted to do something
[00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:14.320]   like that. I will admit that some of the, I'll be interested to see how it ties into material,
[00:11:14.320 --> 00:11:20.640]   and whether material actually works. I have a dream someday in the future that home kit or
[00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:28.720]   some kind of home thing will actually work. But I can be optimistic. Dream on. I know exactly.
[00:11:28.720 --> 00:11:38.080]   In the words of Vero Smith. Yes. I think that there's a level at which the speakers are good
[00:11:38.080 --> 00:11:43.200]   enough. There's a level at which the design of it is good enough as a physical object to have on
[00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:50.640]   the countertop. Apple really needs to address home kit and make Apple products. It's suck less
[00:11:50.640 --> 00:11:54.560]   as when it comes to home automation because they're not, they're not, they're not quite sucky,
[00:11:54.560 --> 00:11:59.680]   but they are, they can see sucky from here. They're like a nine iron away. They're just short of the
[00:11:59.680 --> 00:12:04.320]   bunker. One nine iron and they're boom, they're right on the green there. Really keeping us in the
[00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:10.960]   sports mode and the golf mode. Yeah, I appreciate that. Yeah. I feel like we're building a pyramid
[00:12:10.960 --> 00:12:15.920]   here. We're building a lightning foundation. There's some structure. I agree. Yeah. Yeah. I feel like
[00:12:17.120 --> 00:12:23.760]   they put too much of their money like a horse race. Huh? No, I don't know. On matter, right? Like
[00:12:23.760 --> 00:12:27.280]   matter, I feel like they're like, okay, matter is going to solve this and we're going to do a new
[00:12:27.280 --> 00:12:31.600]   home architecture and it's going to support matter and we're going to do that. And like matter
[00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:36.640]   keeps getting delayed. They tried to roll out the home architecture and it had to roll it back.
[00:12:36.640 --> 00:12:43.200]   Although now they may be rolling it out again soon. And like, I want, I don't want to give them
[00:12:44.400 --> 00:12:49.120]   full credit for this because I think the truth is that they have been so slow in the smart home
[00:12:49.120 --> 00:12:55.280]   market. But in the last year, it feels like they have made some decisions and they've started in a
[00:12:55.280 --> 00:13:01.840]   direction, but they have hung so much of it on this matter stuff that is just still not quite
[00:13:01.840 --> 00:13:06.720]   there. And I think it'll be this year is going to be really instructive, right? Because matter will
[00:13:06.720 --> 00:13:11.680]   start to come out and settle down in the next year. And does Apple, there are some reports that
[00:13:11.680 --> 00:13:16.080]   Apple has some other home products in the works that I would love to see that, right? Because that
[00:13:16.080 --> 00:13:20.880]   that is the question is they've been behind. I think maybe the last year they've been trying to
[00:13:20.880 --> 00:13:27.200]   catch up, but this matter thing has sort of been a bump in the road. So, you know, we'll see, but I
[00:13:27.200 --> 00:13:31.120]   certainly feels like the last year has been all about like, well, just wait until the matter comes
[00:13:31.120 --> 00:13:35.760]   out. And the matter thing has just been much more painful than anybody expected, I think.
[00:13:35.760 --> 00:13:40.480]   And I think that the Apple is really good at a lot of things and working with others is not one of
[00:13:40.480 --> 00:13:45.520]   them. And so I think that one of the issues is that to get this really off the ground, I really
[00:13:45.520 --> 00:13:48.880]   feel like, and I probably said this before, but I really think Apple should build five products.
[00:13:48.880 --> 00:13:54.240]   They should build a thermostat. They should build a camera, a light, an outlet, and a door log.
[00:13:54.240 --> 00:13:59.760]   And they just build them. Just call it a day. They build them. By the way, that's about 90% of
[00:13:59.760 --> 00:14:04.560]   the market, right? Are those five things? And you just say, we're building all of these because
[00:14:04.560 --> 00:14:09.120]   all the Apple users would immediately just start buying those to do that. And then HomeKit would
[00:14:09.120 --> 00:14:15.840]   be a thing because all the Apple, if Apple built those five things, Apple users, like really deep
[00:14:15.840 --> 00:14:19.680]   Apple users would buy those five things and wait for everybody to show up at HomeKit. Like,
[00:14:19.680 --> 00:14:25.120]   they would just be like, I'm not doing it. It would basically block everything else for an Apple user
[00:14:25.120 --> 00:14:29.280]   forever. Like, they would just simply go, well, I got this stuff. And I'm just going to wait for
[00:14:29.280 --> 00:14:33.280]   people to use HomeKit rather than trying, they would, all of us would stop. I mean, all of us
[00:14:33.280 --> 00:14:37.360]   that are really like hardcore, like Mac only would stop even looking at everybody else's stuff.
[00:14:37.360 --> 00:14:41.040]   It didn't say HomeKit and really be HomeKit. No one would even bother anymore.
[00:14:41.040 --> 00:14:44.880]   But that, I mean, that ship is sailed, Alex. HomeKit is over. HomeKit is matter. Matter is
[00:14:44.880 --> 00:14:49.280]   HomeKit. Everything in the future is going to be matter. But that doesn't stop Apple from making
[00:14:49.280 --> 00:14:53.600]   good. I agree with you that it doesn't stop Apple from getting into this area. In fact,
[00:14:53.600 --> 00:15:00.400]   it feels to me somebody just asked in our IRC about making Wi-Fi routers and Apple stopped doing
[00:15:00.400 --> 00:15:04.880]   that. And it was an era in the mid 2000s or 2010s, something weird happened at Apple where they're
[00:15:04.880 --> 00:15:09.840]   like, let's just stop making accessories. Let's stop making displays. Let's stop making Wi-Fi.
[00:15:09.840 --> 00:15:13.440]   We're just not going to bother. And in hindsight, I think it was a mistake, right?
[00:15:13.440 --> 00:15:18.480]   Like they let the Eros and Orbeez of the world kind of make the product that should have been the
[00:15:18.480 --> 00:15:24.640]   next generation airport product. And I agree, like a thermostat, some other small products,
[00:15:24.640 --> 00:15:30.400]   I think that there's an opportunities, a sound bar that is literally a HomePod and an Apple TV
[00:15:31.280 --> 00:15:36.240]   and a camera put together. They have all the tech, they have all the software. Like there's a bunch
[00:15:36.240 --> 00:15:44.160]   of products out there, a kitchen-ish sort of thing with a speaker and a display like the Echo Show
[00:15:44.160 --> 00:15:50.320]   or the Google Nest Home, right? Like there are some opportunities. They don't have to do them all,
[00:15:50.320 --> 00:15:55.040]   but they haven't done anything other than these speakers and the Apple TV. And it's weird. It's
[00:15:55.040 --> 00:16:00.560]   weird. Well, yeah, I mean, I would love to say, I don't think Apple could ever do that and really
[00:16:00.560 --> 00:16:06.160]   pull it off in a way that would make most even Apple freaks happy. Because the great thing about
[00:16:06.160 --> 00:16:12.400]   home automation, if there is a great thing about it, is the idea of being at Home Depot and choosing
[00:16:12.400 --> 00:16:17.040]   between like two different home heating systems and saying, Hey, well, hey, great, the controller
[00:16:17.040 --> 00:16:23.200]   for one of these actually built will actually work natively with A, B and C, which and I have A and B.
[00:16:23.200 --> 00:16:27.840]   If Apple were to be in the position where, Oh, well, we were hoping that you'd buy your home heating
[00:16:27.840 --> 00:16:32.240]   system at an Apple store. Like, no, I'm not going to do that. And when you and when you're in a
[00:16:32.240 --> 00:16:37.040]   situation where I really, it's a esoteric thing, but I really, I really want my curtains to be
[00:16:37.040 --> 00:16:42.640]   open and closed, like according to, according to workflows that I make and other things. And oh,
[00:16:42.640 --> 00:16:48.480]   well, we don't make one that actually works well with that. But hey, look at this light bulb we sell
[00:16:48.480 --> 00:16:53.760]   for $8 more than what you can buy almost any other bulb for. I don't think I think you'd have to be
[00:16:53.760 --> 00:16:59.200]   a real Apple zealot to say, I'm only going to, I'm satisfied with Apple saying, no, we refuse to,
[00:16:59.200 --> 00:17:04.480]   we refuse to build things based on standards to, we refuse to put ourselves out that way to make
[00:17:04.480 --> 00:17:09.840]   these easier and give the customers more choices. Although I do agree with the idea that it's always
[00:17:09.840 --> 00:17:15.600]   nice when there's something that Apple at least you can always tell when Apple, some engineers at
[00:17:15.600 --> 00:17:22.640]   this company, they got, they got like the two months like hotel room in Cupertino, and they were
[00:17:22.640 --> 00:17:27.280]   making regular trips into the spaceship campus. They got special access to make sure that their
[00:17:27.280 --> 00:17:32.720]   hardware worked extremely well. You always tell the ones that were blessed by Apple, even though
[00:17:32.720 --> 00:17:38.000]   they weren't made by Apple. So I always want to have that in the lineup. But the only thing that
[00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:42.640]   always disappoints me about Apple is that they're really great. They've proven they're really great
[00:17:42.640 --> 00:17:48.160]   when they control the entire widget, the entire flow from start to finish. They're not so great
[00:17:48.160 --> 00:17:52.080]   when it's like, yes, but what if I don't want to use Apple headphones? Can you make it work with that?
[00:17:52.080 --> 00:17:55.840]   So that's my reaction. And I think that the issue is, is that I just,
[00:17:55.840 --> 00:18:02.320]   I think it's part of this, this folds back into why I like Apple to just have the Apple store and
[00:18:02.320 --> 00:18:06.720]   everything else is because everybody else does dorky things. Like they just do, they just do,
[00:18:06.720 --> 00:18:13.040]   all these home automation is just dorky. It's all weird ways to pair it and weird ways to do all
[00:18:13.040 --> 00:18:17.600]   this other stuff. And you're just like, dudes, why don't you just fix this? And I'm used to just
[00:18:17.600 --> 00:18:21.760]   being able to, like with an Apple product, this goes here, oh, you want to trade Wi-Fi, you want to
[00:18:21.760 --> 00:18:25.520]   sign in, you want me to load all this stuff in, you want to make all this stuff go. And the thing is,
[00:18:25.520 --> 00:18:31.120]   is that an Apple has, I will argue, almost never succeeded. They always want to open up the market
[00:18:31.120 --> 00:18:35.600]   to third parties and they try not to get in the way by building their own products. Like,
[00:18:35.600 --> 00:18:40.800]   I think iBooks was a huge disaster because of this, because they didn't really push down and build
[00:18:40.800 --> 00:18:45.760]   real content that took advantage of what they could, what the platform could do. They just asked
[00:18:45.760 --> 00:18:50.400]   Pearson to do something and Pearson just put out stuff that comes out of the back of a horse.
[00:18:50.400 --> 00:18:57.360]   And so the issue is, is then you ended up with no imagination. I think Apple has to take that
[00:18:57.360 --> 00:19:01.840]   first step. And I don't think it's, I don't know, I've been trying to get home automation to work
[00:19:01.840 --> 00:19:09.120]   for 20 years and I'm now just waiting. I'm just waiting to like, like, I'm bristled and frustrated.
[00:19:09.120 --> 00:19:12.960]   And again, a lot of the things that are the promise of matter, right? The idea that you have
[00:19:12.960 --> 00:19:17.280]   these controllers that are running, that they can talk to one another, the promise of matter,
[00:19:17.280 --> 00:19:21.840]   the theory of matter, is it is HomeKit taken to the next level and anybody can buy in, right?
[00:19:21.840 --> 00:19:27.120]   It's not Apple specific. It is Google behind it and Amazon behind it. Like, everybody's behind it.
[00:19:27.120 --> 00:19:32.640]   The problem is it just hasn't happened yet, for whatever reason. Everything is slow to market.
[00:19:32.640 --> 00:19:37.280]   But like, the dream is that this is all going to get better because the underlying
[00:19:37.920 --> 00:19:43.200]   structure of matter is intended to solve a lot of the problems we've seen in this first generation
[00:19:43.200 --> 00:19:48.240]   of, of home standards. The problem is again, where is it? I would like to see it. And, and yeah,
[00:19:48.240 --> 00:19:52.320]   there are categories, I think where Apple could contribute not something that would box out other
[00:19:52.320 --> 00:19:57.200]   people by being incompatible because I think that that ship has sailed with matter. But by making a
[00:19:57.200 --> 00:20:02.720]   product that has some nice extra stuff in it that makes it worth spending more money because that is
[00:20:02.720 --> 00:20:07.680]   sort of the Apple deal. And would that be a Wi-Fi router or would that be a sound bar or something
[00:20:07.680 --> 00:20:12.000]   like that? I think those are places where they can add a little extra, charge a lot extra,
[00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:16.720]   and sell a lot to people who are drifting through an Apple store at their local shopping center.
[00:20:16.720 --> 00:20:22.080]   And that's the business model, right? Yeah. I would love to see the make a Wi-Fi router
[00:20:22.080 --> 00:20:28.720]   because that is so well placed for their, for how they describe themselves. The idea of not only
[00:20:28.720 --> 00:20:34.080]   having home networking that works really, really extremely well, that's just you plug it in and
[00:20:34.080 --> 00:20:39.840]   it goes as well as, as well as any networking device can be plug and play. On top of everything
[00:20:39.840 --> 00:20:47.600]   else, the power of a router to protect every computer inside that house from, from, from
[00:20:47.600 --> 00:20:52.320]   Adware, from, from, from, from ad tracking, from marketing, from everything. I have, I have a
[00:20:52.320 --> 00:20:57.760]   pie hole on my, on my network that simply says, Hey, look, here's, here's a list of, of constantly
[00:20:57.760 --> 00:21:04.720]   updated domain names for addresses for marketing companies that, that track your, track your,
[00:21:04.720 --> 00:21:09.360]   your behavior online. Just block every single thing that comes through that through those,
[00:21:09.360 --> 00:21:14.160]   those portals. It just simply never reaches any device inside the house. Imagine something like
[00:21:14.160 --> 00:21:20.080]   that only it's not really tricky to set up. It's not, it doesn't feel like a form of, of magic in
[00:21:20.080 --> 00:21:25.280]   order to do. It's just an Apple product and it's a switch that is on by default that you would only
[00:21:25.280 --> 00:21:28.960]   turn off if you find the one thing that doesn't work anymore. And then there's an easy way to
[00:21:28.960 --> 00:21:33.520]   make an exception for that. There's so, and that's, and that's only one thing you can do once,
[00:21:33.520 --> 00:21:40.240]   if you create like the, the golden router that solves so many, so many problems that, that pop
[00:21:40.240 --> 00:21:44.880]   up and then just absolutely kill your entire day. Apple's in a really good position to fix that.
[00:21:44.880 --> 00:21:49.760]   I'd love to see them do a router. Yeah, I've, I've wasted lots of pixels and lots of bites and lots
[00:21:49.760 --> 00:21:53.680]   of places writing columns about that Andy over the last few years. And I agree with you. I think
[00:21:53.680 --> 00:21:57.440]   it goes straight to Apple's desire to be seen as a privacy company, right?
[00:21:57.440 --> 00:22:04.000]   Say ease of use, put this in, in there. It would allow them to potentially do things like, if not
[00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:10.080]   straight up VPN to put private relaying and private relay and all of those things built in there and
[00:22:10.080 --> 00:22:14.640]   say, we, you can trust us. We're gonna, we're gonna protect you from all this stuff. And maybe,
[00:22:14.640 --> 00:22:20.400]   yes, maybe some pie hole style ad blocking as well. Like they can, they could really gum up the works
[00:22:20.400 --> 00:22:24.960]   in a delightful way if they wanted to. And although Euro and Orbeez sort of,
[00:22:24.960 --> 00:22:28.960]   obviously made the product that Apple would have made if they had made a product in 2016,
[00:22:28.960 --> 00:22:35.600]   2017, 2015, they didn't, but that's still out there. The idea that you can, you could put mesh
[00:22:35.600 --> 00:22:38.800]   networking in different Apple products as well to spread them throughout your house. Like,
[00:22:38.800 --> 00:22:42.160]   I still think there's probably an opportunity there for them to do something. I just wish they
[00:22:42.160 --> 00:22:46.640]   had thought of it five years ago. But I think Apple in 2015 was in a real weird place where they
[00:22:46.640 --> 00:22:52.480]   just decided they were not gonna bother with any ancillary products. And I think in the display,
[00:22:52.480 --> 00:22:56.560]   it's a great example where they had to say, okay, that was a mistake. And I think for Wi-Fi,
[00:22:56.560 --> 00:23:01.360]   I think it was a mistake too. Yeah. You think Apple's still influenced by Steve Jobs' magic
[00:23:01.360 --> 00:23:06.720]   quadrant when he came back to Apple, they had so many SKUs, and he just cut it down to home and
[00:23:06.720 --> 00:23:12.880]   business, portable and desktop. But that was for the magic, right? I mean, Jobs came out with the
[00:23:12.880 --> 00:23:18.560]   airport. I feel like he always said, you know, they're same no more often than you say yes.
[00:23:18.560 --> 00:23:25.600]   I feel like he had this kind of idea of purity. When I worked at McDonald's way back in the day,
[00:23:25.600 --> 00:23:30.240]   there were people who came in, I know, I know, this is good, right? We got time.
[00:23:30.240 --> 00:23:34.320]   Yeah. Tell us what I was like. What was on the menu, man?
[00:23:34.320 --> 00:23:39.200]   There were people who came in and said, why don't you do, you know, roast beef sandwich or,
[00:23:39.200 --> 00:23:44.320]   you know, they have all these ideas. And seriously, in that day, it's changed a little bit. But the
[00:23:44.320 --> 00:23:48.000]   idea was, no, no, you want a very small number of products that you can make well
[00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:52.800]   with minimal training and minimal equipment. But you get the menu too complicated,
[00:23:52.800 --> 00:23:57.600]   then you can't keep quality control. And I think that there's a reason for that.
[00:23:57.600 --> 00:24:03.840]   Why do you think, though, Apple doesn't do, I mean, a router and a sound bar all built around matter
[00:24:04.640 --> 00:24:10.080]   kind of makes sense. And then Alex's idea of, you know, an ephermistad, you know, the lock,
[00:24:10.080 --> 00:24:15.280]   the four big, you know, home automation products, that seems like that would be something Apple
[00:24:15.280 --> 00:24:20.320]   could do quite well. I think that originally, I think that really the idea is, as Apple knows,
[00:24:20.320 --> 00:24:24.560]   that once they go in and take away 80% of the market, 90% of the market, it's hard to get other
[00:24:24.560 --> 00:24:29.520]   people to congeal around them. So the idea is like, we can't build everything. So let's just
[00:24:29.520 --> 00:24:33.120]   build a platform that people can integrate because we don't want to necessarily get into
[00:24:33.120 --> 00:24:37.760]   this smaller business. We don't want to necessarily do this, but we want to make it available to our
[00:24:37.760 --> 00:24:42.160]   users, but we don't want to, but we don't want to take it over. And I will admit that if they took
[00:24:42.160 --> 00:24:46.960]   the five things that I listed, that's like 80, 90% of the home automation market, they would literally
[00:24:46.960 --> 00:24:52.320]   just, they would fill out that. And then the question is, can you attract, you'd have to be betting
[00:24:52.320 --> 00:24:56.160]   on the fact that a lot of people are going to buy into that. Because if not enough people buy
[00:24:56.160 --> 00:25:00.880]   into it, then that market's dead. Because, you know, it's, it's all, you know, closed and they,
[00:25:00.880 --> 00:25:04.960]   they're self-contained because they have most of what they need. So I think that Apple, you know,
[00:25:04.960 --> 00:25:08.560]   and they, I feel like the same thing they did with iBooks, same thing they've done a couple
[00:25:08.560 --> 00:25:13.920]   other times where they try to go, we're going to nurture the market forward. But they didn't,
[00:25:13.920 --> 00:25:18.320]   either they didn't nurture it enough or they, you know, they, and that's the, you know, I think that
[00:25:18.320 --> 00:25:24.560]   I hope, I hope when we look at AR, for instance, that that Apple looks at what Epic's doing,
[00:25:24.560 --> 00:25:32.080]   which is the mega grants, and really leans into that. Because, you know, unity and, and unreal were
[00:25:32.080 --> 00:25:38.080]   equal. And then Epic said, Hey, we can spend $100 million, you know, at a time, not even a guarantee
[00:25:38.080 --> 00:25:43.840]   is only 100 million, but 100 million at a time to, you know, engage people to build something. I
[00:25:43.840 --> 00:25:46.640]   don't think Apple really did that. They don't want to pay to other people to develop for them. And
[00:25:46.640 --> 00:25:50.960]   that becomes problematic. Yeah. I think, I think it's a combination of things. I think that what Leo
[00:25:50.960 --> 00:25:56.160]   said has some, has some influence on Apple culture, where they do like to have a streamlined,
[00:25:56.160 --> 00:26:02.640]   a streamlined product line. I think that it becomes problematic when you start to compete with,
[00:26:02.640 --> 00:26:08.080]   when you create a router, it's really going to be difficult to educate people on. Here's why our
[00:26:08.080 --> 00:26:13.680]   $200 router is better than the $90 router. You can get it home depot, or you can get it
[00:26:13.680 --> 00:26:18.640]   best buy our new play cells. That's hard. That's hard to, you have to, there is not that there is
[00:26:18.640 --> 00:26:22.080]   no differences between them, but you have to really make sure you communicate those really,
[00:26:22.080 --> 00:26:28.640]   really clearly. But more than that, I think that actually this hits back on the HomePod.
[00:26:28.640 --> 00:26:35.760]   Apple famously, they have a very, very limited amount of bandwidth, like for focus on products.
[00:26:35.760 --> 00:26:41.360]   They don't, I think one of the reasons why the HomePod didn't, was canceled and had to be revived
[00:26:41.360 --> 00:26:46.320]   is because it just had to be back burnered for some for time after time after time cycle after
[00:26:46.320 --> 00:26:51.520]   cycle. It could not get the love and the, and the iteration that it would have gotten had Apple
[00:26:51.520 --> 00:26:55.760]   had the principal love. Nope, guess what? Congratulations. You get your own building on the campus.
[00:26:55.760 --> 00:27:00.000]   You are the HomePod unit. Make the best one you can. Here's the budget for it. Just keep coming
[00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:05.600]   back at us. I think that part of the problem is that they just don't have for good or bad.
[00:27:05.600 --> 00:27:10.080]   And I think right now we're seeing the good of it that they don't have, they're not bringing in
[00:27:10.080 --> 00:27:15.040]   all these teams. They have to then lay off in a, in a bed, you can all downturn, but they don't
[00:27:15.040 --> 00:27:20.000]   have the amount of bandwidth to vote to create that many different product lines and give them all
[00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:24.240]   the love that they would need in order to thrive and survive. Somebody in the chat room said,
[00:27:24.240 --> 00:27:28.160]   you know, the airport extreme was an audio device. We forget that. It had an audio.
[00:27:28.160 --> 00:27:32.160]   It wasn't an airplane, airplane out as well. I think, you know, I suspect that in that moment
[00:27:32.160 --> 00:27:36.240]   where they killed the airport, that what they were really saying is that they didn't have a vision
[00:27:36.240 --> 00:27:41.600]   for like why that, that category needed anything because it was a commoditized product and a lot
[00:27:41.600 --> 00:27:45.600]   of cable modems where they all had Wi-Fi then and it's like, well, why wouldn't you use that?
[00:27:45.600 --> 00:27:49.840]   And it's funny because about, you know, a few years later, it became clear, I think,
[00:27:49.840 --> 00:27:54.240]   why you actually would want to make that product. And that's when Eero and Orbe came out because,
[00:27:54.240 --> 00:27:58.240]   you know, because you don't want to trust your cable companies routing. Their Wi-Fi is probably
[00:27:58.240 --> 00:28:04.320]   not good enough. The whole idea of a mesh network to extend your Wi-Fi and have it be better and
[00:28:04.320 --> 00:28:10.560]   faster. Like they missed the cycle because they were not wrong. In that moment, it really did feel like
[00:28:11.280 --> 00:28:16.240]   Wi-Fi was just a commodity and it was going to all be in your cable router and who cared.
[00:28:16.240 --> 00:28:24.160]   And that was right at the time, but wrong soon thereafter. And it's just kind of a funny thing.
[00:28:24.160 --> 00:28:28.000]   I think they were looking for projects. As Andy said, projects to throw overboard,
[00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:33.120]   to say with some discipline, right? Like, we don't need to make this product just because we made it
[00:28:33.120 --> 00:28:37.040]   in the past. The world has got this thing down to a science. We don't need to be here because the
[00:28:37.040 --> 00:28:42.080]   reason they made AirPort in the first place was that they had Wi-Fi before most other
[00:28:42.080 --> 00:28:48.640]   companies did. And they wanted a first-class Wi-Fi solution, right? But that time it passed.
[00:28:48.640 --> 00:28:52.400]   So that's what I got out of it, unfortunately. They wanted their customers to have a really good
[00:28:52.400 --> 00:28:58.480]   experience when there are very few router's Wi-Fi routers available back when every single adopted.
[00:28:58.480 --> 00:29:05.840]   Yeah. I wonder, I really do wonder why they're not listening to us. This reminds me of
[00:29:06.800 --> 00:29:13.280]   and I always skip by these on Reddit in the Mac subreddit and the iOS subreddit. There's always
[00:29:13.280 --> 00:29:19.280]   people who have my new design for how the system preference pane should look. And I just,
[00:29:19.280 --> 00:29:24.160]   I skip by it. It's like, "Dream on, dude. Nobody, nobody at Apple is checking Reddit to see what
[00:29:24.160 --> 00:29:32.720]   your design for the next MacBook Pro should be. It's a fantasy." I don't think Apple's listening
[00:29:32.720 --> 00:29:38.960]   to Mac break with new product ideas. I think they do listen, but they listen to criticism of what
[00:29:38.960 --> 00:29:43.600]   they're doing. They don't take requests, right? That's not what they're doing. They don't say,
[00:29:43.600 --> 00:29:47.840]   so they're going to listen. If you say, "You know what? I think the new system settings app on the
[00:29:47.840 --> 00:29:52.960]   Mac sucks and here are my many reasons." They are listening to that. They absolutely are listening
[00:29:52.960 --> 00:29:59.280]   to that. What they are less interested in is your redesign of the system settings app. They have
[00:29:59.280 --> 00:30:04.960]   people whose job it is to train you. It's a classic design thing. This was when I was the
[00:30:04.960 --> 00:30:09.920]   editor at Macworld, I had an art director and I wouldn't tell him how to design the cover. I'd
[00:30:09.920 --> 00:30:14.720]   give him input about here are the things that would be good and here are the things that would be bad.
[00:30:14.720 --> 00:30:20.800]   Now you, as a professional, take all that in and don't give me, if I say make the font big,
[00:30:20.800 --> 00:30:25.680]   take away from that that I want it to be prominent. But don't take the details because I don't know
[00:30:25.680 --> 00:30:30.640]   the details. You're the professional. That's the level at which Apple does listen to
[00:30:30.640 --> 00:30:37.520]   generally, maybe not us in particular, but us as the world outside of Apple, is about the details
[00:30:37.520 --> 00:30:42.480]   of what people are complaining about, not how to solve them. That's not what they're looking for.
[00:30:42.480 --> 00:30:46.480]   Like your designer, Apple has all sorts of constraints that we're not aware of from
[00:30:46.480 --> 00:30:50.320]   manufacturing to design, to cost. I mean, there's all sorts of things.
[00:30:50.320 --> 00:30:56.240]   Color doesn't apply, Shane. Yeah, right. Yeah, exactly. Sorry, but the printers can't do magenta,
[00:30:56.240 --> 00:31:03.040]   but thanks for the suggestion. See you. It reminds me of my days when I was a DJ in radio.
[00:31:03.040 --> 00:31:11.520]   Every radio station says, "Call us with your requests." And it's the worst nightmare for a DJ.
[00:31:11.520 --> 00:31:18.320]   Some of the stations I had to answer, you'd be answering the phone during your show. There'd
[00:31:18.320 --> 00:31:21.680]   be phone lines. You were supposed to record them. You remember this, Alex? You were supposed to
[00:31:21.680 --> 00:31:25.760]   record them. Card them up. Card them up. And then you say, "Hey, it's John from Fresno. I'd
[00:31:25.760 --> 00:31:31.040]   really like to hear, you know, "Don't be brothers, but we don't stop believing." But the problem is
[00:31:31.040 --> 00:31:35.120]   that the people at home don't know. But you can't do brothers, but okay. What did I say?
[00:31:35.120 --> 00:31:40.560]   That's Journey. Journey. Don't stop believing. Yeah. What's the Michael McDonald one?
[00:31:40.560 --> 00:31:46.800]   Stop believing. Anyway, it's a... Anyway, that's the point. You might ask for the doobie brothers.
[00:31:46.800 --> 00:31:50.800]   Two, two, three. Don't stop believing. But I can't play it. And there's also...
[00:31:50.800 --> 00:31:56.880]   You assume they are. There's also a playlist that I am following. There's no room for requests
[00:31:56.880 --> 00:32:00.800]   on the playlist. I suggest you request something that's on the top 40. I just ask for something I
[00:32:00.800 --> 00:32:05.920]   have in front of me then. But that's why you record them and you play them back to pretend
[00:32:05.920 --> 00:32:10.320]   you're taking the first. Well, you play the song that was already in the rotation. You know, like,
[00:32:10.320 --> 00:32:15.280]   right. You just look at like, "Oh, uh, find one that pops in there." You know, soon with AI,
[00:32:15.280 --> 00:32:18.960]   though, you will be able to say, "I'd like the doobie brothers singing. Don't stop believing."
[00:32:18.960 --> 00:32:23.680]   You can't. Now, Brian, you know... Did you send me... It was you who sent me Ariana Grande singing
[00:32:23.680 --> 00:32:28.560]   a Billie Eilish song. Yeah, yeah, exactly. So soon you won't have to wait. You can
[00:32:28.560 --> 00:32:35.920]   mismatch all of those things and you'll just get a song. Okay. Don't stop believing. Keep forgetting.
[00:32:35.920 --> 00:32:37.920]   No.
[00:32:39.120 --> 00:32:44.960]   You don't know me, but I'm your brother.
[00:32:44.960 --> 00:32:49.120]   That's the right way. Is it my... Am I doing a little listen bad thing? Wasn't there a Doobie
[00:32:49.120 --> 00:32:54.240]   Brothers song about believing? Am I wrong? I must be wrong. I'm sure on the doobie, you believe a lot
[00:32:54.240 --> 00:33:02.720]   of things, man. What a full beliefs. Was that it? I think it was a full beliefs. What a full
[00:33:02.720 --> 00:33:07.040]   beliefs. That's what I... Oh, thank you for making me not such an idiot. So don't... So that
[00:33:07.040 --> 00:33:11.040]   said the song would be don't stop believing. Stop believing. Stop believing.
[00:33:11.040 --> 00:33:17.920]   Anyway, the wordle, it's five letters long.
[00:33:17.920 --> 00:33:22.560]   But what do the colors mean, Jason? What do the colors mean?
[00:33:22.560 --> 00:33:25.280]   Yeah, see that? Well, you know, there are two colors.
[00:33:25.280 --> 00:33:34.400]   There's no... The prime golden gilded, the aspirational example of this is on Channel 38, WSBK
[00:33:34.400 --> 00:33:38.720]   in Boston. Every Saturday, there used to be a show called Ask the Manager, where like the
[00:33:38.720 --> 00:33:44.080]   station management would be like at a table on the middle of whatever studio set was still standing.
[00:33:44.080 --> 00:33:48.560]   And they would simply like answer questions like send in by like viewers, normally about,
[00:33:48.560 --> 00:33:53.120]   "Hey, how come when you when you show the three stooges, you show it all shims last weekend?"
[00:33:53.120 --> 00:33:59.520]   And it was it was appointment television because I'm not sure they had any belief whatsoever that
[00:33:59.520 --> 00:34:05.200]   anybody was watching. I would tune in and for the first eight minutes, we would like to think,
[00:34:05.200 --> 00:34:10.480]   "Oh, and one and on." And they would be in the middle of a conversation about how to rotate
[00:34:10.480 --> 00:34:15.360]   tires because one of the managers was about to like take their tires in and so... But they're
[00:34:15.360 --> 00:34:19.920]   making diagrams and sharing with each other. Okay, so if I have a spare tire, is the spare tire
[00:34:19.920 --> 00:34:25.920]   number five? So it goes five, one, four, two, one? I swear to God, I did not make this up. This is
[00:34:25.920 --> 00:34:34.720]   what that show was and it was the best television. This is what mega mergers of TV station
[00:34:34.720 --> 00:34:40.320]   broadcast companies. This is what it's cost us. Ask the manager at Doey Middle-aged
[00:34:40.320 --> 00:34:46.160]   UHF television executives arguing with each other. That's called a podcast. That's just what the
[00:34:46.160 --> 00:34:53.600]   podcast is done. But if you looked at like what would I prefer to watch with the Super Bowls coming
[00:34:53.600 --> 00:34:56.880]   up and what would I prefer to watch the Manning brothers without any guests?
[00:34:56.880 --> 00:35:01.280]   They talked about this. Just geeking out talking about the Super Bowl and I would watch that in
[00:35:01.280 --> 00:35:06.640]   our art piece over top of over top. Just hanging out talking to each other, not no guests.
[00:35:06.640 --> 00:35:11.600]   Yeah. The ruins. It would be fun. So it just, yeah, the fluidness of it.
[00:35:11.600 --> 00:35:16.000]   Since we have fun... Who would we get to do that? Who should... That's a good podcast. Ask the manager.
[00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:18.880]   Who would the manager? Who would we get to do that?
[00:35:21.440 --> 00:35:27.920]   Who? Lisa, have Lisa do I ask the manager? Here's why we're never going to do your stupid podcast
[00:35:27.920 --> 00:35:32.720]   idea. That? Yeah. I don't know. Maybe that. Yeah. It's a college show where you take requests and
[00:35:32.720 --> 00:35:38.800]   then refuse them. And say why. You card them up. You card them up and then at the end you go, no.
[00:35:38.800 --> 00:35:44.640]   No. No. I'll tell you why. That song doesn't exist. You conflated a journey song and a do-we-brothers
[00:35:44.640 --> 00:35:48.640]   song into one song that doesn't exist and I can't play it. We're not even at AOR anymore.
[00:35:49.440 --> 00:35:53.760]   We can't play that song. That's out more in rock. We're modern rock now. We can't play
[00:35:53.760 --> 00:36:00.240]   journey. It's outside of our format. Billy, the intern broke that record. So we can't play it. Sorry.
[00:36:00.240 --> 00:36:05.680]   That's why we never play it. Speaking of this, Billy, you stepped on it. I signed up and I got
[00:36:05.680 --> 00:36:13.360]   invited to this voice AI place called 11 Labs that was very interesting. Yeah. And have you
[00:36:13.360 --> 00:36:18.640]   played with a little bit? They've actually had some problems. Because let me play back just
[00:36:18.640 --> 00:36:25.920]   to things. So you hear, oh, I guess I can't. Let's see. I don't know. Anyway, I'm signed up.
[00:36:25.920 --> 00:36:29.440]   But there was very good, but they had some problems because 4chan got a whole of it.
[00:36:29.440 --> 00:36:41.040]   And they've been using it to create deep fakes, frankly. Emma Watson reading mine comp, for instance.
[00:36:41.040 --> 00:36:48.160]   It's funny because Descript, the podcasting software, has had this for a while, but they make you
[00:36:48.160 --> 00:36:53.280]   be on a paid tier to get it. And the and what I have from Sunday.
[00:36:53.280 --> 00:36:59.040]   These guys gave it away for free. We did it with these script. Anthony Nielsen
[00:36:59.040 --> 00:37:05.200]   came in late last week and said, would you just read this? And I read something and I said,
[00:37:05.200 --> 00:37:09.680]   what is this? I said, my name is Leo Laport and I give full permission to use my voice. What are
[00:37:09.680 --> 00:37:14.800]   you doing, Anthony? And he used, was it a script or was it 11? I can't remember what he used, but he
[00:37:14.800 --> 00:37:21.520]   used one of those to create a deep fake Leo for our promo. Yeah, it's right at the very beginning.
[00:37:21.520 --> 00:37:25.440]   Do you have the promo there? Oh, wait a minute. You know what I have it in my email because I think
[00:37:25.440 --> 00:37:31.040]   Victor said, I put it in our disc. I put one in our discord if you want to play it. Oh, yeah. Let me
[00:37:31.040 --> 00:37:38.000]   verify that I, Leo Laport, like Descript to create an overdub version of my voice. Why do you want
[00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:48.880]   this Anthony? Well, hey, hey, it's a I, Leo Laport, the AI tech guy. This guy pronounced my own name
[00:37:48.880 --> 00:37:56.560]   better. Here's this is not Jason. Is that is that is this you? Yeah. And this was done by whom?
[00:37:56.560 --> 00:38:02.160]   This is 11 labs 11 looking beyond these particular trees to see the whole forest.
[00:38:02.160 --> 00:38:07.520]   The new MacBook Pro models are also the first. Oh my God. By high end versions of the M2.
[00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:12.640]   Apple's second generation. The only thing missing. There's a little bit in your
[00:38:12.640 --> 00:38:17.360]   prosody. That's the that's what they use. They apply prosody, which is your unique voice
[00:38:17.360 --> 00:38:22.880]   characteristics, your tamper and your pitch and your intonation to a synthesized voice and then
[00:38:22.880 --> 00:38:26.240]   get your voice. The only missing there's a little, there's a little thing you do,
[00:38:26.240 --> 00:38:32.800]   a little peak that's missing. So it sounds dead. They have a slider system on a chip.
[00:38:32.800 --> 00:38:38.560]   The laptop. See, when you said more or less, when you said they have a slider, see, I like that's
[00:38:38.560 --> 00:38:43.360]   what makes you lighter. It sounds like they have a slide to pro and what did you do to train it?
[00:38:43.360 --> 00:38:51.360]   And those different. I uploaded about 10 minutes of audio from my the upgrade podcast yesterday.
[00:38:51.360 --> 00:38:55.040]   So easy as they don't ask you to do. They don't ask you to say certain things.
[00:38:55.040 --> 00:38:59.760]   So you don't know. It's you just train it on existing content. And it's again, the slider is
[00:38:59.760 --> 00:39:04.960]   the fascinating part because at one end of the slider, it sounds like this and it's very monotone.
[00:39:04.960 --> 00:39:08.880]   And at the other end, it's crazy at the other end, it's like, and I'm on the radio.
[00:39:08.880 --> 00:39:14.560]   It's like this back to you, Jan. Right. And it seems you got to find the right place in the slider,
[00:39:14.560 --> 00:39:19.600]   where it's got some of that. But but it does. I I put it for my wife and she's like, it sounds
[00:39:19.600 --> 00:39:25.680]   like you like reading a like a script, but a little depressed. Yeah, a little depressed, like not
[00:39:25.680 --> 00:39:31.360]   quite. Yeah, but recognizably, I would say recognizably my voice. That's what I would say.
[00:39:31.360 --> 00:39:37.040]   And now here's a little segment from ask the manager on TV 38 in Boston.
[00:39:37.040 --> 00:39:47.680]   This isn't even set up. Wait, isn't set up like you're being
[00:39:47.680 --> 00:39:53.520]   on. Great. Thank you, man. I guess because we're going to be the manager of the game in the middle.
[00:39:54.480 --> 00:39:59.360]   All right. Yeah. I'm going to share this microphone. Oh, is that nice? Thank you, man.
[00:39:59.360 --> 00:40:06.160]   That's Dana Hersey. The movie love guy. The guy fell off his chair.
[00:40:06.160 --> 00:40:12.960]   There might have been two there. Could there be a cheesier set in your life?
[00:40:12.960 --> 00:40:20.240]   This is like a Saturday at Live Skit. Thank you for the discord for sending us that ask the manager.
[00:40:20.880 --> 00:40:27.120]   Dan falls off. Oh, you did it. Dan, of course. I'm sorry. I just looked at the name and not
[00:40:27.120 --> 00:40:36.240]   co. Oh, I got it. I got it. I not co. Oh, it's a link. Well, I have to say, I was interested in
[00:40:36.240 --> 00:40:39.920]   11 laps. You I mean, you could use that voice to read your articles. That's what you were doing.
[00:40:39.920 --> 00:40:44.800]   And I think that that's I think right. Like I actually had that moment where I thought this is
[00:40:44.800 --> 00:40:52.560]   good enough that if I wanted to for accessibility reasons, right, I could make MP3s of the days post
[00:40:52.560 --> 00:40:57.760]   at six colors and put it in a podcast feed, right? With Dan's voice and my voice, like I could totally
[00:40:57.760 --> 00:41:01.840]   do that. And it would be okay. Like it would be good enough for you to listen to it in the car or
[00:41:01.840 --> 00:41:07.600]   something, even if it wasn't like me narrating it, it would be good enough. And I know this is why
[00:41:07.600 --> 00:41:11.120]   DScript does it is you end up in an environment where you're like working on a radio show or a
[00:41:11.120 --> 00:41:16.320]   podcast or something. And the host is gone. And you need one line of bridging dials.
[00:41:16.320 --> 00:41:22.160]   Exactly. And so you generate it and drop it in and nobody knows the difference. But yes,
[00:41:22.160 --> 00:41:26.720]   you can also use it as a deep fake and make people say horrible things. And that's just the world
[00:41:26.720 --> 00:41:32.560]   we live in. Well, and I, but I also think that it's it is it's super exciting to someone who listens
[00:41:32.560 --> 00:41:37.680]   to only listens to things. Like if anything long form, there's more than about 500 words, I'm gonna
[00:41:38.320 --> 00:41:44.560]   I need to listen to it or I'm not gonna get it. You know, and I love the idea that potentially
[00:41:44.560 --> 00:41:51.200]   every magazine article in existence, every everything out there could be read, you know,
[00:41:51.200 --> 00:41:54.240]   that I don't have to sit there and read it. I can just put it on. I can be working on something
[00:41:54.240 --> 00:41:58.320]   else and listening to these magazine articles. I think it's great from the writers potentially,
[00:41:58.320 --> 00:42:05.360]   maybe not all writers, to print their print their voice. So we hear every writer, you hear them
[00:42:05.360 --> 00:42:09.600]   speaking their words. They don't have to sit down and do the recording. They just write it all out
[00:42:09.600 --> 00:42:13.520]   and they can choose to use their voice or use some other voice that they like or whatever. But the
[00:42:13.520 --> 00:42:19.120]   point is, is that every magazine becoming an audio magazine is in every book, you know, apples
[00:42:19.120 --> 00:42:23.840]   providing that service. I feel bad. I'm talking to a friend. There's like, I was thinking to get
[00:42:23.840 --> 00:42:28.960]   into reading books. I was like, you know, like there's not the time to get into that marketplace.
[00:42:28.960 --> 00:42:34.000]   There's like a marketplace for like smaller book sellers to have people write it. Yeah. And I was like,
[00:42:34.960 --> 00:42:39.600]   that ship might have passed like six months ago. You know, like it was around, it was around
[00:42:39.600 --> 00:42:45.680]   for 30 years. This was my retirement plan. I was going to read audio books. Forget that.
[00:42:45.680 --> 00:42:50.880]   Yeah, exactly. Or maybe I could just take maybe I could because, you know, part of the problem is
[00:42:50.880 --> 00:42:58.560]   it's even even with a really good reader like Jeff Gurner doing the, you know, Daniel Suarez books.
[00:42:58.560 --> 00:43:03.280]   It's $5,000 a book. That's a lot of work for $5,000. For me, it'd be a month of work. Easy.
[00:43:03.920 --> 00:43:10.400]   So it's, you know, it's kind of a, not a great income. But if you had an AI do it,
[00:43:10.400 --> 00:43:15.280]   maybe I'd license my voice and then it's easy, right? Easy work.
[00:43:15.280 --> 00:43:20.480]   Well, and I think that again, the biggest, the highest profile books and magazines are all
[00:43:20.480 --> 00:43:24.800]   going to be written, read by somebody that that is, is reading it and pulling the most out of it.
[00:43:24.800 --> 00:43:29.280]   And that's probably going to happen for at least the next five years. But the, the real excitement
[00:43:29.280 --> 00:43:34.000]   is the, for me, is the long tail. It's all the little things that we right now are listening to
[00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:38.240]   pretty bad audio. And I think that pretty soon, you know, we're going to just going to have something
[00:43:38.240 --> 00:43:42.160]   in our iPhone that says, do you just want to read what you, what you see here, you know,
[00:43:42.160 --> 00:43:47.440]   and we see that with dream reader, I think right now. Sure. Yeah. But the big problem is all the
[00:43:47.440 --> 00:43:51.760]   bibliography. That's what I run into. It's always it runs into the end of the, if you read research
[00:43:51.760 --> 00:43:58.240]   articles, I read like a 190, I listened to a 192 page NASA thing. And, but there was always
[00:43:58.240 --> 00:44:02.400]   these breaks for about five minutes at a time of all the, all the references.
[00:44:02.400 --> 00:44:03.800]   No, number two, and the very
[00:44:03.800 --> 00:44:06.000]   Epic. Oh God. Yeah.
[00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:09.680]   I'm driving. So I can't, I cannot do it. I just,
[00:44:09.680 --> 00:44:14.240]   like I'm still going to do that. I'm just going to work forward for Anthony Nielsen's in our
[00:44:14.240 --> 00:44:20.560]   discord. Anthony, when you use my voice for Descript to do that, did you tune down? Did you,
[00:44:20.560 --> 00:44:25.280]   was it, was it better than that? And you turned it down so that it was somewhere mechanical for
[00:44:25.280 --> 00:44:30.640]   the promo? Because I would, I mean, it, I was obviously Leo Laport was not, you know,
[00:44:30.640 --> 00:44:35.520]   how I was going to say it. I wonder if it could be more accurate that it sounds like the 4chan,
[00:44:35.520 --> 00:44:43.520]   you know, they had Ben Shapiro, beaten up, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. They had Rick Sanchez
[00:44:43.520 --> 00:44:48.000]   from Rick and Morty saying, I'm going to be my wife, Marty, which is, you know, I mean,
[00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:54.080]   that's 4chan in a nutshell. But apparently the, these were so well done. Donald Trump on Epstein
[00:44:54.080 --> 00:44:57.760]   Island, he was so, so well done that it caused problems.
[00:44:57.760 --> 00:45:02.560]   Sapphire, I will say, satire is never seen. That's true. You know, like, you know,
[00:45:02.560 --> 00:45:06.080]   let's do really, you know, and that is problematic, isn't it?
[00:45:06.080 --> 00:45:10.560]   I think that it's really important that people don't believe in what they see in here.
[00:45:10.560 --> 00:45:14.000]   From now on, that's the key, isn't it? I think that's, no, it's just in general.
[00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:18.000]   In general, it's been this way for about 100 years, maybe 200 years that you shouldn't really
[00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:23.680]   believe a single source of anything. But, but we now it's become very clear for us
[00:45:23.680 --> 00:45:27.840]   about why you shouldn't believe in a single source and possibly even multiple sources.
[00:45:27.840 --> 00:45:31.360]   You really have to take everything in. That's why we have courts. That's why we have evidence.
[00:45:31.360 --> 00:45:36.000]   Because things look very like we see the cell phone footage and then we don't know what the
[00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:39.200]   context is. And then we see the context and we're like, oh, okay, this makes more sense.
[00:45:39.200 --> 00:45:43.600]   You know, so, so these, you know, all of these things kind of weigh themselves out, you know,
[00:45:43.600 --> 00:45:48.640]   as you, as you go through those, those, those things. And so, you know, I think anybody thinking
[00:45:48.640 --> 00:45:55.600]   that they know what's happening around them, you know, on based on one sound clip or video clip,
[00:45:55.600 --> 00:45:59.440]   you know, I think we're erasing that pretty quickly. But it was all, it was always a little
[00:45:59.440 --> 00:46:06.000]   suspect or a lot suspect. It's just now really obvious. Yeah. Yeah. Here is 11 labs just from
[00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:12.240]   their front page, some sample of voices. The ultimate promise of technology is to make us
[00:46:12.240 --> 00:46:16.960]   master of a world that we command by the push of a button. This is good. It sounds no better.
[00:46:16.960 --> 00:46:20.880]   I don't think it sounds any different than the Apple voices we played a couple of weeks ago from
[00:46:20.880 --> 00:46:26.560]   there. And again, if I'm listening to it, I mean, there's the ultimate promise of technology is to
[00:46:26.560 --> 00:46:30.560]   make us master of a world that would hurt by the push of a button. Well, but you get to choose.
[00:46:30.560 --> 00:46:36.080]   I would not choose that one. Yeah. That was painful. Yeah. I can't get into 11 labs,
[00:46:36.080 --> 00:46:40.240]   even though I got accepted in the beta now because I think they're really kind of nervous.
[00:46:42.880 --> 00:46:47.440]   But I would totally pay. I mean, this is a service like like Descript, right? This is something that
[00:46:47.440 --> 00:46:52.880]   as a professional who does audio, I absolutely would pay for this. The ability to generate a model
[00:46:52.880 --> 00:46:58.160]   fairly easily that I can tweak. I mean, obviously the really good professional
[00:46:58.160 --> 00:47:04.160]   text to speech stuff, you can actually put in little notes in the text and punctuation that
[00:47:04.160 --> 00:47:08.880]   changes the voice. So you could get it to be really, really, really good. I definitely think
[00:47:08.880 --> 00:47:14.160]   there's a professional product here as well as just a screwing around on the internet.
[00:47:14.160 --> 00:47:19.600]   Who's Anthony put in the two different versions? He said, actually, 11 labs was a little bit better,
[00:47:19.600 --> 00:47:24.480]   but still not good. This is Descript, which is, by the way, we should mention what Descript does.
[00:47:24.480 --> 00:47:29.600]   So good. So Descript is a combination of different features, right? So it is a,
[00:47:29.600 --> 00:47:35.200]   it is a speech to text engine, and it is a podcast editing tool. And so what you do is you upload
[00:47:35.200 --> 00:47:40.560]   your audio and instead of it being a traditional linear editor, like logic or audition,
[00:47:40.560 --> 00:47:45.920]   it brings up a word processing document, essentially. And I use this from my, in 2020,
[00:47:45.920 --> 00:47:50.400]   I did the 20 max for 2020 project where I, it was a podcast that was like super edited,
[00:47:50.400 --> 00:47:56.160]   and I did a bunch of interviews. And the way that I made that show is I took quotes from the interviews
[00:47:56.160 --> 00:48:01.440]   in Descript, I'd run them all through, and I copied and pasted them in. And when you copy the text
[00:48:01.440 --> 00:48:07.040]   or edit the text, the underlying audio is edited too. So you can edit a whole podcast,
[00:48:07.040 --> 00:48:12.880]   not by editing audio clips, but by removing words and moving things around in a, in like a
[00:48:12.880 --> 00:48:17.600]   Microsoft Word document, essentially, except it's actually audio underlying it. And then when all
[00:48:17.600 --> 00:48:22.000]   of that, you can also tighten it up. They have a little linear editor, nonlinear editor you can
[00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:25.920]   look at and you can tighten it up. You can also do what I did, which is just export it out,
[00:48:25.920 --> 00:48:30.320]   and then finish it in logic or audition after it's done the heavy lifting. Couldn't have done that
[00:48:30.320 --> 00:48:36.080]   project without it. It is amazing. You can absolutely, I was so skeptical. And there are some things
[00:48:36.080 --> 00:48:41.760]   that are not perfect that you need to tweak, but you can get a podcast 98% of the way there,
[00:48:41.760 --> 00:48:46.160]   just by editing text, like you're in a text editor. It's funny. You know, we launched
[00:48:46.160 --> 00:48:51.920]   Twit 14, no more than that. It's 18 years ago. And at the time I was doing all the editing
[00:48:51.920 --> 00:48:55.440]   myself, and I would spend hours sometimes working on a twit, trying to get it usable.
[00:48:55.440 --> 00:49:00.160]   And had these tools been here, I don't know if Twit would have the same look and feel,
[00:49:00.160 --> 00:49:05.600]   with all the staff that we have, because it's just a different world. Now here's the,
[00:49:05.600 --> 00:49:12.080]   here's Anthony gave me this is Descript's version of my voice. I, Leo Leport of Soundmine,
[00:49:12.080 --> 00:49:17.520]   think Anthony should get a raise. Oh, Anthony, let's see the 11 labs version.
[00:49:17.520 --> 00:49:22.480]   This episode of Ask the Tech Guys is brought to you by Eight Sleep. Good sleep is the ultimate
[00:49:22.480 --> 00:49:26.960]   game changer. No, the pod cover is the ultimate sleep machine. It's kind of,
[00:49:27.520 --> 00:49:31.440]   doesn't sound like you're in your twenties. Yeah. Like you haven't really found yourself yet.
[00:49:31.440 --> 00:49:35.920]   Yeah. Still, it has, it has the resonance yet, but it's kind of like when you get started in radio,
[00:49:35.920 --> 00:49:39.360]   you don't have a distal, and broken your heart yet, Leo. That's what it sounds like.
[00:49:39.360 --> 00:49:44.640]   Actually, when I started in radio, my mom used to say, you sound like your voice is full of helium.
[00:49:44.640 --> 00:49:49.440]   It's because I don't know why, but I thought you're supposed to talk like this on the radio.
[00:49:49.440 --> 00:49:53.760]   It just, it just, it still has that optimism without that dash of pessimism and, and,
[00:49:53.760 --> 00:49:59.120]   and that's it. I got the, yeah, there's, it needs a cynicism dial to turn up the
[00:49:59.120 --> 00:50:04.240]   cynicism a little bit and we'll be okay. Let's take a little break. Can we come back? We'll break
[00:50:04.240 --> 00:50:10.880]   your heart even further. We're going to go to the rumor section. I think you probably know what's
[00:50:10.880 --> 00:50:17.520]   coming next, but before we do that, I do want to tell you about the email program that I've used
[00:50:17.520 --> 00:50:24.320]   for more than a decade. I have been using fast mail more than 10 years, I think. And I, what happened
[00:50:24.320 --> 00:50:29.040]   was for a long time, I was on, like most of us on Gmail and I thought, it's got a tree. Yeah,
[00:50:29.040 --> 00:50:33.680]   but I started realizing, you know, I'm seeing ads. I don't know exactly if I trust Google with my
[00:50:33.680 --> 00:50:38.560]   email. It doesn't have all the tools I want. I was getting more and more dissatisfied with Gmail.
[00:50:38.560 --> 00:50:46.160]   That's when I found fast mail and my life changed. Free email is not free. You pay with your privacy.
[00:50:47.360 --> 00:50:52.480]   For over 20 years, fast mail has been a leader in email privacy. Privacy first. Fast mail,
[00:50:52.480 --> 00:50:57.440]   your data stays yours. Better productivity features. Really, it is much more usable.
[00:50:57.440 --> 00:51:04.400]   Starts as little as $3 a month. Because fast mail, at fast mail, you're the customer,
[00:51:04.400 --> 00:51:10.560]   not the product. All fast mail data, you'll be glad to know stored in the US. Fast mail is fully
[00:51:10.560 --> 00:51:16.400]   GDPR compliant. They offer some really nice features, which I love. For instance, if you use
[00:51:16.400 --> 00:51:19.440]   Bitwarden, our other sponsor, you can use fast mail for
[00:51:19.440 --> 00:51:26.800]   obscured email addresses when you create new logins. So every login, every account you log into
[00:51:26.800 --> 00:51:31.760]   has, of course, a unique password, but also a unique login, a unique email address. But it still
[00:51:31.760 --> 00:51:39.600]   works because fast mail lets you create these addresses automatically using one password or Bitwarden.
[00:51:40.480 --> 00:51:47.040]   So that's just another way to add to secure. Another way fast mail really serves you and your privacy.
[00:51:47.040 --> 00:51:52.160]   Masked email protects your personal data because you can create multiple addresses when you sign up.
[00:51:52.160 --> 00:51:57.280]   I have a different website address for every site I've signed up to. Privacy is not all,
[00:51:57.280 --> 00:52:01.200]   though. You can customize your workflow. They've got a great webmail interface, really, really
[00:52:01.200 --> 00:52:07.120]   nice custom swipes, colors. They've got night mode. So you really will feel like, "Oh, I can use
[00:52:07.120 --> 00:52:12.880]   the webmail." And I do often, in fact, I have it pinned almost all my browsers, but then also
[00:52:12.880 --> 00:52:18.160]   because it's real iMac, not Google's pseudo iMac. It's real iMac. You can use it with any email
[00:52:18.160 --> 00:52:25.520]   client and it works beautifully. The anti-spam protection in fast mail is second to none. And if
[00:52:25.520 --> 00:52:33.200]   you are a more sophisticated user, they use SIV behind the scenes, an open source scripting
[00:52:33.200 --> 00:52:38.720]   language that you can use to really control your email. I have a long SIV script that I've been
[00:52:38.720 --> 00:52:45.200]   working on and using over the decade to improve. And now my email classification is flawless. It's
[00:52:45.200 --> 00:52:49.760]   fast. It's easy. It happens in the inbox. Whenever I log in from any email client or on the web,
[00:52:49.760 --> 00:52:55.760]   it's all done for me. Desktop mobile. They have a great mobile app. I love the fast mail app.
[00:52:55.760 --> 00:53:00.080]   You're going to get the most out of your email. And because they use an open source server,
[00:53:00.080 --> 00:53:04.960]   SIRIS, and they contribute back to the open source community, in fact, fast mail has done a lot
[00:53:04.960 --> 00:53:11.680]   to improve email for all of us. You know you're working with a company that really cares
[00:53:11.680 --> 00:53:18.320]   about this ecosystem. US-based support team, they're not just reading a notebook. They're
[00:53:18.320 --> 00:53:23.520]   email experts. When you reach out, they will put you first and they will help you because fast mail
[00:53:23.520 --> 00:53:29.520]   believes in working for customers as people to be cared for, not products to be exploited.
[00:53:29.520 --> 00:53:36.880]   Advertisers, sorry, you're out in the cold. You and your privacy are at the center. I use fast mail
[00:53:36.880 --> 00:53:42.800]   because it checks every single box, works great with every email program. Of course, Mac mail and
[00:53:42.800 --> 00:53:49.600]   Apple mail on the iOS platform, but it also works with all kinds of weird. I use mail mate, works
[00:53:49.600 --> 00:53:56.240]   really nicely with mail mate. Fast mail is the only way to go. I have used every email service out
[00:53:56.240 --> 00:54:01.440]   there and fast mail is the one I, in fact, I just signed up for another three years. I do it three
[00:54:01.440 --> 00:54:06.800]   years at a time because I know I'm never moving. Fast mail is easy to download your old data and
[00:54:06.800 --> 00:54:11.680]   import it into your new fast mail inbox inbox. You can actually, I have it still gathering email
[00:54:11.680 --> 00:54:16.960]   from Gmail from a multiple Gmail council. It goes into my inbox and with all those fancy filters you
[00:54:16.960 --> 00:54:23.120]   can create. They have a point and quick click way, very easy way to make filters. I never have to
[00:54:23.120 --> 00:54:28.400]   worry about getting my Gmail mixed in with my real mail, but I still get it. I still know it's there.
[00:54:28.400 --> 00:54:35.520]   New internet standards supported by fast mail for authentication are rapidly being adopted
[00:54:35.520 --> 00:54:41.120]   globally worldwide. That's how good they are. Hey, it's a new year. It's a new you. Let's do some

[00:55:13.760 --> 00:55:18.080]   about fast mail I hear from people, real email experts who say, oh yeah, that's the only email.
[00:55:18.080 --> 00:55:22.240]   It's the only way to go. I see that all the time on hacker news and elsewhere. Oh yeah,
[00:55:22.240 --> 00:55:28.240]   he's fast mail. It's like the early days of Google where John C. Devorak would test people
[00:55:28.240 --> 00:55:32.320]   and see how geeky they were. He said, what search engine do you use? And if they said
[00:55:32.320 --> 00:55:39.600]   excite or Altavista, you go. Now if you say Gmail or worse Yahoo or AOL, you can really rank people's
[00:55:39.600 --> 00:55:44.320]   expertise. But if they say fast mail, I know, I know, they know what they're doing. You should
[00:55:44.320 --> 00:55:52.960]   be using it. Fast mail. Make email yours. Fast mail dot com slash twit. And we thank them. I'm
[00:55:52.960 --> 00:55:59.360]   so plugging fast mail for years. I'm glad to finally get them on as an advertiser. Don't tell
[00:55:59.360 --> 00:56:02.000]   them that though, because you know, they probably get the free plugs no matter what.
[00:56:02.000 --> 00:56:11.760]   Let's talk real quickly about what's not going to happen. A folding iPad. Ming Chi Quo
[00:56:11.760 --> 00:56:21.280]   said in 2024 folding iPads to which Mark Gurman immediately tweeted, not hearing anything about
[00:56:21.280 --> 00:56:27.440]   a folding iPad in 2024. He does say there will be some exciting new iPad designs next year.
[00:56:28.400 --> 00:56:33.360]   OLED iPad pros entry level and a mini spec bump. We do need to update the mini and I love the
[00:56:33.360 --> 00:56:39.040]   mini that should be updated. As I wrote before 2023 will be a light year for the iPad and watch.
[00:56:39.040 --> 00:56:48.080]   But nothing about folding. Although this is a weird rumor. The the foldable iPad with carbon
[00:56:48.080 --> 00:56:55.040]   fiber kickstand that's Ming Chi Quo's speculation. Ross Young also tweeted. I have his tweet somewhere
[00:56:55.040 --> 00:57:01.120]   where is it? No, that's all my tweets are confusing me. Here we go. Ross Young have heard about a
[00:57:01.120 --> 00:57:09.120]   20.5 inch foldable notebook for 2025. But nothing about a foldable iPad for 2024.
[00:57:09.120 --> 00:57:17.120]   Maybe this is just good PR for the hinge company. Maybe maybe Ming Chi Quo was talking to the hinge
[00:57:17.120 --> 00:57:24.320]   folks. I have to say I've used foldable. I used the galaxy fold the flip. I've used a variety of
[00:57:24.320 --> 00:57:28.320]   foldables. I don't think foldable screens are really ready for prime time. They're not as good as real
[00:57:28.320 --> 00:57:33.440]   screens. I like the flip foam because it's kind of small. You can put it in your pocket and open it
[00:57:33.440 --> 00:57:38.320]   up to a normal size. But honestly, it's a gimmicky thing. I'm not surprised to hear this. I can't
[00:57:38.320 --> 00:57:44.160]   imagine. I'm surprised Apple would consider foldables of any kind. It's intriguing though.
[00:57:44.160 --> 00:57:51.520]   I love my 12.9 inch iPad Pro. But every time I put it in my bag, I really wish that if I could
[00:57:51.520 --> 00:57:57.680]   fold it in half and just make it just something that's but the size of a normal iPad or an iPad
[00:57:57.680 --> 00:58:02.720]   mini. Oh my god. Even if there were a tiny crease in the middle, I might even consider it.
[00:58:02.720 --> 00:58:09.120]   But yeah, you're right. Right now there isn't the compelling enough reason for the extra expense.
[00:58:09.120 --> 00:58:14.160]   And also the jury's still kind of out on the longevity of those kind of those kind of devices.
[00:58:14.160 --> 00:58:19.440]   But I love what's happening in Windows space with the source stuff every time that every time I try
[00:58:19.440 --> 00:58:24.080]   an interesting, a really interesting concept of a foldable, I think, oh, I've hoped this
[00:58:24.080 --> 00:58:29.840]   technology matures because I would enjoy having a device like this that I wouldn't
[00:58:29.840 --> 00:58:35.200]   wouldn't worry that, gee, I'm spending $1,200 extra for a for a notebook that's going to last maybe
[00:58:35.200 --> 00:58:42.640]   three years, not quite so long. And I'm excited about folding. I just don't think it's coming any
[00:58:42.640 --> 00:58:48.080]   time. It's not really. Yeah, I think it's a solid three or four years. And I will say I have some
[00:58:48.080 --> 00:58:53.760]   friends that have the foldable Samsung. And it still looks like they use it every day. And it
[00:58:53.760 --> 00:58:59.040]   opens up and it looks good. And I'm like, okay, well, this might work. But I have Apple did it before
[00:58:59.040 --> 00:59:06.240]   2025 or 2026. I'd be pretty, pretty surprised. Yeah. Yeah, I tried to think about like, why would
[00:59:06.240 --> 00:59:10.080]   you do this? Like, what is the reason for this? And the best thing I've come up with is,
[00:59:10.080 --> 00:59:16.080]   it's an iPad that is its own magic keyboard. Like, it's a nice big iPad. And then if you fold it
[00:59:16.080 --> 00:59:21.120]   into a laptop configuration with a kickstand, you can now use it in that kind of like,
[00:59:21.120 --> 00:59:26.560]   the bottom part becomes a keyboard and a pointing device. And the top part is still the apps running.
[00:59:26.560 --> 00:59:31.280]   But you know, that's so esoteric. And you're going to charge a fortune for it. And I don't know
[00:59:31.280 --> 00:59:36.000]   about that. And then the other idea is what Andy said, you know, you could fold it in half. But
[00:59:36.000 --> 00:59:40.320]   the question there is, is it usable when you fold it in half? Because most of these things
[00:59:40.320 --> 00:59:44.640]   have discovered that you want to, you want it to be an ini and not nowdy, right? So you want to
[00:59:44.640 --> 00:59:49.360]   kind of fold it in on itself. That means that now either it's nothing when it's closed,
[00:59:49.360 --> 00:59:53.280]   or you have to put another screen on the back and you're really going to put another screen on
[00:59:53.280 --> 00:59:57.440]   the back that turns it into an iPad mini. I don't need to work when it's closed. I think it protects
[00:59:57.440 --> 01:00:03.120]   the screen and protects the screen. Right. That's that's a choice is that it's just then what your
[01:00:03.120 --> 01:00:07.760]   benefit is just that when you're not using it, you can you can fold it away to protect it.
[01:00:07.760 --> 01:00:12.720]   Is that enough? And I just I it's hard for me to it's hard for me to see it as a proud owner of cargo
[01:00:12.720 --> 01:00:20.000]   pockets on like half of my pants. You know, like like I be pretty cool. But it's but it's
[01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:25.520]   it's really, really interesting. If someone were if the technology were mature enough that Apple
[01:00:25.520 --> 01:00:30.480]   would want to go for all the way, the idea of yes, you're right. For me, just the idea of having
[01:00:30.480 --> 01:00:36.880]   it a full size 12.9 screen that is easily more easily toteable than something that doesn't fold
[01:00:36.880 --> 01:00:43.600]   that in itself would be a win. But if they also added it so that it doesn't just fold fold flat,
[01:00:43.600 --> 01:00:51.840]   it also folds to like 100 and it's like 200 degrees 200 20 23 degrees. So now I can have sort of a
[01:00:51.840 --> 01:00:57.600]   half tablet that's sort of an easel sort of display. Yep. That would be interesting too. If I could
[01:00:57.600 --> 01:01:04.640]   also have a third way where I can fold it in half, but now because it's an intermediate fold,
[01:01:05.440 --> 01:01:09.600]   it's being interpreted as like a book with a left a left screen and a right screen.
[01:01:09.600 --> 01:01:14.960]   If that sort of thing were if Apple or any other company really pulled that off and actually got
[01:01:14.960 --> 01:01:20.320]   developers to get behind it and support it, now you're starting to get me wondering, gee,
[01:01:20.320 --> 01:01:25.040]   I was going to spend $3,000 on like a really nicely tricked out MacBook Pro.
[01:01:25.040 --> 01:01:34.240]   Maybe I don't know it's I love the idea of hardware that that changes itself to suit
[01:01:34.240 --> 01:01:40.480]   whatever situation you're in at the moment. We saw that revolution when we had user interfaces
[01:01:40.480 --> 01:01:46.000]   that could be completely glass that could totally reconfigure themselves on the on the iPhone screen.
[01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:49.760]   You don't you don't have to have physical call and answer buttons. You don't have to have physical
[01:01:49.760 --> 01:01:55.360]   quality keys on the on the thing. It could reconfigure itself based on the task that the app
[01:01:55.360 --> 01:02:01.520]   actually wants to want to help you out with physical conformity to that sort of thing is
[01:02:01.520 --> 01:02:04.560]   would be a really intriguing trick and I'd love to see it happen.
[01:02:04.560 --> 01:02:07.360]   Not time. I don't think it will happen anytime soon though.
[01:02:07.360 --> 01:02:13.840]   As for the concept of the folding laptop, I mean a folding lap a laptop is a folding laptop,
[01:02:13.840 --> 01:02:17.760]   right? Like it already is. Yeah, but we're talking a single screen across the whole.
[01:02:17.760 --> 01:02:20.800]   I think that's I think that's it and who's to say that.
[01:02:20.800 --> 01:02:24.640]   Okay, Mingxi Quo's sources are in the supply chain. He says that this is.
[01:02:24.640 --> 01:02:27.040]   So we're Ross Young's he's a display supply chain.
[01:02:27.040 --> 01:02:32.000]   And then Ross Young says a foldable laptop and it's like, well, they're probably seeing the same
[01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:36.880]   thing, right? And the idea here, what is this? What OS does this run? We talked about touchscreen
[01:02:36.880 --> 01:02:42.560]   MacBook Pros and we talked about would those be very conservative or would Apple make a convertible?
[01:02:42.560 --> 01:02:47.440]   The fact that all of these things have the same chips in them, it's it might be hard to tell
[01:02:47.440 --> 01:02:53.280]   whether you're looking at an iPad or a laptop if it's something that is basically designed to be
[01:02:53.280 --> 01:02:57.440]   flat like an iPad and also fold and turn into something in a laptop.
[01:02:57.440 --> 01:03:01.760]   Lenovo makes a make we don't have to guess because Lenovo makes a thinkpad X one
[01:03:01.760 --> 01:03:05.680]   fold that is exactly that. It has a big screen unfolds.
[01:03:05.680 --> 01:03:10.800]   And a touch screen that is also the keyboard and pointing right?
[01:03:10.800 --> 01:03:12.880]   Right. Yeah, it's kind of a weird.
[01:03:12.880 --> 01:03:17.600]   It's super weird, right? I mean, although we should say that Apple wouldn't do something
[01:03:17.600 --> 01:03:21.600]   weird with a keyboard, right? But yeah, well, that's the thing about it is like I get that Apple
[01:03:21.600 --> 01:03:25.200]   would want to experiment with this. But is this a product that Apple would be like, yep,
[01:03:25.200 --> 01:03:28.720]   we nailed it. It's going to be great. It's like it seems seems a little bit weird.
[01:03:28.720 --> 01:03:34.880]   And again, and I'm looking at this thinkpad video, it's got the same problem as the Galaxy Fold,
[01:03:34.880 --> 01:03:39.520]   which is those foldable screens are not very good. They're not good. They're hot screens you want.
[01:03:39.520 --> 01:03:43.840]   The Apple gets pride in their screen quality, right? Yeah. Look, and you know, when I look at Lisa's
[01:03:43.840 --> 01:03:51.440]   M2 14 inch MacBook Pro, that screen is mind bogglingly good. I mean, it's so good
[01:03:52.240 --> 01:03:58.000]   last night. I I she said you can play with it for five minutes. No, she was very generous.
[01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:01.600]   I make an account on it. You could play with it, bring it to work, review it. I said, well, Jason
[01:04:01.600 --> 01:04:06.960]   are reviewed it. But I did open up I went to YouTube immediately and opened up of 4K HDR,
[01:04:06.960 --> 01:04:13.520]   120 frame per second video. And it was almost three dimensional. That screen is so good. You
[01:04:13.520 --> 01:04:18.720]   won't get anything like that on a foldable screen. And I don't think Apple wants to. If
[01:04:18.720 --> 01:04:24.960]   they're upping the ante on there, you said, Jason, it's the best screen Apple's ever made for the
[01:04:24.960 --> 01:04:30.080]   Mac. Certainly. I think it is for the Mac. I mean, we could debate about like, OLED on iPhone and
[01:04:30.080 --> 01:04:35.120]   stuff. But on the Mac, the fact that it's promotion, that it's got those mini LED backlighting. So
[01:04:35.120 --> 01:04:41.200]   it's not perfect OLED like, but it's pretty good. It's that black faded away. Right. Yeah.
[01:04:41.200 --> 01:04:47.760]   Like it's the best. It's stay of the art for a Mac display for sure. Yeah. So I just, I just,
[01:04:47.760 --> 01:04:53.280]   and I don't think folding is going to get better much because it's just it's the nature of the
[01:04:53.280 --> 01:04:59.840]   beast. It has to be a soft plastic screen to fold. I mean, you can fold an OLED. All
[01:04:59.840 --> 01:05:05.360]   ads are just, you know, a thin sheet of material. But it's just a few years and years and years.
[01:05:05.360 --> 01:05:12.960]   Like I've been sort of impatient because like with the when a design for a laptop for a mobile
[01:05:12.960 --> 01:05:17.600]   computer is this static for this long, you have a keyboard and a pointy device on one side of it,
[01:05:17.600 --> 01:05:22.000]   you got a hinge and then you got a screen at the other side of the hinge. That's, it's not a
[01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:28.800]   solved problem yet. I think that there's stuff that could be done if both manufacturers, software
[01:05:28.800 --> 01:05:34.640]   developers and users decided to get more adventurous and maybe it's not necessarily a sin that the
[01:05:34.640 --> 01:05:39.360]   three aren't getting together and deciding to head off on that adventure together. It's, it's possible
[01:05:39.360 --> 01:05:44.000]   they just want something that's practical, usable, that's exceptional in its own way that's a
[01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:48.720]   in the refinement of this old idea. I just think that we're leaving, we're leaving some money on
[01:05:48.720 --> 01:05:52.800]   the table here. There's some great ideas that aren't being really exploited because there are
[01:05:52.800 --> 01:05:56.320]   too many people who are going to say, oh, that's stupid. Oh, Steve would never have approved
[01:05:56.320 --> 01:06:01.040]   something like that or Apple would never make something like that. It's, it's, it's interesting.
[01:06:01.040 --> 01:06:09.280]   I, I like the idea of it being out there for a crazy 3% of the market to buy and to be these,
[01:06:09.280 --> 01:06:14.080]   to be the only 30,000 of these ever made, but these 30,000 that people would never ever trade in a
[01:06:14.080 --> 01:06:20.720]   million years. Are you ready? Let's get back to sports because really honestly, this should be
[01:06:20.720 --> 01:06:28.480]   a sports show. Finally, finally, finally. Are you ready in a week from Sunday? It's a super bowl
[01:06:28.480 --> 01:06:36.320]   L-V-I or as I call it, Lovey. Super Bowl Lovey. Lovey. Lovey. It's a super bowl Lovey.
[01:06:36.320 --> 01:06:43.120]   Rihanna will be the halftime show. And unlike previous Super Bowls, as long as I can.
[01:06:43.120 --> 01:06:46.720]   I think you mean the Apple music halftime show, Leo. I'm sorry. Excuse me.
[01:06:46.720 --> 01:06:53.520]   Fortunately, we're on an Apple based podcast. So we can tie this right in. Well, it was Pepsi
[01:06:53.520 --> 01:06:59.760]   forever, right? I mean, yeah, it was always it's called. It's called really hard to compete with Apple.
[01:06:59.760 --> 01:07:04.080]   If Apple wants, you know, like, how about we just kind of. You think they outbid Pepsi or Pepsi?
[01:07:04.080 --> 01:07:08.720]   You said, we've spent enough on this. I think I think they walked up the NFL and they said,
[01:07:08.720 --> 01:07:12.720]   do you want to continue to sell this sugar water to kids or do you want to change the world?
[01:07:12.720 --> 01:07:19.200]   They pull the jobs on them. So they just, they just, they just, they just, they just put up a big
[01:07:19.200 --> 01:07:24.080]   wad of million dollar. A million, a million, and they started flicking one, flicking million dollar
[01:07:24.080 --> 01:07:27.280]   bills off the end and going, how much does it cost for us to own this? Like, I just, I just think
[01:07:27.280 --> 01:07:32.080]   to know. Yeah. So of course, one of the reasons Apple can do that is because they have multiple
[01:07:32.080 --> 01:07:38.800]   ways to market this whole dang thing. Press release came out yesterday. They are launching Rihanna's
[01:07:38.800 --> 01:07:46.400]   incredible music catalog. You can hear like never before with spatial audio. And there it is.
[01:07:46.400 --> 01:07:55.440]   The it's all spatial audio plus they'll, they'll be Apple music sing their karaoke with Rihanna.
[01:07:55.440 --> 01:08:01.680]   Take the mic on your favorite Rihanna songs to hit those solos, perform duets, sing back up and more
[01:08:01.680 --> 01:08:07.120]   on all compatible iPhone and iPad models as well as the new Apple TV 4K Apple music radio will be
[01:08:07.120 --> 01:08:11.680]   on the ground and in the stands to soundtrack all the festivities.
[01:08:12.240 --> 01:08:16.720]   Leaning if you're a Rihanna fan, I guess this is great news, right? Leaning up to Rihanna's big night,
[01:08:16.720 --> 01:08:23.280]   special exclusive programming on Apple music radio will include halftime hype radio,
[01:08:23.280 --> 01:08:29.360]   a 10 part series, reflecting on some of the most notable Super Bowl halftime performances of all
[01:08:29.360 --> 01:08:34.720]   time. Okay, that might be interesting. Rihanna revisited radio an eight episode round table.
[01:08:35.520 --> 01:08:42.400]   If you thought we were overdoing this, wait till you hear Rihanna revisited radio noting the
[01:08:42.400 --> 01:08:50.480]   cultural impact of the elusive singer's catalog and live from Super Bowl lovey featuring daily live
[01:08:50.480 --> 01:08:56.000]   broadcasts that capture all the excitement in Arizona leading into the weekend with Apple music
[01:08:56.000 --> 01:09:03.680]   radio host Zainlo, Ebro Darden and Odessa Lexus, who by the way, and Odessa and Odessa Lexus is going
[01:09:03.680 --> 01:09:11.280]   to interview Rihanna on February 9th at 10 a.m. in the Super Bowl lovey halftime show press conference.
[01:09:11.280 --> 01:09:17.840]   So and you can watch that on Apple music's TikTok, Instagram, YouTube and Twitter or on the NFL network.
[01:09:17.840 --> 01:09:24.720]   And the thing is, is this is stuff that Pepsi can't do. No, like there's Pepsi doesn't own the number
[01:09:24.720 --> 01:09:29.040]   one music store in the world. Well, not only the number one music store, when you when you when you
[01:09:29.040 --> 01:09:34.880]   see Zainlo coming in, it's the largest radio station in the world. Like, you know, is it? Do you know
[01:09:34.880 --> 01:09:38.960]   what the numbers are on Apple radio? No, they do not publish those numbers. But we don't know if
[01:09:38.960 --> 01:09:44.240]   it's the largest radio show in the world. So it's global. It gives it a little bit of it as a
[01:09:44.240 --> 01:09:49.440]   advantage. But I haven't finished it. There's more. You also can get
[01:09:50.720 --> 01:09:58.800]   a NFL team playlists, an official collection of 32 playlists featuring the top songs that each
[01:09:58.800 --> 01:10:06.400]   NFL team listens to in the locker room, the way and on game day. Actually, the night this
[01:10:06.400 --> 01:10:10.640]   sounds kind of made up, but the Niners do when they come on the field have a giant boom box
[01:10:10.640 --> 01:10:17.680]   playing whatever song. So you'll be able to hear warm up playlist created by Travis Kelsey of the
[01:10:17.680 --> 01:10:23.760]   Chiefs, Stefan Diggs of the Bills, Trayvon Diggs of the Cowboys, Devonta Adams of the Raiders,
[01:10:23.760 --> 01:10:28.160]   and Dak Prescott of the Cowboys. Hey, where's Brock Purdy's playlist?
[01:10:28.160 --> 01:10:37.360]   I love you. You love me. We're a happy family plus a throwback video playlist,
[01:10:37.360 --> 01:10:42.960]   revisiting halftime performances from past games. I'd listen to the Prince one. That'd be good.
[01:10:44.160 --> 01:10:48.480]   And then it's the Super Bowl halftime show, which I didn't know this is they say is the most watched
[01:10:48.480 --> 01:10:52.160]   musical performance of the year. How much do you think they paid for this?
[01:10:52.160 --> 01:11:01.280]   Holy komoly. Yeah. 32 playlists from ever. What did they send a reporter into each locker room and
[01:11:01.280 --> 01:11:05.680]   say, what do you listen to right now? Right now? How about right now? So don't forget it. I bet
[01:11:05.680 --> 01:11:10.000]   they have to pay for all of that. Sure. That's not going to roger Goodell gives nothing away.
[01:11:10.800 --> 01:11:16.000]   Yeah, exactly. It was it wasn't it recently that or at least a few years ago that it was they
[01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:24.640]   was spread out that the NFL wanted to felt it felt as though doing the halftime show was such a
[01:11:24.640 --> 01:11:30.240]   publicity coup for the performer that they should be paying the NFL a share of their touring royalties
[01:11:30.240 --> 01:11:34.800]   for the next year. So yeah, I'm sure they found a way to monetize all of this.
[01:11:36.400 --> 01:11:41.360]   Somebody it's it's not it sounds like a lot. I'm just saying it sounds like a lot. Somebody
[01:11:41.360 --> 01:11:47.120]   somebody in Fred in the chatroom says that Super Bowl Sunday will always is now and will always be
[01:11:47.120 --> 01:11:56.400]   the Janet Jackson appreciation day. Prince Prince Prince Prince owned Prince bought and locked
[01:11:56.400 --> 01:12:00.560]   that entire event and nobody has ever come close to him. That's I'm sorry.
[01:12:00.560 --> 01:12:06.160]   It's Jason. Do you have a conflicting opinion? Can we try on some drama? Prince no sorry Prince
[01:12:06.160 --> 01:12:12.400]   purple rain in the rain. That was amazing. That was amazing. They at some point they came to him
[01:12:12.400 --> 01:12:16.240]   beforehand and they're like I think it's going to rain and he said I hope it rains hard. I hope
[01:12:16.240 --> 01:12:22.640]   it rains hard. Can you make it rain more? Make it rain more. That was that's right. Can you make it
[01:12:22.640 --> 01:12:28.480]   rain more? Great. Just the best. There have there have been some great Super Bowl. Have had
[01:12:28.480 --> 01:12:34.720]   never gaga leaping off into space with the drones and I really like the weekend when he did it.
[01:12:34.720 --> 01:12:38.400]   Did you think we're going into the like the hall of mirrors and everything else? I really did.
[01:12:38.400 --> 01:12:44.720]   You like it. I liked it. Yeah. There is of course Janet Jackson and Justin Timberlake and the famous
[01:12:44.720 --> 01:12:53.200]   wardrobe malfunction which is the most I think still rewound segment on television.
[01:12:53.200 --> 01:12:57.440]   The Tivo did that thing where they said it was. I had a Tivo at the time and you know what I
[01:12:57.440 --> 01:13:01.360]   contributed to that number because I couldn't. There's the weekend in his hall of mirrors.
[01:13:01.360 --> 01:13:06.080]   That's how I looked during that. I loved it. That was was that last year? I think that was last
[01:13:06.080 --> 01:13:12.240]   year or was it the year before? Oh no last year was awesome. Last year was hip hop's legends in a
[01:13:12.240 --> 01:13:18.080]   little house that they built on the field. That was really good. That one was good. This one will
[01:13:18.080 --> 01:13:27.360]   be good. See that it's good when the artist is like I'm going to be playing to. I'm doing a 10
[01:13:27.360 --> 01:13:32.800]   minute arena show. I'm doing a live arena show. But it's less good. But it's like we're going to
[01:13:32.800 --> 01:13:36.720]   build this. We're going to build a video set in the middle of the field and we're basically doing
[01:13:36.720 --> 01:13:43.040]   a really expensive live performance of the VMAs. I was like no don't do that. Feed off the energy
[01:13:43.040 --> 01:13:48.800]   and have the energy feed you. That's going to be good. All I every time I see them all I think is
[01:13:48.800 --> 01:13:53.280]   as someone who does live events and has to load in and load out I'm like that's really hard.
[01:13:53.280 --> 01:14:00.800]   Oh yeah. Can you imagine? They rolled a house out of the field and then for some reason Fiddy
[01:14:00.800 --> 01:14:07.440]   Set was hanging upside down from the ceiling and Snoop Dogg rose up through the it was crazy.
[01:14:07.440 --> 01:14:19.760]   It was wild. Eminem. The pounds per inch allowed on the set on the field is like in the requirements.
[01:14:19.760 --> 01:14:24.080]   Like you know like you can't you can't damage the field. You can't damage the field. The field
[01:14:24.080 --> 01:14:29.680]   takes a year to develop and they start growing it literally a year ahead of time and they're pretty
[01:14:29.680 --> 01:14:35.440]   picky about it. And so the requirements that go into that are just insane.
[01:14:35.440 --> 01:14:39.200]   And so but it's I mean they've only lost power once.
[01:14:39.200 --> 01:14:45.920]   I was at that. I was at that super near New Orleans. That's 10 years ago.
[01:14:45.920 --> 01:14:51.760]   Like in a couple of days for every live streamer that's the get out of jail free card which is
[01:14:51.760 --> 01:14:55.520]   you can use it once as a mulligan which is even the Super Bowl lost power.
[01:14:55.520 --> 01:15:00.560]   It was it actually helped the Niners and Niners came back after the power outage.
[01:15:00.560 --> 01:15:04.880]   But yeah Beyonce was a Super Bowl halft. I wasn't the greatest show I've ever seen but Destiny's
[01:15:04.880 --> 01:15:10.720]   Child. So that's one of the things you do. I mean it's Rihanna but it's not just Rihanna.
[01:15:10.720 --> 01:15:16.240]   And eventually they will start to learn Elvis Presley's going to show up as well and Frank Sinatra
[01:15:16.240 --> 01:15:21.920]   or something. So it'll make it like a bigger deal than it already is. Right. Because they got to get
[01:15:21.920 --> 01:15:26.720]   everybody. They got to get America. They got to get Hank Williams Jr. or somebody too. You got
[01:15:26.720 --> 01:15:34.000]   to get the whole the whole demographic. Are you ready for football? Yes. But I think also I think
[01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:40.720]   that the asking the musical question. Are you ready for some football? Are you ready for some?
[01:15:40.720 --> 01:15:46.320]   There's a reason I wanted to hang out with you. Yell that and then just cut to a guy going
[01:15:46.320 --> 01:15:53.440]   indeed. You know. Okay. You got your impactable timing. Harrows.
[01:15:53.440 --> 01:15:57.440]   I'm a technical timing. So what do you think is the course to bring us back to Apple? Yes.
[01:15:57.440 --> 01:16:03.040]   That this is just the beginning. If Apple's a if Apple got this in a multi-year purchase
[01:16:03.680 --> 01:16:08.160]   you know we're assuming that we're going to start seeing AR and so on and so forth.
[01:16:08.160 --> 01:16:13.920]   This is the beginning. MLS becomes a training ground. Super Bowl becomes a place where you start
[01:16:13.920 --> 01:16:20.000]   adding AR. You start adding things that you're going to build around it. It's super. I mean and
[01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:24.640]   if you're talking about launching a headset even if not everyone can have it for the people who
[01:16:24.640 --> 01:16:29.920]   have it proving what you can do. You know that they'll be you know Apple will spend a lot of money on
[01:16:29.920 --> 01:16:35.520]   the AR and VR solutions that you might have around this. This is going to be wild. That's of course huge.
[01:16:35.520 --> 01:16:40.880]   You can see just even from everything I just described Apple seeing this is a massive marking
[01:16:40.880 --> 01:16:46.400]   opportunity. It also means there will be at least one probably many Apple ads in the Super Bowl right?
[01:16:46.400 --> 01:16:54.880]   Very famously Apple's 1984 ad debuted and played only once nationally on the Super Bowl.
[01:16:56.640 --> 01:17:02.080]   To introduce the Macintosh back in 1984. Do they I can't remember? Do they always have
[01:17:02.080 --> 01:17:05.360]   super bowl? I think they run basic ads. I don't think they do. They don't do special.
[01:17:05.360 --> 01:17:10.560]   They don't like something crazy. I mean yeah and then the new thing now in the Super Bowl is to run
[01:17:10.560 --> 01:17:15.520]   a short ad in the Super Bowl but tell people that there's a longer version like like my favorite ad
[01:17:15.520 --> 01:17:22.720]   which is incredibly ironic. The most ironic ad ever made is the FTX Larry David one.
[01:17:22.720 --> 01:17:28.800]   Oh yeah. You can trust this. Everybody says no no no and it's literally my favorite ad ever
[01:17:28.800 --> 01:17:32.000]   made and I'm not I'm not a big fan of Kirby or two. Fusio for some reason.
[01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:36.240]   Yeah it doesn't. What's funny is there was a two and a half minute version. There's a really long
[01:17:36.240 --> 01:17:41.440]   version. I saw Ice which is great because when I already didn't got sued over this ad but he's
[01:17:41.440 --> 01:17:47.760]   being sued because he recommended FTX which turned out was a pie game but here's the thing he did
[01:17:47.760 --> 01:17:52.160]   never recommend his his get out of geo credit. He said it wouldn't work. Yeah.
[01:17:52.160 --> 01:17:59.040]   He was in the whole time. He said I know these things like like he said the I don't know how you
[01:17:59.040 --> 01:18:04.560]   could sue Larry David for it because in the whole ad and every iteration he says it's not going to
[01:18:04.560 --> 01:18:10.000]   work. I was his lawyer. So yeah I would get he said what do you say recommendation? I hate this.
[01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:17.120]   I told you not to do it. I was right. Also what's the what's the over-under on a special video
[01:18:17.120 --> 01:18:20.880]   from Ted Lasso introducing the introducing time show? There you go.
[01:18:20.880 --> 01:18:26.560]   Yeah. Nope. That's like even money. So we need a we need a new bingo card. We need a bingo card for
[01:18:26.560 --> 01:18:31.920]   this first Super Bowl lovey and apples like marketing in there because there's it's going to be
[01:18:31.920 --> 01:18:38.000]   we're actually when I thought briefly for one brief shining moment that there might be a 49ers
[01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:44.400]   appearance in the Super Bowl. I moved all of our Sunday shows to Saturday so but I'm stuck with it
[01:18:44.400 --> 01:18:49.600]   now. I don't want to watch this guys. Oh it'll be fun. I want to see Rihanna anyway.
[01:18:49.600 --> 01:18:55.520]   Twit and as the tech guys will be on Saturday February 11th so that we can
[01:18:55.520 --> 01:19:00.960]   cry into our beer on Sunday February 12th during Super Bowl. Lovey.
[01:19:00.960 --> 01:19:08.080]   No but I admit that at this point it used to be you'd maybe watch it for the for the game and then
[01:19:08.080 --> 01:19:13.120]   you got you quickly got tired of that then you'd watch for the commercials and then of course the
[01:19:13.120 --> 01:19:17.520]   the ad business realized that realize that we enjoy the commercials and they ruined it by making it
[01:19:17.520 --> 01:19:22.800]   way way by exploiting that way to and taking all the fun out of it. Now I actually really do enjoy
[01:19:22.800 --> 01:19:28.640]   like the halftime show because it's one of those super super rare times where you see truly live
[01:19:28.640 --> 01:19:34.080]   performance where if something screws up you got to go forward you can't like you can't redo it you
[01:19:34.080 --> 01:19:39.920]   can't cut away but whatever happens happens and if it rains right in the right in the middle of
[01:19:39.920 --> 01:19:44.160]   Princess set and you're wondering how those dancers are going to continue to dance in their stiletto
[01:19:44.160 --> 01:19:51.440]   heels and if the most incredible funk fusion guitarist is going to be electrocuted in a live
[01:19:51.440 --> 01:19:56.080]   performance that's what's going to happen. You want to watch it. You don't want to miss it.
[01:19:56.080 --> 01:20:00.000]   It's what everybody will be talking about around the water cooler the next day.
[01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:05.440]   All right. It's amazing to ever you ever you ever watch like they have like some of the like
[01:20:05.440 --> 01:20:09.360]   pre before they just before they the Super Bowl realized that the halftime show could be a musical
[01:20:09.360 --> 01:20:14.880]   extravaganza when it was really just let's have some something to fill time like between between
[01:20:14.880 --> 01:20:18.880]   the two halves that would maybe sort of entertain the people who are in the stadium. There was like
[01:20:18.880 --> 01:20:25.760]   this absolute dumpster fire of a show where they had like a stage magician do this musical number
[01:20:25.760 --> 01:20:31.760]   about magic and none of the magic tricks they did in the middle of the of the stadium worked at all
[01:20:31.760 --> 01:20:37.600]   and it was just oh my god and everyone the booth was like well no one's watching this thank god
[01:20:37.600 --> 01:20:43.280]   thank god we didn't actually like risk anybody's reputation on this it is such a funky it's such a
[01:20:43.280 --> 01:20:48.800]   it's such a weird thing to watch these pre like these early nineteen nineteen nineteen eighties
[01:20:48.800 --> 01:20:53.760]   Super Bowl shows because they're like okay they have not figured that out yet yeah it's funny I
[01:20:53.760 --> 01:20:59.760]   mean even though the graphics on old football games are so horrible they're so terrible they
[01:20:59.760 --> 01:21:07.520]   think the TV buzz whenever they come on. I actually I wonder if we're gonna look back 20 years
[01:21:07.520 --> 01:21:15.840]   from now when at when it's you know zappl presents Super Bowl whatever L L L L L if we will look back
[01:21:15.840 --> 01:21:21.840]   on these and say well those are funky I feels like they're pretty good but there's a will be even
[01:21:21.840 --> 01:21:27.920]   4k choose the camera angle haha Fox has been doing play-offs in 4k I've been watching them in 4k
[01:21:27.920 --> 01:21:33.520]   on YouTube TV it's an upscale 1080p signal but it's still the best signal you've ever seen for a
[01:21:34.240 --> 01:21:39.680]   for a football game yeah it looks like we'll say fuck YouTube's come a long way like when they
[01:21:39.680 --> 01:21:44.720]   first started it was pretty YouTube TV football was pretty choppy you know it was it was oh no I
[01:21:44.720 --> 01:21:50.160]   was like it was on watch I don't know if this work and now it's just when I turn it on I just
[01:21:50.160 --> 01:21:54.400]   it just looks like TV like it's just it's it's really come you know in the last I don't know three
[01:21:54.400 --> 01:21:59.280]   years I got into it almost immediately I could cut at this point I there's it's basically and
[01:21:59.280 --> 01:22:05.760]   it costs as much that's the good news it costs as much as cable so it's just like cable ever was
[01:22:05.760 --> 01:22:11.520]   I mean it's better than cable ever was though I mean oh yeah the DVR I hit I record I don't know
[01:22:11.520 --> 01:22:15.840]   how many hundreds of everything because I just go record all of us into the future yeah and because
[01:22:15.840 --> 01:22:21.040]   I do it for like lower thirds and super sources and sweeper research you know so I you know I'm
[01:22:21.040 --> 01:22:24.960]   gonna go back and look at things and but I never know what I'm gonna look at and so and then when
[01:22:24.960 --> 01:22:29.280]   when great pieces of 60 minutes surprise us because there hasn't there's only been like six of them
[01:22:29.280 --> 01:22:34.320]   in the last 20 years I can still go find you you you were we were texting back and forth last
[01:22:34.320 --> 01:22:40.400]   week and you said you guys see the Rick Rubin piece on 60 minutes I went to YouTube and they had
[01:22:40.400 --> 01:22:44.720]   little snippets but they didn't have the whole piece and then I went oh I've been DVRing 60 minutes
[01:22:44.720 --> 01:22:49.040]   for the last 20 years yeah I could just look on YouTube TV and there it was and I watched the
[01:22:49.040 --> 01:22:54.720]   whole thing in its entirety which was I agree with you a really interesting piece about the
[01:22:54.720 --> 01:23:00.000]   weirdest record producer ever but maybe no I can't say that because Phil Spector was in there too so
[01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:05.040]   just get it just getting Johnny Cash back into the recording no you're
[01:23:05.040 --> 01:23:11.520]   do it every your your your your remit is do record whatever songs you want we will we will
[01:23:11.520 --> 01:23:15.920]   we will have people standing by if you can just basically play and saying whatever you want
[01:23:15.920 --> 01:23:19.440]   it's that that that got that opened the gates to heaven for him doesn't matter how many murders
[01:23:19.440 --> 01:23:25.680]   he he committed I later looked it up he said he saw he went to a dive bar and there were like a
[01:23:25.680 --> 01:23:30.880]   couple hundred people watching Johnny Cash like who whose career was over basically and he said
[01:23:30.880 --> 01:23:36.160]   this guy's too good and he said Johnny and he got he got a got him on I don't think he got him on
[01:23:36.160 --> 01:23:41.680]   Def Jam but he got him on some label he was running and and he said and the I think the first song he
[01:23:41.680 --> 01:23:49.440]   did was Trent Reznor's Hurt yeah and it was my boggling right that that's so classic
[01:23:49.440 --> 01:23:54.320]   classic Rick Rubin though he he I went and then we found the song from Rick from Nine Snails like
[01:23:54.320 --> 01:24:00.000]   who thinks that Nine Snails is something that would go well with Johnny Cash and it's and his version
[01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:05.920]   is you know definitive Johnny Johnny Cash tells the story about how like as soon as he got his offer
[01:24:05.920 --> 01:24:10.880]   he's responsible like I want to record every song that I've never been able to record before
[01:24:10.880 --> 01:24:17.920]   before I die and Hurt was actually Rick Rubin which sent him tapes to sort of suggest songs that
[01:24:17.920 --> 01:24:23.040]   would also be good and he would have to he tells a story about how he kept sending putting it on
[01:24:23.040 --> 01:24:28.720]   the tape more again and again and then after like I could because he would put like Hurt number one
[01:24:28.720 --> 01:24:34.800]   on the tape again and again and again yeah but he was right if you haven't heard and then of course
[01:24:34.800 --> 01:24:41.440]   it made Johnny Cash hip all over again and it really made him bigger than he'd ever been frankly
[01:24:41.440 --> 01:24:45.920]   and and you can hear it from the other side if you watch if you go to Netflix and watch Sound
[01:24:45.920 --> 01:24:52.800]   a song Exploder has Trent Reznor talking because they cover song Exploder talks about Hurt and
[01:24:52.800 --> 01:24:59.040]   and Trent Reznor talks about the experience of Johnny Cash playing his song you know and so
[01:24:59.040 --> 01:25:02.400]   so that's the whole like there's a lot of inner and inner and inner and inner and that's one of the
[01:25:02.400 --> 01:25:09.040]   most amazing if you haven't heard it both listen to it both but listen to the recording because
[01:25:09.040 --> 01:25:15.920]   it's late in Johnny's life I think he's ill yeah there is a it is profoundly moving you hear
[01:25:15.920 --> 01:25:21.440]   the hurt in his voice it's profoundly moving it's the difference between a young man singing that
[01:25:21.440 --> 01:25:26.960]   line and his old man who's clearly who sounds like he's close to not not dying but close to the end
[01:25:26.960 --> 01:25:31.920]   he's like I hurt myself today just so I could feel and talk about everyone I've everyone I've
[01:25:31.920 --> 01:25:36.960]   I've loved goes away in the end like okay I'm the I'm 83 everyone I've loved is just basically
[01:25:36.960 --> 01:25:44.720]   has died before me I'm alone right now and you're like oh my god man man man hey speaking of music
[01:25:44.720 --> 01:25:51.360]   Jim Dowrympel is now on Mastodon if you want to follow him very pleased to see him J Dowrympel
[01:25:51.920 --> 01:25:57.680]   at Mastodon.social I immediately followed him when this was reported by our RSC and Phil Schiller
[01:25:57.680 --> 01:26:03.920]   has confirmed yep that's me on Mastodon I feel Schiller the former chief marketing officer at
[01:26:03.920 --> 01:26:11.280]   Apple who's still an Apple fellow left Twitter a few months ago in a huff as did I and it is
[01:26:11.280 --> 01:26:19.120]   indeed his account not a not somebody posing as P Schiller at MS at Mastodon.social they're all
[01:26:19.120 --> 01:26:25.600]   going to Mastodon.social which probably is not the first place I would go these days it's so big
[01:26:25.600 --> 01:26:30.800]   in fact it was just get just got D dust if you are a Twitter listener you can of course go to our
[01:26:30.800 --> 01:26:39.200]   Mastodon and follow all of these characters that is Twitter.social but do say something like
[01:26:39.200 --> 01:26:44.400]   I heard you mention in a Mac break because I won't I'm not letting people in who don't show that they
[01:26:44.400 --> 01:26:51.120]   are listeners because I want to be a community of to it listeners particularly he says I am an
[01:26:51.120 --> 01:26:58.000]   Apple fellow Illumina director Boston College trustee and Bowdoin trustee I love to scuba dive
[01:26:58.000 --> 01:27:05.280]   I drum to Prague rock I drive sports cars shoot photos play games and read sci-fi how could you
[01:27:05.280 --> 01:27:11.280]   doubt that that's the real Phil Schiller yep and and and he says what's his name is that Johnny
[01:27:11.280 --> 01:27:18.160]   Bravo who is that throwing a boomerang on his as his as his but we have to explain to him
[01:27:18.160 --> 01:27:22.000]   how he can he would have solved a lot of who is that
[01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:30.320]   he would have solved a lot of question marks about his reality if he had just used
[01:27:30.320 --> 01:27:37.200]   Mastodon's very nice system of validating yourself. Yes. But how do you do that how do you go to the
[01:27:37.200 --> 01:27:42.960]   person who is in charge of the leadership pages at apple.com probably can't do it
[01:27:42.960 --> 01:27:48.240]   but but I'm guessing he could do it at Illumina or the Schiller Institute at Boston College he
[01:27:48.240 --> 01:27:52.960]   probably could go to the Schiller Institute and say could you put rel.me in there in that link
[01:27:52.960 --> 01:27:57.920]   next to my name that's all you have to do and it turns green then people know it's you anyway
[01:27:57.920 --> 01:28:04.080]   he's verified it to nine to five and others he's not the most interesting person on Mastodon but
[01:28:04.080 --> 01:28:10.160]   you know what the hell. Hey everybody it's Leo LaPorte the founder and host of many of the

[01:30:54.160 --> 01:30:58.880]   where we are today without the twit network. That's just one example. Mark McCurry who's the CEO of
[01:30:58.880 --> 01:31:04.880]   authentic he was actually one of the first people to buy ads on our network. He's been with us for
[01:31:04.880 --> 01:31:11.600]   16 years. He said and I'm quoting the feedback from many advertisers over those 16 years across
[01:31:11.600 --> 01:31:16.960]   a range of product categories is that if ads and podcasts are going to work for a brand
[01:31:16.960 --> 01:31:23.680]   they're going to work on twit shows. I'm proud to say that the ads we do over deliver they work

[01:32:16.640 --> 01:32:24.640]   All right what else is going on in the world of apple anything. So we do confe a couple things
[01:32:24.640 --> 01:32:35.200]   we're left hanging. Apparently it is the case that the smallest hard drive on the new Mac mini
[01:32:35.200 --> 01:32:42.000]   and the MacBook Pros are in fact slower but they're still pretty fast.
[01:32:43.120 --> 01:32:51.040]   So I just don't think it matters. I think that you're not buying a 256. And I'm saying this as
[01:32:51.040 --> 01:32:59.600]   someone who bought the 256 8 8 gig one I don't care about the hard drive space. So it's not a
[01:32:59.600 --> 01:33:07.440]   real issue for me because a hard drive speed because I have a USB C on the if you're buying 256 gigs
[01:33:07.440 --> 01:33:13.120]   this is application and system software nothing else like that's what you're putting on it.
[01:33:13.120 --> 01:33:17.440]   The speed of it you're not writing video files to it you're not writing other things to it you're
[01:33:17.440 --> 01:33:22.000]   using it as a node you're bringing that in. So I think that that's the real issue. I don't and
[01:33:22.000 --> 01:33:26.400]   again as someone who bought it knowing that it would be slower doesn't I don't think it matters.
[01:33:26.400 --> 01:33:30.960]   And so I think that's apparently it's because it uses a single man chip.
[01:33:32.160 --> 01:33:38.560]   And so it's like rate if you have two you can stripe or something I guess. I would have liked
[01:33:38.560 --> 01:33:42.800]   them to disclose this just because even though I do think that you know everybody's making a big
[01:33:42.800 --> 01:33:47.360]   deal out of this and it's actually not that impressive and not that important in terms of
[01:33:47.360 --> 01:33:52.240]   your regular user and the people who are buying these configurations not disclosing it feels like
[01:33:52.240 --> 01:33:57.360]   they're trying to get away with something. However I do wonder if they are not disclosing it because
[01:33:58.080 --> 01:34:03.520]   of pure production issues which is what if they decide at any point in the process that they can
[01:34:03.520 --> 01:34:10.640]   get their hands on more 128 chips than 256 chips and they start manufacturing some of them with two
[01:34:10.640 --> 01:34:16.640]   128 instead of one two three. Then those would be faster but it would be completely unlabeled and
[01:34:16.640 --> 01:34:23.680]   like there is at some point down in the stack you were down at supply chain configuration details
[01:34:23.680 --> 01:34:29.440]   that the manufacturer doesn't want to talk about. And however Apple is so scrutinized and the fact
[01:34:29.440 --> 01:34:34.640]   is that there is a tangible difference even if it isn't super relevant that it would have been nice.
[01:34:34.640 --> 01:34:39.200]   I mean honestly it fits into the whole idea right you pay more to get more this is these are on the
[01:34:39.200 --> 01:34:44.960]   lowest end systems so they could disclaim it and say you know these may be slower you know this one's
[01:34:44.960 --> 01:34:50.800]   good but that one is great and do it that way and I just more disclosure if your Apple I think
[01:34:50.800 --> 01:34:55.600]   is a good thing but this is also people are making a way bigger deal of this than they should.
[01:34:55.600 --> 01:35:03.120]   Yeah it's silly. So 256 just go one step up if you're buying a mini if you're buying a MacBook
[01:35:03.120 --> 01:35:09.440]   Pro go one step up from the 512 and you'll get the faster speeds this is the Blackmagic Disc Read
[01:35:09.440 --> 01:35:16.080]   Test this is from 9 to 5 Mac on the left the M1 MacBook Pro on the right the M2 MacBook Pro
[01:35:16.080 --> 01:35:23.760]   you see it's a little slower than the M1 oh gosh it's only three gigabytes a second oh golly gosh
[01:35:23.760 --> 01:35:29.840]   fine I don't think it makes that much of a difference it's pretty darn fast but yeah and as
[01:35:29.840 --> 01:35:34.960]   and you're the one who told us Alex that if you are going to use you know edit video or whatever
[01:35:34.960 --> 01:35:40.720]   get a lot of on board drive because that's yeah I mean the fastest drive faster than a
[01:35:40.720 --> 01:35:46.240]   Thunderbolt 4 external drive the fastest drive you get yeah the only one that is the only thing
[01:35:46.240 --> 01:35:52.400]   that matches it is the iodine.io Iodine makes an external drive that uses two thunderbolts oh
[01:35:52.400 --> 01:35:56.960]   interesting into your into your computer I'm hoping to test it sometime in the near future but
[01:35:56.960 --> 01:36:06.880]   but the but I haven't tested it but it's it should do five gigs a second read in about 1.8 right
[01:36:06.880 --> 01:36:11.120]   which is which would be about similar to the to the internal one so that's the only option
[01:36:11.120 --> 01:36:17.040]   if you're not going to get the into get more storage on your on your studio yeah and it's
[01:36:17.040 --> 01:36:23.440]   if you're doing what I was doing which was what I do is six channels of 6k Blackmagic Raw and
[01:36:23.440 --> 01:36:28.720]   Resolve I haven't found anything under about five gigs a second that will play that back smoothly
[01:36:28.720 --> 01:36:35.520]   so that's the yeah that's the challenge yeah there has long been a cold war between Apple and
[01:36:35.520 --> 01:36:42.080]   Google over phones Steve Jobs basically said the Google Android operating system was a stolen
[01:36:42.080 --> 01:36:51.440]   product that copied iOS Steve declared thermonuclear war literally he used that term against Google
[01:36:51.440 --> 01:36:58.240]   you know that war that cold war has cooled off quite a bit but interesting article for
[01:36:58.240 --> 01:37:04.560]   financial times repeated in the Ars Technica about Apple beefing up its smartphone services
[01:37:04.560 --> 01:37:10.080]   to gradually compete more and more with Google they don't like it the people use Google Maps on
[01:37:10.080 --> 01:37:17.280]   an iPhone or Google search on Safari so they are slowly improving their services so that you won't
[01:37:17.280 --> 01:37:24.480]   improving Google or Apple Maps so you don't use Google Maps business connect which Apple announced
[01:37:24.480 --> 01:37:29.440]   earlier this month feature the let's companies claim their digital location much like Google
[01:37:29.440 --> 01:37:36.720]   business does that's a new feature I have to say that I when I got my new phone I just kind of let
[01:37:36.720 --> 01:37:40.800]   it be Apple Maps for a little while because I always use Google Maps up until you know when I got
[01:37:40.800 --> 01:37:45.040]   this in the last phone and I just was like I'm just gonna live in the Apple Maps world for a while
[01:37:45.040 --> 01:37:49.360]   and then a week ago I put Google Maps on for some you know just just okay now what it feels like
[01:37:49.360 --> 01:37:55.200]   and I actually need to say but I actually like the Apple Maps better now I mean it's they've
[01:37:55.200 --> 01:38:00.560]   actually the just the way it obviously it's tied into the OS it makes it a little easier to work with
[01:38:00.560 --> 01:38:06.800]   but also I just find it more visually pleasing you know than what I was you know than Google Maps
[01:38:06.800 --> 01:38:12.880]   and it's a little bit more responsive it's just as accurate as Google Maps I mean I don't find that's
[01:38:12.880 --> 01:38:17.600]   they fixed the accuracy if we're less accurate you wouldn't use it but as long as the that's the
[01:38:17.600 --> 01:38:22.400]   feature is the same then choose the one you like right exactly and I think that you know I think
[01:38:22.400 --> 01:38:26.240]   that right now the numbers the last number I saw was like 60 65 percent of the somewhere
[01:38:26.240 --> 01:38:31.440]   between 60 65 percent of iPhone users use Apple Maps because it comes with it it comes
[01:38:31.440 --> 01:38:36.160]   yeah well it well it goes on my watch for instance so you know I mean when I'm driving I don't have
[01:38:36.160 --> 01:38:40.720]   to look at the map the watch tells me turn left or I'm walking I can look at my watch there's a lot
[01:38:40.720 --> 01:38:47.440]   of little things that add up to supremacy if you're on an Apple device and that's kind of what Apple's
[01:38:47.440 --> 01:38:54.240]   doing they still use of course Google search on Safari and Google pays them a lot of money for
[01:38:54.240 --> 01:38:58.400]   that perhaps they're not willing to give up that money but also what are they what else they're
[01:38:58.400 --> 01:39:02.400]   gonna use I don't think it's about them I don't think it's about the money I think it's just about
[01:39:02.400 --> 01:39:05.680]   building a search engine is hard you know like building a good search engine and I don't I don't
[01:39:05.680 --> 01:39:09.280]   think Apple has I mean it's nice that they get the money but I don't think Apple's investing in
[01:39:09.280 --> 01:39:14.160]   maybe they are I mean with Siri they're probably working on search tools but but I think that that's
[01:39:14.160 --> 01:39:19.440]   a that is such a I mean Google has that so wired in I don't that would be very it'd be almost impossible
[01:39:19.440 --> 01:39:24.640]   for Apple to achieve parity with with Google search yeah according to this article from the
[01:39:24.640 --> 01:39:31.600]   Financial Times Apple did acquire in 2013 something called Topsy Labs a startup that index twitter
[01:39:31.600 --> 01:39:35.840]   it enables searches and analytics they say that's really the beginning of an Apple search
[01:39:35.840 --> 01:39:42.800]   team in fact you use Topsy every time you ask Siri for information well that's not a very good
[01:39:42.800 --> 01:39:48.800]   good foundation yeah they're never mind that they also in 2019 bought a company called Laser
[01:39:48.800 --> 01:39:53.520]   Like this I did not know about an artificial intelligence startup founded by former Google
[01:39:53.520 --> 01:39:59.520]   engineers that said its mission is delivering high quality information and diverse perspectives
[01:39:59.520 --> 01:40:06.560]   on any topic from the entire web that sounds sort of like a search engine yeah it could be the it
[01:40:06.560 --> 01:40:11.520]   could be that Apple's isn't necessarily interested in taking over search from Google but every time
[01:40:11.520 --> 01:40:15.920]   that you type into the search box something that Apple thinks that it could handle itself without
[01:40:15.920 --> 01:40:21.440]   farming it out to Google without necessarily giving it the benefit of its user data I think of them
[01:40:21.440 --> 01:40:26.800]   that's when a private Apple search engine rules will start to kick in and it makes sense spotlight
[01:40:26.800 --> 01:40:33.440]   makes the entire system like 10 times better I mean I don't I'm to this day I'm not really sure
[01:40:33.440 --> 01:40:38.000]   how app launchers work on the Mac because I still just use spotlight to launch everything that I
[01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:43.680]   need to access so that having that integrated right into the desktop with a command space every
[01:40:43.680 --> 01:40:48.720]   every time I go that would be a nice value but that would happen necessarily go through Google
[01:40:48.720 --> 01:40:53.840]   and let's not forget Google we don't know neither Google nor Apple discloses but it's estimated
[01:40:53.840 --> 01:41:00.320]   Google between pays Apple yeah between eight and 12 billion a year for the privilege of being the
[01:41:00.320 --> 01:41:04.560]   official search engine on Safari that drives a lot and it means Google makes more than that
[01:41:05.200 --> 01:41:12.160]   from the other referrals so but that might be ending too because part of part of what the
[01:41:12.160 --> 01:41:18.720]   but the DOJ is is on to on Google against is basically cutting these exclusive deals with
[01:41:18.720 --> 01:41:23.520]   companies like Apple to basically be the number of the default search engine on as many platforms
[01:41:23.520 --> 01:41:28.880]   as possible so it's possible that they they could get Microsoft did where Google doesn't necessarily
[01:41:28.880 --> 01:41:33.360]   have to break things up they don't necessarily have to divest anything but they can no longer
[01:41:34.080 --> 01:41:38.560]   access some of its most lucrative tricks and most lucrative deals anymore and that would create a
[01:41:38.560 --> 01:41:42.160]   great opening for either another company or for Apple's own search product.
[01:41:42.160 --> 01:41:50.160]   Apple has extended Chinese censorship to Hong Kong now and I'm sure this is at the
[01:41:50.160 --> 01:41:56.320]   behest of the Chinese government which has been slowly closing the news in on Hong Kong.
[01:41:56.320 --> 01:42:03.360]   Hong Kong Apple users say Safari briefly blocked GitLab because it's backed by 10 cent.
[01:42:04.240 --> 01:42:07.680]   Safari aims to protect users from websites that may contain malware.
[01:42:07.680 --> 01:42:20.880]   Yeah it's hot me Hong Kong is contentious where it's China but not China and so when you start to
[01:42:20.880 --> 01:42:25.200]   basically say that we will start to use the same blacklist that we use for mainland China
[01:42:25.200 --> 01:42:32.240]   in Hong Kong that is a step and that could be a provocation so I see what GitLab's not on by
[01:42:32.240 --> 01:42:38.880]   10 cent but they use the index that 10 cent has the block list to block it 10 cent put GitLab
[01:42:38.880 --> 01:42:43.520]   on the block list because it quote contains misinformation which I don't think is the case
[01:42:43.520 --> 01:42:51.040]   it might contain VPN software it's another Git it's like GitHub yeah so interesting
[01:42:51.040 --> 01:43:00.320]   I mean given that given that China has been walking back the deal they made when
[01:43:01.200 --> 01:43:05.520]   and the British left Hong Kong it's basically say that yeah it's going to be it's going to
[01:43:05.520 --> 01:43:12.240]   belong to China but Hong Kong will have a special a special sort of autonomy that won't be available
[01:43:12.240 --> 01:43:16.400]   to other cities in China and they've been walking that back steadily over the past five, six,
[01:43:16.400 --> 01:43:23.360]   seven years this is this for for Hong Kong activists this is a this is sad news bad news and
[01:43:23.360 --> 01:43:30.480]   reason for activism. According to the intercept Apple has been using the 10 cent blacklist on
[01:43:30.480 --> 01:43:38.880]   devices registered in Hong Kong but Apple removed the block on GitLab GitLab access was
[01:43:38.880 --> 01:43:46.560]   subsequently restored Apple has not officially commented in fact Apple when the intercept asked
[01:43:46.560 --> 01:43:53.920]   referred them to 10 cent which is a kind of a tacit acknowledgement that there's not at all shady
[01:43:54.880 --> 01:44:00.560]   all right let's let's take a little break and we're going to come back with your picks of the week
[01:44:00.560 --> 01:44:07.600]   our show today brought to you in great part by our great club twit members club twit
[01:44:07.600 --> 01:44:14.400]   we switch Lisa started almost two years ago has grown greatly we really appreciate it but we still
[01:44:14.400 --> 01:44:20.080]   have a long way to go to get to our goal of five percent of our audience that's all right now it's
[01:44:20.080 --> 01:44:25.680]   less than 1% we'd love to get to 5% of our audience that would mean that 5% of our audience was paying
[01:44:25.680 --> 01:44:31.360]   seven bucks a month to support what we do to help bring you shows to help us develop new shows and
[01:44:31.360 --> 01:44:35.440]   for and what do you get for your seven bucks a month add free versions of everything we do
[01:44:35.440 --> 01:44:41.200]   shows we don't put out all swear like hands on Macintosh my cusargence great show or
[01:44:41.200 --> 01:44:46.320]   hands on windows by Paul Thorett the untitled Linux show with Jonathan Bennett the Giz whiz
[01:44:46.320 --> 01:44:51.920]   or sorry I should say the Giz fizz with Dick D Bartolo we launched this week in space in the club thanks
[01:44:51.920 --> 01:44:56.240]   to club members and of course now it's a show that we do put out for everybody that's the goal
[01:44:56.240 --> 01:45:01.200]   but when a show is new and it can't generate revenue on its own the club twit members support it and
[01:45:01.200 --> 01:45:05.760]   we really appreciate that you also get and I don't think this should be diminished in any way because
[01:45:05.760 --> 01:45:10.720]   I think it's probably part of the best part of club twit access to our special discord our members
[01:45:10.720 --> 01:45:17.120]   only discord which besides being full of animated gifts is actually a great place to hang out with
[01:45:17.120 --> 01:45:24.240]   geeks talking about not just our shows but everything other geeks are interested in from anime to
[01:45:24.240 --> 01:45:33.280]   autos fitness and gaming yes we talk about sports and ham radio and sci-fi and science I spent a
[01:45:33.280 --> 01:45:38.240]   lot of time in the coding channel over there a lot of great talented coders we love to talk
[01:45:38.240 --> 01:45:41.920]   I love to ask for help there's just a lot of reasons why you might want to
[01:45:41.920 --> 01:45:46.000]   listen to captain James T Kirk and join us
[01:45:46.000 --> 01:45:58.000]   all you have to do go to twit.tv/club twit twit.tv/club twit $7 a month $84 a year there are corporate
[01:45:58.000 --> 01:46:04.160]   memberships as well but we really appreciate all of our club twit members they're great people
[01:46:04.880 --> 01:46:08.000]   they've really helped us out a lot we would love you to join the group
[01:46:08.000 --> 01:46:12.400]   it's a lot of fun thank you Jason Stel for that Jeff
[01:46:12.400 --> 01:46:19.040]   science I was on I was on this week in space this week in space you were what were you talking
[01:46:19.040 --> 01:46:23.280]   about it was fun we talked about favorite books and fiction and nonfiction about space
[01:46:23.280 --> 01:46:28.480]   which was a really good really good conversation I used to do a space podcast and I haven't done
[01:46:28.480 --> 01:46:32.880]   one for we will only do it every occasionally now and so it was kind of fun to be on a space
[01:46:32.880 --> 01:46:38.560]   podcast yeah Rod Pyle who's fantastic from those guys know their stuff wow very fast
[01:46:38.560 --> 01:46:44.720]   real fans Rod worked at PR at JPL he's now editor in chief for at Astra which is the
[01:46:44.720 --> 01:46:51.920]   official publication of the national space society and Tarek Malek from editor space.com
[01:46:51.920 --> 01:46:56.080]   so it's really too high powered who really do I mean this is what they do for a living as
[01:46:56.080 --> 01:47:00.160]   they cover space and so it makes it a great show we are going to be adding video to that
[01:47:00.160 --> 01:47:05.600]   soon I think so that was a good example of what what happens we did ours this video so I think
[01:47:05.600 --> 01:47:11.120]   it's in the works okay it's in the works oh yeah they always use video and that's why it won't be
[01:47:11.120 --> 01:47:16.640]   so hard for us to turn the switch put out a video podcast we've always used to see each other and
[01:47:16.640 --> 01:47:22.240]   see their guests coming up by the way Daniel Suarez will be on this week in space he is a
[01:47:22.240 --> 01:47:25.600]   of course the author of demon and freedom and we're going to do an interview about his new book
[01:47:25.600 --> 01:47:31.760]   which just came out today very excited critical mass which is a follow up to delta v
[01:47:31.760 --> 01:47:38.720]   Daniel is one of my favorite sci-fi authors and he's also a space fanatic and a real promoter of
[01:47:38.720 --> 01:47:42.640]   why we should be going in manned space missions and so he wanted to get on this week in space
[01:47:42.640 --> 01:47:47.440]   and talk about Mars and talk about manned space missions so and then Daniel will join us February
[01:47:47.440 --> 01:47:51.920]   10th for a special triangulation and there will be a club aspect to that club members will get
[01:47:51.920 --> 01:47:57.200]   to ask him questions directly we'll have a feed into the club with me record that so that's going
[01:47:57.200 --> 01:48:03.040]   to be a lot of fun I don't want to be the language police Leo but we call him crude space missions
[01:48:03.040 --> 01:48:09.680]   now not man yes oh I guess you're right it should be crude shouldn't it yeah that NASA changed that
[01:48:09.680 --> 01:48:16.800]   a problem I think it was actually a while ago you spell it CROD or CRUD you can spell it however
[01:48:16.800 --> 01:48:23.520]   you want but I think it's E.W.E.D. is what it's supposed to be yeah all right gosh right thank you I
[01:48:23.520 --> 01:48:29.200]   stand corrected human space flight humans yes but even that's got a man in it crude is good well I
[01:48:29.200 --> 01:48:34.080]   mean yeah except for the hominem language is a problem yeah it is it's a big problem but that is
[01:48:34.080 --> 01:48:37.840]   what NASA calls it that's what what books did you yeah no that's good thank you for correcting me I
[01:48:37.840 --> 01:48:43.680]   will use that for now what books did you recommend oh man there's there's so many good books like I
[01:48:43.680 --> 01:48:49.200]   recommended a bunch like there's like the the Apollo mission book that was the basis for from
[01:48:49.200 --> 01:48:54.000]   the earth to the moon oh yes so it called a man on the moon by Andy Chakin yeah there's a book
[01:48:54.000 --> 01:48:58.720]   called Bringing Columbia Home which is it's it's kind of dark but it's also kind of beautiful it's
[01:48:58.720 --> 01:49:04.480]   about the people who were tasked with picking up all the wreckage and remains yikes after Columbia
[01:49:04.480 --> 01:49:12.080]   crashed in Texas and Louisiana and the people who volunteered to do that and the sort of emotional
[01:49:12.080 --> 01:49:16.560]   toll but also why it was important it's so good and then there was a book I wish I could remember
[01:49:16.560 --> 01:49:22.080]   the name but there's a book by it's about the first spatial mission which when I watched it as a kid
[01:49:22.080 --> 01:49:29.680]   it went off without a without a hitch ha ha ha the book reveals it went off with so many hitches
[01:49:29.680 --> 01:49:35.440]   they had to use a secret spy satellite there's some cloak and dagger stuff in there where where
[01:49:35.440 --> 01:49:39.680]   they couldn't get access to the spy satellite photos because that it was the existence of the
[01:49:39.680 --> 01:49:47.280]   satellite was classified wow but they but they did and it was like a man who will not be named
[01:49:47.280 --> 01:49:52.720]   entered an empty room and placed an envelope on a table and then would not leave until the envelope
[01:49:52.720 --> 01:49:58.240]   was back in his hands but he allowed them to look at the pictures just some great great stories
[01:49:58.240 --> 01:50:03.040]   about that too so it's people should check it out that I'm trying to look up what that book is but
[01:50:03.040 --> 01:50:08.160]   well you know what the best way to do this listen to the latest episode of this week in space that's
[01:50:08.160 --> 01:50:13.120]   the way to do it twit.tv/twist and we might in fact have those links in the show based into the
[01:50:13.120 --> 01:50:18.880]   discord too I want to see it yeah yeah it sounds really good time for our picks of the week
[01:50:18.880 --> 01:50:23.840]   uh I don't usually do a pick of the week but this was and it's kind of a minor pick of the week but
[01:50:23.840 --> 01:50:31.680]   I thought this was really cool these are SVG icons that were extracted from the 30th anniversary
[01:50:31.680 --> 01:50:39.120]   mac font so because of the date of the font it doesn't go past 19 what is what is the most recent
[01:50:39.120 --> 01:50:47.120]   one 2012 uh they oh actually they have the trash can mac although that is not a great icon it's just
[01:50:47.120 --> 01:50:52.560]   basically routed corner square I could have done that yeah but there wasn't much to say about the
[01:50:52.560 --> 01:51:00.560]   trash can mac I guess but these are pretty cool you can download them there for free uh rniteuk.gov.io
[01:51:00.560 --> 01:51:04.880]   but I have a we'll put a link in the show notes you could also google mac 30th anniversary
[01:51:04.880 --> 01:51:12.480]   icons by rob night all artwork owned by apple but you know what on the 40th anniversary of the
[01:51:12.480 --> 01:51:23.840]   macintosh XL which looks a lot like a lisa that the the uh 2cx the two fx two fing expensive
[01:51:24.480 --> 01:51:30.080]   and uh and uh some others some of these were really ugly some of them were just not
[01:51:30.080 --> 01:51:35.440]   felicitous designs yeah but they're all those are the days that's when the india and i were working
[01:51:35.440 --> 01:51:40.800]   in uh knacchia's or magazine and apple is coming up with a increasingly ugly series of computers
[01:51:40.800 --> 01:51:47.040]   there there there was a lot of wandering in the desert like between frog design and man 97
[01:51:47.040 --> 01:51:53.760]   90s apple was so weird oh boy yeah yeah yeah there's the 90s oog you know the i can'ts really
[01:51:53.760 --> 01:52:00.560]   power mac with a giant forehead that was like oh the pull to the pull tooth uh g3 the molar mac
[01:52:00.560 --> 01:52:06.880]   the molar mac yeah absolutely wow you guys even had nicknames for them oh yeah loving loving
[01:52:06.880 --> 01:52:13.920]   nicknames because we love the design which was the pull tooth this one the color classic it's
[01:52:13.920 --> 01:52:21.440]   it's no it's the power macintosh g3 all in one oh god uh which was like a predecessor to the iMac
[01:52:21.440 --> 01:52:28.960]   and in fact it was designed by johnny ive and it's got it's got some very weird the rumor is that
[01:52:28.960 --> 01:52:35.120]   the curve on the top of the of the box because it's an all-in-one so it's got a monitor in it yeah but
[01:52:35.120 --> 01:52:43.840]   so CRT um was based on the on johnny ives girlfriend's back uh oh geez wait uh but it was it was it had
[01:52:43.840 --> 01:52:49.840]   a little translucent plastic the most it was a beautiful bag it's a perfect perfect curve anyway
[01:52:49.840 --> 01:52:56.080]   it has translucent plastic on it you can see johnny i've crying for help trying to get out of 90s apple
[01:52:56.080 --> 01:53:02.720]   um but the the computer itself yeah it looks like a big pull tooth it's booh oh oh i get it's not
[01:53:02.720 --> 01:53:08.400]   that it's missing a tooth in the front of it oh right it looks like a pulled no it's a molar yeah it's
[01:53:08.400 --> 01:53:14.560]   yeah it's a molar it's a molar mac oh because it had the creamy white color there's that molar
[01:53:14.560 --> 01:53:20.720]   how ugly i never saw this i don't think oh it's so bad that is really hideous
[01:53:20.720 --> 01:53:24.800]   it does look like johnny ives back though on the top there that's true
[01:53:26.400 --> 01:53:32.400]   her scapulas her prominent scapulas inspired me to design this ugly mac
[01:53:32.400 --> 01:53:40.800]   jesus uh anyway that's my pick how about yours jason and sinell all right i wanted to pick uh
[01:53:40.800 --> 01:53:44.880]   i'm gonna get a little nerdy here but it's codeless nerdy so it's actually if you're somebody who
[01:53:44.880 --> 01:53:50.000]   fancies yourself a power user but you're not necessarily comfortable being a programmer uh this
[01:53:50.000 --> 01:53:56.720]   is a web app that i love um it does cost it's free to try and then depending on how much of it you use
[01:53:56.720 --> 01:54:02.640]   you can pay i think i'm paying like ten dollars a month for it but it's it's a make.com formerly
[01:54:02.640 --> 01:54:09.680]   called integramat i wonder why they changed its name integramat perfect for the g3 power macotch
[01:54:09.680 --> 01:54:14.640]   yeah so it made enough money to buy make.com make.com it is it is yeah it's codeless
[01:54:14.640 --> 01:54:19.680]   make.com used to be a riley's magazine recipes i think when the magazine went out of business they
[01:54:19.680 --> 01:54:25.440]   snagged these yeah yeah something like that so so it's a little like if this then that um it's that
[01:54:25.440 --> 01:54:30.960]   kind of thing it is codeless. It's a total. Web web recipes little blobs that you connect together
[01:54:30.960 --> 01:54:38.000]   that will let you do anything so what am i doing with this i have a bot that posts to my uh
[01:54:38.000 --> 01:54:43.920]   incomparable members when we're about to start a live stream uh i have a bot that posts uh the
[01:54:43.920 --> 01:54:49.280]   new episodes of my podcast to twitter and mast it on i know that somebody i think one of the big
[01:54:49.280 --> 01:54:55.600]   social media sites just added support for mastodon it's like i i built my mastodon bot like two
[01:54:55.600 --> 01:55:00.880]   weeks ago in make.com so do you have to run it in the background or does it web host? no no you
[01:55:00.880 --> 01:55:05.840]   set it up to run and it'll do things like watch an rss feed or wait for a tweet so your mac has to
[01:55:05.840 --> 01:55:11.280]   stay on to do that though right no no no it's it's a web app so it's running in the cloud so you
[01:55:11.280 --> 01:55:17.760]   just build them on your mac and then it runs in the cloud back or pc or ipad or whatever and it runs
[01:55:17.760 --> 01:55:22.480]   in the cloud so i've got it doing all sorts of stuff like this so it's like zappier or if this
[01:55:22.480 --> 01:55:28.640]   than that but it's got a really nice user interface it's really good and it has a level of i mean
[01:55:28.640 --> 01:55:33.760]   all of those there is an expert mode where you can get really get your hands dirty but i was very
[01:55:33.760 --> 01:55:40.240]   impressed at how easy some of the expert stuff actually works in make.com and i always look at the
[01:55:40.240 --> 01:55:44.560]   integrations because i want to know well what can i interface with this actually looks like it has a
[01:55:44.560 --> 01:55:52.720]   very complete set 1,380 integrations that you can including mastodon which is nice plus web hook
[01:55:52.720 --> 01:55:59.840]   and http which will get you literally anything on the web nice so yeah it's really good wow wow
[01:55:59.840 --> 01:56:04.480]   this is great and you can try for you can start for free and then if you want to use a lot you pay
[01:56:04.480 --> 01:56:09.280]   they were a sponsor but i paid for them for years i also pay for if this than that because they
[01:56:09.280 --> 01:56:14.800]   stop being free maybe i should cancel those and just go to this see if it works for you i i love it
[01:56:14.800 --> 01:56:20.560]   i think it's really good i have a lot of scripts we use a ton of scripts on zappier huh i really
[01:56:20.560 --> 01:56:25.920]   think that the the no code low code revolution is coming it's coming you know like you're seeing all
[01:56:25.920 --> 01:56:32.640]   these things pop in i really think that it's a huge there's a huge gap between um that shortcuts and
[01:56:32.640 --> 01:56:37.440]   and swift playgrounds that wants to be filled with some kind of nodal right um you know solution
[01:56:37.440 --> 01:56:42.240]   but i think that while between now and then whenever that happens i think that all of these
[01:56:42.240 --> 01:56:46.560]   these no code low code just let you let people who are just have something they need to get done
[01:56:46.560 --> 01:56:51.040]   and don't want to learn how to build don't want to learn not to do coding structures um you know
[01:56:51.040 --> 01:56:57.360]   let them put stuff together it's pretty exciting yeah i agree all right thank you for the recommendation
[01:56:57.360 --> 01:57:06.160]   make dot com mr. Andy and i co how about you what you got for us i got two free apps that i really
[01:57:06.160 --> 01:57:10.080]   really love they're both by developer brother name of rafiel khandi and they're the exact
[01:57:10.080 --> 01:57:15.280]   they're exactly the sort of apps that i love to find and i love to recommend because they do like
[01:57:15.280 --> 01:57:20.880]   one thing that is really really useful and they do it really really beautifully uh the first app is
[01:57:20.880 --> 01:57:29.360]   called hi doc and it all it does is you know the doc has only one setting but and ignores the fact
[01:57:29.360 --> 01:57:33.760]   that sometimes you have your your your macbook and then sometimes you take your macbook home you've
[01:57:33.760 --> 01:57:37.840]   got to plugged into an external display and you've got two displays sometimes you might have it
[01:57:37.840 --> 01:57:42.000]   hooked up to an external display and you're not using the main display hi doc will simply let
[01:57:42.000 --> 01:57:47.680]   you define look when it's just the built-in display for instance i want i want the doc to be visible
[01:57:47.680 --> 01:57:52.880]   but at the bottom if i'm just using the external display i want it off to the left side but i want
[01:57:52.880 --> 01:57:57.120]   the i want the icons to be really really big if i'm using both of them i want to i'll be off to the
[01:57:57.120 --> 01:58:01.120]   right and i want them really really tiny and it will just do that switch for you automatically
[01:58:01.120 --> 01:58:05.040]   depending on again do you have just built-in display the external display or do you have
[01:58:05.040 --> 01:58:10.640]   multiple displays going in uh and it it's it's just an app you don't need to like uh install extensions
[01:58:10.640 --> 01:58:14.960]   you don't need to corrupt your system or anything like that it just plain works and there's also a
[01:58:14.960 --> 01:58:19.040]   menu list so that if you want to trigger these things through the menu bar you can do that as well
[01:58:19.040 --> 01:58:24.640]   and it works really really great uh and it's uh and it's this one is free the other one uh is
[01:58:24.640 --> 01:58:29.680]   again it's the dumbest thing and you think that okay well who would use this until you've got this
[01:58:29.680 --> 01:58:34.480]   on your menu bar and then you i find myself using it it's called hand mirror and it puts an icon of a
[01:58:34.480 --> 01:58:39.120]   hand mirror in your menu bar and all it does when you click on it is that it activates your selected
[01:58:39.120 --> 01:58:43.120]   camera and lets you take a look at yourself to check to make sure that your hair is okay before
[01:58:43.120 --> 01:58:48.720]   you go on a chat or to check your camera before you go on a chat uh and for that feature it's
[01:58:48.720 --> 01:58:53.520]   absolutely free and again it's so useful because i used to have to like i used to like launch a
[01:58:53.520 --> 01:58:57.440]   different app when i wanted to do that like i want to check make sure that my lining is okay that
[01:58:57.440 --> 01:59:01.520]   i'm framed okay before i do a chat and now i just have this thing that just click it and it puts
[01:59:01.520 --> 01:59:08.000]   this little pop up up uh as a matter of fact if you if you spend five bucks for the uh uh uh for the
[01:59:08.000 --> 01:59:13.760]   for the h uh hand mirror plus uh the hot zone to activate it can also be the notch in your brand
[01:59:13.760 --> 01:59:20.800]   new macbook oh i like that i like that um and and it also if you go for the uh for the plus version
[01:59:20.800 --> 01:59:25.200]   it's also very useful for let's say that you're eating a chat app that doesn't let you basically
[01:59:25.200 --> 01:59:29.600]   see yourself while you're very easily while you're in that chat you can have this thing
[01:59:29.600 --> 01:59:34.800]   whatever size you want whatever shape window you want uh conceivably you could do it if you want to
[01:59:34.800 --> 01:59:38.960]   do like a live stream and you're basically capturing uh the video that's coming out of your mac
[01:59:38.960 --> 01:59:44.640]   so now basically you have your own inset window whatever size and shape you want wherever you want
[01:59:44.640 --> 01:59:49.040]   it on the screen it'll make you right there nice yeah and so it'll be and so it'll just be
[01:59:49.040 --> 01:59:54.160]   over it'll be overlaid on on whatever you do uh but the free version is again useful enough when you
[01:59:54.160 --> 01:59:59.600]   just want to know okay do i have i have i adjusted the partition enough so that they can't see the
[01:59:59.600 --> 02:00:04.720]   cardboard boxes just behind it of all the all the clothes i'm supposed to be donating to to to
[02:00:04.720 --> 02:00:10.240]   good will i always like to make the gear look like a halo when i'm doing the show so yeah i want that
[02:00:10.240 --> 02:00:16.640]   yeah you know it's weird i'm doing this on linux but they simulate well macintosh by putting a fake
[02:00:16.640 --> 02:00:22.240]   mac menu up there and i tap it and it actually works i had to give permission everything i know
[02:00:22.240 --> 02:00:29.280]   isn't that hysterical works on linux well only the website does uh i love it that you can finally
[02:00:29.280 --> 02:00:33.440]   do something with the notch so you mean if you move your mouse into the notch it will it will
[02:00:33.440 --> 02:00:37.760]   activate it i don't i don't have one so i can't try i believe that if you move your mouse into the
[02:00:37.760 --> 02:00:43.840]   notch area and click that activates the hand mirror i'm glad that we can obviously and specific and
[02:00:43.840 --> 02:00:48.720]   specifically the selfie camera that's inside that thing um it doesn't say it doesn't see the UI i
[02:00:48.720 --> 02:00:52.560]   i haven't installed the UI doesn't seem to let you choose specifically what camera you're so i
[02:00:52.560 --> 02:00:58.000]   couldn't use other cameras but well i don't know i mean it seems to whenever i use it it uses
[02:00:58.000 --> 02:01:02.880]   whatever the selected camera is oh whatever the active camera is like that i'm using right now so
[02:01:02.880 --> 02:01:10.000]   he says why not use photo booth he says that's exactly what i was doing but sometimes it would
[02:01:10.000 --> 02:01:15.200]   open photos by accident or i'd open photo booth so much that if i type "vote" in spotlight would
[02:01:15.200 --> 02:01:21.040]   have good default the photo booth and that's not what i want so you know that's a good reason to
[02:01:21.040 --> 02:01:27.120]   write an app that's a simple good reason to write an app yep and both of those things like again a
[02:01:27.120 --> 02:01:33.360]   hand mirror plus is five bucks uh for for for high doc it's free free free in the in the in the
[02:01:33.360 --> 02:01:38.880]   in the webpage for it uh he just says oh if you really want to pay for it well want by by hand mirror
[02:01:38.880 --> 02:01:43.280]   because i've got actually something paid for that instead of just donating money uh so it's it's
[02:01:43.280 --> 02:01:47.920]   great stuff again not only is it just simply useful but it is a beautifully done beautifully
[02:01:47.920 --> 02:01:52.880]   done little charm bracelet like mac apps that i really really love he writes a lot of apps i love
[02:01:52.880 --> 02:02:00.000]   his website if you go to rafa.design let me refresh this so you can you can see it he uh he appears
[02:02:00.000 --> 02:02:09.280]   the website and gestures and stuff that's cool rafel candy nice then when you when you scroll like
[02:02:09.280 --> 02:02:14.240]   of course everything gets great out in his name except for rafa so it's like oh man why isn't my
[02:02:14.240 --> 02:02:19.520]   blog like wow and why that's cool is this this is this is somebody knows what he's doing here
[02:02:19.520 --> 02:02:26.080]   yeah the old css department if you know what i mean apparently also has well i won't talk about
[02:02:26.080 --> 02:02:32.080]   some of his other apps but yeah there's there are a couple that are got a little safe cracking app
[02:02:32.640 --> 02:02:41.520]   this guy's really cool this guy's really cool yeah uh rafa.design and the app is called hand mirror
[02:02:41.520 --> 02:02:49.200]   did he also do uh hi doc yep and hi doc he made both of these he's a very he's he likes to write
[02:02:49.200 --> 02:02:55.200]   small utilities i like that yep it's very useful Alex Lindsey take a little week time
[02:02:55.200 --> 02:03:01.360]   so we were talking about this earlier and i i don't um i i don't usually recommend books but
[02:03:01.360 --> 02:03:05.600]   but this one is really good this is this is we were talking about Rick Rubin in the past and i
[02:03:05.600 --> 02:03:09.680]   i downloaded the creative act a way of being which is the book that he was promoting i think to be on
[02:03:09.680 --> 02:03:15.440]   60 minutes you're really like why is he on 60 minutes because he has a new book um and i love
[02:03:15.440 --> 02:03:21.520]   this if you look at the link it is he has a audiobook a kindle book a hardcover and a spiral
[02:03:21.520 --> 02:03:29.600]   bound oh that's what i want good for him yeah so great anyway so um uh i'm about i'm about halfway
[02:03:29.600 --> 02:03:33.920]   through the book and i just have to say it's just really great like good enough that you know so i
[02:03:33.920 --> 02:03:39.680]   i listen to most of my books is just pure protein 2x um you know just just i just want to suck in
[02:03:39.680 --> 02:03:44.720]   all the information that's in the book because i don't really do fiction and um uh this one i
[02:03:44.720 --> 02:03:49.440]   slowed down i slowed i slowed it down to 1.5 and i was like oh it still feels a little rushed
[02:03:49.440 --> 02:03:53.760]   slowed down to 1.2 i was like i don't think i'm getting it and then i had to go down to one
[02:03:53.760 --> 02:03:58.800]   so i used to be at one it's not that he talks fast it's just that it just feels like you should be
[02:03:58.800 --> 02:04:04.880]   listening to this one at one x and just kind of you know just just sifting it in and and really um
[02:04:04.880 --> 02:04:09.280]   you know playing with it if you're thinking if you want to explore creativity because he's just
[02:04:09.280 --> 02:04:14.160]   talking about all people being honest all people being like a receiver for things not he's really
[02:04:14.160 --> 02:04:18.640]   talking about being a receiver of ideas not so much of creator i mean like your creator but you're
[02:04:18.640 --> 02:04:23.120]   funneling that through and and seeing how you're doing that and the good introduction to this book
[02:04:23.120 --> 02:04:27.760]   is to watch that 60 minutes which again i think is probably one of the top five 60 minutes
[02:04:27.760 --> 02:04:32.960]   60 minute segments um you know i used to watch it all the time haven't watched very much but i
[02:04:32.960 --> 02:04:38.560]   look at the subjects quickly um and uh and then they go no i'm not gonna watch that today um but
[02:04:38.560 --> 02:04:42.320]   every once in a while i see one that that i want to that i want to see and usually i'm disappointed
[02:04:42.320 --> 02:04:49.200]   this one was i felt like the 60 minutes was a great um you know a great 15 minutes with with
[02:04:49.200 --> 02:04:52.720]   Rick Rubin and got me excited about buying the book and then i bought the book and it was better
[02:04:52.720 --> 02:04:58.320]   than the than the 60 minutes so uh really really really great book i would highly recommend it
[02:04:58.320 --> 02:05:02.640]   yeah probably going to i'm probably going to end up sending to some friends
[02:05:02.640 --> 02:05:07.840]   yeah i'm thinking this would make a good valentine's day present for somebody in my life yeah
[02:05:07.840 --> 02:05:15.680]   yeah it's the only 60 minutes you interview you'll see that the interviewee gets the interviewer to
[02:05:15.680 --> 02:05:20.400]   meditate for a couple of minutes before the interview begins and then there's a group who does it and
[02:05:20.400 --> 02:05:26.080]   it's actually kind of cool and there's there's a point where where and as a cooper goes so what is
[02:05:26.080 --> 02:05:31.040]   you know do you know how to play instruments he's like no do you know how to use the the big mixer
[02:05:31.040 --> 02:05:35.600]   no i have no i have no i have no i because i can't i can't really seriously play anything i can't
[02:05:35.600 --> 02:05:40.240]   use any of the hardware or anything else and the thing that was so interesting about it is really
[02:05:40.240 --> 02:05:45.200]   just how he approaches this is i'm not trying to like you know fill specter was like i'm had a
[02:05:45.200 --> 02:05:50.640]   sound right the wall of sound and so on and so forth he's like everywhere like he's doing right
[02:05:50.640 --> 02:05:56.320]   he started in rap and then he's doing you know senegalese and and pop and everything else because
[02:05:56.320 --> 02:06:00.640]   he's just interested in the person expressing themselves and he's just listening he's listening
[02:06:00.640 --> 02:06:06.880]   for them not not for him and and and and his uh just it's just really really interesting and his
[02:06:06.880 --> 02:06:12.480]   book really digs into that a lot and it's he's very thin very inspiring yeah so it's a very inspiring
[02:06:12.480 --> 02:06:17.440]   book so it's well i can't wait to read it i just ordered it yeah that's uh that's great thank you
[02:06:17.440 --> 02:06:19.680]   so good you want to listen to it at one x
[02:06:19.680 --> 02:06:27.200]   set up that's what i'm there for for mounds Lindsay oh my god yes it's like it's the first book i've
[02:06:27.200 --> 02:06:31.440]   the first book i've i've listened to it one x since there was a way to speed it up in ottle
[02:06:31.440 --> 02:06:35.520]   like you know like as soon as i found that i was like i've been listening to cassettes since
[02:06:35.520 --> 02:06:39.840]   since the late 80s and and so i've been listening to books for a long long time and when i'm
[02:06:39.840 --> 02:06:45.120]   er audible i just saw this magic oh i could speed this up i could speed this up you know like you know
[02:06:45.120 --> 02:06:50.560]   i can't take it i don't it's i don't i it's i can't listen generally other than this book i cannot
[02:06:50.560 --> 02:06:55.120]   listen to it less than one point five because i get i get i think too many things in between right
[02:06:55.120 --> 02:07:01.120]   there's i just i literally i need i need it to be running it at speed or i can't stay with it otherwise
[02:07:01.120 --> 02:07:07.280]   i i my my mind wanders off because it's something it says then i go off to some squirrel you know yeah
[02:07:07.520 --> 02:07:15.120]   yeah lots of people listen to our shows at higher speeds in fact cajons of those people will come
[02:07:15.120 --> 02:07:18.000]   and listen to the show and in person and they'll say you all sound drunk
[02:07:18.000 --> 02:07:25.840]   say no we're just talking normally that's all Alex Lindsay office hours dot global is the place
[02:07:25.840 --> 02:07:33.520]   to go to see what's up constantly like literally constantly putting great stuff on the stream
[02:07:34.320 --> 02:07:38.960]   you can watch live you can participate in the zoom call but you got it all starts at office hours
[02:07:38.960 --> 02:07:45.280]   dot global time lapses today we're talking about time lapses and all the different ways of doing
[02:07:45.280 --> 02:07:49.760]   them and how to how to approach it and think about it so it's uh you know the day before we're
[02:07:49.760 --> 02:07:55.200]   talking about pricing like so we talk about business as well so some technical stuff also we were
[02:07:55.200 --> 02:08:00.080]   talking about space um in the gray matter dot show this is Michael Krasney show we had
[02:08:00.080 --> 02:08:04.560]   Vienna Tran talking about health in space you know and in the body how the body responds to
[02:08:04.560 --> 02:08:08.960]   space you know to to be in space for a long period of time so that's another another little
[02:08:08.960 --> 02:08:14.160]   hobby of mine i'm not a great matter dot show i have been on it is a great show

[02:08:58.560 --> 02:09:06.160]   six colors dot com slash Jason slash Jason gets you everything my writings at six colors and i link
[02:09:06.160 --> 02:09:13.840]   to podcasts and stuff and uh the incomparable for your podcast pop culture fix we got some great
[02:09:13.840 --> 02:09:20.320]   shows over there uh some friends of mine started a um last of us podcast uh watch a whole podcast
[02:09:20.320 --> 02:09:24.800]   that's uh going great what do you think of that show show based on a video game it's getting
[02:09:24.800 --> 02:09:29.280]   great reviews yeah it's really good it's Craig mason who did Chernobyl which was one of the very
[02:09:29.280 --> 02:09:33.920]   shows a couple of years ago yeah and who does the script notes podcast with john august he's a
[02:09:33.920 --> 02:09:39.200]   podcaster i knew him as a podcaster before i knew him that the guy who wrote Chernobyl and oh and
[02:09:39.200 --> 02:09:44.800]   uh and now the last of us so i confess i've been avoiding it because i'm not a fan of zombie
[02:09:44.800 --> 02:09:52.880]   the zombie genre i feel like it's it is i did you see station 11 no station 11 which is a as warm
[02:09:52.880 --> 02:09:59.680]   hearted an apocalypse show as you'll ever see miniseries the last of us is uh you know it is kind
[02:09:59.680 --> 02:10:03.920]   of like the walking dead but it's kind of filtered through a station 11 kind of lens it is more about
[02:10:03.920 --> 02:10:11.520]   the people than it is about the zombies and so um thus far through three episodes uh highly
[02:10:11.520 --> 02:10:15.920]   recommended there there are there are zombies there but it really is about a broader existential
[02:10:15.920 --> 02:10:20.640]   threat and how we all deal with it and how we come together as people and um and the latest
[02:10:20.640 --> 02:10:25.840]   episode was beautiful one of the greatest uh standalone episodes of the last decade probably
[02:10:25.840 --> 02:10:32.000]   of any show uh i often thought of this show as being a warm hearted apocalypse show but now i know
[02:10:32.000 --> 02:10:35.840]   exactly yeah i mean the one after the apple event pretty much is yeah
[02:10:35.840 --> 02:10:43.600]   thank you Jason thank you Andy thanks Alex i apologize to everybody this was a short show because

[02:12:18.560 --> 02:12:25.040]   molar the molar molar mac oh my god give me the horror mac g3

[02:12:36.800 --> 02:12:42.400]   good trial and the g3 mac molar versus the cavity creeps as drawn by jack kirby
[02:12:42.400 --> 02:12:50.560]   okay wait wait wait wait wait what is this again oh wait imagine imagine all right what what
[02:12:50.560 --> 02:12:58.160]   do we have here imagine the g the the whatever the whatever the actual name of that power mac g3 all
[02:12:58.160 --> 02:13:06.960]   in one power one over three all wait wait wait wait i can't type that fast all in one okay go ahead
[02:13:06.960 --> 02:13:18.080]   being uh being fought by or fighting by cavity creeps fighting the cavity creeps as drawn by jack
[02:13:18.080 --> 02:13:25.120]   kirby talia you don't want to go to world.com what is that you want to go to and light times.com
[02:13:25.120 --> 02:13:31.920]   slash game slash wertl uh dash a r3 there's two colors uh two colors don't go to wertl.com because
[02:13:31.920 --> 02:13:39.440]   that's not it no no don't do it it'll hack your computer there's the key is what do the colors mean
[02:13:39.440 --> 02:13:44.320]   again so the key is audio style those are the first two words i can never get less than three
[02:13:44.320 --> 02:13:53.040]   because i start with those all the it's all the it is all of the vowels plus y plus st so once you
[02:13:53.040 --> 02:13:56.880]   cut that down i get it in three or four almost everything oh i thought you were doing always
[02:13:56.880 --> 02:14:01.360]   do you think about mid-journey prompts journey prompts
[02:14:01.360 --> 02:14:09.120]   that's the special hack i always do something uh like i did tears today i always do something that's
[02:14:09.120 --> 02:14:18.000]   got uh the first few vowels i like tees because e t a i o n s h r d l u or the highest frequency
[02:14:18.000 --> 02:14:22.160]   letters in the english language i like to put s at the end because i want to get that out of the
[02:14:22.160 --> 02:14:27.680]   way if it's a plural i hate it when they do that but you but in this case did you hear about the
[02:14:27.680 --> 02:14:32.880]   did you hear about the wheel of fortune controversy where somebody uh contestant like didn't didn't
[02:14:32.880 --> 02:14:38.880]   guess it correctly because uh the prompt with the category was like fun past times or something
[02:14:38.880 --> 02:14:45.520]   and the the answer was go out for a jog and he said that's not that's not fun that's the that's
[02:14:45.520 --> 02:14:51.840]   that they hate that and he literally like actually like said that to pat and now there's an uproar
[02:14:51.840 --> 02:14:55.440]   saying actually that was good that should have been the that should have been the category
[02:14:55.440 --> 02:14:59.920]   no one enjoys going out for a jog what are you talking about oh my god and of course there's a
[02:14:59.920 --> 02:15:07.600]   whole thing on entertainment tonight about it uh pets up in arms up in arms i tells you scandal
[02:15:07.600 --> 02:15:15.440]   scandal so i don't know i don't know where the g3 is in here but here's the oh wow that's jack kirby
[02:15:15.440 --> 02:15:25.200]   all right yeah i just don't see the g3 but uh maybe in the head of the of the the lower left hand one
[02:15:25.200 --> 02:15:30.560]   okay we're gonna get it's funny to see that the cavity creeps were a series of commercials for
[02:15:30.560 --> 02:15:35.680]   crest that was actually like the storyboards were did the characters were designed by jack kirby so
[02:15:35.680 --> 02:15:40.320]   uh that's maybe two just one on the nose you know maybe two on the nose yeah yeah yeah hold on let's
[02:15:40.320 --> 02:15:46.640]   let's see i i did it i ran it oh wait hold on hold on stop the presses we have another one here um
[02:15:46.640 --> 02:15:56.080]   wow look at that i think oh there's a little lower than the lower left yeah he's got he's got a
[02:15:56.080 --> 02:16:01.520]   little bit of an all-in-one there so i think that's our machine it's it's got yeah it's got
[02:16:01.520 --> 02:16:07.200]   some that that you know as espresso does stain the teeth so it's it's getting there yeah yeah exactly
[02:16:07.200 --> 02:16:13.120]   this is actually a plug for the segment that uh Alex is gonna do on ask the tech guys on sunday
[02:16:13.120 --> 02:16:21.120]   explaining how he uses mid-journey to generate these amazing uh ai uh art i think people increasingly
[02:16:21.120 --> 02:16:25.280]   are agreeing that mid-journey is the best of them of stable oh yeah it's i think it's just i think
[02:16:25.280 --> 02:16:29.200]   it's just the amount of people using it and and and here's the thing that's different about mid-journey
[02:16:29.200 --> 02:16:34.080]   it's the fact that there are so many people using it which improves its its solution but they're
[02:16:34.080 --> 02:16:39.040]   trading so many notes so that's the big thing is that you're because you can see so much in in the
[02:16:39.040 --> 02:16:44.080]   discord in the discord community inside a mid-journey you're seeing what everybody else is using as search
[02:16:44.080 --> 02:16:49.040]   as search terms and so everybody's learning from each other at our at an incredible pace and so i
[02:16:49.040 --> 02:16:54.560]   think the the result is is that you get better uh you get better solutions anyway i'll try to find
[02:16:54.560 --> 02:17:00.640]   one that here that that uh um i it was one of the first that i played with and i still am in the
[02:17:00.640 --> 02:17:07.440]   discord but i have to pay it now i think to uh to take advantage of it but you can actually put
[02:17:07.440 --> 02:17:13.280]   give them your picture and say generate some headshots for me and things like that so yeah i'll
[02:17:13.280 --> 02:17:17.120]   show how to do that in that in the video the good you know all you really have to do is is you just
[02:17:17.120 --> 02:17:21.680]   throw your video you throw your own image into the into your well if you have your own bot you just
[02:17:21.680 --> 02:17:25.840]   throw it into the discussion and say use this link but if you you or if you have your your picture
[02:17:25.840 --> 02:17:31.280]   anywhere on the web you can just say copy link and then you put the say imagine then you put the link
[02:17:31.280 --> 02:17:35.760]   in and then as whatever you want to and it can do that with one image you can do a pretty good
[02:17:35.760 --> 02:17:41.600]   job that's a pretty good job yeah i mean with someone like with someone uh you know that has a
[02:17:41.600 --> 02:17:46.160]   bunch of stuff on the web that has had stuff on the web you can just say the name and it'll pick it up
[02:17:46.160 --> 02:17:52.320]   like a you know there's there's definitely like social media folks generally have a lot of pictures
[02:17:52.320 --> 02:17:57.360]   on the web and so it's already it's already looked at those uh so it can it can sometimes do better
[02:17:57.360 --> 02:18:01.360]   if you just put your name in if you if you have enough photos so imagine the other one probably
[02:18:01.360 --> 02:18:07.120]   would uh yeah yours is worse yours i i tried one with your images and it it was pretty much the same
[02:18:07.120 --> 02:18:12.720]   yeah yeah like it doesn't you don't need to upload that image well we'll look forward to that on
[02:18:12.720 --> 02:18:17.760]   sunday uh i can't wait i want to i want to i want to learn how to use this there's but yeah there's a
[02:18:17.760 --> 02:18:24.240]   guy who's spending a lot of energy working on a uh image of batman in havana cuba in 1959
[02:18:24.240 --> 02:18:32.160]   it's it's pretty fun i have to say that so this is this is what you see you see what people are doing
[02:18:32.160 --> 02:18:38.480]   you see what the prompt is and you can learn from that which is kind of cool yeah i see the value of
[02:18:38.480 --> 02:18:43.920]   that yeah and and and you and the ones you'll get into you'll get the beginner ones are okay but if
[02:18:43.920 --> 02:18:48.000]   you go down to the ones that are like the new daleys i don't want to be new get out of the newbies and
[02:18:48.000 --> 02:18:53.840]   go into like the there's one down there or there's a daily one and then there's and and then the
[02:18:53.840 --> 02:18:57.440]   the ones down there where the folks that really are really know what they're doing they really
[02:18:57.440 --> 02:19:02.480]   into it and you'll see these these long search terms and i don't i think some of the search terms are
[02:19:02.480 --> 02:19:09.680]   you know kind of a mythical like i don't think they actually do anything but they put them in and
[02:19:09.680 --> 02:19:17.200]   they get great images here we go yeah there's a little magical thinking in the yes so but some of
[02:19:17.200 --> 02:19:20.480]   them obviously make a difference and so you have to kind of play with them to figure out which ones
[02:19:20.480 --> 02:19:24.480]   are actually making a difference and which ones are just they think that that was like when you put
[02:19:24.480 --> 02:19:29.120]   a kn i don't think it doesn't anything it doesn't write an ak which right uh or hdr but if you put
[02:19:29.120 --> 02:19:33.680]   glam lighting in it definitely makes a difference so so you gotta learn from you that's who i gotta
