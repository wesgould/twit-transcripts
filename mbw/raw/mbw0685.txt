[00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:37.360]   I am Mike Asargent in for Leo Laporte this week while he is on vacation and joining us
[00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:40.320]   here in the studio right into the love to me.
[00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.280]   I'm Ms. Donald Alex Lindsey. I don't know why I'm doing this voice but I am.
[00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:46.000]   Hello. Hello. Hello. How are you?
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:46.880]   I'm doing well.
[00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:50.000]   Good. Good. Happy to have you here in the studio.
[00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:56.560]   I think that we may have done this show together once before but I was on Skype.
[00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:00.880]   This is the first time here in person. Sounds exciting.
[00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:06.400]   We are also joined by iMores managing editor Lori Gill.
[00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:10.160]   Hello. How are things in Sacramento?
[00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:13.520]   They're okay. Nothing's on fire so that's good.
[00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:15.440]   That's good. So far so good for you.
[00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:22.960]   Yeah. And WGBH Boston's Andy Anotko. How are things for you in Boston?
[00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:29.760]   Absolutely nothing that I can complain about when talking to people who are living where you
[00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:33.920]   guys are living. I have electricity. It's a little bit crisp.
[00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:41.040]   The rain sort of washed out the town like Halloween parade but again that's nothing I'm
[00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:45.680]   going to complain about because my Twitter feed is full of people who've changed their
[00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:52.080]   handles from Eugene to Eugene safe from the fires.
[00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:57.600]   Yes. So I'm not. No. Everything is wonderful. Wonderful. Wonderful.
[00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:00.160]   Well I'm glad to hear that. How are you?
[00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:07.280]   Everything's. Yeah right. How are you? It's somewhat okay. There's a smell of smoke in the air as we're
[00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:14.800]   doing this and you know we're all keeping our eyes on everything but just trying to make it happen
[00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:20.720]   is what we're doing. And yeah I think so far we've been pretty successful in doing that.
[00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:25.280]   Some of us are without power. Some of us have power and we all are.
[00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:27.120]   I've gotten really good at boiling water outside.
[00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:31.280]   You're telling me you had your coffee boiled this morning?
[00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:34.000]   Every morning. Since Saturday. Not that I'm bitter.
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.160]   Oh since Saturday. Bitter electricity has been off since Saturday.
[00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:43.680]   Yeah the worst part was I landed from India and got to the house at one o'clock and then was told
[00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:48.320]   that I had three hours before we were going to lose power. So in India by the way that the power was
[00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:53.680]   pristine. Excellent power there. In fact there wasn't even a hum on the current.
[00:03:53.680 --> 00:04:02.240]   No no no no. Perfectly conditioned. So yeah I suppose that means that it's a time to kick
[00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:09.360]   off the show this week and by golly I think we have to start with what ended up being an announcement
[00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:18.560]   via press release instead of something that was part of any event which is the new as they're
[00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:28.480]   properly pluralized the AirPods Pro. Those launch tomorrow for $249 AKA $250.
[00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:33.680]   And I don't know were any of us at all surprised about this?
[00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:42.880]   No. No. I think it's a good lesson for a lot of other companies where Apple has chosen to only
[00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:46.880]   like pick and choose what they're going to do a big live stream and do a keynote for
[00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:51.440]   and just simply release things. I think some companies get a little over you get overly over
[00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:56.560]   verbose and that's what I think that's cool. So anyway so I think that Apple.
[00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:00.880]   No no no well okay I was going to say exactly sorry we interrupted you go ahead
[00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:03.040]   and clear your thought before I leap in to argue with.
[00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:09.280]   Well I think that I think that it would be a lot of work to do a keynote about
[00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:16.320]   your AirPods. Mm-hmm. Yeah. I was just well I was just going to I was just going to respond that
[00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:24.080]   even before Lori jumped in that it's compared to also Apple doing the doing what seems to be the
[00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:29.280]   logical thing by saying you know it's earphones okay and they basically take sound from a device
[00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:33.440]   and they put them inside your ear that's not a whole lot we need to discuss we will.
[00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:41.120]   When I saw that when I saw that Renee once again had a picture on his Instagram of his watch
[00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:44.960]   regarding a flight to New York like okay he's getting everything he's going to have hardware
[00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:49.200]   today that's perfectly fine and the other way the other good way of doing it was the way that
[00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:54.560]   like mature way of doing I think is the way that Google announced their their earphones which is
[00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:58.720]   by the way we're we have announcement here's what they are here's what they're going to do
[00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:03.520]   we're not going to be shipping them until until February or so but here's what they're going to be if
[00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:07.840]   you want if you've been holding up to see what we would do with wireless earphones and how much we
[00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:12.720]   would charge you for them now you know factor that into your decisions and I know that Apple did
[00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:17.520]   the exact same thing with the with the other products before but I think that we put too much
[00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:23.280]   stock into but isn't it wonderful to be surprised and okay we're not eight years old it's not Christmas
[00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:28.400]   Eve or whatever holiday or birthday Eve or whatever we just have we have a certain fixed amount of
[00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:33.920]   money to wish to budget like our tech purchases and it's nice to know that if we really want
[00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:39.360]   wireless earphones perhaps we should wait and plan for a few months or get them right now or it's
[00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:43.200]   it's okay to not be surprised it's okay to be informed I think that the biggest misstep was
[00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:49.120]   posting an image with clear the clear version the transparent look for the things good that's what
[00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:53.680]   I was like I was like I was like whoa are they selling those and I looked at it and I was like oh
[00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:58.560]   they're white you know like I was you know like I had clear ones were amazing they looked so cool
[00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:04.400]   you can actually see wax being impacted in it as you use at least that way I know why my earfoot my
[00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:09.200]   air pods have stopped working I have one that doesn't put out any sound at all one that puts out
[00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:14.800]   50% of the sound it originally did and I know that there's a couple little friends hanging out in
[00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:21.280]   there that I can't get to which is disgusting yes but by golly it would be nice no but that clear
[00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:25.360]   version on the side is you're scrolling through and you can see sort of what makes up the components
[00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:30.080]   yeah I kind of I wouldn't be surprised if they come out if somebody comes out that what's that color
[00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:34.960]   company that makes like custom yeah color where yeah color where color where if they you should do
[00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:40.960]   a clear one yeah because they can't you know they can paint them you know what color where get on
[00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:48.640]   it figure it out oh what were the guy that gold plates them and I don't know if I want them gold
[00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:55.040]   again I think the best solution is let's you should be proactive and actually like get them in the
[00:07:55.040 --> 00:08:00.160]   color of earwax so that they will never look gross they will always look actually brand new and
[00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:04.720]   shiny if anything it'll be that was my that's still my favorite thing about edamotix because I
[00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:08.960]   still haven't a pair of edamotix that I use mostly because of the failings of the current
[00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:14.560]   AirPods which was that they aren't loud enough on a plane and so the the edamotix are still what
[00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:19.680]   I use when I'm watching movies on a plane and the best part of the edamotix is that it's got a little
[00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:25.280]   filter that you can you screw in and pull it out and replace it when it gets all full of stuff oh
[00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:29.200]   I'm not that I don't really care about the replaceable batteries on the AirPods but I really would
[00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:33.920]   like a replaceable filter yeah that would be nice so and you know wax guard and all that kind of
[00:08:33.920 --> 00:08:41.600]   stuff and the problem I think Andy with your idea is that I think that not everybody's earwax is
[00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:46.160]   the same color so it would be I don't want to talk about that I think we're going to get
[00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:50.400]   out of there can we can we get off the earwax subject we're going to let me just that's all
[00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:56.160]   we're talking about today so I like let me just say when you go to the apples website and you click
[00:08:56.160 --> 00:09:04.240]   on AirPods right did it not anger anybody else that the first image that pops up it looks black
[00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:10.480]   at first but then once you scroll you realize that it's just shaded you have to not go on the
[00:09:10.480 --> 00:09:15.600]   by page but on the overview page of that oh they do look pretty dark oh yeah scroll down just a
[00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:21.280]   hair karsten oh wait yours isn't oh wait click learn more and then yeah yeah there you go down
[00:09:21.280 --> 00:09:28.560]   just a hair yeah it's like oh is it is it coming in black no they're lying to us and tricking us
[00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:34.080]   darn it that would be nice that's the first thing I thought when I saw that oh yeah now I want to
[00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:37.840]   know I thought that there were dr. Seuss characters I thought I thought we were gonna be one I thought
[00:09:37.840 --> 00:09:43.840]   we were in a new game of Plants vs. Zombies that is what it reminds me of too a little bit yeah also a
[00:09:43.840 --> 00:09:52.080]   little bit like hairdryers as I think some people have pointed out now I justine posted a short
[00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:58.240]   little video that I believe it was just this morning showing the size of these compared to
[00:09:58.240 --> 00:10:06.400]   normal or that the last generation AirPods and these are actually shorter and smaller than the
[00:10:06.400 --> 00:10:11.120]   typical AirPods which I found interesting because to me they look like they would be bigger and they
[00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:17.600]   do stick out of your ear a little more but the stem is shorter and so they don't quite look as
[00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:24.480]   I don't know robotic maybe there's still a little odd but I think we all got over it at some point
[00:10:24.480 --> 00:10:27.920]   we did like there was there was like oh this looks really weird no it's kind of nice no it's
[00:10:27.920 --> 00:10:33.680]   okay and then they became an internet beam and everyone wanted their AirPods or their AirPods
[00:10:33.680 --> 00:10:40.080]   to look like it right so we started cutting off the wire I kind of I kind of boomerang after after
[00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:45.840]   after other companies started making like completely in the air designs like bows that's
[00:10:45.840 --> 00:10:49.680]   old that only then did I start to notice that wow that does look kind of weird that's
[00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:54.800]   I would not judge somebody for it but it does look kind of odd the audio is a lot better than
[00:10:54.800 --> 00:11:02.000]   the ones without it that's the problem yes for your I like it's it's gonna be it's gonna be a
[00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:07.760]   tough challenge 200 now that they've broken like the 250 dollar barrier this is above someone's
[00:11:07.760 --> 00:11:14.800]   spending willing to spend an extra hundred dollars for convenience and apple oscody and saying okay
[00:11:14.800 --> 00:11:22.160]   this has got to be a great freaking pair of headphones especially now that it's been a couple
[00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:29.440]   years and now you can actually buy decent anchor even makes a very capable pair of truly wireless
[00:11:29.440 --> 00:11:35.520]   earbuds for something like 60-70 dollars and for I'm not speaking for everybody's budget but for
[00:11:35.520 --> 00:11:41.680]   250 dollars these they're comparing it with really really good over the ear headphones
[00:11:41.680 --> 00:11:47.280]   you're comparing it with really really good like bows and ear headphones it has to be
[00:11:47.280 --> 00:11:53.120]   not just like really really good it has to be superb to compete so I'm looking forward to trying
[00:11:53.120 --> 00:11:57.600]   them out looking forward to seeing what people like Renee think about it yeah I mean so with with
[00:11:57.600 --> 00:12:01.920]   these you know one of the things that I've noticed a lot of of these companies are doing
[00:12:01.920 --> 00:12:10.160]   that are releasing their different earbuds air buds iBuds whatever is they feature this
[00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:16.560]   transparency technology and so this is a way to because I think some of the problem with having
[00:12:16.560 --> 00:12:20.560]   these devices in your ears is that a lot of people want to use these while they're commuting while
[00:12:20.560 --> 00:12:25.600]   they're out walking you know whatever it happens to be and by golly some people use them while
[00:12:25.600 --> 00:12:30.800]   they're driving I would wish that people didn't but they do and you need to be able to hear things
[00:12:30.800 --> 00:12:37.040]   around you and so a lot of companies are working in this transparency technology to sort of give
[00:12:37.040 --> 00:12:42.560]   you a perspective of the outside world so apple's built in this little force touch sensor on the
[00:12:42.560 --> 00:12:48.560]   side of the device that when you squeeze it it lets you listen into the environment around you I
[00:12:48.560 --> 00:12:54.480]   think it both disables active noise cancellation and turns on this transparency feature to bring
[00:12:54.480 --> 00:13:00.000]   in certain sounds I think this is a good idea what I find fascinating is how every single company
[00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:04.880]   seems to really be hopping on board with this transparency technology and it used to be just a
[00:13:04.880 --> 00:13:09.280]   few sort of I think there were some kick stars and things like that where they had companies that
[00:13:09.280 --> 00:13:14.320]   were working on earbuds that you could tune to certain sounds and so you'd be able to hear the
[00:13:14.320 --> 00:13:19.280]   airplane announcement and things like that now I see kind of everybody hopping on this train a
[00:13:19.280 --> 00:13:26.160]   little bit and trying to work out a way to unfortunately let you always have your earbuds in and
[00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:29.760]   still be able to interact with the outside world they want you to have your your smart
[00:13:29.760 --> 00:13:34.480]   assistant available to you to be able to listen to music when you want to but then still if somebody
[00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:38.800]   comes up to your desk have a conversation with you or what have you I don't know I think that's
[00:13:38.800 --> 00:13:45.040]   kind of the the idea yeah for me anyway I just want to keep you know I'd like them to be a little
[00:13:45.040 --> 00:13:50.320]   like to last long enough and then you know for me I don't like to keep on switching modes
[00:13:50.320 --> 00:13:54.240]   you know or picking something up I like to just you know there is you know I'm I'm listening to
[00:13:54.240 --> 00:13:58.720]   an audiobook or I'm or I'm listening to music or I'm listening to somebody or dealing with a call or
[00:13:58.720 --> 00:14:03.440]   whatever I'm doing and I think that I mean that is the direction that most of the stuff is going and
[00:14:03.440 --> 00:14:07.840]   I think the transparency makes a big difference because when you are in the car you may not want
[00:14:07.840 --> 00:14:13.200]   to use the car stereo you know for that for a variety of reasons including the fact that the car
[00:14:13.200 --> 00:14:17.760]   Mike generally doesn't sound nearly as good as your headphones that's true if you're on if you're
[00:14:17.760 --> 00:14:22.160]   on a call or maybe your children want to listen to their favorite music and you want to listen to
[00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:28.320]   something completely different they want to listen to baby shark and you just want to listen to I don't
[00:14:28.320 --> 00:14:34.160]   know some anything of the metal version of total the metal version of yeah of uh Africa or ever
[00:14:34.160 --> 00:14:43.040]   yeah now how many do I don't know I'm not enough of an audio file as it were to know how many headphones
[00:14:43.040 --> 00:14:49.360]   or earphones or earbuds whatever offer the microphone that's also facing in towards the ear
[00:14:49.360 --> 00:14:54.560]   canal as well as out so these ones for folks who haven't had a chance to like check these out
[00:14:54.560 --> 00:15:01.360]   the AirPods Pro are using active noise cancellation that has a microphone that faces into the ear
[00:15:01.360 --> 00:15:05.280]   into the ear canal to listen to how things sound there and one that faces out to listen to how
[00:15:05.280 --> 00:15:12.960]   things sound there and then uses that to create anti-noise to cancel out the audio is the microphone
[00:15:12.960 --> 00:15:18.320]   facing in toward the ear canal a common thing in active noise cancellation or is this something
[00:15:18.320 --> 00:15:24.560]   that's more unique to the AirPods Pro or do we know I've never heard of it before so active noise
[00:15:24.560 --> 00:15:28.560]   canceling I mean I can always cancelation I've heard of but not pointing into the ear canal
[00:15:28.560 --> 00:15:36.400]   facing yeah yeah it uses you know the it uses frequencies it uses the frequency pattern and it
[00:15:36.400 --> 00:15:42.480]   recognizes whatever the ambient noise is and it's it sets a pattern that kind of fits within that
[00:15:42.480 --> 00:15:48.080]   range in order to cancel it out that's that's the canceling part of it where that microphone sits
[00:15:48.080 --> 00:15:54.800]   in order to measure that I think that's just different in in all headphones I think this is
[00:15:54.800 --> 00:16:01.600]   probably new ish in that I would assume noise canceling active noise canceling headphones
[00:16:01.600 --> 00:16:08.640]   or sorry earphones it probably has to be done that way in those types because that's where the
[00:16:08.640 --> 00:16:13.680]   room is where the space is so possibly the new pixel buds with active noise canceling might have
[00:16:13.680 --> 00:16:18.720]   something like that inside it I don't remember how they how they said it was set up but just because
[00:16:18.720 --> 00:16:23.840]   of the size I would imagine like maybe that's where the microphone is on that one too well so it's
[00:16:23.840 --> 00:16:28.800]   yeah if I remember correctly if I remember correctly Google said that they're using that plus some
[00:16:28.800 --> 00:16:34.880]   bone conductance to do that so oh that's interesting good old bone conductors yeah so to be clear
[00:16:35.680 --> 00:16:43.360]   Apple has is using two microphones for noise cancellation they have an outward facing microphone
[00:16:43.360 --> 00:16:48.800]   that listens to the environment and then as you mentioned plays that frequency that's the opposite
[00:16:48.800 --> 00:16:54.000]   of the frequency of sound to block that out but they go on top of that and they also listen to the
[00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:59.680]   sound within your ear canal with a second microphone that second microphone hears the sound within
[00:16:59.680 --> 00:17:10.400]   your within your ear canal and fine tunes the EQ as well as takes away some of the sound that
[00:17:10.400 --> 00:17:15.040]   you know might not need to be there so it's doing both noise cancellation for the outside
[00:17:15.040 --> 00:17:20.800]   environment and for the tiny environment within your ear canal as well as fine tuning those frequencies
[00:17:20.800 --> 00:17:26.800]   so that's the part that I'm curious if this internal microphone is new and I have yeah I'll have to
[00:17:26.800 --> 00:17:34.960]   check it out with with the pixel buds and see they might be doing that for the purposes of
[00:17:34.960 --> 00:17:41.520]   usually a big active noise canceling because of the the frequency alterations can lower the
[00:17:41.520 --> 00:17:47.440]   or it can reduce the low end a little it make it a little more high frequency so it's possible that
[00:17:47.440 --> 00:17:54.560]   in order to attempt to balance that so that the the ear earbuds are not too high high end it might
[00:17:54.560 --> 00:17:59.440]   be capturing what's inside your ear in order to say oh it's too high let's lower the frequency for
[00:17:59.440 --> 00:18:04.240]   this song or something like that very cool yeah that's that's pretty neat this is just a guess
[00:18:04.240 --> 00:18:09.440]   if I you know just but by what I know about noise canceling patterns is that like it makes sense
[00:18:09.440 --> 00:18:16.320]   that they might be the the new beats solo pro uses active noise canceling and there's something
[00:18:16.320 --> 00:18:20.640]   that I noticed is that they're not only are they not bass heavy which by the way they're not
[00:18:20.640 --> 00:18:25.920]   bass heavy so anyone who's questioning that they don't do that anymore but what I noticed is that
[00:18:25.920 --> 00:18:33.120]   they also don't like the power beats pro kind of it like ramps up the the bass beat
[00:18:33.120 --> 00:18:40.160]   for music that that's intended to have heavy bass like rap and hip hop it doesn't actually do that
[00:18:40.160 --> 00:18:44.960]   in the beat solo pro which to me means that the high frequency of the active noise canceling
[00:18:44.960 --> 00:18:50.560]   is affecting its ability to like like bring that base quality in there so with these it might
[00:18:50.560 --> 00:18:56.720]   be that apple was was they kind of decided you know our headphones are already not very low and
[00:18:56.720 --> 00:19:01.840]   anyway so let's make sure that it's not too high end like they might be trying to make sure that
[00:19:01.840 --> 00:19:07.040]   they have a better balance once it's once it passes through the active noise canceling okay
[00:19:07.040 --> 00:19:13.040]   well yeah I was looking at pixel buds while you were talking and I can't see any tech specs for
[00:19:13.040 --> 00:19:18.720]   them it's mostly just like hey these are coming soon get on the wait list so that remains to be seen
[00:19:18.720 --> 00:19:25.440]   if they offer that same feature but anybody order them yes I did as well my
[00:19:25.440 --> 00:19:28.640]   thirst is it tomorrow or Thursday that they're coming I forget
[00:19:28.640 --> 00:19:34.960]   minor coming to Thursday I think yeah minor come in a day later I think minor also coming a day
[00:19:34.960 --> 00:19:40.480]   later a day late in a dollar short darn it there are some people you should check your check your
[00:19:40.480 --> 00:19:46.960]   order because there are some people who originally had it for October 31st and it's being updated to
[00:19:46.960 --> 00:19:52.720]   the 30th so I checked mine this morning and I have not been updated to October 30th but anybody else
[00:19:52.720 --> 00:19:58.000]   who was on the 31st check your order status it might have changed and you might get a date early
[00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:05.600]   present that would be fun in fact my amazon echo buds were originally scheduled to arrive tomorrow
[00:20:05.600 --> 00:20:11.520]   and will be coming today so I'm trying kind of all of these out to play them ear ear to ear
[00:20:12.800 --> 00:20:18.400]   trying to see how they all work and which ones you know offer good transparency and not and
[00:20:18.400 --> 00:20:23.440]   how they work with the different virtual assistants you know mine still say Thursday
[00:20:23.440 --> 00:20:29.520]   October 31st now one of the complaints with these with these air pods is that you know some people
[00:20:29.520 --> 00:20:35.200]   have the first generation air pods or the second generation air pods and they are
[00:20:35.200 --> 00:20:42.320]   having different issues as they're using them so for me like I mentioned one of my air pods completely
[00:20:42.320 --> 00:20:46.400]   doesn't put out sound anymore and the other one puts out sounded about 50% of the original
[00:20:46.400 --> 00:20:51.920]   output that it had and these and Andy I in fact I think we talked about this a little bit on the
[00:20:51.920 --> 00:20:58.880]   last episode that this is not a small investment I mean it's not a huge investment but for some
[00:20:58.880 --> 00:21:04.400]   people this is not a small investment and to think that these these headphones that I buy are only
[00:21:04.400 --> 00:21:14.960]   going to last a year is not great now Apple does offer a the replacement program that's called what
[00:21:14.960 --> 00:21:23.120]   is AppleCare Plus but apparently those repair costs are up to eighty nine dollars per earbud
[00:21:23.120 --> 00:21:32.800]   with I believe this is without AppleCare with AppleCare it's about twenty nine dollars for
[00:21:32.800 --> 00:21:38.960]   the replacements but yeah I remember when I took my current air pods in to be serviced or to see if
[00:21:38.960 --> 00:21:42.960]   there was anything I could do about them they said well you can buy you're since out of warranty
[00:21:42.960 --> 00:21:48.640]   you can buy another air pod for eighty nine dollars but if you buy that air pod then it's going to
[00:21:48.640 --> 00:21:54.400]   come the output's going to be 100% and then the one that's only at 50% is going to sound bad so
[00:21:54.400 --> 00:21:59.760]   they're basically useless at this point yeah yeah that that's going to be problematic I have the
[00:21:59.760 --> 00:22:05.200]   the specs the specs of these of them say that there's more like a water resistance
[00:22:05.200 --> 00:22:10.080]   and so that might help things out but the other thing is that by definition these things are not
[00:22:10.080 --> 00:22:15.200]   going to be easy to replace a battery it's not going to be easy to do any kind of a service on
[00:22:15.200 --> 00:22:22.480]   that apart from replacing the whole darn thing and I don't know how many people are comfortable with
[00:22:22.480 --> 00:22:27.280]   that kind of a track record on this kind of a product parenthetically Renee Richie five minutes
[00:22:27.280 --> 00:22:33.840]   go posted his picture of his own ear pods with the with the traditional any questions tag so
[00:22:33.840 --> 00:22:39.440]   just so yes we were he wasn't he wasn't he wasn't going to New York just to see the revival of the
[00:22:39.440 --> 00:22:46.160]   the Lion King so but yeah I think that that's going to be difficult because batteries this
[00:22:46.160 --> 00:22:50.000]   this small they are really really twitchy when you keep especially when you're recharging them
[00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:55.840]   wirelessly you it's harder to it's harder to keep the thermal properties correct it's harder to keep
[00:22:55.840 --> 00:23:00.960]   them protected from everything that happens in the environment and it really does make you feel
[00:23:00.960 --> 00:23:07.840]   minus when you spent just 180 dollars on a pair of earbuds and you find that just a year or two
[00:23:07.840 --> 00:23:15.040]   later they are you're getting sound out of them but they're kind of useless as 180 dollar earbuds
[00:23:15.040 --> 00:23:21.200]   this is this is why my I really am I do feel like I'm in the market for another pair of nice truly
[00:23:21.200 --> 00:23:25.600]   wireless earbuds I'll probably be buying another pair sometime early next year but
[00:23:25.600 --> 00:23:32.560]   part of my calculus is going to be what I rather basically buy a find a really good pair of 60 or
[00:23:32.560 --> 00:23:38.240]   70 dollar earbuds like an like the anchor pair and know that if they do go south I will be able
[00:23:38.240 --> 00:23:43.360]   to buy I'll be able to replace them twice maybe three times or four times before I catch up to what
[00:23:43.360 --> 00:23:49.920]   I would have lost on buying the apple earbuds or the bows earbuds it's it's a tough tough decision
[00:23:49.920 --> 00:23:55.600]   for a lot people to make I think I think for me it's really just the ease of use you know I
[00:23:55.600 --> 00:24:00.160]   I know that they're you know I and I've had them since they came out and mine still work fine
[00:24:00.160 --> 00:24:05.760]   I will admit that I'm I clean them pretty often it's kind of a nervous habit of mine like while
[00:24:05.760 --> 00:24:09.120]   I'm talking on the phone or something like the one of them I'll take one off and I'll take that
[00:24:09.120 --> 00:24:12.560]   if you wonder why I don't like to have video conferencing so anyway so
[00:24:14.560 --> 00:24:19.200]   so but I tend to clean things when I'm on video conference or on audio conferences and so
[00:24:19.200 --> 00:24:22.880]   that tends to be one of the things and so I probably shouldn't have said that on a show
[00:24:22.880 --> 00:24:29.760]   so anyway cleaning something right now you just can't see it yeah you can you can you can
[00:24:29.760 --> 00:24:35.280]   never fault Alex for for ear hygiene during a conference call exactly exactly so so anyway but
[00:24:35.280 --> 00:24:41.600]   so mine have lasted pretty well and for me I was so excited about the idea of bluetooth I've
[00:24:41.600 --> 00:24:47.360]   been buying bluetooth earpiece I mean I have so many in my desk I just have you know like
[00:24:47.360 --> 00:24:51.920]   everybody's bluetooth because I was just I was like I'm gonna this is all gonna work and it just
[00:24:51.920 --> 00:24:58.560]   was fail fail fail fail fail fail fail where it breaks up it's hard to pair it you know there's
[00:24:58.560 --> 00:25:04.000]   all the problem you know it's the UI is difficult but whatever it is it was always something where
[00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:07.600]   I was like oh I'm gonna go back to wired so the AirPods for me were the first ones where I was
[00:25:07.600 --> 00:25:11.760]   like oh it just works you know there's something about the case that makes it easy to just pop
[00:25:11.760 --> 00:25:18.640]   them back in and and very quickly it's very you just it just all worked so I think that that's the
[00:25:18.640 --> 00:25:24.400]   advantage that apple has brought to the market where all the other ones are good but they're
[00:25:24.400 --> 00:25:29.680]   just missing that last little bit of refinement that makes it easy to use and and just something
[00:25:29.680 --> 00:25:38.400]   to use every day that's with these this AirPods when I worked from home I got them while I worked
[00:25:38.400 --> 00:25:45.120]   some because I was writing over at iMore so I needed to write about these and I didn't have
[00:25:45.120 --> 00:25:52.160]   really a good use case for them at that point because I wasn't mobile a lot and so I could listen
[00:25:52.160 --> 00:25:57.600]   through speakers and it was just my dogs who I would annoy with my music choices sometimes so
[00:25:57.600 --> 00:26:02.720]   that wasn't so much of a concern I could play my audiobooks or podcasts or music out loud and
[00:26:02.720 --> 00:26:09.440]   so it's only been in recent months in fact like the last one that I move here in the beginning of
[00:26:09.440 --> 00:26:14.880]   August since that point that I've been using my AirPods and wishing that they the left one worked
[00:26:14.880 --> 00:26:19.840]   and that the right one put out full audio because I'm using them for calls I'm using them I like
[00:26:19.840 --> 00:26:27.120]   to use them to move between different devices very easily and so that's why I'm excited about these
[00:26:27.120 --> 00:26:33.280]   is because I'll finally like have the reason to need them and be able to use ones that feature
[00:26:33.280 --> 00:26:37.360]   these extra features like the active noise cancellation and the the transparency stuff so
[00:26:37.360 --> 00:26:45.680]   I'm interested to see if they serve as much of an improvement Renee Richie has already called me
[00:26:45.680 --> 00:26:53.600]   out on Twitter so somebody asked is it easier or harder to clean earwax off and Renee says
[00:26:53.600 --> 00:26:58.560]   to be determined but you'll be able to buy a pair of replacement tips for $2.95 so my
[00:26:58.560 --> 00:27:05.520]   sergeant will be able to change his monthly because I also am a little bit like about AirPods being
[00:27:05.520 --> 00:27:11.520]   gross and and the price of that is fantastic are those I wouldn't I don't know if there's details
[00:27:11.520 --> 00:27:15.600]   but I wonder are the is that the price that Apple is selling them for are these just generic
[00:27:15.600 --> 00:27:21.120]   replacements because that's a really great price probably Apple if he's asking Apple directly I
[00:27:21.120 --> 00:27:28.720]   mean that's my guess and then there's another tweet Carson I'll pop it into the show notes run
[00:27:28.720 --> 00:27:36.400]   down here I know I'd need to just plug in my laptop but Scott Stein at Jet Scott on Twitter
[00:27:36.400 --> 00:27:43.840]   posted a photo of him with the original AirPods in his ears and then the new AirPods Pro in his
[00:27:43.840 --> 00:27:49.920]   ears and they are pretty incognito in comparison so I find that fascinating how they've gotten
[00:27:49.920 --> 00:27:57.760]   smaller and especially because especially because one of the things that consistently showed up in
[00:27:57.760 --> 00:28:02.320]   reviews is that whether it's because they have that little external bit or not the connectivity is
[00:28:02.320 --> 00:28:08.240]   always has been stronger the the clarity of your calls has been stronger so it's so it's okay to
[00:28:08.240 --> 00:28:13.360]   have a little bit sticking out the only other thing that I've that it's kind of interesting to me
[00:28:13.360 --> 00:28:17.440]   about this is that other companies excuse me when I'm sorry not other companies but Google
[00:28:17.440 --> 00:28:21.920]   specifically when they were talking about the earbuds their their own earbuds it wasn't just about
[00:28:21.920 --> 00:28:26.720]   hey look we've got our own wireless ear we've got our own truly wireless earbuds coming too it was
[00:28:26.720 --> 00:28:31.840]   look at how well this integrates with the Google Assistant and look how far you'll be able to
[00:28:31.840 --> 00:28:36.800]   stray from your phone and still have access to assistant features it's not just basically
[00:28:36.800 --> 00:28:42.480]   promoting it not just as a way to enjoy music but as a way to have sort of like wearable technology
[00:28:42.480 --> 00:28:49.280]   whereas apple doesn't seem to be stressing that as much as as Google is and if you if you're trying
[00:28:49.280 --> 00:28:55.040]   to get 250 dollars or more out of me one of the ways to do that is to say it's not just for just
[00:28:55.040 --> 00:28:59.520]   you know rocking out some gang of four while you're waiting for a bus it is also so that you can
[00:28:59.520 --> 00:29:03.920]   just be hanging out and not have to reach for your phone in order to leave a note for yourself or
[00:29:03.920 --> 00:29:08.480]   get a note from yourself so I hope that apple isn't missing a trick there certainly are enough
[00:29:08.480 --> 00:29:15.360]   sensors in here to enable that kind of that kind of party trick in the new air pods but
[00:29:15.360 --> 00:29:19.200]   what I'm saying is that apple doesn't seem to have put a section on the on the website the
[00:29:19.200 --> 00:29:24.000]   information page on here's what you can do with these beyond just making it now you'll have
[00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:27.440]   schlomo available to you pretty much wherever you want and you don't have to take your phone
[00:29:27.440 --> 00:29:31.520]   out of your pocket in order to just do what you want to do you can just keep on running keep on
[00:29:31.520 --> 00:29:34.880]   walking and it'll all take care of itself for you yeah because that's something that amazon has
[00:29:34.880 --> 00:29:43.760]   been very forward about um they the whole point of there in your buds is hey hey boo boo can you
[00:29:43.760 --> 00:29:48.320]   tell me where I find carrots in this whole food markets that I'm in and it'll say you know i'll
[00:29:48.320 --> 00:29:55.280]   three or you're using them to set reminders or make calls and so it is supposed to be this uh
[00:29:55.280 --> 00:30:01.840]   audio first computing device and you're right that apple seems to be sort of putting this uh
[00:30:01.840 --> 00:30:07.040]   first and foremost as and it's kind of like how they're positioning the home pod where first and
[00:30:07.040 --> 00:30:12.080]   foremost it's this premium listening experience but there's so much more to or there can be so
[00:30:12.080 --> 00:30:18.880]   much more to these uh than just that I agree maybe maybe they're kind of purposefully putting
[00:30:18.880 --> 00:30:23.840]   cereal in the back burner here because they don't want people to talk about oh great something I
[00:30:23.840 --> 00:30:30.800]   can put my ear that doesn't work so yeah maybe they're purposefully like you know yeah yeah
[00:30:30.800 --> 00:30:38.320]   Siri can do some things but you know whatever well and we should note too that ios what is a 13.2
[00:30:38.320 --> 00:30:45.920]   uh just yes i think it's 13.2 just launched um okay we're just talking about on ios today
[00:30:45.920 --> 00:30:51.040]   yesterday but um they actually pulled it so i don't know if you know that but they pulled it
[00:30:51.040 --> 00:30:56.880]   early this morning because it was um causing pretty bad issues for home pod users and a lot of people
[00:30:56.880 --> 00:31:04.800]   were having um they couldn't update their home pod or it was um spinning out it wasn't working so um
[00:31:04.800 --> 00:31:10.960]   just so you know don't uh don't update to 13.2 just yet and actually if you haven't even tried you
[00:31:10.960 --> 00:31:16.080]   won't be able to because they pulled it now do we know is just whether it's just the home pod version
[00:31:16.080 --> 00:31:21.520]   or is it ios as a whole do we know it's it's ios 13 they pulled they pulled all of ios 13 to
[00:31:22.480 --> 00:31:28.480]   fix whatever because okay i must i may have gotten in just under the wire because i updated just like
[00:31:28.480 --> 00:31:34.800]   an hour or so before the show and it found the it didn't alert me to the update but i checked
[00:31:34.800 --> 00:31:41.280]   for update it downloaded and installed it and maybe it's bad yeah i'm seeing a chat too that
[00:31:41.280 --> 00:31:49.680]   ios 13.2 is okay it's the home pod version oh okay uh bold okay just the home pod version okay so
[00:31:49.680 --> 00:31:56.080]   don't update your home pods um but but do you update your older phones yeah it's all getting
[00:31:56.080 --> 00:32:01.040]   very complicated yeah i know right update all of the things but not your home i'll get to the iPhone
[00:32:01.040 --> 00:32:07.520]   5 in a little bit yeah um but the one the thing that i wanted to note with ios 13.2 is that there are
[00:32:07.520 --> 00:32:15.360]   some new features available with Siri um that include a new uh chime whenever you get a message
[00:32:15.920 --> 00:32:22.560]   and it's it's uh what is it called respond with Siri i can't remember exactly what the terms are but
[00:32:22.560 --> 00:32:28.480]   it is specifically made to work with your air pods where you can communicate with Siri so i think
[00:32:28.480 --> 00:32:35.920]   that they are thinking about the the experience between Siri and here it is announce messages with
[00:32:35.920 --> 00:32:40.880]   Siri have Siri read out messages without having to unlock your iPhone when second generation air
[00:32:40.880 --> 00:32:45.120]   pods and some beats headphones are connected Siri will avoid interrupting you and will listen
[00:32:45.120 --> 00:32:51.920]   after reading messages so you can reply without having to say hey boo boo um and so that actually
[00:32:51.920 --> 00:32:57.520]   lets you a little bit better have that conversation but i agree andy that they're not really doing a
[00:32:57.520 --> 00:33:05.920]   good job of sort of marketing that as part of the the fun of getting these new air pods and for and
[00:33:05.920 --> 00:33:10.320]   to be uh to be honest maybe it's just that they understand that most people are buying these just
[00:33:10.320 --> 00:33:14.960]   for headphones and you really want to underscore here's how good they are and here's how here's the
[00:33:14.960 --> 00:33:19.440]   practical stuff that you're going to really enjoy before trying to sell you on the idea of wearable
[00:33:19.440 --> 00:33:26.880]   technology yeah that's a good point uh all right well i think that takes care of of the air pods
[00:33:26.880 --> 00:33:34.240]   conversation for sure um why don't we talk about apple this is a bloomberg report that talks about
[00:33:34.240 --> 00:33:40.640]   how apple may feel a little bit like it's falling behind the competition in terms of uh it's smart
[00:33:40.640 --> 00:33:48.240]   home efforts and so they are working on or they have a new team uh that is supposed to help
[00:33:48.240 --> 00:33:56.080]   overhaul uh this their their whole effort so this includes not only making it easier for third party
[00:33:56.080 --> 00:34:01.920]   companies who make smart home gadgets to be able to integrate with home kit to get that works with
[00:34:01.920 --> 00:34:08.320]   home kit certification but also that apple may be working on its own smart home devices which i
[00:34:08.320 --> 00:34:14.880]   think is is uh fascinating thing and i'm curious does apple need to be playing in this space
[00:34:14.880 --> 00:34:19.920]   directly i think absolutely okay i'm sorry like yeah tell me as a person who wants to automate
[00:34:19.920 --> 00:34:24.960]   their whole house and and has experimented with a bunch of these other bits and pieces it's fine to
[00:34:24.960 --> 00:34:29.600]   have works with home kit or whatever but apple needs to take a leadership position in this and
[00:34:29.600 --> 00:34:33.520]   in these to create devices that do this because i don't really want to i haven't found any it's
[00:34:33.520 --> 00:34:38.320]   it's the same problem i had with bluetooth headsets that that the you know just couldn't quite find
[00:34:38.320 --> 00:34:42.000]   the ones that work the way i want in the same way with a home automation they're all just a little
[00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:48.000]   funky and you know that because they just uh people who build electronic devices for the most part
[00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:53.120]   don't really get it i'm sorry i mean you know like the the amazon google apple those guys get it
[00:34:53.120 --> 00:34:58.400]   the folks that are making the a lot of that stuff they don't just get the user interface the user
[00:34:58.400 --> 00:35:03.920]   experience at that level um you know they're so used to i mean they've been building
[00:35:03.920 --> 00:35:11.120]   really just crap for decades and it's hard for them to get their head you know pulled out of a
[00:35:11.120 --> 00:35:18.400]   dark space to to do something um actually innovative that will be great to have in your house and so
[00:35:18.400 --> 00:35:23.840]   and i have my house when i bought it i already had a lot of of the older generation of of things so
[00:35:23.840 --> 00:35:29.200]   i'm still kind of getting ready to unwind all of that um but uh i just don't think anyone else is
[00:35:29.200 --> 00:35:34.960]   going to get it and i think that apple can this is a big market for apple to to build the tools the
[00:35:34.960 --> 00:35:40.320]   locks the the camera you know at the level that apple wants to do it and make it the way apple
[00:35:40.320 --> 00:35:47.440]   users wanted to perform especially given how detailed so home kit was sort of one of my beats
[00:35:47.440 --> 00:35:54.480]   and i still pay a lot of attention to it uh going through the home kit requirements looking at those
[00:35:54.480 --> 00:36:00.400]   the least the stuff that was available without having to be an actual partner um they are very
[00:36:00.400 --> 00:36:06.320]   detailed about the way that they see things being done and in order to get the works with home kit
[00:36:06.320 --> 00:36:13.280]   badge even to be able to market that way and so it's clear that they have a a they have a vision
[00:36:13.280 --> 00:36:16.560]   for how they want it to work and i can't say i don't want them to make it easier like i don't
[00:36:16.560 --> 00:36:20.960]   want them to lower the bar so that other people can just make stuff that isn't working and then
[00:36:20.960 --> 00:36:25.280]   we go okay that now we're stuck with that right i want them to keep the bar exactly where it is
[00:36:25.280 --> 00:36:30.720]   and then say either you go down this path or we'll go down that path and that is if you look at the
[00:36:30.720 --> 00:36:35.760]   if at the watch it's probably not a thing that home automation folks want is for apple to the
[00:36:35.760 --> 00:36:41.760]   side that this is a market that they could take because they can mm-hmm yeah it's i want to all
[00:36:41.760 --> 00:36:48.480]   about opportunity i'll start go ahead lori i would love to see more um it's like privacy
[00:36:48.480 --> 00:36:53.760]   related home kit things directly from apple or any i guess home kit privacy things like um
[00:36:53.760 --> 00:36:59.520]   the you know we're getting um video uh security cameras and things like that i'm
[00:36:59.520 --> 00:37:06.720]   kit secure video yeah yeah so if apple did that i would feel i would i would throw all of my other
[00:37:07.360 --> 00:37:14.240]   home kit uh secure all of my other video doorbells and whatnot in the garbage because i would feel
[00:37:14.240 --> 00:37:21.200]   a lot safer and knowing that that apple would be kind of a little bit better about taking care
[00:37:21.200 --> 00:37:27.680]   of my privacy and things like that and also um mesh Wi-Fi might be kind of nice a home kit enabled
[00:37:27.680 --> 00:37:31.760]   mesh Wi-Fi directly from apple that would be that would be kind of fun so yeah if they're if
[00:37:31.760 --> 00:37:36.400]   they're really getting back into it i think that it would it would behoove them to kind of stick
[00:37:36.400 --> 00:37:41.680]   with what they're known for which is privacy and security and own and like focus on home kit things
[00:37:41.680 --> 00:37:48.880]   that can enable that i i think they'd be they would win for sure in that market yeah yeah absolutely
[00:37:48.880 --> 00:37:53.760]   well that's if there's one thing that that keep biting people in the butt uh with uh with
[00:37:53.760 --> 00:37:58.720]   internet of things hopefully we've retired that to that hopefully we've retired that term uh the
[00:37:58.720 --> 00:38:04.320]   basically home integrated into your house sort of technology it really is privacy and security apple
[00:38:04.320 --> 00:38:10.320]   is the one company that uh you oh it's they they don't have a perfect track record both of those
[00:38:10.320 --> 00:38:14.480]   things but there is vulnerable as any other mortals who are working in this in this plane of
[00:38:14.480 --> 00:38:20.400]   existence but still that's the that's what you associate with them uh and it's such a heartbreak
[00:38:20.400 --> 00:38:26.080]   that they totally decided to sit out uh on mesh technology because if you think about a problem
[00:38:26.080 --> 00:38:30.960]   that is easily that is frustrating to solve that apple can uh can uh can solve very well that they
[00:38:30.960 --> 00:38:35.840]   solve very very well with their first round of wireless networking products and then what they
[00:38:35.840 --> 00:38:41.440]   could do with mesh not only by uh letting a mesh mesh network solve the use the the biggest problems
[00:38:41.440 --> 00:38:46.320]   of wireless networking in the home which is fixing dead spots but also saying well actually here's
[00:38:46.320 --> 00:38:51.440]   also an opportunity every time that someone puts in a hundred and twenty nine dollar network extender
[00:38:51.440 --> 00:38:57.280]   we can also extend shlomo there or we can extend awareness of who's in what part of the house there
[00:38:57.280 --> 00:39:01.520]   to make sure that they can that we can extend services to these people exactly where they
[00:39:01.520 --> 00:39:08.800]   want to go uh and so and if it's such a big problem for them to be missing this boat because um i
[00:39:08.800 --> 00:39:16.880]   uh i used to be a mixed uh amazon google like home personal assistant household until i moved in
[00:39:16.880 --> 00:39:22.720]   which case i made the choice of okay i'm definitely gonna unplug i'm definitely not going to reinstall
[00:39:23.360 --> 00:39:28.560]   all of my amazon stuff it's all gonna be google stuff and every few months something else
[00:39:28.560 --> 00:39:35.920]   either it happens either through a new product update or a new uh o s update or a uh or an
[00:39:35.920 --> 00:39:41.520]   enhancement or a new piece of hardware that makes me even more happy that i'm standardized on google
[00:39:41.520 --> 00:39:48.000]   just a just a few weeks ago or just a week ago they added a feature where now you can pair any two
[00:39:48.560 --> 00:39:55.280]   uh of the nest or you know google home smart speakers as a stereo pair so it used to be that you
[00:39:55.280 --> 00:39:59.840]   you could only do that with like the big expensive three hundred and fifty dollar mojo speaker
[00:39:59.840 --> 00:40:05.280]   now if you even if you have two twenty dollar uh those two twenty dollar little uh little dot
[00:40:05.280 --> 00:40:12.160]   speakers uh style speakers uh i had uh i while ago i realized for example that i don't necessarily
[00:40:12.160 --> 00:40:17.440]   if uh in my bedroom if it's if it's late at night i don't necessarily need to have like the big
[00:40:17.440 --> 00:40:22.000]   speaker system when i'm watching a movie it's okay for me to have to like one one those little
[00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:26.080]   dot speakers on each nightstand and it kind of frustrated me that i couldn't pair them as a
[00:40:26.080 --> 00:40:31.680]   stereo pair but now i can get stereo sound that is like apt just just focused on the head of the bed
[00:40:31.680 --> 00:40:35.840]   without like rattling that's much more clear than having a speaker in the other side of the room
[00:40:35.840 --> 00:40:39.760]   certainly allows me to crank it up as loud as i want without uh without bothering the neighbors
[00:40:39.760 --> 00:40:43.360]   and that's the sort of it sounds like a very simple thing but that's the sort of thing that
[00:40:43.360 --> 00:40:48.000]   makes me even more amenable the next time that there is i have a choice between buying
[00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:53.040]   a google branded uh home networking product or a someone else's home networking product
[00:40:53.040 --> 00:40:56.640]   i've had good experience with these i feel as though i'm making an investment that will pay off
[00:40:56.640 --> 00:41:02.240]   in the future and that's where i go for whereas as important as apple products are inside my house
[00:41:02.240 --> 00:41:05.360]   it's just not yes and exactly and of course that was
[00:41:09.920 --> 00:41:15.680]   i'm sorry but yeah but that again i'm underscoring the fact that i do have these these gielmo products
[00:41:15.680 --> 00:41:21.520]   all throughout my office but it's it's as important as the mac is and and i always is to my house
[00:41:21.520 --> 00:41:27.280]   the how we do my work it's kind of bothering me that it's a complete non-entity not only that but
[00:41:27.280 --> 00:41:33.440]   the one time that they did create some sort of a smart speaker product it was a ridiculous to me
[00:41:33.440 --> 00:41:39.280]   for my as a personal consumer not as advice to other people it was a ridiculous idea that i would
[00:41:39.280 --> 00:41:45.760]   buy one of their smart speakers given that it does practically nothing compared to anything
[00:41:45.760 --> 00:41:49.600]   else that i have including the stuff i don't use anymore so it's it bothers me that they're
[00:41:49.600 --> 00:41:54.320]   kind of sitting this one out when you this idea of ubiquitous computing the idea that you can just
[00:41:54.320 --> 00:42:00.800]   ask a question into the air or or request a task to be done and that that task it's done for you
[00:42:00.800 --> 00:42:04.880]   or you're interacting with your environment or you're you're locking down your house
[00:42:04.880 --> 00:42:08.800]   all this stuff that is so cool if you have stuff that is not made by apple but if you have stuff
[00:42:08.800 --> 00:42:14.400]   by apple you just are sort of in the you're in your you're in the house practicing your violin
[00:42:14.400 --> 00:42:19.760]   lesson about watching people play and have a great time outside yeah i mean i i i i agree i
[00:42:19.760 --> 00:42:25.840]   you know i think that uh for a lot of apple users apple is limited only by their own
[00:42:25.840 --> 00:42:30.480]   imagination of where they want to go there's a lot of us that which is why you know if they came
[00:42:30.480 --> 00:42:34.880]   out with us you know like i i look at a heston makes this incredible stove you know it's like five
[00:42:34.880 --> 00:42:41.680]   stove tops where all the pans can talk to your phone and your in your phone uh can talk to the
[00:42:41.680 --> 00:42:45.520]   stove and so you can have all the pans running at a certain temperature and you can follow all
[00:42:45.520 --> 00:42:51.280]   the things around and uh as far as i was able to just buy heston and then just making it the apple
[00:42:51.280 --> 00:42:55.840]   stove and we would all buy it you know like like you know you know and and i looked at amazon made
[00:42:55.840 --> 00:42:59.440]   a microwave that you can you know talk you can talk to the microwave and have it do its thing and
[00:42:59.440 --> 00:43:04.640]   and if apple released that microwave i would replace the microwave i had i have a samson uh
[00:43:04.640 --> 00:43:09.120]   refrigerator i would replace it with an apple refrigerator if they if they gave me one and so
[00:43:09.120 --> 00:43:14.560]   so i think that the thing is is that apple you know has as you know ever since the steve years
[00:43:14.560 --> 00:43:18.640]   has been very focused on we're going to do one thing really well and i think that that's admirable
[00:43:18.640 --> 00:43:24.000]   but i think that there are as we get to the post-iPhone world uh and it's not going to be when we say
[00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:32.400]   post the next one will see five years or whatever as it winds out uh that um you know that they could
[00:43:32.400 --> 00:43:37.120]   diversify into all of these things that touch your phone or touch each other you know i don't think
[00:43:37.120 --> 00:43:42.400]   apple should necessarily get into making shovels although i probably buy those as well um but but
[00:43:42.400 --> 00:43:49.760]   i think that uh but i think that you know that a kind of the oxo of oh my god electronic stuff of
[00:43:49.760 --> 00:43:53.440]   you know we're going to figure out how this all works really really well together because there's
[00:43:53.440 --> 00:43:57.520]   all these things i can imagine i want my house to do but then i go out and look at these products
[00:43:57.520 --> 00:44:03.760]   and i'm just like oh no i mean you know anyway so i'm gonna get my mid-night green shovel
[00:44:03.760 --> 00:44:11.600]   i i would definitely buy apple shovel you know i i that's a that's a good example uh oh xo but my
[00:44:11.600 --> 00:44:17.200]   my worry is that institutionally apple is the one uh oxo will but will make anything that you were
[00:44:17.200 --> 00:44:22.400]   using the kitchen in the household and they may do a good job of it. Exactly i have so many ox
[00:44:22.400 --> 00:44:27.520]   i just bought an oxo uh broom just just last week because i again that's a brand that i trust i know
[00:44:27.520 --> 00:44:31.120]   that it's going to work well even though it costs a few dollars more so it's a very good analogy
[00:44:31.120 --> 00:44:38.080]   but apple is the company that says here's why we don't make a spatula now we studied how people
[00:44:38.080 --> 00:44:43.520]   lose their own thing and turning you pencils and it just it just wants to give us you know uh you
[00:44:43.520 --> 00:44:48.960]   know i really do need a sketch here here is uh here's why you don't need a spatula but i do
[00:44:48.960 --> 00:44:54.480]   be more like no andy andy andy andy more like here's why you don't need a handle on that pan yeah you
[00:44:54.480 --> 00:45:01.600]   know like it's it's an innovative it's yeah we took the pan off because it's it's uh brave
[00:45:01.600 --> 00:45:09.120]   and we still have a lightning connector instead of usb c hey it's courage it's courage uh and i'm
[00:45:09.120 --> 00:45:14.240]   going to courageously take us to a little bit of a break here uh today mac break weekly is brought
[00:45:14.240 --> 00:45:21.600]   to you by worldwide technology wwt began building their advanced technology center that's a tc about
[00:45:21.600 --> 00:45:27.840]   ten years ago and it has grown exponentially the lab contains more than a half billion dollars
[00:45:27.840 --> 00:45:33.360]   and equipment it's like no other testing and research lab out there wwt is a trusted partner
[00:45:33.360 --> 00:45:37.200]   who stays with you over the years in fact many of their customers have been with them for over
[00:45:37.200 --> 00:45:42.960]   a decade because they know wwt is where they can go to get the answers they need to make sure their
[00:45:42.960 --> 00:45:49.440]   business runs right their atc is an incubator for it innovation there are hundreds of on-demand
[00:45:49.440 --> 00:45:54.960]   and schedulable labs representing the newest advances in multi-cloud architecture security
[00:45:54.960 --> 00:46:01.520]   networking primary and secondary storage data analytics and ai devops and whoo i got a breathe
[00:46:01.520 --> 00:46:06.800]   because they've got so much more you can learn about products before you launch wwt's engineers
[00:46:06.800 --> 00:46:13.440]   use these environments to quickly spin up proofs of concept and pilots using the sandbox so customers
[00:46:13.440 --> 00:46:19.360]   can confidently select the best solutions in many cases this reduces concept time from months
[00:46:19.360 --> 00:46:25.200]   to weeks which of course increases speed to market they offer lab as a service a dedicated
[00:46:25.200 --> 00:46:30.480]   lab space within the atc here customers can perform programmatic testing using the vast
[00:46:30.480 --> 00:46:36.400]   technology ecosystem that wwt has already built and it's virtual so you can take full advantage of
[00:46:36.400 --> 00:46:44.080]   atc's unique benefits anywhere in the world 24/7 wwt engineers work in these labs every day beta
[00:46:44.080 --> 00:46:48.640]   testing new equipment and building reference architectures and custom integrations to help
[00:46:48.640 --> 00:46:54.960]   their customers make decisions and see results faster and with much less investment the time
[00:46:54.960 --> 00:47:01.680]   is finally here wwt has launched their new digital platform encompassing the atc ecosystem
[00:47:01.680 --> 00:47:07.360]   this ecosystem creates a multiplier effect of knowledge speed and agility anytime
[00:47:07.360 --> 00:47:12.240]   anywhere around the world for their customers you can get access to articles case studies hands-on
[00:47:12.240 --> 00:47:17.840]   labs and other tools that make the difference in today's fast-paced world to learn more about
[00:47:17.840 --> 00:47:25.760]   worldwide technology and join the atc ecosystem all you got to do is head to wwt.com/twit and create
[00:47:25.760 --> 00:47:36.160]   an account today wwt simplifies the complex that's wwt.com/twit wwt delivering business and technology
[00:47:36.160 --> 00:47:42.080]   outcomes around the world thanks so much to wwt for sponsoring this week's episode of mac break
[00:47:42.080 --> 00:47:49.600]   weekly and let's get back to it folks all right what else do we have here let's see let's see well
[00:47:49.600 --> 00:47:56.320]   you got apple ramping up iphone 11 assembly apparently the iphone 11 max is getting a little bit of a
[00:47:56.320 --> 00:48:04.240]   cut there so clearly the the every person phone is the popular phone i mean this is to be expected
[00:48:04.240 --> 00:48:10.640]   right there's one phone that comes in many different colors and is at a more palatable price point
[00:48:10.640 --> 00:48:17.040]   and then you've got one that of course is uh quite pricey and only comes in a slightly green color
[00:48:17.760 --> 00:48:22.640]   well i mean it comes in other colors too but the green is only slightly green uh so is anyone
[00:48:22.640 --> 00:48:30.480]   surprised by the fact that they that they're cutting iphone 11 max orders i'm hoping that this
[00:48:30.480 --> 00:48:38.560]   is evidence that people are not as interested in this super big phone that as they used to be
[00:48:38.560 --> 00:48:43.680]   and that maybe in the next few years we'll get that for a shy phone back i knew it i knew
[00:48:43.680 --> 00:48:51.040]   laura was gonna go there laura loves the small phone i do i do i love it i mean it makes sense it's um
[00:48:51.040 --> 00:48:55.680]   i'm too old for it see my i have to have the big phone or longer arms what do you say
[00:48:55.680 --> 00:49:02.080]   all right so i i have had trouble i went back i was playing with an old i think iphone 4 or something
[00:49:02.080 --> 00:49:06.560]   the other day and and i realized i just can't there's no one i could see it now when i bought it i
[00:49:06.560 --> 00:49:11.200]   could see it but now i i can't i mean i'm gonna be honest with you i've got a few friends who have
[00:49:12.320 --> 00:49:16.400]   they can see long distances but they can't see up close what is that my op my opia
[00:49:16.400 --> 00:49:21.600]   fire sided yeah far-sightedness uh that's what i have and it's short and i
[00:49:21.600 --> 00:49:26.800]   short and short-sided it's a little bit of both a little bit of that this and that um and so they
[00:49:26.800 --> 00:49:32.160]   have the magnifying feature turned on and right i was looking at the front i was like i kind of like
[00:49:32.160 --> 00:49:37.760]   this i have my text i turned up as high as it can go so that i can actually yeah i have to put my
[00:49:37.760 --> 00:49:42.560]   glasses on very impressive you really you really appreciate user interfaces that
[00:49:42.560 --> 00:49:48.560]   understand simplicity and clarity i don't it's not it's not a vision problem it's more of a even when
[00:49:48.560 --> 00:49:55.120]   you have a max sized or pro sized phone it's not necessarily going to it doesn't having more screen
[00:49:55.120 --> 00:49:59.680]   real estate is useful when you're reading stuff not necessarily when you're trying to get something
[00:49:59.680 --> 00:50:06.000]   done with an app and so the the least useful apps that i get are the ones that give me a lot of
[00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:11.680]   targets to hit and try to do too much at the same time instead of reconceptualizing what this app
[00:50:11.680 --> 00:50:18.720]   should be doing in the form of a phone app versus a tablet app versus a desktop app but i i have to
[00:50:18.720 --> 00:50:24.000]   say that i think the part of the part of it is the people understanding that i think they got a
[00:50:24.000 --> 00:50:29.760]   little bit of a feature fatigue i think that it's difficult for every manufacturer of phones to come
[00:50:29.760 --> 00:50:37.920]   across to find a way to explain why they're 29 the 2019 version of a phone is better than the 2018
[00:50:37.920 --> 00:50:43.360]   or the 2017 version of the phone because every single time that i get a new phone to review or to
[00:50:43.360 --> 00:50:50.000]   take a look at it comes down to i i spent a lot of time trying to dig as deep into it trying to sense
[00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:54.400]   where there where is there a new point of view where is there a new perspective where is there a
[00:50:54.400 --> 00:51:00.960]   sign of a new understanding of how people interact with and rely on their mobile devices and it almost
[00:51:00.960 --> 00:51:06.880]   always comes down to here's how much faster the processor is here so how much better the camera is
[00:51:06.880 --> 00:51:13.600]   and that's a really really hard sell and it's no wonder why the first huge huge huge success that
[00:51:13.600 --> 00:51:18.960]   other companies have been having is basically by trying not to compete with a thousand dollar
[00:51:18.960 --> 00:51:23.600]   phones and trying to see how good they can be to make a five hundred dollar phone and i think that
[00:51:23.600 --> 00:51:29.840]   i really do think that the iPhone 11 is one of the best devices that apple has made iPhone or not
[00:51:29.840 --> 00:51:37.200]   it read they found a way to reduce the price and really hone down exactly what an iPhone is and
[00:51:37.200 --> 00:51:41.200]   what it should be i don't think they've redefined anything but they figured out here's what's
[00:51:41.200 --> 00:51:46.400]   important to add here are the things that we don't really necessarily need and even understanding that
[00:51:46.400 --> 00:51:52.560]   it is okay for us to make to make decide that one of our major features is something as simple as
[00:51:52.560 --> 00:51:57.440]   we're offering it in a range of colors if you want the banana phone we are more than happy to sell
[00:51:57.440 --> 00:52:03.920]   you the banana phone because people don't instead after years of saying now we've had a new color
[00:52:03.920 --> 00:52:09.200]   now instead of just two shades of gray we have three shades of gray it's no maybe we want our
[00:52:09.200 --> 00:52:14.160]   phone to be a little bit more fun and distinctive and personalized but yeah it comes down to i think
[00:52:14.160 --> 00:52:19.200]   that the iPhone 11 is one of the best devices that apple has made certainly one of the best in the
[00:52:19.200 --> 00:52:23.760]   iPhone line and it's not because of they've done revolutionary things with display technology or
[00:52:23.760 --> 00:52:28.880]   CPU technology or security technology or machine learning i think it really is because they figured
[00:52:28.880 --> 00:52:33.840]   out let's let's find the best phone we can make for seven hundred dollars that doesn't seem to
[00:52:33.840 --> 00:52:37.760]   omit anything uh that and the reason why we're getting the price down is because we're throwing
[00:52:37.760 --> 00:52:43.680]   away things that are not necessarily the things that translate into a more useful phone or or
[00:52:43.680 --> 00:52:49.200]   greater value for the user it'd be great it'd be great if it had USB-C oh well but hopefully we'll
[00:52:49.200 --> 00:52:53.840]   see that next year i don't i think that the the fact that they're cutting orders doesn't
[00:52:53.840 --> 00:52:58.320]   necessarily also mean that the max is not necessarily successful selling millions of other
[00:52:58.320 --> 00:53:03.840]   others product or still billions of dollars of revenue so you know it's as a mark i think as a
[00:53:03.840 --> 00:53:10.960]   constantly pushing you know what is kind of pushed on the outer envelope one year becomes the middle
[00:53:10.960 --> 00:53:15.920]   of the road the next year so you know i think that getting some people to pay a premium who
[00:53:15.920 --> 00:53:19.600]   want to pay that premium where that's actually a valuable thing for them i think makes sense
[00:53:19.600 --> 00:53:24.240]   and so i think that apple will continue to do that i mean i love what they did with the mac pro
[00:53:24.240 --> 00:53:28.880]   where they just said okay we're not going to worry about the middle of the road we're going to build
[00:53:28.880 --> 00:53:33.040]   the best possible product that we can make or and they actually talk to professionals i think
[00:53:33.040 --> 00:53:37.040]   because they actually produced put everything in that all of us were missing from the trashcan
[00:53:37.520 --> 00:53:41.280]   and and they didn't make it something that we could call a trashcan which is one of the
[00:53:41.280 --> 00:53:46.160]   problems but i think we called it a trashcan because because it was you know resembled it so
[00:53:46.160 --> 00:53:51.520]   anyway so well now you have a cheese grater so you're okay i love the cheese grater i i was like i
[00:53:51.520 --> 00:53:57.520]   all i wanted was a cheese grater that was a little more updated and i like so i'm good with that so yeah
[00:53:57.520 --> 00:54:06.720]   yeah yeah so i i one one thing also i to to think about though with the the 11 max 11 pro max
[00:54:07.440 --> 00:54:13.520]   um with the reduction in in in making more of them but those words just came out all
[00:54:13.520 --> 00:54:20.800]   all backward here we go again um since iphone has been making two two
[00:54:20.800 --> 00:54:25.680]   phone or since apple's been making two phones that are exactly the same except for their screen
[00:54:25.680 --> 00:54:31.440]   size and a third phone that's slightly less expensive and has slightly slightly less um
[00:54:31.440 --> 00:54:38.000]   features you're you're faced with this this this price comparison at this point because
[00:54:38.000 --> 00:54:46.160]   you can go the the low cost route with the iphone 11 you could go the middle range price with the
[00:54:46.160 --> 00:54:51.920]   iphone 11 pro or what's the point in the iphone 11 pro max other than screen size i think when people
[00:54:51.920 --> 00:54:58.640]   are consumers are looking at these three options that i think comes to mind of well there's no
[00:54:58.640 --> 00:55:04.000]   difference between the 11 pro and 11 pro max other than the screen size so why would i spend
[00:55:04.000 --> 00:55:09.440]   that extra money so i'm going to focus my attention more on the 11 versus the 11 pro because there's
[00:55:09.440 --> 00:55:14.480]   where there's really distinctive feature differences and there's going to be those those people who
[00:55:14.480 --> 00:55:19.520]   will always buy the largest sized phone and that you know so apple will always have that size for
[00:55:19.520 --> 00:55:25.280]   them but everyone else will be comparing prices and features and and so the max will just be out
[00:55:25.280 --> 00:55:31.120]   of the equation completely i i do find it amazing i when i picked up my iphone 4 from you know years
[00:55:31.120 --> 00:55:35.200]   ago moves it on my desk and i picked it up yesterday and looked at it compared to the phone i have
[00:55:35.200 --> 00:55:41.520]   now and i'm just like wow like we've come a long come a long way not necessarily a good way in
[00:55:41.520 --> 00:55:45.440]   some ways i mean i i agree with you in some in some respects that i would love to have another
[00:55:45.440 --> 00:55:50.720]   like my international phone i'd love to have it be small again i had a small one i had the
[00:55:50.720 --> 00:55:56.800]   c and then i of course it was traveling so i left it amstradam oh no it's still probably still in the
[00:55:56.800 --> 00:56:11.520]   safe so let's go ahead and talk about uh we've we've we've covered iphone 11 iphone 11 pro
[00:56:11.520 --> 00:56:17.840]   wife a lot of pro max but let's talk about an old phone old friend of ours which is the iphone 5
[00:56:17.840 --> 00:56:27.040]   uh lori you've got one week okay in mind the sc mind's the sc mind's mind is actually still
[00:56:27.040 --> 00:56:32.720]   in relatively good condition i don't have the five i have the sc look i know when you before you
[00:56:32.720 --> 00:56:37.200]   go to bed at night you tuck in like three different iphone fives and give them a little kiss on their
[00:56:37.200 --> 00:56:42.640]   camera uh front-facing camera and then you read them a bedtime story from your iphone se
[00:56:42.640 --> 00:56:48.480]   and you got to make sure that these get updated uh look at that look at that beautiful chassie
[00:56:48.480 --> 00:56:53.360]   yes i want my phone to look like that again it's gorgeous
[00:56:53.360 --> 00:57:00.800]   well um if you do have an iphone 5 out there uh you need to be updating to the latest version of
[00:57:00.800 --> 00:57:09.280]   iOS that's available to those devices um basically there is an issue that uh impacts gps location
[00:57:09.280 --> 00:57:16.960]   performance but also can mess up the system date and time and so if you don't update uh before
[00:57:16.960 --> 00:57:22.240]   this week is up then it will you have to go through a complicated restore process in order to get
[00:57:22.240 --> 00:57:28.240]   your device working again so there's always this conversation about how people on older iphones
[00:57:28.240 --> 00:57:32.320]   are being throttled and slowed down and given poor performance and this and that and the other
[00:57:32.320 --> 00:57:39.440]   and apple is warning folks hey you know you need to be updating your phones uh if you want
[00:57:39.440 --> 00:57:43.600]   them to continue to work but i imagine that there will be folks out there with iphone fives who
[00:57:43.600 --> 00:57:50.160]   don't update and then this is you know comes to be another uh bit of evidence uh toward that fact
[00:57:50.160 --> 00:57:55.760]   but yeah i just laura i'm sure you have an iphone 5 phone farm and wow that was iphone 5 phone
[00:57:55.760 --> 00:58:00.560]   farm that was good thank you uh and so i just want you to be you know aware of that
[00:58:00.560 --> 00:58:04.640]   they're all going to get they're all going to get their good night kiss update
[00:58:04.640 --> 00:58:10.800]   for uh before bed tonight these are some of the older ipads as well oh that's a good question it
[00:58:10.800 --> 00:58:18.240]   only mentions the iphone 5 as being needing this update so maybe because of gps maybe there is
[00:58:18.240 --> 00:58:23.840]   the as of it the updates available for older iphones but it might not be an issue of it
[00:58:23.840 --> 00:58:28.080]   like literally stopping working without the update i think for some reason i thought there was a couple
[00:58:28.080 --> 00:58:34.880]   of old ipads that had the same affliction now if if you don't update by the deadline uh you'll have
[00:58:34.880 --> 00:58:41.360]   to back up and restore using a macro pc uh because the over the air software updates those aren't
[00:58:41.360 --> 00:58:47.440]   going to work and neither will an iCloud backup so basically those issues uh with the the date and
[00:58:47.440 --> 00:58:53.360]   the time getting out of sync cause you to not be able to do the over the internet uh backup or
[00:58:53.360 --> 00:59:00.000]   rather you know update so i don't know that you know this this article kind of jokingly says if
[00:59:00.000 --> 00:59:04.080]   you get to that point then you might as well just save yourself to the trouble and buy an iphone 11
[00:59:04.080 --> 00:59:09.920]   i disagree i don't think that it's that difficult to back up in her store using a macro pc but
[00:59:09.920 --> 00:59:15.600]   and i'm sure this was you know tongue-in-cheek but um i think that that still is a complicated
[00:59:15.600 --> 00:59:20.400]   process so just if you've got an iphone 5 hit that update button it'll be good for you a promise
[00:59:20.400 --> 00:59:26.480]   but does business say something wonderful about apple that we're talking about a six-year-old phone
[00:59:26.480 --> 00:59:31.760]   it was released in what 2013 and we're talking about the it's a very very credible thing that
[00:59:31.760 --> 00:59:38.960]   people have working iphone 5s and the that that it's even you're it's even capable of being updated
[00:59:38.960 --> 00:59:44.800]   so that it will continue to work uh no other manufacturer like by the time it's three years old
[00:59:44.800 --> 00:59:50.960]   you're like okay i know here's unless i'm unless i want to totally flash all of the ROMs
[00:59:50.960 --> 00:59:56.800]   wipe it out and go to some sort of open source thing to keep it working there's this is a this
[00:59:56.800 --> 01:00:01.680]   is a universe that hates my three-year-old phone and desperately wants to send it back home to Jesus
[01:00:01.680 --> 01:00:11.200]   back home to Jesus um well speaking of updates there is a new update uh for ios ipados as we
[01:00:11.200 --> 01:00:16.320]   mentioned don't upgrade well you can't right now update your home pod uh which is good because
[01:00:16.320 --> 01:00:22.480]   that would potentially break your device but go ahead and update to ios 13.2 because you know for
[01:00:22.480 --> 01:00:29.760]   the average person we have a lot of excitement about new emoji um i personally am excited about
[01:00:29.760 --> 01:00:35.840]   being able to use those new emoji with my friends and family who can you know finally update to 13.2
[01:00:35.840 --> 01:00:39.920]   and i had to like go through and remember oh man this emoji is just going to show up as a weird
[01:00:39.920 --> 01:00:45.520]   question mark in a square on this person's device uh because i'm you know a fool who runs beta's a
[01:00:45.520 --> 01:00:53.040]   lot of the time so i'm looking forward to the people that i talked to having emoji as part of their
[01:00:53.040 --> 01:00:59.680]   their you know latest update as well as sweater mode which of course is also called deep fusion
[01:01:00.560 --> 01:01:10.000]   for for the camera uh some updates to Siri and um i think as well finally finally finally
[01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:18.080]   you can add music to your home kit scenes which for the you know for the everyday person that's
[01:01:18.080 --> 01:01:24.080]   not a big deal but if i want to wake up to lizzo just bumping at the at the top of the hour and have
[01:01:24.080 --> 01:01:29.600]   some some music going on in the background while my lights are flashing on and off to start my day
[01:01:29.600 --> 01:01:32.640]   then by golly i can do that now and i'm really happy about that
[01:01:32.640 --> 01:01:44.320]   so one of the things that is also included with this is um a new feature that uh it's it's a control
[01:01:44.320 --> 01:01:50.480]   center feature for the AirPods pro in fact which i think is interesting so this is um going to be
[01:01:50.480 --> 01:01:56.960]   available if you've got devices that support it which i believe includes some um bows devices and
[01:01:56.960 --> 01:02:04.000]   carsten i actually do have my mac plugged in now um oh you've got it there so the feature lets you
[01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:10.240]   turn up and down the volume on your uh noise cancellation devices but you can see that it has a
[01:02:10.240 --> 01:02:14.960]   toggle here for turning on noise cancellation turning off noise cancellation and turning on the
[01:02:14.960 --> 01:02:21.600]   transparency feature so again uh with the transparency feature turned on it does sort of tune things
[01:02:21.600 --> 01:02:29.840]   to specifically hear sounds externally while keeping your your air your air pods plugged into your ears
[01:02:29.840 --> 01:02:34.880]   so with it off it can still block obviously because it's a silicone tip that's uh in the way
[01:02:34.880 --> 01:02:39.840]   but transparency sort of pipes the audio through which i think is a pretty cool thing and it's
[01:02:39.840 --> 01:02:45.280]   my understanding that this works for any devices that have uh the noise active noise cancellation
[01:02:45.280 --> 01:02:49.920]   technology i'm curious what that interface looks like on the watch oh you know because the um
[01:02:50.560 --> 01:02:56.000]   i can't i'm like the number one time i need to do this is when i'm actually at the supermarket
[01:02:56.000 --> 01:03:00.560]   buying food and i walk up and i now have to talk to somebody because i've been listening to NPR
[01:03:00.560 --> 01:03:08.080]   usually while i'm um uh you know uh you know it's usually all things considered some and i'm
[01:03:08.080 --> 01:03:12.560]   wandering around and buying stuff and so i have to be be able to just listen to them while and
[01:03:12.560 --> 01:03:16.880]   turning that transparency on would be super useful and including turning the transparency off and
[01:03:16.880 --> 01:03:20.640]   stopping them you know like i don't want to play but i don't really want to take my right
[01:03:20.640 --> 01:03:24.720]   that's going out so there's like a whole like mechanics there that seems like it could be a
[01:03:24.720 --> 01:03:28.640]   lot smoother so hopefully that'll be something to do with my watch i like this idea because um
[01:03:28.640 --> 01:03:35.920]   air pods don't like they there's no physical button on that to help you like learn
[01:03:35.920 --> 01:03:40.800]   the process of how to make those changes and do those controls and even with this new
[01:03:41.760 --> 01:03:47.440]   force touch stem it's a it's going to be a matter of remembering did i did i map that to my left
[01:03:47.440 --> 01:03:52.400]   ear did i map that to my right ear to how many times do i have to tap things like that i don't
[01:03:52.400 --> 01:03:56.480]   actually know that the details of the controls yet i don't have mind to know for sure but i'm
[01:03:56.480 --> 01:04:02.160]   assuming that there's like different ways that you tap or press things on the force touch stem
[01:04:02.160 --> 01:04:07.920]   that will affect what it does and and sometimes you just can't remember what those are and just
[01:04:07.920 --> 01:04:12.000]   the ability to like pull it down on control center is a great idea and especially if you can do
[01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:16.560]   that on apple watch so you don't have to pull your phone out just being able to quickly access
[01:04:16.560 --> 01:04:20.960]   those controls and just tap a button real quick on your on your watch instead of going
[01:04:20.960 --> 01:04:24.480]   tap tap nope that was the wrong one press nope that was the wrong one
[01:04:24.480 --> 01:04:34.640]   now let's talk about deep fusion so i can't remember uh oh i was i was talking to Jason Snell on
[01:04:34.640 --> 01:04:40.480]   ios today and he put together a pretty great article i believe over on mac world that may
[01:04:40.480 --> 01:04:46.880]   have been on six colors dot com regardless it will be it will be linked from six colors dot com about
[01:04:46.880 --> 01:04:54.480]   the future of of camera marketing kind of and talking about deep fusion as this feature that
[01:04:54.480 --> 01:04:58.160]   apple announced that wasn't going to come out until later and then they've pushed out with this
[01:04:58.160 --> 01:05:02.880]   update and they're sort of saying hey here's deep fusion here's what it's going to look like
[01:05:02.880 --> 01:05:07.760]   and how we're kind of going from a world where it's all about the hardware of the cameras to a
[01:05:07.760 --> 01:05:14.480]   world where we're talking about the uh the the processing and the machine learning and you know
[01:05:14.480 --> 01:05:22.320]   taking the 52 75 photos at once and putting them together in half of milliseconds and how the the
[01:05:22.320 --> 01:05:29.440]   shift kind of has to take place to say here's why i have the best camera in my phone you know
[01:05:29.440 --> 01:05:37.200]   from a company's perspective and so deep fusion um is this feature that works specifically in
[01:05:37.200 --> 01:05:46.640]   in certain lighting conditions that will provide better sharper detail uh up close and i don't know
[01:05:46.640 --> 01:05:53.200]   i don't know how deep fusion works but i do know how we used to do this and for for visual effects
[01:05:53.200 --> 01:05:59.920]   okay so there was a technique at um at ILM when i was working there that we would take when we were
[01:05:59.920 --> 01:06:05.520]   doing matte paintings basically what happens is you're shooting a plate you know of a background
[01:06:05.520 --> 01:06:11.600]   that you're going to use for you know bunch of spaceships and you you um what you want to do is
[01:06:11.600 --> 01:06:16.000]   get rid of all the grain you know that's in that's inherently in the film that's spinning through so
[01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:20.880]   what you do is you run the you usually get the end of the when you're doing the map and you get like
[01:06:20.880 --> 01:06:29.840]   a tail you know so but you would get 10 or 15 frames and we would take those frames and uh
[01:06:29.840 --> 01:06:35.680]   you'd stack them in Photoshop and one was at 100 percent and the next one was 50 then 12.5 then
[01:06:35.680 --> 01:06:40.880]   6.25 then 3.0 you know and and you just and each one was half the transparency and you just stack
[01:06:40.880 --> 01:06:45.520]   them all up to um i think about 10 of them that were the last one was just a little bit and the
[01:06:45.520 --> 01:06:52.560]   only thing that's different between those um assuming that you've corrected for uh the gate weave is
[01:06:52.560 --> 01:06:59.680]   i'm back in the day when we had to worry about things like gate weave um the uh um the the only
[01:06:59.680 --> 01:07:04.560]   thing that was different between them was the uh grain and so when you got rid of it all it would
[01:07:04.560 --> 01:07:09.760]   be then a grainless image um and then that was which was essentially much sharper all the little
[01:07:09.760 --> 01:07:12.960]   details and everything else then you do whatever you're going to do in computer graphics and then
[01:07:12.960 --> 01:07:17.920]   you put the grain back on so you you you you you add new grain back on top of it so it would fit in
[01:07:17.920 --> 01:07:24.640]   and everything else and so um but i think that uh i when i looked at what they're talking about i
[01:07:24.640 --> 01:07:29.200]   have no i and when they talk about it on you know about what they're doing i feel like it's some
[01:07:29.200 --> 01:07:33.600]   like obviously much more complex version of that of of that process where we're gonna take a whole
[01:07:33.600 --> 01:07:37.040]   bunch of images and we're gonna stack them on top of each other and we're gonna look at just what's
[01:07:37.040 --> 01:07:41.280]   different the only thing that's different from them is the grain we're gonna take that out um it's
[01:07:41.280 --> 01:07:45.520]   gonna give us a sharper image and you know that that is the problem that i've had because what
[01:07:45.520 --> 01:07:49.760]   we're looking at when we look at what our phone took isn't the grain right it's typically the
[01:07:49.760 --> 01:07:57.360]   compressed version of the grain so so i think that that is a the uh i think that that by getting
[01:07:57.360 --> 01:08:02.160]   that sharper source we're obviously getting a much sharper image and of obviously the reason
[01:08:02.160 --> 01:08:06.080]   it's sweater mode is because you you want to have something with tons of little details that you're
[01:08:06.080 --> 01:08:11.920]   gonna see that um that break up in you know that that is just the easiest way to distinguish it i
[01:08:11.920 --> 01:08:16.160]   still hold that they should call it beard mode because the sweater guy that they have in the image
[01:08:16.160 --> 01:08:22.240]   also has uh quite the beard and it's very well it's you know the same thing there um of course
[01:08:22.240 --> 01:08:26.560]   this is not that this is a fresh image here he's got a texture shirt i mean they went
[01:08:26.560 --> 01:08:31.040]   tear me in front of texture in in front of a textured background with a textured
[01:08:31.040 --> 01:08:37.920]   I mean it was like how do we add absolutely everything yeah even the shirt is pretty textured
[01:08:37.920 --> 01:08:42.960]   of course this is a compressed image uh from the site but i think uh it's available here but
[01:08:42.960 --> 01:08:48.560]   yeah i mean that's i like that we got a little bit of uh insight onto what i've no idea if that's
[01:08:48.560 --> 01:08:53.680]   it i mean i think that but i think that there's some there's some that's some relative to uh what
[01:08:53.680 --> 01:08:59.040]   they're you know what they may be doing yeah that's that's a there's a lot of mojo going on i think
[01:08:59.040 --> 01:09:04.400]   that's one of the reasons why i don't i don't think at this point side by side comparisons of
[01:09:04.400 --> 01:09:11.760]   individual cameras tell the whole story anymore i think that there's so much machine learning going
[01:09:11.760 --> 01:09:17.920]   on there's so much processing going on that the best that you can really say at this in 2019 if
[01:09:17.920 --> 01:09:24.960]   you're looking at two uh phones that have sort of equal uh levels of uh of hardware and processing
[01:09:24.960 --> 01:09:31.200]   like the iphone 11 and the pixel 4 the best you can say is that here that that there are going to be
[01:09:31.200 --> 01:09:36.160]   individual circumstances under which one camera one camera takes a better picture than the other
[01:09:36.160 --> 01:09:39.920]   but when you take a hundred pictures in a hundred different scenes i think that both of them are
[01:09:39.920 --> 01:09:44.240]   going to get the same cumulative score they're they're very they're going to be very few circumstances
[01:09:44.240 --> 01:09:50.640]   in which you can you can academically say that uh and objectively say that the the that the pixel
[01:09:50.640 --> 01:09:55.920]   took better low light pictures in the iphone or vice versa or uh one phone took better pictures that
[01:09:55.920 --> 01:09:59.840]   involve like lots and lots of bright colors without blowing out highlights or the other because
[01:09:59.840 --> 01:10:07.280]   there's so much there's so much uh uh a pain where we're one of the side effects of crafting these
[01:10:07.280 --> 01:10:12.960]   synthetic software cameras is that you're going to be integrating what the engineers believe makes
[01:10:12.960 --> 01:10:17.680]   a good picture and what the engineers believes is something that should be avoided and that's
[01:10:17.680 --> 01:10:21.760]   going to be a point of view that's going to be differing between different camera teams uh for
[01:10:21.760 --> 01:10:33.120]   example i find that uh i find that uh one quirk of modern iphone cameras is that they tend to be a
[01:10:33.120 --> 01:10:37.840]   little bit conservative when it comes to punching up the colors in an image even if you're taking
[01:10:37.840 --> 01:10:42.720]   pictures of pumpkins and you really want that orange to be super orange i think that they tend
[01:10:42.720 --> 01:10:48.560]   to be a little bit more conservative they're they're not they're not taking that picture incorrectly
[01:10:48.560 --> 01:10:53.440]   but if you were to do a side-by-side quote comparison unquote between here's the Samsung and here's the
[01:10:53.440 --> 01:10:58.720]   iphone and here's the pixel phone like oh goodness what a terrible horrible embarrassing fail for
[01:10:58.720 --> 01:11:04.080]   the iphone well no if you want it to be more saturated here's a little slider you just nudge it a
[01:11:04.080 --> 01:11:07.520]   little bit and make you make your own decision that you like it to be a little bit more saturated
[01:11:08.080 --> 01:11:13.360]   so that's that's why i'm i'm really sort of i made the mistake of when i had the pixel four for the
[01:11:13.360 --> 01:11:18.880]   first day just taking a picture of like a sandwich in front of me and just not not even attending it
[01:11:18.880 --> 01:11:22.880]   as a side-by-side comparison but just for people who are sort of interested in what two different
[01:11:22.880 --> 01:11:28.560]   cameras would do and my god there was this huge huge flame war of like oh isn't it sad that apple
[01:11:28.560 --> 01:11:34.080]   has or isn't it terrible that google doesn't understand like oh my god you're looking at that
[01:11:34.080 --> 01:11:39.520]   and then i thought then as soon as i recard from that i i did my usual like squirrel test in the
[01:11:39.520 --> 01:11:45.440]   public in the boston's in boston's public garden and i and i know that i'm never ever ever going to
[01:11:45.440 --> 01:11:51.280]   even like casually put like two example of two photos side-by-side but i wanted to say hey isn't
[01:11:51.280 --> 01:11:57.360]   isn't funny and ridiculous that i i i uh on today i had to like take both phones in just because i
[01:11:57.360 --> 01:12:01.520]   wanted to see what they what each one would do with squirrel pictures so i was up there for 45 minutes
[01:12:01.520 --> 01:12:06.080]   taking pictures of squirrels and all there was was i'm okay i'm definitely not going to post
[01:12:06.080 --> 01:12:11.520]   pictures from both but just to illustrate this that hey here's house here's how i spent my afternoon
[01:12:11.520 --> 01:12:17.120]   i put the both cameras on the ground and took a picture of both of them each displaying a different
[01:12:17.120 --> 01:12:22.960]   squirrel photo with my old like pixel one and there are people who even though there even though
[01:12:22.960 --> 01:12:29.440]   these are people who can vote and can drive many of them they were they're able to see that now you
[01:12:29.440 --> 01:12:35.600]   do realize that one of these telephones one of these phones has an OLED screen another phone has an
[01:12:35.600 --> 01:12:41.440]   led screen and both of them are probably set to different brightness levels and to send and to
[01:12:41.440 --> 01:12:48.000]   and to on top of all of that it was a photo taken with a third camera but you're still going to
[01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:54.480]   argue that the iPhone is better or the good you all disappointed me very very much go go to your
[01:12:54.480 --> 01:13:00.880]   room think about what you did don't come out until you could explain until you could uh again i was
[01:13:00.880 --> 01:13:05.760]   so let down like a parent being let down after coming home like after vacation to find out there's
[01:13:05.760 --> 01:13:11.120]   a stain in the rug that none of the kids want to admit to it's like you know i'm not angry i'm just
[01:13:11.120 --> 01:13:16.880]   i put too much faith in you i'm i'm just i learned my lesson i guess you're just already you know the
[01:13:16.880 --> 01:13:21.760]   fun of these i i was wondering why andy was taking all these pictures of squirrels in boston commons
[01:13:21.760 --> 01:13:28.480]   until i was there uh last year and and they literally just they line up for the photos you know like
[01:13:28.480 --> 01:13:32.320]   well i mean like they're like they're ready they're like they're like putting on makeup right one
[01:13:32.320 --> 01:13:36.480]   of the trees and they're like they're talking to each other and and you know they're talking about
[01:13:36.480 --> 01:13:42.000]   unidization and and uh and their residuals and stuff like that but they're but they're already
[01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:47.120]   there and and really the pay is all in it's true you're literally feeding them peanuts i mean
[01:13:47.120 --> 01:13:52.800]   paying them peanuts to to to be like again do you think that i'm joking about this but if you if i
[01:13:52.800 --> 01:13:59.520]   if you sit on a bench and you seem to be like opening a package or something you will suddenly
[01:13:59.520 --> 01:14:04.480]   see like uh squirrels that were like searches foraging suddenly like stand up and look your way
[01:14:04.480 --> 01:14:07.680]   you're saying is that person gonna about to throw up well there's and there's a little there's
[01:14:07.680 --> 01:14:14.880]   the little um cards that sell the the nuts so there's a certain bag that has the nuts and so when
[01:14:14.880 --> 01:14:20.880]   that bag is crinkled they seem to be like from all over there like i hear the bag they're tuned in
[01:14:20.880 --> 01:14:26.640]   oh my goodness but just just to it's not it's not just it's not just fun and games i actually i
[01:14:26.640 --> 01:14:31.440]   started to appleish responsible for this because remember i think was the iPhone 4 where one of
[01:14:31.440 --> 01:14:35.600]   those one of the sample photos that they had for the press was this picture stunning picture of a
[01:14:35.600 --> 01:14:40.320]   squirrel and i felt like i had to i have to try to replicate that with my review of the iPhone 4
[01:14:40.320 --> 01:14:44.240]   and while doing that i realized that wow this is a really good test of how it could because the
[01:14:44.240 --> 01:14:48.640]   squirrel doesn't stay put they don't like if you tell hey look good will you stand still for the
[01:14:48.640 --> 01:14:53.120]   picture for grandma please they will not they'll end up keep moving around their small target and
[01:14:53.120 --> 01:14:57.840]   it wound up being a really good test of like how fast can it capture focus how good is the interface
[01:14:57.840 --> 01:15:02.080]   for that i can like i can take pictures and follow this the subject around so that's why every time
[01:15:02.080 --> 01:15:06.800]   i test out that it's part of my standard test suite i'm and you talk talk about sweater mode how
[01:15:06.800 --> 01:15:12.960]   about squirrel food squirrel fur mode that's gonna be a good test of uh of deep fusion yes the squirrel
[01:15:12.960 --> 01:15:20.000]   fur mode uh well let's take a quick break before we come back and uh round things out uh i want to

[01:17:01.760 --> 01:17:09.680]   some other new updates so along with 13.2 coming out what we were supposed to have in home pod uh 13.2
[01:17:09.680 --> 01:17:16.720]   rolling out was a feature that lets you use different voices so it recognizes multiple voices within a
[01:17:16.720 --> 01:17:22.720]   family and can provide information for those specific people so if i have mine connected my
[01:17:22.720 --> 01:17:29.120]   account connected and my partner has their account connected then we could both talk to the home pod
[01:17:29.120 --> 01:17:36.400]   and get our individual calendars or our individual music library recommendations you know hey booboo
[01:17:36.400 --> 01:17:41.120]   play some songs that i like and it would actually do it according to the songs that i like versus the
[01:17:41.120 --> 01:17:47.680]   songs that my partner likes um there's also a new ambient sounds feature so this is kind of one of
[01:17:47.680 --> 01:17:54.320]   those ideas of of using your home pod kind of like a a noise machine at night it's a bunch of well
[01:17:54.320 --> 01:18:00.080]   that's great that's one of the sounds you can hear no um it's got a bunch of different sounds uh that
[01:18:00.080 --> 01:18:08.240]   are high quality and are perfect for going to to sleep in fact they have uh the option to set sleep
[01:18:08.240 --> 01:18:14.800]   timers now as well so that way i can say i want to play this song you know or keep playing ambient
[01:18:14.800 --> 01:18:21.040]   sounds for the next hour uh and then by that time hopefully you've fallen asleep uh so yeah those are
[01:18:21.040 --> 01:18:26.000]   some of the home pod features that you will eventually be able to get including and i forgot to mention
[01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:34.240]   this this one's kind of fun if i'm listening to some music on my home or on my iphone then i could go
[01:18:34.240 --> 01:18:39.280]   and and put my phone over the top of my home pod and it will transfer the music to start playing
[01:18:39.280 --> 01:18:44.240]   there same thing if i'm oh i'm coming through the door hold on just a second and i want to boop
[01:18:44.240 --> 01:18:49.680]   up it to the home pod then i can take the call there from the home pod which i think is is kind of nice
[01:18:49.680 --> 01:18:56.640]   also i would like to give a live update that um somebody's new whole air pods pro are coming tomorrow
[01:18:56.640 --> 01:19:02.240]   oh you're so lucky you should check yours again lori because mine just up to you i'm gonna check
[01:19:02.240 --> 01:19:07.920]   it right now yeah uh so that's the update that you're going to be getting with home pod and that
[01:19:07.920 --> 01:19:12.720]   should be coming soon i'm curious so i imagine you have a home pod oh yeah yeah had you have multiple
[01:19:12.720 --> 01:19:18.080]   home pods no not yet no not yet he says yeah so so soon well and it's funny we we use different ones
[01:19:18.080 --> 01:19:24.560]   in the kitchen we have the home pod and uh an amazon show and so it's interesting to see how the family
[01:19:24.560 --> 01:19:29.760]   uses the two yeah um so generally the home pod is more of uh we want to listen to music in the in
[01:19:29.760 --> 01:19:37.440]   the kitchen um the but everybody uses the the show as the general interface for asking questions
[01:19:37.440 --> 01:19:43.120]   gotcha so and setting time it turns out the number one use for an amazon amazon show is setting timers
[01:19:43.120 --> 01:19:47.120]   in the kitchen you know like you know as everyone's cooking you just kind of yell out what you want
[01:19:47.120 --> 01:19:55.040]   and and you know uh and and um the what what what do we call that the one for amazon anyway i don't
[01:19:55.040 --> 01:20:02.640]   know the the echo show oh oh what do we call all the ocean anyway so uh anyway so uh we say Alex
[01:20:02.640 --> 01:20:10.080]   Alex so we tell Alex to uh to to go do that and so that it's funny to see the the uses the the
[01:20:10.080 --> 01:20:16.960]   the number one thing that we get with shlomo from the home pod is you can kind of hear the tv
[01:20:16.960 --> 01:20:22.080]   and every once in a while we're in the middle of a show and and and you know the home pod starts
[01:20:22.080 --> 01:20:27.760]   answering a question we didn't ask oh all the time it means like like like how do what is she
[01:20:27.760 --> 01:20:33.360]   why did she do that you know so there's a very odd um interaction between our tv and our our home
[01:20:33.360 --> 01:20:39.280]   pod that happens occasionally lory did you shout out that yours have two yours are coming to tomorrow
[01:20:39.280 --> 01:20:46.000]   and no i just checked and um unless it's not quite updated yet it's still not till the 31st so
[01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:51.840]   i'm still still behind everybody else i might just go down to the store and buy them somewhere
[01:20:51.840 --> 01:20:54.800]   yeah it's like i don't need those ones that are covered in the mail i'm getting them live
[01:20:54.800 --> 01:21:02.720]   uh mica you you're on the beta or you were on the beta of 13.2 was the home pod um update a part
[01:21:02.720 --> 01:21:08.480]   of that back then was that not available yet i can i could never get my home pod to update
[01:21:08.480 --> 01:21:12.880]   when i was on the beta i even installed you know the proper profiles and everything but i could
[01:21:12.880 --> 01:21:18.160]   never get it to update so i stopped even checking i turned off automatic updates with betas and i
[01:21:18.160 --> 01:21:26.160]   i stopped checking so i'm not sure uh that it ever did work um i know that my uh co-host on smart tech
[01:21:26.160 --> 01:21:32.000]   today uh mathy kassan le he would regularly update his home pod and was able to try some of these
[01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:38.480]   features but they were so pretty bad during the during the beta portion so um thank you so much
[01:21:38.480 --> 01:21:44.080]   my question um the question i have is is about you know we don't have it yet so we don't know how
[01:21:44.080 --> 01:21:53.360]   it works but is multiple user home pod gonna be a big failure like it is on apple tv and here's what
[01:21:53.360 --> 01:22:03.200]   i mean um multi-user on apple tv is actually it's only for basically the tv app so you get to sign
[01:22:03.200 --> 01:22:10.160]   in with your different you know user name or whatever and you go to um your home page on apple tv
[01:22:10.160 --> 01:22:16.400]   and it's all of the apps and games that are on the other users apple tv home page if you delete
[01:22:16.400 --> 01:22:20.240]   it on yours it deletes it on theirs if you add one in yours it adds one on theirs you don't really
[01:22:20.240 --> 01:22:27.840]   get to design and customize your home your um your home page it's just for um recommendations
[01:22:27.840 --> 01:22:33.520]   for movies and tv shows for you to watch so it's it's working too hard at a problem that we don't
[01:22:33.520 --> 01:22:38.640]   really care about i mean we use the apple tv all day every day and we just go to the apple tv and
[01:22:38.640 --> 01:22:44.960]   then we go to the movies and then we play them yeah i don't want to recommend the recommendations
[01:22:44.960 --> 01:22:48.560]   you know i don't care about any of the stuff that's showing up there i want and i guess maybe we're
[01:22:48.560 --> 01:22:54.080]   maybe not a good use case but we generally just go to the apps like when we go to youtube i don't
[01:22:54.080 --> 01:22:57.520]   expect youtube to when i go to youtube i'm not expecting it to give me any recommendations in
[01:22:57.520 --> 01:23:01.920]   fact i don't know the last time i clicked on a recommendation i go there because i have a url
[01:23:01.920 --> 01:23:07.280]   of what i want to look at and then i look at it and then i go do something else yeah i will say
[01:23:07.280 --> 01:23:11.600]   a little bit different there i will sometimes see something pop up and i'm like oh that's interesting
[01:23:11.600 --> 01:23:17.360]   but as far as the apple tv goes yeah i so i agree that is a bit of a failing uh i don't think that
[01:23:17.360 --> 01:23:22.320]   they designed it well enough to be something that people would want to use as opposed to what it
[01:23:22.320 --> 01:23:27.680]   is right now where yeah i agree with you um i i so i'm wondering what i'm wondering is home pod gonna
[01:23:27.680 --> 01:23:34.640]   be all the only thing that you get to do is each person's voice gets to have their personal apple
[01:23:34.640 --> 01:23:41.440]   ity recommendations for the for me for apple music that is not all that it does okay but but that
[01:23:41.440 --> 01:23:48.320]   doesn't seem like enough you know yeah i can definitely confirm based on math ukson lee's
[01:23:48.320 --> 01:23:54.800]   use of it that it can it was at least uh able to separate the two voices to say what's on my calendar
[01:23:54.800 --> 01:24:02.240]   versus what's on uh it was his girlfriend's calendar so it does do more than just uh the music
[01:24:02.240 --> 01:24:07.680]   recommendations how much of that it does i don't know if it can do personal messages like what did
[01:24:07.680 --> 01:24:12.320]   my phone just what what text did i just get like you can do right now but just with one user
[01:24:12.320 --> 01:24:16.960]   it'll be interesting to see if it lets you separate that between two i can't imagine any of my family
[01:24:16.960 --> 01:24:22.800]   my kids my wife myself ever wanting our texts coming out of a home pod no it's not like they're
[01:24:22.800 --> 01:24:28.320]   bad it just that it just like that would be like that's weird to me weird yeah yeah let's i'd i
[01:24:28.320 --> 01:24:33.280]   always have that personal request feature turned off because i don't want that there um i my my
[01:24:33.280 --> 01:24:38.960]   text don't even show up on my lock screen oh wow well mine do whenever i look at it and it knows
[01:24:38.960 --> 01:24:46.080]   it's me but um no i'm not without that Alex is like no no me uh yeah he doesn't want his kids to see
[01:24:46.080 --> 01:24:53.120]   the the text from his wife it says are those brats to be gone fed yet no i i think i've just
[01:24:53.120 --> 01:24:57.520]   worked i spent so many years with children i think i've just worked so many years working on secure
[01:24:57.520 --> 01:25:03.120]   events that you just you don't want names popping up of what you're working on and so i just it's
[01:25:03.120 --> 01:25:10.640]   i think culturally we got used to not yeah sharing uh the other thing is that uh macOS
[01:25:10.640 --> 01:25:15.520]   katalina has a new update out a lot of the different software that's gotten an update and
[01:25:15.520 --> 01:25:20.880]   depending on what device it's on it's going to give you the option to opt in to having that
[01:25:20.880 --> 01:25:28.400]   Siri review feature so ios 13.2 has this option now uh macOS katalina has the option which basically
[01:25:28.400 --> 01:25:34.240]   says yeah it's okay if you send my my siri requests to someone to be checked and graded
[01:25:34.240 --> 01:25:40.160]   or no i don't want that to happen um but then it also adds support for the airpods pro so that
[01:25:40.160 --> 01:25:46.640]   you'll have a few more options available to turn on and off the different sounds um i can't wait to
[01:25:46.640 --> 01:25:55.200]   upgrade to katalina in february and you can also delete your siri dic siri in dictation history
[01:25:55.200 --> 01:26:00.320]   within the within macOS which i think is pretty neat that's that's good i shouldn't say neat that
[01:26:00.320 --> 01:26:06.800]   should just be a given but it's uh good that it's there um as well as being able to use the home app on
[01:26:06.800 --> 01:26:12.960]   the mac to control all the new stuff so that's home kit secure video the new home kit supported
[01:26:12.960 --> 01:26:19.040]   routers etc uh so yeah everything's getting a bunch of updates uh to the latest versions that
[01:26:19.040 --> 01:26:25.680]   add these features that we've been hearing about since ww dc uh anybody want to talk about apple
[01:26:25.680 --> 01:26:32.800]   arcade because that's going on my kids love it yeah they've played almost every it could
[01:26:32.800 --> 01:26:37.920]   probably bring my son in he'd probably talk about it all day but all the games but he's they literally
[01:26:37.920 --> 01:26:42.560]   have played almost i when i when it came out i was like i saw the i saw the games and i was like
[01:26:42.560 --> 01:26:49.360]   as this this is gonna be a total fail you know i just wasn't interested at all and um uh so i
[01:26:49.360 --> 01:26:53.280]   put it on the i put it on the apple tv and i just told my son and my daughter that it was there
[01:26:53.280 --> 01:26:58.080]   and it was gone i mean they're just playing it all the time you know and they play it on their
[01:26:58.080 --> 01:27:03.920]   ipad they play it on and they they love i think they love all the games you know and and um they
[01:27:03.920 --> 01:27:09.360]   play someone where these guys are it's like some ragdoll thing where they fall down and and um i wonder
[01:27:09.360 --> 01:27:16.080]   that's what the call yeah yeah and so they're they they're done like i don't even know how they'd fit
[01:27:16.080 --> 01:27:20.480]   other games into their lifestyle now that they've now they've got it and then these new games just
[01:27:20.480 --> 01:27:26.000]   keep coming out so i i i will admit that i i am surprised because i when i when they when i saw
[01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:31.360]   the games they're putting out i was like this looks not very good and uh but i realized i'm not the
[01:27:31.360 --> 01:27:39.200]   target audience they are and um they love it yeah i've uh been enjoying it on and off uh i'm
[01:27:39.200 --> 01:27:45.920]   not a gamer person at all really but these games some of them really hit that spot for me where
[01:27:45.920 --> 01:27:52.560]   they're of interest to me here's that what the call what the call for so fun like yeah they play
[01:27:52.560 --> 01:27:59.360]   that a lot uh it's simple and it's it's cute and it's funny i just wish apple would buy the company
[01:27:59.360 --> 01:28:03.440]   that used to exist that was field runners and then they put field runners on there and then i you know
[01:28:04.240 --> 01:28:10.080]   update a little bit and then well there's no desktop tower defense speaking of uh of companies
[01:28:10.080 --> 01:28:16.240]   that used to exist that had games uh there's another subscription service out there that launched
[01:28:16.240 --> 01:28:23.200]   shortly after apple arcade did it's called game club and what they've done is the the person who
[01:28:23.200 --> 01:28:28.160]   founded game club has gone out and talked to a bunch of different folks who've made games for ios
[01:28:28.160 --> 01:28:35.520]   and has tried to get all of the classic titles uh back onto ios and so with this one service game
[01:28:35.520 --> 01:28:40.000]   club you download the app and you subscribe to it i think you get like a month just like you do with
[01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:46.720]   apple arcade and then you can i think after that it's 4.99 a month but you can play a bunch of old
[01:28:46.720 --> 01:28:54.160]   games uh that were popular on ios it's uh touch arcades eli hodap i'm not sure exactly i pronounce
[01:28:54.160 --> 01:29:01.680]   his last name um but he's been working on this for quite a while uh to bring a bunch of games to
[01:29:01.680 --> 01:29:08.640]   ios that may have uh you know drifted away from the platform over time or no longer available um
[01:29:08.640 --> 01:29:12.480]   i was scrolling through and none of these games are ones that i recognize i have to say
[01:29:12.480 --> 01:29:17.600]   game club dot io yeah they're the classics you know all those ones that you just loved playing
[01:29:17.600 --> 01:29:22.400]   back in the day cursed treasure to you i did use to play sort of i used to play a sort of far
[01:29:22.400 --> 01:29:25.280]   goal that was a pretty fun little game sort of who?
[01:29:25.280 --> 01:29:31.200]   faracle oh okay it sounded like you said sort of faracle which is a dice game that you can play
[01:29:31.200 --> 01:29:37.200]   uh i was like oh a game that's sort of like faracle but not quite hackycat sound familiar to anybody
[01:29:37.200 --> 01:29:43.600]   nope blast i blast mokey too though yeah i remember that back in my day
[01:29:43.600 --> 01:29:52.000]   uh rocket ski racing mr particle man fox versus duck no
[01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:56.400]   uh but apparently these were games that were once popular and they basically wanted to give a
[01:29:56.400 --> 01:30:02.160]   place for them to still exist and be played so yeah you get you can head to game club dot io
[01:30:02.160 --> 01:30:09.120]   and you download this app and play zombie match defense this is like a great way for people who
[01:30:09.120 --> 01:30:15.520]   got into the apple ecosystem after these games were no longer available so they they're they're
[01:30:15.520 --> 01:30:21.120]   gonna get a chance to play them and fall in love with them um i you know i admit that a lot of the
[01:30:21.120 --> 01:30:26.080]   games on that list i didn't recognize but i did play sort of faracle and it was really fun so
[01:30:26.080 --> 01:30:35.280]   i i like this idea sort of um a homage to early ios and and games that you can't play on your
[01:30:35.280 --> 01:30:42.560]   iphone anymore and this could kind of rekindle the the love for it's not quite retro because the
[01:30:42.560 --> 01:30:46.160]   you know it doesn't go back that far but you could almost call this like a
[01:30:46.800 --> 01:30:54.080]   meal retro or post retro um mobile games uh a subscription and you don't have to do what i do
[01:30:54.080 --> 01:30:58.400]   which is like with field runners there's actually a phone that i don't update oh really yeah so
[01:30:58.400 --> 01:31:02.080]   there's a phone that i have in my back in my backpack when i'm when i'm traveling that i don't
[01:31:02.080 --> 01:31:07.200]   update because i can still play field runners on it and um because when i'm on a plane and i have
[01:31:07.200 --> 01:31:13.280]   nothing better i'm waiting for my meal i need to play field runners that's what you have to do so
[01:31:13.280 --> 01:31:19.600]   i wonder so they don't have it there if you're anyway oh field runners uh yes so it's like i don't
[01:31:19.600 --> 01:31:24.080]   even know what you're talking about it's like it's like it's very classic desktop defense and you
[01:31:24.080 --> 01:31:28.480]   don't even know what desktop defense is okay i do yes i have played a few desktop defense games
[01:31:28.480 --> 01:31:33.120]   but not field runners it's the best one so far gotcha the best one and when did it come out
[01:31:33.120 --> 01:31:35.680]   one grandpa
[01:31:36.560 --> 01:31:43.520]   we had a car back in there my niki was in 2010 oh back when i had my teeth
[01:31:43.520 --> 01:31:49.600]   it was i was back there and they had field runners one which was great and field runners two which was
[01:31:49.600 --> 01:31:53.520]   even better and then i did this thing where they tried to get into the hole everyone play each other
[01:31:53.520 --> 01:31:56.560]   and but you can only be connected and i think that was kind of the end of the company because
[01:31:56.560 --> 01:32:01.920]   they only they understood that we didn't want to do that like we just wanted it was like a
[01:32:01.920 --> 01:32:07.920]   time suck you know for when you're oh yep yep yep i can't stop thinking now that episode of
[01:32:07.920 --> 01:32:13.600]   Seinfeld or Costanza like has this frog or machine he wants to keep running only because to preserve
[01:32:13.600 --> 01:32:18.800]   his high score from high school like you've got this one phone that you've got to keep running
[01:32:18.800 --> 01:32:24.160]   because the old way to here's the worst part it's not that i play all of them either i'll play a
[01:32:24.160 --> 01:32:29.040]   level for weeks wow yeah you know just because i'm trying to figure out the best pattern and
[01:32:29.040 --> 01:32:34.400]   and everything else and so it's it's it's i don't know you know that that is legitimately a problem
[01:32:34.400 --> 01:32:43.920]   because imagine imagine if imagine if to uh uh in that the the movie Casablanca would have gone away
[01:32:43.920 --> 01:32:49.200]   unless and there's like there has to be there's a one theater that had like downloaded it and had
[01:32:49.200 --> 01:32:54.160]   disconnected from the internet specifically because otherwise the rights to casa the the license for
[01:32:54.160 --> 01:32:58.960]   Casablanca or the replay whenever the technology will go away and that's what we're facing with
[01:32:58.960 --> 01:33:04.960]   games we have these games that we love that maybe we want to revisit just like uh we might just like
[01:33:04.960 --> 01:33:10.960]   there's so many times where i will totally have forgotten about an album for like 20 25 years
[01:33:10.960 --> 01:33:16.640]   until suddenly for some reason i'm starting for some reason i don't know why for a few a few weeks
[01:33:16.640 --> 01:33:22.720]   ago i suddenly remembered that gang of four album entertainment i really wow i never let i have not
[01:33:22.720 --> 01:33:27.280]   listened to that album in 30 years and i'm listening to it over and over again but now imagine it being
[01:33:27.280 --> 01:33:32.480]   a game where wow that remember that game they used to play like on a console and oh well but now
[01:33:32.480 --> 01:33:37.840]   no one makes it anymore and the hardware doesn't exist anymore and now there's this this this piece
[01:33:37.840 --> 01:33:43.520]   of popular entertainment this piece of creativity simply doesn't exist anymore and never will exist
[01:33:43.520 --> 01:33:49.040]   anymore unless somebody finds a way to distribute it illegally and create it uh created under
[01:33:49.040 --> 01:33:55.920]   emulation so it's we're very we're it's no exactly it's it again this was my actually this is my
[01:33:55.920 --> 01:34:01.120]   pick of the week couple weeks ago which was like an actual a really i haven't i haven't finished
[01:34:01.120 --> 01:34:05.520]   putting it together yet because i've life has gotten in the way but i don't think i don't think
[01:34:05.520 --> 01:34:13.760]   you were here Alex and it were then it uh it bears bears remembering the uh a someone has made like a
[01:34:13.760 --> 01:34:20.240]   gameboy case that holds this is you think that this is like just a game cartridge but no it holds
[01:34:20.240 --> 01:34:27.600]   a raspberry pi w exactly so so so basically the idea is i already have the i already have the
[01:34:27.600 --> 01:34:33.440]   the micro SD card prepared i just haven't put it all together yet so this will have like about
[01:34:33.440 --> 01:34:39.520]   two thousand different games from a whole bunch of different arcade and and coin up and and somehow
[01:34:39.520 --> 01:34:47.600]   and sometimes somehow the feeling is it's not necessarily piracy it's more like we can't allow
[01:34:47.600 --> 01:34:53.280]   Casablanca to die we can't allow the who's quadrifina to die what i haven't don't because if we don't
[01:34:53.280 --> 01:34:57.040]   keep these alive somehow what i haven't what i haven't figured out is when someone's like one
[01:34:57.040 --> 01:35:01.760]   of my pet projects that i've been kind of slowly doing rnd on is one of my favorite games when i
[01:35:01.760 --> 01:35:08.560]   was a kid was tempest and oh yeah yeah yeah yeah so i've been kind of playing with the idea of a very
[01:35:08.560 --> 01:35:15.040]   high-res screen with with but using an editor's shuttle like a really weighted expensive you know
[01:35:15.040 --> 01:35:20.240]   j l cooper you know uh you know for the you know to the control you know so not the cheap one that
[01:35:20.240 --> 01:35:25.920]   was that was in the original game and i was thinking i haven't seen anybody like deck it up you know
[01:35:25.920 --> 01:35:30.560]   like let's take the software and then just make it the most amazing modern experience that you
[01:35:30.560 --> 01:35:36.480]   could make and but it but it but it has to be it has to be either vector or like a laser projection
[01:35:36.480 --> 01:35:42.800]   of the side of a building oh my god that's the only thing that will be okay why did we not do that
[01:35:42.800 --> 01:35:49.600]   already a laser laser on the side okay and we have to talk about the okay we will laser on the side
[01:35:49.600 --> 01:35:54.480]   of a meeting yes well when we when next time we get together we can film the kickstarter video
[01:35:54.480 --> 01:36:00.480]   we talk to you and i we'll get erin maylor involved because he'll he'll have some some ideas there so
[01:36:00.480 --> 01:36:05.920]   we'll figure it out yes uh that's that's exciting i'm looking forward to this laser good meeting
[01:36:05.920 --> 01:36:10.800]   everyone good meeting yeah good let's this is this is a tempest tournament is what it what it should be
[01:36:12.320 --> 01:36:17.760]   those people people will fly people will fly out to say if not not only have we recreated
[01:36:17.760 --> 01:36:23.520]   tepas but we've recreated it on the side of a building yeah here here we've reserved three hotels
[01:36:23.520 --> 01:36:28.880]   that will give you a discount rate the click the look the clear is the the most convenient local
[01:36:28.880 --> 01:36:35.040]   airport is with five ones around shuttle service yes no yeah with the the thing that you miss out
[01:36:35.040 --> 01:36:41.680]   of like classic arcade cabinets is that base that incredible base that just hits like your
[01:36:41.680 --> 01:36:49.920]   spleen and doesn't let go of it until you're out of course did you hear uh that apple it may be
[01:36:49.920 --> 01:36:57.600]   helping to upgrade upgrade the sfo terminal um so i guess united airlines and apple are talking
[01:36:57.600 --> 01:37:04.240]   about updating united's terminal at san francisco united i believe is to put it put some context to
[01:37:04.240 --> 01:37:13.120]   that i believe that united is apples uh airline of choice so it's not it's so it's it what it sounds
[01:37:13.120 --> 01:37:17.360]   like and i have no idea if it's true it sounds like apple is like uh so all of our employees are
[01:37:17.360 --> 01:37:22.560]   going in and out of this terminal and it sucks so we would like to fix this for you you know like so
[01:37:22.560 --> 01:37:29.840]   that so that it's better for our guys which is like that's nice of them ideal for anybody who uses
[01:37:29.840 --> 01:37:35.840]   that terminal that's fantastic fortunately i use it a lot there you go i i just flew out of um i
[01:37:35.840 --> 01:37:43.360]   used to i just flew united out of the sacramento um airport just a month or so ago i had not done
[01:37:43.360 --> 01:37:51.920]   that before it's fancy so united they got they got some fancy terminals so i i think yeah i don't i
[01:37:51.920 --> 01:37:57.680]   haven't been to the one in san francisco but if it's not as nice and fancy and updated is the one in
[01:37:57.680 --> 01:38:01.440]   sacramino then they're behind the times and they need to update it it's fancy for the us
[01:38:01.440 --> 01:38:08.080]   there you go you know i just wanted the only airlines i can take to get like a direct flight to
[01:38:08.080 --> 01:38:16.000]   my midwest homestead um and fly this way too so hey apple go ahead be my guess i mean it would be
[01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:21.280]   nice to have like an international level terminal i mean if you if you connect through something like
[01:38:21.280 --> 01:38:26.880]   singapore you see what a real terminal looks like so it'd be nice to reproduce there is there is no
[01:38:26.880 --> 01:38:32.880]   way to make air travel pleasant i think i think that it's actually a humane thing to make sure that
[01:38:32.880 --> 01:38:37.840]   you don't have this oasis so oh look places to sit down oh look places where people are treating
[01:38:37.840 --> 01:38:42.560]   me like a human being i feel as though that just that's more disruptive when you get back into the
[01:38:42.560 --> 01:38:49.680]   real world of travel where it's like excuse you everybody in group five or six or seven
[01:38:49.680 --> 01:38:54.320]   make sure you stay out of the way of the people that we like we're going to be able to get
[01:38:54.320 --> 01:39:03.040]   coset seats like uh yeah it is it gets a little crummy treat me nice at the at the end of the
[01:39:03.040 --> 01:39:09.440]   journey where i'm not i need to have the sort of like callous the insensitivity to pain still reserved
[01:39:09.440 --> 01:39:16.160]   it's hope it's it's it's the it's the it's the hope that that really destroys you if you have no hope
[01:39:16.160 --> 01:39:20.560]   you'll you'll get through your flight okay particularly if there's a if there's a layover or if you have
[01:39:20.560 --> 01:39:28.800]   to change planes at some point all right we have some picks uh but before we get there i do want to
[01:39:28.800 --> 01:39:37.600]   tell you that uh after the show you can catch math uk anelli in me over on ios today uh we went in
[01:39:37.600 --> 01:39:44.160]   depth with ios 13.2 which you heard a little bit about today uh to talk about all of the features
[01:39:44.160 --> 01:39:49.280]   that are there including some of the series stuff that's coming with or that has come with ios 13.2
[01:39:49.280 --> 01:39:54.080]   and the shortcuts and how they work with home pod math uk anelli is the person to learn all of
[01:39:54.080 --> 01:39:59.840]   that from absolutely so it's uh great as well as an app to help you track air quality in your area
[01:39:59.840 --> 01:40:05.200]   which for those of us here in northern uh california is is a little bit important so for
[01:40:05.200 --> 01:40:13.840]   everything you need for for iPhones iPads Apple watches apple tv all those goodies uh watch ios today
[01:40:13.840 --> 01:40:20.560]   and uh yeah it's gonna be gonna be out soon so check that out all right folks let's go ahead and
[01:40:20.560 --> 01:40:28.160]   move on to our picks of the week i think we'll start with Alex who's here with us in studio so i
[01:40:28.160 --> 01:40:31.760]   i recommended the last version of this piece of hardware but i'm going to recommend the new
[01:40:31.760 --> 01:40:37.680]   version because it's got some key new features so um this is the uh and your combination cost me
[01:40:37.680 --> 01:40:43.120]   seven hundred dollars by the way the last one yeah this one's even yeah so so this is the sound
[01:40:43.120 --> 01:40:49.920]   devices uh mix pre-3 now they make i think three versions of this so the mix pre-3 six and 10
[01:40:49.920 --> 01:40:58.560]   um the three has uh three xlr inputs um it also has a couple other um inputs through ox or you know
[01:40:58.560 --> 01:41:07.680]   an ox in um so this is probably the best recorder uh that you can buy for the price um and and it also
[01:41:07.680 --> 01:41:13.280]   not only records in the field but it is a usb c connection to your computer so you can use this
[01:41:13.280 --> 01:41:19.840]   as the interface to your um to your computer now what what makes this different um than the last
[01:41:19.840 --> 01:41:29.200]   version um is that it has 32 bit float record so that is it's kind of it's it's not new to the audio
[01:41:29.200 --> 01:41:34.720]   industry but i think it's pretty new to uh to mobile recorders okay so if you're recording
[01:41:34.720 --> 01:41:39.280]   a podcast let's say now that and here there's the thing to think about is that if you have
[01:41:39.280 --> 01:41:48.160]   um if you are doing 16 bit most of us record a 16 bit audio um you you have and i can't remember
[01:41:48.160 --> 01:41:52.800]   all these numbers exactly so i'm just going to give you general numbers okay but it is something
[01:41:52.800 --> 01:41:59.600]   like negative uh i think it's negative 80 or something or negative 60 to 0 um is what your
[01:41:59.600 --> 01:42:05.680]   range is so if you go over 0 you peak we've all had digital um distortion right when we peak
[01:42:05.680 --> 01:42:10.160]   if you go negative if you do 24 bit audio which has been around for a long time i think it's
[01:42:10.160 --> 01:42:18.080]   negative 44 negative 144 to 0 so then you peak again when you because and then part of
[01:42:18.080 --> 01:42:23.280]   this is the because we're using integer rather than float right so when you go to 32 bit uh you
[01:42:23.280 --> 01:42:28.640]   get now you have um and then you put float in which means it now has decimals and exponentials
[01:42:28.640 --> 01:42:38.640]   you now go from negatives i believe it's 744 wow 2 plus 750 or 760 or whatever on both ends so
[01:42:38.640 --> 01:42:45.440]   you're dealing with almost 1500 uh db of range and it goes into the plus area which means you don't
[01:42:45.440 --> 01:42:52.640]   need a limiter if you can so so like we we had limiters because we had 16 and 24 when you can just
[01:42:52.640 --> 01:42:59.040]   record into that into that range you don't need a limiter and so 32 bit 32 bit float means that it
[01:42:59.040 --> 01:43:07.120]   is uh you can peak the mic but you can't peak the recorder now it doesn't necessarily do that out
[01:43:07.120 --> 01:43:12.080]   of the out of the um the usb to your computer so if you're passing that through uh and that has to
[01:43:12.080 --> 01:43:18.240]   do with i i believe some um it's more of the os than it has to do with the recorder um but the recorder
[01:43:18.240 --> 01:43:26.560]   will um go way into the uh and and yes someone posted the zoom f6 does the same thing but the
[01:43:26.560 --> 01:43:34.080]   difference between the zoom f6 um and the uh mix pre three or six or whatever are the preamps so
[01:43:34.080 --> 01:43:39.680]   the other thing about what makes your audio is kind of your your mic but a lot of it is the preamp
[01:43:39.680 --> 01:43:45.280]   and so the best preamps um built into any any recorders are the sound devices ones they actually
[01:43:45.280 --> 01:43:50.720]   used to OEM them and then ended up making their own they designed their own so uh the noise floor on
[01:43:50.720 --> 01:43:58.560]   the on the um uh on the sound devices i believe is like negative 128 or something which is really
[01:43:58.560 --> 01:44:06.960]   quiet so uh what you end up with is a um uh a super quiet preamp that that also can't be peaked
[01:44:07.760 --> 01:44:13.280]   in a very small piece that also has top and bottom mounting so you can put it underneath your camera
[01:44:13.280 --> 01:44:18.000]   you know and do all the you know so you can attach it under your camera and use this as your field
[01:44:18.000 --> 01:44:23.200]   recorder as you're recording something to your camera you can pass the audio in for reference
[01:44:23.200 --> 01:44:28.880]   but but but get the great audio on this little uh on this little guy and so it that's what but what
[01:44:28.880 --> 01:44:34.800]   distinguishes it um again from the zoom version is the preamp so i mean that you know and a lot
[01:44:34.800 --> 01:44:41.360]   of other things all the circuitry and everything else it's and so uh the um you're not going to
[01:44:41.360 --> 01:44:46.400]   get something better in the field than this as far as uh recording quality they have some bigger
[01:44:46.400 --> 01:44:52.880]   you know recorders that are out there um sound devices make some um Scorpio and the 888 and 833
[01:44:52.880 --> 01:44:59.040]   um but the for someone doing podcasting i can't imagine something better than what in practical
[01:44:59.040 --> 01:45:05.120]   terms you're recording your podcast you accidentally set it way too low you know or or way too high
[01:45:05.120 --> 01:45:09.600]   and you can always go back and recover that that content that's so important you know and so
[01:45:09.600 --> 01:45:13.840]   and in one person might be a little lower on their mic than the other people are and you can
[01:45:13.840 --> 01:45:20.880]   always go back you have all that data that's there um and so it's just an incredible um incredible
[01:45:20.880 --> 01:45:25.840]   piece of hardware how's it powered uh this is power you can power it you have a variety of different
[01:45:25.840 --> 01:45:32.560]   battery packs this one is a um this is does uh double a okay batteries you need to do high quality
[01:45:32.560 --> 01:45:38.720]   double a's it does pull a lot of um you do SD card is the record um and you can also power it via
[01:45:38.720 --> 01:45:45.520]   USB C excellent so um and so all of those work and this is the thin the thin version uh you can
[01:45:45.520 --> 01:45:50.000]   also get a thicker version that has holds more batteries um it is nice to have one that uses
[01:45:50.000 --> 01:45:53.680]   double a because you can use rechargeable double a's so you can still be nice about it but it is
[01:45:53.680 --> 01:45:57.440]   nice to be able to walk into a store and you know somewhere in the world and get them and not
[01:45:57.440 --> 01:46:01.840]   have to recharge like when you're in the field so so anyway that's my that's my pick i think that it's
[01:46:01.840 --> 01:46:07.280]   um uh they've um definitely just keep on making these these little guys better and and you still
[01:46:07.280 --> 01:46:14.800]   like the i love it this is i see the i will see all the reasons for all the reasons that you say
[01:46:14.800 --> 01:46:21.520]   but i will say that another uh among the lesser reasons why i really like it he said he said trying
[01:46:21.520 --> 01:46:28.400]   to make sure he doesn't absolutely unplug it is uh when you speak uh it has these really cool
[01:46:28.400 --> 01:46:35.840]   VU meters and i kind of it's it's so a i have absolute i can i have reassurance that my i'm getting
[01:46:35.840 --> 01:46:41.200]   audio and stuff like that when i'm using it as a field recorder all i have to do is press this
[01:46:41.200 --> 01:46:47.840]   button that's mark rec and everything that i say will be recorded and also i will see this really
[01:46:47.840 --> 01:46:54.640]   cool visual cue that yes you you didn't imagine it you are actually recording audio uh and i was i
[01:46:54.640 --> 01:47:01.200]   got to say that i did gulp at the i they they sent me one they let me borrow one for a month and i
[01:47:01.200 --> 01:47:05.680]   use that that thing that you get to do as a tech journalist which is i'm kind of i'm gonna write
[01:47:05.680 --> 01:47:10.640]   about it definitely for sure but i'm also going to get to like try it out before i actually commit
[01:47:10.640 --> 01:47:16.160]   to a lot of money to spend on this and oh my god everything that you said is absolutely right for
[01:47:16.160 --> 01:47:22.000]   if you're a podcaster and you're at the point where you're making money of at it so that you have some
[01:47:22.000 --> 01:47:28.480]   you have a budget for this and also you are very very aware of your problems that you keep facing
[01:47:28.480 --> 01:47:33.760]   as someone has to podcast in lots of different situations it's it's it's not a small amount of
[01:47:33.760 --> 01:47:39.920]   money but the great thing is that it solves every problem that i've ever had as a podcaster where
[01:47:39.920 --> 01:47:45.440]   whether it's just as simple as i'm at my desk but i need a really good and long digital converter
[01:47:45.440 --> 01:47:50.800]   and i also need to be able to adjust what my level is and also the microphone level at my
[01:47:50.800 --> 01:47:57.120]   at my earphone level but also when i'm in the i'm uh i'm uh interviewing someone for a podcast and i
[01:47:57.120 --> 01:48:02.080]   need to have two or three microphone set up and i need to be able to not to do that without necessarily
[01:48:02.080 --> 01:48:08.400]   having to carry uh having to carry a laptop with me uh it's just absolutely perfect and absolutely
[01:48:08.400 --> 01:48:16.400]   wonderful it's it's uh the thing is a lot of the tools that you use for your job or for your really
[01:48:16.400 --> 01:48:22.000]   intense hobby they cost a lot of money but you know that you made the right choice if after
[01:48:22.000 --> 01:48:25.520]   you've been using it for a couple weeks you've totally forgotten about how much you spent on it
[01:48:25.520 --> 01:48:31.520]   because this is this is the perfect tool for the job it's saving you so much aggravation so much
[01:48:31.520 --> 01:48:37.600]   problems that like oh well that's nice i just i just spoke to the CEO of this company for 90
[01:48:37.600 --> 01:48:42.000]   minutes and i thought it was recording but oh well i wonder i wonder if he'll give me another
[01:48:42.000 --> 01:48:47.520]   90 minutes of time to talk to talk on the record oh well and you know and it's not it's not it's not
[01:48:47.520 --> 01:48:52.400]   or just uh there was a comment in the in the thing about is this kill my this scorpio premium there
[01:48:52.400 --> 01:48:58.400]   does this kill my scorpio premium portable mixer recorders mince 360 uh talked about the score this
[01:48:58.400 --> 01:49:03.440]   is a completely different thing the scorpio is a is there kind of their uh high-end flagship so
[01:49:03.440 --> 01:49:09.360]   the thing about the scorpio is it's kind of the mac pro version of you know it's a ten thousand
[01:49:09.360 --> 01:49:16.320]   dollar recorder that that does deal everything like it has it's got dante built in and it's got um
[01:49:16.320 --> 01:49:21.360]   you know a lot of extra routing and you know and a thousand other things you know things that are
[01:49:21.360 --> 01:49:28.000]   built if you are a if you work in hollywood and you are recording movies that's what you that's what
[01:49:28.000 --> 01:49:33.840]   you use if you're if you are doing you know if you're mostly video or or you're doing podcasts or
[01:49:33.840 --> 01:49:37.680]   you're you want to integrate this with your you know with the things you're building a whole
[01:49:37.680 --> 01:49:43.680]   mix pre-line is it's also just much easier to use the interface for the scorpio is is built for
[01:49:43.680 --> 01:49:47.680]   professional and so there's just a lot more options and they get you know it's deeper into that into
[01:49:47.680 --> 01:49:52.720]   that process the mix pre-line is really streamlined for folks like us that want to just record stuff
[01:49:52.720 --> 01:49:59.760]   there and so anyway um yeah and i really feel like sound devices is kind of the apple of of sound
[01:49:59.760 --> 01:50:04.480]   recording so you can also use it as an iPod so that you save some more money there you can
[01:50:04.480 --> 01:50:08.880]   record never thought of like listening using it as an iPod but i guess you can go there you go
[01:50:08.880 --> 01:50:16.480]   there you go all right that is an excellent pick and lori it is time for you to share yours i can't
[01:50:16.480 --> 01:50:23.920]   i can't follow that well you're gonna have to i'm sorry to say okay so keeping with my theme for
[01:50:23.920 --> 01:50:29.520]   the month of horror films for halloween i actually managed to get one more horror film in it just
[01:50:29.520 --> 01:50:35.440]   came out it's called the lighthouse and it's by roger uh rubber eggers who also made the movie the
[01:50:35.440 --> 01:50:42.640]   witch so if you liked the witch you understand the weirdness that you're gonna see when you watch the
[01:50:42.640 --> 01:50:48.880]   white house the lighthouse sorry um i i can tell you i just watched it last night and
[01:50:48.880 --> 01:50:58.320]   i recommend it but i honestly can't tell yet if i like it it's that weird it's just weird you are
[01:50:58.320 --> 01:51:07.520]   just taken on this crazy roller coaster ride of madness and these two men at a light in a lighthouse
[01:51:07.520 --> 01:51:15.840]   you know and i don't know what i watched it's that intense and and confusing but purposeful so
[01:51:15.840 --> 01:51:22.480]   i recommend watching it if you like to the witch you understand the concept that that this guy does
[01:51:22.480 --> 01:51:27.360]   things out of the ordinary so be prepared for something really weird and really unusual will
[01:51:27.360 --> 01:51:33.920]   end of foes performance is absolutely extraordinary and there's there are only two speaking parts in
[01:51:33.920 --> 01:51:38.720]   this movie there's two men speaking that's it there's six people in the movie all together
[01:51:38.720 --> 01:51:44.640]   and four of them are just glancing characters that don't ever speak so it's them it's just the
[01:51:44.640 --> 01:51:50.800]   two of them this whole time it's intense i definitely if you can handle the weirdness of it i definitely
[01:51:50.800 --> 01:51:58.480]   recommend go watch it in the theater it's also um it's filmed on i it's a square not not actual
[01:51:58.480 --> 01:52:05.920]   square i think it's like um it's definitely a different uh um film format which i can't see right now
[01:52:05.920 --> 01:52:12.240]   what what it is but it's weird it's so it shows up on on the screen where it's it's black on the
[01:52:12.240 --> 01:52:19.760]   edges but it's tall so it's uh it's very unique four by three there you go yeah thank you and uh
[01:52:19.760 --> 01:52:25.200]   and all in black and white and like that sort of like not it's like the shiny black and white the
[01:52:25.200 --> 01:52:33.040]   one that's more um like a monotone type look so definitely i'm looking at some places to go see
[01:52:33.040 --> 01:52:40.640]   this and i do have to put it out there it's very weird so you know if you are if you don't like
[01:52:40.640 --> 01:52:46.880]   weird movies or if you if you want a story that tells the beginning middle and end don't see this
[01:52:46.880 --> 01:52:51.840]   because it it won't satisfy that in you but if you like things that are uh you know kind of awkward
[01:52:51.840 --> 01:52:57.040]   and weird there's not a lot of it's not horror like there's not um there's no jump scares and there's
[01:52:57.040 --> 01:53:02.720]   not a lot of um gore anything like that it's really the horror of it is the horror of these two men
[01:53:02.720 --> 01:53:08.320]   and they're spiraling to madness so whoa i kind of feel like it's like if you like the naked lunch
[01:53:08.320 --> 01:53:15.840]   you're like yeah yeah yeah it's even weirder than that but yes that's definitely down the right path
[01:53:15.840 --> 01:53:24.320]   definitely yeah i think i like it yeah all right well that is uh i really think i'm gonna have to this
[01:53:24.320 --> 01:53:29.360]   thursday is the soonest that i can see it if i don't want to travel watch it for Halloween
[01:53:29.360 --> 01:53:34.480]   just to just to riff off of that for one one moment is i yesterday the school's out because of the
[01:53:34.480 --> 01:53:39.200]   all the power my kids were off school and i just gotten back from india so i just we decided to go
[01:53:39.200 --> 01:53:45.440]   to see dobe the dobe cinemas right now are showing wizard of ayes in the dobe
[01:53:45.440 --> 01:53:52.560]   cinemas that are spread around the us pretty awesome that is awesome yeah it doesn't take full
[01:53:52.560 --> 01:53:58.800]   advantage of the dynamic range of the of the thing but it's the best screening you are ever
[01:53:58.800 --> 01:54:05.120]   gonna see of the wizard of ayes oh that's and um i like the wizard of ayes uh are there any theaters
[01:54:05.120 --> 01:54:09.920]   where you can are there any theaters where you could see uh wizard of ayes and judy as a double bill
[01:54:09.920 --> 01:54:15.120]   because i think that's that would be worth twenty i wonder if that was the timing for it why it came
[01:54:15.120 --> 01:54:20.080]   out because you did you did make me when i saw the wizard of ayes i really wanted to see judy now
[01:54:20.080 --> 01:54:24.480]   because it's just like wow that was like a magical moment for her at that moment you know in that
[01:54:24.480 --> 01:54:31.520]   movie and um yeah didn't last all right it's andi and atko what's your pick
[01:54:32.960 --> 01:54:39.760]   uh it's a pick and a kind of a reminder i finally dropped off my my 2015 macbook pro it had the
[01:54:39.760 --> 01:54:46.240]   screen delamination problem also known as stain gate it's where the the the the top surface that was
[01:54:46.240 --> 01:54:52.800]   supposed to be sort of anti glare wasn't adhered very very well and as a result over time it became
[01:54:52.800 --> 01:55:00.080]   my screen almost like just this year started i get these like sort of like cloudy spots on it
[01:55:00.080 --> 01:55:04.800]   as though there is like a grease stains on it that that that i couldn't scrub off or wipe off
[01:55:04.800 --> 01:55:10.400]   and it's because that very very top layer that he just was starting to become unstuck and so apple
[01:55:10.400 --> 01:55:19.040]   had a problem decided finally to extend warranty repairs uh for this particular problem and uh if
[01:55:19.040 --> 01:55:26.480]   you have bought a certain certain models of macbook as late as early 17 macbook pros uh macbook
[01:55:26.480 --> 01:55:33.200]   nothing's again it goes all the way from 2013 up to 2017 uh for for within four years from the date
[01:55:33.200 --> 01:55:38.560]   of purchase they will fix the screen for free but you have to get it in within that's my screen
[01:55:38.560 --> 01:55:44.480]   that's how bad it was it was it was so bad that with this with this guy now obviously i adjusted
[01:55:44.480 --> 01:55:48.400]   the light so to make it as apparent as possible but it was a sort of thing where when i'm adjusting
[01:55:48.400 --> 01:55:53.520]   things in photoshop i'm like wow there was a lot of noise in those highlights boy what did i
[01:55:53.520 --> 01:55:59.360]   know no it's because my screen has these stupid like cloudy blotches on it uh and so but again
[01:55:59.360 --> 01:56:03.840]   four years within the date of purchase i was i had made this appointment to drop it off because
[01:56:03.840 --> 01:56:10.160]   uh for like three times and create and cancel it because uh my macbook pro is my daily driver mac
[01:56:10.160 --> 01:56:15.440]   and so you can imagine how hard it is to create a circumstance on which i can do without it for
[01:56:15.440 --> 01:56:20.720]   about a week uh but finally i finally was it was it was it was it was hitting me in the face that
[01:56:21.520 --> 01:56:26.400]   at that this deadline was coming up so i got it in within like with 10 days to spare but yes
[01:56:26.400 --> 01:56:31.520]   they're going to fix the entire they're going to fix the whole screen for free no no cost necessary
[01:56:31.520 --> 01:56:37.040]   uh the other thing you need but uh but the other upside of this is that the according to the uh
[01:56:37.040 --> 01:56:42.320]   the apples support doc even if if there are other problems with the display because they have to
[01:56:42.320 --> 01:56:46.640]   replace the display if there's a if there's like a crack in the corner of the screen well guess what
[01:56:46.640 --> 01:56:50.720]   they're going to be repairing that for free as well because they can't just re-lam it they can't just
[01:56:50.720 --> 01:56:55.760]   like put a new layer of of of anti-glare on it and re-adhere it so you'll get all that stuff for free
[01:56:55.760 --> 01:57:02.640]   too and also uh just the general stuff where when you send you can't you can't just hand over your
[01:57:02.640 --> 01:57:07.680]   math book and say find whatever it is that there might be problems with it i don't know i don't know
[01:57:07.680 --> 01:57:13.040]   about and fix them for free if you can but the thing is when you when you do have your mac in for
[01:57:13.040 --> 01:57:17.760]   service for a specific issue they might you may might come back and say oh by the way when we had
[01:57:17.760 --> 01:57:21.440]   it open we noticed that one of your one of the cells of your battery was bulging a little bit
[01:57:21.440 --> 01:57:26.000]   so we replaced the battery or we noticed there was a ding here that is something that we're
[01:57:26.000 --> 01:57:30.560]   we're only that we were able to cover for free so we covered that for free uh so but uh but more
[01:57:30.560 --> 01:57:34.480]   than anything else realize that you have four years from the date of purchase to get this fixed
[01:57:34.480 --> 01:57:41.360]   for people who like me who bought like an early 2015 MacBook Pro 13 inch that is probably going to
[01:57:41.360 --> 01:57:46.240]   be you've probably already lost out if you didn't get it done by now i bought mine in November
[01:57:46.240 --> 01:57:51.760]   so i was still in under the wire but definitely you want to get that done if you they you can't
[01:57:51.760 --> 01:57:56.960]   just have it done uh just in case you there have to be i think visible signs that there are these
[01:57:56.960 --> 01:58:02.480]   problems i think uh but believe we believe me again mine was fine for three years and then suddenly
[01:58:02.480 --> 01:58:06.960]   it's just all went south at once so definitely know about that there's a link to us if you do if
[01:58:06.960 --> 01:58:12.400]   you do a google search for stain gate you'll get all the details but you don't need to quote anything
[01:58:12.400 --> 01:58:18.720]   i was just able to just from just a file in normal appointment with a genius bar and say that my
[01:58:18.720 --> 01:58:24.800]   my screen looks all scummy the i think that that i got the delamination problem just came in on a
[01:58:24.800 --> 01:58:30.960]   came in on a on a monday dropped it off and so it got the the it's still out it's still up being
[01:58:30.960 --> 01:58:34.480]   repaired but our r r had been told that here's the standard here's what's going to cost and here's
[01:58:34.480 --> 01:58:40.560]   the cost to me is going to be zero so definitely get that done uh if you're seeing any signs of that
[01:58:40.560 --> 01:58:44.080]   even if you're not seeing any signs of that you may as well take your luck and see if it's a little
[01:58:44.080 --> 01:58:50.160]   parrot uh preemptively but i don't know if that'll happen but again be aware that uh that uh this
[01:58:50.160 --> 01:58:53.920]   can happen to you if you're one of the effective models if you do a search for skin stain gate
[01:58:53.920 --> 01:58:58.880]   you'll find out which models are affected well speaking of being aware that is actually my pick
[01:58:58.880 --> 01:59:08.240]   of the week um it is called the aware a w a ir uh second edition of this product and i don't have
[01:59:08.240 --> 01:59:16.640]   with me because it's currently doing its duty in my home right now uh this is a a air quality
[01:59:16.640 --> 01:59:22.560]   sensor uh it's beautiful and that it is you know like this nice wood it looks like a what like a
[01:59:22.560 --> 01:59:30.000]   mid-century modern speaker or something like that um but it is a multi-sensor for your air that tracks
[01:59:30.800 --> 01:59:38.960]   dust chemicals co2 um what else does it do temperature humidity and a few other things
[01:59:38.960 --> 01:59:44.160]   and will alert you there's there's all the options temperature humidity co2 dust and chemicals uh
[01:59:44.160 --> 01:59:49.920]   and will alert you when those things are raising and lowering and uh or anywhere in between so it
[01:59:49.920 --> 01:59:56.800]   gives you an overall score uh that it shows on this the the display is kind of an led display that
[01:59:56.800 --> 02:00:02.640]   shines through this perforated uh white uh portion at the front of the screen and then each of these
[02:00:02.640 --> 02:00:10.480]   little bars actually it's it's dots from one to five and however far up those are are uh relative
[02:00:10.480 --> 02:00:17.200]   to each of the scores so temperature humidity co2 chemicals and fine dust and i have this running
[02:00:17.200 --> 02:00:22.160]   in my home i have two small dogs with tiny little or with tiny little respiratory systems and so
[02:00:22.160 --> 02:00:31.680]   i try to keep track while we've got these fires going on and right now um the what is it parts per
[02:00:31.680 --> 02:00:38.080]   million uh in my home or at 83 which is relative it's kind of hard to see from here but it's
[02:00:38.080 --> 02:00:45.840]   relatively high but not so high uh as it has been in the past uh in fact last night it was about 140
[02:00:46.480 --> 02:00:53.120]   which is not great i've got an air purifier running um but there's still uh it's been up in the red for
[02:00:53.120 --> 02:00:59.840]   quite a while now and it's just a handy thing to see um how things are going in the home while i'm
[02:00:59.840 --> 02:01:05.840]   away and while i'm there too so that i can make adjustments based on that uh this is the second
[02:01:05.840 --> 02:01:12.160]   addition as i said of the product and it's kind of silly but if you knock on the top of the device
[02:01:12.160 --> 02:01:17.360]   twice then it'll also show you the current time so it's not just an air quality sensor can also
[02:01:17.360 --> 02:01:22.400]   give you the current time it lets out little chimes to let you know when things are changing
[02:01:22.400 --> 02:01:30.000]   and it can pair with different devices to provide the information to them so you can ask booboo
[02:01:30.000 --> 02:01:37.600]   whichever booboo you use be it from amazon google or apple um how the current air quality is
[02:01:38.640 --> 02:01:44.960]   it's available for it is a little pricey it's a hundred seventy five dollars on amazon um it does
[02:01:44.960 --> 02:01:53.360]   it does more tracking in one device than a lot of the air quality sensors that i've used
[02:01:53.360 --> 02:01:58.320]   and one place where it does stand out too is how it looks it's one of the best looking air quality
[02:01:58.320 --> 02:02:04.000]   sensors uh that i've used so if that's something like you want to have it out in the middle of your
[02:02:04.000 --> 02:02:09.200]   living room or or you know sort of serving its purpose as a way to track the air quality in a
[02:02:09.200 --> 02:02:14.400]   given room it's kind of nice um as someone in the chat is saying you might want to move to
[02:02:14.400 --> 02:02:22.960]   shins and for the cleaner air uh too entirely true uh in fact but yeah that's the aware second
[02:02:22.960 --> 02:02:32.160]   generation and that folks is the end of another episode of mac break weekly of course we uh are
