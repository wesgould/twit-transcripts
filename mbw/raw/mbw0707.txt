[00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:27.360]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly, the show we cover the latest news from Apple,
[00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.640]   which is going to be harder and harder to come by, I think. But
[00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:37.120]   never the less. We got something. We're going to gather the gang.
[00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:44.320]   Space is so limited in this monitor. We're doing this out of the old studio and the old style.
[00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:51.200]   The impalting style. I'm the vanilla. Yeah, you're the vanilla. Yeah, it's
[00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:56.640]   Spamoni. Actually, that works because Laura's pink. I don't know how chocolate Renee can be,
[00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:04.720]   but it's like Moose color. I'm going to screw it all up. I do the Brady Bunch thing. Now you have
[00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:10.240]   to wave down and look down at each other and up in sideways. This is the crew. This week,
[00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:15.440]   we're going to rotate through the hosts until the end of this event. But before we do much,
[00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:21.280]   we should probably say, first of all, hello, Laurie Gill. I'm more.com. We're here.
[00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:27.120]   New responsibilities have expanded considerably, but we'll talk about that in a second. Great to
[00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:30.960]   have you. Are you still officially managing editor or do you have another title now?
[00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:34.560]   Currently, I'm still officially managing editor. Because if they gave you a title,
[00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:40.400]   they'd have to give you a raise. Andy and the Enoco is also here. WGBH Boston.
[00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:45.360]   Good to have you. And they're all ensconced as they always have. There's no difference at all.
[00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:50.320]   In their home studios. And Renee Richie's here. And now I'm going to have to change your lower
[00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:56.640]   third. I think Renee Richie. It did say I'm more.com. But Renee, tell us the news.
[00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:03.760]   Yeah, I'm no longer with I'm more as of this week. I've gone indie independent, not like Indiana
[00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:10.800]   Jones and the last crusade, but just independent. It is like Indiana Jones and last crusade because
[00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:17.280]   you're that bad a something something. So I probably shouldn't put that all in caps. Looks like I'm
[00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:27.360]   shouting. But I am YouTube. So what are you going to do on this channel? I'm going to do daily news
[00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:31.040]   analysis. So it's not going to be like breaking news stuff. I want to take a little bit of time
[00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:35.120]   and really delve into the stories and tell you not just like what's happening and when it's
[00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:38.800]   happening, but why it's happening and how it's going to affect you. And then once a week, I'm going
[00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:44.720]   to try and do a deeper dive either on a product or on a big story and sort of feel my way out as I go.
[00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:51.120]   Yeah, I mean, that's that's the way to do it. It's really about personality on YouTube. And so
[00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:56.320]   it isn't it's not going to be all Apple either. It's going to be like a lot of Apple because that's
[00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:59.760]   just what I've covered for the last 10 years. But I want to also make sure I touch on everything
[00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:04.400]   else that's happening. It's challenging because YouTube hates people who have multiple lanes these
[00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:08.720]   days. They really want you to pick one and you better not mention COVID-19 or this. Suddenly
[00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:13.920]   demonetize you. Yeah, I mean, I've been doing that anyway because I feel like it's important
[00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:18.160]   and YouTube will get its act together eventually. But I have like this Aaron, I said it in the video,
[00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:23.520]   I had this Aaron Sorkinesque romantic attachment to doing news and telling a story well. I want to
[00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:29.600]   see you just how far I can I can move that. Let's let's play just a little bit of the oh, we could
[00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:37.120]   play the whole thing. It's not that long of the introductory video. This is youtube.com/ReneRitchie.
[00:04:37.120 --> 00:05:06.000]   I'm Rene Ritchie. And this. This. This. This. This. This. And this. This. And this. This. This. This. And this. And this. This. This. This. This. This. And this. And this. Is my brand new YouTube channel. Nice. I'm fascinated by Apple. I've been covering the company since the launch of the original
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:26.000]   iPhone and they've just come to touch so many aspects of our culture, our relationships, our lives. They've also become the lens through which many of us experienced the rest of consumer technology as well. From Google to Microsoft, Facebook, Twitter, Amazon and more. I also love the news. I have a Sorkinesque romantic ideal about how facts
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:55.960]   righteously presented can inform and empower us. I spent the first 10 years of my career in product marketing, learning how tech companies position their products and their problems from the inside. I spent the last 10 years in tech media, learning how those products and those problems affect all of us. Now, I want to spend the next 10 years right here with you, talking not just about Apple, glorified or vilified, but about all the tech that affects all of our lives. And not just about the news.
[00:05:55.960 --> 00:06:25.880]   About what's happening and when, but diving deep into the analysis behind it, the how, the why. Most importantly, I want to start a new conversation with you about what's real and what's not, what's fact and what's not, what's serious and meant to help and educate us. And what's just sensationalism desperate to manipulate and exploit us. It all starts here with this brand new channel and a brand new daily analysis show because that's just what I do. But I also have a few other exciting new projects coming up that I really
[00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:55.800]   can't wait to share with you. And here's where you all come in. I'm starting fresh, starting over, building this all back up from the ground up. And I really need your help to do it. So please hit subscribe and set that bell gizmo to always. It's really the only way YouTube will actually tell you when each and every new episode goes live. Share this new channel with everyone you know so we can get this all going again and fast and then drop a comment below letting me know just exactly what you want to see next as we take
[00:06:55.800 --> 00:07:01.080]   all this live. Thanks to everyone for collabing and all of you for your support. Now don't take
[00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:06.280]   don't take me down for running that. I hope you won't take no no no strikes. Okay. I'm a
[00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:13.480]   believer in the open web. I have to I have to say it's really refreshing to read YouTube comments
[00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:21.160]   and they're all nice. They're all saying congrats. Well done. This is a unique experience on YouTube
[00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:49.320]   for me. So well done. Clearly you got a lot of goodwill. I didn't realize you'd been I'm more 11 years. Wow. Yeah, it goes fast. Yeah. Man. How long have you been with us? Oh, I don't even know it's been a while. Yeah, the 15th anniversary of the network is in two weeks is April 19. But I think anniversary. Thank you. And we've been doing Macbreak weekly when I started almost as long anyway.
[00:07:50.760 --> 00:07:53.160]   Gosh, I'm so happy for you, Renee. Oh, thank you.
[00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:58.760]   Is this what you want the lower third to say YouTube.com slash Renee Richie? Oh, that's great. Yeah. Thank you so much. And thank you, Andy.
[00:07:58.760 --> 00:08:05.320]   And I smash the bell. Ding the button. Hit the red subscribe. Do all the things.
[00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:20.680]   It's weird to say and people ask you why you say it. But what's what happened with YouTube and it happened with Facebook too is because of the algorithm they discovered quickly that people who subscribe don't actually watch every video. So they stopped showing every video to people who subscribe. And then those people think you're not putting out videos anymore.
[00:08:20.680 --> 00:08:36.480]   Right. Like this horrible catch 22. So everyone's left on a street corner. Now you have a million people on street court are going here. You hear you read all about it. And it's terrible. So if you actually do want to see all the videos, you have to not only turn on notifications, but say like, don't pick and choose for me. Let me know when new videos go up.
[00:08:36.480 --> 00:08:46.080]   Actually, honestly, the only brave thing that's happening here because Renee, you've long deserved this. And it's the smart thing to do is you trusting YouTube, but you're a brave fellow.
[00:08:46.080 --> 00:09:02.280]   And okay. People don't like so I'm putting a podcast feed up for the audio for people who just don't like to watch video. That's nice. And it's going to be on Nebula too. And they don't have any ads or anything. So it'll be up there. Probably the night before it goes up on YouTube.
[00:09:02.280 --> 00:09:12.600]   That's good. And so there'll be audio only as an RSS feed and then I'll be on video. Okay. Absolutely. That is on YouTube. And you mentioned we at Lisa called you yesterday and we talked a little bit.
[00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:21.000]   Yes, she was so great. Thank you so much. Well, we were really happy for you. I appreciate it. But you mentioned you may also be from time to time submitting articles to Lori for her to red pencil.
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:27.120]   Yeah, I'm doing a column. She's she hasn't gotten rid of me. What a column. Yeah. What is that going to be about?
[00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:36.800]   It's I'm doing the full on Jason Snell. It's like when he left Mackerel and you know, like he inspired me with this, he kept doing a column because it's just it's nice to sort of keep your toe in the water.
[00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:42.080]   And I'm going to do I think Lori said Friday. So every Friday I'm going to make sure I have a column. That's very generous of her.
[00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:44.080]   Yeah.
[00:09:44.080 --> 00:09:49.840]   Also, it's also it's who needs him.
[00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:58.280]   Also also as content director of I'm more. It's double you. Good idea. A you get you get Rene Richie content and probably a good bargain.
[00:09:58.280 --> 00:10:04.080]   And secondly, it means that you don't have Rene Richie as a competitor now. Good point. Good point.
[00:10:04.080 --> 00:10:11.480]   Keep your friends close and your enemies closer. That's for sure. So Lori, are you taking over Rene's duties and I'm more?
[00:10:11.480 --> 00:10:22.480]   Well, Renee's duties at I'm more have been really hyper focused on vector. So there's no way that I could possibly compete with how amazing he was with vector.
[00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:29.480]   So what happens to the sector? We're we're putting out on hold for now, but I think you will be able to look out for new vector stuff.
[00:10:29.480 --> 00:10:36.480]   It's not going to be Rene type stuff because nobody can be as good as Rene. We don't really have anything official in place right now.
[00:10:36.480 --> 00:10:43.480]   But, you know, if you keep it subscribed, we will bring the channel back up eventually. We just have to figure out what we're going to do in its place.
[00:10:43.480 --> 00:10:48.480]   So we're, you know, we got some ideas going, some talent that we're looking at could be kind of a big deal.
[00:10:48.480 --> 00:10:53.480]   And I'm more you keep all the lights and the cameras and the gym, right, Renee? It looks like the same studio.
[00:10:53.480 --> 00:10:57.480]   I've been wondering why you've been fixing this up so much. I know I get it.
[00:10:57.480 --> 00:11:03.480]   Well, I just I built my own studio because I always I always hated the idea of of using other people's stuff.
[00:11:03.480 --> 00:11:06.480]   It just always felt weird to me and I always thought it'd be good if I had skin in the game.
[00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:10.480]   And it's useful because I get it's in my my house. I can still do it.
[00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:14.480]   As all our network TV anchors are finding out, you know, it takes a lot to set up things in your house.
[00:11:14.480 --> 00:11:18.480]   And I can I can still use everything that I put together, which is great.
[00:11:18.480 --> 00:11:20.480]   Congratulations. It's really great. We're glad. Yes.
[00:11:20.480 --> 00:11:23.480]   You will continue with us of court, right? Thank you.
[00:11:23.480 --> 00:11:27.480]   Yeah, as long as you have me. I forgot to ask.
[00:11:27.480 --> 00:11:30.480]   Now that we're competitors, it's about to be out the door.
[00:11:30.480 --> 00:11:37.480]   No, yeah. And as I mentioned, just because I'm doing it from this studio now, I don't have the same capability.
[00:11:37.480 --> 00:11:42.480]   We're going to we we tried it last week to have four people in the box and it was just it was too many.
[00:11:42.480 --> 00:11:47.480]   So we're going to rotate through you. So Alex will be back next week.
[00:11:47.480 --> 00:11:50.480]   One of I don't know how Carson is setting this up. One of you.
[00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:53.480]   Is he flipping a coin? I don't know. He said musical chairs.
[00:11:53.480 --> 00:11:56.480]   Whoever sits down the fastest. He's back on his bike.
[00:11:56.480 --> 00:12:02.480]   Hey, there's another story, big story that just broke while we were doing iOS today.
[00:12:02.480 --> 00:12:07.480]   And it actually is a little disheartening. Apple has bought dark sky.
[00:12:07.480 --> 00:12:13.480]   That was a shocker dark sky, which is my favorite weather app.
[00:12:13.480 --> 00:12:18.480]   And it was on Android dark sky in their blog post said,
[00:12:18.480 --> 00:12:22.480]   Hey, yeah, we're not going to be on Android anymore.
[00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:29.480]   And starting in July 1st, but even more disheartening to me, they're going to kill the API at the end of next year.
[00:12:29.480 --> 00:12:33.480]   The API was used by a lot of other apps.
[00:12:33.480 --> 00:12:38.480]   If you even if you used care weather, you could use the dark sky info in your weather line.
[00:12:38.480 --> 00:12:42.480]   Yeah, no API, no website, no nothing. It seems.
[00:12:42.480 --> 00:12:47.480]   It's very, very true to form for Apple that they don't.
[00:12:47.480 --> 00:12:52.480]   They bought dark sky because they wanted better weather for iPhones.
[00:12:52.480 --> 00:12:56.480]   They don't want to get into the multi platform weather business.
[00:12:56.480 --> 00:13:03.480]   But oh, I mean, it's all you just wish that they could loosen up a little bit and say,
[00:13:03.480 --> 00:13:14.480]   You know what? We will keep at least support for other for other platforms going because this isn't this wasn't just some early and development tool that they acquired before it could really gain traction.
[00:13:14.480 --> 00:13:20.480]   This was really one of the top three you would mention if you were recommending weather apps to people.
[00:13:20.480 --> 00:13:24.480]   So it's disappointing that it's being taken off the board for everybody, but iOS.
[00:13:24.480 --> 00:13:34.480]   Weather is weird because all weather apps use the same initial source, which is the federal, at least in the US.
[00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:41.480]   The National Weather Service, they get the information from them and then they make their forecasts out of it.
[00:13:41.480 --> 00:13:46.480]   The other Norway has one that's very good that I've used for a long time.
[00:13:46.480 --> 00:13:49.480]   Is there a Canadian? There must be a Canadian weather.
[00:13:49.480 --> 00:13:54.480]   Yeah, we don't have dark sky. A lot of people were freaking out and I just double checked and we still don't have it.
[00:13:54.480 --> 00:13:58.480]   I think it might be US only. The way pocket weather was Australia only.
[00:13:58.480 --> 00:14:04.480]   So I know it has a huge impact on Americans, but a lot of us were going, Oh, is it now? No, no.
[00:14:04.480 --> 00:14:13.480]   Right. So what they've said, and I think I don't remember if it's was it dark sky or some other one that had a lot of, I don't think it was dark sky.
[00:14:13.480 --> 00:14:19.480]   They had a lot of home weather stations as part of their data, which would give them additional information that the weather.
[00:14:19.480 --> 00:14:21.480]   I think that was the weather.
[00:14:21.480 --> 00:14:23.480]   The weather underground does that. Yeah.
[00:14:23.480 --> 00:14:32.480]   If you set up a weather station that a lot of a lot of different weather station makers support an API that lets you feed hyper local weather
[00:14:32.480 --> 00:14:41.480]   and it really is a killer. Dark sky had an iOS app. They say for now there will be no changes to the iOS app for now.
[00:14:41.480 --> 00:14:52.480]   It'll be continued to be available. The app on Android and Wear OS will no longer be available for download as of right now and service will end July 1st.
[00:14:52.480 --> 00:15:01.480]   If you're a subscriber because you can pay for this, you'll get a refund, pro rated refund. The website will continue until July 1st, 2020.
[00:15:01.480 --> 00:15:09.480]   But then you won't be able to get it forecast from it anymore. The API will stay through the end of 2021.
[00:15:09.480 --> 00:15:19.480]   And now all of a sudden the Apple privacy policy takes effect effect. If you go to your iPhone or your iPad, you'll get an update for a dark sky.
[00:15:19.480 --> 00:15:25.480]   They say it's a bug update, but really it's the Apple privacy policy that you'll have to agree to.
[00:15:25.480 --> 00:15:33.480]   It's interesting though, like what? Because a lot of people are just assuming Apple has bought this, you know, maybe for the talent, but it's a way to make a much better weather app for the iPhone.
[00:15:33.480 --> 00:15:37.480]   Right now that pulls Yahoo weather, I believe it's still Yahoo weather.
[00:15:37.480 --> 00:15:39.480]   Which is the worst, by the way, of all of them.
[00:15:39.480 --> 00:15:43.480]   Yeah, but this is a hyper US weather and Apple's got to solve weather international.
[00:15:43.480 --> 00:15:46.480]   Why do they buy them?
[00:15:46.480 --> 00:15:51.480]   They would have bought a much larger weather provider than dark sky if they really wanted to fix the iPhone weather app.
[00:15:51.480 --> 00:15:58.480]   Well, but again, all the data comes from the National Weather Service, at least in the US.
[00:15:58.480 --> 00:16:03.480]   So, and you can't buy the National Weather Service, although weather.com is trying.
[00:16:03.480 --> 00:16:10.480]   I'm not sure what you get. There must be something besides their forecast. You're not buying it for the forecast.
[00:16:10.480 --> 00:16:12.480]   Unless it's just an aqua hire.
[00:16:12.480 --> 00:16:17.480]   It must be the team, right? Or the API? I don't know.
[00:16:17.480 --> 00:16:24.480]   Sure. Well, also, there are two components to a really, really good weather apps, really good weather forecasting.
[00:16:24.480 --> 00:16:30.480]   Number one is, of course, being able to get access to National Weather Service data and other kinds of data.
[00:16:30.480 --> 00:16:40.480]   The second is having meteorologists, meteorologists on staff that know which weather model, which mathematical model to apply to each situation.
[00:16:40.480 --> 00:16:51.480]   So, perhaps, if I'm just blue-scaring here, if I were at Apple in my job were to make Apple weather the best in the industry standard, the best in the business,
[00:16:51.480 --> 00:16:59.480]   I would buy an app that is really not just simply a throwaway widget, which is what the built-in app has been.
[00:16:59.480 --> 00:17:08.480]   And then, I would also, just like the Apple acquired a whole bunch of people in sports medicine and health medicine to create their Apple Watch
[00:17:08.480 --> 00:17:12.480]   and make sure that these people know it's being developed by people who know their business.
[00:17:12.480 --> 00:17:19.480]   I would also be acquiring meteorologists who would then not only have the expertise to be able to create a global weather app,
[00:17:19.480 --> 00:17:25.480]   but also have the contacts and the business acumen to create deals with all these other services to say,
[00:17:25.480 --> 00:17:31.480]   "Can we have access to your model for this?" We need the New England model is no good because it has nothing to be right now,
[00:17:31.480 --> 00:17:35.480]   because it doesn't handle hurricanes and coastal weather very well.
[00:17:35.480 --> 00:17:38.480]   So, we're going to make sure that we have a model for this.
[00:17:38.480 --> 00:17:43.480]   So, if Apple is really trying to be top-notch with weather, it could be not just getting the app,
[00:17:43.480 --> 00:17:49.480]   but also that gets in weather data from everybody else,
[00:17:49.480 --> 00:17:57.480]   but also, again, acquiring a team of meteorologists and scientists and climate scientists who know exactly how to really fine-tune these things.
[00:17:57.480 --> 00:18:05.480]   Well, it's happened anyway. I'm disappointed because I use their API on Linux.
[00:18:05.480 --> 00:18:13.480]   But I'll start to use YR.NO, the Norwegian one. I think I can use that now, but I've been using their API for years.
[00:18:13.480 --> 00:18:19.480]   But I'm happy for the company. It was a great app, and if this was what they wanted to do with their app in their future,
[00:18:19.480 --> 00:18:23.480]   I can only congratulate them and thank you for the wonderful times we had together.
[00:18:23.480 --> 00:18:31.480]   They did. Somebody in the chat room saying, and I do remember this now, they would ask you in the app if the conditions were accurate
[00:18:31.480 --> 00:18:34.480]   and if you had anything to add or if your local conditions were different.
[00:18:34.480 --> 00:18:42.480]   And then Alex Howard in the chat room is saying, "Dark Sky's big thing has always been using AI to develop hyper-local weather forecasts,
[00:18:42.480 --> 00:18:47.480]   so I assume it's that accuracy in technology that Apple wants. That kind of makes sense."
[00:18:47.480 --> 00:18:52.480]   They must have some technology that's unique from whatever the weather service hands them.
[00:18:52.480 --> 00:18:59.480]   I wonder if if they do implement this technology, will that also end up in other places like Canada?
[00:18:59.480 --> 00:19:05.480]   Well, Renee have "Dark Sky" but "Dark Sky" by Apple built into iOS.
[00:19:05.480 --> 00:19:10.480]   So, what do you use Renee for your weather?
[00:19:10.480 --> 00:19:17.480]   I mean, carrot weather does work internationally, so I'm guessing they use other APIs outside of the US for weather.
[00:19:17.480 --> 00:19:22.480]   And I love that because it's abusive and I feel like my weather, I deserve whatever the weather app gives me.
[00:19:22.480 --> 00:19:26.480]   And then I use just the weather widget because it's built into so many things I can just ask.
[00:19:26.480 --> 00:19:28.480]   I often just ask Siri what the weather is.
[00:19:28.480 --> 00:19:33.480]   So I'm sure there's a national weather service. Every country has an environment. Canada has a...
[00:19:33.480 --> 00:19:36.480]   Yeah, I'm just down the street from their massive array of satellites.
[00:19:36.480 --> 00:19:39.480]   Yeah, the Canadian Centre for Climate Services.
[00:19:39.480 --> 00:19:43.480]   So, yeah, I think that's probably true in every country. They have a weather office.
[00:19:43.480 --> 00:19:49.480]   It's important for predicting storms, upcoming disasters to track hurricanes,
[00:19:49.480 --> 00:19:52.480]   for farmers to know what the crops are going to be like.
[00:19:52.480 --> 00:19:54.480]   I mean, this is all part a big part of the economy, so.
[00:19:54.480 --> 00:19:57.480]   We used to use it to predict the next Ice Age, but since it's not exactly equally,
[00:19:57.480 --> 00:20:00.480]   we just try to see how much land we're getting back every year.
[00:20:00.480 --> 00:20:04.480]   All right, so there's the breaking news.
[00:20:04.480 --> 00:20:06.480]   We got it in at the beginning of the show.
[00:20:06.480 --> 00:20:10.480]   And also, some people are super angry that the Android app and the Wear OS app are going away.
[00:20:10.480 --> 00:20:14.480]   And that's totally cool. Like, if they're leaving the iOS app, it doesn't seem like it would cause any harm
[00:20:14.480 --> 00:20:16.480]   to leave the Android app and Wear OS app.
[00:20:16.480 --> 00:20:20.480]   But what Apple typically does is keep hyper focus teams hyper focused,
[00:20:20.480 --> 00:20:23.480]   and they don't let them maintain any app.
[00:20:23.480 --> 00:20:28.480]   So it's odd to me. It's not odd to me that it's sad, but it's not odd to me that the Android and Wear OS app are going away.
[00:20:28.480 --> 00:20:34.480]   It's odd to me that the dark sky app is lingering, because often they will pull those apps down right away as well.
[00:20:34.480 --> 00:20:38.480]   Yeah. Well, you can't download it, and it'll stop working in a few months.
[00:20:38.480 --> 00:20:45.480]   Yeah. You know, it does put pay to any fantasy you might have that Apple will do messages for Android or anything like that.
[00:20:45.480 --> 00:20:48.480]   But clearly don't care about Android.
[00:20:48.480 --> 00:20:53.480]   I really wish that was a riff that Apple knew how to play, or at least Apple was interested in playing.
[00:20:53.480 --> 00:20:59.480]   That there are so many different categories, so many different badges you can give a company in which they prove how good they are
[00:20:59.480 --> 00:21:01.480]   and how capable they are.
[00:21:01.480 --> 00:21:08.480]   One of them is to be able to support users that are not necessarily using every product that you use.
[00:21:08.480 --> 00:21:15.480]   It's Apple's signature is the fact that if you have an Apple Watch, you're having Apple hardware running an Apple processor, running an Apple OS
[00:21:15.480 --> 00:21:20.480]   that connects to an Apple phone that's running an Apple OS on Apple hardware.
[00:21:20.480 --> 00:21:28.480]   You're running Apple services, and that's beautiful, but I would love to see them try to get that extra badge that says,
[00:21:28.480 --> 00:21:35.480]   "Well, what if you had to simply create a weather app that was a web app that would, in addition to your wonderful iOS onboard solution,
[00:21:35.480 --> 00:21:40.480]   that you're going to commit yourself to doing an app that everybody could possibly use?"
[00:21:40.480 --> 00:21:45.480]   I know it's not because they can't, it's because they're not interested, but it's kind of like how...
[00:21:45.480 --> 00:21:53.480]   It really is kind of like how when you see that, "Oh, well, this is this ballplayer never ever, ever wants to hit."
[00:21:53.480 --> 00:21:56.480]   He wants to feel, he wants to run, but yeah.
[00:21:56.480 --> 00:22:02.480]   They're not created cross-platform, and they're not created services, and people keep wanting them to make more cross-platform services.
[00:22:02.480 --> 00:22:04.480]   I just think of iTunes and say, "Really?"
[00:22:04.480 --> 00:22:07.480]   They're never going to get better at it if they don't actually do it, though.
[00:22:07.480 --> 00:22:10.480]   Practice.
[00:22:10.480 --> 00:22:15.480]   March 31st was the rumored day that Apple would be having an event.
[00:22:15.480 --> 00:22:20.480]   I guess because it's a Tuesday, and it's the last Tuesday in March, and that's what they did in the past.
[00:22:20.480 --> 00:22:23.480]   That's in the brighter timeline, Leo. We're in the darkest time.
[00:22:23.480 --> 00:22:27.480]   The only question is when this dark timeline began, right?
[00:22:27.480 --> 00:22:28.480]   Right.
[00:22:28.480 --> 00:22:29.480]   Right.
[00:22:29.480 --> 00:22:35.480]   I say, "Rene, this is a big disadvantage because we all have sources of information that we can use or we can't use,
[00:22:35.480 --> 00:22:40.480]   and it's usually when we try to figure out what Apple is going to be working on or what they're going to be announcing.
[00:22:40.480 --> 00:22:48.480]   It's a whole bunch of factors, but for me, as soon as I go on Instagram and I see that shot of your watch flying from Canada to New York and San Francisco,
[00:22:48.480 --> 00:22:56.480]   I know that, "Okay, I had ABC, but now that I've got D, I'd better prepare to cover something next week.
[00:22:56.480 --> 00:22:59.480]   Now that there's no travel, I got nothing."
[00:22:59.480 --> 00:23:00.480]   Yeah.
[00:23:00.480 --> 00:23:01.480]   It might still travel.
[00:23:01.480 --> 00:23:02.480]   It might still travel.
[00:23:02.480 --> 00:23:08.480]   It's good, though, because people started, I don't want to say stalking, but there was a bit of a paparazzi thing when people started traveling,
[00:23:08.480 --> 00:23:11.480]   there was all this offline, "Where are they going? What's happening?"
[00:23:11.480 --> 00:23:14.480]   And then if you weren't going, "Are they going somewhere? What's happening?"
[00:23:14.480 --> 00:23:16.480]   It's sort of nice that it doesn't exist anymore.
[00:23:16.480 --> 00:23:20.480]   Yeah, I think there was one time when Renee was just in New York with family,
[00:23:20.480 --> 00:23:24.480]   and people started asking about whether or not there was an event or something.
[00:23:24.480 --> 00:23:26.480]   He's like, "Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa."
[00:23:26.480 --> 00:23:27.480]   I just hang out with my family.
[00:23:27.480 --> 00:23:28.480]   I do, it's me asking.
[00:23:28.480 --> 00:23:31.480]   It's in New York, we know there's a briefing.
[00:23:31.480 --> 00:23:34.480]   I do hope you still get invited to briefings.
[00:23:34.480 --> 00:23:37.480]   I presume Apple loves you and would still do that.
[00:23:37.480 --> 00:23:38.480]   I hope so.
[00:23:38.480 --> 00:23:39.480]   I never take anything for granted.
[00:23:39.480 --> 00:23:40.480]   It's always nice if it happens.
[00:23:40.480 --> 00:23:41.480]   Trust me.
[00:23:41.480 --> 00:23:42.480]   It's not worth it.
[00:23:42.480 --> 00:23:43.480]   Word is my helper.
[00:23:43.480 --> 00:23:45.480]   I've guarded myself for just covering it remotely.
[00:23:45.480 --> 00:23:46.480]   Tell them, break your heart.
[00:23:46.480 --> 00:23:47.480]   They really will.
[00:23:47.480 --> 00:23:48.480]   Give them a chance.
[00:23:48.480 --> 00:23:51.480]   But it is nice to not be traveling.
[00:23:51.480 --> 00:23:55.480]   As much as it's fun to go, and Laurie has been with the last couple with me,
[00:23:55.480 --> 00:23:57.480]   it's like Christmas Eve.
[00:23:57.480 --> 00:24:00.480]   Part of you just wants to be over and have the presents.
[00:24:00.480 --> 00:24:02.480]   It's like just waiting and going through it is the hard part.
[00:24:02.480 --> 00:24:04.480]   You just want it to be over and have the presents.
[00:24:04.480 --> 00:24:09.480]   If I spend no more time in an airport lounge, I will be happy.
[00:24:09.480 --> 00:24:12.480]   And so far, that looks like that's possible.
[00:24:12.480 --> 00:24:13.480]   Yeah.
[00:24:13.480 --> 00:24:14.480]   Here we go.
[00:24:14.480 --> 00:24:18.480]   So what would they have announced today had they had an event?
[00:24:18.480 --> 00:24:19.480]   iPhone 9?
[00:24:19.480 --> 00:24:20.480]   iPhone 9.
[00:24:20.480 --> 00:24:21.480]   iPhone 9.
[00:24:21.480 --> 00:24:28.480]   There is a -- now, apparently a case site has put up a date April 5th.
[00:24:28.480 --> 00:24:33.480]   I never trust the case sites because they're throwing it up against the wall.
[00:24:33.480 --> 00:24:34.480]   But is that credible?
[00:24:34.480 --> 00:24:39.480]   They might still ship a successor to the iPhone SE in the next week.
[00:24:39.480 --> 00:24:47.480]   Well, the story is that best by another retailers have actually received product in boxes of cases
[00:24:47.480 --> 00:24:51.480]   for an iPhone 9 with the instructions to not put these out until April 5th.
[00:24:51.480 --> 00:24:55.480]   So along with people, of course, have pictures of these things.
[00:24:55.480 --> 00:24:58.480]   From Apple or from a third party cases.
[00:24:58.480 --> 00:25:04.480]   From third parties, but they certainly wouldn't ship product unless they really thought that
[00:25:04.480 --> 00:25:07.480]   this is when they're going to need to be on the shelves.
[00:25:07.480 --> 00:25:13.480]   And it's hard to now -- again, we can't make any assumptions about anything.
[00:25:13.480 --> 00:25:20.480]   So now it's sort of you're left wondering how long is that thread that once you yank that
[00:25:20.480 --> 00:25:25.480]   cord, is it now possible to stop something that was planned eight months in advance in terms
[00:25:25.480 --> 00:25:31.480]   of putting things into the retail chain and getting things and working with the best buys
[00:25:31.480 --> 00:25:36.480]   timeline and other retail stores timeline at some point, is it even possible to say Apple
[00:25:36.480 --> 00:25:39.480]   has told us that they are delaying this if assumed they're doing this.
[00:25:39.480 --> 00:25:42.480]   Apple has told us that they're not going to be shipping in April.
[00:25:42.480 --> 00:25:44.480]   They're going to be shipping this on March 31st.
[00:25:44.480 --> 00:25:46.480]   They're going to be shipping this in July now.
[00:25:46.480 --> 00:25:48.480]   But don't even ship these out.
[00:25:48.480 --> 00:25:51.480]   Well, no, they've already been out and they've already been printed with the information about
[00:25:51.480 --> 00:25:53.480]   when it should go out when it shouldn't.
[00:25:53.480 --> 00:25:58.480]   So it's we're in a maze of twisty passages all alike.
[00:25:58.480 --> 00:26:02.480]   And is the name 9?
[00:26:02.480 --> 00:26:04.480]   Carved in their sides.
[00:26:04.480 --> 00:26:07.480]   Is that going to be the name?
[00:26:07.480 --> 00:26:10.480]   It looks like an iPhone.
[00:26:10.480 --> 00:26:15.480]   But 9, I mean, with that would, you know, see, I think naming it the iPhone 9 is a mistake.
[00:26:15.480 --> 00:26:20.480]   But maybe they're back and forth with what what makes sense and what does it make sense.
[00:26:20.480 --> 00:26:25.480]   And I personally Leo, I think 9 makes more sense than SE 2.
[00:26:25.480 --> 00:26:33.480]   And that's because SE has it's attached to it is the idea of the smaller form factor.
[00:26:33.480 --> 00:26:39.480]   And I think Renee also has mentioned that Apple doesn't reuse names that often.
[00:26:39.480 --> 00:26:40.480]   So that's twofold.
[00:26:40.480 --> 00:26:47.480]   There's going to be a lot of SE fans like me who are going to be really upset that they're calling it SE when it's not small.
[00:26:47.480 --> 00:26:53.480]   Even though SE doesn't stand for small in any way, that's just the way we kind of identify with that font.
[00:26:53.480 --> 00:26:56.480]   But also because Apple doesn't tend to reuse names.
[00:26:56.480 --> 00:27:00.480]   So 9 makes more sense to me.
[00:27:00.480 --> 00:27:04.480]   But we're at 11. I think people will say, oh, that's the two-year-old.
[00:27:04.480 --> 00:27:05.480]   That's the two-year-old I saw.
[00:27:05.480 --> 00:27:07.480]   No, no, here's something to marketing corners.
[00:27:07.480 --> 00:27:08.480]   Here's what they do.
[00:27:08.480 --> 00:27:09.480]   I know what they're going to do.
[00:27:09.480 --> 00:27:11.480]   It's just the iPhone.
[00:27:11.480 --> 00:27:12.480]   Yeah.
[00:27:12.480 --> 00:27:13.480]   Yeah.
[00:27:13.480 --> 00:27:14.480]   No number.
[00:27:14.480 --> 00:27:17.480]   Yeah, no, I think that's what they're going to do because that's what they do with the iPad, right?
[00:27:17.480 --> 00:27:20.480]   But someone's going to walk in and they'll say, do you want the iPhone or the iPhone 11?
[00:27:20.480 --> 00:27:22.480]   They go, where's the other 10 like fans?
[00:27:22.480 --> 00:27:23.480]   Nobody says that.
[00:27:23.480 --> 00:27:24.480]   Nobody.
[00:27:24.480 --> 00:27:25.480]   Definitely not.
[00:27:25.480 --> 00:27:26.480]   I won't.
[00:27:26.480 --> 00:27:27.480]   I felt that.
[00:27:27.480 --> 00:27:28.480]   I don't know.
[00:27:28.480 --> 00:27:31.480]   I just went back.
[00:27:31.480 --> 00:27:32.480]   I just went back.
[00:27:32.480 --> 00:27:36.480]   I'm sorry, just a button, something that was asked before.
[00:27:36.480 --> 00:27:41.480]   I just went back to the 95 Mac site that has pictures of it.
[00:27:41.480 --> 00:27:42.480]   And it's actually late.
[00:27:42.480 --> 00:27:49.480]   It's a very pretty looking case, but it's labeled as the new iPhone 4.7 inch 2020.
[00:27:49.480 --> 00:27:51.480]   So it's not designed for it.
[00:27:51.480 --> 00:27:54.480]   So it doesn't say iPhone 9, it doesn't phone iPhone SE.
[00:27:54.480 --> 00:27:57.480]   So for all we know, this company is like...
[00:27:57.480 --> 00:27:58.480]   HTC names proud.
[00:27:58.480 --> 00:27:59.480]   Yeah.
[00:27:59.480 --> 00:28:00.480]   Yeah.
[00:28:00.480 --> 00:28:01.480]   That's not the name.
[00:28:01.480 --> 00:28:02.480]   That's what the case manufacturers put on there.
[00:28:02.480 --> 00:28:05.480]   So it would be clear what this goes to.
[00:28:05.480 --> 00:28:06.480]   Right.
[00:28:06.480 --> 00:28:08.480]   But also, that's also called that they didn't know.
[00:28:08.480 --> 00:28:09.480]   They didn't know, right?
[00:28:09.480 --> 00:28:11.480]   That's because it's going to be called the iPhone.
[00:28:11.480 --> 00:28:14.480]   And you can't just write the iPhone on the case.
[00:28:14.480 --> 00:28:15.480]   Right?
[00:28:15.480 --> 00:28:16.480]   That's my prediction.
[00:28:16.480 --> 00:28:17.480]   Right.
[00:28:17.480 --> 00:28:23.480]   And to me that reeks of we don't, we're just, we're hedging our bets and we're just going
[00:28:23.480 --> 00:28:27.480]   for it even though we don't have actual information.
[00:28:27.480 --> 00:28:33.480]   If Apple were working with retailers to tell them, "Okay, we're going to put out a phone,
[00:28:33.480 --> 00:28:36.480]   and here's the specs, here's what the camera's going to look like, here's the thickness,
[00:28:36.480 --> 00:28:39.480]   it's going to be called this."
[00:28:39.480 --> 00:28:43.480]   You'd have that information on your phone case, but if Apple's not actually working
[00:28:43.480 --> 00:28:47.480]   directly with these manufacturers, these are people just speculating on it.
[00:28:47.480 --> 00:28:49.480]   And case makers do this all the time.
[00:28:49.480 --> 00:28:53.480]   They speculate on what the next phone is going to be.
[00:28:53.480 --> 00:28:59.480]   They have plenty of probably more rumors than we do to figure out how they're going to make
[00:28:59.480 --> 00:29:01.480]   their case, what they're going to make it look like.
[00:29:01.480 --> 00:29:03.480]   And they just kind of hope that that's right.
[00:29:03.480 --> 00:29:08.480]   And then if it's not right, then they take that quick loss, but they've already got the
[00:29:08.480 --> 00:29:12.480]   manufacturing in place to just quickly change what it actually is and make it look right,
[00:29:12.480 --> 00:29:18.480]   or change the cover so that it doesn't look like a, it doesn't say iPhone 4.1 inch or whatever,
[00:29:18.480 --> 00:29:23.480]   or 4.7 inch, it actually says iPhone SE or iPhone 9 or something like that.
[00:29:23.480 --> 00:29:29.480]   So to me, that's proof that they don't know what's coming.
[00:29:29.480 --> 00:29:32.480]   I think you're right, it's kind of suspicious.
[00:29:32.480 --> 00:29:37.480]   Also the maker, it's not like it's in case or a major maker, the phone they have is urban
[00:29:37.480 --> 00:29:38.480]   armor gear.
[00:29:38.480 --> 00:29:45.480]   However, usually when I see manufacturers head make bets like that, it's stable, they will
[00:29:45.480 --> 00:29:50.480]   make kind of like a basic run that they can eat if they have to, and they're certainly
[00:29:50.480 --> 00:29:53.480]   not going to box them and ship them.
[00:29:53.480 --> 00:29:58.480]   And if they're given that this is supposed to be displayed at Best Buy, probably this
[00:29:58.480 --> 00:30:02.480]   company had to actually purchase space on the rack.
[00:30:02.480 --> 00:30:08.480]   So either they were absolutely, they were either drunk with the drunk with conviction here.
[00:30:08.480 --> 00:30:14.480]   They had the animal on trails, they had the pop them at a magic eight ball.
[00:30:14.480 --> 00:30:18.720]   And they were that convinced that there was going to be a new iPhone and that it was going
[00:30:18.720 --> 00:30:24.720]   to fit this case, or at some point they were told, here is what is going to look like,
[00:30:24.720 --> 00:30:26.480]   here is when we intend to ship it.
[00:30:26.480 --> 00:30:27.480]   Apple never does that.
[00:30:27.480 --> 00:30:28.480]   Yeah.
[00:30:28.480 --> 00:30:29.480]   And some companies have been wrong.
[00:30:29.480 --> 00:30:33.600]   Like remember the Verge, when they were, this is my next, they had a design for a teardrop
[00:30:33.600 --> 00:30:37.480]   iPhone 5 and one of the case makers went all in on doing it and they lost it.
[00:30:37.480 --> 00:30:42.400]   As far as I know, Apple, and I've talked to some accessory makers, does not communicate
[00:30:42.400 --> 00:30:44.760]   there's design information ahead of time.
[00:30:44.760 --> 00:30:48.320]   Which is why they pay so much to the analysts to get it off the supply chain.
[00:30:48.320 --> 00:30:51.560]   But it's interesting to me that they could call it anything.
[00:30:51.560 --> 00:30:54.680]   That's just a matter of, I don't know if it's Phil Schiller or Greg Jawswack or somebody
[00:30:54.680 --> 00:30:58.480]   goes over and makes a final decision off the list of, they can typically pick a name and
[00:30:58.480 --> 00:31:01.400]   then they have a list of every possible alternative and they go back and forth.
[00:31:01.400 --> 00:31:04.080]   They decide either the original name or one of the alternatives is better and they go
[00:31:04.080 --> 00:31:05.080]   with that.
[00:31:05.080 --> 00:31:09.080]   But like I've talked with Lori, they could call it the iPhone mother of dragons they want,
[00:31:09.080 --> 00:31:10.080]   literally marketing.
[00:31:10.080 --> 00:31:11.080]   And they should.
[00:31:11.080 --> 00:31:13.080]   No, they totally should.
[00:31:13.080 --> 00:31:16.960]   So to me, it's more like how are they going to position it, especially trying to sell
[00:31:16.960 --> 00:31:17.960]   it now?
[00:31:17.960 --> 00:31:19.320]   Like what does that announcement look like?
[00:31:19.320 --> 00:31:23.880]   I could imagine if the event was on, it would be an almost beat for beat replay of the iPhone
[00:31:23.880 --> 00:31:24.880]   SE.
[00:31:24.880 --> 00:31:27.480]   You know, some of our customers love the home button, they've told us how much they love
[00:31:27.480 --> 00:31:28.480]   it.
[00:31:28.480 --> 00:31:30.640]   So we're bringing back the home button, but we're doing it with all like, and then they
[00:31:30.640 --> 00:31:34.240]   show off the great cameras and they show off all the things that you can finally get with
[00:31:34.240 --> 00:31:36.520]   the home button iPhone.
[00:31:36.520 --> 00:31:41.560]   And then they introduce the Apple, the air tags as like, instead of air pods, air tags
[00:31:41.560 --> 00:31:43.840]   is the other new cool accessory you can get.
[00:31:43.840 --> 00:31:47.440]   But that's one of the things they would be announcing today, probably right?
[00:31:47.440 --> 00:31:48.440]   Air tags.
[00:31:48.440 --> 00:31:49.440]   Probably.
[00:31:49.440 --> 00:31:52.200]   But and how do you do it in a way like, especially like, if you go out and lose your phone, you're
[00:31:52.200 --> 00:31:55.320]   like, I'm not going out really going out right now.
[00:31:55.320 --> 00:32:01.040]   I'm just super interested in how Apple positions this when they go to market.
[00:32:01.040 --> 00:32:05.840]   And to say nothing of the fact that Apple's never announced, never revealed how here's
[00:32:05.840 --> 00:32:10.720]   the percentage of iPhones that we sell via via the website versus here's how many we
[00:32:10.720 --> 00:32:12.080]   sell throughout the retail stores.
[00:32:12.080 --> 00:32:14.720]   Now they have no one coming into retail stores.
[00:32:14.720 --> 00:32:20.960]   There are rumors that there's going to have a soft, unopening of some stores at the end
[00:32:20.960 --> 00:32:21.960]   of the month.
[00:32:21.960 --> 00:32:26.440]   I think that's wishful thinking, but it's again, there's so much that we have to guess
[00:32:26.440 --> 00:32:30.600]   at right now that are they going to think that this is it's too important to launch
[00:32:30.600 --> 00:32:35.800]   a new phone today so that we can launch the next phone in September or October that
[00:32:35.800 --> 00:32:40.240]   we are willing to eat a really, really we're going to we're willing to waste a really big
[00:32:40.240 --> 00:32:45.320]   product launch on what's going to be has to be very, very mediocre sales.
[00:32:45.320 --> 00:32:49.760]   And also to say nothing the fact that we're not going to be able to do our communication
[00:32:49.760 --> 00:32:51.360]   as well as we possibly could.
[00:32:51.360 --> 00:32:56.000]   We can't bring people into a hotel room and give them the usual hour and a half.
[00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:59.760]   We want to make sure that we tell you everything that we think is important about this.
[00:32:59.760 --> 00:33:04.000]   And we want to make sure that we're showing you every step of the way what's going on.
[00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:09.520]   I think I just ship it to do a do a do a FaceTime video and hope for the best.
[00:33:09.520 --> 00:33:13.080]   This is this is I'm I'm being quite serious here.
[00:33:13.080 --> 00:33:17.600]   Part of what makes these times interesting once we partition out we shouldn't but once
[00:33:17.600 --> 00:33:23.240]   we if we mentally block out the danger to businesses the danger to life.
[00:33:23.240 --> 00:33:29.680]   It's interesting to see here's how Stephen Colbert will do a late night TV show streaming
[00:33:29.680 --> 00:33:33.360]   from their house and without the reaction of a live on it was terrible.
[00:33:33.360 --> 00:33:34.760]   No, I thought I thought.
[00:33:34.760 --> 00:33:35.760]   Wait a minute.
[00:33:35.760 --> 00:33:37.520]   John Oliver John Oliver did it and was terrible.
[00:33:37.520 --> 00:33:38.520]   I haven't seen Colbert's.
[00:33:38.520 --> 00:33:39.520]   Well, I don't know.
[00:33:39.520 --> 00:33:43.800]   But he said he was used to that because British comedians don't get laughs anyway.
[00:33:43.800 --> 00:33:44.800]   But but that's what I'm saying.
[00:33:44.800 --> 00:33:47.680]   So now we're going to just like we started territory.
[00:33:47.680 --> 00:33:48.680]   Absolutely.
[00:33:48.680 --> 00:33:49.680]   Exactly.
[00:33:49.680 --> 00:33:53.880]   We're saying what I love about this this sort of TV is that it's usually so controlled
[00:33:53.880 --> 00:33:57.600]   right that nothing can possibly happen that has not been plotted out.
[00:33:57.600 --> 00:33:59.480]   They all look like us now.
[00:33:59.480 --> 00:34:00.480]   Exactly.
[00:34:00.480 --> 00:34:03.640]   And they're going to see this for the home.
[00:34:03.640 --> 00:34:04.640]   Yeah.
[00:34:04.640 --> 00:34:09.880]   Well, here's how Apple does a product launch from their homes without the resources.
[00:34:09.880 --> 00:34:10.880]   What do you do?
[00:34:10.880 --> 00:34:11.880]   Apple.
[00:34:11.880 --> 00:34:12.880]   Okay.
[00:34:12.880 --> 00:34:15.080]   So clearly you're not going to do an event today.
[00:34:15.080 --> 00:34:18.000]   Clearly the tags you're not going to do a press release.
[00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:19.200]   You're going to wait for an event?
[00:34:19.200 --> 00:34:20.200]   What are you going to do?
[00:34:20.200 --> 00:34:22.240]   Well, they did a press release with the iPad and Apple.
[00:34:22.240 --> 00:34:23.240]   Yeah.
[00:34:23.240 --> 00:34:29.040]   But those are the look in fact in hindsight that new iPad was barely an update and then
[00:34:29.040 --> 00:34:30.920]   Mac to developer it's a developer model.
[00:34:30.920 --> 00:34:31.920]   Yeah.
[00:34:31.920 --> 00:34:33.880]   And the MacBook Air barely an update.
[00:34:33.880 --> 00:34:35.600]   You know, I had a key in a good keyboard.
[00:34:35.600 --> 00:34:37.080]   So that's actually more significant.
[00:34:37.080 --> 00:34:41.520]   But these were kind of much more like the slipstreamed product releases you'd expect
[00:34:41.520 --> 00:34:45.040]   every year or so with with Apple existing products.
[00:34:45.040 --> 00:34:47.760]   New a new product announcement.
[00:34:47.760 --> 00:34:49.560]   How does Apple do it in this day and age?
[00:34:49.560 --> 00:34:51.200]   Do you wait until this is over?
[00:34:51.200 --> 00:34:52.960]   That could be next year.
[00:34:52.960 --> 00:34:53.960]   What do you do?
[00:34:53.960 --> 00:34:54.960]   I would take that video team.
[00:34:54.960 --> 00:34:58.040]   I would take that video team they have and say make us an awesome, awesome video that
[00:34:58.040 --> 00:35:01.200]   we could put up on apple.com and everybody can stream it right now.
[00:35:01.200 --> 00:35:05.720]   And maybe you have Craig walking around and you have Jaws or Phil or whoever the product
[00:35:05.720 --> 00:35:06.720]   manager is.
[00:35:06.720 --> 00:35:12.240]   I liked Craig's video that he did in apparently in his office with the map demonstrating the
[00:35:12.240 --> 00:35:13.640]   mouse features.
[00:35:13.640 --> 00:35:15.280]   I thought that was well done.
[00:35:15.280 --> 00:35:16.280]   Yeah.
[00:35:16.280 --> 00:35:17.280]   So he's Craig.
[00:35:17.280 --> 00:35:18.280]   He's great at that.
[00:35:18.280 --> 00:35:19.280]   He could do that, I guess.
[00:35:19.280 --> 00:35:22.360]   It's an it's a great opportunity for augmented reality.
[00:35:22.360 --> 00:35:24.080]   I'm saying that completely seriously.
[00:35:24.080 --> 00:35:29.880]   What if they did like a keynote in which basically just clear off this much of your table and
[00:35:29.880 --> 00:35:34.920]   just simply hold up your phone and you will see, there'll be about 40 rows back, but you
[00:35:34.920 --> 00:35:36.760]   can change the angle, whoever you want.
[00:35:36.760 --> 00:35:40.680]   And then once you get the product, you can go to the demo area and just simply put this
[00:35:40.680 --> 00:35:42.720]   on any space you want.
[00:35:42.720 --> 00:35:47.920]   If you are just contemplating buying this sort of thing, you can sort of fondle it even
[00:35:47.920 --> 00:35:49.640]   though you can't fondle it in the store.
[00:35:49.640 --> 00:35:54.800]   If you are Renee Ritchie, and well, no, Renee Ritchie already has one, but if you are an
[00:35:54.800 --> 00:35:58.840]   independent, if you are someone who does not have access to review hardware, you can
[00:35:58.840 --> 00:36:02.320]   now have video of this thing a week in advance.
[00:36:02.320 --> 00:36:04.360]   It's there's so many things they could do.
[00:36:04.360 --> 00:36:05.360]   It's exciting.
[00:36:05.360 --> 00:36:10.600]   How does David Bogart, the only actual physical unit, everyone else is standing around waiting
[00:36:10.600 --> 00:36:12.000]   in an AR environment?
[00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:13.760]   These things have to be factored in.
[00:36:13.760 --> 00:36:15.480]   Is that what happens to those demos?
[00:36:15.480 --> 00:36:17.040]   Now the truth comes out.
[00:36:17.040 --> 00:36:19.040]   Yeah, there are no images on this level.
[00:36:19.040 --> 00:36:22.400]   Because you have big broadcast cameras and people doing live hits and they have the
[00:36:22.400 --> 00:36:26.360]   YouTubers with their cameras and you have the people desperate to get it up right away,
[00:36:26.360 --> 00:36:28.280]   like the traditional bloggers.
[00:36:28.280 --> 00:36:31.200]   And there's never enough to go around.
[00:36:31.200 --> 00:36:34.040]   Journalism used to be a gentleman's occupation.
[00:36:34.040 --> 00:36:35.040]   Now the whole...
[00:36:35.040 --> 00:36:37.840]   The best was the riff-crapped of the let-in.
[00:36:37.840 --> 00:36:42.200]   When Periscope, and I forget the other one, Miracad or something came out, and there was
[00:36:42.200 --> 00:36:46.920]   just a bunch of people slamming into each other on tables because they weren't paying attention.
[00:36:46.920 --> 00:36:47.920]   They were just like, "Avoid the streamers!
[00:36:47.920 --> 00:36:48.920]   Avoid the streamers!"
[00:36:48.920 --> 00:36:53.920]   Well, so predictions.
[00:36:53.920 --> 00:36:56.160]   Laurie, what do you think Apple will do?
[00:36:56.160 --> 00:36:58.720]   I think Apple will launch an iPhone 9.
[00:36:58.720 --> 00:37:01.240]   I'm going to call it that.
[00:37:01.240 --> 00:37:02.240]   And here's why.
[00:37:02.240 --> 00:37:08.240]   Because just like the iPad Pro and the iPad Air, we're just kind of spec bumps of existing
[00:37:08.240 --> 00:37:10.640]   content or existing devices.
[00:37:10.640 --> 00:37:13.040]   I think that the iPhone 9 is going to be that.
[00:37:13.040 --> 00:37:14.840]   It's going to be better.
[00:37:14.840 --> 00:37:19.880]   It's going to have a better camera and better specs on the inside.
[00:37:19.880 --> 00:37:22.240]   But it's going to be an iPhone 8.
[00:37:22.240 --> 00:37:24.360]   So that's a spec bump in my opinion.
[00:37:24.360 --> 00:37:25.880]   So I think it is going to come out.
[00:37:25.880 --> 00:37:30.520]   And to bolster that prediction, they'd be making them.
[00:37:30.520 --> 00:37:35.480]   It seems pretty clear from all the rumors that there are enough of them to start selling
[00:37:35.480 --> 00:37:37.480]   this week if they wanted to.
[00:37:37.480 --> 00:37:39.560]   It is easy to announce.
[00:37:39.560 --> 00:37:40.960]   You don't have to do a big demo.
[00:37:40.960 --> 00:37:43.360]   In fact, you almost don't want to do a big demo.
[00:37:43.360 --> 00:37:47.600]   It really is more about having in the store so that people come in and say, "That iPhone
[00:37:47.600 --> 00:37:49.000]   11 is so expensive."
[00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:53.080]   The guy can say, "Well, but there's also the iPhone."
[00:37:53.080 --> 00:37:54.080]   And we also have an iPhone with it.
[00:37:54.080 --> 00:37:58.720]   We've gotten a lot of rumors recently said that per an internal meeting yesterday, Apple
[00:37:58.720 --> 00:38:02.160]   is now preparing for an April release, 10 out of dates, announcement on April 15th,
[00:38:02.160 --> 00:38:03.160]   shipments on April 22nd.
[00:38:03.160 --> 00:38:06.720]   But we're in the middle of a pandemic so things can change.
[00:38:06.720 --> 00:38:07.640]   Interesting.
[00:38:07.640 --> 00:38:14.360]   That's, I guess, really what I'm asking is if you're Tim Cook, do you think Tim Cook
[00:38:14.360 --> 00:38:16.800]   just completely out of nowhere?
[00:38:16.800 --> 00:38:18.800]   I was thinking about this yesterday.
[00:38:18.800 --> 00:38:20.600]   Is he going into the office?
[00:38:20.600 --> 00:38:22.600]   No, he sent a video for his home office.
[00:38:22.600 --> 00:38:27.000]   He did that nice portrait mode video in his home, a vertical video in his home office
[00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:30.480]   where you see him pressing the button to start it and then reaching over to end it afterwards.
[00:38:30.480 --> 00:38:31.480]   Oh, nice.
[00:38:31.480 --> 00:38:32.480]   He didn't even have an editor.
[00:38:32.480 --> 00:38:33.480]   Just like that.
[00:38:33.480 --> 00:38:34.480]   Social distancing, Leo.
[00:38:34.480 --> 00:38:35.480]   Social distancing, Leo.
[00:38:35.480 --> 00:38:36.480]   So that's okay.
[00:38:36.480 --> 00:38:37.480]   So that's good.
[00:38:37.480 --> 00:38:38.720]   I was wondering, are you going in?
[00:38:38.720 --> 00:38:42.000]   I mean, if you're Tim Cook, you could make it safe to go in.
[00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:43.200]   Yeah, you empty out.
[00:38:43.200 --> 00:38:44.200]   You looked him.
[00:38:44.200 --> 00:38:45.200]   That's for his empty.
[00:38:45.200 --> 00:38:46.200]   Yeah.
[00:38:46.200 --> 00:38:48.040]   For 14 days before Tim gets here.
[00:38:48.040 --> 00:38:49.040]   Yeah.
[00:38:49.040 --> 00:38:53.520]   I honestly, I honestly think that shareholders on the board would be furious if Tim Cook did
[00:38:53.520 --> 00:38:55.280]   anything to risk his health.
[00:38:55.280 --> 00:38:56.280]   That's true.
[00:38:56.280 --> 00:39:01.960]   Just even if it's just the possibility that he will have a recoverable bout with this
[00:39:01.960 --> 00:39:02.960]   flu.
[00:39:02.960 --> 00:39:05.560]   He's gone for two weeks.
[00:39:05.560 --> 00:39:08.040]   That is a disaster for any company.
[00:39:08.040 --> 00:39:13.960]   In fact, with it all likelihood, they have a 24/7 doctor monitoring him sitting next
[00:39:13.960 --> 00:39:16.880]   to him saying, don't don't don't.
[00:39:16.880 --> 00:39:19.040]   Taking the COVID test every day.
[00:39:19.040 --> 00:39:20.040]   Every day.
[00:39:20.040 --> 00:39:21.040]   Yeah.
[00:39:21.040 --> 00:39:23.800]   He's surrounded by a ring of interns that are being that are being tasked to jump in front
[00:39:23.800 --> 00:39:25.600]   of any germs that might come their way.
[00:39:25.600 --> 00:39:26.600]   Like a soccer school.
[00:39:26.600 --> 00:39:27.600]   Right?
[00:39:27.600 --> 00:39:31.120]   I mean, every day there's a celebrity COVID list being added to.
[00:39:31.120 --> 00:39:32.120]   Yeah.
[00:39:32.120 --> 00:39:34.800]   Did you see Chris Cuomo with his brother?
[00:39:34.800 --> 00:39:37.000]   His brother, it's the best and the yellow, other Italian.
[00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:38.000]   Oh my God.
[00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:40.000]   He called him a meatball.
[00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:45.240]   His brother, the governor of New York and Chris, the anchor on CNN.
[00:39:45.240 --> 00:39:51.520]   Apparently, I didn't know this has been going on for years, but yesterday, Governor Cuomo
[00:39:51.520 --> 00:39:53.280]   calls his brother a meatball.
[00:39:53.280 --> 00:39:57.960]   His brother says, yeah, but mom gave me your sauce recipe.
[00:39:57.960 --> 00:39:59.360]   She didn't give it to you.
[00:39:59.360 --> 00:40:01.320]   And he shows a video of him making this sauce.
[00:40:01.320 --> 00:40:03.320]   I'll bring you some in the governor's mansion.
[00:40:03.320 --> 00:40:05.440]   But he was very different today.
[00:40:05.440 --> 00:40:07.440]   He's like, you know, I know he's like that on the air.
[00:40:07.440 --> 00:40:09.640]   His job is to be bombastic, but he's really the sweetest guy.
[00:40:09.640 --> 00:40:10.640]   He's my best friend.
[00:40:10.640 --> 00:40:11.640]   Of course.
[00:40:11.640 --> 00:40:12.800]   That's brothers, right?
[00:40:12.800 --> 00:40:17.600]   That's, I mean, that's exactly it's, it's, it is, I took it as sweet.
[00:40:17.600 --> 00:40:19.080]   I thought it was really funny though.
[00:40:19.080 --> 00:40:20.080]   But it was hilarious.
[00:40:20.080 --> 00:40:21.080]   We was like, are you going to run for president?
[00:40:21.080 --> 00:40:22.080]   No, are you thinking about it?
[00:40:22.080 --> 00:40:24.080]   No, I don't even know what you're thinking about it because I'm thinking it.
[00:40:24.080 --> 00:40:25.080]   And it's no.
[00:40:25.080 --> 00:40:26.080]   Where'd you get your interview skills?
[00:40:26.080 --> 00:40:27.080]   I think you know.
[00:40:27.080 --> 00:40:29.400]   He said, I have a real job.
[00:40:29.400 --> 00:40:32.000]   I don't work an hour a day in an armchair.
[00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:33.520]   It's really, really funny.
[00:40:33.520 --> 00:40:35.720]   Let me reframe the question.
[00:40:35.720 --> 00:40:40.960]   When you were 17 and I was 19, were you thinking about borrowing my car without asking and
[00:40:40.960 --> 00:40:41.960]   wrapping it around a tree?
[00:40:41.960 --> 00:40:46.680]   You know, you know dad wanted to be president badly.
[00:40:46.680 --> 00:40:51.840]   And for some reason, and it's always been a great mystery, dad just stopped all of a
[00:40:51.840 --> 00:40:55.720]   sudden and there was always this thought, he's got a skeleton in the closet.
[00:40:55.720 --> 00:40:59.360]   There's something that he just didn't want to, you know, he realized if I run for president,
[00:40:59.360 --> 00:41:01.480]   they're going to find out.
[00:41:01.480 --> 00:41:03.120]   And that's completely speculation.
[00:41:03.120 --> 00:41:04.120]   It's probably not true.
[00:41:04.120 --> 00:41:08.520]   Maybe he just had there was sensible enough not to want to do that horrible job.
[00:41:08.520 --> 00:41:11.760]   Anyway, what a family.
[00:41:11.760 --> 00:41:13.360]   What a family.
[00:41:13.360 --> 00:41:14.360]   Where were we?
[00:41:14.360 --> 00:41:15.760]   Oh, Andy predictions.
[00:41:15.760 --> 00:41:17.360]   What do you think Apple's going to do?
[00:41:17.360 --> 00:41:18.560]   I think Lori's right.
[00:41:18.560 --> 00:41:22.160]   I think it's going to be, I think it's coming as can be called the iPhone nine.
[00:41:22.160 --> 00:41:25.360]   I think that's absolutely the perfect name for them to call it.
[00:41:25.360 --> 00:41:31.080]   When you call something an iPhone SE, it doesn't instinctively communicate where this thing
[00:41:31.080 --> 00:41:34.880]   is on the great pageantry of iPhone releases.
[00:41:34.880 --> 00:41:39.840]   It looks like something separate and other than as opposed to we have the iPhone 11,
[00:41:39.840 --> 00:41:40.840]   we have the iPhone 10.
[00:41:40.840 --> 00:41:45.760]   Now we have the iPhone nine people know who knew how to do basic math are going to expect
[00:41:45.760 --> 00:41:49.920]   the iPhone nine to be lower powered and have and be less expensive.
[00:41:49.920 --> 00:41:54.320]   But the important thing is that they can they can introduce a lower priced iPhone to
[00:41:54.320 --> 00:41:59.480]   people's hands that unlike the other models that they've been keeping in inventory are
[00:41:59.480 --> 00:42:04.520]   capable of running the next versions of iOS and able to use the next editions of Apple
[00:42:04.520 --> 00:42:07.200]   services for the next two or three or four years.
[00:42:07.200 --> 00:42:13.280]   This is it's really, really important because Apple's still selling a major amount of phones,
[00:42:13.280 --> 00:42:18.320]   but every single bit of guidance that they can see outside is that if they're vulnerable
[00:42:18.320 --> 00:42:24.280]   anywhere, it's to $500 and $400 Android phones that have seemingly the same build quality
[00:42:24.280 --> 00:42:29.680]   as a premium phone are just as fast as most users want and have decent cameras that if
[00:42:29.680 --> 00:42:31.920]   they can, but they never have to deal with that problem.
[00:42:31.920 --> 00:42:37.440]   If they just simply say you can either have a Samsung phone or even a phone from a maker
[00:42:37.440 --> 00:42:41.480]   that you've probably never heard of because they can't afford to advertise anywhere or
[00:42:41.480 --> 00:42:45.560]   you can have a genuine Apple product that's supported by genuine Apple geniuses and actual
[00:42:45.560 --> 00:42:49.360]   Apple genius bars and they could do these really cool AR things that we really, really
[00:42:49.360 --> 00:42:53.440]   want you to get interested in and we really are confident you will be interested in by
[00:42:53.440 --> 00:42:56.600]   2022 when we actually have some goggles to sell you.
[00:42:56.600 --> 00:43:00.520]   What do they do with tags?
[00:43:00.520 --> 00:43:04.120]   They might say, I think that there's, it costs them nothing to save it for the end of the
[00:43:04.120 --> 00:43:05.120]   year.
[00:43:05.120 --> 00:43:08.400]   These are, they're unless they're going to charge $99 each for them, they're going to
[00:43:08.400 --> 00:43:10.960]   be the perfect thing to buy people for this anyway.
[00:43:10.960 --> 00:43:11.960]   Sesak, yeah.
[00:43:11.960 --> 00:43:12.960]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:43:12.960 --> 00:43:18.200]   It's like when you buy somebody that first like a smart light bulb where they're not
[00:43:18.200 --> 00:43:21.080]   going to just put it in the kitchen and then that's it.
[00:43:21.080 --> 00:43:22.960]   You know that they're going to come back and buy more.
[00:43:22.960 --> 00:43:26.840]   So if they can sell these for 29 bucks, they're going to be stocking stuffers, they're going
[00:43:26.840 --> 00:43:28.160]   to be promotional giveaways.
[00:43:28.160 --> 00:43:33.640]   There's no, I can't see any reason for them to release it early unless the point was that
[00:43:33.640 --> 00:43:38.960]   hey, in 2019 when they were planning out, when they had their vision of what's going
[00:43:38.960 --> 00:43:43.360]   to happen in spring and that vision did not include a pandemic, they thought, okay, well,
[00:43:43.360 --> 00:43:48.640]   obviously we have to release these tags sometime before WWDC because at that point we're going
[00:43:48.640 --> 00:43:50.080]   to be introducing new API.
[00:43:50.080 --> 00:43:53.520]   That will let it do, let the developers actually support them directly.
[00:43:53.520 --> 00:43:56.440]   I could see that that would be the reason why they would want to get them out in April
[00:43:56.440 --> 00:44:02.040]   or May so that by the time the real magic of what these things can do are supported by
[00:44:02.040 --> 00:44:07.040]   APIs, developers can buy them in quantity wherever they want.
[00:44:07.040 --> 00:44:10.320]   But it still makes sense for them to do it in fall.
[00:44:10.320 --> 00:44:15.600]   I don't think that especially something that is going to require a good demonstration,
[00:44:15.600 --> 00:44:21.520]   or support, and maybe going into a store just to see how the hell these things work, I do
[00:44:21.520 --> 00:44:22.880]   see them delaying these things.
[00:44:22.880 --> 00:44:25.040]   >> Laura, you Greek tags in Christmas?
[00:44:25.040 --> 00:44:30.080]   >> Yeah, well, actually Andy makes a good point, which is WWDC would actually be a great
[00:44:30.080 --> 00:44:31.080]   time to release Apple tags.
[00:44:31.080 --> 00:44:33.000]   >> Is there going to be a WWDC?
[00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:36.000]   >> Well, so far there is going to be a virtual war.
[00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:39.600]   >> Remember Google said we're going to do a virtual Google I/O and then said, yeah, maybe
[00:44:39.600 --> 00:44:40.600]   not.
[00:44:40.600 --> 00:44:41.600]   >> That's true.
[00:44:41.600 --> 00:44:47.560]   >> So what they could still do though, even if they don't actually hold a full conference
[00:44:47.560 --> 00:44:55.320]   is something like a keynote address where they lay out the groundwork for the next iOS
[00:44:55.320 --> 00:44:59.640]   and at the same time say, and here's these Apple tags that we're going to send out to
[00:44:59.640 --> 00:45:03.640]   all these developers and they're going to use them and try them out and then they'll
[00:45:03.640 --> 00:45:05.840]   be available this fall.
[00:45:05.840 --> 00:45:11.880]   Or maybe they'll announce it publicly so that you can purchase them right away in June.
[00:45:11.880 --> 00:45:14.120]   It makes a lot of sense for them to do something like that.
[00:45:14.120 --> 00:45:19.960]   So that just like what Andy's saying by September when the iPhone 12 comes out, it's well positioned
[00:45:19.960 --> 00:45:25.960]   along with LiDAR to work well and have developers already doing stuff with it and developing
[00:45:25.960 --> 00:45:26.960]   for it.
[00:45:26.960 --> 00:45:30.360]   So I think potentially they could come out in June.
[00:45:30.360 --> 00:45:33.600]   >> All right, Renee.
[00:45:33.600 --> 00:45:37.840]   >> Andy and Laurie agree that it will be the iPhone 9.
[00:45:37.840 --> 00:45:41.240]   It will be released this month, early this month, right?
[00:45:41.240 --> 00:45:43.760]   Maybe even this week, possibly.
[00:45:43.760 --> 00:45:46.400]   Tags for Christmas, your turn.
[00:45:46.400 --> 00:45:49.320]   What is your prognostication?
[00:45:49.320 --> 00:45:53.000]   >> My guess just based on what's going on now is that if Apple does decide to go forward
[00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:54.160]   with it, we'll see it mid-month.
[00:45:54.160 --> 00:45:56.480]   It'll be a press release drop.
[00:45:56.480 --> 00:46:00.600]   I don't know if they'll bother to do media beforehand or just drop the press release
[00:46:00.600 --> 00:46:05.320]   and then start calling people.
[00:46:05.320 --> 00:46:08.160]   But yeah, I think that'll be the way that they'll go.
[00:46:08.160 --> 00:46:11.560]   Because it's a known and understood product, everyone knows what an iPhone 8 is.
[00:46:11.560 --> 00:46:14.680]   Everyone knows what the iPhone XR 11 internals are.
[00:46:14.680 --> 00:46:16.560]   And that's sort of an easy story to tell.
[00:46:16.560 --> 00:46:20.760]   Again, it's everything you loved about your home button iPhone but with the new specs.
[00:46:20.760 --> 00:46:22.840]   And they have told that story with the iPhone SE.
[00:46:22.840 --> 00:46:24.200]   They told it with the iPod Touch.
[00:46:24.200 --> 00:46:25.400]   It really is.
[00:46:25.400 --> 00:46:29.120]   This is the thing that you're familiar with and we're just updating it so you can continue
[00:46:29.120 --> 00:46:31.560]   to enjoy it for a few more years.
[00:46:31.560 --> 00:46:36.520]   And the tags, I agree, and Apple can do a cheeky WD, like they've done in the past.
[00:46:36.520 --> 00:46:38.280]   We're introducing size classes.
[00:46:38.280 --> 00:46:43.360]   There's no real need for them right now, but we just think they're good things to have.
[00:46:43.360 --> 00:46:48.720]   So there could be hyper-localized or better APIs for location-based services, including
[00:46:48.720 --> 00:46:54.440]   indoor, very spatially aware APIs that will come into their own when they introduce something
[00:46:54.440 --> 00:46:56.600]   in a September or October event.
[00:46:56.600 --> 00:47:01.280]   Do you think developers have already been seated with these?
[00:47:01.280 --> 00:47:04.200]   There's always some favorite nation developers who do the demos.
[00:47:04.200 --> 00:47:08.240]   If they were going to do an event, they would have a demo on stage of something that shows
[00:47:08.240 --> 00:47:10.880]   off the process, like a game that shows off the process.
[00:47:10.880 --> 00:47:13.960]   And they would have been given that information maybe months ago.
[00:47:13.960 --> 00:47:16.840]   They would have a kid who they'd be brought to Cupertino and locked in a vault and told
[00:47:16.840 --> 00:47:20.640]   him, "You're 24 hours to get this app ready for demonstration."
[00:47:20.640 --> 00:47:21.640]   Yeah.
[00:47:21.640 --> 00:47:27.760]   That's why that is a good question about Apple actually pulling off a virtualized version
[00:47:27.760 --> 00:47:29.560]   of WWDC.
[00:47:29.560 --> 00:47:34.000]   Google said that they just did not have enough time to figure out how to get everybody at
[00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:38.520]   Google collaborating so fast and so effectively that they could put together all the content
[00:47:38.520 --> 00:47:42.280]   and all the programs that they needed to put together.
[00:47:42.280 --> 00:47:51.280]   Inside the virtual spaceship, we're going to see Apple figure out how to create secure
[00:47:51.280 --> 00:47:55.680]   communications between different teams so that they can continue to do at this breakneck
[00:47:55.680 --> 00:47:59.440]   pace that usually perceives WWDC, everything that needs to get done.
[00:47:59.440 --> 00:48:02.640]   I wouldn't be shocked if they simply say, "Well, we have to back off of this because
[00:48:02.640 --> 00:48:03.640]   the situation changed.
[00:48:03.640 --> 00:48:06.720]   We didn't think that would be like this, but it is like this."
[00:48:06.720 --> 00:48:07.720]   Two different.
[00:48:07.720 --> 00:48:08.720]   I mean, they did an app.
[00:48:08.720 --> 00:48:12.560]   When they were showing off the AR capabilities of the iPad, none of those apps were ready
[00:48:12.560 --> 00:48:13.560]   yet.
[00:48:13.560 --> 00:48:17.000]   And so they had a video that they put out that showed apps that you can't get right now
[00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:20.880]   and how they were using the LiDAR for things like chair placement and room mapping and all
[00:48:20.880 --> 00:48:21.880]   those things.
[00:48:21.880 --> 00:48:25.120]   And so they could have demonstrations of, I'm not going to call them fictional apps, but
[00:48:25.120 --> 00:48:29.320]   build they have internally from developers that they can show off in a video that aren't
[00:48:29.320 --> 00:48:31.520]   quite ready for download yet.
[00:48:31.520 --> 00:48:37.880]   Good article in the information yesterday, Nick Bestone and Wayne Ma, how Apple is working
[00:48:37.880 --> 00:48:43.440]   from home talking about the challenges of coming up with these new products, getting
[00:48:43.440 --> 00:48:50.840]   them out, foiled prototyping, factory photos stalled by secrecy, travel bans at slow decisions,
[00:48:50.840 --> 00:48:54.560]   the tech industry's most important hardware maker is still figuring out how to manage
[00:48:54.560 --> 00:49:00.480]   a remote workforce as COVID-19 disrupts its operations.
[00:49:00.480 --> 00:49:05.560]   It's, you know, we've actually talked about it a couple of weeks ago about Apple's secrecy
[00:49:05.560 --> 00:49:08.960]   and security making it difficult for people to take stuff home.
[00:49:08.960 --> 00:49:11.760]   It's kind of, I mean, I think these are the people who aren't used to it.
[00:49:11.760 --> 00:49:14.480]   And so they're, I don't want to call them whiniier about it, but there have been people
[00:49:14.480 --> 00:49:18.600]   who've had carries for years and like you hear the stories from retired ones like, I
[00:49:18.600 --> 00:49:20.800]   was in the room and people were knocking door, they're like, "What are you doing in there?
[00:49:20.800 --> 00:49:22.600]   And I was just testing out a device that didn't exist.
[00:49:22.600 --> 00:49:25.560]   I had to hide it and I'm never bringing something home again."
[00:49:25.560 --> 00:49:28.240]   And they all, you know, and they had safes inside their house, you know, and they were
[00:49:28.240 --> 00:49:31.000]   supposed to show the family and things recovered up.
[00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:32.480]   And that's been going on for 10 years.
[00:49:32.480 --> 00:49:37.120]   But I think it's, it's a much, that was probably managers and senior testers and people who
[00:49:37.120 --> 00:49:38.640]   were just used to doing it.
[00:49:38.640 --> 00:49:41.160]   And now more people have to do it and it's a hassle.
[00:49:41.160 --> 00:49:44.120]   And so some of them are just complaining very loudly about it and we're seeing it show
[00:49:44.120 --> 00:49:45.120]   up in paper.
[00:49:45.120 --> 00:49:50.400]   But also Apple can't send people to China to look at prototypes, to look at the manufacturing
[00:49:50.400 --> 00:49:52.640]   process to sign off.
[00:49:52.640 --> 00:49:54.240]   None of that.
[00:49:54.240 --> 00:49:58.040]   So it's not even an issue of whether there's workers in the plants.
[00:49:58.040 --> 00:50:05.560]   Apparently there are now, Foxconn says, there are, but can you even make anything yet?
[00:50:05.560 --> 00:50:06.560]   iPhone 9 is done.
[00:50:06.560 --> 00:50:07.560]   That's just a manufacturing.
[00:50:07.560 --> 00:50:08.560]   That's the only reason.
[00:50:08.560 --> 00:50:14.640]   And that's what Ming-Chi's quote saying is, yeah, it's the 5G end of year iPhone 12 or
[00:50:14.640 --> 00:50:16.320]   whatever it is, it's going to be challenged.
[00:50:16.320 --> 00:50:17.760]   And this is a heck of an excuse here.
[00:50:17.760 --> 00:50:22.520]   Like in normal years, everyone, Jim Kramer said this beautifully in a video 10 years
[00:50:22.520 --> 00:50:25.960]   ago, you want, you have to protect your shorts, you have to cover your bids.
[00:50:25.960 --> 00:50:29.520]   So you go and you tell a business plug that Apple's going to be late with an iPhone and
[00:50:29.520 --> 00:50:30.520]   they love those stories.
[00:50:30.520 --> 00:50:31.520]   They don't even ask any questions.
[00:50:31.520 --> 00:50:32.520]   Right.
[00:50:32.520 --> 00:50:35.480]   They just run them and then the stock goes down and you're great.
[00:50:35.480 --> 00:50:39.960]   So every year we get this and once in a very long while the broken clock is right and it's
[00:50:39.960 --> 00:50:42.240]   something like the China market collapses.
[00:50:42.240 --> 00:50:46.320]   This year though, it's like, I want to say that COVID is complete cover for this, but
[00:50:46.320 --> 00:50:49.600]   no one has any expectations for what's going to ship and when.
[00:50:49.600 --> 00:50:51.240]   And so I don't think they're under the same price.
[00:50:51.240 --> 00:50:52.640]   I don't even think Apple knows.
[00:50:52.640 --> 00:50:53.960]   I mean, I mean, I don't.
[00:50:53.960 --> 00:50:58.240]   So like if there's a year that the iPhone ships late, like if Apple couldn't do it on
[00:50:58.240 --> 00:51:00.640]   time and it was a normal year, it'd be a huge story.
[00:51:00.640 --> 00:51:01.640]   It's not a story of this year.
[00:51:01.640 --> 00:51:04.640]   If my phone ships late is one of many normal.
[00:51:04.640 --> 00:51:05.640]   Everything.
[00:51:05.640 --> 00:51:06.640]   Yeah.
[00:51:06.640 --> 00:51:08.480]   As somebody in the chat room says, welcome to the new normal.
[00:51:08.480 --> 00:51:09.480]   Yeah.
[00:51:09.480 --> 00:51:17.560]   And actually, completely side note, but I feel like in a way, this isn't a bad thing.
[00:51:17.560 --> 00:51:23.840]   We've been in this crazy cycle of, you know, get the next new shiny out.
[00:51:23.840 --> 00:51:29.400]   And we've been as a economy and as users and especially as tech journalists, very ADD
[00:51:29.400 --> 00:51:36.080]   about all this, taking a pause and taking a breath actually feels okay.
[00:51:36.080 --> 00:51:37.880]   Maybe even good for us.
[00:51:37.880 --> 00:51:38.880]   Andy, I don't know.
[00:51:38.880 --> 00:51:40.560]   We've Laurie and I only have to deal with too.
[00:51:40.560 --> 00:51:41.560]   So I don't know.
[00:51:41.560 --> 00:51:42.560]   Yeah.
[00:51:42.560 --> 00:51:51.640]   But one aspect of this is that on all aspects of daily life, it's the these quarantines
[00:51:51.640 --> 00:51:53.640]   are going on for months.
[00:51:53.640 --> 00:51:59.920]   Optimistically, I think the most optimistic practical thing I've seen has been July before
[00:51:59.920 --> 00:52:03.040]   things can really start to get back to normal.
[00:52:03.040 --> 00:52:08.280]   And that's several months in which people break habits that they've been engaged in
[00:52:08.280 --> 00:52:11.160]   automatically for decades, possibly.
[00:52:11.160 --> 00:52:16.280]   So what happens when we just sort of break people from the cycle of anticipating that
[00:52:16.280 --> 00:52:18.160]   a new phone is going to be out in September.
[00:52:18.160 --> 00:52:22.080]   So I'm going to be I'm going to swap out my old phone for a new phone.
[00:52:22.080 --> 00:52:26.680]   What happens when they don't get the new phone and they realize that actually my old phone
[00:52:26.680 --> 00:52:28.320]   is still working just fine.
[00:52:28.320 --> 00:52:29.320]   That's the real risk, isn't it?
[00:52:29.320 --> 00:52:31.600]   The people who go, I'm the yearly update programs.
[00:52:31.600 --> 00:52:32.600]   What are they going to do?
[00:52:32.600 --> 00:52:35.320]   You bought the yearly update program for your iPhone.
[00:52:35.320 --> 00:52:36.320]   Now it's September.
[00:52:36.320 --> 00:52:37.320]   Where's my iPhone?
[00:52:37.320 --> 00:52:38.920]   Yeah, where's my refund?
[00:52:38.920 --> 00:52:39.920]   Yeah.
[00:52:39.920 --> 00:52:40.920]   Yeah.
[00:52:40.920 --> 00:52:43.680]   Well, you get a discount on the 12 months or?
[00:52:43.680 --> 00:52:44.680]   It does.
[00:52:44.680 --> 00:52:45.680]   Yeah.
[00:52:45.680 --> 00:52:46.680]   And I think there's a risk.
[00:52:46.680 --> 00:52:50.560]   You know, we've talked in other shows about the risk to motion picture theaters, movie
[00:52:50.560 --> 00:52:54.600]   theaters that people will say, I don't really need to go to the movies anymore.
[00:52:54.600 --> 00:52:58.320]   I think society might change dramatically, drastically.
[00:52:58.320 --> 00:53:03.680]   And I think it could be a huge difference from the point of view of Apple.
[00:53:03.680 --> 00:53:07.560]   The flagship phone business, like beyond just Apple is very much like big blockbuster
[00:53:07.560 --> 00:53:08.560]   movies.
[00:53:08.560 --> 00:53:09.760]   There is a new device comes out.
[00:53:09.760 --> 00:53:13.280]   There's a huge spike in sales and then it trails off to the rest of the year until it's
[00:53:13.280 --> 00:53:15.880]   very minimal sales when everyone's expecting the new one.
[00:53:15.880 --> 00:53:16.880]   It's not a steady thing.
[00:53:16.880 --> 00:53:20.520]   It's not like you go like, nobody's like, oh, the new Ford, the 2020 pickups about to
[00:53:20.520 --> 00:53:21.520]   drop.
[00:53:21.520 --> 00:53:22.520]   Everyone's waiting outside for it.
[00:53:22.520 --> 00:53:25.280]   Like they have into the years, like it's a very different market.
[00:53:25.280 --> 00:53:27.400]   This is still a very hit driven market.
[00:53:27.400 --> 00:53:30.960]   And that's the big question is that Apple doesn't really need a new iPhone every year,
[00:53:30.960 --> 00:53:35.360]   but they do because if you're ready to buy an iPhone, if it's been two, three, four years
[00:53:35.360 --> 00:53:37.520]   and you're ready, they want you to get the latest one.
[00:53:37.520 --> 00:53:39.600]   They don't want you to have to get an iPhone that's three years old and you're going to
[00:53:39.600 --> 00:53:40.600]   keep it for three years.
[00:53:40.600 --> 00:53:42.400]   Suddenly it's a six year old iPhone.
[00:53:42.400 --> 00:53:46.760]   Whenever you buy it, they want you to have like three, four, five good years on that phone.
[00:53:46.760 --> 00:53:50.680]   But also for the holidays, they're counting on all that, essentially free marketing of,
[00:53:50.680 --> 00:53:54.560]   oh, wow, there's a new iPhone, there's a new Galaxy Note, there's a new Pixel.
[00:53:54.560 --> 00:53:58.920]   Like all of these companies have just, that is how they are used to marketing these phones.
[00:53:58.920 --> 00:54:02.480]   And if they can't deliver that for the holidays or if people aren't interested in that for
[00:54:02.480 --> 00:54:05.360]   the holidays, that whole industry upends.
[00:54:05.360 --> 00:54:09.720]   Don't think it's a bad thing.
[00:54:09.720 --> 00:54:13.760]   Yeah, it's, change is neither good nor bad.
[00:54:13.760 --> 00:54:19.520]   It just simply is, just like the color red is a great color for a sports car, bad, bad
[00:54:19.520 --> 00:54:23.280]   color for, for someone who is attending a funeral.
[00:54:23.280 --> 00:54:24.480]   It just is.
[00:54:24.480 --> 00:54:30.480]   And so we can't help but wonder a year from now, what habits do we decide to come back
[00:54:30.480 --> 00:54:31.480]   to?
[00:54:31.480 --> 00:54:38.320]   What do we reject because we just discover we didn't need it anymore versus how when
[00:54:38.320 --> 00:54:43.000]   people discover that, hey, I was able to work from home and it actually worked out great.
[00:54:43.000 --> 00:54:48.960]   And now can I, particularly if I'm a very, very much in demand management person or engineer,
[00:54:48.960 --> 00:54:52.800]   can I simply say as part of my employment package, my contract, I insist that I only have to
[00:54:52.800 --> 00:54:55.960]   come into the office two days, two days a week.
[00:54:55.960 --> 00:55:00.840]   And if so, if that happens, what does Apple do with this enormous wedding ring they plopped
[00:55:00.840 --> 00:55:07.920]   in the middle is, you can say that though, as a happy, confirmed old introvert, I think
[00:55:07.920 --> 00:55:12.040]   there's going to be just as many, if not more people say, I will never do that again.
[00:55:12.040 --> 00:55:13.120]   Take me to work.
[00:55:13.120 --> 00:55:14.680]   I got to get to work.
[00:55:14.680 --> 00:55:15.680]   I want to work.
[00:55:15.680 --> 00:55:20.840]   There's a lot of people that have been telling me how bored they are and how they, they hate
[00:55:20.840 --> 00:55:22.520]   that they have to work from home.
[00:55:22.520 --> 00:55:26.960]   And these are all people that told me, oh, I'm so jealous that you get to work from home.
[00:55:26.960 --> 00:55:28.840]   Once they do it, it's really true.
[00:55:28.840 --> 00:55:30.560]   Yes, it's a different story.
[00:55:30.560 --> 00:55:31.560]   Yeah.
[00:55:31.560 --> 00:55:33.360]   Notice, by the way, I'm coming in here.
[00:55:33.360 --> 00:55:37.960]   I love all the parents saying that teachers should be paid a million dollars.
[00:55:37.960 --> 00:55:40.800]   I have never understood that better than they do right now.
[00:55:40.800 --> 00:55:41.800]   Yeah.
[00:55:41.800 --> 00:55:42.800]   Set as a man who has no kids.
[00:55:42.800 --> 00:55:43.800]   You don't even know the half of it.
[00:55:43.800 --> 00:55:44.800]   I mean, you're just kids.
[00:55:44.800 --> 00:55:50.160]   I'm watching everyone on the internet go, my God, we have to homeschool my kids.
[00:55:50.160 --> 00:55:52.040]   But this is the hardest job I've ever had.
[00:55:52.040 --> 00:55:53.520]   Why aren't you made up the others?
[00:55:53.520 --> 00:56:00.440]   I had no idea how dumb my kids actually were until I had to teach them myself.
[00:56:00.440 --> 00:56:04.440]   Or until I didn't realize how dumb I was until I realized I didn't have no idea what my
[00:56:04.440 --> 00:56:06.000]   kids are learning.
[00:56:06.000 --> 00:56:10.520]   It may be the case that, you know, when this is over, at some point it will be, everything
[00:56:10.520 --> 00:56:15.000]   will go back exactly as it was that people will be thronging to the movie theaters, can't
[00:56:15.000 --> 00:56:16.680]   wait to get back to the office.
[00:56:16.680 --> 00:56:17.680]   Restaurants will be full.
[00:56:17.680 --> 00:56:20.680]   And I think that's, you know, in a lot of respects that's probably true.
[00:56:20.680 --> 00:56:23.640]   But there will be some long term overhang here.
[00:56:23.640 --> 00:56:25.840]   Some of it will be PTSD.
[00:56:25.840 --> 00:56:27.880]   I mean, I don't think I'm not a true.
[00:56:27.880 --> 00:56:31.800]   But I have a feeling the rest of my life I'm going to be like people survive the depression.
[00:56:31.800 --> 00:56:35.160]   I'm going to be saying, are you going to wash your hands before you touch that?
[00:56:35.160 --> 00:56:36.160]   You know, just coughs.
[00:56:36.160 --> 00:56:40.120]   My question is, is it like those sci-fi movies where you've lived your entire life underground
[00:56:40.120 --> 00:56:44.240]   because it's scary outside and then someone tells you, no, it's a lie outside is recovered.
[00:56:44.240 --> 00:56:45.840]   They just don't want to give up their power.
[00:56:45.840 --> 00:56:48.840]   When you go outside and you look, are you terrified of the sky?
[00:56:48.840 --> 00:56:50.880]   Or are you exuberant and happy?
[00:56:50.880 --> 00:56:51.880]   Now I'm just, I'm nervous.
[00:56:51.880 --> 00:56:53.360]   I go outside and I don't want to touch anything.
[00:56:53.360 --> 00:56:57.040]   And people are looking at me and I'm like socially distant enough and who's coughing and it's
[00:56:57.040 --> 00:56:58.600]   just an incredible amount of stress.
[00:56:58.600 --> 00:56:59.600]   And is that going to stay?
[00:56:59.600 --> 00:57:02.400]   Or am I going to go outside and just breathe in and start running again?
[00:57:02.400 --> 00:57:04.080]   Like I was four year old.
[00:57:04.080 --> 00:57:06.880]   I'm kind of concerned about what this is going to do to labor.
[00:57:06.880 --> 00:57:07.880]   I'll make the sharks.
[00:57:07.880 --> 00:57:10.280]   I know this isn't, you know, post a cop pop book.
[00:57:10.280 --> 00:57:11.280]   No, no, it's good.
[00:57:11.280 --> 00:57:12.920]   I think there's some stuff to talk about.
[00:57:12.920 --> 00:57:13.920]   I don't mind that.
[00:57:13.920 --> 00:57:14.920]   Yeah.
[00:57:14.920 --> 00:57:20.280]   I think that there's a chance that people who run corporations are going to be taking a
[00:57:20.280 --> 00:57:25.200]   very, very hard look at these numbers and realize that, well, we got, we had a sharp
[00:57:25.200 --> 00:57:27.960]   production product in productive hours.
[00:57:27.960 --> 00:57:33.240]   But nonetheless, we got, we didn't, we didn't get as much done as we were, we've hoped,
[00:57:33.240 --> 00:57:36.880]   but it is encouraging to make us think that we could actually double up and triple up certain
[00:57:36.880 --> 00:57:37.880]   jobs here.
[00:57:37.880 --> 00:57:43.320]   Also, there are a lot of jobs that we thought had to be done by a fully salaried person inside
[00:57:43.320 --> 00:57:44.320]   an office.
[00:57:44.320 --> 00:57:49.040]   Perhaps we can actually now put these jobs out to bid to contractors and make even our
[00:57:49.040 --> 00:57:51.680]   middle management part of the gig economy.
[00:57:51.680 --> 00:57:58.120]   So it's, it's, it's any time that I've said this before that if you, the reason why self-driving
[00:57:58.120 --> 00:58:03.680]   cars are getting billions and billions of dollars on investment and other more promising and
[00:58:03.680 --> 00:58:07.960]   more practical technologies are kind of dying on the vine is because anytime that you come
[00:58:07.960 --> 00:58:14.000]   up with a technology that could allow corporations to fire lots of employees, they're going to
[00:58:14.000 --> 00:58:16.120]   invest the hell in that and develop that.
[00:58:16.120 --> 00:58:20.080]   And so if you get a technology that means you no longer have to hire drivers, you no
[00:58:20.080 --> 00:58:23.760]   longer have to have truckers, you no longer have to have all of these people that you
[00:58:23.760 --> 00:58:28.320]   probably didn't treat very well or pay very well anyway, this is a technology they desperately
[00:58:28.320 --> 00:58:29.320]   want.
[00:58:29.320 --> 00:58:36.280]   So working remotely from home could be both a life saving thing for, for the American
[00:58:36.280 --> 00:58:40.780]   worker and the worldwide worker or could just simply say, well, since we, since we put in
[00:58:40.780 --> 00:58:47.120]   all this infrastructure for allowing people to work from wherever they are, let's just
[00:58:47.120 --> 00:58:51.840]   contact some people in India and Pakistan and see if they can actually do these spreadsheets
[00:58:51.840 --> 00:58:56.840]   and sell these forms for us just as well as someone that we were paying $90,000 a year.
[00:58:56.840 --> 00:59:01.080]   So it's, it's a very interesting world.
[00:59:01.080 --> 00:59:02.920]   We have our timeline.
[00:59:02.920 --> 00:59:03.920]   We have emerged into.
[00:59:03.920 --> 00:59:06.720]   I'd soap my local sub shop stays in business.
[00:59:06.720 --> 00:59:08.360]   I'm all over the floor.
[00:59:08.360 --> 00:59:09.960]   My expectations are low.
[00:59:09.960 --> 00:59:12.640]   I'm a simple man with simple needs.
[00:59:12.640 --> 00:59:16.280]   I just need a toasted sub once in a while.
[00:59:16.280 --> 00:59:21.080]   Yeah, I, I feel like there are two things going on.
[00:59:21.080 --> 00:59:23.600]   There's a lot of opportunism, unfortunately.
[00:59:23.600 --> 00:59:24.600]   Yes.
[00:59:24.600 --> 00:59:26.280]   A lot of, I mean, not just hackers too.
[00:59:26.280 --> 00:59:30.880]   There are a lot of companies who are taking this as an opportunity has nothing to do with
[00:59:30.880 --> 00:59:33.280]   the virus or, or, or, or lockdown.
[00:59:33.280 --> 00:59:36.160]   It's just, yeah, we're a gear to some people now.
[00:59:36.160 --> 00:59:37.160]   Yeah.
[00:59:37.160 --> 00:59:38.680]   Um, so I think there's some of that.
[00:59:38.680 --> 00:59:43.600]   Then there's also some willingness to look at a new way of being in the, I don't know,
[00:59:43.600 --> 00:59:45.400]   the world, it's so unpredictable.
[00:59:45.400 --> 00:59:46.400]   Yeah.
[00:59:46.400 --> 00:59:50.000]   I am hoping that it causes a lot of people who are on the fence to look around and say,
[00:59:50.000 --> 00:59:53.840]   well, actually we did have socialized medicine going there for a few months.
[00:59:53.840 --> 00:59:58.800]   And we did actually have a guaranteed basic monthly rate monthly wage for a lot of our
[00:59:58.800 --> 00:59:59.800]   citizens.
[00:59:59.800 --> 01:00:04.120]   Not only did the, not only did the economy not tank, it actually saved the economy.
[01:00:04.120 --> 01:00:05.600]   And now the economy is thriving.
[01:00:05.600 --> 01:00:07.400]   Well, that remains to be seen.
[01:00:07.400 --> 01:00:10.520]   It's a two trillion dollar bill.
[01:00:10.520 --> 01:00:14.640]   This is, but we, you know, we, we've signed checks that big, that big for things that
[01:00:14.640 --> 01:00:17.320]   were way, way less productive.
[01:00:17.320 --> 01:00:22.680]   And it's going to be interesting to see if a lot of people that, basically the, I wouldn't
[01:00:22.680 --> 01:00:26.480]   say that the workers rising up throwing down their tools, breaking their chains and storming
[01:00:26.480 --> 01:00:27.480]   the Republic.
[01:00:27.480 --> 01:00:30.800]   I'm, but I'm basically saying that a lot of people are saying, well, why weren't we demanding
[01:00:30.800 --> 01:00:31.800]   this before?
[01:00:31.800 --> 01:00:36.280]   Why weren't we saying that we get to take two weeks off with pay to avoid infecting other
[01:00:36.280 --> 01:00:38.360]   people and bring our diseases to other people?
[01:00:38.360 --> 01:00:39.360]   Exactly.
[01:00:39.360 --> 01:00:43.520]   And they'll start voting for the, for the politicians who actually want to help make that
[01:00:43.520 --> 01:00:44.880]   thing a real look at Renee.
[01:00:44.880 --> 01:00:47.480]   I mean, Renee, you can do what you're doing.
[01:00:47.480 --> 01:00:48.480]   Yes.
[01:00:48.480 --> 01:00:51.520]   Because the one thing you don't have to worry about is your healthcare from an employer.
[01:00:51.520 --> 01:00:52.520]   Yeah.
[01:00:52.520 --> 01:00:53.520]   Yeah.
[01:00:53.520 --> 01:00:54.520]   No, absolutely.
[01:00:54.520 --> 01:00:57.280]   I forget what company it was, but they, someone leaked a memo from one of the big companies
[01:00:57.280 --> 01:01:01.600]   that was laying people off and it said, you know, like in Europe, blah, blah, blah in
[01:01:01.600 --> 01:01:05.640]   Canada, in other countries, in the US, we've made special provisions for healthcare for
[01:01:05.640 --> 01:01:06.640]   the next 30 days.
[01:01:06.640 --> 01:01:07.640]   And good luck.
[01:01:07.640 --> 01:01:08.640]   And good luck.
[01:01:08.640 --> 01:01:09.640]   Like, wow.
[01:01:09.640 --> 01:01:13.880]   And it is, it is an unbelievable sense that like empowerment that I don't, I don't have
[01:01:13.880 --> 01:01:15.600]   to worry about losing my house if I get sick.
[01:01:15.600 --> 01:01:16.600]   Right.
[01:01:16.600 --> 01:01:17.760]   That's the terms I think about it in.
[01:01:17.760 --> 01:01:18.760]   No.
[01:01:18.760 --> 01:01:22.800]   There's certainly some cracks in the system that are being exposed at the moment.
[01:01:22.800 --> 01:01:24.040]   Was that old joke, right?
[01:01:24.040 --> 01:01:27.600]   There are no, there are no atheists in a foxhole and no libertarians in a, in a pandemic.
[01:01:27.600 --> 01:01:28.600]   Oh, I like it.
[01:01:28.600 --> 01:01:30.600]   I have an old joke.
[01:01:30.600 --> 01:01:31.600]   Yeah.
[01:01:31.600 --> 01:01:32.600]   Was that from 1918?
[01:01:32.600 --> 01:01:34.400]   Probably it's right from mash.
[01:01:34.400 --> 01:01:37.400]   I know about the fox hole thing.
[01:01:37.400 --> 01:01:38.400]   Let's take a break.
[01:01:38.400 --> 01:01:42.320]   Our show today brought to you by worldwide technology.
[01:01:42.320 --> 01:01:46.480]   It was my last trip ever, at least for a little while.
[01:01:46.480 --> 01:01:50.280]   Anyway, to St. Louis to see their advanced technology center last month.
[01:01:50.280 --> 01:01:51.280]   Wow.
[01:01:51.280 --> 01:01:52.280]   I was so blown away.
[01:01:52.280 --> 01:01:54.160]   I'm actually really glad that we got to go.
[01:01:54.160 --> 01:01:56.160]   Now we also met a lot of great fans.
[01:01:56.160 --> 01:02:01.760]   And I was told one thing by almost everybody I met in St. Louis, WWT is a great corporate
[01:02:01.760 --> 01:02:02.760]   citizen.
[01:02:02.760 --> 01:02:04.640]   They brought the Major League soccer team there.
[01:02:04.640 --> 01:02:07.240]   They're part owners of some other sports franchises.
[01:02:07.240 --> 01:02:11.400]   They really love St. Louis and St. Louis loves WWT.
[01:02:11.400 --> 01:02:14.800]   Actually, let's be honest.
[01:02:14.800 --> 01:02:19.320]   WWT's customers love worldwide technology.
[01:02:19.320 --> 01:02:23.800]   This episode brought to you by worldwide technology and app dynamics.
[01:02:23.800 --> 01:02:27.240]   Now we've talked a lot about the advanced technology center, about what worldwide tech
[01:02:27.240 --> 01:02:29.600]   does for their enterprise clients.
[01:02:29.600 --> 01:02:33.680]   But when we got there, they showed us all the app stuff they're doing.
[01:02:33.680 --> 01:02:36.560]   And Lisa and I said, we got to talk about that too.
[01:02:36.560 --> 01:02:38.000]   This is amazing.
[01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:43.760]   If you would love to have an application to deliver to your customers, WWT offers solutions
[01:02:43.760 --> 01:02:45.720]   that will transform your business.
[01:02:45.720 --> 01:02:51.520]   And I know how important this is because we did at one point hire a lesser company to
[01:02:51.520 --> 01:02:53.160]   do an app for us.
[01:02:53.160 --> 01:02:57.760]   $80,000 later, we had nothing I would ever ship to any of you.
[01:02:57.760 --> 01:02:58.760]   I would never.
[01:02:58.760 --> 01:03:00.400]   So that's why we don't have an app.
[01:03:00.400 --> 01:03:05.560]   I think we're going to talk to WWT because they have solutions to transform.
[01:03:05.560 --> 01:03:08.720]   The great software, of course, can change lives.
[01:03:08.720 --> 01:03:13.080]   WWT is driven as a custom application design and development company.
[01:03:13.080 --> 01:03:16.520]   A whole new part of their business, I had no idea about.
[01:03:16.520 --> 01:03:20.040]   They'll help you from the very first moment.
[01:03:20.040 --> 01:03:26.640]   I identify specific business needs, how to approach problems, customers and clients have
[01:03:26.640 --> 01:03:28.120]   in new ways.
[01:03:28.120 --> 01:03:32.200]   And they can create, I've seen the apps, they made beautiful software solutions that make
[01:03:32.200 --> 01:03:33.800]   an impact.
[01:03:33.800 --> 01:03:38.440]   This is a company that will focus exactly on what you need on the specifications you
[01:03:38.440 --> 01:03:39.440]   want.
[01:03:39.440 --> 01:03:42.680]   They'll help you design it from the ground up.
[01:03:42.680 --> 01:03:47.160]   Their team at WWT provides resources and platforms to make it possible.
[01:03:47.160 --> 01:03:51.120]   And because they have over two decades of experience, a proven track record, they've
[01:03:51.120 --> 01:03:53.600]   been doing an absence before there were apps.
[01:03:53.600 --> 01:03:56.480]   WWT, I'll give you an example, worked with a healthcare organization.
[01:03:56.480 --> 01:04:01.200]   We don't have to mention any names to connect medical teams from their care center to patients
[01:04:01.200 --> 01:04:02.200]   at home.
[01:04:02.200 --> 01:04:04.200]   Kind of timely.
[01:04:04.200 --> 01:04:09.120]   WWT created a custom software app where care teams could interface with patients within
[01:04:09.120 --> 01:04:10.120]   a year.
[01:04:10.120 --> 01:04:15.680]   They started seeing amazing results, 50% reduction in preventable readmissions for engagement
[01:04:15.680 --> 01:04:22.480]   at home patients, 35% fewer days spent in the hospital with virtual care, 60% fewer
[01:04:22.480 --> 01:04:25.880]   septic shock deaths, it patients being treated remotely.
[01:04:25.880 --> 01:04:31.720]   I mean, this was an example of an app that they designed for this healthcare company that
[01:04:31.720 --> 01:04:33.600]   made a huge difference.
[01:04:33.600 --> 01:04:39.360]   I'll give you another example, WWT worked with a rental car company to produce their mobile
[01:04:39.360 --> 01:04:44.920]   app, gave them an much improved customer car rental experience, lets customers in the
[01:04:44.920 --> 01:04:49.760]   app make reservations, perform check-ins and return without waiting in line.
[01:04:49.760 --> 01:04:53.120]   You'd know the name of the company, I don't want to say it, but I'm telling you, these
[01:04:53.120 --> 01:04:56.680]   guys have done some of the best apps, many apps you've used.
[01:04:56.680 --> 01:05:00.080]   How about the one with the grocery retailer?
[01:05:00.080 --> 01:05:03.880]   They improved the customer experience, they had an app, it wasn't great.
[01:05:03.880 --> 01:05:11.480]   So they sat down with WWT and went through a design process, going through ideation, innovation
[01:05:11.480 --> 01:05:16.720]   and creative work to create the ultimate customer experience.
[01:05:16.720 --> 01:05:21.480]   And they've hit those two and three year goals within less than a year, thanks to WWT.
[01:05:21.480 --> 01:05:25.760]   You want your customers to be able to use your app, you want them to love your app, you
[01:05:25.760 --> 01:05:29.040]   want to put something in their hands that exceeds their expectations and that's what
[01:05:29.040 --> 01:05:30.640]   WWT does.
[01:05:30.640 --> 01:05:34.520]   They're kings of Agile by the way, they do Agile training for a lot of companies, they
[01:05:34.520 --> 01:05:40.080]   do Agile software development from beginning to end, from planning and ideation to delivery,
[01:05:40.080 --> 01:05:44.800]   that way they get solutions for a variety of end users that are better than what they
[01:05:44.800 --> 01:05:51.320]   planned, their customers are always happy and they do it more efficiently and more effectively.
[01:05:51.320 --> 01:05:57.240]   They do DevOps, so a lot of the apps they do are custom apps for DevOps driving business
[01:05:57.240 --> 01:06:02.360]   outcomes by evaluating, designing, implementing and operating with tools to enhance your operational
[01:06:02.360 --> 01:06:03.360]   efficiency.
[01:06:03.360 --> 01:06:07.600]   A lot of times DevOps teams are required to write their own tools, you could get some help,
[01:06:07.600 --> 01:06:09.360]   make it a really nice app.
[01:06:09.360 --> 01:06:14.920]   And for container platforms, they can rapidly create services that scale and perform by designing,
[01:06:14.920 --> 01:06:19.120]   architecting and implementing cloud native apps in a natural fashion.
[01:06:19.120 --> 01:06:24.400]   This is a whole different area that I didn't even know about till we got out there to St.
[01:06:24.400 --> 01:06:27.040]   Louis, I'm just blown away.
[01:06:27.040 --> 01:06:30.120]   WWT is the best, transform your business today with WWT.
[01:06:30.120 --> 01:06:35.360]   They can help you do it with apps that you'll great user experiences, attract new clients
[01:06:35.360 --> 01:06:37.040]   and increase customer value.
[01:06:37.040 --> 01:06:40.640]   They could do it in so many ways and don't forget the Advanced Technology Center, the
[01:06:40.640 --> 01:06:41.640]   ATC.
[01:06:41.640 --> 01:06:46.800]   You'll find out more about all of this by going to www.wt.com/twit1.
[01:06:46.800 --> 01:06:56.400]   All one word, worldwide technology delivering business outcomes and modernizing IT infrastructure.
[01:06:56.400 --> 01:06:57.400]   Good partners.
[01:06:57.400 --> 01:07:00.480]   They're great for you as a partner and they're great for us as a partner.
[01:07:00.480 --> 01:07:01.960]   Thank you, WWT.
[01:07:01.960 --> 01:07:06.040]   And you help us out when you go to that special address that lets them know they saw it here.
[01:07:06.040 --> 01:07:08.040]   www.wt.com/twit1.
[01:07:08.040 --> 01:07:21.400]   Apple has a new coronavirus app which is information we've all had access to all along but coming
[01:07:21.400 --> 01:07:25.240]   from Apple is it more trusted, more valuable, the fact that it's on your phone.
[01:07:25.240 --> 01:07:28.400]   You still have to download it, they didn't push it out.
[01:07:28.400 --> 01:07:31.200]   There's also a little bit of sight that you can go to.
[01:07:31.200 --> 01:07:35.000]   Right, www.wt.com/covid19.
[01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:36.000]   What is it?
[01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:37.000]   I don't remember.
[01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:40.360]   I can type it in and see.
[01:07:40.360 --> 01:07:42.280]   I bet that would work.
[01:07:42.280 --> 01:07:44.440]   Obviously I haven't looked it up.
[01:07:44.440 --> 01:07:45.960]   It doesn't work by the domain.
[01:07:45.960 --> 01:07:47.560]   I don't feel compelled to.
[01:07:47.560 --> 01:07:49.520]   Yes, slash COVID-19.
[01:07:49.520 --> 01:07:50.520]   Dash 19.
[01:07:50.520 --> 01:07:55.560]   So why are they doing this?
[01:07:55.560 --> 01:07:57.560]   To do something?
[01:07:57.560 --> 01:08:05.400]   I think there's a lot of misinformation that has been out in the world and confusion.
[01:08:05.400 --> 01:08:07.120]   Is it Apple's job?
[01:08:07.120 --> 01:08:08.440]   I mean, they're tech companies.
[01:08:08.440 --> 01:08:09.440]   Is it their job?
[01:08:09.440 --> 01:08:11.280]   Shouldn't the CDC's website be in the Fed?
[01:08:11.280 --> 01:08:13.080]   They're an American tech company, Leo.
[01:08:13.080 --> 01:08:17.560]   I hate to put it in those terms but there's a lot of abdication to enterprise in the US,
[01:08:17.560 --> 01:08:20.120]   especially in the last 20, 30 years.
[01:08:20.120 --> 01:08:21.120]   That's a good point.
[01:08:21.120 --> 01:08:22.120]   I think a lot of them like any.
[01:08:22.120 --> 01:08:23.120]   I'm sure.
[01:08:23.120 --> 01:08:24.120]   I think in England, sorry.
[01:08:24.120 --> 01:08:25.120]   I'm Leo actually.
[01:08:25.120 --> 01:08:29.320]   I'm sure that you've been receiving emails from all of the different companies that you
[01:08:29.320 --> 01:08:35.160]   have some sort of information with and here's the information about what we're doing about
[01:08:35.160 --> 01:08:36.160]   COVID-19.
[01:08:36.160 --> 01:08:40.440]   So this is Apple's way of doing that, of like providing some information.
[01:08:40.440 --> 01:08:42.560]   And I think that it makes them look good.
[01:08:42.560 --> 01:08:47.800]   The more these organizations get together and they say, we're trying to combat misinformation
[01:08:47.800 --> 01:08:53.960]   or confusing information by pointing you to the exact information that you need to help
[01:08:53.960 --> 01:08:56.920]   you get through this situation.
[01:08:56.920 --> 01:08:58.120]   They look good.
[01:08:58.120 --> 01:09:00.200]   We like that.
[01:09:00.200 --> 01:09:02.720]   It's a benefit to them to have that kind of information.
[01:09:02.720 --> 01:09:07.920]   It feels like though, Apple has a constituency.
[01:09:07.920 --> 01:09:13.160]   Like, well, we have to do this because there's some of our customers expect us to do this
[01:09:13.160 --> 01:09:16.440]   as opposed to the CDC or the federal government.
[01:09:16.440 --> 01:09:18.720]   That's a little weird to me.
[01:09:18.720 --> 01:09:22.240]   But I think going back to what I was just saying before, like in a lot of countries,
[01:09:22.240 --> 01:09:26.000]   like England, the National Health Service put out an app and in Canada, everything is
[01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:27.000]   coming from the government.
[01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:31.400]   But in the US, they're waiting for companies to donate masks.
[01:09:31.400 --> 01:09:35.320]   And it seems like there's a vacuum of leadership in companies are not only trying to fill it,
[01:09:35.320 --> 01:09:37.720]   but are expected in a way to fill it.
[01:09:37.720 --> 01:09:40.640]   And Apple is looking around and going, where is this information?
[01:09:40.640 --> 01:09:41.640]   We're curating out.
[01:09:41.640 --> 01:09:43.160]   All right, fine.
[01:09:43.160 --> 01:09:46.680]   You know, we're a company that has deep social commitments and we believe in a bunch of
[01:09:46.680 --> 01:09:49.400]   civil things and if nobody else is doing it, we'll just do it.
[01:09:49.400 --> 01:09:50.760]   Yeah, I mean, I'm not knocking it.
[01:09:50.760 --> 01:09:51.760]   It's a good thing to have.
[01:09:51.760 --> 01:09:52.760]   It's a good tool.
[01:09:52.760 --> 01:09:55.080]   As many places as can have it should have it.
[01:09:55.080 --> 01:09:56.720]   It just feels odd to me.
[01:09:56.720 --> 01:10:01.280]   I mean, where's there's the IBM COVID page or the Facebook?
[01:10:01.280 --> 01:10:07.040]   Well, Facebook has it because there's social media, but you know, where's the website?
[01:10:07.040 --> 01:10:08.040]   Yeah.
[01:10:08.040 --> 01:10:10.040]   No, they actually do.
[01:10:10.040 --> 01:10:12.040]   He's the White House, right?
[01:10:12.040 --> 01:10:13.680]   To say, hey, we see we're good.
[01:10:13.680 --> 01:10:15.840]   We're doing something because they're expecting companies to do it.
[01:10:15.840 --> 01:10:16.840]   Right.
[01:10:16.840 --> 01:10:17.840]   Yeah, because of that expectation.
[01:10:17.840 --> 01:10:18.840]   Yeah.
[01:10:18.840 --> 01:10:23.820]   Well, not only not only that, but there is I really do think that there is at the executive
[01:10:23.820 --> 01:10:28.600]   levels of most huge corporations, there still is that sort of meme of, like, I got into
[01:10:28.600 --> 01:10:31.120]   this business to change the world.
[01:10:31.120 --> 01:10:35.640]   And maybe they did start saying that after they got their first 30 million in options.
[01:10:35.640 --> 01:10:42.300]   But there is, you have, if you are a high up at Google, at Facebook, at Twitter, at particularly
[01:10:42.300 --> 01:10:47.040]   at Apple, and you're faced with a situation like this pandemic.
[01:10:47.040 --> 01:10:52.880]   And you can just spend an hour doodling on an Appian or it'll be on an iPad, of course,
[01:10:52.880 --> 01:10:57.980]   that it'll be so easy for us to create a really, really good responsive website that
[01:10:57.980 --> 01:11:03.500]   unlike some of Google's resources, don't require a log in of any kind.
[01:11:03.500 --> 01:11:06.300]   Don't take in any information, rekind.
[01:11:06.300 --> 01:11:09.540]   Please tell them, then tell their boss, please tell us we can do that.
[01:11:09.540 --> 01:11:11.180]   No, I feel like it's peculiar.
[01:11:11.180 --> 01:11:12.860]   It's peculiar to the tech industry.
[01:11:12.860 --> 01:11:13.860]   You don't see here.
[01:11:13.860 --> 01:11:15.860]   If I go to Pepsi, if I go to Pepsi.com/COVID19.
[01:11:15.860 --> 01:11:21.140]   Well, they're making sugar while you know, but I'm just saying this is a peculiar point
[01:11:21.140 --> 01:11:29.400]   of view of the tech industry that somehow we are stewards of the society or something.
[01:11:29.400 --> 01:11:30.400]   Look at Bill Gates.
[01:11:30.400 --> 01:11:31.400]   He's everywhere.
[01:11:31.400 --> 01:11:32.400]   He's like this TV on TV.
[01:11:32.400 --> 01:11:38.480]   And then Bill, that's different because this has always been his thing, right?
[01:11:38.480 --> 01:11:39.560]   Is public health.
[01:11:39.560 --> 01:11:40.560]   That's his charity.
[01:11:40.560 --> 01:11:42.320]   That's so I understand that.
[01:11:42.320 --> 01:11:46.160]   But there's also a difference in that tech companies are in a position because they are
[01:11:46.160 --> 01:11:50.800]   the communications network or the world because of the dissemination grid for information and
[01:11:50.800 --> 01:11:54.740]   for people who are looking for reassurance and looking for solutions.
[01:11:54.740 --> 01:11:56.220]   They were going to help people find it.
[01:11:56.220 --> 01:11:58.100]   They're in a position to do that sort of thing.
[01:11:58.100 --> 01:12:03.700]   Just as, excuse me, just like people who are in the brewery in the alcohol industry are
[01:12:03.700 --> 01:12:08.220]   stop making liquor, they're stop making beer and they're making alcohol and making hand
[01:12:08.220 --> 01:12:10.900]   sanitizer to send to other companies.
[01:12:10.900 --> 01:12:17.300]   There are factories that don't have any experience in building healthcare devices, but they
[01:12:17.300 --> 01:12:20.040]   have experience in creating a work force.
[01:12:20.040 --> 01:12:21.340]   They have a huge workforce.
[01:12:21.340 --> 01:12:23.200]   They have manufacturing capability.
[01:12:23.200 --> 01:12:30.020]   And so they want to switch from making Billy Bass talking fish to making an important
[01:12:30.020 --> 01:12:33.500]   valve for a respirator that's needed or even respirator bags.
[01:12:33.500 --> 01:12:40.860]   So I'm willing to give, until I'm willing to be a little bit open to, excuse me, a lot
[01:12:40.860 --> 01:12:44.100]   open to simply saying they're in this kind of crisis.
[01:12:44.100 --> 01:12:47.180]   Everybody wants to do something.
[01:12:47.180 --> 01:12:50.780]   And if you can do something that's actually positive all the better, but there is that
[01:12:50.780 --> 01:12:57.420]   impulse in everybody that I myself was thinking, gosh, there's like an animal shelter just
[01:12:57.420 --> 01:12:58.580]   like a few miles up the road.
[01:12:58.580 --> 01:12:59.580]   Are they having problems?
[01:12:59.580 --> 01:13:02.420]   Should I like foster like three cats and two dogs?
[01:13:02.420 --> 01:13:05.540]   Because I got room here and I'm going to be here all day.
[01:13:05.540 --> 01:13:10.300]   You want, I've seen so many cute cat photos from so many people who were stuck at home
[01:13:10.300 --> 01:13:15.420]   with their cats all day that now I'm like, I'm saying that if I see a cat on the street,
[01:13:15.420 --> 01:13:16.980]   I'm going to assume it's a stray.
[01:13:16.980 --> 01:13:18.140]   I'm going to cut off.
[01:13:18.140 --> 01:13:19.140]   It's a cut off.
[01:13:19.140 --> 01:13:22.820]   It's it's collar, not bother chipping it and I'm going to rescue it.
[01:13:22.820 --> 01:13:29.180]   But I'm going to say, I don't think that it's as altruistic as that and Leo and everybody.
[01:13:29.180 --> 01:13:36.300]   I think it's a it's a corporation and it wants to look good because it wants to give us the
[01:13:36.300 --> 01:13:41.100]   impression that it's good and we and we'll buy stuff from this company.
[01:13:41.100 --> 01:13:43.980]   There's not a human behind there saying we should be doing better.
[01:13:43.980 --> 01:13:48.260]   There are humans that work at Apple that are saying that, but I think this kind of thing
[01:13:48.260 --> 01:13:54.980]   it's really all about looking good so that we like them more and I'm in the COVID-19
[01:13:54.980 --> 01:13:58.100]   app, Apple's COVID-19 screening tool app.
[01:13:58.100 --> 01:14:02.180]   And one of the things that they offer in here is updates from Apple news.
[01:14:02.180 --> 01:14:06.620]   So they're redirecting you to Apple news so that you can read articles that have been
[01:14:06.620 --> 01:14:10.460]   screened and vetted to make sure that it's got proper information.
[01:14:10.460 --> 01:14:11.460]   And guess what?
[01:14:11.460 --> 01:14:14.300]   You know there's going to be at least one article in there that you have to have a
[01:14:14.300 --> 01:14:16.500]   news plus subscription.
[01:14:16.500 --> 01:14:17.500]   People are going to be reading through.
[01:14:17.500 --> 01:14:20.700]   They're going to come across these news plus articles that they really want to read and
[01:14:20.700 --> 01:14:22.180]   not just going to go, you know what?
[01:14:22.180 --> 01:14:26.940]   I'm going to subscribe so that I have news plus and they just made some money off that.
[01:14:26.940 --> 01:14:32.060]   That's a pretty realistic, you know, I love Apple, but it's a corporation and it's
[01:14:32.060 --> 01:14:33.780]   in it for the dollar.
[01:14:33.780 --> 01:14:38.140]   And the dollar means you make more money when people like you and they think that they can
[01:14:38.140 --> 01:14:39.620]   trust you.
[01:14:39.620 --> 01:14:43.740]   And you know, here's evidence right in here that they've got a pathway to making getting
[01:14:43.740 --> 01:14:45.540]   a subscription out of you possibly.
[01:14:45.540 --> 01:14:49.100]   And it didn't cost them very much to make this app.
[01:14:49.100 --> 01:14:53.020]   Apple is able to do something Swift 5.2 is out.
[01:14:53.020 --> 01:14:56.700]   Xcode 11.4 figures, the programmers are completely productive.
[01:14:56.700 --> 01:14:59.860]   They're going, oh, finally, nobody to bother me.
[01:14:59.860 --> 01:15:03.700]   I don't have to wear headphones to work anymore.
[01:15:03.700 --> 01:15:05.100]   Let's see.
[01:15:05.100 --> 01:15:10.340]   Apple is unsurprisingly, according to Apple Insider, a 2020 iPad Pro will bend if you
[01:15:10.340 --> 01:15:11.900]   try to bend it.
[01:15:11.900 --> 01:15:15.100]   Glad somebody's doing that.
[01:15:15.100 --> 01:15:18.500]   People, plastic cracks, glass breaks, metal bands.
[01:15:18.500 --> 01:15:21.140]   People who are spending some of your science is a wonderful thing.
[01:15:21.140 --> 01:15:22.140]   Apple is offering.
[01:15:22.140 --> 01:15:23.940]   There's some other stuff Apple's doing, which I think is great.
[01:15:23.940 --> 01:15:28.340]   They're giving free online learning consultations to US teachers.
[01:15:28.340 --> 01:15:30.620]   You have this in imore.com.
[01:15:30.620 --> 01:15:32.060]   I think that's cool.
[01:15:32.060 --> 01:15:37.500]   You can schedule free one-on-one coaching if you're a teacher in the US.
[01:15:37.500 --> 01:15:38.580]   The stores are closed.
[01:15:38.580 --> 01:15:42.020]   They're not doing those great events at the store.
[01:15:42.020 --> 01:15:46.220]   So they've got some geniuses who could probably help out.
[01:15:46.220 --> 01:15:53.700]   Educators can contact Apple Professional Learning via phone or email and ask for a virtual coaching
[01:15:53.700 --> 01:15:54.700]   session.
[01:15:54.700 --> 01:15:56.340]   That's something that's really much needed.
[01:15:56.340 --> 01:16:00.100]   You're throwing a lot of people to the lion saying, "Hey, just download Zoom.
[01:16:00.100 --> 01:16:01.100]   You're all set."
[01:16:01.100 --> 01:16:04.100]   It's not as easy as that.
[01:16:04.100 --> 01:16:09.420]   And opportunities for Google released a launch site last week.
[01:16:09.420 --> 01:16:13.300]   That is here's how to use all of our Google conferencing tools and collaboration tools.
[01:16:13.300 --> 01:16:14.300]   And collaboration tools.
[01:16:14.300 --> 01:16:16.140]   If you have to tour the downloads.
[01:16:16.140 --> 01:16:17.140]   Yeah.
[01:16:17.140 --> 01:16:18.140]   Yeah.
[01:16:18.140 --> 01:16:21.340]   So it's both a good thing for the company.
[01:16:21.340 --> 01:16:22.540]   Lori, you're right.
[01:16:22.540 --> 01:16:25.820]   There's some cynical reasons for doing this.
[01:16:25.820 --> 01:16:31.580]   But I think it's also an opportunity for them to step up.
[01:16:31.580 --> 01:16:33.780]   Apple is going to pay contractors.
[01:16:33.780 --> 01:16:36.500]   This is a problem for gig workers in general.
[01:16:36.500 --> 01:16:41.100]   Now Apple has, if Apple didn't, it would be shameful because Apple's got the deep pockets
[01:16:41.100 --> 01:16:42.100]   to do it.
[01:16:42.100 --> 01:16:43.100]   There are plenty of...
[01:16:43.100 --> 01:16:44.100]   It would be Amazon level shameful.
[01:16:44.100 --> 01:16:45.100]   Yeah.
[01:16:45.100 --> 01:16:46.100]   Yeah.
[01:16:46.100 --> 01:16:47.100]   Sure.
[01:16:47.100 --> 01:16:50.380]   There are plenty of small businesses who would love to, I'm sure, but can't.
[01:16:50.380 --> 01:16:54.900]   Lots of pretty much every restaurant you've ever been to is hanging by the skin and their
[01:16:54.900 --> 01:16:59.140]   teeth anyway in a normal situation.
[01:16:59.140 --> 01:17:00.140]   So that's good.
[01:17:00.140 --> 01:17:02.780]   I'm glad Apple's doing that.
[01:17:02.780 --> 01:17:07.420]   They have asked their store workers to take on tech support roles.
[01:17:07.420 --> 01:17:08.420]   Remember the stores?
[01:17:08.420 --> 01:17:09.420]   How...
[01:17:09.420 --> 01:17:10.420]   Now they said...
[01:17:10.420 --> 01:17:15.740]   What was the laughably short deadline that they were going to turn the stores back on?
[01:17:15.740 --> 01:17:17.860]   It was like in a week from now, something like that.
[01:17:17.860 --> 01:17:19.700]   April 7th, I think, maybe.
[01:17:19.700 --> 01:17:20.700]   Yeah.
[01:17:20.700 --> 01:17:21.700]   Yeah.
[01:17:21.700 --> 01:17:22.700]   It's mid-eight.
[01:17:22.700 --> 01:17:23.700]   I get a little more time.
[01:17:23.700 --> 01:17:26.980]   Time at home.
[01:17:26.980 --> 01:17:31.660]   So Apple's asking all retail store employees to temporarily become remote technical support
[01:17:31.660 --> 01:17:32.660]   staff.
[01:17:32.660 --> 01:17:37.380]   So you're still working, erking some workers who thought they'd be paid for simply staying
[01:17:37.380 --> 01:17:38.380]   at home.
[01:17:38.380 --> 01:17:41.300]   It says Mark German.
[01:17:41.300 --> 01:17:46.380]   The subset of retail staff are participating in the program to become work-from-home Apple
[01:17:46.380 --> 01:17:47.940]   Care employees.
[01:17:47.940 --> 01:17:52.580]   And that's just so the company has enough workers to handle customer requests.
[01:17:52.580 --> 01:17:56.820]   Some Apple retail employees told German that they felt their managers were prodding them
[01:17:56.820 --> 01:17:59.820]   to take part.
[01:17:59.820 --> 01:18:00.820]   You're working.
[01:18:00.820 --> 01:18:01.820]   You're getting paid.
[01:18:01.820 --> 01:18:05.340]   I think it's okay for your manager to assign something to you.
[01:18:05.340 --> 01:18:08.180]   That's why, like, again, I think a lot of these stories originated with complaints and that's
[01:18:08.180 --> 01:18:10.980]   the story you're going to get from people who are unhappy about having to do something.
[01:18:10.980 --> 01:18:11.980]   Right.
[01:18:11.980 --> 01:18:14.540]   It's the same thing, isn't it?
[01:18:14.540 --> 01:18:19.700]   So I will move along from that one.
[01:18:19.700 --> 01:18:28.420]   What about Google not putting Stadia on iOS, XCloud not putting Stadia on iOS, Nvidia's
[01:18:28.420 --> 01:18:29.980]   GeForce?
[01:18:29.980 --> 01:18:30.980]   It's an Apple thing.
[01:18:30.980 --> 01:18:35.220]   It's like Apple has all these guidelines that are like historic Steve Jobs and guidelines
[01:18:35.220 --> 01:18:36.220]   where...
[01:18:36.220 --> 01:18:37.220]   They won't like you stream games, for instance.
[01:18:37.220 --> 01:18:40.220]   Well, so it happened to not let you stream games.
[01:18:40.220 --> 01:18:43.820]   But like a lot of these were originally Apple being very Apple and controlling and also
[01:18:43.820 --> 01:18:46.220]   being very protectionist of their customers.
[01:18:46.220 --> 01:18:50.300]   And they just imagined anything that could go wrong or ways that could be exploited and
[01:18:50.300 --> 01:18:54.020]   they just made a bunch of rules that at the time made sense to them.
[01:18:54.020 --> 01:18:57.140]   When they architected the App Store, they didn't think about, "Oh, one day we'll just
[01:18:57.140 --> 01:18:58.140]   be beaming games."
[01:18:58.140 --> 01:18:59.740]   No, they weren't thinking of gaming services.
[01:18:59.740 --> 01:19:03.180]   In fact, I bet you what they were thinking of is we don't want anybody streaming windows
[01:19:03.180 --> 01:19:07.020]   to our iPad or porn or whatever.
[01:19:07.020 --> 01:19:08.020]   But they just not...
[01:19:08.020 --> 01:19:10.300]   So they changed the rule, you think?
[01:19:10.300 --> 01:19:13.220]   I think they're going to have to because it was almost like...
[01:19:13.220 --> 01:19:16.900]   Remember, Steam had to go back and forth about whether they'd allow Steam to work with...
[01:19:16.900 --> 01:19:18.220]   And it was like, "You could do this, but not that."
[01:19:18.220 --> 01:19:19.220]   And it's just...
[01:19:19.220 --> 01:19:23.020]   It looks like any competitive because they've got arcade and it looks like they're being
[01:19:23.020 --> 01:19:24.420]   chirlish.
[01:19:24.420 --> 01:19:25.820]   But I agree with you.
[01:19:25.820 --> 01:19:27.220]   It's more historic.
[01:19:27.220 --> 01:19:29.340]   But the question is, would I change it?
[01:19:29.340 --> 01:19:30.340]   And how fast?
[01:19:30.340 --> 01:19:33.100]   Because sometimes they're like, "Oh, we have a bunch of announcements to do.
[01:19:33.100 --> 01:19:34.100]   We'll fold it in."
[01:19:34.100 --> 01:19:37.660]   Meanwhile, they get just slaughtered for the next two months over it where they could
[01:19:37.660 --> 01:19:40.260]   think about it and enact it much.
[01:19:40.260 --> 01:19:41.260]   But they also...
[01:19:41.260 --> 01:19:42.740]   There's culturally...
[01:19:42.740 --> 01:19:44.780]   They measure it like 20 times and then speak.
[01:19:44.780 --> 01:19:47.980]   It's not like they have a big public debate about what they should do and you actually
[01:19:47.980 --> 01:19:50.140]   see they're working on it and trying things.
[01:19:50.140 --> 01:19:51.780]   It's just, "Nope, they're being silent.
[01:19:51.780 --> 01:19:52.780]   We're getting angrier.
[01:19:52.780 --> 01:19:53.780]   Why won't they say anything?
[01:19:53.780 --> 01:19:54.780]   We're getting angrier."
[01:19:54.780 --> 01:19:56.780]   And then too much they're like, "Okay, here's what we're doing."
[01:19:56.780 --> 01:19:57.780]   Just like, "Oh."
[01:19:57.780 --> 01:20:04.180]   It's a big deal if you're a Stadia or a game on Stadia or XCloud or GeForce because now
[01:20:04.180 --> 01:20:05.580]   because you...
[01:20:05.580 --> 01:20:07.820]   That's like the mobile platform.
[01:20:07.820 --> 01:20:09.940]   If you can't be on iOS.
[01:20:09.940 --> 01:20:13.540]   One of the big pitches for these is you can play it on your Android device.
[01:20:13.540 --> 01:20:19.420]   You get a little weird little controller with a Miesel on it, put your Android device
[01:20:19.420 --> 01:20:21.380]   on there and walk around playing games.
[01:20:21.380 --> 01:20:26.100]   But I wonder at some point, because the App Store is 12 years old, a lot of the things
[01:20:26.100 --> 01:20:29.540]   that it was set up to do are just not the same anymore.
[01:20:29.540 --> 01:20:33.740]   At a certain point if Apple says, "We're going to loosen the ties.
[01:20:33.740 --> 01:20:35.820]   You can buy your comics,ology comics.
[01:20:35.820 --> 01:20:37.420]   You can stream your games.
[01:20:37.420 --> 01:20:42.780]   But we're charging a minimum service fee for every app, including free apps because we're
[01:20:42.780 --> 01:20:43.780]   no longer...
[01:20:43.780 --> 01:20:45.820]   If everyone's going to do an end run, especially those...
[01:20:45.820 --> 01:20:50.180]   Because like Candy Crush and Pokemon Go, they would love to not give Apple a percentage.
[01:20:50.180 --> 01:20:52.140]   That's where most of the revenue of the App Store comes from.
[01:20:52.140 --> 01:20:53.780]   It's these games and their whales.
[01:20:53.780 --> 01:20:55.500]   If they could do an end run, they would.
[01:20:55.500 --> 01:20:59.060]   But then everything that's subsidizing everything else goes away and maybe it becomes a better
[01:20:59.060 --> 01:21:02.580]   market and gets rid of a lot of really crappy apps because everybody has to pay a little
[01:21:02.580 --> 01:21:07.260]   something regardless of what your price is to be on the App Store.
[01:21:07.260 --> 01:21:09.820]   It makes the service fee.
[01:21:09.820 --> 01:21:10.820]   It's in there.
[01:21:10.820 --> 01:21:13.340]   I don't think they're protecting arcade.
[01:21:13.340 --> 01:21:16.340]   It's in their interest to have these apps available.
[01:21:16.340 --> 01:21:20.540]   It makes the iPhone more desirable, makes it less desirable not to have them.
[01:21:20.540 --> 01:21:21.540]   Yes.
[01:21:21.540 --> 01:21:23.700]   It hurts them illegally.
[01:21:23.700 --> 01:21:26.700]   Like you said, even if they're not doing it just like competitive reasons, it looks like
[01:21:26.700 --> 01:21:29.140]   they're doing it for a better difference.
[01:21:29.140 --> 01:21:35.340]   There is a bug in iOS that affects you if you're using a VPN you should be aware about.
[01:21:35.340 --> 01:21:41.020]   If you have a network connection open and then start the VPN, the VPN won't automatically
[01:21:41.020 --> 01:21:45.060]   protect those existing connections, only new connections.
[01:21:45.060 --> 01:21:51.020]   Until the old connection times out and reconnects, you're going to be operating in a hybrid mode
[01:21:51.020 --> 01:21:54.540]   where some stuff will be encrypted in the VPN and some stuff won't.
[01:21:54.540 --> 01:21:57.500]   I'm sure Apple will fix that.
[01:21:57.500 --> 01:21:59.980]   It's just something to be aware of if you're using a VPN.
[01:21:59.980 --> 01:22:02.740]   The best thing to do would be shut down everything.
[01:22:02.740 --> 01:22:08.300]   Turn on the VPN and then reopen all your connections.
[01:22:08.300 --> 01:22:10.580]   That's a simple bug easy.
[01:22:10.580 --> 01:22:17.660]   You could see how it would happen and it's something they could fix.
[01:22:17.660 --> 01:22:23.020]   Apple is if you're watching stuff at home and who isn't and if you've already watched
[01:22:23.020 --> 01:22:25.140]   all of Tiger King and who hasn't.
[01:22:25.140 --> 01:22:28.580]   Have you guys seen this show yet?
[01:22:28.580 --> 01:22:32.700]   I haven't gotten through the entire show but I watched five episodes.
[01:22:32.700 --> 01:22:35.580]   I made the mistake of watching the first episode.
[01:22:35.580 --> 01:22:38.740]   I hadn't heard of it and I didn't know what it was.
[01:22:38.740 --> 01:22:44.020]   I allowed the virus into my home at midnight and then at the end of every episode I'm like,
[01:22:44.020 --> 01:22:45.020]   "Wait, wait, wait."
[01:22:45.020 --> 01:22:49.340]   And then it's 8am and I'm like, "Okay, I guess I'm just not going to sleep tonight."
[01:22:49.340 --> 01:22:52.820]   It's a very well done documentary.
[01:22:52.820 --> 01:22:56.300]   The weirdest story ever.
[01:22:56.300 --> 01:23:01.140]   But once you've finished that, Apple is offering a 4K movie sale, the biggest sale
[01:23:01.140 --> 01:23:08.420]   of the year according to 9-5 toys, Parasite Academy Award winning best picture $10.00,
[01:23:08.420 --> 01:23:09.420]   half off.
[01:23:09.420 --> 01:23:11.660]   Uncut gems which I highly recommend.
[01:23:11.660 --> 01:23:14.380]   I already bought both of these.
[01:23:14.380 --> 01:23:17.620]   I shouldn't even say Adam Sandler because it's good.
[01:23:17.620 --> 01:23:19.860]   It's $10.
[01:23:19.860 --> 01:23:21.100]   It's on Netflix Canada for some reason.
[01:23:21.100 --> 01:23:22.100]   I know.
[01:23:22.100 --> 01:23:23.100]   I know.
[01:23:23.100 --> 01:23:24.100]   Isn't that funny?
[01:23:24.100 --> 01:23:25.100]   Netflix Canada.
[01:23:25.100 --> 01:23:26.100]   Yeah.
[01:23:26.100 --> 01:23:28.100]   Free healthcare and uncut gems.
[01:23:28.100 --> 01:23:30.380]   What was 10?
[01:23:30.380 --> 01:23:33.220]   Word versus Ferrari $13.00.
[01:23:33.220 --> 01:23:34.220]   That's a pretty good movie.
[01:23:34.220 --> 01:23:35.220]   I liked that.
[01:23:35.220 --> 01:23:38.540]   Although people who are race car experts, people like Samable Smith say, "Well, it's
[01:23:38.540 --> 01:23:40.540]   not very accurate."
[01:23:40.540 --> 01:23:44.260]   But you know, I watched one of those cop movies with a friend of mine who's a mechanic and
[01:23:44.260 --> 01:23:46.820]   he's like, "The car can't go over the street like that in land.
[01:23:46.820 --> 01:23:47.820]   It would just break."
[01:23:47.820 --> 01:23:50.580]   And you'll see him like you're watching an airplane movie with a pilot.
[01:23:50.580 --> 01:23:51.580]   The plane can't bank that.
[01:23:51.580 --> 01:23:53.660]   So you've got to suspend.
[01:23:53.660 --> 01:23:58.500]   Every time they do a movie about podcasting, I just watch all the mistakes.
[01:23:58.500 --> 01:23:59.500]   Or TV shows.
[01:23:59.500 --> 01:24:02.540]   The TV shows now you sign up podcasting dealers like becoming JK Rowling.
[01:24:02.540 --> 01:24:05.100]   It's like, "Oh, you podcast got picked up.
[01:24:05.100 --> 01:24:06.100]   You're rich."
[01:24:06.100 --> 01:24:07.100]   You're rich.
[01:24:07.100 --> 01:24:10.740]   So anyway, a lot of movies you might want to...
[01:24:10.740 --> 01:24:11.740]   I mean, this is nice.
[01:24:11.740 --> 01:24:12.740]   Thank you, Apple.
[01:24:12.740 --> 01:24:18.380]   You might want to check and see what the prices are because they're doing a lot of stuff.
[01:24:18.380 --> 01:24:20.300]   Now, you mentioned Prosser.
[01:24:20.300 --> 01:24:24.500]   So he's a reliable source.
[01:24:24.500 --> 01:24:28.340]   He's currently been doing a lot of stories that have proven to be correct.
[01:24:28.340 --> 01:24:30.820]   So he claims he has very good source inside of Apple.
[01:24:30.820 --> 01:24:31.820]   I have no reason to doubt him.
[01:24:31.820 --> 01:24:34.300]   And they've been proving...
[01:24:34.300 --> 01:24:38.420]   I think there was one that he said he got wrong, but out of a half dozen or so over the last
[01:24:38.420 --> 01:24:39.420]   month.
[01:24:39.420 --> 01:24:40.420]   You get the senses.
[01:24:40.420 --> 01:24:41.420]   He's got tipsters, right?
[01:24:41.420 --> 01:24:42.900]   Telling him what's going on.
[01:24:42.900 --> 01:24:48.380]   He's got some pretty specific information when he has these rumors that he comes out with.
[01:24:48.380 --> 01:24:51.420]   It's not just six months from now.
[01:24:51.420 --> 01:24:52.420]   Something might happen.
[01:24:52.420 --> 01:24:53.420]   It's very specific.
[01:24:53.420 --> 01:24:58.300]   I think the recent one that he just said was that the new iPhone is going to be under
[01:24:58.300 --> 01:24:59.300]   announced on...
[01:24:59.300 --> 01:25:02.740]   Was it announced on April 15th and comes out on the 21st?
[01:25:02.740 --> 01:25:04.620]   He has very specific dates.
[01:25:04.620 --> 01:25:08.140]   So it seems a little one-on-one.
[01:25:08.140 --> 01:25:12.020]   I'm talking with somebody very specifically who has this information.
[01:25:12.020 --> 01:25:13.020]   Yeah.
[01:25:13.020 --> 01:25:17.740]   The tweet which came out a few days ago, Apple briefing happening right now.
[01:25:17.740 --> 01:25:23.340]   Like, he's got somebody texting him at the briefing.
[01:25:23.340 --> 01:25:27.180]   As I mentioned before, logistically, iPhone 9 will be ready to ship in April due to economic
[01:25:27.180 --> 01:25:29.180]   pressures and shareholder obligations.
[01:25:29.180 --> 01:25:31.740]   Apple is considering releasing the iPhone 9 in April.
[01:25:31.740 --> 01:25:33.500]   I'll keep you updated.
[01:25:33.500 --> 01:25:39.100]   And then six rolls of toilet paper, you know, because he can afford that.
[01:25:39.100 --> 01:25:44.020]   Now, I saw this and I thought, "Well, I don't know John Prosser.
[01:25:44.020 --> 01:25:45.020]   Who is this guy?
[01:25:45.020 --> 01:25:46.020]   Is he a reliable?"
[01:25:46.020 --> 01:25:49.060]   He runs the YouTube channel from Page Tech and he's one who got all the Google Pixel
[01:25:49.060 --> 01:25:50.060]   leaks last year.
[01:25:50.060 --> 01:25:51.260]   Oh, all right.
[01:25:51.260 --> 01:25:53.300]   So he's got a track record.
[01:25:53.300 --> 01:25:54.300]   Yeah.
[01:25:54.300 --> 01:25:55.300]   Yeah.
[01:25:55.300 --> 01:25:56.300]   Let's see.
[01:25:56.300 --> 01:25:58.300]   I'm looking at other...
[01:25:58.300 --> 01:26:04.900]   Rumors, I always kind of look a scance at, but we don't have much other news.
[01:26:04.900 --> 01:26:08.540]   Apple developing Touch ID for Apple Watch.
[01:26:08.540 --> 01:26:14.740]   Well, so, I mean, I prefer the pulse to Touch ID because it's like passive authentication.
[01:26:14.740 --> 01:26:16.140]   I never have to actually touch it.
[01:26:16.140 --> 01:26:19.380]   So that to me feels like a regression unless there's something super special that goes
[01:26:19.380 --> 01:26:20.380]   with it.
[01:26:20.380 --> 01:26:23.260]   There is a reason, Renee, why this could be beneficial.
[01:26:23.260 --> 01:26:27.140]   It's for people who don't like to wear their watch tight against their wrist.
[01:26:27.140 --> 01:26:28.940]   It drives me nuts.
[01:26:28.940 --> 01:26:33.620]   I have a friend who won't buy an Apple Watch because she wears a looser wrist, you know,
[01:26:33.620 --> 01:26:36.420]   like a wristlet kind of thing or like a bangle kind of thing.
[01:26:36.420 --> 01:26:42.300]   So this could potentially open up the market for people who don't need to have their pulse
[01:26:42.300 --> 01:26:47.260]   checked all day long, but they want the other benefits that come along with an Apple Watch
[01:26:47.260 --> 01:26:51.900]   so they can wear a looser band and enjoy it and, you know, get notifications and everything.
[01:26:51.900 --> 01:26:56.860]   Like a pocket watch or a pocket watch and just be able to touch ID.
[01:26:56.860 --> 01:26:57.860]   Yeah.
[01:26:57.860 --> 01:27:00.980]   I could see this potentially being a good thing.
[01:27:00.980 --> 01:27:01.980]   Yeah.
[01:27:01.980 --> 01:27:06.740]   It could also be a step towards, I think, the true, the inevitable destiny of the Apple Watch
[01:27:06.740 --> 01:27:12.180]   was to make it an independent device that does not require an iPhone or any other device
[01:27:12.180 --> 01:27:13.180]   ever.
[01:27:13.180 --> 01:27:14.820]   Apple, now we got done.
[01:27:14.820 --> 01:27:19.060]   It's one thing for Apple to not support Android on a weather app.
[01:27:19.060 --> 01:27:23.620]   I mean, that's even I'm saying it would be nice, but I don't really expect them to do
[01:27:23.620 --> 01:27:24.620]   that.
[01:27:24.620 --> 01:27:30.260]   But how much money are they leaving on the table given the given the absolute failure
[01:27:30.260 --> 01:27:37.020]   of Google to make any traction with with Wear OS and given how fragmented all other device
[01:27:37.020 --> 01:27:44.660]   fitness manufacturers are, if they had a device that did not need that did not need a phone
[01:27:44.660 --> 01:27:51.540]   in order to work and maybe at at worse just had a here's a desktop app that here's a either
[01:27:51.540 --> 01:27:56.220]   a website you can you can hook it up to or a simple little turnkey app for the for your
[01:27:56.220 --> 01:28:00.980]   phone that does nothing but you know, changes a master settings or gets you into factory
[01:28:00.980 --> 01:28:02.940]   mode if it gets screwed up.
[01:28:02.940 --> 01:28:05.140]   How much more money would they make?
[01:28:05.140 --> 01:28:06.780]   They're already making it hand over fist.
[01:28:06.780 --> 01:28:10.660]   They would need more fists with which to put hands over the money.
[01:28:10.660 --> 01:28:12.860]   I really think that there was.
[01:28:12.860 --> 01:28:18.980]   And also we're talking about the companies that feel as though they have a sort of an
[01:28:18.980 --> 01:28:21.380]   obligation to humanity to do certain things.
[01:28:21.380 --> 01:28:24.820]   If Apple keeps hitting this point over and over again, but here's all the lives that
[01:28:24.820 --> 01:28:28.660]   we're saving, not just lives that we're changing with with the Apple Watch.
[01:28:28.660 --> 01:28:29.660]   Here's the lives that we're changing.
[01:28:29.660 --> 01:28:34.900]   And now we're going to have an O2 sensor that they even makes even makes it even more even
[01:28:34.900 --> 01:28:38.620]   more capable not only for fitness, but also as a health device.
[01:28:38.620 --> 01:28:43.980]   What is their excuse for not putting out a simple Android app saying we don't we only
[01:28:43.980 --> 01:28:48.180]   want Apple users to live if they have a fib.
[01:28:48.180 --> 01:28:50.780]   So this is what for so many reasons.
[01:28:50.780 --> 01:28:55.980]   I think that it's inevitable for Apple to produce a standalone watch.
[01:28:55.980 --> 01:28:56.980]   I don't know.
[01:28:56.980 --> 01:29:02.340]   Especially when it's such a it's in my opinion, the Apple watches the the the life saving device
[01:29:02.340 --> 01:29:10.860]   of the decade of the century, maybe because of its ability to detect falls to let you
[01:29:10.860 --> 01:29:16.260]   call 911 if you're in very in an unsecure place without having to actually talk to anybody.
[01:29:16.260 --> 01:29:22.420]   The A-Fib detector, all of this stuff is it's a lifesaver and we've read dozens and dozens
[01:29:22.420 --> 01:29:28.900]   of articles of it literally being a lifesaver and to be platform agnostic or even not needing
[01:29:28.900 --> 01:29:34.140]   any platform but to be a standalone Apple watch so that your grandma who doesn't know
[01:29:34.140 --> 01:29:37.580]   how to use a phone could have just have it on a wrist.
[01:29:37.580 --> 01:29:42.180]   And you know that if something were to happen to her, you'd get an immediate response from
[01:29:42.180 --> 01:29:43.620]   some kind of emergency service.
[01:29:43.620 --> 01:29:50.700]   I think Apple could benefit the world by making Apple watch completely agnostic and not needing
[01:29:50.700 --> 01:29:54.580]   a phone of any kind to connect to it.
[01:29:54.580 --> 01:29:59.620]   A lot of goodwill coming out of that one.
[01:29:59.620 --> 01:30:06.140]   According to people looking now at the iOS beta 1345 because I guess that just came out,
[01:30:06.140 --> 01:30:08.620]   is that right just today?
[01:30:08.620 --> 01:30:19.020]   There is in the code an iPhone model that has touch ID as well as car key as well as
[01:30:19.020 --> 01:30:26.820]   a few other of the more modern features, express transit cards, power reserve.
[01:30:26.820 --> 01:30:32.500]   That sounds like that's 1345 is getting ready for an iPhone 9.
[01:30:32.500 --> 01:30:40.260]   So another bit of information leading to I think an April release.
[01:30:40.260 --> 01:30:42.260]   Not quite confirming but getting there.
[01:30:42.260 --> 01:30:48.860]   Well they can also change their minds like it's all up in flux.
[01:30:48.860 --> 01:30:52.860]   Is this a problem for Apple?
[01:30:52.860 --> 01:30:57.500]   I saw this Samsung is planning to end all LCD production by the end of the year.
[01:30:57.500 --> 01:31:01.460]   I don't know that these source LCD from Samsung.
[01:31:01.460 --> 01:31:02.460]   Oh, they do.
[01:31:02.460 --> 01:31:05.580]   But I think LCD and they just invested in Japan.
[01:31:05.580 --> 01:31:09.220]   Apparently, according to the rumors, they just give quite a bit of money to Japan display.
[01:31:09.220 --> 01:31:10.220]   Yeah.
[01:31:10.220 --> 01:31:14.060]   They're at least three or four different manufacturers of LCD.
[01:31:14.060 --> 01:31:15.060]   They're still in the business.
[01:31:15.060 --> 01:31:18.620]   That would be even if they had to tool up for Apple's business, they'd love to have it.
[01:31:18.620 --> 01:31:23.140]   So it's just an option of whether how long does Apple want to use LCD displays?
[01:31:23.140 --> 01:31:24.620]   This Apple and Sutter LCDs.
[01:31:24.620 --> 01:31:25.620]   Sorry.
[01:31:25.620 --> 01:31:28.620]   I don't see these displays.
[01:31:28.620 --> 01:31:33.540]   The Apple and Sutter story says Samsung has in the past supplied LCDs for the iPhone,
[01:31:33.540 --> 01:31:37.900]   iPad and Mac but demand has waned as Apple moves to OLED.
[01:31:37.900 --> 01:31:39.940]   But still there's no OLED on the iPad.
[01:31:39.940 --> 01:31:41.460]   There's no OLED on the MacBook.
[01:31:41.460 --> 01:31:43.900]   We're waiting on many LCD LCD.
[01:31:43.900 --> 01:31:44.900]   Right.
[01:31:44.900 --> 01:31:50.420]   So the Korean company fills a bulk of Apple's OLED orders for flagship iPhone models and
[01:31:50.420 --> 01:31:53.620]   Apple Watch with LG picking up the slack.
[01:31:53.620 --> 01:31:59.420]   BOE is reportedly set to enter Apple's supply chain in 2020 or 2021.
[01:31:59.420 --> 01:32:00.420]   So it doesn't sound like...
[01:32:00.420 --> 01:32:03.460]   BOE's suddenly discovered Samsung's process and began offering the inside.
[01:32:03.460 --> 01:32:04.460]   Probably.
[01:32:04.460 --> 01:32:05.460]   It's a tiny...
[01:32:05.460 --> 01:32:06.460]   They believe that's true.
[01:32:06.460 --> 01:32:07.460]   Yeah.
[01:32:07.460 --> 01:32:08.460]   I don't know.
[01:32:08.460 --> 01:32:09.460]   I can say it's a speculation that BOE has Samsung's process.
[01:32:09.460 --> 01:32:10.460]   We figured it out.
[01:32:10.460 --> 01:32:11.460]   Yeah.
[01:32:11.460 --> 01:32:12.460]   Yeah.
[01:32:12.460 --> 01:32:16.500]   And the reason why Samsung is shutting down LCD productions because they want to use that
[01:32:16.500 --> 01:32:21.580]   manufacturing capacity for more modern or next generation display technologies.
[01:32:21.580 --> 01:32:27.740]   So it's possible that if Samsung wants to deliver screens to Apple for any devices,
[01:32:27.740 --> 01:32:32.380]   they might be able to deliver something that is less expensive, more reliable and actually
[01:32:32.380 --> 01:32:34.020]   higher quality.
[01:32:34.020 --> 01:32:35.900]   Good news for Dropbox users, I guess.
[01:32:35.900 --> 01:32:39.820]   I mean, one of the features of iCloud that people liked was that your desktop and your
[01:32:39.820 --> 01:32:44.820]   documents folder would automatically be synced to iCloud.
[01:32:44.820 --> 01:32:46.060]   You couldn't do that with Dropbox.
[01:32:46.060 --> 01:32:48.460]   You had to have a Dropbox folder.
[01:32:48.460 --> 01:32:52.340]   Apparently, there's a beta out for Mac that can sync your desktop.
[01:32:52.340 --> 01:32:53.340]   Ooh-wee.
[01:32:53.340 --> 01:32:54.340]   Ooh-wee.
[01:32:54.340 --> 01:32:55.340]   I turned that.
[01:32:55.340 --> 01:32:56.340]   That's the first thing I turned off.
[01:32:56.340 --> 01:32:57.340]   That was so mad.
[01:32:57.340 --> 01:32:58.340]   Me too.
[01:32:58.340 --> 01:32:59.340]   That's why I still use Dropbox.
[01:32:59.340 --> 01:33:00.340]   Yeah.
[01:33:00.340 --> 01:33:02.780]   I was so mad that Apple turned that on by default.
[01:33:02.780 --> 01:33:03.780]   And I didn't even realize...
[01:33:03.780 --> 01:33:04.780]   Yeah, I ask you now.
[01:33:04.780 --> 01:33:05.780]   I think like the latest Macs have installed.
[01:33:05.780 --> 01:33:07.820]   They asked you when you sent them on.
[01:33:07.820 --> 01:33:10.460]   Like what my desktop is being synced?
[01:33:10.460 --> 01:33:13.740]   I don't want to sync my desktop.
[01:33:13.740 --> 01:33:14.740]   That's silly.
[01:33:14.740 --> 01:33:20.820]   Thank God, those 2,000 unlabeled screenshots from today, all the way back to 2003.
[01:33:20.820 --> 01:33:22.100]   You have to save those, baby.
[01:33:22.100 --> 01:33:23.100]   Or in the cloud.
[01:33:23.100 --> 01:33:25.020]   So I've been using desktop sync.
[01:33:25.020 --> 01:33:27.220]   I think I turned it on for...
[01:33:27.220 --> 01:33:32.220]   Or you know, I initially had it on for a how-to guide and just left it on.
[01:33:32.220 --> 01:33:33.220]   Yeah.
[01:33:33.220 --> 01:33:34.220]   You love it?
[01:33:34.220 --> 01:33:35.220]   I actually really like it.
[01:33:35.220 --> 01:33:37.620]   So I've used my desktop in a different way now.
[01:33:37.620 --> 01:33:38.620]   How do I keep...
[01:33:38.620 --> 01:33:41.660]   I value for you that all your Macs have the same desktop?
[01:33:41.660 --> 01:33:42.660]   Yeah.
[01:33:42.660 --> 01:33:48.660]   So for me, I keep certain documents that I know that I'm going to access multiple times
[01:33:48.660 --> 01:33:49.780]   per day every day.
[01:33:49.780 --> 01:33:51.780]   I just keep them on my desktop.
[01:33:51.780 --> 01:33:52.940]   And they're right there.
[01:33:52.940 --> 01:33:53.940]   I just click on them.
[01:33:53.940 --> 01:33:54.940]   I don't have to find them.
[01:33:54.940 --> 01:33:55.940]   I don't have to search from their just right there.
[01:33:55.940 --> 01:33:56.940]   And I click on them.
[01:33:56.940 --> 01:33:59.220]   So for me, that's the benefit of it.
[01:33:59.220 --> 01:34:05.380]   Is that whether I'm on my Mac or I'm on my MacBook Pro, they're just right there on my
[01:34:05.380 --> 01:34:06.380]   desktop for me.
[01:34:06.380 --> 01:34:07.780]   You know, on my phone, I don't care.
[01:34:07.780 --> 01:34:12.980]   I don't need them syncing on my phone because I very rarely would access a file that's on
[01:34:12.980 --> 01:34:14.260]   my desktop on my phone.
[01:34:14.260 --> 01:34:20.780]   But if I did need to do that, if I happened to be out and about or was just on my phone
[01:34:20.780 --> 01:34:25.820]   and I knew that I had a file on my desktop, I could just grab it really quickly.
[01:34:25.820 --> 01:34:27.540]   So I do actually like it.
[01:34:27.540 --> 01:34:29.420]   I find it to be very beneficial.
[01:34:29.420 --> 01:34:30.420]   You're right.
[01:34:30.420 --> 01:34:31.420]   It seems ridiculous.
[01:34:31.420 --> 01:34:34.900]   But once you get used to it, the thought of not having it.
[01:34:34.900 --> 01:34:35.900]   Yeah.
[01:34:35.900 --> 01:34:39.500]   The thought of not having it is a little bit like, well, you know, I have to go through
[01:34:39.500 --> 01:34:43.380]   nine different steps if I want to get it from from Dropbox, where as right now, it's like,
[01:34:43.380 --> 01:34:44.580]   it's just right there on my desktop.
[01:34:44.580 --> 01:34:45.580]   Okay.
[01:34:45.580 --> 01:34:46.580]   There you go.
[01:34:46.580 --> 01:34:49.700]   Dropbox apparently agrees, Lori Gill.
[01:34:49.700 --> 01:34:53.060]   Time for our picks of the week.
[01:34:53.060 --> 01:34:56.140]   Any mini mini Mo and I just talk about it.
[01:34:56.140 --> 01:35:01.340]   I think I'm going to start with Renee Richie because he's all about the new.
[01:35:01.340 --> 01:35:03.380]   Now, I know, I think Leo, I heard you.
[01:35:03.380 --> 01:35:05.780]   I was going to mention some of the Pokemon stuff, but I think I heard you talking about
[01:35:05.780 --> 01:35:06.780]   it with with Mike.
[01:35:06.780 --> 01:35:07.780]   Yes, Micah.
[01:35:07.780 --> 01:35:08.780]   I don't know.
[01:35:08.780 --> 01:35:10.020]   I guess he's becoming a Pokemon guy.
[01:35:10.020 --> 01:35:11.020]   Wow.
[01:35:11.020 --> 01:35:13.620]   They're doing a bunch of work from home stuff where you're going to be able to coordinate
[01:35:13.620 --> 01:35:17.860]   raids at home and do a whole bunch of other stuff to make it less about, ironically less
[01:35:17.860 --> 01:35:21.100]   about going out and walking and more about just communicating with your friends.
[01:35:21.100 --> 01:35:22.100]   Right.
[01:35:22.100 --> 01:35:23.100]   Yeah.
[01:35:23.100 --> 01:35:26.180]   So that's if you have haven't played in a while and you're super bored, take a look
[01:35:26.180 --> 01:35:27.180]   at what they're doing now.
[01:35:27.180 --> 01:35:29.620]   And a lot of the stuff you used to have to run around and do you can do at home.
[01:35:29.620 --> 01:35:31.700]   I'll tell you, if you haven't played in a while, this is a game.
[01:35:31.700 --> 01:35:33.220]   This game has really evolved.
[01:35:33.220 --> 01:35:35.900]   I really like the new Pokemon go.
[01:35:35.900 --> 01:35:39.460]   And of course, Lisa, Lisa never stopped playing.
[01:35:39.460 --> 01:35:42.300]   You get to walk with your little friend and adventure.
[01:35:42.300 --> 01:35:43.300]   If you present.
[01:35:43.300 --> 01:35:45.540]   Now we'll work in the house with exercise.
[01:35:45.540 --> 01:35:48.860]   This is a lot of reasons to take a look at it again.
[01:35:48.860 --> 01:35:49.860]   But that's not your thing.
[01:35:49.860 --> 01:35:50.860]   And maybe we can raid together in the interview.
[01:35:50.860 --> 01:35:53.780]   Oh, I could raid with you in your place and my place.
[01:35:53.780 --> 01:35:54.780]   That would be cool.
[01:35:54.780 --> 01:35:55.780]   Yeah.
[01:35:55.780 --> 01:35:56.780]   Our virtual universe.
[01:35:56.780 --> 01:36:00.100]   So my pick is because there are so many people who have to do meetings and everything
[01:36:00.100 --> 01:36:01.100]   at home.
[01:36:01.100 --> 01:36:03.420]   Maybe even their world famous talk shows at home.
[01:36:03.420 --> 01:36:07.620]   One of the things that I find very useful and I see used a lot are these tiny men photo
[01:36:07.620 --> 01:36:08.620]   tripods.
[01:36:08.620 --> 01:36:09.780]   You can get them in any places.
[01:36:09.780 --> 01:36:11.580]   Apple was selling them for a while.
[01:36:11.580 --> 01:36:13.900]   And all they are is just a tiny tripod.
[01:36:13.900 --> 01:36:17.500]   You can get them with a standard mount on them or you can get them with a little camera
[01:36:17.500 --> 01:36:21.940]   with a little phone holder and you can put any iPhone or Android phone into them or a
[01:36:21.940 --> 01:36:22.940]   microphone.
[01:36:22.940 --> 01:36:26.300]   So whatever you're doing, if you're doing a lot of web meetings and you're just not happy
[01:36:26.300 --> 01:36:30.580]   with the cameras that come on the Macs or you're worried like Zoom has got huge security
[01:36:30.580 --> 01:36:35.020]   and privacy issues that you can avoid many of if you use the iOS version instead of the
[01:36:35.020 --> 01:36:39.260]   Mac version because it's sandboxed and you just want to you want something to put your
[01:36:39.260 --> 01:36:43.260]   device on and hold it for you or to hold your better microphone.
[01:36:43.260 --> 01:36:45.860]   Manfroto's small tripods are just excellent.
[01:36:45.860 --> 01:36:50.660]   I have a couple of them especially when I was traveling, they were super useful for traveling.
[01:36:50.660 --> 01:36:53.700]   But now when I'm staying at home, like if I'm just sitting around on a table and I'm
[01:36:53.700 --> 01:36:58.420]   not using this big setup, I just put a microphone on that, put a phone on that, everything.
[01:36:58.420 --> 01:36:59.420]   And they just hold them up.
[01:36:59.420 --> 01:37:00.900]   You don't have to stack books.
[01:37:00.900 --> 01:37:03.100]   You don't have to like they don't fall off your bag.
[01:37:03.100 --> 01:37:05.740]   They just do that one job very, very well.
[01:37:05.740 --> 01:37:09.460]   They're the classic name in the tripods.
[01:37:09.460 --> 01:37:11.140]   But we always have the big men photos.
[01:37:11.140 --> 01:37:13.060]   I didn't know they made little itty bitty.
[01:37:13.060 --> 01:37:16.540]   Yeah, well you can get gorilla pods too, but sometimes those are harder to manage with
[01:37:16.540 --> 01:37:17.900]   the legs and they're really are worth.
[01:37:17.900 --> 01:37:21.420]   They just open it up, you put it down, you adjust it and you're good.
[01:37:21.420 --> 01:37:23.020]   That's a good price, 60 bucks.
[01:37:23.020 --> 01:37:24.020]   Canadian.
[01:37:24.020 --> 01:37:25.020]   Yeah.
[01:37:25.020 --> 01:37:26.020]   Yeah.
[01:37:26.020 --> 01:37:27.020]   I have no idea what that is in real money, but.
[01:37:27.020 --> 01:37:28.020]   Well, I think you said that the Canadian site?
[01:37:28.020 --> 01:37:29.020]   I can't tell.
[01:37:29.020 --> 01:37:31.420]   I'm sorry, I just based on the link.
[01:37:31.420 --> 01:37:32.420]   No, I don't mind.
[01:37:32.420 --> 01:37:33.420]   That's like four bucks US.
[01:37:33.420 --> 01:37:34.420]   That's gonna be.
[01:37:34.420 --> 01:37:37.900]   Let me go to the United States to see.
[01:37:37.900 --> 01:37:39.900]   Oh yeah, it is $36.99.
[01:37:39.900 --> 01:37:40.900]   You guys robbed.
[01:37:40.900 --> 01:37:41.900]   Yep.
[01:37:41.900 --> 01:37:42.900]   You get robbed.
[01:37:42.900 --> 01:37:47.340]   It's not good right now, but the price of gas is if I could drive somewhere, the gas
[01:37:47.340 --> 01:37:48.900]   have been probably going to be good.
[01:37:48.900 --> 01:37:49.900]   Oh, that's good.
[01:37:49.900 --> 01:37:53.740]   Manthroat, design in Italy, $36.99 in the US.
[01:37:53.740 --> 01:37:54.740]   Belly Simo.
[01:37:54.740 --> 01:37:56.260]   Belly Simo.
[01:37:56.260 --> 01:37:57.340]   And I cannot go.
[01:37:57.340 --> 01:37:58.900]   You're pick of the week.
[01:37:58.900 --> 01:38:02.180]   I've got two good reasons to make my pick of the week.
[01:38:02.180 --> 01:38:06.580]   Charlie Monroe's downy streaming video downloader.
[01:38:06.580 --> 01:38:10.900]   Number one, he's updated it to version four and added a whole bunch of really cool features.
[01:38:10.900 --> 01:38:13.620]   It's a very pretty new redesign.
[01:38:13.620 --> 01:38:15.620]   These new, there's now a menu bar control.
[01:38:15.620 --> 01:38:20.180]   So when you're downloading stuff from YouTube, downloading stuff from Instagram, Facebook,
[01:38:20.180 --> 01:38:23.900]   whatever site you want, you can you can see how things are going and activate things from
[01:38:23.900 --> 01:38:24.900]   the menu bar.
[01:38:24.900 --> 01:38:28.740]   You can have more control over how it post processes things.
[01:38:28.740 --> 01:38:33.140]   So that I download things to put them on my media server, but I was used to have to do
[01:38:33.140 --> 01:38:36.380]   a whole bunch of extra steps to make sure it's named correctly and it's in the right
[01:38:36.380 --> 01:38:40.620]   format and I just simply set it all up and then he didn't need it.
[01:38:40.620 --> 01:38:46.300]   And it's only 20 bucks and it's really ever since I've been users since early 3.0, actually
[01:38:46.300 --> 01:38:47.740]   maybe 2.0.
[01:38:47.740 --> 01:38:50.740]   And it's an app that I use all the time and I'll tell you why.
[01:38:50.740 --> 01:38:58.820]   I really, really miss in the digital age, not having a VCR hooked up to like regular cable
[01:38:58.820 --> 01:39:03.900]   TV because sometimes their TV shows are like just you're taping Letterman and sometimes
[01:39:03.900 --> 01:39:06.660]   the show was so good that you actually want to keep it.
[01:39:06.660 --> 01:39:12.980]   There's actually a guy as Nickname is Don Z who has every single episode that Letterman
[01:39:12.980 --> 01:39:14.220]   ever did.
[01:39:14.220 --> 01:39:18.940]   He is actually the art the archiver of the show based on his videotapes and his recordings
[01:39:18.940 --> 01:39:20.740]   and his archiving.
[01:39:20.740 --> 01:39:25.260]   When worldwide pants that produces themselves get a request for, hey, we need a copy of
[01:39:25.260 --> 01:39:28.140]   this show from this guest from this show from this year.
[01:39:28.140 --> 01:39:29.140]   They don't do it themselves.
[01:39:29.140 --> 01:39:30.460]   They say, oh, talk to this guy, Don Z.
[01:39:30.460 --> 01:39:33.460]   He has a copy of it and he'll kind of deal for you.
[01:39:33.460 --> 01:39:37.700]   But what I've missed is that if there's something that you just seen, you can't just
[01:39:37.700 --> 01:39:40.780]   keep it and have it in your library for keeps or keeps or keeps.
[01:39:40.780 --> 01:39:44.780]   And getting to the second reason why beyond the upgrade, why this is a good recommendation,
[01:39:44.780 --> 01:39:47.900]   we're seeing so much unusual television now.
[01:39:47.900 --> 01:39:49.420]   We're seeing again, the cool bear.
[01:39:49.420 --> 01:39:55.780]   We're seeing the late night shows being done in the host's living rooms with off the shelf
[01:39:55.780 --> 01:39:59.940]   streaming technology with no laugh track and just making it up as they go.
[01:39:59.940 --> 01:40:04.100]   Don't you want to be able to watch that five years from now when you've forgotten all about
[01:40:04.100 --> 01:40:08.700]   how much trouble that this pandemic was causing for everybody in the cost.
[01:40:08.700 --> 01:40:15.940]   And also there's so many different arts organizations that are streaming their content for free
[01:40:15.940 --> 01:40:19.580]   to sort of help people to stay at home and be entertained.
[01:40:19.580 --> 01:40:26.300]   The Royal National National, the Royal National National National Theatre of London.
[01:40:26.300 --> 01:40:32.660]   They're rerunning the show that James Corden, the comedy stage play that James Corden kind
[01:40:32.660 --> 01:40:36.260]   of relaunched his career after he had his first big success.
[01:40:36.260 --> 01:40:41.820]   And then according to the E Hollywood story, he and then he let it all slip away.
[01:40:41.820 --> 01:40:44.500]   And I've been wanting to see this play for so long.
[01:40:44.500 --> 01:40:46.620]   I've heard it's all the reviews from the time.
[01:40:46.620 --> 01:40:47.980]   Like, oh, this is historically funny.
[01:40:47.980 --> 01:40:48.980]   This is wonderful.
[01:40:48.980 --> 01:40:50.340]   You got to go see this.
[01:40:50.340 --> 01:40:54.940]   And it's going to be streaming on the site for the next week starting Thursday night.
[01:40:54.940 --> 01:40:58.980]   And I'm going to be using downy to make sure I capture it so that I can actually add it
[01:40:58.980 --> 01:41:01.900]   to my library and actually use it.
[01:41:01.900 --> 01:41:07.060]   And I'm being I'm being I'm if there is a donation page on the streaming site, I will
[01:41:07.060 --> 01:41:09.380]   donate and pretend that this is our.
[01:41:09.380 --> 01:41:10.380]   Okay.
[01:41:10.380 --> 01:41:11.380]   Well, he was so good.
[01:41:11.380 --> 01:41:12.380]   He was so good.
[01:41:12.380 --> 01:41:17.140]   I was just never never forget.
[01:41:17.140 --> 01:41:20.380]   But yeah, he'll live that down.
[01:41:20.380 --> 01:41:25.500]   This is we got he's got to live that down for the year to but then he'll be back.
[01:41:25.500 --> 01:41:27.140]   But it's but it's a great utility.
[01:41:27.140 --> 01:41:31.780]   Almost any any streaming site you can name apart from, you know, hulu and Netflix where
[01:41:31.780 --> 01:41:33.220]   and who an HBO.
[01:41:33.220 --> 01:41:37.420]   But any time that there any time that you're on Reddit or or social media and it's a click
[01:41:37.420 --> 01:41:42.620]   this link to watch this video stream or watch this watch this thing on YouTube or in this
[01:41:42.620 --> 01:41:43.780]   file.
[01:41:43.780 --> 01:41:48.140]   You just simply navigate to it with your browser, click a button in a browser plugin
[01:41:48.140 --> 01:41:52.500]   and it simply opens or you just copy the URL, paste it in and it will just automatically
[01:41:52.500 --> 01:41:55.060]   figure out where the video file is and download it.
[01:41:55.060 --> 01:41:59.540]   If for some reason it can't locate the video file, it even has a full web browser built
[01:41:59.540 --> 01:42:03.020]   in the mode that that calls user guided extraction.
[01:42:03.020 --> 01:42:06.980]   So if you need to, it's they don't charge if the if the streamer doesn't charge money
[01:42:06.980 --> 01:42:10.380]   for it, but you have to like log in like with your Google account or your Apple account
[01:42:10.380 --> 01:42:11.380]   or whatever.
[01:42:11.380 --> 01:42:15.380]   It will allow you to within the downy app actually open up a web browser, do all the
[01:42:15.380 --> 01:42:18.980]   authentication you need to do and then when it starts streaming, you'll see this beautiful
[01:42:18.980 --> 01:42:22.860]   like all these like lights sort of light up in the in the sidebar of all the different
[01:42:22.860 --> 01:42:26.380]   sources of video that it sees and then you click on one that looks like, okay, this looks
[01:42:26.380 --> 01:42:31.180]   like a 4k stream and then you say, ah, downloading 14 14 gigabytes of video.
[01:42:31.180 --> 01:42:32.180]   Boom.
[01:42:32.180 --> 01:42:37.340]   So anyway, 20 bucks and boy, this is another one of those things where I couldn't have
[01:42:37.340 --> 01:42:42.100]   paid the money fast enough because really well done and I really hope that he keeps
[01:42:42.100 --> 01:42:46.300]   keeps added because he not only it's not only built up a good app, but he keeps updating
[01:42:46.300 --> 01:42:50.540]   it constantly and I'd like to support that with my money.
[01:42:50.540 --> 01:43:02.100]   And now our pick of the week from Lori Gill, who has picked something unusual.
[01:43:02.100 --> 01:43:04.220]   It's pretty cool actually.
[01:43:04.220 --> 01:43:06.380]   So it's called final wipe.
[01:43:06.380 --> 01:43:10.220]   It's from a committee called final and they make something called final straw, which is
[01:43:10.220 --> 01:43:11.780]   a reusable straw.
[01:43:11.780 --> 01:43:17.220]   So they've come up with a fine, a disinfectant wipe that is reusable.
[01:43:17.220 --> 01:43:19.380]   So you can clean your surfaces.
[01:43:19.380 --> 01:43:20.380]   You can.
[01:43:20.380 --> 01:43:22.660]   Which surfaces is it for?
[01:43:22.660 --> 01:43:25.060]   Soft surfaces as well as all the surfaces.
[01:43:25.060 --> 01:43:26.620]   All the surfaces.
[01:43:26.620 --> 01:43:27.620]   Okay.
[01:43:27.620 --> 01:43:28.620]   Your Microsoft surfaces.
[01:43:28.620 --> 01:43:29.620]   Yeah.
[01:43:29.620 --> 01:43:30.620]   This is weird.
[01:43:30.620 --> 01:43:32.620]   It's a cloth.
[01:43:32.620 --> 01:43:33.620]   Yeah.
[01:43:33.620 --> 01:43:39.940]   So it's really, I mean, if you think about it, you can do this at home with your bleaching
[01:43:39.940 --> 01:43:42.860]   and water thing.
[01:43:42.860 --> 01:43:47.500]   But what's interesting about what I do like about it, it's not very expensive for one
[01:43:47.500 --> 01:43:48.500]   thing.
[01:43:48.500 --> 01:43:55.460]   And it gives you the sensation of using disposable sanitizing wipes the way that you would at
[01:43:55.460 --> 01:43:56.460]   home.
[01:43:56.460 --> 01:44:02.540]   People don't want to put out the extra effort of using a sanitizer and a towel.
[01:44:02.540 --> 01:44:04.900]   So this acts like it's doing that for you.
[01:44:04.900 --> 01:44:08.820]   So you feel like you're just using a wipe really quickly and then you toss it in your
[01:44:08.820 --> 01:44:14.260]   laundry and then you fill it back up again because it's a container that's filled with
[01:44:14.260 --> 01:44:18.060]   sanitizing solution that you have your towels all folded into.
[01:44:18.060 --> 01:44:23.140]   So it acts like it's a sanitizing, a disposable sanitizing wipe, but it's not.
[01:44:23.140 --> 01:44:25.020]   You just wash them and do it again.
[01:44:25.020 --> 01:44:26.420]   So that's what I really like about this.
[01:44:26.420 --> 01:44:31.300]   I actually hate using sanitizing wipes around the house and did not actually have any in
[01:44:31.300 --> 01:44:40.060]   my house when the coronavirus started getting spread worldwide and I couldn't find any sanitizing
[01:44:40.060 --> 01:44:45.980]   disinfectant wipes because I didn't keep them in the house because I don't want to waste
[01:44:45.980 --> 01:44:47.500]   all that extra paper.
[01:44:47.500 --> 01:44:51.940]   So with this, it's reusable and it still gives you the same sort of sensation that you're
[01:44:51.940 --> 01:44:55.300]   just quickly pulling it out, you wipe it down, the only difference is you toss it in your
[01:44:55.300 --> 01:44:57.460]   laundry instead of in the garbage can.
[01:44:57.460 --> 01:44:59.300]   So it's kind of a neat little thing.
[01:44:59.300 --> 01:45:00.700]   Now, can you they're on Kickstarter?
[01:45:00.700 --> 01:45:04.900]   Can you get them now or are you ordering this for some distance timeline?
[01:45:04.900 --> 01:45:10.700]   Yeah, I think they say that they're planning to ship August 2020, which obviously I wouldn't
[01:45:10.700 --> 01:45:18.740]   I would normally not take a Kickstarter shipping date as a real number, but in this time it's
[01:45:18.740 --> 01:45:22.780]   probably even worse like it's probably more difficult to get that kind of stuff shipped
[01:45:22.780 --> 01:45:23.780]   out.
[01:45:23.780 --> 01:45:28.620]   But final is a company that they've been around for a long time that like I said, they make
[01:45:28.620 --> 01:45:29.620]   the final straw.
[01:45:29.620 --> 01:45:31.380]   So they're a known company.
[01:45:31.380 --> 01:45:35.660]   They're not just some randos who've never successfully had a Kickstarter or anything.
[01:45:35.660 --> 01:45:39.540]   They're kicking themselves thinking we should have launched this six months ago.
[01:45:39.540 --> 01:45:40.540]   Yeah, right.
[01:45:40.540 --> 01:45:41.540]   Huge, right?
[01:45:41.540 --> 01:45:48.420]   My guess is the idea for this was to come out with this because this is April 1st starts
[01:45:48.420 --> 01:45:49.660]   you know, environmental month.
[01:45:49.660 --> 01:45:52.020]   It's Earth Day is on the 22nd.
[01:45:52.020 --> 01:45:53.020]   Oh, yeah, that's right.
[01:45:53.020 --> 01:45:54.020]   So they were probably originally.
[01:45:54.020 --> 01:45:55.020]   It was a big rush.
[01:45:55.020 --> 01:45:56.020]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:45:56.020 --> 01:46:00.220]   And then they might have even launched a little early thinking, well, you know, this is a
[01:46:00.220 --> 01:46:03.500]   really good time to launch this kind of thing because it's disinfectant wipes, which everybody
[01:46:03.500 --> 01:46:04.500]   wants right now.
[01:46:04.500 --> 01:46:06.300]   I love the team, by the way.
[01:46:06.300 --> 01:46:11.380]   It's mostly women and one guy and one dog.
[01:46:11.380 --> 01:46:12.780]   And the CEO.
[01:46:12.780 --> 01:46:15.780]   Someone has to test it.
[01:46:15.780 --> 01:46:17.820]   Yeah, right.
[01:46:17.820 --> 01:46:22.860]   The CEO and founder has a master's from Harvard Environmental Management and Sustainability
[01:46:22.860 --> 01:46:29.180]   and worked in waste minimization at the Los Alamos National Lab before starting finals.
[01:46:29.180 --> 01:46:31.100]   So it's kind of cool.
[01:46:31.100 --> 01:46:32.100]   Yeah.
[01:46:32.100 --> 01:46:36.220]   And if you want something from the company that already does exist, they make the final
[01:46:36.220 --> 01:46:40.780]   straw, which is a reusable straw that folds down to about two inches.
[01:46:40.780 --> 01:46:44.260]   I think I have a spare one around here somewhere that I would like to show you.
[01:46:44.260 --> 01:46:49.260]   But it folds down to about two inches tall so you can throw it in your purse, your backpack,
[01:46:49.260 --> 01:46:50.260]   your bag.
[01:46:50.260 --> 01:46:53.860]   When you go to restaurants, you can just pull it out, use it instead of having to use the
[01:46:53.860 --> 01:46:54.940]   plastic straws.
[01:46:54.940 --> 01:46:56.620]   You shove it back in your little container.
[01:46:56.620 --> 01:46:58.860]   It comes with its own cleaning kit.
[01:46:58.860 --> 01:47:05.780]   So it has a little, like a pipe cleaner with a scrubber on the end of it so you can even
[01:47:05.780 --> 01:47:09.420]   just take it in the bathroom if you carry this around at work or something like that, scrub
[01:47:09.420 --> 01:47:10.980]   it out and then put it right back in.
[01:47:10.980 --> 01:47:11.980]   So they're pretty great.
[01:47:11.980 --> 01:47:12.980]   I got everybody for Christmas.
[01:47:12.980 --> 01:47:13.980]   Oh, that's a good deal.
[01:47:13.980 --> 01:47:15.540]   A couple years ago, I got them final straws.
[01:47:15.540 --> 01:47:18.460]   They're not very expensive and it helps people.
[01:47:18.460 --> 01:47:20.940]   I guess we know what we're getting this Christmas.
[01:47:20.940 --> 01:47:22.900]   Some sanitizing wipes.
[01:47:22.900 --> 01:47:25.500]   They do custom logos.
[01:47:25.500 --> 01:47:27.900]   Or just my face.
[01:47:27.900 --> 01:47:29.820]   Just put my face on it.
[01:47:29.820 --> 01:47:30.820]   Yes.
[01:47:30.820 --> 01:47:32.780]   People will be happy to use it.
[01:47:32.780 --> 01:47:34.460]   What is the chemical in here that they say?
[01:47:34.460 --> 01:47:35.460]   They don't.
[01:47:35.460 --> 01:47:37.260]   They don't actually say.
[01:47:37.260 --> 01:47:41.260]   I didn't watch the official video.
[01:47:41.260 --> 01:47:46.500]   They might say it in the video, but they just say that it's non-toxic.
[01:47:46.500 --> 01:47:47.500]   That's all the information.
[01:47:47.500 --> 01:47:49.260]   Well, I hope it's toxic to germs.
[01:47:49.260 --> 01:47:51.620]   Yeah, they may not want to kill the germs.
[01:47:51.620 --> 01:47:52.620]   To kill the germs.
[01:47:52.620 --> 01:47:53.620]   Right.
[01:47:53.620 --> 01:47:56.300]   And the cloth is silver lines as an antimicrobial.
[01:47:56.300 --> 01:47:57.300]   Yep.
[01:47:57.300 --> 01:47:59.220]   And made a bamboo.
[01:47:59.220 --> 01:48:01.580]   Bamboo, the big bamboo.
[01:48:01.580 --> 01:48:06.940]   So they're definitely trying to be environmentally sustainable.
[01:48:06.940 --> 01:48:07.940]   Go to Kickstarter.
[01:48:07.940 --> 01:48:11.980]   Search for final wipe or as we say, final wipe.
[01:48:11.980 --> 01:48:15.420]   And you can get in on that.
[01:48:15.420 --> 01:48:20.420]   Can I share my ignorance?
[01:48:20.420 --> 01:48:21.660]   I saw this in the run though.
[01:48:21.660 --> 01:48:23.020]   I didn't actually click the link.
[01:48:23.020 --> 01:48:29.460]   I thought that is this like sort of open source version of final cut or parody of final cut?
[01:48:29.460 --> 01:48:30.460]   Unrelated.
[01:48:30.460 --> 01:48:32.020]   Unrelated video editing.
[01:48:32.020 --> 01:48:33.020]   It's transition.
[01:48:33.020 --> 01:48:34.020]   It's transition.
[01:48:34.020 --> 01:48:35.020]   It's a final wipe.
[01:48:35.020 --> 01:48:36.020]   Yeah.
[01:48:36.020 --> 01:48:38.220]   There you go.
[01:48:38.220 --> 01:48:47.060]   And I'm just curious, is the mermaid Emma Rose Cohen is the founder, the model for the mermaid
[01:48:47.060 --> 01:48:48.060]   on the front?
[01:48:48.060 --> 01:48:49.060]   I'm curious now.
[01:48:49.060 --> 01:48:51.060]   Disney's gonna be mad.
[01:48:51.060 --> 01:48:52.300]   Disney's gonna be mad.
[01:48:52.300 --> 01:48:55.380]   She has a certain aerial flair to her, doesn't she?
[01:48:55.380 --> 01:48:57.500]   I would say.
[01:48:57.500 --> 01:49:03.100]   Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes this thrilling gripping edition of Mac Break Weekly.
[01:49:03.100 --> 01:49:06.820]   Lori Gill is at imore.com where she is a managing editor.
[01:49:06.820 --> 01:49:12.700]   She's also, of course, the star of Sickburn currently on hiatus, they're letting their
[01:49:12.700 --> 01:49:14.820]   throats recover.
[01:49:14.820 --> 01:49:20.060]   You can find her though on the Twitter, Apoholic, A-P-P-A-H-O-L-I.
[01:49:20.060 --> 01:49:21.060]   Okay.
[01:49:21.060 --> 01:49:23.060]   Thank you, Lori.
[01:49:23.060 --> 01:49:24.060]   Thank you.
[01:49:24.060 --> 01:49:25.060]   Yes.
[01:49:25.060 --> 01:49:30.020]   Andy Inaco, he's on WGBH Boston.
[01:49:30.020 --> 01:49:31.940]   Were you pushed last week?
[01:49:31.940 --> 01:49:35.300]   No, but it was on Friday at 1230.
[01:49:35.300 --> 01:49:36.380]   I'm on most Fridays.
[01:49:36.380 --> 01:49:38.300]   I'm on this Friday at 1130.
[01:49:38.300 --> 01:49:40.580]   You get to hear me.
[01:49:40.580 --> 01:49:44.500]   You don't get to see me from the studio, but you get to hear me from the studio because
[01:49:44.500 --> 01:49:45.500]   we are isolated.
[01:49:45.500 --> 01:49:46.700]   Oh, yes.
[01:49:46.700 --> 01:49:49.140]   So you're gonna do it from there where you are right now?
[01:49:49.140 --> 01:49:54.140]   I'm gonna do it, which is wonderful because normally, like, I have to know everything before
[01:49:54.140 --> 01:49:55.540]   I go in there.
[01:49:55.540 --> 01:50:01.300]   But sometimes, because of all the stuff I've got, I can actually quietly say, "Well, there
[01:50:01.300 --> 01:50:07.020]   are a lot of factors involved in what would make that work in our society while I'm quietly
[01:50:07.020 --> 01:50:09.020]   typing and googling for information."
[01:50:09.020 --> 01:50:11.020]   I think I remember that kind of picture.
[01:50:11.020 --> 01:50:12.020]   No, we know your secret.
[01:50:12.020 --> 01:50:15.860]   There's nothing like a fine Matias keyboard for soft typing.
[01:50:15.860 --> 01:50:20.180]   I used to have a clickety keyboard, and now I've got a nice song.
[01:50:20.180 --> 01:50:23.180]   Sorry, that's my dehumidifier.
[01:50:23.180 --> 01:50:25.540]   A lot of relays.
[01:50:25.540 --> 01:50:29.140]   It's an old, real-world, real-world selfish.
[01:50:29.140 --> 01:50:34.460]   And of course, Renee Ritchie, who is now officially a YouTube star.
[01:50:34.460 --> 01:50:35.460]   Out the door.
[01:50:35.460 --> 01:50:37.060]   She took me right out the door, Leo.
[01:50:37.060 --> 01:50:40.060]   YouTube.com/ReneeRitchie, C-H-I-E.
[01:50:40.060 --> 01:50:43.420]   He's also a Renee Ritchie on Twitter.
[01:50:43.420 --> 01:50:44.420]   Congratulations.
[01:50:44.420 --> 01:50:45.420]   Thank you so much.
[01:50:45.420 --> 01:50:46.420]   Good luck.
[01:50:46.420 --> 01:50:48.460]   Now, what is your video production schedule?
[01:50:48.460 --> 01:50:49.700]   Are you gonna be doing daily?
[01:50:49.700 --> 01:50:57.020]   Yeah, I'm gonna try to do Monday to Thursday, just analysis shows, and then Friday or Saturday,
[01:50:57.020 --> 01:50:58.020]   a deeper dive show.
[01:50:58.020 --> 01:50:59.700]   We'll see if we can stick to that.
[01:50:59.700 --> 01:51:01.700]   It might slip to three new shows and a deep dive.
[01:51:01.700 --> 01:51:02.700]   It's a lot of work.
[01:51:02.700 --> 01:51:05.060]   But you were doing vector daily.
[01:51:05.060 --> 01:51:06.060]   You can do it.
[01:51:06.060 --> 01:51:07.540]   I was doing it like three to four times a week.
[01:51:07.540 --> 01:51:08.540]   Oh, okay.
[01:51:08.540 --> 01:51:09.540]   Okay.
[01:51:09.540 --> 01:51:10.540]   Yeah.
[01:51:10.540 --> 01:51:16.580]   I'm just, I gotta say, before we close, I have always been amazed and inspired by Renee's
[01:51:16.580 --> 01:51:17.580]   work ethic.
[01:51:17.580 --> 01:51:21.300]   He sets a goal, and he doesn't just meet it, but he exceeds it.
[01:51:21.300 --> 01:51:26.620]   And I would not have thought that he could have taken his wonderful work as a written
[01:51:26.620 --> 01:51:33.660]   journalist, and not only be so prolific on YouTube, but also create so many videos.
[01:51:33.660 --> 01:51:38.420]   Have such a consistent, high level of quality for content and for video.
[01:51:38.420 --> 01:51:46.820]   And I could not say, Renee, how excited I was to, but if this is how good a video channel
[01:51:46.820 --> 01:51:52.460]   Renee can do when he's part-timing it, imagine when he's got his full attention.
[01:51:52.460 --> 01:51:53.460]   So this is going to be something.
[01:51:53.460 --> 01:51:56.700]   I don't know if you have t-shirts yet, but give me an XL.
[01:51:56.700 --> 01:51:58.700]   Oh, that logo, right?
[01:51:58.700 --> 01:52:01.340]   His R-R logo is so nice.
[01:52:01.340 --> 01:52:02.340]   I love that.
[01:52:02.340 --> 01:52:03.340]   That is cool.
[01:52:03.340 --> 01:52:04.340]   Yes.
[01:52:04.340 --> 01:52:05.340]   I mean, bookmaster, I had forgotten towel.
[01:52:05.340 --> 01:52:08.340]   I thought, and I talked to the nice, who Chiker's Guide reference.
[01:52:08.340 --> 01:52:09.780]   I'd forgotten towel on Twitter.
[01:52:09.780 --> 01:52:11.780]   That would be a fantastic t-shirt.
[01:52:11.780 --> 01:52:12.780]   Right?
[01:52:12.780 --> 01:52:13.780]   Yeah.
[01:52:13.780 --> 01:52:14.780]   I agree.
[01:52:14.780 --> 01:52:16.820]   Well, people will be calling me her name from time to time, but that could work in my
[01:52:16.820 --> 01:52:17.820]   favorite.
[01:52:17.820 --> 01:52:18.820]   Subscribe.
[01:52:18.820 --> 01:52:21.420]   I think you've gone up about a thousand subscribers just since the show began.
[01:52:21.420 --> 01:52:26.380]   So everybody get on over there, ring the bell, press the button, the red button, ring
[01:52:26.380 --> 01:52:27.380]   the bell.
[01:52:27.380 --> 01:52:30.460]   Renee Richie, YouTube.com/ReneeRitchie.
[01:52:30.460 --> 01:52:31.460]   Thank you, Renee.
[01:52:31.460 --> 01:52:32.980]   I appreciate all of you.
[01:52:32.980 --> 01:52:35.940]   Thank you for spending your COVID time with us today.
[01:52:35.940 --> 01:52:38.780]   You're a candid hour.
[01:52:38.780 --> 01:52:40.500]   Our quarantine content.
[01:52:40.500 --> 01:52:46.460]   Again, those of us who do live alone, it's like, I'm so glad to have human contact even
[01:52:46.460 --> 01:52:50.420]   through this weird, flat piece of glass of window.
[01:52:50.420 --> 01:52:51.420]   To see your faces.
[01:52:51.420 --> 01:52:52.500]   It is not so bad, is it?
[01:52:52.500 --> 01:52:54.300]   It's kind of hanging out with your buddies.
[01:52:54.300 --> 01:52:55.300]   Exactly.
[01:52:55.300 --> 01:52:56.300]   We do it every Tuesday.
[01:52:56.300 --> 01:52:57.300]   It's always fun.
[01:52:57.300 --> 01:52:58.300]   Now it's more, now it's also mental health.
[01:52:58.300 --> 01:52:59.300]   It's a media break.
[01:52:59.300 --> 01:53:00.300]   It's a media break.
[01:53:00.300 --> 01:53:01.300]   It's a quarantine proof.
[01:53:01.300 --> 01:53:02.300]   Leo, the show's quarantine proof.
[01:53:02.300 --> 01:53:03.300]   Yeah.
[01:53:03.300 --> 01:53:04.300]   Well, it is with his Brady Box thing.
[01:53:04.300 --> 01:53:07.020]   We've got these panels are made out of solid steel.
[01:53:07.020 --> 01:53:08.020]   Yeah.
[01:53:08.020 --> 01:53:09.020]   Yeah.
[01:53:09.020 --> 01:53:10.020]   Yeah.
[01:53:10.020 --> 01:53:11.020]   Yeah.
[01:53:11.020 --> 01:53:12.020]   Yeah.
[01:53:12.020 --> 01:53:15.260]   We do Mac break weekly on Tuesdays, 11 AM Pacific.
[01:53:15.260 --> 01:53:17.220]   Right after iOS today, actually be a good thing.
[01:53:17.220 --> 01:53:19.580]   Just tune in for the whole morning because it's all iOS.
[01:53:19.580 --> 01:53:22.140]   And then of course, afterwards, security now.
[01:53:22.140 --> 01:53:24.900]   So really Tuesday is a great day to listen all day.
[01:53:24.900 --> 01:53:26.860]   And I think we've all got the time.
[01:53:26.860 --> 01:53:30.500]   We're going a little bit bad in here.
[01:53:30.500 --> 01:53:32.860]   I'm just a little bit bad.
[01:53:32.860 --> 01:53:35.860]   I really tried.
[01:53:35.860 --> 01:53:40.380]   11 AM Pacific, 2 PM Eastern time 1700 UTC.
[01:53:40.380 --> 01:53:41.380]   Come by, say hi.
[01:53:41.380 --> 01:53:44.740]   You can watch the live stream or listen at Twitter TV slash live.
[01:53:44.740 --> 01:53:49.820]   All of our shows are available on demand, not only on YouTube, of course, youtube.com/twit.
[01:53:49.820 --> 01:53:52.340]   And then you got to get your phone.
[01:53:52.340 --> 01:53:57.340]   You got to get your phone and then pull it down and then.
[01:53:57.340 --> 01:53:59.140]   Oh, it changed colors.
[01:53:59.140 --> 01:54:01.860]   It turned into stark green coming down.
[01:54:01.860 --> 01:54:04.020]   Oh, they're having such fun.
[01:54:04.020 --> 01:54:05.020]   Watch the video.
[01:54:05.020 --> 01:54:06.020]   You'll understand.
[01:54:06.020 --> 01:54:10.020]   See that's what this way you got to watch those phones coming down from Canada.
[01:54:10.020 --> 01:54:19.820]   Twitter TV slash MBW is the website.
[01:54:19.820 --> 01:54:36.900]   Like, I don't know, echo play Mac break weekly.
[01:54:36.900 --> 01:54:38.540]   And I hope you stay safe and stay healthy.
[01:54:38.540 --> 01:54:39.540]   And we'll see you next time.
[01:54:39.540 --> 01:54:46.020]   And now get back to work or lunch or your bunny slippers, whatever, whatever is most
[01:54:46.020 --> 01:54:49.740]   meaningful to you because break time is all.
[01:54:49.740 --> 01:54:51.340]   Bye bye.
[01:54:51.340 --> 01:55:01.340]   [MUSIC]
