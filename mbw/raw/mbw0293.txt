[00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:44.080]   Yeah.
[00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:48.280]   Hey, look, it's Adam Anxt of the tidbit, the tidbit sky with his giant penguin.
[00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:50.280]   Adam, that's not a Linux penguin.
[00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:51.280]   That's not a Tox.
[00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:53.160]   No, no, no, no.
[00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:55.400]   This has been one came all the way from Australia.
[00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:59.280]   And it must have just gotten lost given that you still have to go a hell of a long way
[00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.840]   to get Antarctica.
[00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:02.840]   Very nice to see you.
[00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:03.840]   Welcome back.
[00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:07.880]   tidbits.com is the longest running Macintosh publication out there.
[00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:08.880]   Long is still running.
[00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:09.880]   They're older ones.
[00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:11.880]   Yeah, 22 years coming up.
[00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:12.880]   Yeah.
[00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:17.480]   I think bite did a Macintosh article in 1984, but they're not.
[00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:19.480]   So that's why you win the title.
[00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:24.200]   Well, and I do have to allow Mac world, you know, but you know, they came online late
[00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:25.200]   to the game.
[00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:26.200]   Right.
[00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:27.560]   We're still going for the online record.
[00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:28.560]   All right.
[00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:29.560]   Nice to have you, Adam.
[00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:30.720]   It's great to have you.
[00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:33.720]   Also here for, we'll enjoy them while we can.
[00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:35.520]   Two weeks in a row.
[00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:36.520]   Two weeks in a row.
[00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:38.200]   Mr. Alex Lindsey of the Pixel Core.
[00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:39.880]   Mr. He's a traveling man.
[00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:40.880]   Yes.
[00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:41.880]   Oh, shoot.
[00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:43.080]   I forgot.
[00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:45.400]   I was looking at your new Mofie case, which I'm sure you're going to talk about.
[00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:49.440]   I have a Thunderbolt drive, but I left it in my, I left it at home.
[00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:51.400]   Oh, you got, you got the new one?
[00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:54.040]   I got a, I got one from, is that the Elgato?
[00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:55.040]   Yeah, something like that.
[00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:56.040]   It's 128.
[00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:57.040]   Well, I don't know.
[00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:00.040]   I had to borrow a cable from you $50.
[00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:01.840]   It doesn't come with a cable.
[00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:02.840]   Well, because it's $50.
[00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:05.960]   Then it would affect their, you know, their bottom line, the bottom line.
[00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:08.440]   So it's so it's going to affect my bottom line instead.
[00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:09.440]   Yeah, she's the wheeze.
[00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:11.040]   They are fast, though.
[00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:13.600]   Well, yeah, and they're small.
[00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:14.600]   Right.
[00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:18.080]   They're like a really good, bad and weight fighter, fast, but small.
[00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:19.080]   Yeah.
[00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:20.080]   They'll expect capacity.
[00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:24.600]   Also, here, Andy Inaco, the Chicago Sun Times and his favorite squirrel.
[00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:25.600]   Here you go.
[00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:28.120]   It's definitely the Travis Bickle of a drive-in-a-back.
[00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:29.120]   It's feisty.
[00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:30.600]   Small, but very, very dangerous.
[00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:31.600]   Feisty.
[00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:32.600]   Yeah.
[00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:34.240]   So, okay, forget the news.
[00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:35.840]   I got a tech support question.
[00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:38.080]   Here we go.
[00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:40.400]   You've come to the right place.
[00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:41.880]   It's driving me crazy.
[00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:46.920]   So, you know, I, as you, as I was explaining before the show, I foolishly, you know, there's
[00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:47.920]   this thing called liquid pill.
[00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:55.160]   They were at CES where they spray, they spray your iPhone or your device with a nano coating
[00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:57.000]   that's supposed to make it waterproof.
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   Turns out.
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.000]   It's not.
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   Okay.
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   We don't have to belabor it.
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.520]   If you want to watch iPad today, you can see me dunk my phone.
[00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:07.840]   So I brought it in yesterday to my, my, my little favorite iPhone repair place.
[00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:08.840]   These guys are great.
[00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:09.840]   They're such geeks and they take it apart.
[00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:10.840]   They replace every piece.
[00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:11.840]   Still doesn't work.
[00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:14.120]   They said, you know, we think it's probably the logic board.
[00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:16.720]   And you know, you might as well at that point, bring it to Apple and look at a new
[00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:17.720]   phone and Apple's very nice.
[00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:21.520]   And I don't know if they have to do this because I didn't have Apple care, but they,
[00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:24.520]   I told them right up front, I said, um, the phone is wet.
[00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:28.240]   It got wet and he looks in the, you know, he can look in the headphone port and see the
[00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:29.240]   red strips.
[00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:30.240]   Yeah.
[00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:31.240]   He said, yeah, it got wet.
[00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:32.240]   And he took out the sim.
[00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:37.280]   He said, wow, because the sim apparently caught on fire or sound.
[00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:40.760]   It's like, he said, we can't, you're going to have to get a new sim because this is like,
[00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:41.760]   it's not, I said that corrosion.
[00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:43.160]   He said, I don't think it's corrosion.
[00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:44.760]   I think it's a short circuit.
[00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:46.920]   It's like melted.
[00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:48.520]   So it was like nasty, right?
[00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:49.520]   It wasn't.
[00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:50.920]   I mean, it didn't just go down.
[00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:52.320]   It went down hard.
[00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:56.120]   And I, and I didn't bring up that I had intentionally dunked it in glass of water.
[00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:59.720]   But when he brought, so you were, you were open, but not completely.
[00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:03.240]   Well, the funny thing is when he brought it back, he said, I, I don't want to say anything,
[00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:10.240]   but is this because of the liquid PEL thing you did on, on, I said, yeah, yeah, I said,
[00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:12.120]   and then I said, all right, but I don't like to pull rack.
[00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:13.640]   I never liked to say, hey, do you know who I am?
[00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:14.640]   I'm Leo LaPorque.
[00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:15.640]   Could you fix my phone?
[00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:16.920]   And he had made me the offer before.
[00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:17.920]   Right.
[00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:18.920]   You know, any of that.
[00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:19.920]   So it was nice.
[00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:20.920]   So that was good.
[00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:21.920]   I don't know if they have to do it.
[00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:25.240]   I think the genius has some leeway in that he said, like, if we can't, if they, if we
[00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:30.400]   can't recover any of the components, like if he said, if a car drove over and it smashed,
[00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:33.600]   I can't, I can't give you a new phone because I can't, I said, you're going to try to recover
[00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:36.160]   components from this scorched phone.
[00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:39.040]   He said, oh yeah, we can get some of this stuff back.
[00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:40.640]   And so that's why they'll give you a $200.
[00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:41.640]   They'll give you a new phone.
[00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:43.360]   Anyway, so I got a brand new one.
[00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:45.280]   And then I'm doing the iCloud restore.
[00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:50.080]   And I remember, oh yeah, because I did this with the new iPad, waiting, waiting, everything,
[00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:52.720]   waiting, waiting, you know, nothing's restoring.
[00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:55.360]   So I thought, oh, no problem, because I have backed this up.
[00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:59.040]   I will bring it to my computer and I synced it with iTunes.
[00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:02.560]   Still waiting, waiting, waiting, waiting.
[00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:04.120]   You know, there's a funny little thing to get that started.
[00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:05.280]   I know you can double tap.
[00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:06.280]   I know that thing.
[00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:07.280]   Right.
[00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:08.280]   Yeah.
[00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:09.280]   But I'm not, I have hundreds of ads.
[00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:10.280]   But doesn't it just start after that?
[00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:11.280]   No, no, I am.
[00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:13.920]   I've been double tapping all day.
[00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:16.120]   So usually there's one that says loading.
[00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:17.640]   That's the problem is there's like one stock.
[00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:18.640]   Is that what it is?
[00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:19.640]   Yeah.
[00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:20.640]   So what do you do?
[00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:21.640]   You pause that one?
[00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:23.760]   Well, I think we, I've tried double tapping.
[00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:28.760]   I was doing some tests with iCloud backups and restores to see what iBooks would do
[00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:29.760]   with its data.
[00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:31.760]   And it ran into this at one point.
[00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:36.320]   And I think I ended up actually shutting the phone off and back on and then double tapping
[00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:38.040]   on the one that was loading.
[00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:39.440]   And eventually it did it.
[00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:41.240]   Really it wasn't happy about it though.
[00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:42.800]   It was not, it was not something like, we don't come in.
[00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:43.800]   It's extremely annoying.
[00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:47.920]   And because they now have the iCloud restore, even if you hook it up to the computer.
[00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:48.920]   It wants to do it.
[00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:49.920]   It wants to do it over here.
[00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:50.920]   It's from iCloud.
[00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:53.160]   If you started with, I'm going to restore from iCloud, it gets into that loop because
[00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:55.560]   then you know that when you first started because now it's a good loop.
[00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:56.560]   Yes.
[00:06:56.560 --> 00:06:58.360]   If you said I want to restore from my computer, it will restore from you.
[00:06:58.360 --> 00:06:59.360]   So that's what you should do.
[00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:00.360]   Well, if you wanted to do that.
[00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:04.200]   But you, but what you can do is you can go into, I forget what it is, general blah,
[00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:07.360]   blah, blah, blah, blah, and do a total of race, all content and research.
[00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:08.360]   That's what I did.
[00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:09.360]   You start over.
[00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:10.360]   You get a different backup.
[00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:11.360]   Yeah.
[00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:12.360]   That's what I did with the iPad.
[00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:13.360]   Yeah.
[00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:14.360]   Okay.
[00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:15.360]   So this is all because at one point I mentioned the word iCloud.
[00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:16.360]   Right.
[00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:17.360]   So you got to start over again if you want to.
[00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:20.360]   The phone says, but no dude, which is useful.
[00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:23.560]   Like for instance, for me, my iPhone got replaced last week too.
[00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:24.560]   I didn't dunk it in any water.
[00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:25.680]   Why cheers get replaced?
[00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:27.480]   So it stopped charging.
[00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:30.520]   Like it would slowly, every once in a while you had to do it a couple of times and then
[00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:32.080]   it wouldn't, the computer wouldn't recognize it.
[00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:35.120]   And this is where iCloud became really useful because I backed it up to iCloud.
[00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:36.280]   It would still see iCloud of course.
[00:07:36.280 --> 00:07:37.280]   Right.
[00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:40.680]   So I got charged, I backed it all up to iCloud and then I took it into the Apple Store and
[00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:42.480]   I just got a new one.
[00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:43.680]   And then I backed and then I've been.
[00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:45.800]   And they just swapped it right because it's still under warranty.
[00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:46.800]   It's less year old.
[00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:47.800]   Yeah, still under warranty.
[00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:48.800]   I didn't dunk in.
[00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:52.320]   So I bought, so I felt so grateful I bought the AppleCare Pro or Plus or whatever they
[00:07:52.320 --> 00:07:53.320]   call it.
[00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:54.320]   I did that.
[00:07:54.320 --> 00:07:55.320]   He says, I don't get a commission.
[00:07:55.320 --> 00:07:56.320]   I said, I know.
[00:07:56.320 --> 00:07:59.920]   And I, but I'm just so grateful that you gave me a new phone for $200.
[00:07:59.920 --> 00:08:04.120]   What I'm an immediate, but anyway, I, and I bought the additional AppleCare Plus.
[00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:05.120]   What the hell is that?
[00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:06.120]   I just bought it.
[00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:08.000]   For a hundred bucks, you're going to get a new iPhone if you break it.
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:09.000]   Let it work.
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:10.640]   You can dunk it in water, step on it, drop it out of a car.
[00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:12.480]   So bring the carcass over and you'll get it.
[00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:13.480]   Bring on the liquid pill.
[00:08:13.480 --> 00:08:14.480]   Yes.
[00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:17.440]   See, that's because now I don't mind because I get another one.
[00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:19.120]   I got such hate mail.
[00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:21.200]   People said, why did you do that?
[00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:26.160]   Well, if the problem was once I agreed to have my phone liquidpelled, right, you know,
[00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:29.000]   Huffington Post talks about it says, if it works, it's great.
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:30.000]   They don't try it.
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:31.640]   You got to try it.
[00:08:31.640 --> 00:08:32.640]   Right.
[00:08:32.640 --> 00:08:33.640]   Right.
[00:08:33.640 --> 00:08:36.760]   So you don't have to do it, Andy, and you don't have to do it, Alex, and you don't have
[00:08:36.760 --> 00:08:37.760]   to do it.
[00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:39.920]   And you don't have nobody has to do this.
[00:08:39.920 --> 00:08:41.760]   It doesn't work.
[00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:44.240]   Yeah, I've seen those products before.
[00:08:44.240 --> 00:08:46.040]   I've had people make those offers to me.
[00:08:46.040 --> 00:08:47.520]   Hey, we'll send you over a sample.
[00:08:47.520 --> 00:08:49.920]   We'll, whatever, whatever your phone.
[00:08:49.920 --> 00:08:53.320]   And I'm like, I'll take that meeting, but you're going to bring one of your own phones.
[00:08:53.320 --> 00:08:54.320]   Yeah.
[00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:57.520]   And then I'm going to try it out because this is, this means I have heard of that particular
[00:08:57.520 --> 00:09:01.240]   specific product and immediately I thought of this ad that I once saw in the back of
[00:09:01.240 --> 00:09:05.520]   some magazine about this special magic paint that repels traffic radar.
[00:09:05.520 --> 00:09:06.520]   Yeah.
[00:09:06.520 --> 00:09:11.040]   So it's easy for you to convince people like paint their cars, this magic stuff.
[00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:14.240]   But then, you know, you're telling me that this works in a way that I don't believe
[00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:15.760]   that physics actually works.
[00:09:15.760 --> 00:09:16.760]   Right.
[00:09:16.760 --> 00:09:17.760]   So, yeah.
[00:09:17.760 --> 00:09:21.040]   Well, didn't you do all those tests with cat litter and rice and whatnot for drying stuff
[00:09:21.040 --> 00:09:22.040]   out too, Andy?
[00:09:22.040 --> 00:09:26.520]   Yeah, but yeah, but the difference there was I call T-Mobile and said, can you send me
[00:09:26.520 --> 00:09:29.560]   six phones that we'll never ever get back again?
[00:09:29.560 --> 00:09:30.720]   Oh, that's neat.
[00:09:30.720 --> 00:09:34.280]   And by the way, which works the best for future living?
[00:09:34.280 --> 00:09:42.000]   Best answer is two answers, either dry rice or silicate based cat litter.
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:46.920]   Just put it inside a sealed plastic container like a Ziploc bag or piece of type of wear,
[00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:51.960]   completely covered in this stuff, seal it up, give it about a day and by the end of the
[00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:55.520]   day, most any moisture that could have been withdrawn from the phone will be withdrawn
[00:09:55.520 --> 00:09:56.520]   for it.
[00:09:56.520 --> 00:10:01.120]   Or if you happen to know somebody who uses a hearing aid, they actually probably own
[00:10:01.120 --> 00:10:06.560]   a special device that's built specifically to dry out hearing aids from whatever moisture
[00:10:06.560 --> 00:10:07.800]   they get involved in.
[00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:10.640]   You drop it in the side that I actually got actually barred one of these for the test.
[00:10:10.640 --> 00:10:13.760]   You drop it in this machine, give it about I think it's like a two hour cycle.
[00:10:13.760 --> 00:10:17.920]   And it's just this amazing little thing that just does nothing but remove moisture from
[00:10:17.920 --> 00:10:20.200]   anything that's inside that little coffin.
[00:10:20.200 --> 00:10:21.640]   But it's a $200 thing.
[00:10:21.640 --> 00:10:24.600]   You're probably not going to have that in your kitchen pantry when you drop, when you
[00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:25.600]   do your laundry.
[00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:29.720]   The other thing you could do, I save those little bags that say do not eat.
[00:10:29.720 --> 00:10:30.720]   Right.
[00:10:30.720 --> 00:10:31.720]   I don't eat them.
[00:10:31.720 --> 00:10:32.720]   That's good.
[00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:33.720]   That's a good start.
[00:10:33.720 --> 00:10:34.720]   You have a collection of these.
[00:10:34.720 --> 00:10:35.720]   I save them.
[00:10:35.720 --> 00:10:36.720]   Put them in Tupperware Seal.
[00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:37.720]   I mean, I don't keep them.
[00:10:37.720 --> 00:10:38.720]   They pile up.
[00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:42.560]   And you can bake them to desiccate them again if they've been exposed to the air because
[00:10:42.560 --> 00:10:45.320]   they suck moisture, but they're designed to keep electronics dry.
[00:10:45.320 --> 00:10:47.000]   So we had some industrial strength ones.
[00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.200]   I baked them in my oven.
[00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:50.400]   Be careful.
[00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:54.280]   Preheat the oven because you could actually, I actually melted the bags in the second
[00:10:54.280 --> 00:10:55.280]   time.
[00:10:55.280 --> 00:10:57.280]   That's why rice is my recommendation.
[00:10:57.280 --> 00:11:00.160]   You probably already have that in your pantry.
[00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:04.480]   Also if you want to get something, the kitty litter that's special, it's the crystal type
[00:11:04.480 --> 00:11:06.800]   kitty litter, not the kind with the clay in it.
[00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:10.560]   You can probably get that at the drug store at Walgreens next to your hotel late at night
[00:11:10.560 --> 00:11:12.080]   if it happens while you're traveling.
[00:11:12.080 --> 00:11:13.080]   That's good to know.
[00:11:13.080 --> 00:11:17.760]   I put my 3GS went through the warm cycle.
[00:11:17.760 --> 00:11:18.760]   That's good.
[00:11:18.760 --> 00:11:21.040]   We put it in rice for three days and popped it out and it worked just well.
[00:11:21.040 --> 00:11:23.000]   Yeah, often it does.
[00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:27.800]   The thing, so in liquid pills defense, they said, well, Leo, you did it wrong.
[00:11:27.800 --> 00:11:28.640]   Of course.
[00:11:28.640 --> 00:11:31.000]   Just put it in water.
[00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:35.440]   Sorry, your dog died, even though you use the magical holistic healing gel that we sent
[00:11:35.440 --> 00:11:37.200]   to you, you must have used it wrong.
[00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:38.800]   You didn't believe hard enough.
[00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:40.240]   Yes, you killed your dog.
[00:11:40.240 --> 00:11:43.360]   They said, and they send you a thing that says, don't get it wet.
[00:11:43.360 --> 00:11:44.360]   So that was the first thing.
[00:11:44.360 --> 00:11:45.360]   Don't get it wet.
[00:11:45.360 --> 00:11:48.680]   And then the, it's always cold water as long as you never get the phone.
[00:11:48.680 --> 00:11:50.800]   It says waterproof on the back of the case on the front.
[00:11:50.800 --> 00:11:52.880]   It gives you things that don't get it wet.
[00:11:52.880 --> 00:11:56.080]   If you get it wet and they're right on this, you do all the things that you all know.
[00:11:56.080 --> 00:11:57.080]   You pull the battery.
[00:11:57.080 --> 00:11:58.080]   Oh, it's an iPhone.
[00:11:58.080 --> 00:11:59.080]   But you pull the battery.
[00:11:59.080 --> 00:12:01.760]   If it hits, not an iPhone, you don't try to turn it on.
[00:12:01.760 --> 00:12:06.240]   They say, don't shake it because you don't want to disperse the water.
[00:12:06.240 --> 00:12:07.240]   Just stand it up.
[00:12:07.240 --> 00:12:12.280]   Let it drain and let it dry and don't try to use it for days and days and days.
[00:12:12.280 --> 00:12:13.680]   And of course, I didn't do any of that stuff.
[00:12:13.680 --> 00:12:14.680]   I shook it.
[00:12:14.680 --> 00:12:18.480]   I was trying to say, did it still work?
[00:12:18.480 --> 00:12:21.320]   Now of course, it's all the same things they do at C. Yes, they did see it.
[00:12:21.320 --> 00:12:22.720]   I mean, I wasn't doing anything they didn't do.
[00:12:22.720 --> 00:12:27.000]   But I understand, if you do decide to liquefell your phone, don't get it wet.
[00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:28.640]   Would be my advice.
[00:12:28.640 --> 00:12:33.920]   One of the piece of advice on any circumstances, it's always worth taking it to the Apple store
[00:12:33.920 --> 00:12:36.080]   and being very honest about what happens.
[00:12:36.080 --> 00:12:37.080]   They were great.
[00:12:37.080 --> 00:12:43.320]   Well, not only because they'll might swap it out for $199, but also because often they
[00:12:43.320 --> 00:12:47.320]   I talk to a lot of people who work in Genius Bar and a lot of different stores.
[00:12:47.320 --> 00:12:51.960]   And there isn't, it seems as though culturally, not officially, but culturally there is an
[00:12:51.960 --> 00:12:54.520]   unspoken policy of the we're awesome policy.
[00:12:54.520 --> 00:12:55.520]   Right.
[00:12:55.520 --> 00:12:58.440]   That says that if it's, if this person try to take care of their phone, they're going
[00:12:58.440 --> 00:13:01.920]   to try to take care of the customer and oftentimes that means that they will send you out with
[00:13:01.920 --> 00:13:05.200]   a new phone and a wag of the finger and saying, don't ever do this again.
[00:13:05.200 --> 00:13:07.040]   We now have your, we now have your number.
[00:13:07.040 --> 00:13:09.960]   We know that you're not going to, we know we're not going to do this again for you, but
[00:13:09.960 --> 00:13:11.600]   they might actually replace it for you.
[00:13:11.600 --> 00:13:16.120]   And that's actually goes double if when there's a brand new model of anything mobile that comes
[00:13:16.120 --> 00:13:21.320]   out, like the new iPad or when the new iPhone comes out, they're probably going to be more,
[00:13:21.320 --> 00:13:24.000]   they're also going to be more interested in saying, well, gee, this guy dropped the phone
[00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:25.000]   and that was his fault.
[00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:28.960]   That breaks the warranty, but we're kind of interested in seeing why it broke under these
[00:13:28.960 --> 00:13:30.320]   circumstances.
[00:13:30.320 --> 00:13:36.800]   So there's again, there's by warranty, they're not required to do anything except for to,
[00:13:36.800 --> 00:13:38.560]   I'm going to donate some notice of all school, right?
[00:13:38.560 --> 00:13:42.760]   Oh, me over your phone, but it's always worth coming in and being completely honest about
[00:13:42.760 --> 00:13:43.760]   what happened.
[00:13:43.760 --> 00:13:47.760]   If the worst, the worst that can happen is that the offer you sympathy and support, the
[00:13:47.760 --> 00:13:51.720]   best thing that could happen is they might send you home with a replacement phone.
[00:13:51.720 --> 00:13:56.280]   They, I got an email from an Apple genius who said, don't quote me, but they give us
[00:13:56.280 --> 00:13:57.280]   a lot of leeway.
[00:13:57.280 --> 00:14:00.000]   We do at the end of the day have to justify it to our manager.
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:03.440]   So you can't just be kind of go crazy, but they give us a lot of leeway and he says,
[00:14:03.440 --> 00:14:05.560]   if people are nice, we'll be nice back.
[00:14:05.560 --> 00:14:06.560]   Well, it's incredible.
[00:14:06.560 --> 00:14:11.520]   Actually went out on my Twitter feed and solicited feedback from my people, good and
[00:14:11.520 --> 00:14:12.520]   bad.
[00:14:12.520 --> 00:14:16.720]   Actually, I didn't lead the interrogation by saying, but I was getting so many stories
[00:14:16.720 --> 00:14:19.200]   exactly like that where I had an accident with it.
[00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:22.000]   They replaced it for me or I bought something for my mom.
[00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:24.080]   I thought that it had an HDMI cable with it.
[00:14:24.080 --> 00:14:25.080]   It didn't.
[00:14:25.080 --> 00:14:28.440]   They just simply took one off the peg and gave it to me.
[00:14:28.440 --> 00:14:33.680]   It's the buying something from Apple through the Apple store is such a huge value add.
[00:14:33.680 --> 00:14:36.800]   It's one of the probably the four or five things you could probably list that says that
[00:14:36.800 --> 00:14:41.040]   I don't know how other manufacturers can compete with Apple at certain things like customer
[00:14:41.040 --> 00:14:42.040]   service.
[00:14:42.040 --> 00:14:48.360]   I bought the iPhones at AT&T and Verizon and Apple and I've just gotten to the point now.
[00:14:48.360 --> 00:14:51.840]   I only go to an Apple store to buy it because it's just so much less trouble.
[00:14:51.840 --> 00:14:53.520]   My Apple care gets added automatically.
[00:14:53.520 --> 00:14:54.680]   I get taken care of.
[00:14:54.680 --> 00:14:55.680]   It's quick.
[00:14:55.680 --> 00:14:56.680]   It's easy.
[00:14:56.680 --> 00:14:59.560]   Well, to their credit, they never asked me, did you buy this here?
[00:14:59.560 --> 00:15:04.560]   No, no, no, but I'm saying that if you bring, what I'm saying is that the general experience
[00:15:04.560 --> 00:15:08.000]   is so good overall.
[00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:09.560]   It feels like it should be simple.
[00:15:09.560 --> 00:15:12.320]   But there's a mensoment of work to get that kind of stuff.
[00:15:12.320 --> 00:15:16.440]   And as the chat was pointing out, that's why you're paying the extra price.
[00:15:16.440 --> 00:15:17.440]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:15:17.440 --> 00:15:20.480]   Apple stuff costs more because they continue to give you support.
[00:15:20.480 --> 00:15:23.560]   Most of the PC companies unbundled support effectively.
[00:15:23.560 --> 00:15:26.880]   They got the price way, way down, but they don't, you know, you're 5% margin what you
[00:15:26.880 --> 00:15:30.160]   guys are not going to get support because you're not paying for it.
[00:15:30.160 --> 00:15:32.960]   There's a deli in Ann Arbor, Michigan, Zingerman's.
[00:15:32.960 --> 00:15:35.080]   Oh, I love Zingerman's.
[00:15:35.080 --> 00:15:36.080]   Yes.
[00:15:36.080 --> 00:15:38.960]   Everyone loves Zingerman's, but they actually have this really interesting customer service
[00:15:38.960 --> 00:15:46.480]   policy, which is that everyone down to the loneliest cashier can make something right
[00:15:46.480 --> 00:15:50.880]   for an unhappy customer up to $100 without asking anyone.
[00:15:50.880 --> 00:15:55.640]   And it's basically, I mean, because there was one after Mac Hack and they forget what
[00:15:55.640 --> 00:15:59.880]   it was, they were tasting, you know, having tastings of something and they ran out, you
[00:15:59.880 --> 00:16:02.940]   know, just as we were getting there and the woman was like, oh, hang on a second, she
[00:16:02.940 --> 00:16:06.680]   reaches up on the shelf and pulls down, you know, another box of these, you know, expensive,
[00:16:06.680 --> 00:16:09.760]   Spanish chocolate covered figs or something and hands, you know, and hands us, you know,
[00:16:09.760 --> 00:16:11.000]   so we get samples too.
[00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:12.760]   And it was just, you know, it was one of those things.
[00:16:12.760 --> 00:16:16.400]   She was like, yeah, that you go a little bit of an extra way and you get a customer for
[00:16:16.400 --> 00:16:17.400]   life.
[00:16:17.400 --> 00:16:19.600]   Well, we have that policy here at Twit.
[00:16:19.600 --> 00:16:25.120]   Any, anybody in the Twit office can make anybody whole up to $100.
[00:16:25.120 --> 00:16:29.960]   If you have a problem with your podcast, you tell us and we will make it actually, that's
[00:16:29.960 --> 00:16:30.960]   kind of true.
[00:16:30.960 --> 00:16:34.560]   And I don't really want to extend that offer because we accidentally, we made a little
[00:16:34.560 --> 00:16:38.560]   mistake on the factory floor when we were putting out Twit on Sunday.
[00:16:38.560 --> 00:16:40.800]   We put out, you know, we have Twit HD.
[00:16:40.800 --> 00:16:43.960]   It's the only show right now where we have a 720p version that's big.
[00:16:43.960 --> 00:16:45.880]   It's like almost two gigabytes.
[00:16:45.880 --> 00:16:48.240]   And we put, and it was the wrong last weeks.
[00:16:48.240 --> 00:16:53.760]   So if anybody downloaded the wrong podcast from Twit on Sunday, you have our deepest
[00:16:53.760 --> 00:17:00.240]   apologies and we will at no charge to you offer you last week's podcast completely free.
[00:17:00.240 --> 00:17:01.240]   No cost.
[00:17:01.240 --> 00:17:03.200]   And you'll even throw in free undercoating.
[00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:04.200]   Yes.
[00:17:04.200 --> 00:17:05.200]   On all that.
[00:17:05.200 --> 00:17:06.200]   On all that.
[00:17:06.200 --> 00:17:07.200]   Yeah.
[00:17:07.200 --> 00:17:08.200]   Yeah.
[00:17:08.200 --> 00:17:09.200]   Get liquid pill.
[00:17:09.200 --> 00:17:14.720]   So it's not surprising then when you hear stories like that, that things like this story,
[00:17:14.720 --> 00:17:21.800]   Apple jumps 10 places to get to the number one consumer brand in Japan.
[00:17:21.800 --> 00:17:26.360]   I mean, I think it's already probably the number one consumer brand in the US.
[00:17:26.360 --> 00:17:29.720]   But Japan's kind of a surprise because Apple's not traditionally done well overseas.
[00:17:29.720 --> 00:17:30.720]   No.
[00:17:30.720 --> 00:17:33.360]   And they have, and you always wonder how well the iPhone is going to do in places like
[00:17:33.360 --> 00:17:36.520]   Japan because the phones there are so few traansed.
[00:17:36.520 --> 00:17:41.360]   They're just so, you know, they have all these long phones, long white phones.
[00:17:41.360 --> 00:17:43.720]   They're basically, I think they're personal computers.
[00:17:43.720 --> 00:17:46.000]   Instead of having a person watching a TV on their phone.
[00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:47.000]   Yeah.
[00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:48.000]   Everyone's watching TV on their phone in the subway.
[00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:49.000]   It's crazy.
[00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:53.080]   So yeah, but you know, this is a JD power and associates, you know, the thing that the
[00:17:53.080 --> 00:17:55.600]   car companies always talk about.
[00:17:55.600 --> 00:17:58.040]   Customer satisfaction survey.
[00:17:58.040 --> 00:18:02.000]   It's not true across the board, but number one in consumer brands in Japan.
[00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:03.280]   Oh, I'm sorry.
[00:18:03.280 --> 00:18:04.280]   This is not.
[00:18:04.280 --> 00:18:06.520]   This is the Nikkei BP consulting survey.
[00:18:06.520 --> 00:18:08.480]   This is a different survey.
[00:18:08.480 --> 00:18:11.600]   JD power is in the US.
[00:18:11.600 --> 00:18:17.240]   Number one, scoring 90.5 points out of 100 for total brand power, then Google, then
[00:18:17.240 --> 00:18:24.880]   unit, unit, clo, unique low, unit, clo, is that, you know, it's Japanese, close.
[00:18:24.880 --> 00:18:25.880]   Yeah.
[00:18:25.880 --> 00:18:26.880]   Yeah.
[00:18:26.880 --> 00:18:27.880]   It's awesome.
[00:18:27.880 --> 00:18:28.880]   I love you.
[00:18:28.880 --> 00:18:34.560]   Number two, YouTube, separate from Google, YouTube has high brand recognition.
[00:18:34.560 --> 00:18:36.400]   How can you not satisfy if you're YouTube?
[00:18:36.400 --> 00:18:38.640]   What would you do wrong?
[00:18:38.640 --> 00:18:44.400]   Disney, McDonald's, Panasonic, Nissan, Dyson and Rakuten.
[00:18:44.400 --> 00:18:47.960]   So as Uniqlo, a Japanese company or is it a?
[00:18:47.960 --> 00:18:48.960]   Good question.
[00:18:48.960 --> 00:18:49.960]   I'm not sure.
[00:18:49.960 --> 00:18:52.560]   I discovered it in New York, but I think it might be.
[00:18:52.560 --> 00:18:56.960]   Because if it isn't, then the top Japanese companies, number seven on this list.
[00:18:56.960 --> 00:18:59.960]   Oh, do a search.
[00:18:59.960 --> 00:19:00.960]   Wow.
[00:19:00.960 --> 00:19:01.960]   Wow.
[00:19:01.960 --> 00:19:04.960]   Which I wish I could find out.
[00:19:04.960 --> 00:19:06.960]   Go ahead.
[00:19:06.960 --> 00:19:10.120]   I did try to find out exactly what the survey entailed every time.
[00:19:10.120 --> 00:19:13.800]   You see a lot of these surveys, some from analysts, some from just independent.
[00:19:13.800 --> 00:19:17.720]   And how are they, how are they saying most favorite brand?
[00:19:17.720 --> 00:19:20.400]   Are they going by sales or they going by satisfaction?
[00:19:20.400 --> 00:19:26.040]   Some of them go by, they do what they call cumulative influence index, where they try
[00:19:26.040 --> 00:19:29.600]   to figure out how much does a sale of, how much does a consumer interaction with this
[00:19:29.600 --> 00:19:32.480]   product lead to a second or third or fourth interaction?
[00:19:32.480 --> 00:19:33.480]   Right.
[00:19:33.480 --> 00:19:34.480]   So nice number.
[00:19:34.480 --> 00:19:36.480]   Nice thing for it to talk about over coffee one day.
[00:19:36.480 --> 00:19:37.480]   I'm not.
[00:19:37.480 --> 00:19:38.480]   I'm not sure.
[00:19:38.480 --> 00:19:39.480]   What is it about?
[00:19:39.480 --> 00:19:40.480]   How is it about?
[00:19:40.480 --> 00:19:41.480]   What does it mean?
[00:19:41.480 --> 00:19:42.480]   Yeah.
[00:19:42.480 --> 00:19:43.480]   Well, here's another number.
[00:19:43.480 --> 00:19:47.600]   Tim Cook, actually getting higher ratings from Apple employees as CEO than Steve Jobs
[00:19:47.600 --> 00:19:48.600]   did.
[00:19:48.600 --> 00:19:49.600]   I'm not actually.
[00:19:49.600 --> 00:19:51.560]   It doesn't put heads off.
[00:19:51.560 --> 00:19:52.560]   Yeah.
[00:19:52.560 --> 00:19:53.560]   Actually, you're right.
[00:19:53.560 --> 00:19:55.480]   You know, in fact, what's amazing.
[00:19:55.480 --> 00:20:00.680]   It's amazing that Steve Jobs had 95% approval rating because of the stories.
[00:20:00.680 --> 00:20:02.480]   Some of the stories Alex has told.
[00:20:02.480 --> 00:20:05.560]   I haven't told any stories or I'm sorry.
[00:20:05.560 --> 00:20:07.920]   Others have told you're right.
[00:20:07.920 --> 00:20:10.920]   You don't even even now after Steve's gone, you don't want to tell stories.
[00:20:10.920 --> 00:20:11.920]   I don't tell any stories.
[00:20:11.920 --> 00:20:12.920]   Wow.
[00:20:12.920 --> 00:20:13.920]   I don't.
[00:20:13.920 --> 00:20:14.920]   I don't.
[00:20:14.920 --> 00:20:15.920]   I don't.
[00:20:15.920 --> 00:20:16.920]   I don't know anything.
[00:20:16.920 --> 00:20:17.920]   I know nothing.
[00:20:17.920 --> 00:20:18.920]   In fact, I'm not even sure if I've ever been to the Apple campus.
[00:20:18.920 --> 00:20:19.920]   Yeah.
[00:20:19.920 --> 00:20:20.920]   I know nothing.
[00:20:20.920 --> 00:20:21.920]   That's pretty.
[00:20:21.920 --> 00:20:22.920]   Is it?
[00:20:22.920 --> 00:20:23.920]   Is it?
[00:20:23.920 --> 00:20:24.920]   Is it in Mountain View?
[00:20:24.920 --> 00:20:25.920]   Hasbro.
[00:20:25.920 --> 00:20:33.280]   It's prudent, I think, to say that because you see what happens to people who aren't.
[00:20:33.280 --> 00:20:35.320]   Don't toe the line.
[00:20:35.320 --> 00:20:39.840]   They don't get invitations to Apple events.
[00:20:39.840 --> 00:20:43.520]   Tim Cook, number one, Jim Turley of Ernst and Young, number two.
[00:20:43.520 --> 00:20:49.960]   Tim Cook has 97% approval from March 2011 to March 2012.
[00:20:49.960 --> 00:20:50.960]   That's amazing.
[00:20:50.960 --> 00:20:53.680]   American Express and Google, Larry Page at Google.
[00:20:53.680 --> 00:20:55.560]   Just to hair underneath.
[00:20:55.560 --> 00:21:02.240]   Again, those are, as Andy quite rightly points out, just numbers.
[00:21:02.240 --> 00:21:07.040]   I think that the thing is, is that I definitely think that Tim Cook's going to be a great,
[00:21:07.040 --> 00:21:08.920]   as far as taking care of the employees, taking care of the brands.
[00:21:08.920 --> 00:21:10.360]   I can see why the employees would love him.
[00:21:10.360 --> 00:21:13.400]   I think that the real question that we're not going to know for the next three to five
[00:21:13.400 --> 00:21:17.240]   years is will Apple continue to innovate at the speed that it's been innovating?
[00:21:17.240 --> 00:21:21.560]   Steve was not necessarily the soft, warm, you know, we're going to take care of everybody
[00:21:21.560 --> 00:21:25.920]   kind of guy, but he was able to push that innovation in a very, very specific and very
[00:21:25.920 --> 00:21:27.440]   laser pointed sort of way.
[00:21:27.440 --> 00:21:31.600]   And I just, I do get concerned that when I see the new interface for the Apple TV, I
[00:21:31.600 --> 00:21:34.840]   get concerned that Steve is gone now.
[00:21:34.840 --> 00:21:39.520]   So we didn't talk about that last week, but I didn't bring it up.
[00:21:39.520 --> 00:21:44.080]   But the guy who said, you know, the guy tweeted, oh God, that was something Steve Jobs rejected
[00:21:44.080 --> 00:21:45.080]   five years ago.
[00:21:45.080 --> 00:21:48.320]   We're talking about the tiled interface on the new Apple TV.
[00:21:48.320 --> 00:21:51.160]   He hated that five years ago, and then he recanted a little bit.
[00:21:51.160 --> 00:21:52.160]   He said, you know, I'm not an Apple.
[00:21:52.160 --> 00:21:56.680]   I've been an Apple in years, but I should point out that that was Steve five years ago.
[00:21:56.680 --> 00:21:59.880]   And it may very well be that now that we have everybody's used to the tiled interface
[00:21:59.880 --> 00:22:03.120]   of the iPhone and the iPad, that this would be, but I agree with you.
[00:22:03.120 --> 00:22:04.120]   I hate it.
[00:22:04.120 --> 00:22:07.920]   A lot of this, a lot of, I might be much rather go back.
[00:22:07.920 --> 00:22:14.160]   The other thing to that is that your lot of stories about how it wasn't always, you
[00:22:14.160 --> 00:22:16.560]   know, Steve gives you a yes or no and that the yes is everything.
[00:22:16.560 --> 00:22:17.560]   He hated everything.
[00:22:17.560 --> 00:22:18.560]   Yes.
[00:22:18.560 --> 00:22:21.920]   Well, no, it's just that sometimes, you know, because he didn't get it at that time or
[00:22:21.920 --> 00:22:25.280]   because they didn't really make the right case for it.
[00:22:25.280 --> 00:22:29.440]   Oftentimes it's not that you could talk Steve into a bit more like if you make your case
[00:22:29.440 --> 00:22:32.640]   better with success with work on it, you can make it work.
[00:22:32.640 --> 00:22:34.880]   So that's the fact that they've gone to a tiled interface.
[00:22:34.880 --> 00:22:39.120]   I don't think means that you're anyways turning their backs on Steve.
[00:22:39.120 --> 00:22:41.760]   And if they, you know, and if they were, you know, Steve's not here anymore.
[00:22:41.760 --> 00:22:42.760]   This is time for stuff.
[00:22:42.760 --> 00:22:45.240]   Well, do you like the new interface?
[00:22:45.240 --> 00:22:46.240]   I actually do.
[00:22:46.240 --> 00:22:50.440]   I think it's more appropriate for the sort of device that the Apple TV is.
[00:22:50.440 --> 00:22:56.560]   It's, it's, there's your entertainment is coming from so many different sources now that
[00:22:56.560 --> 00:23:01.120]   it's, it kind of defies organization in sort of a drop down menu where here is everything
[00:23:01.120 --> 00:23:02.640]   that you have that's related to the internet.
[00:23:02.640 --> 00:23:04.760]   Here's everything you have that's related to music.
[00:23:04.760 --> 00:23:08.800]   I think that the only way to really cut through that at this point is to simply say, fine,
[00:23:08.800 --> 00:23:11.040]   here's one tile that simply has local music.
[00:23:11.040 --> 00:23:13.240]   Here's another tile that has stuff that's coming from Netflix.
[00:23:13.240 --> 00:23:16.440]   Here's another tile that represents for Flickr's Flickr stream and other tile that represents
[00:23:16.440 --> 00:23:17.440]   YouTube.
[00:23:17.440 --> 00:23:21.160]   If there's a better way of doing that, especially a better way you can do that with a, with
[00:23:21.160 --> 00:23:26.600]   a five button interface or better yet a better way to get there with a voice interface where
[00:23:26.600 --> 00:23:32.080]   you don't want to be saying menu, right, internet, Flickr, when you, when you rather just simply
[00:23:32.080 --> 00:23:34.720]   look at a list and say, Oh, Flickr, give me Flickr.
[00:23:34.720 --> 00:23:36.200]   I think it's fine.
[00:23:36.200 --> 00:23:38.360]   Well, Adam, he says hard to, hard to compare.
[00:23:38.360 --> 00:23:42.360]   Well, yeah, that's, I mean, the problem is is that, you know, it's easy when, you know,
[00:23:42.360 --> 00:23:45.160]   my end comes out, we all have snow leopard max around to compare to.
[00:23:45.160 --> 00:23:47.800]   So you can actually go back and forth and say, ah, this is better.
[00:23:47.800 --> 00:23:49.760]   This is worse for these reasons.
[00:23:49.760 --> 00:23:53.040]   The Apple TV, I mean, I'm sure there are people who have multiple ones out there.
[00:23:53.040 --> 00:23:54.120]   I am not one of them.
[00:23:54.120 --> 00:23:58.240]   And so all of a sudden it changes and well, the old one I saw upgraded.
[00:23:58.240 --> 00:24:02.680]   So it's hard to tell because we, if you upgraded, yeah, precisely, they're all the same.
[00:24:02.680 --> 00:24:03.680]   That's exactly what I got.
[00:24:03.680 --> 00:24:04.680]   I'm probably there.
[00:24:04.680 --> 00:24:06.320]   My old one upgraded.
[00:24:06.320 --> 00:24:08.040]   Why do you, but we'll go ahead.
[00:24:08.040 --> 00:24:12.840]   My feeling is though that it's actually not more, more clicks that if you're, if you're
[00:24:12.840 --> 00:24:16.960]   just like going into Netflix every night, which is sort of mostly what we do, you know,
[00:24:16.960 --> 00:24:18.360]   it Netflix is selected.
[00:24:18.360 --> 00:24:22.040]   You go, you know, it's one click to get in there, one click to get to, you know, one
[00:24:22.040 --> 00:24:24.120]   or two clicks to get to recently watched boom, you're in.
[00:24:24.120 --> 00:24:30.480]   So I sort of don't quite like it, but I can't say that it's a less efficient interface,
[00:24:30.480 --> 00:24:32.040]   which is the main thing that I would worry about.
[00:24:32.040 --> 00:24:35.280]   I think if I could rearrange the tiles, I think I'd probably be less sensitive to it.
[00:24:35.280 --> 00:24:37.960]   You just always feel like, oh, that, because I don't use anything on the first seems like
[00:24:37.960 --> 00:24:40.720]   there's anything on that top line on top line.
[00:24:40.720 --> 00:24:41.720]   I don't.
[00:24:41.720 --> 00:24:44.960]   So I don't, so like I don't go to any of those and so I'm like, oh, you know, it's
[00:24:44.960 --> 00:24:46.120]   confusing as the iPhone.
[00:24:46.120 --> 00:24:47.600]   Well, it is kind of confusing.
[00:24:47.600 --> 00:24:48.600]   That's the other thing.
[00:24:48.600 --> 00:24:52.520]   It's kind of confusing because you can, you might see what you want on that top row, but
[00:24:52.520 --> 00:24:54.360]   then if you click it, it doesn't go to it.
[00:24:54.360 --> 00:24:57.640]   It goes to it's just, it's difficult for me.
[00:24:57.640 --> 00:24:59.600]   I am not a fan of it.
[00:24:59.600 --> 00:25:02.360]   And I'm using it a lot because I wanted to really kind of try it.
[00:25:02.360 --> 00:25:06.320]   I replaced my Roku with it just so I could really have an experience of it.
[00:25:06.320 --> 00:25:11.680]   The main thing that I don't like is the way it focuses all of the, that top row with the,
[00:25:11.680 --> 00:25:15.000]   like the, the, the, the, the, the trade, you know, the posters for the different movies
[00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:18.800]   with only the iTunes stuff that I don't use iTunes.
[00:25:18.800 --> 00:25:19.800]   I use Netflix.
[00:25:19.800 --> 00:25:23.240]   And so I like before when I could see the Netflix, you know, pictures up there.
[00:25:23.240 --> 00:25:24.240]   Right.
[00:25:24.240 --> 00:25:27.080]   Although I think the one it does do is that because I use Netflix a lot when I come up
[00:25:27.080 --> 00:25:28.880]   to it and I see movies that are available.
[00:25:28.880 --> 00:25:29.880]   I'm like, oh, those are available.
[00:25:29.880 --> 00:25:30.880]   And of course, I think that they're Netflix.
[00:25:30.880 --> 00:25:31.880]   I'm like, yeah.
[00:25:31.880 --> 00:25:33.200]   And then I, and then I could stuff.
[00:25:33.200 --> 00:25:34.200]   Wow.
[00:25:34.200 --> 00:25:35.200]   There's a current movie.
[00:25:35.200 --> 00:25:36.200]   Oh my God.
[00:25:36.200 --> 00:25:40.360]   I think that they're already in my queue because oftentimes, take your daily soles or spies
[00:25:40.360 --> 00:25:41.360]   on Netflix.
[00:25:41.360 --> 00:25:42.360]   Thank God.
[00:25:42.360 --> 00:25:43.360]   Yeah.
[00:25:43.360 --> 00:25:44.360]   Exactly.
[00:25:44.360 --> 00:25:45.360]   No, one, one, six dollars later.
[00:25:45.360 --> 00:25:46.360]   I like the way that Roku does it.
[00:25:46.360 --> 00:25:49.200]   I do like the fact that the top level, you have a carousel of here are the apps that are
[00:25:49.200 --> 00:25:50.760]   available to you on this.
[00:25:50.760 --> 00:25:52.000]   One of them is going to be Roku.
[00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:53.000]   One of them is going to be Netflix.
[00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:55.040]   One of them is going to be Amazon is some video.
[00:25:55.040 --> 00:25:57.520]   One of them is going to be stuff on the Twit network.
[00:25:57.520 --> 00:25:59.400]   I don't think there's a perfect solution to this.
[00:25:59.400 --> 00:26:04.360]   The only, I've used, I actually now have about three or four different TV boxes connected
[00:26:04.360 --> 00:26:06.720]   to the TV outside my office.
[00:26:06.720 --> 00:26:11.440]   I'm trying to figure out, I'm trying to get excited enough about Boxy and Google TV to
[00:26:11.440 --> 00:26:12.640]   write something about them.
[00:26:12.640 --> 00:26:17.360]   I've had them hooked up for months now and I just can't say anything that says, why
[00:26:17.360 --> 00:26:18.360]   would you actually want this?
[00:26:18.360 --> 00:26:19.360]   I'll tell you why.
[00:26:19.360 --> 00:26:23.920]   You want to see Boxy works nice, but it's just too much of a computer hooked up to the
[00:26:23.920 --> 00:26:24.920]   TV.
[00:26:24.920 --> 00:26:29.360]   So it's not designed like an appliance the way that the Apple TV or the Roku box should.
[00:26:29.360 --> 00:26:32.440]   So it's a really, really sensitive topic and I don't think anybody's really knocked it
[00:26:32.440 --> 00:26:33.440]   yet.
[00:26:33.440 --> 00:26:35.120]   I love Google TV.
[00:26:35.120 --> 00:26:36.840]   I've got an interesting situation.
[00:26:36.840 --> 00:26:40.440]   We have a new Panasonic Viera Plasma.
[00:26:40.440 --> 00:26:43.000]   So it's a smart TV with it can do Netflix and Amazon.
[00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:44.000]   So it works.
[00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:45.000]   And all that.
[00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:46.000]   Well, what's interesting is...
[00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:49.800]   It's a great TV, but I just don't like the way the TV manufacturers are implementing
[00:26:49.800 --> 00:26:50.800]   apps.
[00:26:50.800 --> 00:26:54.880]   Well, I hear that they've been pointed to myself.
[00:26:54.880 --> 00:26:56.240]   The apps are a little more confusing to use.
[00:26:56.240 --> 00:26:57.680]   The interfaces aren't as good.
[00:26:57.680 --> 00:27:03.440]   And it's notably when you go into Netflix on the TV, it doesn't cash very well.
[00:27:03.440 --> 00:27:06.400]   So you have to wait for it to load your TV.
[00:27:06.400 --> 00:27:12.840]   But the Apple TV, since the upgrade, will just freeze or stop working.
[00:27:12.840 --> 00:27:17.600]   And say, can't conflict Netflix, whereas if we're having network problems, whereas the
[00:27:17.600 --> 00:27:23.360]   Viera app, it will go black or the Pixel Freeze for a second or two, audio will continue
[00:27:23.360 --> 00:27:24.360]   and then it will pick up.
[00:27:24.360 --> 00:27:27.640]   It's much more robust, which is really frustrating.
[00:27:27.640 --> 00:27:30.600]   Since the upgrade for the Apple TV, it's just gone downhill that way.
[00:27:30.600 --> 00:27:34.680]   I'm wondering whether that's a buffer issue, where it's not in order to jump.
[00:27:34.680 --> 00:27:36.120]   It's definitely network having trouble.
[00:27:36.120 --> 00:27:40.560]   Well, but the network having trouble is not as big of a deal as the buffer, because if
[00:27:40.560 --> 00:27:44.880]   that long wait that you're waiting for for that video to come up, is it cashing a big
[00:27:44.880 --> 00:27:49.800]   chunk of that video into RAM or hard drive or whatever, some kind of state?
[00:27:49.800 --> 00:27:54.560]   Don't think so, because both of the Apple TV will just do its little spinner, but whereas
[00:27:54.560 --> 00:27:59.120]   the Viera will either just freeze for a second or two and then come back, or if it really
[00:27:59.120 --> 00:28:02.160]   has trouble, it'll say go black entirely and say rebuffering.
[00:28:02.160 --> 00:28:04.440]   It almost never does the go black and say rebuffering.
[00:28:04.440 --> 00:28:05.440]   Right, because...
[00:28:05.440 --> 00:28:06.440]   And the Apple TV...
[00:28:06.440 --> 00:28:09.840]   Because you're waiting longer at the beginning, what it's doing is it's creating a larger buffer
[00:28:09.840 --> 00:28:11.520]   at the very beginning, so it's creating...
[00:28:11.520 --> 00:28:13.400]   Don't think so.
[00:28:13.400 --> 00:28:19.880]   Because the Viera is slower to load the queues in Netflix, but it's no slower to start once
[00:28:19.880 --> 00:28:21.880]   you actually press play.
[00:28:21.880 --> 00:28:22.880]   Okay.
[00:28:22.880 --> 00:28:25.880]   I'm sorry.
[00:28:25.880 --> 00:28:27.880]   It's interesting because...
[00:28:27.880 --> 00:28:28.880]   It's interesting because...
[00:28:28.880 --> 00:28:29.880]   Well...
[00:28:29.880 --> 00:28:37.560]   We reviewed the Samsung Smart Apps, but everybody I've talked to who has the new Smart TVs,
[00:28:37.560 --> 00:28:40.760]   and it's because you're comparing it to Apple and these guys are new with this, and they
[00:28:40.760 --> 00:28:41.760]   just...
[00:28:41.760 --> 00:28:42.760]   There's all sorts...
[00:28:42.760 --> 00:28:44.240]   Yeah, you don't want your TV to hang.
[00:28:44.240 --> 00:28:46.680]   You don't want to be watching a show.
[00:28:46.680 --> 00:28:47.680]   You don't want to be...
[00:28:47.680 --> 00:28:49.400]   This happened to me constantly.
[00:28:49.400 --> 00:28:51.520]   Watching a show and says, "Oh, you got to re-log into Facebook."
[00:28:51.520 --> 00:28:52.920]   No, I don't really want to...
[00:28:52.920 --> 00:28:54.600]   I want to watch Game of Thrones.
[00:28:54.600 --> 00:28:56.080]   Can I defer this?
[00:28:56.080 --> 00:28:57.920]   And it's covering the screen.
[00:28:57.920 --> 00:28:58.920]   It's like, "No!"
[00:28:58.920 --> 00:29:02.760]   That was the problem I had with the Boxy Box.
[00:29:02.760 --> 00:29:07.560]   You can get the HBO Go app for it, but it actually runs through a web browser and there
[00:29:07.560 --> 00:29:08.800]   are intermediates.
[00:29:08.800 --> 00:29:11.760]   As you said, you just want to see the Ricky Gervais show.
[00:29:11.760 --> 00:29:15.240]   You just want to pick up a remote and start watching TV.
[00:29:15.240 --> 00:29:18.440]   Things that you would have absolutely no problem with if you were in front of a laptop, in
[00:29:18.440 --> 00:29:21.480]   front of your desktop, are just not acceptable with the TV.
[00:29:21.480 --> 00:29:23.840]   That's actually one of the main reasons I like the Google TV.
[00:29:23.840 --> 00:29:25.320]   I have the Logitech review.
[00:29:25.320 --> 00:29:29.360]   Once they updated the OOS, which they really needed to do, it's been great.
[00:29:29.360 --> 00:29:33.360]   One of the reasons is, admittedly, not everybody wants a keyboard.
[00:29:33.360 --> 00:29:36.280]   It has a remote control.
[00:29:36.280 --> 00:29:38.960]   But it's more like that laptop experience.
[00:29:38.960 --> 00:29:40.920]   There's a button that says, "Go back to live TV.
[00:29:40.920 --> 00:29:41.920]   You press it.
[00:29:41.920 --> 00:29:42.920]   That's it."
[00:29:42.920 --> 00:29:45.920]   There's a home button that goes right to the menus.
[00:29:45.920 --> 00:29:48.840]   The navigation is so much easier because now you have it.
[00:29:48.840 --> 00:29:51.640]   Do you use your iPhone or iPad with your Apple TV?
[00:29:51.640 --> 00:29:52.640]   I do.
[00:29:52.640 --> 00:29:54.600]   One of the things, I do love AirPlay.
[00:29:54.600 --> 00:29:56.600]   I think AirPlay is a controller.
[00:29:56.600 --> 00:29:57.600]   No, I don't.
[00:29:57.600 --> 00:29:59.600]   I should probably do that.
[00:29:59.600 --> 00:30:02.840]   See, that's maybe the problem is that the Apple remote is so constrained.
[00:30:02.840 --> 00:30:04.640]   No, you've got to give that up.
[00:30:04.640 --> 00:30:05.640]   That's only there if someone doesn't have an iPhone.
[00:30:05.640 --> 00:30:09.480]   If you have an iPhone, you get the remote for the iPhone and it's just like, then when
[00:30:09.480 --> 00:30:11.880]   you have to type in your passwords and stuff, you type it on the iPhone.
[00:30:11.880 --> 00:30:12.880]   It's much easier.
[00:30:12.880 --> 00:30:14.880]   You never have anything with the Apple remote.
[00:30:14.880 --> 00:30:15.880]   What?
[00:30:15.880 --> 00:30:20.080]   Panasonic has really one of those big honking remote with 75 keys on it.
[00:30:20.080 --> 00:30:24.200]   That makes it almost impossible to use actually far before the five button Apple remote.
[00:30:24.200 --> 00:30:27.000]   I think you really did hit on it though.
[00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:31.480]   The fact that we use AirPlay from an iPad or from an iPhone and when you get to use it
[00:30:31.480 --> 00:30:38.720]   from your laptop with 10.8, I really think that that's the answer to having a internet
[00:30:38.720 --> 00:30:43.720]   connected TV set because every place where I'm discovering new entertainment, it's always
[00:30:43.720 --> 00:30:46.520]   on a mobile device or on my laptop.
[00:30:46.520 --> 00:30:50.760]   I finally, this actually started to hit me when I was testing out the new version of
[00:30:50.760 --> 00:30:54.120]   the Apple TV as a matter of fact because I spent, I was spending lots and lots of time
[00:30:54.120 --> 00:30:59.240]   in the living room writing my reviews and just like playing with stuff on there.
[00:30:59.240 --> 00:31:03.280]   But just like in the 10 minutes of downtime where I'm on Twitter and someone recommends
[00:31:03.280 --> 00:31:06.880]   a video link, I'm on the new iPad with that.
[00:31:06.880 --> 00:31:07.880]   I was like, "Oh, wait a minute.
[00:31:07.880 --> 00:31:09.200]   I don't have to watch it on the iPad screen.
[00:31:09.200 --> 00:31:13.600]   I can now tap this one button and I can actually now watch it in full 1080."
[00:31:13.600 --> 00:31:16.680]   You're full-tending on this huge TV set or across my sofa.
[00:31:16.680 --> 00:31:20.680]   And that's when it hit me that this is exactly how I want this sort of a setup to work.
[00:31:20.680 --> 00:31:23.600]   I want to use Netflix, the Netflix app on my iPad.
[00:31:23.600 --> 00:31:26.680]   I want to use links I'm getting from Twitter and from Flipboard.
[00:31:26.680 --> 00:31:29.280]   Then I want to tap one button and then simply say, "You know what?
[00:31:29.280 --> 00:31:30.920]   I don't want to look at this in a poster stamp.
[00:31:30.920 --> 00:31:34.400]   I want to actually sit back for the device back somewhere and now actually watch it."
[00:31:34.400 --> 00:31:35.560]   That's the device that I'd pay for.
[00:31:35.560 --> 00:31:39.560]   This is where Apple really has of course a huge advantage is that ecosystem won't roll
[00:31:39.560 --> 00:31:40.560]   in.
[00:31:40.560 --> 00:31:43.480]   The other thing, by the way, is that you don't need infrareds.
[00:31:43.480 --> 00:31:44.800]   You don't have to point at it.
[00:31:44.800 --> 00:31:50.840]   So the thing is the remote, I can run my TV in my back house from my remote.
[00:31:50.840 --> 00:31:53.600]   The iPhone does work that I have the free.
[00:31:53.600 --> 00:32:01.200]   I have the file sap for the iPhone 2 and it sickens me every single time that changing
[00:32:01.200 --> 00:32:05.720]   channels on the iPhone where it has to communicate with a Wi-Fi base station downstairs then
[00:32:05.720 --> 00:32:10.480]   back upstairs, then back to the cable box is faster and more interactive than actually
[00:32:10.480 --> 00:32:13.360]   holding up a remote and pointing and clicking my button that way.
[00:32:13.360 --> 00:32:14.360]   That's a very good point.
[00:32:14.360 --> 00:32:16.400]   Wi-Fi is the right way to go on that.
[00:32:16.400 --> 00:32:17.400]   We're going to take a break.
[00:32:17.400 --> 00:32:20.120]   We are having fun and we have more Mac news.
[00:32:20.120 --> 00:32:22.200]   Well, I shouldn't say Mac news.
[00:32:22.200 --> 00:32:25.120]   We might have some Mac news.
[00:32:25.120 --> 00:32:26.920]   I'm waiting for Mac news.
[00:32:26.920 --> 00:32:28.440]   Any minute now they'll be Mac news.
[00:32:28.440 --> 00:32:31.120]   Someone needs to create some Mac news.
[00:32:31.120 --> 00:32:32.600]   There's one story.
[00:32:32.600 --> 00:32:35.480]   There's one story on Mac break.
[00:32:35.480 --> 00:32:37.440]   Wait, yeah, I put a hardware section.
[00:32:37.440 --> 00:32:38.440]   You know it blows me away.
[00:32:38.440 --> 00:32:43.160]   When you started Mac break, when was that?
[00:32:43.160 --> 00:32:44.160]   2008, 2007?
[00:32:44.160 --> 00:32:46.240]   2007 I think.
[00:32:46.240 --> 00:32:52.480]   So five years ago and you went out and you spent, I went 100 grand on a 1080p camera.
[00:32:52.480 --> 00:32:54.880]   And then one thing, one of me, from Lucas.
[00:32:54.880 --> 00:32:57.080]   We did pay that off by the way.
[00:32:57.080 --> 00:32:58.080]   Well, good.
[00:32:58.080 --> 00:32:59.080]   I'm glad you paid it off.
[00:32:59.080 --> 00:33:00.480]   I mean, it's often worked.
[00:33:00.480 --> 00:33:02.080]   So he could shoot 1080p video.
[00:33:02.080 --> 00:33:03.480]   We put out this podcast.
[00:33:03.480 --> 00:33:04.920]   Nobody, everybody thought we were nuts.
[00:33:04.920 --> 00:33:06.320]   You were nuts, not me.
[00:33:06.320 --> 00:33:07.560]   Putting out a podcast in 1080p.
[00:33:07.560 --> 00:33:08.560]   Nobody could watch it.
[00:33:08.560 --> 00:33:09.560]   Nobody could download it.
[00:33:09.560 --> 00:33:10.560]   It was just nuts.
[00:33:10.560 --> 00:33:14.680]   And now, you know, I was thinking yesterday while I was doing the iPhone repair, I was
[00:33:14.680 --> 00:33:17.560]   using my Galaxy Note to shoot 1080p video.
[00:33:17.560 --> 00:33:22.840]   Well, it's not exactly the same as that Cinney Ulta, but it's still, it's 1080p video, hi
[00:33:22.840 --> 00:33:27.680]   deaf video and uploading it while they're doing it to the cloud so that everybody can
[00:33:27.680 --> 00:33:30.160]   watch it on my Twitter feed.
[00:33:30.160 --> 00:33:31.400]   We've come a long way.
[00:33:31.400 --> 00:33:32.400]   Five years.
[00:33:32.400 --> 00:33:33.400]   Five years.
[00:33:33.400 --> 00:33:39.400]   It's like, now admittedly, the 1080p you were putting out was like true, hi deaf.
[00:33:39.400 --> 00:33:41.920]   But I mean, still, I mean, it's pretty good.
[00:33:41.920 --> 00:33:45.960]   You know, it's really hard to, it's kind of amazing in five years.
[00:33:45.960 --> 00:33:46.960]   And that's why-
[00:33:46.960 --> 00:33:47.960]   You think I should have saved?
[00:33:47.960 --> 00:33:48.960]   Yes.
[00:33:48.960 --> 00:33:51.600]   Well, that's why I'm not spending a lot of money on cameras because-
[00:33:51.600 --> 00:33:54.280]   We've actually stopped after that purchase.
[00:33:54.280 --> 00:33:56.440]   We stopped really spending a lot on cameras.
[00:33:56.440 --> 00:34:00.200]   We buy a lot of cameras, but we don't spend, if we're going to do more than $10,000, we
[00:34:00.200 --> 00:34:01.200]   typically rent.
[00:34:01.200 --> 00:34:02.200]   Yeah.
[00:34:02.200 --> 00:34:04.400]   I don't need those kinds of cameras very often.
[00:34:04.400 --> 00:34:05.400]   Yeah.
[00:34:05.400 --> 00:34:06.800]   So-
[00:34:06.800 --> 00:34:09.000]   We will come back with more in just a bit.
[00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:13.880]   A great panel from Tidbits, Adam Anxt, Alex Lindsey of Pixel Core from Chicago Sun
[00:34:13.880 --> 00:34:15.680]   Times, Andy Anaco.
[00:34:15.680 --> 00:34:18.640]   Let's talk about Pond Five.
[00:34:18.640 --> 00:34:24.040]   There are a lot of stock content.
[00:34:24.040 --> 00:34:26.280]   I don't, I don't even want to say stock photos anymore.
[00:34:26.280 --> 00:34:29.720]   Stock content, stock media marketplaces out there.
[00:34:29.720 --> 00:34:31.240]   This is the one you should be looking at.
[00:34:31.240 --> 00:34:32.920]   And you may not have heard of it.
[00:34:32.920 --> 00:34:34.880]   I hadn't until they came to us.
[00:34:34.880 --> 00:34:36.200]   This is really amazing.
[00:34:36.200 --> 00:34:38.160]   First of all, very affordable.
[00:34:38.160 --> 00:34:39.760]   It's great for creators.
[00:34:39.760 --> 00:34:41.360]   I think that's one of the reasons I like it.
[00:34:41.360 --> 00:34:47.000]   Creators can use Pond Five and set their own price, which is not normally the case.
[00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:51.480]   But it has not just video, but not just pictures, but video.
[00:34:51.480 --> 00:34:54.240]   See this beautiful video that's showing right now.
[00:34:54.240 --> 00:34:55.760]   They have a free one every day, by the way.
[00:34:55.760 --> 00:34:59.760]   So you should always check Pond Five to get your free stock video every week.
[00:34:59.760 --> 00:35:00.760]   That's the squirrel.
[00:35:00.760 --> 00:35:02.480]   They're going to use that squirrel.
[00:35:02.480 --> 00:35:03.480]   That's a good squirrel.
[00:35:03.480 --> 00:35:04.720]   Andy's got a few of those.
[00:35:04.720 --> 00:35:07.200]   Andy, you could probably sell your squirrel videos on Pond Five.
[00:35:07.200 --> 00:35:09.160]   Come to think of it.
[00:35:09.160 --> 00:35:11.720]   This is the free clip of the week.
[00:35:11.720 --> 00:35:13.400]   You need us to be tax deductible now.
[00:35:13.400 --> 00:35:15.600]   This is, yeah, exactly.
[00:35:15.600 --> 00:35:17.360]   And this is a HD 720.
[00:35:17.360 --> 00:35:18.360]   Look at that.
[00:35:18.360 --> 00:35:19.360]   Kind of an airport.
[00:35:19.360 --> 00:35:20.360]   This would be useful.
[00:35:20.360 --> 00:35:24.840]   But that's the point is that there are so many choices here.
[00:35:24.840 --> 00:35:29.800]   Video, photos, illustrations, music tracks, sound effects, after effects projects.
[00:35:29.800 --> 00:35:35.200]   If I go to the front page and you'll see a million video clips, 5,000 plus new ones
[00:35:35.200 --> 00:35:37.200]   this week alone.
[00:35:37.200 --> 00:35:38.200]   Seven points here.
[00:35:38.200 --> 00:35:39.200]   How do they curate them?
[00:35:39.200 --> 00:35:41.200]   Do they, I don't know, are they going through all of that?
[00:35:41.200 --> 00:35:44.360]   Oh, is that where you got the lion the other time?
[00:35:44.360 --> 00:35:50.760]   I was going to say I got all my lion sound effects, the awesome ones from last week.
[00:35:50.760 --> 00:35:52.760]   That's good.
[00:35:52.760 --> 00:35:56.200]   And there's so many to choose from.
[00:35:56.200 --> 00:35:57.480]   And then there's also video.
[00:35:57.480 --> 00:35:59.080]   So yeah, I could do a slate.
[00:35:59.080 --> 00:36:02.280]   I can create a slate for your, you know, Andy's lion tip.
[00:36:02.280 --> 00:36:05.680]   212,000 audio clips.
[00:36:05.680 --> 00:36:07.160]   And there's new all the time.
[00:36:07.160 --> 00:36:08.160]   So this is Pond Five.
[00:36:08.160 --> 00:36:09.960]   I just want you to kind of know about it.
[00:36:09.960 --> 00:36:17.120]   And by the way, we have a 25% off deal if you use offer code TWIT25 at Pond Five dot com.
[00:36:17.120 --> 00:36:18.840]   So it's a hummingbird in front of green screen.
[00:36:18.840 --> 00:36:20.600]   Yeah, see these, I mean, look at that.
[00:36:20.600 --> 00:36:21.600]   That's beautiful.
[00:36:21.600 --> 00:36:23.400]   Rain on glass.
[00:36:23.400 --> 00:36:25.120]   I mean, that's gorgeous.
[00:36:25.120 --> 00:36:27.960]   So use them in your PowerPoint or keynote presentations.
[00:36:27.960 --> 00:36:30.160]   Use them in your podcasts.
[00:36:30.160 --> 00:36:32.880]   Very affordable prices started $5 for stock video and music.
[00:36:32.880 --> 00:36:34.480]   $2 for sound effects.
[00:36:34.480 --> 00:36:35.960]   What they call royalty free.
[00:36:35.960 --> 00:36:36.960]   Once you pay, you just use it.
[00:36:36.960 --> 00:36:38.360]   Well, and that's so important.
[00:36:38.360 --> 00:36:42.520]   Once you start doing this for business and we do a lot of, we get a lot of stock photography
[00:36:42.520 --> 00:36:45.840]   is that you have to pay attention to your rights, you know, make sure that you're not
[00:36:45.840 --> 00:36:47.840]   just pulling something down off the internet.
[00:36:47.840 --> 00:36:50.720]   And so finding some royalty free means you're not paying for it every time you use it.
[00:36:50.720 --> 00:36:53.000]   You're not paying for it every time it goes out and you have that video you can put into
[00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:56.240]   your video or your presentation and you're not worried about it.
[00:36:56.240 --> 00:36:58.880]   You are totally taken care of from a legal perspective.
[00:36:58.880 --> 00:36:59.880]   Great UI to you.
[00:36:59.880 --> 00:37:03.160]   You just hover over the thumbnail and it'll actually play the video for you so you can
[00:37:03.160 --> 00:37:04.400]   see what you're going to get.
[00:37:04.400 --> 00:37:10.320]   This is 1080P time lapse of clouds, shadow passing of village in the Georgian mountains.
[00:37:10.320 --> 00:37:11.320]   Five bucks.
[00:37:11.320 --> 00:37:12.720]   Oh, no, I'm sorry.
[00:37:12.720 --> 00:37:13.880]   This was $29.
[00:37:13.880 --> 00:37:17.160]   So the prices are set by the creator, which is great.
[00:37:17.160 --> 00:37:20.680]   There's a cable way in the, I guess somebody in the Georgian mountains is doing a lot
[00:37:20.680 --> 00:37:21.680]   of video.
[00:37:21.680 --> 00:37:22.680]   They're really good.
[00:37:22.680 --> 00:37:23.680]   They're very affordable.
[00:37:23.680 --> 00:37:24.680]   It's a really neat thing.
[00:37:24.680 --> 00:37:26.640]   And you could take 25% off your first order.
[00:37:26.640 --> 00:37:31.440]   Actually, I didn't even say that just this month by using the Africa to a 25 when you
[00:37:31.440 --> 00:37:36.560]   check out audio of a ticking bomb or a music background for your next viral video images
[00:37:36.560 --> 00:37:38.480]   of palm trees, penguins and pandas.
[00:37:38.480 --> 00:37:42.760]   Nowadays, you know, you just have to breathe on a video and it'll get pulled from YouTube.
[00:37:42.760 --> 00:37:43.760]   Lion feasting.
[00:37:43.760 --> 00:37:44.760]   Lion feasting.
[00:37:44.760 --> 00:37:45.760]   Mmm.
[00:37:45.760 --> 00:37:46.760]   Yummy.

[00:38:15.200 --> 00:38:20.240]   Half of American households owned at least one Apple product according to a CNBC survey.
[00:38:20.240 --> 00:38:22.080]   Holy penetration Batman.
[00:38:22.080 --> 00:38:23.760]   Okay, I gave it.
[00:38:23.760 --> 00:38:29.680]   I said that just so that you could just so that you could say that we're moving on.
[00:38:29.680 --> 00:38:31.000]   That was very nicely done.
[00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:32.000]   I must say.
[00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:33.000]   Well played, sir.
[00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:34.000]   Thank you.
[00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:35.000]   Thank you very much.
[00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:40.200]   Oh, now why does Google want my password?
[00:38:40.200 --> 00:38:44.920]   I've been sitting on this Google document all day and now all of a sudden, by the way,
[00:38:44.920 --> 00:38:45.920]   are you?
[00:38:45.920 --> 00:38:46.920]   It's actually a flashback virus.
[00:38:46.920 --> 00:38:48.920]   Oh, I hope not.
[00:38:48.920 --> 00:38:52.280]   Now you scared me.
[00:38:52.280 --> 00:38:55.280]   All right.
[00:38:55.280 --> 00:38:56.280]   Signing in.
[00:38:56.280 --> 00:38:57.960]   Thank you.
[00:38:57.960 --> 00:39:05.560]   Let's move on to a very good stock market price for Apple.
[00:39:05.560 --> 00:39:12.080]   Analysts are now saying that Apple may get to $1,000 a share in a market cap of a trillion
[00:39:12.080 --> 00:39:13.080]   dollars.
[00:39:13.080 --> 00:39:14.560]   Someone's going to do that in a dollar.
[00:39:14.560 --> 00:39:19.560]   I'll say that you have one share of Apple stock or a MacBook Air.
[00:39:19.560 --> 00:39:20.560]   God.
[00:39:20.560 --> 00:39:26.360]   Yeah, right now it's a well-equipped iPad.
[00:39:26.360 --> 00:39:33.200]   Apples, of course, financial results will come out April 24th, a Tuesday right after
[00:39:33.200 --> 00:39:35.840]   Mac break weekly, as always.
[00:39:35.840 --> 00:39:36.840]   Thanks.
[00:39:36.840 --> 00:39:38.280]   No, they do it up for me.
[00:39:38.280 --> 00:39:39.280]   I know.
[00:39:39.280 --> 00:39:40.920]   You know, this is why you don't want to say that.
[00:39:40.920 --> 00:39:42.920]   They'll just screw it in every way they can.
[00:39:42.920 --> 00:39:44.800]   You're just going to move everything through.
[00:39:44.800 --> 00:39:47.120]   Our analysts call really should be right after Mac break weekly.
[00:39:47.120 --> 00:39:48.120]   Why would they do that?
[00:39:48.120 --> 00:39:53.240]   The same reason they released us after updates on Monday afternoons, just to mess with us.
[00:39:53.240 --> 00:39:54.240]   Just to mess with you.
[00:39:54.240 --> 00:39:55.560]   It's clearly why.
[00:39:55.560 --> 00:39:57.320]   It's clearly because it's us.
[00:39:57.320 --> 00:39:59.280]   How can we screw tidbits?
[00:39:59.280 --> 00:40:01.240]   Yes.
[00:40:01.240 --> 00:40:03.240]   They will do live streaming of the call, which is fun.
[00:40:03.240 --> 00:40:04.240]   Maybe we'll break in.
[00:40:04.240 --> 00:40:05.960]   What are we doing on that?
[00:40:05.960 --> 00:40:09.960]   We'll break into Twitter photo at two o'clock and say, "I'm sorry, we're going to have to
[00:40:09.960 --> 00:40:13.600]   suspend Twitter photo while we listen to Tim Cook."
[00:40:13.600 --> 00:40:16.280]   You know it's going to be a good quarter.
[00:40:16.280 --> 00:40:20.200]   You know it's their first iPad 3/4, right?
[00:40:20.200 --> 00:40:23.720]   We installed yet another press to print more money.
[00:40:23.720 --> 00:40:24.720]   Yes.
[00:40:24.720 --> 00:40:26.840]   It is fully operational.
[00:40:26.840 --> 00:40:31.000]   Their last quarter was their best quarter ever, $13 billion in profits.
[00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:37.120]   It's going to be an architectural update on the money pits underneath the new headquarters.
[00:40:37.120 --> 00:40:38.600]   Do you want to, does anybody want to predict?
[00:40:38.600 --> 00:40:45.040]   I mean it's three weeks off, but anybody want to predict iPad sales for that first quarter?
[00:40:45.040 --> 00:40:49.240]   We were wrong, wrong, wrong on iPad sales for the first week.
[00:40:49.240 --> 00:40:50.240]   We admit it now.
[00:40:50.240 --> 00:40:51.240]   You said...
[00:40:51.240 --> 00:40:53.840]   I thought it was the year.
[00:40:53.840 --> 00:40:56.880]   No, no, we were doing the first weekend of iPad sales.
[00:40:56.880 --> 00:40:57.880]   What are we saying?
[00:40:57.880 --> 00:40:58.880]   I said...
[00:40:58.880 --> 00:40:59.880]   I think he said 15 million.
[00:40:59.880 --> 00:41:01.600]   I said 15 million for the first week.
[00:41:01.600 --> 00:41:02.600]   It was like...
[00:41:02.600 --> 00:41:03.600]   Oh, yes, sure.
[00:41:03.600 --> 00:41:04.600]   Now he says that.
[00:41:04.600 --> 00:41:05.600]   I think it's working.
[00:41:05.600 --> 00:41:07.600]   We were saying very clear.
[00:41:07.600 --> 00:41:11.240]   We weren't we Andy very clear, first weekend of sales.
[00:41:11.240 --> 00:41:13.160]   I didn't say 15 million.
[00:41:13.160 --> 00:41:14.840]   You thought it was the first week?
[00:41:14.840 --> 00:41:15.840]   You thought it was the first week?
[00:41:15.840 --> 00:41:16.840]   I thought it was the first week.
[00:41:16.840 --> 00:41:18.520]   Oh, I could be wrong.
[00:41:18.520 --> 00:41:23.840]   But even Andy, who was the most conservative, still probably overestimated.
[00:41:23.840 --> 00:41:25.600]   What do you think for the first quarter?
[00:41:25.600 --> 00:41:28.640]   So, still have had...
[00:41:28.640 --> 00:41:29.640]   Not very long.
[00:41:29.640 --> 00:41:30.640]   Yeah.
[00:41:30.640 --> 00:41:33.480]   I'd be surprised if it...
[00:41:33.480 --> 00:41:35.280]   It's probably going to be pretty damn good.
[00:41:35.280 --> 00:41:36.280]   Yeah.
[00:41:36.280 --> 00:41:37.280]   Good.
[00:41:37.280 --> 00:41:38.280]   We have a winner.
[00:41:38.280 --> 00:41:39.280]   How many?
[00:41:39.280 --> 00:41:40.280]   12 million.
[00:41:40.280 --> 00:41:41.280]   12 million.
[00:41:41.280 --> 00:41:44.560]   They did 15 in last quarter and that was record.
[00:41:44.560 --> 00:41:46.280]   15 in a quarter.
[00:41:46.280 --> 00:41:47.280]   I would say...
[00:41:47.280 --> 00:41:48.280]   That was full quarter.
[00:41:48.280 --> 00:41:49.280]   That was full quarter.
[00:41:49.280 --> 00:41:50.280]   We're talking...
[00:41:50.280 --> 00:41:54.160]   Do you think they sold many iPad 2s in the last quarter?
[00:41:54.160 --> 00:41:55.160]   Maybe they did.
[00:41:55.160 --> 00:41:57.160]   Well, they're still selling a cheap one.
[00:41:57.160 --> 00:41:58.160]   Yeah.
[00:41:58.160 --> 00:41:59.160]   And the cheap one.
[00:41:59.160 --> 00:42:02.120]   I'd be interested to see if they break out the iPad 2 and say how many are buying...
[00:42:02.120 --> 00:42:03.120]   Maybe they won.
[00:42:03.120 --> 00:42:04.120]   ...the ones of one.
[00:42:04.120 --> 00:42:05.120]   I don't think they won too.
[00:42:05.120 --> 00:42:06.120]   But I...
[00:42:06.120 --> 00:42:07.120]   I think that would be really interesting because I'm kind of curious what...
[00:42:07.120 --> 00:42:08.960]   Who that opened up.
[00:42:08.960 --> 00:42:09.960]   There is.
[00:42:09.960 --> 00:42:12.160]   And it baffles me every time I hear it.
[00:42:12.160 --> 00:42:17.760]   I often heard, "Oh, the iPad 3 is just kind of marginally better."
[00:42:17.760 --> 00:42:19.360]   It is from the iPad 2?
[00:42:19.360 --> 00:42:20.360]   Yeah.
[00:42:20.360 --> 00:42:21.360]   It is just marginally...
[00:42:21.360 --> 00:42:22.360]   It's $100 better.
[00:42:22.360 --> 00:42:23.360]   It's marginally more expensive.
[00:42:23.360 --> 00:42:24.360]   It's marginally more expensive.
[00:42:24.360 --> 00:42:26.360]   It makes it much more than marginally better.
[00:42:26.360 --> 00:42:30.960]   I think the fact that you can get 40 megabits per second on the FON the LTE model...
[00:42:30.960 --> 00:42:31.960]   That's...
[00:42:31.960 --> 00:42:36.920]   And the fact that you can get a display quality that is as good or better than your
[00:42:36.920 --> 00:42:38.800]   desktop, that's not a marginal one.
[00:42:38.800 --> 00:42:39.800]   And a decent...
[00:42:39.800 --> 00:42:43.600]   And an actually very usable camera.
[00:42:43.600 --> 00:42:46.440]   To all of that means it's more than a marginal...
[00:42:46.440 --> 00:42:50.200]   But anyway, apparently there's enough people who believe that that they might say, "Oh,
[00:42:50.200 --> 00:42:51.840]   I'll get the iPad 2 for 100 less."
[00:42:51.840 --> 00:42:52.840]   Yeah.
[00:42:52.840 --> 00:42:54.200]   And I will say it for $100 less.
[00:42:54.200 --> 00:42:56.720]   It's marginally better, but it's only marginally more expensive.
[00:42:56.720 --> 00:42:57.920]   You think it's $100 more?
[00:42:57.920 --> 00:42:59.160]   Absolutely get the iPad 3.
[00:42:59.160 --> 00:43:00.640]   I mean, that's what I'm just saying.
[00:43:00.640 --> 00:43:01.640]   I mean, it's not...
[00:43:01.640 --> 00:43:02.640]   You're not.
[00:43:02.640 --> 00:43:05.120]   There are certainly a lot of people who are purely budget constraint.
[00:43:05.120 --> 00:43:06.120]   You know what I mean?
[00:43:06.120 --> 00:43:07.120]   Sure.
[00:43:07.120 --> 00:43:10.360]   I don't necessarily defend it, but there are other people who say, "Okay, if it's $100
[00:43:10.360 --> 00:43:13.480]   cheaper, I'll get the $100 cheaper one because that's what I can afford."
[00:43:13.480 --> 00:43:15.200]   Well, and also the departments.
[00:43:15.200 --> 00:43:20.080]   There are other departments who can say, "I'm going to get two free iPads if I get the iPad
[00:43:20.080 --> 00:43:24.760]   2 with the amount of money that I have to spend to equip my department or my class for
[00:43:24.760 --> 00:43:25.760]   iPad.
[00:43:25.760 --> 00:43:26.760]   Yeah.
[00:43:26.760 --> 00:43:29.040]   I definitely think that if I'm buying a huge number of them, I think that the $399 makes
[00:43:29.040 --> 00:43:31.280]   a big difference because it does add up pretty quickly.
[00:43:31.280 --> 00:43:35.120]   And especially we use iPads a lot when we have producers that are all working on the
[00:43:35.120 --> 00:43:37.000]   same project at the same time on a live stream.
[00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:38.000]   We're using these coasters.
[00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:39.000]   Yeah.
[00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:40.000]   No, we need Skype.
[00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:43.160]   We need like just to be able to sit there and chat back and forth with people all over
[00:43:43.160 --> 00:43:45.120]   the world at the same time.
[00:43:45.120 --> 00:43:47.760]   And I don't need it to be, you know, 1080p to do that.
[00:43:47.760 --> 00:43:51.600]   And I'm seeing a big shift in fleet use of iPads.
[00:43:51.600 --> 00:43:52.600]   Yeah.
[00:43:52.600 --> 00:43:53.600]   It'd be...
[00:43:53.600 --> 00:43:56.880]   And it's more and more companies I'm hearing from and talking to who are just saying,
[00:43:56.880 --> 00:44:00.520]   "We're just going to give every single one of our associates and our field people an
[00:44:00.520 --> 00:44:02.480]   iPad and say, "Do whatever you want to do with it.
[00:44:02.480 --> 00:44:07.280]   This is going to save us more than $500 a year just in not having to send you paper
[00:44:07.280 --> 00:44:10.000]   documents and send you binders of training materials."
[00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:11.760]   I just keep seeing it over.
[00:44:11.760 --> 00:44:15.640]   Even if you just go to like a Home Depot, you will see more people who are like the company
[00:44:15.640 --> 00:44:20.360]   reps who are just there to like check on stock and make sure that the end caps are fully
[00:44:20.360 --> 00:44:21.360]   populated.
[00:44:21.360 --> 00:44:23.680]   They're getting all their stuff on an iPad now.
[00:44:23.680 --> 00:44:28.960]   I was walking through Macy's and the makeup counter and iPad demonstrate looks.
[00:44:28.960 --> 00:44:30.960]   You know, I mean, they're everywhere.
[00:44:30.960 --> 00:44:31.960]   Yeah.
[00:44:31.960 --> 00:44:34.560]   And I'm a member of them used in business in a variety of ways.
[00:44:34.560 --> 00:44:35.560]   Why?
[00:44:35.560 --> 00:44:36.560]   And I'm still...
[00:44:36.560 --> 00:44:41.560]   And in a business, I'm sure a business, you know, the Lancome counter sees a $500 iPad
[00:44:41.560 --> 00:44:44.720]   as a tiny amount for a display like that.
[00:44:44.720 --> 00:44:45.720]   There's nothing.
[00:44:45.720 --> 00:44:48.360]   And to have an interactive display, people used to pay a lot for kiosks.
[00:44:48.360 --> 00:44:49.880]   I used to do development for that.
[00:44:49.880 --> 00:44:50.880]   And it was like...
[00:44:50.880 --> 00:44:51.880]   You're right.
[00:44:51.880 --> 00:44:52.880]   It's a kiosk, isn't it?
[00:44:52.880 --> 00:44:56.120]   And with iBook author and so on and so forth, it's a really easy to develop, you know,
[00:44:56.120 --> 00:44:57.120]   kiosks.
[00:44:57.120 --> 00:44:58.120]   You know, I think that's the other piece of that.
[00:44:58.120 --> 00:45:00.680]   And I still think that's going to end up being a Trojan horse into corporate, not an
[00:45:00.680 --> 00:45:01.680]   education.
[00:45:01.680 --> 00:45:04.840]   It's going to be a really fun, but I think corporate training and corporate communication,
[00:45:04.840 --> 00:45:07.360]   I think is going to be a big seller for being...
[00:45:07.360 --> 00:45:10.320]   Anybody can create that kind of content for their company.
[00:45:10.320 --> 00:45:18.600]   So Foxconn decided to cut down the amount of overtime for its employees in China from...
[00:45:18.600 --> 00:45:21.360]   It was like 60 hours a month to 39 hours a month.
[00:45:21.360 --> 00:45:26.200]   And as one might predict, to be, you know, to be good, to be in compliance with Chinese
[00:45:26.200 --> 00:45:30.280]   laws, as well as Apple's requests, and as one might predict, the employees hit the roof.
[00:45:30.280 --> 00:45:32.000]   And he said, "We want the money!
[00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:33.600]   What are you taking our hours away for?"
[00:45:33.600 --> 00:45:35.160]   They said, "No, no, we'll still give you the same amount of..."
[00:45:35.160 --> 00:45:36.880]   No, we're here to work.
[00:45:36.880 --> 00:45:37.880]   We are not here to play.
[00:45:37.880 --> 00:45:39.440]   We're sending money back home.
[00:45:39.440 --> 00:45:45.320]   We want to work long hours just underscoring how difficult it is to really make from here
[00:45:45.320 --> 00:45:48.320]   an assessment of what the labor practices ought to be in China.
[00:45:48.320 --> 00:45:54.160]   However, the Fair Labor Association did today publish the findings of its investigation
[00:45:54.160 --> 00:45:56.920]   at Apple Foxconn.
[00:45:56.920 --> 00:46:01.000]   And here, they did audits of three Foxconn facilities.
[00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:05.200]   FLA's investigation found that within the last 12 months, all three factories exceeded
[00:46:05.200 --> 00:46:10.560]   both the FLA code standard of 60 hours per week regular plus overtime, and the Chinese
[00:46:10.560 --> 00:46:15.600]   legal limits of 40 hours per week and 36 maximum a month.
[00:46:15.600 --> 00:46:19.800]   Foxconn was making them work more overtime than was allowed even in China.
[00:46:19.800 --> 00:46:25.280]   During peak production periods, the average number of hours worked per week exceeded 60
[00:46:25.280 --> 00:46:34.120]   hours per worker per week during their ramping up for the iPhone 4s or whatever.
[00:46:34.120 --> 00:46:37.320]   There were periods in which some employees worked more than seven days in a row without
[00:46:37.320 --> 00:46:39.800]   the required 24 hours off.
[00:46:39.800 --> 00:46:41.720]   Sounds like Microsoft.
[00:46:41.720 --> 00:46:42.720]   Sounds like Twit.
[00:46:42.720 --> 00:46:43.720]   Sounds like me.
[00:46:43.720 --> 00:46:44.720]   I don't know.
[00:46:44.720 --> 00:46:49.760]   I'm not sure if there's been a week that I haven't worked 60 or 70 hours for...
[00:46:49.760 --> 00:46:53.240]   But I understand you don't want to require employees.
[00:46:53.240 --> 00:46:54.800]   I think it's nice to make it available.
[00:46:54.800 --> 00:46:56.000]   You don't want to require an employee.
[00:46:56.000 --> 00:46:57.000]   You cannot have an employee.
[00:46:57.000 --> 00:47:00.280]   They're not required because the employees are all upset that they're taking away.
[00:47:00.280 --> 00:47:04.040]   And again, we don't know if all the employees are upset or just some vocal ones or ones
[00:47:04.040 --> 00:47:06.000]   they were pushed forward by Foxconn.
[00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:11.240]   So I have an interesting thing that I just ran across today, which is that some students
[00:47:11.240 --> 00:47:17.320]   at Cornell are having a protest as we speak, in theory, streaking across campus to protest
[00:47:17.320 --> 00:47:23.360]   the fact that Cornell is associated with the Fair Labor Association for Cornell branded
[00:47:23.360 --> 00:47:25.080]   apparel.
[00:47:25.080 --> 00:47:30.560]   And apparently the Fair Labor Association has a number of policies that Cornell is actually
[00:47:30.560 --> 00:47:31.560]   considered...
[00:47:31.560 --> 00:47:33.560]   Considers problematic.
[00:47:33.560 --> 00:47:37.920]   And so the students are protesting to push Cornell into actually disassociating themselves
[00:47:37.920 --> 00:47:39.600]   with the FLA entirely.
[00:47:39.600 --> 00:47:41.960]   The FLA is by some scene as a shill.
[00:47:41.960 --> 00:47:42.960]   That's what you're saying.
[00:47:42.960 --> 00:47:43.960]   Yeah, that was the end.
[00:47:43.960 --> 00:47:46.760]   I think it was some independent group workers.
[00:47:46.760 --> 00:47:47.760]   I can't remember.
[00:47:47.760 --> 00:47:53.400]   I have to look at WCR, some group that was entirely independent of big corporations that
[00:47:53.400 --> 00:47:56.960]   the students were saying, "This is who you should be getting to be auditing your workers."
[00:47:56.960 --> 00:47:58.960]   Right.
[00:47:58.960 --> 00:48:06.800]   Foxconn has committed to reduce working hours to legal limits, which would be 40 hours
[00:48:06.800 --> 00:48:13.000]   a week and 36 maximum over time per month, while protecting pay, improving health and
[00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:17.240]   safety conditions, establishing a genuine voice for workers, and will monitor on an ongoing
[00:48:17.240 --> 00:48:20.040]   basis to verify compliance.
[00:48:20.040 --> 00:48:24.520]   Maximum of a 49-hour work week, including overtime, a decrease in a monthly overtime
[00:48:24.520 --> 00:48:27.240]   from 80 hours to 36 hours.
[00:48:27.240 --> 00:48:28.680]   I think one of the things is really interesting.
[00:48:28.680 --> 00:48:33.320]   And they promise they've agreed to develop a compensation package that protects workers
[00:48:33.320 --> 00:48:37.440]   from losing income due to reduced overtime, in effect they're saying, "No, no, we're
[00:48:37.440 --> 00:48:40.640]   going to figure it out so that you make as much money even though you're working less."
[00:48:40.640 --> 00:48:41.640]   That's good.
[00:48:41.640 --> 00:48:47.920]   I mean, one of the things I think is really interesting about this is that our new information
[00:48:47.920 --> 00:48:53.600]   world, our information society, is how much of all of these actions are being created
[00:48:53.600 --> 00:48:55.560]   through because it's a PR issue.
[00:48:55.560 --> 00:48:57.000]   This isn't a regulatory issue.
[00:48:57.000 --> 00:48:58.000]   Totally.
[00:48:58.000 --> 00:48:59.000]   It's not regulatory.
[00:48:59.000 --> 00:49:00.000]   There's not, it's because it's a company.
[00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:02.720]   Apparently, the Chinese government's not enforcing its own laws.
[00:49:02.720 --> 00:49:07.160]   Well, it's interesting how important as we continue to move into this information age,
[00:49:07.160 --> 00:49:10.640]   it becomes to manage your public relations and how much more important that it becomes
[00:49:10.640 --> 00:49:12.360]   than even the regulations.
[00:49:12.360 --> 00:49:16.600]   I mean, it's important to manage all of the stuff from a PR perspective.
[00:49:16.600 --> 00:49:21.120]   Well, I also think that Apple actually cares about this issue.
[00:49:21.120 --> 00:49:26.640]   Even before the kerfuffle started up, they had a consistently, no electronics manufacturer
[00:49:26.640 --> 00:49:31.200]   has what we would call a fantastic record with labor because there's always a way you
[00:49:31.200 --> 00:49:32.600]   can make things better.
[00:49:32.600 --> 00:49:37.040]   But Apple always did more than they were required to, even just for PR purposes.
[00:49:37.040 --> 00:49:46.120]   And I think it's hard for us to know, I think the Mike Daisy affair demonstrates what's
[00:49:46.120 --> 00:49:51.920]   hard for us to know what's going on, how much of this is puffery, how much of this is honest
[00:49:51.920 --> 00:49:53.080]   and real.
[00:49:53.080 --> 00:49:56.440]   But I agree with you, Andy, and my gut tells me that Apple does care about this.
[00:49:56.440 --> 00:49:57.440]   We don't know.
[00:49:57.440 --> 00:49:58.440]   But my gut says you're right.
[00:49:58.440 --> 00:50:01.080]   My gut is that Tim Cook cares about it a lot more than Steve Jobs did.
[00:50:01.080 --> 00:50:02.320]   Yeah, and Tim is a supplier.
[00:50:02.320 --> 00:50:05.800]   I mean, he's a production guy.
[00:50:05.800 --> 00:50:10.840]   And of course, it was probably Tim that moved so much of this offshore because it's so much
[00:50:10.840 --> 00:50:13.760]   less expensive to make.
[00:50:13.760 --> 00:50:16.160]   But I have a feeling he's an honorable guy.
[00:50:16.160 --> 00:50:20.520]   And I would hope that he is going to make sure that the Foxconn employees get treated
[00:50:20.520 --> 00:50:21.520]   well.
[00:50:21.520 --> 00:50:24.480]   And I'll tell you what, Apple's more forefront than anybody else on this.
[00:50:24.480 --> 00:50:25.480]   H.P.
[00:50:25.480 --> 00:50:26.480]   Dell.
[00:50:26.480 --> 00:50:27.480]   No one's saying anything.
[00:50:27.480 --> 00:50:29.280]   I mean, Toshiba, hello.
[00:50:29.280 --> 00:50:30.280]   I mean, is anybody.
[00:50:30.280 --> 00:50:33.080]   I mean, we have to remember that everybody is getting stuff from Foxconn.
[00:50:33.080 --> 00:50:36.040]   So if they're not talking about it or not doing it, it's all the same for their employees,
[00:50:36.040 --> 00:50:37.040]   too.
[00:50:37.040 --> 00:50:42.800]   Foxconn recruiter, according to a Japanese broadcaster says, we're hiring, I'm going
[00:50:42.800 --> 00:50:46.240]   to cry for the June release of the iPhone 5.
[00:50:46.240 --> 00:50:49.520]   It's going to be the iPhone 4SX.
[00:50:49.520 --> 00:50:57.280]   And the conversation recorded by TV Tokyo and aired April 2nd, a Foxconn recruiter says
[00:50:57.280 --> 00:51:02.720]   the company needs to hire about 18,000 people for iPhone 5 manufacturer.
[00:51:02.720 --> 00:51:06.960]   The recruiter said, quote, because it seems it will go on sale in June.
[00:51:06.960 --> 00:51:10.360]   But is he guessing?
[00:51:10.360 --> 00:51:12.440]   Is he just trying to say seems?
[00:51:12.440 --> 00:51:17.600]   It's every time I see a quote like that, though, it really makes me think that it reminds
[00:51:17.600 --> 00:51:22.000]   me that the people who really know what they're talking about also know enough not to talk
[00:51:22.000 --> 00:51:23.000]   about it.
[00:51:23.000 --> 00:51:26.840]   I don't think that they would ever be within eight miles of a camera and say, oh, yes,
[00:51:26.840 --> 00:51:28.320]   well, we're planning to start to.
[00:51:28.320 --> 00:51:30.520]   I know the iPhone 5 is going to be shipping in June.
[00:51:30.520 --> 00:51:31.520]   Yeah, yeah, sure.
[00:51:31.520 --> 00:51:32.520]   But that's a really bad.
[00:51:32.520 --> 00:51:35.720]   That is what is known as a career limiting action.
[00:51:35.720 --> 00:51:40.720]   Well, having just spent money on getting an iPhone, both of us, I would hope that the
[00:51:40.720 --> 00:51:44.120]   iPhone doesn't come out till later.
[00:51:44.120 --> 00:51:46.280]   Everybody asked me and said, well, why don't you just wait till June?
[00:51:46.280 --> 00:51:49.640]   Because I hear the new and I thought, well, what if it doesn't?
[00:51:49.640 --> 00:51:53.080]   Well, but OK, but this is this is interesting.
[00:51:53.080 --> 00:51:58.360]   I certainly I absolutely I promise you, I don't mean this as sort of a snarky comment.
[00:51:58.360 --> 00:52:02.360]   Wouldn't have been interesting for you to say, I'm going to wait until the iPhone 5 comes
[00:52:02.360 --> 00:52:03.560]   out, whatever they're going to call it.
[00:52:03.560 --> 00:52:06.680]   And June, I'm going to make my galaxy note, my prime idea.
[00:52:06.680 --> 00:52:07.680]   Oh, it is.
[00:52:07.680 --> 00:52:08.880]   I'm going to switch completely.
[00:52:08.880 --> 00:52:15.040]   Well, well, even if you do do you why did you have to switch up to to a new phone today?
[00:52:15.040 --> 00:52:16.960]   Did you just need it just for the show?
[00:52:16.960 --> 00:52:18.800]   Yeah, I don't I don't know.
[00:52:18.800 --> 00:52:20.080]   I use the note entirely.
[00:52:20.080 --> 00:52:24.480]   In fact, I'm feeling a little weird because I left the note at home today.
[00:52:24.480 --> 00:52:25.480]   I love the note.
[00:52:25.480 --> 00:52:26.680]   Oh, the note is it for me.
[00:52:26.680 --> 00:52:28.280]   You can't come on the field trip.
[00:52:28.280 --> 00:52:32.600]   You think I would have dunked my primary phone into the into a glass of water?
[00:52:32.600 --> 00:52:33.960]   I'm not that stupid.
[00:52:33.960 --> 00:52:37.600]   No, no, no, that honestly, that's cool.
[00:52:37.600 --> 00:52:39.840]   That's that's you should use that every time you want.
[00:52:39.840 --> 00:52:43.760]   Every time someone asks you about like why you prefer like Android or iPhone, there is
[00:52:43.760 --> 00:52:48.440]   no greater demonstration that said that when you had to potentially sacrifice a device,
[00:52:48.440 --> 00:52:51.080]   you decided to sacrifice the iPhone and not the note.
[00:52:51.080 --> 00:52:52.080]   Yeah.
[00:52:52.080 --> 00:52:55.440]   No, and also because the liquid pill that I had to send this to them for several days,
[00:52:55.440 --> 00:52:56.920]   I'm not going to send my primary phone.
[00:52:56.920 --> 00:52:58.840]   So the no, no, the note is my phone.
[00:52:58.840 --> 00:53:00.440]   Oh, God, I love the note.
[00:53:00.440 --> 00:53:02.200]   Oh, I love it.
[00:53:02.200 --> 00:53:04.400]   But there you know where you know where the iPhone still gets me?
[00:53:04.400 --> 00:53:08.920]   There are a couple of apps that I that they're not available on the Android that I really
[00:53:08.920 --> 00:53:10.920]   want to use.
[00:53:10.920 --> 00:53:17.680]   That's I'm an exactly that same boat because I've been off and on like I have been I have
[00:53:17.680 --> 00:53:24.680]   had access to certain windows, phone devices for the for the past for the past since mango
[00:53:24.680 --> 00:53:26.920]   came out in the in the fall.
[00:53:26.920 --> 00:53:33.080]   And man, I get so close to saying this is just windows phone is just the way that I
[00:53:33.080 --> 00:53:34.400]   want to use a phone.
[00:53:34.400 --> 00:53:38.320]   I just wish that it had certain really critical apps that I love.
[00:53:38.320 --> 00:53:42.160]   That's the real that's the real downside on that one is it's perfect in every respect
[00:53:42.160 --> 00:53:44.440]   except it's missing all the function.
[00:53:44.440 --> 00:53:48.080]   If these two phones were made out of if these two phones were made out of Lego, like my
[00:53:48.080 --> 00:53:53.400]   windows phone and the iPhone, I would be probably taking 60% of the parts, software
[00:53:53.400 --> 00:53:57.720]   and hardware out of the iPhone and 40% of what makes the windows phone tick.
[00:53:57.720 --> 00:53:59.800]   And when I wake it up, it would look like windows phone.
[00:53:59.800 --> 00:54:00.800]   It wouldn't look like an iPhone.
[00:54:00.800 --> 00:54:04.200]   Looks like I picked a bad day to leave the note behind Instagram from Android came out
[00:54:04.200 --> 00:54:05.200]   today.
[00:54:05.200 --> 00:54:06.200]   That's correct.
[00:54:06.200 --> 00:54:09.000]   That's one of like the very few apps.
[00:54:09.000 --> 00:54:14.800]   Now the app that I that is only on the iPhone is the renew app for my renewal arm clock that
[00:54:14.800 --> 00:54:16.560]   watches me sleep.
[00:54:16.560 --> 00:54:17.560]   It watches you sleep?
[00:54:17.560 --> 00:54:18.800]   It watches me sleepy?
[00:54:18.800 --> 00:54:19.800]   Yeah.
[00:54:19.800 --> 00:54:21.000]   It's a stalker app.
[00:54:21.000 --> 00:54:26.880]   And the pair app, you know, the couples app, the pair app that's like the path for two
[00:54:26.880 --> 00:54:27.880]   people only.
[00:54:27.880 --> 00:54:30.400]   And those are the only two things.
[00:54:30.400 --> 00:54:35.520]   Everything else I've had in the paper on my windows phone for quite some time now.
[00:54:35.520 --> 00:54:38.360]   It's actually when the first I put something to download for the windows phone.
[00:54:38.360 --> 00:54:43.400]   I don't know what the problem was in getting the every note running on the Android platform.
[00:54:43.400 --> 00:54:47.840]   I don't know if that I wouldn't I wouldn't worry that that says something about how difficult
[00:54:47.840 --> 00:54:48.840]   it is to deploy.
[00:54:48.840 --> 00:54:55.560]   Not only do I have ever note on Android, but I have an ever note widget that I love widgets
[00:54:55.560 --> 00:55:02.320]   on Android that lets me to do instantly record and transcribe a note and automatically sync
[00:55:02.320 --> 00:55:06.640]   it to all my devices, including my iPhone, that lets me instantly take a picture and have
[00:55:06.640 --> 00:55:09.280]   it just in one button click go to my ever note database.
[00:55:09.280 --> 00:55:12.960]   Now, ever note is actually best on Android.
[00:55:12.960 --> 00:55:14.480]   I might add.
[00:55:14.480 --> 00:55:15.960]   Okay.
[00:55:15.960 --> 00:55:18.360]   But you're right, I don't have instant paper.
[00:55:18.360 --> 00:55:23.120]   There's an instant paper claim to available for you.
[00:55:23.120 --> 00:55:25.640]   You know, I have it sent everything sent to my Kindle.
[00:55:25.640 --> 00:55:28.480]   And once a week I read it on my Kindle.
[00:55:28.480 --> 00:55:32.240]   Isn't it seems like it seems like there are like five or six apps that are kind of like
[00:55:32.240 --> 00:55:37.480]   the equalizers of the platform wars because as soon as you buy a new phone, whether it's
[00:55:37.480 --> 00:55:41.960]   an iPhone, whether it's an Android, whether it's a Windows phone, so long as you download
[00:55:41.960 --> 00:55:46.120]   the Kindle lapse along as you download an app that gives you access to Dropbox and fill
[00:55:46.120 --> 00:55:49.880]   of the slots with two or three others that are pretty much universal apps at this point.
[00:55:49.880 --> 00:55:54.760]   It's not as though that's the complete equalizer, but that means that it turns it turns almost
[00:55:54.760 --> 00:55:58.240]   every phone into at least an option for almost every typical user.
[00:55:58.240 --> 00:56:00.200]   You can get here's the here's the truth.
[00:56:00.200 --> 00:56:05.560]   You can get to 90% of the functionality on any probably even on BlackBerry and and
[00:56:05.560 --> 00:56:06.560]   Symbian.
[00:56:06.560 --> 00:56:07.560]   You get a 90%.
[00:56:07.560 --> 00:56:09.400]   It's that last 10% that kills you.
[00:56:09.400 --> 00:56:12.920]   And if that last 10% is like something you really miss and love like Instagram would be
[00:56:12.920 --> 00:56:15.680]   a good example, then that's a deal breaker.
[00:56:15.680 --> 00:56:18.640]   It's like NASA used to say you don't get you don't get credit for getting getting the
[00:56:18.640 --> 00:56:20.720]   astronauts 90% of the way home.
[00:56:20.720 --> 00:56:23.200]   You got to get them all the way baby.
[00:56:23.200 --> 00:56:24.200]   Let's take a break.
[00:56:24.200 --> 00:56:27.680]   And when we come back, we do have a max story.
[00:56:27.680 --> 00:56:29.320]   So it well, it's a rumor.
[00:56:29.320 --> 00:56:30.320]   Try it.
[00:56:30.320 --> 00:56:31.320]   I try.
[00:56:31.320 --> 00:56:32.320]   It's a rumor.
[00:56:32.320 --> 00:56:37.880]   It's the best I could do for you today.
[00:56:37.880 --> 00:56:42.480]   That's first let's talk a little bit about carbonite, which is backup done right.
[00:56:42.480 --> 00:56:43.480]   I hope you're backing up.
[00:56:43.480 --> 00:56:45.040]   I hope you're using time machine.
[00:56:45.040 --> 00:56:47.600]   Time machine's fantastic.
[00:56:47.600 --> 00:56:53.800]   But there's a next step in disaster prevention, which means getting it off site.
[00:56:53.800 --> 00:56:56.840]   So time machine does two of the three things that I really think you want.
[00:56:56.840 --> 00:56:57.840]   It's automatic.
[00:56:57.840 --> 00:56:59.120]   You don't have to think about it.
[00:56:59.120 --> 00:57:00.120]   It's continual.
[00:57:00.120 --> 00:57:03.120]   So when you change a document, time machine automatically backs it up.
[00:57:03.120 --> 00:57:08.320]   It fails on that one thing, which is that the backup is in the same place as your originals.
[00:57:08.320 --> 00:57:11.400]   And that means if there's something really bad happens, a fire or somebody breaks in
[00:57:11.400 --> 00:57:14.480]   and steals everything, you're going to lose everything.
[00:57:14.480 --> 00:57:19.880]   So you by all means use a local backup, but add to it this off site backup that's done
[00:57:19.880 --> 00:57:20.880]   by carbonite.
[00:57:20.880 --> 00:57:25.520]   Whenever you're online, it automatically backs up your files to the internet.
[00:57:25.520 --> 00:57:26.520]   It's cloud storage.
[00:57:26.520 --> 00:57:27.520]   They're always available.
[00:57:27.520 --> 00:57:33.080]   You can look at them anywhere, anytime just log on to your carbonate account, Mac PC, smartphone,
[00:57:33.080 --> 00:57:36.320]   iPad, they have free apps everywhere.
[00:57:36.320 --> 00:57:37.600]   You log in and there's your stuff.
[00:57:37.600 --> 00:57:38.600]   You can get your stuff.
[00:57:38.600 --> 00:57:40.600]   And if the worst happens, restore is very easy.
[00:57:40.600 --> 00:57:43.840]   You just go to the new computer, for instance, log in to your carbonate account and restore
[00:57:43.840 --> 00:57:45.360]   all your data.
[00:57:45.360 --> 00:57:47.960]   All of this starts at less than five bucks a month.
[00:57:47.960 --> 00:57:49.320]   That's for everything on your internal drive.
[00:57:49.320 --> 00:57:51.240]   It's also the most affordable out there.
[00:57:51.240 --> 00:57:53.000]   It's not for five gigs or 25 gigs.
[00:57:53.000 --> 00:57:55.960]   It's for everything on your internal drive.
[00:57:55.960 --> 00:57:57.600]   And you can try it free for two weeks right now.
[00:57:57.600 --> 00:58:01.840]   If you use the offer code Mac break, you don't need a credit card, just go to carbonite.com.
[00:58:01.840 --> 00:58:03.760]   You'll see at the site they do have other plans.
[00:58:03.760 --> 00:58:05.160]   They have plans for external drives.
[00:58:05.160 --> 00:58:07.280]   They have plans for business.
[00:58:07.280 --> 00:58:08.960]   So pick the plan that's right for you.
[00:58:08.960 --> 00:58:10.200]   Then use the offer code Mac break.
[00:58:10.200 --> 00:58:11.200]   Try it free for two weeks.
[00:58:11.200 --> 00:58:15.680]   If you decide to buy 14 months for the price of 12 to three months when you use the offer
[00:58:15.680 --> 00:58:19.600]   code Mac break, another nice feature.
[00:58:19.600 --> 00:58:21.920]   And this is something iCloud does not offer.
[00:58:21.920 --> 00:58:25.640]   Carbonite has built in strong encryption and you have the key.
[00:58:25.640 --> 00:58:27.240]   Carbonite cannot see it.
[00:58:27.240 --> 00:58:29.760]   So if your privacy is important to you, that's another way.
[00:58:29.760 --> 00:58:33.040]   It beats Dropbox, iCloud and other cloud storage.
[00:58:33.040 --> 00:58:34.320]   You control the key.
[00:58:34.320 --> 00:58:36.560]   I was talking to David, friend, the CEO of Carbonite.
[00:58:36.560 --> 00:58:40.880]   He said we frequently get subpoenas for people's data on the cloud.
[00:58:40.880 --> 00:58:43.400]   And we just say, you're going to have to talk to them.
[00:58:43.400 --> 00:58:44.400]   You're going to have to talk to them.
[00:58:44.400 --> 00:58:45.640]   We don't have the key.
[00:58:45.640 --> 00:58:46.640]   We cannot look at it.
[00:58:46.640 --> 00:58:47.840]   We cannot show it to you.
[00:58:47.840 --> 00:58:50.800]   So if privacy is important, Carbonite is a great choice too.
[00:58:50.800 --> 00:58:54.320]   Carbonite.com, use the offer code Mac break.
[00:58:54.320 --> 00:58:55.320]   So the rumor.
[00:58:55.320 --> 00:58:58.400]   But I think this is so credible.
[00:58:58.400 --> 00:59:00.320]   I would say it's beyond a leak, beyond a rumor.
[00:59:00.320 --> 00:59:01.760]   It's certainly going to happen.
[00:59:01.760 --> 00:59:06.720]   Ivy Bridge is Intel's new chipset,
[00:59:06.720 --> 00:59:09.080]   has some nice features.
[00:59:09.080 --> 00:59:10.840]   And Intel themselves say we're going
[00:59:10.840 --> 00:59:14.640]   to start shipping Ivy Bridge next month.
[00:59:14.640 --> 00:59:17.680]   So it seems, I wouldn't say at all unlikely,
[00:59:17.680 --> 00:59:22.760]   that Ivy Bridge will show up on a Mac sometime next month.
[00:59:22.760 --> 00:59:24.680]   And all I've got to say is if this turns out to be true
[00:59:24.680 --> 00:59:26.720]   and they actually release a Mac Pro,
[00:59:26.720 --> 00:59:29.040]   which is say that they might release a Mac Pro,
[00:59:29.040 --> 00:59:34.080]   that the sales for Macs will be outstanding in the next quarter.
[00:59:34.080 --> 00:59:35.240]   But just because there's so many of us
[00:59:35.240 --> 00:59:38.040]   that are waiting for one more update.
[00:59:38.040 --> 00:59:42.000]   You know, one Thunderbolt-enpowered Mac Pro.
[00:59:42.000 --> 00:59:43.960]   And I know that there's a lot of people that are waiting,
[00:59:43.960 --> 00:59:45.400]   hoping that they're going to get anyone.
[00:59:45.400 --> 00:59:46.360]   Love that.
[00:59:46.360 --> 00:59:50.200]   CPU World posted a leak saying April 29.
[00:59:50.200 --> 00:59:52.960]   Several higher-end Ivy Bridge quad-core processors
[00:59:52.960 --> 00:59:55.920]   of both desktop and mobile flavors.
[00:59:55.920 --> 00:59:59.880]   A couple of the core i5 and i7 desktop processors.
[00:59:59.880 --> 01:00:06.160]   Two of the mobile processors, the 3720 and the 3820.
[01:00:06.160 --> 01:00:08.120]   A number of low-end configurations.
[01:00:08.120 --> 01:00:11.240]   You do get good power on Ivy Bridge.
[01:00:11.240 --> 01:00:18.440]   You get a lot of very economical power usage on these.
[01:00:18.440 --> 01:00:22.720]   So be nice.
[01:00:22.720 --> 01:00:25.880]   Low-power dual-core Ivy Bridge processors, 17 watt.
[01:00:25.880 --> 01:00:29.640]   That actually would work in the air, 17 watt.
[01:00:29.640 --> 01:00:31.120]   That would be maybe a new air.
[01:00:31.120 --> 01:00:32.720]   Those will come out early June, though,
[01:00:32.720 --> 01:00:34.520]   so don't wait for an air.
[01:00:34.520 --> 01:00:36.920]   I would bet they'll hold off until the part they want
[01:00:36.920 --> 01:00:38.120]   is available.
[01:00:38.120 --> 01:00:40.640]   You know, you're not going to rev them all at once.
[01:00:40.640 --> 01:00:46.240]   But a 22 nanometer MacBook Air may be in June.
[01:00:46.240 --> 01:00:49.640]   And I think someone on the IRC said
[01:00:49.640 --> 01:00:52.160]   that they have only a Thunderbolt fan.
[01:00:52.160 --> 01:00:54.400]   I got to say, we're using Thunderbolt more and more for drives.
[01:00:54.400 --> 01:00:55.840]   You're who Thunderbolt was made for.
[01:00:55.840 --> 01:00:57.200]   Oh my goodness.
[01:00:57.200 --> 01:01:01.200]   Because you have lots of money, you're willing to pay--
[01:01:01.200 --> 01:01:02.200]   No, no.
[01:01:02.200 --> 01:01:03.320]   You're willing to pay--
[01:01:03.320 --> 01:01:04.320]   I'm not sure.
[01:01:04.320 --> 01:01:07.520]   You need to pay high and for high-end speed.
[01:01:07.520 --> 01:01:09.720]   But it is very expensive, very low capacity.
[01:01:09.720 --> 01:01:13.840]   Well, so we just tested the--
[01:01:13.840 --> 01:01:14.760]   I'll bring it in.
[01:01:14.760 --> 01:01:18.040]   But one of the things that Seagate has
[01:01:18.040 --> 01:01:19.240]   is this Thunderbolt adapter.
[01:01:19.240 --> 01:01:20.840]   And so they have this whole thing where everything's
[01:01:20.840 --> 01:01:23.160]   modular, they're little drives and big drives.
[01:01:23.160 --> 01:01:25.280]   So I got the Thunderbolt adapter for the USB drive.
[01:01:25.280 --> 01:01:26.880]   So you pop the USB part off the bottom.
[01:01:26.880 --> 01:01:29.960]   And you stick it in the Thunderbolt and makes it fast.
[01:01:29.960 --> 01:01:33.360]   120 megs a second to that drive.
[01:01:33.360 --> 01:01:37.040]   And that's not a flash drive.
[01:01:37.040 --> 01:01:39.520]   That's a regular spinning 7200 RPM drive.
[01:01:39.520 --> 01:01:42.880]   But the drive is able to just go a lot faster.
[01:01:42.880 --> 01:01:47.040]   I mean, the drive is capable of a lot more than Firewire 800.
[01:01:47.040 --> 01:01:48.720]   You know, a lot of these drives are.
[01:01:48.720 --> 01:01:51.520]   And being able to tie that in and be able to back stuff up
[01:01:51.520 --> 01:01:54.600]   quickly is really, really makes a difference.
[01:01:54.600 --> 01:01:56.880]   Of course, because a lot of times what we're doing
[01:01:56.880 --> 01:01:58.000]   is we're also taking Seagate.
[01:01:58.000 --> 01:01:59.440]   They made one for their drives.
[01:01:59.440 --> 01:02:02.120]   Any of the Seagate drives themselves for this.
[01:02:02.120 --> 01:02:03.480]   But we use the Thunderbolt piece.
[01:02:03.480 --> 01:02:06.720]   And you can take your SSD drive and just slide it on.
[01:02:06.720 --> 01:02:08.960]   The raw SSD drive and slide it on.
[01:02:08.960 --> 01:02:10.440]   And you have a Thunderbolt interface
[01:02:10.440 --> 01:02:11.480]   and pull stuff off quickly.
[01:02:11.480 --> 01:02:12.840]   And it's cool.
[01:02:12.840 --> 01:02:14.440]   You got the Elgato.
[01:02:14.440 --> 01:02:16.000]   I have for review, I think it's the Elgato.
[01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:18.560]   It's 120 gig SSD.
[01:02:18.560 --> 01:02:20.360]   So it's very fast.
[01:02:20.360 --> 01:02:22.080]   I think it's that.
[01:02:22.080 --> 01:02:25.360]   But look at this, 120 gigs for $420.
[01:02:25.360 --> 01:02:26.720]   So yeah, it's fast.
[01:02:26.720 --> 01:02:28.920]   But even for you, you got to buy bigger capacities.
[01:02:28.920 --> 01:02:30.920]   And that was 120 gigs worth--
[01:02:30.920 --> 01:02:31.480]   No, no, no.
[01:02:31.480 --> 01:02:31.760]   We buy--
[01:02:31.760 --> 01:02:32.840]   Three minutes of video for you.
[01:02:32.840 --> 01:02:33.880]   No, I have a 512.
[01:02:33.880 --> 01:02:34.840]   Yeah.
[01:02:34.840 --> 01:02:36.640]   And I got to hold my 256s.
[01:02:36.640 --> 01:02:39.080]   Because we use them for our recorders use them,
[01:02:39.080 --> 01:02:40.320]   our little sound-like system.
[01:02:40.320 --> 01:02:40.720]   Yeah, I understand.
[01:02:40.720 --> 01:02:45.320]   I'm just wondering when this is going to make the mainstream.
[01:02:45.320 --> 01:02:46.200]   Oh, I think--
[01:02:46.200 --> 01:02:46.760]   Never.
[01:02:46.760 --> 01:02:47.280]   I don't know.
[01:02:47.280 --> 01:02:49.160]   As in, never.
[01:02:49.160 --> 01:02:51.040]   Thunderbolt or SSD?
[01:02:51.040 --> 01:02:52.600]   SSD is obviously mainstream.
[01:02:52.600 --> 01:02:53.240]   Well, as--
[01:02:53.240 --> 01:02:53.720]   As is--
[01:02:53.720 --> 01:02:55.000]   Thunderbolt.
[01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:57.920]   Well, see, that's kind of odd too.
[01:02:57.920 --> 01:02:59.440]   Well, there's no reason to put Thunderbolt
[01:02:59.440 --> 01:03:01.480]   on a regular drive.
[01:03:01.480 --> 01:03:02.240]   I mean, there is.
[01:03:02.240 --> 01:03:04.840]   But it's not-- I mean, you have Firewire 800,
[01:03:04.840 --> 01:03:06.400]   you have USB 3.
[01:03:06.400 --> 01:03:09.240]   There's plenty of throughput for regular spinning drives.
[01:03:09.240 --> 01:03:09.240]   Right.
[01:03:09.240 --> 01:03:09.920]   Is there?
[01:03:09.920 --> 01:03:13.040]   Well, the performance is higher on it with the Thunderbolt.
[01:03:13.040 --> 01:03:15.640]   Because the Firewire 800 is not saturated in the drive's
[01:03:15.640 --> 01:03:17.200]   ability to write and read.
[01:03:17.200 --> 01:03:18.600]   So the drives are faster than the--
[01:03:18.600 --> 01:03:19.600]   All right.
[01:03:19.600 --> 01:03:20.600]   Then Firewire--
[01:03:20.600 --> 01:03:21.760]   Well, that would be an argument then.
[01:03:21.760 --> 01:03:22.280]   Yeah.
[01:03:22.280 --> 01:03:23.760]   And USB 3 is same?
[01:03:23.760 --> 01:03:25.000]   Well, we're Mac users.
[01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:27.720]   So earlier, talk about USB 2, which is crud.
[01:03:27.720 --> 01:03:28.600]   Yeah.
[01:03:28.600 --> 01:03:31.360]   Well, but see, this is kind of my issue,
[01:03:31.360 --> 01:03:35.520]   is that Apple decided to go Thunderbolt instead of USB 3.
[01:03:35.520 --> 01:03:37.880]   Yeah, and I don't-- well, the thing-- great thing about
[01:03:37.880 --> 01:03:40.560]   USB Thunderbolt is is that it's also your monitor connection.
[01:03:40.560 --> 01:03:41.080]   It's also--
[01:03:41.080 --> 01:03:41.560]   Oh, yeah.
[01:03:41.560 --> 01:03:42.800]   You can pass a lot of other things to it.
[01:03:42.800 --> 01:03:44.120]   I understand all the great things.
[01:03:44.120 --> 01:03:45.840]   From a professional perspective, it
[01:03:45.840 --> 01:03:47.520]   has revolutionized what we're doing.
[01:03:47.520 --> 01:03:51.440]   Yeah, because it's very expensive.
[01:03:51.440 --> 01:03:53.800]   So for instance, there's will it get cheap?
[01:03:53.800 --> 01:03:55.160]   I don't know if it's going to get cheap.
[01:03:55.160 --> 01:03:58.520]   I just know that it is a production solution.
[01:03:58.520 --> 01:03:59.680]   No, I understand that.
[01:03:59.680 --> 01:04:01.040]   And I'm not gain saying that.
[01:04:01.040 --> 01:04:02.200]   I just think that that doesn't--
[01:04:02.200 --> 01:04:03.200]   Does the average consumer need it?
[01:04:03.200 --> 01:04:03.760]   Maybe not.
[01:04:03.760 --> 01:04:05.880]   But the main thing-- I think it needs Wi-Fi.
[01:04:05.880 --> 01:04:07.200]   I mean, for that.
[01:04:07.200 --> 01:04:08.360]   I mean, I'm not kidding.
[01:04:08.360 --> 01:04:10.160]   I mean, for most people, I use Wi-Fi.
[01:04:10.160 --> 01:04:10.560]   Yeah.
[01:04:10.560 --> 01:04:11.520]   I mean, most people can use Wi-Fi.
[01:04:11.520 --> 01:04:13.240]   They don't need to connect anything to their computers.
[01:04:13.240 --> 01:04:14.920]   That's fast enough for what most people are doing.
[01:04:14.920 --> 01:04:16.240]   But when you really need a fast connection,
[01:04:16.240 --> 01:04:19.600]   it has been this horrible situation for production folks,
[01:04:19.600 --> 01:04:20.640]   where we have to have cards.
[01:04:20.640 --> 01:04:22.080]   I mean, what Thunderbolt really does
[01:04:22.080 --> 01:04:25.000]   is it does mark the ending of needing a tower.
[01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:26.720]   Because a lot of what we were doing from a production
[01:04:26.720 --> 01:04:29.080]   perspective is we need towers for fast throughput.
[01:04:29.080 --> 01:04:31.360]   We need to have cards, specialized cards in the back
[01:04:31.360 --> 01:04:32.680]   that we don't need anymore.
[01:04:32.680 --> 01:04:34.800]   Like, we now-- we used to carry all these huge towers
[01:04:34.800 --> 01:04:35.480]   to productions.
[01:04:35.480 --> 01:04:38.160]   And now we can take a laptop and hook it to a little AJA,
[01:04:38.160 --> 01:04:41.280]   I-O-X-T or whatever and get dual video outs
[01:04:41.280 --> 01:04:43.080]   from a little Thunderbolt connection.
[01:04:43.080 --> 01:04:48.560]   And that's for us, that's pretty revolutionary.
[01:04:48.560 --> 01:04:51.920]   I hope Thunderbolt succeeds.
[01:04:51.920 --> 01:04:53.400]   It's been a while.
[01:04:53.400 --> 01:04:54.480]   It's been what, two years?
[01:04:54.480 --> 01:04:55.920]   Well, there's more and more coming out.
[01:04:55.920 --> 01:04:58.200]   We have more and more devices that we have.
[01:04:58.200 --> 01:05:02.040]   Now that Seagate has connections for us to actually use,
[01:05:02.040 --> 01:05:03.480]   a lot of the production equipment
[01:05:03.480 --> 01:05:05.120]   is now starting-- AJA and Blackmagic
[01:05:05.120 --> 01:05:07.520]   are both have Thunderbolt solutions.
[01:05:07.520 --> 01:05:08.840]   We're starting to see some of these hard drives.
[01:05:08.840 --> 01:05:10.240]   That little hard drive for 120 gigs,
[01:05:10.240 --> 01:05:13.760]   I don't know how useful that is for us.
[01:05:13.760 --> 01:05:15.880]   But Andy?
[01:05:15.880 --> 01:05:19.320]   Well, all I was going to be saying earlier was that it seems
[01:05:19.320 --> 01:05:21.560]   as though you get two circles that don't really overlap
[01:05:21.560 --> 01:05:22.440]   with each other.
[01:05:22.440 --> 01:05:24.600]   On the one hand, you want-- there are a lot of people
[01:05:24.600 --> 01:05:27.120]   who are going to need that really ultra high speed
[01:05:27.120 --> 01:05:30.560]   connection for whom the USB 2.0 isn't good enough.
[01:05:30.560 --> 01:05:33.840]   And that's a very special kind of person.
[01:05:33.840 --> 01:05:39.960]   I also think that people who can get by forever on 128 gigabytes
[01:05:39.960 --> 01:05:42.680]   of storage is also a very special kind of user.
[01:05:42.680 --> 01:05:44.480]   Though the suites-- really, you're
[01:05:44.480 --> 01:05:46.560]   talking about a minimum of 256.
[01:05:46.560 --> 01:05:48.520]   And even then, if you've got someone
[01:05:48.520 --> 01:05:51.320]   who did not come into the-- who is not really
[01:05:51.320 --> 01:05:53.720]   hard set on getting a Mac, when you tell them
[01:05:53.720 --> 01:05:57.520]   that you've got another machine that costs $300 less,
[01:05:57.520 --> 01:06:00.400]   that can store twice as many pictures and videos,
[01:06:00.400 --> 01:06:02.480]   and that it's unlikely that they'll ever really even
[01:06:02.480 --> 01:06:05.760]   need to dock an external drive to deal with all the stuff
[01:06:05.760 --> 01:06:09.000]   they're dealing with, that's a huge compelling argument.
[01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:11.640]   And when you are introducing them to an operating system that
[01:06:11.640 --> 01:06:15.400]   looks and feels in many ways as easy as the Mac,
[01:06:15.400 --> 01:06:17.760]   that's the only reason why I'm a little bit uneasy
[01:06:17.760 --> 01:06:20.880]   at the idea of Apple switching to-- if they were to be switching
[01:06:20.880 --> 01:06:25.320]   to SSDs for pretty much the majority of their line.
[01:06:25.320 --> 01:06:28.560]   I think that does represent a swing away from,
[01:06:28.560 --> 01:06:31.120]   we want to make computers to everybody and towards.
[01:06:31.120 --> 01:06:33.920]   We want to make computers for a specific kind of people
[01:06:33.920 --> 01:06:35.360]   that we think we understand.
[01:06:35.360 --> 01:06:36.640]   And we understand that these people
[01:06:36.640 --> 01:06:38.480]   don't need as much onboard storage
[01:06:38.480 --> 01:06:40.800]   as people think they do.
[01:06:40.800 --> 01:06:41.720]   That's what I--
[01:06:41.720 --> 01:06:42.960]   Are you muted at them?
[01:06:42.960 --> 01:06:44.880]   Because--
[01:06:44.880 --> 01:06:46.000]   You shouldn't be muted.
[01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:46.680]   Oh, yes I am.
[01:06:46.680 --> 01:06:48.200]   Ah, OK.
[01:06:48.200 --> 01:06:49.360]   I'm sure I'm saying it.
[01:06:49.360 --> 01:06:51.000]   I wasn't saying much either, but--
[01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:52.360]   OK.
[01:06:52.360 --> 01:06:55.080]   And I was trying to be quiet during the promo stuff.
[01:06:55.080 --> 01:06:55.580]   OK.
[01:06:55.580 --> 01:06:56.920]   He's been interested in--
[01:06:56.920 --> 01:06:59.920]   I find Thunderbolt a little bit troubling
[01:06:59.920 --> 01:07:02.240]   from the standpoint of just--
[01:07:02.240 --> 01:07:06.720]   I totally understand it at the high end where Alex is.
[01:07:06.720 --> 01:07:08.240]   But Apple switched to it.
[01:07:08.240 --> 01:07:10.520]   I mean, they've switched to it in the MacBook Airs.
[01:07:10.520 --> 01:07:12.200]   They have 11-inch MacBook Air.
[01:07:12.200 --> 01:07:15.760]   And it feels, yeah, you need it for the hooking
[01:07:15.760 --> 01:07:18.520]   to the Thunderbolt display.
[01:07:18.520 --> 01:07:22.600]   But after that, there's just not much there for--
[01:07:22.600 --> 01:07:25.000]   as Andy says, the rest of us.
[01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:29.120]   And so if you're going to have a MacBook Air with constrained
[01:07:29.120 --> 01:07:32.760]   local storage, you're really going to need to go--
[01:07:32.760 --> 01:07:33.520]   USB.
[01:07:33.520 --> 01:07:34.600]   --get something external.
[01:07:34.600 --> 01:07:36.000]   And it's USB.
[01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:40.200]   Oh, and what they-- what we really need is the Thunderbolt
[01:07:40.200 --> 01:07:42.720]   to Firewerk and, you know, connect with us.
[01:07:42.720 --> 01:07:44.440]   Well, and no one's yet told me--
[01:07:44.440 --> 01:07:46.480]   I've never been able to get a really good story on why
[01:07:46.480 --> 01:07:48.640]   this is so hard.
[01:07:48.640 --> 01:07:50.640]   You know, why are the cables $50?
[01:07:50.640 --> 01:07:54.320]   Why has it taken a year to get to having hard drives
[01:07:54.320 --> 01:07:55.360]   reliably available?
[01:07:55.360 --> 01:07:56.360]   I mean, that's not.
[01:07:56.360 --> 01:07:57.120]   Well, and why are we--
[01:07:57.120 --> 01:07:57.960]   --is the technology industry?
[01:07:57.960 --> 01:08:00.480]   I mean, what-- even the thing that we're missing is a hub.
[01:08:00.480 --> 01:08:02.280]   You know, like what I wanted to hit a Thunderbolt that hooks in.
[01:08:02.280 --> 01:08:04.720]   And I've got two Firewire connections and three USB
[01:08:04.720 --> 01:08:06.600]   connections and even USB 3 connections.
[01:08:06.600 --> 01:08:07.920]   I mean, someone needs to build a little box
[01:08:07.920 --> 01:08:09.520]   that we can just plug all this stuff into.
[01:08:09.520 --> 01:08:10.120]   Because it would be--
[01:08:10.120 --> 01:08:11.280]   and I'm just kind of--
[01:08:11.280 --> 01:08:12.840]   Now, those are the kind of things I'm surprised
[01:08:12.840 --> 01:08:13.040]   with.
[01:08:13.040 --> 01:08:16.080]   My sense is that Apple still lacks the market cloud
[01:08:16.080 --> 01:08:18.640]   to get these companies to solve these problems.
[01:08:18.640 --> 01:08:22.040]   They've decided that USB 3 is what they're going to work on
[01:08:22.040 --> 01:08:24.400]   because that's where the massive market is.
[01:08:24.400 --> 01:08:27.200]   And so you're not seeing the kind of innovation and Thunderbolt
[01:08:27.200 --> 01:08:29.920]   that you would expect because it's just not a big enough market.
[01:08:32.800 --> 01:08:34.680]   And it's expensive because of the people who buy it.
[01:08:34.680 --> 01:08:36.120]   It's the best thing to slice bread.
[01:08:36.120 --> 01:08:37.400]   You're willing to spend the money.
[01:08:37.400 --> 01:08:38.480]   It's your fault, Alex.
[01:08:38.480 --> 01:08:39.480]   I'm sorry.
[01:08:39.480 --> 01:08:40.480]   It's not the one.
[01:08:40.480 --> 01:08:42.480]   You can really see why Apple went for it, though.
[01:08:42.480 --> 01:08:45.640]   If it were just for the reason that they can take a whole bunch
[01:08:45.640 --> 01:08:48.760]   of ports away from their mobile Macs
[01:08:48.760 --> 01:08:51.480]   and replace it with this tiny one that will allow them
[01:08:51.480 --> 01:08:54.360]   to continue to make these really low profile machines,
[01:08:54.360 --> 01:08:56.840]   that really is the big win, I think, from Apple
[01:08:56.840 --> 01:08:59.160]   to actually do it this way.
[01:08:59.160 --> 01:08:59.920]   But I agree.
[01:08:59.920 --> 01:09:03.800]   I really thought that by now we'd start seeing a displacement
[01:09:03.800 --> 01:09:06.240]   of Firewire hard drives where they were already--
[01:09:06.240 --> 01:09:08.840]   they're already the machine that the hard drive that very few
[01:09:08.840 --> 01:09:12.520]   people were willing to spend an extra $40 to $50 to $75 for.
[01:09:12.520 --> 01:09:15.400]   But I would have thought that by now you would see the combo
[01:09:15.400 --> 01:09:19.360]   drives where you can buy the USB version of this for $150
[01:09:19.360 --> 01:09:21.880]   or you can buy the Thunderbolt version of this for $200.
[01:09:21.880 --> 01:09:22.840]   And we're not seeing that yet.
[01:09:22.840 --> 01:09:24.280]   Right.
[01:09:24.280 --> 01:09:26.280]   We're going to move quickly through a bunch of stories
[01:09:26.280 --> 01:09:32.000]   so we get to our picks of the week that nano-sim issue
[01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:32.920]   continues on.
[01:09:32.920 --> 01:09:36.240]   RIM is accusing Apple of cheating.
[01:09:36.240 --> 01:09:39.960]   The vote to determine whose nano-sim patent should become
[01:09:39.960 --> 01:09:41.840]   the standard has been postponed.
[01:09:41.840 --> 01:09:42.360]   Cheating.
[01:09:42.360 --> 01:09:43.400]   Cheating.
[01:09:43.400 --> 01:09:44.400]   Cheating.
[01:09:44.400 --> 01:09:48.040]   So Nokia refused to license patents from Apple in exchange
[01:09:48.040 --> 01:09:50.720]   for free use of Apple's technology.
[01:09:50.720 --> 01:09:57.320]   So the biggies are fighting. RIM said Apple is trying to rig
[01:09:57.320 --> 01:10:00.640]   the decision by registering its own personnel as representatives
[01:10:00.640 --> 01:10:05.080]   from Bell Mobility, SK Telecom, and KT Corp.
[01:10:05.080 --> 01:10:08.160]   Those are Apple's.
[01:10:08.160 --> 01:10:11.120]   They've petitioned the standard agency, ETSI,
[01:10:11.120 --> 01:10:15.200]   to ensure that proxy voting is not allowed in an effort
[01:10:15.200 --> 01:10:19.600]   to buy-- to get around Apple's cheating.
[01:10:19.600 --> 01:10:21.840]   That's pretty nasty.
[01:10:21.840 --> 01:10:23.960]   So they want people to show up, no proxy voting.
[01:10:23.960 --> 01:10:25.440]   You've got to show up and we've got to look at you.
[01:10:25.440 --> 01:10:28.960]   Look at you in the eye and say, are you an Apple or are you
[01:10:28.960 --> 01:10:31.600]   somebody else?
[01:10:31.600 --> 01:10:32.840]   Let me smell your hair.
[01:10:32.840 --> 01:10:34.400]   Smells like strawberries.
[01:10:34.400 --> 01:10:36.720]   You're out.
[01:10:36.720 --> 01:10:39.320]   iPhone outsell all other smartphones combined
[01:10:39.320 --> 01:10:42.840]   at Sprint and AT&T.
[01:10:42.840 --> 01:10:46.720]   Some say that under Tim Cook, this is a Mac Rumors article,
[01:10:46.720 --> 01:10:50.560]   Apple's patent war, "Maley Descendements."
[01:10:50.560 --> 01:10:52.480]   This comes from Bloomberg Business Week, a cover
[01:10:52.480 --> 01:10:56.160]   storing on the continuing war against Android.
[01:10:56.160 --> 01:10:59.440]   The scorched earth policy was established by Steve Jobs,
[01:10:59.440 --> 01:11:01.440]   who said, I will bury you.
[01:11:01.440 --> 01:11:03.200]   We will bury you.
[01:11:03.200 --> 01:11:05.560]   But people familiar with the situation according
[01:11:05.560 --> 01:11:08.760]   to Business Week say top level executives of both Apple
[01:11:08.760 --> 01:11:10.960]   and Samsung have communicated lately
[01:11:10.960 --> 01:11:13.520]   about potential settlement options.
[01:11:13.520 --> 01:11:15.760]   Apple CEO Tim Cook does not seem to share
[01:11:15.760 --> 01:11:21.280]   his predecessors' passion about laying all foes to waste.
[01:11:21.280 --> 01:11:25.400]   There's also-- it seems consistent that when you see a change
[01:11:25.400 --> 01:11:28.240]   of CEO, oftentimes a change of these priorities that
[01:11:28.240 --> 01:11:31.360]   once-- action like this, which once seemed productive,
[01:11:31.360 --> 01:11:32.960]   now no longer seems productive.
[01:11:32.960 --> 01:11:34.560]   Remember that when Steve Jobs came in,
[01:11:34.560 --> 01:11:36.720]   one of the first things he did was saying that it really
[01:11:36.720 --> 01:11:39.280]   doesn't make any sense for spending so much time and resources
[01:11:39.280 --> 01:11:40.320]   suing Microsoft.
[01:11:40.320 --> 01:11:41.880]   Having them sue it shut, let's figure out a way
[01:11:41.880 --> 01:11:44.320]   that we can settle these and just get rid of this
[01:11:44.320 --> 01:11:45.160]   and move forward.
[01:11:45.160 --> 01:11:47.320]   Yeah, Tim has to find his own grudge.
[01:11:47.320 --> 01:11:49.800]   And they're going to get the hostages released too.
[01:11:49.800 --> 01:11:51.080]   Except for you, Leo.
[01:11:51.080 --> 01:11:53.120]   You are-- like, no, I'm consistent.
[01:11:53.120 --> 01:11:56.120]   I'm consistent.
[01:11:56.120 --> 01:11:59.160]   Until the end of time, I think that--
[01:11:59.160 --> 01:12:01.960]   yeah, Steve said, hey, Tim, on his bed.
[01:12:01.960 --> 01:12:03.920]   Tim, if you want to settle, Android, go ahead.
[01:12:03.920 --> 01:12:05.000]   But that Leo guy--
[01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:05.640]   Do not.
[01:12:05.640 --> 01:12:09.600]   --under no circumstances ever let him in another event.
[01:12:09.600 --> 01:12:10.760]   He's never going to be the key.
[01:12:10.760 --> 01:12:12.080]   He's the silver gun in the golden bullet
[01:12:12.080 --> 01:12:14.680]   that I hadn't made to do with.
[01:12:14.680 --> 01:12:16.640]   I'm making this charge from my hand.
[01:12:16.640 --> 01:12:18.360]   That's pure self-aggrandizement.
[01:12:18.360 --> 01:12:21.280]   Of course, they don't even know who I am.
[01:12:21.280 --> 01:12:24.160]   Other stories-- let's see.
[01:12:24.160 --> 01:12:26.440]   Sweden joins Australia in complaining
[01:12:26.440 --> 01:12:30.560]   about the use of the word 4G and LTE and iPad sales,
[01:12:30.560 --> 01:12:33.760]   because, of course, it only supports US LTE.
[01:12:33.760 --> 01:12:36.480]   The good news is if you visit the US from Sweden or Australia,
[01:12:36.480 --> 01:12:38.560]   it will work great.
[01:12:38.560 --> 01:12:41.480]   I think they kind of have a point.
[01:12:41.480 --> 01:12:42.040]   Right?
[01:12:42.040 --> 01:12:43.600]   I mean, it isn't LTE.
[01:12:43.600 --> 01:12:47.080]   It doesn't work in the frequencies in those countries.
[01:12:47.080 --> 01:12:48.240]   It's a mess.
[01:12:48.240 --> 01:12:49.320]   It's a mess.
[01:12:49.320 --> 01:12:51.000]   You know, I can understand, on the one hand,
[01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:54.200]   Apple doesn't want to make Defran ads for every country.
[01:12:54.200 --> 01:12:57.040]   But technically, it is LTE compatible.
[01:12:57.040 --> 01:12:58.120]   Just US LTE.
[01:12:58.120 --> 01:12:59.480]   Usually, what they need is a little disclaimer
[01:12:59.480 --> 01:13:01.600]   at the bottom of the text, USL.
[01:13:01.600 --> 01:13:03.280]   And really, really quick tech.
[01:13:03.280 --> 01:13:04.120]   Probably half a minute.
[01:13:04.120 --> 01:13:04.600]   Probably do.
[01:13:04.600 --> 01:13:06.080]   I would guess they do.
[01:13:06.080 --> 01:13:09.160]   Not offer not available anywhere except the USV.
[01:13:09.160 --> 01:13:12.040]   Just another price you pay for not living in the land
[01:13:12.040 --> 01:13:13.000]   of the free and the free and the free.
[01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:16.360]   If you lived here, you'd be downloaded by now.
[01:13:16.360 --> 01:13:22.240]   98% of iPad owners are satisfied with the device
[01:13:22.240 --> 01:13:23.800]   according to ChangeWave.
[01:13:23.800 --> 01:13:26.800]   98% of the 200 people they asked.
[01:13:26.800 --> 01:13:29.120]   And none is very dissatisfied.
[01:13:29.120 --> 01:13:29.720]   Well, come on.
[01:13:29.720 --> 01:13:31.200]   The other two drop them in the bathtub.
[01:13:31.200 --> 01:13:32.200]   Yeah.
[01:13:32.200 --> 01:13:33.040]   Do not.
[01:13:33.040 --> 01:13:33.800]   Do not.
[01:13:33.800 --> 01:13:38.320]   Apple working on, according to a Chinese source,
[01:13:38.320 --> 01:13:40.520]   a Japanese website.
[01:13:40.520 --> 01:13:43.960]   So the Chinese source tells us that a Japanese website,
[01:13:43.960 --> 01:13:48.320]   Makotakara, reported that Apple is working on a five inch
[01:13:48.320 --> 01:13:51.280]   written display device for next year,
[01:13:51.280 --> 01:13:54.880]   either 1600 by 960 or 1280 by 960.
[01:13:54.880 --> 01:13:56.600]   We don't know.
[01:13:56.600 --> 01:13:57.360]   This is BS.
[01:13:57.360 --> 01:13:59.680]   I'm not even going to read anymore.
[01:13:59.680 --> 01:14:01.600]   Go to Mac rumors and you can read about it.
[01:14:01.600 --> 01:14:05.080]   Actually, that's from-- yeah, Apple Insider.
[01:14:05.080 --> 01:14:06.880]   Ah.
[01:14:06.880 --> 01:14:09.440]   Mac flashback Trojan, you brought it up.
[01:14:09.440 --> 01:14:13.000]   You explained it at amanxt tidbits.com.
[01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:15.720]   Yeah, this just doesn't go away.
[01:14:15.720 --> 01:14:19.920]   I mean, flashback, I think it first popped up late last year.
[01:14:19.920 --> 01:14:22.440]   And it's morphing like crazy.
[01:14:22.440 --> 01:14:25.320]   I mean, they shouldn't perhaps say it's morphing.
[01:14:25.320 --> 01:14:28.440]   The people who make it are changing it constantly.
[01:14:28.440 --> 01:14:29.920]   You're taking advantage of it.
[01:14:29.920 --> 01:14:30.360]   Yeah, right.
[01:14:30.360 --> 01:14:31.520]   No, it's not.
[01:14:31.520 --> 01:14:33.560]   That would be even scarier.
[01:14:33.560 --> 01:14:35.040]   But nonetheless, it's taking advantage
[01:14:35.040 --> 01:14:37.480]   of job of vulnerabilities.
[01:14:37.480 --> 01:14:39.080]   It's switched over time, which one's
[01:14:39.080 --> 01:14:40.600]   taking advantage of.
[01:14:40.600 --> 01:14:43.320]   And the latest one, I believe, I said,
[01:14:43.320 --> 01:14:46.200]   I haven't got a chance to research this personally
[01:14:46.200 --> 01:14:47.560]   in a significant way yet.
[01:14:47.560 --> 01:14:51.240]   But the latest one is another Java vulnerability.
[01:14:51.240 --> 01:14:52.640]   And the virus makers--
[01:14:52.640 --> 01:14:55.080]   antivirus companies are saying, just turn off Java
[01:14:55.080 --> 01:14:56.160]   if you don't need it.
[01:14:56.160 --> 01:14:58.720]   And that's pretty annoying.
[01:14:58.720 --> 01:15:00.360]   I mean, Apple, obviously, there's
[01:15:00.360 --> 01:15:02.160]   new versions of Java that can be installed.
[01:15:02.160 --> 01:15:04.040]   Apple needs to get those out.
[01:15:04.040 --> 01:15:07.640]   But these people behind Flashback
[01:15:07.640 --> 01:15:09.520]   are moving awfully quickly.
[01:15:09.520 --> 01:15:12.480]   And they're pretty good at social engineering, too,
[01:15:12.480 --> 01:15:16.360]   in terms of popping up the fake certificate dialogues.
[01:15:16.360 --> 01:15:19.000]   So people get people to enter the admin password.
[01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:22.800]   And I'm really frustrated by this,
[01:15:22.800 --> 01:15:26.200]   because for the longest time, I used to say, look,
[01:15:26.200 --> 01:15:29.280]   just pay attention, and you won't have any problems.
[01:15:29.280 --> 01:15:32.560]   And it's gotten to the point now where
[01:15:32.560 --> 01:15:35.480]   the social engineering and the vulnerabilities that
[01:15:35.480 --> 01:15:38.440]   can be exploited quickly enough are
[01:15:38.440 --> 01:15:41.880]   severe enough to let something like this through that I'm
[01:15:41.880 --> 01:15:45.160]   saying, if you're not a relatively sophisticated Mac
[01:15:45.160 --> 01:15:49.320]   user, you probably should be running some antivirus software.
[01:15:49.320 --> 01:15:51.480]   And it pains me to say that in some ways,
[01:15:51.480 --> 01:15:54.800]   because I sort of the longest time just felt you could be aware
[01:15:54.800 --> 01:15:56.280]   and you'd be OK.
[01:15:56.280 --> 01:15:59.960]   But I've seen too many people who got caught by Mac Defender
[01:15:59.960 --> 01:16:03.280]   or getting caught by Flashback just because they're
[01:16:03.280 --> 01:16:09.040]   being normal users and don't know what a proper certificate
[01:16:09.040 --> 01:16:10.320]   prompt looks like.
[01:16:10.320 --> 01:16:13.520]   It's unfortunate because while Oracle has updated Java
[01:16:13.520 --> 01:16:18.240]   for other platforms, Apple doesn't use Oracle/Sun's Java.
[01:16:18.240 --> 01:16:21.480]   They do their own, and Apple has not updated their Java.
[01:16:21.480 --> 01:16:21.980]   Right.
[01:16:21.980 --> 01:16:22.800]   And they need to push one out.
[01:16:22.800 --> 01:16:23.600]   And then they probably will.
[01:16:23.600 --> 01:16:25.760]   Apple has actually been reacting pretty quickly
[01:16:25.760 --> 01:16:29.640]   to Flashback, building it into Ex-Protect at the low level
[01:16:29.640 --> 01:16:30.880]   in the system and things like that.
[01:16:30.880 --> 01:16:33.080]   But they're not the fastest.
[01:16:33.080 --> 01:16:35.120]   I mean, Apple is not one of those companies
[01:16:35.120 --> 01:16:36.800]   that will turn on a dime.
[01:16:36.800 --> 01:16:40.640]   They will consider for a little while a week to 10 days
[01:16:40.640 --> 01:16:43.960]   later, something will come out, which probably is OK.
[01:16:43.960 --> 01:16:47.680]   But certainly for peace of mind, it would be nice if you had
[01:16:47.680 --> 01:16:49.480]   that real sense that boom, they were on it.
[01:16:49.480 --> 01:16:51.520]   But Apple doesn't say anything for the longest time.
[01:16:51.520 --> 01:16:53.720]   And then the fix just sort of appears.
[01:16:53.720 --> 01:16:58.400]   Yeah.
[01:16:58.400 --> 01:16:59.360]   Bad stuff.
[01:16:59.360 --> 01:17:01.000]   Turn off Java.
[01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:03.240]   If you want to know more about this F-Secure, which
[01:17:03.240 --> 01:17:06.600]   is a very good antivirus and security company,
[01:17:06.600 --> 01:17:09.320]   been around for a long time, f-secure.com,
[01:17:09.320 --> 01:17:15.120]   has a long article on what Flashback does, how
[01:17:15.120 --> 01:17:17.720]   to detect it, what to look for.
[01:17:17.720 --> 01:17:18.640]   Now, here's the good news.
[01:17:18.640 --> 01:17:21.280]   As far as anybody knows, the only thing Flashback does
[01:17:21.280 --> 01:17:25.560]   is it modifies content displayed by your web browser.
[01:17:25.560 --> 01:17:27.240]   It's not like it's--
[01:17:27.240 --> 01:17:29.880]   it doesn't seem to be doing anything too nasty.
[01:17:29.880 --> 01:17:33.520]   Previous versions could report information back.
[01:17:33.520 --> 01:17:34.040]   OK.
[01:17:34.040 --> 01:17:35.680]   So maybe that capability is just--
[01:17:35.680 --> 01:17:38.640]   So I have again, I haven't looked into this new version
[01:17:38.640 --> 01:17:39.440]   closely yet.
[01:17:39.440 --> 01:17:43.200]   But it's not really bad in terms of like, oh, it's
[01:17:43.200 --> 01:17:45.600]   going to delete your hard disk or anything like that.
[01:17:45.600 --> 01:17:47.680]   But it was not a good one.
[01:17:47.680 --> 01:17:50.560]   So for my grandmother and others who
[01:17:50.560 --> 01:17:54.000]   want to know how to do this, open your terminal
[01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:55.880]   and enter the command--
[01:17:55.880 --> 01:17:57.280]   oops, let's not install an update.
[01:17:57.280 --> 01:17:58.040]   We'll do that later.
[01:17:58.040 --> 01:18:05.240]   Enter the command defaults read/applications/percent-browser.app/content/it
[01:18:05.240 --> 01:18:07.760]   shows that ls environment.
[01:18:07.760 --> 01:18:10.200]   And then see, now I don't--
[01:18:10.200 --> 01:18:13.680]   I don't even exist for me.
[01:18:13.680 --> 01:18:15.800]   But that's good.
[01:18:15.800 --> 01:18:19.800]   If it does exist, then you're infected.
[01:18:19.800 --> 01:18:22.040]   So anyway--
[01:18:22.040 --> 01:18:23.040]   And to be--
[01:18:23.040 --> 01:18:24.280]   That's an easy check.
[01:18:24.280 --> 01:18:26.080]   Anybody can run at home.
[01:18:26.080 --> 01:18:28.720]   The variants have been coming so quickly,
[01:18:28.720 --> 01:18:33.160]   one every two to four weeks, that that check may work now,
[01:18:33.160 --> 01:18:34.880]   but may not work in two weeks too.
[01:18:34.880 --> 01:18:36.960]   That's why you're a morph a virus, of course.
[01:18:36.960 --> 01:18:37.960]   Yeah, precisely.
[01:18:37.960 --> 01:18:41.960]   And so for a while, it was using four character names
[01:18:41.960 --> 01:18:43.120]   in a particular folder.
[01:18:43.120 --> 01:18:45.760]   And now there's so many of them that you can't possibly
[01:18:45.760 --> 01:18:47.400]   tell if they're real or not.
[01:18:47.400 --> 01:18:50.760]   So yeah, the big solution is go into your browser
[01:18:50.760 --> 01:18:53.080]   and go into the preferences and turn off Java for the moment.
[01:18:53.080 --> 01:18:55.560]   And be very, very careful if anything
[01:18:55.560 --> 01:18:58.640]   that you asked you for your admin password when you didn't
[01:18:58.640 --> 01:19:01.960]   just ask for something to install.
[01:19:01.960 --> 01:19:03.960]   That's kind of hard advice to give people.
[01:19:03.960 --> 01:19:04.960]   It sucks.
[01:19:04.960 --> 01:19:07.240]   It sucks.
[01:19:07.240 --> 01:19:09.120]   What I'm telling people is to-- this is another reason why
[01:19:09.120 --> 01:19:11.720]   you need to have two browsers installed at the same time.
[01:19:11.720 --> 01:19:13.320]   The one that you use all the time is the one
[01:19:13.320 --> 01:19:15.520]   that you have Java turned off completely.
[01:19:15.520 --> 01:19:18.160]   And then when there are a couple of instances in which you--
[01:19:18.160 --> 01:19:20.680]   when you hit a website where it really does install--
[01:19:20.680 --> 01:19:23.360]   in this you have the Java plug and working,
[01:19:23.360 --> 01:19:25.760]   then you switch over-- that's when you finally launch Chrome
[01:19:25.760 --> 01:19:28.320]   or you finally launch this other browser that has it enabled.
[01:19:28.320 --> 01:19:32.000]   Do that one thing you have to do with it and then quit it again.
[01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:34.840]   So what do you do if your house is robbed,
[01:19:34.840 --> 01:19:39.040]   Crook Steel $350,000 worth of stuff from you
[01:19:39.040 --> 01:19:41.640]   and you're eight years old?
[01:19:41.640 --> 01:19:42.480]   Ah!
[01:19:42.480 --> 01:19:43.480]   $350,000?
[01:19:43.480 --> 01:19:44.280]   Yeah.
[01:19:44.280 --> 01:19:47.160]   You turn on, find my iPad.
[01:19:47.160 --> 01:19:50.520]   Like this eight year old did.
[01:19:50.520 --> 01:19:53.280]   And he catch the burglar.
[01:19:53.280 --> 01:19:56.200]   He catch them.
[01:19:56.200 --> 01:19:58.880]   Eight year old uses-- this is today's show.
[01:19:58.880 --> 01:19:59.720]   This is his dad.
[01:19:59.720 --> 01:20:00.640]   We can listen to it a little bit.
[01:20:00.640 --> 01:20:01.440]   I don't think they'll--
[01:20:01.440 --> 01:20:02.920]   I'm just driving through whatever.
[01:20:02.920 --> 01:20:03.920]   So--
[01:20:03.920 --> 01:20:05.360]   They broke in.
[01:20:05.360 --> 01:20:07.440]   And you lost a lot of items, a couple of iPads,
[01:20:07.440 --> 01:20:09.680]   bought a new one with the insurance money.
[01:20:09.680 --> 01:20:12.920]   Landon, you didn't like the idea of your stuff being taken.
[01:20:12.920 --> 01:20:14.920]   What made you decide to look on the internet
[01:20:14.920 --> 01:20:16.520]   and discover there's an app for that?
[01:20:16.520 --> 01:20:17.520]   You said.
[01:20:17.520 --> 01:20:19.480]   Um.
[01:20:19.480 --> 01:20:20.320]   He's eight years old.
[01:20:20.320 --> 01:20:21.160]   I don't really know.
[01:20:21.160 --> 01:20:22.440]   I just wanted to find my iPad.
[01:20:22.440 --> 01:20:24.960]   So I just looked it up and I found this app.
[01:20:24.960 --> 01:20:26.000]   I found this app.
[01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:27.880]   He just found my iPad.
[01:20:27.880 --> 01:20:29.360]   He eight years old.
[01:20:29.360 --> 01:20:31.200]   He found his iPad.
[01:20:31.200 --> 01:20:32.960]   And you got to turn it on first.
[01:20:32.960 --> 01:20:34.760]   He must have been ready for it.
[01:20:34.760 --> 01:20:36.200]   I think he's sandbagging us.
[01:20:36.200 --> 01:20:38.120]   Yeah, he's sandbagging us.
[01:20:38.120 --> 01:20:41.080]   Clearly, today's show guy has no idea
[01:20:41.080 --> 01:20:42.600]   that this is on the Mac.
[01:20:42.600 --> 01:20:43.080]   Yeah.
[01:20:43.080 --> 01:20:45.440]   How did you find an app to do that?
[01:20:45.440 --> 01:20:47.600]   You're an idiot, so I'm just going to play along.
[01:20:47.600 --> 01:20:50.240]   But anybody who has an iPad knows,
[01:20:50.240 --> 01:20:52.160]   you just have to find my iPad turned on.
[01:20:52.160 --> 01:20:53.160]   And I'm going to find my iPad.
[01:20:53.160 --> 01:20:54.160]   I'm going to find my iPad.
[01:20:54.160 --> 01:20:55.160]   I'm going to find my iPad.

[01:22:53.160 --> 01:22:54.160]   I'm going to find my iPad.
[01:22:54.160 --> 01:22:55.160]   I'm going to find my iPad.
[01:22:55.160 --> 01:22:56.160]   I'm going to find my iPad.
[01:22:56.160 --> 01:22:57.160]   I'm going to find my iPad.
[01:22:57.160 --> 01:22:58.160]   I'm going to find my iPad.
[01:22:58.160 --> 01:22:59.160]   I'm going to find my iPad.
[01:22:59.160 --> 01:23:00.160]   I'm going to find my iPad.
[01:23:00.160 --> 01:23:01.160]   I'm going to find my iPad.
[01:23:01.160 --> 01:23:02.160]   I'm going to find my iPad.
[01:23:02.160 --> 01:23:03.160]   I'm going to find my iPad.
[01:23:03.160 --> 01:23:04.160]   I'm going to find my iPad.
[01:23:04.160 --> 01:23:05.160]   I'm going to find my iPad.
[01:23:05.160 --> 01:23:06.160]   I'm going to find my iPad.
[01:23:06.160 --> 01:23:07.160]   I'm going to find my iPad.
[01:23:07.160 --> 01:23:08.160]   I'm going to find my iPad.
[01:23:08.160 --> 01:23:09.160]   I'm going to find my iPad.
[01:23:10.160 --> 01:23:11.160]   I'm sorry.
[01:23:11.160 --> 01:23:14.160]   We're just jealous because he has 18 billion followers on Twitter.
[01:23:14.160 --> 01:23:15.160]   Apple or Creels.
[01:23:15.160 --> 01:23:17.160]   It was 18 billion dollars.
[01:23:17.160 --> 01:23:18.160]   Yeah.
[01:23:18.160 --> 01:23:19.160]   He's all saying.
[01:23:19.160 --> 01:23:25.160]   Someone pointed out on the chat that Tom Cruise would actually make him good to you.
[01:23:25.160 --> 01:23:26.160]   He's got the energy.
[01:23:26.160 --> 01:23:27.160]   That's the whole thing.
[01:23:27.160 --> 01:23:28.160]   He's not the look.
[01:23:28.160 --> 01:23:29.160]   It's the energy.
[01:23:29.160 --> 01:23:31.160]   Problem is it would just be Tom Cruisey.
[01:23:31.160 --> 01:23:32.160]   Yeah.
[01:23:32.160 --> 01:23:33.160]   He'd be Tom Cruise.
[01:23:33.160 --> 01:23:35.160]   The guy Tom Cruise played in Magnolia.
[01:23:35.160 --> 01:23:38.160]   He played like a motivational speaker.
[01:23:38.160 --> 01:23:39.160]   He was facing the stage with the headset.
[01:23:39.160 --> 01:23:40.160]   Perfect.
[01:23:40.160 --> 01:23:41.160]   Yeah.
[01:23:41.160 --> 01:23:42.160]   Perfect.
[01:23:42.160 --> 01:23:44.160]   Apple is going to increase the iAd revenue to 70%.
[01:23:44.160 --> 01:23:47.160]   They're trying to get more people to use iAd.
[01:23:47.160 --> 01:23:50.160]   I don't see a lot of iAds, do you?
[01:23:50.160 --> 01:23:52.160]   No, because you have to have 100,000.
[01:23:52.160 --> 01:23:53.160]   Well, now you have to have 100,000.
[01:23:53.160 --> 01:23:56.160]   You just have to have a half million to advertise on it.
[01:23:56.160 --> 01:23:57.160]   I think that that's...
[01:23:57.160 --> 01:24:01.160]   And let Apple do your design, which is really overdoing.
[01:24:01.160 --> 01:24:02.160]   There's a bottleneck for you.
[01:24:02.160 --> 01:24:05.160]   No, we'll take care of that gradient.
[01:24:05.160 --> 01:24:06.160]   It's just not right.
[01:24:06.160 --> 01:24:07.160]   And we help you.
[01:24:07.160 --> 01:24:10.160]   The yellow is just a little bit too hot.
[01:24:10.160 --> 01:24:12.160]   Hey, no gloss like an apple gloss.
[01:24:12.160 --> 01:24:15.160]   The apple gloss goes, "Hey, hey."
[01:24:15.160 --> 01:24:17.160]   All right, we're going to take...
[01:24:17.160 --> 01:24:20.160]   So glad I switched just in time.
[01:24:20.160 --> 01:24:22.160]   Oh, that was...
[01:24:22.160 --> 01:24:23.160]   That's better than a squirrel.
[01:24:23.160 --> 01:24:24.160]   Yeah.
[01:24:24.160 --> 01:24:27.160]   We're going to take a break and come back with your picks of the week, gentlemen.
[01:24:27.160 --> 01:24:28.160]   Prepare.
[01:24:28.160 --> 01:24:30.160]   Start your pick engines.
[01:24:30.160 --> 01:24:31.160]   I got a good one.
[01:24:31.160 --> 01:24:33.160]   Oh, I got a good one too.
[01:24:33.160 --> 01:24:34.160]   I got a good one.
[01:24:34.160 --> 01:24:35.160]   You got an interesting one.
[01:24:35.160 --> 01:24:36.160]   I got a couple.
[01:24:36.160 --> 01:24:37.160]   You got more than one?
[01:24:37.160 --> 01:24:38.160]   Well, I got a software.
[01:24:38.160 --> 01:24:41.160]   And I promise I'll bring that SSD in next week so we can play with it.
[01:24:41.160 --> 01:24:42.160]   Okay.
[01:24:42.160 --> 01:24:43.160]   I'll test it.
[01:24:43.160 --> 01:24:44.160]   Would you, because what I'd like to...
[01:24:44.160 --> 01:24:45.160]   I've been downloading...
[01:24:45.160 --> 01:24:47.160]   I found a good testing program to test throughput.
[01:24:47.160 --> 01:24:53.160]   So I want to compare it to the SSD built in to my iMac and the Apple SSDs built in my iMac
[01:24:53.160 --> 01:24:54.160]   and Air.
[01:24:54.160 --> 01:24:58.160]   The hard drive on my Mac Pro and then the throughput on the Mac Pro when I use...
[01:24:58.160 --> 01:25:00.160]   Oh, I can't do it on...
[01:25:00.160 --> 01:25:02.160]   See, if I had Thunderbolt on the Mac Pro...
[01:25:02.160 --> 01:25:04.160]   This is why we're all waiting.
[01:25:04.160 --> 01:25:05.160]   I can't.
[01:25:05.160 --> 01:25:06.160]   I can't.
[01:25:06.160 --> 01:25:07.160]   I can't.
[01:25:07.160 --> 01:25:08.160]   Okay.
[01:25:08.160 --> 01:25:10.160]   So this is a portion of the Fine program.
[01:25:10.160 --> 01:25:12.160]   It's brought to you by Audible.com.
[01:25:12.160 --> 01:25:13.160]   Oh, we love Audible.
[01:25:13.160 --> 01:25:16.600]   It is the ultimate in audio bookstores.
[01:25:16.600 --> 01:25:17.600]   First thing I do, what do you think?
[01:25:17.600 --> 01:25:18.600]   What do you think?
[01:25:18.600 --> 01:25:22.280]   The first thing I do is I put my Audible app on here, but then I download all my books
[01:25:22.280 --> 01:25:26.840]   on here because I cannot live without my Audible books on my iPhone.
[01:25:26.840 --> 01:25:30.960]   My iPad, my Android phone.
[01:25:30.960 --> 01:25:31.960]   That app is so great.
[01:25:31.960 --> 01:25:33.120]   The Audible app.
[01:25:33.120 --> 01:25:34.120]   I have...
[01:25:34.120 --> 01:25:38.000]   I've been an Audible subscriber since 2000.
[01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:39.000]   The O.O.
[01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:43.480]   Since practically the turn of the century and have hundreds of books on there and I just
[01:25:43.480 --> 01:25:45.880]   love it and there's hundreds more.
[01:25:45.880 --> 01:25:46.880]   The variety...
[01:25:46.880 --> 01:25:47.880]   Sakuable.
[01:25:47.880 --> 01:25:48.880]   Sakuable.
[01:25:48.880 --> 01:25:51.400]   I have...
[01:25:51.400 --> 01:25:56.560]   I finished the Game of Thrones, The Clash of Kings before the show because I didn't want
[01:25:56.560 --> 01:25:57.560]   to...
[01:25:57.560 --> 01:25:58.960]   I wanted to read it before I saw it.
[01:25:58.960 --> 01:25:59.960]   Really?
[01:25:59.960 --> 01:26:00.960]   Does that make it better?
[01:26:00.960 --> 01:26:01.960]   Yeah.
[01:26:01.960 --> 01:26:02.960]   I don't...
[01:26:02.960 --> 01:26:04.360]   I really wanted to ruin it.
[01:26:04.360 --> 01:26:07.120]   I watched Game of Thrones on Sunday and I thought, "If you didn't read the book, would
[01:26:07.120 --> 01:26:08.720]   you even have any idea what's going on?
[01:26:08.720 --> 01:26:10.440]   There's a lot of going on, a lot of people.
[01:26:10.440 --> 01:26:12.280]   You couldn't follow that.
[01:26:12.280 --> 01:26:13.280]   You think not?
[01:26:13.280 --> 01:26:16.880]   I had some issues, but thankfully Tom filled me in.
[01:26:16.880 --> 01:26:18.080]   So you didn't read the book?
[01:26:18.080 --> 01:26:20.440]   No, but there was characters that came in and I'm...
[01:26:20.440 --> 01:26:21.440]   It's like, "Who's he?
[01:26:21.440 --> 01:26:22.440]   Where'd he come from?"
[01:26:22.440 --> 01:26:23.440]   What's that?
[01:26:23.440 --> 01:26:27.880]   If you read it beforehand, your brain can't stop by saying, "Oh, well, it looks like the
[01:26:27.880 --> 01:26:37.280]   hour gone was part of the raiding party after all."
[01:26:37.280 --> 01:26:40.920]   I thought, "Wow, they went through half the book in one hour.
[01:26:40.920 --> 01:26:42.760]   They really skim along."
[01:26:42.760 --> 01:26:45.360]   So if you want really all the color and the detail and...
[01:26:45.360 --> 01:26:46.760]   Oh, it's just a beautiful book.
[01:26:46.760 --> 01:26:47.760]   That's a great one.
[01:26:47.760 --> 01:26:50.160]   But I know Andy, you've got a book for us.
[01:26:50.160 --> 01:26:53.160]   I got one that I'm really, really enjoying.
[01:26:53.160 --> 01:26:57.360]   There's some odd punctuation here.
[01:26:57.360 --> 01:27:01.120]   The title of the book is "Toughs, Hit."
[01:27:01.120 --> 01:27:03.560]   Life advice from the Fat Lazy Slob who did good.
[01:27:03.560 --> 01:27:11.360]   It is a memoir by Kevin Smith of Chasing Amy Fame, of Clerk's Fame, of Smotcast fame.
[01:27:11.360 --> 01:27:12.360]   And it is...
[01:27:12.360 --> 01:27:15.560]   I think it's sort of been mislabeled.
[01:27:15.560 --> 01:27:19.520]   It's being promoted as sort of a health self-help guide to saying how to motivate yourself and
[01:27:19.520 --> 01:27:21.960]   find your dream and live the life you want to live.
[01:27:21.960 --> 01:27:26.920]   There really isn't much about this book that would land him a spot on Oprah, even on the
[01:27:26.920 --> 01:27:29.480]   own network where there's no audience.
[01:27:29.480 --> 01:27:34.440]   It really is like, if you're a fan of his work, you'll find that this is sort of like
[01:27:34.440 --> 01:27:41.560]   a greatest hits package of his Q&A sessions, his podcasts, his interviews.
[01:27:41.560 --> 01:27:45.640]   He tells some stories you've heard before, some stories you've never heard before, but
[01:27:45.640 --> 01:27:47.760]   it's all being read by him.
[01:27:47.760 --> 01:27:51.680]   And he sometimes goes off the script to sort of give you sort of parenthetical stuff.
[01:27:51.680 --> 01:27:55.000]   So that's one advantage of doing the Audible book compared to the print book.
[01:27:55.000 --> 01:27:56.000]   Yeah.
[01:27:56.000 --> 01:27:58.800]   He has a hell of a great storyteller.
[01:27:58.800 --> 01:28:01.840]   I was a fan of his from his early films.
[01:28:01.840 --> 01:28:06.400]   And after watching his later films, you sort of come to appreciate that he's just a guy
[01:28:06.400 --> 01:28:10.680]   who's really good at telling stories and that movies just happen to be the first outlet
[01:28:10.680 --> 01:28:14.480]   that he used to use that skill with.
[01:28:14.480 --> 01:28:19.320]   And to be honest, there are parts of it which will sort of feel like a kick in the pants
[01:28:19.320 --> 01:28:23.040]   because he does talk about how he was at a certain point of his life where he's like,
[01:28:23.040 --> 01:28:27.600]   you know what, even if I go $27,000 in debt making this movie, I want to be a loser who
[01:28:27.600 --> 01:28:31.160]   has a completed film, a completed film of the closet.
[01:28:31.160 --> 01:28:35.600]   I don't want to be a loser who just stayed a loser into his 30s and 40s.
[01:28:35.600 --> 01:28:39.440]   So it's entertaining, it's instructive, but start to finish it.
[01:28:39.440 --> 01:28:42.880]   It is not one of those circle the neighborhood for a couple of times because you want to
[01:28:42.880 --> 01:28:44.800]   get to the end of this part of the story.
[01:28:44.800 --> 01:28:45.800]   I love it.
[01:28:45.800 --> 01:28:46.800]   I'm about three quarters of the way through it right now.
[01:28:46.800 --> 01:28:51.240]   I'm glad that early on, you do get to hear the story, an entire chapter of working with
[01:28:51.240 --> 01:28:52.240]   Bruce Willis.
[01:28:52.240 --> 01:28:53.240]   Oh my goodness.
[01:28:53.240 --> 01:28:57.040]   So he told that story at Macworld.
[01:28:57.040 --> 01:29:00.800]   You know, it was that's worth the whole book.
[01:29:00.800 --> 01:29:02.600]   I mean, it was so funny.
[01:29:02.600 --> 01:29:05.360]   Anyway, and I'm sure there's a strong language throughout.
[01:29:05.360 --> 01:29:08.920]   So this is not one for what we don't like strong language.
[01:29:08.920 --> 01:29:11.600]   The fact that the title is not exactly tough.
[01:29:11.600 --> 01:29:16.960]   Tough spit, life advice from a fat list and then a space then the word hit away.
[01:29:16.960 --> 01:29:17.960]   Well, they did.
[01:29:17.960 --> 01:29:18.960]   They did edit it that way.
[01:29:18.960 --> 01:29:26.000]   They choose an honor of pendulette who every time he has to talk about his show, his cable
[01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:29.360]   show, he always refers to as bulls hit.
[01:29:29.360 --> 01:29:30.840]   Oh, that's good.
[01:29:30.840 --> 01:29:33.840]   So he can get away with it without getting the explicit tag.
[01:29:33.840 --> 01:29:36.360]   This is tough hit.
[01:29:36.360 --> 01:29:37.560]   It's all about this.
[01:29:37.560 --> 01:29:38.560]   A labification.
[01:29:38.560 --> 01:29:39.560]   Yes, exactly.
[01:29:39.560 --> 01:29:40.560]   Yes.
[01:29:40.560 --> 01:29:44.400]   You just get squeaked in just you found that top corner of the net and you got your goal
[01:29:44.400 --> 01:29:45.400]   in there.
[01:29:45.400 --> 01:29:46.400]   Nothing but net on that one.
[01:29:46.400 --> 01:29:47.400]   Great.
[01:29:47.400 --> 01:29:48.400]   Great one.
[01:29:48.400 --> 01:29:50.840]   So the past six months, there you go.
[01:29:50.840 --> 01:29:51.840]   Can't wait.
[01:29:51.840 --> 01:29:52.840]   So here's the deal.
[01:29:52.840 --> 01:29:56.560]   You get this for free if you go to audible.com/macbreak you'll sign up for the gold account.
[01:29:56.560 --> 01:30:03.440]   You get a credit pick any book, any credit one credit book and you're going to love it.
[01:30:03.440 --> 01:30:08.640]   And you can cancel anytime, pay no price and keep the book forever.
[01:30:08.640 --> 01:30:09.640]   So it's a free book.
[01:30:09.640 --> 01:30:10.640]   It's a good deal.
[01:30:10.640 --> 01:30:11.640]   I have a feeling you're going to stick around.
[01:30:11.640 --> 01:30:14.440]   In fact, I got a tweet from somebody said, you know, you really shouldn't be doing audible
[01:30:14.440 --> 01:30:15.440]   ads.
[01:30:15.440 --> 01:30:16.440]   I used to listen to your podcast till I found audible.
[01:30:16.440 --> 01:30:18.160]   Now I don't listen to your shows at all.
[01:30:18.160 --> 01:30:19.160]   I think that's the point.
[01:30:19.160 --> 01:30:20.160]   There's a little risk.
[01:30:20.160 --> 01:30:21.560]   There's a little risk here, but I don't care.
[01:30:21.560 --> 01:30:24.200]   I love audible and I'm glad to tell anybody about it.
[01:30:24.200 --> 01:30:28.200]   Plays on every device you've got and it's easy to use and you get the book right away,
[01:30:28.200 --> 01:30:30.240]   which is a real plus for me.
[01:30:30.240 --> 01:30:34.280]   Audible.com/macbreak try it free right now.
[01:30:34.280 --> 01:30:36.040]   Tell them Leo sent you.
[01:30:36.040 --> 01:30:37.040]   Who?
[01:30:37.040 --> 01:30:38.040]   All right.
[01:30:38.040 --> 01:30:40.320]   Let's get our picks and we got to do this fairly quick.
[01:30:40.320 --> 01:30:45.000]   We're going to start with Adam Anks of tittbits.com.
[01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:47.320]   That's a good pick right there.
[01:30:47.320 --> 01:30:48.320]   You must subscribe.
[01:30:48.320 --> 01:30:49.320]   We try.
[01:30:49.320 --> 01:30:50.320]   We try.
[01:30:50.320 --> 01:30:51.320]   Yes.
[01:30:51.320 --> 01:30:55.560]   Well, my pick this week is Cloudpole 2.0 from Golden Hill Software.
[01:30:55.560 --> 01:31:02.960]   What Cloudpole does is that it backs up all your data in Google to your Mac.
[01:31:02.960 --> 01:31:06.960]   Let's face it, your calendar is probably not a huge deal.
[01:31:06.960 --> 01:31:09.240]   You can sync those to iCal or whatever.
[01:31:09.240 --> 01:31:12.840]   Your contacts, again, there's ways of getting those synced.
[01:31:12.840 --> 01:31:16.960]   Gmail, probably you want to be using Apple Mail or another iNAP client.
[01:31:16.960 --> 01:31:23.600]   But the real trick is Google Docs that at this point, some people have a ton of Google
[01:31:23.600 --> 01:31:28.440]   Docs and those things do not exist anywhere else.
[01:31:28.440 --> 01:31:33.640]   Cloudpole, what it does is you give it your Google account credentials so that it can log
[01:31:33.640 --> 01:31:39.440]   in and it goes and this constantly looks at your Google account and sucks in all the
[01:31:39.440 --> 01:31:40.440]   data.
[01:31:40.440 --> 01:31:44.920]   For Google Docs, it transfers documents to Microsoft Word documents, spreadsheets to
[01:31:44.920 --> 01:31:50.640]   Excel documents, presentations to PowerPoint and so on.
[01:31:50.640 --> 01:31:51.640]   It brings in everything.
[01:31:51.640 --> 01:31:55.360]   If you have other types of documents you've uploaded to Google Docs over time, it'll bring
[01:31:55.360 --> 01:31:56.880]   those in.
[01:31:56.880 --> 01:32:01.880]   I actually do recommend that you use Apple Mail instead of Cloudpole for backing up
[01:32:01.880 --> 01:32:07.560]   your Gmail, if you use Gmail's web interface, because Cloudpole 2.0 is really, really slow
[01:32:07.560 --> 01:32:11.880]   to bring in your first iMap backup if you do turn that on.
[01:32:11.880 --> 01:32:19.400]   I mean, I have 400,000 messages and it took 10 days to bring in my entire mail store.
[01:32:19.400 --> 01:32:23.720]   But for documents, it's quick, it works, they're on your Mac, it even saves versions.
[01:32:23.720 --> 01:32:27.800]   So if you change a file on Google Docs, you can actually see the different versions in
[01:32:27.800 --> 01:32:30.480]   Cloudpole on your Mac and get them back as different versions.
[01:32:30.480 --> 01:32:35.480]   So it's a brilliant little app and for anyone who's doing significant work in Google Docs,
[01:32:35.480 --> 01:32:39.520]   25 bucks is well worth it for the peace of mind and getting that actual backup locally
[01:32:39.520 --> 01:32:41.360]   where you can always get at it.
[01:32:41.360 --> 01:32:43.480]   We should point out that Google does offer this for free.
[01:32:43.480 --> 01:32:47.120]   I mean, they're using a Google API, but it's just a lot of, it's a pain to do it because
[01:32:47.120 --> 01:32:51.240]   you have to do it one by one if you go to google.com/takeout.
[01:32:51.240 --> 01:32:56.720]   This is basically, Cloudpole is using this API to pull all this stuff down.
[01:32:56.720 --> 01:33:02.520]   But if you go to takeout, you can create an archive of all your data.
[01:33:02.520 --> 01:33:04.920]   You just can't do anything with it.
[01:33:04.920 --> 01:33:06.760]   And Cloudpole is doing it constantly.
[01:33:06.760 --> 01:33:07.760]   Right, that's the other thing.
[01:33:07.760 --> 01:33:08.760]   It's every hour.
[01:33:08.760 --> 01:33:11.480]   It's like time machine for Google Docs.
[01:33:11.480 --> 01:33:13.840]   Yes, I think it's a very, very good idea.
[01:33:13.840 --> 01:33:17.280]   Cloudpole, goldenhillsoftware.com.
[01:33:17.280 --> 01:33:18.680]   Thank you, Adam.
[01:33:18.680 --> 01:33:20.920]   Alex Lindsey, your pick of the week.
[01:33:20.920 --> 01:33:22.720]   Can you just do one?
[01:33:22.720 --> 01:33:23.720]   Okay, fine.
[01:33:23.720 --> 01:33:24.720]   Save it for next week.
[01:33:24.720 --> 01:33:25.720]   You don't have to use everything all at once.
[01:33:25.720 --> 01:33:26.720]   I don't remember.
[01:33:26.720 --> 01:33:27.720]   Next week.
[01:33:27.720 --> 01:33:28.720]   Do I need to give you a camera?
[01:33:28.720 --> 01:33:29.720]   Yeah, you need a camera camera.
[01:33:29.720 --> 01:33:30.720]   Alright, hold on.
[01:33:30.720 --> 01:33:31.720]   I agree with this.
[01:33:31.720 --> 01:33:32.720]   You can do both.
[01:33:32.720 --> 01:33:33.720]   But just do them quick.
[01:33:33.720 --> 01:33:34.720]   I love this one.
[01:33:34.720 --> 01:33:35.720]   We picked this.
[01:33:35.720 --> 01:33:37.760]   This was Sarah's app cap on iPad today.
[01:33:37.760 --> 01:33:38.760]   Fantastic.
[01:33:38.760 --> 01:33:39.760]   Fantastic.
[01:33:39.760 --> 01:33:40.760]   Can you see me?
[01:33:40.760 --> 01:33:41.760]   Hold on.
[01:33:41.760 --> 01:33:42.760]   Working on it.
[01:33:42.760 --> 01:33:43.760]   So whilst you're talking, I'll talk about the other one.
[01:33:43.760 --> 01:33:44.760]   Yeah.
[01:33:44.760 --> 01:33:46.400]   I just got this and this is the Mophie Power Station.
[01:33:46.400 --> 01:33:47.400]   Oh, that's...
[01:33:47.400 --> 01:33:48.400]   I thought it was a case.
[01:33:48.400 --> 01:33:49.400]   Oh, so it's not a case.
[01:33:49.400 --> 01:33:52.320]   And here's why it's useful because you can plug it into your iPad.
[01:33:52.320 --> 01:33:53.480]   And it's enough to juice it.
[01:33:53.480 --> 01:33:54.480]   Yeah.
[01:33:54.480 --> 01:33:57.560]   So it's 4,000 milliamps.
[01:33:57.560 --> 01:33:58.560]   And it is...
[01:33:58.560 --> 01:34:01.960]   I have to admit, I spend a lot of time on the road, as you might know.
[01:34:01.960 --> 01:34:04.200]   And so I have two cases that I usually have.
[01:34:04.200 --> 01:34:06.200]   And one, they're charging right now because I'm about to go on the road again.
[01:34:06.200 --> 01:34:10.200]   But anyway, that's one.
[01:34:10.200 --> 01:34:11.200]   Mophie Power Station.
[01:34:11.200 --> 01:34:12.200]   Power Station.
[01:34:12.200 --> 01:34:14.640]   We have the overhead here in one of mine.
[01:34:14.640 --> 01:34:15.640]   This is something...
[01:34:15.640 --> 01:34:16.640]   A little bit more.
[01:34:16.640 --> 01:34:17.640]   There we go.
[01:34:17.640 --> 01:34:18.640]   Oh, yeah.
[01:34:18.640 --> 01:34:19.640]   Look at that.
[01:34:19.640 --> 01:34:20.640]   Paper.
[01:34:20.640 --> 01:34:21.640]   So this is paper.
[01:34:21.640 --> 01:34:22.640]   And it's made by...
[01:34:22.640 --> 01:34:23.640]   Is it 53 by 53?
[01:34:23.640 --> 01:34:26.440]   53 by 53.
[01:34:26.440 --> 01:34:27.440]   And it is...
[01:34:27.440 --> 01:34:30.680]   So it's a free download, but then you have to buy the pens.
[01:34:30.680 --> 01:34:31.680]   Which are going on each.
[01:34:31.680 --> 01:34:32.680]   Yeah.
[01:34:32.680 --> 01:34:34.160]   Although if you get all of them and think it's 8 bucks for the full set.
[01:34:34.160 --> 01:34:35.160]   Yeah, it's fine.
[01:34:35.160 --> 01:34:38.800]   It's a $8 app because the truth is you're going to have to buy the pens.
[01:34:38.800 --> 01:34:41.200]   The performance on this is outstanding.
[01:34:41.200 --> 01:34:42.200]   I mean, so you can see...
[01:34:42.200 --> 01:34:43.200]   And it's beautiful.
[01:34:43.200 --> 01:34:45.800]   So you can sit here and draw like this and I can set it up here.
[01:34:45.800 --> 01:34:47.840]   And then I can figure it because we can hardly see that.
[01:34:47.840 --> 01:34:50.040]   It's very light.
[01:34:50.040 --> 01:34:51.040]   Drawing.
[01:34:51.040 --> 01:34:52.040]   Or colorful.
[01:34:52.040 --> 01:34:53.040]   Or thicker.
[01:34:53.040 --> 01:34:54.040]   Oh, yeah.
[01:34:54.040 --> 01:34:55.040]   So I'll use something more.
[01:34:55.040 --> 01:34:56.040]   So that...
[01:34:56.040 --> 01:34:57.040]   Yeah, now we can see it.
[01:34:57.040 --> 01:34:58.040]   And see, notice how it gets fat at the end?
[01:34:58.040 --> 01:35:00.600]   Yeah, it feels like it's pressure sensitive.
[01:35:00.600 --> 01:35:01.600]   I don't know how they're doing that.
[01:35:01.600 --> 01:35:03.400]   It's a very lively line.
[01:35:03.400 --> 01:35:04.400]   It's amazing.
[01:35:04.400 --> 01:35:05.400]   Yeah, it's really...
[01:35:05.400 --> 01:35:08.400]   Like a little jet.
[01:35:08.400 --> 01:35:10.400]   So anyway, so the...
[01:35:10.400 --> 01:35:11.400]   Little missile.
[01:35:11.400 --> 01:35:12.400]   There you go.
[01:35:12.400 --> 01:35:18.040]   So anyway, it is just one of the most fluid ones that I've played with.
[01:35:18.040 --> 01:35:21.040]   And what I'm doing, the pen that I'm using right now comes free with it.
[01:35:21.040 --> 01:35:22.040]   So you can do little sketches.
[01:35:22.040 --> 01:35:23.440]   And then you've got all kinds of...
[01:35:23.440 --> 01:35:24.640]   You've got a pen.
[01:35:24.640 --> 01:35:28.400]   And one of the things that I'm really touch you about is A, that you don't see bisecting
[01:35:28.400 --> 01:35:30.800]   of the lines with a drawing app.
[01:35:30.800 --> 01:35:34.160]   And B, how quickly is it going to follow my finger or my pen or whatever?
[01:35:34.160 --> 01:35:37.720]   And this performance is really, really good.
[01:35:37.720 --> 01:35:39.920]   And then you slide this up to get other ones.
[01:35:39.920 --> 01:35:42.080]   This is kind of a watercolor.
[01:35:42.080 --> 01:35:45.200]   So anyway, I love it.
[01:35:45.200 --> 01:35:46.600]   It's very, very cool.
[01:35:46.600 --> 01:35:47.600]   So that's it.
[01:35:47.600 --> 01:35:48.600]   That was good.
[01:35:48.600 --> 01:35:49.600]   You did two...
[01:35:49.600 --> 01:35:50.600]   Look at that.
[01:35:50.600 --> 01:35:54.760]   Two in the time that would take a normal mortal to do a half.
[01:35:54.760 --> 01:35:56.320]   And you even did a free product.
[01:35:56.320 --> 01:35:57.320]   Aren't you proud of me?
[01:35:57.320 --> 01:35:58.320]   I'm impressed.
[01:35:58.320 --> 01:35:59.320]   But there was one that I was going to show.
[01:35:59.320 --> 01:36:00.320]   It was a little more expensive.
[01:36:00.320 --> 01:36:03.080]   Well, we could say the one Alex products for another time.
[01:36:03.080 --> 01:36:06.720]   You did mention the, you know, this expensive Thunderbolt drive.
[01:36:06.720 --> 01:36:08.920]   Andy, you're not going to pick up the week, sir.
[01:36:08.920 --> 01:36:12.280]   My pick of the week is a really cool app that was fun to research.
[01:36:12.280 --> 01:36:17.200]   It's Prime Motion X, the people who make my favorite GPS app, navigation app for the
[01:36:17.200 --> 01:36:18.200]   iPhone.
[01:36:18.200 --> 01:36:20.680]   It's called Motion X Sleep.
[01:36:20.680 --> 01:36:22.520]   And it does two things.
[01:36:22.520 --> 01:36:24.040]   It does two things.
[01:36:24.040 --> 01:36:25.560]   Number one, it's a pedometer app.
[01:36:25.560 --> 01:36:30.160]   So if you want to use it to try to make your goal of hitting, of walking 10,000 paces,
[01:36:30.160 --> 01:36:35.160]   so at the day you can do that.
[01:36:35.160 --> 01:36:37.800]   But the really cool thing is that it is an alarm clock program that waits to listen to
[01:36:37.800 --> 01:36:40.120]   see, well, what is his periods of activity while he's sleeping?
[01:36:40.120 --> 01:36:41.880]   What is his periods of actual restfulness?
[01:36:41.880 --> 01:36:46.440]   I'm going to wake him up when at the time when he can be optimally feel refreshed when
[01:36:46.440 --> 01:36:47.440]   he wakes up.
[01:36:47.440 --> 01:36:51.320]   And you can do that by either you can actually wear it on an arm on an arm band for the first
[01:36:51.320 --> 01:36:56.320]   few nights actually kept my iPhone like in the pocket of my pajamas when I was sleeping.
[01:36:56.320 --> 01:37:01.280]   But actually if you just keep it like next to you on the bed, the rocking motion of like
[01:37:01.280 --> 01:37:04.520]   when you're just sort of tossing and turning, that's enough to sort of tell it, okay, there's
[01:37:04.520 --> 01:37:06.680]   motion going on.
[01:37:06.680 --> 01:37:08.560]   It really does work incredibly well.
[01:37:08.560 --> 01:37:11.040]   It's easy to track how you're sleeping.
[01:37:11.040 --> 01:37:15.080]   You can tell it how long you wish to sleep, how much restful sleep you want to get.
[01:37:15.080 --> 01:37:16.560]   And it really does work.
[01:37:16.560 --> 01:37:19.920]   Now I've only been using it for about a week and a half, two weeks now.
[01:37:19.920 --> 01:37:23.280]   I came out just a couple of weeks ago.
[01:37:23.280 --> 01:37:30.000]   But I have to say that the nights when I wake up because the alarm woke me up at the time
[01:37:30.000 --> 01:37:34.920]   that I have to wake up, there was a time when that's the only way I'd wake up and I said,
[01:37:34.920 --> 01:37:37.480]   oh God, I can't believe I got to get out of bed right now.
[01:37:37.480 --> 01:37:41.760]   There are nights when I'm actually sleeping less than I did then, but still feeling great.
[01:37:41.760 --> 01:37:43.240]   Let's start making waffles.
[01:37:43.240 --> 01:37:44.680]   No, let's make waffle and pancakes.
[01:37:44.680 --> 01:37:46.440]   No, waffles, pancakes and an omelet.
[01:37:46.440 --> 01:37:48.320]   Great, let's go, go, go.
[01:37:48.320 --> 01:37:50.480]   So it's 99 cents.
[01:37:50.480 --> 01:37:57.480]   It's definitely worthwhile a try, give it a week, see how well it clicks into how you
[01:37:57.480 --> 01:38:00.400]   spend your resting and waking moments.
[01:38:00.400 --> 01:38:04.880]   And you might be a little bit surprised at how big of an impact it'll have by the end
[01:38:04.880 --> 01:38:05.880]   of the week.
[01:38:05.880 --> 01:38:09.920]   It's a lot cheaper than the up band, which does also uses motion X, which is 99 bucks
[01:38:09.920 --> 01:38:10.920]   and broke.
[01:38:10.920 --> 01:38:15.880]   Plus, the only tip is you probably want to have it plugged in.
[01:38:15.880 --> 01:38:18.560]   You want to have your phone plugged in and charging while it's there.
[01:38:18.560 --> 01:38:23.240]   That's why I unfortunately have a power strip on the shelf on my headboard, so it's no
[01:38:23.240 --> 01:38:24.240]   problem there.
[01:38:24.240 --> 01:38:26.880]   And it will burn through some battery while you're sleeping.
[01:38:26.880 --> 01:38:30.800]   We showed an iPad today and I'd refer you to it, the Renew Alarm Clock, which does the
[01:38:30.800 --> 01:38:31.800]   same thing.
[01:38:31.800 --> 01:38:33.040]   It actually is a little bit more sophisticated.
[01:38:33.040 --> 01:38:38.000]   It's using a sonar to actually, what was it?
[01:38:38.000 --> 01:38:42.360]   It was an ultrasound to track your breathing and your movements, but you have to buy a
[01:38:42.360 --> 01:38:46.960]   $200 alarm clock and then plug the iPhone into it or the iPad and then it has the software
[01:38:46.960 --> 01:38:47.960]   and all that stuff.
[01:38:47.960 --> 01:38:51.360]   So how does it know to go into married couple mode and not to...
[01:38:51.360 --> 01:38:52.800]   It looks at whose closest.
[01:38:52.800 --> 01:38:53.800]   It looks at whose closest.
[01:38:53.800 --> 01:38:55.920]   That's why it turns on the voice recorder.
[01:38:55.920 --> 01:38:56.920]   Only one of you gets it.
[01:38:56.920 --> 01:38:57.920]   But it's not going to.
[01:38:57.920 --> 01:39:03.040]   But having worn a bunch of this stuff in the past, it's kind of distracting and annoying.
[01:39:03.040 --> 01:39:07.120]   So it's nice to just have the clock be watching you.
[01:39:07.120 --> 01:39:08.760]   But at $200 it's a little pricey.
[01:39:08.760 --> 01:39:10.280]   So that's the Renew Clock.
[01:39:10.280 --> 01:39:12.120]   Watch iPad today because we don't all pick.
[01:39:12.120 --> 01:39:15.200]   Hey Andy and I want to thank you Chicago Suntimes.
[01:39:15.200 --> 01:39:18.440]   His website www.cwob.com.
[01:39:18.440 --> 01:39:22.680]   Great to have you on board and your little squirrel friend.
[01:39:22.680 --> 01:39:23.680]   Research Sun.
[01:39:23.680 --> 01:39:24.680]   Research.
[01:39:24.680 --> 01:39:25.680]   Research.
[01:39:25.680 --> 01:39:26.680]   Adam, thanks.
[01:39:26.680 --> 01:39:28.800]   And Tanya, do that fantastic thing.
[01:39:28.800 --> 01:39:31.280]   We call TID bits and then been doing it for a long time.
[01:39:31.280 --> 01:39:33.640]   T-I-D-B-I-T-S.com.
[01:39:33.640 --> 01:39:34.640]   It's free.
[01:39:34.640 --> 01:39:35.880]   You might as well get it.
[01:39:35.880 --> 01:39:37.280]   I don't know.
[01:39:37.280 --> 01:39:38.280]   Add supported media.
[01:39:38.280 --> 01:39:39.840]   How does that work?
[01:39:39.840 --> 01:39:40.840]   It's never been.
[01:39:40.840 --> 01:39:42.680]   We've also switched to...
[01:39:42.680 --> 01:39:44.080]   Add supported and members.
[01:39:44.080 --> 01:39:46.040]   Yeah, and I'm really glad you did that.
[01:39:46.040 --> 01:39:48.040]   Pick an apple up there, right there.
[01:39:48.040 --> 01:39:49.120]   It's becoming TID bits member.
[01:39:49.120 --> 01:39:53.400]   We've got close to 2,000 members and that's huge for us.
[01:39:53.400 --> 01:39:56.120]   Yes, I'm so glad you did that.
[01:39:56.120 --> 01:39:59.280]   And we have, in fact that was a pick I think a couple of weeks ago.
[01:39:59.280 --> 01:40:00.280]   Was it Andy?
[01:40:00.280 --> 01:40:01.280]   Thank you.
[01:40:01.280 --> 01:40:02.280]   Yeah.
[01:40:02.280 --> 01:40:03.280]   Join.
[01:40:03.280 --> 01:40:04.280]   You don't have to, but do.
[01:40:04.280 --> 01:40:05.280]   TID bits.com.
[01:40:05.280 --> 01:40:06.280]   Thank you Adam.
[01:40:06.280 --> 01:40:07.280]   Great to have you here.
[01:40:07.280 --> 01:40:08.280]   Really appreciate it.
[01:40:08.280 --> 01:40:09.280]   Always.
[01:40:09.280 --> 01:40:11.360]   Alex Lindsey, don't be a stranger.
[01:40:11.360 --> 01:40:12.360]   He's traveling through.
[01:40:12.360 --> 01:40:14.240]   He thought he'd sit down for a minute.
[01:40:14.240 --> 01:40:16.200]   Yeah, you're not on next week, are you?
[01:40:16.200 --> 01:40:17.200]   He's going somewhere else.
[01:40:17.200 --> 01:40:18.200]   Where are you going next week?
[01:40:18.200 --> 01:40:19.200]   I'm going to be in New York tomorrow.
[01:40:19.200 --> 01:40:20.200]   Oh, that's nice.
[01:40:20.200 --> 01:40:21.200]   That'll be fun.
[01:40:21.200 --> 01:40:24.800]   PIXACORA.com for that great guild of multimedia artists who work and learn together.
[01:40:24.800 --> 01:40:27.480]   PIXACORA.tv for the podcast.
[01:40:27.480 --> 01:40:29.120]   Follow Alex on Twitter, Alex Lindsey.
[01:40:29.120 --> 01:40:30.480]   You can see where he is this week.
[01:40:30.480 --> 01:40:33.160]   We actually have some new podcasts coming out next month.
[01:40:33.160 --> 01:40:34.160]   What's that?
[01:40:34.160 --> 01:40:35.320]   We're going to do a variety of different ones.
[01:40:35.320 --> 01:40:37.560]   We're going to rebuild up your media tech.
[01:40:37.560 --> 01:40:39.440]   We're also possibly doing one on livestreaming.
[01:40:39.440 --> 01:40:40.920]   We're trying to sort out that piece.
[01:40:40.920 --> 01:40:46.080]   And then finally, one on, really like web presence, you know, because we do a lot of
[01:40:46.080 --> 01:40:47.080]   that.
[01:40:47.080 --> 01:40:50.000]   So figuring out how to rig up your system.
[01:40:50.000 --> 01:40:51.400]   So thank you for being here.
[01:40:51.400 --> 01:40:52.400]   Thank you all for joining us.
[01:40:52.400 --> 01:40:57.640]   We do this show every 11 a.m. Pacific, 2 p.m. Eastern time every Tuesday on twit.tv.
[01:40:57.640 --> 01:41:01.200]   But you don't have to watch live because we make audio and video available as you know
[01:41:01.200 --> 01:41:02.200]   for download.
[01:41:02.200 --> 01:41:03.200]   Just subscribe and join.
[01:41:03.200 --> 01:41:06.480]   And of course, if you're into the iPad, I mentioned a couple of times with Sarah Lane
[01:41:06.480 --> 01:41:07.920]   and I do iPad today.
[01:41:07.920 --> 01:41:11.200]   It's Thursday afternoon, 130 Pacific, 430 Eastern time.
[01:41:11.200 --> 01:41:12.720]   And that's a great show if you're an iPad user.
[01:41:12.720 --> 01:41:14.240]   But we do a lot of iOS stuff.
[01:41:14.240 --> 01:41:18.560]   Sometimes we'll even do stuff that's not iPad specific, but iPhone specific.
[01:41:18.560 --> 01:41:19.560]   Thanks for joining us.
[01:41:19.560 --> 01:41:20.560]   Now get back to work.
[01:41:20.560 --> 01:41:21.320]   Work time is over.
[01:41:21.320 --> 01:41:31.800]   [MUSIC]
