[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly. Renee Richie is here, Andy and not go to.
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000]   It's kind of a year-end episode. We're gonna look back at what was a terrible year.
[00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.000]   I think we all agree. 2020, but turned out pretty good for Apple.
[00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.000]   It began with the first tremors of COVID-19 early on in January
[00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.000]   and ended with Apple Silicon and an amazing M1 chip.
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:33.000]   Apple's no good, very bad, but somewhat productive year next.
[00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000]   Podcasts you love from people you trust.
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.000]   This is Twit.
[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:51.000]   This is Mac Break Weekly, episode 746, recorded Tuesday, December 29, 2020, the year-end review.
[00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly, the show we get together with Mac.
[00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:01.000]   My Mac friends, my little Mac friends, and talk about the latest news from Apple.
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000]   We've lost one of our little Mac friends to the fruit company.
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:12.000]   Yes. Lori Gill has got a much better job writing for Apple's YouTube channel,
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000]   so it's just the three amigos this week.
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000]   Andy and I go good to see you. Happy holidays. Do you have a good Christmas?
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:26.000]   Oh, had a great Christmas. As a matter of fact, because of the reduced circumstances,
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.000]   I realized that, well, here's how much money I would normally put in the budget for Christmas
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.000]   because oftentimes it involves, I'm going to go to New York and spend the day with friends
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.000]   and see the fifth dunaries.
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:42.000]   I decided to spend one third of that amount on the biggest Christmas feast I have ever put together.
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000]   But it was just you all by yourself eating a giant feast?
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:54.000]   Well, that was the plan. For breakfast, I had many pastries that I bought at the market.
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   For lunch, I made myself a salmon steak with a quinoa and walnut salad.
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   So, what did I trust? Oh, of course.
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   Perfect. Then I had a pork roast I was going to be making for second dinner at 7 or 8.
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   But by 4 or 5 in the afternoon, I had finished cleaning the kitchen.
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   I'd also had the better part of half of a pumpkin pie.
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   He's passed out drooling on the tree.
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   Luckily, I still had half of a pizza from my Christmas Eve pizza left over.
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   I think I've just got to be on the sofa, I'm going to eat pizza, and I'm going to binge watch.
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   I'll ask you about your TV viewing over the holidays just a second.
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   But we also want to say hello to Renee Ritchie, amigo number trace.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   Hello, Renee.
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   Hello, Leo. You haven't lost me to big fruit, and you won't, not even in the season finale of 2020.
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   Oh, my God.
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   And I just say, I really hope there's no after credit scene.
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   You think that Linda Carter showing up for no apparent reason with a brand new name,
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   Listeria? No, it wasn't Listeria.
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   Asteria wasn't a perfect...
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   You can't tell people this, Leo. They haven't seen it yet.
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   They've only like three people can afford it.
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   Spoiler alert.
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   It wasn't a spoiler. It was bizarre.
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   I'm going to say it was a nice touch.
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   So long as it's not like the way that they did, like there was like a monsters reboot
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.000]   where the new Herman Munster takes a job as a waiter,
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   and they serve a table of guests who like all the original cast,
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   and it's just nothing but like lingering tight shots on the former grandpa Munster's like,
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000]   "That person looks familiar for some reason."
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   But we like it when Stanley is like a male man in the background.
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   I think that's great. I think that's great.
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   And I do apologize if that's a spoiler.
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   But on the other hand, it was the worst movie I've ever seen.
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   So can you spoil a truly awful movie?
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   Oh, there's individual tastes or individual tastes.
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   It is. I admit. And I have none because I also think the Mandalorian's kind of dopey.
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   But did you enjoy Wonder Woman, Andy?
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   I haven't seen it yet.
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   Oh, okay.
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   I do have plenty. That's what I was going to see.
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   That's why I had such plans for that night because I had chips and salsa already
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:21.000]   for watching Wonder Woman on Christmas Day at the very, very end of the day.
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:22.000]   You had plans.
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   Well, oh, man.
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:29.000]   It was the first time that I woke up at 4.30 in the morning on Christmas Day
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000]   and I was too excited to go back to sleep.
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   Oh, my God.
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:37.000]   So unfortunately, my plans were foiled because like at 8 p.m.
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   like I turned on Santa Claus, Conker's, the Martians from Mr.
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:43.000]   J. 3000.
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   Okay.
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:45.000]   I fell asleep.
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000]   I didn't wake up again until like 2 a.m.
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   and it was like, oh, damn, we're going to have to see this.
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   Valerie Perrine is in that movie.
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:59.000]   And as you know, John Slanina is one of the last remaining hardcore Valerie Perrine fans.
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:06.000]   Ladies and gentlemen, we are going to talk about Apple stuff today.
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:11.000]   It's going to be kind of a light week because everybody went home for Apple.
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:15.000]   So I thought maybe we just run through some of the highlights of the year.
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   We did a best of already and the weirdest thing about the best of was seeing
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:26.000]   how kind of blissfully ignorant we were in the first couple of months of the year.
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   We had so naive.
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   We had no idea what was coming down the pike here.
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:37.000]   Can I, can I, can I, can I, since we don't have a lot of news, can I take risks just for a second and just say to that point.
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:42.000]   So I'm doing like a, my favorite things of 2020, like YouTube live stream tonight.
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.000]   And so a lot of that is, oh, where did I buy things from?
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:46.000]   Oh, Amazon.
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.000]   So part of it was I'm going to go through like all the Amazon purchases.
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   And of course, they show you the most recent ones first.
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:57.000]   And then you get to like the first week in March and suddenly, okay, I'm on gloves.
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   I want alcohol.
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:05:59.000]   I want thermometer.
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   I want a plonox memory.
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000]   And then like a week before that, you know what?
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.000]   How about like a new camera case and a new pair of walking shoes.
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:11.000]   It was like, oh man, what are, what are, what are cultural archaeologists going to make of this?
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:15.000]   We came down with an illness, whether we got it or not.
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.000]   And a lot of us did and sadly a great many died.
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   That's been a great tragedy in the year.
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000]   And I never want to forget that.
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:29.000]   The problem is that that number is so high that it's not even, we can't wrap our brains around.
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000]   It comes with a statistic, not a tragedy.
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   Yeah.
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000]   One person's a tragedy, 300,000 is a statistic.
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:35.000]   Yeah.
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   That's exactly right.
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.000]   And Russia had their numbers yesterday.
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   They were three times higher than everyone expected.
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000]   And it still sounds like that was an underreporting.
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:43.000]   Yeah.
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:46.000]   So and trying to put a reporter in jail.
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:47.000]   Oh, horrible.
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   Jail for horrible.
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:49.000]   Yeah.
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:53.000]   So China's for collecting the official reporting on.
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:07:01.000]   There is an excellent New Yorker article, which if you've got a little free time in this, you know, week, last week of the year, it'd be worth reading.
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.000]   It's pretty much a book length.
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.000]   It's a three and a half hour audio read.
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:12.000]   So that means it's basically a novella of the history of the coronavirus crisis.
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.000]   That's really interesting.
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.000]   Although maybe it's too soon.
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:17.000]   I don't know.
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:22.000]   We're still in the midst of it, right?
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:29.000]   But we have to admit 2021, 2021, 2021, we'll see what happens.
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:37.000]   Despite all that, in many ways, this was a banner year for Apple.
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:38.000]   For big tech.
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:39.000]   Yeah.
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.000]   Well, big tech profits through the roof.
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:08:01.000]   And that's going to be, I think there'll be a reckoning because, you know, people like Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk rapidly, you know, ascending to the highest wealth of any history entirely on the back of a pandemic is a tragedy in itself.
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:04.000]   But I think what I mean, I don't mean Apple profit wise.
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:09.000]   I mean, Apple seemed to be firing on all cylinders.
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:18.000]   I mean, they ended the year with a release of new computers that just changed everything.
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:19.000]   And it's amazing.
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:20.000]   They were able to develop those.
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:30.000]   Obviously they've been in development for years, but they were able to get those out the door in the worst year in living memory is amazing.
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:35.000]   Yeah, and the fact that they did it so successfully with without any incident whatsoever.
[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:53.000]   It was having a, I don't think anybody would have predicted that it was going to be a disaster, but I don't think anybody also would have predicted that this would have caused no more chaos releasing brand new Max with a brand new type of CPU that not only has never run
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:09:05.000]   Mac OS publicly before, but has never existed before and had this happen without any more hiccups than any conventional major release of annual release of Mac OS.
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:06.000]   That is such an achievement.
[00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:15.000]   Do you think they gained because people were forced to work from home that maybe the engineers were a little heads my head down gets.
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:25.000]   No, I think it's also because when you look at, you know, because there was a lot of really good silicon this year like Nvidia put out ampere, which is their next generation.
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:36.000]   That's a good car AMD has the rise in three and they have big Navi, but they could not ship they could not get cars out the cars they did ship were quickly gobbled up by, you know, by resellers.
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:50.000]   They had a disastrous, disastrous release. I think it's all the more impressive that well, yes, some of the skews were limited quantities and have like a few months out on ordering apple shipped and one where a lot of other big silicon companies couldn't ship almost anything.
[00:09:50.000 --> 00:10:01.000]   Yeah, so not only the design, what will I think go down in history is the most important desktop chip evolution in a very long time.
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:09.000]   They managed to get it out the door in quantities that there was no, it wasn't like the PlayStation five where you would hope to have one buy summer.
[00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:16.000]   If you want to one, you can get one right now. There are a few weeks delays, but you got yours Andy eventually John you got yours.
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:17.000]   John's very happy.
[00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:25.000]   I tried to find a 3090 card yesterday on Amazon and all I had to find was from a store called Sorry for scalping and it was like $3,000.
[00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:33.000]   Well, at least they apologized. Amazon still let them sell it. I mean, speaking of scalping, how much did Wonder Woman cost you?
[00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:42.000]   30. Well, because this is so what happened is unlike Disney and apple, Warner's didn't do an international release for HBO Max.
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:49.000]   It's a US only service and no other company. All the companies they've sold the rights to like here, it's Bell media craves in Canada.
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:57.000]   None of them would pay to stream it because it's a ridiculous amount of money. So we only got an on premium video on demand. So it was 30 bucks for us.
[00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:00.000]   Regardless of the service, I'm so sorry.
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:07.000]   Because that really adds insult to injury because then you have to pay 30 bucks and it's still a terrible movie. It just seems.
[00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:10.000]   Yeah, I'm sorry. I should not rag on this movie.
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:16.000]   No, you're doing it. You're doing a lot of us a favor because if we go into this pre-programmed with, oh, I have no expectations.
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:20.000]   People that have known respect have said that's a terrible movie. All it has to do is be good.
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.000]   And now you're like, oh, my God, that was wonderful.
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:25.000]   Yeah, it's a bit of an uphill climb, but OK.
[00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:35.000]   Actually, when Warner announced they were going to stream everything in 2021, there were a few wags who said, yeah, have you seen what the schedule?
[00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:39.000]   There's streaming it because they know they're not going to get box office anyway.
[00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:46.000]   And the first one was a blockbuster, WW 84. I'm sure they'll make plenty of money on it.
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:53.000]   Not to get too deeply into the weeds, but there have been, if you just watch the insider report, it sounds like their studios are deeply dysfunctional.
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:12:01.000]   Like when you hear about what's been going on, whether you're a Zack Snyder or Joss Whedon person, it just sounds like everybody there is behaving abysmally.
[00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:08.000]   There is no, there are no parents running that studio at all. And so I don't, I, I, they, and they didn't even tell anybody they were doing this.
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:13.000]   So like it's it's owned by AT&T now. It just sounds like this is the worst way to run a studio.
[00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:14.000]   That's what I think happened.
[00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:14.000]   Yeah.
[00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.000]   As opposed to Disney and other places.
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.000]   I think the death star doesn't know what they're doing.
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:30.000]   So we begin 2021 with Apple, of course, Apple, because a lot of manufacturers in China, a lot of customers in China, Apple felt the pinch of COVID-19 early on.
[00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:36.000]   They closed offices and stores on just on February 1st in China.
[00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:44.000]   And immediately, Ming Chico said there will be issues with iPhone production issues, which did materialize by the end of the year.
[00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:54.000]   Was it about a month delay roughly in the release of the iPhone Pro Max and the iPhone Mini?
[00:12:54.000 --> 00:13:02.000]   Here's a, here's a lovely memo from Tim Cook that came out February 17th.
[00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:08.000]   The response, again, February 17th, folks, it's got to underline that.
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:21.000]   There's, they're talking, he's talking about how it's going to hit us and manage global, Apple's global COVID-19 response with diligence and thoughtfulness.
[00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:29.000]   Our first priority now and always the health and safety of our employees, supply chain partners, excuse me.
[00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:36.000]   Customers in the communities in which we operate our profound gratitude with those in the front lines of confronting this public health emergency.
[00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:43.000]   I think they took it seriously, although there is this line outside of China.
[00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:50.000]   Customer demand across our product and service categories have been strong to date and in line with our expectations.
[00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:56.000]   Apple is fundamentally strong and disruption, this disruption to our business is only temporary.
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:03.000]   I guess, you know, a year is temporary, but no one knew how long it was going to be.
[00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:11.000]   But also all companies that operate at this scale, whether they're in technology, whether they're in investments, whether they're in finance,
[00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:16.000]   they actually have full-time departments that do nothing but run disaster simulations.
[00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:17.000]   They got a plan.
[00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:18.000]   Yeah.
[00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:31.000]   I mean, they will, if you remember the episode from Parks and Recreation where the team gets an under lockdown because they're doing a simulation of what happens if the bubonic plague or whatever hits,
[00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:34.000]   and everyone has a role that they have to play, I'm saying that that's exactly what they do.
[00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:39.000]   It's like, what if there is like a limited nuclear war, then, and here's where it's happening.
[00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:40.000]   And here's where it's happening.
[00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.000]   And here's we're going to game this out as it was happening live today.
[00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:47.000]   Do you think Apple's that big at this point that that's the kind of operating at that global scale and planning?
[00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:58.000]   Maybe not quite that scale, but the other thing that they had, it sounds bad to say in working in their favor is that they've already gone through these problems with the bird flu in China a few years ago.
[00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:03.000]   They've also had the problem of dealing with wildfires in their own backyard.
[00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:11.000]   So they were very, very much prepared for what if there is a desire, we want to make sure that whenever there's a disaster of these two kinds that we've seen before,
[00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:13.000]   we know exactly what its response are going to be.
[00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:17.000]   I think they can't plan everything, but they can make sure that a lot of the companies,
[00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:29.000]   the big question that a lot of people were having back in March is like, "Gee, how come Microsoft and Facebook have millions of N95 masks to donate to relief workers?"
[00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:32.000]   It's like, "Well, because again, they needed them.
[00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:39.000]   They were buying them up when they were readily available a couple years ago because there were fires going on every single season because of global warming,
[00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:41.000]   and they need to pass them out to their employees."
[00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:52.000]   So that's the sort of stuff that they have to sort of think about when they have the coordinate hundreds of thousands of human beings all the way across the planet to have to be healthy and remain productive.
[00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:59.000]   By March 13th, Apple realized WWDC wasn't going to happen in June.
[00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:03.000]   They said it kicks off with an all online format.
[00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:11.000]   Which only they and Microsoft did because Google and Facebook canceled IO and F8.
[00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:21.000]   Again, when you look at how some of these other companies responded, you really have to be impressed by Apple's dogged determination to keep businesses usual.
[00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:25.000]   Google basically just threw up their hands and said, "Yeah, 2020."
[00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:27.000]   And disappeared.
[00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:28.000]   Yeah.
[00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:30.000]   And they're the biggest streaming company in the world.
[00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:31.000]   I know.
[00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:32.000]   Interesting.
[00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:40.000]   Meanwhile, Apple said, "But okay, but here's an opportunity you guys are going to be at home. So design a new chip for us, would you?"
[00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:45.000]   If you could take a chip fab home with you, everybody, you got seven, so we're going to have to share it.
[00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:46.000]   Well, they make a few.
[00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:51.000]   They had the chips, but the thing that was interesting is that they did not have the streaming.
[00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:55.000]   We all know from multiple sources what Apple's streaming situation has been in the past.
[00:16:55.000 --> 00:17:02.000]   And it's been, they've had incidents in the past too, and they developed a way to quote John Gruber to make an Apple TV show.
[00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:07.000]   Where almost every month there was a new episode, which was incredibly well shot and incredibly well delivered.
[00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:14.000]   And for WWDC, they also delivered all the sessions with all of the different engineers, with their little Chachkas on the desks.
[00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:15.000]   They did beautiful, too.
[00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:16.000]   Only imagine WebEx.
[00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:17.000]   Yeah.
[00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:20.000]   They must have been just impressive for Apple, which is not that company.
[00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:27.000]   So they had basically three months to put it together. And as soon as they said, we're going to be online, they must have started shooting.
[00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:38.000]   But they also knew something we didn't know at the time is how important this WWDC was going to be, because this was going to be the coming out party for the M1 for Apple Silicon.
[00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:39.000]   Yeah.
[00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:48.000]   We didn't know that at the time, but man, if you're talking to developers, you're going to have one shot and you better get, you better make it a good shot.
[00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:55.000]   And I think we were so blown away for the first time going down in the lab, seeing Johnny Saruji.
[00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:58.000]   I think that's where Johnny made his debut, right?
[00:17:58.000 --> 00:17:59.000]   Yeah.
[00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:07.000]   It was so impressive that actually, I think it won people over in a way that a live WWDC keynote would not have.
[00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:10.000]   Yeah, I agree.
[00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:11.000]   I think that this was--
[00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:13.000]   I had Kyan badging in with like a fish tank.
[00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:14.000]   Yeah.
[00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:15.000]   It was whimsical.
[00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:16.000]   Yeah.
[00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:17.000]   Andy?
[00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:18.000]   Yeah.
[00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:40.000]   I think that this might have demonstrated to a lot of these big companies how limiting, having a fully live focus, basically shutting down a good percentage of their campus and their staff for four whole days or three whole days, how limiting that could be when they could possibly created a much better experience for the developers and for the people who need this information by simply making sure that this--
[00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:59.000]   I'm going to actually just script this out and shoot this and edit this and drop them at the appropriate times that we don't actually need to have that energy of 3,000 people in a big hall cheering because someone's talking about how they're bravely going to continue to use the lightning cable on the iPhone.
[00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:04.000]   So I wonder if we're going to start to see this as-- it was a quaint thing we did.
[00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:16.000]   We're going to still do a couple of live events, but we don't really want to have to put up a party tent on our campus or off campus for three days a year, every single year, and host and make all those jackets and pins.
[00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:20.000]   Yeah, I mean, that's the problem as developers love the jackets and the pins.
[00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:22.000]   It really is to woo developers.
[00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:33.000]   But ultimately, if the informational quality, the presentation is that much better, which it was, all of us at the time even said, "Why don't you do this this way from now on? This is absolutely great."
[00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:35.000]   And here's the thing I do like.
[00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:42.000]   It's always been a very hard to get ticket and a limited number of developers can get there.
[00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:47.000]   So as much as they like the pins and the jackets, the fact that anybody could go to WWE.
[00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:48.000]   Oh, tell me.
[00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:49.000]   Yeah.
[00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:50.000]   You pay for it.
[00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:51.000]   They're free.
[00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:54.000]   Anybody could see WWDC this year.
[00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:55.000]   Very democratic.
[00:19:55.000 --> 00:20:02.000]   I think a big-- again, of all the companies, Apple probably didn't make the most profit out of it.
[00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:15.000]   They made the most profit out of 2020, but they certainly showed the most creativity, ingenuity, and drive in making this a positive year for the company.
[00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:17.000]   And they really deserve a pat on the back.
[00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:27.000]   I can't think of another company that took these lemons that 2020 handed us and made such a nice batch of lemonade.
[00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:37.000]   It was also in March that Apple released with Google news of an API that they would add to the iPhone.
[00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:42.000]   Google would add to all Android phones that would allow COVID-19 tracking.
[00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:44.000]   This was pretty controversial.
[00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:55.000]   It may still be controversial, although it is finding new life because first of all, a couple of months ago, it got turned on automatically.
[00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:57.000]   It was never turned on automatically.
[00:20:57.000 --> 00:20:58.000]   It was always opt in.
[00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:03.000]   But it got, without an app in California, for instance, we can use it just by saying, "Yeah, turn it on."
[00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:06.000]   I have yet to get a COVID-19 alert.
[00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:08.000]   So I don't know how useful it is.
[00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:23.000]   But you might have seen, I know, Andy, you were talking before the show that this county of Los Angeles has decided that they're going to use Apple and Apple's wallet to let vaccine recipients hold proof that they got the vaccine.
[00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:31.000]   And I think Apple has really found a good role in this without challenging privacy.
[00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:34.000]   People trust Apple a little bit more on this.
[00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:37.000]   And so I think this is really good.
[00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:49.000]   The COVID tracker they announced in March, and now this ability to have in your wallet the validation that you've been vaccinated is fantastic.
[00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:51.000]   Google will do it too, by the way.
[00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:52.000]   Yeah.
[00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:57.000]   I think that people, the uptake of this sort of technology is going to go up next year.
[00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:08.000]   If it turns out, if it means that I'm sorry, but we're not going to let you check into a hotel, at least you have proof of vaccination, we're not going to let you attend this live event unless you can present proof of vaccination.
[00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:15.000]   And obviously, the ability to just long press a switch on the side of your phone to bring up a wallet app and a QR code.
[00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:16.000]   That could be scanned.
[00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:23.000]   So you had the vaccination, you've been cleansed for the past three or four months, absolutely, by all means.
[00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:26.000]   And enjoy your fog head concert.
[00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:30.000]   If only.
[00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:34.000]   There weren't a whole lot of hardware releases in the first half of the year.
[00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:41.000]   There was the new iPad, MacBook Air that came out in March, which I bought, which I'm now.
[00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:43.000]   Sorry that I bought.
[00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:49.000]   No, I'm not, but at least is using it, but I keep saying to her, you wanted M1, trust me, you wanted M1.
[00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:59.000]   They updated the iPad Pro in March to include LIDAR on the back and support the Magic Keyboard, which is nice to give it the trackpad support by April.
[00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:01.000]   They had the iPhone SE.
[00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:02.000]   Oh, and the Magic Keyboard.
[00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:04.000]   We got, I think that was even bigger news than the iPad.
[00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:05.000]   Oh, yeah.
[00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:06.000]   Yeah.
[00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:08.000]   But did the Magic Keyboard come out this year?
[00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:14.000]   Yeah, it came out the same year as the new iPad and it was backwards compatible with the previous iPad Pro, which was interesting.
[00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:18.000]   And it would turn out to be forwards compatible with the new iPad Air.
[00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:20.000]   But we also got, we didn't get a presentation.
[00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:24.000]   There was no end of the iPhone SE, the new iPhone SE, but there was no event.
[00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:34.000]   The March event was widely expected to be a replay of 2016 when we got the first SE and the 9.7 inch iPad Pro, but they ended up doing two separate news announcements.
[00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:39.000]   And they didn't have the video stuff lined up yet. So we got like this quaint, Apple didn't even air it.
[00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:42.000]   They gave some of us in the media this video and then Jason Steloposted it.
[00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:48.000]   I posted it, Craig Federighi showing off how to use the cursor and a bunch of developers showing off their apps.
[00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:49.000]   Yeah.
[00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:53.000]   And it was just a really interesting wild sort of an introduction.
[00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:58.000]   Maybe that was, that was one where Apple didn't got caught with their pants down a little bit.
[00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:01.000]   Although the Craig Federighi video was quite impressive.
[00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:04.000]   And it made me think, wow, this might really work.
[00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:07.000]   Now in hindsight, here we are nine months later.
[00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:14.000]   Is the magic keyboard, is adding trackpad support and pointers support to the iPad?
[00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:16.000]   How big a deal is that, Renee?
[00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:19.000]   It's a hugely expensive game changer.
[00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:23.000]   If you can afford that $300 plus keyboard, it's the same price as a laptop.
[00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:27.000]   It's for me an amazing, yeah, it makes it an amazing.
[00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:32.000]   Well, some people have always wanted an iPad that was just worked more like a MacBook and this gives them that.
[00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:40.000]   And there is a huge segment of Apple's customer base that is just not price sensitive when it comes to these things because it's got a pro label on it.
[00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:44.000]   So that makes it quantifiably premium in some ways.
[00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:50.000]   And everyone I know who's got one and me myself just loves it because it's more of a dock.
[00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:52.000]   That's the thing is they didn't make a keyboard, they made a dock.
[00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:54.000]   So it doesn't pretend to be a laptop.
[00:24:54.000 --> 00:25:02.000]   So you take your iPad on it, you type away as if it was a MacBook and then you just get up, you pull your iPad off and you walk away and it's a full-on tablet again.
[00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:06.000]   And that little shift I think in focus made it really useful for a lot of people.
[00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:14.000]   It also though puts the iPad in direct competition with their MacBook Airs because you're talking the same price point.
[00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:20.000]   It's basically, do you want touch or not, right? Is that the choice?
[00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:25.000]   Actually I shouldn't say that because the operating systems are drastically different.
[00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:32.000]   One is a truck with amenities and one is a car that now has a little bit of a point about it.
[00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:41.000]   I'm a command line guy and so I can never really be fully comfortable with iOS because I always feel a little bit like my hands are tied behind my back.
[00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:51.000]   So for me, it's no competition but you're saying, do you young people like iOS? Is that what you're saying?
[00:25:51.000 --> 00:26:00.000]   My Linux nerd friend, like a Georgia's husband who is a network administrator, IT type Linux, everything, builds his own gaming VR PCs.
[00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:05.000]   He does not like the MacBook at all. He uses it on the Magic Keyboard all the time.
[00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:12.000]   I don't know what it is anymore. What do the kids do now? They don't tell them anymore. Do they really only VNC in or they terminal in or something?
[00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:16.000]   No one tells them that's anymore. It's a SH baby. SSH.
[00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:19.000]   That's it. Yeah. SSH in and do all that.
[00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:24.000]   Ah, yeah. I guess if you want a command line, you should get Linux and otherwise you should have an iPad.
[00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:29.000]   What do you think Andy? Did Apple create a competitor for itself at the same price point?
[00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:33.000]   Even very, very similar chips, just different operating systems.
[00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:44.000]   I don't think that they're cannibalizing each other. I think that they're increasing the value proposition of what is, let's face it, a really expensive computer.
[00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:50.000]   It's $1,000 for the larger iPad Pro. That's the commitment.
[00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:52.000]   Without the keyboard.
[00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:56.000]   And then at $350 plus $100 if you want the keyboard and the pencil.
[00:26:56.000 --> 00:27:12.000]   And that's it. But even if you've just spent $1,000 on an iPad Pro, in a world in which $1,000 will buy you a very, very good Windows 10 tablet that next year or the year after or the year after that will run some really good ARM based silicon, but not now.
[00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:23.000]   When you consider this is something that couldn't run actual real desktop software for that kind of a budget on another platform, I think that it makes it more competitive.
[00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:32.000]   Like Renee said, there are a lot of people who have the kind of money where it's not as though $350 doesn't matter, but it's not a really, really heavy choice.
[00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:45.000]   It's something where they've got the dough, they like the way it looks, they like the way that this thing performs from a productivity standpoint when you have an integrated keyboard and a trackpad and it's very, very smart sort of display and they'll go for it.
[00:27:45.000 --> 00:28:03.000]   But the other part of it is that this, it really does, it moves the needle a little bit on the Mac when you think of the iPad Pro, particularly the smaller one as not as a tablet, but as a Mac OS side card target, as I can walk anywhere inside.
[00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:25.000]   I can carry this little sleek Apple touchpad device with this nice little folding keyboard anywhere I go in the office building. And because I'm marrying the display from my Mac book Pro in my office to it, in a very, very real sense, it is the super, super thin and light touch screen based Mac that a lot of us have been begging for for a long, long time.
[00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:28.000]   So like I said, it comes down to value proposition.
[00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:39.000]   And preference, obviously. It's interesting too, because that old Phil Schiller doctrine was always, you know, they want to cannibalize themselves. They don't ever want to be in a situation where another company cannibalizes them.
[00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:45.000]   And there if the Mac takes sales from the iPad, the iPad has to fight back. And if the iPad takes sales from the Mac, the Mac has to fight back.
[00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:54.000]   And this was a huge year for this because the magic keyboard really put pressure on the Mac. Like people were like, I'm using an iPad from now on.
[00:28:54.000 --> 00:29:07.000]   And then the M1 Max came out and they're like, look at this battery life and you can run Final Cut Pro and you can run X code on it. And boy did those max push back on the iPad Pro. And I saw people switching back and forth, you know, both times this year.
[00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:19.000]   To be fair, though, just to say quickly that if you are used, if you what you need as a laptop and you're trying to use an iPad instead, there's going to be some pain that is inevitable.
[00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:29.000]   You are this is like, as this Werner Herzog's view of the universe that the universe will be indifferent to your suffering and there will be suffering and you can get you can get around it.
[00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:42.000]   And it's certainly very, very useful, but there will be that time where, oh, that's great. No, I can definitely join your live stream. Oh, that's right. You're using a piece of software that kind of works on iOS, but doesn't do the things I needed to do on Mac.
[00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:45.000]   Okay. Yeah, I guess I'll bring my laptop.
[00:29:45.000 --> 00:30:02.000]   I also have to say, well, seeing this is funny because I wanted to say, well, then the M one just makes me want to use the Mac, but it is really essentially the iPad chip. So I don't know what that means.
[00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:11.000]   I think it's the other way around. I think Apple always built a Mac. Like, I think you're right. Not to be facetious, but I think Apple is a good way to put a top chips and they put them into these mobile devices.
[00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:22.000]   So even last year, even when this iPad Pro came out in March, I remember thinking, this is why is it so overpowered? This is so much more than you need in this device.
[00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:31.000]   And I think I said it. I think if you look back, you could find me saying that. And my presumption was, well, we're going to see a lot more from the iPad at some point, or iOS at some point.
[00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:44.000]   That's going to need this horsepower. But I think you're right, Renee, that was the wrong take on it. The right take was exactly what you said. They had built a desk job chip. And since they had it lying around, they put it in the iPad. But they knew where they were going.
[00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:54.000]   Because they were used to these tiny, tiny thermal envelopes. Wow. Was it efficient? And it turned out when you put it back into an actual desktop machine, it was, you know, with a big battery. It just flew.
[00:30:54.000 --> 00:31:09.000]   The honeymoon has not ended for the M1 for me. Every day I use it. Every day I forget to plug it in and it doesn't matter. I just think this is a sea change in desktop computing. It really is.
[00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:20.000]   So those were some new products, the SE. There was also, they started making custom face shields, which was a nice thing to do. We never heard much more about that.
[00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:33.000]   They killed the butterfly keyboard. Yes. In May of 2020, finally acknowledging that when they launched the 13 inch MacBook Pro, that perhaps not everybody liked the butterflies.
[00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:36.000]   Will that ever come back? Is that gone for good?
[00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:44.000]   Evil cannot be destroyed. I was fearful that we would get a 12 inch MacBook with that keyboard.
[00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:55.000]   Apple never said that it was dead. They just said that, you know, we're still looking at it for other applications. And I was just the first one's going to be a 12 inch M1 and the world's going to break in half again.
[00:31:55.000 --> 00:32:03.000]   And I just can't take it in 2020 anymore. Please. The keyboard on the new 13 inch MacBook Pro with M1 is very nice. Very usable. Yeah.
[00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:14.000]   Very good. Yep. A point. I'm really surprised. It's as good. I think as it's not it's not my favorite mobile keyboard by any stretch, but it's a very, very good keyboard.
[00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:20.000]   It's as good probably as the 2015 MacBook Pro keyboard that it replaced. And that's kind of all I want.
[00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:23.000]   That's saying a lot. That was a that was the best, the last good Mac.
[00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:29.000]   I can use it. There's a key. There's there's actually more than half of a millimeter of key travel to it. Yeah. Yeah. It's amazing.
[00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:33.000]   Who knew that? Who knew that that was a key to comfort as the chat room says the butter has fly.
[00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:53.000]   Let's see. Oh, and this was the year of sad to say that Tim Cook along with Mark Zuckerberg and Jeff Bezos and all the tech execs were hauled to DC in July to testify.
[00:32:53.000 --> 00:33:04.000]   Although some of what the Senate hearing was for Tim Cook was it as as the Atlantic put it a genius bar visit.
[00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:10.000]   Questions like, why the hell do I have to keep updating my apps on my iPhone all the time? And why don't you fix that?
[00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:16.000]   I'm sorry. I was like Amy from Brooklyn nine nine completely faded into his background. There was no contrast. Very smart.
[00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:25.000]   It was because like Mark was all up in their face and Jeff kept saying you couldn't use the mute button and didn't know how Amazon worked and that enraged them.
[00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:33.000]   And Tim just sat there, blended into the wall and they forgot he was there for 45 minutes. Yes. That was from the late John McCain.
[00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:39.000]   Carl Levin of Michigan said, I have an iPhone in my pocket.
[00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:47.000]   And I have an iPad right here. My granddaughter even knows how to use it. All of it.
[00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:53.000]   Okay. Let me tell you about my grandchild. Oh, it's a responsible running government. It's a world.
[00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:58.000]   It is our governor on my phone. I don't know what it's like in your neck of the woods.
[00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:07.000]   Well, I think you have a fairly young prime minister. Everybody. Everybody in DC is now well over 70.
[00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:13.000]   Some of them into their 80s and beyond. We're going to start having to have a Senate nap time.
[00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:22.000]   Anyway, you hear people say like the crackpot senator from blah, blah who can't turn on his iPhone, but they vote for him every year or whatever it is.
[00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:31.000]   Well, he brings home the bacon. You can run the government. He brings home the bacon. Senator Kelly. I out Republican of New Hampshire said to Tim Apple.
[00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:41.000]   So nice to meet you. I have an iPad. I guess Tim probably hears that all the time. Oh, Tim Cook from Apple, right? I have an iPhone.
[00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:49.000]   Like Tim doesn't think. Yes. So does everybody. It leaves complain about autocorrect. Use your power for good.
[00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:58.000]   Yeah. If they were if they were like a like a console like Xbox game for like Senate hearings, you can put together like fantasy match ups.
[00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:07.000]   Just like I say, what if Larry Bird played on a team with check like I would love to play out this the same game only. Yeah, it's not Tim Cook. It's Steve Jobs.
[00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:17.000]   That's that's the person you're you're saying, Hey, well, my granddaughter uses it. This is an iPad for this. And he's and to have Steve reply with.
[00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:25.000]   I wish we could elevate the conversation a little bit. Yeah. Yeah. I have to apologize. I was reading article from 2013. Although it wasn't that much.
[00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:36.000]   Yeah, that wasn't that much different. That was the one where like Senator asked a big problem about something that going on with the iPhone.
[00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:43.000]   Then didn't realize that it was Sundar Pichai on the stand. Yeah. So we don't make the iPhone. Yeah, no. Yes.
[00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:50.000]   That's the thing. It hasn't in seven years. It didn't get any better. I should the giveaway was when when John McCain asked a question.
[00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:54.000]   I should have I should have recognized the improbability of that.
[00:35:54.000 --> 00:36:09.000]   The presence still felt in the Senate to this very still felt you never you never forget the greats. Phil Schiller became an Apple fellow stepping down from his role day to day role as a director of marketing and Apple that was in August.
[00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:25.000]   Yeah. And actually a good replacement. Jaws. Greg Jawswiak filling in and really having an engineer in that role to me anyway as a technology geek and as an enthusiast.
[00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:36.000]   I always want to see the I don't like marketers because they say mealy mouth things and engineers tend to speak the truth. So I always like seeing engineers if you can in those roles.
[00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:39.000]   I'm sure they make terrible marketers though.
[00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:46.000]   This whole team is amazing. Like his whole team like you talk to them and they can because like a lot of companies will talk to their marketing people and they're like use car salesman.
[00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:54.000]   They'll tell you whatever you want to do. They can do anything. They just said they're basically sales people. His team will dive deep into the entire camera system.
[00:36:54.000 --> 00:37:04.000]   The entire silicon stack the radio stack and they know all of it cold because at Apple the marketing job isn't just selling the device. It's building the device you want to sell. They have to do both both halves of that.
[00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:10.000]   It's a very it's a very interesting work marketing organization but I think it makes them so much more effective and informed that.
[00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:16.000]   Yeah actually because you get those regular briefings from Apple you probably saw or see the difference there.
[00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:28.000]   Yeah well also that historically Phil Schiller wasn't just wasn't just the marketing guy who was once every week gets a PowerPoint presentation to show here is what we're thinking about building over the next.
[00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:40.000]   He was a leadership team of course. Exactly. That position is someone who is in the room where it happens and has a voice and no I don't think that's a good idea or I don't think that's going to be relevant in the next two or three years.
[00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:49.000]   So it's much more it's much more than putting on a good suit and going on Good Morning America to show somebody how wonderful this new battery is.
[00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:55.000]   But you as one of the people told Steve know we're making a small tablet Steve we don't care what you say.
[00:37:55.000 --> 00:38:09.000]   And that's an interesting position to be. No kidding. The Apple versus epic epic battle began in August. It will not end. In fact there was a new shot across the bow from epic games which got people in the room.
[00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:18.000]   They're not going to be able to get a shot at the game. It's a little bit of a little bit of a shot at the game which got people a little hot out of the collar.
[00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:34.000]   Cara Swisher was a little salty over receiving. Did you get your free Fortnite campaign box? Probably not. I don't think I'm on there. I don't think I'm on there. I don't think I'm on there. Christmas. Because that they know that my honor is my integrity is such.
[00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:46.000]   I'll take half in cash though. So yeah you get a satin jacket that says free Fortnite with an apple apple colored logo but it's actually a goat.
[00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:52.000]   You know it's a Fortnite goat you also get a and that was that's not so bad although not great because those are expensive.
[00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:58.000]   But you also got a galaxy tab S7 running Fortnite.
[00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:07.000]   So can we have a little conversation with Samsung marketing? I mean like it's okay when you make fun of apple for getting rid of the power plug and then get rid of it yourself the next month.
[00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:14.000]   I mean Xiaomi does that too. That's fine. But could you at least have a little bit of brand integrity? Like you don't have to hit yourself to Fortnite. You're Samsung.
[00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:18.000]   You're one of the biggest companies in the world. Please act like it.
[00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:39.000]   Kara Swisher treated read the room epic games in Samsung sending a pricey logo winter jacket and expensive tablets and mimicking Apple style to make a free Fortnite PR point about being an underdog feels yuck in the midst of widespread economic suffering sending it back obviously but not classy.
[00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:46.000]   There are plenty of influencers however who will be wearing that all over their place.
[00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:54.000]   They did this whole new normal marketing thing too that I thought was really distasteful. You don't get to define the new normal and tell me that I'm living in 2020 from now on.
[00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:58.000]   You get to be as empathetic and kind as possible this year.
[00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:19.000]   Please. Yeah. And this is the exactly sort of thing that really really seriously bums me out about the level of discourse and amongst commentators that it's that there are so many YouTube channels that if they do any really good commentary and any good content what's in addition to this other stuff.
[00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:25.000]   The fact that they also hey I just got this box from Fortnite let's let's do it on.
[00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:40.000]   And that's and that's exactly what these boxes are designed to do that hey we'll do we'll do if you got like a people who will you got a million viewers per per video they need content they also need exclusivity and they know that doesn't matter what the content is.
[00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:58.000]   And with the with the with the sub caption don't I feel special they sent me this $180.88 jacket plus this tablet and maybe buried deep down a couple weeks later they will mention that oh well we actually played it on the on the Galaxy tab and it kind of stinks.
[00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:14.000]   It's it's I mean again I will this is why that that line from Steve Jobs has came so readily that there are times right just want to be silent for 10 seconds and then quietly say what do you say we elevate the conversation somewhat.
[00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:22.000]   Well I also heard Andy but there was this whole go ahead this whole thing this like over the last two years to where like we're used to getting review product the product arrives.
[00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:33.000]   We get we know how long we get to keep it for we have to send it back but then this year there's increasingly hashtag gift from where a bunch of people who would ostensibly be reviewers are just getting given things.
[00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:41.000]   And I don't understand the relationship anymore as to what that is or what that means it's it's a very it's very confusing.
[00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:48.000]   I just mean but I don't really understand the point of giving her an Xbox Xbox refrigerator.
[00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:55.000]   Yeah that's her and I respect her for her.
[00:41:55.000 --> 00:42:10.000]   That's one of that's one of the exceptions where I wish that as soon as you get that phone call from PR saying hey we'd love to send you something but we're going to have to freight it over and that's okay stop tell me exactly what it is and if it is not directly relevant to my area of
[00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:12.000]   which again thank you.
[00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:24.000]   But you know she's not going to do that because there is such a battle for views that she can't I mean that's her business is getting views on YouTube and how many views does that generate for you millions.
[00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:39.000]   Well I think it's also deeper than that this year because there was an absolute dearth of sponsorships and advertising and everything especially in the beginning of the year where nobody knew what was going to happen in 2020 and I think everybody inked whatever brand deals they could as fast as possible
[00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:45.000]   you could sign best buy or Xbox or Google or whomever to sort of keep you afloat for 2020.
[00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:58.000]   I think that's why we saw so many videos from people we never saw them before that were completely sponsored videos or completely sponsored articles or like we see some major major tech publications with sponsored tweets to sponsored articles this year.
[00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:01.000]   I think it was just like a huge floatation device.
[00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:16.000]   Yeah I just wish that there was more of a part I have to acknowledge that I'm from a previous generation that's right which doesn't mean that I have more integrity it means that when I grew up before I was writing about such stuff.
[00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:35.000]   There was such an iron firewall between any sort of marketing content that it was just it was like being in the 1900s and considering like being seen on the arm of being a woman being seen on the arm of someone who was not your father or your brother or your husband like we would never do that
[00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:50.000]   Oh my god we wouldn't have because there was there was definitely a connotation to oh so they decided to give you out of the blue a brand new Jaguar with like the Microsoft logo on the side of it and you've been driving it for the past year.
[00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:53.000]   And that's not supposed to make me think that you're in the pocket of Microsoft.
[00:43:53.000 --> 00:44:04.000]   Whereas today people who grew up with a different environment can understand that no they're they they were just doing it. They're doing this one video as a joke.
[00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:09.000]   It's a fun piece of content they can have a lot of fun with it they can do something that will amuse themselves and their audience.
[00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:19.000]   But the thing is if they're if the Xbox shoots purple flames as soon as you plug it in they will report that gosh this thing is shooting purple flames and I lost my eyebrows and I recommend you don't buy it.
[00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:29.000]   It's it's it's it's harder for people of my generation to keep as those saying my go T and no T in your hands at the same time and not have your mind blown by it.
[00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:39.000]   Well that's their individual people. Yeah and that's that's the good news but I have to also say that I don't think this helps epic because it just makes them look a little scummy.
[00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:59.000]   And this is this is so tone deaf. You know what helped solve the problem more than the epics and this battle is going to go on in court forever is Microsoft's ex cloud just saying okay fine we'll put it on Safari on iOS.
[00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:14.000]   Stadia Safari on iOS. Oh all better. You know if the good news is an Apple's not going to close this loophole because this is keeping them out of the monopoly courts.
[00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:19.000]   And I don't mean the one with the guy with the monocle and the big mustache.
[00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:28.000]   I'm sorry. It's such a weird thing Leo like when Epic first did this I thought they were geniuses because like yes they went through it they did basically a Trojan horse.
[00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:38.000]   They went right after Apple and Google and I thought this is great like you're you're hitting them where they're weak and then they sued Apple and Google and like but why Google does sideloading.
[00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:44.000]   They're like yeah but it's not good enough and like hold on a minute and then they go to court and the judge just annihilates them.
[00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:51.000]   She gets the guy going please don't make us talk again and then she says we'll just hold the money and escrow everyone can play the games everyone will be happy.
[00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:58.000]   We'll figure this all out and you'll get your money and they still said no and I go okay well then you're this is not good faith like no you don't have the best interest of your players.
[00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:01.000]   They tip their hand right I was on your side I quickly change.
[00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:06.000]   Yes they they showed it was Tim Sweeney and those as they showed.
[00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:09.000]   You know lack of faith from the very beginning so fine.
[00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:16.000]   And I'm still on Microsoft side with X cloud like this is not like an Apple thing I was on Microsoft side and Epic side I am now on Microsoft side and not.
[00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:25.000]   I guess the only thing in Sweeney could come forward say okay fine but I got to point out that that Safari hack does not give you the same results.
[00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:33.000]   I mean that would be the only thing but I have to say he has the escrow thing like he could just they could literally just put the game back on and they'll get all the money if they went in court.
[00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:42.000]   Well he should have done that but but he might say you know there is a loophole Microsoft and Google have opted for but we don't feel that's a good experience for our users.
[00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:56.000]   I have to say in fact it turned out the only way you could play Cyberpunk 2077 was playing it because it worked if it crashed on Xbox One and it crashed on PlayStation 4.
[00:46:56.000 --> 00:47:03.000]   If you didn't have a state of the art set next generation console and so few people do that was a good way to do it.
[00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:08.000]   I played it on Stadia and it was fine and yeah was even the PC version streamed right.
[00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:20.000]   Yeah well it looked and it looked good on my M1 Mac laptop and if you could say well Macs are not for gaming except whoa wait a minute thanks to X cloud and Stadia.
[00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:29.000]   What are you playing? Yeah they're good terminals. They're the VT 100 of the old dare I say the VT 102 of the 21st century.
[00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:34.000]   Maybe you guys. Go ahead Rene.
[00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:41.000]   I think this is still like remarkably myopic on Apple's point and just shows that they're not looking at the app store as something that has evolved over 10 years.
[00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:42.000]   Well they're going to have to.
[00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:47.000]   Yeah this is like Netflix it's like saying we don't want Netflix because they're not putting all the Netflix titles and iTunes.
[00:47:47.000 --> 00:48:00.000]   Right that is one thing though that Apple did this year that was an acknowledgement that we have to change which was they cut the commission for companies making less than a million dollars in the app store down to 15% they cut it in half.
[00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:05.000]   And that was I think I think that was a very good move they should be patted on the back.
[00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:10.000]   That's that goes a long way towards solving the monopoly issues. Do you agree Rene?
[00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:17.000]   It has a couple problems that they need to solve one is how it like how you get it versus how you lose it like just based on the calendar.
[00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:28.000]   And they they enacted some policies to prevent people from selling off apps to have like four apps under the million dollar thing instead of you know what like a company with over four like four million because they have four apps.
[00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:38.000]   So there's there's a few rough spots but I saw a lot of developers friends of ours get their their application approvals and they were ecstatic like I can hire an extra person.
[00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:42.000]   Double upgrade this. Yeah. Yeah. No, that's huge.
[00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:46.000]   And I think that that certainly makes developers feel a little better.
[00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:50.000]   It shows that Apple is at least paying attention that they're not completely.
[00:48:50.000 --> 00:48:56.000]   No talk to the hand. And yes, it was I think maybe even rushed out in response to all this.
[00:48:56.000 --> 00:49:00.000]   But at least it was something and it's a first step not a last step.
[00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:01.000]   Andy.
[00:49:01.000 --> 00:49:15.000]   That's that's that's a good point. And that's that's exactly why even though I don't think that I don't think that Fortnite is was the was a a biblical issue that needed to be discussed.
[00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:25.000]   However, the larger issue of is Apple running the app store in a way that is fair to that is optimal for all parties in the 21st century.
[00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:33.000]   I'm sorry. I was not twenty four century. They started it in the 21st century. I'm thinking of 2020, but it's now 2020.
[00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:44.000]   The app store was started over a decade ago if we can believe that now, but there are their policies that were from a decade ago that are still important and still relevant today.
[00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:51.000]   Or do we should we sort of insist that Apple start to revisit some of those and make new decisions.
[00:49:51.000 --> 00:50:01.000]   They certainly we didn't catch them. So, oh, gosh, well, we were we were going to be announcing these changes in September. Anyway, I guess we're going to have to move those up like about a month, month and a half.
[00:50:01.000 --> 00:50:07.000]   We may as well will just change some of the dates and the press releases. No, they probably weren't even they probably done the math on that at some point.
[00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:17.000]   Just as a way of knowledge, but they would not have done that if their feet had not been held to the fire by new lawsuits saying, well, guess what? This this is a vulnerability.
[00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:29.000]   This is something that you should at least come up with a really good explanation of why you why you think that 30% take for all comers, not just not just the the big earners, even the small people.
[00:50:29.000 --> 00:50:43.000]   Why that is still relevant? Why that is still a good number? Or is it time to start making it easier for small developers who are not doing like trying not trying to steal millions of dollars from kids parents with an app purchases.
[00:50:43.000 --> 00:50:50.000]   They're just trying to get people to pay two ninety nine for really nice little text editor. Is it time to revisit all of that? And that's what happened as a result of that.
[00:50:50.000 --> 00:51:05.000]   So that's why you might not necessarily think that when someone brings a case like this that they have a really great case, but that doesn't mean that apple or another company like that or a plaintiff like that defendant like that shouldn't be prepared to make their argument.
[00:51:05.000 --> 00:51:16.000]   Go in front of a judge and say here is we're going to explain ourselves and we're not explaining ourselves through PR and marketing at this point. We are doing it through lawyers because we know that their repercussions this time.
[00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:26.000]   Well, it also doesn't hurt the Washington DC was taken a little evil. I look at all this also plus and the EU. And I have to say there are a lot of people say, oh, the government shouldn't get involved.
[00:51:26.000 --> 00:51:37.000]   But at the very least, the threat of governmental interference and action is enough in many cases for these companies to go, okay, okay, well, wait a minute, hold on, hold on, we'll figure this out.
[00:51:37.000 --> 00:51:45.000]   So that's a good thing. And you know what, the threat has to be backed up by a potential for action. Certainly in the EU, there are huge fines.
[00:51:45.000 --> 00:51:54.000]   So I think this is a good thing. I think the companies aren't going to automatically do something that's not maybe in their best financial interest.
[00:51:54.000 --> 00:52:03.000]   But with a little bit of, you know, coercing, cajoling and cracking of the whip, maybe they'll do the right thing ultimately.
[00:52:03.000 --> 00:52:16.000]   It's almost like having a balance is a good thing, like having a balance of regulation and reinter, like any one of those is too much in excess things breakdown, but we should strive for more balance in our culture, not so much, you know, a one way or the other.
[00:52:16.000 --> 00:52:38.000]   I agree. Binary. So that takes us to September. Remember September. Apple Watch and iPad. Apple Watch, Apple Watch SE and then iPad Air plus they announced the Apple One subscription service.
[00:52:38.000 --> 00:52:54.000]   They did it at the time, announced an Apple appeals process for the app store, which was good. I know they're important thing. Yeah. So September 1st, 1st of what turned out, we didn't know at the time was going to be three, count them three trilogy of product reveals.
[00:52:54.000 --> 00:53:02.000]   It's like the Hobbit. You could have done it in one. But okay. People were so angry because they were sure there's no way Apple's not going to announce an iPhone in September. There is no way.
[00:53:02.000 --> 00:53:08.000]   And then Tim click right at the beginning goes, Apple Watch and iPad and you just heard the.
[00:53:08.000 --> 00:53:20.000]   But again, going back to March and April, and everybody said, look, supply chains disrupted. This is going to happen. There's going to be a few weeks to lay. And that's exactly what happened.
[00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:29.000]   It was one month later in October. They announced the iPhone 12 mini, the iPhone 12, the iPhone 12 Pro, the iPhone 12 Pro Max.
[00:53:29.000 --> 00:53:34.000]   Is that the most iPhones they've ever announced in one fell swoop?
[00:53:34.000 --> 00:53:40.000]   When you count the SE, it's by four is the most they've ever announced at once. They've announced three at a time before the last two years.
[00:53:40.000 --> 00:53:45.000]   So they announced for this time, plus the SE earlier in the year. Five five five five and add of iPhones.
[00:53:45.000 --> 00:53:53.000]   And then Ted. But this is what they did. I remember when the iPod was at the peak of its success.
[00:53:53.000 --> 00:53:59.000]   The way they found growth was by slicing it up into different categories and prices and sizes.
[00:53:59.000 --> 00:54:07.000]   Every industry that's mature, you start to segment segment it. And of course, as Steve Jobs pointed out, when he came back to Apple in the 90s, this is risky.
[00:54:07.000 --> 00:54:16.000]   You don't want your product line to become too crazy and diverse. But this is what this is kind of there's a it's balance again, Renee. It's balance.
[00:54:16.000 --> 00:54:20.000]   This is what you need to do. They also have a go ahead.
[00:54:20.000 --> 00:54:31.000]   I'm sorry. It's also the effects of being in a really, really competitive new market where when the for most of the iPhones life, you really could get away with having just one $800 model.
[00:54:31.000 --> 00:54:37.000]   But at this point, you need to have the luxury model. You need to have the baseline model and God help us all.
[00:54:37.000 --> 00:54:45.000]   If you work for Apple, you have to figure out a way to make a budget oriented phone so that people who don't necessarily have $1,000 to spend on a phone.
[00:54:45.000 --> 00:54:55.000]   So people who are in the phone store at Verizon and AT&T who are seeing, wow, this phone, this phone that costs $300 that runs. I don't know what it is. I don't need to know what it is.
[00:54:55.000 --> 00:55:01.000]   Look, it has a bigger screen than this iPhone that I was going to be buying. It has more games on it than this other thing.
[00:55:01.000 --> 00:55:08.000]   Also, I like the fact that they've got a banana case for it. I want the banana case for the phone and they walk out with a $350 phone instead of the $800 phone.
[00:55:08.000 --> 00:55:12.000]   So this is this is market pressure at it's best.
[00:55:12.000 --> 00:55:21.000]   And the interesting thing though is they didn't, back in 2016, they made an iPhone SE that was smaller and less expensive and it combined those two markets.
[00:55:21.000 --> 00:55:29.000]   And it did pretty well, not explosively, but it did pretty well. This year they had an iPhone SE which was less expensive and an iPhone 12 Mini which was smaller.
[00:55:29.000 --> 00:55:35.000]   They split those two things apart and I'm not, I'm sure they want to test everything at this point and they're big enough to test everything.
[00:55:35.000 --> 00:55:42.000]   But I'm not sure either of those markets by itself is going to end up being as big even as a sort of middling market that the original SE was for them.
[00:55:42.000 --> 00:55:51.000]   Is the 12 nothing the best seller of the bunch? That's the one I see advertised a lot. I think the phone stores in the US.
[00:55:51.000 --> 00:55:58.000]   It's hard to tell because the pros sell early. The pros have spike and then the regular ones sell consistently throughout the year because nerds got to have their phones first.
[00:55:58.000 --> 00:56:17.000]   Yeah, we all got iPhone 12 pros of course. But I think that at least in the US, and I don't know how it is in the rest of the world, but in the US, most phone sales are driven from phone stores, company phone stores, and almost all the ads I see are for the 12, 12, 12.
[00:56:17.000 --> 00:56:19.000]   Because that's where they get, that's the best price point.
[00:56:19.000 --> 00:56:21.000]   The Mini is apparently doing the worst.
[00:56:21.000 --> 00:56:22.000]   Is it released?
[00:56:22.000 --> 00:56:27.000]   You think it's battery life or I don't think necessarily it's size. You think it's battery life?
[00:56:27.000 --> 00:56:32.000]   I think people on Twitter assume that they're the majority of the market when almost all the time we are a very small niche.
[00:56:32.000 --> 00:56:37.000]   And if you talk to like every designer, I know about it and loves it and a bunch of tech Twitter bought it and love it.
[00:56:37.000 --> 00:56:44.000]   But that's really not a mass market. They're always like, oh, I really want it. And I know everybody would buy it because I think I'm going to buy it.
[00:56:44.000 --> 00:56:46.000]   That's not how that works.
[00:56:46.000 --> 00:56:54.000]   How big does a screen have to be to contain one social media post with media without having to scroll and that's your answer?
[00:56:54.000 --> 00:57:08.000]   Well, I did again, despite COVID-19 and what could have been a, you know, a pixel five year, Apple showed some really nice new hardware.
[00:57:08.000 --> 00:57:17.000]   And they also solved at least to some degree a problem that the iPhone is going to face from now on and has faced for years, which is it's hard to come up with something new.
[00:57:17.000 --> 00:57:25.000]   LiDAR was impressive. The photography was impressive. Dolby Vision HDR was impressive.
[00:57:25.000 --> 00:57:30.000]   They were able to put it's enough new features. I think pro raw amazing.
[00:57:30.000 --> 00:57:35.000]   So photographers are happy. I think the new chip is incredibly fast.
[00:57:35.000 --> 00:57:46.000]   Apple's really going to see the benefit in both directions from its silicon development at this point where they also shift spatial audio for the AirPods Pro and then brought it to the end.
[00:57:46.000 --> 00:57:54.000]   Like it's just I don't think I'm used to my headphones getting that sort of feature improvement, like year over year.
[00:57:54.000 --> 00:58:00.000]   You know, with regards to what you think about it, we just didn't normally get new features for our headphones.
[00:58:00.000 --> 00:58:10.000]   Yeah, they were just their headphones. They got like a firmware update every once in a while to fix a problem, but that's like a major headline feature that they just added to it at WWDC.
[00:58:10.000 --> 00:58:21.000]   You're listening to our end of the year edition of Mac break weekly Renee Richie, Andy and not come so glad you guys could be here.
[00:58:21.000 --> 00:58:28.000]   It's kind of a little bittersweet that Laurie can't to sum up the year she was here right to the bitter end.
[00:58:28.000 --> 00:58:34.000]   I'm sure she's watching. We love you. We miss you, Laurie, but I'm glad that I've got you guys sitting around the fire.
[00:58:34.000 --> 00:58:39.000]   The spaceship came a take her away as they've taken away as it's taken away so many of my friends and journals.
[00:58:39.000 --> 00:58:46.000]   If they could just take a couple of pounds of flesh of mine with them, I'd be very, very happy.
[00:58:46.000 --> 00:58:53.000]   All right, let's move on. We've done now the first two product announcements.
[00:58:53.000 --> 00:58:58.000]   Oh, I left out the HomePod Mini. I was going to talk about that too.
[00:58:58.000 --> 00:58:59.000]   Yeah.
[00:58:59.000 --> 00:59:05.000]   Before we move on to product announcement number three, that was a big one, I think, the mini people that's.
[00:59:05.000 --> 00:59:11.000]   I suspect that's a small one, a small one. It was pretty clear that the HomePod.
[00:59:11.000 --> 00:59:16.000]   Oh, look at him in his Senate candle. It's like a little softball.
[00:59:16.000 --> 00:59:21.000]   Oh, so cute. It's like it's like your vacationing. You're on a cruise ship and this.
[00:59:21.000 --> 00:59:24.000]   That's like the plastic coconut that you got to keep after you had your mites.
[00:59:24.000 --> 00:59:27.000]   I think it's interesting. Not as tasty, but true.
[00:59:27.000 --> 00:59:34.000]   Google did the same thing where they had a very high end, three or four hundred dollar Google Home Max,
[00:59:34.000 --> 00:59:40.000]   which had very good sound, I think competed well with the HomePod's sound.
[00:59:40.000 --> 00:59:43.000]   But they discontinued that this year.
[00:59:43.000 --> 00:59:50.000]   All three companies, Amazon, Google and Apple, came out with one hundred dollar kind of softball-sized speakers.
[00:59:50.000 --> 00:59:55.000]   They seem to converge on the market. Is that because they're looking at each other and saying,
[00:59:55.000 --> 00:59:58.000]   "What are you going to do? What are you going to do?" Or is the market really saying,
[00:59:58.000 --> 01:00:02.000]   "No, we don't want to spend more than a hundred dollars."
[01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:04.000]   You have a Renee. Is it adequate?
[01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:12.000]   It's a mix of two things. Apple really did go into the HomePod without any idea of what Amazon was going to do.
[01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:16.000]   It didn't exist. It was a five-year-long project.
[01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:21.000]   They were trying to do computational audio. They were trying to do for speakers what they did for the iPhone camera,
[01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:26.000]   except instead of portrait mode and the other depth effects,
[01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:31.000]   they were going to do computational audio and spatial audio and adaptive EQ.
[01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:37.000]   I think Google and Apple both realized that putting that many speakers and microphones and all the other sensors in there was expensive.
[01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:40.000]   Google sort of hedged with both products early on and Apple's like,
[01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:45.000]   "We're going to pay down this technology now and make a three hundred dollar speaker."
[01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:48.000]   Because that's often how Apple does things.
[01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:53.000]   I think Amazon never had any interest in speaker quality. They were just getting elected into as many rooms as possible.
[01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:59.000]   They've driven the pride thing you can get them basically for free if you're willing to make it look like a tiger and put it in your kids' room for them.
[01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:06.000]   It's a vastly different strategy. Apple is still going for a speaker and they're leveraging the technology now in the AirPods too.
[01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:10.000]   It's the same stuff just stuck in your ears or stuck over your ears.
[01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:17.000]   It's early days. It's really impressive what they can do with really bad MP3 files and streaming video.
[01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:20.000]   What sound they can pull out of it.
[01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:23.000]   But I think it's a vastly different market than what Amazon has.
[01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:32.000]   It's not a commodity market at all for Apple. I just don't know if enough people are willing to pay what it costs for all that technology to get what's still limited sound quality.
[01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:39.000]   See, that's the difficulty. If there's a consistent problem that Apple has or a weakness that Apple has,
[01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:43.000]   it's that they don't understand the economics of good enough.
[01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:54.000]   There's a lot of products that on a speaker like that, they misjudge the idea of how good a speaker of that design has to be.
[01:01:54.000 --> 01:02:07.000]   Yes, you're winning certain contests, but their contests where the referees are people who are looking at spectograms and giving you charts and graphs as opposed to people who just plop this thing in their living room or in their bedroom.
[01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:12.000]   And then say, does that sound as good as anything I've ever heard? Yes. Okay. That's good enough.
[01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:18.000]   So why am I spending $400 for this instead of $150 for even a Bluetooth speaker?
[01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:30.000]   And then you add that's just speaker compared to speaker. When you also get into personal assistant, both Google and Amazon early on realized that the speaker was kind of incidental to the voice assistant feature.
[01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:38.000]   That's the magic, the ability to even just something as simple as an egg timer, even before things got really, really sophisticated.
[01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:43.000]   That's kind of that's kind of magical. That's why people are buying this device.
[01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:57.000]   That's why people are buying the world's largest store in the world's largest advertising company paying them to put a high quality omnigen art directional speaker inside their house because that's a really, really great feature and a really, really impressive application of technology.
[01:02:57.000 --> 01:03:07.000]   Meanwhile, Apple is trying to, Schlomo gets way, way too much, way, way too much stick from way, way too many people.
[01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:23.000]   The fact that it's not as good to me as the others doesn't mean that it's bad, but nonetheless, when it can't do the sort of magical, when it was late to the game of doing continual conversation, when the voice model was about eight, it felt like eight years
[01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:32.000]   behind the voice models that Google was using, when they're not making the integration with home automation worked quite so well.
[01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:43.000]   That's what lost in the game. Meanwhile, they'll put all those big sound demos, those big listening studios to say, "Oh, look how wonderful this sound is on our $400 speaker."
[01:03:43.000 --> 01:04:02.000]   When in reality, most people are saying, "Well, for your $400 speaker, I could buy two really nice smart speakers from Google plus three or four of their tiny $30 little smart speakers to put here and there so that I can still get alerts and still listen to music while I'm shaving and stuff like that."
[01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:19.000]   They really miss the idea of, "Here's what people are willing to pay and why they're willing to pay that money for smart speakers." They're turning around. I'm glad that they realize that perhaps a tangerine that costs $100 is much, much better than a candle that costs $400.
[01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:32.000]   Interesting how I never understood how Starlings and fish can school so well, but I feel like the tech industry is like that too. They swim in schools with products.
[01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:40.000]   For a while, it was this glut of Bluetooth speakers. You couldn't turn around without adding a Bluetooth speaker.
[01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:59.000]   I think they've somewhat been replaced now. Maybe I'm wrong, but I think they've somewhat been replaced by these. If you think about it, $100, even though you have to keep it plugged in, so yeah, when you go to your big beach trip in your VW van with all your buddies, you're going to have to bring a Bluetooth speaker.
[01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:18.000]   For the rest of the time, having this little, a little, a set candle-sized speaker that gives not awesome audio, but decent audio and has a voice assistant and all these other capabilities, I could see why people would choose that. That seems like a reasonable category.
[01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:32.000]   Another reason the price is important is because you end up wanting to have it in every room in your house, right? This is Apple looking at Amazon and saying, "Oh, yeah, you were smart to have all those cheap echoes because people just put it everywhere."
[01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:37.000]   How many Renee, do you have one in every room? How many would you have a few?
[01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:52.000]   I have two HomePod Biggies, one on each side of the television that because now with the latest version of AudioOS, you can dedicate them to the television. I have those instead of a sound bar, and I still use them for all the series stuff. I'm not the series stuff, all the HomePod stuff.
[01:05:52.000 --> 01:06:02.000]   I have two HomePod minis, one in my room and one ostensibly in my kitchen, but it's been sitting next to my recording stuff for the last month, so I can test different things.
[01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:13.000]   My problem is it's great, though. It really solves, like, people have had this problem with the AirPods Pro Max as well, trying to understand what they are, and they really are computational audio.
[01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:28.000]   They take the junkiest stuff that you get streaming off the internet, like MP3, AAC, and Bluetooth, and decompose it down to its bits, just like the Pixel camera does with images, and then rebuilds them better than the atoms have any right to be.
[01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:35.000]   And it's admirable technology that I hope destroys any complaints we have about Bluetooth in the future as it becomes mainstream.
[01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:47.000]   I just don't want to be a fish following the school. Now I have to get rid of all my Amazon Echoes and Google hubs and replace them with apples, and then next year what's it going to be.
[01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:57.000]   But it does feel like there is something to be said for having a HomePod mini in every room of the house and having it follow you around and giving you home music.
[01:06:57.000 --> 01:07:03.000]   I think there's a lot to be said for that, and I think the price is low enough. A few hundred bucks most people could do that.
[01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:11.000]   What's frustrating is that Amazon and Google are clearly ahead in assistance, and Apple and Google are clearly ahead in computational everything.
[01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:16.000]   Like Google has got better algorithms, Apple usually combines pretty good algorithms, pretty good hardware.
[01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:19.000]   Everybody else has pretty good hardware and lousy algorithms.
[01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:27.000]   So if you're willing to, if you think Google's deal is fair, you can get really good quality stuff both from the Assistant Den of the speaker.
[01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:37.000]   But if you have, and I'm glad we have this alternative, if you do have issues with Google or any or if you got from Facebook portal or something, at least Apple is giving you an alternative, which I think is valuable.
[01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:50.000]   All right, let's move into the future because the third announcement was not unexpected, but I think in the long run people are going to look back and say this was the year everything changed.
[01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:55.000]   Apple's announcement of M1 based Mac and Tush's.
[01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:58.000]   What do you think people happy?
[01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:02.000]   It seems like all the reviews are extremely positive.
[01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:06.000]   Yeah, I was very, very surprised.
[01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:19.000]   We all knew it was coming, but I was, if I had to put money on it, I would have put money on them putting out one model that is mostly for early adopters, and that there would be a lot of use cases in which the other ones are going to be.
[01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:31.000]   So, I think the case is in which this early model would be appropriate, but for the most part, we'd be advising people wait until 2021 when they put the real products into the product line.
[01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:48.000]   I don't think that any of us expected that we would be saying, nope, if you need a MacBook Air, or if you need a MacBook Pro that is has MacBook Air tendencies, by all means jump in right now, you won't regret it because it'll be much faster than whatever you would have bought by Apple.
[01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:55.000]   Whatever you would have bought by Intel this year, and there really does seem to be practically no trade-offs to doing it.
[01:08:55.000 --> 01:09:00.000]   So, yeah, it was a, I will say that it was a surprise to me that they pulled it off so well.
[01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:04.000]   And again, I put my money where my mouth is.
[01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:08.000]   I'm very, very happy with the purchase.
[01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:13.000]   Me too. Me too. Me three. Me four.
[01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:18.000]   And the more I see the reviews and so forth, the more I think they're really onto something.
[01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:23.000]   In fact, really, it's not so much what today's M1 based Macs mean.
[01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:27.000]   It's what that means for the future of Macintosh next year, the year after, the year after.
[01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:30.000]   I can't wait to have these are the ultra low power version.
[01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:34.000]   I don't think any of us can wait to see what they do with the middle eight and I'll buy a power version.
[01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:38.000]   And there was, you know, I mean, I think when they announced it in June, there was a question mark.
[01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:44.000]   Is Ken Apple pull this off? I had, I was very confident that they could, having done so three times before.
[01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:53.000]   But I feel like there was a reasonable concern is Rosetta two going to cover enough use cases that people don't feel like,
[01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:55.000]   Oh my God, what happened?
[01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:58.000]   And I think Apple in every respect showed that they could do it.
[01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:04.000]   There was also this issue, which was really a spurious issue of, oh, you don't want to buy the first M1s
[01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:09.000]   because, but they weren't the first M1s. They've been doing this since 2007.
[01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:15.000]   These were these were just a successor in a chip family that is actually very robust.
[01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:20.000]   It's been around for some time and gets better every single year.
[01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:26.000]   And I think everything that we were perhaps worried about fortunately has not happened.
[01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:28.000]   I mentioned when I'm, I got mine.
[01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:32.000]   The only issue I have found is these edge case developer tools and stuff.
[01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:39.000]   And I'm very happy to report it. Even in the intervening few weeks, the weird languages I use, the weird editors I use, things like that,
[01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:41.000]   all have been updated.
[01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:48.000]   And I think we're well on our way towards full compatibility in over the next year, let's say.
[01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:56.000]   Even just on article, it said, even Adobe Premiere runs better on the M1 Mac.
[01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:57.000]   Yeah.
[01:10:57.000 --> 01:11:04.000]   Anything on metal, one's better than it did on Intel, even if it was a compile tray Intel, which just, the pipeline is so good.
[01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:08.000]   It's a, it's a, now they also announced these new AirPod Macs.
[01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:11.000]   Jury's still out on those.
[01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:14.000]   It's hard to imagine that these will sell well at that price.
[01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:16.000]   Maybe Apple didn't really care.
[01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:20.000]   Anybody, they sold their capacity out through March.
[01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:24.000]   So yeah, we like the, as they could afford, they could make it.
[01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:27.000]   Yeah. As, as it's an audio item, but it's also a style item.
[01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:35.000]   And I think that kind of is what is what's driving the popularity is a very, very desirable thing to have.
[01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:37.000]   I guess I have no desire.
[01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:38.000]   I made a quick list.
[01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:52.000]   So like if you're, if you're all in on Apple, I mean, like you have an iPhone and an iPad and an Apple watch and likely a Mac and you want wireless headphones and you want them to be over the ear and you want them to be noise canceling.
[01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:56.000]   And $550 is just not an amount of money that you care about.
[01:11:56.000 --> 01:12:01.000]   These are probably the perfect headphones for you because what they do computationally is really impressive.
[01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:09.000]   Like they will take, I know garbage and garbage out is never the best solution, but you can feed them almost literal garbage and they'll make it sound better than it has any right to do.
[01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:12.000]   Like any right, like Bluetooth just shouldn't sound this way.
[01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:18.000]   And, but you have to be all in on Apple or they're going to be incredibly limited to very little value for you.
[01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:19.000]   I think that's, that's a good trick.
[01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:22.000]   That's an interesting, those boxes.
[01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:25.000]   Is that your positioning or is that something Apple positioned as is computational?
[01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:28.000]   I think, yeah, I think it's a good, it's a good take on it.
[01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:31.000]   Apple's thing was that these are like home pods.
[01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:33.000]   We designed them for people who want the best pot.
[01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:36.000]   Like the whole thing with the home pod is we designed it for people who have no audio.
[01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:38.000]   They don't want to get into audio.
[01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:39.000]   They don't know audio.
[01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:40.000]   They don't want to wire anything.
[01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:44.000]   They just want to drop a box in the room and have the best possible audio no matter where they're in the room.
[01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:50.000]   And their thing for the AirPods Max was like, these are for people who just want really good over the ear headphones.
[01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:57.000]   And they don't want to have to worry about where their music is coming from, what format it's in, what wireless protocol they're using, what codec they're using.
[01:12:57.000 --> 01:13:01.000]   They just want to be able to put on a pair of headphones and get really good sounding audio.
[01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:04.000]   And obviously they're in the Apple ecosystem.
[01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:13.000]   And if they are still not as expensive as you'd like them to be, Caviar is announced to Max Gold version for a mere $108,000.
[01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:16.000]   It'll be out sometime in 2021.
[01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:17.000]   They're not really doing much to it.
[01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:20.000]   Sure, just have them for two weeks and it's going to tell us what he thinks of them.
[01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:21.000]   They're plating it in gold.
[01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:26.000]   And honestly, that's a way too much for a gold plated pair of headphones.
[01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:31.000]   Well, wait, wait, wait, wait, do you see like the first set of like iced out headphones from like footballers?
[01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:33.000]   That's when you get to see this.
[01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:33.000]   Yeah.
[01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:34.000]   Yeah.
[01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:35.000]   Yep.
[01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:36.000]   Yep.
[01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:40.000]   My thing really with these is like if you take a photo with an iPhone or a Pixel phone, the sensor is embarrassing.
[01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:46.000]   Like compared to a Canon or Sony or a lake, like any real camera, it is a tiny, tiny pathetic sensor.
[01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:55.000]   And we get images out of that that we don't deserve to get because that's beyond the ability of the atoms because they bracket and they stack and they do all these computational tricks.
[01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:56.000]   And these are the same.
[01:13:56.000 --> 01:14:00.000]   You can get much cheaper wired headphones that sound better.
[01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:06.000]   You can get Bluetooth headphones that are much cheaper that don't sound better, you know, noise canceling ones at least.
[01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:12.000]   But these take audio signals that are legitimately terrible and give you really good audio from them.
[01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:13.000]   Yeah.
[01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:14.000]   Yeah.
[01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:20.000]   But I do think that you, your first statement was a very, very important one or the one that I really, really identified with.
[01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:27.000]   Like maybe I'm making this analogy because I was watching, I was binge watching Ink Master while I was cleaning the house this morning.
[01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:30.000]   But as one does.
[01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:31.000]   Yeah.
[01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:33.000]   It's actually, I like that show.
[01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:34.000]   It's kind of ratio.
[01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:44.000]   It's about, it's about, it is about, it is about, it is about, it is about, it is about tattooing.
[01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:48.000]   And you don't have any tattoos you could show us to you.
[01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:50.000]   Not on me, not right now.
[01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:52.000]   Maybe for my pick of the week I can go to the other.
[01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:57.000]   I think it's funny that somebody who is not inked is a fan of Ink Master.
[01:14:57.000 --> 01:15:02.000]   I will, well, again, this is a, we don't have any news so I will short, short diversion.
[01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:05.000]   I'm fascinated, A, it's a wonderful art form.
[01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:11.000]   B, it's an incredibly tricky art form where, no, you put down a line, you don't get to erase it.
[01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:14.000]   You have to deal with the line that you just put down there.
[01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:23.000]   And, but also in terms of like having a competition show in which there are, there are the tattoo artists.
[01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:24.000]   It's a competition.
[01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:28.000]   >> It's a competition show, but this is what I'm getting at.
[01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:32.000]   There are people who are fans of the show who will simply come in, like sign up to say,
[01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:35.000]   by the way, they don't know what tattoo they're going to be getting.
[01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:45.000]   Today, there's, it's an old school, it's an old school challenge and you have to do like an old school tattoo on, you know, old school style.
[01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:50.000]   The person who's coming in just knows that they're going to get a free six hour long tattoo,
[01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:52.000]   which would probably cause like $1,500.
[01:15:52.000 --> 01:16:00.000]   They get to discuss maybe a little bit what they're going to be, but essentially they get what they got and that's about it.
[01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:08.000]   And I'm fascinated by this idea of this decision of instead of choosing and spending months and months and months researching an artist
[01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:13.000]   and thinking very, very hard about what I want to add to my collections, like for life.
[01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:15.000]   >> No, I'm going to show up here.
[01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:18.000]   In the finale, I'm, okay, I will wind this up.
[01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:20.000]   I'm just, I'm kind of spinning up.
[01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:22.000]   >> I asked you, I asked you.
[01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:26.000]   >> There's, there's, okay, in the finale comes down to, of course, two people.
[01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:36.000]   This is one where they get to go back to their own home shops and they get 20, they get 24 hours cumulative to work on like their final presentation tattoo.
[01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:46.000]   But this is still a situation where someone is coming in and speaking, I think that like the, maybe they know they're getting like a head tattoo, a skull tattoo,
[01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:49.000]   but it's, I'm scared that they're getting a tattoo on their skull.
[01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:54.000]   But it's like, okay, this is my tribute to like my ory tattooing techniques.
[01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:56.000]   So the left side of your head is going to be a Maori woman.
[01:16:56.000 --> 01:16:59.000]   The right side of your head is going to be a Maori man.
[01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:10.000]   It's going to be a, okay, but did you, when you walked in, did you, when you answered that, that little ad on Craigslist, did you think you're going to be having two strangers faces on the sides of your head for the, and he went through with it.
[01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:15.000]   It was gorgeous work, but I'm like, you got to be all in, you know, you got to be all in.
[01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:22.000]   Yes, but I'm sorry to what I was getting at is that there are fans, there are fans of Apple, but then there are fans of Apple.
[01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:25.000]   There are fans of Apple who got an Apple tattoo.
[01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:34.000]   And then there are the fans of Apple who when Apple went from the six color to the solid logo, got that three go tattoo picked over in black.
[01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:38.000]   And these, the AirPods Max are for this third group of people.
[01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:39.000]   Yes.
[01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:41.000]   And the third group of people are not silly.
[01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:42.000]   I'm not saying.
[01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:43.000]   No.
[01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:51.000]   There are people that are so all in Apple that this is part of what pleases them about the Apple style, the way that it works so well with Apple products.
[01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:58.000]   It doesn't bother them that, well, what if I need to use, I want to use it with my, with a different streaming box and listen to TV.
[01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:00.000]   So that's the sort of people as forance.
[01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:09.000]   And there are enough people out there that obviously when you can't, no product can be deemed a failure when they're unobtainable until March.
[01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:15.000]   That's, yeah, and that's a pretty indication that they found their market for this.
[01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:16.000]   Yeah.
[01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:22.000]   Incidentally, this was the year Apple turned privacy up on iOS 14.
[01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:32.000]   This was also the year Facebook took out full page ads in some of the major newspapers in the United States saying Apple, it's bad for small businesses.
[01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:33.000]   What are you doing?
[01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:35.000]   Oh, the ponies are these people.
[01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:40.000]   I mean, the text is like, don't worry small businesses.
[01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:43.000]   We've heard your cries and we're here to fight your battle for us.
[01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:48.000]   We won't let you, Apple, mean old Apple, burn you into the ground.
[01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:56.000]   But it's mean policies of informing users that tracking technology is going to be functioning when you're from app to app to app.
[01:18:56.000 --> 01:18:58.000]   Like, oh, man.
[01:18:58.000 --> 01:18:59.000]   And Apple's response was great.
[01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:00.000]   He said, go ahead.
[01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:02.000]   We're not saying you can't do it.
[01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:03.000]   You just have to ask people.
[01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:09.000]   You just have to tell them what's wrong with that because we know everybody knows everybody will know.
[01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:11.000]   I don't want you to do that.
[01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:12.000]   Yeah.
[01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:14.000]   No, that's not a good idea.
[01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:15.000]   What?
[01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:16.000]   What?
[01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:18.000]   So good for you, Apple.
[01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:19.000]   Good for you.
[01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:21.000]   Banner year.
[01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:23.000]   Great success all around.
[01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:27.000]   Have I left any big stories from 2020 out?
[01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:29.000]   I just have to say Apple deserves.
[01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:30.000]   Apple car got pushed Leo.
[01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:31.000]   It's fine.
[01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:32.000]   The Apple car got pushed to lead.
[01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:33.000]   Oh, oh my God.
[01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:34.000]   That's good.
[01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:35.000]   Okay.
[01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:38.000]   So the next segment will do some of the stories that have happened since we've met last.
[01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:39.000]   That's one of them.
[01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:42.000]   The Apple car, it'll be out in 2022, 2023.
[01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:44.000]   It'll be out in 2024, 2020.
[01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:47.000]   The last one I saw is 2028.
[01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:49.000]   It's like, told it.
[01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:51.000]   It's like what?
[01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:55.000]   What kind of rumor is, Millie, you guys running around here?
[01:19:55.000 --> 01:19:58.000]   Take a year and stay with him.
[01:19:58.000 --> 01:19:59.000]   Nobody's going to.
[01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:03.000]   Anyway, that was paying attention until it got to about 2025.
[01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:05.000]   And I thought, well, I know.
[01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:06.000]   Yeah, 2028.
[01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:08.000]   I was just on down.
[01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:09.000]   It's hysterical.
[01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:13.000]   I was watching that number go up and up and up and up.
[01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:15.000]   We're just kind of covering the year.
[01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:17.000]   It's like it's the end of the year.
[01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:20.000]   Get together with two of my favorite people, Andy and not go.
[01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:21.000]   WGBH in Boston.
[01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:26.000]   Are you going to take a little break on GBH for a while or when are you going to be back on?
[01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:31.000]   This week is off because of the holiday, but back on next Thursday at 1 p.m.
[01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:32.000]   All right.
[01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:33.000]   All right.
[01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:36.000]   Enocho.com, I H N A T K O.
[01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:41.000]   Renee Richie is a YouTube star in his own right at youtube.com/Renee Richie.
[01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:43.000]   Guilty as charged.
[01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:45.000]   R R at Renee Richie.
[01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:50.000]   How are you doing all alone in freezing cold Montreal?
[01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:51.000]   Is everything you're doing?
[01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:53.000]   Did you get together with family over the holidays?
[01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:56.000]   I didn't ask you what you get to do.
[01:20:56.000 --> 01:21:00.000]   No, because my family has scattered a little bit and none of us were going to travel, so
[01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:01.000]   we did the Zoom thing.
[01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:02.000]   Yeah.
[01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:03.000]   Different groups and different Zoom.
[01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:07.000]   Did you at least have a good bagel?
[01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:15.000]   I did not have a good bagel, but I put together not an not co-quality level, but I put together
[01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:22.000]   an in-no-co-style feast where I cooked up something and then had it as my holiday meal for the
[01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:23.000]   next three days.
[01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:24.000]   It was fun.
[01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:27.000]   I had all these plans.
[01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:30.000]   And then I got food poisoning on day one of the vacation.
[01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:31.000]   Oh, yeah.
[01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:35.000]   And I didn't emerge from bed for like seven days.
[01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:41.000]   In fact, really, this is the first time I've gone to a house pretty much.
[01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:42.760]   So I got nothing done.
[01:21:42.760 --> 01:21:45.120]   I didn't really, I think Christmas happened.
[01:21:45.120 --> 01:21:47.000]   I don't remember it.
[01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:48.000]   I didn't get to cook.
[01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:51.600]   I had all these delicious meals I was going to make and all that stuff.
[01:21:51.600 --> 01:21:55.600]   So don't know.
[01:21:55.600 --> 01:21:59.760]   Sorry.
[01:21:59.760 --> 01:22:02.800]   But it sounds like all three of us had Christmas interrupters.
[01:22:02.800 --> 01:22:05.840]   Well, it was a good Christmas.
[01:22:05.840 --> 01:22:07.000]   It was still a good Christmas.
[01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:08.000]   I watched a lot.
[01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:09.000]   I still had families.
[01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:10.000]   Yeah.
[01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:11.000]   Yeah.
[01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:12.800]   And sometimes that's what defines a really good Christmas.
[01:22:12.800 --> 01:22:14.600]   That's really all you need.
[01:22:14.600 --> 01:22:23.080]   I'm just saying that again, the salmon that I made for like dinner at one PM was fantastic.
[01:22:23.080 --> 01:22:24.080]   Yeah.
[01:22:24.080 --> 01:22:28.080]   I had a pork roast and pumpkin tortellini like ready to go for dinner.
[01:22:28.080 --> 01:22:31.840]   But at four o'clock, I decided that I don't really want to put I don't want to pork roast
[01:22:31.840 --> 01:22:34.240]   and pumpkin tortellini in the next two hours.
[01:22:34.240 --> 01:22:38.560]   So I canceled the pumpkin tortellini in the pork roast.
[01:22:38.560 --> 01:22:40.360]   No, and no one wigged out.
[01:22:40.360 --> 01:22:41.360]   It was perfectly fine.
[01:22:41.360 --> 01:22:43.360]   Sometimes you wanted the beauties of that.
[01:22:43.360 --> 01:22:45.200]   Yeah, that's one of the beauties of that.
[01:22:45.200 --> 01:22:46.200]   People aren't coming.
[01:22:46.200 --> 01:22:49.040]   They're not going to knock at your door at three in the afternoon saying, "Where's our
[01:22:49.040 --> 01:22:50.040]   turkey?"
[01:22:50.040 --> 01:22:51.040]   No, it's fine.
[01:22:51.040 --> 01:22:52.040]   And I still have this one.
[01:22:52.040 --> 01:22:53.040]   I know it could be my fridge.
[01:22:53.040 --> 01:22:57.680]   But this could be grandma's last Christmas and you're going to have her last Christmas
[01:22:57.680 --> 01:23:04.080]   without the watermelon fondue that she brought from the old country.
[01:23:04.080 --> 01:23:05.080]   Oh, God.
[01:23:05.080 --> 01:23:09.760]   Hey, what you do celebrate the Eastern European Christmas still, right?
[01:23:09.760 --> 01:23:11.760]   Yes, I do.
[01:23:11.760 --> 01:23:16.680]   I don't have to look up at the data, but it's usually like 10 days after the regular Christmas
[01:23:16.680 --> 01:23:18.920]   or excuse me, the regular.
[01:23:18.920 --> 01:23:20.880]   So you get a second one.
[01:23:20.880 --> 01:23:21.880]   It's nice.
[01:23:21.880 --> 01:23:23.920]   Yeah, actually, it's like having a place.
[01:23:23.920 --> 01:23:24.920]   Right.
[01:23:24.920 --> 01:23:25.920]   It's lower key.
[01:23:25.920 --> 01:23:28.680]   It's usually ham and pierogies, but it also means that like...
[01:23:28.680 --> 01:23:30.760]   Oh, it's January 7th this year.
[01:23:30.760 --> 01:23:31.760]   Yep.
[01:23:31.760 --> 01:23:33.320]   So it's a long way off.
[01:23:33.320 --> 01:23:34.320]   Yeah.
[01:23:34.320 --> 01:23:36.400]   So that's why like I can keep the...
[01:23:36.400 --> 01:23:37.400]   I can...
[01:23:37.400 --> 01:23:40.720]   It's okay if I put the tree up like on the 23rd or the 24th because I was lazy.
[01:23:40.720 --> 01:23:43.840]   It didn't get around to it because, oh, well, no, it's...
[01:23:43.840 --> 01:23:50.960]   I'm honoring both of my grandparents' sets of heritage by putting it up before the Catholic
[01:23:50.960 --> 01:23:56.200]   Christmas, but then taking it down after the Orthodox Christmas, I guess.
[01:23:56.200 --> 01:24:00.480]   No, it's not because I'm a grown adult who doesn't get his stuff together, but...
[01:24:00.480 --> 01:24:04.000]   Well, at least you have something to look forward to.
[01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:09.800]   The rest of us just a long, grim, freezing cold winter with no redeeming features.
[01:24:09.800 --> 01:24:10.800]   You do virtual CES.
[01:24:10.800 --> 01:24:11.800]   Oh, I'll...
[01:24:11.800 --> 01:24:14.240]   Oh, can you guys sign up for CES?
[01:24:14.240 --> 01:24:15.240]   No.
[01:24:15.240 --> 01:24:16.240]   No, wait.
[01:24:16.240 --> 01:24:17.240]   I'm picking this year off.
[01:24:17.240 --> 01:24:18.240]   Yeah.
[01:24:18.240 --> 01:24:21.320]   Well, my pick of the week this week actually has to do with CES.
[01:24:21.320 --> 01:24:22.320]   Last year's CES.
[01:24:22.320 --> 01:24:24.000]   All right.
[01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:30.040]   Let's continue on because we now have a few stories, not many, but a few stories that
[01:24:30.040 --> 01:24:32.560]   happened since our last get together.
[01:24:32.560 --> 01:24:34.120]   Number one was the apple car.
[01:24:34.120 --> 01:24:39.040]   By the way, the latest update on that is Goldman Sachs says, "No, they're not making
[01:24:39.040 --> 01:24:40.040]   a car."
[01:24:40.040 --> 01:24:42.680]   Why is this...
[01:24:42.680 --> 01:24:47.760]   Renee, why is this the story that just will never die?
[01:24:47.760 --> 01:24:48.760]   Because everyone...
[01:24:48.760 --> 01:24:54.640]   I mean, when you look at the sources of this information, they are either industry rags
[01:24:54.640 --> 01:24:57.440]   that all they want to do is position components for sale.
[01:24:57.440 --> 01:24:59.400]   They're basically open bidding.
[01:24:59.400 --> 01:25:02.740]   You see this a lot in Korean and Chinese papers, and then you have people like Ming
[01:25:02.740 --> 01:25:07.840]   Chikwul and people like Barclays and Goldman Sachs, which are investor-oriented.
[01:25:07.840 --> 01:25:11.400]   They're financial analysts, and they want to make sure that the market moves in ways
[01:25:11.400 --> 01:25:13.000]   that benefit their clients.
[01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:15.680]   Now this story was broken by Reuters, right?
[01:25:15.680 --> 01:25:18.080]   I think this is a Reuters story.
[01:25:18.080 --> 01:25:20.840]   Yeah, so the China Daily had it first, and they said it was coming this year, like in
[01:25:20.840 --> 01:25:21.840]   2021.
[01:25:21.840 --> 01:25:22.840]   Oh, crap.
[01:25:22.840 --> 01:25:24.560]   And then Reuters said, "No, it's like 2024."
[01:25:24.560 --> 01:25:29.520]   And then, Woming Chi said, "No, 2027."
[01:25:29.520 --> 01:25:32.480]   And all they're doing is like, "Everyone wants to know what's next from Apple."
[01:25:32.480 --> 01:25:35.280]   As soon as the iPad came out, all we did was talk about the Apple Watch.
[01:25:35.280 --> 01:25:38.120]   And then when the Apple Watch came out, where's the smart speaker?
[01:25:38.120 --> 01:25:41.040]   Is a lot of money to be made selling and buying?
[01:25:41.040 --> 01:25:43.720]   Apple shares based on the rumors of what's going to be next.
[01:25:43.720 --> 01:25:50.960]   So there's no reason for me, for instance, to put off my order, my Mach-E Ford Mustang,
[01:25:50.960 --> 01:25:52.880]   and wait for the Apple car.
[01:25:52.880 --> 01:25:54.280]   Is you what you're saying?
[01:25:54.280 --> 01:25:55.920]   No, not at all.
[01:25:55.920 --> 01:25:58.440]   Not until wait a second.
[01:25:58.440 --> 01:26:03.440]   The only reason I could think of is all of the viral YouTube videos of Mustang spinning
[01:26:03.440 --> 01:26:06.800]   out after coming out of cars and coffee.
[01:26:06.800 --> 01:26:11.040]   So you might get a little bit of razzing for that.
[01:26:11.040 --> 01:26:14.160]   Other than that, other than that.
[01:26:14.160 --> 01:26:19.000]   So that was just a hysterical story that I was almost glad that we didn't have any
[01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:25.680]   Mac break weeklies because it was just every time I saw a link, there was a new date.
[01:26:25.680 --> 01:26:28.720]   So I thought, "Well, we'll just wait till this settles down a little bit and it's settled
[01:26:28.720 --> 01:26:29.720]   down."
[01:26:29.720 --> 01:26:30.720]   Nothing.
[01:26:30.720 --> 01:26:34.280]   There's nothing wrong in admitting or, excuse me, I'm not speaking for anybody else, but
[01:26:34.280 --> 01:26:39.400]   I admit that I don't know why Apple would ever want to do a car.
[01:26:39.400 --> 01:26:43.120]   I don't know if they're even planning to really do a car.
[01:26:43.120 --> 01:26:44.880]   It costs me nothing to admit that.
[01:26:44.880 --> 01:26:51.400]   I will be pleased to look at it if they were to actually put one on a stage during an event.
[01:26:51.400 --> 01:26:55.400]   But until then, I'm not going to believe anything that I read anywhere about any Apple car.
[01:26:55.400 --> 01:26:56.400]   Yeah.
[01:26:56.400 --> 01:26:59.360]   Really, the only reason it's a big, well, no, I know why it's a big story.
[01:26:59.360 --> 01:27:04.000]   But the reason it's a story for us and for me is it would show an interest by Apple in
[01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:08.800]   something that is so far afield that, I mean, that's kind of interesting.
[01:27:08.800 --> 01:27:10.280]   Factoid, I guess.
[01:27:10.280 --> 01:27:13.560]   Well, Jeff Williams said it's the ultimate mobile device and then I think Apple PR almost
[01:27:13.560 --> 01:27:15.400]   chopped him off the stage.
[01:27:15.400 --> 01:27:18.240]   No, it's not.
[01:27:18.240 --> 01:27:21.160]   No, it's not.
[01:27:21.160 --> 01:27:26.880]   While we were gone, both Firefox and Google announced versions of their browsers that are
[01:27:26.880 --> 01:27:30.120]   native to the Apple Silicon CPUs.
[01:27:30.120 --> 01:27:31.120]   That's really good news.
[01:27:31.120 --> 01:27:33.680]   You can use your preferred browser.
[01:27:33.680 --> 01:27:41.080]   I think Safari still has the edge in terms of JavaScript performance and so forth, but
[01:27:41.080 --> 01:27:42.520]   in battery life for sure.
[01:27:42.520 --> 01:27:46.680]   But at least Chrome and Firefox are now native.
[01:27:46.680 --> 01:27:47.680]   So that's good news.
[01:27:47.680 --> 01:27:51.360]   And there's some sites that just won't work like you'll go there and Safari, anything
[01:27:51.360 --> 01:27:53.240]   using WebKit and it'll say not compatible.
[01:27:53.240 --> 01:27:54.640]   And then you'll say, of course, it's compatible.
[01:27:54.640 --> 01:27:56.840]   You're just being a jerk and you'll have to launch Brave or something.
[01:27:56.840 --> 01:28:01.360]   And just keep it around just in case.
[01:28:01.360 --> 01:28:05.760]   The story that has been bubbling along for the last six months and it continues to bubble
[01:28:05.760 --> 01:28:13.120]   along the issue of forced labor in the use of iPhone suppliers, parts.
[01:28:13.120 --> 01:28:21.760]   And now the most recent one is lens technology and iPhone glass supplier.
[01:28:21.760 --> 01:28:27.680]   In the Washington Post, they've been accused of using forced Muslim labor in the factories,
[01:28:27.680 --> 01:28:32.320]   the Uighurs, according to documents uncovered by a human rights group adding new scrutiny
[01:28:32.320 --> 01:28:34.400]   to Apple's human rights record in China.
[01:28:34.400 --> 01:28:37.760]   That story broke today or yesterday.
[01:28:37.760 --> 01:28:43.720]   The documents discovered by the tech transparency project and shared exclusively the post detail
[01:28:43.720 --> 01:28:51.320]   how thousands of Uighur workers were sent to work for lens technology and given a choice.
[01:28:51.320 --> 01:29:00.400]   They said, okay, you can either work in this factory or you can go back to the labor camp.
[01:29:00.400 --> 01:29:05.280]   Apple said the company has confirmed that lens technology has not, they denied it completely,
[01:29:05.280 --> 01:29:09.640]   has not received any labor transfers of Uighur workers from the Xinjiang.
[01:29:09.640 --> 01:29:14.240]   He said Apple earlier this year ensured none of its other suppliers are using forced-weager
[01:29:14.240 --> 01:29:15.600]   labor.
[01:29:15.600 --> 01:29:19.000]   Apple has zero tolerance for forced labor looking for the presence of forced labor as
[01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:24.360]   part of every supplier assessment we conduct, including surprise audits.
[01:29:24.360 --> 01:29:31.840]   So Apple very aggressively defended its use and its practices and said there is no forced
[01:29:31.840 --> 01:29:34.160]   labor in the chain.
[01:29:34.160 --> 01:29:37.080]   It's a story that keeps coming up.
[01:29:37.080 --> 01:29:41.800]   So we'll just keep following it, I guess.
[01:29:41.800 --> 01:29:42.800]   Yeah.
[01:29:42.800 --> 01:29:48.200]   Apple is doing better than most any other large company that uses Chinese manufacturing.
[01:29:48.200 --> 01:29:53.840]   That said, they are absolutely required to be as transparent as they can humanly be with
[01:29:53.840 --> 01:29:57.720]   the public about how they use labor in China and how they make sure that they keep their
[01:29:57.720 --> 01:30:01.480]   supply chain as uncontaminated by slave labor as possible.
[01:30:01.480 --> 01:30:03.480]   So I have faith in Apple.
[01:30:03.480 --> 01:30:09.440]   I do believe that when they say that they conducted a sweep and that their routine rules
[01:30:09.440 --> 01:30:13.720]   and regulations block this sort of thing from happening.
[01:30:13.720 --> 01:30:17.920]   However, they are absolutely required, given the people they're dealing with, to keep making
[01:30:17.920 --> 01:30:22.000]   sure that they release these reports that every time there's an accusation, they don't
[01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:25.920]   just get all huffy about it, but they say here is why we looked at, we looked into the
[01:30:25.920 --> 01:30:26.920]   specific allegation.
[01:30:26.920 --> 01:30:28.120]   Here is what we found.
[01:30:28.120 --> 01:30:29.120]   We found nothing.
[01:30:29.120 --> 01:30:33.880]   And here is how here is the data that we turned up that proves, excuse me, that demonstrated
[01:30:33.880 --> 01:30:38.240]   to our to our satisfaction that there is no forced labor being used in the production
[01:30:38.240 --> 01:30:39.320]   of any iPhone component.
[01:30:39.320 --> 01:30:41.800]   It's very, very tricky, but they have to do it.
[01:30:41.800 --> 01:30:42.800]   Yeah.
[01:30:42.800 --> 01:30:46.440]   And I'm open to, you know, hearing from both sides, but I have to say this reminds me a
[01:30:46.440 --> 01:30:50.280]   little bit of what happened with Greenpeace, where they can see because Apple is such a
[01:30:50.280 --> 01:30:59.320]   high profile company and has such lefty customers at least here in California, that the Greenpeace
[01:30:59.320 --> 01:31:03.840]   got a lot of made a lot of hay attacking Apple, putting them on their lists of the worst.
[01:31:03.840 --> 01:31:06.880]   And then all of a sudden, oh, no, they're fine now.
[01:31:06.880 --> 01:31:10.080]   And I says, you know, I don't know what the tech, I don't know.
[01:31:10.080 --> 01:31:12.960]   I think about the tech transparency project.
[01:31:12.960 --> 01:31:16.040]   It's important that this information come out if it's the case.
[01:31:16.040 --> 01:31:17.320]   Yeah, this is a case.
[01:31:17.320 --> 01:31:21.640]   Well, I'll say that it were, I don't want to say like by any means necessary, but whatever
[01:31:21.640 --> 01:31:24.480]   can get more information out about this, please, please do it.
[01:31:24.480 --> 01:31:28.880]   If Apple has to file every report imaginable and we can getting news about this, that's
[01:31:28.880 --> 01:31:29.880]   fine.
[01:31:29.880 --> 01:31:34.760]   And I have absolute faith that Apple does not want to employ forced labor in any of its
[01:31:34.760 --> 01:31:35.760]   production.
[01:31:35.760 --> 01:31:36.760]   Absolutely.
[01:31:36.760 --> 01:31:39.560]   And would do anything to prevent that.
[01:31:39.560 --> 01:31:42.880]   They're not so profit focused that they would say, well, sorry.
[01:31:42.880 --> 01:31:43.880]   We got to.
[01:31:43.880 --> 01:31:45.280]   That's just not the case.
[01:31:45.280 --> 01:31:46.280]   Yeah.
[01:31:46.280 --> 01:31:54.200]   With Google is, Google is having some, some absolutely dannable crises with how they
[01:31:54.200 --> 01:31:57.000]   treat some of their, the people who work for them.
[01:31:57.000 --> 01:32:00.800]   And it's, and part of the problem is that clearly they see the problem as a PR problem
[01:32:00.800 --> 01:32:02.280]   when the news gets out.
[01:32:02.280 --> 01:32:07.280]   With Apple, I do believe that, I know I'm absolutely certain that they don't believe
[01:32:07.280 --> 01:32:11.080]   this issue is a PR problem that has to be tamped down.
[01:32:11.080 --> 01:32:15.440]   They believe that it is an actual human rights problem that they want to not only have nothing
[01:32:15.440 --> 01:32:19.880]   to, not only, not only do they want to have nothing to do with profiting from this practice,
[01:32:19.880 --> 01:32:23.840]   but they want to do everything that is humanly possible for a company to just wait to make
[01:32:23.840 --> 01:32:25.600]   sure that this does not happen under their watch.
[01:32:25.600 --> 01:32:26.600]   Yeah.
[01:32:26.600 --> 01:32:27.600]   So I have a lot of faith in Apple.
[01:32:27.600 --> 01:32:28.880]   That's on that score.
[01:32:28.880 --> 01:32:35.120]   And we will continue to make sure that they do the best they can because they want to and
[01:32:35.120 --> 01:32:36.920]   we want them to.
[01:32:36.920 --> 01:32:38.920]   Yes.
[01:32:38.920 --> 01:32:41.240]   Anything else? Let's see.
[01:32:41.240 --> 01:32:47.200]   There was a riot in India underpaid workers at an Apple affiliated factory.
[01:32:47.200 --> 01:32:50.000]   They kept reducing the already low wages.
[01:32:50.000 --> 01:32:55.120]   So the factory workers riot and took all the iPhones, serves them right.
[01:32:55.120 --> 01:33:01.360]   I don't see anything of great import.
[01:33:01.360 --> 01:33:04.960]   What are we looking forward to in 2021?
[01:33:04.960 --> 01:33:12.040]   There's a chance for you guys to think, sit back, not be exactly a Ming Chi Ho, but wonderful
[01:33:12.040 --> 01:33:17.000]   gift gif of that dog in the burning room just sipping coffee, saying everything's fine.
[01:33:17.000 --> 01:33:18.000]   Yeah.
[01:33:18.000 --> 01:33:22.120]   With a burly firefighter who grabbed it and was running with it out the door.
[01:33:22.120 --> 01:33:24.240]   And that is just all my hopes and dreams.
[01:33:24.240 --> 01:33:27.120]   Please, firefighter, rescue us.
[01:33:27.120 --> 01:33:29.520]   Or coffee, everything is fine.
[01:33:29.520 --> 01:33:30.880]   It's being rescued.
[01:33:30.880 --> 01:33:31.880]   Yeah.
[01:33:31.880 --> 01:33:34.360]   I think we all see the light at the end of the tunnel.
[01:33:34.360 --> 01:33:35.800]   The vaccine is rolling out.
[01:33:35.800 --> 01:33:39.320]   There are at least two, maybe three coming soon.
[01:33:39.320 --> 01:33:45.320]   And I have to say in what has been a very difficult year, Apple's done very well.
[01:33:45.320 --> 01:33:50.680]   I think there's a lot to look forward to believe it or not with a Macintosh.
[01:33:50.680 --> 01:33:53.040]   You know, this is going to be very exciting.
[01:33:53.040 --> 01:33:54.040]   Yeah.
[01:33:54.040 --> 01:33:55.040]   Huh?
[01:33:55.040 --> 01:33:56.680]   They got a mini LED.
[01:33:56.680 --> 01:33:58.160]   Everything is like, oh, that's right.
[01:33:58.160 --> 01:34:00.520]   There is a rumor that there is a mini LED.
[01:34:00.520 --> 01:34:01.600]   I did not mention that.
[01:34:01.600 --> 01:34:08.480]   I Airpad, I'm sorry, iPad Pro coming out in the spring and Max and the Max two.
[01:34:08.480 --> 01:34:09.840]   That will be very exciting.
[01:34:09.840 --> 01:34:10.840]   Yeah.
[01:34:10.840 --> 01:34:11.840]   Yeah.
[01:34:11.840 --> 01:34:12.840]   Yeah.
[01:34:12.840 --> 01:34:13.840]   It's going to be fun.
[01:34:13.840 --> 01:34:19.320]   Like we said earlier, the single Mac thing that I'm, excuse me, I'm sorry, the single
[01:34:19.320 --> 01:34:25.880]   Apple thing I'm most looking forward to is the first time that Apple, Apple says, okay,
[01:34:25.880 --> 01:34:29.160]   what if we don't care about power, we don't care about power consumption.
[01:34:29.160 --> 01:34:30.160]   Yeah.
[01:34:30.160 --> 01:34:31.160]   Really?
[01:34:31.160 --> 01:34:34.680]   We don't even necessarily care so much about fan noise.
[01:34:34.680 --> 01:34:42.200]   Exactly how much butt can we spank on the AMD and the Intel fight with the most powerful
[01:34:42.200 --> 01:34:44.480]   Mac we've ever made.
[01:34:44.480 --> 01:34:47.680]   That's going to be something really, really entertaining to watch.
[01:34:47.680 --> 01:34:48.680]   Yeah.
[01:34:48.680 --> 01:34:50.240]   I hope I live long enough to see it.
[01:34:50.240 --> 01:34:51.240]   Yeah.
[01:34:51.240 --> 01:34:52.240]   128 core Mac Pro.
[01:34:52.240 --> 01:34:53.240]   Just drop that down.
[01:34:53.240 --> 01:34:55.680]   No low, low, low power cores.
[01:34:55.680 --> 01:34:56.680]   Come on.
[01:34:56.680 --> 01:34:57.680]   That's room on the die.
[01:34:57.680 --> 01:35:00.120]   We could put more high power cores on.
[01:35:00.120 --> 01:35:05.560]   And we get four low power cores and then you get a hundred and twenty four of you.
[01:35:05.560 --> 01:35:10.160]   We started the year saying, sorry, the show saying the year was a good year for tech
[01:35:10.160 --> 01:35:12.280]   companies in the stock market.
[01:35:12.280 --> 01:35:16.880]   Apple had 88% growth in its stock for 2020.
[01:35:16.880 --> 01:35:22.480]   So if you bought Apple at the beginning of the year, congratulations and held it.
[01:35:22.480 --> 01:35:23.480]   Congratulations.
[01:35:23.480 --> 01:35:25.240]   It's similar to what Andy said earlier.
[01:35:25.240 --> 01:35:28.560]   I was always taught like you couldn't cover a company and hold their shares and I always
[01:35:28.560 --> 01:35:31.160]   get angrier every year that I was trained that way.
[01:35:31.160 --> 01:35:35.200]   And I finally like the US government is like to give you a good idea of Congress people
[01:35:35.200 --> 01:35:40.400]   and senators and get their own stock over it.
[01:35:40.400 --> 01:35:43.920]   If I ever do get a tattoo as probably one of the candidates is going to be just simply
[01:35:43.920 --> 01:35:46.320]   the number 12 and seven eights.
[01:35:46.320 --> 01:35:51.600]   That's the price that Apple was at when I was just like, oh, vibrating like thinking
[01:35:51.600 --> 01:35:52.600]   that.
[01:35:52.600 --> 01:35:58.120]   But I know that I know that I'm a print journalist, which means that I have no money, but I have
[01:35:58.120 --> 01:36:02.520]   a thousand dollars, a couple of thousand dollars that I was going to spend like on fun
[01:36:02.520 --> 01:36:03.520]   things over the next three.
[01:36:03.520 --> 01:36:06.960]   I could buy Apple stock and just put it away and hold on to it.
[01:36:06.960 --> 01:36:13.560]   And oh my God, it was like again, my, my soul is my strength is as the strength of 10 men
[01:36:13.560 --> 01:36:15.880]   because my soul is pure.
[01:36:15.880 --> 01:36:16.880]   Damn it.
[01:36:16.880 --> 01:36:20.280]   My only way I get around that is my retirement fund.
[01:36:20.280 --> 01:36:25.040]   Some of them are in a basket of tech stocks.
[01:36:25.040 --> 01:36:29.200]   So I bought the tech technology market as a whole, knowing there's probably a little
[01:36:29.200 --> 01:36:30.200]   Apple in there.
[01:36:30.200 --> 01:36:32.160]   Imagine and some other stuff that we covered.
[01:36:32.160 --> 01:36:33.160]   I have mutual funds.
[01:36:33.160 --> 01:36:34.160]   That's a mutual fund.
[01:36:34.160 --> 01:36:35.160]   Never tell me what's in them.
[01:36:35.160 --> 01:36:36.160]   I don't want to know.
[01:36:36.160 --> 01:36:37.160]   Yeah.
[01:36:37.160 --> 01:36:38.160]   Why them and sell them?
[01:36:38.160 --> 01:36:40.480]   I just don't want to know because there'll be like cell phone companies.
[01:36:40.480 --> 01:36:41.640]   There'll be technology companies.
[01:36:41.640 --> 01:36:42.640]   Yeah.
[01:36:42.640 --> 01:36:45.320]   It's stuff that I, yeah, but I don't manage it.
[01:36:45.320 --> 01:36:46.760]   It's a mutual fund.
[01:36:46.760 --> 01:36:51.080]   And I don't think there's anything wrong with me investing in technology as a whole, right?
[01:36:51.080 --> 01:36:54.840]   That's kind of my whole life is invested in technology.
[01:36:54.840 --> 01:36:59.960]   As a whole, maybe the, it's actually a bad idea because I'm putting all my eggs in the
[01:36:59.960 --> 01:37:08.120]   technology basket, but I do feel like this has been a good year for technology.
[01:37:08.120 --> 01:37:12.360]   It's been a tough year because technology has also come under the scrutiny, big tech
[01:37:12.360 --> 01:37:18.040]   has, but our company, the company we cover, Apple of all the big tech companies seems
[01:37:18.040 --> 01:37:20.080]   to be the cutliest.
[01:37:20.080 --> 01:37:25.240]   And so there's a, there's a, it's a nice, it's a nice feeling to cover, to cover Apple.
[01:37:25.240 --> 01:37:30.000]   I cannot believe Google is getting sued over the 30% before Apple didn't.
[01:37:30.000 --> 01:37:31.840]   Ah, isn't that ironic?
[01:37:31.840 --> 01:37:32.840]   That ironic.
[01:37:32.840 --> 01:37:33.840]   All right.
[01:37:33.840 --> 01:37:38.120]   I think not the, not, not the greatest problem that Sundar Pritche is dealing with at this
[01:37:38.120 --> 01:37:39.120]   moment.
[01:37:39.120 --> 01:37:44.320]   No, no, he is, he is the dog with a coffee cup and he can't even crack a smile.
[01:37:44.320 --> 01:37:49.360]   As good as this year has been for Apple, it's as bad as it's been for Google.
[01:37:49.360 --> 01:37:52.680]   And it really just seems like Google just lost their way this year.
[01:37:52.680 --> 01:37:56.000]   They just, you know, I have to say another company that's done very well this year is
[01:37:56.000 --> 01:38:01.600]   Microsoft, not maybe as beautifully as Apple and I do think there is certain irony at the
[01:38:01.600 --> 01:38:05.160]   years end that Microsoft said, Oh, and we're going to do our custom chip too.
[01:38:05.160 --> 01:38:06.160]   It's going to be an arm chip.
[01:38:06.160 --> 01:38:07.160]   Yeah, we're going to do that.
[01:38:07.160 --> 01:38:08.160]   Yeah.
[01:38:08.160 --> 01:38:09.160]   Yeah.
[01:38:09.160 --> 01:38:10.160]   Yeah.
[01:38:10.160 --> 01:38:11.160]   Yeah.
[01:38:11.160 --> 01:38:16.120]   We got that as they always do as they do that every time you got an iPad.
[01:38:16.120 --> 01:38:18.600]   Oh, wait, we have this giant surface tablet.
[01:38:18.600 --> 01:38:20.440]   This is, this is like an iPad only.
[01:38:20.440 --> 01:38:24.200]   It's a coffee table size every single time.
[01:38:24.200 --> 01:38:28.080]   Hey, Google's been making server chips on arm for years and never talks like I'll be
[01:38:28.080 --> 01:38:29.080]   ever talks about that.
[01:38:29.080 --> 01:38:31.200]   No, we don't want to, we're too tired.
[01:38:31.200 --> 01:38:34.360]   I mean, we don't want to talk about that snap time.
[01:38:34.360 --> 01:38:35.360]   All right.
[01:38:35.360 --> 01:38:39.240]   I am getting ready for some picks of the week because even though it's the end of the year,
[01:38:39.240 --> 01:38:41.600]   you don't get off the hook.
[01:38:41.600 --> 01:38:45.040]   Our picks of the week, let's commence.
[01:38:45.040 --> 01:38:49.680]   And by the way, I should point out it could be a media content.
[01:38:49.680 --> 01:38:51.400]   Andy knows that you often pick opera.
[01:38:51.400 --> 01:38:52.400]   Of course.
[01:38:52.400 --> 01:38:54.040]   It could be, it could be anything.
[01:38:54.040 --> 01:38:56.640]   What is your pick of the week, Andy and not go?
[01:38:56.640 --> 01:39:01.160]   My pick of the week, again, I, I forgot that we had a show today's, but I did, but I did
[01:39:01.160 --> 01:39:04.720]   have one that I had already bookmarked for a future show.
[01:39:04.720 --> 01:39:10.240]   It's an app called no one knew you forgot the show until you just admitted it.
[01:39:10.240 --> 01:39:12.760]   Think of again, again, I was going away with the not.
[01:39:12.760 --> 01:39:16.800]   I was in the strength of 10 men for my soul is pure.
[01:39:16.800 --> 01:39:19.400]   He's too honest, folks.
[01:39:19.400 --> 01:39:24.000]   So, so, you know, if I, so listeners, if I ever like just randomly ask on Twitter, if
[01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:29.200]   someone's willing to co-spent a car loan, again, honest as the day of your money is as good
[01:39:29.200 --> 01:39:30.200]   as well.
[01:39:30.200 --> 01:39:31.200]   Back in baby.
[01:39:31.200 --> 01:39:32.200]   He's.
[01:39:32.200 --> 01:39:35.640]   I will tell you exactly how I intend to not be able to pay that back.
[01:39:35.640 --> 01:39:41.360]   Anyway, but if there's, there's a interesting app called Hazel that I discovered recently,
[01:39:41.360 --> 01:39:43.480]   it's an automatic file manager sort of thing.
[01:39:43.480 --> 01:39:47.800]   Like I imagine like the, the, the rules that you have on your email where, hey, if you
[01:39:47.800 --> 01:39:55.560]   ever, if ever an email, a message arrives from a, a, a, a twit.com and it's the sender is
[01:39:55.560 --> 01:39:57.560]   Leo Laport pin that to the very, very top.
[01:39:57.560 --> 01:39:59.760]   So I don't miss it or send it over to this.
[01:39:59.760 --> 01:40:02.400]   So I get a text message.
[01:40:02.400 --> 01:40:08.520]   What Hazel does is it does the exact sort of same thing for like a watched folder.
[01:40:08.520 --> 01:40:12.560]   So that if you create a folder that you can create a folder that attached rules to it
[01:40:12.560 --> 01:40:15.520]   to any time of a file lands in this folder.
[01:40:15.520 --> 01:40:17.000]   Here's what I want you to do with it.
[01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:21.280]   If the file name contains curly quotes, change it to straight quotes.
[01:40:21.280 --> 01:40:28.240]   If I, if it is a JPEG that is smaller than 100 kilobytes, 100 kilobytes, put it in this
[01:40:28.240 --> 01:40:32.240]   folder called social media downloads, image downloads.
[01:40:32.240 --> 01:40:38.840]   If it's more than a megabyte, put it into like photos from family and friends or whatever,
[01:40:38.840 --> 01:40:42.640]   on and on and on and on, all kinds of conditions you can put on to actions that should happen
[01:40:42.640 --> 01:40:48.360]   whenever, whenever it realizes that a full, that a file has been added to this specific,
[01:40:48.360 --> 01:40:50.000]   specific folder.
[01:40:50.000 --> 01:40:56.320]   And it can be pretty, it can be things, things as simple as again, if it's a raw file, raw
[01:40:56.320 --> 01:41:01.280]   video file, send it to this server that I've got or uploaded to this place right here,
[01:41:01.280 --> 01:41:06.680]   or it can be as complicated as including, oh, run this Apple script and then proceed from
[01:41:06.680 --> 01:41:08.880]   this logic that happens right there.
[01:41:08.880 --> 01:41:13.160]   As a matter of fact, people who are into scripting languages will recognize that this is something
[01:41:13.160 --> 01:41:14.160]   you can do.
[01:41:14.160 --> 01:41:20.160]   You can, you can attach a script to a watched folder, but this is not for people who understand
[01:41:20.160 --> 01:41:25.240]   scripting or want something that complicated really is something as simple as, okay, everybody
[01:41:25.240 --> 01:41:29.440]   in this family, here is a folder that just whenever you've got like a note or something
[01:41:29.440 --> 01:41:33.480]   that needs to be backed up, just copy it here, and then automatically it will be put on to
[01:41:33.480 --> 01:41:38.320]   like our family media server and a copy of the picture will be sent to grandma and you
[01:41:38.320 --> 01:41:40.920]   don't have to do anything but just make sure this gets copied into this folder.
[01:41:40.920 --> 01:41:45.040]   I've only been using it for a couple of days, but it's actually, but I've been kind of enjoying
[01:41:45.040 --> 01:41:46.040]   it.
[01:41:46.040 --> 01:41:47.960]   I think I've just scratched the surface of what it can do.
[01:41:47.960 --> 01:41:52.640]   I have not found yet something that I absolutely need a watched folder on my desktop for just
[01:41:52.640 --> 01:41:56.320]   now, but it just, it seems like the sort of app that I will have on my hard drive and
[01:41:56.320 --> 01:42:01.360]   then at some point, as I'm doing like just that num sort of muscle memory thing I do
[01:42:01.360 --> 01:42:08.280]   every like Thursday at 4.22 PM when I realized that I can't see the backdrop on my wallpaper
[01:42:08.280 --> 01:42:12.120]   because I've got so many files in the desktop that I've simply dragged from here to there
[01:42:12.120 --> 01:42:15.480]   and now it's time for me to manually put them where they need to go or process them.
[01:42:15.480 --> 01:42:16.800]   I feel as though, oh, that's right.
[01:42:16.800 --> 01:42:18.080]   I do have that wonderful hazel app.
[01:42:18.080 --> 01:42:20.360]   I should, I should create a hazel action for this.
[01:42:20.360 --> 01:42:25.520]   Yeah, this is, it's interesting because you probably could do all of this yourself with
[01:42:25.520 --> 01:42:31.880]   folder actions, automator and Apple script, but it's so much easier just to use hazel.
[01:42:31.880 --> 01:42:37.080]   So I actually talked about it on my folder actions, hands on Macintosh episode because
[01:42:37.080 --> 01:42:41.240]   I thought it was a good way for people to get into starting to get the idea into the
[01:42:41.240 --> 01:42:43.000]   idea of watch folders.
[01:42:43.000 --> 01:42:47.160]   And then if you need more capability, there's so much built into the Mac.
[01:42:47.160 --> 01:42:52.240]   This is an ancient Mac OS capability that lives on.
[01:42:52.240 --> 01:42:56.560]   And it's one of the many reasons I prefer Mac OS to any other operating system.
[01:42:56.560 --> 01:43:01.240]   There's no analog, analogous behavior elsewhere.
[01:43:01.240 --> 01:43:02.240]   I just really like it.
[01:43:02.240 --> 01:43:06.480]   No, it's a very Mac app.
[01:43:06.480 --> 01:43:07.760]   It looks like a Mac app.
[01:43:07.760 --> 01:43:08.920]   It feels like a Mac app.
[01:43:08.920 --> 01:43:14.440]   Well, it's a one native which we love and it is a big, super compatible.
[01:43:14.440 --> 01:43:15.840]   So now's the time.
[01:43:15.840 --> 01:43:21.480]   Two dollars for the hazel five and then if you want a family pack for five users, it's
[01:43:21.480 --> 01:43:22.480]   a 65 bucks.
[01:43:22.480 --> 01:43:26.560]   And if you're in a free two week trial, of course, that's why I'm still in the trial.
[01:43:26.560 --> 01:43:28.960]   Try before you buy always.
[01:43:28.960 --> 01:43:32.240]   Renee Richie, pick of the week.
[01:43:32.240 --> 01:43:40.240]   So this is just for fun because the chaps that come with the AirPods Macs, they've been
[01:43:40.240 --> 01:43:46.320]   ludicrously incredibly dunked on over the last few weeks just in every way imaginable
[01:43:46.320 --> 01:43:47.600]   because they really are.
[01:43:47.600 --> 01:43:50.280]   They are buttless chaps in every sense of the word.
[01:43:50.280 --> 01:43:52.000]   And I just pretend they don't exist.
[01:43:52.000 --> 01:43:53.920]   They're like the Star Wars sequels or prequels to me.
[01:43:53.920 --> 01:43:58.200]   It's like in my universe there isn't any because I don't use cases for headphones.
[01:43:58.200 --> 01:44:04.360]   I have tons of AKG and Beats and Sennheiser and Bose and I've never used the cases for
[01:44:04.360 --> 01:44:09.120]   them because I either wear them or I take them off and put them on a headstand thing.
[01:44:09.120 --> 01:44:10.480]   But I understand some people do.
[01:44:10.480 --> 01:44:14.440]   So especially when they want to travel and pack the headphones, they want them to be
[01:44:14.440 --> 01:44:15.440]   protected.
[01:44:15.440 --> 01:44:23.600]   So SFBags has got the first announcement out the gate, the hottest of AirPods accessories,
[01:44:23.600 --> 01:44:26.160]   which is a case that you can put the entire AirPod.
[01:44:26.160 --> 01:44:29.800]   You can roast the whole thing inside the case if you want to travel with it, if you want
[01:44:29.800 --> 01:44:30.800]   to protect them.
[01:44:30.800 --> 01:44:31.800]   You need a hard case.
[01:44:31.800 --> 01:44:32.800]   So it's still a-
[01:44:32.800 --> 01:44:34.120]   You need a hard case for these.
[01:44:34.120 --> 01:44:35.560]   I don't know why they've been shipped.
[01:44:35.560 --> 01:44:37.480]   Yeah, I mean, if you're a case person for your-
[01:44:37.480 --> 01:44:38.480]   It's a hard case.
[01:44:38.480 --> 01:44:39.480]   I just leave mine-
[01:44:39.480 --> 01:44:40.480]   Yeah, but if you took it on your own-
[01:44:40.480 --> 01:44:41.480]   But if you took it on your own-
[01:44:41.480 --> 01:44:43.200]   I plan you'd want a case, wouldn't you?
[01:44:43.200 --> 01:44:44.200]   550 bucks.
[01:44:44.200 --> 01:44:48.040]   I just put it around my neck and then it would do a carotid artery choke on me and I'd fall
[01:44:48.040 --> 01:44:49.960]   on contact since it really well.
[01:44:49.960 --> 01:44:50.960]   This is a good company though.
[01:44:50.960 --> 01:44:52.440]   I have a lot of their stuff.
[01:44:52.440 --> 01:44:53.520]   They make good stuff.
[01:44:53.520 --> 01:44:54.520]   Yeah.
[01:44:54.520 --> 01:44:58.720]   And it'll probably come before your AirPod max if you haven't ordered yet.
[01:44:58.720 --> 01:45:01.720]   Just put it on your desk and look at it longingly.
[01:45:01.720 --> 01:45:03.280]   Oh, I've got the case.
[01:45:03.280 --> 01:45:04.280]   That's-
[01:45:04.280 --> 01:45:07.600]   And that's the nice thing about the Apple- like the Apple ecosystem is a cliche, but because
[01:45:07.600 --> 01:45:11.920]   they'd make so few products with so few form factors, companies are willing to invest
[01:45:11.920 --> 01:45:13.640]   in a lot of third party things for them.
[01:45:13.640 --> 01:45:14.640]   Yes.
[01:45:14.640 --> 01:45:16.280]   But they might not if there was 18 different versions of everything.
[01:45:16.280 --> 01:45:17.840]   Yeah, I mean, these are really nice.
[01:45:17.840 --> 01:45:18.840]   So at least you'll have-
[01:45:18.840 --> 01:45:19.840]   Yeah.
[01:45:19.840 --> 01:45:20.840]   Yeah.
[01:45:20.840 --> 01:45:21.840]   Yeah.
[01:45:21.840 --> 01:45:22.840]   But there's no- they know there's going to be a market.
[01:45:22.840 --> 01:45:25.800]   There's somebody who's dumb enough to pay 550 bucks for the AirPods.
[01:45:25.800 --> 01:45:26.800]   I think we got to-
[01:45:26.800 --> 01:45:27.800]   We can get them on a night-
[01:45:27.800 --> 01:45:28.800]   Don't we got them on a carotid?
[01:45:28.800 --> 01:45:29.800]   They can't put on a bus for our case.
[01:45:29.800 --> 01:45:31.400]   Actually, I don't know how much the carotid.
[01:45:31.400 --> 01:45:32.960]   You like your AirPod max so much.
[01:45:32.960 --> 01:45:36.240]   I'm getting kind of- you're kind of swaying me, Renee.
[01:45:36.240 --> 01:45:37.240]   Watch out.
[01:45:37.240 --> 01:45:39.480]   You're perfect for someone like me because I'm not like-
[01:45:39.480 --> 01:45:40.480]   An audio fan.
[01:45:40.480 --> 01:45:44.200]   I'm not that sensitive to audio, but I don't- like I used to listen to Mac Break Weekly
[01:45:44.200 --> 01:45:45.800]   on the speaker from my trio phone.
[01:45:45.800 --> 01:45:46.800]   Yeah.
[01:45:46.800 --> 01:45:47.800]   Again, that was flying for me.
[01:45:47.800 --> 01:45:49.720]   Like an animal, like a monster.
[01:45:49.720 --> 01:45:52.800]   But this- I hear things I've never heard before and mute, like the same thing.
[01:45:52.800 --> 01:45:54.600]   And I know I've heard them before on other really good headphones.
[01:45:54.600 --> 01:45:57.080]   I've just forgotten because it's been so long.
[01:45:57.080 --> 01:46:02.360]   But what- but this is streaming off Apple Music or often Apple TV or Disney Plus Feed.
[01:46:02.360 --> 01:46:06.560]   Like listening to the Mandalorian or some of the other, like some of the Marvel stuff
[01:46:06.560 --> 01:46:11.960]   or some of the Apple TV Plus stuff is ridiculously good with all that atmos data that they can
[01:46:11.960 --> 01:46:12.960]   work with.
[01:46:12.960 --> 01:46:13.960]   It's amazing.
[01:46:13.960 --> 01:46:15.520]   So if you are all in, they're a really good experience.
[01:46:15.520 --> 01:46:19.240]   I think it might be the right product for the time because you know, you're going to
[01:46:19.240 --> 01:46:22.600]   be spending a few more months at home.
[01:46:22.600 --> 01:46:25.360]   It might be nice to have a nice pair of headphones, right?
[01:46:25.360 --> 01:46:27.200]   You owe it to yourself.
[01:46:27.200 --> 01:46:32.080]   To tune out the family members that you're really growing a little bit better.
[01:46:32.080 --> 01:46:33.080]   Yes.
[01:46:33.080 --> 01:46:34.080]   But you can't say anything about it.
[01:46:34.080 --> 01:46:35.080]   Exactly.
[01:46:35.080 --> 01:46:36.080]   Exactly.
[01:46:36.080 --> 01:46:40.640]   And I'm actually wearing something that I ordered a year ago.
[01:46:40.640 --> 01:46:48.200]   But in 2015 we had a very nice bunch of Austrians on the show, the new screen savers from a
[01:46:48.200 --> 01:46:51.800]   company called Mikeme, M-I-K-M-E.
[01:46:51.800 --> 01:46:58.520]   They were former AKG or maybe it was audio, technical engineers who really cared about
[01:46:58.520 --> 01:46:59.800]   microphones.
[01:46:59.800 --> 01:47:05.600]   And they made a really, I thought interesting microphone design for the iPhone.
[01:47:05.600 --> 01:47:07.200]   It's a wireless microphone.
[01:47:07.200 --> 01:47:14.080]   They announced this last year, the Mikeme Pocket, which is, if you look at it, it just,
[01:47:14.080 --> 01:47:19.160]   it looks like a, you know, a lavalier mic that you put on your lapel and something you put
[01:47:19.160 --> 01:47:20.160]   on your belt.
[01:47:20.160 --> 01:47:23.360]   Anybody who's ever worked in a studio has used these for years.
[01:47:23.360 --> 01:47:24.560]   But here's the difference.
[01:47:24.560 --> 01:47:28.840]   It pairs via Bluetooth to your iPhone.
[01:47:28.840 --> 01:47:33.920]   And then you can start the video and, you know, move around, walk around.
[01:47:33.920 --> 01:47:36.280]   You can have a camera operator take the video.
[01:47:36.280 --> 01:47:39.320]   You can put your iPhone on a tripod.
[01:47:39.320 --> 01:47:43.640]   And the audio will stay close to you because you've got a microphone on your lapel.
[01:47:43.640 --> 01:47:48.520]   The problem, of course, with wireless, true wireless microphones, and we have used wireless
[01:47:48.520 --> 01:47:52.320]   labs here in the studio is in order to get something that's not going to get interference
[01:47:52.320 --> 01:47:57.640]   from the local Air Force base, you've got to spend a few thousand bucks, really, right?
[01:47:57.640 --> 01:48:05.320]   John, to get a decent pair of wireless, uh, labs, um, for 350 bucks, you get these.
[01:48:05.320 --> 01:48:07.240]   Now, they don't work the same way.
[01:48:07.240 --> 01:48:08.960]   This is not RF.
[01:48:08.960 --> 01:48:14.560]   What happens is the Bluetooth pairs to the phone and as your recording sends the audio
[01:48:14.560 --> 01:48:18.360]   to the phone, can't keep up because Bluetooth isn't fast enough.
[01:48:18.360 --> 01:48:25.600]   But over time, it will send the video as, as you continue to record and then maybe a
[01:48:25.600 --> 01:48:30.720]   minute or two after your recordings done, it will finish up and then it syncs up with
[01:48:30.720 --> 01:48:33.520]   the video and you've got perfect audio.
[01:48:33.520 --> 01:48:34.920]   It also has built-in memory.
[01:48:34.920 --> 01:48:38.980]   So if you lose this track of your phone, it will continue to record locally and then
[01:48:38.980 --> 01:48:41.800]   send it when you get close enough.
[01:48:41.800 --> 01:48:43.760]   The audio quality is excellent.
[01:48:43.760 --> 01:48:49.320]   And I think for people who, like me, perhaps are, you know, solo operators out in the field,
[01:48:49.320 --> 01:48:53.240]   this would be a really good way to do your videos or anything like that.
[01:48:53.240 --> 01:48:57.200]   Now I ordered this a more than a year ago saying, oh, this will be great.
[01:48:57.200 --> 01:49:02.760]   We're going to, we can use the iPhone to shoot CES 2020 last year.
[01:49:02.760 --> 01:49:04.480]   The old CES.
[01:49:04.480 --> 01:49:08.240]   I just got it a couple of days ago.
[01:49:08.240 --> 01:49:13.680]   So I don't know if that's COVID or a developed, a long development cycle or maybe they just
[01:49:13.680 --> 01:49:15.400]   forgot about me.
[01:49:15.400 --> 01:49:19.680]   Um, it was a, it was a crowd source funding, crowd funding thing.
[01:49:19.680 --> 01:49:24.120]   So I didn't expect it anyway, you know, how I'm being Kickstarter.
[01:49:24.120 --> 01:49:27.440]   But I am very impressed by the concept.
[01:49:27.440 --> 01:49:31.560]   There is one negative, which is in order to get the syncing to work, you have to use their
[01:49:31.560 --> 01:49:33.800]   Mike Me video app.
[01:49:33.800 --> 01:49:36.920]   You actually shoot the video in their app, but it takes advantage of all the iPhone's
[01:49:36.920 --> 01:49:37.920]   features.
[01:49:37.920 --> 01:49:41.800]   I'm, I presuming I was able to shoot 4K 60 frame video and all that.
[01:49:41.800 --> 01:49:47.120]   I don't know if it's Dolby Vision HDR 10, but I don't see why not.
[01:49:47.120 --> 01:49:50.840]   I think it's a, it's a good way to do, you know, and most of the time you don't want
[01:49:50.840 --> 01:49:57.480]   to shoot that super high quality unless your market is Brownly for your YouTube video or
[01:49:57.480 --> 01:49:59.320]   the kinds of videos I do.
[01:49:59.320 --> 01:50:02.640]   It's adequate to do 1080p for me for sure.
[01:50:02.640 --> 01:50:10.040]   Uh, 369 euros for the, the lav and the pocket, they do offer a more professional version
[01:50:10.040 --> 01:50:12.920]   of the law for 150 bucks additional.
[01:50:12.920 --> 01:50:15.480]   But this is a standard mini XLR jack.
[01:50:15.480 --> 01:50:21.520]   So it'll use, you can use, if you have it existing mini XLR, a lavalier microphone, which we
[01:50:21.520 --> 01:50:24.000]   have plenty of, you can always use that as well.
[01:50:24.000 --> 01:50:25.800]   You don't have to use their special mic.
[01:50:25.800 --> 01:50:28.520]   It's the base unit that's unique.
[01:50:28.520 --> 01:50:32.520]   And I ended up getting, I think I bought the Pro bundle, which included a lot of clips
[01:50:32.520 --> 01:50:36.560]   and all sorts of stuff and that was 500 euros at the time it was less than that because
[01:50:36.560 --> 01:50:39.640]   I crowd sourced it and they said you're going to get it a year later than everybody
[01:50:39.640 --> 01:50:40.640]   else.
[01:50:40.640 --> 01:50:43.680]   Anyway, it came Mike Me and they're nice guys in Austria.
[01:50:43.680 --> 01:50:45.360]   So I wanted to give them a little plug.
[01:50:45.360 --> 01:50:49.760]   My K M E dot com.
[01:50:49.760 --> 01:50:55.680]   If you're looking for a way to do wireless audio for your iPhone videos without breaking
[01:50:55.680 --> 01:51:00.560]   the bank, I know 500 bucks sounds like a lot of money, but honestly it's, it's a deal
[01:51:00.560 --> 01:51:01.560]   for wireless love.
[01:51:01.560 --> 01:51:06.840]   Hey guys, I'm so glad I could spend the last show of 20, 20 with you.
[01:51:06.840 --> 01:51:07.840]   Hey, yeah.
[01:51:07.840 --> 01:51:16.600]   And I appreciate the time you've spent with us over the past few years.
[01:51:16.600 --> 01:51:23.080]   This show really lives and dies by your contributions and they're always stellar and stunning.
[01:51:23.080 --> 01:51:25.520]   So I really appreciate your being here.
[01:51:25.520 --> 01:51:30.640]   And I'm glad you had a decent holiday and I hope you have a continued to have a good
[01:51:30.640 --> 01:51:36.120]   little time with the New Year's Eve and New Year's and we'll be back here next Tuesday
[01:51:36.120 --> 01:51:44.560]   and begin 2021 and fine style every Tuesday 11 AM Pacific 2 PM Eastern time.
[01:51:44.560 --> 01:51:46.200]   That's 2100.
[01:51:46.200 --> 01:51:51.000]   No, no, it's 1800 UTC.
[01:51:51.000 --> 01:51:55.560]   WGBH Boston, Esther Andy Naco next week on Thursday.
[01:51:55.560 --> 01:51:56.560]   Yes.
[01:51:56.560 --> 01:52:01.120]   Thank you for the, your, the, the, the, the Twitter super insulated hoodie is still holding
[01:52:01.120 --> 01:52:02.120]   up very.
[01:52:02.120 --> 01:52:03.120]   Yes.
[01:52:03.120 --> 01:52:07.080]   It's still my, still my, it's saving me a lot of money because it allows me to like keep
[01:52:07.080 --> 01:52:09.880]   the, keep the thermostat and like 60.
[01:52:09.880 --> 01:52:13.040]   That's better than it still be in cushy comfort better than a tattoo.
[01:52:13.040 --> 01:52:16.800]   Just put that on your sleeve.
[01:52:16.800 --> 01:52:21.920]   And then thank you so much Renee Renee Richie is at youtube.com/ReneeRitchie.
[01:52:21.920 --> 01:52:26.600]   Hope you feel well and have a wonderful New Year's Eve and New Year's Day and we'll see
[01:52:26.600 --> 01:52:29.880]   you next week on Mac Break Weekly.
[01:52:29.880 --> 01:52:30.880]   You too Leo.
[01:52:30.880 --> 01:52:35.420]   I'm gonna make, make, make, make, send us a hundred pounds of cheese.
[01:52:35.420 --> 01:52:38.720]   Oh, they block a cheese.
[01:52:38.720 --> 01:52:39.720]   They block cheese.
[01:52:39.720 --> 01:52:41.280]   No variety of blocks.
[01:52:41.280 --> 01:52:47.280]   He, it, make lives in a, in Ohio in a Southern Ohio where cheese is a plenty.
[01:52:47.280 --> 01:52:51.940]   He sent us some summer sausage and some cheese and we've divvied it.
[01:52:51.940 --> 01:52:55.520]   Nick, we've divvied it out among all of the staff.
[01:52:55.520 --> 01:52:57.560]   So thank you very much.
[01:52:57.560 --> 01:53:01.920]   Because as, as everyone knows, is a real tradition of melted cheese on New Year's Eve.
[01:53:01.920 --> 01:53:07.480]   You know, at every culture you, you grew up and you got to melt some cheese.
[01:53:07.480 --> 01:53:08.480]   The smoked kind.
[01:53:08.480 --> 01:53:09.480]   A missed opportunity though.
[01:53:09.480 --> 01:53:11.080]   Your, your, your name actually is Leo.
[01:53:11.080 --> 01:53:14.640]   So you could have Leo's, everyone, everyone in front of the desk.
[01:53:14.640 --> 01:53:16.600]   Leo's giving his big block of cheese speech.
[01:53:16.600 --> 01:53:18.400]   I could do that Leo McGarry.
[01:53:18.400 --> 01:53:19.400]   That's right.
[01:53:19.400 --> 01:53:20.920]   Ready for the big block of cheese.
[01:53:20.920 --> 01:53:21.920]   You're a big block of cheese.
[01:53:21.920 --> 01:53:26.760]   And all we're invited to come to partake of it since then.
[01:53:26.760 --> 01:53:29.240]   One of the best episodes.
[01:53:29.240 --> 01:53:38.640]   And there is a, one of our serious fans, to my knowledge, there are only three Twit tattoos
[01:53:38.640 --> 01:53:39.640]   in existence.
[01:53:39.640 --> 01:53:42.640]   Do you remember whose name this was?
[01:53:42.640 --> 01:53:43.640]   John?
[01:53:43.640 --> 01:53:46.720]   If you, if you're still around and you still have the tattoo, let me know.
[01:53:46.720 --> 01:53:52.760]   There is of course, F and done Jason Klyanthus who has his Twit tattoo on his wrist.
[01:53:52.760 --> 01:53:58.520]   And then that third Twit tattoo, no one will ever know where that third Twit tattoo lies.
[01:53:58.520 --> 01:54:00.520]   Stop pointing at me.
[01:54:00.520 --> 01:54:02.520]   It's a secret.
[01:54:02.520 --> 01:54:03.520]   Well, actually you.
[01:54:03.520 --> 01:54:07.960]   I'll say that Twit tattoo still roams the flatlands today.
[01:54:07.960 --> 01:54:13.000]   You know, it's funny because I always, you know, I say, I hate tattoos and I realize,
[01:54:13.000 --> 01:54:14.800]   oh my God, I have one.
[01:54:14.800 --> 01:54:18.160]   And, but I know it's, it's in a position where the sun don't shine.
[01:54:18.160 --> 01:54:23.080]   And the only person who ever sees is my wife who never fails to comment upon it and saying,
[01:54:23.080 --> 01:54:24.800]   oh, damn Twit tattoo.
[01:54:24.800 --> 01:54:25.800]   Thank you.
[01:54:25.800 --> 01:54:29.000]   You know, Ink Master sometimes does a cover up challenge.
[01:54:29.000 --> 01:54:34.360]   So you get like a flaming skull riding a hot rod.
[01:54:34.360 --> 01:54:35.720]   It would be a ladybug.
[01:54:35.720 --> 01:54:38.280]   They would have to tattoo over it.
[01:54:38.280 --> 01:54:39.920]   Thank you everybody for joining us.
[01:54:39.920 --> 01:54:41.320]   We will see you next week.
[01:54:41.320 --> 01:54:43.240]   But now I'm sure you're not working.
[01:54:43.240 --> 01:54:50.680]   But if you are, break time is over.
[01:54:50.680 --> 01:54:54.080]   It's time to get back to work or something.
[01:54:54.080 --> 01:54:55.080]   You know what?
[01:54:55.080 --> 01:54:57.080]   I have a, I have a resolution for 2021.
[01:54:57.080 --> 01:54:58.080]   I need a new show, close.
[01:54:58.080 --> 01:54:59.080]   Let's go.
[01:54:59.080 --> 01:55:01.080]   Come up with a new way to end the show.
[01:55:01.080 --> 01:55:02.080]   Thanks everybody.
[01:55:02.080 --> 01:55:03.080]   We'll see you next week.
[01:55:03.080 --> 01:55:03.080]   Bye bye.
[01:55:03.080 --> 01:55:10.080]   [MUSIC]
