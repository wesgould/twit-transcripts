[00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:21.040]   Apple news. Alex Lenzi's back from his sojourn abroad. Did you go abroad?
[00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:28.000]   No, I just had productions. We had a... Did you leave that? I did leave the house.
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:33.280]   Oh, okay. Two weeks ago, we had a theater event that I do. And then last week,
[00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:40.960]   we covered the Gen the Gen of AI meetup in San Francisco. Good time for that. That must have
[00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:46.320]   been interesting. Wow. It was really cool. It was like all the thinkers.
[00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.920]   How much of office is right now? Yeah. How much of office hours now is about AI?
[00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:56.080]   It's a growing amount. The questions come up, two or three questions a day related to it.
[00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:02.160]   And I had a presentation this morning about green screen. I made most of the images from
[00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:07.520]   mid-journey. So it kind of just seeing that. It's all in there, maybe. I said, give me a
[00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:15.120]   muppet in front of a green screen shot with a Sony a7, S3, a short field. And we were talking
[00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:19.120]   about it. But I have a whole of these muppets as examples. And they're different muppets.
[00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:21.200]   That's really great. Because mid-journey keeps on putting them up differently.
[00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:25.840]   Yeah. And muppets don't have hands, so that's not a problem. Actually, I love mid-journey. We've
[00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:30.400]   been playing with mid-journey V5, and it's really... Wow. Anyway, we'll get to that. Office hours
[00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:35.840]   dot global, if you're winning what office hours is, is Alex is... Let's see. He's got a day job at
[00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:40.800]   zero-nine-zero dot media. I guess it's his mid-day job. It's like, no, no, it's my morning,
[00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:46.960]   my morning, my morning, my day job. Okay. Well, welcome back, we missed you. Also here,
[00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:53.200]   Mr. Andy Enoco from WJ, they ate you in Boston. Hello, Andrew. Hey, who? You look good.
[00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:59.200]   Thank you. I've brushed my my my cyber incident. You're in fine-fettles.
[00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:06.240]   If you're noticing. Yeah. Or South fine-fettle, I guess. The extra, the extra couple hours of day
[00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:11.360]   light are really, really, really, really, really, pretty loving it. I looked out the window at 7 p.m.
[00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:18.000]   And went, it's still light. What? What? Or in my case, over the weekend, looking at the window,
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:23.840]   at waking up at 4.30 and not knowing whether I'd just fall asleep for only two hours, or whether
[00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:27.840]   I'd actually slept for 14 hours, and I lead this sort of lifestyle where it really could have been
[00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:34.240]   either one. It's fun. Did I miss a whole day, a whole week, a whole month? I don't know. Am I,
[00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:42.160]   am I really well rested right now, or should I go back to bed? And from six colors.com,
[00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:48.960]   the wonderful Jason Snell. Hello, Leo, the port. It's good to hear from you.
[00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:54.560]   So, Michael, Mica Sargent has rubbed off on you. Now you're starting to sing. Does he say? Yeah,
[00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:59.120]   maybe that's it. He might be rubbing off. Mica sings everything. Yes. If you let him.
[00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:03.920]   Yeah. I don't know if that's me rubbing off on him or him rubbing off on me at this point.
[00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:07.360]   Oh, interesting. You're a dangerous combination. We're merging. It's like matter and antimatter.
[00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:12.400]   Yeah. Jason will be hosting the show next week. I'm going on vacation for three weeks,
[00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:16.800]   then Mica for a couple of weeks hosting, and I'll be back on the 25th.
[00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:25.600]   And I hope you have a wonderful time. Have you fallen into the John Gruber hole? Do you know what
[00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:33.360]   I'm talking about? John Gruber. I mean, not lately. It's been a while. I thought the city of Philadelphia
[00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:43.680]   had a tourist trap that his family runs. It's just a barstow. I think probably 2000 word piece
[00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:50.080]   about a new piece of software. It's a group and then encrypted group messaging app called Wave
[00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:56.400]   Length. Long, long piece on it about two thirds of the way. And he said, Oh, and by the way,
[00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:03.840]   I am an advisor and have equity. I have equity. It's like, wait a minute. Hold on there.
[00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:13.360]   It was a very extensive and very, uh, praiseful piece. So I signed up. I mean, what the hell?
[00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:18.080]   Although I'll tell you one thing I got one. First of all, I think it's a great idea.
[00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:23.680]   I don't disagree with him to have a fully encrypted group chat program that's not
[00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:29.200]   owned by Facebook. I think that's a good thing. What's happened so dominant in the world and
[00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:33.840]   yeah, it's and then encrypted, I guess, but it's owned by Facebook. So I guess that's their
[00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:38.240]   competition. The other thing that they're doing, because this is what everybody does now,
[00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:45.040]   is slathering a thin layer of AI over it. You can. For fun, for funsies, just for funsies. And I
[00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:53.200]   don't like that. I just want to say because the AI is in the chat with you and it's and it's
[00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:58.960]   and it's just like for me, it's like ads in Twitter. You have to use a certain amount of cognitive
[00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:07.040]   effort load to say, is this a person or is this an ad or is it a chat or AI or what? And I don't
[00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:12.720]   want to do that. I don't like to do that. I'm some, I think Andy. Yeah, it sounds a lot like
[00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:17.840]   Google wave, especially when you put AIs inside the chat. But hey, if they can revive it, I thought
[00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:22.080]   they, I thought Google killed that way before it was doing it. I don't know. There's AI everywhere.
[00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:28.640]   Now, last week, Google's bard came out, but that's not an Apple story. So we'll save that for this
[00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:34.000]   week in Google or some other show. Who cares? I just was wondering, because I noticed a lot of
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:40.640]   a lot of us, uh, Gruber fans ended up in wavelength. Oh, I noticed you were on there before I, uh,
[00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:45.760]   I was like, Leo's already there. Leo already read it. And this morning, I had a list of friends,
[00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:49.760]   all of whom had signed up while I was sleeping. I'm like, okay, all right, we all read it. Yeah,
[00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:54.320]   we all read it. It's fine. It's cool. The problem with all of these is not that whether it's
[00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:58.480]   functionality or I mean, it's beautiful and it's functional and it's end to end encrypted. It's
[00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:05.760]   Apple only, which is a big problem so far. Uh, and of course adoption. If your friends aren't on it,
[00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:10.960]   doesn't matter if they're all in WhatsApp, which they are in everywhere but US, uh, then it, then
[00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:18.880]   it's, it's, it mocks next. Anyway, let's move on. I'm sure you will be talking more about that or not
[00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:26.480]   as, uh, as the weeks fly by. Oh, the confidence of somebody who's about to go on vacation. I can't wait.
[00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:31.040]   I am just, I am so out of here. Great topic. Good luck with it. Good luck with it. Have fun.
[00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:45.520]   I am so out. 16.4 came out yesterday for iOS and iPad, OS. Um, and oh my goodness. It's all about
[00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:54.240]   the mojis. Lots of new mojis. Uh, yeah, here's where moji crop was a little late, right?
[00:07:54.240 --> 00:08:00.560]   21 21. We've talked about before shaking head, pink, heart, blue, heart, gray, heart, donkey,
[00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:05.520]   moose, not a donkey, moose goose, but three different things. Donky, moose, and goose,
[00:08:05.520 --> 00:08:08.000]   a blackbird, a wing, a jellyfish, a hyacinth.
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:18.880]   Actually, the biggest thing for me and Andy is Apple classical. And I figured that that was tied
[00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:25.920]   somehow to 16.4. And sure enough, shortly after I updated to 16.4, I got a message saying, oh,
[00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:31.200]   hey, classical's available for download. So they made their, their March 28 deadline.
[00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:34.320]   Have you reviewed it? Have you examined it? Andrew?
[00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:40.880]   I spent less night taking a look at it. I'm not sure if it requires, I have a look at the
[00:08:40.880 --> 00:08:46.320]   requirements page. All I know is that I did download the app and run it before I installed
[00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:51.600]   16.4 on my device. Yeah, it may not require it. Yeah. However, however, that might be the reason
[00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:56.480]   why there are a couple of bugs with it when I ran it on the before the update. Now it's
[00:08:56.480 --> 00:09:01.360]   running perfectly fine. And yeah, I've been listening to it like part of last night and into this
[00:09:01.360 --> 00:09:07.920]   morning. It's really nice. It's I don't see it as a revolution necessarily, but it didn't have to
[00:09:07.920 --> 00:09:13.360]   be a revolution. I like I like the fact that just simply the fact that it understands that
[00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:20.400]   as we've said before, with classical music, there are all all of the tags that you have to put into
[00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:27.360]   every single one of these things, all the metadata is so incredibly valuable, because it overwhelms
[00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:32.160]   Apple music and Spotify and any other conventional player, because there are just so many different
[00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:38.800]   things that makes that make a classical track searchable. So and also like the fact that just
[00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:46.080]   again, the other simple thing where I'm used to not being able to know what the hell I'm listening to,
[00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:55.360]   because the name of the track is like Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, open parentheses 1713.
[00:09:55.360 --> 00:10:01.760]   Oh, closed parentheses, abduction from the Saraglio, opus, fum, blah, blah, directed by blah, blah,
[00:10:01.760 --> 00:10:07.280]   blah. And I'm still waiting for what is the name of the area I'm listening to right now. And it's
[00:10:07.280 --> 00:10:11.600]   it's very, very sensibly, like we'll just simply say, here is the name of the piece you're listening
[00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:16.640]   to right now. And then everything else comes in underneath it. But very good. Also, it seems like
[00:10:16.640 --> 00:10:23.600]   it has a nice number of curated playlists and curated options. I don't know if I'm surprised or
[00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:28.320]   not surprised that some with so many of them are introduction to classical music. Here is your
[00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:35.520]   first introduction to this. So if it if it helps a lot of people discover a variety of music that
[00:10:35.520 --> 00:10:41.200]   maybe they hadn't paid much attention to, that's great. It's going to make classical music lovers
[00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:45.840]   less upset than they were before. It's not going to be possible to make them all really, really happy.
[00:10:45.840 --> 00:10:51.200]   But they promised it. They, as you and I have been saying, they bought a service that we liked.
[00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:56.880]   That service has disappeared for two years. Well, it's been rebranded. So let's just hope that Apple
[00:10:56.880 --> 00:11:02.240]   continues to put effort and updating and new thoughts and new content into this. And not just
[00:11:02.240 --> 00:11:07.840]   simply decide two years later that, oh, I guess that was just a hobby after all.
[00:11:07.840 --> 00:11:11.440]   I guess inevitably it's going to the comparison is going to be to Prime Phonic,
[00:11:11.440 --> 00:11:16.400]   the app that they bought, the company that they bought a year and a half ago. You could show it now.
[00:11:16.400 --> 00:11:24.880]   There you go. Thank you. And and took their time getting out, introducing Apple musical
[00:11:25.440 --> 00:11:33.360]   music classical with Alex French. I don't know why there's two F's in French is just a little
[00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:38.160]   two minute track. A couple of things I really liked. There's a lot, you know, it looks very much
[00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:44.480]   like Prime Phonic even down to I was very pleased. These, you know, I really like the Prime Phonic
[00:11:44.480 --> 00:11:50.000]   podcast. They'll have they have these, the story of her classical, which is both music and text
[00:11:50.640 --> 00:11:56.560]   kind of explaining, you know, it's a nine part companion guide to classical music,
[00:11:56.560 --> 00:12:02.080]   which I think is I'll be listening to that on the plane. I'm sure they also have a whole spatial
[00:12:02.080 --> 00:12:07.600]   audio section. Of course, it's Apple, right? Yeah. And I'm that actually put me over the top,
[00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:12.560]   bringing my AirPods Pro Max on the plane because I want to I do want to listen to these,
[00:12:12.560 --> 00:12:18.880]   you know, as if you're in the concert hall would be pretty fun. I presume I didn't I didn't
[00:12:18.880 --> 00:12:24.720]   attempt to figure out if they have everything. But I'm happy. I think this is this is what we wanted,
[00:12:24.720 --> 00:12:30.400]   right? I gave it a few curveballs. The fact matter is that almost anything that that I could
[00:12:30.400 --> 00:12:35.520]   think of is actually probably already covered by Apple music. It's only these really, really random
[00:12:35.520 --> 00:12:41.440]   moments where you're you're reading a blog post about here. Here are the here are the the the
[00:12:41.440 --> 00:12:47.120]   10 best versions of molars simph, sixth symphony symphony. And you're like, Oh, I actually like to
[00:12:47.120 --> 00:12:52.960]   listen to some of these and only like two of them are in Spotify or Apple music. And in and in the
[00:12:52.960 --> 00:12:57.760]   Apple classical, you'll see like four or five. But it's it's a really, really deep catalog. That's
[00:12:57.760 --> 00:13:03.120]   how a lot of people get especially especially with opera. It's not just the composer, it's not just
[00:13:03.120 --> 00:13:07.200]   the conductor. It's like, I want to hear about it to Baldi sing this area. I want to hear Diana
[00:13:07.200 --> 00:13:12.560]   Domra sing this, that I want to hear you know, you want to compare or you want to see you want to
[00:13:12.560 --> 00:13:19.440]   figure out what the best version is, even if it isn't in stereo yet. Yeah. See all the Maria Calus
[00:13:19.440 --> 00:13:27.360]   albums and you get a quite a few classic performances from the 50s through the 70s. So yeah, I think this
[00:13:27.360 --> 00:13:33.120]   is this is a very sad, I haven't tried it on my have a try to my iPad. There was some
[00:13:33.120 --> 00:13:38.880]   grouse in online about not an iPad. I phone only which really is disappointing. You can run it on
[00:13:38.880 --> 00:13:43.120]   the iPad with the majesty of the big black bars on the side of it. That's very disappointing.
[00:13:43.120 --> 00:13:46.320]   Unless you put it in stage bandager, it's just not there. This would be so nice. It doesn't run
[00:13:46.320 --> 00:13:51.760]   on the Mac at all because to run on a Mac and iOS app has to have an iPad view, which it doesn't.
[00:13:51.760 --> 00:13:58.320]   So it's only iPhone and then yeah, in the big compatibility window on the iPad. I have to think
[00:13:58.320 --> 00:14:03.440]   that's something they will do. Although you'd think with a year and a half, they would have
[00:14:03.440 --> 00:14:07.760]   and they could have just taken the prime father co-base. But obviously they did not want to do that.
[00:14:07.760 --> 00:14:14.880]   So they didn't. I wonder whether we'll see an iPad version before we see an Android version.
[00:14:14.880 --> 00:14:20.560]   Like, are they really interested in growing Apple Music and Apple Classical beyond this one
[00:14:20.560 --> 00:14:26.800]   platform? Or are they seeing it as a bonus for loyal subscribers to Apple Music? Who knows?
[00:14:26.800 --> 00:14:33.360]   I'm pleased. I think if you're a classical music fan, you'll be satisfied. And if you're new to
[00:14:33.360 --> 00:14:40.960]   classical, which is fairly important, this is a great resource to get you started, I think.
[00:14:40.960 --> 00:14:45.040]   So a lot of good categorization going on here and things like that.
[00:14:45.040 --> 00:14:49.360]   And let's not forget this isn't a separate service. It is part of Apple Music. So
[00:14:49.360 --> 00:14:52.720]   if you subscribe to Apple Music, you also get Apple Classical. So it's a win-win.
[00:14:52.720 --> 00:14:59.760]   Yeah, I'm very happy. So okay, we'll give a tentative A, not a plus, but a tentative A to
[00:14:59.760 --> 00:15:07.520]   Apple and pending an Android version and an iPad version, which you'd think. So you can't do
[00:15:07.520 --> 00:15:11.120]   catalysts in this. You have those different screen sizes. That makes sense, I guess.
[00:15:11.120 --> 00:15:18.720]   So then we could get it on our Mac if they ever do that as well. Anything else to say about 16.4?
[00:15:18.720 --> 00:15:24.960]   I think the most interesting thing about it if you still make phone calls, which I don't know
[00:15:24.960 --> 00:15:29.440]   if you do. I don't know who does, but they had this tech that they built into like FaceTime
[00:15:29.440 --> 00:15:34.720]   and other things, which was noise canceling. And they're bringing that to regular phone calls.
[00:15:34.720 --> 00:15:39.600]   So it's going to try to do a much more active job of processing your voice and dropping the
[00:15:39.600 --> 00:15:45.920]   background noise out when you're making a regular old phone call on your iPhone, which might be good.
[00:15:45.920 --> 00:15:52.800]   They call it voice isolation. And I always turn it on. I don't know on FaceTime. I don't know if it
[00:15:52.800 --> 00:15:57.600]   does any good, but I always turn it on. And you know what? Again, I'll probably be trying this as I
[00:15:57.600 --> 00:16:04.080]   call people from airports and, you know, the Sagrada Familia and that kind of thing.
[00:16:04.080 --> 00:16:10.720]   I'll be making lots of phone calls from all over Europe. Duplicates in photos, the Duplicates
[00:16:10.720 --> 00:16:17.200]   album and photos expand support that detect duplicate photos in an iCloud shared photo library.
[00:16:17.200 --> 00:16:22.560]   That's actually where you really need it because I'm sharing my photos of you, Jason. Now with you,
[00:16:22.560 --> 00:16:27.760]   many, maybe duplicates. So I think it's good that they're doing that. You still, I presume,
[00:16:27.760 --> 00:16:32.160]   have to do a manual merge, but at least you could find them. Andy, I'm sorry.
[00:16:32.160 --> 00:16:39.200]   Oh, no, no. I was good. I mentioned that I was looking at the Apple security update at the
[00:16:39.200 --> 00:16:44.960]   Apple support page about the security content of 60.4 and seeing boy, it's a long, long list of
[00:16:44.960 --> 00:16:50.320]   things that they fix, including a lot of the phrase able to execute arbitrary code with kernel
[00:16:50.320 --> 00:16:55.920]   privileges pops up a few times. That may be able to break out of its sandbox,
[00:16:55.920 --> 00:17:00.960]   gain access to protected parts of the file system. So yeah, this is a lot of,
[00:17:00.960 --> 00:17:07.360]   hopefully a lot of things that have not been exploited just yet to merit a tap on the shoulder
[00:17:07.360 --> 00:17:14.480]   from Project Zero. Yeah. Hey, the good news is they're constantly patching things, right?
[00:17:14.480 --> 00:17:22.400]   Of course. The bad news is there's some of these are pretty severe. Zero click in the wild,
[00:17:22.400 --> 00:17:30.560]   zero days is not good. Oh, retry code with kernel privileges. That's, that's, that's,
[00:17:30.560 --> 00:17:37.520]   that's bad. There is a voiceover support for maps in the weather app. Okay.
[00:17:37.520 --> 00:17:42.640]   It's a couple of accessibility features. Access using the web, are people using the weather app?
[00:17:43.440 --> 00:17:50.960]   I moved completely to carrot. I'm going to. Yeah. Regular people are. I bet you 90% of iPhone
[00:17:50.960 --> 00:17:55.600]   users don't even that you got weather. What do you need? Carrots a lot better. How much
[00:17:55.600 --> 00:18:01.520]   weather do you need? Right. But if you're listening carrots, carrots, a lot better. I,
[00:18:01.520 --> 00:18:05.200]   when dark, when I had dark sky, I was so embedded in dark sky that I didn't really think about it.
[00:18:05.200 --> 00:18:10.880]   And so I had, I had bought care or whatever, downloaded care a long time ago. And,
[00:18:12.080 --> 00:18:15.120]   and it's especially with all the weather, the rain and everything else right now. It's
[00:18:15.120 --> 00:18:19.120]   particularly funny if you turn the attitude all the way up. There's a great work, but.
[00:18:19.120 --> 00:18:24.320]   I know carrot is so snarky. Yes. And I just like the notifications because, you know,
[00:18:24.320 --> 00:18:29.440]   every time it drizzles here, which lately has been often, it will say horrible profan, I turn
[00:18:29.440 --> 00:18:35.040]   it all away, of course, horrible profane things. You can also choose your political party. You
[00:18:35.040 --> 00:18:41.040]   know, like are you left, right, progressive communist? There's communist is my choice. And so you can
[00:18:41.040 --> 00:18:44.640]   get a little, a little political thought in there too, which is a lot of fun.
[00:18:44.640 --> 00:18:53.280]   Here is a very nice piece by Shrinney Karamadi from nothing. No, I'm sorry, Nightingale,
[00:18:53.280 --> 00:18:59.280]   dvs.com, which I don't, I've never heard of, but it's a data visualization site. A eulogy for
[00:18:59.280 --> 00:19:05.600]   dark sky, a data visualization masterpiece. And in this, Shrinney compares, you know,
[00:19:05.600 --> 00:19:11.920]   weather and dark sky. Oh, this is sad. The dead dark sky interface. It's zero degrees everywhere.
[00:19:11.920 --> 00:19:20.000]   But I agree dark sky was kind of brilliant. We've talked before about the difference between
[00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:25.920]   dark sky and the kinds of forecasts you get from the, you know, national weather bureau.
[00:19:25.920 --> 00:19:29.680]   You know, and other little things like easily being able to change the city would is
[00:19:29.680 --> 00:19:32.320]   something that dark sky I don't care about. Yeah.
[00:19:32.320 --> 00:19:36.160]   Yeah. But I still, every time I open up weather, I'm like, what's that?
[00:19:36.160 --> 00:19:39.440]   It's there. We talked about it. It's there. You could find it, but you're right.
[00:19:39.440 --> 00:19:42.000]   It's not a. It's just, it's surprising that dark sky. You're used to dark sky.
[00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:46.000]   Yeah. But then I went over to carrot and immediately found it. It's just like where the
[00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:50.000]   city name is. It'd be really good if I just tap on changing your name. I know that sounds crazy,
[00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:56.800]   but yeah, I will say that I, I, I become a little bit of a curmudgeon about Apple's aggressiveness
[00:19:56.800 --> 00:20:02.320]   related to interface recently. And like I, Ventura has been just a disaster in my opinion.
[00:20:02.320 --> 00:20:06.400]   Really? Yeah. I just hate it. I hate the, if I had,
[00:20:06.400 --> 00:20:08.800]   settings drives me nuts still every time I open it.
[00:20:08.800 --> 00:20:14.080]   Settings drive me like when I'm talking about screensaver, I would like all the,
[00:20:14.080 --> 00:20:19.840]   all the settings for screensaver to be in the same place. Not like my lock screen is now
[00:20:19.840 --> 00:20:23.600]   somewhere else. And I can't, this morning I was looking on an update and I was like,
[00:20:24.160 --> 00:20:28.080]   it wasn't straight. You know, it just, all these things, nothing about it is natural and nothing
[00:20:28.080 --> 00:20:32.720]   is connected. Like we're, you're in a certain zone. I don't care if you copy it to another place,
[00:20:32.720 --> 00:20:36.000]   but when I'm talking about this thing, I should be able to do all the things with that thing
[00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:41.040]   in one place. And I think that I just hope that, I mean, there's rumors that the next operating
[00:20:41.040 --> 00:20:44.080]   systems are all going to be clean up and I hope Apple just doesn't change anything.
[00:20:44.080 --> 00:20:46.640]   Like I'm just like, just, just add a couple of things and call it a day.
[00:20:46.640 --> 00:20:49.040]   I mean, they need to change the settings app is what they need to do.
[00:20:49.040 --> 00:20:51.200]   They need to go back. Don't, don't just leave that the same.
[00:20:51.200 --> 00:20:56.640]   Fix that. Fix that fast. I wrote, I don't know how many, I wrote thousands of words about how
[00:20:56.640 --> 00:21:00.960]   all the ways that settings app is bad last summer. And you know, they didn't change anything.
[00:21:00.960 --> 00:21:04.000]   When it was in beta, they could have, they could have looked, search for it.
[00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:06.400]   Yeah, they were listening and then ignoring.
[00:21:06.400 --> 00:21:09.840]   I waited, you know, like it was one of the things I waited, I waited, the reason I'm
[00:21:09.840 --> 00:21:12.800]   complaining about now and you're wondering, why didn't you complain about it earlier is because
[00:21:12.800 --> 00:21:16.800]   after up the last update, I was like, I'm going to wait six months. And so I waited six months.
[00:21:16.800 --> 00:21:21.040]   And so only a couple of weeks ago, have I installed a Ventura. And now I wish I
[00:21:21.040 --> 00:21:26.080]   hadn't. So, so I'm now going to buy new thing will be is the next operating system.
[00:21:26.080 --> 00:21:28.720]   Unless there's something really good, I'm just going to wait until the following
[00:21:28.720 --> 00:21:32.480]   WWDC, let this work this stuff out and hopefully it's better. But I, they're not,
[00:21:32.480 --> 00:21:35.200]   I think they're missing the mark. I think that there, and it's not like,
[00:21:35.200 --> 00:21:39.600]   there's some stability issues. I think they're moving too fast for their developers.
[00:21:39.600 --> 00:21:44.080]   So there, there, there's a lot of stability issues across a lot of different apps. And it's
[00:21:44.080 --> 00:21:49.040]   just because Apple's changing so many things so quickly to try to get this, to, I think,
[00:21:49.040 --> 00:21:53.280]   to sync things up with the iPad. And I think that we're just, there's all these things that are
[00:21:53.280 --> 00:21:58.160]   happening all at one time. And it's just really, it's, it, nothing is quite as, I just think that
[00:21:58.160 --> 00:22:02.800]   Apple needs to rest. That's all. Just seven days.
[00:22:02.800 --> 00:22:08.000]   And nap. Just take a nap. Take a nap for a year. It'd be great. Just fix the thing that need to be
[00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:13.680]   fixed. And you know, like, just, you know, happy, you're cranky and tired. You need to go to bed now.
[00:22:13.680 --> 00:22:15.120]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:22:17.600 --> 00:22:22.800]   Yeah. I still find myself having to use spot. I will open, I will open up settings, but I'll still
[00:22:22.800 --> 00:22:26.320]   have to use spotlight to find the thing I'm actually looking for. And I didn't have to do that before.
[00:22:26.320 --> 00:22:31.760]   Although, although Apple, Apple sometimes does change its mind when the, when the breakthrough
[00:22:31.760 --> 00:22:37.920]   features of 16.4 is that in I book, in the, in the, in the books app, now you get back that super,
[00:22:37.920 --> 00:22:42.720]   super early page animation anymore. No, no longer is boring as a Kindle.
[00:22:42.720 --> 00:22:46.160]   So the kids, so the kids can remember people complain about page turning.
[00:22:46.160 --> 00:22:50.800]   Guess what they said? You know what? We can give you back your page turning. Congratulations.
[00:22:50.800 --> 00:22:54.000]   You're welcome. It's historical lesson for the kids.
[00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:59.040]   Yeah. Let me, let me just show you. Let's see. I see what books I have on my,
[00:22:59.040 --> 00:23:04.160]   of the 800 things you complain about, we decided that this is the least monotromal.
[00:23:04.160 --> 00:23:09.280]   Yeah. Yeah. Here's a quarter kid.
[00:23:09.280 --> 00:23:14.240]   There's a, let's open common list recipes, because I know you're all can't wait. Oh, you know,
[00:23:14.240 --> 00:23:19.920]   you probably want, you probably want to do a doing math with Python. There's a, there's a better book.
[00:23:19.920 --> 00:23:24.400]   But let me just install one of these here real quick, because I guess I don't have any books on
[00:23:24.400 --> 00:23:28.960]   my, I don't read books on the iPhone. Oh, wait a minute. Here's one. Oh, no, it's in the cloud too.
[00:23:28.960 --> 00:23:35.120]   Darn it. They're all up there in the puffiness. I want to show you the page turning. So the,
[00:23:35.120 --> 00:23:39.760]   so the, so the, why did, so that raises the question. Why did they change it? And why,
[00:23:39.760 --> 00:23:45.040]   and did they bring it back because we complained? Is that what happened? I think that kind of thing
[00:23:45.040 --> 00:23:49.680]   feels like an executive said, there's an executive somewhere at Apple that was using that really
[00:23:49.680 --> 00:23:53.520]   liked the page turn and something happened because I just don't, I just don't, I think it's the
[00:23:53.520 --> 00:23:57.040]   opposite. I think that there was some executive at Apple who was like, Oh, that page turn is dumb.
[00:23:57.040 --> 00:24:00.560]   Take it out. And everybody was like, no, no, people love it. They're like, no, no, no, take it out.
[00:24:00.560 --> 00:24:03.920]   And then everybody complained about it. And they're like, all right. Okay. I guess you were right.
[00:24:03.920 --> 00:24:07.440]   Do you think it was a Johnny, it was like an anti Johnny. I've,
[00:24:08.640 --> 00:24:12.320]   how long has it been? I do more of them. Kick it out there. It was only just at the,
[00:24:12.320 --> 00:24:16.960]   in, in October, September when they shipped it that they pulled it out. So it's a recent removal,
[00:24:16.960 --> 00:24:22.160]   which is like, why now? Why now would you do that thing? And so then they put it back. I like it.
[00:24:22.160 --> 00:24:26.480]   I actually, I really like it when Apple tries to do something and they think that like,
[00:24:26.480 --> 00:24:30.080]   no one will notice and nobody cares. And then everybody screams bloody murder and they're like,
[00:24:30.080 --> 00:24:35.360]   okay, fine. It's like when Steve Jobs was like, you can have a bumper case. It's that kind of
[00:24:35.360 --> 00:24:39.680]   exasperation, but at least it's back. And the truth is we think of Apple as monolithic,
[00:24:39.680 --> 00:24:44.320]   but I always imagine that what's happening is there's a big argument inside Apple and they lose it.
[00:24:44.320 --> 00:24:49.680]   And then, and then the media complains about it and users complain about it. And the people inside
[00:24:49.680 --> 00:24:56.080]   Apple go see and then maybe they get it reversed in the one run. I keep thinking that's what happened
[00:24:56.080 --> 00:25:03.360]   here. Apparently you have to turn it on because I'm getting the old slide. This is, this is the
[00:25:03.360 --> 00:25:08.960]   bad page turn. So as a classic, a classic book would do where you would put your finger on a piece
[00:25:08.960 --> 00:25:16.000]   of paper and slide it away. So how do I, I saw a little pop up that of course was in too much
[00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:20.080]   of a hurry. You know, it's funny. Go to the settings settings section. It's funny how important
[00:25:20.080 --> 00:25:24.960]   those transitions are too, because one of the problems we have with with cat, I do a lot of work
[00:25:24.960 --> 00:25:30.880]   with captions. And one of these with captions that happens is that a lot of the social networks
[00:25:30.880 --> 00:25:36.160]   will just have them just jump, you know, just change. But if you watch it on TV, it rolls, it
[00:25:36.160 --> 00:25:41.200]   rolls, you know, it kind of rolls from one and it, it's much more pleasurable to watch it roll,
[00:25:41.200 --> 00:25:46.080]   watch the captions roll than to watch them jump. It's easier to read them. And it was funny because
[00:25:46.080 --> 00:25:49.440]   it was, I was talking to somebody who really specializes in this and he's like, you know,
[00:25:49.440 --> 00:25:53.200]   government spent a lot of money figuring out the way those captions. It would, it was, it was a lot
[00:25:53.200 --> 00:25:57.280]   easier just to have them keep on appearing and not having them roll. Everyone just stopped
[00:25:57.280 --> 00:26:02.320]   reinventing the wheel. So you go to, so okay, so I finally figured this out. You click the button
[00:26:02.320 --> 00:26:08.960]   in the lower right, you go to themes and settings. And, and there's a little thing that you can have
[00:26:08.960 --> 00:26:14.720]   slide, curl or none. Now maybe none is what the guy with the captions would want, but let's turn,
[00:26:14.720 --> 00:26:19.200]   let's turn a little curl on. Curling on. Wait a minute. Oh, look at that.
[00:26:19.200 --> 00:26:25.520]   Oh, I think I'm team none, but I love that the whimsy of the curl is back.
[00:26:26.320 --> 00:26:30.080]   That was one of the things I love about the, about the books I have to begin with.
[00:26:30.080 --> 00:26:34.560]   That was like the fact that somebody wanted to show off the graphics
[00:26:34.560 --> 00:26:41.120]   primitives, the things that you can get for free. It gets so expensive in terms of code that
[00:26:41.120 --> 00:26:46.880]   that's why they got rid of it or I don't, I don't know that they, if they got rid of it, it might
[00:26:46.880 --> 00:26:51.440]   have been an, I wonder if it was an accessibility thing where as part of the debate internally,
[00:26:51.440 --> 00:26:55.440]   it was that this doesn't, this doesn't give all users the exact same experience. And therefore,
[00:26:55.920 --> 00:26:58.960]   we should delete the one that we can't support with the NSSER device.
[00:26:58.960 --> 00:27:04.240]   Or the, or was, might have been something as simple as they finally got around to like,
[00:27:04.240 --> 00:27:10.720]   basically rewriting that entire system. And when it came time to, oh, we forgot to put in the
[00:27:10.720 --> 00:27:17.040]   page curl thing, it's like, I am not going to go home at 11 p.m. tonight, because I've,
[00:27:17.040 --> 00:27:22.080]   because we needed to put in a page curl effect. Yeah, you get a page flip and I get to go home
[00:27:22.080 --> 00:27:26.320]   at eight. So your recommendation, Jason is none where you just tap it and kind of,
[00:27:26.320 --> 00:27:30.560]   it's that's quick to solve is what it is. I think it's a personal preference. I just, I always
[00:27:30.560 --> 00:27:34.880]   felt like that those animations were unnecessary, but I know that people love them and they're not
[00:27:34.880 --> 00:27:40.320]   because they're necessary, but because they're fun and that's fine. But I'm also, I recently reviewed
[00:27:40.320 --> 00:27:45.200]   a, which is kind of outside the purview of this show, but I reviewed a, an Android based
[00:27:45.200 --> 00:27:49.520]   ink reader. So it's like trying to be a Kindle, but it runs full Android. Yeah. And one of the
[00:27:49.520 --> 00:27:54.240]   problems I had is so many of the book reading apps and Android are like, we'll do fun animations.
[00:27:54.240 --> 00:27:59.600]   Yeah. And on an E-ink display, the fun animations end up being like an earthquake happens every
[00:27:59.600 --> 00:28:05.120]   time you try to change the page. They're really ugly and bad. So I, yes, I have a little animosity
[00:28:05.120 --> 00:28:09.360]   toward fun animations because of that experience. But in general, it's sort of like, I love that
[00:28:09.360 --> 00:28:14.000]   they give people the chance to do it. I love that that, that page curl is totally unnecessary.
[00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:20.400]   And I think that there is a school of thought that is probably, I probably supported that Apple,
[00:28:20.400 --> 00:28:24.160]   because it's so successful and it's reaches, it reaches so many people, especially with the
[00:28:24.160 --> 00:28:29.840]   iPhone that they've decided to kind of stamp out any whimsy. Because it's like, this is serious.
[00:28:29.840 --> 00:28:34.320]   We can't be whimsical. We have to serve our billions and billions of hamburgers instead.
[00:28:34.320 --> 00:28:39.760]   And the big page curls a great example of that. What does it serve? No, nothing. No reason.
[00:28:39.760 --> 00:28:45.280]   There's no, it doesn't help anything at all. It's completely gratuitous. But you know what it is?
[00:28:45.280 --> 00:28:52.720]   It's fun and whimsical. And so why destroy it, right? Like why, why kill that feature? So I'm glad it's
[00:28:52.720 --> 00:29:00.880]   back. I'm glad Microsoft, I know nobody here uses Windows, but Microsoft often when it really removes
[00:29:00.880 --> 00:29:07.520]   a feature or adds a feature, sites telemetry. They said, well, we know that no one uses that.
[00:29:07.520 --> 00:29:12.480]   You know, you may like it. You three people and you're very loud. But we know no one uses it.
[00:29:12.480 --> 00:29:20.480]   Does Apple have that kind of telemetry on its stuff? Do they know, for instance, that nobody
[00:29:20.480 --> 00:29:26.160]   has that turned on or? They do have some of that. Although remember, we did that, we covered that
[00:29:26.160 --> 00:29:30.960]   story here where you can turn that off or you have to opt in, but it was still sending data back.
[00:29:30.960 --> 00:29:35.760]   Right. We still have the end of our party. I know it says, you want to send information
[00:29:35.760 --> 00:29:41.600]   developers, but that's not Apple. I believe there is also the Apple telemetry that happens. I don't
[00:29:41.600 --> 00:29:46.240]   know how much they record, but you've got to think that through some method or other Apple has some
[00:29:46.240 --> 00:29:51.840]   detail. I don't know if it goes down to the level of do people use slash like the page curl? I don't
[00:29:51.840 --> 00:29:56.880]   think it's a bad thing to know. I think it's good to know. Like everybody has that turned off,
[00:29:56.880 --> 00:30:01.840]   except for, you know, one tenth to one percent of the users. And so my guess would be that that
[00:30:01.840 --> 00:30:06.880]   they had that. And that somebody said, well, why are we putting in this 400 lines of code to do
[00:30:06.880 --> 00:30:12.160]   something like one tenth to one percent does? And then that one tenth to one percent was loud
[00:30:12.160 --> 00:30:16.960]   and obnoxious. It's a real, it's a real argument stopper. If you're inside Apple and you're saying,
[00:30:16.960 --> 00:30:22.480]   but I like this, but I don't, you know, you could go has have as much a data as you could possibly
[00:30:22.480 --> 00:30:26.480]   have. But if you're like, nobody uses the feature, we have the proof that it's like, all right, I
[00:30:26.480 --> 00:30:30.160]   mean, what do you say to that? Okay, we have the proof. I'll take it out.
[00:30:30.160 --> 00:30:35.120]   I'll be right here. Nobody uses the chess app. Yeah. Why is that still there? Yeah.
[00:30:35.120 --> 00:30:39.520]   Somebody somebody. That's a really interesting point.
[00:30:39.520 --> 00:30:47.600]   Somebody. I think the last time that anybody at Apple said anything about that, it was a vague
[00:30:47.600 --> 00:30:54.000]   faint towards it's required for the for the security checksum to check the integrity of the
[00:30:54.000 --> 00:31:00.800]   install, i.e. if it's not there, then some piece of internal math goes goes wonky and they and it
[00:31:00.800 --> 00:31:05.920]   won't certify that this is a legit installation of of macOS. But that could I think that was a
[00:31:05.920 --> 00:31:12.800]   while ago. And I never understood that explanation to begin with. Yeah. Well, there you have it. Now
[00:31:12.800 --> 00:31:19.520]   iOS 17 is next. Actually, will there be a 16 5 16 6? I guess there'll be a one more up there.
[00:31:19.520 --> 00:31:25.840]   There's a there's a beta already out there. They just started the beta cycle of 16 5
[00:31:25.840 --> 00:31:30.880]   and presumably there'll be a macOS. Yeah, 13 for beta. This will be the last. This is like the bug
[00:31:30.880 --> 00:31:35.360]   fix cleanup that comes up right before WWDC and is just there probably to sweep out the last
[00:31:35.360 --> 00:31:40.160]   bugs that they're going to fix or anything or a security issue. And we should say that Apple
[00:31:40.160 --> 00:31:45.040]   will push out security fixes it whenever necessary immediately. Right. Yeah. Right. In fact, there
[00:31:45.040 --> 00:31:50.320]   were some security fixes along with this release for previous releases. Right. Right. Right. So the
[00:31:50.320 --> 00:31:56.800]   reason I mentioned that is Mark Gurman has tweeted when Apple set out to develop iOS 17, which I
[00:31:56.800 --> 00:32:01.200]   guess would come out with the new iPhones in the fall, the initial thinking was to call it a tune
[00:32:01.200 --> 00:32:06.800]   up release one focused up more on fixing bugs and improving performance and adding new features
[00:32:06.800 --> 00:32:12.240]   kind of like they did with Snow Leopard back in 2009. The hope was to avoid the problems
[00:32:13.040 --> 00:32:18.880]   of iOS 16, which was an ambitious update that suffered from missed deadlines and a buggy start.
[00:32:18.880 --> 00:32:24.320]   But later in the development process, the strategy changed. I presume this is Gurman sources.
[00:32:24.320 --> 00:32:31.280]   The iOS 17 releases now expected to boast several nice to have features and he puts nice to have
[00:32:31.280 --> 00:32:37.520]   in quotes. Even if it lacks a tent pole improvement like last year's revamped locked screen,
[00:32:37.520 --> 00:32:43.840]   the goal of the software code named Dawn is to check off several of users most requested
[00:32:43.840 --> 00:32:51.600]   features. He does not elaborate on which those features are. I'll just point out that Snow Leopard,
[00:32:51.600 --> 00:32:55.600]   which everybody always uses is the base the baseline for this. Like let's have another Snow
[00:32:55.600 --> 00:33:02.000]   Leopard release where they just fixed things. Snow Leopard had I think hundreds of new features.
[00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:08.480]   Like it's hard to keep the new features out. But I think that no big tent pole is maybe an example
[00:33:08.480 --> 00:33:12.560]   of this where they're like doing quality of life improvements and bug fixes and also probably
[00:33:12.560 --> 00:33:17.120]   spending most of their engineers time on the VR headset instead of the the car.
[00:33:17.120 --> 00:33:24.720]   It's fine with me pulling people off of teams to do the VR.
[00:33:24.720 --> 00:33:30.880]   But six updates are great. Let's do it. I'm sold on that. We don't need the pace of innovation
[00:33:30.880 --> 00:33:36.400]   and pushing out new features and rewriting old apps has been great and messy.
[00:33:36.400 --> 00:33:42.800]   I would welcome some small tweaks that make life better and some fixes and just letting...
[00:33:42.800 --> 00:33:47.760]   I'm in the midst of running a survey for a bunch of IT professionals. If I hear anything from them,
[00:33:47.760 --> 00:33:54.080]   it's like slow it down. The annual treadmill for if you're supporting a large number of devices
[00:33:54.080 --> 00:33:59.520]   is brutal. I get why Apple does it especially for the iPhone, but that Mac on an annual release
[00:33:59.520 --> 00:34:05.840]   cycle is really tough. So if they back off and just let it cool down for a year, I think that's great.
[00:34:05.840 --> 00:34:14.560]   Yeah. Mostly I'm hoping that they take another Gwack at stage manager because when they debuted
[00:34:14.560 --> 00:34:20.880]   it last year, they didn't make a good enough case for people to leave it turned on. I rarely see
[00:34:20.880 --> 00:34:27.280]   people actually using it in the wild. I don't think it's bad. I just think that it doesn't present an
[00:34:27.280 --> 00:34:32.000]   immediate sense of, "Oh, this is going to be inconvenient to learn this new thing, but oh,
[00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:37.840]   boy, is it going to be worth it?" I would love to see them. This was the very first cut at
[00:34:37.840 --> 00:34:44.240]   probably one of the most significant user interface updates and changes to iOS
[00:34:44.240 --> 00:34:50.240]   tandem with Mac OS since, gosh, since ever. They're not going to get it right the first time. You
[00:34:50.240 --> 00:34:56.880]   could expect that it's going to continue to evolve. I'm interested to see, again, do they decide that
[00:34:56.880 --> 00:35:03.360]   let's just let this lay fallow and pretend that this didn't really exist? Or are they really
[00:35:03.360 --> 00:35:07.840]   energetically going to be piling on, "Okay, we have seen how people use it. We've seen what the
[00:35:07.840 --> 00:35:12.240]   complaints are. We ourselves have been dogfooding it. Here is some adjustments that we've made to
[00:35:12.240 --> 00:35:22.720]   how it works to make it seem more essential." What would you want in an iOS 17? I agree with the IT
[00:35:22.720 --> 00:35:29.040]   folks. By the way, we hear this on Windows as well. They say, "We don't stop. Just make it good.
[00:35:29.040 --> 00:35:36.800]   Don't change it. Just make it good." Is there anything though that's missing from iOS 16 that we
[00:35:36.800 --> 00:35:43.360]   should have? I'd like them to move the iPhone features that aren't on the iPad to the iPad this
[00:35:43.360 --> 00:35:47.200]   year, which is like that move the lock screen and the widgets and stuff over there. There's a bunch
[00:35:47.200 --> 00:35:52.480]   of things that they just didn't bring to the iPad. So that's an existing feature
[00:35:52.480 --> 00:35:58.320]   moving. It's funny. I talked about this on my upgrade podcast with Mike Hurley on Monday.
[00:35:58.320 --> 00:36:02.960]   Then later that day, Cable Sasser from Panic wrote a blog post about it. It's in the water now,
[00:36:02.960 --> 00:36:07.200]   which is Apple has this amazing new password manager that they've been building for the last
[00:36:07.200 --> 00:36:13.360]   few years. I actually have on my wish list, make it an app. It's hidden in the Settings app.
[00:36:13.360 --> 00:36:18.800]   Trying to explain to a friend or family member that Apple has a password manager,
[00:36:18.800 --> 00:36:24.640]   but you have to dig down in Settings, I would love to see Apple just pull it out and make it an app
[00:36:24.640 --> 00:36:29.040]   so that you can point to it and say, "Look, your password's going that app that Apple is giving you."
[00:36:29.040 --> 00:36:34.400]   They sync to all your devices and it'll keep track of all your passwords because it is a
[00:36:34.400 --> 00:36:40.880]   conceptual leap to explain that there's a subset in the Settings app.
[00:36:42.320 --> 00:36:50.560]   Siri's talking to us. No, it's carrot, unfortunately. I like when I was my mom,
[00:36:50.560 --> 00:36:57.200]   I got her off of her paper notebook that she's addicted to and onto Apple's password manager.
[00:36:57.200 --> 00:37:02.720]   Half off, she still goes back to it. She relapses every now and then. But the biggest conceptual leap
[00:37:02.720 --> 00:37:07.840]   when I was trying to work it out with her was where you go to see it, not in Safari, but where
[00:37:07.840 --> 00:37:15.760]   does it live? It's in the Settings app. It's very hard for her to take that conceptual leap,
[00:37:15.760 --> 00:37:21.040]   whereas pointing to her to an app has never been a problem. I think that a lot of people are like
[00:37:21.040 --> 00:37:25.440]   that. Can you think that the reason that they don't make it an app is to keep it a little hidden
[00:37:25.440 --> 00:37:30.000]   so that if you don't know what you're doing, you're not exposing the passwords all the time.
[00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:36.080]   Like open them up. It feels like they do that to kind of, "Hey, if you don't know what you're doing,
[00:37:36.080 --> 00:37:38.800]   we're going to keep it hidden and just kind of do it in the back end. And if you do know what you're
[00:37:38.800 --> 00:37:43.280]   doing, then we're going to let you play with it, but you could do damage if you're starting to
[00:37:43.280 --> 00:37:46.720]   cut things down." Why would you ever need to open it? Isn't the autofill sufficient?
[00:37:46.720 --> 00:37:52.000]   Well, I mean, there are some sites where autofill doesn't work, right? And I find myself using the
[00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:55.600]   one password app all the time to dig in there, plus the idea that you could leave yourself
[00:37:55.600 --> 00:38:01.200]   potentially like secure notes or just look up a password or whatever it is. I agree there's a
[00:38:01.200 --> 00:38:06.000]   there's a paternalistic kind of side to this, which is like, look, all we're doing is calling people
[00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:10.160]   on this. Maybe we don't want them to do that. And I think that I can see that argument. I just feel
[00:38:10.160 --> 00:38:15.680]   like at this point, it's so important that everybody use a password manager that getting in their
[00:38:15.680 --> 00:38:20.560]   faces with an app. I mean, there's a tips app, right? Like getting in their faces with a password app
[00:38:20.560 --> 00:38:26.320]   and saying, "You need to use this for your passwords." I think they should. I think it's probably
[00:38:26.320 --> 00:38:29.920]   better that they do that. I think the concern is that someone, people will start doing things like,
[00:38:29.920 --> 00:38:33.280]   "Let me cut and paste that password and text it to you or email it to you or whatever."
[00:38:33.280 --> 00:38:37.360]   And it's you're more likely to do that when you know where the passwords are. And if you do know
[00:38:37.360 --> 00:38:41.600]   where they are, you know, like, you know, but if it's doing it in the background and kind of making
[00:38:41.600 --> 00:38:45.280]   it happen, you know, and you don't really understand it and just get you into what you need to get to
[00:38:45.280 --> 00:38:51.200]   as a kind of an average user or, you know, starter, it kind of protects you from yourself. And if you
[00:38:51.200 --> 00:38:56.320]   are geeky enough to get into the settings, they think, well, maybe you've graduated to the point
[00:38:56.320 --> 00:39:00.240]   where you can start cutting your past Word, cutting your pastiness and it's just for people who are
[00:39:00.240 --> 00:39:04.080]   listening and going, what are they talking about? In settings where you go to passwords where you
[00:39:04.080 --> 00:39:08.960]   would think normally what you're doing is setting passwords settings. There's actually a list of
[00:39:08.960 --> 00:39:14.880]   all your passwords. And you can go there, you can create new passwords there. It looks just like
[00:39:14.880 --> 00:39:22.000]   a regular password manager. And there's also the Keychain Access app that most people don't use
[00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:29.760]   because this is a very iOS. Well, iOS, I'm sorry. I agree. Yeah, I agree. It's necessary on
[00:39:29.760 --> 00:39:37.520]   macOS as well. Yeah. I mean, I do open Keychain and that is an app. Right. But, you know, it's
[00:39:37.520 --> 00:39:42.880]   doubly necessary on iOS. Yeah. Yeah. I would like, I like your first proposal, which is essentially
[00:39:42.880 --> 00:39:48.560]   maybe Apple made a mistake separating iOS and iPadOS. Essentially, shouldn't all the features of
[00:39:48.560 --> 00:39:56.640]   iOS be common on both platforms or no? They kind of are, are they? Not widgets, not, well,
[00:39:56.640 --> 00:40:01.920]   widgets are. What is it that you said they should have, Jason, you had some list of things.
[00:40:01.920 --> 00:40:08.880]   Oh, well, I mean, on between iPad and iPhone, right? Yes. iPadOS for iOS.
[00:40:08.880 --> 00:40:14.960]   Yeah. That's the biggest thing. At this point, the Mac and the iPad are kind of in lockstep,
[00:40:14.960 --> 00:40:20.400]   which I think is a good thing. And I know a lot of Mac users who are cranky old Mac users,
[00:40:20.400 --> 00:40:25.520]   which Andy and I are too, I think, although maybe not as cranky. Remember, like, it's like,
[00:40:25.520 --> 00:40:29.760]   ah, but it's not a Mac feature. It's this thing imported from the iPad. But like, do you remember
[00:40:29.760 --> 00:40:35.040]   the 2010s when the iPad and the iPhone got all these new features and the Mac either didn't get
[00:40:35.040 --> 00:40:38.720]   it for a year or two or got it, but only about half the features and the other half of the
[00:40:38.720 --> 00:40:43.120]   features just didn't work. And that doesn't happen anymore. So I'm very happy that the Mac
[00:40:43.120 --> 00:40:47.360]   and the iPad kind of move forward in lockstep now. That's pretty good. But I'm not happy that
[00:40:47.360 --> 00:40:51.200]   the iPhone gets these features and they're like, yeah, we could have brought it to the iPad, but,
[00:40:51.200 --> 00:40:56.240]   yeah, we didn't this year. It's literally the same operating system. But, yeah, we, no, you don't
[00:40:56.240 --> 00:41:00.400]   get it. You don't get those customizable lock screens and lock screen widgets and just, you know,
[00:41:00.400 --> 00:41:08.640]   wait a year maybe. So cable sasser is the panic guy software guy Apple passwords deserve an app.
[00:41:08.640 --> 00:41:17.520]   It's in his blog at cable cab el dot com. It's funny that they have all of this. They even have
[00:41:17.520 --> 00:41:25.360]   don't they have two FA in it too? Oh, yeah. Yeah. So he's got some tweets. Do you know what Apple
[00:41:25.360 --> 00:41:31.040]   should do build a two FA authenticator in iOS? It's already there. Yeah, how about a password
[00:41:31.040 --> 00:41:39.920]   manager? It's already there. So I agree with cable. I agree with you. Maybe they will. Maybe they will.
[00:41:39.920 --> 00:41:45.280]   The problem is right now it's not cross platform. So if you're an Android user, it's not going to
[00:41:45.280 --> 00:41:51.600]   do you any good windows you can, right? Because it doesn't the iCloud app now give you access to
[00:41:51.600 --> 00:41:58.000]   passwords and windows. I think it does. Yes. Yeah. In fact, it's more standalone than it is on
[00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:04.320]   the Mac or is that funny? Yeah. But that is a reason why I think that users should have access to
[00:42:04.320 --> 00:42:08.880]   that sort of stuff. Because sometimes you do have to get the number of times where I've got my
[00:42:08.880 --> 00:42:13.680]   password for something on one password manager, but I need to use it on another device or on
[00:42:13.680 --> 00:42:19.440]   other desktop that doesn't have cross compatibility. Yeah, then I do actually need to have I do need
[00:42:19.440 --> 00:42:26.000]   to actually see the 18 digit random passcode that I had my password manager generate for me because
[00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:32.400]   I'm not going to remember that stuff. So give give give you know, my consistent belief is that
[00:42:32.400 --> 00:42:36.640]   give people the ability to get themselves in trouble, but try to steer them away from it. But
[00:42:36.640 --> 00:42:41.200]   don't like say that no, no, no, no, I'm not going to let you see that. I don't trust you with
[00:42:41.200 --> 00:42:45.680]   enough to let you see what your own passwords are. So you'll thank me later. Like, no, I won't. I'll
[00:42:45.680 --> 00:42:55.200]   be angry. You know, Mr. Cook is has gone to China again. He he is in China. Praising Apple's
[00:42:55.200 --> 00:43:04.240]   symbiotic relationship with China. What a bad choice of words. Oh, Lord of a but it's it is kind
[00:43:04.240 --> 00:43:10.640]   of true, right? At least until he can move all that manufacturing to Vietnam or India or Brazil.
[00:43:10.640 --> 00:43:14.080]   Oftentimes when you're getting ready to leave is when you're the nicest. Yeah.
[00:43:14.080 --> 00:43:18.080]   We love you guys. Bye. I think Apple Apple one of you.
[00:43:18.080 --> 00:43:24.480]   You want to use it? It's him saying it's not me. It's you. No, it's not you. It's me. That's what
[00:43:24.480 --> 00:43:29.280]   he's saying. I think it's it's a face saving thing for China. Well, Apple, you know, Apple's
[00:43:29.280 --> 00:43:33.440]   moving a bunch of stuff out of it. People are panicked. The Chinese government is not something
[00:43:33.440 --> 00:43:38.000]   you want to cross, especially when all your eggs are in their basket. So I think that him showing
[00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:43.680]   up and talking saying great things while he's going to continue to diversify, I think probably
[00:43:43.680 --> 00:43:49.680]   makes it business. He is at the China Development Forum in Beijing, which financial time says the
[00:43:49.680 --> 00:43:56.480]   country's version of Davos first time since the pandemic began. We could not be more excited,
[00:43:56.480 --> 00:44:03.440]   Cook said, Apple and China grew together. And so this has been a symbiotic kind of relationship.
[00:44:03.440 --> 00:44:08.960]   Who is the fungus and who is the tree? That's the question.
[00:44:08.960 --> 00:44:14.080]   Wow. If it's true symbiosis, right? They're both they're both everything for this. I think
[00:44:14.080 --> 00:44:22.640]   that's a lot less weird than you might think because what he's saying is Apple needs China and China
[00:44:22.640 --> 00:44:28.080]   needs Apple. China has benefited from Apple and Apple has benefited from China. And that is different
[00:44:28.080 --> 00:44:32.640]   than I think what is sometimes portrayed, which is that it's a one way street that Apple has made
[00:44:32.640 --> 00:44:38.480]   it big by being in China, but China could cut them off whenever they want. And I, you know,
[00:44:38.480 --> 00:44:43.680]   I think that there is a case to be made that China has benefited from having Apple in its factories
[00:44:43.680 --> 00:44:49.040]   and also having Apple products available in its stores where people in China can buy Apple products,
[00:44:49.040 --> 00:44:55.040]   which are good and well liked products. So it is a symbiotic relationship. But yeah, it's also
[00:44:55.040 --> 00:45:01.200]   don't feel bad. Yes, we're I mean, we talked about this before, but like it's we're using the
[00:45:01.200 --> 00:45:08.080]   pandemic shutdowns as a good pretext to say, Oh, we need to diversify our global reach. But, but,
[00:45:08.080 --> 00:45:12.320]   but not because we don't like you. It's because we just need diversification in general.
[00:45:12.320 --> 00:45:16.320]   When the truth is it's, you know, it's also let's not have everything in China,
[00:45:16.320 --> 00:45:19.760]   not because we don't like you, but because you're acting crazy.
[00:45:19.760 --> 00:45:28.000]   I know that it's not you. It's me. Yeah. Yeah. We wish China the best of luck in its future endeavors.
[00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:35.360]   Meanwhile, China in the shape of chairman of national development and reform commission
[00:45:35.360 --> 00:45:42.000]   Jiang Shanjie said, Apple needs to strengthen its data security and personal privacy protection.
[00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:51.520]   You need to do a better job. Yeah. That was that was the only quote that we got from this
[00:45:51.520 --> 00:45:56.560]   meeting between a lot of this a lot of stuff that's coming out of this is group meetings between
[00:45:56.560 --> 00:46:03.200]   Tim Cook and other like C suite executives with with China's China representatives. I think that
[00:46:03.200 --> 00:46:09.200]   the Reuters report has this as a one on one. I'm looking at I'm looking at the original
[00:46:09.200 --> 00:46:13.120]   Roy's report. And yeah, this but this is consistent with what they've been saying to pretty much
[00:46:13.120 --> 00:46:18.400]   every Western company that when they talk about, you need to tighten up your security. You need
[00:46:18.400 --> 00:46:24.880]   to be better better, better controlled. A lot of it is truly giving your users better security
[00:46:24.880 --> 00:46:28.320]   than you're giving them in the United States. But a lot of them is that we have our own data
[00:46:28.320 --> 00:46:33.040]   protection practices that require you to have more of your data transacted by and landed
[00:46:33.040 --> 00:46:37.760]   in China. If you're being if you're operating through Chinese citizens. And so basically their
[00:46:37.760 --> 00:46:43.120]   idea is that the more data we can see the more secure your more secure your data is. So there's
[00:46:43.120 --> 00:46:47.360]   a little bit of both going on there. Yeah, the two sides exchange and you're right. Reuters
[00:46:47.360 --> 00:46:55.760]   didn't say but they implied that it was a one on one when Jiang Shanjie met with Apple CEO yesterday.
[00:46:55.760 --> 00:47:01.920]   But they didn't exactly say two sides. The statement from China's Ministry of Commerce says the two
[00:47:01.920 --> 00:47:07.760]   sides exchange views on issues such as Apple's development in China and the stabilization of
[00:47:07.760 --> 00:47:15.280]   the industrial and supply chains. Do you think behind closed doors, Tim kind of took him by the
[00:47:15.280 --> 00:47:21.760]   lapels and said what I do. I do not know. I don't think that I don't know. I don't know.
[00:47:21.760 --> 00:47:27.600]   I don't hear and said he's too good to diplomat. He's too good. I think that he's just he has no
[00:47:27.600 --> 00:47:32.960]   interest in having any interaction with China that would be tense. It's just like hey we're doing
[00:47:32.960 --> 00:47:37.120]   great. How do we move this forward? How do we do these things? Yeah, I know that we're moving
[00:47:37.120 --> 00:47:42.720]   into the country. We have to diversify and it's easy to go into places like India that require,
[00:47:42.720 --> 00:47:48.240]   Brazil and India require the production to be there. But Vietnam is a little different.
[00:47:48.240 --> 00:47:54.240]   China will become more and more paranoid about this because everybody's trying to figure this out.
[00:47:54.240 --> 00:48:00.880]   Right. Tim is a supreme politician, I think, when it comes to China. During the last couple
[00:48:00.880 --> 00:48:04.640]   years of the Trump administration, people said that he was basically the US ambassador to China
[00:48:04.640 --> 00:48:10.480]   in some ways. He was the one that the Chinese talk to the most. But obviously, he's got
[00:48:10.480 --> 00:48:17.120]   a real diplomatic challenge here. Like Alex said, you want to make it clear that they're not losing
[00:48:17.120 --> 00:48:21.760]   face because they know what's going on. They know that Apple's concerned that if there's a US
[00:48:21.760 --> 00:48:26.720]   China rupture that Apple's entire business is going to be destroyed. So they know that Apple
[00:48:26.720 --> 00:48:32.640]   needs to show some diversification even if it's just for the sake of Wall Street feeling more
[00:48:32.640 --> 00:48:37.440]   comfortable. But Tim Cook also knows that China doesn't want to feel like Apple is abandoning them.
[00:48:37.440 --> 00:48:42.080]   And so you play a game where everybody says the right thing and make sure that everybody feels
[00:48:42.080 --> 00:48:46.800]   good about what's going on when we know what's going on, which is Apple's not leaving China,
[00:48:46.800 --> 00:48:50.560]   but Apple realizes it can't just be in China. And so here we are.
[00:48:51.280 --> 00:48:54.960]   And they're also giving Apple's also getting something valuable to China, which is
[00:48:54.960 --> 00:49:00.320]   these very, very public and enthusiastic statements of support. The economy in China is
[00:49:00.320 --> 00:49:06.320]   having problems just like everybody else is having problems. The middle class is getting a
[00:49:06.320 --> 00:49:10.880]   lot more antsy than they were just five years ago, not just with the lockdowns, but with the state
[00:49:10.880 --> 00:49:17.600]   of the economy itself. So just like it was wise for Tim to allow Donald Trump to have a massive
[00:49:17.600 --> 00:49:22.400]   campaign slash press event at an Apple factory in Texas. It's very much to the
[00:49:22.400 --> 00:49:26.800]   Tim's and Apple's advantage to make sure that you have these statements in line in which you're
[00:49:26.800 --> 00:49:30.640]   not simply waffling. You're not just simply you're having open frank frank and open
[00:49:30.640 --> 00:49:35.280]   communications that you're being one of the speakers of this conference and that you are 100%
[00:49:35.280 --> 00:49:40.240]   enthusiastic about the partnership that you forged with this sort of this friendly nation
[00:49:40.240 --> 00:49:44.320]   that you intend to keep on thriving strong together hand in hand marching forward
[00:49:44.320 --> 00:49:50.320]   of until Kingdom come. So this is just a feeling I should be humming patriotic music behind that
[00:49:50.320 --> 00:49:55.840]   as Andy has a do speak here. I mean, you're but yeah, I mean, Jason, you're absolutely right. I don't
[00:49:55.840 --> 00:50:02.080]   I don't know any, but it's it's amazing that you have two CEOs back to back at Apple with so
[00:50:02.080 --> 00:50:09.360]   completely opposite set of skills in this regard. You know, you would not consider the word
[00:50:09.360 --> 00:50:15.760]   diplomatic when it comes to Steve Jobs in any way, shape or form. And yet the success that
[00:50:15.760 --> 00:50:22.320]   that Tim Cook has had is largely because he is able to simply let's keep my poker face. Let's
[00:50:22.320 --> 00:50:27.280]   here is here is a tactical relationship that is very, very good for both of us. Let's find a way
[00:50:27.280 --> 00:50:31.920]   to make sure this is a strong relationship where nobody's talking to Trump. Let's make sure that
[00:50:31.920 --> 00:50:35.840]   Apple is talking to Trump. If nobody's talking to China, let's make sure that at least Apple is
[00:50:35.840 --> 00:50:41.920]   talking to China. I wonder how deep that goes because it's it's it's it's it's one of the greatest
[00:50:41.920 --> 00:50:48.400]   assets that that Tim Cook can provide his role of decks and his handshake. It really, really moves
[00:50:48.400 --> 00:50:52.320]   a lot of money across the across the boardroom. And I think I think that, you know,
[00:50:52.320 --> 00:50:58.800]   Apple wouldn't be here without Steve Jobs. And it wouldn't have grown to where it is now without
[00:50:58.800 --> 00:51:04.400]   Tim Cook. It's it's a yeah, you know, I think those those very two very different things. I
[00:51:04.400 --> 00:51:08.560]   agree with Andy that it was just in everyone here, I think. But I think that it's just I don't think
[00:51:08.560 --> 00:51:12.320]   Steve could have gotten the company to the size that it is now with that. You know, Tim Cook is what
[00:51:12.320 --> 00:51:18.400]   did that? You know, and maybe we've had another break through product. I don't know. But maybe
[00:51:18.400 --> 00:51:23.760]   but but the the skill that he's had Tim Cook would have told a lot of people to go fly a kite.
[00:51:23.760 --> 00:51:28.400]   Steve Cook Steve Jobs would have. Yeah, Tim, I'm sorry. I'm amazed when the people say, Oh, well,
[00:51:28.400 --> 00:51:32.960]   Tim Cook's legacy is the Apple Watch or maybe it'll be the VR headset. It's like, Tim Cook's legacy.
[00:51:32.960 --> 00:51:37.200]   Have you? I mean, maybe I'm special because I look at those quarterly reports every quarter.
[00:51:37.200 --> 00:51:42.240]   But let me tell you, Tim Cook's legacy is very clear. Apple is many, many times the size it was
[00:51:42.240 --> 00:51:46.800]   when Steve Jobs died. And Steve Jobs wasn't that engaged in that part of the company for several
[00:51:46.800 --> 00:51:54.240]   years before that. It that is Tim Cook's legacy is he has made Apple scale enormously and and
[00:51:54.240 --> 00:51:59.360]   done it using I mean, yes, the iPhone's been successful, but he's played that success and done a bunch
[00:51:59.360 --> 00:52:03.280]   of stuff on the operation side and changed the way Apple markets its products. And like,
[00:52:03.280 --> 00:52:08.320]   that's his legacy is that Apple is not even remotely the company it was when he took over.
[00:52:08.320 --> 00:52:13.520]   100%. I'm not I'm not even sure that he would have greenlit something like a car. I'm not sure
[00:52:13.520 --> 00:52:17.920]   that he would have been made as big a push into a lot of the product lines that they're pushing
[00:52:17.920 --> 00:52:23.520]   into right now because these are it's it's it's weird that Apple's doing so many so many so many
[00:52:23.520 --> 00:52:30.080]   projects that are really speculative in nature whose payoff is by no means assured or even
[00:52:30.080 --> 00:52:36.160]   suggested by the work that they're doing. So yeah, I mean, that's 100%. I think Apple though does
[00:52:36.160 --> 00:52:40.720]   at the scale that it's working at it can't you know, like if you look at what happened before
[00:52:40.720 --> 00:52:45.600]   Apple showed up with Nokia, you just felt like the their cell phone business was going to last forever.
[00:52:45.600 --> 00:52:50.800]   And then it was gone in a couple years, like it was just it just that fast. And so I think that
[00:52:50.800 --> 00:52:55.040]   Apple still has to keep on playing with the next big thing and trying to figure out what
[00:52:55.040 --> 00:52:59.280]   something that can replace the size of the iPhone when it comes to revenue and it may
[00:52:59.280 --> 00:53:04.320]   may not be AR may not be cars, but they have to be thinking about those things because you know that
[00:53:04.320 --> 00:53:09.280]   that I think anybody who looks back at what happened when the phone the iPhone was released
[00:53:09.280 --> 00:53:16.800]   realizes how quickly something can turn a market because that for Motorola for Nokia for everyone
[00:53:16.800 --> 00:53:20.880]   that was Armageddon, you know, and they didn't even see and they didn't they didn't see it coming.
[00:53:20.880 --> 00:53:24.560]   They thought that it was foolish by Apple to do it. They thought there was no chance of that.
[00:53:24.560 --> 00:53:29.360]   I remember all these quotes of like Apple's going to learn the big what it's like with the big boys
[00:53:29.360 --> 00:53:33.120]   and same thing we saw with watches. You know, like it was like Apple's going to learn this
[00:53:33.120 --> 00:53:37.600]   a lot more complicated than they think it is. And and then suddenly they you know, they rolled
[00:53:37.600 --> 00:53:42.640]   into it, but that market changed so quickly and just turned over. And so I think Apple has to keep
[00:53:42.640 --> 00:53:47.040]   on doing hard things. They have to keep on figuring that out. You know, they I think it's easier
[00:53:47.040 --> 00:53:51.200]   wins than than AR and cars. I think that again, we've talked about I think that they just built
[00:53:51.200 --> 00:53:55.840]   some of the home kit stuff. They probably add another $15 billion a year to just selling
[00:53:55.840 --> 00:54:02.720]   thermostats and and locks and cameras, you know, like it's just like because a lot of people just
[00:54:02.720 --> 00:54:09.120]   buy those because still none of them are working. Maybe someday. Do you think there so it's interesting
[00:54:09.760 --> 00:54:15.680]   contention that there's stuff that Tim Cook doesn't wish you know, wishes Apple weren't doing but can't
[00:54:15.680 --> 00:54:20.960]   stop. He doesn't have 100% control over that. He can't say, no, I didn't want to do that.
[00:54:20.960 --> 00:54:24.800]   Now let's not do that. I think he would kill it. I think he would kill it. I didn't want if he
[00:54:24.800 --> 00:54:29.120]   didn't want to do it. I think that I think that they I think both of those are pretty there's going
[00:54:29.120 --> 00:54:34.000]   to be a self driving car electric car or just even electric car, but most likely self driving car
[00:54:34.000 --> 00:54:37.040]   in the next decade that a lot of people are going to start using it doesn't have to be that they
[00:54:37.040 --> 00:54:42.240]   don't have to own the market to make a lot of money doing that. And it's just prudent to do that work.
[00:54:42.240 --> 00:54:46.560]   They have the money to do it. It's right to do the work, right? And just to get that.
[00:54:46.560 --> 00:54:47.120]   Yeah. Yeah.
[00:54:47.120 --> 00:54:47.120]   Yeah.
[00:54:47.120 --> 00:54:52.960]   We're thinking hedging the market because the problem is with with both AR and with cars,
[00:54:52.960 --> 00:54:59.600]   the the the development time to get it right is so long. Yeah.
[00:54:59.600 --> 00:55:03.360]   They have to work on it. They could they could not have a company left if they have one of those,
[00:55:03.360 --> 00:55:07.040]   you know, like by the time they figured out how to do it. So you have to kind of play that play
[00:55:07.040 --> 00:55:10.080]   that game along unless you're just going to buy into into the market and that's not what Apple
[00:55:10.080 --> 00:55:13.280]   wants to do. They want to do it their way. They don't want to buy something they did. I mean,
[00:55:13.280 --> 00:55:17.120]   they did it with beats, but they really just needed iTunes or they just needed music and they needed
[00:55:17.120 --> 00:55:20.800]   and they didn't mean the headphones didn't mean anything to them.
[00:55:20.800 --> 00:55:25.520]   When when such in Adela took over at Microsoft, he wasted no time to kill some things he just
[00:55:25.520 --> 00:55:30.640]   didn't want to do, including quite famously a product they were about to reveal. And he just
[00:55:30.640 --> 00:55:33.920]   said, no, no, put that back in the warehouse. They'd already made them.
[00:55:33.920 --> 00:55:39.440]   So, you know, it's not unheard of for a guy to come in. I guess it'd be different though for
[00:55:39.440 --> 00:55:47.120]   Tim, given that Steve had just passed and it was like, you know, he's got Johnny I have to deal with.
[00:55:47.120 --> 00:55:52.240]   It might have been politically difficult for him to say to do the same kind of size wielding.
[00:55:52.240 --> 00:55:56.560]   Anyway, let's take a break. I want to take a little break because I do want to talk about
[00:55:56.560 --> 00:56:00.160]   the headsets. I know we're kind of endlessly talking about that, but
[00:56:00.160 --> 00:56:06.800]   we should. There's a new Apple, long announced, finally out Apple product. We can talk about
[00:56:06.800 --> 00:56:13.280]   just a bit. And I left out something. I forgot that they updated Ventura too. So,
[00:56:13.280 --> 00:56:17.760]   if there's anything to say about that, it sounds like it's much of the same stuff that
[00:56:17.760 --> 00:56:24.720]   they updated with 16.4 on iOS. But we can talk about that. But first a word from us
[00:56:25.280 --> 00:56:31.040]   about sponsorship. Hey, everybody, Leo LaPorte here. I'm the founder and one of the hosts at the
[00:56:31.040 --> 00:56:36.400]   Twit podcast network. I want to talk to you a little bit about what we do here at Twit because
[00:56:36.400 --> 00:56:45.040]   I think it's unique. And I think for anybody who is bringing a product or a service to a tech
[00:56:45.040 --> 00:56:51.040]   audience, you need to know about what we do here at Twit. We've built an amazing audience of
[00:56:51.040 --> 00:56:58.240]   engaged, intelligent, affluent listeners who listen to us and trust us when we recommend
[00:56:58.240 --> 00:57:03.840]   a product. Our mission statement is to build a highly engaged community of tech enthusiasts.
[00:57:03.840 --> 00:57:09.520]   Already, you should be your ears should be perking up at that because highly engaged
[00:57:09.520 --> 00:57:14.160]   is good for you. Tech enthusiasts, if that's who you're looking for, this is the place.
[00:57:14.160 --> 00:57:19.600]   We do it by offering them the knowledge they need to understand and use technology in today's world.
[00:57:19.600 --> 00:57:24.960]   And I hear from our audience all the time, part of that knowledge comes from our advertisers.
[00:57:24.960 --> 00:57:31.440]   We are very careful. We pick advertisers with great products, great services with integrity
[00:57:31.440 --> 00:57:39.280]   and introduce them to our audience with authenticity and genuine enthusiasm. And that makes our
[00:57:39.280 --> 00:57:44.320]   host red ads different from anything else you can buy. We are literally bringing you
[00:57:45.040 --> 00:57:51.360]   to the attention of our audience and giving you a big fat endorsement. We like to create
[00:57:51.360 --> 00:57:57.120]   partnerships with trusted brands, brands who are in it for the long run, long term partners
[00:57:57.120 --> 00:58:02.720]   that want to grow with us. And we have so many great success stories. Tim Broome,
[00:58:02.720 --> 00:58:09.120]   who founded ITProTV in 2013, started advertising with us on day one has been with us ever since.
[00:58:09.120 --> 00:58:14.800]   He said, quote, "We would not be where we are today without the Twit Network."
[00:58:14.800 --> 00:58:19.520]   I think the proof is in the pudding. Advertisers like ITProTV and Audible,
[00:58:19.520 --> 00:58:26.080]   they've been with us for more than 10 years. They stick around because their ads work. And honestly,
[00:58:26.080 --> 00:58:31.680]   isn't that why you're buying advertising? You get a lot with Twit. We have a very full service
[00:58:31.680 --> 00:58:37.440]   attitude. We almost think of it as kind of artisanal advertising, boutique advertising.
[00:58:37.440 --> 00:58:43.360]   You'll get a full service continuity team. People who are on the phone with you, who are in touch
[00:58:43.360 --> 00:58:49.840]   with you, who support you with everything from copywriting to graphic design. So you are not
[00:58:49.840 --> 00:58:57.600]   alone in this. We embed our ads into the shows. They're not added later. They're part of the shows.
[00:58:57.600 --> 00:59:03.040]   In fact, often, they're such a part of our shows that our other hosts will chime in on the ad saying,
[00:59:03.040 --> 00:59:08.560]   "Yeah, I love that." Or just the other day, one of our hosts said, "Man, I really got to buy that.
[00:59:09.280 --> 00:59:15.040]   That's an additional benefit to you because you're hearing people, our audience trusts saying,
[00:59:15.040 --> 00:59:21.040]   "Yeah, that sounds great." We deliver, always over-deliver on impressions. So you know you're
[00:59:21.040 --> 00:59:26.560]   going to get the impressions you expect. The ads are unique every time. We don't pre-record
[00:59:26.560 --> 00:59:31.920]   them and roll them in. We are genuinely doing those ads in the middle of the show. We'll give you
[00:59:31.920 --> 00:59:38.000]   great onboarding services. AdTech with pod sites that's free for direct clients, gives you a lot
[00:59:38.000 --> 00:59:42.560]   of reporting, gives you a great idea of how well your ads are working. You'll get courtesy commercials.
[00:59:42.560 --> 00:59:47.440]   You actually can take our ads and share them across social media and landing pages. That really
[00:59:47.440 --> 00:59:52.320]   extends the reach. There are other free goodies too, including mentions in our weekly newsletter
[00:59:52.320 --> 00:59:58.800]   that sent to thousands of fans, engaged fans who really want to see this stuff. We give you bonus ads
[00:59:58.800 --> 01:00:05.200]   and social media promotion too. So if you want to be a long-term partner, introduce your product to a

[01:01:27.040 --> 01:01:35.760]   All right. Back we come to the meat of the matter BNPL. By now,
[01:01:35.760 --> 01:01:41.120]   Paylater Apple announced it was going to do this. Why did it announce that? Like in the fall,
[01:01:41.120 --> 01:01:49.200]   right? A while ago, it's finally launching. It's funny because there is a lot of people saying
[01:01:49.200 --> 01:01:57.120]   BNPL by now Paylater is not consumer friendly. It's not good. Consumers may like it, but it gets
[01:01:57.120 --> 01:02:05.280]   them into financial trouble. The way Apple's doing it maybe is not so dangerous. You can use a service.
[01:02:05.280 --> 01:02:12.560]   It's like six weeks. Yeah, six weeks. It's 50 loans of 50 to a thousand dollars. I presume to buy
[01:02:12.560 --> 01:02:18.960]   Apple product, but then you have four payments over the course of six weeks. That's not exactly
[01:02:18.960 --> 01:02:26.240]   a long term to pay it back with no interest or fees. Yeah, maybe that's how they're hoping to not
[01:02:26.240 --> 01:02:32.160]   be hoodwinking their customers into going underwater. You'd be really, really scared if
[01:02:32.160 --> 01:02:36.560]   you said you have two years to pay. Here's the APR. Yeah. And now you're basically getting people
[01:02:36.560 --> 01:02:42.640]   to pay three thousand dollars for like a phone. Yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly. It's it's I mean,
[01:02:42.640 --> 01:02:47.120]   it would be interesting. It would be an interesting thing if it's like, I know that you're going to
[01:02:47.120 --> 01:02:52.720]   be buying a phone sometime in the next three months. I know that you're in the three months in which
[01:02:52.720 --> 01:02:57.040]   you're saving up for it. We don't want to take the risk that you may buy a different phone or you
[01:02:57.040 --> 01:03:01.840]   might buy a different laptop. So we will let you we will let you buy it now. And then at the point
[01:03:01.840 --> 01:03:07.920]   where you're playing to buy it anyway, you will be able to pay it off. As as usual, I wish I really
[01:03:07.920 --> 01:03:13.760]   knew what Apple's endgame was for for banking. It doesn't seem like if I the only thing the only way
[01:03:13.760 --> 01:03:17.920]   it makes sense for me is if they see this as a way to sell more Macs, sell more hardware,
[01:03:17.920 --> 01:03:21.600]   sell more services, because if they really do want to get into the credit game,
[01:03:21.600 --> 01:03:28.480]   that's a scary place for them to be that's so antithetical to a lot of the historical points
[01:03:28.480 --> 01:03:33.440]   of view that Apple has had. I don't I don't see them being being a money lender. I don't see them
[01:03:33.440 --> 01:03:41.360]   being a rent collector. I don't see them being renting a sofa and then taking it back eight months
[01:03:41.360 --> 01:03:45.600]   later and leaving people on the hook for $5,000 for the payments. It's and those are the things
[01:03:45.600 --> 01:03:51.440]   you sort of associate with these other credit card issuers. So I hope that they don't get I hope
[01:03:51.440 --> 01:03:56.000]   they don't wind up in another air tag situation where it gives them nothing but bad press.
[01:03:56.000 --> 01:04:01.520]   I'm sure Goldman Sachs is underwriting it, right? But yeah, the Verge found a little fine print you
[01:04:01.520 --> 01:04:06.560]   may be interested to hear. According to Apple, users can apply for this loan within the Apple
[01:04:06.560 --> 01:04:12.080]   wallet quote with no impact on their credit end quote. But the company notes in the fine print
[01:04:12.080 --> 01:04:16.400]   that the pay later loan in payment history quote may be reported to credit bureaus and impact their
[01:04:16.400 --> 01:04:23.120]   credit. So yeah, it will impact your credit. I think that they I think that the issue there is
[01:04:23.120 --> 01:04:26.880]   that they said it originally because I think that's probably what they believed. And then what's
[01:04:26.880 --> 01:04:32.720]   happened is that that's you can't do it. That's not how it works or the check doesn't but if you fail
[01:04:32.720 --> 01:04:37.680]   to pay it absolutely does something like that. I don't know. I mean, Andy, I totally see your
[01:04:37.680 --> 01:04:43.360]   point but I feel like what Apple is doing here is actually a different quintessentially Apple thing
[01:04:43.360 --> 01:04:49.360]   which is they're looking at the success of buy now pay later services with certain age groups
[01:04:49.360 --> 01:04:55.760]   and saying, well, we could let somebody else administer that program or we could just do it
[01:04:55.760 --> 01:05:02.160]   ourselves and control it all which is a very Apple thing to do. But I see your point like it is it
[01:05:02.160 --> 01:05:06.720]   is a weird choice to maybe it was one of the easier things for them to do. But Apple doing,
[01:05:06.720 --> 01:05:10.080]   you know, being its own bank and doing all these other things that we've heard rumored.
[01:05:10.080 --> 01:05:15.520]   This is a strange sort of thing to roll out. But you know, then again, I think Apple's found that
[01:05:15.520 --> 01:05:19.520]   it disrupting the financial industry and the banking industry is a lot harder than disrupting
[01:05:19.520 --> 01:05:25.200]   the cell phone industry was because what Apple Pay just launched in South Korea, I think just this
[01:05:25.200 --> 01:05:33.280]   week or this month and that like Apple Pay in South Korea in a major market and yet it's limited
[01:05:33.280 --> 01:05:40.400]   to like one card in South Korea. So there's all sorts of, I don't know, I owe to be a fly on the wall
[01:05:40.400 --> 01:05:47.760]   of the Apple financial team and hear about what they choose to prioritize or what they choose to
[01:05:47.760 --> 01:05:52.320]   launch just because it's the thing that they could manage to get launched with a whole building of
[01:05:52.320 --> 01:05:58.480]   lawyers because financial and banking regulations. Only one? Maybe a couple of buildings.
[01:05:58.480 --> 01:06:03.360]   These are, this is complicated stuff. I know because I watched billions in show time. And I
[01:06:03.360 --> 01:06:07.120]   remember you really wanted to be a bank and all the things. It's called some oddie. Yeah. It's like,
[01:06:07.120 --> 01:06:11.840]   wait a second. Well, I think that this is a really, I mean, I think if you look at, I still think that
[01:06:11.840 --> 01:06:17.040]   if you look at Apple Pay, you know, they let somebody else administer that this is Apple Financial
[01:06:17.040 --> 01:06:20.800]   Services or this is sub, they have their own thing that they're making. I think it's Goldman,
[01:06:20.800 --> 01:06:25.760]   right? Goldman's probably. No. No, no, no. Apple's handling it by its master. Oh, this is their pilot
[01:06:25.760 --> 01:06:31.920]   project. If they're either a bank, it's by a new subsidiary called Apple financing LLC.
[01:06:31.920 --> 01:06:40.080]   Limited liability. Very careful there. So, but I think that the, and Apple has the money to back
[01:06:40.080 --> 01:06:46.480]   this up. They, you know, it'll be interesting to see there's still, Apple is one of the only
[01:06:46.480 --> 01:06:51.040]   companies in the world and it would be very, like, I, is one of the only companies in the world that
[01:06:51.040 --> 01:06:56.480]   can build a closed loop system where they're offering you credit and then, you know, offering
[01:06:56.480 --> 01:07:02.160]   people savings all inside of the same pipeline and they, it just feels like they're sneaking up on it.
[01:07:02.160 --> 01:07:05.360]   You know, like they're just adding one more little thing. Let's figure this out for a little while.
[01:07:05.360 --> 01:07:10.640]   That's one more little thing. This is very slow though, toe in. This is only available iPhones and
[01:07:10.640 --> 01:07:16.960]   iPads and to a random selection of users. But this is, again, this is, this is a very,
[01:07:16.960 --> 01:07:21.920]   it's a very complicated thing. And I think Apple is, I still feel like Apple is, is just kind of
[01:07:21.920 --> 01:07:26.800]   figuring this out slowly because they know how, how dangerous and deep the water is.
[01:07:26.800 --> 01:07:29.920]   But there's a lot of people that are not, you know, there's a lot of people that just don't care
[01:07:29.920 --> 01:07:34.240]   about their bank. Like, you know, and I think that Apple looks at that, like, you know, the banks
[01:07:34.240 --> 01:07:40.080]   do, don't do what they do very well. Apple thinks that it can do it better. It builds a very tight
[01:07:40.080 --> 01:07:46.080]   relationship. And if you look at larger financial things like cars and other things like that,
[01:07:46.080 --> 01:07:51.760]   being able to provide that financing as well as provide savings opportunities to make that all work
[01:07:51.760 --> 01:07:59.040]   is not something like, you know, typically banks can't afford to do that kind of, I mean, banks
[01:07:59.040 --> 01:08:05.920]   we just saw recently, having large deposits are not necessarily the safest thing in the world.
[01:08:05.920 --> 01:08:11.600]   Small-letter deposits are not very profitable. But if you're just cutting out one or two percent of
[01:08:11.600 --> 01:08:15.600]   interest or taking that one or two percent of interest out of it, out of the system,
[01:08:15.600 --> 01:08:19.520]   it could be very profitable for a company like Apple. And they could be billions and billions
[01:08:19.520 --> 01:08:25.120]   in dollars that they get kind of by cutting everybody else out slowly. And so I think that
[01:08:25.120 --> 01:08:30.080]   it still feels like Apple is just kind of, I know it sounds crazy, but it looks like they're
[01:08:30.080 --> 01:08:36.720]   really sneaking up on this horse. So, despite the fact that Apple has a new subsidiary,
[01:08:36.720 --> 01:08:44.560]   the company partnered with the BNPL program MasterCard installments to enable it while,
[01:08:44.560 --> 01:08:48.960]   quote, Goldman Sachs is the issuer of the MasterCard payment credentials.
[01:08:48.960 --> 01:08:55.040]   So it's a little bit of Apple, a little bit of other things as well.
[01:08:55.040 --> 01:08:58.000]   Easiest way to do it. It's the easiest way to dip your toe into that.
[01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:02.720]   Oh, absolutely. I really think there probably is a debate within Apple about, yeah, there's a lot
[01:09:02.720 --> 01:09:08.080]   of profit here, but there's also a lot of risk both reputationally and otherwise.
[01:09:08.080 --> 01:09:15.040]   The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau identified several areas of risk of consumer harm
[01:09:15.040 --> 01:09:21.520]   in BNPL programs, including inconsistent consumer protections, a prevalence of data harvesting,
[01:09:21.520 --> 01:09:27.040]   and a risk of debt accumulation, which of course is always the risk with all of these. By the way,
[01:09:27.040 --> 01:09:33.360]   good job Emma Roth at the verge of her reporting on this, a lot of inside stuff.
[01:09:33.360 --> 01:09:40.800]   This makes me wonder also about the savings account because before 1644 came out, when it was
[01:09:40.800 --> 01:09:48.960]   still in beta, there was a lot of conversation about stuff in the code referring to accounts.
[01:09:48.960 --> 01:09:56.800]   1644 had references to routing and account numbers, current balance, interest earned, data management,
[01:09:56.800 --> 01:10:01.920]   funds available for withdrawal, and more. We didn't have we seen anything in 1644,
[01:10:01.920 --> 01:10:08.320]   the release that indicates Apple's savings is happening imminently or it still hasn't happened,
[01:10:08.320 --> 01:10:13.360]   right? I can't still still don't have that high yield savings account.
[01:10:13.360 --> 01:10:18.400]   I know Alex, you've said for a long time Apple should be a bank.
[01:10:18.400 --> 01:10:21.600]   I'm saying they should. I'm saying they aren't. They're going to.
[01:10:21.600 --> 01:10:26.400]   They're going to. I'm saying that they should. I'm saying that it just I can see
[01:10:26.400 --> 01:10:30.000]   these trajectories and it just wow, it doesn't look like why would you do any of the things you're
[01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:33.840]   doing if you weren't going to become a bank. That's the thing is that so if you weren't going to
[01:10:33.840 --> 01:10:38.800]   become a bank, you wouldn't do any of these things. I'm not saying that Apple should do it.
[01:10:38.800 --> 01:10:43.360]   I'm just saying that they could and they really look like they are five years.
[01:10:43.360 --> 01:10:48.000]   Right now, they're just doing what merchants do. They're not doing well, the savings account would
[01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:53.360]   be what a bank does of course. Yeah. And Apple paid it a degree that you could pay others.
[01:10:53.360 --> 01:10:58.000]   You can't pay bills with it yet, right? I mean, I pay my hairdresser with it.
[01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:02.720]   I pay the same hairdresser with it. Yes, that's right. We have the same hairdresser.
[01:11:02.720 --> 01:11:10.000]   But I keep a bunch of money in Apple Pay all the time because that's kind of my
[01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:16.240]   I can use all the time. I don't have. I have 1,738 in my wallet.
[01:11:16.240 --> 01:11:22.240]   That's because I accumulate one, two, and three percent when I make purchases.
[01:11:23.040 --> 01:11:26.480]   Wow. Transfer some of the back to your bank. I might take that back.
[01:11:26.480 --> 01:11:32.320]   Is it insured? Is it FDIC insured? Is this like being in Silicon Valley Bank?
[01:11:32.320 --> 01:11:42.480]   Yeah. So apparently, the Apple Pay later starts today to, as we said,
[01:11:42.480 --> 01:11:49.840]   they're making offers to select users. Did we mention that that's loans of $50 to $1,000?
[01:11:49.840 --> 01:11:56.720]   So we're really talking about, can't afford the AirPods will help you with that.
[01:11:56.720 --> 01:12:01.120]   Not the best iPhone, but AI phone will help you with that.
[01:12:01.120 --> 01:12:04.800]   Well, I mean, yes. In that case, it's a merchant feature just like layaway, right?
[01:12:04.800 --> 01:12:07.840]   It's something merchants do as a convenience to help sell stuff,
[01:12:07.840 --> 01:12:10.640]   especially since it's not six months, it's six weeks.
[01:12:10.640 --> 01:12:16.880]   So the argument is that Gen Z likes this sort of thing. I'm not sure I buy that argument.
[01:12:16.880 --> 01:12:22.080]   I think the more the argument is Gen Z is young and doesn't have a lot of cash right now and
[01:12:22.080 --> 01:12:28.160]   once those AirPods. And so we can close the deal by splitting the cost over three payments,
[01:12:28.160 --> 01:12:34.160]   two weeks apart or whatever. That's the story here. And it makes me uncomfortable because it
[01:12:34.160 --> 01:12:39.440]   feels actually like it's probably not what it's being sold as, which is a new way to pay that a
[01:12:39.440 --> 01:12:44.160]   new generation likes and probably more the same old story, which is it's a financial instrument
[01:12:44.160 --> 01:12:48.720]   designed to get as much money extracted from 20 something who don't have a big bank account
[01:12:48.720 --> 01:12:52.800]   as possible. And I think a lot of it is that they go for the AirPod Pro instead of the AirPod
[01:12:52.800 --> 01:12:57.280]   because they can figure that out. It's less of like they're taking a big bite, but they're like,
[01:12:57.280 --> 01:13:00.240]   oh, I'll buy something that's 50 dollars more. I can't do that right now, but if I split it up,
[01:13:00.240 --> 01:13:08.560]   I can spread it out. Danger, children danger. I don't, I encourage my kids not to do that,
[01:13:08.560 --> 01:13:15.920]   but as I'm sure most parents do, we just told Michael, you know, he just got his first credit card.
[01:13:15.920 --> 01:13:21.760]   We said, pay it off every month. Don't run a balance. That's a recipe for disaster.
[01:13:21.760 --> 01:13:26.160]   And I know that from personal experience, I mean, I got to a point in my 30s where I had,
[01:13:26.160 --> 01:13:31.360]   I don't know, 20 or $30,000 in credit card debt. At that point, the interest is so high
[01:13:31.360 --> 01:13:35.680]   that you're almost not paying off the credit card. It just goes and goes and goes.
[01:13:37.280 --> 01:13:43.520]   It's not a good thing. Save your pennies, but see, that's what I'm doing now, my Apple wallet.
[01:13:43.520 --> 01:13:47.440]   When I get to $3,000, I can buy the new M3 MacBook Pro.
[01:13:47.440 --> 01:13:55.280]   I just realized I'm saving money. I will say that I don't, I think the cap is,
[01:13:55.280 --> 01:14:00.400]   I think the transfer cap, I believe is about two grand on Apple Pay only because I tried to buy,
[01:14:00.400 --> 01:14:06.320]   I went to buy something from a friend of mine for six grand or five grand and Apple Pay was like,
[01:14:06.320 --> 01:14:11.440]   no, no, no, no, you can't transfer $5,000 of Apple Pay. They were like,
[01:14:11.440 --> 01:14:13.760]   can you transfer that money into your bank account though?
[01:14:13.760 --> 01:14:16.400]   Yeah. They don't, they just, you can't do it.
[01:14:16.400 --> 01:14:19.440]   You can't do it. Out of your bank account into Apple Pay. You can go, you can't send it.
[01:14:19.440 --> 01:14:24.000]   Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. That's what I did because I moved it from my bank account to Apple Pay.
[01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:26.080]   And then I tried to just send him Apple Pay.
[01:14:26.080 --> 01:14:27.200]   You can't just do it in one transaction.
[01:14:27.200 --> 01:14:27.360]   That's the answer.
[01:14:27.360 --> 01:14:28.320]   That's what I was getting.
[01:14:28.320 --> 01:14:31.360]   You have to do, well, Venmo's like that. You have to do a thousand bucks at a time.
[01:14:31.360 --> 01:14:32.640]   Yeah. Yeah.
[01:14:35.680 --> 01:14:43.440]   Oh, at Apple, there's, according to the New York Times, rare descent over a new product.
[01:14:43.440 --> 01:14:47.440]   I think the New York Times is a little late on this, frankly, Tripp Mickle and Brian X Gen.
[01:14:47.440 --> 01:14:51.680]   The company's expected to unveil an augmented reality headset in a few months.
[01:14:51.680 --> 01:14:55.840]   Some employees wonder if the device makes sense for Apple.
[01:14:55.840 --> 01:14:58.640]   Didn't German have this story like three weeks ago?
[01:14:58.640 --> 01:15:01.040]   Financial Times had it last week, I think.
[01:15:01.040 --> 01:15:04.160]   Last week. Okay. So Tripp and Brian are finally
[01:15:05.200 --> 01:15:06.240]   getting around to it.
[01:15:06.240 --> 01:15:11.520]   I think the information about the demo in front of like how you exactly-
[01:15:11.520 --> 01:15:13.440]   The 100 people. Yes. That was German.
[01:15:13.440 --> 01:15:14.720]   Yeah. Yeah. 100 Apple.
[01:15:14.720 --> 01:15:20.640]   Yes. The top 100 Apple executives came to the Steve Jobs Theater last week to see,
[01:15:20.640 --> 01:15:25.920]   not for the first time, but to see this new product, which Apple will presumably be offering
[01:15:25.920 --> 01:15:28.240]   for $3,000 in June.
[01:15:28.240 --> 01:15:30.880]   Yeah.
[01:15:30.880 --> 01:15:36.400]   It's the only scary thing about it was that the description of the video was-
[01:15:36.400 --> 01:15:42.720]   They showed a video that was along the lines of a promo video.
[01:15:42.720 --> 01:15:47.280]   And so the video showed a man in a London taxi donning an augmented reality headset and
[01:15:47.280 --> 01:15:50.720]   calling his wife in San Francisco, "Would you like to come to London?"
[01:15:50.720 --> 01:15:52.880]   He asked two people who saw the video.
[01:15:52.880 --> 01:15:56.000]   Soon the couple were sharing the sites of London through the husband's eyes.
[01:15:56.000 --> 01:15:57.840]   Lord. That is awful.
[01:15:59.040 --> 01:16:02.080]   I will say that I don't- I think that something got convoluted there.
[01:16:02.080 --> 01:16:04.640]   I know that that's what they reported, but that happened
[01:16:04.640 --> 01:16:10.480]   something almost identical like that was reported to have happened in 2018.
[01:16:10.480 --> 01:16:16.320]   Yeah. Like where they didn't even have the device yet and Johnny I was still like pushing this-
[01:16:16.320 --> 01:16:17.920]   You know, and there was a big thing. So I think that-
[01:16:17.920 --> 01:16:21.920]   Oh yeah. In fact, no. The time says this was five years ago.
[01:16:21.920 --> 01:16:26.080]   It says that- Yeah. So when Apple had a corporate retreat in Carmel Valley about five years ago
[01:16:26.080 --> 01:16:33.360]   to discuss the major product Johnny Ive captivated a room with a concept video, that was five years ago.
[01:16:33.360 --> 01:16:37.440]   So that was- I think that was in a different time when they had a different expectation of what
[01:16:37.440 --> 01:16:41.840]   of what they were going to be able to get done in five years. They're not going to get that right
[01:16:41.840 --> 01:16:45.520]   now. You know, and I think that they were trying to create some imagination there.
[01:16:45.520 --> 01:16:52.240]   Well, but also, I mean, as time goes by, I think we're less and less-
[01:16:52.240 --> 01:16:56.400]   Does that sound appealing? Is that a feature you can't wait to get so that you can get in the
[01:16:56.400 --> 01:17:03.200]   tax? There are a lot of features. You know, and I have to admit that I have done a lot of AR and VR
[01:17:03.200 --> 01:17:08.320]   work. You know, and- Yeah, you're our expert. Yeah. So I can tell you that there's a lot of
[01:17:08.320 --> 01:17:12.960]   things that will be really exciting. One of the problems that Oculus had, and you know, we were
[01:17:12.960 --> 01:17:19.200]   part of the training team for the Oculus camera. So we were- so I definitely know a lot about
[01:17:19.200 --> 01:17:25.520]   the capture and the process and everything else. And the- one of the real challenges with Oculus
[01:17:25.520 --> 01:17:30.880]   in general was the frame rate wasn't high enough to be compelling. And the development process was
[01:17:30.880 --> 01:17:36.160]   really hard. And the video acquisition was very hard. And so everything was hard to create content
[01:17:36.160 --> 01:17:39.760]   for it. It- it- it's still- I mean, I don't know if it's- as much anymore. I haven't done it for
[01:17:39.760 --> 01:17:47.040]   Oculus for a while. But the- the content development process was very difficult. The frame rate was
[01:17:47.040 --> 01:17:52.640]   too low. The resolution was too low. And they burned up all the people that were really excited about
[01:17:52.640 --> 01:17:58.560]   it with something that just really wasn't there. It was like 320 by 240 video. Now what I can say
[01:17:58.560 --> 01:18:02.960]   is that when you- well, a lot of- there are headsets that, you know, haven't been released
[01:18:02.960 --> 01:18:08.960]   that have much higher frame rate and much higher resolution. And you know, you can't gauge what
[01:18:08.960 --> 01:18:13.200]   the success of the current one is without seeing the ones- I don't- and I don't know what Apple's
[01:18:13.200 --> 01:18:20.640]   gonna do. But without- but with- if the frame rate is over 95 frames a second, let's just say 120
[01:18:20.640 --> 01:18:27.760]   frames per second. And if the- if the video is 6K per i or more, it's a much different experience
[01:18:27.760 --> 01:18:33.280]   than anything- anything people have seen up until now. And so if Apple's able to- to do that,
[01:18:33.280 --> 01:18:37.440]   it's gonna be a really interesting thing. The other real problem has been development.
[01:18:37.440 --> 01:18:41.440]   And Apple's been building up all the USDZ and all the AR tools and all the ISO. Because it was
[01:18:41.440 --> 01:18:45.680]   really- it was only a handful of us were doing it very well when it came to like live interaction
[01:18:45.680 --> 01:18:51.760]   with Oculus because it was really a heavy lift in unity or in unreal and you're building these
[01:18:51.760 --> 01:18:55.440]   things out and it's not- it's not trivial to put those things together. And so I think that that
[01:18:55.440 --> 01:19:02.080]   was a real- there was a- just not- they built a huge canal with no water. You know, and so- so I
[01:19:02.080 --> 01:19:06.320]   think that that- there are a lot of challenges. And the biggest thing with Oculus was- not the
[01:19:06.320 --> 01:19:11.040]   biggest thing, but one of the big things is configuration when you put the headset on is really important.
[01:19:11.440 --> 01:19:16.160]   When you put it on, it has to do something and you have to understand where you're going. And
[01:19:16.160 --> 01:19:19.760]   a lot of people had a problem with that. You put it on and now you're in some state and you're
[01:19:19.760 --> 01:19:24.160]   trying to figure out how to explain it to somebody or how to do X, Y, and Z. One of the advantages
[01:19:24.160 --> 01:19:27.600]   that Apple has is that they have a phone that can connect to it. They have an Apple TV that
[01:19:27.600 --> 01:19:31.920]   can connect to it. They have a lot of things that can say you're in a state at your Apple TV.
[01:19:31.920 --> 01:19:36.560]   Let's say you're watching MLS. Would you like to stand next to the goal for this next little bit?
[01:19:36.560 --> 01:19:42.160]   Throw your headset on and boom, you're there. You know, and I think that- and they can do that
[01:19:42.160 --> 01:19:46.160]   because they're the broadcaster for MLS. They can tell them- they can put cameras wherever they
[01:19:46.160 --> 01:19:49.760]   want. They don't have to negotiate with anybody. They don't have to- they're going to say, "We're
[01:19:49.760 --> 01:19:52.880]   going to put a camera here and here and here and we're going to be able to give you that." But
[01:19:52.880 --> 01:19:56.880]   it's not- people always like, "Well, how are you going to do that for hours? You're not going-
[01:19:56.880 --> 01:20:01.360]   maybe it's 15 minutes. Maybe it's a minute. Maybe it's three minutes. I'm going to have a
[01:20:01.360 --> 01:20:06.800]   bigger experience in that moment." And I think that there's a lot of places that-
[01:20:06.800 --> 01:20:12.240]   you know, when we were doing a lot of the stuff that we- that I've worked on hasn't made it to
[01:20:12.240 --> 01:20:14.880]   the public, but I can tell you, there were a lot of things that we were like, "Oh, this is what we
[01:20:14.880 --> 01:20:19.440]   would do this all the time." It was just expensive and hard to do and it wasn't ready for prime time
[01:20:19.440 --> 01:20:25.840]   because the technology wasn't fast enough to do it. But I think that there's a lot- I mean,
[01:20:25.840 --> 01:20:29.840]   when people say there's no- there's no solution or there's nothing people want to do what they are,
[01:20:30.720 --> 01:20:37.040]   we've only seen very, very small and rough versions of what's there. I think that- I think there's a
[01:20:37.040 --> 01:20:40.560]   lot of really interesting things that people are really going to be interested in to play with
[01:20:40.560 --> 01:20:44.640]   as that rolls out. And I think that the biggest mistake Apple will make if they don't do- if they
[01:20:44.640 --> 01:20:50.560]   don't execute it is funding development of content. Like they have to go full out, they blew it with
[01:20:50.560 --> 01:20:55.680]   books. You know, books they went to Pearson and gave them money to do something stupid.
[01:20:56.560 --> 01:21:01.920]   And it was completely a disaster. And they didn't build the tools that were necessary for books to
[01:21:01.920 --> 01:21:06.400]   be successful. Like they could have designed something that was way beyond books and not what
[01:21:06.400 --> 01:21:14.240]   they got. So if they can- if they develop- if they really fund, you know, I think that Unreal has
[01:21:14.240 --> 01:21:20.160]   done- I mean, Epic has done an amazing job with their- their- what do they call it- megafund.
[01:21:20.160 --> 01:21:24.320]   I mean, it got everyone stopped thinking about anything else and started developing for megafunds
[01:21:24.320 --> 01:21:28.800]   because they- because they could get 25- 25,000 dollars almost, you know, and all those are grants.
[01:21:28.800 --> 01:21:34.000]   They're not investments. They can get 25,000, 250,000, 500,000, a million dollars. And people are
[01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:39.360]   developing all the time for it. And so I think that Apple really- I- I- I think we should be careful
[01:21:39.360 --> 01:21:42.800]   in saying that Apple- that there's no market here. I think there's a pretty big market here.
[01:21:42.800 --> 01:21:47.760]   I think that at $3,000, it's going to be a very small market to start with. But Apple has to get
[01:21:47.760 --> 01:21:53.760]   user-in- they have to get user feedback before they go any further. They can't keep developing this
[01:21:53.760 --> 01:21:59.200]   in a lab with like 10 people using it. They have to get it out there. They have to, you know,
[01:21:59.200 --> 01:22:03.920]   take some scrapes. They have to like figure it out. And they have- and I think it's just smart to
[01:22:03.920 --> 01:22:09.040]   actually charge a lot for it so that you can have the performance that is inspiring. And you're not
[01:22:09.040 --> 01:22:12.720]   dealing with just average people putting it on and going, "I'll understand." You know, it's- it's
[01:22:12.720 --> 01:22:17.760]   people who are investing real money in it and getting performance that they- you just can't put
[01:22:17.760 --> 01:22:21.600]   into a thousand-dollar headset. So I think it's going to be interesting. I think it's going to-
[01:22:21.600 --> 01:22:26.720]   you're the bull. I'm the bear. I think this is such a waste of time and money for Apple.
[01:22:26.720 --> 01:22:32.480]   What's interesting is apparently Mark German's turning into a little bit of a bear. He says,
[01:22:32.480 --> 01:22:37.840]   "With the headset, Apple will have to explain to consumers why they'd want to own such a product
[01:22:37.840 --> 01:22:44.640]   at all. Moreover, the device will start around $3,000, lack a clear killer app, require an external
[01:22:44.640 --> 01:22:49.040]   battery that will need to be replaced every couple of hours, and use a design that some testers
[01:22:49.040 --> 01:22:53.680]   have deemed uncomfortable. It's also likely the launch would limit me a content."
[01:22:53.680 --> 01:22:59.200]   Show me the lie, right? I mean, he's not wrong. Although the killer app thing is weird because very
[01:22:59.200 --> 01:23:04.560]   rarely does a new hardware product launch with a killer app. You launch it and then the world
[01:23:04.560 --> 01:23:10.720]   provides a killer app or doesn't. And you kind of hope you build a product that will be able to
[01:23:10.720 --> 01:23:17.280]   enable a killer app. But other than that, he's not wrong. I don't- I always think of Mark German as
[01:23:17.280 --> 01:23:25.840]   the person who has good sources inside Apple but is not being used by Apple to get for its purposes.
[01:23:25.840 --> 01:23:31.200]   Although I know I said a few weeks ago that some of his reporting was doing exactly what Apple wanted,
[01:23:31.200 --> 01:23:36.720]   which is to show that it's being responsible when it's cutting back on costs and not using
[01:23:36.720 --> 01:23:42.080]   attrition and not filling open jobs and all of that. But this one, not just Mark's report, but a
[01:23:42.080 --> 01:23:47.840]   couple of these other reports that I've seen in the last couple of weeks. I find- how should I put
[01:23:47.840 --> 01:23:57.520]   this? Sauspiciously useful to set expectations low for the Apple VR headset. It feels like,
[01:23:57.520 --> 01:24:03.360]   I don't know whether Apple's really behind it in a concerted way or not, but I'm seeing a lot
[01:24:03.360 --> 01:24:08.320]   more reports that are like, "Oh, but it's going to be expensive and it's going to be a slow build like
[01:24:08.320 --> 01:24:14.080]   the Apple Watch." Just to warn you. Just to warn you. And like, that totally serves Apple's purposes
[01:24:14.080 --> 01:24:18.720]   if this product is what we think, right? You don't want the hype cycle to be like, "Oh my god,
[01:24:18.720 --> 01:24:22.240]   it's the next iPhone and everybody's going to buy one when the truth is they don't think they're
[01:24:22.240 --> 01:24:26.080]   going to sell a million and it's going to cost three grand and they're really playing a long game."
[01:24:26.080 --> 01:24:30.800]   So whether the people inside Apple are just saying that to Mark German and he's reflecting it,
[01:24:30.800 --> 01:24:37.520]   or whether there is a more concerted effort on Apple's part to lower expectations, it really has felt
[01:24:37.520 --> 01:24:42.720]   for me in the last couple of weeks, like the expectations are all being suppressed in a lot
[01:24:42.720 --> 01:24:47.360]   of these reports. Like I said, I don't know if Apple's doing that on purpose, but it certainly
[01:24:47.360 --> 01:24:53.040]   serves them well to have everybody not expect this to be the thing that changes the world.
[01:24:53.040 --> 01:24:59.360]   We'll see. My spider sense went off with this latest one where I'm like, "Now wait a second,
[01:24:59.360 --> 01:25:03.200]   how much expectation management is going on here? I wonder."
[01:25:03.200 --> 01:25:08.880]   I do think that the review cycle on this is going to be so completely predictable
[01:25:08.880 --> 01:25:14.000]   where Apple's going to announce this and then for the first week, cover of every virtual magazine
[01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:18.960]   everywhere saying, "Apple, Apple, Apple, oh my god, this is the... but Zuckerberg couldn't,
[01:25:18.960 --> 01:25:24.000]   the next revolution is here. Cycle two, people actually get them and see that it doesn't actually
[01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:29.200]   do anything because now it's more truthful but also more marketable if you're writing a story.
[01:25:29.200 --> 01:25:34.720]   So, Apple's finally fallen on its face. Look how little this thing does for 3000 damn dollars.
[01:25:34.720 --> 01:25:39.120]   And hey, look, we're doing a side-by-side comparison between that and this 800 dollar
[01:25:39.120 --> 01:25:43.280]   Oculus. And look how much better the Oculus is at the exact same tasks. And then people are going
[01:25:43.280 --> 01:25:46.960]   to forget about it for about eight or nine months. And then Apple will come up with the actual thing.
[01:25:46.960 --> 01:25:52.880]   Okay, good. All right, we'll make a note. Put a pin in that and we'll come back in eight months
[01:25:52.880 --> 01:25:57.040]   or 18 months or however long. That said, it's still very speculative.
[01:25:58.080 --> 01:26:00.640]   The product, just like the car, I think, is speculative.
[01:26:00.640 --> 01:26:04.560]   They can afford it. But except the difference is they're releasing it.
[01:26:04.560 --> 01:26:10.560]   So, the car is all under wraps. Now they're releasing it. And I think there is going to be
[01:26:10.560 --> 01:26:15.520]   a drumbeat saying Apple has fallen on its face and Tim Cook, what are you doing? There's going to be
[01:26:15.520 --> 01:26:18.640]   that. You're right. And... Inevitable. It's inevitable.
[01:26:18.640 --> 01:26:26.080]   But I think that I do think that it'll be... And I believe that Apple has probably spent a lot
[01:26:26.080 --> 01:26:32.000]   of time and money on developing proof... Not the killer apps, but apps that are going to really
[01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:36.240]   push the envelope of what the headset can do. I just can't believe that they would do something
[01:26:36.240 --> 01:26:43.440]   for this long without working on that. I do think that there's some tests that if they show it,
[01:26:43.440 --> 01:26:49.920]   like if you took this headset to, I'll say, the Gettysburg battlefield. I've been there a lot.
[01:26:49.920 --> 01:26:55.360]   So I grew up in Pennsylvania. And you go there and you walk up to pick where pickets charge was,
[01:26:55.360 --> 01:26:58.080]   and you put a headset on and you get to see what the battle looked like.
[01:26:58.080 --> 01:27:02.560]   You get to see what the battle looked like. You hear things. People are going past you.
[01:27:02.560 --> 01:27:07.200]   You'll want that for every historical place that you went. And it's not that you leave it on the
[01:27:07.200 --> 01:27:10.960]   whole time. You're not walking around the battlefield with it, but you walk over to a point, a little
[01:27:10.960 --> 01:27:15.280]   point on the ground and you put it on and you feel like you're there. Or if you're at a sporting
[01:27:15.280 --> 01:27:18.640]   event and you feel like you're on the sidelines or you feel like... And again, it's not... I don't
[01:27:18.640 --> 01:27:24.160]   think it needs to be... What we found in most of the work that we did is... Number one app, by the way,
[01:27:24.160 --> 01:27:33.440]   and I don't know. Watching movies is very popular in planes on Oculus. That's the
[01:27:33.440 --> 01:27:37.040]   people just want to put the headset on and forget everybody's there and go watch a movie. So
[01:27:37.040 --> 01:27:44.320]   that's kind of table stakes. But a lot of use cases are five minutes or less. You put them on,
[01:27:44.320 --> 01:27:49.200]   you experience something, you take them off. And I think that the thing is, is that developers
[01:27:49.200 --> 01:27:53.360]   will have to make a decision. But the one thing I will say is thinking the problem with this is
[01:27:53.360 --> 01:27:59.600]   not... It might be some of the development issues. But the really hard part about AR and VR is that
[01:27:59.600 --> 01:28:06.160]   you have to learn how it works. You have to... It takes many, many cycles to learn how to build
[01:28:06.160 --> 01:28:09.680]   content for it. There's all kinds of things you... Everybody does when they first start and you
[01:28:09.680 --> 01:28:17.120]   can't do most of those things over time. And so the developers that get into it early and bet on it,
[01:28:17.120 --> 01:28:21.120]   and if it turns out successful, they'll be the ones that sell for hundreds of millions.
[01:28:21.120 --> 01:28:27.680]   They'll be like... But it'll be... So there's going to be... The first run really makes a difference
[01:28:27.680 --> 01:28:31.840]   because you don't know which way is up when you start developing this content. Now, they'll go
[01:28:31.840 --> 01:28:35.200]   grab a lot of people that have done stuff, Rockulous and so on and so forth. But I think that...
[01:28:35.200 --> 01:28:41.440]   This is really aimed at the developers. This is aimed at developers. This is aimed at industrial.
[01:28:41.440 --> 01:28:45.440]   This is aimed at those things. The people who want to get in early and figure this out and figure
[01:28:45.440 --> 01:28:49.440]   out how to develop for it and figure out how to create cool things. And I think there's a lot of
[01:28:49.440 --> 01:28:54.560]   cool things they can create. And I think that we haven't seen most of them. We've just done
[01:28:54.560 --> 01:28:57.120]   enough tests that I know there's a lot of things that I did that I would totally
[01:28:57.120 --> 01:29:02.000]   use if it was higher frame rate and higher resolution. All right.
[01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:06.720]   As I said, I'm the bear on this one. You're the bull. We'll see who's right
[01:29:06.720 --> 01:29:14.000]   sooner or later, mostly likely later. And that's good. It's a good caution that in
[01:29:15.200 --> 01:29:21.600]   a few months, you will be hearing us laughing, mocking, throwing eggs at the apple.
[01:29:21.600 --> 01:29:26.160]   Be our head sick. Don't believe... What I will say is there's going to be a lot of money floating
[01:29:26.160 --> 01:29:31.360]   around in Sandhill for shovel-ready... If apple releases it, shovel-ready projects
[01:29:31.360 --> 01:29:36.640]   in the Bay Area... If there's anything left after all the AI investments, maybe.
[01:29:36.640 --> 01:29:41.920]   This is the problem is that something came along, all of a sudden, nobody expected.
[01:29:41.920 --> 01:29:44.720]   And everybody's jumped on that bandwagon.
[01:29:44.720 --> 01:29:52.080]   The thing is Microsoft and OpenAI and Google can all point to something that will solve problems
[01:29:52.080 --> 01:30:00.800]   immediately. Like, "Okay, you've got 5,000 emails in your inbox. 100 of them are related to a project
[01:30:00.800 --> 01:30:04.880]   that you've been working on with collaborating with three people on for the past four weeks.
[01:30:04.880 --> 01:30:09.840]   You need to summarize what you've agreed on, what the timetable is. Good luck looking through all
[01:30:09.840 --> 01:30:15.520]   those 5,000 emails." Or you could just simply ask our new Gmail-enabled AI to simply say,
[01:30:15.520 --> 01:30:21.520]   "Find everything about this project, summarize it, and basically produce a summary for it immediately."
[01:30:21.520 --> 01:30:26.480]   That's the... I don't think that means that that's going to be the death of apple by any means.
[01:30:26.480 --> 01:30:33.760]   But it's an interesting time for apple to say, "We've got this thing that trust us. It's awesome.
[01:30:33.760 --> 01:30:39.440]   It's... You can watch movies on it like an iPhone. Not like an iPhone. Better than an iPhone.
[01:30:39.440 --> 01:30:45.040]   Everything about this, better than an iPhone." I mean, the example you just gave, that's not Apple's
[01:30:45.040 --> 01:30:52.560]   market. They don't care. They don't care about that market. The only thing right now that
[01:30:52.560 --> 01:31:01.200]   anybody does VR with is games. They aren't going to have games. They might have monument
[01:31:01.200 --> 01:31:06.400]   valley level games. They're not going to have AAA titles. They're not going to have
[01:31:06.400 --> 01:31:10.800]   games. They're not going to have AAA titles, but they are going to have games, even if they have to
[01:31:10.800 --> 01:31:15.360]   pay people to make games for their platform. They will do it, whether they're there on month one
[01:31:15.360 --> 01:31:20.720]   or whether it takes a while. Anyway, my vote for which of you is right, by the way, in the Great
[01:31:20.720 --> 01:31:25.840]   Bear and Bull discussion is Andy. Andy's right. The hype cycle will happen. I don't know if we'll
[01:31:25.840 --> 01:31:30.480]   know for years whether anybody is right or wrong because this first product is just not going to be
[01:31:30.480 --> 01:31:34.480]   one worth judging because it's going to be a developer kit, essentially. So we're really not
[01:31:34.480 --> 01:31:41.040]   going to know what regular people are not going to buy a $3,000 thing. So it's like step zero,
[01:31:41.040 --> 01:31:45.200]   square zero. We're not at square one yet. That probably won't be for another year or two.
[01:31:45.200 --> 01:31:48.240]   Yeah. And that's one of the things German said is it's going to be like the Apple Watch,
[01:31:48.240 --> 01:31:53.680]   which took a while to gain traction. Well, basically, not just to gain traction.
[01:31:53.680 --> 01:31:58.640]   Apple, as I said before, Apple guessed wrong as to what people would think about this watch.
[01:31:58.640 --> 01:32:04.320]   Basically, everyone, every year told, no, no, no, you gave us a fitness watch. I know
[01:32:04.320 --> 01:32:08.560]   you think you gave us an extension of the iPhone. I know you think you gave us the next step in
[01:32:08.560 --> 01:32:13.040]   mobile computing. What you gave us was a fitness watch. Thank you for the fitness watch. Now,
[01:32:13.040 --> 01:32:17.520]   improve the features of this wonderful fitness watch. And then Apple said, yes, we are geniuses.
[01:32:17.520 --> 01:32:23.360]   We made this wonderful fitness watch. Stay tuned. We'll be improving the fitness watch.
[01:32:23.360 --> 01:32:27.040]   I'm sure this is going to be the same way for the VR set.
[01:32:28.400 --> 01:32:34.880]   Well, I just hope I'm still around when the VR takes off. You can all tell me how
[01:32:34.880 --> 01:32:39.440]   we'll stick one over your head in the home. Leo hits here. It's here.
[01:32:39.440 --> 01:32:46.000]   We're going to get in. Let's do it. Now, of course, it will it will just be a milk carton with
[01:32:46.000 --> 01:32:50.720]   a with a view master inside it. But we know it'll make you happy. You know, it's
[01:32:50.720 --> 01:32:58.320]   Apple's threatening to take action against staff who don't come into the office. This is just
[01:32:58.320 --> 01:33:05.120]   a scrooge light. A lot of companies are doing this. You got to show up. And it's always
[01:33:05.120 --> 01:33:09.920]   management the wants this and workers go, God, I don't want to I don't want to come into the office.
[01:33:09.920 --> 01:33:17.200]   This is from a show we ship for it platformer. They according to ZOE again, it's not, you know,
[01:33:17.200 --> 01:33:24.160]   according to ZOE, Apple is tracking employee attendance via badge records and will give employees
[01:33:24.160 --> 01:33:29.600]   escalating warnings if they don't come in three times a week. And that's the new that's the new
[01:33:29.600 --> 01:33:33.600]   reporting, right? We already heard this last week that they were they were leaning on people and
[01:33:33.600 --> 01:33:38.320]   it's like a part of their, you know, we're saving money and we're making sure that you're following
[01:33:38.320 --> 01:33:43.840]   our rules. But the fact the detail that they're doing badge tracking, I also wonder if maybe the
[01:33:43.840 --> 01:33:48.000]   badge tracking is really not ratting out the employees, but is ratting out the managers,
[01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:53.680]   right? Like their managers are like, wink, wink, don't need to come in. You can you can take
[01:33:53.680 --> 01:33:58.880]   Wednesday at home and I don't mind. And then the badges don't lie, right? And and they're like,
[01:33:58.880 --> 01:34:04.240]   yeah, I wonder about that. That was my immediate what I thought was why I wonder how many wink,
[01:34:04.240 --> 01:34:08.800]   wink, nudge, nudge agreements there are with managers and their employees and that if they're
[01:34:08.800 --> 01:34:15.600]   going to the card reader records, that that strikes me as being Apple trying to root out like the
[01:34:15.600 --> 01:34:22.320]   managers who are not following the policy, not the employees. But here's a petition, apple together
[01:34:22.320 --> 01:34:29.920]   dot org, tell apple, we demand location flexible work. 1,250 people have signed, although anybody
[01:34:29.920 --> 01:34:37.440]   can sign. So I don't know how many of those are actually Apple employees. Yeah. Part of this,
[01:34:37.440 --> 01:34:44.800]   part of this might be that when they built that brand new campus, they basically got some tax
[01:34:44.800 --> 01:34:50.400]   tax breaks, some financial advantages that were tied to commitments to having X number of employees
[01:34:50.400 --> 01:34:54.240]   coming in to use that facility. And if they don't make those targets, they might have to give some
[01:34:54.240 --> 01:34:59.120]   money back or they might lose some advantages. So there's a lot to unpack here with all these
[01:34:59.120 --> 01:35:05.920]   different companies insisting that that that that that employees actually start to work back in
[01:35:05.920 --> 01:35:11.040]   the office. Some of it really is based on teams, but a lot of them is based on commitments that
[01:35:11.040 --> 01:35:14.480]   the company has made that are really, really complicated that they didn't they never never
[01:35:14.480 --> 01:35:19.200]   thought they would have to have to default on just because they they're having trouble getting
[01:35:19.200 --> 01:35:22.720]   their employees to simply come back to work. Good news. I mean, there's a big.
[01:35:22.720 --> 01:35:26.480]   Go ahead. Go ahead. I was just saying that, you know, the ecosystem, you know, there's an
[01:35:26.480 --> 01:35:29.920]   ecosystem around all of these headquarters that has lots of restaurants and lots of other things,
[01:35:29.920 --> 01:35:34.640]   and they're probably, you know, upset that has got, but on the same side, I mean, there's a,
[01:35:34.640 --> 01:35:39.200]   there's a so many things playing against it. It's not just people wanting to work at home. The open
[01:35:39.200 --> 01:35:44.480]   office is an unmitigated disaster, like it's probably the worst architectural idea in or work
[01:35:44.480 --> 01:35:50.480]   management idea in the last century. And, you know, it is it and it's just I don't know how anyone
[01:35:50.480 --> 01:35:54.560]   thinks straight, you know, when they're when they're in that experience. I think that if most
[01:35:54.560 --> 01:35:57.840]   companies just gave up that, hey, we're getting rid of the open office, we're going to give you
[01:35:57.840 --> 01:36:02.720]   little cubes there and let's say eight feet by eight feet by eight feet that are going to have a
[01:36:02.720 --> 01:36:06.720]   virtual, you know, have a have a they're going to have a camera in them. You can jump into the
[01:36:06.720 --> 01:36:10.160]   meetings and everything else because the other thing you have to realize is that when you're there,
[01:36:10.160 --> 01:36:16.480]   you're not just it's not just the the open office. It is the comp that the battle for the conference
[01:36:16.480 --> 01:36:19.840]   rooms. You know, all of these companies have these conference rooms. There's not enough conference
[01:36:19.840 --> 01:36:23.520]   rooms for everybody. So everybody sits there and they're trying to schedule their 30 minutes and
[01:36:23.520 --> 01:36:28.000]   there's people like literally you're one minute over and there's people stacked outside the window,
[01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:32.000]   like waiting for you to get out so they can get into their do theirs. And there's so much stress
[01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:35.040]   that goes on with all of these things are trying to get into the conference room and trying to get
[01:36:35.040 --> 01:36:37.920]   out of the conference room and then trying to think straight when people are talking to you and
[01:36:37.920 --> 01:36:42.320]   all these other things that if they gave people their own little spaces that they don't have to
[01:36:42.320 --> 01:36:47.600]   listen to everybody that they can be they can be in a they can jump in the meetings would be easier
[01:36:47.600 --> 01:36:53.040]   to do securely. Let's say on campus, you could say some of them are only on campus and so that
[01:36:53.040 --> 01:36:57.760]   you're only using the infrastructure internally. It would be easier to do all these conferences
[01:36:57.760 --> 01:37:03.600]   and talk to each other more by not having to walk over to this campus or that campus and try to get
[01:37:03.600 --> 01:37:09.040]   into that this conference room or that conference room. It's it really is a just a you know the way
[01:37:09.040 --> 01:37:13.280]   that these companies have set up their their offices is just a mess. You know in addition to
[01:37:13.280 --> 01:37:21.200]   that you either spend an enormous amount of money on really bad real estate in the Cupertino area.
[01:37:21.200 --> 01:37:26.880]   It's like a million dollars for a shack. I don't even know if it comes with plumbing for a million
[01:37:26.880 --> 01:37:32.800]   dollars and so people can either pay an incredible sum for a really bad house
[01:37:33.520 --> 01:37:39.040]   or they can move out and not have and be two or three hours away and now they have a reasonable
[01:37:39.040 --> 01:37:44.160]   house but getting into the office is no no small thing and it's just so the quality of life for
[01:37:44.160 --> 01:37:48.480]   the employees and they just suddenly realized how good it could be and I think Apple's already
[01:37:48.480 --> 01:37:54.320]   lost a lot. I mean I know people that are no longer working at Apple only because of the travel
[01:37:54.320 --> 01:37:58.800]   policy like literally they were just like no I'm not coming in and they said we have to come in
[01:37:58.800 --> 01:38:02.880]   and they said well I quit you know like you know and I have enough stock to they don't need the
[01:38:02.880 --> 01:38:07.760]   work you know like you know they have plenty of time to do whatever they want to do and that's the
[01:38:07.760 --> 01:38:12.720]   and so I think Apple's already had a brain a bit of a brain drain from some key I mean there's
[01:38:12.720 --> 01:38:16.720]   some teams that I feel like got eviscerated you know by people who just didn't want to come back in.
[01:38:16.720 --> 01:38:24.400]   Good news Piper has been acquired and Apple is now in possession of middle out compression.
[01:38:25.040 --> 01:38:29.520]   Very big story here no I'm just kidding Apple acquired a startup using AI
[01:38:29.520 --> 01:38:37.200]   to compress videos of course it's using AI. Everything's using AI these days. Wave one.
[01:38:37.200 --> 01:38:42.240]   If you wanted to be funded it's using AI. I'm using AI. Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
[01:38:42.240 --> 01:38:46.080]   yeah we got it we got AI I got it I built a whole chat app.
[01:38:46.080 --> 01:38:53.600]   Sure you sure it's got AI. Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah. Wave one's website was shut
[01:38:53.600 --> 01:39:00.960]   down around January because apparently Apple which never says bought them but didn't tell
[01:39:00.960 --> 01:39:06.880]   anybody nor did wave well at one. Oh wait a minute here's a LinkedIn post published a month ago by
[01:39:06.880 --> 01:39:12.560]   the former head of sales and business development and that's why he's former that the company has
[01:39:12.560 --> 01:39:18.720]   now it was founded in 2016 they set out to take the decades old paradigm of video codecs and make
[01:39:18.720 --> 01:39:28.320]   them AI powered back then back then deprioritize shrubbery focus on faces and texts it's that simple.
[01:39:28.320 --> 01:39:35.360]   That's how I mean I love I love the idea here right which is that our traditional codecs are
[01:39:35.360 --> 01:39:41.040]   all based on each pixel every pixel counts every pixel that's exactly yeah and so what if you had
[01:39:41.040 --> 01:39:44.800]   an algorithm because you can't a person would would not be able to do this right it would be
[01:39:44.800 --> 01:39:51.600]   frame by frame but like an AI that can prioritize every single an algorithm anyway that can prioritize
[01:39:51.600 --> 01:39:56.000]   the parts that you look at and not the parts that you don't and then farm out the different
[01:39:56.000 --> 01:40:00.160]   parts at different levels of compression I mean that sounds pretty clever it doesn't just sound
[01:40:00.160 --> 01:40:07.040]   like a buzzword you know it is also a buzzword that probably helps but I like that I mean right this
[01:40:07.040 --> 01:40:12.800]   is this is the part these chatbots we over talk about chatbots and the chatbots chatbots that
[01:40:12.800 --> 01:40:18.320]   hallucinate now they just I was reading Ben Thompson's story about how they they wired it up um the
[01:40:18.320 --> 01:40:23.680]   chatbots up to like Wikipedia and Wolfram Alpha and suddenly they can look at the internet to find
[01:40:23.680 --> 01:40:28.880]   answers guess what the chatbots don't hallucinate so much now it's amazing but in this case you know
[01:40:28.880 --> 01:40:34.480]   before and after before is well we just write an algorithm that very cleverly compresses video
[01:40:34.480 --> 01:40:41.520]   after is we can actually have a system identify the contents of every frame prioritize what we
[01:40:41.520 --> 01:40:47.760]   you know do heavy compression on what we do lighter compression on and then and use that and like
[01:40:47.760 --> 01:40:52.960]   that's better presumably in the long run but it's not something a human could ever do because
[01:40:52.960 --> 01:40:57.360]   that would be a terrible job to look at every frame and prioritize it although I don't know Alex
[01:40:57.360 --> 01:41:01.680]   may have people who do content aware compression it makes sense it makes a lot of sense yeah it's
[01:41:01.680 --> 01:41:05.360]   cool yeah no it does make sense because right now it's really brightness and contrast and stuff
[01:41:05.360 --> 01:41:09.520]   like that it's like oh it's not looking for a phase it's looking for something that's brighter and it's
[01:41:09.520 --> 01:41:14.800]   in the background in so dark areas get beat up a little bit and light area but if but
[01:41:14.800 --> 01:41:18.640]   absolutely if you can say I'm gonna follow all the people and make sure that they're all sharp
[01:41:18.640 --> 01:41:22.400]   and I'm gonna let everything else and you can get smart about how you do it so it's blurred out
[01:41:22.400 --> 01:41:27.760]   rather than just chunky and so there's a lot of things that it it could do um that that are
[01:41:27.760 --> 01:41:34.000]   pretty interesting and it really makes a difference for VR so uh because we're sending so much data
[01:41:34.000 --> 01:41:38.800]   so it's one thing to get your 1080p stream on youtube to your phone it's another thing to send
[01:41:38.800 --> 01:41:49.360]   you to 6k or 8k 120 frames per second streams to your headset is enormously bandwidth intensive
[01:41:49.360 --> 01:41:54.560]   it'll you know so that's the other the other piece of that is getting smart about that as a big deal
[01:41:54.560 --> 01:41:59.200]   yeah a lot of what's what's kind of interesting about it is and I'm sure you have more direct
[01:41:59.200 --> 01:42:04.160]   experience with us than I do Alex but the idea of okay well what if the what if it's not quite
[01:42:04.160 --> 01:42:09.040]   so much of a bottleneck because we can just as effectively upscale something that is within the
[01:42:09.040 --> 01:42:16.800]   bandwidth limits to using AI to a convincing degree on the device maybe we can up the frame rates
[01:42:16.800 --> 01:42:22.640]   in certain situations so that we don't necessarily have to send 120 frame per second video at 8k we
[01:42:22.640 --> 01:42:30.640]   can actually send 4k 60 or even hd 60 when you look at the machine learning stuff that they're
[01:42:30.640 --> 01:42:36.560]   putting on the chips 100 like you definitely be rebuilding some of those things based on
[01:42:36.560 --> 01:42:40.400]   depending on what they put in the in the headset or what they put on the computers or however they
[01:42:40.400 --> 01:42:44.800]   do it you know that you're right that there's a lot of processing that can be built into the
[01:42:44.800 --> 01:42:49.680]   hardware to solve some of those issues I wonder about the other video i have an Nvidia streaming
[01:42:49.680 --> 01:42:56.000]   box that does exactly that and it's so it's so hard to tell on my 4k just 4k tv i have to lift up
[01:42:56.000 --> 01:43:00.800]   the remote to find out whether i'm looking at actual 4k content or whether it's streaming hd
[01:43:00.800 --> 01:43:05.120]   content and so we upscaling it without my knowing it i'm thinking about the apple silicon story here
[01:43:05.120 --> 01:43:08.960]   too and i know that seems a little bit weird but you know what's the one place i mean there's
[01:43:08.960 --> 01:43:14.400]   there's a compressing video after the fact that there's also capturing video on an iPhone and you
[01:43:14.400 --> 01:43:19.280]   know the iPhone dsp iPhone is already doing analysis of those images and frames as they come in and
[01:43:19.280 --> 01:43:23.680]   using them for all sorts of things this is a face right this is this is shrubbery we nobody can
[01:43:23.680 --> 01:43:30.400]   nobody who will speak for the shrubbery maybe a topia re is what you're really into but but like
[01:43:30.400 --> 01:43:36.960]   right like so you could also i could see them if this is an algorithm that prioritizes when it's
[01:43:36.960 --> 01:43:42.880]   encoding the video you also have that possibility that when you're capturing high resolution video
[01:43:42.880 --> 01:43:48.720]   on an iPhone it's able to take that analysis that's being done and then apply it to the video that's
[01:43:48.720 --> 01:43:54.880]   written to disc so that it's much you know right so it's throwing away more advanced way of throwing
[01:43:54.880 --> 01:43:59.840]   away the shrubbery before it gets onto the disc but it can also be all that stuff that the iPhone is
[01:43:59.840 --> 01:44:04.080]   doing is making it really good at doing making that id and then the headset just takes all the
[01:44:04.080 --> 01:44:08.000]   smarts that they figured out with the iPhone and just applies it to every video coming in you know
[01:44:08.000 --> 01:44:12.880]   just like as it comes in i'm i you know has so much experience doing that now and they've built it up
[01:44:12.880 --> 01:44:18.000]   and it could just process the video as it comes through yeah i don't know if you've been noticing
[01:44:18.000 --> 01:44:20.960]   every time i go to apple tv it seems like they're going to launch another
[01:44:20.960 --> 01:44:26.960]   a new show the story is they plan to spend a billion one billion dollars
[01:44:26.960 --> 01:44:33.760]   to uh on movies on movies on movies tv i think i think this is just movies right yeah this is
[01:44:33.760 --> 01:44:39.680]   just acquiring i guess acquiring their movies from sundance and other uh you know movies and doing
[01:44:39.680 --> 01:44:44.240]   them on theatrical right which is a big thing is that they're going part of the strategy it's
[01:44:44.240 --> 01:44:49.440]   funny how things have changed since a couple years ago now everybody sort of thinks hey you can make
[01:44:49.440 --> 01:44:54.800]   money at theatrical in movie theaters and still make money on your streaming service maybe you
[01:44:54.800 --> 01:45:00.080]   should do both do both yeah with an idea and so that seems to be although i love this there are
[01:45:00.080 --> 01:45:03.520]   some one-offs that they're doing like they they seal the deal with martin square caz by saying
[01:45:03.520 --> 01:45:08.480]   yay yeah marty we'll get you in a theater we promise we promise but like in the long run they need to
[01:45:08.480 --> 01:45:13.200]   find a partner who's a distributor who will find places for their movies in movie theaters yeah they
[01:45:13.200 --> 01:45:17.120]   don't want to do that themselves you really need to find a partner one of these big distributors
[01:45:17.120 --> 01:45:21.520]   who's a big studio and the reports this week are hilarious because they're very much like
[01:45:21.520 --> 01:45:26.720]   apple does not speak the same language as movie distributors too and so all the distributors are
[01:45:26.720 --> 01:45:31.520]   like perplexed they want to cut a deal with apple apple seems to want to cut a deal with them
[01:45:31.520 --> 01:45:36.160]   and yet it's a little like when we were talking about the nfl negotiating with apple where it's like
[01:45:36.160 --> 01:45:41.040]   they just don't speak the same language and i love i can't wait to see what happens but i love
[01:45:41.040 --> 01:45:45.680]   the idea that somebody new encounters apple as a company in their corporate culture and goes
[01:45:45.680 --> 01:45:50.560]   whoa these guys are really different it's like yeah yeah they are they are uh billion is about what
[01:45:50.560 --> 01:45:54.640]   amazon prime is spending although if you think about it it doesn't that's not that many movies
[01:45:54.640 --> 01:46:00.960]   uh they spent 200 million for the new scorsese film with lien arder diCaprio killers of the flower
[01:46:00.960 --> 01:46:07.040]   moon that's gonna so maybe they get five movies but that's a lot of years yeah uh the film uh
[01:46:07.040 --> 01:46:11.600]   will premiere can in may a will cinema release for a few months then apple tv
[01:46:11.600 --> 01:46:17.280]   uh plus other possible candidates according to nine and five mac include the spy thriller
[01:46:17.280 --> 01:46:24.880]   argyle and riddly scott's napoleon so uh if you want to go to water lu with your vr headset yeah
[01:46:24.880 --> 01:46:28.480]   really scott is also one of those deals where they're like yeah redly will get you a theatrical
[01:46:28.480 --> 01:46:32.080]   but it sounds like their long-term strategy is that they're gonna keep doing this right there
[01:46:32.080 --> 01:46:37.600]   one of the film studio basically like a netflix seems to be the only streamer that is committed
[01:46:37.600 --> 01:46:43.360]   to never showing a movie in a theater unless they have to qualify for an oscar that that they just
[01:46:43.360 --> 01:46:47.920]   want to put it on netflix everybody else is having that moment where they realize and part of it is
[01:46:47.920 --> 01:46:55.120]   the marketing marketing a uh movie that's going into theaters is very economical it's expensive but
[01:46:55.120 --> 01:47:01.040]   what it does is it really increases uh perception and awareness of your movie so you do a big marketing
[01:47:01.040 --> 01:47:05.840]   blitz you put it in theaters you make some money it's profitable in theaters probably people still
[01:47:05.840 --> 01:47:10.480]   go to movies in the theaters i haven't been a movie in a theater in three years they do they do and
[01:47:10.480 --> 01:47:16.080]   the numbers are coming back but on top of it all those ads you've run for it in the theater create
[01:47:16.080 --> 01:47:20.640]   that awareness so when it drops on your streaming service people have heard of it like the example
[01:47:20.640 --> 01:47:26.880]   i want to always want to give is that apple had somebody nominated for an oscar for a movie on apple
[01:47:26.880 --> 01:47:32.160]   tv plus and i write about apple for a living and i had literally never heard of that movie and it
[01:47:32.160 --> 01:47:38.480]   was on apple tv plus four months and got an oscar nomination and i never heard of it and that's the
[01:47:38.480 --> 01:47:44.720]   solution at least in part is you put them in theaters you market them when they're in theaters and then
[01:47:44.720 --> 01:47:48.880]   when they come on streaming everybody goes oh yeah that movie and then they might actually watch it
[01:47:48.880 --> 01:47:53.760]   which is better the story originally came from bloomba but not from mark german uh thomas buckley and
[01:47:53.760 --> 01:48:00.480]   lucas shaw uh it's an ambitious effort they say to raise apple's profile in hollywood and lure
[01:48:00.480 --> 01:48:07.520]   subscribers to the streaming service um and yeah it's it's all about theatrical do you think it's
[01:48:07.520 --> 01:48:14.640]   the people like scarsese out of vanity or tradition want to be in theaters and that makes that deal
[01:48:14.640 --> 01:48:21.920]   easier and there's rumors that amazon's looking at amc so like amc is offered a quite a discount
[01:48:21.920 --> 01:48:26.720]   these days i will but so but you know i think that there is this this idea of being part of the
[01:48:26.720 --> 01:48:30.640]   zeitgeist of people going to theaters i don't know if the theaters are necessarily by themselves
[01:48:30.640 --> 01:48:35.200]   there's a in their current structure it's it's it's unclear amazon's got some
[01:48:35.200 --> 01:48:41.840]   great theaters in l.a so they put up they have ones with l.e. that's interesting um that i would
[01:48:41.840 --> 01:48:47.200]   be an opportunity for apple to create a technologically advanced movie theater yeah i mean and that's
[01:48:47.200 --> 01:48:51.200]   what i mean amazon's pushing the embalance the promise you need thousands and apple's talking
[01:48:51.200 --> 01:48:56.640]   thousands of theaters you don't need thousands you apple could i mean they're talking about
[01:48:56.640 --> 01:49:00.160]   i mean they're talking about theaters i don't know if apple when high frame rate movies when um
[01:49:00.160 --> 01:49:08.480]   when um uh uh on lee released uh uh uh billy lee's long half-time walk there were two theaters in
[01:49:08.480 --> 01:49:14.560]   the u.s that could show it at high frame rate too but they were in you know new york and l.a so i guess
[01:49:14.560 --> 01:49:21.040]   well and there's that's okay i mean uh yeah the the um the the other one that was the what was the um
[01:49:21.040 --> 01:49:26.720]   uh the one with bruce willess and uh not bruce will so it was the um was a high frame rateer
[01:49:26.720 --> 01:49:30.640]   it's high frame 120 frame per second and the problem they get into is that there's a
[01:49:30.640 --> 01:49:34.240]   there's some problems with high frame rate and action films you can't watch it at theater you
[01:49:34.240 --> 01:49:40.400]   can't watch it at home you have to have a special place to see it well that's uh yeah i mean
[01:49:40.400 --> 01:49:48.560]   oh yeah my vr my vr yeah i mean uh you could see anybody who went to see to i max or whatever
[01:49:48.560 --> 01:49:54.000]   or doleby to see the 48 frame version you know where you see 48 frames underwater and then you
[01:49:54.000 --> 01:49:59.600]   see 24 above suddenly they were like what happened why was the film all broken when it was they were
[01:49:59.600 --> 01:50:04.000]   above they're above water i was like because it's always been that way that's always you know like
[01:50:04.000 --> 01:50:09.200]   that's it's just that you never got to see both of them next to each other before and so suddenly 48
[01:50:09.200 --> 01:50:15.520]   looked amazing and so but 48 works well um going much over that you know when you get up into the
[01:50:15.520 --> 01:50:21.440]   over the 90 about 95 frames a second it gets to be you start getting people a higher number of
[01:50:21.440 --> 01:50:27.200]   people start getting c-sick because their brain is not able to process it as a as a video so the
[01:50:27.200 --> 01:50:32.240]   so the um but i think that apple to go back to what apple's doing here you don't need that many
[01:50:32.240 --> 01:50:35.920]   theaters you're doing it to get you know going back out the theaters you don't have to do a
[01:50:35.920 --> 01:50:43.840]   major release this is kind of insane one thousand theaters yeah yeah i i think part of it is that
[01:50:43.840 --> 01:50:48.640]   remember that you're talking about brad pit you're talking about uh martin scursese and lee lee
[01:50:48.640 --> 01:50:54.720]   and rr decaprio these people are used to getting financial deals where they get dollar dollar for
[01:50:54.720 --> 01:51:00.400]   dollar or based on uh box office receipts at point it's kind of hard and and they're and also equally
[01:51:00.400 --> 01:51:07.200]   their accountants understand how move uh movie studio accountants are going to try to screw
[01:51:07.200 --> 01:51:12.160]   their clients over in a theatrical release they don't yet understand how they're they get screwed
[01:51:12.160 --> 01:51:17.280]   over via direct video release so i think that even if it's just even if it's just about
[01:51:17.280 --> 01:51:24.560]   standing to the u.s. plus plus plus the international release that's enough to get lienar decaprio
[01:51:24.560 --> 01:51:29.200]   that four forty million dollar fifty million dollar payday by the time the all the day is done
[01:51:29.200 --> 01:51:32.640]   yeah remember that was a big controversy about getting paid that's right yeah
[01:51:32.640 --> 01:51:38.160]   well to your point though i think that they would rather buy an entire theater chain and
[01:51:38.160 --> 01:51:43.600]   give people the you know their percentage of the box office then give them the the stats on their
[01:51:43.600 --> 01:51:48.320]   say on their play outs right on the street so like those are they tell nobody i remember Ben
[01:51:48.320 --> 01:51:52.400]   stiller said that i never knew how many people watched severance we we couldn't get that information
[01:51:52.400 --> 01:51:58.560]   out of them remember scarlet's their hands in su disney because they all her her her her
[01:51:58.560 --> 01:52:02.800]   payout was based on the idea of having a huge tentpole release marvel movie and they'd say
[01:52:02.800 --> 01:52:06.400]   you know what we'll just toss it on disney plus and thank you for the scribe to scarlet like
[01:52:06.400 --> 01:52:13.120]   no no no no yeah get out the checkbook she won i think yeah luchus and buckley uh i'm sorry luchus
[01:52:13.120 --> 01:52:20.400]   shaw and uh thomas buckley writing in bloomberg uh say that uh while apple uh still hasn't figured
[01:52:20.400 --> 01:52:24.960]   out how it will distribute these movies and theaters the company doesn't have the expertise
[01:52:24.960 --> 01:52:29.440]   internally to release movies and thousands of cinemas worldwide at once which is why it's
[01:52:29.440 --> 01:52:34.800]   approached third party distributors the scorsese movies owned by paramount uh so they paramount
[01:52:34.800 --> 01:52:39.760]   will release it in theaters and they will get a 10 percent distribution fee but it's not clear what
[01:52:39.760 --> 01:52:47.600]   apple plans with future uh titles coda which apple won a bah Oscar as best picture for 2021
[01:52:48.240 --> 01:52:54.320]   they paid 25 million for it at sundance they earned two less than two million at the box office of
[01:52:54.320 --> 01:53:01.280]   course that was in the height of covid uh so yeah i mean this is it's complicated and movies are
[01:53:01.280 --> 01:53:07.760]   you know kind of up in the air right now anyway because of covid and and so it's it's and it'll
[01:53:07.760 --> 01:53:13.360]   be interesting to see it nevertheless i have to say apple's releasing so many new i don't know if
[01:53:13.360 --> 01:53:19.600]   you've noticed this on apple tv but there's a lot of apple originals and this is still the the bulk
[01:53:19.600 --> 01:53:25.840]   of their investment in tv coming i'm actually producing tetris looks great that comes out
[01:53:25.840 --> 01:53:32.720]   friday with taren agrit agritin as uh it's the story of and i interviewed uh him uh when uh the
[01:53:32.720 --> 01:53:40.720]   original author uh who uh pajitnov elects a pajitnov who wrote it in the soviet union i
[01:53:40.720 --> 01:53:45.600]   interviewed him because eventually came to the u.s and i said how much did you get paid for uh
[01:53:45.600 --> 01:53:50.080]   for releasing tetris to the world he said they gave me new pc
[01:53:50.080 --> 01:53:57.200]   that's all i got is a high-end uh personal computer which at that time was probably at 286
[01:53:57.200 --> 01:54:04.720]   uh 80 column card upper and lower against unbelievable he was so good uh cg graphics i doubt
[01:54:04.720 --> 01:54:08.640]   elixir pajitnov made the billions of dollars he deserves for one of the most successful games
[01:54:08.640 --> 01:54:13.360]   of all time but uh yeah i can't wait to watch that movie there's a new jennifer gardener movie
[01:54:13.360 --> 01:54:20.160]   there's ghosted there's the big door price silo schmigadoon is coming back prehistoric planet
[01:54:20.160 --> 01:54:27.440]   is coming back there's hi jack there's silo is is based on wool by hu haoi which was a real cult
[01:54:27.440 --> 01:54:33.200]   uh hit as a originally self-published on amazon became a hit eventually he got a publishing deal
[01:54:33.200 --> 01:54:38.400]   and now he's got a tv show so pretty sweet doing another season of the show nobody watched foundation
[01:54:39.200 --> 01:54:44.320]   uh you watched that yeah dirty little secret about apple i thought it was okay not great but
[01:54:44.320 --> 01:54:47.520]   okay but the dirty little secret about a lot of these apple projects and a lot of streaming
[01:54:47.520 --> 01:54:52.720]   projects is there's a wink wink nudge nudge order that is not one year they announce a year because
[01:54:52.720 --> 01:54:58.320]   that allows them to then announce a renewal but i get the strong impression that foundation was
[01:54:58.320 --> 01:55:03.200]   probably gonna get that they had a two-year contract for that if if they didn't announce it
[01:55:03.200 --> 01:55:07.840]   they might have even announced it initially but there are a lot of those that happen like
[01:55:07.840 --> 01:55:12.080]   yeah that that happens a lot now where there's the secret like oh they're already doing it
[01:55:12.080 --> 01:55:17.280]   a lot of times these renewal announcements are uh they're just pr like the contract's
[01:55:17.280 --> 01:55:23.760]   already signed it's just pr that dune which was only half the novel didn't have a green light for
[01:55:23.760 --> 01:55:29.600]   part two yeah until it became a huge hit and then they rushed it into production i guess and we're
[01:55:29.600 --> 01:55:35.120]   gonna finally see it later this year just killed me just killed me yeah anyway uh apple i you know
[01:55:35.120 --> 01:55:40.480]   i had i mocked apple tv plus for a long time but now it's really especially if you buy apple one
[01:55:40.480 --> 01:55:45.280]   which probably a lot of people do it's just it's a no-brainer you get the apple music you get the
[01:55:45.280 --> 01:55:50.080]   apple tv plus you get all this stuff yeah shrinking is one of my favorite things i've seen you know
[01:55:50.080 --> 01:55:56.000]   i've heard great things and i am glad we kind of waited till the uh season is now all out uh we
[01:55:56.000 --> 01:56:02.080]   finally forced ourselves to watch the rest of servant which is a good but weird show and i can't
[01:56:02.080 --> 01:56:06.640]   wait to see severance coming back that'll be oh yeah that'll be huge and of course toad lasso
[01:56:06.640 --> 01:56:12.400]   you know is it as the third season been good is it uh yeah it's it's it's good it's just getting
[01:56:12.400 --> 01:56:15.680]   started though right like they they have their themes and they're gonna make you watch all 12
[01:56:15.680 --> 01:56:20.640]   episodes to get the themes i didn't we we uh haven't mentioned baseball but it is baseball week and
[01:56:20.640 --> 01:56:26.240]   so baseball is uh starting and it's starting on apple tv plus two and the the big news
[01:56:26.240 --> 01:56:31.360]   this time is one one you they're not gonna give it away for free anymore you gotta be a
[01:56:31.360 --> 01:56:34.160]   p plus subscriber last year they gave it away for free but two
[01:56:34.160 --> 01:56:38.560]   biggest complaint we talked about the here biggest complaint everybody had yes they're fans of their
[01:56:38.560 --> 01:56:43.120]   local radio announcers their local tv announcers they don't want to hear the national announcer that apple
[01:56:43.120 --> 01:56:49.920]   is supplying so they announced earlier this or late last week they announced yes you can turn it
[01:56:49.920 --> 01:56:57.040]   to your local broadcasters audio while you're watching so you can tune out their national
[01:56:57.040 --> 01:57:01.760]   and lb network announcers and just put on your local radio unless you're a fan of the texas rangers
[01:57:01.760 --> 01:57:06.080]   this is only in the u.s where if you're a fan of the texas rangers and they're on the road you
[01:57:06.080 --> 01:57:11.040]   can't hear your radio guys i don't know why it's a mystery but otherwise uh and then in canada
[01:57:11.040 --> 01:57:16.560]   they're doing something a little bit different where um the blue j's radio will be on but only the
[01:57:16.560 --> 01:57:23.360]   blue j's radio in canada will be an option um but still it's they totally heard people's complaints
[01:57:23.360 --> 01:57:28.560]   about their beloved home team announcers and they they did what they should do because it's a pure
[01:57:28.560 --> 01:57:33.280]   digital product is add some audio overlays so there'll be multiple audio overlays for those
[01:57:33.280 --> 01:57:39.760]   base paintings that's not super hard it's not super hard it's good factually hard that's what's
[01:57:39.760 --> 01:57:42.560]   actually hard that's what's hard technically hard that's what we saw but i'm from a technical
[01:57:42.560 --> 01:57:46.400]   yeah it's like send us a fee we put another another stream in the atchles and add it to the
[01:57:46.400 --> 01:57:50.560]   manifest and i'd say the only thing that's technically hard about it is that you've got to make sure
[01:57:50.560 --> 01:57:55.360]   that in your pipeline you're getting the audio and the video to be roughly the same time you need to
[01:57:55.360 --> 01:58:00.480]   probably have it happen at the ball park because you you know if they're if they're like eight seconds
[01:58:00.480 --> 01:58:05.520]   out of sync it's a disaster but we'll see how they do the crack of the bat has to be audible at the
[01:58:05.520 --> 01:58:10.480]   same time as it actually hits the ball or it's really disconcerting you know you don't want to
[01:58:10.480 --> 01:58:15.360]   see the guy go and then here it's so good you know the sum Alex probably knows about this but some
[01:58:15.360 --> 01:58:22.480]   some tv broadcast of sports cheat they actually put the announcer audio slightly ahead of the video
[01:58:22.480 --> 01:58:27.600]   there's a delay in that and that allows them to seem like they're calling it as it happens
[01:58:27.600 --> 01:58:32.480]   even though and and the giveaway is baseball which is sometimes you can hear the crack of a bat on
[01:58:32.480 --> 01:58:37.840]   the announcer mic before you hear it or see it and usually usually when the it's when they're
[01:58:37.840 --> 01:58:43.600]   wearing the headsets are using the really um you know directional mics you won't hear anything of that
[01:58:44.560 --> 01:58:49.120]   and it's usually they're they're usually pretty careful about it because usually your FX mics are
[01:58:49.120 --> 01:58:54.000]   are are on the field they're getting the best sound I mean on just a simple basketball game it's
[01:58:54.000 --> 01:58:59.840]   like 27 mics it's different for baseball because it's old fashioned the the radio guys drop them
[01:58:59.840 --> 01:59:05.440]   I know this because I used to work at KMBR they drop a microphone out the booth it just sits there
[01:59:05.440 --> 01:59:11.520]   swinging and of course the fans immediately discover it and start yelling you're a jerk yep
[01:59:12.160 --> 01:59:19.360]   lassick i don't like it green wall there were there was a game when I was in high school that I
[01:59:19.360 --> 01:59:24.240]   was listening to was Ron fairly was the announcer oh i hate it right fairly and he made he was terrible
[01:59:24.240 --> 01:59:28.880]   he made three mistakes in the course of one of that and then and it was candlestick park so there
[01:59:28.880 --> 01:59:34.320]   was nobody there and then there was silence and then you heard from below you're making a fool of
[01:59:34.320 --> 01:59:43.600]   yourself fairly i used to listen just for that amazing oh those are the days you know people would
[01:59:43.600 --> 01:59:48.640]   complain less about it if if the if the national announcer was good i think well that's right the
[01:59:48.640 --> 01:59:54.720]   baseball announcer's were terrible it's but it's it was terrible and and even but i will say to be fair
[01:59:54.720 --> 02:00:01.840]   announcing sports is really hardly skilled like it is it is such a skill and there's you know even
[02:00:01.840 --> 02:00:06.240]   in football like you watch national football and there's all these games and they have to cover
[02:00:06.240 --> 02:00:11.280]   you know at whatever 13 14 games at a time and and everything else and those guys spend the entire
[02:00:11.280 --> 02:00:16.320]   week absorbing all of the information that they that they have to be available for and then a lot
[02:00:16.320 --> 02:00:21.600]   of it's just based on their experience and even then there's like four that are good like you know
[02:00:21.600 --> 02:00:26.960]   out of all of those those announcers maybe six and and then it falls off and they're doing the best
[02:00:26.960 --> 02:00:31.760]   they can to try to fill that in you know and and so i think that yeah it is what apple i mean i we
[02:00:31.760 --> 02:00:36.400]   complain about i complained about it a lot but i will say that for announcing is so it's so much
[02:00:36.400 --> 02:00:40.560]   stuff in real time that's coming into you that you have in baseball's a little easier because it's not
[02:00:40.560 --> 02:00:46.400]   quite as fast but there's still so much in real time that's coming in that you have to um you just
[02:00:46.400 --> 02:00:50.880]   have to know it all and it's really really hard to find those people and i think apple missed it but
[02:00:50.880 --> 02:00:55.440]   it's not like they missed a a slow ball they missed a fastball that is just hard to hit
[02:00:55.440 --> 02:01:02.080]   i think i would say yeah i i think you're harder on the announces than i am there are very few
[02:01:02.080 --> 02:01:07.920]   national announcers who i would consider to like even the ESPN yeah even the ESPN Sunday night uh
[02:01:07.920 --> 02:01:12.880]   broadcast is not very good they're they're most of the good announcers are announcing for local teams
[02:01:12.880 --> 02:01:18.400]   which is as it should be but yeah they're they're super even if i give it to you i mean like they're
[02:01:18.400 --> 02:01:22.960]   super generic and if you're watching a team you don't care about then i think you don't care
[02:01:22.960 --> 02:01:27.840]   but if it's a team you care about you want to hear your people who understand your team and
[02:01:27.840 --> 02:01:31.200]   are and depending on where you live they're either rooting for your team or at least they
[02:01:31.200 --> 02:01:36.160]   understand that you're rooting for your team and i'm glad apple again i think the miracle here is
[02:01:36.160 --> 02:01:42.800]   that apple and mlb worked on this and made the contractual whatever they needed to do to get those
[02:01:42.800 --> 02:01:48.080]   radio broadcasts available on the friday night broadcast because they had to obviously they had
[02:01:48.080 --> 02:01:53.040]   to do something different in terms of rights that's why it's only in the u.s and the one team in
[02:01:53.040 --> 02:01:58.640]   canada and not the rest of the places that apple tv is is showing these games so i'm glad they did
[02:01:58.640 --> 02:02:01.840]   it like they made the effort and that's to make their product better hundred percent that's a good
[02:02:01.840 --> 02:02:08.080]   sign i really wish apple would could do something like twitch for sports where yes yes have the
[02:02:08.080 --> 02:02:14.400]   professional announcers that are basically tied to tied to the broadcast but also create a mechanism
[02:02:14.400 --> 02:02:22.560]   so that if i deem myself an expert on the red socks and i want to take it upon myself to do a
[02:02:22.560 --> 02:02:28.800]   simulcast oh man so that i can basically put my my mug or my living room with four other
[02:02:28.800 --> 02:02:34.800]   friends like in a in a sub window and do my own call of the game be it a serious call be it
[02:02:34.800 --> 02:02:39.760]   mocking everything's going on or be it no i want to basically be the local sports
[02:02:39.760 --> 02:02:44.880]   local sports announcer for boston that has that entire boston perspective with the history
[02:02:44.880 --> 02:02:51.040]   the past president the future and basically some somehow find a way to monetize that
[02:02:51.040 --> 02:02:55.920]   that is something that would be that would make me into a more avid follower of sports
[02:02:55.920 --> 02:03:01.120]   because oftentimes it really isn't like i would love to i would love to watch the nfl some more i
[02:03:01.120 --> 02:03:06.480]   would love to watch the mba some more but a lot of the announcers they really are way more intense
[02:03:06.480 --> 02:03:13.120]   than i can really follow and if i found someone who was sort of like uh sort of like the the
[02:03:13.120 --> 02:03:19.040]   simpleton the knowledgeable simple the knowledgeable expert who speaks down to simpletons like me
[02:03:19.040 --> 02:03:23.920]   i would be watching more mba games and if i could give this person five bucks a month so i could
[02:03:23.920 --> 02:03:28.080]   follow this game i might even spend their five bucks and amazon has experimented with that
[02:03:28.080 --> 02:03:31.440]   amazon has been doing this thing on their thursday night football broadcast where they've got a
[02:03:31.440 --> 02:03:37.040]   couple different play-by-play groups and then they've got like the alt play-by-play audio where
[02:03:37.040 --> 02:03:42.960]   like they had like an improv troupe do it one time and like i love those experiments and it's like
[02:03:42.960 --> 02:03:47.200]   aspian has the manning cast where patan and elin anding make fun of each other and well and the
[02:03:47.200 --> 02:03:51.440]   thing more of that please it's great the thing is that you have to go the exact opposite way the
[02:03:51.440 --> 02:03:56.800]   manning the manning broadcast is the potential of something explosive which is that you have two
[02:03:57.520 --> 02:04:04.000]   you know grade you know level a quarterbacks that i know each other really well and when they
[02:04:04.000 --> 02:04:08.800]   drop into geek mode and they start just talking like watching the game and talking as if they were
[02:04:08.800 --> 02:04:14.080]   if as if they were just honest when they bring in somebody else and they're telling jokes it's
[02:04:14.080 --> 02:04:18.720]   super boring like i just leave it and i think aspian is you know their producers are trying to
[02:04:18.720 --> 02:04:23.520]   make it a show you know but what really makes it great is to these two top quarterbacks sitting
[02:04:23.520 --> 02:04:26.560]   there just talking you see what he's doing there he's doing he's gonna do a curl there and he's
[02:04:26.560 --> 02:04:30.080]   gonna do this and he's gonna and this is what he did there and this is how you look at look at how
[02:04:30.080 --> 02:04:34.160]   he's going through his progressions he's going boom boom boom he missed this one and they start to
[02:04:34.160 --> 02:04:38.720]   just the two of them will riff for like 10 or 15 minutes and it's just gold because now you're
[02:04:38.720 --> 02:04:42.320]   really in it like you're in you're in that you're in the room where it happens kind of thing where
[02:04:42.320 --> 02:04:46.960]   suddenly all those things are there and i think that that that's what you know and again some people
[02:04:46.960 --> 02:04:51.440]   want that some people want hey they're about to do a run play or they just did a run play a run play
[02:04:51.440 --> 02:04:56.640]   is this and you want that basic version of it like i don't understand what this is you know for me
[02:04:56.640 --> 02:05:00.640]   i didn't understand i don't understand i had to do we had a stream like 27 basketball games
[02:05:00.640 --> 02:05:04.560]   and we had all these different commentaries and by the end i understood how basketball worked
[02:05:04.560 --> 02:05:08.560]   you so until before that i was like it's just random people are running back and forth
[02:05:08.560 --> 02:05:14.160]   but we had an ex-player from one of the teams and a social media guy talking about the the
[02:05:14.160 --> 02:05:18.720]   you know going back and forth and answering people's questions live that they were posting
[02:05:18.720 --> 02:05:24.240]   while watching the game and it was super fascinating yeah and it was and it was way better than any
[02:05:24.240 --> 02:05:28.080]   coverage of those games because we could see the other coverage and i was like i'd much rather
[02:05:28.080 --> 02:05:32.240]   watch this and and these and and they were he's like oh look at what they're doing there that's
[02:05:32.240 --> 02:05:35.840]   they shouldn't have gone down that path and and they're just kind of like they're not trying to
[02:05:35.840 --> 02:05:39.120]   impress anybody they're just talking the way that they would talk if they were watching the game
[02:05:39.120 --> 02:05:45.680]   and i think to i think that would be great as many as to Andy's point as many options as possible
[02:05:46.320 --> 02:05:48.880]   you don't think that that we could have to to look at those
[02:05:48.880 --> 02:05:53.760]   get your gentleman get your picks ready we are going to take a little break come back with picks
[02:05:53.760 --> 02:06:02.400]   of the week but first a little plea first before i get into the plea i thank you to our club members

[02:08:00.960 --> 02:08:07.840]   thank you members of club twit for making this all possible uh now time for our picks of the week
[02:08:07.840 --> 02:08:14.160]   jason snell let's kick it off with you uh back in january i talked about a great tool from open
[02:08:14.160 --> 02:08:19.120]   ai not the one you're thinking of it's called whisper and it is an amazing thing that takes
[02:08:19.120 --> 02:08:23.760]   audio and turns it into a text transcript at a quality that is better than anything i've ever
[02:08:23.760 --> 02:08:29.360]   seen um and at the time it was very much like well you can download this thing and compile it and
[02:08:29.360 --> 02:08:35.200]   then figure that out and maybe eventually you'll get to uh way where you can run it well guess what
[02:08:35.200 --> 02:08:42.640]   a very good mac developer named jordy bruin uh created this app called whisper transcription
[02:08:42.640 --> 02:08:47.440]   it's in the mac app store it's free if what you want to use the high quality models there's a
[02:08:47.440 --> 02:08:54.880]   single in-app purchase that you can make um and what he's done is it's a capable mac developer
[02:08:54.880 --> 02:09:03.920]   taking the inscrutable command line command chicanery of whisper and building an entire gooey wrapper
[02:09:03.920 --> 02:09:08.000]   around it and not only did he do the basics like i wrote a shortcut that did that right like it
[02:09:08.000 --> 02:09:13.200]   you could do that part of it but what what this app has done is he's now trying to figure out other
[02:09:13.200 --> 02:09:18.880]   mac like app things he can layer on top of it you can watch as the transcript's going you can
[02:09:18.880 --> 02:09:23.600]   choose after the fact what formats you want to save it as you can choose from any of the models i
[02:09:23.600 --> 02:09:29.520]   have a long-term question about like where is whisper going and is it going to continue to be
[02:09:29.520 --> 02:09:34.240]   updated and is jordy bruin going to you know use a different if there's a different uh
[02:09:34.240 --> 02:09:41.680]   project that i think he's using the c the c model um that that uh i'm also using that's like
[02:09:41.680 --> 02:09:45.600]   the fastest right now but if there's one for neural engine does that get dropped in instead
[02:09:45.600 --> 02:09:49.520]   like there's a lot of questions about it but the beauty of this is now if you don't want to go
[02:09:49.520 --> 02:09:54.320]   into the command line or anything like that but you are curious about having the ability to drag
[02:09:54.320 --> 02:10:00.880]   audio like one of the most popular podcast formats around is uh church podcasts right it's like so
[02:10:00.880 --> 02:10:06.640]   if you're the guy av guy who does your church podcast and you want to do a text a text of a thing that
[02:10:06.640 --> 02:10:11.040]   somebody came up and said that was extemporaneous and there's no script you drag and drop watch it
[02:10:11.040 --> 02:10:15.920]   go by select the text and you've got it and you might not be the kind of person who's going to go
[02:10:15.920 --> 02:10:21.040]   compile that c plus plus code so i think this is a great example that back in the early days of
[02:10:21.040 --> 02:10:26.560]   mac OS 10 we saw this a lot where people were writing gooey wrappers around command line stuff to make
[02:10:26.560 --> 02:10:31.520]   it feel like a mac app and i haven't seen a lot of those lately but this is a good example of that
[02:10:31.520 --> 02:10:37.440]   so i think this is a nice uh right like for regular people on the mac to use whisper which is an
[02:10:37.440 --> 02:10:42.640]   amazing it's like a magic trick i mean you it's worth trying out the free version just to drag
[02:10:42.640 --> 02:10:49.040]   some audio on it and be amazed at how good it is at its job it it really points towards an amazing
[02:10:49.040 --> 02:10:55.120]   future about how we share content and how we understand what's going on around us where you
[02:10:55.120 --> 02:10:58.480]   know we were talking about the fact that you're going to get to a point where you in office hours
[02:10:58.480 --> 02:11:02.000]   we're talking about that you're going to get to a point where there's a a council meeting it's
[02:11:02.000 --> 02:11:06.400]   going to translate it into 60 languages it's going to summarize it in those languages it's going to
[02:11:06.400 --> 02:11:10.560]   put them all into audio with different voices and it's going to put them all out and it's all going
[02:11:10.560 --> 02:11:14.320]   to happen in like a half an hour after the thing happened and everyone can have it and and
[02:11:14.880 --> 02:11:20.160]   being able to have that content just just rolling out of there automatically and this is one
[02:11:20.160 --> 02:11:24.640]   one connection to that but there are just so many places where you want to
[02:11:24.640 --> 02:11:28.960]   do this and it's always been i've done so much transcription and so much captioning and so on
[02:11:28.960 --> 02:11:35.120]   so forth uh i just i totally agree with you um it's just an amazing amazing app it is a must
[02:11:35.120 --> 02:11:41.120]   download it's free must download if you want to get it you i just it's it's really cool and i presume
[02:11:41.120 --> 02:11:45.040]   if you uh we're listening to a podcast like this one that doesn't have a transcript
[02:11:45.040 --> 02:11:50.560]   you could do it yourself right how fast is it is it real time it it depends on how fast your
[02:11:50.560 --> 02:11:55.920]   computer is on my max studio i it is it is like two or three times real time but on a like a
[02:11:55.920 --> 02:12:00.240]   macbook air it might be real time ish and the big thing that it doesn't do i know i mentioned this in
[02:12:00.240 --> 02:12:06.080]   january is the whisper am i model right now doesn't do speaker detection and that is a a next for a
[02:12:06.080 --> 02:12:11.680]   podcast you really want to be able to say uh this who this speaker is even if it's just speaker one
[02:12:11.680 --> 02:12:17.040]   speaker two and right now it doesn't do that because it's an a model sometimes it'll put like a little
[02:12:17.040 --> 02:12:21.200]   line at the beginning that indicates it's a new speaker sometimes it doesn't i've also had it
[02:12:21.200 --> 02:12:26.960]   hallucinate speaker names i did one thing where i did i did a transcript between um me and john
[02:12:26.960 --> 02:12:33.120]   serra qsa and it called us like john and dave i don't know who dave is it decided i was
[02:12:33.120 --> 02:12:38.160]   that would be easy actually that's good if it assigns some name because you could then go
[02:12:38.160 --> 02:12:44.400]   you know do a master place right and if it and right and if it inferred from the text our names
[02:12:44.400 --> 02:12:49.200]   that would be really cool too and that's all coming right like alex said like i want to say
[02:12:49.200 --> 02:12:54.080]   next year but i feel like with ai it's probably next month yeah it'll all be better and and they'll
[02:12:54.080 --> 02:12:58.640]   do all of that too so this is free small fee if you want to use more advanced features whisper
[02:12:58.640 --> 02:13:06.720]   transcription from good snooze alex you know you pick of the week alex i got new camera
[02:13:06.720 --> 02:13:12.240]   and so you did already thinking about it well i'm on the show so i was like well i'll make that
[02:13:12.240 --> 02:13:18.880]   the pick um so i i i sony sent me the fr7 and it was too expensive i can't afford that so but but
[02:13:18.880 --> 02:13:22.960]   what i got hooked on was the fact that i could have an auto the autofocus would work really really
[02:13:22.960 --> 02:13:27.200]   well and i could rock in now and i could do all those things so i couldn't afford the fr7 i
[02:13:27.200 --> 02:13:30.640]   they sent me the fr7 i practiced i had it for a couple weeks and it just ruined me like just it
[02:13:30.640 --> 02:13:34.960]   was the the color rendition and the the sharpness and everything else so people have been already
[02:13:34.960 --> 02:13:40.720]   pinging me on it um well i've been on the show and uh it it's i'm using an fx 30 this is the
[02:13:40.720 --> 02:13:47.040]   less expensive version so it's still still a little pricey but this is an fx 30 with uh i did
[02:13:47.040 --> 02:13:54.160]   get all a 1.4 um f/e lens so 35 millimeter so that can you use it like i have a bunch of sony gm
[02:13:54.160 --> 02:14:00.720]   lenses could i use those yeah yeah it's just it's just a sony sony gm amount uh i you know i will say
[02:14:00.720 --> 02:14:06.400]   that it what happened was is i i the sony one was there and john wallis is in office hours bought a
[02:14:06.400 --> 02:14:11.360]   couple of these for his web you know for his his stuff the same thing i'm doing here and i'm you know
[02:14:11.360 --> 02:14:16.640]   i do this almost professionally i mean i do it do it here professionally but i i'm on i'm on air
[02:14:16.640 --> 02:14:22.000]   you know two or three hours a day so it's worth the investment to are you using it right now is that
[02:14:22.000 --> 02:14:25.440]   what we're looking at right now this is what i'm using right now look i noticed immediately it
[02:14:25.440 --> 02:14:30.720]   looked really good yeah picking up all the great things in your eyebrows it's fantastic exactly
[02:14:30.720 --> 02:14:37.360]   the big thing is is that is that you can you can do this where it it pulls into focus oh my god
[02:14:37.360 --> 02:14:40.960]   that was fast and then you just and then you just come right back out and it just oh it just does
[02:14:40.960 --> 02:14:46.480]   the thing that's nice that's nice and it's the best auto the sony has the best always had the best
[02:14:46.480 --> 02:14:54.560]   auto yeah but it's a so it's a it's a apc sensors that a bad thing super 35 yeah yeah the um uh no i
[02:14:54.560 --> 02:15:00.080]   you know the full frame the fx three is another two thousand dollars and i chose not to go down that
[02:15:00.080 --> 02:15:06.080]   path so so i um so it was if you're shooting 4k video you wouldn't be using the full frame anyway
[02:15:06.080 --> 02:15:10.400]   right you don't need all well i i could the full frame would be nice but this if if my background
[02:15:10.400 --> 02:15:15.360]   got any blurrier than it is already it would be not i like it like okay it's beautiful right it's
[02:15:15.360 --> 02:15:18.400]   good it's a good bokeh but but you want to see some of the stuff back there you don't want to be like
[02:15:18.400 --> 02:15:22.720]   a wash of color maybe some people do but i you know so i thought it was fine i'm gonna take this to
[02:15:22.720 --> 02:15:28.160]   nab and use it as part of my coverage we've got like a ton of nab coverage and so i'm gonna test
[02:15:28.160 --> 02:15:32.880]   it you know probably gonna get another lens that's a zoom lens it's a little um little less and and
[02:15:32.880 --> 02:15:37.520]   take it there and and put it in a cage and shoot you know shoot a bunch of stuff with it how does this
[02:15:37.520 --> 02:15:44.720]   compare with their alpha s's because the uh like the a7s is a those are full frame and more
[02:15:44.720 --> 02:15:50.800]   full frame and their video intended video yeah yeah they they uh i don't know if they i don't think
[02:15:50.800 --> 02:15:56.960]   that they have full frame hd this has a full frame hd my own uh it's nice it's powered by usbc
[02:15:56.960 --> 02:16:05.440]   just really nice yeah as someone's really specifically for cinema it's a cinema with the s as well i mean
[02:16:05.440 --> 02:16:10.480]   this is confusing if i was doing if i was doing quote unquote cinema i'd still be going towards the
[02:16:10.480 --> 02:16:18.080]   fx three fx six yeah i mean fr seven the the this one is a it's a good it's a small a good small it's
[02:16:18.080 --> 02:16:24.560]   a cinema line um it is and again i haven't taken it anywhere handheld or taken it out and it's done
[02:16:24.560 --> 02:16:31.120]   this too they've really bifurcated their lines for cinema and stills uh yeah and it's it's nice and
[02:16:31.120 --> 02:16:37.920]   small it's light um it is again it's got a full full sized hd my it's got usbc i gotta tell you like
[02:16:37.920 --> 02:16:43.840]   black magic has a very specific plug for power and there's a little ptsd that goes on with losing
[02:16:43.840 --> 02:16:48.240]   you know not being able to find the power cable so being able to just grab anything that does
[02:16:48.240 --> 02:16:54.640]   usb-c plug it into the side of the camera it's really nice and the um it is uh so it's it's a great
[02:16:54.640 --> 02:16:59.040]   little camera and again i if i was doing multi-camera like live i'd still use black magic because i can
[02:16:59.040 --> 02:17:03.040]   shade all the cameras separately and i can sync them all together so it's not i don't think it's a
[02:17:03.040 --> 02:17:08.000]   replacement for what i've been doing with black magic cameras but as a as this as what i'm using
[02:17:08.000 --> 02:17:13.520]   it for here potentially some coverage that i'm doing i'm gonna probably keep on using that and
[02:17:13.520 --> 02:17:18.880]   i think we are gonna mix and match some sony cameras at uh nab with the live views that we're
[02:17:18.880 --> 02:17:23.040]   using there so so it should be should be good but yeah the full frame when you go a little bit more
[02:17:23.040 --> 02:17:27.360]   expensive you're gonna go full frame and sony's probably gonna do a lot more full frame um which
[02:17:27.360 --> 02:17:29.040]   which is gonna be nice.
[02:17:29.040 --> 02:17:30.820]   But yeah, Sony's really, I think,
[02:17:30.820 --> 02:17:31.980]   hitting on all cylinders.
[02:17:31.980 --> 02:17:33.300]   - They really are, yeah.
[02:17:33.300 --> 02:17:34.340]   For the cameras, yeah.
[02:17:34.340 --> 02:17:35.820]   - This sounds like the kind of thing
[02:17:35.820 --> 02:17:38.740]   my son should be using for his reels
[02:17:38.740 --> 02:17:40.360]   and his TikToks and his YouTubes.
[02:17:40.360 --> 02:17:43.820]   - You know, it's funny, I was talking to a Youtuber
[02:17:43.820 --> 02:17:46.480]   and I asked her, like,
[02:17:46.480 --> 02:17:47.820]   "Why are you using a black magic camera?"
[02:17:47.820 --> 02:17:49.980]   And she was just immediately like auto-focus.
[02:17:49.980 --> 02:17:51.060]   - Auto-focus.
[02:17:51.060 --> 02:17:52.360]   - Like he was just like--
[02:17:52.360 --> 02:17:54.540]   - It was interesting, it was just like auto-focus, you know.
[02:17:54.540 --> 02:17:58.180]   And it's good enough that it really,
[02:17:58.180 --> 02:18:00.040]   that's why I sat there in the store
[02:18:00.040 --> 02:18:02.000]   kind of moving around, focusing on this
[02:18:02.000 --> 02:18:03.580]   and focusing on that and seeing how it worked.
[02:18:03.580 --> 02:18:05.040]   And it's really snappy.
[02:18:05.040 --> 02:18:05.880]   - Yeah, they're great.
[02:18:05.880 --> 02:18:06.880]   - So that makes a big difference when you're trying to build that.
[02:18:06.880 --> 02:18:09.480]   - That's, I mean, it is still camera too.
[02:18:09.480 --> 02:18:11.920]   The Alpha Line, the A9 is amazing
[02:18:11.920 --> 02:18:14.320]   how fast it can focus and follow things
[02:18:14.320 --> 02:18:17.120]   and lock in on birds and stuff.
[02:18:17.120 --> 02:18:19.620]   The Cinema Line FX30 Super 35,
[02:18:19.620 --> 02:18:21.720]   it's mayor $1,800, which actually,
[02:18:21.720 --> 02:18:24.360]   you might say, well, that sounds like a lot of money.
[02:18:24.360 --> 02:18:27.940]   - It's hardly anything, it's not even three galaxies.
[02:18:27.940 --> 02:18:28.780]   - Oh, yeah.
[02:18:28.780 --> 02:18:30.740]   - I mean, a lot of the cameras that you buy
[02:18:30.740 --> 02:18:32.860]   in that realm is about that price.
[02:18:32.860 --> 02:18:33.700]   - It's all about the glass.
[02:18:33.700 --> 02:18:34.540]   - I wasn't willing.
[02:18:34.540 --> 02:18:35.740]   - The glass is expensive.
[02:18:35.740 --> 02:18:37.100]   - I spent almost as much on the glass
[02:18:37.100 --> 02:18:38.100]   as I was on the camera.
[02:18:38.100 --> 02:18:39.940]   - And since I have all that great glass,
[02:18:39.940 --> 02:18:42.260]   I'm always looking for a body like that.
[02:18:42.260 --> 02:18:44.180]   - Well, this is a great one if you want to have something
[02:18:44.180 --> 02:18:46.860]   on the road to shoot with that is like your,
[02:18:46.860 --> 02:18:48.780]   I don't know, your video camera.
[02:18:48.780 --> 02:18:49.620]   So that's good.
[02:18:49.620 --> 02:18:53.020]   And it's a full-frame glass, so if I move up,
[02:18:53.020 --> 02:18:54.400]   I'm gonna do something else and do it,
[02:18:54.400 --> 02:18:56.440]   but I think it's good.
[02:18:56.440 --> 02:18:57.680]   - Very nice.
[02:18:57.680 --> 02:19:00.680]   - And in that go, you gotta pick for us.
[02:19:00.680 --> 02:19:02.480]   Yeah, something really, really simple,
[02:19:02.480 --> 02:19:04.760]   but which solves a problem for me.
[02:19:04.760 --> 02:19:06.480]   I was looking for a really cheap,
[02:19:06.480 --> 02:19:09.000]   but really useful flashlight as an everyday carry.
[02:19:09.000 --> 02:19:12.240]   And not in my pockets, but basically,
[02:19:12.240 --> 02:19:14.600]   I want to have a flashlight that's in my,
[02:19:14.600 --> 02:19:18.680]   in my blacktop bag, in my small little bag,
[02:19:18.680 --> 02:19:20.320]   and in my backpack and everything like that.
[02:19:20.320 --> 02:19:23.140]   So that, you never know, and so when I'm taking my walks,
[02:19:23.140 --> 02:19:25.720]   like late at night, I'm not gonna trip and stumble
[02:19:25.720 --> 02:19:27.080]   and wind up in the mud.
[02:19:27.080 --> 02:19:28.560]   And I was looking for something really, really cheap,
[02:19:28.560 --> 02:19:30.240]   and I found something really cheap and cheerful,
[02:19:30.240 --> 02:19:31.800]   and I really liked the design of it.
[02:19:31.800 --> 02:19:36.080]   Now this is, this is, if you do an Amazon or eBay search
[02:19:36.080 --> 02:19:39.220]   for what's called a, it's usually under what's called
[02:19:39.220 --> 02:19:43.760]   C-O-B keychain light, C-O-B, and you'll find them,
[02:19:43.760 --> 02:19:45.600]   it's hysterically funny, if you go on Amazon,
[02:19:45.600 --> 02:19:48.480]   you'll find some sellers will sell you one of these
[02:19:48.480 --> 02:19:53.240]   for $18, someone will sell you like three for 10.
[02:19:53.240 --> 02:19:55.000]   If you go directly to AliExpress,
[02:19:55.000 --> 02:19:57.240]   you can buy them literally for a dollar.
[02:19:57.240 --> 02:19:58.640]   - Wow.
[02:19:58.640 --> 02:20:01.960]   - But it's actually, it's not a piece of junk.
[02:20:01.960 --> 02:20:04.480]   It has three different lighting modes,
[02:20:04.480 --> 02:20:06.200]   two different intensities of light.
[02:20:06.200 --> 02:20:08.960]   It also has a flasher mode, which is another reason why
[02:20:08.960 --> 02:20:10.480]   I needed something like this.
[02:20:10.480 --> 02:20:12.360]   Like when it's late at night, and the,
[02:20:12.360 --> 02:20:15.240]   I can tell that the Uber is kind of in the neighborhood,
[02:20:15.240 --> 02:20:16.480]   but doesn't know where to pick me up.
[02:20:16.480 --> 02:20:17.760]   As soon as I put on the flash,
[02:20:17.760 --> 02:20:20.360]   I'm sure it says, okay, maybe that's where I should go.
[02:20:20.360 --> 02:20:24.480]   But three different modes, it charges via USB-C,
[02:20:24.480 --> 02:20:28.280]   so I can use like my regular charging packs for it.
[02:20:28.280 --> 02:20:30.040]   The design is actually very nice,
[02:20:30.040 --> 02:20:32.840]   it has a carabiner clip, so I can clip it onto
[02:20:32.840 --> 02:20:34.200]   my backpack harness.
[02:20:34.200 --> 02:20:35.760]   It also has a magnet on the back,
[02:20:35.760 --> 02:20:39.280]   so I can just, when the lights go out inevitably
[02:20:39.280 --> 02:20:41.880]   on the MBTA, on the commuter rail,
[02:20:41.880 --> 02:20:46.520]   I can just stick this up on the baggage compartment
[02:20:46.520 --> 02:20:48.120]   and it will illuminate.
[02:20:48.120 --> 02:20:50.480]   It also has a little fold-out stand
[02:20:50.480 --> 02:20:53.640]   with two different annoyances on it.
[02:20:53.640 --> 02:20:58.480]   And the full charge lasts about two or three hours
[02:20:58.480 --> 02:21:00.280]   on the low setting, the bright setting
[02:21:00.280 --> 02:21:02.520]   is kind of almost too bright for me.
[02:21:02.520 --> 02:21:04.720]   But yeah, it's cheap enough that,
[02:21:04.720 --> 02:21:07.000]   I didn't buy them on Alia Express.
[02:21:07.000 --> 02:21:10.480]   I bought one as cheap as I could get it on Amazon
[02:21:10.480 --> 02:21:13.320]   just to see if it would start a fire
[02:21:13.320 --> 02:21:15.560]   after I set leave it charging overnight.
[02:21:15.560 --> 02:21:17.480]   And then after this one worked out for a couple of weeks,
[02:21:17.480 --> 02:21:21.920]   I bought like another four, again, about three bucks each.
[02:21:21.920 --> 02:21:24.880]   And like I say, it's not the most sophisticated flashlight
[02:21:24.880 --> 02:21:27.920]   you can get, it's not a kickstarter
[02:21:27.920 --> 02:21:29.960]   where someone is promising to change the world
[02:21:29.960 --> 02:21:33.640]   and disrupt the mode of artificial LED illumination.
[02:21:33.640 --> 02:21:35.920]   It's just a super cheap Chinese flashlight
[02:21:35.920 --> 02:21:38.080]   that it's simple and small enough
[02:21:38.080 --> 02:21:40.480]   that you can have one exactly everywhere
[02:21:40.480 --> 02:21:42.280]   that you're gonna need it without having to remember,
[02:21:42.280 --> 02:21:44.920]   "Gee, did I remember to bring this with me or not?
[02:21:44.920 --> 02:21:47.600]   "Did I take this out of a certain other thing or not?"
[02:21:47.600 --> 02:21:50.400]   And yeah, it's certainly very well.
[02:21:50.400 --> 02:21:53.200]   And of course, waste not want not on the,
[02:21:53.200 --> 02:21:55.360]   they decided that one of the sides of it,
[02:21:55.360 --> 02:21:57.120]   they decided to put a can opener to it,
[02:21:57.120 --> 02:21:58.200]   bottle opener too.
[02:21:58.200 --> 02:21:59.040]   - Yay!
[02:21:59.040 --> 02:22:01.600]   - So, you know what, you get a lot for your dollar
[02:22:01.600 --> 02:22:02.880]   to $3 a year.
[02:22:02.880 --> 02:22:05.440]   So again, again, you'll find, don't make sure
[02:22:05.440 --> 02:22:07.240]   if you buy it on Amazon, again,
[02:22:07.240 --> 02:22:09.120]   make sure you do math in your head
[02:22:09.120 --> 02:22:10.880]   of how much they're charging
[02:22:10.880 --> 02:22:13.360]   because you will find people who are charging you
[02:22:13.360 --> 02:22:15.760]   truly $19 for one of these.
[02:22:15.760 --> 02:22:18.120]   And then you scroll like half a click
[02:22:18.120 --> 02:22:19.920]   and you'll find, oh, four for $10.
[02:22:19.920 --> 02:22:20.920]   Yeah, that was a bit.
[02:22:20.920 --> 02:22:22.480]   And it's the exact same thing.
[02:22:22.480 --> 02:22:28.000]   - John says that the COB is because the LEDs are arranged
[02:22:28.000 --> 02:22:30.760]   like a corn cob, but in fact,
[02:22:30.760 --> 02:22:34.280]   he's hallucinating like an AI.
[02:22:34.280 --> 02:22:36.480]   That's not what the COB stands for.
[02:22:36.480 --> 02:22:37.800]   - He was probably looking into the light
[02:22:37.800 --> 02:22:39.840]   and it's like, "Oh my God, it's so dazzling."
[02:22:41.120 --> 02:22:43.080]   - So, Kale, there are a lot of them.
[02:22:43.080 --> 02:22:45.440]   I'm tempted to buy the one from a company
[02:22:45.440 --> 02:22:47.840]   whose name looks a lot like Abandoned Ship.
[02:22:47.840 --> 02:22:49.680]   - Abandoned Ship, I know I got that too.
[02:22:49.680 --> 02:22:51.120]   (laughs)
[02:22:51.120 --> 02:22:52.720]   - Just 'cause I like the name,
[02:22:52.720 --> 02:22:57.240]   the pseudo English name that the Chinese company came up with.
[02:22:57.240 --> 02:22:58.600]   Yeah.
[02:22:58.600 --> 02:23:01.520]   - Was that the one you bought, the Abandoned Ships?
[02:23:01.520 --> 02:23:03.480]   - No, no, I think whatever, the one I bought,
[02:23:03.480 --> 02:23:06.040]   I was almost immaterial, which one I kind of,
[02:23:06.040 --> 02:23:07.400]   which I'm being bought from.
[02:23:07.400 --> 02:23:10.240]   The first one I bought from was like $4.
[02:23:10.240 --> 02:23:12.760]   And then there's another one that gives you like 10 for 32
[02:23:12.760 --> 02:23:14.400]   or something.
[02:23:14.400 --> 02:23:16.760]   I might have waited for AliExpress
[02:23:16.760 --> 02:23:21.600]   for literally $1 to wait a couple weeks to give from China.
[02:23:21.600 --> 02:23:22.440]   - Yeah.
[02:23:22.440 --> 02:23:24.920]   - But yeah, I mean, it's, and also at this price,
[02:23:24.920 --> 02:23:26.960]   you can have extras and just give them to people
[02:23:26.960 --> 02:23:28.160]   who need them when you encounter them.
[02:23:28.160 --> 02:23:32.360]   - Here's one that says, "Score 8 has three for $8.99."
[02:23:32.360 --> 02:23:35.480]   That sounds like the, that sounds like the low price leader.
[02:23:35.480 --> 02:23:36.560]   - Yeah. - Yeah.
[02:23:36.560 --> 02:23:37.960]   - And they all do the same thing.
[02:23:37.960 --> 02:23:38.800]   (laughs)
[02:23:38.800 --> 02:23:41.600]   - They probably the same company, right?
[02:23:41.600 --> 02:23:42.600]   - Almost certainly.
[02:23:42.600 --> 02:23:44.840]   And some of them are claiming, oh no, we're,
[02:23:44.840 --> 02:23:47.560]   this is a thousand lumens.
[02:23:47.560 --> 02:23:49.400]   No, no, no, this was 800 lumens.
[02:23:49.400 --> 02:23:51.640]   Oh, this is only 500 lumens.
[02:23:51.640 --> 02:23:53.320]   There might be a couple of different varieties.
[02:23:53.320 --> 02:23:55.360]   I think when I was scrolling, scrolling, scrolling,
[02:23:55.360 --> 02:23:59.640]   I found one or two that were still charging with Micro USB.
[02:23:59.640 --> 02:24:00.640]   - Oh, that's not good.
[02:24:00.640 --> 02:24:01.480]   We don't want that.
[02:24:01.480 --> 02:24:04.160]   - But yeah, but again, just,
[02:24:04.160 --> 02:24:07.600]   as far as I can tell, these are all like the exact same units.
[02:24:07.600 --> 02:24:10.320]   They're just maybe a different days
[02:24:10.320 --> 02:24:11.760]   of different on the assembly line.
[02:24:11.760 --> 02:24:12.600]   - Yeah.
[02:24:12.600 --> 02:24:13.840]   (laughs)
[02:24:13.840 --> 02:24:14.840]   All right.
[02:24:14.840 --> 02:24:17.600]   You know, I think I might order these
[02:24:17.600 --> 02:24:22.480]   'cause I was thinking I should have a flashlight
[02:24:22.480 --> 02:24:23.600]   or two in the backpack,
[02:24:23.600 --> 02:24:25.200]   but I don't wanna carry a big old, you know,
[02:24:25.200 --> 02:24:26.600]   traditional flashlight.
[02:24:26.600 --> 02:24:28.600]   - Yeah, again, this is tiny.
[02:24:28.600 --> 02:24:30.160]   This is like a morsel size.
[02:24:30.160 --> 02:24:31.520]   And also, once again, I can put,
[02:24:31.520 --> 02:24:34.200]   it's two hours off, two or three hours off its own battery,
[02:24:34.200 --> 02:24:36.080]   but it can also power directly off
[02:24:36.080 --> 02:24:40.520]   of my like 20,000 mAh battery for USB USB-C.
[02:24:40.520 --> 02:24:43.560]   And of course, I'm gonna have a USB-C to USB-C cable somewhere.
[02:24:43.560 --> 02:24:45.080]   - I'll do my pick real quick.
[02:24:45.080 --> 02:24:48.360]   It just came out, infinitemac.org.
[02:24:48.360 --> 02:24:53.360]   It is, actually the guy who does this is a legend
[02:24:53.360 --> 02:24:55.960]   and has been doing all sorts of interesting things.
[02:24:55.960 --> 02:24:58.840]   Going back to Grease Monkey Days,
[02:24:58.840 --> 02:25:02.960]   but he has created a web-based simulator
[02:25:02.960 --> 02:25:07.960]   for every version of macOS from system one to system 9.0.4.
[02:25:07.960 --> 02:25:12.680]   And you could just run it.
[02:25:12.680 --> 02:25:15.120]   It'll boop, it'll beep, it'll start up.
[02:25:15.120 --> 02:25:16.960]   You gotta, and look how fast it is.
[02:25:16.960 --> 02:25:20.880]   I don't think that's this, is it?
[02:25:20.880 --> 02:25:24.080]   Is that coming from this?
[02:25:24.080 --> 02:25:29.600]   I wonder if I have something else open.
[02:25:29.600 --> 02:25:30.920]   No, that's it, huh?
[02:25:31.920 --> 02:25:34.000]   All right, this is an infinite Mac.
[02:25:34.000 --> 02:25:34.840]   - Yeah.
[02:25:34.840 --> 02:25:37.800]   - And you see the entire startup process.
[02:25:37.800 --> 02:25:39.280]   You see the happy Mac,
[02:25:39.280 --> 02:25:40.960]   you see all these system extensions loaded
[02:25:40.960 --> 02:25:42.440]   and there's quick time.
[02:25:42.440 --> 02:25:44.920]   - Yeah, let's run disk first aid.
[02:25:44.920 --> 02:25:50.160]   Do the drive, open, it's hysterical.
[02:25:50.160 --> 02:25:52.960]   Anyway, if you have some nostalgia for this,
[02:25:52.960 --> 02:25:56.560]   or you youngens, if you don't remember what it was like
[02:25:56.560 --> 02:25:59.240]   to have a desk accessory called scrapbook,
[02:25:59.240 --> 02:26:00.800]   here's your chance.
[02:26:01.640 --> 02:26:06.640]   To relive the history of the Mac, infinite Macs, all for you.
[02:26:06.640 --> 02:26:12.120]   - And it's not only did you check the hard drive
[02:26:12.120 --> 02:26:15.320]   because here's Photoshop, here's graphic inverter,
[02:26:15.320 --> 02:26:19.080]   here's Kitpix, Pop-Kai's power tips.
[02:26:19.080 --> 02:26:20.280]   - I didn't know that.
[02:26:20.280 --> 02:26:21.600]   So thanks to my high power.
[02:26:21.600 --> 02:26:23.960]   - Photoshop 3.05, par-par-ita.
[02:26:23.960 --> 02:26:29.320]   My high has done tail-scale quip, Chrome apps, Google Reader,
[02:26:29.320 --> 02:26:32.840]   Iconographer, Overplot, Gmail, Greece monkey scripts,
[02:26:32.840 --> 02:26:34.040]   and a whole bunch more.
[02:26:34.040 --> 02:26:35.920]   He's been around for some time,
[02:26:35.920 --> 02:26:38.920]   and he said, "I wanna get this out in March."
[02:26:38.920 --> 02:26:41.400]   So it's out now.
[02:26:41.400 --> 02:26:44.120]   The infinite Mac at infinitemac.org,
[02:26:44.120 --> 02:26:45.000]   just fun to play with.
[02:26:45.000 --> 02:26:47.560]   You can do, there's similar things at archive.org,
[02:26:47.560 --> 02:26:50.360]   but these are really well done, they're really fast.
[02:26:50.360 --> 02:26:53.520]   There's nothing, there's no difference,
[02:26:53.520 --> 02:26:55.920]   I'm running 9.02 right now,
[02:26:55.920 --> 02:26:58.960]   and there's absolutely, there's no stutter,
[02:26:58.960 --> 02:27:01.120]   there's no lag opening.
[02:27:01.120 --> 02:27:03.640]   It's like, I'm sure it's 10 times faster
[02:27:03.640 --> 02:27:05.320]   than any actual 9.02 Mac.
[02:27:05.320 --> 02:27:06.160]   - That's the irony, right?
[02:27:06.160 --> 02:27:07.080]   - That might have been owned.
[02:27:07.080 --> 02:27:09.000]   - Yeah, this is running in the browser,
[02:27:09.000 --> 02:27:11.280]   and it's lots faster.
[02:27:11.280 --> 02:27:12.600]   - Yeah. - Look at this,
[02:27:12.600 --> 02:27:13.840]   your system's seven.
[02:27:13.840 --> 02:27:17.320]   So you say, "Look at the productivity."
[02:27:17.320 --> 02:27:19.840]   Oh, there's Clarisworks.
[02:27:19.840 --> 02:27:21.280]   Wow. (laughs)
[02:27:21.280 --> 02:27:22.560]   And there's the music.
[02:27:22.560 --> 02:27:24.160]   I don't know what the deal is with the music.
[02:27:24.160 --> 02:27:25.440]   Look at that.
[02:27:25.440 --> 02:27:27.000]   Clarisworks- - I'm not getting the music.
[02:27:27.000 --> 02:27:27.840]   - I'm not getting the music.
[02:27:27.840 --> 02:27:28.680]   - I'm not getting the music.
[02:27:28.680 --> 02:27:29.680]   - I'm not getting the music.
[02:27:29.680 --> 02:27:30.680]   - I'm not getting the music.
[02:27:30.680 --> 02:27:32.160]   - I don't get where the music,
[02:27:32.160 --> 02:27:34.680]   maybe it's coming from somewhere else.
[02:27:34.680 --> 02:27:35.680]   - I think it's coming from somewhere else.
[02:27:35.680 --> 02:27:36.520]   I'm not getting it.
[02:27:36.520 --> 02:27:37.680]   (laughs)
[02:27:37.680 --> 02:27:40.320]   - Let's not register Clarisworks right now.
[02:27:40.320 --> 02:27:42.160]   Let's do some word pro.
[02:27:42.160 --> 02:27:43.800]   Look at that. - Yeah.
[02:27:43.800 --> 02:27:44.920]   - That's amazing.
[02:27:44.920 --> 02:27:47.920]   Some memories, memories from the good old days.
[02:27:47.920 --> 02:27:49.720]   Let's just, yeah, look at that.
[02:27:49.720 --> 02:27:51.520]   This is the color one, system seven.
[02:27:51.520 --> 02:27:53.880]   All right, thank you everybody.
[02:27:53.880 --> 02:27:55.800]   That concludes this thrilling gripping edition
[02:27:55.800 --> 02:27:57.560]   of Mac Break Weekly.
[02:27:57.560 --> 02:28:01.160]   We managed to eat out a pretty nice long show.
[02:28:01.160 --> 02:28:02.440]   Thank you, Jason Snell.
[02:28:02.440 --> 02:28:05.280]   You're gonna take over for me next week with Dan Morin
[02:28:05.280 --> 02:28:08.280]   and the regulars, Alex and Andy.
[02:28:08.280 --> 02:28:10.000]   I thank you for doing that, Jason.
[02:28:10.000 --> 02:28:10.840]   - Yep.
[02:28:10.840 --> 02:28:11.680]   Looking forward to it.
[02:28:11.680 --> 02:28:15.520]   - Sixcolors.com/Jason to find all of the things
[02:28:15.520 --> 02:28:16.600]   that he does. - Oh, thanks.
[02:28:16.600 --> 02:28:18.360]   - All of the many things.
[02:28:18.360 --> 02:28:19.200]   Yeah.
[02:28:19.200 --> 02:28:23.560]   He is a legend in the industry.
[02:28:23.560 --> 02:28:28.080]   And I'll be following you on my encrypted wavelength app
[02:28:28.080 --> 02:28:29.320]   as I travel around.
[02:28:29.320 --> 02:28:31.400]   - For many years now, they've been telling the legend
[02:28:31.400 --> 02:28:33.040]   about the guy who led you. - The legend.
[02:28:33.040 --> 02:28:33.880]   - About computers.
[02:28:33.880 --> 02:28:34.720]   - It's the legend.
[02:28:34.720 --> 02:28:36.000]   - Some say he doesn't exist.
[02:28:36.000 --> 02:28:38.400]   Others say he's just a guy who works in his garage.
[02:28:38.400 --> 02:28:41.200]   - Just don't ask him about his big blue ox.
[02:28:41.200 --> 02:28:42.040]   Thank you, Jason.
[02:28:42.040 --> 02:28:43.040]   I appreciate you filling in.
[02:28:43.040 --> 02:28:43.880]   - Thanks, Leo.
[02:28:43.880 --> 02:28:44.720]   - I have a good vacation.
[02:28:44.720 --> 02:28:46.080]   - I will, I promise.
[02:28:46.080 --> 02:28:50.280]   Also, Andy and Akka, when are you gonna be on GBH next?
[02:28:50.280 --> 02:28:53.040]   - Actually, I don't have my schedule for April yet.
[02:28:53.040 --> 02:28:54.240]   I'm off this week.
[02:28:54.240 --> 02:28:58.080]   But go to wgphnews.org to listen to previous shows.
[02:28:58.080 --> 02:29:01.240]   You can also go to the WGBH News channel on YouTube
[02:29:01.240 --> 02:29:03.280]   to see the ones that I did,
[02:29:03.280 --> 02:29:06.760]   the tech news stuff that I did when on either Tuesdays
[02:29:06.760 --> 02:29:09.480]   or Fridays when we were at the Boston Public Library.
[02:29:09.480 --> 02:29:11.920]   We did, I was actually in the Boston Public Library
[02:29:11.920 --> 02:29:16.760]   on last Friday, had a really great chat about chat GPT
[02:29:16.760 --> 02:29:17.760]   and Bard and stuff like that.
[02:29:17.760 --> 02:29:21.000]   The sort of thing where I had a dock at four different topics
[02:29:21.000 --> 02:29:22.720]   and some of them were very, very technical.
[02:29:22.720 --> 02:29:24.040]   And we never got past the fourth one
[02:29:24.040 --> 02:29:27.120]   'cause it was such a good conversation.
[02:29:27.120 --> 02:29:30.280]   - We have learned the music you were hearing
[02:29:30.280 --> 02:29:34.280]   is the un-hold music from the Discord stage.
[02:29:34.280 --> 02:29:37.920]   I thought I had muted my Discord stage,
[02:29:37.920 --> 02:29:40.280]   but apparently I have not, so apologies.
[02:29:40.280 --> 02:29:41.280]   - It sounds like, you know what,
[02:29:41.280 --> 02:29:42.120]   we know it through me.
[02:29:42.120 --> 02:29:44.560]   It sounds like perfect, like technical difficulties,
[02:29:44.560 --> 02:29:46.680]   please stand by, it's totally.
[02:29:46.680 --> 02:29:47.800]   It's even got a little, you know,
[02:29:47.800 --> 02:29:49.040]   Hammond organ in there.
[02:29:49.040 --> 02:29:51.040]   It was quite, I was impressed.
[02:29:51.040 --> 02:29:54.280]   But I apologize, that is not part of Infinite Mac
[02:29:54.280 --> 02:29:55.640]   as much as you wish it.
[02:29:55.640 --> 02:29:59.000]   Office Hours.Global is where you will find
[02:29:59.000 --> 02:30:01.640]   Mr. Alex Lindsey, pretty much any time.
[02:30:01.640 --> 02:30:03.760]   The fundamentals of green screen today
[02:30:03.760 --> 02:30:07.080]   featuring AI generated muppets.
[02:30:07.080 --> 02:30:08.600]   - I did, it was great.
[02:30:08.600 --> 02:30:11.640]   You know, the problem that I have is that I don't,
[02:30:11.640 --> 02:30:14.520]   I don't shoot very much bad green screen.
[02:30:14.520 --> 02:30:15.880]   Like I just, 'cause I'm so particular,
[02:30:15.880 --> 02:30:17.000]   'cause that's gonna cost money.
[02:30:17.000 --> 02:30:18.360]   And I was looking for samples,
[02:30:18.360 --> 02:30:22.440]   I was like, I can't find clean or beat up green screen.
[02:30:22.440 --> 02:30:24.160]   I was like, I bet you I can get it mid-journey
[02:30:24.160 --> 02:30:25.600]   to generate this for me.
[02:30:25.600 --> 02:30:27.120]   And so I just threw it in mid-journey
[02:30:27.120 --> 02:30:28.800]   and I was like, muppets will be funny.
[02:30:28.800 --> 02:30:29.720]   And it turned out really well.
[02:30:29.720 --> 02:30:32.760]   Got wrinkles, I have folds, I have gradients,
[02:30:32.760 --> 02:30:34.480]   I have all the things you shouldn't do with your green screen.
[02:30:34.480 --> 02:30:36.960]   So it was a, it was a lot of fun.
[02:30:36.960 --> 02:30:40.960]   - It's free, it's open to all.
[02:30:40.960 --> 02:30:42.080]   And you can even join the Zoom
[02:30:42.080 --> 02:30:44.720]   if you have questions, details at office hours.global.
[02:30:44.720 --> 02:30:47.960]   And if you wanna hire Alex, as many do,
[02:30:47.960 --> 02:30:51.080]   to run your next live streaming event,
[02:30:51.080 --> 02:30:55.640]   or just to consult, he is at 090.media.
[02:30:55.640 --> 02:30:58.080]   090.media.
[02:30:58.080 --> 02:31:00.440]   - Oh, the $1,000 studio on Friday.
[02:31:00.440 --> 02:31:03.360]   - Yeah, we're gonna kinda go up,
[02:31:03.360 --> 02:31:04.800]   so we're gonna start at 1,000,
[02:31:04.800 --> 02:31:08.400]   then there's a $10,000 studio, $25,000.
[02:31:08.400 --> 02:31:09.880]   Like, you know, like what would you do
[02:31:09.880 --> 02:31:10.920]   if you had more money?
[02:31:10.920 --> 02:31:12.080]   Like what would you add to it?
[02:31:12.080 --> 02:31:13.080]   So we're starting at 1,000,
[02:31:13.080 --> 02:31:15.560]   and we'll go up over the next couple months,
[02:31:15.560 --> 02:31:16.400]   you know, one month of time.
[02:31:16.400 --> 02:31:19.680]   Just to talk about what equipment is,
[02:31:19.680 --> 02:31:21.520]   what would you add when that's possible?
[02:31:21.520 --> 02:31:22.360]   - That's cool.
[02:31:22.360 --> 02:31:23.360]   - 'Cause a lot of people build in studios right now.
[02:31:23.360 --> 02:31:24.360]   So we're talking about it,
[02:31:24.360 --> 02:31:26.640]   'cause a lot of companies are looking at building their own.
[02:31:26.640 --> 02:31:27.720]   - Awesome.
[02:31:27.720 --> 02:31:28.960]   Thank you, Alex, thank you, Andy.
[02:31:28.960 --> 02:31:30.120]   Thank you, Jason.
[02:31:30.120 --> 02:31:33.400]   Be back next week, Jason, with Dan Moore and Alex Lindsey.
[02:31:33.400 --> 02:31:36.000]   Andy, and I call Michael Sargent's gonna host the show
[02:31:36.000 --> 02:31:36.840]   the week's following.
[02:31:36.840 --> 02:31:40.200]   I will be back about a month from, believe it or not,
[02:31:40.200 --> 02:31:41.520]   about a month from now.
[02:31:42.600 --> 02:31:46.200]   My next show will be on April 25th,
[02:31:46.200 --> 02:31:48.400]   and I will be--
[02:31:48.400 --> 02:31:49.840]   - Long delayed vacation, yeah.
[02:31:49.840 --> 02:31:53.680]   - Yeah, this is actually a vacation we booked in 2019.
[02:31:53.680 --> 02:31:57.320]   It was canceled twice, I believe, during COVID.
[02:31:57.320 --> 02:32:00.480]   And finally, we're gonna get to go to a different place,
[02:32:00.480 --> 02:32:02.240]   but that's okay.
[02:32:02.240 --> 02:32:04.000]   - Everybody, appreciate your being here.
[02:32:04.000 --> 02:32:05.000]   We do Mac break weekly.
[02:32:05.000 --> 02:32:07.680]   On Tuesdays, 11 a.m. Pacific, 2 p.m. Eastern,
[02:32:07.680 --> 02:32:10.800]   1800 UTC, the live stream, audio,
[02:32:10.800 --> 02:32:13.320]   or video at live.twit.tv.
[02:32:13.320 --> 02:32:15.060]   Watching live chat live with us,
[02:32:15.060 --> 02:32:17.120]   I-R-C.twit.tv.
[02:32:17.120 --> 02:32:18.200]   If you're a club member, of course,
[02:32:18.200 --> 02:32:21.360]   the Discord is also a great place to hang.
[02:32:21.360 --> 02:32:23.360]   After the fact, on demand versions of the show
[02:32:23.360 --> 02:32:26.320]   are available, ad supported, or in this case not,
[02:32:26.320 --> 02:32:31.320]   at, geez, twit.tv/mbw.
[02:32:31.320 --> 02:32:35.160]   You can also get a YouTube,
[02:32:35.160 --> 02:32:36.760]   there's a YouTube channel dedicated to it.
[02:32:36.760 --> 02:32:39.440]   Actually, the easiest thing to do is go to youtube.com/twit.
[02:32:39.440 --> 02:32:41.760]   All of the shows that have dedicated YouTube channels
[02:32:41.760 --> 02:32:43.800]   are listed there, so you can subscribe
[02:32:43.800 --> 02:32:45.840]   to the ones you wanna follow.
[02:32:45.840 --> 02:32:47.520]   Probably the easiest subscription though,
[02:32:47.520 --> 02:32:49.000]   is to do it in a podcast player,
[02:32:49.000 --> 02:32:50.400]   that way you'll get it, it'll download,
[02:32:50.400 --> 02:32:52.400]   you can get audio or video, your choice.
[02:32:52.400 --> 02:32:54.480]   It'll download and you'll have it
[02:32:54.480 --> 02:32:57.600]   for your listening or viewing pleasure anytime
[02:32:57.600 --> 02:33:00.760]   as fits your needs.
[02:33:00.760 --> 02:33:02.560]   Thanks for being here, but now I have to say,
[02:33:02.560 --> 02:33:06.920]   I'm sorry, I get back to work 'cause break time is over.
