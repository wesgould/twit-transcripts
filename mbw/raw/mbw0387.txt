[00:00:01.960 --> 00:00:04.920]   The quarterly results are in for Apple's first quarter,
[00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:09.220]   the holiday buying quarter, and boy, are they good.
[00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:11.000]   Even though Wall Street didn't like them too much,
[00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.320]   we'll talk about that with our panel next.
[00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:14.880]   It's not Mac Break Weekly.

[00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.240]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly.
[00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:45.480]   Look, we've reassembled the crew.
[00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:47.080]   In fact, somebody said in the chatroom, it's so true.
[00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:50.560]   If Merlin Man were only here, then the band would be complete.
[00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:53.400]   It'd be like the Beatles reunion at the Grammys.
[00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:57.040]   But fortunately, of course, Merlin is no longer with us
[00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:59.600]   and Scott Born.
[00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:02.960]   But we have the wonderful Andy Inako,
[00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:07.280]   who's been with his show almost since the beginning, I believe.
[00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:09.440]   You're making it sound like the Hunger Games only
[00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:11.200]   with tech news.
[00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:13.760]   It's like we put a pile of weapons in the middle of this studio.
[00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:16.440]   You've been training in the high altitudes of Rwanda,
[00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:18.120]   but you know what?
[00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.280]   I've learned a lot of weapons in the middle of this studio.
[00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:21.760]   The colonial guerrilla warfare.
[00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:22.960]   By the way, Merlin is not dead.
[00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:23.960]   He's no longer with us.
[00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:26.000]   He's here in the world.
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.400]   Alex Lindsey is the guy who created MacBreak before I even
[00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:30.240]   did anything with it.
[00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:32.080]   He did the video version of MacBreak.
[00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:35.000]   And you were, I think, the guy who suggested we do MacBreak
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.520]   weekly as an audio program.
[00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:38.160]   Well, we did it.
[00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:40.240]   I think we actually did it for a little while.
[00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:43.400]   You were involved in a couple of the early Mac videos.
[00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:45.400]   And even in the audio, I believe.
[00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:47.360]   And then the problem is, every time you were on the audio
[00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:49.400]   and it was so much more popular, and I was like,
[00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:51.480]   you should just take this.
[00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:52.480]   So here, here, have this.
[00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:53.640]   So there you go.
[00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:54.200]   There you go.
[00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:57.760]   And by the way, speaking of there you go, where are you?
[00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:59.600]   I am in Washington, DC.
[00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:01.160]   Is this your new facility?
[00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:02.440]   Is there other office?
[00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:03.480]   It's not really new.
[00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:04.680]   It's been around for a little while.
[00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:05.040]   I'll show you.
[00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:06.080]   Hold on, let's see.
[00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:10.440]   So this is when you really get crazy about running Hangouts.
[00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:13.000]   You have a facility that looks like that.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   So that's the control room.
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.320]   Now that can bring in fiber, satellite,
[00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:19.440]   from all over the world.
[00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:21.960]   What kind of pipes do you have in there?
[00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:24.720]   It's just a 100 by 100 up and down,
[00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:27.280]   but then we have video pipes.
[00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:33.600]   So we can use either the switch or Vivix or Avoc, HD fiber.
[00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:37.560]   And then we also have-- there's 26 satellite dishes on the roof
[00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:39.160]   that we don't own them all, but we have access to them.
[00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:40.880]   So you can book them when you need them, basically.
[00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:45.960]   Yeah, we can book satellite time up and down from the roof.
[00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:46.680]   And I'm on there.
[00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:47.280]   And I don't know.
[00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:49.960]   Are we allowed to say what you're doing or is it a secret?
[00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:51.000]   No, we're not allowed to say.
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   OK.
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.640]   But anyway, so basically, when the Whig party wants
[00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:56.840]   to do their response to the State of the Union,
[00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:01.480]   there's going to be a guy awkwardly sitting in your studio.
[00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:02.960]   An alpha-federalist response.
[00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:04.640]   We do a lot of work for the Whig party.
[00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:05.760]   So no, no.
[00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:08.760]   So it's-- yeah, we're obviously doing some stuff here
[00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:11.040]   that I have to manage.
[00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:12.120]   But we do a lot of things here.
[00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:15.480]   Basically, we run almost all of our major Hangouts
[00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:18.280]   out of this facility.
[00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:20.760]   There's all the servers in the back back back there,
[00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:21.240]   you can see.
[00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:23.960]   And then there's a whole other set of servers
[00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:24.960]   that sit in the tech core.
[00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:28.440]   This is where actually all the European television stations
[00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:28.920]   are hosted.
[00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:32.240]   So all the way down the hallway from here is Russia 1.
[00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:33.440]   And then there's Belgian 1.
[00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:35.400]   And then there's Deutsch, something or other.
[00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:36.680]   And BBC is upstairs.
[00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:40.840]   And so it's a pretty densely populated building.
[00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:41.920]   Nido.
[00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:42.360]   Yeah.
[00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:43.800]   Are you across from the White House?
[00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:44.560]   Are you there?
[00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:45.440]   Where are you?
[00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:46.480]   We're about eight blocks.
[00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:47.880]   Eight blocks from the White House.
[00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:50.680]   But the fiber from the White House actually
[00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:54.320]   terminates about 100 feet from this office.
[00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:57.560]   Can you smell the big block of cheese from there?
[00:04:57.560 --> 00:04:58.320]   No, it's all right.
[00:04:58.320 --> 00:04:59.360]   I'm moving on.
[00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:00.840]   Thank you, Alex Lindsey.
[00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:04.680]   And also Renee Ritchie here from imore.com.
[00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:08.240]   And he is sitting in front of the vintage Apple TV,
[00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:09.800]   the original Apple TV.
[00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:11.560]   My setup just seems so meager now.
[00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:13.400]   But I know.
[00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:13.920]   I know.
[00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:14.920]   It's like a webcam.
[00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:15.920]   I have a cable modem.
[00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:18.840]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:19.360]   I know.
[00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:22.080]   We all are put to shame by Alex Lindsey.
[00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:23.320]   He's like a NORAD.
[00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:28.080]   It's worse for me because he's also got an office right here
[00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:29.080]   in the building.
[00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:31.120]   And I look at what we do, then I go over there.
[00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:32.240]   And it's like, oh dear.
[00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:32.680]   It's like--
[00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:33.560]   It keeps you warm, though.
[00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:35.160]   Well, yes, see, I'm all jealous because you
[00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:36.960]   do the same thing in the same place every day.
[00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:37.960]   Every day.
[00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:38.760]   It's just like--
[00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:39.440]   Oh my gosh.
[00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:41.200]   If I just get up and just turn the stuff on,
[00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:42.840]   I don't have to put it in delicate cases.
[00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:44.160]   So they don't have to--
[00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:47.960]   Last night, I was in at Delos schlepping eight or six,
[00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:49.520]   like, 100 pound cases in an hour.
[00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:51.560]   Oh, man.
[00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:53.960]   I just sometimes I just wish I could just work a twit.
[00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:56.040]   And I just show up.
[00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:58.480]   By the way, Beatmaster tells me that Renee, you actually
[00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:00.480]   put an article on I'm Worry about your podcast setup.
[00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:03.280]   So if you want to know what Renee's using--
[00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:04.840]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:06.200]   Yeah, not after Alex is a little--
[00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:07.920]   Don't bring that up now, he says.
[00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:11.360]   Why are you bringing that up now?
[00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:14.400]   Hey, an update on the Mac Pro.
[00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:16.640]   And I'm curious, because I think I'm the only one in the bunch
[00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:21.680]   who actually has one, thanks to Ed Ingebarr, who very kindly
[00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:24.560]   let me buy his from him.
[00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:27.800]   This is the new Cylinder Mac Pro.
[00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:29.000]   What was that picture from?
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.600]   That was a good picture, because it's exactly what it looks like.
[00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:34.000]   This is from John-- John's leading the synthesis
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:34.880]   over an email.
[00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:35.840]   And it's all German.
[00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:36.640]   You can see like--
[00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:38.480]   Lou Ray, long--
[00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:40.400]   I'm going to bring a picture of my Mac Pro,
[00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:41.960]   because it's exactly what it looks like on the right.
[00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:43.480]   So on the left, you see the Cheese Grader, which
[00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:44.880]   has everything internal.
[00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:48.320]   And in fact, all right, it's big, but it does look kind of tidy.
[00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:52.960]   On the right, you see the Elegant Mac Pro with three GTEC
[00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:54.880]   drives next to it.
[00:06:54.880 --> 00:07:00.840]   CD, burner, DVD, burner, USB, hub, all the crap
[00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:02.000]   you need to go along with.
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.760]   So apparently from giga.de.
[00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:07.440]   So let me just mention a couple of things.
[00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:09.720]   And maybe, Renee, because you have been keeping up
[00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:13.440]   on the Mavericks bugs, and I think these are related.
[00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:15.960]   Audio gums and goes randomly.
[00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:17.000]   Core audio is not your friend.
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:17.880]   That's core audio.
[00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:19.400]   OK, that's a Mavericks bug.
[00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:22.160]   Now I can't-- you know, I use a Magic Trackpad wireless
[00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:23.600]   and a wireless keyboard.
[00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:25.400]   And they just stopped working.
[00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:26.920]   Bluetooth is on.
[00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:28.680]   I haven't gone to the point of trying
[00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:30.760]   Bluetooth on other stuff, but I just
[00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:32.600]   can't get my keyboard in a trackpad to buy.
[00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:36.760]   I actually had to buy a wired keyboard in a USB mouse.
[00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:38.560]   Is that a known--
[00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:39.680]   I haven't heard of that yet.
[00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:42.280]   My good friend and co-host Guy English got his Mac Pro,
[00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:45.240]   and he said it is the best Gotham Archimacile game
[00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:47.560]   playing machine he's ever had.
[00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:48.560]   I will vouch for that.
[00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:49.760]   Bioshock infinite.
[00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:51.040]   Wonderful.
[00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:53.320]   Turn everything up.
[00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:54.200]   Yeah.
[00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:56.880]   But we haven't dived too deeply into it yet,
[00:07:56.880 --> 00:07:58.560]   because it's so scarce still.
[00:07:58.560 --> 00:08:00.320]   Of course, I changed the batteries and the keyboard
[00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:00.760]   in trackpad.
[00:08:00.760 --> 00:08:02.680]   You think I'm nuts?
[00:08:02.680 --> 00:08:06.400]   You know, we just recorded a couple of the Mac break studios
[00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:09.120]   for Final Cut and Motion with it.
[00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:11.840]   We got a loaner of Mac Pro over at the office.
[00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:14.440]   I mean, just for a day to do it.
[00:08:14.440 --> 00:08:15.800]   Mark Spencer brought it in.
[00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:19.760]   And I can say for Final Cut, it's screaming.
[00:08:19.760 --> 00:08:20.680]   Oh, I bet.
[00:08:20.680 --> 00:08:21.400]   Like four times.
[00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:21.960]   I mean, it just--
[00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:22.480]   I bet.
[00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:24.680]   --the laptop was just chugging on.
[00:08:24.680 --> 00:08:26.600]   I mean, like a really nice well-built retina
[00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:28.840]   that it just kind of just breezes through nothing happened.
[00:08:28.840 --> 00:08:30.480]   It just cuts it right through it like butter.
[00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:33.720]   And you mentioned that you wanted to try it.
[00:08:33.720 --> 00:08:35.400]   So I'm going to bring mine in for you Saturday.
[00:08:35.400 --> 00:08:36.200]   Yeah, I want to try it.
[00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:37.400]   I want to play with it on 3D.
[00:08:37.400 --> 00:08:39.160]   That we were doing the video stuff is all great.
[00:08:39.160 --> 00:08:41.800]   Now, what I want to do is to open up something like Cinema 4D
[00:08:41.800 --> 00:08:44.760]   and look at how it renders global illumination
[00:08:44.760 --> 00:08:45.720]   and that type of thing.
[00:08:45.720 --> 00:08:48.800]   Not just using Cinebench, but really playing around with it.
[00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:51.280]   And you heard that one of your people
[00:08:51.280 --> 00:08:54.120]   said that it spontaneously was shutting down on him?
[00:08:54.120 --> 00:08:55.840]   Yeah, we've had a couple of folks
[00:08:55.840 --> 00:08:58.760]   say that there's an issue where it just kind of restarts.
[00:08:58.760 --> 00:09:01.000]   So we're not really sure exactly.
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:04.280]   It definitely had us-- when we heard the report of a couple
[00:09:04.280 --> 00:09:07.800]   of folks that I knew saying that, we were like, maybe
[00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:12.080]   we won't make it a live event box just yet.
[00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:14.640]   So that's obviously restarting is fine if you're going post.
[00:09:14.640 --> 00:09:16.000]   If it happens really instantly.
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:19.200]   And it's concerning, but not the end of the world
[00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:22.960]   on a live event, it would be unfortunate.
[00:09:22.960 --> 00:09:25.880]   Well, as you know, you saw the final cam.
[00:09:25.880 --> 00:09:30.040]   I love it in like a man.
[00:09:30.040 --> 00:09:31.360]   But-- I'm sorry.
[00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:32.880]   I'm like a woman.
[00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:36.360]   But that's actually an in joke around here.
[00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:40.480]   Because we had a woman on the radio show who called up.
[00:09:40.480 --> 00:09:42.280]   And she was from Chicago.
[00:09:42.280 --> 00:09:43.400]   She was great.
[00:09:43.400 --> 00:09:48.440]   And she was saying, I got rid of my phone, and I'm now using
[00:09:48.440 --> 00:09:49.960]   a Note 3.
[00:09:49.960 --> 00:09:51.120]   I said, oh, that's the big one.
[00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:51.640]   You like it?
[00:09:51.640 --> 00:09:52.600]   She said, I don't like it.
[00:09:52.600 --> 00:09:54.840]   I love it like a man.
[00:09:54.840 --> 00:10:02.600]   So I've been saying that it actually works really great.
[00:10:02.600 --> 00:10:04.040]   All the time now, every time.
[00:10:04.040 --> 00:10:05.040]   I finish all my sentences.
[00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:08.480]   Like a man.
[00:10:08.480 --> 00:10:09.880]   I loved her on 227.
[00:10:09.880 --> 00:10:14.680]   I thought that she was the one turn of that show.
[00:10:14.680 --> 00:10:18.720]   Anyway, just an update on the Mac, bro.
[00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:20.520]   I'm not sure I would recommend against it.
[00:10:20.520 --> 00:10:23.920]   You know if you need it, you know it, and you probably want it.
[00:10:23.920 --> 00:10:28.000]   But maybe it's a Maverick's beer problem.
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:29.240]   I don't know.
[00:10:29.240 --> 00:10:31.240]   We're giving it some time.
[00:10:31.240 --> 00:10:32.920]   We know that there's a little bit of time to wait for it.
[00:10:32.920 --> 00:10:33.840]   And we're not in a real rush.
[00:10:33.840 --> 00:10:35.440]   We're just going to let things sort themselves out.
[00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:41.000]   And then casually get them when a quietly aversion,
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:42.440]   two or three is already running.
[00:10:42.440 --> 00:10:45.920]   I think that's sensible with anything.
[00:10:45.920 --> 00:10:47.280]   But this is new hardware.
[00:10:47.280 --> 00:10:49.280]   And it does seem like there might be some issues early on.
[00:10:49.280 --> 00:10:50.680]   So I think it would be sensible.
[00:10:50.680 --> 00:10:54.240]   The good news is you can't get it till March anyway.
[00:10:54.240 --> 00:10:56.640]   If you go to iMore right now, Peter Cohen just put up
[00:10:56.640 --> 00:11:00.320]   an article about his least favorite Mavericks pet peeves.
[00:11:00.320 --> 00:11:01.520]   Oh, I'm sure there are a few.
[00:11:01.520 --> 00:11:05.480]   He's got a bunch of little things that make you pull your hair out
[00:11:05.480 --> 00:11:07.760]   that we really hope Apple fixes in the next update.
[00:11:07.760 --> 00:11:10.800]   Apple's first quarter results are in.
[00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:12.800]   This is, of course, the big holiday shopping quarter.
[00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:15.240]   And a big, big story.
[00:11:15.240 --> 00:11:16.720]   We will break it down for you.
[00:11:16.720 --> 00:11:18.480]   All the numbers, all the news coming up
[00:11:18.480 --> 00:11:18.880]   in just a bit.
[00:11:18.880 --> 00:11:21.480]   Renee Ritchie, Alex Lindsey, Andy Inako.
[00:11:21.480 --> 00:11:23.440]   You're watching Mac Break Weekly, our show today
[00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:27.680]   brought to you by personalcapital.com.
[00:11:27.680 --> 00:11:28.520]   You know, this is really--
[00:11:28.520 --> 00:11:31.880]   I think people might think this isn't something I need yet,
[00:11:31.880 --> 00:11:32.560]   because I'm young.
[00:11:32.560 --> 00:11:34.600]   I'm just starting out or whatever.
[00:11:34.600 --> 00:11:36.480]   I don't have a lot of money, so I don't have to worry
[00:11:36.480 --> 00:11:37.080]   about investments.
[00:11:37.080 --> 00:11:39.200]   You always should be paying attention to this stuff.
[00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:44.120]   Personal capital lets you keep track of your money,
[00:11:44.120 --> 00:11:45.880]   not like a checkbook balancing program,
[00:11:45.880 --> 00:11:51.840]   but making sure your financial life is planned out.
[00:11:51.840 --> 00:11:52.760]   And that's a pain.
[00:11:52.760 --> 00:11:53.720]   I never did it before.
[00:11:53.720 --> 00:11:55.080]   In fact, I wish I'd done it a little bit better
[00:11:55.080 --> 00:11:56.800]   when I was younger.
[00:11:56.800 --> 00:11:58.200]   There are two kind of big problems
[00:11:58.200 --> 00:11:59.920]   of people and how they manage their money.
[00:11:59.920 --> 00:12:02.720]   One, of course, it's hard to keep track of.
[00:12:02.720 --> 00:12:03.920]   Not only do you have your paycheck,
[00:12:03.920 --> 00:12:06.320]   but you probably have a 401k or an iris.
[00:12:06.320 --> 00:12:07.240]   You've got bank accounts.
[00:12:07.240 --> 00:12:10.200]   You've got mortgages, charge cards, all of that,
[00:12:10.200 --> 00:12:13.120]   all on different sites, different names and passwords.
[00:12:13.120 --> 00:12:16.280]   The other problem, of course, is if you do want to make
[00:12:16.280 --> 00:12:18.280]   investments, you're paying somebody to manage your money,
[00:12:18.280 --> 00:12:20.120]   and you're probably paying too much.
[00:12:20.120 --> 00:12:21.800]   Along comes personal capital.
[00:12:21.800 --> 00:12:23.720]   It's free.
[00:12:23.720 --> 00:12:27.280]   You see all of your financial life on one screen,
[00:12:27.280 --> 00:12:30.000]   how each asset's performing, your computer,
[00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:36.160]   they also have iPhone and iPad apps, clean color-coded graphs,
[00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:40.360]   shows you how much you're paying in money managers and fees,
[00:12:40.360 --> 00:12:44.120]   just the fees on your mutual funds, how you can reduce those.
[00:12:44.120 --> 00:12:45.680]   You can also get specific advice on how
[00:12:45.680 --> 00:12:47.800]   to improve your investment strategy.
[00:12:47.800 --> 00:12:49.800]   This is all free personal capital.
[00:12:49.800 --> 00:12:52.200]   It's a smart way to make your money grow quicker.
[00:12:52.200 --> 00:12:54.920]   That's why they've been featured in Time, Forbes, Bloomberg,
[00:12:54.920 --> 00:12:57.160]   and more, and we're going to get you a free count right now
[00:12:57.160 --> 00:13:00.400]   if you go to personal capital.com/macbreak.
[00:13:00.400 --> 00:13:01.560]   Getting set up just takes a minute.
[00:13:01.560 --> 00:13:05.440]   It's free, but you have to go to personal capital.com.
[00:13:05.440 --> 00:13:09.880]   In fact, let me do that/macbreak and sign up today.
[00:13:09.880 --> 00:13:14.480]   That way, they know that you heard it on the show,
[00:13:14.480 --> 00:13:16.120]   and you get extra special treatment.
[00:13:16.120 --> 00:13:18.360]   Personal capital.com/macbreak.
[00:13:18.360 --> 00:13:20.160]   We thank them for their support.
[00:13:20.160 --> 00:13:23.200]   Apple has a lot of money to keep track of themselves.
[00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:25.680]   I wonder if they're using personal capital.
[00:13:25.680 --> 00:13:29.920]   $159 billion in the bank.
[00:13:29.920 --> 00:13:31.040]   That's my bank account.
[00:13:31.040 --> 00:13:35.120]   $159 billion in their bank account.
[00:13:35.120 --> 00:13:37.480]   Interesting, Peter Oppenheimer, the CFO on the call,
[00:13:37.480 --> 00:13:40.680]   said 70% of that is international, which
[00:13:40.680 --> 00:13:44.280]   shows you why it's very difficult for Apple to repatriate
[00:13:44.280 --> 00:13:47.920]   either to buy stuff or to give it back to stockholders.
[00:13:47.920 --> 00:13:52.320]   There's huge tax consequences to repatriating that money.
[00:13:52.320 --> 00:13:58.440]   Record quarterly revenue, $57.6 billion.
[00:13:58.440 --> 00:14:02.040]   Record net profit, $13.1 billion.
[00:14:02.040 --> 00:14:04.440]   To put that in perspective, Microsoft, which announced its
[00:14:04.440 --> 00:14:08.040]   results a few days earlier, was half that.
[00:14:08.040 --> 00:14:09.040]   Half that much profit.
[00:14:09.040 --> 00:14:17.880]   And the stock market didn't like it for a few reasons.
[00:14:17.880 --> 00:14:19.120]   Net profit was not up.
[00:14:19.120 --> 00:14:25.280]   It was exactly the same as year to year, $13.1 billion.
[00:14:25.280 --> 00:14:28.840]   The gross margins were down a little bit, 37.9%,
[00:14:28.840 --> 00:14:31.360]   compared to 38.6%.
[00:14:31.360 --> 00:14:35.080]   International sales accounted for 63% of the quarter's revenue.
[00:14:35.080 --> 00:14:36.880]   I think that's interesting.
[00:14:36.880 --> 00:14:40.040]   Now, that's what the stock market cares about.
[00:14:40.040 --> 00:14:41.640]   Here's the numbers we care about.
[00:14:41.640 --> 00:14:44.360]   Actually, the stock market might care about this a little bit.
[00:14:44.360 --> 00:14:47.600]   Analysts were predicting 55 million iPhones in the quarter.
[00:14:47.600 --> 00:14:50.040]   51 million sold.
[00:14:50.040 --> 00:14:52.880]   That's probably if you're going to pick one thing that's
[00:14:52.880 --> 00:14:55.160]   worrying the market, that might be it.
[00:14:55.160 --> 00:14:59.520]   However, it's a record number of iPhones, more than this time
[00:14:59.520 --> 00:15:01.520]   last year, $47.8 million.
[00:15:01.520 --> 00:15:07.400]   They sold 26 million iPads, also an all-time quarterly record,
[00:15:07.400 --> 00:15:10.760]   compared to $22.9 million a year ago.
[00:15:10.760 --> 00:15:12.640]   Mac sales were up.
[00:15:12.640 --> 00:15:16.920]   This is something I'm a Mac lover.
[00:15:16.920 --> 00:15:20.080]   And the Mac sales were went from $4.1 million last year
[00:15:20.080 --> 00:15:21.320]   to $4.8 million this year.
[00:15:21.320 --> 00:15:27.240]   Now, you compare $4.8 million Macs to a total of $77 million
[00:15:27.240 --> 00:15:28.440]   iOS devices.
[00:15:28.440 --> 00:15:30.320]   It's not that important to the bottom line.
[00:15:30.320 --> 00:15:37.400]   But thoughts, those are the numbers.
[00:15:37.400 --> 00:15:39.360]   Well, I think that the difference between what
[00:15:39.360 --> 00:15:41.880]   the projections were and what they actually
[00:15:41.880 --> 00:15:44.960]   sold as far as the numbers for the iPhones, most likely,
[00:15:44.960 --> 00:15:47.160]   had to deal with supply chain issues.
[00:15:47.160 --> 00:15:49.080]   Because I think that's what that Peter Oppenheimer said.
[00:15:49.080 --> 00:15:50.520]   We could have sold more.
[00:15:50.520 --> 00:15:54.520]   We had constrained supply until the very end of the quarter.
[00:15:54.520 --> 00:15:56.000]   So I think that they probably would have met it.
[00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:57.400]   It wasn't from a lack of demand.
[00:15:57.400 --> 00:15:59.000]   It was just a lack of--
[00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:00.400]   and I think the same thing, you probably
[00:16:00.400 --> 00:16:03.320]   saw lower numbers with the Mac Pro sales,
[00:16:03.320 --> 00:16:09.320]   both because it was a late release, as well as a very
[00:16:09.320 --> 00:16:10.480]   constrained supply.
[00:16:10.480 --> 00:16:13.320]   So I think that those are two things that were probably
[00:16:13.320 --> 00:16:14.000]   factors here.
[00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:15.920]   I do find it amazing that everyone's disappointed
[00:16:15.920 --> 00:16:17.000]   when they have--
[00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:18.360]   how many records can you set?
[00:16:18.360 --> 00:16:18.840]   I know.
[00:16:18.840 --> 00:16:21.120]   I guess you're expected to make-- do I have a record year?
[00:16:21.120 --> 00:16:23.680]   Every quarter should be a record quarter, which is almost
[00:16:23.680 --> 00:16:25.960]   what it is for Apple, almost every single one.
[00:16:25.960 --> 00:16:28.240]   We should point out Apple's stock is over $500.
[00:16:28.240 --> 00:16:29.560]   It's very well valued.
[00:16:29.560 --> 00:16:32.160]   It's not that the market is saying, oh, my god,
[00:16:32.160 --> 00:16:33.440]   this company's in trouble.
[00:16:33.440 --> 00:16:36.120]   But it did drop 8% in after hours trading.
[00:16:36.120 --> 00:16:39.440]   It's now down 7.63%.
[00:16:39.440 --> 00:16:42.040]   It doesn't enjoy the ratio that a stock like Amazon or even
[00:16:42.040 --> 00:16:43.800]   Google's enjoys, which bothers some people.
[00:16:43.800 --> 00:16:45.080]   Christ to earnings ratio.
[00:16:45.080 --> 00:16:46.080]   Yeah.
[00:16:46.080 --> 00:16:46.760]   Yeah.
[00:16:46.760 --> 00:16:49.200]   It's an expensive stock.
[00:16:49.200 --> 00:16:51.040]   They were also upset about Apple's guidance,
[00:16:51.040 --> 00:16:52.600]   even though Oppenheimer did a fairly good job
[00:16:52.600 --> 00:16:55.680]   explaining things like they're deferring much more income
[00:16:55.680 --> 00:16:56.760]   now for iPhones.
[00:16:56.760 --> 00:16:58.960]   And they're also doing it for Macs, because Mavericks is free.
[00:16:58.960 --> 00:16:59.800]   I work is free.
[00:16:59.800 --> 00:17:01.040]   I life is free.
[00:17:01.040 --> 00:17:02.240]   So that means billions of dollars
[00:17:02.240 --> 00:17:03.680]   move from one quarter to a next.
[00:17:03.680 --> 00:17:06.400]   But I think a lot of people just look at the raw numbers
[00:17:06.400 --> 00:17:08.760]   and say, oh, it's not as much as I'd like it to be in the next
[00:17:08.760 --> 00:17:09.200]   quarter.
[00:17:09.200 --> 00:17:11.040]   I do think that one of the things that they showed
[00:17:11.040 --> 00:17:14.560]   was a rise in the ASP average sell price.
[00:17:14.560 --> 00:17:17.240]   So I think that that was an interesting selling price,
[00:17:17.240 --> 00:17:19.560]   I believe, which is interesting that they're getting more out
[00:17:19.560 --> 00:17:22.040]   of a lot of these than they had in the past.
[00:17:22.040 --> 00:17:24.280]   But margins are going down.
[00:17:24.280 --> 00:17:24.720]   Right.
[00:17:24.720 --> 00:17:26.760]   Margins were down, but they said the margins would go back up
[00:17:26.760 --> 00:17:28.440]   because they've gotten better at making the stuff.
[00:17:28.440 --> 00:17:31.240]   The iPhone 5C did not sell as well as they expected,
[00:17:31.240 --> 00:17:34.240]   because the iPhone 5S sold better than they expected.
[00:17:34.240 --> 00:17:36.600]   And Tim Cook said that was because of Touch ID
[00:17:36.600 --> 00:17:39.240]   and some of the new for what the Apple calls the forward
[00:17:39.240 --> 00:17:42.040]   thinking features like 64-bit and the better.
[00:17:42.040 --> 00:17:45.400]   I also don't think $100 really distinguishes the 5C
[00:17:45.400 --> 00:17:46.480]   from the 5S.
[00:17:46.480 --> 00:17:47.480]   That was the number one problem.
[00:17:47.480 --> 00:17:49.000]   Go ahead, Randy.
[00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:51.280]   I was just going to say that that was--
[00:17:51.280 --> 00:17:54.320]   it's the way to turn a negative into a positive saying,
[00:17:54.320 --> 00:17:57.880]   well, we didn't sell as many 5Cs because we sold so many 5Ss.
[00:17:57.880 --> 00:18:00.120]   It was the positive touch.
[00:18:00.120 --> 00:18:05.040]   I agree with Alex that 99 bucks is not a huge difference
[00:18:05.040 --> 00:18:08.840]   for people who are attracted to iPhones in general.
[00:18:08.840 --> 00:18:12.680]   I think that I'm inclined to take away the impression
[00:18:12.680 --> 00:18:17.400]   that people who buy iPhones do it with very clear intentions
[00:18:17.400 --> 00:18:18.360]   and very clear purposes.
[00:18:18.360 --> 00:18:22.560]   They don't just buy it because they have their site set
[00:18:22.560 --> 00:18:23.720]   on an iPhone.
[00:18:23.720 --> 00:18:27.680]   And if you give them two phones side by side and two iPhone
[00:18:27.680 --> 00:18:31.200]   side by side and tell them this one is better than this one,
[00:18:31.200 --> 00:18:34.080]   which is the budget one, they're going to spend the 99 bucks
[00:18:34.080 --> 00:18:35.480]   to get the better one.
[00:18:35.480 --> 00:18:38.200]   And they are not having as much success
[00:18:38.200 --> 00:18:40.160]   competing with the people who don't really care,
[00:18:40.160 --> 00:18:41.800]   who don't really see those distinctions,
[00:18:41.800 --> 00:18:43.840]   for whom they're going to say, well, why is this 99 bucks?
[00:18:43.840 --> 00:18:45.560]   I can get a phone that looks exactly like this.
[00:18:45.560 --> 00:18:46.080]   It does.
[00:18:46.080 --> 00:18:48.360]   It has a great software library for $50 or free.
[00:18:48.360 --> 00:18:50.400]   And they're still not going to be reaching those people.
[00:18:50.400 --> 00:18:52.440]   But it's likely that they're never
[00:18:52.440 --> 00:18:54.320]   going to reach those people.
[00:18:54.320 --> 00:18:56.560]   Yeah, I think it's fine for Apple to say,
[00:18:56.560 --> 00:18:59.360]   hey, we're the high priced spread and live with it.
[00:18:59.360 --> 00:19:00.200]   It's very tough.
[00:19:00.200 --> 00:19:05.080]   I just bought a 32 gig unlocked MotoX Unsubsidized
[00:19:05.080 --> 00:19:08.120]   for $350 brand new with a wood back.
[00:19:08.120 --> 00:19:09.360]   That's going to be--
[00:19:09.360 --> 00:19:12.000]   I think there's going to be a lot of new pressure
[00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:14.400]   from Android in 2014 that wasn't there in 2013,
[00:19:14.400 --> 00:19:16.360]   because the second half of last year
[00:19:16.360 --> 00:19:19.080]   was the time when lots of different major makers
[00:19:19.080 --> 00:19:22.760]   started making a priority to creating an affordable--
[00:19:22.760 --> 00:19:25.720]   affordable-- bring your own device.
[00:19:25.720 --> 00:19:29.280]   And in the US, at least, with the T-Mobile and other providers
[00:19:29.280 --> 00:19:31.560]   providing so many really great plans for people
[00:19:31.560 --> 00:19:34.560]   who bring their own devices in, I wonder how much pressure
[00:19:34.560 --> 00:19:37.720]   Apple's going to feel to deal with these people that
[00:19:37.720 --> 00:19:40.960]   would much rather spend $350, $400, even $200
[00:19:40.960 --> 00:19:43.360]   to own their own Android device and then take it
[00:19:43.360 --> 00:19:46.400]   wherever they want off of contract, versus $200
[00:19:46.400 --> 00:19:47.520]   you're locked in.
[00:19:47.520 --> 00:19:51.040]   And the differences between these handsets
[00:19:51.040 --> 00:19:52.920]   are becoming a little bit more fine grain
[00:19:52.920 --> 00:19:55.240]   than they were in 2012, say.
[00:19:55.240 --> 00:19:57.120]   There was a really good piece from Benedict Evans,
[00:19:57.120 --> 00:19:59.280]   who's a telecom analysis analyst.
[00:19:59.280 --> 00:20:00.720]   And he's actually just moving to the US.
[00:20:00.720 --> 00:20:03.000]   He got a job with an investment firm.
[00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:05.520]   But he did the math based on current volume,
[00:20:05.520 --> 00:20:06.920]   what Apple could expect to generate,
[00:20:06.920 --> 00:20:09.200]   like how many iPhones they can sell
[00:20:09.200 --> 00:20:10.800]   before they start to hit the roof.
[00:20:10.800 --> 00:20:13.160]   And it's still something like, it's in the hundreds
[00:20:13.160 --> 00:20:14.200]   of millions, half a billion.
[00:20:14.200 --> 00:20:17.640]   And that's still a huge market, bigger than any previous PC
[00:20:17.640 --> 00:20:18.280]   market.
[00:20:18.280 --> 00:20:20.360]   But he was also pointing out that it's changing so fast
[00:20:20.360 --> 00:20:22.120]   that he has no idea, for example, what
[00:20:22.120 --> 00:20:24.120]   install an app on an Android smartphone
[00:20:24.120 --> 00:20:25.640]   will mean in a couple of years.
[00:20:25.640 --> 00:20:28.360]   And that it's hard to judge whether you should go lower
[00:20:28.360 --> 00:20:29.960]   in a market or higher in a market,
[00:20:29.960 --> 00:20:33.640]   because it's changing so rapidly now still.
[00:20:33.640 --> 00:20:36.400]   Apple's guidance for the second quarter,
[00:20:36.400 --> 00:20:39.760]   revenue between 42 and 44 billion gross margin,
[00:20:39.760 --> 00:20:43.600]   not much change between 37% and 38%.
[00:20:43.600 --> 00:20:47.000]   They pointed out that their tax rate is 26.2%.
[00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:49.320]   So there, we pay taxes.
[00:20:49.320 --> 00:20:49.880]   So there.
[00:20:49.880 --> 00:20:53.600]   And when you have a profit of $13.1 billion,
[00:20:53.600 --> 00:20:55.840]   that's a pretty big check you're writing to Uncle Sam
[00:20:55.840 --> 00:20:58.480]   every year.
[00:20:58.480 --> 00:21:02.640]   I think the-- well, again, I'm showing my Mac bias here.
[00:21:02.640 --> 00:21:06.520]   My my bias towards the computer.
[00:21:06.520 --> 00:21:12.160]   But in a quarter where PC sales are down 10%,
[00:21:12.160 --> 00:21:16.200]   for Apple to report an increase of something like 30%
[00:21:16.200 --> 00:21:19.800]   is pretty good news.
[00:21:19.800 --> 00:21:22.000]   It kind of gives lie to the idea that people
[00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:24.000]   aren't buying computers anymore.
[00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:26.160]   Well, but I think that also that there's--
[00:21:26.160 --> 00:21:29.160]   the numbers for Apple are growing are much smaller
[00:21:29.160 --> 00:21:30.720]   than the general PC numbers.
[00:21:30.720 --> 00:21:31.920]   So I think that--
[00:21:31.920 --> 00:21:33.360]   Like the hundreds.
[00:21:33.360 --> 00:21:36.560]   Yeah, so they can-- in that vertical,
[00:21:36.560 --> 00:21:39.800]   in the vertical that buys a Mac, obviously people
[00:21:39.800 --> 00:21:40.840]   are still buying those.
[00:21:40.840 --> 00:21:42.800]   I think that they're not competing as much.
[00:21:42.800 --> 00:21:45.960]   I don't think Macintosh's don't compete as much with iPads,
[00:21:45.960 --> 00:21:50.000]   for instance, as a netbook does or lower cost computers,
[00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:50.520]   I think.
[00:21:50.520 --> 00:21:54.120]   Or-- and I'm not saying iPads, but also just a lot of tablets,
[00:21:54.120 --> 00:21:57.320]   a lot of moving towards tablets for those types of things.
[00:21:57.320 --> 00:22:01.240]   And so I think that I definitely use my Mac for what
[00:22:01.240 --> 00:22:03.040]   I think that has to be used for.
[00:22:03.040 --> 00:22:04.800]   I think there's a lot of people there doing that.
[00:22:04.800 --> 00:22:06.720]   It's not just a check email.
[00:22:06.720 --> 00:22:10.360]   I think you got to say that Windows 8 is a flop,
[00:22:10.360 --> 00:22:11.600]   and people are not--
[00:22:11.600 --> 00:22:14.360]   There were lots of reasons why people aren't buying PCs,
[00:22:14.360 --> 00:22:16.840]   but Windows 8 has to be a part of it.
[00:22:16.840 --> 00:22:19.080]   Well, I think that you always have to remember
[00:22:19.080 --> 00:22:21.800]   that the Windows market is totally different from the Mac
[00:22:21.800 --> 00:22:22.800]   market.
[00:22:22.800 --> 00:22:26.000]   A Windows Notebook looks like a Mac book,
[00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:27.880]   but it's a totally different type of person
[00:22:27.880 --> 00:22:29.800]   who's buying it with totally different priorities.
[00:22:29.800 --> 00:22:33.400]   When you look at the pie chart for Windows operating systems
[00:22:33.400 --> 00:22:37.200]   that are in the field, a huge chunk of it is still Windows XP.
[00:22:37.200 --> 00:22:40.120]   And I think it's more significant to see how well Windows 7 is
[00:22:40.120 --> 00:22:41.960]   doing, because right now that is perceived
[00:22:41.960 --> 00:22:45.360]   by the Windows community as here is the non-experimental,
[00:22:45.360 --> 00:22:46.760]   the tried and true, the tested.
[00:22:46.760 --> 00:22:48.160]   We've been through this.
[00:22:48.160 --> 00:22:49.480]   We've been through the upgrade.
[00:22:49.480 --> 00:22:51.600]   We've gotten people trained up on this operating system.
[00:22:51.600 --> 00:22:52.720]   No, you're right.
[00:22:52.720 --> 00:22:54.080]   And that's doing very, very well.
[00:22:54.080 --> 00:22:54.600]   And you're also--
[00:22:54.600 --> 00:22:55.100]   It is.
[00:22:55.100 --> 00:22:57.400]   Windows 7 sales were up in the quarter.
[00:22:57.400 --> 00:22:58.000]   Yeah.
[00:22:58.000 --> 00:22:58.800]   Exactly.
[00:22:58.800 --> 00:23:01.200]   Especially now that more makers are--
[00:23:01.200 --> 00:23:05.600]   yes, understanding that Windows 8 has not been--
[00:23:05.600 --> 00:23:07.800]   there are very few people getting Windows 8 tattoos, let's
[00:23:07.800 --> 00:23:08.920]   say.
[00:23:08.920 --> 00:23:11.400]   And so now more makers are going back to, well,
[00:23:11.400 --> 00:23:12.040]   OK, you know what?
[00:23:12.040 --> 00:23:14.800]   Why don't we start offering our new hardware pre-installed
[00:23:14.800 --> 00:23:18.000]   with Windows 7 instead of 8 and whoop people are trying.
[00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:20.800]   HP really spittin Microsoft's face,
[00:23:20.800 --> 00:23:24.600]   saying back by popular demand, Windows 7 in a big ad
[00:23:24.600 --> 00:23:25.600]   this week.
[00:23:25.600 --> 00:23:28.100]   The big difficulty is that you sell Windows 8
[00:23:28.100 --> 00:23:32.380]   by selling the multi-touch and selling a touchscreen device.
[00:23:32.380 --> 00:23:35.180]   But unfortunately, Microsoft has not
[00:23:35.180 --> 00:23:37.500]   been able to get enough developers on board to really say,
[00:23:37.500 --> 00:23:38.900]   well, here are the really awesome apps
[00:23:38.900 --> 00:23:42.100]   that you would want to run on Windows 8 that could not really
[00:23:42.100 --> 00:23:44.300]   exist very well under Windows 7.
[00:23:44.300 --> 00:23:47.100]   And when you get people who are not terribly interested
[00:23:47.100 --> 00:23:52.340]   in multi-touch on a laptop, then they see this as Windows 7
[00:23:52.340 --> 00:23:55.020]   with more unfamiliar stuff on it.
[00:23:55.020 --> 00:24:00.700]   So this is a key cultural debate going on that
[00:24:00.700 --> 00:24:03.300]   is fascinating to track, which is, do people
[00:24:03.300 --> 00:24:04.540]   want a convergence device?
[00:24:04.540 --> 00:24:08.180]   Do people want to spend $800 on one device that does it all,
[00:24:08.180 --> 00:24:11.580]   especially now that we have devices that cost about the same
[00:24:11.580 --> 00:24:15.140]   as a nicely loaded iPad that are not that heavier than an iPad,
[00:24:15.140 --> 00:24:19.060]   they get the same battery life as an iPad, or just philosophically,
[00:24:19.060 --> 00:24:21.860]   do they believe that I want to own a tablet and a notebook?
[00:24:21.860 --> 00:24:24.340]   I want to own a device that is specifically optimized
[00:24:24.340 --> 00:24:25.500]   for notebook things.
[00:24:25.500 --> 00:24:28.020]   And then I want a tablet that even has a smaller screen
[00:24:28.020 --> 00:24:29.180]   than a full-size iPad.
[00:24:29.180 --> 00:24:30.940]   That's even lighter than a full-size iPad,
[00:24:30.940 --> 00:24:33.260]   because when I'm in tablet mode, I want something
[00:24:33.260 --> 00:24:36.260]   as far away from my conventional laptop experiences
[00:24:36.260 --> 00:24:37.580]   I can possibly get.
[00:24:37.580 --> 00:24:39.660]   So people like me like to think, well, but geez,
[00:24:39.660 --> 00:24:41.220]   why am we-- it's kind of--
[00:24:41.220 --> 00:24:45.380]   it offends my delicate, neo-realist sensibilities
[00:24:45.380 --> 00:24:47.460]   to be carrying two computers with me on my--
[00:24:47.460 --> 00:24:49.260]   as a check and carry on.
[00:24:49.260 --> 00:24:51.180]   But I think most people are now proving
[00:24:51.180 --> 00:24:52.420]   that they're actually kind of cool with it.
[00:24:52.420 --> 00:24:55.180]   They'd much rather have a full-size laptop
[00:24:55.180 --> 00:24:59.180]   and a side car in the form of a tablet.
[00:24:59.180 --> 00:25:00.980]   Well, and if that's you, there's very good news.
[00:25:00.980 --> 00:25:04.380]   Jason Snell on the occasion of the 30th anniversary of the Mac
[00:25:04.380 --> 00:25:07.220]   got to talk to Phil Schiller, Craig Federighi,
[00:25:07.220 --> 00:25:10.220]   and Bud Triple about a lot of things.
[00:25:10.220 --> 00:25:14.220]   But if you scroll down a little ways in the interview,
[00:25:14.220 --> 00:25:19.980]   he asks Craig Federighi, who is now in charge of all software.
[00:25:19.980 --> 00:25:22.580]   And that might indicate that Apple's thinking of merging iOS
[00:25:22.580 --> 00:25:25.620]   and OS 10 about that.
[00:25:25.620 --> 00:25:28.460]   And Federighi said absolutely not.
[00:25:28.460 --> 00:25:31.340]   He says the reason OS 10 has a different interface than iOS
[00:25:31.340 --> 00:25:33.540]   isn't because one came after the other,
[00:25:33.540 --> 00:25:35.580]   or because this one's old and this one's new.
[00:25:35.580 --> 00:25:38.180]   It's because using a mouse and keyboard
[00:25:38.180 --> 00:25:41.020]   just isn't the same as tapping with your finger.
[00:25:41.020 --> 00:25:43.660]   This device, he says, pointing out a MacBook Air,
[00:25:43.660 --> 00:25:48.060]   has been honed over 30 years to be optimal for keyboards
[00:25:48.060 --> 00:25:49.980]   and mice.
[00:25:49.980 --> 00:25:53.140]   Schiller and Federighi both made clear Apple believes competitors,
[00:25:53.140 --> 00:25:55.780]   in other words, Microsoft, who try to attach a touchscreen
[00:25:55.780 --> 00:25:57.340]   to a PC or a clamshell keyboard
[00:25:57.340 --> 00:26:00.620]   and a tablet or barking up the wrong tree.
[00:26:00.620 --> 00:26:05.420]   They say there will not be a convergence to say iOS
[00:26:05.420 --> 00:26:08.700]   and OS 10 should be the same independent of their purpose.
[00:26:08.700 --> 00:26:10.460]   Let's just converge for the sake of convergence.
[00:26:10.460 --> 00:26:13.740]   It's absolutely a non-goal.
[00:26:13.740 --> 00:26:15.140]   This is Federighi again.
[00:26:15.140 --> 00:26:17.260]   You don't want to say the Mac became less good at being
[00:26:17.260 --> 00:26:19.820]   a Mac because someone tried to turn it into iOS.
[00:26:19.820 --> 00:26:21.180]   I have to say, that's a great relief
[00:26:21.180 --> 00:26:24.180]   because after seeing what happened with Windows,
[00:26:24.180 --> 00:26:27.540]   it's pretty clear that's not where you want to go.
[00:26:27.540 --> 00:26:29.460]   - Apple's never said that they're never going to do something
[00:26:29.460 --> 00:26:30.740]   and then do it.
[00:26:30.740 --> 00:26:35.460]   - Yeah, he said it's a non-goal.
[00:26:35.460 --> 00:26:37.020]   - Well, the funny thing is,
[00:26:37.020 --> 00:26:38.340]   when there's so many things Apple's like,
[00:26:38.340 --> 00:26:40.420]   no one's ever going to want that and then they make one.
[00:26:40.420 --> 00:26:43.860]   - No, they didn't even class exactly.
[00:26:43.860 --> 00:26:45.500]   - With the Newton OS either.
[00:26:45.500 --> 00:26:48.020]   I mean, what they gave an answer that is specific to this time
[00:26:48.020 --> 00:26:48.940]   and this frame of thinking,
[00:26:48.940 --> 00:26:51.340]   but I think that answer has been way too broadly interpreted.
[00:26:51.340 --> 00:26:53.340]   - Phil Schiller said it's not an either or it's a world
[00:26:53.340 --> 00:26:55.020]   where you're going to have, as Andy said,
[00:26:55.020 --> 00:26:58.940]   a phone, a tablet, a computer, and you don't have to choose.
[00:26:58.940 --> 00:27:01.620]   So what's more important, and I like this philosophy,
[00:27:01.620 --> 00:27:04.300]   is how you seamlessly move between them all.
[00:27:04.300 --> 00:27:07.780]   Now, if they could only get airdrop to work
[00:27:07.780 --> 00:27:11.020]   between iOS and OS 10, I believe them.
[00:27:11.020 --> 00:27:13.620]   It's not like this is a laptop person
[00:27:13.620 --> 00:27:14.780]   and that's a little tablet person.
[00:27:14.780 --> 00:27:17.300]   It doesn't have to be that way.
[00:27:17.300 --> 00:27:18.900]   In fact, when I walked in there,
[00:27:18.900 --> 00:27:20.900]   they noticed I'd brought a phone, a tablet, and a laptop,
[00:27:20.900 --> 00:27:23.900]   and used my Air Z tool of choice for the interview.
[00:27:23.900 --> 00:27:25.540]   You had a bunch of tools, Craig said,
[00:27:25.540 --> 00:27:27.300]   and you pulled out the one that felt right for the job
[00:27:27.300 --> 00:27:28.460]   you were doing.
[00:27:28.460 --> 00:27:30.180]   Not because it had more computing power,
[00:27:30.180 --> 00:27:32.340]   because it was the most natural device.
[00:27:32.340 --> 00:27:33.620]   I like that other thinking.
[00:27:33.620 --> 00:27:35.260]   I agree, it's not, you know, can't--
[00:27:35.260 --> 00:27:37.620]   - You purchased three things from us, not just one.
[00:27:37.620 --> 00:27:42.460]   That means it was greatly, you will be invited back.
[00:27:42.460 --> 00:27:43.940]   (laughing)
[00:27:43.940 --> 00:27:46.900]   - I do think that's absolutely on the money.
[00:27:46.900 --> 00:27:48.700]   I don't think that people are ready yet
[00:27:48.700 --> 00:27:51.060]   to really fully cast their lot with one device
[00:27:51.060 --> 00:27:52.580]   being a multi-touch, with a single device
[00:27:52.580 --> 00:27:54.140]   that's single device being multi-touch.
[00:27:54.140 --> 00:27:56.780]   However, I do think the momentum is heading there.
[00:27:56.780 --> 00:27:58.180]   This is something we've discussed before that
[00:27:58.180 --> 00:28:01.460]   we get more people who are entering the adult job market
[00:28:01.460 --> 00:28:03.100]   who grew up with multi-touch
[00:28:03.100 --> 00:28:06.460]   that they just don't have to think of their input device
[00:28:06.460 --> 00:28:07.540]   as primarily keyboard.
[00:28:07.540 --> 00:28:08.940]   They are more open to simply saying,
[00:28:08.940 --> 00:28:10.900]   "Well, what if I just take this device,
[00:28:10.900 --> 00:28:12.940]   "I spend $600 for this iPad
[00:28:12.940 --> 00:28:16.100]   "and figure out how to do all of my editing,
[00:28:16.100 --> 00:28:16.940]   "all of my creation,
[00:28:16.940 --> 00:28:19.460]   "then really all my communications through it?"
[00:28:19.460 --> 00:28:21.380]   It's possible that they're moving away
[00:28:21.380 --> 00:28:23.340]   from having multiple mobile devices
[00:28:23.340 --> 00:28:26.180]   and towards having, I'm gonna have one really nice server
[00:28:26.180 --> 00:28:28.900]   at my house for applications and documents.
[00:28:28.900 --> 00:28:31.300]   I'm gonna have one desktop for full-board,
[00:28:31.300 --> 00:28:33.780]   desktop crunch mode, but for every time
[00:28:33.780 --> 00:28:35.140]   that I'm not inside my office,
[00:28:35.140 --> 00:28:36.540]   I'm gonna have something that is lightweight
[00:28:36.540 --> 00:28:38.740]   that can access all my data and all my apps.
[00:28:40.860 --> 00:28:44.180]   When I look at my kids again, they're constantly,
[00:28:44.180 --> 00:28:45.940]   I mean, you can definitely see any laptop they touch
[00:28:45.940 --> 00:28:47.660]   as all these little fingerprints all the way across them
[00:28:47.660 --> 00:28:50.220]   'cause they're so used to their iOS.
[00:28:50.220 --> 00:28:52.740]   - Every time I try to use an iPad to do the stuff
[00:28:52.740 --> 00:28:54.020]   that I would do on a computer,
[00:28:54.020 --> 00:28:56.860]   like let's say booking a reservation or,
[00:28:56.860 --> 00:28:59.420]   you know, stuff right, it always feels like it's a strain.
[00:28:59.420 --> 00:29:01.540]   I can do it, but it's hard.
[00:29:01.540 --> 00:29:03.940]   - Yeah, you're having a lot of spook.
[00:29:03.940 --> 00:29:06.020]   - I think it also, if you're using a webpage
[00:29:06.020 --> 00:29:07.500]   and trying to do that, it's really painful.
[00:29:07.500 --> 00:29:11.860]   I know that I book a lot of hotels on hotels.com
[00:29:11.860 --> 00:29:13.820]   on my iPhone 'cause I'll be sitting there thinking about,
[00:29:13.820 --> 00:29:14.660]   oh, I gotta do this,
[00:29:14.660 --> 00:29:16.660]   and because everything's kind of built into it,
[00:29:16.660 --> 00:29:18.820]   like if I go to a webpage, it would be,
[00:29:18.820 --> 00:29:20.540]   I don't know, it would take me half a day
[00:29:20.540 --> 00:29:21.700]   and I never bother.
[00:29:21.700 --> 00:29:23.260]   But an app that is built for that
[00:29:23.260 --> 00:29:24.900]   that has your information all built into it
[00:29:24.900 --> 00:29:26.420]   and everything else, it actually is--
[00:29:26.420 --> 00:29:27.620]   - Yeah, but that means you need an app
[00:29:27.620 --> 00:29:29.620]   for every damn thing you do.
[00:29:29.620 --> 00:29:32.020]   - Well, anything you do regularly, yeah.
[00:29:32.020 --> 00:29:33.300]   I have a lot of apps.
[00:29:33.300 --> 00:29:35.100]   - Well, there'd be a 30th anniversary of iOS
[00:29:35.100 --> 00:29:36.620]   where we had 30th anniversary of the Mac.
[00:29:36.620 --> 00:29:37.460]   - That's what I keep wondering.
[00:29:37.460 --> 00:29:38.540]   - Oh, that's interesting.
[00:29:38.540 --> 00:29:39.780]   - What would be as long a product cycle
[00:29:39.780 --> 00:29:41.300]   or will it change much more rapidly?
[00:29:41.300 --> 00:29:43.260]   - 2037.
[00:29:43.260 --> 00:29:45.340]   - Well, the Mac, the Mac, iOS has changed.
[00:29:45.340 --> 00:29:47.220]   - I would get it, you understand, but okay.
[00:29:47.220 --> 00:29:48.820]   - It's version one.
[00:29:48.820 --> 00:29:51.300]   I ever get excited about the Mac OS.
[00:29:51.300 --> 00:29:52.180]   - What?
[00:29:52.180 --> 00:29:53.620]   - But has it?
[00:29:53.620 --> 00:29:54.940]   If you were to take a,
[00:29:54.940 --> 00:29:58.980]   look at a screenshot of system 1.2 or 1.1,
[00:29:58.980 --> 00:30:00.620]   whatever ship would be Mac 128,
[00:30:00.620 --> 00:30:03.420]   and put it next to Mavericks right now,
[00:30:03.420 --> 00:30:08.420]   and put an iMac next to a Mac 128.
[00:30:08.420 --> 00:30:13.100]   In terms of molecular interface to the human being,
[00:30:13.100 --> 00:30:14.460]   you still have screen over here,
[00:30:14.460 --> 00:30:16.700]   keyboard over here, input device right here.
[00:30:16.700 --> 00:30:18.340]   You still have windows.
[00:30:18.340 --> 00:30:20.180]   The Finder is still largely untouched.
[00:30:20.180 --> 00:30:21.340]   There's been, there's of course,
[00:30:21.340 --> 00:30:24.340]   there's been a huge amount of power added to it,
[00:30:24.340 --> 00:30:25.980]   but you're still overlapping windows
[00:30:25.980 --> 00:30:28.780]   that drag around the people have to manage manually
[00:30:28.780 --> 00:30:31.220]   and icons on the desktop that become way too cluttered
[00:30:31.220 --> 00:30:34.420]   when you've got way too much, way too much data on it.
[00:30:34.420 --> 00:30:37.220]   So Apple, I think, is wise enough to understand
[00:30:37.220 --> 00:30:40.460]   the value of the legacy that the Mac has
[00:30:40.460 --> 00:30:43.060]   and the value of the legacy that iOS has,
[00:30:43.060 --> 00:30:46.980]   but they may have been free at one point to simply say,
[00:30:46.980 --> 00:30:49.780]   10 point, when we get to Mac OS 11,
[00:30:49.780 --> 00:30:53.540]   don't expect to see the Finder in any way, shape or form,
[00:30:53.540 --> 00:30:56.260]   and don't expect to see the same control surfaces
[00:30:56.260 --> 00:30:57.660]   and the same control inputs,
[00:30:57.660 --> 00:30:59.780]   the way that we've always done them.
[00:30:59.780 --> 00:31:03.180]   I think that we're, I don't wanna preamp my pick of the week,
[00:31:03.180 --> 00:31:08.180]   but iOS 7 is a really good release for people to look at
[00:31:08.180 --> 00:31:10.220]   when they're looking at Apple's core philosophy
[00:31:10.220 --> 00:31:11.700]   on developing things.
[00:31:11.700 --> 00:31:15.540]   At some point, they said that our old interface now sucks.
[00:31:15.540 --> 00:31:17.300]   It was working for a great amount of time.
[00:31:17.300 --> 00:31:19.260]   It took us where we wanted to go,
[00:31:19.260 --> 00:31:22.780]   but now we are willing to piss off a great deal of people
[00:31:22.780 --> 00:31:24.380]   by a great percentage of our users,
[00:31:24.380 --> 00:31:26.020]   by giving them something unfamiliar
[00:31:26.020 --> 00:31:28.460]   that will look very, very freaky in the hopes
[00:31:28.460 --> 00:31:30.140]   that will prompt our entire community
[00:31:30.140 --> 00:31:32.300]   to adopt to a vision of user interface
[00:31:32.300 --> 00:31:33.980]   that we really, really like.
[00:31:33.980 --> 00:31:37.220]   And although there was, the pain point was pretty severe
[00:31:37.220 --> 00:31:40.100]   in the fall when iOS 7 was first widely released,
[00:31:40.100 --> 00:31:42.580]   now that we've got three or four months or five months
[00:31:42.580 --> 00:31:44.740]   behind us, and now that we've got developers
[00:31:44.740 --> 00:31:48.220]   who have been spending more than close to a year,
[00:31:48.220 --> 00:31:51.340]   not only just looking at the user interface guidelines,
[00:31:51.340 --> 00:31:52.700]   but seriously thinking,
[00:31:52.700 --> 00:31:54.860]   well, we're gonna throw away our entire interface
[00:31:54.860 --> 00:31:57.340]   and now rebuild it with these new guidelines.
[00:31:57.340 --> 00:31:59.980]   Now finally, here in January of 2014,
[00:31:59.980 --> 00:32:02.620]   we're starting to see apps that really bear fruit,
[00:32:02.620 --> 00:32:04.780]   where that really sell the idea of iOS 7,
[00:32:04.780 --> 00:32:09.220]   that you really couldn't articulate in that way in iOS 6.
[00:32:09.220 --> 00:32:11.900]   So I think that maybe we're gonna be going that same way,
[00:32:11.900 --> 00:32:14.700]   I think MacOS is gonna have to have that point too.
[00:32:14.700 --> 00:32:16.340]   It'll still be called macOS,
[00:32:16.340 --> 00:32:17.580]   but there's going to be that point
[00:32:17.580 --> 00:32:21.740]   where we no longer recognize it as window here,
[00:32:21.740 --> 00:32:23.980]   icon here, drop down menu there,
[00:32:23.980 --> 00:32:26.340]   pointing device keyboard, here's the screen.
[00:32:27.180 --> 00:32:29.660]   I'll tell you one thing,
[00:32:29.660 --> 00:32:31.820]   yes, Patrick Jellahaney points out our chat room,
[00:32:31.820 --> 00:32:35.700]   yesterday, fourth anniversary of the iPad.
[00:32:35.700 --> 00:32:40.580]   So 30th anniversary is 26 years off.
[00:32:40.580 --> 00:32:41.980]   We got a ways to go.
[00:32:41.980 --> 00:32:44.660]   One thing that may not make it to its 30th anniversary,
[00:32:44.660 --> 00:32:49.660]   the iPod, sales of the iPod down 52%.
[00:32:49.660 --> 00:32:55.020]   They sold a mere 6 million iPods,
[00:32:55.020 --> 00:33:00.020]   that's $973 million out of their 57.6 billion revenue.
[00:33:00.020 --> 00:33:03.220]   I don't know when they're gonna kill the iPod,
[00:33:03.220 --> 00:33:04.620]   but they didn't mention it,
[00:33:04.620 --> 00:33:06.460]   there were no new iPods this year,
[00:33:06.460 --> 00:33:09.260]   they didn't mention it all year long.
[00:33:09.260 --> 00:33:13.300]   I think it's soon, isn't it?
[00:33:13.300 --> 00:33:15.100]   - Well, they switched it to a two year product cycle
[00:33:15.100 --> 00:33:16.780]   a couple of years ago, they do a revision
[00:33:16.780 --> 00:33:18.620]   when they do the new design for the iPhone,
[00:33:18.620 --> 00:33:20.340]   and they do a color, a new color,
[00:33:20.340 --> 00:33:22.820]   when they do the S version of the iPhone.
[00:33:22.820 --> 00:33:24.980]   So this year we got space gray.
[00:33:24.980 --> 00:33:27.100]   But this to me highlights what we were talking about earlier,
[00:33:27.100 --> 00:33:30.180]   about Apple's vision for products.
[00:33:30.180 --> 00:33:34.140]   They, some companies would have held onto the iPod revenue,
[00:33:34.140 --> 00:33:35.820]   until it fell out of their cold dead hands,
[00:33:35.820 --> 00:33:37.380]   it would have ridden it into the ground,
[00:33:37.380 --> 00:33:38.620]   and they would have spent all their time
[00:33:38.620 --> 00:33:39.860]   and energy trying to prop it up,
[00:33:39.860 --> 00:33:43.540]   where Apple's kind of recognizes the iPod is going down,
[00:33:43.540 --> 00:33:45.460]   and they fill it on one end with the iPhone,
[00:33:45.460 --> 00:33:48.100]   on the other end with an iPad, and then an iPad mini.
[00:33:48.100 --> 00:33:51.660]   So in one way, I lament that it is going away,
[00:33:51.660 --> 00:33:53.540]   but on the other hand, we have much better options.
[00:33:53.540 --> 00:33:56.180]   Now we have connected devices and large screen devices,
[00:33:56.180 --> 00:33:59.180]   and soon they'll have capacity beyond what an iPad,
[00:33:59.180 --> 00:34:00.420]   sorry an iPod could have.
[00:34:00.420 --> 00:34:03.340]   - Yeah, I have to say that I love iPod touches,
[00:34:03.340 --> 00:34:07.820]   which I have, we use them as like these little utility vehicles.
[00:34:07.820 --> 00:34:09.420]   You know, like, so we don't really use them to,
[00:34:09.420 --> 00:34:12.980]   as a viewer or to play music, but, you know,
[00:34:12.980 --> 00:34:14.860]   a lot of our kits have them, I have a couple of them,
[00:34:14.860 --> 00:34:17.540]   and I'll use them for clocks and interfaces,
[00:34:17.540 --> 00:34:20.180]   and other things that I wanna kind of pop up
[00:34:20.180 --> 00:34:22.140]   as heads up as plays, and just very inexpensive,
[00:34:22.140 --> 00:34:23.620]   and very small, and you can carry a couple of them
[00:34:23.620 --> 00:34:24.940]   to kind of manage stuff.
[00:34:24.940 --> 00:34:28.140]   And I just find that they're great little mini trucks,
[00:34:28.140 --> 00:34:31.300]   they're kind of like golf carts to handle a lot of things.
[00:34:31.300 --> 00:34:33.420]   - Yeah, that's a better, that's a more apt analogy.
[00:34:33.420 --> 00:34:35.260]   Golf cart, I think that Apple is definitely--
[00:34:35.260 --> 00:34:39.220]   - I think that Apple is definitely taking a user like you
[00:34:39.220 --> 00:34:41.940]   and saying, well, why don't you buy an iPad mini,
[00:34:41.940 --> 00:34:44.780]   which is even better, also doesn't require a monthly data plan
[00:34:44.780 --> 00:34:49.300]   if you don't wanna buy the 4G version or the LTE version of it.
[00:34:49.300 --> 00:34:52.100]   - I just like the size, for us, the phone call.
[00:34:52.100 --> 00:34:54.460]   'Cause a lot of them are overseas,
[00:34:54.460 --> 00:34:55.660]   a lot of our guys use them as phones,
[00:34:55.660 --> 00:34:57.460]   'cause with FaceTime Audio,
[00:34:57.460 --> 00:35:02.260]   a lot of people are just calling out, you know, to save the app.
[00:35:02.260 --> 00:35:04.420]   - Or, of course, you're an outlier once again, sir,
[00:35:04.420 --> 00:35:05.420]   and it doesn't, I mean--
[00:35:05.420 --> 00:35:06.260]   - I know.
[00:35:06.260 --> 00:35:09.620]   - But the other cool thing is that how many apps do we all have
[00:35:09.620 --> 00:35:11.860]   on our phones right now that are used as remote controls
[00:35:11.860 --> 00:35:14.340]   for other interfaces, for other devices we have
[00:35:14.340 --> 00:35:15.940]   in our office and in our house?
[00:35:15.940 --> 00:35:16.780]   - Right.
[00:35:16.780 --> 00:35:18.300]   - So, I would certainly be interested,
[00:35:18.300 --> 00:35:20.100]   I would certainly be interested in buying
[00:35:20.100 --> 00:35:22.180]   a next generation iPod Touch,
[00:35:22.180 --> 00:35:23.900]   if only as this is going to be the device
[00:35:23.900 --> 00:35:25.620]   that will always be my Roku interface,
[00:35:25.620 --> 00:35:27.140]   will always be my cable box interface,
[00:35:27.140 --> 00:35:29.980]   it will always be my sling box interface.
[00:35:29.980 --> 00:35:30.820]   - I mean, that's--
[00:35:30.820 --> 00:35:33.500]   - Most people just say, well, I got the iPhone in my pocket.
[00:35:33.500 --> 00:35:35.180]   Remember, Steve Jobs called the iPhone
[00:35:35.180 --> 00:35:37.420]   the best iPod we've ever made.
[00:35:37.420 --> 00:35:40.260]   When he announced it, when he introduced it, they knew.
[00:35:40.260 --> 00:35:44.300]   In fact, 2009, Oppenheimer on an analyst call said,
[00:35:44.300 --> 00:35:46.220]   we know we're cannibalizing our iPod sales,
[00:35:46.220 --> 00:35:47.380]   that's part of the plan.
[00:35:47.380 --> 00:35:50.100]   That's a core philosophy of Apple.
[00:35:50.100 --> 00:35:52.540]   They believe that the only product that is worthy
[00:35:52.540 --> 00:35:54.460]   of cannibalizing sales of an Apple product
[00:35:54.460 --> 00:35:55.740]   is a newer Apple product.
[00:35:55.740 --> 00:35:57.420]   - Another Apple product.
[00:35:57.420 --> 00:36:00.260]   - And that was the iPhone 5C as well,
[00:36:00.260 --> 00:36:02.940]   'cause it's got the packaging of an iPod now,
[00:36:02.940 --> 00:36:04.940]   it's got the colors of an iPod now,
[00:36:04.940 --> 00:36:07.340]   and it didn't perform with the levels they wanted it to,
[00:36:07.340 --> 00:36:09.860]   but the desire was for that to be the next popular
[00:36:09.860 --> 00:36:11.180]   sort of iOS device.
[00:36:11.180 --> 00:36:13.740]   - Yeah, that's an interesting topic though,
[00:36:13.740 --> 00:36:16.100]   and I'm not creating a conclusion here,
[00:36:16.100 --> 00:36:17.980]   I'm just, I'm legitimately curious about this,
[00:36:17.980 --> 00:36:22.980]   that I wonder if Apple decided to not package the iPhone 5C
[00:36:22.980 --> 00:36:25.660]   as like an iPod-like device,
[00:36:25.660 --> 00:36:29.140]   but made it look as close to the 5S as possible,
[00:36:29.140 --> 00:36:31.900]   is part of what was throwing people the fact that
[00:36:31.900 --> 00:36:34.820]   it will be broadcasting the entire world that, no, no, no,
[00:36:34.820 --> 00:36:38.980]   you don't have the good one, you have the cheap plastic one.
[00:36:38.980 --> 00:36:41.940]   I don't know if Apple users are vulnerable
[00:36:41.940 --> 00:36:44.780]   to that kind of thinking, or if they really do want
[00:36:44.780 --> 00:36:46.700]   the slick nice device,
[00:36:46.700 --> 00:36:49.940]   they don't want to have the iPhone Junior.
[00:36:49.940 --> 00:36:55.540]   - So he said that iPhone 5C represented a smaller,
[00:36:55.540 --> 00:36:59.100]   this is Tim Cook, smaller mix of total handset sales,
[00:36:59.100 --> 00:37:02.420]   it was, demand was different than we thought.
[00:37:02.420 --> 00:37:05.300]   Different. - Different.
[00:37:05.300 --> 00:37:06.900]   - Yeah, I mean, they really thought it was going to be
[00:37:06.900 --> 00:37:08.260]   the popular iPhone, I told them like,
[00:37:08.260 --> 00:37:10.780]   my mom, it's the first phone she ever bought, sorry,
[00:37:10.780 --> 00:37:12.460]   she had a Samsung flip phone before,
[00:37:12.460 --> 00:37:13.700]   it's the first smartphone she ever bought
[00:37:13.700 --> 00:37:15.820]   because you saw the commercial better together
[00:37:15.820 --> 00:37:17.180]   and she thought it was Andy Warhol
[00:37:17.180 --> 00:37:19.100]   and the nicest thing she'd ever seen.
[00:37:19.100 --> 00:37:21.700]   She still thinks it's way better than the iPhone 5S.
[00:37:21.700 --> 00:37:24.420]   And Apple believed that it was going to be the popular iPhone
[00:37:24.420 --> 00:37:25.740]   that people would like the colors
[00:37:25.740 --> 00:37:27.860]   and they'd like the plastic being more durable
[00:37:27.860 --> 00:37:30.540]   and it would be a funner, maybe more kid friendly,
[00:37:30.540 --> 00:37:34.060]   maybe more non-tech savvy person friendly device.
[00:37:34.060 --> 00:37:36.980]   - Do you think the Wall Street Journal got it right?
[00:37:36.980 --> 00:37:42.580]   They claim that this year, Apple scrapped the 5C.
[00:37:43.580 --> 00:37:45.900]   There will be two new iPhone models,
[00:37:45.900 --> 00:37:48.740]   according to the Journal, with larger displays,
[00:37:48.740 --> 00:37:51.540]   one bigger than five inches
[00:37:51.540 --> 00:37:54.020]   and they're not going to be any plastic-backed iPhones
[00:37:54.020 --> 00:37:54.860]   in the lineup.
[00:37:54.860 --> 00:37:59.100]   - The, as far as I know, there's not too bigger iPhones
[00:37:59.100 --> 00:38:01.020]   in the pipeline, there's one.
[00:38:01.020 --> 00:38:02.780]   So I don't know how far they're looking out,
[00:38:02.780 --> 00:38:05.140]   I mean, Apple experiments with all sorts of different sizes
[00:38:05.140 --> 00:38:06.620]   and they could have, you know,
[00:38:06.620 --> 00:38:09.420]   the full range of Samsung sizes in the lab,
[00:38:09.420 --> 00:38:12.540]   but as far as I know, there's one bigger one in the works
[00:38:12.540 --> 00:38:14.180]   and I don't know if they'll scrap the 5C
[00:38:14.180 --> 00:38:17.100]   or they'll still have some device that fills the slot below
[00:38:17.100 --> 00:38:19.060]   whatever the premium iPhone is,
[00:38:19.060 --> 00:38:20.300]   whether plastic didn't work out
[00:38:20.300 --> 00:38:21.380]   and they go back to something else
[00:38:21.380 --> 00:38:23.300]   where they have something completely different in mind
[00:38:23.300 --> 00:38:25.060]   is another story, but instead of looking at them
[00:38:25.060 --> 00:38:27.500]   like certain devices, Apple has certain slots
[00:38:27.500 --> 00:38:28.340]   that they want to fill
[00:38:28.340 --> 00:38:31.260]   and they're usually fairly consistent about those.
[00:38:31.260 --> 00:38:32.100]   - Yeah, I agree.
[00:38:32.100 --> 00:38:33.820]   January is way too early to feel as though
[00:38:33.820 --> 00:38:35.740]   they've got a real beat on what Apple's going to be shipping
[00:38:35.740 --> 00:38:38.540]   in the fall, especially where handsets are concerned.
[00:38:38.540 --> 00:38:39.980]   But yeah, I think that I don't think
[00:38:39.980 --> 00:38:41.820]   there's anybody listening who seriously believes
[00:38:41.820 --> 00:38:43.020]   that Apple is not going to be shipping
[00:38:43.020 --> 00:38:44.700]   a larger screen phone at this point.
[00:38:44.700 --> 00:38:49.220]   If they do not ship a seriously large screen iPhone in 2014,
[00:38:49.220 --> 00:38:53.140]   they will be making a really explicit statement about,
[00:38:53.140 --> 00:38:55.220]   it's not that they don't think the time is right,
[00:38:55.220 --> 00:38:56.780]   it's not as though they believe it's aesthetically
[00:38:56.780 --> 00:38:58.940]   and pleasing, it's not that the infrastructure
[00:38:58.940 --> 00:39:00.980]   and the developer infrastructure isn't there yet,
[00:39:00.980 --> 00:39:03.420]   it's because they fundamentally believe
[00:39:03.420 --> 00:39:06.820]   that a phone should not be larger than this size
[00:39:06.820 --> 00:39:08.860]   and I don't think they believe that.
[00:39:08.860 --> 00:39:09.860]   - And there's a whole bunch of people
[00:39:09.860 --> 00:39:11.900]   for whom the phone is becoming the primary computer,
[00:39:11.900 --> 00:39:14.460]   they don't want a laptop, they don't even want a tablet
[00:39:14.460 --> 00:39:16.860]   and an emerging market might be because they can't afford it,
[00:39:16.860 --> 00:39:18.620]   but in a lot of established markets,
[00:39:18.620 --> 00:39:20.060]   they just don't want to have the inconvenience,
[00:39:20.060 --> 00:39:22.460]   they want to have a device that the phone button is there
[00:39:22.460 --> 00:39:25.060]   but it's not the primary thing that they want to use.
[00:39:25.060 --> 00:39:27.820]   And for them, if Apple's goal is to make
[00:39:27.820 --> 00:39:30.220]   better mainstream products year after year,
[00:39:30.220 --> 00:39:32.980]   it's almost inescapable what the conclusion now is,
[00:39:32.980 --> 00:39:36.300]   a larger screen iPhone would be a better mainstream product,
[00:39:36.300 --> 00:39:38.940]   it would increase their addressable market.
[00:39:38.940 --> 00:39:40.940]   - The analogy I like to draw is the iPhone
[00:39:40.940 --> 00:39:44.220]   used to be on AT&T and you had to choose between AT&T's iPhone
[00:39:44.220 --> 00:39:46.260]   or getting something else on Verizon
[00:39:46.260 --> 00:39:47.740]   and then the iPhone went to Verizon
[00:39:47.740 --> 00:39:48.820]   and he no longer had to choose,
[00:39:48.820 --> 00:39:50.580]   you could get an iPhone on Verizon.
[00:39:50.580 --> 00:39:52.380]   Right now you have to choose between an iPhone
[00:39:52.380 --> 00:39:54.900]   and a larger screen device from another manufacturer
[00:39:54.900 --> 00:39:56.260]   and those are premium devices,
[00:39:56.260 --> 00:39:58.860]   they're not discount budget devices for the most part
[00:39:58.860 --> 00:40:01.140]   and Apple is gonna want people to choose
[00:40:01.140 --> 00:40:03.180]   a larger screen device that is from Apple
[00:40:03.180 --> 00:40:05.500]   if they want to keep that premium segment of the market.
[00:40:05.500 --> 00:40:09.300]   - So the journal says that the four and a half inch model
[00:40:09.300 --> 00:40:10.980]   is further along in development,
[00:40:10.980 --> 00:40:12.660]   according to their sources and is being prepared
[00:40:12.660 --> 00:40:14.700]   for mass production now,
[00:40:14.700 --> 00:40:16.740]   the bigger than five inch,
[00:40:16.740 --> 00:40:18.540]   however much bigger than five inch,
[00:40:18.540 --> 00:40:20.940]   is still in preliminary development.
[00:40:20.940 --> 00:40:23.300]   But you say your sources don't agree with this.
[00:40:23.300 --> 00:40:25.220]   - Well I mean it depends how early preliminary is,
[00:40:25.220 --> 00:40:27.620]   like I said there's all sorts of sizes in the labs,
[00:40:27.620 --> 00:40:29.500]   the fact that one of them is ready
[00:40:29.500 --> 00:40:31.220]   and the other one isn't as much more consistent.
[00:40:31.220 --> 00:40:35.420]   - Do you think Apple will stick to its release cycle
[00:40:35.420 --> 00:40:37.140]   this year or might they,
[00:40:37.140 --> 00:40:40.260]   I mean they're completely capable of changing it up?
[00:40:40.260 --> 00:40:43.140]   - They can release an iPhone or Roli in June
[00:40:43.140 --> 00:40:43.980]   if they want to,
[00:40:43.980 --> 00:40:44.820]   I mean they can do anything they like.
[00:40:44.820 --> 00:40:46.380]   It's the benefit of their model,
[00:40:46.380 --> 00:40:47.220]   they don't pre-announce
[00:40:47.220 --> 00:40:48.980]   and they do all their own stuff,
[00:40:48.980 --> 00:40:51.220]   but it makes sense given the market conditions
[00:40:51.220 --> 00:40:53.660]   that they have that they'll want to stick to a fairly,
[00:40:53.660 --> 00:40:55.100]   I mean they'll change it if they have to,
[00:40:55.100 --> 00:40:56.140]   they might even change it just to be
[00:40:56.140 --> 00:40:58.420]   a little bit renegade in Rogue once in a while,
[00:40:58.420 --> 00:41:00.980]   or if the previous device was not great,
[00:41:00.980 --> 00:41:01.900]   like an iPad 3,
[00:41:01.900 --> 00:41:04.580]   an iPad 4, six months later,
[00:41:04.580 --> 00:41:05.900]   but all of the things being equal,
[00:41:05.900 --> 00:41:07.580]   they're usually pretty good on their yearly.
[00:41:07.580 --> 00:41:09.540]   - You don't think that the disappointing results
[00:41:09.540 --> 00:41:11.060]   with the 5C are enough reason
[00:41:11.060 --> 00:41:13.260]   for them to do something different sooner.
[00:41:13.260 --> 00:41:14.780]   - Do we know if the 5C sold worse
[00:41:14.780 --> 00:41:16.700]   than if the 5 had been down $100
[00:41:16.700 --> 00:41:18.180]   or compared to what the 4S sold,
[00:41:18.180 --> 00:41:19.180]   I mean we don't know what those results are.
[00:41:19.180 --> 00:41:20.380]   - They break down those numbers, right?
[00:41:20.380 --> 00:41:21.980]   They have no idea.
[00:41:21.980 --> 00:41:23.180]   It's different people,
[00:41:23.180 --> 00:41:25.380]   there's still people coming in to buy iPhone 5S's
[00:41:25.380 --> 00:41:27.100]   and on that basis there is not a problem
[00:41:27.100 --> 00:41:28.100]   that Apple needs to solve
[00:41:28.100 --> 00:41:29.580]   and earlier phone release.
[00:41:29.580 --> 00:41:33.660]   - Apple did pay up $2 billion to developers
[00:41:33.660 --> 00:41:34.660]   in the first quarter.
[00:41:34.660 --> 00:41:37.660]   That's a nice chunk of change.
[00:41:37.660 --> 00:41:40.700]   - It was amazing how their message over and over again
[00:41:40.700 --> 00:41:42.140]   was that we are number one.
[00:41:42.140 --> 00:41:44.140]   I mean like they said that iOS 7
[00:41:44.140 --> 00:41:45.900]   is the most popular operating system,
[00:41:45.900 --> 00:41:47.460]   we're paying out the most to developers,
[00:41:47.460 --> 00:41:49.620]   we have the highest usage demographics,
[00:41:49.620 --> 00:41:51.740]   more people are shopping on the iPhone.
[00:41:51.740 --> 00:41:52.860]   It was over and over again,
[00:41:52.860 --> 00:41:54.260]   they hammered the fact that,
[00:41:54.260 --> 00:41:55.660]   I don't wanna say it was elitist saying
[00:41:55.660 --> 00:41:58.380]   that our customers are better than Android customers,
[00:41:58.380 --> 00:41:59.460]   but they were making the argument
[00:41:59.460 --> 00:42:01.540]   that value is to be had on the iPhone platform.
[00:42:01.540 --> 00:42:02.980]   - Who is that message for?
[00:42:02.980 --> 00:42:04.420]   Is that for developers, that message?
[00:42:04.420 --> 00:42:05.260]   Is it for?
[00:42:05.260 --> 00:42:06.500]   - At WWDC is for developers,
[00:42:06.500 --> 00:42:07.900]   at these calls it's for investors.
[00:42:07.900 --> 00:42:09.060]   - It's for investors.
[00:42:09.060 --> 00:42:09.900]   - Well and I think that also--
[00:42:09.900 --> 00:42:11.900]   - Does Apple think it's important to get that message
[00:42:11.900 --> 00:42:14.500]   to consumers where number one?
[00:42:14.500 --> 00:42:16.420]   - No, I don't know if the consumer needs to know,
[00:42:16.420 --> 00:42:17.660]   but I do think that it is important
[00:42:17.660 --> 00:42:19.820]   for them to distinguish raw sales numbers
[00:42:19.820 --> 00:42:21.860]   from actual impact.
[00:42:21.860 --> 00:42:23.420]   So I think that that's definitely something
[00:42:23.420 --> 00:42:24.740]   that they were trying to distinguish there
[00:42:24.740 --> 00:42:28.220]   is that we get that a lot of people are buying androids,
[00:42:28.220 --> 00:42:31.340]   but when you actually look at their usage rates,
[00:42:31.340 --> 00:42:33.260]   their how many apps they're buying,
[00:42:33.260 --> 00:42:34.060]   all those other things,
[00:42:34.060 --> 00:42:37.820]   then the iPhone or the iOS environment
[00:42:37.820 --> 00:42:41.140]   still is superior according to them.
[00:42:41.140 --> 00:42:41.980]   - We're number one.
[00:42:41.980 --> 00:42:43.380]   - Number one, where it counts?
[00:42:43.380 --> 00:42:46.340]   - I've always felt it's a really odd metric
[00:42:46.340 --> 00:42:48.140]   for them to really trump it,
[00:42:48.140 --> 00:42:51.540]   because for one piece of snake oil,
[00:42:51.540 --> 00:42:54.780]   and the announcement talked about the single digit
[00:42:54.780 --> 00:42:57.300]   or lower than single digit adoption rate
[00:42:57.300 --> 00:42:59.340]   for Android KitKat,
[00:42:59.340 --> 00:43:02.180]   which requires that the last risk in that footnote says,
[00:43:02.180 --> 00:43:03.620]   yeah, it's not available.
[00:43:03.620 --> 00:43:06.100]   It's only available for Google branded devices yet,
[00:43:06.100 --> 00:43:08.980]   which isn't itself a very, very tiny sliver of the market
[00:43:08.980 --> 00:43:09.860]   when they release the code
[00:43:09.860 --> 00:43:11.660]   and make it available for the entire marketplace.
[00:43:11.660 --> 00:43:13.300]   And then you start to look at that.
[00:43:13.300 --> 00:43:16.220]   But I don't think they've really made the point of here,
[00:43:16.220 --> 00:43:19.060]   we're giving you lots of numbers that hopefully tell you
[00:43:19.060 --> 00:43:21.220]   that there are more people using our devices
[00:43:21.220 --> 00:43:22.220]   and other devices.
[00:43:22.220 --> 00:43:23.900]   I don't think they're making the statement of here's
[00:43:23.900 --> 00:43:27.940]   why it makes our brand more valuable to you, the investor,
[00:43:27.940 --> 00:43:31.220]   or how it makes our devices more useful to you, the user.
[00:43:31.220 --> 00:43:34.740]   Because it's nice to see how many billions of dollars
[00:43:34.740 --> 00:43:35.740]   are being paid to developers,
[00:43:35.740 --> 00:43:39.540]   but is it indicative of a huge app marketplace
[00:43:39.540 --> 00:43:41.980]   in which there are hundreds and hundreds of thousands
[00:43:41.980 --> 00:43:43.060]   of valuable apps,
[00:43:43.060 --> 00:43:45.340]   or does it mean that a few game developers
[00:43:45.340 --> 00:43:47.740]   that essentially know how to build a nice phone-based
[00:43:47.740 --> 00:43:52.700]   slot machine, sometimes in the guys of a Smurf Bay game
[00:43:52.700 --> 00:43:54.260]   or a Simpsons game,
[00:43:54.260 --> 00:43:57.420]   or is it just something as simple as that?
[00:43:57.420 --> 00:44:01.180]   So it is more than a 300% growth over this time last year
[00:44:01.180 --> 00:44:02.180]   paid out to developers.
[00:44:02.180 --> 00:44:03.580]   That's a big jump.
[00:44:03.580 --> 00:44:06.540]   - Again, I just think, okay, nice for the developers,
[00:44:06.540 --> 00:44:08.780]   but they don't, I think that,
[00:44:08.780 --> 00:44:10.140]   and I realize this is an analyst call,
[00:44:10.140 --> 00:44:11.780]   this is not an Apple commercial,
[00:44:11.780 --> 00:44:13.660]   but a lot of people are going to be writing coverage
[00:44:13.660 --> 00:44:14.500]   based on that,
[00:44:14.500 --> 00:44:16.020]   I'm driving their own conclusions based on that.
[00:44:16.020 --> 00:44:19.700]   So I think that I wish that Apple would spend some time
[00:44:19.700 --> 00:44:22.460]   really communicating how that benefits people
[00:44:22.460 --> 00:44:24.060]   who have money in their pocket
[00:44:24.060 --> 00:44:25.580]   and they want to spend it in an Apple store.
[00:44:25.580 --> 00:44:28.220]   Here's the consumer number that you will care about.
[00:44:28.220 --> 00:44:30.220]   92% credit over a recent survey,
[00:44:30.220 --> 00:44:34.940]   92% of Apple revenue comes from in-app purchases,
[00:44:34.940 --> 00:44:36.660]   free apps with in-app purchases,
[00:44:36.660 --> 00:44:38.300]   4% paid apps,
[00:44:38.300 --> 00:44:42.020]   and they're remaining 4% from apps with--
[00:44:42.020 --> 00:44:43.140]   - Which I think is amazing,
[00:44:43.140 --> 00:44:46.100]   'cause the whole freemium thing drives me crazy.
[00:44:46.100 --> 00:44:47.820]   - Yeah, but apparently it's the way to make money,
[00:44:47.820 --> 00:44:49.140]   that's what you want to do.
[00:44:49.140 --> 00:44:50.860]   - Like I stopped playing plants versus zombies,
[00:44:50.860 --> 00:44:52.180]   it was too much.
[00:44:52.180 --> 00:44:53.020]   It was like, you know,
[00:44:53.020 --> 00:44:54.820]   but the in-app purchase for field runners
[00:44:54.820 --> 00:44:56.260]   doesn't bother me at all, I don't know why,
[00:44:56.260 --> 00:44:57.260]   but I mean, the field runners want it,
[00:44:57.260 --> 00:44:59.140]   it's like, oh, I want to get some extra
[00:44:59.140 --> 00:45:01.660]   whatever that I want to use.
[00:45:01.660 --> 00:45:03.140]   But the way that they implemented it,
[00:45:03.140 --> 00:45:04.860]   I think in something like plants versus zombies,
[00:45:04.860 --> 00:45:06.300]   as I said, was a total turn off.
[00:45:06.300 --> 00:45:07.980]   - You can't turn your back though,
[00:45:07.980 --> 00:45:10.580]   if 92% of all the money Apple makes
[00:45:10.580 --> 00:45:13.420]   is coming from premium in that.
[00:45:13.420 --> 00:45:14.820]   - So that could be changing that model anytime.
[00:45:14.820 --> 00:45:16.340]   - That could change.
[00:45:16.340 --> 00:45:17.180]   No, not at all.
[00:45:17.180 --> 00:45:18.020]   - But you're right, I think the key is
[00:45:18.020 --> 00:45:20.340]   to make it palatable for end users,
[00:45:20.340 --> 00:45:21.900]   not to feel like they're a cash machine.
[00:45:21.900 --> 00:45:22.740]   - And it definitely looks like,
[00:45:22.740 --> 00:45:24.700]   'cause we're about to move much more
[00:45:24.700 --> 00:45:26.060]   heavily into software development.
[00:45:26.060 --> 00:45:27.300]   When we do some software development,
[00:45:27.300 --> 00:45:29.860]   we just hired a good programmer
[00:45:29.860 --> 00:45:31.260]   and we're gonna be doing a lot more of that.
[00:45:31.260 --> 00:45:33.660]   And we're definitely, as we think about the structure
[00:45:33.660 --> 00:45:35.060]   of how we're building it,
[00:45:35.060 --> 00:45:39.820]   that kind of data has really affected it.
[00:45:39.820 --> 00:45:42.180]   Like, oh, we're gonna build one really cool core app
[00:45:42.180 --> 00:45:43.540]   and then we're gonna add things to it.
[00:45:43.540 --> 00:45:45.740]   And then people can basically all like heart,
[00:45:45.740 --> 00:45:47.260]   the things that they think that are important
[00:45:47.260 --> 00:45:48.460]   are based on what we're doing.
[00:45:48.460 --> 00:45:53.060]   So I do think that it has definitely affected
[00:45:53.060 --> 00:45:55.620]   the way a lot of developers think, including myself.
[00:45:55.620 --> 00:45:57.180]   - We don't do our own Twitter apps.
[00:45:57.180 --> 00:45:59.900]   We rely on the kindness of strangers.
[00:45:59.900 --> 00:46:02.980]   But if I were Houdini 7 or one of the developers
[00:46:02.980 --> 00:46:03.820]   who develops Twitter apps,
[00:46:03.820 --> 00:46:05.780]   I would give the app away and charge,
[00:46:05.780 --> 00:46:09.340]   like maybe, hey, for a buck, you can get bundles.
[00:46:09.340 --> 00:46:11.100]   Be like a cable company.
[00:46:11.100 --> 00:46:13.020]   You want the Mac bundle, you get i5,
[00:46:13.020 --> 00:46:15.540]   Mac break weekly, an iPad today.
[00:46:15.540 --> 00:46:17.180]   You want, you know, like that.
[00:46:17.180 --> 00:46:19.060]   - It's interesting.
[00:46:19.060 --> 00:46:21.100]   I mean, one thing I think they gave out those numbers
[00:46:21.100 --> 00:46:22.500]   because there's a lot of market share numbers
[00:46:22.500 --> 00:46:24.340]   floating around about how Android is so massive
[00:46:24.340 --> 00:46:27.420]   that developers will inevitably turn towards Android first.
[00:46:27.420 --> 00:46:29.100]   And they made the comment over and over again
[00:46:29.100 --> 00:46:31.420]   that games are launching on iPhone still
[00:46:31.420 --> 00:46:33.620]   and exclusive games like clumsy ninja doing well,
[00:46:33.620 --> 00:46:36.420]   but also plans versus zombie had their biggest launch ever
[00:46:36.420 --> 00:46:37.940]   as an iPhone exclusive.
[00:46:37.940 --> 00:46:39.260]   And for the in-app purchase stuff,
[00:46:39.260 --> 00:46:41.180]   I mean, that's all of our fault.
[00:46:41.180 --> 00:46:42.500]   Developers race to the bottom.
[00:46:42.500 --> 00:46:44.660]   We said we wouldn't pay $10 for an app.
[00:46:44.660 --> 00:46:45.740]   We said we wouldn't give you, you know,
[00:46:45.740 --> 00:46:47.620]   even $5 for a racing game,
[00:46:47.620 --> 00:46:49.420]   but boy, we'll give you $100
[00:46:49.420 --> 00:46:52.140]   if you let us get our cars back on the track faster.
[00:46:52.140 --> 00:46:53.940]   You know what I pay five bucks for?
[00:46:53.940 --> 00:46:56.260]   No NSA back door in my angry birds.
[00:46:56.260 --> 00:46:58.220]   I think that would be nice.
[00:46:58.220 --> 00:46:59.060]   How about that? - They didn't buy that.
[00:46:59.060 --> 00:47:01.380]   - How about that? - They didn't buy that.
[00:47:01.380 --> 00:47:03.140]   - How about, did you see that?
[00:47:03.140 --> 00:47:04.900]   - They denied that this morning.
[00:47:04.900 --> 00:47:06.460]   - I had a hard time figuring out exactly
[00:47:06.460 --> 00:47:07.700]   how that was implemented.
[00:47:07.700 --> 00:47:10.900]   - According to this, this is another Snowden link,
[00:47:10.900 --> 00:47:13.740]   coming out from the Guardian.
[00:47:13.740 --> 00:47:16.420]   US and UK, they include the GCHQ in this,
[00:47:16.420 --> 00:47:18.100]   the UK Spy Agency.
[00:47:18.100 --> 00:47:23.100]   Piggyback on apps, they specifically called out angry birds
[00:47:23.100 --> 00:47:27.300]   and Google Maps, the data pouring onto communication networks
[00:47:27.300 --> 00:47:29.380]   from the new generation of iPhone and Android apps
[00:47:29.380 --> 00:47:32.700]   ranges from phone model and screen size
[00:47:32.700 --> 00:47:35.660]   to personal detail like age, gender and location.
[00:47:35.660 --> 00:47:37.860]   Some apps, according to the leak
[00:47:37.860 --> 00:47:40.580]   can share users most sensitive information,
[00:47:40.580 --> 00:47:44.340]   sexual orientation, sexual preferences,
[00:47:44.340 --> 00:47:46.700]   political beliefs.
[00:47:46.700 --> 00:47:49.140]   What's not clear is this a backdoor
[00:47:49.140 --> 00:47:50.900]   in the apps of Rovio denied it.
[00:47:50.900 --> 00:47:51.980]   - Yeah, I know it's a party. - Sure Google went,
[00:47:51.980 --> 00:47:53.740]   what are you crazy?
[00:47:53.740 --> 00:47:56.660]   But maybe they're tapping into the data
[00:47:56.660 --> 00:47:58.380]   coming out of the apps somehow.
[00:47:58.380 --> 00:48:00.980]   - Rovio said it might be a third party advertiser
[00:48:00.980 --> 00:48:02.420]   that they're plugging into.
[00:48:02.420 --> 00:48:03.860]   - Yeah.
[00:48:03.860 --> 00:48:06.580]   I think that really points to what we really need
[00:48:06.580 --> 00:48:09.940]   is federal legislation identifying
[00:48:09.940 --> 00:48:12.100]   what kind of ownership you have over the information
[00:48:12.100 --> 00:48:14.140]   you're generating with your phone.
[00:48:14.140 --> 00:48:15.740]   It's such a broad spread problem.
[00:48:15.740 --> 00:48:17.900]   It could be exploited by so many different people.
[00:48:17.900 --> 00:48:21.780]   And there's so little downside to an app manufacturer
[00:48:21.780 --> 00:48:24.620]   putting this sort of stuff into their apps
[00:48:24.620 --> 00:48:27.020]   that the only thing that's gonna stop them
[00:48:27.020 --> 00:48:29.380]   is there is a law saying that you have to have
[00:48:29.380 --> 00:48:31.740]   an explicit warning, you have to have explicit controls
[00:48:31.740 --> 00:48:34.260]   and you have to have an easily discoverable page
[00:48:34.260 --> 00:48:36.700]   that says here are switches for each piece of information
[00:48:36.700 --> 00:48:37.780]   that we're trying to collect from you,
[00:48:37.780 --> 00:48:39.500]   you can turn it on, you can turn it off.
[00:48:39.500 --> 00:48:41.340]   And we will of course default it on,
[00:48:41.340 --> 00:48:43.500]   but when you install it, we told you that this is,
[00:48:43.500 --> 00:48:45.820]   here's where this page isn't, here's how to get it.
[00:48:45.820 --> 00:48:48.940]   - Did you see the golden nugget slide?
[00:48:48.940 --> 00:48:50.180]   This is, look at this slide.
[00:48:50.180 --> 00:48:51.020]   - It's a comprehensive one.
[00:48:51.020 --> 00:48:53.260]   - Golden nugget exclamation mark.
[00:48:53.260 --> 00:48:54.300]   Top secret by the way,
[00:48:54.300 --> 00:48:56.700]   common tell, Rell to US, F-E-Y.
[00:48:56.700 --> 00:48:59.060]   Perfect scenario, target uploading photo
[00:48:59.060 --> 00:49:01.620]   to a social media site taken with a mobile device.
[00:49:01.620 --> 00:49:03.700]   What can we get?
[00:49:03.700 --> 00:49:06.060]   - Oh, my God.
[00:49:06.060 --> 00:49:07.780]   - Including the paid for that clip art.
[00:49:07.780 --> 00:49:08.860]   - That clip art.
[00:49:11.660 --> 00:49:14.820]   - Oh, that's what I think that one of the things
[00:49:14.820 --> 00:49:17.980]   that is always eye opening for me is when you have
[00:49:17.980 --> 00:49:20.380]   something else and you sign in via G+ or whatever.
[00:49:20.380 --> 00:49:23.020]   So as an example, into an app.
[00:49:23.020 --> 00:49:25.860]   And then what does happen with G+ is of course,
[00:49:25.860 --> 00:49:27.660]   you get this whole list of what,
[00:49:27.660 --> 00:49:30.060]   this is what I'm willing to give this app.
[00:49:30.060 --> 00:49:31.740]   And immediately I go in, I go, no,
[00:49:31.740 --> 00:49:33.100]   you can't have all my contacts.
[00:49:33.100 --> 00:49:34.620]   - You know, like there's no reason for this app.
[00:49:34.620 --> 00:49:36.380]   I have all the information.
[00:49:36.380 --> 00:49:37.220]   You can't have all my contacts.
[00:49:37.220 --> 00:49:39.700]   - How are we gonna find your friends, Mr. Lindsey?
[00:49:39.700 --> 00:49:40.540]   - Exactly.
[00:49:40.540 --> 00:49:42.500]   - So I go through there and turn everything off.
[00:49:42.500 --> 00:49:44.380]   And sometimes they make it pretty manual
[00:49:44.380 --> 00:49:45.660]   to turn it all off.
[00:49:45.660 --> 00:49:49.420]   But I think that I do like that interface,
[00:49:49.420 --> 00:49:52.340]   that it tells me, okay, we're gonna tie into this.
[00:49:52.340 --> 00:49:54.380]   And there are some things that are useful to tie into
[00:49:54.380 --> 00:49:55.820]   and a lot of things that are not.
[00:49:55.820 --> 00:49:58.100]   And I wanna make that choice as the user.
[00:49:58.100 --> 00:49:58.940]   - Yeah.
[00:49:58.940 --> 00:50:00.420]   - I've been, I'm sorry, go ahead.
[00:50:00.420 --> 00:50:01.260]   - I'm sorry, running, go ahead.
[00:50:01.260 --> 00:50:02.940]   - I was just gonna say, John Syracuse recently said
[00:50:02.940 --> 00:50:05.220]   that he would like to see like HIPAA style guidelines
[00:50:05.220 --> 00:50:07.420]   for personal information where it can only be used
[00:50:07.420 --> 00:50:09.300]   for your benefit and if it used for anything else,
[00:50:09.300 --> 00:50:10.700]   it has to be a lot of disclosure.
[00:50:10.700 --> 00:50:13.300]   But also the penalties have to be severe enough
[00:50:13.300 --> 00:50:16.300]   that the app manufacturer or the service provider
[00:50:16.300 --> 00:50:17.780]   cares when they get discovered.
[00:50:17.780 --> 00:50:19.020]   'Cause it was just a small fine.
[00:50:19.020 --> 00:50:21.580]   That's a tiny percentage of the income they derive
[00:50:21.580 --> 00:50:22.580]   from exploiting it then.
[00:50:22.580 --> 00:50:25.900]   And no rules, same as those kind of rules.
[00:50:25.900 --> 00:50:29.340]   - But I think I've been, we've been talking sometimes
[00:50:29.340 --> 00:50:32.780]   about the new rash of Apple ads that have been more vague
[00:50:32.780 --> 00:50:36.660]   and more, you know, Zephyr's hovering in the mist
[00:50:36.660 --> 00:50:40.340]   while chasing after, she had chased after elves
[00:50:40.340 --> 00:50:43.020]   with while holding an iPhone sort of stuff.
[00:50:43.020 --> 00:50:46.100]   I don't dislike these ads, but I look at a situation
[00:50:46.100 --> 00:50:48.580]   like this and it's saying, "Oh, Apple put out an ad
[00:50:48.580 --> 00:50:51.380]   "that says here is how secure the iPhone is."
[00:50:51.380 --> 00:50:53.780]   And here's how hard it is for an application
[00:50:53.780 --> 00:50:56.300]   to get access to data that you have told it not to get access
[00:50:56.300 --> 00:50:57.140]   to. - That would be great.
[00:50:57.140 --> 00:50:58.540]   - I really wanna see more ads like,
[00:50:58.540 --> 00:51:01.500]   'cause that's still something that Apple can absolutely
[00:51:01.500 --> 00:51:03.380]   kick everybody else's butt on.
[00:51:03.380 --> 00:51:06.260]   And it's not something that they put in as a response
[00:51:06.260 --> 00:51:10.060]   to NSA Snowden's disclosure.
[00:51:10.060 --> 00:51:12.380]   It's something they did simply because that is the philosophy
[00:51:12.380 --> 00:51:13.220]   of the company.
[00:51:13.220 --> 00:51:16.140]   We want to work for the best interest of the user
[00:51:16.140 --> 00:51:17.580]   and for nobody else.
[00:51:17.580 --> 00:51:19.860]   And we have set up our company so that we make our money
[00:51:19.860 --> 00:51:21.140]   from the users and nobody else.
[00:51:21.140 --> 00:51:22.540]   So we're gonna be protecting the users
[00:51:22.540 --> 00:51:24.260]   and nobody more important than them.
[00:51:24.260 --> 00:51:26.260]   So I would like to see more stuff like that.
[00:51:26.260 --> 00:51:28.420]   - Tim Cook said that, well, it was really passionate
[00:51:28.420 --> 00:51:29.700]   at least when he did the ABC interview
[00:51:29.700 --> 00:51:31.700]   and he said that you'd have to carry it out in boxes
[00:51:31.700 --> 00:51:33.500]   if you wanted to get their servers.
[00:51:33.500 --> 00:51:36.860]   - It's a hyperbolic statement to make,
[00:51:36.860 --> 00:51:38.180]   but there's a lot of people at Apple that you--
[00:51:38.180 --> 00:51:39.580]   - And to say, good to know.
[00:51:39.580 --> 00:51:40.660]   (laughing)
[00:51:40.660 --> 00:51:43.020]   - We'll bring the boxes next time.
[00:51:43.020 --> 00:51:45.860]   - Really passionately and they're not any happier
[00:51:45.860 --> 00:51:47.460]   than we are about these kinds of rumors
[00:51:47.460 --> 00:51:49.340]   and they would probably make it their life's work
[00:51:49.340 --> 00:51:50.820]   to make it inaccessible.
[00:51:50.820 --> 00:51:52.060]   And I think Andy's absolutely right.
[00:51:52.060 --> 00:51:54.640]   They should market that as a differentiator.
[00:51:54.640 --> 00:51:56.960]   - I agree.
[00:51:56.960 --> 00:51:58.980]   And there are some people who would say,
[00:51:58.980 --> 00:52:01.940]   oh, they protest too much, they're in cahoots.
[00:52:01.940 --> 00:52:03.180]   But I believe them.
[00:52:03.180 --> 00:52:05.380]   They seem to be pretty incensed about the whole thing.
[00:52:05.380 --> 00:52:08.100]   - There is no company I trust more than Apple,
[00:52:08.100 --> 00:52:09.780]   which means I don't have blind trust in them.
[00:52:09.780 --> 00:52:11.380]   But if there was one company that I believe
[00:52:11.380 --> 00:52:13.780]   is gonna defend my data and my interest,
[00:52:13.780 --> 00:52:16.220]   it's going to be Apple and not another company.
[00:52:16.220 --> 00:52:18.460]   - And it's hard to walk back the things they've said now.
[00:52:18.460 --> 00:52:21.660]   Like it would fundamentally alter the nature
[00:52:21.660 --> 00:52:22.500]   of my relationship with Apple
[00:52:22.500 --> 00:52:24.900]   if they turned out to be lying about any of these things.
[00:52:24.900 --> 00:52:29.500]   - Our show today brought to you by LegalZoom.com.
[00:52:29.500 --> 00:52:33.500]   I want you to visit LegalZoom to save on your legal needs.
[00:52:33.500 --> 00:52:34.820]   And if you need a lawyer,
[00:52:34.820 --> 00:52:37.100]   you can even get a lawyer through LegalZoom.
[00:52:37.100 --> 00:52:39.260]   There's some things like starting a business,
[00:52:39.260 --> 00:52:41.860]   protecting your family with a will.
[00:52:41.860 --> 00:52:43.780]   They're not like your other New Year's resolutions.
[00:52:43.780 --> 00:52:45.020]   You can't afford to blow them off.
[00:52:45.020 --> 00:52:46.380]   You should be doing them.
[00:52:46.380 --> 00:52:48.820]   And you probably shouldn't be doing it
[00:52:48.820 --> 00:52:50.540]   on the back of an envelope.
[00:52:50.540 --> 00:52:54.980]   So, yeah, okay, it's fine to say I'm gonna snack less,
[00:52:54.980 --> 00:52:56.060]   I'm gonna exercise more,
[00:52:56.060 --> 00:52:58.820]   but you really ought to also think about incorporating
[00:52:58.820 --> 00:53:00.700]   or forming an LLC for your new startup.
[00:53:00.700 --> 00:53:02.380]   You gotta protect yourself.
[00:53:02.380 --> 00:53:05.140]   They've got a simple questionnaire at LegalZoom.com.
[00:53:05.140 --> 00:53:10.140]   Starts at $99 and over 1 million entrepreneurs have done it.
[00:53:10.140 --> 00:53:11.820]   You know what I like about LegalZoom?
[00:53:11.820 --> 00:53:14.380]   Besides the fact that I like them and I use them.
[00:53:14.380 --> 00:53:16.780]   90% of the customers like me who use LegalZoom
[00:53:16.780 --> 00:53:19.140]   recommend it to family and friends.
[00:53:19.140 --> 00:53:23.420]   A will, $69, or even a living trust.
[00:53:23.420 --> 00:53:24.660]   You don't need a lawyer to do this.
[00:53:24.660 --> 00:53:25.860]   It's quick, it's easy.
[00:53:25.860 --> 00:53:27.980]   You'll get peace of mind and you'll get protection.
[00:53:27.980 --> 00:53:30.300]   No surprise fees, no hassles, no headaches.
[00:53:30.300 --> 00:53:32.260]   LegalZoom step-by-step process was created
[00:53:32.260 --> 00:53:35.060]   by a team of experts in law and technology.
[00:53:35.060 --> 00:53:37.340]   Now, I wanna tell you, they're not a law firm,
[00:53:37.340 --> 00:53:38.860]   but they do connect you if you need it
[00:53:38.860 --> 00:53:40.980]   with third party attorneys.
[00:53:40.980 --> 00:53:44.100]   You can see the profiles and the reviews of the attorney
[00:53:44.100 --> 00:53:47.940]   before you sign up and it's a pre-negotiated flat rate.
[00:53:47.940 --> 00:53:50.660]   So, they'll help you with their self-help services.
[00:53:50.660 --> 00:53:52.780]   From wills to business formations,
[00:53:52.780 --> 00:53:54.180]   trademarks and powers of attorney

[00:54:20.340 --> 00:54:23.420]   is here and Hanocco Zomannack on the 5x5 network,
[00:54:23.420 --> 00:54:25.380]   5x5.tv.
[00:54:25.380 --> 00:54:26.820]   ReneeRitchie, iMore.com.
[00:54:26.820 --> 00:54:29.180]   He does like eight million other podcasts
[00:54:29.180 --> 00:54:31.020]   at the iMore network.
[00:54:31.020 --> 00:54:33.220]   And good stuff, some very interesting interviews
[00:54:33.220 --> 00:54:36.700]   and so forth, really well worth checking out iMore.com.
[00:54:36.700 --> 00:54:40.620]   And of course, Alex Lindsey, whose work is so secret,
[00:54:40.620 --> 00:54:42.060]   we cannot even mention it.
[00:54:42.060 --> 00:54:46.060]   But I just wanna point out he's in Washington DC
[00:54:46.060 --> 00:54:48.740]   with a perfect connection to the internet.
[00:54:48.740 --> 00:54:49.580]   - Oh.
[00:54:49.580 --> 00:54:51.740]   - So, is that where they're editing "Star Wars 7?"
[00:54:51.740 --> 00:54:52.580]   - Interesting.
[00:54:52.580 --> 00:54:53.580]   - That's what he says.
[00:54:53.580 --> 00:54:54.900]   - It turns out they were thinking,
[00:54:54.900 --> 00:54:55.780]   they were talking about,
[00:54:55.780 --> 00:54:57.220]   "Let's do "Star Wars" in LA."
[00:54:57.220 --> 00:54:58.780]   And I was like, "Why don't we do it in Washington DC?
[00:54:58.780 --> 00:54:59.980]   "I'm on the fiber here."
[00:54:59.980 --> 00:55:01.780]   - It's the natural place.
[00:55:01.780 --> 00:55:04.020]   - It's only two steps away from chorus kind of,
[00:55:04.020 --> 00:55:07.420]   in terms of political, you know, opulence.
[00:55:07.420 --> 00:55:09.140]   - And, you know, why not make it easier
[00:55:09.140 --> 00:55:10.820]   for the NSA to spy on you, right?
[00:55:10.820 --> 00:55:11.660]   - Exactly.
[00:55:11.660 --> 00:55:13.340]   - Embrace our new overlords.
[00:55:13.340 --> 00:55:14.780]   - They're hyped down the street.
[00:55:14.780 --> 00:55:18.260]   - Apple's pushing deeper into mobile payments,
[00:55:18.260 --> 00:55:20.900]   another Wall Street Journal article,
[00:55:20.900 --> 00:55:24.580]   physical goods, eddy-q,
[00:55:24.580 --> 00:55:26.940]   and is meeting with industry executives
[00:55:26.940 --> 00:55:29.500]   to discuss Apple's interest in handling payments
[00:55:29.500 --> 00:55:32.660]   for physical goods and services on its devices.
[00:55:32.660 --> 00:55:37.300]   Jennifer Bailey, who runs the online stores,
[00:55:37.300 --> 00:55:40.980]   has moved into a new role to build a payment business
[00:55:40.980 --> 00:55:42.940]   within Apple, according to three people,
[00:55:42.940 --> 00:55:44.660]   not one, not two, but three people
[00:55:44.660 --> 00:55:45.860]   with knowledge of the move.
[00:55:45.860 --> 00:55:51.160]   Miss Bailey did not comment.
[00:55:52.260 --> 00:55:56.980]   So, you know, Apple is sat on this passport for a while.
[00:55:56.980 --> 00:55:58.340]   What is it called?
[00:55:58.340 --> 00:55:59.980]   - Passbook. - Passbook.
[00:55:59.980 --> 00:56:02.220]   I don't even use it, nobody uses it,
[00:56:02.220 --> 00:56:03.060]   'cause it's got stuff in it,
[00:56:03.060 --> 00:56:04.500]   it's like your Starbucks card in there,
[00:56:04.500 --> 00:56:05.420]   but you can't really use it.
[00:56:05.420 --> 00:56:06.980]   - You can use it for-- - Huh?
[00:56:06.980 --> 00:56:09.020]   - I use it for porting passes,
[00:56:09.020 --> 00:56:11.140]   for Starbucks, for movie tickets.
[00:56:11.140 --> 00:56:12.460]   - Yeah.
[00:56:12.460 --> 00:56:14.260]   - It's not living up to its potential
[00:56:14.260 --> 00:56:18.380]   until you can pay for it, stuff with it, right?
[00:56:18.380 --> 00:56:19.460]   - I agree.
[00:56:19.460 --> 00:56:20.300]   - I agree.
[00:56:20.300 --> 00:56:21.140]   - Well, this--
[00:56:21.140 --> 00:56:22.100]   - I would love to pay with my iPhone.
[00:56:22.100 --> 00:56:22.940]   - Yeah.
[00:56:22.940 --> 00:56:23.780]   - Yeah.
[00:56:23.780 --> 00:56:25.340]   - I think, again, back to what we were talking about,
[00:56:25.340 --> 00:56:26.180]   a little bit earlier, I mean,
[00:56:26.180 --> 00:56:27.500]   there is no company that is,
[00:56:27.500 --> 00:56:29.820]   I think is, at this point, more trusted than Apple.
[00:56:29.820 --> 00:56:33.060]   And so that if anyone, if Google's,
[00:56:33.060 --> 00:56:35.020]   when Google started Google Wallet,
[00:56:35.020 --> 00:56:37.220]   that's, there's gonna be some amount of trepidation
[00:56:37.220 --> 00:56:39.660]   about what happens to the information that I'm giving you.
[00:56:39.660 --> 00:56:41.220]   Another company, you'd be some trep-,
[00:56:41.220 --> 00:56:42.420]   there'd be some trepidation about,
[00:56:42.420 --> 00:56:45.020]   I'm really not sure I want to give you access
[00:56:45.020 --> 00:56:47.220]   to my bank accounts, 'cause I don't know
[00:56:47.220 --> 00:56:49.820]   if you're really secure, but if Apple decided
[00:56:49.820 --> 00:56:51.340]   to be a go-between between my bank
[00:56:51.340 --> 00:56:53.820]   and anybody else I wanted to do business with,
[00:56:53.820 --> 00:56:56.100]   that would be fascinating to me.
[00:56:56.100 --> 00:56:57.220]   And I don't think there's another company
[00:56:57.220 --> 00:56:58.460]   that would be as capable.
[00:56:58.460 --> 00:57:00.780]   - Well, and they're also leaving money on the table.
[00:57:00.780 --> 00:57:03.940]   I mean, you can book an Uber car,
[00:57:03.940 --> 00:57:06.420]   have it come to you, pay for it all within your iPhone,
[00:57:06.420 --> 00:57:07.540]   but none of that money goes to Apple,
[00:57:07.540 --> 00:57:09.940]   'cause it's all in the Uber app.
[00:57:09.940 --> 00:57:11.860]   It would be a convenience for Uber,
[00:57:11.860 --> 00:57:13.180]   and it'd be profit center for Apple,
[00:57:13.180 --> 00:57:15.940]   if you could pay for it with your iTunes account.
[00:57:15.940 --> 00:57:17.740]   - And it's a pain in the butt to have to type in
[00:57:17.740 --> 00:57:20.660]   your account information.
[00:57:20.660 --> 00:57:22.140]   It really bummed me out the first time I used
[00:57:22.140 --> 00:57:25.020]   the Amtrak app to just buy my ticket
[00:57:25.020 --> 00:57:27.020]   from the airport back to my house,
[00:57:27.020 --> 00:57:29.460]   and I realized that, oh, you're not gonna just let me
[00:57:29.460 --> 00:57:31.100]   push a button and charge the iTunes account?
[00:57:31.100 --> 00:57:34.300]   Oh, okay, I'll do it, but oh, that would have been so slick.
[00:57:34.300 --> 00:57:36.100]   - Well, especially if I could just press my finger
[00:57:36.100 --> 00:57:39.300]   on the fingerprint reader, and it just goes right through.
[00:57:39.300 --> 00:57:40.740]   - Well, that's the, that's the remarkable thing,
[00:57:40.740 --> 00:57:42.300]   is Tim Cook actually said that yesterday
[00:57:42.300 --> 00:57:45.060]   during the conference call, which is probably unusual,
[00:57:45.060 --> 00:57:47.060]   but he said we built Touch ID for a reason,
[00:57:47.060 --> 00:57:49.220]   we're only using it for a few things now,
[00:57:49.220 --> 00:57:51.740]   but it's not, and he goes back to what they said
[00:57:51.740 --> 00:57:54.300]   about the demographics and how much people shop on iOS,
[00:57:54.300 --> 00:57:56.260]   but given the demographics we reported,
[00:57:56.260 --> 00:57:58.380]   you can easily see what kind of business that is,
[00:57:58.380 --> 00:58:00.260]   and that's probably the closest to a forward-looking
[00:58:00.260 --> 00:58:03.100]   statement we'll ever get from Tim Cook on a conference call.
[00:58:03.100 --> 00:58:07.540]   - Yeah, well, the numbers are strong.
[00:58:07.540 --> 00:58:12.540]   Apple has 575 million registered users,
[00:58:12.540 --> 00:58:15.220]   more than half a billion credit card numbers.
[00:58:16.660 --> 00:58:20.300]   So that's a lot of people, a forester analyst said,
[00:58:20.300 --> 00:58:22.700]   Apple is the sleeping giant in the payments world,
[00:58:22.700 --> 00:58:24.780]   they have the capability, they just haven't
[00:58:24.780 --> 00:58:26.500]   tied it all together.
[00:58:26.500 --> 00:58:29.380]   - Or, and the other question is, do they have the desire?
[00:58:29.380 --> 00:58:33.020]   Because this is such a huge and obvious opportunity,
[00:58:33.020 --> 00:58:35.060]   we have a world in which everybody is terrified,
[00:58:35.060 --> 00:58:36.820]   or excuse me, is really, really sick and tired
[00:58:36.820 --> 00:58:39.780]   of identity theft, and also a world in which everybody
[00:58:39.780 --> 00:58:42.780]   is sick of their banks, the banks are just making things
[00:58:42.780 --> 00:58:44.740]   more difficult, more cumbersome,
[00:58:44.740 --> 00:58:48.660]   they're not evolving as fast as devices are.
[00:58:48.660 --> 00:58:50.420]   If Apple decided to go one step more,
[00:58:50.420 --> 00:58:52.980]   and not simply use iTunes as a payment system,
[00:58:52.980 --> 00:58:57.980]   but to try to create a money services cloud sort of thing,
[00:58:57.980 --> 00:59:01.980]   okay, granted now you're into the one territory
[00:59:01.980 --> 00:59:04.300]   in which Apple kind of stinks, cloud services.
[00:59:04.300 --> 00:59:06.740]   But this is definitely an area
[00:59:06.740 --> 00:59:08.220]   in which some companies gonna come along
[00:59:08.220 --> 00:59:11.020]   and absolutely change everything.
[00:59:11.020 --> 00:59:12.700]   And Apple has all the pieces,
[00:59:12.700 --> 00:59:14.540]   the question is that Apple always wants to have
[00:59:14.540 --> 00:59:16.940]   a really nice lean product portfolio
[00:59:16.940 --> 00:59:19.300]   that they can pay either full attention to
[00:59:19.300 --> 00:59:21.260]   or something that's gonna pay off with them big
[00:59:21.260 --> 00:59:23.580]   in two or three or four years time.
[00:59:23.580 --> 00:59:25.620]   So they might not like the distraction.
[00:59:25.620 --> 00:59:27.700]   Also, there's the problem of what happens
[00:59:27.700 --> 00:59:31.660]   when you use an iTunes transaction to pay for something,
[00:59:31.660 --> 00:59:33.540]   and then the transmission on the car breaks,
[00:59:33.540 --> 00:59:35.540]   and now you can't get, now you have no leverage
[00:59:35.540 --> 00:59:37.500]   against this company, you feel as though Apple's partly
[00:59:37.500 --> 00:59:40.140]   to blame for it, 'cause Apple will not invalidate
[00:59:40.140 --> 00:59:41.780]   this transaction that was fraudulent,
[00:59:41.780 --> 00:59:43.460]   or a fraudulent transaction,
[00:59:43.460 --> 00:59:45.980]   or someone who scammed you for some reason.
[00:59:45.980 --> 00:59:48.820]   So maybe Apple simply says that I really don't want,
[00:59:48.820 --> 00:59:51.540]   we dodged the big bag of hurt known as Blu-ray,
[00:59:51.540 --> 00:59:53.700]   why would we pick up this bigger bag of hurt
[00:59:53.700 --> 00:59:56.740]   known as being the mom that these two squabbling brass
[00:59:56.740 --> 00:59:58.540]   come to when there's a disagreement?
[00:59:58.540 --> 01:00:00.620]   - They might want to intermediate it though,
[01:00:00.620 --> 01:00:01.860]   I mean, do what they do on the app store
[01:00:01.860 --> 01:00:03.780]   and just take a small percentage of the transaction
[01:00:03.780 --> 01:00:06.140]   in exchange for validating it on the device
[01:00:06.140 --> 01:00:08.260]   and processing it on the end.
[01:00:08.260 --> 01:00:10.300]   - Just as a way to say that,
[01:00:10.300 --> 01:00:15.140]   we have this user's credit card and credit card information,
[01:00:15.140 --> 01:00:17.180]   we are not gonna give it to you the person,
[01:00:17.180 --> 01:00:18.580]   we're not gonna give it to anybody,
[01:00:18.580 --> 01:00:21.300]   but we will verify that we have given this,
[01:00:21.300 --> 01:00:23.220]   we have given this credit card number
[01:00:23.220 --> 01:00:25.660]   to the transactor who has set back to us,
[01:00:25.660 --> 01:00:28.140]   and we're gonna communicate back to you the seller
[01:00:28.140 --> 01:00:32.020]   that this transaction is viable and will go through,
[01:00:32.020 --> 01:00:34.980]   'cause the one thing I want more than anything else is for me
[01:00:34.980 --> 01:00:36.460]   to be able to check into a hotel
[01:00:36.460 --> 01:00:39.660]   without this front desk ever seeing any of my credit cards,
[01:00:39.660 --> 01:00:40.900]   or to be able to pay for me,
[01:00:40.900 --> 01:00:44.700]   when I travel, even when I'm at home,
[01:00:44.700 --> 01:00:47.340]   I pay cash for all the meals that I take
[01:00:47.340 --> 01:00:49.540]   because I just don't like this idea
[01:00:49.540 --> 01:00:51.580]   that I'm going to give you this credit card
[01:00:51.580 --> 01:00:52.860]   and you're gonna walk away with it
[01:00:52.860 --> 01:00:55.100]   and then you're gonna come back and give it back to me,
[01:00:55.100 --> 01:00:57.620]   that just skews me out like nobody's business.
[01:00:57.620 --> 01:00:59.020]   But I would have to leave-- - You need chips
[01:00:59.020 --> 01:01:00.340]   and NFC like Canada, Andy.
[01:01:00.340 --> 01:01:01.860]   - Yeah.
[01:01:01.860 --> 01:01:03.500]   - Chip and Finn, my friend.
[01:01:03.500 --> 01:01:04.300]   - Yeah, Chip and Finn.
[01:01:04.300 --> 01:01:07.460]   - Yesterday, Apple released what is now becoming
[01:01:07.460 --> 01:01:10.660]   a regular report on national security
[01:01:10.660 --> 01:01:12.460]   and law enforcement orders.
[01:01:12.460 --> 01:01:18.300]   Apple joining a number of other companies like Google,
[01:01:18.300 --> 01:01:20.900]   I think who started it, Facebook, who are letting,
[01:01:20.900 --> 01:01:22.060]   these are transparency ports,
[01:01:22.060 --> 01:01:25.340]   letting you know what they're giving to the government.
[01:01:25.340 --> 01:01:27.020]   A couple of things I'd point out on this one,
[01:01:27.020 --> 01:01:29.380]   first of all, the raw numbers themselves,
[01:01:29.380 --> 01:01:31.940]   they say that they have received
[01:01:31.940 --> 01:01:35.940]   somewhere between zero and 249 national security orders.
[01:01:35.940 --> 01:01:37.420]   That's all they can say.
[01:01:37.420 --> 01:01:38.660]   'Cause the national security orders
[01:01:38.660 --> 01:01:42.620]   don't allow you to reveal any more information than that.
[01:01:42.620 --> 01:01:46.180]   They've received 927 law enforcement account requests
[01:01:46.180 --> 01:01:49.140]   from within the United States.
[01:01:49.140 --> 01:01:52.900]   Total of 2,330 accounts.
[01:01:52.900 --> 01:01:57.660]   The number of accounts for which data was disclosed, 747.
[01:01:57.660 --> 01:02:00.380]   Apple objected in 102 cases.
[01:02:00.380 --> 01:02:03.580]   No data was disclosed in 254 cases.
[01:02:03.580 --> 01:02:08.580]   81% of all requests were responded with two with some data.
[01:02:08.580 --> 01:02:12.020]   81%.
[01:02:12.020 --> 01:02:15.700]   But remember the warrant Canary clause that Apple
[01:02:15.700 --> 01:02:18.420]   included a couple of years, a couple of months ago
[01:02:18.420 --> 01:02:23.340]   in their transparency report.
[01:02:23.340 --> 01:02:25.500]   The quote was, "Apple has never received an order
[01:02:25.500 --> 01:02:28.260]   "under section 215 of the USA Patriot Act."
[01:02:28.260 --> 01:02:30.500]   And the thought thinking was,
[01:02:30.500 --> 01:02:32.860]   well, they call it Canary because if that language
[01:02:32.860 --> 01:02:34.940]   were no longer to appear in the transparency report,
[01:02:34.940 --> 01:02:37.740]   then you know that they had received
[01:02:37.740 --> 01:02:40.420]   a national security letter, clever way of revealing
[01:02:40.420 --> 01:02:42.100]   what they're not supposed to reveal.
[01:02:42.100 --> 01:02:44.700]   That language is no longer in this report.
[01:02:44.700 --> 01:02:49.420]   So I don't know whether you had that.
[01:02:49.420 --> 01:02:51.460]   Is the Canary triggered?
[01:02:51.460 --> 01:02:55.700]   Or maybe the Fed said, you know, you can't do that.
[01:02:55.700 --> 01:02:57.700]   Get that out of there.
[01:02:57.700 --> 01:02:58.780]   Either way, something changed.
[01:02:58.780 --> 01:02:59.860]   Something changed.
[01:03:01.220 --> 01:03:02.660]   I wish I wish I could.
[01:03:02.660 --> 01:03:04.980]   The numbers are encouraging when you compare it,
[01:03:04.980 --> 01:03:07.100]   especially on a week where we found out exactly
[01:03:07.100 --> 01:03:11.100]   how many devices are being sold, much less used.
[01:03:11.100 --> 01:03:13.220]   But I believe this is more of an indication
[01:03:13.220 --> 01:03:18.220]   of how little the government needs to actually go to the top.
[01:03:18.220 --> 01:03:23.220]   Go to Google, go to Apple because our lives are so leaky
[01:03:23.220 --> 01:03:25.940]   that it's like, I can either go through all the rigmarole
[01:03:25.940 --> 01:03:27.460]   of getting a warrant to search your house
[01:03:27.460 --> 01:03:29.300]   or I can wait for the second,
[01:03:29.300 --> 01:03:31.300]   for the every alternate Tuesday in which you will take
[01:03:31.300 --> 01:03:33.500]   all of your papers and put them on the curb.
[01:03:33.500 --> 01:03:35.380]   And we can just simply get there about 10 minutes ahead
[01:03:35.380 --> 01:03:37.100]   of the recycling truck and we will have everything we want.
[01:03:37.100 --> 01:03:39.780]   I wish it were as simple as saying,
[01:03:39.780 --> 01:03:42.700]   well, the government is not that interested
[01:03:42.700 --> 01:03:43.940]   in people's transactions.
[01:03:43.940 --> 01:03:44.780]   Yeah.
[01:03:44.780 --> 01:03:46.500]   It's amazing.
[01:03:46.500 --> 01:03:48.340]   It's amazing what you can get about somebody
[01:03:48.340 --> 01:03:49.580]   just by doing a Google search.
[01:03:49.580 --> 01:03:51.540]   I mean, you know, I think that when you think about the
[01:03:51.540 --> 01:03:53.900]   government having just a little more than that,
[01:03:53.900 --> 01:03:57.180]   it's amazing how much of a cloud of information
[01:03:57.180 --> 01:03:59.540]   can be generated without a lot of extra work.
[01:03:59.540 --> 01:04:01.940]   They did say the thing that Andy wanted them to say,
[01:04:01.940 --> 01:04:04.060]   and maybe they should say this in a more public fashion
[01:04:04.060 --> 01:04:06.700]   than this PDF on the Apple website.
[01:04:06.700 --> 01:04:09.020]   We work hard to deliver the most secure hardware
[01:04:09.020 --> 01:04:10.220]   and software in the world,
[01:04:10.220 --> 01:04:11.940]   and we will continue to provide our customers
[01:04:11.940 --> 01:04:14.940]   with the best privacy protections available.
[01:04:14.940 --> 01:04:17.260]   Personal conversations are protected using end-to-end
[01:04:17.260 --> 01:04:19.220]   encryption over iMessage at FaceTime,
[01:04:19.220 --> 01:04:21.580]   and Apple does not store location data map searches
[01:04:21.580 --> 01:04:24.740]   or Siri requests in any identifiable form.
[01:04:26.020 --> 01:04:28.820]   So that's the kind of language you want to hear, right?
[01:04:28.820 --> 01:04:31.220]   Again, I want to see it in a commercial
[01:04:31.220 --> 01:04:32.980]   because it sells so many more I've had.
[01:04:32.980 --> 01:04:35.500]   It sells so many so many more phones.
[01:04:35.500 --> 01:04:37.740]   Big update, I work.
[01:04:37.740 --> 01:04:40.820]   We got Apple scripts back in numbers,
[01:04:40.820 --> 01:04:43.460]   the spreadsheet program and I work,
[01:04:43.460 --> 01:04:47.340]   password protected sharing, web and mobile,
[01:04:47.340 --> 01:04:48.900]   Apple's keeping true to its promise,
[01:04:48.900 --> 01:04:50.220]   and this is what they said.
[01:04:50.220 --> 01:04:52.380]   We got to rewrite all this stuff to bring it up
[01:04:52.380 --> 01:04:55.540]   into the 21st century in 64-bit,
[01:04:55.540 --> 01:04:59.540]   but as a result, as we did with iMovie
[01:04:59.540 --> 01:05:00.940]   and Final Cut, we took stuff out,
[01:05:00.940 --> 01:05:02.740]   but we're going to slowly add it.
[01:05:02.740 --> 01:05:06.460]   And updates went out about a less than a week ago
[01:05:06.460 --> 01:05:10.460]   to I work across all platforms, iOS 10 and iCloud.
[01:05:10.460 --> 01:05:14.460]   Lot of new things, a vertical ruler,
[01:05:14.460 --> 01:05:16.420]   in pages, you know, customizable web.
[01:05:16.420 --> 01:05:17.980]   - It's a gorgeous web app.
[01:05:17.980 --> 01:05:20.220]   - I mean, even outside of the realm of Apple news,
[01:05:20.220 --> 01:05:21.620]   that's a gorgeous web app
[01:05:21.620 --> 01:05:23.220]   that should impress anybody
[01:05:23.220 --> 01:05:26.820]   on what's capable of what a modern browser is capable of.
[01:05:26.820 --> 01:05:28.300]   - Yeah, I agree.
[01:05:28.300 --> 01:05:30.620]   Is it, do you have to go to iWork.com to use it?
[01:05:30.620 --> 01:05:32.620]   Or it's part of your iCloud.
[01:05:32.620 --> 01:05:35.420]   I had it as beta, is it generally available now?
[01:05:35.420 --> 01:05:37.060]   How is that work?
[01:05:37.060 --> 01:05:39.860]   - I haven't checked, I haven't fired up my Chromebook
[01:05:39.860 --> 01:05:40.900]   to test it out.
[01:05:40.900 --> 01:05:43.660]   On the old one, the previous iteration,
[01:05:43.660 --> 01:05:45.580]   you could just use all these great iWork tools
[01:05:45.580 --> 01:05:47.180]   on a $249.
[01:05:47.180 --> 01:05:48.500]   - It works great in the Chromebook.
[01:05:48.500 --> 01:05:51.260]   - Yeah, I mean, so good that I think that some people
[01:05:51.260 --> 01:05:53.620]   who are, some Mac users who are budget minded
[01:05:53.620 --> 01:05:56.020]   might even seriously consider,
[01:05:56.020 --> 01:06:00.300]   if I don't, if I really want an 11 inch MacBook Air,
[01:06:00.300 --> 01:06:03.020]   but I don't really have a $1,000 to spend on that,
[01:06:03.020 --> 01:06:07.340]   hey, if you can get a look at iCloud on a Chromebook,
[01:06:07.340 --> 01:06:10.380]   you might find that if you're using iWork
[01:06:10.380 --> 01:06:13.820]   as your main document store, your main document truth,
[01:06:13.820 --> 01:06:16.820]   and you have an easily predictable list
[01:06:16.820 --> 01:06:18.780]   of requirements for a notebook,
[01:06:18.780 --> 01:06:21.940]   you can save $250 and you will feel very, very little pain
[01:06:21.940 --> 01:06:23.340]   in the outcome of it.
[01:06:23.340 --> 01:06:24.660]   But I have not tried the new one.
[01:06:24.660 --> 01:06:26.740]   I'd be surprised if it didn't work
[01:06:26.740 --> 01:06:29.060]   because the old version just worked like a charm.
[01:06:29.060 --> 01:06:32.460]   - Still says beta in the upper right hand corner.
[01:06:32.460 --> 01:06:33.620]   - It's open.
[01:06:33.620 --> 01:06:35.420]   - But it is open, it's an open beta.
[01:06:35.420 --> 01:06:37.100]   - Yeah, it's not developers only, yeah.
[01:06:37.100 --> 01:06:39.340]   Non-developers have gotten in.
[01:06:39.340 --> 01:06:41.300]   - I think they're just really,
[01:06:41.300 --> 01:06:44.220]   what's great is that they're updating this
[01:06:44.220 --> 01:06:45.380]   across all platforms.
[01:06:45.380 --> 01:06:48.100]   So a new feature in on the web, for instance,
[01:06:48.100 --> 01:06:51.380]   is immediately reflected everywhere else,
[01:06:51.380 --> 01:06:52.220]   and vice versa.
[01:06:52.220 --> 01:06:53.060]   And I think that's--
[01:06:53.060 --> 01:06:54.700]   - That was the benefit of the pain that we went through.
[01:06:54.700 --> 01:06:55.540]   - Yeah, that's a tough thing.
[01:06:55.540 --> 01:06:57.620]   - They took the iOS core and they moved it over to OS X
[01:06:57.620 --> 01:06:59.740]   and it hurt really badly, but now we're gonna benefit.
[01:06:59.740 --> 01:07:02.060]   - Yeah, yeah, I think this is great.
[01:07:02.060 --> 01:07:03.380]   I'm very pleased.
[01:07:03.380 --> 01:07:06.540]   And you're right, I mean, this is a web app.
[01:07:06.540 --> 01:07:08.300]   In fact, I'm running in Chrome.
[01:07:08.300 --> 01:07:11.660]   It looks as good as the, almost as good as a desktop app.
[01:07:11.660 --> 01:07:13.260]   I guess it does look as good as a desktop app.
[01:07:13.260 --> 01:07:15.060]   - And I have to say, it's phenomenal.
[01:07:15.060 --> 01:07:17.700]   - The new version of iWork really threw me
[01:07:17.700 --> 01:07:19.420]   when they went into a single window interface.
[01:07:19.420 --> 01:07:21.780]   And I had a lot of fear that they had really dumbed it down
[01:07:21.780 --> 01:07:23.940]   in order to make it universal like that.
[01:07:23.940 --> 01:07:27.460]   But now I've built three, four different really complicated
[01:07:27.460 --> 01:07:28.660]   presentations in keynote.
[01:07:28.660 --> 01:07:31.860]   And I can't really identify anything that I've lost,
[01:07:31.860 --> 01:07:34.100]   anything they've taken away.
[01:07:34.100 --> 01:07:36.540]   There are websites that will point out to me exactly
[01:07:36.540 --> 01:07:38.580]   what they've taken away, or at least in the early versions
[01:07:38.580 --> 01:07:42.580]   of it, but that's, it really, you love it when you just get
[01:07:42.580 --> 01:07:47.300]   your draw in a drop attitude to realize that they simplified
[01:07:47.300 --> 01:07:49.660]   it and they didn't make it dumber.
[01:07:49.660 --> 01:07:50.860]   That's neat.
[01:07:50.860 --> 01:07:52.260]   That's what that app does very well.
[01:07:52.260 --> 01:07:53.100]   - I think Horace did.
[01:07:53.100 --> 01:07:55.300]   - I think it, it also, on your mind, always think opinions
[01:07:55.300 --> 01:07:56.300]   that this is all you can do.
[01:07:56.300 --> 01:07:58.140]   I mean, all of us that use Google Docs just feel like,
[01:07:58.140 --> 01:07:59.940]   well, that's the best you can be able to do on a browser.
[01:07:59.940 --> 01:08:00.780]   - So much nice.
[01:08:00.780 --> 01:08:02.300]   - That's why it's so limited is because of the browser.
[01:08:02.300 --> 01:08:04.260]   And it turns out it's just limited because it's limited.
[01:08:04.260 --> 01:08:05.100]   - Right.
[01:08:05.100 --> 01:08:05.940]   - Yeah.
[01:08:05.940 --> 01:08:07.500]   - Yeah, I'm playing with it right now.
[01:08:07.500 --> 01:08:11.500]   - Also, also because, think about how much hell
[01:08:11.500 --> 01:08:15.140]   that Google got when they moved a single like button
[01:08:15.140 --> 01:08:18.740]   in Gmail, when you have so many people who are devoted
[01:08:18.740 --> 01:08:21.620]   to this and who are not really fans of it
[01:08:21.620 --> 01:08:24.380]   and not really believers in it, but people who use it day
[01:08:24.380 --> 01:08:27.060]   in and day out, who simply believe that this is a hammer
[01:08:27.060 --> 01:08:29.060]   that they pick up and they whack things with it.
[01:08:29.060 --> 01:08:32.220]   Once they decide to change the shape of the handle,
[01:08:32.220 --> 01:08:33.740]   it's not supposed to be that shape,
[01:08:33.740 --> 01:08:34.580]   it's supposed to be the shape of the first one.
[01:08:34.580 --> 01:08:36.500]   - Well, no, and I'm the first one to do that with Google.
[01:08:36.500 --> 01:08:38.380]   It's like, you know, we do hangouts every day.
[01:08:38.380 --> 01:08:39.860]   You know, we do 300 hangouts a year.
[01:08:39.860 --> 01:08:42.220]   And Google is constantly changing the interface
[01:08:42.220 --> 01:08:43.060]   for the hangout.
[01:08:43.060 --> 01:08:44.380]   And we're always like, we'll wake up one day
[01:08:44.380 --> 01:08:45.540]   and the buttons are in different place.
[01:08:45.540 --> 01:08:46.620]   And then there's a whole bunch of emails like,
[01:08:46.620 --> 01:08:47.460]   why did you do that?
[01:08:47.460 --> 01:08:48.300]   Blah, blah, blah, blah.
[01:08:48.300 --> 01:08:52.860]   So I definitely understand where the worst of those,
[01:08:52.860 --> 01:08:53.700]   that bunch.
[01:08:53.700 --> 01:08:56.580]   - Also, Google is really good in that they think of the,
[01:08:56.580 --> 01:08:59.260]   how they completely rewrote maps.
[01:08:59.260 --> 01:09:00.780]   And they have a really good policy
[01:09:00.780 --> 01:09:01.940]   of how they roll these things out.
[01:09:01.940 --> 01:09:04.860]   They simply, when it's ready for beta,
[01:09:04.860 --> 01:09:07.140]   they will simply give you a little pop up that says,
[01:09:07.140 --> 01:09:09.100]   we have a beta new idea.
[01:09:09.100 --> 01:09:10.940]   If you want to use it, if you don't want to use it,
[01:09:10.940 --> 01:09:11.980]   we will do nothing.
[01:09:11.980 --> 01:09:14.180]   And that's almost exactly what the box says.
[01:09:14.180 --> 01:09:16.980]   If you don't want to do this, nothing will change.
[01:09:16.980 --> 01:09:18.700]   It will be okay.
[01:09:18.700 --> 01:09:20.620]   And so they get the people who are enthusiastic
[01:09:20.620 --> 01:09:22.060]   for the new experience while holding on
[01:09:22.060 --> 01:09:23.020]   to the people of the old experience.
[01:09:23.020 --> 01:09:26.260]   So there is a point to be made that if Google Docs
[01:09:26.260 --> 01:09:27.500]   works the way it does right now,
[01:09:27.500 --> 01:09:30.460]   it's because that's the way that Google wants it to work.
[01:09:30.460 --> 01:09:32.340]   - So Apple scripts back in numbers,
[01:09:32.340 --> 01:09:36.900]   not yet in pages and keynote, but perhaps soon.
[01:09:36.900 --> 01:09:39.820]   I'm just, it's gratifying that they have an orphaned them
[01:09:39.820 --> 01:09:41.140]   that they're continuing to update.
[01:09:41.140 --> 01:09:41.980]   - Sure, I mean, that's really good.
[01:09:41.980 --> 01:09:43.060]   - Yeah.
[01:09:43.060 --> 01:09:43.900]   - Yeah.
[01:09:43.900 --> 01:09:53.620]   I guess we can, well, we should probably mention the Mac 30th.
[01:09:53.620 --> 01:09:55.460]   I feel like I've already talked a lot about it.
[01:09:55.460 --> 01:09:58.700]   We did a whole big thing on a twit this week.
[01:09:58.700 --> 01:10:03.700]   January 22nd, 1984, the Super Bowl ad.
[01:10:03.700 --> 01:10:07.540]   Why 1984 won't be like 1984.
[01:10:07.540 --> 01:10:08.580]   (crowd groans)
[01:10:08.580 --> 01:10:09.540]   Yeah, thank you.
[01:10:09.540 --> 01:10:11.020]   (laughs)
[01:10:11.020 --> 01:10:12.700]   January 20th. - Sorry, I came in late.
[01:10:12.700 --> 01:10:15.020]   - I like it though, that's good.
[01:10:15.020 --> 01:10:16.900]   Is that, what was the copy?
[01:10:16.900 --> 01:10:20.700]   - In January, Apple will release,
[01:10:20.700 --> 01:10:22.420]   I don't know, release Macintosh.
[01:10:22.420 --> 01:10:24.020]   - Macintosh.
[01:10:24.020 --> 01:10:29.020]   And you'll learn why 1984 won't be like 1984.
[01:10:29.020 --> 01:10:31.780]   (crowd groans)
[01:10:31.780 --> 01:10:37.900]   - I just remember the young woman running down
[01:10:37.900 --> 01:10:39.500]   with the chance lead jammer.
[01:10:40.500 --> 01:10:44.380]   I think that is the test if you were a real Mac fan or not.
[01:10:44.380 --> 01:10:47.860]   If you were to isolate just the grunt that that woman exerts
[01:10:47.860 --> 01:10:49.340]   when she's throwing the hammer,
[01:10:49.340 --> 01:10:52.140]   if you can identify that instantly,
[01:10:52.140 --> 01:10:53.540]   then you are a real Mac person.
[01:10:53.540 --> 01:10:55.180]   (laughs)
[01:10:55.180 --> 01:10:57.380]   Not then, I'm sorry, you can't be,
[01:10:57.380 --> 01:10:58.340]   you can come to the party,
[01:10:58.340 --> 01:11:00.700]   you just can't come to the velvet row part of the room.
[01:11:00.700 --> 01:11:02.100]   - Here we go, I might as well play it.
[01:11:02.100 --> 01:11:04.020]   We've talked enough about it, here we go.
[01:11:04.020 --> 01:11:06.860]   (crowd mumbles)
[01:11:06.860 --> 01:11:09.660]   - Supposedly IBM.
[01:11:09.660 --> 01:11:11.380]   - I always wanted to be played for you,
[01:11:11.380 --> 01:11:12.940]   with the well-balanced.
[01:11:12.940 --> 01:11:15.580]   - The garden of pure ideology,
[01:11:15.580 --> 01:11:17.860]   where each one might live,
[01:11:17.860 --> 01:11:19.300]   secure from the pisses.
[01:11:19.300 --> 01:11:20.580]   - I have to say that I have pits
[01:11:20.580 --> 01:11:22.220]   that are very much like those drones.
[01:11:22.220 --> 01:11:24.060]   (laughs)
[01:11:24.060 --> 01:11:25.860]   - I think that's daft and punk, they're loose.
[01:11:25.860 --> 01:11:28.900]   They're comfortable, it's soft cloth.
[01:11:28.900 --> 01:11:30.260]   I could wear that top.
[01:11:30.260 --> 01:11:33.180]   Here comes the grunt, get ready.
[01:11:33.180 --> 01:11:36.100]   (crowd mumbles)
[01:11:36.100 --> 01:11:38.860]   (crowd mumbles)
[01:11:38.860 --> 01:11:51.100]   - On January 24th.
[01:11:51.100 --> 01:11:53.180]   - I think while those guys got in their mouths,
[01:11:53.180 --> 01:11:54.260]   oh my God.
[01:11:54.260 --> 01:11:55.740]   - And you'll see why 19--
[01:11:55.740 --> 01:11:57.700]   - If you were one of the drones,
[01:11:57.700 --> 01:12:00.780]   like 1980s, I want you to call us right now.
[01:12:00.780 --> 01:12:02.340]   - Tell us, you know, it was like--
[01:12:02.340 --> 01:12:03.900]   - Something just occurred to me
[01:12:03.900 --> 01:12:05.340]   that's never occurred to me no matter
[01:12:05.340 --> 01:12:06.820]   how many times I've watched that.
[01:12:06.820 --> 01:12:09.780]   I am so surprised that all the conflict conventions
[01:12:09.780 --> 01:12:13.940]   I've gone to, I've not seen one woman in that outfit.
[01:12:13.940 --> 01:12:16.380]   That would be the most awesome costume ever.
[01:12:16.380 --> 01:12:17.580]   (laughs)
[01:12:17.580 --> 01:12:19.860]   Because everybody, everybody who would see that,
[01:12:19.860 --> 01:12:22.620]   they would say, oh my God, I have to get my picture with you.
[01:12:22.620 --> 01:12:23.460]   - Yeah, no kidding.
[01:12:23.460 --> 01:12:24.580]   - That is the most awesome thing ever.
[01:12:24.580 --> 01:12:26.740]   - No kidding, wouldn't that be amazing?
[01:12:26.740 --> 01:12:28.260]   - I almost like right now,
[01:12:28.260 --> 01:12:29.740]   I almost want to go to Dunkin' Donuts,
[01:12:29.740 --> 01:12:32.900]   buy like $100 Dunkin' Donuts or Starbucks gift card,
[01:12:32.900 --> 01:12:34.140]   have that waiting in my wallet
[01:12:34.140 --> 01:12:37.300]   so that the first time I see someone female, ideally,
[01:12:37.300 --> 01:12:39.540]   I'll be open-minded, but really I'm looking for a woman
[01:12:39.540 --> 01:12:41.100]   and not a hairy guy.
[01:12:41.100 --> 01:12:42.780]   But again, I'm open-minded.
[01:12:42.780 --> 01:12:44.420]   - I might do it, I think that'd be fun.
[01:12:44.420 --> 01:12:45.820]   - I want, so if I ever see that,
[01:12:45.820 --> 01:12:47.620]   I want to be able to reach in my pocket, say,
[01:12:47.620 --> 01:12:50.780]   please accept these $100 in pastries and high end coffees
[01:12:50.780 --> 01:12:52.940]   with my compliments.
[01:12:52.940 --> 01:12:54.460]   - There's, yeah, very much orders.
[01:12:54.460 --> 01:12:55.300]   - Yes.
[01:12:55.300 --> 01:12:58.340]   - So that was January 22nd, that was the Super Bowl.
[01:12:58.340 --> 01:13:02.180]   24th, Steve Jobs did that famous announcement
[01:13:02.180 --> 01:13:04.500]   at this Flint Center in Cupertino.
[01:13:04.500 --> 01:13:06.540]   It was actually a shareholders meeting.
[01:13:06.540 --> 01:13:09.900]   This was a prototype for future Jobs' keynotes.
[01:13:09.900 --> 01:13:13.220]   It wasn't exactly how it would be in the future.
[01:13:13.220 --> 01:13:15.380]   It wasn't open to the public for one thing.
[01:13:15.380 --> 01:13:17.020]   Pulls the Macintosh out of the bag
[01:13:17.020 --> 01:13:19.460]   and the Macintosh talks as a charity fires thing.
[01:13:19.460 --> 01:13:22.100]   And then Harry McCracken wrote about this
[01:13:22.100 --> 01:13:25.580]   in the technologizer@techlantatime.com.
[01:13:25.580 --> 01:13:28.900]   Apparently, then January 30th,
[01:13:28.900 --> 01:13:31.780]   Jobs went to Boston, to the Boston Computer Society.
[01:13:31.780 --> 01:13:33.700]   You weren't a member of the Boston Computer Society
[01:13:33.700 --> 01:13:34.540]   at the time.
[01:13:34.540 --> 01:13:37.580]   - That was about three years before my time in the hospital.
[01:13:37.580 --> 01:13:40.180]   - Harry was, he says, I've unaccountably decided
[01:13:40.180 --> 01:13:41.580]   not to go to that meeting.
[01:13:41.580 --> 01:13:42.940]   He regretted it forever.
[01:13:42.940 --> 01:13:43.980]   Well, if you didn't go to the meeting,
[01:13:43.980 --> 01:13:44.900]   here's some good news.
[01:13:44.900 --> 01:13:48.180]   Apparently, all the Boston Computer Society meetings
[01:13:48.180 --> 01:13:52.580]   were recorded on videotape with professional recording,
[01:13:52.580 --> 01:13:56.300]   good audio, better in fact, than the shareholder meeting.
[01:13:56.300 --> 01:14:00.620]   They all were stored on eumatic tapes and recently digitized.
[01:14:00.620 --> 01:14:02.540]   So if you go to this Time Magazine page,
[01:14:02.540 --> 01:14:04.740]   you'll see this video for the first time
[01:14:04.740 --> 01:14:05.900]   available to the public.
[01:14:05.900 --> 01:14:06.860]   - The jobs from Apple Computer,
[01:14:06.860 --> 01:14:08.780]   we're very glad to be here tonight.
[01:14:08.780 --> 01:14:12.260]   - And this is the pretty much the same announcement.
[01:14:12.260 --> 01:14:15.780]   - It is 1958.
[01:14:15.780 --> 01:14:17.100]   - He goes to the history of computer science.
[01:14:17.100 --> 01:14:20.420]   - IBM passes up the chance to buy a young fledgling company
[01:14:20.420 --> 01:14:24.420]   that has just invented a new technology called Xerography.
[01:14:24.420 --> 01:14:25.780]   - The difference is, by the way,
[01:14:25.780 --> 01:14:28.180]   that Jobs is now talking to enthusiasts
[01:14:28.180 --> 01:14:29.380]   to potential customers.
[01:14:29.380 --> 01:14:32.100]   No longer is he talking to shareholders.
[01:14:32.100 --> 01:14:33.500]   He pulls the Mac out of the bag,
[01:14:33.500 --> 01:14:35.500]   the Mac talks the chariots to fire a theme.
[01:14:35.500 --> 01:14:36.340]   Let's see if I can--
[01:14:36.340 --> 01:14:39.020]   - He has over twice the dots of the IBM PC.
[01:14:39.020 --> 01:14:39.860]   - Twice the dot.
[01:14:39.860 --> 01:14:40.780]   Oh, let's go back a little bit.
[01:14:40.780 --> 01:14:41.980]   - This screen has over--
[01:14:41.980 --> 01:14:45.420]   - Oh, I want to show you getting it
[01:14:45.420 --> 01:14:46.940]   in the end of the bag.
[01:14:46.940 --> 01:14:47.780]   - This screen has over twice the dots.
[01:14:47.780 --> 01:14:49.180]   - So hard to scrub on YouTube.
[01:14:49.180 --> 01:14:52.020]   - Of the IBM PC or Apple II on its screen.
[01:14:52.020 --> 01:14:53.300]   Very high definition. - Which is what?
[01:14:53.300 --> 01:14:55.100]   - And all of this power fits into a box
[01:14:55.100 --> 01:14:58.260]   one third the size and weight of the IBM PC.
[01:14:58.260 --> 01:14:59.820]   It's a truly transportable product.
[01:14:59.820 --> 01:15:01.660]   - PC came out in '81, so that was the--
[01:15:01.660 --> 01:15:02.500]   - There's an addition to that.
[01:15:02.500 --> 01:15:03.900]   There's an old family of stuff that goes along with it.
[01:15:03.900 --> 01:15:05.220]   Image writer, printers, external--
[01:15:05.220 --> 01:15:07.060]   - Look at that modem. - I'm carrying--
[01:15:07.060 --> 01:15:07.900]   - Look at that image writer.
[01:15:07.900 --> 01:15:09.740]   - Sort of security kit so your Macintosh
[01:15:09.740 --> 01:15:11.380]   doesn't go anywhere without you.
[01:15:11.380 --> 01:15:15.340]   Now, you've seen some pictures of Macintosh
[01:15:15.340 --> 01:15:18.060]   in these slides, but what I'd like to do now
[01:15:18.060 --> 01:15:20.340]   is show you the Macintosh in person.
[01:15:20.340 --> 01:15:24.900]   And all of the images that you will be seeing
[01:15:24.900 --> 01:15:28.260]   will be generated by what's in that bag right there.
[01:15:28.260 --> 01:15:32.860]   - So Harry says in some ways the Sharehold meeting
[01:15:32.860 --> 01:15:34.820]   was a rehearsal for this.
[01:15:34.820 --> 01:15:38.500]   This is the more polished version of the Macintosh reveal.
[01:15:38.500 --> 01:15:41.560]   January 30th, 1984, 30 years ago.
[01:15:41.560 --> 01:15:46.420]   Plugs it in.
[01:15:46.420 --> 01:15:50.180]   - I'm having flashbacks to every BCS meeting
[01:15:50.180 --> 01:15:51.980]   in which I could not get the projector to work.
[01:15:51.980 --> 01:15:54.060]   (laughing)
[01:15:54.060 --> 01:15:55.740]   - He sticks the floppy in the drive,
[01:15:55.740 --> 01:15:57.740]   the single 400K floppy drive.
[01:15:57.740 --> 01:16:00.220]   Now they've seen probably--
[01:16:00.220 --> 01:16:02.740]   Well, maybe they haven't, you know, this is pre-YouTube.
[01:16:02.740 --> 01:16:04.420]   They may have never seen this before,
[01:16:04.420 --> 01:16:06.020]   probably haven't actually.
[01:16:06.020 --> 01:16:08.600]   (upbeat music)
[01:16:08.600 --> 01:16:20.300]   So people who think they've seen this before,
[01:16:20.300 --> 01:16:22.300]   you've seen the Shareholders meeting videos.
[01:16:22.300 --> 01:16:25.060]   This is a pretty much higher quality video.
[01:16:25.060 --> 01:16:28.140]   The geeks are excited about this.
[01:16:28.140 --> 01:16:31.740]   This is a very smooth scrolling bitmap font
[01:16:31.740 --> 01:16:32.940]   on the Macintosh screen.
[01:16:32.940 --> 01:16:37.460]   That's something, you know, the Xerox Alto did,
[01:16:37.460 --> 01:16:41.860]   the Star did, Lisa might have done for a lot more money.
[01:16:41.860 --> 01:16:44.900]   - A lot of this was just the excitement of seeing things
[01:16:44.900 --> 01:16:46.980]   in a that were built in features
[01:16:46.980 --> 01:16:49.780]   for a personal computer that would have been $800
[01:16:49.780 --> 01:16:50.780]   for the specialty hardware.
[01:16:50.780 --> 01:16:51.700]   - Right.
[01:16:51.700 --> 01:16:52.540]   - Right.
[01:16:52.540 --> 01:16:54.540]   - Even just when it said, "Phew, it was good
[01:16:54.540 --> 01:16:56.580]   to get out of that bag."
[01:16:56.580 --> 01:16:58.420]   - That was amazing.
[01:16:58.420 --> 01:17:00.740]   But not unheard of is what you're saying.
[01:17:00.740 --> 01:17:02.580]   Just amazing for general purposes.
[01:17:02.580 --> 01:17:04.660]   - It's like, no, that's not a sound card that is.
[01:17:04.660 --> 01:17:07.660]   We just decided to have a speech that this is gonna be.
[01:17:07.660 --> 01:17:10.900]   - There's a really great, so what is different in this is
[01:17:10.900 --> 01:17:13.740]   he's got the Mac team with him.
[01:17:13.740 --> 01:17:15.940]   You'll see, for instance, this is,
[01:17:15.940 --> 01:17:20.820]   is it Andy Hertzfeld demonstrating Mac paint.
[01:17:21.660 --> 01:17:22.500]   - You'll see it.
[01:17:22.500 --> 01:17:24.620]   - It finishes it off for me.
[01:17:24.620 --> 01:17:25.460]   - Who's that?
[01:17:25.460 --> 01:17:26.300]   Is that Steve Cabs?
[01:17:26.300 --> 01:17:28.540]   - A little more free form tool.
[01:17:28.540 --> 01:17:30.220]   - Much of the team is there.
[01:17:30.220 --> 01:17:31.860]   They're showing off the software.
[01:17:31.860 --> 01:17:35.380]   Was kind of, that's not was, I know,
[01:17:35.380 --> 01:17:36.900]   but was, I think there's horn,
[01:17:36.900 --> 01:17:41.340]   but was shows up in the middle unannounced
[01:17:41.340 --> 01:17:43.140]   to start plugging the Apple II.
[01:17:43.140 --> 01:17:45.660]   It's really fun.
[01:17:45.660 --> 01:17:46.820]   And then at the end.
[01:17:46.820 --> 01:17:50.700]   - Yes, the one I missed before.
[01:17:50.700 --> 01:17:53.740]   - This is the question Steve did not want.
[01:17:53.740 --> 01:17:55.100]   - See, you missed it again.
[01:17:55.100 --> 01:17:57.980]   - I grabbed a brief bit of it,
[01:17:57.980 --> 01:17:59.020]   which is sort of,
[01:17:59.020 --> 01:18:00.580]   followed by the wayside it seems.
[01:18:00.580 --> 01:18:02.300]   So there's gonna be a TV emulation mode
[01:18:02.300 --> 01:18:03.340]   and three,
[01:18:03.340 --> 01:18:04.180]   and the sites are gonna be--
[01:18:04.180 --> 01:18:05.620]   - What's gonna happen to the Apple III?
[01:18:05.620 --> 01:18:09.340]   - These are gonna be continued to work with the Apple III.
[01:18:09.340 --> 01:18:10.660]   So what do we call them?
[01:18:10.660 --> 01:18:11.980]   I don't know what you're question.
[01:18:11.980 --> 01:18:14.300]   (laughing)
[01:18:14.300 --> 01:18:15.660]   - Steve says, I wouldn't have called on you
[01:18:15.660 --> 01:18:18.420]   if I'd known that, it's your question.
[01:18:18.420 --> 01:18:19.260]   And then lies.
[01:18:19.260 --> 01:18:22.980]   - We're shipping about 2,500 Apple IIIs a month.
[01:18:22.980 --> 01:18:25.820]   And 80% of those are going to people--
[01:18:25.820 --> 01:18:27.500]   - With 100% failure rate.
[01:18:27.500 --> 01:18:28.740]   - Which means two things.
[01:18:28.740 --> 01:18:31.180]   One, the three is a pretty niche product.
[01:18:31.180 --> 01:18:33.380]   And two, people are really happy with them.
[01:18:33.380 --> 01:18:35.900]   So we anticipate making threes until the cows come home.
[01:18:35.900 --> 01:18:36.740]   - Definitely not.
[01:18:36.740 --> 01:18:37.940]   - They probably, they'd already--
[01:18:37.940 --> 01:18:40.100]   - The cows came home and returned their defective Apple III.
[01:18:40.100 --> 01:18:42.300]   - The cows did not want the Apple III,
[01:18:42.300 --> 01:18:44.740]   and I think died shortly after.
[01:18:44.740 --> 01:18:46.820]   They also, there is a,
[01:18:46.820 --> 01:18:47.740]   which is really fun.
[01:18:47.740 --> 01:18:49.900]   This is afterwards, they showed the question
[01:18:49.900 --> 01:18:51.060]   and the answer session.
[01:18:51.060 --> 01:18:52.260]   Here's Waz talking.
[01:18:52.260 --> 01:18:54.860]   - With what went before, we don't take a major extreme step
[01:18:54.860 --> 01:18:56.900]   that's much better, but not compatible
[01:18:56.900 --> 01:18:57.740]   with what happened before.
[01:18:57.740 --> 01:18:58.580]   - I'm a computer of people.
[01:18:58.580 --> 01:18:59.420]   - It can be done.
[01:18:59.420 --> 01:19:00.780]   I think a more logical way to get there is--
[01:19:00.780 --> 01:19:01.620]   - So neat.
[01:19:01.620 --> 01:19:04.180]   - Apple IIs always have slots, maybe a specific Apple II
[01:19:04.180 --> 01:19:08.260]   that is designed with a special slot for 80, 86 cards and 80--
[01:19:08.260 --> 01:19:09.500]   - So this is a great video.
[01:19:09.500 --> 01:19:10.860]   It's about an hour long.
[01:19:10.860 --> 01:19:13.260]   If you haven't had a chance to see it,
[01:19:13.260 --> 01:19:16.900]   it's on the Time Magazine Technologizer blog.
[01:19:16.900 --> 01:19:18.780]   - This is-- - It's also cool just to see
[01:19:18.780 --> 01:19:21.780]   how user groups worked in the early 80s.
[01:19:21.780 --> 01:19:22.620]   - Yeah.
[01:19:22.620 --> 01:19:25.860]   - I just have such deep rooted nostalgia
[01:19:25.860 --> 01:19:28.100]   for these kind of videos for these things.
[01:19:28.100 --> 01:19:32.660]   Because it was just every month, 250 to 300 people
[01:19:32.660 --> 01:19:35.660]   of all skill levels getting together to get information
[01:19:35.660 --> 01:19:37.820]   that they were not gonna be able to get otherwise.
[01:19:37.820 --> 01:19:40.660]   And these were places where, okay, so,
[01:19:40.660 --> 01:19:44.860]   so here comes Bill Gates to give a talk
[01:19:44.860 --> 01:19:46.380]   and he's gonna hang around for a while to chat
[01:19:46.380 --> 01:19:47.660]   with everybody afterward.
[01:19:47.660 --> 01:19:48.580]   - Yeah, yeah, isn't that good?
[01:19:48.580 --> 01:19:50.140]   - There are handlers there, but he knows
[01:19:50.140 --> 01:19:50.980]   that, "Oh, I'm gonna use a group.
[01:19:50.980 --> 01:19:52.980]   I don't need you here because I'm talking to people
[01:19:52.980 --> 01:19:55.740]   who are not gonna, you know, not gonna say stupid things."
[01:19:55.740 --> 01:19:56.580]   - Yeah.
[01:19:56.580 --> 01:19:57.740]   - It really is.
[01:19:57.740 --> 01:20:02.380]   You know, BCS went dissolved a few years ago,
[01:20:02.380 --> 01:20:05.500]   93, 94, he was--
[01:20:05.500 --> 01:20:06.980]   - Oh, like, how?
[01:20:06.980 --> 01:20:08.940]   - It was an implosion.
[01:20:08.940 --> 01:20:13.060]   In my hanging in my office, like a few doors down,
[01:20:13.060 --> 01:20:16.660]   I have my boss in the Pure Society, Mac Group,
[01:20:16.660 --> 01:20:20.100]   trade show banner covering the entire wall of an office.
[01:20:20.100 --> 01:20:20.940]   - Wow.
[01:20:20.940 --> 01:20:23.460]   - She just reminded me of that non-cinnacle,
[01:20:23.460 --> 01:20:26.300]   that little boy who went into a meeting
[01:20:26.300 --> 01:20:28.140]   and thought the world was ahead of him
[01:20:28.140 --> 01:20:30.180]   instead of realizing that this is a world
[01:20:30.180 --> 01:20:32.380]   of crushing, crushing defeat.
[01:20:32.380 --> 01:20:34.540]   - You had the BCS on the East Coast.
[01:20:34.540 --> 01:20:37.420]   We had the Berkeley Macintosh users group, B-MUG,
[01:20:37.420 --> 01:20:38.260]   on the West Coast.
[01:20:38.260 --> 01:20:39.500]   You were going to BCS meetings.
[01:20:39.500 --> 01:20:41.380]   I was going to B-MUG meetings.
[01:20:41.380 --> 01:20:44.380]   And that was really the heyday of the user group.
[01:20:44.380 --> 01:20:47.900]   And in many ways, I think we still need user groups,
[01:20:47.900 --> 01:20:50.100]   but nobody goes to many anymore.
[01:20:50.100 --> 01:20:53.900]   - So, that's a time, techland.time.com,
[01:20:53.900 --> 01:20:57.020]   if you wanna watch that video.
[01:20:57.020 --> 01:20:59.420]   We're going to wrap things up with your picks of the week,
[01:20:59.420 --> 01:21:01.620]   gentlemen, prepare them.
[01:21:01.620 --> 01:21:05.580]   As I tell folks about squarespace.com,
[01:21:05.580 --> 01:21:08.180]   the place to go for the best hosting,
[01:21:08.180 --> 01:21:10.020]   the best content management system.
[01:21:10.020 --> 01:21:12.620]   If you wanna create a new website,
[01:21:12.620 --> 01:21:14.500]   whether it's a professional website,
[01:21:14.500 --> 01:21:17.500]   a blog, personal blog, an online portfolio,
[01:21:17.500 --> 01:21:21.060]   you wanna do e-commerce, squarespace is the place.
[01:21:21.060 --> 01:21:23.260]   They're constantly improving their platform.
[01:21:23.260 --> 01:21:26.540]   And because it's hosted, all the software's hosted by them,
[01:21:26.540 --> 01:21:28.180]   you always get the benefit of the improvements,
[01:21:28.180 --> 01:21:29.460]   the minute they come out.
[01:21:29.460 --> 01:21:31.780]   You also, by the way, don't ever have to worry about security.
[01:21:31.780 --> 01:21:34.700]   They keep it patched, they keep it secure for you.
[01:21:34.700 --> 01:21:35.860]   Beautiful designs.
[01:21:35.860 --> 01:21:37.460]   When you go to squarespace.com,
[01:21:37.460 --> 01:21:38.900]   you'll see that big get started button
[01:21:38.900 --> 01:21:42.540]   that lets you design and use squarespace for two weeks.
[01:21:42.540 --> 01:21:45.060]   No charge, no credit card necessary.
[01:21:45.060 --> 01:21:47.020]   You know, they won't ask for any personal information,
[01:21:47.020 --> 01:21:48.340]   except your email address,
[01:21:48.340 --> 01:21:51.540]   so they can email your password if you forget it.
[01:21:51.540 --> 01:21:54.780]   You start by selecting a template, 20 great templates.
[01:21:54.780 --> 01:21:57.660]   But what's nice about them is no matter what template you pick,
[01:21:57.660 --> 01:21:59.820]   you can then, without knowing any, you know,
[01:21:59.820 --> 01:22:02.900]   JavaScript or CSS, can completely customize it
[01:22:02.900 --> 01:22:05.580]   to fit your feeling, your style, what you're looking for.
[01:22:05.580 --> 01:22:07.780]   They have a number of customer websites
[01:22:07.780 --> 01:22:09.980]   using the template so you can see what people are doing.
[01:22:09.980 --> 01:22:12.860]   This is apparently a good one for photographers
[01:22:12.860 --> 01:22:17.860]   and portfolios, 'cause I see a lot of those on this template.
[01:22:17.860 --> 01:22:22.780]   So I gotta tell you, once you've created the site,
[01:22:22.780 --> 01:22:28.220]   if you are a developer, you absolutely can use,
[01:22:28.220 --> 01:22:30.900]   they have a great developer platform, JavaScript, CSS,
[01:22:30.900 --> 01:22:32.180]   but you don't have to.
[01:22:32.180 --> 01:22:33.860]   They've got amazing plugins.
[01:22:33.860 --> 01:22:35.980]   They have the ability to import your content
[01:22:35.980 --> 01:22:38.180]   from your existing site and export it to,
[01:22:38.180 --> 01:22:39.340]   so you're never trapped.
[01:22:39.340 --> 01:22:41.340]   I just love it.
[01:22:41.340 --> 01:22:44.180]   They have a new set of mobile apps.
[01:22:44.180 --> 01:22:46.700]   We've talked before about the blog app,
[01:22:46.700 --> 01:22:49.140]   this new Squarespace metric app.
[01:22:49.140 --> 01:22:53.620]   There's the blog app that lets you, you know,
[01:22:53.620 --> 01:22:54.780]   manage your blog.
[01:22:54.780 --> 01:22:57.140]   The metrics app is very sweet.
[01:22:57.140 --> 01:22:59.340]   Gives you all the information you need,
[01:22:59.340 --> 01:23:00.940]   oops, I clicked the wrong button,
[01:23:00.940 --> 01:23:03.300]   about your metrics, including page views,
[01:23:03.300 --> 01:23:07.060]   unique visitors, social media follows.
[01:23:07.060 --> 01:23:09.940]   This is really nice to have on your iPhone or your iPad.
[01:23:09.940 --> 01:23:14.580]   The hosting, the whole thing, the apps, everything,
[01:23:14.580 --> 01:23:17.500]   very affordable, as little as $8 a month
[01:23:17.500 --> 01:23:19.060]   when you buy the annual plan.
[01:23:19.060 --> 01:23:22.500]   That is a remarkable price.
[01:23:22.500 --> 01:23:24.380]   That includes everything,
[01:23:24.380 --> 01:23:26.300]   including when you buy an annual plan,
[01:23:26.300 --> 01:23:27.780]   the domain name registration,
[01:23:27.780 --> 01:23:30.420]   so you can get a domain name there as well.
[01:23:30.420 --> 01:23:33.420]   And if you want to do commerce 24 bucks a month
[01:23:33.420 --> 01:23:34.620]   and they don't take a slice,
[01:23:34.620 --> 01:23:36.380]   they have the unlimited plan,
[01:23:36.380 --> 01:23:39.140]   which is, what is that, 16 bucks a month?
[01:23:39.140 --> 01:23:41.020]   I just love Squarespace.
[01:23:41.020 --> 01:23:42.020]   Give them a try.
[01:23:42.020 --> 01:23:44.060]   You got that two week trial, no credit card need
[01:23:44.060 --> 01:23:45.140]   to start building your website.
[01:23:45.140 --> 01:23:48.580]   If you decide this is it, I want to do it.
[01:23:48.580 --> 01:23:50.540]   Make sure you use our offer code MAC break one,
[01:23:50.540 --> 01:23:52.700]   you'll get 10% off on your new account.
[01:23:52.700 --> 01:23:56.900]   Squarespace.com, click the get started button.
[01:23:56.900 --> 01:23:59.700]   Don't forget to use MAC break one
[01:23:59.700 --> 01:24:01.020]   if you decide to buy.
[01:24:01.020 --> 01:24:02.980]   We love Squarespace, they're great guys.
[01:24:02.980 --> 01:24:06.540]   Ladies and gentlemen, it's time now
[01:24:06.540 --> 01:24:08.820]   for our picks of the week.
[01:24:08.820 --> 01:24:11.300]   Let's start all the way over on my right here
[01:24:11.300 --> 01:24:14.460]   with Renee Ritchie of iMore.com, Renee.
[01:24:14.460 --> 01:24:15.740]   - So I realized a long time ago,
[01:24:15.740 --> 01:24:17.580]   there's absolutely no way to keep up with Alex
[01:24:17.580 --> 01:24:19.740]   when it comes to picks of the week.
[01:24:19.740 --> 01:24:22.620]   So what I could do though is I got my boss,
[01:24:22.620 --> 01:24:24.180]   the guy who actually founded Mobile Nations,
[01:24:24.180 --> 01:24:26.540]   he ordered the new Mac Pro, it didn't arrive yet,
[01:24:26.540 --> 01:24:28.700]   but his three 4K monitors did.
[01:24:28.700 --> 01:24:29.540]   - What?
[01:24:29.540 --> 01:24:31.900]   - He ordered the dels when they were on sale at Newegg
[01:24:31.900 --> 01:24:34.300]   and by sale, I mean, they were only like three grand
[01:24:34.300 --> 01:24:36.060]   instead of four grand or something.
[01:24:36.060 --> 01:24:38.020]   And he's self-respecting nerdy,
[01:24:38.020 --> 01:24:39.420]   wasn't gonna let them just sit there.
[01:24:39.420 --> 01:24:41.220]   So he started trying to see if he could hook them up
[01:24:41.220 --> 01:24:43.660]   to his Mac book pro.
[01:24:43.660 --> 01:24:46.420]   He started out by putting all three of them in
[01:24:46.420 --> 01:24:49.500]   and it didn't really work because they could drive
[01:24:49.500 --> 01:24:51.900]   two of the displays, but the one in the HDMI port
[01:24:51.900 --> 01:24:52.940]   would be blank.
[01:24:52.940 --> 01:24:54.420]   So he unplugged that and he found out
[01:24:54.420 --> 01:24:57.380]   if he plugged just two of them in, they would in fact work.
[01:24:57.380 --> 01:25:00.300]   There are a few problems, like Chrome does not really work
[01:25:00.300 --> 01:25:04.020]   on 4K, you have to do a bunch of hacks to get Chrome's work.
[01:25:04.020 --> 01:25:05.300]   So if you're a Chrome user,
[01:25:05.300 --> 01:25:06.620]   - Yeah.
[01:25:06.620 --> 01:25:08.500]   - Well, you know, they update it like eight times a day
[01:25:08.500 --> 01:25:09.740]   so I'm sure they'll get to it.
[01:25:09.740 --> 01:25:11.540]   - Well, it reminds me a lot of when the retinist came out
[01:25:11.540 --> 01:25:14.060]   and Chrome looked crappy for a while.
[01:25:14.060 --> 01:25:17.460]   - Chrome on Mac is like, almost like one of those movie sets
[01:25:17.460 --> 01:25:19.820]   where it looks like a real house that go behind it
[01:25:19.820 --> 01:25:22.060]   and it's held up by, yeah.
[01:25:22.060 --> 01:25:23.500]   So I mean, you can hack it together.
[01:25:23.500 --> 01:25:26.780]   The 30 mega, the 30 Hertz refresh rate,
[01:25:26.780 --> 01:25:28.860]   he says you get used to it after the cursor moves around
[01:25:28.860 --> 01:25:32.180]   for a little while, but he's now got an ungodly amount
[01:25:32.180 --> 01:25:33.500]   of pixels.
[01:25:33.500 --> 01:25:35.940]   It'll be better when OS 10 properly supports the sort
[01:25:35.940 --> 01:25:37.660]   of scaling that they do on retina displays
[01:25:37.660 --> 01:25:40.740]   where they take real retina images and downscale them
[01:25:40.740 --> 01:25:42.980]   and then size the interface appropriately.
[01:25:42.980 --> 01:25:45.220]   'Cause right now it's either really big or really small,
[01:25:45.220 --> 01:25:47.220]   but apparently you get used to that too.
[01:25:47.220 --> 01:25:49.780]   But I just like the idea that even on a Retina MacBook Pro,
[01:25:49.780 --> 01:25:52.580]   that amount of pixels cannot be enough for a human being.
[01:25:52.580 --> 01:25:53.980]   And if you have the money to spend,
[01:25:53.980 --> 01:25:57.300]   you can get a couple of 4K screens right now,
[01:25:57.300 --> 01:26:00.420]   not in February or March when your Mac Pro ships
[01:26:00.420 --> 01:26:02.540]   and enjoy them immediately.
[01:26:02.540 --> 01:26:04.820]   - And we should mention the reason you have the Apple TV
[01:26:04.820 --> 01:26:06.380]   up there is an article on your, by the way,
[01:26:06.380 --> 01:26:09.980]   that 4K display is an article on iMour.com, right?
[01:26:09.980 --> 01:26:11.420]   - Yes, we put up a help article.
[01:26:11.420 --> 01:26:12.500]   If you wanna do that at home,
[01:26:12.500 --> 01:26:15.980]   if you have a couple spare 4K screens laying around.
[01:26:15.980 --> 01:26:18.220]   - See, I have the Mac Pro, I'm the opposite.
[01:26:18.220 --> 01:26:21.260]   I have the Mac Pro, I don't have the 4K screens.
[01:26:21.260 --> 01:26:23.580]   I don't think I will either.
[01:26:23.580 --> 01:26:27.460]   - You point out that there is a tab now on the Apple store.
[01:26:27.460 --> 01:26:30.980]   You know, it's always said Shop Mac, Shop iPad, Shop iPhone.
[01:26:30.980 --> 01:26:32.500]   There's still a Shop iPad tab,
[01:26:32.500 --> 01:26:35.340]   but there's now a Shop Apple TV tab.
[01:26:35.340 --> 01:26:37.900]   Nothing new to say, but you speculate
[01:26:37.900 --> 01:26:40.900]   and you may be right, there's something new coming, you think?
[01:26:40.900 --> 01:26:43.380]   - Both Mark Gurman and I Allowing Chat articles
[01:26:43.380 --> 01:26:44.940]   up in the last couple of days saying that they'd heard
[01:26:44.940 --> 01:26:47.420]   from their sources that an update was coming up.
[01:26:47.420 --> 01:26:49.540]   I've heard similar things, but also,
[01:26:49.540 --> 01:26:50.380]   and I think I said this before,
[01:26:50.380 --> 01:26:51.940]   if you know where to look,
[01:26:51.940 --> 01:26:55.820]   the talent that has been transferred to the Apple TV division
[01:26:55.820 --> 01:26:59.500]   over the last half a year or so is astounding within Apple.
[01:26:59.500 --> 01:27:01.860]   So I mean, just the abilities of those people alone
[01:27:01.860 --> 01:27:03.540]   means there's something pretty special coming.
[01:27:03.540 --> 01:27:05.620]   - Yeah, interesting.
[01:27:05.620 --> 01:27:06.980]   We shall watch with great interest.
[01:27:06.980 --> 01:27:08.660]   Do you think it's just a software update
[01:27:08.660 --> 01:27:10.580]   or is there a new hardware?
[01:27:10.580 --> 01:27:13.180]   - Any really meaningful software updates,
[01:27:13.180 --> 01:27:14.420]   something that would let it run apps
[01:27:14.420 --> 01:27:16.300]   or let it run games would require new hardware
[01:27:16.300 --> 01:27:17.780]   because there's just so little,
[01:27:17.780 --> 01:27:19.900]   and it's an A5 chip, single core A5 chip,
[01:27:19.900 --> 01:27:21.740]   and it's only eight gigabytes of NAND flash,
[01:27:21.740 --> 01:27:23.620]   memory, which is really too little
[01:27:23.620 --> 01:27:25.900]   to do anything substantial with.
[01:27:25.900 --> 01:27:27.380]   So if they're gonna get into gaming,
[01:27:27.380 --> 01:27:29.780]   if they're gonna get into entertainment programming,
[01:27:29.780 --> 01:27:31.700]   they're gonna need to soup it up quite a bit.
[01:27:31.700 --> 01:27:35.500]   - Seems like the A7 is just be great in an Apple TV.
[01:27:35.500 --> 01:27:37.300]   - If you go to everything, Leo.
[01:27:37.300 --> 01:27:38.540]   - Yeah.
[01:27:38.540 --> 01:27:39.700]   - Good everywhere.
[01:27:39.700 --> 01:27:41.100]   I want an A7 in my house.
[01:27:41.100 --> 01:27:46.700]   Alex Lindsey in Washington, DC, your pick of the week.
[01:27:46.700 --> 01:27:47.780]   - It's cold here.
[01:27:47.780 --> 01:27:48.620]   - Is it? - No.
[01:27:48.620 --> 01:27:49.780]   - Yeah, it's cold.
[01:27:49.780 --> 01:27:51.580]   It's really cold, but I can tell exactly
[01:27:51.580 --> 01:27:53.300]   because of my pick of the week.
[01:27:53.300 --> 01:27:54.300]   I tell exactly what it's like.
[01:27:54.300 --> 01:27:58.100]   Have you seen the dark sky?
[01:27:58.100 --> 01:27:58.940]   - Yeah.
[01:27:58.940 --> 01:28:03.260]   - I really, weather means a lot,
[01:28:03.260 --> 01:28:05.980]   for our productions, and it really, yeah.
[01:28:05.980 --> 01:28:08.500]   It is so cool.
[01:28:08.500 --> 01:28:09.940]   All right, I'm sorry.
[01:28:09.940 --> 01:28:12.580]   Now it's obviously cool to see that it's overcast,
[01:28:12.580 --> 01:28:15.580]   and it's 18 and rising, but it feels like it's 12.
[01:28:15.580 --> 01:28:18.220]   And you go through it, and it's a little graph of exactly.
[01:28:18.220 --> 01:28:21.340]   I mean, it's just a really well designed, pretty,
[01:28:21.340 --> 01:28:23.860]   pretty app that visually tells you everything
[01:28:23.860 --> 01:28:25.980]   that you want when you're looking at it.
[01:28:25.980 --> 01:28:27.980]   And I don't know.
[01:28:27.980 --> 01:28:30.220]   It's like, they spend a lot of money on the weather
[01:28:30.220 --> 01:28:32.820]   for broadcast as well, and you don't know if you need
[01:28:32.820 --> 01:28:36.500]   all of this, but it sure makes the weather fun to watch.
[01:28:36.500 --> 01:28:38.260]   And there's so many things that,
[01:28:38.260 --> 01:28:39.460]   there's so much information.
[01:28:39.460 --> 01:28:42.340]   So if I scroll sideways, of course, I get more information,
[01:28:42.340 --> 01:28:47.340]   but if I scroll down, I get the actual 3D Earth
[01:28:50.300 --> 01:28:55.300]   with the actual live weather of precipitation and clouds,
[01:28:55.300 --> 01:28:57.580]   I can do precipitation or temperature,
[01:28:57.580 --> 01:28:59.380]   and I can close that.
[01:28:59.380 --> 01:29:03.780]   There's just so much information packed into it,
[01:29:03.780 --> 01:29:07.140]   but again, it doesn't overwhelm you.
[01:29:07.140 --> 01:29:09.500]   So for instance, where it says overcast, 18 feels like,
[01:29:09.500 --> 01:29:13.260]   if I tap that, I get to see wind is four miles an hour,
[01:29:13.260 --> 01:29:18.260]   humidity is 35%, pressure is 1028MB,
[01:29:18.900 --> 01:29:20.940]   and falling, visibility is 9.8 miles.
[01:29:20.940 --> 01:29:22.060]   I don't know if I need all this stuff,
[01:29:22.060 --> 01:29:25.460]   but I love the fact that it's sitting in one application
[01:29:25.460 --> 01:29:27.520]   and it's so well built and pretty.
[01:29:27.520 --> 01:29:32.420]   And anyway, it's the best weather app ever made.
[01:29:32.420 --> 01:29:35.060]   And I just love the fact that somebody went through
[01:29:35.060 --> 01:29:36.340]   the trouble to make this,
[01:29:36.340 --> 01:29:38.700]   and I was quite happy to spend $3.99,
[01:29:38.700 --> 01:29:43.700]   the cost of a latte on having this super awesome app.
[01:29:43.700 --> 01:29:46.980]   And just really showing you how all this big data,
[01:29:46.980 --> 01:29:48.060]   I know it was a big term,
[01:29:48.060 --> 01:29:52.020]   but all this data that oftentimes escapes us
[01:29:52.020 --> 01:29:54.220]   of being available is available
[01:29:54.220 --> 01:29:56.420]   and can now be on our iPhone.
[01:29:56.420 --> 01:29:58.780]   So anyway, it's really cool.
[01:29:58.780 --> 01:30:00.500]   - Buck 99. - Dark Sky.
[01:30:00.500 --> 01:30:01.700]   - Jack Adam. - Jack Adam.
[01:30:01.700 --> 01:30:02.780]   - Yep, Jack Adam.
[01:30:02.780 --> 01:30:06.700]   I'm sorry, $3.99. - Yeah.
[01:30:06.700 --> 01:30:08.380]   - I just made it cheap.
[01:30:08.380 --> 01:30:09.220]   - I asked him a lot, I was like,
[01:30:09.220 --> 01:30:10.980]   how did it drop while I was--
[01:30:10.980 --> 01:30:15.180]   - Reena, hey, Buck here, Buck there, it's worth it.
[01:30:15.180 --> 01:30:17.660]   - Based on forecast.io, which is a,
[01:30:17.660 --> 01:30:20.300]   I keep that bookmark to my web browser,
[01:30:20.300 --> 01:30:23.180]   'cause it's all the same content, and it's just great.
[01:30:23.180 --> 01:30:27.900]   Love it, good choice, Dark Sky.
[01:30:27.900 --> 01:30:30.140]   I gave it a discount, but they didn't.
[01:30:30.140 --> 01:30:32.500]   (laughing)
[01:30:32.500 --> 01:30:33.620]   - Tell Leo sent you.
[01:30:33.620 --> 01:30:35.820]   - Tell him I told him.
[01:30:35.820 --> 01:30:36.780]   Got that praise.
[01:30:36.780 --> 01:30:39.420]   - Andy and I go, you're pick of the week.
[01:30:39.420 --> 01:30:42.820]   - My pick of the week was a weather app called Dark Sky.
[01:30:42.820 --> 01:30:43.860]   - No, no. - Because it was.
[01:30:43.860 --> 01:30:45.020]   - Oh my God.
[01:30:45.020 --> 01:30:47.100]   - Andy, now with the meeting, I don't understand
[01:30:47.100 --> 01:30:49.340]   on Thermony, but we have a Google Doc
[01:30:49.340 --> 01:30:51.460]   in which nobody had picked that, and I picked it first,
[01:30:51.460 --> 01:30:52.780]   and so, but that's all right, that's fine,
[01:30:52.780 --> 01:30:54.820]   that's fine, we did it.
[01:30:54.820 --> 01:30:56.500]   I meant to put it in earlier.
[01:30:56.500 --> 01:30:57.340]   - Oh, I was there.
[01:30:57.340 --> 01:30:58.860]   - That just goes to show you.
[01:30:58.860 --> 01:31:01.580]   - Andy wins, Andy wins.
[01:31:01.580 --> 01:31:02.780]   You'll meet a dollar.
[01:31:02.780 --> 01:31:05.180]   Next time you see me, you have to give me a dollar.
[01:31:05.180 --> 01:31:06.580]   - Okay, okay, Andy.
[01:31:06.580 --> 01:31:11.020]   - Or maybe I get to keep the MacBook power
[01:31:11.020 --> 01:31:12.620]   pretty much about the house, but even a half ago
[01:31:12.620 --> 01:31:14.740]   that I keep meeting the sim back, but didn't.
[01:31:14.740 --> 01:31:16.260]   (laughing)
[01:31:16.260 --> 01:31:18.940]   But it's just an endorsement for the app.
[01:31:18.940 --> 01:31:21.100]   The other thing, I was talking about this earlier,
[01:31:21.100 --> 01:31:23.300]   that I think it's one of the first generation
[01:31:23.300 --> 01:31:25.660]   of iOS 7 apps that show you exactly why
[01:31:25.660 --> 01:31:28.740]   this was so important for Apple to make such a big change.
[01:31:28.740 --> 01:31:33.260]   It's a gorgeous app that's absolutely 100% task focused
[01:31:33.260 --> 01:31:35.980]   and provides minimal amount of information and clutter
[01:31:35.980 --> 01:31:39.740]   to provide the maximum amount of mission purpose.
[01:31:39.740 --> 01:31:41.780]   And so that's what I like.
[01:31:41.780 --> 01:31:44.260]   So instead, I'll choose two alternative picks,
[01:31:44.260 --> 01:31:46.540]   which I just ran out of the studio
[01:31:46.540 --> 01:31:48.540]   into the living room to get.
[01:31:48.540 --> 01:31:50.980]   Moonrise Kingdom, which I just bought on Amazon.
[01:31:50.980 --> 01:31:52.020]   - Love that movie.
[01:31:52.020 --> 01:31:56.340]   - Which Wes Anderson is a very divisive sort of filmmaker
[01:31:56.340 --> 01:31:58.420]   because a lot of people think he just does
[01:31:58.420 --> 01:32:01.060]   these little twee sort of things.
[01:32:01.060 --> 01:32:02.940]   This is, I think, the best movie he's made yet
[01:32:02.940 --> 01:32:06.620]   because you have to understand that it's the really
[01:32:06.620 --> 01:32:09.700]   distinctive set design and direction, the flat direction,
[01:32:09.700 --> 01:32:12.060]   the props, the cuteness.
[01:32:12.060 --> 01:32:14.780]   It really isn't in service of a larger story.
[01:32:14.780 --> 01:32:16.260]   And it's also, it's rare that you see,
[01:32:16.260 --> 01:32:18.300]   I love the fact that this is just a very, very simple,
[01:32:18.300 --> 01:32:20.460]   but very, very beautiful little story
[01:32:20.460 --> 01:32:22.780]   about two kids in their first crush.
[01:32:22.780 --> 01:32:25.700]   And now this is sort of a pre-tease.
[01:32:25.700 --> 01:32:28.460]   This is Diana Domrau's new CD,
[01:32:28.460 --> 01:32:31.820]   one of my favorite operatic sopranos.
[01:32:31.820 --> 01:32:36.820]   This is a combination of Strauss and Broadway,
[01:32:36.820 --> 01:32:39.020]   believe it or not.
[01:32:39.020 --> 01:32:42.420]   And so, A, she's absolutely fantastic.
[01:32:42.420 --> 01:32:47.420]   If you wanna do a Google search for her work at La Strada's,
[01:32:47.420 --> 01:32:50.980]   she's in La Strada doing La Bohem,
[01:32:50.980 --> 01:32:52.780]   I think we're just finished that run right now.
[01:32:52.780 --> 01:32:55.180]   Do some YouTube searches for some videos from that,
[01:32:55.180 --> 01:32:57.780]   just to show you exactly how fantastic she is.
[01:32:57.780 --> 01:33:00.220]   I was, when I found out that her next album would also have
[01:33:00.220 --> 01:33:02.740]   like stuff from West Side Story and the Phantom of the Opera
[01:33:02.740 --> 01:33:05.940]   and the Wizard of Oz and Snow White and Seven Dwarfs
[01:33:05.940 --> 01:33:07.260]   and Mary Poppins.
[01:33:07.260 --> 01:33:12.260]   When she's singing stuff from My Fair Lady,
[01:33:12.260 --> 01:33:18.300]   she is a German who is trying to sing the part of a cockney
[01:33:18.300 --> 01:33:19.140]   in German.
[01:33:19.140 --> 01:33:21.620]   So it's like it's in German.
[01:33:21.620 --> 01:33:22.980]   But it's exactly.
[01:33:22.980 --> 01:33:23.980]   (laughing)
[01:33:23.980 --> 01:33:28.700]   And these kind of songs don't often work out
[01:33:28.700 --> 01:33:30.260]   because you'll have like, you know,
[01:33:30.260 --> 01:33:32.260]   Plastno Domingo singing,
[01:33:32.260 --> 01:33:35.200]   I could have done
[01:33:35.200 --> 01:33:37.700]   (singing)
[01:33:37.700 --> 01:33:38.540]   (laughing)
[01:33:38.540 --> 01:33:39.940]   But she really knows how to mod,
[01:33:39.940 --> 01:33:41.820]   she knows how to suit her instrument,
[01:33:41.820 --> 01:33:43.260]   to suit the material.
[01:33:43.260 --> 01:33:45.900]   And it really is just absolutely light and beautiful.
[01:33:45.900 --> 01:33:50.380]   You know, Diana Domrau singing Steven Sondheim,
[01:33:50.380 --> 01:33:51.220]   that's worth it.
[01:33:51.220 --> 01:33:53.180]   Unfortunately, this is only,
[01:33:53.180 --> 01:33:55.660]   it's not available in the US yet because we're dummies
[01:33:55.660 --> 01:33:57.500]   and we don't like beautiful music,
[01:33:57.500 --> 01:33:58.700]   but you can special order it
[01:33:58.700 --> 01:34:01.540]   and it's about the cost of a regular CD anyway.
[01:34:01.540 --> 01:34:02.580]   I kept, this is,
[01:34:02.580 --> 01:34:05.340]   if anybody at Warner Classics is listening to this,
[01:34:05.340 --> 01:34:08.100]   I've been trying to get the US release dates
[01:34:08.100 --> 01:34:10.100]   actually waited like a month and a half
[01:34:10.100 --> 01:34:12.100]   thinking that was gonna be released in the US.
[01:34:12.100 --> 01:34:14.180]   Then I emailed them directly and they said,
[01:34:14.180 --> 01:34:15.380]   "Oh, it is available in the US."
[01:34:15.380 --> 01:34:16.980]   And I said, "No, it isn't."
[01:34:16.980 --> 01:34:18.580]   And they didn't know what the,
[01:34:18.580 --> 01:34:21.620]   someone at your company thinks it's being released at the US,
[01:34:21.620 --> 01:34:24.100]   but it hasn't been yet and it needs to be released
[01:34:24.100 --> 01:34:26.540]   and because it's really, really quite cool.
[01:34:26.540 --> 01:34:27.380]   So that's my,
[01:34:27.380 --> 01:34:29.860]   that's my desperate alternative picks of the week.
[01:34:29.860 --> 01:34:33.220]   If also, CVS brand flexible bandages, no.
[01:34:33.220 --> 01:34:34.660]   (laughing)
[01:34:34.660 --> 01:34:39.060]   90% of all infections are not due to CZ flies,
[01:34:39.060 --> 01:34:41.180]   due to a simple cut that has not been sterilized
[01:34:41.180 --> 01:34:42.500]   and dedicated with this,
[01:34:42.500 --> 01:34:44.180]   the budget brand flexible fabric,
[01:34:44.180 --> 01:34:46.220]   it's slightly waterproof and smells really good
[01:34:46.220 --> 01:34:48.140]   after three days and you haven't changed it yet.
[01:34:48.140 --> 01:34:49.700]   CVS flexible fabric.
[01:34:49.700 --> 01:34:50.700]   - Patterson and our, - It's where
[01:34:50.700 --> 01:34:53.780]   - Patterson and our chat room gave the single most
[01:34:53.780 --> 01:34:59.660]   incorrect thumbnail of Moonrise Kingdom
[01:34:59.660 --> 01:35:01.740]   that is actually factually perfectly correct.
[01:35:01.740 --> 01:35:03.900]   He said, "It's a Bruce Willis movie."
[01:35:03.900 --> 01:35:07.380]   And it's technically true.
[01:35:07.380 --> 01:35:08.220]   (laughing)
[01:35:08.220 --> 01:35:09.060]   And it's like,
[01:35:09.060 --> 01:35:11.820]   "I want to see Bruce Willis do more roles like this."
[01:35:11.820 --> 01:35:14.780]   - Technically true, but it's not a Bruce Willis.
[01:35:14.780 --> 01:35:17.580]   - No, he was clearly cast to type,
[01:35:17.580 --> 01:35:19.180]   but with the awareness that blows funny.
[01:35:19.180 --> 01:35:22.020]   - This Bruce Willis can not only be the guy who like climbs,
[01:35:22.020 --> 01:35:24.540]   climbs into a dangerous situation to save someone,
[01:35:24.540 --> 01:35:26.780]   but he can also be the guy who is very, very sad
[01:35:26.780 --> 01:35:28.980]   and disappointed with himself and the world around him.
[01:35:28.980 --> 01:35:30.660]   And by the way, I will have to take on,
[01:35:30.660 --> 01:35:31.500]   - Don't worry.
[01:35:31.500 --> 01:35:32.580]   - Take issue with one thing you said,
[01:35:32.580 --> 01:35:34.700]   it is not Wes Anderson's best movie.
[01:35:34.700 --> 01:35:37.500]   That title goes to the fantastic Mr. Fox.
[01:35:37.500 --> 01:35:40.260]   - Okay, but we can argue.
[01:35:40.260 --> 01:35:43.220]   - I will amend that happily to their,
[01:35:43.220 --> 01:35:45.060]   I don't believe that he has made a better film
[01:35:45.060 --> 01:35:45.900]   than Moonrise Kingdom.
[01:35:45.900 --> 01:35:46.740]   - That may be true.
[01:35:46.740 --> 01:35:47.660]   - Yeah. - He has been on my
[01:35:47.660 --> 01:35:49.500]   - Love Moon, I love, and he's got a new one coming out.
[01:35:49.500 --> 01:35:51.700]   What is that, is Tim Bullhotel or something?
[01:35:51.700 --> 01:35:54.380]   - A hotel, something.
[01:35:54.380 --> 01:35:56.140]   - Accum or real, but good.
[01:35:56.140 --> 01:35:59.700]   - It's, and the undersea world of Steve Zisou,
[01:35:59.700 --> 01:36:02.100]   or what's his name Zisou is very good to.
[01:36:02.100 --> 01:36:03.620]   Yes, yes.
[01:36:03.620 --> 01:36:06.020]   But I think fantastic, Mr. Fox.
[01:36:06.020 --> 01:36:08.340]   So that's my personal vote.
[01:36:08.340 --> 01:36:10.660]   So, and the Royal Ten of Bombs, now you can't,
[01:36:10.660 --> 01:36:12.260]   yes, see, you see, you see, you can't.
[01:36:12.260 --> 01:36:13.100]   - I don't think I'm smart,
[01:36:13.100 --> 01:36:13.940]   - They're all good for Wes Anderson.
[01:36:13.940 --> 01:36:15.260]   - That's gonna be what Helva Box said.
[01:36:15.260 --> 01:36:17.020]   - It's an acquired taste.
[01:36:17.020 --> 01:36:18.940]   - I got, I get about halfway through them
[01:36:18.940 --> 01:36:21.100]   and I'm like, okay, it's not, I fall asleep.
[01:36:21.100 --> 01:36:22.180]   - Yeah.
[01:36:22.180 --> 01:36:24.020]   - I just, there's not enough, there's not enough,
[01:36:24.020 --> 01:36:24.900]   there's not enough edits.
[01:36:24.900 --> 01:36:26.780]   - The grand Buddha Pezotel.
[01:36:26.780 --> 01:36:28.620]   - Very long shot. - Alex.
[01:36:28.620 --> 01:36:32.780]   - Now, do you have just like a gaping void in your chest
[01:36:32.780 --> 01:36:34.660]   or when they took out your heart
[01:36:34.660 --> 01:36:37.460]   they split like something hard and black and cold
[01:36:37.460 --> 01:36:38.620]   in its place?
[01:36:38.620 --> 01:36:41.780]   - I just, episode one.
[01:36:41.780 --> 01:36:42.900]   - I don't sleep very much,
[01:36:42.900 --> 01:36:45.300]   so I'm really good as long as things keep moving.
[01:36:45.300 --> 01:36:48.540]   And so, but if I sit down and if we get to like slow,
[01:36:48.540 --> 01:36:51.900]   and it's, all I will say is that there is a scene
[01:36:51.900 --> 01:36:54.980]   in which Bill Murray emerges from a closet,
[01:36:54.980 --> 01:36:59.220]   naked from the chest up, holding a bottle of red wine
[01:36:59.220 --> 01:37:01.180]   in one hand and an axe in the other
[01:37:01.180 --> 01:37:02.740]   and modestly announces,
[01:37:02.740 --> 01:37:05.660]   I wanna go in the backyard and find something to chop down.
[01:37:05.660 --> 01:37:08.380]   And then walks across the scene and leaves from the other door.
[01:37:08.380 --> 01:37:11.660]   - In this kind of oddly constricted set,
[01:37:11.660 --> 01:37:13.740]   it is, you know, any movie with Bill Murray
[01:37:13.740 --> 01:37:15.420]   is a good movie, I think.
[01:37:15.420 --> 01:37:17.460]   - Well, I'm just gonna move,
[01:37:17.460 --> 01:37:20.100]   I'm just gonna say we've spent enough time on all of this
[01:37:20.100 --> 01:37:24.700]   and say I move for adjournment, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:37:24.700 --> 01:37:25.540]   - Seconded.
[01:37:25.540 --> 01:37:28.820]   - Do I hear any nays?
[01:37:28.820 --> 01:37:31.060]   All in favor?
[01:37:31.060 --> 01:37:32.860]   Let's go.
[01:37:32.860 --> 01:37:34.580]   (laughing)
[01:37:34.580 --> 01:37:35.500]   - The motion carries.
[01:37:35.500 --> 01:37:36.900]   - Say we all.
[01:37:36.900 --> 01:37:38.260]   - So say we all.
[01:37:38.260 --> 01:37:39.740]   Renee Richie is at imore.com,
[01:37:39.740 --> 01:37:42.620]   a better place there is not for Mac news,
[01:37:42.620 --> 01:37:43.900]   but all sorts of great stuff too.
[01:37:43.900 --> 01:37:46.340]   And you'll find it on the web.
[01:37:46.340 --> 01:37:48.660]   In your favorite browser, his podcasts are there too.
[01:37:48.660 --> 01:37:50.300]   Thank you, Renee, for being here.
[01:37:50.300 --> 01:37:55.300]   And I bet you can tap Alex Lindsey's polar vortex of 18 degrees.
[01:37:55.300 --> 01:37:57.500]   - It was so cold, my mom called me
[01:37:57.500 --> 01:37:59.340]   and said she was watching TV in gloves.
[01:37:59.340 --> 01:38:00.900]   (laughing)
[01:38:00.900 --> 01:38:02.300]   I was blogging with my hoodie up.
[01:38:02.300 --> 01:38:04.700]   It was just a cool amount of heat could counteract it.
[01:38:04.700 --> 01:38:06.500]   - But Canadians are made for that weather,
[01:38:06.500 --> 01:38:07.660]   they're made for it.
[01:38:07.660 --> 01:38:08.660]   - Well, I don't understand Leo,
[01:38:08.660 --> 01:38:12.100]   is that people crossed from Siberia over the land bridge
[01:38:12.100 --> 01:38:13.620]   and then were so tired of walking,
[01:38:13.620 --> 01:38:15.540]   they stopped in the Arctic Circle.
[01:38:15.540 --> 01:38:17.220]   And the ones who kept walking to Florida
[01:38:17.220 --> 01:38:18.780]   hated them so much they never went back
[01:38:18.780 --> 01:38:19.860]   and told him it got warmer.
[01:38:19.860 --> 01:38:22.540]   (laughing)
[01:38:22.540 --> 01:38:25.580]   - By the way, the dark healing limit is not on that list.
[01:38:25.580 --> 01:38:28.340]   - I would agree.
[01:38:28.340 --> 01:38:29.180]   - Yes, sorry.
[01:38:29.180 --> 01:38:31.620]   - Not every movie can be amongst his very best movies.
[01:38:31.620 --> 01:38:34.460]   I would say the motorized kingdom was one.
[01:38:34.460 --> 01:38:36.820]   I would agree with Fantastic Mr. Fox,
[01:38:36.820 --> 01:38:38.420]   Moonrise Kingdom and Tannenbaum's.
[01:38:38.420 --> 01:38:39.260]   - There you go.
[01:38:39.260 --> 01:38:40.100]   - As we agree very best.
[01:38:40.100 --> 01:38:40.940]   - Excellent movies.
[01:38:40.940 --> 01:38:41.940]   - But I don't think he's ever made a bad movie.
[01:38:41.940 --> 01:38:43.940]   - Yeah, I hope you if you have not seen any of these,
[01:38:43.940 --> 01:38:46.700]   you go out and I hope you do not have Alex Lindsey's reaction.
[01:38:46.700 --> 01:38:48.700]   Alex is in Washington DC for a reason.
[01:38:48.700 --> 01:38:51.020]   - I think they're great movies, they just fall asleep.
[01:38:51.020 --> 01:38:51.860]   - Yeah.
[01:38:51.860 --> 01:38:52.700]   - It's like he's really good movies.
[01:38:52.700 --> 01:38:53.940]   - They're soothing.
[01:38:53.940 --> 01:38:54.780]   - Exactly.
[01:38:54.780 --> 01:38:55.620]   - They're soothing.
[01:38:55.620 --> 01:38:56.460]   - They're like lullabies.
[01:38:56.460 --> 01:38:57.300]   - Yeah.
[01:38:57.300 --> 01:38:59.260]   Alex Lindsey is in Washington DC for no apparent reason.
[01:38:59.260 --> 01:39:01.380]   We won't delve deeper,
[01:39:01.380 --> 01:39:03.820]   but he is also at the pixelcore.com
[01:39:03.820 --> 01:39:08.020]   and you can follow him @AlexLindsay for further clues.
[01:39:08.020 --> 01:39:10.180]   - Yes, yes.
[01:39:10.180 --> 01:39:11.980]   - Lots of posts on G+ usually.
[01:39:11.980 --> 01:39:14.780]   - Yes, G+ is probably the better place, yeah.
[01:39:14.780 --> 01:39:17.780]   And of course, the wonderful, the talented Andy Inaco
[01:39:17.780 --> 01:39:19.820]   from the Chicago Sun-Times.
[01:39:19.820 --> 01:39:21.980]   We gather together, all of us.
[01:39:21.980 --> 01:39:22.820]   What is that picture?
[01:39:22.820 --> 01:39:24.420]   Is that area 51?
[01:39:24.420 --> 01:39:25.300]   What is that?
[01:39:25.300 --> 01:39:28.420]   - No, that is, I believe the opportunity rover on Mars.
[01:39:28.420 --> 01:39:29.260]   - No, that's Mars.
[01:39:29.260 --> 01:39:30.780]   - After 10 years.
[01:39:30.780 --> 01:39:34.620]   - We got a panel of Mars from a 10 year old rover.
[01:39:34.620 --> 01:39:35.460]   - Exactly.
[01:39:35.460 --> 01:39:36.300]   - Unbelievable.
[01:39:36.300 --> 01:39:39.340]   - I like the fact that we're all for like, you know,
[01:39:39.340 --> 01:39:41.820]   international like brotherhood of scientists,
[01:39:41.820 --> 01:39:42.780]   but there are a whole bunch of people
[01:39:42.780 --> 01:39:44.460]   who could not help but point out that,
[01:39:44.460 --> 01:39:47.340]   yeah, we've had Mars rovers that were supposed to last a month
[01:39:47.340 --> 01:39:48.860]   and they've been running for 10 years.
[01:39:48.860 --> 01:39:52.660]   China, oh, too bad that your 30 day lunar rover
[01:39:52.660 --> 01:39:55.260]   only crapped out after about 10 days.
[01:39:55.260 --> 01:39:58.580]   You'll get, oh, I think it's adorable you even tried.
[01:39:58.580 --> 01:40:01.460]   - Don't be mean.
[01:40:01.460 --> 01:40:04.540]   - Everybody, good, everyone let's say good job China
[01:40:04.540 --> 01:40:05.540]   lunar rover people.
[01:40:05.540 --> 01:40:07.020]   - Good job China.
[01:40:07.020 --> 01:40:09.180]   - Good job China.
[01:40:09.180 --> 01:40:10.900]   - As he is, as a pod.
[01:40:10.900 --> 01:40:13.340]   - Legitably I'm glad they're putting probes on that.
[01:40:13.340 --> 01:40:14.420]   - Yeah.
[01:40:14.420 --> 01:40:16.540]   - So this is the first photo,
[01:40:16.540 --> 01:40:18.860]   if you look up in the corner, it works.
[01:40:18.860 --> 01:40:21.140]   This is when it first landed.
[01:40:21.140 --> 01:40:23.900]   And now this is after a decade of Russian,
[01:40:23.900 --> 01:40:26.140]   or Russian of Martian fine.
[01:40:26.140 --> 01:40:27.100]   - It needs to be a squeegee guy.
[01:40:27.100 --> 01:40:28.100]   - Yeah, look at that.
[01:40:28.100 --> 01:40:29.220]   It's a little dusty.
[01:40:29.220 --> 01:40:30.700]   - It's a little dusty.
[01:40:30.700 --> 01:40:33.940]   - But it's there and it's working and we got a panel.
[01:40:33.940 --> 01:40:37.300]   - That is the inside of your cheese grater Mac Pro.
[01:40:37.300 --> 01:40:38.140]   - Half selfie.
[01:40:38.140 --> 01:40:41.100]   - So that's a selfie, but there's also a panel that it sent back.
[01:40:41.100 --> 01:40:43.300]   Yeah, really a beautiful panel.
[01:40:43.300 --> 01:40:45.460]   - Yes, that's right, it's a rover selfie.
[01:40:45.460 --> 01:40:46.940]   - Well Martian probe selfie.
[01:40:46.940 --> 01:40:50.180]   - I'm a little dusty, but,
[01:40:50.180 --> 01:40:52.180]   and somewhat the worst aware.
[01:40:52.180 --> 01:40:53.820]   - But I'm alive. - It's time Leo.
[01:40:53.820 --> 01:40:54.860]   - How it lasted so long.
[01:40:54.860 --> 01:40:56.420]   - It's amazing. - We were made to suffer.
[01:40:56.420 --> 01:40:57.660]   It is all not in life.
[01:40:57.660 --> 01:41:02.500]   - I'm gonna paint on the diodes all up and down my left side.
[01:41:02.500 --> 01:41:05.100]   We do this show 11 a.m. Pacific every Tuesday.
[01:41:05.100 --> 01:41:08.660]   That's 2 p.m. Eastern time 1900 UTC on twit.tv.
[01:41:08.660 --> 01:41:12.700]   If you watch live, you will be rewarded.
[01:41:13.380 --> 01:41:15.420]   Somehow, maybe in a later life.
[01:41:15.420 --> 01:41:18.260]   If you do not, you will always get in a future life.
[01:41:18.260 --> 01:41:21.060]   You will always be able to watch on demand audio and video
[01:41:21.060 --> 01:41:26.060]   after the fact twit.tv/mbw or on youtube.com/macbreakweekly.
[01:41:26.060 --> 01:41:29.540]   Probably.
[01:41:29.540 --> 01:41:34.820]   Or, you know, on your favorite pod catcher, try iTunes.
[01:41:34.820 --> 01:41:36.420]   I hear it's good.
[01:41:36.420 --> 01:41:37.260]   Thanks for being here.
[01:41:37.260 --> 01:41:39.700]   Now get back to work 'cause breakdown is over.
[01:41:39.700 --> 01:41:41.620]   Like a man.
[01:41:42.460 --> 01:41:44.700]   (laughing)
[01:41:44.700 --> 01:41:47.280]   (upbeat music)
[01:41:47.280 --> 01:41:49.860]   (upbeat music)
[01:41:49.860 --> 01:41:52.440]   (upbeat music)
