[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   You've been on vacation, it's nice.
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000]   No, no, I've just been able to do a lot more from here.
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000]   Yeah, Carly, this is happy.
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.000]   Yes, the kids are happy.
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.000]   Kids are happy.
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   Also with us Renee Richie from iMOR with his gold phone.
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   We'll talk about that momentarily.
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   Hi Renee.
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:54.000]   Hi Leo.
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.000]   Gold.
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   It's cold.
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.000]   On the other side, we've got Alex, I'm sorry, Andy Anaco from the Chicago Sun Times.
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   Hello, Andy.
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   Hello.
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   Hello.
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   I can't break my NDA, but the new iPhone will be one of these colors.
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   Andy took that phone with a Moto X.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   I know because I read your Google+.
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   He's reviewing that right now.
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.000]   We'll ask him about that.
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   And also, it's good to see you.
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   I haven't seen any ages.
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   The body of Breen and the hair of Breen together at last in the body of Chris Breen of Macworld.
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   Hello Leo.
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   Hello Chris, our album of the day.
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.000]   Wait a minute, don't tell me.
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   That looks awfully familiar.
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   Oh man, I know that album.
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   Is it, I want to say Dan Hicks and his hot licks.
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   No, no, wait a minute.
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   No, no, no, no.
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   It's Janice Joplin and the holding company.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   No, no, no.
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   It's a big brother.
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   It's definitely an R-crumb.
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   What is it?
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   It's a money holding a cricket path.
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   It's not a cricket path.
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   It's got to give you other side of the ocean.
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   It's not a...
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   Other side of the is British.
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   It's, he's holding him, he's holding a muffler.
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   Come on, you can do it.
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   Somebody here can get this.
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   Come on, chat room.
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   Album of the day.
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   We don't know.
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   Nobody knows.
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   Nobody can tell.
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   Oh really?
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   Chris, your hair is in the way.
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   Sorry.
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   God, your hair really is getting flamboyant.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   I just want to say you look like...
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   Oh, yeah.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   Is it an old John Smoky album?
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   No.
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   Is it the...
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   No.
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   What is it?
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   It is the original American cover version of David Bowie's The Man Who Sold the World.
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   Oh.
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   I don't think I would have gotten that.
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   Who's it by?
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:27.000]   I would not.
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   David Bowie.
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   It's a...
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   Boy racer got it.
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   Yeah.
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   What?
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   Mercury label.
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   It was the first pressing of the release in this country before David Bowie was like...
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   Oh, that is not a Bowie cover.
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   That really does not look like a Bowie cover, does it?
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   No, it's like somebody did a cartoon for him.
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   That's good.
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   There's a man-helding a muffler.
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   He's wearing a cowboy hat.
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   It's great album.
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   It's really a...
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   They're looking into the future.
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   Someday somebody's going to pay like $300 for this cover.
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   I think you're right.
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:03.000]   30 years from now.
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   Yes, I hope it's untouched in the box.
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   Sealed.
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   No.
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   No, it's completely trashed.
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   What year was that?
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000]   1973?
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   Yeah, it was like 1970.
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.000]   Yeah.
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   Early.
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:21.000]   Long time ago.
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:22.000]   It was early.
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   Yeah, this was before space oddity.
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:26.000]   Oh, yes.
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:31.000]   He had changed his name from David Jones.
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   David Jones.
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:33.000]   David Jones.
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   Is that ironic?
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.000]   The Davy Jones changed his name to Davy Jones.
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.000]   And the Davy Jones changed his name to David Bowie.
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   Yeah.
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   David Bowie lives today.
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:45.000]   I ask you.
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000]   Let's send that to David Bowie as one of the monkeys.
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   That's all.
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   That would be awesome.
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   You're welcome.
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   Walking down the street.
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.000]   Ziggy Stardust and his band.
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   So really, that's not what we're here today to discuss.
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:01.000]   We're here today to discuss what is over Renee Richie's right shoulder.
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000]   A gold iPhone.
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   Well, I'm sorry.
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000]   It's not gold, it's champagne.
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   Yes.
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.000]   So, okay.
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:11.000]   There's, okay.
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:16.400]   I got to put you and Andy on the spot because you told me there'd be no fingerprint reader.
[00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:19.000]   You were pretty sure, I'm sure you had him in about that.
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000]   You told, I don't know if we even talked gold iPhone.
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000]   I think I pooped that.
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:27.000]   I'm still pooping and it seems bizarre.
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   So what's the story?
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   You have the scoop.
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:35.800]   I started asking because the analyst who was talking about it is one of the only, there's
[00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:36.800]   different kinds of analysts.
[00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:39.000]   There's financial analysts and industry analysts.
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   Financial analysts are chronically unreliable, but among financial analysts, and I don't
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:45.000]   remember how to pronounce his name.
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:46.000]   Minkchi Kuo.
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   Minkchi Kuo, that's correct.
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.600]   He said it two or three times and he's one of the more reliable ones.
[00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:56.000]   So I started asking around and on Friday I managed to get at least two people to confirm.
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.600]   I don't want to use the word confirm, but to tell me that yes, indeed, there is a gold
[00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:04.000]   iPhone 5S and it will be available along with the other models.
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.600]   So no Sapphire Audi belly button on it, but a gold iPhone.
[00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:13.880]   So this is not the color iPhone, the 5C, the less expensive iPhone.
[00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:14.880]   This is the main line.
[00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:17.000]   There'll be black, white and champagne.
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:21.040]   Yeah, for people who some people think it's going to be like C3PO gold, but it's really
[00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:23.600]   going to be with a silver and white model now.
[00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:24.600]   It's a totally.
[00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:26.600]   Is that the Pantone color?
[00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:27.600]   C3PO.
[00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:28.600]   I'm kind of like your car.
[00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:30.600]   I would like it to be C3PO gold.
[00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:33.320]   I'm hoping for a crow.
[00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:37.440]   So somebody in the chat room said this is the Paris Hilton edition, Boffin says.
[00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:38.440]   It's just light.
[00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:41.760]   Like if you imagine the current white and silver iPhone and he just bring it a little
[00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:48.000]   bit towards gold and I started trying to think why Apple would do this and you know, they're
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:49.520]   it's six years into their product cycle.
[00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:51.200]   Now it's a mature product.
[00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:55.240]   There's not going to be any big outward differentiator between the five and the five S the way
[00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:59.000]   there are when they when they actually change the physical design on those years.
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:03.640]   It's more competitive than ever and doing something as simple as using gold and anodization,
[00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:09.240]   which is also the easiest color to anodize and I'm on much easier than black.
[00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:11.520]   Real black is really hard, but gold is easy.
[00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:14.880]   Just add a little bit of iron oxide and you know, voila, the chemical reaction takes over
[00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:16.120]   for you.
[00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:17.400]   It makes it's easy to do.
[00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:20.200]   It adds a little bit of variety to the lineup.
[00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:22.480]   Gold is not a low end sort of a color.
[00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:24.800]   So it kind of preserves the iPhone as a premium product.
[00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:27.040]   Kind of a tacky color, some say though.
[00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:32.800]   Well, Kim Kardashian, but it turns out that the vast majority of aftermarket iPhone colorings
[00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:37.680]   are gold people more than half the people who want to get their iPhone colored after
[00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:39.680]   they buy it from Apple go for the gold option.
[00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:42.840]   I also see a lot of the jeweled cases out there, but I don't think people are going
[00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:44.480]   to do the Apple would ever do that.
[00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:45.480]   You know, I have.
[00:07:45.480 --> 00:07:48.640]   Okay, I put the new add the new Apple ad for it in the in the notes.
[00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:49.640]   Oh, good.
[00:07:49.640 --> 00:07:50.880]   Let's let's play that ad.
[00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:51.880]   Chad.
[00:07:51.880 --> 00:07:52.880]   You know what?
[00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:53.880]   I looked at it.
[00:07:53.880 --> 00:07:56.280]   I've been completely dismissive.
[00:07:56.280 --> 00:07:58.000]   I want to.
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:07:59.560]   I'm such a sheep.
[00:07:59.560 --> 00:08:00.560]   I want it.
[00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:01.560]   You're going to get it.
[00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:02.560]   I want it.
[00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:03.560]   Here's the add.
[00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:04.560]   I like the best.
[00:08:04.560 --> 00:08:14.080]   See, this is the most one, but I also like savings the money.
[00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:19.160]   So when direct TV tell me five months free for most premium televisions package.
[00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:22.960]   I'm quite glad I'm here, Putin, but very close young.
[00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:24.480]   So is this for the Russian market?
[00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:26.520]   Is that what we're making a gold iPhone?
[00:08:26.520 --> 00:08:27.520]   I love it.
[00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:28.520]   I love it.
[00:08:28.520 --> 00:08:30.520]   First of all, gold giraffe.
[00:08:30.520 --> 00:08:32.520]   Don't tell me that a teacup giraffe.
[00:08:32.520 --> 00:08:33.520]   It would not sell.
[00:08:33.520 --> 00:08:34.520]   It would sell.
[00:08:34.520 --> 00:08:39.560]   I think it should be a phone gold or balance.
[00:08:39.560 --> 00:08:42.200]   I has it.
[00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:44.760]   So what do you guys think?
[00:08:44.760 --> 00:08:46.240]   I think it's very likely.
[00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:50.200]   I think I think in some of the other cultures, I think that they are it's very popular.
[00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:52.160]   And I think that there's quite a few people in the 90s.
[00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:54.160]   They'll buy a gold one.
[00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:55.520]   I mean, it's fine.
[00:08:55.520 --> 00:08:57.320]   I'm not going to buy it.
[00:08:57.320 --> 00:08:59.480]   Yeah, maybe it'd be cool to think of it.
[00:08:59.480 --> 00:09:01.280]   This is the go ahead, Chris.
[00:09:01.280 --> 00:09:02.280]   Go ahead, Chris.
[00:09:02.280 --> 00:09:06.800]   Maybe this is the phone that you don't want to use after Labor Day.
[00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:07.800]   The white shoe phone.
[00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:10.360]   The white shoes and the white slacks.
[00:09:10.360 --> 00:09:12.120]   You're done until next season.
[00:09:12.120 --> 00:09:16.440]   So it becomes your seasonal iPhone that as you're in the hamsters, the Hamptons, you
[00:09:16.440 --> 00:09:19.360]   bring out your gold iPhone and then you use it.
[00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:24.360]   But otherwise, I think midwinter, except around the holiday season, it's a little tacky.
[00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:25.360]   It's a little much.
[00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:27.840]   So I think it will do very well in Palm Desert.
[00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:30.080]   It will do very well in Florida.
[00:09:30.080 --> 00:09:31.560]   Hollywood will be fine.
[00:09:31.560 --> 00:09:35.280]   Those kind of kitschy countries will do OK with it as well.
[00:09:35.280 --> 00:09:38.640]   But I don't see your normal geek carrying this thing around.
[00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:39.640]   Yeah.
[00:09:39.640 --> 00:09:43.240]   But I couldn't help but think of that episode of The Simpsons where Lisa decides she wants
[00:09:43.240 --> 00:09:48.800]   to revolutionize the child's doll industry and spends the entire episode and gets all
[00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:54.600]   kinds of celebrity feminist experts in to develop this brand new wonderful role model
[00:09:54.600 --> 00:09:59.440]   positive doll that turns out that all the girls want and then the Malibu Stacy, the Barbie
[00:09:59.440 --> 00:10:01.520]   people decide we have to head this off.
[00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:05.600]   Why don't we just bring out the same old Malibu Stacy only now with the new hat and then all
[00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:07.680]   the girls want the Malibu Stacy with the new hat.
[00:10:07.680 --> 00:10:11.240]   I think the gold tone might be Malibu iPhone with the new hat.
[00:10:11.240 --> 00:10:12.240]   That's all.
[00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:13.240]   Yeah.
[00:10:13.240 --> 00:10:15.240]   Especially like this year we've seen like so many other cool smones.
[00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:16.680]   No, nothing wrong with that.
[00:10:16.680 --> 00:10:21.320]   I think that Apple is missing a trick by only having black and white because people do like
[00:10:21.320 --> 00:10:23.840]   to do like to personalize a phone.
[00:10:23.840 --> 00:10:27.360]   They do like to have something that really is identifiably theirs.
[00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:30.760]   And although that I don't think they can on the iPhone 5, they can make like nine different
[00:10:30.760 --> 00:10:33.000]   colors and keep that kind of supply chain going.
[00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:39.320]   But if they are, if one way to remind people that this is still a cool modern phone is
[00:10:39.320 --> 00:10:42.680]   to introduce a new metallic color, that's good.
[00:10:42.680 --> 00:10:46.920]   I think that the iPhone 5 got sort of slammed a little bit because it didn't look all that
[00:10:46.920 --> 00:10:50.520]   different and it sort of swept aside the idea that while the camera is very much improved,
[00:10:50.520 --> 00:10:52.120]   the CPU is much improved.
[00:10:52.120 --> 00:10:53.440]   They changed so much about it.
[00:10:53.440 --> 00:10:57.960]   The fact that it doesn't have like a transformer set of hover wheels on it doesn't mean that
[00:10:57.960 --> 00:10:59.880]   it's not a new great phone.
[00:10:59.880 --> 00:11:02.680]   Sometimes if you want to give the people what they want to convince them that there is something
[00:11:02.680 --> 00:11:04.960]   new going on, psychology cells.
[00:11:04.960 --> 00:11:07.480]   So aren't we being apologists?
[00:11:07.480 --> 00:11:10.520]   This is such a shock to have this from Apple.
[00:11:10.520 --> 00:11:11.520]   Isn't it?
[00:11:11.520 --> 00:11:12.520]   You know, give me the donation of colors.
[00:11:12.520 --> 00:11:13.520]   I'm Mac and they made the-
[00:11:13.520 --> 00:11:14.520]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:11:14.520 --> 00:11:16.400]   Yeah, the flower power I'm Mac.
[00:11:16.400 --> 00:11:17.400]   Yeah.
[00:11:17.400 --> 00:11:19.880]   How well did that sell?
[00:11:19.880 --> 00:11:21.600]   I'm guessing it wasn't the top seller.
[00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:22.600]   Yeah.
[00:11:22.600 --> 00:11:23.600]   What does it look like?
[00:11:23.600 --> 00:11:24.600]   It was awesome.
[00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:28.000]   I mean, people are accessorizing all of their iPhones anyway with cases and all kinds of
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:29.000]   other stuff.
[00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:32.880]   It's just Apple making money on it instead.
[00:11:32.880 --> 00:11:33.880]   All right.
[00:11:33.880 --> 00:11:34.880]   There's one-
[00:11:34.880 --> 00:11:35.880]   People play to their egos, Tilly.
[00:11:35.880 --> 00:11:38.480]   I mean, one of the biggest criticisms we keep hearing is that people are like, "Oh, no one's
[00:11:38.480 --> 00:11:39.880]   going to know I have the new one.
[00:11:39.880 --> 00:11:42.480]   I need people to know that I have the new one."
[00:11:42.480 --> 00:11:43.480]   That's a big-
[00:11:43.480 --> 00:11:44.480]   It is a big thing.
[00:11:44.480 --> 00:11:45.480]   Usually, Apple-
[00:11:45.480 --> 00:11:49.320]   I mean, come on, Andy, you're the guy who says, "Put Apple up on the pedestal.
[00:11:49.320 --> 00:11:51.480]   Say Apple wouldn't do that.
[00:11:51.480 --> 00:11:52.480]   It doesn't-
[00:11:52.480 --> 00:11:54.080]   They don't need to pander, right?"
[00:11:54.080 --> 00:11:55.080]   I don't-
[00:11:55.080 --> 00:11:56.160]   Well, no, this is-
[00:11:56.160 --> 00:11:59.200]   I don't think this is pandering at all.
[00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:02.440]   I mean, if they have numbers saying that this is a really, really popular color and
[00:12:02.440 --> 00:12:06.320]   they are thinking that perhaps black and white is getting a little too boring for their taste,
[00:12:06.320 --> 00:12:10.880]   and if, as rumor has it, there's going to be another phone that has lots and lots-
[00:12:10.880 --> 00:12:16.440]   Less expensive and have lots and lots of colors, isn't it smart to sort of extend that conversation
[00:12:16.440 --> 00:12:20.440]   by saying, "And we've decided to add a third color to the iPhone, top of the line iPhone
[00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:21.440]   5S as well."
[00:12:21.440 --> 00:12:25.600]   I don't think that's a bad thing at all, giving people options to have something that's
[00:12:25.600 --> 00:12:28.160]   a little bit more personal, a little bit more to their taste.
[00:12:28.160 --> 00:12:29.480]   That doesn't mess around with anything.
[00:12:29.480 --> 00:12:34.600]   The problem comes when they decide to, "We're going to make a stylish new phone because
[00:12:34.600 --> 00:12:38.400]   it has to look visually different from the last one or else people won't have that sort
[00:12:38.400 --> 00:12:40.560]   of premium brand.
[00:12:40.560 --> 00:12:42.640]   Hey, I'm part of the best and the brightest.
[00:12:42.640 --> 00:12:45.280]   I don't care that I still had 12 months left on my contract.
[00:12:45.280 --> 00:12:49.520]   I paid the fee because I want to be seen as having the new version of the iPhone."
[00:12:49.520 --> 00:12:50.520]   I don't think that's that at all.
[00:12:50.520 --> 00:12:55.120]   I think it's just that if gold looks cool, if they built one and everyone in the room
[00:12:55.120 --> 00:12:56.120]   said, "Wow, that's cool.
[00:12:56.120 --> 00:12:57.120]   We want to make that.
[00:12:57.120 --> 00:12:59.120]   That is a definite Apple decision."
[00:12:59.120 --> 00:13:00.120]   All right.
[00:13:00.120 --> 00:13:02.800]   All of this is just color, just cosmetics.
[00:13:02.800 --> 00:13:06.440]   Let's get down to the nitty gritty, the nub of the matter, the fingerprint reader.
[00:13:06.440 --> 00:13:07.440]   Yes.
[00:13:07.440 --> 00:13:10.000]   Now you say now it's no longer an Audi, Renee Richie.
[00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:11.000]   It's an inny?
[00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:12.000]   It was never going to be.
[00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.920]   That was one part of the report.
[00:13:14.920 --> 00:13:18.480]   The last I heard a few months ago, they were like 80% of the way there.
[00:13:18.480 --> 00:13:22.160]   Mark Gurman had an excellent article up saying that the reason it didn't leak a lot was because
[00:13:22.160 --> 00:13:24.360]   it was being tested externally through a little cable.
[00:13:24.360 --> 00:13:29.360]   Now the gold iPhone prototype actually has it built into the device and they're testing
[00:13:29.360 --> 00:13:30.360]   it that way.
[00:13:30.360 --> 00:13:31.360]   It's not a swipe.
[00:13:31.360 --> 00:13:32.920]   It's not anything fancy.
[00:13:32.920 --> 00:13:34.880]   It's just your finger on the home button.
[00:13:34.880 --> 00:13:38.720]   It looks pretty much the way you expect a home button to look.
[00:13:38.720 --> 00:13:42.880]   My only question is how Apple balances their reliability because the more points you try
[00:13:42.880 --> 00:13:47.200]   to detect, the higher likelihood for error when someone's just trying to use it quickly
[00:13:47.200 --> 00:13:51.080]   or you have a lot of different kinds of people trying to use the phone.
[00:13:51.080 --> 00:13:54.720]   But apparently it's in the prototype and it looks like it's good for the pipeline.
[00:13:54.720 --> 00:13:58.120]   All right.
[00:13:58.120 --> 00:14:02.240]   Does Andy, you're the one who said that they were going to do this?
[00:14:02.240 --> 00:14:06.240]   I would never say that they will definitely do something or definitely not do something.
[00:14:06.240 --> 00:14:14.000]   Only that I think that that's a if I were to predict yes or predict no failing somebody
[00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:19.440]   really reliable having seen one box and ready to go, I would predict no only because it
[00:14:19.440 --> 00:14:24.720]   doesn't seem like a particularly elegant solution to a lot of problems.
[00:14:24.720 --> 00:14:30.480]   And the hardware that I've seen in the past and through the present doesn't have that
[00:14:30.480 --> 00:14:32.480]   sort of brainless tap it.
[00:14:32.480 --> 00:14:37.880]   It works reliability that I think Apple would want for something that's this important.
[00:14:37.880 --> 00:14:40.800]   But we don't know what context they're going to put this in.
[00:14:40.800 --> 00:14:43.760]   We don't know exactly what kind of hardware is in there yet.
[00:14:43.760 --> 00:14:50.480]   I mean, this is another horrible case of my putting in showing a phone that is not an
[00:14:50.480 --> 00:14:52.920]   iPhone, but Motorola has a clip.
[00:14:52.920 --> 00:14:53.920]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:14:53.920 --> 00:14:55.280]   It's not a clip.
[00:14:55.280 --> 00:14:59.720]   It's actually this is like a little tag that has NFC inside it and a little magnet.
[00:14:59.720 --> 00:15:00.720]   Exactly.
[00:15:00.720 --> 00:15:04.200]   So you can like clip this to like whatever pocket you're keeping you keeping the phone
[00:15:04.200 --> 00:15:08.960]   near or you can actually just attach it magnetically to the back of the phone.
[00:15:08.960 --> 00:15:10.760]   And so this is sort of the magical.
[00:15:10.760 --> 00:15:15.560]   Oh, well, if this is if this is in contact with this trust that you don't need to authenticate
[00:15:15.560 --> 00:15:19.040]   because it's so easy to remove or easy to brush against when you're taking it out of
[00:15:19.040 --> 00:15:20.040]   your pocket.
[00:15:20.040 --> 00:15:26.040]   And I've been I've had this since yesterday and it really is a nice simple little 10 $20
[00:15:26.040 --> 00:15:30.360]   elegant solution where when I'm in a when I'm in a situation like I'm in some inside
[00:15:30.360 --> 00:15:34.560]   the house where I trust myself that anybody's inside the house is going to be stealing things
[00:15:34.560 --> 00:15:36.880]   more important than stuff off my phone.
[00:15:36.880 --> 00:15:43.040]   I keep this attached when I leave the house this leaves behind and that's it works.
[00:15:43.040 --> 00:15:45.520]   It's simple and it's 100%.
[00:15:45.520 --> 00:15:51.480]   So as always when you see rumors about Apple stuff, you could you might be right guessing.
[00:15:51.480 --> 00:15:55.080]   You might be wrong guessing even if you're right in guessing that this piece of hardware
[00:15:55.080 --> 00:15:58.960]   is on the phone, you're probably not going to be able to correctly guess what context
[00:15:58.960 --> 00:15:59.960]   they're going to put it in.
[00:15:59.960 --> 00:16:02.920]   Remember that we had before Siri was released.
[00:16:02.920 --> 00:16:06.360]   There's a longstanding rumor that Apple was going to be doing a lot with with voice navigation
[00:16:06.360 --> 00:16:07.360]   and voice control.
[00:16:07.360 --> 00:16:11.800]   I don't think anybody really imagined that would be essentially an entire second app
[00:16:11.800 --> 00:16:19.440]   platform that has interactive conversations as opposed to simply iPhone schedule.
[00:16:19.440 --> 00:16:23.400]   May 23rd.
[00:16:23.400 --> 00:16:29.320]   As opposed to saying as opposed to be able to say highlight schedule meeting May 23rd.
[00:16:29.320 --> 00:16:30.840]   Yeah with Chris Breen.
[00:16:30.840 --> 00:16:32.960]   No that other Chris Breen.
[00:16:32.960 --> 00:16:36.520]   We would have known that they had voice they're going to do voice recognition but we would
[00:16:36.520 --> 00:16:37.760]   not have guessed Siri.
[00:16:37.760 --> 00:16:41.320]   So if they're going to do fingerprint authentication, we can guess that they're going to put that
[00:16:41.320 --> 00:16:42.600]   hardware in.
[00:16:42.600 --> 00:16:46.640]   We can make logical guesses as to what they'd use it for but I don't think we can predict
[00:16:46.640 --> 00:16:50.560]   what the demo that they would have planned on September 10th.
[00:16:50.560 --> 00:16:51.560]   Chris Breen.
[00:16:51.560 --> 00:16:55.840]   They did voice control on the iPhone 3GS long before they did Siri and that wasn't a great
[00:16:55.840 --> 00:16:56.840]   solution.
[00:16:56.840 --> 00:16:59.920]   So it doesn't mean they won't try something okay for now and then we'll get a magic version
[00:16:59.920 --> 00:17:00.920]   later.
[00:17:00.920 --> 00:17:04.960]   Chris Breen what do you think with a fingerprint reader?
[00:17:04.960 --> 00:17:07.840]   How does that change things for the iPhone?
[00:17:07.840 --> 00:17:11.400]   Well I think it's an interesting idea but I'm just looking at the technical challenges
[00:17:11.400 --> 00:17:12.400]   of it.
[00:17:12.400 --> 00:17:16.320]   First of all a lot of people use their phones when their fingers do not expose so if you're
[00:17:16.320 --> 00:17:20.280]   in Chicago in the middle of winter and you want to make a call, you can risk losing all
[00:17:20.280 --> 00:17:26.120]   your digits by taking your glove off and you can also try to get it.
[00:17:26.120 --> 00:17:27.640]   Oh okay well good.
[00:17:27.640 --> 00:17:28.640]   Maybe it isn't a thumbprint.
[00:17:28.640 --> 00:17:33.320]   They've always said that it's a very lickable design now they decided to actually take that
[00:17:33.320 --> 00:17:34.480]   to its logical extension.
[00:17:34.480 --> 00:17:36.600]   It's actually going to be on the back.
[00:17:36.600 --> 00:17:39.680]   So now you're walking around the world.
[00:17:39.680 --> 00:17:44.200]   Yeah so you're walking around the world like this until April.
[00:17:44.200 --> 00:17:46.000]   I get that back.
[00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:49.000]   That's how I get back to my time.
[00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:51.560]   I can't remember.
[00:17:51.560 --> 00:17:56.080]   And then there's also the issue of how many times do we use that button with different
[00:17:56.080 --> 00:17:58.080]   fingers and in different angles.
[00:17:58.080 --> 00:18:00.280]   Sometimes I use my second finger to touch this button.
[00:18:00.280 --> 00:18:02.640]   Sometimes I use the corner of my thumb with my left hand.
[00:18:02.640 --> 00:18:03.640]   Sometimes it's my right hand.
[00:18:03.640 --> 00:18:05.640]   So how many samples can I take and do this?
[00:18:05.640 --> 00:18:08.800]   But this is the company that said you're holding it wrong.
[00:18:08.800 --> 00:18:09.800]   Apparently there is.
[00:18:09.800 --> 00:18:13.560]   This is one way of enforcing that we all hold it just like that from now on.
[00:18:13.560 --> 00:18:17.760]   And I don't think in its first iteration I think my expectation is that it's something
[00:18:17.760 --> 00:18:19.240]   that is not required.
[00:18:19.240 --> 00:18:20.720]   It's something that just makes things easier.
[00:18:20.720 --> 00:18:21.720]   Right it's switch.
[00:18:21.720 --> 00:18:24.840]   So if I have a turn on like I still can, I bet you in the first iteration everything works
[00:18:24.840 --> 00:18:26.120]   exactly the same way.
[00:18:26.120 --> 00:18:29.720]   But if you put your thumb over it, it'll bypass the, you know, if you put your thumb
[00:18:29.720 --> 00:18:34.280]   correctly, it logs you in and that's all it does in the first round.
[00:18:34.280 --> 00:18:36.520]   Maybe they grow it past that once they see reliability.
[00:18:36.520 --> 00:18:40.960]   But I bet that's all they've added something to iOS seven.
[00:18:40.960 --> 00:18:43.560]   In fact, the new iOS seven beta supposed to come out today.
[00:18:43.560 --> 00:18:44.560]   Has it come out yet Renee?
[00:18:44.560 --> 00:18:45.560]   It's not.
[00:18:45.560 --> 00:18:46.560]   Any minute.
[00:18:46.560 --> 00:18:47.560]   It was supposed to come out yesterday.
[00:18:47.560 --> 00:18:48.560]   It was.
[00:18:48.560 --> 00:18:49.560]   Sorry.
[00:18:49.560 --> 00:18:51.960]   It wasn't everybody post the stories saying iOS beta is going to come out on Monday because
[00:18:51.960 --> 00:18:56.480]   they often do and then they can say told you so, but it is not a written rule.
[00:18:56.480 --> 00:18:57.480]   Okay.
[00:18:57.480 --> 00:18:58.480]   We did not post anything about an iOS seven.
[00:18:58.480 --> 00:19:00.280]   It'll come out after the shows over.
[00:19:00.280 --> 00:19:04.880]   But one of the things in iOS seven is this new feature, which really you could have included
[00:19:04.880 --> 00:19:06.080]   before, but it's great now.
[00:19:06.080 --> 00:19:10.840]   If you turn on the find my iPhone and you lose your iPhone, you could say it can't be
[00:19:10.840 --> 00:19:11.840]   this.
[00:19:11.840 --> 00:19:15.080]   I find my iPhone can't be disabled without a login adding that.
[00:19:15.080 --> 00:19:18.240]   And I think there's a reason why they put that in there going put that in the fingerprint.
[00:19:18.240 --> 00:19:20.520]   Now you really have a very secure phone.
[00:19:20.520 --> 00:19:22.280]   You don't ever have to worry about losing that phone.
[00:19:22.280 --> 00:19:26.680]   By the way, the clear clear your iPad or iPhone from it, you know, through find my iPhone
[00:19:26.680 --> 00:19:27.680]   works really well.
[00:19:27.680 --> 00:19:28.680]   Yeah.
[00:19:28.680 --> 00:19:30.320]   I had two that were going to happen.
[00:19:30.320 --> 00:19:32.760]   What happens is people get the iPhone.
[00:19:32.760 --> 00:19:34.360]   They turn it off immediately when they steal it.
[00:19:34.360 --> 00:19:35.360]   Right.
[00:19:35.360 --> 00:19:36.360]   First thing they do.
[00:19:36.360 --> 00:19:37.360]   Right.
[00:19:37.360 --> 00:19:41.120]   And then in a secure lead sealed room, they'll turn it on and disable it real quickly or
[00:19:41.120 --> 00:19:42.120]   something, you know.
[00:19:42.120 --> 00:19:46.800]   So the idea is that you can't disable it unless you have a fingerprint makes it makes it something
[00:19:46.800 --> 00:19:47.800]   that may be government.
[00:19:47.800 --> 00:19:50.320]   You know, remember the other thing that Apple has to be looking at is the fact that black
[00:19:50.320 --> 00:19:55.000]   Barry's imploding and that there's an opportunity if we can make a secure phone that government
[00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:56.000]   likes.
[00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:57.000]   Right.
[00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:59.900]   So what if the fingerprint reader doesn't do all I think you're on the right track,
[00:19:59.900 --> 00:20:03.320]   Andy, it doesn't do all or maybe it was Chris doesn't do all the things that we thought
[00:20:03.320 --> 00:20:04.320]   it would do.
[00:20:04.320 --> 00:20:06.200]   Maybe it just unlocks the phone.
[00:20:06.200 --> 00:20:07.680]   Maybe wall maybe passports later.
[00:20:07.680 --> 00:20:08.680]   Yeah.
[00:20:08.680 --> 00:20:09.680]   Like yeah.
[00:20:09.680 --> 00:20:13.720]   I mean, maybe just by itself be a pretty good thing.
[00:20:13.720 --> 00:20:17.800]   I would it would be worth it for me to just just so that I don't have to type in the code
[00:20:17.800 --> 00:20:21.560]   every time I want to get into it and if it worked 90% of the time, I'd be like, this
[00:20:21.560 --> 00:20:22.560]   is awesome.
[00:20:22.560 --> 00:20:26.120]   You know, and when my hands a little wet or whatever, maybe it doesn't work and but that's
[00:20:26.120 --> 00:20:27.120]   fine.
[00:20:27.120 --> 00:20:31.760]   But I think that that's and that also allows them to I mean, it's still a big push forward
[00:20:31.760 --> 00:20:35.720]   and then it allows them to figure out whether it's really working because the bottom line
[00:20:35.720 --> 00:20:37.600]   is to get to get any of this stuff working.
[00:20:37.600 --> 00:20:38.600]   You need a high sample rate.
[00:20:38.600 --> 00:20:42.240]   So you need a million, you know, having two million people just logging in is going to
[00:20:42.240 --> 00:20:45.840]   give you an awful lot of data about what's working and not working about the about the
[00:20:45.840 --> 00:20:46.840]   process.
[00:20:46.840 --> 00:20:51.800]   And look at other new features like Safari, the iCloud key chain sync, which is going
[00:20:51.800 --> 00:20:55.080]   to be an OS 10 Mavericks and in the iPhone, it's still not clear to me how that's going
[00:20:55.080 --> 00:20:58.320]   to be implemented because I know one pass would I have a master password.
[00:20:58.320 --> 00:21:02.040]   But once I open my iPhone, once I open my Mac, if there's no barrier between just like
[00:21:02.040 --> 00:21:05.640]   someone walking up to the machine and typing something in, that's less secure for me.
[00:21:05.640 --> 00:21:07.080]   That's not something I'm going to use.
[00:21:07.080 --> 00:21:11.800]   But if it's if Safari key chain sync can be triggered by the thumb scan as well, that
[00:21:11.800 --> 00:21:14.320]   kind of stuff starts to be and maybe that won't be the first version, you know, like
[00:21:14.320 --> 00:21:17.200]   Alex said, maybe that'll be iOS 8.
[00:21:17.200 --> 00:21:21.320]   But there seems like there's a lot of features Apple could implement sort of like with Passbook.
[00:21:21.320 --> 00:21:22.880]   There's no NFC now.
[00:21:22.880 --> 00:21:23.960]   There's no commercial.
[00:21:23.960 --> 00:21:27.000]   There's no actual cash exchange now.
[00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:30.120]   But once you get all these technologies, you know, two or three years out, they start
[00:21:30.120 --> 00:21:33.000]   to make a very cohesive thing together.
[00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:35.560]   I think that's one of Apple's for Tays.
[00:21:35.560 --> 00:21:41.120]   I just I just hope that all the central thing is that you put your thumb over this thing
[00:21:41.120 --> 00:21:44.720]   and it reads that's or you put the finger of your choice over this thing and it reads
[00:21:44.720 --> 00:21:46.800]   your your fingerprint correctly.
[00:21:46.800 --> 00:21:51.200]   If they get that in a tiny tiny little phone, that will be a breakthrough thing.
[00:21:51.200 --> 00:21:52.200]   Yeah.
[00:21:52.200 --> 00:21:56.160]   If it's gold and it has a thumbprint reader, I want it.
[00:21:56.160 --> 00:21:58.360]   You're getting the gold one, aren't you, Leo?
[00:21:58.360 --> 00:22:00.120]   Of course I'm getting the gold one.
[00:22:00.120 --> 00:22:01.120]   Me too.
[00:22:01.120 --> 00:22:05.040]   After, you know, after all my patrician will, that's just tasteless.
[00:22:05.040 --> 00:22:06.040]   Yeah.
[00:22:06.040 --> 00:22:07.040]   Can't wait.
[00:22:07.040 --> 00:22:11.600]   And I want a tiny giraffe.
[00:22:11.600 --> 00:22:14.920]   Thurston gets the gold.
[00:22:14.920 --> 00:22:19.240]   If it works, but of course, as we observe many times, Apple really doesn't do technologies
[00:22:19.240 --> 00:22:21.960]   that don't work, right?
[00:22:21.960 --> 00:22:23.440]   Yeah.
[00:22:23.440 --> 00:22:24.440]   Are you on launch day?
[00:22:24.440 --> 00:22:25.440]   Zero maps.
[00:22:25.440 --> 00:22:26.440]   Yeah.
[00:22:26.440 --> 00:22:27.440]   Mobile me.
[00:22:27.440 --> 00:22:33.480]   I mean, but the thing is that it's interesting to bring up because has that's they learned
[00:22:33.480 --> 00:22:36.120]   that maps was incredibly embarrassing.
[00:22:36.120 --> 00:22:40.840]   They would not have planned it that way, but it's not as though it killed the company
[00:22:40.840 --> 00:22:43.000]   to have a product that didn't work quite so well.
[00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:47.040]   And in the process of putting out a product that didn't work quite so well, they learned
[00:22:47.040 --> 00:22:49.440]   more about how to make it better.
[00:22:49.440 --> 00:22:54.240]   Maybe I don't I don't think this would embolden them to use a fingerprint, for example, a
[00:22:54.240 --> 00:22:57.440]   fingerprint scanner that they knew wasn't 100%.
[00:22:57.440 --> 00:23:02.520]   But at least one argument in the room would be we're really, really we've tested it as
[00:23:02.520 --> 00:23:03.760]   much as we possibly can.
[00:23:03.760 --> 00:23:07.320]   Our fear that we haven't tested it enough should not prevent us from putting in what
[00:23:07.320 --> 00:23:12.600]   we think is going to be a very, very wonderful feature because again, we hear as how much
[00:23:12.600 --> 00:23:13.840]   money we're sitting on right now.
[00:23:13.840 --> 00:23:18.960]   We can as long as it doesn't destroy the company for more than 18 consecutive months,
[00:23:18.960 --> 00:23:22.120]   this is worth this is worth going ahead with.
[00:23:22.120 --> 00:23:25.160]   And one thing one thing was in the chat room is someone was talking about, you know, it'll
[00:23:25.160 --> 00:23:28.880]   be collecting your fingerprints, but really these aren't really reading your fingerprints.
[00:23:28.880 --> 00:23:34.320]   They're collecting a hash of key markers that oftentimes only make sense to the software
[00:23:34.320 --> 00:23:35.760]   that's actually using it.
[00:23:35.760 --> 00:23:37.520]   They can't do you know, it's not like sport.
[00:23:37.520 --> 00:23:41.440]   It's not like the NSA is going to pull all your fingerprints from all these phones and
[00:23:41.440 --> 00:23:42.600]   everything else.
[00:23:42.600 --> 00:23:47.720]   So kudos to Mike Elgin who posited six months ago that this would happen and said, and
[00:23:47.720 --> 00:23:53.680]   I think he was right on that this could be huge because if your phone becomes your identity
[00:23:53.680 --> 00:23:57.640]   device and as a reliable device for proving identity, there's all sorts of useful things.
[00:23:57.640 --> 00:23:58.640]   It's huge.
[00:23:58.640 --> 00:23:59.640]   It's huge.
[00:23:59.640 --> 00:24:00.640]   It's huge.
[00:24:00.640 --> 00:24:02.640]   For instance, one would hope they'd build in strong encryption into the email.
[00:24:02.640 --> 00:24:06.440]   I think it's an opportunity to go right after the government and corporate business that
[00:24:06.440 --> 00:24:09.360]   BlackBerry is apparently leaving behind.
[00:24:09.360 --> 00:24:15.280]   In fact, really the iPhone I imagine is the number one, bring your own device in corporate
[00:24:15.280 --> 00:24:18.880]   and government would love to do that too if they weren't prohibited from doing that.
[00:24:18.880 --> 00:24:22.360]   And if Apple could make a credible case there that have a real opportunity.
[00:24:22.360 --> 00:24:26.400]   I mean, I think we are moving especially I think this is going to help push this forward
[00:24:26.400 --> 00:24:30.840]   with phones is that we aren't that far away from a total kind of born identity thing where
[00:24:30.840 --> 00:24:33.880]   you hold the phone up, you put your thumb on the bottom, you look at you have it do an
[00:24:33.880 --> 00:24:40.040]   iris scan, you give it a vocal scan and you type a code in and if you're a high level
[00:24:40.040 --> 00:24:45.160]   government or corporate employee, that would be very useful.
[00:24:45.160 --> 00:24:49.480]   So okay, I mean, we've kind of done a 180 here.
[00:24:49.480 --> 00:24:50.560]   You guys have been telling me for months.
[00:24:50.560 --> 00:24:51.560]   I think I happened.
[00:24:51.560 --> 00:24:52.560]   But I did not do a 180.
[00:24:52.560 --> 00:24:57.640]   I do like it.
[00:24:57.640 --> 00:25:01.680]   And again, I just I didn't say would never happen just saying that here are the problems
[00:25:01.680 --> 00:25:02.920]   they'd have to solve this.
[00:25:02.920 --> 00:25:04.520]   Apparently they've solved it.
[00:25:04.520 --> 00:25:06.320]   Well, no, we'll see.
[00:25:06.320 --> 00:25:07.320]   We'll see.
[00:25:07.320 --> 00:25:08.320]   Yeah.
[00:25:08.320 --> 00:25:14.120]   I mean, I'm just saying it would be a shame if they spent 20, 30 minutes explaining this
[00:25:14.120 --> 00:25:18.000]   during during the September 10th event and showing off how well it works.
[00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:21.520]   And then it gets into people's hands and it's becomes one of those Samsung style features
[00:25:21.520 --> 00:25:25.800]   where they play with it out of the box, then they disable it because it's not working
[00:25:25.800 --> 00:25:26.800]   right.
[00:25:26.800 --> 00:25:29.480]   And then even when they fix it two or three weeks or months later, they never turn it
[00:25:29.480 --> 00:25:32.480]   back on again because they completely forgotten that this feature exists.
[00:25:32.480 --> 00:25:36.720]   So that would it would be a shame if it was so limited of such limited use and of such
[00:25:36.720 --> 00:25:40.920]   limited reliability that people just simply dismiss it as soon as they get their third
[00:25:40.920 --> 00:25:42.360]   or fourth failure with it.
[00:25:42.360 --> 00:25:46.320]   Well, it's going to the problem of Siri is that people are constantly yelling into their
[00:25:46.320 --> 00:25:49.360]   phone saying, do this, do this, do this, and it doesn't do it.
[00:25:49.360 --> 00:25:53.320]   And so if you're constantly tapping on this thing instead and it's not registering it,
[00:25:53.320 --> 00:25:55.760]   then you switch it off and you're done.
[00:25:55.760 --> 00:25:56.760]   Yeah.
[00:25:56.760 --> 00:25:59.280]   Chris, would it add appreciably to the cost of the phone though, won't it?
[00:25:59.280 --> 00:26:04.440]   I mean, that's not an insignificant thing to put in a fingerprint reader or is it cheap?
[00:26:04.440 --> 00:26:07.920]   You know, I honestly don't know what the technology costs, but considering that they
[00:26:07.920 --> 00:26:13.560]   would be selling a jillion of these phones, I think they could stand to offer it.
[00:26:13.560 --> 00:26:15.920]   Look at the cost to a stock price markup.
[00:26:15.920 --> 00:26:16.920]   Yeah.
[00:26:16.920 --> 00:26:21.320]   And because, you know, clearly they're going to sell a lot of these things and they already
[00:26:21.320 --> 00:26:24.000]   make a fair amount of money on these things.
[00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:28.200]   So if it, if they really are feeling the pressure from Samsung and Android, it may be that they're
[00:26:28.200 --> 00:26:32.000]   willing to take a little bit less profit on this, pump this up.
[00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:37.000]   If it really is working as well as they believe it is and hope that they gain a significant
[00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:38.000]   advantage.
[00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:42.400]   And a lot of it is because of what exactly you're talking about having to take the place
[00:26:42.400 --> 00:26:48.640]   of the government stuffs, take over the security corner and claim that as their own.
[00:26:48.640 --> 00:26:49.640]   Samsung's going after this.
[00:26:49.640 --> 00:26:52.320]   Plus, that makes it, you know, everybody wants that business.
[00:26:52.320 --> 00:26:53.480]   Yeah, but right.
[00:26:53.480 --> 00:26:56.480]   But I think it's for a lot of people, they still have to, they're still convincing their
[00:26:56.480 --> 00:27:01.160]   IT departments that this is a safe phone and they've, they're resistant because it's not
[00:27:01.160 --> 00:27:03.520]   Android or it's not Windows.
[00:27:03.520 --> 00:27:06.480]   And that once and more, that's, you know, one more check in the column where they can
[00:27:06.480 --> 00:27:11.320]   say, look, it not only does that, but it's doing X, Y and Z because of iOS 7 and the fingerprint
[00:27:11.320 --> 00:27:12.320]   detection.
[00:27:12.320 --> 00:27:17.320]   So I think it would be okay for them to not try to reap a huge profit on this technology.
[00:27:17.320 --> 00:27:19.240]   Well, just think of it, just think of the negotiations.
[00:27:19.240 --> 00:27:20.240]   How much would that cost?
[00:27:20.240 --> 00:27:22.600]   And how much it would have cost if I bought a million?
[00:27:22.600 --> 00:27:23.600]   Right.
[00:27:23.600 --> 00:27:24.600]   80 million.
[00:27:24.600 --> 00:27:28.440]   That's the old West Wing joke where they said, you know, the second one cost a dollar.
[00:27:28.440 --> 00:27:30.320]   The first one cost a billion dollars.
[00:27:30.320 --> 00:27:31.320]   Right.
[00:27:31.320 --> 00:27:34.520]   And Apple has shown that they're not at, I mean, the iPhone 5, they redesigned that
[00:27:34.520 --> 00:27:38.640]   entire phone, which was hugely expensive, costs a fortune to manufacture, relatively
[00:27:38.640 --> 00:27:42.480]   speaking, and they did it for, you know, very, no one would have cared if they hadn't redesigned
[00:27:42.480 --> 00:27:44.440]   the entire phone from the atom up.
[00:27:44.440 --> 00:27:47.880]   They're not adverse to spending large amounts of money and reducing what could, I mean,
[00:27:47.880 --> 00:27:51.160]   they could still be making the iPhone 3GS version four if they wanted to save money on
[00:27:51.160 --> 00:27:52.160]   manufacturing.
[00:27:52.160 --> 00:27:56.720]   I think also, I mean, Apple wants to do things that are difficult and expensive to do because
[00:27:56.720 --> 00:28:00.960]   that is, you know, that's a key limiter to their competition.
[00:28:00.960 --> 00:28:05.000]   Well, that, and that's the, that's the other thing is since Apple owns authentic, I would
[00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:09.560]   imagine, there'll be stuff in here, because I mean, really in a normal world, Samsung
[00:28:09.560 --> 00:28:12.120]   will put this in their next phone, right?
[00:28:12.120 --> 00:28:15.360]   And last, Apple has key technologies that make it work right.
[00:28:15.360 --> 00:28:19.840]   I think tech has been, we've seen that before has not been very impressive on Lenovo, but
[00:28:19.840 --> 00:28:20.840]   yeah.
[00:28:20.840 --> 00:28:24.320]   Well, yeah, I mean, that, so this could be a key differentiator.
[00:28:24.320 --> 00:28:28.160]   If it works, works great and it's used widely by merchants and so forth.
[00:28:28.160 --> 00:28:29.960]   And Samsung can't copy it.
[00:28:29.960 --> 00:28:31.880]   Well, they'll do it anyway.
[00:28:31.880 --> 00:28:32.880]   It just may not be.
[00:28:32.880 --> 00:28:33.880]   We'll see how it was.
[00:28:33.880 --> 00:28:34.880]   It was S voice.
[00:28:34.880 --> 00:28:35.880]   I think a few months after Siri.
[00:28:35.880 --> 00:28:38.840]   So I'm sure they'll, as long as the checkboxes, there are a lot of companies are happy to
[00:28:38.840 --> 00:28:39.840]   just check it off.
[00:28:39.840 --> 00:28:40.840]   Yeah.
[00:28:40.840 --> 00:28:44.000]   Well, and I guess everybody has pointed out time and time again, everything we've seen
[00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:47.080]   up to now with fingerprint readers and I've used them on Lenovo, the atrix and a variety
[00:28:47.080 --> 00:28:48.080]   of other devices.
[00:28:48.080 --> 00:28:53.800]   They're unpredictable, unreliable, easy to, easy to dupe according to the Mythbusters.
[00:28:53.800 --> 00:28:57.160]   Although every time people say, but the Mythbusters prove that I have to point out,
[00:28:57.160 --> 00:29:01.600]   let's say TV show, not a scientific study.
[00:29:01.600 --> 00:29:05.600]   But you know, and these readers do look for things like infrared heat and, you know, I
[00:29:05.600 --> 00:29:07.160]   mean, it's there.
[00:29:07.160 --> 00:29:09.640]   I think they're harder to spoof than one might imagine.
[00:29:09.640 --> 00:29:12.000]   When they read it a lot over the last couple years.
[00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:13.000]   Yeah.
[00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:18.240]   It's also you're saying that my future finger harvesting businesses probably sunk finger
[00:29:18.240 --> 00:29:24.800]   on a stick or at or the next time someone invites you to, hi, Chris, why don't you here's
[00:29:24.800 --> 00:29:26.600]   a brand new glass of water.
[00:29:26.600 --> 00:29:30.120]   Why don't you just have a nice spot on that and I'll take that back for you now.
[00:29:30.120 --> 00:29:31.120]   Thank you.
[00:29:31.120 --> 00:29:32.120]   Thanks for sure.
[00:29:32.120 --> 00:29:36.040]   That lawyers at Samsung right now are looking over as many patents as they can.
[00:29:36.040 --> 00:29:38.960]   We've got to have one in here somewhere and it's got to be one somewhere.
[00:29:38.960 --> 00:29:41.600]   All right, we're going to take a break.
[00:29:41.600 --> 00:29:45.200]   Anything well, before we do, I mean, we might as well finish the iPhone discussion.
[00:29:45.200 --> 00:29:48.220]   Anything else you know, Renee, Richie, Goldphone, fingerprint reader, it's an in-nanny nanny
[00:29:48.220 --> 00:29:50.240]   nanny or is it flat, you know?
[00:29:50.240 --> 00:29:51.240]   It's still in.
[00:29:51.240 --> 00:29:52.240]   I believe it's still in my current.
[00:29:52.240 --> 00:29:53.240]   It's in any.
[00:29:53.240 --> 00:29:55.240]   It's in any and it doesn't look that different.
[00:29:55.240 --> 00:29:57.560]   It probably wouldn't look different at all.
[00:29:57.560 --> 00:30:00.800]   That's great because it's just a feature that just kind of is there magically.
[00:30:00.800 --> 00:30:01.800]   Right.
[00:30:01.800 --> 00:30:02.800]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:30:02.800 --> 00:30:03.800]   Yeah.
[00:30:03.800 --> 00:30:05.520]   Anything else we know that we want to know, it's going to be the same frame, right?
[00:30:05.520 --> 00:30:08.120]   Everybody agrees you don't, on an S.
[00:30:08.120 --> 00:30:12.880]   You're going to have a more advanced processor, not exactly, not necessarily faster, but more
[00:30:12.880 --> 00:30:17.480]   advanced, like a better image processor or probably be a Swift 2 core, which is, you know,
[00:30:17.480 --> 00:30:19.560]   the first generation Swift was Apple's first.
[00:30:19.560 --> 00:30:21.320]   They made their own chip.
[00:30:21.320 --> 00:30:26.280]   It'll probably have, well, hopefully it'll have the new rogue GPU in it because, you know,
[00:30:26.280 --> 00:30:29.480]   they're still constrained by how many pixels they can throw around.
[00:30:29.480 --> 00:30:34.760]   It should be, except for the gold, internally, it should be a fantastic update.
[00:30:34.760 --> 00:30:35.760]   Good.
[00:30:35.760 --> 00:30:37.760]   And iOS 7.
[00:30:37.760 --> 00:30:38.760]   All right.
[00:30:38.760 --> 00:30:39.760]   Yeah.
[00:30:39.760 --> 00:30:43.480]   And iOS 7 with a gold boot screen, hopefully to go along with that goal.
[00:30:43.480 --> 00:30:44.480]   Oh.
[00:30:44.480 --> 00:30:46.240]   Well, all right.
[00:30:46.240 --> 00:30:47.480]   I guess we're done.
[00:30:47.480 --> 00:30:48.480]   We'll find out.
[00:30:48.480 --> 00:30:53.200]   Usually, typically, we don't see invitations till a week before, which means September 3rd.
[00:30:53.200 --> 00:30:54.200]   Everybody's agreed though.
[00:30:54.200 --> 00:30:58.240]   It seems like there's a, we're, we're converging on consensus, not only that it's September
[00:30:58.240 --> 00:31:03.720]   10th, but that there will be gold and that there will be a fingerprint reader.
[00:31:03.720 --> 00:31:04.720]   You know what I'm going to do?
[00:31:04.720 --> 00:31:08.760]   Because I'm going to be on the, on vacation, I'm taping radio shows at a time.
[00:31:08.760 --> 00:31:12.560]   I'm going to do a recording like right before the event for the radio show, which I'm going
[00:31:12.560 --> 00:31:18.520]   to say, you're hearing this after the iPhone event, but I'm recording it before the iPhone
[00:31:18.520 --> 00:31:19.520]   event.
[00:31:19.520 --> 00:31:22.080]   And here's what we think is going to happen and see how close we can get.
[00:31:22.080 --> 00:31:23.080]   I think it's great.
[00:31:23.080 --> 00:31:24.080]   Play the little bingo game.
[00:31:24.080 --> 00:31:25.080]   Yeah.
[00:31:25.080 --> 00:31:26.080]   Yeah.
[00:31:26.080 --> 00:31:27.080]   And I think that's a great thing.
[00:31:27.080 --> 00:31:28.080]   I think that's a great thing.
[00:31:28.080 --> 00:31:29.080]   I think that's a great thing.
[00:31:29.080 --> 00:31:30.080]   I think that's a great thing.
[00:31:30.080 --> 00:31:31.080]   I think that's a great thing.
[00:31:31.080 --> 00:31:32.080]   I think that's a great thing.
[00:31:32.080 --> 00:31:33.080]   I think that's a great thing.
[00:31:33.080 --> 00:31:34.080]   I think that's a great thing.
[00:31:34.080 --> 00:31:35.080]   I think that's a great thing.
[00:31:35.080 --> 00:31:36.080]   I think that's a great thing.
[00:31:36.080 --> 00:31:37.080]   I think that's a great thing.
[00:31:37.080 --> 00:31:38.080]   I think that's a great thing.
[00:31:38.080 --> 00:31:39.080]   I think that's a great thing.
[00:31:39.080 --> 00:31:40.080]   I think that's a great thing.
[00:31:40.080 --> 00:31:41.080]   I think that's a great thing.
[00:31:41.080 --> 00:31:42.080]   I think that's a great thing.

[00:32:50.080 --> 00:32:51.080]   I think that's a great thing.
[00:32:51.080 --> 00:32:52.080]   I think that's a great thing.

[00:32:59.080 --> 00:33:04.080]   Let's talk about Audible.com, the audiobook source.
[00:33:04.080 --> 00:33:05.080]   They have a new count.
[00:33:05.080 --> 00:33:06.080]   We have a new count.
[00:33:06.080 --> 00:33:08.080]   150,000 titles at Audible.com.
[00:33:08.080 --> 00:33:10.080]   It's going to take a long time to get through all those.
[00:33:10.080 --> 00:33:11.080]   It's growing fast.
[00:33:11.080 --> 00:33:17.080]   I own five or six hundred because I've been a member since the year 2013 years now.
[00:33:17.080 --> 00:33:24.080]   One of the nice things about the Audible app on the iPhone, the iPad, Android, Windows
[00:33:24.080 --> 00:33:28.080]   Phone, Metro, yeah, I think there's even a Blackbird one is you could see your whole library.
[00:33:28.080 --> 00:33:32.080]   Everything you've ever purchased on Audible and download and relisten to anything.
[00:33:32.080 --> 00:33:33.080]   It's great.
[00:33:33.080 --> 00:33:34.080]   It really is like a bookstore for you.
[00:33:34.080 --> 00:33:35.080]   Science fiction fiction.
[00:33:35.080 --> 00:33:40.080]   We're going to let Andy do his pick, but I do want to mention one of my favorite authors
[00:33:40.080 --> 00:33:43.080]   of all time passed away today, Elmore Leonard, 87 years old.
[00:33:43.080 --> 00:33:45.080]   They call him the Dickens of Detroit.
[00:33:45.080 --> 00:33:52.080]   He wrote the best stories about dumb crooks ever.
[00:33:52.080 --> 00:33:57.080]   You've seen many movies based on his stuff like Get Shorty, but all of his books and there
[00:33:57.080 --> 00:34:02.080]   are literally dozens are available.
[00:34:02.080 --> 00:34:05.080]   He wrote Westerns to three tendiumas, one of his.
[00:34:05.080 --> 00:34:08.080]   Jackie Brown is one of his the justified TV series.
[00:34:08.080 --> 00:34:12.080]   He wrote the pilot for and was a story editor for.
[00:34:12.080 --> 00:34:15.080]   There's just something about Elmore Leonard's style.
[00:34:15.080 --> 00:34:16.080]   He's the greatest.
[00:34:16.080 --> 00:34:17.080]   Have you read any of these?
[00:34:17.080 --> 00:34:18.080]   I haven't read it.
[00:34:18.080 --> 00:34:19.080]   I'm like justified a lot.
[00:34:19.080 --> 00:34:23.080]   Oh, well, everything you like about justified is Elmore Leonard.
[00:34:23.080 --> 00:34:26.080]   The dumb crooks, the kind of the weirdo dumb crooks.
[00:34:26.080 --> 00:34:28.080]   That's Elmore Leonard right there.
[00:34:28.080 --> 00:34:31.080]   It's highly recommend any of his stuff.
[00:34:31.080 --> 00:34:36.080]   They have on the front page, they have Pronto, which I think is his most recent novel.
[00:34:36.080 --> 00:34:40.080]   He was writing right up to the very end.
[00:34:40.080 --> 00:34:47.080]   I interviewed him maybe 20 years ago and just a huge, huge fan.
[00:34:47.080 --> 00:34:48.080]   So that would be one thing.
[00:34:48.080 --> 00:34:50.080]   Now, what we're going to do is we're going to get you a free book.
[00:34:50.080 --> 00:34:53.080]   So maybe you're not a fan of these kind of books.
[00:34:53.080 --> 00:34:55.080]   Audible.com/MacBreak.
[00:34:55.080 --> 00:34:56.080]   Go there.
[00:34:56.080 --> 00:34:58.080]   You'll be signing up for the gold account.
[00:34:58.080 --> 00:34:59.080]   You're not stuck with that.
[00:34:59.080 --> 00:35:05.080]   There's dozens of 150,000 dozens, 100,000 dozens of other books there.
[00:35:05.080 --> 00:35:07.080]   What are you reading these days, Andy?
[00:35:07.080 --> 00:35:11.080]   Actually, I have the same thought that you did after hearing the news this morning.
[00:35:11.080 --> 00:35:14.080]   And so I was going to pick Gold Coast.
[00:35:14.080 --> 00:35:15.080]   Oh, I love that one.
[00:35:15.080 --> 00:35:17.080]   Which is I love it.
[00:35:17.080 --> 00:35:22.080]   Yeah, I mean, it reminds me of like all these great movies from the 40s that are on the
[00:35:22.080 --> 00:35:28.080]   corner, classic movies because the premise is mob boss dies, leaves incredible wealth
[00:35:28.080 --> 00:35:33.080]   to his widow with the proviso that she never gets involved with another man.
[00:35:33.080 --> 00:35:35.080]   And then another man comes along.
[00:35:35.080 --> 00:35:41.080]   What's the mob enforcer who's set behind to watch after the widow going to be talking
[00:35:41.080 --> 00:35:42.080]   about this?
[00:35:42.080 --> 00:35:45.080]   And it's like, oh, who would I cast in this movie?
[00:35:45.080 --> 00:35:49.080]   So on a bridge, like six or seven hours, that's good or good.
[00:35:49.080 --> 00:35:51.080]   And it's kind of page turning stuff.
[00:35:51.080 --> 00:35:55.080]   If you need, if you have a plane flight or a long drive and you just want to have it go
[00:35:55.080 --> 00:36:00.280]   by painlessly, nothing like Elmo letter, the justified series is based on his "Rail and
[00:36:00.280 --> 00:36:01.280]   Givens" series.
[00:36:01.280 --> 00:36:05.080]   And there are several books in that series, at least three I see here.
[00:36:05.080 --> 00:36:07.080]   The first one is "Pronto."
[00:36:07.080 --> 00:36:10.080]   That's the one that they were talking about.
[00:36:10.080 --> 00:36:11.080]   Freaky deaky.
[00:36:11.080 --> 00:36:13.080]   Oh, so out of sight.
[00:36:13.080 --> 00:36:15.080]   Somebody had been made into movies bandits.
[00:36:15.080 --> 00:36:17.080]   Out of sight was a...
[00:36:17.080 --> 00:36:19.080]   That, you know, now I didn't realize that he wrote that.
[00:36:19.080 --> 00:36:20.080]   Yeah.
[00:36:20.080 --> 00:36:23.080]   I mean, out of sight, the movie was definitely classic.
[00:36:23.080 --> 00:36:24.080]   He's second.
[00:36:24.080 --> 00:36:25.080]   Stupid cop.
[00:36:25.080 --> 00:36:26.080]   Yeah.
[00:36:26.080 --> 00:36:27.080]   Stupid cop.
[00:36:27.080 --> 00:36:28.080]   Stupid criminals and...
[00:36:28.080 --> 00:36:29.080]   Yeah, Mr. Paradise.
[00:36:29.080 --> 00:36:33.080]   He's second only a Philip K. Dick and the number of novel books that have been made out of,
[00:36:33.080 --> 00:36:35.080]   I mean, movies that have been made out of as movies.
[00:36:35.080 --> 00:36:36.080]   He's just amazing.
[00:36:36.080 --> 00:36:37.080]   Cat Chaser.
[00:36:37.080 --> 00:36:38.080]   Cuba Libre.
[00:36:38.080 --> 00:36:39.080]   Anyway.
[00:36:39.080 --> 00:36:44.720]   And I think it is because of that, because almost all of his books that I've read, you
[00:36:44.720 --> 00:36:47.080]   could really summarize them in exactly one paragraph.
[00:36:47.080 --> 00:36:51.080]   And no one won't get the entire book, but you can easily say what's it about?
[00:36:51.080 --> 00:36:55.080]   It's about, well, mob boss dies, leaves wealth to his widow.
[00:36:55.080 --> 00:36:56.080]   And what...
[00:36:56.080 --> 00:36:57.080]   And it's...
[00:36:57.080 --> 00:36:58.080]   And hi, Jinks and Sue.
[00:36:58.080 --> 00:36:59.080]   Yeah.
[00:36:59.080 --> 00:37:02.080]   It's not like these other books, like, you know, where...
[00:37:02.080 --> 00:37:04.080]   Okay, well, there's a spaceship that's coming.
[00:37:04.080 --> 00:37:06.080]   Like Arthur C. Clark's like middle...
[00:37:06.080 --> 00:37:07.080]   Middle books.
[00:37:07.080 --> 00:37:08.080]   It's like...
[00:37:08.080 --> 00:37:12.080]   It's a spaceship, but it's not a spaceship so much as it is an echo of a spaceship.
[00:37:12.080 --> 00:37:13.080]   Oh, so it's about the spaceship.
[00:37:13.080 --> 00:37:16.080]   No, it's about this astronaut who...
[00:37:16.080 --> 00:37:18.080]   And he goes to the spaceship and he's one...
[00:37:18.080 --> 00:37:20.080]   Hey, is that a spaceship?
[00:37:20.080 --> 00:37:24.080]   But then on the way to the spaceship, he encounters an energy field.
[00:37:24.080 --> 00:37:25.080]   So he explores the energy field.
[00:37:25.080 --> 00:37:27.080]   This is not an EMBOL.
[00:37:27.080 --> 00:37:28.080]   Obviously.
[00:37:28.080 --> 00:37:32.080]   Like Mr. Majestic, the great Charles Bronson movie, a Charles...
[00:37:32.080 --> 00:37:34.080]   A, a, a, a, Elmore Leonard novel.
[00:37:34.080 --> 00:37:37.080]   Gosh, I can go on and on.
[00:37:37.080 --> 00:37:38.080]   Great stuff.
[00:37:38.080 --> 00:37:40.080]   They have 38 Elmore Leonard novels on here.
[00:37:40.080 --> 00:37:41.080]   Pick one.
[00:37:41.080 --> 00:37:42.080]   It's yours free.
[00:37:42.080 --> 00:37:45.080]   Audible.com/Macbreak.
[00:37:45.080 --> 00:37:52.080]   What you need is an Elmore Leonard book that is then turned to a screenplay by David Mammon.
[00:37:52.080 --> 00:37:53.080]   Ah!
[00:37:53.080 --> 00:37:54.080]   Like that would be...
[00:37:54.080 --> 00:37:55.080]   Ooh!
[00:37:55.080 --> 00:37:57.080]   I feel like I just want to...
[00:37:57.080 --> 00:38:02.080]   I'm going to read them all one by one because, you know, he's one of my favorite authors of all time.
[00:38:02.080 --> 00:38:04.080]   And I just...
[00:38:04.080 --> 00:38:06.080]   And I was sad to see he died, but he's 87.
[00:38:06.080 --> 00:38:08.080]   He's not like he can live a rich full life.
[00:38:08.080 --> 00:38:14.080]   And those who are into Justify don't have to feel that any of his books are reruns.
[00:38:14.080 --> 00:38:16.080]   Of the Justified stuff.
[00:38:16.080 --> 00:38:19.080]   The original Justified pilot came from a short story.
[00:38:19.080 --> 00:38:20.080]   Right.
[00:38:20.080 --> 00:38:24.080]   In which, in which case, Boyd Crowder actually dies instead of lives on.
[00:38:24.080 --> 00:38:28.080]   But the other, given his novels are, have not been repeated in the series.
[00:38:28.080 --> 00:38:29.080]   Oh, that's good.
[00:38:29.080 --> 00:38:31.080]   So you'll get rich material with them.
[00:38:31.080 --> 00:38:32.080]   Yeah.
[00:38:32.080 --> 00:38:33.080]   Again, I love the guy too.
[00:38:33.080 --> 00:38:35.080]   I think I've read everything he's written.
[00:38:35.080 --> 00:38:36.080]   Have you?
[00:38:36.080 --> 00:38:39.080]   And his use of dialogue in particular is so spot on.
[00:38:39.080 --> 00:38:43.080]   It's very sparse, but so natural sounding.
[00:38:43.080 --> 00:38:45.080]   So sorry to see him go.
[00:38:45.080 --> 00:38:51.080]   You know, there's another author, like him Carl Hyacin, who specialized in dumb cooks from Florida.
[00:38:51.080 --> 00:38:54.080]   But I just love that stuff.
[00:38:54.080 --> 00:38:55.080]   I don't know why.
[00:38:55.080 --> 00:38:57.080]   And Elmore Leonard is the king of it all.
[00:38:57.080 --> 00:38:58.080]   And I haven't read his westerns.
[00:38:58.080 --> 00:39:03.080]   I have to go back and read those because that would be awesome.
[00:39:03.080 --> 00:39:06.080]   So I don't know why you can't see my screen.
[00:39:06.080 --> 00:39:09.080]   We were doing it so well before.
[00:39:09.080 --> 00:39:11.080]   Chad, I don't know.
[00:39:11.080 --> 00:39:14.080]   I'm plugged in.
[00:39:14.080 --> 00:39:15.080]   Maybe there's some button.
[00:39:15.080 --> 00:39:16.080]   You know what happened?
[00:39:16.080 --> 00:39:17.080]   Oh, I know what happened.
[00:39:17.080 --> 00:39:19.080]   Let's try this.
[00:39:19.080 --> 00:39:21.080]   Chad, we need to get you to talk back.
[00:39:21.080 --> 00:39:23.080]   Why can't you talk to me?
[00:39:23.080 --> 00:39:25.080]   Just say, I can interrupt the show.
[00:39:25.080 --> 00:39:26.080]   Oh, he's being nice.
[00:39:26.080 --> 00:39:28.080]   He doesn't want to interrupt the show.
[00:39:28.080 --> 00:39:29.080]   You know what happened?
[00:39:29.080 --> 00:39:33.080]   The Linux, just as you posited and I denied, did launch.
[00:39:33.080 --> 00:39:35.080]   And suddenly I was in the Linux.
[00:39:35.080 --> 00:39:40.080]   I'm trying to, the Google Chromebook Pixel today is my, uh, cause I mean, I'm not.
[00:39:40.080 --> 00:39:41.080]   We can go back to the Mac.
[00:39:41.080 --> 00:39:42.080]   You're right.
[00:39:42.080 --> 00:39:43.080]   I'm not seeing you either.
[00:39:43.080 --> 00:39:44.080]   So I don't know what happened.
[00:39:44.080 --> 00:39:45.080]   Maybe this one.
[00:39:45.080 --> 00:39:46.080]   I'm punishing you.
[00:39:46.080 --> 00:39:48.080]   Yeah, they don't like it when I use Chromebook.
[00:39:48.080 --> 00:39:52.080]   But okay, to make you feel better, the reason I want to use it is because I can't, it's
[00:39:52.080 --> 00:39:53.080]   really, it's nothing you can do with it.
[00:39:53.080 --> 00:39:54.080]   You're trying to get your Mac home.
[00:39:54.080 --> 00:39:56.080]   Yeah, I want to take my Mac home.
[00:39:56.080 --> 00:39:58.080]   I want to use it.
[00:39:58.080 --> 00:40:01.080]   Uh, okay, moving on.
[00:40:01.080 --> 00:40:04.080]   What did I say we were going to talk about when we came back?
[00:40:04.080 --> 00:40:05.080]   I don't even remember now.
[00:40:05.080 --> 00:40:07.080]   Maybe I said it to myself in my head.
[00:40:07.080 --> 00:40:08.080]   I think it was in your head.
[00:40:08.080 --> 00:40:12.080]   Apple acquires matcha.tv.
[00:40:12.080 --> 00:40:15.520]   It is a recommendation engine.
[00:40:15.520 --> 00:40:20.080]   Are we going to see ping for video soon?
[00:40:20.080 --> 00:40:23.720]   Uh, things dead man.
[00:40:23.720 --> 00:40:24.720]   Ping's dead man.
[00:40:24.720 --> 00:40:28.520]   It's a second screen TV video app matcha.tv.
[00:40:28.520 --> 00:40:29.520]   I don't know.
[00:40:29.520 --> 00:40:30.520]   Did anybody try this on iOS?
[00:40:30.520 --> 00:40:31.520]   I don't, I never tried it.
[00:40:31.520 --> 00:40:36.040]   It gave you everything that you could watch via all your providers.
[00:40:36.040 --> 00:40:40.040]   That was the theory and then you can manage it from a universal cue, get recommendations,
[00:40:40.040 --> 00:40:41.400]   connect with social networks.
[00:40:41.400 --> 00:40:43.000]   It really was ping.
[00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:46.280]   Shut down in May.
[00:40:46.280 --> 00:40:50.440]   And the CEO told TechCrunch, we're not gone for good.
[00:40:50.440 --> 00:40:52.000]   We're working on a new direction.
[00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:54.760]   Certainly the new direction led them straight to Cupertino.
[00:40:54.760 --> 00:40:55.760]   That's a good direction.
[00:40:55.760 --> 00:40:59.160]   If you're going to try to buy a direction, that's not a bad, not a bad direction.
[00:40:59.160 --> 00:41:03.600]   Apple's response to a venture beats article about this was.
[00:41:03.600 --> 00:41:09.240]   We occasionally acquire smaller technology companies from time to time and we generally
[00:41:09.240 --> 00:41:11.880]   do not discuss our purpose or plans.
[00:41:11.880 --> 00:41:15.080]   That's got to be a text expander, snippet on Dowings keyboard now.
[00:41:15.080 --> 00:41:20.960]   Now you have, why do you have a, you know, you know what the code is in Tech's Fair.
[00:41:20.960 --> 00:41:21.960]   F you.
[00:41:21.960 --> 00:41:25.120]   You just type that in and then it puts, it just throws it in.
[00:41:25.120 --> 00:41:28.680]   But you think about Siri, we took a moment like a year to incorporate Siri after they
[00:41:28.680 --> 00:41:29.680]   acquired it, right?
[00:41:29.680 --> 00:41:30.680]   These things could take time.
[00:41:30.680 --> 00:41:31.680]   Chomp took a while to.
[00:41:31.680 --> 00:41:32.680]   Chomp.
[00:41:32.680 --> 00:41:34.640]   Did Dave really incorporate Chomp?
[00:41:34.640 --> 00:41:37.120]   Has it been incorporated into the app, into the app store store?
[00:41:37.120 --> 00:41:38.760]   Yeah, it's a puzzle.
[00:41:38.760 --> 00:41:44.600]   There is such a massive second screen, you know, there's so many opportunities in second
[00:41:44.600 --> 00:41:48.200]   screen that I'm kind of amazed it's taken this long and I still think that points to
[00:41:48.200 --> 00:41:49.720]   an Apple TV somewhere down the road.
[00:41:49.720 --> 00:41:52.440]   Not, it doesn't even, it doesn't have to be a TV.
[00:41:52.440 --> 00:41:54.160]   Even just integrated with Apple TV.
[00:41:54.160 --> 00:41:59.880]   I should also point out that in Silicon Valley, this is pretty much SOP because there's so
[00:41:59.880 --> 00:42:04.800]   little engineering talent to go around that when you find a company with smart guys,
[00:42:04.800 --> 00:42:08.960]   sometimes the easiest way to get the guys or gals is to buy the company.
[00:42:08.960 --> 00:42:09.960]   How long did it cost you to go in?
[00:42:09.960 --> 00:42:11.600]   Many, many, many times already.
[00:42:11.600 --> 00:42:12.600]   Yeah.
[00:42:12.600 --> 00:42:17.240]   I think of Sam Lesson, who I really adore, who did a really great little app called Drop.io.
[00:42:17.240 --> 00:42:19.960]   Remember that we would use that to transfer files.
[00:42:19.960 --> 00:42:24.360]   Facebook acquired Drop.io, shut it down, but Sam Lesson had to do it.
[00:42:24.360 --> 00:42:25.800]   What he went on to do was timeline.
[00:42:25.800 --> 00:42:26.800]   Right.
[00:42:26.800 --> 00:42:28.400]   So it's very, very common in Silicon Valley.
[00:42:28.400 --> 00:42:32.320]   So I don't think you can necessarily assume that when you see an acquisition like this,
[00:42:32.320 --> 00:42:35.320]   that these guys are going to do matcha for Apple.
[00:42:35.320 --> 00:42:36.480]   They just, they're good engineers.
[00:42:36.480 --> 00:42:37.560]   They write mobile apps.
[00:42:37.560 --> 00:42:39.240]   That's what Apple needs, right?
[00:42:39.240 --> 00:42:41.920]   Search and recommendation is such a holy grail in that entire industry.
[00:42:41.920 --> 00:42:44.920]   I mean, if you look at any of the stuff that John Syracuse has written about omnivorous
[00:42:44.920 --> 00:42:49.560]   boxes and the idea of being able, right now on the Apple TV, you can't search across
[00:42:49.560 --> 00:42:50.560]   the Apple TV.
[00:42:50.560 --> 00:42:54.680]   You have to go into each little silo like Netflix or iTunes and search for stuff.
[00:42:54.680 --> 00:42:56.560]   And that's only the content that's physically on the box.
[00:42:56.560 --> 00:43:00.880]   It doesn't include any content on devices like an Xbox One, which will also do HDMI
[00:43:00.880 --> 00:43:03.800]   pass through or Google TV's approach to searching.
[00:43:03.800 --> 00:43:05.720]   And if you can provide better, I forget what it was.
[00:43:05.720 --> 00:43:09.640]   But wasn't Netflix paying a million dollar bounty for just incremental increase on their
[00:43:09.640 --> 00:43:10.640]   recommendation quality?
[00:43:10.640 --> 00:43:12.240]   So I mean, it's definitely a technology.
[00:43:12.240 --> 00:43:15.400]   Someone who wants to be an entertainment like Apple should be looking at.
[00:43:15.400 --> 00:43:18.880]   And, you know, I think part of the reason that they haven't had like a way to search
[00:43:18.880 --> 00:43:19.880]   across the things.
[00:43:19.880 --> 00:43:20.880]   So you don't do things like I do.
[00:43:20.880 --> 00:43:24.520]   Like we're buying Apple, buy something on Apple TV and then we're going through Netflix
[00:43:24.520 --> 00:43:26.000]   to watch another Breaking Bad.
[00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:29.120]   And then I realized the movie I just bought is on Netflix.
[00:43:29.120 --> 00:43:31.200]   Where are we talking about that the last week though?
[00:43:31.200 --> 00:43:34.120]   How nice it would be to have cross-platform search.
[00:43:34.120 --> 00:43:35.120]   Yeah.
[00:43:35.120 --> 00:43:36.880]   I found out what went wrong.
[00:43:36.880 --> 00:43:38.440]   Cable got pulled out.
[00:43:38.440 --> 00:43:41.960]   The key is always just finding out you want to start a Netflix so that you know that you
[00:43:41.960 --> 00:43:45.000]   don't, they don't have to watch ads on Hulu or buy it from Apple.
[00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:49.160]   And then you move to Hulu if you're willing to put up with the ads.
[00:43:49.160 --> 00:43:51.120]   Yeah, or Amazon Prime.
[00:43:51.120 --> 00:43:52.720]   Sometimes that's free too, right?
[00:43:52.720 --> 00:43:53.720]   So you got to do all that.
[00:43:53.720 --> 00:43:55.840]   Well, do you guys use, can you stream it?
[00:43:55.840 --> 00:43:56.840]   No.
[00:43:56.840 --> 00:43:58.000]   You know the, can you stream it website?
[00:43:58.000 --> 00:43:59.000]   Can you stream it?
[00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:00.000]   Oh, it's awesome.
[00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:04.320]   Can letter you stream it and it will tell you among the major services what you can stream,
[00:44:04.320 --> 00:44:06.760]   put in a show or the movie you want to see.
[00:44:06.760 --> 00:44:08.920]   And it will tell you who's offering it for free.
[00:44:08.920 --> 00:44:11.880]   So if you want Netflix, great, it'll tell you.
[00:44:11.880 --> 00:44:12.880]   Can I stream it?
[00:44:12.880 --> 00:44:13.880]   I can't use it.
[00:44:13.880 --> 00:44:14.880]   I can't.
[00:44:14.880 --> 00:44:15.880]   I can't.
[00:44:15.880 --> 00:44:16.880]   I stream it.
[00:44:16.880 --> 00:44:17.880]   Right.
[00:44:17.880 --> 00:44:18.880]   That's cool.
[00:44:18.880 --> 00:44:19.880]   Well, that's why you hadn't heard of it.
[00:44:19.880 --> 00:44:20.880]   Yes.
[00:44:20.880 --> 00:44:24.160]   But, but, and there's apps, right?
[00:44:24.160 --> 00:44:25.160]   So that's cool.
[00:44:25.160 --> 00:44:26.160]   Yeah.
[00:44:26.160 --> 00:44:27.160]   So you can get it on an app as well.
[00:44:27.160 --> 00:44:30.840]   And then this way you can see if it's, or you can edit or you can purchase it.
[00:44:30.840 --> 00:44:34.240]   And then if it's offered by six different outfits, you can decide, well, you know, I
[00:44:34.240 --> 00:44:35.760]   get a better Netflix signal.
[00:44:35.760 --> 00:44:40.320]   So I'll use that instead of having to rent it from Apple, for example.
[00:44:40.320 --> 00:44:42.920]   What's interesting is Apple's doing early access now.
[00:44:42.920 --> 00:44:46.760]   Some movies that are not so, you know, not blockbusters, but are still in theaters.
[00:44:46.760 --> 00:44:47.800]   You can get early access to.
[00:44:47.800 --> 00:44:51.040]   And I think Star Trek Into Darkness today went up on iTunes.
[00:44:51.040 --> 00:44:53.040]   You can buy it before you can buy it in other mediums.
[00:44:53.040 --> 00:44:56.320]   And that's probably how they're competing with endless streams by exclusivity.
[00:44:56.320 --> 00:44:58.000]   I see that though.
[00:44:58.000 --> 00:44:59.000]   And it really is annoying.
[00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:02.960]   I see that on all the guys that you can buy at Amazon does this too, where it's $20.
[00:45:02.960 --> 00:45:04.240]   You can't rent it yet.
[00:45:04.240 --> 00:45:08.720]   And now they finally said you'll be able to rent it, you know, September 8th or whatever.
[00:45:08.720 --> 00:45:09.720]   Right.
[00:45:09.720 --> 00:45:10.720]   I find that very frustrating.
[00:45:10.720 --> 00:45:11.720]   That used to happen with DVDs.
[00:45:11.720 --> 00:45:14.480]   You go to, like you build a buy it, you can go to the DVD store and rent it.
[00:45:14.480 --> 00:45:17.200]   I think that's the studio is trying to maximize the profit they make from the disc.
[00:45:17.200 --> 00:45:18.200]   Oh, yeah.
[00:45:18.200 --> 00:45:19.200]   Before they even go to the lore.
[00:45:19.200 --> 00:45:20.200]   Yeah.
[00:45:20.200 --> 00:45:21.200]   And I don't think it's just Apple that's doing this.
[00:45:21.200 --> 00:45:22.200]   Hey, here's the new iCloud.
[00:45:22.200 --> 00:45:23.200]   Get ready.
[00:45:23.200 --> 00:45:25.000]   iOSification of everything.
[00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:29.000]   The new iCloud beta is iOS seven.
[00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:32.720]   Oh, so Apple's really going all out on this one.
[00:45:32.720 --> 00:45:33.880]   Are we surprised?
[00:45:33.880 --> 00:45:34.880]   I guess.
[00:45:34.880 --> 00:45:35.880]   Tilt your keyboard, Leo.
[00:45:35.880 --> 00:45:36.880]   I want to see if it's parallax.
[00:45:36.880 --> 00:45:37.880]   Yeah, it doesn't do the parallax.
[00:45:37.880 --> 00:45:39.720]   I'm trying.
[00:45:39.720 --> 00:45:42.400]   I'm trying.
[00:45:42.400 --> 00:45:46.000]   So I guess this is where we're headed on the.
[00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:51.600]   Do you think I always 10 will get this candy, candy color look?
[00:45:51.600 --> 00:45:52.600]   I hope not.
[00:45:52.600 --> 00:45:53.600]   No comment.
[00:45:53.600 --> 00:45:54.600]   I hope not.
[00:45:54.600 --> 00:45:56.600]   Yeah, not this year.
[00:45:56.600 --> 00:46:00.520]   I think iCloud is by definition a mobile sort of product.
[00:46:00.520 --> 00:46:02.640]   So that's why I would get that kind of treatment.
[00:46:02.640 --> 00:46:03.640]   Okay.
[00:46:03.640 --> 00:46:04.640]   All right.
[00:46:04.640 --> 00:46:05.840]   I do like iCloud.
[00:46:05.840 --> 00:46:10.640]   And this is yeah, they have redesigned the looks like the whole thing.
[00:46:10.640 --> 00:46:11.640]   Yeah.
[00:46:11.640 --> 00:46:12.640]   Yeah.
[00:46:12.640 --> 00:46:14.640]   It's kind of an interesting.
[00:46:14.640 --> 00:46:17.440]   Go ahead.
[00:46:17.440 --> 00:46:20.480]   It's kind of an interesting thing given that there are like Chromebooks that are actually
[00:46:20.480 --> 00:46:23.080]   very good that cost $200.
[00:46:23.080 --> 00:46:28.400]   This could be and given how well iCloud documents syncing works across devices, not that not
[00:46:28.400 --> 00:46:32.600]   that in any way a Chromebook would be a replacement for a MacBook error or an iPad.
[00:46:32.600 --> 00:46:36.040]   But I think that there are some people who have that kind of I just need.
[00:46:36.040 --> 00:46:39.840]   I work when I'm outside of the office or outside of the house that could now think, but why
[00:46:39.840 --> 00:46:44.920]   don't I just use this device that I really, really like when I try using an iPad and a
[00:46:44.920 --> 00:46:45.920]   keyboard?
[00:46:45.920 --> 00:46:46.920]   Why don't I try using a.
[00:46:46.920 --> 00:46:47.920]   Okay.
[00:46:47.920 --> 00:46:52.620]   I'm not an iPad, you'll be able to use I work anyway, but it opens up iCloud and I work
[00:46:52.620 --> 00:46:54.840]   apps to a whole other category devices.
[00:46:54.840 --> 00:46:56.640]   Well, I mean, this is a Chromebook.
[00:46:56.640 --> 00:46:57.640]   This is the pixel.
[00:46:57.640 --> 00:47:03.600]   It does say your browser isn't fully supported because it's Chrome obviously, but nevertheless,
[00:47:03.600 --> 00:47:06.320]   if it's not fully supported, I don't know what's missing because it sure looks a lot
[00:47:06.320 --> 00:47:08.400]   like pages.
[00:47:08.400 --> 00:47:09.680]   And you're exactly right.
[00:47:09.680 --> 00:47:12.680]   I mean, and frankly, this is what they're trying.
[00:47:12.680 --> 00:47:14.800]   They have to compete with Google Docs, right?
[00:47:14.800 --> 00:47:17.720]   I mean, that's that's that's got to be important.
[00:47:17.720 --> 00:47:24.320]   So and office 365 and people talk about how horrible Apple's cross platform stuff is and
[00:47:24.320 --> 00:47:28.280]   you know, iTunes on Windows is not a great app and being able to do Web App.
[00:47:28.280 --> 00:47:31.640]   Like trying to make I work for Windows would be horrible, but making a Web App that you
[00:47:31.640 --> 00:47:35.720]   could there at the open on any browser enabled device is a much better solution.
[00:47:35.720 --> 00:47:36.720]   Yeah, that kind of stuff.
[00:47:36.720 --> 00:47:40.960]   And the big and the big deal is that it adds credibility for I work and iCloud.
[00:47:40.960 --> 00:47:45.120]   If if you're trying to essential right now, the argument that Apple would have to make
[00:47:45.120 --> 00:47:49.240]   is that I work is you should absolutely you should definitely be using I work in iCloud
[00:47:49.240 --> 00:47:50.720]   in your school or business.
[00:47:50.720 --> 00:47:54.240]   Of course, we're going to require you to replace every computer you have right now with an
[00:47:54.240 --> 00:47:56.400]   Apple product because it's only works on Apple products.
[00:47:56.400 --> 00:47:58.320]   But other than that, you're going to be so much happier with it.
[00:47:58.320 --> 00:48:00.320]   You spend tens of thousands, like that.
[00:48:00.320 --> 00:48:05.760]   This way they can they can allow 40% of the school to be running Macs and allow the other
[00:48:05.760 --> 00:48:09.280]   60% to still live inside that ecosystem.
[00:48:09.280 --> 00:48:12.920]   It's a really good first step and credit to them for even though I'm not a supported
[00:48:12.920 --> 00:48:16.640]   browser launching and sometimes that you know, I see stuff where it says, well, we're just
[00:48:16.640 --> 00:48:17.840]   not going to start up for you.
[00:48:17.840 --> 00:48:18.840]   Google does that sometimes.
[00:48:18.840 --> 00:48:20.200]   I opened it on a Blackberry 10.
[00:48:20.200 --> 00:48:23.280]   I mean, they're never going to make I work for a Blackberry 10.
[00:48:23.280 --> 00:48:24.280]   Right.
[00:48:24.280 --> 00:48:26.520]   And my whole thing though is that until we can get multiple people logging into the same
[00:48:26.520 --> 00:48:31.600]   thing for us, I know we just are very heavy users of Google Apps and collaboration.
[00:48:31.600 --> 00:48:32.600]   Yeah.
[00:48:32.600 --> 00:48:38.040]   Being able to have multiple people opening up the the the documents is without that.
[00:48:38.040 --> 00:48:39.040]   It doesn't show up.
[00:48:39.040 --> 00:48:41.240]   I mean, I was just saved the way we're saving it now.
[00:48:41.240 --> 00:48:42.240]   Right.
[00:48:42.240 --> 00:48:45.160]   You know, there's a lot of people that have single use their single users and they and
[00:48:45.160 --> 00:48:46.560]   having it available everywhere is great.
[00:48:46.560 --> 00:48:50.360]   And so I'm glad that Apple's going that direction, but I think that they need to add the ability
[00:48:50.360 --> 00:48:51.600]   for people to collaborate.
[00:48:51.600 --> 00:48:56.360]   But but that but else like you're you're not a typical user like you're you're buying
[00:48:56.360 --> 00:48:58.280]   like through Mac pros and like double packs.
[00:48:58.280 --> 00:49:01.800]   You can wear them like the rocketeer wherever you go.
[00:49:01.800 --> 00:49:06.960]   But I think this is for a good for a Google apps user.
[00:49:06.960 --> 00:49:11.920]   The idea of having right now all of us in the show or at least all of us in the studio
[00:49:11.920 --> 00:49:14.400]   right here are all in a Google apps.
[00:49:14.400 --> 00:49:16.560]   Well, that's because that's how we work.
[00:49:16.560 --> 00:49:18.280]   I mean, but but that's why a lot of people work.
[00:49:18.280 --> 00:49:21.280]   I'm just saying that the thing is is that we couldn't even do it in pages if we wanted
[00:49:21.280 --> 00:49:22.280]   to.
[00:49:22.280 --> 00:49:23.280]   Exactly.
[00:49:23.280 --> 00:49:24.960]   That's the thing is is that and we're all sitting there and adding things and pulling
[00:49:24.960 --> 00:49:28.320]   things out and writing notes and all of us are editing the same thing.
[00:49:28.320 --> 00:49:33.400]   And that is what Apple, you know, needs to they need to figure out how to do this.
[00:49:33.400 --> 00:49:34.400]   Right.
[00:49:34.400 --> 00:49:37.720]   But again, I don't think that that's or at least for the first version of this, I don't
[00:49:37.720 --> 00:49:39.800]   think that the collaboration is what they're really aiming for.
[00:49:39.800 --> 00:49:44.160]   I really do think it is about let's get more installations of I work.
[00:49:44.160 --> 00:49:47.240]   Let's get more people counting on iCloud and we can't do that.
[00:49:47.240 --> 00:49:52.600]   If we're if we make this a 100% Apple only pool party, I think it's a way to extend that
[00:49:52.600 --> 00:49:55.000]   to other notebooks, other devices, other platforms.
[00:49:55.000 --> 00:49:56.000]   I think it is.
[00:49:56.000 --> 00:49:59.800]   And I think that collaboration is one of Apple's, you know, weak points.
[00:49:59.800 --> 00:50:00.800]   Time for our time.
[00:50:00.800 --> 00:50:01.800]   Just put in there too.
[00:50:01.800 --> 00:50:06.920]   It'd be fantastic at some point, Apple time for our regular I watch update.
[00:50:06.920 --> 00:50:08.480]   We can now confirm that J Blonick.
[00:50:08.480 --> 00:50:11.080]   He speculated J Blonick had moved to Apple.
[00:50:11.080 --> 00:50:15.720]   He shut down his fitness business, stopped speaking, even referred to it at some of his
[00:50:15.720 --> 00:50:16.720]   speeches.
[00:50:16.720 --> 00:50:19.040]   And now he has in fact tweeted at this.
[00:50:19.040 --> 00:50:20.720]   Now we all learn everything nowadays.
[00:50:20.720 --> 00:50:22.080]   And it's the new press release.
[00:50:22.080 --> 00:50:26.360]   He says, somebody tweets him saying, so pardon me.
[00:50:26.360 --> 00:50:31.400]   While I stick my thumb on my mouth, take to bed and weep to sad Kelly Clarkson sounds.
[00:50:31.400 --> 00:50:32.400]   J Blonick responds.
[00:50:32.400 --> 00:50:33.400]   Yes, it is true.
[00:50:33.400 --> 00:50:36.960]   A wonderful and exciting opportunity.
[00:50:36.960 --> 00:50:37.960]   Everybody.
[00:50:37.960 --> 00:50:40.880]   And I don't know the name J Blonick because I'm not a fit person.
[00:50:40.880 --> 00:50:44.920]   But apparently everybody who knows J Blonick, he works in the Nike fuel band.
[00:50:44.920 --> 00:50:48.640]   He is apparently the most inspirational speaker in this category.
[00:50:48.640 --> 00:50:52.080]   He's worked for Gatorade, General Electric.
[00:50:52.080 --> 00:50:56.560]   He has consulted apparently at Apple before, but now he's shut everything down to focus
[00:50:56.560 --> 00:50:59.480]   full time on something at Apple.
[00:50:59.480 --> 00:51:02.480]   I'm only going to say is it someone like that shows everything down.
[00:51:02.480 --> 00:51:03.480]   I'll just check.
[00:51:03.480 --> 00:51:04.480]   Yeah.
[00:51:04.480 --> 00:51:05.480]   Money.
[00:51:05.480 --> 00:51:08.280]   He's working on I work in the cloud.
[00:51:08.280 --> 00:51:09.280]   Yeah, sure.
[00:51:09.280 --> 00:51:10.280]   Yeah, that's it.
[00:51:10.280 --> 00:51:11.280]   I see.
[00:51:11.280 --> 00:51:12.280]   You're jogging and collaborating.
[00:51:12.280 --> 00:51:14.280]   Maybe that's it.
[00:51:14.280 --> 00:51:16.280]   Tim just said, would you come work for me?
[00:51:16.280 --> 00:51:17.280]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:51:17.280 --> 00:51:18.880]   I'm feeling a little flabby.
[00:51:18.880 --> 00:51:20.280]   I need to do something here.
[00:51:20.280 --> 00:51:22.960]   And you still like the guy that would do that for me.
[00:51:22.960 --> 00:51:25.360]   I think he I think he used like inspiration for his mentor.
[00:51:25.360 --> 00:51:30.000]   He just had that long walk with him and said, do you want to teach fat kids to exercise
[00:51:30.000 --> 00:51:34.560]   to become healthy or do you want to help me change the world?
[00:51:34.560 --> 00:51:38.840]   Speaking of which, we're going to talk about jobs, the movie and just a little bit.
[00:51:38.840 --> 00:51:39.920]   A few of us have seen it.
[00:51:39.920 --> 00:51:41.360]   Two of us haven't.
[00:51:41.360 --> 00:51:43.400]   We will give you our capsule review.
[00:51:43.400 --> 00:51:46.640]   That scene does in fact make it into the movie.
[00:51:46.640 --> 00:51:52.960]   John Scully tells the story in the movie about jobs saying you want to make sugar water.
[00:51:52.960 --> 00:51:55.840]   For the rest of your life, you want to change the world.
[00:51:55.840 --> 00:51:58.120]   And then he turned him like a viper.
[00:51:58.120 --> 00:51:59.120]   But that's another story.
[00:51:59.120 --> 00:52:01.240]   We're talking about squarespace.com right now.
[00:52:01.240 --> 00:52:05.080]   The secret behind everybody's great website, maybe yours.
[00:52:05.080 --> 00:52:10.280]   If you haven't found out about squarespace, the best hosting, the best content management

[00:52:57.120 --> 00:53:00.320]   Photographers love this because the pictures go right to the edges.
[00:53:00.320 --> 00:53:01.880]   By the way, notice it's mobile responsive.

[00:53:40.000 --> 00:53:45.760]   all squarespace and you end up having a bunch of stuff that's WYSIWYG that, you know, someone
[00:53:45.760 --> 00:53:50.000]   without any coding experience can edit parts of the site and then you have sites where you
[00:53:50.000 --> 00:53:53.120]   decided to inject code and certainly can do that.
[00:53:53.120 --> 00:53:55.960]   And that having that all be able to be mixed and matched is just--
[00:53:55.960 --> 00:53:57.440]   I guess the point is you don't have to.
[00:53:57.440 --> 00:53:58.440]   You don't have to.
[00:53:58.440 --> 00:53:59.440]   You can get--
[00:53:59.440 --> 00:54:02.840]   Most of these sites, great sites without any of that and that's really what's so cool
[00:54:02.840 --> 00:54:07.240]   about squarespace.
[00:54:07.240 --> 00:54:08.760]   We're still looking for people to tweet us.
[00:54:08.760 --> 00:54:14.680]   I don't see any URLs in here from the past, so let's collect some more squarespace sites.
[00:54:14.680 --> 00:54:18.080]   We want to kind of plug people who are using squarespace, show you what people are doing.
[00:54:18.080 --> 00:54:23.760]   So tweet, you know, all you need to do is put the hashtag #MacBreakSquarespace at it all
[00:54:23.760 --> 00:54:25.400]   one word and we'll take a look.
[00:54:25.400 --> 00:54:28.200]   And I promise you next week we'll have some sites.
[00:54:28.200 --> 00:54:33.520]   #MacBreakSquarespace and we can highlight your squarespace site, show people what you're
[00:54:33.520 --> 00:54:34.520]   doing.
[00:54:34.520 --> 00:54:38.320]   Really is amazing when I see all the things people are doing with squarespace.
[00:54:38.320 --> 00:54:39.800]   Here's how you can try it right now.
[00:54:39.800 --> 00:54:42.960]   As I said, you don't need a credit card or anything to try it free for two weeks.
[00:54:42.960 --> 00:54:47.440]   In fact, if you're just doing a special one-off site for an event or a wedding or planning
[00:54:47.440 --> 00:54:48.600]   something, go ahead.
[00:54:48.600 --> 00:54:49.600]   Be our guest.
[00:54:49.600 --> 00:54:50.600]   Use it.
[00:54:50.600 --> 00:54:51.600]   They're happy to do that.
[00:54:51.600 --> 00:54:54.000]   Oh, they've added stories now.
[00:54:54.000 --> 00:54:55.000]   This is cool.
[00:54:55.000 --> 00:54:57.040]   So you can see people's squarespace stories.
[00:54:57.040 --> 00:54:58.640]   That's cool.
[00:54:58.640 --> 00:55:00.840]   Take a tour of squarespace.
[00:55:00.840 --> 00:55:03.560]   But eventually I want you to go to the pricing menu.
[00:55:03.560 --> 00:55:06.640]   That's what Chad was just showing you.
[00:55:06.640 --> 00:55:08.240]   Unbelievable, the deal.
[00:55:08.240 --> 00:55:10.560]   So these are all when you buy an annual plan.
[00:55:10.560 --> 00:55:11.560]   You can get it month to month if you want.
[00:55:11.560 --> 00:55:17.120]   You can remember when you look at that price, it's hosting and all of this.
[00:55:17.120 --> 00:55:22.640]   And when you get in the business plan, that's e-commerce too, unlimited digital or physical
[00:55:22.640 --> 00:55:25.160]   items, no transaction fees.
[00:55:25.160 --> 00:55:28.080]   They will build a mobile store for you because it's automatic.
[00:55:28.080 --> 00:55:33.480]   You get inventory tracking, tax calculations, shipping calculations, you even got coup-brun
[00:55:33.480 --> 00:55:34.480]   cajos.
[00:55:34.480 --> 00:55:38.720]   All of this for 24 bucks a month, flat fee.
[00:55:38.720 --> 00:55:41.960]   And I got to point out both the unlimited and business plans have unlimited pages, unlimited
[00:55:41.960 --> 00:55:43.920]   galleries, unlimited blogs, unlimited bandwidth.
[00:55:43.920 --> 00:55:45.600]   You never get a bandwidth bill.
[00:55:45.600 --> 00:55:47.680]   Unlimited storage, unlimited contributors.
[00:55:47.680 --> 00:55:48.680]   There's no hosting like this.
[00:55:48.680 --> 00:55:50.160]   Trust me, I know.
[00:55:50.160 --> 00:55:51.160]   You're going to love it.
[00:55:51.160 --> 00:55:52.160]   Squarespace.com.
[00:55:52.160 --> 00:55:57.240]   Do me one little favor after you try it if you decide to buy, use Macbreak 8.
[00:55:57.240 --> 00:56:00.080]   Macbreak and the number 8 is your offer code so that we get credit for that.
[00:56:00.080 --> 00:56:05.160]   And you'll get something in return 10% off your first purchase with new accounts.
[00:56:05.160 --> 00:56:06.680]   That's why the yearly plan is good.
[00:56:06.680 --> 00:56:10.160]   Oh, also the other reason for yearly is they give you, you can register a free domain name
[00:56:10.160 --> 00:56:11.800]   and they'll hook it all up for you.
[00:56:11.800 --> 00:56:13.840]   So if you, this is, here's the way to try it.
[00:56:13.840 --> 00:56:14.840]   I got a great idea.
[00:56:14.840 --> 00:56:16.720]   I want to try something, great idea for a site.
[00:56:16.720 --> 00:56:20.160]   You go in there, you do the get started two weeks, feels good to you.
[00:56:20.160 --> 00:56:22.640]   Then you sign up, use Macbreak 8 as the offer code.
[00:56:22.640 --> 00:56:23.640]   You'll save 10%.
[00:56:23.640 --> 00:56:24.640]   You get the domain registry.
[00:56:24.640 --> 00:56:30.160]   I mean, this is, this is the way a month from now you'll be rolling in dough.
[00:56:30.160 --> 00:56:33.560]   You'll have a miniature giraffe in gold.
[00:56:33.560 --> 00:56:34.560]   Billence.
[00:56:34.560 --> 00:56:35.560]   I has it.
[00:56:35.560 --> 00:56:36.560]   Oh, Billence.
[00:56:36.560 --> 00:56:37.560]   I has it.
[00:56:37.560 --> 00:56:38.560]   I love that ad.
[00:56:38.560 --> 00:56:39.560]   I forgot about that.
[00:56:39.560 --> 00:56:43.160]   That's all I can think about when I saw, when I saw the gold iPhone, that's all I can
[00:56:43.160 --> 00:56:44.160]   think about.
[00:56:44.160 --> 00:56:47.400]   You were all at the movie theater the other day seeing jobs, but I didn't see, that would
[00:56:47.400 --> 00:56:49.960]   have been the perfect place to put that Mac Pro ad.
[00:56:49.960 --> 00:56:52.200]   Has anybody seen the Mac Pro ad yet?
[00:56:52.200 --> 00:56:53.200]   Yes.
[00:56:53.200 --> 00:56:54.200]   No.
[00:56:54.200 --> 00:56:55.200]   It's cool.
[00:56:55.200 --> 00:56:56.200]   You saw the ad in the theater?
[00:56:56.200 --> 00:56:57.200]   I did.
[00:56:57.200 --> 00:56:58.200]   It was, it was here at the, at the panel.
[00:56:58.200 --> 00:56:59.200]   Really?
[00:56:59.200 --> 00:57:00.200]   Yeah, it was before Despicable Me Too.
[00:57:00.200 --> 00:57:02.200]   And I watched it.
[00:57:02.200 --> 00:57:06.280]   I was like, I don't know if this is the right age group, but for that, but it's, hey,
[00:57:06.280 --> 00:57:07.280]   Jill, awesome.
[00:57:07.280 --> 00:57:08.880]   Got $5,000 to spend.
[00:57:08.880 --> 00:57:11.720]   We've got the Mac for you.
[00:57:11.720 --> 00:57:14.000]   So what did, so it says coming this fall, right?
[00:57:14.000 --> 00:57:15.000]   That's good news.
[00:57:15.000 --> 00:57:16.000]   I was disappointed.
[00:57:16.000 --> 00:57:17.000]   I wanted to say coming in September.
[00:57:17.000 --> 00:57:19.200]   Well, it'll be, I was the right answer.
[00:57:19.200 --> 00:57:25.200]   I think, I think another prediction we safely make September 10th iPhones, right?
[00:57:25.200 --> 00:57:28.560]   October X new iPads.
[00:57:28.560 --> 00:57:30.800]   We're definitely going to see an iPad five, right?
[00:57:30.800 --> 00:57:32.640]   Probably going to maybe see a new retina mini.
[00:57:32.640 --> 00:57:33.640]   I don't know.
[00:57:33.640 --> 00:57:35.520]   That's a, that's a big up in the ear one.
[00:57:35.520 --> 00:57:36.520]   I think we'll see that in a minute.
[00:57:36.520 --> 00:57:40.840]   And I hope, I, I think that's the event where they announced Mac Pro's.
[00:57:40.840 --> 00:57:41.840]   When will we be able to buy them?
[00:57:41.840 --> 00:57:44.680]   No, Mac Pro will definitely not be, not be connected to anything else.
[00:57:44.680 --> 00:57:46.240]   It'll be, it'll have its own announcement.
[00:57:46.240 --> 00:57:48.520]   It'll either have its own announcement or won't be announced at all, but it's not, it's not,
[00:57:48.520 --> 00:57:49.840]   it's not, it's not, it's not, it's not, it's not, it's not, it's not, it's not, it's
[00:57:49.840 --> 00:57:50.840]   not, it's not, it's not, it's not, it's not, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's,
[00:57:50.840 --> 00:57:52.840]   they, they probably will, but I think, I think we're looking to end of September, early October,
[00:57:52.840 --> 00:57:55.000]   we're going to see some kind of another event.
[00:57:55.000 --> 00:57:56.200]   I think there'll be a whole nother event.
[00:57:56.200 --> 00:57:58.960]   And I think that they're going to, I think they're going to show my guesses and I have
[00:57:58.960 --> 00:57:59.960]   no information.
[00:57:59.960 --> 00:58:16.280]   So this is like totally me just going like, just going out to get there.
[00:58:16.280 --> 00:58:19.800]   You could fill a whole event if you really underline that, especially if some of those,
[00:58:19.800 --> 00:58:24.080]   I mean, logic just came out, but, but if you had, you know, an update for Final Cut or
[00:58:24.080 --> 00:58:27.360]   he had something else like that, you could, you know, pump that all in and push it all
[00:58:27.360 --> 00:58:29.960]   out, but I don't, they don't tell me anything because I'm on the show.
[00:58:29.960 --> 00:58:33.360]   With the cost of popcorn in a movie these days, you could sell the Mac Pro right next
[00:58:33.360 --> 00:58:36.480]   to it and people would, this sticker should be, the key would be just not exactly.
[00:58:36.480 --> 00:58:40.280]   I mean, they would, they would go, well, it's got, what we're here to do, you put popcorn,
[00:58:40.280 --> 00:58:41.800]   like, like a little thing, it looks like popcorn on top.
[00:58:41.800 --> 00:58:44.000]   It looks like that is a lot, that is really expensive.
[00:58:44.000 --> 00:58:45.000]   Oh, it's got popcorn.
[00:58:45.000 --> 00:58:48.000]   And if you think it just pops the popcorn, the kernels in the tops, right?
[00:58:48.000 --> 00:58:49.880]   Now this is the, what'd be awesome.
[00:58:49.880 --> 00:58:53.840]   This is the thing they showed at the event or is this the movie at?
[00:58:53.840 --> 00:58:54.840]   Yeah.
[00:58:54.840 --> 00:58:57.840]   This is the event, this June event, they showed this.
[00:58:57.840 --> 00:58:58.840]   That's pretty and lovely.
[00:58:58.840 --> 00:59:03.240]   It wouldn't, I mean, Leo, if last year is any indicator, they did Macs with iPads last
[00:59:03.240 --> 00:59:06.440]   year in October and it wouldn't surprise me if you have the Haswell Mac mini, the Haswell
[00:59:06.440 --> 00:59:08.920]   Mac Pro's and the Mac Pro with the new software.
[00:59:08.920 --> 00:59:10.360]   So are they going to have three events?
[00:59:10.360 --> 00:59:12.520]   A iPhone and iPad in the Mac?
[00:59:12.520 --> 00:59:15.120]   They have four hours and they can combine them however they like.
[00:59:15.120 --> 00:59:19.080]   And last year they did iPhone and iPod and then they did iPad and Mac and they could
[00:59:19.080 --> 00:59:20.080]   do this thing.
[00:59:20.080 --> 00:59:21.720]   Yeah, remember how crazy October was?
[00:59:21.720 --> 00:59:23.720]   Last year they announced basically everything new.
[00:59:23.720 --> 00:59:24.720]   New iMac.
[00:59:24.720 --> 00:59:25.720]   And you're along with the iPads?
[00:59:25.720 --> 00:59:26.720]   Yeah.
[00:59:26.720 --> 00:59:30.800]   But I don't know, maybe Alex should have a separate, Alex is right, they should have
[00:59:30.800 --> 00:59:31.800]   a separate.
[00:59:31.800 --> 00:59:33.200]   I don't think you make sense.
[00:59:33.200 --> 00:59:34.200]   Yeah, I think you do it for me.
[00:59:34.200 --> 00:59:38.240]   In fact, do it in, we're in Hollywood, do it, do it, make it, make it, make a statement,
[00:59:38.240 --> 00:59:42.880]   say, you know, I know you think we abandon you and we didn't and we were going to make
[00:59:42.880 --> 00:59:49.480]   the best machine for pros ever with the best software for pros ever, Logic Pro 10, Final
[00:59:49.480 --> 00:59:54.120]   Cut 10.1 Mac Pro.
[00:59:54.120 --> 00:59:57.040]   Let's make, just say, pros we love you.
[00:59:57.040 --> 00:59:58.040]   Group hug.
[00:59:58.040 --> 00:59:59.040]   Do it at the start.
[00:59:59.040 --> 01:00:01.360]   No, I would do that if I were Apple.
[01:00:01.360 --> 01:00:04.880]   Acknowledging that this is a tiny market, it's not an important market on the bottom
[01:00:04.880 --> 01:00:06.880]   line but it's an important thought leader.
[01:00:06.880 --> 01:00:12.640]   But you know, I think that the market is so, the pro market is so pregnant to buy Mac
[01:00:12.640 --> 01:00:13.640]   Pros at this point.
[01:00:13.640 --> 01:00:14.640]   They want to love Apple.
[01:00:14.640 --> 01:00:16.520]   When they release this, it's going to be a big quarter.
[01:00:16.520 --> 01:00:22.120]   Like, especially if they release the Mac mini as well as well as the Mac Pro at the same
[01:00:22.120 --> 01:00:23.120]   time.
[01:00:23.120 --> 01:00:30.200]   It will be one of the biggest set, you know, from just not numbers but one of the largest
[01:00:30.200 --> 01:00:33.640]   revenue quarters for, let's say this is my big prediction.
[01:00:33.640 --> 01:00:36.840]   For whatever quarter they release this in, it will be the largest, it will be the fourth
[01:00:36.840 --> 01:00:38.280]   quarter, it will be the largest.
[01:00:38.280 --> 01:00:39.280]   It'll be the largest.
[01:00:39.280 --> 01:00:40.280]   It'll start saving.
[01:00:40.280 --> 01:00:42.200]   Revenue, Apple is ever generated from their computer.
[01:00:42.200 --> 01:00:44.720]   From their computer, from the CPUs, not from my pads.
[01:00:44.720 --> 01:00:46.400]   Because I have to, I'm going to start saving.
[01:00:46.400 --> 01:00:48.520]   I got to buy an iPhone Gold.
[01:00:48.520 --> 01:00:49.840]   I got to buy a new iPad.
[01:00:49.840 --> 01:00:50.840]   I got to buy it.
[01:00:50.840 --> 01:00:52.200]   If they do a Retina mini, you got to buy that.
[01:00:52.200 --> 01:00:53.200]   You got to buy the Mac Pro.
[01:00:53.200 --> 01:00:57.120]   You got to buy a new Mac Pro with as well.
[01:00:57.120 --> 01:01:00.440]   Holy crap.
[01:01:00.440 --> 01:01:02.920]   I guess that house is out of the question.
[01:01:02.920 --> 01:01:07.920]   I was going to buy a house and then I just went into the Apple store and I, well, I'm
[01:01:07.920 --> 01:01:09.280]   going to have to save up again.
[01:01:09.280 --> 01:01:11.400]   Chris Breen, what do you, we haven't talked to you.
[01:01:11.400 --> 01:01:12.400]   There he goes.
[01:01:12.400 --> 01:01:15.000]   He's getting a drink while I, as soon as I, as soon as you go for the drink, Chris, I
[01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:16.000]   go, Chris Breen.
[01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:17.000]   Yeah.
[01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:18.000]   Oh, I'm good.
[01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:20.440]   He won't be ready for the comical spit tape.
[01:01:20.440 --> 01:01:23.600]   How much is the Mac Pro going to be?
[01:01:23.600 --> 01:01:24.800]   Are you going to buy one?
[01:01:24.800 --> 01:01:25.800]   What is the talk?
[01:01:25.800 --> 01:01:29.160]   What is the scuttle butt on the Mac Pro?
[01:01:29.160 --> 01:01:32.560]   You know, nobody knows where the price is going to be, but it's not going to be cheap.
[01:01:32.560 --> 01:01:39.280]   So I, I pray that that $5,000 number you, you throw around isn't going to be entry level,
[01:01:39.280 --> 01:01:41.560]   but certainly, you know, you could reach there.
[01:01:41.560 --> 01:01:43.520]   Could Apple make everything on?
[01:01:43.520 --> 01:01:50.080]   Couldn't Apple make a stripped down like, you know, statement, a $2,500 one.
[01:01:50.080 --> 01:01:54.520]   And everybody who's expecting three, four, 5,000 goes, even though you never buy that
[01:01:54.520 --> 01:01:56.160]   one, could they make one?
[01:01:56.160 --> 01:01:57.680]   2,500 bucks or maybe not.
[01:01:57.680 --> 01:01:59.920]   Oh, no, let's go for $19.99.
[01:01:59.920 --> 01:02:04.080]   And after you see the whole thing, the garbage can, the thing, the rotating, the lot, the
[01:02:04.080 --> 01:02:06.440]   sun comes up and it's $19.99.
[01:02:06.440 --> 01:02:07.440]   Dan, it's empty.
[01:02:07.440 --> 01:02:08.440]   It's just the shell.
[01:02:08.440 --> 01:02:09.440]   Yeah.
[01:02:09.440 --> 01:02:10.440]   There's no hard.
[01:02:10.440 --> 01:02:11.440]   I'm going to be like the base version.
[01:02:11.440 --> 01:02:14.240]   Just pay a simple $2,000 shipping and handling charge.
[01:02:14.240 --> 01:02:15.240]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:02:15.240 --> 01:02:20.040]   It wouldn't be the one you'd buy, but, but it'd be the one, you know, there's the
[01:02:20.040 --> 01:02:21.040]   lowest numbers and one that happens.
[01:02:21.040 --> 01:02:24.760]   Having some version that you can, that you can publish it in 1995 would would get them
[01:02:24.760 --> 01:02:25.760]   a lot.
[01:02:25.760 --> 01:02:26.760]   And we'll throw in.
[01:02:26.760 --> 01:02:27.760]   Okay, get this.
[01:02:27.760 --> 01:02:30.600]   We'll include Final Cut Logic Pro 10.
[01:02:30.600 --> 01:02:32.920]   Well, that's something I think that they should have done along.
[01:02:32.920 --> 01:02:34.440]   Make a pro bundle.
[01:02:34.440 --> 01:02:35.440]   Yeah.
[01:02:35.440 --> 01:02:36.840]   That's how you make it appealing.
[01:02:36.840 --> 01:02:39.560]   1999 and you get all that software.
[01:02:39.560 --> 01:02:41.560]   Now how much would you pay?
[01:02:41.560 --> 01:02:43.920]   And you get into knives.
[01:02:43.920 --> 01:02:46.760]   So Chris, do you want one?
[01:02:46.760 --> 01:02:48.400]   You know, I'm not sure.
[01:02:48.400 --> 01:02:50.880]   But I have the old Mac Pro in here.
[01:02:50.880 --> 01:02:51.800]   I'm perfectly happy with it.
[01:02:51.800 --> 01:02:54.680]   I like having all my internal storage.
[01:02:54.680 --> 01:02:59.160]   So it just means that if I get the money, it's going to be very octopodenal in the,
[01:02:59.160 --> 01:03:03.680]   there's going to be stuff going all over the place because I do use a lot of storage
[01:03:03.680 --> 01:03:09.920]   and I'm not really prepared to pungal up for a bunch of SSD drives to put into the thing.
[01:03:09.920 --> 01:03:12.560]   So not to mention that none of this stuff exists.
[01:03:12.560 --> 01:03:13.560]   Maybe.
[01:03:13.560 --> 01:03:16.200]   Thunderbolt wise, there is no Thunderbolt 2 hardware.
[01:03:16.200 --> 01:03:18.360]   So you're going to wait.
[01:03:18.360 --> 01:03:19.360]   Right.
[01:03:19.360 --> 01:03:24.880]   By the way, is it to push the rock to pussy in?
[01:03:24.880 --> 01:03:30.000]   I think you're safer going with the D rather than the S. I mean, simply, you know, for
[01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:32.080]   your Google searches.
[01:03:32.080 --> 01:03:33.080]   Yeah.
[01:03:33.080 --> 01:03:38.720]   Sometimes you're just flaunting your lack of FCS over slightly.
[01:03:38.720 --> 01:03:39.720]   Yeah.
[01:03:39.720 --> 01:03:40.720]   Yes.
[01:03:40.720 --> 01:03:41.720]   Show.
[01:03:41.720 --> 01:03:48.040]   As I was saying, I mean, we're still having difficulties with.
[01:03:48.040 --> 01:03:51.640]   With just finding Thunderbolt docks and accessories.
[01:03:51.640 --> 01:03:54.560]   So you're a very high price.
[01:03:54.560 --> 01:03:55.560]   Thunderbolt.
[01:03:55.560 --> 01:03:56.560]   One.
[01:03:56.560 --> 01:03:57.560]   I mean, there's a lot of very expensive.
[01:03:57.560 --> 01:03:58.560]   Yeah.
[01:03:58.560 --> 01:03:59.560]   Yeah.
[01:03:59.560 --> 01:04:02.960]   I hope that the manufacturers get behind it and Apple is helping them in some way to
[01:04:02.960 --> 01:04:04.440]   bring down the price of some of this stuff.
[01:04:04.440 --> 01:04:08.040]   But even you look at some of the, the docks now that people are putting out and they're
[01:04:08.040 --> 01:04:12.920]   still up in the three hundreds simply so you can connect a Thunderbolt cable to it and
[01:04:12.920 --> 01:04:14.840]   then attach all your other stuff.
[01:04:14.840 --> 01:04:19.280]   And so that's where it gets very pudinal or personal depending on.
[01:04:19.280 --> 01:04:20.280]   Showtetel.
[01:04:20.280 --> 01:04:24.680]   That's my problem with it.
[01:04:24.680 --> 01:04:29.720]   And by the way, this is being pointed out in the chat room, but in the middle of the
[01:04:29.720 --> 01:04:33.720]   page for Final Cut, it does say that there's a new Mac Pro is coming and there's a new version
[01:04:33.720 --> 01:04:34.720]   of Final Cut.
[01:04:34.720 --> 01:04:36.720]   Oh, I didn't see that before.
[01:04:36.720 --> 01:04:37.720]   Yeah.
[01:04:37.720 --> 01:04:39.720]   So that you're going to have, but bundle.
[01:04:39.720 --> 01:04:42.840]   Well, and it says 4K broadcast monitoring.
[01:04:42.840 --> 01:04:46.440]   I think that what you're also looking at is, you know, you definitely have to have the
[01:04:46.440 --> 01:04:47.440]   4K monitors.
[01:04:47.440 --> 01:04:49.760]   You have to have, you know, and this becomes for professionals.
[01:04:49.760 --> 01:04:54.080]   I think the hard part for them is that they're not going to have to justify to their penny
[01:04:54.080 --> 01:04:55.080]   pinching.
[01:04:55.080 --> 01:04:57.400]   Our market is getting smaller bosses.
[01:04:57.400 --> 01:05:00.280]   Why they want to spend a lot of money on something else.
[01:05:00.280 --> 01:05:01.280]   Right.
[01:05:01.280 --> 01:05:04.280]   And they could have, you know, this and be able to edit 4K and everything else because
[01:05:04.280 --> 01:05:09.280]   4K is about to become a big deal next year.
[01:05:09.280 --> 01:05:15.800]   I think that Apple could get people to sit up and take notice if they do, if they're
[01:05:15.800 --> 01:05:16.800]   aggressive about this.
[01:05:16.800 --> 01:05:20.240]   And I think they're planning this in some way.
[01:05:20.240 --> 01:05:21.960]   I think we see 4K monitors.
[01:05:21.960 --> 01:05:26.520]   I think that by the end of the year, or by the spring of next year, you see iTunes,
[01:05:26.520 --> 01:05:27.520]   support it.
[01:05:27.520 --> 01:05:28.520]   Okay.
[01:05:28.520 --> 01:05:30.280]   So we have a new aperture, a new Final Cut, new logic.
[01:05:30.280 --> 01:05:32.160]   It all comes bundled.
[01:05:32.160 --> 01:05:34.160]   What else?
[01:05:34.160 --> 01:05:35.160]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:05:35.160 --> 01:05:38.280]   Can we get a group hit on the line of credit for all this?
[01:05:38.280 --> 01:05:39.280]   I know.
[01:05:39.280 --> 01:05:40.880]   Well, you know, I just read a review.
[01:05:40.880 --> 01:05:42.480]   Was it on the non-tech?
[01:05:42.480 --> 01:05:49.400]   There's a new, and prices are dropping on 16, 930-inch displays.
[01:05:49.400 --> 01:05:51.320]   Widescreen 30 inches.
[01:05:51.320 --> 01:05:54.440]   Apple, that, you know, they've got to be looking at these panels of prices are dropping.
[01:05:54.440 --> 01:05:56.600]   Maybe it's their dropping because Apple just bought 18 million of them.
[01:05:56.600 --> 01:05:57.600]   I don't know.
[01:05:57.600 --> 01:06:02.160]   But an 18, a 30-inch cinema display, 4K?
[01:06:02.160 --> 01:06:03.160]   Yep.
[01:06:03.160 --> 01:06:07.680]   Well, and again, I think that people will say that, you know, that people, you know,
[01:06:07.680 --> 01:06:11.720]   will prove my whole thing about 1080p, but 1080, I mean, I mean, let's say it'll be
[01:06:11.720 --> 01:06:16.960]   1080p in TV, it'll be 1080p in film distribution or private 1080p, but the internet's going
[01:06:16.960 --> 01:06:18.760]   to go 4K faster than that.
[01:06:18.760 --> 01:06:19.760]   Really?
[01:06:19.760 --> 01:06:24.720]   Yeah, because that's the big, that is the internet's ability to basically sidestep.
[01:06:24.720 --> 01:06:26.520]   So Netflix is already producing 4K.
[01:06:26.520 --> 01:06:27.520]   Right.
[01:06:27.520 --> 01:06:28.520]   YouTube already allows for 4K.
[01:06:28.520 --> 01:06:29.600]   Who has the bandwidth besides--
[01:06:29.600 --> 01:06:31.800]   H.265 is 50% bigger than--
[01:06:31.800 --> 01:06:32.800]   Kansas City and--
[01:06:32.800 --> 01:06:35.040]   No, H2O Utah and Austin, Texas.
[01:06:35.040 --> 01:06:37.400]   H.265, my house, you know.
[01:06:37.400 --> 01:06:39.120]   But it's small enough, you think.
[01:06:39.120 --> 01:06:44.280]   H.265 is only 50% bigger than an H.264, a 1080p at 4K.
[01:06:44.280 --> 01:06:46.480]   So three megabits would be plenty.
[01:06:46.480 --> 01:06:47.480]   Yep.
[01:06:47.480 --> 01:06:48.480]   Wow.
[01:06:48.480 --> 01:06:49.480]   Wow.
[01:06:49.480 --> 01:06:50.480]   Huge.
[01:06:50.480 --> 01:06:56.000]   But the main thing is that you have-- you have the electronics manufacturers that want
[01:06:56.000 --> 01:07:01.440]   to sell 4K TVs, and you have the internet guys that want to basically drive TV into the
[01:07:01.440 --> 01:07:04.600]   ground, and two of them together can cause a lot of trouble.
[01:07:04.600 --> 01:07:08.200]   And isn't it the case that 4K workflow is very challenging right now?
[01:07:08.200 --> 01:07:09.200]   Yeah.
[01:07:09.200 --> 01:07:14.240]   One of the things that holds it back is it's a big data-- freaking data file.
[01:07:14.240 --> 01:07:17.240]   If you made a machine that could handle 4K workflow--
[01:07:17.240 --> 01:07:18.240]   Yes.
[01:07:18.240 --> 01:07:21.240]   Sony-- I mean, Sony's been trying to do this for a while.
[01:07:21.240 --> 01:07:22.240]   This would be very big.
[01:07:22.240 --> 01:07:23.240]   Right.
[01:07:23.240 --> 01:07:24.240]   Well, and everyone's trying to figure out what to do.
[01:07:24.240 --> 01:07:27.480]   And part of it right now is that everyone-- like when they-- what they're talking about
[01:07:27.480 --> 01:07:31.600]   right now with 4K, if you go to NAB, is they talk about the fact that you can zoom in on
[01:07:31.600 --> 01:07:32.600]   it.
[01:07:32.600 --> 01:07:37.240]   They're talking to broadcasters who are trying to figure out, well, I-- because no-- almost
[01:07:37.240 --> 01:07:42.720]   all the broadcasters except for maybe Discovery Channel will stay with 1080p-- well, no,
[01:07:42.720 --> 01:07:43.720]   but to start--
[01:07:43.720 --> 01:07:45.640]   Shh, we can 4K, baby, next year.
[01:07:45.640 --> 01:07:48.160]   You can see the fake megalodon.
[01:07:48.160 --> 01:07:53.160]   But Discovery tends to be a little bit ahead of the curve on a lot of those things, even
[01:07:53.160 --> 01:07:55.160]   3D or everything else, just because it's--
[01:07:55.160 --> 01:07:56.160]   It's gorgeous content.
[01:07:56.160 --> 01:07:59.160]   --a visual network.
[01:07:59.160 --> 01:08:00.160]   But the--
[01:08:00.160 --> 01:08:01.160]   That bikini TV.
[01:08:01.160 --> 01:08:03.160]   I'm going to see those things in 4K.
[01:08:03.160 --> 01:08:04.160]   OK, sure.
[01:08:04.160 --> 01:08:05.160]   It's out.
[01:08:05.160 --> 01:08:06.160]   Certain things that don't belong in--
[01:08:06.160 --> 01:08:07.160]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:08:07.160 --> 01:08:08.160]   --in the '90s.
[01:08:08.160 --> 01:08:09.160]   Yes.
[01:08:09.160 --> 01:08:15.560]   But I think that-- you know, as I said, we put up a 4K years ago on YouTube of Macbreak
[01:08:15.560 --> 01:08:19.800]   video just to see how hard it was going to be.
[01:08:19.800 --> 01:08:20.800]   And years ago, it was very hard.
[01:08:20.800 --> 01:08:24.040]   But now we're having-- Blackmagic cameras are going to be easy to buy.
[01:08:24.040 --> 01:08:27.720]   I've got one more data point, which is that I just bought a new HDTV.
[01:08:27.720 --> 01:08:29.720]   Oh, we're definitely going to put a--
[01:08:29.720 --> 01:08:30.720]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:08:30.720 --> 01:08:31.720]   One more data point.
[01:08:31.720 --> 01:08:33.720]   I just bought that 1080p TV.
[01:08:33.720 --> 01:08:35.720]   And it's-- most of it's BS.
[01:08:35.720 --> 01:08:37.720]   I mean, the bottom line is is that unless you--
[01:08:37.720 --> 01:08:38.720]   Really?
[01:08:38.720 --> 01:08:39.720]   For a TV, unless--
[01:08:39.720 --> 01:08:41.720]   55 inches, you're not going to see a big difference in 4K.
[01:08:41.720 --> 01:08:44.720]   You really start seeing 4K at 65, 70, 80.
[01:08:44.720 --> 01:08:45.720]   Yeah.
[01:08:45.720 --> 01:08:47.720]   You know, those are the numbers that you want to see.
[01:08:47.720 --> 01:08:50.720]   And that's why you can get cheap ones out of 55 inches, but you're not currently.
[01:08:50.720 --> 01:08:51.720]   Right.
[01:08:51.720 --> 01:08:52.720]   Big projectors.
[01:08:52.720 --> 01:08:53.720]   You will see it with tech.
[01:08:53.720 --> 01:08:55.720]   So Alex, do you care that you can't swap out the video cards in the Mac Pro?
[01:08:55.720 --> 01:08:56.720]   Not really.
[01:08:56.720 --> 01:08:57.720]   Or are you fine with--
[01:08:57.720 --> 01:08:59.720]   If they're going to handle 2 4K streams out of those--
[01:08:59.720 --> 01:09:03.720]   out of those-- out of those, the chances are I'm not going to do anything with them anyway.
[01:09:03.720 --> 01:09:09.720]   I mean, I don't-- you know, it's not-- there's so few video cards that support-- that are
[01:09:09.720 --> 01:09:12.720]   supported on the Mac anyway, you have very few choices.
[01:09:12.720 --> 01:09:16.520]   It's not like you can just go out to the store and buy a new one anyway, because the issue
[01:09:16.520 --> 01:09:21.640]   is is that Apple, because so much of the OS runs on the GPU, Apple is very, very touchy.
[01:09:21.640 --> 01:09:23.280]   They want to write all the drivers.
[01:09:23.280 --> 01:09:27.160]   And the video-- and then Nvidia wants to write all the drivers.
[01:09:27.160 --> 01:09:31.560]   And so the two of them don't agree, and then you end up with nothing.
[01:09:31.560 --> 01:09:35.600]   So the thing is, there's not that many choices from a Mac user's perspective on video cards
[01:09:35.600 --> 01:09:39.160]   anyway, so the fact that I can't take them out doesn't mean anything.
[01:09:39.160 --> 01:09:40.160]   OK.
[01:09:40.160 --> 01:09:42.160]   And that is my opinion.
[01:09:42.160 --> 01:09:45.960]   The only people care about it are people who don't want to use OpenCL.
[01:09:45.960 --> 01:09:46.960]   They want OpenGL support.
[01:09:46.960 --> 01:09:47.960]   Well, they have OpenGL.
[01:09:47.960 --> 01:09:48.960]   I mean, it'll support--
[01:09:48.960 --> 01:09:49.960]   Yeah, but Apple's OpenGL drivers.
[01:09:49.960 --> 01:09:52.960]   Not maybe they'll do new ones.
[01:09:52.960 --> 01:09:54.960]   But for this one, they're going to build it all.
[01:09:54.960 --> 01:09:55.960]   What did you--
[01:09:55.960 --> 01:09:56.960]   the OpenGL stuff.
[01:09:56.960 --> 01:10:01.520]   And what happens on the PC is that a lot of people can overwrite the drivers and optimize
[01:10:01.520 --> 01:10:07.240]   it for specific games or for gaming in general, where on the Mac, Apple writes their own drivers.
[01:10:07.240 --> 01:10:08.240]   That's true.
[01:10:08.240 --> 01:10:10.200]   But they're not optimized for every game, and they're not optimized for gaming.
[01:10:10.200 --> 01:10:13.920]   They're optimized for OpenCL, and for general purpose computing and scientific stuff.
[01:10:13.920 --> 01:10:16.080]   So it's just a question of the drivers aren't bad.
[01:10:16.080 --> 01:10:19.280]   They're just not targeted for what a lot of consumers want to do with those kind of graphics
[01:10:19.280 --> 01:10:20.280]   cards.
[01:10:20.280 --> 01:10:24.920]   Yeah, because I put in a high-end new card in the OpenGL performance was not improved
[01:10:24.920 --> 01:10:26.920]   at all on my Mac Pro.
[01:10:26.920 --> 01:10:27.920]   Yeah, for games.
[01:10:27.920 --> 01:10:28.920]   It's very disappointed.
[01:10:28.920 --> 01:10:29.920]   Yeah, for game.
[01:10:29.920 --> 01:10:32.960]   But the guys that are-- I mean, I don't think this is a good game in computer.
[01:10:32.960 --> 01:10:34.920]   I will say that, because you can't stupid up the game.
[01:10:34.920 --> 01:10:37.080]   You know what's a great home theater PC.
[01:10:37.080 --> 01:10:38.080]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:10:38.080 --> 01:10:39.080]   Two of them, Leo.
[01:10:39.080 --> 01:10:41.680]   One on each side of the TV.
[01:10:41.680 --> 01:10:45.880]   You know, a souped up Mac Mini is a pretty awesome-- I mean, I have a-- I use a Mac Mini
[01:10:45.880 --> 01:10:46.880]   at the house for my--
[01:10:46.880 --> 01:10:51.720]   Yeah, but I got that OLED TV with the curves on it, so I think it should have the Mac
[01:10:51.720 --> 01:10:52.720]   Pro next to it.
[01:10:52.720 --> 01:10:53.720]   I mean, it's a cosmetic choice.
[01:10:53.720 --> 01:10:54.720]   It's a cosmetic choice.
[01:10:54.720 --> 01:10:55.720]   Yeah, it's cosmetic.
[01:10:55.720 --> 01:11:00.200]   I was having a conversation with somebody on Twitter who was saying, "Hey, I've pretty
[01:11:00.200 --> 01:11:04.400]   much figured out that I can either buy a maxed out 27-inch iMac or I'm going to buy
[01:11:04.400 --> 01:11:05.400]   a Mac Pro.
[01:11:05.400 --> 01:11:09.200]   It's going to be worth like the extra $1,000, $2,000."
[01:11:09.200 --> 01:11:16.040]   And with through the depth and breadth of information exchange that Twitter allows,
[01:11:16.040 --> 01:11:19.880]   the main point that I wanted to make to them is that it's-- depending on what you do with
[01:11:19.880 --> 01:11:21.720]   your computer, it's possible that--
[01:11:21.720 --> 01:11:29.520]   And a $3,000 iMac plus $1,000 worth of really good desk and really good chair could make
[01:11:29.520 --> 01:11:34.840]   for a more productive setup than simply a $4,000 Mac Pro and whatever card table you're
[01:11:34.840 --> 01:11:35.840]   using right now.
[01:11:35.840 --> 01:11:40.120]   I mean, it's like spend every dollar in your budget very, very smartly.
[01:11:40.120 --> 01:11:45.080]   And it's not always about obviously buying more CPU, more storage, more pipe, more everything
[01:11:45.080 --> 01:11:46.080]   of that.
[01:11:46.080 --> 01:11:50.880]   I mean, to Alex's point, I mean, we tried to do one 4K five-minute video for Talk Mobile
[01:11:50.880 --> 01:11:53.560]   and it took on a modern Mac book pro.
[01:11:53.560 --> 01:11:57.240]   It took, I think, two or three days to render out a final cut 10 and then it took forever
[01:11:57.240 --> 01:11:58.240]   to upload.
[01:11:58.240 --> 01:12:02.120]   And at that point, we would have happily thrown money at that problem because we had way less
[01:12:02.120 --> 01:12:03.840]   time than we had money.
[01:12:03.840 --> 01:12:09.080]   And if a Mac Pro could fix that problem, then we would have probably done a lot more 4K video.
[01:12:09.080 --> 01:12:15.400]   I have to say that when I put Windows on my Mac Pro and run the OpenGL drivers and gaming
[01:12:15.400 --> 01:12:18.320]   on Windows, it's a great fast machine.
[01:12:18.320 --> 01:12:19.320]   So--
[01:12:19.320 --> 01:12:20.320]   It's the OS.
[01:12:20.320 --> 01:12:21.320]   It's totally OS specific.
[01:12:21.320 --> 01:12:26.000]   So you could probably get a pretty good gaming machine if you put Windows on this.
[01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:27.800]   Windows on your Mac.
[01:12:27.800 --> 01:12:28.800]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:12:28.800 --> 01:12:30.240]   That would be crisis in all runs.
[01:12:30.240 --> 01:12:31.240]   That would be great.
[01:12:31.240 --> 01:12:35.960]   I don't know why you would, but you could.
[01:12:35.960 --> 01:12:36.960]   All right.
[01:12:36.960 --> 01:12:40.560]   So the reason I brought up the movies and we got sidetracked on the ad for the Mac Pro
[01:12:40.560 --> 01:12:44.200]   is because some of us went to see jobs.
[01:12:44.200 --> 01:12:45.800]   The Ashton Kutcher version.
[01:12:45.800 --> 01:12:47.680]   There's two movies about Steve Jobs coming.
[01:12:47.680 --> 01:12:48.680]   Do not be confused.
[01:12:48.680 --> 01:12:53.280]   This is the first one that was shown at Sundance last year with Ashton Kutcher mimicking the
[01:12:53.280 --> 01:12:55.400]   walk.
[01:12:55.400 --> 01:12:59.280]   And then there is the one based on the Walter Isaacson book, which Sony bought the rights
[01:12:59.280 --> 01:13:01.000]   to and Aaron Sorkin is writing.
[01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:02.480]   And we don't know much about that.
[01:13:02.480 --> 01:13:04.560]   That is not going to be out for a while.
[01:13:04.560 --> 01:13:06.920]   So Renee Richie, you saw jobs.
[01:13:06.920 --> 01:13:08.240]   Andy Inako, you saw jobs.
[01:13:08.240 --> 01:13:09.640]   I saw jobs.
[01:13:09.640 --> 01:13:12.040]   But these two poor guys have not seen it.
[01:13:12.040 --> 01:13:13.040]   We've got no jobs.
[01:13:13.040 --> 01:13:14.040]   We've got no jobs.
[01:13:14.040 --> 01:13:18.640]   So should they go see it, Andy Inako?
[01:13:18.640 --> 01:13:20.280]   If it's on Netflix, I would watch it.
[01:13:20.280 --> 01:13:22.160]   I wouldn't spend $11 to go see it.
[01:13:22.160 --> 01:13:24.880]   No, I wouldn't spend 50 cents to go see it.
[01:13:24.880 --> 01:13:25.880]   How about you?
[01:13:25.880 --> 01:13:26.880]   What do you think?
[01:13:26.880 --> 01:13:29.680]   I thought that it would have been a great after school special, but I would like to
[01:13:29.680 --> 01:13:30.680]   ask that.
[01:13:30.680 --> 01:13:32.960]   I wouldn't be able to watch it.
[01:13:32.960 --> 01:13:33.960]   Yeah.
[01:13:33.960 --> 01:13:41.000]   I mean, Renee, my thought is that I really compared it to all those turn classic movies,
[01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:46.480]   movies that they made in the '30s or '40s, young Abe Lincoln boy Edison where they take
[01:13:46.480 --> 01:13:52.680]   like what are the common knowledge bullet points of a famous person's life and okay,
[01:13:52.680 --> 01:13:56.640]   let's make a fictional story that includes those bullet points.
[01:13:56.640 --> 01:14:01.600]   The way I would describe jobs is that it's a perfectly fine B movie.
[01:14:01.600 --> 01:14:06.720]   If this is your goal for entertainment tonight, you're not going to get it from this movie.
[01:14:06.720 --> 01:14:11.520]   But if this were like on a twin bill with the conversation, you might appreciate it as,
[01:14:11.520 --> 01:14:13.640]   okay, it's not terribly made.
[01:14:13.640 --> 01:14:17.240]   There are some moments in it that are quite good.
[01:14:17.240 --> 01:14:19.880]   You just don't.
[01:14:19.880 --> 01:14:24.080]   It's sort of like the plate of a very, very average onion rings that proceeds a really
[01:14:24.080 --> 01:14:25.600]   beautiful steak.
[01:14:25.600 --> 01:14:29.400]   And then so you adds up to a very good meal, but you would not want to make a meal.
[01:14:29.400 --> 01:14:33.200]   This is the movie you wanted to see.
[01:14:33.200 --> 01:14:34.960]   This one right here.
[01:14:34.960 --> 01:14:36.400]   Can you hear my audio?
[01:14:36.400 --> 01:14:37.400]   No.
[01:14:37.400 --> 01:14:39.320]   Can't hear my audio.
[01:14:39.320 --> 01:14:41.240]   That's a shame.
[01:14:41.240 --> 01:14:44.120]   This is no a Wiley as Steve Jobs.
[01:14:44.120 --> 01:14:48.760]   And while they don't look like jobs in Wozniak, this is Pirates of Silicon Valley much closer.
[01:14:48.760 --> 01:14:49.760]   That's the point.
[01:14:49.760 --> 01:14:52.840]   I mean, like Ashton Kutcher did what looked to me like a bad Saturday Night Live skit,
[01:14:52.840 --> 01:14:54.760]   especially the opening of the movie.
[01:14:54.760 --> 01:14:58.680]   It was so disturbing to watch him try to ape Steve Jobs.
[01:14:58.680 --> 01:15:02.260]   Only when he relaxed and forgot about that was it a little bit charming, but where they
[01:15:02.260 --> 01:15:08.200]   chose to start it and end it and a lot of the decisions in between were just vexing horrible.
[01:15:08.200 --> 01:15:09.680]   I mean, it was weird.
[01:15:09.680 --> 01:15:11.680]   It was weird and I think you could tell.
[01:15:11.680 --> 01:15:13.880]   This is Pirates of Silicon Valley.
[01:15:13.880 --> 01:15:16.160]   And by the way, there's some of the scenes are the same in here.
[01:15:16.160 --> 01:15:19.480]   For instance, in a little bit, there's a West Coast computer fair, which looks exactly
[01:15:19.480 --> 01:15:21.840]   like the one in the movie.
[01:15:21.840 --> 01:15:24.560]   And while they didn't know it then, their paths would cross.
[01:15:24.560 --> 01:15:26.480]   There's something really going on out there in California.
[01:15:26.480 --> 01:15:27.680]   To change their lives.
[01:15:27.680 --> 01:15:29.520]   That scene is also in the Jobs movie.
[01:15:29.520 --> 01:15:31.280]   It's like they copied it.
[01:15:31.280 --> 01:15:32.280]   Good.
[01:15:32.280 --> 01:15:35.680]   Now that is the homebrew computer club, and that was the reaction they got.
[01:15:35.680 --> 01:15:40.680]   Yeah.
[01:15:40.680 --> 01:15:45.600]   This is the movie you should watch.
[01:15:45.600 --> 01:15:50.880]   They're raised to the time to turn technical evolution into cultural revolution.
[01:15:50.880 --> 01:15:54.320]   You guys are supposed to be writing programs.
[01:15:54.320 --> 01:15:56.320]   You demolished that guy.
[01:15:56.320 --> 01:15:58.120]   That's all you know how to do is tear people down.
[01:15:58.120 --> 01:15:59.920]   Steve Jobs is killing us.
[01:15:59.920 --> 01:16:02.640]   They make the stuff for selling IBM, look about a decade at a date.
[01:16:02.640 --> 01:16:03.640]   I want it.
[01:16:03.640 --> 01:16:04.640]   It's apples.
[01:16:04.640 --> 01:16:05.640]   We can't just go.
[01:16:05.640 --> 01:16:06.640]   That's Gates.
[01:16:06.640 --> 01:16:07.640]   Nailed it.
[01:16:07.640 --> 01:16:08.640]   Snealed it.
[01:16:08.640 --> 01:16:09.640]   It's not a joke.
[01:16:09.640 --> 01:16:10.640]   I'm not missing the mafia.
[01:16:10.640 --> 01:16:13.640]   I keep your friends close and your enemies close.
[01:16:13.640 --> 01:16:16.640]   We're here for our 9.30 with your president.
[01:16:16.640 --> 01:16:17.640]   There's two cakes.
[01:16:17.640 --> 01:16:20.640]   Actually, this is better because you get the whole story, right?
[01:16:20.640 --> 01:16:22.640]   It only goes up to 1999 though.
[01:16:22.640 --> 01:16:23.640]   You'll pay right hand for you.
[01:16:23.640 --> 01:16:26.640]   Well, that's a fake that's sold us to Jobs movie.
[01:16:26.640 --> 01:16:34.640]   The Jobs movie starts and ends in 2001 with the introduction of the iPod.
[01:16:34.640 --> 01:16:35.640]   I guess you're right.
[01:16:35.640 --> 01:16:37.360]   Well, that's really good.
[01:16:37.360 --> 01:16:42.720]   It's like there's a point at which I feel as though they had a whole bunch of material
[01:16:42.720 --> 01:16:53.120]   and an informed source that stopped following Apple at around 1985, '86, '87 because there's
[01:16:53.120 --> 01:16:56.200]   a point at which they pretend to have knowledge about it.
[01:16:56.200 --> 01:16:57.560]   Here's how the Mac was developed.
[01:16:57.560 --> 01:16:58.720]   Here's how the Apple was developed.
[01:16:58.720 --> 01:17:00.400]   All wrong, but okay.
[01:17:00.400 --> 01:17:01.760]   Then there's a point which, you know what?
[01:17:01.760 --> 01:17:03.800]   I think at this point, everyone wants this movie.
[01:17:03.800 --> 01:17:06.200]   They're fascinated by the boardroom struggles.
[01:17:06.200 --> 01:17:11.000]   Let's talk, stop, talk about creating and innovating the role of technology in society.
[01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:13.480]   Let's just start talking about fights inside the boardroom.
[01:17:13.480 --> 01:17:16.480]   Dumb men in bad early '80s suits.
[01:17:16.480 --> 01:17:19.840]   Let's make that focus in the movie for the last 45 minutes.
[01:17:19.840 --> 01:17:22.520]   I'm not sure that was a good idea, right?
[01:17:22.520 --> 01:17:24.640]   Well, yeah, the pacing was so odd too.
[01:17:24.640 --> 01:17:28.080]   I mean, they spent so much time at the beginning and then next is a montage, like a two minute
[01:17:28.080 --> 01:17:29.080]   montage.
[01:17:29.080 --> 01:17:30.080]   Right.
[01:17:30.080 --> 01:17:31.600]   They left so much out and they made up stuff.
[01:17:31.600 --> 01:17:36.080]   But, you know, the Disney-ac, well, we should mention that the Dan Kocky was the primary
[01:17:36.080 --> 01:17:37.080]   source for this.
[01:17:37.080 --> 01:17:44.080]   So you nailed it, Andy, that Dan was not involved in Apple after the stock release he
[01:17:44.080 --> 01:17:45.880]   left in a huff.
[01:17:45.880 --> 01:17:48.480]   And they do have a lot about that for some reason.
[01:17:48.480 --> 01:17:51.200]   They don't mention Pixar at all.
[01:17:51.200 --> 01:17:52.200]   Yeah.
[01:17:52.200 --> 01:17:56.920]   And there's a scene with what-- Next is all about, they have one, like one
[01:17:56.920 --> 01:18:02.480]   cup magazine cover or one screenshot and that represents his entire years of net next,
[01:18:02.480 --> 01:18:06.240]   which is like you could do the entire movie based entirely on the time at next and I think
[01:18:06.240 --> 01:18:07.240]   you would-- Yeah, there's--
[01:18:07.240 --> 01:18:08.240]   Well, that's the part of the problem.
[01:18:08.240 --> 01:18:09.240]   Well, that's the part of the problem.
[01:18:09.240 --> 01:18:10.240]   One next photo.
[01:18:10.240 --> 01:18:13.960]   That's part of the problem is that how do you get a lifelike's jobs, which was an amazing
[01:18:13.960 --> 01:18:15.480]   rich, in this life.
[01:18:15.480 --> 01:18:19.160]   But in two hours, I don't know if you-- but I think some of the choices they made were
[01:18:19.160 --> 01:18:20.160]   bad.
[01:18:20.160 --> 01:18:26.280]   And then there's the scene with Woz tearfully leaving Apple, which never happened because
[01:18:26.280 --> 01:18:30.920]   Woz was in fact invited to the Mac team and then crashed his plane and almost died and
[01:18:30.920 --> 01:18:33.200]   was away for several years recovering.
[01:18:33.200 --> 01:18:37.720]   There was no tearful goodbye that was made up.
[01:18:37.720 --> 01:18:39.080]   And there were-- and just--
[01:18:39.080 --> 01:18:41.080]   That's OK.
[01:18:41.080 --> 01:18:47.160]   I mean, given that I love the movie 1776, it did not shock me as a kid to find out that
[01:18:47.160 --> 01:18:51.080]   no, everybody did not sign the Declaration of Independence on July 4th, this dramatic
[01:18:51.080 --> 01:18:52.080]   license.
[01:18:52.080 --> 01:18:55.720]   My overall problem with the movie is that it really is fan fiction.
[01:18:55.720 --> 01:19:01.040]   It really is some guy who's a huge fan of Apple writing down-- basically say, oh, we
[01:19:01.040 --> 01:19:08.040]   got to do the scene in which Steve Jobs says, oh, by the way, Woz, we're getting paid $500
[01:19:08.040 --> 01:19:10.600]   to do this, even though I'm being pocketing $7,000.
[01:19:10.600 --> 01:19:13.200]   And we have to-- oh, yes, you'll be a scene with her.
[01:19:13.200 --> 01:19:14.840]   It's like a Steve Jobs keynote.
[01:19:14.840 --> 01:19:15.840]   Oh, no.
[01:19:15.840 --> 01:19:18.880]   And it's not about writing, crafting a real intelligent story.
[01:19:18.880 --> 01:19:23.360]   It's about finally being the guy who gets to write all the scenes that you've always seen
[01:19:23.360 --> 01:19:25.360]   played out and you would love to see again.
[01:19:25.360 --> 01:19:26.360]   I think that's a good way to play it.
[01:19:26.360 --> 01:19:27.360]   Fan fiction.
[01:19:27.360 --> 01:19:28.360]   Yeah.
[01:19:28.360 --> 01:19:30.640]   The other thing to point out is that Ashton is terrible.
[01:19:30.640 --> 01:19:32.160]   He's not a good actor.
[01:19:32.160 --> 01:19:36.600]   He's-- again, I'm sorry, I'm slipping into film critic mode.
[01:19:36.600 --> 01:19:41.640]   My difficulty with him is that he-- it wasn't until I saw this movie that I really realized
[01:19:41.640 --> 01:19:42.640]   it.
[01:19:42.640 --> 01:19:48.600]   Every person who is a screen actor, they've got some quality that says, please give me
[01:19:48.600 --> 01:19:49.840]   your attention right here.
[01:19:49.840 --> 01:19:50.840]   I am interesting.
[01:19:50.840 --> 01:19:52.800]   I am worthy of your focus.
[01:19:52.800 --> 01:19:56.080]   And he's surrounded by-- he's playing against James Woods.
[01:19:56.080 --> 01:19:57.080]   James Woods.
[01:19:57.080 --> 01:19:58.760]   He's playing against Matthew Modine.
[01:19:58.760 --> 01:20:01.200]   He's playing against a lot of really good actors.
[01:20:01.200 --> 01:20:06.640]   And you notice that in no scene, do your eyes go to Ashton Kutcher?
[01:20:06.640 --> 01:20:12.920]   They always go to-- they go to Sam Levine, who has two-- who's a freaks and geeks.
[01:20:12.920 --> 01:20:13.920]   Really great guy.
[01:20:13.920 --> 01:20:17.000]   I like almost everything that he's ever been in.
[01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:21.640]   But he has like one line in the-- in Johnny Ives design shop.
[01:20:21.640 --> 01:20:24.840]   And he's in a room with Steve-- supposedly Steve Jobs.
[01:20:24.840 --> 01:20:29.520]   And you're looking at this other actor who has one line because he has screen presence
[01:20:29.520 --> 01:20:31.160]   in Ashton Kutcher does not.
[01:20:31.160 --> 01:20:32.400]   And he smirks a lot.
[01:20:32.400 --> 01:20:35.880]   And then the worst thing-- and he made a big deal about learning how Steve Jobs walked.
[01:20:35.880 --> 01:20:36.880]   Yeah.
[01:20:36.880 --> 01:20:37.880]   Horrible.
[01:20:37.880 --> 01:20:38.880]   It was like walking dead.
[01:20:38.880 --> 01:20:39.880]   It was like a zombie.
[01:20:39.880 --> 01:20:43.120]   And he doesn't even-- he doesn't even employ it until later.
[01:20:43.120 --> 01:20:47.480]   It's like he learned it in the middle of making the movie and then started doing it.
[01:20:47.480 --> 01:20:49.480]   It's just-- it's-- oh, god, it's a mess.
[01:20:49.480 --> 01:20:54.080]   And I saw-- I saw just that one-- that one clip with was and jobs and--
[01:20:54.080 --> 01:20:55.080]   Yeah, that was-- in the parking garage.
[01:20:55.080 --> 01:20:56.560]   It was that bad.
[01:20:56.560 --> 01:20:58.000]   I saw that one clip.
[01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:01.440]   And I thought to myself, maybe I'll watch it on Netflix someday.
[01:21:01.440 --> 01:21:01.960]   But that was it.
[01:21:01.960 --> 01:21:05.080]   Like it was like literally that-- that clip was not the one to release because it was
[01:21:05.080 --> 01:21:08.480]   so bad that immediately it was-- I was like, I am never watching this in the theater.
[01:21:08.480 --> 01:21:10.560]   I'll-- I will say this.
[01:21:10.560 --> 01:21:16.160]   The one-- one of the positive aspects of this movie is that it really gave me an appetite
[01:21:16.160 --> 01:21:18.120]   for a movie about Steve Wozniak.
[01:21:18.120 --> 01:21:19.120]   Right.
[01:21:19.120 --> 01:21:24.920]   That would be a movie about creativity and passion and joy and reinvention.
[01:21:24.920 --> 01:21:28.200]   And that would be the most positive and uplifting movie.
[01:21:28.200 --> 01:21:33.400]   Not that Steve Wozniak has had a life that's always been highly positive, I'm sure.
[01:21:33.400 --> 01:21:37.160]   But you look at the arc of his story and it's like that's something that I would like my
[01:21:37.160 --> 01:21:38.960]   children to hear about.
[01:21:38.960 --> 01:21:42.800]   Especially the way he's-- he lives his life now.
[01:21:42.800 --> 01:21:45.600]   It's like that would be-- that would be a wonderful movie.
[01:21:45.600 --> 01:21:48.560]   That would be-- I would not wait for that to stream.
[01:21:48.560 --> 01:21:50.280]   I would actually pay a lot of dollars for that.
[01:21:50.280 --> 01:21:51.280]   And if Hollywood does it--
[01:21:51.280 --> 01:21:52.280]   I would fix that.
[01:21:52.280 --> 01:21:54.360]   It will be even more insulting than this one, unfortunately.
[01:21:54.360 --> 01:21:55.360]   Yeah, but I think--
[01:21:55.360 --> 01:21:56.360]   Hey, Mike George Clooney.
[01:21:56.360 --> 01:21:57.360]   Yeah.
[01:21:57.360 --> 01:21:58.960]   Well, at least they would have dialogue.
[01:21:58.960 --> 01:22:03.240]   Like, do you notice that like every single person-- again, fan fiction because even when
[01:22:03.240 --> 01:22:08.360]   like someone's like yelling at Steve and like throwing him out of place like, Steve Jobs,
[01:22:08.360 --> 01:22:12.960]   you may be a brilliant visionary who has ideas that will change this world and I have
[01:22:12.960 --> 01:22:15.200]   to ask you to put shoes on.
[01:22:15.200 --> 01:22:16.200]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:22:16.200 --> 01:22:17.200]   So bad.
[01:22:17.200 --> 01:22:18.200]   So bad.
[01:22:18.200 --> 01:22:19.200]   It was like, OK.
[01:22:19.200 --> 01:22:20.200]   Yeah.
[01:22:20.200 --> 01:22:21.680]   I think you're a little bit fond of the guy.
[01:22:21.680 --> 01:22:22.680]   That's fine.
[01:22:22.680 --> 01:22:23.680]   You wouldn't make a movie about somebody you hated.
[01:22:23.680 --> 01:22:25.680]   You would, but you wouldn't put lines back.
[01:22:25.680 --> 01:22:26.680]   I think--
[01:22:26.680 --> 01:22:28.920]   But "Sorkin" book is going to be just as bad because "Sorkin" hates the internet,
[01:22:28.920 --> 01:22:29.920]   hates geeks, hates computers.
[01:22:29.920 --> 01:22:33.480]   Well, there is a movie in which whoever plays Steve Jobs is going to have to get the walk
[01:22:33.480 --> 01:22:37.280]   down because it's going to be one long scene of him walking and people breathing him.
[01:22:37.280 --> 01:22:38.280]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:22:38.280 --> 01:22:39.280]   That's right.
[01:22:39.280 --> 01:22:40.880]   Katie Cotton is right behind him.
[01:22:40.880 --> 01:22:43.680]   The question is how many-- how many "Sorkinisms" will be included?
[01:22:43.680 --> 01:22:46.360]   Oh, it'll be loaded with all of them.
[01:22:46.360 --> 01:22:47.360]   It's the same.
[01:22:47.360 --> 01:22:48.360]   It's the same.
[01:22:48.360 --> 01:22:49.360]   Yeah, it's intended to pick up Alex.
[01:22:49.360 --> 01:22:55.280]   My recommendation, although it got some justified criticism, I think, is still read the Walter
[01:22:55.280 --> 01:22:56.520]   Isaacson book.
[01:22:56.520 --> 01:22:59.920]   I think it's really worth reading.
[01:22:59.920 --> 01:23:02.640]   One of the complaints was that Isaacson himself didn't really understand technology
[01:23:02.640 --> 01:23:04.240]   that will ask some of the wrong questions.
[01:23:04.240 --> 01:23:08.000]   Nevertheless, as of right now, that's the best choice out there.
[01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:11.480]   It shares a problem with the Jobs movie in that.
[01:23:11.480 --> 01:23:20.360]   I think the one big thing that they missed is that the light that goes into creation
[01:23:20.360 --> 01:23:21.360]   like that.
[01:23:21.360 --> 01:23:24.920]   There's so many-- we were also familiar with stories behind the creation of the Macintosh
[01:23:24.920 --> 01:23:28.280]   and they're not all about people parking in handicapped parking spaces.
[01:23:28.280 --> 01:23:31.520]   It's about people staying up all night because they suddenly had an idea that I bet there's
[01:23:31.520 --> 01:23:35.760]   a way that I can get Scrooge McDuck onto the screen and I know that I've got other places
[01:23:35.760 --> 01:23:38.960]   to go to, but I'm going to stay up all night because I want to show somebody Scrooge McDuck
[01:23:38.960 --> 01:23:42.600]   on the screen of this new computer and just blow people's minds.
[01:23:42.600 --> 01:23:47.680]   And you just never see that kind of joy that the engineers and software developers put
[01:23:47.680 --> 01:23:50.040]   into so much of technology.
[01:23:50.040 --> 01:23:53.520]   That's what I'd love to see reflected in a modern movie.
[01:23:53.520 --> 01:23:54.520]   Never going to happen, of course, but--
[01:23:54.520 --> 01:23:55.520]   Likewise.
[01:23:55.520 --> 01:24:02.400]   Maybe that's the internet movie, the 4K internet movie, first on a Mac Pro.
[01:24:02.400 --> 01:24:04.480]   There you go.
[01:24:04.480 --> 01:24:07.840]   The amount of RAM inside the first Apple II computer.
[01:24:07.840 --> 01:24:09.840]   So full circle.
[01:24:09.840 --> 01:24:12.120]   So we've got to go all the way around.
[01:24:12.120 --> 01:24:15.920]   4K.
[01:24:15.920 --> 01:24:17.440]   Malware on the Apple Store.
[01:24:17.440 --> 01:24:20.960]   Should we worry the app store?
[01:24:20.960 --> 01:24:27.880]   This new technique allows malware authors to create apparently benign apps, especially
[01:24:27.880 --> 01:24:31.080]   since Apple doesn't really apparently look at them for more than a few seconds in some
[01:24:31.080 --> 01:24:36.840]   cases, and then remotely assemble them to create malware.
[01:24:36.840 --> 01:24:41.640]   This was a couple of researchers got malicious apps on the app store.
[01:24:41.640 --> 01:24:44.880]   The researcher says the company's review process runs at least some programs for only
[01:24:44.880 --> 01:24:47.400]   a few seconds before giving the green light.
[01:24:47.400 --> 01:24:51.280]   This was a Georgia Tech team.
[01:24:51.280 --> 01:24:55.320]   Not enough apparently to notice that there were code fragments that later reassembled
[01:24:55.320 --> 01:24:59.520]   themselves into malware.
[01:24:59.520 --> 01:25:04.680]   We had Nick Arnott, our security writer, look into it and he spoke to the Georgia Tech
[01:25:04.680 --> 01:25:06.240]   researchers too.
[01:25:06.240 --> 01:25:09.760]   This is an incredibly difficult problem because they're basically putting a benign app into
[01:25:09.760 --> 01:25:14.760]   the app store with a lot of strings that are just buried that it would take a lot.
[01:25:14.760 --> 01:25:16.640]   The app store is a binary process.
[01:25:16.640 --> 01:25:20.760]   They do have mechanical checks, sorry, not mechanical, computerized checks.
[01:25:20.760 --> 01:25:22.320]   It's like private ABI.
[01:25:22.320 --> 01:25:24.120]   Yeah, absolutely for private APIs.
[01:25:24.120 --> 01:25:26.760]   But humans actually do run the apps and check for things.
[01:25:26.760 --> 01:25:29.200]   But this is stuff you would never ever find.
[01:25:29.200 --> 01:25:33.280]   And then they remotely, basically they create their own exploit, maybe a buffer overrun
[01:25:33.280 --> 01:25:34.280]   exploit.
[01:25:34.280 --> 01:25:38.160]   And they themselves trigger it and they do that several times and all those triggers
[01:25:38.160 --> 01:25:42.800]   combined together to make something that can do what other apps would get rejected for,
[01:25:42.800 --> 01:25:48.360]   like take your contact information or other things that can be violated within the sandbox
[01:25:48.360 --> 01:25:49.360]   of the app store.
[01:25:49.360 --> 01:25:50.360]   They stealthed it basically.
[01:25:50.360 --> 01:25:51.360]   Absolutely.
[01:25:51.360 --> 01:25:55.240]   I mean, this is a problem on every platform, but it's the same old story as Mac vulnerabilities.
[01:25:55.240 --> 01:26:00.320]   It's just that we're so used to being bulletproof that users wouldn't expect it and then it
[01:26:00.320 --> 01:26:03.800]   might be more of an emotional impact or more of a surprise for them.
[01:26:03.800 --> 01:26:09.680]   I guess what I would say is that, and I've said this for a long time, that Apple's promise
[01:26:09.680 --> 01:26:14.840]   that the app store is going to be clean is something that, especially as it grows, they
[01:26:14.840 --> 01:26:15.840]   just can't keep.
[01:26:15.840 --> 01:26:19.160]   I would say clean, but not clean.
[01:26:19.160 --> 01:26:21.840]   I don't think so, frankly.
[01:26:21.840 --> 01:26:27.760]   And I think it's a little bit of, it sets people up in a way that you still have to be
[01:26:27.760 --> 01:26:28.840]   careful.
[01:26:28.840 --> 01:26:32.760]   And there's no, you know, when you have, how many apps a day are submitted to thousands,
[01:26:32.760 --> 01:26:33.760]   right?
[01:26:33.760 --> 01:26:37.720]   There's so many people work in that department, but it's going to be very difficult and only
[01:26:37.720 --> 01:26:40.400]   going to get more difficult to spot this stuff.
[01:26:40.400 --> 01:26:43.880]   Apple says we have changed the policies to make it more secure, but they don't want
[01:26:43.880 --> 01:26:45.600]   to talk too deeply about it.
[01:26:45.600 --> 01:26:51.720]   Well, I think that it's just, there's a misapprehension that Apple is somehow protecting you.
[01:26:51.720 --> 01:26:53.000]   And this is very difficult to do.
[01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:54.160]   I don't think that they can.
[01:26:54.160 --> 01:26:57.280]   Well, they do it better than almost anybody else.
[01:26:57.280 --> 01:27:00.440]   And there are some simple things they could do to improve things.
[01:27:00.440 --> 01:27:05.480]   You're right, that it'd be so difficult to protect against this kind of a sneak.
[01:27:05.480 --> 01:27:11.280]   But what they could do is do something like have some form of download counts attached
[01:27:11.280 --> 01:27:17.440]   to that's visible to the public, because it becomes more of the burden is passed on
[01:27:17.440 --> 01:27:20.720]   to the consumer to figure out, is this an app I can trust.
[01:27:20.720 --> 01:27:24.960]   And if this version of this app has been downloaded a half a million times and there
[01:27:24.960 --> 01:27:29.560]   has not been an explosion of news about how this turned into malware, you're probably,
[01:27:29.560 --> 01:27:32.960]   maybe that's maybe another data point that you can trust this app.
[01:27:32.960 --> 01:27:34.800]   But yeah, I mean, nothing's going to be safe.
[01:27:34.800 --> 01:27:38.560]   If someone had certain illusions destroyed by this, then that's exactly the reason why
[01:27:38.560 --> 01:27:39.560]   they released this information.
[01:27:39.560 --> 01:27:40.560]   Right.
[01:27:40.560 --> 01:27:41.560]   And I do think I will.
[01:27:41.560 --> 01:27:43.560]   In my case, go ahead, Chris.
[01:27:43.560 --> 01:27:47.800]   Oh, I was just going to say in my case, I kind of do that and on my own by looking at
[01:27:47.800 --> 01:27:48.800]   reviews.
[01:27:48.800 --> 01:27:53.240]   And so if there are no reviews on something, generally I won't download it right away.
[01:27:53.240 --> 01:27:54.240]   I want to know.
[01:27:54.240 --> 01:27:57.040]   But now we know that that's another flaw in the Apple store that there are apps that
[01:27:57.040 --> 01:28:01.480]   are not that are being reviewed, but the reviews aren't showing up.
[01:28:01.480 --> 01:28:06.800]   And so there's a disadvantage for the independent developer.
[01:28:06.800 --> 01:28:07.800]   Right.
[01:28:07.800 --> 01:28:10.400]   And of course, it's not perfect when something's that big.
[01:28:10.400 --> 01:28:12.640]   It's not going to I'm not blaming Apple.
[01:28:12.640 --> 01:28:16.680]   I'm just saying you live in a fool's paradise if you think that somehow Apple is going to
[01:28:16.680 --> 01:28:17.680]   protect you.
[01:28:17.680 --> 01:28:21.480]   We're like little bambies though, because we don't we don't we don't we don't we're
[01:28:21.480 --> 01:28:24.600]   you know, as a Mac user, you're just not you don't think about it that much.
[01:28:24.600 --> 01:28:26.520]   You know, I think so be careful what you download.
[01:28:26.520 --> 01:28:29.560]   Think about what you download download stuff from big names.
[01:28:29.560 --> 01:28:32.560]   Look at reviews.
[01:28:32.560 --> 01:28:35.400]   Don't download, you know, crap where.
[01:28:35.400 --> 01:28:42.800]   And I believe also iOS seven you you consider switching off the auto update feature, at
[01:28:42.800 --> 01:28:44.040]   least for a while.
[01:28:44.040 --> 01:28:46.080]   That's an interesting point.
[01:28:46.080 --> 01:28:52.480]   Because I found apps, for example, the direct TV app, for example, was solid.
[01:28:52.480 --> 01:28:53.560]   Good version.
[01:28:53.560 --> 01:28:58.720]   The next version came out and apparently was bad that they had mostly updated it to include
[01:28:58.720 --> 01:29:03.680]   ad and had taken away a lot of functionality that you had to log in every single time you
[01:29:03.680 --> 01:29:05.040]   use the app.
[01:29:05.040 --> 01:29:07.920]   And so I would not have bothered to update that app and I haven't.
[01:29:07.920 --> 01:29:12.080]   However, if I'm using iOS seven and I have the option on to automatically update in the
[01:29:12.080 --> 01:29:13.680]   background, I'm screwed.
[01:29:13.680 --> 01:29:16.440]   I pick up my device and suddenly I've got that new version.
[01:29:16.440 --> 01:29:17.920]   It's not good.
[01:29:17.920 --> 01:29:21.720]   And then I have to think about rolling back and they don't provide you really way to get
[01:29:21.720 --> 01:29:22.920]   back to where you started.
[01:29:22.920 --> 01:29:28.400]   I almost never have auto update set to anything because I always want to see.
[01:29:28.400 --> 01:29:32.320]   Usually I'm a little behind and I'm quite fine being a little behind, you know, on one
[01:29:32.320 --> 01:29:33.320]   of the other updates.
[01:29:33.320 --> 01:29:36.880]   One thing I'd add though is I believe Apple said that in iOS seven, they've improved things
[01:29:36.880 --> 01:29:41.040]   like random address based allocation, which is part of the reason this works is because
[01:29:41.040 --> 01:29:45.200]   Apple's implementation of these things isn't perfect and it gets better in iOS seven.
[01:29:45.200 --> 01:29:48.280]   But the thing is still the social engineering attack because you still got to authorize
[01:29:48.280 --> 01:29:50.280]   or give them your stuff.
[01:29:50.280 --> 01:29:52.860]   And that's the hardest thing to protect against is, you know, will I share my
[01:29:52.860 --> 01:29:53.860]   contacts?
[01:29:53.860 --> 01:29:54.860]   Will I share my location?
[01:29:54.860 --> 01:29:56.680]   And that is probably just an education.
[01:29:56.680 --> 01:30:01.520]   I also get better at educating users about what they're doing.
[01:30:01.520 --> 01:30:02.720]   Let's take a break when we come back.
[01:30:02.720 --> 01:30:04.560]   Your picks your tips of the week.
[01:30:04.560 --> 01:30:09.340]   Renee Richie is here from imore.com Alex Lindsey from the Pixel core, the great Chris
[01:30:09.340 --> 01:30:18.000]   Breen from Mac 911 at Macworld.com and fine musician as well and Andy and not go from
[01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:20.440]   the Chicago, sometimes great panel.
[01:30:20.440 --> 01:30:26.260]   They are showed brought to you by legal zoom.com not a law firm.
[01:30:26.260 --> 01:30:28.700]   You don't need a law firm for some of the stuff that you want to do.
[01:30:28.700 --> 01:30:30.840]   You need to do to protect yourself.
[01:30:30.840 --> 01:30:34.060]   This is national make a will month, for example.
[01:30:34.060 --> 01:30:35.340]   You have kids or assets.
[01:30:35.340 --> 01:30:37.660]   You don't want the government to decide what happens to them.
[01:30:37.660 --> 01:30:41.980]   If you die without a will, you want to explain ahead of time.
[01:30:41.980 --> 01:30:45.020]   I know maybe some people don't want to think about this, but I admit legal zoom makes it
[01:30:45.020 --> 01:30:46.020]   so easy.
[01:30:46.020 --> 01:30:47.340]   You don't need to go to an attorney.
[01:30:47.340 --> 01:30:53.000]   You can make a will within, most people finish within 20 minutes.
[01:30:53.000 --> 01:30:57.880]   And because it's national make a will month, last wills are discounted 15% through the
[01:30:57.880 --> 01:30:58.880]   end of August.
[01:30:58.880 --> 01:31:03.680]   By the way, that's one of the reasons people don't do the wills, the last will thing.
[01:31:03.680 --> 01:31:06.280]   So that sounds kind of fatal.
[01:31:06.280 --> 01:31:09.520]   Well, you know, I'm going to make my last will in testament.
[01:31:09.520 --> 01:31:10.520]   What should we call this?
[01:31:10.520 --> 01:31:11.520]   We need a new name for this.
[01:31:11.520 --> 01:31:13.520]   Well, you know, my grandfather actually made, you know, made wills.
[01:31:13.520 --> 01:31:14.520]   He was a lawyer.
[01:31:14.520 --> 01:31:15.520]   He was a lawyer.
[01:31:15.520 --> 01:31:18.900]   You know, real estate and estates.
[01:31:18.900 --> 01:31:22.740]   And his will was definitely like a constant like he was updating it.
[01:31:22.740 --> 01:31:23.740]   I think so.
[01:31:23.740 --> 01:31:26.500]   That's why the last will you didn't want the previous will the penultimate will, but
[01:31:26.500 --> 01:31:28.660]   it was, but it was, it was constantly like, Oh, I'm going to add this.
[01:31:28.660 --> 01:31:29.660]   I bought something new.
[01:31:29.660 --> 01:31:32.180]   He would like manage it, you know, ongoing.
[01:31:32.180 --> 01:31:35.020]   I'm not saying you need to do that, but but it would, he just he kept it up to date all
[01:31:35.020 --> 01:31:36.020]   the time.
[01:31:36.020 --> 01:31:37.020]   Right.
[01:31:37.020 --> 01:31:38.020]   I never know.
[01:31:38.020 --> 01:31:40.820]   Well, easy to do on legal zoom and because they're discounting it, it's very affordable.
[01:31:40.820 --> 01:31:44.720]   That's where our LLC came from eight years ago.
[01:31:44.720 --> 01:31:45.720]   It still works.
[01:31:45.720 --> 01:31:50.920]   We're using incorporation as corporate seat, court trademark.
[01:31:50.920 --> 01:31:54.360]   Chad, as your trademark, did you file the, Chad did the trademark.
[01:31:54.360 --> 01:31:57.640]   I still need to send them a he's got to send this specimen.
[01:31:57.640 --> 01:31:58.640]   Yeah.
[01:31:58.640 --> 01:32:00.640]   Well, no wonder that doesn't sound like fun.
[01:32:00.640 --> 01:32:01.880]   Well, it's legal talk.
[01:32:01.880 --> 01:32:04.440]   I mean, that's the government talking not the government.
[01:32:04.440 --> 01:32:08.200]   What's a specimen legal zoom is the one that was like the government's asking for a
[01:32:08.200 --> 01:32:09.200]   specimen.
[01:32:09.200 --> 01:32:10.620]   Here's what you need to do.
[01:32:10.620 --> 01:32:11.820]   Some government filing stuff.
[01:32:11.820 --> 01:32:12.820]   They help you.
[01:32:12.820 --> 01:32:13.980]   They walk you through it.
[01:32:13.980 --> 01:32:18.180]   Last will, fortunately, no specimen or call.
[01:32:18.180 --> 01:32:23.680]   No, $69 normally 15% off right now if you and use our offer code MBW let them know you
[01:32:23.680 --> 01:32:24.680]   heard about it.
[01:32:24.680 --> 01:32:28.060]   Other services, $10 off when you use the offer code MBW.
[01:32:28.060 --> 01:32:30.780]   And if you do say, Hey, I'd like to ask an attorney some questions.
[01:32:30.780 --> 01:32:32.060]   They can do that too.
[01:32:32.060 --> 01:32:37.740]   Pre negotiated flat rate pricing from a attorney in your state, which is important.
[01:32:37.740 --> 01:32:41.100]   You can read the reviews unedited the profile so you know you're getting the attorney that
[01:32:41.100 --> 01:32:42.260]   will help you.
[01:32:42.260 --> 01:32:44.140]   I think legal zoom is such a boon.
[01:32:44.140 --> 01:32:45.140]   It's so important.
[01:32:45.140 --> 01:32:47.100]   There are other things you may have already done a will.
[01:32:47.100 --> 01:32:49.260]   Did you do a health care power of attorney yet?
[01:32:49.260 --> 01:32:51.500]   That's really important.
[01:32:51.500 --> 01:32:53.820]   Financial power of attorney living trusts.
[01:32:53.820 --> 01:32:58.020]   In fact, if you do a living trust right now, you'll get a pour over will absolutely free.
[01:32:58.020 --> 01:33:06.420]   Legal zoom.com offer code MBW time for our picks of the week.
[01:33:06.420 --> 01:33:08.020]   You like tower defense games.
[01:33:08.020 --> 01:33:09.740]   I love tower defense.
[01:33:09.740 --> 01:33:10.740]   Yeah.
[01:33:10.740 --> 01:33:12.460]   Have you played plants versus zombies too?
[01:33:12.460 --> 01:33:14.140]   It's about time yet.
[01:33:14.140 --> 01:33:16.700]   So I just downloaded it and I started playing with it.
[01:33:16.700 --> 01:33:18.780]   It's one of these like it's freemium.
[01:33:18.780 --> 01:33:19.780]   Yeah.
[01:33:19.780 --> 01:33:21.140]   And I was just like, I don't know if I'm going to do this.
[01:33:21.140 --> 01:33:22.140]   You know what?
[01:33:22.140 --> 01:33:25.140]   I have not spent a penny yet on it.
[01:33:25.140 --> 01:33:30.540]   And I think that congrag by the way, this was a pop cap game for in a and the great
[01:33:30.540 --> 01:33:32.420]   game for the iPad for years.
[01:33:32.420 --> 01:33:36.940]   Finally, we've waited for a long time for it to come out.
[01:33:36.940 --> 01:33:38.220]   Electronic Arts Bottom, right?
[01:33:38.220 --> 01:33:39.540]   The King of freemium.
[01:33:39.540 --> 01:33:44.940]   People who still owe me thousands of donuts as they crashed my Simpsons game and still
[01:33:44.940 --> 01:33:46.140]   haven't fixed it.
[01:33:46.140 --> 01:33:49.940]   So I almost didn't buy this, but I thought, well, I'm going to do it for you guys.
[01:33:49.940 --> 01:33:52.260]   It's free and I must see how far I can go.
[01:33:52.260 --> 01:33:55.460]   And I haven't had I've been played almost all the way through the Egypt level.
[01:33:55.460 --> 01:33:57.660]   So this you're going back in time now.
[01:33:57.660 --> 01:34:00.780]   It's very similar if you played the first play versus zombies, but there's some new stuff.
[01:34:00.780 --> 01:34:05.980]   For instance, this is the old game concentration, right?
[01:34:05.980 --> 01:34:10.340]   You flip a panel and then you match the panel to get rid of it.
[01:34:10.340 --> 01:34:13.460]   There's all sorts of new levels, which is kind of fun.
[01:34:13.460 --> 01:34:19.700]   It makes it very challenging because some of the strategies that you learned no longer
[01:34:19.700 --> 01:34:25.140]   work, yes, there are some ways to play that involve spending cash.
[01:34:25.140 --> 01:34:28.460]   In fact, let's stop it and go to the store here and I'll show you.
[01:34:28.460 --> 01:34:30.660]   You can spend some cash on this thing.
[01:34:30.660 --> 01:34:33.100]   But so far, my experience has been you don't have to.
[01:34:33.100 --> 01:34:34.620]   So that's the that's the good news.
[01:34:34.620 --> 01:34:40.220]   I think the best model that I've seen so far related to that has been actually another
[01:34:40.220 --> 01:34:44.380]   tower defense, which is field runners too, where I played for a good solid every home.
[01:34:44.380 --> 01:34:47.420]   I got three stars on almost every level before I ever spent penny.
[01:34:47.420 --> 01:34:49.340]   And then I started going, this is the same.
[01:34:49.340 --> 01:34:50.340]   This is the same.
[01:34:50.340 --> 01:34:53.980]   In fact, a lot of the money you spend will be more for nostalgia like buying plants that
[01:34:53.980 --> 01:34:56.180]   were in the old game, right?
[01:34:56.180 --> 01:35:01.500]   I don't think you really need the garlic or the squash, but the freezing, the freezing
[01:35:01.500 --> 01:35:03.060]   pea shooter, the snow pea.
[01:35:03.060 --> 01:35:04.060]   Snow pea.
[01:35:04.060 --> 01:35:05.060]   I haven't needed it yet.
[01:35:05.060 --> 01:35:06.580]   There's some other stuff, but I agree.
[01:35:06.580 --> 01:35:08.580]   The snow pea is a very useful.
[01:35:08.580 --> 01:35:12.140]   I know you were big plants versus zombies.
[01:35:12.140 --> 01:35:14.260]   There are some upgrades, but you can win some of these.
[01:35:14.260 --> 01:35:15.980]   In fact, I've won a couple of these already.
[01:35:15.980 --> 01:35:18.780]   Well, and that was the big thing with field runners that I really liked was that it was
[01:35:18.780 --> 01:35:21.180]   that you could get everything by just getting enough points.
[01:35:21.180 --> 01:35:22.500]   You weren't buying specific things.
[01:35:22.500 --> 01:35:23.500]   You're just buying points.
[01:35:23.500 --> 01:35:26.140]   You can't get everything without spending money on this, but you don't need it.
[01:35:26.140 --> 01:35:28.140]   You can get everything that you can buy.
[01:35:28.140 --> 01:35:29.140]   Yes.
[01:35:29.140 --> 01:35:30.780]   That's the main point.
[01:35:30.780 --> 01:35:35.220]   If we look at the map, you're going to see that there's ancient Egypt, pirate seas,
[01:35:35.220 --> 01:35:39.500]   wild west, you get to each one by completing enough stuff on each level.
[01:35:39.500 --> 01:35:41.700]   I think there's a third map.
[01:35:41.700 --> 01:35:45.020]   And they announced not daily, oh, the future is coming soon.
[01:35:45.020 --> 01:35:49.020]   In a way, I'm glad they did freemium because it gives them incentive to continue to update
[01:35:49.020 --> 01:35:52.420]   it like that.
[01:35:52.420 --> 01:35:55.860]   I think they did freemium right, which is you don't, I think as far as I can tell, you
[01:35:55.860 --> 01:35:57.900]   don't have to spend any money.
[01:35:57.900 --> 01:36:02.420]   In fact, somebody was writing that said that really it just gives you cheats if you spend
[01:36:02.420 --> 01:36:03.420]   money.
[01:36:03.420 --> 01:36:04.420]   Right.
[01:36:04.420 --> 01:36:09.580]   And in fact, those of us who are purists will never use cheats.
[01:36:09.580 --> 01:36:11.140]   I'm talking to you.
[01:36:11.140 --> 01:36:12.700]   So I love it.
[01:36:12.700 --> 01:36:15.380]   And I'm going to give it two thumbs up, Plants vs. Zombies 2.
[01:36:15.380 --> 01:36:18.420]   It's about time iOS only, iPad and iPhone.
[01:36:18.420 --> 01:36:19.420]   I just downloaded it.
[01:36:19.420 --> 01:36:20.420]   I haven't played it yet.
[01:36:20.420 --> 01:36:22.420]   I just started going through it and I was like, why am I have to buy all this stuff?
[01:36:22.420 --> 01:36:25.820]   I'm not a big fan of freemium, especially after losing, as I said, hundreds of dollars
[01:36:25.820 --> 01:36:28.620]   to those jerks at electronic arts.
[01:36:28.620 --> 01:36:30.420]   Yes, I'm talking to you.
[01:36:30.420 --> 01:36:32.620]   However, this time, I think you think they got it.
[01:36:32.620 --> 01:36:33.620]   I think it's OK.
[01:36:33.620 --> 01:36:34.620]   I think it's OK.
[01:36:34.620 --> 01:36:38.340]   Hey, Chris Breen, what's your pick of the week?
[01:36:38.340 --> 01:36:42.220]   My pick of the week is a little app I've been using for quite some time.
[01:36:42.220 --> 01:36:43.500]   It's called File Browser.
[01:36:43.500 --> 01:36:47.100]   It's from Stratospherics software.
[01:36:47.100 --> 01:36:49.020]   And it's a pretty simple app.
[01:36:49.020 --> 01:36:54.700]   The app is that it will allow you to browse the contents of any volumes or hard drives
[01:36:54.700 --> 01:36:57.100]   that are on your local network.
[01:36:57.100 --> 01:37:01.420]   So one of the problems we have with iOS devices is that you have a limited amount of space.
[01:37:01.420 --> 01:37:07.220]   Well, if I'm at home and I have an e-book library of, say, a thousand titles that I don't
[01:37:07.220 --> 01:37:13.220]   want to store on my device, I can simply put them in a folder somewhere on my Mac downstairs.
[01:37:13.220 --> 01:37:15.020]   I launch File Browser.
[01:37:15.020 --> 01:37:16.620]   I tap the Browse button.
[01:37:16.620 --> 01:37:19.300]   It shows me all the available volumes.
[01:37:19.300 --> 01:37:23.820]   And then I can get into any folders I like, download them directly to my iOS device.
[01:37:23.820 --> 01:37:28.380]   And if File Browser can't preview it itself and it can preview things like audio files
[01:37:28.380 --> 01:37:33.820]   and movies and image files, it allows me to use the OpenIn command.
[01:37:33.820 --> 01:37:38.860]   So if I have a, say, I've gone to Project Gutenberg and I have some ePub files or I
[01:37:38.860 --> 01:37:43.700]   have some Moby files, I can download them to my device and then I can open them either
[01:37:43.700 --> 01:37:47.020]   in the Kindle app or in the iBooks app.
[01:37:47.020 --> 01:37:53.500]   If I've found some free comics somewhere, I can use a comic book reader to do it there.
[01:37:53.500 --> 01:37:54.500]   Movie files.
[01:37:54.500 --> 01:37:59.020]   So instead of having to go to iCloud or some kind of online storage, I have local storage,
[01:37:59.020 --> 01:38:00.220]   which is faster.
[01:38:00.220 --> 01:38:06.380]   So I can grab a movie that I've put on my Mac somewhere, bring it on over to my iPad and
[01:38:06.380 --> 01:38:08.020]   be able to watch it right there.
[01:38:08.020 --> 01:38:13.180]   So it's kind of a simple utility, but one that I find that I use all the time and absolutely
[01:38:13.180 --> 01:38:14.740]   worth the five bucks.
[01:38:14.740 --> 01:38:15.740]   Excellent.
[01:38:15.740 --> 01:38:16.740]   Excellent.
[01:38:16.740 --> 01:38:19.340]   And it's on the Mac app store.
[01:38:19.340 --> 01:38:21.740]   No, this is actually an iOS.
[01:38:21.740 --> 01:38:22.740]   What am I saying?
[01:38:22.740 --> 01:38:23.740]   All right.
[01:38:23.740 --> 01:38:24.740]   Yeah.
[01:38:24.740 --> 01:38:26.580]   That makes sense.
[01:38:26.580 --> 01:38:27.580]   Thank you, Chris Breen.
[01:38:27.580 --> 01:38:32.180]   The hair of Breen can be seen at Macworld.com and on Twitter, there's the hair of Breen and
[01:38:32.180 --> 01:38:33.860]   the body of Breen.
[01:38:33.860 --> 01:38:34.860]   You don't do hair.
[01:38:34.860 --> 01:38:39.540]   And I will say, no, I don't do hair of Breen, but you know, I am also a Squarespace user.
[01:38:39.540 --> 01:38:45.660]   I recently launched a blog there at chrisbreen.com and it's mostly stories about my life as a
[01:38:45.660 --> 01:38:46.660]   musician.
[01:38:46.660 --> 01:38:47.660]   Oh, awesome.
[01:38:47.660 --> 01:38:50.420]   So I'll put another thumbs up for Squarespace.
[01:38:50.420 --> 01:38:51.420]   Awesome service.
[01:38:51.420 --> 01:38:54.140]   By the way, I like to I like the icon.
[01:38:54.140 --> 01:38:55.140]   It's your hair.
[01:38:55.140 --> 01:39:02.140]   It is rapidly becoming your your your your name, your your nomen, your your thing.
[01:39:02.140 --> 01:39:08.340]   Yeah, boy, if my hair falls out, I am so you won't have anything to show for it.
[01:39:08.340 --> 01:39:09.340]   Cool.
[01:39:09.340 --> 01:39:11.500]   Worst gig ever, July 1984.
[01:39:11.500 --> 01:39:14.220]   Oh, I got to read that one.
[01:39:14.220 --> 01:39:16.820]   Chris Breen's worst gig ever.
[01:39:16.820 --> 01:39:17.820]   Far out.
[01:39:17.820 --> 01:39:19.660]   And do you not go and sort that story?
[01:39:19.660 --> 01:39:20.660]   Really?
[01:39:20.660 --> 01:39:21.660]   Yes.
[01:39:21.660 --> 01:39:24.100]   Oh, yes, he has reviews of music.
[01:39:24.100 --> 01:39:30.500]   Any any Chris's music stories are pretty intense and pretty wonderful.
[01:39:30.500 --> 01:39:35.300]   It's I have I have been I have been the jerk at the party who has been likes or at the
[01:39:35.300 --> 01:39:36.300]   dinner table.
[01:39:36.300 --> 01:39:40.020]   I said, Chris, Chris, tell the story about the time you went to that enclave in the woods
[01:39:40.020 --> 01:39:42.300]   and you go play, play, play, play, play, tell that story.
[01:39:42.300 --> 01:39:46.860]   I'll tell half the story that yeah, exactly what Andy said except for was actually electric
[01:39:46.860 --> 01:39:47.860]   piano.
[01:39:47.860 --> 01:39:48.860]   Not a paper.
[01:39:48.860 --> 01:39:49.860]   Yeah.
[01:39:49.860 --> 01:39:50.860]   Oh, I just sent them a link.
[01:39:50.860 --> 01:39:53.940]   I said here you can read it now all online.
[01:39:53.940 --> 01:39:55.940]   This is awesome.
[01:39:55.940 --> 01:39:56.940]   This is awesome.
[01:39:56.940 --> 01:39:57.940]   I'm reading stuff.
[01:39:57.940 --> 01:39:58.940]   People say to musicians.
[01:39:58.940 --> 01:40:02.020]   This is great.
[01:40:02.020 --> 01:40:03.580]   Stop playing dance music.
[01:40:03.580 --> 01:40:06.940]   Scream by a mother of the bride is the band played take five the day.
[01:40:06.940 --> 01:40:10.060]   Rubik jazz classic or how about this one?
[01:40:10.060 --> 01:40:11.820]   Play the Brandenburg concerto.
[01:40:11.820 --> 01:40:12.820]   Which one?
[01:40:12.820 --> 01:40:14.620]   You know, there are six of them.
[01:40:14.620 --> 01:40:17.860]   You know the one and therefore chamber orchestra.
[01:40:17.860 --> 01:40:19.740]   I'm I'm playing a piano.
[01:40:19.740 --> 01:40:20.740]   You can do it.
[01:40:20.740 --> 01:40:21.740]   You know you can't know.
[01:40:21.740 --> 01:40:22.740]   I'm sorry.
[01:40:22.740 --> 01:40:23.740]   I can't.
[01:40:23.740 --> 01:40:24.740]   It's not a work for solo piano.
[01:40:24.740 --> 01:40:27.260]   I'm going to walk away now and I expect you to play it.
[01:40:27.260 --> 01:40:29.660]   And if you don't, I'll speak to your manager.
[01:40:29.660 --> 01:40:32.660]   So you played the piano at Neiman Marcus.
[01:40:32.660 --> 01:40:34.140]   That was my first gig in the city.
[01:40:34.140 --> 01:40:38.740]   I was the guy in the tuxedo up in the rotunda restaurant for three years.
[01:40:38.740 --> 01:40:41.300]   That actually I must have heard you.
[01:40:41.300 --> 01:40:42.300]   You probably did.
[01:40:42.300 --> 01:40:45.940]   I think everybody I tell that to said, Oh, I probably heard a guy.
[01:40:45.940 --> 01:40:46.940]   That was me.
[01:40:46.940 --> 01:40:49.020]   I was that guy.
[01:40:49.020 --> 01:40:50.900]   In the Brandenburg concerto.
[01:40:50.900 --> 01:40:54.780]   Can you play the 1812 Overture?
[01:40:54.780 --> 01:40:56.780]   I got that one too.
[01:40:56.780 --> 01:40:59.220]   I like the cannons and the bells.
[01:40:59.220 --> 01:41:00.220]   Yeah, right.
[01:41:00.220 --> 01:41:02.940]   You bring the cannon and I'll play it.
[01:41:02.940 --> 01:41:03.940]   Thanks.
[01:41:03.940 --> 01:41:05.380]   Thanks to Chris.
[01:41:05.380 --> 01:41:07.100]   I know what a PSO is.
[01:41:07.100 --> 01:41:08.100]   What's that?
[01:41:08.100 --> 01:41:13.460]   Hey, refer to if I'm a correct heel correct if I'm wrong, but it refers to like when you
[01:41:13.460 --> 01:41:17.100]   the piano player and you show up at a venue and they've told you to have a piano ready.
[01:41:17.100 --> 01:41:18.100]   It's not actually a piano.
[01:41:18.100 --> 01:41:20.740]   It's just a piano shaped object.
[01:41:20.740 --> 01:41:24.300]   Love it.
[01:41:24.300 --> 01:41:25.300]   This is great.
[01:41:25.300 --> 01:41:26.860]   Hairbrained ideas.
[01:41:26.860 --> 01:41:28.380]   It's at Chrisbrained.com.
[01:41:28.380 --> 01:41:31.460]   Chris, I'm so glad you're doing this.
[01:41:31.460 --> 01:41:32.460]   I am too.
[01:41:32.460 --> 01:41:36.100]   I was actually motivated to do it because I've been writing for the magazine app, which Glenn
[01:41:36.100 --> 01:41:37.540]   Fleischman is now running.
[01:41:37.540 --> 01:41:42.220]   And it's been a fun opportunity to write about something other than tech.
[01:41:42.220 --> 01:41:43.300]   And I do have a lot of stories.
[01:41:43.300 --> 01:41:48.820]   My last one is actually sobering, but it's about the AIDS epidemic of the 80s because
[01:41:48.820 --> 01:41:52.180]   a lot of the people I worked with were victims of that.
[01:41:52.180 --> 01:41:55.940]   And so that's a story I've been wanting to tell for a long time, but wasn't sure how
[01:41:55.940 --> 01:41:56.940]   to do it.
[01:41:56.940 --> 01:41:58.780]   So that was the place to do it.
[01:41:58.780 --> 01:42:03.740]   You know, yeah, any of us who worked at San Francisco in the 80s and early 90s really saw
[01:42:03.740 --> 01:42:08.580]   what a swath, that disease cut.
[01:42:08.580 --> 01:42:09.580]   And it was just...
[01:42:09.580 --> 01:42:11.820]   Yeah, well, I've totally bummed the show out now.
[01:42:11.820 --> 01:42:14.140]   So thanks so much, Chris, for bringing us up.
[01:42:14.140 --> 01:42:15.460]   No, Chrisbrained.com.
[01:42:15.460 --> 01:42:17.620]   I'm so glad you're doing this.
[01:42:17.620 --> 01:42:20.140]   Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra or piano shaped object.
[01:42:20.140 --> 01:42:21.140]   Right.
[01:42:21.140 --> 01:42:22.140]   Since Patterson.
[01:42:22.140 --> 01:42:23.140]   Right.
[01:42:23.140 --> 01:42:24.140]   Mr. Andy Inaco.
[01:42:24.140 --> 01:42:26.140]   What's your pick of the week, sir?
[01:42:26.140 --> 01:42:27.860]   I've got a kind of unusual one.
[01:42:27.860 --> 01:42:32.020]   Before I forget, because I know I'll forget at the end, I'm doing like a special Skype
[01:42:32.020 --> 01:42:38.020]   talk at a user group tonight, the Sacramento MacNexas group.
[01:42:38.020 --> 01:42:41.020]   So if you are a member of that group or if you would like to be a member of that group,
[01:42:41.020 --> 01:42:42.020]   slide on by...
[01:42:42.020 --> 01:42:46.300]   I've spoken to them in person once or twice before by Skype, once before, this sort of
[01:42:46.300 --> 01:42:47.660]   a last minute thing.
[01:42:47.660 --> 01:42:52.140]   So after this show, I will spend the next three hours working out, okay, what am I going
[01:42:52.140 --> 01:42:53.140]   to talk about again?
[01:42:53.140 --> 01:42:54.140]   Oh, okay.
[01:42:54.140 --> 01:42:55.140]   Interesting times.
[01:42:55.140 --> 01:42:57.100]   I'm sure wonderful things to talk about.
[01:42:57.100 --> 01:42:59.540]   So I just want to make sure that their site is MacNexas.com.
[01:42:59.540 --> 01:43:02.180]   And you're doing that via Skype.
[01:43:02.180 --> 01:43:03.180]   That's cool.
[01:43:03.180 --> 01:43:04.180]   I'm doing that via Skype.
[01:43:04.180 --> 01:43:09.820]   Yes, saves on wear and tear on the security patdowns.
[01:43:09.820 --> 01:43:10.820]   We should say that we are...
[01:43:10.820 --> 01:43:13.220]   I'm sorry, it's MacNexas.org for information.
[01:43:13.220 --> 01:43:16.500]   We are flying Andy out, I think, for...
[01:43:16.500 --> 01:43:20.580]   Should you get an invitation for September 10th, and I believe you will, I believe we
[01:43:20.580 --> 01:43:23.340]   will be flying you out to the beautiful San Francisco.
[01:43:23.340 --> 01:43:24.340]   Exactly.
[01:43:24.340 --> 01:43:29.820]   And I will be handing out postcards and leaflets, albeit in even Marcus, playing the Kazoo and
[01:43:29.820 --> 01:43:33.100]   Slide Whistle to the annoyance of people who will pay me to stop doing that.
[01:43:33.100 --> 01:43:36.300]   Actually, you can put the Brandenburg-Kachetto on the Kazoo and Slide Whistle.
[01:43:36.300 --> 01:43:37.300]   It's a little not bad.
[01:43:37.300 --> 01:43:38.300]   Exactly right.
[01:43:38.300 --> 01:43:39.300]   It's just that easy.
[01:43:39.300 --> 01:43:41.300]   One flute needs to be each nostril.
[01:43:41.300 --> 01:43:43.740]   That's how you get to harm these states.
[01:43:43.740 --> 01:43:44.980]   It's a professional tip.
[01:43:44.980 --> 01:43:49.700]   And not the weirdest thing a San Francisco musician will have done in that vicinity in
[01:43:49.700 --> 01:43:50.700]   quite some time.
[01:43:50.700 --> 01:43:51.700]   No.
[01:43:51.700 --> 01:43:53.020]   My pick is something unusual.
[01:43:53.020 --> 01:43:56.220]   It's actually sort of a last minute thing because I suddenly remember that sometimes we
[01:43:56.220 --> 01:43:59.900]   pick things that are not necessarily tech related, but just things that we absolutely
[01:43:59.900 --> 01:44:01.200]   love.
[01:44:01.200 --> 01:44:07.860]   This is a graphic novel by Lucy Knisley called "Relish My Life in the Kitchen" that I absolutely
[01:44:07.860 --> 01:44:08.940]   love.
[01:44:08.940 --> 01:44:15.220]   She's a wonderful cartoonist and it's sort of, it's autobiographical in nature, but it is
[01:44:15.220 --> 01:44:21.460]   all about her relationship with food as the daughter of a professional catering chef and
[01:44:21.460 --> 01:44:27.500]   a father who is just a magnificent foodie in his own right, who just grew up to appreciate
[01:44:27.500 --> 01:44:28.820]   great, great food.
[01:44:28.820 --> 01:44:32.860]   But also being a kid, realizing that, "Well, if mom and dad want me to eat this great stuff,
[01:44:32.860 --> 01:44:37.260]   I'm also going to appreciate McDonald's food and sugar straws."
[01:44:37.260 --> 01:44:44.340]   And wonderfully told, this is essentially a couple hundred pages of someone explaining
[01:44:44.340 --> 01:44:50.060]   to you why they love a certain thing and doing it with beauty style, grace, entertainment
[01:44:50.060 --> 01:44:51.340]   and elegance.
[01:44:51.340 --> 01:44:56.100]   And because she's not a professional chef, she is a professional cartoonist.
[01:44:56.100 --> 01:45:01.700]   She sometimes will include actual like visual cartoon style recipes on how to make certain
[01:45:01.700 --> 01:45:05.140]   of her favorite things or her family's favorite things.
[01:45:05.140 --> 01:45:07.740]   And so it's just a magnificent book.
[01:45:07.740 --> 01:45:12.420]   I've reread it several times and I'm going to give you a tip.
[01:45:12.420 --> 01:45:13.740]   It is available on the Kindle store.
[01:45:13.740 --> 01:45:18.580]   It is available on the iBook store by the actual paperback.
[01:45:18.580 --> 01:45:23.140]   And this will serve both as a warning and as an indication of how much I love this book.
[01:45:23.140 --> 01:45:31.420]   The first time I read it, I actually read the Kindle edition because you buy everything
[01:45:31.420 --> 01:45:32.420]   on Kindle.
[01:45:32.420 --> 01:45:33.820]   Hello, there you go.
[01:45:33.820 --> 01:45:41.220]   And so you think it's unfortunately the publisher of this book don't understand how comics work.
[01:45:41.220 --> 01:45:45.340]   So all you can do is see these two page spreads left and right.
[01:45:45.340 --> 01:45:48.740]   If you tilt it like this, nothing happens.
[01:45:48.740 --> 01:45:50.980]   And so that's about as big as you can see it.
[01:45:50.980 --> 01:45:54.500]   So what I wound up, but I got so frustrated and I was reading, I was reading, rereading
[01:45:54.500 --> 01:46:00.100]   this so many times that what I actually did was I screenshot the entire book and converted
[01:46:00.100 --> 01:46:06.220]   it into an open cbz file just so that I could read it as I feel God intended.
[01:46:06.220 --> 01:46:07.220]   This is this is wonderful.
[01:46:07.220 --> 01:46:11.780]   This is the story of traveling in youth hostels with a friend of hers as a kid and discovering
[01:46:11.780 --> 01:46:18.620]   these croissants that got her so upset that trying to a several pages describing the experience
[01:46:18.620 --> 01:46:20.140]   of these croissants.
[01:46:20.140 --> 01:46:24.380]   And then later on describing, getting back to art school, deciding getting getting so
[01:46:24.380 --> 01:46:28.460]   obsessed with it that she's obsessed with trying to figure out how to make these croissants
[01:46:28.460 --> 01:46:33.740]   and making tray after tray of failed croissants and eating nothing but pastry for days because
[01:46:33.740 --> 01:46:35.380]   she gets so obsessed with it.
[01:46:35.380 --> 01:46:40.420]   So again, I will just go to the grown up and it's all over.
[01:46:40.420 --> 01:46:42.620]   I'm sure you appreciate it.
[01:46:42.620 --> 01:46:45.100]   So I shouldn't speak out of turn.
[01:46:45.100 --> 01:46:49.180]   I don't know whether maybe it was the artist decision that I don't want people to see full
[01:46:49.180 --> 01:46:50.180]   screen.
[01:46:50.180 --> 01:46:53.300]   I wanted to see this book as two page spreads at all times.
[01:46:53.300 --> 01:46:57.260]   I found it easier to read like this and therefore that's why I'm recommending by the actual
[01:46:57.260 --> 01:47:01.100]   book instead of the Kindle or the iBooks edition.
[01:47:01.100 --> 01:47:07.140]   Unless you want to screenshot all 180 pages and then run a command line script to convert
[01:47:07.140 --> 01:47:11.140]   them into left and right pages and then convert them into a CBR file.
[01:47:11.140 --> 01:47:14.700]   It was two hours worth of work but it was definitely worth it because it's such a good
[01:47:14.700 --> 01:47:15.700]   book.
[01:47:15.700 --> 01:47:16.700]   Relish.
[01:47:16.700 --> 01:47:17.700]   It makes me hungry.
[01:47:17.700 --> 01:47:18.700]   Just think of it.
[01:47:18.700 --> 01:47:19.700]   I actually had to go.
[01:47:19.700 --> 01:47:27.220]   I was like a day after I read this I was I sound like just to do like some work.
[01:47:27.220 --> 01:47:30.020]   Because it's a place to go out and it's open very very late.
[01:47:30.020 --> 01:47:34.020]   And for some reason I found myself even ordering one of those like nasty like Dunkin Donuts
[01:47:34.020 --> 01:47:38.660]   croissants because I just need to have a croissant.
[01:47:38.660 --> 01:47:39.660]   Croissant.
[01:47:39.660 --> 01:47:43.100]   Rene, Rich, you had a tweet up there for a while.
[01:47:43.100 --> 01:47:44.700]   We never did ask you about that.
[01:47:44.700 --> 01:47:46.220]   It looked like a CNET tweet.
[01:47:46.220 --> 01:47:47.220]   Was there a reason?
[01:47:47.220 --> 01:47:48.220]   No, I didn't.
[01:47:48.220 --> 01:47:52.700]   I was clicking something because someone sent it to me and it opened up behind me by accident.
[01:47:52.700 --> 01:47:53.700]   Oh, okay.
[01:47:53.700 --> 01:47:54.700]   I didn't realize where the window was.
[01:47:54.700 --> 01:47:55.900]   I thought my whole computer was screwed up.
[01:47:55.900 --> 01:47:56.900]   It was very confused.
[01:47:56.900 --> 01:47:57.900]   It has a giant screen.
[01:47:57.900 --> 01:48:01.340]   By the way, are you guys in competition because your screen seems bigger than Andy's?
[01:48:01.340 --> 01:48:02.660]   No, I messed up.
[01:48:02.660 --> 01:48:06.380]   His screen is much better for what we're doing.
[01:48:06.380 --> 01:48:07.380]   I just.
[01:48:07.380 --> 01:48:08.940]   Oh, come now.
[01:48:08.940 --> 01:48:11.620]   Mine is partially walled now partially.
[01:48:11.620 --> 01:48:12.620]   You're huge.
[01:48:12.620 --> 01:48:14.260]   Monday you're going to lean back and your chair.
[01:48:14.260 --> 01:48:15.260]   That thing's going to kill you.
[01:48:15.260 --> 01:48:16.260]   That's what I mean.
[01:48:16.260 --> 01:48:18.980]   Every time you see that it's like, okay, that's a problem.
[01:48:18.980 --> 01:48:20.780]   He has a squirrel on the top of it.
[01:48:20.780 --> 01:48:21.980]   You just can't see it.
[01:48:21.980 --> 01:48:22.980]   That's the absolute.
[01:48:22.980 --> 01:48:23.980]   Yeah.
[01:48:23.980 --> 01:48:25.180]   So what is your pick, Rene?
[01:48:25.180 --> 01:48:28.260]   My pick, it just came out a couple hours before the show actually.
[01:48:28.260 --> 01:48:29.500]   It's hype 2.0.
[01:48:29.500 --> 01:48:33.740]   Now back before I was a blogger, I worked in enterprise software and I did a lot of web
[01:48:33.740 --> 01:48:39.300]   development and I used a lot of flash, especially flash animation to create interactive websites
[01:48:39.300 --> 01:48:40.300]   when those were all the rage.
[01:48:40.300 --> 01:48:41.340]   And this was a decade ago.
[01:48:41.340 --> 01:48:42.340]   Oh, okay.
[01:48:42.340 --> 01:48:43.340]   So my childhood indiscretion.
[01:48:43.340 --> 01:48:44.340]   You were young.
[01:48:44.340 --> 01:48:45.340]   You needed the money.
[01:48:45.340 --> 01:48:46.340]   I understand.
[01:48:46.340 --> 01:48:47.340]   I was absolutely.
[01:48:47.340 --> 01:48:48.340]   I was foolish.
[01:48:48.340 --> 01:48:51.940]   But you know, for a while, just like Act of X, it was the only way to do certain things
[01:48:51.940 --> 01:48:52.940]   on the web.
[01:48:52.940 --> 01:48:54.340]   It plugged a hole.
[01:48:54.340 --> 01:48:59.300]   And while flash video was, flash video has been replaced in some to some degree by HTML
[01:48:59.300 --> 01:49:03.620]   5 video, the same is not true of traditional key frame animation.
[01:49:03.620 --> 01:49:04.980]   And that was my background.
[01:49:04.980 --> 01:49:05.980]   And I always loved that.
[01:49:05.980 --> 01:49:08.620]   And a lot of people still use flash for that.
[01:49:08.620 --> 01:49:12.660]   Now hype is by a couple of people who used to work at Apple and they put it together.
[01:49:12.660 --> 01:49:18.140]   It's got a key line editor and it lets you create objects, put those objects along motion
[01:49:18.140 --> 01:49:24.940]   and create animations and interactivity and then export it into an HTML file.
[01:49:24.940 --> 01:49:28.820]   Basically some web code and a folder full of resources.
[01:49:28.820 --> 01:49:33.660]   And you could do a lot of the stuff that I used to do in flash MX, whatever it was.
[01:49:33.660 --> 01:49:38.100]   You know, spinning logos and the new version now has touch controls.
[01:49:38.100 --> 01:49:39.980]   It has curved paths.
[01:49:39.980 --> 01:49:46.700]   And it has a companion app on iOS called reflect, hype reflect, which you put on your iPad or
[01:49:46.700 --> 01:49:50.940]   iPhone, put it next to you and you can live preview the stuff that you're building, try
[01:49:50.940 --> 01:49:53.100]   the gesture controls.
[01:49:53.100 --> 01:49:57.140]   And it produces really good quality output.
[01:49:57.140 --> 01:50:00.940]   It can't do everything that flash could do even a decade ago.
[01:50:00.940 --> 01:50:03.180]   It doesn't have everything that flash had in it.
[01:50:03.180 --> 01:50:08.360]   But for things like creating those dynamic web animations or timeline based things or
[01:50:08.360 --> 01:50:14.580]   even more advanced touch controls than basic HTML allows, it's really fantastic.
[01:50:14.580 --> 01:50:15.740]   It's integrated.
[01:50:15.740 --> 01:50:19.940]   It's on sale for 50% off now because the Mac App Store doesn't allow upgrades.
[01:50:19.940 --> 01:50:22.300]   So you have to do the upgrade for everybody.
[01:50:22.300 --> 01:50:27.060]   So I believe it's 30 bucks right now and the iOS companion app is free.
[01:50:27.060 --> 01:50:30.660]   And when I knew I was going to like it is that I immediately wanted to start building
[01:50:30.660 --> 01:50:31.980]   animations in it.
[01:50:31.980 --> 01:50:36.180]   I wanted to do all those little character things you still do in flash so well.
[01:50:36.180 --> 01:50:41.660]   So I thought this is like the coming of age of HTML 5 tools for interactive animation.
[01:50:41.660 --> 01:50:43.380]   Wow.
[01:50:43.380 --> 01:50:44.420]   Pretty cool.
[01:50:44.420 --> 01:50:47.820]   From Tumult to UMELT, it's in the App Store.
[01:50:47.820 --> 01:50:49.620]   Hi, how much is it?
[01:50:49.620 --> 01:50:53.260]   I believe it's on sale now for 30 bucks until September 10th and then it will go back to
[01:50:53.260 --> 01:50:55.260]   its normal price of around 60 bucks.
[01:50:55.260 --> 01:50:56.780]   So now's the time to get it.
[01:50:56.780 --> 01:50:57.780]   Yeah.
[01:50:57.780 --> 01:50:58.940]   And that's basically the thing you're showing there.
[01:50:58.940 --> 01:51:00.260]   That timeline animation is one thing.
[01:51:00.260 --> 01:51:01.700]   It's just so easy to make stuff in this.
[01:51:01.700 --> 01:51:03.100]   It's crazy.
[01:51:03.100 --> 01:51:05.580]   It would only be useful if you're making websites, right?
[01:51:05.580 --> 01:51:06.580]   Yeah.
[01:51:06.580 --> 01:51:07.820]   Unless you want to make little localize.
[01:51:07.820 --> 01:51:12.620]   A lot of people used flash not just to make websites but to do designs for games that
[01:51:12.620 --> 01:51:16.020]   they wanted to build or zombies was a flash game, I think.
[01:51:16.020 --> 01:51:17.020]   Absolutely.
[01:51:17.020 --> 01:51:21.620]   And some people made little television animation style stuff in this.
[01:51:21.620 --> 01:51:25.500]   And this is even for as much as it can't do everything flash could do.
[01:51:25.500 --> 01:51:26.780]   It's so much more accessible.
[01:51:26.780 --> 01:51:30.140]   If you could do a build in PowerPoint or in keynote, you can start building animation
[01:51:30.140 --> 01:51:31.140]   right in this.
[01:51:31.140 --> 01:51:32.140]   Yeah.
[01:51:32.140 --> 01:51:33.140]   Very cool.
[01:51:33.140 --> 01:51:34.900]   Alex Lindsey, your pick of the week.
[01:51:34.900 --> 01:51:36.900]   So not the snappy.
[01:51:36.900 --> 01:51:37.900]   Yeah.
[01:51:37.900 --> 01:51:41.180]   Not the same snappy is the one I was thinking of.
[01:51:41.180 --> 01:51:43.180]   With the parallel port camera attachment?
[01:51:43.180 --> 01:51:44.420]   I don't remember that.
[01:51:44.420 --> 01:51:45.420]   No.
[01:51:45.420 --> 01:51:46.420]   You're not missing anything.
[01:51:46.420 --> 01:51:48.420]   No, this is this is this is.
[01:51:48.420 --> 01:51:50.580]   So a lot of times, you know, you want to get like an animate.
[01:51:50.580 --> 01:51:53.460]   You want to build an animated GIF or you want to shoot a whole bunch of photos all at one
[01:51:53.460 --> 01:51:54.460]   time.
[01:51:54.460 --> 01:52:00.380]   And of course, the camera is a little too slow on the on your iPhone.
[01:52:00.380 --> 01:52:05.220]   This is a cool little app called snappy cam and I think Ted Price, I think from our company
[01:52:05.220 --> 01:52:10.380]   is recommended that I that I check it out and it'll do 60 photos a second.
[01:52:10.380 --> 01:52:11.380]   And so it basically.
[01:52:11.380 --> 01:52:12.380]   Yeah.
[01:52:12.380 --> 01:52:13.860]   And so it's like it's shooting a movie, really.
[01:52:13.860 --> 01:52:14.860]   Yeah.
[01:52:14.860 --> 01:52:15.860]   And this is for the iPhone.
[01:52:15.860 --> 01:52:16.860]   Yeah, this is for the iPhone.
[01:52:16.860 --> 01:52:22.100]   And I think I have an example here of my of my kids.
[01:52:22.100 --> 01:52:24.620]   So you can see like this was how are we going to play this?
[01:52:24.620 --> 01:52:25.620]   Just roll it.
[01:52:25.620 --> 01:52:27.980]   Just roll your finger over the over the just show it.
[01:52:27.980 --> 01:52:30.260]   So can you get you have you over the shoulder, Mr.
[01:52:30.260 --> 01:52:31.900]   Just roll.
[01:52:31.900 --> 01:52:34.540]   So I go like roll over the roll over this.
[01:52:34.540 --> 01:52:36.300]   Yeah, that just click on that.
[01:52:36.300 --> 01:52:37.300]   There we go.
[01:52:37.300 --> 01:52:38.300]   Oh, neat.
[01:52:38.300 --> 01:52:40.300]   So that was so it's like you're shooting a movie, but you got.
[01:52:40.300 --> 01:52:41.300]   All the individual images.
[01:52:41.300 --> 01:52:42.300]   Yeah.
[01:52:42.300 --> 01:52:45.460]   And I haven't gone through them to look at the resolution, but but the point is is that
[01:52:45.460 --> 01:52:46.820]   you can get all these images really quickly.
[01:52:46.820 --> 01:52:49.220]   You're not trying to, you know, if you shot video, then you had to figure out how to get
[01:52:49.220 --> 01:52:50.220]   them out.
[01:52:50.220 --> 01:52:51.220]   Then what do you do?
[01:52:51.220 --> 01:52:52.220]   Well, I mean, you can export it like that.
[01:52:52.220 --> 01:52:53.220]   I'm going to turn into a GIF.
[01:52:53.220 --> 01:52:54.220]   I think it would be kind of funny.
[01:52:54.220 --> 01:52:55.220]   An animated GIF.
[01:52:55.220 --> 01:52:57.820]   Yeah, but I was just having, you know, this was just me playing with it.
[01:52:57.820 --> 01:53:00.660]   It was just like you just hold down the button and it just.
[01:53:00.660 --> 01:53:02.820]   Street, you know, streams out a whole lot of photos.
[01:53:02.820 --> 01:53:06.740]   So, you know, so it's that shows you how much power is in the iPhone camera that is
[01:53:06.740 --> 01:53:08.940]   tapped by the iPhone camera app.
[01:53:08.940 --> 01:53:10.940]   Yeah, and so it's a cool little app.
[01:53:10.940 --> 01:53:13.660]   You know, it's I think it's like, you know, I think it's a buck 90.
[01:53:13.660 --> 01:53:16.020]   It's on the iPhone app store.
[01:53:16.020 --> 01:53:18.900]   Would it work with, I guess it would work with an iPad, even if they don't have an iPad
[01:53:18.900 --> 01:53:19.900]   version.
[01:53:19.900 --> 01:53:20.900]   Yeah.
[01:53:20.900 --> 01:53:21.900]   They have a so you use it.
[01:53:21.900 --> 01:53:22.900]   But you're not going to use it.
[01:53:22.900 --> 01:53:27.180]   I can't imagine myself using it with the with the with the iPad, but it's cool.
[01:53:27.180 --> 01:53:32.900]   But it's you could shoot for three or one one or 16 nine right infinite shooting high
[01:53:32.900 --> 01:53:39.940]   speed continuous shooting, six X zoom, incredible 60 sec photos per second or time lapse down
[01:53:39.940 --> 01:53:40.940]   to one.
[01:53:40.940 --> 01:53:41.940]   Oh, it does time lapse.
[01:53:41.940 --> 01:53:43.500]   I haven't tried the time.
[01:53:43.500 --> 01:53:45.340]   I like that.
[01:53:45.340 --> 01:53:46.340]   Time lapse is fun.
[01:53:46.340 --> 01:53:47.340]   Yeah.
[01:53:47.340 --> 01:53:48.340]   Yeah.
[01:53:48.340 --> 01:53:49.340]   I like time lapse.
[01:53:49.340 --> 01:53:52.100]   It's called snappy cam and it's in the app store.
[01:53:52.100 --> 01:53:55.340]   And that concludes this edition of back break weekly.
[01:53:55.340 --> 01:53:56.740]   Alex Lindsey nice to have you back.
[01:53:56.740 --> 01:53:58.860]   Hey, Judy, I have something special for folks.
[01:53:58.860 --> 01:53:59.860]   Okay.
[01:53:59.860 --> 01:54:00.860]   You mentioned it.
[01:54:00.860 --> 01:54:03.660]   I don't really get to talk about what I do very often.
[01:54:03.660 --> 01:54:07.100]   You finally, you gave us a peek under the kill.
[01:54:07.100 --> 01:54:08.100]   Yeah.
[01:54:08.100 --> 01:54:10.780]   So I'm there's a couple of them that I'm doing right now that that I can actually show people.
[01:54:10.780 --> 01:54:17.940]   So if you go up to my my G plus thing, I think I I wrote a we're in media.
[01:54:17.940 --> 01:54:22.020]   A lot of me it's about hangouts all the time and I give all these you've become the expert
[01:54:22.020 --> 01:54:23.020]   in how to do hangout.
[01:54:23.020 --> 01:54:27.260]   I've done a lot of them, but I had a here's there's one thing that there's tips for hangouts
[01:54:27.260 --> 01:54:28.660]   on air.
[01:54:28.660 --> 01:54:29.860]   And that was been pretty popular.
[01:54:29.860 --> 01:54:33.700]   But anyway, so that's all the tips that I give every time I am in everything you know.
[01:54:33.700 --> 01:54:36.580]   Well, it's not everything I know, but it's definitely what I say in every meeting.
[01:54:36.580 --> 01:54:39.660]   Like this is the stuff that you want to think about, but more importantly that this one right
[01:54:39.660 --> 01:54:41.500]   next to it here this.
[01:54:41.500 --> 01:54:44.660]   So I don't get to show what we do very often, but a lot of times we do some pretty complex
[01:54:44.660 --> 01:54:47.620]   hangouts and so I shot I put some behind the scenes.
[01:54:47.620 --> 01:54:48.620]   So it's for discovery for sure.
[01:54:48.620 --> 01:54:49.860]   For discovery channel for sure.
[01:54:49.860 --> 01:54:50.860]   Yeah.
[01:54:50.860 --> 01:54:54.340]   And so and yeah, it was kind of.
[01:54:54.340 --> 01:54:57.540]   If you want to know how the pros do it.
[01:54:57.540 --> 01:54:59.820]   Well, this is like insane.
[01:54:59.820 --> 01:55:02.140]   It's not like a hangout with your webcam.
[01:55:02.140 --> 01:55:03.140]   You know, so we had a.
[01:55:03.140 --> 01:55:08.340]   Now, where is the where's the this is the Baltimore aquarium, but do you have any informations
[01:55:08.340 --> 01:55:10.700]   about how you know we talk about how we did that.
[01:55:10.700 --> 01:55:11.700]   We just look at it.
[01:55:11.700 --> 01:55:12.700]   Yeah.
[01:55:12.700 --> 01:55:16.260]   So I the other post that I put up on G plus was how to how to think about these things.
[01:55:16.260 --> 01:55:19.180]   This was just most people who have done some production.
[01:55:19.180 --> 01:55:23.060]   There's our hydra flicks, which was the not ours.
[01:55:23.060 --> 01:55:24.060]   We rented that.
[01:55:24.060 --> 01:55:27.500]   But that's a that's an epic red epic inside of a that's inside of that.
[01:55:27.500 --> 01:55:32.140]   The hydra flicks to complete remote control underwater camera because the hangout was
[01:55:32.140 --> 01:55:33.140]   underwater.
[01:55:33.140 --> 01:55:34.380]   Hangout was for those who didn't see it.
[01:55:34.380 --> 01:55:35.380]   Yeah.
[01:55:35.380 --> 01:55:39.860]   So with the sharks and we had to use a remote camera because the sharks were new and we
[01:55:39.860 --> 01:55:45.020]   were concerned that they would they weren't trained yet not to eat the divers and so turned
[01:55:45.020 --> 01:55:47.820]   out that we had to actually train sharks not to eat divers.
[01:55:47.820 --> 01:55:50.340]   I've been they just get used to them and they just realize they're not very tasty.
[01:55:50.340 --> 01:55:53.820]   You know, it's you know, there's there's the there's the hydra flicks underneath the
[01:55:53.820 --> 01:55:56.100]   underneath the water.
[01:55:56.100 --> 01:55:59.980]   So so anyway, so I don't get to show that very often.
[01:55:59.980 --> 01:56:03.420]   We've got one coming up this Friday.
[01:56:03.420 --> 01:56:04.900]   We kind of do a lot of extreme stuff.
[01:56:04.900 --> 01:56:06.900]   So so this was underwater on Friday.
[01:56:06.900 --> 01:56:10.620]   We're doing one with Formula one.
[01:56:10.620 --> 01:56:11.620]   How fun.
[01:56:11.620 --> 01:56:12.620]   Yeah.
[01:56:12.620 --> 01:56:13.620]   Yeah.
[01:56:13.620 --> 01:56:16.100]   So you actually had to figure out how to do the hangout under underwater.
[01:56:16.100 --> 01:56:17.100]   Yeah.
[01:56:17.100 --> 01:56:18.860]   And now you're going to do it what in a car?
[01:56:18.860 --> 01:56:19.860]   Yeah.
[01:56:19.860 --> 01:56:24.700]   While he's driving, someone's going to be in the back in the backseat of the two seater
[01:56:24.700 --> 01:56:26.460]   back seats in Formula one.
[01:56:26.460 --> 01:56:27.460]   They're trainers.
[01:56:27.460 --> 01:56:28.460]   Oh.
[01:56:28.460 --> 01:56:32.660]   And so so that's the that's the that'll be on Friday morning.
[01:56:32.660 --> 01:56:33.660]   So keep your eye on.
[01:56:33.660 --> 01:56:38.100]   You know, it's fun for me because I see what I see you doing stuff in the basement.
[01:56:38.100 --> 01:56:39.580]   I just don't understand.
[01:56:39.580 --> 01:56:42.500]   Like we can't well, usually we can't talk about it is all like it's all we've got.
[01:56:42.500 --> 01:56:43.500]   It's all we've got.
[01:56:43.500 --> 01:56:44.500]   What you've been doing.
[01:56:44.500 --> 01:56:46.420]   Okay to, you know, to do it.
[01:56:46.420 --> 01:56:49.060]   But we can figure out why he had a shark tank in the basement to be honest.
[01:56:49.060 --> 01:56:50.980]   There's a lot of there's a lot of underwater.
[01:56:50.980 --> 01:56:53.060]   We did we now can do a three camera.
[01:56:53.060 --> 01:56:55.060]   We we we now have the capability.
[01:56:55.060 --> 01:56:57.140]   Well, next week we'll have the capability.
[01:56:57.140 --> 01:57:02.860]   We were ordering a couple pieces of the capability of doing a three camera hangout up to five
[01:57:02.860 --> 01:57:06.780]   miles out into the ocean up to 200 feet down.
[01:57:06.780 --> 01:57:09.020]   You know, I figured out what to do with that yet.
[01:57:09.020 --> 01:57:10.020]   But like once you put that.
[01:57:10.020 --> 01:57:13.380]   The other is this this is this like one of those glo mark explore thing.
[01:57:13.380 --> 01:57:14.380]   Yeah.
[01:57:14.380 --> 01:57:15.380]   I'm telling people is for Google hangout.
[01:57:15.380 --> 01:57:17.580]   I'm trying to get a Russian sub.
[01:57:17.580 --> 01:57:18.580]   Yes.
[01:57:18.580 --> 01:57:21.580]   I told him I was figure out how to do it.
[01:57:21.580 --> 01:57:23.580]   I'm going to go watch this project.
[01:57:23.580 --> 01:57:24.580]   This is a research of Cameron.
[01:57:24.580 --> 01:57:26.060]   It's for Avatar to.
[01:57:26.060 --> 01:57:29.420]   But anyway, but definitely I'm going to be able to post more and more of some of these
[01:57:29.420 --> 01:57:31.140]   ones that that we're working on.
[01:57:31.140 --> 01:57:34.340]   So if you but no, it'll all go punch you plus I'll tweet a lot of the stuff.
[01:57:34.340 --> 01:57:38.180]   But but I mean like that it's on G plus but that's where I'm kind of posting over time.
[01:57:38.180 --> 01:57:44.700]   Alex, who come literally the world the world's most foremost expert on how to do Google hangout.
[01:57:44.700 --> 01:57:46.540]   So well, how to do crazy ones anyway.
[01:57:46.540 --> 01:57:50.700]   I mean, we yeah, well, but we but if you can do it in a shark infested waters, you could
[01:57:50.700 --> 01:57:52.140]   probably pretty do it much anywhere.
[01:57:52.140 --> 01:57:53.940]   Outer space outer space.
[01:57:53.940 --> 01:57:54.940]   We've done outer space.
[01:57:54.940 --> 01:57:55.940]   Yeah.
[01:57:55.940 --> 01:57:57.180]   So thank you, Alex.
[01:57:57.180 --> 01:58:00.460]   Chris Breen is online at Chris Breen.com.
[01:58:00.460 --> 01:58:05.340]   The finally the hair of Breen Spreaks speaks system nine videos.
[01:58:05.340 --> 01:58:08.260]   He actually plays in a band with a fluegle horn.
[01:58:08.260 --> 01:58:12.420]   So that's that's another reason why you might want to go there to hear his music see and
[01:58:12.420 --> 01:58:13.420]   perform.
[01:58:13.420 --> 01:58:18.380]   And of course, he's the Mac Daddy, the Mac 911 column at Macworld.com.
[01:58:18.380 --> 01:58:19.380]   Great to have you.
[01:58:19.380 --> 01:58:25.460]   Mac soon, if not sooner, but by September 10th that we'd love to have you in.
[01:58:25.460 --> 01:58:26.660]   Are you going to go to the apple of enter?
[01:58:26.660 --> 01:58:29.460]   You want to come up here and hang out with us?
[01:58:29.460 --> 01:58:31.660]   You know, maybe I'll come up there and hang out with you guys.
[01:58:31.660 --> 01:58:32.660]   You're fun.
[01:58:32.660 --> 01:58:33.660]   You're fun.
[01:58:33.660 --> 01:58:34.660]   Bring your album, Mark.
[01:58:34.660 --> 01:58:37.260]   I'll bring the entire library.
[01:58:37.260 --> 01:58:40.500]   Yeah, always great to have you, Chris.
[01:58:40.500 --> 01:58:41.500]   Nice to see you.
[01:58:41.500 --> 01:58:42.500]   Thank you so much for being here.
[01:58:42.500 --> 01:58:46.940]   I know it's a little challenging via Skype to be part of the conversation, especially when
[01:58:46.940 --> 01:58:50.100]   there's a little lag, but you did a great job and I really appreciate it.
[01:58:50.100 --> 01:58:51.900]   Now I just love listening to you guys.
[01:58:51.900 --> 01:58:52.900]   Yes.
[01:58:52.900 --> 01:58:54.060]   You're so smart.
[01:58:54.060 --> 01:58:55.060]   Come up here.
[01:58:55.060 --> 01:58:56.060]   You could be a part of the conversation.
[01:58:56.060 --> 01:58:57.060]   That's what I'm saying.
[01:58:57.060 --> 01:58:58.060]   I'd love to.
[01:58:58.060 --> 01:58:59.060]   Yeah.
[01:58:59.060 --> 01:59:03.180]   And of course, the great ending and not go from the Chicago Sun times one of these days
[01:59:03.180 --> 01:59:05.140]   is 10 20 review will come out.
[01:59:05.140 --> 01:59:06.620]   No, you've done it, right?
[01:59:06.620 --> 01:59:08.380]   It's done.
[01:59:08.380 --> 01:59:09.380]   It's done.
[01:59:09.380 --> 01:59:13.180]   I had to push it before the Moto X review, which also had to be bunk because they had
[01:59:13.180 --> 01:59:15.940]   a manufacturing problem with my sample.
[01:59:15.940 --> 01:59:19.020]   Ah, turns out engraving root.
[01:59:19.020 --> 01:59:20.580]   It wasn't a root word.
[01:59:20.580 --> 01:59:23.380]   Apparently they're not going to be able to engrave when they first come out.
[01:59:23.380 --> 01:59:24.380]   They're going to be able to customize.
[01:59:24.380 --> 01:59:26.740]   But I just know the story is sitting and waving.
[01:59:26.740 --> 01:59:27.740]   But I appreciate that.
[01:59:27.740 --> 01:59:32.380]   I actually got a phone call yesterday from them and they handled it exactly the way that
[01:59:32.380 --> 01:59:37.540]   you should do that, which is to say we thought this product has been in beta.
[01:59:37.540 --> 01:59:39.460]   We thought that we had the technique down.
[01:59:39.460 --> 01:59:40.700]   We're not satisfied with the results.
[01:59:40.700 --> 01:59:43.740]   We're getting so we're not going to be offering it immediately, but we're going to be offering
[01:59:43.740 --> 01:59:45.860]   it when we got perfected, which we think will give you.
[01:59:45.860 --> 01:59:49.660]   In the meantime, we're going to send you your sample as you designed it without the screen.
[01:59:49.660 --> 01:59:51.060]   It's like, great, don't BS me.
[01:59:51.060 --> 01:59:52.060]   Don't tell me that.
[01:59:52.060 --> 01:59:55.060]   Don't just stop saying, oh, well, does it just a delay?
[01:59:55.060 --> 01:59:58.220]   We can't explain why, but there's a delay.
[01:59:58.220 --> 02:00:02.900]   They didn't have the little magnetic RFC things you were showing earlier.
[02:00:02.900 --> 02:00:07.100]   In fact, when I talked to Guy Kawasaki, he said, oh, yeah, don't mention that.
[02:00:07.100 --> 02:00:08.100]   But now they've got it.
[02:00:08.100 --> 02:00:09.100]   And it's great.
[02:00:09.100 --> 02:00:12.060]   And so they got what somebody showed us that I thought was really cool.
[02:00:12.060 --> 02:00:13.060]   Yeah.
[02:00:13.060 --> 02:00:18.860]   They're doing some cool things with authentication, just realizing that they're, the basic concept
[02:00:18.860 --> 02:00:21.780]   seems to be there can be many mechanisms to authenticate.
[02:00:21.780 --> 02:00:25.540]   And we're going to try to support as many of them as make sense as opposed to we're going
[02:00:25.540 --> 02:00:29.420]   to put in one magic bean inside here that will either work or not work.
[02:00:29.420 --> 02:00:37.820]   But they still don't have a fingerprint reader or solid gold.
[02:00:37.820 --> 02:00:38.820]   Thank you, Andy.
[02:00:38.820 --> 02:00:39.820]   Thank you, Alex.
