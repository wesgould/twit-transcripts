[00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:48.040]   In obsessive detail and the chief obsessors are here starting with Renee Richie of imore.com.
[00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:49.040]   Hello Renee.
[00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:52.640]   Hi Leo, it feels so far away all of a sudden being back across the continent.
[00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:55.840]   Snow is pouring down on you in beautiful Montreal.
[00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:59.360]   It is not as bad as western Canada but it's doing its best to keep me off the roads.
[00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:01.240]   It's a cold winter.
[00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:03.440]   We got cut down to 40 degrees here.
[00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:05.360]   I blame Al Gore for all of this.
[00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:06.760]   He wrote it and now it's happening.
[00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:11.400]   You said Jimmy Kimmel did a fun piece where he had all the LA newscasters bitching and
[00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:14.160]   moaning at how cold it was.
[00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:15.160]   The wind's blowing.
[00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:17.920]   Well that was in Petaluma in San Francisco.
[00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:20.320]   The whole one is complaining about the weather and for me it was a bright summer day.
[00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:21.320]   I know.
[00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:22.320]   Fantastic.
[00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:23.520]   I guess your perspective.
[00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:27.960]   That's Andy Inaco or other obsessor with a cube.
[00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:29.400]   Where'd you get that?
[00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:30.400]   Oh yeah.
[00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:35.160]   I was having a conversation with somebody about old computers.
[00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:37.520]   They happen to have this in the other room.
[00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:38.520]   And so I said, "Oh you want to see a cube?
[00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:39.520]   Here it is."
[00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:43.680]   It was the only way to like because he did not know like the coolest feature of the cube
[00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:47.320]   which is the Hal 9000 style.
[00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:49.160]   Here's how to remove the core.
[00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:50.160]   Right.
[00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:51.160]   I love how that.
[00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:52.160]   Yeah.
[00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:53.160]   Yeah.
[00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:55.960]   Which is still like you feel like if you spend more than $1200 for something there should
[00:02:55.960 --> 00:03:01.560]   be a thick mechanical like dual pump handle that is recessed.
[00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:05.920]   You have to punch down that ejects with a satisfying click that lets you pull out like
[00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:13.520]   a cork from a bottle, a cube of just packed green, the green circuit board and silver
[00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:15.160]   traces and ices.
[00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:18.280]   And then you say, "Okay, this is what I spent $1200 for."
[00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:20.400]   Do you want to do that later in the show?
[00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:21.400]   Sure.
[00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:22.400]   It might be if it's a slow show.
[00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:23.400]   Maybe we'll have it.
[00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:24.560]   Take a part of this cube.
[00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:26.400]   I wrote my first book on a cube.
[00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:27.400]   I love those cubes.
[00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:28.400]   I love them.
[00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:30.400]   Not my first book on a cube.
[00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:36.200]   It was probably my first unnecessary Mac purchase because they discontinued those pretty quickly
[00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:42.080]   and I had one on loan and Apple said, "Yeah, if you'd rather just not send it back if
[00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:43.080]   you didn't send it back."
[00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:45.080]   You know what this fact is?
[00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:47.520]   It's my pretty car never.
[00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:53.040]   And also with this Mr. Chris Brain, the hair brain, body brain, the whole brain.
[00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:54.040]   Old damn brain.
[00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:56.560]   All of the brain right here.
[00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:57.560]   It's freezing here.
[00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:59.560]   I think it's 70.
[00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:01.040]   We did.
[00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:05.800]   We've actually had pretty cold weather for the Bay Area.
[00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:09.600]   I mean it's been down to 18-19 degrees at night which is that's cold for us.
[00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:10.600]   That's really cold for us.
[00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:11.600]   That's unusually cold for us.
[00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:14.840]   Well, yeah, because we insulate our homes with cheese.
[00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:15.840]   Air.
[00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:16.840]   With no...
[00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:17.840]   Record albums.
[00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:20.920]   Everybody, you know, because we leave these cabagnos and we have these great decks and
[00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:23.560]   all the windows are open all the time and we've forgotten how to close them.
[00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:25.760]   And so when it gets down to 18, it gets chilly.
[00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:28.720]   Chris, is the Mac Daddy, the guy in charge of Mac 9-1-1?
[00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:30.760]   Or is it 4-1-1?
[00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:31.960]   There's a 1 in there somewhere.
[00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:33.760]   There are a couple of ones in there.
[00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:34.760]   The Macworld.com.
[00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:36.440]   It's always good to have you on.
[00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:38.240]   Thanks for joining us, Chris.
[00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:40.040]   We've seen more of your studio than we usually do.
[00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:42.840]   We see the whole kit and the kaboodle as well.
[00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:47.080]   Yeah, I've got a widescreen camera now so you can see just how ready to sleep.
[00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:48.520]   I'll jump up my office.
[00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:50.280]   Well, it looks like you're working.
[00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:52.160]   Yes, I am.
[00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:53.160]   And I'm trying to look...
[00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:58.600]   You know, every time Chris Isani puts an album up for us, I want to say Steely Dan because
[00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:02.440]   the light blew but I know that the thing in the middle, I don't know what that is.
[00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:03.440]   Is that...
[00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:06.640]   Let's see if anybody on Twitter gets it.
[00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:10.000]   I'm thinking singer-songwriter Loudon Wainwright III.
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:11.000]   That's just really close.
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:16.400]   But no, it's actually singer-songwriter John Martin who never really made it in this country.
[00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:19.400]   People tried really, really hard.
[00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:24.720]   Wonderful, kind of folky singer-songwriter kind of guy who had this mumble down to an
[00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:26.520]   amazing degree where he just sort of...
[00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:27.760]   Oh, mumble, mumble, mumble.
[00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:29.560]   You have no idea what he's saying.
[00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:30.560]   Arise.
[00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:34.720]   Yeah, but it was very sexy and very British.
[00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:36.760]   And so John Martin gets the pick today.
[00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:40.280]   And let me show you the gaucho cover because that's really...
[00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:43.760]   It is remarkably like the Steely Dan gaucho cover.
[00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:46.280]   And from a distance, you could excuse me for...
[00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:47.280]   Oh, I do.
[00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:48.280]   I do.
[00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:49.280]   For...
[00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:52.480]   Especially since it's somebody who never made it in the States.
[00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:54.000]   Yeah, no, they tried.
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:58.880]   I mean, even Phil Collins, but the force of his career behind John Martin.
[00:05:58.880 --> 00:05:59.880]   Really?
[00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:00.880]   Wow.
[00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:01.880]   Yeah.
[00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:02.880]   That's hard to believe.
[00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:03.880]   Wow.
[00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:04.880]   Wow.
[00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:05.880]   And America still said...
[00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:07.240]   I wonder, it just had a bigger close-up.
[00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:08.240]   He would have made it.
[00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:09.240]   I...
[00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:10.240]   No.
[00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:11.240]   No.
[00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:12.240]   I never heard of the guy.
[00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:13.240]   No.
[00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:14.240]   Never.
[00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:15.240]   Uh-uh.
[00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:16.240]   Also here, look at this.
[00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:18.280]   In studio, I love the best for last.
[00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:19.720]   He's pairing USB keys.
[00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:20.720]   I have keys.
[00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:21.720]   I have keys.
[00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:23.320]   128 gig USB drives.
[00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:24.720]   Mr. Alex Lindsey, good to see you.
[00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:26.120]   Thanks for installing for me.
[00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:27.120]   I was running late.
[00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:28.120]   It's good.
[00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:29.120]   What a surprise, as usual.
[00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:30.120]   It's kind of fun.
[00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:31.120]   I like doing the...
[00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:32.120]   The...
[00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:33.120]   Pre-show is great with you.
[00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:34.120]   I have...
[00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:35.120]   I have...
[00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:36.120]   I apologize.
[00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:37.120]   Um...
[00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:42.160]   I was busy trying to find something to say.
[00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:43.160]   There's no news.
[00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:44.160]   He's looking around.
[00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:45.400]   12 days, you have the...
[00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:46.920]   Renee Richie has the headline.
[00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:47.920]   12 days of Apple.
[00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:49.440]   12 days of gift.
[00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:53.320]   It's not Christmas this year and it's finally available in the US, so two big changes.
[00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:55.080]   It wasn't available in the...
[00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:56.080]   It was only Canada last time?
[00:06:56.080 --> 00:06:59.200]   It was the UK and then it went to Canada, I think, the next year.
[00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:02.160]   And this is the first year, I believe it's available in the US and it's also 12 days of
[00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:04.600]   gifts now, not 12 days of Christmas.
[00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:05.600]   It's fairly encompassing.
[00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:07.920]   I mean, there are going to be iBooks, there are going to be Rentals, there are going to
[00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:12.680]   be episodes of TV shows and it will notify you when the new one is available for download.
[00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:18.360]   Now, I got a laugh because Microsoft is also doing its 12 days promotion.
[00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:20.360]   It's called 12 days of deals.
[00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:21.360]   Nice.
[00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:22.360]   I just...
[00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:23.360]   Yeah.
[00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:24.360]   I'm...
[00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:25.360]   You know, it's kind of confusing.
[00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:26.920]   You've got 12 days.
[00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:30.000]   I guess that's, you know, like 12 days of Christmas.
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:31.240]   Gifts, deals, whatever.
[00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:32.240]   Microsoft's getting down there.
[00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:35.560]   I mean, some of these deals are really, really cheap.
[00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:38.040]   They start December 9th.
[00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:40.520]   I don't know why I'm telling the Mac break crowd about the Microsoft.
[00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:41.520]   Oh my God.
[00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:42.520]   Look at the deal on the Dell tablet pro.
[00:07:42.520 --> 00:07:45.120]   Because we're all going to run out and get one.
[00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:47.480]   Well, I was in town Leo for the first time I went over to the...
[00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:49.600]   I've never seen a Microsoft store in person before.
[00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:52.720]   So I went to Santana Road to the big mall across the street and there was an Apple store
[00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:55.800]   and immediately opposite, of course, was the Microsoft store.
[00:07:55.800 --> 00:07:56.920]   And the Apple store was...
[00:07:56.920 --> 00:08:00.880]   I could barely get into it, but I had a lot of availability in the Microsoft store.
[00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:01.880]   Yeah.
[00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:03.880]   And they really kind of look the same.
[00:08:03.880 --> 00:08:04.880]   Yeah.
[00:08:04.880 --> 00:08:05.880]   Look at the...
[00:08:05.880 --> 00:08:11.920]   It's funny the ways that there's in Boston, there's the landmark Boyleson Street Apple
[00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:16.320]   store and then there's the Microsoft store across the street in the potential.
[00:08:16.320 --> 00:08:22.240]   And the potential one is sort of like Bizarro World Apple store where it's like everything,
[00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:26.880]   every decision that Apple, in the broader sense, every decision that Apple made when
[00:08:26.880 --> 00:08:28.200]   Microsoft had to do the opposite.
[00:08:28.200 --> 00:08:32.840]   So whereas the Apple store is like a long, long bowling alley sort of thing in a mall
[00:08:32.840 --> 00:08:37.120]   store, the mall version of the Microsoft store is all horizontal.
[00:08:37.120 --> 00:08:38.120]   And when you...
[00:08:38.120 --> 00:08:39.120]   It's...
[00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:43.440]   And people wear shoes on their hands and they say goodbye when they enter the room.
[00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:46.680]   There's a significant difference in what Microsoft's doing and Apple's doing.
[00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:49.480]   Microsoft's starting there is actually already started there.
[00:08:49.480 --> 00:08:51.280]   Apple's waiting till after Christmas.
[00:08:51.280 --> 00:08:52.280]   Yeah.
[00:08:52.280 --> 00:08:54.280]   Because it's not Christmassy, it's gifts.
[00:08:54.280 --> 00:08:55.280]   Yeah.
[00:08:55.280 --> 00:09:00.440]   Also, it's also to be fair Microsoft has lots and lots of stock on almost all of the stores.
[00:09:00.440 --> 00:09:01.920]   It's like gifts, stuff to give away.
[00:09:01.920 --> 00:09:04.840]   So I mean, whereas for us Apple, it's more like we will sort of...
[00:09:04.840 --> 00:09:09.040]   We will email you a gift card if you decide to buy a device on this day, but otherwise
[00:09:09.040 --> 00:09:13.840]   we'd much rather you not just deplete our stock during the Christmas buying season.
[00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:19.480]   So this is, as you said, this happened in Europe, Canada, Japan.
[00:09:19.480 --> 00:09:22.240]   You have experienced this firsthand Renee Richie.
[00:09:22.240 --> 00:09:23.240]   Yeah, it was...
[00:09:23.240 --> 00:09:24.240]   What is it like?
[00:09:24.240 --> 00:09:26.240]   What is it like Renee?
[00:09:26.240 --> 00:09:30.480]   It was incredibly odd last year because unlike the UK, Apple tied it to newspapers.
[00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:34.040]   So for example, my local newspaper, the Montreal Gazette would print out something and they
[00:09:34.040 --> 00:09:37.760]   need to have to go and get the paper or look it up online and then go to the Apple store
[00:09:37.760 --> 00:09:38.760]   and get it.
[00:09:38.760 --> 00:09:40.360]   So it was a media partnership play.
[00:09:40.360 --> 00:09:44.960]   It was nowhere nearly as easy as it was in the UK where it was just tap here and get this.
[00:09:44.960 --> 00:09:46.720]   But this year it looks like it's really that easy.
[00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:50.520]   They'll send you a notification at midnight local time wherever you are and then you'll
[00:09:50.520 --> 00:09:56.200]   be able to go and download whatever the iBook is or the app is or the music is or the rental
[00:09:56.200 --> 00:09:57.200]   is.
[00:09:57.200 --> 00:10:01.000]   And they have a FAQ when you first download the app and install it, this little info button
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:04.240]   and you can press that and it gives you this long list of questions like whatever you're
[00:10:04.240 --> 00:10:08.560]   traveling, what if you downloaded your Apple TV but you later want to watch it on your
[00:10:08.560 --> 00:10:09.560]   iPhone.
[00:10:09.560 --> 00:10:12.800]   So it's a bit of a rigmarole but there's a lot of free stuff there.
[00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:15.880]   So the key is to download the app right now, right?
[00:10:15.880 --> 00:10:16.880]   Yeah.
[00:10:16.880 --> 00:10:17.880]   And it's way early.
[00:10:17.880 --> 00:10:23.480]   It has 17 or 16 days, it just gives you a big countdown on how long you have to wait.
[00:10:23.480 --> 00:10:25.000]   I think right now it's at 16 days.
[00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.280]   It's a little advent calendar but there's no chocolate.
[00:10:27.280 --> 00:10:28.280]   Yes, it's the trunks.
[00:10:28.280 --> 00:10:29.280]   Where's the trunks?
[00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:32.280]   Until our first gift.
[00:10:32.280 --> 00:10:35.120]   My mother got us an advent calendar.
[00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:36.120]   Yeah.
[00:10:36.120 --> 00:10:37.520]   My kids of course opened all the doors.
[00:10:37.520 --> 00:10:38.520]   All the doors.
[00:10:38.520 --> 00:10:39.520]   It was an Indebili hut.
[00:10:39.520 --> 00:10:40.520]   It was an Indebili hut.
[00:10:40.520 --> 00:10:41.520]   Oh, that's me.
[00:10:41.520 --> 00:10:42.520]   It was really cool actually.
[00:10:42.520 --> 00:10:43.520]   It was really cool actually.
[00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:45.280]   You build it up in the central square.
[00:10:45.280 --> 00:10:47.080]   Ours just has chocolate.
[00:10:47.080 --> 00:10:48.080]   At least 21.
[00:10:48.080 --> 00:10:49.280]   She's been going in order.
[00:10:49.280 --> 00:10:51.200]   One, two, three, four, five, six.
[00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:52.480]   Michael's 11.
[00:10:52.480 --> 00:10:53.480]   Right across the top.
[00:10:53.480 --> 00:10:54.480]   At least.
[00:10:54.480 --> 00:10:57.240]   At least it's one per day but right across the top.
[00:10:57.240 --> 00:11:01.120]   Too hard to find him because you know these advent calendars, they don't put them in order.
[00:11:01.120 --> 00:11:02.360]   They're all over the place.
[00:11:02.360 --> 00:11:04.000]   They got to have you skipping around.
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:07.440]   No, he took me a little while because I just thought my mom had sent me.
[00:11:07.440 --> 00:11:08.440]   That's neat.
[00:11:08.440 --> 00:11:12.080]   I thought that she had sent an Indebili hut which I thought was great because I didn't
[00:11:12.080 --> 00:11:16.600]   really realize what it was until all the windows were in a minute.
[00:11:16.600 --> 00:11:17.600]   There's music.
[00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:18.600]   Christmas music.
[00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:19.600]   Slots bar.
[00:11:19.600 --> 00:11:20.600]   Wait a minute.
[00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:21.600]   Is this the apple one?
[00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:22.600]   That's the right apple.
[00:11:22.600 --> 00:11:24.600]   I got the wrong app.
[00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:26.800]   I might not be the right app.
[00:11:26.800 --> 00:11:29.400]   I don't think apple would ever have had for gambling in the first slot.
[00:11:29.400 --> 00:11:30.400]   It's Christmas slots.
[00:11:30.400 --> 00:11:31.400]   Well, that's funny.
[00:11:31.400 --> 00:11:32.560]   It says 12 days of Christmas free.
[00:11:32.560 --> 00:11:34.320]   Oh, it's from quick apps.
[00:11:34.320 --> 00:11:35.320]   Here it is.
[00:11:35.320 --> 00:11:37.640]   Let's get the other one.
[00:11:37.640 --> 00:11:38.640]   Boy, I don't know.
[00:11:38.640 --> 00:11:40.560]   I might go back to the slots that looked interesting.
[00:11:40.560 --> 00:11:42.360]   It's cold for you.
[00:11:42.360 --> 00:11:43.360]   Yeah.
[00:11:43.360 --> 00:11:48.360]   Cool.
[00:11:48.360 --> 00:11:51.360]   Old day Christmas day free buffet at the quarter slots.
[00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:55.960]   I remember smoking is always allowed.
[00:11:55.960 --> 00:11:59.480]   We had our Christmas party at the new casino up the road a bit.
[00:11:59.480 --> 00:12:02.640]   The great and casino misnamed because it's not great.
[00:12:02.640 --> 00:12:04.840]   Chad, did anybody come ahead a winner?
[00:12:04.840 --> 00:12:07.720]   Yeah, I actually think Josh did.
[00:12:07.720 --> 00:12:10.480]   I came behind a loser.
[00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:13.080]   But Josh made you a hundred dollar bill.
[00:12:13.080 --> 00:12:15.840]   And the ones that came away at winter were the ones who went whooped the bill and left.
[00:12:15.840 --> 00:12:16.840]   And left.
[00:12:16.840 --> 00:12:17.840]   Right.
[00:12:17.840 --> 00:12:18.840]   Enjoyed that.
[00:12:18.840 --> 00:12:19.840]   That was you, Berg.
[00:12:19.840 --> 00:12:20.840]   You're the winner.
[00:12:20.840 --> 00:12:24.000]   But somebody told me that Glenn got his first pull at the slots.
[00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:25.480]   He won 116 bucks.
[00:12:25.480 --> 00:12:26.480]   What?
[00:12:26.480 --> 00:12:27.480]   Yeah.
[00:12:27.480 --> 00:12:28.480]   Extra.
[00:12:28.480 --> 00:12:29.480]   Or.
[00:12:29.480 --> 00:12:30.480]   And then he played it on his.
[00:12:30.480 --> 00:12:31.480]   Extra.
[00:12:31.480 --> 00:12:32.480]   Extra.
[00:12:32.480 --> 00:12:33.480]   Geez.
[00:12:33.480 --> 00:12:34.480]   Wow.
[00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:35.480]   Okay, here we go.
[00:12:35.480 --> 00:12:36.480]   Here's the apple.
[00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:37.480]   12 days of years.
[00:12:37.480 --> 00:12:38.480]   No music.
[00:12:38.480 --> 00:12:39.480]   No slots.
[00:12:39.480 --> 00:12:40.480]   I have to choose the store.
[00:12:40.480 --> 00:12:41.480]   Oh, these are so this is all the places it is.
[00:12:41.480 --> 00:12:42.480]   Yep.
[00:12:42.480 --> 00:12:43.480]   I'm going to go to the world.
[00:12:43.480 --> 00:12:48.320]   I mean, Suriname, Trinidad and Tobago, Oman, Niger, Netherlands, Nepal.
[00:12:48.320 --> 00:12:49.720]   That's just the ends.
[00:12:49.720 --> 00:12:51.080]   Holy magoli.
[00:12:51.080 --> 00:12:53.920]   I can't, I got to get back to me.
[00:12:53.920 --> 00:12:54.920]   It's quite a bit.
[00:12:54.920 --> 00:12:57.400]   So it pretty much looks like everywhere there's an Apple store.
[00:12:57.400 --> 00:12:58.400]   Yeah.
[00:12:58.400 --> 00:12:59.400]   Yeah.
[00:12:59.400 --> 00:13:01.800]   And the content will, of course, vary by region because not all the same stuff is available
[00:13:01.800 --> 00:13:02.800]   in the city.
[00:13:02.800 --> 00:13:03.800]   Yeah, obviously.
[00:13:03.800 --> 00:13:04.800]   Well, I can't find myself now.
[00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:06.400]   You're at the bottom United States.
[00:13:06.400 --> 00:13:08.640]   Yeah, this is my way up to Albania.
[00:13:08.640 --> 00:13:09.640]   All right.
[00:13:09.640 --> 00:13:12.440]   God forbid they just put it on a freaking web page.
[00:13:12.440 --> 00:13:17.840]   First, you download the app and then you register the app and then you tell it which of these
[00:13:17.840 --> 00:13:20.840]   hundred countries you're a part of hit the done in the corner.
[00:13:20.840 --> 00:13:21.840]   Oh, freaking ho.
[00:13:21.840 --> 00:13:22.840]   Done a top right.
[00:13:22.840 --> 00:13:23.840]   I know.
[00:13:23.840 --> 00:13:24.840]   Okay.
[00:13:24.840 --> 00:13:27.480]   But I just want to say isn't that what you would normally do?
[00:13:27.480 --> 00:13:28.480]   United States done.
[00:13:28.480 --> 00:13:31.600]   It's actually worse because it should just read the Apple store that you're logged in
[00:13:31.600 --> 00:13:33.480]   on the machine and not have to bother you with this.
[00:13:33.480 --> 00:13:35.640]   Oh, up here, there's a done.
[00:13:35.640 --> 00:13:36.640]   I hate.
[00:13:36.640 --> 00:13:38.360]   I hate iOS 7 lately.
[00:13:38.360 --> 00:13:40.920]   12 days would like to send me push notifications.
[00:13:40.920 --> 00:13:41.920]   Of course you would.
[00:13:41.920 --> 00:13:42.920]   Why not?
[00:13:42.920 --> 00:13:43.920]   I'm going to turn my screen down.
[00:13:43.920 --> 00:13:45.520]   This is one thing I like about iOS 7.
[00:13:45.520 --> 00:13:47.360]   I can do that easily.
[00:13:47.360 --> 00:13:48.360]   And now what?
[00:13:48.360 --> 00:13:49.360]   That's it.
[00:13:49.360 --> 00:13:50.360]   16 days.
[00:13:50.360 --> 00:13:51.360]   No music.
[00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:52.360]   No slides.
[00:13:52.360 --> 00:13:53.360]   Nothing.
[00:13:53.360 --> 00:13:54.360]   Nothing.
[00:13:54.360 --> 00:13:56.800]   Could they have given me a game to play?
[00:13:56.800 --> 00:13:57.800]   Exactly.
[00:13:57.800 --> 00:13:59.240]   Thank you for your personal information.
[00:13:59.240 --> 00:14:01.200]   Well, here's the static page for you.
[00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:02.200]   And you got it.
[00:14:02.200 --> 00:14:03.200]   Waiting game.
[00:14:03.200 --> 00:14:04.520]   That is going to, I mean, why make it an app?
[00:14:04.520 --> 00:14:05.520]   Why?
[00:14:05.520 --> 00:14:06.520]   Think about it.
[00:14:06.520 --> 00:14:07.520]   Why make it an app?
[00:14:07.520 --> 00:14:08.520]   And why do it two weeks early?
[00:14:08.520 --> 00:14:11.040]   So it could follow me around day after day.
[00:14:11.040 --> 00:14:12.600]   I'm traveling outside the country.
[00:14:12.600 --> 00:14:14.640]   Does that affect the countdown?
[00:14:14.640 --> 00:14:16.360]   This is the FAQ.
[00:14:16.360 --> 00:14:17.360]   How do I download my gift?
[00:14:17.360 --> 00:14:19.880]   It stops when you leave America.
[00:14:19.880 --> 00:14:21.800]   Where can I find my gift?
[00:14:21.800 --> 00:14:22.800]   So what, so you're going to...
[00:14:22.800 --> 00:14:27.600]   Where's my wild going to Ghana to buy it?
[00:14:27.600 --> 00:14:32.240]   So what, okay, so Renee, do we know what these gifts are going to be or what?
[00:14:32.240 --> 00:14:33.760]   If you read the FAQ, you can get a hint.
[00:14:33.760 --> 00:14:35.440]   Like it does say there'll be movie rentals.
[00:14:35.440 --> 00:14:36.960]   There'll be TV show episodes.
[00:14:36.960 --> 00:14:37.960]   There'll be iBooks.
[00:14:37.960 --> 00:14:40.920]   And it says, for example, you have to have iBooks downloaded to get the iBook.
[00:14:40.920 --> 00:14:43.480]   You have to have an Apple account to get the...
[00:14:43.480 --> 00:14:45.840]   If you want to get more episodes of the free episode, they give you...
[00:14:45.840 --> 00:14:48.200]   So it's just going to be a variety of stuff from the iTunes store.
[00:14:48.200 --> 00:14:49.600]   A free movie rental school.
[00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:51.880]   Unless there's 21 Jump Street, then I don't care.
[00:14:51.880 --> 00:14:53.480]   It's going to be a Christmas story.
[00:14:53.480 --> 00:14:54.480]   Do we get to pick it?
[00:14:54.480 --> 00:14:57.760]   Do you think there will be any movie?
[00:14:57.760 --> 00:14:58.760]   Your wonderful life.
[00:14:58.760 --> 00:14:59.760]   Star Wars Christmas.
[00:14:59.760 --> 00:15:00.760]   Yeah, I'm guessing they'll be there.
[00:15:00.760 --> 00:15:01.760]   Why tell you wonderful life?
[00:15:01.760 --> 00:15:02.760]   Again.
[00:15:02.760 --> 00:15:03.760]   I would...
[00:15:03.760 --> 00:15:04.760]   You know what?
[00:15:04.760 --> 00:15:06.960]   If they do Star Wars Christmas, two thumbs up.

[00:15:09.160 --> 00:15:11.160]   Christmas shoes.
[00:15:11.160 --> 00:15:12.160]   Yeah.
[00:15:12.160 --> 00:15:13.160]   The exceptional.
[00:15:13.160 --> 00:15:14.160]   We don't know.
[00:15:14.160 --> 00:15:15.160]   But what was it in Canada last year?
[00:15:15.160 --> 00:15:16.160]   Was it like, what did you get?
[00:15:16.160 --> 00:15:18.160]   It was a couple Christmas songs.
[00:15:18.160 --> 00:15:20.160]   So I forget what they were about books.
[00:15:20.160 --> 00:15:23.160]   It's a specific thing.
[00:15:23.160 --> 00:15:25.320]   Yeah.
[00:15:25.320 --> 00:15:26.320]   Personal data collected.
[00:15:26.320 --> 00:15:27.320]   Yeah.
[00:15:27.320 --> 00:15:28.320]   All right.
[00:15:28.320 --> 00:15:29.320]   Oh, I can...
[00:15:29.320 --> 00:15:30.320]   It's not a very aptly app though.
[00:15:30.320 --> 00:15:32.640]   I mean, like, it doesn't already pull your information from the thing.
[00:15:32.640 --> 00:15:35.040]   It doesn't look like iOS 7 in any way, shape, or form.
[00:15:35.040 --> 00:15:36.040]   The icon is completely...
[00:15:36.040 --> 00:15:39.120]   If you go to the home screen, the icon does not look like an iOS 7 icon.
[00:15:39.120 --> 00:15:40.120]   Let's see.
[00:15:40.120 --> 00:15:43.920]   It's hard to choose between that and 12 days free, which should I...
[00:15:43.920 --> 00:15:46.000]   That's got a lovely lady on it singing.
[00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:47.520]   It's what I know.
[00:15:47.520 --> 00:15:49.040]   This is how Apple should...
[00:15:49.040 --> 00:15:50.520]   It's more thick, Leo.
[00:15:50.520 --> 00:15:51.520]   It's far too thick.
[00:15:51.520 --> 00:15:52.520]   It's more thick.
[00:15:52.520 --> 00:15:53.520]   And there's slots.
[00:15:53.520 --> 00:15:55.160]   We have a quiz.
[00:15:55.160 --> 00:15:57.360]   There were slots before.
[00:15:57.360 --> 00:15:59.480]   Oh, there's different ads all the time.
[00:15:59.480 --> 00:16:00.480]   This is American Express now.
[00:16:00.480 --> 00:16:01.480]   I'm gonna give you more.
[00:16:01.480 --> 00:16:05.320]   I know what the point of the Apple app is.
[00:16:05.320 --> 00:16:10.040]   It's not just to... instead of keeping you in control of the gift-getting experience,
[00:16:10.040 --> 00:16:14.600]   it sort of wants to keep you like in a state of mild panic until Christmas day.
[00:16:14.600 --> 00:16:17.600]   You never know when that phone's gonna go off in your pocket, when you have to drop
[00:16:17.600 --> 00:16:22.720]   your kit, pick up your phone, claim your copy of "Grandma Got Run Over by a Rain Deer."
[00:16:22.720 --> 00:16:25.480]   Not the song, but the lame cartoons show.
[00:16:25.480 --> 00:16:28.880]   Look, though, I can share it with my friends.
[00:16:28.880 --> 00:16:29.880]   Let me just tweet.
[00:16:29.880 --> 00:16:30.880]   Limit a quantity.
[00:16:30.880 --> 00:16:34.120]   Download the free 12 days of gift app to get a tip from iTunes every day for January
[00:16:34.120 --> 00:16:36.400]   20, February 20, 12 days.
[00:16:36.400 --> 00:16:37.400]   And that's it.
[00:16:37.400 --> 00:16:38.400]   And I could post it.
[00:16:38.400 --> 00:16:39.400]   Always drink your oval team.
[00:16:39.400 --> 00:16:42.200]   And they did it quite right because there's four characters left in case I want to put
[00:16:42.200 --> 00:16:43.200]   in a personal message.
[00:16:43.200 --> 00:16:45.240]   Why does this keep turning up the brightness?
[00:16:45.240 --> 00:16:46.240]   Nope.
[00:16:46.240 --> 00:16:47.960]   It's doing for your own good.
[00:16:47.960 --> 00:16:49.520]   Seriously, I didn't I turn down the brightness?
[00:16:49.520 --> 00:16:50.520]   Am I wrong?
[00:16:50.520 --> 00:16:54.040]   Yeah, unless you turn off the automatic, it's still gonna try and match the ambient light
[00:16:54.040 --> 00:16:55.040]   sensor.
[00:16:55.040 --> 00:16:56.040]   Okay.
[00:16:56.040 --> 00:16:58.680]   In other words, I don't know what I'm doing.
[00:16:58.680 --> 00:17:00.080]   Surrender to the machine, Leo.
[00:17:00.080 --> 00:17:01.080]   Surrender to the machine.
[00:17:01.080 --> 00:17:02.080]   I'm sorry.
[00:17:02.080 --> 00:17:03.080]   I'm cranky.
[00:17:03.080 --> 00:17:04.080]   I apologize.
[00:17:04.080 --> 00:17:05.080]   I love this app.
[00:17:05.080 --> 00:17:06.080]   Thank you, Apple.
[00:17:06.080 --> 00:17:07.080]   It's 12 things free.
[00:17:07.080 --> 00:17:10.720]   I don't have to pay tax on them, do I?
[00:17:10.720 --> 00:17:11.720]   Mm.
[00:17:11.720 --> 00:17:12.720]   Part of no.
[00:17:12.720 --> 00:17:13.720]   Part of no.
[00:17:13.720 --> 00:17:14.720]   Part of no.
[00:17:14.720 --> 00:17:15.720]   Wow.
[00:17:15.720 --> 00:17:18.360]   Is there a place on your form to fill in free iTunes gifts on your TV?
[00:17:18.360 --> 00:17:21.520]   Somebody pointed out in the chatroom the 12 days icon at least should count down.
[00:17:21.520 --> 00:17:22.520]   P.
[00:17:22.520 --> 00:17:23.760]   Della had a Patrick said that it doesn't.
[00:17:23.760 --> 00:17:25.240]   It just says 12.
[00:17:25.240 --> 00:17:26.240]   No.
[00:17:26.240 --> 00:17:31.240]   Of course it'd be confusing if it said 16 and it's the 12 days app.
[00:17:31.240 --> 00:17:32.720]   Well, of course they need though.
[00:17:32.720 --> 00:17:39.040]   They need to have that connected to gifts that use I beacon to tell you where to go.
[00:17:39.040 --> 00:17:43.760]   I also point out that even though I've been making fun of this app, this is an app that
[00:17:43.760 --> 00:17:45.920]   is designed to give us free things that we're complaining about.
[00:17:45.920 --> 00:17:46.920]   I know.
[00:17:46.920 --> 00:17:47.920]   I know.
[00:17:47.920 --> 00:17:48.920]   I'm a bad man.
[00:17:48.920 --> 00:17:49.920]   I apologize.
[00:17:49.920 --> 00:17:52.960]   Uncle Steve, this gift wrap is really hard to open.
[00:17:52.960 --> 00:17:54.760]   Bye, humbug.
[00:17:54.760 --> 00:17:55.760]   Thanks for the Xbox.
[00:17:55.760 --> 00:18:01.560]   You think I want to spend the day opening your stupid present or playing with it.
[00:18:01.560 --> 00:18:02.560]   Let's take a break.
[00:18:02.560 --> 00:18:03.560]   What about I beacon?
[00:18:03.560 --> 00:18:06.320]   Because actually I think that is the biggest story of the week and maybe of the year and
[00:18:06.320 --> 00:18:08.880]   Apple punked everyone.
[00:18:08.880 --> 00:18:10.360]   I love it.
[00:18:10.360 --> 00:18:12.240]   But we'll talk about that in a moment.
[00:18:12.240 --> 00:18:15.760]   Where's the word from square space?
[00:18:15.760 --> 00:18:20.560]   The best place to go when you need to get a website up and running fast.
[00:18:20.560 --> 00:18:21.560]   Square space is hosting.
[00:18:21.560 --> 00:18:22.560]   Beautiful.
[00:18:22.560 --> 00:18:26.920]   When you when you buy an annual plan, they give you the domain name for free, the register
[00:18:26.920 --> 00:18:30.000]   for free for free and and they hook it up for free.
[00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:31.880]   So you got that going for you.
[00:18:31.880 --> 00:18:34.360]   And then it's the best hosting software.
[00:18:34.360 --> 00:18:36.760]   I mean, content management software as well.
[00:18:36.760 --> 00:18:40.720]   And one of the reasons I think square space works so well is they're so tightly integrated.
[00:18:40.720 --> 00:18:45.280]   They start with a 20 professionally designed, gorgeous templates.
[00:18:45.280 --> 00:18:47.200]   But they're just the beginning point.
[00:18:47.200 --> 00:18:49.120]   The templates have all the features you want.
[00:18:49.120 --> 00:18:55.000]   Mobile responsive design means that the template itself will reformat itself for any size screen.
[00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:56.960]   So just kind of reflows around.
[00:18:56.960 --> 00:18:59.040]   It also has, you know, you can enable commerce.
[00:18:59.040 --> 00:19:03.640]   You have great plugins for all the social media, you know, Twitter and Facebook and LinkedIn
[00:19:03.640 --> 00:19:06.640]   and Instagram and for screen, you know, all that stuff.
[00:19:06.640 --> 00:19:09.800]   And so that makes it very easy to, you know, just drag and drop those on there.
[00:19:09.800 --> 00:19:11.920]   You can resize and move everything around.
[00:19:11.920 --> 00:19:13.120]   And it never breaks.
[00:19:13.120 --> 00:19:14.120]   I love this.
[00:19:14.120 --> 00:19:15.120]   You can do all the stuff you want to do.
[00:19:15.120 --> 00:19:18.880]   And it never breaks the mobile responsive design, which is which is really cool.
[00:19:18.880 --> 00:19:22.880]   It's in fact, if you look, if you look at the code underneath the the JavaScript edge
[00:19:22.880 --> 00:19:24.200]   gorgeous, it's elegant.
[00:19:24.200 --> 00:19:28.920]   These guys took a lot of time to get it done right.
[00:19:28.920 --> 00:19:31.560]   Search engine optimization, of course, your site.
[00:19:31.560 --> 00:19:35.360]   Not only can be crawled by Google, but it generates a site map automatically, which is
[00:19:35.360 --> 00:19:36.560]   what Google recommends.
[00:19:36.560 --> 00:19:39.040]   Yahoo Bing, all the other search engines too.
[00:19:39.040 --> 00:19:40.080]   It's everything you need.
[00:19:40.080 --> 00:19:44.320]   And amazingly, for free for the first two weeks, so you can really get a sense of it.
[00:19:44.320 --> 00:19:47.520]   You can even import all your existing content.
[00:19:47.520 --> 00:19:49.520]   If you know, it supports the major blog, APIs.
[00:19:49.520 --> 00:19:53.760]   And in fact, when it imports your content, it imports your images, your comments, everything.
[00:19:53.760 --> 00:19:59.080]   I've never mentioned the commenting system, a really nice commenting system built in.
[00:19:59.080 --> 00:20:00.080]   Support 24/7.
[00:20:00.080 --> 00:20:03.640]   They just want a golden Stevie for outstanding service.
[00:20:03.640 --> 00:20:05.640]   They really know what they're doing.
[00:20:05.640 --> 00:20:09.400]   And when you decide to buy after two weeks, if you decide this site is working for me,
[00:20:09.400 --> 00:20:11.960]   I like it, the price is right.
[00:20:11.960 --> 00:20:15.280]   Eight dollars a month for the standard plan.
[00:20:15.280 --> 00:20:17.320]   Most people are going to go with the $16 a month.
[00:20:17.320 --> 00:20:20.720]   These prices are all when you buy an annual plan, but you can also go month to month if
[00:20:20.720 --> 00:20:21.720]   you want.
[00:20:21.720 --> 00:20:24.680]   But the annual plan is going to give you a better deal, especially when I give you our
[00:20:24.680 --> 00:20:26.080]   offer code.
[00:20:26.080 --> 00:20:29.520]   $16 a month gives you unlimited everything, including bandwidth.
[00:20:29.520 --> 00:20:31.720]   You'll never get a bandwidth bill.
[00:20:31.720 --> 00:20:36.520]   If you buy the annual plan, like I said, you get the domain name registration built in.
[00:20:36.520 --> 00:20:37.800]   They have a developer platform.
[00:20:37.800 --> 00:20:43.080]   If you are a JavaScript and a CSS guru, the developer platform is great with it.
[00:20:43.080 --> 00:20:46.000]   Sit color coding and syntax and all of that stuff.
[00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:49.320]   If you want to do commerce, $24 a month.
[00:20:49.320 --> 00:20:50.320]   And that includes everything.
[00:20:50.320 --> 00:20:53.320]   They don't take transaction fees from you.
[00:20:53.320 --> 00:20:57.400]   It's unlimited inventory, digital, physical, services.
[00:20:57.400 --> 00:21:01.040]   They handle shipping calculations, tax calculations.
[00:21:01.040 --> 00:21:02.720]   They help you with inventory.
[00:21:02.720 --> 00:21:07.280]   I mean, this really is the nicest, simplest and yet most sophisticated.
[00:21:07.280 --> 00:21:09.240]   And I think that goes hand in hand.
[00:21:09.240 --> 00:21:12.000]   It's simple because it's so sophisticated system.
[00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:17.120]   Squarespace.com, when you decide to buy, do one, do me one solid here.

[00:21:34.480 --> 00:21:40.280]   I, Beacon, we've talked a little bit about it before.
[00:21:40.280 --> 00:21:41.960]   In fact, we've known about it for some time.
[00:21:41.960 --> 00:21:44.080]   Apple talked about it at the World Wide Developer Conference.
[00:21:44.080 --> 00:21:48.080]   It was a slide on that.
[00:21:48.080 --> 00:21:51.080]   But I think we miss underestimated.
[00:21:51.080 --> 00:21:53.080]   I think there was a moment last week.
[00:21:53.080 --> 00:21:58.440]   There was a moment last week where Tim went into the back room and said, "Release the
[00:21:58.440 --> 00:21:59.440]   Kraken!"
[00:21:59.440 --> 00:22:01.440]   He flipped the switch.
[00:22:01.440 --> 00:22:03.600]   So what is first described?
[00:22:03.600 --> 00:22:05.000]   Alex, why don't you do the honors?
[00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:06.720]   What is IBECAN, first of all?
[00:22:06.720 --> 00:22:12.480]   So IBECAN is it is Bluetooth, low energy or LE.
[00:22:12.480 --> 00:22:13.960]   And what it allows...
[00:22:13.960 --> 00:22:16.520]   So I view it just parenthetically.
[00:22:16.520 --> 00:22:19.680]   If you have a Fitbit, it's kind of cool because you don't have to...
[00:22:19.680 --> 00:22:20.680]   The Flex.
[00:22:20.680 --> 00:22:22.280]   You don't have to pair it.
[00:22:22.280 --> 00:22:24.320]   You run the Fitbit app and it knows it's there.
[00:22:24.320 --> 00:22:25.320]   It knows it's close.
[00:22:25.320 --> 00:22:27.120]   It's Bluetooth without pairing.
[00:22:27.120 --> 00:22:29.280]   It just kind of sees it.
[00:22:29.280 --> 00:22:30.280]   Right.
[00:22:30.280 --> 00:22:32.280]   And with theirs, there are a couple different ways.
[00:22:32.280 --> 00:22:35.360]   And it turned out that there's a lot of ways to turn this on.
[00:22:35.360 --> 00:22:41.480]   It turns out that every iPhone, iPad, since I believe the 4S, is that correct?
[00:22:41.480 --> 00:22:42.480]   Yeah.
[00:22:42.480 --> 00:22:46.960]   It has had what it needs to become an IBECAN.
[00:22:46.960 --> 00:22:53.520]   There's also basically quarter sized little devices that will allow it to be put into
[00:22:53.520 --> 00:22:54.520]   stores.
[00:22:54.520 --> 00:22:55.520]   And I think that's what Apple's actually using.
[00:22:55.520 --> 00:22:57.280]   I think Macy's is using it as well.
[00:22:57.280 --> 00:23:02.040]   But the big thing is it's going to let you get people down to the last foot, which is
[00:23:02.040 --> 00:23:03.040]   a big deal.
[00:23:03.040 --> 00:23:09.600]   I think that a lot of us think about being able to search Google Maps or Apple Maps or
[00:23:09.600 --> 00:23:11.920]   whatever to figure out where they are in San Francisco.
[00:23:11.920 --> 00:23:15.160]   But once you get into the mall, once you get into the store, we don't know where you
[00:23:15.160 --> 00:23:16.160]   are anymore.
[00:23:16.160 --> 00:23:17.160]   You don't know where you are anymore.
[00:23:17.160 --> 00:23:21.680]   And so it can be as mundane as being able to find information about an object, about
[00:23:21.680 --> 00:23:23.280]   something that you're at at the store.
[00:23:23.280 --> 00:23:25.680]   But it could also be like, where are the restrooms?
[00:23:25.680 --> 00:23:27.520]   Where is this store in the mall?
[00:23:27.520 --> 00:23:28.520]   Where is?
[00:23:28.520 --> 00:23:30.440]   So there's a lot of opportunity there.
[00:23:30.440 --> 00:23:33.680]   There's an awful lot of opportunity when it comes to museums.
[00:23:33.680 --> 00:23:39.000]   A lot of people pay 20 bucks a pop to look goofy with that little thing that they put
[00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:40.000]   in their ear.
[00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:43.480]   Have you seen those little things that you walk around and you walk up to the different
[00:23:43.480 --> 00:23:44.480]   things?
[00:23:44.480 --> 00:23:45.480]   And you have to enter in the number or something.
[00:23:45.480 --> 00:23:46.800]   And in the number where you are.
[00:23:46.800 --> 00:23:49.760]   So imagine being able to just have your headset and be able to walk around Legion of Honor
[00:23:49.760 --> 00:23:54.640]   and say, first of all, be able to say, where is Picasso and have it give you directions
[00:23:54.640 --> 00:23:55.880]   to Picasso.
[00:23:55.880 --> 00:23:58.560]   And then once you get there, it gives you information about the painting that you're
[00:23:58.560 --> 00:24:00.360]   looking at.
[00:24:00.360 --> 00:24:03.360]   And of course, there's a lot of opportunity when you're in stores wanting to get more
[00:24:03.360 --> 00:24:07.720]   information about given objects where you don't have to use a QR code or you don't
[00:24:07.720 --> 00:24:13.960]   have to type it in, you're simply, I'm here in front of these pieces of electronics or
[00:24:13.960 --> 00:24:15.760]   these, all these other things.
[00:24:15.760 --> 00:24:20.000]   And I can get video and all kinds of other things without having to try to put it in
[00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:23.320]   kiosks and so on and so forth around using everybody's iPhones.
[00:24:23.320 --> 00:24:25.640]   So there's two salient points.
[00:24:25.640 --> 00:24:28.440]   And then I'd love for you guys to discuss what it means.
[00:24:28.440 --> 00:24:31.840]   The two salient points are it's a two-way conversation.
[00:24:31.840 --> 00:24:36.040]   So an I-beacon can send your phone information, your phone is sending an I-beacon location.
[00:24:36.040 --> 00:24:37.600]   If you choose to.
[00:24:37.600 --> 00:24:39.720]   All of it is, you turn it on.
[00:24:39.720 --> 00:24:43.880]   The second, I think, really interesting thing is that Apple, I don't know if they ever told
[00:24:43.880 --> 00:24:45.840]   anyone, maybe you guys could tell me.
[00:24:45.840 --> 00:24:53.040]   But what we found out this week is that every iOS device since the iPhone 4S is an I-beacon,
[00:24:53.040 --> 00:24:56.800]   furthermore, anything that does Bluetooth, and that includes Galaxy S3 and 4, the Nexus
[00:24:56.800 --> 00:25:01.720]   4, later the HTC One, the Droid DNA, there are a lot of Android phones also.
[00:25:01.720 --> 00:25:03.800]   All of these are effectively I-beacons.
[00:25:03.800 --> 00:25:06.320]   I-beacon is not an Apple I.
[00:25:06.320 --> 00:25:07.960]   It is a standard, I believe.
[00:25:07.960 --> 00:25:09.440]   I'm not sure about that, but-
[00:25:09.440 --> 00:25:11.600]   It's an Apple trademark, but I believe you can-
[00:25:11.600 --> 00:25:13.600]   I believe it's a standard, though.
[00:25:13.600 --> 00:25:16.800]   And it's basically, Bluetooth LE is a standard.
[00:25:16.800 --> 00:25:18.520]   Let's put it that way.
[00:25:18.520 --> 00:25:26.080]   And did Apple ever tell anybody that this was a two-way-st-that your phone?
[00:25:26.080 --> 00:25:29.680]   And the reason I mention this, and I read an article that said, "For instance, LeBron
[00:25:29.680 --> 00:25:37.120]   James has a shoe store in Miami where every shoe display has an iPad."
[00:25:37.120 --> 00:25:42.240]   So that shoe store is now already with a couple of changes in the settings.
[00:25:42.240 --> 00:25:46.600]   I-beacon in every single product.
[00:25:46.600 --> 00:25:51.680]   And I was talking to Mike Elgin yesterday, and he's basically saying Apple's long-term
[00:25:51.680 --> 00:25:56.880]   retail strategy is to make every store an Apple store an effect.
[00:25:56.880 --> 00:26:00.280]   That every store become- the retail experience becomes like it is in the Apple store.
[00:26:00.280 --> 00:26:02.880]   All right, now that's- those are the points I'd like to make.
[00:26:02.880 --> 00:26:04.080]   And I'd like to know what you guys think.
[00:26:04.080 --> 00:26:07.240]   There's a lot of privacy implications, payment implications.
[00:26:07.240 --> 00:26:08.240]   What does it mean for-
[00:26:08.240 --> 00:26:10.320]   And I want- Chris Brain, you want to kick it off?
[00:26:10.320 --> 00:26:11.320]   Sure.
[00:26:11.320 --> 00:26:15.520]   I think this is the realization of the iPhone is money, and I think we've been talking about
[00:26:15.520 --> 00:26:17.880]   this for quite some time and the potential for it to be.
[00:26:17.880 --> 00:26:19.600]   But here's the scenario.
[00:26:19.600 --> 00:26:25.200]   I walk into Costco, for example, and my phone knows that I've purchased a life vest there
[00:26:25.200 --> 00:26:26.920]   two weeks ago.
[00:26:26.920 --> 00:26:30.480]   I've allowed it to communicate with the Costco app to the sensors that are in the store.
[00:26:30.480 --> 00:26:35.640]   I walk in and Costco says, "Oh, by the way, we have some wonderful kayaks that we just
[00:26:35.640 --> 00:26:40.720]   got in that are going to go really well with the life jacket that you just purchased.
[00:26:40.720 --> 00:26:41.720]   And here's how to get here.
[00:26:41.720 --> 00:26:44.240]   And it draws a little map for me and I'll talk, talk, talk, talk, talk, talk, talk, talk,
[00:26:44.240 --> 00:26:45.240]   talk, talk, talk, talk, talk, talk, talk, talk, talk, talk, talk, talk, talk, talk, take
[00:26:45.240 --> 00:26:46.240]   a left.
[00:26:46.240 --> 00:26:47.240]   And here's the kayak.
[00:26:47.240 --> 00:26:48.240]   Great.
[00:26:48.240 --> 00:26:49.240]   It's got a QR code on it.
[00:26:49.240 --> 00:26:50.240]   I scan it with my camera.
[00:26:50.240 --> 00:26:53.600]   I pay with it because I can on my phone once they open that up.
[00:26:53.600 --> 00:26:57.560]   And instead of waiting in that line, that's 10 deep because three people have forgotten
[00:26:57.560 --> 00:27:03.360]   to update their subscription to Costco, I'm dragging my kayak out of the store and I'm
[00:27:03.360 --> 00:27:04.480]   on the water.
[00:27:04.480 --> 00:27:10.960]   So again, iPhone as money because these devices can talk to each other.
[00:27:10.960 --> 00:27:13.200]   And they know my purchase history.
[00:27:13.200 --> 00:27:14.840]   They know what I might be interested in.
[00:27:14.840 --> 00:27:16.360]   They know where everything is in the store.
[00:27:16.360 --> 00:27:17.680]   They can direct me to it.
[00:27:17.680 --> 00:27:23.240]   And then with a simple push of a button, I can scan a code and I can drive the item out.
[00:27:23.240 --> 00:27:25.960]   So I think it's hugely powerful.
[00:27:25.960 --> 00:27:26.960]   Andy?
[00:27:26.960 --> 00:27:34.000]   Every time I see a practical demo of this, including the demos from Apple, I nod and
[00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:39.720]   say, wow, I'm very happy for you, this other company, that you have this technology that
[00:27:39.720 --> 00:27:44.680]   will benefit you, other companies so well, I don't see how it makes my life any better.
[00:27:44.680 --> 00:27:48.640]   I don't see how it makes my iPhone any more valuable.
[00:27:48.640 --> 00:27:54.800]   It would be nice, most of the demonstrations are things that involve commerce.
[00:27:54.800 --> 00:27:55.800]   And you know what?
[00:27:55.800 --> 00:28:00.200]   I don't want a store to know that I was lingering in front of a certain display for 8.9 seconds
[00:28:00.200 --> 00:28:04.560]   and I'm the same person who was also lingering at this other display for 4.4 seconds and
[00:28:04.560 --> 00:28:07.000]   the sequence in which that sort of stuff happened.
[00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:10.960]   I'm not sure that they could give me information automatically that I wouldn't want to request
[00:28:10.960 --> 00:28:14.560]   specifically by checking my phone or by checking a kiosk.
[00:28:14.560 --> 00:28:19.920]   It would be nice if this were something that made my life in general better.
[00:28:19.920 --> 00:28:25.800]   If I didn't have to take a picture of the pillar that I parked next to in a parking garage,
[00:28:25.800 --> 00:28:29.080]   if there were a network of beacons that would let me say, oh, by the way, here is where you
[00:28:29.080 --> 00:28:32.120]   are inside this parking garage, here's where you left your car.
[00:28:32.120 --> 00:28:35.440]   Or if you're in a museum or if you're in a point of interest and you're just curious
[00:28:35.440 --> 00:28:42.240]   as to, you know, I'm at the, I'm at the Presidio, where do I find the statue of a, where do
[00:28:42.240 --> 00:28:44.440]   I get to the Palace of Fine Arts from here?
[00:28:44.440 --> 00:28:49.200]   But the problem with that is that it is based on an open sort, an open technology.
[00:28:49.200 --> 00:28:53.680]   It is built on Bluetooth LE, which isn't pretty much anything that you can buy these
[00:28:53.680 --> 00:28:56.320]   days, that's a mobile device.
[00:28:56.320 --> 00:29:01.080]   But we don't, excuse me, I don't know yet that it is something that absolutely anybody
[00:29:01.080 --> 00:29:06.360]   can create devices to establish themselves as eye beacons or apps that will actually
[00:29:06.360 --> 00:29:07.360]   support it.
[00:29:07.360 --> 00:29:12.360]   This becomes a way for iPhone users to have a better time than anybody else.
[00:29:12.360 --> 00:29:16.720]   I don't know how, if I'm the owner of that mall parking garage, if I'm the owner of
[00:29:16.720 --> 00:29:23.120]   that other store, if, why, why is it my job to create a solution that will help maybe
[00:29:23.120 --> 00:29:27.240]   half of the people with phones that are going into my store, wouldn't I much rather go for
[00:29:27.240 --> 00:29:31.080]   another Bluetooth LE solution that will work on absolutely everything?
[00:29:31.080 --> 00:29:35.600]   Moreover, something that another maker with another operating system doesn't get first
[00:29:35.600 --> 00:29:37.360]   dibs on that data.
[00:29:37.360 --> 00:29:39.120]   I don't think it's a bad idea at all.
[00:29:39.120 --> 00:29:43.520]   I just think that we have to wait to see how this is implemented on a widespread way.
[00:29:43.520 --> 00:29:47.520]   I've said before that I would love to see if Apple, I would love it if Apple decided
[00:29:47.520 --> 00:29:55.400]   to, for instance, turn every Mac, every device and, excuse me, every desktop and every Apple
[00:29:55.400 --> 00:30:01.720]   TV device into an eye beacon so that my phone would have an awareness of, oh, I see that
[00:30:01.720 --> 00:30:05.840]   the eye beacon in the Apple TV is only eight feet away, so he's definitely in the living
[00:30:05.840 --> 00:30:06.840]   room.
[00:30:06.840 --> 00:30:10.400]   The phone could understand that, okay, if he's in the living room right now, he's definitely
[00:30:10.400 --> 00:30:16.040]   not in the car, so I should modify my behavior so that I can give this person the information
[00:30:16.040 --> 00:30:18.600]   and the tools that he wants if he's inside the living room.
[00:30:18.600 --> 00:30:19.600]   That's what I'm looking for.
[00:30:19.600 --> 00:30:21.680]   I'm looking for things like that that will enhance my life.
[00:30:21.680 --> 00:30:26.160]   If it's a business opportunity for Apple and an opportunity for marketing people to get
[00:30:26.160 --> 00:30:31.240]   even more fine-grained information as to who I am and why I stopped at a lingerie display
[00:30:31.240 --> 00:30:35.520]   for 8.5 seconds, my phone rang, I answered the phone, I happened to be in front of a
[00:30:35.520 --> 00:30:36.760]   display on Lacey Panties.
[00:30:36.760 --> 00:30:40.880]   I'm not interested in Panties or at least not in that context, I'm telling you.
[00:30:40.880 --> 00:30:43.400]   If that's really the purpose of eye beacons, who cares?
[00:30:43.400 --> 00:30:44.400]   That's stupid.
[00:30:44.400 --> 00:30:45.840]   I think it's much deeper than that.
[00:30:45.840 --> 00:30:49.640]   And by the way, why do I see did point out in the chatroom that while, you know, Bluetooth
[00:30:49.640 --> 00:30:54.960]   L.E. is a standard that eye beacon was really a set of API calls on iOS devices that give
[00:30:54.960 --> 00:30:56.440]   you a lot more capability.
[00:30:56.440 --> 00:30:58.280]   You'd have to write it by hand.
[00:30:58.280 --> 00:31:02.400]   Qualcomm has something called gimbal, which is the same idea.
[00:31:02.400 --> 00:31:04.200]   I think there'll be a lot of things using this.
[00:31:04.200 --> 00:31:08.480]   I think the big challenge for everybody else is going to be getting everybody else collected.
[00:31:08.480 --> 00:31:12.680]   I think Apple has the advantage that it has potentially 250 million devices that can
[00:31:12.680 --> 00:31:13.680]   already work with it.
[00:31:13.680 --> 00:31:14.680]   That's what blows me away.
[00:31:14.680 --> 00:31:15.680]   Yes.
[00:31:15.680 --> 00:31:17.680]   And they didn't, I mean, they snuck that in.
[00:31:17.680 --> 00:31:18.680]   Right.
[00:31:18.680 --> 00:31:19.680]   Yeah.
[00:31:19.680 --> 00:31:22.320]   And so I think that a lot of them will watch Apple and when Apple says, "We're going to
[00:31:22.320 --> 00:31:25.200]   go do this," everyone else starts to try to do it.
[00:31:25.200 --> 00:31:27.920]   And what Apple did is did something without telling anyone they were doing it.
[00:31:27.920 --> 00:31:30.800]   And so now they have a lot of penetration.
[00:31:30.800 --> 00:31:35.560]   And so it's not really 50/50 of who you're going to serve in a mall.
[00:31:35.560 --> 00:31:40.240]   You could do it today in the mall with the Apple technology or you can do it in a year
[00:31:40.240 --> 00:31:43.080]   or two years with some other technology.
[00:31:43.080 --> 00:31:51.200]   And I mean, the reality is on almost any measurement system, Apple consumers tend to
[00:31:51.200 --> 00:31:52.200]   spend more money.
[00:31:52.200 --> 00:31:56.200]   They tend to use their devices more.
[00:31:56.200 --> 00:32:00.200]   So I mean, I think that's shown in almost everything that every time someone studies
[00:32:00.200 --> 00:32:03.480]   something, they're on there, they use the net more, they spend more money, they do all
[00:32:03.480 --> 00:32:04.480]   those other things.
[00:32:04.480 --> 00:32:07.520]   So if you're going to pick half to half, you're going to pick the one that works on
[00:32:07.520 --> 00:32:08.640]   the iPhone, I think.
[00:32:08.640 --> 00:32:12.520]   And I think that the, but I think that the, you know, it's fine for, I think the consumer
[00:32:12.520 --> 00:32:16.000]   stuff is going to take a long time and people are going to screw it up by trying to make
[00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:17.960]   it to consumer.
[00:32:17.960 --> 00:32:22.240]   Whereas I think that a lot of basic stuff, like literally I need to find something, some
[00:32:22.240 --> 00:32:25.680]   of these giant malls, you walk into a Westfield mall and it takes me, you know, 15 minutes
[00:32:25.680 --> 00:32:28.400]   to figure out where the gap is, you know, or whatever.
[00:32:28.400 --> 00:32:31.600]   And being able to have GPS essentially in the mall.
[00:32:31.600 --> 00:32:37.440]   And by the way, tells me, you know, what's on sale as I walk by, you know, if I want
[00:32:37.440 --> 00:32:40.600]   to know that, you know, if I'm walking by Eddie Bauer, I usually want to know what's
[00:32:40.600 --> 00:32:41.600]   on sale.
[00:32:41.600 --> 00:32:45.280]   So I think there's a, if we focus too much on commerce, we might miss a lot of the
[00:32:45.280 --> 00:32:46.280]   thing.
[00:32:46.280 --> 00:32:47.280]   Oh, yeah.
[00:32:47.280 --> 00:32:48.280]   Absolutely.
[00:32:48.280 --> 00:32:51.400]   And of course, if Apple, all Apple does is make this as Mike calls it in his, they
[00:32:51.400 --> 00:32:55.320]   call it a Mac column, a digital clippy.
[00:32:55.320 --> 00:32:56.680]   This is, I'm going to find my phone.
[00:32:56.680 --> 00:32:59.640]   I see you're shopping for, would you like some help?
[00:32:59.640 --> 00:33:01.320]   That's not, I think that's annoying.
[00:33:01.320 --> 00:33:04.840]   I don't even know if that's something anybody, as you say, Andy, anybody wants that.
[00:33:04.840 --> 00:33:08.480]   But imagine walking up to your door and it opens for you because it's because the quickset
[00:33:08.480 --> 00:33:09.920]   locks are Ibekin, right?
[00:33:09.920 --> 00:33:12.080]   I know where my controller is because now I know.
[00:33:12.080 --> 00:33:13.080]   Right.
[00:33:13.080 --> 00:33:15.080]   Because it's got something attached to it.
[00:33:15.080 --> 00:33:17.640]   In Canada, I can't remember the last time I actually used a vehicle.
[00:33:17.640 --> 00:33:20.600]   We have NFC and our car, our Visa cards for three or four years.
[00:33:20.600 --> 00:33:21.880]   I tap for my gas.
[00:33:21.880 --> 00:33:23.120]   I tap to pay for my food.
[00:33:23.120 --> 00:33:25.120]   I tap to pay for my groceries.
[00:33:25.120 --> 00:33:28.360]   And Apple didn't use NFC because to them it was a chipset and not a feature set and
[00:33:28.360 --> 00:33:30.560]   they're going to use Ibekin instead.
[00:33:30.560 --> 00:33:33.920]   But it's interesting to see, you know, I think half the time there's chess moves that they're
[00:33:33.920 --> 00:33:38.440]   making that are exposed to go someplace and the other half it's serendipitous because they
[00:33:38.440 --> 00:33:42.480]   see how the other pieces are moving and things, you know, they make the sort of the same kind
[00:33:42.480 --> 00:33:44.400]   of realizations that we do.
[00:33:44.400 --> 00:33:48.800]   And if you look at the evolution of the iPhone, it's had sensors since the beginning.
[00:33:48.800 --> 00:33:50.840]   It could know its orientation.
[00:33:50.840 --> 00:33:52.240]   It could know ambient light.
[00:33:52.240 --> 00:33:53.240]   And they've been adding to that.
[00:33:53.240 --> 00:33:54.240]   It got GPS.
[00:33:54.240 --> 00:33:56.320]   It got, you know, rotation around gravity.
[00:33:56.320 --> 00:33:59.440]   Siri made a microphone go from something you just talked into to something and I could
[00:33:59.440 --> 00:34:01.240]   have a conversation with you.
[00:34:01.240 --> 00:34:04.720]   They've bought the sensor company for visual sensing.
[00:34:04.720 --> 00:34:06.920]   So maybe the eyesight camera will get smarter.
[00:34:06.920 --> 00:34:10.080]   Touch ID made the home button, not just a clicking thing, but something that can actually
[00:34:10.080 --> 00:34:11.640]   read biometrics.
[00:34:11.640 --> 00:34:15.000]   And if you start adding I beak into it, the iPhone knew where it was, but now it has an
[00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:17.560]   interactive relationship with where it is.
[00:34:17.560 --> 00:34:19.440]   So it starts to understand its environment.
[00:34:19.440 --> 00:34:20.760]   It starts to understand us.
[00:34:20.760 --> 00:34:22.680]   And I think it goes way beyond commerce.
[00:34:22.680 --> 00:34:26.520]   I'm sure we'll see commerce implementations because those are sort of obvious and they
[00:34:26.520 --> 00:34:28.880]   make money so they'll be well funded.
[00:34:28.880 --> 00:34:32.640]   But I think exactly what everyone here has been saying that it'll be, you know, your
[00:34:32.640 --> 00:34:34.680]   parking, there's a free parking spot.
[00:34:34.680 --> 00:34:37.560]   If you advance your car this way, we'll guide you to it.
[00:34:37.560 --> 00:34:39.240]   The meeting at the office is up here.
[00:34:39.240 --> 00:34:41.120]   Oh, by the way, your blood sugar is low.
[00:34:41.120 --> 00:34:42.120]   It's a vending machine.
[00:34:42.120 --> 00:34:44.160]   We'll do a transaction and give you a cookie bar.
[00:34:44.160 --> 00:34:45.160]   You know, right now there's so-
[00:34:45.160 --> 00:34:46.400]   And now having an I beacon catheter.
[00:34:46.400 --> 00:34:48.640]   It's just that happening right now.
[00:34:48.640 --> 00:34:49.640]   And I see you.
[00:34:49.640 --> 00:34:51.640]   I know you're more complacent in Canada.
[00:34:51.640 --> 00:34:54.680]   And there's just so many ways that it can become, that the device itself can go from
[00:34:54.680 --> 00:34:56.760]   being dumb to being truly smart and aware.
[00:34:56.760 --> 00:34:58.240]   Well, and imagine being in a conference.
[00:34:58.240 --> 00:35:01.880]   I mean, a lot of us are going to go to CES or NAB or whatever and say, I'm, look, show
[00:35:01.880 --> 00:35:05.200]   me where all the devices that like show me where all the TVs are.
[00:35:05.200 --> 00:35:06.200]   Amazing for whatever.
[00:35:06.200 --> 00:35:08.840]   And so it shows me a map of here's where they all are.
[00:35:08.840 --> 00:35:09.840]   Okay.
[00:35:09.840 --> 00:35:13.600]   And I'm here and now I'm no longer wandering through the South Hall trying to figure out
[00:35:13.600 --> 00:35:17.200]   something that was in the central hall or, you know, and it could create a tour.
[00:35:17.200 --> 00:35:18.200]   It could create a tour.
[00:35:18.200 --> 00:35:23.680]   Like I want to see a tour of all the, I want to see a tour of all the cameras at NAB and
[00:35:23.680 --> 00:35:29.320]   it could generate a tour, you know, and give me turn by turn directions within the, you
[00:35:29.320 --> 00:35:30.800]   know, the Las Vegas Convention Center.
[00:35:30.800 --> 00:35:32.200]   Those are the kinds of things that are possible.
[00:35:32.200 --> 00:35:37.000]   I just think that the next really big transformative experience for users is going to be context
[00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:38.000]   awareness.
[00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:39.200]   It really is going to be.
[00:35:39.200 --> 00:35:42.360]   I'm not going to, when I wake up my phone, I don't, I'm not going to necessarily see
[00:35:42.360 --> 00:35:45.920]   the same thing I saw three hours ago because it's going to understand that it's being,
[00:35:45.920 --> 00:35:48.360]   it's in a new place or even just a new context.
[00:35:48.360 --> 00:35:51.000]   And so that technology is a big help for that sort of thing.
[00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:56.880]   My sole area of real skepticism here is that do, this is the sort of thing that only works
[00:35:56.880 --> 00:36:00.560]   if everybody really gets on board the same thing at the same time.
[00:36:00.560 --> 00:36:04.960]   Apple, sometimes they introduce a technology that they introduce very, very strong and
[00:36:04.960 --> 00:36:08.240]   then it just doesn't work as well as they wanted to and they will maintain it, but not
[00:36:08.240 --> 00:36:15.320]   really, really emphatically support and, and, and, and, and, and this will still be a technology
[00:36:15.320 --> 00:36:18.240]   that is just for the kids in the Apple pool.
[00:36:18.240 --> 00:36:23.880]   I really think that this is a situation where if Apple really wanted to have a positive impact,
[00:36:23.880 --> 00:36:26.520]   they would, they would essentially say, here is our standard.
[00:36:26.520 --> 00:36:29.200]   We have developed it in consortium with these four other people.
[00:36:29.200 --> 00:36:32.320]   And so we're going to be the first ones to do it because we have the, we're the only
[00:36:32.320 --> 00:36:37.520]   company with the ability to do a rollout in mobile desktop operating system, application
[00:36:37.520 --> 00:36:40.480]   software and retail at the same time.
[00:36:40.480 --> 00:36:44.480]   But over the after people see how well this, this open technology works in the Apple stores
[00:36:44.480 --> 00:36:47.320]   and with our devices, you're going to see them on Android, you're going to see them in the
[00:36:47.320 --> 00:36:50.120]   museums, you're going to see them on, on, on roads.
[00:36:50.120 --> 00:36:52.320]   I mean, things, just things like roadside assistance.
[00:36:52.320 --> 00:36:58.000]   They're, if you can put cheap $5 chips inside, whatever little service item has to go into
[00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:02.320]   the highway so that when you do break down, your phone knows exactly what exits your next
[00:37:02.320 --> 00:37:07.080]   to not within, excuse me, what, what part of the road you're, you're, you're, you're at
[00:37:07.080 --> 00:37:09.040]   so that service field has confined you.
[00:37:09.040 --> 00:37:12.520]   Or if you don't sort of tumble off the road a little bit, it's better that they don't
[00:37:12.520 --> 00:37:14.440]   know within 60 yards if they know within a couple yards.
[00:37:14.440 --> 00:37:19.920]   So that's my, that's my primary non objective, a qualm about it that if Apple said this is
[00:37:19.920 --> 00:37:24.920]   an open standard and everybody's free to use it, I'd be 110% enthusiastic about it.
[00:37:24.920 --> 00:37:26.680]   As is it's okay.
[00:37:26.680 --> 00:37:31.320]   Nice news for people who have iPhones, nice news for stores and other places at the side,
[00:37:31.320 --> 00:37:34.920]   they want to support something that's iPhone only, which is not going to be a small percentage
[00:37:34.920 --> 00:37:40.000]   of the people of the groups out there, but it's not as exciting a piece of information
[00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:41.000]   news as it could be.
[00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:42.000]   And I don't.
[00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:44.920]   So they could add others, like if someone does come up with a standard or Google has
[00:37:44.920 --> 00:37:48.080]   a computer, like I like the fact that there's, there could be competition, Google could
[00:37:48.080 --> 00:37:52.160]   give out free dongles and every Chromecast and it could be, yeah, there could be a fan
[00:37:52.160 --> 00:37:55.080]   and then maybe eventually a standard will come up and because it's all software, Google
[00:37:55.080 --> 00:37:57.760]   could add it and Apple could add it and then we'll end up getting the best of all these
[00:37:57.760 --> 00:37:58.760]   bright minds.
[00:37:58.760 --> 00:38:02.160]   Well, and I don't, I don't know if Apple needs to make it open source or open, an open
[00:38:02.160 --> 00:38:07.360]   standard, but I do think that it would behoove them to invest in the rollout.
[00:38:07.360 --> 00:38:12.080]   So I think that they, you know, the, what Apple I think does a lot is they'll introduce
[00:38:12.080 --> 00:38:14.720]   something and some of the stuff takes off and Apple doesn't expect everyone else to
[00:38:14.720 --> 00:38:15.720]   jump on it.
[00:38:15.720 --> 00:38:18.720]   You know, they'll, and it's nice that at least that they're using it in their, in their own
[00:38:18.720 --> 00:38:23.600]   stores, but they should be like working, for instance, with a few, a few key museums to
[00:38:23.600 --> 00:38:28.960]   really build out a showcase of what this can do rather than wait for people to invest.
[00:38:28.960 --> 00:38:29.960]   You know, Apple's got the money.
[00:38:29.960 --> 00:38:33.680]   They, you know, they're doing buybacks and then spend a billion dollars, literally spend
[00:38:33.680 --> 00:38:40.240]   a billion dollars on Ibekin to, to develop, you know, ideas around, let's say Gettysburg
[00:38:40.240 --> 00:38:46.680]   or around, you know, a, you know, a great art museum or, you know, or all the above to
[00:38:46.680 --> 00:38:52.040]   really show that we're a great mall to show what you can do with it and get people excited
[00:38:52.040 --> 00:38:53.040]   about it.
[00:38:53.040 --> 00:38:56.080]   But what Apple will do or what is possible is Apple will, you know, release it, they'll
[00:38:56.080 --> 00:38:59.840]   do it in their own store and they'll expect everyone else to, you know, think that it's
[00:38:59.840 --> 00:39:02.920]   great and be willing to spend a million dollars on making it work.
[00:39:02.920 --> 00:39:06.920]   And I think that that's the, that's where this ends up turning into kind of a, that's
[00:39:06.920 --> 00:39:10.440]   what Andy saying is it, you know, it is an Apple only solution.
[00:39:10.440 --> 00:39:11.440]   It's not, it's not enough.
[00:39:11.440 --> 00:39:15.600]   I think I think if it's an Apple only solution, an Apple put real money into developing proof
[00:39:15.600 --> 00:39:16.600]   of concepts.
[00:39:16.600 --> 00:39:21.240]   They, you know, in the same way with iBooks, iBooks could have could, you know, run,
[00:39:21.240 --> 00:39:24.840]   you know, run eBooks, you know, traditional eBooks into the ground if Apple had really
[00:39:24.840 --> 00:39:29.120]   invested in, in the iBook author and really invested in producing lots and lots of great
[00:39:29.120 --> 00:39:30.120]   books.
[00:39:30.120 --> 00:39:31.120]   I book authors are very good.
[00:39:31.120 --> 00:39:32.120]   It's good.
[00:39:32.120 --> 00:39:33.120]   You know, it's good.
[00:39:33.120 --> 00:39:35.200]   But, but if Apple really put money behind that and really pushed it, they could have
[00:39:35.200 --> 00:39:39.720]   made, they could have made eBooks, you know, where Apple could really, or newsstand, you
[00:39:39.720 --> 00:39:42.400]   know, where Apple has very good relationship with Disney.
[00:39:42.400 --> 00:39:44.160]   What if they put this in all the Disney?
[00:39:44.160 --> 00:39:45.760]   Did you see my, did you see my post this morning?
[00:39:45.760 --> 00:39:46.760]   No.
[00:39:46.760 --> 00:39:49.560]   I was reposing like instead of doing buybacks, what Apple should do is buy Disney.
[00:39:49.560 --> 00:39:50.560]   Right.
[00:39:50.560 --> 00:39:52.440]   Well, they kind of have to do a relationship with it.
[00:39:52.440 --> 00:39:53.440]   They could do it with cash.
[00:39:53.440 --> 00:39:54.440]   Yeah.
[00:39:54.440 --> 00:39:56.640]   The thing is, is that Disney's worth about $125 billion.
[00:39:56.640 --> 00:39:59.840]   And I posted this on my G plus thing is that I think that Apple,
[00:39:59.840 --> 00:40:01.040]   Well, it's like it's side trip.
[00:40:01.040 --> 00:40:03.280]   But, but I think they should buy Disney because they could buy Disney.
[00:40:03.280 --> 00:40:07.840]   No, but look at all these, I, I look at what I, I beacon does to Disney park and look at
[00:40:07.840 --> 00:40:10.840]   what I do think there's pressure on Apple to do something with a hundred.
[00:40:10.840 --> 00:40:11.840]   Oh, great.
[00:40:11.840 --> 00:40:12.840]   So now Apple has their own proprietary.
[00:40:12.840 --> 00:40:15.240]   You have to have an iPhone to use this amusement bar.
[00:40:15.240 --> 00:40:17.240]   It's a nice thing about Apple.
[00:40:17.240 --> 00:40:18.240]   It's a nice thing about Apple.
[00:40:18.240 --> 00:40:22.280]   It's a nice thing about Apple is their ability, like their speed to market.
[00:40:22.280 --> 00:40:25.080]   The Phil Schiller feels that his house is two degrees too cold.
[00:40:25.080 --> 00:40:28.220]   iOS can have a solution for that in a year where a lot of other companies would have
[00:40:28.220 --> 00:40:32.200]   multiple levels of management and product roadmaps and things, you know, to get in the
[00:40:32.200 --> 00:40:33.200]   way.
[00:40:33.200 --> 00:40:35.000]   So yeah, there are stuff like iBooks and newsstands.
[00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:36.800]   Face time supposed to be open.
[00:40:36.800 --> 00:40:37.800]   Never was.
[00:40:37.800 --> 00:40:41.440]   There's a lot of things that don't get the, they don't get the continued attention they
[00:40:41.440 --> 00:40:44.840]   need, but they at least they get a jumpstart and a chance at the market because of the way
[00:40:44.840 --> 00:40:46.320]   Apple is structured.
[00:40:46.320 --> 00:40:47.880]   Where, what does this do to NFC?
[00:40:47.880 --> 00:40:50.320]   It seems to me this is an HD DVD moment for NFC.
[00:40:50.320 --> 00:40:51.320]   Where is that?
[00:40:51.320 --> 00:40:55.520]   Where, yeah, I mean, it seems to, we wondered why Apple didn't include NFC in its phones.
[00:40:55.520 --> 00:40:58.800]   Now, you know, I mean, everybody else, you might say an IBC can win.
[00:40:58.800 --> 00:41:00.400]   NFC, you have to touch something, right?
[00:41:00.400 --> 00:41:04.120]   I'm not saying I beacon will win, but I'm saying that that Bluetooth, Elie will win
[00:41:04.120 --> 00:41:06.120]   and NFC is dead.
[00:41:06.120 --> 00:41:12.400]   Would, would, the one thing, okay, I'm not, what, what if the reason NFC has a chance
[00:41:12.400 --> 00:41:13.400]   is for privacy?
[00:41:13.400 --> 00:41:17.480]   Because you have to be much more explicit with NFC, you have to touch something.
[00:41:17.480 --> 00:41:18.760]   Andy, what are you going to say?
[00:41:18.760 --> 00:41:23.640]   I was going to say NFC is a basic technology that does a hundred things really, really
[00:41:23.640 --> 00:41:24.640]   well.
[00:41:24.640 --> 00:41:28.680]   I've got, I've got a bunch of Bluetooth speakers here that on my iPhone, I have to tap, tap,
[00:41:28.680 --> 00:41:34.040]   tap, tap, tap, listen, tap, tap, tap to get it to work on, if I have an NFC phone, all
[00:41:34.040 --> 00:41:37.680]   I have to do is just tap it onto the top of the speaker, it establishes connection, establishes
[00:41:37.680 --> 00:41:39.400]   the Bluetooth and it's working immediately.
[00:41:39.400 --> 00:41:40.400]   Amazing.
[00:41:40.400 --> 00:41:42.120]   And there's, and that's just one, that's just one example.
[00:41:42.120 --> 00:41:43.920]   It's not just for electronic payments.
[00:41:43.920 --> 00:41:47.080]   That's not just for checking in here specifically where I am.
[00:41:47.080 --> 00:41:51.000]   I've just tapped this at the sticker that I put on this door jam and I've also told my
[00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:53.080]   system exactly where the sticker is.
[00:41:53.080 --> 00:41:54.920]   It's not just for that, it's for a million different things.
[00:41:54.920 --> 00:42:00.520]   And also, Leo, when you do, you do make that point, there's another difficulty that a technology
[00:42:00.520 --> 00:42:05.160]   like I, Beacons, is going to have is that we are, the incoming generation of tech users
[00:42:05.160 --> 00:42:07.480]   are not the same as, as our generation.
[00:42:07.480 --> 00:42:13.920]   They, they're, they have a better understanding of exactly the problems of privacy.
[00:42:13.920 --> 00:42:17.000]   They're getting, they're, they're a little bit less trustful of these companies that
[00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:20.320]   they didn't actually grow up, excuse me, that they didn't grow up with.
[00:42:20.320 --> 00:42:24.360]   They were, they're, Apple is the already the behemoth huge technology company when they
[00:42:24.360 --> 00:42:27.960]   were, when they bought their first, when they bought their first iPhones.
[00:42:27.960 --> 00:42:34.040]   And I would be concerned about a technology where if I walk through, it's just always,
[00:42:34.040 --> 00:42:36.880]   always, always collecting data off my phone.
[00:42:36.880 --> 00:42:38.120]   I do, I do have faith in Apple.
[00:42:38.120 --> 00:42:43.040]   I do think that they, they've, in the past, they've, they've shown a lot of respect for
[00:42:43.040 --> 00:42:43.880]   personal privacy.
[00:42:43.880 --> 00:42:47.760]   I'm sure there's going to be a switch somewhere in settings where you can say, do not broadcast
[00:42:47.760 --> 00:42:50.120]   my locations unless I give permission to.
[00:42:50.120 --> 00:42:54.600]   But I also think that this whole system won't work as well as it will in the commercials,
[00:42:54.600 --> 00:42:58.800]   unless you do say, yeah, by all means, let stores track me as I go throughout those places.
[00:42:58.800 --> 00:43:00.320]   So I'm not, I don't believe it's it.
[00:43:00.320 --> 00:43:03.440]   It's an NFC versus Bluetooth LE thing.
[00:43:03.440 --> 00:43:08.000]   These are both the technologies that cost next to nothing to put inside a device that
[00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:11.880]   take all next to no power in putting in there.
[00:43:11.880 --> 00:43:15.760]   So really, my idea of the ideal is a phone that does do Bluetooth LE, which is pretty
[00:43:15.760 --> 00:43:19.560]   much all of them, and also does do NFC, which is pretty much all of them, except for the
[00:43:19.560 --> 00:43:20.560]   iPhone.
[00:43:20.560 --> 00:43:21.560]   Yeah.
[00:43:21.560 --> 00:43:26.400]   I mean, I, I, the speaker example, I, even better, isn't it?
[00:43:26.400 --> 00:43:30.360]   If the speaker is I beacon enabled and as soon as you're within range of the speaker,
[00:43:30.360 --> 00:43:33.080]   it knows you're there and you can send anything to it.
[00:43:33.080 --> 00:43:35.000]   No tapping involved, no pairing involved.
[00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:38.440]   Yeah, those are chipsets and Apple usually focuses on feature sets and you know, maybe
[00:43:38.440 --> 00:43:40.520]   one day they'll put NFC in because it solves a problem.
[00:43:40.520 --> 00:43:43.760]   You can't solve with anything else, but in less than until I beacon could do it that
[00:43:43.760 --> 00:43:44.760]   moment.
[00:43:44.760 --> 00:43:45.760]   Yeah.
[00:43:45.760 --> 00:43:46.760]   If they don't need it, they won't use it.
[00:43:46.760 --> 00:43:48.000]   That's the typical method that they pull.
[00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:52.280]   But I think you guys are right to remind us of the historic precedent that Apple often
[00:43:52.280 --> 00:43:54.800]   comes up with something that is just, yeah.
[00:43:54.800 --> 00:43:56.360]   And then just doesn't.
[00:43:56.360 --> 00:44:01.120]   And I think as, I think as again, they have, they have so much money.
[00:44:01.120 --> 00:44:04.120]   Like, and I get that, you know, it's like, just spend some money on it.
[00:44:04.120 --> 00:44:05.120]   They don't have to do it internally.
[00:44:05.120 --> 00:44:06.280]   You know, there's companies to do that.
[00:44:06.280 --> 00:44:07.280]   I mean, but, but do.
[00:44:07.280 --> 00:44:12.380]   Apple's been holding on to this $150 billion cash like it's the end of the world, probably
[00:44:12.380 --> 00:44:16.360]   because they remember what happened the last time Steve was gone.
[00:44:16.360 --> 00:44:20.640]   And they got within a hundred days of their, of, I think, I think they're so focused on
[00:44:20.640 --> 00:44:21.640]   what they're doing.
[00:44:21.640 --> 00:44:22.640]   They just don't need it.
[00:44:22.640 --> 00:44:26.200]   So much pressure from Carl Icahn and I have to think many other investors to either to
[00:44:26.200 --> 00:44:27.200]   give us the money.
[00:44:27.200 --> 00:44:31.480]   If you got $150 billion, I can't say, give us money that maybe that pressure from shareholders
[00:44:31.480 --> 00:44:35.680]   will force Apple to buy something instead of giving them the money.
[00:44:35.680 --> 00:44:39.280]   I mean, I can't be pissed, but who cares about Cants Company?
[00:44:39.280 --> 00:44:40.280]   Yeah.
[00:44:40.280 --> 00:44:42.120]   I mean, that, that does put pressure.
[00:44:42.120 --> 00:44:45.960]   Apple has this great war chest, which they've done very little with.
[00:44:45.960 --> 00:44:47.600]   Buy Disney.
[00:44:47.600 --> 00:44:48.600]   How much is Disney worth?
[00:44:48.600 --> 00:44:49.600]   $125 billion.
[00:44:49.600 --> 00:44:51.160]   So it wouldn't have to buy it.
[00:44:51.160 --> 00:44:52.160]   But they wouldn't have to.
[00:44:52.160 --> 00:44:55.360]   No, you'd spend, you'd have to read $60, $70 billion plus stock.
[00:44:55.360 --> 00:44:56.520]   It'd be nothing.
[00:44:56.520 --> 00:44:57.520]   Repatriate.
[00:44:57.520 --> 00:44:58.520]   How about your own?
[00:44:58.520 --> 00:44:59.520]   Yeah, you're going to have to take it back.
[00:44:59.520 --> 00:45:00.520]   Not necessarily.
[00:45:00.520 --> 00:45:01.520]   They could buy your own Disney.
[00:45:01.520 --> 00:45:05.320]   Yeah, there's a lot of ways of moving that cash around.
[00:45:05.320 --> 00:45:10.400]   So the point is, is that they, you know, they would, doing something with the money would
[00:45:10.400 --> 00:45:13.280]   be, is the reason that everyone's asking for the money back is because they're not doing
[00:45:13.280 --> 00:45:14.280]   anything with it.
[00:45:14.280 --> 00:45:15.280]   And they could.
[00:45:15.280 --> 00:45:18.120]   Well, they want to get, everybody wants it is what it is.
[00:45:18.120 --> 00:45:19.840]   The shareholders say, well, give it to us.
[00:45:19.840 --> 00:45:20.840]   Right.
[00:45:20.840 --> 00:45:21.840]   It's just sitting in the pool.
[00:45:21.840 --> 00:45:24.200]   And that's silly because they're not doing anything with it, but they're not doing anything
[00:45:24.200 --> 00:45:25.440]   with it right now.
[00:45:25.440 --> 00:45:28.720]   That means in a year from now, when they have an opportunity to acquire a company that really
[00:45:28.720 --> 00:45:32.760]   is, spackles in the perfect hole they've got in the strategy that they're not going
[00:45:32.760 --> 00:45:34.480]   to move on for three, four years.
[00:45:34.480 --> 00:45:38.080]   They got the $280 million in the, in the banks that could just write that check.
[00:45:38.080 --> 00:45:39.080]   That's why Disney.
[00:45:39.080 --> 00:45:42.440]   That Carl Icahn is not, not known for his long term thinking, I think.
[00:45:42.440 --> 00:45:44.800]   Well, Apple's not a reactive company.
[00:45:44.800 --> 00:45:49.200]   I mean, whether it's coming from customers, a Carl Icahn or anybody else saying, you must
[00:45:49.200 --> 00:45:50.200]   do this.
[00:45:50.200 --> 00:45:54.720]   Apple doesn't listen to anybody pretty much except itself and say, no, we, we know exactly
[00:45:54.720 --> 00:45:55.720]   what we plan to do.
[00:45:55.720 --> 00:46:02.280]   He's got to feel pressure though from, from the, I suppose, but you know, are they, is
[00:46:02.280 --> 00:46:03.480]   that going to make a difference?
[00:46:03.480 --> 00:46:06.080]   Well, Tim Cooks had lunch a couple of times at Carl Icahn.
[00:46:06.080 --> 00:46:07.080]   He's not ignoring him.
[00:46:07.080 --> 00:46:11.800]   No, he's not ignoring him, but I don't think that he's, you know, he's saying the right
[00:46:11.800 --> 00:46:15.360]   words, but I'm sure that they're, why do you think the fact that they're doing a buyback?
[00:46:15.360 --> 00:46:16.920]   I mean, I think that buyback is a thing.
[00:46:16.920 --> 00:46:18.080]   It's the job sort of done.
[00:46:18.080 --> 00:46:19.080]   That's the compromise, right?
[00:46:19.080 --> 00:46:20.080]   Yeah.
[00:46:20.080 --> 00:46:21.080]   I mean, it's the buyback.
[00:46:21.080 --> 00:46:22.560]   I mean, and you do enough buybacks and then you don't have to buy back anything else.
[00:46:22.560 --> 00:46:23.560]   You don't have to listen to anybody.
[00:46:23.560 --> 00:46:24.560]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:46:24.560 --> 00:46:28.200]   So it's, I mean, I think that that can be, but I, I think that it would be interesting.
[00:46:28.200 --> 00:46:33.280]   Again, it's, I'm not saying that one, a billion dollars to get iBooks off the ground
[00:46:33.280 --> 00:46:35.680]   or to get iBeacon off the ground is just chicken feet.
[00:46:35.680 --> 00:46:39.680]   I'm just, I'm saying that that's the, that's my complaint is that they apple has something
[00:46:39.680 --> 00:46:42.880]   almost as valuable as a maybe more valuable and a hundred fifty billion dollars in the
[00:46:42.880 --> 00:46:43.880]   bank.
[00:46:43.880 --> 00:46:46.280]   They have half a billion credit card numbers.
[00:46:46.280 --> 00:46:49.680]   And every single iBeacon is tied to it.
[00:46:49.680 --> 00:46:50.680]   Right.
[00:46:50.680 --> 00:46:51.680]   Now.
[00:46:51.680 --> 00:46:53.280]   So there's some value to that.
[00:46:53.280 --> 00:46:54.080]   I mean, that's it.
[00:46:54.080 --> 00:46:55.580]   That's a pretty big ecosystem.
[00:46:55.580 --> 00:46:58.480]   There's a lot of stuff that they sit on until they don't.
[00:46:58.480 --> 00:47:01.960]   They're typical again, their typical method of doing things.
[00:47:01.960 --> 00:47:04.560]   And they only, I mean, you have tons of tons of money and to Alex's point, they could
[00:47:04.560 --> 00:47:08.200]   hire people, but typically they have a very small team and they run very lean and they
[00:47:08.200 --> 00:47:09.200]   only have it.
[00:47:09.200 --> 00:47:12.480]   It's like the eye of Sauron, you know, it's, it's this blinding burning light on a couple
[00:47:12.480 --> 00:47:16.160]   of projects and everything else ends up frozen in the dark for years.
[00:47:16.160 --> 00:47:19.360]   It's, you know, and good reference for day.
[00:47:19.360 --> 00:47:24.280]   Actually, it's not the first time the eye of Sauron has come up with the content.
[00:47:24.280 --> 00:47:27.720]   You used to be referred to as the Steve, the Steve eye.
[00:47:27.720 --> 00:47:32.720]   Yeah, and so.
[00:47:32.720 --> 00:47:35.720]   But no, I think that's absolutely true.
[00:47:35.720 --> 00:47:40.840]   And I think we, we, the, the, the, the chattering classes, the nattering classes forget that
[00:47:40.840 --> 00:47:47.320]   Apple's a company with, you know, constraints and business issues and so forth.
[00:47:47.320 --> 00:47:50.720]   And that internally probably looks very different than it looks externally.
[00:47:50.720 --> 00:47:54.840]   And also they don't, they don't control the whole world and that really, not that does,
[00:47:54.840 --> 00:47:56.320]   that does influence their decision.
[00:47:56.320 --> 00:47:59.440]   They don't control everything that every retailer, every public space and every user
[00:47:59.440 --> 00:48:01.080]   of every device wants to do.
[00:48:01.080 --> 00:48:07.000]   But, but I got to say, and I, and I'm going to quote your, your article today, Renee,
[00:48:07.000 --> 00:48:11.920]   in at imore.com, the contextual awakening, how sensors are making mobile truly brilliant,
[00:48:11.920 --> 00:48:18.000]   that this is, if we talk about the internet of things, this is a huge and sudden move
[00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:24.480]   on Apple to have 200 million plus things that suddenly just woke up.
[00:48:24.480 --> 00:48:25.480]   Right.
[00:48:25.480 --> 00:48:28.040]   Am I, am I overstating that?
[00:48:28.040 --> 00:48:32.760]   No, I mean, so they can understand the world around them a little bit.
[00:48:32.760 --> 00:48:33.760]   They're getting better with eye beacons.
[00:48:33.760 --> 00:48:37.120]   They can understand each other through networking and they're starting to understand us through
[00:48:37.120 --> 00:48:42.080]   things like Siri and, you know, potentially better eyesight cameras and touch ID.
[00:48:42.080 --> 00:48:45.600]   And when you start to be doing, when you start to be able to put those things together,
[00:48:45.600 --> 00:48:48.600]   depending on how comfortable we are with them, I mean, like out, Siri does not do what Google
[00:48:48.600 --> 00:48:52.440]   now does, but you know, conceivably it could at some point, as much as we're willing to
[00:48:52.440 --> 00:48:56.480]   trust them, they can start taking on these interactive tasks and they'll be very good
[00:48:56.480 --> 00:48:57.480]   at it.
[00:48:57.480 --> 00:49:00.680]   It's not sort of like, you know, Skynet or the Terminator where they become aware, but
[00:49:00.680 --> 00:49:05.760]   they give this sort of illusion of, of understanding and of sentience that I think is incredibly
[00:49:05.760 --> 00:49:09.760]   helpful if we let them do it.
[00:49:09.760 --> 00:49:18.160]   I feel like there's a huge opportunity and I wish some company would just say privacy
[00:49:18.160 --> 00:49:22.520]   be damned full speed ahead because I think people make noise about privacy, but when
[00:49:22.520 --> 00:49:26.280]   it comes down to convenience, you're going to opt for convenience and it's not going
[00:49:26.280 --> 00:49:27.280]   to do it.
[00:49:27.280 --> 00:49:29.040]   It's not forgotten more than Google and Facebook.
[00:49:29.040 --> 00:49:32.800]   I think they've pretty much Facebook's the privacy be damned guy, aren't they?
[00:49:32.800 --> 00:49:33.800]   Yeah.
[00:49:33.800 --> 00:49:35.200]   Even they back down.
[00:49:35.200 --> 00:49:39.880]   I mean, I, some of you should just be unapologetic and say, look, you don't have to plan our
[00:49:39.880 --> 00:49:41.680]   space, but we're going to take all your information.
[00:49:41.680 --> 00:49:43.560]   We're going to give you some stuff in return.
[00:49:43.560 --> 00:49:45.440]   And if you don't like it, don't do it.
[00:49:45.440 --> 00:49:46.440]   Even Eric Schmidt hates drones.
[00:49:46.440 --> 00:49:49.680]   I mean, there's a limit to every, I guess.
[00:49:49.680 --> 00:49:52.360]   But that does illustrate the point.
[00:49:52.360 --> 00:49:56.200]   One of the reasons why people are more comfortable with Google than Facebook is because Google
[00:49:56.200 --> 00:49:59.800]   delivers a hell of a lot of value for the information that they collect about you.
[00:49:59.800 --> 00:50:04.640]   Google now, it's an immediate, the first time that you have an Android phone and the first
[00:50:04.640 --> 00:50:08.920]   time you have a phone that has Google now and the first time more than anything else,
[00:50:08.920 --> 00:50:12.960]   you are in an airport and you just simply tap a button and without even attending to
[00:50:12.960 --> 00:50:16.760]   get information and says, oh, I understand that now that you're on your way to Atlanta.
[00:50:16.760 --> 00:50:17.920]   Here is your flight.
[00:50:17.920 --> 00:50:20.640]   It's 20 minutes late, but here's the gate is going to depart from.
[00:50:20.640 --> 00:50:24.080]   When you get there, the weather Atlanta is this here, the directions from the airport
[00:50:24.080 --> 00:50:25.840]   to the hotel that you booked.
[00:50:25.840 --> 00:50:29.920]   These all information that you decided to give to Google, that's something that immediately
[00:50:29.920 --> 00:50:32.720]   makes me think that, wow, okay, I got something back for this.
[00:50:32.720 --> 00:50:35.960]   This is a lot of information that I always, I would have to dip into 12 different apps
[00:50:35.960 --> 00:50:37.040]   to get.
[00:50:37.040 --> 00:50:41.600]   If it turns out that is just collecting information and there's no obvious benefit to me back
[00:50:41.600 --> 00:50:42.600]   at it.
[00:50:42.600 --> 00:50:46.880]   That's going to be the reason why I dip into settings and say, I beacon slash off.
[00:50:46.880 --> 00:50:48.240]   By the way, you can do, right?
[00:50:48.240 --> 00:50:52.200]   The answer to the privacy concern is, is it opt in or is, I think it is opt in.
[00:50:52.200 --> 00:50:53.480]   I think you have to turn it on.
[00:50:53.480 --> 00:50:56.160]   It's not just the privacy though, it's the fear and it's the same thing the car companies
[00:50:56.160 --> 00:50:59.080]   tell us when you say, you know, we could, we could be doing so much more than just parallel
[00:50:59.080 --> 00:51:01.960]   parking, but people are afraid of their cars driving them.
[00:51:01.960 --> 00:51:04.240]   So we have to do it step by step and feature by feature.
[00:51:04.240 --> 00:51:07.600]   And it's the same way Google now and Siri, they just keep adding services.
[00:51:07.600 --> 00:51:11.520]   They start small enough that we're comfortable and then they build towards, you know, they
[00:51:11.520 --> 00:51:15.140]   they, they bring us, they take us by the hand and lead us towards the future rather than
[00:51:15.140 --> 00:51:16.440]   just shoving us into the pool.
[00:51:16.440 --> 00:51:17.840]   I'm so ready to have my car drive.
[00:51:17.840 --> 00:51:20.360]   If I were an entrepreneur, that's all I got to say.
[00:51:20.360 --> 00:51:23.640]   And I would just gamble it all and say, look, we're going to be explicit.
[00:51:23.640 --> 00:51:26.920]   We're not going to hide this, but we're just going to take every bit of information you
[00:51:26.920 --> 00:51:27.920]   give us.
[00:51:27.920 --> 00:51:30.680]   We'll give you as every bit of value we can for it.
[00:51:30.680 --> 00:51:31.680]   I sound like Google.
[00:51:31.680 --> 00:51:33.160]   And you're going to have benefit out of it.
[00:51:33.160 --> 00:51:34.160]   Well, yeah.
[00:51:34.160 --> 00:51:36.240]   There's, unfortunately there's regulators.
[00:51:36.240 --> 00:51:37.240]   Gosh darn it.
[00:51:37.240 --> 00:51:39.560]   That's why Larry Page was living on an island.
[00:51:39.560 --> 00:51:41.280]   It's the same thing that happened with FaceTime.
[00:51:41.280 --> 00:51:42.800]   I mean, they got sued by patent trolls.
[00:51:42.800 --> 00:51:44.520]   And it's the same thing that happened with iBooks.
[00:51:44.520 --> 00:51:45.520]   They got oversight.
[00:51:45.520 --> 00:51:47.800]   I mean, like Andy said earlier, the world around us.
[00:51:47.800 --> 00:51:48.800]   It's darn over saying.
[00:51:48.800 --> 00:51:53.920]   Yeah, the world around us sometimes suppresses technology, sometimes well and sometimes unnecessarily,
[00:51:53.920 --> 00:51:55.760]   but they have to live in that world.
[00:51:55.760 --> 00:51:56.760]   Yeah.
[00:51:56.760 --> 00:52:00.000]   And the other thing is that we trust Google and Apple because we know that, they're,
[00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:04.840]   oh, them and the other like big tech companies had a full page ad in the New York Times saying,
[00:52:04.840 --> 00:52:07.880]   look, I don't, we're telling, there's an open letter to the government saying that
[00:52:07.880 --> 00:52:10.800]   we're going to do our best to protect our users' privacy.
[00:52:10.800 --> 00:52:13.800]   And if you keep knocking on our door and insisting on our users' privacy, we're going to make
[00:52:13.800 --> 00:52:18.680]   you tell us exactly why we legally are forced to do that.
[00:52:18.680 --> 00:52:22.160]   If Leo starts his own data collection company, I'm sure he can help us some really, really
[00:52:22.160 --> 00:52:24.600]   awesome benefits to my giving personal information.
[00:52:24.600 --> 00:52:28.480]   But, you know, the government is going to drive past the building.
[00:52:28.480 --> 00:52:34.600]   Note that, okay, he's got about a $32,000 car in the driveway, not at $800,000 car in
[00:52:34.600 --> 00:52:35.600]   the driveway.
[00:52:35.600 --> 00:52:38.000]   I bet that if we sue his butt, he'll just have to turn over.
[00:52:38.000 --> 00:52:41.120]   But I mean, I think we look at, we look at like the e-book.
[00:52:41.120 --> 00:52:44.640]   That's a guy with a cloth interior does not have a war chest to fight the United States
[00:52:44.640 --> 00:52:45.640]   government.
[00:52:45.640 --> 00:52:49.520]   Well, but I think that the iBooks e-books, you know, whole, whole issue and regulation
[00:52:49.520 --> 00:52:51.400]   is Apple playing small.
[00:52:51.400 --> 00:52:56.720]   What they did is they tried to play against a, you know, price, you know, rather than,
[00:52:56.720 --> 00:53:00.000]   we're going to create a whole new, a whole new sector, which is interactive books, you
[00:53:00.000 --> 00:53:02.760]   know, and we're going to, and we're going to use iBook author and we're going to keep
[00:53:02.760 --> 00:53:03.760]   on developing it.
[00:53:03.760 --> 00:53:04.760]   We're going to make it great.
[00:53:04.760 --> 00:53:08.800]   And I'm embarrassed to be looking at a 2D book, you know, within two or three years.
[00:53:08.800 --> 00:53:11.880]   But instead they, you know, they just tried to go for low hanging fruit and they got,
[00:53:11.880 --> 00:53:13.760]   you know, didn't work out.
[00:53:13.760 --> 00:53:15.120]   You know, and I think that you're not bitter.
[00:53:15.120 --> 00:53:16.120]   Well, I'm not bitter at all.
[00:53:16.120 --> 00:53:17.120]   I don't think I'm bitter at all.
[00:53:17.120 --> 00:53:18.480]   I'm just saying I'm a stupid.
[00:53:18.480 --> 00:53:19.800]   I mean, it was just, it was like, why?
[00:53:19.800 --> 00:53:22.080]   You were so excited when they announced iBooks author.
[00:53:22.080 --> 00:53:23.080]   No, I was.
[00:53:23.080 --> 00:53:24.080]   And you used it too, right?
[00:53:24.080 --> 00:53:25.080]   Oh, you used it.
[00:53:25.080 --> 00:53:26.080]   It's just, it's just limited.
[00:53:26.080 --> 00:53:28.760]   It's just hard to, you know, and you, and you, when you want to do anything complicated,
[00:53:28.760 --> 00:53:32.240]   you just realize they needed to keep on going, you know, and so you're now putting yourself
[00:53:32.240 --> 00:53:35.240]   into it and you don't know if they're ever going to move it forward in any significant
[00:53:35.240 --> 00:53:37.320]   way so you don't commit to it.
[00:53:37.320 --> 00:53:41.240]   You know, and so the thing is, is that, you know, the, the reality is, is that there's
[00:53:41.240 --> 00:53:46.560]   a, you know, the, the education, you know, the education industry and I don't mean K through
[00:53:46.560 --> 00:53:47.560]   12.
[00:53:47.560 --> 00:53:50.240]   I mean, everything, everything when we buy a car, we're going to expect an app.
[00:53:50.240 --> 00:53:52.400]   When we buy a new microwave, we're going to expect an app.
[00:53:52.400 --> 00:53:55.080]   We're going to expect an app and we walk into the hotel room and we're going to expect
[00:53:55.080 --> 00:53:58.520]   to get video training on everything, including K through 12.
[00:53:58.520 --> 00:54:01.880]   And it's, it's, it's a massive business that Apple's giving away.
[00:54:01.880 --> 00:54:02.880]   You know, and, because they have it.
[00:54:02.880 --> 00:54:06.880]   I mean, they, they could own that, that business and I beacon is a piece of that puzzle.
[00:54:06.880 --> 00:54:10.800]   And, but instead, you know, I just feel like, you know, like with ebooks, I mean, who cares?
[00:54:10.800 --> 00:54:11.800]   It's just, it's text.
[00:54:11.800 --> 00:54:16.120]   Well, well, you could, you know, so it's just, you know, like, like, it's, it's like
[00:54:16.120 --> 00:54:17.280]   so last century.
[00:54:17.280 --> 00:54:19.240]   Text is like last century, last morning.
[00:54:19.240 --> 00:54:22.240]   I mean, you know, I fortunately having now is people are rolling their own for the most
[00:54:22.240 --> 00:54:23.240]   part.
[00:54:23.240 --> 00:54:24.240]   They're making PDFs with video.
[00:54:24.240 --> 00:54:25.680]   Well, that's, well, that's great.
[00:54:25.680 --> 00:54:27.080]   That's exactly what we want.
[00:54:27.080 --> 00:54:31.560]   I mean, there, there's, there's, there are very, very few things that consistently make
[00:54:31.560 --> 00:54:33.880]   me roll my eyes about Apple announcements.
[00:54:33.880 --> 00:54:37.840]   And one is when they do what I believe is a very, very sincere spiel about the importance
[00:54:37.840 --> 00:54:41.880]   of education and how we need a new generation of textbooks.
[00:54:41.880 --> 00:54:44.880]   And then if this were like a one on one conversation, I'd say, Oh, that's great.
[00:54:44.880 --> 00:54:47.800]   And so you really want every school system to support this.
[00:54:47.800 --> 00:54:51.080]   So of course you're making this into a platform that everybody can use.
[00:54:51.080 --> 00:54:54.440]   No, we're going to insist that you have a Mac to author and then we're going to assist
[00:54:54.440 --> 00:54:56.440]   you have an iPad to read this sort of stuff.
[00:54:56.440 --> 00:54:59.840]   And even our iBooks app is not going to be cross platform because we really don't want
[00:54:59.840 --> 00:55:02.360]   anybody who doesn't have an Apple to have access to this.
[00:55:02.360 --> 00:55:05.960]   I mean, this is, this is why there's even, even now, I think we're kind of falling into
[00:55:05.960 --> 00:55:06.960]   that trap.
[00:55:06.960 --> 00:55:10.840]   We're talking, we're saying all these really wonderful things about iBeacons, which, which
[00:55:10.840 --> 00:55:13.480]   really are just things we're saying about Bluetooth, L.E.
[00:55:13.480 --> 00:55:18.000]   There's, I can't think of anything that we've talked about, about the potential of iBeacons
[00:55:18.000 --> 00:55:21.840]   that cannot be done with this phone right here that is not made by Apple.
[00:55:21.840 --> 00:55:25.840]   It is a simple, any device with Bluetooth, L.E. can do pretty much anything that was mentioned
[00:55:25.840 --> 00:55:26.840]   about that.
[00:55:26.840 --> 00:55:29.960]   And I think that I think kind of halfway in between is either Apple needs to decide to
[00:55:29.960 --> 00:55:35.880]   make it an open standard or they need to invest what it takes to turn it into the thing that
[00:55:35.880 --> 00:55:36.880]   everyone's using.
[00:55:36.880 --> 00:55:38.760]   And I don't think they do either very well.
[00:55:38.760 --> 00:55:41.720]   You know, like, so the thing is, is that if they, you know, if they want to keep it closed,
[00:55:41.720 --> 00:55:45.920]   then be ready to put their money where their mouth is into, you know, really invest billions
[00:55:45.920 --> 00:55:50.080]   of dollars in making it really work well, you know, and that's what they're not doing.
[00:55:50.080 --> 00:55:53.840]   If you want to change the world, change the world at not just the percentage of them that
[00:55:53.840 --> 00:55:55.440]   happen to buy your products.
[00:55:55.440 --> 00:55:58.240]   I think that they could just make it a positive of what Apple strategy is.
[00:55:58.240 --> 00:56:00.240]   I think they could leave it closed.
[00:56:00.240 --> 00:56:02.240]   And of course, they're a company and they have to do it.
[00:56:02.240 --> 00:56:04.160]   I think it's fine for them to leave it closed.
[00:56:04.160 --> 00:56:07.000]   I think that the main thing is, is they just, if they're going to leave it closed, they
[00:56:07.000 --> 00:56:10.600]   need to spend real money behind every time they release something to sell it.
[00:56:10.600 --> 00:56:12.040]   It's not going to always sell itself.
[00:56:12.040 --> 00:56:15.360]   I think that's the, that's the issue is that they believe control, control, experience,
[00:56:15.360 --> 00:56:17.560]   which is really important to them.
[00:56:17.560 --> 00:56:19.320]   They believe, say that again, they believe control.
[00:56:19.320 --> 00:56:22.320]   They believe that they keep it closed because they want to control the experience.
[00:56:22.320 --> 00:56:26.800]   Like if it's end to end Apple, they can ensure exactly what you're going to get delivered
[00:56:26.800 --> 00:56:29.000]   when you have that Ibikin and you have that tour.
[00:56:29.000 --> 00:56:30.000]   It's a philosophy.
[00:56:30.000 --> 00:56:34.400]   And they feel incredible pain when like the AT&T network goes down or FedEx can't deliver
[00:56:34.400 --> 00:56:35.400]   the iPad on time.
[00:56:35.400 --> 00:56:36.880]   Because they have no control over that.
[00:56:36.880 --> 00:56:37.880]   Yeah.
[00:56:37.880 --> 00:56:40.920]   Boy, that's, and that's comes right from Steve Jobs psychology probably.
[00:56:40.920 --> 00:56:41.920]   Yeah.
[00:56:41.920 --> 00:56:42.920]   And again, I don't think it's a problem.
[00:56:42.920 --> 00:56:46.000]   I think it's just that they need to take out of the hundreds of billions that they have.
[00:56:46.000 --> 00:56:48.320]   They need to take, you know, some billions.
[00:56:48.320 --> 00:56:50.080]   And can you jumpstart something?
[00:56:50.080 --> 00:56:51.080]   Oh, yeah.
[00:56:51.080 --> 00:56:52.840]   It's been a few billions and that will make it happen.
[00:56:52.840 --> 00:56:53.840]   Yeah.
[00:56:53.840 --> 00:56:54.840]   I don't know.
[00:56:54.840 --> 00:56:58.400]   I see that you see that happen with industries all the time where they try to make a standard
[00:56:58.400 --> 00:56:59.560]   and they can't, you know.
[00:56:59.560 --> 00:57:02.880]   Why don't they, you know, again, I think that, you know, I think that there's, Apple
[00:57:02.880 --> 00:57:05.360]   has an enormous amount of, they already have the penetration.
[00:57:05.360 --> 00:57:07.240]   They already have income.
[00:57:07.240 --> 00:57:09.320]   They already have an enormous amount of cash.
[00:57:09.320 --> 00:57:11.400]   They have a lot of things going for themselves.
[00:57:11.400 --> 00:57:15.400]   You know, and so the thing is, is the ability to invest especially into something new.
[00:57:15.400 --> 00:57:20.960]   There's a lot of, you know, it's harder if they leverage an existing market that, and
[00:57:20.960 --> 00:57:24.600]   not change anything because look at an antitrust, which is where they got themselves into with
[00:57:24.600 --> 00:57:25.600]   the eBooks.
[00:57:25.600 --> 00:57:29.200]   But if they create something completely different and then use an enormous amount of force to
[00:57:29.200 --> 00:57:32.520]   push it forward, I think that they have a lot of other opportunities.
[00:57:32.520 --> 00:57:36.560]   And they're not, and it's not like they create something out of, out of nowhere.
[00:57:36.560 --> 00:57:41.320]   You know, the interactive world is coming very quickly and, you know, they're just not,
[00:57:41.320 --> 00:57:42.400]   they could own it.
[00:57:42.400 --> 00:57:43.400]   You know, and they're not.
[00:57:43.400 --> 00:57:46.920]   I think part, the problem is that they have uncooperative partners when you're talking
[00:57:46.920 --> 00:57:48.760]   about entertainment or even how about eText.
[00:57:48.760 --> 00:57:52.080]   But that's why, but that's, that's my argument of why you buy, you buy Disney and then you
[00:57:52.080 --> 00:57:54.080]   just show people what you could do with that.
[00:57:54.080 --> 00:57:58.080]   Well, yeah, but they also have to buy Pearson and do they have by Harper Collins and well,
[00:57:58.080 --> 00:58:01.680]   I mean, specifically when we talk about eText books, because this is something I'm dealing
[00:58:01.680 --> 00:58:06.600]   with my daughter, where she's carrying around 80 pounds of books on her 12 year old shoulders,
[00:58:06.600 --> 00:58:07.600]   which is silly.
[00:58:07.600 --> 00:58:11.240]   And I talked to the school and say, why don't they kick in a ebook version of this?
[00:58:11.240 --> 00:58:13.080]   I don't even care if it's interactive.
[00:58:13.080 --> 00:58:15.080]   If it could just go on a Kindle, I'd be happy about it.
[00:58:15.080 --> 00:58:18.180]   But they just say, well, you know, the textbook companies don't offer that kind of bargain
[00:58:18.180 --> 00:58:20.720]   because they want you to buy the paper.
[00:58:20.720 --> 00:58:22.480]   They want you to spend the 60 bucks on the paper.
[00:58:22.480 --> 00:58:24.480]   Well, they're all, they're all, all the text.
[00:58:24.480 --> 00:58:25.480]   We 60s.
[00:58:25.480 --> 00:58:26.480]   Nothing, Chris.
[00:58:26.480 --> 00:58:30.160]   We, we, we, we, we, we, we just got kids, we're the college.
[00:58:30.160 --> 00:58:33.400]   All the tech companies are spending money on interactive.
[00:58:33.400 --> 00:58:35.400]   I mean, they know it's, they know paper is going out.
[00:58:35.400 --> 00:58:39.120]   I mean, so all the half of them, half of them, Flynn and Pearson, they're all spending
[00:58:39.120 --> 00:58:40.280]   a lot of money on R&D.
[00:58:40.280 --> 00:58:42.480]   The reality is they don't know it well enough.
[00:58:42.480 --> 00:58:47.680]   It doesn't help Apple to get that because the raw content could be recreated, you know,
[00:58:47.680 --> 00:58:51.240]   and they, they're not going to, you know, they don't need that.
[00:58:51.240 --> 00:58:54.360]   I mean, if you had, if I had a break, I need to take a break.
[00:58:54.360 --> 00:58:59.480]   But when we come back Siri and your living room, possibly it's already in your Honda
[00:58:59.480 --> 00:59:04.920]   and some, an analyst who says Apple and Microsoft should merge to fight Google.
[00:59:04.920 --> 00:59:07.960]   I don't think that's such a bad idea.
[00:59:07.960 --> 00:59:10.920]   It's got a lot of sports, Scott Forest Law, both companies.
[00:59:10.920 --> 00:59:11.920]   I don't know.
[00:59:11.920 --> 00:59:12.920]   There's lots of people think, not lots.
[00:59:12.920 --> 00:59:13.920]   I get tweets from people.
[00:59:13.920 --> 00:59:16.800]   Maybe it's one guy who thinks Scott Forest Law should run Microsoft.
[00:59:16.800 --> 00:59:18.360]   That just seems like such a bad idea.
[00:59:18.360 --> 00:59:20.560]   That'd be awesome.
[00:59:20.560 --> 00:59:21.560]   For Apple.
[00:59:21.560 --> 00:59:22.560]   Exactly.
[00:59:22.560 --> 00:59:26.160]   Are sure they brought you by, hey, by the way, great panel.
[00:59:26.160 --> 00:59:27.160]   Love you guys.
[00:59:27.160 --> 00:59:32.040]   Chris Breen is here from Macworld.com, Andy Anako from the Chicago Sun Times.
[00:59:32.040 --> 00:59:35.040]   Renee Richie from iMore.com and from the Pixel Core.
[00:59:35.040 --> 00:59:36.040]   Alex Lindsey.
[00:59:36.040 --> 00:59:39.440]   You couldn't put together a team of four guys who know more about Mac.
[00:59:39.440 --> 00:59:42.160]   Alex is the only one of us who didn't wave at the viewer.
[00:59:42.160 --> 00:59:43.160]   Would you wave?
[00:59:43.160 --> 00:59:44.360]   Take from that what you will, viewer.
[00:59:44.360 --> 00:59:45.800]   Yeah, he doesn't like you.
[00:59:45.800 --> 00:59:47.280]   I can tell.
[00:59:47.280 --> 00:59:49.680]   Jazz hands.
[00:59:49.680 --> 00:59:53.160]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:59:53.160 --> 00:59:57.200]   Our show today brought to you by personal capital.
[00:59:57.200 --> 01:00:00.440]   We interviewed the guy who founded a personal capital.
[01:00:00.440 --> 01:00:05.160]   I think this is just so cool.
[01:00:05.160 --> 01:00:09.080]   I want to say like four words at the same time.
[01:00:09.080 --> 01:00:12.920]   Cool, innovative, exciting and free.
[01:00:12.920 --> 01:00:16.920]   Bill Harris, the guy who started was the CEO of PayPal.
[01:00:16.920 --> 01:00:18.920]   He was the CEO of Intuit.
[01:00:18.920 --> 01:00:23.960]   And while he was at Intuit, he really watched how people, you know, you remember the days
[01:00:23.960 --> 01:00:28.080]   when everybody went out and bought quick in or if you were on Microsoft, Microsoft Money
[01:00:28.080 --> 01:00:33.240]   and you enter, you get your statement and you enter in your whole, all the transactions
[01:00:33.240 --> 01:00:34.720]   for the month and you do the budgeting.
[01:00:34.720 --> 01:00:35.720]   I did that.
[01:00:35.720 --> 01:00:36.720]   I loved it.
[01:00:36.720 --> 01:00:37.720]   It was like the number one use for personal computers.
[01:00:37.720 --> 01:00:43.200]   I typed in programs from Compute Magazine and Basic on my Atari 800 to do that.
[01:00:43.200 --> 01:00:45.120]   That's what like the first thing you wanted to do.
[01:00:45.120 --> 01:00:50.120]   Well, I think Bill realized that while he was running Intuit, the really the best way
[01:00:50.120 --> 01:00:55.160]   to do this nowadays, since all that information is already available to you, is have a company
[01:00:55.160 --> 01:01:00.040]   collate that all, put together a dashboard, let you know what your financial situation
[01:01:00.040 --> 01:01:02.680]   is without any data entry on your part.
[01:01:02.680 --> 01:01:07.320]   This is a truly a next generation financial advisor.
[01:01:07.320 --> 01:01:10.160]   And once you get this dashboard, then the next question is, what do you do with it?
[01:01:10.160 --> 01:01:12.400]   I mean, in fact, that came up all the time.
[01:01:12.400 --> 01:01:14.120]   Well, now I've spent all this time entering in my stuff.
[01:01:14.120 --> 01:01:16.760]   What am I checking the bank to see if their math is right?
[01:01:16.760 --> 01:01:19.280]   I think we've learned that the math is right.
[01:01:19.280 --> 01:01:20.280]   Most of the time.
[01:01:20.280 --> 01:01:21.280]   Most of the time.
[01:01:21.280 --> 01:01:22.280]   And I mean, come on, really.
[01:01:22.280 --> 01:01:23.280]   Do you?
[01:01:23.280 --> 01:01:25.640]   I don't really feel like I need to check the bank's math anymore.
[01:01:25.640 --> 01:01:26.800]   So what do you do with it?
[01:01:26.800 --> 01:01:30.300]   Well, what Bill said is now you have an understanding of your financial life.
[01:01:30.300 --> 01:01:32.060]   You can now invest sensibly.
[01:01:32.060 --> 01:01:36.420]   You can think about where your money is, what it's doing, whether you're wasting money.
[01:01:36.420 --> 01:01:38.020]   And that's where personal capital comes in.
[01:01:38.020 --> 01:01:40.540]   The more progress you make, it really is a catch-22.
[01:01:40.540 --> 01:01:43.460]   In your financial life, the more complicated it is to manage, but the more you need to
[01:01:43.460 --> 01:01:44.860]   manage it.
[01:01:44.860 --> 01:01:47.060]   You've got to count checking savings, retirement.
[01:01:47.060 --> 01:01:48.260]   I hope you have an investment account.
[01:01:48.260 --> 01:01:49.260]   Of course, you've got a mortgage.
[01:01:49.260 --> 01:01:51.180]   If you have a house, you've got a car loan.
[01:01:51.180 --> 01:01:53.940]   I mean, all of this stuff is all floating around.
[01:01:53.940 --> 01:01:55.980]   And it's a big fuzzy cloud around your head.
[01:01:55.980 --> 01:01:58.340]   Makes it hard to make investment decisions.
[01:01:58.340 --> 01:01:59.740]   That's where personal capital comes in.
[01:01:59.740 --> 01:02:04.620]   They say it's like a GPS for your financial life at your fingertips.
[01:02:04.620 --> 01:02:06.420]   I just think it's the kind of thing you really want.
[01:02:06.420 --> 01:02:08.060]   They've got a financial dashboard.
[01:02:08.060 --> 01:02:09.460]   They've got mobile apps.
[01:02:09.460 --> 01:02:13.900]   And of course, financial advisors will help you invest.
[01:02:13.900 --> 01:02:15.820]   And signing up just takes a minute.

[01:02:21.980 --> 01:02:24.340]   There's Bill walking his dog on the marina.
[01:02:24.340 --> 01:02:25.940]   He is a really neat guy.
[01:02:25.940 --> 01:02:28.500]   Go back and look at the triangulation we did with him about a year ago.
[01:02:28.500 --> 01:02:31.020]   That's when I started using personal capital.
[01:02:31.020 --> 01:02:32.420]   And I just love it.
[01:02:32.420 --> 01:02:33.940]   Personalcapital.com/macbreak.
[01:02:33.940 --> 01:02:38.620]   If the time has come to make sense of your financial life.
[01:02:38.620 --> 01:02:39.940]   Someday.
[01:02:39.940 --> 01:02:43.500]   See, you're a perfect example.
[01:02:43.500 --> 01:02:46.180]   You're too busy to make sense of your financial life.
[01:02:46.180 --> 01:02:48.060]   But I have a wife that is very good at that.
[01:02:48.060 --> 01:02:49.060]   Fortunately, you have Carlita.
[01:02:49.060 --> 01:02:50.060]   That is true.
[01:02:50.060 --> 01:02:51.060]   Carlita is the saving grace.
[01:02:51.060 --> 01:02:52.060]   Otherwise, I'd be a pop-up.
[01:02:52.060 --> 01:02:54.460]   If you don't have a Carlita on the street, I'd be on the street.
[01:02:54.460 --> 01:02:56.220]   You know, Carlita should use personal capital.
[01:02:56.220 --> 01:02:57.220]   I'm going to show it to her.
[01:02:57.220 --> 01:02:59.700]   Yeah, yeah, it's really awesome.
[01:02:59.700 --> 01:03:03.180]   So a Siri Doc for your living room.
[01:03:03.180 --> 01:03:04.180]   It's a smart Doc.
[01:03:04.180 --> 01:03:09.620]   This comes from Apple Insider that would bring Siri.
[01:03:09.620 --> 01:03:13.700]   This is from a US-- see, I'm always nervous about talking about patent decisions because
[01:03:13.700 --> 01:03:17.240]   as you know, every company patents everything nowadays more than ever because of patent
[01:03:17.240 --> 01:03:18.240]   trolls.
[01:03:18.240 --> 01:03:23.220]   But it's a Apple that published a patent application that involves a smart Doc that listens for
[01:03:23.220 --> 01:03:26.740]   cues to activate and communicate with the voice recognition functions of the device
[01:03:26.740 --> 01:03:28.580]   doctor that like the iPhone and the iPad.
[01:03:28.580 --> 01:03:32.780]   Then the only reason I give this more credence perhaps than the average patent is that's
[01:03:32.780 --> 01:03:34.980]   exactly what the Connect does.
[01:03:34.980 --> 01:03:37.740]   That's exactly what Ford Sync does.
[01:03:37.740 --> 01:03:39.580]   This is clearly where we're headed.
[01:03:39.580 --> 01:03:43.340]   And Apple has this Siri technology.
[01:03:43.340 --> 01:03:44.340]   Seems like they should use it.
[01:03:44.340 --> 01:03:47.100]   Put it in the Mac at the very least.
[01:03:47.100 --> 01:03:48.100]   Right.
[01:03:48.100 --> 01:03:50.020]   It's not even in a Mac.
[01:03:50.020 --> 01:03:51.020]   Yeah.
[01:03:51.020 --> 01:03:55.900]   I think that the computers get more useful when we don't necessarily have to take them
[01:03:55.900 --> 01:03:58.940]   out of our pockets or walk over them in order to use them.
[01:03:58.940 --> 01:04:00.860]   So I've been for 10, 15 years.
[01:04:00.860 --> 01:04:05.660]   I'm in shock that we haven't seen a company do this sort of stuff before.
[01:04:05.660 --> 01:04:10.460]   Just if I'm walking through a room on my way out the door, I really want the ability to
[01:04:10.460 --> 01:04:13.020]   say Siri, what's the weather today?
[01:04:13.020 --> 01:04:17.140]   What's the weather in Boston at 2 p.m. today as I'm trying to contemplate which coat to
[01:04:17.140 --> 01:04:18.140]   take off the rack?
[01:04:18.140 --> 01:04:19.140]   I'm going to set it.
[01:04:19.140 --> 01:04:21.140]   I'm going to use my keys and say, have it.
[01:04:21.140 --> 01:04:22.140]   Can we add a couch?
[01:04:22.140 --> 01:04:23.580]   Because you've got an eye beacon on it.
[01:04:23.580 --> 01:04:24.580]   Exactly.
[01:04:24.580 --> 01:04:25.580]   You know what?
[01:04:25.580 --> 01:04:26.660]   I can actually do that with my Moto X.
[01:04:26.660 --> 01:04:28.540]   I can say, OK, Google now.
[01:04:28.540 --> 01:04:29.540]   And what is the command?
[01:04:29.540 --> 01:04:32.980]   I can't remember, like, where's my phone?
[01:04:32.980 --> 01:04:34.980]   And the phone will start screaming.
[01:04:34.980 --> 01:04:35.980]   Swear to God.
[01:04:35.980 --> 01:04:39.260]   And so what you end up doing, if you've lost your phone and I tried this the other day,
[01:04:39.260 --> 01:04:43.780]   you walk around in the house like an idiot going, OK, Google now, where's my phone?
[01:04:43.780 --> 01:04:45.180]   OK, Google now, where's my phone?
[01:04:45.180 --> 01:04:47.220]   I wanted to sound like a goat.
[01:04:47.220 --> 01:04:49.220]   If it's going to scream.
[01:04:49.220 --> 01:04:50.220]   I got a scream.
[01:04:50.220 --> 01:04:51.220]   Oh, no.
[01:04:51.220 --> 01:04:53.220]   19 Android phones start screaming at you.
[01:04:53.220 --> 01:04:54.220]   Awesome.
[01:04:54.220 --> 01:04:55.900]   No, because it's only a Moto X feature.
[01:04:55.900 --> 01:04:56.900]   You're right.
[01:04:56.900 --> 01:04:58.620]   And that's it would be nice.
[01:04:58.620 --> 01:05:00.340]   Let me just see what the sound is.
[01:05:00.340 --> 01:05:01.940]   I can't remember what it is.
[01:05:01.940 --> 01:05:03.740]   Do you remember Andy with the command is?
[01:05:03.740 --> 01:05:04.940]   Oh, I don't know.
[01:05:04.940 --> 01:05:07.300]   OK, Google now, where's my phone?
[01:05:07.300 --> 01:05:09.100]   Maybe it's fine.
[01:05:09.100 --> 01:05:10.100]   My phone.
[01:05:10.100 --> 01:05:11.100]   Yeah.
[01:05:11.100 --> 01:05:15.540]   OK, Google now.
[01:05:15.540 --> 01:05:17.580]   I'm going to read my phone.
[01:05:17.580 --> 01:05:19.020]   See if it does that.
[01:05:19.020 --> 01:05:20.660]   Uh oh.
[01:05:20.660 --> 01:05:21.660]   That's it.
[01:05:21.660 --> 01:05:23.660]   That sounds screaming.
[01:05:23.660 --> 01:05:25.220]   Well, we were going to look at this.
[01:05:25.220 --> 01:05:28.580]   It says you found me and it keeps doing that.
[01:05:28.580 --> 01:05:30.580]   There's things you found.
[01:05:30.580 --> 01:05:31.580]   You idiot.
[01:05:31.580 --> 01:05:33.380]   I was in the question.
[01:05:33.380 --> 01:05:35.180]   Couldn't you see me?
[01:05:35.180 --> 01:05:36.180]   Oh, my God.
[01:05:36.180 --> 01:05:37.180]   You have found me.
[01:05:37.180 --> 01:05:39.180]   Never let me go.
[01:05:39.180 --> 01:05:42.140]   Oh, you have found me.
[01:05:42.140 --> 01:05:48.220]   It's not exactly where I'm in the back bedroom and I'm shouting out to this document.
[01:05:48.220 --> 01:05:50.220]   Where are my glasses?
[01:05:50.220 --> 01:05:51.220]   What?
[01:05:51.220 --> 01:05:52.220]   What?
[01:05:52.220 --> 01:05:53.220]   Where am I?
[01:05:53.220 --> 01:05:54.220]   I'm talking to you.
[01:05:54.220 --> 01:05:57.100]   I'm talking to the thing and the thing and where are my glasses?
[01:05:57.100 --> 01:05:58.460]   They're on your head, you idiot.
[01:05:58.460 --> 01:05:59.820]   What are you talking about?
[01:05:59.820 --> 01:06:00.820]   Shut up.
[01:06:00.820 --> 01:06:05.020]   Jim, Jim, Jim, Donald Post from this week was shut up series series because he had to
[01:06:05.020 --> 01:06:07.180]   explain to his wife who he was telling to shut up.
[01:06:07.180 --> 01:06:09.460]   Shut up series series.
[01:06:09.460 --> 01:06:10.460]   His wife's not named Siri.
[01:06:10.460 --> 01:06:11.460]   Is it?
[01:06:11.460 --> 01:06:13.860]   He wanted to make sure his gender study was talking to Siri.
[01:06:13.860 --> 01:06:14.860]   Yeah.
[01:06:14.860 --> 01:06:18.180]   Well, we could be a good example of as we were talking about another technology that Apple
[01:06:18.180 --> 01:06:22.100]   really could have owned the world and just kind of let it die out.
[01:06:22.100 --> 01:06:23.340]   I use it over every day.
[01:06:23.340 --> 01:06:24.340]   Do you?
[01:06:24.340 --> 01:06:25.340]   All right.
[01:06:25.340 --> 01:06:26.340]   Me too.
[01:06:26.340 --> 01:06:27.340]   Seems like it could be better.
[01:06:27.340 --> 01:06:28.340]   Me as you.
[01:06:28.340 --> 01:06:31.140]   Back from Petalumilio and my friend Phil Nickinson from Androids Central dropped his Moto X into
[01:06:31.140 --> 01:06:35.300]   the car and he said, you know, Google, okay, Google now find my phone and it just started
[01:06:35.300 --> 01:06:38.780]   pinging under his seat while he seatbelted in trying to reach between the thing to find
[01:06:38.780 --> 01:06:39.780]   it.
[01:06:39.780 --> 01:06:42.420]   We wouldn't stop and he couldn't reach it.
[01:06:42.420 --> 01:06:45.580]   And we ended up doing all sorts of gymnastics and slap shots.
[01:06:45.580 --> 01:06:46.580]   I guess.
[01:06:46.580 --> 01:06:47.580]   Okay.
[01:06:47.580 --> 01:06:49.900]   Because Canada, it's illegal to pull over to use your phone.
[01:06:49.900 --> 01:06:53.700]   You're on one of your beautiful San Francisco highways.
[01:06:53.700 --> 01:06:57.660]   And I just should point out that there's no technology that's smart enough to defend itself
[01:06:57.660 --> 01:06:59.340]   against stupid users.
[01:06:59.340 --> 01:07:00.340]   Yeah.
[01:07:00.340 --> 01:07:01.340]   No.
[01:07:01.340 --> 01:07:02.340]   That's stupid.
[01:07:02.340 --> 01:07:08.780]   But that's another example of things that subtle plays that really change how you interact
[01:07:08.780 --> 01:07:10.100]   with these with these devices.
[01:07:10.100 --> 01:07:11.340]   Hey, my video is frozen.
[01:07:11.340 --> 01:07:12.340]   Can you hear me?
[01:07:12.340 --> 01:07:14.340]   Yeah, but it's at least frozen on a nice.
[01:07:14.340 --> 01:07:15.820]   It's a very it's a very nice photo.
[01:07:15.820 --> 01:07:17.620]   If you're going to be frozen, that's great.
[01:07:17.620 --> 01:07:20.460]   Screencap that quick so that when Andy's not with us.
[01:07:20.460 --> 01:07:22.220]   Yeah, we put that on.
[01:07:22.220 --> 01:07:23.620]   Just put that on.
[01:07:23.620 --> 01:07:24.620]   Last known photo.
[01:07:24.620 --> 01:07:25.620]   Yeah.
[01:07:25.620 --> 01:07:30.660]   I mean, I've been I've been using the Nexus 5 as my daily driver for a few weeks now and
[01:07:30.660 --> 01:07:36.060]   even just the ability to do the ability to do total hands off control and not have to
[01:07:36.060 --> 01:07:41.860]   tap a button in order to say to tell this device to shut up and listen.
[01:07:41.860 --> 01:07:42.860]   That's a big deal.
[01:07:42.860 --> 01:07:45.620]   That means that I know that it's right there on my desk.
[01:07:45.620 --> 01:07:47.020]   It's only two feet away.
[01:07:47.020 --> 01:07:51.740]   But the so many times now I will be typing working on something and I need to figure
[01:07:51.740 --> 01:07:57.860]   out I need to I need to convert amp hours into milliwatt hours and I will do, you know,
[01:07:57.860 --> 01:07:59.140]   okay, Google now.
[01:07:59.140 --> 01:08:01.900]   What is what is 3.2 times?
[01:08:01.900 --> 01:08:08.220]   I don't know 3.2 times the watt hours divided by excuse me, times a thousand divided by
[01:08:08.220 --> 01:08:10.540]   the voltage and we'll say the.
[01:08:10.540 --> 01:08:11.540]   I love it.
[01:08:11.540 --> 01:08:12.540]   It does that.
[01:08:12.540 --> 01:08:13.540]   And then I can still type.
[01:08:13.540 --> 01:08:14.540]   Okay.
[01:08:14.540 --> 01:08:16.500]   So this is a 2200 milliamp hour battery in the new iPad.
[01:08:16.500 --> 01:08:17.500]   Right.
[01:08:17.500 --> 01:08:18.500]   Yes.
[01:08:18.500 --> 01:08:19.500]   Awesome.
[01:08:19.500 --> 01:08:20.500]   Isn't that awesome?
[01:08:20.500 --> 01:08:21.260]   By the way, Andy's doing his best Jeff Dunham right now.
[01:08:21.260 --> 01:08:22.340]   Your lips are not moving.
[01:08:22.340 --> 01:08:23.340]   It's good.
[01:08:23.340 --> 01:08:26.540]   I've got a puppet and he hates all gay people.
[01:08:26.540 --> 01:08:30.140]   What do you got to say about the gay people puppet?
[01:08:30.140 --> 01:08:31.140]   Yeah.
[01:08:31.140 --> 01:08:32.140]   It's not me.
[01:08:32.140 --> 01:08:33.140]   It's the puppet.
[01:08:33.140 --> 01:08:34.940]   It's not Andy.
[01:08:34.940 --> 01:08:38.260]   It's puppet Andy iOS adoption rates.
[01:08:38.260 --> 01:08:45.780]   iOS 7 adoption rates, according to the app store usage numbers are whopping 74%.
[01:08:45.780 --> 01:08:46.780]   That's pretty good.
[01:08:46.780 --> 01:08:52.740]   I opened up one of my and iPod touch and opened it up and it was still in iOS 6 and
[01:08:52.740 --> 01:08:54.380]   felt like I had dropped back into the dark case.
[01:08:54.380 --> 01:08:56.380]   Well, and iOS 6 is pretty new itself.
[01:08:56.380 --> 01:08:57.860]   And if you that's 22%.
[01:08:57.860 --> 01:09:03.500]   So 96% of iOS users are using the last two versions.
[01:09:03.500 --> 01:09:04.500]   That's a lot better than Android.
[01:09:04.500 --> 01:09:09.540]   You have to remember that iPad one can't use iOS 7 iPhone 3GS can't use it and people
[01:09:09.540 --> 01:09:11.340]   waiting for jail breaks haven't updated yet.
[01:09:11.340 --> 01:09:15.540]   So it may well be that almost everybody who could has.
[01:09:15.540 --> 01:09:18.900]   That's pretty impressive, especially given that I just hate iOS 7.
[01:09:18.900 --> 01:09:20.980]   And I think only one is still doesn't like it.
[01:09:20.980 --> 01:09:22.780]   They just move you along to it though.
[01:09:22.780 --> 01:09:25.340]   They really want you to use iOS 7, you know.
[01:09:25.340 --> 01:09:26.620]   And plus you can't go back.
[01:09:26.620 --> 01:09:31.860]   So I'm sure there's a small percentage of people there who thought I'd rather go back
[01:09:31.860 --> 01:09:34.580]   to iOS 6 and there's no way back.
[01:09:34.580 --> 01:09:39.420]   Here's a that's the only reason why I've been telling people to hold off until they really
[01:09:39.420 --> 01:09:43.380]   have verified that every single app and service they use still works because it's like, oh,
[01:09:43.380 --> 01:09:44.700]   it's such it's going to be such a nightmare.
[01:09:44.700 --> 01:09:49.620]   If the one app you need doesn't work anymore, it is not it's not going to be a subtle problem.
[01:09:49.620 --> 01:09:57.780]   Jesus Diaz has done a tumbler on apples on the dumbest sloppiest mistakes in it's called
[01:09:57.780 --> 01:10:03.700]   sloppy UI on iOS 7.
[01:10:03.700 --> 01:10:04.780]   Actually it's not just iOS 7.
[01:10:04.780 --> 01:10:06.220]   It's a lot of different places.
[01:10:06.220 --> 01:10:10.780]   But there's quite a few things in iOS 7 that probably.
[01:10:10.780 --> 01:10:12.300]   They were out of time.
[01:10:12.300 --> 01:10:16.340]   I mean, they started in December and they ran to WWDC and they just didn't have time
[01:10:16.340 --> 01:10:17.340]   to finish.
[01:10:17.340 --> 01:10:18.340]   Yeah.
[01:10:18.340 --> 01:10:23.860]   I mean, this is this can be kind of ugly frankly.
[01:10:23.860 --> 01:10:29.020]   But the thing is they've had how many updates to updates now.
[01:10:29.020 --> 01:10:36.780]   It just seems like if there's screen locks, there's no way to hang up the call without
[01:10:36.780 --> 01:10:40.500]   first sliding the bar, entering your passcode, then hitting the button to hang up.
[01:10:40.500 --> 01:10:43.860]   I've had that happen, but that's not that's not the end of the world.
[01:10:43.860 --> 01:10:45.900]   It bothers me a lot less now that I can reset it.
[01:10:45.900 --> 01:10:49.340]   I had a phone that didn't have the, you couldn't turn off.
[01:10:49.340 --> 01:10:54.220]   And then it would lock, it would lock up and then there was no way to just burn the battery
[01:10:54.220 --> 01:10:55.220]   out until.
[01:10:55.220 --> 01:10:57.780]   It started to remove all the batteries.
[01:10:57.780 --> 01:10:59.780]   There's such a nice thing.
[01:10:59.780 --> 01:11:00.780]   I know.
[01:11:00.780 --> 01:11:01.780]   Yeah.
[01:11:01.780 --> 01:11:04.540]   Sounds has two different icons.
[01:11:04.540 --> 01:11:08.540]   Just I mean, there's lots of things that you just have to think that.
[01:11:08.540 --> 01:11:10.460]   So you think it was just they ran out of time huh?
[01:11:10.460 --> 01:11:11.460]   No, they absolutely did.
[01:11:11.460 --> 01:11:15.460]   I mean, usually like, if Scott Forestall had a left, if Johnny I've had an assumed
[01:11:15.460 --> 01:11:18.900]   control of the design, iOS 7 would have looked a lot like iOS 6.
[01:11:18.900 --> 01:11:22.060]   It would have had background downloads and a few of the other, the new multitasking
[01:11:22.060 --> 01:11:24.460]   features and whatever else was on the roadmap.
[01:11:24.460 --> 01:11:28.220]   But when he left and Johnny, I took over, they decided, you know, very late in the cycle.
[01:11:28.220 --> 01:11:31.620]   They only had an, and Apple's not going to move WWDC and they're not going to move the
[01:11:31.620 --> 01:11:32.620]   new phone release.
[01:11:32.620 --> 01:11:36.860]   And to some, in some degree, they are now slaves of their release cycle.
[01:11:36.860 --> 01:11:39.340]   They had to do an incredibly ambitious project.
[01:11:39.340 --> 01:11:42.980]   And as we remember, WWDC, the iPad version wasn't even ready for beta when they released
[01:11:42.980 --> 01:11:45.340]   the iPhone version. It was two weeks later.
[01:11:45.340 --> 01:11:49.620]   And every, I mean, they hit that deadline about as hard as you can hit a deadline.
[01:11:49.620 --> 01:11:52.620]   And I think they absolutely just ran out of runway and they're going to fix a lot of
[01:11:52.620 --> 01:11:54.380]   stuff over the course of this year.
[01:11:54.380 --> 01:11:55.940]   It's all cut. Most of it's cosmetic, right?
[01:11:55.940 --> 01:11:59.540]   I mean, I, although I for a long time, I had rebooting phone.
[01:11:59.540 --> 01:12:01.060]   That seems to have been fixed.
[01:12:01.060 --> 01:12:02.060]   Respringing was a free phone.
[01:12:02.060 --> 01:12:04.620]   Respringing, sorry, not rebooting. And that's important distinction.
[01:12:04.620 --> 01:12:07.900]   The phone feels like it's rebooted, but because you see the Apple icon, but really there's
[01:12:07.900 --> 01:12:08.900]   just springboard relaunching.
[01:12:08.900 --> 01:12:09.900]   Yeah.
[01:12:09.900 --> 01:12:12.100]   And there's a lot of stability stuff they have to fix.
[01:12:12.100 --> 01:12:13.980]   And a lot of edge cases that they have to fix.
[01:12:13.980 --> 01:12:16.660]   So is the advice still to wait?
[01:12:16.660 --> 01:12:17.660]   The device.
[01:12:17.660 --> 01:12:20.420]   Or be one of the 74%.
[01:12:20.420 --> 01:12:21.500]   I just get the iOS 7.
[01:12:21.500 --> 01:12:24.860]   It's getting me to benefit the benefits far outweigh the drawbacks.
[01:12:24.860 --> 01:12:26.620]   There's just so much you can do with it now.
[01:12:26.620 --> 01:12:27.620]   All right.
[01:12:27.620 --> 01:12:28.620]   Okay.
[01:12:28.620 --> 01:12:32.420]   Again, it depends. I would definitely go to the message boards, go to the forums and
[01:12:32.420 --> 01:12:35.540]   if again, if there's stuff, you have, you have a good idea.
[01:12:35.540 --> 01:12:36.540]   Ah, dang it.
[01:12:36.540 --> 01:12:39.980]   Okay. Well, I'll still this will, this will be, this will be the radio theater of the air.
[01:12:39.980 --> 01:12:43.140]   I'll be, I'll be like, I'll just put it on it though.
[01:12:43.140 --> 01:12:44.140]   I love it.
[01:12:44.140 --> 01:12:45.140]   At the lighting right.
[01:12:45.140 --> 01:12:46.140]   Yeah.
[01:12:46.140 --> 01:12:49.420]   All I'm saying is that we all know like what the three really killer features that we have
[01:12:49.420 --> 01:12:51.660]   that this is, this is not an iPhone or this is not an iPad.
[01:12:51.660 --> 01:12:56.020]   If you can't do this thing, definitely for the first time, check to make sure that that
[01:12:56.020 --> 01:12:58.940]   feature still works or that, or the third party app still works.
[01:12:58.940 --> 01:13:05.180]   I still have not updated my, my iPad yet because I've got a, I've got a problem with a single
[01:13:05.180 --> 01:13:07.340]   app that I haven't really clicked yet.
[01:13:07.340 --> 01:13:10.060]   And I really want to see if I can keep that one going for another.
[01:13:10.060 --> 01:13:12.660]   I mean, I'm just looking through comments in the chat room.
[01:13:12.660 --> 01:13:15.700]   I movie looks like crap and it's harder to use.
[01:13:15.700 --> 01:13:18.020]   Fonts are too small on iOS seven.
[01:13:18.020 --> 01:13:20.900]   Um, you can dynamically adjust those now.
[01:13:20.900 --> 01:13:25.260]   I mean, there's dynamic fonts in iOS seven dies with 50% battery left frustrating, but
[01:13:25.260 --> 01:13:27.100]   not the end of the world.
[01:13:27.100 --> 01:13:32.420]   Um, I spring, respringing is not fixed as Giancarlo.
[01:13:32.420 --> 01:13:38.140]   Respringing happens on the iPhone four for him, iPhone four, for Hitchens 52, resprings
[01:13:38.140 --> 01:13:39.140]   all the time.
[01:13:39.140 --> 01:13:42.740]   To be fair though, I mean, I run a fairly popular Apple website and I get exactly the
[01:13:42.740 --> 01:13:43.740]   same complaints.
[01:13:43.740 --> 01:13:46.860]   Anytime you update your operating system, you pay more attention to things and things break.
[01:13:46.860 --> 01:13:49.540]   And iOS two was horrible iOS three was horrible.
[01:13:49.540 --> 01:13:50.980]   iOS four was horrible.
[01:13:50.980 --> 01:13:52.140]   Five and six were more incremental.
[01:13:52.140 --> 01:13:53.740]   So they had fewer problems.
[01:13:53.740 --> 01:13:58.820]   But overall, we tend to forget the pain of the past and remember very vividly the pain of
[01:13:58.820 --> 01:13:59.820]   the current.
[01:13:59.820 --> 01:14:02.380]   The present we always remember.
[01:14:02.380 --> 01:14:05.300]   What about Bitcoin and why is Apple down on Bitcoin?
[01:14:05.300 --> 01:14:11.820]   We're talking about the most recent Bitcoin app, Glyph, which is Glyph is an interesting
[01:14:11.820 --> 01:14:12.820]   app.
[01:14:12.820 --> 01:14:17.900]   It's a secure messaging app that could be used among other things to transfer Bitcoins
[01:14:17.900 --> 01:14:20.900]   from one Glyph user to another.
[01:14:20.900 --> 01:14:26.740]   Apple says you cannot release Glyph or a Glyph update until you take that out.
[01:14:26.740 --> 01:14:29.540]   Number of Bitcoin apps have also been pulled.
[01:14:29.540 --> 01:14:35.060]   Apple says we can't allow according to our terms of service, we can't allow technologies
[01:14:35.060 --> 01:14:40.420]   that are legal in any of the countries we operate in in any of our apps.
[01:14:40.420 --> 01:14:47.020]   But I don't think well, China has banned financial institutions from handling Bitcoin transactions
[01:14:47.020 --> 01:14:49.300]   but does allow person to person transactions.
[01:14:49.300 --> 01:14:54.540]   I don't think Bitcoin is illegal to my knowledge in any jurisdiction yet.
[01:14:54.540 --> 01:14:56.500]   Is Apple being proactive?
[01:14:56.500 --> 01:14:59.500]   Hello?
[01:14:59.500 --> 01:15:01.500]   Did everybody freeze?
[01:15:01.500 --> 01:15:03.100]   No, it's okay.
[01:15:03.100 --> 01:15:04.820]   We all step back.
[01:15:04.820 --> 01:15:05.820]   Yeah.
[01:15:05.820 --> 01:15:11.020]   I mean, Bitcoin is not porno, although you could say thanks to think Silk wrote it as
[01:15:11.020 --> 01:15:15.260]   a reputation of being used for drugs.
[01:15:15.260 --> 01:15:18.460]   But I don't think that's the only way it's used.
[01:15:18.460 --> 01:15:23.060]   Apple has pulled every Bitcoin app as far as I know, blockchain, BitPak, Bitcoin Express,
[01:15:23.060 --> 01:15:27.860]   Coinbase, and now Glyph.
[01:15:27.860 --> 01:15:30.940]   It's new and Apple is incredibly conservative in the app store.
[01:15:30.940 --> 01:15:34.660]   And they're probably, I mean, at some point, someone very executive will make a decision
[01:15:34.660 --> 01:15:35.660]   about it.
[01:15:35.660 --> 01:15:37.860]   But until then, it's probably, oh, look, world's first digital currency.
[01:15:37.860 --> 01:15:39.100]   We have no idea what this means.
[01:15:39.100 --> 01:15:40.100]   Let's just wait.
[01:15:40.100 --> 01:15:41.100]   Yeah.
[01:15:41.100 --> 01:15:43.100]   This is an example of discretionary use of power.
[01:15:43.100 --> 01:15:46.580]   I don't think they have a specific reason why they don't want a part of this.
[01:15:46.580 --> 01:15:52.300]   But given the really horrendous potential for disaster, both in terms of having essentially
[01:15:52.300 --> 01:15:59.980]   an app that consumes, consumes, consumes CPU and something that can be used for massive
[01:15:59.980 --> 01:16:08.660]   scale financial fraud, maybe this is, maybe it's okay to have 498,998 apps available on
[01:16:08.660 --> 01:16:10.700]   the app store instead of the full 500,000.
[01:16:10.700 --> 01:16:11.700]   Yeah.
[01:16:11.700 --> 01:16:13.500]   And I think you're right.
[01:16:13.500 --> 01:16:19.100]   Apple doesn't want a big story about somebody losing $33 million in Bitcoin on his iPhone.
[01:16:19.100 --> 01:16:21.660]   Because it would be an Apple in the headline.
[01:16:21.660 --> 01:16:22.660]   Right.
[01:16:22.660 --> 01:16:25.940]   So maybe it's simply Thailand, by the way.
[01:16:25.940 --> 01:16:26.940]   It's illegal in Thailand.
[01:16:26.940 --> 01:16:30.100]   This is from the Guardian actually five hours ago.
[01:16:30.100 --> 01:16:34.700]   So it's, so they looked in the looked and they found a country that was illegal in.
[01:16:34.700 --> 01:16:35.700]   See?
[01:16:35.700 --> 01:16:36.700]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:16:36.700 --> 01:16:38.700]   Wipe their collective brow and said, good.
[01:16:38.700 --> 01:16:40.500]   We can avoid Bitcoin.
[01:16:40.500 --> 01:16:41.500]   Thanks.
[01:16:41.500 --> 01:16:45.060]   It does not hurt their mainstream customer base for them to wait.
[01:16:45.060 --> 01:16:47.900]   Like they're no one is going to, my mom is not going to feel any pain whatsoever.
[01:16:47.900 --> 01:16:49.100]   No, mom doesn't know.
[01:16:49.100 --> 01:16:50.100]   They're, yeah, right.
[01:16:50.100 --> 01:16:51.100]   Of course.
[01:16:51.100 --> 01:16:55.580]   Just back into the whole Apple's worried about 90% of what, what will 90% of the people do
[01:16:55.580 --> 01:16:59.380]   90% of the time and Bitcoin is somewhere in the 1% of 1%.
[01:16:59.380 --> 01:17:02.380]   As somebody who is in the 1%, I like using my Android phone for that.
[01:17:02.380 --> 01:17:03.380]   Very reason.
[01:17:03.380 --> 01:17:04.380]   Absolutely.
[01:17:04.380 --> 01:17:08.300]   By the way, seven, get ready 700 million more customers by the end of the month.
[01:17:08.300 --> 01:17:15.820]   Apple is finally done a deal with China Mobile, the biggest carrier in China to carry the iPhone.
[01:17:15.820 --> 01:17:18.700]   Now they're going to have more cash or they have to figure out how to deal with it.
[01:17:18.700 --> 01:17:20.940]   Now what is really a real problem for Apple?
[01:17:20.940 --> 01:17:24.300]   No, but they're doomed, Alex, because this was the last of the big low hanging fruit.
[01:17:24.300 --> 01:17:25.300]   What are they going to do now?
[01:17:25.300 --> 01:17:26.300]   That's true.
[01:17:26.300 --> 01:17:27.300]   It's over.
[01:17:27.300 --> 01:17:28.300]   Why doesn't it?
[01:17:28.300 --> 01:17:29.300]   Easy growth is over.
[01:17:29.300 --> 01:17:33.420]   We have to, now we have to open new world, new planets, boldly go where no, yes.
[01:17:33.420 --> 01:17:35.220]   Martian mobile.
[01:17:35.220 --> 01:17:42.260]   It is seven, the subscribers, just to put this in perspective, seven times bigger than the
[01:17:42.260 --> 01:17:55.180]   entire subscriber base of Verizon, which is the US largest carrier, 700 million people.
[01:17:55.180 --> 01:18:00.020]   Some research firms are saying Apple might sell as many as 1.5 million iPhones per month
[01:18:00.020 --> 01:18:03.900]   in China, 20 million activations in 2014.
[01:18:03.900 --> 01:18:05.340]   Could be more than that though.
[01:18:05.340 --> 01:18:08.300]   There's pent up demand.
[01:18:08.300 --> 01:18:11.820]   China Mobile also has the most, apparently I'm told, I don't know, I think, the most
[01:18:11.820 --> 01:18:13.420]   affluent customer base.
[01:18:13.420 --> 01:18:17.820]   That's of course the one Apple wants, right?
[01:18:17.820 --> 01:18:19.300]   So good.
[01:18:19.300 --> 01:18:22.460]   We don't know what that concessions Apple made, but the...
[01:18:22.460 --> 01:18:25.300]   Well they've been talking about China for a long time.
[01:18:25.300 --> 01:18:27.060]   Oh, they've wanted China Mobile forever.
[01:18:27.060 --> 01:18:30.340]   Yeah, in the last two years they said, oh yes, look at all the Chinese support.
[01:18:30.340 --> 01:18:35.300]   They've even put these things into keynotes where the local audience doesn't care at all
[01:18:35.300 --> 01:18:38.620]   about this, but they wanted that message to go out loud and clear to China.
[01:18:38.620 --> 01:18:42.860]   So various language supports they put into the thing, the various markets they're willing
[01:18:42.860 --> 01:18:46.860]   to open up, and I think some of the privacy stuff as well, the Chinese government cares
[01:18:46.860 --> 01:18:47.860]   about it.
[01:18:47.860 --> 01:18:51.500]   I think they probably had several deals and say, yeah, we don't have to give you access
[01:18:51.500 --> 01:18:53.060]   to everything else in the world.
[01:18:53.060 --> 01:18:55.180]   We're willing to do X, Y, and Z for you.
[01:18:55.180 --> 01:19:00.740]   Yeah, they're not willing to support Google+, but they will support Chinese-only social
[01:19:00.740 --> 01:19:03.740]   networks and stuff like that.
[01:19:03.740 --> 01:19:11.100]   The Wall Street Journal's op-ed page, known for its independence and free thinking, has
[01:19:11.100 --> 01:19:20.380]   called Judge Cote, the judge in charge of the Apple ebook case, Apple's Star Chamber,
[01:19:20.380 --> 01:19:26.700]   an abusive judge, and her prosecutor friend, besiege the tech maker.
[01:19:26.700 --> 01:19:29.260]   It's like an epic point of view.
[01:19:29.260 --> 01:19:31.580]   This could get really interesting though, if you watch this case.
[01:19:31.580 --> 01:19:33.660]   She has really been throwing the book, so to speak.
[01:19:33.660 --> 01:19:37.820]   Well, she's now stepped into it, so we'll see how this turns out.
[01:19:37.820 --> 01:19:40.140]   She wants a special prosecutor hired.
[01:19:40.140 --> 01:19:44.900]   She has a special prosecutor hired who's an ass, but we all know that.
[01:19:44.900 --> 01:19:52.180]   But the most interesting part of this whole case is that she did a declarative ruling
[01:19:52.180 --> 01:19:56.700]   that said that she did not have any ex parte meetings with him.
[01:19:56.700 --> 01:20:03.020]   The next, she declared that Apple said that we're afraid she needs to declare whether
[01:20:03.020 --> 01:20:04.020]   she's already had some meetings.
[01:20:04.020 --> 01:20:06.020]   That's the whole side deal going on there.
[01:20:06.020 --> 01:20:07.340]   She declared that she doesn't.
[01:20:07.340 --> 01:20:10.500]   That's the beginning of a Watergate moment.
[01:20:10.500 --> 01:20:13.580]   If it turns out, because I can tell you right now, if I was Apple, I'd be spending a lot
[01:20:13.580 --> 01:20:19.700]   of investigative time figuring that out because basically I would throw her under the bus in
[01:20:19.700 --> 01:20:22.700]   a second if I could prove it.
[01:20:22.700 --> 01:20:26.740]   Now the problem is that if she ever had those meetings, even if she declared against them,
[01:20:26.740 --> 01:20:29.500]   she's going to be worried about protecting that.
[01:20:29.500 --> 01:20:32.860]   It definitely reduces her leverage dramatically as a judge.
[01:20:32.860 --> 01:20:34.700]   She's definitely gone away.
[01:20:34.700 --> 01:20:42.860]   It's fine to, if Apple broke the rules, it's fine to have a ruling, but she put on it.
[01:20:42.860 --> 01:20:44.700]   This is just a pit bull.
[01:20:44.700 --> 01:20:45.700]   She just applied to it.
[01:20:45.700 --> 01:20:53.220]   He has already asked for private documents that are according to the journal Beyond His
[01:20:53.220 --> 01:20:54.340]   Scope.
[01:20:54.340 --> 01:20:58.620]   He's going, instead of to Apple's lawyers, he's going directly to members of the board asking
[01:20:58.620 --> 01:20:59.620]   for information.
[01:20:59.620 --> 01:21:03.220]   He wants Johnny I have delivered in front of him on a silver platter.
[01:21:03.220 --> 01:21:07.820]   You bring me the head of Johnny I've.
[01:21:07.820 --> 01:21:11.940]   And ironically, he has no experience in any trust law.
[01:21:11.940 --> 01:21:15.060]   So he had to hire somebody at almost the same amount to actually do the antitrust stuff
[01:21:15.060 --> 01:21:16.620]   that he was supposed to do.
[01:21:16.620 --> 01:21:17.620]   Oh Lord.
[01:21:17.620 --> 01:21:22.060]   That's because he's, you know, and that, of course, you know, yeah, because he's her friend,
[01:21:22.060 --> 01:21:23.060]   right?
[01:21:23.060 --> 01:21:24.060]   Yeah.
[01:21:24.060 --> 01:21:25.060]   All right.
[01:21:25.060 --> 01:21:26.060]   So.
[01:21:26.060 --> 01:21:27.980]   But it's funny that the Wall Street Journal, who previously in this year had a several
[01:21:27.980 --> 01:21:31.820]   anti-Apple or pieces that were incredibly questionable, like Apple supply constraint.
[01:21:31.820 --> 01:21:35.540]   They won't be able to make these devices that were edited mysteriously without any,
[01:21:35.540 --> 01:21:39.580]   you know, proper disclosure is now doing these incredibly pro Apple pieces.
[01:21:39.580 --> 01:21:41.140]   And I have the same problem with that.
[01:21:41.140 --> 01:21:44.220]   Well, understand, and maybe, maybe because you're in Canada, you're not aware of this,
[01:21:44.220 --> 01:21:49.220]   that the editorial, the, the, the journalist part of the Wall Street Journal is very separate
[01:21:49.220 --> 01:21:50.420]   from the op-ed pages.
[01:21:50.420 --> 01:21:54.300]   And the op-ed pages are extremely conservative and very political.
[01:21:54.300 --> 01:21:56.300]   And their reporters are not supposed to be in.
[01:21:56.300 --> 01:21:59.180]   And the effects are not supposed to have any connection with the op-ed board.
[01:21:59.180 --> 01:22:00.180]   Yeah.
[01:22:00.180 --> 01:22:01.180]   That's not an attributed minor standing.
[01:22:01.180 --> 01:22:02.260]   No, they never say a name.
[01:22:02.260 --> 01:22:04.220]   And so it's, it's, it's complete.
[01:22:04.220 --> 01:22:08.940]   Well, they do if it's a guest, but it's, this is the, you know, so I think that this
[01:22:08.940 --> 01:22:13.540]   happens all the time with a journal where you can't judge from the opinion page.
[01:22:13.540 --> 01:22:16.900]   The jury, that's the, that's, that's a different thing than the press.
[01:22:16.900 --> 01:22:18.260]   Well, I was meant to say it.
[01:22:18.260 --> 01:22:19.660]   But there's a lot of articles about this.
[01:22:19.660 --> 01:22:22.820]   You don't have to look at the Wall Street Journal to see some of the articles that are,
[01:22:22.820 --> 01:22:23.820]   that have been written about it.
[01:22:23.820 --> 01:22:24.820]   Yeah.
[01:22:24.820 --> 01:22:25.820]   It's just.
[01:22:25.820 --> 01:22:26.820]   Yeah.
[01:22:26.820 --> 01:22:30.820]   Fortune's a much better article actually that I think is linked from one of these.
[01:22:30.820 --> 01:22:31.820]   Yeah.
[01:22:31.820 --> 01:22:32.820]   Yeah.
[01:22:32.820 --> 01:22:33.820]   Philip Elmer DeWitt linked to it.
[01:22:33.820 --> 01:22:37.180]   See, I, if, if I like, I like Philip Elmer DeWitt.
[01:22:37.180 --> 01:22:41.540]   So if he says it's good, behind Apple's mutiny against his court-ordered e-books monitor,
[01:22:41.540 --> 01:22:45.940]   this is Roger Parloff writing for Fortune.
[01:22:45.940 --> 01:22:49.420]   Apple's taking aim not just at the court-ordered monitor and the e-books, any trust case, but
[01:22:49.420 --> 01:22:53.180]   also at the judge.
[01:22:53.180 --> 01:22:57.980]   Accused Michael Bromwich, a partner at the law firm of Goodwin Proctor of charging excessive,
[01:22:57.980 --> 01:23:02.660]   charging excessive fees, behaving in an unfettered and appropriate manner, relying on secret
[01:23:02.660 --> 01:23:03.940]   communications with the court.
[01:23:03.940 --> 01:23:05.900]   That's the ex parte conversation.
[01:23:05.900 --> 01:23:10.660]   Evincing incredibly disruptive mission creep and acting in ways that threatens to term him
[01:23:10.660 --> 01:23:16.220]   into a quasi-institutional offshoot of the federal judge, will point at him in violation
[01:23:16.220 --> 01:23:19.620]   of the constitutional principle of separation of power as wow.
[01:23:19.620 --> 01:23:23.140]   Now remember, this is an adversarial, you know, these are, this is Apple's lawyers talking.
[01:23:23.140 --> 01:23:24.860]   This is the kind of thing you expect.
[01:23:24.860 --> 01:23:25.860]   He picked a fight though.
[01:23:25.860 --> 01:23:28.260]   I mean, you know, the thing is the thing that they, you know, they didn't, they didn't
[01:23:28.260 --> 01:23:32.700]   immediately go against the idea that, that they can do this.
[01:23:32.700 --> 01:23:35.740]   I mean, I think that they were looking at it as a, okay, sure, if you want to do that,
[01:23:35.740 --> 01:23:37.460]   we're not going to do anything down that path again.
[01:23:37.460 --> 01:23:38.460]   It's not a big deal.
[01:23:38.460 --> 01:23:41.340]   It's when he started asking for Wayne more than he was given.
[01:23:41.340 --> 01:23:44.580]   In this e-book findings, does he have to meet with Johnny Ive?
[01:23:44.580 --> 01:23:47.460]   Does he have to meet with every member of the board, including Al Gore?
[01:23:47.460 --> 01:23:53.060]   I mean, do, do any of these people really have anything material to contribute to the,
[01:23:53.060 --> 01:23:54.060]   the findings here?
[01:23:54.060 --> 01:23:55.060]   I don't know.
[01:23:55.060 --> 01:23:57.060]   I don't know.
[01:23:57.060 --> 01:24:01.300]   So you are at a line.
[01:24:01.300 --> 01:24:02.300]   It's absurd.
[01:24:02.300 --> 01:24:03.300]   I'm not out of order.
[01:24:03.300 --> 01:24:04.860]   You're out of order.
[01:24:04.860 --> 01:24:07.660]   If the judge isn't careful, it'll cost her her career.
[01:24:07.660 --> 01:24:09.100]   You know, really it's that big a deal.
[01:24:09.100 --> 01:24:10.700]   I mean, I, there are some drums.
[01:24:10.700 --> 01:24:14.700]   If they prove that she has that she made a declarative, if she made a declarative ruling
[01:24:14.700 --> 01:24:18.340]   that said that she hasn't been meeting with him and she has in any way, shape or form.
[01:24:18.340 --> 01:24:19.540]   Apparently, that's perjury.
[01:24:19.540 --> 01:24:23.020]   His testimony contradicted hers because he said, no, she didn't.
[01:24:23.020 --> 01:24:24.020]   She told me to do this.
[01:24:24.020 --> 01:24:25.020]   What?
[01:24:25.020 --> 01:24:30.980]   I'm just saying, there's a, and then obviously I told him I didn't talk to you.
[01:24:30.980 --> 01:24:31.980]   Come on.
[01:24:31.980 --> 01:24:35.780]   There's a lot of, there's a lot of details there and it may be within, within range
[01:24:35.780 --> 01:24:40.260]   there, but, but it's a, but it's, I mean, she's in, she's in, she's in, gotten herself
[01:24:40.260 --> 01:24:42.260]   into a lot of hot, you know.
[01:24:42.260 --> 01:24:44.420]   Well, she's allowed them to make it about her if nothing else.
[01:24:44.420 --> 01:24:45.420]   What?
[01:24:45.420 --> 01:24:47.260]   She's allowed them to make it about her if nothing else.
[01:24:47.260 --> 01:24:49.820]   And if I was Apple's legal, I would make it all about her.
[01:24:49.820 --> 01:24:54.620]   And I just drag her for the next couple of years, you know, out through this process.
[01:24:54.620 --> 01:25:01.940]   Amir Afrati writing for the information, which is Jessica Lesson's new pay wall tech journal,
[01:25:01.940 --> 01:25:05.540]   which I paid for immediately, writes about, pardon me?
[01:25:05.540 --> 01:25:07.540]   I bought a month of information.
[01:25:07.540 --> 01:25:08.540]   I bought a year.
[01:25:08.540 --> 01:25:09.540]   I'm all in.
[01:25:09.540 --> 01:25:14.940]   He, Amir's, who's very well connected, writing about free agents in Silicon Valley, of course,
[01:25:14.940 --> 01:25:20.660]   number one is that guy, Scott forced all, wondering what Scott's up to is living in
[01:25:20.660 --> 01:25:22.860]   the Bay Area, apparently advising.
[01:25:22.860 --> 01:25:26.500]   Well, he's traveled to Italy and South Africa.
[01:25:26.500 --> 01:25:29.580]   Occasional appearances at the Silicon Valley networking events.
[01:25:29.580 --> 01:25:33.500]   He's advising companies and becoming more active in philanthropy.
[01:25:33.500 --> 01:25:39.100]   Perhaps a job at Kleiner Perkins, but Amir says, he's got enough stock.
[01:25:39.100 --> 01:25:42.940]   The rest of work, he doesn't have to work, but Amir says Apple insider says Scott likes
[01:25:42.940 --> 01:25:45.020]   to build products.
[01:25:45.020 --> 01:25:47.260]   So he's probably looking for a startup to get involved in.
[01:25:47.260 --> 01:25:48.260]   I would guess.
[01:25:48.260 --> 01:25:51.100]   I don't know if it would be a startup though, because, you know, like he doesn't strike
[01:25:51.100 --> 01:25:55.260]   me as a burlant, Sir Lake kind of guy who wants to do the ridiculously long involved
[01:25:55.260 --> 01:25:59.300]   hours, but maybe, you know, a company that he could turn around and reshape in his image
[01:25:59.300 --> 01:26:01.940]   and sort of do what he did with iOS would be really interesting.
[01:26:01.940 --> 01:26:05.980]   He should get a job like working for like Gulfstream.
[01:26:05.980 --> 01:26:08.780]   He could do those, the leather stitching on the seat.
[01:26:08.780 --> 01:26:09.780]   That was Steve.
[01:26:09.780 --> 01:26:10.780]   Yeah, that was Steve.
[01:26:10.780 --> 01:26:11.780]   See, that's the thing.
[01:26:11.780 --> 01:26:16.020]   Scott Forest Hall got this really bad reputation, especially towards the end of making iOS.
[01:26:16.020 --> 01:26:19.460]   Scott Forest Hall was an implementation of Steve Jobs' will.
[01:26:19.460 --> 01:26:23.500]   His best talent was that he could figure out what Steve wanted and give it to him with
[01:26:23.500 --> 01:26:25.500]   like the least amount of work possible.
[01:26:25.500 --> 01:26:29.820]   That's really huge because a lot of people would like send Steve stuff and they get
[01:26:29.820 --> 01:26:31.940]   an email back saying no.
[01:26:31.940 --> 01:26:35.180]   And you know, it's hard to deal with, but Scott would have a basic idea what Steve wanted
[01:26:35.180 --> 01:26:37.540]   and help everybody get there.
[01:26:37.540 --> 01:26:41.580]   And that, you know, that Steve's Gulfstream jet and Steve picked all those textures.
[01:26:41.580 --> 01:26:46.380]   And Scott got us, you know, carbon and he got us the App Store and he did a lot of really
[01:26:46.380 --> 01:26:50.180]   good stuff and it's interesting to see where, you know, where that kind of drive.
[01:26:50.180 --> 01:26:56.940]   Like without Steve Jobs, if you had a mentor, disciple sort of relationship, how that disciple
[01:26:56.940 --> 01:27:00.500]   does next when he doesn't have that sort of thing to bounce off of anymore is really interesting
[01:27:00.500 --> 01:27:02.140]   to me.
[01:27:02.140 --> 01:27:06.260]   And by the way, according to pizza box in the chatroom, Steve Jobs went to Italy right
[01:27:06.260 --> 01:27:07.460]   after he was fired at Apple.
[01:27:07.460 --> 01:27:09.660]   So that's the place to go.
[01:27:09.660 --> 01:27:12.260]   So now he's going to start next next.
[01:27:12.260 --> 01:27:13.260]   Yeah.
[01:27:13.260 --> 01:27:14.260]   All right.
[01:27:14.260 --> 01:27:15.260]   Nope.
[01:27:15.260 --> 01:27:21.580]   But one don't be product of the week Ryan Seacrest wanted a keyboard for his iPhone.
[01:27:21.580 --> 01:27:25.020]   So he invested a million dollars in one.
[01:27:25.020 --> 01:27:26.020]   It's snap.
[01:27:26.020 --> 01:27:27.020]   It's a case.
[01:27:27.020 --> 01:27:28.020]   It snaps into your iPhone.
[01:27:28.020 --> 01:27:29.500]   It's called the typo keyboard.
[01:27:29.500 --> 01:27:32.620]   It'll be shown the CES in a couple of weeks.
[01:27:32.620 --> 01:27:35.740]   He just buy all the leftover blackberry bolts and hollow them out.
[01:27:35.740 --> 01:27:38.460]   It is really ugly.
[01:27:38.460 --> 01:27:41.140]   I can't imagine anybody besides Ryan wanting one.
[01:27:41.140 --> 01:27:43.100]   Am I wrong?
[01:27:43.100 --> 01:27:49.180]   This is this is the sort of thing where you imagine the episode of Shark Tank where they
[01:27:49.180 --> 01:27:53.180]   get about 30 seconds of the demo and like all three were like, I'm out.
[01:27:53.180 --> 01:27:54.180]   Yeah.
[01:27:54.180 --> 01:28:01.060]   This is about the I'm glad that such a product would exist for the 18 people before they die.
[01:28:01.060 --> 01:28:02.540]   I want to read a lot of people.
[01:28:02.540 --> 01:28:04.100]   Let me read from the press release.
[01:28:04.100 --> 01:28:07.900]   Maybe this will help you understand what the need, why the need is the backstory of
[01:28:07.900 --> 01:28:11.900]   Seacrest interest in this for many of his friends and colleagues carrying two phones
[01:28:11.900 --> 01:28:18.060]   was a habit, one for typing and correspondence and an iPhone for virtually everything else.
[01:28:18.060 --> 01:28:22.220]   One night, Ryan and his friend Lawrence Hall, your CEO of Show Media were out to dinner and
[01:28:22.220 --> 01:28:24.180]   both had phones on the table.
[01:28:24.180 --> 01:28:26.940]   Two people, four phones.
[01:28:26.940 --> 01:28:32.140]   So Ryan said, why do I need two phones when I could just glue a keyboard to my iPhone?
[01:28:32.140 --> 01:28:37.020]   Oh, there's a lot of, I mean, we do a lot of, we have an office now in DC and we spend
[01:28:37.020 --> 01:28:38.020]   a lot of time in DC.
[01:28:38.020 --> 01:28:39.340]   There's a lot of people with blackberries.
[01:28:39.340 --> 01:28:43.740]   I mean, that's not because they like the keyboard.
[01:28:43.740 --> 01:28:47.740]   That's probably because they're very attached to it.
[01:28:47.740 --> 01:28:51.740]   They could just buy a blackberry Z10, but they don't.
[01:28:51.740 --> 01:28:55.700]   They want the iPhone operating system, but they want the keyboard because that keyboard
[01:28:55.700 --> 01:28:58.500]   that you saw there looks exactly like a blackberry keyboard.
[01:28:58.500 --> 01:28:59.500]   Yeah.
[01:28:59.500 --> 01:29:00.500]   I don't know.
[01:29:00.500 --> 01:29:03.100]   There's a tiny dome to keys and all.
[01:29:03.100 --> 01:29:07.220]   Yeah, this doesn't seem like the sort of investment that he's going to get his money
[01:29:07.220 --> 01:29:08.220]   back on.
[01:29:08.220 --> 01:29:13.860]   Yeah, it seems like he could hire like a 16 year old to type for him for, for less than
[01:29:13.860 --> 01:29:15.140]   a million bucks.
[01:29:15.140 --> 01:29:17.380]   I think he wouldn't even have to hire this 16 year old.
[01:29:17.380 --> 01:29:20.180]   Keyboard is probably an electoral property of blackberry too, so we'll see what happens
[01:29:20.180 --> 01:29:21.180]   with that.
[01:29:21.180 --> 01:29:22.180]   Oh, good point.
[01:29:22.180 --> 01:29:26.740]   Hey, I don't, I know you, uh, one of the sites that you've got, Renee Richie's crackberry,
[01:29:26.740 --> 01:29:30.580]   and I imagine given the fact that you're in Canada, you read with interest the business
[01:29:30.580 --> 01:29:33.500]   week, the bling, bling, bling, bling, bling, bling, bling, bling, bling, bling, bling, bling,
[01:29:33.500 --> 01:29:34.500]   bling, bling, bling, bling, bling, bling, bling, bling.
[01:29:34.500 --> 01:29:35.500]   Yeah, story, which I thought was really great.
[01:29:35.500 --> 01:29:37.700]   The rise and fall of blackberry and oral history.
[01:29:37.700 --> 01:29:41.460]   Felix Gillette, Jilllette, Diane Brady and Carolyn Winter, and they talked to a lot of
[01:29:41.460 --> 01:29:45.400]   people, and it was just, it was kind of really great to read this, frankly.
[01:29:45.400 --> 01:29:46.400]   I really enjoyed it.
[01:29:46.400 --> 01:29:52.340]   And it reminded me of how much I loved the blackberry, uh, I think I had a 350 before
[01:29:52.340 --> 01:29:55.840]   the iPhone and I had a blackberry curve before the iPhone.
[01:29:55.840 --> 01:29:58.640]   My good friend and boss Kevin Mitchell look is quoted extensively in there.
[01:29:58.640 --> 01:29:59.640]   Oh, really?
[01:29:59.640 --> 01:30:00.480]   Oh, yeah.
[01:30:00.480 --> 01:30:01.480]   I did see that.
[01:30:01.480 --> 01:30:03.480]   I had a blackberry storm.
[01:30:03.480 --> 01:30:04.480]   Oh, no.
[01:30:04.480 --> 01:30:06.480]   The storm was really horrible.
[01:30:06.480 --> 01:30:08.480]   It was the most horrible.
[01:30:08.480 --> 01:30:12.200]   That was actually really horrible.
[01:30:12.200 --> 01:30:14.040]   But this is a really great story.
[01:30:14.040 --> 01:30:20.520]   And it's a sad story because, um, you know, it sounds like, first I thought, oh, you know,
[01:30:20.520 --> 01:30:24.960]   they just were killed as companies off an hour because in 2007, along came a much better
[01:30:24.960 --> 01:30:29.280]   thing called the iPhone and I switched from my crackberry to an iPhone and along with
[01:30:29.280 --> 01:30:30.280]   millions of other people.
[01:30:30.280 --> 01:30:31.280]   And it was just inevitable.
[01:30:31.280 --> 01:30:32.520]   I left my trio.
[01:30:32.520 --> 01:30:37.520]   But if you read it, it seems like there was also on the part of blackberry kind of, um,
[01:30:37.520 --> 01:30:39.560]   they just, they ignored the writing on the wall.
[01:30:39.560 --> 01:30:41.400]   They didn't respond to it.
[01:30:41.400 --> 01:30:43.200]   They got made a lot of really bad.
[01:30:43.200 --> 01:30:45.960]   Like there's this old Buddha saying that the knife hurts twice when you're stabbed and
[01:30:45.960 --> 01:30:50.400]   when you react to it and like the iPhone came out and their reaction was like, it was
[01:30:50.400 --> 01:30:51.400]   like they ignored it.
[01:30:51.400 --> 01:30:55.120]   They thought people were going to prefer data compression and keyboards to the iPhone.
[01:30:55.120 --> 01:30:59.480]   And the iPad came out and they switched the playbook from being a companion, like a folio
[01:30:59.480 --> 01:31:02.720]   kind of device to being a full on tablet, but they had no resources.
[01:31:02.720 --> 01:31:05.520]   They have to put the phones on hold for a year to make the tablet and they didn't finish
[01:31:05.520 --> 01:31:06.520]   the tablet.
[01:31:06.520 --> 01:31:10.320]   Their phones got a year behind just one thing after another, um, you know, Verizon wanted
[01:31:10.320 --> 01:31:14.080]   the storm and then AT&T wanted a torch and neither of them were successful.
[01:31:14.080 --> 01:31:17.600]   And over and over again, they made really, really bad choices and that put them further
[01:31:17.600 --> 01:31:20.520]   and further behind and it made a lot, you know, more and more pressure to make more and
[01:31:20.520 --> 01:31:21.520]   more bad choices.
[01:31:21.520 --> 01:31:24.240]   I, I, I, I, there's a great article which I highly recommend.
[01:31:24.240 --> 01:31:30.400]   I, I put it in my pocket, but they talked to one of the big sources, Gary Musso, who
[01:31:30.400 --> 01:31:37.280]   was the eighth employee at Ramen Musso talks about a, an all hands meeting where somebody
[01:31:37.280 --> 01:31:40.120]   asked about, well, what, you know, what's going on with R&D?
[01:31:40.120 --> 01:31:46.080]   I can't find it, but but in, and basically Musso says the attitude was, well, R&D is
[01:31:46.080 --> 01:31:50.720]   something you do when, you know, you're not doing something real and we aren't doing any
[01:31:50.720 --> 01:31:51.720]   R&D.
[01:31:51.720 --> 01:31:52.720]   And of course this was 2007.
[01:31:52.720 --> 01:31:55.360]   Little R&D might have helped.
[01:31:55.360 --> 01:31:59.120]   A little competitive research anyway.
[01:31:59.120 --> 01:32:06.920]   Um, yeah, I'm sad because I really, the Blackberry pager I had, I loved, I loved it.
[01:32:06.920 --> 01:32:10.840]   I can't say the same for the curve, but, um, no, I never had them.
[01:32:10.840 --> 01:32:15.120]   They released, they released the curve with a non working browser.
[01:32:15.120 --> 01:32:18.080]   Like the brothers just didn't work.
[01:32:18.080 --> 01:32:19.480]   And you can't do that.
[01:32:19.480 --> 01:32:24.640]   You gotta pay attention, even, even a big company on top of the world.
[01:32:24.640 --> 01:32:26.280]   You start letting the little things slip.
[01:32:26.280 --> 01:32:28.400]   It shows you how fast mobile can change.
[01:32:28.400 --> 01:32:29.400]   Yeah.
[01:32:29.400 --> 01:32:33.320]   We went from Nokia, like it was a Symbian, Windows phone and Windows mobile and Blackberry
[01:32:33.320 --> 01:32:36.960]   and Trio owning the world to none of those being really functional companies or existing
[01:32:36.960 --> 01:32:38.160]   operating systems anymore.
[01:32:38.160 --> 01:32:39.160]   Exactly.
[01:32:39.160 --> 01:32:42.120]   Hey, we're going to do our picks of the week in just a bit.
[01:32:42.120 --> 01:32:45.920]   You're watching Mac break weekly with Chris Breen, the hair of Breen.
[01:32:45.920 --> 01:32:47.560]   You don't do the hair of Breen on Twitter.
[01:32:47.560 --> 01:32:49.240]   You do the body of Breen on Twitter, right?
[01:32:49.240 --> 01:32:50.240]   No, I'm the body of Breen.
[01:32:50.240 --> 01:32:52.040]   The hair of Breen is somebody else.
[01:32:52.040 --> 01:32:56.120]   And as we might expect the life of its own.
[01:32:56.120 --> 01:32:57.120]   Yes.
[01:32:57.120 --> 01:32:58.120]   Yeah.
[01:32:58.120 --> 01:33:03.440]   I really, I'm growing my hair long and when I just showed the hairdresser a picture of
[01:33:03.440 --> 01:33:04.440]   you.
[01:33:04.440 --> 01:33:05.440]   Yeah.
[01:33:05.440 --> 01:33:08.640]   And I said, this is where I want to end up.
[01:33:08.640 --> 01:33:10.160]   You know, you could try.
[01:33:10.160 --> 01:33:13.280]   I see, you know, Craig Fedorigiad at Apple.
[01:33:13.280 --> 01:33:14.280]   He's close.
[01:33:14.280 --> 01:33:17.680]   He keeps trying, he keeps trying, but there's a lot of product in there.
[01:33:17.680 --> 01:33:19.560]   And you just can't do it through product.
[01:33:19.560 --> 01:33:20.560]   You have to be born to it.
[01:33:20.560 --> 01:33:21.560]   It's got to be organic.
[01:33:21.560 --> 01:33:22.560]   Yeah.
[01:33:22.560 --> 01:33:23.560]   Yeah.
[01:33:23.560 --> 01:33:24.560]   Yeah.
[01:33:24.560 --> 01:33:25.560]   Macworld.com, the Mac 911.
[01:33:25.560 --> 01:33:26.560]   He's the Mac Daddy.
[01:33:26.560 --> 01:33:28.080]   And he and I go from the Chicago Sun.
[01:33:28.080 --> 01:33:30.560]   Times are now richy of imore.com.
[01:33:30.560 --> 01:33:33.200]   And of course, Alex Lindsey back from his.
[01:33:33.200 --> 01:33:36.480]   I'm going to from now on, I'm just going to call you the parapetetic Alex Lindsey.
[01:33:36.480 --> 01:33:37.480]   Parapetetic.
[01:33:37.480 --> 01:33:38.680]   Is that all right?
[01:33:38.680 --> 01:33:39.680]   Parapetetic.
[01:33:39.680 --> 01:33:40.680]   Parapetetic.
[01:33:40.680 --> 01:33:42.680]   People have to look it up every time I introduce you what?
[01:33:42.680 --> 01:33:43.680]   Parapetit.
[01:33:43.680 --> 01:33:44.920]   But he has all his legs.
[01:33:44.920 --> 01:33:46.560]   No, I'm talking about you travel a lot.
[01:33:46.560 --> 01:33:47.560]   I do.
[01:33:47.560 --> 01:33:48.560]   What?
[01:33:48.560 --> 01:33:50.240]   Just, you know, well, okay.
[01:33:50.240 --> 01:33:51.240]   Okay.
[01:33:51.240 --> 01:33:54.200]   Last time you were here, you said you were going to Hollywood for a big motion picture
[01:33:54.200 --> 01:33:55.680]   hangout.
[01:33:55.680 --> 01:33:58.880]   And then I saw the hangout and I said, yeah, that was big.
[01:33:58.880 --> 01:33:59.880]   Wow.
[01:33:59.880 --> 01:34:00.880]   That was exciting.
[01:34:00.880 --> 01:34:02.520]   Can I, is it allowed or no?
[01:34:02.520 --> 01:34:03.520]   No, let's not say.
[01:34:03.520 --> 01:34:04.520]   I'm talking about specifically.
[01:34:04.520 --> 01:34:06.360]   Where are you going next?
[01:34:06.360 --> 01:34:08.760]   I may leave this afternoon for India.
[01:34:08.760 --> 01:34:09.760]   So we'll say wow.
[01:34:09.760 --> 01:34:13.080]   So we'll, I'm not sure yet where any either that I'm here for next week and half.
[01:34:13.080 --> 01:34:14.080]   Good.
[01:34:14.080 --> 01:34:15.080]   Delly would like to have you though.
[01:34:15.080 --> 01:34:19.160]   So either I either have to go get my visa or, or I'm going to hang out for another week
[01:34:19.160 --> 01:34:20.160]   and half.
[01:34:20.160 --> 01:34:21.160]   So we'll see.
[01:34:21.160 --> 01:34:22.160]   So what's this may thing?
[01:34:22.160 --> 01:34:24.640]   I mean, you just on standby and you're just going to hang out at the airport so you have
[01:34:24.640 --> 01:34:28.800]   a seat and then like we're trying to decide whether we saw but locally or whether I go
[01:34:28.800 --> 01:34:29.800]   handle it.
[01:34:29.800 --> 01:34:31.800]   It's, it's the fixture profile.
[01:34:31.800 --> 01:34:37.160]   So it's just, you remember in, you know, it's hard fiction.
[01:34:37.160 --> 01:34:38.160]   Mr. Wolf.
[01:34:38.160 --> 01:34:41.680]   Well, there's, so there's, there's a key.
[01:34:41.680 --> 01:34:44.720]   There's some skill sets within our company that there's like two or three of us that can
[01:34:44.720 --> 01:34:45.720]   do and there's 40.
[01:34:45.720 --> 01:34:46.720]   I have some very particular skittles.
[01:34:46.720 --> 01:34:49.720]   There's a lot to do with hanging out.
[01:34:49.720 --> 01:34:54.800]   You know, so, like, like Leon Neeson was like, you know, like he was like torturing people
[01:34:54.800 --> 01:34:56.440]   and I'm just like, Hey, let's hang out.
[01:34:56.440 --> 01:35:01.600]   So let's, you know, so, no, so, no, it's just like when you deal with certain complex
[01:35:01.600 --> 01:35:04.000]   pieces that there's only a couple of us in the company that can do it.
[01:35:04.000 --> 01:35:07.000]   So we're, so we have to always decide who's going to, who's going to go and we'll still
[01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:08.000]   try to come out.
[01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:13.480]   Well, he suggests some new adjectives, the wanderer, the nomadic Alex Lindsay, the fangabond
[01:35:13.480 --> 01:35:14.480]   Alex Lindsay.
[01:35:14.480 --> 01:35:15.480]   Exactly.
[01:35:15.480 --> 01:35:16.480]   Exactly.
[01:35:16.480 --> 01:35:17.480]   The vagrant Alex Lindsay.
[01:35:17.480 --> 01:35:22.680]   Alex, if you, if you were cast as a cast member on the Amazing Race, how would anybody
[01:35:22.680 --> 01:35:23.680]   know?
[01:35:23.680 --> 01:35:24.680]   Exactly.
[01:35:24.680 --> 01:35:26.520]   Sometimes it feels that way.
[01:35:26.520 --> 01:35:27.520]   Yeah.
[01:35:27.520 --> 01:35:29.560]   Sometimes it feels that way.
[01:35:29.560 --> 01:35:32.800]   Our show today brought to you by the great folks at Shutterstock.com.
[01:35:32.800 --> 01:35:37.040]   When the time comes and you will know where you need a perfect image or video for your
[01:35:37.040 --> 01:35:42.720]   project, whether a website, a publication, an advertisement, a video, I want you to think
[01:35:42.720 --> 01:35:47.160]   about Shutterstock.com, over 30 million.
[01:35:47.160 --> 01:35:48.160]   That's right.
[01:35:48.160 --> 01:35:55.080]   30, it's 31 million, 704,800 and 882, royalty free stock images.
[01:35:55.080 --> 01:36:01.200]   Over one and a half million royalty free stock videos, check that footage tab at the top.
[01:36:01.200 --> 01:36:04.840]   I got to talk to them because I think sometimes people don't realize that the videos are there
[01:36:04.840 --> 01:36:05.840]   too.
[01:36:05.840 --> 01:36:09.600]   1.4 million beautiful high-def videos.
[01:36:09.600 --> 01:36:14.600]   And these are royalty free.
[01:36:14.600 --> 01:36:18.440]   You pay once and you can use them as you need in your PowerPoint presentation in your video,
[01:36:18.440 --> 01:36:19.440]   frankly.
[01:36:19.440 --> 01:36:20.440]   Why?
[01:36:20.440 --> 01:36:22.960]   I bet you could put a pretty decent film together with just stock footage.
[01:36:22.960 --> 01:36:23.960]   Wouldn't that be an interesting project?
[01:36:23.960 --> 01:36:25.960]   That would be a good challenge.
[01:36:25.960 --> 01:36:26.960]   Yeah.
[01:36:26.960 --> 01:36:27.960]   Do a trailer.
[01:36:27.960 --> 01:36:31.640]   Many contributors to Shutterstock are professional photographers and artists.
[01:36:31.640 --> 01:36:35.520]   Of course, Shutterstock reviews all the images individually for content and quality before
[01:36:35.520 --> 01:36:36.680]   they add them.
[01:36:36.680 --> 01:36:37.920]   And there's always something new.
[01:36:37.920 --> 01:36:39.520]   Oh, look at that wolf.
[01:36:39.520 --> 01:36:41.960]   Shutterstock ads 20 is the young and the weak.
[01:36:41.960 --> 01:36:46.760]   Yeah, I don't know if the wolf can cut a connection with the mother and child.
[01:36:46.760 --> 01:36:47.760]   That's interesting.
[01:36:47.760 --> 01:36:52.960]   I don't know whether going with that one or what you would use that, which presentation.
[01:36:52.960 --> 01:36:53.960]   That's what.
[01:36:53.960 --> 01:36:58.720]   But then the hungry apple-eyed blackberry walking down the road.
[01:36:58.720 --> 01:37:02.160]   Shutterstock ads 20,000, actually more than 20,000 images every day.
[01:37:02.160 --> 01:37:03.440]   So there's always something new.
[01:37:03.440 --> 01:37:05.280]   Now I also use it for inspiration.
[01:37:05.280 --> 01:37:07.120]   And you can do that absolutely free.
[01:37:07.120 --> 01:37:09.440]   And an image, looking at an image.
[01:37:09.440 --> 01:37:13.240]   Well, actually some of our fans used that wolf as inspiration.
[01:37:13.240 --> 01:37:14.240]   Oh, let me see.
[01:37:14.240 --> 01:37:18.440]   Yeah, they've actually made this small video for us.
[01:37:18.440 --> 01:37:20.720]   It's pretty epic.
[01:37:20.720 --> 01:37:28.680]   This is from Shutterstock footage.
[01:37:28.680 --> 01:37:36.680]   This is the Herman Cain American snow dog.
[01:37:36.680 --> 01:37:41.680]   I don't get it, but I'm sure that that is that a viral thing?
[01:37:41.680 --> 01:37:43.000]   It's a twit viral thing.
[01:37:43.000 --> 01:37:45.280]   That's an inside joke from that.
[01:37:45.280 --> 01:37:50.880]   This I forget which show it originated on, but this has been an NSFW.
[01:37:50.880 --> 01:37:51.880]   Yeah, the dog.
[01:37:51.880 --> 01:37:52.880]   It's from NSFW.
[01:37:52.880 --> 01:37:54.120]   NSFW, of course.
[01:37:54.120 --> 01:37:55.120]   Of course.
[01:37:55.120 --> 01:37:56.120]   This is the beauty part.
[01:37:56.120 --> 01:37:58.920]   If you don't mind the Shutterstock watermark, you can use it.
[01:37:58.920 --> 01:38:01.760]   I think we just created a new standard where everyone just starts running ads with the
[01:38:01.760 --> 01:38:02.760]   Shutterstock water.
[01:38:02.760 --> 01:38:03.760]   What the hell?
[01:38:03.760 --> 01:38:04.760]   You know, go ahead.
[01:38:04.760 --> 01:38:06.760]   There's your Pepsi ad with the Shutterstock load line.
[01:38:06.760 --> 01:38:10.120]   The nice thing is you can throw this stuff in the light boxes and use it as inspiration.
[01:38:10.120 --> 01:38:12.480]   You have to create a free account, but you don't need to give them a credit card to do
[01:38:12.480 --> 01:38:13.480]   that.
[01:38:13.480 --> 01:38:15.480]   There's a great iPad app, which really is good.
[01:38:15.480 --> 01:38:17.160]   I mean, it just looks, I have it.
[01:38:17.160 --> 01:38:19.440]   It's just gorgeous.
[01:38:19.440 --> 01:38:24.080]   And one of the ways that I use a lot of stock, we've had to build a lot of presentations
[01:38:24.080 --> 01:38:25.560]   for people and videos.
[01:38:25.560 --> 01:38:30.440]   We'll go up to a stock agency and just throw in a whole bunch of images that have all the
[01:38:30.440 --> 01:38:32.840]   watermarks on them and we cut them out and do everything we can do.
[01:38:32.840 --> 01:38:33.840]   Just spec it.
[01:38:33.840 --> 01:38:34.840]   The client says, oh, yeah, yeah.
[01:38:34.840 --> 01:38:37.480]   And a lot of times the client just says, yeah, we like everything that's there and then
[01:38:37.480 --> 01:38:38.480]   we just go buy them.
[01:38:38.480 --> 01:38:40.920]   We don't have to buy them until we're everything about downloading them.
[01:38:40.920 --> 01:38:42.400]   Lightbox will do that for you.
[01:38:42.400 --> 01:38:43.400]   Yeah.
[01:38:43.400 --> 01:38:47.320]   So the Shutterstock app looks like something like 500px or something like just some gorgeous
[01:38:47.320 --> 01:38:48.320]   photo app.
[01:38:48.320 --> 01:38:50.080]   Can you have that shot?
[01:38:50.080 --> 01:38:51.080]   There it is.
[01:38:51.080 --> 01:38:53.720]   So they always have new, these are all basically light boxes.
[01:38:53.720 --> 01:38:55.160]   So featured light boxes.
[01:38:55.160 --> 01:38:57.960]   Here's a high contrast featured light box.
[01:38:57.960 --> 01:39:00.560]   So this is just fun to play with this stuff.
[01:39:00.560 --> 01:39:01.880]   You could share these with colleagues.
[01:39:01.880 --> 01:39:03.560]   You can use it for inspiration.
[01:39:03.560 --> 01:39:04.560]   I encourage you.
[01:39:04.560 --> 01:39:06.280]   Oh, hey, we were there.
[01:39:06.280 --> 01:39:07.600]   That's Santorini.
[01:39:07.600 --> 01:39:09.440]   That's that picture.
[01:39:09.440 --> 01:39:10.440]   I took that.
[01:39:10.440 --> 01:39:13.000]   They lead you to that on the tour of San Dorini of Yia.
[01:39:13.000 --> 01:39:16.480]   And they say, there's the dome that you always see when you see a picture of Greece.
[01:39:16.480 --> 01:39:17.480]   That's it.
[01:39:17.480 --> 01:39:19.240]   I've been there on that.
[01:39:19.240 --> 01:39:23.040]   Anyway, I think you're going to love Shutterstock, the great search engine, the multilingual
[01:39:23.040 --> 01:39:24.360]   customer support.
[01:39:24.360 --> 01:39:26.040]   We are an international podcast.
[01:39:26.040 --> 01:39:28.320]   We're heard all over the world of so is Shutterstock.
[01:39:28.320 --> 01:39:32.760]   More than a dozen countries, full-time customer support, multilingual support throughout the
[01:39:32.760 --> 01:39:33.760]   week.
[01:39:33.760 --> 01:39:34.760]   I want you to try it.
[01:39:34.760 --> 01:39:35.760]   Just set up a free account there.
[01:39:35.760 --> 01:39:41.880]   If you decide to buy before you buy, remember to use our offer code MACBreak1213 on checkout.
[01:39:41.880 --> 01:39:44.480]   MACBreak, it's December 2013, right?
[01:39:44.480 --> 01:39:47.200]   So MACBreak1213 on one word.
[01:39:47.200 --> 01:39:48.920]   And you'll get-- I mean, this is a good deal.
[01:39:48.920 --> 01:39:50.240]   25% off any package.
[01:39:50.240 --> 01:39:56.880]   I recommend the subscription package because that way we have a subscription for 25 images
[01:39:56.880 --> 01:39:59.680]   a day and you're going to save a whole lot of money.
[01:39:59.680 --> 01:40:05.320]   25% off offer code MACBreak1213.
[01:40:05.320 --> 01:40:06.320]   I've been hiding.
[01:40:06.320 --> 01:40:08.760]   Let's go back to Andy.
[01:40:08.760 --> 01:40:09.760]   I like him.
[01:40:09.760 --> 01:40:11.760]   He's a smiling Andy in aco.
[01:40:11.760 --> 01:40:17.880]   Now, if you don't have the Shutterstock watermark, you're going to have to pay for that picture.
[01:40:17.880 --> 01:40:19.920]   Andy, why don't you start with your pick of the week?
[01:40:19.920 --> 01:40:21.600]   I got a pick, but first--
[01:40:21.600 --> 01:40:24.960]   Oh, you're going to take it apart for us?
[01:40:24.960 --> 01:40:25.960]   There you go.
[01:40:25.960 --> 01:40:29.480]   Yeah, it's the simple-- those of us who are old-timers remember how difficult it was
[01:40:29.480 --> 01:40:34.560]   to get inside, like original MAC Plus where you need the special weird tools and the special
[01:40:34.560 --> 01:40:35.560]   thing.
[01:40:35.560 --> 01:40:36.560]   You weren't supposed to.
[01:40:36.560 --> 01:40:37.720]   Yeah, that's where I first experienced Torx.
[01:40:37.720 --> 01:40:39.280]   This is how cool and how easy this one is.
[01:40:39.280 --> 01:40:43.080]   So there's the really awesome, cool acrylic design.
[01:40:43.080 --> 01:40:45.440]   Yours is not cracked, it looks like.
[01:40:45.440 --> 01:40:48.080]   Well, but almost never the more because it was just like some--
[01:40:48.080 --> 01:40:49.080]   Oh, mine was cracked.
[01:40:49.080 --> 01:40:50.080]   That was a big--
[01:40:50.080 --> 01:40:51.080]   Okay.
[01:40:51.080 --> 01:40:52.080]   You think they weren't cracks?
[01:40:52.080 --> 01:40:55.760]   Well, some of them-- I think a lot of people looked at-- heard about the cracks and then
[01:40:55.760 --> 01:40:57.840]   they saw like the mold seams in the corners.
[01:40:57.840 --> 01:40:58.840]   No, no, mine was cracked.
[01:40:58.840 --> 01:40:59.840]   Oh, mine's cracked.
[01:40:59.840 --> 01:41:00.840]   Mine's cracked.
[01:41:00.840 --> 01:41:01.840]   Mine's cracked.
[01:41:01.840 --> 01:41:02.840]   It's the apple, it helped me.
[01:41:02.840 --> 01:41:03.840]   And I bought mine on the last day of availability.
[01:41:03.840 --> 01:41:07.840]   The day I got it home, they announced they canceled it.
[01:41:07.840 --> 01:41:10.080]   And this is the beginning of Apple retail--
[01:41:10.080 --> 01:41:11.720]   Tradition, that's right.
[01:41:11.720 --> 01:41:15.840]   Two sign waves out of phase with each other.
[01:41:15.840 --> 01:41:20.680]   So you got this cool stuff and then when you want to upgrade memory, upgrade hard drive.
[01:41:20.680 --> 01:41:24.400]   Now kids, there was a time when you could actually upgrade the memory and the hard drive
[01:41:24.400 --> 01:41:27.880]   or the storage inside of Mac and Josh's computer trying not to let that freak you out as you
[01:41:27.880 --> 01:41:28.880]   see what happens.
[01:41:28.880 --> 01:41:34.480]   So you turn it upside down and you see this really cool spring loaded handle and then
[01:41:34.480 --> 01:41:35.480]   you go, "Cah!"
[01:41:35.480 --> 01:41:36.480]   "Cah!"
[01:41:36.480 --> 01:41:39.480]   "You're right, you're a reactor whore."
[01:41:39.480 --> 01:41:41.280]   "And there it is."
[01:41:41.280 --> 01:41:43.280]   "Wow, that's awesome."
[01:41:43.280 --> 01:41:45.280]   "I feel myself going, Dave."
[01:41:45.280 --> 01:41:46.280]   "Hello."
[01:41:46.280 --> 01:41:48.280]   "I am an Apple G4Q."
[01:41:48.280 --> 01:41:49.680]   Did Johnny and I do that?
[01:41:49.680 --> 01:41:50.680]   "I don't know."
[01:41:50.680 --> 01:41:51.680]   "You have so, I don't know."
[01:41:51.680 --> 01:41:52.680]   He did.
[01:41:52.680 --> 01:41:58.480]   I have queued up the video of the Apple announcement and after--
[01:41:58.480 --> 01:41:59.480]   "There really isn't this guy."
[01:41:59.480 --> 01:42:02.080]   "Recrucer to the new Mac Pro."
[01:42:02.080 --> 01:42:06.280]   You get Johnny Ive speaking about ripping it right out.
[01:42:06.280 --> 01:42:07.280]   "Who is that guy?
[01:42:07.280 --> 01:42:08.280]   I don't know."
[01:42:08.280 --> 01:42:09.280]   There you go, there's Johnny Ive.
[01:42:09.280 --> 01:42:10.280]   "Before I had white."
[01:42:10.280 --> 01:42:13.880]   "It rises from the top of the cube just on the magic."
[01:42:13.880 --> 01:42:17.280]   "You flip it over, there's this little latch that you hit and it pops up and you can pull
[01:42:17.280 --> 01:42:21.480]   the entire core out and almost looks like this nuclear reactor core.
[01:42:21.480 --> 01:42:23.880]   You know something that you see in mission impossible."
[01:42:23.880 --> 01:42:24.880]   "The cloud."
[01:42:24.880 --> 01:42:28.280]   "This is the access to all the RAM, to the airport cards, to the graphics cards.
[01:42:28.280 --> 01:42:31.200]   You don't have to then say, 'I'm going to upgrade the memory.
[01:42:31.200 --> 01:42:33.880]   What expert am I going to have to find?'
[01:42:33.880 --> 01:42:34.880]   "It's something that's--"
[01:42:34.880 --> 01:42:36.880]   "Was this Steve Jobs production somewhere?"
[01:42:36.880 --> 01:42:39.880]   "Oh, there he is, Phil Mueller."
[01:42:39.880 --> 01:42:42.080]   "You have a professional new mouse.
[01:42:42.080 --> 01:42:44.880]   It's optical, so there's nothing to clog or jam."
[01:42:44.880 --> 01:42:49.680]   "We reduced the speakers to an elemental form, the sphere, and the good--"
[01:42:49.680 --> 01:42:50.680]   "Very subtle."
[01:42:50.680 --> 01:42:52.680]   "I love Johnny Ive."
[01:42:52.680 --> 01:42:54.680]   [laughter]
[01:42:54.680 --> 01:42:58.880]   So, and you kept your-- see, I'm sad.
[01:42:58.880 --> 01:43:00.880]   I gave mine a mine-f you.
[01:43:00.880 --> 01:43:08.160]   Yeah, it's like it was-- you often have to wait a while before a computer design becomes
[01:43:08.160 --> 01:43:10.880]   so cool and classic that you wish you hadn't given away.
[01:43:10.880 --> 01:43:14.680]   This one though was, oh, that's just too cool.
[01:43:14.680 --> 01:43:19.360]   It was my working computer for maybe about a year because I didn't really need it.
[01:43:19.360 --> 01:43:21.440]   I just bought it because it was an opportunity.
[01:43:21.440 --> 01:43:27.360]   And then even then, I'm like, oh, no, just as a-- I buy so few nice things from my office.
[01:43:27.360 --> 01:43:31.880]   I will have the same sofa in my office I had in my first apartment after college, but I
[01:43:31.880 --> 01:43:36.080]   will have this kick-ass functional computer sculpture.
[01:43:36.080 --> 01:43:41.120]   If I can't own an Apollo disky computer, this is a close second in terms of coolness.
[01:43:41.120 --> 01:43:42.120]   Object.
[01:43:42.120 --> 01:43:49.200]   So, your epic-- my pick of the week is this simple unassuming bag.
[01:43:49.200 --> 01:43:54.480]   Now, this is actually ties in with something we're talking about earlier today about I-Bekins.
[01:43:54.480 --> 01:44:00.280]   This is from edec.com-- edec-- sorry, edec.df.com.
[01:44:00.280 --> 01:44:03.400]   This is their Black Hole Faraday bag.
[01:44:03.400 --> 01:44:05.160]   And it is a-- I got to admit it.
[01:44:05.160 --> 01:44:06.160]   That's a great name.
[01:44:06.160 --> 01:44:08.840]   It's a-- and-- yeah, exactly.
[01:44:08.840 --> 01:44:14.280]   It takes your wireless device and basically puts it inside a black hole.
[01:44:14.280 --> 01:44:16.080]   So here is my phone.
[01:44:16.080 --> 01:44:18.420]   Here's the signal strength I'm getting right now.
[01:44:18.420 --> 01:44:24.080]   If you drop it inside the black hole-- he said, there you go.
[01:44:24.080 --> 01:44:25.080]   Oops.
[01:44:25.080 --> 01:44:27.180]   Boink.
[01:44:27.180 --> 01:44:32.720]   And suddenly, I hope, it gets down to-- I can't see it because it's shaded, but trust me,
[01:44:32.720 --> 01:44:36.400]   the signal is down to-- now down to absolute zero.
[01:44:36.400 --> 01:44:39.000]   Oh, that's-- so that kills the signal.
[01:44:39.000 --> 01:44:40.000]   Exactly.
[01:44:40.000 --> 01:44:41.520]   It's completely shielded.
[01:44:41.520 --> 01:44:48.580]   You really do it, you actually fold it over once and then fold it over twice.
[01:44:48.580 --> 01:44:51.860]   And as a result, you get absolute-- I'll try it a third time.
[01:44:51.860 --> 01:44:52.860]   There you go.
[01:44:52.860 --> 01:44:56.460]   Absolutely no signal to speak of whatsoever on any radio.
[01:44:56.460 --> 01:45:00.140]   And what I like-- there are a bunch of-- I wanted to experiment with this sort of stuff
[01:45:00.140 --> 01:45:05.940]   because I don't think it's going to be a must-have item, but I think that there might
[01:45:05.940 --> 01:45:08.940]   be times in your future when you decide, you know what?
[01:45:08.940 --> 01:45:12.840]   This is kind of a weird place and I would much rather know that if I have my phone in my
[01:45:12.840 --> 01:45:16.800]   pocket, it can't be tracked throughout the small or throughout this whatever.
[01:45:16.800 --> 01:45:18.040]   So it's a nice thing to have.
[01:45:18.040 --> 01:45:22.600]   See, this is-- there's the only one that I tried that really does work.
[01:45:22.600 --> 01:45:27.440]   I mean, that you can buy these cheap ones off of Amazon that are like maybe $7, $8,
[01:45:27.440 --> 01:45:32.760]   and they're nice and shiny and silvery, but they don't actually make your phone invisible
[01:45:32.760 --> 01:45:34.120]   to the network.
[01:45:34.120 --> 01:45:35.120]   This one does.
[01:45:35.120 --> 01:45:38.840]   It is so serious, as a matter of fact, that if you look in the back, there are a couple
[01:45:38.840 --> 01:45:40.400]   of pouches here.
[01:45:40.400 --> 01:45:45.620]   Those pouches are there for evidence tags because they sell these to law enforcement.
[01:45:45.620 --> 01:45:51.060]   And so the reason why this has this clear window here is so that you can actually continue
[01:45:51.060 --> 01:45:54.700]   to operate the phone even while it's cut off from the network.
[01:45:54.700 --> 01:45:57.780]   So the multi-- multi-touch is not going to work.
[01:45:57.780 --> 01:46:00.780]   You might be able to tap things through the screen.
[01:46:00.780 --> 01:46:02.920]   You can certainly operate any mechanical button.
[01:46:02.920 --> 01:46:06.780]   So if you are, again, in one of those places where I don't want to be tracked through this
[01:46:06.780 --> 01:46:12.820]   small or whatever, you can still wake it up and get an address or an appointment time
[01:46:12.820 --> 01:46:15.020]   or whatever you need off of this.
[01:46:15.020 --> 01:46:20.260]   You can't, however, of course-- don't try to be clever and sort of keep the headphones
[01:46:20.260 --> 01:46:24.220]   plugged in and basically snake it through this because now you basically given it an
[01:46:24.220 --> 01:46:26.860]   antennas so that radio signals can get into it.
[01:46:26.860 --> 01:46:33.380]   But as I said, this might be an accessory that some people might be interested in.
[01:46:33.380 --> 01:46:37.780]   It does not cheat because it goes for about $60 on Amazon, but it actually works.
[01:46:37.780 --> 01:46:41.620]   And if you think that you're-- if you see an immediate future that is not paranoid in
[01:46:41.620 --> 01:46:46.660]   which you might want to be able to say, no way, no how can any retailer track me through
[01:46:46.660 --> 01:46:47.660]   this.
[01:46:47.660 --> 01:46:48.660]   I'm not scared about the government.
[01:46:48.660 --> 01:46:52.860]   Again, I'm scared about, you know, JCPenney saying, "Ooh, wow.
[01:46:52.860 --> 01:46:55.140]   He stopped in front of this place for 20 seconds.
[01:46:55.140 --> 01:46:56.860]   I'm going to try to sell him this.
[01:46:56.860 --> 01:47:01.180]   Maybe the only time he can get any piece whatsoever in life is if you have your phone
[01:47:01.180 --> 01:47:02.900]   in a Faraday bag in the future."
[01:47:02.900 --> 01:47:04.700]   That's what I'm thinking about right now.
[01:47:04.700 --> 01:47:09.020]   iPod Man in our chatroom said they need to rebrand it, the Ibekenbuster.
[01:47:09.020 --> 01:47:12.420]   Actually, there'd be a market for that, huh?
[01:47:12.420 --> 01:47:13.420]   The--
[01:47:13.420 --> 01:47:19.580]   You know, when I got my Fast Track, which is the RFID tag you put in your windows, you
[01:47:19.580 --> 01:47:23.940]   go through the toll, pays the toll, they give you a Mylar bag with it and they say, "If
[01:47:23.940 --> 01:47:27.220]   you don't want us to see your tag, put it in the bag."
[01:47:27.220 --> 01:47:31.060]   So I wonder if just a plain old Mylar bag would be as effective.
[01:47:31.060 --> 01:47:32.060]   Some of them work.
[01:47:32.060 --> 01:47:35.460]   The question is that it depends on how it's sealed.
[01:47:35.460 --> 01:47:37.900]   Believe it or not, air gaps are going to--
[01:47:37.900 --> 01:47:38.900]   It's interesting.
[01:47:38.900 --> 01:47:39.900]   There's a difference between it.
[01:47:39.900 --> 01:47:42.540]   It works most of the time and it works nearly all the time.
[01:47:42.540 --> 01:47:46.580]   Even this bag, I actually tested it out a little bit and tried-- I kept my phone inside
[01:47:46.580 --> 01:47:50.820]   here permanently for about like two days trying to look for places where I could get
[01:47:50.820 --> 01:47:52.340]   any signal whatsoever.
[01:47:52.340 --> 01:47:56.380]   And to be honest, there were a couple of places where I could see the needle twitch a
[01:47:56.380 --> 01:47:59.860]   little bit where it could see that there was something to connect to, but it couldn't
[01:47:59.860 --> 01:48:00.860]   connect to it.
[01:48:00.860 --> 01:48:07.620]   I don't know if that would be significant enough for data collection purposes, but it's good
[01:48:07.620 --> 01:48:12.260]   enough that if you either you want a solution to this or you don't want a solution to this,
[01:48:12.260 --> 01:48:17.020]   if you want a solution to this, get something that is designed so that-- the reason why it's
[01:48:17.020 --> 01:48:22.740]   an evidence tag is that this is so that if they collect a phone off of a suspect and
[01:48:22.740 --> 01:48:26.660]   they want to collect legally, I'm sure, collect data off of it without the person
[01:48:26.660 --> 01:48:30.540]   that's just like, "remote wiping the phone," this is how they do it.
[01:48:30.540 --> 01:48:31.540]   So it's the best one.
[01:48:31.540 --> 01:48:32.540]   I tried three or four.
[01:48:32.540 --> 01:48:33.540]   This is the best one that I saw.
[01:48:33.540 --> 01:48:38.180]   And I did include a couple of mylar bags, which, to be honest, are about 50% effective,
[01:48:38.180 --> 01:48:39.180]   so it's not like it's in effect.
[01:48:39.180 --> 01:48:40.180]   Oh, interesting.
[01:48:40.180 --> 01:48:41.180]   And they're all less expensive.
[01:48:41.180 --> 01:48:44.140]   But again, either you want-- either you want assurance or you don't want assurance,
[01:48:44.140 --> 01:48:46.580]   if you want assurance, it costs you 50 or 60 bucks.
[01:48:46.580 --> 01:48:53.060]   ScooterX in our chat room says that Scott Evess just today announced the blackout pocket.
[01:48:53.060 --> 01:48:56.740]   They're the same idea, a pocket that goes in one of your Scott jackets, and they have
[01:48:56.740 --> 01:48:59.900]   three levels of RFID protection.
[01:48:59.900 --> 01:49:03.460]   I would guess it's the same material.
[01:49:03.460 --> 01:49:10.500]   He says it uses a material called-- proprietary material called RFID Armor.
[01:49:10.500 --> 01:49:12.860]   So it's probably a very similar idea.
[01:49:12.860 --> 01:49:14.900]   And he has the same instructions.
[01:49:14.900 --> 01:49:17.980]   You fold the edge once and then fold it again and secure it on a strip.
[01:49:17.980 --> 01:49:18.980]   Who knows?
[01:49:18.980 --> 01:49:20.980]   Maybe he's even licensing it from these guys.
[01:49:20.980 --> 01:49:21.980]   I don't know.
[01:49:21.980 --> 01:49:22.980]   I'm surprised.
[01:49:22.980 --> 01:49:27.580]   It seemed to make no sense to me that we're trying to borrow radio waves and not trying
[01:49:27.580 --> 01:49:28.580]   to make it waterproof.
[01:49:28.580 --> 01:49:31.860]   But yes, if you actually do leave the top open, that's--
[01:49:31.860 --> 01:49:35.020]   The radio signals can bounce around inside there.
[01:49:35.020 --> 01:49:40.860]   Alex Lindsey, the Liam Neeson of Google Hangouts, that's what If and Done says, "You are."
[01:49:40.860 --> 01:49:42.340]   The Liam--
[01:49:42.340 --> 01:49:44.620]   Very particular set of skills.
[01:49:44.620 --> 01:49:49.420]   Skills that have acquired a very long career.
[01:49:49.420 --> 01:49:51.460]   I want to play that.
[01:49:51.460 --> 01:49:56.620]   Every time Alex is in studio, from now on, now has a new digital business card.
[01:49:56.620 --> 01:49:57.620]   Forget parapetetic.
[01:49:57.620 --> 01:49:58.620]   There you go.
[01:49:58.620 --> 01:50:00.220]   Liam Neeson E. What do you got?
[01:50:00.220 --> 01:50:01.220]   Oh, Lord above.
[01:50:01.220 --> 01:50:02.220]   Don't tell me anything more.
[01:50:02.220 --> 01:50:03.220]   I don't even want to see it.
[01:50:03.220 --> 01:50:05.860]   This is going to cost me money.
[01:50:05.860 --> 01:50:12.380]   So we have a large collection of hardware from a company called Sound Devices.
[01:50:12.380 --> 01:50:13.540]   Oh, yes, you do.
[01:50:13.540 --> 01:50:14.780]   And so do we, thanks to you.
[01:50:14.780 --> 01:50:15.940]   Yes, exactly.
[01:50:15.940 --> 01:50:19.860]   And they released something new that I finally got to put into the field.
[01:50:19.860 --> 01:50:24.180]   And so last time, by the way, when I recommended the United app, it was because this had not
[01:50:24.180 --> 01:50:25.540]   went to my house instead of here.
[01:50:25.540 --> 01:50:28.380]   And I was going to show it because it was like brand new off the--
[01:50:28.380 --> 01:50:31.300]   You know, and I was like, "Ah, what am I going to recommend now?"
[01:50:31.300 --> 01:50:34.500]   So this is the 633.
[01:50:34.500 --> 01:50:39.300]   I have never seen so much-- so many tools packed into such a small little device.
[01:50:39.300 --> 01:50:41.140]   So it's a little portable mixer.
[01:50:41.140 --> 01:50:42.140]   This is a little portable mixer.
[01:50:42.140 --> 01:50:44.940]   Yeah, that would be one way to call it a portable mixer.
[01:50:44.940 --> 01:50:49.740]   Okay, so you've got a-- it's a portable mixer that has-- you have--
[01:50:49.740 --> 01:50:53.860]   You can see John there working on it, one of the guys working on it there.
[01:50:53.860 --> 01:50:55.860]   10 track recording.
[01:50:55.860 --> 01:51:00.580]   So you can do-- so basically, 10 track is you have six tracks in-- is he cutting it in half?
[01:51:00.580 --> 01:51:02.620]   He probably wants to show you what's inside.
[01:51:02.620 --> 01:51:05.100]   That's what I call being serious about that.
[01:51:05.100 --> 01:51:07.500]   He's filling the belt-- No, no, no.
[01:51:07.500 --> 01:51:09.180]   That's a good demonstration that belts off.
[01:51:09.180 --> 01:51:14.940]   So you can have three mic inputs, but you can also have three line inputs.
[01:51:14.940 --> 01:51:18.980]   Then you can mix those to stereo, to auxiliary outs.
[01:51:18.980 --> 01:51:20.580]   You can then reroute all of those.
[01:51:20.580 --> 01:51:22.180]   So this is what's important to us.
[01:51:22.180 --> 01:51:24.300]   Is not only can I record all of those tracks.
[01:51:24.300 --> 01:51:26.100]   So I can record my six tracks coming in.
[01:51:26.100 --> 01:51:28.700]   I can record two auxiliary tracks left and right.
[01:51:28.700 --> 01:51:30.340]   All of those can be routed separately.
[01:51:30.340 --> 01:51:35.340]   So what's going out on the outputs, you know, I can send, you know, tracks two and three
[01:51:35.340 --> 01:51:40.660]   to output, you know, the right to three and four to the left.
[01:51:40.660 --> 01:51:42.580]   Other ones to auxiliary outs.
[01:51:42.580 --> 01:51:46.460]   And for us, you know, being able to have all those-- basically be able to mix minus.
[01:51:46.460 --> 01:51:50.900]   So you're basically able to do multiple mix minuses out of a little field recorder,
[01:51:50.900 --> 01:51:54.220]   as well as record all those tracks, as well as have them fully limited,
[01:51:54.220 --> 01:51:57.820]   as well as being able to do audio delay, which is really important to us,
[01:51:57.820 --> 01:52:03.700]   because when you're doing live audio, being able to get the sync right in the field
[01:52:03.700 --> 01:52:05.380]   becomes a big deal.
[01:52:05.380 --> 01:52:07.380]   Now, this is definitely not for everyone.
[01:52:07.380 --> 01:52:08.740]   It's got a time code generator.
[01:52:08.740 --> 01:52:10.020]   It's got a time code generator.
[01:52:10.020 --> 01:52:13.580]   You can sync this, of course, with a bunch of other devices.
[01:52:13.580 --> 01:52:17.900]   It takes double A, takes batteries in the back, and takes power.
[01:52:17.900 --> 01:52:20.900]   So there's a lot of different ways that you could lose power before you.
[01:52:20.900 --> 01:52:25.940]   I mean, these things are the M1 tanks of, you know, in all other--
[01:52:25.940 --> 01:52:30.700]   as we have 788s and 7220s, you know, and we have 302s and USB 3s.
[01:52:30.700 --> 01:52:33.340]   You were like a grateful dead taper.
[01:52:33.340 --> 01:52:35.900]   This would be like that would be awesome.
[01:52:35.900 --> 01:52:38.580]   This is like, yeah, they're not going to let you in with that.
[01:52:38.580 --> 01:52:42.980]   But the-- and of course it's got these really high quality limiters
[01:52:42.980 --> 01:52:45.380]   so that you're not peaking.
[01:52:45.380 --> 01:52:47.580]   I have no need for this, and I want it so bad.
[01:52:47.580 --> 01:52:48.180]   Oh, my gosh.
[01:52:48.180 --> 01:52:54.380]   It is-- it is a-- it is a-- it is a-- it records to SD or CompactFlash.
[01:52:54.380 --> 01:52:56.180]   You can, of course, hook it to your computer.
[01:52:56.180 --> 01:53:00.460]   That the, you know, there's just an enormous number of options
[01:53:00.460 --> 01:53:02.180]   that are possible here.
[01:53:02.180 --> 01:53:08.020]   So it is-- and of course, you know, you can record to SD or CompactFlash
[01:53:08.020 --> 01:53:10.300]   order both at the same time, which means that you can, you know,
[01:53:10.300 --> 01:53:11.340]   have a backup immediately.
[01:53:11.340 --> 01:53:12.460]   You can hand it off to your client.
[01:53:12.460 --> 01:53:14.460]   So you can be recording your own, and then you're recording it
[01:53:14.460 --> 01:53:16.620]   to an SD card, and then you can just hand one of them
[01:53:16.620 --> 01:53:18.180]   to your client, and you're done.
[01:53:18.180 --> 01:53:22.100]   And I think that these are-- I think that the price is $3,200.
[01:53:22.100 --> 01:53:23.100]   Oh!
[01:53:23.100 --> 01:53:25.060]   So it causes my just a computer.
[01:53:25.060 --> 01:53:26.060]   Oh.
[01:53:26.060 --> 01:53:28.820]   But you have to-- here's the deal is that for the handful of you
[01:53:28.820 --> 01:53:34.060]   listening to this show that really need high quality feel recording,
[01:53:34.060 --> 01:53:37.140]   the way-- you know, this is-- you know, every once in a while,
[01:53:37.140 --> 01:53:37.860]   I've been pretty good.
[01:53:37.860 --> 01:53:39.900]   I've been doing lots of inexpensive ones.
[01:53:39.900 --> 01:53:41.220]   My last couple have been free.
[01:53:41.220 --> 01:53:42.460]   I had to make up for it, you know?
[01:53:42.460 --> 01:53:43.140]   So this is--
[01:53:43.140 --> 01:53:44.020]   Can I tell you devil's advocate?
[01:53:44.020 --> 01:53:47.100]   Would your client be more pleased if you recorded it on an iPad mini
[01:53:47.100 --> 01:53:49.860]   and then gave them the iPad mini afterward?
[01:53:49.860 --> 01:53:51.420]   It'd be cheaper.
[01:53:51.420 --> 01:53:54.100]   You know, but the quality would not be nearly as high.
[01:53:54.100 --> 01:53:57.700]   You know, so the-- I mean, the main thing is that if you're doing live,
[01:53:57.700 --> 01:54:01.660]   especially if you're doing a live event and you're recording the audio,
[01:54:01.660 --> 01:54:04.340]   which is what we were doing with it yesterday,
[01:54:04.340 --> 01:54:07.860]   it is being able to-- I mean, this is really--
[01:54:07.860 --> 01:54:09.020]   I mean, and this is the standard.
[01:54:09.020 --> 01:54:11.020]   I mean, everybody's using sound devices in the field.
[01:54:11.020 --> 01:54:12.020]   So you end up--
[01:54:12.020 --> 01:54:14.420]   You went to see Dexter, you know, your buddy.
[01:54:14.420 --> 01:54:17.900]   That's what the guy was recording audio tracks for the TV show.
[01:54:17.900 --> 01:54:18.900]   And it's pretty much everyone, right?
[01:54:18.900 --> 01:54:22.700]   I mean, for film and TV, you know, this is kind of the standard.
[01:54:22.700 --> 01:54:26.660]   And so-- and again, being able-- for those of you doing live audio,
[01:54:26.660 --> 01:54:30.700]   being able to do mixed minus with delay, you know, to sync up your audio
[01:54:30.700 --> 01:54:35.220]   is something that is very, very hard to find in a little package that small.
[01:54:35.220 --> 01:54:40.620]   So anyway, this has become my-- we got one, but I think this one's not going
[01:54:40.620 --> 01:54:41.940]   to go much further than my house.
[01:54:41.940 --> 01:54:43.980]   So this is the one that goes out with me.
[01:54:43.980 --> 01:54:49.100]   Just in time for the radio industry to die, the perfect field recorder for radio
[01:54:49.100 --> 01:54:50.100]   and recording.
[01:54:50.100 --> 01:54:51.100]   Well, but we don't use it for radio.
[01:54:51.100 --> 01:54:52.100]   We use it for--
[01:54:52.100 --> 01:54:53.100]   But you could.
[01:54:53.100 --> 01:54:54.100]   You could.
[01:54:54.100 --> 01:54:55.100]   But I mean, this would be incredible for radio.
[01:54:55.100 --> 01:54:57.100]   But what it's really good for is if you're doing a video recording,
[01:54:57.100 --> 01:54:59.900]   you have three people on my x, you can be bringing in other audio via line inputs,
[01:54:59.900 --> 01:55:04.300]   you can be-- you know, individually delaying all-- or delaying the outputs
[01:55:04.300 --> 01:55:05.780]   so that you can make that work.
[01:55:05.780 --> 01:55:10.780]   It's an incredible amount of power.
[01:55:10.780 --> 01:55:13.380]   And you can safely cut it in half.
[01:55:13.380 --> 01:55:15.780]   There's like six people out there that just went, "Oh my gosh, my life is changed."
[01:55:15.780 --> 01:55:17.780]   It's only five Alex's.
[01:55:17.780 --> 01:55:18.780]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:55:18.780 --> 01:55:20.980]   You know, so yeah.
[01:55:20.980 --> 01:55:23.980]   Definitely like open the box before you leave the store to make sure you didn't get
[01:55:23.980 --> 01:55:25.780]   the one that they cut in half.
[01:55:25.780 --> 01:55:26.780]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:55:26.780 --> 01:55:29.060]   Just take it if it rattles.
[01:55:29.060 --> 01:55:30.060]   You know what?
[01:55:30.060 --> 01:55:35.300]   And for us, you know, what we were using before this was the 788, which is twice as much,
[01:55:35.300 --> 01:55:36.300]   which we have a bunch of too.
[01:55:36.300 --> 01:55:38.340]   Oh, you didn't say that.
[01:55:38.340 --> 01:55:40.300]   This is half the cost of the 788.
[01:55:40.300 --> 01:55:41.300]   Exactly.
[01:55:41.300 --> 01:55:42.300]   Oh, well then.
[01:55:42.300 --> 01:55:43.300]   Give me two.
[01:55:43.300 --> 01:55:44.300]   Exactly.
[01:55:44.300 --> 01:55:46.300]   So, but it only has three mic inputs.
[01:55:46.300 --> 01:55:47.300]   Yes.
[01:55:47.300 --> 01:55:49.300]   So you can do like a round table show with it.
[01:55:49.300 --> 01:55:50.980]   You couldn't do a round table unless you converted it.
[01:55:50.980 --> 01:55:52.420]   You have three line inputs.
[01:55:52.420 --> 01:55:55.300]   So if you had-- if you used MM1s, you could do six people.
[01:55:55.300 --> 01:55:56.300]   So if you had a couple--
[01:55:56.300 --> 01:55:59.500]   Why does it have 10 track recording if there's only?
[01:55:59.500 --> 01:56:03.220]   It's six inputs, plus left and right, plus auxiliary one and two.
[01:56:03.220 --> 01:56:05.540]   So it's 10 tracks that you can record to.
[01:56:05.540 --> 01:56:10.820]   So it's-- but if you had little portable units that we used, the AMP microphones, you
[01:56:10.820 --> 01:56:12.420]   could totally put six people in there.
[01:56:12.420 --> 01:56:15.580]   There are people in the chat room who are saying, "That is an amazing bargain."
[01:56:15.580 --> 01:56:16.580]   It is.
[01:56:16.580 --> 01:56:18.380]   Those are the people who should buy this.
[01:56:18.380 --> 01:56:19.380]   Yes.
[01:56:19.380 --> 01:56:20.380]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:56:20.380 --> 01:56:23.340]   If you say, "That's an amazing bargain, it's for you."
[01:56:23.340 --> 01:56:28.020]   I always love the contrast between like someone like me and someone like Alex.
[01:56:28.020 --> 01:56:30.100]   I thought it was a big deal that I said, "You know what?
[01:56:30.100 --> 01:56:31.340]   I do a lot of field recording now.
[01:56:31.340 --> 01:56:36.540]   I should spend $60 on a portable recorder now."
[01:56:36.540 --> 01:56:37.540]   So I have that.
[01:56:37.540 --> 01:56:41.580]   And then-- which is perfectly adequate for an idiot, but for if you want to actually
[01:56:41.580 --> 01:56:43.100]   be the Liam Neeson of mobile--
[01:56:43.100 --> 01:56:45.340]   Well, the problem is if you're--
[01:56:45.340 --> 01:56:51.660]   with the shows that we work on, if the audio is scratchy or peaked or doesn't work, or
[01:56:51.660 --> 01:56:55.460]   we don't have recordings or whatever, it's a pretty--
[01:56:55.460 --> 01:56:56.940]   Let's put it that way.
[01:56:56.940 --> 01:56:59.620]   For us, the most expensive thing is failure.
[01:56:59.620 --> 01:57:02.420]   Your reputation is worth a lot more than $3, $200.
[01:57:02.420 --> 01:57:05.460]   Can I make that my motto to most expensive thing?
[01:57:05.460 --> 01:57:07.460]   Oh, yeah.
[01:57:07.460 --> 01:57:11.100]   Mr. Chris Breen, your pick of the week, sir.
[01:57:11.100 --> 01:57:15.780]   It's that time of year when birds are moving around and they're moving from place to place,
[01:57:15.780 --> 01:57:18.340]   they're going from north to south and south to north.
[01:57:18.340 --> 01:57:24.060]   And I'm a bird watcher when I'm not hanging around looking into a bad camcorder.
[01:57:24.060 --> 01:57:30.300]   So what I do instead is I go outside with my binoculars and I identify birds.
[01:57:30.300 --> 01:57:34.380]   And this is an app that's been about-- it's been out for quite some time, but I picked
[01:57:34.380 --> 01:57:37.940]   it up thinking, you know, I'm using this again because it's that time of year.
[01:57:37.940 --> 01:57:39.260]   And it's actually by Audubon.
[01:57:39.260 --> 01:57:40.940]   It's called Audubon Birds Pro.
[01:57:40.940 --> 01:57:42.900]   Oh, I saw this at Macworld last year.
[01:57:42.900 --> 01:57:44.380]   This is beautiful.
[01:57:44.380 --> 01:57:47.020]   Yeah, it's only $15.
[01:57:47.020 --> 01:57:51.380]   I mean, for people who spend $0.99 on apps and think that's too much, they may say, "Well,
[01:57:51.380 --> 01:57:53.340]   that's obscene."
[01:57:53.340 --> 01:57:57.300]   One of the nice things about this, that it works for the E-Bird service.
[01:57:57.300 --> 01:58:02.540]   And what that is, it's a database service basically that is kind of a social networking
[01:58:02.540 --> 01:58:07.100]   thing so that when you're in the field and you spot a bird that looks interesting or unusual
[01:58:07.100 --> 01:58:11.140]   to you or you add it to your life list, you can send this up to E-Bird and that becomes
[01:58:11.140 --> 01:58:16.540]   immediately available to everybody else who wishes to see what's operating in that particular
[01:58:16.540 --> 01:58:17.540]   area.
[01:58:17.540 --> 01:58:22.980]   So right now, where I live, there's a couple of bald eagles that are nearby.
[01:58:22.980 --> 01:58:25.220]   And this is very rare for us.
[01:58:25.220 --> 01:58:30.100]   So if I want to see what's in the neighborhood that's rare and unusual, I just tap on check
[01:58:30.100 --> 01:58:31.100]   local birds.
[01:58:31.100 --> 01:58:34.300]   It will show me what people have spotted recently, but it will also show you rare bird
[01:58:34.300 --> 01:58:35.300]   findings.
[01:58:35.300 --> 01:58:36.980]   So it's a terrific application.
[01:58:36.980 --> 01:58:40.340]   You can put them both your phone or you can put on your iPad.
[01:58:40.340 --> 01:58:42.140]   It's one of my favorite bird apps.
[01:58:42.140 --> 01:58:46.220]   I like about three or four of them, but that's the one I use when I particularly want to spot
[01:58:46.220 --> 01:58:49.940]   something, mark it so other people can see it and then look at other people's marks and
[01:58:49.940 --> 01:58:52.300]   then travel to see a rare bird.
[01:58:52.300 --> 01:58:53.300]   I'm listening.
[01:58:53.300 --> 01:58:54.860]   I didn't know you were a birder.
[01:58:54.860 --> 01:58:56.340]   I'm a pretty bad birder.
[01:58:56.340 --> 01:59:00.620]   We have this hawk that's been out in the backyard for the last week and I said, "Oh,
[01:59:00.620 --> 01:59:01.780]   it's a sharp shined hawk."
[01:59:01.780 --> 01:59:06.300]   And I took a picture of it and posted and said, "No, you idiots, a Cooper's hawk."
[01:59:06.300 --> 01:59:10.940]   Because of course, everybody knows Cooper's hawk has a single white band around the neck
[01:59:10.940 --> 01:59:12.740]   and one of them.
[01:59:12.740 --> 01:59:13.740]   Yeah.
[01:59:13.740 --> 01:59:14.740]   Yeah.
[01:59:14.740 --> 01:59:15.740]   Yeah.
[01:59:15.740 --> 01:59:18.780]   If you think the tech people are picky-bikes, you talk to birders who go, "Now, you know,
[01:59:18.780 --> 01:59:21.700]   the leg on the sharpshine, it's called the sharpshine hawk.
[01:59:21.700 --> 01:59:23.700]   You idiot because the shins are pshin.
[01:59:23.700 --> 01:59:28.940]   It's got a sharp shin and apparently it's about the size of a pencil versus your little
[01:59:28.940 --> 01:59:30.940]   finger."
[01:59:30.940 --> 01:59:33.700]   So yeah, if you want to be humiliated, become a birder.
[01:59:33.700 --> 01:59:34.700]   It's a cockatile.
[01:59:34.700 --> 01:59:38.060]   It's a sparrow you idiot.
[01:59:38.060 --> 01:59:45.900]   Now you need the 633 to record the bird song and upload it to your E-Bird catalog.
[01:59:45.900 --> 01:59:47.380]   Wow.
[01:59:47.380 --> 01:59:50.340]   Birding has really gotten high tech.
[01:59:50.340 --> 01:59:51.340]   It has in a way.
[01:59:51.340 --> 01:59:54.980]   You know what they really need though is something like that audio device that will
[01:59:54.980 --> 02:00:00.460]   be able to pick out the bird call that I want to hear and then identify it for me because
[02:00:00.460 --> 02:00:03.660]   that technology apparently exists but not in mobile apps.
[02:00:03.660 --> 02:00:09.180]   So developers out there find a way to sample bird sounds and help me identify the bird.
[02:00:09.180 --> 02:00:10.180]   Wouldn't that be cool?
[02:00:10.180 --> 02:00:12.340]   I'd be can you write to its nest?
[02:00:12.340 --> 02:00:20.180]   We have a new, thanks to F&D on a new Photoshop mean, the most expensive thing in failure.
[02:00:20.180 --> 02:00:24.180]   I find your lack of bit rate disappointed.
[02:00:24.180 --> 02:00:27.180]   I want that.
[02:00:27.180 --> 02:00:33.260]   Alright Renee Richie, we got a $3,000 recorder.
[02:00:33.260 --> 02:00:35.860]   We got a $15 birding app.
[02:00:35.860 --> 02:00:39.140]   We got a $60 bag.
[02:00:39.140 --> 02:00:42.020]   RF, invisible bag.
[02:00:42.020 --> 02:00:45.100]   What could possibly do to top that?
[02:00:45.100 --> 02:00:48.580]   So I thought I had an expensive pick and I was going to be all apologetic about it but
[02:00:48.580 --> 02:00:51.420]   now after Alex, I just don't care anymore.
[02:00:51.420 --> 02:00:57.220]   So this is about $100 and this is a Moga and what this does is it takes a game like we
[02:00:57.220 --> 02:01:02.660]   have these iOS games that have these virtual joysticks on them and they work well enough
[02:01:02.660 --> 02:01:09.340]   but a lot of people are used to Nintendo devices or Sony devices that have actual physical buttons
[02:01:09.340 --> 02:01:11.220]   even an Xbox controller.
[02:01:11.220 --> 02:01:14.860]   So what the Moga does is it comes in this little package and it's about $100 and you
[02:01:14.860 --> 02:01:16.380]   open it out.
[02:01:16.380 --> 02:01:18.260]   And then you've got a lightning connector in it.
[02:01:18.260 --> 02:01:19.780]   It's got a battery pack in it.
[02:01:19.780 --> 02:01:23.620]   You can charge it and you just place your iPhone inside.
[02:01:23.620 --> 02:01:28.340]   You close it back up again and suddenly you have a full on game controller.
[02:01:28.340 --> 02:01:31.500]   So instead of putting it on timeout like in one of Andy's bags, you can actually let
[02:01:31.500 --> 02:01:34.100]   your iPhone out for some fun.
[02:01:34.100 --> 02:01:36.100]   It's got two analog joysticks.
[02:01:36.100 --> 02:01:37.940]   It's got the D-pad on it.
[02:01:37.940 --> 02:01:39.260]   I'm back to four words here.
[02:01:39.260 --> 02:01:40.900]   It's got buttons on it.
[02:01:40.900 --> 02:01:43.820]   Anything any gamer will be intimately familiar with.
[02:01:43.820 --> 02:01:47.100]   It works with any iOS 7 device.
[02:01:47.100 --> 02:01:51.620]   Something else that was announced at WWDC was this MFI program made for iPhone where
[02:01:51.620 --> 02:01:53.980]   they have a standard for these controllers now.
[02:01:53.980 --> 02:01:54.980]   Logitech makes them.
[02:01:54.980 --> 02:01:57.700]   There's a variety of people who are making them.
[02:01:57.700 --> 02:02:01.740]   And this one, I got it at the Apple Store, arrived there a couple days ago.
[02:02:01.740 --> 02:02:03.620]   You can get them from a lot of sources now.
[02:02:03.620 --> 02:02:07.540]   And it's just if you are a tactile gamer, if you have always had a controller in your
[02:02:07.540 --> 02:02:13.380]   hand and you always want a controller in your hand, this will work with any modern iPhone,
[02:02:13.380 --> 02:02:16.060]   the current generation iPod touch.
[02:02:16.060 --> 02:02:19.660]   And it just makes gaming a little bit more traditional, more retro.
[02:02:19.660 --> 02:02:23.740]   My issue with these was always that you had to have special games.
[02:02:23.740 --> 02:02:28.220]   But now that there's a standard, there are a lot of games supporting something like this.
[02:02:28.220 --> 02:02:31.220]   Yeah, you can go to their website and they'll actually show you the latest games that are
[02:02:31.220 --> 02:02:32.700]   supporting the MFI program.
[02:02:32.700 --> 02:02:36.540]   And I'm using King of the Fighters, which isn't the most recent game, but more and more
[02:02:36.540 --> 02:02:37.540]   adding.
[02:02:37.540 --> 02:02:38.540]   They do have to add support for it.
[02:02:38.540 --> 02:02:43.100]   Like you have to add support for Bluetooth, keyboard or any other protocol that comes out.
[02:02:43.100 --> 02:02:45.900]   But again, more, it's not appropriate for every kind of game.
[02:02:45.900 --> 02:02:48.260]   Like I wouldn't use this for letter press.
[02:02:48.260 --> 02:02:49.260]   No.
[02:02:49.260 --> 02:02:52.500]   I can lay those tabs down so fast.
[02:02:52.500 --> 02:02:53.500]   Absolutely.
[02:02:53.500 --> 02:02:58.020]   But for games that are trying to adapt from being controller based games and have the virtual
[02:02:58.020 --> 02:03:01.300]   controller, the tactile controller in many ways is still superior.
[02:03:01.300 --> 02:03:03.900]   You have to have it for Call of Duty Strike team.
[02:03:03.900 --> 02:03:06.180]   There's no choice.
[02:03:06.180 --> 02:03:10.260]   If you're going out, if you're clearing somebody's skies, Leo, you want to do it with hardware
[02:03:10.260 --> 02:03:11.260]   buttons.
[02:03:11.260 --> 02:03:18.500]   Hey, mine is kind of cute little doohickey that turns your iPad into an iMac.
[02:03:18.500 --> 02:03:19.500]   Look at that.
[02:03:19.500 --> 02:03:21.500]   It looks just like an iMac.
[02:03:21.500 --> 02:03:23.500]   It's like a little tiny iMac.
[02:03:23.500 --> 02:03:24.500]   It's like a little baby iMac.
[02:03:24.500 --> 02:03:26.700]   And I fell in love with these sight unseen.
[02:03:26.700 --> 02:03:28.740]   I went out and bought two.
[02:03:28.740 --> 02:03:30.340]   One for my iPad.
[02:03:30.340 --> 02:03:35.140]   This is the full size one and one for my iPad mini.
[02:03:35.140 --> 02:03:37.940]   This has some sort of nano suction material on it.
[02:03:37.940 --> 02:03:41.100]   In fact, it comes, it's protected by a plastic shield.
[02:03:41.100 --> 02:03:45.780]   They say keep that so that if you're going to transport it or whatever, you keep that
[02:03:45.780 --> 02:03:46.780]   thing clean.
[02:03:46.780 --> 02:03:52.460]   This is removable, but once it's on there, it's really on there using micro suction.
[02:03:52.460 --> 02:03:53.460]   I want to see.
[02:03:53.460 --> 02:03:54.460]   You want to see?
[02:03:54.460 --> 02:03:55.460]   Here, play with it.
[02:03:55.460 --> 02:03:56.460]   Isn't that cool?
[02:03:56.460 --> 02:03:58.700]   Now, you can't adjust the angle or anything like that.
[02:03:58.700 --> 02:04:00.180]   It's a cast aluminum.
[02:04:00.180 --> 02:04:01.620]   It really does look like an iMac.
[02:04:01.620 --> 02:04:03.780]   Yeah, it's on there good, but you can get it off.
[02:04:03.780 --> 02:04:05.020]   You just rip it off?
[02:04:05.020 --> 02:04:06.020]   Yeah.
[02:04:06.020 --> 02:04:07.020]   Just pull it off.
[02:04:07.020 --> 02:04:07.860]   Yeah.
[02:04:07.860 --> 02:04:11.820]   When it comes and you don't have to do anything special to put it back on, they do say keep
[02:04:11.820 --> 02:04:12.820]   it clean.
[02:04:12.820 --> 02:04:16.380]   Don't let Alex put his face on it.
[02:04:16.380 --> 02:04:21.020]   They also say be careful about washing it because you can remove it.
[02:04:21.020 --> 02:04:24.460]   It's not good for high temperature.
[02:04:24.460 --> 02:04:26.660]   This is a really cool little device.
[02:04:26.660 --> 02:04:28.500]   It's called the Slope.
[02:04:28.500 --> 02:04:31.380]   It's from a company called Deci, D-E-K-E.
[02:04:31.380 --> 02:04:37.180]   When I like about it, even though the angle is not adjustable, it's sturdy enough because
[02:04:37.180 --> 02:04:43.740]   it's got suction on the top and the bottom that you could use it and kind of knock, bang
[02:04:43.740 --> 02:04:44.740]   on it.
[02:04:44.740 --> 02:04:45.740]   Touch the keys and do all that stuff.
[02:04:45.740 --> 02:04:48.660]   You can see this guy's really using it.
[02:04:48.660 --> 02:04:53.300]   It can almost make a permanent kiosk like installation for your--
[02:04:53.300 --> 02:04:54.900]   That's a great icon, isn't it?
[02:04:54.900 --> 02:04:56.820]   Well, it's a little pricey.
[02:04:56.820 --> 02:04:57.820]   That's kind of the negative.
[02:04:57.820 --> 02:04:58.820]   There are two sizes.
[02:04:58.820 --> 02:05:00.340]   There's the mini and the Slope 10.
[02:05:00.340 --> 02:05:02.260]   The one you're looking at is for the 10 inch.
[02:05:02.260 --> 02:05:04.660]   By the way, it's not specifically for an iPad.
[02:05:04.660 --> 02:05:08.300]   48 bucks because they're having a holiday sale right now, normally $60.
[02:05:08.300 --> 02:05:11.460]   Actually, that's a pretty-- 48 bucks is pretty good.
[02:05:11.460 --> 02:05:14.580]   You think the adhesive would stand up to taking it on and off like when you get into
[02:05:14.580 --> 02:05:16.700]   the office, when you leave the office, when you get into the office?
[02:05:16.700 --> 02:05:17.700]   Yeah, I think so.
[02:05:17.700 --> 02:05:20.780]   It's one of them space age, like--
[02:05:20.780 --> 02:05:21.780]   Palimers.
[02:05:21.780 --> 02:05:22.780]   Palimers.
[02:05:22.780 --> 02:05:24.420]   I don't know what it is.
[02:05:24.420 --> 02:05:29.620]   They say it's a nano-- they call it nano suction.
[02:05:29.620 --> 02:05:30.620]   Nano foam.
[02:05:30.620 --> 02:05:34.300]   They're giving those out for the elevation dock now so you can finally take your iPhone
[02:05:34.300 --> 02:05:36.500]   out of them again without picking the whole dock up.
[02:05:36.500 --> 02:05:37.900]   Ah, all right.
[02:05:37.900 --> 02:05:39.460]   My experience I've removed it a few times.
[02:05:39.460 --> 02:05:41.660]   I'm not sure I'd want to do it every day.
[02:05:41.660 --> 02:05:46.140]   And of course, if you have a case, you can't-- you have to take off the case.
[02:05:46.140 --> 02:05:47.740]   But it also doesn't have to be an iPad.
[02:05:47.740 --> 02:05:52.100]   Anything with a kind of non-porous surface in the back of it would work fine.
[02:05:52.100 --> 02:05:53.460]   It's a little big-- the little one is too big.
[02:05:53.460 --> 02:05:54.460]   We tried it with the iPhone 5.
[02:05:54.460 --> 02:05:55.460]   It's a little too big for the iPhone 5.
[02:05:55.460 --> 02:05:56.460]   It overlaps.
[02:05:56.460 --> 02:05:58.380]   I mean, you could use it and just overlaps.
[02:05:58.380 --> 02:05:59.860]   But it really is beautiful.
[02:05:59.860 --> 02:06:05.300]   I think when you do it on a 10-inch iPad, I mean, it just really makes it look like a
[02:06:05.300 --> 02:06:07.940]   little mini baby iMac.
[02:06:07.940 --> 02:06:08.940]   So cute.
[02:06:08.940 --> 02:06:11.340]   48 bucks for right now on sale.
[02:06:11.340 --> 02:06:17.220]   D-E-K-K-E, Dec-E dot net.
[02:06:17.220 --> 02:06:18.740]   Wow, what a fun show this was, gentlemen.
[02:06:18.740 --> 02:06:19.940]   Didn't you thought there'd be no notes?
[02:06:19.940 --> 02:06:21.300]   Absolutely nothing to talk about.
[02:06:21.300 --> 02:06:22.460]   We found something.
[02:06:22.460 --> 02:06:24.220]   We generated some excitement.
[02:06:24.220 --> 02:06:30.660]   The Body of Brin can be seen at macworld.com and on Twitter @bodyofbrin.
[02:06:30.660 --> 02:06:33.340]   And are you performing for the holidays anywhere in the Bay Area?
[02:06:33.340 --> 02:06:35.460]   We can all run out and see you.
[02:06:35.460 --> 02:06:40.420]   I haven't-- I did a while ago and there doesn't seem to be anything on the books.
[02:06:40.420 --> 02:06:45.380]   I am, of course, providing music for all my friends for holidays.
[02:06:45.380 --> 02:06:49.500]   If you want to read my feelings about holiday music, you can go to chrisbrin.com where I
[02:06:49.500 --> 02:06:53.460]   tell you exactly how much musicians hate holiday music.
[02:06:53.460 --> 02:06:59.420]   It does seem-- of course, I put on the Pandora or Songs, which is another good choice-- holiday
[02:06:59.420 --> 02:07:00.420]   channels.
[02:07:00.420 --> 02:07:05.460]   And it does seem like a lot of very, very famous stars just really phoned in for their
[02:07:05.460 --> 02:07:06.460]   Christmas albums.
[02:07:06.460 --> 02:07:07.460]   Well, it's, you know, it's like--
[02:07:07.460 --> 02:07:08.460]   You know, it's like--
[02:07:08.460 --> 02:07:09.460]   It was a-- yeah.
[02:07:09.460 --> 02:07:14.340]   There was a-- I was listening to a soul soul Christmas song that basically had one note.
[02:07:14.340 --> 02:07:20.820]   It was like, you know, it's like 3 a.m.
[02:07:20.820 --> 02:07:24.740]   They'd recorded the album and they said, all right, guys, let's do one more for the holidays.
[02:07:24.740 --> 02:07:26.660]   Like, do we have to?
[02:07:26.660 --> 02:07:28.660]   We'll pay you $1 million.
[02:07:28.660 --> 02:07:29.660]   Okay.
[02:07:29.660 --> 02:07:30.660]   No, think of it as annuity.
[02:07:30.660 --> 02:07:32.820]   I mean, it's experiencinging so much easier.
[02:07:32.820 --> 02:07:37.340]   It's an annuity because when you make a Christmas song, it comes back every year.
[02:07:37.340 --> 02:07:40.780]   So I think that they do it because they know they're going to--
[02:07:40.780 --> 02:07:43.100]   It's kind of like a seasonal recurrent on steroids.
[02:07:43.100 --> 02:07:44.100]   Pastaros.
[02:07:44.100 --> 02:07:48.100]   Well, it's the kind-- it's-- you know, when you become an artist, it's a contractually mandated
[02:07:48.100 --> 02:07:49.100]   like--
[02:07:49.100 --> 02:07:50.100]   Is it?
[02:07:50.100 --> 02:07:51.100]   Oh, yeah, like do wedding with Willie Nelson.
[02:07:51.100 --> 02:07:53.340]   You have to do it in your career.
[02:07:53.340 --> 02:07:55.660]   Otherwise, they throw you out of the union.
[02:07:55.660 --> 02:07:58.820]   As long as I don't have to do it with that Tom Jones guy because he grabs my ass every
[02:07:58.820 --> 02:07:59.820]   single time.
[02:07:59.820 --> 02:08:00.820]   Every time.
[02:08:00.820 --> 02:08:01.820]   And I just-- every single time.
[02:08:01.820 --> 02:08:03.620]   Well, that's so nice to have you, Chris.
[02:08:03.620 --> 02:08:07.260]   And whatever you do, don't play any holiday music, okay?
[02:08:07.260 --> 02:08:09.780]   Leave that to the professionals.
[02:08:09.780 --> 02:08:10.780]   I will thank you.
[02:08:10.780 --> 02:08:13.100]   The manheim steam rollers of the world.
[02:08:13.100 --> 02:08:14.100]   George Winston.
[02:08:14.100 --> 02:08:15.100]   George Winston.
[02:08:15.100 --> 02:08:17.100]   He's got the franchise.
[02:08:17.100 --> 02:08:23.260]   Andy Inaco, what will the holidays bring for you besides snow to the Boston area?
[02:08:23.260 --> 02:08:25.300]   Peace on Earth, Goodwill Towards Men.
[02:08:25.300 --> 02:08:30.020]   Part one of my gift guide ran in the Sun times yesterday, Part Two runs tomorrow.
[02:08:30.020 --> 02:08:35.900]   And if you head over to anathco.com, I'm doing my annual musical advent calendar where
[02:08:35.900 --> 02:08:42.420]   more or less once a day I post about a stupidly long essay about a certain favorite-- a different
[02:08:42.420 --> 02:08:44.260]   favorite song of mine.
[02:08:44.260 --> 02:08:48.860]   And not one of mine that I actually recorded, one that I've actually purchased for 99 cents
[02:08:48.860 --> 02:08:49.860]   or so.
[02:08:49.860 --> 02:08:50.860]   Sounds good.
[02:08:50.860 --> 02:08:52.860]   I started off this year with Sondheim Week, so there's a lot of--
[02:08:52.860 --> 02:08:53.860]   Ooh.
[02:08:53.860 --> 02:08:54.860]   --really, real pretentious.
[02:08:54.860 --> 02:08:59.500]   Like, people have to understand about companies that it's not anti-marriage.
[02:08:59.500 --> 02:09:00.500]   It's very pro-marriage.
[02:09:00.500 --> 02:09:05.500]   As we see the-- now, people don't understand that Bobby wasn't actually at the party at
[02:09:05.500 --> 02:09:06.500]   all.
[02:09:06.500 --> 02:09:07.500]   Now, if you understand--
[02:09:07.500 --> 02:09:08.500]   Bobby.
[02:09:08.500 --> 02:09:09.500]   Bobby.
[02:09:09.500 --> 02:09:10.500]   Bobby.
[02:09:10.500 --> 02:09:11.500]   Bobby.
[02:09:11.500 --> 02:09:12.500]   Bobby.
[02:09:12.500 --> 02:09:13.500]   Bobby.
[02:09:13.500 --> 02:09:18.260]   Bobby and I really kind of like musicals too much.
[02:09:18.260 --> 02:09:21.140]   You can't love Sondheim too much.
[02:09:21.140 --> 02:09:22.140]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:09:22.140 --> 02:09:27.020]   The most specific overtures that you haven't heard in eight months and now-- OK, great.
[02:09:27.020 --> 02:09:28.460]   Now, it's Pacific Overtures Week.
[02:09:28.460 --> 02:09:29.460]   I agree.
[02:09:29.460 --> 02:09:31.820]   Is this-- can you turn up my audio?
[02:09:31.820 --> 02:09:32.820]   Is this the salsa?
[02:09:32.820 --> 02:09:33.820]   Is it not playing--
[02:09:33.820 --> 02:09:35.620]   It's not playing-- oh, shoot.
[02:09:35.620 --> 02:09:37.700]   There's something I need to push some button.
[02:09:37.700 --> 02:09:43.220]   Maybe Google Music knows I want to play it and violate every copyright law known to
[02:09:43.220 --> 02:09:44.220]   man.
[02:09:44.220 --> 02:09:45.220]   Oh, well.
[02:09:45.220 --> 02:09:47.020]   Google Music sometimes does that.
[02:09:47.020 --> 02:09:48.020]   Like, you can look.
[02:09:48.020 --> 02:09:49.580]   It's not making any progress down there.
[02:09:49.580 --> 02:09:50.580]   Yeah.
[02:09:50.580 --> 02:09:51.580]   Progress bar.
[02:09:51.580 --> 02:09:52.580]   Oh, is that it?
[02:09:52.580 --> 02:09:53.580]   It's just playing?
[02:09:53.580 --> 02:09:54.580]   It's just playing.
[02:09:54.580 --> 02:09:55.580]   But it's in a blackout bag.
[02:09:55.580 --> 02:09:56.580]   Yeah.
[02:09:56.580 --> 02:09:57.580]   It thinks it's playing.
[02:09:57.580 --> 02:10:00.500]   I beacon could see the maliciousness in your soul and intercept it before you could actually
[02:10:00.500 --> 02:10:01.500]   enact.
[02:10:01.500 --> 02:10:02.500]   Hey.
[02:10:02.500 --> 02:10:03.500]   Aw, you know.
[02:10:03.500 --> 02:10:04.980]   It's a minority report.
[02:10:04.980 --> 02:10:08.780]   I'm not going to do it.
[02:10:08.780 --> 02:10:10.980]   That's showing amazing restraint, Mr. Renee Ritchie.
[02:10:10.980 --> 02:10:11.980]   I'm more.com.
[02:10:11.980 --> 02:10:14.380]   We thank you for being here as well for the holidays.
[02:10:14.380 --> 02:10:15.380]   You're welcome.
[02:10:15.380 --> 02:10:20.380]   And, of course, Mr. Alex Lindsey, who may be here next week or may be in Delhi.
[02:10:20.380 --> 02:10:21.380]   One never knows.
[02:10:21.380 --> 02:10:23.180]   Or maybe back quite from Delhi by then.
[02:10:23.180 --> 02:10:24.180]   Actually be back.
[02:10:24.180 --> 02:10:25.180]   No, no, no, no.
[02:10:25.180 --> 02:10:26.180]   I'll let you know.
[02:10:26.180 --> 02:10:27.180]   I'll post a week.
[02:10:27.180 --> 02:10:31.540]   I know you can't confirm, but I don't think you'll be eliminated in the first week.
[02:10:31.540 --> 02:10:37.460]   Just read the clue carefully and remember anything with a yellow and red flag on it is potentially
[02:10:37.460 --> 02:10:38.620]   a clue to the clue box.
[02:10:38.620 --> 02:10:40.380]   Don't just run past it.
[02:10:40.380 --> 02:10:47.740]   And, by the way, you know, I really like that your choice of artwork, Andy, it was a very
[02:10:47.740 --> 02:10:48.980]   fair humor, yes.
[02:10:48.980 --> 02:10:51.140]   A little Smith's instrumental.
[02:10:51.140 --> 02:10:56.780]   Please, you know, you layer something like that HBO had this great song kind of documentary
[02:10:56.780 --> 02:10:57.780]   last night.
[02:10:57.780 --> 02:11:00.780]   And so I've been listening to George like all day.
[02:11:00.780 --> 02:11:01.780]   That's right.
[02:11:01.780 --> 02:11:02.780]   Send in the park with George.
[02:11:02.780 --> 02:11:03.780]   I forgot.
[02:11:03.780 --> 02:11:05.380]   There was a sign on connection.
[02:11:05.380 --> 02:11:08.700]   Every time I see the painting, all I think of is the instrumental version of the Smith's.
[02:11:08.700 --> 02:11:10.700]   Please, please let me get what I want.
[02:11:10.700 --> 02:11:13.900]   It's you know, the most expensive thing is failure.
[02:11:13.900 --> 02:11:14.900]   I just really go.
[02:11:14.900 --> 02:11:17.900]   Thank you all for being here.
[02:11:17.900 --> 02:11:22.140]   We do the show Tuesdays, 11 AM Pacific, 2 PM Eastern time.
[02:11:22.140 --> 02:11:23.740]   We will be here for the next few weeks.
[02:11:23.740 --> 02:11:24.740]   Yes.
[02:11:24.740 --> 02:11:27.740]   But we have a best of I think it's really the last chance for you to impact the best
[02:11:27.740 --> 02:11:33.980]   of at twit.tv/bestof because we're going to do that the week of Christmas, right?
[02:11:33.980 --> 02:11:34.980]   Correct.
[02:11:34.980 --> 02:11:37.380]   It'll be our Christmas Eve gift to you.
[02:11:37.380 --> 02:11:38.380]   Correct.
[02:11:38.380 --> 02:11:42.860]   That's December 24th for those of you who have no idea what day Christmas is.
[02:11:42.860 --> 02:11:49.740]   Actually, I suppose there are people like that, but I was in a Kmart or Target the other
[02:11:49.740 --> 02:11:53.580]   day and they have the cards and they had a big sign that says Christmas Day is December
[02:11:53.580 --> 02:11:54.580]   25th.
[02:11:54.580 --> 02:11:55.580]   Like, don't forget.
[02:11:55.580 --> 02:11:56.580]   Just in case.
[02:11:56.580 --> 02:11:57.580]   It's just a reminder.
[02:11:57.580 --> 02:11:59.220]   It's worth the Doc's Christmas Leo.
[02:11:59.220 --> 02:12:01.100]   Ah, that's the problem.
[02:12:01.100 --> 02:12:02.100]   Metric Christmas.
[02:12:02.100 --> 02:12:03.100]   It's Met.
[02:12:03.100 --> 02:12:04.100]   Canadian Christmas.
[02:12:04.100 --> 02:12:05.100]   It's in October.
[02:12:05.100 --> 02:12:07.420]   1900 UTC is when we do this show.
[02:12:07.420 --> 02:12:10.660]   If you want to join us anywhere in the world, we love having you.
[02:12:10.660 --> 02:12:13.540]   And I'm sorry to say, break time is over.
[02:12:13.540 --> 02:12:14.540]   So.
[02:12:14.540 --> 02:12:15.540]   Actor.
[02:12:15.540 --> 02:12:16.540]   Thanks everybody.
