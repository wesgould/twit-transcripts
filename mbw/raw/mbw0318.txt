[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000]   I can't say the Mac news.
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   Well, dig. Somebody sent me a nasty email last week saying you just talked about the iPhone 5.
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   Well, it was being released.
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   Excuse me.
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:54.000]   Guess what?
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   It's going to be a lot of iPhone 5 news today too.
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   And if I can find any Mac news, I promise you, I will insert it at some point.
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   But first, let's introduce our fine panel.
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   Starting to my left with Andy Ennato from the Chicago Sun Times,
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   who's been doing a little camera testing on the iPhone 5.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   We'll talk about that in a moment.
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   Stranger.
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000]   Alex Lindsey is in the house.
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.000]   So good to be here.
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   Nice to have you.
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   Really appreciate your being here.
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   It's my pleasure.
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   I'll ask you where you've been and where you're going a little bit later on.
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:31.000]   But first, let's say hi to Chris Breen from Macworld Magazine, Macworld.com, the Mac Daddy.
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   Hey, Chris.
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   It's good to have you.
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   Welcome.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   Thanks.
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   We brought, we got the A team for this show because, yes, the new iPhone's here.
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   Got it on Friday.
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   Everybody got theirs?
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   I didn't get it.
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   What?
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   I mean, I have decision paralysis.
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   Well, I don't blame you.
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   So, you know, it's funny because, you know, this is what Apple's been so good at avoiding,
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   is decision paralysis, like to give you only a handful of.
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   Right.
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   And so for me, I was, I had declared that I was going to go to Verizon because I was tired
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   of AT&T.
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   And then everyone talked me out of it online because they were like, no.
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   And you were, and they were wrong.
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   Go ahead.
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   So I'm still.
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   I'll tell you why you want to know why they were wrong.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   What were they wrong?
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   First of all, we have LTE and Hiaen Petaluma.
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   Can I just show you the speeds that I'm getting on this thing?
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   Do you think you'll miss the data and the voice?
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   No, but that is the negative.
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   And then you know the one, okay, let me run a speed test.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   And while we're talking, I'll tell you the other great thing about this because you travel
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   a lot.
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   Right.
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000]   Verizon did not lock the SIM card.
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   Look at that.
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   So the SIM, now it's actually slowed down quite a bit.
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   This is interesting.
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   It's because everyone knows everybody.
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   Everybody got their eye.
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   So only eight and a half megabits down.
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   Wow, this is lots slower than it was.
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   I'll show you that everybody got their iPhones.
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   And five meg, oh, wait a minute.
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   I'm on.
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   I'm sorry.
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   I'm on my Wi-Fi.
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   Let me turn off Wi-Fi.
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   No wonder we wouldn't want to get something slow like your eye.
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   It's so slow.
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   Wow.
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   What's wrong with this?
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   LTE is faster than the copper that's actually going through my office.
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   Can you believe it?
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000]   I mean, that really is true though.
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   I mean, wow, that's slow.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   Oh, it's Wi-Fi.
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   Oh, I get about 35 to 40 megabits.
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   Now watch.
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   Stand back.
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   55 millisecond pin, which is excellent.
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   Wow.
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:15.000]   It's smooth.
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   You see why I was disappointed.
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   27 and a half megabits down.
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   The upload actually is really bad right now.
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.000]   That's interesting because usually it's about five or six megabits.
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   It was only one and a half megabits.
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   Still more than adequate for a phone.
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:31.000]   Well, so that's the argument.
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   That's Verizon LTE.
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:33.000]   We don't get AT and TLTE.
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   And traveling is better with Verizon.
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.000]   Because they didn't lock the GSM.
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   So you can pop your SIM.
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.000]   You could run an AT&T phone on this thing.
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   Sim chip card on this.
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000]   And they asked Verizon, are you going to fix it?
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:47.000]   They said no.
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   No, I wonder if they did it by accident.
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   Or on purpose.
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   Or on purpose.
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   But this is an unlocked GSM phone and a CDMA phone.
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   So to me, that outweighs the fact that you can't do voice and data.
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000]   How often do you do voice and data?
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:03.000]   All the time.
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   Oh, well.
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:05.000]   I'm talking on the phone.
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:06.000]   Going to a map.
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   You know, so the, because I'm driving.
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   Not driving.
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.000]   That's the only negative of using a Sprinter Verizon.
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:17.000]   Also, so I got, what's funny is that AT&T, you know, so I, so people talk me out of it.
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000]   And I, so then I was going to get an AT&T.
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.000]   And so yesterday I didn't order one because I couldn't decide what I wanted.
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   So your paralysis was not on the phone itself.
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:25.000]   It was on the camera.
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:26.000]   Oh, yeah.
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:27.000]   I was going to get an iPhone.
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   It was just like which one?
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   Right.
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000]   So then, so then I called AT&T and I was going to go pick one up in Santa Rosa yesterday.
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.560]   Because I, because it said, you know, two, three weeks delivery after the first day.
[00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:36.200]   So I was like, I'll just pick one up.
[00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:41.800]   So I called them and, and they said that I still had to pay $400, you know, for, you
[00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:44.120]   know, AT&T was not going to give me the upgrade.
[00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:48.440]   You know, so I was going to pay $400 for the phone rather than just getting, you know,
[00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:53.520]   whatever the $200 for the phone, whatever the, the number is.
[00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:56.280]   And so I, so I got, I got stuck.
[00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:58.680]   So I had to pay, you know, so, so I had to think about it.
[00:05:58.680 --> 00:05:59.680]   Yeah.
[00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:00.680]   Well, those are all reasons to think.
[00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:02.280]   So it caused me to pause.
[00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:05.120]   Because you paused, you snooze, you lose, dude.
[00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:06.120]   No.
[00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:08.000]   You, what, I mean, what, what is the wait time now?
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.360]   Oh, they, they, they get a small shipment of them at the Apple stores like everybody.
[00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:12.840]   So you just show up at the right time.
[00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:13.840]   Show up in the morning.
[00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:16.360]   You know, I mean, eventually I won't show up in the morning.
[00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:17.720]   You know, someone will show up in the morning.
[00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:18.720]   Right.
[00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:24.440]   So the, the, so anyway, so that's, that's the, um, uh, so I'll get one this week.
[00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:28.800]   So the story is, but I'm going to get Verizon that you could get a voice and data.
[00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:31.160]   And I know, I say this to the people because I know I'm going to get emails.
[00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:34.480]   But wait a minute, on my Galaxy S3, I get voice and data on Verizon.
[00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:35.840]   That's because they put three antennas in.
[00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:38.000]   You have to have an extra antenna if you're going to do that.
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.320]   And Apple elected not to do that partly.
[00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:43.480]   I imagine to keep it small and thin and light.
[00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:48.800]   So which, so Andy, uh, did you get an iPhone five or you probably have a review unit?
[00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:51.240]   Um, I'm trying to decide whether I want to buy one or not.
[00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:52.240]   Yeah.
[00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:55.680]   Because if I'm going to use something day for day, I can't use a loan or I can't use someone
[00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:57.040]   else's property.
[00:06:57.040 --> 00:07:02.080]   And I'm trying to figure out whether I, my, my only problem with the iPhone five is I'm
[00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:06.800]   not sure if I'm a big fan of the shape of it because it's longer, but I don't, I personally
[00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:10.480]   don't find long, uh, longer phones as useful as larger phones.
[00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:11.480]   I agree.
[00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:15.000]   And so I'm trying to figure out if maybe I want to stick around with my 4s, but you're
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:16.000]   absolutely right.
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:17.760]   I mean, the LTE is fantastic.
[00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:23.240]   I mean, I've never had LTE on my primary phone and that's so alluring to be able to
[00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:28.800]   just, you know, we've all been, we've all been in that situation where we need to get
[00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:32.160]   some mail down or we need to send something or post something before we can just pack
[00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:39.160]   up and leave or because your flight is boarding and oh man, 4G is just nothing compared LTE.
[00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:43.080]   So are you on AT and TLT or Verizon LTE?
[00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:47.040]   I'm on AT and T, which is, which is another factor because I'm grandfathered in on both
[00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:48.920]   my iPad and iPhone.
[00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:51.200]   And so I'm not sure if I want to get rid of unlimited data just yet.
[00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:55.320]   So they, you know, whether you, whether you, whether continues to be functionally unlimited
[00:07:55.320 --> 00:07:58.920]   as opposed to simply legally unlimited, that's, that remains to be seen.
[00:07:58.920 --> 00:08:02.680]   And do you have test results on the LTE on your AT&T?
[00:08:02.680 --> 00:08:04.920]   Yeah, it's pretty damn sick.
[00:08:04.920 --> 00:08:09.720]   It's a, it's a little bit slower than the Verizon, but the fastest speed I got in downtown
[00:08:09.720 --> 00:08:13.840]   Boston was I believe it's been like 30 little, a little over 30 megabytes.
[00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:14.840]   Holy cow.
[00:08:14.840 --> 00:08:15.840]   Yeah.
[00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:16.840]   I think it's very much dependent on where you are.
[00:08:16.840 --> 00:08:21.640]   And most, it seems that most of the magazines say PC Mag does these tests and so forth that
[00:08:21.640 --> 00:08:24.480]   LTE is fastest on AT&T.
[00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:28.160]   But there, I think the differences aren't huge and it's really fast.
[00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:29.320]   I mean, I, yeah, it's funny.
[00:08:29.320 --> 00:08:33.360]   You're really, I'm tempted for instance to do my app updates on LTV.
[00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:36.400]   I'm like, I'm going to hit that cap real quick.
[00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:40.600]   Yeah, I have, isn't that the frustrating thing though, because do you still get those warnings?
[00:08:40.600 --> 00:08:43.760]   If you want to update, I move like iPhone, which says, I'm sorry, the software update
[00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:44.760]   is more than 40 megabytes.
[00:08:44.760 --> 00:08:46.160]   I repeat to let you download it.
[00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:48.960]   But it's going to take slower and I'll let it over my fight.
[00:08:48.960 --> 00:08:51.320]   I want to know.
[00:08:51.320 --> 00:08:54.000]   Chris Breen, what do you, what do you have there?
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.080]   I have this fine device right here.
[00:08:56.080 --> 00:08:58.680]   That's a, that's a rocker.
[00:08:58.680 --> 00:08:59.680]   No, it's a rocker.
[00:08:59.680 --> 00:09:00.680]   Yeah, I don't know.
[00:09:00.680 --> 00:09:01.680]   Wow.
[00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:05.600]   But it's amazing that that had, you could put, I think you could put a hundred songs
[00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:09.280]   on there and yeah, you could put a hundred songs on here and it only takes about an hour
[00:09:09.280 --> 00:09:10.280]   to take them.
[00:09:10.280 --> 00:09:14.120]   And, and I think there's like one megapixel back here in the camera.
[00:09:14.120 --> 00:09:16.720]   So it's, this is a really amazing device.
[00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:18.280]   I think it's actually 1.2.
[00:09:18.280 --> 00:09:19.280]   That was the first one.
[00:09:19.280 --> 00:09:20.280]   Was that one?
[00:09:20.280 --> 00:09:21.280]   One iPhone, first phone deal that Apple did.
[00:09:21.280 --> 00:09:25.520]   Yeah, this is the, this is the very first iPhone and that's what it's good for.
[00:09:25.520 --> 00:09:30.160]   So, by the way, you can do that and it still works.
[00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:31.720]   Yeah, exactly right.
[00:09:31.720 --> 00:09:33.320]   This on the other hand, shattered.
[00:09:33.320 --> 00:09:34.560]   No, yeah, don't.
[00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:35.560]   Please.
[00:09:35.560 --> 00:09:40.100]   So I didn't get an iPhone 5 because last year I wasn't up to contract and so I went
[00:09:40.100 --> 00:09:43.640]   and got my 4s and they charged me 700 and 50 dollars.
[00:09:43.640 --> 00:09:46.840]   I know, off contract, it's so expensive.
[00:09:46.840 --> 00:09:50.680]   So this year I went back and said, well, great, I paid full boat for it last time.
[00:09:50.680 --> 00:09:51.680]   So I should get the discount.
[00:09:51.680 --> 00:09:55.440]   And they said, no, if you want it now, you're going to have to pay 700 and you get $60.
[00:09:55.440 --> 00:09:56.440]   Yeah.
[00:09:56.440 --> 00:10:00.600]   Did you do something that automatically increased your, your contract or something?
[00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:03.120]   No, no, I've never left the contract.
[00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:06.080]   I've always been on, but I've upgraded every single year.
[00:10:06.080 --> 00:10:08.160]   And for some reason, I needed it.
[00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:13.240]   You know, the scam they play, I think is even if you pay full freight, if you upgrade,
[00:10:13.240 --> 00:10:14.840]   your clock starts ticking again.
[00:10:14.840 --> 00:10:15.840]   Right.
[00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:20.120]   So you're at one year every year, every year that they've had this, there's always been
[00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:22.880]   AT&T says, well, we're going to ignore it this time.
[00:10:22.880 --> 00:10:23.880]   They didn't do it this time.
[00:10:23.880 --> 00:10:28.840]   And I was told there's a, there's the scuttlebutt from my Twitter followers is that, is that
[00:10:28.840 --> 00:10:30.880]   it's something to connect with the unlimited usage.
[00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:35.000]   So if you're an unlimited user, it, it, it appears the rumor is that it, that you're
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:38.800]   getting different, you're getting treated differently than if I, because I am an unlimited
[00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:39.800]   user and I am too.
[00:10:39.800 --> 00:10:41.200]   And that's when I got price.
[00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:46.880]   Yeah, when I look at that price, I think Verizon really looks tempting at this point.
[00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:47.880]   I'm done.
[00:10:47.880 --> 00:10:50.880]   I mean, after, after having that conversation, I was kind of taken aback by it.
[00:10:50.880 --> 00:10:53.080]   Um, because I'm a pretty high usage user.
[00:10:53.080 --> 00:10:57.480]   And I was kind of taken aback that they, you know, that, that I wasn't going to get upgraded.
[00:10:57.480 --> 00:11:01.320]   And, uh, and I just, I took me a day to think about it and I've decided I'm just going
[00:11:01.320 --> 00:11:02.320]   to drop it.
[00:11:02.320 --> 00:11:07.560]   Well, and as Andy intimated, unlimited on AT&T merely means that you get throttled at
[00:11:07.560 --> 00:11:11.160]   your right and throttled so badly that you, you might as well not use it.
[00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:12.160]   Right.
[00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:15.640]   So yes, I'm moving over.
[00:11:15.640 --> 00:11:16.640]   But that's why I didn't have it today.
[00:11:16.640 --> 00:11:20.040]   And then I had to, are you going to go to the store tomorrow and get it?
[00:11:20.040 --> 00:11:21.280]   Yeah, most likely tomorrow with Thursday.
[00:11:21.280 --> 00:11:22.960]   I think you can make a reservation ahead, right?
[00:11:22.960 --> 00:11:24.120]   You call ahead and say, I want that.
[00:11:24.120 --> 00:11:25.680]   They said right now it's like, you can't do that.
[00:11:25.680 --> 00:11:26.680]   Not right now.
[00:11:26.680 --> 00:11:27.680]   First cup for a service.
[00:11:27.680 --> 00:11:28.680]   Yeah.
[00:11:28.680 --> 00:11:29.680]   Have you tried to just go into Verizon store?
[00:11:29.680 --> 00:11:31.560]   I've been saying that's where I've been sending people and they've all been saying,
[00:11:31.560 --> 00:11:34.440]   yep, I may, I may break down and go to the Verizon store.
[00:11:34.440 --> 00:11:39.480]   The problem when you go to the right, any of the phone stores is that it is a, um, like
[00:11:39.480 --> 00:11:44.200]   dealing with the Apple, the Apple care and everything else is just much more of a pain.
[00:11:44.200 --> 00:11:45.400]   Really interesting phenomenon.
[00:11:45.400 --> 00:11:49.040]   Apple says we sold five million, right?
[00:11:49.040 --> 00:11:52.080]   iPhone fives in the first weekend.
[00:11:52.080 --> 00:11:54.120]   That's one million more than they sold for us.
[00:11:54.120 --> 00:11:57.880]   And the stock market, you mean it wasn't 10?
[00:11:57.880 --> 00:12:03.200]   It was 10 because at least eight, because some boneheaded animal said it was, it was
[00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:04.040]   going to be 10.
[00:12:04.040 --> 00:12:05.840]   And so everybody said, well, it's not 10.
[00:12:05.840 --> 00:12:06.840]   What a disappointment.
[00:12:06.840 --> 00:12:12.320]   Five million phones in two days is what is wrong with this world.
[00:12:12.320 --> 00:12:18.040]   Anyway, it's, you know, if you ask me if the chance to get Apple stock at a reduced price,
[00:12:18.040 --> 00:12:22.120]   if you, I don't buy stock, but if you were going to do that, all it means is the stock
[00:12:22.120 --> 00:12:24.680]   market's stupid, but there are.
[00:12:24.680 --> 00:12:26.240]   That's nothing to do with users.
[00:12:26.240 --> 00:12:27.240]   So I love them.
[00:12:27.240 --> 00:12:28.240]   Yeah.
[00:12:28.240 --> 00:12:32.680]   I mean, if if if analysts were, I bet all analysts who like make predictions like that,
[00:12:32.680 --> 00:12:36.200]   their children tend to move out of the house and join the Navy at age 17.
[00:12:36.200 --> 00:12:39.640]   And the third time that happens, maybe the other spouse wonders, maybe has something
[00:12:39.640 --> 00:12:42.440]   to do with your parenting technique bill that they all believe you.
[00:12:42.440 --> 00:12:46.080]   They can never, they know they can never make you happy.
[00:12:46.080 --> 00:12:49.240]   I love saying I projected that you were going to get an aid this term.
[00:12:49.240 --> 00:12:50.240]   I love the minus.
[00:12:50.240 --> 00:12:57.880]   I love the after the fact, justifications that the nutty analysts had for why they missed
[00:12:57.880 --> 00:13:00.320]   the mark, you know.
[00:13:00.320 --> 00:13:04.240]   And I have to say it doesn't seem credible because now you're back pedaling and saying,
[00:13:04.240 --> 00:13:09.040]   well, no, no, it would have been 10 if and the, this consensus seems to be, there was
[00:13:09.040 --> 00:13:14.320]   a constraint on some piece of the gene, Gene Munster, who's, you know, the Piper,
[00:13:14.320 --> 00:13:18.640]   Jeffrey analyst, who said it was going to be six to 10 million.
[00:13:18.640 --> 00:13:20.760]   They actually ate million.
[00:13:20.760 --> 00:13:24.600]   So he says, this morning, Apple announced the sale of five million iPhone five S is
[00:13:24.600 --> 00:13:28.560]   in the first week and compared to our eight million estimate, we believe there are two
[00:13:28.560 --> 00:13:32.000]   factors that negatively impacted the number.
[00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.800]   Two reasons we got it wrong.
[00:13:34.800 --> 00:13:39.920]   First our sales expectation assumed Apple would include all phones pre-ordered online.
[00:13:39.920 --> 00:13:45.920]   Apparently Apple's not allowed to count those phones until they are signed for at the, by
[00:13:45.920 --> 00:13:47.560]   the customer.
[00:13:47.560 --> 00:13:52.600]   Second, we noted, and then it goes on and on, our eight million estimate assumed full weekend
[00:13:52.600 --> 00:13:55.760]   availability and accounting of all online pre-orders.
[00:13:55.760 --> 00:13:59.360]   Now, this is the bottom, this is the one where I think everybody's kind of saying this.
[00:13:59.360 --> 00:14:04.460]   We believe if supply were not a constraint and all Apple pre-orders were counted, the
[00:14:04.460 --> 00:14:07.440]   launch weekend number would have been close to seven to eight million.
[00:14:07.440 --> 00:14:11.040]   In other words, our number, the, the, it seems to be there's a lot of people saying it's
[00:14:11.040 --> 00:14:12.480]   this new screen.
[00:14:12.480 --> 00:14:16.320]   LG couldn't make enough of these screens.
[00:14:16.320 --> 00:14:17.320]   It's always something.
[00:14:17.320 --> 00:14:20.480]   It's always something because when you have to make five million of anything, it's hard
[00:14:20.480 --> 00:14:21.480]   to go.
[00:14:21.480 --> 00:14:22.480]   All those pieces.
[00:14:22.480 --> 00:14:23.480]   This is happened year after year.
[00:14:23.480 --> 00:14:24.480]   Right.
[00:14:24.480 --> 00:14:28.760]   You know, they have so many iPhones and then they're out and then you order, for example,
[00:14:28.760 --> 00:14:30.280]   you say, yes, you'll get yours next week.
[00:14:30.280 --> 00:14:34.160]   And then in 48 hours later, they say, oh, well, actually it's going to be two weeks.
[00:14:34.160 --> 00:14:35.720]   And now it's going to be three weeks.
[00:14:35.720 --> 00:14:40.160]   So for them to use this as an excuse that all well supplies were constrained.
[00:14:40.160 --> 00:14:41.800]   Yes.
[00:14:41.800 --> 00:14:42.800]   That's what happens.
[00:14:42.800 --> 00:14:44.960]   And this happens every single time.
[00:14:44.960 --> 00:14:48.600]   So, you know, the real problem is you don't know what you're talking about.
[00:14:48.600 --> 00:14:52.040]   It seems to me if you'd taken the four million of last year and added a million, that would
[00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:54.040]   be about right.
[00:14:54.040 --> 00:14:56.600]   And next year, guess what?
[00:14:56.600 --> 00:14:58.320]   It'll be six million, right?
[00:14:58.320 --> 00:15:01.160]   Whatever number the iPhone is, add one to that.
[00:15:01.160 --> 00:15:02.160]   There you go.
[00:15:02.160 --> 00:15:06.120]   So, iPhone five and S stands for half a million.
[00:15:06.120 --> 00:15:08.560]   So next one is five point.
[00:15:08.560 --> 00:15:09.560]   Andy's law.
[00:15:09.560 --> 00:15:11.560]   Andy's law of iPhone sales.
[00:15:11.560 --> 00:15:16.480]   I think, no, well, I admit this is the equivalent of, sometimes they do those little stock contests
[00:15:16.480 --> 00:15:20.880]   where they have five different analysts go against just a monkey like popping balloons.
[00:15:20.880 --> 00:15:22.480]   I am that monkey popping balloons.
[00:15:22.480 --> 00:15:23.480]   I'm trying to predict.
[00:15:23.480 --> 00:15:24.480]   If you win, congratulations.
[00:15:24.480 --> 00:15:27.200]   Hey, do we, I don't think we do you remember today?
[00:15:27.200 --> 00:15:29.080]   We keep track of what our predictions were.
[00:15:29.080 --> 00:15:31.960]   Cause I think I said some silly number like eight million as well.
[00:15:31.960 --> 00:15:33.800]   I think I said a lot.
[00:15:33.800 --> 00:15:34.800]   10 million.
[00:15:34.800 --> 00:15:36.000]   10 million, I think you said.
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:37.000]   I usually am.
[00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:38.920]   Andy, I think you got it right.
[00:15:38.920 --> 00:15:42.040]   I remember saying I think it was somewhere around four or five.
[00:15:42.040 --> 00:15:43.680]   But again, I was just, I think we got it right.
[00:15:43.680 --> 00:15:46.800]   But we don't, we're not, hey, we're not as well connected as Horace.
[00:15:46.800 --> 00:15:51.120]   Did you or, you know, Gene Munster, those guys are connected.
[00:15:51.120 --> 00:15:52.120]   They know.
[00:15:52.120 --> 00:15:56.120]   Um, in any event, I think we can say this and I sure Apple said it.
[00:15:56.120 --> 00:15:59.960]   This is the best selling iPhone in history, the fastest selling iPhone in history.
[00:15:59.960 --> 00:16:02.200]   Once again, they broke all records.
[00:16:02.200 --> 00:16:07.240]   Um, and you know, as always, you get so predictable.
[00:16:07.240 --> 00:16:12.560]   So the, the, the curve now is very standard and I'm sure it'll be this way for a while.
[00:16:12.560 --> 00:16:18.200]   The result comes out, uh, the, uh, the iPhone is announced and the trade press and the pundits
[00:16:18.200 --> 00:16:19.200]   are disappointed.
[00:16:19.200 --> 00:16:22.520]   Oh, it's only a rev, evolutionary dot revolutionary.
[00:16:22.520 --> 00:16:24.560]   This was just, just boring.
[00:16:24.560 --> 00:16:29.040]   Then the sales numbers come out and it's the best selling iPhone ever and then they
[00:16:29.040 --> 00:16:33.560]   all backpedal and then the next step, which is now what's happening.
[00:16:33.560 --> 00:16:35.520]   They start finding flaw.
[00:16:35.520 --> 00:16:41.080]   So the flaw finding maps, number one, let's take a break and talk about maps.
[00:16:41.080 --> 00:16:44.360]   Uh, and then we'll also talk about whether people are getting scratches.
[00:16:44.360 --> 00:16:47.400]   I haven't had any, any, any bevel scratches.
[00:16:47.400 --> 00:16:49.400]   I mean, I haven't had any at all.
[00:16:49.400 --> 00:16:52.680]   Yours is still pristine in the box on a truck somewhere.
[00:16:52.680 --> 00:16:53.680]   Yeah.
[00:16:53.680 --> 00:16:58.120]   Well, you don't know that is his is probably still in Shenzhen, China.
[00:16:58.120 --> 00:17:04.560]   Uh, we'll also talk about the riots in the, uh, in the Fox con plants and a lot more,
[00:17:04.560 --> 00:17:06.880]   but first a word from our friends at Citrix who do that.
[00:17:06.880 --> 00:17:07.880]   Great.
[00:17:07.880 --> 00:17:08.880]   Go to meeting.
[00:17:08.880 --> 00:17:11.720]   Uh, you, which you can do, by the way, on an iPad and iPhone.
[00:17:11.720 --> 00:17:16.080]   So you start a meeting on a Mac or a Windows PC from your office.
[00:17:16.080 --> 00:17:17.520]   You set up the meeting ahead of time.
[00:17:17.520 --> 00:17:20.600]   You can use your email and send out links, which is really great.
[00:17:20.600 --> 00:17:22.360]   Works really well.
[00:17:22.360 --> 00:17:23.640]   Everybody now has an email.
[00:17:23.640 --> 00:17:25.120]   It's on their calendar too.
[00:17:25.120 --> 00:17:26.600]   If, if, and that's how I have it set up.
[00:17:26.600 --> 00:17:28.600]   So it automatically imports to the calendar.
[00:17:28.600 --> 00:17:30.100]   Thank you.
[00:17:30.100 --> 00:17:31.100]   Look at that.
[00:17:31.100 --> 00:17:32.100]   It's just appeared.
[00:17:32.100 --> 00:17:33.100]   Thank you.
[00:17:33.100 --> 00:17:40.600]   Burke McQuinn, ladies and gentlemen, ask for a USB micro mini and he, and he provides
[00:17:40.600 --> 00:17:41.600]   it.
[00:17:41.600 --> 00:17:44.000]   Um, I'll explain why I wanted that in a little bit.
[00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:45.560]   This is the original Android phone.
[00:17:45.560 --> 00:17:48.160]   We're just going to compare the original iPhone and the original Android.
[00:17:48.160 --> 00:17:49.160]   Ooh.
[00:17:49.160 --> 00:17:50.680]   Anyway, what was I saying?
[00:17:50.680 --> 00:17:51.680]   Oh, yes.
[00:17:51.680 --> 00:17:54.760]   Uh, nowadays people are moving all over the place.
[00:17:54.760 --> 00:17:57.880]   Uh, their offices are spread out all over the world.
[00:17:57.880 --> 00:17:58.880]   Nobody sits still.
[00:17:58.880 --> 00:18:02.480]   So if you want to have a staff meeting or a sales pitch or you want to meet with people,
[00:18:02.480 --> 00:18:04.240]   uh, you got to have to do it online.
[00:18:04.240 --> 00:18:06.720]   And if you're going to do it online, please use the best.
[00:18:06.720 --> 00:18:07.720]   Go to meeting.
[00:18:07.720 --> 00:18:10.640]   And I'll tell you a few reasons why this is the one you want to use.
[00:18:10.640 --> 00:18:12.360]   First of all, very affordable.
[00:18:12.360 --> 00:18:16.320]   Go to meeting $49 a month for as many meetings as you want, as long as you want.
[00:18:16.320 --> 00:18:19.760]   What's the, uh, what's the, what would you say is the average amount of money a company
[00:18:19.760 --> 00:18:23.320]   spends on a teleconferencing setup though, you know, where they have the camp, the big,
[00:18:23.320 --> 00:18:24.480]   I don't want to say the brand.
[00:18:24.480 --> 00:18:27.080]   No, those, you know, thousands, tens of thousands, tens of thousands.
[00:18:27.080 --> 00:18:32.880]   I mean, if you really want, yeah, it's like it could be $100,000 to set up a bridge.
[00:18:32.880 --> 00:18:35.440]   $49 a month.
[00:18:35.440 --> 00:18:37.240]   And by the way, these look, every bit is good.
[00:18:37.240 --> 00:18:40.800]   I got to say the new HD faces is spectacular.
[00:18:40.800 --> 00:18:45.680]   And since every computer now has a HD camera on it, even, even your iPad has a great camera
[00:18:45.680 --> 00:18:47.960]   on it, uh, you don't.
[00:18:47.960 --> 00:18:50.480]   So it's fast.
[00:18:50.480 --> 00:18:51.960]   It's secure.
[00:18:51.960 --> 00:18:53.960]   It's easy to set up a meeting.
[00:18:53.960 --> 00:18:54.960]   Uh, you know, it's expensive.
[00:18:54.960 --> 00:18:59.200]   The expense you want to look at also does not just the, the cost of other teleconferencing,
[00:18:59.200 --> 00:19:01.000]   but just the cost of bringing people into town.
[00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:04.040]   Oh, sadly, you're saving so much money.
[00:19:04.040 --> 00:19:06.000]   This is, this is a way to save money.
[00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:07.520]   Very easy to invite people.
[00:19:07.520 --> 00:19:09.680]   Um, very easy for them to join.
[00:19:09.680 --> 00:19:12.160]   Even if they don't have the software on their machine, which most cases they don't, it's
[00:19:12.160 --> 00:19:15.520]   just a few seconds to download the software, start running it.
[00:19:15.520 --> 00:19:20.000]   You turn on your webcam, they turn on their webcam and you're seeing in crystal clear
[00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:22.480]   HD video, you're seeing each other.
[00:19:22.480 --> 00:19:26.400]   I have to say, and yes, you can join a meeting on an iPhone or an iPad.
[00:19:26.400 --> 00:19:34.200]   Right now the video is only on the iPad, the audio is on the iPhone, but I'm would be
[00:19:34.200 --> 00:19:37.080]   willing to bet that soon they'll have a video on the iPhone as well.
[00:19:37.080 --> 00:19:38.760]   And it's just, I mean, it makes a huge difference.
[00:19:38.760 --> 00:19:43.200]   To be able to see your clients or your colleagues in these meetings, I want you to try it free
[00:19:43.200 --> 00:19:48.080]   for 30 days, not $49 a month, but free for the, for the next month, visit go to meeting.com
[00:19:48.080 --> 00:19:50.280]   and use our offer code Mac break.
[00:19:50.280 --> 00:19:55.160]   Go to meeting.com, use the offer code Mac break, put it on your Mac or your PC, have,
[00:19:55.160 --> 00:19:59.920]   throw a few meetings, have a meeting party and, and try it, show your clients, your
[00:19:59.920 --> 00:20:01.840]   colleagues, show your boss.
[00:20:01.840 --> 00:20:07.440]   I think they'll be impressed unless they spent $100,000 on a teleconferencing room down
[00:20:07.440 --> 00:20:09.520]   all in which case you could get fired.
[00:20:09.520 --> 00:20:10.960]   So don't you?
[00:20:10.960 --> 00:20:14.360]   Wait a minute.
[00:20:14.360 --> 00:20:15.360]   You mean?
[00:20:15.360 --> 00:20:16.360]   Yes.
[00:20:16.360 --> 00:20:17.360]   We spent.
[00:20:17.360 --> 00:20:18.360]   Yes.
[00:20:18.360 --> 00:20:22.080]   It's got screen sharing, everything.
[00:20:22.080 --> 00:20:25.040]   Go to meeting.com, use the offer code Mac break.
[00:20:25.040 --> 00:20:28.680]   All right, let's talk maps.
[00:20:28.680 --> 00:20:30.800]   It's interesting to see the back and forth on this.
[00:20:30.800 --> 00:20:35.680]   If you live in the Falkland Islands, admittedly, not a lot of roads, you don't want to use
[00:20:35.680 --> 00:20:37.760]   maps app on the iPhone 5.
[00:20:37.760 --> 00:20:43.760]   As you all know, I'm sure by now the iOS 6 upgrade, whether it's an iPhone 5 or an
[00:20:43.760 --> 00:20:49.320]   older iPhone or iPad, does not include the old maps app, which was not, I wanted to
[00:20:49.320 --> 00:20:51.240]   say Google maps is not a Google maps app.
[00:20:51.240 --> 00:20:53.680]   It's an Apple maps app that uses Google data.
[00:20:53.680 --> 00:20:54.680]   And that's important.
[00:20:54.680 --> 00:20:57.640]   Apple was the one that wrote that app, but they used Google data.
[00:20:57.640 --> 00:20:59.760]   They decided to stop using Google data.
[00:20:59.760 --> 00:21:01.520]   That's really what the change has been.
[00:21:01.520 --> 00:21:02.720]   So let's make that clear.
[00:21:02.720 --> 00:21:05.760]   In both cases, those were Apple apps, right?
[00:21:05.760 --> 00:21:07.200]   But they've stopped using Google data.
[00:21:07.200 --> 00:21:09.280]   They're now using their own mapping data.
[00:21:09.280 --> 00:21:12.080]   They bought data from Tom, Tom, and other sources.
[00:21:12.080 --> 00:21:15.520]   They've got traffic data built in.
[00:21:15.520 --> 00:21:18.120]   And there have been complaints.
[00:21:18.120 --> 00:21:21.960]   In fact, perhaps some hubris on Apple's part thinking, hey, no problem.
[00:21:21.960 --> 00:21:23.600]   Easy to do a maps app.
[00:21:23.600 --> 00:21:25.760]   So in some areas, it's terrible.
[00:21:25.760 --> 00:21:29.760]   But you know, I just saw an article that said it's the best mapping app far better than
[00:21:29.760 --> 00:21:32.680]   Google maps in China.
[00:21:32.680 --> 00:21:36.760]   Because it turns out that Apple bought its China mapping data from a Chinese company.
[00:21:36.760 --> 00:21:38.200]   Google was using its own data.
[00:21:38.200 --> 00:21:40.440]   And the Chinese data is much better on apps.
[00:21:40.440 --> 00:21:43.560]   So if you visit China, an iPhone 5 is the way to go.
[00:21:43.560 --> 00:21:48.040]   Well, by the way, that's a pretty big market for Apple.
[00:21:48.040 --> 00:21:51.000]   So I think the first thing to say is--
[00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:53.000]   All the factory workers have an easy time getting to it.
[00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:54.000]   Right.
[00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:55.000]   Get to your bunk.
[00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:57.160]   If they had an iPhone.
[00:21:57.160 --> 00:21:59.240]   If they had a bunk.
[00:21:59.240 --> 00:22:02.800]   If it's really dependent on where you are.
[00:22:02.800 --> 00:22:06.040]   If you're in San Francisco Bay Area as we are, maps work flawlessly.
[00:22:06.040 --> 00:22:09.160]   Chris, have you tried using the maps on the iPhone 5?
[00:22:09.160 --> 00:22:10.560]   Yeah, I've used them.
[00:22:10.560 --> 00:22:13.280]   And I'm out in the sticks a little bit outside the Bay Area.
[00:22:13.280 --> 00:22:15.560]   And it seems to be working fine.
[00:22:15.560 --> 00:22:19.880]   But like you have heard lots of reports from people who do a side by side comparison with
[00:22:19.880 --> 00:22:23.920]   the old maps app, the new one, and say, well, look, here's the detail on the old one.
[00:22:23.920 --> 00:22:25.640]   And there are lots and lots of roads.
[00:22:25.640 --> 00:22:27.360]   And the new one, there's like two roads.
[00:22:27.360 --> 00:22:31.360]   And so people are naturally not very happy with it.
[00:22:31.360 --> 00:22:36.280]   One of our chatters who's in Japan says, if you're in Japan, it's horrible.
[00:22:36.280 --> 00:22:39.320]   One thing about the Google Maps in Japan is it works really, really well.
[00:22:39.320 --> 00:22:41.520]   I mean, so you're able to get subway information.
[00:22:41.520 --> 00:22:45.840]   I mean, every time I'm there, I mean, I just-- you can really enjoy Tokyo.
[00:22:45.840 --> 00:22:49.480]   Well, that's one-- another thing is transit information is gone from these.
[00:22:49.480 --> 00:22:50.480]   It's really important.
[00:22:50.480 --> 00:22:51.480]   So it's street view.
[00:22:51.480 --> 00:22:55.320]   So those are two things that are gone that Google does and others do not.
[00:22:55.320 --> 00:22:57.640]   You can't-- you know, there's-- what is it called?
[00:22:57.640 --> 00:22:58.640]   Hopstop?
[00:22:58.640 --> 00:23:01.040]   There's some good transit apps.
[00:23:01.040 --> 00:23:02.040]   But Google--
[00:23:02.040 --> 00:23:03.040]   There's a button for it.
[00:23:03.040 --> 00:23:07.200]   And we'll ask you to go ahead the app store and download a free or paid app to get this
[00:23:07.200 --> 00:23:08.200]   done.
[00:23:08.200 --> 00:23:10.040]   So it's at least a third party app that will be integrated in there.
[00:23:10.040 --> 00:23:11.840]   But that's a big hit.
[00:23:11.840 --> 00:23:13.320]   So a couple of things.
[00:23:13.320 --> 00:23:15.720]   First of all, is this a problem?
[00:23:15.720 --> 00:23:16.720]   Yeah.
[00:23:16.720 --> 00:23:17.720]   I think in the short term, it's a problem.
[00:23:17.720 --> 00:23:23.360]   I think the issue that Apple-- you think that Apple would learn from the past every once
[00:23:23.360 --> 00:23:24.360]   in a while.
[00:23:24.360 --> 00:23:26.440]   I know they looked into the future and not in the past.
[00:23:26.440 --> 00:23:29.560]   But with Final Cut Pro, they released a brand new version.
[00:23:29.560 --> 00:23:32.680]   They got rid of the old version immediately and everyone freaked out.
[00:23:32.680 --> 00:23:36.720]   If they'd left the other version and added the new version and had them run parallel
[00:23:36.720 --> 00:23:39.480]   for a little while, we all would have liked-- no one would have freaked out.
[00:23:39.480 --> 00:23:40.480]   Or there's less of a--
[00:23:40.480 --> 00:23:41.480]   Well, this is--
[00:23:41.480 --> 00:23:46.160]   The problem is is that by just shutting off one app and then giving everybody a new app
[00:23:46.160 --> 00:23:50.040]   that doesn't work as well as the first app for some people, I think that's what's getting
[00:23:50.040 --> 00:23:51.040]   them into a lot of hot water.
[00:23:51.040 --> 00:23:55.680]   They could have put this out as a quote unquote beta and run it for two or three months before
[00:23:55.680 --> 00:23:56.840]   they got rid of the other one.
[00:23:56.840 --> 00:23:58.720]   I mean, that's the only thing that I'd say.
[00:23:58.720 --> 00:23:59.800]   It's a different situation though.
[00:23:59.800 --> 00:24:04.320]   I mean, the problem with Final Cut 10 was it was functional for what it did.
[00:24:04.320 --> 00:24:06.280]   All the features that were there were.
[00:24:06.280 --> 00:24:09.400]   People were upset that they'd removed a couple of features and that the user interface was
[00:24:09.400 --> 00:24:10.400]   so different.
[00:24:10.400 --> 00:24:14.200]   With Maps, your first weekend with this was probably a horrible experience.
[00:24:14.200 --> 00:24:19.480]   In the Boston area, there's a point with the brand new piece of technology where I'm
[00:24:19.480 --> 00:24:22.920]   not even trying to test it, I'm not trying to make it break, I'm just trying to use it
[00:24:22.920 --> 00:24:23.920]   the way a consumer would.
[00:24:23.920 --> 00:24:28.080]   And for the first few days, it was a total fail where I would try to get it to route
[00:24:28.080 --> 00:24:29.080]   me to--
[00:24:29.080 --> 00:24:33.920]   But that gets my point is that just leaving Google Maps available would have been, you
[00:24:33.920 --> 00:24:38.280]   know, had a lot less people, like just have this come out as a beta and run for three
[00:24:38.280 --> 00:24:41.520]   months and figure out these issues before you took it away from everybody.
[00:24:41.520 --> 00:24:44.160]   Well, to be fair, we don't know what all the issues are.
[00:24:44.160 --> 00:24:45.480]   Google is saying that--
[00:24:45.480 --> 00:24:50.040]   Google CL was had a sort of an off the cuff remark about saying that they would have
[00:24:50.040 --> 00:24:55.240]   been open to the idea of letting Apple continue to use Google Maps.
[00:24:55.240 --> 00:24:59.040]   Although he didn't go into details of, well, did you ask for like $3 billion a year to
[00:24:59.040 --> 00:25:00.040]   license it?
[00:25:00.040 --> 00:25:04.680]   Well, you don't know what the point it was where Apple and Google decided that they were
[00:25:04.680 --> 00:25:05.680]   going to continue the agreement.
[00:25:05.680 --> 00:25:09.320]   So I'm not going to say whether Apple had the-- even had the option of doing Google
[00:25:09.320 --> 00:25:10.320]   Maps in--
[00:25:10.320 --> 00:25:13.240]   No, no, but I don't mean using Google Maps in their own app.
[00:25:13.240 --> 00:25:18.920]   I mean, start their own app completely running on its own three months ago on the old OS
[00:25:18.920 --> 00:25:22.440]   and have it just running and trying to figure out what these issues are while you still--
[00:25:22.440 --> 00:25:26.960]   while we still had a map program available to us, you know, whereas now--
[00:25:26.960 --> 00:25:28.560]   I mean, you can go to Google--
[00:25:28.560 --> 00:25:32.280]   maps.google.com or whatever in your browser and that's what some people are doing.
[00:25:32.280 --> 00:25:33.720]   So that's the work around.
[00:25:33.720 --> 00:25:38.040]   It just seems like it's a-- if you-- and by the way, if you bookmark that and put it
[00:25:38.040 --> 00:25:41.560]   in there, it's almost the same experience as what you had before.
[00:25:41.560 --> 00:25:45.760]   So that's a fine backup, but I just think that the idea of cutting it off, I think that's
[00:25:45.760 --> 00:25:47.240]   what's cutting off for one.
[00:25:47.240 --> 00:25:50.440]   And I know that that does get the adoption that's going to increase their sample rate
[00:25:50.440 --> 00:25:53.120]   because a lot of people just would not-- it wouldn't work once and then just stop using
[00:25:53.120 --> 00:25:54.120]   it.
[00:25:54.120 --> 00:25:57.960]   So I get that it's increasing their sample rate, but I think that that's where they're
[00:25:57.960 --> 00:25:58.960]   getting a lot of the heat.
[00:25:58.960 --> 00:25:59.960]   And I think that they'll sort it out.
[00:25:59.960 --> 00:26:03.280]   I mean, I think that they're going to have to spend a lot of money to fix it.
[00:26:03.280 --> 00:26:06.280]   It will get better and as a matter of fact, it already started getting better.
[00:26:06.280 --> 00:26:07.280]   Really already.
[00:26:07.280 --> 00:26:11.520]   Well, I did notice that I took a screen-- I was taking screenshots.
[00:26:11.520 --> 00:26:12.520]   I had a lot of problems.
[00:26:12.520 --> 00:26:16.880]   And one of the first problems I found was that if you ask it, where is the public garden
[00:26:16.880 --> 00:26:22.760]   in the city of Boston, it would take you about seven blocks away to a mall?
[00:26:22.760 --> 00:26:26.640]   That is certainly not the public garden, which is weird because in my screenshot, you
[00:26:26.640 --> 00:26:31.160]   actually see on the map, here is the public garden that is marked by the map as the public
[00:26:31.160 --> 00:26:35.080]   garden, but the destination that it chose for you was actually way, way far away.
[00:26:35.080 --> 00:26:38.000]   Well, and that, by the way, is something Noki and Google both have said.
[00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:39.920]   It's not just the data.
[00:26:39.920 --> 00:26:41.240]   It's the massaging of the data.
[00:26:41.240 --> 00:26:45.760]   It's the integration of data from a variety of disparate sources like Yelp and TomTom
[00:26:45.760 --> 00:26:47.320]   that is tough.
[00:26:47.320 --> 00:26:48.320]   Right.
[00:26:48.320 --> 00:26:52.040]   And I try to get a better screenshot with 3D view off the iPad.
[00:26:52.040 --> 00:26:53.040]   And that was three days later.
[00:26:53.040 --> 00:26:54.040]   And they'd already picked it.
[00:26:54.040 --> 00:26:55.040]   They'd already do a--
[00:26:55.040 --> 00:26:57.000]   You get to the right place.
[00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:03.120]   But I do feel so the maps issue is kind of a purity test for whether you are capable
[00:27:03.120 --> 00:27:07.680]   of judging Apple objectively because there are some people who are saying, "Oh, God,
[00:27:07.680 --> 00:27:09.880]   everyone looks for an opportunity to bash Apple."
[00:27:09.880 --> 00:27:13.480]   Again, for the first two or three days, I would ask it to send me to some place.
[00:27:13.480 --> 00:27:17.160]   It would take me seven miles out of where I actually wanted to go.
[00:27:17.160 --> 00:27:21.200]   There would be places where I would ask where is the closest post office or something.
[00:27:21.200 --> 00:27:23.000]   And I'd be staying in front of a post office.
[00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:25.680]   I would say, "I think there's one in Cambridge.
[00:27:25.680 --> 00:27:29.960]   If you want to hitchhike 40 miles, it's like, "Oh, come on."
[00:27:29.960 --> 00:27:30.960]   So it is--
[00:27:30.960 --> 00:27:32.440]   I don't think it's a disaster.
[00:27:32.440 --> 00:27:37.000]   It really is just a case of they don't have to do is make sure that the data that people
[00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:38.000]   are plugging into is better.
[00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:39.760]   And that's something they could easily change from their end.
[00:27:39.760 --> 00:27:42.600]   So I don't think it's a Hindenburg-style disaster.
[00:27:42.600 --> 00:27:45.040]   But you have to acknowledge that, "No, this does not--"
[00:27:45.040 --> 00:27:48.640]   At least in this first week, it did not work properly.
[00:27:48.640 --> 00:27:51.280]   And how important is it that it did?
[00:27:51.280 --> 00:27:56.560]   Absolutely, because it's sort of like-- imagine if the camera had such a horrible white balance
[00:27:56.560 --> 00:27:58.760]   problem that everybody looked like Mr. Spock.
[00:27:58.760 --> 00:28:02.800]   That's one of the first things people try with their brand new gadget.
[00:28:02.800 --> 00:28:05.840]   It's not the sort of thing where it's subtle where you can say, "Well, gosh, they promised
[00:28:05.840 --> 00:28:06.840]   that it was better in low light."
[00:28:06.840 --> 00:28:10.680]   But this one, I'm not sure if it's actually better in a low light for anything else.
[00:28:10.680 --> 00:28:15.440]   Either it sends you to the place where you want to go or you'll wind up in a vacant lot.
[00:28:15.440 --> 00:28:19.000]   And when you wind up in a vacant lot, you don't say, "Well, what a monumental task
[00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:20.600]   is to create a brand new map in Europe.
[00:28:20.600 --> 00:28:21.760]   This is a month for now."
[00:28:21.760 --> 00:28:25.640]   You say, "Stupid piece of crap, and now I'm locked into this thing for two years."
[00:28:25.640 --> 00:28:29.480]   Well, and there is a good point, which is if you use Siri, you are going to use Apple
[00:28:29.480 --> 00:28:30.480]   Maps.
[00:28:30.480 --> 00:28:31.480]   That's what Siri integrates with.
[00:28:31.480 --> 00:28:33.440]   I mean, I've been saying, "Well, there's other map apps.
[00:28:33.440 --> 00:28:36.280]   As you said, you could use Google's web page.
[00:28:36.280 --> 00:28:37.680]   There are lots of good GPS.
[00:28:37.680 --> 00:28:40.840]   I've always used GPS drive because I want to turn by turn."
[00:28:40.840 --> 00:28:44.440]   But the issue is with all these integration, they built in the great world.
[00:28:44.440 --> 00:28:46.440]   But they don't integrate with Siri.
[00:28:46.440 --> 00:28:52.160]   And Waze is a great example of a mapping, crowdsourced mapping app that just works great.
[00:28:52.160 --> 00:28:53.160]   Sometimes.
[00:28:53.160 --> 00:28:54.160]   Yeah.
[00:28:54.160 --> 00:28:55.160]   We had Tampa, we had Waze on it.
[00:28:55.160 --> 00:28:56.160]   We had Tampa all over Tampa.
[00:28:56.160 --> 00:28:57.160]   We were like, "Really?
[00:28:57.160 --> 00:29:01.400]   I don't think this is the fastest way to get there."
[00:29:01.400 --> 00:29:04.440]   Because it is Apple and it's an Apple app and it's integrated tightly and it's Siri.
[00:29:04.440 --> 00:29:05.800]   And they sold it so heavily.
[00:29:05.800 --> 00:29:07.800]   I mean, I think that might have been the best way.
[00:29:07.800 --> 00:29:10.600]   Is that saying we're going to experiment with something new or we're working on something?
[00:29:10.600 --> 00:29:12.840]   I know it's not very Apple to say that, but the fact that they--
[00:29:12.840 --> 00:29:13.840]   They did a Siri?
[00:29:13.840 --> 00:29:14.840]   Siri's still beta.
[00:29:14.840 --> 00:29:15.840]   Right.
[00:29:15.840 --> 00:29:16.840]   Yeah.
[00:29:16.840 --> 00:29:17.840]   Go ahead, Chris.
[00:29:17.840 --> 00:29:22.760]   Well, I was also thinking that this only underscores this idea that Apple will go for
[00:29:22.760 --> 00:29:24.920]   the whizzy rather than the practical.
[00:29:24.920 --> 00:29:30.660]   And I think once we get outside our little circle of technologists, a normal person
[00:29:30.660 --> 00:29:35.460]   picks up this phone and says, "Okay, what is this app doing for me that the old one
[00:29:35.460 --> 00:29:36.460]   didn't?
[00:29:36.460 --> 00:29:37.460]   What is better about this?"
[00:29:37.460 --> 00:29:39.500]   And that Apple might say, "Oh, look, you get these 3D views."
[00:29:39.500 --> 00:29:40.500]   Right.
[00:29:40.500 --> 00:29:41.500]   Okay.
[00:29:41.500 --> 00:29:42.500]   Pretty don't use it.
[00:29:42.500 --> 00:29:43.500]   Yeah.
[00:29:43.500 --> 00:29:45.740]   What I really want is to be able to see the color of the building I'm going to be going
[00:29:45.740 --> 00:29:46.740]   to by having Street View.
[00:29:46.740 --> 00:29:47.740]   Could I have that?
[00:29:47.740 --> 00:29:48.740]   No, you can't have that.
[00:29:48.740 --> 00:29:49.740]   Okay.
[00:29:49.740 --> 00:29:53.340]   And by the way, you'll probably never have that because how many years has Google been
[00:29:53.340 --> 00:29:55.180]   collecting that?
[00:29:55.180 --> 00:29:56.180]   They have a monopoly.
[00:29:56.180 --> 00:29:57.340]   They have a lock on it.
[00:29:57.340 --> 00:29:58.340]   Right.
[00:29:58.340 --> 00:30:00.140]   So what Apple does is gives us helicopters and airplanes.
[00:30:00.140 --> 00:30:01.140]   Right.
[00:30:01.140 --> 00:30:02.140]   Which looks cool.
[00:30:02.140 --> 00:30:06.820]   But I can't see the color of this market I'm going to in from the helicopter view.
[00:30:06.820 --> 00:30:12.900]   So again, I think the first impression is that this is not better than what I had before.
[00:30:12.900 --> 00:30:13.900]   Why not?
[00:30:13.900 --> 00:30:17.180]   And some people might say, "Well, Apple's having a tip with Google or the other way around,
[00:30:17.180 --> 00:30:18.620]   and that's why you don't get it."
[00:30:18.620 --> 00:30:21.220]   Well, I don't care as a consumer that they have a problem with each other.
[00:30:21.220 --> 00:30:23.660]   I just want the best technology on my phone.
[00:30:23.660 --> 00:30:25.980]   Now, that maps app may turn out to be that.
[00:30:25.980 --> 00:30:30.300]   But I think as Alex says, it would have been nice to have some kind of transition period
[00:30:30.300 --> 00:30:34.180]   if possible so that we could have the old technology and say, "Oh, yeah, this looks
[00:30:34.180 --> 00:30:35.180]   cool.
[00:30:35.180 --> 00:30:37.820]   This is going to be good in three months once they have more data, but right now I'm going
[00:30:37.820 --> 00:30:39.980]   to stick with what I had before."
[00:30:39.980 --> 00:30:43.100]   And I think that Apple has an opportunity to look at what Google's done, for instance,
[00:30:43.100 --> 00:30:44.100]   with Street View.
[00:30:44.100 --> 00:30:47.380]   I mean, that is something that's just a question of money, you know what I mean, which Apple
[00:30:47.380 --> 00:30:48.380]   has.
[00:30:48.380 --> 00:30:53.300]   And if Apple wanted to spend two or $3 billion mapping a lot of the major areas, they could
[00:30:53.300 --> 00:30:54.300]   catch up pretty quickly.
[00:30:54.300 --> 00:30:57.540]   I mean, that technology is, "Wow, it's pretty cool.
[00:30:57.540 --> 00:30:59.940]   It is definitely not at this point."
[00:30:59.940 --> 00:31:04.940]   Yeah, but if there's one thing we're learning now in the smartphone market is it's so competitive
[00:31:04.940 --> 00:31:07.620]   that you may not have time to catch up.
[00:31:07.620 --> 00:31:12.100]   This is the lesson Microsoft has learned with Windows Phone is that so somebody in our
[00:31:12.100 --> 00:31:15.580]   chatroom, Web5812 said, "That's why I'm considering Android."
[00:31:15.580 --> 00:31:19.460]   You're now in a very competitive marketplace and if maps are important to you and Street
[00:31:19.460 --> 00:31:24.900]   View is important to you, I think everybody, not just tech pundits, but real people know,
[00:31:24.900 --> 00:31:29.580]   "Oh, well, if you get an Android phone, you're going to have a better map experience now
[00:31:29.580 --> 00:31:32.100]   built into the phone and Street View."
[00:31:32.100 --> 00:31:38.420]   Now, there is a question, is Google, and this is unclear, Xtmit was kind of evasive yesterday
[00:31:38.420 --> 00:31:43.020]   when asked about this, but is Google making the maps app available on iOS?
[00:31:43.020 --> 00:31:46.740]   I think that's a complicated question for Google because if they leave Apple hanging
[00:31:46.740 --> 00:31:50.300]   and don't produce that app, then it really puts a lot of pressure on the phone.
[00:31:50.300 --> 00:31:56.740]   It's good for Android, but it may also cause the federal government to get involved, right?
[00:31:56.740 --> 00:32:02.340]   Amy, isn't this a fascinating soap opera though?
[00:32:02.340 --> 00:32:06.460]   Even if Google says, "This is our opportunity to reinforce how important and how valuable
[00:32:06.460 --> 00:32:09.780]   our map service is," we're not going to mess around with our customers.
[00:32:09.780 --> 00:32:12.740]   We're going to let them have this app immediately and they're scrambled.
[00:32:12.740 --> 00:32:15.900]   They make sure that whatever they've been building before then is ready to go.
[00:32:15.900 --> 00:32:16.900]   They submitted to the Apple Store.
[00:32:16.900 --> 00:32:21.540]   Now, they have to wonder whether or not Apple's going to approve this wonderful maps app.
[00:32:21.540 --> 00:32:24.220]   There are a lot of variables here.
[00:32:24.220 --> 00:32:28.740]   Just parsing what I should find with the Eric Schmidt article and I'll read you what he
[00:32:28.740 --> 00:32:32.660]   said because he was cagey, but I think I understand what he was talking about.
[00:32:32.660 --> 00:32:37.060]   In the past, Apple has turned down apps that directly compete with apps that are shipping
[00:32:37.060 --> 00:32:39.740]   with the phone, and so they haven't done that all the time.
[00:32:39.740 --> 00:32:43.940]   Well, remember that they got investigated by the Department of Justice and a member of
[00:32:43.940 --> 00:32:47.780]   Congress asked them for an explanation why Google Voice wasn't in the store.
[00:32:47.780 --> 00:32:52.940]   After that, they stopped holding, for instance, Chrome right away.
[00:32:52.940 --> 00:32:59.220]   I think that Apple, this is a little bit chasing Apple when it comes to that.
[00:32:59.220 --> 00:33:04.540]   Eric Schmidt was talking to reporters in Tokyo yesterday.
[00:33:04.540 --> 00:33:05.540]   Here's what he said.
[00:33:05.540 --> 00:33:06.540]   This is from Reuters.
[00:33:06.540 --> 00:33:09.620]   The quote was, "Apple would have to approve."
[00:33:09.620 --> 00:33:12.900]   We haven't done anything yet with Google Maps.
[00:33:12.900 --> 00:33:14.220]   Apple would have to approve it.
[00:33:14.220 --> 00:33:17.540]   It's their choice.
[00:33:17.540 --> 00:33:22.300]   Implying that they hadn't in fact written an app to submit to the store, but I think
[00:33:22.300 --> 00:33:29.020]   it's more complicated than that because I think in fact, Google wouldn't just like any
[00:33:29.020 --> 00:33:34.460]   other third party write an app and then say, "Oh, hey, Apple, here's an app."
[00:33:34.460 --> 00:33:39.300]   These companies are too big and too intertwined that Google and Apple are having conversations
[00:33:39.300 --> 00:33:41.100]   at a higher level than that, right?
[00:33:41.100 --> 00:33:42.100]   Well, I think they have to have a conversation.
[00:33:42.100 --> 00:33:46.500]   I think that in fact, they may not have submitted a map to the store, but that doesn't mean
[00:33:46.500 --> 00:33:51.380]   that they aren't currently having conversations about what it would take to get a map on iPhone.
[00:33:51.380 --> 00:33:52.380]   Right?
[00:33:52.380 --> 00:33:57.460]   I would be shocked if they knew the date circled on the calendar when their agreement with
[00:33:57.460 --> 00:34:03.340]   Apple ends and they were not prepared with an app, at least built and ready to go so
[00:34:03.340 --> 00:34:06.900]   that if they wanted to deploy it on iOS, they could do so.
[00:34:06.900 --> 00:34:07.900]   I agree.
[00:34:07.900 --> 00:34:11.500]   That's a conversation with people that make me think that that is a real thing, as opposed
[00:34:11.500 --> 00:34:13.380]   to an idea that they're kicking around.
[00:34:13.380 --> 00:34:15.380]   They've got the app.
[00:34:15.380 --> 00:34:21.500]   I don't think Google is going to submit it to the app store and say, "Okay, this is
[00:34:21.500 --> 00:34:22.500]   how up to Apple."
[00:34:22.500 --> 00:34:27.420]   I think Google and Apple are having higher level conversations at this point.
[00:34:27.420 --> 00:34:29.700]   What are those conversations, Chris?
[00:34:29.700 --> 00:34:30.700]   What is Google asking for?
[00:34:30.700 --> 00:34:32.340]   What is Apple asking for?
[00:34:32.340 --> 00:34:39.900]   Well, I think that it's probably best for Google not to call this week and say, "Wow,
[00:34:39.900 --> 00:34:43.940]   how about that maps app, eh?"
[00:34:43.940 --> 00:34:46.100]   Might be rubbing a little salt in the wound.
[00:34:46.100 --> 00:34:47.300]   I think you want to wait.
[00:34:47.300 --> 00:34:52.300]   Another couple of weeks as things get better for the maps app and some of the scab is healed
[00:34:52.300 --> 00:34:54.940]   a little bit.
[00:34:54.940 --> 00:34:59.860]   Yeah, I think certainly they have the red phone there at Apple HQ and Google picks up
[00:34:59.860 --> 00:35:03.420]   their end and Apple picks up their end after the flunkies have dealt with each other and
[00:35:03.420 --> 00:35:08.540]   finally they say, "Okay, is this going to go or is this not going to go?"
[00:35:08.540 --> 00:35:11.780]   And then Apple says, "Okay, what we want from you is X.
[00:35:11.780 --> 00:35:14.260]   So we want some of your data, for example."
[00:35:14.260 --> 00:35:18.740]   And Google says, "Okay, but we want a prominent place on your store and we want to be able
[00:35:18.740 --> 00:35:23.940]   to use our stuff here and we don't want you knocking off X, Y and Z functionality because
[00:35:23.940 --> 00:35:26.260]   it competes with your maps app."
[00:35:26.260 --> 00:35:27.260]   I don't know.
[00:35:27.260 --> 00:35:31.700]   I think it is politically interesting because Apple certainly has the power to say, "No,
[00:35:31.700 --> 00:35:35.340]   you can't be on here, but then you're inviting the feds in, as you've said."
[00:35:35.340 --> 00:35:38.500]   So I don't know what each one of them wants.
[00:35:38.500 --> 00:35:44.260]   I think that Apple is still irritated with Google and far more than that.
[00:35:44.260 --> 00:35:46.900]   I think there's a time for them to let that go though.
[00:35:46.900 --> 00:35:52.300]   And I think one of the issues is that Apple has the situation where there's a lot of people
[00:35:52.300 --> 00:35:56.300]   really dependent on an application made by someone else who makes a competitive platform.
[00:35:56.300 --> 00:35:58.340]   And it's very easy for Google to continue.
[00:35:58.340 --> 00:36:01.980]   You can look at the trajectory and say, "Well, you could definitely see how Google
[00:36:01.980 --> 00:36:06.540]   maps could always work better on Android than they do on the iPhone."
[00:36:06.540 --> 00:36:11.900]   And that in the long term, Apple doesn't have control of its destiny in that area given
[00:36:11.900 --> 00:36:17.380]   that the company making that application is a direct competitor to that phone.
[00:36:17.380 --> 00:36:21.540]   Same reason Apple pulled the YouTube app and let YouTube, but they let Google put a YouTube
[00:36:21.540 --> 00:36:22.540]   app on there.
[00:36:22.540 --> 00:36:26.100]   They just want to be able to develop their own technology so that they can continue to
[00:36:26.100 --> 00:36:27.100]   compete.
[00:36:27.100 --> 00:36:29.780]   Now, the question is, "How long will it take them to catch up and how much will people
[00:36:29.780 --> 00:36:30.780]   care?"
[00:36:30.780 --> 00:36:35.260]   For the most part, people getting the right directions to where they're going is going
[00:36:35.260 --> 00:36:38.380]   to be the thing that is going to be the things they notice the most.
[00:36:38.380 --> 00:36:41.380]   Then the next thing is for them to go through and fix all those Dem files.
[00:36:41.380 --> 00:36:43.500]   The Dem files are the digital elevation maps.
[00:36:43.500 --> 00:36:45.940]   So you see those big clips that you're seeing.
[00:36:45.940 --> 00:36:49.340]   It's because the satellite takes those in squares.
[00:36:49.340 --> 00:36:52.860]   I used to make software that we used to make software that dealt with Dem files.
[00:36:52.860 --> 00:36:54.460]   This is in the 3D rendering.
[00:36:54.460 --> 00:36:57.060]   So what happens in the 3D rendering, you see all those big clips.
[00:36:57.060 --> 00:37:00.620]   And what happens is that the satellites take those images in squares.
[00:37:00.620 --> 00:37:04.100]   Those are USGS satellites and for the most part.
[00:37:04.100 --> 00:37:06.620]   And at the very edges, there's blend issues.
[00:37:06.620 --> 00:37:11.300]   And so what happened obviously was that someone didn't manage that very well.
[00:37:11.300 --> 00:37:15.980]   And so that you have to go through and really do a lot of work.
[00:37:15.980 --> 00:37:18.140]   There's actually one guy that they should just hire.
[00:37:18.140 --> 00:37:19.460]   It should just hire Mark Granger.
[00:37:19.460 --> 00:37:24.980]   The rumor is that they're actively taking contractors who worked on Google Maps, they're
[00:37:24.980 --> 00:37:25.980]   actively seeking them out.
[00:37:25.980 --> 00:37:29.460]   Well, to fix that 3D area, that's the one guy that probably knows more about it than
[00:37:29.460 --> 00:37:31.060]   anyone else in the world.
[00:37:31.060 --> 00:37:35.380]   And so anyway, but that's where you're seeing those clips.
[00:37:35.380 --> 00:37:38.580]   And that can be fixed pretty quickly.
[00:37:38.580 --> 00:37:42.500]   The harder part is getting the directions right, getting the transit right.
[00:37:42.500 --> 00:37:44.220]   And then Street View is, I don't know, when they--
[00:37:44.220 --> 00:37:48.340]   But as Chris pointed out, the 3D view is eye candy, not useful to anybody.
[00:37:48.340 --> 00:37:50.140]   I mean, this is pretty--
[00:37:50.140 --> 00:37:52.940]   Google does it, but I don't know how useful that is.
[00:37:52.940 --> 00:37:54.460]   I got to say that I disagree with that.
[00:37:54.460 --> 00:37:55.460]   I disagree with that.
[00:37:55.460 --> 00:37:56.460]   Exactly.
[00:37:56.460 --> 00:38:01.340]   Nothing can give you, as a pedestrian, or even as a driver, a better sense of the spatial
[00:38:01.340 --> 00:38:05.140]   relationships between this place you need to get to than being able to make that tour
[00:38:05.140 --> 00:38:06.140]   around.
[00:38:06.140 --> 00:38:10.180]   I mean, I've been to the Chicago Sun Times building several times, but only after spending
[00:38:10.180 --> 00:38:14.500]   20 minutes, essentially in a helicopter, being able to see that building from every angle
[00:38:14.500 --> 00:38:16.700]   that I really start to understand.
[00:38:16.700 --> 00:38:21.020]   Here is where it is in relationship to the merchandise mark.
[00:38:21.020 --> 00:38:24.020]   Here's where it is in relationship to the Sears Tower to Millennium Park.
[00:38:24.020 --> 00:38:26.020]   And that's better than the Street View capability.
[00:38:26.020 --> 00:38:29.180]   It's better.
[00:38:29.180 --> 00:38:34.180]   I think that the 3D view is better up until the point where you're within two blocks of
[00:38:34.180 --> 00:38:35.180]   the place.
[00:38:35.180 --> 00:38:36.180]   So for a 30--
[00:38:36.180 --> 00:38:38.980]   Literally 30,000 foot view, that's what you want.
[00:38:38.980 --> 00:38:44.500]   To get you to get you within a block or two of the place, I would be relying on 3D view.
[00:38:44.500 --> 00:38:48.100]   When it comes to that point where you need to know what door is this and if there are
[00:38:48.100 --> 00:38:51.780]   three doors, which one it is, obviously you would love to have Street View.
[00:38:51.780 --> 00:38:55.980]   And also Street View is also used for things like when I went to San Francisco, I was
[00:38:55.980 --> 00:38:58.380]   going before my plane even took off.
[00:38:58.380 --> 00:39:02.380]   I was touring that neighborhood Street by Street to see, "Okay, I can get lunch there
[00:39:02.380 --> 00:39:05.340]   or, "Okay, good, there's a post office right there where I can go."
[00:39:05.340 --> 00:39:10.060]   You just like to have that little boots on the ground, Intel, that only Street View can
[00:39:10.060 --> 00:39:11.060]   give you.
[00:39:11.060 --> 00:39:13.660]   It is a big loss not to have Street View available.
[00:39:13.660 --> 00:39:14.660]   But this is something.
[00:39:14.660 --> 00:39:16.100]   And by the way, Google's doing the same thing.
[00:39:16.100 --> 00:39:17.100]   Everybody's doing the same 3D.
[00:39:17.100 --> 00:39:19.860]   If actually it was no key, I think it started all this.
[00:39:19.860 --> 00:39:23.780]   This is the cliff thing you were talking about where you get these weird distortions in
[00:39:23.780 --> 00:39:24.780]   the buildings.
[00:39:24.780 --> 00:39:29.060]   Look at Bing Maps, which is Nokia.
[00:39:29.060 --> 00:39:30.340]   That's at a whole different level.
[00:39:30.340 --> 00:39:31.340]   So this is...
[00:39:31.340 --> 00:39:34.740]   I mean, if you look at this image, compare it to the...
[00:39:34.740 --> 00:39:35.740]   Oh, why?
[00:39:35.740 --> 00:39:36.740]   So you're saying the Nokia...
[00:39:36.740 --> 00:39:37.740]   Oh, yeah, it's much better.
[00:39:37.740 --> 00:39:38.940]   Way, way better.
[00:39:38.940 --> 00:39:39.940]   Yeah.
[00:39:39.940 --> 00:39:40.940]   I mean, it's...
[00:39:40.940 --> 00:39:41.940]   Now, the one thing that...
[00:39:41.940 --> 00:39:44.580]   And Nokia, by the way, bought Telenav.
[00:39:44.580 --> 00:39:49.900]   So they have their own built-in, very high-quality, nap mapping capabilities.
[00:39:49.900 --> 00:39:50.900]   Right.
[00:39:50.900 --> 00:39:54.780]   And I think basically, how are they going to leverage that for the new Lumia Windows phone?
[00:39:54.780 --> 00:39:55.780]   Exactly.
[00:39:55.780 --> 00:39:59.900]   Because I was with Windows 7.5 on the Lumia 900.
[00:39:59.900 --> 00:40:04.420]   I was already pretty impressed with not only how good the mapping were, but also how well
[00:40:04.420 --> 00:40:07.900]   it was integrated into anything that you needed map information for.
[00:40:07.900 --> 00:40:09.060]   They have naps are a navtech.
[00:40:09.060 --> 00:40:12.140]   I keep confusing Telenav and navtech.
[00:40:12.140 --> 00:40:15.940]   Navtech is Nokia's Telenav is Erickson's.
[00:40:15.940 --> 00:40:22.260]   But the point being that they have, like Google, they've been doing this for years, it's interesting.
[00:40:22.260 --> 00:40:24.140]   We talked about this on Twitter on Sunday.
[00:40:24.140 --> 00:40:29.500]   What it really was was the perception of these companies in a few years, what was going to
[00:40:29.500 --> 00:40:31.580]   be very important was mobile, was location.
[00:40:31.580 --> 00:40:32.580]   Right.
[00:40:32.580 --> 00:40:33.580]   And we need to be a player in here.
[00:40:33.580 --> 00:40:37.940]   And Apple's actually late to that game as they were with social as well.
[00:40:37.940 --> 00:40:39.980]   And they never figured social out.
[00:40:39.980 --> 00:40:41.700]   And I think it was the contention...
[00:40:41.700 --> 00:40:48.980]   I want to say Peter Rojas of Gadget who had that contention that Apple is...
[00:40:48.980 --> 00:40:52.060]   The difference is Apple's not a software company, they're a hardware company, they're
[00:40:52.060 --> 00:40:53.860]   a computer company.
[00:40:53.860 --> 00:41:01.020]   And so it's taken them a while to get the idea of mobile, of location, of social.
[00:41:01.020 --> 00:41:05.940]   Whereas a company like Google, which is essentially a services, web services company, it's a
[00:41:05.940 --> 00:41:07.780]   little bit more of their native tongue.
[00:41:07.780 --> 00:41:08.780]   Right.
[00:41:08.780 --> 00:41:13.260]   Well, and I think that if Apple wants to catch up in this area, if they decide to take the
[00:41:13.260 --> 00:41:15.860]   plunge, they're really going to have to invest in making those app.
[00:41:15.860 --> 00:41:18.420]   They're going to have to take some of that...
[00:41:18.420 --> 00:41:19.420]   Some of the kitty.
[00:41:19.420 --> 00:41:20.420]   It's really important.
[00:41:20.420 --> 00:41:26.220]   I mean, this is really for Apple, a five or $10 billion problem that they have to solve.
[00:41:26.220 --> 00:41:27.220]   It's a revenue problem.
[00:41:27.220 --> 00:41:29.380]   And they need to solve it quickly.
[00:41:29.380 --> 00:41:32.620]   And it sounds like that they're trying to hire just about anybody who's worked on maps
[00:41:32.620 --> 00:41:36.460]   in the past.
[00:41:36.460 --> 00:41:37.460]   But I think that they're going to have to...
[00:41:37.460 --> 00:41:40.700]   And there's a lot of places they could improve the maps to go past that.
[00:41:40.700 --> 00:41:43.020]   For instance, the street view is fine.
[00:41:43.020 --> 00:41:48.180]   The problem with the street view is that it is a lot of the stuff is old at this point.
[00:41:48.180 --> 00:41:53.860]   I went to try to get a sandwich in London and went to a place that was closed because
[00:41:53.860 --> 00:41:54.860]   it was gone.
[00:41:54.860 --> 00:41:55.860]   I mean, the street view was fine.
[00:41:55.860 --> 00:41:56.860]   And that's Google?
[00:41:56.860 --> 00:41:57.860]   Well, it's Google.
[00:41:57.860 --> 00:42:01.580]   I'm just saying that finding ways to update that faster and also really looking at doing...
[00:42:01.580 --> 00:42:04.980]   I think Google and Apple are relying on things like Yelp for that.
[00:42:04.980 --> 00:42:06.700]   Google has Google places.
[00:42:06.700 --> 00:42:09.460]   But what tends to happen for me is that I tend to...
[00:42:09.460 --> 00:42:13.140]   If I find the only time I use street view is I get to something that says there's a subway
[00:42:13.140 --> 00:42:14.140]   there, there's something else there.
[00:42:14.140 --> 00:42:18.100]   And then I go show me street view so I can actually see the store to make sure that that
[00:42:18.100 --> 00:42:22.260]   wasn't just an errant attachment to the map.
[00:42:22.260 --> 00:42:25.740]   That's the only time I ever use street view is to know what the store looks like or if
[00:42:25.740 --> 00:42:26.740]   it really is there.
[00:42:26.740 --> 00:42:30.980]   And to emphasize this, this is more than just another app on the phone.
[00:42:30.980 --> 00:42:32.620]   Yeah, it's like the app that almost...
[00:42:32.620 --> 00:42:33.780]   Use probably more than any other app.
[00:42:33.780 --> 00:42:37.620]   And it's a huge amount of revenue potential for it.
[00:42:37.620 --> 00:42:40.980]   It's a very important thing for these companies.
[00:42:40.980 --> 00:42:46.540]   And so Apple, it seems under-est just as they did with Ping, under-estimated the importance
[00:42:46.540 --> 00:42:49.460]   and the difficulty of doing it.
[00:42:49.460 --> 00:42:51.580]   Were they premature employing the plug on Google Maps?
[00:42:51.580 --> 00:42:53.380]   Should they have waited another iteration?
[00:42:53.380 --> 00:42:56.420]   They should have had them both coexist for a while before they drop them.
[00:42:56.420 --> 00:42:57.420]   But they need...
[00:42:57.420 --> 00:43:01.700]   And they're getting, and Andy to your point, they're getting obviously from users the
[00:43:01.700 --> 00:43:02.700]   corrections.
[00:43:02.700 --> 00:43:07.860]   If they get everybody who uses an iPhone to enter these corrections in, maybe they'll
[00:43:07.860 --> 00:43:09.580]   get better faster, right?
[00:43:09.580 --> 00:43:10.540]   Apple has a hundred-
[00:43:10.540 --> 00:43:11.540]   How is that my job?
[00:43:11.540 --> 00:43:12.540]   Exactly.
[00:43:12.540 --> 00:43:15.340]   I mean, you've got a hundred billion dollars.
[00:43:15.340 --> 00:43:16.340]   Give me...
[00:43:16.340 --> 00:43:18.580]   Actually, I'm not even really joking here.
[00:43:18.580 --> 00:43:22.700]   When I say that, wouldn't it be great if they simply put a bounty on, we will give you
[00:43:22.700 --> 00:43:24.860]   one free song for every five years.
[00:43:24.860 --> 00:43:25.860]   There you go.
[00:43:25.860 --> 00:43:28.420]   Accepted sections that you make for our maps.
[00:43:28.420 --> 00:43:33.060]   There would be people who would actually be driving around trying to earn the new Kylo
[00:43:33.060 --> 00:43:34.060]   Minojel.
[00:43:34.060 --> 00:43:35.060]   So here's the...
[00:43:35.060 --> 00:43:42.140]   If you're looking at the iOS 6 Maps application for Apple, when you press up the little page
[00:43:42.140 --> 00:43:46.580]   turn thing, it's hard to see, but it says data from TomTom and others.
[00:43:46.580 --> 00:43:49.580]   By the way, TomTom was very quick to say, "Hey, our map apps works fine."
[00:43:49.580 --> 00:43:51.300]   It's not our fault.
[00:43:51.300 --> 00:43:52.980]   And then in a little fine print, right?
[00:43:52.980 --> 00:43:55.620]   Whoops, I pressed the wrong button right above the printer button.
[00:43:55.620 --> 00:43:56.820]   It says, "Report a problem."
[00:43:56.820 --> 00:44:01.940]   And you can search results are incorrect, street or other is incorrect, location is missing,
[00:44:01.940 --> 00:44:04.500]   problem with satellite image, my problem isn't listed.
[00:44:04.500 --> 00:44:08.140]   And they invite you to do this.
[00:44:08.140 --> 00:44:09.140]   But you...
[00:44:09.140 --> 00:44:11.340]   So create a poor sap on the other side of that.
[00:44:11.340 --> 00:44:13.580]   It's like they're getting like 10,000 of those.
[00:44:13.580 --> 00:44:15.700]   I know, I know, I know.
[00:44:15.700 --> 00:44:19.780]   This isn't an emergency room and I'm still bleeding, please send an ambulance.
[00:44:19.780 --> 00:44:26.180]   Yeah, as these problems emerged over the weekend, people would post about it and you'd hear
[00:44:26.180 --> 00:44:29.740]   people saying, "Well, you just have to keep using it to help Apple."
[00:44:29.740 --> 00:44:30.740]   It's not my job.
[00:44:30.740 --> 00:44:33.980]   My job is for them to give me a working product.
[00:44:33.980 --> 00:44:37.860]   And so that I mean, I don't get a refrigerator and then say, "Oh, by the way, it doesn't make
[00:44:37.860 --> 00:44:38.860]   ice.
[00:44:38.860 --> 00:44:41.740]   Let me keep reporting this problem until you figure out what's wrong with it."
[00:44:41.740 --> 00:44:44.100]   I should get a functional.
[00:44:44.100 --> 00:44:45.100]   That's a good point.
[00:44:45.100 --> 00:44:46.100]   You know, so...
[00:44:46.100 --> 00:44:47.740]   We did pay a lot for this.
[00:44:47.740 --> 00:44:50.300]   I paid a lot for this thing and I expected to work.
[00:44:50.300 --> 00:44:51.300]   Well, and Apple's...
[00:44:51.300 --> 00:44:53.580]   Apple tagline is, "It just works."
[00:44:53.580 --> 00:44:54.580]   It just doesn't work.
[00:44:54.580 --> 00:44:55.580]   It just doesn't work.
[00:44:55.580 --> 00:44:58.100]   I think they forgot to put badly in parentheses.
[00:44:58.100 --> 00:45:00.140]   The three parties here are Apple.
[00:45:00.140 --> 00:45:02.140]   Apple probably...
[00:45:02.140 --> 00:45:06.620]   They've indicated what they want is for you to use their maps and make it better.
[00:45:06.620 --> 00:45:07.620]   There's Google.
[00:45:07.620 --> 00:45:09.100]   Google has some interesting motivations here.
[00:45:09.100 --> 00:45:12.780]   On the one hand, I think they'd love for this to continue because Android look better,
[00:45:12.780 --> 00:45:14.580]   makes Google look better.
[00:45:14.580 --> 00:45:17.020]   And then there's the consumers, us.
[00:45:17.020 --> 00:45:19.220]   I think we want Google Maps back, right?
[00:45:19.220 --> 00:45:22.060]   I mean, isn't that what we want or no?
[00:45:22.060 --> 00:45:23.060]   Not necessarily.
[00:45:23.060 --> 00:45:25.020]   We want something that works as well as Google Maps.
[00:45:25.020 --> 00:45:27.180]   That might not necessarily be the exact same product.
[00:45:27.180 --> 00:45:30.100]   I think that we really have to revisit this in six months' time.
[00:45:30.100 --> 00:45:34.260]   In six months' time, if it's working great and it does everything, the old, app did,
[00:45:34.260 --> 00:45:38.020]   and more, no one will remember how much trouble came up in the first three weeks.
[00:45:38.020 --> 00:45:39.020]   Okay.
[00:45:39.020 --> 00:45:40.020]   I think that's true.
[00:45:40.020 --> 00:45:41.860]   I just think that Apple is going to really have to double down.
[00:45:41.860 --> 00:45:43.100]   They either have to put the Google...
[00:45:43.100 --> 00:45:46.100]   In the next three months, I would say three months, they either have to put the Google
[00:45:46.100 --> 00:45:49.300]   map back on the phone or they need to have this really working.
[00:45:49.300 --> 00:45:51.500]   And they're going to have to do whatever they have to do to make that happen.
[00:45:51.500 --> 00:45:53.500]   And I think that that's the issue.
[00:45:53.500 --> 00:45:57.140]   You think that they're going to invite 100 different bloggers and journalists to visit
[00:45:57.140 --> 00:45:59.620]   the super top secret Apple Maps lab?
[00:45:59.620 --> 00:46:02.140]   You get a rhyme that can help talk to them.
[00:46:02.140 --> 00:46:05.020]   You can see exactly how much work goes into the maps that I like that have been...
[00:46:05.020 --> 00:46:06.180]   Google has done that.
[00:46:06.180 --> 00:46:09.700]   In fact, they knew that this was going to come up because a week before the iPhone 5
[00:46:09.700 --> 00:46:14.740]   came out, they put out an article that said, "We have 400 years of mapping experience."
[00:46:14.740 --> 00:46:17.180]   I don't know where that comes from.
[00:46:17.180 --> 00:46:23.460]   And they pulled the curtain back on the secret mapping, world headquarters building and showed
[00:46:23.460 --> 00:46:24.460]   how many...
[00:46:24.460 --> 00:46:26.900]   I mean, Google's known this is going to happen.
[00:46:26.900 --> 00:46:32.060]   And Google has been spinning like crazy for the last three weeks, preparing for this.
[00:46:32.060 --> 00:46:33.380]   Look how much work we put into it.
[00:46:33.380 --> 00:46:35.540]   Now Nokia's doing the same thing.
[00:46:35.540 --> 00:46:36.540]   Everybody's piling on.
[00:46:36.540 --> 00:46:41.980]   You're making them sound like these friends who knows that their friend of the horse is
[00:46:41.980 --> 00:46:43.820]   not going to make it off that skateboard ramp.
[00:46:43.820 --> 00:46:45.780]   They're going to hit themselves right in the...
[00:46:45.780 --> 00:46:46.780]   I taught you.
[00:46:46.780 --> 00:46:49.140]   And all they're doing is saying, "No, no, totally.
[00:46:49.140 --> 00:46:50.140]   You're going to totally make that hangover."
[00:46:50.140 --> 00:46:55.140]   Yeah, Apple.
[00:46:55.140 --> 00:46:58.140]   Oh, yeah.
[00:46:58.140 --> 00:46:59.140]   Maps.
[00:46:59.140 --> 00:47:00.140]   Easy.
[00:47:00.140 --> 00:47:01.140]   Easy.
[00:47:01.140 --> 00:47:02.140]   You're going.
[00:47:02.140 --> 00:47:03.140]   No, you're probably going.
[00:47:03.140 --> 00:47:04.140]   I'm going.
[00:47:04.140 --> 00:47:05.140]   Do it again.
[00:47:05.140 --> 00:47:06.140]   Do it again.
[00:47:06.140 --> 00:47:10.940]   I mean, I do understand why Apple's doing what they're doing.
[00:47:10.940 --> 00:47:13.140]   They just have to solve this.
[00:47:13.140 --> 00:47:14.140]   I mean, they just have to solve this really.
[00:47:14.140 --> 00:47:17.140]   But I'm actually surprised that they seem to be scrambling now before...
[00:47:17.140 --> 00:47:18.140]   Oh, no.
[00:47:18.140 --> 00:47:19.140]   Remember and Tenegate.
[00:47:19.140 --> 00:47:21.140]   Remember, I mean, this is not...
[00:47:21.140 --> 00:47:23.860]   I mean, people have this notion that Apple makes no mistake.
[00:47:23.860 --> 00:47:25.860]   But this is the worst.
[00:47:25.860 --> 00:47:26.860]   This is...
[00:47:26.860 --> 00:47:30.140]   I think this is the worst flaw of any iPhone ever.
[00:47:30.140 --> 00:47:31.140]   Really?
[00:47:31.140 --> 00:47:32.500]   Because people use it so often.
[00:47:32.500 --> 00:47:36.140]   I mean, my phone hanging up every once in a while when I hold it the wrong way doesn't
[00:47:36.140 --> 00:47:37.140]   really bother me.
[00:47:37.140 --> 00:47:38.140]   I just...
[00:47:38.140 --> 00:47:39.140]   But the thing is, is that now...
[00:47:39.140 --> 00:47:40.700]   And it's because they took the other one away.
[00:47:40.700 --> 00:47:43.340]   I think that's the issue is that when you take it, suddenly everybody's like...
[00:47:43.340 --> 00:47:45.580]   You know what I think the worst mistake is?
[00:47:45.580 --> 00:47:47.340]   I hate this freaking connector.
[00:47:47.340 --> 00:47:49.340]   I hate this thing.
[00:47:49.340 --> 00:47:55.820]   I had to go out and buy $60 worth of cables because, you know, I'm used to having 30-pin
[00:47:55.820 --> 00:47:56.820]   cables everywhere.
[00:47:56.820 --> 00:47:58.060]   So I can charge anywhere.
[00:47:58.060 --> 00:48:00.380]   We got 30-pin cables coming out of this table.
[00:48:00.380 --> 00:48:02.260]   They actually pop out of the table.
[00:48:02.260 --> 00:48:06.100]   And I had to go buy because I only...
[00:48:06.100 --> 00:48:08.540]   I think I have one way to charge his phone in my hole.
[00:48:08.540 --> 00:48:11.220]   In the whole world, I have one way...
[00:48:11.220 --> 00:48:15.460]   Because you know, when you lose an Apple, a 30-pin cable, you just go ask a friend.
[00:48:15.460 --> 00:48:16.460]   And I...
[00:48:16.460 --> 00:48:17.460]   I got one way.
[00:48:17.460 --> 00:48:19.700]   Well, it's the same problem with that.
[00:48:19.700 --> 00:48:22.220]   Same thing with that little adapter for the retina.
[00:48:22.220 --> 00:48:27.820]   So I literally had to spend their $20 each, $60 so I'd have a cable in my car, cable at
[00:48:27.820 --> 00:48:32.220]   the office, and an extra cable because it makes me, for my laptop case, because I'm...
[00:48:32.220 --> 00:48:33.220]   Makes me nervous.
[00:48:33.220 --> 00:48:36.060]   I just think if they were going to change it, they should have just gone to a mini or a
[00:48:36.060 --> 00:48:37.060]   micro...
[00:48:37.060 --> 00:48:39.620]   Well, they have apparently good reasons for not doing that.
[00:48:39.620 --> 00:48:40.620]   Good reasons for bandwidth.
[00:48:40.620 --> 00:48:41.620]   I don't know.
[00:48:41.620 --> 00:48:42.620]   But...
[00:48:42.620 --> 00:48:45.820]   Now, when we're going to take a break, because I do want to ask Chris Breen, because I've
[00:48:45.820 --> 00:48:51.180]   asked him to do the research, to tell us what the hell this thing does and doesn't do,
[00:48:51.180 --> 00:48:53.060]   this lightning thing.
[00:48:53.060 --> 00:48:56.100]   And where the hell are my adapters so that I can use my docs?
[00:48:56.100 --> 00:48:59.420]   And if I use my docs, will I be able to do what I was able to do before?
[00:48:59.420 --> 00:49:07.340]   My Sono stock, my Renew Clock, my Mercedes-Benz dock, my BMW dock, my Bentley dock, and my
[00:49:07.340 --> 00:49:08.420]   Rolls Royce dock.
[00:49:08.420 --> 00:49:09.420]   What am I gonna...
[00:49:09.420 --> 00:49:11.940]   And has the headphone jack driving you crazy yet?
[00:49:11.940 --> 00:49:14.740]   Well, it's weird that it comes out of the bottom.
[00:49:14.740 --> 00:49:16.980]   But that's life, right?
[00:49:16.980 --> 00:49:17.980]   I like that.
[00:49:17.980 --> 00:49:18.980]   You like that.
[00:49:18.980 --> 00:49:19.980]   See, I don't like it.
[00:49:19.980 --> 00:49:24.420]   Here's why, because I sit in the car, I put it in the cup holder, and I don't want the
[00:49:24.420 --> 00:49:25.980]   screen to be upside down.
[00:49:25.980 --> 00:49:28.500]   That's a little weird, NANL.
[00:49:28.500 --> 00:49:31.260]   But I don't want the screen to be upside down, but I have to, because otherwise it's
[00:49:31.260 --> 00:49:34.020]   sitting on the headphone connector.
[00:49:34.020 --> 00:49:35.020]   And there's...
[00:49:35.020 --> 00:49:37.100]   That's a little weird in there.
[00:49:37.100 --> 00:49:38.580]   I'm a little weird NANL.
[00:49:38.580 --> 00:49:42.100]   And then, and there seems to be like there's room here that they could have put it there.
[00:49:42.100 --> 00:49:43.100]   I don't know.
[00:49:43.100 --> 00:49:44.100]   There is room.
[00:49:44.100 --> 00:49:45.460]   Maybe not on the inside.
[00:49:45.460 --> 00:49:46.660]   Maybe not on the inside, I guess.
[00:49:46.660 --> 00:49:47.660]   Anyway, we're gonna take a break.
[00:49:47.660 --> 00:49:52.460]   Chris Breen is going to give us the lowdown on Layton when we come back.
[00:49:52.460 --> 00:49:55.220]   This isn't a bitch fest.
[00:49:55.220 --> 00:49:57.620]   We will also talk about the good stuff about iOS 5.
[00:49:57.620 --> 00:49:59.340]   And everyone thought we were fanboys.
[00:49:59.340 --> 00:50:00.340]   And it's over.
[00:50:00.340 --> 00:50:03.660]   No, and I have put aside all others.
[00:50:03.660 --> 00:50:08.220]   I have forsaken all others and committed for at least a couple of weeks, which is my average
[00:50:08.220 --> 00:50:12.180]   for girlfriends too, to this phone.
[00:50:12.180 --> 00:50:14.780]   Because I want to give it every benefit of the doubt.
[00:50:14.780 --> 00:50:15.940]   And I am enjoying using it.
[00:50:15.940 --> 00:50:18.620]   You know where you really like it?
[00:50:18.620 --> 00:50:20.660]   It's beautiful.
[00:50:20.660 --> 00:50:22.860]   It feels nice in the hand.
[00:50:22.860 --> 00:50:24.260]   It feels like a work of art.
[00:50:24.260 --> 00:50:27.940]   It gets back to that whole situation where your phone is state of the art until they release
[00:50:27.940 --> 00:50:28.940]   another one.
[00:50:28.940 --> 00:50:30.340]   This is not state of the art.
[00:50:30.340 --> 00:50:31.860]   This is far from state of the art.
[00:50:31.860 --> 00:50:34.180]   When I go, I just...
[00:50:34.180 --> 00:50:40.940]   I rooted and put cyanogen mod CM10 on my Galaxy Nexus 3 so I'd have Jelly Bean on it.
[00:50:40.940 --> 00:50:42.780]   This is not even close to state of the art.
[00:50:42.780 --> 00:50:45.180]   There's so many things that I can do better.
[00:50:45.180 --> 00:50:47.660]   But it's beautiful.
[00:50:47.660 --> 00:50:49.780]   And you cannot say that about any Android phone.
[00:50:49.780 --> 00:50:53.940]   You cannot say, "Ooh, this could be in the Museum of Modern Art.
[00:50:53.940 --> 00:50:55.940]   This is so pretty."
[00:50:55.940 --> 00:50:56.940]   It feels so.
[00:50:56.940 --> 00:50:58.740]   It's just as beautiful as my iPhone 4.
[00:50:58.740 --> 00:50:59.740]   That's hideous.
[00:50:59.740 --> 00:51:01.420]   What the hell you put that case on there for?
[00:51:01.420 --> 00:51:02.420]   You're sacrilege.
[00:51:02.420 --> 00:51:03.420]   Exactly.
[00:51:03.420 --> 00:51:06.420]   It is legitimately beautiful.
[00:51:06.420 --> 00:51:10.900]   But I've been really trying to keep my eyes peeled for how people use it.
[00:51:10.900 --> 00:51:12.140]   They use their iPhones in the wild.
[00:51:12.140 --> 00:51:15.540]   And I almost never see people using something without a case on it.
[00:51:15.540 --> 00:51:19.100]   It's going to look great for a couple weeks until they get that shipment in from Amazon.
[00:51:19.100 --> 00:51:22.300]   And then it's going to have a purple Hello Kitty rubber skin on it.
[00:51:22.300 --> 00:51:25.060]   And then you might as well get an Android phone if you're going to do that.
[00:51:25.060 --> 00:51:26.060]   If you put an ugly...
[00:51:26.060 --> 00:51:28.100]   I've got to get an ass case on this work.
[00:51:28.100 --> 00:51:30.340]   If you want an ugly phone, go for Android.
[00:51:30.340 --> 00:51:35.540]   That's an endorsement from Leo.
[00:51:35.540 --> 00:51:37.860]   I'm going through a little Galaxy S3 withdrawal.
[00:51:37.860 --> 00:51:38.860]   That's really what's going on.
[00:51:38.860 --> 00:51:39.860]   I fear my little janky.
[00:51:39.860 --> 00:51:40.860]   That's why.
[00:51:40.860 --> 00:51:42.940]   All right, I'll be okay.
[00:51:42.940 --> 00:51:47.700]   You know, if you want to get an iPhone 5, you probably should get rid of your iPhone 4S.
[00:51:47.700 --> 00:51:50.140]   Have you gone to Gazelle yet and gotten a quote?
[00:51:50.140 --> 00:51:51.140]   I should.
[00:51:51.140 --> 00:51:52.140]   You should.
[00:51:52.140 --> 00:51:54.140]   Tell me a little bit about your 4S.
[00:51:54.140 --> 00:51:56.060]   Yeah, 4S from which carrier?
[00:51:56.060 --> 00:51:57.060]   AT&T.
[00:51:57.060 --> 00:51:58.060]   Right.
[00:51:58.060 --> 00:51:59.060]   AT&T.
[00:51:59.060 --> 00:52:00.060]   Yeah.
[00:52:00.060 --> 00:52:01.060]   And is it the 816-64?
[00:52:01.060 --> 00:52:02.060]   64.
[00:52:02.060 --> 00:52:03.060]   That's all I get.
[00:52:03.060 --> 00:52:04.060]   Is that how you roll?
[00:52:04.060 --> 00:52:05.060]   That's how I roll.
[00:52:05.060 --> 00:52:06.060]   250.
[00:52:06.060 --> 00:52:07.060]   I'm going to assume it's not flawless.
[00:52:07.060 --> 00:52:08.060]   It's good.
[00:52:08.060 --> 00:52:09.060]   Flawless.
[00:52:09.060 --> 00:52:10.060]   It's 256.
[00:52:10.060 --> 00:52:11.940]   It's $250.
[00:52:11.940 --> 00:52:13.300]   That's it.
[00:52:13.300 --> 00:52:14.300]   Put that in a box.
[00:52:14.300 --> 00:52:15.620]   They pay the postage.
[00:52:15.620 --> 00:52:17.900]   You get a check and this is guaranteed for 30 days.
[00:52:17.900 --> 00:52:20.780]   So go ahead and get those quotes right now.
[00:52:20.780 --> 00:52:24.260]   By the way, they wipe the data for you.
[00:52:24.260 --> 00:52:26.980]   You don't have to sell it and do all that stuff.
[00:52:26.980 --> 00:52:28.180]   They do it all for you all.
[00:52:28.180 --> 00:52:30.220]   Really, it's bad as simple as you can get.
[00:52:30.220 --> 00:52:34.620]   Get a box and then go through some other stuff, maybe some other old phones lying around.
[00:52:34.620 --> 00:52:36.860]   They take any iPhone.
[00:52:36.860 --> 00:52:44.380]   They'll also take Samsung galaxies if you have one of them lying around.
[00:52:44.380 --> 00:52:49.260]   They're all iPads, iPods, Blackberries, MacBooks and iMacs.
[00:52:49.260 --> 00:52:52.540]   They have traded now 1 million gadgets.
[00:52:52.540 --> 00:52:56.340]   They've set out millions in dollars in payments.
[00:52:56.340 --> 00:52:57.660]   It is a great service.
[00:52:57.660 --> 00:53:02.060]   G-A-Z, $50 million in payments to over 300,000 customers.
[00:53:02.060 --> 00:53:03.060]   G-A-Z.
[00:53:03.060 --> 00:53:04.060]   We've been talking about gazillion.
[00:53:04.060 --> 00:53:06.020]   You've seen our basement.
[00:53:06.020 --> 00:53:07.860]   Would you please our basement?
[00:53:07.860 --> 00:53:08.860]   We share a basement.
[00:53:08.860 --> 00:53:11.940]   Would you please gazelle some of that crap?
[00:53:11.940 --> 00:53:13.540]   We need to go to gazelle table.
[00:53:13.540 --> 00:53:16.420]   You've got $10,000 worth of stuff down there.
[00:53:16.420 --> 00:53:17.420]   $10,000.
[00:53:17.420 --> 00:53:18.420]   Hundreds of thousands.
[00:53:18.420 --> 00:53:20.900]   You know, Alex Pies, everything.
[00:53:20.900 --> 00:53:21.900]   I've never seen.
[00:53:21.900 --> 00:53:26.780]   We get more Amazon boxes every morning and it's depressing to me because I come in and
[00:53:26.780 --> 00:53:27.780]   there's a pile of boxes.
[00:53:27.780 --> 00:53:28.780]   Oh, anything for me?
[00:53:28.780 --> 00:53:29.780]   They go, no, it's for Pixelcore.
[00:53:29.780 --> 00:53:31.780]   This is not the Amazon boxes you have to worry about.
[00:53:31.780 --> 00:53:32.780]   It's the B&H boxes.
[00:53:32.780 --> 00:53:33.780]   Those are expensive.
[00:53:33.780 --> 00:53:34.780]   Yeah.
[00:53:34.780 --> 00:53:39.460]   If you've got, if you're like Alex here and you've got a basement full of stuff, sell
[00:53:39.460 --> 00:53:42.300]   it, get some money, you can get a check of course.
[00:53:42.300 --> 00:53:45.900]   They'll give you PayPal if you prefer that or, and I recommend this if you're an Amazon
[00:53:45.900 --> 00:53:50.780]   buyer, get an Amazon gift card because you get 5% more.
[00:53:50.780 --> 00:53:52.260]   And so I buy everything on Amazon.
[00:53:52.260 --> 00:53:54.340]   So that's a great deal for me.
[00:53:54.340 --> 00:53:55.340]   G-A-Z.
[00:53:55.340 --> 00:53:58.180]   G-A-Z-E-L-L-E.com.
[00:53:58.180 --> 00:54:01.180]   Please don't let those old phones lie around.
[00:54:01.180 --> 00:54:02.620]   Somebody wants them.
[00:54:02.620 --> 00:54:05.180]   They'll give you money fast.
[00:54:05.180 --> 00:54:07.140]   Recycle the easy way with Gazelle.
[00:54:07.140 --> 00:54:14.220]   What are we going to talk about?
[00:54:14.220 --> 00:54:15.220]   Has anybody had any strategy?
[00:54:15.220 --> 00:54:19.540]   We're going to ask Chris about lightning connectors.
[00:54:19.540 --> 00:54:26.020]   So Chris, I know Dan Frakes got the, got this straight scoop from Apple itself at Backworld
[00:54:26.020 --> 00:54:27.020]   magazine.
[00:54:27.020 --> 00:54:28.700]   He did.
[00:54:28.700 --> 00:54:29.700]   There has been confusion.
[00:54:29.700 --> 00:54:32.900]   And Apple apparently is a little confused about what his lightning port will do.
[00:54:32.900 --> 00:54:34.700]   First of all, it is not faster.
[00:54:34.700 --> 00:54:35.700]   It's USB 2.
[00:54:35.700 --> 00:54:37.660]   It's the same speed as the old.
[00:54:37.660 --> 00:54:38.660]   Which is a light.
[00:54:38.660 --> 00:54:39.660]   That's disappointing.
[00:54:39.660 --> 00:54:43.060]   Well what people are suggesting is it's not the lightning technology itself but it's rather
[00:54:43.060 --> 00:54:47.860]   something in the devices so that it could be faster but it just currently isn't.
[00:54:47.860 --> 00:54:52.860]   So it's running at USB 2 speeds when you're using the current generation of devices.
[00:54:52.860 --> 00:54:56.100]   It's an 8-pin connector instead of 30-pin.
[00:54:56.100 --> 00:55:00.660]   Apple claims that it will make for a sturdier connector because you have less space than
[00:55:00.660 --> 00:55:01.660]   you would have.
[00:55:01.660 --> 00:55:02.660]   I will agree with that.
[00:55:02.660 --> 00:55:06.460]   I like the feeling when it goes in there it's solid and it's reversible which is great.
[00:55:06.460 --> 00:55:09.460]   And the 30-pin was really, I mean, we broke a lot.
[00:55:09.460 --> 00:55:11.780]   It's easy to break those because they have those little notches.
[00:55:11.780 --> 00:55:12.780]   This feels as solid in there.
[00:55:12.780 --> 00:55:17.580]   I have to say I am tempted to pull the wire because it's such a little connector and I
[00:55:17.580 --> 00:55:20.980]   know that many people will end up pulling out the wires on those.
[00:55:20.980 --> 00:55:23.220]   So, you know, that's one negative but that's okay.
[00:55:23.220 --> 00:55:24.220]   That's fine.
[00:55:24.220 --> 00:55:25.220]   It doesn't fall out.
[00:55:25.220 --> 00:55:26.220]   Right.
[00:55:26.220 --> 00:55:33.540]   So if you've got a, if you have a lot of 30-pin accessories as we all do, Apple will sell
[00:55:33.540 --> 00:55:38.700]   you for just $29, a 30-pin to lightning adapter.
[00:55:38.700 --> 00:55:40.540]   But you can't get those till October.
[00:55:40.540 --> 00:55:41.540]   Right.
[00:55:41.540 --> 00:55:43.700]   And it's about, it looks like it's about yay big.
[00:55:43.700 --> 00:55:45.100]   Well, there's two.
[00:55:45.100 --> 00:55:48.380]   There's one that's yay big and then there's one with a cable.
[00:55:48.380 --> 00:55:49.380]   Right.
[00:55:49.380 --> 00:55:50.380]   Then there's the one with a cable.
[00:55:50.380 --> 00:55:53.820]   Which is what I need for a dock because I'm not going to, I'm not going to, you know,
[00:55:53.820 --> 00:55:56.020]   make a tower, leaning tower in my dock.
[00:55:56.020 --> 00:55:57.020]   Exactly.
[00:55:57.020 --> 00:55:58.020]   Yeah.
[00:55:58.020 --> 00:55:59.660]   Because you're going to put pressure on the circuitry on the inside of the device.
[00:55:59.660 --> 00:56:00.660]   Right.
[00:56:00.660 --> 00:56:03.860]   So in that case, you want to get the cable instead of the adapter.
[00:56:03.860 --> 00:56:07.300]   And so I can imagine some people are going to buy one adapter and just lug it around
[00:56:07.300 --> 00:56:10.060]   with them where they need to go depending on how many accessories they have.
[00:56:10.060 --> 00:56:13.700]   But I think for a lot of us, we're going to end up buying four or five of these things.
[00:56:13.700 --> 00:56:16.940]   I'm going to spend more on cables and adapters than I spend on the iPhone.
[00:56:16.940 --> 00:56:18.860]   I think, yeah, like you, I have a Sonos device.
[00:56:18.860 --> 00:56:21.620]   I have a Sonos system and I use my devices with that.
[00:56:21.620 --> 00:56:22.620]   So that's one adapter.
[00:56:22.620 --> 00:56:24.100]   I need something for the car.
[00:56:24.100 --> 00:56:25.340]   So that's going to be another one.
[00:56:25.340 --> 00:56:26.900]   I have something else in the bedroom.
[00:56:26.900 --> 00:56:27.980]   So that's yet another one.
[00:56:27.980 --> 00:56:30.860]   So, you know, looking at three or four for me.
[00:56:30.860 --> 00:56:36.180]   Initially, when this came out, Apple said, oh, video, no, doesn't do video.
[00:56:36.180 --> 00:56:37.180]   Well, it turns out it does.
[00:56:37.180 --> 00:56:41.700]   And that's what Dan Frakes discovered is that Apple will be selling in the next few
[00:56:41.700 --> 00:56:42.700]   months.
[00:56:42.700 --> 00:56:46.060]   They haven't said exactly when that will happen is they will offer two different dongles.
[00:56:46.060 --> 00:56:49.620]   And one of them will do to VGA from your device.
[00:56:49.620 --> 00:56:50.940]   So the other one will do HDMI.
[00:56:50.940 --> 00:56:53.820]   So you get both audio and video out of it.
[00:56:53.820 --> 00:56:55.980]   But it seemed like it sort of caught Apple by surprise.
[00:56:55.980 --> 00:56:58.420]   As you said, initially, they said, no, no, no, it doesn't do that.
[00:56:58.420 --> 00:56:59.420]   The page was wrong.
[00:56:59.420 --> 00:57:01.060]   Yeah, the page was wrong.
[00:57:01.060 --> 00:57:02.580]   And they just said, well, just use AirPlay.
[00:57:02.580 --> 00:57:05.020]   Well, that's not always the perfect solution.
[00:57:05.020 --> 00:57:06.980]   So what else have you got this?
[00:57:06.980 --> 00:57:07.980]   Oh, yeah, yeah.
[00:57:07.980 --> 00:57:09.620]   Well, actually we're coming up with an adapter that will do that.
[00:57:09.620 --> 00:57:12.220]   So the technology is there.
[00:57:12.220 --> 00:57:15.500]   It's just that they have an implemented at this point.
[00:57:15.500 --> 00:57:19.020]   And then the question for me, and you too, so you have a Sonos Doc.
[00:57:19.020 --> 00:57:24.020]   So what we do when we get when I used to do what I got home and as I dock my iPhone 4
[00:57:24.020 --> 00:57:28.500]   into that Doc 30 pin connector, and then I could use the Sonos software and control
[00:57:28.500 --> 00:57:29.660]   it.
[00:57:29.660 --> 00:57:31.140]   I could see what was on there.
[00:57:31.140 --> 00:57:33.020]   I could play stuff from it.
[00:57:33.020 --> 00:57:35.180]   It had they call that iPod out, right?
[00:57:35.180 --> 00:57:41.700]   The ability to see and control it as if you are actually controlling the iPod directly.
[00:57:41.700 --> 00:57:44.300]   Does this have it or not?
[00:57:44.300 --> 00:57:45.500]   I honestly don't know.
[00:57:45.500 --> 00:57:47.500]   Apple hasn't said a thing about it.
[00:57:47.500 --> 00:57:48.500]   Yeah.
[00:57:48.500 --> 00:57:53.500]   I asked Apple and they said that in terms of iPod controls, playback controls that that
[00:57:53.500 --> 00:57:55.460]   is supported through the connector and through the doc.
[00:57:55.460 --> 00:57:56.460]   Oh, great.
[00:57:56.460 --> 00:57:57.460]   Excuse me.
[00:57:57.460 --> 00:57:59.380]   You know, my guess is it's not as complete.
[00:57:59.380 --> 00:58:03.860]   So for instance, I could, I used to be able, I should try it on my Mustang actually, connect
[00:58:03.860 --> 00:58:05.900]   this and then see the playlist.
[00:58:05.900 --> 00:58:08.940]   Like I could see the contents of it.
[00:58:08.940 --> 00:58:10.460]   That's that's a different issue.
[00:58:10.460 --> 00:58:12.540]   I got I got that may not be there.
[00:58:12.540 --> 00:58:15.220]   I got a specific answer to the question about playback controls.
[00:58:15.220 --> 00:58:17.220]   I'm almost told that yes playback controls do work.
[00:58:17.220 --> 00:58:18.220]   That's good.
[00:58:18.220 --> 00:58:19.220]   It's been in data though.
[00:58:19.220 --> 00:58:20.220]   Okay.
[00:58:20.220 --> 00:58:23.660]   So maybe that's the issue is that it's kind of half iPod out.
[00:58:23.660 --> 00:58:28.820]   But you know, at least if I could press pause and play on my Sonos software, that would
[00:58:28.820 --> 00:58:29.820]   be good.
[00:58:29.820 --> 00:58:31.140]   It'd be nice.
[00:58:31.140 --> 00:58:35.060]   You know, what I did was I would pick the audible book that I was listening to and I
[00:58:35.060 --> 00:58:40.660]   could control that from my iPad, my iPhone, my other iPhone.
[00:58:40.660 --> 00:58:45.820]   No, no, is it I the rumor is that it's also going to support USB hosting.
[00:58:45.820 --> 00:58:47.620]   Is that do you question anything about that?
[00:58:47.620 --> 00:58:48.620]   That's interesting.
[00:58:48.620 --> 00:58:52.020]   So that's something that a lot of Android phones do, which is really cool, which is you
[00:58:52.020 --> 00:58:57.940]   could attach a USB thumb drive or disk drive via the cable and uses external storage.
[00:58:57.940 --> 00:58:59.940]   That's the rumor, but no one said anything one way or the other.
[00:58:59.940 --> 00:59:01.580]   You can do that on some Android phones.
[00:59:01.580 --> 00:59:05.420]   It also it also means that you could hook it to like for instance, your phone, your camera
[00:59:05.420 --> 00:59:07.820]   like a 5d and control the camera directly.
[00:59:07.820 --> 00:59:11.140]   That's always been this issue that there's everyone does all this cool crazy work around
[00:59:11.140 --> 00:59:15.420]   just so they can control their 5d or whatever their Nikon or whatever with their compute
[00:59:15.420 --> 00:59:16.420]   with their iPhone.
[00:59:16.420 --> 00:59:19.860]   Now, and that wasn't possible with the current one.
[00:59:19.860 --> 00:59:21.740]   The theory is that you'll be able to do that.
[00:59:21.740 --> 00:59:24.060]   Do you know anything about that, Andy?
[00:59:24.060 --> 00:59:25.580]   I don't know anything about that would be cool.
[00:59:25.580 --> 00:59:28.060]   I think as a consumer thing would be great.
[00:59:28.060 --> 00:59:32.940]   I don't believe that the 4s can slurp photos in from a camera given that there's iPhoto
[00:59:32.940 --> 00:59:35.220]   on this device, given that there's now LTO on this device.
[00:59:35.220 --> 00:59:37.020]   I have to double check for my myself.
[00:59:37.020 --> 00:59:40.860]   Well, I think the big thing is controlling the camera, not so much pulling the files
[00:59:40.860 --> 00:59:42.980]   out, but being able to.
[00:59:42.980 --> 00:59:46.420]   That's nice too, but in terms of consumer stuff, things you can really put in one of those
[00:59:46.420 --> 00:59:49.900]   nice snappy 30 second commercials, that would be wonderful.
[00:59:49.900 --> 00:59:53.060]   For developers, it would be pretty massive.
[00:59:53.060 --> 00:59:58.340]   To be able to have something that suddenly opens up a lot of these cameras for control.
[00:59:58.340 --> 01:00:04.340]   So speaking of ads, I got to play this.
[01:00:04.340 --> 01:00:08.580]   Anyway, I'm going to play the Samsung ad just a second because Samsung basically is
[01:00:08.580 --> 01:00:12.940]   saying the iPhone, yeah, that's mom and dad's phone, which is an interesting story.
[01:00:12.940 --> 01:00:16.020]   Take actually, I think a very clever and interesting take on this.
[01:00:16.020 --> 01:00:18.900]   But the bottom line, by the way, Sonos said they're not making the dock anymore.
[01:00:18.900 --> 01:00:21.260]   They said, you know what?
[01:00:21.260 --> 01:00:26.420]   I think Sonos just said, if we wash our hands of it, that's it.
[01:00:26.420 --> 01:00:29.620]   We're not going to make a dock for the new connector.
[01:00:29.620 --> 01:00:36.300]   So I don't really know what any of this is going to happen to our Sonos dock.
[01:00:36.300 --> 01:00:39.540]   Are you Chris, what are you going to do?
[01:00:39.540 --> 01:00:45.340]   Well, I use my Sonos for so many other things and I belong to three subscription music services.
[01:00:45.340 --> 01:00:46.340]   Me too.
[01:00:46.340 --> 01:00:48.860]   So it's pretty rare that I even have to use anything that I own.
[01:00:48.860 --> 01:00:52.580]   I just go and grab it on Spotify or Rhapsody or Mom.
[01:00:52.580 --> 01:00:56.660]   It's mostly the audible books and actually they support Audible.
[01:00:56.660 --> 01:01:01.340]   So I guess that's Sonos' point of view is, hey, nobody's going to use the dock anymore.
[01:01:01.340 --> 01:01:04.820]   I just like to because I could charge the phone and be there.
[01:01:04.820 --> 01:01:07.660]   You could say when you docked it, it would start playing immediately.
[01:01:07.660 --> 01:01:13.100]   I mean, it was convenient, but hey, it's just money.
[01:01:13.100 --> 01:01:14.100]   That's all.
[01:01:14.100 --> 01:01:16.900]   Samsung, this is their response.
[01:01:16.900 --> 01:01:22.180]   And even if you're an iPhone 5 fan, as I think we safely could say we are, this is
[01:01:22.180 --> 01:01:23.180]   pretty funny.
[01:01:23.180 --> 01:01:26.540]   Hey, they're saying this phone's going to be like a precious jewel.
[01:01:26.540 --> 01:01:27.540]   I love that.
[01:01:27.540 --> 01:01:31.340]   The headphone jack is going to be on the bottom.
[01:01:31.340 --> 01:01:34.940]   I heard the connector is called to talk.
[01:01:34.940 --> 01:01:35.940]   What?
[01:01:35.940 --> 01:01:36.940]   Who knows?
[01:01:36.940 --> 01:01:42.700]   I'm saying is that they should have a priority line for people who've waited five times.
[01:01:42.700 --> 01:01:45.460]   I heard you have to have an adapter to use the dock on the new one.
[01:01:45.460 --> 01:01:48.860]   Yeah, yeah, but they make the coolest adapters.
[01:01:48.860 --> 01:01:49.860]   Look it back.
[01:01:49.860 --> 01:01:52.060]   I guess the Galaxy S3 didn't work out.
[01:01:52.060 --> 01:01:53.620]   No, I love the GS3.
[01:01:53.620 --> 01:01:55.220]   It's extremely awesome.
[01:01:55.220 --> 01:01:57.380]   I'm just saving a spot in line for someone.
[01:01:57.380 --> 01:01:58.380]   That's not cool.
[01:01:58.380 --> 01:01:59.380]   Yeah, man.
[01:01:59.380 --> 01:02:01.780]   This year, we're finally getting everything that we didn't get last year.
[01:02:01.780 --> 01:02:02.780]   Yeah.
[01:02:02.780 --> 01:02:03.780]   The big screen.
[01:02:03.780 --> 01:02:04.780]   True 4G.
[01:02:04.780 --> 01:02:05.780]   Yep.
[01:02:05.780 --> 01:02:06.780]   What is that?
[01:02:06.780 --> 01:02:07.780]   Hey, what'd you just do?
[01:02:07.780 --> 01:02:09.780]   I just sent them a playlist.
[01:02:09.780 --> 01:02:11.220]   Like touching phones.
[01:02:11.220 --> 01:02:12.220]   Yep.
[01:02:12.220 --> 01:02:13.220]   Simple as that.
[01:02:13.220 --> 01:02:14.220]   It's the Galaxy S3.
[01:02:14.220 --> 01:02:15.220]   Hey, come on.
[01:02:15.220 --> 01:02:16.220]   Dad.
[01:02:16.220 --> 01:02:18.220]   Oh, thanks for holding our spot.
[01:02:18.220 --> 01:02:19.220]   Oh, that was big.
[01:02:19.220 --> 01:02:20.220]   That was a good one.
[01:02:20.220 --> 01:02:21.220]   Saved you a spot.
[01:02:21.220 --> 01:02:22.220]   I moved on.
[01:02:22.220 --> 01:02:23.220]   But you're not going to miss all this.
[01:02:23.220 --> 01:02:24.220]   I got the Samsung GS3 now.
[01:02:24.220 --> 01:02:25.220]   Is that a Samsung?
[01:02:25.220 --> 01:02:26.220]   That's a new Samsung.
[01:02:26.220 --> 01:02:27.220]   It is.
[01:02:27.220 --> 01:02:28.220]   It's pretty cool.
[01:02:28.220 --> 01:02:29.220]   I better come to like it.
[01:02:29.220 --> 01:02:30.220]   This one's pretty cool.
[01:02:30.220 --> 01:02:31.220]   I'm going to miss all this.
[01:02:31.220 --> 01:02:32.220]   I got the Samsung GS3 now.
[01:02:32.220 --> 01:02:33.220]   Is that a Samsung?
[01:02:33.220 --> 01:02:34.220]   That's a new Samsung.
[01:02:34.220 --> 01:02:35.220]   It is.
[01:02:35.220 --> 01:02:36.220]   This one's 4G.
[01:02:36.220 --> 01:02:37.220]   Yeah.
[01:02:37.220 --> 01:02:38.540]   We've had that for a while.
[01:02:38.540 --> 01:02:40.100]   This one's got a big screen.
[01:02:40.100 --> 01:02:41.100]   This one has a bigger one.
[01:02:41.100 --> 01:02:42.100]   And we can share videos instantly.
[01:02:42.100 --> 01:02:44.660]   You can watch a video while you're sending an email.
[01:02:44.660 --> 01:02:47.140]   But we're going to get that for sure.
[01:02:47.140 --> 01:02:49.940]   Maybe not this time, but the next time, right?
[01:02:49.940 --> 01:02:51.380]   The next big thing is already here.
[01:02:51.380 --> 01:02:53.340]   The Samsung Galaxy S3.
[01:02:53.340 --> 01:02:55.660]   The iPhone is Mom and Dad's phone.
[01:02:55.660 --> 01:02:56.660]   It's good at...
[01:02:56.660 --> 01:02:57.660]   Yeah.
[01:02:57.660 --> 01:02:58.660]   That was a burn.
[01:02:58.660 --> 01:02:59.660]   Burn!
[01:02:59.660 --> 01:03:01.940]   I'm a mom and dad.
[01:03:01.940 --> 01:03:02.940]   It's okay.
[01:03:02.940 --> 01:03:07.300]   Let's see that this shows that Samsung has not learned anything from the billion dollar
[01:03:07.300 --> 01:03:08.300]   lawsuit.
[01:03:08.300 --> 01:03:11.340]   Now they're copying Apple's idea of telling you effective commercials and making them
[01:03:11.340 --> 01:03:12.340]   funny.
[01:03:12.340 --> 01:03:13.340]   Faster.
[01:03:13.340 --> 01:03:14.340]   Damn them.
[01:03:14.340 --> 01:03:15.340]   How could they...
[01:03:15.340 --> 01:03:16.340]   They stole that too.
[01:03:16.340 --> 01:03:17.340]   Well, I will tell you.
[01:03:17.340 --> 01:03:18.980]   I have a bad story.
[01:03:18.980 --> 01:03:19.980]   Okay.
[01:03:19.980 --> 01:03:23.580]   My daughter, it's about time that she needs to get a cell phone of some kind.
[01:03:23.580 --> 01:03:24.580]   And so, well, great.
[01:03:24.580 --> 01:03:27.020]   I can pass along my iPhone 4.
[01:03:27.020 --> 01:03:30.500]   And she was very nice about saying, "No."
[01:03:30.500 --> 01:03:31.500]   Yeah.
[01:03:31.500 --> 01:03:32.500]   That's what?
[01:03:32.500 --> 01:03:33.500]   You want an iPhone 5?
[01:03:33.500 --> 01:03:34.500]   There's no way I'm getting it.
[01:03:34.500 --> 01:03:37.500]   She goes, "No, I want one of the kind of phones that my friends have."
[01:03:37.500 --> 01:03:39.060]   So, "Well, what do they have?"
[01:03:39.060 --> 01:03:40.060]   And they...
[01:03:40.060 --> 01:03:42.340]   Turns out they have these really terrible Android phones.
[01:03:42.340 --> 01:03:44.260]   The parents have given them because basically they're free.
[01:03:44.260 --> 01:03:45.260]   They're cheap.
[01:03:45.260 --> 01:03:46.260]   Yeah.
[01:03:46.260 --> 01:03:47.260]   So, they're cheap.
[01:03:47.260 --> 01:03:49.260]   So, this is about having a really cool piece of technology.
[01:03:49.260 --> 01:03:50.500]   It's about what your friends have.
[01:03:50.500 --> 01:03:55.940]   And when you're about 11 or 12, you buy the really cheap Android and say, "Here."
[01:03:55.940 --> 01:03:59.300]   Also, you know, that's where Android's making some of its money from.
[01:03:59.300 --> 01:04:02.180]   But that's a big story because for a long time, this was...
[01:04:02.180 --> 01:04:06.180]   I mean, I think a lot of the reasons the iPhone sells and still sells is because it's
[01:04:06.180 --> 01:04:07.180]   hip.
[01:04:07.180 --> 01:04:08.180]   It's cool.
[01:04:08.180 --> 01:04:09.540]   It's the phone to have, right?
[01:04:09.540 --> 01:04:12.460]   But if it's not anymore, that's not good.
[01:04:12.460 --> 01:04:13.460]   I had a question.
[01:04:13.460 --> 01:04:18.780]   Well, I think that when you're in college or maybe in high school, the cool phone is
[01:04:18.780 --> 01:04:19.780]   the iPhone.
[01:04:19.780 --> 01:04:20.780]   I wonder.
[01:04:20.780 --> 01:04:24.100]   I've seen awful lot of them around.
[01:04:24.100 --> 01:04:27.780]   But I do know that in sort of that tweenset where they do junior high where they need
[01:04:27.780 --> 01:04:30.380]   to have a phone, parents aren't giving them those things.
[01:04:30.380 --> 01:04:31.380]   No, I would...
[01:04:31.380 --> 01:04:32.940]   And they made a glass for Christ's sake.
[01:04:32.940 --> 01:04:33.940]   You're not going to have it.
[01:04:33.940 --> 01:04:34.940]   Yeah, right.
[01:04:34.940 --> 01:04:38.620]   They gave a 13-year-old something made out of glass and say, "Yeah, in fact..."
[01:04:38.620 --> 01:04:41.540]   Oh, and I don't want to tell the story is sad.
[01:04:41.540 --> 01:04:42.540]   Go ahead, Andy.
[01:04:42.540 --> 01:04:43.540]   You were saying something.
[01:04:43.540 --> 01:04:47.980]   I was just going to say, I had a conversation very similar to yours where a teenager that
[01:04:47.980 --> 01:04:48.980]   was...
[01:04:48.980 --> 01:04:54.260]   I was talking to over the summer, a relative was saying, "Ask me about phones because it's
[01:04:54.260 --> 01:04:57.340]   time for him to get another phone in the summer."
[01:04:57.340 --> 01:05:00.300]   I'm talking about, "Well, the iPhone 4S is pretty good, but the Apple's probably going
[01:05:00.300 --> 01:05:03.740]   to have a really cool iPhone 5 in September."
[01:05:03.740 --> 01:05:05.900]   And he said, "I don't want an iPhone.
[01:05:05.900 --> 01:05:07.540]   That's the phone that my dad has."
[01:05:07.540 --> 01:05:08.540]   Yeah.
[01:05:08.540 --> 01:05:09.540]   And I'm like, "Oh, dear.
[01:05:09.540 --> 01:05:10.540]   I really am that old."
[01:05:10.540 --> 01:05:11.740]   But I'm not old, not sold.
[01:05:11.740 --> 01:05:14.540]   I don't remember what it's like to...
[01:05:14.540 --> 01:05:20.380]   Even if your car drives the coolest car in the world, it is by definition un-hipped by
[01:05:20.380 --> 01:05:22.100]   the virtue of the fact that your dad drives it.
[01:05:22.100 --> 01:05:23.500]   Yes, that's right.
[01:05:23.500 --> 01:05:24.940]   Even if it's a maserati.
[01:05:24.940 --> 01:05:25.940]   Here is...
[01:05:25.940 --> 01:05:29.260]   Some people are making hay on the fact that there is no more docking.
[01:05:29.260 --> 01:05:31.700]   This is an ad from Jawbone.
[01:05:31.700 --> 01:05:37.740]   This is a dock with a clock.
[01:05:37.740 --> 01:05:46.420]   And it blows up into little, tiny, pieces.
[01:05:46.420 --> 01:05:48.620]   I have to describe this for the audio.
[01:05:48.620 --> 01:05:50.980]   These circuits flying through the air.
[01:05:50.980 --> 01:05:53.740]   This is what looks like the Bose dock.
[01:05:53.740 --> 01:05:57.180]   And it blows up into little, tiny pieces.
[01:05:57.180 --> 01:06:01.500]   Because Jawbone is selling their jam box, which is Bluetooth.
[01:06:01.500 --> 01:06:05.540]   And I think the point they're making is who needs a dock?
[01:06:05.540 --> 01:06:10.340]   Because aren't you just going to use Bluetooth from now on?
[01:06:10.340 --> 01:06:12.580]   But Bluetooth doesn't give you iPod control.
[01:06:12.580 --> 01:06:14.340]   You can play and pause.
[01:06:14.340 --> 01:06:15.340]   No, but...
[01:06:15.340 --> 01:06:16.340]   Next.
[01:06:16.340 --> 01:06:18.300]   That's okay because you've got your iPod and your hand.
[01:06:18.300 --> 01:06:19.300]   In your hand.
[01:06:19.300 --> 01:06:20.300]   So the control is there.
[01:06:20.300 --> 01:06:23.620]   You have even better remote control than you would if you had a wired thing.
[01:06:23.620 --> 01:06:24.620]   Okay.
[01:06:24.620 --> 01:06:25.620]   The jam box is pretty awesome, by the way.
[01:06:25.620 --> 01:06:26.620]   It is.
[01:06:26.620 --> 01:06:27.780]   That's the bad for the big, the jam box.
[01:06:27.780 --> 01:06:28.780]   The giant.
[01:06:28.780 --> 01:06:29.780]   That one's awesome too.
[01:06:29.780 --> 01:06:30.780]   Jumbo jam box.
[01:06:30.780 --> 01:06:31.780]   I'll tell you.
[01:06:31.780 --> 01:06:35.500]   I have to say that one of the last things that blew up was a Logitech device, which is
[01:06:35.500 --> 01:06:37.900]   available in a dock or a Bluetooth model.
[01:06:37.900 --> 01:06:40.940]   Yeah, Logitech's now got that UE line, the Ultimate Ears line.
[01:06:40.940 --> 01:06:44.340]   In fact, it wasn't that little.
[01:06:44.340 --> 01:06:47.260]   The one that looks like a boom box.
[01:06:47.260 --> 01:06:48.260]   I think it's regular.
[01:06:48.260 --> 01:06:49.260]   Beautiful.
[01:06:49.260 --> 01:06:50.260]   It's beautiful.
[01:06:50.260 --> 01:06:51.260]   It's gorgeous.
[01:06:51.260 --> 01:06:53.260]   The sound is good.
[01:06:53.260 --> 01:06:54.980]   The bass was not as good as I was hoping for.
[01:06:54.980 --> 01:06:57.580]   But you know, these little speaker systems are not going to get.
[01:06:57.580 --> 01:06:58.580]   Bass is big.
[01:06:58.580 --> 01:07:01.900]   The top end isn't quite as good as I would have liked it.
[01:07:01.900 --> 01:07:06.300]   I can either set up every single room in the house with wireless speakers or I can have
[01:07:06.300 --> 01:07:08.100]   this rechargeable boom box.
[01:07:08.100 --> 01:07:10.500]   But that can simply carry in.
[01:07:10.500 --> 01:07:14.340]   No, that's a good point because I'm going to put Sonos in every room.
[01:07:14.340 --> 01:07:16.340]   That's like $2,000.
[01:07:16.340 --> 01:07:19.060]   We're the Sonos gadgets.
[01:07:19.060 --> 01:07:23.700]   I started going down the path of Sonos and then I added up what I needed in those ICs.
[01:07:23.700 --> 01:07:25.740]   Oh, I have to think about that a little longer.
[01:07:25.740 --> 01:07:26.740]   Yeah, it's pricey.
[01:07:26.740 --> 01:07:27.740]   What about-
[01:07:27.740 --> 01:07:29.540]   You have to grow it over time.
[01:07:29.540 --> 01:07:30.540]   That's right.
[01:07:30.540 --> 01:07:32.380]   You've got to come up for units and then the next year you get another one.
[01:07:32.380 --> 01:07:33.380]   That's right.
[01:07:33.380 --> 01:07:34.380]   Before you know it, you've got a house full of stuff.
[01:07:34.380 --> 01:07:35.380]   Well, and that's where it divorced really.
[01:07:35.380 --> 01:07:36.380]   You spent a house full of your guys.
[01:07:36.380 --> 01:07:39.500]   You had to split the Sonos and that was terrible.
[01:07:39.500 --> 01:07:40.500]   You got half.
[01:07:40.500 --> 01:07:42.300]   I got half of many Sonos.
[01:07:42.300 --> 01:07:43.300]   I got the dock though.
[01:07:43.300 --> 01:07:44.300]   I got the custom dock.
[01:07:44.300 --> 01:07:46.100]   That's not so good.
[01:07:46.100 --> 01:07:50.220]   So Apple is getting in a little bit of trouble for stealing the clock.
[01:07:50.220 --> 01:07:55.180]   First of all, I have no idea why Apple finally puts a clock on the iPad.
[01:07:55.180 --> 01:07:59.260]   In iOS 6, there's a clock app on the iPad.
[01:07:59.260 --> 01:08:01.380]   We went years without a clock app.
[01:08:01.380 --> 01:08:05.860]   In fact, as a result, things like the beautiful Emerald Observatory, which Andy has recommended,
[01:08:05.860 --> 01:08:09.580]   it's gorgeous clock app that you download on your-
[01:08:09.580 --> 01:08:10.580]   I think it's free.
[01:08:10.580 --> 01:08:12.780]   Maybe not, but it's worth paying a few bucks for.
[01:08:12.780 --> 01:08:14.260]   So now Apple has a new clock app.
[01:08:14.260 --> 01:08:15.940]   You won't see this on the iPhone.
[01:08:15.940 --> 01:08:21.380]   It's the iPad clock app has clocks that look surprisingly.
[01:08:21.380 --> 01:08:28.580]   In fact, exactly like the trademarked Swiss railway clock design.
[01:08:28.580 --> 01:08:31.220]   Yeah, it was exactly.
[01:08:31.220 --> 01:08:35.500]   I mean, I think any jury in the land would convict them on that one.
[01:08:35.500 --> 01:08:41.180]   The Swiss Federal Railway Service told a Jean-Francois press that it would meet in the coming days
[01:08:41.180 --> 01:08:44.620]   or weeks with Apple representatives to reach an agreement.
[01:08:44.620 --> 01:08:46.500]   There's another one.
[01:08:46.500 --> 01:08:48.060]   Is that your watch, Andy?
[01:08:48.060 --> 01:08:54.660]   That is my Swiss-licensed Swiss Railway watch, which I now refer to as the special ultra-limited
[01:08:54.660 --> 01:08:57.300]   edition iPad clock.
[01:08:57.300 --> 01:09:02.660]   So the thing that's distinct about it is the second hand with a big red dot on it.
[01:09:02.660 --> 01:09:09.140]   But it is- I mean, this is like my first grown-up watch after buying nothing but digital watches
[01:09:09.140 --> 01:09:11.300]   and like Star Wars license watches.
[01:09:11.300 --> 01:09:14.980]   And this is just such a gorgeous, gorgeous design that after spending like three months
[01:09:14.980 --> 01:09:18.100]   waffling about it, as soon as I saw this, it was like, "Oh, that's very pretty.
[01:09:18.100 --> 01:09:19.500]   I want that one."
[01:09:19.500 --> 01:09:25.900]   But yeah, I mean, this is why I had a little bit of- I couldn't put full-throated support
[01:09:25.900 --> 01:09:31.860]   behind Apple's victory against Samsung, not because Samsung didn't steal the iPhone,
[01:09:31.860 --> 01:09:33.220]   which they absolutely did.
[01:09:33.220 --> 01:09:35.100]   It's such a dense paper trail.
[01:09:35.100 --> 01:09:40.260]   But it was a lot of the stuff being discussed around it was that, "No, no, we don't know.
[01:09:40.260 --> 01:09:41.260]   We innovate.
[01:09:41.260 --> 01:09:42.260]   I hope they don't steal."
[01:09:42.260 --> 01:09:43.900]   It's like, "No, this is..."
[01:09:43.900 --> 01:09:44.900]   "You copy?"
[01:09:44.900 --> 01:09:49.700]   And it's not even really theft part of design is saying, "Ooh, that's a nice design."
[01:09:49.700 --> 01:09:51.540]   It's not protected by patent.
[01:09:51.540 --> 01:09:54.940]   I think I will actually use it for my own project because it really works very well.
[01:09:54.940 --> 01:10:00.180]   So the good news is that the Swiss are very polite.
[01:10:00.180 --> 01:10:06.660]   And they don't believe in- so they say the SBB, the Swiss Federal Railway Service, said
[01:10:06.660 --> 01:10:10.900]   they, "Did not intend to upset Apple by asking for money."
[01:10:10.900 --> 01:10:16.580]   And that they were proud that their clock had been chosen for iOS 6.
[01:10:16.580 --> 01:10:19.420]   Oh, blown opportunity.
[01:10:19.420 --> 01:10:21.380]   Free iPads for a lot of mayors.
[01:10:21.380 --> 01:10:25.100]   I bet they asked for a little bit of money.
[01:10:25.100 --> 01:10:28.100]   Every conductor gets an iPod nano something.
[01:10:28.100 --> 01:10:30.100]   There's something in there.
[01:10:30.100 --> 01:10:32.020]   Ten dollar gift card, something.
[01:10:32.020 --> 01:10:35.660]   They do make money licensing that design.
[01:10:35.660 --> 01:10:41.620]   And maybe it is valuable because if word spreads it, "Oh, by the way, if you like the design
[01:10:41.620 --> 01:10:45.820]   on your iPad, you can actually have it as a watch or as a wall clock or something else."
[01:10:45.820 --> 01:10:47.300]   And maybe it's just about...
[01:10:47.300 --> 01:10:51.740]   By the shock, if they didn't go for something that simply said, "Give us a line of gray
[01:10:51.740 --> 01:10:55.900]   text somewhere at some point of that app that says, 'By the way, that's a license and
[01:10:55.900 --> 01:10:56.900]   a fruit.
[01:10:56.900 --> 01:10:59.260]   You sell it for $1 per year if you have to."
[01:10:59.260 --> 01:11:01.300]   I think they have to do that.
[01:11:01.300 --> 01:11:04.140]   They can't go in simply saying, "You want to steal our idea for a clock?"
[01:11:04.140 --> 01:11:05.140]   Sure.
[01:11:05.140 --> 01:11:06.140]   Yeah, go ahead.
[01:11:06.140 --> 01:11:10.100]   Well, I think what they've done is they've just changed the combination on the vault or
[01:11:10.100 --> 01:11:11.100]   Apple's bullion.
[01:11:11.100 --> 01:11:12.100]   [laughter]
[01:11:12.100 --> 01:11:19.140]   Why have we switched banks and say, "Well, gosh, I think we've lost that combination.
[01:11:19.140 --> 01:11:21.540]   Why wonder what might?"
[01:11:21.540 --> 01:11:23.620]   Yeah, a little cut here.
[01:11:23.620 --> 01:11:24.620]   Oh, that's it.
[01:11:24.620 --> 01:11:25.620]   It's seven.
[01:11:25.620 --> 01:11:29.060]   We're going to take a break, come back.
[01:11:29.060 --> 01:11:30.860]   We have lots more to talk about.
[01:11:30.860 --> 01:11:31.860]   We talked about the ugly.
[01:11:31.860 --> 01:11:34.580]   Let's talk about the good of the iPhone 5.
[01:11:34.580 --> 01:11:35.580]   It's thin.
[01:11:35.580 --> 01:11:36.580]   It's tall.
[01:11:36.580 --> 01:11:37.580]   It's thin.
[01:11:37.580 --> 01:11:39.580]   I'm telling you, it's a work of art.
[01:11:39.580 --> 01:11:42.420]   I think if you get the black one, you're going to want to put a black and white image
[01:11:42.420 --> 01:11:45.060]   on your lock screen so that it can...
[01:11:45.060 --> 01:11:48.900]   By the way, they should Apple should really require that.
[01:11:48.900 --> 01:11:52.340]   No color images on the front of the lock screen.
[01:11:52.340 --> 01:11:53.340]   Of course not.
[01:11:53.340 --> 01:11:58.140]   It needs to be a black and white, very geometric image because it enhances the overall monolithic
[01:11:58.140 --> 01:11:59.140]   aspect.
[01:11:59.140 --> 01:12:00.140]   [sings]
[01:12:00.140 --> 01:12:08.140]   This show brought to you by our friends at Ford Motor Company who have a brand new web
[01:12:08.140 --> 01:12:11.700]   page they want you all to know about social.ford.com.
[01:12:11.700 --> 01:12:13.060]   Ford's doing social.
[01:12:13.060 --> 01:12:14.060]   I think they're doing it right.
[01:12:14.060 --> 01:12:15.420]   They're doing some really interesting things.
[01:12:15.420 --> 01:12:17.140]   First of all, there's a lot of content here.
[01:12:17.140 --> 01:12:19.540]   This isn't just kind of an empty site.
[01:12:19.540 --> 01:12:21.420]   They have a ton of articles.
[01:12:21.420 --> 01:12:25.500]   I know that because I wrote one about my conversation with a Ford technologist, Jim
[01:12:25.500 --> 01:12:30.540]   Butchkaoski, about the future of Ford Sync, the API, autonomous vehicles and more.
[01:12:30.540 --> 01:12:32.820]   You'll find all of this in the technology section.
[01:12:32.820 --> 01:12:36.980]   They also though invite you to submit your stories about your Ford experience.
[01:12:36.980 --> 01:12:38.820]   I love this.
[01:12:38.820 --> 01:12:42.700]   People who own Ford's, they just do something about...
[01:12:42.700 --> 01:12:44.420]   We're a special breed.
[01:12:44.420 --> 01:12:46.340]   We're proud of our cars.
[01:12:46.340 --> 01:12:48.100]   And here's a great idea.
[01:12:48.100 --> 01:12:50.220]   A place where you can submit your ideas.
[01:12:50.220 --> 01:12:52.940]   Kind of a suggestion box for Ford owners.
[01:12:52.940 --> 01:12:58.660]   Things that you'd like to see and you can vote on the ideas as well, which is nice.
[01:12:58.660 --> 01:13:00.740]   You can rank them by popularity.
[01:13:00.740 --> 01:13:05.940]   Course pictures and videos of people with their fords and for post stuff there as well, which
[01:13:05.940 --> 01:13:08.700]   is fantastic.
[01:13:08.700 --> 01:13:11.700]   And if you visit, you might want to grab a badge as well.
[01:13:11.700 --> 01:13:16.500]   Read the articles, make suggestions, grab your tech geek badge.
[01:13:16.500 --> 01:13:17.940]   You're not just ahead of the curve.
[01:13:17.940 --> 01:13:19.180]   You're the one leading it.
[01:13:19.180 --> 01:13:23.660]   They have a whole bunch of great badges where you can show your Ford pride.
[01:13:23.660 --> 01:13:25.900]   I think the Mustang badge.
[01:13:25.900 --> 01:13:27.060]   I like that.
[01:13:27.060 --> 01:13:29.700]   But there's quite a few in a variety of categories.
[01:13:29.700 --> 01:13:31.540]   So give it a visit.
[01:13:31.540 --> 01:13:34.140]   We'll get social.ford.com.
[01:13:34.140 --> 01:13:35.740]   And by the way, the new...
[01:13:35.740 --> 01:13:36.740]   I've been waiting for them.
[01:13:36.740 --> 01:13:43.500]   The 2013 Fusions have been announced, including their plug-in hybrid, the energy, and just
[01:13:43.500 --> 01:13:45.500]   some really neat stuff.
[01:13:45.500 --> 01:13:46.500]   Find out more.
[01:13:46.500 --> 01:13:48.180]   Go further and afford.
[01:13:48.180 --> 01:13:53.180]   Visit your Ford dealer today and social.ford.com.
[01:13:53.180 --> 01:13:55.180]   All right.
[01:13:55.180 --> 01:13:56.180]   All right.
[01:13:56.180 --> 01:13:57.180]   All right.
[01:13:57.180 --> 01:14:00.100]   There's plenty of good stuff in here.
[01:14:00.100 --> 01:14:01.860]   Plenty of good stuff.
[01:14:01.860 --> 01:14:04.220]   You'll get a whole extra row of icons.
[01:14:04.220 --> 01:14:05.220]   That's nice.
[01:14:05.220 --> 01:14:06.220]   Awesome.
[01:14:06.220 --> 01:14:08.660]   Also, let's talk about how good the color of the screen is.
[01:14:08.660 --> 01:14:09.900]   It is a beautiful screen.
[01:14:09.900 --> 01:14:11.380]   I have to say.
[01:14:11.380 --> 01:14:17.020]   And even comparing with the 4S, you play a movie like The Godfather with extreme cinematography.
[01:14:17.020 --> 01:14:22.180]   It's the first one where the blacks in this shot are supposed to be absolutely black
[01:14:22.180 --> 01:14:25.740]   and you get a full range of color all the way to the highlights.
[01:14:25.740 --> 01:14:27.300]   It is just such a gorgeous thing.
[01:14:27.300 --> 01:14:29.180]   I saw a couple people complaining about how...
[01:14:29.180 --> 01:14:33.060]   Well, it's technically not a true 720p HD display.
[01:14:33.060 --> 01:14:36.660]   I mean, on the ends of it, we've had HD display for quite some time now.
[01:14:36.660 --> 01:14:40.140]   You know, you can keep your technically correct HD displays.
[01:14:40.140 --> 01:14:45.220]   On this sub-HD screen looks two times better than any other Android phone I've ever seen.
[01:14:45.220 --> 01:14:48.980]   They're claiming a broader color gamut, almost full SRGB.
[01:14:48.980 --> 01:14:51.380]   What does that mean?
[01:14:51.380 --> 01:14:55.580]   Basically the full box crayons, instead of a smaller box crayons.
[01:14:55.580 --> 01:15:01.340]   Really, all I can really say is that the contrast is snapper without being artificial
[01:15:01.340 --> 01:15:04.700]   and the blacks are just a spinal tap black.
[01:15:04.700 --> 01:15:06.180]   How much more black could this be?
[01:15:06.180 --> 01:15:10.420]   The answer is none, none more black than this.
[01:15:10.420 --> 01:15:11.420]   My usual two-twork.
[01:15:11.420 --> 01:15:13.420]   A spinal tap black.
[01:15:13.420 --> 01:15:21.700]   My usual two tests for video are the Godfather and up because those are two pretty extreme
[01:15:21.700 --> 01:15:26.220]   examples, the Godfather for the blacks, but also up for what if you have a scene which
[01:15:26.220 --> 01:15:29.620]   is nothing but a million brightly colored balloons.
[01:15:29.620 --> 01:15:34.020]   Do the balloons have shading and highlights on them or are they just like dots of magic
[01:15:34.020 --> 01:15:39.580]   marker because your display can't display enough colors to really render that correctly.
[01:15:39.580 --> 01:15:42.100]   And the iPhone 5 is just magnificent.
[01:15:42.100 --> 01:15:46.380]   Godfather is a good choice because especially at the beginning, Godfather 1 is very dark,
[01:15:46.380 --> 01:15:47.380]   intentionally so.
[01:15:47.380 --> 01:15:51.100]   The cinematographer's nickname is the Prince of Darkness.
[01:15:51.100 --> 01:15:56.500]   And he dragged the film stock through chemicals to give it kind of an interesting color cast.
[01:15:56.500 --> 01:16:01.220]   And so if you get the Blu-ray and you watch it on a great screen, you can really see that.
[01:16:01.220 --> 01:16:05.380]   If you get an older DVD, it looks horrible because they did a lot of bad transfers.
[01:16:05.380 --> 01:16:09.580]   So that's an example where you might even not be getting the best images unless you go
[01:16:09.580 --> 01:16:12.660]   out and get the new Coppola approved DVD of that.
[01:16:12.660 --> 01:16:14.740]   So I think I agree with you.
[01:16:14.740 --> 01:16:17.100]   That's a great test.
[01:16:17.100 --> 01:16:20.620]   Now what about, I'm looking at the Netflix app because they haven't updated it.
[01:16:20.620 --> 01:16:23.820]   It's not filling the screen which is kind of a little bit disappointing.
[01:16:23.820 --> 01:16:25.940]   It's going to take a while to fix that.
[01:16:25.940 --> 01:16:27.260]   All of Apple's apps now.
[01:16:27.260 --> 01:16:31.140]   And if you get it by the way, a little tip, get the black iPhone because you can't tell
[01:16:31.140 --> 01:16:36.460]   it's not filling the screen because the black merges nicely with the bezel.
[01:16:36.460 --> 01:16:40.140]   But there are apps, quite a few that don't fill the screen and then there are apps that
[01:16:40.140 --> 01:16:41.740]   do like all the Apple apps.
[01:16:41.740 --> 01:16:46.940]   And you don't get that top and bottom bar on that thing.
[01:16:46.940 --> 01:16:50.100]   I guess that's just going to be a matter of time.
[01:16:50.100 --> 01:16:52.060]   Yeah.
[01:16:52.060 --> 01:16:53.660]   What else do we like about it?
[01:16:53.660 --> 01:16:56.260]   The speed is amazing.
[01:16:56.260 --> 01:17:00.500]   Every benchmark I've tried has been twice the speed of the 4S.
[01:17:00.500 --> 01:17:03.180]   And I've talked not just like geek bench benchmarks.
[01:17:03.180 --> 01:17:06.820]   I'm talking about things that actually take a lot of time to process.
[01:17:06.820 --> 01:17:10.300]   Another test that I usually do is the auto stitch app.
[01:17:10.300 --> 01:17:16.620]   I did a 16 photo panorama stitch which was done in half the time.
[01:17:16.620 --> 01:17:18.300]   Oh, it's amazing though.
[01:17:18.300 --> 01:17:20.660]   If you use the built in panorama, it's instant.
[01:17:20.660 --> 01:17:23.700]   I'd say for the iPhone 5 but iOS 6.
[01:17:23.700 --> 01:17:25.780]   I've been testing that.
[01:17:25.780 --> 01:17:28.300]   The new built in panorama is just stunning.
[01:17:28.300 --> 01:17:29.300]   Yeah.
[01:17:29.300 --> 01:17:30.300]   Yeah.
[01:17:30.300 --> 01:17:31.300]   It's a good feature.
[01:17:31.300 --> 01:17:32.300]   But I use it as a test of math.
[01:17:32.300 --> 01:17:33.900]   I understand how fast it is.
[01:17:33.900 --> 01:17:36.420]   But it's a much faster processor.
[01:17:36.420 --> 01:17:39.020]   It's much, much faster but also the extra RAM really helps.
[01:17:39.020 --> 01:17:45.140]   I did a test where the upper limit, the hard upper limit that auto stitch has is 40 images.
[01:17:45.140 --> 01:17:47.620]   You can't try to do auto stitch more than 40.
[01:17:47.620 --> 01:17:48.620]   For good reason.
[01:17:48.620 --> 01:17:49.620]   Exactly.
[01:17:49.620 --> 01:17:52.420]   So I restarted both phones.
[01:17:52.420 --> 01:17:57.060]   They tried to do a 40 image stitch with the 4S and it crashed.
[01:17:57.060 --> 01:18:00.940]   But it made, absolutely had no problems on the iPhone 5.
[01:18:00.940 --> 01:18:04.260]   So it was definitely some help you're getting through that extra amount of system RAM.
[01:18:04.260 --> 01:18:08.660]   Gigabyte of RAM now instead of 512 RAM.
[01:18:08.660 --> 01:18:13.980]   And I think in most cases the speed improvement you won't notice.
[01:18:13.980 --> 01:18:17.460]   You have to go to things like stitching to really see a big difference.
[01:18:17.460 --> 01:18:18.460]   Yeah.
[01:18:18.460 --> 01:18:20.620]   What's so strong about it?
[01:18:20.620 --> 01:18:28.020]   If you actually just do the Geekbench scores, the iPhone 5 is hugely over the 4S.
[01:18:28.020 --> 01:18:30.740]   It's actually about the same as the Galaxy S3.
[01:18:30.740 --> 01:18:35.540]   But the difference is that in iOS you get applications that can actually use all that
[01:18:35.540 --> 01:18:36.540]   CPU power.
[01:18:36.540 --> 01:18:40.460]   Like I-Poto that are now a little bit snappier, much more responsive than they were in the
[01:18:40.460 --> 01:18:41.460]   4S.
[01:18:41.460 --> 01:18:46.620]   On the Samsung really you're using that extra CPU power for gaming and for running Geekbench
[01:18:46.620 --> 01:18:47.620]   scores.
[01:18:47.620 --> 01:18:50.580]   You rarely get to see it the way you can see it in iOS.
[01:18:50.580 --> 01:18:52.380]   That is a huge advantage.
[01:18:52.380 --> 01:18:58.980]   There is no doubt in PC Magazine said that the new iPhone 5 is the fastest by a good margin
[01:18:58.980 --> 01:18:59.980]   smartphone out there.
[01:18:59.980 --> 01:19:05.180]   And this system on a chip that Apple built is really- oh, I got ran into a tree.
[01:19:05.180 --> 01:19:07.980]   It's faster for running into trees even.
[01:19:07.980 --> 01:19:11.620]   It's just too fast.
[01:19:11.620 --> 01:19:12.620]   That's the problem.
[01:19:12.620 --> 01:19:13.620]   It's too fast.
[01:19:13.620 --> 01:19:15.020]   I can't keep up.
[01:19:15.020 --> 01:19:16.020]   And the new earbuds.
[01:19:16.020 --> 01:19:21.500]   In fact, Chris, have you played with the new earbuds?
[01:19:21.500 --> 01:19:22.500]   What do you think?
[01:19:22.500 --> 01:19:23.500]   You're the musician.
[01:19:23.500 --> 01:19:25.100]   I have not played with the new earbuds.
[01:19:25.100 --> 01:19:27.260]   I have people I trust who have played with the new earbuds.
[01:19:27.260 --> 01:19:31.900]   They say they fit much better than the old ones, which is half the battle.
[01:19:31.900 --> 01:19:35.740]   People who really, really like headphones have found that the bass responses and all
[01:19:35.740 --> 01:19:38.500]   that great and the low mids isn't all that great.
[01:19:38.500 --> 01:19:41.980]   So there's $30 headphones though, right?
[01:19:41.980 --> 01:19:45.860]   Yeah, there are $30 headphones and they're free if you get them with the right devices.
[01:19:45.860 --> 01:19:51.980]   So there's certainly a step up in that they'll actually stay in your ears and they're okay.
[01:19:51.980 --> 01:19:55.900]   But clearly if you want really great sound, you're going to spend more money for a good
[01:19:55.900 --> 01:19:56.900]   set of headphones.
[01:19:56.900 --> 01:19:57.900]   I was impressed.
[01:19:57.900 --> 01:20:00.940]   I thought these were better than they needed to be.
[01:20:00.940 --> 01:20:05.780]   Let's put it that way, given that these are the gimme headphones that you get.
[01:20:05.780 --> 01:20:10.620]   And they do have new ads, by the way, with Jeff Daniels narrating.
[01:20:10.620 --> 01:20:12.780]   Here are the new.
[01:20:12.780 --> 01:20:13.780]   Let's see.
[01:20:13.780 --> 01:20:14.860]   Your thumb.
[01:20:14.860 --> 01:20:18.460]   It goes from here to here.
[01:20:18.460 --> 01:20:21.780]   This bigger screen goes from here to here.
[01:20:21.780 --> 01:20:24.020]   Showing why the screen's not wider.
[01:20:24.020 --> 01:20:30.020]   Now, that's either A, an amazing coincidence.
[01:20:30.020 --> 01:20:34.020]   Or B, a dazzling display of common sense.
[01:20:34.020 --> 01:20:39.860]   This is how they respond to the much larger funds from Samsung and LG.
[01:20:39.860 --> 01:20:44.020]   He looks like he's holding it very comfortably.
[01:20:44.020 --> 01:20:45.740]   So that's the thumbs ad.
[01:20:45.740 --> 01:20:46.740]   Here's it.
[01:20:46.740 --> 01:20:47.740]   What?
[01:20:47.740 --> 01:20:51.460]   I got to say, I kind of call BS on that.
[01:20:51.460 --> 01:20:54.900]   I've been using it for a couple of days.
[01:20:54.900 --> 01:20:58.180]   It's a lot easier to use than something as big as this.
[01:20:58.180 --> 01:21:00.020]   Absolutely no question about that.
[01:21:00.020 --> 01:21:01.380]   But it's just not true.
[01:21:01.380 --> 01:21:04.580]   We're asked on the regular iPhone 4.
[01:21:04.580 --> 01:21:08.100]   I can easily cover the entire screen with one hand, with one thumb.
[01:21:08.100 --> 01:21:12.460]   On the iPhone 5, just like with these larger phones, I have to sort of scoot it around in
[01:21:12.460 --> 01:21:14.460]   my hand to get at the top of it.
[01:21:14.460 --> 01:21:17.900]   The top most corner, I can't even reach with my thumb.
[01:21:17.900 --> 01:21:21.420]   So if you're asking for some flexibility training, maybe some stretchy.
[01:21:21.420 --> 01:21:23.420]   I need to do hand polotti.
[01:21:23.420 --> 01:21:29.420]   You get that special beautiful wooden table that lets me just do the downward dog with.
[01:21:29.420 --> 01:21:30.420]   Exactly.
[01:21:30.420 --> 01:21:33.420]   Maybe that's our next show.
[01:21:33.420 --> 01:21:34.420]   Hand polotti.
[01:21:34.420 --> 01:21:35.420]   Yeah.
[01:21:35.420 --> 01:21:37.820]   Can I be hand dancing as well?
[01:21:37.820 --> 01:21:39.420]   This is called cheese.
[01:21:39.420 --> 01:21:47.380]   So I mean, if I bet that if I hard mounted my iPhone 5 to a light stand, you would be
[01:21:47.380 --> 01:21:48.380]   able to do this.
[01:21:48.380 --> 01:21:50.580]   And I just had my hand around.
[01:21:50.580 --> 01:21:52.260]   I didn't have to actually support it while I'm doing it.
[01:21:52.260 --> 01:21:53.260]   I bet I could actually reach the screen.
[01:21:53.260 --> 01:21:55.380]   Oh, you think that's how they did that?
[01:21:55.380 --> 01:21:59.740]   I don't think that this was just a free floating hand that had a hold that I think that it
[01:21:59.740 --> 01:22:01.180]   was actually locked down somewhere.
[01:22:01.180 --> 01:22:02.900]   I'm guessing I'm not.
[01:22:02.900 --> 01:22:03.900]   I'm being bothered.
[01:22:03.900 --> 01:22:05.580]   We know that that's how they did the iPad ads.
[01:22:05.580 --> 01:22:07.860]   So anyway, here's cheese.
[01:22:07.860 --> 01:22:09.860]   Every picture tells a story.
[01:22:09.860 --> 01:22:10.940]   This is about the panel.
[01:22:10.940 --> 01:22:14.740]   Of course, some stories are bigger than others.
[01:22:14.740 --> 01:22:17.260]   I say the panel app works quite well better.
[01:22:17.260 --> 01:22:19.660]   I would say the Android version.
[01:22:19.660 --> 01:22:23.060]   Fast, it's pretty easy to use.
[01:22:23.060 --> 01:22:24.900]   Good job of stitching.
[01:22:24.900 --> 01:22:27.100]   It was incredible that I was stitching.
[01:22:27.100 --> 01:22:29.580]   Like when I saw it, I was like, there's no way it's going to work.
[01:22:29.580 --> 01:22:30.580]   Right.
[01:22:30.580 --> 01:22:31.580]   In real time.
[01:22:31.580 --> 01:22:32.580]   Right.
[01:22:32.580 --> 01:22:33.580]   Yeah.
[01:22:33.580 --> 01:22:34.580]   Got it.
[01:22:34.580 --> 01:22:38.060]   I think it's a wonderful implementation of the version of panorama stitching that we saw
[01:22:38.060 --> 01:22:41.140]   in Sony a couple of years ago.
[01:22:41.140 --> 01:22:42.140]   I'm sorry.
[01:22:42.140 --> 01:22:43.140]   It's the year.
[01:22:43.140 --> 01:22:44.140]   All right.
[01:22:44.140 --> 01:22:46.540]   This one, let's take a look at the physics.
[01:22:46.540 --> 01:22:53.700]   No, actually, I have the, that one I tested with not only auto stitch, but also an actual
[01:22:53.700 --> 01:22:55.540]   like 180 degree lens.
[01:22:55.540 --> 01:23:00.620]   And yeah, no, the panorama that you get from the iPhone from my iOS 6 on the iPhone 5 is
[01:23:00.620 --> 01:23:01.620]   just killer.
[01:23:01.620 --> 01:23:03.580]   And maybe I'll ask you about the cellics.
[01:23:03.580 --> 01:23:07.220]   One thing that I noticed in that ad they didn't, it wasn't, they weren't turning the
[01:23:07.220 --> 01:23:09.460]   phone as you would normally do with a panel.
[01:23:09.460 --> 01:23:12.700]   They were actually sliding it along.
[01:23:12.700 --> 01:23:13.700]   Which you shouldn't do.
[01:23:13.700 --> 01:23:16.260]   But they, but then I'm sure it looks better.
[01:23:16.260 --> 01:23:20.660]   It looks better on the, you don't think that was a, that was a, just for the purpose.
[01:23:20.660 --> 01:23:23.340]   I think, I think, I think that they had the kid.
[01:23:23.340 --> 01:23:26.980]   It looked like they had the kids actually arrange in the kind of a semi circle.
[01:23:26.980 --> 01:23:28.780]   It was like a plane line.
[01:23:28.780 --> 01:23:32.180]   So for that use, it looked like it would be the right way to do it.
[01:23:32.180 --> 01:23:34.460]   Were they, were they kids on a light stand?
[01:23:34.460 --> 01:23:36.900]   Let me, let me just try this here.
[01:23:36.900 --> 01:23:40.060]   So whoops.
[01:23:40.060 --> 01:23:41.340]   Move phone continue.
[01:23:41.340 --> 01:23:44.780]   See, it does, it does work if I just, oh no, it's very confused.
[01:23:44.780 --> 01:23:46.500]   Yeah, it doesn't, it doesn't like it.
[01:23:46.500 --> 01:23:47.500]   Doesn't like that at all.
[01:23:47.500 --> 01:23:49.820]   But come on, this is what they did in the advertisement.
[01:23:49.820 --> 01:23:53.580]   Well, it works great even on the iPhone 4s.
[01:23:53.580 --> 01:23:54.820]   All right.
[01:23:54.820 --> 01:23:56.500]   It comes with iOS 6, we should mention that.
[01:23:56.500 --> 01:23:58.700]   Yeah, it's not, it's for the all iOS 6.
[01:23:58.700 --> 01:24:01.740]   And for those, for those watching, I mean, the big thing is, is that if you're using this
[01:24:01.740 --> 01:24:04.780]   phone, what you want to do is you want the rotate around the axis.
[01:24:04.780 --> 01:24:10.180]   Yeah, you really want to be as close to the, to the, you know, pivot, to the pivot point
[01:24:10.180 --> 01:24:11.180]   here.
[01:24:11.180 --> 01:24:13.460]   So, so remember that the camera is in the corner.
[01:24:13.460 --> 01:24:14.540]   So pivot on the corner.
[01:24:14.540 --> 01:24:18.540]   So if you turn it, the closer you do that, it means it's a lot less important when you're
[01:24:18.540 --> 01:24:20.500]   outside and there's nothing near you.
[01:24:20.500 --> 01:24:24.100]   When you're near something like a table or this microphone or something like that, that's
[01:24:24.100 --> 01:24:26.740]   where you're going to see the parallax and things are going to get chopped up.
[01:24:26.740 --> 01:24:31.620]   Although what I will say is that so far all my tests have shown almost no shadowing, almost
[01:24:31.620 --> 01:24:35.940]   almost no ghosts, almost no, I mean, there's all like it, whatever they're doing, there's
[01:24:35.940 --> 01:24:38.300]   some serious magic going on inside of it.
[01:24:38.300 --> 01:24:42.660]   I'm able to get some surprisingly good panels in real time, which is one of the amazing
[01:24:42.660 --> 01:24:43.660]   thing.
[01:24:43.660 --> 01:24:44.660]   You can be technical.
[01:24:44.660 --> 01:24:46.980]   I'm talking about the technical issues, but the reality is, I mean, you just, just do
[01:24:46.980 --> 01:24:48.300]   it and it seems to work.
[01:24:48.300 --> 01:24:52.300]   My son took a panel and while we were driving and I said, well, that's not going to work.
[01:24:52.300 --> 01:24:54.340]   And it actually ended up working quite well.
[01:24:54.340 --> 01:24:57.700]   I mean, the stuff that was moving out the window didn't look so good, but you got a
[01:24:57.700 --> 01:25:01.300]   good panel of the inside of the car.
[01:25:01.300 --> 01:25:03.820]   It was just, it was the highway moving that was.
[01:25:03.820 --> 01:25:08.340]   I don't know what the flying highway.
[01:25:08.340 --> 01:25:09.340]   All right.
[01:25:09.340 --> 01:25:10.340]   This is a ad three.
[01:25:10.340 --> 01:25:11.340]   This is physics.
[01:25:11.340 --> 01:25:12.340]   What is this?
[01:25:12.340 --> 01:25:13.340]   Yeah, physics.
[01:25:13.340 --> 01:25:15.420]   I like playing ads.
[01:25:15.420 --> 01:25:17.740]   There are laws to physics, right?
[01:25:17.740 --> 01:25:22.620]   You see people recognize Jeff Daniels voice.
[01:25:22.620 --> 01:25:24.820]   How can something get bigger?
[01:25:24.820 --> 01:25:29.700]   He was a dumb and dumber and small and nooser.
[01:25:29.700 --> 01:25:30.700]   There's more of it.
[01:25:30.700 --> 01:25:33.100]   I like his voice and choice.
[01:25:33.100 --> 01:25:37.660]   Less of it and more of it and less of it.
[01:25:37.660 --> 01:25:44.300]   Well, I guess the laws of physics are more like general guidelines.
[01:25:44.300 --> 01:25:45.300]   The good ads.
[01:25:45.300 --> 01:25:46.300]   Yeah, the good.
[01:25:46.300 --> 01:25:47.300]   That genius ad.
[01:25:47.300 --> 01:25:48.300]   One more.
[01:25:48.300 --> 01:25:50.780]   This is the one that I meant to play originally.
[01:25:50.780 --> 01:25:55.340]   This is the one for the earbuds.
[01:25:55.340 --> 01:25:56.340]   Which by the way, I think are pretty good.
[01:25:56.340 --> 01:25:57.820]   I think the sound is better than the old ones.
[01:25:57.820 --> 01:25:59.620]   They shouldn't fit better than the old ones.
[01:25:59.620 --> 01:26:03.620]   The ears are weird.
[01:26:03.620 --> 01:26:09.020]   I don't know what shape that is, but it's not around.
[01:26:09.020 --> 01:26:11.860]   So why would headphones be around?
[01:26:11.860 --> 01:26:13.860]   Like our old headphones that we sold for new shapes.
[01:26:13.860 --> 01:26:14.860]   Like this.
[01:26:14.860 --> 01:26:15.860]   Yeah.
[01:26:15.860 --> 01:26:18.620]   Yeah, you're shaped headphones.
[01:26:18.620 --> 01:26:24.820]   You know, so they fit in your ears.
[01:26:24.820 --> 01:26:27.820]   And then plug into the bottom of the phone for reasons no one understands.
[01:26:27.820 --> 01:26:29.540]   So there's the ad.
[01:26:29.540 --> 01:26:33.180]   New ads for the iPhone 5.
[01:26:33.180 --> 01:26:37.220]   Thumbs, physics, cheese and ears.
[01:26:37.220 --> 01:26:39.060]   Anybody have any scratching on the anodized aluminum?
[01:26:39.060 --> 01:26:44.420]   You know, I ran an exacto knife across this and it was fine.
[01:26:44.420 --> 01:26:46.020]   So I think this is anodized.
[01:26:46.020 --> 01:26:47.740]   It's not painted now.
[01:26:47.740 --> 01:26:48.740]   Who was it?
[01:26:48.740 --> 01:26:52.180]   Was it I fix it that really they were able to gouge it.
[01:26:52.180 --> 01:26:53.180]   But speaking of physics.
[01:26:53.180 --> 01:26:54.380]   But they were using a chisel.
[01:26:54.380 --> 01:26:56.820]   Yeah, Apple has not repealed the laws of physics.
[01:26:56.820 --> 01:26:59.340]   It's still metal that you could gouge.
[01:26:59.340 --> 01:27:06.740]   So people forget that the iPhone 4 was made out of like aircraft glass and steel.
[01:27:06.740 --> 01:27:09.740]   These are difficult materials to scratch at all.
[01:27:09.740 --> 01:27:13.620]   Probably the toughest materials you can put the consumer device and they replace it with
[01:27:13.620 --> 01:27:15.020]   a very conventional material.
[01:27:15.020 --> 01:27:19.820]   And if you expected to have the superhuman paint on it that is going to completely just
[01:27:19.820 --> 01:27:22.540]   scratching, that's just that's unrealistic, sweetie.
[01:27:22.540 --> 01:27:25.780]   I mean, it's not going to be the bin.
[01:27:25.780 --> 01:27:26.780]   Just not going to happen.
[01:27:26.780 --> 01:27:30.180]   But in the chat room just said the reason they put the headphone jack on the bottom next
[01:27:30.180 --> 01:27:33.660]   to the lightning point is so that you could dock it onto something.
[01:27:33.660 --> 01:27:34.660]   Oh, no, I don't know.
[01:27:34.660 --> 01:27:35.660]   Oh, no, no.
[01:27:35.660 --> 01:27:40.660]   I think the reason why they did it is because when you're holding it, you basically the
[01:27:40.660 --> 01:27:44.780]   headphone goes basically up towards where your earphones actually are.
[01:27:44.780 --> 01:27:51.220]   Also does it look pretty to have when you have it both with the docking cable and with
[01:27:51.220 --> 01:27:55.540]   the earphones, it looks like a bead with this two bars coming in and out.
[01:27:55.540 --> 01:27:58.140]   Maybe it looks better with both them coming back down.
[01:27:58.140 --> 01:28:02.060]   Actually given that I often like when I take my constitutional, I'll have this in my hand.
[01:28:02.060 --> 01:28:05.180]   It is actually better, I think, to have the headphone jack on the bottom.
[01:28:05.180 --> 01:28:08.940]   As long as you're holding your hand, but don't put it in your pocket, then it's all screwed
[01:28:08.940 --> 01:28:09.940]   up.
[01:28:09.940 --> 01:28:11.500]   You have to put it upside down in your pocket.
[01:28:11.500 --> 01:28:15.220]   Now again, I don't know why that bugs me because I'm not looking at it.
[01:28:15.220 --> 01:28:16.860]   But it just bugs me out.
[01:28:16.860 --> 01:28:19.820]   It's upside down.
[01:28:19.820 --> 01:28:20.820]   It's upside down.
[01:28:20.820 --> 01:28:24.060]   The little people inside my phone are all standing on their heads.
[01:28:24.060 --> 01:28:25.060]   All right.
[01:28:25.060 --> 01:28:26.060]   How about this?
[01:28:26.060 --> 01:28:29.620]   You're using it outside and it's raining.
[01:28:29.620 --> 01:28:33.660]   Do you want a big hole on the top of it or do you want it on the bottom where they get
[01:28:33.660 --> 01:28:34.660]   into it?
[01:28:34.660 --> 01:28:37.940]   No, because the toe will be on the top because it's upside down in your pocket.
[01:28:37.940 --> 01:28:41.340]   Because you had to put the headphone in.
[01:28:41.340 --> 01:28:44.740]   Wozniak says he doesn't like the maps, but they'll get better.
[01:28:44.740 --> 01:28:45.740]   Steve is so great.
[01:28:45.740 --> 01:28:46.740]   I love Steve.
[01:28:46.740 --> 01:28:54.500]   Every time I see a quote from Steve, I hear his voice because he talks in his voice.
[01:28:54.500 --> 01:28:59.300]   He now says he wants to move to Australia because he likes the National Broadband Network
[01:28:59.300 --> 01:29:02.620]   in Australia so much.
[01:29:02.620 --> 01:29:04.020]   And he says, "Will he?"
[01:29:04.020 --> 01:29:07.380]   Yes, he wants to move to Australia.
[01:29:07.380 --> 01:29:11.380]   I have a feeling that Steve can get whatever speed or not he wants wherever he happens to
[01:29:11.380 --> 01:29:12.380]   be at any given moment.
[01:29:12.380 --> 01:29:13.380]   I'm not sure if it needs you.
[01:29:13.380 --> 01:29:14.380]   You've asked to move.
[01:29:14.380 --> 01:29:16.580]   He moved.
[01:29:16.580 --> 01:29:22.620]   He had a very nice house in, I think it was in Saratoga, Los Gatos that he built a cave
[01:29:22.620 --> 01:29:25.420]   in for his son and all sorts of stuff.
[01:29:25.420 --> 01:29:26.420]   And he left.
[01:29:26.420 --> 01:29:29.100]   He moved because he couldn't get good cell reception.
[01:29:29.100 --> 01:29:30.740]   He sold the house.
[01:29:30.740 --> 01:29:33.220]   So I begged to differ.
[01:29:33.220 --> 01:29:34.420]   I don't know that he's a geek or anything.
[01:29:34.420 --> 01:29:37.620]   You would think he could have called AT&T and said, "Could you put a cell site outside
[01:29:37.620 --> 01:29:38.620]   my house?"
[01:29:38.620 --> 01:29:39.820]   That's how nice he is.
[01:29:39.820 --> 01:29:41.340]   He doesn't like to make trouble.
[01:29:41.340 --> 01:29:42.340]   You know what?
[01:29:42.340 --> 01:29:43.980]   That's exactly right.
[01:29:43.980 --> 01:29:47.060]   You're joking, but exactly, I'm sure Steve said, "Well, I'm not going to call them.
[01:29:47.060 --> 01:29:49.060]   I'm just going to move."
[01:29:49.060 --> 01:29:50.060]   By the way, those two...
[01:29:50.060 --> 01:29:51.060]   Australia.
[01:29:51.060 --> 01:29:52.060]   To Australia.
[01:29:52.060 --> 01:29:53.060]   Or Australia.
[01:29:53.060 --> 01:29:54.060]   Australia.
[01:29:54.060 --> 01:29:55.060]   Or Australia.
[01:29:55.060 --> 01:29:56.220]   To be the greatest people on Earth.
[01:29:56.220 --> 01:29:57.220]   I agree.
[01:29:57.220 --> 01:29:58.660]   They're the friendliest, the nicest.
[01:29:58.660 --> 01:30:02.740]   Alternately, what do you think is going to be easier packing up everything you own and
[01:30:02.740 --> 01:30:05.180]   moving to a new house or dealing with AT&T customers?
[01:30:05.180 --> 01:30:06.180]   Yeah, that's a good point.
[01:30:06.180 --> 01:30:08.180]   One of the money I'd probably move.
[01:30:08.180 --> 01:30:10.180]   Yeah, you're right.
[01:30:10.180 --> 01:30:12.100]   And I'm so happy to hear.
[01:30:12.100 --> 01:30:16.460]   I don't know if this bodes anything, but you remember that Google bought Sparrow, which
[01:30:16.460 --> 01:30:17.460]   made me sad.
[01:30:17.460 --> 01:30:20.180]   It made my lower lip tremble because I like it.
[01:30:20.180 --> 01:30:24.700]   It's an email client for the iOS and for the desktop.
[01:30:24.700 --> 01:30:26.980]   I use it on the desktop.
[01:30:26.980 --> 01:30:27.980]   And so good news.
[01:30:27.980 --> 01:30:32.220]   They have decided that they're going to update Sparrow to support the bigger screen on the
[01:30:32.220 --> 01:30:35.060]   iPhone 5.
[01:30:35.060 --> 01:30:36.300]   I may be the last time.
[01:30:36.300 --> 01:30:39.420]   I don't know.
[01:30:39.420 --> 01:30:42.340]   But one more update still to come from Sparrow.
[01:30:42.340 --> 01:30:43.340]   How hard...
[01:30:43.340 --> 01:30:44.340]   It can't be...
[01:30:44.340 --> 01:30:47.140]   For most apps, like a tech space app like that, it's probably fairly easy to do.
[01:30:47.140 --> 01:30:51.100]   If it's field runners, too, it's going to be a lot harder to make it wide screen because
[01:30:51.100 --> 01:30:53.780]   you have to redo all the art.
[01:30:53.780 --> 01:30:54.780]   Right?
[01:30:54.780 --> 01:30:55.780]   Yeah.
[01:30:55.780 --> 01:30:58.220]   So don't expect field runners to wide screen.
[01:30:58.220 --> 01:30:59.220]   It's pretty great.
[01:30:59.220 --> 01:31:00.220]   Just the way it is.
[01:31:00.220 --> 01:31:01.220]   I know.
[01:31:01.220 --> 01:31:02.220]   I love that app.
[01:31:02.220 --> 01:31:03.220]   I love that app.
[01:31:03.220 --> 01:31:04.220]   It's such a good...
[01:31:04.220 --> 01:31:06.220]   You know what's on the iPad now?
[01:31:06.220 --> 01:31:08.780]   Yeah, but the problem is I have trouble syncing it.
[01:31:08.780 --> 01:31:09.780]   I've already gotten all of them.
[01:31:09.780 --> 01:31:10.780]   I know.
[01:31:10.780 --> 01:31:11.780]   I've won everything.
[01:31:11.780 --> 01:31:12.780]   So I've been started.
[01:31:12.780 --> 01:31:13.780]   I've won all of them.
[01:31:13.780 --> 01:31:14.780]   So now I'm trying to go through the point...
[01:31:14.780 --> 01:31:15.780]   How many stars?
[01:31:15.780 --> 01:31:16.780]   One of them.
[01:31:16.780 --> 01:31:18.300]   I've just gotten a couple of them, one on most of them.
[01:31:18.300 --> 01:31:19.780]   I've just gotten through them.
[01:31:19.780 --> 01:31:20.780]   Now I'm going up.
[01:31:20.780 --> 01:31:22.060]   Now I've got to get three stars on all of them.
[01:31:22.060 --> 01:31:23.060]   Three is hard.
[01:31:23.060 --> 01:31:24.060]   I try to do tough.
[01:31:24.060 --> 01:31:26.620]   You see, you have casual, tough, and heroic.
[01:31:26.620 --> 01:31:27.620]   And I try to do tough.
[01:31:27.620 --> 01:31:32.100]   And they remind you over and over again, like a taunt, that all of them can be won in heroic
[01:31:32.100 --> 01:31:33.100]   mode.
[01:31:33.100 --> 01:31:34.100]   It's hard to believe.
[01:31:34.100 --> 01:31:36.100]   I have a hard time winning them in casual.
[01:31:36.100 --> 01:31:37.100]   In casual.
[01:31:37.100 --> 01:31:38.100]   I know.
[01:31:38.100 --> 01:31:39.100]   This should be our thing.
[01:31:39.100 --> 01:31:40.940]   But you know what happens is you play it.
[01:31:40.940 --> 01:31:41.940]   Here's the thing.
[01:31:41.940 --> 01:31:42.940]   Here's the thing is that you play it.
[01:31:42.940 --> 01:31:45.460]   You play it one over and over and over again.
[01:31:45.460 --> 01:31:50.180]   And what happens for me is that I wake up in the morning and I know exactly how to...
[01:31:50.180 --> 01:31:51.180]   It comes to you.
[01:31:51.180 --> 01:31:54.500]   Yeah, like, oh, you know, exactly what I need to do.
[01:31:54.500 --> 01:31:55.500]   And then you just pound it.
[01:31:55.500 --> 01:31:58.180]   Oh, I should have done something.
[01:31:58.180 --> 01:31:59.500]   Yeah, if I just...
[01:31:59.500 --> 01:32:02.420]   You know, they're supposed to sync up through game center to your...
[01:32:02.420 --> 01:32:03.780]   But that doesn't work.
[01:32:03.780 --> 01:32:04.780]   Yeah.
[01:32:04.780 --> 01:32:06.220]   So this is a hard one.
[01:32:06.220 --> 01:32:09.140]   It looks like it would be easy because you've got these...
[01:32:09.140 --> 01:32:11.340]   They have to come down the trough.
[01:32:11.340 --> 01:32:13.980]   So you could like corner them in the trough, right?
[01:32:13.980 --> 01:32:15.740]   But it's not easy to do with them all over at the same time.
[01:32:15.740 --> 01:32:18.180]   You really need flamethrowers in there because that way they...
[01:32:18.180 --> 01:32:19.180]   Flame throwers.
[01:32:19.180 --> 01:32:20.180]   That's how we run World War...
[01:32:20.180 --> 01:32:21.180]   Got it.
[01:32:21.180 --> 01:32:22.180]   WW2.
[01:32:22.180 --> 01:32:24.980]   Like as soon as you get a fortum, you need the flamethrowers in there because then that
[01:32:24.980 --> 01:32:28.500]   pinches them and they're an area attack.
[01:32:28.500 --> 01:32:29.500]   Not individual.
[01:32:29.500 --> 01:32:32.060]   The problem with those, they're individual.
[01:32:32.060 --> 01:32:34.140]   We need to do a field runners show.
[01:32:34.140 --> 01:32:35.140]   I'm all with that.
[01:32:35.140 --> 01:32:36.140]   This weekend field runners.
[01:32:36.140 --> 01:32:38.180]   We could probably do that for a year.
[01:32:38.180 --> 01:32:39.180]   This is such a good game.
[01:32:39.180 --> 01:32:41.940]   I'll put it fast forward so that we can see some action here.
[01:32:41.940 --> 01:32:44.420]   I need some oil to slow them down.
[01:32:44.420 --> 01:32:45.420]   They're getting faster.
[01:32:45.420 --> 01:32:46.420]   Look at that.
[01:32:46.420 --> 01:32:47.420]   Oh, I need it.
[01:32:47.420 --> 01:32:48.420]   What do I need?
[01:32:48.420 --> 01:32:50.340]   Well, I put a missile launcher in that center one.
[01:32:50.340 --> 01:32:51.340]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:32:51.340 --> 01:32:53.060]   Oh, it's getting dug.
[01:32:53.060 --> 01:32:54.060]   See, they escaped.
[01:32:54.060 --> 01:32:55.060]   It's just a few.
[01:32:55.060 --> 01:32:56.060]   I get 20.
[01:32:56.060 --> 01:32:57.060]   No.
[01:32:57.060 --> 01:32:58.060]   You don't want any to get through?
[01:32:58.060 --> 01:32:59.900]   You shouldn't lose any until like level 40.
[01:32:59.900 --> 01:33:03.300]   If you lose any before level 40, you're going to get it.
[01:33:03.300 --> 01:33:04.460]   I'm already dead, right?
[01:33:04.460 --> 01:33:05.460]   It's over.
[01:33:05.460 --> 01:33:06.460]   I blew it.
[01:33:06.460 --> 01:33:07.460]   Do you like to upgrade?
[01:33:07.460 --> 01:33:08.820]   They encourage you to upgrade.
[01:33:08.820 --> 01:33:10.580]   I upgrade them at the very beginning.
[01:33:10.580 --> 01:33:11.900]   No, no, I wouldn't do that many.
[01:33:11.900 --> 01:33:12.900]   Because now you're just wasting money.
[01:33:12.900 --> 01:33:13.900]   You just throw them away.
[01:33:13.900 --> 01:33:20.380]   You've got to get to the big guns fast so that you can-- because the key is you want
[01:33:20.380 --> 01:33:21.380]   to overpower them.
[01:33:21.380 --> 01:33:22.540]   It's a surprisingly challenging game.
[01:33:22.540 --> 01:33:24.020]   See, now I get some oil.
[01:33:24.020 --> 01:33:25.020]   That's good.
[01:33:25.020 --> 01:33:26.020]   I wanted the oil.
[01:33:26.020 --> 01:33:27.180]   So I can slow them down.
[01:33:27.180 --> 01:33:28.180]   Those sons of guns.
[01:33:28.180 --> 01:33:29.180]   And spin all that money on their own.
[01:33:29.180 --> 01:33:30.180]   Get in the oil.
[01:33:30.180 --> 01:33:31.180]   Get in the oil.
[01:33:31.180 --> 01:33:32.180]   You would have had a flame thrower.
[01:33:32.180 --> 01:33:34.180]   And then everything would have been fine.
[01:33:34.180 --> 01:33:35.180]   Flame thrower.
[01:33:35.180 --> 01:33:36.180]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:33:36.180 --> 01:33:37.180]   That's the secret.
[01:33:37.180 --> 01:33:38.820]   You know, they just come running up.
[01:33:38.820 --> 01:33:39.820]   They don't know what's happening.
[01:33:39.820 --> 01:33:40.820]   It's like, boom.
[01:33:40.820 --> 01:33:42.540]   And they're a little toast.
[01:33:42.540 --> 01:33:45.220]   You know, and then another set runs out.
[01:33:45.220 --> 01:33:46.220]   And then it goes, boom.
[01:33:46.220 --> 01:33:48.220]   And then there's only a couple of them.
[01:33:48.220 --> 01:33:50.020]   They pop when they cook.
[01:33:50.020 --> 01:33:51.420]   And they don't pop, but they should.
[01:33:51.420 --> 01:33:52.420]   That was really cool.
[01:33:52.420 --> 01:33:53.420]   They should.
[01:33:53.420 --> 01:33:56.100]   What should happen is they should all sit there and they should just be like charred
[01:33:56.100 --> 01:33:57.100]   and fall over.
[01:33:57.100 --> 01:33:58.180]   We're going to take a break.
[01:33:58.180 --> 01:34:00.260]   You can play some load runners.
[01:34:00.260 --> 01:34:03.660]   I mean, start field runners while we take a break.
[01:34:03.660 --> 01:34:05.380]   On your old iPhone 4S.
[01:34:05.380 --> 01:34:09.380]   Still works well for field runners.
[01:34:09.380 --> 01:34:11.380]   The field runner server now.
[01:34:11.380 --> 01:34:14.820]   Hey, Andy, have you played with the whisper sync now in Audible?
[01:34:14.820 --> 01:34:16.300]   Because I'm loving that.
[01:34:16.300 --> 01:34:17.300]   Yeah.
[01:34:17.300 --> 01:34:18.300]   Yeah.
[01:34:18.300 --> 01:34:22.700]   I mean, the only disadvantage of it is that now it makes me actually buy both copies of
[01:34:22.700 --> 01:34:23.700]   it now.
[01:34:23.700 --> 01:34:28.940]   So it's always been like this line of demarcation between the books that I listened to and
[01:34:28.940 --> 01:34:30.860]   then a totally separate books that I read.
[01:34:30.860 --> 01:34:35.460]   Now it's like, if I had a really interesting part of a book that I'm reading, I have to
[01:34:35.460 --> 01:34:37.860]   say, oh, but I've got like a two hour drive.
[01:34:37.860 --> 01:34:38.860]   Oh.
[01:34:38.860 --> 01:34:39.860]   I'm not going to buy the Audible book.
[01:34:39.860 --> 01:34:44.260]   But you know, if it's whisper sync enabled, they give you a deal on the Audible book.
[01:34:44.260 --> 01:34:46.900]   So you kind of get a price cut.
[01:34:46.900 --> 01:34:47.900]   Right?
[01:34:47.900 --> 01:34:53.820]   Yes, but you know, I'm a print journalist in the collapsing market.
[01:34:53.820 --> 01:34:56.180]   So even that's not enough.
[01:34:56.180 --> 01:35:00.620]   So the whisper sync has been around Amazon bought Audible a couple of years ago.
[01:35:00.620 --> 01:35:04.420]   Whisper sync's been around for a while in your Kindle books where you would buy a book,
[01:35:04.420 --> 01:35:07.300]   read it on a different devices because that's the nice thing about the Kindle software.
[01:35:07.300 --> 01:35:10.740]   You can have it on your Kindle on an iPad and an iPhone and it would just jump you to
[01:35:10.740 --> 01:35:13.180]   wherever you left off no matter what device you're reading it on.
[01:35:13.180 --> 01:35:16.580]   And we always said, gosh, if Audible would only do that, well, now they do.
[01:35:16.580 --> 01:35:19.340]   If you use the Audible app, it will keep track of where you are.
[01:35:19.340 --> 01:35:22.460]   If you're listening on your iPhone and you get home and you start listening on your iPad,
[01:35:22.460 --> 01:35:23.700]   no problem.
[01:35:23.700 --> 01:35:27.940]   And it works with the, with Andy's talking about with the Kindle version as well.
[01:35:27.940 --> 01:35:32.420]   So if you're, you're, let's say you're reading at home on your Kindle on the text, then you
[01:35:32.420 --> 01:35:35.460]   get in the car and you want to listen to Audible, jumps right to that part.
[01:35:35.460 --> 01:35:36.460]   And it's really cool.
[01:35:36.460 --> 01:35:40.260]   And this would be, this is of limited use, but I think somebody, if you had dyslexic kids
[01:35:40.260 --> 01:35:46.380]   or there's a lot of, this would be very helpful to teach kids to read even if you have a Kindle
[01:35:46.380 --> 01:35:47.380]   device.
[01:35:47.380 --> 01:35:51.180]   I think this works with a Kindle Fire only maybe when you're listening, when you're reading
[01:35:51.180 --> 01:35:55.340]   a book in text, you can also play the audio and it will highlight the words as they read
[01:35:55.340 --> 01:35:57.260]   them, which is really cool.
[01:35:57.260 --> 01:35:58.420]   That's on the Kindle Fire.
[01:35:58.420 --> 01:36:00.900]   Anyway, Audible, I should tell you what Audible is.
[01:36:00.900 --> 01:36:03.740]   Audible is the best darn bookstore ever.
[01:36:03.740 --> 01:36:09.140]   Audio books, over a hundred thousand read by really good, not, you know, bad readers,
[01:36:09.140 --> 01:36:13.100]   but people, actors for the most part, Broadway actors in many cases, who can bring a book
[01:36:13.100 --> 01:36:14.820]   to life.
[01:36:14.820 --> 01:36:19.140]   And if you have kind of, I was just talking to somebody who kind of, you know, love to
[01:36:19.140 --> 01:36:21.100]   read, but who has time anymore?
[01:36:21.100 --> 01:36:24.780]   And you know, you get in bed and you start to read, you get about a paragraph and you've
[01:36:24.780 --> 01:36:26.620]   got this is the solution.
[01:36:26.620 --> 01:36:29.020]   I told her, oh, you kind of get audio books.
[01:36:29.020 --> 01:36:32.420]   Now you can listen to the gym, you can listen in your commute, listen to that when you're
[01:36:32.420 --> 01:36:35.700]   walking the dog, I listen all the time.
[01:36:35.700 --> 01:36:39.940]   And I get a couple of hours a book of reading a day without any, without breaking a sweat.
[01:36:39.940 --> 01:36:42.860]   Well, actually I'm breaking a sweat because I'm at the gym.
[01:36:42.860 --> 01:36:43.860]   Audible.com.
[01:36:43.860 --> 01:36:46.500]   Now I'm going to tell you how you can get your first book for you.
[01:36:46.500 --> 01:36:49.620]   There's a new section, 10 books you won't want to put down.
[01:36:49.620 --> 01:36:50.620]   Ready Player One?
[01:36:50.620 --> 01:36:51.620]   Yay.
[01:36:51.620 --> 01:36:54.100]   That's the Will Wheaton Red.
[01:36:54.100 --> 01:36:55.100]   The help.
[01:36:55.100 --> 01:36:56.100]   That was excellent.
[01:36:56.100 --> 01:36:58.820]   Rob Lowe's autobiography.
[01:36:58.820 --> 01:36:59.820]   Oh man.
[01:36:59.820 --> 01:37:00.820]   Life of Pi.
[01:37:00.820 --> 01:37:05.580]   That one of the best life of Pi versions there listening to it is really brings it to life.
[01:37:05.580 --> 01:37:06.580]   So these are good.
[01:37:06.580 --> 01:37:07.580]   This is some recommendations.
[01:37:07.580 --> 01:37:12.540]   Audible is like a real bookstore in the sense that they do a lot of things like bookstores
[01:37:12.540 --> 01:37:15.060]   do like, you know, here's our favorites.
[01:37:15.060 --> 01:37:17.260]   Here's, hey, are you really interested in this kind of book?
[01:37:17.260 --> 01:37:18.260]   Here's another one.
[01:37:18.260 --> 01:37:20.500]   Discover a brilliant new dystopian fantasy.
[01:37:20.500 --> 01:37:22.740]   I'm a big fan of those.
[01:37:22.740 --> 01:37:24.820]   You know what the number one in book is right now.
[01:37:24.820 --> 01:37:27.740]   This is actually going to put this on my list.
[01:37:27.740 --> 01:37:28.740]   No easy day.
[01:37:28.740 --> 01:37:33.500]   The first hand account of the mission that killed Osama bin Laden by one of the SEAL Team
[01:37:33.500 --> 01:37:34.500]   Six guys.
[01:37:34.500 --> 01:37:36.980]   I've been meaning to add that to my cart.
[01:37:36.980 --> 01:37:39.500]   See, I have an Audible subscription.
[01:37:39.500 --> 01:37:43.300]   So I get credits every month to spend and we'd like to invite you to try it.
[01:37:43.300 --> 01:37:44.300]   Your first month's free.
[01:37:44.300 --> 01:37:49.220]   If you go to audible.com/macbreak, you'll be signing up for the gold account.
[01:37:49.220 --> 01:37:50.380]   That's a credit a month.
[01:37:50.380 --> 01:37:52.100]   Most books are a single credit.
[01:37:52.100 --> 01:37:53.100]   You pick any book.
[01:37:53.100 --> 01:37:54.100]   Listen to it.
[01:37:54.100 --> 01:37:56.700]   You get canceled anytime, pay nothing if you choose.
[01:37:56.700 --> 01:37:59.540]   And the book is still yours to keep forever.
[01:37:59.540 --> 01:38:01.700]   Andy, you got to, I know you have an Audible recommendation.
[01:38:01.700 --> 01:38:02.700]   You were asking.
[01:38:02.700 --> 01:38:05.740]   Yeah, I got one that I've been saving up for like two and a half months.
[01:38:05.740 --> 01:38:10.260]   A fantastic new book just got released today and also released in Audible.
[01:38:10.260 --> 01:38:14.460]   It's called The Dangerous Animals Club by Stephen Tuboloski.
[01:38:14.460 --> 01:38:18.980]   And you know, Stephen Tuboloski is one of those character actors.
[01:38:18.980 --> 01:38:24.060]   He's one of those, one of the upper echelon guys because he's identified as, oh, I'm
[01:38:24.060 --> 01:38:25.060]   a fan of the show.
[01:38:25.060 --> 01:38:26.060]   Oh, that guy.
[01:38:26.060 --> 01:38:31.780]   If you, the annoying insurance salesman in Groundhog Day, like middle nose, I love him.
[01:38:31.780 --> 01:38:32.780]   I love him.
[01:38:32.780 --> 01:38:33.780]   I know who he is.
[01:38:33.780 --> 01:38:35.980]   He was in Ble, he was in sneakers.
[01:38:35.980 --> 01:38:39.620]   He was in like, he's been in like a million movies and TV shows.
[01:38:39.620 --> 01:38:43.900]   And he is an absolute master storyteller.
[01:38:43.900 --> 01:38:47.380]   He spins these essays based on events in his life.
[01:38:47.380 --> 01:38:50.980]   It's autobiographical, but it's not like one of these.
[01:38:50.980 --> 01:38:57.580]   And then I saw Diane Cannon face down in an aquarium full of cocaine.
[01:38:57.580 --> 01:38:59.900]   I asked Debbie Reynolds, who invited her?
[01:38:59.900 --> 01:39:01.900]   No, it's that guy.
[01:39:01.900 --> 01:39:02.900]   That guy.
[01:39:02.900 --> 01:39:06.660]   He's had an interesting life in the theater in movies and television.
[01:39:06.660 --> 01:39:08.700]   He's not a celebrity story.
[01:39:08.700 --> 01:39:09.700]   It's about people.
[01:39:09.700 --> 01:39:11.100]   He's so good in California.
[01:39:11.100 --> 01:39:12.100]   Cation.
[01:39:12.100 --> 01:39:14.540]   He's the movie director, husband.
[01:39:14.540 --> 01:39:19.780]   But the point I want to make is that it's not like I've recommended a bunch of Hollywood
[01:39:19.780 --> 01:39:22.060]   like books before and it's about the dick Van Dyke.
[01:39:22.060 --> 01:39:23.380]   You want to know what it was?
[01:39:23.380 --> 01:39:26.700]   Was he really totally drunk during during the comments?
[01:39:26.700 --> 01:39:27.700]   This isn't that kind of book.
[01:39:27.700 --> 01:39:32.780]   He has that rare ability, not only to tell a fantastic story, but also to look back on
[01:39:32.780 --> 01:39:38.180]   events from 10, 20, 30 years previously in his life, even a year previously in his life
[01:39:38.180 --> 01:39:41.780]   with perspective and a certain amount of insight.
[01:39:41.780 --> 01:39:46.540]   And every when he tells a story about falling off a horse and breaking his neck, it's not
[01:39:46.540 --> 01:39:49.300]   it really is a universal story about it.
[01:39:49.300 --> 01:39:50.940]   Here is what change in life is about.
[01:39:50.940 --> 01:39:53.180]   Here is what surprise is.
[01:39:53.180 --> 01:40:00.700]   And it's it's I've had a pre I got a proof copy of it a couple of months ago.
[01:40:00.700 --> 01:40:04.180]   And then I just I went right through it and then went right through it again.
[01:40:04.180 --> 01:40:07.540]   He has a fantastic first heard about his storytelling abilities.
[01:40:07.540 --> 01:40:12.300]   He has another podcast called the the double Stephen Tomlowski files, which I hardly recommend
[01:40:12.300 --> 01:40:15.300]   you seek out and subscribe to this.
[01:40:15.300 --> 01:40:16.300]   And it's not.
[01:40:16.300 --> 01:40:19.780]   Again, these and these aren't like off the cuff, like I've got an hour to fill, I'll
[01:40:19.780 --> 01:40:21.020]   start talking there.
[01:40:21.020 --> 01:40:26.820]   Well read, well written, just in trend there really is those driveway moments where I've
[01:40:26.820 --> 01:40:30.180]   been listening to I've been listening to an episode of the podcast and I'm in the driveway
[01:40:30.180 --> 01:40:35.100]   and just running down battery because I got to sit for the next 25 minutes to hear the
[01:40:35.100 --> 01:40:38.900]   story about Stevie Ray Vaughan and not not only just the story about him being in a band
[01:40:38.900 --> 01:40:44.380]   with Stevie Ray Vaughan, but also what he's learned and what what what lessons he's called
[01:40:44.380 --> 01:40:47.180]   from that experience just absolutely.
[01:40:47.180 --> 01:40:49.980]   He was in a band with Stevie Ray Vaughan.
[01:40:49.980 --> 01:40:51.340]   He's led a very interesting life.
[01:40:51.340 --> 01:40:57.900]   There was I got to I was rereading it on the beach and like about a month ago and I got
[01:40:57.900 --> 01:41:01.700]   to and you realize that you know Stephen Tomlowski by you know his the characters he plays sort
[01:41:01.700 --> 01:41:04.740]   of like a lot of these like sort of nerdy, nebishly guys.
[01:41:04.740 --> 01:41:05.740]   Right.
[01:41:05.740 --> 01:41:08.940]   And so when you get to this page about him throwing this incredible Hollywood party where
[01:41:08.940 --> 01:41:13.660]   most of these most of these stories have been again very sweet, very gentle stories about
[01:41:13.660 --> 01:41:18.020]   how I then and then the porn stars started arriving and started taking off their clothes
[01:41:18.020 --> 01:41:21.140]   and suddenly everybody put down their beers and moved into the bedroom.
[01:41:21.140 --> 01:41:22.140]   Wow.
[01:41:22.140 --> 01:41:28.060]   Hey Stephen, Steve then let me play a little bit of let me play a little bit of this book
[01:41:28.060 --> 01:41:32.220]   so that people can hear what it sounds like because he narrates it.
[01:41:32.220 --> 01:41:33.220]   Yes.
[01:41:33.220 --> 01:41:34.220]   And you'll recognize his voice.
[01:41:34.220 --> 01:41:36.820]   Somebody said he's the voice of the discover card commercials.
[01:41:36.820 --> 01:41:41.900]   Oh, what did I do with it here?
[01:41:41.900 --> 01:41:43.900]   He's so good.
[01:41:43.900 --> 01:41:48.540]   I've not only bought not only am I buying his book legitimately not only do I listen to
[01:41:48.540 --> 01:41:53.180]   his podcast but he was in Boston giving a reading in Harvard Square and I had to go out
[01:41:53.180 --> 01:41:54.900]   and see him read live.
[01:41:54.900 --> 01:41:57.420]   I'm not seeing I'm not a huge fan.
[01:41:57.420 --> 01:42:00.780]   Dangerous Animals Club here Stephen Tomlowski reading a little bit of that.
[01:42:00.780 --> 01:42:03.260]   Ask me how are the kids.
[01:42:03.260 --> 01:42:05.300]   I never have any idea.
[01:42:05.300 --> 01:42:09.740]   I know they eat and get dressed and go to school but as to what is going on in their
[01:42:09.740 --> 01:42:13.060]   lives and in their heads forget it.
[01:42:13.060 --> 01:42:14.900]   It is the secret world.
[01:42:14.900 --> 01:42:19.260]   The world that every child has that no parent gets to see.
[01:42:19.260 --> 01:42:20.260]   That's good.
[01:42:20.260 --> 01:42:21.260]   I can't wait to this is great.
[01:42:21.260 --> 01:42:25.460]   I just added it to my my cue of a book to listen to.
[01:42:25.460 --> 01:42:31.620]   Stephen Tomlowski it so here's the deal you can get this for free folks go to audible.com/macbreak

[01:42:44.220 --> 01:42:49.700]   He was he the teacher in freaky Friday probably that's exactly the kind of role.
[01:42:49.700 --> 01:42:53.940]   If you actually don't make sure that your laptop is plugged into battery before you
[01:42:53.940 --> 01:42:57.700]   access his IMDB page because that's because there's going to be a lot of scrolling involved
[01:42:57.700 --> 01:43:00.140]   to get to get to that.
[01:43:00.140 --> 01:43:05.060]   I can't wait I love that kind of Hollywood memoir but but but an interesting smart guy
[01:43:05.060 --> 01:43:10.320]   it's it's more life stories and life lessons but but sort of like hidden as interesting
[01:43:10.320 --> 01:43:13.380]   stories about a very very very very creative life.
[01:43:13.380 --> 01:43:14.380]   Yeah.
[01:43:14.380 --> 01:43:15.380]   Yeah.
[01:43:15.380 --> 01:43:18.900]   All right time for our I don't know should we do an iOS 6 tip of the week do you would
[01:43:18.900 --> 01:43:21.020]   you like to do it you don't have iOS 6 yet.
[01:43:21.020 --> 01:43:22.020]   I have.
[01:43:22.020 --> 01:43:23.020]   I was playing field runners.
[01:43:23.020 --> 01:43:24.020]   I was going to show you.
[01:43:24.020 --> 01:43:25.020]   Yeah.
[01:43:25.020 --> 01:43:26.020]   Here's our tip.
[01:43:26.020 --> 01:43:27.020]   Here's our field runners here.
[01:43:27.020 --> 01:43:28.020]   There we go.
[01:43:28.020 --> 01:43:29.020]   So there you go.
[01:43:29.020 --> 01:43:30.020]   He is set up on that same one thing.
[01:43:30.020 --> 01:43:36.100]   He's a flamour with properly with properly with oil with properly spaced missiles.
[01:43:36.100 --> 01:43:37.100]   Yeah.
[01:43:37.100 --> 01:43:38.100]   Yeah.
[01:43:38.100 --> 01:43:39.100]   Not a chance.
[01:43:39.100 --> 01:43:40.900]   The mistake I made was I put the flamethrower's both on the same side which is I've lost a
[01:43:40.900 --> 01:43:41.900]   couple of helicopters that way.
[01:43:41.900 --> 01:43:42.900]   Oh yeah.
[01:43:42.900 --> 01:43:43.900]   Because you want to get both.
[01:43:43.900 --> 01:43:46.060]   But you see you pinch them all and then I got a little lightning there and that's
[01:43:46.060 --> 01:43:47.820]   going to have a show that tanks get through.
[01:43:47.820 --> 01:43:48.820]   Oh my gosh.
[01:43:48.820 --> 01:43:51.460]   I don't so I need to have I need to have something slowing it down to the back there.
[01:43:51.460 --> 01:43:52.980]   I gave up 10 points there.
[01:43:52.980 --> 01:43:53.980]   40.
[01:43:53.980 --> 01:43:54.980]   Yeah.
[01:43:54.980 --> 01:43:55.980]   Yeah.
[01:43:55.980 --> 01:43:56.980]   Majority round 48 on this one.
[01:43:56.980 --> 01:43:57.980]   Yeah.
[01:43:57.980 --> 01:43:59.980]   You get them into that you get them into that you slow them down and then.
[01:43:59.980 --> 01:44:03.020]   I wish when you sprayed them with oil it would catch on fire from the flamethrower.
[01:44:03.020 --> 01:44:04.020]   It would be awesome.
[01:44:04.020 --> 01:44:05.020]   That would be awesome.
[01:44:05.020 --> 01:44:06.020]   Yeah.
[01:44:06.020 --> 01:44:07.020]   That's an in-app purchase.
[01:44:07.020 --> 01:44:10.140]   I would buy that in that purchase.
[01:44:10.140 --> 01:44:11.620]   So there's our iOS tip.
[01:44:11.620 --> 01:44:12.780]   There's my iOS tip.
[01:44:12.780 --> 01:44:19.180]   This is this is proper proper use of flamethrowers in pinch points and flamethrowers.
[01:44:19.180 --> 01:44:20.180]   Yes.
[01:44:20.180 --> 01:44:23.180]   Well you taught me everything I know about field runners I learned from Alex Lindsay.
[01:44:23.180 --> 01:44:24.180]   He's the king.
[01:44:24.180 --> 01:44:25.180]   I'm not that I'm obsessive.
[01:44:25.180 --> 01:44:26.820]   Have you ever seen me in a line in the airport?
[01:44:26.820 --> 01:44:27.820]   I'm always down in the flamethrower.
[01:44:27.820 --> 01:44:29.540]   That's how that's the only way to put up a crisp.
[01:44:29.540 --> 01:44:32.420]   Chris Breen you have a tip you want to give us.
[01:44:32.420 --> 01:44:37.100]   You're the Mac Daddy author of the Mac 911 column and Macworld.com.
[01:44:37.100 --> 01:44:40.020]   I mean no one knows more about this than you do.
[01:44:40.020 --> 01:44:41.140]   I will give you a tip.
[01:44:41.140 --> 01:44:43.060]   So you're using a mountain line.
[01:44:43.060 --> 01:44:44.060]   Yeah.
[01:44:44.060 --> 01:44:45.060]   I am.
[01:44:45.060 --> 01:44:46.060]   Oh.
[01:44:46.060 --> 01:44:47.060]   And you freeze.
[01:44:47.060 --> 01:44:48.060]   No.
[01:44:48.060 --> 01:44:49.060]   That's not right.
[01:44:49.060 --> 01:44:50.060]   That's just me.
[01:44:50.060 --> 01:44:51.060]   That's not right.
[01:44:51.060 --> 01:44:53.460]   You freeze with a funny look on your face.
[01:44:53.460 --> 01:44:54.460]   Oh.
[01:44:54.460 --> 01:44:56.860]   Field runners two by the way.
[01:44:56.860 --> 01:44:58.660]   Field runners two never.
[01:44:58.660 --> 01:45:02.140]   Field runners one was incredible until the winners two came out.
[01:45:02.140 --> 01:45:04.100]   I can't wait to see plants in zombies too.
[01:45:04.100 --> 01:45:05.700]   Is there a plants in zombies too?
[01:45:05.700 --> 01:45:06.780]   You there's gotta be a man.
[01:45:06.780 --> 01:45:07.780]   It's so much money on the first one.
[01:45:07.780 --> 01:45:13.940]   How can you not listen to this from web 3863 in all caps?
[01:45:13.940 --> 01:45:14.940]   No, no, I'm sorry.
[01:45:14.940 --> 01:45:15.940]   Not all caps.
[01:45:15.940 --> 01:45:18.900]   Just capitalize the first letter of every word.
[01:45:18.900 --> 01:45:23.100]   This has been the most complaining I have ever heard on any episode of back break weekly.
[01:45:23.100 --> 01:45:24.100]   Wow.
[01:45:24.100 --> 01:45:27.660]   Complaining about the headphone on the bottom really Leo even downplayed the insane screen
[01:45:27.660 --> 01:45:28.660]   quality.
[01:45:28.660 --> 01:45:30.460]   It's like I'm watching an Android central episode.
[01:45:30.460 --> 01:45:31.460]   Wow.
[01:45:31.460 --> 01:45:33.860]   Thank you very much.
[01:45:33.860 --> 01:45:35.460]   Just thought I passed that along.
[01:45:35.460 --> 01:45:39.340]   Paner the low share the panel working and vertical effect.
[01:45:39.340 --> 01:45:45.580]   I'll give you an iOS tip that is not immediately obvious, although it's a it's a it's a it's
[01:45:45.580 --> 01:45:50.580]   actually a very handy thing to know if you're in the camera app and you're in the panel
[01:45:50.580 --> 01:45:57.460]   mode so you go to options and the panel you could tap the arrow to switch the direction
[01:45:57.460 --> 01:45:58.460]   of that.
[01:45:58.460 --> 01:46:00.060]   A lot of people think I'm planning about that.
[01:46:00.060 --> 01:46:03.700]   Yes, I thought there's got to be some way to do this.
[01:46:03.700 --> 01:46:08.580]   And I and I just touched it said, Oh, yes, there is now how do you shoot up and a vertical
[01:46:08.580 --> 01:46:09.580]   panel?
[01:46:09.580 --> 01:46:10.580]   That's another question.
[01:46:10.580 --> 01:46:11.580]   I don't know.
[01:46:11.580 --> 01:46:12.580]   Oh, you turn it.
[01:46:12.580 --> 01:46:15.140]   But you just do it like that.
[01:46:15.140 --> 01:46:20.020]   And it is probably a good idea to shoot the panel for the maximum megapixels.
[01:46:20.020 --> 01:46:21.020]   Yes.
[01:46:21.020 --> 01:46:26.300]   On the side, not not horizontal, you know, horizontally not vertically not horizontal.
[01:46:26.300 --> 01:46:27.300]   But yeah, there's a tip.
[01:46:27.300 --> 01:46:28.300]   That's a good tip.
[01:46:28.300 --> 01:46:29.300]   It's a great tip.
[01:46:29.300 --> 01:46:30.300]   Tap the arrow.
[01:46:30.300 --> 01:46:31.300]   There's a lot of people talking about not being able to go through it.
[01:46:31.300 --> 01:46:32.300]   That's a great tip.
[01:46:32.300 --> 01:46:33.300]   All right.
[01:46:33.300 --> 01:46:38.900]   Mr Andy Nikon, you want to do a lion or mountain lion tip while we get Chris Greenback?
[01:46:38.900 --> 01:46:42.420]   I got I got a quick one.
[01:46:42.420 --> 01:46:47.180]   It's frustrating as heck when you try to use shuffle play and iTunes and you're listening
[01:46:47.180 --> 01:46:52.260]   for like 45 minutes and you realize, okay, look, I like that David Burns song, but you
[01:46:52.260 --> 01:46:54.700]   already played that David Berg song twice.
[01:46:54.700 --> 01:46:58.300]   Are you lying to me about randomizing this?
[01:46:58.300 --> 01:47:03.060]   And I was actually I was actually wanting to make this tip about how to truly randomize
[01:47:03.060 --> 01:47:07.420]   an iTunes shuffle play because I was hoping that Chris would say, actually, that's a good
[01:47:07.420 --> 01:47:10.340]   idea, Andy, but here's the way to really do it.
[01:47:10.340 --> 01:47:15.180]   As far as I can tell, good idea.
[01:47:15.180 --> 01:47:16.340]   I got a tip for you.
[01:47:16.340 --> 01:47:18.380]   If you're in, go ahead.
[01:47:18.380 --> 01:47:23.620]   I was going to I was going to say that there's a what the only way that I can get true random
[01:47:23.620 --> 01:47:28.580]   shuffle play is to instead of doing shuffle play on a playlist by actually clicking the
[01:47:28.580 --> 01:47:33.980]   feature, I create a smart playlist that simply says, fill this playlist with X hours worth
[01:47:33.980 --> 01:47:34.980]   of music.
[01:47:34.980 --> 01:47:39.260]   Do not include anything that has been played within the last 10 minutes or the last day
[01:47:39.260 --> 01:47:45.060]   of the and then I shuffle play on that playlist because well, that's the artist issue.
[01:47:45.060 --> 01:47:46.860]   Well, it's not an artist issue.
[01:47:46.860 --> 01:47:51.500]   It's just that it the random shuffle play when I we just simply say, here is an entire
[01:47:51.500 --> 01:47:55.340]   playlist or here's an entire musical library, just keep playing music at random.
[01:47:55.340 --> 01:47:57.500]   The same songs often keep coming up again.
[01:47:57.500 --> 01:48:03.100]   I've been told that it is because shuffle it's the shuffle tries to be a helpful shuffle
[01:48:03.100 --> 01:48:06.500]   it tries to bubble to the top songs that it thinks that you're going to want to listen
[01:48:06.500 --> 01:48:08.300]   to when actually I want completely.
[01:48:08.300 --> 01:48:09.300]   I want random.
[01:48:09.300 --> 01:48:10.300]   Yeah.
[01:48:10.300 --> 01:48:13.860]   So the only way around it that I found so far is to shuffle play from a playlist you've
[01:48:13.860 --> 01:48:18.980]   created for that purpose that is set to automatically kick out every song that you listen to in
[01:48:18.980 --> 01:48:19.980]   the past few days.
[01:48:19.980 --> 01:48:20.980]   Right.
[01:48:20.980 --> 01:48:25.420]   And as soon as it gets played, it fails to it fails to pass the test.
[01:48:25.420 --> 01:48:27.700]   It immediately gets kicked out and replaced by something new.
[01:48:27.700 --> 01:48:32.380]   And that's how you managed to get through your entire library or not not repeat the same
[01:48:32.380 --> 01:48:34.100]   two David Burns songs over and over again.
[01:48:34.100 --> 01:48:38.100]   I love David Burns, but after two or three times and a half hour, no, I don't like David
[01:48:38.100 --> 01:48:39.100]   Burns too much.
[01:48:39.100 --> 01:48:40.940]   David Burns can be bad.
[01:48:40.940 --> 01:48:41.940]   Really?
[01:48:41.940 --> 01:48:44.380]   Is that possible?
[01:48:44.380 --> 01:48:47.140]   Now Chris Breen, we've got him back.
[01:48:47.140 --> 01:48:48.140]   Hello.
[01:48:48.140 --> 01:48:49.140]   Hello.
[01:48:49.140 --> 01:48:51.620]   What's the funniest thing ever?
[01:48:51.620 --> 01:48:52.620]   Did you hear any of it?
[01:48:52.620 --> 01:48:53.740]   No, you froze, right?
[01:48:53.740 --> 01:48:57.220]   You said, I got a great lion tip.
[01:48:57.220 --> 01:49:01.820]   Oh, Chris, almost as if you were caught off guard and you needed to stall and look up something
[01:49:01.820 --> 01:49:03.300]   in one of your one books.
[01:49:03.300 --> 01:49:05.900]   So you actually basically cut the connections.
[01:49:05.900 --> 01:49:08.900]   You go, Oh, no, that's not what happened.
[01:49:08.900 --> 01:49:11.220]   No, I would never happen.
[01:49:11.220 --> 01:49:12.220]   It was awesome.
[01:49:12.220 --> 01:49:13.140]   It was totally awesome.
[01:49:13.140 --> 01:49:15.860]   So here's what the tip is.
[01:49:15.860 --> 01:49:20.660]   The tip is in Mount Lion in mail, if you'd like to go back and remember a mail message
[01:49:20.660 --> 01:49:24.580]   that you've had at one time or another, oftentimes what we'll do is we'll flag a message.
[01:49:24.580 --> 01:49:28.860]   And that's not very effective because you lose it after a couple of days.
[01:49:28.860 --> 01:49:33.900]   What you do instead is you open up the reminders application, take an email message, just grab
[01:49:33.900 --> 01:49:36.860]   the subject heading for mail and drag it into reminders.
[01:49:36.860 --> 01:49:39.860]   At which point it turns into a reminder.
[01:49:39.860 --> 01:49:41.060]   So do that.
[01:49:41.060 --> 01:49:42.460]   It shows up in your reminders.
[01:49:42.460 --> 01:49:46.120]   And then you can schedule a time for it to remind you about this email message that's
[01:49:46.120 --> 01:49:47.980]   sitting over in mail.
[01:49:47.980 --> 01:49:48.980]   Brilliant.
[01:49:48.980 --> 01:49:50.260]   Oh, that tip.
[01:49:50.260 --> 01:49:51.260]   That's great.
[01:49:51.260 --> 01:49:52.560]   Brilliant.
[01:49:52.560 --> 01:49:53.860]   I love that.
[01:49:53.860 --> 01:49:55.060]   So I'm going to have to do this.
[01:49:55.060 --> 01:49:58.540]   It's one of the nice reasons now we have reminders on our desktops.
[01:49:58.540 --> 01:49:59.540]   That's great.
[01:49:59.540 --> 01:50:00.540]   Right.
[01:50:00.540 --> 01:50:01.700]   And because it's kind of a pain to enter your own reminders.
[01:50:01.700 --> 01:50:05.020]   But if you already have a subject heading that says, let's have lunch next Thursday
[01:50:05.020 --> 01:50:08.020]   at noon, you can just drag it straight in.
[01:50:08.020 --> 01:50:09.020]   Very clever.
[01:50:09.020 --> 01:50:10.180]   All right.
[01:50:10.180 --> 01:50:13.460]   And for our picks of the week, thank you, Chris Breen.
[01:50:13.460 --> 01:50:14.460]   Let's start with you, Alex Lindsay.
[01:50:14.460 --> 01:50:15.620]   You have a pick for us today.
[01:50:15.620 --> 01:50:16.620]   Yes.
[01:50:16.620 --> 01:50:23.660]   In the-- we've been talking about the maps and how much we like the old maps better than
[01:50:23.660 --> 01:50:24.660]   it is.
[01:50:24.660 --> 01:50:27.980]   I would like to-- my pick today would be QuickTime 7.
[01:50:27.980 --> 01:50:28.980]   QuickTime.
[01:50:28.980 --> 01:50:29.980]   Pro time.
[01:50:29.980 --> 01:50:30.980]   7 Pro time at old.
[01:50:30.980 --> 01:50:31.980]   Talk about retro.
[01:50:31.980 --> 01:50:37.440]   I just want people to know out there that you bought a computer and you can't figure
[01:50:37.440 --> 01:50:40.940]   out why, you can't get it to cut and paste and you can't get some of the data and the
[01:50:40.940 --> 01:50:41.940]   tracks and everything else.
[01:50:41.940 --> 01:50:45.400]   And you don't feel like you should have to go all the way to Final Cut just to do that.
[01:50:45.400 --> 01:50:47.360]   You can-- I don't know where you download it.
[01:50:47.360 --> 01:50:51.420]   But if you have old disks, old mountain lion disks and you can get that little installer,
[01:50:51.420 --> 01:50:55.800]   even if you have an old computer, no one's really replaced it yet.
[01:50:55.800 --> 01:51:01.200]   As a-- we just brought it up because last week we used it a lot to fix a bunch of stuff.
[01:51:01.200 --> 01:51:05.120]   And we just realized-- we were surprised that it still worked on Mountain Lion.
[01:51:05.120 --> 01:51:06.840]   It does.
[01:51:06.840 --> 01:51:10.920]   And Apple has still never really fixed QuickTime 10.
[01:51:10.920 --> 01:51:14.120]   So they still offer for download version 7.6.6.
[01:51:14.120 --> 01:51:15.120]   Here it is.
[01:51:15.120 --> 01:51:16.120]   Is it available?
[01:51:16.120 --> 01:51:17.120]   Yeah.
[01:51:17.120 --> 01:51:19.880]   And then you can-- you can still-- for a long time you had to have like the disk to download
[01:51:19.880 --> 01:51:20.880]   it.
[01:51:20.880 --> 01:51:23.280]   And when you try to run the installer, sometimes it says there's a newer one.
[01:51:23.280 --> 01:51:26.120]   So a lot of times we just copy the QuickTime folder over and then put our still and we're
[01:51:26.120 --> 01:51:27.440]   back in.
[01:51:27.440 --> 01:51:36.120]   But it is-- you know, it is still a-- I wouldn't say that you should get it for viewing video.
[01:51:36.120 --> 01:51:37.480]   So all you want to do is view videos.
[01:51:37.480 --> 01:51:39.520]   QuickTime 10 is just fine.
[01:51:39.520 --> 01:51:43.440]   But if you want-- there is so many-- there are so many tools hidden inside of QuickTime
[01:51:43.440 --> 01:51:48.440]   7 to extract tracks out of your QuickTime to-- to recut your QuickTime.
[01:51:48.440 --> 01:51:51.760]   Like if you have the H.264 and you just want to cut it up into a whole bunch of little
[01:51:51.760 --> 01:51:54.200]   pieces, you can do that in QuickTime 7.
[01:51:54.200 --> 01:51:58.280]   Now what I would suggest is someone listening.
[01:51:58.280 --> 01:52:02.200]   There's a huge opportunity for someone just to build an app that just replicates what
[01:52:02.200 --> 01:52:05.960]   QuickTime 7 did because there are-- because for instance if you're doing a-- I have an
[01:52:05.960 --> 01:52:10.720]   H.264 and I want to put them all up on YouTube but I want to cut a two-hour thing into 10,
[01:52:10.720 --> 01:52:14.600]   20-minute thing-- you know, whatever, 10 little 10-minute things or whatever.
[01:52:14.600 --> 01:52:16.400]   And I don't want to recompress it.
[01:52:16.400 --> 01:52:18.160]   I just want to cut it up and put it out there.
[01:52:18.160 --> 01:52:20.440]   There's not a lot of good tools to do that that I know of.
[01:52:20.440 --> 01:52:24.080]   And if there is, then someone should tell me because we still use QuickTime 7.
[01:52:24.080 --> 01:52:27.280]   Well, there's a reason I suspect that Apple continues to offer it.
[01:52:27.280 --> 01:52:31.160]   Yeah, because it's really, really useful and they've never put that functionality back
[01:52:31.160 --> 01:52:34.080]   in the QuickTime 10, not that I'm bitter.
[01:52:34.080 --> 01:52:35.720]   Isn't that interesting?
[01:52:35.720 --> 01:52:38.080]   Anyway, but I just thought I'd remind people that it still works.
[01:52:38.080 --> 01:52:40.320]   I'm not in line because it's great.
[01:52:40.320 --> 01:52:44.440]   And I wish someone would just draw-- just build an app that did that too.
[01:52:44.440 --> 01:52:45.440]   And I just downloaded it.
[01:52:45.440 --> 01:52:46.880]   There you go.
[01:52:46.880 --> 01:52:47.880]   Because you can.
[01:52:47.880 --> 01:52:48.880]   Just because you can.
[01:52:48.880 --> 01:52:49.880]   Yeah.
[01:52:49.880 --> 01:52:52.120]   Chris Brain, you got to pick for us something you like?
[01:52:52.120 --> 01:52:53.280]   I do.
[01:52:53.280 --> 01:52:55.120]   It's an Mac application.
[01:52:55.120 --> 01:52:57.440]   It's called AirServer.
[01:52:57.440 --> 01:53:04.160]   And the idea behind AirServer is it allows you to use your Macintosh as a destination
[01:53:04.160 --> 01:53:05.520]   for AirPlay.
[01:53:05.520 --> 01:53:07.800]   So in this case, I've got my tablet here.
[01:53:07.800 --> 01:53:12.560]   You probably can't see it, but my Mac Pro is offered as an AirPlay destination.
[01:53:12.560 --> 01:53:13.560]   Ooh, neat.
[01:53:13.560 --> 01:53:18.320]   So what I can do is mirror the video from here onto my Mac.
[01:53:18.320 --> 01:53:19.320]   That's great.
[01:53:19.320 --> 01:53:24.280]   This is one way-- if you don't want an Apple TV and you want to mirror stuff to a computer
[01:53:24.280 --> 01:53:29.320]   that way, that happens to be connected to a television set, which is kind of a problem,
[01:53:29.320 --> 01:53:30.480]   that's one way to do it.
[01:53:30.480 --> 01:53:35.600]   For my particular purposes, I've been doing a lot of video lately capturing iPhones and
[01:53:35.600 --> 01:53:38.960]   iPads for Linda.com as well as for Macworld.
[01:53:38.960 --> 01:53:40.200]   This is how I do it.
[01:53:40.200 --> 01:53:42.800]   I mirror the display, which is looks really good.
[01:53:42.800 --> 01:53:47.880]   It goes up to 1080p, mirror it to my Mac, and then I capture my Mac screen of what I'm
[01:53:47.880 --> 01:53:49.480]   doing on the iPad.
[01:53:49.480 --> 01:53:53.400]   The one thing that it can't do is show you your taps so you don't get any kind of highlight
[01:53:53.400 --> 01:53:54.560]   that comes up.
[01:53:54.560 --> 01:53:59.320]   But otherwise, it shows you exactly what's coming up on your iPad and it captures it beautifully.
[01:53:59.320 --> 01:54:06.040]   So if you need to do a screen capture of the video on your iPad or iOS device, that's
[01:54:06.040 --> 01:54:07.040]   the way to do it.
[01:54:07.040 --> 01:54:09.440]   It's $15, works really well.
[01:54:09.440 --> 01:54:10.440]   You don't have to configure it.
[01:54:10.440 --> 01:54:13.960]   You just launch the thing after you paid for it and it's just up and running.
[01:54:13.960 --> 01:54:14.960]   Who's it from?
[01:54:14.960 --> 01:54:18.240]   Who are these people that make this thing?
[01:54:18.240 --> 01:54:19.720]   It's from the App Store.
[01:54:19.720 --> 01:54:20.720]   It's no, it's not.
[01:54:20.720 --> 01:54:21.720]   It's actually a Mac App.
[01:54:21.720 --> 01:54:23.880]   Is it on the Mac App Store?
[01:54:23.880 --> 01:54:24.880]   I think there's server.
[01:54:24.880 --> 01:54:25.880]   Look at it.
[01:54:25.880 --> 01:54:26.880]   There's server.
[01:54:26.880 --> 01:54:30.320]   The Apple would not put on the App Store, but...
[01:54:30.320 --> 01:54:32.880]   Yeah, there's the page.
[01:54:32.880 --> 01:54:34.080]   Air Server.
[01:54:34.080 --> 01:54:35.920]   And it's from...
[01:54:35.920 --> 01:54:38.720]   I can't quite re-alien...
[01:54:38.720 --> 01:54:39.720]   What is it?
[01:54:39.720 --> 01:54:40.720]   Asian...
[01:54:40.720 --> 01:54:41.720]   What does it say?
[01:54:41.720 --> 01:54:44.480]   I'm sorry.
[01:54:44.480 --> 01:54:45.480]   Could you tell me what the name of that...
[01:54:45.480 --> 01:54:47.480]   If you go to Air Server, where are you looking?
[01:54:47.480 --> 01:54:48.480]   I don't even...
[01:54:48.480 --> 01:54:50.480]   It's the top of the page.
[01:54:50.480 --> 01:54:51.480]   Air Server app.com.
[01:54:51.480 --> 01:54:52.480]   Thank you.
[01:54:52.480 --> 01:54:53.480]   Air Server app.com.
[01:54:53.480 --> 01:54:54.480]   Thank you.
[01:54:54.480 --> 01:54:56.280]   Thank you, sir.
[01:54:56.280 --> 01:55:04.320]   And then, Mr. Andy Naco, your pick of the week.
[01:55:04.320 --> 01:55:09.560]   This is a really good resource for people like me who are not very good guitar players,
[01:55:09.560 --> 01:55:11.160]   but would like to be better guitar players.
[01:55:11.160 --> 01:55:13.400]   It's called Guitar Toolkit.
[01:55:13.400 --> 01:55:19.600]   It's an app for the iPhone and for the iPad that is just a nice collection of very, very
[01:55:19.600 --> 01:55:22.840]   polished and well-designed utilities.
[01:55:22.840 --> 01:55:26.200]   What I really use it for are chord lookups.
[01:55:26.200 --> 01:55:30.920]   I've downloaded some sheet music or I've downloaded, like I said, the chorus for this
[01:55:30.920 --> 01:55:33.920]   song goes CD minor, E flat, E flat, E flat.
[01:55:33.920 --> 01:55:37.400]   Of course, I don't know what they're talking about, but this app will let me look it up
[01:55:37.400 --> 01:55:40.360]   and I can see, okay, there's a C diminished.
[01:55:40.360 --> 01:55:42.760]   Oh my God, look where my fingers are supposed to go.
[01:55:42.760 --> 01:55:44.320]   I don't think I could play that.
[01:55:44.320 --> 01:55:48.120]   Something else that I'm actually capable of playing.
[01:55:48.120 --> 01:55:55.080]   It also has a built-in tuner, it has scales, it has a built-in metronome.
[01:55:55.080 --> 01:55:59.760]   I like it a lot because it has a bunch of different instruments built into it.
[01:55:59.760 --> 01:56:04.240]   So if you're playing bass, if you're playing ukulele, if you're playing guitar, you can
[01:56:04.240 --> 01:56:08.520]   set it up so that it will give you the right chords for what you're doing.
[01:56:08.520 --> 01:56:10.160]   And so it makes things a lot easier.
[01:56:10.160 --> 01:56:13.240]   I'm not, I don't play it by ear, unfortunately.
[01:56:13.240 --> 01:56:17.320]   I do have to see this chart in front of me and figure out, okay, so I've got to put my
[01:56:17.320 --> 01:56:20.800]   ears, it makes it as dumb as I'm going to zoom in a little bit here.
[01:56:20.800 --> 01:56:23.880]   It makes it as dumb as here is the fretboard.
[01:56:23.880 --> 01:56:26.400]   Here is where your fingers have to go on the strings.
[01:56:26.400 --> 01:56:29.120]   Do you think you can make your fingers make do that?
[01:56:29.120 --> 01:56:31.840]   And so that's where the actual chords go.
[01:56:31.840 --> 01:56:40.500]   It's not cheap, it's 10 bucks, but guitar tools are a lot like clock apps in that there
[01:56:40.500 --> 01:56:44.320]   are a million of them of which maybe three are any good.
[01:56:44.320 --> 01:56:47.240]   So there are a lot of tuner apps or a lot of chord apps, but this is the one that I've
[01:56:47.240 --> 01:56:51.120]   seen where everything is all in one and each one of these tools is built really, really
[01:56:51.120 --> 01:56:52.120]   well.
[01:56:52.120 --> 01:56:53.960]   10 bucks, not cheap, but worth it.
[01:56:53.960 --> 01:56:57.760]   If you go straight to this one and spend, instead of spending a buck down and I for this
[01:56:57.760 --> 01:57:03.240]   bad one, two nine nine for this bad one, it actually I think balances out.
[01:57:03.240 --> 01:57:06.760]   I will not do a pick, but I will mention because people were asking, yes, there is a new Apple
[01:57:06.760 --> 01:57:07.760]   TV update.
[01:57:07.760 --> 01:57:11.720]   And as far as I can tell, and make, correct me if I'm wrong, guys, it's the shared photo
[01:57:11.720 --> 01:57:12.880]   streams update.
[01:57:12.880 --> 01:57:19.320]   So you can now share photo streams using iPhoto and those shared photo streams will show up
[01:57:19.320 --> 01:57:20.640]   on your Apple TV.
[01:57:20.640 --> 01:57:25.640]   Great way to share pictures of the kids with the grandma, things like that if she's got
[01:57:25.640 --> 01:57:26.640]   an Apple TV.
[01:57:26.640 --> 01:57:27.640]   Yes.
[01:57:27.640 --> 01:57:31.720]   Any, does anybody else know of other changes in the new Apple TV?
[01:57:31.720 --> 01:57:32.720]   That's the only other thing.
[01:57:32.720 --> 01:57:37.280]   Yeah, they have, you can choose now AirPlay Speaker destinations from within your Apple
[01:57:37.280 --> 01:57:38.280]   TV.
[01:57:38.280 --> 01:57:42.360]   You can rearrange third party applications on the home screen, not Apple's apps, but that
[01:57:42.360 --> 01:57:44.960]   next row, next series of rows down.
[01:57:44.960 --> 01:57:49.400]   So you just pointed your Apple TV, click and hold on the select button, then the little
[01:57:49.400 --> 01:57:53.800]   app starts wiggling just like on an iOS device, then you move your remote to the right or
[01:57:53.800 --> 01:57:57.920]   left or down, you can change the icon order there.
[01:57:57.920 --> 01:58:02.240]   It will also allow you to change iTunes accounts.
[01:58:02.240 --> 01:58:06.680]   So if your brother-in-law comes in and has a bunch of material on iTunes match or some
[01:58:06.680 --> 01:58:11.920]   purchased items, you can enter that person's ID and then have access to their content on
[01:58:11.920 --> 01:58:15.120]   your Apple ID until you switch back to a different Apple ID.
[01:58:15.120 --> 01:58:19.080]   So if you have a second or third generation Apple TV, you know, with a little hockey puck
[01:58:19.080 --> 01:58:23.720]   Apple TVs, download software update 5.1.
[01:58:23.720 --> 01:58:26.400]   You get a lot of new things, it sounds like, I didn't realize.
[01:58:26.400 --> 01:58:28.200]   Yeah, it's a cool update.
[01:58:28.200 --> 01:58:29.680]   Yeah, well worth it.
[01:58:29.680 --> 01:58:34.040]   I tend to take a long time to do the updates on the Apple TV because it makes me do all
[01:58:34.040 --> 01:58:36.840]   my registration numbers again, like all the passwords.
[01:58:36.840 --> 01:58:37.840]   Oh, I hope it doesn't do that.
[01:58:37.840 --> 01:58:40.840]   And so I always like, oh, I don't remember what my, I don't want to do that.
[01:58:40.840 --> 01:58:42.720]   So then, so I like it to really want it.
[01:58:42.720 --> 01:58:45.400]   But listen, this one looks like it's worth going to the trouble.
[01:58:45.400 --> 01:58:47.280]   I don't want to do that.
[01:58:47.280 --> 01:58:48.280]   I know.
[01:58:48.280 --> 01:58:52.480]   Alex Lindsay is a occasional visitor from the West.
[01:58:52.480 --> 01:58:54.080]   I might even be here next week too.
[01:58:54.080 --> 01:58:55.080]   Wow.
[01:58:55.080 --> 01:58:56.680]   Where have you been and where are you going?
[01:58:56.680 --> 01:58:58.080]   Oh, I love this.
[01:58:58.080 --> 01:58:59.080]   So many places.
[01:58:59.080 --> 01:59:00.080]   You travel travel travel.
[01:59:00.080 --> 01:59:01.080]   Yes, I know.
[01:59:01.080 --> 01:59:02.840]   I was actually in San Francisco last week.
[01:59:02.840 --> 01:59:04.400]   I was, I was at Dreamforce.
[01:59:04.400 --> 01:59:05.400]   We were working at Dreamforce.
[01:59:05.400 --> 01:59:06.400]   Dreamforce.
[01:59:06.400 --> 01:59:08.400]   And where are you going next?
[01:59:08.400 --> 01:59:13.760]   Next, I am, I think I'm going to LA and Denver next week, I think.
[01:59:13.760 --> 01:59:14.760]   And then, that's right.
[01:59:14.760 --> 01:59:17.520]   We talked about that because I'm going there for the Madonna concert.
[01:59:17.520 --> 01:59:19.440]   I'm not going to Madonna concert.
[01:59:19.440 --> 01:59:22.000]   So it is musical, but it's not Madonna.
[01:59:22.000 --> 01:59:24.840]   And then I'm bouncing around every week.
[01:59:24.840 --> 01:59:27.200]   I'm going to be in a different city to do some stuff.
[01:59:27.200 --> 01:59:29.120]   But we will have you back next week.
[01:59:29.120 --> 01:59:32.080]   I'm going to Rwanda later in the month, later in October.
[01:59:32.080 --> 01:59:34.160]   So I'm going to try to log in.
[01:59:34.160 --> 01:59:35.160]   Always welcome.
[01:59:35.160 --> 01:59:36.160]   Yeah, to have you here.
[01:59:36.160 --> 01:59:37.160]   Thank you.
[01:59:37.160 --> 01:59:38.160]   Appreciate it.
[01:59:38.160 --> 01:59:39.160]   Thank you.
[01:59:39.160 --> 01:59:40.160]   Thank you.
[01:59:40.160 --> 01:59:41.160]   Thank you.
[01:59:41.160 --> 01:59:42.160]   Thank you.
[01:59:42.160 --> 01:59:43.160]   Thank you.
[01:59:43.160 --> 01:59:44.160]   Thank you.
[01:59:44.160 --> 01:59:45.160]   Thank you.
[01:59:45.160 --> 01:59:46.160]   Thank you.
[01:59:46.160 --> 01:59:47.160]   Thank you.
[01:59:47.160 --> 01:59:48.160]   I appreciate it.
[01:59:48.160 --> 01:59:49.160]   Well, thank you very much.
[01:59:49.160 --> 01:59:51.160]   I'm going to actually see you, I think a little over a week from now at, there's the North Coast,
[01:59:51.160 --> 01:59:52.160]   McIntosh, you're just group gathering.
[01:59:52.160 --> 01:59:53.660]   Ah, yes, Reverend, a little dinner.
[01:59:53.660 --> 01:59:54.660]   Tell us about that.
[01:59:54.660 --> 01:59:58.760]   That's only for people who are in Northern California probably.
[01:59:58.760 --> 02:00:02.840]   But really kind of, I think there are a lot of these little Mac Expo.
[02:00:02.840 --> 02:00:04.560]   This one is an awesome one.
[02:00:04.560 --> 02:00:05.560]   Yeah.
[02:00:05.560 --> 02:00:06.560]   It really is.
[02:00:06.560 --> 02:00:07.720]   It's a nice little Expo.
[02:00:07.720 --> 02:00:11.440]   It's so like Mac world Expo smaller.
[02:00:11.440 --> 02:00:14.840]   So they have speakers, I'll be speaking there with a lot of other people.
[02:00:14.840 --> 02:00:17.680]   They have exhibitors there as well.
[02:00:17.680 --> 02:00:20.400]   One of the things I'm excited about is the night before we're going to have a little
[02:00:20.400 --> 02:00:27.000]   dinner and I believe we get to come over to Twit Studios and hope under the furniture.
[02:00:27.000 --> 02:00:28.000]   We'll have fun.
[02:00:28.000 --> 02:00:29.000]   Good.
[02:00:29.000 --> 02:00:30.000]   Well, I'll see you.
[02:00:30.000 --> 02:00:31.000]   I think we will.
[02:00:31.000 --> 02:00:33.480]   If people want to know more about the event, is there a website?
[02:00:33.480 --> 02:00:34.480]   I'm just looking.
[02:00:34.480 --> 02:00:39.800]   I think if you Google NC mug Mac Expo, you'll find it.
[02:00:39.800 --> 02:00:40.800]   Yeah.
[02:00:40.800 --> 02:00:41.800]   Yeah.
[02:00:41.800 --> 02:00:42.800]   And it's coming up October 6th.
[02:00:42.800 --> 02:00:49.200]   And that's just right over here on the Mac mind.
[02:00:49.200 --> 02:00:52.240]   Yeah, the Petaluma community center.
[02:00:52.240 --> 02:00:53.240]   Yeah.
[02:00:53.240 --> 02:00:54.240]   Where they play the movie solo.
[02:00:54.240 --> 02:00:58.120]   Celebrating the 19th year of, wow, they've been doing this a long time.
[02:00:58.120 --> 02:01:00.920]   I think MaccomputerExpo.com, is that right?
[02:01:00.920 --> 02:01:04.280]   And it's a great collection of vendors and great speakers.
[02:01:04.280 --> 02:01:07.520]   And it's just, if you're in Northern California or somewhere in California, it's definitely
[02:01:07.520 --> 02:01:08.520]   worth coming out.
[02:01:08.520 --> 02:01:13.480]   MaccomputerExpo.com at the Petaluma community center.
[02:01:13.480 --> 02:01:16.360]   And if you go to that, just come over to the Twitbrick house while you're there.
[02:01:16.360 --> 02:01:17.360]   Say hi.
[02:01:17.360 --> 02:01:18.360]   Famous last words.
[02:01:18.360 --> 02:01:23.080]   We'll have our own little expo here.
[02:01:23.080 --> 02:01:24.080]   Thank you, Andy and Ico.
[02:01:24.080 --> 02:01:26.840]   Andy's a two part review of the iPhone 5, three part review.
[02:01:26.840 --> 02:01:30.760]   The iPhone 5 begins tomorrow, three parts.
[02:01:30.760 --> 02:01:34.160]   And the Chicago Sun Times, starting with a photography.
[02:01:34.160 --> 02:01:36.640]   And people should go and look at your Flickr stream.
[02:01:36.640 --> 02:01:43.960]   Andy I is his username, A-N-D-Y-I on Flickr, to see the photos that you took with all
[02:01:43.960 --> 02:01:48.240]   of the real, not point and shoot, but actually a real high end.
[02:01:48.240 --> 02:01:53.920]   Micro four thirds camera and iPhone 5, 4S and some other cameras, Galaxy S3, to see
[02:01:53.920 --> 02:01:55.960]   which is the best.
[02:01:55.960 --> 02:01:59.600]   You make your judgments before you read the article, before the show we were looking
[02:01:59.600 --> 02:02:00.600]   at it.
[02:02:00.600 --> 02:02:01.600]   It's not obvious.
[02:02:01.600 --> 02:02:03.280]   I can tell which one.
[02:02:03.280 --> 02:02:06.400]   I'll be posting one more photo set in a few hours.
[02:02:06.400 --> 02:02:10.680]   I'm a portrait of self-portraits of myself to get skin 12.
[02:02:10.680 --> 02:02:13.560]   Not normal skin tones, but at least geek skin tones.
[02:02:13.560 --> 02:02:15.360]   Pale geek skin tones.
[02:02:15.360 --> 02:02:16.880]   It's very, very surprising.
[02:02:16.880 --> 02:02:19.120]   I posted these a few days ago.
[02:02:19.120 --> 02:02:25.000]   Now I myself do not necessarily remember what order I put these things in.
[02:02:25.000 --> 02:02:29.040]   So I myself am planning interesting to look at these and saying, gee, I don't know.
[02:02:29.040 --> 02:02:31.840]   I think these three are very, very close to each other.
[02:02:31.840 --> 02:02:33.760]   I think these two are almost identical.
[02:02:33.760 --> 02:02:36.800]   I know that that means that it's the iPhone 5 and something else.
[02:02:36.800 --> 02:02:37.800]   I don't know what that good thing is.
[02:02:37.800 --> 02:02:40.920]   Yeah, I mean, if there's anything I learned from this is that how close these, all of
[02:02:40.920 --> 02:02:44.880]   these top of the line, including the iPhone 4S, phones are, I mean, they all have pretty
[02:02:44.880 --> 02:02:47.480]   credible cameras.
[02:02:47.480 --> 02:02:49.320]   I will post the answer keys tomorrow.
[02:02:49.320 --> 02:02:50.720]   I did write them down.
[02:02:50.720 --> 02:02:52.720]   So I myself know.
[02:02:52.720 --> 02:02:55.840]   It's not as though it's been a complete waste of time for everybody.
[02:02:55.840 --> 02:03:04.200]   Chicago Sun Times, which one of these is an iPhone 5 picture?
[02:03:04.200 --> 02:03:07.880]   Spot three differences and win.
[02:03:07.880 --> 02:03:08.880]   Thank you, Andy.
[02:03:08.880 --> 02:03:10.240]   CWOB.com is his blog.
[02:03:10.240 --> 02:03:13.640]   We do this show 11 a.m. Pacific 2 p.m. Eastern Time on Tuesdays.
[02:03:13.640 --> 02:03:15.840]   That's 1800 UTC.
[02:03:15.840 --> 02:03:18.720]   You can watch live on Twit.tv, participate in the chatroom.
[02:03:18.720 --> 02:03:20.200]   We appreciate it if you do that.

[02:03:23.480 --> 02:03:26.320]   Just email tickets at twit.tv tickets.
[02:03:26.320 --> 02:03:27.960]   No, there's no tickets.
[02:03:27.960 --> 02:03:29.120]   Could you guys get tickets?
[02:03:29.120 --> 02:03:31.320]   No, it's just imaginary tickets.
[02:03:31.320 --> 02:03:36.400]   A gold, special gold plated tickets, tickets at twit.tv, mostly to let us know when you're
[02:03:36.400 --> 02:03:40.400]   coming so we can put out chairs for you, but also so we can send you directions and all
[02:03:40.400 --> 02:03:41.960]   of that because we do love having a live studio.
[02:03:41.960 --> 02:03:42.960]   It's a great studio.
[02:03:42.960 --> 02:03:44.400]   It's always good to have you.
[02:03:44.400 --> 02:03:46.000]   I think we should make tickets.
[02:03:46.000 --> 02:03:47.000]   We can make tickets.
[02:03:47.000 --> 02:03:48.000]   Let's ask Lisa.
[02:03:48.000 --> 02:03:50.280]   We have to give you a little special ticket.
[02:03:50.280 --> 02:03:51.280]   Would you guys like tickets?
[02:03:51.280 --> 02:03:52.280]   Yeah.
[02:03:52.280 --> 02:03:55.520]   Special little tickets.
[02:03:55.520 --> 02:03:56.600]   So do come and visit.
[02:03:56.600 --> 02:04:00.360]   We love it if you can't watch live.
[02:04:00.360 --> 02:04:05.320]   You can always get on-demand versions, audio and video available after the fact.
[02:04:05.320 --> 02:04:08.320]   Twit.tv/mbw.
[02:04:08.320 --> 02:04:12.920]   Thanks to our producer Chad Johnson for putting together a great panel and a lot of great
[02:04:12.920 --> 02:04:14.360]   stories for us to talk about.
[02:04:14.360 --> 02:04:16.240]   We appreciate it and we'll see you next time.
[02:04:16.240 --> 02:04:19.640]   Now get back to work as break time is over.
[02:04:19.640 --> 02:04:20.640]   [music]
[02:04:20.640 --> 02:04:21.640]   [music]
[02:04:21.640 --> 02:04:22.640]   [music]
[02:04:23.640 --> 02:04:23.640]   [music]
[02:04:24.640 --> 02:04:24.640]   [music]
[02:04:25.640 --> 02:04:25.640]   [music]
[02:04:26.640 --> 02:04:26.640]   [music]
[02:04:27.640 --> 02:04:27.640]   [music]
[02:04:28.640 --> 02:04:28.640]   [music]
[02:04:29.640 --> 02:04:29.640]   [music]
[02:04:29.640 --> 02:04:32.220]   (upbeat music)
[02:04:32.220 --> 02:04:35.020]   (intense music)
