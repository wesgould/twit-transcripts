[00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:33.080]   Renee Richie is here from iMore.com and his new studio.
[00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:35.080]   Finally! I see it.
[00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:36.280]   Finally.
[00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:39.080]   Is that a stone wall behind you? That's pretty.
[00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:40.280]   Yeah, it's like slate, I think.
[00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:41.480]   I like that.
[00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:43.280]   And there's a river out there, but you can't tell.
[00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:48.080]   I would just a little tip. I'd get a little closer to the wall, get everything else out of the shot.
[00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:50.480]   Have that wall be your backdrop. That looks good.
[00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:54.680]   I'm going to try to set that up for next time. I'm on like a little jury-reg kitchen table.
[00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:55.680]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.680]   Everything is cardboard, mirrors and gum tape.
[00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:04.680]   It's like the original Don and Drew podcast they did in their kitchen on TV trays with
[00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.880]   microphones supported by wire hangers twisted into.
[00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:09.880]   Back in my day, Lepork.
[00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:12.880]   That's how we did it. And then we liked it.
[00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:17.880]   And Andy and that goes here. The Chicago Suntimes CWOB.com.
[00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:27.480]   Andy, yeah, this is this is this is the will be populating the background a little bit more as we as we as we as we as we finish.
[00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.880]   I love it. Both of you getting new studios at the same time.
[00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:31.080]   We should coordinate next time.
[00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:32.280]   Yeah.
[00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:38.080]   Yeah, we should we should do a we should do a podcast on like rebooting your entire network.
[00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:44.080]   Rebooting your entire audio set up when you you don't have 10 years worth of you have accumulated.
[00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:45.680]   Well, you've got this kind of speaker here.
[00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:51.880]   This kind of projector there. Now you have to decide what if you really have to go A or B.
[00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:57.480]   Your review are you call it an un review of the HomePod emerged today as long with
[00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:07.280]   Neelite Patel and Joanna Stern, Joanna, likened it to the bottom half of a sesame bagel compared to a everything bagel.
[00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:09.080]   She only knows New York bagels.
[00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:10.880]   So that can be that can be for good.
[00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:12.280]   Not much real bagels.
[00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:13.480]   Not the same.
[00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:15.880]   I have my little friend here. I think yeah.
[00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:18.680]   Oh, you got it. You've had it for a week when you wrote the reviews.
[00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:19.280]   Almost a week.
[00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:19.680]   Yeah.
[00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:25.880]   So one thing I learned from Neelite Patel, a Neelite Patel's article is that Apple has a materials department,
[00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:29.280]   a soft materials department that made the wrapper.
[00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:30.280]   Yes.
[00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:31.280]   For the HomePod.
[00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:34.480]   The acoustically transparent cloth mesh.
[00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:37.280]   And there's a cloth cord even.
[00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:39.080]   Yeah, I can hold that.
[00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:43.080]   You know, I hope this is more resilient than the lightning cords and the magsafe cords.
[00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:45.080]   Because they don't want it everywhere.
[00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:47.080]   I know it's really beautiful.
[00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:50.680]   It's hardwired though into the back of the HomePod.
[00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:51.480]   Oh, that's too bad.
[00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:51.680]   Yeah.
[00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:54.880]   So you can't just buy it here and slip it to South African power.
[00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:57.080]   I have no idea what you're talking about, Renee.
[00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:59.480]   I think that's the rubber cord.
[00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:01.080]   The standards for cords are wonderful.
[00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:03.480]   Did your hamster get to that? What the heck?
[00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:04.880]   No, just just life.
[00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:09.680]   Just just just just you know, atmosphere air got to it.
[00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:13.680]   Hard winter in in Boston land, Leo and we had to and yet to survive.
[00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:21.680]   So my, you know, summary of the reviews I've read so far, including yours, Renee is it sounds really good.
[00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:23.080]   Sounds really good.
[00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:23.480]   Yeah.
[00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:24.580]   Yeah, no, it really does.
[00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:25.880]   There's a lot of technology here.
[00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:33.080]   And you think that you know, Apple is not a speaker company, but they've been slowly and quietly accumulating a ton of speaker talent over the last few years.
[00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:35.080]   And they've added all their computational talent.
[00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:39.880]   And then they've added all their own tools and all their own tools.
[00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:43.080]   And then they've added all their own tools and all their own tools.
[00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:46.480]   And then they've added all their own tools and all their own tools.
[00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:50.080]   And then they've added all their own tools and all their own tools.
[00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:54.280]   And then they've added all their own tools and all their own tools.
[00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:57.480]   And then they've added all their own tools and all their own tools.
[00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:01.880]   And then they've added all their own tools and all their own tools.
[00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:06.680]   And then they've added all their own tools and all their own tools and all their own tools.
[00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:12.480]   And then they've added all their own tools and all their own tools and all their own tools.
[00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:17.880]   And then they've added all their own tools and all their own tools and all their own tools.
[00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:22.880]   And then they've added all their own tools and all their own tools and all their own tools.
[00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:28.080]   And then they've added all their own tools and all their own tools and all their own tools.
[00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:33.280]   And then they've added all their own tools and all their own tools and all their own tools.
[00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:38.480]   And then they've added all their own tools and all their own tools and all their own tools.
[00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:43.680]   And then they've added all their own tools and all their own tools and all their own tools.
[00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:49.680]   And then they've added all their own tools and all their own tools and all their own tools.
[00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:55.080]   And then they've added all their own tools and all their own tools and all their own tools.
[00:05:55.280 --> 00:06:00.480]   And sometimes there was foam acoustic tiling and they had these huge loop arrays of speakers
[00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:04.280]   and microphones so they could beam stuff at the home pod, pull stuff out of the home pod
[00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:07.280]   and just little home pods in the middle of this whole room.
[00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:11.280]   And what's really cool is they had the iPhone team and they have a whole iPhone vibration team
[00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:15.680]   whose only job it is to make sure the iPhone doesn't buzz or make low frequency sounds
[00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:20.080]   or do other things to disturb you and to make sure that no matter where you put the headset on your ear
[00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:24.480]   it sort of tries to beam form the sound from the speaker into the position that you're holding it.
[00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:28.880]   And they brought it in so that if you were sleeping there was no sound
[00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:32.080]   you wouldn't hear any buzzes or vibrations or anything from home pod
[00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:34.080]   or you wouldn't hear any sort of noise distortions.
[00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:35.680]   And they went from room to room.
[00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:39.680]   They had a bunch of Apple employees who were testing it and they got acoustic models back from them.
[00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:43.880]   And they built a room that was the average of all the different environments that it was in
[00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:47.080]   and they could tweak that to sort of figure out what it was like with ambient noise.
[00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:52.280]   And they had a room that was made out of concrete and steel feet and feet of concrete and steel
[00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:55.280]   and then isolated all noise down to minus two decibels.
[00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:59.880]   And when they closed that door it was just the most unnatural sort of feeling in the world
[00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:02.680]   and they're using that to test sort of like noise coming out of the device.
[00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:03.880]   It was all super interesting.
[00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:08.480]   After seeing all that you'd be hard pressed to not think this thing sounded better than anything else.
[00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:09.880]   But does it really?
[00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:14.080]   I mean, seriously, can you put that out of your mind that they did all that and listen to it?
[00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:17.680]   One of my concerns, it's very easy and everybody does this.
[00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:23.480]   What we haven't seen yet is the graph of frequency response, which we used to see,
[00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:28.880]   stereo review every time there's a new system they would have from 20 hertz to 20K.
[00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:34.280]   You know, the frequency response and you want a flat frequency response if you want an accurate speaker.
[00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:40.280]   But as JBL learned early on and many others, Bose, nobody wants a flat speaker.
[00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:47.680]   You want a speaker that's tweaked to sound better, which often means little bumps in the equalizer at certain places.
[00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:52.280]   So that problem with doing that is that it sounds better on some kinds of music
[00:07:52.280 --> 00:07:54.480]   and not on other kinds of music.
[00:07:54.480 --> 00:08:01.680]   And that's one problem with a lot of modern day speakers is that they sound great with modern pop music.
[00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:05.480]   But Andy put them on your, you know, Donna Demerro.
[00:08:05.480 --> 00:08:06.280]   They go on opera.
[00:08:06.280 --> 00:08:08.080]   And it's not going to sound as good.
[00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:09.680]   And that's tricky.
[00:08:09.680 --> 00:08:10.680]   Now I'd be interested.
[00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:12.280]   Apple might be smart enough.
[00:08:12.280 --> 00:08:13.480]   They're putting enough power in this thing.
[00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:21.880]   It's got the brains of an iPhone 6 to sense to know what kind of music is playing and to change even the frequency curve.
[00:08:21.880 --> 00:08:24.200]   So does it sound fine across the board?
[00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:26.000]   What is it? Have you did you do a curve?
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:27.280]   Do you know what its curve is?
[00:08:27.280 --> 00:08:27.880]   Yeah.
[00:08:27.880 --> 00:08:35.280]   So I'm the opposite of an audio file and I was approaching this like wouldn't idiot like me actually even notice a difference compared to different speakers.
[00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:37.480]   But they did explain as part of the tour that they did.
[00:08:37.480 --> 00:08:41.680]   They made sure they did everything in those rooms to make it absolutely scientifically perfect.
[00:08:41.680 --> 00:08:43.480]   So it'd be that sort of that neutral speaker.
[00:08:43.480 --> 00:08:45.280]   But you don't really want that I think.
[00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:45.680]   No.
[00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:53.080]   So then they handed it off to the team of the audio files at Apple and the people who are artistic about sound and they tuned it for human being.
[00:08:53.080 --> 00:09:01.080]   Is there a way in the settings to say what the frequency responses not that I've seen and it does it is continuously modeling.
[00:09:01.080 --> 00:09:02.480]   So it senses for any change in the room.
[00:09:02.480 --> 00:09:10.280]   Any it will sense changes in volume and re-modulate everything so that the bass doesn't get deformed if it's too low or the volume is too high.
[00:09:10.480 --> 00:09:15.480]   So it's continuously analyzing everything about itself and all the reverberation and echoes and everything to make sure it sounds good.
[00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:21.680]   So I don't know specifically that is adjusting for kind of music but it is always adjusting for whatever metrics it can pull out of the environment.
[00:09:21.680 --> 00:09:24.080]   Here's just for eye candy while we talk about it.
[00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:34.880]   I just seen unboxing her home pod and probably she's not conscious of this but I noted she's not only wearing a series 3 Apple watch but also a slave shackle bracelet.
[00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:38.680]   So she's got kind of the both worlds in there somehow.
[00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:41.680]   It's bigger than I thought or maybe she's smaller than I thought.
[00:09:41.680 --> 00:09:47.080]   I don't know. It could be could be either one nicely boxed as usual beautiful cable,
[00:09:47.080 --> 00:09:55.280]   normal into the speaker which is usually not a good idea because if it frays or breaks you have to bring it to Apple to fix or Burke Burke could fix it.
[00:09:55.280 --> 00:09:59.080]   If you have a Burke round Apple sticker in there.
[00:09:59.080 --> 00:10:02.280]   So did you play it on a variety of music, Renee?
[00:10:02.280 --> 00:10:06.680]   Yeah, I asked it to play a bunch of like it asked to play a bunch of it starts off when you set it up.
[00:10:06.880 --> 00:10:14.080]   It asks you to ask for music right away because you don't have to do any sort of true play tuning or you put the little speaker in the room and try to find this.
[00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:23.880]   Let's look at that because she's showing the manual which is a simple trifold like most modern manuals but the setup is really cool.
[00:10:23.880 --> 00:10:25.680]   Yeah, tell us about that.
[00:10:25.680 --> 00:10:33.480]   So it asks you to ask for a song and then it tries to pick a song based on its understanding of music that you've liked in the past and as soon as it starts playing that song.
[00:10:33.680 --> 00:10:42.880]   It starts detecting the acoustics in the room and then it does all itself tuning and that takes between like one to three maybe five seconds and it has an accelerometer in it.
[00:10:42.880 --> 00:10:45.480]   So anytime you move it it'll automatically run.
[00:10:45.480 --> 00:10:48.480]   No, no, no, no, no, no separate audio run.
[00:10:48.680 --> 00:10:52.880]   It's like, it just does it on its own.
[00:10:52.880 --> 00:10:59.280]   I also note that it pairs instantly just like the AirPods do when you open up the phone.
[00:10:59.280 --> 00:11:01.480]   Yeah, it just pops up.
[00:11:01.480 --> 00:11:06.080]   So you do do you I think you'd have to have an iPhone or iPad right to use this?
[00:11:06.080 --> 00:11:07.080]   Yeah, you absolutely do.
[00:11:07.080 --> 00:11:07.880]   I have the whole setup.
[00:11:07.880 --> 00:11:12.080]   I put it up on i'm more on YouTube.com/i'm more video but you have an iPhone or iPad.
[00:11:12.080 --> 00:11:17.680]   The little AirPods like interface comes up and you just tap your way through it and there's a few choices to make and it's smart too.
[00:11:17.880 --> 00:11:27.480]   If you have accessibility turned on in your phone, it'll automatically enable accessibility or touch accommodations or any of the other accessibility features on the HomePod as it's setting it up.
[00:11:27.480 --> 00:11:34.080]   If you have series set to male American or female British, it'll copy that over for you while setting it up.
[00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:42.280]   Let me go to your I'm going to review because I want to show you're setting up of the HomePod instead of a set of hers.
[00:11:42.280 --> 00:11:43.880]   Well, mine is just the set up.
[00:11:43.880 --> 00:11:45.480]   So you don't have to sit through the unbox.
[00:11:45.680 --> 00:11:47.680]   I did a separate one just for the setup.
[00:11:47.680 --> 00:11:48.880]   Yeah, nice.
[00:11:48.880 --> 00:11:50.880]   But it works.
[00:11:50.880 --> 00:11:51.680]   Sorry.
[00:11:51.680 --> 00:12:05.880]   Oh, I was going to ask does when you when you select your when you select your first thing for it to play, is that going to is the genre going to influence how it sets up the device like it's this is going to be tuned towards, you know, folk acoustic as opposed to ear splitting metal.
[00:12:05.880 --> 00:12:10.680]   No, I mean, I just asked to play a podcast for us because of course I did.
[00:12:10.680 --> 00:12:12.280]   But so it's tuning.
[00:12:12.280 --> 00:12:14.080]   That's probably the wrong thing, right?
[00:12:14.280 --> 00:12:17.480]   No, totally. But then it'll as it as you play more human music, like,
[00:12:17.480 --> 00:12:19.280]   so continues to adjust.
[00:12:19.280 --> 00:12:28.680]   Yeah, if it needs to and as as it moves around or as a room changes, like if it's in the corner of a of a bookcase, it knows that compared to if it's on against a wall compared to it's in the middle of the room.
[00:12:28.680 --> 00:12:31.480]   It senses all those differences in this environment.
[00:12:31.480 --> 00:12:36.680]   And if it's in the middle of a room, for example, it will use those seven tweeters to send sound 360 degrees around.
[00:12:36.680 --> 00:12:39.880]   It's it's hard to think of it in terms of like stereo or 5.1.
[00:12:40.080 --> 00:12:45.280]   It definitely takes the mix into account. It always wants to represent what the artist wanted to do with the song.
[00:12:45.280 --> 00:12:50.080]   But then it takes that information and uses that to play sound in the room as best a can.
[00:12:50.080 --> 00:12:57.480]   And if it's against a wall, it'll bounce stuff off the wall to get the same sort of effect to do the center versus the ambient placement.
[00:12:57.480 --> 00:13:05.280]   So Renee, in his usual overachiever mode, wrote 10,000 words and a podcast and multiple videos.
[00:13:05.280 --> 00:13:08.280]   So you really have is this the setup video in here?
[00:13:08.480 --> 00:13:11.080]   This is the end of halfway through. If you go halfway through, it'll start the setup.
[00:13:11.080 --> 00:13:12.080]   Yeah.
[00:13:12.080 --> 00:13:16.280]   Yes, see, that's the look that I like with the slate wall behind you.
[00:13:16.280 --> 00:13:16.880]   I like that.
[00:13:16.880 --> 00:13:17.680]   That's what I'm going to have.
[00:13:17.680 --> 00:13:20.680]   I actually have an adapter to make that camera work with perfect.
[00:13:20.680 --> 00:13:23.680]   So there's that little trifold again.
[00:13:23.680 --> 00:13:25.280]   Yeah, but you know, it's nice.
[00:13:25.280 --> 00:13:27.080]   That's all you need.
[00:13:27.080 --> 00:13:29.480]   So would you use this instead of your stereo?
[00:13:29.480 --> 00:13:31.080]   I mean, is it that much better?
[00:13:31.080 --> 00:13:35.080]   Well, the other one point out too is it makes this little tone when you first start setting it up.
[00:13:35.280 --> 00:13:40.280]   It is the same thing as the pattern on an Apple Watch or iPhone when you set it up or the code you type in for an Apple TV.
[00:13:40.280 --> 00:13:44.680]   So it just knows that it's caring to that device and you don't have to do anything else about it.
[00:13:44.680 --> 00:13:45.880]   Oh, you also place it.
[00:13:45.880 --> 00:13:48.280]   It's asking where are you putting in the house?
[00:13:48.280 --> 00:13:51.080]   If you have home kits set up, it'll ask you what room you're putting it in.
[00:13:51.080 --> 00:13:54.680]   That way, if you say turn off the lights, it knows you mean the lights in that room.
[00:13:54.680 --> 00:13:59.080]   You can say turn off all the lights if you really want all the lights, but it's aware of which home kit room it's in, for example.
[00:13:59.080 --> 00:14:02.280]   Because of course, Apple wants you to have one for every room.
[00:14:02.280 --> 00:14:04.080]   Well, it's also useful for security.
[00:14:04.280 --> 00:14:08.480]   So, for example, you can say, I only want, I don't want to let anybody airplay to it.
[00:14:08.480 --> 00:14:17.680]   I want to only let people who are on my network, which means you've shared your Wi-Fi password with them and you trust them or I only want to share it with people who have shared my home kit home with, which is generally only your family.
[00:14:17.680 --> 00:14:21.880]   And that prevents like Jim Dowerimple driving up and streaming Aussie Osborne to you in the middle of the night.
[00:14:21.880 --> 00:14:23.080]   Which he would.
[00:14:23.080 --> 00:14:25.080]   If he could, you know, he would.
[00:14:25.080 --> 00:14:25.880]   He totally would.
[00:14:25.880 --> 00:14:28.680]   He wouldn't come back to Canada to do it, but yeah, no, he totally would.
[00:14:28.680 --> 00:14:29.480]   Hi, Renee.
[00:14:29.480 --> 00:14:30.280]   That's cute.
[00:14:31.680 --> 00:14:34.280]   Yeah, and it says, you know, it says like, you can't tell, but I'm smiling.
[00:14:34.280 --> 00:14:36.680]   It does all these little sort of, it's very human.
[00:14:36.680 --> 00:14:43.880]   I mean, like, that's the one thing that I think Siri and Amazon get really right and that they make it almost like a character that you want to talk with.
[00:14:43.880 --> 00:14:46.280]   And I get that Google is like, it's a Star Trek computer.
[00:14:46.280 --> 00:14:47.680]   But I find when it's a car.
[00:14:47.680 --> 00:14:48.080]   Yeah.
[00:14:48.080 --> 00:14:48.280]   Yeah.
[00:14:48.280 --> 00:14:54.080]   When I find that a character is just more relatable and someone was asking me, like, they find it very uncomfortable to talk to it.
[00:14:54.080 --> 00:15:01.480]   But I think if you think about it, like, Jim and synergy or, you know, Michael Knight and Kit, once it has a personality,
[00:15:01.480 --> 00:15:03.280]   it becomes more approachable to you.
[00:15:03.280 --> 00:15:08.280]   You, it sounds like you've got a new friend, Renee.
[00:15:08.280 --> 00:15:10.480]   So I have a sonos.
[00:15:10.480 --> 00:15:12.880]   I don't have a set up now, but I have a sonos home theater system.
[00:15:12.880 --> 00:15:13.980]   I've been using it for years.
[00:15:13.980 --> 00:15:15.580]   I have like five or seven.
[00:15:15.580 --> 00:15:16.680]   So I'm speaking by now.
[00:15:16.680 --> 00:15:17.280]   And yeah.
[00:15:17.280 --> 00:15:23.280]   And it sounds it sounds unmistakably even to my non audiophile years, unmistakably better than Sonos.
[00:15:23.280 --> 00:15:26.080]   There was an audio file on Reddit who said it was about 20% better.
[00:15:26.080 --> 00:15:28.880]   I don't know what that means, but I can hear that it's cleaner.
[00:15:28.880 --> 00:15:29.880]   It's CRISPR.
[00:15:30.380 --> 00:15:31.980]   It just, it sounds pressure and brighter.
[00:15:31.980 --> 00:15:34.880]   Does the bass, yeah, I could hear the brightness on it.
[00:15:34.880 --> 00:15:35.980]   But how about the bass?
[00:15:35.980 --> 00:15:36.880]   The bass is good.
[00:15:36.880 --> 00:15:41.380]   The only thing that I find weird about the bass is I'm used to having a sonos sub and, you know, that's big and boom.
[00:15:41.380 --> 00:15:47.980]   And it rocks the floor and Apple went out of their way to make this not like it sits on the shelf and it's not supposed to knock itself off the shelf.
[00:15:47.980 --> 00:15:48.580]   I can't.
[00:15:48.580 --> 00:15:49.980]   So I do miss that.
[00:15:49.980 --> 00:15:53.980]   But if I if I didn't have Sonos, I would get this immediately.
[00:15:53.980 --> 00:16:00.280]   And if I even though I have Sonos when AirPlay 2 comes out, I would strongly consider I'm, you know, I'm in.
[00:16:00.280 --> 00:16:05.080]   I'm going to do this anyway, but I was calling to consider a paired match of home pods instead of a sonos theater.
[00:16:05.080 --> 00:16:10.580]   I just wish Apple had a dedicated sound bar mode that if I wanted to, I want to say just right now, AirPlay is great.
[00:16:10.580 --> 00:16:11.180]   It's sticky.
[00:16:11.180 --> 00:16:12.780]   So you pair it to your Apple TV.
[00:16:12.780 --> 00:16:13.980]   It'll keep doing airplay.
[00:16:13.980 --> 00:16:17.780]   If you ask questions, it'll pause what you're watching, answer the question.
[00:16:17.780 --> 00:16:19.280]   It'll say play pause, all those things.
[00:16:19.280 --> 00:16:26.480]   But if you do anything else with it, if you do a different airplay stream where you asked for Apple music, you then have to go on and repair it and it's just swipe swipe click.
[00:16:26.480 --> 00:16:30.980]   It's not hard, but it's annoying enough that I wish I could just say dedicate this home pod to the TV.
[00:16:30.980 --> 00:16:31.880]   I know what I'm doing.
[00:16:31.880 --> 00:16:33.080]   Pretend it's a sound bar.
[00:16:33.080 --> 00:16:33.380]   Right.
[00:16:33.380 --> 00:16:36.280]   I now series built in.
[00:16:36.280 --> 00:16:38.580]   Is it the full Siri or is it a limited Siri?
[00:16:38.580 --> 00:16:47.480]   It's a series still and this is one of my biggest frustrations that Siri is still completely inconsistent across platforms like the Mac can't do home kit for no particular reason that I can figure out.
[00:16:47.480 --> 00:16:49.580]   I mean, maybe there's a reason I just can't figure out what it is.
[00:16:49.580 --> 00:16:54.580]   And there's different so it is it has the best Siri functionality right now for music.
[00:16:54.580 --> 00:16:56.180]   I think that's filtering into the iPhone as well.
[00:16:56.180 --> 00:17:00.980]   So it has deep music knowledge and it has what I would actually call second generation AI for music.
[00:17:00.980 --> 00:17:13.080]   And that we talked about this previously, but right now a lot of devices are good at Leo said play black Sabbath and they get better and better at knowing that you said black Sabbath and understanding your pronunciation, but they haven't really gotten better at knowing that you like black Sabbath.
[00:17:13.080 --> 00:17:17.180]   You want to hear that more and you want to hear music that's similar to that more and that's what home pod does.
[00:17:17.180 --> 00:17:25.180]   It starts building up a library of what you ask it to play for and what you like and then start suggesting music or if you just say play music, it'll try to pick music that it thinks you like.
[00:17:25.180 --> 00:17:27.180]   That's a really important step for this.
[00:17:27.180 --> 00:17:35.180]   But in other areas like Siri kit right now is limited to only third party messaging apps like WhatsApp, not apps like Evernote and to do apps like things.
[00:17:35.180 --> 00:17:50.180]   You can't do there is no integration with Siri kit for restaurants or for ride hailing and maybe that's just Apple trying to figure out the completely voice only interface without a screen for it and maybe we'll get that a WDC, but also like audio serial Siri kit still isn't there.
[00:17:50.180 --> 00:17:56.180]   You can't do native Spotify or native audible or any of your native overcast if that's what you want to do.
[00:17:56.180 --> 00:17:58.180]   I think that's the area where Apple really has to pick up.
[00:17:58.180 --> 00:18:01.180]   You can send and read messages, add reminders, create notes.
[00:18:01.180 --> 00:18:03.180]   Can you make phone calls?
[00:18:03.180 --> 00:18:12.180]   You can't initiate a phone call, but you can use it like a once you have a phone call, it becomes an audio source like you could switch to air positive, switch to scot your phone, you can switch to home pod.
[00:18:12.180 --> 00:18:14.180]   And it has them and you can use its mic for the phone.
[00:18:14.180 --> 00:18:15.180]   Yes.
[00:18:15.180 --> 00:18:16.180]   Yeah, I tried it was friend of the earlier set it sound.
[00:18:16.180 --> 00:18:19.180]   It was across the room set it sounded big and boomy, but it wasn't bad for across the room.
[00:18:19.180 --> 00:18:23.180]   Well, it's got what how many mics three four it's an array six array mics.
[00:18:23.180 --> 00:18:25.180]   It's got six seven tweeters going around the bottom.
[00:18:25.180 --> 00:18:29.180]   Seven tweeters six mics and then an incursion something woofer.
[00:18:29.180 --> 00:18:31.180]   High excursion.
[00:18:31.180 --> 00:18:32.180]   High excursion.
[00:18:32.180 --> 00:18:36.180]   Yeah, woofer, which sounds like it's going on a trip, but it's just lots of.
[00:18:36.180 --> 00:18:42.180]   I only went by the audio nerds who like I was in the analyst group for this because like the home pod's not coming out and fun.
[00:18:42.180 --> 00:18:45.180]   I didn't do a review of fun to hang out with those guys.
[00:18:45.180 --> 00:18:48.180]   Yeah, but they are all like so they've been on this tour from eight different vendors, you know, and they'd see a lot of people.
[00:18:48.180 --> 00:18:53.180]   And watching them sort of nerd out over the technical because they had a disassembled home pod in front of us.
[00:18:53.180 --> 00:18:56.180]   Oh, stick up the pieces and check it out.
[00:18:56.180 --> 00:19:00.180]   And they were just nerding out to and you know when the nerds nerd out that you're doing something.
[00:19:00.180 --> 00:19:05.180]   Was it the consensus of the audio files in the group that this did in fact live up to its hype?
[00:19:05.180 --> 00:19:11.180]   Yeah, I think even the biggest critics I've seen like even people who aren't happy with Siri or other aspects of it like in Nilei pettels review too.
[00:19:11.180 --> 00:19:12.180]   He said it's one of the.
[00:19:12.180 --> 00:19:13.180]   And he's a huge speaker nerd.
[00:19:13.180 --> 00:19:17.180]   Yeah, he said it sounded great and he's the kind of guy who would have a vacuum tube amplifier on his desk.
[00:19:17.180 --> 00:19:18.180]   He does.
[00:19:18.180 --> 00:19:23.180]   In fact, he said he has an analog stereo system in his video, which is way over produced.
[00:19:23.180 --> 00:19:24.180]   I'm just jealous.
[00:19:24.180 --> 00:19:25.180]   Looks like a Netflix show.
[00:19:25.180 --> 00:19:30.180]   I know he actually does a think a very good thing, which is he plays the comparison.
[00:19:30.180 --> 00:19:34.180]   He has all the same music playing with all these different speakers.
[00:19:34.180 --> 00:19:38.180]   So you can actually listen, although playing it on my Macbook, they all sounded the same.
[00:19:38.180 --> 00:19:39.180]   But I got that.
[00:19:39.180 --> 00:19:40.180]   I got it.
[00:19:40.180 --> 00:19:47.180]   It's a little bit easier.
[00:19:47.180 --> 00:19:50.180]   They did it with the play three and with the echo.
[00:19:50.180 --> 00:19:55.180]   And then this last week they did it with the Google Max, the Sonos one and the new echo.
[00:19:55.180 --> 00:19:58.180]   And I think Sonos is just a little bit in just in terms of speaker quality.
[00:19:58.180 --> 00:19:59.180]   It's a little bit behind Apple.
[00:19:59.180 --> 00:20:02.180]   The Google Max and the echo, I don't think should be in the same category.
[00:20:02.180 --> 00:20:04.180]   They're more like speakers that make sound.
[00:20:04.180 --> 00:20:05.180]   Yeah, not even close.
[00:20:05.180 --> 00:20:09.180]   And the Google Max is huge, but it doesn't sound anywhere nearly as good as Sonos or home pod.
[00:20:09.180 --> 00:20:11.180]   And I've ordered them and 350 bucks.
[00:20:11.180 --> 00:20:12.180]   It's not cheap.
[00:20:12.180 --> 00:20:16.780]   On the other hand, if it's really a good speaker, 350 bucks is not expensive, frankly, for a
[00:20:16.780 --> 00:20:17.780]   good speaker.
[00:20:17.780 --> 00:20:20.180]   It's not stereo, which some people...
[00:20:20.180 --> 00:20:22.180]   So that is super confusing to me.
[00:20:22.180 --> 00:20:24.180]   And I spend a lot of time asking about it.
[00:20:24.180 --> 00:20:26.180]   And Apple is using these terms, I think, in a really bad way.
[00:20:26.180 --> 00:20:27.180]   I think it would do the...
[00:20:27.180 --> 00:20:30.180]   I think it does other disservice to the information out there.
[00:20:30.180 --> 00:20:32.180]   When they mean it's mono, they mean there's one speaker.
[00:20:32.180 --> 00:20:34.180]   When they mean it's stereo, they mean there's two speakers.
[00:20:34.180 --> 00:20:36.180]   That's nothing to do with the audio coming out of those speakers.
[00:20:36.180 --> 00:20:37.180]   They're just using literally mono.
[00:20:37.180 --> 00:20:42.180]   If I play a stereo song on it, am I going to hear left and right now?
[00:20:42.180 --> 00:20:44.180]   Yes, it's going to take the left and right channels.
[00:20:44.180 --> 00:20:46.940]   It's going to do the center first, and then it's going to beam the left and right channels
[00:20:46.940 --> 00:20:49.180]   either straight out or bounce them off all the things on the video.
[00:20:49.180 --> 00:20:50.180]   So it might sound like stereo?
[00:20:50.180 --> 00:20:53.180]   Yeah, it's weird, though, because you can actually walk around it.
[00:20:53.180 --> 00:20:56.180]   And so if you walk behind it, it might be the opposite channels.
[00:20:56.180 --> 00:20:57.180]   If you have it in the middle of the room.
[00:20:57.180 --> 00:20:59.180]   But it tries to put stuff in the right space.
[00:20:59.180 --> 00:21:00.180]   Oh, I can't wait to hear that.
[00:21:00.180 --> 00:21:03.340]   And some people find that off-putting because they said in a concert you don't get to get
[00:21:03.340 --> 00:21:04.900]   up and walk around an orchestra.
[00:21:04.900 --> 00:21:05.900]   You just don't do that.
[00:21:05.900 --> 00:21:06.900]   Well, you would if you could.
[00:21:06.900 --> 00:21:07.900]   Yeah, totally.
[00:21:07.900 --> 00:21:13.740]   And when you have two of them, it doesn't make it stereo in the left-right channels sense.
[00:21:13.740 --> 00:21:17.140]   It just, because there's two sources now, it can better model the room and it can go
[00:21:17.140 --> 00:21:18.140]   interesting.
[00:21:18.140 --> 00:21:20.300]   And you can add three or four when you get there.
[00:21:20.300 --> 00:21:22.420]   You have to re-understand what stereo means now.
[00:21:22.420 --> 00:21:25.900]   I mean, they're using a classic definition that I think nobody understands, and that
[00:21:25.900 --> 00:21:27.500]   led to a lot of confusion over the speakers.
[00:21:27.500 --> 00:21:31.540]   Well, normally you wouldn't have what you want is separation between left and right.
[00:21:31.540 --> 00:21:33.740]   And normally with a single speaker, you can't.
[00:21:33.740 --> 00:21:37.380]   But they're doing something so different now with tuning and aiming.
[00:21:37.380 --> 00:21:39.020]   And they're aiming at the walls.
[00:21:39.020 --> 00:21:45.220]   Remember, Bose very famously 30, 40 years ago had their Bose 901 speakers were direct
[00:21:45.220 --> 00:21:46.220]   reflecting.
[00:21:46.220 --> 00:21:50.380]   They used, they said, you need to put them in against a wall in a corner because some
[00:21:50.380 --> 00:21:54.140]   of the sound is intentionally reflected off the back wall for spatial.
[00:21:54.140 --> 00:21:56.540]   Well, this is that in spades now.
[00:21:56.540 --> 00:21:59.980]   They've got, they can go 360 degrees around the speaker.
[00:21:59.980 --> 00:22:03.500]   It's like, the only analogy I could make is it's like portrait mode where it takes a camera
[00:22:03.500 --> 00:22:06.700]   that has no native ability to do bokeh or anything like that.
[00:22:06.700 --> 00:22:10.260]   And through computational power and machine learning, let's do that.
[00:22:10.260 --> 00:22:15.180]   And this is a small device that has no business being able to do spatial audio and through
[00:22:15.180 --> 00:22:19.900]   sheer will of technology and programming get it to do much more than the atoms themselves
[00:22:19.900 --> 00:22:20.900]   are capable of.
[00:22:20.900 --> 00:22:23.460]   And I think this is just the beginning of all these companies, sort of making all these
[00:22:23.460 --> 00:22:24.460]   products computational.
[00:22:24.460 --> 00:22:27.220]   So in the week you've had, have you listened to a variety of music?
[00:22:27.220 --> 00:22:29.220]   Is there one that sounds better than the others?
[00:22:29.220 --> 00:22:32.300]   Or should we just ignore anything you have to say because you're not a stereo fan?
[00:22:32.300 --> 00:22:34.380]   Again, no, I mean, like it just sounds really good.
[00:22:34.380 --> 00:22:36.860]   And I like, I don't have favorites.
[00:22:36.860 --> 00:22:37.860]   I like variety.
[00:22:37.860 --> 00:22:40.140]   Like my variety, a bunch of different things.
[00:22:40.140 --> 00:22:44.900]   So I've listened to jazz in hip hop and classic walking stations for everything.
[00:22:44.900 --> 00:22:48.020]   And when I've been watching the videos, I've been like people have been asking for stuff
[00:22:48.020 --> 00:22:49.820]   and I've been asking to play it.
[00:22:49.820 --> 00:22:51.540]   And so far, I haven't found anything that sounds bad.
[00:22:51.540 --> 00:22:52.540]   I'm not the best judge.
[00:22:52.540 --> 00:22:54.740]   So I wait for people like you or people who are really good at audio.
[00:22:54.740 --> 00:22:57.940]   I don't want Andy to listen to Don D'Amaro and tell us what it sounds like.
[00:22:57.940 --> 00:22:58.940]   That's what I'm looking for.
[00:22:58.940 --> 00:22:59.940]   She's in the room, Leo.
[00:22:59.940 --> 00:23:00.940]   She's in the room.
[00:23:00.940 --> 00:23:02.940]   I'll take it.
[00:23:02.940 --> 00:23:03.940]   Yeah.
[00:23:03.940 --> 00:23:12.700]   I mean, this is an example of how Apple could really reinvent what a sound system is.
[00:23:12.700 --> 00:23:17.100]   And that's the hope is that they're doing that and they're not hyping it.
[00:23:17.100 --> 00:23:20.340]   It's the question of hype versus hope.
[00:23:20.340 --> 00:23:25.500]   They could be hyping this beyond its capabilities or it's the latter.
[00:23:25.500 --> 00:23:29.740]   They're doing enough computationally here with an A8 chip.
[00:23:29.740 --> 00:23:30.740]   And it's just the beginning.
[00:23:30.740 --> 00:23:33.500]   I'm sure Google's going to follow fast with this technology because their machine learning
[00:23:33.500 --> 00:23:36.220]   is fabulous and the other companies someone else is going to keep going.
[00:23:36.220 --> 00:23:37.220]   It's not exactly machine learning.
[00:23:37.220 --> 00:23:42.420]   I mean, it kind of goes back to the binorial sound and also it's not exactly what others
[00:23:42.420 --> 00:23:47.180]   have done so far with sound bars, which is simulate a sound stage either.
[00:23:47.180 --> 00:23:50.100]   It sounds like something even newer than that.
[00:23:50.100 --> 00:23:51.100]   I don't know.
[00:23:51.100 --> 00:23:53.900]   I like the phrase computational audio.
[00:23:53.900 --> 00:23:54.900]   Yeah.
[00:23:54.900 --> 00:23:57.220]   Just like computational photography.
[00:23:57.220 --> 00:23:59.420]   It's a new thing.
[00:23:59.420 --> 00:24:05.140]   Rick's, I like the fact that there's the entire definition of a sound system is being changed,
[00:24:05.140 --> 00:24:07.100]   not even necessarily through a home pod.
[00:24:07.100 --> 00:24:11.620]   But the idea that it doesn't even seem to make as big a difference, as big a deal that
[00:24:11.620 --> 00:24:16.740]   there's no left, distinct left and right speaker because how many places in your house
[00:24:16.740 --> 00:24:21.380]   are you going to do is listen to music by sitting in a chair that's in the sweet spot
[00:24:21.380 --> 00:24:26.340]   within a stereo field as opposed to I just want to be able to be in this room and join
[00:24:26.340 --> 00:24:31.980]   my life reading a book or getting up to get coffee or walking over to my desk.
[00:24:31.980 --> 00:24:33.900]   But there's always really good audio in the room.
[00:24:33.900 --> 00:24:41.140]   I think that these really good, really good, like Bluetooth speakers that have been taking
[00:24:41.140 --> 00:24:46.300]   over for the past three or four years have really helped us change our attitude to this
[00:24:46.300 --> 00:24:51.020]   isn't the one, the one altar of stereo speakers in the good living room that you're not allowed
[00:24:51.020 --> 00:24:52.020]   to sit in.
[00:24:52.020 --> 00:24:59.020]   This is not necessarily as good as those big speakers, but plenty good, but it's exactly
[00:24:59.020 --> 00:25:00.580]   where you need it to be.
[00:25:00.580 --> 00:25:01.580]   And it could be better.
[00:25:01.580 --> 00:25:05.180]   I mean, honestly, the kitchen's a good example.
[00:25:05.180 --> 00:25:09.820]   You're listening to music in the kitchen, you're moving around as you cook and serve.
[00:25:09.820 --> 00:25:12.340]   If it feels the room, right, Renee?
[00:25:12.340 --> 00:25:13.340]   I mean, it's not a question.
[00:25:13.340 --> 00:25:14.340]   Yeah, I'll rump on I try it.
[00:25:14.340 --> 00:25:18.220]   Like we spend about five minutes searching for dead spots and we couldn't find any.
[00:25:18.220 --> 00:25:21.980]   It was a relatively big room.
[00:25:21.980 --> 00:25:24.580]   Not merely dead spots, but the sound is big enough.
[00:25:24.580 --> 00:25:25.580]   So it doesn't.
[00:25:25.580 --> 00:25:26.580]   Yes.
[00:25:26.580 --> 00:25:29.940]   And does it sound like it's coming from that speaker over there?
[00:25:29.940 --> 00:25:33.260]   The only time I felt weird about it is when I synced it to the television, then put it
[00:25:33.260 --> 00:25:35.020]   behind me and I stood between the television and the speaker.
[00:25:35.020 --> 00:25:36.020]   That would be weird.
[00:25:36.020 --> 00:25:39.980]   Because that's not what I'm used to for that experience to sound like.
[00:25:39.980 --> 00:25:40.980]   So that was weird.
[00:25:40.980 --> 00:25:42.940]   But otherwise, I haven't even noticed.
[00:25:42.940 --> 00:25:46.140]   And I think like when they explained the design goal, again, it started like six years
[00:25:46.140 --> 00:25:50.540]   ago and their only question was, can we make a speaker that you can put anywhere that
[00:25:50.540 --> 00:25:53.940]   is super easy to set up and that sounds great no matter where you put it.
[00:25:53.940 --> 00:25:57.100]   And that was a super big challenge and they had to make a prototype, get it signed off
[00:25:57.100 --> 00:26:00.620]   by executives, get the go ahead to make the product.
[00:26:00.620 --> 00:26:01.820]   But I think that's what they've achieved.
[00:26:01.820 --> 00:26:05.420]   If you don't have anything, and if you're involved in the Apple ecosystem, you can just
[00:26:05.420 --> 00:26:09.220]   go buy one of these, stick it almost anywhere that you want, press a couple buttons on your
[00:26:09.220 --> 00:26:10.220]   iPhone.
[00:26:10.220 --> 00:26:12.500]   It'll be set up and playing really, really good sounding music no matter where you put
[00:26:12.500 --> 00:26:13.500]   it.
[00:26:13.500 --> 00:26:16.220]   And then you can pick it up and change rooms, take it other places, put it on your patio,
[00:26:16.220 --> 00:26:17.460]   stick it in your kitchen, whatever.
[00:26:17.460 --> 00:26:22.780]   And it'll still automatically sound great wherever you put it.
[00:26:22.780 --> 00:26:26.740]   I know they're very disciplined at Apple and I would doubt that they would in any way give
[00:26:26.740 --> 00:26:27.740]   you any hints.
[00:26:27.740 --> 00:26:31.220]   But I wonder if they're thinking of making bigger ones.
[00:26:31.220 --> 00:26:34.900]   I know we're small, and I'll ask for smaller ones that they could put like in a child's
[00:26:34.900 --> 00:26:37.580]   room or their room or take on the camper.
[00:26:37.580 --> 00:26:42.060]   I would love for them to be a home bar that would be like a dedicated sound bar for a
[00:26:42.060 --> 00:26:43.060]   television.
[00:26:43.060 --> 00:26:46.380]   There's some really cool old Dolby Atmos stuff that's being done by Yamaha in Soundbar,
[00:26:46.380 --> 00:26:47.380]   a sound bar format.
[00:26:47.380 --> 00:26:51.540]   I think there's a lot like iPod started off with just one thing that was incredibly limited.
[00:26:51.540 --> 00:26:52.940]   And look what that became.
[00:26:52.940 --> 00:26:57.020]   So I always have high hopes that we're at the beginning of something and not an ending.
[00:26:57.020 --> 00:27:00.660]   I was surprised that the HomePod didn't work well.
[00:27:00.660 --> 00:27:04.660]   It didn't work what I consider to be really well with Apple TV.
[00:27:04.660 --> 00:27:10.540]   Neelai's review was speaking about how it only interacts with it as an airplane device.
[00:27:10.540 --> 00:27:14.580]   And if you use the, if you then use it for something else, then you have to go back into
[00:27:14.580 --> 00:27:20.100]   Apple TV and remind it to please use the HomePod again as a default device.
[00:27:20.100 --> 00:27:24.580]   I would love to, I would love if the next product that they made in this line were sort
[00:27:24.580 --> 00:27:29.260]   of like an Apple TV directed thing that was, understands that you're going to be putting
[00:27:29.260 --> 00:27:34.940]   this underneath or next or around a TV set and make sure it's the best.
[00:27:34.940 --> 00:27:41.700]   It uses that computational audio for soundtracks and for explosions and stuff like that.
[00:27:41.700 --> 00:27:45.780]   I've been using it like that for a week just as an Apple TV speaker and it's fine.
[00:27:45.780 --> 00:27:46.780]   It's sticky.
[00:27:46.780 --> 00:27:51.100]   It'll stay attached unless you use a different airplane device or you ask it to do something.
[00:27:51.100 --> 00:27:55.940]   And then you have to go swipe swipe, three swipes and a click to make it pair again.
[00:27:55.940 --> 00:27:58.540]   But it'd be nice if you could just say leave it paired.
[00:27:58.540 --> 00:28:01.940]   And one thing I forgot is as much as people are saying it's an Apple only thing, most
[00:28:01.940 --> 00:28:05.060]   of HTC's devices have supported AirPlay for a while now.
[00:28:05.060 --> 00:28:10.140]   The HTC 11 supports it as well and the 10 did and also double twist and there's a variety
[00:28:10.140 --> 00:28:11.140]   of Android apps.
[00:28:11.140 --> 00:28:14.300]   So if you have people in your family and you think it's a deal breaker that you don't
[00:28:14.300 --> 00:28:18.180]   have AirPlay, there's chances that they might at least have AirPlay compatibility.
[00:28:18.180 --> 00:28:19.180]   So you can check into that.
[00:28:19.180 --> 00:28:24.060]   It does look like the HomePod is going to be, actually I'm now excited about getting
[00:28:24.060 --> 00:28:25.060]   one.
[00:28:25.060 --> 00:28:27.460]   I'm encouraged by the very, very positive reviews.
[00:28:27.460 --> 00:28:32.260]   It's hard to imagine a device that small providing good sound.
[00:28:32.260 --> 00:28:37.820]   What is funny because you'd expect Apple to make computer speakers.
[00:28:37.820 --> 00:28:43.340]   This team I think one of the first things we saw was the iPad Pro where it had the four
[00:28:43.340 --> 00:28:45.340]   speakers and you could turn it and it would maintain.
[00:28:45.340 --> 00:28:49.300]   But I was like a little pair of these with a subwoofer for my iMac.
[00:28:49.300 --> 00:28:50.300]   Totally.
[00:28:50.300 --> 00:28:54.220]   Oh, the iMac Pro has got another one of their products and that team works on the iMac
[00:28:54.220 --> 00:28:55.220]   Pro's speaker.
[00:28:55.220 --> 00:28:56.220]   Yeah, it sounds, oh, do they really?
[00:28:56.220 --> 00:28:57.220]   Because it sounds pretty good.
[00:28:57.220 --> 00:29:02.100]   I mean, it's not as good as my audio engines, but it's good enough.
[00:29:02.100 --> 00:29:04.180]   And I think it's microphone is very good.
[00:29:04.180 --> 00:29:06.460]   They're using an array of mic in there too.
[00:29:06.460 --> 00:29:10.780]   The nice thing with AirPlay 2 when it finally ships is that Sonos said they'll support it
[00:29:10.780 --> 00:29:12.300]   and there'll be third parties that support it.
[00:29:12.300 --> 00:29:15.380]   So you could just add this, like I don't want to replace this Sonos, it's expensive, but
[00:29:15.380 --> 00:29:19.060]   I could just add this in and then choose where I want the audio to go if it's Sonos.
[00:29:19.060 --> 00:29:24.060]   Although you have to think that this is going to replace Sonos ultimately.
[00:29:24.060 --> 00:29:27.900]   They don't have, so I always think that the advantage is the companies that have secondary
[00:29:27.900 --> 00:29:30.300]   tertiary, you know, all these different sources of income.
[00:29:30.300 --> 00:29:34.140]   It's really hard to be palm and be in mobile, but it's really easy to be Apple or Samsung
[00:29:34.140 --> 00:29:35.140]   or Microsoft.
[00:29:35.140 --> 00:29:39.380]   And when you say supports, okay, I got to understand this.
[00:29:39.380 --> 00:29:46.620]   So it supports the Apple TV in that you can have the TV play to it.
[00:29:46.620 --> 00:29:47.620]   Can you play it?
[00:29:47.620 --> 00:29:49.740]   You wouldn't want to play it to the TV.
[00:29:49.740 --> 00:29:51.300]   No, it only goes away.
[00:29:51.300 --> 00:29:52.300]   It can control it.
[00:29:52.300 --> 00:29:54.780]   You can do pause play and things like that, but that's okay.
[00:29:54.780 --> 00:29:59.980]   So it's a TV speaker in that sense and it supports AirPlay in the sense that you can
[00:29:59.980 --> 00:30:04.260]   AirPlay to it from an AirPlay compatible device and it will play the sound.
[00:30:04.260 --> 00:30:08.300]   So if I wanted to listen to my audio books, for instance, I would just get my iPhone
[00:30:08.300 --> 00:30:12.100]   10, launch Audible, and then tell it to play through the HomePod.
[00:30:12.100 --> 00:30:13.100]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:30:13.100 --> 00:30:14.100]   Not the AirPlay to the world.
[00:30:14.100 --> 00:30:15.100]   I'm going to say.
[00:30:15.100 --> 00:30:16.820]   You've ruined the multi-device and that'll be nice.
[00:30:16.820 --> 00:30:20.300]   No Spotify though at this launch, only Apple Music.
[00:30:20.300 --> 00:30:24.940]   In fact, I subscribed to Apple Music just so because I'm getting the HomePod.
[00:30:24.940 --> 00:30:25.940]   Which is kind of an Apple plan.
[00:30:25.940 --> 00:30:26.940]   I get the feeling of the whole.
[00:30:26.940 --> 00:30:29.340]   Well, I think a lot of people talked about lock.
[00:30:29.340 --> 00:30:32.980]   And my sense is that it took so much work for them to build out what they wanted to do
[00:30:32.980 --> 00:30:34.140]   with this product.
[00:30:34.140 --> 00:30:38.020]   When Apple Music, they had complete access to everything about it, the catalog, the metadata,
[00:30:38.020 --> 00:30:39.580]   the file format, how they're going to stream it.
[00:30:39.580 --> 00:30:44.020]   They could have absolute control to make it work exactly the way they wanted.
[00:30:44.020 --> 00:30:47.180]   And now they've put the product out and I think it wouldn't surprise me if at WWDC they
[00:30:47.180 --> 00:30:48.620]   go, "Hey Siri, get for audio.
[00:30:48.620 --> 00:30:50.180]   No, everybody's invited."
[00:30:50.180 --> 00:30:55.020]   But it's not uncommon for like iPhone 1 or Apple TV 1 to be very dedicated to Apple until
[00:30:55.020 --> 00:30:57.420]   they figure out all the problems they have with it.
[00:30:57.420 --> 00:30:58.420]   Yeah.
[00:30:58.420 --> 00:31:00.140]   I'm not sure it's lock in per se.
[00:31:00.140 --> 00:31:02.180]   I think that remains to be seen.
[00:31:02.180 --> 00:31:05.860]   I agree with all of what Renee's been saying.
[00:31:05.860 --> 00:31:09.140]   As I said before, particularly about like the Apple Watch.
[00:31:09.140 --> 00:31:13.620]   If they get the hardware right, that's the hardest thing to completely rethink or radically
[00:31:13.620 --> 00:31:14.620]   alter.
[00:31:14.620 --> 00:31:18.860]   As long as it's a good container for the software, you intend to pour into it for the next one,
[00:31:18.860 --> 00:31:20.820]   two or three years, that's fine.
[00:31:20.820 --> 00:31:27.260]   So as long as Apple gains our trust by rolling out new features that we're expecting today
[00:31:27.260 --> 00:31:29.380]   over the next year, that's fine.
[00:31:29.380 --> 00:31:32.820]   At the same time, I don't think it would have been difficult to make it work as a Bluetooth
[00:31:32.820 --> 00:31:34.900]   device, a Bluetooth audio device.
[00:31:34.900 --> 00:31:39.700]   I don't think it would have been that difficult to support Spotify at launch, but maybe it's
[00:31:39.700 --> 00:31:41.580]   because they want that to happen.
[00:31:41.580 --> 00:31:46.140]   They want Spotify to provide that functionality through a standard API that they intend to
[00:31:46.140 --> 00:31:49.220]   offer to all developers at WWDC.
[00:31:49.220 --> 00:31:54.900]   So, I mean, and also as much as I'm saying, I don't think this is lock in.
[00:31:54.900 --> 00:32:01.740]   We're still waiting for support for anything other than an iPhone on the Apple Watch, even
[00:32:01.740 --> 00:32:07.100]   though it would really be a natural fit, a natural progression from, it doesn't matter
[00:32:07.100 --> 00:32:08.860]   what kind of computer you have, you can have an iPhone.
[00:32:08.860 --> 00:32:13.100]   It doesn't matter what kind of computer you have, you can have an iPod, but there's, but
[00:32:13.100 --> 00:32:17.300]   the Apple Watch, you have to have an iPhone.
[00:32:17.300 --> 00:32:20.660]   So I think it remains to be seen, but I don't think I would be so quick to say that this
[00:32:20.660 --> 00:32:21.820]   is all about lock in.
[00:32:21.820 --> 00:32:25.540]   I don't think this is how I feel on any given day.
[00:32:25.540 --> 00:32:33.780]   My current belief is number one reason is the experience isn't seem like Bluetooth experience
[00:32:33.780 --> 00:32:37.380]   is bad or the experience isn't everything Apple wants it to be.
[00:32:37.380 --> 00:32:39.300]   But also it doesn't hurt.
[00:32:39.300 --> 00:32:43.340]   Number two reason, it doesn't hurt that it encourages lock in.
[00:32:43.340 --> 00:32:48.220]   That's not a negative and Apple can see that as gravy, let's say.
[00:32:48.220 --> 00:32:51.220]   But I do, I think the number one reason, I'm going to give them credit that the number
[00:32:51.220 --> 00:32:53.900]   one reason is really that it's just not as good a user experience.
[00:32:53.900 --> 00:32:58.420]   Well, you can also look at like, I mean, Apple TV supports TV programming from all different
[00:32:58.420 --> 00:32:59.420]   vendors now.
[00:32:59.420 --> 00:33:00.740]   AirPods let you stream over Bluetooth.
[00:33:00.740 --> 00:33:03.100]   I think they make the decision on a product by product basis.
[00:33:03.100 --> 00:33:06.620]   And I think like Apple Watch, they're going to drive it to be an independent device and
[00:33:06.620 --> 00:33:08.100]   they just don't want to put it.
[00:33:08.100 --> 00:33:09.980]   Don't get me wrong, Steve Jobs were still there.
[00:33:09.980 --> 00:33:13.100]   I would say it's absolutely ecosystem lock in.
[00:33:13.100 --> 00:33:14.100]   Job one, two, three, four, five.
[00:33:14.100 --> 00:33:17.140]   But then Phil and Eddie, that's one of my favorite Steve Jobs stories where he said,
[00:33:17.140 --> 00:33:18.140]   "No, we're not going to support Windows."
[00:33:18.140 --> 00:33:19.140]   And they said, "Yes, we are Steve."
[00:33:19.140 --> 00:33:20.140]   Right.
[00:33:20.140 --> 00:33:21.140]   And he goes, "They're free out of it.
[00:33:21.140 --> 00:33:22.940]   You guys do it and if you fail it, your problem."
[00:33:22.940 --> 00:33:23.940]   Right.
[00:33:23.940 --> 00:33:24.940]   And they did it.
[00:33:24.940 --> 00:33:27.580]   So he wasn't afraid to be overruled by people who he thought had good opinions.
[00:33:27.580 --> 00:33:28.580]   Exactly.
[00:33:28.580 --> 00:33:29.580]   Exactly.
[00:33:29.580 --> 00:33:32.460]   I think nowadays, it's a little different.
[00:33:32.460 --> 00:33:36.820]   It used to be Apple existed as a second citizen in the ecosystem.
[00:33:36.820 --> 00:33:39.060]   So they had to work with Windows and everything else.
[00:33:39.060 --> 00:33:45.580]   I mean, that was, nowadays, I'm even falling into this Apple ecosystem lock in.
[00:33:45.580 --> 00:33:51.820]   It's just easier if you just give up and give up and give into Apple.
[00:33:51.820 --> 00:33:52.820]   It's just like selfishly.
[00:33:52.820 --> 00:33:59.460]   Like our forefathers in Boston and Lexington and Concord said, "You know what?
[00:33:59.460 --> 00:34:01.220]   Stamp back, shrimp back."
[00:34:01.220 --> 00:34:02.220]   You know?
[00:34:02.220 --> 00:34:06.220]   But I think it's selfishly for Apple.
[00:34:06.220 --> 00:34:09.940]   It's way easier to introduce this product and that people review it based on Apple music
[00:34:09.940 --> 00:34:14.180]   and AirPlay where they have, again, control over it than just to say, "Oh, this Spotify
[00:34:14.180 --> 00:34:17.220]   integration is kind of sucky and the Bluetooth kept fading out."
[00:34:17.220 --> 00:34:19.340]   And then that dominates sort of the review is this way.
[00:34:19.340 --> 00:34:20.700]   They can add those features later.
[00:34:20.700 --> 00:34:21.700]   People already have it.
[00:34:21.700 --> 00:34:24.580]   And you will, the new Spotify stuff is still a little right shaky.
[00:34:24.580 --> 00:34:25.580]   They have to fix that.
[00:34:25.580 --> 00:34:28.260]   But it doesn't dominate the discussion about the product.
[00:34:28.260 --> 00:34:30.020]   Employees of Apple, you're lucky.
[00:34:30.020 --> 00:34:32.940]   You're getting the HomePod for half price.
[00:34:32.940 --> 00:34:33.940]   Now I'm jealous.
[00:34:33.940 --> 00:34:34.940]   50% disk.
[00:34:34.940 --> 00:34:37.500]   Now I want to work for Apple.
[00:34:37.500 --> 00:34:39.860]   Nathan Olive Harris Giles, come on.
[00:34:39.860 --> 00:34:41.860]   Share that discount with us, huh?
[00:34:41.860 --> 00:34:42.860]   Huh?
[00:34:42.860 --> 00:34:43.860]   Huh?
[00:34:43.860 --> 00:34:45.420]   Mark Gurman.
[00:34:45.420 --> 00:34:46.580]   Good news for Apple employees.
[00:34:46.580 --> 00:34:48.460]   HomePod, 50% off for the next two months.
[00:34:48.460 --> 00:34:50.060]   They did this for the Apple Watch too.
[00:34:50.060 --> 00:34:51.740]   You know, it makes sense with the Apple Watch.
[00:34:51.740 --> 00:34:55.460]   You want your employees to be wearing the Apple Watch.
[00:34:55.460 --> 00:34:58.260]   Doing it for the HomePod is just nice.
[00:34:58.260 --> 00:34:59.260]   Yep.
[00:34:59.260 --> 00:35:01.060]   Makes me better ambassadors too.
[00:35:01.060 --> 00:35:04.100]   I think that they would have to wear the watch for a while.
[00:35:04.100 --> 00:35:08.940]   And to be someone who loves this product and starts their day by putting this on or using
[00:35:08.940 --> 00:35:12.460]   it, that will help them explain to customers why it's so great.
[00:35:12.460 --> 00:35:15.100]   I think the HomePod is the other thing, other thing like that.
[00:35:15.100 --> 00:35:18.780]   It's like, especially when people walk into an Apple store and they might, I think there
[00:35:18.780 --> 00:35:22.380]   were still a couple other Bluetooth speakers out there and say, well, what do I, you know,
[00:35:22.380 --> 00:35:26.620]   I got one that I got an anchor, a speaker and it works very, very well.
[00:35:26.620 --> 00:35:27.620]   Okay.
[00:35:27.620 --> 00:35:30.380]   This is the same thing as an oon speaker.
[00:35:30.380 --> 00:35:31.900]   As the name implies.
[00:35:31.900 --> 00:35:32.900]   Oon.
[00:35:32.900 --> 00:35:34.900]   So today we're going to take a break.
[00:35:34.900 --> 00:35:35.900]   We'll come back.
[00:35:35.900 --> 00:35:40.100]   We have the Apple earnings and we have Jason Snell's colorful graphs.
[00:35:40.100 --> 00:35:41.100]   I'm so glad Jason.
[00:35:41.100 --> 00:35:42.100]   Are they six colored?
[00:35:42.100 --> 00:35:47.500]   They were six colored, of course, from six colors.com or show today brought to you by
[00:35:47.500 --> 00:35:54.020]   the absolute first thing when I hit the home button on my iPad for almost always the first
[00:35:54.020 --> 00:35:56.380]   thing I launched texture.
[00:35:56.380 --> 00:35:58.220]   Texture is it's one of those.
[00:35:58.220 --> 00:35:59.220]   It's funny.
[00:35:59.220 --> 00:36:02.300]   You know, I think there's a go to app for everybody that you just when you when you turn
[00:36:02.300 --> 00:36:05.220]   on your phone, some people, it's maybe Facebook or Twitter.
[00:36:05.220 --> 00:36:09.260]   For me, it's texture because I love texture.
[00:36:09.260 --> 00:36:12.780]   I love the magazines texture is 200.
[00:36:12.780 --> 00:36:18.140]   The only app that offers unlimited access to over 200 premium magazines for an amazingly
[00:36:18.140 --> 00:36:25.220]   low monthly price that includes time Atlantic, the PC magazine, the New Yorker.
[00:36:25.220 --> 00:36:28.620]   What I really like about it, McLean's for you, Canadians.
[00:36:28.620 --> 00:36:32.100]   What I really like about it is it there's magazines like McLean's.
[00:36:32.100 --> 00:36:35.260]   I probably would never subscribe to and I certainly never see on the newsstand.
[00:36:35.260 --> 00:36:36.260]   What's a newsstand?
[00:36:36.260 --> 00:36:43.620]   I never see a newsstand anymore, but I love that it's there and I can and I can read it.
[00:36:43.620 --> 00:36:46.300]   Their curations fantastic stories just for you.
[00:36:46.300 --> 00:36:51.540]   These are stories that I don't know for some reason they're recommending the Oprah magazine
[00:36:51.540 --> 00:36:52.540]   article.
[00:36:52.540 --> 00:36:54.580]   What defines you for me?
[00:36:54.580 --> 00:36:55.420]   You know, what is that?
[00:36:55.420 --> 00:36:57.340]   Why is that?
[00:36:57.340 --> 00:37:00.260]   Is it your job, your hometown, your love of 70s soft rock?
[00:37:00.260 --> 00:37:02.300]   Oh, they know me so well.
[00:37:02.300 --> 00:37:06.900]   Now look, when you open it up, it's every page in the newsstand magazines, but I have to
[00:37:06.900 --> 00:37:11.700]   say it's much more beautiful than the magazine, the print version.
[00:37:11.700 --> 00:37:13.620]   You can zoom in on images.
[00:37:13.620 --> 00:37:18.980]   So if you love photography, National Geographic or our shutter bug, the ability to zoom in
[00:37:18.980 --> 00:37:23.620]   on an image and see every pixel so much better than the print version.
[00:37:23.620 --> 00:37:26.660]   Easier to read too because of course the text can also zoom.
[00:37:26.660 --> 00:37:29.100]   So it's big text if you want.
[00:37:29.100 --> 00:37:33.740]   You can turn the pages just like you can on a magazine, even the ads are there.
[00:37:33.740 --> 00:37:37.220]   I know some people will say, well, I don't want the ads, but that doesn't, you know,
[00:37:37.220 --> 00:37:38.740]   it's just it's easy to swipe by.
[00:37:38.740 --> 00:37:40.180]   But sometimes you read Vogue.
[00:37:40.180 --> 00:37:42.380]   I think half the magazine is about the ads, right?
[00:37:42.380 --> 00:37:45.860]   It's not just about the editorial.
[00:37:45.860 --> 00:37:47.500]   You can them all in here in texture.
[00:37:47.500 --> 00:37:49.140]   I am a big, big fan.
[00:37:49.140 --> 00:37:52.180]   Let's go back to the front page here.
[00:37:52.180 --> 00:37:56.540]   New and nerf worthy stories, daily news from writers and others.
[00:37:56.540 --> 00:37:58.900]   New Grant settles phone hacking claim against newspaper.
[00:37:58.900 --> 00:37:59.900]   Oh, interesting.
[00:37:59.900 --> 00:38:01.060]   I'll have to read that tomorrow.
[00:38:01.060 --> 00:38:06.540]   Kathy Griffin on our exile from Hollywood will Lady Bird make Academy Award history as
[00:38:06.540 --> 00:38:08.700]   we get closer to the Academy Awards.
[00:38:08.700 --> 00:38:15.020]   I find I'm reading more of the gossip magazines, entertainment, weekly and people magazine.
[00:38:15.020 --> 00:38:19.140]   The Dow, you following what happened last week on the stock market?
[00:38:19.140 --> 00:38:23.420]   Fortune, Reuters, money, McLean's, AARP, the magazine.
[00:38:23.420 --> 00:38:27.740]   You know, I'm actually, I don't subscribe to because I wouldn't want to admit to it, but
[00:38:27.740 --> 00:38:30.740]   I actually like the double AARP magazine.
[00:38:30.740 --> 00:38:31.740]   And so I can read it secretly.
[00:38:31.740 --> 00:38:37.420]   In fact, a lot of these magazines I'm reading in texture might be too embarrassed to subscribe
[00:38:37.420 --> 00:38:38.420]   to them.
[00:38:38.420 --> 00:38:40.860]   And I love it that I don't have the coffee table clutter.
[00:38:40.860 --> 00:38:45.580]   I don't have the guilt of subscribing to a magazine.
[00:38:45.580 --> 00:38:48.380]   Starbucks CEO Kevin Johnson on Finding Your Joy.
[00:38:48.380 --> 00:38:50.740]   This is straight from Fast Company.
[00:38:50.740 --> 00:38:51.740]   I love it.
[00:38:51.740 --> 00:38:52.900]   I favorite the magazines I want.
[00:38:52.900 --> 00:38:54.380]   They automatically are downloaded.
[00:38:54.380 --> 00:38:57.580]   So when I get on the airplane, those magazines are there.
[00:38:57.580 --> 00:38:58.860]   I can read them anytime.
[00:38:58.860 --> 00:39:03.460]   All the recent, most recent edition of Ad Week Consumer Reports dwell.
[00:39:03.460 --> 00:39:07.860]   Mother Jones, people, Rolling Stones, Severe, Shutterbug.
[00:39:07.860 --> 00:39:08.860]   These are just my magazines.
[00:39:08.860 --> 00:39:10.980]   The Hollywood Reporter, Atlantic, Sports Illustrated.
[00:39:10.980 --> 00:39:16.340]   Yes, we're talking about audio, sound and vision, the great audio magazine.
[00:39:16.340 --> 00:39:17.340]   It's there.
[00:39:17.340 --> 00:39:20.860]   And what I love is when you click the table of when you, by the way, this is another one
[00:39:20.860 --> 00:39:22.500]   where you want the ads, right?
[00:39:22.500 --> 00:39:26.820]   When you click the table of contents on sound and vision or any of these magazines, you
[00:39:26.820 --> 00:39:27.820]   go right to the article.
[00:39:27.820 --> 00:39:32.220]   See how much easier that is than reading an actual magazine?

[00:39:51.060 --> 00:39:54.780]   People said, Texture is one of the best apps of the year.
[00:39:54.780 --> 00:39:55.780]   You'll know why.
[00:39:55.780 --> 00:40:00.860]   It's the first app I go to every time I fire up my iPad or iPhone or Android device.
[00:40:00.860 --> 00:40:02.020]   Texture.com/Twit.

[00:40:08.740 --> 00:40:12.060]   Thank you, Texture, for bringing such great content.
[00:40:12.060 --> 00:40:16.460]   You know what I did recently is I deleted Twitter and Facebook and Instagram, all the
[00:40:16.460 --> 00:40:18.700]   social stuff from my phone.
[00:40:18.700 --> 00:40:22.380]   So which was kind of my normal habit of going to on the phone.
[00:40:22.380 --> 00:40:26.820]   Now I go to Texture to catch up on the news and stuff.
[00:40:26.820 --> 00:40:28.020]   My life is better.
[00:40:28.020 --> 00:40:29.020]   I'm happy.
[00:40:29.020 --> 00:40:31.020]   I'm not so grim.
[00:40:31.020 --> 00:40:32.020]   Boys life.
[00:40:32.020 --> 00:40:34.460]   Yes, Jay, they have boys life.
[00:40:34.460 --> 00:40:36.020]   What do you tell us?
[00:40:36.020 --> 00:40:37.380]   You can't get it up there?
[00:40:37.380 --> 00:40:38.740]   No, I can absolutely get it.
[00:40:38.740 --> 00:40:41.020]   I'm so jealous that you're able to delete all those social apps.
[00:40:41.020 --> 00:40:42.020]   Oh, yeah.
[00:40:42.020 --> 00:40:43.420]   I feel like I'm supposed to cover them.
[00:40:43.420 --> 00:40:45.900]   So I didn't cancel my accounts.
[00:40:45.900 --> 00:40:52.100]   I have it on my computer, but not waking up in the middle of the night and firing up
[00:40:52.100 --> 00:40:55.540]   Twitter, my stomach is much happier.
[00:40:55.540 --> 00:40:58.300]   Twitter just does-- Do you not find that?
[00:40:58.300 --> 00:41:00.580]   The Twitter just makes you angry sometimes.
[00:41:00.580 --> 00:41:01.580]   I stopped going to the timeline.
[00:41:01.580 --> 00:41:02.580]   I only listened.
[00:41:02.580 --> 00:41:03.580]   Look at my mentions now.
[00:41:03.580 --> 00:41:04.580]   Maybe that's the key.
[00:41:04.580 --> 00:41:05.580]   Yeah.
[00:41:05.580 --> 00:41:06.580]   Yeah.
[00:41:06.580 --> 00:41:07.580]   It just makes me angry.
[00:41:07.580 --> 00:41:12.220]   Facebook is a little better now with their new-- your friends and family feed.
[00:41:12.220 --> 00:41:13.220]   But I just--
[00:41:13.220 --> 00:41:19.380]   I just-- well, just if you just mute or delete anybody who's--
[00:41:19.380 --> 00:41:20.380]   Maybe I should do that.
[00:41:20.380 --> 00:41:21.380]   --put some timeline that you don't like.
[00:41:21.380 --> 00:41:23.380]   Yeah, I feel bad about that.
[00:41:23.380 --> 00:41:24.380]   I'm so Canadian, I feel bad about that.
[00:41:24.380 --> 00:41:30.980]   You know, I just found out, as I found out from Reddit, there is a law in British Columbia
[00:41:30.980 --> 00:41:35.700]   that just because you apologize to somebody for crashing into their car or stepping on
[00:41:35.700 --> 00:41:40.260]   their toes or breaking their arm is not an admission of guilt.
[00:41:40.260 --> 00:41:42.900]   You can't be held responsible just because you apologize.
[00:41:42.900 --> 00:41:44.720]   Because Canadians, it's reflexive.
[00:41:44.720 --> 00:41:45.580]   Sorry.
[00:41:45.580 --> 00:41:46.460]   Yeah. Sorry.
[00:41:46.460 --> 00:41:46.980]   Oh, I'm sorry.
[00:41:46.980 --> 00:41:47.980]   Sorry.
[00:41:47.980 --> 00:41:50.660]   That does not count as admission of guilt in Canada, at least in
[00:41:50.660 --> 00:41:51.420]   British Columbia.
[00:41:51.420 --> 00:41:52.380]   All right.
[00:41:52.380 --> 00:41:54.660]   kudos to Jason Snell.
[00:41:54.660 --> 00:41:59.540]   He had this out that day of Thursday.
[00:41:59.540 --> 00:42:00.540]   The earnings came out.
[00:42:00.540 --> 00:42:05.380]   Uh, bottom line record revenue record profits once again.
[00:42:05.380 --> 00:42:07.560]   Yep, but also not.
[00:42:07.560 --> 00:42:12.860]   Perfect rainbow shaped in the world of Apple iPhone.
[00:42:12.940 --> 00:42:20.180]   Sales down 1% year over year, max sales down quarter over quarter.
[00:42:20.180 --> 00:42:23.780]   We don't know about those iPhone numbers because the people who did the math for
[00:42:23.780 --> 00:42:28.620]   the 13, I forget that I'm a 13 versus 14 weeks, I think said it was slightly up.
[00:42:28.620 --> 00:42:32.420]   If you account for the time, different slightly up, they sold, they sold more
[00:42:32.420 --> 00:42:34.860]   units per second or something given the amount of seconds.
[00:42:34.860 --> 00:42:38.020]   Well, one thing we know for sure revenue on iPhone is way up.
[00:42:38.020 --> 00:42:42.020]   Hey, yeah, which is what we were talking about in terms of iPhone 10 mix.
[00:42:42.020 --> 00:42:42.420]   Yeah.
[00:42:42.420 --> 00:42:46.340]   Uh, did somebody do the ASP calculations to figure that out yet?
[00:42:46.340 --> 00:42:47.900]   I'm just, I don't know if they did or not.
[00:42:47.900 --> 00:42:50.500]   Haven't seen it, but they just knew that it was skewing towards the higher
[00:42:50.500 --> 00:42:52.940]   priced iPhone eight plus and my phone 10 models.
[00:42:52.940 --> 00:42:55.100]   So this is the quarterly sales.
[00:42:55.100 --> 00:42:57.620]   Thanks to Jason going back to 2012.
[00:42:57.620 --> 00:43:03.860]   And as you can see, I mean, the last few Q fours have been pretty darn good.
[00:43:03.860 --> 00:43:09.740]   Well beyond anything, uh, in 2012, 13 or 14, the running out of humans to sell
[00:43:09.740 --> 00:43:12.260]   them to, they're going to have to hope you'll on fines, marshals, increase the
[00:43:12.300 --> 00:43:13.300]   price of the iPhone.
[00:43:13.300 --> 00:43:21.060]   I can't even though, Q Q Q one 2017, they sold 78.2 million iPhones Q one 2018.
[00:43:21.060 --> 00:43:24.260]   They sold 77.3 million iPhones.
[00:43:24.260 --> 00:43:28.900]   I can't say that that's a flop in any result, right?
[00:43:28.900 --> 00:43:29.820]   A little down.
[00:43:29.820 --> 00:43:33.180]   Also, also these aren't app.
[00:43:33.180 --> 00:43:35.620]   These weren't apples targets that they fail to hit.
[00:43:35.620 --> 00:43:36.980]   These are our targets.
[00:43:36.980 --> 00:43:38.860]   So we don't care what analysts say.
[00:43:39.740 --> 00:43:46.340]   Uh, four quarter moving average iPhone units, uh, 53.9 million.
[00:43:46.340 --> 00:43:49.180]   That show a huge flaw in the system because Wall Street is really designed
[00:43:49.180 --> 00:43:50.140]   to promote growth.
[00:43:50.140 --> 00:43:52.220]   And once you have everything, where do you grow?
[00:43:52.220 --> 00:43:53.140]   You can't grow farther.
[00:43:53.140 --> 00:43:57.860]   Well, but, uh, you know, I think nobody would question that Apple's a good
[00:43:57.860 --> 00:44:01.820]   stock by given that they, uh, now are repatriating their American, their
[00:44:01.820 --> 00:44:03.340]   international money into America.
[00:44:03.340 --> 00:44:06.180]   And they're going to give most of that money back to stockholders through
[00:44:06.180 --> 00:44:07.500]   stock by Beck's dividends.
[00:44:07.820 --> 00:44:10.620]   Nobody's going to be a sad shareholder.
[00:44:10.620 --> 00:44:13.060]   Scooter X, who is our chat mod.
[00:44:13.060 --> 00:44:14.180]   Is it okay if I tell this story?
[00:44:14.180 --> 00:44:14.860]   Scooter X.
[00:44:14.860 --> 00:44:15.980]   I don't know.
[00:44:15.980 --> 00:44:19.420]   He, uh, he is a shareholder and he is going.
[00:44:19.420 --> 00:44:20.380]   Uh, what is it?
[00:44:20.380 --> 00:44:25.460]   February 18th, he's going to the, uh, shareholders meeting at the new Apple, um,
[00:44:25.460 --> 00:44:26.460]   campus.
[00:44:26.460 --> 00:44:29.140]   So a few lucky shareholders won the lottery.
[00:44:29.140 --> 00:44:32.340]   He said he didn't get in the lottery and he was upset.
[00:44:32.340 --> 00:44:33.260]   He didn't get in.
[00:44:33.260 --> 00:44:35.500]   And then, uh, what did you complain about it?
[00:44:35.500 --> 00:44:36.300]   Did you tweet about it?
[00:44:36.300 --> 00:44:37.580]   Scooter X, something happened.
[00:44:37.820 --> 00:44:40.300]   And somebody from Apple called and said, Hey, we found an extra ticket.
[00:44:40.300 --> 00:44:40.820]   You want to go?
[00:44:40.820 --> 00:44:43.100]   So he's going.
[00:44:43.100 --> 00:44:43.980]   Nice.
[00:44:43.980 --> 00:44:44.700]   Nice Apple.
[00:44:44.700 --> 00:44:46.940]   They must know that you, uh, you're our chat mod.
[00:44:46.940 --> 00:44:47.860]   I think that's probably it.
[00:44:47.860 --> 00:44:51.340]   They must be really confident about their stock performance.
[00:44:51.340 --> 00:44:55.860]   If they're actually inviting cranky stockholders to the big part of the meeting, uh,
[00:44:55.860 --> 00:45:00.420]   year over year iPhone revenue change up 13% very, very good.
[00:45:00.420 --> 00:45:04.060]   Although again, you know, I mean, that doesn't mean they sold more iPhones,
[00:45:04.060 --> 00:45:05.500]   just that they're making more money.
[00:45:05.740 --> 00:45:07.580]   iPad sales, here's a bright spot.
[00:45:07.580 --> 00:45:09.220]   Look at the jump and iPad sales.
[00:45:09.220 --> 00:45:14.620]   Uh, it's year over year quarter to quarter, even going back.
[00:45:14.620 --> 00:45:18.100]   You'd have to go back to 2016 to show us better sales.
[00:45:18.100 --> 00:45:23.020]   And I'd have to credit that to the iPad pro and maybe the $329 low priced iPad.
[00:45:23.020 --> 00:45:23.380]   I don't know.
[00:45:23.380 --> 00:45:25.940]   And also the sub, you know, we're starting to finally age out.
[00:45:25.940 --> 00:45:29.700]   Like people holding on to iPad news for years and years and a lot of them
[00:45:29.700 --> 00:45:31.660]   finally updated with that new nine point seven inch.
[00:45:31.660 --> 00:45:34.540]   I was hoping for better, uh, max sales.
[00:45:34.540 --> 00:45:36.740]   Cause I, you know, I'm just, I'm just prejudiced.
[00:45:36.740 --> 00:45:40.140]   I want the Mac to be a big part of their overall revenue.
[00:45:40.140 --> 00:45:41.140]   It's not close.
[00:45:41.140 --> 00:45:43.300]   Quarterly max sales down.
[00:45:43.300 --> 00:45:49.140]   Um, uh, it's actually the worst quarter leave, a worst Q one sales.
[00:45:49.140 --> 00:45:51.260]   Uh, they've had since 2014.
[00:45:51.260 --> 00:45:54.620]   Uh, maybe that's because people hate those touch pads.
[00:45:54.620 --> 00:45:57.860]   I can only also had no, they also had no new max in the last quarter.
[00:45:57.860 --> 00:45:59.820]   Traditionally, they've had like a new iMac or something.
[00:45:59.820 --> 00:46:01.660]   Oh, the iMac pro came out in this quarter, didn't it?
[00:46:01.660 --> 00:46:02.100]   Yeah.
[00:46:02.100 --> 00:46:02.220]   Yeah.
[00:46:02.220 --> 00:46:05.060]   I'm a pro did, but that's a very small part of sales and new iMacs and new
[00:46:05.060 --> 00:46:06.660]   Mac book pros, which are most of their sales.
[00:46:06.660 --> 00:46:07.780]   All that came out in June.
[00:46:07.780 --> 00:46:08.140]   Right.
[00:46:08.140 --> 00:46:14.900]   Here's the pie chart showing revenue by category 70% Wow iPhone.
[00:46:14.900 --> 00:46:22.900]   Seven percent iPad, 8% Mac services continuously going up.
[00:46:22.900 --> 00:46:26.700]   It's now 10% probably most of that driven by app store, right?
[00:46:26.700 --> 00:46:29.220]   Not Apple music, not iCloud app store.
[00:46:29.220 --> 00:46:29.580]   Right.
[00:46:31.180 --> 00:46:37.980]   Other means what the Apple TV, AirPods, AirPods, all that stuff is beats in this.
[00:46:37.980 --> 00:46:41.940]   Um, these heads are probably it.
[00:46:41.940 --> 00:46:42.460]   Yeah.
[00:46:42.460 --> 00:46:42.860]   Yeah.
[00:46:42.860 --> 00:46:43.260]   Yeah.
[00:46:43.260 --> 00:46:44.420]   I think they're another other.
[00:46:44.420 --> 00:46:48.980]   So others, not a big category compared to the rest, but I mean, most
[00:46:48.980 --> 00:46:51.340]   companies would still give three of their executives over and down.
[00:46:51.340 --> 00:46:52.060]   Yeah.
[00:46:52.060 --> 00:46:57.260]   I mean, we should point out when we're talking total, total revenue, uh, for a
[00:46:57.260 --> 00:46:58.380]   three month period.
[00:46:58.940 --> 00:47:04.300]   We should emphasize for three months was what 80, what was 80 billion dollars?
[00:47:04.300 --> 00:47:05.820]   80 is all I think.
[00:47:05.820 --> 00:47:06.140]   Yeah.
[00:47:06.140 --> 00:47:11.460]   And the, and the quarterly profit, like the money they get to keep for three
[00:47:11.460 --> 00:47:15.220]   months, 20 billion dollars for three months.
[00:47:15.220 --> 00:47:19.700]   So, yeah, you know, everybody's jumping up and down because Amazon made a billion
[00:47:19.700 --> 00:47:22.220]   bucks is like, you can basically hear Luke.
[00:47:22.220 --> 00:47:24.860]   We cannot, we cannot print it fast enough.
[00:47:25.620 --> 00:47:28.220]   We try to make so much money, we have no where to put it.
[00:47:28.220 --> 00:47:29.340]   It's kind of amazing.
[00:47:29.340 --> 00:47:29.820]   Yeah.
[00:47:29.820 --> 00:47:30.340]   It's amazing.
[00:47:30.340 --> 00:47:31.060]   Kind of amazing.
[00:47:31.060 --> 00:47:35.820]   Total lap and revenue is a, uh, 59.8 million dollars in this four quarter
[00:47:35.820 --> 00:47:43.900]   moving average, uh, bet record breaking, record breaking, all, all always in every
[00:47:43.900 --> 00:47:50.220]   way, um, but still every single chart, every single bar, it's iPhone, iPhone,
[00:47:50.220 --> 00:47:53.180]   iPhone, iPhone, iPhone, you think that's worrying?
[00:47:53.180 --> 00:47:55.020]   Uh, not really.
[00:47:55.020 --> 00:47:56.100]   I mean, it would be tail.
[00:47:56.100 --> 00:48:00.820]   I think it would be really worrying in almost any other company with Apple,
[00:48:00.820 --> 00:48:05.860]   people who once they get someone into an iPhone, they stay got either because
[00:48:05.860 --> 00:48:10.620]   they're absolutely delighted by whatever the next one is, or Apple just,
[00:48:10.620 --> 00:48:15.820]   some of some of our, some of the new iPhones are more that are better received
[00:48:15.820 --> 00:48:20.020]   than the others, but they've never had one that got people so steamed that they
[00:48:20.020 --> 00:48:22.220]   started looking elsewhere at the Verizon store.
[00:48:22.580 --> 00:48:28.860]   So, so I, I would like, I would like to see them start creating really bigger
[00:48:28.860 --> 00:48:31.860]   pieces of the other pie, but that could be just prejudicial.
[00:48:31.860 --> 00:48:35.140]   If they, if you took away the iPhone and just simply said, here's, here is a
[00:48:35.140 --> 00:48:38.500]   company that does everything, but the iPhone, Apple would still be doing very,
[00:48:38.500 --> 00:48:38.940]   very well.
[00:48:38.940 --> 00:48:41.260]   So plus I think you nailed it.
[00:48:41.260 --> 00:48:47.860]   Uh, it's, it is the flagship, but there are a lot of other products and it
[00:48:47.860 --> 00:48:49.220]   brings you into the fold.
[00:48:49.220 --> 00:48:50.660]   It's also an outlier.
[00:48:50.660 --> 00:48:51.660]   I don't think there's ever been, like,
[00:48:51.660 --> 00:48:54.660]   including never, you could have an optly control over fossil fuel, or she says,
[00:48:54.660 --> 00:48:55.860]   never been a product like it.
[00:48:55.860 --> 00:48:58.340]   It's just a complete outlier and you better off ignoring it.
[00:48:58.340 --> 00:49:01.060]   Like it's great that we have it, but you're better off looking at Apple without that.
[00:49:01.060 --> 00:49:07.420]   Ben Thompson, uh, Stratecary says Apple has entered middle age.
[00:49:07.420 --> 00:49:12.180]   I mean, is it really fun to make, is it really okay to make fun of the rings
[00:49:12.180 --> 00:49:12.740]   hairline?
[00:49:12.740 --> 00:49:21.620]   Actually, uh, Ben admits that he also, he also in his, in, in his middle age, uh,
[00:49:21.620 --> 00:49:27.580]   isn't this funny, this wired cover from June 1997 with the multi color,
[00:49:27.580 --> 00:49:32.140]   the rainbow color to Apple and the covered in barbed wire and the word pray.
[00:49:32.140 --> 00:49:35.740]   But he said, well, your pray, your prayers were heard, obviously.
[00:49:35.740 --> 00:49:38.300]   Apple's doing just fine.
[00:49:38.300 --> 00:49:39.540]   It's 20 years.
[00:49:39.540 --> 00:49:40.540]   Yeah.
[00:49:40.540 --> 00:49:45.140]   Um, and I, he's talking about the homepot strategy here.
[00:49:45.140 --> 00:49:48.860]   He says the strategy around the homepot, at least from my perspective, far more
[00:49:48.860 --> 00:49:51.060]   fascinating than the device itself.
[00:49:51.060 --> 00:49:57.700]   He has one apparently says, Oh no, I guess he's talking about his echo dot to get a, uh, but he says, um,
[00:49:57.700 --> 00:50:03.980]   my favorite music of Apple music when it launched, it was not a statement
[00:50:03.980 --> 00:50:06.460]   whether or not the service would be successful, whether or not it was worth the
[00:50:06.460 --> 00:50:06.980]   trouble.
[00:50:06.980 --> 00:50:09.460]   Well, now homepot is the answer.
[00:50:09.460 --> 00:50:14.060]   He says, I have to admit, I'm pretty impressed with Apple's foresight.
[00:50:14.060 --> 00:50:14.460]   Go ahead.
[00:50:14.460 --> 00:50:17.180]   You can capsulate encapsulated, uh, Renee.
[00:50:17.300 --> 00:50:20.020]   Well, no, I just think he was, he was referencing a Wall Street Journal article,
[00:50:20.020 --> 00:50:23.260]   which is based on analyst reports and you can always take those with a huge
[00:50:23.260 --> 00:50:27.700]   grain of salt, but that Apple music is, uh, is on track to surpass Spotify in the US
[00:50:27.700 --> 00:50:28.180]   market.
[00:50:28.180 --> 00:50:29.180]   Do you think that's true?
[00:50:29.180 --> 00:50:30.260]   Relatively soon.
[00:50:30.260 --> 00:50:32.940]   I mean, the US market is, is, is relatively unique.
[00:50:32.940 --> 00:50:35.100]   Um, and Apple has a huge deal.
[00:50:35.100 --> 00:50:39.220]   It's, it's whenever you criticize something about a vendor, they always have
[00:50:39.220 --> 00:50:43.340]   service zero, like Siri is bad, but because it's the built in one, every time
[00:50:43.340 --> 00:50:45.740]   someone opens an iPhone, Apple has a chance to make it better.
[00:50:45.940 --> 00:50:49.060]   Every time they use any time they launch an iPhone, they have a chance to get
[00:50:49.060 --> 00:50:50.340]   another Apple music subscriber.
[00:50:50.340 --> 00:50:53.460]   So the benefits of being a platform, you know, that's why Google and Apple and
[00:50:53.460 --> 00:50:54.660]   other companies are in this business.
[00:50:54.660 --> 00:50:59.220]   It just gives you such a huge leg up in terms of, of if you can make a good
[00:50:59.220 --> 00:51:01.340]   service of getting people to use that service.
[00:51:01.340 --> 00:51:01.700]   Yeah.
[00:51:01.700 --> 00:51:05.620]   And so that's why it's significant that if they, if they were to surpass Spotify
[00:51:05.620 --> 00:51:10.260]   in the United States, guess what the guess, what the guess where Apple has the
[00:51:10.260 --> 00:51:12.140]   biggest percentage of phone users.
[00:51:12.580 --> 00:51:16.420]   It's, it's, it's going to be more interesting in the coming years when
[00:51:16.420 --> 00:51:20.340]   everybody, they've already sold Apple music subscriptions to all the iPhone
[00:51:20.340 --> 00:51:23.900]   users, but now there are people in other countries as well that they have to go
[00:51:23.900 --> 00:51:28.100]   get Spotify still has about twice the subscriber base as Apple music.
[00:51:28.100 --> 00:51:31.820]   Uh, it's definitely worth considering that Apple music has been around for
[00:51:31.820 --> 00:51:38.100]   quite not quite so long at time as Spotify, but I think it's, it's also worth
[00:51:38.100 --> 00:51:43.140]   saying that Apple music is also available on Android, but we got to make, I've
[00:51:43.140 --> 00:51:46.900]   interested to see the numbers on how many Android people already have switched to
[00:51:46.900 --> 00:51:47.580]   Apple music.
[00:51:47.580 --> 00:51:50.660]   That's the one where there's no built in advantage.
[00:51:50.660 --> 00:51:55.460]   There's, by fact, trying to overcome the lesser it, Google music has an advantage
[00:51:55.460 --> 00:51:59.300]   on Android, but it's not necessarily built in every phone.
[00:51:59.300 --> 00:52:00.660]   It's something they still have to go and get.
[00:52:00.660 --> 00:52:03.220]   It works best with Android, but not the others.
[00:52:03.220 --> 00:52:05.540]   So there's, there's a lot to really digest in that number.
[00:52:06.100 --> 00:52:09.460]   My understanding is that Apple music on Android is like, if you have five kids
[00:52:09.460 --> 00:52:12.500]   and one of them happens to have an Android phone, it's nice that your family plan
[00:52:12.500 --> 00:52:13.620]   works for them too.
[00:52:13.620 --> 00:52:15.820]   And it's sort of like the same thing with iMessage on Android.
[00:52:15.820 --> 00:52:18.980]   It's like, at a certain point, it's valuable for Apple's platform to have
[00:52:18.980 --> 00:52:22.580]   iMessage and to have Apple music, because it's a way of making more value for the
[00:52:22.580 --> 00:52:24.060]   phone, which is 70% of their income.
[00:52:24.060 --> 00:52:27.660]   But if those things ever become more valuable, like BBM arguably became more
[00:52:27.660 --> 00:52:31.100]   valuable as a platform than Blackberry was, and they didn't do anything about it.
[00:52:31.100 --> 00:52:32.500]   And that's where you start to hit the risk.
[00:52:33.980 --> 00:52:37.020]   And I don't think Apple is really caring whether they beat Spotify.
[00:52:37.020 --> 00:52:39.900]   I think that this it's the ecosystem.
[00:52:39.900 --> 00:52:41.740]   It's the, it's the reality.
[00:52:41.740 --> 00:52:43.500]   The best product for their customers.
[00:52:43.500 --> 00:52:43.900]   Yeah.
[00:52:43.900 --> 00:52:44.300]   Yeah.
[00:52:44.300 --> 00:52:47.620]   In fact, Ben says, you know, people misunderstand it.
[00:52:47.620 --> 00:52:52.420]   They, they say customer, most commentary is assumed customer one, customer wants
[00:52:52.420 --> 00:52:55.300]   HomePod to therefore customer subscribes to Apple music.
[00:52:55.300 --> 00:52:56.300]   Three Apple profits.
[00:52:56.300 --> 00:53:00.980]   He says, no, the order is customer owns an iPhone, which is a great place to start
[00:53:00.980 --> 00:53:03.220]   because you have more of those than anything else.
[00:53:03.220 --> 00:53:06.980]   Customer subscribes to Apple music because it's installed by default on their iPhone.
[00:53:06.980 --> 00:53:08.260]   It just works better.
[00:53:08.260 --> 00:53:12.540]   And three, as an Apple music subscriber, customer only has one choice and smart
[00:53:12.540 --> 00:53:15.300]   speakers HomePod then profit.
[00:53:15.300 --> 00:53:16.900]   But I think it's even bigger than that.
[00:53:16.900 --> 00:53:21.740]   I mean, I think really this the ecosystem as a whole, this is it's more and more.
[00:53:21.740 --> 00:53:24.340]   It's clear the ecosystem play is working.
[00:53:24.340 --> 00:53:27.820]   And also as we talked about, Apple is running out of people to sell iPhones to.
[00:53:27.820 --> 00:53:30.780]   And if you can't sell more things, you've got to make the amount of money that you
[00:53:30.780 --> 00:53:32.180]   sell each thing for a greater.
[00:53:32.180 --> 00:53:34.060]   And you can do that by increasing iPhone prices.
[00:53:34.060 --> 00:53:37.980]   But you can also do that by selling people Apple music subscriptions and Apple TVs
[00:53:37.980 --> 00:53:39.380]   and HomePods to go along with it.
[00:53:39.380 --> 00:53:42.940]   That way, it's going to get more customers, you extract more money from each customer.
[00:53:42.940 --> 00:53:44.340]   One of the few ways you.
[00:53:44.340 --> 00:53:49.300]   That's part of what disappoints me about Apple's overall way of doing business.
[00:53:49.300 --> 00:53:52.580]   I do think that they make choices based on what will create the best
[00:53:52.580 --> 00:53:53.860]   experience for the consumer.
[00:53:53.860 --> 00:53:59.900]   But I also think that just as sunk into into bedrock is the idea of the best, the best
[00:53:59.940 --> 00:54:04.260]   world for the users is for the user to only buy Apple products that we're going to, we're
[00:54:04.260 --> 00:54:06.420]   not going to build the best music service.
[00:54:06.420 --> 00:54:09.900]   We're going to build the best music service that works with everything else that where
[00:54:09.900 --> 00:54:11.580]   we can control the end-to-end experience.
[00:54:11.580 --> 00:54:15.660]   The Apple music app on Android is one of the most beautiful apps I have on my Android
[00:54:15.660 --> 00:54:15.980]   phone.
[00:54:15.980 --> 00:54:21.340]   So it shows that they can definitely translate an Apple aesthetic to another platform very, very well.
[00:54:21.340 --> 00:54:25.980]   So that's why it kind of bothers me if they decide to step out of the batter's box, whenever
[00:54:25.980 --> 00:54:30.540]   they have an ability to prove that we're not just, we're not just good at making things,
[00:54:30.540 --> 00:54:31.860]   we can control the whole world.
[00:54:31.860 --> 00:54:36.820]   We're okay to continue on our space exploration theme.
[00:54:36.820 --> 00:54:44.060]   We can build a Mars rover that just goes out there and deals with whatever it encounters as opposed to
[00:54:44.060 --> 00:54:46.180]   we've got a Mars rover that works great.
[00:54:46.180 --> 00:54:53.020]   So long as you operate it in the mall of America and they never add any stores or turn off any of the water features.
[00:54:53.300 --> 00:54:56.020]   But ultimately, I can't imagine Android is that important to Apple.
[00:54:56.020 --> 00:55:02.020]   If anything, what that app does is tell us people, hey, you know, it's nice over here in the Apple world.
[00:55:02.020 --> 00:55:02.860]   Come on over.
[00:55:02.860 --> 00:55:08.540]   You see, this is a little taste, but if you really want the full experience, I mean, maybe it's smart.
[00:55:08.540 --> 00:55:17.020]   It's way more annoying with iMessage because it really does having, having messages locked into iOS and
[00:55:17.020 --> 00:55:22.380]   macOS really denies the fact that this is a service that connects people, it connects you to your
[00:55:22.380 --> 00:55:23.980]   friends, it connects you to your relatives.
[00:55:23.980 --> 00:55:30.420]   If you look at the larger plan that Apple's pursuing, it connects you to the larger world of restaurants and
[00:55:30.420 --> 00:55:32.380]   navigation and payments and everything.
[00:55:32.380 --> 00:55:38.420]   And for them to say that it's not important to us that we connect all users to everybody that they might want to
[00:55:38.420 --> 00:55:43.020]   connect with, we are only interested in connecting them to other people who are making money for Apple.
[00:55:43.020 --> 00:55:45.540]   That's not a sign of a great company.
[00:55:45.540 --> 00:55:52.140]   I'm not saying that Apple's not a great company, but that's a box on the checklist that is left unchecked for Apple.
[00:55:52.700 --> 00:55:56.700]   I just think they don't know how, like it's just not a business that they are either in or understand.
[00:55:56.700 --> 00:56:01.660]   Like if you buy an iPhone, that pays for iMessage, but if you're using iMessage on Android, what pays for that?
[00:56:01.660 --> 00:56:07.900]   They're used to not running anything at a loss and supporting, let's say an additional 500 million users is a
[00:56:07.900 --> 00:56:11.060]   significant infrastructure and expense and development cost.
[00:56:11.060 --> 00:56:13.500]   And what would they do to monetize that?
[00:56:13.500 --> 00:56:16.820]   They're not going to run ads in between it, like Instagram or something would.
[00:56:17.340 --> 00:56:22.060]   And Apple pays and really needs that secure element. They don't have that on most Android.
[00:56:22.060 --> 00:56:25.820]   It would be such a fundamental shift in how Apple runs its business.
[00:56:25.820 --> 00:56:28.860]   I understand why they haven't left Apple more into it.
[00:56:28.860 --> 00:56:32.620]   Let me finish with Ben's thought because he says Apple's in middle age.
[00:56:32.620 --> 00:56:35.500]   And he says that's not necessarily a negative.
[00:56:35.500 --> 00:56:39.500]   In short, it just doesn't make much sense to act like a young person with nothing to lose.
[00:56:39.500 --> 00:56:43.180]   One gets older, one circumstances and priorities change, one settles down.
[00:56:43.180 --> 00:56:44.060]   It's all inevitable.
[00:56:44.060 --> 00:56:47.340]   Keep in mind, I actually really love these last three paragraphs.
[00:56:47.340 --> 00:56:48.700]   I'm going to read them if you don't mind.
[00:56:48.700 --> 00:56:52.700]   The Swashbuckling Apple, the one led by Steve Jobs, not Tim Cook,
[00:56:52.700 --> 00:56:55.180]   that looms so large in everyone's imaginations,
[00:56:55.180 --> 00:56:57.740]   couldn't have had more different circumstances.
[00:56:57.740 --> 00:57:01.180]   Jobs is a product and execution genius.
[00:57:01.180 --> 00:57:05.980]   But in truth, we have no idea how he would have dealt with the strategy questions facing Cook.
[00:57:05.980 --> 00:57:11.260]   So, and he brings up this iTunes for Windows as you did.
[00:57:11.260 --> 00:57:15.980]   It was correct strategically as making HomePod exclusive to iOS devices.
[00:57:15.980 --> 00:57:19.980]   The former one, former Fitz1's mental model of how a company should operate
[00:57:19.980 --> 00:57:22.540]   is a matter of circumstance, not principles.
[00:57:22.540 --> 00:57:24.380]   So, it was for every jobs decision.
[00:57:24.380 --> 00:57:28.380]   Expanding the iPod market with the mini wasn't disrupting itself.
[00:57:28.380 --> 00:57:29.980]   It was a means of making more money.
[00:57:29.980 --> 00:57:34.940]   And an even stalker example is that the iPhone cannibalizing oneself is a whole lot
[00:57:34.940 --> 00:57:37.500]   less impressive when the cannibalizing,
[00:57:38.460 --> 00:57:42.540]   actually, maybe you should say more impressive when the cannibalizing product is a higher ASP
[00:57:42.540 --> 00:57:44.140]   and higher margins.
[00:57:44.140 --> 00:57:45.900]   This is to take nothing away from either decision.
[00:57:45.900 --> 00:57:50.780]   Simply note, it's a lot easier to make decisions everyone loves when the overall market is growing.
[00:57:50.780 --> 00:57:53.820]   The fact of the matter is, Segan?
[00:57:53.820 --> 00:57:57.820]   I think he's saying that because they thought they would make more money on the iPhone,
[00:57:57.820 --> 00:57:59.740]   it was easy to sort of cannibalize the iPod.
[00:57:59.740 --> 00:58:01.500]   But I think there's still inherent risk in that.
[00:58:01.500 --> 00:58:02.300]   Oh, I see.
[00:58:02.300 --> 00:58:04.220]   A lot of companies are too afraid to make those choices.
[00:58:04.220 --> 00:58:06.700]   He's saying it's not as courageous as it seems.
[00:58:07.900 --> 00:58:12.380]   But when you look at Microsoft and you see how afraid they were of cannibalizing windows,
[00:58:12.380 --> 00:58:13.740]   with things like career or something.
[00:58:13.740 --> 00:58:14.700]   It's courageous.
[00:58:14.700 --> 00:58:15.740]   I think it's courageous.
[00:58:15.740 --> 00:58:17.740]   I mean, they didn't know it would have a higher margins.
[00:58:17.740 --> 00:58:20.780]   I mean, they knew it would have a higher margin, but they know it would sell better.
[00:58:20.780 --> 00:58:21.020]   Yeah.
[00:58:21.020 --> 00:58:23.180]   So, I think it's courageous.
[00:58:23.180 --> 00:58:26.780]   It's anytime you say, "I'm going to make the next thing and it's going to cannibalize the old thing."
[00:58:26.780 --> 00:58:29.500]   That's a big deal for any company.
[00:58:29.500 --> 00:58:30.300]   That's a big jump.
[00:58:30.300 --> 00:58:36.460]   It's always, however, important to recognize the difference between Apple and all other companies.
[00:58:36.460 --> 00:58:40.140]   Microsoft has a problem, a huge problem that Apple doesn't have.
[00:58:40.140 --> 00:58:44.700]   Where people can go anywhere to buy the hardware that runs Microsoft software.
[00:58:44.700 --> 00:58:49.020]   Apple, they know that if they want to make it, they can bravely make a huge change to their
[00:58:49.020 --> 00:58:56.540]   Mac operating system knowing that it's not as though the makers of Macintosh's that run older versions
[00:58:56.540 --> 00:58:59.980]   of the operating system can still run that stuff.
[00:58:59.980 --> 00:59:01.500]   They can still sell that hardware.
[00:59:01.500 --> 00:59:04.700]   No, because people are just like you can't really buy a power PC.
[00:59:04.700 --> 00:59:12.300]   You can have a power PC or a 68030 based Mac if you want, but you're going to be stuck in 1996,
[00:59:12.300 --> 00:59:15.740]   1997, and you won't be able to use Mac OS X.
[00:59:15.740 --> 00:59:20.460]   So, there's so many interesting conversations to have about the way that these companies do business.
[00:59:20.460 --> 00:59:23.500]   They were very concerned about cannibalizing sales.
[00:59:23.500 --> 00:59:28.540]   And I think a bigger issue is just simple lack of imagination, lack of vision.
[00:59:28.540 --> 00:59:32.540]   But a lot of it is that if they decide to do something that is so radically different
[00:59:33.580 --> 00:59:37.260]   to all of these customers that are just want to sit down at a computer,
[00:59:37.260 --> 00:59:41.100]   sit down at it, just turn on a computer and do boring stuff that makes the money.
[00:59:41.100 --> 00:59:46.860]   It's not as though all these makers of PCs, not as Odell and HP and everybody else is necessarily
[00:59:46.860 --> 00:59:49.260]   going to follow Microsoft into the future.
[00:59:49.260 --> 00:59:52.860]   They're going to be perfectly happy to say, "Oh, guess what? This still works great with
[00:59:52.860 --> 00:59:55.980]   with a 2007 version of Windows that you know and love."
[00:59:55.980 --> 00:59:58.140]   So, there's a lot of variables to coordinate here.
[00:59:58.140 --> 01:00:01.660]   Last paragraph of the article, and I think this is absolutely right on.
[01:00:01.660 --> 01:00:05.900]   The fact of the matter is Apple Undercook is a strategically sound
[01:00:05.900 --> 01:00:09.020]   accompanied as there is. It makes sense to settle down.
[01:00:09.020 --> 01:00:15.500]   What that means for the long run, stability-driven growth or stagnation remains to be seen.
[01:00:15.500 --> 01:00:17.660]   I think that's what I've been saying all along.
[01:00:17.660 --> 01:00:23.980]   I think the knock there is that Apple Undercook, for example, is super eager to embrace AR.
[01:00:23.980 --> 01:00:27.100]   And they're embracing AI in some ways, but other people would argue that they're not going
[01:00:27.100 --> 01:00:31.020]   all in on things like Siri, the way that a company like Amazon is going in,
[01:00:31.020 --> 01:00:34.620]   on Alexa. And you always have to pick and choose your battles, but you come from what you know
[01:00:34.620 --> 01:00:37.580]   and the kind of products you know. And Apple has been really good about it.
[01:00:37.580 --> 01:00:42.060]   They went from PCs to mobile. But will they be able to make the leap from
[01:00:42.060 --> 01:00:47.580]   mobile to ambient computing, for example? You never know until all sorts of things happen.
[01:00:47.580 --> 01:00:50.460]   Yeah. Let's take a little break.
[01:00:50.460 --> 01:00:54.780]   Well, okay, before we do, am I missing any other stories?
[01:00:54.780 --> 01:00:58.860]   There is an incoming call glitch on the iPhone X. I've experienced it where
[01:00:58.860 --> 01:01:04.300]   the phone won't ring for 20 seconds or so. Apple says we're looking into it.
[01:01:04.300 --> 01:01:09.340]   I've had that. I've also had, well, you can't swipe to answer it since like 1997 and I haven't had it.
[01:01:09.340 --> 01:01:11.980]   Yeah. So I don't...
[01:01:11.980 --> 01:01:15.500]   There's one thing, the battery health stuff is in the latest beta.
[01:01:15.500 --> 01:01:17.100]   It's only got the new beta.
[01:01:17.100 --> 01:01:17.980]   You've got the new beta.
[01:01:17.980 --> 01:01:18.540]   All right.
[01:01:18.540 --> 01:01:23.660]   Get the beta and it tells you your max. My iPhone X is at 100% of maximum capacity and
[01:01:23.660 --> 01:01:26.140]   is running at peak performance. So I know that at least.
[01:01:26.700 --> 01:01:30.780]   Tim implied that there would be a switch in there to turn off the slow down.
[01:01:30.780 --> 01:01:34.700]   I guess you wouldn't know because you don't have an older phone.
[01:01:34.700 --> 01:01:37.180]   Yeah. I'm going to install it on an older phone later. And this one is not
[01:01:37.180 --> 01:01:39.980]   rolled in Apple's advanced power management yet. So there's nothing to turn on.
[01:01:39.980 --> 01:01:40.460]   All right.
[01:01:40.460 --> 01:01:40.700]   All right.
[01:01:40.700 --> 01:01:42.300]   I'll try it on an older phone later today.
[01:01:42.300 --> 01:01:47.660]   So we'll keep an eye on that. So it's interesting it's happening to you too.
[01:01:47.660 --> 01:01:51.180]   Yeah. On that iPhone X slowed a ring issue.
[01:01:51.180 --> 01:01:52.540]   I just thought I wasn't getting calls.
[01:01:52.540 --> 01:01:53.660]   No, exactly.
[01:01:53.660 --> 01:01:59.420]   What's because other phones would ring and then I wouldn't I wouldn't see it on the iPhone 10.
[01:01:59.420 --> 01:02:01.740]   I'm trying to answer it and there's nothing there.
[01:02:01.740 --> 01:02:05.580]   Also the vibration on iPhone 10. I find the vibration like they're not it's not
[01:02:05.580 --> 01:02:09.980]   quieter, but it's a different like it feels more horizontal where the older iPhones were
[01:02:09.980 --> 01:02:12.380]   more vertical and I would hear them on the table going.
[01:02:12.380 --> 01:02:15.660]   Even if I had the ringer off where this one is more like jee jee jee jee jee jee jee
[01:02:15.660 --> 01:02:18.300]   and I don't hear it as much. So like there's so many things going on.
[01:02:18.300 --> 01:02:19.980]   I thought I was just losing my mind for a while.
[01:02:20.700 --> 01:02:26.780]   This is this article from nine to five Mac says that you can disable the battery
[01:02:26.780 --> 01:02:31.980]   throttling and there is a there's a little you might be hard pressed to see it under the peak
[01:02:31.980 --> 01:02:34.460]   performance capability. There's a disable.
[01:02:34.460 --> 01:02:37.820]   Yeah, it might doesn't have that yours doesn't have that. So it must be sensitive.
[01:02:37.820 --> 01:02:41.260]   Yeah. To the capacity. Yeah, when it's 100% it doesn't show.
[01:02:41.260 --> 01:02:43.100]   It's also only some phones. It's only iPhone.
[01:02:43.100 --> 01:02:46.940]   iPhone SE, iPhone 6, iPhone 6s and iPhone 7 right now.
[01:02:46.940 --> 01:02:47.740]   Yeah. I would have that.
[01:02:47.740 --> 01:02:54.700]   Yeah. So in the three images nine to five Mac shows, if the battery life battery capacity is 100%
[01:02:54.700 --> 01:02:59.500]   you're not you're just going to see normal performance. If it's not or it's an older phone,
[01:02:59.500 --> 01:03:03.900]   we're not sure exactly. But you'll see a disable button. Once you disable it,
[01:03:03.900 --> 01:03:08.140]   that's the image on the right that says this iPhone is experienced and unexpected shutdown
[01:03:08.140 --> 01:03:13.100]   because the battery was unable to deliver the necessary peak power. That's because you knit with
[01:03:13.100 --> 01:03:17.020]   no added that part. You have manually disabled performance management protections.
[01:03:17.020 --> 01:03:21.820]   So those are the three different screens you might start telling you that you have a shutdown.
[01:03:21.820 --> 01:03:23.820]   Because I think a lot of people I don't understand.
[01:03:23.820 --> 01:03:25.980]   I don't know what happened. Yeah. Yeah.
[01:03:25.980 --> 01:03:28.620]   Once it happens and you're like, okay, now I know what I'm choosing between.
[01:03:28.620 --> 01:03:34.940]   Yeah. Yeah. I really I'm a strong believer that you always tell the pilot the operational status
[01:03:34.940 --> 01:03:39.660]   of his or his or her vehicle. And if there's something happening with your phone, don't say,
[01:03:39.660 --> 01:03:43.660]   well, we don't want to confuse the think about I don't want to confuse the user. But
[01:03:43.660 --> 01:03:48.060]   it does no good to say, why is my phone shutting down after eight minutes every time I use it,
[01:03:48.060 --> 01:03:51.740]   broken phone, I'll throw it away and switch to something else. You say that there is a problem
[01:03:51.740 --> 01:03:54.940]   that we're trying to fix and we're trying to create a great, great experience for you.
[01:03:54.940 --> 01:03:56.860]   That's always a mistake to ignore that.
[01:03:56.860 --> 01:03:59.980]   Here's the fourth and final screen from nine to five Mac.
[01:03:59.980 --> 01:04:05.100]   Your battery's health, which added a paragraph, your battery's health is significantly degraded.
[01:04:05.660 --> 01:04:10.140]   An Apple authorized service provider can replace the battery or store full performance capacity.
[01:04:10.140 --> 01:04:15.980]   This seems to me to completely flatten any complaints people had about what Apple was doing.
[01:04:15.980 --> 01:04:21.500]   They're now giving you the information you need. They're giving you a choice and they're explaining
[01:04:21.500 --> 01:04:26.300]   it fully. I think this is exactly the right way to handle this. As you said, Andy.
[01:04:26.300 --> 01:04:31.500]   That should have been day one. Well, you know what? Everybody makes mistakes. The key is learning
[01:04:31.500 --> 01:04:35.980]   from it. No, again, I'm not saying I'm damn them all to hell for having done that.
[01:04:35.980 --> 01:04:39.340]   I'm saying that was an obvious mistake. That was a subtle thing to me.
[01:04:39.340 --> 01:04:47.100]   We mentioned Apple Music on track to overtake Spotify. They say in US, maybe by the summer,
[01:04:47.100 --> 01:04:55.020]   they're growing 5% Spotify, growing 2%. We already said that Apple Watch in the quarterly results.
[01:04:55.020 --> 01:05:01.900]   One of the things Tim Cook said in his analyst call is had its best quarter ever and estimated
[01:05:01.900 --> 01:05:07.740]   18 million shipments in 2017. That number is coming from Canales, not from...
[01:05:07.740 --> 01:05:12.940]   I think he said, though, it was double. He said double, right?
[01:05:12.940 --> 01:05:18.380]   What's interesting about that, though, is that it's once again, there's no market for smartwatches,
[01:05:18.380 --> 01:05:21.660]   but there's a market for Apple Watch. We've followed into it. There was really,
[01:05:21.660 --> 01:05:25.580]   there was iPod, and there were sort of every other MP3 player, an iPad, and sort of every other
[01:05:25.580 --> 01:05:30.140]   tablet. And it's interesting because these are sort of the extraneous categories where like,
[01:05:30.140 --> 01:05:34.220]   you really need a PC and you really need a phone. But if you don't really need something,
[01:05:34.220 --> 01:05:37.980]   then it looks like people are choosing it if they want to, and they're gravitating towards Apple
[01:05:37.980 --> 01:05:41.420]   products when they have that choice. So it's not, I'm choosing between A or B because I need this
[01:05:41.420 --> 01:05:44.940]   thing. I don't really need it, but I like this one. So I'll choose it. And if I don't like this
[01:05:44.940 --> 01:05:47.260]   one, I'm just not going to get anything, which is a really interesting place.
[01:05:47.260 --> 01:05:49.260]   Tim said that it's really weird.
[01:05:49.260 --> 01:05:51.980]   Tim said that three watches were double series two.
[01:05:51.980 --> 01:05:53.260]   Yes, that's right.
[01:05:53.260 --> 01:05:58.620]   But he said 50% growth in revenue. Ben Behren had predicted 17.4 million sales,
[01:05:58.620 --> 01:06:03.820]   or us data you had predicted 17.7 million sales, and Canales came in at 18 million sales. So I think
[01:06:03.820 --> 01:06:08.140]   you can agree that at least there's some agreement. It's in there. And yeah, that is pretty damn
[01:06:08.140 --> 01:06:12.700]   successful. And I've even come around, you know, I think one series three came along.
[01:06:13.660 --> 01:06:19.180]   Some drafts. I found a groove for Apple Watch. I wear mine every day now.
[01:06:19.180 --> 01:06:24.060]   Yeah, it's really weird. I think that this is something we didn't really expect to see
[01:06:24.060 --> 01:06:29.500]   a few years ago that I don't, I still don't think that anybody Apple included has created a
[01:06:29.500 --> 01:06:34.540]   market for smart watches. The success of the Apple Watch is Apple proving that there's a
[01:06:34.540 --> 01:06:39.180]   successful product is a really awesome fitness watch that happened that of course has really
[01:06:39.180 --> 01:06:44.460]   good features that interact with your phone. But we're still not, we're still not getting people
[01:06:44.460 --> 01:06:49.980]   excited about operating out of a computing platform that is your watch. We're getting people excited
[01:06:49.980 --> 01:06:57.660]   about the watch as a platform for fitness information and fitness monitoring. And so,
[01:06:57.660 --> 01:07:00.700]   and they just keep going from strength to strength to strength. It helps that Apple is
[01:07:00.700 --> 01:07:07.660]   probably the only maker that makes a that makes a great fitness device that is also a great watch
[01:07:07.660 --> 01:07:14.700]   as opposed to one or the other. The Telegram app is now back on the app store. It was taken down
[01:07:14.700 --> 01:07:20.780]   because according to Phil Schiller in an email to a Apple fan, there was child pornography in the
[01:07:20.780 --> 01:07:26.940]   app. I in the app is like saying there's child pornography in Safari. I mean, yes, the app,
[01:07:26.940 --> 01:07:33.740]   the app does allow you to create groups. There was a public, apparently a public group with
[01:07:33.740 --> 01:07:39.100]   illegal content. This team decided to take the app from the store, alerted the developer and the
[01:07:39.100 --> 01:07:47.100]   authorities. Telegram says they have protections in place. It's not clear. I looked at the app,
[01:07:47.100 --> 01:07:51.500]   I didn't see any. Does it feel like if it wasn't as an app as high profile as Telegram,
[01:07:51.500 --> 01:07:56.060]   they would have just said, please add the potential adult content warnings or restrict or blah,
[01:07:56.060 --> 01:08:00.220]   blah, blah, and then just let them update. It's not exactly clear to me. Yeah, I feels like this
[01:08:00.220 --> 01:08:03.740]   was overreaction on Apple's part. I know once this is you put child pornography in there,
[01:08:03.740 --> 01:08:09.820]   there's no such thing as they'll get every headline in Congress. Yeah, but there's illegal,
[01:08:09.820 --> 01:08:13.740]   you can get to illegal content in Safari. You can get an illegal content in Apple messages.
[01:08:13.740 --> 01:08:18.220]   You can get to illegal content in any. Remember that was that era where every app that had a
[01:08:18.220 --> 01:08:22.540]   web access had to put an 18 and over protecting content, writing on it and make me sort of worked
[01:08:22.540 --> 01:08:26.140]   our way through that. And now I think I don't think it's just Telegram because I heard that
[01:08:26.140 --> 01:08:30.940]   some forums apps were having it too. So it wasn't direct messaging or even like group private
[01:08:30.940 --> 01:08:36.860]   messaging is if you had a public forum, like, yeah, that was the issue. And some other apps,
[01:08:36.860 --> 01:08:41.820]   I think got hit with that too. But again, it feels like we keep going into these things where
[01:08:41.820 --> 01:08:46.620]   it becomes much bigger issues than it could have been. Telegram has an open API. So it'd be
[01:08:46.620 --> 01:08:51.740]   impossible. I don't know how Telegram, it's not like you have to get approval from Telegram to create
[01:08:51.740 --> 01:08:54.780]   a credit form. It would be like Reddit where they just shut it down when they're alerted to the
[01:08:54.780 --> 01:08:59.580]   content. Like, bad, bad Reddit, subreddit, bad forum, cut it down fine. And then you keep going.
[01:08:59.580 --> 01:09:03.980]   Any event it's back, which, you know, and it's a great app. It's widely used. It was banned in
[01:09:03.980 --> 01:09:09.500]   Iran because people were using it to protest the government. Like any messaging, I really like
[01:09:09.500 --> 01:09:14.700]   Telegram. I don't assume that it's secure because they use their own role, your own encryption. So
[01:09:14.700 --> 01:09:19.660]   it's kind of unprovably secure. But nevertheless, I think it's a really great app. I love the stickers
[01:09:19.660 --> 01:09:26.460]   in it. I'm glad it's back. And yeah, I think that once again, I think the Apple store has issues.
[01:09:26.460 --> 01:09:30.620]   Tileo, if we thought that messaging apps were all about communication, but they're really about
[01:09:30.620 --> 01:09:36.220]   the monetization of stickers. That's really well. Believe me. The stickers are the best in Telegram.
[01:09:36.220 --> 01:09:38.940]   I remember Ben Thompson was saying that's why he got into line because he could just
[01:09:38.940 --> 01:09:43.980]   communicate completely in stickers. Yeah, all stickers all the time. All right, now we're,
[01:09:43.980 --> 01:09:48.220]   I think we covered everything. Anybody issues you guys wanted to bring up before we go to our
[01:09:48.220 --> 01:09:52.940]   picks of the week? My pick of the week. Falcon heavy, baby.
[01:09:52.940 --> 01:10:00.940]   How many Alexes is that? Wow. I'm seeing. I know. Really. We need a new unit to Elon.
[01:10:00.940 --> 01:10:07.740]   Billions, billions. But I'm seeing a lot of tweets on Twitter of that of that dual landing of
[01:10:07.740 --> 01:10:11.500]   one of those moments you'll remember forever. You'll never. I think I'll never forget that
[01:10:11.500 --> 01:10:17.340]   perfect dual landing of the of the founder. I'm going to be watching that on YouTube all night.
[01:10:17.340 --> 01:10:21.900]   Heavy's all night. Side cores. Wow. Just just a beautiful site.
[01:10:21.900 --> 01:10:28.860]   That is. See. They were perfectly synchronized coming in. I mean, I we don't know yet. Do we know
[01:10:28.860 --> 01:10:34.140]   about the rest of the so we're still waiting. We don't know about the third stage, the third booster,
[01:10:34.140 --> 01:10:38.060]   the main location. It looks like a movie. I know you couldn't make it more perfect.
[01:10:38.060 --> 01:10:42.700]   Yeah, that would be a special effects word. I would say, yeah, I mean, it's a good first pass,
[01:10:42.700 --> 01:10:46.460]   but we need those to be a little bit out of sync. We need a little bit of wobble. Come on, man.
[01:10:46.460 --> 01:10:49.580]   Come on. That's just not realistic. Just not realistic.
[01:10:49.580 --> 01:10:56.300]   Second stage engine cut off as planned. So we're just waiting watching the Twitter feed from
[01:10:56.300 --> 01:11:03.660]   SpaceX to see what else there is to say. I had to retweet Jen Frazier who said, I'm not crying.
[01:11:03.660 --> 01:11:08.300]   You're crying. Talk about under promising and over delivering, right? Oh, it might blow up.
[01:11:08.300 --> 01:11:12.700]   It might blow up. Well, I knew as soon as he said that, that's just that's Elon speak for.
[01:11:12.700 --> 01:11:17.740]   You better watch this. Don't miss this one. Don't miss it. It's going to be good either way.
[01:11:17.740 --> 01:11:23.420]   I showed they brought to you by FreshBooks. The easy to use cloud accounting. Now I say accounting,
[01:11:23.420 --> 01:11:27.100]   you know, people think, well, wait a minute, Leo, you use FreshBooks for invoices. Yes,
[01:11:27.100 --> 01:11:33.420]   it starts with invoices. The easiest way to create invoices, invoicing was always the worst part of my
[01:11:33.420 --> 01:11:39.420]   job. I was a freelancer. I'd put it off, put it off, put it off, firing up Excel and Word and
[01:11:39.420 --> 01:11:44.060]   making an invoice. I was invoicing Rogers up in Canada. So I had to convert to Canadian dollars.
[01:11:44.060 --> 01:11:48.620]   All thing was just a nightmare. Once I discovered FreshBooks, my life got better instantly. For
[01:11:48.620 --> 01:11:55.580]   one thing, I got paid more and faster because I would invoice regularly. In fact, on average,
[01:11:55.580 --> 01:11:59.420]   because you can accept credit cards online automatically when you use FreshBooks and you
[01:11:59.420 --> 01:12:03.980]   could put a pay me button right in the invoice, you're going to get paid on average. This is their
[01:12:03.980 --> 01:12:10.780]   own research two times faster. Twice as fast. Plus, you will know at every stage how your business is
[01:12:10.780 --> 01:12:16.140]   doing. It turns out if you use FreshBooks for invoicing, you use their app to keep track of
[01:12:16.140 --> 01:12:19.340]   expenses. You can take a picture of receipts. You can put them right in the invoice if you want.
[01:12:19.340 --> 01:12:25.580]   If you've got now your accounts receivable, you've got your accounts paid, you've got your
[01:12:25.580 --> 01:12:30.700]   outstanding, you've got your expenses, you've got your profit. You know how you're doing it
[01:12:30.700 --> 01:12:35.580]   at any given time, which is something I never knew until tax time. Oh, speaking of tax time,
[01:12:35.580 --> 01:12:40.300]   you're going to love it because you will have all the reports you need, all the
[01:12:40.300 --> 01:12:46.460]   balance, everything, expenses to bring to your accountants so you can get those taxes done faster.
[01:12:46.460 --> 01:12:52.540]   No more chasing clients for payments. No more waiting in line at the bank to deposit a check,
[01:12:52.540 --> 01:12:57.900]   except credit cards directly from the invoice. Create proposals now with rich text content,
[01:12:57.900 --> 01:13:03.260]   images, customizable sections. FreshBooks automatically connects to your bank account
[01:13:03.260 --> 01:13:09.180]   and updates expenses daily. So you do less data entry. Of course, you can always take a picture of
[01:13:09.180 --> 01:13:13.340]   the receipt and upload it and let FreshBooks do the rest. They'll enter it in and everything.
[01:13:13.340 --> 01:13:17.020]   From payment reminders to late fees, automate as much or as little as you'd like to so you can
[01:13:17.020 --> 01:13:22.220]   get back to doing what you love and let the money come in. It feels like almost automatically. Make

[01:13:38.220 --> 01:13:44.300]   We'd appreciate it. FreshBooks.com/macbreak was a lifesaver for me. I know it will be
[01:13:44.300 --> 01:13:51.180]   for you. Andy and I go your pick of the week. My pick of the week is actually a movie that I
[01:13:51.180 --> 01:13:56.780]   saw on Netflix last week that kind of blew my mind. It's called AlphaGo. It's about Google's
[01:13:56.780 --> 01:14:04.380]   DeepMind project. Got to watch this. It's about the famous Go app that their London office created
[01:14:04.380 --> 01:14:10.300]   to play Go which marketing-wise, supposed to be, oh, 8 million times more complicated than
[01:14:10.300 --> 01:14:18.860]   chess. I was sort of expecting a really, really nerdy app about, excuse me, a movie about how
[01:14:18.860 --> 01:14:24.140]   artificial intelligence works and engineers pouring over, well, there is some scenes of
[01:14:24.140 --> 01:14:28.460]   engineers pouring over whiteboards with colored markers. But that's only like setting up the
[01:14:28.460 --> 01:14:35.260]   movie. The rest of it is about this match that the app played against the number one ranked
[01:14:35.260 --> 01:14:40.300]   Go player in the world. It really turns into amusing on the relationship between
[01:14:40.300 --> 01:14:50.300]   humans and games and thought processes and their relationship to these games and how
[01:14:51.980 --> 01:14:59.500]   playing both for the AI and for the human player, playing against someone who's operating on a level
[01:14:59.500 --> 01:15:06.220]   as yet unknown to them can totally transform their thoughts about how they're playing the game
[01:15:06.220 --> 01:15:11.500]   and what the nature of the game is. It really turns into something very, very beautiful.
[01:15:11.500 --> 01:15:18.540]   And part of the fun is unlike Deep Blue, the one that beat Gary Kasparov and Chesed had the
[01:15:18.540 --> 01:15:24.220]   latest big, oh, the human mind, between against the machine mind
[01:15:24.220 --> 01:15:34.060]   movie from ages ago. Unlike that which is that app was programmed step by step. It was old-fashioned
[01:15:34.060 --> 01:15:40.540]   programming, whereas AlphaGo is AI. So you have the engineers in some back room watching real-time
[01:15:40.540 --> 01:15:46.380]   charts that are showing how this app, this AI is thinking and they're not mastered Go players
[01:15:46.380 --> 01:15:52.940]   either. They just simply created software for this app to teach itself Go by playing
[01:15:52.940 --> 01:15:57.340]   artificial games and games against real players. So even there, I don't know what the hell it's
[01:15:57.340 --> 01:16:05.260]   thinking right now. Meanwhile, this wasn't like the series of five games, this five game match.
[01:16:05.260 --> 01:16:10.540]   It wasn't, there are people who are nuts for Go. And it was held in South Korea, the country of
[01:16:10.540 --> 01:16:15.580]   this world champion. And so it's being covered on television. You have live Go commentators with
[01:16:15.580 --> 01:16:20.780]   the big like fake Go board, and we're saying, oh, it looks either that was the most brilliant
[01:16:20.780 --> 01:16:25.340]   move ever, or it's just given up territory. I don't know why it made that move. So it gets super,
[01:16:25.340 --> 01:16:29.820]   super exciting. And it was one of those I should be in, I should have been in bed an
[01:16:29.820 --> 01:16:35.580]   hour ago, but I am not, I know I have the ability to turn this off and pick it up again tomorrow,
[01:16:35.580 --> 01:16:40.300]   but I want to see the end of it. So it's on Netflix, AlphaGo, one of my favorite movies I've seen so far
[01:16:40.300 --> 01:16:45.260]   this year. Wow, I will be watching it because I was one of those nerds watching the TV broadcast
[01:16:45.260 --> 01:16:51.980]   for eight hours with a big board. Because I'm, I was a big fascinated by the whole thing,
[01:16:51.980 --> 01:16:57.180]   a big fan of Go too. It's a great game. Not nearly as good as, as I'm just a complete duffer. But
[01:16:57.180 --> 01:17:01.740]   boy, yeah, I can't wait to see that. Watch that. Don't watch that stupid Cloverfield paradox
[01:17:01.740 --> 01:17:05.100]   that we're advertising on the Super Bowl. I'm gonna see a Falcon land on a go board now.
[01:17:05.100 --> 01:17:09.420]   Now that would be cool. Renee Richie, your pick of the week. So I have two, the first one is kind
[01:17:09.420 --> 01:17:14.940]   of self-serving. Today with the HomePod, I launched the video version, the YouTube version of Vector.
[01:17:15.500 --> 01:17:21.900]   So if you want to see me podcast rather than just hear me, you'll be able to watch a lot.
[01:17:21.900 --> 01:17:26.300]   Some people like to watch along as you know from the Macbreak podcast. So this is up. It's a baby
[01:17:26.300 --> 01:17:30.140]   YouTube channel. I don't even have a proper URL for it yet. I know I can't afford one of those yet,
[01:17:30.140 --> 01:17:34.460]   but it's going to grow. So if people like the Vector podcast, they can watch it in video now.
[01:17:34.460 --> 01:17:41.100]   Awesome. imore.com/vector and your second pick? Yes. My second pick is this little guy. This is a
[01:17:41.100 --> 01:17:46.940]   hue motion sensor. And again, as I move, I decided to really go in on the HomeKit stuff.
[01:17:46.940 --> 01:17:51.100]   And this is by the same people who make hue light bulbs. You just get it and you add it to your hue
[01:17:51.100 --> 01:17:56.860]   app and then you place it somewhere and you assign automation programs to it. So for example,
[01:17:56.860 --> 01:18:01.900]   this one just sits on a shelf in the bathroom. And anytime you walk into the bathroom, it just
[01:18:01.900 --> 01:18:05.100]   turns on the lights, which sounds really dumb. But when you wake up in the middle of the night and
[01:18:05.100 --> 01:18:08.380]   you walk over and you're futzing with a light switch, it's way better if the lights just
[01:18:08.380 --> 01:18:13.020]   automatically come on. And then they turn off again after whatever length of time you set it.
[01:18:13.020 --> 01:18:17.820]   But wait, there's more. It's also smart. So for example, in the daytime, when it's bright,
[01:18:17.820 --> 01:18:21.820]   it'll put the lights on maximum. In the early morning or late night hours or at night,
[01:18:21.820 --> 01:18:25.340]   it'll have them very dim, almost like a night light effect. So it doesn't blow your retina out
[01:18:25.340 --> 01:18:30.780]   through the back of your skull when you stumble in there. And it does that. Oh, and you can do
[01:18:30.780 --> 01:18:35.420]   so great. Because of HomeKit, I know some people don't like HomeKit because it's an apple thing,
[01:18:35.420 --> 01:18:38.860]   but they've got a lot of things that other home solutions don't provide. For example,
[01:18:38.860 --> 01:18:42.460]   you can make these rooms and homes, but you can also do scenes and you can do groups and you can
[01:18:42.460 --> 01:18:47.100]   do a whole bunch of stuff. And it's got really, really good automation. And you can have it so that
[01:18:47.100 --> 01:18:51.580]   if the motion detector sees you come in, you can start chaining events. Like if the motion detector
[01:18:51.580 --> 01:18:55.420]   trips, put the coffee pot on or turn on the lights up the stairs because you know you're going to
[01:18:55.420 --> 01:19:00.700]   be in the stairs next. And you can really start to pull out. Like you can't do a lot with it yet,
[01:19:00.700 --> 01:19:04.940]   but you can start to do these little basic programs that just make makes life even like laser. Like
[01:19:04.940 --> 01:19:09.580]   saying, yo, Jimbo, turn on my lights is just too much work now. I want to just be there.
[01:19:09.580 --> 01:19:13.500]   I was all excited because I can do that now. Now I have to get the motion sensor because I
[01:19:13.500 --> 01:19:16.860]   that's too much work. Oh, and there's also switches. I'll talk with those on another show,
[01:19:16.860 --> 01:19:20.300]   but you can get switches for people who just insist on turning off all your hue lights and then
[01:19:20.300 --> 01:19:23.980]   like you could put a fake switch on there. Oh, that's good. Let them control them. And they think that
[01:19:23.980 --> 01:19:28.300]   they're that they have real world power over them. Yeah, it's really great when you start getting
[01:19:28.300 --> 01:19:32.380]   into it. So this guy, you just you put it, you have to adjust it a little bit to make sure you
[01:19:32.380 --> 01:19:36.860]   don't walk by the room and it turns on. But once you get it in the right place, it's really robust.
[01:19:36.860 --> 01:19:41.020]   And I put them in like the laundry room, the bathroom. Yeah, there's a storage room just
[01:19:41.020 --> 01:19:44.460]   because I don't my hands are full. I don't want to have to flex for the lights. It just turns on.
[01:19:44.460 --> 01:19:48.300]   And then it turns off on its own. That's really good. Yeah. Yeah, I like
[01:19:48.300 --> 01:19:53.900]   $40 hue motion sensor. And of course, it only works if you have hue lights and a hue home base.
[01:19:53.900 --> 01:19:57.900]   So you're going to get all the hues to I've been slowly. My other motion sensors too.
[01:19:57.900 --> 01:20:02.220]   My hue possessions. Are there ones that work with you? I don't think I don't I
[01:20:02.220 --> 01:20:05.260]   why this ones that work with home kit and then you could have the home kit automation. So you
[01:20:05.260 --> 01:20:08.780]   have the motion sensor is triggered trigger the hue. Yeah, he just gives you really good
[01:20:08.780 --> 01:20:13.740]   integration with the hue lights. Nice. I want to recommend a program Chris Mark work told me about
[01:20:13.740 --> 01:20:20.220]   Sunday on the radio show or photography guru. And I mentioned this is my pick on iPad iOS today
[01:20:20.220 --> 01:20:24.620]   because I thought it was really cool. But I want to also mention it here from the folks at Prisma,
[01:20:24.620 --> 01:20:31.660]   something called sticky AI, Android as well as iOS. And what it could just show you real
[01:20:31.660 --> 01:20:38.780]   quickly what it does is it allows you to take a picture and turn it into a sticker change the
[01:20:38.780 --> 01:20:44.060]   background on it. You can have a transparent background. You can have different looks.
[01:20:44.060 --> 01:20:50.540]   It's it's Prisma, right? So you recognize these looks. You can add text to it if you want a
[01:20:50.540 --> 01:20:56.220]   variety of colors. And then you can add it to your iOS stickers or put it in your photo book. But
[01:20:56.220 --> 01:21:00.540]   the thing that's really cool about it, let me show you in real time. So you can you can get what
[01:21:00.540 --> 01:21:06.460]   it does is that it will somehow magically know what to cut out. So I'm gonna take a selfie of
[01:21:06.460 --> 01:21:12.700]   myself in not the most propitious circumstances. It's not like I'm on a green screen. Oh, and in
[01:21:12.700 --> 01:21:17.340]   fact, it did get a little bit confused by the gear behind my head. Let me do let me do one more of
[01:21:17.340 --> 01:21:22.220]   those just segmentation masking you. Yeah, it's doing something clever. I don't know exactly what it is.
[01:21:22.220 --> 01:21:30.220]   There we go. Yeah, there it did a pretty good job. I looked demented, but it did a pretty good
[01:21:30.220 --> 01:21:34.700]   job. So that's completely I didn't have to do anything. It automatically cut the background out.
[01:21:34.700 --> 01:21:40.220]   And now I can place myself in other circumstances. I can make a sticker. I can I can mess around with
[01:21:40.220 --> 01:21:44.700]   it. It's got a lot more features that I didn't even know about the Megan showed me just because
[01:21:45.500 --> 01:21:50.460]   she played with it. But it's it's pretty cool. So that's this is called sticky AI. It's free
[01:21:50.460 --> 01:21:57.260]   from the folks at Prisma who know how to mess with stuff and and do a good job of it. They're
[01:21:57.260 --> 01:22:03.820]   very clever. It uses an artificial neural network. Create your own still and by the way, animated
[01:22:03.820 --> 01:22:09.820]   stickers as well. She created a great animated sticker. That was just fantastic. In fact, I should
[01:22:09.820 --> 01:22:13.980]   I should show you that. That's well, I'll leave that as an exercise for the reader.
[01:22:13.980 --> 01:22:19.100]   Thank you everybody. Thank you, Renee Richie. You'll find him at i'more.com. Don't forget the new
[01:22:19.100 --> 01:22:27.180]   vector podcast with video at i'more.com/vector and his fantastic 10,000 word. Well, you did 10,000
[01:22:27.180 --> 01:22:33.340]   words of 50 minute podcast, multiple videos, his unreview of the HomePod. It's all there if
[01:22:33.340 --> 01:22:38.300]   you're interested in learning more about the HomePod and Renee got the briefing in Cupertino.
[01:22:38.300 --> 01:22:42.780]   That's why it was down there last week. So he has a lot of insight information. Thank you, Renee.
[01:22:42.780 --> 01:22:49.980]   As always, thank you to Andy and Aco. He's our man from the Chicago Sun Times and always a lot
[01:22:49.980 --> 01:22:57.100]   of fun having you on the show. You'll find Andy at his website, cwob.com and on the Twitter at i-h-n-a-t
[01:22:57.100 --> 01:23:02.220]   K. Oh, you're posting a lot of stuff now on that. That's good. You get getting out.
[01:23:02.220 --> 01:23:06.780]   I'm getting more active. I haven't posted a little while. That's just just a new layout.
[01:23:06.780 --> 01:23:13.100]   I like it. Thank you, Andrew. Thank you, Renee. We do Mac break weekly every Tuesday, right after
[01:23:13.100 --> 01:23:18.940]   iOS today, usually around 11 a.m. Pacific, 2 p.m. Eastern. That would be 1900 UTC if you want to
[01:23:18.940 --> 01:23:26.380]   stop by and say hi, go to twit.tv/live. Join us in the chatroom at IRC.twit.tv. There's always
[01:23:26.380 --> 01:23:29.900]   somebody in there. They're always having a lot of fun. You can also be in studio, nice studio
[01:23:29.900 --> 01:23:33.820]   audience today, slowly growing throughout the show. I don't know why, but all you have to do
[01:23:33.820 --> 01:23:39.740]   is email tickets@twit.tv. We'll put a chair out for you. You can also hear us now as part of your
[01:23:39.740 --> 01:23:47.980]   flash briefing in many countries, including Renee's own, Canadian. I got the list down here somewhere.
[01:23:47.980 --> 01:23:54.940]   They've added flash briefings to your Amazon Echo in Canada, Australia, the United Kingdom,
[01:23:54.940 --> 01:24:01.100]   and India. If you have an Echo in one of those countries, in the US, of course, you can go to
[01:24:01.100 --> 01:24:07.180]   your Echo app and search under flash briefing for Twit and add our briefing. We put a little
[01:24:07.180 --> 01:24:11.740]   two-minute segment of shows, different shows every day throughout the week, and it's a great
[01:24:11.740 --> 01:24:18.140]   way to have your flash briefing enhanced by a little bit of a Twit. Also, once more, I'd like to
[01:24:18.140 --> 01:24:21.980]   ask for your help. If you haven't yet taken the Twit survey, once a year we do this,
[01:24:21.980 --> 01:24:26.940]   get a little bit better idea of the audience, helps us sell advertising, helps us make better
[01:24:26.940 --> 01:24:31.420]   programs for you. The survey should just take a few minutes of your time. It's just a few questions
[01:24:31.420 --> 01:24:40.460]   at twit.tv/survey. Honestly, as I say there on that page, we are not collecting any personal
[01:24:40.460 --> 01:24:45.900]   information. Anything you're at all uncomfortable with, don't answer. But this is not about you
[01:24:45.900 --> 01:24:49.980]   individually. This is about the audience as an aggregate. We don't save your email address. We
[01:24:49.980 --> 01:24:55.500]   don't email you. We don't save any of that information. It's just to get a picture of the
[01:24:55.500 --> 01:24:59.900]   audience as a whole, not of any individual. You can trust us. One of the reasons we have to do this
[01:24:59.900 --> 01:25:03.500]   is because we don't collect any information about you any other time during the year.
[01:25:03.500 --> 01:25:09.020]   Twit.tv/survey. Thank you everybody for being here, security now coming up next.
[01:25:09.020 --> 01:25:19.180]   I'm sorry to say it's time now to get back to work because break time is over. Bye-bye.
[01:25:19.180 --> 01:25:24.700]   [music]
