[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:19.000]   Time for Mac Break Weekly. And he's here. Renee Richie's here. We're going to talk about the latest Apple news, including, I think, an interesting rumor about a new 10 and a half inch iPad and why that might make sense. It's all coming up. Of course, Paul comes lawsuit with Apple. That's a billion dollar question mark. What's going on? We'll talk about it next on Mac Break Weekly.

[00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly, the show where we cover the latest news from Apple, of which there is a dearth, but that's okay because it's January.
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   Andy Inako is here. Wintertime Andy. The Chicago Sun.
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:19.000]   Oh, good heavens. Yeah. The only, I keep telling myself for the past two days, if all of this freezing rain were snow, I would be digging out until March.
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   But it's freezing and it's raining so badly that I can't go out on my bike, I can't go out for a walk, and it's just...
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   It's got to be extra... And basically, it's been the sort of weekend where it's like with one thing or another, it's like...
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   Remember how every Christmas, at least two people will give me whiskey or something, even though I'm not really a drinker?
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   Let's get all those bottles off and just try to get the nickel back in those recycling.
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   I'm going to be extra special today. You need a barrel around your neck like a Saint Bernard.
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   Also from the frozen north, Renee Ritchie, iMore.com. Power outages today. We hope we'll keep you online.
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   Yeah, we were supposed to get 15 to 20 centimeters of snow, but it was too warm, so we got freezing rain and that always brings down the power line.
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   So it's been off and on all day, but it's been on for the last couple hours, and I have UPS set up, so hopefully everything's going to be perfect.
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   Man, I know how you guys feel. My God, it's like 54 degrees here and it's raining.
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   Oh, Leah, how are you surviving?
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   You actually had to let the cats in last night.
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   We did. We did.
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.000]   Okay, let's see. Top story.
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   Well, I guess one thing we should start with, because it'll be of use to our audience,
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   yesterday, 10.2 to 0.1, iOS came out on all iOS platforms, watch TV, iPad and iPhone.
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   And I was reading tidbits, and Adam Anxton Crew said, "Don't do it right away. You never know."
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   But I haven't heard any howls of pain to date.
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   Yeah, I do it right away just so that...
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   Well, you want to be the howler. Your job is to help.
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   Yes. Yes.
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   I'm also going to take some of the security updates are kind of important, so
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   if you want to take a risk, take a risk.
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   As usual, though, you keep all system updates way the hell off of your devices.
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   If it's like two days before you're about to take a long trip.
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   Yeah.
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000]   Because you don't want to room for that.
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   We actually, unusually, Apple pushed...
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   Usually they take a while to get those notes up on what was fixed,
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   but they did it immediately.
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:29.000]   In fact, Jason Stonel and I were doing iOS today, and I actually did the updates on the iPad and iPhone.
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   And then overnight I did it on the Apple Watch.
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:38.000]   But we were able to see, and there were a considerable number of security fixes.
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.000]   Like, I didn't count them, but like 20.
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000]   It looked like a huge long list.
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   A lot of WebKit issues, cross-site scripting, kernel panics, all sorts of things.
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   So this is a big security update.
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.000]   Do you think it's because Pwnedown is coming up in a couple months?
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000]   I mean, what...
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   Or just...
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   Do they collect them? How does this work?
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   Do they collect it and do it once a month like Microsoft does?
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:01.000]   It's opportunistic.
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:05.000]   So as they come in, they figure out, they triage it, they figure out how to change it.
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   Because, you know, it's not just as simple as fixing it.
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.000]   It's making sure that there's no repercussions from fixing it.
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.000]   There's a famous story about a Safari bug that got fixed that then crippled everything else,
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:17.000]   because people have been programming against that bug for so many years.
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000]   So they have to do a lot of testing and making sure that it works.
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.000]   And then whenever the next available release, they'll do emergency patches if they need to.
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:26.000]   But whenever the next patch is ready, they'll push it out with everything else.
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   Is it...
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   Okay.
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   Is it...
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:31.000]   So...
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   Because we just also got the new beta for...
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:34.000]   What is it?
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:35.000]   10.3?
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000]   Yeah, and iOS 10.3.
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:38.000]   Yeah, iOS 10.3.
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000]   Mac OS watch...
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:41.000]   Watch...
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   I don't think the beta is out or not yet, but the release notes for it or out.
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:45.000]   Okay.
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:46.000]   So...
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:47.000]   We're getting...
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:51.000]   In other words, we're getting close to a new version of 10.3.
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.000]   I'm just trying to find what the timing is.
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   The exciting thing here is that developers are going to be able to respond to reviews for the first time.
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:02.000]   Hopefully sober and with good sense of humor, but they'll have the ability to...
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:03.000]   I think that's important.
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   They had that in the Android Play Store.
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000]   And what it does is it makes developers...
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:12.000]   Well, first of all, it makes them sit up and pay attention and take these reviews seriously,
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000]   because what happens in the Android Play Store is you get bug reports.
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.000]   This doesn't work here, and you'll see the developer respond.
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   We're working on that or we're sorry that that happened.
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000]   I find that very valuable.
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.000]   And I think it does eliminate a lot of bogus reports.
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:28.000]   And there's some fairness too, because if there is an issue that it's not the developer,
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000]   the developer just simply can't address.
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.000]   For example, I put this on the new beta version and the developers like,
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.000]   "I can't upload against a new beta.
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.000]   Sorry, you have to wait."
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000]   It gives them a way to get their story out.
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   Right.
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000]   All right.
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:47.000]   So at this point, I don't think there's any reason not to do 10 to 1,
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:51.000]   and I think there are a lot of good reasons to do it properly, yes?
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   Yeah.
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:53.000]   It was fine for me.
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000]   I haven't seen anyone complaining about it.
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.000]   The security fixes, like Andy said, are significant.
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:01.000]   And Apple's already pushing out the new betas for the next version,
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   so they must be pretty confident that the past ones are behind them.
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:05.000]   All right.
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.000]   Well, then let's talk about 10.3.
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:10.000]   You mentioned it's very timely for me.
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:11.000]   Find my AirPods.
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:12.000]   Yeah.
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:13.000]   Find my AirPods.
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:17.000]   So we sort of hinted at this on Macbreak Weekly, because we were talking about the removal of the app
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   that did find my AirPods, and that it's often not the best thing to try and do a feature.
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.000]   That Apple might be imminently rolling out.
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.000]   And yeah, they were imminently rolling that out.
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.000]   So this builds right into Find My iPhone.
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.000]   You go in and it identifies it just like it does any sort of iOS device.
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:30.000]   It's Bluetooth only.
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   It doesn't have Wi-Fi built in, obviously, but it will tell you within the last known Bluetooth
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:37.000]   coordinates of the device.
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:42.000]   So hopefully, and it can make a sound out of one or both of them, depending on which one or both you think you've lost.
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:43.000]   Okay.
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.000]   Are those the two big features?
[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.000]   Developer response and Find My AirPods.
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:48.000]   There's new Siri domains.
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.000]   They're kind of subtle, though.
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   They're mostly for transactions and existing domains.
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000]   Siri's getting support for Cricket, which is time.
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:58.000]   I mean, some people would say arguably it's way too late for Cricket, because it's awkward to support.
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000]   Oh, Cricket, the game.
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:01.000]   Yeah, the game.
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:02.000]   Sorry.
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:03.000]   Yeah.
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:04.000]   Ground-based.
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:05.000]   Well, what would Cricket be then?
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:06.000]   Okay.
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:07.000]   Got it.
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:11.000]   So you can't ask Siri for Cricket scores now, but you will.
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:12.000]   Yeah.
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:13.000]   You'll be able to.
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:14.000]   There's new car play shortcuts.
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:17.000]   HomeKit now supports programmable light switches.
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:30.000]   So there's a bunch of really, there's nothing big like there was in 9.3, where suddenly it got a whole ton of new iPad specific features, which is kind of a bummer, because there were no really big iPad features in 10.0, and everyone was kind of hoping that they do a repeat.
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:34.000]   And suddenly we get like drag and drop or something in 10.3, but alas, no.
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:37.000]   If this is more, oh, and I'm burying the lead here.
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:38.000]   Totally.
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:39.000]   Apple file system is turned on.
[00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:40.000]   What?
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:41.000]   It's a big deal under the hood.
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:42.000]   Yeah.
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.000]   You got a note saying you please make sure you back up because we're flipping the switch.
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.000]   That's for Mac OS or for iOS.
[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:48.000]   For iOS.
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.000]   Now we also got a Mac OS update.
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.000]   That's the official update, not a beta yet.
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:54.000]   We did get the beta as well.
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:55.000]   We also got a thing.
[00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:56.000]   Yeah.
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:57.000]   Like night shift is coming to the max.
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:02.000]   So people who've been upset that they could do it on iOS, but had to use the utility like flux for the Mac OS.
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000]   They now get the built in version for that.
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.000]   Go to stop using your Mac.
[00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:07.000]   Go to bed.
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.000]   That's just just put up the things.
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:10.000]   No, no.
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:11.000]   Go to bed.
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:12.000]   Yeah.
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:13.000]   Lights out.
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:14.000]   Lights out.
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:18.000]   And watch OS is coming, which is getting a lot of the Siri kit things and also theater mode.
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:23.000]   So you can it'll keep the screen completely off and just give you haptic notifications so it doesn't keep popping on.
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:24.000]   Oh, I like that.
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:25.000]   Oh, I like that.
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:26.000]   It had a theater mode before.
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.000]   Was it just dimming it?
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:29.000]   It wasn't real theater mode.
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:32.000]   It was do not disturb, but the screen would still come on if there was a notification.
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:33.000]   At the same time you got the tap.
[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:36.000]   Now the screen stays off, but the tap stays on.
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:37.000]   That's cool.
[00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:41.000]   So you know something's happening, but you don't know what it is.
[00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.000]   Do you, Mr. Jones?
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:51.000]   Oh, and every well, I mean, with the Siri kit stuff, everyone gets sort of the Nike plus style integration where your workout app can now be controlled over Siri, not just the built in wise.
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:52.000]   Nice.
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:53.000]   I'm really okay.
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:10:01.000]   So let's take a break, but I want to dive into AFS because I didn't realize we were getting close, but as I remember, actually, they said spring, right?
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.000]   Early 2017.
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.000]   Not AFS though in the Mac OS beta.
[00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.000]   I didn't have a chance to look at that yet.
[00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.000]   I was still parsing my way through, but I'll take a look while you're.
[00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:10.000]   Oh, yeah.
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:11.000]   Please do.
[00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:15.000]   I'm guessing that's not going to be as aggressive because it's not the same as a controlled environment.
[00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:20.000]   I'm amazed that they're turned it on first on iOS, but yes, that's why I guess.
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.000]   Oh my gosh.
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.000]   So, okay, well, let's take a break.
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:25.000]   Future is now.
[00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:26.000]   We have a lot of questions.
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:27.000]   Well, I'm very excited.
[00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.000]   And frankly, I didn't think it would happen.
[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:36.000]   I thought it would be like pink, you know, or long horn and then on the windows side.
[00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.000]   These companies really try to do these really important.
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:45.600]   When Fs, yeah, when Fs, these upgrades that really are long overdue and make a huge difference,
[00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:53.000]   but it's so risky to the installed base that they usually turn at the last moment.
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.000]   They plan chicken with you hard.
[00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:56.000]   We're only or something.
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:57.000]   Right.
[00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:58.000]   All right.
[00:10:58.000 --> 00:10:59.000]   Good.
[00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:00.000]   Oh, I want to talk about AFS.
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:01.000]   Andy and I go here.
[00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:02.000]   Talk to me.
[00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:03.000]   Just say something, Andy.
[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:04.000]   You look great today.
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:09.000]   So the weirdest thing is happening with Andy.
[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.000]   What else is there?
[00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:16.080]   If he doesn't talk, the audio quality dives on Skype.
[00:11:16.080 --> 00:11:17.800]   And then as he talks, it gets back up.
[00:11:17.800 --> 00:11:19.840]   It's like Skype saying, you're not using the band.
[00:11:19.840 --> 00:11:24.120]   This must be some new, fangled Skype thing that's going to drive us crazy.
[00:11:24.120 --> 00:11:28.200]   I think there's, it's part of that artificial intelligence, like smart learning realizes
[00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:32.840]   that every time Andy talks on the show, it's nothing but pops noise and garbage and send
[00:11:32.840 --> 00:11:33.840]   low, low bandwidth.
[00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:38.960]   If I'm not getting anything from that channel, I should fill it with just random noise that
[00:11:38.960 --> 00:11:39.960]   people should ignore.
[00:11:39.960 --> 00:11:42.880]   Do you hear how that happened?
[00:11:42.880 --> 00:11:45.320]   That's going to make me crazy.
[00:11:45.320 --> 00:11:47.760]   What can we do, John and Brian?
[00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:51.560]   We will recon order while you read the ad.
[00:11:51.560 --> 00:11:54.000]   Reconnoit, Andy will fly in over the break.
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:55.000]   Yeah.
[00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:56.000]   Wind out reboot.
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:57.000]   And we've never had that happen.
[00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:58.000]   But he did reboot, didn't he?
[00:11:58.000 --> 00:11:59.000]   No, Renee did.
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:00.000]   Not.
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:01.000]   Okay.
[00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:02.000]   Here's your opportunity to reboot.
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.000]   The next thing that must be a new behavior from Skype.
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:09.880]   Steve Gibson was complaining a couple of weeks ago because we used to do, and this was always
[00:12:09.880 --> 00:12:10.880]   the best way to do it.
[00:12:10.880 --> 00:12:14.680]   And we used to do it on all our shows point to point so you could put a port in on Skype
[00:12:14.680 --> 00:12:15.920]   and say, use this port.
[00:12:15.920 --> 00:12:19.360]   And then it would bypass, and that was back what Skype was before Microsoft acquired.
[00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:21.520]   I'm supernoting everything.
[00:12:21.520 --> 00:12:24.280]   And if you didn't want to be on a super node, you just said, no, no, we're going to use
[00:12:24.280 --> 00:12:26.080]   the same port and it would go directly.
[00:12:26.080 --> 00:12:27.920]   And it was always the best way to do it.
[00:12:27.920 --> 00:12:34.680]   And Microsoft bottom eliminated supernoting, eliminated the ability to choose a port, forced
[00:12:34.680 --> 00:12:36.560]   you to go through Microsoft servers.
[00:12:36.560 --> 00:12:37.680]   Steve wasn't happy about that.
[00:12:37.680 --> 00:12:42.160]   And he said, he thought that was why his audio was declining, but it was only Steve.
[00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:44.200]   And now the other guy's audio is declining.
[00:12:44.200 --> 00:12:45.200]   I'm, I'm baffled.
[00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:46.200]   We'll figure it out.
[00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:48.040]   We're going to work on it.
[00:12:48.040 --> 00:12:52.000]   Meanwhile, let's update all the skipes everywhere all over the land.
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:55.520]   Meanwhile, let me talk about this little teeny, weeny thing.
[00:12:55.520 --> 00:12:56.520]   This is a tracker.
[00:12:56.520 --> 00:12:58.120]   The awesomest.
[00:12:58.120 --> 00:12:59.120]   This is so cool.
[00:12:59.120 --> 00:13:05.360]   By the way, this tracker has Mac break weekly printed on it using that UV LED printing.
[00:13:05.360 --> 00:13:06.520]   It's anodized aluminum.
[00:13:06.520 --> 00:13:07.520]   Okay.
[00:13:07.520 --> 00:13:08.520]   It's very light.
[00:13:08.520 --> 00:13:13.680]   It's about the size you have a quarter or maybe like a dog tag for your pet, a little
[00:13:13.680 --> 00:13:14.680]   tag.
[00:13:14.680 --> 00:13:16.800]   But here's the deal on this.
[00:13:16.800 --> 00:13:18.160]   It's a Bluetooth tracker.
[00:13:18.160 --> 00:13:23.520]   So that means it's got Bluetooth LE built in and you pair it to your phone.
[00:13:23.520 --> 00:13:27.680]   You could, your phone can track up to 10 devices with a tracker, put it on your purse, put
[00:13:27.680 --> 00:13:32.280]   it on your keys, put it in your wallet, put it on your bike in your luggage.
[00:13:32.280 --> 00:13:36.200]   Yeah, on your pets, they have a waterproof cover that makes it very suitable for pets.
[00:13:36.200 --> 00:13:39.600]   And then when you lose something, you can find it.
[00:13:39.600 --> 00:13:41.180]   And that's the key.
[00:13:41.180 --> 00:13:44.040]   The average American, I asked them for this number.
[00:13:44.040 --> 00:13:46.040]   They told me, waste 55 minutes a day.
[00:13:46.040 --> 00:13:50.040]   I thought it was 40 minutes, almost an hour a day looking for stuff they have, but can't
[00:13:50.040 --> 00:13:51.040]   find.
[00:13:51.040 --> 00:13:55.080]   God, that's, add that up.
[00:13:55.080 --> 00:14:00.000]   That's billions of hours every year wasted.
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:03.880]   This is my, this is our single bid to make America more productive and everywhere in
[00:14:03.880 --> 00:14:06.480]   the world too, for that matter.
[00:14:06.480 --> 00:14:09.440]   Tracker makes losing things a thing of the past.
[00:14:09.440 --> 00:14:11.160]   And I'm going to tell you how you can get one for free.
[00:14:11.160 --> 00:14:12.960]   So here's the deal.
[00:14:12.960 --> 00:14:14.880]   It does a couple of different location things.
[00:14:14.880 --> 00:14:19.440]   It doesn't obviously have GPS built into it that that would, that would not work.
[00:14:19.440 --> 00:14:21.000]   So use the GPS on your phone.
[00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:23.120]   That's why you pair it to your phone with Bluetooth, Ellie.
[00:14:23.120 --> 00:14:24.120]   That's very low power.
[00:14:24.120 --> 00:14:25.220]   That's good.
[00:14:25.220 --> 00:14:29.680]   You can if, if you don't mind using a little more power set it set up two way separation
[00:14:29.680 --> 00:14:30.680]   alerts.
[00:14:30.680 --> 00:14:34.040]   So if you leave your phone behind your tracker, we'll go beep, beep, beep.
[00:14:34.040 --> 00:14:37.240]   If you leave your tracker behind your phone, we'll go beep, beep, beep.
[00:14:37.240 --> 00:14:41.960]   And there's a button on the tracker you can push that will make your phone make noise,
[00:14:41.960 --> 00:14:44.160]   even if it's silenced.
[00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:45.980]   So all in all, that's right there.
[00:14:45.980 --> 00:14:49.440]   If I put this on my keys, I've solved two big problems leaving my keys behind, leaving
[00:14:49.440 --> 00:14:50.440]   my phone behind.
[00:14:50.440 --> 00:14:53.880]   That's probably 90% of that 55 minutes a day.
[00:14:53.880 --> 00:14:58.240]   The other thing I love about the tracker, the, it goes a year, you know, in normal use.
[00:14:58.240 --> 00:15:01.800]   If you don't turn on all the features like the separation alerts, it goes a year.
[00:15:01.800 --> 00:15:04.080]   If you don't beep it all the time.
[00:15:04.080 --> 00:15:06.600]   But you can always replace the battery.
[00:15:06.600 --> 00:15:08.680]   And so those little coin size batteries are inexpensive.
[00:15:08.680 --> 00:15:11.560]   You can get them at the drug store and that's, and that is nice.
[00:15:11.560 --> 00:15:15.720]   Some of these other tracking devices, you throw them out when the battery dies.
[00:15:15.720 --> 00:15:17.680]   That's dopey.
[00:15:17.680 --> 00:15:20.000]   That's just dopey.
[00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:24.080]   Let's see, you can have eyes I mentioned, you can have the logo or whatever printed on there
[00:15:24.080 --> 00:15:29.960]   with UV LED printing or a laser engraved message like return or pet info.
[00:15:29.960 --> 00:15:35.480]   And when you lose your device, you're going to take advantage of tracker's massive, largest
[00:15:35.480 --> 00:15:37.120]   crowd GPS network.
[00:15:37.120 --> 00:15:38.120]   Scroll back a little bit, Brian.
[00:15:38.120 --> 00:15:42.120]   Let me see how big that is now because they, that, in fact, if you zoom out, you can see
[00:15:42.120 --> 00:15:47.320]   the whole globe, even if you leave your keys behind in London.
[00:15:47.320 --> 00:15:51.960]   And then somebody puts it on a plated Beijing, you'll still get alert on your phone when
[00:15:51.960 --> 00:15:54.480]   anybody who uses the tracker wanders by.
[00:15:54.480 --> 00:15:59.240]   And that means all of those places where you see dots all over the world, that's where
[00:15:59.240 --> 00:16:01.800]   your stuff will appear.
[00:16:01.800 --> 00:16:04.040]   A map of where your stuff is.
[00:16:04.040 --> 00:16:05.320]   Go to the tracker.com.
[00:16:05.320 --> 00:16:07.560]   Never lose your possessions again.
[00:16:07.560 --> 00:16:10.800]   Plus, just for our audience, if you enter the promo code MAC break, you're going to get
[00:16:10.800 --> 00:16:13.280]   a free tracker bravo with your order.
[00:16:13.280 --> 00:16:19.360]   Go to the tracker.com, T H E T R A C K R dot com.
[00:16:19.360 --> 00:16:24.440]   Buy a few trackers, get them engraved if you want, get them printed if you want.
[00:16:24.440 --> 00:16:27.960]   And then don't forget to add the promo code MAC break to your order and get an extra one
[00:16:27.960 --> 00:16:29.840]   free.
[00:16:29.840 --> 00:16:33.240]   The tracker.com promo code MAC break.
[00:16:33.240 --> 00:16:35.160]   All right.
[00:16:35.160 --> 00:16:39.120]   I've, I've given Andy enough time to reboot.
[00:16:39.120 --> 00:16:44.080]   I've given Renee enough time to put his boots on.
[00:16:44.080 --> 00:16:47.000]   And now we are ready to continue on with Mac break weekly.
[00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:49.040]   So let's see if it worked, Andy.
[00:16:49.040 --> 00:16:51.640]   Ah, you sound so good.
[00:16:51.640 --> 00:16:53.600]   Look at clover.
[00:16:53.600 --> 00:16:57.720]   I'm realizing that the only way to test this is for me to say nothing when you say
[00:16:57.720 --> 00:16:58.720]   nothing.
[00:16:58.720 --> 00:17:00.160]   It worked really well.
[00:17:00.160 --> 00:17:01.160]   That's awesome.
[00:17:01.160 --> 00:17:02.160]   I learned.
[00:17:02.160 --> 00:17:03.160]   Yay.
[00:17:03.160 --> 00:17:04.640]   The fixes in as they say.
[00:17:04.640 --> 00:17:12.720]   All right, Renee also had the chance to do a little digging new Mac OS coming.
[00:17:12.720 --> 00:17:15.600]   Well, actually iOS that's coming 10.3.
[00:17:15.600 --> 00:17:17.920]   That's just in beta now.
[00:17:17.920 --> 00:17:18.920]   What is it?
[00:17:18.920 --> 00:17:19.920]   Beta five, beta four.
[00:17:19.920 --> 00:17:22.600]   Oh, he's muted.
[00:17:22.600 --> 00:17:26.640]   Unmute 10.3 beta one beta one.
[00:17:26.640 --> 00:17:27.640]   Oh, it's the first.
[00:17:27.640 --> 00:17:28.640]   Okay.
[00:17:28.640 --> 00:17:29.640]   They're warning you.
[00:17:29.640 --> 00:17:30.640]   I just installed it.
[00:17:30.640 --> 00:17:32.800]   So now it's APFS God darn it.
[00:17:32.800 --> 00:17:33.800]   Gosh.
[00:17:33.800 --> 00:17:35.680]   Well, I'll do you inside zigity.
[00:17:35.680 --> 00:17:36.680]   Zoom.
[00:17:36.680 --> 00:17:37.680]   Yeah, you won't notice it.
[00:17:37.680 --> 00:17:38.680]   I don't know iOS.
[00:17:38.680 --> 00:17:42.120]   I forgot that they said they're going to put it on everything.
[00:17:42.120 --> 00:17:43.880]   So first, what is APFS?
[00:17:43.880 --> 00:17:44.880]   Apple.
[00:17:44.880 --> 00:17:45.880]   File.
[00:17:45.880 --> 00:17:46.880]   Apple file system.
[00:17:46.880 --> 00:17:47.880]   Yeah.
[00:17:47.880 --> 00:17:48.880]   So it's Apple's new file system.
[00:17:48.880 --> 00:17:49.880]   It's we've been rumors about this for years.
[00:17:49.880 --> 00:17:51.880]   There was some talk of them adapting.
[00:17:51.880 --> 00:17:56.600]   Um, sons system CFS yet because there's a whole bunch of advantages to it, but that
[00:17:56.600 --> 00:17:58.440]   no one that didn't work out for a variety of reasons.
[00:17:58.440 --> 00:18:03.680]   CFS is what's called a cow file system, which is, I think, copy on
[00:18:03.680 --> 00:18:04.840]   right is what it stands for.
[00:18:04.840 --> 00:18:10.040]   But the basic benefits of these Apple's file systems 30 years old, HFS is 30 years
[00:18:10.040 --> 00:18:14.680]   old, the basic benefit of these newer file systems, Windows doesn't have it.
[00:18:14.680 --> 00:18:16.920]   Apple doesn't have it yet.
[00:18:16.920 --> 00:18:20.760]   But you could put it on and even Linux, most of the time you don't use it, you might use
[00:18:20.760 --> 00:18:26.880]   a cow file system if you use BTRFS or if you use EFS and some Linux is let you do that
[00:18:26.880 --> 00:18:28.840]   is it'll take snapshots.
[00:18:28.840 --> 00:18:30.400]   It's big on data integrity.
[00:18:30.400 --> 00:18:36.120]   It actually looks at every byte of data and does a hash on it to make sure that there's
[00:18:36.120 --> 00:18:37.400]   no change.
[00:18:37.400 --> 00:18:42.240]   So you can kind of guarantee that your data is intact on the hard drive.
[00:18:42.240 --> 00:18:44.800]   It allows you to do great recovery stuff.
[00:18:44.800 --> 00:18:46.760]   It's just it's for data integrity.
[00:18:46.760 --> 00:18:47.760]   It's fantastic.
[00:18:47.760 --> 00:18:48.760]   There's a clone.
[00:18:48.760 --> 00:18:49.760]   And like you said, snapshotting.
[00:18:49.760 --> 00:18:53.080]   There's just all sorts of really, really handy things that just make data integrity and
[00:18:53.080 --> 00:18:56.480]   data preservation higher priorities than they were on the original file systems.
[00:18:56.480 --> 00:19:00.360]   And we just we need to kind of join the 21st century.
[00:19:00.360 --> 00:19:02.920]   Well, it's also a flash storage.
[00:19:02.920 --> 00:19:04.080]   The size of drive school.
[00:19:04.080 --> 00:19:10.880]   So we every system has to be tricked to access a terabyte hard drive because the geometry
[00:19:10.880 --> 00:19:12.880]   is they just have to lie to it.
[00:19:12.880 --> 00:19:16.040]   The controller says, yeah, I have a thousand twenty four cylinders.
[00:19:16.040 --> 00:19:17.800]   Yeah, sure.
[00:19:17.800 --> 00:19:18.960]   So that's one problem.
[00:19:18.960 --> 00:19:23.280]   And now we have SSDs and they really don't behave the same way as spinning drives.
[00:19:23.280 --> 00:19:24.800]   Encryption is built in.
[00:19:24.800 --> 00:19:30.720]   I mean, I guess that's we've had encryption, but even better encryption, metadata so that
[00:19:30.720 --> 00:19:33.760]   if during if the power goes out, that's what copy on right does.
[00:19:33.760 --> 00:19:38.960]   If the power goes out during a right, doesn't matter, better than journaling.
[00:19:38.960 --> 00:19:44.920]   This is like journaling plus directory sizing is fast.
[00:19:44.920 --> 00:19:47.120]   It's just a big it's a big improvement.
[00:19:47.120 --> 00:19:52.160]   Yeah, the underlying thing is that all this is stuff that you get for free by virtue of
[00:19:52.160 --> 00:19:56.960]   the fact that you're running this file system as opposed to, okay, let's have clever
[00:19:56.960 --> 00:20:00.480]   engineers implement these features on top of the existing file system.
[00:20:00.480 --> 00:20:02.680]   It's really it's it's baked right in.
[00:20:02.680 --> 00:20:07.520]   And that means that not only is it not not only is it going to be more reliable and also
[00:20:07.520 --> 00:20:12.280]   more accessible to more apps, but also if something God forbid does go wrong, it's easier to diagnose
[00:20:12.280 --> 00:20:13.280]   and fix.
[00:20:13.280 --> 00:20:16.200]   So this is just a big win from start to finish in long delayed.
[00:20:16.200 --> 00:20:17.200]   It is designed for SSDs.
[00:20:17.200 --> 00:20:20.960]   So it kind of makes sense that you'd use it on iOS because all iOS devices are using
[00:20:20.960 --> 00:20:21.960]   SSDs.
[00:20:21.960 --> 00:20:24.520]   Yeah, also iOS is a much more controlled environment.
[00:20:24.520 --> 00:20:28.880]   And so they get Apple has an app has a better idea of how people how developers might screw
[00:20:28.880 --> 00:20:32.640]   things up by trying to be as clever as Apple's own engineers.
[00:20:32.640 --> 00:20:35.840]   So this is this is a really good way to let let's start off in the shallow end of the
[00:20:35.840 --> 00:20:40.280]   pool before we implemented worldwide on the Mac OS.
[00:20:40.280 --> 00:20:41.920]   It also is easy to see target.
[00:20:41.920 --> 00:20:46.120]   It supports trim natively and does it all the time.
[00:20:46.120 --> 00:20:50.760]   So when you delete a file or you reclaim your reclaim free space, it trims immediately,
[00:20:50.760 --> 00:20:52.600]   which speeds up the SSD considerably.
[00:20:52.600 --> 00:20:57.280]   And there's also a theoretical advantages even on iOS where things like backups, the
[00:20:57.280 --> 00:21:01.080]   way backups are handled, the way cloud backups are handled, you can do incremental backups.
[00:21:01.080 --> 00:21:04.480]   I mean, there's just this significant advantages to switch into this file system, even on something
[00:21:04.480 --> 00:21:07.760]   like the Apple Watch, which is why I think they're going from their smallest device all
[00:21:07.760 --> 00:21:09.040]   the way up to their biggest.
[00:21:09.040 --> 00:21:11.920]   So they told us at WWDC that this was coming.
[00:21:11.920 --> 00:21:12.920]   Yes.
[00:21:12.920 --> 00:21:14.240]   I just I'm surprised it's coming.
[00:21:14.240 --> 00:21:17.960]   I just really didn't think that just always coming, but never quite a right.
[00:21:17.960 --> 00:21:20.800]   Yeah, I just thought it was going to be another one of those promises.
[00:21:20.800 --> 00:21:21.800]   And it's not Apple.
[00:21:21.800 --> 00:21:26.160]   I mean, every every company's done this, you know, Apple teased this was EFS a couple
[00:21:26.160 --> 00:21:27.400]   of years ago, maybe Apple.
[00:21:27.400 --> 00:21:29.280]   Or storage, other teas.
[00:21:29.280 --> 00:21:30.280]   Yeah.
[00:21:30.280 --> 00:21:31.960]   So it's better for bigger drives.
[00:21:31.960 --> 00:21:37.920]   You got snapshots, which is really a valuable backups, much more efficient.
[00:21:37.920 --> 00:21:39.480]   Here's this kind of interesting one.
[00:21:39.480 --> 00:21:43.560]   Space sharing allows multiple file systems to share the same underlying free space on
[00:21:43.560 --> 00:21:47.680]   a physical volume, which I guess would only be valuable.
[00:21:47.680 --> 00:21:53.040]   If you're using a virtual machine or I don't know, I don't know what's I don't know exactly
[00:21:53.040 --> 00:21:56.280]   how that would be used.
[00:21:56.280 --> 00:21:58.560]   This is really really great.
[00:21:58.560 --> 00:22:01.800]   I'm just thrilled to see this coming.
[00:22:01.800 --> 00:22:03.520]   Yeah, protection, sparse files.
[00:22:03.520 --> 00:22:04.520]   So you did it.
[00:22:04.520 --> 00:22:06.000]   Is your is your phone okay?
[00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:07.480]   Yeah, phone is fine.
[00:22:07.480 --> 00:22:11.560]   I mean, like I feel like you like, you know, we have to take the punch first just in case
[00:22:11.560 --> 00:22:14.080]   because you can warn people if there's a problem or you can reassure them if there's
[00:22:14.080 --> 00:22:15.080]   not.
[00:22:15.080 --> 00:22:16.080]   Yeah.
[00:22:16.080 --> 00:22:17.400]   Well, but yeah, it's working fine.
[00:22:17.400 --> 00:22:22.280]   Well, in this case, I'm not doing it because you're taking the punch.
[00:22:22.280 --> 00:22:23.280]   Yes.
[00:22:23.280 --> 00:22:25.360]   So you're taking the punch for me too.
[00:22:25.360 --> 00:22:26.360]   Yeah.
[00:22:26.360 --> 00:22:31.560]   So and again, like this is a way more targeted, way more controlled way fewer variable environment
[00:22:31.560 --> 00:22:32.560]   to test it on.
[00:22:32.560 --> 00:22:33.560]   It's something like a Mac.
[00:22:33.560 --> 00:22:34.560]   People can do all sorts of things.
[00:22:34.560 --> 00:22:39.920]   When they when they announced this, they had all these, you know, big like warnings in
[00:22:39.920 --> 00:22:43.680]   F at WWDC because you because developers have been able to, you know, provisionally do
[00:22:43.680 --> 00:22:51.600]   this on their Macs since June that, you know, all sorts of, you know, don't do this.
[00:22:51.600 --> 00:22:52.600]   Don't do that.
[00:22:52.600 --> 00:22:53.600]   Make sure you back up.
[00:22:53.600 --> 00:22:54.600]   It can't it won't work with this.
[00:22:54.600 --> 00:23:00.120]   It doesn't work with the Apple file, you know, the AFP.
[00:23:00.120 --> 00:23:06.360]   So and they said 2017 as a bootle file, bootle file system on the Mac OS.
[00:23:06.360 --> 00:23:10.600]   Then does the new Mac OS beta have it?
[00:23:10.600 --> 00:23:15.320]   I can't tell because it's not in the notes and I wasn't able to install it because I'm
[00:23:15.320 --> 00:23:16.320]   using it.
[00:23:16.320 --> 00:23:17.320]   Right.
[00:23:17.320 --> 00:23:18.320]   It would be in the, they would make a deal out of it.
[00:23:18.320 --> 00:23:19.320]   If it, if it did, I would.
[00:23:19.320 --> 00:23:20.320]   Yeah.
[00:23:20.320 --> 00:23:21.320]   I think you'd see warnings all over the place.
[00:23:21.320 --> 00:23:22.320]   Yeah.
[00:23:22.320 --> 00:23:23.840]   Like this is, this is going to be hard.
[00:23:23.840 --> 00:23:27.200]   And I would actually prefer them to test it on something like before they roll it out.
[00:23:27.200 --> 00:23:33.440]   At WWDC, they promised non destructive upgrades from HFS plus to APFS for all boot volumes when
[00:23:33.440 --> 00:23:34.440]   it ships.
[00:23:34.440 --> 00:23:35.440]   Yeah.
[00:23:35.440 --> 00:23:43.080]   So and if you want to go back, you have to format reform at the heart drive, which will
[00:23:43.080 --> 00:23:44.080]   erase all your data.
[00:23:44.080 --> 00:23:47.160]   But this is like the kind of cool thing that we've been talking about for years and that
[00:23:47.160 --> 00:23:48.480]   there is no obvious next.
[00:23:48.480 --> 00:23:52.760]   Like Apple, Apple can't get stuck again because there's no magical operating system and founder
[00:23:52.760 --> 00:23:53.760]   to go and get back.
[00:23:53.760 --> 00:23:56.680]   They have to move their technology stack forward.
[00:23:56.680 --> 00:24:00.640]   And even though they're keeping OS 10 and iOS very different, sorry, Mac OS and iOS very
[00:24:00.640 --> 00:24:04.160]   different on the interface level, there's a whole swath of technology that both of them
[00:24:04.160 --> 00:24:06.360]   already share and they can make that technology better.
[00:24:06.360 --> 00:24:10.880]   So whether it's Swift or as Apple file system, they can work on these giant projects and
[00:24:10.880 --> 00:24:16.520]   roll them out at a multi platform scale and really start to because HFS plus, like you
[00:24:16.520 --> 00:24:22.480]   said, it was, it was like the MacGyver level of gum and toothpicks holding it together.
[00:24:22.480 --> 00:24:26.200]   And this really helps them push forward again for another decade.
[00:24:26.200 --> 00:24:34.440]   One thing missing that's in ZFS is kind of native low level raid capabilities.
[00:24:34.440 --> 00:24:41.680]   One of the reasons I love ZFS is you can easily add a volume and turn on raid.
[00:24:41.680 --> 00:24:49.560]   Apple says there's no file raid built into APFS, but you can use Apple's own raid with
[00:24:49.560 --> 00:24:50.560]   it.
[00:24:50.560 --> 00:24:56.160]   So that's just something that's something that's a little different from ZFS.
[00:24:56.160 --> 00:25:00.040]   This is all, you know, really good news and something to look forward to.
[00:25:00.040 --> 00:25:06.160]   But so let us know how it goes on the early days.
[00:25:06.160 --> 00:25:07.280]   Good luck to you.
[00:25:07.280 --> 00:25:11.120]   And I hope you and the guys are all back.
[00:25:11.120 --> 00:25:13.120]   Yeah, really.
[00:25:13.120 --> 00:25:16.280]   Who knows what's going to happen.
[00:25:16.280 --> 00:25:19.920]   What else in the new Mac OS Sierra update?
[00:25:19.920 --> 00:25:23.520]   Now we got a beta, but we also got a regular update 10.12.3.
[00:25:23.520 --> 00:25:27.400]   Yeah, I mean, that was the bug fixes and security patches and performance.
[00:25:27.400 --> 00:25:28.400]   Just like the iOS.
[00:25:28.400 --> 00:25:29.400]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:25:29.400 --> 00:25:36.800]   Although if you have a MacBook Pro with Touch Bar, there are some specific fixes for that,
[00:25:36.800 --> 00:25:37.800]   right?
[00:25:37.800 --> 00:25:38.800]   Yeah.
[00:25:38.800 --> 00:25:40.440]   And so they're always speaking the graphics cards.
[00:25:40.440 --> 00:25:42.760]   Yeah, I'm guessing it's good.
[00:25:42.760 --> 00:25:44.360]   They're working on that still.
[00:25:44.360 --> 00:25:47.600]   If you have a new MacBook Pro, automatic graphics switching is better.
[00:25:47.600 --> 00:25:52.480]   Resolve graphics issues, which I hadn't seen when using Premiere Pro projects on the
[00:25:52.480 --> 00:25:54.080]   Mac Pro with Touch Bar.
[00:25:54.080 --> 00:25:56.760]   Oh, and remember when Adam Engst was on?
[00:25:56.760 --> 00:25:57.760]   Yeah.
[00:25:57.760 --> 00:26:03.560]   He was really complaining about the preview program, PDF handling on the Mac.
[00:26:03.560 --> 00:26:04.640]   Sounds like I was reading Adam.
[00:26:04.640 --> 00:26:08.800]   I went immediately to see what Adam said about the new Sierra.
[00:26:08.800 --> 00:26:14.440]   And he says fixes that one bad bug were adding a layer deleted everything below it.
[00:26:14.440 --> 00:26:16.200]   But there's other cosmetic bugs.
[00:26:16.200 --> 00:26:20.200]   There's still issues in other words.
[00:26:20.200 --> 00:26:21.760]   Still not fixed completely.
[00:26:21.760 --> 00:26:25.080]   But some fixes on the PDF and preview.
[00:26:25.080 --> 00:26:33.000]   Let me actually just load this so I can read you from his...
[00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:37.520]   Where does he talk about preview?
[00:26:37.520 --> 00:26:43.400]   Oh, Michael Sy of C command says he's still seeing previously reported user interface
[00:26:43.400 --> 00:26:47.360]   and rendering bugs in preview.
[00:26:47.360 --> 00:26:54.320]   But those aren't...that's not as bad as deleting data.
[00:26:54.320 --> 00:26:55.320]   It'll losses a show stop.
[00:26:55.320 --> 00:26:58.560]   Yeah, it would delete OCR text layers when editing.
[00:26:58.560 --> 00:26:59.560]   That's a bad one.
[00:26:59.560 --> 00:27:02.880]   But that is fixed.
[00:27:02.880 --> 00:27:04.320]   Thank God.
[00:27:04.320 --> 00:27:05.320]   Okay.
[00:27:05.320 --> 00:27:07.960]   1.05 gigabyte update.
[00:27:07.960 --> 00:27:10.680]   You have to do it via software update only at this point.
[00:27:10.680 --> 00:27:12.040]   As usual, it's brand new.
[00:27:12.040 --> 00:27:14.680]   They don't have a standalone download yet.
[00:27:14.680 --> 00:27:21.560]   And if you have PDF issues, Adams, tidbits, folks say get it right away.
[00:27:21.560 --> 00:27:27.560]   But otherwise, it's interesting that their advice has changed a little bit over time.
[00:27:27.560 --> 00:27:31.960]   And they now consistently say do not do the updates right away.
[00:27:31.960 --> 00:27:33.120]   Wait and see if anybody's screaming.
[00:27:33.120 --> 00:27:35.840]   I guess Apple's had a couple of bad updates.
[00:27:35.840 --> 00:27:37.360]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:27:37.360 --> 00:27:40.680]   It puts people in a real conundrum because once a security fixes release, people can
[00:27:40.680 --> 00:27:44.840]   start reverse engineering it and targeting people who don't apply the security update.
[00:27:44.840 --> 00:27:48.040]   But at the same time, if you apply it immediately and there's a bug in it, then you hurt yourself.
[00:27:48.040 --> 00:27:54.440]   So it's actually gotten a little bit worse for end users in the modern system.
[00:27:54.440 --> 00:27:59.320]   Well, not only that, but I think that there's the effects of applying an update right away.
[00:27:59.320 --> 00:28:01.680]   There's a lot more to consider.
[00:28:01.680 --> 00:28:05.000]   Actually, a good friend of mine just bought a brand new iMac.
[00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:10.200]   The reason why is because he applied an automatic update that suddenly said that he
[00:28:10.200 --> 00:28:13.400]   wasn't, he had an older iMac that was working just fine for him.
[00:28:13.400 --> 00:28:17.840]   He got an iPhone 6S last year or something.
[00:28:17.840 --> 00:28:23.360]   And then there was just a division where an update to iTunes or something was compatible
[00:28:23.360 --> 00:28:27.720]   with his new phone, but not compatible with his old Mac, which put him in the position
[00:28:27.720 --> 00:28:32.320]   where he could not, he could not, his iMac could not see his new phone, could not sync
[00:28:32.320 --> 00:28:35.800]   with his new phone, could not do anything with his new phone.
[00:28:35.800 --> 00:28:40.000]   And as a result, he would have been perfectly happy with the old version of iTunes.
[00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:45.280]   But to be fair, so his arm got completely twisted around and he's furious about having
[00:28:45.280 --> 00:28:50.800]   to buy a new iMac, but he's bought a computer that he didn't feel as though he needed.
[00:28:50.800 --> 00:28:54.000]   And he's going to get a lot of benefits of using an absolutely modern version of the
[00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:55.000]   OS.
[00:28:55.000 --> 00:29:00.880]   But that's just an example of, I always make sure that I take a look at the release notes
[00:29:00.880 --> 00:29:05.680]   to see what's now not compatible and just to make sure there isn't a hidden downside
[00:29:05.680 --> 00:29:08.680]   in this update that I don't want to have to deal with.
[00:29:08.680 --> 00:29:10.400]   Why do we think new iMacs will come out?
[00:29:10.400 --> 00:29:11.560]   They should come out this spring, right?
[00:29:11.560 --> 00:29:12.560]   I would think.
[00:29:12.560 --> 00:29:16.720]   Yeah, so I mean, they're, they're, they're really, so immediately, let me back up for
[00:29:16.720 --> 00:29:20.360]   a second, the minute Intel releases new chipsets, we immediately get winds apple updating,
[00:29:20.360 --> 00:29:21.400]   blah, blah, blah.
[00:29:21.400 --> 00:29:26.040]   So Intel has announced the current ones are on Skylake for the 27 inch and the previous
[00:29:26.040 --> 00:29:31.320]   generation Broadwell, I think it was for the 21 inch because Intel never made a version
[00:29:31.320 --> 00:29:33.120]   of Skylake for the 21.5 inch.
[00:29:33.120 --> 00:29:34.560]   So we'll see what happens this year.
[00:29:34.560 --> 00:29:37.040]   But Intel announced Kaby Lake, so immediately it's like, where's the max?
[00:29:37.040 --> 00:29:39.320]   What happens is Intel announces a new chipset.
[00:29:39.320 --> 00:29:43.200]   They have to make the specific chips that fit, whether it's a MacBook MacBook Pro or an iMac.
[00:29:43.200 --> 00:29:47.480]   And then once Apple gets them, they work with Intel for a period of time, depending on how
[00:29:47.480 --> 00:29:50.880]   much confidence there is in that chipset to get stuff like sleep and power nap and all
[00:29:50.880 --> 00:29:52.280]   that working effectively.
[00:29:52.280 --> 00:29:55.360]   So spring is probably the reasonable target for those.
[00:29:55.360 --> 00:29:59.640]   But as we saw with the MacBook Pros that that deadline can move depending on the chipset
[00:29:59.640 --> 00:30:02.640]   that one of the arrives.
[00:30:02.640 --> 00:30:08.360]   And I presume that we're also going to get new iPads.
[00:30:08.360 --> 00:30:11.680]   You think they'll be a spring event with new iPads as well?
[00:30:11.680 --> 00:30:15.640]   And maybe, I mean, iPads will come out this year, whether it's spring or not, depends
[00:30:15.640 --> 00:30:19.920]   on many factors, including the yield rates, some of the new stuff they're doing.
[00:30:19.920 --> 00:30:22.440]   I think they're hoping for spring.
[00:30:22.440 --> 00:30:26.440]   It's a particularly the direction in which they're taking the iPads now, where they're
[00:30:26.440 --> 00:30:28.680]   not going for lifestyle users.
[00:30:28.680 --> 00:30:33.240]   They're going for people who have five or six or seven hundred dollars to spend on a super
[00:30:33.240 --> 00:30:37.480]   ultra light, ultra compact, and basically convincing people that look, you can get a
[00:30:37.480 --> 00:30:42.160]   much more interesting machine if you break off the screen from the keyboard and give
[00:30:42.160 --> 00:30:45.240]   us five or six or seven hundred dollars for an iPad instead of a notebook.
[00:30:45.240 --> 00:30:51.520]   And that's traditionally a springtime early summer sort of consumer as opposed to a September
[00:30:51.520 --> 00:30:52.520]   October user.
[00:30:52.520 --> 00:30:58.560]   And it's been a year since the 9.7 was introduced in a year and a half since the 12.9 was introduced.
[00:30:58.560 --> 00:31:02.360]   So spring would be ideal, but just dealing with components lately, they could, they could
[00:31:02.360 --> 00:31:03.360]   easily slip.
[00:31:03.360 --> 00:31:04.360]   We talk.
[00:31:04.360 --> 00:31:05.360]   Yeah.
[00:31:05.360 --> 00:31:08.360]   It's just going to be interesting to see if they introduce a new screen size.
[00:31:08.360 --> 00:31:12.240]   I think they're going to have a battle between 9.7 and something just a little bit larger
[00:31:12.240 --> 00:31:17.880]   than that because they've, I've, I've seen some data on the sales of the 12.9 inch
[00:31:17.880 --> 00:31:20.160]   iPad that are really interesting.
[00:31:20.160 --> 00:31:22.960]   There are a lot of people who are coming around to the idea that they can have a serious
[00:31:22.960 --> 00:31:29.280]   computer and really what they want is a large screen as opposed to better apps or better
[00:31:29.280 --> 00:31:30.720]   app switching or things like that.
[00:31:30.720 --> 00:31:32.560]   They really associate that kind of real estate.
[00:31:32.560 --> 00:31:38.280]   So Apple might be reconsidering whether the 9.7 is actually the butter zone for a mid-range
[00:31:38.280 --> 00:31:40.440]   machine and decide let's make that a little bit bigger.
[00:31:40.440 --> 00:31:44.080]   And then based on that, they might even decide a year or two after that that, okay, 12.9,
[00:31:44.080 --> 00:31:48.120]   we're going to get rid of that because the 12.9 is going to be the, to not to be the 15
[00:31:48.120 --> 00:31:55.000]   inch, the 15 inch or the 17 inch MacBook of the line that gets rid of that too.
[00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:59.560]   So it's going to be, there's a lot of, it's iPad is still really exciting because it's
[00:31:59.560 --> 00:32:01.200]   still very, very fluid.
[00:32:01.200 --> 00:32:04.520]   People walk into the store not, that's not what the preconceived idea of what hardware
[00:32:04.520 --> 00:32:06.040]   they absolutely want.
[00:32:06.040 --> 00:32:09.720]   So Apple and other companies are free to really roll the dice and decide, well, what
[00:32:09.720 --> 00:32:11.720]   if we decided to add this feature?
[00:32:11.720 --> 00:32:14.440]   What if we decided to delete this port?
[00:32:14.440 --> 00:32:15.440]   I love this.
[00:32:15.440 --> 00:32:16.440]   I love this rumor.
[00:32:16.440 --> 00:32:22.880]   And it's been going around since last November, but now Dan Provost did some calculations.
[00:32:22.880 --> 00:32:29.240]   We talked about this yesterday on iOS today with Jason Snell that make the 10.5 inch iPad
[00:32:29.240 --> 00:32:32.840]   Pro make a little bit of sense.
[00:32:32.840 --> 00:32:35.920]   So here's the, here's the idea.
[00:32:35.920 --> 00:32:38.240]   As you know, we've got really three sizes.
[00:32:38.240 --> 00:32:42.160]   We've got the iPad Pro 12.9 and 9.7.
[00:32:42.160 --> 00:32:44.800]   We also have an iPad mini.
[00:32:44.800 --> 00:32:54.400]   The iPad Pro 12.9 was the resolution wise, the equivalent of two iPad airs side by side
[00:32:54.400 --> 00:32:56.960]   in portrait mode, right?
[00:32:56.960 --> 00:32:58.400]   And so Dan Provost did some math.
[00:32:58.400 --> 00:33:04.120]   He said, you know what, on 10, if you were going to take two iPad minis and put them side
[00:33:04.120 --> 00:33:14.200]   by side with this, you could do a 10.5 inch iPad that resolution wise would be the same
[00:33:14.200 --> 00:33:18.640]   as the 9.7 inch iPad.
[00:33:18.640 --> 00:33:20.080]   I think, am I saying this right?
[00:33:20.080 --> 00:33:21.440]   Yeah, no, you totally are.
[00:33:21.440 --> 00:33:25.280]   So I don't want to discount that because, you know, there is a lot of convenience that
[00:33:25.280 --> 00:33:26.280]   leads to that math.
[00:33:26.280 --> 00:33:30.200]   For example, if you're cutting panels at a 326 DPI, it makes sense to just keep cutting
[00:33:30.200 --> 00:33:35.600]   those panels and not have arbitrary pixel densities because that's much harder to manufacture.
[00:33:35.600 --> 00:33:39.160]   But at the same time, a lot of things that might seem pre-planned are just expediency.
[00:33:39.160 --> 00:33:43.200]   Like when the iPad mini was announced, there was this moment in Apple where they're like,
[00:33:43.200 --> 00:33:47.040]   oh, thank God, the interface still works at this size because we have no time to redo
[00:33:47.040 --> 00:33:48.040]   this.
[00:33:48.040 --> 00:33:50.800]   And it's just, you know, that sort of serendipitous event.
[00:33:50.800 --> 00:33:54.280]   And it's because they did a lot of smart choices leading up to that, but it's not because
[00:33:54.280 --> 00:33:58.400]   they sat down and planned three years ahead and said, this is what we want to aim for.
[00:33:58.400 --> 00:34:03.400]   But you do want to stay with those DPI so that developers don't have to go too crazy,
[00:34:03.400 --> 00:34:04.400]   right?
[00:34:04.400 --> 00:34:07.400]   They've attracted a lot of, no, they've attracted a lot of that away.
[00:34:07.400 --> 00:34:09.880]   But the way it's almost the same as what Andy was mentioning with the iPad, and that
[00:34:09.880 --> 00:34:13.040]   was initially Johnny Ives team had this great idea to make this like, if you go back to
[00:34:13.040 --> 00:34:17.280]   the early Samsung lawsuits and the prototype iPhones to make this beautiful little aluminum
[00:34:17.280 --> 00:34:21.640]   box and they got most of the way there with the iPhone 5 and the iPhone 6.
[00:34:21.640 --> 00:34:22.960]   And what comes after that?
[00:34:22.960 --> 00:34:25.880]   And the idea there is that the front should be glass.
[00:34:25.880 --> 00:34:28.960]   And Apple, we talked about this before, is that Apple never really goes for chipsets.
[00:34:28.960 --> 00:34:30.040]   They go for feature sets.
[00:34:30.040 --> 00:34:34.560]   So like if they're switching to OLED or they're going to make a panel that is mostly glass
[00:34:34.560 --> 00:34:37.800]   on the front, they're doing it because they want to create a certain product, not because
[00:34:37.800 --> 00:34:41.000]   they really necessarily are beholden to any display technology.
[00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:47.840]   So if you take an iPad Pro 9.7 and you imagine that that front is mostly glass, that will
[00:34:47.840 --> 00:34:50.400]   be the boundary box for the screen.
[00:34:50.400 --> 00:34:54.440]   And it's not because maybe that screen size is more useful, but if they just want to replace
[00:34:54.440 --> 00:34:58.160]   bezel with screen and do that in the iPhones and the iPads, that's the sort of device you
[00:34:58.160 --> 00:34:59.560]   start to get.
[00:34:59.560 --> 00:35:03.280]   The other thing that I, yeah, the bezel thing is actually to me more interesting than the
[00:35:03.280 --> 00:35:04.920]   resolution thing.
[00:35:04.920 --> 00:35:09.680]   And Dan points out, he cut out a 10.5 inch piece of paper.
[00:35:09.680 --> 00:35:16.120]   And he pointed out you could actually continue with the same size 9.7 inch iPad Pro, just
[00:35:16.120 --> 00:35:17.280]   reduce the bezel size.
[00:35:17.280 --> 00:35:20.120]   And you still even have ears to hold it.
[00:35:20.120 --> 00:35:26.040]   And that seems, I mean, this isn't this going to be the year that Apple shrinks bezel.
[00:35:26.040 --> 00:35:28.480]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:35:28.480 --> 00:35:32.920]   And even if people are scared about, I think it realized that's just a little mockup,
[00:35:32.920 --> 00:35:35.880]   but if people are scared about, but you're only going to have no place to hold it, realize
[00:35:35.880 --> 00:35:41.840]   that there's already a lot of software built into the iPad that tries to figure out that
[00:35:41.840 --> 00:35:46.320]   are you actually intending to press at the edge of the touch display?
[00:35:46.320 --> 00:35:47.960]   Or are you simply holding it that way?
[00:35:47.960 --> 00:35:52.360]   There is, there's a lot of logic that goes into simple touch rejection as much as touch
[00:35:52.360 --> 00:35:53.560]   acceptance.
[00:35:53.560 --> 00:35:56.160]   And this is something that's happening everywhere.
[00:35:56.160 --> 00:36:01.840]   If Apple decides to remove the, the active physical prominent home button from the front
[00:36:01.840 --> 00:36:05.200]   of the screen, I really do think it's going to be because they decide that we want to
[00:36:05.200 --> 00:36:09.680]   have as big a display and the smallest possible form factor rumor about the rumors about the
[00:36:09.680 --> 00:36:14.480]   next Samsung Galaxy eight is that they are going to remove the clicky button at the bottom
[00:36:14.480 --> 00:36:17.760]   of the screen while keeping the device pretty much the same size.
[00:36:17.760 --> 00:36:21.400]   And so the reason why they're removing the clicky button is to have an edge to edge display
[00:36:21.400 --> 00:36:26.080]   and basically give you something the size of like an iPhone seven, excuse me, it's screen
[00:36:26.080 --> 00:36:31.400]   display about the size of an iPhone seven plus in the size of an iPhone seven or some
[00:36:31.400 --> 00:36:36.720]   place closer to that, because there's a, there is some data saying that there's, if you were
[00:36:36.720 --> 00:36:42.440]   to graph people's resistance towards increasing phone sizes, people are really cool with it
[00:36:42.440 --> 00:36:47.920]   up until a certain point, at which point, even increasing the size of the device by
[00:36:47.920 --> 00:36:51.600]   a one quarter inch on one dimension is just a deal breaker.
[00:36:51.600 --> 00:36:55.200]   Even though it's a few millimeters, that's the thing that turns it from a phone that you
[00:36:55.200 --> 00:37:00.000]   can put in your pocket to a ping pong paddle that you need to, that you need to basically
[00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:02.880]   put into a case.
[00:37:02.880 --> 00:37:08.520]   So other Android devices, especially Google's devices, don't have physical buttons.
[00:37:08.520 --> 00:37:12.440]   And I actually didn't like this at first because I thought, well, you always know where the
[00:37:12.440 --> 00:37:14.280]   physical button is.
[00:37:14.280 --> 00:37:17.200]   So it's just that it's very natural.
[00:37:17.200 --> 00:37:22.720]   But I've gotten used to the idea of an on screen home button and Android does it quite well.
[00:37:22.720 --> 00:37:27.840]   I'm looking at Google Pixel, which has it built in and the advantage of that, which I consider
[00:37:27.840 --> 00:37:33.920]   to disadvantage is when you go in, you know, go from portrait mode to landscape mode,
[00:37:33.920 --> 00:37:39.560]   the button moves to a always kind of the bottom middle, which you can't do with the physical
[00:37:39.560 --> 00:37:40.560]   button.
[00:37:40.560 --> 00:37:41.560]   But for a while, I didn't like that idea.
[00:37:41.560 --> 00:37:43.360]   I liked the physical button.
[00:37:43.360 --> 00:37:47.760]   And it also means that you it also means that you can have an aspect ratio change where
[00:37:47.760 --> 00:37:49.640]   we want a wide screen film, right?
[00:37:49.640 --> 00:37:51.480]   You can actually reclaim some of that space.
[00:37:51.480 --> 00:37:54.760]   It's a different it's not the same thing with the with Apple because remember that with
[00:37:54.760 --> 00:37:59.320]   Android, you have to have three buttons at the bottom for just as basic consistent user
[00:37:59.320 --> 00:38:00.320]   interface.
[00:38:00.320 --> 00:38:04.680]   But it does show you how cool I'm a big fan of having a consistent home button in the
[00:38:04.680 --> 00:38:08.120]   middle there, particularly for people who can't physically see the screen.
[00:38:08.120 --> 00:38:12.000]   They really do need to find something tactile to orient themselves.
[00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:14.600]   But nonetheless, they could do a lot of Apple could do a lot of really interesting things
[00:38:14.600 --> 00:38:19.640]   that they simply said that we're not going to put anything that is a nobody has an absolute
[00:38:19.640 --> 00:38:22.320]   right to have this real estate on the front of the device.
[00:38:22.320 --> 00:38:24.480]   We're going to wipe off everything and just make it all pixels.
[00:38:24.480 --> 00:38:25.480]   It's not just Apple.
[00:38:25.480 --> 00:38:30.920]   I think this this 2017 is going to be the year that bezels on all devices shrink away.
[00:38:30.920 --> 00:38:33.880]   Even on that video, you were watching.
[00:38:33.880 --> 00:38:35.760]   We with Steve Jobs said you can't change the buttons.
[00:38:35.760 --> 00:38:38.680]   If you think of a great idea, you can't ship a new button, you can't change the button
[00:38:38.680 --> 00:38:40.480]   and that home button is still a button.
[00:38:40.480 --> 00:38:41.480]   Right.
[00:38:41.480 --> 00:38:45.520]   I mean, I'm seeing PCs, Dell's doing it and others are doing now that almost are full
[00:38:45.520 --> 00:38:47.200]   bleed edge to edge.
[00:38:47.200 --> 00:38:49.080]   And it really is a nice experience.
[00:38:49.080 --> 00:38:53.400]   But it also has this advantage of giving you a bigger screen on the same size device.
[00:38:53.400 --> 00:38:55.800]   And that's what everybody wants to do.
[00:38:55.800 --> 00:39:01.600]   These 13 inch Dell XPS laptops that have these edge to edge top to bottom displays.
[00:39:01.600 --> 00:39:07.000]   People can people I'm trying to remember if it is HP or another manufacturer.
[00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:09.280]   But sometimes some of these manufacturers get a little bit silly.
[00:39:09.280 --> 00:39:12.120]   They realize, oh, wait, we don't have a space for the webcam.
[00:39:12.120 --> 00:39:13.120]   That's OK.
[00:39:13.120 --> 00:39:14.120]   We'll put it at the bottom.
[00:39:14.120 --> 00:39:15.120]   That's what Dell did.
[00:39:15.120 --> 00:39:17.800]   It's an up the nose cam because it's the bottom left of the screen.
[00:39:17.800 --> 00:39:20.080]   So you're on Skype and you're, you know, you're right.
[00:39:20.080 --> 00:39:22.040]   They're looking up like this at you.
[00:39:22.040 --> 00:39:25.720]   So we'll just three, print like a periscope attachment to put it up where you need to
[00:39:25.720 --> 00:39:26.720]   go.
[00:39:26.720 --> 00:39:29.880]   So you do get these issues where you know, you have to accommodate physical hardware.
[00:39:29.880 --> 00:39:32.120]   And if you have no bezel, there's nowhere to put it.
[00:39:32.120 --> 00:39:35.960]   But it's, but it is super compelling, especially on a laptop where you're not, you're really
[00:39:35.960 --> 00:39:39.000]   aren't going to be touching the screen if you particularly with some Macintosh.
[00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:43.080]   And then when you see that I've got a 13 inch laptop that will fit into a common sized
[00:39:43.080 --> 00:39:47.320]   bag and it's just that little bit larger yikes.
[00:39:47.320 --> 00:39:53.320]   Remember that your vertical times horizontal so that even if you just save a few pixels
[00:39:53.320 --> 00:39:56.200]   on each axis, you actually have a really, really big effect.
[00:39:56.200 --> 00:39:57.840]   It's a huge bang for the buck feature.
[00:39:57.840 --> 00:40:02.400]   It is true that when you're holding a phone or a tablet, having no bezel makes it all.
[00:40:02.400 --> 00:40:07.640]   I mean, although I have to say, well, a real success story was that in almost every respect
[00:40:07.640 --> 00:40:14.440]   was a Galaxy Note 7 because it was the same size as an iPhone 7, but got a much bigger
[00:40:14.440 --> 00:40:17.800]   screen because they went edge to edge on the left and the right.
[00:40:17.800 --> 00:40:22.200]   And on the phone, it wasn't so bad because you can, I think Jason Snow was pointing to
[00:40:22.200 --> 00:40:27.240]   say you can hold it with one hand in a way that you don't need the ears, like, but on
[00:40:27.240 --> 00:40:29.640]   its tablet, you want some ears.
[00:40:29.640 --> 00:40:31.840]   Multitouch is actually a three dimensional technology.
[00:40:31.840 --> 00:40:33.400]   It radiates out from the screen.
[00:40:33.400 --> 00:40:37.360]   We are used to touching it, but it creates a field and different companies use that for
[00:40:37.360 --> 00:40:41.080]   different things like Nokia and Samsung have used that to do gloves or floating gestures
[00:40:41.080 --> 00:40:46.080]   or stuff.
[00:40:46.080 --> 00:40:46.080]   Apple uses that to map your hands so they can actually start telling which finger you're
[00:40:46.080 --> 00:40:50.040]   using out of all of them and start rejecting things that they believe are unintentional.
[00:40:50.040 --> 00:40:53.600]   And if you started strappling that smarts and they started doing that with the iPad Mini
[00:40:53.600 --> 00:40:56.680]   because it had smaller bezel, you started strappling that smarts and they have a really
[00:40:56.680 --> 00:40:59.560]   good idea about how you're holding in and what you're doing.
[00:40:59.560 --> 00:41:01.160]   I didn't know that.
[00:41:01.160 --> 00:41:02.160]   That's cool.
[00:41:02.160 --> 00:41:05.840]   I just thought, oh, well, they could see you drawing so any big schmutz that's your palm,
[00:41:05.840 --> 00:41:07.680]   they just go, well, that's not him.
[00:41:07.680 --> 00:41:10.160]   That, I mean, that too, but it is 3D mapped.
[00:41:10.160 --> 00:41:11.160]   It's cool.
[00:41:11.160 --> 00:41:12.880]   So they know you're, oh, he's using his forefinger.
[00:41:12.880 --> 00:41:17.160]   So we're going to ignore anything else because he's drawing fuzzy vision, but they have a
[00:41:17.160 --> 00:41:18.320]   general idea.
[00:41:18.320 --> 00:41:19.320]   That's really interesting.
[00:41:19.320 --> 00:41:20.320]   Yeah.
[00:41:20.320 --> 00:41:21.320]   It works quite well on the mini.
[00:41:21.320 --> 00:41:23.520]   I don't have any problem with the mini at all.
[00:41:23.520 --> 00:41:24.520]   Yeah.
[00:41:24.520 --> 00:41:28.440]   I really think that I wish that the people who work at Apple on these incredibly sophisticated
[00:41:28.440 --> 00:41:33.880]   and useful parts of the operating system and parts of the parts of the service, they,
[00:41:33.880 --> 00:41:39.320]   no one really sees how, no one really sees how good their work is.
[00:41:39.320 --> 00:41:43.680]   Like when you're typing on a keyboard, you don't, the phone doesn't tell you that, oh,
[00:41:43.680 --> 00:41:47.640]   well, you actually kind of hit that letter I a little bit too far to the left.
[00:41:47.640 --> 00:41:48.640]   But don't worry.
[00:41:48.640 --> 00:41:51.320]   I know that you meant to hit to type the letter I.
[00:41:51.320 --> 00:41:55.000]   That's so much work that goes into making sure that it doesn't, you're not cursing and
[00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:56.240]   throwing the phone.
[00:41:56.240 --> 00:42:00.640]   And again, palm rejection, press, touch rejection, that's such a sophisticated part of it.
[00:42:00.640 --> 00:42:04.320]   But you will never get, you will never get one of those engineers in front of a white
[00:42:04.320 --> 00:42:08.280]   screen talking about this technology because it's hard to explain.
[00:42:08.280 --> 00:42:13.880]   It's easy to explain like a tolerance of 0.11114 microns and rejection rate.
[00:42:13.880 --> 00:42:16.120]   It's hard to tell people how that works.
[00:42:16.120 --> 00:42:20.640]   But that they really are one of the, that whole group is one of the insan heroes of Apple
[00:42:20.640 --> 00:42:21.640]   engineering.
[00:42:21.640 --> 00:42:23.200]   Credit to his flight because he did it.
[00:42:23.200 --> 00:42:24.200]   Go ahead.
[00:42:24.200 --> 00:42:26.040]   I was going to give you a little pat on the back.
[00:42:26.040 --> 00:42:27.600]   So you go ahead and I'll do that.
[00:42:27.600 --> 00:42:28.600]   Okay, no, I'll go ahead.
[00:42:28.600 --> 00:42:32.960]   So really quickly, there was this test several years ago where a company used a vertical robot
[00:42:32.960 --> 00:42:37.840]   to test the sensitivity of capacitive screens and the iPhone failed and they did this big
[00:42:37.840 --> 00:42:38.840]   headline.
[00:42:38.840 --> 00:42:41.720]   iPhone is the worst capacitive touch device out of all the ones we tested.
[00:42:41.720 --> 00:42:44.480]   But it's because they were using the 3D technology and they could also pull a attack
[00:42:44.480 --> 00:42:45.480]   angle.
[00:42:45.480 --> 00:42:49.000]   Well, robots were coming straight down from the top, but humans don't type like that.
[00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:53.480]   They type out an angle and Apple was detecting the angle to sort of dynamically change the
[00:42:53.480 --> 00:42:56.840]   affordance of the area that you were trying to hit because further away is harder to hit
[00:42:56.840 --> 00:42:59.040]   and an increased angle for a human being.
[00:42:59.040 --> 00:43:01.960]   So all this stuff was being measured internally, but nobody knew that.
[00:43:01.960 --> 00:43:03.600]   So it was just robot tapping badly.
[00:43:03.600 --> 00:43:04.600]   Yeah.
[00:43:04.600 --> 00:43:05.600]   It was hilarious.
[00:43:05.600 --> 00:43:06.600]   Robots.
[00:43:06.600 --> 00:43:07.600]   Not a good way to test.
[00:43:07.600 --> 00:43:08.600]   But it was a very interesting thing.
[00:43:08.600 --> 00:43:09.600]   I think it was a very interesting thing.
[00:43:09.600 --> 00:43:10.600]   I think it was a very interesting thing.
[00:43:10.600 --> 00:43:11.600]   I think it was a very interesting thing.
[00:43:11.600 --> 00:43:12.600]   I think it was a very interesting thing.
[00:43:12.600 --> 00:43:13.600]   I think it was a very interesting thing.
[00:43:13.600 --> 00:43:14.600]   I think it was a very interesting thing.
[00:43:14.600 --> 00:43:15.600]   I think it was a very interesting thing.
[00:43:15.600 --> 00:43:16.600]   I think it was a very interesting thing.
[00:43:16.600 --> 00:43:17.600]   I think it was a very interesting thing.
[00:43:17.600 --> 00:43:18.600]   I think it was a very interesting thing.
[00:43:18.600 --> 00:43:19.600]   I think it was a very interesting thing.
[00:43:19.600 --> 00:43:20.600]   I think it was a very interesting thing.
[00:43:20.600 --> 00:43:21.600]   I think it was a very interesting thing.
[00:43:21.600 --> 00:43:22.600]   I think it was a very interesting thing.
[00:43:22.600 --> 00:43:23.600]   I think it was a very interesting thing.
[00:43:23.600 --> 00:43:24.600]   I think it was a very interesting thing.
[00:43:24.600 --> 00:43:25.600]   I think it was a very interesting thing.
[00:43:25.600 --> 00:43:26.600]   I think it was a very interesting thing.
[00:43:26.600 --> 00:43:27.600]   I think it was a very interesting thing.
[00:43:27.600 --> 00:43:34.600]   I think it was a very interesting thing.
[00:43:34.600 --> 00:43:35.600]   I think it was a very interesting thing.
[00:43:35.600 --> 00:43:36.600]   I think it was a very interesting thing.
[00:43:36.600 --> 00:43:37.600]   I think it was a very interesting thing.
[00:43:37.600 --> 00:43:38.600]   I think it was a very interesting thing.
[00:43:38.600 --> 00:43:39.600]   I think it was a very interesting thing.
[00:43:39.600 --> 00:43:40.600]   I think it was a very interesting thing.
[00:43:40.600 --> 00:43:41.600]   I think it was a very interesting thing.
[00:43:41.600 --> 00:43:42.600]   I think it was a very interesting thing.
[00:43:42.600 --> 00:43:43.600]   I think it was a very interesting thing.
[00:43:43.600 --> 00:43:44.600]   I think it was a very interesting thing.
[00:43:44.600 --> 00:43:45.600]   I think it was a very interesting thing.
[00:43:45.600 --> 00:43:46.600]   I think it was a very interesting thing.
[00:43:46.600 --> 00:43:47.600]   I think it was a very interesting thing.
[00:43:47.600 --> 00:43:48.600]   I think it was a very interesting thing.
[00:43:48.600 --> 00:43:49.600]   I think it was a very interesting thing.
[00:43:49.600 --> 00:43:50.600]   I think it was a very interesting thing.
[00:43:50.600 --> 00:43:51.600]   I think it was a very interesting thing.
[00:43:51.600 --> 00:43:52.600]   I think it was a very interesting thing.
[00:43:52.600 --> 00:43:53.600]   I think it was a very interesting thing.
[00:43:53.600 --> 00:43:54.600]   I think it was a very interesting thing.
[00:43:54.600 --> 00:43:55.600]   I think it was a very interesting thing.
[00:43:55.600 --> 00:43:56.600]   I think it was a very interesting thing.
[00:43:56.600 --> 00:43:57.600]   I think it was a very interesting thing.
[00:43:57.600 --> 00:43:58.600]   I think it was a very interesting thing.
[00:43:58.600 --> 00:43:59.600]   I think it was a very interesting thing.
[00:43:59.600 --> 00:44:00.600]   I think it was a very interesting thing.
[00:44:00.600 --> 00:44:01.600]   I think it was a very interesting thing.
[00:44:01.600 --> 00:44:02.600]   I think it was a very interesting thing.
[00:44:02.600 --> 00:44:03.600]   I think it was a very interesting thing.

[00:44:09.600 --> 00:44:10.600]   I think it was a very interesting thing.
[00:44:10.600 --> 00:44:11.600]   I think it was a very interesting thing.
[00:44:11.600 --> 00:44:12.600]   I think it was a very interesting thing.
[00:44:12.600 --> 00:44:13.600]   I think it was a very interesting thing.
[00:44:13.600 --> 00:44:14.600]   I think it was a very interesting thing.
[00:44:14.600 --> 00:44:15.600]   I think it was a very interesting thing.
[00:44:15.600 --> 00:44:16.600]   I think it was a very interesting thing.
[00:44:16.600 --> 00:44:17.600]   I think it was a very interesting thing.
[00:44:17.600 --> 00:44:18.600]   I think it was a very interesting thing.
[00:44:18.600 --> 00:44:19.600]   I think it was a very interesting thing.
[00:44:19.600 --> 00:44:20.600]   I think it was a very interesting thing.
[00:44:20.600 --> 00:44:21.600]   I think it was a very interesting thing.
[00:44:21.600 --> 00:44:22.600]   I think it was a very interesting thing.
[00:44:22.600 --> 00:44:23.600]   I think it was a very interesting thing.
[00:44:23.600 --> 00:44:24.600]   I think it was a very interesting thing.
[00:44:24.600 --> 00:44:25.600]   I think it was a very interesting thing.
[00:44:25.600 --> 00:44:26.600]   I think it was a very interesting thing.
[00:44:26.600 --> 00:44:27.600]   I think it was a very interesting thing.
[00:44:27.600 --> 00:44:28.600]   I think it was a very interesting thing.
[00:44:28.600 --> 00:44:29.600]   I think it was a very interesting thing.
[00:44:29.600 --> 00:44:30.600]   I think it was a very interesting thing.
[00:44:30.600 --> 00:44:31.600]   I think it was a very interesting thing.
[00:44:31.600 --> 00:44:32.600]   I think it was a very interesting thing.
[00:44:32.600 --> 00:44:33.600]   I think it was a very interesting thing.
[00:44:33.600 --> 00:44:34.600]   I think it was a very interesting thing.
[00:44:34.600 --> 00:44:35.600]   I think it was a very interesting thing.
[00:44:35.600 --> 00:44:36.600]   I think it was a very interesting thing.
[00:44:36.600 --> 00:44:37.600]   I think it was a very interesting thing.
[00:44:37.600 --> 00:44:38.600]   I think it was a very interesting thing.
[00:44:38.600 --> 00:44:39.600]   I think it was a very interesting thing.
[00:44:39.600 --> 00:44:40.600]   I think it was a very interesting thing.
[00:44:40.600 --> 00:44:41.600]   I think it was a very interesting thing.
[00:44:41.600 --> 00:44:42.600]   I think it was a very interesting thing.
[00:44:42.600 --> 00:44:43.600]   I think it was a very interesting thing.
[00:44:43.600 --> 00:44:44.600]   I think it was a very interesting thing.
[00:44:44.600 --> 00:44:45.600]   I think it was a very interesting thing.
[00:44:45.600 --> 00:44:46.600]   I think it was a very interesting thing.
[00:44:46.600 --> 00:44:47.600]   I think it was a very interesting thing.
[00:44:47.600 --> 00:44:48.600]   I think it was a very interesting thing.
[00:44:48.600 --> 00:44:49.600]   I think it was a very interesting thing.
[00:44:49.600 --> 00:44:50.600]   I think it was a very interesting thing.
[00:44:50.600 --> 00:44:51.600]   I think it was a very interesting thing.
[00:44:51.600 --> 00:44:52.600]   I think it was a very interesting thing.
[00:44:52.600 --> 00:44:53.600]   I think it was a very interesting thing.
[00:44:54.600 --> 00:44:55.600]   I think it was a very interesting thing.
[00:44:55.600 --> 00:44:56.600]   I think it was a very interesting thing.
[00:44:56.600 --> 00:44:57.600]   I think it was a very interesting thing.
[00:44:57.600 --> 00:44:58.600]   I think it was a very interesting thing.
[00:44:58.600 --> 00:44:59.600]   I think it was a very interesting thing.
[00:44:59.600 --> 00:45:00.600]   I think it was a very interesting thing.
[00:45:00.600 --> 00:45:01.600]   I think it was a very interesting thing.
[00:45:01.600 --> 00:45:02.600]   I think it was a very interesting thing.
[00:45:02.600 --> 00:45:03.600]   I think it was a very interesting thing.
[00:45:03.600 --> 00:45:04.600]   I think it was a very interesting thing.
[00:45:04.600 --> 00:45:05.600]   I think it was a very interesting thing.
[00:45:05.600 --> 00:45:06.600]   I think it was a very interesting thing.
[00:45:06.600 --> 00:45:07.600]   I think it was a very interesting thing.
[00:45:07.600 --> 00:45:08.600]   I think it was a very interesting thing.
[00:45:08.600 --> 00:45:09.600]   I think it was a very interesting thing.
[00:45:09.600 --> 00:45:10.600]   I think it was a very interesting thing.
[00:45:10.600 --> 00:45:11.600]   I think it was a very interesting thing.
[00:45:11.600 --> 00:45:12.600]   I think it was a very interesting thing.
[00:45:12.600 --> 00:45:13.600]   I think it was a very interesting thing.
[00:45:13.600 --> 00:45:14.600]   I think it was a very interesting thing.
[00:45:14.600 --> 00:45:15.600]   I think it was a very interesting thing.
[00:45:15.600 --> 00:45:16.600]   I think it was a very interesting thing.
[00:45:16.600 --> 00:45:17.600]   I think it was a very interesting thing.
[00:45:17.600 --> 00:45:18.600]   I think it was a very interesting thing.
[00:45:18.600 --> 00:45:19.600]   I think it was a very interesting thing.
[00:45:19.600 --> 00:45:20.600]   I think it was a very interesting thing.
[00:45:20.600 --> 00:45:21.600]   I think it was a very interesting thing.
[00:45:21.600 --> 00:45:22.600]   I think it was a very interesting thing.
[00:45:22.600 --> 00:45:23.600]   I think it was a very interesting thing.
[00:45:23.600 --> 00:45:24.600]   I think it was a very interesting thing.
[00:45:24.600 --> 00:45:25.600]   I think it was a very interesting thing.
[00:45:25.600 --> 00:45:26.600]   I think it was a very interesting thing.
[00:45:26.600 --> 00:45:27.600]   I think it was a very interesting thing.
[00:45:27.600 --> 00:45:28.600]   I think it was a very interesting thing.
[00:45:28.600 --> 00:45:29.600]   I think it was a very interesting thing.
[00:45:29.600 --> 00:45:30.600]   I think it was a very interesting thing.
[00:45:30.600 --> 00:45:31.600]   I think it was a very interesting thing.
[00:45:31.600 --> 00:45:32.600]   I think it was a very interesting thing.
[00:45:32.600 --> 00:45:33.600]   I think it was a very interesting thing.
[00:45:33.600 --> 00:45:34.600]   I think it was a very interesting thing.
[00:45:35.600 --> 00:45:38.600]   I think in the case of Guardians of Galaxy, it's a cassette tape, I would guess.
[00:45:38.600 --> 00:45:42.600]   He's making a nuclear device and he decides he needs some insulation tape.
[00:45:42.600 --> 00:45:43.600]   Oh, it's actually a...
[00:45:43.600 --> 00:45:48.600]   It was not terribly...
[00:45:48.600 --> 00:45:53.600]   I was not completely satisfied with Samsung's press conference.
[00:45:53.600 --> 00:45:57.600]   Only because I'm glad that they were able to find out here is exactly what went wrong.
[00:45:57.600 --> 00:45:59.600]   Here's how we know that this is exactly what wrong.
[00:45:59.600 --> 00:46:01.600]   Here's how we're going to prevent that from going wrong.
[00:46:01.600 --> 00:46:06.600]   It does point to it's not difficult to find out that the batteries you're receiving are
[00:46:06.600 --> 00:46:09.600]   larger than what you expect when you design the case.
[00:46:09.600 --> 00:46:15.600]   It sounds like the reason why the Note 7 would be delayed for two months as opposed to the
[00:46:15.600 --> 00:46:19.600]   reason why people are having their apartments burned down for it.
[00:46:19.600 --> 00:46:25.600]   I would have hoped they would have said, "Here's why we didn't catch that error and here's
[00:46:25.600 --> 00:46:27.600]   why we're not going to make that mistake again."
[00:46:27.600 --> 00:46:34.600]   Although I agree that the Note brand is so important.
[00:46:34.600 --> 00:46:35.600]   It's so valuable.
[00:46:35.600 --> 00:46:36.600]   Yeah.
[00:46:36.600 --> 00:46:46.600]   If Coke put rat poison in one out of every 400 cans and killed busloads of children,
[00:46:46.600 --> 00:46:51.600]   they would still hold on to the Coke brand because you can't rebuild the brand.
[00:46:51.600 --> 00:46:53.600]   You can rebuild trust, but you can't rebuild a brand.
[00:46:53.600 --> 00:46:58.600]   That would be pretty surprised if they hadn't gone with it.
[00:46:58.600 --> 00:47:01.600]   I like the Note 7.
[00:47:01.600 --> 00:47:03.600]   I'll definitely get a Note 8.
[00:47:03.600 --> 00:47:06.600]   I might even get it at Galaxy S8, although I'm more interested in the Note.
[00:47:06.600 --> 00:47:09.600]   I guess the Note's come out in the fall though, so maybe it won.
[00:47:09.600 --> 00:47:13.600]   You kind of know it's going to be the safest phone sounds like it ever made because it has to be.
[00:47:13.600 --> 00:47:15.600]   Also, it's going to be interesting.
[00:47:15.600 --> 00:47:22.600]   I'll make this quick, but I'm really expecting them to have the price is now
[00:47:22.600 --> 00:47:25.600]   $230 off contract.
[00:47:25.600 --> 00:47:29.600]   You get a basket of fun made by the staff.
[00:47:29.600 --> 00:47:33.600]   There are going to be so many incentives to get it because they realize that all they have to do is
[00:47:33.600 --> 00:47:38.600]   get that first month of sales back and the entire brand is back on its feet.
[00:47:38.600 --> 00:47:42.600]   I think that you're going to be pretty -- there are going to be a lot of incentives to go with the Note.
[00:47:42.600 --> 00:47:48.600]   Incidentally, rumors that the Galaxy S8 will not have a headphone jack, but we'll see.
[00:47:48.600 --> 00:47:51.600]   I hope Apple has not created its trend.
[00:47:51.600 --> 00:47:53.600]   That will make me very sad.
[00:47:53.600 --> 00:47:57.600]   It's hilarious because there are all the rumors now about OLED for the iPhone 8.
[00:47:57.600 --> 00:48:02.600]   Again, it's an implementation detail because they need to make that full screen and they might curve the screen
[00:48:02.600 --> 00:48:04.600]   and you just can't do that with LCD.
[00:48:04.600 --> 00:48:09.600]   That's how the Note 7 had so much screen real estate.
[00:48:09.600 --> 00:48:11.600]   I mean, that went -- didn't just go to the edge.
[00:48:11.600 --> 00:48:13.600]   It went around the edge.
[00:48:13.600 --> 00:48:20.600]   I guess since we mentioned Qualcomm, we should talk about this billion dollar lawsuit.
[00:48:20.600 --> 00:48:24.600]   We'll take a break and come back and do that, Renee Ritchie from iMore.com is here.
[00:48:24.600 --> 00:48:27.600]   Pokemon player extraordinaire.
[00:48:27.600 --> 00:48:33.600]   Just because of you, I had to fire up Pokemon and get this -- the Santa Claus Pikachu.
[00:48:33.600 --> 00:48:34.600]   Just because of you.
[00:48:34.600 --> 00:48:35.600]   Oh, awesome.
[00:48:35.600 --> 00:48:39.600]   My favorite memory from the New Year's show is when a site that appeared right on top of Steve Gibson
[00:48:39.600 --> 00:48:40.600]   and I got the screenshot.
[00:48:40.600 --> 00:48:43.600]   Steve smiling at the site there right next to him.
[00:48:43.600 --> 00:48:49.600]   Also, Andy Enaco, are you basically in the winter or is it just --
[00:48:49.600 --> 00:48:51.600]   I have been.
[00:48:51.600 --> 00:48:56.600]   It's actually -- the great thing about what intimidated me was my first real winter bicycling.
[00:48:56.600 --> 00:49:01.600]   I got the bike in January and it was freakishly warm from the entire year.
[00:49:01.600 --> 00:49:06.600]   The great thing is it turns out that you generate a lot of heat when you're actually pedaling
[00:49:06.600 --> 00:49:08.600]   and keeping your heart rate up.
[00:49:08.600 --> 00:49:15.600]   I'm passing by people in their cars in full arctic gear and I've got just a sweatshirt
[00:49:15.600 --> 00:49:20.600]   and then like an open, light spring jacket and just buzzing right past them because I'm perfectly
[00:49:20.600 --> 00:49:21.600]   perfectly cool.
[00:49:21.600 --> 00:49:22.600]   Good on you.
[00:49:22.600 --> 00:49:28.600]   I'm not insane enough to go when it's raining and that nasty, but it's great.
[00:49:28.600 --> 00:49:34.600]   Our show today brought to you by Zipper Cruder if you are in the enviable, unenviable position
[00:49:34.600 --> 00:49:36.600]   of hiring for your company.
[00:49:36.600 --> 00:49:39.600]   Maybe you are the company and so hiring is up to you.
[00:49:39.600 --> 00:49:44.600]   You know that it is a challenge, especially if you're a small company and you're short
[00:49:44.600 --> 00:49:46.600]   handed and you're trying to fill that position.
[00:49:46.600 --> 00:49:51.600]   The last thing you want to do is take time to hire, but it's also a very important position.
[00:49:51.600 --> 00:49:54.600]   It is enviable because you shape the company.
[00:49:54.600 --> 00:49:59.600]   A company is made of people and hiring the right person makes a huge difference.
[00:49:59.600 --> 00:50:04.600]   Let's assume that this opening you have -- there's somebody just perfect for it.
[00:50:04.600 --> 00:50:09.600]   You will just, you know, a year from now say, "Thank God we hired Joan.
[00:50:09.600 --> 00:50:10.600]   She changed the world.
[00:50:10.600 --> 00:50:11.600]   She's out there."
[00:50:11.600 --> 00:50:13.600]   Or, "He's out there."
[00:50:13.600 --> 00:50:16.600]   But how do you find that person?
[00:50:16.600 --> 00:50:18.600]   Do you know what board job boards they're on?
[00:50:18.600 --> 00:50:19.600]   Where are they applying?
[00:50:19.600 --> 00:50:20.600]   Where are they live?
[00:50:20.600 --> 00:50:21.600]   Do you know any of that?
[00:50:21.600 --> 00:50:22.600]   No.
[00:50:22.600 --> 00:50:28.600]   So wouldn't it make sense to go to zippercruder.com/twid post once and get that posting on more than
[00:50:28.600 --> 00:50:37.600]   200 job boards plus Twitter plus Facebook everywhere people are maximizing the number of people who see
[00:50:37.600 --> 00:50:39.600]   that perfect job.
[00:50:39.600 --> 00:50:42.600]   Maybe that perfect person is looking right now.
[00:50:42.600 --> 00:50:45.600]   You find candidates in any city, any industry nationwide.
[00:50:45.600 --> 00:50:48.600]   You post once and don't worry.
[00:50:48.600 --> 00:50:51.600]   Look at all the 200 million candidate applications delivered.
[00:50:51.600 --> 00:50:52.600]   That might scare you.
[00:50:52.600 --> 00:50:54.600]   Might say, "I don't want 200 million applications.
[00:50:54.600 --> 00:50:55.600]   Am I in buck?
[00:50:55.600 --> 00:50:56.600]   Don't worry."
[00:50:56.600 --> 00:51:01.600]   They go into the zippercruder interface where it's really easy to create a questionnaire, multiple
[00:51:01.600 --> 00:51:08.600]   choice, true/false, even essay questions that you can use to screen out people who just, you know, don't
[00:51:08.600 --> 00:51:11.600]   worry, and to narrow it down and hire the right person fast.
[00:51:11.600 --> 00:51:12.600]   No emails to your inbox.
[00:51:12.600 --> 00:51:13.600]   No resumes to your inbox.
[00:51:13.600 --> 00:51:18.600]   By the way, zippercruder formats all the resumes they get in a standardized fashion.
[00:51:18.600 --> 00:51:20.600]   So it's very easy for you.
[00:51:20.600 --> 00:51:25.600]   Your eyes don't have to adjust to all different weird formats of resumes.
[00:51:25.600 --> 00:51:27.600]   Also, no phone calls.
[00:51:27.600 --> 00:51:29.600]   It's all in the interface.
[00:51:29.600 --> 00:51:30.600]   It's really great.
[00:51:30.600 --> 00:51:37.600]   That's why we use it and why so many fortunate 100 companies and small and medium sized businesses
[00:51:37.600 --> 00:51:43.600]   over a million businesses use zip recruiter, some of the biggest in the world, and some
[00:51:43.600 --> 00:51:44.600]   of the smallest.
[00:51:44.600 --> 00:51:46.600]   We're one of the smallest.
[00:51:46.600 --> 00:51:47.600]   We love it.

[00:51:56.600 --> 00:51:58.600]   The time comes to do the hiring.
[00:51:58.600 --> 00:52:01.600]   Make sure you check out ZipRecruiter.
[00:52:01.600 --> 00:52:08.600]   So this is kind of a confusing story.
[00:52:08.600 --> 00:52:11.600]   The headline reads, "Apple sues Qualcomm for a billion dollars over royalties."
[00:52:11.600 --> 00:52:16.600]   But it also involves Qualcomm refusing to pay Apple a billion dollars.
[00:52:16.600 --> 00:52:19.600]   I mean, it's all complicated.
[00:52:19.600 --> 00:52:20.600]   Yeah.
[00:52:20.600 --> 00:52:25.600]   I mean, so the back story to all this is, and this has been going on for years, is that
[00:52:25.600 --> 00:52:29.600]   Qualcomm charges unusual licensing or royalty rates.
[00:52:29.600 --> 00:52:33.600]   I've heard rumors over the years that it's based on retail, but the current wisdom is
[00:52:33.600 --> 00:52:37.600]   that it's based on the full cost of device, not the cost of the Qualcomm parts in the device.
[00:52:37.600 --> 00:52:40.600]   Is that not a fran thing to do?
[00:52:40.600 --> 00:52:42.600]   No, it is probably the opposite of fran.
[00:52:42.600 --> 00:52:48.600]   So fran, the free and reasonable, that means that if you contribute towards an open standard,
[00:52:48.600 --> 00:52:52.600]   you're rewarded because people have to use your technology, but you're also held accountable
[00:52:52.600 --> 00:52:56.600]   because you have to make that technology free and reasonably priced to everybody who wants
[00:52:56.600 --> 00:52:57.600]   to use it.
[00:52:57.600 --> 00:53:02.120]   In this case, Qualcomm owns all of CDMA and parts of 3G and LTE technology, and those
[00:53:02.120 --> 00:53:03.120]   are necessary.
[00:53:03.120 --> 00:53:08.040]   If you want to sell a phone in the US and have it work on guys, if you want to use GSM or
[00:53:08.040 --> 00:53:11.840]   you want to use LTE networks, you have to use Qualcomm's technology.
[00:53:11.840 --> 00:53:15.840]   And because they've got made part of that standard, they have the responsibility of making
[00:53:15.840 --> 00:53:17.320]   sure technology is free.
[00:53:17.320 --> 00:53:18.920]   But Qualcomm has two different businesses.
[00:53:18.920 --> 00:53:22.400]   They have the business that licenses the technology, and they have the business that makes the
[00:53:22.400 --> 00:53:26.520]   chips, and that puts them in a unique situation where they can say, "Hey, if you buy our chips
[00:53:26.520 --> 00:53:30.200]   instead of somebody else's, we'll give you a break on the royalties."
[00:53:30.200 --> 00:53:32.600]   And that's the rebate that they're talking about here.
[00:53:32.600 --> 00:53:37.320]   But the underlying issue is, you see this when you have to pay $130 extra for a cellular
[00:53:37.320 --> 00:53:42.320]   iPad, is that they are charging licensing based on the full device.
[00:53:42.320 --> 00:53:46.960]   So they put a chip in that device that uses Qualcomm's royalties.
[00:53:46.960 --> 00:53:48.480]   That chip is a small part of that device.
[00:53:48.480 --> 00:53:54.480]   If Apple increases screen size, if they increase the amount of RAM or the amount of SSD or
[00:53:54.480 --> 00:53:58.880]   anything else, if they put an NFC chip in, that has nothing to do with Qualcomm, but it
[00:53:58.880 --> 00:54:02.880]   increases the total cost of the device, which means Qualcomm gets more money.
[00:54:02.880 --> 00:54:06.520]   So anything that you do to the phone, Qualcomm still makes more money off of it.
[00:54:06.520 --> 00:54:11.440]   And that many companies believe is not fair and borderline illegal.
[00:54:11.440 --> 00:54:15.520]   Absolutely, which is why China and other countries have pushed back.
[00:54:15.520 --> 00:54:20.680]   And companies like Apple have gotten deals where if they use Qualcomm technology like
[00:54:20.680 --> 00:54:25.240]   Apple until very recently, until this year in the iPhone 7, used Qualcomm chips because
[00:54:25.240 --> 00:54:29.800]   they would get a rebate quote unquote from Qualcomm for using their chips and licensing
[00:54:29.800 --> 00:54:33.520]   their patents, which made the amount of money they were paying more reasonable.
[00:54:33.520 --> 00:54:37.560]   And what Qualcomm asked for in exchange for their rebate was that these companies not
[00:54:37.560 --> 00:54:40.280]   cooperate with investigations against them.
[00:54:40.280 --> 00:54:41.280]   And Apple-
[00:54:41.280 --> 00:54:42.280]   Oh, you can't do that.
[00:54:42.280 --> 00:54:43.280]   Is that even legal?
[00:54:43.280 --> 00:54:47.680]   Apple ended up cooperating with an investigation and so Qualcomm withheld the payment.
[00:54:47.680 --> 00:54:51.120]   And Apple's like, we were compelled to cooperate.
[00:54:51.120 --> 00:54:52.120]   We can't not-
[00:54:52.120 --> 00:54:57.600]   It doesn't seem legal to say, if you want our royalties, you can't help the feds.
[00:54:57.600 --> 00:54:59.640]   And this was, I forget which country the investigation was in.
[00:54:59.640 --> 00:55:02.840]   I was thinking it was Korea was investigating this.
[00:55:02.840 --> 00:55:04.120]   And so they withheld the money.
[00:55:04.120 --> 00:55:07.960]   And then Apple, somebody tipped off the FTC and they started investigating.
[00:55:07.960 --> 00:55:09.520]   And then right after that, Apple sued.
[00:55:09.520 --> 00:55:10.520]   So-
[00:55:10.520 --> 00:55:11.680]   Oh, yeah, yeah.
[00:55:11.680 --> 00:55:16.240]   And yeah, some of these iPhones might have Intel radios, not Qualcomm radios.
[00:55:16.240 --> 00:55:20.280]   And of course, we've seen the benchmarks that show that the Intel radios are a lot slower.
[00:55:20.280 --> 00:55:22.520]   They're not as good as Qualcomm's.
[00:55:22.520 --> 00:55:28.120]   Apple artificially slows down the Qualcomm iPhone 7s so that there is slow as the Intel
[00:55:28.120 --> 00:55:30.720]   on LTE data, which is a little infuriating.
[00:55:30.720 --> 00:55:35.520]   I don't, you know, doesn't bother me because I don't have one of them.
[00:55:35.520 --> 00:55:36.520]   So this is-
[00:55:36.520 --> 00:55:40.160]   So really, it sounds like Apple's trying to kind of say, let's not use any more Qualcomm
[00:55:40.160 --> 00:55:41.160]   stuff.
[00:55:41.160 --> 00:55:44.080]   Yeah, there's a lot of pushback internationally against Qualcomm.
[00:55:44.080 --> 00:55:48.000]   For example, people always said, where's the 3G MacBook Pro?
[00:55:48.000 --> 00:55:51.800]   And you start to calculate what percentage of parts would be, like what the actual cost
[00:55:51.800 --> 00:55:55.160]   I would have to pay Qualcomm to put something in a $3,000 or $4,000 machine.
[00:55:55.160 --> 00:55:56.160]   So we're all suffering.
[00:55:56.160 --> 00:56:00.520]   And if you Google did the same thing, they didn't put LTE in the last pixel.
[00:56:00.520 --> 00:56:02.880]   And everybody's saying, it would be so great to have LTE.
[00:56:02.880 --> 00:56:08.720]   Well, now we know why because it's an expensive device and they'd have to give Qualcomm a
[00:56:08.720 --> 00:56:12.720]   commensurately larger royalty payment because the device is so expensive.
[00:56:12.720 --> 00:56:13.720]   Absolutely.
[00:56:13.720 --> 00:56:17.160]   And I'm saying like only Verizon and Sprint, there's some parts of China that use CDMA,
[00:56:17.160 --> 00:56:21.560]   but only Verizon and Sprint, the majority of the rest of the world use CDMA.
[00:56:21.560 --> 00:56:25.320]   But everyone was paying for a more expensive chip in their iPhone because that was the
[00:56:25.320 --> 00:56:28.600]   only chip that Apple was, you know, configured out a deal to put in those.
[00:56:28.600 --> 00:56:33.600]   So we were being, we were literally being held back and paying more because of the way
[00:56:33.600 --> 00:56:35.000]   that Qualcomm and CDMA led us.
[00:56:35.000 --> 00:56:37.000]   Very frustrating.
[00:56:37.000 --> 00:56:43.240]   So of course, Qualcomm's firing back saying Apple's misstating, you know, what happened
[00:56:43.240 --> 00:56:47.520]   and, you know, it's just, it's going to be one of those rancorous ugly things.
[00:56:47.520 --> 00:56:53.360]   Qualcomm also says, you don't want us to, you know, to do discovery, Apple, you're going
[00:56:53.360 --> 00:56:54.360]   to be sorry.
[00:56:54.360 --> 00:56:55.360]   The whole thing is a mess.
[00:56:55.360 --> 00:56:56.360]   Yeah.
[00:56:56.360 --> 00:56:59.680]   And the interesting thing is the FTC is not using the Sherman antitrust act, but Apple,
[00:56:59.680 --> 00:57:02.440]   I believe is part of part of their complaint is the antitrust act.
[00:57:02.440 --> 00:57:03.440]   They're using it.
[00:57:03.440 --> 00:57:06.640]   The FTC is looking at them from monopolistic abuse, but I forget the name of the exact
[00:57:06.640 --> 00:57:07.640]   act.
[00:57:07.640 --> 00:57:10.200]   It's it's different than the Sherman act where Apple's is more targeted on.
[00:57:10.200 --> 00:57:11.760]   Apple has a pretty cool.
[00:57:11.760 --> 00:57:16.120]   And Qualcomm, Apple has been actively encouraging regulatory attacks on Qualcomm's business in
[00:57:16.120 --> 00:57:20.720]   various jurisdictions around the world with a Korean FTC and the FTC.
[00:57:20.720 --> 00:57:24.760]   We welcome the opportunity to have these meritless claims heard in court where we will be entitled
[00:57:24.760 --> 00:57:28.520]   to full discovery of Apple's practices.
[00:57:28.520 --> 00:57:29.760]   That's a threat.
[00:57:29.760 --> 00:57:30.760]   You know what?
[00:57:30.760 --> 00:57:33.320]   I am not liking Qualcomm at this point.
[00:57:33.320 --> 00:57:35.480]   Most people have not liked Qualcomm for several years.
[00:57:35.480 --> 00:57:37.200]   I feel like they are.
[00:57:37.200 --> 00:57:39.560]   It sounds like that's how you feel as well.
[00:57:39.560 --> 00:57:44.520]   It sounds like just of what you've said, Qualcomm is predatory is using predatory.
[00:57:44.520 --> 00:57:45.520]   Yeah.
[00:57:45.520 --> 00:57:48.320]   Based on my understanding of the last few years, I believe they've been incredibly abusive
[00:57:48.320 --> 00:57:49.800]   in terms of how they licensed technology.
[00:57:49.800 --> 00:57:54.520]   And I'm particularly I'm particularly annoyed when anybody violates the spirit of Fran, let
[00:57:54.520 --> 00:57:57.640]   alone the letter of it, the way they seem to be doing.
[00:57:57.640 --> 00:58:01.200]   And this is a tough one because it is international.
[00:58:01.200 --> 00:58:08.320]   So you know, Apple maybe could get regulatory relief in the US, but it's not it's fortunately
[00:58:08.320 --> 00:58:09.320]   CDMA.
[00:58:09.320 --> 00:58:11.440]   So it's only slightly international.
[00:58:11.440 --> 00:58:16.720]   Why does an Apple just abandon CDMA say let's let's all but that's LTE too, isn't it?
[00:58:16.720 --> 00:58:20.680]   Yeah, I mean, they have partial patents for the 3G standard partial patents for the LTE
[00:58:20.680 --> 00:58:21.680]   standard.
[00:58:21.680 --> 00:58:22.680]   They're in bed.
[00:58:22.680 --> 00:58:26.040]   They're one of several companies that control wireless radios and you have to that was a
[00:58:26.040 --> 00:58:28.760]   whole point of the Fran though, is that they would be part of that standard because they
[00:58:28.760 --> 00:58:32.080]   would be free and discriminatory about their licensing.
[00:58:32.080 --> 00:58:34.120]   And it turns out they were predatory.
[00:58:34.120 --> 00:58:37.560]   Well, you got but you got to figure this is a very difficult thing to to solve.
[00:58:37.560 --> 00:58:39.040]   It was a license to print money.
[00:58:39.040 --> 00:58:42.360]   I mean, anybody who's on Qualcomm's side is like, go, go, go, get as much extract as
[00:58:42.360 --> 00:58:44.760]   much value as you can from this do everything possible.
[00:58:44.760 --> 00:58:47.480]   But that's sort of what got Microsoft and Intel into trouble for a long time.
[00:58:47.480 --> 00:58:50.960]   Well, and there are a lot of people invested in Qualcomm stock who are very, very happy
[00:58:50.960 --> 00:58:53.120]   with all the money they've made.
[00:58:53.120 --> 00:58:57.320]   Because Qualcomm's very high flyer.
[00:58:57.320 --> 00:59:01.400]   But as users, we maybe shouldn't be so happy because it adds directly to the cost of our
[00:59:01.400 --> 00:59:02.400]   devices.
[00:59:02.400 --> 00:59:07.400]   Yeah, ultimately we have Apple doesn't pay for it.
[00:59:07.400 --> 00:59:08.400]   Yep.
[00:59:08.400 --> 00:59:17.280]   Replacement for Apple's flagship 5th Avenue retail store.
[00:59:17.280 --> 00:59:19.920]   What's that all about?
[00:59:19.920 --> 00:59:20.920]   They're renovating.
[00:59:20.920 --> 00:59:22.880]   So they put they put the stuff in the building.
[00:59:22.880 --> 00:59:24.640]   That's the last one.
[00:59:24.640 --> 00:59:28.440]   Yeah, they're doing the Apple to I don't know if it's 2.0 or 3.0, whatever they did with
[00:59:28.440 --> 00:59:30.560]   Union Square, they're doing that with 5th Avenue.
[00:59:30.560 --> 00:59:32.840]   And while they're doing that, they've moved behind the building to it.
[00:59:32.840 --> 00:59:34.960]   Is it just internal or is it external as well?
[00:59:34.960 --> 00:59:37.400]   Because it's really iconic at this point, that glass.
[00:59:37.400 --> 00:59:39.000]   I haven't seen anything to say it's external.
[00:59:39.000 --> 00:59:41.760]   I believe it's just doing the same sort of internal remake.
[00:59:41.760 --> 00:59:42.760]   Okay.
[00:59:42.760 --> 00:59:46.640]   Yeah, remember that this is not just a successful retail store.
[00:59:46.640 --> 00:59:49.400]   It's a successful New York City landmark at this point.
[00:59:49.400 --> 00:59:50.400]   Yeah.
[00:59:50.400 --> 00:59:55.800]   And also it's way too valuable to let anything ding the amount of money they're making per
[00:59:55.800 --> 00:59:56.800]   square foot.
[00:59:56.800 --> 00:59:59.000]   So yeah, it's going to be fun.
[00:59:59.000 --> 01:00:03.400]   This is the only FAO short store right next door right now.
[01:00:03.400 --> 01:00:04.400]   Yeah.
[01:00:04.400 --> 01:00:08.680]   The cool GEE building actually CBS has their like news.
[01:00:08.680 --> 01:00:15.040]   But when the new studios down there, these do they use that plaza for like outside the
[01:00:15.040 --> 01:00:16.520]   studio remotes.
[01:00:16.520 --> 01:00:18.880]   It's a real heavy place.
[01:00:18.880 --> 01:00:23.960]   The last renovation was in 2011 when they increased the sheet, the size of the sheets
[01:00:23.960 --> 01:00:24.960]   of glass.
[01:00:24.960 --> 01:00:25.960]   Remember, this is very famous.
[01:00:25.960 --> 01:00:28.720]   Steve Jobs didn't want any pains.
[01:00:28.720 --> 01:00:35.960]   He wanted just the cube just to be all glass and the building owner said those are going
[01:00:35.960 --> 01:00:38.600]   to collapse and kill people.
[01:00:38.600 --> 01:00:41.960]   So they had to cut those up into 90 pieces.
[01:00:41.960 --> 01:00:44.520]   And then in 2011, they were able to technology to improve.
[01:00:44.520 --> 01:00:48.920]   They were able to reduce it to 15.
[01:00:48.920 --> 01:00:50.600]   And so we'll see.
[01:00:50.600 --> 01:00:51.600]   We'll see.
[01:00:51.600 --> 01:00:52.600]   They're not going to change that look.
[01:00:52.600 --> 01:00:53.600]   They're just going to change.
[01:00:53.600 --> 01:00:54.600]   What is the end?
[01:00:54.600 --> 01:00:56.400]   Is this like a new layout for Apple retail?
[01:00:56.400 --> 01:00:58.200]   Is like some big change?
[01:00:58.200 --> 01:00:59.200]   They're new.
[01:00:59.200 --> 01:01:02.480]   Yes, I think that they announced with the new square where Angela Aaron's Johnny has
[01:01:02.480 --> 01:01:03.640]   been working on this new concept.
[01:01:03.640 --> 01:01:08.000]   Yeah, like the genius grove instead of the genius bar and the avenue where it has all
[01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:11.440]   the different sort of mini boutiques for the different products and the area where you
[01:01:11.440 --> 01:01:13.640]   can go and sort of get presentations.
[01:01:13.640 --> 01:01:19.040]   It's just they want to be more community centric was their sort of goal.
[01:01:19.040 --> 01:01:24.400]   Also they're having a big problem with just traffic flow through the store where the when
[01:01:24.400 --> 01:01:28.040]   with the Apple store was founded, you have the old convention that you're going to put
[01:01:28.040 --> 01:01:30.280]   the customer service desk way, way at the back.
[01:01:30.280 --> 01:01:34.200]   So people have to go move through the store and maybe consider, gee, if I owned a brand
[01:01:34.200 --> 01:01:36.480]   new Macbook, I wouldn't keep having to have the old one.
[01:01:36.480 --> 01:01:37.960]   The old one fixed like this.
[01:01:37.960 --> 01:01:42.840]   But when you go into an Apple store and you see those huge, huge crowds, how many are buying
[01:01:42.840 --> 01:01:45.200]   and how many are just waiting for their genius bar appointment.
[01:01:45.200 --> 01:01:47.320]   So a lot of this is just basically.
[01:01:47.320 --> 01:01:48.960]   Well, and that's good too.
[01:01:48.960 --> 01:01:54.400]   But it's it's it means that people who are lingering in front of a point of sale, excuse
[01:01:54.400 --> 01:02:00.480]   me, in front of an iPad case display or lingering in front of a display of the new Macbooks,
[01:02:00.480 --> 01:02:03.320]   they're making it harder for the people who came in to buy a MacBook or check out the
[01:02:03.320 --> 01:02:04.560]   new hardware to get there.
[01:02:04.560 --> 01:02:07.320]   So I'm sure that they're using all the data they've collected over the years of operating
[01:02:07.320 --> 01:02:10.800]   the Apple store to figure out how do we move people through the store more efficiently.
[01:02:10.800 --> 01:02:13.520]   And that's always the science of every single store design.
[01:02:13.520 --> 01:02:15.360]   Apple or not.
[01:02:15.360 --> 01:02:25.400]   Getting mysterious in even filing with the FCC for a wireless device, a 1846 with NFC
[01:02:25.400 --> 01:02:27.680]   and Bluetooth.
[01:02:27.680 --> 01:02:29.960]   What do you think that is?
[01:02:29.960 --> 01:02:32.760]   I think it's the same one that was that made the rounds.
[01:02:32.760 --> 01:02:39.960]   Yeah, 1846 made the rounds before I forget the month of November, October, some speculation
[01:02:39.960 --> 01:02:47.320]   according to Mac rumors that it might be a new Apple TV or given the design of the product
[01:02:47.320 --> 01:02:51.120]   and the prominent FCC labeling, which Apple hates, right?
[01:02:51.120 --> 01:02:55.720]   It's much more likely this is a behind the scenes object that will not see a public release.
[01:02:55.720 --> 01:02:59.160]   There were a ton of devices that got a lot of attention that went through FCC that ended
[01:02:59.160 --> 01:03:03.000]   up being the new displays for the new things that they put things on in the Apple store,
[01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:06.200]   like the terminals that you would go up and press buttons and stuff.
[01:03:06.200 --> 01:03:11.000]   Yeah, somebody said maybe it's a beacon, beaking device of some kind.
[01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:12.000]   Okay.
[01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:13.320]   So nothing to get all hot.
[01:03:13.320 --> 01:03:17.280]   It's not a typical retail model number, but you never know.
[01:03:17.280 --> 01:03:18.280]   What is that?
[01:03:18.280 --> 01:03:20.440]   A 1846 sounds like an iPhone.
[01:03:20.440 --> 01:03:24.400]   I don't think I don't think the iPhone numbers are that I forget the iPhone.
[01:03:24.400 --> 01:03:26.800]   I'm not looking up, but I believe they're quite different than the other.
[01:03:26.800 --> 01:03:28.280]   I didn't recognize it.
[01:03:28.280 --> 01:03:30.280]   Okay, never mind.
[01:03:30.280 --> 01:03:31.560]   Title.
[01:03:31.560 --> 01:03:33.560]   This is interesting.
[01:03:33.560 --> 01:03:41.160]   The Jay Z's music service, the one that has lossless music for a high price and the one
[01:03:41.160 --> 01:03:45.320]   that kind of misrepresented its total subscriber numbers publicly.
[01:03:45.320 --> 01:03:48.680]   They were saying I think 3 million and then when they paid their royalties a few months
[01:03:48.680 --> 01:03:58.640]   ago, it was 840,000 just sold a third of itself to Sprint, which keeps it alive, right?
[01:03:58.640 --> 01:04:01.760]   I mean, that's one of the things Apple has an advantage.
[01:04:01.760 --> 01:04:05.960]   Apple, Google and Amazon, none of them have to make their music services pay for themselves
[01:04:05.960 --> 01:04:08.440]   like Spotify and Title had to.
[01:04:08.440 --> 01:04:11.120]   With Sprint in the game, maybe that could make a big difference.
[01:04:11.120 --> 01:04:14.800]   Apparently, Sprint will have some sort of exclusive artist content.
[01:04:14.800 --> 01:04:17.200]   Zero in all the things.
[01:04:17.200 --> 01:04:18.200]   Yeah.
[01:04:18.200 --> 01:04:22.400]   And they can also do things like basically say that traffic on our network from the title
[01:04:22.400 --> 01:04:25.920]   store does not count towards your bandwidth cap.
[01:04:25.920 --> 01:04:30.360]   It's I think you look to see a lot more of these deals coming in the future because T-Mobile
[01:04:30.360 --> 01:04:35.360]   is kind of making things difficult for all their carriers when they say, "Okay, guess
[01:04:35.360 --> 01:04:36.360]   what?
[01:04:36.360 --> 01:04:41.040]   All of your streaming video is free, streaming audio is free.
[01:04:41.040 --> 01:04:44.440]   We will let you add additional lives to your family for 20 bucks if you and your spouse
[01:04:44.440 --> 01:04:46.920]   have already have extra lines."
[01:04:46.920 --> 01:04:51.040]   And so they really, AT&T and Verizon really have to do something to address all these
[01:04:51.040 --> 01:04:55.480]   people who should be considering at least switching to a different plan.
[01:04:55.480 --> 01:05:01.400]   Let me connect the dots a little bit here too because Sprint is owned by SoftBank.
[01:05:01.400 --> 01:05:07.120]   And you remember that Masayoshi Son, the multi-billionaire owner of SoftBank met with
[01:05:07.120 --> 01:05:13.160]   Donald Trump in the transition and pledged to bring jobs to the US and so forth.
[01:05:13.160 --> 01:05:19.560]   Trump has now replaced the chairman of the FCC with one of its commissioners who is a
[01:05:19.560 --> 01:05:22.760]   rabid, anti-net neutrality guy.
[01:05:22.760 --> 01:05:27.600]   I think that the regulatory climate is shifting dramatically and companies that might have
[01:05:27.600 --> 01:05:30.720]   been worried in the past about this is called zero rating.
[01:05:30.720 --> 01:05:35.560]   T-Mobile does a lot of it and many consider zero rating to be a violation of net neutrality.
[01:05:35.560 --> 01:05:40.760]   Well, green light, clearly that's not going to be an issue at all going forward.
[01:05:40.760 --> 01:05:48.120]   So I expect to see a lot of these kinds of deals as carriers position themselves and
[01:05:48.120 --> 01:05:51.720]   Internet service providers who are carriers, you know, carriers are Internet service providers
[01:05:51.720 --> 01:05:56.360]   but also traditional ISPs position themselves to take advantage of relaxed net neutrality
[01:05:56.360 --> 01:05:58.080]   rules.
[01:05:58.080 --> 01:06:00.320]   This could be very much related to that.
[01:06:00.320 --> 01:06:06.200]   Not only net neutrality but mergers and there's probably won't be any trust.
[01:06:06.200 --> 01:06:13.360]   Although Obama administration did very few antitrust moves but some of the big ones including
[01:06:13.360 --> 01:06:17.200]   you know the signaling that the Sprint and T-Mobile merger should not happen and that
[01:06:17.200 --> 01:06:19.520]   AT&T could buy Sprint.
[01:06:19.520 --> 01:06:23.760]   I mean, there's just a lot of, not all of these, not all of these possible changes are bad
[01:06:23.760 --> 01:06:24.760]   either.
[01:06:24.760 --> 01:06:30.040]   The new FCC chairman for instance has previously spoken about how he would like to essentially
[01:06:30.040 --> 01:06:36.280]   make it so that if you're digging up the street to make it an improvement to like phone lines
[01:06:36.280 --> 01:06:41.880]   to electric lines, you also have to bury other lines as well that the community can use so
[01:06:41.880 --> 01:06:44.240]   that you don't have to keep, they don't have to keep digging up the streets.
[01:06:44.240 --> 01:06:51.480]   He wants to make it easier for new services to also get access to that wire as well so
[01:06:51.480 --> 01:06:54.720]   that you can't say, "Well, I'm sorry, we're the ones who buried this wire so we're the
[01:06:54.720 --> 01:06:57.040]   only people who can provide services across this wire."
[01:06:57.040 --> 01:06:58.520]   So there's a mixed bag.
[01:06:58.520 --> 01:07:02.680]   It means that in two years time we could be very surprised at things that we thought
[01:07:02.680 --> 01:07:07.360]   were sacrosanct that are now completely different and things that we thought could never possibly
[01:07:07.360 --> 01:07:10.840]   excuse me, good things that could possibly never happen that are now easy to implement.
[01:07:10.840 --> 01:07:18.040]   So it's a good period in which to be reading a lot in the Tech page of New York Times or
[01:07:18.040 --> 01:07:19.040]   any other places.
[01:07:19.040 --> 01:07:20.040]   Absolutely.
[01:07:20.040 --> 01:07:21.040]   And that's...
[01:07:21.040 --> 01:07:22.040]   That's a high-level.
[01:07:22.040 --> 01:07:26.040]   And Pi has a four-point plan which, including that opening up the lines that I think in
[01:07:26.040 --> 01:07:28.520]   many respects might be very strong.
[01:07:28.520 --> 01:07:32.720]   Here's his regulatory philosophy and I can't disagree with a lot of this.
[01:07:32.720 --> 01:07:36.080]   Customers benefit most from competition, not preemptive regulation.
[01:07:36.080 --> 01:07:39.920]   Of course the issue is do we have competition among ISPs.
[01:07:39.920 --> 01:07:43.840]   Free markets have delivered more value to American consumers and highly regulated ones.
[01:07:43.840 --> 01:07:49.520]   And I would totally agree with that as long as you support competition and the FCC in
[01:07:49.520 --> 01:07:54.320]   the past has really eliminated competition and certainly in Internet service providers.
[01:07:54.320 --> 01:07:56.760]   No regulatory system should indulge arbitrage.
[01:07:56.760 --> 01:07:57.760]   I like this.
[01:07:57.760 --> 01:08:03.440]   Regulators should be skeptical of pleas to regulate rivals, dispense favors or otherwise
[01:08:03.440 --> 01:08:05.200]   afford special treatment.
[01:08:05.200 --> 01:08:10.720]   The AT&T complains about sprint, probably something the FCC should get involved in.
[01:08:10.720 --> 01:08:14.680]   Particularly given how rapidly communications are changing, FCC should do everything it
[01:08:14.680 --> 01:08:19.040]   can to ensure its rules reflect the realities of the current marketplace and basic principles
[01:08:19.040 --> 01:08:20.440]   of economics.
[01:08:20.440 --> 01:08:25.560]   That worries me a little bit because not everyone agrees on the basic principles of economics.
[01:08:25.560 --> 01:08:30.000]   Yeah, but it's good to...
[01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:37.160]   I guess he's the sort of public official I like to see in principle in that when I read
[01:08:37.160 --> 01:08:42.360]   what he's actually saying, here's what I've been reading reported by some people or alerted
[01:08:42.360 --> 01:08:43.360]   by us other people.
[01:08:43.360 --> 01:08:47.040]   When I actually look at the statements that he's made in the past as an Obama appointee
[01:08:47.040 --> 01:08:51.200]   and these days, I see a lot of things that, wow, that's actually a good idea.
[01:08:51.200 --> 01:08:52.920]   I see a lot of how that could...
[01:08:52.920 --> 01:08:59.080]   And a lot of things like let's rethink net neutrality that makes me wonder, oh geez.
[01:08:59.080 --> 01:09:03.400]   But I just remember how wrong we were about Tom Wheeler.
[01:09:03.400 --> 01:09:08.440]   And I think I'm willing to reserve judgment until we see what actually happens.
[01:09:08.440 --> 01:09:13.120]   But I do worry about net neutrality regulations being thrown out the window.
[01:09:13.120 --> 01:09:17.640]   Yeah, he says that's part of the problem where there's a lot of stuff he's saying that I
[01:09:17.640 --> 01:09:21.960]   believe he not only, again, not only his public statements now is the head of the FCC, but
[01:09:21.960 --> 01:09:23.240]   we have lots of data behind him.
[01:09:23.240 --> 01:09:24.240]   He's not like a political...
[01:09:24.240 --> 01:09:29.520]   He's not just, hey, here's a person who finished third on season four of the apprentices.
[01:09:29.520 --> 01:09:30.520]   Yeah, no, unusually.
[01:09:30.520 --> 01:09:32.440]   He has some background of this.
[01:09:32.440 --> 01:09:35.520]   Right, so we can actually look at his actual track record.
[01:09:35.520 --> 01:09:39.960]   And his actual track record, I think you can disagree, and I disagree with a lot of his
[01:09:39.960 --> 01:09:42.720]   statements, but they seem to be very, very informed.
[01:09:42.720 --> 01:09:47.960]   They seem to be produced from a philosophy about the role that the FCC can have in making
[01:09:47.960 --> 01:09:52.840]   things better as opposed to the role that the FCC can have in protecting companies from
[01:09:52.840 --> 01:09:55.840]   pesky consumers who want to do what they want to do.
[01:09:55.840 --> 01:09:58.360]   But so I'm going to be paying close attention.
[01:09:58.360 --> 01:10:00.880]   Again, how many times...
[01:10:00.880 --> 01:10:06.200]   In these days, I'm telling myself as well as anybody else that it's easy to say that
[01:10:06.200 --> 01:10:11.320]   anybody who has anything to do with an administration that you don't like must be...
[01:10:11.320 --> 01:10:16.840]   They must be a hack, it must be on talent or they must not be doing their jobs well.
[01:10:16.840 --> 01:10:19.080]   That's going to really tank us.
[01:10:19.080 --> 01:10:22.360]   And the inability to see people who are actually doing a good job, we just don't like their
[01:10:22.360 --> 01:10:23.360]   boss.
[01:10:23.360 --> 01:10:24.360]   Right.
[01:10:24.360 --> 01:10:25.360]   I agree 100%.
[01:10:25.360 --> 01:10:28.800]   I don't like his boss, but I agree 100%.
[01:10:28.800 --> 01:10:29.800]   Actually the boss...
[01:10:29.800 --> 01:10:33.880]   This is the other thing that you got to remember is the real boss of the FCC is and always
[01:10:33.880 --> 01:10:34.880]   has been Congress.
[01:10:34.880 --> 01:10:42.080]   The FCC operates its mandate directly from rules promulgated in Congress by laws like
[01:10:42.080 --> 01:10:43.600]   the Telecommunications Act.
[01:10:43.600 --> 01:10:44.960]   There's some room for interpretation.
[01:10:44.960 --> 01:10:49.680]   In some felt that Tom Wheeler went too far by invoking, was it Title II or Title III of
[01:10:49.680 --> 01:10:53.800]   Communications Act to regulate internet service providers?
[01:10:53.800 --> 01:10:56.120]   That will be rolled back for sure.
[01:10:56.120 --> 01:10:58.360]   We'll just have to wait and see...
[01:10:58.360 --> 01:11:00.080]   I'm all for competition.
[01:11:00.080 --> 01:11:03.760]   The best thing that could happen in this country is to have true competition among internet
[01:11:03.760 --> 01:11:04.760]   service providers.
[01:11:04.760 --> 01:11:05.760]   Yeah.
[01:11:05.760 --> 01:11:10.360]   I think about the things that are happening in Wisconsin with alternative energy, where
[01:11:10.360 --> 01:11:11.360]   they're making...
[01:11:11.360 --> 01:11:16.360]   Now that power utilities have done enough projections to see that here is what damage,
[01:11:16.360 --> 01:11:19.360]   wind power and solar can do to our bottom line.
[01:11:19.360 --> 01:11:25.680]   They are basically having the legislature pass laws to make it absolutely unfeasible for
[01:11:25.680 --> 01:11:29.320]   anybody to install a wind farm or put solar panels on their roof.
[01:11:29.320 --> 01:11:33.360]   They're basically killing this alternative means of energy before it can even get off
[01:11:33.360 --> 01:11:34.360]   the ground.
[01:11:34.360 --> 01:11:39.320]   As long as he means he actually wants competition, as opposed to he wants to make sure that
[01:11:39.320 --> 01:11:44.080]   anybody who has the loudest voice in the lobbying community gets to decide what policy
[01:11:44.080 --> 01:11:45.080]   is.
[01:11:45.080 --> 01:11:50.880]   He's definitely on that list of people who will say, "I'm willing to give him a chance.
[01:11:50.880 --> 01:11:55.280]   I'm willing to wait and see what he does because he looks like he's really on the ball and
[01:11:55.280 --> 01:12:00.440]   he has a really good philosophy whether I agree with specific expressions of that philosophy
[01:12:00.440 --> 01:12:01.440]   or not."
[01:12:01.440 --> 01:12:05.440]   I don't like plugging other podcasts, but in this case I'm going to have to...
[01:12:05.440 --> 01:12:11.920]   John Syracuse and Marco Arment got Chris Latner on their ATP podcast.
[01:12:11.920 --> 01:12:12.920]   That's a great get.
[01:12:12.920 --> 01:12:19.360]   At Turner, we talked about a couple of weeks ago, a creator of LLVM in Clang, Swift Programming
[01:12:19.360 --> 01:12:25.840]   Language, left Apple to go to Tesla where he wants to make Tesla's appliances and some
[01:12:25.840 --> 01:12:30.640]   interesting quotes from Latner.
[01:12:30.640 --> 01:12:32.400]   I'm just mad that we didn't get him first.
[01:12:32.400 --> 01:12:37.440]   - I mean, yeah, me too, but Syracuse is just the right person to interview him.
[01:12:37.440 --> 01:12:41.160]   - John, John is absolutely the technical expert.
[01:12:41.160 --> 01:12:42.920]   It goes very deep in this stuff.
[01:12:42.920 --> 01:12:44.400]   Yep, I completely agree.
[01:12:44.400 --> 01:12:49.920]   - It turns out it was his Copeland 20, I forget the first one, Copeland 2012 or 2014 article
[01:12:49.920 --> 01:12:51.560]   that spurred a lot of this.
[01:12:51.560 --> 01:12:52.560]   - Interesting.
[01:12:52.560 --> 01:12:53.560]   - Oh, interesting.
[01:12:53.560 --> 01:12:56.720]   Okay.
[01:12:56.720 --> 01:13:01.240]   On the creation of Swift Latner says, "Initially, this is from your article on I'm more."
[01:13:01.240 --> 01:13:04.600]   Initially, it was just me messing around and nobody knew about it because it wasn't anything
[01:13:04.600 --> 01:13:05.600]   to know about.
[01:13:05.600 --> 01:13:09.480]   Eventually, it got a little bit more serious and I said, "Hey, after playing around a little
[01:13:09.480 --> 01:13:11.520]   bit, I think that this actually could make sense."
[01:13:11.520 --> 01:13:15.000]   So I started talking to my management and some of the engineers that were working on
[01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:16.560]   Clang, they seemed excited about it.
[01:13:16.560 --> 01:13:18.400]   We got a couple people working on it part-time.
[01:13:18.400 --> 01:13:22.200]   I love a company where a guy, really smart guy, could say, "What if we did this?"
[01:13:22.200 --> 01:13:24.400]   And they say, "Okay, we got a couple people."
[01:13:24.400 --> 01:13:25.400]   - So that's the thing.
[01:13:25.400 --> 01:13:26.720]   - Yeah, convinced my manager was interesting enough.
[01:13:26.720 --> 01:13:29.400]   We could have a couple people work on it.
[01:13:29.400 --> 01:13:30.400]   - That's the thing.
[01:13:30.400 --> 01:13:33.520]   There's been a lot of talk recently that Apple has become too organized under Tim Cook and
[01:13:33.520 --> 01:13:37.200]   they're not a scrappy upstart anymore, but they absolutely are in key areas.
[01:13:37.200 --> 01:13:41.080]   There are features that marketing pushes down and says, "We need to have these to be competitive
[01:13:41.080 --> 01:13:42.080]   on the next iPhone."
[01:13:42.080 --> 01:13:46.960]   But some of the biggest features we've had in many years, like Swift or Extensibility,
[01:13:46.960 --> 01:13:50.240]   things like that, have started with an idea that an engineer had and they managed to push
[01:13:50.240 --> 01:13:51.960]   through the entire company.
[01:13:51.960 --> 01:13:55.840]   And when I speak to some of the people at Apple, people who have left now but who were
[01:13:55.840 --> 01:13:59.200]   Apple for a very long time, they said that they had tons of other offers, but there were
[01:13:59.200 --> 01:14:03.880]   very few companies where, and I think Latiners says this in that interview as well, where
[01:14:03.880 --> 01:14:07.920]   a single engineer could make a difference in a product that ships to hundreds of millions
[01:14:07.920 --> 01:14:08.920]   of people.
[01:14:08.920 --> 01:14:11.680]   There's some companies that just never ship and some companies that don't have very big
[01:14:11.680 --> 01:14:15.920]   user bases, but at Apple, you can be one engineer who has an idea and that engineer could end
[01:14:15.920 --> 01:14:21.640]   up, that idea could end up manifesting itself in education or computer science or something
[01:14:21.640 --> 01:14:26.200]   that is really beneficial and at a huge scale and that's super valuable to them.
[01:14:26.200 --> 01:14:28.880]   - Apple Tech Podcast ATP 205.
[01:14:28.880 --> 01:14:30.880]   - Accidental Tech.
[01:14:30.880 --> 01:14:32.880]   - Accidental Tech Podcast, what did I call it?
[01:14:32.880 --> 01:14:34.640]   Apple accidental tech podcast.
[01:14:34.640 --> 01:14:36.480]   People don't use the weird parts.
[01:14:36.480 --> 01:14:38.120]   They got good names too.
[01:14:38.120 --> 01:14:40.400]   - It's with Casey listed and a couple other guys.
[01:14:40.400 --> 01:14:41.400]   - Yeah.
[01:14:41.400 --> 01:14:44.200]   Casey lists Marco Arman, John Syracuse, ATP.fm.
[01:14:44.200 --> 01:14:45.880]   I'm giving them a big plug.
[01:14:45.880 --> 01:14:47.400]   Don't listen to that show, please.
[01:14:47.400 --> 01:14:48.400]   - Please.
[01:14:48.400 --> 01:14:49.400]   - Ever.
[01:14:49.400 --> 01:14:51.240]   - Unless you like awesome podcasts.
[01:14:51.240 --> 01:14:52.240]   - Oh, shut up.
[01:14:52.240 --> 01:14:54.400]   - You'll listen to this podcast clearly you like awesome podcasts.
[01:14:54.400 --> 01:14:57.160]   - I'm not that competitive.
[01:14:57.160 --> 01:15:02.440]   Let's take a break and your tips and picks and whatever else you want to talk about as
[01:15:02.440 --> 01:15:07.920]   we conclude today's stunning edition of Mac Break Weekly.
[01:15:07.920 --> 01:15:12.320]   Our show today brought to you by Take Talking About Competitors.
[01:15:12.320 --> 01:15:16.520]   If you have only two ears, you've got to choose.
[01:15:16.520 --> 01:15:19.760]   Audible, oh man, I spent a lot of time listening to Audible.
[01:15:19.760 --> 01:15:22.600]   It is the best audio bookstore.
[01:15:22.600 --> 01:15:28.440]   All kinds of literature fiction, nonfiction, even magazines, performances, speeches.
[01:15:28.440 --> 01:15:30.320]   We can get you a free audiobook.
[01:15:30.320 --> 01:15:31.320]   That's the easy part.
[01:15:31.320 --> 01:15:38.360]   The hard part is, but which of the hundreds of thousands of great books do you pick?
[01:15:38.360 --> 01:15:44.360]   I always love it when my Audible Membership Day is the 22nd.
[01:15:44.360 --> 01:15:48.600]   So I'm sitting here with a couple of credits in my account just waiting to hear what Andy
[01:15:48.600 --> 01:15:50.320]   and Akko recommends.
[01:15:50.320 --> 01:15:54.320]   - Yeah, I just bought postcards from the edge.
[01:15:54.320 --> 01:15:58.000]   - Oh, you know that's appropriate.
[01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:03.680]   - I was surprised that I guess they must be rushing to get the Kindle or the ebook edition
[01:16:03.680 --> 01:16:06.560]   into print because it's surprising that wasn't available.
[01:16:06.560 --> 01:16:12.200]   But oh my goodness, I've been rereading a lot of her books and just loving that wit, that
[01:16:12.200 --> 01:16:14.160]   insight, that point of view.
[01:16:14.160 --> 01:16:16.040]   This point is it's not a long read.
[01:16:16.040 --> 01:16:17.040]   It's only about two and a half hours.
[01:16:17.040 --> 01:16:19.200]   - It's because it's a bridge, unfortunately.
[01:16:19.200 --> 01:16:22.520]   - Yeah, but it's her reading her own book.
[01:16:22.520 --> 01:16:23.520]   - Right.
[01:16:23.520 --> 01:16:24.880]   - And so there's nothing like it.
[01:16:24.880 --> 01:16:31.320]   So better, good is the book on audio.
[01:16:31.320 --> 01:16:34.600]   Better is when the author reads their own book.
[01:16:34.600 --> 01:16:38.600]   Best is when the author is in herself an actor.
[01:16:38.600 --> 01:16:44.760]   So she's both intimately familiar with every word and also she knows how to deliver characters.
[01:16:44.760 --> 01:16:45.760]   So I haven't listened to it yet.
[01:16:45.760 --> 01:16:48.400]   I'm saving it for my flight this weekend.
[01:16:48.400 --> 01:16:53.640]   - Oh, well, and you know, the Princess Diarist, her last book is out now as well.
[01:16:53.640 --> 01:16:55.280]   And she does also read books.
[01:16:55.280 --> 01:16:57.040]   - Already got that one and that one was just.
[01:16:57.040 --> 01:16:58.680]   - Was it good?
[01:16:58.680 --> 01:16:59.680]   - Very, very good.
[01:16:59.680 --> 01:17:02.720]   - This is the one where she blows the lid off her relationship with Harrison Ford.
[01:17:02.720 --> 01:17:04.920]   - Yeah, but it's so delightful.
[01:17:04.920 --> 01:17:10.440]   It's not like one of the former Brady bunch kids realized that, hey, I could pay off my
[01:17:10.440 --> 01:17:13.920]   mortgage if I say that I made out with Greg Brady by the way.
[01:17:13.920 --> 01:17:15.480]   - She's 19 at the time.
[01:17:15.480 --> 01:17:17.600]   And the whole thing is her diaries from that era.
[01:17:17.600 --> 01:17:18.600]   - That's great.
[01:17:18.600 --> 01:17:21.600]   - But not only that, it's not like her reading her diaries.
[01:17:21.600 --> 01:17:29.360]   It really is here is a woman 40 years later observing herself at age 19 and in her thoughts
[01:17:29.360 --> 01:17:34.880]   and adding 30 or 40 years of perspective and learning to how it goes.
[01:17:34.880 --> 01:17:40.360]   And it is the most beautiful, if anybody wants to know about life, I think, listen to this
[01:17:40.360 --> 01:17:41.360]   book.
[01:17:41.360 --> 01:17:44.960]   And this is if you're in your 20s or 30s and 40s and you don't know what the future is
[01:17:44.960 --> 01:17:48.960]   going to hold for you, realize that when you've got another couple of decades on you, you're
[01:17:48.960 --> 01:17:52.240]   going to understand yourself so much better than you do right now.
[01:17:52.240 --> 01:17:54.840]   And this is a case study and that sort of thing.
[01:17:54.840 --> 01:18:01.040]   The first half of it is her reading, her writing something right now about these diaries.
[01:18:01.040 --> 01:18:06.280]   And then the other half of it is an actress with a younger voice reading the actual diaries
[01:18:06.280 --> 01:18:07.280]   themselves.
[01:18:07.280 --> 01:18:12.080]   And so it really is like her co-authoring a memoir with herself from age 19.
[01:18:12.080 --> 01:18:16.120]   She said that in a lot of the interviews that it was a very different person she was reading
[01:18:16.120 --> 01:18:17.120]   these diaries.
[01:18:17.120 --> 01:18:18.600]   Yeah, I can't wait to read this.
[01:18:18.600 --> 01:18:22.840]   Of course, she did a number of interviews just before she died about this, including
[01:18:22.840 --> 01:18:25.120]   Fresh Air and Graham Norton.
[01:18:25.120 --> 01:18:27.040]   So yeah, I'm dying to read this.
[01:18:27.040 --> 01:18:28.040]   Now I was just looking.
[01:18:28.040 --> 01:18:31.760]   One of the things I do with Audible is, and of course I'm doing it with all of the books
[01:18:31.760 --> 01:18:35.360]   you recommend, Danny, I add them to my wish list.
[01:18:35.360 --> 01:18:36.800]   And there's a lot.
[01:18:36.800 --> 01:18:38.560]   I want to read Thomas Friedman's newest.
[01:18:38.560 --> 01:18:43.600]   Thank you for being late and Optimus Sky to thriving in the age of acceleration.
[01:18:43.600 --> 01:18:44.760]   How to live, how to survive.
[01:18:44.760 --> 01:18:45.800]   This is something we often deal with.
[01:18:45.800 --> 01:18:50.200]   How to survive in a world that's moving so very fast.
[01:18:50.200 --> 01:18:52.920]   Friedman is just fantastic.
[01:18:52.920 --> 01:18:56.000]   This one I've been meaning to read Hillbilly Elegy by J.D. Vance.
[01:18:56.000 --> 01:18:58.120]   Michael Lewis is newest.
[01:18:58.120 --> 01:19:00.600]   You can see the case against Sugar by Gary Tobs.
[01:19:00.600 --> 01:19:01.600]   I got to read that.
[01:19:01.600 --> 01:19:03.800]   There's so many good books.
[01:19:03.800 --> 01:19:04.800]   Fiction nonfiction.
[01:19:04.800 --> 01:19:10.920]   Here's the biography of Nikola Tesla, Wizard, and Leonard Schlane, who I love.
[01:19:10.920 --> 01:19:16.480]   He's passed away, of course, but his daughter Tiffany is in charge of the webbies.
[01:19:16.480 --> 01:19:20.080]   He's one of his last books, Leonardo Brain's Understanding Da Vinci's Creative Genius.
[01:19:20.080 --> 01:19:22.960]   You can see I like to mix my fiction with my nonfiction.
[01:19:22.960 --> 01:19:28.080]   I like to learn, but I also like to just kind of escape with Audible.
[01:19:28.080 --> 01:19:29.800]   You can do both.
[01:19:29.800 --> 01:19:35.800]   But first, get your subscription.
[01:19:35.800 --> 01:19:37.080]   Sign up for the gold account.
[01:19:37.080 --> 01:19:38.080]   That's the Book of Month subscription.
[01:19:38.080 --> 01:19:42.160]   It includes the Daily Digest of the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal.
[01:19:42.160 --> 01:19:44.120]   This is something you can't get anywhere else, by the way.
[01:19:44.120 --> 01:19:45.680]   I mean, you mentioned this.
[01:19:45.680 --> 01:19:46.920]   Ponzi Supernova.
[01:19:46.920 --> 01:19:53.960]   It's an original series from Audible where they're talking to Bernie Madoff.
[01:19:53.960 --> 01:19:55.600]   Fascinating.
[01:19:55.600 --> 01:19:59.200]   This is the one was revealed that Madoff has cornered the market and Swiss Miss in
[01:19:59.200 --> 01:20:01.320]   the season.
[01:20:01.320 --> 01:20:07.800]   He's using his entrepreneurial skills to he bought all the Swiss Miss Hot Chocolate from
[01:20:07.800 --> 01:20:15.240]   the Commissary and sells it back at a profit to inmates desperate for a good cup of cocoa.
[01:20:15.240 --> 01:20:16.240]   It's just weird.
[01:20:16.240 --> 01:20:17.240]   It's weird.
[01:20:17.240 --> 01:20:19.280]   That's just weird.
[01:20:19.280 --> 01:20:21.520]   Anyway, Audible.
[01:20:21.520 --> 01:20:22.520]   But this is it.
[01:20:22.520 --> 01:20:25.600]   You wonder sometimes we will say, how do you keep up on everything?
[01:20:25.600 --> 01:20:27.520]   I listen to a lot of audio books.
[01:20:27.520 --> 01:20:30.320]   Oh, a new Neil Gaiman on Norse mythology.
[01:20:30.320 --> 01:20:33.720]   Gotta read that too.
[01:20:33.720 --> 01:20:34.960]   You see my problem.
[01:20:34.960 --> 01:20:36.960]   John Cleese has a new book.

[01:20:40.800 --> 01:20:44.720]   Cancel anytime in the first 30 days you'll pay nothing, although, and by the way, the
[01:20:44.720 --> 01:20:45.880]   book is yours to keep forever.
[01:20:45.880 --> 01:20:49.000]   I have a feeling you may stick around.
[01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:50.000]   Look at this.
[01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:53.640]   An audio book of the elements of style.
[01:20:53.640 --> 01:20:56.000]   That's interesting.
[01:20:56.000 --> 01:21:00.560]   If you're a writer and you haven't read that, you probably should.
[01:21:00.560 --> 01:21:04.360]   There's a lot of books about writing and so forth.
[01:21:04.360 --> 01:21:08.320]   A lot of science fiction, a lot of thrillers, zombie.
[01:21:08.320 --> 01:21:12.200]   Those left behind, zombie fallout 10.
[01:21:12.200 --> 01:21:16.920]   If you're sad, if you want more walking dead, there you go.
[01:21:16.920 --> 01:21:18.320]   A dog's purpose.
[01:21:18.320 --> 01:21:20.440]   Oh, I have to read this.
[01:21:20.440 --> 01:21:25.400]   This is the movie that they decided not to release, or at least to put off the release
[01:21:25.400 --> 01:21:30.440]   of, but I want to read the book about a dog.
[01:21:30.440 --> 01:21:31.440]   Good omens.
[01:21:31.440 --> 01:21:32.440]   We've both read this, Andy.
[01:21:32.440 --> 01:21:33.440]   I know.
[01:21:33.440 --> 01:21:37.680]   Terry Pratchett, Neil Gaiman, they collaborated on a wonderful book.
[01:21:37.680 --> 01:21:39.680]   Anyway, I should go.
[01:21:39.680 --> 01:21:40.680]   I should stop.
[01:21:40.680 --> 01:21:44.600]   But as you can see, I start to get drilled down into Audible and I can't stop.
[01:21:44.600 --> 01:21:51.320]   Learn more at www.rine.com/macbreak, your first book's free, but get ready.
[01:21:51.320 --> 01:21:54.440]   A world of excitement awaits.
[01:21:54.440 --> 01:21:55.440]   Time for a picture of the week.
[01:21:55.440 --> 01:21:58.760]   Let me do Renee Richie in case he has to run because he's got a meeting coming up.
[01:21:58.760 --> 01:22:01.200]   Renee, what's your pick this week?
[01:22:01.200 --> 01:22:02.360]   So I'm going back to basics.
[01:22:02.360 --> 01:22:07.360]   I was recently redoing my studio and a lot of people ask how do I get started with home
[01:22:07.360 --> 01:22:11.240]   automation and often I say, "I just get hue light bulbs" or something, but I realize there's
[01:22:11.240 --> 01:22:14.760]   a really handy thing you can get and it's made by several manufacturers.
[01:22:14.760 --> 01:22:16.680]   I got the iHome Smart Plug.
[01:22:16.680 --> 01:22:17.680]   You can get them from iDevice.
[01:22:17.680 --> 01:22:19.080]   You can get them from Algato.
[01:22:19.080 --> 01:22:23.040]   And all it is is a little plug that you put into your standard outlet and it turns it into
[01:22:23.040 --> 01:22:24.640]   a home kit outlet.
[01:22:24.640 --> 01:22:28.120]   And so for example, I have the hue light bulbs behind me that I can control with Siri and
[01:22:28.120 --> 01:22:30.960]   I can just say on or off or different colors.
[01:22:30.960 --> 01:22:36.480]   But I also have these LED panels here that I use to get flood lighting for podcasting and
[01:22:36.480 --> 01:22:38.960]   they don't have home kit built in.
[01:22:38.960 --> 01:22:43.640]   But if I plug them into home kit, into this plug, all of a sudden I can say, "Turn the
[01:22:43.640 --> 01:22:47.280]   plug on" and because I named the plug a light when I say turn studio lights on, the
[01:22:47.280 --> 01:22:49.240]   plug comes on as well.
[01:22:49.240 --> 01:22:50.360]   And you can do that for anything.
[01:22:50.360 --> 01:22:51.880]   There's common demos for fans.
[01:22:51.880 --> 01:22:55.400]   You could say turn the fan on or you could say, "Turn the kettle on."
[01:22:55.400 --> 01:22:57.840]   There's all sorts of different things that you can plug into it.
[01:22:57.840 --> 01:23:02.720]   But it basically takes any dumb gadget and turns it into at least a relatively smart
[01:23:02.720 --> 01:23:04.240]   esque gadget.
[01:23:04.240 --> 01:23:09.800]   And I have friends who have been doing that with team makers or coffee makers, all sorts
[01:23:09.800 --> 01:23:10.800]   of things.
[01:23:10.800 --> 01:23:15.440]   Anything that basically has an on/off state, a binary state, you attach this to it and
[01:23:15.440 --> 01:23:19.000]   immediately you can control it either with Siri with your voice with the home app if
[01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:20.000]   you can't talk out loud.
[01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:23.640]   It's very easy just to pull up control center, tap on, tap off.
[01:23:23.640 --> 01:23:27.120]   It's almost like clap on, clap off, back in the clapper days.
[01:23:27.120 --> 01:23:28.640]   And it's really, really handy.
[01:23:28.640 --> 01:23:33.640]   And I used it today because my power went out and it was, and I was trying to stay home,
[01:23:33.640 --> 01:23:35.480]   but it was just getting colder and colder.
[01:23:35.480 --> 01:23:39.640]   But I knew if I left, I'd have no real easy way of knowing if the power came back on.
[01:23:39.640 --> 01:23:42.760]   Because I don't have things like answering machines and telephone lines anymore.
[01:23:42.760 --> 01:23:46.200]   But then I realized that if I could see HomeKit, it meant everything was back on.
[01:23:46.200 --> 01:23:49.720]   So I just waited until that lit up and then I pressed the button and turned on and off.
[01:23:49.720 --> 01:23:52.480]   And I drove home and all the power was back on.
[01:23:52.480 --> 01:23:57.360]   So it really sort of brought a lot of gadgets in my house into the smart age well before
[01:23:57.360 --> 01:23:58.360]   their time.
[01:23:58.360 --> 01:24:00.720]   So I bought several more over the last week.
[01:24:00.720 --> 01:24:04.360]   The iHome Smart Plug from iHome Audio.
[01:24:04.360 --> 01:24:07.000]   Yeah, great little edition.
[01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:09.920]   And Drew and Notco, your pick of the week.
[01:24:09.920 --> 01:24:14.520]   This is a really simple but really powerful app for both iOS and Mac OS.
[01:24:14.520 --> 01:24:15.760]   It's called Copied.
[01:24:15.760 --> 01:24:17.440]   It's a clipboard manager.
[01:24:17.440 --> 01:24:23.280]   And it's, instead of having, it basically takes the simplest thing you've been doing
[01:24:23.280 --> 01:24:27.560]   since 1985, you've been using Macs, you just copy something and put it into the clipboard
[01:24:27.560 --> 01:24:33.880]   and turns it from one thing, one slot only to having 500 slots and also being able to
[01:24:33.880 --> 01:24:38.000]   have this little app and this little extension look at what you've just put into the clipboard
[01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:39.600]   and do something with it.
[01:24:39.600 --> 01:24:43.520]   So at the very simplest level, I can do things like, I'm about to leave the house.
[01:24:43.520 --> 01:24:45.400]   Oh, God, what's that address I'm going to need?
[01:24:45.400 --> 01:24:49.120]   I can just simply copy it out of an email, just simply copy.
[01:24:49.120 --> 01:24:55.080]   And then because of device syncing, it will simply appear in the copied app on iOS where
[01:24:55.080 --> 01:25:01.480]   I can see it through a copied app or through a widget, my swiping down from the top.
[01:25:01.480 --> 01:25:04.720]   And it'll just sync all that stuff and I'll have a sort of a history of things that I've
[01:25:04.720 --> 01:25:05.720]   copied.
[01:25:05.720 --> 01:25:13.760]   Or I can do things as sophisticated as for, if I copy something out of Safari, I'm going
[01:25:13.760 --> 01:25:19.600]   to have you please run a JavaScript that I have written that will reformat it into a
[01:25:19.600 --> 01:25:22.080]   different sort of HTML format.
[01:25:22.080 --> 01:25:28.360]   And then send it to another app or I can have it automatically put, categorize and set to
[01:25:28.360 --> 01:25:29.440]   a different list.
[01:25:29.440 --> 01:25:34.000]   It's a little like, you can think of it a little bit like having Evernote or having Google
[01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:36.440]   Keep or any of these other little note taking apps.
[01:25:36.440 --> 01:25:41.520]   But imagine having that integrated come like intimately throughout the iOS experience.
[01:25:41.520 --> 01:25:45.680]   It really is for me, I've had it for the past week or two and it really is the simplest
[01:25:45.680 --> 01:25:47.080]   way to simply, oh, that's important.
[01:25:47.080 --> 01:25:52.160]   I might want to use it later and not only actually saving it, but also being able to
[01:25:52.160 --> 01:25:55.320]   find it and actually use it later on.
[01:25:55.320 --> 01:25:58.720]   It's not as sophisticated as Google Keep or Evernote.
[01:25:58.720 --> 01:26:03.120]   For instance, on the Mac OS version, it will only keep like the last, the clipboard will
[01:26:03.120 --> 01:26:05.080]   only have the last 500 things that you've kept.
[01:26:05.080 --> 01:26:08.080]   So it's not as though you can come back four months later and then you'll still have the
[01:26:08.080 --> 01:26:11.760]   same clipboard unless you do something with it after you do it.
[01:26:11.760 --> 01:26:16.440]   But really useful stuff, eight bucks, which is not a painful amount of money.
[01:26:16.440 --> 01:26:21.640]   And it really gets on my list of things where try it, install it, you will probably in the
[01:26:21.640 --> 01:26:26.600]   next month or so find something that will, a solution for it that will be the perfect
[01:26:26.600 --> 01:26:27.920]   answer to a question.
[01:26:27.920 --> 01:26:29.760]   Very good.
[01:26:29.760 --> 01:26:30.760]   How much?
[01:26:30.760 --> 01:26:31.760]   $7.99.
[01:26:31.760 --> 01:26:34.000]   Sounds worth it.
[01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:36.400]   And I think for that price, you get both the Mac and the iOS version.
[01:26:36.400 --> 01:26:37.400]   Oh, that's great.
[01:26:37.400 --> 01:26:39.400]   You don't have to buy them separately.
[01:26:39.400 --> 01:26:40.400]   Nice.
[01:26:40.400 --> 01:26:41.400]   Copied.
[01:26:41.400 --> 01:26:42.400]   Copicopiedapp.com.
[01:26:42.400 --> 01:26:46.840]   Beautiful implementer.
[01:26:46.840 --> 01:26:49.080]   Renee Ritchie is at imore.com.
[01:26:49.080 --> 01:26:53.040]   You've got to go there for not only all the Apple news, but also all the Apple how to's
[01:26:53.040 --> 01:26:56.320]   and some great podcasts too.
[01:26:56.320 --> 01:26:57.320]   Always a pleasure.
[01:26:57.320 --> 01:26:59.160]   I'm glad the power stayed on for the show.
[01:26:59.160 --> 01:27:00.640]   Yeah, fingers crossed.
[01:27:00.640 --> 01:27:04.320]   Hope it continues to stay on.
[01:27:04.320 --> 01:27:06.080]   And we'll see you next week.
[01:27:06.080 --> 01:27:07.080]   Absolutely.
[01:27:07.080 --> 01:27:09.360]   Andy Inaco is at the Chicago Sun Times.
[01:27:09.360 --> 01:27:13.600]   He is also regular on this show, but we are going to see him soon.
[01:27:13.600 --> 01:27:18.800]   He's coming out for Sal Seguayan's dinner on the 27th and we're going to snag you for
[01:27:18.800 --> 01:27:20.680]   the new screen savers on the 28th.
[01:27:20.680 --> 01:27:22.080]   If you don't mind.
[01:27:22.080 --> 01:27:23.080]   It's going to be absolutely fun.
[01:27:23.080 --> 01:27:24.080]   Can't wait.
[01:27:24.080 --> 01:27:25.800]   Still have the still have the kitchen full of free stacks.
[01:27:25.800 --> 01:27:27.800]   It's a good way to get the studio.
[01:27:27.800 --> 01:27:28.800]   All the snacks you can eat.
[01:27:28.800 --> 01:27:29.800]   Yep.
[01:27:29.800 --> 01:27:30.800]   Oh, okay.
[01:27:30.800 --> 01:27:31.800]   I didn't ask how I can eat.
[01:27:31.800 --> 01:27:32.800]   How about all that I can carry?
[01:27:32.800 --> 01:27:33.800]   Well, okay.
[01:27:33.800 --> 01:27:34.800]   All right.
[01:27:34.800 --> 01:27:35.800]   Okay.
[01:27:35.800 --> 01:27:36.800]   Yeah, we got the nature boxes.
[01:27:36.800 --> 01:27:37.800]   We got all the stuff.
[01:27:37.800 --> 01:27:38.800]   We got it.
[01:27:38.800 --> 01:27:42.560]   You're going to have to understand that at least one bottle of Coke will be leaving the
[01:27:42.560 --> 01:27:43.560]   studio.
[01:27:43.560 --> 01:27:44.560]   That's quite all right.
[01:27:44.560 --> 01:27:47.440]   We always when Andy comes in studio, we always get the Mexican Coke ahead of time.
[01:27:47.440 --> 01:27:48.880]   So we have full supply.
[01:27:48.880 --> 01:27:52.560]   Daddy's magic thinking juice.
[01:27:52.560 --> 01:27:56.040]   And I think if you can stick around for Sunday, we'll talk, of course, off the air.
[01:27:56.040 --> 01:27:57.440]   You don't have to say yes.
[01:27:57.440 --> 01:27:58.680]   I'm putting the pressure on.
[01:27:58.680 --> 01:28:01.320]   But if you stick around for Sunday, we can do twit with you as well.
[01:28:01.320 --> 01:28:02.320]   We'd love to do that.
[01:28:02.320 --> 01:28:03.720]   So anyway, we'll see.
[01:28:03.720 --> 01:28:04.720]   I'm looking forward to it.
[01:28:04.720 --> 01:28:08.360]   We're going to have a nice dinner and catch up on everything that's going on in the Enoch
[01:28:08.360 --> 01:28:09.760]  o world.
[01:28:09.760 --> 01:28:12.000]   How was little Christmas?
[01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:13.000]   Very, very good.
[01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:14.000]   I had my pierogies.
[01:28:14.000 --> 01:28:16.600]   I had my cold, my cold sausage.
[01:28:16.600 --> 01:28:22.280]   It was and that's one of the few things I really love Facebook for because I don't
[01:28:22.280 --> 01:28:23.280]   remember.
[01:28:23.280 --> 01:28:26.800]   I don't know how to say Merry Christmas in Russian or inch in check.
[01:28:26.800 --> 01:28:30.240]   And so it was great to all my all my cousins who know how to say it was.
[01:28:30.240 --> 01:28:31.240]   That's what they're doing.
[01:28:31.240 --> 01:28:32.240]   Oh, great.
[01:28:32.240 --> 01:28:33.240]   Yeah.
[01:28:33.240 --> 01:28:34.240]   Nice.
[01:28:34.240 --> 01:28:35.240]   Back at you.
[01:28:35.240 --> 01:28:36.240]   Nice.
[01:28:36.240 --> 01:28:37.240]   So yes, they do it.
[01:28:37.240 --> 01:28:39.240]   There are a lot of like diet critical.
[01:28:39.240 --> 01:28:40.920]   Oh, yeah, that's a check.
[01:28:40.920 --> 01:28:41.920]   Yeah.
[01:28:41.920 --> 01:28:42.920]   Awesome.
[01:28:42.920 --> 01:28:44.800]   The day after took down my Christmas decorations, that's the other great thing about Little
[01:28:44.800 --> 01:28:45.800]   Christmas.
[01:28:45.800 --> 01:28:49.560]   You know that, okay, after the day after Little Christmas is when I take down the Happy Halloween
[01:28:49.560 --> 01:28:53.600]   placard off my front door and I take down the Christmas tree full of sci-fi Halloween
[01:28:53.600 --> 01:28:54.600]   or words.
[01:28:54.600 --> 01:28:58.040]   They had sci-fi Halloween ornaments?
[01:28:58.040 --> 01:29:00.520]   Yeah, it's not a big tree.
[01:29:00.520 --> 01:29:07.000]   And so year after year after year, and I used to just basically sort of co-opt my parents
[01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:09.360]   Christmas tree because I was decorating their tree.
[01:29:09.360 --> 01:29:15.000]   And since like, you know, and now basically the my collection of hallmark ornaments have
[01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:16.000]   now taken over everything.
[01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:20.360]   There's no room on my tree for anything other than like Star Trek and Star Wars ornaments.
[01:29:20.360 --> 01:29:21.360]   So nice.
[01:29:21.360 --> 01:29:23.880]   And also I bought some Aida fruit stuff.
[01:29:23.880 --> 01:29:29.160]   And now I have some, now I think those smart ornaments that also give me notifications.
[01:29:29.160 --> 01:29:30.160]   Nice.
