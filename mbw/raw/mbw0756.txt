[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.480]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly Renee and Alex are all here.
[00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:06.800]   And of course, we're going to talk about an Apple event.
[00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:09.200]   It looks like we've got a date.
[00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:12.080]   We also have a pretty good idea of what Apple might announce.
[00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:13.080]   We'll go through that.
[00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.320]   And what happened to the iMac Pro and what's going to replace it?
[00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.920]   It's all coming up next on Mac Break Weekly.

[00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:35.840]   This show we cover the latest news from Apple.
[00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:37.840]   We've got the panel here.
[00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:38.840]   They're all here.
[00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:41.840]   Renee Richie from youtube.com/ReneeRitchie.
[00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:42.840]   Hi Renee.
[00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:47.400]   Hey Leo, I'm hoping we have no news because those are always the best shows.
[00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:50.240]   I think it's a slow news, not no news.
[00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:51.240]   Awesome.
[00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:52.240]   Yeah.
[00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:53.240]   Awesome.
[00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:55.560]   Because I think we're going to have a lot of news sometime this month.
[00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.120]   We'll talk about that in just a little bit.
[00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:59.520]   I mean I think that's a safe bet.
[00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.120]   We don't know exactly when but we'll talk about that bit also.
[00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:06.880]   And not co from WGBH in Boston and on notco.com.
[00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:07.880]   Hello Andrew.
[00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:08.880]   Hello.
[00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:15.040]   You know that it's a slow week when even like the rumor people are saying yeah in the
[00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:18.760]   2030s Apple is going to be releasing contact lines.
[00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:19.760]   2030s.
[00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:20.760]   2030s now.
[00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:21.760]   Wow.
[00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:25.320]   I saw you look at my board.
[00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:27.240]   That's a little far off.
[00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:31.120]   Also Alex Lindsey from office hours and 090.media.
[00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:32.120]   Hello Alex.
[00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:33.120]   Hello.
[00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:34.120]   Hello.
[00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:35.120]   From office hours.
[00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:36.120]   Is that okay if I say that?
[00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:37.120]   Yeah sure.
[00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:38.120]   That's good.
[00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:39.120]   It's a big chunk of big chunk of my day.
[00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:44.000]   These devote hours every day to a free zoom session.
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.920]   You can watch a bit of it on YouTube because they record a bit of it but really the whole
[00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:49.120]   thing you have to be there for which I think is smart.
[00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:50.520]   That's the clubhouse way.
[00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:52.520]   You have to be there for it.
[00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:55.040]   I saw the office hours at night.
[00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:56.040]   Is that a new thing Alex?
[00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:58.800]   There's like multiple times a day now you can office hours?
[00:02:58.800 --> 00:02:59.800]   Yeah.
[00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:05.000]   Monday to my wife's sugar in Monday at six we open up.
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.200]   We had a lot of folks that were on the other side of the world and some folks that just
[00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:10.960]   this is the middle of the day for them when we do the morning one.
[00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:13.160]   And so there was a lot of requests to go into the evening.
[00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:17.680]   And so for one day a week on on Mondays we do an evening show which is a lot of fun.
[00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:24.520]   We had a lot of fun last night and then we do a clubhouse on Wednesdays at seven.
[00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:29.160]   And so anyway so those are the two evening shows and the rest of them are all morning.
[00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:33.280]   Although they're getting pretty Saturday is the long day.
[00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:37.320]   So we start I mean the first hours at five a.m.
[00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:41.360]   And on this Saturday I think we're going to end up finishing about three or four in the
[00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:45.640]   afternoon because we're doing like Saturday is a good example.
[00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:49.320]   We do a special hour on education or two hours on education.
[00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:52.200]   We have a lot of educators that come in and talk about you know what's working not working
[00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:54.320]   in the current COVID situation.
[00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:59.080]   And then we have a resolve training at 10 which is free which is free.
[00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:02.200]   Ten to 11 and there's a little bit of a break and then at noon we're all going to build
[00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:04.760]   a play out system out of a Raspberry Pi.
[00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:08.120]   So everyone just everyone's buying Raspberry Pi's and we're all just going to sit around.
[00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:11.160]   We're going to sit around on zoom and figure out like.
[00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:16.800]   It's you know I think most a lot of people in office hours say that we're all learning
[00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:18.360]   faster than we have in a long.
[00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:20.320]   It's really it's university.
[00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:25.480]   I suppose I should hang out in there and learn things about after all this is my business
[00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:27.440]   is doing this but I.
[00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:30.400]   Oh no Leo Leo don't don't you'll become one of them.
[00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:36.640]   I'm starting to consider what's what's what's what's I think I think that if this if this
[00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:41.560]   curve continues to go up you're going to hit that point where the phrase I can't believe
[00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:46.440]   that you spent time with your family when you knew that we had office hours at 3am on
[00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:47.440]   a Saturday night.
[00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:51.280]   It was all Alex's fault all Alex's fault all along.
[00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:56.560]   Oh, there's your loyalty as the song goes.
[00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:01.200]   It's a telephone you're starting you're starting a telethon.
[00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:08.960]   iOS 14.4.1 I bet you Apple did not want to release this given that 14.5 is probably just
[00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:18.480]   around the corner but they had to Mac OS 11.2.3 addressing a WebKit vulnerability.
[00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:23.680]   I guess a fairly serious WebKit vulnerability WebKit of course powers Safari which means
[00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:30.400]   it powers every time you go web browsing or even read HTML email WebKit is rendering it.
[00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:37.480]   The vulnerability was discovered by security researchers from Google and Microsoft.
[00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:39.080]   You know I bet you it's hard for Apple.
[00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:40.560]   Last time Project Zero had.
[00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:46.360]   They want to say thank you but at the same time it's like thank you.
[00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:51.880]   It may have allowed bad actors apparently Nicholas Cage is in there I don't know to execute
[00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:53.200]   code on your devices.
[00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:55.600]   I know that's bad I know.
[00:05:55.600 --> 00:06:06.080]   He was working with Martin Scorsese and also Valley Ghost Rider II is an under appreciated
[00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:07.080]   not unappreciated.
[00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:08.640]   He's just made some bad choices.
[00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:10.120]   He got his financial trouble.
[00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:13.800]   I like his weird choices.
[00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:16.280]   He's not a bad actor he's just different.
[00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:18.760]   We got to superman bullet Nicholas Cage.
[00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:22.280]   I'm not a bad.
[00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:26.600]   They have allowed bad actors to execute code on your devices using maliciously crafted
[00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:27.600]   web content.
[00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:32.640]   That's really really dangerous because as I said web content is everywhere even in your
[00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:34.080]   email.
[00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:41.320]   So update if you haven't already updated whenever you see these update.
[00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:45.720]   Apple did not really say clearly what this was all about right.
[00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:49.920]   It's one of those tensions though like right now they're putting blast door into iMessage
[00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:55.520]   because it's become more important to disassemble all the payloads before we ever see them.
[00:06:55.520 --> 00:07:00.000]   But for a decade all we've heard about is how important speed is on web browsers.
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.480]   How just in time compilers have to be faster.
[00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:06.480]   They have to start doing like I think on Windows for a while they were actually executing
[00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:10.480]   stuff in the data space to save time not having to transfer it back and forth and we saw how
[00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:11.720]   that worked out.
[00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:14.920]   So I think we'll get to a point where there's a reckoning where we have to start understanding
[00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:17.760]   the security implications of all that speed to render.
[00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:24.360]   So Safari was updated Mac OS big sir was updated watch OS was updated.
[00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:33.400]   Wow and iOS all the things just shows you how how many dependencies there are in the
[00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:34.400]   Mac.
[00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:39.600]   It's all one code base and it does keep expressing it in different devices.
[00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:40.600]   WebKit is omnipress.
[00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:43.480]   And it's good and bad because they're all vulnerable but then they all get fixed.
[00:07:43.480 --> 00:07:44.480]   They're all patchable.
[00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:47.800]   Otherwise they wouldn't all be vulnerable but maybe they all wouldn't get fixed.
[00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:49.480]   We're more work to fix them this way.
[00:07:49.480 --> 00:07:51.040]   They all get hit but they all get fixed.
[00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:55.360]   So if you're on big sir there'll be a OS update if you're on Catalina or Mojave there'll
[00:07:55.360 --> 00:07:58.520]   be a Safari update and that should be I guess sufficient.
[00:07:58.520 --> 00:08:02.440]   I don't you know it's one of those things where Apple kind of talks about it but that
[00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:03.800]   kind of doesn't want to talk about it.
[00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:09.800]   So that's anyway whenever there's a security update like this especially this close to
[00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:14.200]   14 5 I think it means this is serious.
[00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:19.000]   I think they use Safari and QuickTime as a way to update the like the foundation of the
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:22.080]   Opera system as well out of bands without having to do a whole update.
[00:08:22.080 --> 00:08:25.440]   They can still go in and fix Safari and that fixes all the WebKit rendering or QuickTime
[00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:27.480]   and that fixes all the core foundation.
[00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:28.480]   That makes sense.
[00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:30.200]   Yeah that makes sense.
[00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:35.360]   So WebKit even though it's a library external library updating Safari really is updating
[00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:38.920]   WebKit and so you're fixing you're fixing whatever is going on.
[00:08:38.920 --> 00:08:47.600]   So alert alert warning will Robinson danger danger just do it.
[00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:54.480]   So we are coming close to 14 5 I presume that's going to be part of whatever is this announcement
[00:08:54.480 --> 00:08:57.120]   in March.
[00:08:57.120 --> 00:09:02.720]   The leaker that suggested first there was a leaker that suggested March 16th we next
[00:09:02.720 --> 00:09:08.400]   Tuesday which we completely took apart last week.
[00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:14.680]   Now the latest and this comes from a reputable Chinese leaker according to Mac.
[00:09:14.680 --> 00:09:17.520]   He's a leaker how going to be reputable.
[00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:23.680]   Dwan Ruwee he's like he's like 97% accurate because he only talks like three days before
[00:09:23.680 --> 00:09:28.880]   something happens but it's all I think it's 97% happens he waits or she waits and then
[00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:34.480]   just I figure they just look at the trucks coming off of Hanay or Fox Con or something
[00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:37.360]   writes it down and then puts it on Weibo.
[00:09:37.360 --> 00:09:42.240]   So he he tweets it seems among other things he talks about the one plus nine new product
[00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:47.280]   launch event and the Apple event are held the same day and he's saying March 23rd to
[00:09:47.280 --> 00:09:52.960]   which John Prosser another pretty reliable guy says yep hearing the same thing didn't
[00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:57.920]   know about the one plus event though ha ha nobody's gonna know about the one plus event
[00:09:57.920 --> 00:10:00.840]   if Apple's doing it at the same time.
[00:10:00.840 --> 00:10:04.040]   So but this is an app you probably didn't know about the one plus event.
[00:10:04.040 --> 00:10:09.520]   This isn't too much of a surprise I mean we kind of expected something in March and so
[00:10:09.520 --> 00:10:14.760]   there's only it could be next Tuesday the Tuesday after the Tuesday after that.
[00:10:14.760 --> 00:10:19.720]   So yep one and three right I mean there or could it be that there's no event in March
[00:10:19.720 --> 00:10:20.720]   at all.
[00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:24.240]   There are too many things in the hopper at this point I'd be very surprised we didn't
[00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:25.520]   see something very very shortly.
[00:10:25.520 --> 00:10:27.480]   You want to unclog the hopper.
[00:10:27.480 --> 00:10:30.200]   No one wants to walk around with a clog hopper.
[00:10:30.200 --> 00:10:31.200]   Show title.
[00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:37.640]   He just wrote 23 in a tweet a while ago and one thing I always like say like like John
[00:10:37.640 --> 00:10:40.280]   Prosser and the people they aren't leakers like the leakers are in the company their
[00:10:40.280 --> 00:10:44.000]   reporters they report on on the information that they're given but there's become like
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:47.400]   this weird culture around calling somebody a leaker which has led to a bunch of fake
[00:10:47.400 --> 00:10:50.480]   anonymous leakers so I try to tamp that down whenever I see it.
[00:10:50.480 --> 00:10:51.480]   Oh that's a good point.
[00:10:51.480 --> 00:10:55.480]   So Prosser's reporter for a front page tech he's reporting on the leaks that he's gotten
[00:10:55.480 --> 00:11:00.800]   which says a 23rd and also I think he said four products are ready they may not all be
[00:11:00.800 --> 00:11:04.640]   in the event some might be press released or come out around the event but there's four
[00:11:04.640 --> 00:11:06.560]   products that are good to go for the event.
[00:11:06.560 --> 00:11:14.280]   He says air tags iPad Pro AirPods and a new Apple TV which is all of which we've kind
[00:11:14.280 --> 00:11:17.360]   of been hearing especially air tanks.
[00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:19.880]   You hear it about for a while.
[00:11:19.880 --> 00:11:23.000]   They forgot to put the air tags on the air tags Leo so they could not find the air tags
[00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:24.000]   they lost the air tags.
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:28.600]   How long have we been talking about air tags been like two years of air tags like forever.
[00:11:28.600 --> 00:11:30.160]   September 2019.
[00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:35.280]   So wow it's so it is it's it's coming on two years this September but it's so a year
[00:11:35.280 --> 00:11:36.280]   and a half.
[00:11:36.280 --> 00:11:42.320]   So air tags what do we know about air tags I mean I think of them as like tile the Bluetooth
[00:11:42.320 --> 00:11:49.240]   tracker but in this case it will use features that are unique to the iPhone especially the
[00:11:49.240 --> 00:11:52.840]   ultra wide band chip that allows you to aim the iPhone.
[00:11:52.840 --> 00:11:58.400]   I think it ultra wide band provides a much more accuracy than Bluetooth so you're going
[00:11:58.400 --> 00:12:03.480]   to be able to theoretically you know get pinpoint the area there.
[00:12:03.480 --> 00:12:08.200]   There's questions about whether you can use I think some of the rumors have been talking
[00:12:08.200 --> 00:12:13.400]   about you know IDs through your phone.
[00:12:13.400 --> 00:12:17.400]   Look up and see like an air like an AR like an AR like a looking like this.
[00:12:17.400 --> 00:12:19.840]   I get an AR picture of my wristwatch.
[00:12:19.840 --> 00:12:20.840]   Where it is.
[00:12:20.840 --> 00:12:24.920]   Yeah like it's over there you know that kind of thing.
[00:12:24.920 --> 00:12:28.200]   What's really interesting and I don't know what will happen with it is whether the
[00:12:28.200 --> 00:12:34.880]   there'll be kind of an infrastructural support for ultra wide band where you know like a
[00:12:34.880 --> 00:12:41.200]   convention center or an arena not that it's at that useful right now but could install
[00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:44.960]   these so that if you if you decide you want to look for something you could be very very
[00:12:44.960 --> 00:12:50.360]   accurate and you could figure out like simple things like where's the bathroom.
[00:12:50.360 --> 00:12:52.360]   You know where's the hot dogs.
[00:12:52.360 --> 00:12:56.080]   You know and part of that becomes also when I really know where you are and I really know
[00:12:56.080 --> 00:12:57.580]   what you want.
[00:12:57.580 --> 00:13:00.580]   You know again when we get back to a point where we're using arenas and stadiums and
[00:13:00.580 --> 00:13:01.580]   everything else.
[00:13:01.580 --> 00:13:06.940]   Being able to load balance users to the you know to the right concessions is not a trivial
[00:13:06.940 --> 00:13:07.940]   thing.
[00:13:07.940 --> 00:13:11.880]   You know being able to say I want to because right now there's you know you want to the
[00:13:11.880 --> 00:13:14.680]   one of the reasons people don't buy things is because it's going to be a long line and
[00:13:14.680 --> 00:13:18.280]   so if you can tell them where to go where there won't be a long line or better yet just
[00:13:18.280 --> 00:13:19.880]   deliver it to them.
[00:13:19.880 --> 00:13:23.360]   So if you look at some new arenas they'll have they'll deliver it to you but it's because
[00:13:23.360 --> 00:13:27.980]   they know what seat you are in you know because you ordered it on you know you bought the
[00:13:27.980 --> 00:13:32.900]   you manage the ticket in your phone so they know that you're in J18 and J19 so when you
[00:13:32.900 --> 00:13:37.420]   order something like at the Golden One Arena and cool well that's already exists.
[00:13:37.420 --> 00:13:41.900]   The problem is is that so that exists now so if you go to Golden One Arena and Sacramento.
[00:13:41.900 --> 00:13:44.660]   I assure anymore you just follow your phone.
[00:13:44.660 --> 00:13:48.740]   Well they yeah that's the whole thing is right now they know what seat to take it to with
[00:13:48.740 --> 00:13:53.100]   ultra wideband they could they know where to take it to and so so you can imagine being
[00:13:53.100 --> 00:13:59.600]   able to let's say I mean with this kind of accuracy you could get to a point where you
[00:13:59.600 --> 00:14:04.080]   could order a beer at Coachella someone would bring it to you.
[00:14:04.080 --> 00:14:09.140]   Like they could find you they could find you know like they would just go you say I want
[00:14:09.140 --> 00:14:13.540]   a beer and to say where you are you just they follow the air and there's an awful lot of
[00:14:13.540 --> 00:14:17.000]   people that would pay three dollars for that you know like three extra dollars on top of
[00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:21.000]   the beer so that I didn't have to go wandering around stand in line do all those other things
[00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:25.740]   and so you know ordering a beer in the stadium or a big shopping center somewhere drop it
[00:14:25.740 --> 00:14:29.360]   with this install you would I think it's well privacy stuff though is what apples kind
[00:14:29.360 --> 00:14:33.520]   of engine here like we've had tiles Samsung has their smart tags now but a lot of this
[00:14:33.520 --> 00:14:37.480]   stuff like immediately when Apple becomes involved it's Wall Street Journal headlines about Apple
[00:14:37.480 --> 00:14:42.400]   create stock or technology and I think a lot of what we're seeing both with how they announced
[00:14:42.400 --> 00:14:47.680]   find my how they announced the API like the so the SDK so that other people can make find
[00:14:47.680 --> 00:14:52.440]   my devices not just Apple so it's not like a an Apple only story and now we just saw
[00:14:52.440 --> 00:14:57.840]   iOS 14.5 a pop up that'll warn you that they have there has an unknown device that
[00:14:57.840 --> 00:15:01.520]   could track you on you I think they're yeah well no but I mean there's a lot of really
[00:15:01.520 --> 00:15:07.200]   interesting technologies here like the with the basic way it works is you and you enlist
[00:15:07.200 --> 00:15:10.520]   the advice on your Apple ID and then it's recorded on Apple's cloud but Apple doesn't
[00:15:10.520 --> 00:15:14.160]   know it's your device it's just an entry on the cloud and then as you're walking around
[00:15:14.160 --> 00:15:19.280]   if you detect the device it'll alert if that device is in a file like a find my state it'll
[00:15:19.280 --> 00:15:23.680]   alert Apple but it won't tell them what your device is it'll have the location but not associated
[00:15:23.680 --> 00:15:28.200]   with your device won't say the device you're found it'll just put the ID in a lookup table
[00:15:28.200 --> 00:15:32.760]   and then if you log into iCloud to find your device it'll match your ID to the lookup table
[00:15:32.760 --> 00:15:37.280]   and you'll know where it is but without knowing who found it like there's all these protections
[00:15:37.280 --> 00:15:42.280]   in place to make it not a stalker technology but I'm still 100% convinced that will be
[00:15:42.280 --> 00:15:45.480]   every headline as soon as it's rolled out well and there's but there's and again I think
[00:15:45.480 --> 00:15:49.320]   a bunch of there's a there's also a bunch of really really deeper things that Apple put
[00:15:49.320 --> 00:15:54.320]   in there like this isn't there like last was it last year just a few months ago that they
[00:15:54.320 --> 00:16:01.440]   have a a feature of find my that could basically say that it sees Bluetooth devices that are
[00:16:01.440 --> 00:16:04.840]   around you and if it notices hey there's a Bluetooth device that seems to be following
[00:16:04.840 --> 00:16:09.880]   you around this is it will like flag it for you and let you know that they're that that
[00:16:09.880 --> 00:16:14.440]   could be another like anti stalker technology it's it's gonna be interesting to see how they
[00:16:14.440 --> 00:16:18.720]   balance not only the privacy stuff but also to see how far they can leverage that privacy
[00:16:18.720 --> 00:16:23.880]   to get people to trust air tags the way that they may not necessarily trust the tile will
[00:16:23.880 --> 00:16:29.120]   they be able to say by the way if you saw this if you if you saw this into the backpack
[00:16:29.120 --> 00:16:33.340]   of your kid of your of your six seven eight nine year old it will make sure that you and
[00:16:33.340 --> 00:16:38.320]   only you can locate that backpack and locate that kid but nobody who's not authorized to
[00:16:38.320 --> 00:16:41.880]   track that tag could possibly it's and that's going to be the sort of stuff they can only
[00:16:41.880 --> 00:16:47.200]   leverage if they if they just as Renee says make that case that we are not like any other
[00:16:47.200 --> 00:16:52.240]   company we are privacy first this is not something we decided to add on to the feature later on
[00:16:52.240 --> 00:16:55.600]   after we designed the eel one chip after we designed all this other stuff we started
[00:16:55.600 --> 00:17:00.160]   from the ground up for the idea that nobody else but you should be able to track items
[00:17:00.160 --> 00:17:03.400]   that's on that that's attached to that as such a with that chip.
[00:17:03.400 --> 00:17:08.960]   There's a lot of people are worried there's like a bluetooth signal coming off your kid
[00:17:08.960 --> 00:17:12.880]   and someone walking around like people used to walk around looking for RFID and passports
[00:17:12.880 --> 00:17:17.040]   or on credit cards or things like that might just start looking for bluetooth and how many
[00:17:17.040 --> 00:17:22.240]   bluetooth signals do you need in one place for them to be sufficiently you abstracted
[00:17:22.240 --> 00:17:25.720]   away from any one person and then if you're alone in a field there's no one around to
[00:17:25.720 --> 00:17:29.360]   track you but you're the only there's so many complexities here that I'm really curious
[00:17:29.360 --> 00:17:31.440]   how it's going to play out.
[00:17:31.440 --> 00:17:35.920]   And I think that's why it's so important in such a key part of Apple's business model
[00:17:35.920 --> 00:17:40.000]   is privacy that they're going to think through those things they're going to think hard about
[00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:43.600]   them because they're not trying to leverage that any other way they just want it to be
[00:17:43.600 --> 00:17:48.440]   convenient for you to you know your device to work really well and they're not interested
[00:17:48.440 --> 00:17:53.160]   in selling you anything or selling your data or selling you know there that that's not where
[00:17:53.160 --> 00:17:57.920]   they're coming from and I think that's why a lot of people may trust it more than more
[00:17:57.920 --> 00:18:02.160]   than many of the other ones that are selling all that data and so I think you know and
[00:18:02.160 --> 00:18:09.020]   because once you go over the idea of I can trust Apple to do this or I can trust the
[00:18:09.020 --> 00:18:14.080]   process there's there are a lot of great things you can do to make things more convenient
[00:18:14.080 --> 00:18:19.040]   when you're at a tourist site to find back to find your you know the next restaurant
[00:18:19.040 --> 00:18:22.800]   to find the place you're going to find each other I mean the thing you see again if you
[00:18:22.800 --> 00:18:26.640]   go I work I've worked at a lot of festivals and when the number one thing you see people
[00:18:26.640 --> 00:18:30.400]   doing is trying to find each other they're all waving their head I'm over here yeah so
[00:18:30.400 --> 00:18:34.720]   that all goes away if you have if if ultra wideband is and you trust it enough and you
[00:18:34.720 --> 00:18:40.400]   decide that that's going to be okay that that literally just disappears you know and and
[00:18:40.400 --> 00:18:46.200]   for parents I'm you know I've had a moment where I lost my son at the California science
[00:18:46.200 --> 00:18:52.320]   the worst ever feeling right it's just it was funny my my my mother there was there there
[00:18:52.320 --> 00:18:56.040]   could have been like a you know when that happened this is when my son was like three
[00:18:56.040 --> 00:19:01.560]   years old my my wife puts out a shriek that I think is a an instinctual shriek that attracts
[00:19:01.560 --> 00:19:05.920]   all the other mothers like it was like this is like this is like a tradition of the bodies
[00:19:05.920 --> 00:19:11.120]   suddenly there were like there were like 12 there were like 12 mothers coming immediately
[00:19:11.120 --> 00:19:15.440]   dispersed they immediately knew it was they got opposite they were given an image they
[00:19:15.440 --> 00:19:19.640]   were given an image on the iPhone and then they dispersed and he was found in like 90
[00:19:19.640 --> 00:19:23.800]   seconds you know like it was but it was like 90 seconds it felt like it was years I wish
[00:19:23.800 --> 00:19:27.640]   I know that because I lost Abby at Legoland and I didn't know to make the mother's screen
[00:19:27.640 --> 00:19:31.400]   you got us because men are not capable of it it's only mothers that can give that could
[00:19:31.400 --> 00:19:37.800]   you do the do the screen I saw that's inside that's for sure so the but but the thing is
[00:19:37.800 --> 00:19:43.760]   is that if you think about those kinds of things that being able to find your kids being able
[00:19:43.760 --> 00:19:46.880]   to find other people that you're just trying to meet being able to find where you're trying
[00:19:46.880 --> 00:19:51.640]   to get to and then also just creating entire experiences over top of it I mean when people
[00:19:51.640 --> 00:19:55.320]   come in early for a concert there could be all kinds of games and other things that are
[00:19:55.320 --> 00:20:00.200]   living in the virtual world that have nothing to do with you know that you can play and enjoy
[00:20:00.200 --> 00:20:05.320]   before you even got to the concert that are all mapped onto the walls and mapped onto
[00:20:05.320 --> 00:20:11.960]   things but we need to know where you are we need to be able to reduce the what part of
[00:20:11.960 --> 00:20:17.040]   the database we have to search to figure out the 3d representation of that and that's where
[00:20:17.040 --> 00:20:21.000]   the light outcomes in and then we can start mapping things onto it and so there's a lot
[00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:28.840]   of really interesting things that are slowly coming together so do we I mean how much do
[00:20:28.840 --> 00:20:33.280]   we know Renee about these do we know what they look like do we know the size do we know
[00:20:33.280 --> 00:20:39.200]   if they use I mean depending on me as well as UWB Bluetooth light or what yeah I mean
[00:20:39.200 --> 00:20:42.800]   depending on how accurate the leaks have been we either know a lot or we mistakenly think
[00:20:42.800 --> 00:20:46.480]   we know a lot but if we trust if we trust everything like if we go with all of these
[00:20:46.480 --> 00:20:51.600]   leaks being accurate there may be two sizes but there sounds like there's going to be
[00:20:51.600 --> 00:20:56.080]   one that's roughly the size of a bottle cap or a quarter that actually has you'd ultra
[00:20:56.080 --> 00:20:59.800]   wide band and Bluetooth LE at least at one point was engraved on it and I don't know
[00:20:59.800 --> 00:21:03.600]   I don't ever want to own anything from Apple that has oh I remember that picture yeah
[00:21:03.600 --> 00:21:08.600]   yeah yes yeah so that that I'm hoping is a hard out but yeah and the find my network
[00:21:08.600 --> 00:21:14.520]   was announced at WWDC 2019 I mean so we're coming up on two years on that and the technology
[00:21:14.520 --> 00:21:18.080]   Apple's in a really good job documenting at least a high level of the technology in their
[00:21:18.080 --> 00:21:23.480]   security white papers and it looks really really robust so again I know there's going
[00:21:23.480 --> 00:21:26.240]   to be headlines I know they're going to be dragged across the internet that is good I
[00:21:26.240 --> 00:21:29.520]   want this stuff hammered I want to know everything about it and if there is any vulnerabilities
[00:21:29.520 --> 00:21:34.280]   I want them fixed but I think the underlying technology certainly seems really like privacy
[00:21:34.280 --> 00:21:40.560]   by designed and that makes me what's the hold up there was two initially so it first came
[00:21:40.560 --> 00:21:45.560]   out I think they might have been slightly worried about the ongoing antitrust issues
[00:21:45.560 --> 00:21:49.440]   because tile was one of the companies that was making those accusations but and so they
[00:21:49.440 --> 00:21:54.800]   announced yeah so they announced that fine might would be open for anybody to use so
[00:21:54.800 --> 00:21:57.960]   instead of being anti-competitive it's now hugely competitive but probably mostly for
[00:21:57.960 --> 00:22:01.840]   tile which is sort of like be careful what you wish for and then the other one I think
[00:22:01.840 --> 00:22:05.920]   they were worried that with the pandemic we wouldn't be a useful product it wouldn't
[00:22:05.920 --> 00:22:10.840]   sell well because we're not going out and losing things the way we might like I'm still
[00:22:10.840 --> 00:22:15.120]   I've used tile I've looked at the Samsung stuff I don't know how much I'll end up using
[00:22:15.120 --> 00:22:19.480]   them my like intellectually I'm happy they exist practically I don't know how much we're
[00:22:19.480 --> 00:22:22.800]   all going to end up using them I think Apple wanted to wait until we were going outside
[00:22:22.800 --> 00:22:29.440]   again before they made them like a sellable product I I have a tile on my on my car keys
[00:22:29.440 --> 00:22:34.920]   yeah and I use it about once a month yeah I will buy a ton of these air techs so one
[00:22:34.920 --> 00:22:40.920]   thing we do know for sure these are in this is in the beta of 14 5 right these images
[00:22:40.920 --> 00:22:47.200]   yeah keep track of your everyday items tag your everyday items with B 389 and never lose
[00:22:47.200 --> 00:22:55.840]   them again add B 389 this is in the fine my app obviously B 389 yeah beacon yeah maybe
[00:22:55.840 --> 00:22:59.440]   it's a beacon but it will be replaced when this comes out with probably the word air
[00:22:59.440 --> 00:23:04.600]   tags but or a tag or something maybe beacon it's interesting they didn't hide this better
[00:23:04.600 --> 00:23:07.760]   because like sometimes they've accidentally not hidden things like there's there's little
[00:23:07.760 --> 00:23:11.920]   flags they can set to hide these things and not have them go out into the beta builds
[00:23:11.920 --> 00:23:15.160]   and this is one of those few times where I wonder if they're like there's going to be
[00:23:15.160 --> 00:23:19.000]   so much rigmarole around this we're going to just slowly start seeding it so that a
[00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:23.400]   lot of the rigmarole gets handled before the before this stuff comes out there's also
[00:23:23.400 --> 00:23:29.880]   a joint our turns hands now so yeah before there's also some weird code that if you lose
[00:23:29.880 --> 00:23:34.480]   an item say you say you put an air tag on your keys you get a notification on your phone
[00:23:34.480 --> 00:23:38.680]   you could tap a button in the fine my app that'll cause the air tag to chime loudly the
[00:23:38.680 --> 00:23:42.320]   trackers used to do that I don't know about tiles but trackers would do that it also
[00:23:42.320 --> 00:23:46.960]   appears augmented reality this is from Mac rumors will play a role in tracking down light
[00:23:46.960 --> 00:23:53.720]   lost items the fine my app might include an AR kit feature so this is the image that's
[00:23:53.720 --> 00:23:59.160]   in I think that's in 14 5 of two balloons there's a string of code it may be that may
[00:23:59.160 --> 00:24:03.840]   be made up because it may just be based on the string of code in iOS 13 that says walk
[00:24:03.840 --> 00:24:09.080]   around several feet and move your iPhone up and down until a balloon comes into view
[00:24:09.080 --> 00:24:13.600]   maybe they don't look like these balloons that might just be Mac rumors fanciful well
[00:24:13.600 --> 00:24:17.080]   and and the thing is because the because these these beacons are a lot more accurate than
[00:24:17.080 --> 00:24:21.040]   Bluetooth you know Bluetooth it can be is typically in kind of the three to five feet
[00:24:21.040 --> 00:24:26.160]   range these are much less than a foot and so you know they can really guide you into
[00:24:26.160 --> 00:24:31.160]   exactly where you need to find something they don't have to be because they're actually
[00:24:31.160 --> 00:24:36.000]   accurate enough to give you a balloon or an arrow or or something that is pretty darn
[00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:40.280]   accurate you know that's really cool yeah because it's in this gets in the couch and
[00:24:40.280 --> 00:24:44.440]   is you and the Apple TV yes if the Apple TV controller does not have a u1 chip in it
[00:24:44.440 --> 00:24:49.160]   I the new one I'm gonna flip a table oh my gosh things so all way to and it's like and
[00:24:49.160 --> 00:24:55.960]   I just need AR to tell me where it is oh my gosh I think it's I think it's I'm good I
[00:24:55.960 --> 00:24:59.240]   think it's very very telling that all the rumors we've been hearing about the ear tags
[00:24:59.240 --> 00:25:03.120]   none of them indicate that there's any kind of a little peeper in it to make noise that
[00:25:03.120 --> 00:25:07.880]   indicates that Apple's very very confident that if the location of that pin points for
[00:25:07.880 --> 00:25:11.920]   you is going to be so good that doesn't necessarily have to make noise or vibrate I
[00:25:11.920 --> 00:25:17.560]   think it does make noise it does yeah yeah that's what the rumor I just read said so
[00:25:17.560 --> 00:25:22.640]   well who you know no one really freaking knows one of the problems with Bluetooth trackers
[00:25:22.640 --> 00:25:27.080]   is Bluetooth itself is only you know is I mean I think Bluetooth 5 now has a longer
[00:25:27.080 --> 00:25:32.120]   range but it's still just you know 100 meters or 150 meters so this is what Mac rumor says
[00:25:32.120 --> 00:25:36.640]   based on code found in iOS if you lose an item that has an air tag on it you'll get a notification
[00:25:36.640 --> 00:25:40.560]   on your iPhone then you'll be able to tap a button in the fine mode I already did that
[00:25:40.560 --> 00:25:45.720]   one this is the one if your item is not nearby in other words not within Bluetooth range
[00:25:45.720 --> 00:25:50.040]   and can't be located you put it into lost mode this is how other Bluetooth trackers
[00:25:50.040 --> 00:25:55.720]   are as well in this mode of another iPhone user this is what's different if you're using
[00:25:55.720 --> 00:26:01.240]   tracker or tile it has to be another tile or tracker user and this is why tiles pissed
[00:26:01.240 --> 00:26:08.480]   off any iPhone user of which there are a billion comes across the item you'll be able to they'll
[00:26:08.480 --> 00:26:13.360]   be able to see your contact information so that they can send you a text or give you
[00:26:13.360 --> 00:26:20.080]   a phone call to say we found it that doesn't strike me as right that's a privacy issue right
[00:26:20.080 --> 00:26:25.040]   there isn't it Renee you have to opt in I believe you have to opt in to be a finder like
[00:26:25.040 --> 00:26:27.520]   because they're also worried about you like some people are going to be concerned simply
[00:26:27.520 --> 00:26:32.320]   by using resources like is my phone like wasting battery with these signals like was looking
[00:26:32.320 --> 00:26:36.200]   for these fine things all the time so I believe there's going to be an opt in for the fine
[00:26:36.200 --> 00:26:40.960]   my network and you become like a finder who's who's similarly doing that to say oh I lost
[00:26:40.960 --> 00:26:46.120]   it I don't mind if a finder finds it and calls me I think that's an option to I think by default
[00:26:46.120 --> 00:26:49.760]   it goes to Apple and Apple alerts you through that would be better find my portal that would
[00:26:49.760 --> 00:26:53.560]   be like the same with your say the thing is like it works so like right now you could
[00:26:53.560 --> 00:26:56.560]   go buy an iPhone SE and throw it in the back of somebody's car and track that thing for
[00:26:56.560 --> 00:27:00.440]   like two days or an Android phone attract that thing they're like but with this and it's
[00:27:00.440 --> 00:27:04.640]   the same options if your iPhone is lost you can just passively go track it but you can
[00:27:04.640 --> 00:27:08.480]   also say put a message on because I left it in a cab and there's no way I'm going to find
[00:27:08.480 --> 00:27:12.240]   it and I want the like it's valuable enough for me that I want to be happy to call me
[00:27:12.240 --> 00:27:16.240]   yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah and privacy is about options it's not about zero knowledge like
[00:27:16.240 --> 00:27:19.480]   in certain situations about zero knowledge but a lot of situations it's just about consent
[00:27:19.480 --> 00:27:24.120]   as long as you can send to do what you want yes yes you'll also receive a notification
[00:27:24.120 --> 00:27:28.840]   as soon as your iPhone this is again this is from an article five days ago from Mac
[00:27:28.840 --> 00:27:33.880]   rumors everything we know or think we know about the about your tags you'll receive and
[00:27:33.880 --> 00:27:37.800]   so consider this all speculation you receive a notification as soon as an iPhone comes across
[00:27:37.800 --> 00:27:42.920]   your lost item so that's what you were talking about leveraging Bluetooth will I be able to
[00:27:42.920 --> 00:27:48.600]   this is an interesting feature you can set boundaries for air tags you can say here's
[00:27:48.600 --> 00:27:55.880]   a safe location you can do that with tile can you yeah you can say well in the boundaries
[00:27:55.880 --> 00:28:00.520]   you can say you my backpack can't go more than 20 feet from me before my before I go yeah
[00:28:00.520 --> 00:28:04.920]   track you'll do that too but this is a little different it says if an item with an apple
[00:28:04.920 --> 00:28:09.200]   tag is in a safe location such as your home you're not going to receive a notification
[00:28:09.200 --> 00:28:13.640]   when it's left behind in other words you right it will not bother you that you've left your
[00:28:13.640 --> 00:28:18.840]   apple TV remote behind that's where it belongs or if you've or if you've checked your bag
[00:28:18.840 --> 00:28:24.440]   at a theater or something like that yeah if it leaves the safe note location if somebody steals
[00:28:24.440 --> 00:28:29.560]   your apple TV remote control you'll get a notification and you can check going to because it's going
[00:28:29.560 --> 00:28:33.960]   to have a chip in it and they're gonna want it they're gonna want it just parenthetically by the way
[00:28:33.960 --> 00:28:38.200]   yesterday I spent an hour and a half with my mom trying to explain to her how to use the apple
[00:28:38.200 --> 00:28:45.880]   TV remote. Unfree job crack the interface with a touchpad but they did not crack the remote
[00:28:45.880 --> 00:28:51.880]   the implementation was not cracked well the thing is is that I'm on this show I've been using an apple
[00:28:51.880 --> 00:28:57.480]   product since 1983 and I get confused because the apps are doing different something's changed
[00:28:57.480 --> 00:29:00.280]   where they used to be you could just tap the thing on the top and it would just do everything you
[00:29:00.280 --> 00:29:05.160]   can do and now there's like and my son knows everything he's like dad use the menu yeah but if you're
[00:29:05.160 --> 00:29:10.920]   88 years old imagine I'm 50 and I don't understand it like I'm 50 I'm like I don't understand why I
[00:29:10.920 --> 00:29:15.080]   have all these things and you know it's like I just want to do the thing with the top part I
[00:29:15.080 --> 00:29:19.240]   don't want to do with any of the buttons I was able to I think within that 90 minutes to kind of
[00:29:19.240 --> 00:29:23.800]   not teach her but set up the apple TV so that for instance when you press the home I said press
[00:29:23.800 --> 00:29:27.320]   the home button she was a witch button's that is that the one with the TV on it yes yeah that's the
[00:29:27.320 --> 00:29:32.440]   home button press the home of course that's what it is press the home button right and you know the
[00:29:32.440 --> 00:29:37.080]   really confusing thing is sometimes it pulls up the apple TV app sometimes it pulls up home if you
[00:29:37.080 --> 00:29:41.080]   press it twice it pulls up home but you can turn that off I got that turned off so it's always the
[00:29:41.080 --> 00:29:47.160]   home string because she she wanted to watch billions on showtime so I got our showtime subscription I
[00:29:47.160 --> 00:29:53.480]   showed her oh this was painful how to make the icon jiggle jiggle jiggle and move up to the top of
[00:29:53.480 --> 00:29:57.880]   the page so that she doesn't have to go through three pages of icons I started to show her how to
[00:29:57.880 --> 00:30:02.360]   delete icons on the apple TV interface and I thought oh this is no this is too painful
[00:30:02.360 --> 00:30:06.760]   just we'll move them around and so that you don't see this stuff below the fold stuff like that
[00:30:06.760 --> 00:30:13.800]   uh it took me a long long time she got it uh she could never go back and do it again you know I
[00:30:13.800 --> 00:30:19.880]   had to walk her through it what's the clicker so there's a you know how mom you have a trackpad
[00:30:19.880 --> 00:30:24.920]   in your laptop well there's a little tiny one at the top of the apple TV remote what I wish we could
[00:30:24.920 --> 00:30:29.080]   do remote setup for these things they'd be so nice and they just made a feature of remote setup
[00:30:29.080 --> 00:30:34.120]   that would let us do all of these just nuts how accurate are air tags macromor says air tags are
[00:30:34.120 --> 00:30:40.360]   rumored to be more accurate than your average your average bluetooth item tracker like tile
[00:30:40.360 --> 00:30:46.520]   because they take advantage of ultra wideband technology uh so the iPhones have the u1 ship
[00:30:46.520 --> 00:30:50.120]   we then that's the thing we don't there are some things that don't have a u1 ship the
[00:30:50.120 --> 00:30:56.440]   tracker does the air tags do but uh and the phone does if you have a late model and you can imagine
[00:30:56.440 --> 00:31:01.800]   that I don't know you can imagine that the trackers are great for us to kind of throw into things
[00:31:01.800 --> 00:31:06.120]   and onto things but imagine them being embedded into lots and lots of devices yeah so that you
[00:31:06.120 --> 00:31:11.800]   just know where everything is yeah you know you someone takes all the what what happens when this
[00:31:11.800 --> 00:31:17.400]   so when you think about the phones all being able to interact with each other and see these and be
[00:31:17.400 --> 00:31:21.880]   able to report back to you anonymously or whatever someone steals your car it takes all the fun out
[00:31:21.880 --> 00:31:25.560]   of it if you've got a tracker in it because it just you see where the car went you know and so
[00:31:25.560 --> 00:31:32.920]   you know so the the thing is is that theft becomes it this expanded makes theft a lot less
[00:31:32.920 --> 00:31:37.160]   interesting if you're an apple if you're an iPhone user or an apple user is because you could
[00:31:37.160 --> 00:31:41.480]   theoretically have you know these things could eventually be embedded into your into your camera
[00:31:41.480 --> 00:31:48.360]   into your you know everything that you you you know have that could be taken yeah like to be
[00:31:48.360 --> 00:31:53.960]   terrified but that's why there's a whole there's a whole industry of of back of the truck things
[00:31:53.960 --> 00:31:56.920]   they fell out of the back of the truck should be terrified because this this really takes all
[00:31:56.920 --> 00:32:01.800]   the fun out of it yeah no it does take all the fun out of it the question is how interested are
[00:32:01.800 --> 00:32:06.200]   the police local police departments going to be on chasing after every single one of these reports
[00:32:06.200 --> 00:32:10.760]   that's generated by by a tag in this in this kind of a future I mean it's there there are a lot
[00:32:10.760 --> 00:32:15.640]   of implications that are academic by nature but they're still kind of interesting like
[00:32:15.640 --> 00:32:21.080]   just because your car has a tag in it that says that can track it when it's being stolen
[00:32:21.080 --> 00:32:26.120]   how quickly can you get the local police department to say hey I have information here's exactly where
[00:32:26.120 --> 00:32:30.200]   it is are they going to jump on that either way or are they going to get or they're going to get
[00:32:30.200 --> 00:32:35.880]   to it before the for the chop chop gets to it and another thing to think about is when how long do
[00:32:35.880 --> 00:32:43.080]   we have to wait until apple gets sued because there was some sort of a high profile enough
[00:32:43.080 --> 00:32:48.680]   theft let's say it was a laptop that had something super super valuable secret on it and someone is
[00:32:48.680 --> 00:32:54.040]   really really interested in making sure that whoever was who stole this gets absolutely
[00:32:54.040 --> 00:32:59.880]   hammered by the law how long is it going to take for that person to at least explore suing apple
[00:32:59.880 --> 00:33:04.600]   to say well look clearly if the what are the chances that there was some person the person
[00:33:04.600 --> 00:33:09.080]   who stole it had an iPhone and that the apple tag that was let's say let's say it was a backpack
[00:33:09.080 --> 00:33:15.400]   let's say it was something valuable in it that the person who stole it the air tag that I put
[00:33:15.400 --> 00:33:20.840]   inside this backpack or inside this parcel or this piece of art is was close enough so that I know
[00:33:20.840 --> 00:33:26.600]   who stole it because gee maybe it was maybe it was the person whose iPhone was was four feet away
[00:33:26.600 --> 00:33:32.520]   from this for about 18 hours starting from the hour that it went missing if that information is
[00:33:32.520 --> 00:33:37.320]   somehow retrievable by apple someone is going to find themselves with an interest in suing
[00:33:37.320 --> 00:33:41.880]   them to get at it if even if it's not the law enforcement this is why i'm sure that apple has
[00:33:41.880 --> 00:33:48.840]   an explanation of why they don't have any way whatsoever of rewinding and figuring out what
[00:33:48.840 --> 00:33:53.320]   phones this device was actually close to because that would be another huge security breach
[00:33:53.320 --> 00:33:59.400]   there is effect and this is to be a class action so fast there is effect to keep somebody from say
[00:33:59.400 --> 00:34:06.280]   slipping an air tag into your purse or and track you there is in fact a warning when there is an
[00:34:06.280 --> 00:34:14.920]   air tag near you a notification but only if you have an iPhone it's already people saying apple
[00:34:14.920 --> 00:34:19.160]   slutty yeah but i'm not sure if this is something that's only enabled when it's under certain modes
[00:34:19.160 --> 00:34:23.240]   like because if you're not tracking somebody these things aren't going to be active all the time
[00:34:23.240 --> 00:34:26.920]   they're only going to be active when you actually go and look for them so i'm hoping that there's
[00:34:26.920 --> 00:34:31.400]   some sort of compromise here where they're dormant for the vast majority of time and they wouldn't be
[00:34:31.400 --> 00:34:35.560]   a security issue to anybody at all but the minute you put them into tracking mode if you're around
[00:34:35.560 --> 00:34:39.160]   them because other people are worried like what if somebody has an air tag next to them in their
[00:34:39.160 --> 00:34:42.520]   wallet and i'm sitting with next them on the bus is my iPhone going to put up a warning all of a
[00:34:42.520 --> 00:34:47.880]   sudden because there's a an unknown tracker near me that there's so many little edge cases that apple
[00:34:47.880 --> 00:34:52.040]   is going to have to have figured out maybe not to announce all at once at the event but to have
[00:34:52.040 --> 00:34:56.920]   documented and at least speak to us on background about to assuage i think a lot of the
[00:34:56.920 --> 00:35:01.880]   again the rigmarole it's going to pop up from all this what i mean there's what what do i have a
[00:35:01.880 --> 00:35:09.240]   uwb chip in what what devices your iPhone your iPhone 11 your iPhone 12 your home pod mini oh
[00:35:09.240 --> 00:35:13.240]   really not your big home pod at the mini that's what let's it do no that's what let's do that
[00:35:13.240 --> 00:35:16.680]   cool hand off thing where you bring your iPhone close to it and it shakes because it knows
[00:35:16.680 --> 00:35:21.800]   approximately yeah and i believe that's it so far although we're all hoping the apple tv gets it in
[00:35:21.800 --> 00:35:26.360]   the update because everybody wants facial audio now they've had a taste for it we all want everything
[00:35:26.360 --> 00:35:30.280]   to act like a speaker not a headphone anymore so everyone wants that on the apple tv one more
[00:35:30.280 --> 00:35:37.960]   thing the apple watch series six has a u1 chip in it yes so basically i'm carrying an air tag on
[00:35:37.960 --> 00:35:43.000]   my wrist at all times which is very interesting yes fair one that's why lisa doesn't worry about
[00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:47.800]   losing you leo yes she's never gonna lose me and and one of the one of these go back to
[00:35:47.800 --> 00:35:51.720]   actually and he was more prolly she's never gonna lose my apple watch you might lose the person
[00:35:51.720 --> 00:35:57.000]   who's supposed to be apple watch is fine i don't know what the apple watch is sorry Alex go ahead
[00:35:57.000 --> 00:36:01.160]   no i was gonna say to the you know the the things that we don't know that the and he started to go
[00:36:01.160 --> 00:36:04.920]   down the path of is is you know i i grew up in the country if someone took our stuff we wouldn't
[00:36:04.920 --> 00:36:10.280]   call the police you know like yeah you just gotta shock that i know yeah so so the so the thing is is
[00:36:10.280 --> 00:36:15.720]   that the the ability to you know i've had situations where someone stole one of our laptops you know at
[00:36:15.720 --> 00:36:22.120]   a show right and we have software in the in the laptop that we just know where it is we can look
[00:36:22.120 --> 00:36:27.640]   at it yeah can look at the screen it's low gen yeah i knew who that person was i knew where they
[00:36:27.640 --> 00:36:31.480]   lived i knew the fact that they were divorced i knew that their kid lives in two different spots i
[00:36:31.480 --> 00:36:36.520]   knew that the three businesses that they that they've had i knew everything about that person
[00:36:36.520 --> 00:36:40.680]   because they stole my laptop and i just let them have it for a year you know oh my god
[00:36:40.680 --> 00:36:45.720]   and because because because the thing is is that is that interacting with them that's probably
[00:36:45.720 --> 00:36:51.240]   illegal by the way ladies and gentlemen please no no i know local laws before you who asked people
[00:36:51.240 --> 00:36:54.520]   i didn't harass anybody i didn't i didn't do anything i never interacted with them oh
[00:36:54.520 --> 00:37:01.240]   you know so so i didn't so uh what you do how did you torture them i didn't torture them at all i
[00:37:01.240 --> 00:37:04.680]   they still have my laptop oh i didn't do anything oh you just know what i'm saying is but you didn't
[00:37:04.680 --> 00:37:08.920]   use it against them but you could have i didn't use any of it you know because of the thing is is
[00:37:08.920 --> 00:37:13.400]   that it's just that i i could you know you with them with the maraki stuff that we have i could
[00:37:13.400 --> 00:37:16.440]   just see on the map where they were yeah you know and then you just do a search and then
[00:37:16.440 --> 00:37:20.920]   just they actually the problem with being apple is that they probably uh smart that uh
[00:37:20.920 --> 00:37:24.360]   thief would figure out how to turn it off the maraki stuff they didn't even think about
[00:37:24.360 --> 00:37:29.880]   so right right now the maraki stuff is in base layer right so so the you could you could anyway so
[00:37:31.160 --> 00:37:35.800]   so anyway so the issue was is that i chose not to have an interaction because i knew that the
[00:37:35.800 --> 00:37:40.440]   police aren't going to do anything about it and a macbook air they're not going to
[00:37:40.440 --> 00:37:45.320]   to Andy's point they're not going to do it now i'm not and it wasn't worth creating a an
[00:37:45.320 --> 00:37:48.920]   interaction you know i just made the you know the choice we're just going to write that you know
[00:37:48.920 --> 00:37:55.560]   write that laptop off yeah you know and and um and so uh so that's the but but there will be
[00:37:55.560 --> 00:38:00.360]   people who won't do that right you know there'll be people who well that's said about losing their
[00:38:00.360 --> 00:38:05.080]   there are something yeah start the timer because there will be people that that did it with fine
[00:38:05.080 --> 00:38:10.680]   my iPhone who will track it down you know they'll go right into the den of thieves and that is not
[00:38:10.680 --> 00:38:14.360]   a safe they'll be already there want to have a confrontation yeah that's not a good thing to do
[00:38:14.360 --> 00:38:18.680]   don't do that we've all we've already seen how bad that can be remember the the the data the
[00:38:18.680 --> 00:38:23.720]   data the location data that uh that a lot of different these finding services we're subscribing to
[00:38:23.720 --> 00:38:28.040]   their default was if we don't know where if we can't figure out where this thing is we will simply we
[00:38:28.040 --> 00:38:32.360]   have to have we have to respond something or else the the software crashes so we're just going to
[00:38:32.360 --> 00:38:37.080]   pick the geographical center of the United States of America right and as a result this poor people
[00:38:37.080 --> 00:38:41.560]   in Kansas this house kept getting what people with guns like hey you got my phone you have my phone
[00:38:41.560 --> 00:38:46.360]   you have my phone and worse so they're they're just they're just so many really interesting aspects
[00:38:46.360 --> 00:38:52.040]   of this but the the the but the last thing and this is this is i'm completely open to speculation
[00:38:52.040 --> 00:38:59.320]   that this is a natural place to use a cr 20 32 battery this tiny little like dime size ubiquitous
[00:38:59.320 --> 00:39:04.200]   battery that can run these low energy things for like a whole year but the question is is apple
[00:39:04.200 --> 00:39:11.320]   going to be so focused on gee we don't want to be creating something that uses a disposable battery
[00:39:11.320 --> 00:39:16.440]   that they're going to do something that's rechargeable because i don't see i don't see how they could do
[00:39:16.440 --> 00:39:22.200]   it but i also see apple at least investigating how they can avoid using disposable disposable
[00:39:22.200 --> 00:39:26.920]   batteries in an apple product yeah that couple by the way who lived in that Kansas
[00:39:26.920 --> 00:39:35.080]   farmhouse yeah 600 million ip addresses pointed to their because it's the geographic center
[00:39:35.080 --> 00:39:41.800]   of the United States yeah people would leave old toilets in their driveway they would do all
[00:39:41.800 --> 00:39:47.080]   sorts of things cops came to their house because everything and this was all because of one ip
[00:39:47.080 --> 00:39:53.960]   location company max mine they ended up suing them because if max mine couldn't figure out what an
[00:39:53.960 --> 00:40:02.280]   ip address was they'd put it in this Kansas farmhouse so that's not a privacy first decision is it
[00:40:02.280 --> 00:40:07.080]   yeah no that's not a hey nothing bad can come with this and we just report that we don't we don't
[00:40:07.080 --> 00:40:10.520]   know where it is but we're going to definitively give you an address anyway here's the here's the
[00:40:10.520 --> 00:40:13.400]   broken toilet left in their driveway for no reason
[00:40:13.400 --> 00:40:19.000]   just maybe the maybe the toilet had like a tile tracker on it
[00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:22.200]   and the person found it by the side of the road i thought they were doing something nice by returning
[00:40:22.200 --> 00:40:29.720]   it anyway we you might wonder how how can we keep saying airtext why why do maybe apple will
[00:40:29.720 --> 00:40:36.360]   call it something else well apple kind of leaked this back in april of uh 2020 they uploaded a
[00:40:36.360 --> 00:40:43.560]   tech support video uh for fine my iPhone accidentally left this text in offline finding enables this
[00:40:43.560 --> 00:40:50.440]   device and air tags to be found we're not connected to Wi-Fi or cellular um never you know so now they
[00:40:50.440 --> 00:40:55.720]   could change that but i think they're they've kind of committed to air tags for more than a year
[00:40:55.720 --> 00:41:01.480]   um there's air text this doesn't have the same ring no air tags is pretty good there's patents
[00:41:02.200 --> 00:41:08.920]   there's uh pictures of uh accessories accessories i mean i can't wait till Andy gets his gucci
[00:41:08.920 --> 00:41:13.480]   air tags keychain and just lords it over me like he does so many things i love it then no man i
[00:41:13.480 --> 00:41:17.800]   don't know you'll you'll have your own ermet you'll have your ermet is one before i do yeah exactly
[00:41:17.800 --> 00:41:22.520]   oh god it's gonna oh they found another way to extract all my money from me oh i don't even think
[00:41:22.520 --> 00:41:28.360]   of that it's your new air tag case you gotta have one uh do we know what the price will be no but
[00:41:28.360 --> 00:41:32.600]   do you want to speculate it'll be expensive it's gonna be expensive i mean of course it's apple
[00:41:32.600 --> 00:41:35.640]   because you're gonna have to buy the air tag then you're gonna have to buy the wallet thing or the
[00:41:35.640 --> 00:41:40.280]   keychain thing or the like it'll work really well and it'll be really expensive so i don't need to
[00:41:40.280 --> 00:41:45.480]   put one on my phone on my watch uh i would love it if you're right the new apple tv certainly if
[00:41:45.480 --> 00:41:49.880]   they are going to announce an apple tv which apparently is a part of the rumor um they would
[00:41:49.880 --> 00:41:55.480]   release a a remote that has you you you that's a cheap chip right that you want it it's small enough
[00:41:55.480 --> 00:42:02.040]   to put in a watch yeah it's apple's version of a commodity chip yeah uh so you'd buy it for your
[00:42:02.040 --> 00:42:07.400]   keys your backpack i mean i think i think you get mustang your laptop kids i mean i think that
[00:42:07.400 --> 00:42:10.680]   everything apple makes should have one in it because again if someone takes your laptop they have
[00:42:10.680 --> 00:42:14.600]   so you could put it in the laptop in a way that you'd have to basically disassemble and ruin the
[00:42:14.600 --> 00:42:18.760]   it's hard the value of the computers oh but what Alex want them in every one of his audio and
[00:42:18.760 --> 00:42:22.280]   video components so that they would all know the position of each of them and can perfectly
[00:42:22.280 --> 00:42:27.000]   balance themselves to every scenario you put them in well well the the main thing is is that we we
[00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:31.080]   talk to a lot of tracking companies about that because when we work at facilities we're worried
[00:42:31.080 --> 00:42:36.760]   that our gear is going to walk off and so having that have you know having per like we looked at
[00:42:36.760 --> 00:42:41.880]   putting trackers inside of our atm switchers and because there's a lot of space in there and a
[00:42:41.880 --> 00:42:47.240]   lot of those and you could put one in on the inside of it and it just was that they the battery life
[00:42:47.240 --> 00:42:51.880]   wasn't long enough the the um you know there was a bunch of issues with those things but
[00:42:51.880 --> 00:42:56.040]   you know as this progresses there's a lot of really interesting things when those trackers
[00:42:56.040 --> 00:43:00.600]   are really accurate because they might know uh what the whole bunch of things your luggage gets
[00:43:00.600 --> 00:43:06.760]   lost and they know where your luggage is so they the um you uh you'll know whether all the gear that
[00:43:06.760 --> 00:43:12.760]   you came with that kit kit like literally in the case what you put in it is all there you know um
[00:43:12.760 --> 00:43:17.960]   and taking it out and so there's a lot of places where um if we really get accurate tracking
[00:43:17.960 --> 00:43:22.920]   there's a lot of things that we can because if you mix it makes something else like the
[00:43:22.920 --> 00:43:27.240]   the a lot of people are super interested because right now the home pod minis have
[00:43:27.240 --> 00:43:32.120]   u1 chips in and if there's an update of the home pod biggies with u1 chips and the apple tv has a
[00:43:32.120 --> 00:43:35.720]   u1 chip and they have all of this acoustic measurement technology already in them the
[00:43:35.720 --> 00:43:40.920]   computational um spatial awareness you just drop those things in your house and you get perfect
[00:43:40.920 --> 00:43:45.720]   Dolby Atmos without having to know a damn thing about Dolby Atmos and if you start adding that to
[00:43:45.720 --> 00:43:49.720]   all the other like your phone and all the positions that those where you are in the room as well
[00:43:49.720 --> 00:43:53.160]   just the idea for self-configuration to me is incredibly exciting
[00:43:53.160 --> 00:43:59.880]   yeah there's um my my house i've been thinking about that a lot because my house has a lot of
[00:43:59.880 --> 00:44:03.080]   speakers in it a lot of different rooms have different different speakers and i've been
[00:44:03.080 --> 00:44:06.760]   am shocked i've been thinking i'm waiting for halloween because there's like i have like uh
[00:44:06.760 --> 00:44:14.520]   there's probably um almost 30 speakers total wow because there's 10 10 stereo spaces 1 5 1 1 7 1
[00:44:14.520 --> 00:44:21.720]   1 7 2 you have 10 surround sound stereo setups no no no just 10 stereo just 10 stereo not
[00:44:21.720 --> 00:44:25.400]   surround sound there's two surround there's one that's in my office and then one and then one
[00:44:25.400 --> 00:44:31.640]   why do you have 10 stereo scenarios it not the nosterias are in the walls oh i see they're
[00:44:31.640 --> 00:44:36.680]   for their free trim and like yeah and so like i do with the sonos yeah there's there's a whole
[00:44:36.680 --> 00:44:42.920]   bunch of i have uh 10 sonoses um and so they so they um but i'm looking at replacing those with
[00:44:42.920 --> 00:44:50.360]   dante and um and uh you know bunch of uh anyway so a bunch of bunch of stuff but one of the things
[00:44:50.360 --> 00:44:53.480]   that i've been thinking about is the fact that i could with all these speakers in the house i
[00:44:53.480 --> 00:44:57.800]   could make the for halloween i could make the ultimate haunted house so yeah just coming from
[00:44:57.800 --> 00:45:02.600]   all the difference and so by by getting out of the sonos and putting them into a central
[00:45:02.600 --> 00:45:07.800]   audio management um i can you know do a lot more and i think you know apple could obviously to
[00:45:07.800 --> 00:45:11.640]   rainy age point do a lot of really interesting things that's actually why i was disappointed
[00:45:11.640 --> 00:45:17.240]   up with it because i thought the air part uh air uh the home bod minis would follow me around but
[00:45:17.240 --> 00:45:21.960]   you have to do it man you have to say yes move it over here step by step Leo it would be so nice
[00:45:21.960 --> 00:45:27.400]   if they just as i walked around the house the room came alive i bet Alex is figuring out what to do
[00:45:27.400 --> 00:45:31.160]   you would get a button to enable this and then Lisa would get a button to disable it right
[00:45:31.160 --> 00:45:35.000]   down to the noise no she would love it because she listens to a book and as she walks around the
[00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:41.320]   house the book would follow but who wins but who wins when you're both home well i let me just put
[00:45:41.320 --> 00:45:46.200]   it this way there's a lot before i even try to get uh my amazon echo to read me a book i'll say
[00:45:46.200 --> 00:45:51.160]   echo switch accounts because i know it's gonna be at least as a can i know it is let's take a break
[00:45:51.160 --> 00:45:56.280]   lots more in the rumor mill see we don't need news we just need rumors
[00:45:56.840 --> 00:46:02.360]   better than news lots more yeah because we're not we're not constrained by the facts yes we can
[00:46:02.360 --> 00:46:06.600]   possibly be wrong i gotta do an unboxing because i just got this in the mail from Ford i don't know
[00:46:06.600 --> 00:46:12.120]   what it is for because i you know i bought a mustang maki first edition and i got a box in the mail so
[00:46:12.120 --> 00:46:20.200]   what is this we'll find out the suspense is killing me the tease i don't i don't want to make you feel
[00:46:20.200 --> 00:46:25.240]   bad but you ever heard that scam like on alie bobbo alie express where like you buy they get a good
[00:46:25.240 --> 00:46:28.760]   deal on like chairs and then they send it to you and it's actually like dollhouse chairs if this
[00:46:28.760 --> 00:46:36.040]   is maybe just bought like a model if this is the maki we pissed but it's made of gold yeah it's made
[00:46:36.040 --> 00:46:42.120]   of gold it's really smooth and it's got it it's got a nft connected to it actually i already got the
[00:46:42.120 --> 00:46:47.800]   car so i'm i'm good on that this is something okay this is just a bonus this is apparently a reward
[00:46:47.800 --> 00:46:51.320]   for buying the first edition i guess they didn't mention this when i bought it but uh
[00:46:51.960 --> 00:46:57.640]   given how expensive it was i'm probably to serve something maybe some gold driving gloves i don't
[00:46:57.640 --> 00:47:05.000]   know our show our show today brought to you by zip recruiter if i if you are hiring and i guess
[00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:12.040]   you know i just saw the job report jobs report uh for a february and i think what it was at 349,000
[00:47:12.040 --> 00:47:17.240]   new jobs are slowly coming back right if you're one of those wonderful companies we love you that
[00:47:17.240 --> 00:47:22.680]   is hiring that is that is bringing people back in as we slowly come back after the pandemic you need
[00:47:22.680 --> 00:47:28.600]   to know about zip recruiter it's the best way to hire it's the way you know when we were hiring the
[00:47:28.600 --> 00:47:32.600]   way we used to hire in fact the number of our employees aim through zip recruiter here's why we
[00:47:32.600 --> 00:47:38.840]   use it let me explain why it's so great you know it's finding you know i guess the preface is
[00:47:38.840 --> 00:47:44.360]   the people you hire are are vital to your companies the most probably the most important single thing
[00:47:44.360 --> 00:47:49.480]   you do in a company is is hire because those people are what the companies made of they're the
[00:47:49.480 --> 00:47:55.640]   they're the raw materials great employees transform a company an employee who's not so great can bring
[00:47:55.640 --> 00:48:01.160]   it right down steve jobs always said that hire a employees hire the you know hire the best zip
[00:48:01.160 --> 00:48:05.560]   recruiter helps you do that because first of all you're casting the widest net i mean finding a
[00:48:05.560 --> 00:48:11.800]   great employee might feel like i'm i'm looking for a needle in a haystack but well when you post to
[00:48:11.800 --> 00:48:17.560]   zip recruiter it goes to more than a hundred job sites and social networks with one click so
[00:48:17.560 --> 00:48:23.800]   immediately you are spreading that search as widely as possible but the other thing that's great
[00:48:23.800 --> 00:48:27.480]   about it that you might say well that's not good i'm going to get hundreds of applications my
[00:48:27.480 --> 00:48:31.800]   my email is going to be jammed my phone's never going to stop ringing no no it all goes into the
[00:48:31.800 --> 00:48:36.760]   zip recruiter interface and the zip recruiter interface is great because it reformats all the
[00:48:36.760 --> 00:48:42.440]   resumes so they're easy for you to scan you can have screening questions true false multiple choice
[00:48:42.440 --> 00:48:46.760]   so you can really narrow it down to people who are right for the job eliminate people who just
[00:48:46.760 --> 00:48:51.320]   aren't right for the job the best things that recruiter does completely unique they have a
[00:48:51.320 --> 00:48:56.360]   matching technology that finds people with the right skills and experience for the job you just
[00:48:56.360 --> 00:49:03.560]   posted and actively invites them to apply so while other services might overwhelm you
[00:49:04.280 --> 00:49:08.840]   with you know at job applications to sift through zip recruiter finds what you're looking for that
[00:49:08.840 --> 00:49:13.880]   needle in the haystack and brings it to you in fact zip recruiters so effective four out of five

[00:50:46.360 --> 00:50:54.280]   free apple like bocks what's here's a card oh look hmm oh pretty what's in here is it a note is it a
[00:50:54.280 --> 00:50:59.560]   thank you note congratulations welcome to the Mustang family wait a minute what's this
[00:50:59.560 --> 00:51:06.200]   fractal pony assembly oop there's my vin i guess i don't have to hide the vin because uh
[00:51:06.200 --> 00:51:10.680]   it should should i but it's in the windshield anybody who finds the car can can see i don't know
[00:51:10.680 --> 00:51:16.120]   what to do with this oh this i just hide everything by default it's a plaque oh maybe it goes with
[00:51:16.120 --> 00:51:21.400]   whatever's in here let's see you think i should hide that oh you should maybe you shouldn't share
[00:51:21.400 --> 00:51:26.120]   it with like the entire world people who you have to you have to show to people who are actually
[00:51:26.120 --> 00:51:31.320]   in proximity with the car yeah that's true you don't have a choice look at that it's a fractal
[00:51:31.320 --> 00:51:39.000]   3d it's it's low poly Mustang it's like ps2 Mustang PLA Mustang it's a knowledge of
[00:51:39.000 --> 00:51:45.240]   james oh i see that's what this is for so this has the vin on it and then you put it on this stand
[00:51:45.240 --> 00:51:52.200]   okay that's that's and then you skin it you can get texture maps for it yes that's nice hide the
[00:51:52.200 --> 00:51:57.480]   hide the vin that's kind of cool your l texture map actually i posted the vin on a maki forum
[00:51:57.480 --> 00:52:03.000]   so i don't that's cool okay yeah i mean i know what are they gonna do with it though right
[00:52:03.000 --> 00:52:06.520]   maybe that's also the control code leo no everyone's gonna be driving your car
[00:52:06.520 --> 00:52:13.640]   it's it's there is a password there are too many people who quote the art of war without actually
[00:52:13.640 --> 00:52:18.040]   like reading it yeah one of the things that always makes sense is the basic principle is deny your
[00:52:18.040 --> 00:52:22.840]   enemy information that's good good good good point all right that's a good security
[00:52:22.840 --> 00:52:26.600]   which maki did you get leo the first edition that's why it says first edition
[00:52:26.600 --> 00:52:31.000]   not only got that because i wanted to get it before the minute was available
[00:52:31.000 --> 00:52:39.080]   it's very nice it's very nice i'm i'm a fan do you have chargers do you have a plethora of chargers
[00:52:39.080 --> 00:52:46.120]   available to you uh yes because it uses ccs fast charging which is electrify america nice and as
[00:52:46.120 --> 00:52:50.280]   part of the deal after vox wagon got caught with diesel gate
[00:52:50.280 --> 00:52:57.720]   a part part of the many things they had to do to make up for it uh they um built they're spending
[00:52:57.720 --> 00:53:03.800]   a billion dollars to put chargers all over um the country fast chargers and there's one across
[00:53:03.800 --> 00:53:08.920]   the street from my house not that i need it nice but the outlet mall has three different companies
[00:53:08.920 --> 00:53:14.920]   are doing chargers because you know we i live in petaluma the the town that banned gas stations
[00:53:14.920 --> 00:53:22.280]   so they better tamper put those chargers you can't run a car on eggs yeah yeah all right sorry that's
[00:53:22.280 --> 00:53:26.520]   that's not very mackish of me but i just i the box came and i had to open it and i apologize we were
[00:53:26.520 --> 00:53:33.960]   vamping for alix yeah what were you doing alix i i just needed some tea oh because i mentioned i
[00:53:33.960 --> 00:53:40.120]   wasn't making brad again i mentioned uh yes exactly the pizza dough how did that pizza come out for unsun
[00:53:40.120 --> 00:53:45.320]   sunday or came out really well oh man yeah it was good it was a good bring for all of us alix i
[00:53:45.320 --> 00:53:50.920]   ate it sorry we ate it family ate it i love that uni oven that's a really great oven and
[00:53:50.920 --> 00:53:56.840]   yeah thank you larry gill for suggesting it yeah that's really good all right there you go see
[00:53:56.840 --> 00:54:02.120]   look at that it's uh it's wonderful oh it's pretty i'll put it right here it's a 3d it's kind i feel
[00:54:02.120 --> 00:54:05.560]   like this kind of thing alex lindsey would do now you can come and take a picture of it and print
[00:54:06.440 --> 00:54:13.640]   yes hundreds of them uh so air tags i think we i think we covered air tags in as much depth as
[00:54:13.640 --> 00:54:24.520]   anybody would care i know what do we know about the um air pods the new air pods third generation
[00:54:24.520 --> 00:54:28.760]   air pods will have the same design apparently as air pods probe but they will not have the noise
[00:54:28.760 --> 00:54:33.960]   cancellation and transparency modes so if you were one of the people that johnnie i've modeled that
[00:54:33.960 --> 00:54:38.920]   pure silicon that pure plastic tip on then you will have to give that up and go in ear like the
[00:54:38.920 --> 00:54:44.280]   rest of us prefer that softer the softer nicer ear the silicone ear some people hate the stuff
[00:54:44.280 --> 00:54:47.720]   going into their ear though and i worry that they're now out of luck there's always somebody's gonna
[00:54:47.720 --> 00:54:55.400]   be upset by any decision Leo um okay so that would they what would they call those just third
[00:54:55.400 --> 00:54:59.240]   generation air pods yeah yeah air pods three and then the air pods pro are supposed to be getting a
[00:54:59.240 --> 00:55:05.400]   no stem design at some point uh to keep oh that's right to keep our phone as high as possible yes
[00:55:05.400 --> 00:55:13.400]   it's just a way of selling more of those um ipad pro were due they did do they did a 12 only a
[00:55:13.400 --> 00:55:20.040]   12.9 inch ipad pro uh in 2020 and the only new thing really on that besides the a14 chip
[00:55:20.040 --> 00:55:27.640]   was the uh lidar there wasn't even a14 it was a 12z and had the eighth graphics core because the
[00:55:27.640 --> 00:55:31.400]   yield rates were up so it had the eighth graphics core fully functional it was a minor and they had
[00:55:31.400 --> 00:55:35.640]   some better memory bandwidth and it had the light yet had the lidar sensor on it and it had a wide
[00:55:35.640 --> 00:55:41.880]   angle camera so like the camera system was better it didn't um it didn't uh they didn't offer an
[00:55:41.880 --> 00:55:46.600]   11 inch either right just the 12.9 i think they did and i think they all went to six gigabytes of
[00:55:46.600 --> 00:55:50.760]   memory it was the other because previously only the highest storage tier the one terabyte was six
[00:55:50.760 --> 00:55:56.120]   gigabytes so it was a minor a minor upgrade what i presume that we'll see a newer chip
[00:55:56.120 --> 00:56:02.920]   yeah an a14 or something right a14x which would be very similar to an m1 and wow so i have questions
[00:56:02.920 --> 00:56:07.880]   my question well the m1 is basically an a14x chip that's same what we'd expect to have in those
[00:56:07.880 --> 00:56:12.920]   cores but with the additional max stuff like virtualization and um emulation but also what i'm
[00:56:12.920 --> 00:56:18.120]   hoping for is that they have on board two on board super fast thunderbolt controllers and
[00:56:18.120 --> 00:56:24.760]   now that the ipad error has usb c i would love the ipad pro to get thunderbolt so that
[00:56:24.760 --> 00:56:29.960]   you know i can attach my my ssd drive might sound like blazing fast ssd drive and get
[00:56:29.960 --> 00:56:35.080]   some real throughput on video going into the ipad that would be pretty cool i feel like they
[00:56:35.080 --> 00:56:38.360]   won't do it just so that i have something to be disappointed about but man it will also be the
[00:56:38.360 --> 00:56:44.680]   first apples supposedly moving to mini led screens this would be the first mini led screen is that
[00:56:44.680 --> 00:56:51.480]   right that's the rumor what does mini led what does mini led do for me i presume you know about
[00:56:51.480 --> 00:56:58.360]   this um i think i actually don't know as much about it i know a lot about o led but but uh mini led i
[00:56:58.360 --> 00:57:05.720]   think is from the lcd is going to um smaller back blocks more yeah because it's a full array
[00:57:05.720 --> 00:57:11.160]   local dimming and because they're smaller leds they're mini it'll be i believe that you're going to
[00:57:11.160 --> 00:57:16.200]   get rich with blacks um which which you notice on the current ipad is not as rich as the
[00:57:17.000 --> 00:57:23.160]   phones for instance yeah you get a higher contrast ratio better hdr in other words right yep okay
[00:57:23.160 --> 00:57:27.720]   okay without the drawbacks of o led on bigger panels which are still things like it has issues
[00:57:27.720 --> 00:57:32.680]   with great with contiguous brightness at ipad size and yield rates there's battery issues with
[00:57:32.680 --> 00:57:40.280]   o led there's uh burning issues with all issues yeah um and uh pulse with modulation on low
[00:57:40.280 --> 00:57:44.360]   brightness levels with some people hate and it's of course more expensive so i can see why they
[00:57:44.360 --> 00:57:51.240]   might want to find it an alternate technology um not quite as good as it would be like at this point
[00:57:51.240 --> 00:57:58.840]   yeah so so air so was there anything else that they would put in this to make it more pro than a
[00:57:58.840 --> 00:58:04.200]   faster chip and a better screen that's enough you could you could theoretically improve the the
[00:58:04.200 --> 00:58:11.000]   light arm i mean really um denser uh more power than the phone i mean that's i mean it's pretty clear
[00:58:11.000 --> 00:58:18.600]   the light are in both the iphone 12 and the ipad pro uh is really apple's way of testing something
[00:58:18.600 --> 00:58:23.560]   for future right for their ar Pro is terrible like they they didn't hook it into anything like when
[00:58:23.560 --> 00:58:27.560]   the iphone came out that light our system was hooked into everything and with the ipad they didn't
[00:58:27.560 --> 00:58:32.040]   hook it in like it if you press the button for portrait mode it switches you to the front facing
[00:58:32.040 --> 00:58:37.000]   camera which is the worst apple like it's just a completely unapple like experience because they
[00:58:37.000 --> 00:58:40.920]   didn't bother to hook it in to give you portrait mode on the back and my guess was that they didn't
[00:58:40.920 --> 00:58:45.480]   have time they were so busy working on the iphone 12 camera system they didn't have it ready and
[00:58:45.480 --> 00:58:50.120]   then as soon as that came out ios 14 would update and give us all that capabilities and ipad and it
[00:58:50.120 --> 00:58:54.760]   never did yeah so i don't know if there's alex's point of hardware deficiency there or a difference
[00:58:54.760 --> 00:59:00.200]   but just getting parity with with a lighter on the iphone would be huge at this point and i'd also
[00:59:00.200 --> 00:59:05.160]   be i don't think that it i'll go ahead quite handy uh uh actually this is a there's a new thing that
[00:59:05.160 --> 00:59:08.760]   a different thing so maybe you should finish yourself well all i was going to say is that the
[00:59:08.760 --> 00:59:13.640]   i don't think it's just testing it's it is uh it's not really testing the market as much as
[00:59:13.640 --> 00:59:19.800]   filling the market so as you as ar gets bigger what you don't want to do is have only the people who
[00:59:19.800 --> 00:59:27.160]   bought it on the last rev have access to the new tools so by having light are incorporated into
[00:59:27.160 --> 00:59:32.200]   everything over time it means that you know when you're talking to partners you can say well there's
[00:59:32.200 --> 00:59:36.920]   65 million people or 100 million people or 250 million people that already have this technology
[00:59:36.920 --> 00:59:41.240]   built in and we've seen that with other rollouts with apple where they say and your phone has already
[00:59:41.240 --> 00:59:48.040]   had this you know yeah so so the so the so that way they can over time they may not have the technology
[00:59:48.040 --> 00:59:53.000]   ready because there's this whole thing of you put something out and if it's not seen as successful
[00:59:53.000 --> 00:59:56.360]   then everyone stops working on it they're like okay that was a waste of time google has this problem
[00:59:56.360 --> 01:00:02.120]   all the time and so by by by flushing that whole market and building that out i mean i think what
[01:00:02.120 --> 01:00:09.240]   we're really seeing is an incredibly systematic uh like the in the same way that the m1 was just
[01:00:09.240 --> 01:00:15.320]   you know probably a decade of rollout the what we're seeing here is a really slow rollout of ar
[01:00:15.320 --> 01:00:19.640]   yeah where you're you're basically you know plowing all the fields and carefully seating all
[01:00:19.640 --> 01:00:24.600]   the fields and it's not some kind of like ola just throw it out and see if it works it's definitely a
[01:00:24.600 --> 01:00:28.600]   really heavy commitment and by the time it they really start doing and they're and they're you
[01:00:28.600 --> 01:00:32.200]   know giving the developers ar tools and they're giving them things to play with and they're giving
[01:00:32.200 --> 01:00:36.120]   them you know building it all out but i think that because i think that ar is probably going to be
[01:00:36.120 --> 01:00:44.600]   massive but it needs that kind of environment uh to to grow into because it is something very new
[01:00:44.600 --> 01:00:50.120]   and uh by the time they get to it a lot will be out there okay that's kind of what i was thinking
[01:00:50.120 --> 01:00:53.800]   i mean that's what's in a way that's what's really impressive about the apple machine
[01:00:53.800 --> 01:00:58.920]   is that they're able to you know because they don't tell people they don't do big beta
[01:00:58.920 --> 01:01:03.640]   releases they didn't do it at google did with the google glass probably wisely given the
[01:01:03.640 --> 01:01:09.480]   reception google glass ended up getting they they but they do believe sneak these things out as you
[01:01:09.480 --> 01:01:14.520]   said and uh slowly incrementally develop this stuff so that when the time comes they have a lot
[01:01:14.520 --> 01:01:18.520]   of experience using it and i guess that's probably what will happen with this lighter what could
[01:01:18.520 --> 01:01:25.800]   be improved um range range and resolution it feels pretty far now what how many feet 30 feet 30
[01:01:25.800 --> 01:01:30.360]   feet is pretty good yeah it is i've already had places where i wish what about 50 you'd like it to
[01:01:30.360 --> 01:01:34.280]   do the whole room in other words you'd like well so there's there's a bunch of things about it that
[01:01:34.280 --> 01:01:37.400]   are some of them are hardware and some of them are software having it be a little bit more powerful
[01:01:37.400 --> 01:01:41.960]   so it went out a little further would be really useful also having a little bit more density as
[01:01:41.960 --> 01:01:46.360]   it captures would be great um one of the things that in software that we haven't really seen
[01:01:46.840 --> 01:01:52.840]   that i think is going to end up coming number one is is a is the either the developers or apple
[01:01:52.840 --> 01:01:59.720]   getting better at understanding reasonable persistence of the 3d data so right now it's very
[01:01:59.720 --> 01:02:06.040]   basically that mesh just keeps changing with as you move your phone and it's and the um there's
[01:02:06.040 --> 01:02:11.400]   not much persistence of those 3d points um now develop some developers are just grabbing onto
[01:02:11.400 --> 01:02:15.240]   those points and caching them all the time and then what you end up with is there's just a lot
[01:02:15.240 --> 01:02:19.480]   of junk data because so you have to get into this point where i'm grabbing points and keeping the
[01:02:19.480 --> 01:02:24.520]   ones that matter that have a lot of that i have a lot of um reliability you know of knowing that
[01:02:24.520 --> 01:02:29.560]   those points are really there and as i work with it i want it to keep on getting more data like
[01:02:29.560 --> 01:02:35.160]   keep on refining that data not rewriting it and so right now the lidar is rewriting it all the time
[01:02:35.160 --> 01:02:39.400]   and so you can't get the high resolution if i'm scanning you know this little switcher so i grab
[01:02:39.400 --> 01:02:44.120]   you know i grab this little switcher and i just get a certain amount of data i want to get closer
[01:02:44.120 --> 01:02:49.160]   and have it keep on you know filling in more data around the around the pieces if i want to grab
[01:02:49.160 --> 01:02:54.360]   that model uh the other side of that is also photogrammetry and i think it's either apple providing
[01:02:54.360 --> 01:02:59.080]   that to the developers or or the developers taking more advantage of it because what i want to do
[01:02:59.080 --> 01:03:06.200]   is take this and as i move around it take photos of those i know exactly where that camera is because
[01:03:06.200 --> 01:03:12.680]   of the lidar and i know what camera it is because it's all on the same device now i can mix the quality
[01:03:12.680 --> 01:03:17.880]   and resolution of the image to the lidars accuracy so that's mixing what we call um
[01:03:17.880 --> 01:03:21.880]   structured and unstructured light the structured light being the lidar and the unstructured light
[01:03:21.880 --> 01:03:27.960]   being the photos and when you combine those two your ability to to basically capture incredibly
[01:03:27.960 --> 01:03:34.200]   high resolution models becomes you know much easier to manage now if you take that and you combine
[01:03:34.200 --> 01:03:39.320]   it with um USDZ which apple has you know put into motion and final cut it's in the operating
[01:03:39.320 --> 01:03:43.000]   system and they talk they've been talking about it for a couple years you're talking about the
[01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:48.040]   ability to basically the new photograph quote unquote is a 3d model you know from your from your phone
[01:03:48.040 --> 01:03:52.360]   from your ipad where you can literally i can take up if i want to show someone this i can take a
[01:03:52.360 --> 01:03:57.720]   picture of it and i can send it to them and they can put it into their presentation you know and
[01:03:57.720 --> 01:04:01.800]   rotate it around or it can be in a presentation where i just click on it like if you go to the apple's
[01:04:01.800 --> 01:04:07.400]   website right now and go USDZ samples you'll see things and when you click on those on the web page
[01:04:07.400 --> 01:04:12.600]   it pops out in front of you and it will pop out to scale you know with the with the um if you have
[01:04:12.600 --> 01:04:20.760]   an iPhone with lidar and so so you're you know the if you think about why you know amazon for instance
[01:04:20.760 --> 01:04:25.800]   being able to look at any object in amazon and click on it and have it pop out on your table in
[01:04:25.800 --> 01:04:30.040]   front of you and have you able to rotate it around and have it be able to annotate um how you know
[01:04:30.040 --> 01:04:35.640]   all those things are it's going to come to all the platforms but apple's probably got the ability to
[01:04:36.920 --> 01:04:40.440]   put it all together a little bit more effectively than everybody else at the moment
[01:04:40.440 --> 01:04:46.840]   and so um so with that it's an incredible mix of of all of these technologies that are all that
[01:04:46.840 --> 01:04:51.240]   all feel like they're coming together at a at a point sometime in the next couple years
[01:04:51.240 --> 01:04:58.360]   Andy you said you wanted us to start a new topic no no i'm i'm at no on the on the ipad that
[01:04:58.360 --> 01:05:03.320]   obviously 5g on the ipad pro would be an awesome thing oh of course i'll have 5g
[01:05:03.960 --> 01:05:09.000]   the only question is whether the ceo verizon will show up yeah he'll tell you to no he'll tell you
[01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:12.520]   to turn it off and i'll delete the tweet yeah isn't that funny isn't that funny i don't really
[01:05:12.520 --> 01:05:18.120]   have Verizon support said yeah what do they what do they say for better better not 5g to pro yeah
[01:05:18.120 --> 01:05:25.320]   it's a turn off 5g they said turn on lt yes switch to lt yeah um which of course turns off like
[01:05:25.320 --> 01:05:33.560]   the data 5g in america sorry leo uh it is unfortunately um so good i think uh it'd be interesting to see new
[01:05:33.560 --> 01:05:39.560]   ipad pro uh new camera anything different the cameras they seem to incrementally improve the
[01:05:39.560 --> 01:05:45.720]   cameras a little bit they did last year yep never is there's no room always better than the last
[01:05:45.720 --> 01:05:51.160]   ipad yeah yeah i mean they have they have a room there and processing it's kind of a bummer that
[01:05:51.160 --> 01:05:55.160]   they don't make those just incredible cameras you can do the ancel adam's thing where they have
[01:05:55.160 --> 01:05:59.960]   it's like the big big image and if they could just figure out the zone system i'd be happy it's just
[01:05:59.960 --> 01:06:04.200]   it's bill of goods for them like they they don't want to a more expensive camera makes the ipad
[01:06:04.200 --> 01:06:07.240]   more expensive they already think it's expensive so they just weigh everything that they can put
[01:06:07.240 --> 01:06:12.440]   into it for that price yeah but it's still thinking i just wish they had like with the iphone you know
[01:06:12.440 --> 01:06:15.560]   that just to have this like we're not going to worry about the price as much you know on the top
[01:06:15.560 --> 01:06:20.360]   end and we're just going to do what we need to do to yeah just do like yeah the one like the ipad
[01:06:20.360 --> 01:06:26.520]   pro pro the pro plus ipad ipad pro match extreme but when you know like magic has this they have the
[01:06:26.520 --> 01:06:30.840]   atem mini the atem mini pro the atem mini extremes it could be the ipad for people who have more money
[01:06:30.840 --> 01:06:36.040]   than sense here's the all for years like who had no constraints we said to the designers
[01:06:36.040 --> 01:06:41.240]   just this is the form factor what can you do he said what could be do with new constraints what
[01:06:41.240 --> 01:06:46.440]   i'm thinking we like wow wouldn't it be even cooler if you have if you have an i if you have a an
[01:06:46.440 --> 01:06:52.120]   iphone 12 pro and you have an ipad pro to be able to use the ipad pro integrated with the phone as
[01:06:52.120 --> 01:06:57.080]   a viewfinder like even if a if you just if you want to like put this thing on a tripod and
[01:06:57.080 --> 01:07:03.400]   and be use the ipad pro as a controller and also as an image preview but also imagine
[01:07:03.400 --> 01:07:09.880]   an ipad case that actually use the ipad the iphone as an accessory so you would have
[01:07:09.880 --> 01:07:15.480]   that incredible wonderful iphone quality camera because i don't it's it's weird when you think
[01:07:15.480 --> 01:07:22.600]   about how apple is trying to sell the ipad pro in a world in which they now have now they've
[01:07:22.600 --> 01:07:27.960]   actually demonstrated an interest in continuing the the macintosh moving forward it's it would be
[01:07:27.960 --> 01:07:33.640]   great to have thunderbolt on this device but at what point does apple have a problem explaining
[01:07:33.640 --> 01:07:41.320]   why you would want to get a mac instead of an ipad versus keeping the price of the ipad pro
[01:07:41.320 --> 01:07:47.720]   to a level where you can get the best one available for about as much as the cheapest possible macbook
[01:07:47.720 --> 01:07:51.880]   and it's just it's going to be the most elegant and wonderful experience for people who absolutely
[01:07:51.880 --> 01:07:57.560]   want an ipad i don't know how thunderbolt would actually do that why i i feel like if apple can
[01:07:57.560 --> 01:08:01.560]   sell you a three thousand dollar ipad if apple thinks that they can sell you a three thousand
[01:08:01.560 --> 01:08:06.120]   dollar ipad you know that they they just should like it's it's so that it's just hard to remember
[01:08:06.120 --> 01:08:10.600]   with gold accents well no but i think that if you start putting in you know really high resolution
[01:08:10.600 --> 01:08:14.840]   cameras and you know i i do think that we'll probably see better support for keyboard and mouse and
[01:08:14.840 --> 01:08:18.440]   other things like that because i think they are you know there there is this merger going on between
[01:08:18.440 --> 01:08:23.320]   the two in fact i think that at some point the ipad will pass the air and other things because
[01:08:23.320 --> 01:08:28.600]   you'll have a touch screen and uh and all the other things that you want you know a modular
[01:08:28.600 --> 01:08:32.760]   whether you want to use a keyboard or not in a mouse and so it's pretty close now yeah i agree
[01:08:32.760 --> 01:08:37.640]   yeah so we're there's some point where the ipad just becomes better than the low end macbooks
[01:08:37.640 --> 01:08:42.200]   you know and then um you know it's a different experience if you really want your laptop
[01:08:42.200 --> 01:08:47.800]   experience you can have it um some of the more powerful max will be still a reason to use them
[01:08:47.800 --> 01:08:52.920]   but i think that i think that at some point the ipad becomes the macbook macbook air so the front
[01:08:52.920 --> 01:09:01.720]   facing camera right now on the current the latest ipad pro isn't the wrong place yes besides being
[01:09:01.720 --> 01:09:10.440]   yes it is again with my mom lover but she's always looking at yeah it's wicked side-eye it's
[01:09:10.440 --> 01:09:15.960]   unintentional wicked side-eye yeah and so i never and and i've tried but i give up you know mom the
[01:09:15.960 --> 01:09:20.280]   camera's there it's on the side there where's the camera i don't see it well it's black dot you
[01:09:20.280 --> 01:09:24.120]   can't see it but put your thumb over the left side across and she'll do that and say that's where
[01:09:24.120 --> 01:09:27.400]   the camera is and for about five minutes she'll look at that and then she'll go back to looking at
[01:09:27.400 --> 01:09:31.160]   the screen and so it shouldn't be her problem it's not apple should like they've been making these
[01:09:31.160 --> 01:09:36.760]   keyboards for five years six years now yeah so uh i guess someday they'll have a through the
[01:09:36.760 --> 01:09:41.160]   screen camera and then it could be right smack dab in the middle where it's just probably the only
[01:09:41.160 --> 01:09:47.880]   good spot for but i'm given that i think the ipad might be the perfect you know video meeting
[01:09:47.880 --> 01:09:53.480]   device i'm gonna defer to alex on this he's the king of zoom all right it can't be put a good
[01:09:53.480 --> 01:09:58.680]   camera in if you put a good camera in wouldn't it be like what everybody would want to use for school
[01:09:58.680 --> 01:10:05.000]   for work for meetings uh it is the i mean the hard part is is that that uh if you're really
[01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:09.960]   serious about meetings you don't use wifi because wifi oh there you go you need to use their net yeah
[01:10:09.960 --> 01:10:14.200]   yeah so so you end up with you know and we we get a lot of people that we just did an event last week
[01:10:14.200 --> 01:10:19.000]   and and it had two people on ipads and there's a couple problems one is is that zoom has a bug
[01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:24.280]   where they don't they take the whole sensor not the they don't crop in a little bit the way skype
[01:10:24.280 --> 01:10:28.840]   does and a face-time and everything else so you end up with this weird you know pillaring that goes
[01:10:28.840 --> 01:10:35.640]   on with anybody on an ipad right um and then you know the resolution of the camera is just okay
[01:10:35.640 --> 01:10:40.280]   and then wifi breaks it up and and so it is i mean it's convenient to kind of walk around and set
[01:10:40.280 --> 01:10:45.080]   it down and and work with it and i think that to your point you could do better apple would
[01:10:45.080 --> 01:10:50.120]   probably do better if they actually made face-time usable but you know um if face-time's really great
[01:10:50.120 --> 01:10:56.600]   it just kind of like a casual i want to talk to one-on-one with folks yeah i use the ipad for
[01:10:56.600 --> 01:11:02.120]   face-time but that's my my mom's always looking excited yeah but there's no but there's no there's
[01:11:02.120 --> 01:11:09.320]   no good controls and the the group chat thing is a disaster yeah just just completely unusable so
[01:11:09.320 --> 01:11:16.120]   that's something apple could look at though given the world we live in um i have this is from pluggable
[01:11:16.680 --> 01:11:21.080]   this is the dong my dongle i actually was going through my dongles just to see this dongle has
[01:11:21.080 --> 01:11:28.680]   ethernet on it so i i presume i could use ethernet with my ipad it also has absolutely yeah we use
[01:11:28.680 --> 01:11:32.920]   we use ethernet with our ipads all the time and it has new cmi it has a bunch of this actually
[01:11:32.920 --> 01:11:36.440]   is a great dongle i should make it a great day of the week yeah because it is everything on it
[01:11:36.440 --> 01:11:43.320]   um including an SD card reader so yeah that turns kind of you put something like that on ipad pro
[01:11:43.320 --> 01:11:47.080]   that's pretty impressive and you could the hard part is is that apple keeps on selling us on the
[01:11:47.080 --> 01:11:52.200]   fact that we just we can just do it with wirelessly we don't need a bunch of things and the reality
[01:11:52.200 --> 01:11:58.440]   is is that you know um yeah Wi-Fi does Wi-Fi 6 solve that a little bit fragile is it better
[01:11:58.440 --> 01:12:05.320]   Wi-Fi 6E what is the better one Wi-Fi 6E is the new one yeah but i think that's not the issue
[01:12:05.320 --> 01:12:10.600]   it's the issues it's collision based right Alex that at least that's the issue i think we pinpointed
[01:12:10.600 --> 01:12:15.880]   i mean the the what we you know from folks that we've talked to the real problem is that the ap's
[01:12:15.880 --> 01:12:20.440]   are just really chatty they they talk with literally every device yes that they can see and there and
[01:12:20.440 --> 01:12:24.280]   so the so everything that walks in and out so like for instance if i'm at my parents house i
[01:12:24.280 --> 01:12:28.520]   actually get great Wi-Fi and i don't have any problems because not a lot of things are going in
[01:12:28.520 --> 01:12:33.800]   and out of the the Wi-Fi zone it's just when you're in any kind of congested area where there's a lot
[01:12:33.800 --> 01:12:37.720]   of other ap's there's a lot of other devices or and we have more and more devices doing this
[01:12:38.360 --> 01:12:42.200]   they're constantly talking to all those devices and just dropping packets now when you're surfing
[01:12:42.200 --> 01:12:47.160]   you don't notice it at all but in synchronous video where you know you're at less than 200 milliseconds
[01:12:47.160 --> 01:12:51.640]   you you just lose frames you know and that's what so there's this kind of constant
[01:12:51.640 --> 01:12:56.680]   um dropping of frames and dropping of packets that that's going on that you know a lot of people
[01:12:56.680 --> 01:13:00.440]   don't notice but it's kind of one of those things that there's a lot of things you may not notice
[01:13:00.440 --> 01:13:07.640]   that make you uncomfortable you know so so it's it's part of what drags down video conferencing
[01:13:07.640 --> 01:13:15.880]   it's windy. such an opportunity um i think for the iPad uh because it's because the form factor
[01:13:15.880 --> 01:13:22.120]   it's light it's um well if you look at like the the possibility of being able to really share your
[01:13:22.120 --> 01:13:26.520]   camera with someone but then also being able to share objects with each other and annotate the
[01:13:26.520 --> 01:13:29.880]   things and and look at those things in real time and there's a lot of places that we could have
[01:13:29.880 --> 01:13:33.880]   really interesting interactions with each other that none none of the tools are supporting right
[01:13:33.880 --> 01:13:39.480]   now um and uh it'd be easy for it wouldn't be easy but it would be something that apple could
[01:13:39.480 --> 01:13:45.240]   has a unique position to do um that hopefully that they they take they take seriously yeah i don't
[01:13:45.240 --> 01:13:48.440]   think they really understand video conferencing so i think that's part of the problem now i stand
[01:13:48.440 --> 01:13:53.720]   pointing. Alex you don't think anybody understands video conferencing except for the office hours crew
[01:13:53.720 --> 01:13:59.000]   and you're probably right i mean you're the king of this you i mean i think that you see things that
[01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:06.200]   know when i i not to not to diminish your expertise it's that you're exactly right but but uh i wish
[01:14:06.200 --> 01:14:10.440]   companies would come to you and say what should we do because you know i think i think you know i
[01:14:10.440 --> 01:14:15.640]   think there are some companies that are doing a pretty good job i mean we we get we get to talk to
[01:14:15.640 --> 01:14:20.280]   a couple of them good so they should they should listen here's a guy who's you know the cutting edge
[01:14:20.280 --> 01:14:30.040]   of this stuff and uh you know for years um uh okay one other rumor i don't know if it's true apple tv
[01:14:30.040 --> 01:14:36.680]   will there be an apple tv in the next few weeks before the end of the month rene what do you think
[01:14:36.680 --> 01:14:40.760]   i hope so yeah i think it's highly likely you know apparently it was ready last year and they
[01:14:40.760 --> 01:14:46.760]   didn't push it out for a a variety of reasons but i'm mostly curious if they go for the timid
[01:14:46.760 --> 01:14:50.920]   upgrade because there's been two rumored versions of it one is a timid upgrade that would go to an
[01:14:50.920 --> 01:14:56.680]   a12x that would let it do better hdr compositing and play apple arcade gaming and the other rumor
[01:14:56.680 --> 01:15:01.720]   tv yeah yeah well no i mean i think that one is the conservative apple tv that's more of the apple
[01:15:01.720 --> 01:15:08.920]   tv like the the tv watching uh apple arcade sort of um not super different what's the right word
[01:15:08.920 --> 01:15:13.160]   yeah not super demanding at all and the other rumors that apple's gonna go to an a14x which would
[01:15:13.160 --> 01:15:18.120]   raise the price which i think is a huge concern because apples tried doing higher-end apple tv's
[01:15:18.120 --> 01:15:22.360]   internally before and people were worried that they were too expensive but any apple tv is too
[01:15:22.360 --> 01:15:27.480]   expensive now so i would rather apple either make like a little dongle like a fire stick or a chrome
[01:15:27.480 --> 01:15:32.840]   cast stick for people for whom they want to have a low price point and then make a box that is really
[01:15:32.840 --> 01:15:37.800]   interesting that does that is an a14x it's been rumors they're talking to game studios about doing
[01:15:37.800 --> 01:15:43.320]   a lot more game support about maybe bundling in an apple designed controller even and then use it
[01:15:43.320 --> 01:15:48.600]   as like that staging device for the vr headsets in the future where they really go to high quality
[01:15:48.600 --> 01:15:54.600]   gaming high quality entertainment education fitness that sort of stuff and there's i'm really
[01:15:54.600 --> 01:16:00.520]   interested to watch the trend of uh 120 hertz you know so you know the you know where there's rumors
[01:16:00.520 --> 01:16:05.720]   that the phone this fall will be at 120 uh frame or you know the the display will be at 120 hertz
[01:16:05.720 --> 01:16:10.280]   that's the refresh on the screen yeah that's the that's the but it's 120 frames per second right so
[01:16:10.280 --> 01:16:15.160]   we're mostly looking at 30 frames a second streaming 60 frames per second for you know gaming but
[01:16:15.160 --> 01:16:21.640]   what if you have a gaming console and a video console and and the phones all able to work at
[01:16:21.640 --> 01:16:28.520]   120 frames a second um now so far that hasn't been super successful for folks because they because
[01:16:28.520 --> 01:16:32.840]   people just aren't used to looking at that and people say oh that just looks like tv you know like
[01:16:32.840 --> 01:16:38.920]   when you're watching a film but the issue is is that the it's the way that the tv converts 24 frames
[01:16:38.920 --> 01:16:43.880]   a second to to 120 that really is the problem right now we could shoot 120 but we can't display
[01:16:43.880 --> 01:16:49.880]   it anywhere so with apple with what they own right now i think what's really it what the the
[01:16:49.880 --> 01:16:53.880]   spaces that they could affect if they wanted to and i don't know if apple's gonna do this at all but
[01:16:53.880 --> 01:17:01.880]   if you have 120 frame per second capable device to put it out to the tv if you have um cameras on
[01:17:01.880 --> 01:17:07.160]   the phones and the ipads that are able to capture 120 frames per second and if you started generating
[01:17:07.160 --> 01:17:11.880]   content and i i would not say film content but let's say if you look at the nature content that apple
[01:17:11.880 --> 01:17:16.600]   does which is the apple that's the best part of apple tv plus in my opinion is there nature stuff
[01:17:16.600 --> 01:17:23.240]   has just been outstanding um if you can imagine a device able to do 4k or even 8k at 120 frames a
[01:17:23.240 --> 01:17:30.200]   second um it may not be this version but if if you if you go down that path you start creating
[01:17:30.200 --> 01:17:35.080]   something that almost nobody else can create like you know they just and i think that that's
[01:17:35.080 --> 01:17:39.560]   where you're gonna we're gonna keep on seeing apple go down that path where you know we're
[01:17:39.560 --> 01:17:44.920]   gonna make everybody play games that that only we play well you know like there's more
[01:17:44.920 --> 01:17:52.680]   infections over apple tv inside apple that there's the the just a hobby group that doesn't want to
[01:17:52.680 --> 01:17:56.440]   do too much doesn't want to make it too expensive they look at roku it's that less than half
[01:17:57.240 --> 01:18:02.200]   an apple tv uh and it's the best seller and they go that's where we should be going we should be
[01:18:02.200 --> 01:18:07.560]   going with a low-end consumer product that's wider spread and especially given apples now devotion
[01:18:07.560 --> 01:18:12.760]   to services you want to get apple tv and plus in more hands and arcade in more hands and so
[01:18:12.760 --> 01:18:19.320]   forth and then i figure there is a a group probably genetically related to Alex Lindsey
[01:18:19.320 --> 01:18:25.800]   we're saying just think what we could do with this set top box if it were five hundred dollars and
[01:18:25.800 --> 01:18:30.840]   that you know i think there's a group of apple uh fans who would pay five hundred bucks for a tv
[01:18:30.840 --> 01:18:35.640]   box that's all those amazing things i actually think that the biggest challenge to all of that is
[01:18:35.640 --> 01:18:41.160]   that apple has made you know the airplay and other things available on the on tv's you know on uh
[01:18:41.160 --> 01:18:47.160]   yeah apple tv is available on tv's now and that's actually if anything else that that's the lowest
[01:18:47.160 --> 01:18:51.560]   kind of well the problem is it holds them back because now you have backwards compatibility issues
[01:18:51.560 --> 01:18:54.840]   but you could get to a point where and this would drive the tv manufacturers crazy is
[01:18:55.800 --> 01:19:01.880]   you can get 30 60 30 or 60 frames a second on those tv's but if you if it knows that you have
[01:19:01.880 --> 01:19:06.360]   120 frames a second or if it knows those things it'll just maybe make an apple tv pro or something
[01:19:06.360 --> 01:19:10.840]   like that that is a different i think that was their answer to the apple tv stick like instead of
[01:19:10.840 --> 01:19:14.440]   making an apple tv stick which i still wish they'd make because i want to travel with one they just
[01:19:14.440 --> 01:19:18.840]   put that the app they made the app ubiquitous and maybe they'll do more of that but the the answer
[01:19:18.840 --> 01:19:23.000]   to the top end i don't know if it's still the same but the rumor was previously like there was a
[01:19:23.800 --> 01:19:28.440]   three years in the desert where there was no new apple tv hardware before the future of apps or apps
[01:19:28.440 --> 01:19:35.160]   so the future of tv is apps when we got the new apple tv for before the 4k and you know supposedly
[01:19:35.160 --> 01:19:39.240]   eddy was really interested in it but there was a layer of middle management that just couldn't
[01:19:39.240 --> 01:19:43.880]   come to turn with it like they figured out we're gonna try a dr like a d the dvr box no we're
[01:19:43.880 --> 01:19:48.760]   gonna try a high end gaming console no we're gonna try a low end thing and they they just kept not
[01:19:48.760 --> 01:19:52.920]   doing what he asked for them to do and it took cycles and cycles to to figure out what was wrong
[01:19:52.920 --> 01:19:57.240]   and fix it and finally they went with what all of us just wanted and that was like a version of
[01:19:57.240 --> 01:20:02.040]   ios that ran on the tv and let us use all sorts of apps and it still managed to screw that up by
[01:20:02.040 --> 01:20:07.160]   using by forcing the syria controller and on-demand resources to all the developers who were gonna
[01:20:07.160 --> 01:20:11.640]   make apps for them anyway so i think that was just a huge missed opportunity and it's it's unclear
[01:20:11.640 --> 01:20:17.320]   if they'll recapture it but we just saw microsoft clear the bethesta transaction today and
[01:20:17.320 --> 01:20:22.200]   microsoft and sony are buying up a lot of the game uh franchises and collateral and everything out
[01:20:22.200 --> 01:20:27.080]   there and if the other rumor is true that apple is going to get into either like amping up uh
[01:20:27.080 --> 01:20:31.800]   apple or k-games getting apple or k-games to the triple a level or investing in studios of their
[01:20:31.800 --> 01:20:37.000]   own or properties of their own then i think that they start to justify that hardware i don't think
[01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:42.440]   they can compete with an xbox or a playstation even with an a14x i think it does different things than
[01:20:42.440 --> 01:20:47.720]   the amd socs that are in those next generation consoles but i think it'll start to get them there
[01:20:47.720 --> 01:20:52.120]   especially as they go into more premium entertainment and gaming actually i guess the high end competition
[01:20:52.120 --> 01:20:58.840]   really is the invidious shield uh which i have in love uh and it's like three hundred dollars so
[01:20:58.840 --> 01:21:03.160]   it's right kind of in the middle of just an xbox and a playstation five and that's the next step up
[01:21:03.160 --> 01:21:10.040]   absolutely yeah if you have an xbox uh and you've got a h- uh uh-d-d-d player in it you've got apple tv
[01:21:10.040 --> 01:21:16.840]   app on it yeah maybe maybe yeah Alex have you ever tried the invidious shield i haven't tried it
[01:21:16.840 --> 01:21:23.160]   yeah i'm curious what you would think about it uh Dolby vision atmos uh but it also does uh what
[01:21:23.160 --> 01:21:28.920]   they call ai upscaling uh to 4k which actually is kind of interesting it does a pretty good job and
[01:21:28.920 --> 01:21:35.400]   then of course it's 4k htr i don't know what the frame rate is of it but i would imagine given its
[01:21:35.400 --> 01:21:40.680]   cost it's really a show-off piece for invidia for their tagridship it's not i don't i doubt they
[01:21:40.680 --> 01:21:46.040]   sold more than you know a hundred thousand of them but uh those of us who have them love them
[01:21:46.040 --> 01:21:51.320]   yeah yeah i've had the 2017 version for three or four years and it is upgrading it has a
[01:21:51.320 --> 01:21:56.360]   priority point yeah the beauty of it that's the exact thing exactly and the the the shield pro
[01:21:56.360 --> 01:22:01.160]   which has all the upscaling uh 4k upscaling and uh that you talked about it's only 200 bucks 200 bucks
[01:22:01.160 --> 01:22:05.560]   so it's a little more than an apple tv that's all yeah i mean that if there's one i really can't
[01:22:05.560 --> 01:22:11.560]   point to one thing that i hope that a new apple tv would have apart from a reason to exist because
[01:22:11.560 --> 01:22:16.120]   this is one of the saddest parts of the entire product line for apple there's no reason for this
[01:22:16.120 --> 01:22:21.960]   thing to exist there is of it's a very very hard sale for somebody else for somebody who's not a fan
[01:22:21.960 --> 01:22:28.200]   of technology to say give us give apple close to a couple hundred bucks they will give you what well
[01:22:28.200 --> 01:22:33.560]   it will be able to play youtube videos and play netflix while i get that free on my tv anyway
[01:22:33.560 --> 01:22:36.600]   well you'll be able to play games oh it will be as good as on my phone
[01:22:36.600 --> 01:22:41.880]   not quite but it'll be on a big screen like oh but but i bet you have all kinds of exclusive game
[01:22:41.880 --> 01:22:47.640]   titles no no we don't really also the the remote control kind of sucks i mean you talk about
[01:22:47.640 --> 01:22:54.440]   they're here you have the shield tv pro 200 bucks and it is so powerful you can actually
[01:22:54.440 --> 01:22:59.400]   you don't you don't just run plex on it you can run a plex media server on it it can
[01:22:59.400 --> 01:23:05.640]   this box can record dvr content it can it can have like terabytes of your movies and music on it and
[01:23:05.640 --> 01:23:10.360]   serve it to any place anywhere in the world that's the answer to why are you spending 200 bucks
[01:23:10.360 --> 01:23:16.520]   worth in any dicks in addition to getting access to streaming gaming libraries at the other hand
[01:23:16.520 --> 01:23:23.240]   you have you have roku's stick you have google's chrome cast all which costs under 50 bucks and
[01:23:23.240 --> 01:23:28.680]   they do they do terrific jobs for it they do a job that is very much just as good as the apple tv
[01:23:28.680 --> 01:23:34.760]   so that's why i just want to see that apple has a reason for this to exist apart from hey look
[01:23:34.760 --> 01:23:39.480]   it's got an apple logo on it you love the apple logo don't you give us next 100 bucks and you can
[01:23:39.480 --> 01:23:44.280]   have your 50 dollar stick with an apple logo on it if there's one thing i've always thought that
[01:23:44.280 --> 01:23:51.080]   would be a great move for for the apple tv is to kind of it will always be an hg my box you plug
[01:23:51.080 --> 01:23:56.920]   into a tv but its role inside the apple hardware universe is that it is the apple computer that
[01:23:56.920 --> 01:24:02.600]   is always switched on and always kind of the internet 24/7 and you think about all the things
[01:24:02.600 --> 01:24:09.160]   that that kind of advice could do including things like a a version of back to my mac where
[01:24:09.160 --> 01:24:14.280]   it doesn't matter what kind of device you have if it's an apple device it will make a software
[01:24:14.280 --> 01:24:19.480]   that's built into both the phone the the tablet and the and the mac will make sure that you could
[01:24:19.480 --> 01:24:23.720]   basically airplay a screen to wherever you are from wherever you're going to be
[01:24:23.720 --> 01:24:29.640]   that kind of stuff is interesting the ability to act as a router or as a filter for internet
[01:24:29.640 --> 01:24:34.760]   content to control your privacy that would be a nice thing if that was part of a suite of always
[01:24:34.760 --> 01:24:40.440]   on activities but as it is it's the one it's the one thing i think of the entire apple lineup
[01:24:40.440 --> 01:24:44.760]   where i have to say there's really no reason to buy it i would i would encourage you instead of
[01:24:44.760 --> 01:24:49.480]   buying one of these by three dongles so you can have a connectivity for all the tv's in your house
[01:24:49.480 --> 01:24:54.600]   even the one in the kitchen and i think that for me i mean i haven't had anything other than an
[01:24:54.600 --> 01:24:59.400]   apple tv for one i mean i've had everything and then i just stopped when i moved into this house
[01:24:59.400 --> 01:25:03.960]   a couple years ago that was the last time i plugged anything else in so i just i agree i tell people
[01:25:03.960 --> 01:25:09.320]   what's the best get the apple tv it's you know here the thing is is that is that from a privacy
[01:25:09.320 --> 01:25:13.480]   perspective i don't let my tv's actually talk to the internet i'm like not interested in that process
[01:25:13.480 --> 01:25:20.280]   and so and so my apple tv is that interface and i think that and so i i trust apple more than any
[01:25:20.280 --> 01:25:26.120]   of the other dongles to only do what it needs to do and constantly trying to to keep to keep
[01:25:26.120 --> 01:25:32.600]   my information private and so so i think that and and i think that it is right it could be better
[01:25:32.600 --> 01:25:37.800]   it's good absolutely i mean i hate the controller i hate the controller and i hate the you know and
[01:25:37.800 --> 01:25:41.880]   all i need i literally only need the trackpad at the top when i don't need all the other buttons
[01:25:41.880 --> 01:25:45.560]   i just wish people would stop using them so that i could just use that top piece i don't need in the
[01:25:45.560 --> 01:25:52.120]   other parts and and so the the um uh so i think that that's it i do think that there's an opportunity
[01:25:52.120 --> 01:25:59.240]   for i mean part of it is also that gets a little mashed up is that as an apple user i have i want
[01:25:59.240 --> 01:26:03.640]   everything connected to my dot me account and not have to do all this logging and putting in little
[01:26:03.640 --> 01:26:08.040]   codes and doing all the weird stuff i just wanted to work and they now tie in your cable job they
[01:26:08.040 --> 01:26:11.720]   tie into your cable company so there's a lot less password entering than they're used to
[01:26:11.720 --> 01:26:15.640]   i don't even want my cable i don't want the cable company thing i just want i literally want i
[01:26:15.640 --> 01:26:21.160]   bought that i'm an apple user yeah living the app's only custom no where well like i want i and i
[01:26:21.160 --> 01:26:29.000]   am not like it and i'm not quite there but usually when something is asking me to register to
[01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:34.760]   you know register to their system and not just use my apple id i just go like this better be
[01:26:34.760 --> 01:26:39.400]   really good or i'm gonna quit like you know like i'm you know like it's like it's it's gonna i'm not
[01:26:39.400 --> 01:26:44.920]   gonna even i don't even go over that hump anymore and so uh you know like i if it's for work like
[01:26:44.920 --> 01:26:49.320]   title is a disaster you know like you can't figure out like i you know like it the way that
[01:26:49.320 --> 01:26:55.320]   they've implemented is just such a pain you know and and so um so those are good that's a good
[01:26:55.320 --> 01:26:59.720]   example of you know i just want that to smooth out and just be something that i can get connected to
[01:26:59.720 --> 01:27:04.920]   right and so so i think that i think that when as companies do that i think it's great i also
[01:27:04.920 --> 01:27:10.840]   think that there's an opportunity for the apple tv to to take that high ground of the next level
[01:27:10.840 --> 01:27:14.760]   of technology and and what's interesting is i don't even expect apple to do that usually usually
[01:27:14.760 --> 01:27:19.640]   they're behind on everything but they have because they're creating content that they're buying
[01:27:19.640 --> 01:27:23.960]   because they're creating the games that they're buying because they build the hardware because
[01:27:23.960 --> 01:27:29.480]   they build the phones because they build all this whole ecosystem their ability to innovate and say
[01:27:29.480 --> 01:27:35.880]   hey we are going to give you 8k 120 frame per second or 4k 120 frame per second or you know all they've
[01:27:35.880 --> 01:27:42.040]   already started doing the hdr and surround sound they can push that that field down the road much
[01:27:42.040 --> 01:27:49.400]   faster than everyone else nobody else can do that other than apple and and it really will you know
[01:27:49.400 --> 01:27:53.640]   then what happens as an apple user you're like well i have the best of everything because i have
[01:27:53.640 --> 01:27:58.360]   better frame rates and i have higher resolution and i have you know all of those things um and that
[01:27:58.360 --> 01:28:03.640]   you literally the other the other groups cannot put together because it requires them to all agree
[01:28:03.640 --> 01:28:07.720]   to with each other the content creators and the manufacturers and everything else all have to come
[01:28:07.720 --> 01:28:11.800]   to a consortium and apple doesn't need to do that and so i think that i i think that we will continue
[01:28:11.800 --> 01:28:15.080]   i don't know whether apple will do what i just said but i think you're going to continue to see
[01:28:15.080 --> 01:28:19.400]   apple do things that say i can we can do something that no one else can do because we don't have to
[01:28:19.400 --> 01:28:23.320]   we don't have to gather agreement we can just innovate right you know and i think that that's
[01:28:23.320 --> 01:28:29.160]   gonna be that's their that's their strongest suit when they play it yeah it's but it's always
[01:28:29.160 --> 01:28:34.680]   going to be about content not about technological capabilities i don't care i don't care about 8k
[01:28:34.680 --> 01:28:39.960]   120 frames per second if it's like a tv show that i've or a movie that i have no interest in whatsoever
[01:28:39.960 --> 01:28:44.200]   it's always gonna be it's always going to be about content and never about the technology absolutely
[01:28:44.200 --> 01:28:48.040]   which is why they have a whole but i mean now that they have a whole student you that's why you can't
[01:28:48.040 --> 01:28:54.600]   just do it as a if you're not buying that content you can't they have to have apple tv the apple tv
[01:28:54.600 --> 01:29:03.560]   plus content be good you know but i think that uh so that but but generating that content through
[01:29:03.560 --> 01:29:08.040]   the games and through apple tv plus is part of the puzzle and they have to get that right
[01:29:08.040 --> 01:29:13.240]   but they have to get that right either way but if you combine that with it's great content that
[01:29:13.240 --> 01:29:17.720]   there was great actors and great directors and everything else and oh by the way it happens to be
[01:29:17.720 --> 01:29:23.720]   the best representation like as good or better than going to the theater that is something that
[01:29:23.720 --> 01:29:30.040]   also attracts the talent so you know if if uh a martin scorsese knows or you know or or someone
[01:29:30.040 --> 01:29:35.400]   else knows that it's going to be like it's never going to look as good as it as it looks on apple tv
[01:29:35.400 --> 01:29:42.680]   you know they're gonna that helps drive acceptance of of them working with the platform as well so
[01:29:42.680 --> 01:29:47.080]   that's that's part of it i just i don't think you're necessarily wrong i just think you're overstating
[01:29:47.080 --> 01:29:51.480]   it i think that it's you still you still the bottleneck of how many of your subscribers have
[01:29:51.480 --> 01:29:56.520]   TVs that will be able to take advantage of that kind of frame rate and that kind of technology
[01:29:56.520 --> 01:29:59.240]   that's that's all i'm saying the frame the frame is the challenge i think that's i think it's
[01:29:59.240 --> 01:30:03.720]   i think it's limiting i think you want you want to put your your energy and your money into getting
[01:30:03.720 --> 01:30:10.360]   babylon five uh it's and when you're fighting when you're fighting against disney who owns damn
[01:30:10.360 --> 01:30:15.640]   everything and you have to figure out how you're going to get people excited about the content that's
[01:30:15.640 --> 01:30:21.400]   on your on your device or so and i think that and i think that the the interesting thing though is that
[01:30:21.400 --> 01:30:27.080]   is that you know at the trajectory we're going you know it's going to be you know 8k TVs are
[01:30:27.080 --> 01:30:32.040]   going to cost what 4k TVs cost right now by next year you know and so the resolutions there have
[01:30:32.040 --> 01:30:37.240]   really fallen i mean 4k's are nothing now and so in 8k's it's at 4k old days are
[01:30:37.240 --> 01:30:42.600]   still rapidly becoming a standard i think more people than you realize they have high quality tv's
[01:30:42.600 --> 01:30:47.960]   now again the 8k is no point in having a great picture if it's like crappy showing
[01:30:47.960 --> 01:30:52.760]   yeah but that's the problem for the manufacturers that aren't generating content apple has a content
[01:30:52.760 --> 01:30:57.240]   machine now that they can they can say we're going to start shooting and i and where i would go is not
[01:30:57.240 --> 01:31:03.080]   with the film stuff what i would be going at is the nature um you know the small world type stuff
[01:31:03.080 --> 01:31:08.440]   it'd be the first place you'd go people like hpo max who still don't have almost nothing is
[01:31:08.440 --> 01:31:15.160]   in 4k it's all 10 AP yeah i mean so it is it is it's it's both i think you're both right it's got to be
[01:31:15.160 --> 01:31:21.480]   driven from both directions yeah see i think part of this is that i'm wondering how how much more
[01:31:21.480 --> 01:31:29.480]   i'm wondering how important 4k is 8k is going to be compared to 4k because hd was a hugely forward
[01:31:29.480 --> 01:31:36.360]   4k was not as big of a leap forward but something you could appreciate 8k you're starting to get to
[01:31:36.360 --> 01:31:39.960]   the point of i agree unless unless unless you've got
[01:31:39.960 --> 01:31:44.520]   how guys can't solve yeah exactly it's not something that is not something that in a showroom you can
[01:31:44.520 --> 01:31:51.320]   really get into the hdr frankly hdr is more important hdr is much hdr and zone based lighting
[01:31:51.320 --> 01:31:57.400]   backlighting is there are much much bigger things than than one uh 8k at this point i mean the the
[01:31:57.400 --> 01:32:04.840]   all i can say is that once you've seen 8k 120 frame per second hdr when you when you combine those
[01:32:04.840 --> 01:32:09.640]   three things together it is like looking out of a window like it is just like looking at out of a
[01:32:09.640 --> 01:32:14.360]   it's like a window in your house that goes out to the outside world and you there's some
[01:32:14.360 --> 01:32:18.440]   combination of what those are that it like for instance if that fills your periphery you will
[01:32:18.440 --> 01:32:22.840]   start feeling any camera motion starts to make your stomach pull in you know and so and that is
[01:32:22.840 --> 01:32:29.240]   an entirely it just shifts an entirely different gear in your head um at least that's been my
[01:32:29.240 --> 01:32:35.800]   experience of looking at that kind of footage is that your brain literally processes it completely
[01:32:35.800 --> 01:32:43.000]   differently that does regular video or film and and so um so i think that there is this point
[01:32:43.000 --> 01:32:47.720]   where that when we go over that hump there's going to be a group of things that are coming out and
[01:32:47.720 --> 01:32:51.240]   again i think it makes more sense i think you actually have to shoot differently because i
[01:32:51.240 --> 01:32:55.880]   i have found that that at that resolution and frame rate i get uncomfortable when they're the
[01:32:55.880 --> 01:32:59.720]   edits are too fast yeah you know like it and so and but the places that that's going to make a
[01:32:59.720 --> 01:33:06.200]   difference if they can figure that part out is uh sports nature you know like football at 8k on an
[01:33:06.200 --> 01:33:12.440]   85 inch you know 8k screen you know with surround and everything else that you know an hdr will be a
[01:33:12.440 --> 01:33:19.240]   thing like people will uh you know it it will be as good as you know for many people as good as being
[01:33:19.240 --> 01:33:23.720]   there you know that's the bad but apples up getting exclusive on that so it's good they're gonna be
[01:33:23.720 --> 01:33:29.720]   chasing every single other person who now has an $80 dongle that does 4k 8k 120 frames per second
[01:33:29.720 --> 01:33:34.200]   but that the the amount of horsepower required to do it is pretty high you can't it's going to be
[01:33:34.200 --> 01:33:38.200]   hard the thing is is that's the advantage of doing it is because you can't put it into a dongle
[01:33:38.200 --> 01:33:44.520]   let me take a look at it in there is something that's not a rumor that is news but we'll talk
[01:33:44.520 --> 01:33:50.120]   about that in just sec Renee Richie Alex Lindsey Andy Anaco you're watching Mac Break Weekly
[01:33:50.120 --> 01:33:57.160]   brought to you by Sandisk I love my Sandisk's I'll tell you what let me show you I have a couple
[01:33:57.160 --> 01:34:02.680]   of new Sandisk uh drives Sandisk data storage solutions have always been among my favorites but
[01:34:02.680 --> 01:34:10.440]   this is this is so cool this is the iExpand flash it's called the iExpand flash drive Lux
[01:34:10.440 --> 01:34:15.640]   you know Sandisk USB stuff has always been fantastic but what is cool about this watch
[01:34:15.640 --> 01:34:20.280]   so it's got a Type-C connector on this side but watch watch this whoa I flipped it around
[01:34:20.280 --> 01:34:29.080]   and now it's a lightning port I plug it into my iPhone and all of a sudden I can back up directly
[01:34:29.080 --> 01:34:38.520]   from my iPhone using the Sandisk app which is incredible backup if you want photos as soon as I
[01:34:38.520 --> 01:34:43.880]   plug it in I'm backing up all my contacts you see you can back up I love it because it's backing
[01:34:43.880 --> 01:34:53.000]   up photos from iCloud as well it can back up all of your data if you want directly to a USB device
[01:34:53.000 --> 01:35:00.920]   they come in 64 128 or 256 gigs and then flip it around plug it into your iPad plug it into your
[01:35:00.920 --> 01:35:07.240]   MacBook anything with the Type-C connector so those of us who live in the in the Mac world
[01:35:07.240 --> 01:35:14.680]   want to move data around from all of our devices having that lightning on one end and the Type-C
[01:35:14.680 --> 01:35:23.240]   on the other end is fantastic of course it's fast it is a USB 3.1 I've already got all my contacts
[01:35:23.240 --> 01:35:29.160]   backed up I could back up my photos too if I want I mean this is just incredible and you can view
[01:35:29.160 --> 01:35:36.920]   the files you can see my camera all backup contacts music photos videos it's got a secure access
[01:35:36.920 --> 01:35:43.000]   program you could put on your Mac as well this is just fantastic and then unplug it
[01:35:43.000 --> 01:35:48.600]   plug it into your I love it that I could do this with it frankly with the iPad Pro is really nice
[01:35:48.600 --> 01:35:53.080]   to have that Type-C connector on the iPad Pro this is a must-have for anybody who's got an iPhone
[01:35:54.200 --> 01:35:59.480]   who's got a Mac who's got anything that you want to move data around it's the two-in-one drive
[01:35:59.480 --> 01:36:06.760]   from Sandisk right now it's 15% off your first order actually it's more than just this drive
[01:36:06.760 --> 01:36:13.560]   there's other Sandisk features Sandisk products on the web page at Sandisk.com/MacbreakSandisk
[01:36:13.560 --> 01:36:22.120]   S-A-N-D-I-S-K dot com slash Mac break this is such a good idea and so useful for anybody who's got
[01:36:22.120 --> 01:36:25.960]   stuff on their iPhone and just you know you can use iCloud to back it up it's nice to have this
[01:36:25.960 --> 01:36:31.880]   local quick easy backup and it's really good for transferring files back and forth from my iPhone
[01:36:31.880 --> 01:36:40.600]   and my Macbook Pro a two-in-one flash drive for your iPhone and USB Type-C devices get a 15% discount
[01:36:40.600 --> 01:36:49.880]   go to Sandisk.com/MacB-R-E-A-K Mac break and we thank you Sandisk for your support I really I
[01:36:49.880 --> 01:36:55.480]   actually as often as the case with Sandisk I buy about five of them so that I have them
[01:36:55.480 --> 01:37:01.080]   I want to saturate everything because they're just so darn useful I love having that.
[01:37:01.080 --> 01:37:09.160]   Let's see big I think a big story but it ties into what we were talking about might even tie into a
[01:37:09.160 --> 01:37:16.200]   March event Apple is has said we're not going to sell any more iMac Pros
[01:37:18.120 --> 01:37:21.480]   they're going to sell out there's going to be discontinued when supplies run out they're pushing
[01:37:21.480 --> 01:37:29.000]   people towards the just the regular iMac which is I guess a smart move because frankly the 27-inch
[01:37:29.000 --> 01:37:35.720]   iMac that came out in August is probably I hate to say it given I spent five grand on that iMac
[01:37:35.720 --> 01:37:41.320]   Pro probably just as good but I want to I want to interpret this a little bit differently I want
[01:37:41.320 --> 01:37:45.560]   to think that this means they're going to come up with an Apple Silicon iMac sooner than later
[01:37:46.120 --> 01:37:51.320]   and the last thing they want to do is sell an Apple Silicon iMac that is faster for half the
[01:37:51.320 --> 01:37:56.360]   price that is faster than the iMac Pro they don't they want anybody buy that iMac Pro right
[01:37:56.360 --> 01:38:04.200]   I got the one with the Z 10 core Z on because you told me to Renee and yeah that was a sweet spot
[01:38:04.200 --> 01:38:09.960]   I mean that served that's sort of served it patched the glaring gap in Apples product line
[01:38:09.960 --> 01:38:16.680]   between the 2013 Mac Pro and 2019 it's still on my it's honestly it's a long time it's still on my
[01:38:16.680 --> 01:38:22.440]   office home office desk it's a and I put 64 gigs of ram in it I mean it's it's kind of crazy I've
[01:38:22.440 --> 01:38:26.360]   got a lot of and it's ECC memory and it's the on by the way there's a lot of things that a lot
[01:38:26.360 --> 01:38:31.880]   of pros wanted back then yeah let's talk about ECC because recently Linus Torvalds the creator of
[01:38:31.880 --> 01:38:38.840]   Linux and others have started to say there is no good reason that ECC ram should be only in Pro
[01:38:38.840 --> 01:38:46.120]   devices everybody now needs ECC ram if you have spot you know weird unexplained data loss or weird
[01:38:46.120 --> 01:38:54.280]   unexplained crashes it's because in often you don't have ECC ram and there is this drum beat do you
[01:38:54.280 --> 01:39:02.520]   agree Alex you you probably only buy ECC I would guess error correcting ram yeah I mean ram is I
[01:39:02.520 --> 01:39:12.120]   think that ram is oftentimes the the biggest thing that can connects a unstable computer to a stable
[01:39:12.120 --> 01:39:17.640]   computer so there's a you know that we we spent a lot of time when we were working at both Lucas
[01:39:17.640 --> 01:39:23.640]   film and ILM this is way back of examining ram and electric image used to make a piece of software
[01:39:23.640 --> 01:39:27.240]   that would run all weekend and just check every little register in every piece of the ram we'd
[01:39:27.240 --> 01:39:32.200]   send a lot of stuff back because what we found was there's an incredible connection between
[01:39:32.200 --> 01:39:38.680]   that ram stability and everything working and our the stability and you know of our is not so much
[01:39:38.680 --> 01:39:43.080]   speed or anything else just the stability because it runs to a right stability and valid stability
[01:39:43.080 --> 01:39:50.040]   it is slower in fact right because of the air direction but but it is but a lot of times
[01:39:50.040 --> 01:39:54.040]   computers that and it's gotten so much better over the years but still that's the kind of
[01:39:54.040 --> 01:39:59.080]   ram you want to have if you're doing anything mission critical yeah Linus Turbalt like one of the
[01:39:59.080 --> 01:40:04.360]   let me read the Linus quote just because it's so good the misguided and our backward policy of
[01:40:04.360 --> 01:40:10.760]   consumers don't need ECC made the market for ECC memory go away he blames Intel the arguments
[01:40:10.760 --> 01:40:17.160]   against error correcting ram were always complete and utter garbage now even the memory manufacturers
[01:40:17.160 --> 01:40:21.880]   are starting to do ECC internally because they finally owned up to the fact they absolutely
[01:40:21.880 --> 01:40:27.800]   have to he blames Intel for all this and you could see he's flipping him off.
[01:40:27.800 --> 01:40:33.800]   He's pointing at you straight up bit flips happen Linus is he's like he's like uh DHH where they
[01:40:33.800 --> 01:40:38.280]   only have one setting for your social media posts and that's flame you know flamful on flamethrower
[01:40:38.280 --> 01:40:45.560]   it can stop the roh hammer attacks which are kind of devastating um it's just it's just the right
[01:40:45.560 --> 01:40:50.200]   thing to do so yeah so that's a good reason i would hope this apple would start looking at ECC going
[01:40:50.200 --> 01:40:52.760]   forward given the premium of bank for apple gear.
[01:40:52.760 --> 01:40:59.160]   One of the issues with this is that we have two tensions two dynamics here and one is that
[01:40:59.160 --> 01:41:03.160]   people really want affordable technology like they want we want everything we don't want to pay
[01:41:03.160 --> 01:41:07.960]   for anything and there is a sweet spot in between that but you hear a lot of times like why is an
[01:41:07.960 --> 01:41:13.080]   apple like del i don't need the best quality SSD i'll buy the super cheap one i don't need the
[01:41:13.080 --> 01:41:17.640]   best quality ram i'll buy this super cheap one you do why are they soldering the ram to the board
[01:41:17.640 --> 01:41:23.560]   and portable if i drop it and i and it gets unseated i'll take like there are a lot of things that can
[01:41:23.560 --> 01:41:28.360]   be done to make super high quality stuff but that is not the same as as like the bargain basement
[01:41:28.360 --> 01:41:32.920]   stuff that some people would really like to have as an option as well i completely agree with Linus
[01:41:32.920 --> 01:41:37.400]   i just know that as soon as it happens there'll be complaints about why do i have to get ECC ram
[01:41:37.400 --> 01:41:44.120]   why am i only getting top shelf SSDs? I think all ddr 5 is going to be ECC does but apple for
[01:41:44.120 --> 01:41:50.120]   not for instance does not offer ECC in its laptops they use really high spec like they
[01:41:50.120 --> 01:41:54.120]   they get the best of the best of everything and we pay for it and there's absolutely apple
[01:41:54.120 --> 01:41:58.040]   charge is a fortune for memory and you can get really good stuff if you're smart enough from
[01:41:58.040 --> 01:42:02.200]   you know other vendors as well but they only buy the best SSDs they only buy the best
[01:42:02.200 --> 01:42:06.680]   ram that they can source and because they're apple they can force companies to give them the
[01:42:06.680 --> 01:42:14.040]   best bin stuff yep so uh anyway i got sorry you said ECC it triggered me i'm sorry
[01:42:14.040 --> 01:42:19.400]   uh it is important and i would like to see you more and more in apples stuff because the
[01:42:19.400 --> 01:42:26.600]   reliability is important um what do you think when would we see an iMac with apple silicon in
[01:42:26.600 --> 01:42:30.760]   the first half of the year of the second half dubbed up i think dub dub PC yeah that's
[01:42:30.760 --> 01:42:35.560]   June you know what i really want i think it would get a re-event i mentioned it would get its own
[01:42:35.560 --> 01:42:39.000]   event because of its a redesign i mentioned this last week but i just want to keep saying it
[01:42:39.000 --> 01:42:44.520]   maybe it'll become true i i've decided i don't want an iMac anymore because i think that as
[01:42:44.520 --> 01:42:48.440]   great as they are the screen technology moves faster and i don't want to tie the screen to the
[01:42:48.440 --> 01:42:54.840]   processor so really what i want is a high-end mac mini will we see mac with an apple display or
[01:42:54.840 --> 01:43:00.200]   yeah and i can pair it with an apple display if i want or a 59 inch curve display if i so choose
[01:43:00.200 --> 01:43:05.800]   will we see higher-end mac minis at dub dub as well that would be a logical time yeah i think
[01:43:05.800 --> 01:43:09.720]   we'll see those the same yeah the same time because if they're going to make a processor that goes
[01:43:09.720 --> 01:43:14.360]   into the iMac that processor should go into the macbook pro and the mac mini and get another
[01:43:14.360 --> 01:43:19.640]   space gray version out there and i'd like 32 gigs of ram probably i know Alex would like uh 128 or
[01:43:19.640 --> 01:43:25.240]   128 would be great um the uh i mean but i think that the i think that apple the fact that we got a
[01:43:25.240 --> 01:43:29.480]   mac mini and it was one of the first things out there i think is a recognizing some valuable
[01:43:29.480 --> 01:43:34.280]   yeah the machines are to a lot of us especially those aren't that there isn't a server it for a
[01:43:34.280 --> 01:43:41.400]   lot of us it's the ability to um condense a lot of processors into one small place on a rack is
[01:43:41.400 --> 01:43:47.240]   is pretty valuable yeah i think that this is the roll-out strategy that we saw that we have to make
[01:43:47.240 --> 01:43:52.280]   sure that we cover every single use case that we've that we're promoting for the mac that yes if
[01:43:52.280 --> 01:43:57.240]   you if you're a desktop user we got a desktop if you're a pro user we got a macbook pro if you
[01:43:57.240 --> 01:44:00.840]   if you like the ultralight form factor here's how it works the ultralight where we're not going to
[01:44:00.840 --> 01:44:04.600]   throw we're not going to throw a fan in there we're just going to make sure we can serve as much
[01:44:04.600 --> 01:44:10.440]   power as possible that's it's the 2021 is always going to be so fascinating because this is the year
[01:44:10.440 --> 01:44:16.680]   that apple shows what this processing family can do that where there's not going to be excuses for
[01:44:16.680 --> 01:44:20.360]   only having you know one thunderbolt controllers no there's no there's no they're not going to be
[01:44:20.360 --> 01:44:26.200]   uh they're they're not going to be excuses for ram limitations or anything else like that
[01:44:26.200 --> 01:44:30.200]   this is going to be the year that we're going to see at least one machine that shows you here is
[01:44:30.200 --> 01:44:35.960]   what we can do when we want to maximize on the on the variable of power and that's going to be
[01:44:35.960 --> 01:44:42.440]   something interesting i think the iMac and the the iMac and the mac mini are two very very good
[01:44:42.440 --> 01:44:47.160]   targets for that sort of thing because they can set very very good goals and particularly with the
[01:44:47.160 --> 01:44:51.160]   iMac pro where they can see here's how here's how much the they can say here's how much the apple
[01:44:51.160 --> 01:44:57.240]   silicon based iMac pro kicks the butt performance wise on the old one and we don't have it doesn't
[01:44:57.240 --> 01:45:01.640]   make as much noise as a quadrocopter when you're trying to actually render video
[01:45:01.640 --> 01:45:06.280]   when you remember those huge huge huge fans that they needed to put in there just to cool it down
[01:45:06.280 --> 01:45:12.280]   and make sure it's working so and the mac mini is it really is i think the sleeper machine like
[01:45:12.280 --> 01:45:16.840]   kind of like alexa alluded to that it is when you when you don't want to spend money on a screen
[01:45:16.840 --> 01:45:21.640]   you don't need you don't you just want something you can as as much connectivity as possible as you
[01:45:21.640 --> 01:45:25.720]   don't want to have as many harmonica's and bridges connected to it just so you can connect all your
[01:45:25.720 --> 01:45:30.600]   usb's and all of your high speed networking and all your high speed storage that's going to be a
[01:45:30.600 --> 01:45:35.880]   really really good show-off piece so wwdc is going to be a very very interesting place to show off
[01:45:35.880 --> 01:45:41.000]   all the developers now we want to we were selling you last year the devices that you bought just to
[01:45:41.000 --> 01:45:44.920]   make sure that your code would run properly here is the stuff that we're going to sell you because
[01:45:44.920 --> 01:45:50.680]   you want to start to run xcode and compile compile packages like 10 times faster than you could
[01:45:50.680 --> 01:45:55.320]   before yeah i think i i want to replace my i'm x basically with mac minis it just seems like the
[01:45:55.320 --> 01:46:00.760]   the logical thing to do i'm i haven't bought the new laptop i've obviously a bunch of mac of the
[01:46:00.760 --> 01:46:04.680]   new mac minis and just i just love them i mean they just come up oh and once they stay boy they
[01:46:04.680 --> 01:46:10.280]   i mean there's some i want the 16 inch so badly the 16 inch macbook pro backbook pro
[01:46:10.280 --> 01:46:18.360]   uh also wwdc machine i think the m1x stuff will like they could do an event like the only thing
[01:46:18.360 --> 01:46:23.160]   if they're just putting out like new chips in the existing chassis they've already done that
[01:46:23.160 --> 01:46:27.240]   they've explained they've shown us how that works so they don't be pressure-laces yeah but if
[01:46:27.240 --> 01:46:31.160]   it's the new designs if like the new design for the iMac is ready i think anything as a new design
[01:46:31.160 --> 01:46:37.640]   gets an event and typically they've done iMacs and macbook pros and things in wwdc so if they
[01:46:37.640 --> 01:46:42.040]   don't have like a may event or an april event that is just specific to the mac and they might because
[01:46:42.040 --> 01:46:45.800]   it's the new season of apple shows they can do anything they want now maybe there'll be a special
[01:46:45.800 --> 01:46:50.440]   april mac event and they do all this that's what i wonder i really think this could be the year
[01:46:50.440 --> 01:46:56.280]   the year of mac events i mean we had three last fall i would be surprised to see one every other
[01:46:56.280 --> 01:47:01.160]   month or something like that i mean there's going to be a lot because it does work better we don't
[01:47:01.160 --> 01:47:07.800]   need to have these in-person events they're fantastic yeah i mean i think then go ahead
[01:47:07.800 --> 01:47:12.440]   just imagine one one device having the entire new cycle for that week as opposed to right pick
[01:47:12.440 --> 01:47:16.040]   you pick pick your winner do you want to talk about the new service do you want to talk about
[01:47:16.040 --> 01:47:19.400]   the new device do you want to talk about the new desktop it makes me happy wouldn't have to do
[01:47:19.400 --> 01:47:25.160]   so many rumors shows yeah spread it out i mean really good as soon as that 16-inch comes out i'm
[01:47:25.160 --> 01:47:31.000]   maxing it out yep go ahead and i and i think that you know the the last apple's getting better at those
[01:47:31.000 --> 01:47:38.360]   at the keynotes and so there those are those are getting better i think that yeah frame i
[01:47:38.360 --> 01:47:43.240]   oh kind of set the high high watermark i'm sure that no one's missed that what's frame i as far as
[01:47:43.240 --> 01:47:48.120]   what was that for well frame i oh released uh you know they released their new camera to cloud
[01:47:48.120 --> 01:47:52.440]   um technology which i think i talked about in a previous one but it really let the the thing
[01:47:52.440 --> 01:47:57.880]   for filmmakers it's amazing it means that you can be at a set and while you're shooting it's putting
[01:47:57.880 --> 01:48:03.880]   those it literally when you stop the camera it uploads the file so that an editor can be starting
[01:48:03.880 --> 01:48:09.000]   to cut with it as you're working like as you're in the field it's sending all that stuff back to
[01:48:09.000 --> 01:48:14.040]   like literally dropping it into resolve or final code so camera basically camera to cloud yeah but
[01:48:14.040 --> 01:48:20.200]   but what makes what was from a keynote perspective the rollout of that which you know was starring
[01:48:20.200 --> 01:48:26.280]   emory wells our friend oh yeah kidding um yeah it's emory's company right right and um and so uh
[01:48:26.280 --> 01:48:32.200]   so anyway that rollout that keynote rollout it's probably the best keynote ever made i'm gonna
[01:48:32.200 --> 01:48:37.880]   watch it because they they stopped being i mean it's they stopped trying to figure out how to
[01:48:37.880 --> 01:48:42.280]   reproduce anything that even looks like a stage they just were like we're gonna make a movie about
[01:48:42.280 --> 01:48:48.280]   our problem yeah why not and that's like and that's and when apple when apple turns that corner they
[01:48:48.280 --> 01:48:54.120]   haven't turned by the way they also did it in 35 minutes right and and again you can you can start
[01:48:54.120 --> 01:48:59.000]   you can and they and they packed when you watch it they packed an enormous amount of information
[01:48:59.560 --> 01:49:04.520]   into into 35 minutes and and the thing is and you see the design is really good because emory is a
[01:49:04.520 --> 01:49:09.720]   post-production person you know so um but when you well you're also talking to that audience so you
[01:49:09.720 --> 01:49:15.400]   better look good right you you're talking to a very knowledgeable audience well they and they
[01:49:15.400 --> 01:49:20.600]   have incredible you know they uh you know so but you but they just you know again they stop thinking
[01:49:20.600 --> 01:49:27.320]   about this as a live event you know an on stage just it's a movie it's yeah there's yeah in the
[01:49:27.320 --> 01:49:33.480]   parallel back there's you know and um the back ladder that's cool yeah but every every it was a little
[01:49:33.480 --> 01:49:39.320]   bit of a presenter thing well he's talking about it it's it's more of a i say more of a
[01:49:39.320 --> 01:49:43.160]   almost a james berg or tv show kind of thing where i'm going to walk through something and talk
[01:49:43.160 --> 01:49:52.200]   about it yeah so so it's it is a um but the the main thing is is that when you look at this keynote
[01:49:52.200 --> 01:49:58.440]   what you're looking at is we're no longer it's just a tv show about the product right and if you skip
[01:49:58.440 --> 01:50:06.040]   forward you'll see more and more of that um apple still is like the the best um the best stage show
[01:50:06.040 --> 01:50:10.520]   ever right like they're doing that really really well but they're still tied to that old old thing
[01:50:10.520 --> 01:50:15.240]   maybe because they're they're thinking we're gonna come back to it well i i think that that
[01:50:15.240 --> 01:50:19.400]   again i think that i would as a press person i would rather just go into the theater and watch
[01:50:19.400 --> 01:50:23.080]   a watch a movie and then come out and play with the products you know like it's you know i don't need
[01:50:23.080 --> 01:50:26.840]   i don't need to see them on stage it doesn't mean anything to me right you agree rene
[01:50:26.840 --> 01:50:32.440]   yeah absolutely i would like we went in there i mean like you'll lose a little bit of the energy
[01:50:32.440 --> 01:50:36.360]   that kreg federicki gets from making his dad jokes when we all grown at them right back at him you
[01:50:36.360 --> 01:50:40.600]   know that you get that fees their performances a little bit but if there was hybrid where like a
[01:50:40.600 --> 01:50:44.760]   couple guys come out like tim cook comes out or cayenne drance comes out and says this is what we
[01:50:44.760 --> 01:50:49.160]   have for you and then they break it up into a few separate video acts and everyone at home
[01:50:49.160 --> 01:50:52.760]   gets a much better presentation because they're not just watching a button it's like the difference
[01:50:52.760 --> 01:50:57.480]   between filming a stage play and making a movie exactly to alex's point and then as long as we have
[01:50:57.480 --> 01:51:01.800]   the hands-on area afterwards we can do everything we need we can talk to them okay be great
[01:51:01.800 --> 01:51:06.680]   mostly i think it's important that they just get their story straight that we're gonna figure
[01:51:06.680 --> 01:51:11.160]   out with this device or with this product or servers can do whether it's suitable for purpose
[01:51:11.160 --> 01:51:16.440]   but it's a good value and all that kind of stuff on our own but it's yet i think that
[01:51:16.440 --> 01:51:21.880]   that's the opportunity for these companies to say here is what we intend this to be for this is the
[01:51:21.880 --> 01:51:27.400]   kind of user that we've designed this for so that we're not saying oh well geez i mean if this
[01:51:27.400 --> 01:51:32.120]   can't if this camera doesn't support 240 frames per second at 8k i mean who are you trying to kid
[01:51:32.120 --> 01:51:35.880]   well we're not trying to make it for professional filmmakers it's just for it's just for consumers
[01:51:35.880 --> 01:51:39.640]   we're trying to get that's that's the sort of that's what they have to focus on if they're trying to
[01:51:39.640 --> 01:51:44.840]   impress us with lots of hold for applause moments that's that's the point which like i find myself
[01:51:44.840 --> 01:51:50.120]   checking my email turn the chiller the kakurza and i like to leave us alone and i think that just
[01:51:50.120 --> 01:51:53.960]   that you know the what brings up the production value of a lot of these stage shows are all the
[01:51:53.960 --> 01:51:58.440]   the movies that they play out that show you what that product can do and why not just get rid of
[01:51:58.440 --> 01:52:02.680]   all the stage stuff you know just just just just just do just do the impressive part that that sets
[01:52:02.680 --> 01:52:07.800]   the context of what they want to say and and just tighten that all up and and enough of the you know
[01:52:07.800 --> 01:52:11.400]   the presentation stuff and just explain it and make it a great movie and i think that apple's
[01:52:11.400 --> 01:52:17.960]   going that direction i think face uh frame i owe pass them you know and i think that uh i think if
[01:52:17.960 --> 01:52:23.400]   apple apple takes the weight that it has and put and the budget that it has to do this and and
[01:52:23.400 --> 01:52:29.960]   it could easily turn this into a feature film quality you know uh presentation that is not slowed
[01:52:29.960 --> 01:52:34.840]   down by how fast you can talk about something you know that's the problem with all stage stuff is
[01:52:34.840 --> 01:52:40.520]   that it's just very inefficient i think apple is uh probably looking at this i mean really it's a
[01:52:40.520 --> 01:52:46.520]   problem of uh pr and communications and marketing not a problem of technology and that i think what
[01:52:46.520 --> 01:52:51.480]   you're going to see is you're going to see different styles evolve over time right now apple's still
[01:52:51.480 --> 01:52:56.520]   stuck in that notion of well we had steve jobs come out in the stage because he was steve jobs uh i
[01:52:56.520 --> 01:53:00.280]   think you're right well we also didn't have the quality we we didn't have what we have now you
[01:53:00.280 --> 01:53:04.760]   couldn't have done it you know like the thing is is that the the the ability to do this at this level
[01:53:04.760 --> 01:53:08.840]   hasn't really an ability you could have always made a movie out of it you could have always you
[01:53:08.840 --> 01:53:13.400]   could have always but there was no tv show i mean there's no reason they had to do a stage presentation
[01:53:13.400 --> 01:53:20.600]   right but i think that well i think they did it because they had the best keynote guy of all time
[01:53:20.600 --> 01:53:26.840]   and so they did it because people came to see steve jobs and and see him in person so they're
[01:53:26.840 --> 01:53:30.520]   it made other companies did it too and they did well that's right i think that it's really a
[01:53:30.520 --> 01:53:35.640]   pr marketing uh problem and you know what's going to happen is styles are going to change
[01:53:35.640 --> 01:53:40.440]   contents going to change apple is probably time to start thinking you know steve's not with us anymore
[01:53:40.440 --> 01:53:44.440]   we don't have to do a steve jobs keynote anymore i think a lot of companies that were finding that
[01:53:44.440 --> 01:53:48.040]   hey the movie the movies look a lot better than anything we were doing on stage and so that's
[01:53:48.040 --> 01:53:51.400]   starting to break that up yeah but i disagree with you Alex i mean i haven't you have a different
[01:53:51.400 --> 01:53:56.600]   philosophy than me but i do think that there i still go to plays there are reasons for a live
[01:53:56.600 --> 01:54:01.080]   presentation and i wouldn't you gotta remember this is not about getting the most amount of
[01:54:01.080 --> 01:54:06.280]   content out as fast as possible for an expert in the field this is pr in marketing this is aimed at
[01:54:06.280 --> 01:54:10.440]   the the general press with the incense like in person that would make a lot of sense this is
[01:54:10.440 --> 01:54:15.640]   aimed at the general press this is uh aimed at normal users uh so they have to really think about
[01:54:15.640 --> 01:54:19.480]   who are we aiming this at and what do they want if they're going to make everything for Alex Lindsay
[01:54:19.480 --> 01:54:23.000]   i agree they should make it differently well no but i but i think that i but i think that the thing
[01:54:23.000 --> 01:54:27.560]   is is that is that i still want that face face to face time that you get in one of those things
[01:54:27.560 --> 01:54:30.600]   where i get to talk to an expert and i get to have all that stuff that's the stuff that's important
[01:54:30.600 --> 01:54:36.360]   to me like you have different needs i'm sitting then the reporter from bloomburg who has it as a
[01:54:36.360 --> 01:54:41.720]   different agenda i i just think that the that you got to trust that the companies pr marketing
[01:54:41.720 --> 01:54:45.480]   people are good enough to understand the the audience and to make something that fits the
[01:54:45.480 --> 01:54:49.880]   audience's needs yeah i agree with you it's time to move on but but it doesn't necessarily time to
[01:54:49.880 --> 01:54:55.560]   do everybody to do a tv show also also another another part of the problem is that over the years
[01:54:55.560 --> 01:55:01.080]   a lot of companies apple included have been doing a have been restricting access to
[01:55:01.080 --> 01:55:07.080]   the people that you want to talk to much much more tightly it used to be that there were there
[01:55:07.080 --> 01:55:10.520]   there would be certain engineers there would be certain people that you know of just sort of
[01:55:10.520 --> 01:55:15.400]   milling about that you can sort of walk up to and ask yeah you know get that out of it yeah and now
[01:55:15.400 --> 01:55:19.400]   it's at there was a i don't know what what when the signal change was but now it's like
[01:55:19.400 --> 01:55:23.880]   either you're alone in a room in a very very controlled environment with one hand selected
[01:55:23.880 --> 01:55:28.120]   person who's been doing this for two days or you're going to be talk to people who are very very
[01:55:28.120 --> 01:55:32.520]   knowledgeable who can definitely walk you through it but if you ask them something that is maybe
[01:55:32.520 --> 01:55:36.360]   off the boards you're definitely going to get it oh well we'll get back to you and then and that
[01:55:36.360 --> 01:55:41.000]   might be you know honestly that might be a flaw in apple's culture that may uh not be the best
[01:55:41.000 --> 01:55:45.240]   way to deal with the press but it's the way apple does because they're well you see a ton of what
[01:55:45.240 --> 01:55:50.440]   a microsoft executives in clubhouse like just like just and google executives in clubhouse on stage
[01:55:50.440 --> 01:55:55.320]   talking about the stuff and you never see that from apple right so it's it's a cultural thing and
[01:55:55.320 --> 01:56:00.120]   who knows if it's the right thing for them to do it might not be and i also think that that again
[01:56:00.120 --> 01:56:03.960]   again resolution and so on so forth makes a big difference i mean when we started doing these
[01:56:03.960 --> 01:56:07.400]   with these keynotes the best we could do a standard deaf television like so you would never
[01:56:07.400 --> 01:56:13.400]   want to release something like that now the ability just to do 60 frame 4k is enough to be an entirely
[01:56:13.400 --> 01:56:18.760]   different experience for someone watching than than if we were putting out you know 640 by 480
[01:56:18.760 --> 01:56:23.560]   you know so that that'll be the problem too yep and also put a 3d model of the thing that you're
[01:56:23.560 --> 01:56:28.920]   trying to you're trying to seduce soner to buying like here it is on your desk doesn't that look nice
[01:56:28.920 --> 01:56:34.200]   yeah you can make that real for only $1,800 right a couple other stories before we get to the
[01:56:34.200 --> 01:56:40.120]   picks of the week apple tv is announced they're going to do a programming partnership with malala
[01:56:40.120 --> 01:56:46.520]   uh what that's interesting apple you know it's funny because probably
[01:56:46.520 --> 01:56:53.000]   this isn't the kind of thing you do if you say i want big ratings so that's kind of nice that
[01:56:53.000 --> 01:56:57.640]   apple doesn't have to say well we're we're in it for the ratings maybe we're in it for the good
[01:56:57.640 --> 01:57:03.240]   we can do so we don't give a damn about the ROI wasn't that the famous Tim Cook statement yeah
[01:57:03.240 --> 01:57:09.720]   yeah malala has a production company called extracurricular and they're going to
[01:57:09.720 --> 01:57:14.840]   i believe in the power of stories to bring families together forage friendships build
[01:57:14.840 --> 01:57:20.280]   movements and inspire children to dream i couldn't ask for a better partner malala says than apple
[01:57:20.280 --> 01:57:26.120]   to help bring these stories to life so it you know it'll be interesting it's you know it's going to be
[01:57:26.120 --> 01:57:32.040]   good PR it may not be good to you in a long relationship with her though like Tim Cook has
[01:57:32.040 --> 01:57:36.200]   and and she's been meeting and she and English is such a tard language for me
[01:57:36.200 --> 01:57:39.640]   have been meeting for years and they've been talking about those meetings for years and they've been
[01:57:39.640 --> 01:57:45.160]   supporting her fund for years and i think this is just the next logical step for them in servicing
[01:57:45.160 --> 01:57:50.200]   their greater agenda but i have to say a lot of the apple originals are more about that than they
[01:57:50.200 --> 01:57:55.240]   are about uh what's going to be you know what's going to be the next mandalorian uh they have
[01:57:55.240 --> 01:57:59.240]   foundation i have to reveal i'm so nervous foundation might be i know i'm so nervous i got
[01:57:59.240 --> 01:58:04.280]   foundation yeah i found that they're they're uh the small world was something that i was excited
[01:58:04.280 --> 01:58:09.800]   about i haven't actually watched you know i've watched and i don't like it because uh and it's
[01:58:09.800 --> 01:58:17.400]   your fault Alex because i realize now how much of it's staged and fake and it's all your fault but
[01:58:17.400 --> 01:58:23.480]   it's even worse than the normal nature documentary i mean it's really very obvious that they're
[01:58:23.480 --> 01:58:27.560]   cobbling this together and that kind of bugged me i don't think it's a very good nature documentary
[01:58:27.560 --> 01:58:33.800]   in my opinion which one small world tiny world i enjoyed it i know it was fun lee lisa enjoys it too
[01:58:33.800 --> 01:58:38.440]   so that's why i'm watching it but um you like i said you said oh you know fake all that stuff
[01:58:38.440 --> 01:58:43.240]   and once i knew that i was like the seams were very very that's been since the that's been since
[01:58:43.240 --> 01:58:48.920]   the the dawn i know but if you watch bbc's planet earth it's not immediately apparent that this
[01:58:48.920 --> 01:58:53.320]   sucks that there's because it's because it's not as high quality either i mean part of it is just
[01:58:53.320 --> 01:58:59.800]   these insane shots that are just unbelievable uh are um you know are are part of that and i think
[01:58:59.800 --> 01:59:04.280]   that that's the part that is just so interesting about it um they're just really hard shots like
[01:59:04.280 --> 01:59:09.800]   they're uh yeah so you like it for production reasons but now i think i think i think i see
[01:59:09.800 --> 01:59:13.560]   this too i think it's i think it's interesting you learn a lot i think that there's a lot of really
[01:59:13.560 --> 01:59:20.920]   interesting you really learn a lot okay in episode one that damn dung beetle uh spoilers totally fake
[01:59:21.560 --> 01:59:27.400]   totally faked you know i don't he pushes it into the lake but it's not a lake it's the hoof
[01:59:27.400 --> 01:59:32.360]   print of a giant elephant look he's so tiny and then right man i'm just like oh please give me
[01:59:32.360 --> 01:59:38.200]   bob orchard's house is right next to the tiny dung beetles it's all cgi i like nature documentaries
[01:59:38.200 --> 01:59:43.640]   i guess but uh it's no plan like that though i mean they're they're all manufactured like they're
[01:59:43.640 --> 01:59:48.600]   only you spoiled it for me thanks right yeah yeah yeah so so he's what stops to enjoy an ice
[01:59:48.600 --> 01:59:55.560]   also star trek not film one location leo i'm star trek not film one location okay sorry we have a
[01:59:55.560 --> 02:00:01.640]   star trek you know that's a you know the ice cream cone guy is really you know a piece of canvas over
[02:00:01.640 --> 02:00:06.600]   why universal translator translates everything but cling on i understand the world that you know that
[02:00:06.600 --> 02:00:15.160]   you you accept that uh anyway uh just wanted lasso too i i i want to break it to you leo that a
[02:00:15.160 --> 02:00:18.360]   lot of those reality tv shows there's not really any reality no i know that
[02:00:18.360 --> 02:00:24.280]   just one i know i know that i'm watching below dick i know it's all in the editing i know i
[02:00:24.280 --> 02:00:28.120]   not even just in the editing it's all manufactured yeah the whole thing the whole thing is manufactured
[02:00:28.120 --> 02:00:31.960]   you could tell when someone turns around and they yell the b-word it's they're doing that in
[02:00:31.960 --> 02:00:36.200]   post they're totally making up that drama to get ready actually you know i found that out with below
[02:00:36.200 --> 02:00:46.360]   deck which is um my secret uh an embarrassing pleasure uh it's about uh super yachts and the
[02:00:46.360 --> 02:00:51.880]   crews that are below deck and the horrible usually guests that are above deck and there's a lot of
[02:00:51.880 --> 02:00:56.520]   drama and stuff and i found that later that they loop a lot of that dialogue that six months after
[02:00:56.520 --> 02:01:01.560]   they shoot the whole thing they bring the cast in into a studio to loop dialogue it's like well
[02:01:01.560 --> 02:01:07.640]   that's really bad that's totally just build a tea to make the drama yeah all right yeah everything
[02:01:07.640 --> 02:01:12.760]   it's fake turtles all the way down yeah i don't care i i absolutely believe that tara did not come
[02:01:12.760 --> 02:01:19.240]   here to make friends you can just see that they can feel you can't fake that you were mentioning
[02:01:19.240 --> 02:01:27.160]   title square has purchased jazzy's title 297 million dollars i purchased i think just controlled uh
[02:01:27.160 --> 02:01:33.080]   controlling interest i think yes you're right majority um jazzy will join squares board
[02:01:33.080 --> 02:01:39.160]   jack jorsey will now have twitter square and title to run it's amazing this guy how does he do it all
[02:01:39.160 --> 02:01:45.320]   uh i think i think the interesting thing there will be that that he just sold his first tweet on nft
[02:01:45.320 --> 02:01:50.360]   and i think that's that's the tie-in to title like you know is all those artists that have all
[02:01:50.360 --> 02:01:54.920]   this perceived value no you've not you're not wrong there that that's that's one of the things
[02:01:54.920 --> 02:01:59.400]   they're thinking about because square obviously a financial transaction company why would they buy
[02:01:59.400 --> 02:02:08.680]   a music streaming music service huge pent up um opportunity for if if you understood nft and you
[02:02:08.680 --> 02:02:13.400]   got ahold of all those artists who that can sign things and sell them on nft i mean grimes what
[02:02:13.400 --> 02:02:17.480]   what did she make like five five point eight million or eight point five hundred minutes oh my god
[02:02:17.480 --> 02:02:22.120]   in like twenty minutes and so so the thing is is that is that getting access to those artists and
[02:02:22.680 --> 02:02:27.400]   you know make in time the music experience into the nft's is probably a pretty interesting business
[02:02:27.400 --> 02:02:33.800]   model which i wouldn't think of except for the fact that he immediately around the sale sold his first
[02:02:33.800 --> 02:02:39.560]   tweet um hasn't sold it yet yeah it's not too late you have till march 21st to get in on the action
[02:02:39.560 --> 02:02:44.040]   are they pronounced nifties or knife-teas is it like gift i'm gonna get yelled at and
[02:02:44.040 --> 02:02:49.560]   nft i think well i see yeah they say and they're rhymed with grift nift drums
[02:02:49.560 --> 02:02:52.360]   nift drums nift drums nift drums nift drums nift drums nift drums nift drums nift
[02:02:52.360 --> 02:03:00.440]   exactly that's exactly right andy yep he's selling his first tweet until until until this is a
[02:03:00.440 --> 02:03:04.360]   marketplace of people who actually want the things that are buying as opposed to people who are
[02:03:04.360 --> 02:03:09.800]   speculating the you're where we're we're back in the days of hogs beanie babies yeah it's speculates
[02:03:09.800 --> 02:03:14.360]   although we're a tray rack was going to be uh on twig tomorrow so just a little plug
[02:03:14.360 --> 02:03:19.480]   for this week in google tomorrow afternoon uh trays got starting to do nft's for his art and i
[02:03:19.480 --> 02:03:23.560]   thought well let's get somebody who's selling this stuff to explain it trays always been on the
[02:03:23.560 --> 02:03:28.680]   cutting edge of all of this stuff uh he okay it has a little bit to do with the fact he gave me
[02:03:28.680 --> 02:03:35.480]   one of his nft's so i'm rich no i don't know what i do with it i said i promise to my won't sell it's
[02:03:35.480 --> 02:03:40.920]   like the internet like the digital goods provided infinite abundance and zero marginal cost for
[02:03:40.920 --> 02:03:45.640]   replication and now we figured out a way to artificially create both scarcity and value
[02:03:45.640 --> 02:03:51.320]   for these things at the at the expense of massive compute and electrical power expensive the
[02:03:51.320 --> 02:03:57.000]   environment yeah well you know we're gonna have global global warming but at least we'll have nft's
[02:03:57.000 --> 02:04:01.880]   can we use the global warming the way the thing you use like the the temperate springs in scandinavia
[02:04:01.880 --> 02:04:07.560]   can we just power everything there are lots of people now who use uh crypto miners to heat the house
[02:04:07.560 --> 02:04:14.200]   i just there's a great reddit thread on a guy because he has a heat pump so a heat pump takes the
[02:04:14.200 --> 02:04:19.080]   air and you know recirculates it and he figured out if he could put the crypto miner in between
[02:04:19.080 --> 02:04:23.880]   it would heat the air because there's a big deal with a heat pump with it's really cold outside
[02:04:23.880 --> 02:04:29.880]   as people in texas learn it doesn't do a very good job because it's such a gradient between the
[02:04:29.880 --> 02:04:34.840]   temperature outside and temperature inside but if you put a bitcoin miner into the tube
[02:04:34.840 --> 02:04:40.520]   profit yep i went to it when i was a border because right now our heat pump doesn't really help
[02:04:40.520 --> 02:04:44.040]   you guys in winter because there's not enough canadian air to get rid of all your your sounds
[02:04:44.040 --> 02:04:50.200]   you guys are way too cold up there i know speaking of the when i was at rp i our computing center
[02:04:50.200 --> 02:04:54.440]   our computing center was heated by the computer in the basement literally yeah and we're talking
[02:04:54.440 --> 02:05:00.280]   we're talking about rp i upstate new york so that's that's saying something visual studio code which
[02:05:00.280 --> 02:05:07.320]   has been available in beta for apple silicon is now officially the first stable release of uh
[02:05:07.320 --> 02:05:15.880]   probably one of the most popular uh code editors vs code uh it's joining a long list of apps that
[02:05:15.880 --> 02:05:21.880]   are finally starting to see m1 really be well widely supported i see universal binaries for a
[02:05:21.880 --> 02:05:27.480]   lot of apps now i only have a maybe three or four on my macbook pro that are still running
[02:05:27.480 --> 02:05:32.440]   intel under rosetta too so i think that's good news if you're an m1 fan or if you're an apple
[02:05:32.440 --> 02:05:38.920]   silicon fan yeah people are there's no question that developers are jumping in not just the apple
[02:05:38.920 --> 02:05:44.120]   you know the apple guys like james tomsen but but uh big companies like microsoft are jumping on
[02:05:44.120 --> 02:05:48.120]   the bandwagon so that's really well there was that huge 3d you know um what was it octane
[02:05:48.840 --> 02:05:54.360]   octane tanner octane x octane x yeah you have to explain that to me what is octane x that's got to
[02:05:54.360 --> 02:05:57.720]   be an alex thing because they're talking about minting nft's with it too and i'm so confused
[02:05:57.720 --> 02:06:06.840]   it's so it's fast spectral gpu rendering yeah it so octane is a very very high end uh oh toy
[02:06:06.840 --> 02:06:10.840]   makes octane they've been around for a long time and it's a very high end renderer so it does
[02:06:10.840 --> 02:06:18.440]   really high end um powerful uh rendering and um it has not been i mean it's now moved to the app store
[02:06:18.440 --> 02:06:23.560]   and i think that you get a free year license um of it to use it which is i don't remember what the
[02:06:23.560 --> 02:06:28.440]   cost is but it's expensive so um it's i was actually going to make it like a second pick
[02:06:28.440 --> 02:06:33.400]   this week because it's just it's really exciting um you get a free one-year subscription to octane
[02:06:33.400 --> 02:06:41.400]   uh x prime and enterprise yeah normally normally 40 euros a month so right yeah so it's it's worth
[02:06:41.400 --> 02:06:46.840]   uh if you're doing 3d uh it's definitely worth um doing so you can you know most of the 3d app
[02:06:46.840 --> 02:06:50.280]   applications will render out to it so you can say this is with the renderer that i'm using
[02:06:50.280 --> 02:06:56.280]   um you know to to send that out and so i think that it's uh it's pretty slick yeah so uh we don't
[02:06:56.280 --> 02:07:01.640]   have better gpu's to take advantage of it well it'll be interesting to see what the m1 does
[02:07:01.640 --> 02:07:07.720]   you know or and of course a mac pro can can probably uh run it pretty well so um but this
[02:07:07.720 --> 02:07:13.400]   this is the line uh octane x for mac brings all the octane and enterprise standalone features
[02:07:13.400 --> 02:07:20.280]   to mac users playing octane x dcc plugins enterprise features and the uh render network support
[02:07:20.280 --> 02:07:23.880]   the industry's first decentralized gpu rendering platform enabling
[02:07:23.880 --> 02:07:30.600]   that uh forward thinking mac artist to publish their nft crypto art on the ethereum blockchain
[02:07:30.600 --> 02:07:37.480]   thank you very much and one of the things that just happened i i i i didn't follow exactly who it
[02:07:37.480 --> 02:07:41.160]   was but there was a there was an artist that just sold he i mean he spent a lot of time on it this
[02:07:41.160 --> 02:07:47.080]   this michael jackson uh head you know busts or digital digital rendering of michael jackson sold
[02:07:47.080 --> 02:07:52.760]   it for a hundred and twenty thousand dollars on um you know as an nft and so you know the i think
[02:07:52.760 --> 02:07:57.720]   that there is actually a pretty big market for 3d artists to create something that's original
[02:07:57.720 --> 02:08:03.320]   and putting it out nft it's not i mean the nft i need to say that i i i'm trying to get my head
[02:08:03.320 --> 02:08:07.480]   around it because you know i i'm not a collector i don't collect anything so i mean i keep some of
[02:08:07.480 --> 02:08:12.600]   my old gear that i think is cool but that's about it you know and and um so i don't really understand
[02:08:12.600 --> 02:08:17.400]   the speculative nature of this process but but i can see people how they're taking advantage of it
[02:08:17.400 --> 02:08:22.520]   noctane will be one of the renders that i think is is used uh to produce some of the high quality
[02:08:22.520 --> 02:08:28.760]   you know high quality stuff you're talking about beeple who is actually the most unassuming
[02:08:28.760 --> 02:08:38.520]   kind of normal guy who is selling millions of dollars of nft's on uh it's amazing really nft
[02:08:38.520 --> 02:08:48.760]   artwork mike winkleman um we're setting records actually on his nft's uh uh there's a whole bunch
[02:08:48.760 --> 02:08:53.960]   of things filled about nft's and copyright to and trademark and pat like all the different ways
[02:08:53.960 --> 02:08:57.240]   that if you have ownership of it all right like what does what does that mean in terms of the
[02:08:57.240 --> 02:09:05.160]   copyright on it it's going to be uh crazy pants for a while crazy pants yeah my favorite kind of pants
[02:09:05.160 --> 02:09:13.960]   oh i mean who isn't i cloud user locked out for six months over coating bug related to her last
[02:09:13.960 --> 02:09:22.200]   name rachel's last name is true it happened before with null right and now this is the second time
[02:09:22.200 --> 02:09:28.760]   something like this has happened cannot set value true to property last name of course not because
[02:09:28.760 --> 02:09:37.880]   true is a boolean not a string anyone else getting this error from apple i cloud no only rachel true
[02:09:37.880 --> 02:09:45.640]   yeah she forgot to capitalize the last the first letter last name and she's been locked out for
[02:09:45.640 --> 02:09:52.680]   six months and now she's and now she's and the actually the center part of the side of the part
[02:09:52.680 --> 02:09:58.840]   of the story is that this has been going on for six months and now she's just just just like a lot
[02:09:58.840 --> 02:10:03.720]   of other people in customer service problems so long if we can turn this into a buzzworthy article
[02:10:03.720 --> 02:10:08.200]   maybe we can finally shame this company in recognizing that you've kind of destroyed part of my life
[02:10:08.200 --> 02:10:15.880]   here uh that's what we've learned and little johnny drop tables still johnny tables jolly tables
[02:10:15.880 --> 02:10:18.040]   he ran the table
[02:10:18.040 --> 02:10:26.920]   let's see i'm just looking for all the little uh wonderful shorties that mica
[02:10:26.920 --> 02:10:32.600]   sergeant has put together for us today apple faces a french complaint
[02:10:33.080 --> 02:10:34.280]   oh sakre bleu over the suit
[02:10:34.280 --> 02:10:44.600]   over the iphone advertising tool france advertising he's it's all a lobby group representing startups
[02:10:44.600 --> 02:10:49.240]   and venture capital firms filed a complaint on tuesday saying that apples tuesday being today
[02:10:49.240 --> 02:10:54.280]   that apples own advertising system does not its own system does not seek his users consent
[02:10:54.280 --> 02:10:59.240]   receiving targeted ads but they do require that of every third party i thought apple fixed that
[02:10:59.240 --> 02:11:04.120]   that was a complaint from face well it's complete nonsense it's like the apples thing is first party
[02:11:04.120 --> 02:11:08.040]   and nobody intercedes on first party facebook can serve you all the as they want on facebook
[02:11:08.040 --> 02:11:12.200]   google can serve you all the as they want on google search and youtube and gmail and android
[02:11:12.200 --> 02:11:17.720]   i mean if they really wanted to this that's all apple does is show you recommended apps in the app
[02:11:17.720 --> 02:11:24.200]   store which is like the lamest of of advertising possible uh that i can think of and completely
[02:11:24.200 --> 02:11:28.360]   different than third party so it's just i think it's a sign that face books sort of bs
[02:11:28.360 --> 02:11:35.720]   conflation propaganda is permeating working yeah yeah um all right so we'll see uh we'll see what
[02:11:35.720 --> 02:11:41.400]   the uh outcome of that is apple says we haven't noticed it's so bad we even notice if we stop
[02:11:41.400 --> 02:11:47.080]   doing it right yeah right you kind of skip over it you're just like oh my gosh just scroll past that
[02:11:47.080 --> 02:11:53.560]   app store payment scrutiny mounts in the uk as well apples get investigated everywhere as as
[02:11:53.560 --> 02:11:58.200]   is all big just came out in support of them um they were uh i forget the gentleman's name but he
[02:11:58.200 --> 02:12:03.160]   was on nealy patel's podcast and nealy was complaining about the new super uh the super
[02:12:03.160 --> 02:12:08.520]   follows on twitter and that he might have to give 30 to apple and twitter said they really they really
[02:12:08.520 --> 02:12:13.800]   liked the fact that android and apple provides trusted robust uh architect is for all this because
[02:12:13.800 --> 02:12:18.600]   it is really difficult not only to engineer them yourself but to gain the trust of a you of a very
[02:12:18.600 --> 02:12:24.120]   large user base yourself and that they saw it as an opportunity for creators to earn 70 percent
[02:12:24.120 --> 02:12:28.760]   not not to lose 30 percent to apple which i think is very similar to the feeling we have on youtube
[02:12:28.760 --> 02:12:33.160]   where they take i forget 45 percent or something it's 45 percent or something but no one would have to
[02:12:33.160 --> 02:12:37.720]   sell any ads at all ever in your whole life they do it all well i mean i have access to youtube's
[02:12:37.720 --> 02:12:41.880]   huge user base which would be non trivial for me to reproduce as a solo video creator right yeah
[02:12:43.880 --> 02:12:51.000]   uh okay um oh it's to be to be fair you have the option going to twitch you have the option to
[02:12:51.000 --> 02:12:55.880]   go into fimio you have option going elsewhere that's the the the problem is that you're kind of
[02:12:55.880 --> 02:13:01.800]   locked into one uh one payment processor in one store oh twitter i think you like they're gonna
[02:13:01.800 --> 02:13:06.280]   do it on the web they don't think it's going to be all as popular as it is on mobile it's just so
[02:13:06.280 --> 02:13:11.560]   nice and i have to say in some ways i hate apple pay because it's too damn easy to spend money in
[02:13:11.560 --> 02:13:14.760]   the middle of the night on something you don't really want but you're a little sleepy and you buy it
[02:13:14.760 --> 02:13:22.840]   anyway oh yeah what have you done it just looks at me and says okay you paid for it that's good
[02:13:22.840 --> 02:13:28.200]   is that like that you asked you on tv yeah as as seen on instagram with apple pay oh god just look
[02:13:28.200 --> 02:13:35.320]   at me and you you own it okay i i uh i find that i my my shopping habits have really i knew that it
[02:13:35.320 --> 02:13:39.160]   would happen over time but now it's like i i look at gas stations and i go they don't support apple
[02:13:39.160 --> 02:13:43.400]   pal you're right you know like i and i and i go you know i don't want to i don't want to actually
[02:13:43.400 --> 02:13:47.000]   put my credit like the idea it's getting to the point where the credit card is like this shung
[02:13:47.000 --> 02:13:52.520]   shung like this slow like why am i doing well it's also uh non-touch so the pandemic is fostered
[02:13:52.520 --> 02:13:57.560]   that as well right when i was in the grocery store of course the first thing i say is you use apple
[02:13:57.560 --> 02:14:00.920]   pay right they said oh yeah of course right because i don't want to touch anything i just want to go
[02:14:00.920 --> 02:14:07.400]   like that with my watch yeah yeah now type in your now type in the yeah exactly you don't have to do
[02:14:07.400 --> 02:14:11.080]   that anymore though that's the greatest thing sometimes though for a while i had to do my pin every
[02:14:11.080 --> 02:14:16.120]   time i use my atm card i guess it's the bank that makes that decision not apple obviously you still
[02:14:16.120 --> 02:14:20.520]   have to do that you still have to do that in whole foods at least in nubato and so i i i
[02:14:20.520 --> 02:14:26.200]   try the funny things i'll be in line in whole foods and i'll transfer money from my my atm account
[02:14:26.200 --> 02:14:30.120]   to your apple account just so that i can make sure that my apple card is the one that's getting
[02:14:30.120 --> 02:14:35.960]   charged that's right that's what happened i stopped using my bank account atm i started using my apple
[02:14:35.960 --> 02:14:39.560]   card that's exactly what happened that's why i don't have any pin anymore yeah it's
[02:14:39.560 --> 02:14:44.360]   no but it just it's just like it's stupid you know and you're just like i don't want to use the atm
[02:14:44.360 --> 02:14:49.640]   because i don't know who i am yeah i don't need to enter a four digit code like that's going to add
[02:14:49.640 --> 02:14:57.400]   any security at all i they need you to because they that's how they that's how they they figure out
[02:14:57.400 --> 02:15:04.760]   who you are as they drag their knuckles along the ground yeah yeah let's take a break and folks your
[02:15:04.760 --> 02:15:09.800]   picks of the week are coming up next but first a word from my pick for vpn and there is no question
[02:15:09.800 --> 02:15:17.400]   about it express vpn did you see the judge the court judge the other day who said wait a minute
[02:15:17.400 --> 02:15:23.480]   incognito mode in chrome doesn't hide your activity from google yeah she was flabbergasted
[02:15:23.480 --> 02:15:30.360]   she was like that's wrong oh sorry your honor that's wrong incognito mode we all learn something
[02:15:30.360 --> 02:15:36.360]   today does not hide your activity uh it doesn't matter frankly what mode you use or how many times
[02:15:36.360 --> 02:15:40.360]   you clear your browsing history because your internet service provider and google can see every
[02:15:40.360 --> 02:15:46.040]   single thing you do google sees every search you make your ispcs every website you visit and every
[02:15:46.040 --> 02:15:52.520]   search you make unless you're using express vpn in fact it's so nice because you could put express
[02:15:52.520 --> 02:15:59.320]   vpn on many routers so that all your traffic is protected now i know in if you've used other vpn's
[02:15:59.320 --> 02:16:03.400]   you might say oh that's going to really slow me down but not express vpn they really invest in
[02:16:03.400 --> 02:16:08.840]   infrastructure invest in servers uh and they're all fast so you don't even notice the fact that
[02:16:08.840 --> 02:16:15.400]   you're going through a vpn but that extra hop hides all of that information from your isp who is
[02:16:15.400 --> 02:16:21.400]   completely legally entitled to record everything you do and sell it to marketers uh every search
[02:16:21.400 --> 02:16:26.120]   your ip address goes to google but if it's not your ip address if it's express vpn's ip address
[02:16:26.120 --> 02:16:31.720]   good luck with that google it doesn't matter if you get your internet from verizon or comcast or any
[02:16:31.720 --> 02:16:38.120]   isp they can legally sell that information on not unless you're using express vpn it's an app that
[02:16:38.120 --> 02:16:42.520]   rerout your internet connection through their secure servers now of course people are going to
[02:16:42.520 --> 02:16:47.720]   say oh what wait now express vpn knows that stuff they do but they don't care they don't want it
[02:16:47.720 --> 02:16:53.240]   they don't log it they don't keep track of it in fact express vpn cares so much about your privacy
[02:16:53.240 --> 02:16:57.720]   they go to the extra effort of using and i think there were the only vpn to do this
[02:16:57.720 --> 02:17:03.480]   a ram based server they call it the trusted server technology when you press the button to
[02:17:03.480 --> 02:17:09.480]   start the vpn it spins this ram based server up stays in ram it's sandbox it cannot write to
[02:17:09.480 --> 02:17:15.080]   disk no matter what it cannot record anything that's happening and then when you leave it
[02:17:15.080 --> 02:17:21.080]   disappears from memory and so does every trace of your visit and i'm not making this up they have
[02:17:21.080 --> 02:17:26.440]   independent third party auditors regularly come in from price water house cooper
[02:17:26.440 --> 02:17:31.880]   they verified that trusted server works exactly that way that the express vpn privacy policy is
[02:17:31.880 --> 02:17:38.920]   exactly as stated that they literally do no logging and express vpn is fast easy to use it's on all
[02:17:38.920 --> 02:17:43.560]   devices you can put it on your phone your computer your smart tv actually that's the first thing
[02:17:43.560 --> 02:17:47.640]   you should put it on is your smart tv because you know this Alex is right you should never give
[02:17:47.640 --> 02:17:52.680]   your tv internet but if you do you probably should run express vpn with it protect your online
[02:17:52.680 --> 02:17:59.800]   activity today with a vpn that is number one rated by cneton wired uh proven safe proven
[02:17:59.800 --> 02:18:05.560]   effective and you know it you're going to say oh i can get a free vpn service yes you can but
[02:18:05.560 --> 02:18:10.200]   they're going to spy on you because they have to monetize somehow express vpn charges are very
[02:18:10.200 --> 02:18:14.920]   fair it's about seven bucks a month that's how come they have such great infrastructure that's
[02:18:14.920 --> 02:18:20.600]   how come you can trust them they don't need a log i think that's a fair price uh for exactly the
[02:18:20.600 --> 02:18:26.200]   best service out there express vpn.com/macbreak actually gives you a bit of a deal sign up for a
[02:18:26.200 --> 02:18:31.000]   one-year package you'll get three months free no matter where you are even at home you want to

[02:19:38.920 --> 02:19:43.480]   he says it's my pick of the week it is mine now from a company called geometric goods
[02:19:43.480 --> 02:19:49.960]   they're at geometricgoods.com they sell through ebay it's a guy it's a polish guy and actually
[02:19:49.960 --> 02:19:55.640]   it's really sweet i gotta show you he sent me a note saying handwritten note saying hello leo
[02:19:55.640 --> 02:20:00.360]   loport thank you so much and i'm gonna so i got a case from and then he threw it threw in the mag
[02:20:00.360 --> 02:20:04.920]   safe wallet so and i don't know what this is but he threw that into i guess it was a little extra
[02:20:04.920 --> 02:20:11.400]   leather this is the case the reason i like it is it's a magsafe case so it uses the magsafe to hold
[02:20:11.400 --> 02:20:16.200]   it on which is nice because there are times i want to use magsafe to charge and most of most
[02:20:16.200 --> 02:20:21.560]   folio cases no folio case including it maybe apples does can charge the back of this this is
[02:20:21.560 --> 02:20:27.960]   really nice thick italian leather it's really really good i told daren okay i'm gonna buy the
[02:20:27.960 --> 02:20:32.120]   same case as you but i'm gonna put my name on it so you won't accidentally confuse it with mine
[02:20:32.120 --> 02:20:39.000]   uh it is really a nice case oh it feels so good and and i just love it that it's so easy i have
[02:20:39.000 --> 02:20:44.280]   you know i had a patent quill folio case but i had to take it out of the case it was a complicated
[02:20:44.280 --> 02:20:51.480]   process now it just detaches and then and then this nice guy roman he sent me a little little
[02:20:51.480 --> 02:20:56.760]   thing on that goes on the back i wouldn't use this because i'm afraid of my my cards falling off
[02:20:56.760 --> 02:21:03.800]   but i know apple but they just sent this along for nothing so highly recommended it's uh it's uh
[02:21:03.800 --> 02:21:10.760]   on the web at geometric goods.com and you can and i'll think that'll send you to their

[02:21:15.880 --> 02:21:21.720]   leather working it smells good and all that so that's my pick of the week thank and thank you daren
[02:21:21.720 --> 02:21:27.960]   for suggesting that on uh to with that social i appreciate it now Alex you were a second to raise
[02:21:27.960 --> 02:21:33.240]   your hand it's your turn so my my pick i i was talking about oat toy is kind of a side pick because
[02:21:33.240 --> 02:21:37.960]   i just want to make sure people knew about it um my pick of the week is actually the um so we can
[02:21:37.960 --> 02:21:46.760]   switch to this uh this is the oc white ultimate ultimate two let's see here oh my god that is the
[02:21:46.760 --> 02:21:51.880]   heavens that is the heaviest duty mic arm it looks like the terminator it is i haven't gotten like
[02:21:51.880 --> 02:21:57.960]   the cable done yet but the the joints and it's an it's an underslung one so it's nice and low profile
[02:21:57.960 --> 02:22:03.880]   and uh it is the best mic arm i have put this off forever because of the price i will admit it
[02:22:03.880 --> 02:22:11.560]   329 bucks so i've been like three hundred twenty dollars for you know for um a mic um but it is uh
[02:22:12.680 --> 02:22:19.480]   it's great like it's like i i finally just was like i'm gonna i'm trying to really get my whole
[02:22:19.480 --> 02:22:25.000]   kit see i don't want to mount it on the table like this because i get uh you know i get the uh
[02:22:25.000 --> 02:22:31.960]   boom boom telegraphing through it but maybe this um is is damped enough that i won't you know yeah
[02:22:31.960 --> 02:22:35.560]   you can you can mount it all kinds of different ways it just comes with a shaft so you can decide
[02:22:35.560 --> 02:22:39.800]   how you're gonna mount it i can put it on you know so you can put on a tripod or something yeah i'm
[02:22:39.800 --> 02:22:44.360]   not even using the right uh i'm not even using there i had already had a mic stand like a
[02:22:44.360 --> 02:22:50.120]   attachment for my table which i this the way i use it um anyway so yeah you can attach it any way you
[02:22:50.120 --> 02:22:56.120]   want um and i was at a podcast studio and and they had six of these around the around the thing and
[02:22:56.120 --> 02:22:59.720]   i just i looked at it and then took years for me to come around to actually bind it because i just
[02:22:59.720 --> 02:23:03.880]   kept on going putting it into the cart and just going i'm not gonna spend three hundred dollars on
[02:23:03.880 --> 02:23:09.400]   a mic stand and then what makes it so good i mean it's just it is just so i stand it is but it's
[02:23:09.400 --> 02:23:14.920]   so it's underslung it's super solid it just has all the joints in the right place like they have it
[02:23:14.920 --> 02:23:18.760]   i don't have mine set up that way like if you look at there that's the one that i wouldn't do it that
[02:23:18.760 --> 02:23:24.520]   way so mine if you look at it again uh let's see you know i lost my iphone this is by the way you know
[02:23:24.520 --> 02:23:29.880]   you're using your are you using your iphone to do this yeah yeah wow that's nice what program are
[02:23:29.880 --> 02:23:38.440]   you using to do that filmic pro so filmic pro has a uh has a um uh filmic pro has a clean out
[02:23:38.440 --> 02:23:42.120]   all right it's on the iphone so i just have this hooked into my atem switch so that's hooked into
[02:23:42.120 --> 02:23:49.480]   the iphone right has a lightning to hdmi connector uh i have this is this is yeah there's a lightning i
[02:23:49.480 --> 02:23:54.040]   have a lightning to hdmi connector on it and those are just cables you can buy has on but then i have
[02:23:54.040 --> 02:23:58.520]   it going into this uh switcher here it really looks more like a bergs thing it looks more like a
[02:23:58.520 --> 02:24:04.040]   monitor armor it looks so heavy duty it is and it's it's solid you know and the thing is so i
[02:24:04.040 --> 02:24:10.280]   slung mine underneath like this yeah so um and it's just super solid and it swings in just the
[02:24:10.280 --> 02:24:14.600]   right way so when i when i step away i just kind of swing it out nice and then i swing it back in
[02:24:14.600 --> 02:24:18.360]   and it's just and it gets out of the way because i've got other monitors up here and the crappiest
[02:24:18.360 --> 02:24:23.880]   mine carbs ever and actually this mic arm is crappy i have high on my uh other studio which is fine
[02:24:23.880 --> 02:24:30.840]   yeah but the higher one is really good it's it's uh um it the higher one is really good this one is
[02:24:30.840 --> 02:24:36.520]   just at a different level you know what's in the what's in the middle part it's good it looks like
[02:24:36.520 --> 02:24:41.080]   you could be storing crackers in there or something it's uh that's uh that's where you run your cable
[02:24:41.080 --> 02:24:45.320]   through it and i just haven't done that yet i i've had there's some there's an intelligence
[02:24:45.320 --> 02:24:49.640]   test here about how to open that up that i've failed so far so i'm i'm working on that i just
[02:24:49.640 --> 02:24:54.280]   have you might have to break down a little bit more into it i saw a whole camera set up on something
[02:24:54.280 --> 02:24:59.960]   looked almost exactly like that as well like a top-down camera yeah yeah and so it's it they make a lot
[02:24:59.960 --> 02:25:05.720]   of um of different ones there but but this one is this is the one i want i want the deluxe triple mic
[02:25:05.720 --> 02:25:11.960]   arm with riser now and i could put that in the studio so look just like the you know the problem
[02:25:11.960 --> 02:25:17.240]   is is that the reason i wanted the interesting one is like for the bricky club oh it's out of the way
[02:25:17.240 --> 02:25:22.600]   yeah it's out of the way so so what happened for me is again if i go back to the camera here
[02:25:22.600 --> 02:25:28.280]   um is that i want to be able to see these monitors here as like yeah yeah yeah and so so having it it
[02:25:28.280 --> 02:25:33.800]   was i had one coming down here and it was now in the way and i couldn't you know get to those and so
[02:25:33.800 --> 02:25:40.920]   that was you know that was problematic so from oc white oc white dot com the pro boom altima gen 2
[02:25:40.920 --> 02:25:47.880]   ultra low profile adjustable mic boom with 12 inch fixed horizontal arm nice i don't know
[02:25:47.880 --> 02:25:54.440]   base plate of pre-formulated amuleite yay oh god you're gonna make me spend money it's so it's so
[02:25:54.440 --> 02:26:01.560]   great oh sorry oh you know i could justify it because that's you know i mean it's your job it's
[02:26:01.560 --> 02:26:08.120]   your job yeah it's it's just crappy thing i'm using this is like something we got i don't know
[02:26:08.120 --> 02:26:14.360]   with a a kit for you know i had the same i was using the same arm that you i use the same arm
[02:26:14.360 --> 02:26:19.160]   that you're using until about a week ago when i get when this showed up or two weeks ago when
[02:26:19.160 --> 02:26:23.320]   it showed up so it was it was exactly the same thing i think i might even look at yours and bought
[02:26:23.320 --> 02:26:27.320]   it and and that's what i've been using and it just well the reason i use this one is it's like floor
[02:26:27.320 --> 02:26:33.400]   stand so i can pound the table it doesn't go i admit that i'm pretty conscious to the fact that i
[02:26:33.400 --> 02:26:36.840]   can't pound the table now if if uh... out of the table let's see what happens
[02:26:36.840 --> 02:26:41.640]   yeah yeah yeah i can hear it but it's not i just don't do that i don't pound the table but this is a
[02:26:41.640 --> 02:26:46.280]   round table in the old days we used to have people sitting at it and invariably there was somebody
[02:26:46.280 --> 02:26:50.840]   who would and i have to say can you stop pounding the table please were they outraged that way they did
[02:26:50.840 --> 02:26:55.640]   yes or it was usually it was usually in tomsen i don't know something about the Brits they're
[02:26:55.640 --> 02:27:04.200]   room yeah they just want to they want to take off their shoe and go i think right that's it's watching
[02:27:04.200 --> 02:27:09.000]   all it's just watching parlament all the all those uh yeah too much parlament they're all yelling at
[02:27:09.000 --> 02:27:15.800]   each other the Brits yep oh this is nice yeah this is like a steven tiler arm i should get some scarves
[02:27:23.240 --> 02:27:29.240]   good pick from oc white i know i only say good picks when it's a pick that i want really badly
[02:27:29.240 --> 02:27:35.240]   it's a good pick well and again i spent probably after seeing it i probably spent two years
[02:27:35.240 --> 02:27:39.960]   putting it off uh yeah like just going i'm not gonna buy it i'm not gonna buy it and i finally
[02:27:39.960 --> 02:27:47.720]   was like i want to buy it yeah so nanny and i co pick of the week sir uh very very common sort of
[02:27:47.720 --> 02:27:58.840]   pick this is i i'm teleporting into the early 2010s by by wearing a fitness tracker oh look at you
[02:27:58.840 --> 02:28:04.440]   it's not a smartwatch it is a fitness tracker which turns out to be the right choice for me for now
[02:28:04.440 --> 02:28:11.720]   is the fitbit charge for cost 150 bucks you can easily get it for like 120 130 and
[02:28:11.720 --> 02:28:17.080]   since the last time i looked at fitness trackers like now the fitness trackers actually have like
[02:28:17.080 --> 02:28:24.520]   all the good stuff this one has uh 24/7 the heart rate monitoring has sleep tracking it has
[02:28:24.520 --> 02:28:33.400]   tap to pay it has uh it has even overnight blood oxygen level for factor for for its
[02:28:33.400 --> 02:28:40.360]   sleep tracking it has not not custom watch faces but it has like enough of a collection of watch
[02:28:40.360 --> 02:28:45.480]   faces available to it that you can just keep like scroll until you find the one like for me
[02:28:45.480 --> 02:28:50.600]   all i want to watch is i want to tell me the time the date tell me what the tell me how many steps
[02:28:50.600 --> 02:28:54.600]   i've done today and tell me what my heart rate is and there's a watch face that gives all of that
[02:28:54.600 --> 02:28:59.960]   it also has a spotify control in addition to the stuff like oh here's what your texts are
[02:28:59.960 --> 02:29:05.880]   here's uh you can even on the android you can even like respond to text but the for me the i
[02:29:05.880 --> 02:29:12.360]   i own like i think of a series three apple watch i own a couple of other like android uh the android
[02:29:12.360 --> 02:29:17.320]   wearer uh smartwatches uh partly to just make sure that i know with how these things work
[02:29:17.320 --> 02:29:21.240]   because you're to have in my hardware library but partly because i kind of want to like be
[02:29:21.240 --> 02:29:26.360]   wearing something that keeps me uh on top of like how much i'm moving and the thing is the i could
[02:29:26.360 --> 02:29:32.280]   never really get into the habit of wearing them uh partly because they were so even the small ones
[02:29:32.280 --> 02:29:36.760]   are so chunky that like when i sit down to type after a couple hours i find myself like taking off
[02:29:36.760 --> 02:29:41.400]   my watch and putting it next to the keyboard and then forgetting it's there and then that's it
[02:29:41.400 --> 02:29:46.200]   but the big thing has always been battery life that i just could never get into the habit of
[02:29:46.200 --> 02:29:51.320]   every day each and every day put it on the charger so that you can use it the next day
[02:29:51.320 --> 02:29:56.840]   and it's not just because hey oh hey the the response to that could be oh well just keep the charger
[02:29:56.840 --> 02:30:01.160]   in your nightstand like take it off when you go to bed but number one i want it for sleep tracking
[02:30:01.160 --> 02:30:05.880]   but also because again oftentimes i will take it off for comfort and then forget it's there
[02:30:05.880 --> 02:30:10.040]   and then it's not ready for me the next day the nice thing about this is that when it says seven
[02:30:10.040 --> 02:30:16.680]   day battery life i mean they really mean it it is so much it is it works for so long off a battery that
[02:30:16.680 --> 02:30:22.120]   it's kind of an event to charge it up and so at least once during the week i will remember to put
[02:30:22.120 --> 02:30:27.720]   it back onto the charger and usually when i put it on charger still got 30 or 40 battery left uh
[02:30:27.720 --> 02:30:34.520]   and that's what really does it for me uh so the the message here is that i'm still hoping that uh
[02:30:34.520 --> 02:30:39.960]   i'm still hoping that there'll be a really full featured smartwatch that really does everything
[02:30:39.960 --> 02:30:46.520]   for me like as soon as the apple watch gets to two or three day battery life i'm in uh but until then
[02:30:46.520 --> 02:30:51.560]   this might be the best solution for me because what one one of the impetus is for for adding another
[02:30:51.560 --> 02:30:58.280]   like tracker or fitness watch to my my my uh retinue was that i i'm not going to get the vaccine
[02:30:58.280 --> 02:31:03.480]   until like mid-April maybe and i'm trying to like get my head around the point where there's going
[02:31:03.480 --> 02:31:09.400]   to be a point at which you are going to have to you're going to have to mainstream yourself
[02:31:09.400 --> 02:31:14.200]   back into like regular i can leave the house whenever i want and do anything i want activity
[02:31:14.200 --> 02:31:18.840]   and i need to i need to get on top of my sleep habits i need to get on top of how much activity
[02:31:18.840 --> 02:31:24.440]   i'm doing like every single day and so i do believe that i absolutely need uh i need some sort of
[02:31:24.440 --> 02:31:30.760]   a tracker on uh 24/7 and this seems to be the solution because i bought it about a month ago and
[02:31:30.760 --> 02:31:36.040]   i don't think i've really missed a day of wearing it oh the other thing is that this is this is popular
[02:31:36.040 --> 02:31:40.920]   uh it's a fitbit so it's popular enough that it does have like interchangeable watch bands and
[02:31:40.920 --> 02:31:46.840]   from third parties i'm i'm wearing the blue millinese loop with the magnetic enclosure oh that's nice
[02:31:46.840 --> 02:31:52.920]   yeah yes so like i said it's giving me enough of the apple watch experience at like half the price
[02:31:52.920 --> 02:31:56.920]   of what i would be willing to pay uh it's not it's not the cheapest one but i think it's at the top
[02:31:56.920 --> 02:32:01.320]   of the line for fitness trackers and it does deliver all of the stuff that i really really want to
[02:32:01.320 --> 02:32:05.400]   mark on how much they're able to get in these things at that price i mean gps is in this i mean
[02:32:05.400 --> 02:32:11.480]   that's uh for 150 bucks that's great yeah with of course when you turn the gps on that's like okay
[02:32:11.480 --> 02:32:16.360]   you got about four hours before really before you never mind it's with that that that turns into like
[02:32:16.360 --> 02:32:20.920]   a one-day watch as opposed to a seven-day watch yeah uh but that's not something that you need
[02:32:20.920 --> 02:32:24.600]   necessarily you need to turn on like all the time anyway that's not something that i would turn
[02:32:24.600 --> 02:32:29.320]   on all the time anyway just when you're running or whatever and exactly yeah so this is uh now
[02:32:29.320 --> 02:32:38.120]   part of google they bought them so uh Fitbits late is the charge for yeah just came out like last
[02:32:38.120 --> 02:32:42.440]   late last year i think october or November yeah so it's a pretty current item i see a whole lot of
[02:32:42.440 --> 02:32:50.120]   Fitbits around uh most people don't want to spend the money on an apple watch i think uh
[02:32:50.120 --> 02:32:57.560]   rene richie it's your turn save the best for last so no not at all but this is going to cost you zero
[02:32:57.560 --> 02:33:03.480]   dollar zero alexes and i think we mentioned it we talked about it for last yes absolutely we think
[02:33:03.480 --> 02:33:08.440]   we talked about it on our news after so they recorded it oh yeah so this was a surprise because
[02:33:08.440 --> 02:33:12.440]   you you you're you're not supposed to record club houses you're supposed to put the word record in
[02:33:12.440 --> 02:33:16.280]   the name of the room if you do you're supposed to get consent from everybody who comes up on stage
[02:33:16.280 --> 02:33:21.240]   verbally as they come up on stage but through magic that i don't want to know about i am completely
[02:33:21.240 --> 02:33:26.600]   happy being totally ignorant on this the computer history museum got a recording of the steve job
[02:33:26.600 --> 02:33:32.200]   stories uh club album that they ran on the occasion of his birthday i was so sad that i missed this i
[02:33:32.200 --> 02:33:37.720]   found out about the next day and i was just devastated because it's everybody i mean we've talked to
[02:33:37.720 --> 02:33:44.280]   many of these people but the great anti-hertzfeld um uh lots of other people
[02:33:44.280 --> 02:33:52.120]   every and they work at apple and so many of them it's just it's really a great group of people
[02:33:52.120 --> 02:33:57.880]   um mike slayed you're like chris fralick seth godin was on it i don't know why did he used to work
[02:33:57.880 --> 02:34:05.640]   for apple and he cunning him daniel luan that's really amazing steve job stories yeah and i don't
[02:34:05.640 --> 02:34:09.800]   like i don't want to get too spoil spoilery but you'll hear things about like steve jobs recruiting
[02:34:09.800 --> 02:34:13.080]   people and then them going to the restaurant and seeing the recruitment speech on the menu
[02:34:13.080 --> 02:34:19.960]   the restaurant or like steve jobs being adamantly adamantly opposed to drm and then hearing about
[02:34:19.960 --> 02:34:26.440]   what it could do for the ipod and and flipping around like 180 degrees so fast uh there's just
[02:34:26.440 --> 02:34:32.600]   it is so rich and like it's not idolatry it's not psychofancy it's real stories from the real
[02:34:32.600 --> 02:34:38.120]   people who worked with them yeah yeah i'm so glad i was recorded i felt so bad that i lost i missed it
[02:34:38.680 --> 02:34:41.640]   uh thank you computer history museum for breaking all the rules
[02:34:41.640 --> 02:34:46.360]   and recording it uh it is on youtube maybe they got permission after the fact that's

[02:36:37.400 --> 02:36:42.360]   thing and it i didn't realize it was a tuesday and then it was too late it's a government thing
[02:36:42.360 --> 02:36:47.240]   it doesn't have anything okay technology but it's so hard to change government things can't change
[02:36:47.240 --> 02:36:51.560]   government things it's okay no i actually wish you hadn't told us that because it would have been
[02:36:51.560 --> 02:36:56.440]   so much fun to think oh yeah rene's getting the apple briefing actually like play it off next week
[02:36:56.920 --> 02:37:00.760]   i'll i'll contradict it it's not nearly as interesting to think oh yeah he's hanging out with the
[02:37:00.760 --> 02:37:05.640]   Canadian government it just doesn't just yeah rene just just just be a sport and like post an
[02:37:05.640 --> 02:37:11.240]   instagram of like your apple watch at an airport yes just just for old sprits sake just to remind us
[02:37:11.240 --> 02:37:16.760]   what the normal time used to feel like oh nanny not go that when you yeah we all remember that and
[02:37:16.760 --> 02:37:24.200]   it's coming back some day soon i feel it i feel it i think we're getting there and he went on ub on
[02:37:24.200 --> 02:37:30.520]   wgph boston next um i usual half hour hi tech hi dio is going to be at one p.m on thursday today
[02:37:30.520 --> 02:37:36.440]   go to wgph news.org live or later in order to stream it and i think everybody knows that Alex
[02:37:36.440 --> 02:37:43.320]   lindsey spends his time in front of a microphone with a very nice stand uh thank you it's called
[02:37:43.320 --> 02:37:49.160]   office hours and you can catch it well the i think the thing to do is either follow Alex on twitter
[02:37:49.160 --> 02:37:55.080]   aliex l-i-n-d-s-a-y or go to his youtube channel if you go to his youtube channel you can see
[02:37:55.080 --> 02:38:00.280]   recordings of some of the office hours stuff but the whole thing is mostly not recorded so
[02:38:00.280 --> 02:38:06.920]   what you the trick is go to one of the recordings and then go look uh in the oh that one's new it
[02:38:06.920 --> 02:38:10.920]   may not be updated oh yes that's the night one golden that's that was last night that was last
[02:38:10.920 --> 02:38:16.120]   night he does it all the free again time it's 24/7 it's amazing it's gonna
[02:38:16.760 --> 02:38:21.880]   kind of say that the old the only thing you need to know about uh Alex's credibility as a streamer
[02:38:21.880 --> 02:38:28.280]   and for for for for live casting is the greater the disparity between the tidiness of the background
[02:38:28.280 --> 02:38:33.480]   and the titans of the desk before him the more credibility this person has yep you never want
[02:38:33.480 --> 02:38:37.960]   to wait you never want to get the reverse camera angle no it's kind of an old testament mess in
[02:38:37.960 --> 02:38:42.360]   front of you with all the equipment and then the cleanest most beautifully lit plane background
[02:38:42.360 --> 02:38:47.080]   before you that's why he gets the real deal that's why you find that you signed that check
[02:38:47.080 --> 02:38:52.280]   you I got a ruin that allows you tonight like because like we're always talking
[02:38:52.280 --> 02:38:58.520]   yeah one of that's i got to say what a mess we're always talking about all the things so
[02:38:58.520 --> 02:39:03.320]   so the thing is is it's we're always talking about all these things so in on office hours and so
[02:39:03.320 --> 02:39:06.840]   all these things are like within hand reach because we're always picking up and showing them and so
[02:39:06.840 --> 02:39:11.240]   there's always these like you kind of have all these like props that you're kind of picking up and
[02:39:11.240 --> 02:39:15.880]   and they're all just within arm arms reach or just over it's heaven for content creators and
[02:39:15.880 --> 02:39:21.160]   actually there is a bitly url bit.ly/theofficehours
[02:39:21.160 --> 02:39:26.440]   camel caps camel caps yeah because if you don't if you don't it goes something weird something else
[02:39:26.440 --> 02:39:31.480]   but so it's i it was a mistake but i can't there's so many people that have that link now um so uh yeah
[02:39:31.480 --> 02:39:36.600]   yeah there's capital t capital o capital h the office hours and then it's Alex Lindsay as well
