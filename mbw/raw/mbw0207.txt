[00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:31.880]   Welcome back to Macbreak Weekly.
[00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:32.720]   This is Alex Lindsey.
[00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:34.680]   I'm sitting in for Leo.
[00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.120]   And we've got a stellar cast here in the studio.
[00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:44.240]   We have the one, the only, Frederick Van Johnson.
[00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.740]   Hello.
[00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:45.560]   It's good to have you up here.
[00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:46.600]   It's good to be up here.
[00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:47.560]   Now that you're here.
[00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:48.360]   Now that I'm here.
[00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:49.560]   We were a little concerned about you.
[00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.840]   I was-- yeah, it took me--
[00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.440]   it took forever to get up here.
[00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:55.240]   It was 90 minutes from San Jose.
[00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:56.920]   That's not right.
[00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:58.240]   It's just for the three hour drive?
[00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:59.800]   Yeah, for those of you listening,
[00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:03.560]   it's an hour and a half to San Francisco from San Jose.
[00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:05.320]   Not an hour and a half from--
[00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:09.640]   so there was some serious math that Frederick was bending.
[00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:11.040]   There was a black hole in there somewhere.
[00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:12.080]   I just went in and came out.
[00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.600]   I was here.
[00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:13.840]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:17.800]   Coming in from Boston, we have Andy Nodko, of course.
[00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:18.800]   Hey, Lou.
[00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:23.160]   And man, the camera gets better and better every week.
[00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:25.200]   Well, I guess, yeah, I took that course in cinematography,
[00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:25.760]   like I was saying.
[00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:28.520]   So I know next week, I'm going to be like this.
[00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:31.520]   I've been watching old episodes of "The Tom Snyder Tomorrow Show."
[00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:32.000]   Yeah.
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.800]   And I've decided that if I have some black drape behind me
[00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:37.280]   and have a cigarette held like thusly,
[00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:39.920]   with a little spot here just to catch the cigarette smoke,
[00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:44.320]   I think I will sound far more arbine to the point
[00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:46.920]   and intellectual than if I'm just standing here like this
[00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:49.280]   and just drinking soda and not smoking at all.
[00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:50.480]   So it's an evolving process.
[00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:53.000]   We're getting more dollars in for the studio production.
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.480]   Yes.
[00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:55.440]   And we'll get some of that back into the pension fund
[00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:56.400]   as soon as possible.
[00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:58.280]   It was just a bookkeeping error.
[00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:01.240]   Yeah, I really think looking at some good Boris Karloff
[00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:03.360]   would be really a great addition.
[00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:04.360]   I was watching a lot of it.
[00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:06.240]   Someone asked me to impersonate Boris Karloff
[00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:08.400]   for a voiceover last night.
[00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:08.880]   Oh, yeah?
[00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:10.880]   And so I was watching lots of it on YouTube.
[00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:12.480]   And I was like, wow, there's a lot of good movies
[00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:13.560]   I haven't seen.
[00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:17.200]   So anyway, also coming in from across the pond,
[00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:20.640]   we have Don McAllister, hey Don, from Screencast online.
[00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:22.120]   Hi, Alex. Hi, how's it going?
[00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:22.520]   Good.
[00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:24.440]   And it's a late night for you, isn't it?
[00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:25.400]   Oh, it's not too bad.
[00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:26.600]   It's sort of early evening.
[00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:28.280]   But by the apologies for last week,
[00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:29.440]   I know I was supposed to be on last week,
[00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:32.040]   but circumstances were against me last week.
[00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:33.800]   But I'm glad I could make it this week anyway.
[00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:34.600]   And we are too.
[00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:38.120]   And now rumor has it that you have a special deal
[00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:41.760]   for people who are actually watching Macbreak weekly,
[00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:44.440]   especially the offer Screencast online?
[00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:46.080]   Ah, yeah, it was actually one of the things
[00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:47.280]   I was going to bring up last week.
[00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:50.040]   And that made it all even more disappointing that I couldn't do it.
[00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:52.560]   But yeah, basically, I suddenly realized a couple of weeks ago
[00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:54.920]   that I'd never actually done a sort of special promotion.
[00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:56.720]   For people that don't know, I run Screencast online,
[00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:58.720]   which is a video tutorial site.
[00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:00.080]   And it's a membership scheme.
[00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:02.720]   I do sort of like one show every month, which is for free.
[00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:05.960]   But the other three shows every week, rather three shows at one
[00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:07.600]   every week is for members.
[00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:10.680]   And it's $57 normally, but I decided to go mad
[00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:14.000]   and do a 50% discount for Macbreak weekly viewers and listeners.
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.600]   So if anyone's interested in my stuff,
[00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:19.360]   I've got about 260 videos now on the site.
[00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:20.840]   You can sort of download immediately.
[00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:22.080]   And it's a killer.
[00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:24.360]   Yeah, it's well, I like to think so.
[00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:25.000]   I think the same.
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.760]   But the basic Screencast, so they take you through all the different packages
[00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:30.760]   that come out, not just the Apple stuff,
[00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:32.960]   but also really good third party stuff as well,
[00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:34.680]   and hardware devices, et cetera.
[00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:38.400]   Now, what do they need again to take advantage of this offer?
[00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:43.400]   Just go across to screencastonline.com/extra, which is the normal signing up page,
[00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:45.000]   and click on the link down at the bottom.
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   And when you get to the payment processing,
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.760]   there's a coupon code, which is just Macbreak weekly.
[00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:52.040]   Mac's 50% off.
[00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:52.760]   Macbreak weekly.
[00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:53.320]   So check that out.
[00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:56.080]   It's 50% off and definitely worth it.
[00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:58.840]   So check it out, Donna Callister from Screencast Online.
[00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:01.920]   And our first story of the day--
[00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:04.160]   and I don't know how big of a deal this is.
[00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:09.800]   This is Mark Papermaster, the Apple executive in charge of the hardware
[00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:11.440]   for the company's flagship iPhone.
[00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:13.080]   This is according to the New York Times.
[00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:16.920]   Has left the company in the wake of the widely reported problems
[00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:19.880]   with the antenna recently introduced in the iPhone 4.
[00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:26.080]   So it seems like he left pretty abruptly after they kind of sorted everything out,
[00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:27.400]   and then he popped out.
[00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:32.880]   So Frederick, was he pushed out, or did he jump out the window?
[00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:34.680]   I have no idea.
[00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:37.600]   And we will never, ever, ever know.
[00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:39.000]   When asked, he said, of course, no comment.
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:40.360]   Right, yeah, of course.
[00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:43.120]   But I mean, who knows?
[00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:46.480]   As someone who used to work at Cupertino.
[00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:50.280]   At levels much lower than the level that Mr. Papermaster was asked.
[00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:50.880]   Much greater.
[00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:52.560]   Much, much further from the sun.
[00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:55.000]   Much further from the radiation of the sun.
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:59.640]   But from what I've read-- all I know is what everybody else is reading, right?
[00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:04.000]   So from what I've read and extrapolating from my experiences at the company
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.560]   and with corporate companies in general when something huge like that happens,
[00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:11.160]   maybe stranger things have happened.
[00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:11.760]   Look at HP.
[00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:12.760]   Right.
[00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:13.280]   Yes.
[00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:13.760]   Exactly.
[00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:15.120]   It could be.
[00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:17.080]   When compared, it could be worse.
[00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:21.440]   Now, Andy, do you think this was really over the antenna?
[00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:25.320]   Do you think he had to take the sword, so to speak, for the antenna?
[00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:28.200]   Or do you think this was more of an overall personality conflict?
[00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:33.120]   Honestly, I kind of have two reactions to it.
[00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:38.400]   Number one being that Apple doesn't seem like the sort of company that would say,
[00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:40.720]   one of your products is causing us a lot of grief.
[00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:42.800]   And so we need to make it ceremonial firing.
[00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:46.480]   And congratulations, you just grew the sword straw.
[00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:48.600]   You get one more trip to the Apple store to get those cool,
[00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:49.920]   like visit the mothership t-shirts.
[00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:52.680]   And then you're out.
[00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:54.480]   I mean, that's just an offhand opinion.
[00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:57.040]   But I mean, I've read so much about this.
[00:06:57.040 --> 00:06:59.120]   And all of it is, well, I talked to this guy who thought,
[00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:01.640]   and this guy who didn't want to be named said his impression was.
[00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:04.760]   And he theorized that because this guy was hired during this time,
[00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:10.200]   and I rarely-- I mean, this is an Apple trades.
[00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:12.760]   People who follow Apple trades in so many different rumors,
[00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:15.560]   because there's so many really interesting things happening in the pipeline
[00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:16.560]   at any given moment.
[00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:20.440]   And so we're no strangers to the idea of, well, we took this one grain of sand
[00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:24.840]   that we found inside this one carpet and see a side it into an entire case
[00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:26.720]   of the proving one thing or another.
[00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:31.600]   I have rarely seen such a groundswell of totally unfounded guesswork
[00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:36.040]   and rumors masquerading as an actual issue or as an actual story.
[00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:41.360]   I mean, my opinion is that he got-- he took this job for whatever reason
[00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:42.160]   it didn't work out.
[00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:44.720]   Not a good story for him, not a good story for Apple.
[00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:48.320]   And I bet that as he's emptying out his office, the last thing he needs
[00:07:48.320 --> 00:07:51.520]   is other people taking guesses as to, well, I don't think there was
[00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:53.120]   chemistry between him and Steve Jobs.
[00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:54.760]   I mean, this is Apple.
[00:07:54.760 --> 00:07:55.920]   This isn't Jersey Shore.
[00:07:55.920 --> 00:07:58.280]   And we're better than the people who watch Jersey Shore.
[00:07:58.280 --> 00:08:01.600]   So let's just not even care about this, because it does not affect our lives
[00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:02.880]   one single tiny bit.
[00:08:02.880 --> 00:08:05.440]   And that's, of course, the question the last question I have for Don.
[00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:06.320]   Does this really matter?
[00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:07.880]   Does this affect us at all?
[00:08:07.880 --> 00:08:09.880]   Does it say anything about Apple?
[00:08:09.880 --> 00:08:10.680]   Not really.
[00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:11.640]   I don't think so.
[00:08:11.640 --> 00:08:13.840]   I have to agree with the other guys as well.
[00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:16.360]   The thing is, he's a relatively new hire.
[00:08:16.360 --> 00:08:18.840]   I think he only came in about 12 or 18 months ago.
[00:08:18.840 --> 00:08:20.800]   And it was quite controversial when he did come across,
[00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:22.360]   because he was an ex-IBM guy.
[00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:24.880]   But I sort of was led to believe there was more on the processor
[00:08:24.880 --> 00:08:27.120]   design side rather than the antenna side.
[00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:30.680]   And I know, again, there's lots of speculation and rumor around the net.
[00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:33.560]   And I think I even read somewhere that he's actually called--
[00:08:33.560 --> 00:08:37.600]   or someone said that he was referred to as the antenna guy in Apple,
[00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:38.840]   which I find hard to believe.
[00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:40.480]   But I don't think it's really going to matter.
[00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:42.560]   I think it's just, as Andy said, it's just something that didn't work out.
[00:08:42.560 --> 00:08:46.720]   He's been there for such a short time that it's not as though, really,
[00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:49.200]   he's had a lot of time to make many mistakes.
[00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:51.640]   I wouldn't have thought for that length of time.
[00:08:51.640 --> 00:08:53.040]   It's probably just something that didn't work out.
[00:08:53.040 --> 00:08:54.840]   And we'll move on.
[00:08:54.840 --> 00:08:58.760]   And now that we are moving on, we have the big rumor, of course, this week.
[00:08:58.760 --> 00:09:00.920]   I think this is the big rumor.
[00:09:00.920 --> 00:09:02.160]   I know I'm excited.
[00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:04.760]   Is the iPod refresh coming next week?
[00:09:04.760 --> 00:09:10.400]   So this is citing sources, citing a reliable source within Apple.
[00:09:10.400 --> 00:09:13.520]   Mac Magazine pegs the unveiling of the next generation iPod
[00:09:13.520 --> 00:09:16.240]   between August 14th and August 16th.
[00:09:16.240 --> 00:09:18.440]   Fairly, fairly tight window.
[00:09:18.440 --> 00:09:20.240]   And it's coming to be really close.
[00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:21.720]   So this is next week.
[00:09:21.720 --> 00:09:25.640]   And this is the first two days where Saturday is something that's not going to happen.
[00:09:25.640 --> 00:09:29.320]   To me, it seems like the 17th is always the more likely date.
[00:09:29.320 --> 00:09:32.640]   And the reason, by the way, if you're listening and those of us in the press,
[00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:34.600]   we'll tell you that Tuesdays are good days to do things,
[00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:36.760]   because you have the rest of the week to throw it,
[00:09:36.760 --> 00:09:39.120]   but you give everybody Monday to prepare.
[00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:41.480]   You don't want to make the press work on the weekend.
[00:09:41.480 --> 00:09:44.120]   So Monday, they can fly in.
[00:09:44.120 --> 00:09:45.480]   They can prepare their notes.
[00:09:45.480 --> 00:09:47.240]   They can get everything done.
[00:09:47.240 --> 00:09:49.160]   And then Tuesday, you do whatever you're going to do.
[00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:51.600]   You'll notice that a lot of the Apple events are on.
[00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:54.120]   Not all of them, but a lot of them are on Tuesdays.
[00:09:54.120 --> 00:09:56.480]   Fridays tend to be the worst day to do it, except for Mondays.
[00:09:56.480 --> 00:09:58.160]   And Friday afternoon is bad.
[00:09:58.160 --> 00:10:00.800]   It's like a disaster.
[00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:02.520]   So anyway, so we have an announcement.
[00:10:02.520 --> 00:10:04.840]   So if you're going to plan an announcement, you're not reacting to something.
[00:10:04.840 --> 00:10:08.520]   And of course, if you want to say something and have it just be buried,
[00:10:08.520 --> 00:10:12.080]   you do it towards the end of the week, Thursday or Friday, which is what Apple did with the antenna.
[00:10:12.080 --> 00:10:13.880]   Yeah, yeah, antenna.
[00:10:13.880 --> 00:10:16.280]   And we are going to lose $100 million.
[00:10:16.280 --> 00:10:17.680]   And that's usually on Friday at six.
[00:10:17.680 --> 00:10:23.000]   And so anyway, this is a refresh that possibly is coming.
[00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:28.360]   I mean, I think we all knew it had to be refreshed after you see what's happened with the iPhone.
[00:10:28.360 --> 00:10:31.320]   What do we think is going to be, Andy, what do you think is the number one thing
[00:10:31.320 --> 00:10:36.120]   that we're going to see in this new version if it is released next week?
[00:10:36.120 --> 00:10:40.200]   Definitely I think we're all looking for an iPod touch with a camera,
[00:10:40.200 --> 00:10:45.000]   because there's too much evidence that this has been a high on their priority list for a long time.
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:49.560]   And also now they have a technology for streaming video, an Apple technology for streaming video
[00:10:49.560 --> 00:10:54.600]   over Wi-Fi that does not necessarily require a 3G signal that could make the iPod touch
[00:10:54.600 --> 00:11:01.120]   into yet more emphatically part of the iPhone line as opposed to the last gasp of the iPod line.
[00:11:01.120 --> 00:11:04.560]   So that's the only thing that I can really think of that we could really anticipate,
[00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:08.640]   apart from the usual speed boost and apart from the usual RAM boost.
[00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:15.440]   So you get iOS, iOS 4, of course, on it.
[00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:16.680]   We get a new processor.
[00:11:16.680 --> 00:11:18.880]   We get a new processor.
[00:11:18.880 --> 00:11:21.840]   Do we think a front-facing camera as well?
[00:11:21.840 --> 00:11:22.280]   Fred?
[00:11:22.280 --> 00:11:25.080]   I definitely think it's going to have-- well, here I go.
[00:11:25.080 --> 00:11:26.320]   Saying definitely.
[00:11:26.320 --> 00:11:27.480]   Actually, definitely.
[00:11:27.480 --> 00:11:30.840]   Definitely the rumors say that it will have a front-facing camera.
[00:11:30.840 --> 00:11:34.160]   But yeah, I think it's inevitable that it will have a camera in the front.
[00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:35.120]   Everybody's calling for that.
[00:11:35.120 --> 00:11:39.200]   And I think it makes sense, especially like Andy said, with FaceTime out there.
[00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:42.920]   And some of the other things that we're going to talk about later, it's--
[00:11:42.920 --> 00:11:44.360]   you have to do it.
[00:11:44.360 --> 00:11:48.360]   What I'm wondering, though, is industrial design, because I care about that.
[00:11:48.360 --> 00:11:51.560]   Don't we think it'll look a lot like the 4?
[00:11:51.560 --> 00:11:55.360]   I'm hoping that it looks like the 4.
[00:11:55.360 --> 00:11:56.320]   And who cares?
[00:11:56.320 --> 00:11:58.640]   The antenna won't matter.
[00:11:58.640 --> 00:12:02.200]   That's what we're going to do with the old cases that they're scrapping with the new design.
[00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:05.560]   It's like, we've got something to do with the old cases now, you know?
[00:12:05.560 --> 00:12:06.400]   Don, you were saying--
[00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:08.760]   There's a thing as well that they'll probably include.
[00:12:08.760 --> 00:12:11.640]   And that's the gyroscope, which really, when it first came out,
[00:12:11.640 --> 00:12:14.200]   I would sort of scratch my head as to the use of the gyroscope.
[00:12:14.200 --> 00:12:18.560]   But seeing it being used in some games, and the difference it makes in augmented reality
[00:12:18.560 --> 00:12:21.520]   as well when there's some augmented reality apps,
[00:12:21.520 --> 00:12:25.720]   I would imagine that it's something that's more than likely going to be in the next I pod.
[00:12:25.720 --> 00:12:27.920]   But whether or not it's going to happen next week, I don't know.
[00:12:27.920 --> 00:12:29.800]   I think you really think that's going to happen.
[00:12:29.800 --> 00:12:35.600]   It seems awfully out of sequence, and it doesn't really give them much chance to actually promote it.
[00:12:35.600 --> 00:12:36.600]   Well, it does--
[00:12:36.600 --> 00:12:39.920]   When I first heard about that, the first thing I did was to look at the editorial calendar
[00:12:39.920 --> 00:12:44.200]   for September to see if there was already another big announcement happening in September,
[00:12:44.200 --> 00:12:47.040]   not just with Apple, but maybe with some other company.
[00:12:47.040 --> 00:12:51.320]   And maybe Apple wanted to get either a leap start on what was being released then,
[00:12:51.320 --> 00:12:55.760]   or if they just wanted to put some air around their iPod announcements.
[00:12:55.760 --> 00:12:58.480]   I honestly have no idea whether this is happening or not.
[00:12:58.480 --> 00:13:02.480]   My guess would be no, only because Apple's never done it this early, but who knows?
[00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:04.280]   Normally, September is the window.
[00:13:04.280 --> 00:13:08.880]   So if they're going to-- when they update it, you get the hit from the back to school people.
[00:13:08.880 --> 00:13:11.880]   You also get the hit from the pre-holiday shopping people.
[00:13:11.880 --> 00:13:16.760]   The only advantage of doing it in August is that you could say the thing where, OK,
[00:13:16.760 --> 00:13:23.920]   well, Mom, Dad, you're already $24,800 in debt for this school semester.
[00:13:23.920 --> 00:13:28.160]   Let's round it up to an even $25,000 and buy the kid an iPod touch as well.
[00:13:28.160 --> 00:13:30.880]   Well, it seems like a great solution for me.
[00:13:30.880 --> 00:13:35.320]   And this is related to the next story that we have here, which is that Apple is adding email-based
[00:13:35.320 --> 00:13:38.480]   FaceTime into the beta 3 of iOS 4.
[00:13:38.480 --> 00:13:43.760]   So in this is according to Mac Rumors, Apple's latest beta version of iOS 4.1,
[00:13:43.760 --> 00:13:48.200]   released earlier this week, has offered the strongest evidence that the company is going
[00:13:48.200 --> 00:13:54.000]   to roll out FaceTime video and functionality to other things, non-iPhone uses.
[00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:59.720]   This new option, the iOS context application allows users to make FaceTime calls using
[00:13:59.720 --> 00:14:04.000]   either the phone number or an email address.
[00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.840]   So we're now starting to link people not just to their phone number.
[00:14:06.840 --> 00:14:11.640]   And this is something that I could see being more likely to buy my kids.
[00:14:11.640 --> 00:14:13.240]   I bought my kids iPhones.
[00:14:13.240 --> 00:14:18.160]   In some ways, I could see myself more likely to buy them and I touch or for younger kids
[00:14:18.160 --> 00:14:21.040]   where I don't necessarily-- not really everybody to give them a phone yet and have them run
[00:14:21.040 --> 00:14:22.040]   up that charge.
[00:14:22.040 --> 00:14:25.720]   But I want to be able to-- a lot of times they're in a Wi-Fi enabled environment.
[00:14:25.720 --> 00:14:28.600]   We're moving towards this idea where 90% of our time--
[00:14:28.600 --> 00:14:29.600]   Fred?
[00:14:29.600 --> 00:14:34.560]   I mean, for me, again, putting on my Apple hat, not as an Apple X-Apple employee, but
[00:14:34.560 --> 00:14:41.960]   as somebody who buys their products, what I'm looking at this stuff and I'm thinking,
[00:14:41.960 --> 00:14:43.440]   we've been doing that forever.
[00:14:43.440 --> 00:14:49.000]   I mean, we've had iChat, which is using email as the identifier forever.
[00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:53.200]   And we haven't seen a refresh of iChat in the last 100 years or so.
[00:14:53.200 --> 00:14:58.080]   So maybe we're just looking at the next level of iChat with FaceTime incorporated.
[00:14:58.080 --> 00:15:00.320]   iChat already has FaceTime, right?
[00:15:00.320 --> 00:15:06.440]   Well, the other thing that I noticed when I first did the-- my first at the FaceChat
[00:15:06.440 --> 00:15:11.960]   with you was that the sound is actually the same ringing sound as iChat.
[00:15:11.960 --> 00:15:12.960]   Right.
[00:15:12.960 --> 00:15:13.960]   Yeah.
[00:15:13.960 --> 00:15:18.320]   So maybe we're looking at-- I'm hypothesizing here, but maybe it's a refresh of iChat with
[00:15:18.320 --> 00:15:21.480]   FaceTime capabilities in it, and now iChat is everywhere.
[00:15:21.480 --> 00:15:30.400]   Now, Don, do you think that we are going to see an integration of FaceTime with iChat?
[00:15:30.400 --> 00:15:32.640]   I think it's a given, really.
[00:15:32.640 --> 00:15:34.880]   I mean, not just for the Mac.
[00:15:34.880 --> 00:15:37.720]   I mean, I would love to see it come to the Mac because at the moment, you know, you're
[00:15:37.720 --> 00:15:41.400]   severely limited with just iPhone 4 to iPhone 4 for FaceTime.
[00:15:41.400 --> 00:15:46.920]   And during the keynote at WWDC Steve did say, "There's going to be millions and millions
[00:15:46.920 --> 00:15:49.720]   of iOS 4 devices enabled for FaceTime."
[00:15:49.720 --> 00:15:53.960]   I don't think he said those exact words, but he sort of said, "It's not just the iPhone.
[00:15:53.960 --> 00:15:54.960]   It wasn't just the iPhone.
[00:15:54.960 --> 00:15:57.480]   It's actually going to be rolled out to the iOS 4 devices."
[00:15:57.480 --> 00:16:00.280]   And of course, that includes the iPad as well.
[00:16:00.280 --> 00:16:04.240]   Obviously, not this particular release because there's no camera in it, but I could see it
[00:16:04.240 --> 00:16:08.720]   as part of their ongoing strategy that they would want to really enable FaceTime across
[00:16:08.720 --> 00:16:11.480]   all their devices, all their iOS 4 devices.
[00:16:11.480 --> 00:16:12.480]   Yeah.
[00:16:12.480 --> 00:16:18.520]   And I find it, I have to admit that I'm amazed that we couldn't do FaceTime to the iChat
[00:16:18.520 --> 00:16:20.200]   immediately, that you couldn't do it.
[00:16:20.200 --> 00:16:24.080]   It seemed like it was just a natural because they already had all the systems in play.
[00:16:24.080 --> 00:16:27.440]   Andy, is there any reason why Apple would put that off?
[00:16:27.440 --> 00:16:31.240]   The only thing I can think of is if they have any agreements with AT&T dating back to their
[00:16:31.240 --> 00:16:35.680]   first iPhone 1 agreement saying that Apple agrees that they're not going to get into telephony
[00:16:35.680 --> 00:16:40.840]   over Wi-Fi and an official capacity until the agreement expires, but that's just a guess.
[00:16:40.840 --> 00:16:44.360]   It's also just as possible that they just simply weren't very interested in this sort
[00:16:44.360 --> 00:16:50.800]   of thing as technology until now we get into the area where, gee, this is a banner feature
[00:16:50.800 --> 00:16:55.800]   of our hot new iPhone, let's deploy it across the entire platform like this.
[00:16:55.800 --> 00:16:56.800]   I agree with Don.
[00:16:56.800 --> 00:17:02.960]   I mean, the most alarming thing from the keynote was 10 million devices by the end of the year.
[00:17:02.960 --> 00:17:03.960]   That's very interesting.
[00:17:03.960 --> 00:17:08.560]   And of course, that was right while he was talking about that they're going to open the
[00:17:08.560 --> 00:17:12.600]   new technology to anybody who wants to use it, which might have made other people think
[00:17:12.600 --> 00:17:16.680]   that, well, maybe he meant that Nokia is going to adopt it and Microsoft's going to adopt
[00:17:16.680 --> 00:17:19.920]   it and Android's going to adopt it and whoever wants to put a FaceTime app on their phone
[00:17:19.920 --> 00:17:21.360]   is free to do so.
[00:17:21.360 --> 00:17:24.760]   But obviously, I think that it's more about an expansion into iChat.
[00:17:24.760 --> 00:17:28.880]   I think initially into the desktops and then onto other iOS devices.
[00:17:28.880 --> 00:17:29.880]   Yeah.
[00:17:29.880 --> 00:17:33.440]   Now, I mean, it could be cynical, Alex, though, to think I'm not sure if Apple would actually
[00:17:33.440 --> 00:17:38.360]   do this, but perhaps just restrict the FaceTime to the initial launch of the iPhone 4.
[00:17:38.360 --> 00:17:39.360]   Right.
[00:17:39.360 --> 00:17:42.960]   You know, how many extra iPhone 4s did they actually sell because of FaceTime?
[00:17:42.960 --> 00:17:47.080]   You know, who might have just been buying one and then saw FaceTime thought right over
[00:17:47.080 --> 00:17:49.680]   by another one for the wife or by another one for my grandparents?
[00:17:49.680 --> 00:17:52.680]   Well, I have to admit that that's been me.
[00:17:52.680 --> 00:17:54.600]   I mean, the whole thing is I'm waiting.
[00:17:54.600 --> 00:17:59.920]   You can't still get an iPhone easily, but I'm looking at getting ones for my kids, for
[00:17:59.920 --> 00:18:02.000]   my parents, for my parents in law.
[00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:04.200]   You know, just one for the pair.
[00:18:04.200 --> 00:18:05.200]   Yeah.
[00:18:05.200 --> 00:18:06.200]   But one for each of the kids.
[00:18:06.200 --> 00:18:08.280]   It's like, don't buy them the whole iPhone.
[00:18:08.280 --> 00:18:11.880]   Well, if the eye touch comes out, I'm going to get them the eye touch because the whole
[00:18:11.880 --> 00:18:14.440]   thing is is that they don't need a new phone.
[00:18:14.440 --> 00:18:16.120]   They don't want a new phone.
[00:18:16.120 --> 00:18:19.280]   You know, they're happy with their Verizon or whatever they have.
[00:18:19.280 --> 00:18:20.680]   So I don't really want to replace their phone.
[00:18:20.680 --> 00:18:25.800]   What I really want is just something that I can do FaceTime with that doesn't use a computer
[00:18:25.800 --> 00:18:29.280]   because it's, you know, for my parents and for my parents in law, they just don't spend
[00:18:29.280 --> 00:18:30.280]   much time in front of the computer.
[00:18:30.280 --> 00:18:34.440]   But if they had a handheld way to do FaceTime, you know, I think that that is, I'm looking
[00:18:34.440 --> 00:18:37.800]   at the, I'm looking at the iPod touch, assuming that it's going to have all these features
[00:18:37.800 --> 00:18:41.080]   that we think it's going to have like a FaceTime and the phone facing camera and all that.
[00:18:41.080 --> 00:18:45.720]   You know, frankly, I'm looking at it as the replacement for the landline in the house,
[00:18:45.720 --> 00:18:46.720]   you know.
[00:18:46.720 --> 00:18:49.680]   So you have these things sort of in the house, in the living room, in the kitchen, whatever.
[00:18:49.680 --> 00:18:51.200]   Or Starbucks or wherever.
[00:18:51.200 --> 00:18:52.200]   Yeah.
[00:18:52.200 --> 00:18:54.800]   And it just becomes, well, if I'm in Starbucks, I'm going to have my phone with me.
[00:18:54.800 --> 00:18:59.360]   But the thing is, is that when you look at it, though, Starbucks now has, it's all free.
[00:18:59.360 --> 00:19:00.360]   So the Wi-Fi is free.
[00:19:00.360 --> 00:19:01.360]   Right.
[00:19:01.360 --> 00:19:04.600]   And the reason is that we, you know, we could be, you could theoretically be doing FaceTime
[00:19:04.600 --> 00:19:05.600]   from Starbucks.
[00:19:05.600 --> 00:19:08.240]   Of course, if everyone does FaceTime from Starbucks, then no one will.
[00:19:08.240 --> 00:19:09.240]   Yeah.
[00:19:09.240 --> 00:19:12.600]   Now, now, now, now, Andy, do you think, uh, good catch?
[00:19:12.600 --> 00:19:13.600]   Yeah.
[00:19:13.600 --> 00:19:17.840]   So do you, Andy, do you think this hurts AT&T or does it help AT&T by taking some of the
[00:19:17.840 --> 00:19:18.840]   pressure?
[00:19:18.840 --> 00:19:19.840]   Exactly.
[00:19:19.840 --> 00:19:22.400]   It definitely, anything that takes, uh, takes them to load off the 3G network is going to
[00:19:22.400 --> 00:19:24.640]   be a positive thing for AT&T.
[00:19:24.640 --> 00:19:29.920]   The things that I'm sort of thinking of are what happens when you just, when, if Apple
[00:19:29.920 --> 00:19:34.160]   were to say that FaceTime is one technology deployed over just by everything they have
[00:19:34.160 --> 00:19:41.960]   from your MacBook to your wife's iPhone for over the office, who's responsible for connecting
[00:19:41.960 --> 00:19:46.680]   me here in the house to that iPhone over there when I'm doing an issue and call via
[00:19:46.680 --> 00:19:47.680]   FaceTime?
[00:19:47.680 --> 00:19:51.480]   Does it have to, if I do, if I initiate that via iChat, will it have, does it have to kick
[00:19:51.480 --> 00:19:58.360]   off as a phone call to that iPhone for or will it start off as over the 3G digital connection
[00:19:58.360 --> 00:20:02.440]   will they'll get some sort of a, the app has a, has a way of like receiving a ping from
[00:20:02.440 --> 00:20:06.960]   iChat saying, by the way, there's an incoming FaceTime call coming through.
[00:20:06.960 --> 00:20:10.800]   And that's all being done through the digital network or something where it's going to require
[00:20:10.800 --> 00:20:16.400]   cooperation from AT&T to make that final leap to the handset actually work.
[00:20:16.400 --> 00:20:19.720]   It doesn't, it doesn't seem, it seems like if you're connected via wifi, it seems like
[00:20:19.720 --> 00:20:23.480]   it would actually, uh, be able to do it, especially when you're looking at this identification
[00:20:23.480 --> 00:20:28.840]   between email or phone by, by identifying them via email, uh, you know, we're basically
[00:20:28.840 --> 00:20:32.880]   saying we're going to reroute that, um, you know, completely outside of the, out of the
[00:20:32.880 --> 00:20:33.880]   network.
[00:20:33.880 --> 00:20:37.720]   And right now this is still all living inside the wifi world, not, not getting, and I have
[00:20:37.720 --> 00:20:42.160]   to admit without unlimited bandwidth, you do not want to be having these calls.
[00:20:42.160 --> 00:20:43.160]   Yeah.
[00:20:43.160 --> 00:20:47.000]   Well, also I think that, that is a consideration that Apple really thinks about what this, what
[00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:51.600]   is the FaceTime experience going to be like if you cannot count on being able to locate
[00:20:51.600 --> 00:20:55.600]   someone on an iPhone from your desktop version of iChat.
[00:20:55.600 --> 00:21:01.320]   And oftentimes like I will be in a place with wifi with my iPhone 4, but you know, I don't
[00:21:01.320 --> 00:21:04.960]   turn on notifications, I don't turn on discovery because it's just annoying to get all these
[00:21:04.960 --> 00:21:05.960]   pop ups.
[00:21:05.960 --> 00:21:09.520]   We discovered net gear, we discovered net gear two, we discovered net gear three, we'd
[00:21:09.520 --> 00:21:13.080]   like to join, we'd like to join net gear four, we'd like to join perks coffee house number
[00:21:13.080 --> 00:21:15.280]   four and you get annoyed.
[00:21:15.280 --> 00:21:18.960]   If it, if there were a way to, it makes it, it sort of raises the question of would it
[00:21:18.960 --> 00:21:23.640]   be, should there be a way to alert the iPhone 4 owner that by the way, someone wants to
[00:21:23.640 --> 00:21:26.880]   talk to you via FaceTime, it is your husband, someone you want to talk to.
[00:21:26.880 --> 00:21:30.680]   If you, if you, if you want to basically tell them to do what you want to suspend the call
[00:21:30.680 --> 00:21:34.320]   for 20 seconds while you establish a wifi connection or do you want to put it through
[00:21:34.320 --> 00:21:39.280]   over 3G, I know the 3G isn't enabled right now, but it's, it's, that's a consideration.
[00:21:39.280 --> 00:21:40.280]   Yeah.
[00:21:40.280 --> 00:21:41.280]   I think it's definitely consideration.
[00:21:41.280 --> 00:21:45.840]   I think that the, you know, right now my Skype, one running in the background, other
[00:21:45.840 --> 00:21:51.280]   than dry, driving my battery into the ground, which is, I can, I think I've noticed that
[00:21:51.280 --> 00:21:56.200]   if I run, if I run Skype, I've gotten to the habit, even when I try to quit it, it doesn't
[00:21:56.200 --> 00:21:58.880]   seem to have a, you know, it doesn't seem to completely quit.
[00:21:58.880 --> 00:21:59.880]   Still there.
[00:21:59.880 --> 00:22:00.880]   It's still there somewhere.
[00:22:00.880 --> 00:22:03.000]   I like, I've learned to like, if I use Skype and I don't, and I really want to keep my
[00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:06.800]   battery, I, I turn my phone off and back on again, because I'm just a little, you know,
[00:22:06.800 --> 00:22:10.840]   because it's been this issue where I've just noticed that my battery draw draws so quickly.
[00:22:10.840 --> 00:22:14.520]   But what I will say is when it's running in the background, anywhere I'm on wifi, people
[00:22:14.520 --> 00:22:18.240]   are contacting me, which is part of the part of what, you know, so, you know, they're
[00:22:18.240 --> 00:22:20.040]   finding me as long as I'm connected to wifi.
[00:22:20.040 --> 00:22:22.800]   And I think that there's a large number of Apple users.
[00:22:22.800 --> 00:22:25.800]   I'm not saying the general population, but there's a large number of people who use
[00:22:25.800 --> 00:22:30.440]   Apple's that are probably spending 80, 90, maybe even 100% of their time connected to
[00:22:30.440 --> 00:22:36.000]   a wifi network of some kind, you know, and I think that that is the real, you know, possible
[00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:37.000]   opportunity.
[00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:40.040]   Now, Don, I have a question for you.
[00:22:40.040 --> 00:22:43.160]   There's a rumor floating around about a seven inch iPad.
[00:22:43.160 --> 00:22:44.160]   What do you think?
[00:22:44.160 --> 00:22:46.040]   I think it's a bit too early.
[00:22:46.040 --> 00:22:47.120]   I think it's a bit too early.
[00:22:47.120 --> 00:22:50.600]   Um, could they still can't shift the, you know, stuff with the shelf quickly enough
[00:22:50.600 --> 00:22:53.720]   as it is now around, no, the other way around, they can't get enough stuff on the shelf
[00:22:53.720 --> 00:22:54.720]   to shift it.
[00:22:54.720 --> 00:22:57.080]   Although if you have a look at the video of the new store that's just been opened in
[00:22:57.080 --> 00:23:01.520]   the UK in, um, Covent Garden, which is, I think is now the biggest Apple store in the
[00:23:01.520 --> 00:23:02.520]   world.
[00:23:02.520 --> 00:23:06.560]   They've got a room just for the iPad and a complete wall full of iPads.
[00:23:06.560 --> 00:23:09.480]   So if anyone's sure as an iPad, they can get down to Covent Garden, if you want it
[00:23:09.480 --> 00:23:10.480]   fairly easily.
[00:23:10.480 --> 00:23:11.960]   But no, the seven inch iPad.
[00:23:11.960 --> 00:23:16.400]   I think I still think it's a bit too, too close to the launch of the original iPad.
[00:23:16.400 --> 00:23:17.640]   I think that needs to bed in first.
[00:23:17.640 --> 00:23:19.960]   Um, so do you think people are fine?
[00:23:19.960 --> 00:23:25.720]   The question is, do you think people would be upset if we, if we jumped into that?
[00:23:25.720 --> 00:23:27.560]   Yeah, possibly, possibly.
[00:23:27.560 --> 00:23:31.760]   Um, but again, you know, it's, it's that, it's that way it formed factor seven inch.
[00:23:31.760 --> 00:23:37.240]   It's sort of a little bit too big for your pocket and not really big enough to do sort
[00:23:37.240 --> 00:23:38.840]   of the thing we've got used to on the iPad.
[00:23:38.840 --> 00:23:42.880]   You know, having all that screen realistic to read and to do things like that.
[00:23:42.880 --> 00:23:46.360]   So I'm not sure whether actually fits in with not seven inch iPad would actually fit
[00:23:46.360 --> 00:23:47.360]   in.
[00:23:47.360 --> 00:23:49.480]   I'm interested to hear what the other thing Andy, what do you think about a seven inch
[00:23:49.480 --> 00:23:50.480]   iPad?
[00:23:50.480 --> 00:23:51.480]   Rubbish.
[00:23:51.480 --> 00:23:53.480]   I don't see any reason for them to build it.
[00:23:53.480 --> 00:23:57.600]   And the, the, the, you start, you start expanding the iPad line when you start to see
[00:23:57.600 --> 00:24:00.240]   a softening in the demand for your existing product.
[00:24:00.240 --> 00:24:04.080]   And like Don said, we're already in a situation where they can't build them fast enough.
[00:24:04.080 --> 00:24:08.400]   So why not why take three ninety nine from people when you can take four ninety nine
[00:24:08.400 --> 00:24:13.840]   and not cheese off the people who bought in early January is this going to, I think then
[00:24:13.840 --> 00:24:17.160]   in January or early February, there's going to be a very interesting event from Apple
[00:24:17.160 --> 00:24:21.360]   as we find out what Apple wants to do for the second iPad.
[00:24:21.360 --> 00:24:25.840]   But I don't think we're going to see anything like a seven inch iPad in the anytime in the
[00:24:25.840 --> 00:24:26.840]   near future.
[00:24:26.840 --> 00:24:29.920]   I'm not even sure if we're going to see one next year.
[00:24:29.920 --> 00:24:34.760]   Apple has to wait and see that Apple has to see any sort of a demand from the public for
[00:24:34.760 --> 00:24:35.760]   a smaller iPad.
[00:24:35.760 --> 00:24:37.000]   And I don't think they're seeing it yet.
[00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:38.000]   Frederick.
[00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:39.000]   Yeah.
[00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:40.000]   So now here's the question.
[00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:41.000]   Yeah.
[00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:45.600]   Is if the, if you, if you had a seven inch and you could charge, let's say not three ninety
[00:24:45.600 --> 00:24:50.640]   nine, but two ninety nine for it with a front facing camera, so on so forth, do you start
[00:24:50.640 --> 00:24:52.560]   to remove all the oxygen?
[00:24:52.560 --> 00:24:58.800]   Now you have almost a hundred dollar increments from ninety nine dollars to eight hundred,
[00:24:58.800 --> 00:25:00.360]   you know, where you're covering the entire market.
[00:25:00.360 --> 00:25:06.560]   There's a little bit of a gap right now between the iPhone and the iPad and does a seven inch
[00:25:06.560 --> 00:25:07.880]   fill that gap in a little bit.
[00:25:07.880 --> 00:25:08.880]   Yeah.
[00:25:08.880 --> 00:25:09.880]   I think you're going back in time.
[00:25:09.880 --> 00:25:13.760]   Remember when Apple had too many products, you know, and it was, it was the case of,
[00:25:13.760 --> 00:25:18.200]   okay, we need to pair it down and to get back to the core competency of what the company
[00:25:18.200 --> 00:25:19.400]   was about.
[00:25:19.400 --> 00:25:22.960]   I think you would be going in that direction again in terms of just, you know, it's too
[00:25:22.960 --> 00:25:23.960]   much stuff out there.
[00:25:23.960 --> 00:25:27.040]   Looking at my sample size of one.
[00:25:27.040 --> 00:25:32.240]   I love my pod, love my phone, but you know, there are still instances where I struggle,
[00:25:32.240 --> 00:25:35.520]   you know, where, why don't I use my MacBook Pro?
[00:25:35.520 --> 00:25:37.000]   You know, why am I using the iPad?
[00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:40.880]   You know, so, and I love the iPad, like I'm in bed with it doing all my stuff and you
[00:25:40.880 --> 00:25:46.440]   know, it's, it's great, but to add another device into the mix, I mean, for me, you know,
[00:25:46.440 --> 00:25:50.440]   to have that constellation of having a fourth device in there or fifth device, if you count
[00:25:50.440 --> 00:25:51.640]   the iMac, does it make sense?
[00:25:51.640 --> 00:25:54.400]   Well, I didn't, but I don't think it's a matter of, even, even other people though,
[00:25:54.400 --> 00:25:57.800]   I mean, if you look at it, if you, if you look, you know, you've got an iPhone, you know,
[00:25:57.800 --> 00:26:00.360]   you have an iPhone for option.
[00:26:00.360 --> 00:26:06.840]   Presumably you'll have a, I, you know, a pod that looks like an iPhone for option.
[00:26:06.840 --> 00:26:13.560]   Now if you add in a seven inch iPad and then the larger iPad in there, why not just go
[00:26:13.560 --> 00:26:16.240]   with one of, you know, the small thing or the big thing?
[00:26:16.240 --> 00:26:18.960]   Well, you know, I can see, I can see my, my own self.
[00:26:18.960 --> 00:26:23.880]   I think it's more of a price issue of people who can't quite jump into $500, but want
[00:26:23.880 --> 00:26:28.240]   something bigger than the, than the, you know, the iPhone or the iTouch, you know, there's
[00:26:28.240 --> 00:26:30.080]   something, and there's a little bit of portability.
[00:26:30.080 --> 00:26:34.160]   And we, you know, Apple has had a history also, if we look into the history books, of
[00:26:34.160 --> 00:26:38.960]   trying to fill that line out so that there's an even gradient from the cheapest thing,
[00:26:38.960 --> 00:26:42.360]   you know, out there, up through, I mean, I think that if we're, you know, like gold
[00:26:42.360 --> 00:26:43.360]   locks, right?
[00:26:43.360 --> 00:26:45.040]   Small, bigger, like, biggest, yeah.
[00:26:45.040 --> 00:26:48.640]   Oh, with the, with the eye, with the iPods, they got to a point where it was $50 up to
[00:26:48.640 --> 00:26:49.640]   $350.
[00:26:49.640 --> 00:26:50.640]   Yeah.
[00:26:50.640 --> 00:26:51.640]   Right.
[00:26:51.640 --> 00:26:55.240]   So I think that was a, with the iPod, I think that was originally just to defend the iTunes
[00:26:55.240 --> 00:26:56.240]   store.
[00:26:56.240 --> 00:26:57.240]   They needed to have a buy.
[00:26:57.240 --> 00:27:02.040]   They needed to have a dirt cheap buy in to, to play protected iTunes content.
[00:27:02.040 --> 00:27:06.480]   I, I prefer to look at how they're pricing the MacBooks, where you, the cheapest MacBook
[00:27:06.480 --> 00:27:13.280]   that they sell as $999 in a field compared to fighting against Windows notebooks in which
[00:27:13.280 --> 00:27:21.080]   even if we leave out the netbooks, the cheapest are 500, 549 and for, for halfway decent notebooks.
[00:27:21.080 --> 00:27:24.960]   So I don't, I don't think they've never been in the cheapest price game.
[00:27:24.960 --> 00:27:30.080]   And I was, and now that Amazon has lowered the bar down to $139 for a book reader that
[00:27:30.080 --> 00:27:33.600]   actually also has an application development kit available for it.
[00:27:33.600 --> 00:27:35.600]   I'm not sure that Apple be interested in getting into that game.
[00:27:35.600 --> 00:27:36.600]   Okay.
[00:27:36.600 --> 00:27:37.600]   And it's still too new.
[00:27:37.600 --> 00:27:38.600]   I mean, the iPad is, it's fresh.
[00:27:38.600 --> 00:27:39.600]   Yeah.
[00:27:39.600 --> 00:27:41.200]   I mean, the box is still on the floor in my office, right?
[00:27:41.200 --> 00:27:44.520]   People are still lined up with 500 bucks in their hands.
[00:27:44.520 --> 00:27:49.160]   I don't think they're going to be apples, kind of be very good at doing that, right?
[00:27:49.160 --> 00:27:51.920]   I mean, at the timing, those things out to make sure that they maximize their returns
[00:27:51.920 --> 00:27:53.600]   before they move on to the next thing.
[00:27:53.600 --> 00:27:54.600]   Right.
[00:27:54.600 --> 00:27:55.600]   Yeah.
[00:27:55.600 --> 00:27:56.600]   Yeah.
[00:27:56.600 --> 00:27:59.520]   I mean, to just to speculate even further, the 7-inch iPad was sort of one of the rumors
[00:27:59.520 --> 00:28:03.560]   for, for the event next week, the proposed event next week and, you know, bringing it
[00:28:03.560 --> 00:28:07.360]   forward and that always leads to speculation of, well, are they making space for another
[00:28:07.360 --> 00:28:10.960]   product in the normal September, October slot when, you know, they would have launched
[00:28:10.960 --> 00:28:14.320]   a new version of the iPad.
[00:28:14.320 --> 00:28:17.960]   But again, it's still too soon for a 7-inch iPad really, you know, even if they, to go
[00:28:17.960 --> 00:28:21.280]   down that route, but we could always speculate on other devices that they might bring out
[00:28:21.280 --> 00:28:22.280]   in the past time.
[00:28:22.280 --> 00:28:25.440]   I was just thinking, I don't think there's going to be a 7-inch iPad, but maybe a 7-inch
[00:28:25.440 --> 00:28:26.440]   iPod touch.
[00:28:26.440 --> 00:28:27.440]   Yeah.
[00:28:27.440 --> 00:28:28.440]   That has teeth.
[00:28:28.440 --> 00:28:29.440]   I'm joking.
[00:28:29.440 --> 00:28:35.320]   Would I want to see, I mean, I want, I want some news on the data center is what I want.
[00:28:35.320 --> 00:28:36.320]   And I want the secret data center.
[00:28:36.320 --> 00:28:37.320]   The secret data center.
[00:28:37.320 --> 00:28:38.720]   And I want my iTunes in the cloud.
[00:28:38.720 --> 00:28:39.720]   I want this.
[00:28:39.720 --> 00:28:41.520]   I want everything to sync and I don't have to worry about it.
[00:28:41.520 --> 00:28:45.760]   That's, that will be the only thing that I know about fiberglass fiberglass fake volcano
[00:28:45.760 --> 00:28:48.760]   that goes over it.
[00:28:48.760 --> 00:28:52.120]   So the helicopter can just, Steve Jobs' gall stream can do a VTOL thing where it just
[00:28:52.120 --> 00:28:55.600]   sort of hovers and just sinks to blow and thunderbirds are go.
[00:28:55.600 --> 00:28:57.800]   I think that's where they, I think that's where they keep the Apple minions.
[00:28:57.800 --> 00:28:58.800]   Yeah.
[00:28:58.800 --> 00:29:03.080]   Now I, I want, I want my iOS for Apple TV around about September, October, time and time for
[00:29:03.080 --> 00:29:04.080]   the holidays.
[00:29:04.080 --> 00:29:05.080]   That, that's what would do me.
[00:29:05.080 --> 00:29:06.080]   Yeah.
[00:29:06.080 --> 00:29:07.080]   That'll be fun.
[00:29:07.080 --> 00:29:08.080]   And Lincoln nicely with the data center for streaming, it's it.
[00:29:08.080 --> 00:29:10.480]   And I just actually want an iTouch because it's not an iTouch.
[00:29:10.480 --> 00:29:11.480]   Of course, it's an iPod touch.
[00:29:11.480 --> 00:29:12.480]   I keep on saying it.
[00:29:12.480 --> 00:29:13.480]   I touch, but iTouch makes way more sense.
[00:29:13.480 --> 00:29:18.280]   It's just easier to say iTouch rather than iPod touch.
[00:29:18.280 --> 00:29:20.280]   I know, I know.
[00:29:20.280 --> 00:29:22.440]   Anyway, so we've got more coming up.
[00:29:22.440 --> 00:29:26.000]   Of course, Apple has, has, has bought the rights to unobtainium.
[00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:27.000]   Unobtanium.
[00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:31.440]   That is, that is, that is, that green lanterns ring is made up.
[00:29:31.440 --> 00:29:32.440]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:29:32.440 --> 00:29:33.440]   Exactly.
[00:29:33.440 --> 00:29:34.440]   So we got that coming up.
[00:29:34.440 --> 00:29:39.080]   But before we get to that, I just want to go, thank one of our sponsors, go to assist
[00:29:39.080 --> 00:29:40.080]   express.
[00:29:40.080 --> 00:29:45.080]   So here's, you know, we've heard of GoToMeeting and GoTo seminar and a lot of us use that
[00:29:45.080 --> 00:29:46.080]   stuff.
[00:29:46.080 --> 00:29:47.840]   A lot of these tools have really revolutionized it.
[00:29:47.840 --> 00:29:52.000]   I was going to go to LA next week and, you know, we were going to, I was going to fly
[00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:55.000]   down and, you know, and all the trouble and everything else.
[00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:57.000]   And we decided, you know what, we're just going to do that online.
[00:29:57.000 --> 00:29:59.200]   You know, we're just going to have that conversation online because it just makes way
[00:29:59.200 --> 00:30:00.200]   more sense.
[00:30:00.200 --> 00:30:02.320]   So this is, this is an extension of that.
[00:30:02.320 --> 00:30:03.320]   Now this is GoToAssist.
[00:30:03.320 --> 00:30:08.280]   And so what, this is really if you're in IT or you're also a software consultant and you
[00:30:08.280 --> 00:30:11.600]   want to look for ways to, you know, to help your clients or help the people that are
[00:30:11.600 --> 00:30:14.720]   in your company without actually going to their desk or going, and we're not talking
[00:30:14.720 --> 00:30:15.720]   about just in the office.
[00:30:15.720 --> 00:30:19.840]   We're talking about, you know, nowadays these, these companies are all over the world.
[00:30:19.840 --> 00:30:23.760]   And so how do you support everyone from a more centralized area where you can have the
[00:30:23.760 --> 00:30:29.200]   best specialists dealing with the individuals need without having to have each one of them
[00:30:29.200 --> 00:30:30.200]   in every office?
[00:30:30.200 --> 00:30:32.000]   And so this is a great solution for it.
[00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:33.000]   Go to assist.
[00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:34.560]   You can, you know, use this to grow your business.
[00:30:34.560 --> 00:30:36.720]   You can be in two places at one time.
[00:30:36.720 --> 00:30:39.040]   You can support customers quickly.
[00:30:39.040 --> 00:30:43.040]   You know, immediately I had another, here's another example where I'm having some trouble
[00:30:43.040 --> 00:30:48.200]   installing some video software and we, you know, the company that I'm working with in
[00:30:48.200 --> 00:30:50.080]   Germany or in, in actually in Austria.
[00:30:50.080 --> 00:30:51.800]   So let's just jump online.
[00:30:51.800 --> 00:30:52.880]   So tomorrow morning at 5 a.m.
[00:30:52.880 --> 00:30:55.800]   I'm going to get up and, you know, it's in there afternoon and we're going to go back
[00:30:55.800 --> 00:30:57.720]   and forth on how to get the stuff all working.
[00:30:57.720 --> 00:31:00.080]   And you know, that's just, it's just the way to make this work.
[00:31:00.080 --> 00:31:04.360]   And so with GoToAssist Express, of course, you can increase your revenue by handling more
[00:31:04.360 --> 00:31:06.360]   support requests if you're a consultant.
[00:31:06.360 --> 00:31:08.520]   You can reduce all your travel time, like I've been talking about.
[00:31:08.520 --> 00:31:12.000]   You can support clients even when they're not on their computer.
[00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:16.160]   This sets up, if you choose to, that you can install stuff, you can move stuff, you can,
[00:31:16.160 --> 00:31:17.360]   you can take over the computer.
[00:31:17.360 --> 00:31:21.840]   You can do all of those things that are necessary to really solve these problems on going only.
[00:31:21.840 --> 00:31:23.280]   If you choose to, of course, there's all the security.
[00:31:23.280 --> 00:31:25.480]   You can decide whether you're going to do that or not.
[00:31:25.480 --> 00:31:26.920]   But it's a great solution there.
[00:31:26.920 --> 00:31:29.920]   And so definitely worth checking out.
[00:31:29.920 --> 00:31:33.040]   And of course, what you want to do if you want to find out more about this is go to
[00:31:33.040 --> 00:31:36.880]   gotoassist.com/macbreak.
[00:31:36.880 --> 00:31:41.040]   And I actually think I even have a little thing here.
[00:31:41.040 --> 00:31:42.040]   Oops.
[00:31:42.040 --> 00:31:45.720]   I work so hard to get it up there.
[00:31:45.720 --> 00:31:46.720]   There it is.
[00:31:46.720 --> 00:31:49.040]   Go toassist.com/macbreak.
[00:31:49.040 --> 00:31:51.400]   And so definitely check this out.
[00:31:51.400 --> 00:31:53.320]   It is, this is the way of the future.
[00:31:53.320 --> 00:31:56.680]   I mean, it is not about, I mean, we're dealing with right now, you know, we're building,
[00:31:56.680 --> 00:32:02.440]   you saw Jerome was here last week and we're doing work with the Rwandan government to
[00:32:02.440 --> 00:32:06.440]   build training and so on and so forth in Rwanda.
[00:32:06.440 --> 00:32:10.800]   And which by the way, congratulations to Paul Kagami who won with a 92% mark.
[00:32:10.800 --> 00:32:13.200]   92% light yesterday.
[00:32:13.200 --> 00:32:20.200]   And the, but the thing is that they, we're not going to be able to be there all the time.
[00:32:20.200 --> 00:32:24.800]   We're not going to, but we can select the best experts to solve their problems with
[00:32:24.800 --> 00:32:29.240]   tools like go toassist every time they have them rather than having to have them all in
[00:32:29.240 --> 00:32:30.240]   country.
[00:32:30.240 --> 00:32:36.400]   And that's, you know, and it's really been made possible because of the fast pace of a bandwidth,
[00:32:36.400 --> 00:32:38.400]   you know, and the ability to actually grab onto this stuff.
[00:32:38.400 --> 00:32:42.480]   I mean, this stuff was, you know, this crazy technology that was barely possible only a
[00:32:42.480 --> 00:32:43.480]   few years ago.
[00:32:43.480 --> 00:32:44.920]   And now it's a common place.
[00:32:44.920 --> 00:32:46.440]   And so check it out.
[00:32:46.440 --> 00:32:50.080]   Once again, go toassist.com/macbreak.
[00:32:50.080 --> 00:32:55.720]   So now we have unobtainium.
[00:32:55.720 --> 00:32:58.880]   That's what I've decided that it should be called because it's, you know, it's very
[00:32:58.880 --> 00:32:59.880]   close to it.
[00:32:59.880 --> 00:33:06.440]   It's centered into an exclusive agreement to utilize amorphous metal alloys, which unique
[00:33:06.440 --> 00:33:11.640]   atomic structures allowing with unique atomic structures, allowing the products to be stronger,
[00:33:11.640 --> 00:33:16.400]   lighter, and resistant to wear and corrosion according to Apple insider.
[00:33:16.400 --> 00:33:19.800]   So Andy, what makes this so special?
[00:33:19.800 --> 00:33:21.520]   I honestly don't know.
[00:33:21.520 --> 00:33:26.760]   I wish I could, I wish I had some insider information or had a better understanding of
[00:33:26.760 --> 00:33:27.960]   what the spritorial is.
[00:33:27.960 --> 00:33:31.880]   And you know that Apple is the most design oriented company, the most materials driven
[00:33:31.880 --> 00:33:33.680]   company in all technology.
[00:33:33.680 --> 00:33:39.800]   They are a company that will look at a block of Milled Tungsten and say, we should design
[00:33:39.800 --> 00:33:43.960]   an entirely new kind of screen around this block of Tungsten.
[00:33:43.960 --> 00:33:46.080]   It will be the first Tungsten screen.
[00:33:46.080 --> 00:33:49.360]   We'll call it something so that people don't think that it's just the filament of a light
[00:33:49.360 --> 00:33:50.360]   bulb.
[00:33:50.360 --> 00:33:52.200]   That is something that's actually important and cool.
[00:33:52.200 --> 00:33:58.680]   I just think that they have, I think they found a way to make things lighter, to make mobile
[00:33:58.680 --> 00:34:04.800]   devices lighter, stronger without having so much of the interior space of the device
[00:34:04.800 --> 00:34:07.360]   given over to structural components.
[00:34:07.360 --> 00:34:11.080]   But other than that, anybody's guess is such an early patent, early piece of information
[00:34:11.080 --> 00:34:13.160]   that we have no idea how this is going to play out.
[00:34:13.160 --> 00:34:16.880]   I mean, in a lot of ways, Apple is always trying to innovate, you know, with the way
[00:34:16.880 --> 00:34:19.560]   that they're building the new laptops, the unibodies and everything else.
[00:34:19.560 --> 00:34:24.640]   So trying to, you know, that pushing along that front edge of that path is a key piece
[00:34:24.640 --> 00:34:28.800]   of how they sell things and how they put stuff together and not just making it the cheapest
[00:34:28.800 --> 00:34:30.280]   but making it the best.
[00:34:30.280 --> 00:34:33.760]   Fred, where do you think this might pop out?
[00:34:33.760 --> 00:34:34.760]   You know, I don't know.
[00:34:34.760 --> 00:34:39.640]   You know, like Andy said, Apple is known for pushing the envelope in terms of materials
[00:34:39.640 --> 00:34:43.240]   to design crazy new cool things out of.
[00:34:43.240 --> 00:34:47.480]   My question is when I first saw the story, I was like, I wonder if this thing can conduct
[00:34:47.480 --> 00:34:53.640]   radio waves, you know, if this new metal, you know, maybe they can create an entire phone
[00:34:53.640 --> 00:34:56.640]   out of this so that we won't have the problem of connecting two pieces.
[00:34:56.640 --> 00:34:57.640]   I don't know.
[00:34:57.640 --> 00:35:00.520]   But, you know, here in Apple, we respect your privacy.
[00:35:00.520 --> 00:35:04.920]   We've developed the only phone that will never accept incoming calls or internet connections.
[00:35:04.920 --> 00:35:06.400]   Your privacy is secure.
[00:35:06.400 --> 00:35:08.160]   Yeah, we've locked it down.
[00:35:08.160 --> 00:35:09.160]   It's a terrible thing.
[00:35:09.160 --> 00:35:11.880]   You, you complain so much, we took the radio away.
[00:35:11.880 --> 00:35:12.880]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:35:12.880 --> 00:35:14.040]   But yeah, I, who knows?
[00:35:14.040 --> 00:35:18.360]   I mean, I'm excited to see what it is, but, you know, it may just turn out to be, hey,
[00:35:18.360 --> 00:35:20.760]   now the phone is three ounces lighter, right?
[00:35:20.760 --> 00:35:22.520]   You know, and no other differences.
[00:35:22.520 --> 00:35:23.520]   Yeah.
[00:35:23.520 --> 00:35:24.520]   Right.
[00:35:24.520 --> 00:35:25.520]   So there's videos.
[00:35:25.520 --> 00:35:26.520]   Go ahead.
[00:35:26.520 --> 00:35:27.520]   Don?
[00:35:27.520 --> 00:35:28.520]   Sorry.
[00:35:28.520 --> 00:35:29.520]   Have you seen the YouTube videos for the liquid metals?
[00:35:29.520 --> 00:35:30.520]   There's some great YouTube videos.
[00:35:30.520 --> 00:35:35.360]   It's basically harder than titanium, but they do a test whereby they get to sort of like
[00:35:35.360 --> 00:35:38.160]   two columns, two glass columns and two ball bearings.
[00:35:38.160 --> 00:35:40.920]   And on one, they have a standard piece of titanium.
[00:35:40.920 --> 00:35:47.000]   And on the other half, they have this liquid metal composite material that's, that's under,
[00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:48.440]   you know, that they've just bought into.
[00:35:48.440 --> 00:35:53.080]   And they drop the two ball bearings and the ball bearing on the titanium bounces for
[00:35:53.080 --> 00:35:55.520]   about 20 seconds, as you might expect.
[00:35:55.520 --> 00:36:01.120]   The, the whole bearing on the liquid metal bounces for a minute and 10 seconds.
[00:36:01.120 --> 00:36:04.720]   It's just unbelievable to actually watch because of the properties, the hardness of
[00:36:04.720 --> 00:36:07.000]   the, of the metal.
[00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:10.360]   It just has this weird property whereby if you drop a ball bearing on it will just bounce
[00:36:10.360 --> 00:36:14.160]   it, you, it looks as though it's never going to slow down and it just stops.
[00:36:14.160 --> 00:36:15.640]   So it's really strange, but check it.
[00:36:15.640 --> 00:36:17.240]   Check out the videos on YouTube to see what it does.
[00:36:17.240 --> 00:36:19.720]   Now, what they're going to actually use it for, I'm sure they're not thinking of in
[00:36:19.720 --> 00:36:21.960]   compromising bouncing ball bearings in any of the machine.
[00:36:21.960 --> 00:36:24.560]   But yeah, it's probably just the hardness of the actual metal as well.
[00:36:24.560 --> 00:36:26.000]   I think they've used it in the past.
[00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:30.080]   The company has used it for things like super efficient and super hard wearing hinges and
[00:36:30.080 --> 00:36:31.080]   things like that.
[00:36:31.080 --> 00:36:32.080]   Right.
[00:36:32.080 --> 00:36:35.680]   It seems like it's a great additive for the iPods and it touches and everything else.
[00:36:35.680 --> 00:36:42.400]   Interestingly, Frederick, do you think any Navi were injured in the creation and mining
[00:36:42.400 --> 00:36:44.920]   of this liquid metal?
[00:36:44.920 --> 00:36:45.920]   I hope not.
[00:36:45.920 --> 00:36:48.880]   I, you know, I think that that would be yet another, you know, you have the antenna problems
[00:36:48.880 --> 00:36:53.280]   and then we have, you know, tribal problems on other planets.
[00:36:53.280 --> 00:36:55.040]   Hopefully Apple can avoid this.
[00:36:55.040 --> 00:36:56.040]   Yes.
[00:36:56.040 --> 00:36:57.040]   Yeah.
[00:36:57.040 --> 00:36:58.040]   You know, I think we saw it.
[00:36:58.040 --> 00:37:01.760]   I hope we don't equate Apple to the, to the hoarding corporation that goes and deforest
[00:37:01.760 --> 00:37:02.760]   the new world.
[00:37:02.760 --> 00:37:03.760]   Hopefully.
[00:37:03.760 --> 00:37:08.820]   Not only we can only hope that Apple has avoided this after seeing a word of warning from James
[00:37:08.820 --> 00:37:09.820]   Cameron.
[00:37:09.820 --> 00:37:11.520]   So anyway, I'll also come in the news here.
[00:37:11.520 --> 00:37:12.520]   Okay.
[00:37:12.520 --> 00:37:13.520]   Here it comes.
[00:37:13.520 --> 00:37:17.320]   This comes up every so often we have to keep on talking about it a little bit.
[00:37:17.320 --> 00:37:24.040]   AT&T warns exclusivity for a quote unquote, a number of attractive handsets will end.
[00:37:24.040 --> 00:37:26.160]   This is according to Apple Insider.
[00:37:26.160 --> 00:37:31.040]   In its latest filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, AT&T has made mention
[00:37:31.040 --> 00:37:36.280]   of the its exclusivity agreements for smartphones and attempted to argue that the company would
[00:37:36.280 --> 00:37:38.560]   remain strong after those expire.
[00:37:38.560 --> 00:37:44.240]   Though Apple's iPhone was not, of course, specifically named is it?
[00:37:44.240 --> 00:37:51.040]   Do we think Andy that the end is is near for the Apple AT&T relationship?
[00:37:51.040 --> 00:37:52.360]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:37:52.360 --> 00:37:59.160]   I'm skeptical of any new iPhone and new carrier rumors only because we've heard so often.
[00:37:59.160 --> 00:38:04.800]   But you know that Apple did not give AT&T unlimited open ended exclusivity and every
[00:38:04.800 --> 00:38:10.720]   year that passes without any sort of announcement that that secret agreement is now invalid puts
[00:38:10.720 --> 00:38:11.720]   us.
[00:38:11.720 --> 00:38:13.680]   I think I know that you're closer to the year when we are going to hear that announcement
[00:38:13.680 --> 00:38:15.600]   that that announcement is invalid.
[00:38:15.600 --> 00:38:21.240]   That's very when you when you see something that the company is willing to admit to stockholders,
[00:38:21.240 --> 00:38:24.560]   that has to be that has to really get your attention because that's something that's so
[00:38:24.560 --> 00:38:29.120]   important that they can get sued and prosecuted if they don't actually say the sort of thing
[00:38:29.120 --> 00:38:30.120]   at a time.
[00:38:30.120 --> 00:38:35.560]   And I'm sure they're not talking about the Nokia N30 handset with the illuminated keypad
[00:38:35.560 --> 00:38:37.160]   and the three lines of LCD.
[00:38:37.160 --> 00:38:39.600]   I'm sure they're talking about the iPhone and stuff like that.
[00:38:39.600 --> 00:38:42.200]   Well, and this is one of the things that I was at an Apple store.
[00:38:42.200 --> 00:38:43.920]   I mean, Apple store and AT&T store.
[00:38:43.920 --> 00:38:46.680]   That's where I actually bought my my kids, their iPhones.
[00:38:46.680 --> 00:38:49.080]   And of course I asked I said, so what do people buy here?
[00:38:49.080 --> 00:38:53.520]   I mean, you have all all the POP like so all the stuff on it on the store, all the posters,
[00:38:53.520 --> 00:38:54.520]   everything else or nothing.
[00:38:54.520 --> 00:38:58.120]   There's like no, no iPhone anywhere in the AT&T store.
[00:38:58.120 --> 00:39:01.000]   But you ask someone, what do people buy here and they're like iPhones.
[00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:06.320]   So does this, Fredrick, does this hurt AT&T in some ways?
[00:39:06.320 --> 00:39:10.880]   Does it help it by taking some of the pressure or some of the load off of their network?
[00:39:10.880 --> 00:39:13.280]   You know, I would have to say it's going to hurt.
[00:39:13.280 --> 00:39:15.360]   I mean, you're losing cash cow, right?
[00:39:15.360 --> 00:39:19.680]   I mean, in people, every person, most people that I talk to, not every person, but most
[00:39:19.680 --> 00:39:24.240]   people that I talk to, my brother included who incessantly rancid he's not buying an
[00:39:24.240 --> 00:39:27.720]   iPhone for until it goes to Verizon.
[00:39:27.720 --> 00:39:29.120]   And I am not using it.
[00:39:29.120 --> 00:39:34.120]   You should see the text messages and sends me ranting about the whole thing.
[00:39:34.120 --> 00:39:36.640]   But it's, you know, who knows?
[00:39:36.640 --> 00:39:41.840]   I mean, I think it ultimately will hurt them because now people will have choice, but for
[00:39:41.840 --> 00:39:43.320]   us consumers, it's good.
[00:39:43.320 --> 00:39:45.200]   You know, it will spur on competition.
[00:39:45.200 --> 00:39:51.040]   John, do you think that AT&T's reputation has been permanently damaged by this entire
[00:39:51.040 --> 00:39:52.040]   process?
[00:39:52.040 --> 00:39:53.240]   Yeah, I think so.
[00:39:53.240 --> 00:39:57.440]   I mean, obviously not being in the US, we hear an awful lot about AT&T.
[00:39:57.440 --> 00:40:01.400]   And of course, I have to remind everyone that outside of the US, we're fortunate to have
[00:40:01.400 --> 00:40:04.760]   multiple characters, carriers over here, that support the iPhone.
[00:40:04.760 --> 00:40:09.640]   In fact, this time around, it was a real pleasure to go to the Apple Store, buy an iPhone 4
[00:40:09.640 --> 00:40:12.400]   and then have my choice of carriers, you know, to go with.
[00:40:12.400 --> 00:40:13.640]   So I could actually buy.
[00:40:13.640 --> 00:40:16.440]   So I'm not tied into a contract now as far as the phone is concerned.
[00:40:16.440 --> 00:40:19.640]   I just, you know, when the next phone comes out, I can actually just chop and change quite
[00:40:19.640 --> 00:40:20.640]   easily.
[00:40:20.640 --> 00:40:24.640]   But yeah, I mean, the overall impression that we get, sort of looking in from the outside
[00:40:24.640 --> 00:40:29.840]   is that, you know, AT&T have a horrendous reputation.
[00:40:29.840 --> 00:40:32.680]   But it seems to be, you know, in the areas where it really hurts them as well.
[00:40:32.680 --> 00:40:37.520]   So around Silicon Valley and San Francisco places like that, where, you know, it's the
[00:40:37.520 --> 00:40:41.680]   most vocal people seem to be, the most technically savvy people seem to be there, they're having
[00:40:41.680 --> 00:40:44.080]   problems with their connectivity and their network.
[00:40:44.080 --> 00:40:47.000]   So unfortunately, yeah, it's, I think it has done a lot of damage.
[00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:51.240]   And I think that if the phone just goes way to multiple carriers, it is going to hurt
[00:40:51.240 --> 00:40:52.240]   them anyway.
[00:40:52.240 --> 00:40:55.960]   Andy, do you think that AT&T can recover from this as the iPhone starts to move away
[00:40:55.960 --> 00:40:56.960]   from them?
[00:40:56.960 --> 00:41:00.560]   I mean, because it's not just the overall view of AT&T has changed.
[00:41:00.560 --> 00:41:05.200]   It has been affected completely by its inability to kind of handle these issues and oftentimes
[00:41:05.200 --> 00:41:07.200]   handle the PR.
[00:41:07.200 --> 00:41:11.440]   I don't think it's, I think the bad news is that they're going to lose all those exclusive
[00:41:11.440 --> 00:41:13.520]   iPhone contracts.
[00:41:13.520 --> 00:41:16.280]   I think that most of the people, most of the people who are buying iPhones these days
[00:41:16.280 --> 00:41:18.440]   are going to the Apple Store, not the AT&T store.
[00:41:18.440 --> 00:41:20.360]   It's the contracts that are really going to hurt.
[00:41:20.360 --> 00:41:24.320]   In terms of their public relations, I don't think that's really going to be any, any ding
[00:41:24.320 --> 00:41:29.000]   whatsoever, because if anything, they'll spend the next year building up statistics saying
[00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:33.120]   that, well, now that we're not, if you're not using an iPhone, our network works great.
[00:41:33.120 --> 00:41:36.920]   I don't know what it is about this iPhone, the key that screws up other people's networks,
[00:41:36.920 --> 00:41:38.520]   but our network is just fine.
[00:41:38.520 --> 00:41:42.320]   But they'll still have all the statistics, all the statistics they want to cite about
[00:41:42.320 --> 00:41:45.800]   the performance and the speed of their 3G network and how good they are deploying other
[00:41:45.800 --> 00:41:47.720]   phones other than the iPhone.
[00:41:47.720 --> 00:41:53.960]   By the way, I've actually learned that the tethering my iPhone would be, I haven't done
[00:41:53.960 --> 00:41:57.800]   it yet, would be cheaper than my MIFI.
[00:41:57.800 --> 00:42:01.000]   You know, it's $30 and then it's $10 a gig.
[00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:05.240]   So doing it the legal way, not using the jailbreak.me.
[00:42:05.240 --> 00:42:06.240]   Right.
[00:42:06.240 --> 00:42:11.760]   No, I'm talking about the legal process or the non-jailbroken version.
[00:42:11.760 --> 00:42:15.160]   Something to calculate, just in case you're wondering, just something I found out, is
[00:42:15.160 --> 00:42:21.800]   that if you go over the 5GIG limit for MIFI, it's a little bit more expensive than $10
[00:42:21.800 --> 00:42:22.960]   a gig.
[00:42:22.960 --> 00:42:24.640]   It's $50 a gig.
[00:42:24.640 --> 00:42:28.360]   And let me tell you how much it costs if you accidentally upload, someone in your production
[00:42:28.360 --> 00:42:32.280]   team is using it and accidentally uploads 12 gigs of data.
[00:42:32.280 --> 00:42:34.120]   So it's a big deal.
[00:42:34.120 --> 00:42:35.120]   How much?
[00:42:35.120 --> 00:42:36.120]   What's the number?
[00:42:36.120 --> 00:42:37.120]   $600.
[00:42:37.120 --> 00:42:38.120]   $600.
[00:42:38.120 --> 00:42:39.560]   So it makes us sad.
[00:42:39.560 --> 00:42:40.560]   So it makes us sad.
[00:42:40.560 --> 00:42:41.560]   But that's, you know, it is.
[00:42:41.560 --> 00:42:42.560]   It's your fire.
[00:42:42.560 --> 00:42:43.560]   My fire.
[00:42:43.560 --> 00:42:45.040]   The big question is, the big question is how did you edit your iPhone?
[00:42:45.040 --> 00:42:47.720]   You invoice that to the client.
[00:42:47.720 --> 00:42:49.480]   It's sprinted out.
[00:42:49.480 --> 00:42:51.280]   HDMI, SIM, DM, DL.
[00:42:51.280 --> 00:42:53.040]   Yeah, no conversion.
[00:42:53.040 --> 00:42:54.040]   No comment.
[00:42:54.040 --> 00:42:57.000]   No, that was, that was, it came out of the margin.
[00:42:57.000 --> 00:43:00.920]   It didn't, you know, it just, the price was the same.
[00:43:00.920 --> 00:43:03.760]   We just made a lot less.
[00:43:03.760 --> 00:43:07.400]   So it, you know, so, but it's a, it was a sad, sad thing.
[00:43:07.400 --> 00:43:08.400]   So anyway, thank you.
[00:43:08.400 --> 00:43:10.240]   I will let it out by your mistakes.
[00:43:10.240 --> 00:43:11.240]   Yeah.
[00:43:11.240 --> 00:43:13.840]   So, you know, if you have a MIFI, take that into account.
[00:43:13.840 --> 00:43:19.920]   And so anyway, also we have in this mix of all of the stuff happening with AT&T, of
[00:43:19.920 --> 00:43:24.120]   course, the other issue that we have is that the Verizon phone looks like it's becoming
[00:43:24.120 --> 00:43:25.160]   more and more real.
[00:43:25.160 --> 00:43:30.320]   So there are rumors, and this is according to electronic, electronic, that Apple is
[00:43:30.320 --> 00:43:36.160]   edging closer to the Verizon phone in January with large orders of CDMA chipsets, insider
[00:43:36.160 --> 00:43:41.600]   it reportedly said on Sunday, the company is queuing up quote unquote, millions of Qualcomm
[00:43:41.600 --> 00:43:46.280]   chipsets for production, for a production run that starts in December.
[00:43:46.280 --> 00:43:49.680]   The requests are coming, are coming in early.
[00:43:49.680 --> 00:43:54.160]   TechCrunch said as lead, as lead times for the chips often require months to generate
[00:43:54.160 --> 00:43:57.920]   enough supply, even when other components can be made more quickly.
[00:43:57.920 --> 00:44:03.600]   So A are the rumors real, but also one of the questions that I have for you Andy actually
[00:44:03.600 --> 00:44:09.520]   is why not use Qualcomm actually makes a chip that's GSM and CDMA?
[00:44:09.520 --> 00:44:11.720]   Why wouldn't Apple just use and we don't know what chips?
[00:44:11.720 --> 00:44:13.400]   All we know is they're ordering lots of chips.
[00:44:13.400 --> 00:44:17.040]   Wouldn't it make sense for Apple to just use a hybrid chip?
[00:44:17.040 --> 00:44:19.880]   That's the same question that I've been asking over the past couple of weeks.
[00:44:19.880 --> 00:44:24.440]   As a matter of fact, as soon as I started looking at the specs for that Qualcomm chip,
[00:44:24.440 --> 00:44:25.680]   I thought, there you go.
[00:44:25.680 --> 00:44:30.120]   That's exactly, I bet this was made to order or at least made in anticipation for future
[00:44:30.120 --> 00:44:35.080]   market as Verizon becomes pretty much the de facto network for the United States of America,
[00:44:35.080 --> 00:44:38.120]   or at least the non-iPhone, the United States of America.
[00:44:38.120 --> 00:44:44.880]   I could only think that there's a power requirement that Apple doesn't like or there's some other
[00:44:44.880 --> 00:44:48.760]   cost to the chip, maybe even just the cost of the chip they don't like.
[00:44:48.760 --> 00:44:51.080]   The third reason could be just simple strategy.
[00:44:51.080 --> 00:44:54.200]   Why would they build one phone that?
[00:44:54.200 --> 00:44:58.280]   One sure way of carrying or locking your phone is to give it one sort of radio chip set that
[00:44:58.280 --> 00:45:01.920]   cannot be used with any other network in the United States of America.
[00:45:01.920 --> 00:45:04.880]   It's possible that they're thinking with the amount of phones that we're going to sell
[00:45:04.880 --> 00:45:11.200]   through Verizon, why would we spend an extra penny and a half per part to make it easier
[00:45:11.200 --> 00:45:14.560]   for people to buy this phone and use it on another network?
[00:45:14.560 --> 00:45:18.280]   It's interesting as EVDO is actually in a bunch of countries.
[00:45:18.280 --> 00:45:22.400]   I use the CDMA network in Brazil.
[00:45:22.400 --> 00:45:26.920]   It's available in, I think, I want to say 60 to 80 countries, a lot of the major ones.
[00:45:26.920 --> 00:45:31.440]   It's been slowly rolling out because of Verizon's success in some ways, because it's something
[00:45:31.440 --> 00:45:36.080]   that is, for the same number of cell towers, you get a lot more coverage.
[00:45:36.080 --> 00:45:38.400]   That's why Verizon has such a good network.
[00:45:38.400 --> 00:45:43.000]   I was going to say for the CDMA GSM phone, that would be a super phone.
[00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:46.680]   It would be the one, I mean, that would make it something that you could use in any country,
[00:45:46.680 --> 00:45:48.640]   in any process.
[00:45:48.640 --> 00:45:51.880]   You could theoretically switch to whichever one made the most sense in that country, even
[00:45:51.880 --> 00:45:52.880]   if they were both available.
[00:45:52.880 --> 00:45:58.120]   I think I think I think I'm in the whole idea of what I was thinking as I was in the grocery
[00:45:58.120 --> 00:46:01.920]   store the other day, is you can use those racks of go phones and all those.
[00:46:01.920 --> 00:46:03.240]   Those are CDMA, right?
[00:46:03.240 --> 00:46:11.160]   So what if Apple decided to create a really cheap version of an iPhone that you can buy
[00:46:11.160 --> 00:46:12.160]   off the rack?
[00:46:12.160 --> 00:46:13.160]   It seems unlikely.
[00:46:13.160 --> 00:46:16.240]   It seems unlikely, but it's a pair that's more soluble.
[00:46:16.240 --> 00:46:17.240]   Ten million.
[00:46:17.240 --> 00:46:19.760]   Ten million, remember, they got a ten million number that they...
[00:46:19.760 --> 00:46:23.480]   I just don't think that all they have to do is get the ten million is to turn the iMacs
[00:46:23.480 --> 00:46:24.480]   on.
[00:46:24.480 --> 00:46:26.800]   You know, like all the FaceTime devices?
[00:46:26.800 --> 00:46:29.280]   That's an easy number to get to.
[00:46:29.280 --> 00:46:31.600]   The device is something you hold, though.
[00:46:31.600 --> 00:46:32.600]   Appliance.
[00:46:32.600 --> 00:46:36.160]   Don, do you want CDMA on your iPhone?
[00:46:36.160 --> 00:46:37.160]   Not really.
[00:46:37.160 --> 00:46:40.360]   When you get in the UK, you would, you know, GSM, Prisma.
[00:46:40.360 --> 00:46:44.480]   I think Orange might have some CDMA, but predominantly it's GSM.
[00:46:44.480 --> 00:46:48.840]   Whenever I travel abroad, whenever I come to the States, you know, I always use that AT&T
[00:46:48.840 --> 00:46:49.840]   service over there.
[00:46:49.840 --> 00:46:53.240]   So there's no real need for us over here to go down that route.
[00:46:53.240 --> 00:46:57.600]   It's not really a barrier for Apple to sell as many iPhones as they can, because again,
[00:46:57.600 --> 00:46:59.200]   we're not limited just to single provider.
[00:46:59.200 --> 00:47:05.040]   All the providers that have now got the iPhone, you know, just GSM providers.
[00:47:05.040 --> 00:47:06.600]   So it's not an issue for us.
[00:47:06.600 --> 00:47:08.600]   Andy, you were saying before?
[00:47:08.600 --> 00:47:11.640]   No, all I was saying is that...
[00:47:11.640 --> 00:47:13.640]   Goodness, I'm sorry.
[00:47:13.640 --> 00:47:17.640]   I was listening so carefully where other people were saying that I sort of disconnected
[00:47:17.640 --> 00:47:20.480]   from the rest of my comment.
[00:47:20.480 --> 00:47:23.640]   Basically, all I was saying is that...
[00:47:23.640 --> 00:47:25.640]   I forget it.
[00:47:25.640 --> 00:47:26.640]   I can't.
[00:47:26.640 --> 00:47:28.640]   See, I think it's awesome.
[00:47:28.640 --> 00:47:33.080]   You're on a show with people who are like saying interesting things, so like, "Wow,
[00:47:33.080 --> 00:47:34.080]   goodness, that is a good point."
[00:47:34.080 --> 00:47:35.080]   I wonder, like, "Oh, wait, what?"
[00:47:35.080 --> 00:47:36.080]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:47:36.080 --> 00:47:40.200]   And then of course I just zing it over to Andy as I prepare.
[00:47:40.200 --> 00:47:44.640]   As I still propose, of course, so what happened was I needed another couple of seconds to
[00:47:44.640 --> 00:47:49.360]   make sure that I was ready to thank another one of our sponsors, which is Drobo.
[00:47:49.360 --> 00:47:51.360]   So, of course, we want to...
[00:47:51.360 --> 00:47:54.000]   It's cozy underneath this bus.
[00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:58.720]   So, of course, we want to thank Drobo.
[00:47:58.720 --> 00:48:04.720]   Drobo.com/MacBreak is where you can go to get your savings.
[00:48:04.720 --> 00:48:07.920]   And there's a lot of good savings depending on what you're buying.
[00:48:07.920 --> 00:48:10.640]   So I'm a heavy user of Drobo.
[00:48:10.640 --> 00:48:11.960]   Frederick has some history with Drobo.
[00:48:11.960 --> 00:48:12.960]   I do.
[00:48:12.960 --> 00:48:13.960]   I used to work there.
[00:48:13.960 --> 00:48:14.960]   I used to hook their products.
[00:48:14.960 --> 00:48:15.960]   You sound like their products.
[00:48:15.960 --> 00:48:17.120]   And I still own their products.
[00:48:17.120 --> 00:48:18.360]   I own a lot of their products.
[00:48:18.360 --> 00:48:19.360]   So we have...
[00:48:19.360 --> 00:48:21.360]   I have a couple of Drobo's at the house, a couple of Drobo's at the office.
[00:48:21.360 --> 00:48:22.520]   We keep a lot of our...
[00:48:22.520 --> 00:48:25.840]   A lot of the important data that we need to come back to all the time, we're keeping it
[00:48:25.840 --> 00:48:27.640]   on a Drobo because it's simple.
[00:48:27.640 --> 00:48:28.640]   You know, I don't have to think about it.
[00:48:28.640 --> 00:48:31.240]   Of course, smaller files, you can throw on the cloud and that makes a lot of sense.
[00:48:31.240 --> 00:48:35.520]   And a lot of people have heard me say that if it's not in two places or three, which I've
[00:48:35.520 --> 00:48:36.520]   quoted many, many times...
[00:48:36.520 --> 00:48:37.520]   Doesn't exist.
[00:48:37.520 --> 00:48:41.200]   You know, a slogan that I was trying to push through that never got approved was, "I use
[00:48:41.200 --> 00:48:42.960]   a Drobo because I'm lazy."
[00:48:42.960 --> 00:48:46.040]   I mean, my data to be available.
[00:48:46.040 --> 00:48:47.200]   I don't want to work for it.
[00:48:47.200 --> 00:48:49.840]   Well, and I don't want to think about raid five.
[00:48:49.840 --> 00:48:51.240]   For a lot of people, you don't want to think about raid five.
[00:48:51.240 --> 00:48:52.480]   You don't want to think about matching the drives.
[00:48:52.480 --> 00:48:55.440]   You don't want to think about having to rematch the drives if you want to make a bigger.
[00:48:55.440 --> 00:48:56.440]   You don't want to think about all those things.
[00:48:56.440 --> 00:49:00.120]   You just want it to be backed up and know that if one of the drives goes down, it's
[00:49:00.120 --> 00:49:01.720]   going to be still there.
[00:49:01.720 --> 00:49:05.400]   And so, you know, that's why we've been using the Drobo's for so long and they're just,
[00:49:05.400 --> 00:49:06.840]   you know, tried and true for us.
[00:49:06.840 --> 00:49:07.840]   You know, we're very...
[00:49:07.840 --> 00:49:11.520]   We have one of the bigger Drobo's and the Drobo leap down in the office.
[00:49:11.520 --> 00:49:13.360]   And we have five iMacs hooked up to it.
[00:49:13.360 --> 00:49:15.720]   We're editing from this Drobo.
[00:49:15.720 --> 00:49:17.240]   Five computers all hooked into it.
[00:49:17.240 --> 00:49:23.920]   It's got a SCSI Ethernet, which, you know, when people came to talk to me about the SCSI
[00:49:23.920 --> 00:49:25.720]   Ethernet, I was like, "Maybe that's going to work."
[00:49:25.720 --> 00:49:26.720]   You know, I don't really know.
[00:49:26.720 --> 00:49:27.920]   SCSI is a bad taste in your mouth.
[00:49:27.920 --> 00:49:28.920]   Well, no, I just...
[00:49:28.920 --> 00:49:31.840]   I don't know if it's going to be fast enough to put a bunch of machines on it too.
[00:49:31.840 --> 00:49:35.920]   And it turns out that we're editing HD video off of it and it's just cranking away.
[00:49:35.920 --> 00:49:39.000]   And so, we're looking at actually investing in another one for other parts of production
[00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:41.640]   because this seems to work for what we need.
[00:49:41.640 --> 00:49:43.560]   And so anyway, so it's great.
[00:49:43.560 --> 00:49:45.200]   Of course, you have the original Drobo.
[00:49:45.200 --> 00:49:46.200]   That's what I have a lot of.
[00:49:46.200 --> 00:49:50.160]   You have the Drobo S, which I just need to say that I was the first one in the world
[00:49:50.160 --> 00:49:51.160]   to buy.
[00:49:51.160 --> 00:49:52.160]   You were.
[00:49:52.160 --> 00:49:55.000]   And then the Drobo Pro, which is fantastic.
[00:49:55.000 --> 00:49:59.960]   It's got eight days that you can have up to now, I guess, shoot.
[00:49:59.960 --> 00:50:03.520]   It's like up to 16 terabytes of data.
[00:50:03.520 --> 00:50:04.840]   So there's a lot of data there.
[00:50:04.840 --> 00:50:05.840]   You can get there.
[00:50:05.840 --> 00:50:06.840]   Of course, you can put it up.
[00:50:06.840 --> 00:50:14.600]   And the thing is, if you have a big IT staff and you want to build up these huge raids,
[00:50:14.600 --> 00:50:18.480]   it still makes sense in some areas if you want super fast speed with fiber connections
[00:50:18.480 --> 00:50:19.480]   and all this stuff.
[00:50:19.480 --> 00:50:21.480]   But most people out there don't need that.
[00:50:21.480 --> 00:50:23.960]   You might be sold that, but you don't need that.
[00:50:23.960 --> 00:50:27.040]   What you need is something that just keeps all your data fairly safe.
[00:50:27.040 --> 00:50:30.600]   Now, really to keep it safe, what you want is a Drobo in one place and a Drobo somewhere
[00:50:30.600 --> 00:50:33.360]   else because it doesn't protect you from fire and everything else.
[00:50:33.360 --> 00:50:35.680]   But you're not going to worry about your drive going down.
[00:50:35.680 --> 00:50:37.160]   So definitely check it out.
[00:50:37.160 --> 00:50:38.960]   There are great, twit prices.
[00:50:38.960 --> 00:50:40.680]   So these are great prices that you can get.
[00:50:40.680 --> 00:50:45.920]   So you can save as little as $75 if you're buying a Drobo.
[00:50:45.920 --> 00:50:50.720]   And as much as $1,200 if you're getting two Drobo Pros or $500 if you're doing a Drobo
[00:50:50.720 --> 00:50:56.240]   Elite, all you have to do is go to Drobo.com/Macbreak.
[00:50:56.240 --> 00:50:57.920]   So definitely go check that out.
[00:50:57.920 --> 00:50:58.920]   Check out the prices.
[00:50:58.920 --> 00:51:00.400]   Check out what they've got there.
[00:51:00.400 --> 00:51:03.760]   It's really a great solution to make all of those stuff.
[00:51:03.760 --> 00:51:06.960]   Alex, I touched on the Drobo in this week's show for Screencast Online.
[00:51:06.960 --> 00:51:11.720]   I was looking at the Pogo plug, which is the personal cloud storage device that you plug
[00:51:11.720 --> 00:51:14.760]   into your own network and then you can access all your data from the web.
[00:51:14.760 --> 00:51:19.200]   And one of the seconds on the show this week actually included plugging a Drobo into the
[00:51:19.200 --> 00:51:21.040]   USB port on the Pogo plug.
[00:51:21.040 --> 00:51:24.360]   So you can sort of immediately, if you've got two or three terabytes of data on your
[00:51:24.360 --> 00:51:27.960]   Drobo, you plug into the Pogo plug and then you can access all that data across the web.
[00:51:27.960 --> 00:51:31.600]   It's a really neat solution if someone doesn't want to go to a standard cloud-based solution.
[00:51:31.600 --> 00:51:33.880]   Right, they want to put lots of information on the web.
[00:51:33.880 --> 00:51:35.600]   They can just plug a Drobo straight into a Pogo plug.
[00:51:35.600 --> 00:51:39.760]   And the thing is that I will say that I'm a big fan of storing a lot of data on the cloud,
[00:51:39.760 --> 00:51:43.000]   except when I put it up there on a MIFI.
[00:51:43.000 --> 00:51:47.320]   But I think that it becomes a really expensive storage solution.
[00:51:47.320 --> 00:51:51.320]   But it makes sense to have it on the cloud and really to me the thing that makes the
[00:51:51.320 --> 00:51:53.280]   most sense for the data that's the most important.
[00:51:53.280 --> 00:51:57.520]   And when I say the data that's most important, your company records, your family photos,
[00:51:57.520 --> 00:52:01.400]   your family information, all these things that your family home videos, all these things
[00:52:01.400 --> 00:52:04.520]   that would really hurt if you lost.
[00:52:04.520 --> 00:52:07.520]   Having it one place in the cloud and one place on a Drobo.
[00:52:07.520 --> 00:52:12.240]   If you have it in those two places, if you lose the data at that point, you're going
[00:52:12.240 --> 00:52:15.120]   to be worried about other things other than your data.
[00:52:15.120 --> 00:52:18.760]   You're going to be worried about the fact that we're not going to see the sun for the
[00:52:18.760 --> 00:52:19.760]   next 100 years.
[00:52:19.760 --> 00:52:24.520]   Yeah, one of the main issues that folks hit when you're dealing with large amounts of
[00:52:24.520 --> 00:52:29.120]   data, and I talk to photographers all the time because this we can photo.
[00:52:29.120 --> 00:52:33.160]   But it's, yeah, you want to have it in the cloud, but you're on this treadmill that's
[00:52:33.160 --> 00:52:36.800]   running faster than you are in terms of your shooting.
[00:52:36.800 --> 00:52:42.040]   So your wedding photographers shooting gigabytes of data every weekend and trying to pump that
[00:52:42.040 --> 00:52:44.840]   up to the cloud to protect it up there and then mirror it over here.
[00:52:44.840 --> 00:52:47.080]   And then it just gets out of hand and you don't do it.
[00:52:47.080 --> 00:52:51.520]   But what Don was saying in terms of using a Pogo plug, you could potentially circumvent
[00:52:51.520 --> 00:52:53.760]   that because it's local as well.
[00:52:53.760 --> 00:52:57.000]   And you copy it on there and then it's in the cloud and accessible and you can have multiple
[00:52:57.000 --> 00:52:58.480]   locations and all that.
[00:52:58.480 --> 00:53:00.640]   So yeah, I think that's a really good solution.
[00:53:00.640 --> 00:53:01.720]   I'm going to look into that Don.
[00:53:01.720 --> 00:53:02.720]   That's cool.
[00:53:02.720 --> 00:53:03.720]   Fantastic.
[00:53:03.720 --> 00:53:07.840]   So moving on, we have some interesting timing.
[00:53:07.840 --> 00:53:10.600]   Microsoft, this is according to Apple Insider.
[00:53:10.600 --> 00:53:16.360]   Microsoft is attempting to discourage PC users from switching to the Mac oddly enough.
[00:53:16.360 --> 00:53:21.520]   Microsoft has launched a new website that tells PC users that they have Blu-ray.
[00:53:21.520 --> 00:53:23.200]   They have more software choices.
[00:53:23.200 --> 00:53:27.920]   They have a greater array of hardware options when compared to Apple's Mac platform.
[00:53:27.920 --> 00:53:30.120]   Andy, what's your take on this?
[00:53:30.120 --> 00:53:34.720]   Yeah, well, part of it is just the timing is not mysterious because July and August
[00:53:34.720 --> 00:53:36.960]   are the months when they sell lots of laptops.
[00:53:36.960 --> 00:53:43.680]   It's also not, it's not surprise that they're concerned about how well Apple does to selling
[00:53:43.680 --> 00:53:46.200]   computers to people in college and people in high school.
[00:53:46.200 --> 00:53:48.720]   They just sort of own that market.
[00:53:48.720 --> 00:53:53.880]   But I've got their site in front of me and there's a mixture of really great points that
[00:53:53.880 --> 00:54:00.320]   Apple could never really fight against, which is the versatility, the genetic diversity
[00:54:00.320 --> 00:54:02.720]   of Windows machines that are out there.
[00:54:02.720 --> 00:54:07.160]   And if there's one thing I've always really sort of envied about the Windows marketplace,
[00:54:07.160 --> 00:54:10.840]   it's that no matter what sort of computer you have in your mind, you can find it out
[00:54:10.840 --> 00:54:11.840]   there somewhere.
[00:54:11.840 --> 00:54:16.120]   Whatever size, whatever speed, whatever features, whatever form factor, it's out there.
[00:54:16.120 --> 00:54:21.040]   You can go get it as opposed to doing what's almost like this, almost like that, or not
[00:54:21.040 --> 00:54:24.800]   quite what you wanted over here, which is the problem you get when you're buying a Mac.
[00:54:24.800 --> 00:54:29.680]   But then you're talking about you get to the paragraph simplicity, intuitive, familiar,
[00:54:29.680 --> 00:54:30.680]   and easy to use.
[00:54:30.680 --> 00:54:32.080]   PCs do what you want.
[00:54:32.080 --> 00:54:33.080]   They just work.
[00:54:33.080 --> 00:54:36.080]   And you're like, okay, why not play?
[00:54:36.080 --> 00:54:37.080]   We're rolling back.
[00:54:37.080 --> 00:54:39.760]   It's four more downs, 20 yard penalty.
[00:54:39.760 --> 00:54:43.320]   Off sides, personal file.
[00:54:43.320 --> 00:54:45.400]   Microsoft, I want to stop you there.
[00:54:45.400 --> 00:54:46.400]   Thanks for coming in.
[00:54:46.400 --> 00:54:48.080]   We'll keep your resume and headshot on file.
[00:54:48.080 --> 00:54:49.080]   There's the door.
[00:54:49.080 --> 00:54:50.080]   Yeah.
[00:54:50.080 --> 00:54:51.080]   John?
[00:54:51.080 --> 00:54:52.080]   Yeah.
[00:54:52.080 --> 00:54:53.680]   So there's a couple of days ago.
[00:54:53.680 --> 00:54:55.200]   A couple of issues, really.
[00:54:55.200 --> 00:54:57.160]   It doesn't look very good.
[00:54:57.160 --> 00:54:59.360]   It seems a bit disjointed.
[00:54:59.360 --> 00:55:02.960]   With Apple, when you get the Apple message about PCs versus Mac, it's a very sort of
[00:55:02.960 --> 00:55:04.920]   cohering story.
[00:55:04.920 --> 00:55:08.040]   It feels as though it's actually coming from the top, whereas this particular page on this
[00:55:08.040 --> 00:55:12.200]   website, it does feel very much as a subdivision somewhere has gone away and done this sort
[00:55:12.200 --> 00:55:15.040]   of on their own, rather than the corporate message from across the world.
[00:55:15.040 --> 00:55:17.080]   It seems very amateurish the way they put it together.
[00:55:17.080 --> 00:55:21.920]   In many ways, isn't this indicative of the difference between Microsoft and Apple?
[00:55:21.920 --> 00:55:23.240]   Yeah, it could be.
[00:55:23.240 --> 00:55:24.240]   It could be.
[00:55:24.240 --> 00:55:26.000]   I mean, there was some tweets.
[00:55:26.000 --> 00:55:30.680]   I actually need to pull it out, but someone sort of compared the Apple site on choosing
[00:55:30.680 --> 00:55:34.800]   a Mac over PC and compared this one and just world's part.
[00:55:34.800 --> 00:55:39.040]   It seems to spread fear uncertainty and doubt, you know, it's food.
[00:55:39.040 --> 00:55:41.520]   Basically, if you're a Mac user and you look at this page, you can see through it straight
[00:55:41.520 --> 00:55:42.520]   away.
[00:55:42.520 --> 00:55:45.280]   And as Andy said, there's plenty of good points that they do make, but the sum that just,
[00:55:45.280 --> 00:55:48.480]   you know, might have been applicable 10 years ago, but surely not now.
[00:55:48.480 --> 00:55:52.800]   But again, only a Mac user would know that a PC user would not know this.
[00:55:52.800 --> 00:55:56.960]   So it's just sort of prolonging the, some of the, some of the older thoughts about, you
[00:55:56.960 --> 00:56:01.160]   know, using a Mac and the perceived limitations in nearly days.
[00:56:01.160 --> 00:56:05.920]   Does it do more to hold onto your current users than really attract new ones?
[00:56:05.920 --> 00:56:08.800]   Because the other thing is, are people are really going to find this page?
[00:56:08.800 --> 00:56:10.720]   Yeah, that's exactly the thing I was going to say.
[00:56:10.720 --> 00:56:17.360]   I think it's a, this is more feel good fodder for Windows users than it is to convert people
[00:56:17.360 --> 00:56:18.800]   from the Mac over to Windows.
[00:56:18.800 --> 00:56:19.960]   So this is, Hey, look at this.
[00:56:19.960 --> 00:56:23.360]   They said it's simple and we're going to have something to tell your friends.
[00:56:23.360 --> 00:56:24.360]   Yeah.
[00:56:24.360 --> 00:56:25.360]   Yeah.
[00:56:25.360 --> 00:56:28.320]   Copy these paragraphs into your favorite trolling blog rant.
[00:56:28.320 --> 00:56:31.680]   And I will say that, you know, I was talking to someone about PC versus Macs and I thought,
[00:56:31.680 --> 00:56:35.840]   you know, I probably spent, you know, somewhere between 20 and 40% of my day on a, on a Windows
[00:56:35.840 --> 00:56:36.840]   machine.
[00:56:36.840 --> 00:56:40.680]   It's a Mac, but it's got Windows running on it because I, there are specialty applications
[00:56:40.680 --> 00:56:45.000]   that we need that, that I need to be on a, you know, if I'm using motion builder, which
[00:56:45.000 --> 00:56:48.520]   is this high end software and there's some other graphics pieces and conversion tools
[00:56:48.520 --> 00:56:50.760]   and lots of things that I just can't find on a Mac.
[00:56:50.760 --> 00:56:55.000]   And so I'll, I'll swap over, you know, into Windows and, and make that work.
[00:56:55.000 --> 00:56:57.440]   We're looking at developing some hardware at our office.
[00:56:57.440 --> 00:56:58.440]   We're not developing on Mac.
[00:56:58.440 --> 00:57:03.600]   We're developing most likely on Linux because we, you know, we can't design what we need.
[00:57:03.600 --> 00:57:06.600]   So there's a lot of reason for, for that open and I think there's a lot of advantages.
[00:57:06.600 --> 00:57:09.680]   The problem is, is when they, you know, when they protest too much.
[00:57:09.680 --> 00:57:11.240]   Yeah, you know, look at the headline.
[00:57:11.240 --> 00:57:14.080]   It says deciding between a PC and a Mac, right?
[00:57:14.080 --> 00:57:16.080]   Which is misleading because you can run.
[00:57:16.080 --> 00:57:20.200]   It should be, it should be deciding between Windows and Mac OS 10, you know, kind of thing,
[00:57:20.200 --> 00:57:21.440]   which it, it is not.
[00:57:21.440 --> 00:57:24.360]   Also in this, in a related story, Dell has published.
[00:57:24.360 --> 00:57:27.720]   The way from the Alex can I just make one more, one more point about this, this particular
[00:57:27.720 --> 00:57:30.120]   page, which is, which really has irritated me considerably.
[00:57:30.120 --> 00:57:32.400]   And that's the, you've actually go to the page.
[00:57:32.400 --> 00:57:36.840]   There's a, what looks to be a Twitter feed in the sidebar, which is what the buzz is about.
[00:57:36.840 --> 00:57:40.840]   And then you have a standard sort of scrolling Twitter feed of people making nice comments
[00:57:40.840 --> 00:57:43.160]   about Windows 7, et cetera.
[00:57:43.160 --> 00:57:46.280]   And okay, fair enough, you know, obviously there's lots of Windows users and they will
[00:57:46.280 --> 00:57:47.400]   be generating lots of tweets.
[00:57:47.400 --> 00:57:49.080]   So this is fairly, you know, that's great.
[00:57:49.080 --> 00:57:53.240]   But I close the page down and someone else mentioned something about the page and I went
[00:57:53.240 --> 00:57:54.240]   back to it.
[00:57:54.240 --> 00:57:56.160]   And I saw the very same tweets appearing again.
[00:57:56.160 --> 00:58:00.640]   And if you, if it's actually not a live Twitter feed, it's actually curated tweets that
[00:58:00.640 --> 00:58:04.720]   they've captured and are presenting it, although it doesn't say it's a live Twitter feed.
[00:58:04.720 --> 00:58:07.120]   It just looks like a live Twitter feed.
[00:58:07.120 --> 00:58:08.960]   And I just found that to be really disingenuous.
[00:58:08.960 --> 00:58:13.760]   Really, you know, that's, you know, it's sort of, it's just, give me a nice feeling.
[00:58:13.760 --> 00:58:14.760]   Yeah, that's the thing.
[00:58:14.760 --> 00:58:16.360]   Well, that's a pretty common thing to do though.
[00:58:16.360 --> 00:58:20.800]   I mean, when we see movie reviews, we have like entertaining, even though they said, even
[00:58:20.800 --> 00:58:25.940]   though the whole comment was, it's entertaining if you're a rodent, you know, you know, that
[00:58:25.940 --> 00:58:29.040]   kind of thing, you know, it's, right, right.
[00:58:29.040 --> 00:58:30.040]   Andy.
[00:58:30.040 --> 00:58:35.680]   Well, I mean, when I first saw that Twitter, that ticker, I did say, well, I wonder what
[00:58:35.680 --> 00:58:39.960]   would happen if I were to sort of like paste some of these Twitter, Twitter handles, like
[00:58:39.960 --> 00:58:43.080]   into Twitter.com slash and take a look at the entire feed.
[00:58:43.080 --> 00:58:46.560]   And was almost disappointed to find that almost all of them are in fact real genuine
[00:58:46.560 --> 00:58:47.560]   Twitter feeds.
[00:58:47.560 --> 00:58:50.920]   Then they're not like, they're not like owned by Microsoft or something like that, or at
[00:58:50.920 --> 00:58:54.400]   least they don't appear to be owned by Microsoft or something like that.
[00:58:54.400 --> 00:58:58.120]   But I don't think there's anything wrong with them simply saying that they can't, they
[00:58:58.120 --> 00:58:59.960]   can't simply say that anything.
[00:58:59.960 --> 00:59:04.880]   If you want to say anything about Microsoft Windows and have it appear on Microsoft.com,
[00:59:04.880 --> 00:59:08.600]   just use the hashtag window seven and we're sure it's going to work out just perfectly
[00:59:08.600 --> 00:59:09.600]   fine.
[00:59:09.600 --> 00:59:10.600]   Yeah.
[00:59:10.600 --> 00:59:12.640]   They could they can pay someone to sit there and just, you know, remove the ones from Mac
[00:59:12.640 --> 00:59:13.640]   users, couldn't they?
[00:59:13.640 --> 00:59:15.400]   And just, you know, just have real life.
[00:59:15.400 --> 00:59:19.360]   I think it's more like they just flag a handful of them that there's, there's particularly
[00:59:19.360 --> 00:59:20.840]   good and particularly useful.
[00:59:20.840 --> 00:59:23.280]   Now Dell Dell, of course, jumped on this bandwagon as well.
[00:59:23.280 --> 00:59:29.000]   They're trying to, of course, we are comparing apples to apples in the in the Dell webpage.
[00:59:29.000 --> 00:59:31.000]   And of course, this is dealing with back to school.
[00:59:31.000 --> 00:59:39.800]   So they're really aiming at this low end or low cost pieces and they're trying to interconnect,
[00:59:39.800 --> 00:59:42.160]   you know, the fact that it's much cheaper to get what you need.
[00:59:42.160 --> 00:59:47.640]   And this is on top of news that is has been coming out that Apple is selling as many as
[00:59:47.640 --> 00:59:54.280]   half of the students entering college this year are planning to get a Mac computer.
[00:59:54.280 --> 00:59:59.080]   So, you know, and this was a huge change from only five years ago, Apple just kind of focused
[00:59:59.080 --> 01:00:04.520]   the their apple eye on this on this market and seems to have made big inroads.
[01:00:04.520 --> 01:00:09.800]   Andy, what do you think of the data that they're that they're comparing here as it as we look
[01:00:09.800 --> 01:00:10.800]   at it?
[01:00:10.800 --> 01:00:12.560]   I think it's right on the money.
[01:00:12.560 --> 01:00:18.600]   I mean, I it's it's hard to it's it's a diverse group of people that are buying machines for
[01:00:18.600 --> 01:00:22.080]   college, but everybody wants to get a Mac.
[01:00:22.080 --> 01:00:26.040]   And I talked to people individually when I individually about what they're buying, what
[01:00:26.040 --> 01:00:32.720]   they're hoping to get is a $999 MacBook and not even like a $1,500 top of the line windows
[01:00:32.720 --> 01:00:33.720]   machine.
[01:00:33.720 --> 01:00:35.400]   So this is right in line with what I've been saying.
[01:00:35.400 --> 01:00:38.440]   It's also right in line with other studies I've seen from other sources.
[01:00:38.440 --> 01:00:44.880]   Is is so is part of this that for the average student, Fred, the average student is doesn't
[01:00:44.880 --> 01:00:46.840]   need big graphics cards.
[01:00:46.840 --> 01:00:50.280]   The average student doesn't need and and a lot of them have gotten to the point where
[01:00:50.280 --> 01:00:51.280]   they're good enough.
[01:00:51.280 --> 01:00:55.240]   We're talking about 200 and we used to think that a game machine had 256 megs of V-ram
[01:00:55.240 --> 01:00:56.240]   was great.
[01:00:56.240 --> 01:00:58.080]   Now we have laptops that have more than that.
[01:00:58.080 --> 01:01:03.040]   So the thing is that we're looking at a lot of machines that at 999 are good enough and
[01:01:03.040 --> 01:01:07.360]   it doesn't really matter whether they're they're the craziest, fastest thing in the world.
[01:01:07.360 --> 01:01:09.960]   Once again, this gets back to the apples argument of being a truck.
[01:01:09.960 --> 01:01:16.080]   So is it is an issue where students want that fashion item want that slightly more stable,
[01:01:16.080 --> 01:01:18.840]   more media driven item than than anything else?
[01:01:18.840 --> 01:01:21.840]   I think yeah, I think you hit it largely on ahead.
[01:01:21.840 --> 01:01:26.240]   I think it's it's a lot of it is perception and brand perception and affinity, but it's
[01:01:26.240 --> 01:01:28.760]   also the ecosystem.
[01:01:28.760 --> 01:01:29.760]   Right.
[01:01:29.760 --> 01:01:34.880]   So if they're going in there with their new eye touch that you call it.
[01:01:34.880 --> 01:01:36.320]   I touch their eye.
[01:01:36.320 --> 01:01:41.440]   That's a great name or they're you know, you should you should trademark it or their
[01:01:41.440 --> 01:01:42.440]   iPhone.
[01:01:42.440 --> 01:01:43.440]   Yeah, of course.
[01:01:43.440 --> 01:01:47.800]   Either iPhones and they're using iTunes presumably and they're in the whole I universe already
[01:01:47.800 --> 01:01:51.160]   that it makes sense to stay in there with a Mac, right?
[01:01:51.160 --> 01:01:53.120]   Not that you have to, right?
[01:01:53.120 --> 01:01:56.720]   But to stay in there with a Mac, in there using all the Apple stuff already plus Apple
[01:01:56.720 --> 01:02:00.640]   has that incredible horsepower and momentum moving forward.
[01:02:00.640 --> 01:02:01.640]   Why not?
[01:02:01.640 --> 01:02:04.920]   And my roommate has it and I can use her salt and all this stuff, you know.
[01:02:04.920 --> 01:02:07.960]   So I think it's just it's part of the whole ecosystem.
[01:02:07.960 --> 01:02:12.520]   And then on top of that, the icing on the cake is the the brand cache that that Apple
[01:02:12.520 --> 01:02:14.920]   has, you know, and students want that.
[01:02:14.920 --> 01:02:19.360]   You know, I think that for me, the big thing is that I don't, someone was, we were specking
[01:02:19.360 --> 01:02:25.840]   out tens of computers for a company and they were asking, why do we get, why are we getting
[01:02:25.840 --> 01:02:27.320]   the Apple hardware instead of PC?
[01:02:27.320 --> 01:02:29.520]   Even though a lot of what we're going to be doing is on the windows, I was like, well,
[01:02:29.520 --> 01:02:30.920]   you get both platforms.
[01:02:30.920 --> 01:02:32.080]   You know, I don't have to.
[01:02:32.080 --> 01:02:33.080]   Now I don't have to choose.
[01:02:33.080 --> 01:02:36.720]   I can I can run anything on a PC, anything on a Mac and I just get the same hardware, but
[01:02:36.720 --> 01:02:38.920]   almost all the machines that we get are dual boot.
[01:02:38.920 --> 01:02:43.160]   You know, I and so I think but this I think is a challenge for Dell is because Dell of
[01:02:43.160 --> 01:02:48.920]   course is selling those PCs, you know, they they're stuck in that that singular platform
[01:02:48.920 --> 01:02:52.720]   where if you buy an Apple machine, you're getting both platforms.
[01:02:52.720 --> 01:02:55.760]   So I think that's one of the, you know, one of the issues that you that you get into,
[01:02:55.760 --> 01:02:59.120]   you know, I think that the Dell, I think there's a lot of things when I look at the performance
[01:02:59.120 --> 01:03:08.040]   that you get on many of these machines, the the raw performance on a PC, I think no matter
[01:03:08.040 --> 01:03:12.160]   how you compare it is better than a Mac for the same price.
[01:03:12.160 --> 01:03:13.400]   I mean, I don't I'm not going to.
[01:03:13.400 --> 01:03:17.680]   I think that you are if you're looking for if you're geeky, you know, and you're willing
[01:03:17.680 --> 01:03:23.880]   to dig into it, it is you're going to get a better value on with a Windows machine.
[01:03:23.880 --> 01:03:25.960]   They solely on performance, right.
[01:03:25.960 --> 01:03:27.840]   They solely on performance.
[01:03:27.840 --> 01:03:34.600]   You know, as as you start to dig into the the ease of use as stability, but when you
[01:03:34.600 --> 01:03:40.160]   want to use the machine, it will render all day faster than a Mac, but when you decide
[01:03:40.160 --> 01:03:43.400]   to use it for stuff, then you hit roadblocks, right.
[01:03:43.400 --> 01:03:46.560]   But there's still but there's still two areas in which Apple just can't compete.
[01:03:46.560 --> 01:03:48.920]   One is price and the other isn't gaming.
[01:03:48.920 --> 01:03:52.160]   And those are two really big issues when you're talking about someone who's going into school
[01:03:52.160 --> 01:03:53.320]   for the first time.
[01:03:53.320 --> 01:03:58.880]   Because there are a lot of people who want their desktop machine is just an ungodly Jesus
[01:03:58.880 --> 01:04:01.920]   wept digital killing machine.
[01:04:01.920 --> 01:04:05.400]   And when people make that transition from their home into the first college dorm, they
[01:04:05.400 --> 01:04:06.800]   really want to take that with them.
[01:04:06.800 --> 01:04:11.120]   They can build a they can have a really good gaming laptop for $800, $900.
[01:04:11.120 --> 01:04:14.160]   They really can't do that on the Mac for less than 1500.
[01:04:14.160 --> 01:04:16.440]   And even then they're dealing with a lack of software.
[01:04:16.440 --> 01:04:19.840]   And then they're the folks who just don't have a thousand bucks to spend in a notebook.
[01:04:19.840 --> 01:04:23.960]   And then when you show them, especially when you see that HP particularly is willing to
[01:04:23.960 --> 01:04:29.680]   make sure that we're going to make a kick butt $549 laptop that to at least surface
[01:04:29.680 --> 01:04:35.600]   appearances have will make you sacrifice very, very little compared to an $800 or a $900
[01:04:35.600 --> 01:04:36.600]   Windows notebook.
[01:04:36.600 --> 01:04:38.680]   That's a really hard thing to sell somebody on.
[01:04:38.680 --> 01:04:41.480]   It's hard to upsell them to an Apple at that point.
[01:04:41.480 --> 01:04:46.480]   Yeah, I mean, maybe it's heresy, but you know, for me it's it gaming machines are Xboxes
[01:04:46.480 --> 01:04:51.640]   and PlayStations and that kind of thing and we as their separate from my Mac world.
[01:04:51.640 --> 01:04:56.920]   Well, and I have to admit that part of the the foundation of me wanting Apple, you know,
[01:04:56.920 --> 01:05:01.240]   wishing probably that Apple would open source or license OS 10 when they're when they're
[01:05:01.240 --> 01:05:02.240]   done with it.
[01:05:02.240 --> 01:05:10.000]   I really think that OS, you know, iOS five, you know, is is OS 11, you know, you know,
[01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:14.560]   you know, so so I think that, you know, I think that I personally think that's the direction
[01:05:14.560 --> 01:05:18.960]   taking the old interface, the old operating system and making that available to companies
[01:05:18.960 --> 01:05:24.000]   like Dell and HP and and allowing us to have allowing them to soup the machines up.
[01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:27.560]   My problem right now is that you seem you seeing meckles 10 would be sloppy seconds that they
[01:05:27.560 --> 01:05:29.560]   would then let go out.
[01:05:29.560 --> 01:05:34.040]   Well, they focus on the new iOS, which is the new big thing.
[01:05:34.040 --> 01:05:35.040]   They're going down that path.
[01:05:35.040 --> 01:05:38.520]   They, you know, all the machines, you know, I think that the I personally think that the
[01:05:38.520 --> 01:05:42.400]   magic pad, magic trackpad or whatever is is the beginning of that where we're going
[01:05:42.400 --> 01:05:45.720]   to make sure that you can interface with your Mac in the same way that you can interface
[01:05:45.720 --> 01:05:50.040]   with your iPad and your iPhone so that if you're building applications, you know, because
[01:05:50.040 --> 01:05:53.880]   there's a lot of applications on my iPad that I just want to run on my on my truck.
[01:05:53.880 --> 01:05:57.240]   Yeah, you know, and so so the thing is is that have, you know, that is so I think that
[01:05:57.240 --> 01:05:58.240]   they're going down that direction.
[01:05:58.240 --> 01:06:02.440]   And the reason that I want that is because Apple is behind when it comes to the truck
[01:06:02.440 --> 01:06:05.120]   development, you know, they they're so focused on iPhones.
[01:06:05.120 --> 01:06:06.320]   They're so focused on iPads.
[01:06:06.320 --> 01:06:07.480]   People like me who need the trucks.
[01:06:07.480 --> 01:06:09.960]   I need big machines.
[01:06:09.960 --> 01:06:13.160]   It's fine that they gave us a 12 Proq machine.
[01:06:13.160 --> 01:06:14.640]   That's not, I mean, I want more.
[01:06:14.640 --> 01:06:15.680]   You know, I want more.
[01:06:15.680 --> 01:06:17.000]   I want more drives.
[01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:18.440]   I want bigger graphics machines.
[01:06:18.440 --> 01:06:20.560]   I want, I want all this stuff to be added on.
[01:06:20.560 --> 01:06:22.640]   You're a sub sub sub minority though.
[01:06:22.640 --> 01:06:23.640]   That's fine.
[01:06:23.640 --> 01:06:27.200]   The point is is that on the PC platform and on the Linux platform, people like me,
[01:06:27.200 --> 01:06:32.600]   are taken care of because because because those things now, why do we not use them that much?
[01:06:32.600 --> 01:06:36.120]   Is because because we still have to use windows to deal with it and I still have to deal with
[01:06:36.120 --> 01:06:38.640]   viruses and instabilities and all these other things.
[01:06:38.640 --> 01:06:42.360]   And I have to deal with 60 versions of the same, you know, like, is it compatible with
[01:06:42.360 --> 01:06:43.360]   the hardware that I bought?
[01:06:43.360 --> 01:06:44.360]   And you know, all those things.
[01:06:44.360 --> 01:06:46.880]   So those are the challenges that are that are going down that path.
[01:06:46.880 --> 01:06:51.400]   But for people like me who need that heavy hardware or need specialized hardware, you
[01:06:51.400 --> 01:06:57.040]   can't, you know, I go, well, you know, we might need to use, you know, we do use.
[01:06:57.040 --> 01:06:59.240]   PCs, you know, to go down that path.
[01:06:59.240 --> 01:07:00.240]   Sure.
[01:07:00.240 --> 01:07:01.240]   You know, I don't.
[01:07:01.240 --> 01:07:02.840]   That's a very, darn, I'm sorry.
[01:07:02.840 --> 01:07:03.840]   You had to go.
[01:07:03.840 --> 01:07:08.360]   I was just going to go back to your point, Andy, about, you know, Apple can't compete
[01:07:08.360 --> 01:07:09.560]   on price at the low end.
[01:07:09.560 --> 01:07:10.560]   And I think you're right.
[01:07:10.560 --> 01:07:13.560]   They can't, but the reason they can't is because they don't want to.
[01:07:13.560 --> 01:07:18.040]   And I think Apple have always tried to build a quality product at a reasonable price.
[01:07:18.040 --> 01:07:20.600]   Some people might think it's not reasonable, but, you know, there's build quality, there's
[01:07:20.600 --> 01:07:23.960]   reliability, et cetera, there's quality of components, et cetera.
[01:07:23.960 --> 01:07:28.640]   But it seems I always like the analogy of the, you know, the car analogy of, you know, a
[01:07:28.640 --> 01:07:29.920]   low price car and high price car.
[01:07:29.920 --> 01:07:34.160]   They both basically do the same job, but, you know, the higher price car is completely
[01:07:34.160 --> 01:07:36.040]   different beaks to the low price car.
[01:07:36.040 --> 01:07:37.040]   They do the same thing.
[01:07:37.040 --> 01:07:40.000]   They get it from A to B, but they do it in a different way.
[01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:45.520]   And I think it's the price differential is extremely marked at the low end, you know,
[01:07:45.520 --> 01:07:48.480]   the lowest priced Mac compared to the lowest priced PC on netbook.
[01:07:48.480 --> 01:07:52.320]   But I think when you get up into the high range machines, I think that differential
[01:07:52.320 --> 01:07:58.040]   does, you know, drop off if you actually spec up a high end PC from Dell, you know, a high
[01:07:58.040 --> 01:07:59.440]   end notebook.
[01:07:59.440 --> 01:08:01.840]   It's pretty comparable to a high end Apple.
[01:08:01.840 --> 01:08:04.040]   It's not, it's not the price performance that I'm talking about.
[01:08:04.040 --> 01:08:08.120]   What I need is I need more PCI, I need more boards.
[01:08:08.120 --> 01:08:09.960]   So, so I'm a perfect example of someone.
[01:08:09.960 --> 01:08:13.760]   It's not, it's not, I mean, it's not that I don't care about the price, but the price
[01:08:13.760 --> 01:08:18.320]   for me is not as important as being able to put more internal drives in or being able
[01:08:18.320 --> 01:08:24.640]   to put more boards in or being able to have USB three, which Apple is woefully behind
[01:08:24.640 --> 01:08:25.640]   on.
[01:08:25.640 --> 01:08:28.720]   It is, it is actually starting to hurt our business to, you know, you know, for me to
[01:08:28.720 --> 01:08:32.600]   have to add USB three slots to everything because I, because I now have lots and lots
[01:08:32.600 --> 01:08:37.400]   of video tools that are using USB three and Apple is got their head in the sand somewhere.
[01:08:37.400 --> 01:08:38.960]   You know, I don't, I don't, I don't get it.
[01:08:38.960 --> 01:08:42.760]   I don't get why they released the Mac Pro without USB three slots.
[01:08:42.760 --> 01:08:46.000]   So now I'm going to have to add those in that takes up some of my slots in the back.
[01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:47.920]   I just want to be able to buy the machine the way I want to buy it.
[01:08:47.920 --> 01:08:52.680]   You know, and the thing is, is that if Apple's not going to keep up with it, it's fine.
[01:08:52.680 --> 01:08:54.280]   Just let everybody else keep up with it.
[01:08:54.280 --> 01:08:57.840]   You know, and you keep on focusing on the iPad and the iPhone, you know, it's fine with
[01:08:57.840 --> 01:08:58.840]   me to do that.
[01:08:58.840 --> 01:09:02.760]   I don't, you know, but that's the frustration I have is that Apple isn't keeping up with
[01:09:02.760 --> 01:09:07.000]   the trucks and, you know, and then we're kind of stuck in that area.
[01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:09.040]   And I think that's the, that is the advantage.
[01:09:09.040 --> 01:09:10.320]   You know, the PC and Linux boxes.
[01:09:10.320 --> 01:09:11.320]   Okay.
[01:09:11.320 --> 01:09:16.560]   Last story before we move on to picks of the week, we've got, this is, you know, another
[01:09:16.560 --> 01:09:18.720]   story that bubbles up every once in a while.
[01:09:18.720 --> 01:09:26.760]   FTC, according to Apple Insider is the United States Federal Trade Commission has denied
[01:09:26.760 --> 01:09:33.120]   Freedom of Information Act request for the documents related to the complaint filed by
[01:09:33.120 --> 01:09:37.240]   Adobe against Apple stating that the release of the information would be, would impede
[01:09:37.240 --> 01:09:39.480]   the commission's quote unquote law enforcement duties.
[01:09:39.480 --> 01:09:45.520]   So this is bringing up the rumor again that the FTC is, is kind of researching and figuring
[01:09:45.520 --> 01:09:48.120]   out what to do about flash.
[01:09:48.120 --> 01:09:52.960]   Do we, do we think this is going to yield any changes, Frederick?
[01:09:52.960 --> 01:09:55.920]   Um, I don't think so.
[01:09:55.920 --> 01:09:58.960]   And I like was not paying attention to
[01:09:58.960 --> 01:10:03.920]   You said, see, I just threw that ball right at him.
[01:10:03.920 --> 01:10:04.920]   He was like, near the bus.
[01:10:04.920 --> 01:10:05.920]   I threw him.
[01:10:05.920 --> 01:10:06.920]   I threw him out to the bus.
[01:10:06.920 --> 01:10:07.920]   They now emerge from the bus.
[01:10:07.920 --> 01:10:08.920]   I know.
[01:10:08.920 --> 01:10:11.440]   See, I keep like, I got a no look past.
[01:10:11.440 --> 01:10:12.440]   See, yeah, exactly.
[01:10:12.440 --> 01:10:14.440]   I was researching my big of the week.
[01:10:14.440 --> 01:10:15.440]   I threw it over.
[01:10:15.440 --> 01:10:16.440]   I threw it.
[01:10:16.440 --> 01:10:20.560]   I, I, what happened was, is I was running one way and I threw it crossfield and, and
[01:10:20.560 --> 01:10:23.000]   Frederick ran a post instead of a instead of an hour.
[01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:24.000]   That was for sure.
[01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:25.000]   I had a one in three chance.
[01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:26.000]   Right.
[01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:27.000]   That was for sure.
[01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:28.000]   He's going to throw in somebody else.
[01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:32.040]   I've been throwing the first, I've been throwing first down plays to Andy most of the time.
[01:10:32.040 --> 01:10:37.200]   And he was expecting a third down running running play to Fred Rickin before I had to
[01:10:37.200 --> 01:10:38.200]   answer exactly.
[01:10:38.200 --> 01:10:41.040]   And Don's like, I don't understand all these American football references.
[01:10:41.040 --> 01:10:42.880]   No, you know what the problem is.
[01:10:42.880 --> 01:10:43.880]   It's just flash.
[01:10:43.880 --> 01:10:46.440]   You mentioned flash to anyone who knows anything about Apple and they just switch off now.
[01:10:46.440 --> 01:10:49.520]   You know, after all the furora about the iPhone and the iPad, et cetera.
[01:10:49.520 --> 01:10:50.520]   Flash blank.
[01:10:50.520 --> 01:10:51.520]   You know, but.
[01:10:51.520 --> 01:10:55.880]   Well, do you think here's the thing is, is, is when I talk to people about, you know,
[01:10:55.880 --> 01:10:58.320]   using flash, I go, I don't think I would do that.
[01:10:58.320 --> 01:11:00.400]   You know, that's, that's kind of my response.
[01:11:00.400 --> 01:11:04.160]   Like, yeah, I don't, I wouldn't develop in that right now because we don't know.
[01:11:04.160 --> 01:11:05.160]   We don't know.
[01:11:05.160 --> 01:11:08.160]   You know, and so I just sort of soil the whole thing in terms of.
[01:11:08.160 --> 01:11:10.000]   I mean, like it's a dead technology.
[01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:11.000]   It's going away.
[01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:12.000]   But you know, I still maintain.
[01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:13.000]   I saw that it's a dead technology.
[01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:14.000]   It's it.
[01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:17.600]   I don't think it's a dead technology, but it is a, if you're going to spend millions
[01:11:17.600 --> 01:11:22.880]   of dollars developing something, you don't want to cut out a huge part of your market.
[01:11:22.880 --> 01:11:25.960]   And I think this is why the FTC is looking into it is that it's not that it's a dead
[01:11:25.960 --> 01:11:28.360]   technology, but it creates uncertainty.
[01:11:28.360 --> 01:11:32.080]   And uncertainty is something that people who are spending millions of dollars in development
[01:11:32.080 --> 01:11:33.320]   don't want to deal with.
[01:11:33.320 --> 01:11:36.160]   You know, you don't want to know that I don't know how this is going to go.
[01:11:36.160 --> 01:11:37.160]   Andy.
[01:11:37.160 --> 01:11:41.760]   Well, I think, well, in general, Adobe's just reacting the way that Apple would if
[01:11:41.760 --> 01:11:48.480]   a large huge company suddenly said that support of Mackintosh networking and Mackintosh disk
[01:11:48.480 --> 01:11:52.600]   formats was irrelevant because it's an old dying technology and it makes things buggy
[01:11:52.600 --> 01:11:53.600]   and crashing.
[01:11:53.600 --> 01:11:57.840]   Adobe is very is just doing they're defending their intellectual property in their business,
[01:11:57.840 --> 01:12:00.280]   which is something that they really should be doing.
[01:12:00.280 --> 01:12:05.560]   I think that in terms of this new revelation that they can't get access to these files,
[01:12:05.560 --> 01:12:09.840]   I did talk to somebody because this is another one of those very broad areas where I get
[01:12:09.840 --> 01:12:13.920]   into it, then quickly check off that box that says, Andy, you don't know what you're talking
[01:12:13.920 --> 01:12:14.920]   about here.
[01:12:14.920 --> 01:12:19.200]   And so I rented a C&I nerd to try to explain how the FCC works.
[01:12:19.200 --> 01:12:22.680]   And the way that they explain it to me is that oftentimes it's kind of like between
[01:12:22.680 --> 01:12:25.120]   the FCC and asking for these documents.
[01:12:25.120 --> 01:12:32.080]   It's kind of like asking for information about a long since declassified operation from World
[01:12:32.080 --> 01:12:38.280]   War II, where it really doesn't matter that this spy paid off some guy 20 bucks for this
[01:12:38.280 --> 01:12:43.600]   piece of information in Spain in 1943 anymore.
[01:12:43.600 --> 01:12:48.400]   But that is when they denied it's not because they're protecting this operation, but because
[01:12:48.400 --> 01:12:51.040]   there's something that's connected to this that could be connected to this in the long
[01:12:51.040 --> 01:12:52.040]   run.
[01:12:52.040 --> 01:12:56.560]   So what it came down to is I walked away thinking that just because the FCC is not releasing
[01:12:56.560 --> 01:13:00.800]   this file does not necessarily mean that they're pursuing an action against Apple for Flash.
[01:13:00.800 --> 01:13:05.560]   It just means that this request, the information contained in this file is in some way relevant
[01:13:05.560 --> 01:13:07.880]   to anything else that they could be looking into at the moment.
[01:13:07.880 --> 01:13:09.920]   Do you think there's any merit?
[01:13:09.920 --> 01:13:11.200]   I don't think there's any merit.
[01:13:11.200 --> 01:13:17.080]   They went to, I had another lawyer, trying to explain that one to me, saying that in order
[01:13:17.080 --> 01:13:23.400]   for any company to prove that Apple is doing anything illegal that they should be enjoined
[01:13:23.400 --> 01:13:29.800]   into supporting Flash should say that they have an interest in destroying this technology,
[01:13:29.800 --> 01:13:34.240]   that their business is being hurt by the presence of this other business and that therefore
[01:13:34.240 --> 01:13:39.400]   they're trying to collapse the Adobe's business in order to endure to make their own balance
[01:13:39.400 --> 01:13:40.640]   sheets better.
[01:13:40.640 --> 01:13:45.160]   And right now all they can say, well, anybody can truthfully say is that Apple is making
[01:13:45.160 --> 01:13:48.960]   a creative choice, that they don't want to support this because it doesn't make sense
[01:13:48.960 --> 01:13:52.960]   to them and gives them a lot more work for a very little payoff as far as they're concerned.
[01:13:52.960 --> 01:13:56.880]   And for that reason, it's like the lawsuit saying that my coffee was a little too cold.
[01:13:56.880 --> 01:13:59.120]   I'm going to sue Starbucks for $8 million.
[01:13:59.120 --> 01:14:03.240]   Okay, you can sue it, sue them, but unless you can prove how you were harmed by this, you're
[01:14:03.240 --> 01:14:04.440]   not going to get very far with that.
[01:14:04.440 --> 01:14:06.640]   And I think that's where all these things are going to end.
[01:14:06.640 --> 01:14:08.000]   Frederick, are you ready?
[01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:09.000]   I am ready.
[01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:11.200]   Here's the question for you.
[01:14:11.200 --> 01:14:13.160]   I am fully prepared now.
[01:14:13.160 --> 01:14:14.160]   Bring it up.
[01:14:14.160 --> 01:14:16.400]   Here's the question I have for you.
[01:14:16.400 --> 01:14:24.240]   Is does the success of the Android platform start to blunt any kind of argument that Apple
[01:14:24.240 --> 01:14:28.680]   has any kind of monopoly and therefore would, you know, they could really damage an entire
[01:14:28.680 --> 01:14:29.680]   market.
[01:14:29.680 --> 01:14:35.040]   The fact that the iPhone and possibly the iPad is getting a smaller and smaller market share,
[01:14:35.040 --> 01:14:36.920]   does that undermine Adobe's case?
[01:14:36.920 --> 01:14:37.920]   Absolutely.
[01:14:37.920 --> 01:14:38.920]   Yeah.
[01:14:38.920 --> 01:14:39.920]   Yeah.
[01:14:39.920 --> 01:14:44.320]   Because the whole thing, yeah, it goes away completely in my opinion or it gets diluted.
[01:14:44.320 --> 01:14:46.640]   But back to the other point of Flash a little bit.
[01:14:46.640 --> 01:14:48.160]   Just wanted to talk about that.
[01:14:48.160 --> 01:14:55.160]   So the, a lot of the perception that I hear is that, you know, it's either Flash or HTML
[01:14:55.160 --> 01:14:59.640]   5, you know, that, you know, Flash is a dead technology because HTML 5 can do.
[01:14:59.640 --> 01:15:05.440]   All this magical stuff, you know, but I think that's bunk, you know, because I think on
[01:15:05.440 --> 01:15:11.040]   the Flash side, there's these robust applications out there that I don't believe unless.
[01:15:11.040 --> 01:15:12.040]   Well, this is the biggest problem.
[01:15:12.040 --> 01:15:15.360]   What you're pointing to is the biggest problem with HTML 5 is there's no good authoring tools.
[01:15:15.360 --> 01:15:16.920]   Well, I mean, not even authoring tools.
[01:15:16.920 --> 01:15:20.720]   Even if there were robust, amazing authoring tools, I don't see you creating a go-to meeting
[01:15:20.720 --> 01:15:27.480]   or a go-to webinar, whatever, and executing that kind of level software in HTML 5.
[01:15:27.480 --> 01:15:30.560]   It's kind of deep, intricate applications that need to run.
[01:15:30.560 --> 01:15:31.560]   Well, I think you could.
[01:15:31.560 --> 01:15:35.480]   I think you could do it, but I don't think that the problem is, is that without a, and
[01:15:35.480 --> 01:15:38.560]   this is the problem that QuickTime had, QuickTime was as good as Flash in 2000.
[01:15:38.560 --> 01:15:40.840]   You know, they were equal on equal footing.
[01:15:40.840 --> 01:15:47.400]   And Apple never had a good development platform and, and Flash did and, or better.
[01:15:47.400 --> 01:15:48.400]   I don't like the application.
[01:15:48.400 --> 01:15:50.760]   I think HTML 5 is a dis, but when you look at Black's.
[01:15:50.760 --> 01:15:51.760]   Well, it's largely a display thing, right?
[01:15:51.760 --> 01:15:53.760]   I mean, it's for looking at stuff.
[01:15:53.760 --> 01:15:56.640]   There's some interactivity that you can do in there, but you know, which is good and
[01:15:56.640 --> 01:15:58.360]   you can do some pretty intricate things.
[01:15:58.360 --> 01:16:04.280]   But in terms of programmatic code, when you're looking at the heavy code, that's displaying
[01:16:04.280 --> 01:16:09.600]   video, allowing chat rooms and doing all this crazy gaming and all that stuff.
[01:16:09.600 --> 01:16:13.640]   It, show me another platform out there that can do that kind of thing.
[01:16:13.640 --> 01:16:15.320]   So I think there's room for both.
[01:16:15.320 --> 01:16:16.760]   I don't want Flash on my iPad.
[01:16:16.760 --> 01:16:17.920]   I don't need it there.
[01:16:17.920 --> 01:16:21.200]   You know, I'm, I'm happy to put the apps on there that let me do all my stuff or on
[01:16:21.200 --> 01:16:22.440]   my iPhone.
[01:16:22.440 --> 01:16:26.600]   But if I sit at my computer and, you know, I'm looking at a go-to meeting, I'm like,
[01:16:26.600 --> 01:16:28.320]   "Oh, I'm a gaming thing," or whatever.
[01:16:28.320 --> 01:16:30.560]   I want a better, deeper, rich experience.
[01:16:30.560 --> 01:16:35.920]   But the issue is, is if the tablets and the phones are the future and there's no flash
[01:16:35.920 --> 01:16:37.840]   on them, is this a problem?
[01:16:37.840 --> 01:16:40.520]   Or is this just a huge opportunity for the other tablet makers?
[01:16:40.520 --> 01:16:41.520]   Maybe there's something else.
[01:16:41.520 --> 01:16:42.520]   Maybe we need another language.
[01:16:42.520 --> 01:16:43.520]   I don't know.
[01:16:43.520 --> 01:16:44.520]   And Don?
[01:16:44.520 --> 01:16:45.520]   Yeah.
[01:16:45.520 --> 01:16:47.000]   I wouldn't like to see Flash go.
[01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:51.760]   I don't think it will ever go away to be honest because there are places where Flash
[01:16:51.760 --> 01:16:52.760]   is fine.
[01:16:52.760 --> 01:16:55.960]   But, you know, I don't really miss it on the iPad.
[01:16:55.960 --> 01:16:56.960]   I really don't.
[01:16:56.960 --> 01:17:00.600]   Most of the services that I access on the iPad now have either been rewritten to cope
[01:17:00.600 --> 01:17:04.640]   with HTML5 or, you know, there are just other methods of viewing the video.
[01:17:04.640 --> 01:17:12.080]   So it really doesn't impact me in any serious way, the lack of flash on the iPad.
[01:17:12.080 --> 01:17:17.120]   And as the, you know, Android market grows and, you know, there's no, there's never going
[01:17:17.120 --> 01:17:21.160]   to be one single sort of main winner in this smartphone market.
[01:17:21.160 --> 01:17:24.600]   I mean, Apple are going to be happy to stay with selling, you know, tens of millions of
[01:17:24.600 --> 01:17:25.800]   iPhones and still have a small-
[01:17:25.800 --> 01:17:28.120]   Having to settle with tens of millions.
[01:17:28.120 --> 01:17:29.120]   Yeah.
[01:17:29.120 --> 01:17:32.360]   You know, it's just exactly the same as with the, you know, with the Mac, they've got this
[01:17:32.360 --> 01:17:34.440]   nice eight to 10 cent market share.
[01:17:34.440 --> 01:17:35.440]   They're doing very nicely.
[01:17:35.440 --> 01:17:36.640]   Thank you very much.
[01:17:36.640 --> 01:17:40.800]   And you know, I don't think for one minute that they want to have 80% of the smartphone
[01:17:40.800 --> 01:17:41.800]   market.
[01:17:41.800 --> 01:17:44.600]   And I don't think they ever will do because, you know, Android is not just a single phone
[01:17:44.600 --> 01:17:45.600]   with a single platform.
[01:17:45.600 --> 01:17:49.440]   It's, you know, multiple phones, different variants of Android and multiple vendors.
[01:17:49.440 --> 01:17:53.640]   So, you know, the whole sort of monopoly type thing really.
[01:17:53.640 --> 01:18:00.720]   In some ways, doesn't this, doesn't this problem actually underline why Apple wouldn't want
[01:18:00.720 --> 01:18:03.960]   to have a monopoly over any market?
[01:18:03.960 --> 01:18:08.520]   Because it means that they suddenly can't do what they want to do with their own platform.
[01:18:08.520 --> 01:18:12.200]   You know, they get into the issues that Microsoft had or the issues that, you know, having,
[01:18:12.200 --> 01:18:17.000]   owning any, any market means that you're going to start dealing with antitrust issues.
[01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:20.880]   Whereas if you have lots of pieces, lots of small pieces of lots of markets, it seems
[01:18:20.880 --> 01:18:26.520]   to be advantageous in some ways to, you know, retain the flexibility and control over your
[01:18:26.520 --> 01:18:27.520]   platform.
[01:18:27.520 --> 01:18:28.520]   Yeah.
[01:18:28.520 --> 01:18:29.520]   Yeah.
[01:18:29.520 --> 01:18:30.520]   I agree.
[01:18:30.520 --> 01:18:32.080]   So we've got a pixel of the week coming up here next.
[01:18:32.080 --> 01:18:34.920]   So while everyone's getting ready, are you ready?
[01:18:34.920 --> 01:18:35.920]   Are you ready?
[01:18:35.920 --> 01:18:36.920]   Are you ready?
[01:18:36.920 --> 01:18:42.800]   Before that, though, of course, we want to thank our final sponsor of the day gazelle.com.
[01:18:42.800 --> 01:18:48.120]   And gazelle.com, of course, is a place that you can actually go up to the website, find,
[01:18:48.120 --> 01:18:52.240]   you know, how much your item is worth and sell it.
[01:18:52.240 --> 01:18:53.240]   And they'll send you a little box.
[01:18:53.240 --> 01:18:54.240]   It comes in the little box.
[01:18:54.240 --> 01:18:55.240]   Have you done it yet?
[01:18:55.240 --> 01:18:58.520]   So we have, we have this little area that we've been piling stuff up.
[01:18:58.520 --> 01:18:59.520]   I know that area.
[01:18:59.520 --> 01:19:04.240]   I think actually my first experiment, this is probably a good place to talk about it.
[01:19:04.240 --> 01:19:09.720]   My first experiment with gazelle is most likely going to be my, it's leaning towards being,
[01:19:09.720 --> 01:19:12.880]   you know, what do you call it?
[01:19:12.880 --> 01:19:14.880]   My Microsoft little player.
[01:19:14.880 --> 01:19:15.880]   What's it?
[01:19:15.880 --> 01:19:16.880]   My zoom?
[01:19:16.880 --> 01:19:17.880]   Yeah.
[01:19:17.880 --> 01:19:18.880]   I always zoom back.
[01:19:18.880 --> 01:19:23.960]   You know, if I have, if that zoom tells me I can't play songs because I haven't, because
[01:19:23.960 --> 01:19:25.920]   I got to sign in one more time.
[01:19:25.920 --> 01:19:26.920]   Done.
[01:19:26.920 --> 01:19:27.920]   That's all I'm saying.
[01:19:27.920 --> 01:19:30.960]   I'm done because the problem is I end up on a plane and I go, oh, I've got all this
[01:19:30.960 --> 01:19:33.480]   music that I didn't have on my iPhone.
[01:19:33.480 --> 01:19:38.720]   And then I, and then I can't sink or I have to pay $14 or $5 or whatever to sink on it
[01:19:38.720 --> 01:19:41.560]   on the plane just so I could go back to listening to it.
[01:19:41.560 --> 01:19:44.640]   I'm just like, eh, so, and I've gotten caught.
[01:19:44.640 --> 01:19:46.880]   You know, it just seems like every single time.
[01:19:46.880 --> 01:19:50.380]   Like every, every month I'm, I'm disconnected for some reason when it decided I needed to
[01:19:50.380 --> 01:19:51.720]   check in.
[01:19:51.720 --> 01:19:57.520]   And, and so the, the wonders of a subscription service started to wear off quickly.
[01:19:57.520 --> 01:20:00.640]   And I find that I just, you know, cause all I use it for really is my music player.
[01:20:00.640 --> 01:20:02.120]   And so anyway, decided it doesn't work.
[01:20:02.120 --> 01:20:05.640]   And so I've decided that gazelle, it's $105.
[01:20:05.640 --> 01:20:06.640]   That's what it's worth.
[01:20:06.640 --> 01:20:09.360]   Cause I got all the, I got all the cables and it's in good condition because I didn't use
[01:20:09.360 --> 01:20:10.760]   it very much.
[01:20:10.760 --> 01:20:12.560]   And, and so, gazelle is it.
[01:20:12.560 --> 01:20:16.480]   But here's the thing is that whether it's a smartphone or MP3 player, laptops, game,
[01:20:16.480 --> 01:20:20.200]   consoles, any of these gadgets that you have laying around and they're, they're building
[01:20:20.200 --> 01:20:23.600]   up, you know, you're doing your house cleaning and you go, you know, find out how much is
[01:20:23.600 --> 01:20:26.240]   worth, you know, find out and, and they'll take them.
[01:20:26.240 --> 01:20:29.160]   And if they, if they're not worth anything, they'll, if they get them and they're not
[01:20:29.160 --> 01:20:31.960]   worth anything or they're not, or they're not going to resell them, they're going to
[01:20:31.960 --> 01:20:36.200]   recycle them for you in a, in a responsible way.
[01:20:36.200 --> 01:20:38.440]   And you know, there's, you know, there's 20 categories.
[01:20:38.440 --> 01:20:41.440]   There's 200,000 unique items that you can, you can test.
[01:20:41.440 --> 01:20:46.000]   You can look at a cool little graph that tells you whether you're, you know, what, you know,
[01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:49.240]   the trajectory of your, of what you're going to get for it and when you should jump off
[01:20:49.240 --> 01:20:50.480]   the ship.
[01:20:50.480 --> 01:20:54.360]   And, and so it's just a great, you know, makes it super easy to get rid of these electronics
[01:20:54.360 --> 01:20:56.720]   and get a little money back so you can go buy something new.
[01:20:56.720 --> 01:21:00.720]   So definitely check it out gazelle.com and it's really just a great marketplace where
[01:21:00.720 --> 01:21:01.720]   you don't have to worry about the marketplace.
[01:21:01.720 --> 01:21:06.440]   I mean, a lot of people, you know, deal with eBay.
[01:21:06.440 --> 01:21:07.440]   It's just too much trouble.
[01:21:07.440 --> 01:21:08.440]   I can't deal with eBay.
[01:21:08.440 --> 01:21:11.000]   And I just don't, I don't want to try to figure out how to resell this stuff.
[01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:13.000]   You gotta take it to the place.
[01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:16.480]   I have to, you know, yeah, talk to people.
[01:21:16.480 --> 01:21:19.320]   I just want to go up online has to have a box show up and put it in there.
[01:21:19.320 --> 01:21:23.720]   It's like that interaction with carbon based life forms is just, I don't like that.
[01:21:23.720 --> 01:21:28.280]   Here's the deal is I like to, I like to interact with carbon based life forms when I get to
[01:21:28.280 --> 01:21:29.480]   choose to do it.
[01:21:29.480 --> 01:21:33.000]   But just to simply get rid of my electronics, I don't really feel like I need to interact
[01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:34.240]   with carbon based life forms.
[01:21:34.240 --> 01:21:35.240]   That's all I'm saying.
[01:21:35.240 --> 01:21:38.280]   I would prefer to deal with, you know, the cloud.
[01:21:38.280 --> 01:21:39.280]   It's so it's fluffy.
[01:21:39.280 --> 01:21:40.280]   It's nice.
[01:21:40.280 --> 01:21:43.280]   It's kind of carbon.
[01:21:43.280 --> 01:21:47.600]   Anyway, so if you want to get five more percent for what you're, what you're getting from
[01:21:47.600 --> 01:21:52.200]   gazelle.com use Mac break to, I don't know why it's Mac break to, but anyway, Mac break,
[01:21:52.200 --> 01:21:57.800]   the number two is your offer code and you'll get 5% more than you would have gotten.
[01:21:57.800 --> 01:22:03.720]   So definitely, definitely check that out gazelle.com and just gazelle it.
[01:22:03.720 --> 01:22:04.720]   Gazelle it.
[01:22:04.720 --> 01:22:06.840]   I like that.
[01:22:06.840 --> 01:22:09.640]   But you've been preparing rhetoric.
[01:22:09.640 --> 01:22:10.640]   I get to go first.
[01:22:10.640 --> 01:22:11.640]   You get to go first.
[01:22:11.640 --> 01:22:12.640]   What's your pick of the week?
[01:22:12.640 --> 01:22:13.640]   All right.
[01:22:13.640 --> 01:22:18.960]   Because I'm hosting this week in photo, my pick is photography related and it is this
[01:22:18.960 --> 01:22:20.560]   new site that came across my desk.
[01:22:20.560 --> 01:22:21.840]   Somebody emailed this to me actually.
[01:22:21.840 --> 01:22:23.960]   It's called Yoghly.
[01:22:23.960 --> 01:22:24.960]   Yoghile.
[01:22:24.960 --> 01:22:25.960]   Y-O-G-I-L-E.com.
[01:22:25.960 --> 01:22:26.960]   Y-O-G-I-L-E.com.
[01:22:26.960 --> 01:22:33.160]   And what it is, it's a photo sharing site.
[01:22:33.160 --> 01:22:34.160]   So I use Flickr.
[01:22:34.160 --> 01:22:35.160]   I use smug mug.
[01:22:35.160 --> 01:22:36.160]   I use all those.
[01:22:36.160 --> 01:22:37.160]   I use them all.
[01:22:37.160 --> 01:22:38.160]   Yeah.
[01:22:38.160 --> 01:22:40.440]   And they're all great for their unique purposes.
[01:22:40.440 --> 01:22:43.280]   But this one kind of flips it a little bit and allows others.
[01:22:43.280 --> 01:22:44.680]   It's basically group sharing.
[01:22:44.680 --> 01:22:50.680]   So you could have a group of people that you allow access to to upload into this one area.
[01:22:50.680 --> 01:22:51.680]   Love it.
[01:22:51.680 --> 01:22:52.680]   And you curated.
[01:22:52.680 --> 01:22:55.960]   You can't even do that with iPhoto and Flickr.
[01:22:55.960 --> 01:22:57.200]   You can, but not like this.
[01:22:57.200 --> 01:22:58.200]   This is a cloud.
[01:22:58.200 --> 01:22:59.200]   This is a cloud-based service.
[01:22:59.200 --> 01:23:00.200]   Right.
[01:23:00.200 --> 01:23:01.200]   You know, where you log in.
[01:23:01.200 --> 01:23:02.200]   You get a username and password.
[01:23:02.200 --> 01:23:03.200]   It is free.
[01:23:03.200 --> 01:23:04.200]   You know.
[01:23:04.200 --> 01:23:06.920]   Let me see some of the features they have on here.
[01:23:06.920 --> 01:23:12.480]   They say they let multiple people contribute with ease, add photos as email attachments.
[01:23:12.480 --> 01:23:15.720]   So you get an email address where people can just, hey, shoot a photo in here so you can
[01:23:15.720 --> 01:23:18.360]   shoot it from your phone or whatever.
[01:23:18.360 --> 01:23:21.720]   Customizable URLs, which is cool.
[01:23:21.720 --> 01:23:25.120]   And this is a cool piece that I was like, oh, really cool.
[01:23:25.120 --> 01:23:27.240]   No need for users to register.
[01:23:27.240 --> 01:23:28.840]   So you set this thing up.
[01:23:28.840 --> 01:23:29.840]   Y-O-G-I-L-E.
[01:23:29.840 --> 01:23:35.720]   So you set it up, give people an email address to send to and suddenly people can send.
[01:23:35.720 --> 01:23:36.960]   So you throw in a party or something.
[01:23:36.960 --> 01:23:39.800]   You say, hey, everybody, you're taking all these camera phone pictures.
[01:23:39.800 --> 01:23:44.160]   Make sure you send them to this link or to this URL or to this email address and they
[01:23:44.160 --> 01:23:46.000]   automatically show up in your album.
[01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:47.000]   Just like that.
[01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:48.000]   That's cool.
[01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:51.760]   I mean, it seems like the kind of thing that you can almost do now, but not as easily.
[01:23:51.760 --> 01:23:56.600]   And I think that it's a, I know that like when you're at a concert or at a big event,
[01:23:56.600 --> 01:23:59.320]   these are the kind of things that would be really cool to have a nice customer.
[01:23:59.320 --> 01:24:01.120]   You know, it's brain dead simple to set up.
[01:24:01.120 --> 01:24:02.120]   You just set it up and go.
[01:24:02.120 --> 01:24:06.480]   You've got three fields on the front page, you know, your email, your password and the
[01:24:06.480 --> 01:24:08.560]   album password and you're done.
[01:24:08.560 --> 01:24:09.560]   You're off and running.
[01:24:09.560 --> 01:24:10.560]   Yo, Gile.
[01:24:10.560 --> 01:24:14.960]   Yo, Gile, Yowgli, maybe the CEO or whoever can reach out.
[01:24:14.960 --> 01:24:15.960]   Let's know what it is.
[01:24:15.960 --> 01:24:18.720]   How you pronounce your name.
[01:24:18.720 --> 01:24:20.720]   But it's y-o-g-i-l-e.com.
[01:24:20.720 --> 01:24:22.720]   Check it out.
[01:24:22.720 --> 01:24:25.880]   And we can test everybody's, we can test their servers right now by just telling everybody
[01:24:25.880 --> 01:24:27.080]   who's listening right now.
[01:24:27.080 --> 01:24:28.080]   We should test it right now.
[01:24:28.080 --> 01:24:29.080]   Go there.
[01:24:29.080 --> 01:24:33.720]   We can photo and set it up and say, everybody that listens submit to this one account.
[01:24:33.720 --> 01:24:34.720]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:24:34.720 --> 01:24:35.720]   See how many it can handle.
[01:24:35.720 --> 01:24:36.720]   Exactly.
[01:24:36.720 --> 01:24:37.720]   Exactly.
[01:24:37.720 --> 01:24:38.960]   So anyway, we'll test that in your future.
[01:24:38.960 --> 01:24:41.440]   Andy, what's your pick of the week?
[01:24:41.440 --> 01:24:46.840]   My pick of the week is a really cool like DIY project called the Minty Boost.
[01:24:46.840 --> 01:24:58.720]   If you go to ladyada.net, l-a-d-y-a-d-a.net, it is a, it is a iPhone/ipod recharger/booster
[01:24:58.720 --> 01:25:03.480]   that you just pop a couple of AA batteries and even the brand new Apple rechargeable
[01:25:03.480 --> 01:25:04.480]   AA batteries.
[01:25:04.480 --> 01:25:11.680]   And you can cook, hook up any USB device into the USB port and you will get about a half
[01:25:11.680 --> 01:25:14.600]   again another charge to your, to your iPhone.
[01:25:14.600 --> 01:25:17.080]   They've just updated it to work with the iPhone 4.
[01:25:17.080 --> 01:25:22.040]   Now, the cool thing about it is that it is like an open source like project.
[01:25:22.040 --> 01:25:24.840]   This is the Minty Boost right here.
[01:25:24.840 --> 01:25:30.360]   It is a package of components that you then simply solder together.
[01:25:30.360 --> 01:25:33.160]   It has a little, little circuit board and all the parts you need.
[01:25:33.160 --> 01:25:35.100]   Here's the, here's the battery holder.
[01:25:35.100 --> 01:25:36.100]   Here's the IC.
[01:25:36.100 --> 01:25:38.200]   It's about, it's a really simple electronics kit.
[01:25:38.200 --> 01:25:44.640]   It's about maybe a dozen, dozen and a half, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, joints, uh, connections
[01:25:44.640 --> 01:25:46.040]   to make a, uh, uh, all along.
[01:25:46.040 --> 01:25:48.900]   So it's not like you're building like an entire computer here.
[01:25:48.900 --> 01:25:52.100]   Uh, and it's designed so that it will fit inside a Mints container.
[01:25:52.100 --> 01:25:56.340]   Uh, it is designed specifically to fit within an Altoids box.
[01:25:56.340 --> 01:26:01.420]   Uh, so not the, not the regular sort of Altoids, but like the, the Altoids gum box.
[01:26:01.420 --> 01:26:07.340]   Uh, if you go to a lady at net slash make slash Minty Boost, you'll actually see it like
[01:26:07.340 --> 01:26:12.820]   actually beautifully laid out with batteries and everything with a USB connector, uh, tucked
[01:26:12.820 --> 01:26:13.820]   into it.
[01:26:13.820 --> 01:26:15.740]   Um, I love it for a bunch of different reasons.
[01:26:15.740 --> 01:26:20.380]   Number one, they put, they posted, I really, I bought it chiefly to reward them for this
[01:26:20.380 --> 01:26:24.980]   really awesome video they posted because, uh, they had a sort of reverse engineer how
[01:26:24.980 --> 01:26:30.300]   the USB, how USB charging works in the iPhone because, uh, they're really simple charges
[01:26:30.300 --> 01:26:31.300]   like this.
[01:26:31.300 --> 01:26:35.420]   They just simply put power on these two pins of the USB port, uh, of the USB connector
[01:26:35.420 --> 01:26:36.700]   that's supposed to charge it.
[01:26:36.700 --> 01:26:40.180]   What they had to do was really start to scope out what this connector does and they figured
[01:26:40.180 --> 01:26:44.220]   out that you need to have a resistor across two separate pins to tell the iPhone.
[01:26:44.220 --> 01:26:47.020]   Yes, I definitely want you to charge off charge off of this.
[01:26:47.020 --> 01:26:48.020]   Do a quick charge.
[01:26:48.020 --> 01:26:49.580]   Do a, do a slow charge.
[01:26:49.580 --> 01:26:55.500]   Um, and it's such a really wonderfully done video, uh, of how you reverse engineer anything
[01:26:55.500 --> 01:26:58.340]   that I thought was really, I thought was really cool.
[01:26:58.340 --> 01:27:03.540]   Secondly, what I like about this project is that if you're at my level of like electronics
[01:27:03.540 --> 01:27:09.180]   expertise, uh, I, I could not design this circuit, but if you give me the components
[01:27:09.180 --> 01:27:13.100]   for the circuit, I can then bend it and make it do what I wanted to do immediately.
[01:27:13.100 --> 01:27:14.260]   I thought, well, that's cool.
[01:27:14.260 --> 01:27:19.260]   But when I really, that's supposed, suppose this will give you about an extra 50% of a
[01:27:19.260 --> 01:27:23.620]   battery life on your iPhone for, uh, excuse me, on your, on your iPhone.
[01:27:23.620 --> 01:27:27.300]   Uh, and I'm thinking, well, geez, you know, then there's really nothing stopping me from,
[01:27:27.300 --> 01:27:28.460]   that's a two double A solution.
[01:27:28.460 --> 01:27:33.340]   I could just simply put in another battery bank of two batteries, wire them in parallel,
[01:27:33.340 --> 01:27:37.460]   drop in a diode to prevent these, uh, batteries from charging each other and exploding.
[01:27:37.460 --> 01:27:41.140]   And I would have double the amperage and double the, the, the charge capacity.
[01:27:41.140 --> 01:27:44.180]   And then you can also think, yeah, but what if I, gee, how, I got these like old lap
[01:27:44.180 --> 01:27:45.180]   top batteries.
[01:27:45.180 --> 01:27:48.860]   So what if I got like an old laptop batter for my Dell with those huge ultra capacity?
[01:27:48.860 --> 01:27:51.020]   Uh, and it's, it's a completely open source thing.
[01:27:51.020 --> 01:27:54.820]   So it was, so the instructions tell you exactly how it was designed and what it needs.
[01:27:54.820 --> 01:27:58.300]   As long as you have hooked up to a power source that will give it less than five volts.
[01:27:58.300 --> 01:28:01.460]   Uh, it will, you can essentially turn wherever you want into a charger.
[01:28:01.460 --> 01:28:05.460]   Uh, so I haven't actually built mine yet chiefly because I keep waffling on what kind
[01:28:05.460 --> 01:28:07.140]   of container I want to install it in.
[01:28:07.140 --> 01:28:11.380]   I actually wanted, this is a mentos, this is actually a mentos container, uh, that I
[01:28:11.380 --> 01:28:15.100]   decided that I actually discovered thing only pour out the gum.
[01:28:15.100 --> 01:28:18.700]   Another problem is that I have to eat all the gum, uh, before I can like actually build
[01:28:18.700 --> 01:28:19.700]   this.
[01:28:19.700 --> 01:28:20.700]   There's always that.
[01:28:20.700 --> 01:28:21.700]   Exactly.
[01:28:21.700 --> 01:28:23.180]   It's, it's a nice hard plastic container.
[01:28:23.180 --> 01:28:26.180]   And then I noticed that the battery pack slips nicely inside.
[01:28:26.180 --> 01:28:27.900]   There's like a glove.
[01:28:27.900 --> 01:28:33.060]   Unfortunately, I have to saw, I had a saw off like the very, very top of it because the
[01:28:33.060 --> 01:28:38.020]   top of it is like a little bit narrowed, uh, so that the, the, this fitted cap can fit
[01:28:38.020 --> 01:28:39.020]   on top of it.
[01:28:39.020 --> 01:28:40.020]   And I'm like, well, that's okay.
[01:28:40.020 --> 01:28:43.500]   I'll just like get two of these and sort of like put a seam on one of them.
[01:28:43.500 --> 01:28:45.380]   He trinked them together and glued them together.
[01:28:45.380 --> 01:28:47.820]   So one will, one will be capped for battery sled.
[01:28:47.820 --> 01:28:49.900]   The other one will be capped for the USB connector.
[01:28:49.900 --> 01:28:54.460]   Uh, so it's a very, it's a cheap kit, 20 bucks if you want them to send you everything
[01:28:54.460 --> 01:28:55.460]   that you need.
[01:28:55.460 --> 01:28:59.260]   Uh, and it will give you, it's like buying one of those model kits when you're a kid.
[01:28:59.260 --> 01:29:02.180]   Part of the fun is following the directions and part of the fun is, yeah, but what if
[01:29:02.180 --> 01:29:06.020]   I don't want this to be a world war two fighter jet fighter plane?
[01:29:06.020 --> 01:29:10.300]   What if I want this to be like a millennium Falcon style one of the start like replacing
[01:29:10.300 --> 01:29:12.660]   the wings and putting different decals on.
[01:29:12.660 --> 01:29:16.820]   And so at the end, sometime in the next three years, when I finally decide what kind of power
[01:29:16.820 --> 01:29:21.940]   source I want, what I want to build it inside, whether I want to put a solar panel and a
[01:29:21.940 --> 01:29:23.420]   wind propeller on it.
[01:29:23.420 --> 01:29:26.700]   Uh, I'll, I'll wind up building this, but it's, it's a, it's a fun little project.
[01:29:26.700 --> 01:29:29.860]   I think it's well within the capacities of anybody who can operate a soldering iron,
[01:29:29.860 --> 01:29:33.900]   uh, as 20 bucks and you're supporting some really cool people, I think I, I, the video
[01:29:33.900 --> 01:29:37.820]   is, as someone who has to build a lot of these videos, the video is just stellar.
[01:29:37.820 --> 01:29:38.820]   Absolutely.
[01:29:38.820 --> 01:29:40.220]   I, I, I have to see it.
[01:29:40.220 --> 01:29:41.220]   Yeah.
[01:29:41.220 --> 01:29:42.220]   I tweeted about it.
[01:29:42.220 --> 01:29:43.220]   That's how I saw it.
[01:29:43.220 --> 01:29:46.460]   This is, this is exactly how you should demonstrate technology on any subject.
[01:29:46.460 --> 01:29:47.620]   It doesn't matter what it is.
[01:29:47.620 --> 01:29:48.620]   I'm sorry.
[01:29:48.620 --> 01:29:52.020]   I'll expect to don don is actually every single video he does is he has how to demonstrate
[01:29:52.020 --> 01:29:56.780]   technology, but I've never seen something as complicated as we have no idea why this
[01:29:56.780 --> 01:29:58.420]   is not charging properly.
[01:29:58.420 --> 01:30:01.940]   So we are first going to put attached this to a scope to try to figure out exactly what
[01:30:01.940 --> 01:30:04.660]   the current drain is on this and various charging modes.
[01:30:04.660 --> 01:30:08.860]   And now here is how we operate this disassembly tool that will apply gentle heat to the service
[01:30:08.860 --> 01:30:09.860]   way.
[01:30:09.860 --> 01:30:10.860]   I need one of those.
[01:30:10.860 --> 01:30:11.860]   I need one.
[01:30:11.860 --> 01:30:15.940]   And so the little tweezers getting this tiny half of a grain of rice size resistor and
[01:30:15.940 --> 01:30:18.900]   then figuring out like what kind of resistance values that it's popping out.
[01:30:18.900 --> 01:30:21.860]   And I'm like, oh, that's one of the best.
[01:30:21.860 --> 01:30:23.500]   You can keep your cat playing the piano.
[01:30:23.500 --> 01:30:26.780]   You can keep the college kids skateboarding and get hit in the nuts.
[01:30:26.780 --> 01:30:28.500]   That's entertaining as it is.
[01:30:28.500 --> 01:30:33.260]   That's the lady out of video is exactly what I like to watch.
[01:30:33.260 --> 01:30:36.660]   And I think that that's actually a great when we talk about content.
[01:30:36.660 --> 01:30:42.460]   That's how you develop a following that will buy anything that you're making based on just
[01:30:42.460 --> 01:30:43.460]   the content.
[01:30:43.460 --> 01:30:46.980]   You know, like when we first started DB Garage and I was doing these little training tutorials
[01:30:46.980 --> 01:30:51.260]   or whatever, we got a lot of people who bought from us just to make sure we kept on making
[01:30:51.260 --> 01:30:54.060]   the training videos, you know, and in the same way, you know, you know, you know, they
[01:30:54.060 --> 01:30:57.460]   were like, well, I don't really need this, but I'm going to buy it because donation,
[01:30:57.460 --> 01:31:00.820]   you know, it's just just think of it as a donation because there's no donation box on
[01:31:00.820 --> 01:31:01.820]   your website.
[01:31:01.820 --> 01:31:04.420]   And I need to give you some money to keep on doing that.
[01:31:04.420 --> 01:31:08.740]   But these, this video was not only really interesting, but it was well shot.
[01:31:08.740 --> 01:31:09.820]   It was well organized.
[01:31:09.820 --> 01:31:11.260]   It was a thought process.
[01:31:11.260 --> 01:31:12.260]   And yeah, I picked it up.
[01:31:12.260 --> 01:31:14.460]   I saw it on your Twitter feed and that's how I found it.
[01:31:14.460 --> 01:31:16.260]   And it was, uh, it was really great.
[01:31:16.260 --> 01:31:18.300]   So definitely worth checking out Don.
[01:31:18.300 --> 01:31:20.420]   And that's, and by the way, it's it's lady.
[01:31:20.420 --> 01:31:21.420]   Adah.
[01:31:21.420 --> 01:31:22.420]   Right.
[01:31:22.420 --> 01:31:23.420]   Is that right?
[01:31:23.420 --> 01:31:24.420]   Lady.
[01:31:24.420 --> 01:31:25.420]   Lady.
[01:31:25.420 --> 01:31:26.420]   A.
[01:31:26.420 --> 01:31:28.460]   So, uh, definitely check out.
[01:31:28.460 --> 01:31:29.620]   There's a lot of other stuff on it.
[01:31:29.620 --> 01:31:30.620]   It's a great website.
[01:31:30.620 --> 01:31:31.620]   So, so definitely check out the website.
[01:31:31.620 --> 01:31:33.700]   I'm not the last project I'm going to buy from them.
[01:31:33.700 --> 01:31:37.580]   It's like these little electronic projects, especially things I can make me think that
[01:31:37.580 --> 01:31:38.940]   I know about electronics as well.
[01:31:38.940 --> 01:31:42.940]   Of course it was just a two double a charger, but I'm the one who decided to put a lantern
[01:31:42.940 --> 01:31:44.300]   battery on it and I blew it up.
[01:31:44.300 --> 01:31:46.060]   But the second one I also blow up.
[01:31:46.060 --> 01:31:48.860]   But the third one I built and I didn't really need that iPhone.
[01:31:48.860 --> 01:31:52.100]   So, you know, I probably should have put a diet there.
[01:31:52.100 --> 01:31:55.020]   So, so, but anyway, but, but it starts you off on rails.
[01:31:55.020 --> 01:31:58.140]   So you, so that, and then, and then after that, you kind of blow out.
[01:31:58.140 --> 01:32:01.660]   So, you've just identified the reason why eight years ago I learned that just because
[01:32:01.660 --> 01:32:04.860]   you could hook up two batteries in parallel and double the average doesn't mean that you
[01:32:04.860 --> 01:32:06.700]   could just simply drop that into any circuit.
[01:32:06.700 --> 01:32:07.700]   That's what I learned about.
[01:32:07.700 --> 01:32:08.700]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:32:08.700 --> 01:32:09.700]   Exactly.
[01:32:09.700 --> 01:32:11.700]   So, John, you're up.
[01:32:11.700 --> 01:32:12.700]   Right.
[01:32:12.700 --> 01:32:14.540]   Actually, yeah, I have to say, Andy, I watched the video as well.
[01:32:14.540 --> 01:32:18.060]   And I actually nearly stole one technique, which was to, uh, the way she actually wrote
[01:32:18.060 --> 01:32:21.500]   with a Sharpie on it, just simply for paths and sketched out.
[01:32:21.500 --> 01:32:22.500]   I thought it was brilliant.
[01:32:22.500 --> 01:32:24.860]   I thought, how can you use that until I realized I couldn't draw.
[01:32:24.860 --> 01:32:28.740]   And then, so that went back to, you know, to never mind, I must practice my drawing.
[01:32:28.740 --> 01:32:30.100]   But anyway, but I want my tip.
[01:32:30.100 --> 01:32:31.100]   Okay.
[01:32:31.100 --> 01:32:33.260]   My pick for this week, it's a very, very simple one, actually.
[01:32:33.260 --> 01:32:36.300]   It's to do with, again, we've talked a lot about the cloud and a lot about sharing files
[01:32:36.300 --> 01:32:37.300]   this week.
[01:32:37.300 --> 01:32:43.380]   And this is a very, very simple application called, uh, we can get it at getcloudapp.com.
[01:32:43.380 --> 01:32:45.580]   It's actually called cloud app.
[01:32:45.580 --> 01:32:46.580]   And it's very simple.
[01:32:46.580 --> 01:32:48.620]   It's based on Amazon S3, which is the backend storage.
[01:32:48.620 --> 01:32:52.140]   So, you know, you've got super, super efficient, super secure storage.
[01:32:52.140 --> 01:32:54.460]   But it's really meant for public sharing of files.
[01:32:54.460 --> 01:32:58.260]   So if you want to share a file and then send someone a link on Twitter or in an email,
[01:32:58.260 --> 01:33:03.260]   basically, all you do is drag, you install cloud app and install the application.
[01:33:03.260 --> 01:33:05.780]   It installs a menu bar item in your menu bar.
[01:33:05.780 --> 01:33:09.620]   And to share the file, all you do basically is just drag the file from the finder and
[01:33:09.620 --> 01:33:11.300]   drop it on the menu bar icon.
[01:33:11.300 --> 01:33:13.420]   It uploads it automatically in the background.
[01:33:13.420 --> 01:33:16.260]   And then if you have ground enabled, it will give you a ground message to let you know
[01:33:16.260 --> 01:33:17.260]   that it's done.
[01:33:17.260 --> 01:33:20.660]   And then it pastes a link into your, you know, into your buffer.
[01:33:20.660 --> 01:33:24.060]   So you can just copy the link straight into a tweet or into an email.
[01:33:24.060 --> 01:33:27.900]   Now, it sounds very simple, but it works very effectively.
[01:33:27.900 --> 01:33:30.540]   And you know, if you just want to share something quickly, it's very easy just to drag something
[01:33:30.540 --> 01:33:32.620]   up into the menu bar and boom, it's done.
[01:33:32.620 --> 01:33:34.780]   You know, it's automatically shared.
[01:33:34.780 --> 01:33:37.940]   You can create, I mean, it's meant for public use.
[01:33:37.940 --> 01:33:41.940]   So you don't really recommend it to put any sort of secure, any personal information up
[01:33:41.940 --> 01:33:42.940]   there.
[01:33:42.940 --> 01:33:45.140]   But if you want to share something with a group of people, it's very easy to do.
[01:33:45.140 --> 01:33:50.020]   You can get sort of, sort of, extra long shortened URLs to the link.
[01:33:50.020 --> 01:33:52.700]   You can switch on that privacy setting that gives you that.
[01:33:52.700 --> 01:33:55.580]   But it also does things such as it gives you a web interface as well.
[01:33:55.580 --> 01:33:59.900]   You can actually see from the menu bar item what files you've shared, how many people
[01:33:59.900 --> 01:34:00.900]   have downloaded them.
[01:34:00.900 --> 01:34:02.420]   You can get the links again.
[01:34:02.420 --> 01:34:03.660]   That's all very neat.
[01:34:03.660 --> 01:34:06.100]   You can also go to a web interface, what gives you more information.
[01:34:06.100 --> 01:34:11.340]   It breaks down the types of files that got uploaded, such as images, zip files, audio
[01:34:11.340 --> 01:34:12.340]   files, movie files.
[01:34:12.340 --> 01:34:17.860]   I mean, I sent, I did a quick test demo of an iPhone movie file that I got from the
[01:34:17.860 --> 01:34:21.300]   iPhone and posted it using the same service a couple of days ago.
[01:34:21.300 --> 01:34:24.180]   I've just looked now and there's like 500 people have actually downloaded it and taken
[01:34:24.180 --> 01:34:25.180]   a look at that movie file.
[01:34:25.180 --> 01:34:27.180]   How much is the price?
[01:34:27.180 --> 01:34:28.900]   How does this work?
[01:34:28.900 --> 01:34:29.900]   It's free at the moment.
[01:34:29.900 --> 01:34:32.900]   There is some discussion on the forums.
[01:34:32.900 --> 01:34:36.460]   They seem to be a little bit slower in producing a pricing structure.
[01:34:36.460 --> 01:34:40.620]   But it's a free service that always will be a free component where I think the model
[01:34:40.620 --> 01:34:45.020]   they're going to use is to use a premium service later on when they once that out of
[01:34:45.020 --> 01:34:46.020]   the stage.
[01:34:46.020 --> 01:34:48.860]   They'll introduce pretty much pretty similar to Dropbox.
[01:34:48.860 --> 01:34:53.180]   You can get a Dropbox account of 2Gig for free.
[01:34:53.180 --> 01:34:55.140]   But if you want more than that, you can pay a premium.
[01:34:55.140 --> 01:34:56.900]   Is there any lemon on this one right now?
[01:34:56.900 --> 01:34:59.260]   No, at the moment, there isn't.
[01:34:59.260 --> 01:35:01.260]   Not the right.
[01:35:01.260 --> 01:35:05.940]   Well, there wasn't an up until today anyway.
[01:35:05.940 --> 01:35:06.940]   Yes, exactly.
[01:35:06.940 --> 01:35:09.660]   Don't remember that Drobo and the cloud you were talking about?
[01:35:09.660 --> 01:35:11.620]   There it is.
[01:35:11.620 --> 01:35:14.580]   I will show you how to use bandwidth.
[01:35:14.580 --> 01:35:17.740]   It's a really neat service.
[01:35:17.740 --> 01:35:18.740]   The web interface is very simple.
[01:35:18.740 --> 01:35:20.980]   You can also do things called raindrops.
[01:35:20.980 --> 01:35:22.780]   It's called the cloud app.
[01:35:22.780 --> 01:35:23.780]   You can get raindrops.
[01:35:23.780 --> 01:35:30.980]   Raindrops are basically short plugins that allow you to send files directly from an application.
[01:35:30.980 --> 01:35:35.100]   By default, there's a keystroke that will allow you to just highlight the file in the
[01:35:35.100 --> 01:35:36.100]   Finder.
[01:35:36.100 --> 01:35:39.980]   Hit the keystroke and that will upload it to CloudApp and then paste the link into your
[01:35:39.980 --> 01:35:40.980]   buffer.
[01:35:40.980 --> 01:35:42.460]   But there's things for aperture.
[01:35:42.460 --> 01:35:45.260]   There's an iPhoto one as well.
[01:35:45.260 --> 01:35:47.820]   Directly from these applications, if you want to share something, you can do it from
[01:35:47.820 --> 01:35:50.420]   within the application using a hot key.
[01:35:50.420 --> 01:35:51.420]   Fantastic.
[01:35:51.420 --> 01:35:52.620]   Yes, it's a very nice application.
[01:35:52.620 --> 01:35:53.860]   I say it's free.
[01:35:53.860 --> 01:35:54.940]   No limits at the moment.
[01:35:54.940 --> 01:35:57.540]   They will probably introduce a premium service later on.
[01:35:57.540 --> 01:36:01.340]   But if you want to go on and give it a try, it's a really nice application.
[01:36:01.340 --> 01:36:02.340]   Fantastic.
[01:36:02.340 --> 01:36:04.140]   I will definitely check it out.
[01:36:04.140 --> 01:36:05.140]   It's good enough.
[01:36:05.140 --> 01:36:09.980]   I think I might kick the tires and test how much weight did that.
[01:36:09.980 --> 01:36:14.780]   Anybody who's watching or listening to this right now, try it before Alex gets on.
[01:36:14.780 --> 01:36:16.780]   He's going to bring it to you.
[01:36:16.780 --> 01:36:20.460]   Let's see how before they change all the rules.
[01:36:20.460 --> 01:36:23.860]   I was the kid in the playground where they start adding rules to dodgeball or adding
[01:36:23.860 --> 01:36:29.100]   rules because I figured out some way to manipulate the rules that they had.
[01:36:29.100 --> 01:36:31.460]   Try to aim below the neck, Alex.
[01:36:31.460 --> 01:36:37.420]   No, there's always in many background rules, there's oftentimes ways that if you stand
[01:36:37.420 --> 01:36:44.020]   in just a certain place, it's not necessarily fair, but it's not against the rules.
[01:36:44.020 --> 01:36:46.580]   The key is knowing how to find those.
[01:36:46.580 --> 01:36:48.420]   Anyway, here's my pick.
[01:36:48.420 --> 01:36:54.580]   Hold on, I'll play it for you.
[01:36:54.580 --> 01:36:55.580]   How's that?
[01:36:55.580 --> 01:36:56.580]   What is it?
[01:36:56.580 --> 01:36:57.580]   Hold on.
[01:36:57.580 --> 01:36:58.580]   Awesome.
[01:36:58.580 --> 01:36:59.580]   I'll give you $50 for it right now.
[01:36:59.580 --> 01:37:00.580]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:37:00.580 --> 01:37:01.580]   Hold on.
[01:37:01.580 --> 01:37:02.580]   Let me return to main menu.
[01:37:02.580 --> 01:37:03.580]   Hold on.
[01:37:03.580 --> 01:37:04.580]   You did it to me.
[01:37:04.580 --> 01:37:05.580]   Okay, hold on.
[01:37:05.580 --> 01:37:10.580]   I am.
[01:37:10.580 --> 01:37:11.580]   That's Sam.
[01:37:11.580 --> 01:37:12.580]   I am.
[01:37:12.580 --> 01:37:13.580]   That's Sam.
[01:37:13.580 --> 01:37:14.580]   I am.
[01:37:14.580 --> 01:37:16.580]   I do not like that.
[01:37:16.580 --> 01:37:18.860]   Sam, I am Dr. Seuss.
[01:37:18.860 --> 01:37:21.780]   This is my favorite Dr. Seuss book and I had to take it.
[01:37:21.780 --> 01:37:22.780]   It is it is.
[01:37:22.780 --> 01:37:23.780]   I love it.
[01:37:23.780 --> 01:37:25.780]   It's in him.
[01:37:25.780 --> 01:37:30.420]   So anyway, it is now available on my iPhone and on the iPad and the way that they've been
[01:37:30.420 --> 01:37:31.420]   implemented.
[01:37:31.420 --> 01:37:33.420]   I don't know if I've if I picked any of these before.
[01:37:33.420 --> 01:37:35.500]   I can't remember whether I've done some of the older ones.
[01:37:35.500 --> 01:37:38.940]   I'm a big Dr. Seuss fan and my son is a huge Dr. Seuss fan.
[01:37:38.940 --> 01:37:43.220]   And the way that they've implemented these is so great.
[01:37:43.220 --> 01:37:48.340]   So what they do is and this is the way I think that this is a one possible future.
[01:37:48.340 --> 01:37:55.580]   By the way, one of the things that I think is important about this is that I is that
[01:37:55.580 --> 01:38:00.540]   the thing with a lot of these applications, this is taking the books to the next level
[01:38:00.540 --> 01:38:04.180]   where I think that Amazon is going to continue to sell books to our people who really like
[01:38:04.180 --> 01:38:05.620]   the book reading experience.
[01:38:05.620 --> 01:38:08.180]   They want to read the words.
[01:38:08.180 --> 01:38:10.580]   They want to do this stuff and they don't need anything added to it.
[01:38:10.580 --> 01:38:15.980]   But what they're doing with the Dr. Seuss books, I think is just fascinating, which is
[01:38:15.980 --> 01:38:19.260]   this idea where I can go from page to page.
[01:38:19.260 --> 01:38:21.500]   It will read to me or to my son on his own.
[01:38:21.500 --> 01:38:22.500]   And you'll hear it.
[01:38:22.500 --> 01:38:26.460]   You'll hear my son open it up on the iPad and you'll hear that Sam I am.
[01:38:26.460 --> 01:38:28.940]   That's like, you know, like, and I know that he's listening to Dr. Seuss because he's,
[01:38:28.940 --> 01:38:30.100]   you know, he's watching Dr. Seuss.
[01:38:30.100 --> 01:38:32.540]   And he knows how to change the pages.
[01:38:32.540 --> 01:38:35.740]   And then when you click on stuff, let's see if I turn this on.
[01:38:35.740 --> 01:38:38.580]   If I click on something here, I go fish.
[01:38:38.580 --> 01:38:39.580]   Ew.
[01:38:39.580 --> 01:38:42.660]   So, you know, there's a little bit of, you know, a little bit of education there as far as
[01:38:42.660 --> 01:38:45.140]   Dr. Seuss takes you on education.
[01:38:45.140 --> 01:38:47.340]   And the thing is is that there's lots of push-ins.
[01:38:47.340 --> 01:38:50.580]   So it's actually, you know, it shows you part of the page and you read that and then it opens
[01:38:50.580 --> 01:38:52.660]   up and shows the rest of the page.
[01:38:52.660 --> 01:38:55.220]   And it's just really well made.
[01:38:55.220 --> 01:38:59.660]   And it's just a great solution and hope is something that I think if you have kids, these
[01:38:59.660 --> 01:39:06.180]   are, you know, this stuff is fantastic as far as bringing that night time.
[01:39:06.180 --> 01:39:10.220]   I mean, to me, I don't want to buy my wife's still buys books with paper.
[01:39:10.220 --> 01:39:12.180]   I think it's cute.
[01:39:12.180 --> 01:39:13.420]   I think it's cute.
[01:39:13.420 --> 01:39:15.300]   You know, I go, oh, can't wait.
[01:39:15.300 --> 01:39:20.980]   So anyway, so the, so anyway, so, but, you know, it's, it's fine.
[01:39:20.980 --> 01:39:24.100]   But, but, you know, I don't, you know, the idea of having all those books, especially
[01:39:24.100 --> 01:39:28.260]   when you're on the road, when you're in an airport with your kids, being able to have
[01:39:28.260 --> 01:39:32.460]   10 books that do this kind of thing that are this interactive is really great.
[01:39:32.460 --> 01:39:36.260]   And Green Eggs and Ham, in my opinion, is the best kids book ever, ever written.
[01:39:36.260 --> 01:39:39.740]   I credit it with making me want to eat Green Eggs and Ham.
[01:39:39.740 --> 01:39:40.740]   I don't know.
[01:39:40.740 --> 01:39:41.740]   Yes.
[01:39:41.740 --> 01:39:42.740]   They just make it look so good in that book.
[01:39:42.740 --> 01:39:43.740]   Yes, exactly.
[01:39:43.740 --> 01:39:44.740]   Exactly.
[01:39:44.740 --> 01:39:45.740]   Exactly.
[01:39:45.740 --> 01:39:46.740]   By the end, I've broken down.
[01:39:46.740 --> 01:39:47.740]   Okay.
[01:39:47.740 --> 01:39:48.740]   I'll have the Green Eggs and Ham.
[01:39:48.740 --> 01:39:52.580]   So, so anyway, so it is anyway, definitely it's all the Dr. Seuss ones are good, but this
[01:39:52.580 --> 01:39:55.580]   one specifically Green Eggs and Ham is my favorite.
[01:39:55.580 --> 01:39:58.460]   And I definitely would suggest checking out.
[01:39:58.460 --> 01:40:00.220]   So that's my pick of the week.
[01:40:00.220 --> 01:40:03.420]   And Don, where can people find you?
[01:40:03.420 --> 01:40:09.260]   They can find me at screencastonline.com and if I can just remind people about that 50%
[01:40:09.260 --> 01:40:13.900]   discount to for a full membership for three months plus access to the entire back catalogue
[01:40:13.900 --> 01:40:18.620]   of over 260 shows, just use the coupon code MAC break weekly.
[01:40:18.620 --> 01:40:22.100]   Actually, some people did actually sign up during the live show and had a problem, but
[01:40:22.100 --> 01:40:23.740]   I actually fixed that while I was online.
[01:40:23.740 --> 01:40:25.740]   So it's all working perfect.
[01:40:25.740 --> 01:40:26.740]   So we're good multitaskers.
[01:40:26.740 --> 01:40:32.980]   I'm actually part of just two, a few emails as well and blown people away from the looks
[01:40:32.980 --> 01:40:33.980]   of it.
[01:40:33.980 --> 01:40:34.980]   But anyway, that's all sorted.
[01:40:34.980 --> 01:40:37.460]   So yeah, MAC break weekly is the 50% discount code.
[01:40:37.460 --> 01:40:38.460]   Great.
[01:40:38.460 --> 01:40:39.900]   And Andy, where can people find you?
[01:40:39.900 --> 01:40:45.540]   Well, I've chosen a different business model than Don in which I provide information that
[01:40:45.540 --> 01:40:49.900]   is of absolutely zero value that will not help you.
[01:40:49.900 --> 01:40:53.020]   That will just waste your time, but I don't charge money for it.
[01:40:53.020 --> 01:40:56.380]   So I don't know which one is going to eke out.
[01:40:56.380 --> 01:41:00.540]   I got to admit that I really recommend people go to Don's site and not mine, but I know
[01:41:00.540 --> 01:41:02.780]   the celestial waste of Dan with CW.
[01:41:02.780 --> 01:41:04.820]   Very smart to go.
[01:41:04.820 --> 01:41:05.820]   Yes.
[01:41:05.820 --> 01:41:13.820]   When my brother was running for his fraternity, he was so popular that he won by unanimous
[01:41:13.820 --> 01:41:19.140]   vote, including the guy that ran against him who said, I'm running just to make sure
[01:41:19.140 --> 01:41:23.940]   that Travis has to give a speech, but I'm voting for him too.
[01:41:23.940 --> 01:41:26.180]   That's what it sounds like.
[01:41:26.180 --> 01:41:27.180]   I love that.
[01:41:27.180 --> 01:41:28.900]   Frederick, where can people find you?
[01:41:28.900 --> 01:41:31.380]   You can find me at screencastonline.com.
[01:41:31.380 --> 01:41:34.820]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:41:34.820 --> 01:41:38.340]   And there you'll find tutorials and I'll get, you know, I got to say before, you know,
[01:41:38.340 --> 01:41:44.100]   I might fredder than on Twitter, but Don, I've been a fan of his stuff since the beginning
[01:41:44.100 --> 01:41:47.300]   of time and Don, you're all over my Apple TV.
[01:41:47.300 --> 01:41:48.300]   Thank you very much.
[01:41:48.300 --> 01:41:50.300]   I think you're filling it up.
[01:41:50.300 --> 01:41:52.300]   Please continue.
[01:41:52.300 --> 01:41:55.220]   So yeah, amazing tutorials over on screencast.
[01:41:55.220 --> 01:41:58.300]   And we also have this week in photo.
[01:41:58.300 --> 01:42:00.660]   This week in photo is the podcast that I hosted.
[01:42:00.660 --> 01:42:01.860]   Thisweekinphoto.com.
[01:42:01.860 --> 01:42:02.860]   Yeah.
[01:42:02.860 --> 01:42:07.300]   And you can follow this week in photo on Twitter at this week in photo.
[01:42:07.300 --> 01:42:08.300]   Yep.
[01:42:08.300 --> 01:42:09.300]   And I'm at Twitter.
[01:42:09.300 --> 01:42:11.100]   And that's the site came out so well.
[01:42:11.100 --> 01:42:12.580]   The site is so proud.
[01:42:12.580 --> 01:42:13.820]   We're very proud.
[01:42:13.820 --> 01:42:14.820]   Yes, yes.
[01:42:14.820 --> 01:42:18.260]   It is our place to hang out online.
[01:42:18.260 --> 01:42:19.260]   For photographers.
[01:42:19.260 --> 01:42:20.260]   Yes, absolutely.
[01:42:20.260 --> 01:42:22.260]   All right, folks.
[01:42:22.260 --> 01:42:23.260]   Break time is over.
[01:42:23.260 --> 01:42:23.860]   Back to work.
