[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.200]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly. We've got Andy Anaco and Ryan Block will talk about the iPhone 5.
[00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:10.200]   I haven't heard of Ryan's take on it yet. I think I remember him saying it's the best iPhone ever.
[00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.400]   We'll find out more about the maps to back.
[00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:19.200]   It might actually have been a big win for Apple and some anecdotes about Steve Jobs of the one year anniversary of his passing.
[00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:22.200]   It's all coming up next on Mac Break Weekly.
[00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:29.800]   Netcast you love from people you trust.

[00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:53.800]   Yes, I know Mac Break Weekly might be a little bit of a misnomer sometimes since we lately talk a lot about iOS, but so does Apple folks.
[00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:56.800]   I haven't heard a lot of Mac news lately.
[00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:57.800]   Maybe we'll get some in the near future.
[00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:02.800]   Let's introduce our panelists as always the great Andy Inako from the Chicago Sun Times.
[00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:03.800]   Great to have you.
[00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:05.800]   Looking really good.
[00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:06.800]   Looking really good.
[00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:08.800]   We've relit his set.
[00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:09.800]   Exactly.
[00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:13.800]   I've moved to a permanently to a Ramada in outside this connectivity.
[00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:19.800]   We sent out the gaffers and he's lit.
[00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:20.800]   He's lit.
[00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:23.800]   Oh, but I'm lit more ways than one Leo.
[00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:25.800]   Guinness is good for you.
[00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:29.800]   He's got a big mug of Joe or something.
[00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:30.800]   Let's record this thing.
[00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:32.800]   Actually, I know what that is.
[00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:34.800]   That sugar came based Coca-Cola.
[00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:36.800]   It is indeed.
[00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:37.800]   That's what I like.
[00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:38.800]   I know my TEDx Boston.
[00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:39.800]   Ooh, I like it.
[00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:41.800]   It marks me as a quasi-intellectual.
[00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:42.800]   Beautiful.
[00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:43.800]   A beautiful thing.
[00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:48.800]   Also with this, I'm really thrilled to have him the newlywed Ryan Block from gadget.com.
[00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:49.800]   Ryan, great to have you.
[00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:50.800]   Thanks.
[00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:52.800]   So nice to have you.
[00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:53.800]   Welcome.
[00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:55.800]   It's always an honor and a pleasure.
[00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:57.800]   I guess we've been talking about Andy's presence.
[00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:58.800]   Yes, I agree.
[00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:01.800]   He is the great Andy Inako.
[00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:05.800]   We've been talking about the iPhone 5 for two weeks now.
[00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:08.800]   But we haven't had a chance to hear from you.
[00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:09.800]   We heard from Peter.
[00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:12.800]   Peter Rojas of gadget on Twitter a couple of weeks ago.
[00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:15.800]   You don't want to hear what that guy is to say about that.
[00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:17.800]   He has a galaxy, he has three.
[00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:20.800]   But you carry the iPhone.
[00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:21.800]   I do.
[00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:23.800]   Yeah, I'm an iPhone user.
[00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:26.800]   I guess the real question at this point, there's a couple of questions.
[00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:30.800]   But the real question I would say, and certainly gadget is a great place to go to figure this
[00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:33.800]   out, since you aggregate reviews from all of the sources.
[00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:36.800]   And so you really can read the pros and cons of any phone.
[00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:41.800]   And you did give it a 96 on the gadget, score-o-meter, which is the best.
[00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:44.800]   Yeah, highest score we've ever given any phone.
[00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:45.800]   Wow.
[00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:46.800]   Yeah.
[00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:48.800]   The question is, who should upgrade or should everybody upgrade?
[00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:50.800]   If you have a 4S.
[00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:54.800]   Well, I mean, that's always a tricky question.
[00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:56.800]   It's a really personal thing.
[00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:00.800]   And at their finances and budget concerns for a lot of people involved.
[00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:03.800]   And not everybody has $700 to throw down.
[00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:08.800]   If they have a 4S, you're going to have to pay $700 at least on AT&T.
[00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:09.800]   It's upgrade.
[00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:12.800]   And not everybody has that for a new phone every single year.
[00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:14.800]   I think it's a really worthy upgrade.
[00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:22.200]   I think it's the best iPhone that Apple has ever created, even despite the extremely soft
[00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:24.240]   feeling metal that surrounds it.
[00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:27.800]   You wouldn't expect it to be any worse than a previous iPhone, though.
[00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:29.800]   Apple's not going to take a step backwards.
[00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:30.800]   No, no, of course.
[00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:33.800]   And it's funny that you mention that because Apple at every time.
[00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:34.800]   They say it every time.
[00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:35.800]   They always say.
[00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:39.200]   Yeah, no matter what the product is, it's always the best blank we've ever made where it's
[00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:40.800]   like, yeah, duh, of course it is.
[00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:43.800]   Like, you're not going to make a crappier version of what it would be.
[00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:46.800]   It's the downgrade, the iPhone.
[00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:47.800]   Some might say that, though.
[00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:51.160]   People who like the glass back or not may be as crazy as you just mentioned about the
[00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:55.120]   new metal back, although mine's not scratched or marred in any way.
[00:04:55.120 --> 00:05:00.560]   I think just in general, though, it is the biggest single upgrade in every single way
[00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:02.480]   that the iPhone has ever seen.
[00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:03.480]   Now that's interesting.
[00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:10.360]   Yeah, and one of the things I actually did, I wish I had the link handy, but I posted basically
[00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:15.360]   like if you kind of go back and look at what we consider exciting product launches, now
[00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:17.600]   use the iPhone as a primary example.
[00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:23.480]   And remember, the dialogue a couple weeks ago was not about maps and how crappy they
[00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:24.480]   were.
[00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:27.840]   The dialogue a couple weeks ago is, oh my god, the iPhone 5 is so unexciting and so
[00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:28.920]   underwhelming.
[00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:34.760]   You look at the iterations of each iPhone from the tent pole features.
[00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:39.400]   The five has the most and biggest and most interesting stuff that they've upgraded and
[00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:43.240]   changed and made better from one release to the next.
[00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:47.640]   And really, the retina display was a big one and adding 3G to the second iPhone, the
[00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:49.440]   iPhone 3G was a big one.
[00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:54.520]   But this is really the first amazing iPhone, I think.
[00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:55.520]   Really?
[00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:58.720]   I'm amazed that you say that.
[00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:05.440]   Look, I'm a long time iPhone user, but I think this is a really big step forward, I
[00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:07.200]   think, for the iPhone.
[00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:08.200]   Yeah.
[00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:09.920]   I agree up to a point.
[00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:16.120]   I think this is maybe the first really divisive iPhone because there are people who have been
[00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:21.000]   waiting since day one saying, oh goodness, I wish this had a bigger screen.
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.320]   And why goodness, why do I have to wait so long for true high speed?
[00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:28.000]   And man, if that's what you're waiting for, it's revolutionary.
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:33.600]   There is no comparison between the speed of the 4G and the speed of the LTE.
[00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:37.440]   And if you do like a larger screen, if you don't mind, making a device that's a little
[00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:41.040]   bit harder to manipulate with one hand, man, there is just no difference between it.
[00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:44.280]   There is just no comparing the small screen to the large screen.
[00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:49.840]   There are some folks I think are not going to be who definitely care about the high speed,
[00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:53.520]   who would prefer a smaller screen or prefer an even larger screen.
[00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:56.160]   So that's one separator.
[00:06:56.160 --> 00:07:00.360]   There are a lot of different leaps forward that you mentioned, one that you didn't mention,
[00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:01.360]   that's one of my favorites.
[00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:04.000]   Again, talk about things that are peculiar to the user.
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:08.800]   To me, the biggest jump forward the iPhone ever made was the iPhone 4, because not only
[00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:14.320]   was it the first time that Apple said, we're not even going to pretend to be styling this
[00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:17.840]   in any way that a previous phone has ever been styled before.
[00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:22.000]   We're going to do things that we think that only we can do, but also the jump forward
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:27.720]   in camera technology, where I just, I remember how in love I was with the first four, because
[00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:32.240]   this was the first phone where I could, there was not a single situation in which it couldn't
[00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:33.720]   take a good picture.
[00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:38.640]   It could still take bad, it could still take bad pictures compared to a conventional camera,
[00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:43.760]   but no longer was it a case where, oh well, unfortunately it's not a bright but overcast
[00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:46.280]   day, so I'm going to have to settle for whatever I get.
[00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:52.160]   Took great pictures in sunshine, took great pictures in low light, just great overall.
[00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:56.080]   So I think the, if I think the iPhone 5 is a mixed bag, it's not because it's an inferior
[00:07:56.080 --> 00:07:59.440]   product, like you guys said, it's better in every way.
[00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:03.400]   It's just that some of the features are not features that are going to directly speak to
[00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:04.400]   a lot of people.
[00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:09.000]   And I do think that the size of the display, it isn't a mistake, it's just that there are
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:14.120]   people who are going to be very peculiar about what size of phone they really like.
[00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:18.680]   And now there's one size unless you want to go back to the iPhone 4S, so that's going
[00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:21.960]   to be a disconnect for some people, but certainly not for most.
[00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:26.160]   Having used it now for a week and a half, I would say that you kind of nailed the one
[00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:27.800]   big difference, which is speed.
[00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:32.160]   And I don't mean merely LTE speed, although that's huge, but also the speed of the phone,
[00:08:32.160 --> 00:08:35.560]   when you combine the two, the phone feels very responsive.
[00:08:35.560 --> 00:08:39.600]   When you ask it to do something, in fact, I prefer to keep it on LTE over Wi-Fi.
[00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:45.040]   I'm going to hit the cap real fast, but LTE is so, I'm on Verizon LTE here in Petaluma,
[00:08:45.040 --> 00:08:46.800]   it's the only one we have.
[00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:50.400]   It's so fast that everything seems like it does, it happens right away.
[00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:53.240]   And that's a nice, that's actually really nice.
[00:08:53.240 --> 00:08:54.240]   Yeah.
[00:08:54.240 --> 00:08:55.240]   That's a big difference.
[00:08:55.240 --> 00:08:56.240]   So I'll grant you that.
[00:08:56.240 --> 00:08:57.240]   I'll grant you that.
[00:08:57.240 --> 00:09:00.600]   Yeah, I mean, the LTE, I was actually pretty blown away.
[00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:06.800]   I've tested LTE phones before, but again, not as my daily driver when I ran the bandwidth
[00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:11.960]   test for the first time at the cafe near my house, and I was getting 40 megabits.
[00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:12.960]   Yes.
[00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:13.960]   It's amazing.
[00:09:13.960 --> 00:09:15.960]   It felt like the future, right?
[00:09:15.960 --> 00:09:16.960]   It's kind of ridiculous.
[00:09:16.960 --> 00:09:23.880]   Oh, God, it absolutely sickens you because I know what bandwidth I get over copper in
[00:09:23.880 --> 00:09:24.880]   my own home.
[00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:25.880]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:09:25.880 --> 00:09:31.920]   Oh, screw you for giving me a phone that's even, this isn't unique to the iPhone.
[00:09:31.920 --> 00:09:36.080]   I know, but LTE speed is like screw you for giving me speed that's way better than my
[00:09:36.080 --> 00:09:37.080]   home internet.
[00:09:37.080 --> 00:09:38.080]   I know.
[00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:39.080]   I don't know.
[00:09:39.080 --> 00:09:44.440]   I'm sure you guys remember like going from a 2G like an edge phone or if you were on
[00:09:44.440 --> 00:09:49.320]   like, Sprint of Verizon, 1X RTT, to a 3G phone, the first 3G phone, and that felt like a
[00:09:49.320 --> 00:09:50.880]   pretty big step, right?
[00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:57.200]   But it didn't feel like it was blow the doors off like this changes absolutely everything,
[00:09:57.200 --> 00:10:02.080]   especially because in those days, the first iterations of 3G were just, they did not really
[00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:03.600]   ratchet the speeds up, right?
[00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:07.960]   3G back then was like one, you know, to 2 megabits if you were really lucky.
[00:10:07.960 --> 00:10:10.000]   And over the years, they made 3G a lot faster.
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:13.480]   Now you can sometimes get, you know, 8, 9, 10 megabits.
[00:10:13.480 --> 00:10:18.360]   But at the time, that switch that going from 2G to 3G was great, but it wasn't like,
[00:10:18.360 --> 00:10:22.800]   wow, this is totally fundamentally changed how I use this device.
[00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:27.640]   Going from 3G to LTE though, going from, you know, maybe 5, 6 megabits, which I get
[00:10:27.640 --> 00:10:33.040]   to 40 or 50 megabits, that actually really changes things.
[00:10:33.040 --> 00:10:37.560]   One note, if you're on a Verizon phone, they had a problem where when you were on the
[00:10:37.560 --> 00:10:43.560]   or on Wi-Fi, it was still using LTE and there is a carrier update, which you should get
[00:10:43.560 --> 00:10:45.160]   automatically.
[00:10:45.160 --> 00:10:47.680]   If you plug it into iTunes, it'll say, I have a carrier update.
[00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:49.120]   Would you like to do it?
[00:10:49.120 --> 00:10:52.120]   You can also, though, if you haven't plugged it into iTunes, and I think nowadays people
[00:10:52.120 --> 00:10:57.480]   don't do that as much as they used to, go to your settings and I think it's in general
[00:10:57.480 --> 00:11:01.160]   carrier or general cellular, you should be able to get that and then you'll have to turn
[00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:02.520]   your phone off and on.
[00:11:02.520 --> 00:11:06.960]   No word yet from Verizon if they're going to give people back some bandwidth because
[00:11:06.960 --> 00:11:10.680]   it has been using LTE in addition to the Wi-Fi.
[00:11:10.680 --> 00:11:13.760]   The other good thing about the Verizon phone, and that makes me look smart because I decided
[00:11:13.760 --> 00:11:16.960]   to move from AT&T and Verizon is it's a good international phone because they didn't lock
[00:11:16.960 --> 00:11:18.680]   the SIM card.
[00:11:18.680 --> 00:11:20.320]   I like that.
[00:11:20.320 --> 00:11:24.840]   That makes this maybe the best phone for travel out there because you get Verizon speeds in
[00:11:24.840 --> 00:11:28.600]   the US and you get unlocked GSM everywhere else.
[00:11:28.600 --> 00:11:31.400]   Of course, you have to find a nano SIM.
[00:11:31.400 --> 00:11:32.400]   Good luck.
[00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:35.000]   I got to buy a nano SIM cutter.
[00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:37.400]   Apparently, you can cut micro sims to nano sims.
[00:11:37.400 --> 00:11:41.120]   Okay, I don't know how much international travel you guys have done lately, but the last
[00:11:41.120 --> 00:11:48.120]   time I went overseas, my plan was to go get a foreign sim and pop that into my iPhone
[00:11:48.120 --> 00:11:49.120]   and use that.
[00:11:49.120 --> 00:11:50.120]   My phone is unlocked.
[00:11:50.120 --> 00:11:52.120]   I got to tell you, this was in France.
[00:11:52.120 --> 00:11:56.120]   Hard to do in France and England, it's easy.
[00:11:56.120 --> 00:12:00.440]   Okay, so maybe this varies from country to country, but in France, I went to three, four
[00:12:00.440 --> 00:12:01.440]   different carriers.
[00:12:01.440 --> 00:12:06.200]   I went to Orange and blah, blah, blah, whatever all those ones were.
[00:12:06.200 --> 00:12:08.720]   I could not get a sim.
[00:12:08.720 --> 00:12:10.440]   It would not sell me a sim.
[00:12:10.440 --> 00:12:13.000]   They definitely would not sell me a sim with data.
[00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:14.920]   It was not happening.
[00:12:14.920 --> 00:12:17.480]   I eventually broke down and just started using the international data.
[00:12:17.480 --> 00:12:19.360]   I always end up doing that too.
[00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:22.480]   Well, at least you have GSM.
[00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:25.280]   I found this is something I like about AT&T.
[00:12:25.280 --> 00:12:26.920]   They're international plans.
[00:12:26.920 --> 00:12:31.160]   They have a lot of stair steps so that you don't have to buy more than you need.
[00:12:31.160 --> 00:12:39.720]   I had one of those really disorientingly good things with AT&T recently when I went
[00:12:39.720 --> 00:12:41.240]   to Ireland.
[00:12:41.240 --> 00:12:44.480]   For some reason, I would like to say that the website screwed up.
[00:12:44.480 --> 00:12:49.000]   I thought I had bought international data and scheduled to start immediately.
[00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:53.480]   Apparently, they thought that I'd scheduled to start a month from that date.
[00:12:53.480 --> 00:12:56.320]   I was not covered by the time that I was traveling.
[00:12:56.320 --> 00:12:59.600]   When I called them to straighten things out, they said, "Okay, no problem.
[00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:03.960]   We'll just retroactively start it up for the day before you left."
[00:13:03.960 --> 00:13:05.120]   Also, are you home now?
[00:13:05.120 --> 00:13:06.120]   Yeah.
[00:13:06.120 --> 00:13:07.720]   Do you plan to travel internationally in the future?
[00:13:07.720 --> 00:13:08.720]   The next 30 days?
[00:13:08.720 --> 00:13:09.680]   No.
[00:13:09.680 --> 00:13:13.200]   Why don't we just charge you just for the full 30 days?
[00:13:13.200 --> 00:13:16.120]   We'll probably be up to you for 26 days back.
[00:13:16.120 --> 00:13:19.480]   That's why I was pleased to see that I could buy local Sims in London.
[00:13:19.480 --> 00:13:21.160]   Those are the easiest pie.
[00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:22.160]   It's like, "Okay."
[00:13:22.160 --> 00:13:27.640]   Or I could just save myself the hunt when I get there and just give AT&T more money.
[00:13:27.640 --> 00:13:28.640]   Yeah.
[00:13:28.640 --> 00:13:29.640]   That's what I'm going to be doing.
[00:13:29.640 --> 00:13:32.000]   I've done that a few times since then.
[00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:35.200]   Even just traveling to Canada, you have to deal with international data.
[00:13:35.200 --> 00:13:37.200]   Just put it on your AT&T plan.
[00:13:37.200 --> 00:13:39.800]   It's a pain to do over the website, but you can do it.
[00:13:39.800 --> 00:13:42.120]   Then turn it off when you're done.
[00:13:42.120 --> 00:13:44.480]   It's cost money, but it's not ridiculous.
[00:13:44.480 --> 00:13:45.480]   It's not.
[00:13:45.480 --> 00:13:47.880]   That's what I've done to now, but I now have this Verizon phone.
[00:13:47.880 --> 00:13:49.880]   I'll let you know how that goes.
[00:13:49.880 --> 00:13:53.880]   It does show you how different a lot of the local needs are.
[00:13:53.880 --> 00:13:59.480]   When I was in China, I bought a counterfeit iPhone and had one feature that I really
[00:13:59.480 --> 00:14:00.920]   wish that other phones had.
[00:14:00.920 --> 00:14:03.520]   It has two separate Sim slots in it.
[00:14:03.520 --> 00:14:07.400]   If you want, you can have one Sim slot there for your voice and your text and another Sim
[00:14:07.400 --> 00:14:09.560]   card for another account just for data.
[00:14:09.560 --> 00:14:11.040]   You can sort of divvy them up as you go.
[00:14:11.040 --> 00:14:13.440]   Guess that wasn't an Apple counterfeit iPhone.
[00:14:13.440 --> 00:14:15.680]   No, no, it was a...
[00:14:15.680 --> 00:14:19.280]   I'm not sure the fact that there was no H in iPhone on the box.
[00:14:19.280 --> 00:14:22.720]   I've told that perhaps I was dealing with a licensing issue.
[00:14:22.720 --> 00:14:23.720]   That is a good idea.
[00:14:23.720 --> 00:14:25.880]   I think that's not uncommon in Asia.
[00:14:25.880 --> 00:14:28.320]   Intellectual property one is what a tool says.
[00:14:28.320 --> 00:14:31.840]   That's what it stands for.
[00:14:31.840 --> 00:14:33.920]   I guess we'll get to the maps issue.
[00:14:33.920 --> 00:14:37.480]   It is close to the one year anniversary of the passing of Steve Jobs.
[00:14:37.480 --> 00:14:40.640]   That'll be October 5th, just a few days.
[00:14:40.640 --> 00:14:45.000]   And Forbes has just published a really, I thought, a really interesting article with
[00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:46.640]   anecdotes one year later.
[00:14:46.640 --> 00:14:51.080]   I think after a year goes by, people feel a little freer about talking about Steve Jobs
[00:14:51.080 --> 00:14:58.800]   and very, I think, interesting and telling and sweet anecdotes about our fearless leader.
[00:14:58.800 --> 00:15:00.680]   So we'll talk about that in just a bit as well.
[00:15:00.680 --> 00:15:05.200]   Andy Inako is here with Ryan Block from Gadget and he's from the Chicago Sad Times.
[00:15:05.200 --> 00:15:09.880]   We're talking on iOS weekly.
[00:15:09.880 --> 00:15:12.400]   Can we find some Mac news of any kind, any kind of...
[00:15:12.400 --> 00:15:13.400]   Any kind of...
[00:15:13.400 --> 00:15:15.000]   Let's have a little project.
[00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:18.440]   We'll start to figure out that Mac actually is an acronym for something.
[00:15:18.440 --> 00:15:21.600]   Macintosh is Apple and communication devices.
[00:15:21.600 --> 00:15:22.600]   There you go.
[00:15:22.600 --> 00:15:23.760]   That's what the Mac stands for.
[00:15:23.760 --> 00:15:25.680]   You thought it's good for Macintosh.
[00:15:25.680 --> 00:15:26.680]   Oh no.
[00:15:26.680 --> 00:15:27.680]   Oh no.
[00:15:27.680 --> 00:15:29.680]   You're holding it wrong.
[00:15:29.680 --> 00:15:36.680]   We keep hearing rumors there's going to be new Macs.
[00:15:36.680 --> 00:15:42.680]   There's always going to be new Macs.
[00:15:42.680 --> 00:15:47.440]   What's a Mac?
[00:15:47.440 --> 00:15:49.000]   I can't change the name.
[00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:50.240]   We're invested.
[00:15:50.240 --> 00:15:52.080]   We've got like lower third graphics.
[00:15:52.080 --> 00:15:53.080]   You know what?
[00:15:53.080 --> 00:15:54.080]   You can change the name.
[00:15:54.080 --> 00:15:55.080]   We'll change the name.
[00:15:55.080 --> 00:15:56.080]   Oh, it's too much.
[00:15:56.080 --> 00:15:57.080]   What should I change it to?
[00:15:57.080 --> 00:15:58.080]   Just break weekly.
[00:15:58.080 --> 00:15:59.080]   Apple.
[00:15:59.080 --> 00:16:01.760]   I'm going to show when I have an iPad show.
[00:16:01.760 --> 00:16:03.360]   It's called the Apple weekly.
[00:16:03.360 --> 00:16:04.360]   Apple weekly.
[00:16:04.360 --> 00:16:05.360]   Apple break weekly.
[00:16:05.360 --> 00:16:06.360]   Come on.
[00:16:06.360 --> 00:16:07.360]   Who cares?
[00:16:07.360 --> 00:16:08.360]   You can do it everyone.
[00:16:08.360 --> 00:16:10.360]   Apple Jack weekly.
[00:16:10.360 --> 00:16:11.360]   All about Apple Jacks.
[00:16:11.360 --> 00:16:12.360]   I will say...
[00:16:12.360 --> 00:16:13.360]   I will say...
[00:16:13.360 --> 00:16:14.360]   I'm not a Mac fan of it.
[00:16:14.360 --> 00:16:16.360]   If you really want to look at it or be on the revenueers...
[00:16:16.360 --> 00:16:17.440]   You really want to talk about Macs.
[00:16:17.440 --> 00:16:19.520]   You know, I use the Rhett and the MacBook Pro.
[00:16:19.520 --> 00:16:20.520]   Love it.
[00:16:20.520 --> 00:16:21.520]   Yeah, it's really...
[00:16:21.520 --> 00:16:22.520]   Best computer ever.
[00:16:22.520 --> 00:16:23.520]   So amazing.
[00:16:23.520 --> 00:16:25.520]   Best computer ever.
[00:16:25.520 --> 00:16:26.520]   It's really good.
[00:16:26.520 --> 00:16:32.240]   There are a lot of people, a lot of technology pundits who talk about...
[00:16:32.240 --> 00:16:34.040]   They don't really care about their computers anymore.
[00:16:34.040 --> 00:16:35.680]   They just work on iPads and stuff like that.
[00:16:35.680 --> 00:16:36.680]   And that's fine.
[00:16:36.680 --> 00:16:37.680]   If it works very fine.
[00:16:37.680 --> 00:16:43.080]   Laptop is still the easiest way for me to get the most stuff done the fastest.
[00:16:43.080 --> 00:16:45.760]   And this machine is really, really good.
[00:16:45.760 --> 00:16:46.760]   Really good.
[00:16:46.760 --> 00:16:51.200]   I'm also looking forward to putting a couple of 27-inch displays on it.
[00:16:51.200 --> 00:16:52.200]   That's my next setup.
[00:16:52.200 --> 00:16:53.520]   That's what I do.
[00:16:53.520 --> 00:16:54.520]   I don't use 27s.
[00:16:54.520 --> 00:16:55.520]   I use 24s.
[00:16:55.520 --> 00:17:00.360]   I have my MacBook Pro Retina on a Griffin elevator.
[00:17:00.360 --> 00:17:02.400]   So it's up and off to the right.
[00:17:02.400 --> 00:17:05.000]   And then I have my primary displays of 24.
[00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:06.640]   And then I have a secondary 24 on the other side.
[00:17:06.640 --> 00:17:09.480]   So it's three displays that kind of wraps around a little.
[00:17:09.480 --> 00:17:11.240]   It's pretty amazing.
[00:17:11.240 --> 00:17:12.240]   But even when I'm not doing...
[00:17:12.240 --> 00:17:15.920]   Even when I'm just using the Retina where I can have everything on the Retina, it's
[00:17:15.920 --> 00:17:16.920]   so good.
[00:17:16.920 --> 00:17:17.920]   Yeah.
[00:17:17.920 --> 00:17:18.920]   Yeah.
[00:17:18.920 --> 00:17:20.520]   It's been a while since I've used a desktop machine.
[00:17:20.520 --> 00:17:24.840]   I still have an iMac in my office, but everything is my 15-inch MacBook.
[00:17:24.840 --> 00:17:30.040]   And I'm kind of surprised that Apple hasn't been a little bit more aggressive in underscoring
[00:17:30.040 --> 00:17:32.360]   that this is the only machine you ever need.
[00:17:32.360 --> 00:17:33.960]   We will sell you a desktop if you want one.
[00:17:33.960 --> 00:17:37.280]   But hey, why would you want one when you can even sell you with this wonderful Thunderbolt
[00:17:37.280 --> 00:17:39.760]   display that will give you all those advanced ports.
[00:17:39.760 --> 00:17:41.920]   One plug, one tiny little plug will give you...
[00:17:41.920 --> 00:17:47.800]   Will turn this lovely $1,000, $1,500 super slim notebook into a full desktop class machine.
[00:17:47.800 --> 00:17:49.840]   I am a big fan of the iPad.
[00:17:49.840 --> 00:17:54.800]   I am one of those writers who, whenever I travel, I need to have a really good experience.
[00:17:54.800 --> 00:17:56.400]   I'm not an excuse to bring the MacBook with me.
[00:17:56.400 --> 00:17:59.040]   I tend to travel with just the iPad these days.
[00:17:59.040 --> 00:18:03.240]   But I can only get away with that by the fact that I can VPN-dacked my office to a real
[00:18:03.240 --> 00:18:07.720]   computer for the real desktop apps that I often need.
[00:18:07.720 --> 00:18:09.200]   Yeah.
[00:18:09.200 --> 00:18:16.280]   Anybody know off the top of your head when the 30-pin adapters are going to ship?
[00:18:16.280 --> 00:18:17.280]   October?
[00:18:17.280 --> 00:18:18.280]   Yes.
[00:18:18.280 --> 00:18:19.280]   I believe...
[00:18:19.280 --> 00:18:20.280]   Wait a minute.
[00:18:20.280 --> 00:18:21.280]   Let me check.
[00:18:21.280 --> 00:18:22.280]   This is October.
[00:18:22.280 --> 00:18:24.880]   Fair. Usually Apple says 10 days, 7 days...
[00:18:24.880 --> 00:18:26.360]   The month of October.
[00:18:26.360 --> 00:18:30.400]   You know, I got to say that is to me the big...
[00:18:30.400 --> 00:18:35.440]   I actually think that that is a bigger blunder for Apple in some ways than the maps.
[00:18:35.440 --> 00:18:37.360]   Maps is like a really big deal.
[00:18:37.360 --> 00:18:43.160]   But if you think about how big the ecosystem of 30-pin accessories is in the world, I
[00:18:43.160 --> 00:18:48.400]   mean, it far out numbers the number of iPhones out there because of all the iPods people
[00:18:48.400 --> 00:18:51.800]   have accumulated over the last 10 years.
[00:18:51.800 --> 00:18:57.520]   Watching a new product with a new connector and not having the adapter to the old connector
[00:18:57.520 --> 00:19:02.840]   really extremely bad move, in my opinion.
[00:19:02.840 --> 00:19:05.400]   I just can't see why they did that.
[00:19:05.400 --> 00:19:06.840]   Why they think that that would be acceptable.
[00:19:06.840 --> 00:19:11.400]   I've found that very frustrating to not be able to use any of my docs and devices and
[00:19:11.400 --> 00:19:12.400]   accessories.
[00:19:12.400 --> 00:19:14.880]   Not to mention the cost.
[00:19:14.880 --> 00:19:19.040]   I've spent almost $200 now in extra cables and adapters.
[00:19:19.040 --> 00:19:23.240]   I haven't got any adapters, but I've got three new cables because I want one in my car, one
[00:19:23.240 --> 00:19:25.760]   at the office, an extra one at home.
[00:19:25.760 --> 00:19:28.000]   I'm used to having 30-pin connectors every week.
[00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:29.640]   We even have them coming out of this table.
[00:19:29.640 --> 00:19:31.920]   I've got two in the car.
[00:19:31.920 --> 00:19:35.720]   I've got four next to every single... four in almost every room.
[00:19:35.720 --> 00:19:39.080]   I almost never have to look for one because it's right there at a five-by-solder.
[00:19:39.080 --> 00:19:44.720]   And when you talk about a $30 or $40 adapter that is required stuff for so many people,
[00:19:44.720 --> 00:19:46.360]   it's bad that it costs so much money.
[00:19:46.360 --> 00:19:50.040]   It's worse that you can't even get your hands on these things.
[00:19:50.040 --> 00:19:53.360]   I would love to hear a story coming out of Cupertino that says that they're actually
[00:19:53.360 --> 00:19:58.320]   only making about $0.89 in each part that is a heavily subsidized part.
[00:19:58.320 --> 00:20:01.960]   I agree that the resize connector... excuse me?
[00:20:01.960 --> 00:20:04.360]   Oh, but it's just not true.
[00:20:04.360 --> 00:20:06.960]   We know it costs all those things.
[00:20:06.960 --> 00:20:07.960]   Exactly.
[00:20:07.960 --> 00:20:13.320]   I would like to hear that, but that would make us feel better.
[00:20:13.320 --> 00:20:17.560]   That would mitigate it slightly because if Apple...
[00:20:17.560 --> 00:20:23.600]   This is a little like... it's just a tiny, tiny bit like the vendor at the rock concert
[00:20:23.600 --> 00:20:26.240]   that charges $6 for bottle of water.
[00:20:26.240 --> 00:20:29.680]   And they've signed an agreement that says that people at the gate have to take away
[00:20:29.680 --> 00:20:33.160]   any water from anybody who comes into the venue because they know that this is... because
[00:20:33.160 --> 00:20:36.520]   it's so heavily chipped, because it's so heavily secured, there's no way you can make
[00:20:36.520 --> 00:20:37.840]   a third-party cable work.
[00:20:37.840 --> 00:20:39.600]   So sorry, only source of water.
[00:20:39.600 --> 00:20:41.600]   Or you can just like dehydrate.
[00:20:41.600 --> 00:20:42.600]   Yeah.
[00:20:42.600 --> 00:20:46.160]   Hey, remember how we told you that you don't need wires to sink?
[00:20:46.160 --> 00:20:49.960]   Why don't you try that out for the next 30 days or come back here with 40 bucks and we'll
[00:20:49.960 --> 00:20:50.960]   fix you up.
[00:20:50.960 --> 00:20:51.960]   I'm giving a...
[00:20:51.960 --> 00:20:56.720]   Chad, I'm giving you my renew clock because I don't have anything I can...
[00:20:56.720 --> 00:20:58.440]   It has a 30-pin dock.
[00:20:58.440 --> 00:21:03.040]   It's a special alarm clock that watches you sleep and you put your iPhone in there and
[00:21:03.040 --> 00:21:05.600]   you start the software and it tracks your movements.
[00:21:05.600 --> 00:21:07.160]   It doesn't work.
[00:21:07.160 --> 00:21:08.160]   No use to you.
[00:21:08.160 --> 00:21:09.160]   So...
[00:21:09.160 --> 00:21:10.160]   Hurray for me.
[00:21:10.160 --> 00:21:11.360]   So those who do not upgrade have a certain...
[00:21:11.360 --> 00:21:13.280]   This is by the way part of the calculation.
[00:21:13.280 --> 00:21:16.680]   I think everybody should make, if they are deciding whether to go say from a 4S to a
[00:21:16.680 --> 00:21:19.280]   5, is that that is not insignificant.
[00:21:19.280 --> 00:21:23.040]   My Sonos Dock gone, my renew clock radio gone to...
[00:21:23.040 --> 00:21:25.000]   Would you like a Sonos Dock?
[00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:26.640]   Because I got one of those too.
[00:21:26.640 --> 00:21:30.040]   I feel greedy and I got like 830-pin cable everywhere.
[00:21:30.040 --> 00:21:31.040]   30-pin cables.
[00:21:31.040 --> 00:21:32.600]   It makes me sad.
[00:21:32.600 --> 00:21:34.920]   It hurts my heart when I see a 30-pin cable now.
[00:21:34.920 --> 00:21:35.920]   It's like...
[00:21:35.920 --> 00:21:40.120]   An investment in either airplay or Bluetooth speakers is starting to look a lot smarter
[00:21:40.120 --> 00:21:41.880]   than it did just six months ago.
[00:21:41.880 --> 00:21:43.560]   Sonos needs to make a Bluetooth interface.
[00:21:43.560 --> 00:21:46.560]   They stopped the docks and maybe they wouldn't have to play it.
[00:21:46.560 --> 00:21:51.240]   Would it really have killed Apple to do a trade-in program, bring in a 30-pin cable
[00:21:51.240 --> 00:21:53.760]   and we'll knock 10 bucks off your next lightning?
[00:21:53.760 --> 00:21:54.760]   You know the cable.
[00:21:54.760 --> 00:21:55.760]   It would be nice.
[00:21:55.760 --> 00:21:57.080]   Bring in this and we'll give you...
[00:21:57.080 --> 00:22:03.080]   It's not even that they have all this money that they're sitting on and not doing anything.
[00:22:03.080 --> 00:22:05.000]   They're a customer service centric organization.
[00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:07.880]   They love to talk about how well they treat their customers.
[00:22:07.880 --> 00:22:12.880]   I think everybody who's started to make this transition from 30-pin to lightning really
[00:22:12.880 --> 00:22:15.360]   feels like they're being taken advantage of.
[00:22:15.360 --> 00:22:17.040]   I feel like I'm being taken advantage of.
[00:22:17.040 --> 00:22:22.240]   I feel like I shouldn't have had to spend $80 on new cables.
[00:22:22.240 --> 00:22:25.480]   Not because I shouldn't have the new cables.
[00:22:25.480 --> 00:22:28.520]   We have to make the transition but because that's egregious.
[00:22:28.520 --> 00:22:31.240]   Why don't they try to help me out a little bit here?
[00:22:31.240 --> 00:22:33.960]   I spent 700 bucks on this phone.
[00:22:33.960 --> 00:22:34.960]   Do me a solid.
[00:22:34.960 --> 00:22:37.600]   Make the cables cheaper for me since I'm making this transition.
[00:22:37.600 --> 00:22:38.600]   I'm not a new customer.
[00:22:38.600 --> 00:22:40.480]   I'm an old customer.
[00:22:40.480 --> 00:22:41.560]   It doesn't feel right to me.
[00:22:41.560 --> 00:22:43.400]   It doesn't feel good.
[00:22:43.400 --> 00:22:47.640]   I've seen on eBay and other places adapters.
[00:22:47.640 --> 00:22:48.640]   Has anybody tried those?
[00:22:48.640 --> 00:22:49.640]   Those can't possibly work.
[00:22:49.640 --> 00:22:50.640]   No chance.
[00:22:50.640 --> 00:22:56.280]   They're going to come find her down to this honest to God.
[00:22:56.280 --> 00:22:59.960]   There have been a couple of different teardowns in these cables showing how much electronics
[00:22:59.960 --> 00:23:01.160]   are embedded in this.
[00:23:01.160 --> 00:23:03.120]   It's not just wires going to wires.
[00:23:03.120 --> 00:23:09.240]   It's wires going to a controller that decides the version of the plug and what signals need
[00:23:09.240 --> 00:23:10.240]   to go where.
[00:23:10.240 --> 00:23:14.360]   If there's any one of these that works the way that a regular lightning cable does, I
[00:23:14.360 --> 00:23:16.240]   will be absolutely shocked.
[00:23:16.240 --> 00:23:18.280]   You've got to license it.
[00:23:18.280 --> 00:23:21.760]   I think one thing that we might see is charge only cables.
[00:23:21.760 --> 00:23:25.960]   So cables that need support data because if I remember correctly the pin out on the lightning
[00:23:25.960 --> 00:23:29.600]   cables, pin one on both sides, it's not symmetrical.
[00:23:29.600 --> 00:23:31.800]   It's flipped.
[00:23:31.800 --> 00:23:35.680]   When you reverse the cable orientation, it's always pin one.
[00:23:35.680 --> 00:23:37.480]   That pin is always assigned to power.
[00:23:37.480 --> 00:23:38.720]   So you can always do that.
[00:23:38.720 --> 00:23:40.720]   That doesn't require ADD conversely.
[00:23:40.720 --> 00:23:41.720]   I'm not mistaken.
[00:23:41.720 --> 00:23:48.360]   I haven't tested this, but from what I've read about how the pin outs work and how the
[00:23:48.360 --> 00:23:53.120]   pin assignments work and all that stuff, you should be able in theory to get a charge-only
[00:23:53.120 --> 00:23:54.880]   cable for really cheap.
[00:23:54.880 --> 00:23:56.400]   It won't do anything else.
[00:23:56.400 --> 00:23:59.520]   It won't transmit data or do audio on any of that stuff.
[00:23:59.520 --> 00:24:04.920]   It should be able to charge you by we being, I'd have to see those cables.
[00:24:04.920 --> 00:24:05.920]   That's definitely possible.
[00:24:05.920 --> 00:24:10.280]   I would like to see that working first because we know that Apple has occasionally done some
[00:24:10.280 --> 00:24:17.560]   clever things with a 30-pin connector to make charging not work or fast charging not work
[00:24:17.560 --> 00:24:19.120]   on the right cable.
[00:24:19.120 --> 00:24:22.240]   So I'm not sure.
[00:24:22.240 --> 00:24:23.240]   That's absolutely true.
[00:24:23.240 --> 00:24:29.480]   There are some things you could do without the chip, but still, before I spend $7.80
[00:24:29.480 --> 00:24:34.000]   even on a third-party cable, I want to check out to see what exactly it works.
[00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:36.160]   What about these?
[00:24:36.160 --> 00:24:37.160]   These won't work though.
[00:24:37.160 --> 00:24:41.200]   I'm thinking this is a Bluetooth connector with a 30-pin connector that goes on an Apple
[00:24:41.200 --> 00:24:46.040]   dock and then you would boot Bluetooth A2DP parrot.
[00:24:46.040 --> 00:24:51.640]   Would that be a way to get your iPhone 5 via Bluetooth into a docking station?
[00:24:51.640 --> 00:24:57.200]   That could work because the old 30-pin connector has pretty straightforward audio.
[00:24:57.200 --> 00:24:58.200]   Right.
[00:24:58.200 --> 00:25:00.200]   So you wouldn't get probably control.
[00:25:00.200 --> 00:25:01.440]   You might get control.
[00:25:01.440 --> 00:25:03.880]   Stop, start, next.
[00:25:03.880 --> 00:25:04.880]   Control.
[00:25:04.880 --> 00:25:05.880]   Yes.
[00:25:05.880 --> 00:25:11.200]   The only problem with those is if I remember correctly, Apple specifically does not allow
[00:25:11.200 --> 00:25:14.480]   a license for 30-pin to Bluetooth adapters.
[00:25:14.480 --> 00:25:19.640]   That was something that a number of companies have wanted to do and anybody who's a part
[00:25:19.640 --> 00:25:25.200]   of the Made for iPhone program is, if I remember correctly, specifically instructed not to
[00:25:25.200 --> 00:25:26.560]   create that specific product.
[00:25:26.560 --> 00:25:33.160]   That Apple really feels very strongly adapting 30-pin to Bluetooth not allowed.
[00:25:33.160 --> 00:25:35.400]   Their solution for that is AirPlay.
[00:25:35.400 --> 00:25:36.840]   That's how they want you to do it.
[00:25:36.840 --> 00:25:37.840]   Oh, yeah.
[00:25:37.840 --> 00:25:40.760]   Did we mention AirPlay actually costs a lot of money to implement.
[00:25:40.760 --> 00:25:45.280]   I've heard on the order of $20 to $30 per unit.
[00:25:45.280 --> 00:25:46.280]   So yeah.
[00:25:46.280 --> 00:25:47.280]   Do that.
[00:25:47.280 --> 00:25:50.000]   Well, let me take a hit for you guys.
[00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:54.320]   I'm going to order one of these and just see.
[00:25:54.320 --> 00:25:58.160]   The difference there is that Apple can't do much to...
[00:25:58.160 --> 00:26:02.120]   There is the certification program, but Apple can't do very much to prevent someone from
[00:26:02.120 --> 00:26:05.960]   just tickling the right pins and leading it into a Bluetooth converter.
[00:26:05.960 --> 00:26:08.000]   So that's the sort of thing that I might gamble on.
[00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:10.280]   I've tried a whole bunch of different Bluetooth devices.
[00:26:10.280 --> 00:26:16.200]   I've tried a whole bunch of different non-licensed 30-pin dock devices that work just fine.
[00:26:16.200 --> 00:26:19.840]   But these new lightning connectors, they are really nicely tightened down from Apple's
[00:26:19.840 --> 00:26:20.840]   point of view.
[00:26:20.840 --> 00:26:25.400]   I would have to see something functioning before I would agree that okay, that seems to actually
[00:26:25.400 --> 00:26:26.400]   work.
[00:26:26.400 --> 00:26:30.000]   My only point about those devices is not that they couldn't work.
[00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:31.560]   I think that they can work.
[00:26:31.560 --> 00:26:37.720]   As far as I know, you're not ever going to see them from a bigger, larger, more reputable
[00:26:37.720 --> 00:26:38.880]   manufacturer.
[00:26:38.880 --> 00:26:41.880]   Because all those guys are part of the licensing program and they've been told not to create
[00:26:41.880 --> 00:26:42.880]   that product.
[00:26:42.880 --> 00:26:46.800]   There may be some hope because according to Apple and cider today, Apple has patented,
[00:26:46.800 --> 00:26:52.200]   they applied for this a year ago, a wireless adapter for a 30-pin connector.
[00:26:52.200 --> 00:26:56.760]   But the problem, I don't normally report on Apple patents because they patent everything.
[00:26:56.760 --> 00:27:01.000]   They got on-staff lawyers, so they might as well just patent everything.
[00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:08.320]   Wireless adapter for interfacing between an accessory and a device for a 30-pin.
[00:27:08.320 --> 00:27:09.960]   Maybe Apple would sell a wireless solution.
[00:27:09.960 --> 00:27:11.760]   It would help me.
[00:27:11.760 --> 00:27:18.280]   Historically, they've really never been concerned about selling products that guarantee backward
[00:27:18.280 --> 00:27:19.280]   compatibility.
[00:27:19.280 --> 00:27:21.560]   They'll support old products.
[00:27:21.560 --> 00:27:25.600]   The reason why the stores are still going to be stocked with 30-pin cables and 30-pin
[00:27:25.600 --> 00:27:29.480]   docks and 30-pin connectors is because the 4S and the 4 and the 3GS are still active
[00:27:29.480 --> 00:27:30.760]   products.
[00:27:30.760 --> 00:27:34.880]   But they would never do anything to encourage you not to go back into the Apple store and
[00:27:34.880 --> 00:27:36.560]   buy something brand new.
[00:27:36.560 --> 00:27:40.800]   I'm sorry to discourage you from going back into the Apple store and replacing your old
[00:27:40.800 --> 00:27:41.720]   product.
[00:27:41.720 --> 00:27:43.880]   I want everybody to move the 9-pin connector.
[00:27:43.880 --> 00:27:46.440]   Once the paint's done, it is a better connector.
[00:27:46.440 --> 00:27:48.360]   Two years from now, no one's going to complain about this.
[00:27:48.360 --> 00:27:52.240]   We'll have a whole bunch of cool devices that couldn't have been built without it.
[00:27:52.240 --> 00:27:57.280]   Honestly, my only complaint about lightning, I'm going to go on the record as I've been
[00:27:57.280 --> 00:28:00.840]   saying they needed to ditch the 30-pin connector for many, many years.
[00:28:00.840 --> 00:28:02.800]   It's just too big.
[00:28:02.800 --> 00:28:06.440]   They're designing these products around the connector because it's so massive.
[00:28:06.440 --> 00:28:08.680]   You look at the inside of an iPhone 4 or 4S.
[00:28:08.680 --> 00:28:13.640]   It's like half of the inside is designed around just the connector.
[00:28:13.640 --> 00:28:16.240]   My biggest complaint is not that they're doing it, just that they're doing it now.
[00:28:16.240 --> 00:28:19.640]   They should have done this a couple of years ago and just pulled off the band-aid and gotten
[00:28:19.640 --> 00:28:20.640]   it over with.
[00:28:20.640 --> 00:28:23.720]   Well, they pulled off the band-aid and I'm screaming.
[00:28:23.720 --> 00:28:24.720]   I'll be okay.
[00:28:24.720 --> 00:28:25.720]   I'll be okay.
[00:28:25.720 --> 00:28:33.200]   Andy and I go, I was going to go to a break like 20 minutes ago, but we'll do it now.
[00:28:33.200 --> 00:28:34.720]   Andy and I can...
[00:28:34.720 --> 00:28:35.880]   It's fun to talk to you guys.
[00:28:35.880 --> 00:28:36.880]   I don't want to stop.
[00:28:36.880 --> 00:28:38.880]   You don't...
[00:28:38.880 --> 00:28:42.800]   Once you get the genius taps turned on, you don't want to cut off that flow.
[00:28:42.800 --> 00:28:44.200]   That's exactly right.
[00:28:44.200 --> 00:28:48.120]   We don't want to cut off the flow in midstream, so to speak.
[00:28:48.120 --> 00:28:50.400]   But I'm going to do it anyway.
[00:28:50.400 --> 00:28:52.120]   I hear it's good for you.
[00:28:52.120 --> 00:28:54.800]   Andy and Iko is here for the Chicago Sun Times.
[00:28:54.800 --> 00:28:55.800]   What is that?
[00:28:55.800 --> 00:28:59.440]   Batman, Robin, the Justice League, what the hell is that?
[00:28:59.440 --> 00:29:03.920]   That was my last serious iPhone 5 test shots.
[00:29:03.920 --> 00:29:08.560]   Yes, this is unfortunately a collection of statues that I just grabbed off a shelf in my
[00:29:08.560 --> 00:29:09.560]   office.
[00:29:09.560 --> 00:29:17.200]   We will reveal later in the show, because you did a really great test, camera test.
[00:29:17.200 --> 00:29:18.400]   Yeah, I had a whole...
[00:29:18.400 --> 00:29:20.200]   We'll get to that after the break.
[00:29:20.200 --> 00:29:23.960]   I had a couple of things that kind of confused me, so I had to hold off for a few days to
[00:29:23.960 --> 00:29:24.960]   retest some stuff.
[00:29:24.960 --> 00:29:26.960]   Part one of the review is up today.
[00:29:26.960 --> 00:29:28.560]   2000 words about the camera.
[00:29:28.560 --> 00:29:29.560]   Good.
[00:29:29.560 --> 00:29:30.560]   That will be interesting.
[00:29:30.560 --> 00:29:37.600]   So from Gadget, gdgtt.com, Ryan Block, Gadget's the greatest site for people who want to.
[00:29:37.600 --> 00:29:40.960]   This is a really good test case for Gadget, is the iPhone 5.
[00:29:40.960 --> 00:29:45.160]   You could go to magazine after magazine, website after website, and look at all the
[00:29:45.160 --> 00:29:53.440]   reviews, or you could just go to gdgtt.com, where they have 101 reviews aggregated.
[00:29:53.440 --> 00:30:00.160]   On the iPhone 5, they give it a 96 highest score ever for a smartphone.
[00:30:00.160 --> 00:30:01.960]   Leading product, definitely worth owning.
[00:30:01.960 --> 00:30:03.520]   Instant classic.
[00:30:03.520 --> 00:30:05.320]   They say why they like it, which is great.
[00:30:05.320 --> 00:30:10.400]   And don't waste your time with a long, long review, just the basic information you need.
[00:30:10.400 --> 00:30:13.320]   Co-late, not merely the critics, but user reviews.
[00:30:13.320 --> 00:30:18.240]   This is the best possible way to get a very wide ranging take.
[00:30:18.240 --> 00:30:21.200]   Pro and con, yes, there's a 4.0 meter.
[00:30:21.200 --> 00:30:22.200]   Huh?
[00:30:22.200 --> 00:30:24.280]   Our own tech tomato meter.
[00:30:24.280 --> 00:30:26.240]   I think that must be the inspiration, right?
[00:30:26.240 --> 00:30:27.240]   Rotten tomatoes.
[00:30:27.240 --> 00:30:28.240]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:30:28.240 --> 00:30:30.240]   Rotten tomatoes and Metacritic.
[00:30:30.240 --> 00:30:33.760]   I think those are both amazing sites, amazing companies.
[00:30:33.760 --> 00:30:36.960]   I've always loved what they do and how they do it.
[00:30:36.960 --> 00:30:38.960]   We do it a little differently.
[00:30:38.960 --> 00:30:42.560]   We do a lot more independent research and analysis.
[00:30:42.560 --> 00:30:46.880]   We don't just take the data and put it through an algorithm, although we do have a lot of
[00:30:46.880 --> 00:30:48.600]   data and we do put it in an algorithm.
[00:30:48.600 --> 00:30:53.800]   But we have a lot of humans involved in our selection and reviewing process as well.
[00:30:53.800 --> 00:30:57.600]   I think this is an inspired solution.
[00:30:57.600 --> 00:30:58.600]   You know what?
[00:30:58.600 --> 00:31:02.880]   I don't go to a movie without looking at Rotten Tomatoes now, which just shows you that you
[00:31:02.880 --> 00:31:10.320]   can become definitive as an aggregator, which is very surprising to me.
[00:31:10.320 --> 00:31:13.360]   I used to say, "Oh, I have to see the New Yorker review in the New York Times review."
[00:31:13.360 --> 00:31:15.440]   Now, what's the tomato score?
[00:31:15.440 --> 00:31:16.440]   Tomato meter.
[00:31:16.440 --> 00:31:19.280]   I went yesterday, Saturday, to the movie.
[00:31:19.280 --> 00:31:22.520]   I just went to the one that had the highest tomato meter.
[00:31:22.520 --> 00:31:23.520]   That's sad.
[00:31:23.520 --> 00:31:24.520]   Nice.
[00:31:24.520 --> 00:31:25.520]   It was good.
[00:31:25.520 --> 00:31:26.520]   It was loopers.
[00:31:26.520 --> 00:31:28.640]   This is going to be horrible.
[00:31:28.640 --> 00:31:30.600]   It got 90 or something.
[00:31:30.600 --> 00:31:31.840]   It got a huge score.
[00:31:31.840 --> 00:31:33.200]   I went and you know what?
[00:31:33.200 --> 00:31:35.520]   It deserved it.
[00:31:35.520 --> 00:31:36.520]   It works.
[00:31:36.520 --> 00:31:37.520]   It was good.
[00:31:37.520 --> 00:31:42.560]   Part of it for us though is I've been doing this stuff for a long time.
[00:31:42.560 --> 00:31:49.160]   I felt like the world didn't really need another review of a product.
[00:31:49.160 --> 00:31:50.920]   Andy is an incredibly smart guy.
[00:31:50.920 --> 00:31:54.960]   He's going to say a lot of amazing things as he publishes these portions of his review.
[00:31:54.960 --> 00:31:56.480]   He's being catch a guy.
[00:31:56.480 --> 00:32:02.080]   All these people who are creating these great reviews, but there was an opportunity to take
[00:32:02.080 --> 00:32:06.680]   all that data and put it together in a new way as a layer that sits on top or to the
[00:32:06.680 --> 00:32:08.880]   side of those reviews.
[00:32:08.880 --> 00:32:11.080]   We privilege Critic Reviews very highly.
[00:32:11.080 --> 00:32:13.560]   It's one of the very first things you see on the page show.
[00:32:13.560 --> 00:32:18.160]   We hope that for anybody who wants to dig in deeper, we can also be a great place to
[00:32:18.160 --> 00:32:20.800]   go find the list of all those amazing reviews.
[00:32:20.800 --> 00:32:23.200]   94% on looper.
[00:32:23.200 --> 00:32:24.920]   I'm sorry.
[00:32:24.920 --> 00:32:25.920]   Dread has 76%.
[00:32:25.920 --> 00:32:28.680]   I just know why I'm going to see dread 3D.
[00:32:28.680 --> 00:32:30.520]   No way.
[00:32:30.520 --> 00:32:34.560]   Sometimes I just don't care what the tomato meter says.
[00:32:34.560 --> 00:32:35.560]   Andy, what's the deal?
[00:32:35.560 --> 00:32:37.360]   Why is your review not on gadget?
[00:32:37.360 --> 00:32:38.760]   You know, what's the story here?
[00:32:38.760 --> 00:32:40.160]   You're publishing in multiple parts.
[00:32:40.160 --> 00:32:41.520]   Is that what's going on?
[00:32:41.520 --> 00:32:42.520]   Yes.
[00:32:42.520 --> 00:32:43.520]   I don't know.
[00:32:43.520 --> 00:32:47.600]   I just handed to my humble city desk editor and she and he don't block it, right?
[00:32:47.600 --> 00:32:50.200]   I mean, you can't block it.
[00:32:50.200 --> 00:32:51.200]   I have no idea.
[00:32:51.200 --> 00:32:52.680]   Email me privately.
[00:32:52.680 --> 00:32:54.720]   We should figure out why that happens.
[00:32:54.720 --> 00:32:55.720]   Okay.
[00:32:55.720 --> 00:32:59.520]   I bet it's something simple that's happening on the SunTime side that we can fix.
[00:32:59.520 --> 00:33:00.520]   Yeah.
[00:33:00.520 --> 00:33:03.720]   Well, no, I mean, we put all the stuff in manually so we get all the data points.
[00:33:03.720 --> 00:33:06.160]   So if it's missing, maybe we just haven't seen it.
[00:33:06.160 --> 00:33:07.160]   I'll tell the team.
[00:33:07.160 --> 00:33:08.160]   I'll tell the team.
[00:33:08.160 --> 00:33:10.520]   Well, that one just hit this morning.
[00:33:10.520 --> 00:33:16.800]   I wrote the broad review the day it released and then this is the 6,000 word total three
[00:33:16.800 --> 00:33:17.800]   parter.
[00:33:17.800 --> 00:33:19.480]   Andy, I'm going to make a commitment to you.
[00:33:19.480 --> 00:33:23.040]   By the time the show is done, your review will be on catch.
[00:33:23.040 --> 00:33:24.040]   Very much awesome.
[00:33:24.040 --> 00:33:27.320]   I like a commitment to you to buy you coffee and a scone the next time you're in the England
[00:33:27.320 --> 00:33:28.320]   area.
[00:33:28.320 --> 00:33:29.320]   All right.
[00:33:29.320 --> 00:33:30.880]   Now, it's starting out at Starbucks.
[00:33:30.880 --> 00:33:33.000]   I can't afford that, but I will take you to a supermarket nearby.
[00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:35.760]   The coffee is free and they have a bakery department.
[00:33:35.760 --> 00:33:36.760]   Yay.
[00:33:36.760 --> 00:33:37.760]   Yay.
[00:33:37.760 --> 00:33:40.880]   We're brought to you today by our friends at Ford Motor Company.
[00:33:40.880 --> 00:33:43.040]   Every time I get my Mustang, I thank Ford.
[00:33:43.040 --> 00:33:44.480]   That's a little, what is that?
[00:33:44.480 --> 00:33:46.000]   Brave New World.
[00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:48.840]   Thank Ford for the fabulous Mustang.
[00:33:48.840 --> 00:33:55.440]   Here's a picture at sortsocial.com of two guys living under their Ford truck.
[00:33:55.440 --> 00:33:58.640]   Not recommended, but there they are.
[00:33:58.640 --> 00:34:04.640]   They have an F350 and actually this is, I have to say, I love this site now.
[00:34:04.640 --> 00:34:07.240]   Ford has decided, let's see if we can do a social site.
[00:34:07.240 --> 00:34:10.000]   So they've got content, which I think is really smart.
[00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:11.000]   There's lots of articles.
[00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:12.560]   I even wrote an article here for them.
[00:34:12.560 --> 00:34:14.520]   They said, "Leo, would you put, you know, we want to start this new site?"
[00:34:14.520 --> 00:34:16.760]   I said, "I'll be glad to put an article up here for you."
[00:34:16.760 --> 00:34:20.440]   I interviewed, or had interviewed, a guy named Jim Buchkowski.
[00:34:20.440 --> 00:34:25.800]   He is a lead technologist on the sink side and asked him a lot about autonomous vehicles
[00:34:25.800 --> 00:34:28.400]   and the futures of the sink API and all that.
[00:34:28.400 --> 00:34:30.200]   So that article is there.
[00:34:30.200 --> 00:34:34.800]   Lots of articles, hundreds of articles on all different topics, all the different vehicles,
[00:34:34.800 --> 00:34:38.480]   technologies, auto shows, you know, corporate.
[00:34:38.480 --> 00:34:43.760]   You know, if you just want to be impressed, read about their philanthropic arm.
[00:34:43.760 --> 00:34:45.840]   Ford does amazing stuff.
[00:34:45.840 --> 00:34:46.840]   But they're not here.
[00:34:46.840 --> 00:34:47.840]   I'm not here to toot their horn.
[00:34:47.840 --> 00:34:48.840]   They didn't ask me to do that, but I did want to mention that.
[00:34:48.840 --> 00:34:52.840]   They have an idea section where you could submit your ideas.
[00:34:52.840 --> 00:34:54.840]   I hope William B wins on this one.
[00:34:54.840 --> 00:34:56.840]   Here's a recent user posted idea.
[00:34:56.840 --> 00:35:11.120]   "Replace the windshield with a 4K LED flat panel HD display with night vision capability.
[00:35:11.120 --> 00:35:13.600]   The vehicle exterior, just have a sheet metal covering."
[00:35:13.600 --> 00:35:15.080]   This is like, isn't that Judge Dred?
[00:35:15.080 --> 00:35:17.400]   Isn't that how he works?
[00:35:17.400 --> 00:35:18.400]   All sorts of ideas.
[00:35:18.400 --> 00:35:21.600]   You can go in there, read the ideas, post your own ideas, vote on ideas, look at images
[00:35:21.600 --> 00:35:30.360]   from Ford owners and videos to and stories from Ford owners about their vehicles.
[00:35:30.360 --> 00:35:33.280]   It's a really great way to become to be part of the Ford family.
[00:35:33.280 --> 00:35:34.840]   And then grab a badge.
[00:35:34.840 --> 00:35:37.160]   I'm making a sash for all my Ford badges.
[00:35:37.160 --> 00:35:39.080]   I got the Mustang badge.
[00:35:39.080 --> 00:35:42.080]   I got the I Drive 1 badge.
[00:35:42.080 --> 00:35:43.720]   And now I want the tech geek badge.
[00:35:43.720 --> 00:35:44.720]   You're not just ahead of the curve.
[00:35:44.720 --> 00:35:45.720]   You're the one leading it.
[00:35:45.720 --> 00:35:46.720]   Find out more.
[00:35:46.720 --> 00:35:53.520]   Social.Ford.com and you know what the good news is, the 2013 Fusions are out.
[00:35:53.520 --> 00:35:55.840]   Find one at a Ford dealer near you.
[00:35:55.840 --> 00:35:57.000]   They are amazing.
[00:35:57.000 --> 00:35:58.720]   The hybrid and the plug and hybrid.
[00:35:58.720 --> 00:35:59.720]   The energy.
[00:35:59.720 --> 00:36:01.000]   Ooh, I can't wait.
[00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:04.920]   Go further and afford.
[00:36:04.920 --> 00:36:06.680]   We're talking Macintosh.
[00:36:06.680 --> 00:36:07.840]   Yeah, that's it.
[00:36:07.840 --> 00:36:12.160]   That's the ticket and a little bit iPhone, a little bit iOS.
[00:36:12.160 --> 00:36:13.760]   What do the new iPods come out soon?
[00:36:13.760 --> 00:36:16.160]   Anybody got one yet?
[00:36:16.160 --> 00:36:17.160]   I want one.
[00:36:17.160 --> 00:36:18.680]   Would they say mid October?
[00:36:18.680 --> 00:36:19.680]   October.
[00:36:19.680 --> 00:36:20.680]   That's all October.
[00:36:20.680 --> 00:36:21.680]   They said October October, yeah.
[00:36:21.680 --> 00:36:25.040]   Either of you got invitations to an event about the mini?
[00:36:25.040 --> 00:36:29.800]   I think you would know if invitations went out.
[00:36:29.800 --> 00:36:31.800]   They'd be all up lastered all over the pages.
[00:36:31.800 --> 00:36:32.800]   Yeah.
[00:36:32.800 --> 00:36:33.800]   No invitations yet.
[00:36:33.800 --> 00:36:36.160]   Everybody gets invitations all week before.
[00:36:36.160 --> 00:36:37.160]   It's a week.
[00:36:37.160 --> 00:36:39.360]   It's literally seven days before.
[00:36:39.360 --> 00:36:45.200]   So they've done like eight when if they've had to do an event like on a Monday or something
[00:36:45.200 --> 00:36:46.200]   like that.
[00:36:46.200 --> 00:36:48.720]   I mean, I'd send it out on like the Friday or whatever.
[00:36:48.720 --> 00:36:50.720]   Sometimes eight, but really not.
[00:36:50.720 --> 00:36:56.040]   Is there a consensus on date or do we not know?
[00:36:56.040 --> 00:36:59.160]   I'm starting to think that October is not going to happen.
[00:36:59.160 --> 00:37:00.160]   Oh, interesting.
[00:37:00.160 --> 00:37:05.360]   And I'm kind of embarrassed that it didn't occur to me until about a week after the iPhone
[00:37:05.360 --> 00:37:09.320]   5 event that here they are talking about all kinds of products that are not going
[00:37:09.320 --> 00:37:13.720]   to ship until October, neither of which I'm talking about the new iTunes version, the
[00:37:13.720 --> 00:37:17.080]   iTunes store, the new version of iTunes.
[00:37:17.080 --> 00:37:21.480]   It just late occurred to me that if Apple knew that they were doing an event in October,
[00:37:21.480 --> 00:37:25.840]   I think they would have saved that those two announcements for that event, especially
[00:37:25.840 --> 00:37:29.440]   given how overloaded the iPhone 5 announcement already was.
[00:37:29.440 --> 00:37:31.960]   So I was baffled that they did the iPod.
[00:37:31.960 --> 00:37:36.200]   I was baffled they did the iPod announcement in app as kind of a one more thing to the
[00:37:36.200 --> 00:37:37.200]   iPhone.
[00:37:37.200 --> 00:37:39.600]   Any sense to me at all?
[00:37:39.600 --> 00:37:42.720]   Oh, no, they say the headliner for the for the end.
[00:37:42.720 --> 00:37:47.320]   The only the only star bigger than the iPhone 5 was what was of course the Foo Fighters.
[00:37:47.320 --> 00:37:53.720]   So but to your point, if you've got an event coming up, which is in October, why not?
[00:37:53.720 --> 00:37:55.640]   And they've and the stuff isn't available to them.
[00:37:55.640 --> 00:37:56.640]   Why not wait?
[00:37:56.640 --> 00:37:57.640]   Yeah.
[00:37:57.640 --> 00:37:59.880]   So it doesn't make sense.
[00:37:59.880 --> 00:38:04.360]   If it is going to be a town hall event, which is where they do it on campus at a very
[00:38:04.360 --> 00:38:06.400]   small, you know, the very small town hall.
[00:38:06.400 --> 00:38:09.000]   We wouldn't know the date because they don't have the reserve.
[00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:11.680]   Yeah, well, it would be I don't know.
[00:38:11.680 --> 00:38:17.800]   It's tricky because the the leaks for the event at the EuBwenna Center for the iPhone
[00:38:17.800 --> 00:38:23.960]   and the iPods that supposedly came from inside Apple, that wasn't from the EuBwenna Center.
[00:38:23.960 --> 00:38:27.840]   But if it was a town hall event for the iPad mini, the iPad seven inch, whatever it's going
[00:38:27.840 --> 00:38:33.400]   to be called, you know, I think that they could still encapsulate that and just talk
[00:38:33.400 --> 00:38:38.280]   only about that thing and have that be separate from the other stuff.
[00:38:38.280 --> 00:38:39.720]   I think it's possible.
[00:38:39.720 --> 00:38:44.960]   I agree though that Andy has some pretty good points about, you know, how they how they're
[00:38:44.960 --> 00:38:46.280]   going to go about launching this stuff.
[00:38:46.280 --> 00:38:51.600]   The problem is if they announce it in say November, it's got to be really early November
[00:38:51.600 --> 00:38:55.640]   and they've got to be ready to ship that thing because it needs to be out with as much
[00:38:55.640 --> 00:38:59.720]   possible time in advance for the holidays, especially if they need to get through any
[00:38:59.720 --> 00:39:04.960]   kind of early supply problems and, you know, make sure that everyone who wants to get
[00:39:04.960 --> 00:39:06.800]   one of these for the holidays can't.
[00:39:06.800 --> 00:39:07.800]   Yeah.
[00:39:07.800 --> 00:39:12.920]   The other thing is that we were all familiar with just like, you know, the sailor doesn't
[00:39:12.920 --> 00:39:17.320]   see doesn't see the shore over the horizon, but they see seabirds and they realize that,
[00:39:17.320 --> 00:39:19.880]   okay, this means that we must be near land.
[00:39:19.880 --> 00:39:21.760]   There are a whole bunch of early warning signs.
[00:39:21.760 --> 00:39:26.120]   We get that something is imminent and I'm not I haven't been seeing a lot of those about
[00:39:26.120 --> 00:39:30.360]   an iPad announcement, although was it just today or just yesterday that we got our first
[00:39:30.360 --> 00:39:36.880]   purported parts from the from a mini iPad surface, not like a mockup, but this purports
[00:39:36.880 --> 00:39:40.560]   to be the back plate from from an iPad mini here.
[00:39:40.560 --> 00:39:44.720]   It has cutouts for for a camera has cutouts for a micros, a nano sim slot.
[00:39:44.720 --> 00:39:47.640]   It's a front bezel that might be from an iPad mini.
[00:39:47.640 --> 00:39:52.600]   It's stuff like that that seemed more solid that I tend to I tend to associate with.
[00:39:52.600 --> 00:39:54.400]   Okay, I think this is going to be very, very real.
[00:39:54.400 --> 00:40:00.080]   I'm I'm nowhere near blocking out anytime in October for for an iPad mini event.
[00:40:00.080 --> 00:40:01.080]   But do you?
[00:40:01.080 --> 00:40:02.080]   I don't know.
[00:40:02.080 --> 00:40:03.080]   I don't know.
[00:40:03.080 --> 00:40:06.280]   I should I feel a miss for not pressing.
[00:40:06.280 --> 00:40:07.640]   I don't know anything for sure.
[00:40:07.640 --> 00:40:12.120]   But this is I'm starting to believe that if it happens, this year it won't happen in
[00:40:12.120 --> 00:40:13.120]   October.
[00:40:13.120 --> 00:40:19.040]   Here's the pictures from from website, a very respected website Ukrainian iPhone.com.
[00:40:19.040 --> 00:40:25.320]   I kind of wonder if we're not a little bit spoiled though because the iPhone 5 launch
[00:40:25.320 --> 00:40:32.600]   was preceded by perhaps the longest largest, most detailed string of Apple leaks in the
[00:40:32.600 --> 00:40:35.360]   history of modern Apple products.
[00:40:35.360 --> 00:40:41.480]   I mean, we we've never seen something so thoroughly leaked as the iPhone 5 just up
[00:40:41.480 --> 00:40:43.880]   and down, left and right.
[00:40:43.880 --> 00:40:48.160]   Every piece, every internal component, how they all fit together when the launch date
[00:40:48.160 --> 00:40:49.160]   was.
[00:40:49.160 --> 00:40:52.080]   The only thing we didn't know was who was going to be the musician at the end.
[00:40:52.080 --> 00:40:53.080]   Right.
[00:40:53.080 --> 00:40:54.080]   That was the surprise.
[00:40:54.080 --> 00:40:55.920]   Even even the headphones.
[00:40:55.920 --> 00:40:58.000]   Yeah, even the headphones.
[00:40:58.000 --> 00:40:59.000]   Yeah.
[00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:00.000]   Yeah.
[00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:03.400]   So this I'm looking at these pictures and they actually does look fairly credible.
[00:41:03.400 --> 00:41:13.840]   I mean, this is a pretty good fake if it's a fake 7.85 inch iPad with in cell touch.
[00:41:13.840 --> 00:41:16.520]   At least I guess on the iPad 2 design.
[00:41:16.520 --> 00:41:18.440]   We'll see.
[00:41:18.440 --> 00:41:23.520]   Will the world crumble if it does if Apple does not release a mini iPad?
[00:41:23.520 --> 00:41:24.520]   Yes.
[00:41:24.520 --> 00:41:25.520]   It will.
[00:41:25.520 --> 00:41:26.520]   It will crumble.
[00:41:26.520 --> 00:41:27.520]   Okay.
[00:41:27.520 --> 00:41:30.280]   It could it could bring on the Mayan apocalypse two months later.
[00:41:30.280 --> 00:41:31.280]   Yes.
[00:41:31.280 --> 00:41:32.280]   Yeah.
[00:41:32.280 --> 00:41:33.280]   Okay.
[00:41:33.280 --> 00:41:34.280]   Just checking.
[00:41:34.280 --> 00:41:35.280]   Yes.
[00:41:35.280 --> 00:41:36.280]   If that's come here, you'll know why.
[00:41:36.280 --> 00:41:37.280]   It's because of that.
[00:41:37.280 --> 00:41:41.200]   I mean, the good news is that there have been two eight inch tablets that have gotten a
[00:41:41.200 --> 00:41:43.560]   lot of very positive attention.
[00:41:43.560 --> 00:41:50.280]   But that said, as good as the reviews for the for the Nexus 7 tablet where I I've probably
[00:41:50.280 --> 00:41:56.960]   seen maybe three out in the field as good as the reviews of the Kindle Fire HD where
[00:41:56.960 --> 00:41:58.560]   and I really like that device.
[00:41:58.560 --> 00:42:01.840]   I've seen them among people who are using book readers.
[00:42:01.840 --> 00:42:05.880]   But again, I've maybe seen a half dozen to maybe a dozen of those out in the real world.
[00:42:05.880 --> 00:42:10.360]   So it's not as though there's an urgent need for Apple to get a native tablet out this
[00:42:10.360 --> 00:42:11.360]   year.
[00:42:11.360 --> 00:42:15.640]   I'm sure I do believe that it's it's high on their agenda.
[00:42:15.640 --> 00:42:22.720]   I do believe that if I don't doubt that they have a desire to have something out this year,
[00:42:22.720 --> 00:42:26.600]   but I don't see that sense of urgency that would say, Oh my God, if Apple doesn't, there
[00:42:26.600 --> 00:42:31.400]   will be people who no doubt will say, Well, this is the let the let the mark be placed
[00:42:31.400 --> 00:42:36.840]   on this part of the ground of December 2012 when they failed to ship a smaller version
[00:42:36.840 --> 00:42:40.640]   of the iPad tablet was the beginning of the end for Apple's like, no, it wasn't.
[00:42:40.640 --> 00:42:43.440]   You're just being you're just making noises with your mouth.
[00:42:43.440 --> 00:42:46.680]   You're not saying anything smart or clever, interesting or useful.
[00:42:46.680 --> 00:42:51.560]   This never would have happened had Steve Jobs been here or Steve Bishemy.
[00:42:51.560 --> 00:42:53.760]   Steve Bishemy were the head of Apple.
[00:42:53.760 --> 00:42:54.760]   Wow.
[00:42:54.760 --> 00:42:55.760]   He'd know how to do it.
[00:42:55.760 --> 00:42:57.760]   He would have straightened from guys out.
[00:42:57.760 --> 00:43:00.040]   Yeah, take care of it.
[00:43:00.040 --> 00:43:02.000]   Interesting take on Tim Cook's apology.
[00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:05.360]   Now this is the first time Mac break weeklies happened since the apology, but we've been
[00:43:05.360 --> 00:43:07.640]   talking about it because it happened last week.
[00:43:07.640 --> 00:43:11.320]   We talked about it on Twitch and every show that we do, we talked about it, but Tim Cook
[00:43:11.320 --> 00:43:16.360]   on the Apple website post has posted a letter apologizing saying we screwed up map sucks
[00:43:16.360 --> 00:43:23.160]   and you should use Bing or Google on the web or motion X GPS, which was I think fairly
[00:43:23.160 --> 00:43:24.160]   unprecedented.
[00:43:24.160 --> 00:43:27.760]   But here's an interesting take from Farhad Manju writing for Pando daily.
[00:43:27.760 --> 00:43:30.160]   Map gate is gate is over.
[00:43:30.160 --> 00:43:31.800]   Apple won.
[00:43:31.800 --> 00:43:34.480]   There's one Google not so much.
[00:43:34.480 --> 00:43:42.800]   He said that Tim Cook's heartfelt apology really did the job that this was not something
[00:43:42.800 --> 00:43:44.880]   Steve would have done.
[00:43:44.880 --> 00:43:49.880]   It illustrates that Tim Cook's Apple is a more clear eyed pragmatic and not that it's
[00:43:49.880 --> 00:43:54.440]   important, but it's not nothing a nicer place.
[00:43:54.440 --> 00:43:59.040]   Did Tim Cook fix the problem with his apology?
[00:43:59.040 --> 00:44:00.400]   Oh, absolutely.
[00:44:00.400 --> 00:44:01.400]   You don't.
[00:44:01.400 --> 00:44:06.920]   I don't think anybody who knew the situation was going to say that that map should have
[00:44:06.920 --> 00:44:08.760]   worked perfectly out the gate.
[00:44:08.760 --> 00:44:12.720]   The sort of problems that we saw were the sort of problems that you would have anticipated.
[00:44:12.720 --> 00:44:16.880]   It's just nice to see a company instead of just bulldog their way through it and blame
[00:44:16.880 --> 00:44:20.080]   the users or pretend that nobody is having a problem with it.
[00:44:20.080 --> 00:44:21.720]   Really it's customers.
[00:44:21.720 --> 00:44:23.960]   It's good customer service in any industry.
[00:44:23.960 --> 00:44:28.320]   That times the only thing the customer wants you to do is to acknowledge that we screwed
[00:44:28.320 --> 00:44:29.320]   up.
[00:44:29.320 --> 00:44:34.600]   We're in convenience and we can't give you $10,000 in your own show for driver to take
[00:44:34.600 --> 00:44:36.360]   you to the place where you wanted to go.
[00:44:36.360 --> 00:44:40.000]   But here is at least some practical advice that shows that we know exactly how badly
[00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:42.080]   we screwed up and it's going to get better.
[00:44:42.080 --> 00:44:46.760]   That's good for staying on the service line for another 45 minutes waiting for an operator.
[00:44:46.760 --> 00:44:49.880]   If you know that someone is actually listening to you and they're actually care about your
[00:44:49.880 --> 00:44:50.880]   problem.
[00:44:50.880 --> 00:44:51.880]   It costs you nothing.
[00:44:51.880 --> 00:44:52.880]   It costs them.
[00:44:52.880 --> 00:44:54.840]   How much did it cost Tim Cook to put up that email?
[00:44:54.840 --> 00:44:55.840]   Nothing.
[00:44:55.840 --> 00:44:56.840]   Nothing.
[00:44:56.840 --> 00:44:57.840]   Nothing.
[00:44:57.840 --> 00:44:58.840]   Nothing.
[00:44:58.840 --> 00:44:59.840]   Nothing.
[00:44:59.840 --> 00:45:00.840]   That's a bad thing.
[00:45:00.840 --> 00:45:01.840]   It's not a bad thing.
[00:45:01.840 --> 00:45:02.840]   That's a bad thing.
[00:45:02.840 --> 00:45:03.840]   That's a bad thing.
[00:45:03.840 --> 00:45:04.840]   That's a bad thing.
[00:45:04.840 --> 00:45:13.520]   That's the tone of an apple that does not have its ego tied in with its successes and
[00:45:13.520 --> 00:45:15.000]   its failures.
[00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:16.480]   It's either a success or it's a failure.
[00:45:16.480 --> 00:45:17.880]   It doesn't make them terrible people.
[00:45:17.880 --> 00:45:21.760]   It costs them nothing to admit that we could have done, but we wish that it had been better
[00:45:21.760 --> 00:45:22.760]   at this point.
[00:45:22.760 --> 00:45:23.760]   It isn't, but it's going to get better.
[00:45:23.760 --> 00:45:25.760]   You agree, Paran?
[00:45:25.760 --> 00:45:26.760]   I do.
[00:45:26.760 --> 00:45:28.120]   I do agree with all that stuff.
[00:45:28.120 --> 00:45:33.880]   I have to ask a question though that totally goes against the conversation we just had about
[00:45:33.880 --> 00:45:37.160]   what would Steve Jobs do and all that crap that is just so irritating.
[00:45:37.160 --> 00:45:38.160]   Let me ask.
[00:45:38.160 --> 00:45:39.400]   How about us?
[00:45:39.400 --> 00:45:41.360]   However, hear me out.
[00:45:41.360 --> 00:45:44.200]   Hear me out on this.
[00:45:44.200 --> 00:45:51.400]   Tim Cook had really no problem getting behind the new Apple Maps and iOS 6 as being the
[00:45:51.400 --> 00:45:54.840]   most powerful mapping solution in the world.
[00:45:54.840 --> 00:45:56.560]   That was how they went out with it.
[00:45:56.560 --> 00:46:03.800]   There's been a lot of criticism about Apple was maybe a little bit too gung-ho about the
[00:46:03.800 --> 00:46:06.000]   quality of this mapping product.
[00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:11.040]   They should have been a little more realistic about its shortcomings and labeled it a beta,
[00:46:11.040 --> 00:46:15.760]   like they did with Siri and not really just gone out claiming this is good as Google Maps.
[00:46:15.760 --> 00:46:18.600]   My question is this.
[00:46:18.600 --> 00:46:27.840]   Is this a Cook Jobs thing where maybe Jobs, who obviously was known for being far more stringent
[00:46:27.840 --> 00:46:33.080]   about the quality of products, would he have recognized that Maps was not where it should
[00:46:33.080 --> 00:46:39.440]   have been and done more to put a beta label on it and not go out guns of blazing that
[00:46:39.440 --> 00:46:47.160]   this is the best mapping product ever created versus Tim, who was fine to sign off on that.
[00:46:47.160 --> 00:46:51.920]   Is it possible this really could have been avoided with somebody who paid closer attention,
[00:46:51.920 --> 00:46:54.080]   I guess, to the ultimate quality of the product?
[00:46:54.080 --> 00:46:56.240]   Maybe the blame goes to Scott's Forestall.
[00:46:56.240 --> 00:46:59.760]   It was Scott Forestall who took the stage and said this is the best Maps ever.
[00:46:59.760 --> 00:47:01.840]   It's going to be incredible.
[00:47:01.840 --> 00:47:07.480]   Scott Forestall, who did the same for Siri, some are saying Scott Forestall is the guy
[00:47:07.480 --> 00:47:10.720]   who should take the blame for this.
[00:47:10.720 --> 00:47:11.720]   I'm not even going to guess.
[00:47:11.720 --> 00:47:13.720]   That's so inside baseball.
[00:47:13.720 --> 00:47:19.960]   And from the consumer point of view, the consumer doesn't care whether there's a Scaramouche inside
[00:47:19.960 --> 00:47:22.120]   Apple's executive board or whatever.
[00:47:22.120 --> 00:47:24.200]   But this show is not for the consumer.
[00:47:24.200 --> 00:47:28.920]   In fact, the consumer may not know that there was a problem with Maps.
[00:47:28.920 --> 00:47:32.720]   I guess they must have by now until Tim Cook apologized.
[00:47:32.720 --> 00:47:39.240]   That would be the argument against apologizing is, "Shh, it's name on the apps, me."
[00:47:39.240 --> 00:47:44.640]   I will say that every company really has to adapt and change based on how well its work
[00:47:44.640 --> 00:47:47.360]   is received and how well it works actually turns out.
[00:47:47.360 --> 00:47:52.960]   Microsoft got a lot of really snarky comments when they started showing off Windows 8 early,
[00:47:52.960 --> 00:47:57.960]   when they started showing off Microsoft Surface early saying, "Oh, Apple would never do this.
[00:47:57.960 --> 00:48:00.680]   They will show you a finished polished product."
[00:48:00.680 --> 00:48:03.960]   When really that's actually part of Microsoft's process.
[00:48:03.960 --> 00:48:07.440]   They've done this with every edition of Windows where they say, "Here is, if you want to download
[00:48:07.440 --> 00:48:10.320]   it for free a year in advance, buy all means and please tell us what..."
[00:48:10.320 --> 00:48:11.480]   Long public bet is.
[00:48:11.480 --> 00:48:12.480]   That's fantastic.
[00:48:12.480 --> 00:48:13.480]   Please tell us what we screwed up.
[00:48:13.480 --> 00:48:18.760]   In Windows 8, the version that I have on my tablet right now is not quite the same thing
[00:48:18.760 --> 00:48:21.280]   that as I downloaded for the first time.
[00:48:21.280 --> 00:48:24.840]   And so at least the problems are at least out there.
[00:48:24.840 --> 00:48:26.600]   They could be addressed a little bit firmly.
[00:48:26.600 --> 00:48:30.880]   When you just are going to just pull the sheet off and go, "Tada!"
[00:48:30.880 --> 00:48:32.360]   You never really know what you're going to get.
[00:48:32.360 --> 00:48:35.520]   Apple has an incredible track record for that.
[00:48:35.520 --> 00:48:40.440]   Can you imagine a product launch as radical as the iPhone that was as successful as the
[00:48:40.440 --> 00:48:41.440]   iPhone?
[00:48:41.440 --> 00:48:42.920]   Successful product is the iPhone.
[00:48:42.920 --> 00:48:46.840]   But I think that if Apple takes any lesson from Siri and from Maps, it's that there's
[00:48:46.840 --> 00:48:49.280]   sometimes value in saying that, "You know what?
[00:48:49.280 --> 00:48:52.440]   Rather than holding on to this for a year and a half until we think it's perfect, we're
[00:48:52.440 --> 00:48:55.800]   going to let you play with it with some warnings, but we're going to let you play with it because
[00:48:55.800 --> 00:48:58.680]   we're really proud of it and we really want it to be all it can be and we want it to be
[00:48:58.680 --> 00:49:01.440]   as good as it can be as fast as we can make it that way."
[00:49:01.440 --> 00:49:02.440]   They did that with Siri.
[00:49:02.440 --> 00:49:03.440]   Siri's still in beta.
[00:49:03.440 --> 00:49:08.200]   I mean, Siri, when you get the phone out of the box, you have to go into the settings
[00:49:08.200 --> 00:49:09.720]   and enable it by hand.
[00:49:09.720 --> 00:49:11.000]   It doesn't just come on.
[00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:14.960]   Well, maybe it doesn't the iPhone 5, but in the 4S, it didn't just come and enable it
[00:49:14.960 --> 00:49:15.960]   out of the box.
[00:49:15.960 --> 00:49:20.440]   You had to go in there and you had to turn Siri on like three menus deep.
[00:49:20.440 --> 00:49:23.960]   I think the thing here is we're talking about what does it cost Apple to do this?
[00:49:23.960 --> 00:49:27.000]   What does it cost Apple to have Tim Cook apologize?
[00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:28.000]   Nothing.
[00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:32.720]   What would it have cost it Apple to say that Maps was in beta and we've got some work
[00:49:32.720 --> 00:49:35.480]   to do and we hope you bear with us?
[00:49:35.480 --> 00:49:36.760]   It would have cost nothing.
[00:49:36.760 --> 00:49:44.920]   It would have saved so much of just general headache and complaining from the press to
[00:49:44.920 --> 00:49:47.880]   have just been a little bit more realistic about this.
[00:49:47.880 --> 00:49:51.880]   Apple knows better too because they know that their services, their internet services
[00:49:51.880 --> 00:49:58.360]   specifically have always been their weakest form of product and they should have known
[00:49:58.360 --> 00:50:03.800]   that if they hadn't really tested this to the extent that Google has been tested over
[00:50:03.800 --> 00:50:07.400]   the last 10 years, that there were going to be some issues.
[00:50:07.400 --> 00:50:08.400]   Okay.
[00:50:08.400 --> 00:50:11.520]   Perhaps strike one against Tim Cook.
[00:50:11.520 --> 00:50:14.800]   Kudos for apologizing, but maybe he shouldn't have shipped it in the first place or he should
[00:50:14.800 --> 00:50:15.800]   not have touted it.
[00:50:15.800 --> 00:50:18.960]   No, I do really, I genuinely think they should have shipped it.
[00:50:18.960 --> 00:50:19.960]   They had to get it out.
[00:50:19.960 --> 00:50:20.960]   Yeah.
[00:50:20.960 --> 00:50:21.960]   Well, that was the point.
[00:50:21.960 --> 00:50:24.120]   We have to get people using it or it's not going to be better.
[00:50:24.120 --> 00:50:25.120]   Absolutely.
[00:50:25.120 --> 00:50:26.120]   Exactly.
[00:50:26.120 --> 00:50:27.360]   The same thing is true with Siri.
[00:50:27.360 --> 00:50:30.640]   They really need to actually get millions and millions of people using it.
[00:50:30.640 --> 00:50:33.600]   I'm completely on board with them shipping it early.
[00:50:33.600 --> 00:50:35.960]   I think they had to do it strategically.
[00:50:35.960 --> 00:50:40.640]   You know, Gruber had a really interesting post about the timing of the various contract
[00:50:40.640 --> 00:50:43.760]   negotiations going on between Apple and Google for the maps.
[00:50:43.760 --> 00:50:48.520]   I think that they had to do it otherwise they were going to be in an untenable position.
[00:50:48.520 --> 00:50:49.520]   So I'm totally on board.
[00:50:49.520 --> 00:50:52.880]   I just think they really should not have come out guns of blazing.
[00:50:52.880 --> 00:50:56.360]   This is the best map product ever because it is quantifiably not.
[00:50:56.360 --> 00:51:00.320]   I don't actually think it's as bad as a lot of people say it is, but it's definitely
[00:51:00.320 --> 00:51:02.480]   not the best map product ever.
[00:51:02.480 --> 00:51:06.080]   Isn't it an interesting commentary on the psychology of the consumer though, that there's
[00:51:06.080 --> 00:51:12.520]   a if you were to if you were to sell me a certain gadget for my iPhone and I take it
[00:51:12.520 --> 00:51:14.040]   out of the I paid a hundred bucks for it.
[00:51:14.040 --> 00:51:17.080]   I took it out of the box and it just doesn't work properly.
[00:51:17.080 --> 00:51:18.920]   It doesn't work nearly as well as you said it was.
[00:51:18.920 --> 00:51:20.280]   I'm going to be livid.
[00:51:20.280 --> 00:51:25.720]   However, if you sold it to me as a Kickstarter project where you've been coaching me for
[00:51:25.720 --> 00:51:30.600]   the past year about here is where we are in March and okay, we found out that the tooling
[00:51:30.600 --> 00:51:32.000]   is not going to work for this product.
[00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:34.880]   So we're going to fix it this way and hey, we can someone gave us a great idea.
[00:51:34.880 --> 00:51:37.320]   So we're going to make this adjustment here.
[00:51:37.320 --> 00:51:39.000]   You're a little bit more forgiving.
[00:51:39.000 --> 00:51:41.840]   You're still upset that you spent a hundred bucks on something that's been delayed to
[00:51:41.840 --> 00:51:45.840]   three months, but you appreciate all the work that's going into it.
[00:51:45.840 --> 00:51:50.040]   It's a transparent process where you don't expect it to just arrive on your doorstep
[00:51:50.040 --> 00:51:51.680]   and work like magic.
[00:51:51.680 --> 00:51:54.480]   You at least give that company a little bit more latitude.
[00:51:54.480 --> 00:51:59.060]   So when you do stick a beta sticker on something, here I speak as somebody who's had a beta
[00:51:59.060 --> 00:52:04.080]   sticker on my blog for going on four years.
[00:52:04.080 --> 00:52:07.680]   You win at least, well, hopefully a little bit more than four years were the patience
[00:52:07.680 --> 00:52:10.360]   for the people that you're serving.
[00:52:10.360 --> 00:52:11.440]   Yeah, I don't think it's...
[00:52:11.440 --> 00:52:12.440]   Go ahead.
[00:52:12.440 --> 00:52:13.440]   Go ahead, Lee.
[00:52:13.440 --> 00:52:14.440]   Go ahead.
[00:52:14.440 --> 00:52:16.840]   I don't think I agree with you, Ryan, and I don't think it says bad, perhaps, as it's
[00:52:16.840 --> 00:52:17.840]   been painted to be.
[00:52:17.840 --> 00:52:19.440]   Of course, it depends where you live.
[00:52:19.440 --> 00:52:20.440]   We're in the Bay Area.
[00:52:20.440 --> 00:52:25.640]   It's of course better here than it is probably anywhere.
[00:52:25.640 --> 00:52:28.280]   I don't know if it's as big a black mark.
[00:52:28.280 --> 00:52:32.000]   Farhad Manju says "Intentigate" was worse, and that might be true.
[00:52:32.000 --> 00:52:37.560]   That was a terrible moment, not just for the actual problem, but for, I think, Apple's
[00:52:37.560 --> 00:52:42.480]   response to it, where they were saying that, yes, I know that when you hold this phone
[00:52:42.480 --> 00:52:46.280]   in a way that a lot of people hold the phone, the signal strength visibly drops down to
[00:52:46.280 --> 00:52:47.280]   one.
[00:52:47.280 --> 00:52:51.720]   I can't believe you're being such babies about this and calling it a big problem.
[00:52:51.720 --> 00:52:52.720]   That was...
[00:52:52.720 --> 00:52:53.720]   That's a mistake.
[00:52:53.720 --> 00:52:54.720]   Yeah.
[00:52:54.720 --> 00:52:55.720]   That was...
[00:52:55.720 --> 00:52:57.320]   There was really no answer to that other than, "Okay."
[00:52:57.320 --> 00:53:00.560]   Clearly, we tested this really thoroughly.
[00:53:00.560 --> 00:53:02.920]   Clearly we delivered a product that people aren't happy with.
[00:53:02.920 --> 00:53:05.080]   Here's how we're going to address this.
[00:53:05.080 --> 00:53:06.080]   It wasn't...
[00:53:06.080 --> 00:53:12.400]   You don't want your response to a perceived crisis to be the creation of a brand new meme
[00:53:12.400 --> 00:53:18.080]   that persists years later as a feeble excuse for your... for to cover up your own mistakes.
[00:53:18.080 --> 00:53:21.960]   Even today, it's hard for me to spend like one month without even thinking, "Oh, well,
[00:53:21.960 --> 00:53:23.640]   this because you're holding it wrong."
[00:53:23.640 --> 00:53:24.640]   Right.
[00:53:24.640 --> 00:53:26.480]   Yeah, that became a tagline, didn't it?
[00:53:26.480 --> 00:53:27.480]   You're holding it wrong.
[00:53:27.480 --> 00:53:28.480]   Yeah.
[00:53:28.480 --> 00:53:30.400]   Andy Paragraph 3 of your iPhone review just ends in mid-sentence.
[00:53:30.400 --> 00:53:33.080]   Oh, you're holding it wrong.
[00:53:33.080 --> 00:53:35.840]   Take your thumb off the end.
[00:53:35.840 --> 00:53:40.840]   Farhad Manju also goes on to say that really the loser here is Google, and he has an interesting
[00:53:40.840 --> 00:53:41.840]   point.
[00:53:41.840 --> 00:53:42.840]   He says Google makes a lot more...
[00:53:42.840 --> 00:53:46.600]   Look, Google doesn't care really with you by Android or iPhone, as long as they've got
[00:53:46.600 --> 00:53:51.360]   their products on their... let's not assume Google's a phone company.
[00:53:51.360 --> 00:53:52.920]   It's an advertising company.
[00:53:52.920 --> 00:53:59.200]   And he says that according to Horace Didiou, Google probably makes $6 on every iPhone
[00:53:59.200 --> 00:54:03.800]   annually on ad revenues compared to $2 for Android phones.
[00:54:03.800 --> 00:54:07.920]   Google should have... there's no excuse for saying they didn't know what's going to happen.
[00:54:07.920 --> 00:54:13.880]   Google basically has been announcing this even before the June announcement on WWDC.
[00:54:13.880 --> 00:54:15.720]   Why doesn't Google have a Maps app?
[00:54:15.720 --> 00:54:20.760]   Is it Shadenfreude or is it a failure?
[00:54:20.760 --> 00:54:23.160]   I think it's failure.
[00:54:23.160 --> 00:54:24.160]   Yeah.
[00:54:24.160 --> 00:54:26.080]   I don't think it's them rubbing in it.
[00:54:26.080 --> 00:54:30.320]   Google really doesn't have too much to gain, I think, from doing that.
[00:54:30.320 --> 00:54:31.320]   No.
[00:54:31.320 --> 00:54:35.840]   Yeah, maybe for like a week or two, it makes everybody really glad when Google does release
[00:54:35.840 --> 00:54:37.720]   their Maps app.
[00:54:37.720 --> 00:54:43.200]   But ultimately, they're currently losing a ton of data and a ton of time.
[00:54:43.200 --> 00:54:47.120]   In this industry, the one thing you cannot lose is time.
[00:54:47.120 --> 00:54:49.160]   That is incredibly important and incredibly valuable.
[00:54:49.160 --> 00:54:53.920]   It's the only non-renewable resource, especially for a company like Google who has essentially
[00:54:53.920 --> 00:54:55.720]   infinite money.
[00:54:55.720 --> 00:55:00.120]   They need that time, they need that data, they need to be on the iPhone, they blew it,
[00:55:00.120 --> 00:55:02.560]   and they got to be there yesterday.
[00:55:02.560 --> 00:55:05.440]   And I think Andy and I... and I don't know about you, Ryan, but we haven't been using
[00:55:05.440 --> 00:55:06.440]   Apple's Maps for years.
[00:55:06.440 --> 00:55:12.160]   We've been using Waze and MotionX GPS and many of the other better mapping apps anyway.
[00:55:12.160 --> 00:55:17.600]   So Google missed an opportunity for a lot of people who were using that Maps app to move
[00:55:17.600 --> 00:55:19.320]   over to Google.
[00:55:19.320 --> 00:55:22.800]   And from the point of view, the consumer, there's always been other choices and frankly
[00:55:22.800 --> 00:55:26.120]   better choices for the last few years.
[00:55:26.120 --> 00:55:27.120]   Yeah.
[00:55:27.120 --> 00:55:28.120]   So I know...
[00:55:28.120 --> 00:55:31.440]   I do want to kind of go back to something that Andy was saying though about the consumer
[00:55:31.440 --> 00:55:34.000]   psychology of all this.
[00:55:34.000 --> 00:55:36.800]   And really all it comes down to is just setting expectations.
[00:55:36.800 --> 00:55:37.800]   Right?
[00:55:37.800 --> 00:55:40.400]   I mean, that is all it is at the end of the day.
[00:55:40.400 --> 00:55:47.520]   And you tend to have the most forgiving response when you set expectations low and overdeliver.
[00:55:47.520 --> 00:55:50.600]   And Apple is generally pretty good about doing that at the right moment.
[00:55:50.600 --> 00:55:55.000]   I mean, they set expectations fairly low at the launch of iCloud.
[00:55:55.000 --> 00:55:57.400]   They said, "Look, this is zerly.
[00:55:57.400 --> 00:56:02.480]   We clearly had some issues with mobile me, a product that they set expectations very
[00:56:02.480 --> 00:56:04.840]   high and were not able to deliver on it."
[00:56:04.840 --> 00:56:05.840]   That was a greater flop.
[00:56:05.840 --> 00:56:06.840]   So, geez.
[00:56:06.840 --> 00:56:07.840]   Yeah.
[00:56:07.840 --> 00:56:09.840]   So we thought, I mean, I kind of thought that they would have learned their lesson about
[00:56:09.840 --> 00:56:14.440]   expectations, especially when it comes to services where, you know, again, they've been
[00:56:14.440 --> 00:56:16.480]   historically very weak.
[00:56:16.480 --> 00:56:21.240]   The problem was they set expectations really high and they did nothing to manage those
[00:56:21.240 --> 00:56:23.960]   expectations and then blew up in their face.
[00:56:23.960 --> 00:56:27.800]   Really all they had to do was just be a little more realistic.
[00:56:27.800 --> 00:56:29.680]   And I think that this whole thing would have been avoided.
[00:56:29.680 --> 00:56:36.040]   Yeah, I've said that many times every hardware device, every computer device has problems,
[00:56:36.040 --> 00:56:38.800]   breaks, software breaks.
[00:56:38.800 --> 00:56:41.480]   It's not making a perfect device that's required.
[00:56:41.480 --> 00:56:42.480]   Nobody can.
[00:56:42.480 --> 00:56:45.960]   It's how you handle it when it doesn't work.
[00:56:45.960 --> 00:56:48.560]   And I create lowering expectations up front.
[00:56:48.560 --> 00:56:51.760]   No, you know, if you don't have the best map app, don't go out there and say, "This
[00:56:51.760 --> 00:56:53.800]   is the best map app ever."
[00:56:53.800 --> 00:56:54.800]   Maybe did they not know?
[00:56:54.800 --> 00:56:56.360]   It's got not known.
[00:56:56.360 --> 00:56:57.360]   Maybe they didn't know.
[00:56:57.360 --> 00:56:59.360]   Maybe they thought it was a pass-back.
[00:56:59.360 --> 00:57:01.360]   How's all this?
[00:57:01.360 --> 00:57:04.000]   There's also the showbiz aspect.
[00:57:04.000 --> 00:57:09.600]   When you unveil something in front of 3,000 people, including it was like 600 members of
[00:57:09.600 --> 00:57:14.520]   the press and about 2,000 or 3,000 developers, it's hard to say, "Well, we're going to give
[00:57:14.520 --> 00:57:19.480]   this a try and don't use everything important, but you know, we're going to give it a spin
[00:57:19.480 --> 00:57:21.120]   and report the bugs."
[00:57:21.120 --> 00:57:22.120]   It's showbiz, man.
[00:57:22.120 --> 00:57:24.240]   You get on that stage and you belt it out.
[00:57:24.240 --> 00:57:25.880]   I'm prone to hyperbole.
[00:57:25.880 --> 00:57:26.720]   I understand that.
[00:57:27.440 --> 00:57:28.440]   We all are.
[00:57:28.440 --> 00:57:29.440]   Yeah, you get on it.
[00:57:29.440 --> 00:57:32.760]   This is the best, though most wonderful.
[00:57:32.760 --> 00:57:35.280]   We're going to take a break.
[00:57:35.280 --> 00:57:36.280]   We do have these anecdotes.
[00:57:36.280 --> 00:57:43.160]   I'll read a couple of them for you on the one-year anniversary of Steve Jobs passing at the age
[00:57:43.160 --> 00:57:46.480]   of 56 way too soon.
[00:57:46.480 --> 00:57:51.760]   But before we do that, let's talk a little bit about our great sponsor, Squarespace.com.
[00:57:51.760 --> 00:57:53.200]   If you're ready to do a website.
[00:57:53.200 --> 00:57:58.520]   And by the way, it doesn't have to be like your website, you know, to end all websites.
[00:57:58.520 --> 00:58:01.040]   Maybe there's a wedding or a birth coming up.
[00:58:01.040 --> 00:58:06.680]   Great gift for a newborn would be to get their domain name, you know, get their name
[00:58:06.680 --> 00:58:11.640]   as a domain and create a simple site for the baby announcement that could eventually be
[00:58:11.640 --> 00:58:12.640]   their site.
[00:58:12.640 --> 00:58:14.520]   Wouldn't that be a great gift?
[00:58:14.520 --> 00:58:17.840]   Grandma, grandpa, Squarespace is made for this.
[00:58:17.840 --> 00:58:19.360]   I wanted to take a look at it.
[00:58:19.360 --> 00:58:23.480]   Squarespace.com, it's hosting plus content management software.
[00:58:23.480 --> 00:58:25.720]   So it's the best of both worlds.
[00:58:25.720 --> 00:58:27.720]   And there's a good reason to tie them so tightly together.
[00:58:27.720 --> 00:58:31.320]   You get great performance, automatic security fixes and updates.
[00:58:31.320 --> 00:58:34.240]   So you're, oh, I've never heard of a Squarespace exploit.
[00:58:34.240 --> 00:58:36.840]   You're always absolutely secure.
[00:58:36.840 --> 00:58:38.680]   You don't have to even think about that.
[00:58:38.680 --> 00:58:43.840]   Plus nice little features like for instance, if you want to get the baby name.com, you can
[00:58:43.840 --> 00:58:45.320]   do that with Squarespace.
[00:58:45.320 --> 00:58:48.600]   If you buy an annual plan, they'll automatically do the hookup.
[00:58:48.600 --> 00:58:52.280]   They'll give you, you know, you register the domain name, wire it up so that that domain
[00:58:52.280 --> 00:58:55.320]   name goes to your Squarespace site all for free.
[00:58:55.320 --> 00:58:57.360]   So there's a lot of nice features in Squarespace.
[00:58:57.360 --> 00:59:01.600]   The new Squarespace 6 just came out and it is spectacular.
[00:59:01.600 --> 00:59:08.160]   Things like what they call responsive design, which means that the page is, you don't have
[00:59:08.160 --> 00:59:09.920]   a special mobile page.
[00:59:09.920 --> 00:59:10.920]   Everybody's mobile now.
[00:59:10.920 --> 00:59:16.400]   So you have a single page that rearranges itself that responds to the device you're,
[00:59:16.400 --> 00:59:22.800]   so we're looking at it on from an iPhone to a tablet to an iPad to a 27 inch display.
[00:59:22.800 --> 00:59:27.960]   So when you put an image into your website, it automatically makes multiple thumbnails,
[00:59:27.960 --> 00:59:31.560]   I think seven different thumbnails to fit each kind of display.
[00:59:31.560 --> 00:59:33.200]   The page rearranges itself.
[00:59:33.200 --> 00:59:35.760]   Its templates are all responsive.
[00:59:35.760 --> 00:59:39.880]   And by the way, beautiful designer templates, really gorgeous stuff.
[00:59:39.880 --> 00:59:44.840]   Very easy to take the starting point and make it your own.
[00:59:44.840 --> 00:59:48.680]   Squarespace site looks unique because it's so easy, even if you're not a web designer,
[00:59:48.680 --> 00:59:50.280]   to make it look how you want it to look.
[00:59:50.280 --> 00:59:55.920]   Of course, if you know CSS, JavaScript, HTML5, Squarespace gives you full access to all
[00:59:55.920 --> 01:00:00.600]   those tools, including syntax, color coding and so forth in their editor.
[01:00:00.600 --> 01:00:02.120]   They've got a great pop out editor.
[01:00:02.120 --> 01:00:05.320]   Makes it very easy to do your own CSS.
[01:00:05.320 --> 01:00:08.720]   Import all your data from existing sites, export it back out.
[01:00:08.720 --> 01:00:09.800]   You're never trapped.
[01:00:09.800 --> 01:00:16.680]   You can even embed things like Google Maps automatically easily, Twitter, Flickr, LinkedIn,
[01:00:16.680 --> 01:00:19.040]   Facebook, all of them.
[01:00:19.040 --> 01:00:20.680]   Just couldn't be easier to work with Squarespace.
[01:00:20.680 --> 01:00:22.640]   I want you to visit squarespace.com.
[01:00:22.640 --> 01:00:26.680]   They have a very liberal trial offer.
[01:00:26.680 --> 01:00:28.040]   You don't need a credit card.
[01:00:28.040 --> 01:00:32.320]   You don't need to give them any personal information except an email address and you
[01:00:32.320 --> 01:00:35.720]   can try it free for two weeks and really have the run of the place.
[01:00:35.720 --> 01:00:37.960]   Import your data and see how it would look.
[01:00:37.960 --> 01:00:42.320]   That, by the way, if you've got an event coming up in the next two weeks, that's it.
[01:00:42.320 --> 01:00:47.920]   If it's a block mont, you could just put that on the website there, blockmont.com and
[01:00:47.920 --> 01:00:48.920]   you got the whole thing.
[01:00:48.920 --> 01:00:51.120]   Then two weeks later, it costs you nothing.
[01:00:51.120 --> 01:00:52.880]   You say, "Okay, it's over."
[01:00:52.880 --> 01:00:56.440]   Actually, Leo, it's funny that you say that.
[01:00:56.440 --> 01:01:00.600]   This is totally not planned, but we had a wedding site up.
[01:01:00.600 --> 01:01:04.280]   We were using this wedding service and it was pretty good, but it just wasn't powerful
[01:01:04.280 --> 01:01:05.280]   enough.
[01:01:05.280 --> 01:01:07.480]   I know how to code websites a little.
[01:01:07.480 --> 01:01:08.980]   I'm not amazing.
[01:01:08.980 --> 01:01:13.000]   I'm definitely not a developer anymore, but I didn't want to spend the time building
[01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:15.200]   a website from scratch.
[01:01:15.200 --> 01:01:19.840]   Veronica actually used Squarespace to create our wedding site and it's really good.
[01:01:19.840 --> 01:01:23.080]   I was actually really blown away by the responsive design stuff.
[01:01:23.080 --> 01:01:25.480]   I really was not expecting that.
[01:01:25.480 --> 01:01:27.880]   Editing was just really, really fast and easy.
[01:01:27.880 --> 01:01:29.840]   I was really surprised.
[01:01:29.840 --> 01:01:36.840]   A lot of people, especially in the podcast and video show space are sponsored by Squarespace.
[01:01:36.840 --> 01:01:40.600]   We always hear about how great it is, but I never really sat down and used it and it
[01:01:40.600 --> 01:01:41.600]   was really good.
[01:01:41.600 --> 01:01:42.960]   That is so great.
[01:01:42.960 --> 01:01:45.600]   That is an unsolicited testimonial.
[01:01:45.600 --> 01:01:46.600]   Thank you.
[01:01:46.600 --> 01:01:47.600]   Unsolicited.
[01:01:47.600 --> 01:01:48.600]   Unsolicited.
[01:01:48.600 --> 01:01:52.000]   But you hear these ads after a while, it starts to say, "You know what I mean?
[01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:53.000]   Try this."
[01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:54.000]   Maybe.
[01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:55.440]   I've been doing an ad for 10 years.
[01:01:55.440 --> 01:01:56.440]   Here's the deal.
[01:01:56.440 --> 01:01:57.440]   Go to squarespace.com.
[01:01:57.440 --> 01:01:58.440]   Two weeks free.
[01:01:58.440 --> 01:01:59.440]   You don't need an offer code or anything.
[01:01:59.440 --> 01:02:00.440]   Try it out.
[01:02:00.440 --> 01:02:02.880]   By the way, here's the kiss.
[01:02:02.880 --> 01:02:06.840]   I said I didn't see any pictures, but Roger Chang posted a picture of the kiss.
[01:02:06.840 --> 01:02:08.280]   There you go from the wedding.
[01:02:08.280 --> 01:02:09.440]   I love that.
[01:02:09.440 --> 01:02:12.560]   That's on his Twitter feed.
[01:02:12.560 --> 01:02:13.880]   I want you to try it for free.
[01:02:13.880 --> 01:02:18.960]   If you decide you like it, if you decide you like it, that's when I want you to use
[01:02:18.960 --> 01:02:19.960]   our offer code.
[01:02:19.960 --> 01:02:20.960]   Take a look at the pricing.
[01:02:20.960 --> 01:02:22.560]   It's really sensible pricing.
[01:02:22.560 --> 01:02:24.160]   There's only two plans.
[01:02:24.160 --> 01:02:26.120]   There's the standard plan and the unlimited plan.
[01:02:26.120 --> 01:02:29.440]   You can go month to month if you want, or you can buy a yearly deal.
[01:02:29.440 --> 01:02:31.680]   Of course, you're going to get the best deal if you buy a year.
[01:02:31.680 --> 01:02:34.560]   In fact, I would go for the unlimited yearly deal.
[01:02:34.560 --> 01:02:39.240]   That comes down to $16 a month, and you get unlimited pages, galleries, blogs, unlimited
[01:02:39.240 --> 01:02:42.320]   bandwidth, unlimited storage, unlimited contributors.
[01:02:42.320 --> 01:02:45.560]   You get the custom domain registration I was talking about.
[01:02:45.560 --> 01:02:50.880]   All sorts of fancy integration with Google Apps and MailChimp, published to Facebook
[01:02:50.880 --> 01:02:51.880]   Pay.
[01:02:51.880 --> 01:02:52.880]   I'm going to go on and on.
[01:02:52.880 --> 01:02:57.400]   If you use our offer code, MacBreak10, we change the offer code every month.
[01:02:57.400 --> 01:02:59.200]   Just use the number of the month at the end.
[01:02:59.200 --> 01:03:04.320]   In this case, October MacBreak10, you'll get 10% off your first purchase.
[01:03:04.320 --> 01:03:08.840]   That's why it's another reason to do the annual purchase because it's a significant savings.
[01:03:08.840 --> 01:03:09.840]   Squarespace.com.
[01:03:09.840 --> 01:03:14.960]   If it's good enough for Blockmont, just think what you could do with it.
[01:03:14.960 --> 01:03:15.960]   I love it.
[01:03:15.960 --> 01:03:18.720]   That's how hip you guys are.
[01:03:18.720 --> 01:03:19.720]   Was it official?
[01:03:19.720 --> 01:03:20.720]   Did you announce the hashtag?
[01:03:20.720 --> 01:03:21.720]   Yes, we did.
[01:03:21.720 --> 01:03:24.160]   It was on the wedding program.
[01:03:24.160 --> 01:03:26.880]   We have a lot of people from the technology world there.
[01:03:26.880 --> 01:03:27.880]   It's so funny.
[01:03:27.880 --> 01:03:28.880]   Maybe to know.
[01:03:28.880 --> 01:03:34.640]   Of course, we're not going to put a bunch of crappy little analog film cameras on every
[01:03:34.640 --> 01:03:36.080]   table like they do at some wedding.
[01:03:36.080 --> 01:03:37.600]   Hey, that's what I did at my wedding course.
[01:03:37.600 --> 01:03:39.440]   That was 1992.
[01:03:39.440 --> 01:03:41.280]   We didn't have Twitter.
[01:03:41.280 --> 01:03:45.480]   We are totally forgivable back then, but now everybody has an amazing camera in the
[01:03:45.480 --> 01:03:47.680]   pockets, and we want to see those photographs.
[01:03:47.680 --> 01:03:48.680]   So much easier.
[01:03:48.680 --> 01:03:49.680]   I've got to tell you.
[01:03:49.680 --> 01:03:55.960]   We had to develop 150 disposable cameras to get our pictures back.
[01:03:55.960 --> 01:03:56.960]   And they were all crappy.
[01:03:56.960 --> 01:03:59.360]   They were all pictures of the table.
[01:03:59.360 --> 01:04:01.920]   So this is much better.
[01:04:01.920 --> 01:04:09.160]   I'm just not sure if I would want to spend my most glorious day in life, starting my
[01:04:09.160 --> 01:04:15.680]   life partnership with my beloved, explaining to about at least 11 of my elderly relatives,
[01:04:15.680 --> 01:04:19.640]   "Okay, now you're not on LTE, so you're going to have to walk."
[01:04:19.640 --> 01:04:20.640]   "Why?"
[01:04:20.640 --> 01:04:21.640]   "Why?"
[01:04:21.640 --> 01:04:22.640]   "Why?"
[01:04:22.640 --> 01:04:23.640]   "Why?"
[01:04:23.640 --> 01:04:24.640]   "Your phone has what?"
[01:04:24.640 --> 01:04:25.640]   "Give me your phone."
[01:04:25.640 --> 01:04:26.640]   "I'll download the app."
[01:04:26.640 --> 01:04:27.640]   "It's an app."
[01:04:27.640 --> 01:04:29.640]   "No, it's not."
[01:04:29.640 --> 01:04:30.640]   "Okay."
[01:04:30.640 --> 01:04:31.640]   "It turns out it's..."
[01:04:31.640 --> 01:04:33.640]   I love you.
[01:04:33.640 --> 01:04:35.640]   I'm still behind you.
[01:04:35.640 --> 01:04:39.320]   It's kind of like those like cartoons where they have like, you know, some jokes in there
[01:04:39.320 --> 01:04:42.720]   that they throw in that only the adults are going to get, and like the kid just kind of
[01:04:42.720 --> 01:04:43.720]   goes right over their head.
[01:04:43.720 --> 01:04:45.200]   That's kind of how it was.
[01:04:45.200 --> 01:04:47.920]   All the people who didn't know what we were talking about, they just went right over their
[01:04:47.920 --> 01:04:50.800]   head and we moved it on and, you know, no big deal.
[01:04:50.800 --> 01:04:53.640]   What's this black mind you're talking about?
[01:04:53.640 --> 01:04:59.320]   Anyway, for people who were at home as I was following the story, as it developed, it
[01:04:59.320 --> 01:05:02.440]   was great because you could Google "Blackmont" and the pictures from all over the world.
[01:05:02.440 --> 01:05:06.520]   I don't think it's right that you're asking me to text you.
[01:05:06.520 --> 01:05:07.520]   I read about that.
[01:05:07.520 --> 01:05:08.520]   I saw that on the news.
[01:05:08.520 --> 01:05:11.040]   Jack is sadly talking all about it.
[01:05:11.040 --> 01:05:13.880]   You young people keep sexting each other and talking.
[01:05:13.880 --> 01:05:15.720]   That's not appropriate, John.
[01:05:15.720 --> 01:05:18.640]   No, not at a wedding.
[01:05:18.640 --> 01:05:21.680]   Save it for the honeymoon.
[01:05:21.680 --> 01:05:24.480]   Steve Jobs, 1955 to 2011.
[01:05:24.480 --> 01:05:25.480]   It was October 5th.
[01:05:25.480 --> 01:05:26.840]   Boy, what a day that was.
[01:05:26.840 --> 01:05:27.840]   I'll never forget it.
[01:05:27.840 --> 01:05:30.760]   We were in the middle of triangulation.
[01:05:30.760 --> 01:05:32.000]   I forgot who we were talking to.
[01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:34.240]   It was at Kevin Marks.
[01:05:34.240 --> 01:05:37.040]   And because he'd worked at Apple.
[01:05:37.040 --> 01:05:41.800]   So we started sharing stories and I think we went on for four or five hours talking about
[01:05:41.800 --> 01:05:42.800]   Steve Jobs.
[01:05:42.800 --> 01:05:44.640]   Well, there's lots more stories now.
[01:05:44.640 --> 01:05:48.640]   Johnny Gogelmo has written an article for Forbes Magazine.
[01:05:48.640 --> 01:05:54.080]   Actually, the larger article is on free on Forbes website, Forbes.com.
[01:05:54.080 --> 01:06:00.920]   Untold stories about Steve Jobs, friends and colleagues share their memories.
[01:06:00.920 --> 01:06:08.000]   Software engineer Randy Adams worked at Next with Steve Jobs.
[01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:09.960]   He actually turned down the first offer.
[01:06:09.960 --> 01:06:13.520]   Jobs left a message on his answering machine saying, "You're blowing it, Randy.
[01:06:13.520 --> 01:06:15.040]   This is the opportunity of a lifetime.
[01:06:15.040 --> 01:06:16.400]   You're blowing it."
[01:06:16.400 --> 01:06:19.000]   So Adams took the job.
[01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:23.440]   He bought in Porsche 911 with some of the cashier from the sales of the company as did
[01:06:23.440 --> 01:06:24.440]   Steve Jobs.
[01:06:24.440 --> 01:06:26.240]   They had twin Porsche 911s.
[01:06:26.240 --> 01:06:31.480]   They park him in the parking lot, taking up three spaces to avoid door dings next to each
[01:06:31.480 --> 01:06:32.480]   other.
[01:06:32.480 --> 01:06:34.360]   So Steve said, "Randy, you won't ding my car.
[01:06:34.360 --> 01:06:36.080]   I won't ding your brand new car."
[01:06:36.080 --> 01:06:41.520]   One day, Jobs rushes over to Adams cubicle and says, "We have to move the cars."
[01:06:41.520 --> 01:06:42.520]   Randy says, "Why?"
[01:06:42.520 --> 01:06:43.360]   He says, "Randy."
[01:06:43.360 --> 01:06:45.240]   "We have to hide the Porsches."
[01:06:45.240 --> 01:06:48.840]   Ross Perot's coming by and thinking of investing in Next, and we don't want him to think we
[01:06:48.840 --> 01:06:50.760]   have a lot of money.
[01:06:50.760 --> 01:06:54.400]   They move the cars around to the back of the offices.
[01:06:54.400 --> 01:06:58.640]   Perot later invested $20 million and took a seat on the point.
[01:06:58.640 --> 01:07:04.320]   See, that's the difference between a billionaire entrepreneur and anybody in this conversation.
[01:07:04.320 --> 01:07:05.960]   Hide the Porsches.
[01:07:05.960 --> 01:07:12.000]   See, that is the reason why I had the curtains installed.
[01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:15.760]   She can't see my personal hella jet.
[01:07:15.760 --> 01:07:19.680]   Adams also recalls the time Bill Gates showed up at Next for a meeting in the fall of '86.
[01:07:19.680 --> 01:07:22.280]   The receptionist in the lobby downstairs called Jobs.
[01:07:22.280 --> 01:07:23.280]   His cube was upstairs.
[01:07:23.280 --> 01:07:25.040]   Notice they called it a cube.
[01:07:25.040 --> 01:07:29.440]   To let him know that Gates was in the lobby, Randy says, "I could see him sitting in his
[01:07:29.440 --> 01:07:30.440]   cube.
[01:07:30.440 --> 01:07:35.520]   He wasn't doing anything, but he didn't get up or call Gates or ask him to come up.
[01:07:35.520 --> 01:07:40.800]   In fact, he left him waiting in the lobby for an hour, an hour.
[01:07:40.800 --> 01:07:43.120]   Next engineers went downstairs, talked with Gates.
[01:07:43.120 --> 01:07:44.120]   He said, "We enjoyed it.
[01:07:44.120 --> 01:07:52.960]   It's been an hour talking to him, and still Steve finally called him in."
[01:07:52.960 --> 01:07:59.720]   Apparently at one point Jobs calls Adams as a gold miner.
[01:07:59.720 --> 01:08:02.720]   He calls Adams in to let him know next is going to stop selling workstations.
[01:08:02.720 --> 01:08:05.600]   Remember, they gave up on the hardware and started selling software in the next step
[01:08:05.600 --> 01:08:10.200]   operating system, which became OpenStep and later OS10.
[01:08:10.200 --> 01:08:11.920]   Jobs said, "The cost of hardware is coming down.
[01:08:11.920 --> 01:08:13.720]   We think it's a commodity."
[01:08:13.720 --> 01:08:15.640]   I said, "Why don't you sell PCs then?"
[01:08:15.640 --> 01:08:20.360]   Jobs said, "I would rather sell dog poop than sell PCs."
[01:08:20.360 --> 01:08:21.360]   Apparently...
[01:08:21.360 --> 01:08:24.440]   That was the word he used, right?
[01:08:24.440 --> 01:08:26.600]   Yeah, it's exactly poop.
[01:08:26.600 --> 01:08:31.120]   Apparently Jobs, who was a vegan, would pass by engineers eating subway sandwiches and say,
[01:08:31.120 --> 01:08:33.760]   "Oh, the smell of burnt animal flesh.
[01:08:33.760 --> 01:08:35.400]   How delightful."
[01:08:35.400 --> 01:08:38.280]   He was one of those.
[01:08:38.280 --> 01:08:42.880]   Yet he would dress up as Santa Claus at Christmas and hand out $100 bills.
[01:08:42.880 --> 01:08:43.880]   It's funny.
[01:08:43.880 --> 01:08:44.880]   Peter's a vegan.
[01:08:44.880 --> 01:08:45.880]   That's exactly what he does whenever he visits.
[01:08:45.880 --> 01:08:46.880]   Does he?
[01:08:46.880 --> 01:08:47.880]   It's the SF office.
[01:08:47.880 --> 01:08:48.880]   God, dead animals.
[01:08:48.880 --> 01:08:51.880]   They're going to say he has $100 bills.
[01:08:51.880 --> 01:08:52.880]   Adams by the rough.
[01:08:52.880 --> 01:08:53.880]   Peter's a good vegan.
[01:08:53.880 --> 01:08:54.880]   He's a good vegan.
[01:08:54.880 --> 01:08:55.880]   He's not preachy.
[01:08:55.880 --> 01:08:57.480]   He's not preachy.
[01:08:57.480 --> 01:08:58.480]   The good vegans.
[01:08:58.480 --> 01:09:03.800]   Sometimes he does throw animal blood on me, but besides that, not a big deal.
[01:09:03.800 --> 01:09:06.400]   Connie tells a story herself about the mini Apple store.
[01:09:06.400 --> 01:09:12.320]   This is a famous store that they opened before they had the regular Apple stores in Palo
[01:09:12.320 --> 01:09:14.560]   Alto.
[01:09:14.560 --> 01:09:22.120]   It had white, like glossy white floors and metal walls, Japanese stainless steel walls
[01:09:22.120 --> 01:09:24.520]   with little holes to echo the Mac Pro in it.
[01:09:24.520 --> 01:09:32.880]   It was a very high concept store.
[01:09:32.880 --> 01:09:37.160]   Jobs apparently, she says, she saw him through the curtain having a meltdown.
[01:09:37.160 --> 01:09:40.320]   Refusing in the minutes before the unveiling of step outside and greet reporters.
[01:09:40.320 --> 01:09:41.320]   Why?
[01:09:41.320 --> 01:09:44.960]   Because the store design that looked so great on paper didn't stand up to real world use.
[01:09:44.960 --> 01:09:50.920]   The walls showed off every hand print and the floors were marred by black scuff marks
[01:09:50.920 --> 01:09:53.520]   from people who had been readying the store for the big reveal.
[01:09:53.520 --> 01:09:57.040]   Eventually, Jobs was convinced to step outside the curtain was drawn when I saw the floor
[01:09:57.040 --> 01:10:01.600]   says, "Guliamo," I immediately turned to Job Standing next to me and said, "Were you
[01:10:01.600 --> 01:10:03.600]   involved in every aspect of the design?"
[01:10:03.600 --> 01:10:06.720]   Job said, "Yes."
[01:10:06.720 --> 01:10:10.760]   She said to him, "It's obvious whoever designed the store has never cleaned a floor in his
[01:10:10.760 --> 01:10:11.760]   life."
[01:10:11.760 --> 01:10:14.920]   She says he narrowed his eyes and stepped inside.
[01:10:14.920 --> 01:10:19.880]   A few months later, an Apple executive told her, "Jobs had all the designers return to
[01:10:19.880 --> 01:10:25.160]   the store after it opened and spend the night on their hands and knees cleaning the white
[01:10:25.160 --> 01:10:26.160]   surface."
[01:10:26.160 --> 01:10:31.760]   And of course, ever since Apple's stores have had stone tiles on the grad.
[01:10:31.760 --> 01:10:35.880]   There's some really good stories in here.
[01:10:35.880 --> 01:10:40.240]   Steve Jobs showing Mark Andries in a prototype of the iPhone 5.
[01:10:40.240 --> 01:10:44.920]   Andries says, "Boy, Steve, don't you think it's going to be a problem not having a physical
[01:10:44.920 --> 01:10:45.920]   keyboard?
[01:10:45.920 --> 01:10:49.360]   Are people really going to be okay typing directly on the screen?"
[01:10:49.360 --> 01:10:53.000]   He says, "Jobs looked me right in the eye with that piercing gaze and said, 'They'll
[01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:54.000]   get used to it.'"
[01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:59.280]   It just turned into swivel chair.
[01:10:59.280 --> 01:11:01.280]   "They'll get used to it."
[01:11:01.280 --> 01:11:02.280]   "They'll get used to it."
[01:11:02.280 --> 01:11:03.280]   "The bottom card's old."
[01:11:03.280 --> 01:11:04.960]   And that man was dead.
[01:11:04.960 --> 01:11:10.200]   Nolan Bushnell, Regis McKenna.
[01:11:10.200 --> 01:11:13.640]   Some of these stories actually I've heard before, but it's kind of great to hear him
[01:11:13.640 --> 01:11:15.640]   again.
[01:11:15.640 --> 01:11:21.640]   And if you even read the Isaac's in book, this would be a good time to do it one year
[01:11:21.640 --> 01:11:22.640]   later.
[01:11:22.640 --> 01:11:27.760]   But still, there's nothing like it in terms of understanding what was going on with Steve
[01:11:27.760 --> 01:11:33.360]   Jobs.
[01:11:33.360 --> 01:11:34.360]   I'll leave it at that.
[01:11:34.360 --> 01:11:36.800]   I don't want to read the whole all the anecdotes.
[01:11:36.800 --> 01:11:41.240]   Heidi Royzen is in here.
[01:11:41.240 --> 01:11:47.960]   Steve was really, really good one-on-one to interact with.
[01:11:47.960 --> 01:11:49.200]   You could have a conversation with him.
[01:11:49.200 --> 01:11:50.200]   He wasn't putting on a show.
[01:11:50.200 --> 01:11:52.920]   If there were more than two people in the room, the marketing in Steve came out.
[01:11:52.920 --> 01:11:54.880]   This is that hyperbole thing you were talking about.
[01:11:54.880 --> 01:11:58.640]   He then put on the show, says a CEO who worked with Jobs after his return to Apple in the
[01:11:58.640 --> 01:11:59.640]   90s.
[01:11:59.640 --> 01:12:00.880]   He was always polite.
[01:12:00.880 --> 01:12:03.040]   And he had to be nice because he needed something for me.
[01:12:03.040 --> 01:12:06.680]   There was a period of time when he came back to Apple when he needed people to work with
[01:12:06.680 --> 01:12:07.680]   him.
[01:12:07.680 --> 01:12:08.680]   Apple was a mess.
[01:12:08.680 --> 01:12:10.040]   Next was a failure.
[01:12:10.040 --> 01:12:13.720]   So he was somebody at that time in the early days when after of his return where you could
[01:12:13.720 --> 01:12:14.880]   work with him.
[01:12:14.880 --> 01:12:18.760]   But as he became more and more successful with the iPod than the iPhone, he became more
[01:12:18.760 --> 01:12:21.120]   and more arrogant, the old Steve.
[01:12:21.120 --> 01:12:28.240]   There were times, quote, where what he said he was going to do something and what he did
[01:12:28.240 --> 01:12:29.680]   were not necessarily consistent.
[01:12:29.680 --> 01:12:33.120]   And when I challenged him on that, he said, "Yeah, yeah, I know, but I needed to change
[01:12:33.120 --> 01:12:34.960]   my mind."
[01:12:34.960 --> 01:12:40.640]   It was okay in his mind to lie in service of Apple, in service of marketing.
[01:12:40.640 --> 01:12:44.680]   I think that's, I think we know that.
[01:12:44.680 --> 01:12:45.680]   Good article.
[01:12:45.680 --> 01:12:46.680]   Highly recommended.
[01:12:46.680 --> 01:12:53.240]   He was appropriate, I think, to think back a year to the passing of Steve Jobs.
[01:12:53.240 --> 01:12:54.240]   So young.
[01:12:54.240 --> 01:12:56.360]   And I say that because I'm about to turn 56.
[01:12:56.360 --> 01:12:57.640]   His age when he died.
[01:12:57.640 --> 01:13:00.880]   Speaking of dead, Ping's gone.
[01:13:00.880 --> 01:13:01.880]   Anybody miss it?
[01:13:01.880 --> 01:13:03.680]   What's Ping?
[01:13:03.680 --> 01:13:04.680]   Ping?
[01:13:04.680 --> 01:13:05.680]   No idea.
[01:13:05.680 --> 01:13:06.680]   September 30th it disappeared.
[01:13:06.680 --> 01:13:08.680]   And I don't think anybody knows.
[01:13:08.680 --> 01:13:09.680]   Tennis rackets?
[01:13:09.680 --> 01:13:10.680]   Ping.
[01:13:10.680 --> 01:13:11.680]   Ping.
[01:13:11.680 --> 01:13:12.680]   Golf ball.
[01:13:12.680 --> 01:13:13.680]   So they golf ball.
[01:13:13.680 --> 01:13:14.680]   Ping.
[01:13:14.680 --> 01:13:17.360]   You can use on the command line to check to see if we're connected.
[01:13:17.360 --> 01:13:18.360]   Yes, that's it.
[01:13:18.360 --> 01:13:19.360]   Ping a server.
[01:13:19.360 --> 01:13:20.360]   I use that thing all the time.
[01:13:20.360 --> 01:13:21.360]   I know, I need that.
[01:13:21.360 --> 01:13:23.560]   It had its fans.
[01:13:23.560 --> 01:13:29.120]   It's almost as if there was like a social circle of people who use that every day and
[01:13:29.120 --> 01:13:32.280]   they use it to connect to other devices and other things.
[01:13:32.280 --> 01:13:36.800]   And it just shows what happens when a top, a top rast does not have faith in a product.
[01:13:36.800 --> 01:13:39.840]   Given another 10 years, Ping might have had another 30 years.
[01:13:39.840 --> 01:13:42.800]   I know some people use Ping because everyone's about to get an email saying, "Do you really
[01:13:42.800 --> 01:13:45.000]   buy all that crap on iTunes?"
[01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:47.360]   Because I was...
[01:13:47.360 --> 01:13:51.880]   That's for the only times I've used Ping was being reminded that when someone asked you,
[01:13:51.880 --> 01:13:54.120]   you really bought the Jerry Lewis collection.
[01:13:54.120 --> 01:13:55.120]   That's a...
[01:13:55.120 --> 01:14:00.080]   Okay, first of all, they're novelty records, but they're big band novelty records.
[01:14:00.080 --> 01:14:02.360]   He has a version of "Rock-a-Buy My Baby."
[01:14:02.360 --> 01:14:04.960]   You get to hear him arguing with the band beforehand.
[01:14:04.960 --> 01:14:06.760]   Don't judge me.
[01:14:06.760 --> 01:14:08.160]   Don't judge me.
[01:14:08.160 --> 01:14:10.720]   Late last night, Samsung dropped the other shoe.
[01:14:10.720 --> 01:14:13.560]   They said they would sue if Apple shipped an LTE phone.
[01:14:13.560 --> 01:14:14.800]   They are.
[01:14:14.800 --> 01:14:22.800]   Samsung has gone back to Judge Lucy Coe, I think.
[01:14:22.800 --> 01:14:27.840]   Alleging patent infringement by the iPhone 5.
[01:14:27.840 --> 01:14:29.640]   I don't know if they're asking for an injunction.
[01:14:29.640 --> 01:14:34.680]   Wouldn't that be a turnabout if they said, "Hey, can you stop selling that?"
[01:14:34.680 --> 01:14:38.880]   Samsung, we have a little choice but to take the steps necessary to protect our innovations
[01:14:38.880 --> 01:14:40.080]   and intellectual property rights.
[01:14:40.080 --> 01:14:42.880]   I should have just read that and said, "Who said this?"
[01:14:42.880 --> 01:14:47.400]   Because it could have been Apple.
[01:14:47.400 --> 01:14:52.280]   Also the injunction against the Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1, which really isn't even the latest
[01:14:52.280 --> 01:14:58.640]   and greatest anymore, has been lifted because, of course, the jury had determined that the
[01:14:58.640 --> 01:15:01.800]   Galaxy Tab did not infringe.
[01:15:01.800 --> 01:15:08.840]   Judge Coe, who had issued a temporary restraining order, has lifted that injunction.
[01:15:08.840 --> 01:15:16.720]   The ban, which has been in place in the US since June, is no longer in place.
[01:15:16.720 --> 01:15:20.880]   Let the Galaxy Tab 10.1 success story begin.
[01:15:20.880 --> 01:15:29.400]   And a grateful populist breathed a sigh of relief and a scramble to the best buy.
[01:15:29.400 --> 01:15:32.280]   So there you go, back in court, Apple and Samsung.
[01:15:32.280 --> 01:15:33.280]   One more time.
[01:15:33.280 --> 01:15:34.280]   Let's do it again.
[01:15:34.280 --> 01:15:38.720]   It was so much fun last time.
[01:15:38.720 --> 01:15:39.720]   Sorry.
[01:15:39.720 --> 01:15:41.560]   No, I like it.
[01:15:41.560 --> 01:15:42.560]   Sound effects.
[01:15:42.560 --> 01:15:43.560]   Sound effects.
[01:15:43.560 --> 01:15:44.560]   It's good.
[01:15:44.560 --> 01:15:47.760]   You're like the Adam Curry of Gadget's blogs.
[01:15:47.760 --> 01:15:56.920]   Samsung's scheduled a strategy meeting with Eric Schmidt over the Android War.
[01:15:56.920 --> 01:15:58.960]   Eric Schmidt's going to South Korea.
[01:15:58.960 --> 01:16:02.640]   Mr. Schmidt goes to Pong Yang or whatever.
[01:16:02.640 --> 01:16:06.720]   Samsung's mobile chief has revealed in what's been tipped to be an attempt to boost Google's
[01:16:06.720 --> 01:16:08.600]   involvement in Android litigation.
[01:16:08.600 --> 01:16:16.880]   They'd love to have Google and it's a cadre of lawyers marching into court with them.
[01:16:16.880 --> 01:16:19.440]   Google has made no comment on this.
[01:16:19.440 --> 01:16:22.720]   You've got to think that Google's paying close attention though.
[01:16:22.720 --> 01:16:29.040]   They're just waiting for the Apple's steely gaze to shift to Mountain View.
[01:16:29.040 --> 01:16:31.560]   I don't think they can afford to have the flag.
[01:16:31.560 --> 01:16:35.240]   The best Android phones continually targeted for legal action.
[01:16:35.240 --> 01:16:36.240]   Right.
[01:16:36.240 --> 01:16:39.800]   Because the 2012 is, people are sick of me hearing this, but I'll say it again.
[01:16:39.800 --> 01:16:44.520]   So anyway, 2012 is a year in which the really great Android phones started coming out.
[01:16:44.520 --> 01:16:52.160]   If there was a successful injunction against the Galaxy 3 or the HTC One or last year's
[01:16:52.160 --> 01:16:56.840]   Galaxy Nexus phone, that would have deprived Android of Google.
[01:16:56.840 --> 01:17:01.720]   At least there are three best case studies of here is really well designed hardware running
[01:17:01.720 --> 01:17:05.160]   the latest software that proves here's what we're trying to do with Android.
[01:17:05.160 --> 01:17:06.880]   Here's why it's actually an attractive alternative.
[01:17:06.880 --> 01:17:11.600]   They'll still be stuck with the problem of most Android phones being still running 2.2
[01:17:11.600 --> 01:17:14.040]   or even over 3.1.
[01:17:14.040 --> 01:17:17.680]   But they really need to maintain that high ground somewhere.
[01:17:17.680 --> 01:17:22.400]   And so it's kind of like we're talking about this in the pre-show that when we're talking
[01:17:22.400 --> 01:17:28.200]   about the design of Android's back button and things like that, I think that the history
[01:17:28.200 --> 01:17:34.600]   of Android has demonstrated how poor a model, this idea of freedom and openness and everybody
[01:17:34.600 --> 01:17:39.600]   do exactly what they want can be if you're trying to make any sort of a creative or commercial
[01:17:39.600 --> 01:17:42.120]   impact with the real world.
[01:17:42.120 --> 01:17:45.200]   At some point you need to get the heads of the five families together and we got to
[01:17:45.200 --> 01:17:48.080]   agree that we're either going to go into the drug business or we're not going to go into
[01:17:48.080 --> 01:17:49.080]   the drug business.
[01:17:49.080 --> 01:17:52.640]   What we're not going to do is I'll be fighting each other about what we want to do next.
[01:17:52.640 --> 01:17:57.360]   It's tricky though because if it's true that Google makes more money on the iPhone, I
[01:17:57.360 --> 01:18:00.880]   mean, Google really isn't in the handset business.
[01:18:00.880 --> 01:18:01.960]   Motorola notwithstanding.
[01:18:01.960 --> 01:18:06.000]   In fact, didn't Motorola withdraw its lawsuit this week?
[01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:08.000]   I think I read that.
[01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:10.240]   Google's got to balance all this stuff, right?
[01:18:10.240 --> 01:18:11.240]   It's like Samsung.
[01:18:11.240 --> 01:18:15.040]   They're doing business with Apple at the same time as they're suing Apple.
[01:18:15.040 --> 01:18:17.520]   It's tricky.
[01:18:17.520 --> 01:18:25.240]   Amazon has asked federal court to throw out Apple's false advertising, claiming in a lawsuit
[01:18:25.240 --> 01:18:34.000]   that, oh no, this is Apple's false advertising claim in a lawsuit over the App Store name.
[01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:41.760]   Remember, Apple sued saying you can't call it an App Store in a filing Wednesday.
[01:18:41.760 --> 01:18:47.440]   Amazon said the term App Store is so generic using it could not constitute false advertising.
[01:18:47.440 --> 01:18:52.560]   The issue was that Amazon by using the words App Store was somehow implying it was the
[01:18:52.560 --> 01:18:53.560]   Apple App Store.
[01:18:53.560 --> 01:18:54.560]   Of course, it's not.
[01:18:54.560 --> 01:18:56.560]   It's not App Store.
[01:18:56.560 --> 01:18:59.280]   It's got ridiculous plans, isn't it?
[01:18:59.280 --> 01:19:03.400]   Yeah, and Amazon did change the name to Amazon App Store for Android.
[01:19:03.400 --> 01:19:11.240]   It's a streamlined and elegant as Android itself.
[01:19:11.240 --> 01:19:12.240]   Yeah.
[01:19:12.240 --> 01:19:15.280]   Or as Amazon's fork of Android.
[01:19:15.280 --> 01:19:16.280]   Right.
[01:19:16.280 --> 01:19:22.000]   Which is, I like the cut off the stuff that you don't need if you're not going to be
[01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:23.200]   re-bearing to fucking movies.
[01:19:23.200 --> 01:19:24.200]   It's very basic.
[01:19:24.200 --> 01:19:25.200]   That's okay.
[01:19:25.200 --> 01:19:28.760]   I'm going to actually review that before you buy later this afternoon.
[01:19:28.760 --> 01:19:35.480]   I like it, but with the Nexus 7, at the same price point out there, most of our audience
[01:19:35.480 --> 01:19:39.360]   anyway would be more interested in Nexus 7 or perhaps a 7.85 inch iPad.
[01:19:39.360 --> 01:19:41.360]   I don't know.
[01:19:41.360 --> 01:19:43.560]   Again, it's a price.
[01:19:43.560 --> 01:19:46.440]   I still like the fire a lot.
[01:19:46.440 --> 01:19:48.360]   It's the FireHD, the new fire.
[01:19:48.360 --> 01:19:49.360]   The FireHD.
[01:19:49.360 --> 01:19:51.360]   Are you talking about the paperweight or the FireHD?
[01:19:51.360 --> 01:19:52.360]   No.
[01:19:52.360 --> 01:19:53.360]   The FireHD is the one thing.
[01:19:53.360 --> 01:19:54.360]   Yeah.
[01:19:54.360 --> 01:19:55.360]   I like it.
[01:19:55.360 --> 01:19:56.360]   No, I like it.
[01:19:56.360 --> 01:19:58.800]   At least it's, as long as that hesitation.
[01:19:58.800 --> 01:20:03.000]   Actually, you know, I don't have the fire on me, but I did get the paperweight today.
[01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:06.000]   Oh, oh, oh, let's see it.
[01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:07.000]   Oh, yeah.
[01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:08.400]   I'm glad I had it handy.
[01:20:08.400 --> 01:20:09.960]   I figured that somebody might want to see it at some time.
[01:20:09.960 --> 01:20:11.640]   Do we have a paper white house?
[01:20:11.640 --> 01:20:12.640]   Is it paper white?
[01:20:12.640 --> 01:20:13.640]   Yeah.
[01:20:13.640 --> 01:20:14.640]   Paperweight.
[01:20:14.640 --> 01:20:15.640]   Yes.
[01:20:15.640 --> 01:20:16.640]   The paperweight.
[01:20:16.640 --> 01:20:17.640]   I've had it for a couple of weeks.
[01:20:17.640 --> 01:20:19.920]   It's the backlighting doesn't illuminate the page.
[01:20:19.920 --> 01:20:24.200]   It just simply increases the contrast between the ink and the background.
[01:20:24.200 --> 01:20:28.200]   The brain really does believe that, oh, I'm actually looking at a nicely printed page.
[01:20:28.200 --> 01:20:29.200]   Oh, that's good.
[01:20:29.200 --> 01:20:30.200]   Yeah.
[01:20:30.200 --> 01:20:31.200]   That's what you want.
[01:20:31.200 --> 01:20:32.200]   Recommended then.
[01:20:32.200 --> 01:20:36.080]   We're going to be announcing our score and recommendation status for it.
[01:20:36.080 --> 01:20:38.840]   I think either later today or tomorrow.
[01:20:38.840 --> 01:20:43.800]   Brian, I'll send you a link to my review, which ran on Sunday night.
[01:20:43.800 --> 01:20:45.840]   And we might already have it up.
[01:20:45.840 --> 01:20:46.840]   And what you think, Andy?
[01:20:46.840 --> 01:20:47.840]   What'd you think?
[01:20:47.840 --> 01:20:48.840]   Very, very highly.
[01:20:48.840 --> 01:20:54.280]   But I think I'm a big fan of the Kindle ecosystem above all the other bookstore ecosystems.
[01:20:54.280 --> 01:21:01.000]   But this is a great example of how good a device you can build for 120 bucks.
[01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:05.040]   And the challenges that any tablet maker, including someone who's designing something
[01:21:05.040 --> 01:21:10.280]   like the Kindle Fire has and is competing with an E-ink, a really well designed E-ink
[01:21:10.280 --> 01:21:11.280]   based reader.
[01:21:11.280 --> 01:21:13.840]   Because they're people who just want these devices to read books.
[01:21:13.840 --> 01:21:14.960]   They don't want to spend a lot of money.
[01:21:14.960 --> 01:21:19.680]   They want this to have every advantage of a traditional book and none of the disadvantages
[01:21:19.680 --> 01:21:21.360]   of a colored glossy screen.
[01:21:21.360 --> 01:21:23.360]   So great stuff.
[01:21:23.360 --> 01:21:24.800]   The ads get annoying after a while.
[01:21:24.800 --> 01:21:27.120]   So you'll want to spend that extra 20 bucks.
[01:21:27.120 --> 01:21:28.120]   Really?
[01:21:28.120 --> 01:21:32.040]   Well, I mean, it's just how many times do you want to see an ad for Titanic when you open
[01:21:32.040 --> 01:21:33.680]   this open up your book?
[01:21:33.680 --> 01:21:35.720]   And for a lot of...
[01:21:35.720 --> 01:21:41.200]   I appreciate what Amazon is doing in seeing that here is how much it will cost for us
[01:21:41.200 --> 01:21:42.920]   to sell this at a profit.
[01:21:42.920 --> 01:21:45.080]   But that's still going to be too expensive for some people.
[01:21:45.080 --> 01:21:49.400]   So we're going to give people the option of having a cheaper product that has ads on
[01:21:49.400 --> 01:21:50.400]   it.
[01:21:50.400 --> 01:21:51.720]   If they don't want it, they can spend 20 bucks more.
[01:21:51.720 --> 01:21:55.800]   But if 20 bucks is that big of a problem for them, we'll aggressively help them to spend
[01:21:55.800 --> 01:21:59.120]   as little as they can possibly spend for our product.
[01:21:59.120 --> 01:22:02.640]   And I think for most people, the 20 bucks is not going to be a big deal.
[01:22:02.640 --> 01:22:05.240]   But it gets a little bit old after.
[01:22:05.240 --> 01:22:06.600]   It got old for me after a while.
[01:22:06.600 --> 01:22:09.400]   Especially because there are a lot of bunch of movies I saw this year that I didn't really
[01:22:09.400 --> 01:22:10.400]   like being reminded.
[01:22:10.400 --> 01:22:16.800]   Now that they're all being released on Blu-ray, they're like, "Man, I don't read books anymore.
[01:22:16.800 --> 01:22:17.960]   I don't read books anymore.
[01:22:17.960 --> 01:22:20.320]   Listen, does it support audio?"
[01:22:20.320 --> 01:22:21.320]   Yes.
[01:22:21.320 --> 01:22:22.560]   Oh, I'm sorry.
[01:22:22.560 --> 01:22:26.920]   The new fire doesn't have audio at it, I don't believe.
[01:22:26.920 --> 01:22:28.240]   But the paper white, does that support it?
[01:22:28.240 --> 01:22:29.640]   The paper white doesn't, as far as I know.
[01:22:29.640 --> 01:22:30.640]   The fire HD does.
[01:22:30.640 --> 01:22:34.740]   Actually, that's one of the neat things on the fire HD is you put your audio, audible
[01:22:34.740 --> 01:22:41.980]   books on there, if you have the matching Kindle book, you open the Kindle book and you can
[01:22:41.980 --> 01:22:45.380]   press play and listen and read at the same time, or it'll do whispers sync so you can
[01:22:45.380 --> 01:22:48.340]   leave off reading and start listening or vice versa.
[01:22:48.340 --> 01:22:49.340]   I'm really like that feature.
[01:22:49.340 --> 01:22:50.580]   So that's not on the paper white.
[01:22:50.580 --> 01:22:51.580]   I'm sticking with the Kindle.
[01:22:51.580 --> 01:22:52.580]   I'm sorry.
[01:22:52.580 --> 01:22:57.580]   You don't get audio out on the paper white, but whispers sync of audio will work across
[01:22:57.580 --> 01:22:59.260]   the iPhone app for us.
[01:22:59.260 --> 01:23:00.260]   Okay.
[01:23:00.260 --> 01:23:01.260]   That's not bad.
[01:23:01.260 --> 01:23:02.260]   Yeah.
[01:23:02.260 --> 01:23:04.660]   And are they really getting eight hours battery life?
[01:23:04.660 --> 01:23:06.140]   I mean, eight weeks?
[01:23:06.140 --> 01:23:07.700]   Oh, yeah.
[01:23:07.700 --> 01:23:10.060]   It's hard to test a battery that lasts that long.
[01:23:10.060 --> 01:23:14.980]   Seriously, I mean, I had it for about a week before the embargo lifted.
[01:23:14.980 --> 01:23:20.980]   And in that time, it went from fully charged to something like two thirds battery left.
[01:23:20.980 --> 01:23:24.260]   And that's with the backlight on all the time, too.
[01:23:24.260 --> 01:23:28.520]   So that's, it's still, we get back to the reasons why a lot of people will gravitate
[01:23:28.520 --> 01:23:33.520]   naturally towards an eink reader instead of even a $200 iPad because the $200 iPad is
[01:23:33.520 --> 01:23:34.520]   dead after two days.
[01:23:34.520 --> 01:23:37.040]   We don't remember to plug it back in.
[01:23:37.040 --> 01:23:38.040]   All right.
[01:23:38.040 --> 01:23:39.080]   Well, there you go.
[01:23:39.080 --> 01:23:43.940]   It's a little bit off of subject, but I still, I think of interest.
[01:23:43.940 --> 01:23:45.360]   The Kindle paper white.
[01:23:45.360 --> 01:23:52.080]   You can buy Kindle books in the Safari browser on your Mac, then have it sync to the device
[01:23:52.080 --> 01:23:55.960]   holds, which kind of fits right in there.
[01:23:55.960 --> 01:24:01.360]   That's right in there.
[01:24:01.360 --> 01:24:02.440]   Freedom pop.
[01:24:02.440 --> 01:24:03.440]   You guys know anything about this?
[01:24:03.440 --> 01:24:05.600]   This is, I got a question about it over the weekend.
[01:24:05.600 --> 01:24:06.600]   And that's kind of intriguing.
[01:24:06.600 --> 01:24:11.520]   Nicholas Zensdrum who founded Skype has been talking about this for a year, but it's finally
[01:24:11.520 --> 01:24:12.520]   starting to ship.
[01:24:12.520 --> 01:24:21.400]   It is free Y-Max in the areas that you still can get Y-Max, free meaning 500 megabytes a
[01:24:21.400 --> 01:24:23.400]   month.
[01:24:23.400 --> 01:24:29.480]   Apparently, they plan to switch to Sprint's LTE spectrum next year.
[01:24:29.480 --> 01:24:38.400]   And they offer $100 back for iPod touches and iPhones that will add this capability to
[01:24:38.400 --> 01:24:39.400]   it.
[01:24:39.400 --> 01:24:42.120]   They have a $99 iPhone and iPod case that doubles as a hotspot.
[01:24:42.120 --> 01:24:45.400]   That's not out for four to six weeks.
[01:24:45.400 --> 01:24:50.160]   Past 500 megabytes, 10 bucks for every gigabyte, which is basically what the regular carriers
[01:24:50.160 --> 01:24:52.080]   are paying.
[01:24:52.080 --> 01:24:55.680]   And they hope to recoup the cost of the free data by selling premium services.
[01:24:55.680 --> 01:24:59.120]   This is essentially a freemium model.
[01:24:59.120 --> 01:25:00.120]   So the $99 add-on.
[01:25:00.120 --> 01:25:02.880]   Anybody, Ryan, have you heard anything about this?
[01:25:02.880 --> 01:25:04.680]   Have you heard anybody using it?
[01:25:04.680 --> 01:25:05.680]   Just start.
[01:25:05.680 --> 01:25:06.680]   I've heard of a couple of people using it.
[01:25:06.680 --> 01:25:09.920]   I haven't really heard very much about if it's any good.
[01:25:09.920 --> 01:25:14.240]   I mean, being Y-Max, it's going to have a very limited shelf life.
[01:25:14.240 --> 01:25:16.800]   So that's switched LTE's got to come sooner than later.
[01:25:16.800 --> 01:25:23.200]   And even then, it's not really out very many places.
[01:25:23.200 --> 01:25:26.360]   I'm a little skeptical about products like this.
[01:25:26.360 --> 01:25:27.360]   Sometimes they come along.
[01:25:27.360 --> 01:25:34.280]   You know, Zenstrom has had a number of things over the years that have kind of questioned
[01:25:34.280 --> 01:25:40.800]   or called users to question the status quo of how things work with television.
[01:25:40.800 --> 01:25:41.800]   Sky.
[01:25:41.800 --> 01:25:42.800]   Yeah, the TV thing is--
[01:25:42.800 --> 01:25:43.800]   Yeah, the TV thing is--
[01:25:43.800 --> 01:25:44.800]   I can't remember what the TV was.
[01:25:44.800 --> 01:25:47.320]   [MUMBLING]
[01:25:47.320 --> 01:25:48.320]   What was it?
[01:25:48.320 --> 01:25:49.320]   What was the thing?
[01:25:49.320 --> 01:25:50.320]   It was instead now, right?
[01:25:50.320 --> 01:25:51.320]   Yeah.
[01:25:51.320 --> 01:25:52.320]   Juice.
[01:25:52.320 --> 01:25:53.320]   Juice.
[01:25:53.320 --> 01:25:54.320]   Thank you, Moki.
[01:25:54.320 --> 01:25:55.320]   Juice.
[01:25:55.320 --> 01:25:56.560]   Chatroom, you're awesome.
[01:25:56.560 --> 01:26:00.160]   But you know, those things have not really kind of panned out.
[01:26:00.160 --> 01:26:02.640]   Generally speaking, they're a little too high concept.
[01:26:02.640 --> 01:26:06.520]   I think this is just one of those things where most people are probably not going to benefit
[01:26:06.520 --> 01:26:11.280]   enough from it to go through the process instead of just dealing directly with their
[01:26:11.280 --> 01:26:12.280]   carrier.
[01:26:12.280 --> 01:26:13.280]   Yeah.
[01:26:13.280 --> 01:26:15.640]   Well, anyway, I think it's worth a mention.
[01:26:15.640 --> 01:26:17.560]   I'm skeptical too until I see it.
[01:26:17.560 --> 01:26:19.640]   But I wouldn't buy the $100 back.
[01:26:19.640 --> 01:26:20.640]   Let's put it that way.
[01:26:20.640 --> 01:26:22.360]   I'd try it before you do that.
[01:26:22.360 --> 01:26:27.200]   I mean, do we know if they're like-- because you're funneling traffic through that network,
[01:26:27.200 --> 01:26:31.360]   do we know if they're doing analysis and if part of their play is they're going to make
[01:26:31.360 --> 01:26:34.120]   up any by selling your data?
[01:26:34.120 --> 01:26:39.200]   I mean, that's the kind of thing that those guys wouldn't chalk me if they were doing that,
[01:26:39.200 --> 01:26:41.520]   especially if their business model is to give something way free.
[01:26:41.520 --> 01:26:43.960]   You know, you got to make that money back somehow.
[01:26:43.960 --> 01:26:47.920]   We collect information, including personal information, when you use our services.
[01:26:47.920 --> 01:26:54.280]   We-- I'm reading the privacy policy.
[01:26:54.280 --> 01:26:59.520]   It looks pretty normal.
[01:26:59.520 --> 01:27:02.640]   We connect information about your usage and activity on our services.
[01:27:02.640 --> 01:27:06.200]   We and service providers acting on our behalf, like Google Analytics, use this information
[01:27:06.200 --> 01:27:07.920]   to understand and analyze trends.
[01:27:07.920 --> 01:27:11.920]   Combine this with other information.
[01:27:11.920 --> 01:27:12.920]   This looks--
[01:27:12.920 --> 01:27:16.360]   I mean, that's kind of boilerplate that everybody has in their privacy policy.
[01:27:16.360 --> 01:27:18.960]   It doesn't really tell you what they're actually doing.
[01:27:18.960 --> 01:27:22.600]   We use your information to offer you our products and services as well as third-party
[01:27:22.600 --> 01:27:28.480]   products and services that may be of interest to you.
[01:27:28.480 --> 01:27:33.400]   To administer contests and promotions to send you emails about products and services.
[01:27:33.400 --> 01:27:34.400]   Yeah.
[01:27:34.400 --> 01:27:35.400]   I have a feeling this is--
[01:27:35.400 --> 01:27:37.960]   And at the end of the day, nothing's really free.
[01:27:37.960 --> 01:27:38.960]   Right.
[01:27:38.960 --> 01:27:44.040]   So you just have to make the calculated judgment as to which supposedly free products are going
[01:27:44.040 --> 01:27:50.440]   to exploit you and which are going to exploit you, I guess, less.
[01:27:50.440 --> 01:27:56.880]   It's stuff like this where it gets into things that we know of as being extremely high costs.
[01:27:56.880 --> 01:28:00.480]   So broadband wireless network access.
[01:28:00.480 --> 01:28:02.560]   That is something that costs a lot of money.
[01:28:02.560 --> 01:28:05.600]   It's not like email over the web that is very cheap.
[01:28:05.600 --> 01:28:06.600]   Right.
[01:28:06.600 --> 01:28:08.800]   And it looks like they're putting ads on there too.
[01:28:08.800 --> 01:28:11.440]   So yeah, probably not worth it.
[01:28:11.440 --> 01:28:19.840]   It makes me think about the fact that so many people use iPhone cases as a substitute
[01:28:19.840 --> 01:28:21.560]   for an expansion bus.
[01:28:21.560 --> 01:28:25.920]   So you have to choose between-- you can have this iPhone case that gives you YMAX.
[01:28:25.920 --> 01:28:28.360]   But if you do that, you'll have to take off your iPhone case.
[01:28:28.360 --> 01:28:30.080]   It gives you wireless charging.
[01:28:30.080 --> 01:28:33.480]   And of course, if you use the wireless charging case, you can't use the wonderful Mophie Juice
[01:28:33.480 --> 01:28:35.360]   pack, which gives you three times the battery life.
[01:28:35.360 --> 01:28:38.680]   Unless you wanted the NFC battery case, in which case--
[01:28:38.680 --> 01:28:39.680]   Oh, dear.
[01:28:39.680 --> 01:28:42.240]   When is Mophie going to put an iPhone 5 case?
[01:28:42.240 --> 01:28:45.200]   Anybody heard from anything from them?
[01:28:45.200 --> 01:28:49.360]   I have not heard the good cases are finally starting to trickle in.
[01:28:49.360 --> 01:28:57.200]   I tested out the new iPhone 5 version of the Otterbox 10 days past Armageddon style case.
[01:28:57.200 --> 01:28:59.480]   And it really does--
[01:28:59.480 --> 01:29:05.600]   You can just feel the teardrops from Johnny I's sad, sad face drop into the ground.
[01:29:05.600 --> 01:29:10.880]   This beautiful thing encased into this huge brick of plastic.
[01:29:10.880 --> 01:29:14.800]   It protects it like no one's business, but oh, man, this was not part of the plan when
[01:29:14.800 --> 01:29:16.800]   they designed this beautiful phone.
[01:29:16.800 --> 01:29:17.880]   I know how you feel.
[01:29:17.880 --> 01:29:21.160]   And yet, I rarely see an iPhone without a case.
[01:29:21.160 --> 01:29:22.160]   Exactly.
[01:29:22.160 --> 01:29:25.960]   That's coming in part three of the review.
[01:29:25.960 --> 01:29:30.360]   You can't talk about a new iPhone without talking about how just gobsmackingly beautiful
[01:29:30.360 --> 01:29:31.360]   it is.
[01:29:31.360 --> 01:29:36.680]   But then you also have-- I had to sort of slap myself in the face this year and start noticing
[01:29:36.680 --> 01:29:40.600]   every time you see someone with an iPhone, do they have it naked or do they have it in
[01:29:40.600 --> 01:29:41.840]   a case?
[01:29:41.840 --> 01:29:46.600]   And it's rare that I see someone using an iPhone without some sort of a cheap rubber
[01:29:46.600 --> 01:29:48.400]   plastic case around it.
[01:29:48.400 --> 01:29:49.400]   Yeah.
[01:29:49.400 --> 01:29:52.360]   Well, you know, the more beautiful the phone gets, the more you want to protect its beauty.
[01:29:52.360 --> 01:29:53.360]   Yeah.
[01:29:53.360 --> 01:29:54.960]   So then you go to even greater lengths.
[01:29:54.960 --> 01:29:58.400]   It's where a more elaborate protective cases.
[01:29:58.400 --> 01:29:59.400]   Yeah.
[01:29:59.400 --> 01:30:00.400]   Consumers are weird.
[01:30:00.400 --> 01:30:02.760]   And not only is it a case of one who protected.
[01:30:02.760 --> 01:30:09.680]   I like this grippy speck case over my 4S chiefly because that way that it doesn't slide
[01:30:09.680 --> 01:30:13.280]   off of-- it doesn't slide out of my pocket, it doesn't slide off of tables.
[01:30:13.280 --> 01:30:16.440]   And also it's easier to hold on to when I'm using it as a camera.
[01:30:16.440 --> 01:30:20.960]   But part of it is that I just want my iPhone to look like my iPhone and not like a million
[01:30:20.960 --> 01:30:22.040]   others of them.
[01:30:22.040 --> 01:30:28.120]   So I would not want the job of trying to design a compelling product that consumers are going
[01:30:28.120 --> 01:30:34.120]   to respond to because all your best efforts are going to be hamstrung at the very end
[01:30:34.120 --> 01:30:37.680]   by consumers simply is a big fan of Hello Kitty.
[01:30:37.680 --> 01:30:38.680]   Sorry.
[01:30:38.680 --> 01:30:43.360]   You're two years from the design experience is secondary to the desire to have a Hello Kitty
[01:30:43.360 --> 01:30:44.360]   iPhone case.
[01:30:44.360 --> 01:30:48.120]   On the other hand, the battery life on this is good enough that I don't feel so much
[01:30:48.120 --> 01:30:49.120]   the need for the Mofi.
[01:30:49.120 --> 01:30:52.080]   I was easily getting through the day even using a lot of LTE.
[01:30:52.080 --> 01:30:54.480]   They really did improve the battery life on that.
[01:30:54.480 --> 01:30:55.480]   That is awesome.
[01:30:55.480 --> 01:31:00.440]   I mean, that's one thing that Android can't really compete with right now.
[01:31:00.440 --> 01:31:04.800]   I think Apple does-- I think it's iOS that does a much better job of battery management
[01:31:04.800 --> 01:31:07.600]   than anything I've seen on Android beforehand.
[01:31:07.600 --> 01:31:11.920]   I almost never have a problem with running out of a juice on an iPhone, or else on Android.
[01:31:11.920 --> 01:31:16.560]   Even the best ones, I have to sort of be aware of what I want to do during the day.
[01:31:16.560 --> 01:31:19.600]   When you make the hardware and the software, you can do that.
[01:31:19.600 --> 01:31:22.960]   I think you can extend the battery life on Android devices further.
[01:31:22.960 --> 01:31:25.320]   You just have to really take that in your own hands.
[01:31:25.320 --> 01:31:29.720]   You have to constantly managing which apps are using too much power, which services
[01:31:29.720 --> 01:31:31.720]   should be shut on and off.
[01:31:31.720 --> 01:31:35.560]   It's a really high touch process in order to be able to maximize the battery life on
[01:31:35.560 --> 01:31:36.800]   your device.
[01:31:36.800 --> 01:31:42.200]   If you're willing to do that, and a lot of Android users are, you know, Mazeltov, but
[01:31:42.200 --> 01:31:45.360]   I think the rest of us don't want to spend half of our time on our phone managing our
[01:31:45.360 --> 01:31:46.360]   phone.
[01:31:46.360 --> 01:31:50.400]   Maybe you'd publish your picture review, your camera review on the iPhone 5.
[01:31:50.400 --> 01:31:52.000]   You want to summarize for us?
[01:31:52.000 --> 01:31:53.000]   It was fun last week.
[01:31:53.000 --> 01:31:54.000]   We had what was it?
[01:31:54.000 --> 01:32:00.160]   Five images, one taken with a micro four thirds camera, one with the iPhone 5 for S.
[01:32:00.160 --> 01:32:02.560]   Did you have some other cameras in there too?
[01:32:02.560 --> 01:32:05.080]   Actually, that was the full Menagerie.
[01:32:05.080 --> 01:32:07.560]   I did one that went all the way back to the 3GS.
[01:32:07.560 --> 01:32:13.800]   That was a self-portrait series, but other than that, I didn't expand it beyond that.
[01:32:13.800 --> 01:32:21.240]   But as a camera, I don't find it to be as big a leap forward from the 4S as the 4S was
[01:32:21.240 --> 01:32:22.240]   from the 4.
[01:32:22.240 --> 01:32:26.880]   That's only because the 4S was just such a huge leap forward to begin with.
[01:32:26.880 --> 01:32:32.880]   And you do see a lot of improvements in picture quality, but they're not dramatic ones.
[01:32:32.880 --> 01:32:39.000]   If you put these pictures side by side, again, same shot, same scene, same time of day, and
[01:32:39.000 --> 01:32:42.760]   you just take picture with one, take a picture with the other and put them side by side,
[01:32:42.760 --> 01:32:48.640]   you will after scrutiny decide that the iPhone 5 photo was better than the 4S, but it's not
[01:32:48.640 --> 01:32:53.560]   the sort of thing where it's not as big as it doesn't really smack you in the face how
[01:32:53.560 --> 01:32:54.920]   good the improvement is.
[01:32:54.920 --> 01:32:59.480]   And also, I was surprised with in good lighting and I have to underscore that, in good lighting,
[01:32:59.480 --> 01:33:02.280]   the Samsung Galaxy 3 was just as good as the iPhone 5.
[01:33:02.280 --> 01:33:07.520]   It's only in dimmer lighting when the Samsung just goes right off of a cliff there.
[01:33:07.520 --> 01:33:14.760]   The ultra low light has a special, and here's the biggest surprise from my testing.
[01:33:14.760 --> 01:33:21.080]   It has a special ultra low light mode where the ISP chip will decide that if you really
[01:33:21.080 --> 01:33:26.440]   aren't a desperately short of light situation, it will go into a mode where it will sort of
[01:33:26.440 --> 01:33:33.600]   sample 4 adjacent pixels to get light information and sort of sacrifice image resolution for
[01:33:33.600 --> 01:33:35.600]   image sensitivity.
[01:33:35.600 --> 01:33:40.720]   And the result is, I think I actually have one of these pictures here, the result is a shot
[01:33:40.720 --> 01:33:46.000]   that, I guess I don't have it here, but it's online, it's online if you want to check it
[01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:47.000]   out.
[01:33:47.000 --> 01:33:55.120]   It's a shot where this same setup in practically no light, it's a side by side by side comparison
[01:33:55.120 --> 01:33:59.640]   where here is a black rectangle that represents the photo that the 4S took, here's a black
[01:33:59.640 --> 01:34:04.360]   rectangle that represents what the Galaxy S3 took, and here is an actual photo that was
[01:34:04.360 --> 01:34:07.200]   taken by the iPhone 5, it works great.
[01:34:07.200 --> 01:34:10.920]   But there's a problem, and this is one of the reasons why I thought that this was, here's
[01:34:10.920 --> 01:34:17.640]   the photo from the iPhone 5, and as bad as this photo looks, that's actually quite accurate
[01:34:17.640 --> 01:34:18.640]   to what it was.
[01:34:18.640 --> 01:34:24.440]   I put these statues on the top of the dryer in the laundry room, had no lights on in the
[01:34:24.440 --> 01:34:29.240]   room, the door to the laundry room was left open, and that was the only source of lighting.
[01:34:29.240 --> 01:34:33.600]   So it's incredible that it got a photo as accurate as this out of that.
[01:34:33.600 --> 01:34:39.080]   But here's the reason why I had to actually delay this a little bit.
[01:34:39.080 --> 01:34:43.560]   I was having a consistent problem getting sharp photos from the iPhone 5 in a lot of
[01:34:43.560 --> 01:34:51.280]   situations where I don't have a real MIT IEEE test protocol.
[01:34:51.280 --> 01:34:55.480]   I have standard locations that I've been testing cameras with and photos and phones
[01:34:55.480 --> 01:34:59.800]   with for the first several years now, where the basic protocol is I compose the picture
[01:34:59.800 --> 01:35:05.600]   according to mathematical standards where I literally stand on the same tile in the library,
[01:35:05.600 --> 01:35:09.240]   put the crosshairs in the center of the image on this portrait that's on the far side of
[01:35:09.240 --> 01:35:14.800]   the hall, and then I take two or three pictures for safety just in case one comes up blurry.
[01:35:14.800 --> 01:35:20.680]   Time and time again, not all the time, but far more often than what I'm used to, the iPhone
[01:35:20.680 --> 01:35:24.480]   5 was not able to create a sharp image from that.
[01:35:24.480 --> 01:35:29.640]   Whereas the 4S was fine, the 4 was fine, and the Samsung were absolutely fine, but the
[01:35:29.640 --> 01:35:32.480]   iPhone 5 kept creasing blurry pictures.
[01:35:32.480 --> 01:35:34.360]   The last test I did.
[01:35:34.360 --> 01:35:37.600]   Andy, is that with HDR turned on?
[01:35:37.600 --> 01:35:38.600]   No.
[01:35:38.600 --> 01:35:39.880]   Here's an example.
[01:35:39.880 --> 01:35:43.440]   This is an iPhone 4S and an iPhone 5 in the Torx screwdriver.
[01:35:43.440 --> 01:35:44.440]   Right.
[01:35:44.440 --> 01:35:48.120]   Now, and this is the last test that I shot.
[01:35:48.120 --> 01:35:50.720]   What I finally can't, I don't know exactly what the problem was.
[01:35:50.720 --> 01:35:54.600]   Initially, I thought that maybe it was that this phone is so slim that I'm just not holding
[01:35:54.600 --> 01:35:57.280]   it very steadily because I'm careful about dropping it.
[01:35:57.280 --> 01:36:01.760]   But after it was put in that, that our box case, now it's as thick as can be that remove
[01:36:01.760 --> 01:36:02.920]   that variable.
[01:36:02.920 --> 01:36:07.640]   What I think is happening, and that's based on the context of these photos and also the
[01:36:07.640 --> 01:36:12.640]   XF information, I believe that there are certain, every time it's screwed up like this, it was
[01:36:12.640 --> 01:36:16.160]   in a low light, but not a desperately low light situation.
[01:36:16.160 --> 01:36:21.960]   I think what's happening is that the iPhone 5 is going into desperation mode and it's
[01:36:21.960 --> 01:36:26.560]   engaging that special, I'm going to just sample four pixels into one because the lighting
[01:36:26.560 --> 01:36:28.480]   is so bad.
[01:36:28.480 --> 01:36:31.760]   And whereas the other three phones were saying, well geez, the lighting is pretty bad, but
[01:36:31.760 --> 01:36:34.200]   I don't have to do anything desperate to make this work.
[01:36:34.200 --> 01:36:38.400]   And I believe it's not so much that it's out of focus, so much as it's lower in resolution
[01:36:38.400 --> 01:36:41.280]   because it engaged this special mode.
[01:36:41.280 --> 01:36:46.960]   So if you go on to, if you check the review on the Sun Toms, you'll see examples of this.
[01:36:46.960 --> 01:36:51.840]   There's also, I've also posted some of these pictures up on my Flickr feed.
[01:36:51.840 --> 01:36:56.560]   So if you want to take a look at them side by side, they're on the left, you see the iPhone
[01:36:56.560 --> 01:36:59.440]   5 version on the right, you see the iPhone 4S version.
[01:36:59.440 --> 01:37:03.360]   And it's just absolutely obvious that something wrong is going on with the iPhone 5.
[01:37:03.360 --> 01:37:08.880]   I should point out that in that particular series, I took three shots in a row, blurry,
[01:37:08.880 --> 01:37:09.880]   blurry, blurry.
[01:37:09.880 --> 01:37:12.000]   It's not as though there was that kind of a variable.
[01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:17.160]   So I think that's what's happening in that I never, it's not as though it was blurring
[01:37:17.160 --> 01:37:20.160]   pictures in when there was greater amounts of light.
[01:37:20.160 --> 01:37:25.120]   And again, the iPhone 5 was generally higher in quality than the iPhone 4S.
[01:37:25.120 --> 01:37:31.080]   So I've got some, I put some feelers out to get some more resolution on this.
[01:37:31.080 --> 01:37:38.200]   But whatever the reason is, that is the one defect that I found in the iPhone 5 that there
[01:37:38.200 --> 01:37:42.980]   are, there have been situations over the past week in which I've taken shots with this phone
[01:37:42.980 --> 01:37:48.200]   and several others and the iPhone 5 was not able to produce a satisfactory image.
[01:37:48.200 --> 01:37:52.960]   So it doesn't, again, I won't speculate further on what the cause is and what the fix is,
[01:37:52.960 --> 01:37:56.880]   but that is whatever the reason that's something that I have been encountering.
[01:37:56.880 --> 01:37:58.640]   I think you nailed it.
[01:37:58.640 --> 01:37:59.640]   I think you nailed it.
[01:37:59.640 --> 01:38:02.200]   I have noticed exactly the same thing.
[01:38:02.200 --> 01:38:04.600]   And now that you mentioned, I'm going back through my pictures.
[01:38:04.600 --> 01:38:06.320]   It is in lower light pictures.
[01:38:06.320 --> 01:38:10.720]   I know I'm getting a good, steady shot, but there's, it looks like some sort of artifacting
[01:38:10.720 --> 01:38:11.720]   is going on.
[01:38:11.720 --> 01:38:12.720]   I think you nailed it.
[01:38:12.720 --> 01:38:15.040]   I think that that is that software.
[01:38:15.040 --> 01:38:20.040]   And you really only see it when you zoom in, but I think you're exactly right.
[01:38:20.040 --> 01:38:22.720]   It's using multi-pixels and we're getting artifacting.
[01:38:22.720 --> 01:38:25.760]   And it, because it doesn't just look blurry.
[01:38:25.760 --> 01:38:26.760]   It looks something odd.
[01:38:26.760 --> 01:38:27.760]   It looks soft.
[01:38:27.760 --> 01:38:28.760]   Right.
[01:38:28.760 --> 01:38:29.760]   Yeah.
[01:38:29.760 --> 01:38:30.760]   Yeah.
[01:38:30.760 --> 01:38:33.040]   And if it was frustrating that hell out of me because you don't, you don't want to say
[01:38:33.040 --> 01:38:35.680]   that this is a, this isn't a bad camera.
[01:38:35.680 --> 01:38:39.120]   I'm not saying that, but you don't want to say that I'm having a trouble, I'm having
[01:38:39.120 --> 01:38:42.880]   trouble getting this to take good pictures and I don't know the reason why.
[01:38:42.880 --> 01:38:46.760]   And that I believe I'm right, I don't know for fact I'm right, but again, whatever the
[01:38:46.760 --> 01:38:49.160]   reasons that's been a something's problem.
[01:38:49.160 --> 01:38:50.880]   The pano stuff is great.
[01:38:50.880 --> 01:38:51.880]   I have to say.
[01:38:51.880 --> 01:38:53.280]   The panorama is amazing.
[01:38:53.280 --> 01:38:58.440]   I, that one I tested with, I don't know if I didn't, I didn't post all the side by side
[01:38:58.440 --> 01:39:04.440]   photos, but I took it to a bunch of different places and took the same panorama with the
[01:39:04.440 --> 01:39:09.560]   iPhone five, excuse me, with iOS's parent panorama feature with auto stitch, which is
[01:39:09.560 --> 01:39:12.680]   my, which used to be my favorite panorama app.
[01:39:12.680 --> 01:39:17.280]   And actually with a 180 degree fish islands, like a super wide angle lens I have on my,
[01:39:17.280 --> 01:39:19.480]   my Panasonic camera.
[01:39:19.480 --> 01:39:26.360]   And man, if you, if I had to choose between the, the iPhone version and the GX one version,
[01:39:26.360 --> 01:39:31.240]   the Panasonic version, that would be a hard choice to make because they're both very beautiful
[01:39:31.240 --> 01:39:36.880]   and the iPhone five version just required me to stand still for about 15 seconds as opposed
[01:39:36.880 --> 01:39:40.480]   to carry $300 lens with me wherever I go.
[01:39:40.480 --> 01:39:41.480]   It's, it works.
[01:39:41.480 --> 01:39:42.480]   Panos are nice.
[01:39:42.480 --> 01:39:43.480]   It's gimmicky.
[01:39:43.480 --> 01:39:44.480]   You don't can take a lot of pants.
[01:39:44.480 --> 01:39:45.480]   Oh, well, it's, it's, well, it's funny.
[01:39:45.480 --> 01:39:48.800]   It gives you such a sense of presence and such a sense of place.
[01:39:48.800 --> 01:39:54.040]   It's not, it's not until I started, I first got the auto stitch program a few years ago
[01:39:54.040 --> 01:39:58.880]   as not until you go back to like all the trips that we've taken.
[01:39:58.880 --> 01:40:04.200]   I go back to the Forbidden City, this massive courtyard and I'm glad that I took a, I took
[01:40:04.200 --> 01:40:09.480]   a minute to just paint the entire area with these panorama photos and stitch them together
[01:40:09.480 --> 01:40:14.400]   because nothing brings you back there and to accept for having that beautiful 170 degree
[01:40:14.400 --> 01:40:16.400]   field of view.
[01:40:16.400 --> 01:40:19.400]   So it really was, it really was a terrific addition.
[01:40:19.400 --> 01:40:22.880]   I do, I do want to say one, one more thing though about the camera.
[01:40:22.880 --> 01:40:28.120]   People were asking me about the purple fringing, the purple flare problem.
[01:40:28.120 --> 01:40:34.440]   And I didn't notice it when I was, I don't, I don't test these things in response to things
[01:40:34.440 --> 01:40:35.440]   I've heard from other people.
[01:40:35.440 --> 01:40:39.000]   I hope to encounter a problem as opposed to try to force a problem.
[01:40:39.000 --> 01:40:43.640]   But a few days later, I did decide to try to create this problem that people have been
[01:40:43.640 --> 01:40:48.720]   warning me about where if you take a photo directly into the sun, A, there'll be a lens
[01:40:48.720 --> 01:40:51.880]   flare, B, that flare will be purple in color.
[01:40:51.880 --> 01:40:56.640]   It also happens if like there's a one source of one spotlight somewhere in the scene at
[01:40:56.640 --> 01:40:58.880]   the edge of the, at the, at the right spot.
[01:40:58.880 --> 01:41:01.400]   I was able to reproduce that.
[01:41:01.400 --> 01:41:05.500]   The problem was, in the review, I say that I don't consider it an issue because I did
[01:41:05.500 --> 01:41:09.640]   take out the other three phones to try to see what, how they would handle the same thing.
[01:41:09.640 --> 01:41:16.800]   All three of them handle that by also resulting in a flared, poor quality image.
[01:41:16.800 --> 01:41:20.040]   It's just that the iPhone 5 was a little bit worse than the others and it certainly was
[01:41:20.040 --> 01:41:21.040]   more purple than the others.
[01:41:21.040 --> 01:41:25.120]   But that didn't change the fact that even the best camera of the lot didn't give me a
[01:41:25.120 --> 01:41:26.520]   photo that I would be willing to use.
[01:41:26.520 --> 01:41:30.520]   So it was, if it was ruined by the purple flare, well, it was still been, in my opinion,
[01:41:30.520 --> 01:41:31.760]   would still have been a ruined image.
[01:41:31.760 --> 01:41:35.240]   So I don't really see that as an issue.
[01:41:35.240 --> 01:41:37.240]   Good enough.
[01:41:37.240 --> 01:41:43.720]   Uh, I think we are ready to, oh, one more thing, HTML5 New York Times app.
[01:41:43.720 --> 01:41:44.720]   This is kind of interesting.
[01:41:44.720 --> 01:41:49.880]   New York Times, of course, has a very good app for iOS, but they've also decided to do
[01:41:49.880 --> 01:41:55.160]   HTML5 for iOS.
[01:41:55.160 --> 01:41:57.720]   What's your take on that, Ryan?
[01:41:57.720 --> 01:41:58.880]   It doesn't scroll as well.
[01:41:58.880 --> 01:42:03.840]   It doesn't look as good, but it certainly means that the Times can have in-app purchases
[01:42:03.840 --> 01:42:06.760]   not give a little money to Apple, things like that.
[01:42:06.760 --> 01:42:10.200]   Yeah, I think there's a lot more flexibility.
[01:42:10.200 --> 01:42:11.200]   The web isn't dead yet.
[01:42:11.200 --> 01:42:12.200]   Thank God.
[01:42:12.200 --> 01:42:17.280]   It was obviously really important, but, you know, maybe the Times, which was really
[01:42:17.280 --> 01:42:25.600]   kind of the early standard bearer for, you know, Apple's publication integration, maybe
[01:42:25.600 --> 01:42:28.000]   they found that it's just not such a good deal after all.
[01:42:28.000 --> 01:42:34.680]   Maybe it's not, you know, so great to be, you know, just another icon within, you know,
[01:42:34.680 --> 01:42:40.080]   Apple's new stand and, you know, that they need to push their own agenda a little bit
[01:42:40.080 --> 01:42:41.080]   further.
[01:42:41.080 --> 01:42:45.760]   People pay close attention with the Times does, so that may be a bellwether I mentioned.
[01:42:45.760 --> 01:42:46.760]   Yeah.
[01:42:46.760 --> 01:42:48.960]   You know, I don't think that they're doing it uninformed, right?
[01:42:48.960 --> 01:42:51.000]   They're not flailing about with those kinds of decisions.
[01:42:51.000 --> 01:42:52.000]   Right.
[01:42:52.000 --> 01:42:53.000]   Right.
[01:42:53.000 --> 01:42:54.000]   No, they've been very thoughtful.
[01:42:54.000 --> 01:42:56.600]   I think Quartz is another reason that people are paying attention to that.
[01:42:56.600 --> 01:42:58.000]   Quartz is very interesting.
[01:42:58.000 --> 01:43:04.040]   This is a business site, HTML5 also, that's free.
[01:43:04.040 --> 01:43:11.400]   There's no paywall whatsoever, but has some very high-end advertisers booked in here
[01:43:11.400 --> 01:43:15.200]   like Boeing and Chevron and so forth.
[01:43:15.200 --> 01:43:21.200]   The interesting launch, qz.com, and it looks exactly the same on the desktop and on the
[01:43:21.200 --> 01:43:23.640]   on Safari, on the iPad.
[01:43:23.640 --> 01:43:26.960]   All right, we're going to take a break when we come back.
[01:43:26.960 --> 01:43:31.760]   Your picks of the week, gentlemen, if you've got some, a tip too, if you want.
[01:43:31.760 --> 01:43:37.200]   But before we do that, let's talk about a great use for your Kindle Fire, your iPad,
[01:43:37.200 --> 01:43:38.200]   your iPhone.
[01:43:38.200 --> 01:43:40.400]   It's audible.com and your ears.
[01:43:40.400 --> 01:43:41.800]   Good news for your ears.
[01:43:41.800 --> 01:43:42.800]   Good news for your ears.
[01:43:42.800 --> 01:43:47.160]   The best audiobooks in the world, more than 100,000 of them.
[01:43:47.160 --> 01:43:53.720]   In every arena, every topic, fiction, nonfiction history, I love reading history, unaudible,
[01:43:53.720 --> 01:43:58.480]   listening to history, unaudible because it's one of those categories that probably would
[01:43:58.480 --> 01:44:01.520]   take a backseat to novels if I didn't have more time to read.
[01:44:01.520 --> 01:44:06.440]   It's like you have to triage your reading, but because I get to read so much in the car
[01:44:06.440 --> 01:44:12.480]   commuting at the gym when I'm walking the dog, I can pick up books like the history of the
[01:44:12.480 --> 01:44:16.360]   Second World War, which I'm just concluding, just fascinating and still, you know, and still
[01:44:16.360 --> 01:44:17.360]   get to read those books.
[01:44:17.360 --> 01:44:19.040]   It really brought reading back into my life.
[01:44:19.040 --> 01:44:21.640]   I think that's what I am so grateful to audible for.
[01:44:21.640 --> 01:44:26.560]   I use the Audible app for iPhone, Android or Windows phone.
[01:44:26.560 --> 01:44:32.200]   All your books, your entire library, in my case, over 500 books available at any time,
[01:44:32.200 --> 01:44:34.560]   which is fantastic.
[01:44:34.560 --> 01:44:36.920]   You can download them and listen to them.
[01:44:36.920 --> 01:44:39.920]   You can do the whisper thing thing now, which is great.
[01:44:39.920 --> 01:44:45.960]   If you have it on an iPod and an iPhone and an iPad, you can go from one to the other
[01:44:45.960 --> 01:44:47.760]   and pick up where you left off.
[01:44:47.760 --> 01:44:51.240]   Andy, do you have a recommendation for us today for Audible?
[01:44:51.240 --> 01:44:56.080]   Yes, because today is actually the second or the third?
[01:44:56.080 --> 01:44:57.080]   Second.
[01:44:57.080 --> 01:45:01.600]   The second, which is the actual release date for John Hodgman's third in the trilogy of
[01:45:01.600 --> 01:45:05.480]   luminous information, that is all just released today.
[01:45:05.480 --> 01:45:11.560]   And it is third compendium of complete world knowledge read by John Hodgman, of course,
[01:45:11.560 --> 01:45:16.880]   16 hours, 35 minutes, so good, good week's worth of listening.
[01:45:16.880 --> 01:45:19.440]   And I've enjoyed this previous, the previous two.
[01:45:19.440 --> 01:45:25.080]   As a matter of fact, I enjoyed the first version as an audiobook so well that I actually didn't
[01:45:25.080 --> 01:45:27.840]   purchase the second one in as a book.
[01:45:27.840 --> 01:45:31.640]   I actually waited for the audio version to come out because it's just something about
[01:45:31.640 --> 01:45:36.400]   being in the car and having John Hodgman tell you secret knowledge that only he is privileged
[01:45:36.400 --> 01:45:41.160]   to and he's willing to share generously and gloriously and graciously with the rest of
[01:45:41.160 --> 01:45:42.160]   the world.
[01:45:42.160 --> 01:45:43.160]   And there's a lot of really.
[01:45:43.160 --> 01:45:45.080]   And he does more than just read the book, which is great.
[01:45:45.080 --> 01:45:47.280]   He makes these big multimedia productions.
[01:45:47.280 --> 01:45:48.400]   Jonathan Colton's on here.
[01:45:48.400 --> 01:45:49.400]   They perform a little bit.
[01:45:49.400 --> 01:45:53.560]   Dick Cavitt, John Hamm of Mad Men is on here.
[01:45:53.560 --> 01:45:56.720]   Paul Rudd, Sarah Val Brooks, shields.
[01:45:56.720 --> 01:46:00.200]   This guy, Rachel Madhouse, Steven Fry.
[01:46:00.200 --> 01:46:08.040]   It is a multimedia production and also music from, they might be giants, John Flansberg.
[01:46:08.040 --> 01:46:09.840]   That seems like a lot of entertainment.
[01:46:09.840 --> 01:46:10.840]   That's a lot of entertainment.
[01:46:10.840 --> 01:46:11.920]   Not too much entertainment.
[01:46:11.920 --> 01:46:14.640]   That seems like a lot of information for a very, very low set.
[01:46:14.640 --> 01:46:16.280]   And for free.
[01:46:16.280 --> 01:46:17.280]   And for free.
[01:46:17.280 --> 01:46:20.480]   Because if you go to audible.com/macbreak right now, you can get a free book.
[01:46:20.480 --> 01:46:21.640]   You'll sign up for the gold account.
[01:46:21.640 --> 01:46:23.720]   That's the book a month plan.
[01:46:23.720 --> 01:46:25.080]   But your first book is free.
[01:46:25.080 --> 01:46:26.080]   Your first month is free.
[01:46:26.080 --> 01:46:27.080]   Cancel it anytime.
[01:46:27.080 --> 01:46:28.280]   Keep that book forever.
[01:46:28.280 --> 01:46:29.280]   And this would be a very good choice.
[01:46:29.280 --> 01:46:33.360]   John will be joining us next triangulation tomorrow afternoon.
[01:46:33.360 --> 01:46:36.440]   3PM Pacific, 6PM Eastern time to talk about the book.
[01:46:36.440 --> 01:46:41.920]   And we have excerpts from the book on our website, twitter.tv/tri.
[01:46:41.920 --> 01:46:44.960]   Because Jonathan Colton and I talked a little bit, we played a little bit.
[01:46:44.960 --> 01:46:49.120]   And we had some excerpts from the book, pre-release version on our website.
[01:46:49.120 --> 01:46:52.160]   I think I need to quote Ryan now and say that I did not plan this.
[01:46:52.160 --> 01:46:54.120]   I did not co- we did not coordinate this.
[01:46:54.120 --> 01:46:56.040]   That just happened to be my selection for today.
[01:46:56.040 --> 01:46:57.040]   I do not know.
[01:46:57.040 --> 01:46:58.840]   It's a very good selection.
[01:46:58.840 --> 01:46:59.840]   It's just a matter.
[01:46:59.840 --> 01:47:02.440]   So I don't want to be accused of buzz marketing for three different.
[01:47:02.440 --> 01:47:04.240]   No, this is what I love.
[01:47:04.240 --> 01:47:08.200]   I don't have to stoop to tactics like that.
[01:47:08.200 --> 01:47:13.960]   Because when stuff is good, people know it and talk about it.
[01:47:13.960 --> 01:47:15.680]   Audible.com/MacBreak.
[01:47:15.680 --> 01:47:18.640]   Get a free book today and you know it really ought to be that is all.
[01:47:18.640 --> 01:47:20.240]   It just came out.
[01:47:20.240 --> 01:47:23.800]   John Hodgman's third in the trilogy.
[01:47:23.800 --> 01:47:28.440]   You should also get areas of my expertise, which was the first.
[01:47:28.440 --> 01:47:29.440]   What was the second one?
[01:47:29.440 --> 01:47:30.440]   I don't remember.
[01:47:30.440 --> 01:47:31.440]   More information than you require.
[01:47:31.440 --> 01:47:32.440]   That's right.
[01:47:32.440 --> 01:47:34.360]   I have all three of course.
[01:47:34.360 --> 01:47:35.840]   Audible.com/MacBreak.
[01:47:35.840 --> 01:47:43.400]   We thank you so much for their long time support of MacBreak Weekly and the iOS platform.
[01:47:43.400 --> 01:47:45.600]   You got an iOS or a Mac?
[01:47:45.600 --> 01:47:48.400]   How about a Macpick?
[01:47:48.400 --> 01:47:49.400]   Anybody?
[01:47:49.400 --> 01:47:50.400]   Macpick?
[01:47:50.400 --> 01:47:51.400]   Bueller?
[01:47:51.400 --> 01:47:52.400]   Nevermind.
[01:47:52.400 --> 01:47:53.400]   Nevermind.
[01:47:53.400 --> 01:47:54.400]   Forget it.
[01:47:54.400 --> 01:47:58.640]   I'm really enjoying the Tweetbot beta.
[01:47:58.640 --> 01:48:00.240]   I'm not sure if you can.
[01:48:00.240 --> 01:48:02.240]   Is it out yet?
[01:48:02.240 --> 01:48:03.240]   It's still in beta.
[01:48:03.240 --> 01:48:05.600]   It's not officially out yet.
[01:48:05.600 --> 01:48:12.160]   They can't take because of the way that Twitter has done user registrations or user tokens
[01:48:12.160 --> 01:48:14.240]   for apps.
[01:48:14.240 --> 01:48:15.240]   They're maxed out.
[01:48:15.240 --> 01:48:16.720]   You can't really get in the beta.
[01:48:16.720 --> 01:48:20.800]   I'm sure they love that more beta users, but they can because of Twitter's limitations.
[01:48:20.800 --> 01:48:25.200]   But if you had it, they just issued an update for it this morning.
[01:48:25.200 --> 01:48:26.840]   They've been fixing a lot of bugs.
[01:48:26.840 --> 01:48:29.160]   It's such a good desktop Twitter experience.
[01:48:29.160 --> 01:48:30.320]   I can't wait.
[01:48:30.320 --> 01:48:32.920]   I so hate the Twitter apps.
[01:48:32.920 --> 01:48:33.920]   I don't use Twitter.
[01:48:33.920 --> 01:48:38.600]   In fact, that's one of the real drawbacks frankly of Android is they don't have Tweetbot
[01:48:38.600 --> 01:48:39.600]   on the Android.
[01:48:39.600 --> 01:48:40.600]   I wish they did.
[01:48:40.600 --> 01:48:45.080]   I have to use the Twitter app because there's nothing decent on Android.
[01:48:45.080 --> 01:48:48.160]   But if you're an iOS user, absolutely you've got to use Tweetbot.
[01:48:48.160 --> 01:48:51.520]   I cannot wait to see it on the desktop from Tapbots.com.
[01:48:51.520 --> 01:48:52.520]   I think...
[01:48:52.520 --> 01:48:54.000]   I will say this.
[01:48:54.000 --> 01:48:58.000]   When it is out officially, when it properly launches, buy it.
[01:48:58.000 --> 01:49:03.360]   Whatever they're selling it for, $5, $10, $20 doesn't matter.
[01:49:03.360 --> 01:49:04.360]   Buy it.
[01:49:04.360 --> 01:49:05.360]   It's really good.
[01:49:05.360 --> 01:49:06.360]   I use those 4.0 right now.
[01:49:06.360 --> 01:49:11.360]   I was 4.0 is both on the iOS and the Mac platform.
[01:49:11.360 --> 01:49:12.360]   Pretty good.
[01:49:12.360 --> 01:49:14.840]   But I'm a big fan of Tweetbot.
[01:49:14.840 --> 01:49:16.360]   I know I'll be buying that.
[01:49:16.360 --> 01:49:17.800]   The minute it comes out.
[01:49:17.800 --> 01:49:18.800]   It's a Mac pick.
[01:49:18.800 --> 01:49:20.520]   There you go.
[01:49:20.520 --> 01:49:21.520]   See?
[01:49:21.520 --> 01:49:23.200]   You can't get it.
[01:49:23.200 --> 01:49:24.200]   But soon.
[01:49:24.200 --> 01:49:25.920]   It's coming through for you, Leah.
[01:49:25.920 --> 01:49:27.400]   Soon you can get it.
[01:49:27.400 --> 01:49:30.160]   How about you, Andy and I go, you got a pick for us this week?
[01:49:30.160 --> 01:49:31.160]   Yes.
[01:49:31.160 --> 01:49:33.280]   I got an interesting pick for you this week.
[01:49:33.280 --> 01:49:37.120]   Those of you who are in the audio, have heard of the brand of audio technique.
[01:49:37.120 --> 01:49:38.120]   Yes.
[01:49:38.120 --> 01:49:40.760]   Well, they've been branching out.
[01:49:40.760 --> 01:49:43.560]   They now have a new line of cabernet.
[01:49:43.560 --> 01:49:44.560]   No.
[01:49:44.560 --> 01:49:48.080]   This is their 50th anniversary.
[01:49:48.080 --> 01:49:49.840]   That's hysterical.
[01:49:49.840 --> 01:49:50.840]   Oh.
[01:49:50.840 --> 01:49:55.880]   And which basically it arrived a few days ago.
[01:49:55.880 --> 01:49:59.720]   I sampled it with a saucy steak the other day.
[01:49:59.720 --> 01:50:03.360]   And it sort of like it begs you to make all kinds of jokes about it.
[01:50:03.360 --> 01:50:05.280]   It has a rich full bottom.
[01:50:05.280 --> 01:50:08.320]   No popping really that I could really mention about it.
[01:50:08.320 --> 01:50:10.880]   A bright, bright top end.
[01:50:10.880 --> 01:50:16.920]   That's just sort of a reminder to I can't be bought, but I can be fed and be given booze.
[01:50:16.920 --> 01:50:19.560]   So in addition, so exchange.
[01:50:19.560 --> 01:50:22.720]   We all thought it was sugar king Coke.
[01:50:22.720 --> 01:50:26.400]   Oh, yum, yum, yum.
[01:50:26.400 --> 01:50:27.880]   That's a good tip.
[01:50:27.880 --> 01:50:29.600]   So says Andy, not to go back briefly.
[01:50:29.600 --> 01:50:31.720]   But yeah, I like audio technique a lot.
[01:50:31.720 --> 01:50:33.120]   If they are booze, is this good?
[01:50:33.120 --> 01:50:37.880]   I can only imagine how wonderful these microphones are.
[01:50:37.880 --> 01:50:39.880]   You need a new needle for your turntable.
[01:50:39.880 --> 01:50:43.480]   I'd say you go to the same guys who gave me this bottle of lovely lovely.
[01:50:43.480 --> 01:50:46.640]   Well, on that note, I think we should just wrap this thing up.
[01:50:46.640 --> 01:50:47.640]   That's all I can say.
[01:50:47.640 --> 01:50:48.960]   Hey, it's great to have you, Andy.
[01:50:48.960 --> 01:50:55.640]   I will look for your review of the iPhone 5 camera in today's Chicago Sun times.
[01:50:55.640 --> 01:50:59.520]   And of course, you should always look for Andy's Chicago Sun times pieces.
[01:50:59.520 --> 01:51:02.480]   The greatest stuff you can also find him on the web.
[01:51:02.480 --> 01:51:08.200]   www.cwob, proudly celebrating four years in beta.
[01:51:08.200 --> 01:51:09.960]   And probably four more to come.
[01:51:09.960 --> 01:51:15.240]   Still waiting for that second level of angel funding.
[01:51:15.240 --> 01:51:19.640]   Actually, we also want to thank Ryan Block, who's going to be out your way at gadget.com,
[01:51:19.640 --> 01:51:21.040]   gdgt.com.
[01:51:21.040 --> 01:51:23.400]   You're doing a Boston gadget show, aren't you?
[01:51:23.400 --> 01:51:24.400]   We are.
[01:51:24.400 --> 01:51:25.400]   We are doing one this month.
[01:51:25.400 --> 01:51:26.400]   That's exciting.
[01:51:26.400 --> 01:51:27.400]   It's on events.gagit.com.
[01:51:27.400 --> 01:51:33.240]   You can sign up RSVP there, but we are doing it in Boston on the 17th.
[01:51:33.240 --> 01:51:39.400]   If you have not been to an gadget event, really a great way to see all the latest stuff, this
[01:51:39.400 --> 01:51:40.720]   will be at the Beijou nightclub.
[01:51:40.720 --> 01:51:43.600]   I know you've been there many times, Andy.
[01:51:43.600 --> 01:51:44.600]   Out there on Stubert's.
[01:51:44.600 --> 01:51:45.600]   Don't remember a single time, man.
[01:51:45.600 --> 01:51:49.800]   Yeah, that's how you know how good time I had.
[01:51:49.800 --> 01:51:55.920]   Great way to check out new technology, RSVP@events.gggt.com.
[01:51:55.920 --> 01:51:57.520]   Maybe you'll have that new sling box there.
[01:51:57.520 --> 01:52:01.720]   I hear that sling box has two new devices that were kind of accidentally left out in
[01:52:01.720 --> 01:52:02.720]   the best buy.
[01:52:02.720 --> 01:52:04.600]   Yeah, I'm not sure.
[01:52:04.600 --> 01:52:05.600]   We'll see.
[01:52:05.600 --> 01:52:08.000]   You have a sponsor, maybe.
[01:52:08.000 --> 01:52:09.560]   Maybe.
[01:52:09.560 --> 01:52:15.640]   And of course, gdgt.com is the place to get your aggregate interviews and more.
[01:52:15.640 --> 01:52:20.680]   Your don't forget the promo area of the dock.
[01:52:20.680 --> 01:52:22.280]   Oh, let's go look.
[01:52:22.280 --> 01:52:23.440]   Could have just told you that.
[01:52:23.440 --> 01:52:25.440]   You could have just said that out loud instead of.
[01:52:25.440 --> 01:52:27.440]   Why don't you check the promo area, the dot?
[01:52:27.440 --> 01:52:28.440]   Leo reading.
[01:52:28.440 --> 01:52:29.440]   Right.
[01:52:29.440 --> 01:52:31.080]   So Chad has this like ticker tape.
[01:52:31.080 --> 01:52:32.080]   Are you taking mesmerized?
[01:52:32.080 --> 01:52:34.080]   He has this ticker tape at.
[01:52:34.080 --> 01:52:37.640]   Oh, you're doing an ask me anything.
[01:52:37.640 --> 01:52:41.080]   That's neat on Reddit right now.
[01:52:41.080 --> 01:52:42.080]   Ryan?
[01:52:42.080 --> 01:52:43.080]   I'm sorry.
[01:52:43.080 --> 01:52:44.640]   Are you doing an ask me anything?
[01:52:44.640 --> 01:52:45.640]   I am.
[01:52:45.640 --> 01:52:46.640]   I'm doing an AMA on Reddit right now.
[01:52:46.640 --> 01:52:51.520]   I'm sure all the Reddit people are kind of frustrated because I started the AMA like an
[01:52:51.520 --> 01:52:53.720]   hour before I came on the show.
[01:52:53.720 --> 01:52:59.120]   So I tried to answer as many questions as I could on the AMA before Mac break weekly.
[01:52:59.120 --> 01:53:00.120]   That's fine.
[01:53:00.120 --> 01:53:07.200]   I'm back and everybody should visit Reddit.com/r/iama and you can read Ryan Blocks.
[01:53:07.200 --> 01:53:08.760]   Ask me anything.
[01:53:08.760 --> 01:53:12.600]   Oh, oh, some, some, oh, no.
[01:53:12.600 --> 01:53:13.600]   Okay.
[01:53:13.600 --> 01:53:14.600]   I'm not going to read that question.
[01:53:14.600 --> 01:53:16.440]   Oh, oh my goodness.
[01:53:16.440 --> 01:53:19.680]   Oh, you're very, you're very honest.
[01:53:19.680 --> 01:53:20.680]   That's good.
[01:53:20.680 --> 01:53:22.440]   This is good stuff.
[01:53:22.440 --> 01:53:28.000]   If you want to learn more about Ryan Blocks than you ever thought you would.
[01:53:28.000 --> 01:53:32.040]   You know, anything you learn about me is far too much information.
[01:53:32.040 --> 01:53:33.880]   Far too much information.
[01:53:33.880 --> 01:53:35.840]   I don't know if anything is wrong.
[01:53:35.840 --> 01:53:38.120]   And Veronica makes a cameo.
[01:53:38.120 --> 01:53:39.120]   She does.
[01:53:39.120 --> 01:53:41.360]   She doesn't make a cameo.
[01:53:41.360 --> 01:53:44.800]   In exactly the right place, I might add.
[01:53:44.800 --> 01:53:45.840]   Really, really great.
[01:53:45.840 --> 01:53:49.760]   What else do I have in the promo section of the, of the rundown?
[01:53:49.760 --> 01:53:50.760]   Let me just see.
[01:53:50.760 --> 01:53:51.760]   Oh, we've got T-shirts.
[01:53:51.760 --> 01:53:55.600]   We got to mention that we are running out of time now on our T-spring shirts.
[01:53:55.600 --> 01:53:59.200]   10 days left with this is something we're going to do now more often, I think, is a one
[01:53:59.200 --> 01:54:01.240]   time only, one month only deal.
[01:54:01.240 --> 01:54:06.440]   This is the special edition Twit T-shirt with all the names of the shows in the background
[01:54:06.440 --> 01:54:07.440]   of the Twit logo.
[01:54:07.440 --> 01:54:11.280]   One of our listeners that designed this for us, Twit.tv in the front.
[01:54:11.280 --> 01:54:15.400]   $20, nice quality American apparel or fruit of the loom, your choice.
[01:54:15.400 --> 01:54:17.000]   All sizes available.
[01:54:17.000 --> 01:54:21.080]   The campaign has reached its goal, but we won't begin printing them for 10 more days.
[01:54:21.080 --> 01:54:23.120]   So that means you have 10 days to get in on this.
[01:54:23.120 --> 01:54:24.520]   And once it's done, it's done.
[01:54:24.520 --> 01:54:26.720]   We won't make these ever again.
[01:54:26.720 --> 01:54:28.560]   So it's, you know what's nice?
[01:54:28.560 --> 01:54:32.120]   Chad, I think we've sold 1,471 shirts.
[01:54:32.120 --> 01:54:34.840]   I think we are close to our goal.
[01:54:34.840 --> 01:54:37.880]   We were going to use this to buy an elemental, right?
[01:54:37.880 --> 01:54:41.720]   The streaming hardware that we need, which is close to $20,000.
[01:54:41.720 --> 01:54:46.360]   And I think we might, well, certainly if we get to say 500, let's say we get to 2,000,
[01:54:46.360 --> 01:54:47.360]   that would be nice.
[01:54:47.360 --> 01:54:48.800]   That will be enough money to buy the element.
[01:54:48.800 --> 01:54:50.960]   That'll take a nice dint out of the cost.
[01:54:50.960 --> 01:54:51.960]   Yes.
[01:54:51.960 --> 01:54:53.280]   And then our streaming will be much more reliable.
[01:54:53.280 --> 01:54:55.280]   It won't crash on you in the middle of the show.
[01:54:55.280 --> 01:54:58.000]   So it's all in a good cause.
[01:54:58.000 --> 01:55:05.240]   The URL is T-W-E-Spring, T-Spring.com/twit, if you'd like to get one.
[01:55:05.240 --> 01:55:08.720]   And we are taking a designs for the next shirt we're going to do.
[01:55:08.720 --> 01:55:10.280]   It might be a hat or a mug.
[01:55:10.280 --> 01:55:12.600]   It doesn't have to be a shirt.
[01:55:12.600 --> 01:55:13.600]   Right.
[01:55:13.600 --> 01:55:14.600]   Think about it.
[01:55:14.600 --> 01:55:16.840]   T-Spring.com/twit.
[01:55:16.840 --> 01:55:20.960]   RyanBloch, gadget.com, Andy Inako, Chicago Sun-Times.
[01:55:20.960 --> 01:55:21.960]   Thank you for being here.
[01:55:21.960 --> 01:55:22.960]   Thank you for joining us.
[01:55:22.960 --> 01:55:23.960]   Always fun.
[01:55:23.960 --> 01:55:24.960]   We'll see you next time.
[01:55:24.960 --> 01:55:27.760]   Now, back to work because break time is over.
