[00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:14.240]   came out today with some problems.
[00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:15.480]   But we've got the fix.

[00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:47.200]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly, the show where we talk about the latest Apple news.
[00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:51.200]   It's been a bit of Apple news this week.
[00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:55.640]   Joining us now, Andy Anakko, you was here last week right before the, that's Renee Richie,
[00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:56.640]   that's good.
[00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:57.480]   Here he is, Andy Anakko.
[00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:02.360]   He was here for the keynote and the Mac Break Weekly after.
[00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:06.360]   So we have already obsessively discussed everything new from Apple.
[00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:09.880]   Yes, but now it's a week later and now we actually know what we're talking about.
[00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:11.400]   That makes it more fun.
[00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:15.240]   Because we've talked to people who are engineers and who know what they're talking about.
[00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:18.280]   And engineers, you can't live with them, you can't live without?
[00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:20.000]   No, that's the wrong joke.
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.760]   Also joining us, Renee Richie back from his jaunt to San Francisco.
[00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:24.760]   Jeff fun?
[00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:25.760]   I did.
[00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:26.760]   It was great.
[00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:28.200]   It was much cooler than it was here for once.
[00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:29.200]   Yeah.
[00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:30.200]   It's usually pretty cool.
[00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:37.280]   San Francisco warms up in September and October, but it's usually pretty cool.
[00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:39.120]   So, which phone did you get?
[00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:41.480]   You probably, you got a review unit I'm guessing, right?
[00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:43.000]   They did a lot of review units.
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.480]   The reviews that came out today, I think.
[00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:45.480]   Today, I was surprised.
[00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:46.480]   Yeah.
[00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:47.480]   Yeah, I would have both.
[00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:49.600]   Like, I always get the smaller one and the bigger one because I feel like I need to spend
[00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:50.600]   a year with both of them.
[00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:52.960]   I only get black, I presume, right?
[00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:56.400]   Jeff Black for the six, for the seven plus and matte black for the seven.
[00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:57.400]   Good.
[00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:58.400]   The two new colors.
[00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:59.400]   You got to see this too.
[00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:00.400]   Yeah.
[00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:01.400]   Yeah.
[00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:02.400]   They're unboring.
[00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:03.960]   And also, I mean, the jet black looks amazing, but I think some people are going to be turned
[00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:05.400]   off by fingerprints and scuffs.
[00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:09.400]   And the matte black doesn't look quite as hot, but it is very impressive in person.
[00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:10.760]   Well, I have a stealth.
[00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:11.760]   Yeah.
[00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:14.480]   I wish they called it stealth black because I like, I really like that surface.
[00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:15.480]   Yeah.
[00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:16.840]   Well, I may regret it.
[00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:19.520]   I got the jet black, but I won't get it till October.
[00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:21.720]   I presume that's when it's like the 3GS.
[00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:23.920]   It's just the same kind of glossy back.
[00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:24.920]   That was plastic.
[00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:25.920]   Yeah.
[00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:29.160]   This just, this is a, they figured out a way to make it glossy and aluminum and it dies
[00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:30.160]   at the same time.
[00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:31.160]   Same effect.
[00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:32.160]   I may regret it, whatever.
[00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:34.240]   Well, like if it's full of chances.
[00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:38.920]   You either put it in a case or you own it like Indiana Jones does his leather wear.
[00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:40.920]   Right.
[00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:43.960]   And then do Renee, when do you get yours?
[00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:48.400]   I have, I can't comment on whether or not I have anything else, but I'm getting the
[00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:49.400]   water.
[00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:50.400]   Wait, you're still in barcode?
[00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:54.680]   Everybody, all the Steve Kovacs review came out and Drew Cunningham's.
[00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:56.000]   There are waves, Leo.
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   Oh, they come.
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.360]   They, that's even worse.
[00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:00.800]   So now they tell you, this is ridiculous.
[00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:02.760]   Wait a minute.
[00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:06.560]   They tell you, well, you can't tell me what they tell you.
[00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:10.360]   I did order one in my, and the first one is arriving on Friday and the second one's
[00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:11.360]   arriving a week.
[00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:12.360]   Let me talk to Andy momentarily.
[00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:14.920]   By the time I ordered the plus, it was already pushed back a week.
[00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:16.840]   Andy, is it your sense?
[00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:21.520]   It's certainly mine that some journalists get to get to publish before others.
[00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:23.800]   Oh, that, that's always the sense.
[00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:25.720]   But that's not in the past, isn't it?
[00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:29.680]   In the past, hasn't always been everybody gets one, you know, okay, at midnight Tuesday,
[00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:30.680]   you could publish your reviews.
[00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:31.680]   It's always very few people.
[00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:34.000]   Like the first wave reviews have always a dozen people or so.
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.040]   And that's like the groupers and dowramples and New York Times in Washington.
[00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:44.120]   You know, I mean, I can understand the embargo because, but to then say, oh, and by the way,
[00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:47.360]   you get to publish first, that is appalling.
[00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:49.480]   That is just bad management.
[00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:52.200]   No, I think that's how would you justify that?
[00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:56.160]   It's well, I would justify it that Apple's a privately owned company that they don't have
[00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:59.720]   to loan or loan or give hardware to anybody.
[00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:05.080]   And so if you and everybody who wants to needs to do their job can do their job without
[00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:08.280]   any of Apple's help whatsoever, which you and I choose to do.
[00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:09.280]   So it's the same.
[00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:12.680]   I get lots of help from Apple.
[00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:17.720]   My review will be of a loaner because I can't simply buy a hundred dollars phone just for
[00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:19.520]   my library.
[00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:23.520]   But if I found out that Apple was not going to loan me hardware, I would buy you either
[00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:24.520]   buy hardware.
[00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:28.560]   Let's put it in context though.
[00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:30.400]   I mean, okay, it's Apple.
[00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:34.120]   But what if another company played favorites among journalists like that?
[00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:35.120]   Well, I mean, they do.
[00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:37.640]   Like with the Android companies too, it's like there's wave one, there's wave two.
[00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:40.480]   Sometimes you get it after release, sometimes you get it before release, sometimes you wait
[00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:42.160]   till someone else returns theirs.
[00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:43.160]   And then you get it.
[00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:49.000]   Don't they understand the strong impression that gives that certain journalists not only
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.040]   are favored but are in Apple's pocket?
[00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:57.000]   No, that's that's only like that's one.
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.480]   Apple picks one guy that hates him and gives it that says you too.
[00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:01.480]   Yeah.
[00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:04.240]   No, I mean, really, I mean, that way too much is made about that.
[00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:09.280]   I think that I think there is a danger of an individual journalist feeling that, oh my
[00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:15.560]   God, I've been blessed with this device and some, not just Apple, but some companies.
[00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:20.280]   When I've made a secret trip to New York to be quietly go to a suite and I've brought
[00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:24.280]   a really large empty backpack, that's going to be full when I leave.
[00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:27.480]   It will never be unzipped until I'm back in my hotel room.
[00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:30.680]   Often times able to try to know, you know that even David Pogue isn't getting one of
[00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:31.680]   these.
[00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:33.600]   Or do you know that only six people are getting these?
[00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:37.680]   And if I were only doing, if I'd only been doing this for a year, like, oh my goodness,
[00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:38.680]   I'm special.
[00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:42.760]   I certainly don't want to do anything to ruin this special, special arrangement.
[00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:44.600]   But I'm obviously quite old.
[00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:46.800]   So I'm like, oh, isn't that nice?
[00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:48.560]   Thank you very much.
[00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:53.520]   So really this thing does get written about every once in a while, but I think that so
[00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:58.000]   the responsibilities on the journalists to prove to the readers that yes, that's nice.
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:01.720]   You're taking advantage of this because it's a way to get information in the hands of your
[00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:06.960]   readers before, maybe before they've had a chance to order, which is when they're really
[00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:08.800]   looking for this information.
[00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:12.760]   As long as you're not making it clear that you're just, what I'm always suspicious of
[00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:17.000]   is those reviews were 50% of it is how hush hush this meeting was.
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:21.880]   And I was ushered into a special suite in the back of, yeah, very nice for you, for you,
[00:07:21.880 --> 00:07:22.880]   you, trial faz.
[00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:24.360]   Just tell us about the camera.
[00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:26.360]   Did it take good pictures or not?
[00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:28.600]   That's why I order because I never assume I'm going to get anything.
[00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:32.560]   And it's my job to do it regardless if I get any, you know, any briefings, any review units
[00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:33.560]   at all.
[00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:37.760]   I didn't and now I've usually gotten it at some point in the launch, but never in the
[00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:38.760]   first wave.
[00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:41.520]   And again, I still, like Andy said, I have to show up and do my job.
[00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:42.720]   Yeah, but you have a, you have a question.
[00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:43.720]   Of course you do.
[00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:47.880]   I just, it just gives the general public the impression that the tech press in general
[00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:50.080]   is in the bag to the companies they cover.
[00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:51.760]   Well, there are a lot of bizpups too.
[00:07:51.760 --> 00:07:55.680]   Like again, it's New York Times and Wall Street Journal and USA Today and Tech Radar and
[00:07:55.680 --> 00:07:56.680]   TV.
[00:07:56.680 --> 00:07:58.760]   That's why I don't play that stupid game.
[00:07:58.760 --> 00:08:03.320]   But it's just unfortunate because I feel like, you know, in general trade press, you know,
[00:08:03.320 --> 00:08:08.320]   people assume that auto magazines don't, you know, they don't really, they're really
[00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:10.280]   objective about the stuff they cover.
[00:08:10.280 --> 00:08:16.120]   And increasingly we're thinking that beltway journalism is highly colored by the amount
[00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:17.120]   of interest.
[00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:18.120]   Oh, did you see that?
[00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:21.160]   I had a little thread that got surfaced about auto, auto bloggers complaining about the
[00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:22.560]   lack of gifts at some cars.
[00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:23.560]   Exactly.
[00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:26.560]   You couldn't believe that they didn't get thousands of dollars worth of swag for showing
[00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:28.120]   up and driving the supercar.
[00:08:28.120 --> 00:08:29.120]   Yeah.
[00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:34.120]   And to start off with the big flown first class to the Nurbigering.
[00:08:34.120 --> 00:08:35.120]   Yeah.
[00:08:35.120 --> 00:08:44.080]   Like, you know, I've had like a company pay for one trip of mine ever and it was to Chicago
[00:08:44.080 --> 00:08:48.240]   overnight only because I was going to see if the world would end.
[00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:52.240]   And the world didn't end, but I decided it was for Motorola launch and I did disclose
[00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:54.400]   if I'm like, okay, I don't have to do that.
[00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:55.640]   I don't have to do that again.
[00:08:55.640 --> 00:08:56.640]   And movie junk gets me.
[00:08:56.640 --> 00:08:57.640]   They're famous for just flying people.
[00:08:57.640 --> 00:08:58.640]   I know.
[00:08:58.640 --> 00:08:59.640]   I know.
[00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:00.640]   Watch the preview.
[00:09:00.640 --> 00:09:03.560]   It's one thing actually if an institution I think protects you a little bit.
[00:09:03.560 --> 00:09:09.120]   So if the Wall Street Journal gets a review phone or the USA Today gets a review phone,
[00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:13.920]   even though that's going specifically to Joanna Stern or Ed Begg, I think the fact that the
[00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:19.320]   institution is the actual, you know, reviewer probably protects you.
[00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:26.760]   The problem is that increasingly these people are individual bloggers and Apple really loves
[00:09:26.760 --> 00:09:27.760]   individual bloggers.
[00:09:27.760 --> 00:09:29.480]   Youtubers now or youtubers.
[00:09:29.480 --> 00:09:30.600]   Yeah, precisely.
[00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:32.800]   And so the companies, this is real.
[00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:35.480]   And then you have a direct relationship with that.
[00:09:35.480 --> 00:09:36.480]   Any buffer.
[00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:38.240]   Well, and I think that's.
[00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:41.840]   I think almost I think they have a direct relationship with almost everybody.
[00:09:41.840 --> 00:09:45.640]   I mean, they they have a direct relationship with me, not with the Sun times.
[00:09:45.640 --> 00:09:49.160]   They have direct relationship with Joanna.
[00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:56.280]   If if someone were to say to move from Mashable to Gizmodo, this person is starting all over
[00:09:56.280 --> 00:09:57.280]   again.
[00:09:57.280 --> 00:09:58.280]   It's right.
[00:09:58.280 --> 00:09:59.280]   She brings all one of the.
[00:09:59.280 --> 00:10:00.280]   Well, that's the strength of the journalist.
[00:10:00.280 --> 00:10:01.280]   Right.
[00:10:01.280 --> 00:10:02.280]   Their content.
[00:10:02.280 --> 00:10:03.280]   Right.
[00:10:03.280 --> 00:10:06.600]   She's so attractive to to Gizmodo is not only because of her immense talent, but also because
[00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:08.320]   she knows who to talk to.
[00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:13.200]   If if phones start catching on fire, she knows who to talk to about to get the straight
[00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:14.200]   dope.
[00:10:14.200 --> 00:10:18.520]   But yeah, I mean, it's something people should be wary of, but that's that's the difference
[00:10:18.520 --> 00:10:24.480]   between having five or 10 years of experience and being somewhat new.
[00:10:24.480 --> 00:10:30.560]   The new people can be just as honest and just as strong, but they really do have to work.
[00:10:30.560 --> 00:10:34.240]   I think three times as hard as someone like I do because I can just point to, well, look
[00:10:34.240 --> 00:10:38.280]   here, here is the past 15 years of reviews I've done with Apple.
[00:10:38.280 --> 00:10:41.320]   Show me that I've given every time I've said anything positive.
[00:10:41.320 --> 00:10:45.920]   It has been backed up by data and show me that I've never said anything negative.
[00:10:45.920 --> 00:10:48.880]   I forget for instance, I think the number of crap I'm getting the amount of crap I'm getting
[00:10:48.880 --> 00:10:50.680]   for the past few months about big.
[00:10:50.680 --> 00:10:55.680]   But what is it?
[00:10:55.680 --> 00:10:58.680]   You just hate Apple all the time.
[00:10:58.680 --> 00:11:01.680]   Like, no, I don't want to belabor it.
[00:11:01.680 --> 00:11:04.680]   I just I'm just going to build all the phone.
[00:11:04.680 --> 00:11:05.680]   It's good.
[00:11:05.680 --> 00:11:09.680]   I just I am the sun and the rain that shines and rains upon all companies equal.
[00:11:09.680 --> 00:11:12.680]   All right, we're going to move on, but I just wanted to mention it for two reasons.
[00:11:12.680 --> 00:11:16.680]   First of all, I didn't realize that some people were allowed to print their reviews before
[00:11:16.680 --> 00:11:18.680]   others, which I just shocked me.
[00:11:18.680 --> 00:11:20.680]   Before the second round review units even go out.
[00:11:20.680 --> 00:11:21.680]   Wow.
[00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:26.080]   Well, that I understand because you have that that comes from the yes, probably not true,
[00:11:26.080 --> 00:11:29.440]   but a reasonable assumption that we have a limited number of review units.
[00:11:29.440 --> 00:11:31.840]   And so we're to send them to you first, then you for you.
[00:11:31.840 --> 00:11:36.680]   But if everybody has a phone, but you can print your review before you.
[00:11:36.680 --> 00:11:37.680]   I don't think that's the case.
[00:11:37.680 --> 00:11:38.680]   I don't think anybody's.
[00:11:38.680 --> 00:11:39.680]   Oh, okay.
[00:11:39.680 --> 00:11:40.680]   Yes.
[00:11:40.680 --> 00:11:41.680]   I understood that.
[00:11:41.680 --> 00:11:44.720]   And then even I think it's also the reason I bring it up because really this is such inside
[00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:45.720]   baseball.
[00:11:45.720 --> 00:11:47.520]   I don't expect you to care.
[00:11:47.520 --> 00:11:53.440]   But you should know as a listener and a consumer of product reviews that this stuff happens.
[00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:54.440]   So you can make their judgment.
[00:11:54.440 --> 00:11:56.040]   Oh, Nick and Son had a great post about it.
[00:11:56.040 --> 00:11:59.160]   And he said, yeah, I get free phones, but I have to travel three days out of every week.
[00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:02.400]   I don't get to see my kids after pay for everything going there and back.
[00:12:02.400 --> 00:12:04.520]   I would much rather just buy the phone if I had that.
[00:12:04.520 --> 00:12:05.520]   Oh, believe me.
[00:12:05.520 --> 00:12:08.000]   I feel very fortunate that I don't have to deal with PR people in any way.
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:12.280]   And when they call on contact, I ignore them and I'm happy and happy to do so.
[00:12:12.280 --> 00:12:17.360]   And I don't find that that sometimes it's nice to be able to talk to engineers.
[00:12:17.360 --> 00:12:22.080]   That's the thing I miss is that to be able to talk to the PR people I don't miss.
[00:12:22.080 --> 00:12:25.400]   Although many of them are quite lovely as individuals.
[00:12:25.400 --> 00:12:30.720]   But I do miss sometimes having the access to the engineers and the designers and insight.
[00:12:30.720 --> 00:12:36.880]   Like John Petchkowski had great access to why the headphone jack was removed.
[00:12:36.880 --> 00:12:40.760]   The challenge of course is you understand that Apple is giving you this access, John,
[00:12:40.760 --> 00:12:46.320]   so that you will write a story basically explaining their position, justifying their position.
[00:12:46.320 --> 00:12:48.240]   The story was better than the one they gave on stage.
[00:12:48.240 --> 00:12:49.240]   Yeah.
[00:12:49.240 --> 00:12:51.080]   Well, and that's the irony of it.
[00:12:51.080 --> 00:12:53.480]   It wasn't, well, we've got courage.
[00:12:53.480 --> 00:12:55.480]   It was, well, here's the legitimate reasons.
[00:12:55.480 --> 00:12:57.800]   David Pogue also came on the screensavers on Saturday.
[00:12:57.800 --> 00:12:59.320]   He also was briefed.
[00:12:59.320 --> 00:13:03.320]   And I'll buy the notion that the headphone jack takes up a lot of space.
[00:13:03.320 --> 00:13:10.160]   I think the counter argument is, well, why does the, for instance, Note 7 have a headphone
[00:13:10.160 --> 00:13:13.480]   jack and a pen and its smaller body with a bigger screen?
[00:13:13.480 --> 00:13:16.720]   I mean, it can't be, I mean, there.
[00:13:16.720 --> 00:13:19.000]   Yeah, it's a difficult thing.
[00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:22.720]   That's why in a column that's been filed that hasn't been printed yet.
[00:13:22.720 --> 00:13:27.880]   Basically I'm saying that the Apple has a perfectly 100% inarguable reason for removing
[00:13:27.880 --> 00:13:28.880]   the headphone jack.
[00:13:28.880 --> 00:13:31.960]   And that is that they are the makers of the iPhone.
[00:13:31.960 --> 00:13:35.560]   They are completely, they get to make any choice they want to make about it.
[00:13:35.560 --> 00:13:39.480]   And that really will suffice when you start, I think when you start to complicate it by
[00:13:39.480 --> 00:13:43.440]   saying that, well, of course, removing it makes room for all these other things.
[00:13:43.440 --> 00:13:48.400]   Now my follow up question becomes, so you're saying that your engineers are not clever enough
[00:13:48.400 --> 00:13:52.000]   to figure out how to put in a haptic feedback device.
[00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:55.440]   Or you're saying that it's, or you're saying that it's physically impossible.
[00:13:55.440 --> 00:13:59.880]   I'm perfectly happy with the, with the explanation that we don't want to put a headphone jack
[00:13:59.880 --> 00:14:00.880]   in.
[00:14:00.880 --> 00:14:02.600]   Our priorities are completely elsewhere.
[00:14:02.600 --> 00:14:05.360]   And we're sorry, we know we'll give you some people, but this is the decision we want to
[00:14:05.360 --> 00:14:06.360]   make.
[00:14:06.360 --> 00:14:07.360]   Fine.
[00:14:07.360 --> 00:14:08.360]   You're done.
[00:14:08.360 --> 00:14:09.360]   You don't have to say anything else.
[00:14:09.360 --> 00:14:13.440]   So we've all given Phil Schiller's line.
[00:14:13.440 --> 00:14:14.440]   Courage.
[00:14:14.440 --> 00:14:15.440]   Courage.
[00:14:15.440 --> 00:14:16.440]   A hard time.
[00:14:16.440 --> 00:14:18.800]   It comes from Steve Jobs directly.
[00:14:18.800 --> 00:14:24.800]   This was an interview Steve gave at all things, D at the D conference some years ago, obviously,
[00:14:24.800 --> 00:14:26.140]   some years ago.
[00:14:26.140 --> 00:14:28.400]   It's a great longer piece, which I recommend.
[00:14:28.400 --> 00:14:32.320]   I'm not going to play the whole thing, but it's about why Apple chooses to put some things
[00:14:32.320 --> 00:14:33.320]   in or not.
[00:14:33.320 --> 00:14:34.320]   And this is what he said about courage.
[00:14:34.320 --> 00:14:37.200]   We're trying to make great products for people.
[00:14:37.200 --> 00:14:42.440]   And so we have at least the courage of our convictions to say, we don't think this is
[00:14:42.440 --> 00:14:43.960]   part of what makes a great product.
[00:14:43.960 --> 00:14:45.400]   We're going to leave it out.
[00:14:45.400 --> 00:14:47.200]   Some people are going to not like that.
[00:14:47.200 --> 00:14:48.600]   They're going to call us names.
[00:14:48.600 --> 00:14:51.840]   It's not going to be in certain companies vested interests that we do that, but we're
[00:14:51.840 --> 00:14:56.760]   going to take the heat because we want to make the best product in the world for customers.
[00:14:56.760 --> 00:15:00.680]   That's what Phil Schiller was thinking when he said courage.
[00:15:00.680 --> 00:15:02.840]   And maybe he should have had of our convictions.
[00:15:02.840 --> 00:15:03.840]   Yeah.
[00:15:03.840 --> 00:15:04.840]   It's an imprecise.
[00:15:04.840 --> 00:15:09.400]   Unfortunately, it's an imprecise word, and especially the week in which--
[00:15:09.400 --> 00:15:10.400]   Of 9/11.
[00:15:10.400 --> 00:15:11.400]   He was using it.
[00:15:11.400 --> 00:15:12.400]   Yeah.
[00:15:12.400 --> 00:15:14.360]   It was just bad timing.
[00:15:14.360 --> 00:15:16.200]   Courage of our convictions is different.
[00:15:16.200 --> 00:15:18.680]   And to be respected.
[00:15:18.680 --> 00:15:23.120]   And the willingness that Apple has to say, well, we might take a hit in the market because
[00:15:23.120 --> 00:15:26.600]   maybe consumers really want a headphone jack.
[00:15:26.600 --> 00:15:31.200]   Now, let's talk a little bit about it because I always love having somebody who's actually
[00:15:31.200 --> 00:15:34.200]   touched these products and used these products.
[00:15:34.200 --> 00:15:35.200]   And Renee, you have.
[00:15:35.200 --> 00:15:40.600]   I'm not imputing that you might have a review unit somewhere in your back pocket, but you
[00:15:40.600 --> 00:15:42.040]   were at the demo room.
[00:15:42.040 --> 00:15:44.640]   Yes, sir.
[00:15:44.640 --> 00:15:45.640]   One-- Okay.
[00:15:45.640 --> 00:15:50.400]   A couple of things come up for me.
[00:15:50.400 --> 00:15:54.800]   Thinking longer now about the AirPods, on the one hand, I'm excited about the Herable
[00:15:54.800 --> 00:15:55.800]   Revolution.
[00:15:55.800 --> 00:15:58.000]   And I think that's really where Apple's headed with this.
[00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:01.120]   The idea that it's more than just headphones.
[00:16:01.120 --> 00:16:04.080]   Even a beam forming microphone is pretty amazing.
[00:16:04.080 --> 00:16:10.280]   The idea of these could be heart rate monitors, step counters, even VO2 monitors and blood
[00:16:10.280 --> 00:16:13.440]   pressure monitors because they're in your ear, which is a really good place to put such
[00:16:13.440 --> 00:16:14.600]   a thing.
[00:16:14.600 --> 00:16:20.560]   And they can be, like Scarlett Johansson and her, Siri always available.
[00:16:20.560 --> 00:16:23.440]   And I think it's much better than in Google Glass or even a wristwatch in terms of a
[00:16:23.440 --> 00:16:24.880]   wearable.
[00:16:24.880 --> 00:16:28.000]   But that's not what we're getting with the AirPods yet.
[00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:29.000]   No.
[00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:34.440]   The AirPods or the Wearable is the Apple One is to, you know, an 5K iMac.
[00:16:34.440 --> 00:16:36.480]   I mean, this is the earliest days of all.
[00:16:36.480 --> 00:16:38.240]   Yeah, I mean, that's fair.
[00:16:38.240 --> 00:16:42.280]   Usually there's the early adoption phase and then it goes into the mainstream acceptance
[00:16:42.280 --> 00:16:43.280]   phase.
[00:16:43.280 --> 00:16:48.280]   And that's Apple One, Apple Two, the original iPhone, iPhone 3G, 3GS, iPad One, iPad Two.
[00:16:48.280 --> 00:16:51.160]   And what Apple wanted to do here is sort of take away the pain from Bluetooth because
[00:16:51.160 --> 00:16:55.480]   Bluetooth is a near magical technology that frustrates the bejesus out of all of us on
[00:16:55.480 --> 00:16:57.120]   almost a continual basis.
[00:16:57.120 --> 00:16:58.120]   It does.
[00:16:58.120 --> 00:17:03.320]   I mean, I wanted it's because I have not been really using Bluetooth audio phones.
[00:17:03.320 --> 00:17:09.320]   So I went out and bought the now obsolete Beats Two headphones.
[00:17:09.320 --> 00:17:12.960]   And I showed on yesterday and I was, today these things are impossible to pair.
[00:17:12.960 --> 00:17:17.680]   Once you pair them, they work fine, but they, but then you pair it and it's unpaired again
[00:17:17.680 --> 00:17:18.840]   and it's just they're tear.
[00:17:18.840 --> 00:17:19.840]   It's Bluetooth's awful.
[00:17:19.840 --> 00:17:20.840]   Yeah.
[00:17:20.840 --> 00:17:23.680]   And Apple started working around that with the new Mac accessories because you would just
[00:17:23.680 --> 00:17:27.000]   plug them into lightning and they would auto pair and from then on they would just work.
[00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:30.400]   But that was sort of like the iPad Pen pencil.
[00:17:30.400 --> 00:17:32.400]   Yeah, the pencil absolutely the same thing.
[00:17:32.400 --> 00:17:34.240]   And all this stuff is Bluetooth.
[00:17:34.240 --> 00:17:40.200]   So Bluetooth is a really established protocol and Bluetooth direct or Bluetooth low energy.
[00:17:40.200 --> 00:17:43.840]   It's sort of like a mix of two different radios that work really well together to do low power
[00:17:43.840 --> 00:17:47.080]   and high data because one of the things you want to do is race to sleep.
[00:17:47.080 --> 00:17:50.480]   If it takes you a long time to transmit, then the battery is always on and you waste a lot
[00:17:50.480 --> 00:17:51.480]   of power.
[00:17:51.480 --> 00:17:52.960]   But none of that has to do with the coupling.
[00:17:52.960 --> 00:17:55.480]   What Apple wanted to solve was the interactive part.
[00:17:55.480 --> 00:17:56.480]   So it's really cool.
[00:17:56.480 --> 00:17:59.640]   You get this little case and when you open up the case it begins to pair and then it takes
[00:17:59.640 --> 00:18:04.000]   over control center on your iPhone and it gives you this beautiful little interface.
[00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:06.560]   And it can actually if you pull one out, it shows you the one that you've pulled out,
[00:18:06.560 --> 00:18:07.560]   pull the other one out.
[00:18:07.560 --> 00:18:08.720]   It shows you that one.
[00:18:08.720 --> 00:18:12.560]   When you put it in your ear, if music is playing as soon as one ear pod is in your ear,
[00:18:12.560 --> 00:18:16.400]   it automatically shifts the audio and puts it into mono mode and feeds that into your
[00:18:16.400 --> 00:18:17.400]   one ear.
[00:18:17.400 --> 00:18:20.840]   When you put the other one in, it's puts it into stereo and starts feeding both of your
[00:18:20.840 --> 00:18:21.840]   ears.
[00:18:21.840 --> 00:18:24.960]   So you can either wear them both and get stereo or actually alternate one in the other and get
[00:18:24.960 --> 00:18:28.120]   really long battery life by doing mono.
[00:18:28.120 --> 00:18:29.120]   Oh, that's interesting.
[00:18:29.120 --> 00:18:30.120]   Mono switching.
[00:18:30.120 --> 00:18:31.880]   Five hours each, right?
[00:18:31.880 --> 00:18:33.800]   Totally and is charging in the case while you're wearing it.
[00:18:33.800 --> 00:18:35.800]   You actually get infinite battery in a way.
[00:18:35.800 --> 00:18:37.360]   Near infinite battery life.
[00:18:37.360 --> 00:18:38.360]   Yeah.
[00:18:38.360 --> 00:18:40.200]   But what about the ear slot?
[00:18:40.200 --> 00:18:42.080]   I'm not really crazy about the ear slot.
[00:18:42.080 --> 00:18:43.080]   Yeah.
[00:18:43.080 --> 00:18:44.080]   I mean, the extra.
[00:18:44.080 --> 00:18:47.800]   So one of the things here is that they externalize the antenna still because you're dealing with
[00:18:47.800 --> 00:18:50.920]   perception and humans are these ugly bags of mostly water.
[00:18:50.920 --> 00:18:51.920]   And if you ever use these.
[00:18:51.920 --> 00:18:52.920]   So that's not just a microphone.
[00:18:52.920 --> 00:18:53.920]   That's an antenna.
[00:18:53.920 --> 00:18:55.520]   I believe the entire array is in there.
[00:18:55.520 --> 00:18:58.720]   So you have the microphone, you have the antenna and you have the surface area which
[00:18:58.720 --> 00:19:01.440]   hopefully encourages the signal.
[00:19:01.440 --> 00:19:03.720]   You know, we're used to Bluetooth headsets with a microphone.
[00:19:03.720 --> 00:19:06.760]   Some have little boom jobbers and others have little boom mics there.
[00:19:06.760 --> 00:19:11.120]   But when you have a left hand right ear, it looks like you're attempting some sort of
[00:19:11.120 --> 00:19:12.120]   strange earring arrangement.
[00:19:12.120 --> 00:19:13.120]   It turns outside down.
[00:19:13.120 --> 00:19:14.280]   You look like an alien.
[00:19:14.280 --> 00:19:17.760]   And I really think that these are going to be a failure in the market.
[00:19:17.760 --> 00:19:20.880]   Of course, I'll be wrong because any but Apple fans will buy anything.
[00:19:20.880 --> 00:19:22.760]   Well, they didn't even use product and an early adoptee.
[00:19:22.760 --> 00:19:25.560]   I just think people are not going to want to rock around with your snot.
[00:19:25.560 --> 00:19:26.560]   I really don't.
[00:19:26.560 --> 00:19:29.120]   One thing like once you've had it up with your iPhone, it immediately is set up with
[00:19:29.120 --> 00:19:30.120]   your Apple Watch too.
[00:19:30.120 --> 00:19:32.760]   So if your Apple Watch starts playing music, it just switches.
[00:19:32.760 --> 00:19:35.400]   And then it uses iCloud to set up your iPad and your.
[00:19:35.400 --> 00:19:37.720]   Yeah, no, I get the benefit of it.
[00:19:37.720 --> 00:19:38.720]   Yeah.
[00:19:38.720 --> 00:19:41.120]   So that's supposed to happen with Bluetooth too.
[00:19:41.120 --> 00:19:44.800]   So we're going to we're going to have to wait for until all these shipped to actual
[00:19:44.800 --> 00:19:46.600]   consumers to see how well it actually works.
[00:19:46.600 --> 00:19:48.440]   I was reading a couple of different reviews this morning.
[00:19:48.440 --> 00:19:52.520]   Our Technica's reviewer had problems getting it to it was automatically switching between
[00:19:52.520 --> 00:19:53.840]   iOS devices.
[00:19:53.840 --> 00:19:59.080]   He had the Mac, he had the Mac OS beta installed and was told it was shit, should be working
[00:19:59.080 --> 00:20:01.360]   with switching to Mac, but it didn't.
[00:20:01.360 --> 00:20:04.240]   So the only solution was to repair it.
[00:20:04.240 --> 00:20:08.360]   And then after he repaired it, it was working with the Mac, but now wouldn't work with one
[00:20:08.360 --> 00:20:09.360]   oil.
[00:20:09.360 --> 00:20:10.360]   I was I was.
[00:20:10.360 --> 00:20:11.360]   They didn't have a Mac.
[00:20:11.360 --> 00:20:12.600]   They only showed it with iPhone iPad and watch.
[00:20:12.600 --> 00:20:13.600]   Right.
[00:20:13.600 --> 00:20:16.840]   And anyone who has ear pods right now has pre release hardware.
[00:20:16.840 --> 00:20:18.440]   So all this could change when we get there.
[00:20:18.440 --> 00:20:24.640]   But we have to realize that a friend of mine who writes about science every time someone
[00:20:24.640 --> 00:20:29.120]   tweets at her with this wonderful, this incredible science headline, her response is always the
[00:20:29.120 --> 00:20:30.120]   same.
[00:20:30.120 --> 00:20:31.120]   Interesting, if true.
[00:20:31.120 --> 00:20:32.120]   Yeah.
[00:20:32.120 --> 00:20:38.040]   So there were a lot of really great announcements that again, always with Apple announcements.
[00:20:38.040 --> 00:20:41.720]   Interesting if true is exactly the proof is in the pudding.
[00:20:41.720 --> 00:20:47.240]   So the idea of what I'm really interested in this new W chip they put into the devices
[00:20:47.240 --> 00:20:52.320]   themselves that make it compatible not just with basically it's Bluetooth, but then there's
[00:20:52.320 --> 00:20:57.920]   a secret there's a secret sauce in the device itself, not in the host hardware, which means
[00:20:57.920 --> 00:21:02.320]   that if you do spend $160 on these ear pods, you don't it's not as though you're throwing
[00:21:02.320 --> 00:21:04.640]   it away on something that could only work with Apple.
[00:21:04.640 --> 00:21:09.040]   It's just the super great Bluetooth, the super great auto pairing iCloud stuff only works
[00:21:09.040 --> 00:21:10.040]   with Apple devices.
[00:21:10.040 --> 00:21:14.800]   And of course, so we're going to have to wait because these aren't out to late next
[00:21:14.800 --> 00:21:15.800]   month.
[00:21:15.800 --> 00:21:16.800]   Right.
[00:21:16.800 --> 00:21:19.600]   So the device actually they're letting people have them and review them this early.
[00:21:19.600 --> 00:21:22.360]   It's actually telling part of the overall story that they told.
[00:21:22.360 --> 00:21:24.000]   So I think they had a one of them.
[00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:28.560]   I think the real story is we don't want really we don't want you to use a lightning port anymore
[00:21:28.560 --> 00:21:30.360]   than you want to use a lightning port for your headphones.
[00:21:30.360 --> 00:21:31.680]   We want you to go wireless.
[00:21:31.680 --> 00:21:32.680]   That's it.
[00:21:32.680 --> 00:21:39.920]   I like the fact that they are I didn't agree with some of what of how they decide to explain
[00:21:39.920 --> 00:21:44.320]   the lack of a headphone jack, but I like the indication here that they are humble.
[00:21:44.320 --> 00:21:49.040]   They realize that they do have to make that case and getting these ear pods in the hands
[00:21:49.040 --> 00:21:53.640]   of people so that while they're while early reviewers are we are talking about, well,
[00:21:53.640 --> 00:21:58.440]   of course, the of course on day two, I left my dongle in the wrong bag.
[00:21:58.440 --> 00:22:02.680]   So I couldn't use my usual daily $250 awesome saunheiser headphones.
[00:22:02.680 --> 00:22:03.920]   They could still in the same reviews.
[00:22:03.920 --> 00:22:08.000]   But if we have these really wonderful wireless headphones, it was actually quite nice.
[00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:09.000]   And here's how this work.
[00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:10.000]   Well, that's my thing.
[00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:13.520]   You're an idiot for for wanting our head.
[00:22:13.520 --> 00:22:17.000]   That's my other problem with the air pods is apparently it's exactly the same hardware
[00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:23.760]   as in the free ear pods that are going to come with the iPhone, which means they're
[00:22:23.760 --> 00:22:30.280]   not high-fi and Steve Kovac and others have said, yeah, these sound no better than your
[00:22:30.280 --> 00:22:31.280]   wire.
[00:22:31.280 --> 00:22:34.800]   I've read that there's an extra base port that actually works quite well.
[00:22:34.800 --> 00:22:35.800]   Okay.
[00:22:35.800 --> 00:22:38.160]   So I don't know if that's a hole that's been drilled and they can drill in the wire
[00:22:38.160 --> 00:22:44.920]   headphones, but and the problem is a lot of people reviewing them based on the moment
[00:22:44.920 --> 00:22:50.320]   momentary trial in the demo room, like the people who say you could ran around with
[00:22:50.320 --> 00:22:55.520]   them like, please, that is not a people people like people like Renee and people like me
[00:22:55.520 --> 00:22:58.040]   were too smart to we will say here.
[00:22:58.040 --> 00:23:01.440]   There's a picture of me in the demo room here and where is right?
[00:23:01.440 --> 00:23:05.940]   It's when it's when your your feed start filling up with first hands on review of new
[00:23:05.940 --> 00:23:06.940]   airport.
[00:23:06.940 --> 00:23:07.940]   No, it's not a review.
[00:23:07.940 --> 00:23:10.280]   It's a picture of yourself with a hundred of the people around you.
[00:23:10.280 --> 00:23:11.280]   No, Andy, I viewed it.
[00:23:11.280 --> 00:23:14.540]   And now I have a picture here to grab them out of your to get the next turn.
[00:23:14.540 --> 00:23:16.620]   What did they sound like Renee?
[00:23:16.620 --> 00:23:19.640]   It is so loud in those demo rooms that it's hard to hear over the din.
[00:23:19.640 --> 00:23:20.900]   I did hear it changing.
[00:23:20.900 --> 00:23:22.860]   I did hear it go from mono to stereo.
[00:23:22.860 --> 00:23:25.300]   So I heard it all working.
[00:23:25.300 --> 00:23:29.580]   I don't know if anybody's ever listed Apple earphones as top of the line audio for like
[00:23:29.580 --> 00:23:34.380]   here before anyway, but in 106, Apple is for some Apple sold them for a hundred sixty
[00:23:34.380 --> 00:23:35.380]   bucks.
[00:23:35.380 --> 00:23:36.380]   Well, that's wireless technology.
[00:23:36.380 --> 00:23:38.180]   It's like that, you know, that West Wing line.
[00:23:38.180 --> 00:23:40.140]   The first one is like a billion dollars.
[00:23:40.140 --> 00:23:41.300]   The second one is dollar fifty.
[00:23:41.300 --> 00:23:43.100]   So there's all the wireless technology in it.
[00:23:43.100 --> 00:23:46.780]   And then as that double you want to propagate, if it does propagate, we'll see them in beats.
[00:23:46.780 --> 00:23:50.300]   We'll see them in bows and we'll be able to choose which which piece of equipment we
[00:23:50.300 --> 00:23:52.620]   want and we'll hit the benefit of the easy.
[00:23:52.620 --> 00:23:57.180]   And Apple is not going to support app techs, which is an updated Bluetooth tech spec or
[00:23:57.180 --> 00:23:59.340]   are they for high five?
[00:23:59.340 --> 00:24:00.340]   It's hard.
[00:24:00.340 --> 00:24:02.100]   I mean, they're only talking about the soup that they use to make all these things.
[00:24:02.100 --> 00:24:04.020]   They just want you to see that it that it magically works.
[00:24:04.020 --> 00:24:07.300]   So my guess is if it provides significant advantage, they'll adopt it because they do
[00:24:07.300 --> 00:24:09.300]   make very heavy use of the Bluetooth.
[00:24:09.300 --> 00:24:11.700]   A number of Android phones already use app decks.
[00:24:11.700 --> 00:24:15.180]   I wouldn't be surprised if they supported in the future.
[00:24:15.180 --> 00:24:16.740]   Also we won't call an app techs.
[00:24:16.740 --> 00:24:18.700]   They'll call it Apple X or something.
[00:24:18.700 --> 00:24:24.060]   If it's something that can support via a via OS update or a firmware update or better
[00:24:24.060 --> 00:24:27.140]   get if it's something they get for free with the Bluetooth chip that they're buying and
[00:24:27.140 --> 00:24:31.060]   putting in the phone, they're not going to turn it off just to be jerks.
[00:24:31.060 --> 00:24:35.980]   So also worth pointing out that Apple has yet to confirm that they're going to license
[00:24:35.980 --> 00:24:38.580]   out the W one chip to other manufacturers.
[00:24:38.580 --> 00:24:39.580]   That's interesting.
[00:24:39.580 --> 00:24:42.980]   So it's possible that exclusive on that is possible.
[00:24:42.980 --> 00:24:47.260]   They're going to keep that as a secret sauce for beats and for Apple logo to hardware or
[00:24:47.260 --> 00:24:51.500]   it's possible that they're just being conservative in who they get to build it first because
[00:24:51.500 --> 00:24:53.380]   it's no good to put it in.
[00:24:53.380 --> 00:24:59.540]   It's no good to put it in really cheap, awful plastic headphones that are crap if they want
[00:24:59.540 --> 00:25:00.540]   to.
[00:25:00.540 --> 00:25:04.940]   If they want to promote it as this is part of the enhanced audio experience, it's possible
[00:25:04.940 --> 00:25:07.420]   they're going to want to only let people like Bose have it.
[00:25:07.420 --> 00:25:09.300]   People like the $300 headset makers have it.
[00:25:09.300 --> 00:25:13.500]   Must be software because Beatmaster and a chairman saying is Mac OS is supporting app
[00:25:13.500 --> 00:25:14.500]   decks now.
[00:25:14.500 --> 00:25:18.420]   So it must be a software only modification or a higher bit rate.
[00:25:18.420 --> 00:25:24.220]   I guess you need app decks headphones or an app decks device to take advantage of it.
[00:25:24.220 --> 00:25:27.660]   But it sounds like the Mac, current Macs can do it.
[00:25:27.660 --> 00:25:30.340]   So that's interesting.
[00:25:30.340 --> 00:25:36.220]   I would be a little less cynical if Apple hadn't, a couple of years ago spent $3 billion
[00:25:36.220 --> 00:25:39.700]   on a middling quality headphone company.
[00:25:39.700 --> 00:25:42.700]   This seems to be a very convenient way to make some of those money.
[00:25:42.700 --> 00:25:46.180]   It was a music streaming service that happened to have some of the apps.
[00:25:46.180 --> 00:25:47.740]   W1 headphones.
[00:25:47.740 --> 00:25:50.540]   Wow, they're just coming out now from being interesting.
[00:25:50.540 --> 00:25:54.860]   I think it's a great way to test that stuff internally because they by virtue of that
[00:25:54.860 --> 00:25:58.500]   company can now put these things in a wide variety of heads as they never manufacture
[00:25:58.500 --> 00:26:00.700]   on their own and test them.
[00:26:00.700 --> 00:26:02.340]   It's super interesting to me that Apple is releasing their first.
[00:26:02.340 --> 00:26:04.860]   One man synergy is another man's profit.
[00:26:04.860 --> 00:26:10.820]   Totally, but I mean like Apple hasn't made a radio or a pairing chip before and you look
[00:26:10.820 --> 00:26:17.940]   at W1 and you look at A1 and M10 and M10 and suddenly the SS2 chip suddenly Apple's starting
[00:26:17.940 --> 00:26:22.380]   to get an alphabet full of silicon and it makes you really wonder what's up next.
[00:26:22.380 --> 00:26:26.660]   The photo sensor, the screen, the modem and the phones.
[00:26:26.660 --> 00:26:28.500]   It's a super interesting time.
[00:26:28.500 --> 00:26:31.980]   I mean this year they switched to Intel for some of their modem so they don't support
[00:26:31.980 --> 00:26:32.980]   CDMA carrier.
[00:26:32.980 --> 00:26:33.980]   I saw that was interesting.
[00:26:33.980 --> 00:26:35.420]   Yeah, is that the first time they've done that?
[00:26:35.420 --> 00:26:45.420]   So if you get an Apple iPhone 7 from T-Mobile or AT&T GSM carriers you will not have a
[00:26:45.420 --> 00:26:47.100]   CDMA radio in there.
[00:26:47.100 --> 00:26:50.580]   It's a dirty little secret that Qualcomm charges exorbitantly.
[00:26:50.580 --> 00:26:55.100]   I've heard that it is double digit percentage of retail for the licensing fee for CDMA and
[00:26:55.100 --> 00:26:58.580]   that Verizon and Sprint in the US are the only places that still use it but they're in such
[00:26:58.580 --> 00:26:59.940]   a critical market.
[00:26:59.940 --> 00:27:05.020]   Sort of keeps the entire industry behind or forces competency forces compatibility with
[00:27:05.020 --> 00:27:06.220]   the entire industry.
[00:27:06.220 --> 00:27:10.420]   So I think everyone is hoping they move away from it and this is a good way for Apple to
[00:27:10.420 --> 00:27:13.980]   save that licensing fee on a huge number of their phones.
[00:27:13.980 --> 00:27:19.140]   My traditional choice and I did it this year for an unlocked iPhone is to get it from T-Mobile
[00:27:19.140 --> 00:27:20.940]   but that's probably a mistake this year.
[00:27:20.940 --> 00:27:25.380]   You should get it from Verizon because then you'll get the CDMA radio and an unlocked
[00:27:25.380 --> 00:27:26.380]   LTE.
[00:27:26.380 --> 00:27:31.180]   Yeah, if you think you'll ever use it on CDMA and most of the world is not a world.
[00:27:31.180 --> 00:27:32.180]   Right.
[00:27:32.180 --> 00:27:38.020]   So for US users where we're, you know, I think even, I'm sure of it, even Verizon and Sprint
[00:27:38.020 --> 00:27:41.340]   are using LTE now for most of the time.
[00:27:41.340 --> 00:27:45.260]   And increasingly voiceover LTE which sort of liberates us all finally.
[00:27:45.260 --> 00:27:46.260]   Right.
[00:27:46.260 --> 00:27:49.500]   So you need CDMA and that increasingly.
[00:27:49.500 --> 00:27:55.260]   But I will say that if you do get a phone from Verizon you will have both radios, you
[00:27:55.260 --> 00:28:00.380]   will have a SIM slot which means if you travel with it you will be able to use a local network.
[00:28:00.380 --> 00:28:05.140]   So every time you switch phones it's a good time to think about switching carriers because
[00:28:05.140 --> 00:28:06.620]   it's still cutthroat business.
[00:28:06.620 --> 00:28:11.180]   Verizon might give you an incredible deal that you cannot get if you simply renew whatever
[00:28:11.180 --> 00:28:14.980]   contract you have and remember if you still buy the phone through Verizon it's not as
[00:28:14.980 --> 00:28:19.420]   so you can't take that phone with you after your contract is over and take it someplace
[00:28:19.420 --> 00:28:20.420]   else.
[00:28:20.420 --> 00:28:25.140]   It's not as though the Verizon phone will be less valuable to the secondary resale market
[00:28:25.140 --> 00:28:28.780]   when you go through Gizala or go through any other secondary seller afterwards.
[00:28:28.780 --> 00:28:31.060]   So just something to think about.
[00:28:31.060 --> 00:28:37.940]   One of our chatters, Web 1702 is asking if, and maybe you guys know this, you'll be able
[00:28:37.940 --> 00:28:44.780]   to buy a truly unlocked SIM free phone come this Friday.
[00:28:44.780 --> 00:28:46.980]   In the US traditionally they haven't done the main.
[00:28:46.980 --> 00:28:47.980]   They wait, usually they wait.
[00:28:47.980 --> 00:28:48.980]   Yeah.
[00:28:48.980 --> 00:28:50.340]   That's one of the four carriers.
[00:28:50.340 --> 00:28:55.860]   But the T-Mobile phone is essentially that minus the SIM on the radio.
[00:28:55.860 --> 00:28:56.860]   Yes, I'm unlocked.
[00:28:56.860 --> 00:29:00.940]   I don't like to use it locally and T-Mobile is effectively all of them are unlocked but
[00:29:00.940 --> 00:29:03.500]   when you put in this SIM they lock them to the carrier with the SIM.
[00:29:03.500 --> 00:29:04.500]   Oh, okay.
[00:29:04.500 --> 00:29:08.940]   So for instance I couldn't get the phone on a phone, any phone on the 16th and I need
[00:29:08.940 --> 00:29:11.980]   one so we can talk about it on the weekend and so forth and I'd like to take it on my
[00:29:11.980 --> 00:29:12.980]   trip with me.
[00:29:12.980 --> 00:29:18.660]   So I ended up buying it through on Apple but as an AT&T customer and they very much verify
[00:29:18.660 --> 00:29:21.260]   that I was an AT&T customer.
[00:29:21.260 --> 00:29:24.820]   But are you saying that if I don't put a SIM in that AT&T phone, if I put a T-Mobile
[00:29:24.820 --> 00:29:28.020]   SIM in it right away, I'll be able to use it?
[00:29:28.020 --> 00:29:29.020]   I would be nice.
[00:29:29.020 --> 00:29:31.380]   I don't want to say that with confidence because I have not personally tried.
[00:29:31.380 --> 00:29:32.380]   Nobody knows.
[00:29:32.380 --> 00:29:35.460]   I mean people were desperate after the event to figure out all these things.
[00:29:35.460 --> 00:29:38.580]   And the T-Mobile one as you said, the T-Mobile one is almost always some unlocked and the
[00:29:38.580 --> 00:29:39.580]   reason one is GSM.
[00:29:39.580 --> 00:29:42.940]   I'm going to get the jet black but it won't come till after I get back from my trip.
[00:29:42.940 --> 00:29:43.940]   It comes October 4th.
[00:29:43.940 --> 00:29:45.660]   Boy, and I'm glad I ordered it.
[00:29:45.660 --> 00:29:50.460]   I got on it right as soon as it opened and jet black was already sold out.
[00:29:50.460 --> 00:29:51.460]   Do you think they had them?
[00:29:51.460 --> 00:29:54.060]   I bought them the matte one first and then I went to buy the jet black one and it was
[00:29:54.060 --> 00:29:55.060]   November.
[00:29:55.060 --> 00:29:56.780]   It was back a week or two weeks.
[00:29:56.780 --> 00:29:59.860]   Do you think they had any jet blacks for Friday?
[00:29:59.860 --> 00:30:00.860]   They did.
[00:30:00.860 --> 00:30:03.380]   It was a hard, it's a very hard process.
[00:30:03.380 --> 00:30:07.140]   I forget what these seven takes and it's an 18 hours something to make.
[00:30:07.140 --> 00:30:11.020]   So they're fewer than because it's just not only that but you also have to think about
[00:30:11.020 --> 00:30:14.940]   what the reject rate is that it's not just the time it takes to build one but how many
[00:30:14.940 --> 00:30:17.020]   do they have to build to get the one that they put in the box?
[00:30:17.020 --> 00:30:20.460]   And of course the new colors are always the ones in greatest demand because everybody
[00:30:20.460 --> 00:30:22.620]   wants to show off that they have the new iPhone.
[00:30:22.620 --> 00:30:26.460]   I ordered the new colors because I want to be able to say to you, oh it's scratched or
[00:30:26.460 --> 00:30:29.740]   not or this is what it looks like.
[00:30:29.740 --> 00:30:35.100]   So anyway I got a gold one which is two years ago, new color.
[00:30:35.100 --> 00:30:37.900]   But at least I'll have the new camera and I'll be able to take it on the trip.
[00:30:37.900 --> 00:30:39.380]   So I'll get that on Friday.
[00:30:39.380 --> 00:30:43.660]   And I was really hoping to get it at the new Apple watch before I left but it looks like
[00:30:43.660 --> 00:30:46.100]   which one Leo.
[00:30:46.100 --> 00:30:49.060]   It's actually embarrassing to admit.
[00:30:49.060 --> 00:30:50.700]   I wanted the ceramic one so I ordered.
[00:30:50.700 --> 00:30:53.100]   I know I ordered that and then my boss took it from me.
[00:30:53.100 --> 00:30:55.140]   You got the Herb Tarlek model.
[00:30:55.140 --> 00:30:58.940]   I so I ordered it and he said you know Renee you're so busy with this iPhone review I could
[00:30:58.940 --> 00:31:03.500]   really do this review for you and by the way is he getting his on Friday?
[00:31:03.500 --> 00:31:04.580]   Yes.
[00:31:04.580 --> 00:31:06.460]   Because I ordered it at the crack of midnight.
[00:31:06.460 --> 00:31:10.180]   I should have started with the watch because I'm not getting mine September 23rd a week
[00:31:10.180 --> 00:31:11.180]   later.
[00:31:11.180 --> 00:31:12.180]   And I'm of course not even here.
[00:31:12.180 --> 00:31:14.220]   Yes, three of the ceramic watches and he wants to measure it against.
[00:31:14.220 --> 00:31:18.460]   I just I like I've had ceramic wrist you know traditional wish watches before and I've
[00:31:18.460 --> 00:31:19.460]   always liked it.
[00:31:19.460 --> 00:31:21.780]   I've always had black ones.
[00:31:21.780 --> 00:31:26.020]   White is a strange choice although it's kind of a Johnny I've looked so good.
[00:31:26.020 --> 00:31:27.020]   Yeah.
[00:31:27.020 --> 00:31:31.860]   Well you know what I did I ordered because it comes this $1,300 watch comes with a plastic
[00:31:31.860 --> 00:31:33.860]   band.
[00:31:33.860 --> 00:31:34.860]   White plastic band.
[00:31:34.860 --> 00:31:37.580]   So I went out and I ordered cheapest edition ever.
[00:31:37.580 --> 00:31:43.460]   So I ordered and of course they came to to tantalize me.
[00:31:43.460 --> 00:31:46.060]   I ordered so tell me if now you're the band guy.
[00:31:46.060 --> 00:31:47.060]   Yes sir.
[00:31:47.060 --> 00:31:48.060]   So I have no experience.
[00:31:48.060 --> 00:31:52.260]   Well I've been using the same band on my Apple watch that came with it to hand some
[00:31:52.260 --> 00:31:53.260]   band.
[00:31:53.260 --> 00:31:56.660]   So I got the I thought if it's gonna be a white watch I'm not gonna wear a white band.
[00:31:56.660 --> 00:31:58.660]   So I got this is the Navy.
[00:31:58.660 --> 00:32:01.500]   Yeah, that's a comfortable band.
[00:32:01.500 --> 00:32:05.620]   I'm gonna wear a leather band and then I thought I'd be.
[00:32:05.620 --> 00:32:07.820]   I wanted to get pink.
[00:32:07.820 --> 00:32:08.820]   I thought pink and white.
[00:32:08.820 --> 00:32:12.060]   Now there's a there's a man who's confident in sexuality.
[00:32:12.060 --> 00:32:13.060]   The black Milanese too.
[00:32:13.060 --> 00:32:14.060]   It's very cool.
[00:32:14.060 --> 00:32:15.060]   Black Milanese.
[00:32:15.060 --> 00:32:16.660]   I'm not even trying to be funny here.
[00:32:16.660 --> 00:32:20.820]   Isn't that kind of weird that they they should they should announce this the ceramic
[00:32:20.820 --> 00:32:25.740]   one the white ceramic one like in spring because this is it's such a spring and summer color.
[00:32:25.740 --> 00:32:27.660]   I can't wear a white watch after late day Andy.
[00:32:27.660 --> 00:32:31.460]   I know I know it's it's hard to say that without sounding like I'm just making a stupid
[00:32:31.460 --> 00:32:37.500]   look like it feels like I'm serious like every but I am serious though that every time I
[00:32:37.500 --> 00:32:41.380]   see that I think it was harp tarlick with the white shoes and the white belt.
[00:32:41.380 --> 00:32:42.780]   I got the would have the white.
[00:32:42.780 --> 00:32:44.740]   I thought this would look good too.
[00:32:44.740 --> 00:32:48.340]   Crockett where the I got the nylon black and gray nylon.
[00:32:48.340 --> 00:32:50.100]   That should look nice with white right.
[00:32:50.100 --> 00:32:51.100]   That's it.
[00:32:51.100 --> 00:32:52.100]   That's really well.
[00:32:52.100 --> 00:32:55.820]   A lot of dark contrasting colors will look great with that's what I thought.
[00:32:55.820 --> 00:33:00.020]   White on white with a floral elastomer band I for thirteen hundred bucks they could have
[00:33:00.020 --> 00:33:03.460]   given you a nicer couple years ago he's no longer with Apple but a couple years ago
[00:33:03.460 --> 00:33:07.100]   they had a very British gentleman at the watch table sort of suggesting pairings.
[00:33:07.100 --> 00:33:08.100]   Oh how lovely.
[00:33:08.100 --> 00:33:11.100]   This is amazing just the pink would look smashing.
[00:33:11.100 --> 00:33:12.100]   Smashing.
[00:33:12.100 --> 00:33:16.220]   The most elegant thing I think that's when they were hardcore to the fashion stuff.
[00:33:16.220 --> 00:33:20.740]   I do I do find it kind of odd it is it is in that category of things that I'm not my
[00:33:20.740 --> 00:33:25.540]   head is not really wired up to understand to me it's to me it's a white watch if it were
[00:33:25.540 --> 00:33:29.660]   white metal it would be a white watch if it were white plastic it would be a white watch.
[00:33:29.660 --> 00:33:36.340]   I've I haven't held one in my hand I've seen really good pictures of it at this point.
[00:33:36.340 --> 00:33:40.940]   It's a white watch it doesn't look special ceramic is a really neat material because
[00:33:40.940 --> 00:33:47.100]   it's white and harder than steel and so and it has a unique look and it's it looks brand
[00:33:47.100 --> 00:33:53.780]   new even as it ages it doesn't age it looks it's like so I love my black ceramic watch
[00:33:53.780 --> 00:33:59.380]   I miss it because it felt the ceramic didn't die the the watch got died.
[00:33:59.380 --> 00:34:02.780]   I should just wear the band with a hole.
[00:34:02.780 --> 00:34:08.260]   What do you think about the people maybe no maybe this was a small number who bought
[00:34:08.260 --> 00:34:13.700]   a ten thousand dollar gold edition last time and have no upgrade path whatsoever.
[00:34:13.700 --> 00:34:17.660]   I asked someone about this it was the funniest answer ever and this this was not from someone
[00:34:17.660 --> 00:34:20.180]   directly affiliated with Apple but it was someone who was in that industry and he's
[00:34:20.180 --> 00:34:23.800]   like they bought a twenty thousand dollar dress that they only wore once they spent
[00:34:23.800 --> 00:34:27.540]   twenty thousand dollars on a ticket to United Arab Emirates they spot a hotel room that
[00:34:27.540 --> 00:34:31.540]   was six stars for for two nights and they bought three of those watches and put them
[00:34:31.540 --> 00:34:36.580]   on the legs of their dogs they have not thought about those watches in eleven months mostly.
[00:34:36.580 --> 00:34:41.540]   Yeah that that that was always my problem with that product is even for well wasn't
[00:34:41.540 --> 00:34:46.820]   wearing it when he got in the car for carpool karaoke you haven't we know he had one.
[00:34:46.820 --> 00:34:51.580]   Yeah you never saw one in the wrist of an apple executive it's kind of embarrassing
[00:34:51.580 --> 00:34:56.300]   yeah I'm sorry that the fact that it exists is kind of embarrassing enough that the not
[00:34:56.300 --> 00:34:59.780]   that the they're not wearing them as embarrassing embarrassing the story was that Johnny wanted
[00:34:59.780 --> 00:35:03.260]   to work with gold this was the one apple product that could maybe get away with it because he
[00:35:03.260 --> 00:35:08.020]   just loves materials so that Johnny oh that you know that well I mean like you got eight
[00:35:08.020 --> 00:35:13.660]   gold black pencil awards here allowed to experiment with yeah so I think Sir Amick what
[00:35:13.660 --> 00:35:18.660]   he only got to make interiors I'm this is what Johnny I said here years his Bergman movie
[00:35:18.660 --> 00:35:25.060]   I'm I'm very tempted to hit this thing with a hammer but at the time at least let me borrow
[00:35:25.060 --> 00:35:31.340]   it for a week before you have the cost $17,000 really just get a get Patrick Norton to come
[00:35:31.340 --> 00:35:36.300]   up with his ledge hammer and say Patrick honestly think this is the finest watch smashing hammer
[00:35:36.300 --> 00:35:44.060]   I said a sort of hammer you have a short video to explain about how we made this hammer impact
[00:35:44.060 --> 00:35:49.420]   yeah anyway I wish apple had done black ceramic instead of white ceramic but I but I'm looking
[00:35:49.420 --> 00:35:54.140]   forward to seeing it and I think it'll go very nicely with my jet black my piano black
[00:35:54.140 --> 00:36:01.940]   I love cheese so at the same time I think part of the reason I'm so touchy about apple is
[00:36:01.940 --> 00:36:07.860]   because I spent like $3,000 so much but now you look like the Imperial Army from car wars
[00:36:07.860 --> 00:36:13.460]   you know super and the Vader because I had to buy it not just for me but for people here
[00:36:13.460 --> 00:36:18.040]   work so they can review you know because I buy review units instead of getting it from
[00:36:18.040 --> 00:36:22.540]   apple so they're all you know they're all sport and new my bill after the two phones
[00:36:22.540 --> 00:36:29.860]   in the watch made me almost cry well the good news is I I had a little stake from Samsung
[00:36:29.860 --> 00:36:39.140]   because I turned in the note seven so I it was like a credit you know 850 smackers and
[00:36:39.140 --> 00:36:47.300]   I wasn't going to do it because I knew that mine was made in China and I had fairly strong
[00:36:47.300 --> 00:36:53.140]   confidence that the ones made in China had the Chinese battery not this the Samsung affiliate
[00:36:53.140 --> 00:37:00.100]   made battery that's been causing all the problems but would you keep a note seven oh no why
[00:37:00.100 --> 00:37:04.100]   especially since the airlines are now saying if you have a note seven do not put it in your
[00:37:04.100 --> 00:37:08.100]   checked luggage do not turn it on and do not charge it on the plane so I'm going to about
[00:37:08.100 --> 00:37:13.380]   to go on some really long flights and then I'll have to charge it on the boat and I don't
[00:37:13.380 --> 00:37:17.220]   want to be the guy who burned a boat to the police bulletin saying it's not just Samsung
[00:37:17.220 --> 00:37:21.860]   don't sleep with any phone don't put any phone you know that's I mean the truth somebody I mean
[00:37:21.860 --> 00:37:27.060]   somebody I think at this point by the way take with a grain of salt any story you read about a
[00:37:27.060 --> 00:37:32.660]   galaxy phone blowing up in somebody's hand because at this point we're in their Jeep or
[00:37:32.660 --> 00:37:37.220]   whatever because at this point I think people are going to start saying oh yeah it blew up on me
[00:37:37.220 --> 00:37:40.820]   but it's like a clean extra phone combust is going to be people are going to just see him
[00:37:40.820 --> 00:37:46.580]   miss that one yeah well that's that's that's a real issue though uh but I think Samsung should
[00:37:46.580 --> 00:37:51.780]   get some flak for making it a voluntary recall as opposed to doing it through the government
[00:37:51.780 --> 00:37:57.060]   well they're working with the CPSC they say that they're really a compulsory recall are they working
[00:37:57.060 --> 00:38:01.780]   with them yes is it an official government recall yeah it would not yet it's going to be
[00:38:01.780 --> 00:38:05.060]   there because the wilder get that going I guess the difference between the but
[00:38:05.060 --> 00:38:09.380]   voluntary and doing it through the government is that and now makes it illegal to sell any of
[00:38:09.380 --> 00:38:13.460]   this stock and that's was that's very very important Samsung is also apparently pushing out an
[00:38:13.460 --> 00:38:18.420]   update that keeps you from charging your phone past 60 percent I really actually applaud
[00:38:18.420 --> 00:38:22.180]   the way Samsung's doing this they're taking them all all two and a half million back
[00:38:22.180 --> 00:38:26.660]   it's going to cost them more than a billion dollars in loss um it's the timing couldn't be
[00:38:26.660 --> 00:38:31.540]   worse because it happened it's a nightmare scenario for a manufacturer apples new phone came out at
[00:38:31.540 --> 00:38:39.220]   a very similar cost um it hurts their reputation uh and I agree Andy they could have even gone
[00:38:39.220 --> 00:38:43.940]   farther and gone straight to the CPSC they probably should have um nevertheless I think they're you
[00:38:43.940 --> 00:38:48.260]   know they're giving people a 25 dollar credit they're doing as much as uh reasonably could be
[00:38:48.260 --> 00:38:53.700]   expected yeah and and a lot of the at least in the US a lot of the uh sellers are even going beyond
[00:38:53.700 --> 00:38:57.860]   that yes they're not just saying we will swap you with a new one it's like no we'll give you a full
[00:38:57.860 --> 00:39:02.340]   refund that you can apply to any phone we have or we will actually refund your money we will not
[00:39:02.340 --> 00:39:06.900]   charge you no that's exactly what I got I got I got my every penny back except for the seven
[00:39:06.900 --> 00:39:12.020]   dollars and 99 cents I paid for a plastic case I think there was some concern about people who
[00:39:12.020 --> 00:39:15.220]   bought them second hand you know from people who bought a couple of them and sold them on eBay or
[00:39:15.220 --> 00:39:19.220]   Craigslist or something I think they've been pretty good though if you bring the phone in they just
[00:39:19.220 --> 00:39:24.340]   you know they they want them off the market it's very clear yeah well that's they don't want to
[00:39:24.340 --> 00:39:30.420]   have to pay for hotel rooms and yeah and apartment buildings yeah because it has it's not it's not
[00:39:31.220 --> 00:39:35.380]   conjectural these things have been happening could not be worth timing could not be could not be
[00:39:35.380 --> 00:39:42.260]   was especially it's it's actually going to be hard to now evaluate uh success or it's going to be
[00:39:42.260 --> 00:39:48.820]   impact our interpretation of how well the iPhone 7 and 7 plus sell because now you're dealing with
[00:39:48.820 --> 00:39:54.420]   people who uh not and in the next time they do uh apple says how many people are switched from
[00:39:54.420 --> 00:39:59.860]   Android because now we have people thousands if not hundreds of thousands of people in America who
[00:39:59.860 --> 00:40:05.380]   have eight hundred and some odd dollars in their hand that they did not that they thought that they
[00:40:05.380 --> 00:40:10.980]   had spent that they had spent on their uh on their uh a Samsung phone that now they can apply to anything
[00:40:10.980 --> 00:40:16.180]   and maybe this is going to be the thing that gets people to try the iPhone again if they switched
[00:40:16.180 --> 00:40:21.220]   a few years ago or if they've always kind of wanted an iPhone and they've let's say they've
[00:40:21.220 --> 00:40:27.540]   always been in the Samsung camp obviously the idea of a battery spontaneously igniting is enough to
[00:40:27.540 --> 00:40:31.460]   make you think well I'm going to now look really hard at alternatives and with special with the
[00:40:31.460 --> 00:40:36.580]   iPhone 7 they might very much like what they see according to the friend and 50 percent of their
[00:40:36.580 --> 00:40:40.980]   readers are not going to get another note seven they're going to get an iPhone instead I had a
[00:40:40.980 --> 00:40:44.740]   friend who anytime there was anything wrong with a plane you would immediately book a vacation
[00:40:44.740 --> 00:40:48.340]   because you knew everybody else would cancel so the humans are either they're either going to
[00:40:48.340 --> 00:40:51.540]   never buy a Samsung phone again or at least not for a while or they're going to immediately buy
[00:40:51.540 --> 00:40:56.180]   them because they figured now it's going to be the safest time ever to buy them it's I mean sad
[00:40:56.180 --> 00:41:02.980]   because it's it really was a great phone and they did a very good job uh I think of uh answering
[00:41:02.980 --> 00:41:09.220]   people's complaints about the previous version and making them I was looking at this quote because
[00:41:09.220 --> 00:41:15.620]   uh the uh uh the head of Samsung smartphone business Kodongjin uh there was a press conference on
[00:41:15.620 --> 00:41:20.740]   Friday and he was asked like how much is this going to cost the phone division and the quote is
[00:41:20.740 --> 00:41:26.020]   it's a heartbreaking amount of money oh I'm sure it's not going to it's not going to affect Samsung's
[00:41:26.020 --> 00:41:30.020]   bottom line because the phone businesses like less than five percent of their entire business
[00:41:30.020 --> 00:41:34.740]   but yeah this is this is a huge huge hit yeah yeah yeah let's take a break I there's so much more
[00:41:34.740 --> 00:41:38.660]   to talk about we're just kind of screched scraping the surface like then your phones we haven't
[00:41:38.660 --> 00:41:43.540]   talked about them yet I know and we're just dipping in here but uh and I haven't even mentioned the
[00:41:43.540 --> 00:41:46.500]   then I mean I can't wait to take my watch in the water and make it
[00:41:46.500 --> 00:41:51.220]   oh I do have some breaking news for you Leo the apples gave me a statement on there's some people
[00:41:51.220 --> 00:41:55.300]   are having some problems with OTA updates for iOS 10 is pushing them into recovery mode that's what
[00:41:55.300 --> 00:42:00.020]   I want to talk about okay so we have a statement from so there's some issues going on iOS 10 comes
[00:42:00.020 --> 00:42:06.740]   out today and already uh lots of stories about major issues when we come back we will talk about
[00:42:07.300 --> 00:42:14.100]   that Renee is in the know so just hang on for a second uh and maybe hold off should Renee just
[00:42:14.100 --> 00:42:18.260]   before we go to the commercial should they hold off no they said that the problem occurred in the
[00:42:18.260 --> 00:42:22.820]   first hour of release so it's been fixed by now so if you haven't tried yet you're good okay and I
[00:42:22.820 --> 00:42:28.500]   actually because I was on the beta ring as I but I'm sure both of you were we've had the release
[00:42:28.500 --> 00:42:32.500]   iOS 10 for several days now and it's worked for the same build numbers so nothing to change yeah it's
[00:42:32.500 --> 00:42:39.620]   fine um anyway our show today brought to you by Drobo oh I am loving so I have a Drobo mini
[00:42:39.620 --> 00:42:45.060]   and I loaded it up with the Drobo mini is so cool because it's very lightweight and portable
[00:42:45.060 --> 00:42:49.300]   the ideas photographers might take it with them though Drobo all the Drobo's do kind of
[00:42:49.300 --> 00:42:53.940]   this great thing which is they're they hold multiple discs the mini can hold four different
[00:42:53.940 --> 00:42:59.940]   discs I have four SSDs in there three terabyte three terabyte two terabyte two terabyte so 10
[00:42:59.940 --> 00:43:07.460]   terabytes and it does this kind of uh they call it uh beyond raid where it makes one massive
[00:43:07.460 --> 00:43:13.300]   disc with redundancy any one drive can fail you pop it out put a new one in hot swap without even
[00:43:13.300 --> 00:43:18.580]   turning the machine off and it'll rebuild and so I've got data integrity and having all that storage
[00:43:18.580 --> 00:43:25.300]   is so awesome it's my it's my data drive now um let's let me talk in general about Drobo
[00:43:26.180 --> 00:43:31.540]   and actually started I didn't know this when his the founder uh lost his honeymoon photos
[00:43:31.540 --> 00:43:38.020]   uh to do to a hard drive crash and he had a raid array and he said well what's what got his
[00:43:38.020 --> 00:43:44.260]   raid it's supposed to fix this so he created beyond raid and the Drobo's and we've had Drobo's
[00:43:44.260 --> 00:43:51.620]   since they started years ago some really great models out there beyond raid does a lot of things
[00:43:51.620 --> 00:43:57.220]   differently from raid has the same kind of you know preserve your data redundancy but the drives
[00:43:57.220 --> 00:44:01.140]   don't have to be heterogeneous forever for instance so you can just take whatever drives you've got
[00:44:01.140 --> 00:44:06.100]   lying around and that's what I did put them in and unlike raid which will say okay the smallest
[00:44:06.100 --> 00:44:11.940]   drive that's the toe you know that's the the biggest of any of these drives can be um you don't
[00:44:11.940 --> 00:44:17.940]   have to worry about data corruption and power outages you can easily add capacity to live storage if
[00:44:17.940 --> 00:44:22.900]   used you have an all of the front panels are so cool they're magnetic easily removed and they have
[00:44:22.900 --> 00:44:27.940]   lights on them to tell you everything like if you're running out which drive is getting low you
[00:44:27.940 --> 00:44:32.820]   could pop that smallest drive or the drive that's getting full and just put another one in without
[00:44:32.820 --> 00:44:38.580]   turning anything off it'll rebuild and you've suddenly got more capacity they have a battery
[00:44:38.580 --> 00:44:42.980]   backed cache so you're not going to get right failure or data corruption for in a power outage
[00:44:43.620 --> 00:44:52.660]   I really love many of the drobos now have the ability to put in a m.2 SSD card in there to
[00:44:52.660 --> 00:45:00.260]   cache rights and even a 64 gig a small inexpensive one speeds up small file reads and writes but
[00:45:00.260 --> 00:45:07.540]   it's so awesome this thing is lightning fast drobo offers models with four to 12 drive bays up to 64
[00:45:07.540 --> 00:45:13.460]   terabytes of protected storage connects directly to a Mac of course or a pc they have thunder
[00:45:13.460 --> 00:45:20.660]   bolt they have USB 3 they have network attached so I also have a 5n which is a fully ethernet network
[00:45:20.660 --> 00:45:24.820]   attached storage system they also make the 810 and if you really want to go crazy that's the
[00:45:24.820 --> 00:45:35.060]   that's the 5 has a 5 drive bays of course the 810 has an uncountable number i think it's 8
[00:45:36.180 --> 00:45:43.780]   see all those lights going across is a ton of them and and the like any a great system you can
[00:45:43.780 --> 00:45:48.660]   extend it with Drobo apps they're free and installed from the dashboard the Drobo Dashboard is awesome
[00:45:48.660 --> 00:45:53.380]   if you're getting a new iPhone 7 you maybe you're getting the 256 gig model maybe you're going to
[00:45:53.380 --> 00:45:58.900]   shoot 4k video the Drobo Pics app works with your phone to automatically backup your photos and
[00:45:58.900 --> 00:46:06.020]   videos and get this in full uncompressed quality once you get on your home Wi-Fi it you know I
[00:46:06.020 --> 00:46:12.020]   of course I have iCloud photo storage but I also want a second copy you know three copies of
[00:46:12.020 --> 00:46:16.420]   everything right and I love it that my Drobo just when I get in the house boom it's backing up to
[00:46:16.420 --> 00:46:24.020]   the Drobo I have I you know I had a terabyte external drive on my 5k iMac and I had to do a lot
[00:46:24.020 --> 00:46:29.140]   of you know hygiene like oh I can't put my home music collection on it or you know stuff like that
[00:46:29.140 --> 00:46:36.260]   and now because I have the the Drobo on my hard drive as my main drive I just completed a project
[00:46:36.260 --> 00:46:41.780]   it took me about a week and a half of downloading every audible book I've ever purchased so I have
[00:46:41.780 --> 00:46:46.580]   a local copy so because I can go back and listen to a book and I was thinking for this trip I might
[00:46:46.580 --> 00:46:55.300]   run you know put some of the classics on my new 256 gig iPhone Drobo go to the Drobo store and
[00:46:55.300 --> 00:47:01.220]   find out more in fact you could save a hundred bucks off their purchase of select Drobo models
[00:47:01.220 --> 00:47:07.060]   including the Drobo 5 and the one I'm just put in my network drive at Drobo store.com use a code
[00:47:07.060 --> 00:47:14.420]   TW 100 DWIT 100 for a hundred dollars off your purchase of select models and we thank Drobo
[00:47:14.420 --> 00:47:18.580]   not only for their support but and they've been an advertiser for a long time but also for
[00:47:18.580 --> 00:47:23.940]   really making the best products out there I Drobo is one one product I never have
[00:47:23.940 --> 00:47:28.180]   trouble spending my money on because I just it's like so critical to everything.
[00:47:28.180 --> 00:47:32.980]   All right so you have a statement from Apple on this so first of all what was happening Renee
[00:47:32.980 --> 00:47:37.140]   with iOS 10? So some people in there were doing the over the year update and it's happened with
[00:47:37.140 --> 00:47:41.460]   previous updates too when the phone rebooted it went into restore mode which gives you an indicator
[00:47:41.460 --> 00:47:46.020]   of plug your iPhone into iTunes it just it can't finish the update process on its own.
[00:47:46.020 --> 00:47:52.740]   And that has been fixed they said it happened to a small number of users you said in the first
[00:47:52.740 --> 00:47:57.860]   hour. Yeah so people like us who rushed to download it immediately got hit by it looks like a server
[00:47:57.860 --> 00:48:02.500]   glitch or something similar to that they basically got a bad version of the update. So if you got that
[00:48:02.500 --> 00:48:06.980]   what should you do should you restore your iPhone from iTunes? Yeah plug into iTunes and let it
[00:48:06.980 --> 00:48:11.300]   do the restore that way so it'll it'll contact a server that'll download it to your local machine
[00:48:11.300 --> 00:48:14.900]   through iTunes. Okay take everything off the device update put everything back on the device.
[00:48:14.900 --> 00:48:18.820]   And mentally a pain especially if you're not home and you don't have your you know iTunes handy.
[00:48:18.820 --> 00:48:23.380]   I usually recommend it for any X dot zero updates anyway especially if you do an encrypted backup
[00:48:23.380 --> 00:48:27.380]   it just saves everything and then it doesn't do an update in place which means it's not moving so
[00:48:27.380 --> 00:48:31.220]   much stuff around it literally takes everything off updates puts everything back on right and to
[00:48:31.220 --> 00:48:35.780]   me to my mind at least it gives you more stable up. The only time I ever use iTunes is when I get a
[00:48:35.780 --> 00:48:42.180]   new iPhone and I want to back up the old iPhone via hardware instead of iCloud and restore it.
[00:48:42.180 --> 00:48:45.460]   It's the best way to do it now you make sure you click the encrypted box so you get all your
[00:48:45.460 --> 00:48:53.220]   passwords copied over. It's also a great opportunity to really go through go through every page of
[00:48:53.220 --> 00:48:58.100]   springboard look at every single app you've installed and remove anything literally move
[00:48:58.100 --> 00:49:02.020]   remove everything you have not used in the past two weeks. This is the only time that I think that
[00:49:02.020 --> 00:49:07.140]   that closet that closet clean out tip actually works where if you have not launched this in two
[00:49:07.140 --> 00:49:12.740]   weeks just get rid of it. Does it spark joy? Because obviously is it one difference now?
[00:49:13.860 --> 00:49:18.980]   Only only only because if you haven't used it in two weeks there's a good chance you will never
[00:49:18.980 --> 00:49:22.740]   use it again and if you want to use it again it's just like one quick download away.
[00:49:22.740 --> 00:49:29.060]   And the only difference now iTunes previously would restore apps as well and now it often won't
[00:49:29.060 --> 00:49:33.620]   because Apple is using that new app thinning technology where it actually gives you a version
[00:49:33.620 --> 00:49:38.260]   of the app specifically attuned to the device and processor that you're downloading it for.
[00:49:38.260 --> 00:49:41.860]   So you'll have to nowadays you'll have to redownload the apps even if you do an iTunes restore.
[00:49:42.980 --> 00:49:49.300]   Oh a little slower yeah okay so it'll the iTunes restore or restore everything except the apps and
[00:49:49.300 --> 00:49:54.660]   then it will go online and download the version version that's matched to the A10 in this case
[00:49:54.660 --> 00:49:59.620]   instead of the A9. Yeah Android has always done that so it's not going to discombobulate me but
[00:49:59.620 --> 00:50:05.060]   so people and I had seen this behavior before so people who say oh this is going to be a quick
[00:50:05.060 --> 00:50:08.820]   thing I'll just restore and I'll be back to know you're going to also then have to redownload all
[00:50:08.820 --> 00:50:12.580]   your apps. Yeah and your phone well I mean all the radios are going to be on it's going to be
[00:50:12.580 --> 00:50:17.940]   re-indexing spotlight keep a plug in live areas your battery life is going to be trashed for a day
[00:50:17.940 --> 00:50:22.500]   depending on your Wi-Fi connectivity a day and a half and it's not you know there might be battery
[00:50:22.500 --> 00:50:26.340]   life problems but you'll have no way of knowing for the first two days. The CPU will be very warm
[00:50:26.340 --> 00:50:32.820]   so keep your cats off of it yeah so don't don't judge seriously don't judge new ios updates until
[00:50:32.820 --> 00:50:37.140]   you've been using for about a week maybe even two weeks that's the only time when it's actually it's
[00:50:37.140 --> 00:50:42.820]   actually it really is like drop it really is like dropping a stone into still a tranquil water
[00:50:42.820 --> 00:50:47.220]   it takes there's turbulence and then it will settle down and then finally give you back to the
[00:50:47.220 --> 00:50:52.100]   Zen experience that you've always always known and loved. It's not just iOS 10 tvOS got updated
[00:50:52.100 --> 00:50:55.700]   today and probably the most interesting one watchOS that's the one where you're going to
[00:50:55.700 --> 00:50:59.940]   notice the biggest difference that's transformative that is the release that you wish you would have
[00:50:59.940 --> 00:51:04.740]   from since day one I went back at all the complaints that I made about Apple Watch in my first review
[00:51:04.740 --> 00:51:10.340]   like in August of last year as not as though they've all been solved but they've all been addressed
[00:51:10.340 --> 00:51:15.940]   it has something closer and I mean that it's the Apple Watch now has something closer to a point
[00:51:15.940 --> 00:51:21.140]   of view that was totally missing was trying to be every device that could possibly be to everyone
[00:51:21.140 --> 00:51:27.940]   now even the advertising for the Apple Watch says this is your fitness pal this is your online
[00:51:27.940 --> 00:51:32.660]   fitness enhanced to get out there and get your goals done sort of thing and also look at the
[00:51:32.660 --> 00:51:36.580]   wonderful also apps that we have they'll help you be more productive and not have to take your phone
[00:51:36.580 --> 00:51:40.980]   out of your pocket so much but really fitness fitness fitness active active active yeah and I
[00:51:40.980 --> 00:51:45.460]   think that's a key when the Apple Watch was first created I think that again it was so early in the
[00:51:45.460 --> 00:51:49.140]   market earlier than Apple usually enters but also had a lot of different owners and each of those
[00:51:49.140 --> 00:51:53.460]   owners had a different opinion on what it should be and now it's it's mostly under one owner and
[00:51:53.460 --> 00:51:57.700]   it's mostly got one purpose and that could be a factor of GPS being the big whiz bang new feature
[00:51:57.700 --> 00:52:01.380]   so apples you know that everything lined up behind that and maybe next time there'll be a different
[00:52:01.380 --> 00:52:04.900]   whiz bang feature and they'll have a very clear message around that but I think the age of you
[00:52:04.900 --> 00:52:10.420]   know six different jobs for the thing on your wrist to do is over and rightfully so it was just too
[00:52:10.420 --> 00:52:15.700]   much for a very limited user interface to handle you didn't know there was no minimal delightful
[00:52:15.700 --> 00:52:19.140]   product like with the iPhone everyone just got it and showed pinch to zoom and then everybody
[00:52:19.140 --> 00:52:23.380]   else wanted it with the Apple Watch it was unclear you know what what do I show and that doesn't make
[00:52:23.380 --> 00:52:27.540]   infectious joy and maybe we'll want to run out and get more of the product yeah it's also one of the
[00:52:27.540 --> 00:52:34.500]   clumsiest version 1.0s I can remember maybe even the clumsiest version 1.0 of any Apple product
[00:52:34.500 --> 00:52:42.260]   because there's just there you can see every argument inside Cupertino that was left unsettled
[00:52:42.260 --> 00:52:46.580]   it was while are people going to instinctively want to go for the digital crown or they're going
[00:52:46.580 --> 00:52:51.540]   to instinctively want to scroll on the screen we don't know what they'll do either well okay
[00:52:52.420 --> 00:52:57.700]   are people going to be interacting with apps or are they going to be interacting with glimpses we
[00:52:57.700 --> 00:53:02.020]   don't know so we'll just throw everything in there the amount of taps and the amount of interaction I
[00:53:02.020 --> 00:53:08.260]   had to do with the Apple Watch just to do the most basic simple things that I've been doing on
[00:53:08.260 --> 00:53:14.340]   Android Wear on my on my pebble watch on pretty much every other watch it was astounding I had
[00:53:14.340 --> 00:53:20.180]   that it was worse because I had to go through that first week of thinking I must be an idiot if I'm
[00:53:20.180 --> 00:53:24.580]   not figuring this out boy I can't believe that I spent I've been using for a week and this still
[00:53:24.580 --> 00:53:28.580]   I haven't figured out how I'm supposed to use this and it took me two or three weeks to accept that
[00:53:28.580 --> 00:53:33.380]   no this really is how there really is nothing to figure out it's just not well put together but
[00:53:33.380 --> 00:53:41.620]   the when I that was the I broke my uh no betas on your primary device rule for Apple Watch uh and
[00:53:41.620 --> 00:53:47.460]   just running the beta the first time there you go that was it that was that was like being in that
[00:53:47.460 --> 00:53:53.540]   the secret room in Cupertino uh two months before the launch being shown we've got the we've got five
[00:53:53.540 --> 00:53:59.140]   different ideas on this table which one should we ship chairman and not go and I would have pointed
[00:53:59.140 --> 00:54:07.380]   directly to watch 3.0 saying that's the one yeah uh anything else to say about uh the watch before we
[00:54:07.380 --> 00:54:12.900]   only that I think I think that on top of the GPS being a good idea it's just I love the fact that
[00:54:12.900 --> 00:54:17.860]   there is a they retained series one where they're officially calling it the series one watch
[00:54:17.860 --> 00:54:24.260]   and that you can buy it for something akin to what you would what you would get for a good
[00:54:24.260 --> 00:54:29.300]   Android Wear watch that I think that was important because it really has to compete now that they're
[00:54:29.300 --> 00:54:35.220]   aggressively saying we're not trying to get Hollywood Hollywood tastemakers to give us
[00:54:35.220 --> 00:54:39.700]   $16,000 for the gold watch that they're gonna wear once we are now trying to get this watch on as
[00:54:39.700 --> 00:54:44.020]   many risks as possible uh I think that's good that was an important habit it's it was not it's
[00:54:44.020 --> 00:54:47.860]   only about a hundred bucks but I think it was a really important hundred bucks you they didn't
[00:54:47.860 --> 00:54:52.100]   demonstrate the squirting technique I want to know if that can be weaponized they're like
[00:54:52.100 --> 00:54:56.100]   certain they were talking could we just wait and then time for a war press the button and suddenly
[00:54:56.100 --> 00:55:00.260]   starts spraying each other um the only thing I was really happy about too is they didn't just
[00:55:00.260 --> 00:55:05.460]   keep um series zero around they actually updated the processor it's got a two two core s1 chip now
[00:55:05.460 --> 00:55:10.820]   the s1 p as the as the slide called it and that means you're gonna get the speed advancements
[00:55:10.820 --> 00:55:14.660]   of watch oh could you could you tell if you saw when you looked at it when you played with it I
[00:55:14.660 --> 00:55:18.340]   presume you played with a new watch or did you I did they didn't have as far as I could tell they
[00:55:18.340 --> 00:55:23.460]   didn't have series one there they just had series two but series two was very fast yeah so you felt
[00:55:23.460 --> 00:55:27.620]   it you noticed yeah well I mean like what people were asking me about the iPhone 7 versus the
[00:55:27.620 --> 00:55:31.860]   iPhone 6s it's like watching a Lamborghini in a Veyron just screaming about you because there's
[00:55:31.860 --> 00:55:36.980]   no there's no apps that really peg those those I mean there is a huge with a 60 percent speed
[00:55:36.980 --> 00:55:43.300]   improvement from the f on 6 to the 7 but uh it's again it's not like everyone goes fast with
[00:55:43.300 --> 00:55:47.220]   the Lamborghini right I always tell people well do you feel like your phone is slow and think of
[00:55:47.220 --> 00:55:53.860]   them will know so what do you care it's to enable pass like adobe like to get really new apps
[00:55:53.860 --> 00:55:57.620]   applications yeah and to let them do things in an unfettered way and a lot of times it's not just
[00:55:57.620 --> 00:56:01.700]   speed it's how fast the processor can go without exceeding thermal limits and getting down ramp
[00:56:01.700 --> 00:56:06.100]   because you want sustained performance and what they're doing with this chip that's really interesting
[00:56:06.100 --> 00:56:10.660]   is they could just keep speed bumping it but eventually you start leaving things behind it's
[00:56:10.660 --> 00:56:14.740]   why the big little design was created it's like if you take giant bites of a cookie sometimes
[00:56:14.740 --> 00:56:18.100]   those bites aren't very efficient because there's only tiny little bits of a cookie left and so
[00:56:18.100 --> 00:56:22.580]   now they have this quad core design it's never quad core it never engages more than two cores at
[00:56:22.580 --> 00:56:27.140]   once but two of those cores are super efficient and do things in such an efficient way you get
[00:56:27.140 --> 00:56:31.860]   extended battery life out of it and the other ones are just mega powerful and they just chew
[00:56:31.860 --> 00:56:36.100]   through things as fast as possible and the chip the fusion part of the chip decides which
[00:56:36.100 --> 00:56:43.140]   wants to deploy almost like a grand central dispatch on a case-by-case basis yeah yeah that's it that's
[00:56:43.140 --> 00:56:47.140]   that's the right that's right in the money that I think that's why it's it's kind of dumb in this day
[00:56:47.140 --> 00:56:52.900]   and age to look at hairs hairs how many cores are inside the CPU here's the speed of the CPU it really
[00:56:52.900 --> 00:56:59.220]   is tailoring the CPU to the job and how do you manage those cores and having fast and fast high
[00:56:59.220 --> 00:57:04.500]   power slow low power CPUs is part of the reason why you're getting that those two extra hours of
[00:57:04.500 --> 00:57:09.780]   battery life and to circle back on what we were discussing earlier that you also see I think apple
[00:57:09.780 --> 00:57:14.020]   is also using the explanation that oh we're able to get because we removed the headphone jack we
[00:57:14.020 --> 00:57:17.620]   were able to that's part of why we were able to get a bigger battery in there and more battery life
[00:57:18.420 --> 00:57:24.660]   okay until I fix it tears this thing down and tells us what the capacity of that battery is
[00:57:24.660 --> 00:57:28.820]   I really do think that from what I know about the design of the CPU and how it works on other
[00:57:28.820 --> 00:57:33.460]   phones I'd be shocked if most of that performance enhancement does not come from just simply having
[00:57:33.460 --> 00:57:40.020]   two tiered sets of cores so that's the thing about the fusion that's you that that's unique
[00:57:40.020 --> 00:57:46.740]   and they it's not merely a brand name it's uh they've done something more than a traditional arm
[00:57:46.740 --> 00:57:53.860]   are there quad core arm chips for other yes harbor yeah and I think yeah it's mostly like
[00:57:53.860 --> 00:57:58.260]   for any said it's mostly the the limitation of a mobile arm processor is mostly about getting
[00:57:58.260 --> 00:58:02.420]   rid of all that heat because by the time you can you can make you can scale it up to whatever you
[00:58:02.420 --> 00:58:08.340]   want but there comes a point which you absolutely start to have to need a fan and that's a let's
[00:58:08.340 --> 00:58:14.260]   not have a fan on our phone yeah that was a sort of a comical point of some of the phones that
[00:58:14.260 --> 00:58:19.540]   Microsoft released last year lovely phones but when you have when you have a water cooled CPU
[00:58:19.540 --> 00:58:25.140]   I start to ask how much do I really need to run Windows 10 apps in desktop mode hosted by my phone
[00:58:25.140 --> 00:58:34.020]   yeah um although the world seems to be piling on at this point far I've mongi in the New York
[00:58:34.020 --> 00:58:41.220]   Times what's really missing from the new iPhone cutting edge design he's got a graphic of a guy
[00:58:41.220 --> 00:58:46.260]   yawning I mean first it was my porcelain 11 it fits in the same garage as last year and then it was
[00:58:46.260 --> 00:58:50.420]   my Rolex Submariner it fits my wrist the same way I don't know what I'm gonna do anymore Leo
[00:58:50.420 --> 00:58:55.860]   this life's not worth it I think we're I mean okay I understand what Farhad's saying uh and I've
[00:58:55.860 --> 00:59:00.260]   certainly made the joke that it seems like Johnny I've been on sabbatical for a couple of years I
[00:59:00.260 --> 00:59:04.180]   love Farhad but a couple of years ago he did iPhone is the worst phone ever made in two years
[00:59:04.180 --> 00:59:07.780]   later iPhone is the best phone ever made so I'm waiting for the two weeks before I pass any
[00:59:07.780 --> 00:59:13.620]   I haven't I haven't read the article but I've been hearing lots of I can't on the one hand I've
[00:59:13.620 --> 00:59:19.940]   my my position has always been the same that most people that physical design of a phone no
[00:59:19.940 --> 00:59:25.860]   matter what it is is something they appreciate for the amount of time it takes for Amazon to
[00:59:25.860 --> 00:59:30.180]   deliver their new phone case because they will put it in that they will put it in that that
[00:59:30.180 --> 00:59:35.700]   really that wonderful purple glitter glitter gel rubber case that makes it their own and then
[00:59:35.700 --> 00:59:40.820]   they don't care about it so that's a that's not a big thing to criticize apple about that said
[00:59:40.820 --> 00:59:48.740]   I can't pretend to I can't pretend that hey let me let's write you heard words about how the 2016
[00:59:48.740 --> 00:59:56.820]   rounded rectangle is different from the 2015 rounded record and yes there have apples design I mean
[00:59:56.820 --> 01:00:03.780]   app you could point to a few areas where apples design has left a little to be desired the the
[01:00:03.780 --> 01:00:10.580]   iPhone case with the bump battery I have to I think the earst not is gonna actually hurt the I
[01:00:10.580 --> 01:00:14.420]   think that's gonna hurt the earpods I mean because the technology is interesting it's like
[01:00:14.420 --> 01:00:19.220]   but I think people are very aware of what they look like when that's why Google last didn't take
[01:00:19.220 --> 01:00:23.780]   off you look like a jerk oh no that's not the same thing at all it's like will somebody not buy
[01:00:23.780 --> 01:00:29.060]   this phone because they wanted to have a pin and fourina like red stripe no no and that's the other
[01:00:29.060 --> 01:00:35.380]   side of this we are there's not much you can do to this fondle slab it is the illusory though the
[01:00:35.380 --> 01:00:40.020]   iPhone 6s was to the atom a complete rebuild like they use different aluminum they use different
[01:00:40.020 --> 01:00:44.500]   glass they use different that phone atomically was completely different it just happened to be
[01:00:44.500 --> 01:00:48.260]   poured into the same mold and for that you know they got a lot of heat and all this year again
[01:00:48.260 --> 01:00:52.660]   it like the jet black one that's a completely new process there's industrial design stuff being
[01:00:52.660 --> 01:00:56.740]   done with these phones that nobody on earth is doing but it's a round-wreck like if you made
[01:00:56.740 --> 01:01:02.180]   it a triangle it'd be exciting but I just I think we've gotten to the point where these phones are
[01:01:02.180 --> 01:01:06.020]   pretty much like I look at all of my phones my Samsung phones that we have on you and residential
[01:01:06.020 --> 01:01:09.700]   they're not that different every year the HTCs that I love they're not that different every year I
[01:01:09.700 --> 01:01:15.940]   think we've come to an ideal form of phones watch because next year if apple makes a 10th anniversary
[01:01:15.940 --> 01:01:20.980]   iPhone that's dramatically different people are gonna say oh there's change for change is
[01:01:20.980 --> 01:01:26.980]   sake and or it won't be I mean it'll be a round-of-rectangle with more glass on the front like in the galaxy
[01:01:26.980 --> 01:01:31.220]   I think there's you have to write something there you know you got those 800 words to fill you got
[01:01:31.220 --> 01:01:36.260]   to write something well that there are there are people who aren't serious about their business
[01:01:36.260 --> 01:01:42.420]   and I feel as though to really complain about the fact that like this phone the case is made out
[01:01:42.420 --> 01:01:46.660]   of plastic instead of something that there's a special video to explain the formulation of the
[01:01:46.660 --> 01:01:52.260]   special metal that went into it if you're fascinated by that if you run a design blog great but if you
[01:01:52.260 --> 01:01:57.540]   really think that the failure of this phone is due to the fact that the case is mounted plastic and
[01:01:57.540 --> 01:02:04.100]   not because it doesn't have as much operable ram system ram as another phone that's not a review
[01:02:04.100 --> 01:02:10.100]   that I'm interested in talking about similarly if someone wants to be fascinated by again what is
[01:02:10.100 --> 01:02:15.380]   to me is I write the line it's an aluminum phone I move on to the next line I'm not fascinated by
[01:02:15.380 --> 01:02:21.140]   it's a special kind of magic aluminum that reduced weight by one tenth of a gram and allows the case
[01:02:21.140 --> 01:02:27.060]   to be one micros app is apple is and I am frankly I think one of the things that's most interesting
[01:02:27.060 --> 01:02:32.020]   about apple in these events has become the material science that they've started to use as
[01:02:32.020 --> 01:02:38.500]   really cares but right it doesn't affect the functionality or the utility I'm glad that there
[01:02:38.500 --> 01:02:42.980]   are people that I'm not I'm not being sarcastic here I'm glad that there are people that are such
[01:02:42.980 --> 01:02:48.500]   typography wonks right they can really really get into here's why the new syribs in the San Francisco
[01:02:48.500 --> 01:02:54.100]   font are an important shift from the syribs in the pre-sus of font exactly but I can say okay
[01:02:54.100 --> 01:02:58.340]   does it does it look pretty yes is it readable yes okay I'm moving on I don't it's not something
[01:02:58.340 --> 01:03:03.220]   that most people are going to pay attention again they want to know how fast will it take for an
[01:03:03.220 --> 01:03:08.900]   app to launch when when something when I want to take a picture will that thing that's happening
[01:03:08.900 --> 01:03:12.820]   they want to take a picture of be over with by the time I can actually have a live shutter button
[01:03:12.820 --> 01:03:18.740]   going that's just there's a lot Mossberg apple the king of tech taste and daring takes a breather
[01:03:18.740 --> 01:03:26.020]   so there is this pile on going on of people and I'm not sure they're far wrong Farhad brings up
[01:03:26.020 --> 01:03:31.140]   you know the apple tv remote which I think everybody will agree was that's a functional problem
[01:03:31.140 --> 01:03:38.260]   that's embarrassing is a bad functional problem but and part of it is I don't think the iPhone I
[01:03:38.260 --> 01:03:44.340]   don't think Apple anymore is the same apple of years back where they could take a category
[01:03:44.340 --> 01:03:50.020]   and completely turn it on its ear I think this is a problem every company faces when you start
[01:03:50.020 --> 01:03:56.340]   making a lot of money you become wildly successful there's increasing disincentive to rock the boat
[01:03:56.340 --> 01:04:01.780]   you only rock the boat if you stay hungry and stay foolish and Steve Jobs phrase that he stole from
[01:04:01.780 --> 01:04:07.140]   Stuart Brand he just he acknowledged it great artist great artist no he acknowledged it he always
[01:04:07.140 --> 01:04:10.740]   said it was Stuart Brand and said it it's the back of the whole earth catalog but it's hard to stay
[01:04:10.740 --> 01:04:16.020]   hungry and foolish if you're the most successful company in the history of companies you just
[01:04:16.020 --> 01:04:21.060]   that's inevitable and no one would expect you to do differently if you're fat and happy
[01:04:21.060 --> 01:04:26.740]   why should you be saying we've got to take this industry and set it on its ear it just doesn't
[01:04:26.740 --> 01:04:32.820]   happen all of I'll counterpoint to that by saying the Mac Pro which that you talk about needing
[01:04:32.820 --> 01:04:37.700]   courage that was a courageous thing to do because it was not the device that the people who were
[01:04:37.700 --> 01:04:42.420]   saving up for new Mac Pro wanted it's not a shape we've seen in a high performance machine ever
[01:04:42.420 --> 01:04:47.860]   the move to not just 4k but 5k displays not something that any consumer had said
[01:04:47.860 --> 01:04:54.340]   consumers saying please let us have this new Intel CPU that my friends have had in their games
[01:04:54.340 --> 01:04:57.860]   for a year now but they said no let's let's give you a 5k display
[01:04:58.820 --> 01:05:03.940]   basically making it the most wonderful like one screen editing suite for photos and video ever
[01:05:03.940 --> 01:05:11.060]   so I think that I think that they've lost their excitement for new shapes obviously you can see
[01:05:11.060 --> 01:05:17.540]   that the fact that they did they went for a high gloss black finish which is really hard to do
[01:05:17.540 --> 01:05:23.060]   a white ceramic watch which is really hard to do they're more fascinated by pushing the envelope
[01:05:23.060 --> 01:05:29.540]   and how can we manufacture this in bulk instead of making this as a limited luxury item where we
[01:05:29.540 --> 01:05:35.140]   can afford to throw out a hundred of these let's make this a mass culture device with this piano
[01:05:35.140 --> 01:05:39.620]   black finish even though we know that it's not going to look as good as it left the factory until
[01:05:39.620 --> 01:05:45.460]   the moment that it actually hits air or anything like that so they do stuff I this is why I kind of
[01:05:45.460 --> 01:05:50.500]   wish that Apple still had that Apple catalog they had remember from the 90s where they had an Apple
[01:05:50.500 --> 01:05:55.940]   brand logoed win sale a sale board and Apple branded jacket because I would go after not doing
[01:05:55.940 --> 01:06:00.980]   that I would like to I would like to see that if someone has if someone inside that design studio
[01:06:00.980 --> 01:06:06.340]   has a really great idea for a pen I would love for me to be able to go into an Apple store and
[01:06:06.340 --> 01:06:11.860]   for $50 not necessarily not for a thousand dollars by here is a really awesomely designed pen that
[01:06:11.860 --> 01:06:16.340]   we designed because we just had this really interesting design idea and we decided to go ahead and make
[01:06:16.340 --> 01:06:24.820]   it what else is there to say about toaster Apple toaster what is else is there to say about the phone
[01:06:24.820 --> 01:06:29.300]   if we have we said everything just well about the camera is turning out to be super interesting
[01:06:29.300 --> 01:06:37.380]   partly because of it do we all know that it has a normal what you might call a normal lens
[01:06:37.380 --> 01:06:43.540]   that's built that you'd find find in any iPhone or any other phone and it has a well
[01:06:44.820 --> 01:06:50.260]   close to a 50 millimeter like a 2x optical lens next to it the primary lens is interesting because
[01:06:50.260 --> 01:06:57.300]   they've gone down to f1.8 and I test so many phones and some of them are designed to be
[01:06:57.300 --> 01:07:02.740]   they really bend over backwards to do exceptional things to try to make better pictures
[01:07:02.740 --> 01:07:07.780]   but the one thing that is a slam dunk is if you give if you give the phone a wider aperture
[01:07:07.780 --> 01:07:12.820]   that means that it just simply without doing anything funny with image processing or image sensor
[01:07:12.820 --> 01:07:17.940]   you are just letting more light in every time you trip the shutter which means that you have to go
[01:07:17.940 --> 01:07:24.420]   to those noisy higher ISO's left less often and it always means better pictures in every single
[01:07:24.420 --> 01:07:29.460]   situation so that's probably the nicest thing that they've added to the camera the interesting
[01:07:29.460 --> 01:07:37.300]   thing is that the telephoto lens is f2.8 so it's not quite as slower as light hungry so when I get my
[01:07:38.420 --> 01:07:43.380]   my samples and I try to start playing with them I'm gonna I'll be interested to see if for instance
[01:07:43.380 --> 01:07:48.900]   you might get better photos if you take it if you take a photo with the normal lens that can
[01:07:48.900 --> 01:07:55.300]   let in all that extra light and then simply magnify it a little bit rather than use these the optical
[01:07:55.300 --> 01:08:01.380]   zoom lens but have that wider excuse me that less light light hungry aperture but obviously
[01:08:01.380 --> 01:08:05.540]   no one has been able to try the the portrait mode yet because that hasn't shipped but that's another
[01:08:05.540 --> 01:08:12.020]   thing we're going to be interested in looking at yeah I you know the as we mentioned the effective
[01:08:12.020 --> 01:08:18.020]   length of these two lenses is 28 millimeter for the wide which is pretty traditional on
[01:08:18.020 --> 01:08:24.260]   almost all smartphones are around 28 millimeter effective and then the quote telephoto isn't really
[01:08:24.260 --> 01:08:29.300]   telephoto it's 56 millimeters it's double that so it's really more of a normal lens but if you've
[01:08:29.300 --> 01:08:34.420]   been using 28 it will be twice as it'll be zoomed and it bright sunlight there's nothing but upside
[01:08:34.420 --> 01:08:40.500]   yeah so it's F2.8 it's not super slow it's just not that's not so I think by contrast
[01:08:40.500 --> 01:08:47.540]   Motorola got a lot of press last week at the big consumer electronics show in in Berlin because
[01:08:47.540 --> 01:08:53.380]   they teamed up with Hasselblad to design a camera back for the new Moto Z phone that's yeah
[01:08:53.380 --> 01:08:57.940]   one that has a clip on back so oh my god it's Hasselblad oh my god it has its own image sensor oh my god
[01:08:57.940 --> 01:09:04.420]   it has a flash it has an actual zoom lens this must be awesome but the again the the stock lens on
[01:09:04.420 --> 01:09:13.860]   the iPhone has is F1.8 the telephoto the 2x lens is F2.8 the most light sensitive aperture on this
[01:09:13.860 --> 01:09:20.100]   $250 Hasselblad accessory is F3.5% and my understanding is it's Hasselblad and name only
[01:09:20.100 --> 01:09:25.780]   Hasselblad's done is before remember Sony made the similar things and Hasselblad has been selling
[01:09:25.780 --> 01:09:32.420]   Hasselblad's with Sony sensors that are essentially Sony a7 cameras so or RX cameras I can't
[01:09:32.420 --> 01:09:38.260]   I think it's the RX but so was there moon cameras yeah yeah so I you know Hasselblad is like many
[01:09:38.260 --> 01:09:43.860]   brands been a little diluted that's unfortunate yeah but yeah so that just serves the point that
[01:09:43.860 --> 01:09:51.860]   the fact that so basic the basic upshot is that the Moto Z normal camera in most situations takes
[01:09:51.860 --> 01:09:57.380]   a better picture than it does with this $250 optical lens zoom that's funny that's really sad if
[01:09:57.380 --> 01:10:04.820]   that's a starly funny I did play with an LG G5 that had a very similar dual lens feature to the apple
[01:10:04.820 --> 01:10:10.420]   iPhone it had in fact it even had a button that said which lens do you want to use just like the
[01:10:10.420 --> 01:10:16.180]   new iPhone does and it did some interpolation between the two so you had and I'm curious what
[01:10:16.180 --> 01:10:21.700]   the iPhone will look like when you go from the 28 to the 56 it's not exactly digital zoom
[01:10:21.700 --> 01:10:26.740]   you're getting data I think from both cameras or maybe you know that's what I want to know is
[01:10:26.740 --> 01:10:31.140]   are you just using one camera zooming to a point and then I believe it's a fusion so that would be
[01:10:31.140 --> 01:10:35.700]   interesting in apples camera app it's the same thing like with manual controls apple has them in iOS
[01:10:35.700 --> 01:10:39.460]   but you never see them in their camera app so you can use individual cameras in third-party
[01:10:39.460 --> 01:10:44.020]   apps but an apples app it does a fusion of both okay then it lets you transition between that should
[01:10:44.020 --> 01:10:48.180]   look better than a digital zoom and also raw like it doesn't shoot issues in jpeg in the camera
[01:10:48.180 --> 01:10:53.140]   app but if you use a third-party app you can see the raw dng which is great raw raw is a huge huge
[01:10:53.140 --> 01:10:59.060]   plus two very excited so I'm I'm curious I'm going to get my camera briefing I'm going to need like
[01:10:59.060 --> 01:11:05.860]   an extra 45 minutes just for the camera stuff but it's I'm most excited about the dual camera setup
[01:11:05.860 --> 01:11:10.260]   because it means that not just the features that they're delivering today but the idea of having
[01:11:10.260 --> 01:11:16.980]   two separate lenses two separate image sensors the way that apple has from practically from day one
[01:11:16.980 --> 01:11:21.700]   with the camera system done synthetic photos of just you have no idea what it's doing behind the
[01:11:21.700 --> 01:11:26.740]   scenes how many exposures is taking how many pictures is taking and then melding to solve problems
[01:11:26.740 --> 01:11:30.820]   that it sees in the picture that you took now it has this extra tool to try to figure out if it's
[01:11:30.820 --> 01:11:36.980]   confused about whether something in the background is actually dark shadow or whether it's actually
[01:11:36.980 --> 01:11:43.300]   just a dark colored bush to be able to get have two cameras voting on that to decide
[01:11:43.300 --> 01:11:47.620]   what should go in there the idea of what they could and they could enhance the camera app with
[01:11:47.620 --> 01:11:54.100]   just by adding software and just by getting at the data I can't even imagine what they would do
[01:11:54.100 --> 01:11:59.300]   what would what third-party apps would do if they ever got access to the separate sensors
[01:11:59.300 --> 01:12:04.580]   independently it really isn't exciting here's from andre cutting hands review on ours Technica
[01:12:04.580 --> 01:12:11.300]   this is the 28 millimeter lens and this is the 56 millimeter lens so it's not you know it's not
[01:12:11.300 --> 01:12:17.620]   like a really long telephoto it's but you know you're zooming in a little bit what and by the way
[01:12:17.620 --> 01:12:24.660]   the images you know this these are for mother iPhones the images do look pretty good compared
[01:12:24.660 --> 01:12:31.300]   to other phones I mean at this point we're really slicing pretty fine hairs here I think all
[01:12:31.300 --> 01:12:34.740]   the all the top of the line phones do a pretty decent job
[01:12:34.740 --> 01:12:40.820]   Bernad did you play with I appreciate it the home button yes tell us about that now according
[01:12:40.820 --> 01:12:46.180]   to Andrew there are three levels of haptic well you can choose so it's it's almost identical to
[01:12:46.180 --> 01:12:50.660]   3D touch not surprisingly because it's the same technology so it looks physically the same so if
[01:12:50.660 --> 01:12:54.660]   you have somebody who's you know short of vision or blind they'll still be able to feel it because
[01:12:54.660 --> 01:12:58.900]   the ring is still there and that ring is what detects the capacitance and turns on the sensor
[01:12:59.540 --> 01:13:04.020]   so once your finger touches that you depress it and then it feels like 3D touch on an iPhone 6
[01:13:04.020 --> 01:13:08.660]   it goes this is s yeah and you can go into settings home screen and you could choose the level you
[01:13:08.660 --> 01:13:13.140]   could choose light medium or heavy the same as you could for a 3D touch on the home screen and you
[01:13:13.140 --> 01:13:18.020]   pick which one feels best for you I like somewhere between medium and heavy I think in the beginning
[01:13:18.020 --> 01:13:20.900]   some people might default to heavy just because they really want to be sure they're pressing that
[01:13:20.900 --> 01:13:25.460]   thing but I think most people will end up on medium and then you press it down and you get this this
[01:13:25.460 --> 01:13:30.260]   regular sort of 3D touch style feedback but of course that's that's all appropriate set of illusion
[01:13:30.260 --> 01:13:35.620]   and because it's it can be controlled with a taptic engine and developers have access they can sort
[01:13:35.620 --> 01:13:40.500]   of create different things and apple was demonstrating for example when you when you press in iMessage
[01:13:40.500 --> 01:13:43.940]   it feels different than when you press you know for an alarm or something that just gives you a
[01:13:43.940 --> 01:13:48.500]   little bit of a sensory cue as to what you're doing and a couple people have mentioned this
[01:13:48.500 --> 01:13:53.140]   already but another apparently big reason for this is that a lot of people especially in Asian
[01:13:53.140 --> 01:13:57.220]   countries have decided that the home button is not reliable and to lower the resale value
[01:13:57.220 --> 01:14:01.780]   of their phone so they issue it and they use assistive touch from the accessibility settings
[01:14:01.780 --> 01:14:06.020]   because they don't want any mechanical failure and this removes completely the mechanical failure
[01:14:06.020 --> 01:14:10.980]   point so hopefully it'll it'll restore the glory of the home button i'm thinking because i'm used to
[01:14:10.980 --> 01:14:15.620]   android phones that don't have a mechanical it walks in for the Samsung don't have a mechanical
[01:14:15.620 --> 01:14:20.500]   home button i'm thinking i might turn off the haptic home button haptic entirely
[01:14:21.300 --> 01:14:26.420]   uh because i mean really you just press it right and it goes home it's not 3d touch like there's
[01:14:26.420 --> 01:14:29.940]   different levels of pressing it's either not pressed or pressed right because
[01:14:29.940 --> 01:14:34.260]   seemingly they could do that at some point but for now it's just right now it's yeah yeah uh
[01:14:34.260 --> 01:14:39.780]   also it's it's an important accessibility feature absolutely i agree i mean i'm just saying for me
[01:14:39.780 --> 01:14:44.100]   yeah i'm glad i'm glad that they actually have a physical ring that you can actually locate
[01:14:44.100 --> 01:14:48.980]   i touch because i can't imagine how how screwed up the phone would be well and on Nexus phones which
[01:14:48.980 --> 01:14:55.700]   which are just on screen images it is sometimes hard to find the button and know you're on the right
[01:14:55.700 --> 01:15:01.060]   button so i like the idea i i think this is the best of both worlds except for the large bezel
[01:15:01.060 --> 01:15:07.060]   it it requires because you're dead then you're yeah exactly i think next year i think that when we
[01:15:07.060 --> 01:15:12.100]   when we have this conversation this time next year we will be pointing at a lot of stuff that a lot
[01:15:12.100 --> 01:15:16.500]   of people didn't like this year right that they had to put up with so that they would stop complaining
[01:15:16.500 --> 01:15:21.380]   by september of 2017 i think you said that i think it's the most credible story for the
[01:15:21.380 --> 01:15:25.060]   headphone jack is they wanted to remove it now so it doesn't become the story next year
[01:15:25.060 --> 01:15:29.300]   and they could focus on other things either that or at some point in history a headphone jack
[01:15:29.300 --> 01:15:33.460]   killed johnny ise parents and he's working the majors result like training and getting to where
[01:15:33.460 --> 01:15:38.980]   he is so that one day one day he could have his revenge did you like the haptic feedback it wasn't
[01:15:38.980 --> 01:15:43.460]   the same as actually a physical push button right it's you know they've changed the whole haptic
[01:15:43.460 --> 01:15:47.300]   system the haptic engine is much better and when you play games now for example you press they had a
[01:15:47.300 --> 01:15:52.260]   combat game you press it on a machine gun and you feel it go that it is nice and i said don't
[01:15:52.260 --> 01:15:57.860]   don't don't and it was it was really discernibly different so it takes most people i was talking
[01:15:57.860 --> 01:16:01.540]   to apple but this takes most people a day to get used to it it took me about five minutes because
[01:16:01.540 --> 01:16:06.420]   i used 3d touch all the time and it just felt like 3d touch to me and some people at the event hated
[01:16:06.420 --> 01:16:10.100]   it and still hate it and other people didn't think twice about it so it's going to be a personal
[01:16:10.100 --> 01:16:14.980]   thing but i think for most people again after a couple months it'll my biggest problem is that
[01:16:14.980 --> 01:16:19.140]   once again i go back to using the ipad and i feel like an animal because i push on it and it
[01:16:19.140 --> 01:16:23.300]   doesn't work the way my iphone works and it was the same thing when i put the touch id on it and now
[01:16:23.300 --> 01:16:27.300]   once again i'm i'm pressing it and i have to actually remember to physically press mechanical button
[01:16:27.300 --> 01:16:31.700]   right it's hard to change it's quickly and it's hard to go back this is another one of those
[01:16:31.700 --> 01:16:38.660]   releases where i wouldn't trust uh positive or negative reviews for a few weeks uh because
[01:16:38.660 --> 01:16:42.820]   i guess when you know we like it when you take when you take a physical clicky button away and you
[01:16:42.820 --> 01:16:48.500]   return you replace with haptics it really does take a while for your brain to reprogram itself to
[01:16:48.500 --> 01:16:52.820]   stop saying this is wrong this is wrong this is wrong this is wrong it's simply accepted oh no this
[01:16:52.820 --> 01:16:57.300]   is just a little difference perfectly okay yeah i'm also weird in that you put me in one of those
[01:16:57.300 --> 01:17:00.660]   you know you put in a mac keyboard or an ipad keyboard in five minutes i'm totally happy it's
[01:17:00.660 --> 01:17:05.620]   like i've forgotten any other keyboard existed so i'm just still not getting used to the macbook i
[01:17:05.620 --> 01:17:11.380]   just i still make mistakes on the macbook and you know i thought it was well this is a requirement
[01:17:11.380 --> 01:17:17.540]   of being that thin but now i have the hp specter which is actually slightly thinner but it's roughly
[01:17:17.540 --> 01:17:22.340]   the same and it has a much better travel keyboard and i don't have the same problems with that
[01:17:22.340 --> 01:17:27.780]   keyboard and so it's kind of highlighted for me um after a year now of using the macbook that i'm
[01:17:27.780 --> 01:17:31.940]   still not happy with that keyboard i never really get used to it i think i think i wrote i think i
[01:17:31.940 --> 01:17:35.780]   wrote about this a while ago that it but i didn't i didn't put it this way i i wonder if like
[01:17:35.780 --> 01:17:41.380]   i want to do freeze frame the last then at the latest like johnnie i video because i kind of have
[01:17:41.380 --> 01:17:46.740]   this what with this worry that he's like doctor no he he he has he's had his hands replaced by these
[01:17:46.740 --> 01:17:52.020]   robot hands that can't actually feel anything because it seems like if the times where apple
[01:17:52.020 --> 01:17:57.220]   absolutely consistently drops the ball is anything that the user has anything it's not the iphone
[01:17:57.220 --> 01:18:03.940]   the user actually has to touch or hold their mouse's stink their keyboards are just metz-a-metz-a
[01:18:03.940 --> 01:18:10.100]   too bad uh the their the pencil is nice but they forgot well what if how do you put it in a pocket
[01:18:10.100 --> 01:18:16.020]   without matching the the key the the apple remote is an embarrassment uh it's just it's weird that
[01:18:16.020 --> 01:18:20.740]   when you put some put your hands on something that's the one place where you where apple is the most
[01:18:20.740 --> 01:18:25.140]   ordinary company in the world the most ordinary fallible company in the world it's true of any
[01:18:25.140 --> 01:18:29.380]   company there's always blind spots and apples always had blind spots i always thought steve had
[01:18:29.380 --> 01:18:35.380]   a blind spot on on audio um not because he didn't love great music because he did but this but the
[01:18:35.380 --> 01:18:40.420]   beeps and the boops that macintosh hebson just they one never got better really much and they were
[01:18:40.420 --> 01:18:46.420]   and they're always this so sumi has always been annoying and terrible and it just i just thought
[01:18:46.420 --> 01:18:51.700]   well i think steve just doesn't care about that and ever since they dropped the that majestic apple
[01:18:51.700 --> 01:18:58.900]   to ci chime i like the bong yeah it's it's they just they never never the same um
[01:18:58.900 --> 01:19:05.300]   by the way i was corrected yesterday because i've been saying haptic somebody said um leon's
[01:19:05.300 --> 01:19:11.780]   taptic the engine is taptic the feedback is haptic it's just because apple brand and what they call
[01:19:11.780 --> 01:19:16.980]   the it's a brand it's all just a registered trademark of adobe to be used interchangeably
[01:19:16.980 --> 01:19:24.100]   with photo editing i i was very dismissive yesterday i apologize for being a little snotty uh i
[01:19:24.100 --> 01:19:29.540]   but i just wanted to make sure i wasn't completely off base it's not velcro it's hook and little
[01:19:29.540 --> 01:19:36.020]   fabric yes it's haptic is haptic okay just one just checking thank you um i you know what it's funny
[01:19:36.020 --> 01:19:42.580]   i i the these shows and it's true also of windows weekly and security nouns stuff i
[01:19:42.580 --> 01:19:47.220]   i defer judgment on a lot of stuff until i know i'm gonna hear from andi and rene

[01:20:08.420 --> 01:20:13.380]   i'more you've got just article after article about all of this stuff so uh snotty ran a lot of the
[01:20:13.380 --> 01:20:17.220]   coverage and we have a we have actual team this year you know four five people how many people
[01:20:17.220 --> 01:20:22.820]   were there because your blog your live blog was buzzing man we had snotty uh andi were there
[01:20:22.820 --> 01:20:26.420]   daniel beta one of our colleagues was there for Canadian coverage and then we had three or four
[01:20:26.420 --> 01:20:32.340]   people uh on the ground with us it was like you know a lot of times live blogs are like and then
[01:20:32.340 --> 01:20:35.620]   he got up on stage and then it was like you guys were taught we're having a conference
[01:20:35.620 --> 01:20:42.020]   say show it's like watching the chat room was awesome it was really well done i appreciate it i m o r e
[01:20:42.020 --> 01:20:50.260]   i more dot com all sorts of stuff getting you ready for ios 10 how to install it
[01:20:50.260 --> 01:20:54.980]   i have found a number of apps that don't work well with ios 10
[01:20:54.980 --> 01:21:02.500]   um including my hearing aid app which i love and i called them and they said yeah we we take a few
[01:21:02.500 --> 01:21:06.900]   days after ios 10 comes or new ios version comes out to test it then we have to update our
[01:21:06.900 --> 01:21:13.300]   application because they do stuff they kind of do low end uh driver stuff the hearing aids for
[01:21:13.300 --> 01:21:18.100]   instance and this is why i'm kind of thinking where i'm thinking where the airpods could go
[01:21:18.100 --> 01:21:22.660]   i can listen to a book uh or or have a phone conversation my iPhone and the hearing aids do the
[01:21:22.660 --> 01:21:28.100]   audio and so i don't i it's wonderful you can you can walk down the street nobody knows you're
[01:21:28.100 --> 01:21:34.740]   not listening to them you're listening to a book it's very nice except it doesn't work for the
[01:21:34.740 --> 01:21:38.820]   last time you also work during presidential debate so you can sound as though uh-huh it's very much
[01:21:38.820 --> 01:21:44.100]   like that i don't have to memorize lines anymore everything i say on the show i can be fed
[01:21:44.100 --> 01:21:48.260]   karstens constantly feeding me machine learning and artificial intelligence powering lee or the
[01:21:48.260 --> 01:21:54.180]   port people used to think that the constant question on tech tv was so leo doesn't actually
[01:21:54.180 --> 01:21:59.220]   know anything they're just telling him what to say in his ear right bill gates is on one phone
[01:21:59.220 --> 01:22:03.140]   steve jobs on the other just feeding him all the answer wait let me check sure to call them
[01:22:03.140 --> 01:22:08.180]   undocumented americans and not scum and parasites no don't say that
[01:22:08.180 --> 01:22:11.620]   it's not really coming really is breaking it again talking
[01:22:11.620 --> 01:22:21.060]   the voices in my head are showed today are you sure today brought to you by gazelle whenever
[01:22:21.060 --> 01:22:26.420]   there's a new iphone it's a time to go to gazelle see what your old phone is worth go as soon as you
[01:22:26.420 --> 01:22:30.340]   can because of course your old phone is getting less valuable all the time but the great thing is
[01:22:30.340 --> 01:22:36.180]   there's somebody at gazelle who'll take that phone off your hands you can go get a quote at gazelle
[01:22:36.180 --> 01:22:43.060]   l lee dot com it's good for 30 days which is fantastic it means there's no rush you can even
[01:22:43.060 --> 01:22:47.460]   if you're not sure you're gonna get your iphone or you're not getting it till november as i know
[01:22:47.460 --> 01:22:52.660]   many people you still have time you can go there right now get your quote for your existing iphone
[01:22:52.660 --> 01:22:58.660]   and that's guaranteed for 30 days that'll give you plenty of time to get the new phone transfer
[01:22:58.660 --> 01:23:04.500]   the data over make sure everything's working i am a fan and now one of the best things about
[01:23:04.500 --> 01:23:08.900]   because oh by the way i should mention don't just do your phone they take a lot of different
[01:23:08.900 --> 01:23:13.300]   stuffs tablets and computers and screens even old ipods have got lying around there they're
[01:23:13.300 --> 01:23:17.700]   one of the few places where you can take a broken iphone or ipad and sell it and get
[01:23:17.700 --> 01:23:22.660]   good money for it but you as long as you're gonna sell one thing to them just go through
[01:23:22.660 --> 01:23:27.140]   those drawers get all this stuff out there you're just leaving money on the table throw it in the
[01:23:27.140 --> 01:23:34.180]   box they pay postage on anything worth more than a buck and they'll turn it around fast they wipe
[01:23:34.180 --> 01:23:37.860]   your data if you can't or forget to like a broken ipad you might not be able to wipe the data don't
[01:23:37.860 --> 01:23:42.820]   worry they'll take care of that and then they'll send you a check if you're in a hurry you can get
[01:23:42.820 --> 01:23:47.700]   a paypal credit if you're a big amazon user as i am i always get the amazon gift card because
[01:23:47.700 --> 01:23:52.580]   that they bump up by five percent so it's like a little free money there shipping is free payment
[01:23:52.580 --> 01:24:00.180]   is fast it's a great way to sell your device now they also sell themselves and this is kind of cool
[01:24:00.180 --> 01:24:04.900]   and it's a good time to do is right now when there's a new iphone if you want to save money you can
[01:24:04.900 --> 01:24:11.540]   get last year's iphone and a really good deal from gazelle and by the way they give you a kind of a
[01:24:11.540 --> 01:24:16.900]   range of quality you can get it like brand new but if you want to save more money you can get
[01:24:16.900 --> 01:24:20.980]   slightly used and that never means like big scratch on the screen or anything it just means
[01:24:20.980 --> 01:24:26.340]   you know just lovingly used like your old phone would look if you'd taken really good care of it
[01:24:26.340 --> 01:24:31.540]   kept it in a case and all that they fully inspect anything they sell of course they have a great
[01:24:31.540 --> 01:24:37.140]   30 point inspection process that finds everything including scratches and things like that they
[01:24:37.140 --> 01:24:42.980]   also will back with a 30 day return policy so you never are on the hook for it and it's sold
[01:24:42.980 --> 01:24:47.620]   without carrier contract but of course all the phones they sell work with all the big carriers
[01:24:47.620 --> 01:24:53.620]   at and t verizon t mobile and sprint you can get financing right there at checkout from a firm
[01:24:53.620 --> 01:25:01.460]   easy payments you can also get 12 month warranty for cell phones and ipads that's from assurance

[01:25:23.380 --> 01:25:34.980]   of mac break weekly andy and not co should i get 256 gigs or 128 gigs or 64 gigs
[01:25:35.380 --> 01:25:41.140]   to i'd say max it out really yeah if it once you max it out you have the freedom to just shoot
[01:25:41.140 --> 01:25:46.820]   4k video all the time and once and i'm i'm serious once you get home and you realize that
[01:25:46.820 --> 01:25:52.980]   actually i can reframe this as a two shot or as a portrait even though i was actually quite far back
[01:25:52.980 --> 01:25:58.500]   that's you will forget about whoever long you had to wait or however much you spent for 256 gigs.
[01:25:59.060 --> 01:26:04.020]   All right you convinced me get the biggest that's nice 256 that's a ton.
[01:26:04.020 --> 01:26:08.580]   Yes you'll think so you'll think so for three weeks and four days.
[01:26:08.580 --> 01:26:17.460]   Uh what is i thought i thought 128 gigs on my ipad pro was oh my goodness what now i'm like okay
[01:26:17.460 --> 01:26:21.940]   what can i delete now to save the second home make hot drive make us in the world.
[01:26:21.940 --> 01:26:27.460]   Have to take off way the side of the building you got to throw but we think it's got to be worth it.
[01:26:27.460 --> 01:26:32.740]   Where do we stand is there anybody who does a website these days on a lead time now
[01:26:32.740 --> 01:26:39.220]   how long are we in november on every model uh i think i'm pretty close it used to be good at keeping
[01:26:39.220 --> 01:26:43.940]   track for that but and this is the question i think some people are asking what if i just go to the
[01:26:43.940 --> 01:26:48.740]   store on friday they'll have stock yeah that's your best course of action if you want it now.
[01:26:48.740 --> 01:26:54.100]   Will they have the jet black if you get the market usually the big markets will have a few of them.
[01:26:54.100 --> 01:27:00.180]   Really yeah i would say i would say that my my usual thing is that if you did not if you if you
[01:27:00.180 --> 01:27:07.220]   didn't wake up until three oh one a.m. on first order day if you pick a store in a strip malls not
[01:27:07.220 --> 01:27:12.100]   a landmark store not with one with glass that has that's that's been an app in an apple keynote
[01:27:12.100 --> 01:27:17.700]   about how beautiful this thing is i'm talking about go to the east dog leg of the moningis dog
[01:27:18.500 --> 01:27:25.220]   airport center rosa i'm not i'm not judging but those and you there will still be a few people
[01:27:25.220 --> 01:27:29.780]   lined up but they will get they will also get their allotment of devices do i need to go to
[01:27:29.780 --> 01:27:35.140]   oh people are already lining up oh my god but that's in manhattan where they're going to get mainstream
[01:27:35.140 --> 01:27:40.100]   media coverage right and most of those people are being paid the publicity horse should i wait in
[01:27:40.100 --> 01:27:47.940]   line or should i just walk in tomorrow don't megan was saying she walked in yet last year at like 11
[01:27:47.940 --> 01:27:53.540]   she said because the stores are getting continual shipments yeah everything's again i mean there

[01:28:10.100 --> 01:28:15.860]   what two weeks to just to take it back and not even explain why yeah oh really so even if i get one on
[01:28:15.860 --> 01:28:20.660]   friday in the mail i still could go to the apple store and say i did you know hey do you have any
[01:28:20.660 --> 01:28:25.540]   jet black you could you could take it with you on your trip and decide that you don't like the camera
[01:28:25.540 --> 01:28:29.860]   and so long as you didn't bend it so long as it doesn't look like crap so long as like you try to
[01:28:29.860 --> 01:28:34.740]   take care of it yeah and so long as that moisture sensor is has not been tripped because although
[01:28:34.740 --> 01:28:40.580]   it is i p67 it is still not warranted against water ingress uh they'll give you a refund they don't
[01:28:40.580 --> 01:28:46.420]   even ask do they do they take that little paper strip out of the phone now that they they they
[01:28:46.420 --> 01:28:52.020]   sound a little light into it yeah but do they still do that now that it's waterproof yeah oh
[01:28:52.020 --> 01:28:55.940]   i'm pretty sure yeah yeah i mean if you left it in a glass for seven days and then came in
[01:28:55.940 --> 01:29:05.140]   mark pelletier uh host of futures and biotech says my apple rep said no jet black till november
[01:29:05.140 --> 01:29:09.940]   you never know every previous year they've had at least one or two like i think at my store they
[01:29:09.940 --> 01:29:15.060]   had two uh rose gold last year and then they got a few more in and you know every day from then on
[01:29:15.060 --> 01:29:18.900]   well as i said i'm getting it on october fourth i'm being a little greedy here i'm getting it
[01:29:18.900 --> 01:29:22.900]   on october fourth you're i mean see you're a special case because you are leaving on a trip
[01:29:22.900 --> 01:29:27.140]   right and which maybe and people like to take good pictures on trips and by all
[01:29:27.140 --> 01:29:34.020]   indications this is a much better camera well but my my usual my usual advice is try try to
[01:29:34.020 --> 01:29:38.020]   understand the reasons why you feel as though you have to have it on the first day and solve that
[01:29:38.020 --> 01:29:44.020]   problem within yourself it's okay apple will continue to make more this not like this not like
[01:29:44.020 --> 01:29:49.540]   those those limited edition posters uh of empire strikes back where you have to be standing by
[01:29:49.540 --> 01:29:54.500]   twitter at the exact second they go on sale and then they will be gone forever at one minute later
[01:29:54.500 --> 01:29:57.700]   apple will make more than 17 i'm very very sure
[01:29:57.700 --> 01:30:04.660]   yeah and you know in a month it all it all evens that doesn't it yeah i'll also remember that as
[01:30:04.660 --> 01:30:10.020]   as as delighted as you will be with this device no matter what it is for the first two weeks
[01:30:10.020 --> 01:30:14.100]   two months later it will just be your phone you'll it'll just be the thing where as you're
[01:30:14.100 --> 01:30:18.980]   patting yourself down with your hand on the front row uh damn it forgot my damn phone hang on uh
[01:30:18.980 --> 01:30:22.180]   it'll just be time you have your new macbook pro it will just be your normal phone
[01:30:22.180 --> 01:30:28.260]   yeah i went am i getting my new macbook pro by the way october damn that's what i really need
[01:30:28.260 --> 01:30:33.540]   jeff black macbook pro you think those are going to be really cool if i i don't think they have that
[01:30:33.540 --> 01:30:39.460]   much jeff black yeah honestly if it really is that you have a limited amount of money and you know you
[01:30:39.460 --> 01:30:44.340]   you need a new notebook and a new phone it's sometime in the next year i'd be putting the money
[01:30:44.340 --> 01:30:48.660]   in the next macbook yeah what i've been telling people is if you have last year's iphone if you have
[01:30:48.660 --> 01:30:55.620]   a six s you can wait another year for this seven s or whatever or the tenth anniversary phone if
[01:30:55.620 --> 01:30:59.940]   you have a six or earlier you probably benefit considerably from getting the new phone it's almost
[01:30:59.940 --> 01:31:05.060]   always that way isn't it yeah i'm generally quite skeptical of people who feel in need to upgrade
[01:31:05.060 --> 01:31:08.580]   after year unless you've signed up for that plan where you're entitled to a new phone by
[01:31:08.580 --> 01:31:12.820]   swapping it in because you just pay a flat amount of money every month for your phone i really
[01:31:12.820 --> 01:31:19.620]   you got especially an apple phone it will last you at least two years three years is when um
[01:31:19.620 --> 01:31:25.460]   if you don't you really need to point at specific hardware features like if you don't have apple
[01:31:25.460 --> 01:31:30.420]   pay oh my goodness is your life about to get better once you get a phone with apple pay if you don't
[01:31:30.420 --> 01:31:34.660]   have if you don't have three years with the bands like last year they added band seven which a lot
[01:31:34.660 --> 01:31:38.260]   of people really wanted and this year they've added i forget which band 24 or something which could
[01:31:38.260 --> 01:31:43.380]   really help your reception if you're in an area where a lot of your lt's on that band yeah but
[01:31:43.380 --> 01:31:48.100]   otherwise yeah like Andy said but my my universal if if i start selling t-shirts one of them is going
[01:31:48.100 --> 01:31:53.220]   to have to be any new thing you buy should either create an opportunity or solve a problem if it
[01:31:53.220 --> 01:31:58.260]   doesn't do either or both of those things you probably don't need to buy it it makes your phone
[01:31:58.260 --> 01:32:04.340]   look like doth vader it makes your phone look like doth vader would you yeah would you record
[01:32:04.340 --> 01:32:07.700]   so bossy that if you get if you got attacked by one of those criminals you just like sort of
[01:32:07.700 --> 01:32:15.780]   hold it up and blind them at least i'll blast it oh blind blind here's a here's a video uh from uh
[01:32:15.780 --> 01:32:21.860]   a musical review of ios 10 from serenity green bloopers
[01:32:21.860 --> 01:32:39.620]   so is every feature in here uh the main features are
[01:32:39.620 --> 01:32:43.620]   it's a Jonathan man's song which means it's going to be in my head for the next month
[01:32:43.620 --> 01:32:49.780]   all right i'm uh i i am but an imperfect vessel to contain the perfection of the universe and
[01:32:49.780 --> 01:32:56.660]   therefore i have to admit that i wish i were as clever as she is i wish i had as much energy as she
[01:32:56.660 --> 01:33:04.020]   does to damn that woman jonathan man mica serge i was watching that video this morning and yeah damn
[01:33:04.020 --> 01:33:08.340]   her that it's uh i'm not gonna play a whole thing because i want everybody to watch it on uh
[01:33:08.340 --> 01:33:15.380]   youtube or i i'm more dot com i'm more dot com slash ios dash 10
[01:33:17.220 --> 01:33:22.500]   and now everybody can start messaging me with those weird messages they're adding they're adding
[01:33:22.500 --> 01:33:26.900]   message packs already there's new stuff right oh there's yeah this throw went live last night uh
[01:33:26.900 --> 01:33:32.180]   disney has stickers marvel has some different is it a separate marvel has dissapoints has really
[01:33:32.180 --> 01:33:37.540]   good stickers is it a separate so it's a separate store it's inside the messages app so if you tap
[01:33:37.540 --> 01:33:41.700]   uh there's a little more button on the left side of the text field and then you'll see a little
[01:33:41.700 --> 01:33:47.140]   app store icon you tap on that it'll show you all the apps that are originally are currently installed
[01:33:47.140 --> 01:33:50.900]   and then on the bottom left there's a button to get to more apps and you can hit the plus button
[01:33:50.900 --> 01:33:56.420]   and store it in the app store it so the more and then oh that's the a is the app store yes
[01:33:56.420 --> 01:33:59.780]   oh there's 13 holy cow
[01:33:59.780 --> 01:34:05.540]   look at all this oh and you can automatically add apps if you already have some of them
[01:34:05.540 --> 01:34:08.740]   and if i text you something and you don't have that app it'll give you the opportunity to get the
[01:34:08.740 --> 01:34:13.220]   app you know because it lives inside messages yes pn ever note fandango
[01:34:13.940 --> 01:34:17.620]   kayak is a secure messaging app Leo where you put in the message and you encrypt it and you
[01:34:17.620 --> 01:34:23.460]   encrypt it and you encrypt it automatically add it does it come out emojis is that how they secure
[01:34:23.460 --> 01:34:29.460]   it they should it emojif but stickers are like emoji on hulk serum there's they're just so much
[01:34:29.460 --> 01:34:34.900]   more expressive they can be animated look at all these parties carrots this is this is why some
[01:34:34.900 --> 01:34:39.940]   people get upset so they weren't clever or they didn't have enough enough gumption to put a headphone
[01:34:39.940 --> 01:34:44.580]   jack inside all the stuff but they had enough time on their hands to do emojis stickers
[01:34:44.580 --> 01:34:50.660]   that make the hulk smash your messages i'm buying i'm buying cat paint which allows you to add cats
[01:34:50.660 --> 01:34:58.500]   to any photo it's 99 cents here it is the power there's a there's a gift gift search engine you
[01:34:58.500 --> 01:35:04.580]   can add animated gift gifts to everything that you want oh my god so these this is all and there's
[01:35:04.580 --> 01:35:08.580]   payment apps you can do open tables so if i'm saying Leo where do you want to have a reservation we
[01:35:08.580 --> 01:35:12.900]   can make the reservation from right inside the messaging app and it's really great because humans
[01:35:12.900 --> 01:35:16.820]   are not good at context changing it's why when you switch rooms you forget why you went into the
[01:35:16.820 --> 01:35:20.500]   kitchen like i see a tweet and i want to read Leo's tweet and i go to twitter but then i see Andy
[01:35:20.500 --> 01:35:24.580]   said something and i leave twitter what about Leo's tweet and this lets you stay in one app
[01:35:24.580 --> 01:35:32.420]   in the context you want to be in and just do all these things oh so oh oh i'm in trouble now okay so
[01:35:32.420 --> 01:35:37.300]   this is the store yeah so tap that now the very bottom left Leo you there's like a little diagram
[01:35:37.300 --> 01:35:42.340]   of four dots on the on the left that's music well i'm so i'm confused i'm i'm getting two
[01:35:42.340 --> 01:35:49.380]   holes four dots there we go yeah and so this shows some what store plus okay yeah there you go now
[01:35:49.380 --> 01:35:54.660]   you're in the ten message jib jib fan dango open table square so some of these already have
[01:35:54.660 --> 01:36:00.740]   uh you could send recipes you could send carrot i guess we'll let you send snarky weather forecasts
[01:36:01.940 --> 01:36:08.500]   or those are bots these are bots some of them right bot like yeah they'll respond to the
[01:36:08.500 --> 01:36:13.700]   text that you input games and messages oh you could actually do words with friends inside of a
[01:36:13.700 --> 01:36:20.660]   message word with text friends you know what the what oh that's cool you could play word with
[01:36:20.660 --> 01:36:29.140]   friends and messages whoa that's kind of a neat way to do it yeah when you look at line or we chat
[01:36:29.140 --> 01:36:33.860]   they've really made messaging apps into a platform and this is a smart move because that was the
[01:36:33.860 --> 01:36:38.260]   underlying infrastructure but to be competitive you have to be where people are spending their time
[01:36:38.260 --> 01:36:43.060]   yeah that's that's happening everywhere uh one of the big features of uh one of the big features
[01:36:43.060 --> 01:36:47.380]   that uh that google has coming up with their messaging app is again the idea of having an actual
[01:36:47.380 --> 01:36:52.180]   live private agent that you can talk to and bring into the discussion to say find us a restaurant
[01:36:52.180 --> 01:36:55.780]   like this and then it'll book the table for you automatically it's it's an acknowledgement that
[01:36:55.780 --> 01:37:01.460]   all these big players they have been tri trailing behind and not keeping up with what people are
[01:37:01.460 --> 01:37:06.900]   actually using these messaging apps for and then security is wonderful but stickers and making it
[01:37:06.900 --> 01:37:11.460]   more being able to be more expressive and more human and how you communicate with your friends is
[01:37:11.460 --> 01:37:16.900]   even better super mario run stickers look i can make myself mario there was funny to me is that
[01:37:16.900 --> 01:37:20.740]   there's two very different apples at work here the the app part of it is a very progressive
[01:37:20.740 --> 01:37:25.300]   forward thinking cool apple that's exactly where the market is but the bubble effects and screen
[01:37:25.300 --> 01:37:29.140]   effects are sort of like your dad trying to make snapchat because the secret of snapchat is those
[01:37:29.140 --> 01:37:33.860]   filters are always being updated every week every day right there's new filters if i send you the
[01:37:33.860 --> 01:37:38.660]   unce unce unce lasers once you'll find it funny the third time you'll want to end me right like a
[01:37:38.660 --> 01:37:43.540]   week from now there and apple's not gonna update i mean those can update every every what quarter
[01:37:43.540 --> 01:37:48.740]   maybe but most likely every year uh there's just there's just not enough screen effects or enough
[01:37:48.740 --> 01:37:55.220]   flexibility for them they even have retro emojis if you're too lazy to type them in you can do all the
[01:37:55.220 --> 01:38:03.780]   weird asky emojis as if you knew what you were saying this is uh i'm actually kind of blown away
[01:38:03.780 --> 01:38:10.580]   by the ecosystem available at launch clearly people think this is going to be so many stickers so
[01:38:10.580 --> 01:38:18.100]   so many and games and all right well you know what because it's it's nothing it's a it's a empty
[01:38:18.100 --> 01:38:22.180]   box without apps no one's not no one's going to figure out why it's a good idea unless they have
[01:38:22.180 --> 01:38:25.860]   actually apps are working well it's going to make people cry is that disney is going to get three
[01:38:25.860 --> 01:38:30.180]   dollars for every sticker pack when a developer can't make a fantastic app i know every sticker apps
[01:38:30.180 --> 01:38:34.660]   are really expensive i thought i thought i thought it was i thought it was significant that among all
[01:38:34.660 --> 01:38:40.420]   of the big deal uh uh announcements then that all amongst all the numbers that they usually give at
[01:38:40.420 --> 01:38:46.020]   a big keynote they a lot of proud things about the app store but i think this one the first times they
[01:38:46.020 --> 01:38:50.740]   didn't mention how much money the app store is generating because i maybe part of it is that they
[01:38:50.740 --> 01:38:56.020]   recognize that a lot of developers find that as a source spot saying that it's like it's like when
[01:38:56.020 --> 01:39:01.300]   a political candidate talks about how much money he or she has given to charity saying yeah but how
[01:39:01.300 --> 01:39:06.820]   how many of those are political action committees for for your party and for your candidate as
[01:39:06.820 --> 01:39:14.420]   opposed to the eighteen dollars you gave to that one cancer charity right wow so according uh to
[01:39:14.420 --> 01:39:19.780]   the new york times apple is rethinking uh self-driving cars there have even been layoffs
[01:39:19.780 --> 01:39:27.300]   what do you think this is a dyesuke waka by ashi and brian x chin reporting in the times
[01:39:27.300 --> 01:39:32.980]   it's i mean it's hard it's it's so hard because like this is a secret project that everybody is
[01:39:32.980 --> 01:39:36.980]   talking about and right right it's one of those things where apple when they say that there's a
[01:39:36.980 --> 01:39:40.900]   thousand nose for every s they they absolutely mean it there are so many people who have seen apple
[01:39:40.900 --> 01:39:46.180]   television sets and yet that is not a product that exists and in order to make a car it is a huge
[01:39:46.180 --> 01:39:51.380]   huge experiment and you course correct during those experiments and there's a lot of things that
[01:39:51.380 --> 01:39:56.420]   are going on during that that has very little to do with a car and it sounds like apple has
[01:39:56.420 --> 01:40:01.940]   refocused this project and it's hard to tell whether that is a refinement of vision or an
[01:40:01.940 --> 01:40:06.820]   abandonment of future potential you know that sort of you have to trust apple executives to do that
[01:40:06.820 --> 01:40:11.060]   but it's sort of like if we had the system we had now back when apple was making the iphone
[01:40:11.060 --> 01:40:15.460]   it would be project purple apple is working on tablet apple adjust course abandons tablet
[01:40:15.460 --> 01:40:21.380]   goes into phone oh linux phone falters tony fidel on the outs now you know macOS phone is
[01:40:21.380 --> 01:40:25.940]   proceeding forward and like we would have seen all this sort of sausage being made in exactly the
[01:40:25.940 --> 01:40:31.540]   same way so i mean i feel really badly for everyone involved in it but this is how apple makes products
[01:40:31.540 --> 01:40:37.540]   i do feel doubly bad for it because it's apple obviously has never confirmed this project but
[01:40:37.540 --> 01:40:45.380]   you can see the flow of high energy highly successful high operating people from hugely
[01:40:45.380 --> 01:40:52.340]   successful careers at huge companies in the auto industry into apple and working on a
[01:40:52.340 --> 01:40:58.340]   prog program that apple is not even acknowledging exists so it's possible and this is just conjecture
[01:40:58.340 --> 01:41:03.940]   but just a state an example it's possible that the pitch that apple gave them that gave
[01:41:03.940 --> 01:41:09.060]   made them leave a senior position at an all maker was that we want to make an electric car that
[01:41:09.060 --> 01:41:13.300]   absolutely solves transportation problems that everybody will want to have this will be a hybrid
[01:41:13.300 --> 01:41:17.540]   between a bicycle and a and a 50 mile device and we're going to change the world with it
[01:41:17.540 --> 01:41:22.020]   and that's the project they signed on for but now they're thinking that maybe we should start to
[01:41:22.020 --> 01:41:27.300]   create fleet solutions or maybe we should even start to create power plants for trucks or maybe
[01:41:27.300 --> 01:41:32.340]   we just want to create system software that allows cars to talk to each other no matter who how makes
[01:41:32.340 --> 01:41:38.100]   them and now it's a software program program not a car program and now this person left 30 years at
[01:41:38.100 --> 01:41:43.460]   this company and now he is simply a consultant in the bay area who knows something about cars and
[01:41:43.460 --> 01:41:48.900]   this is this is nothing unique google also had supposedly a few months ago a major shake up of
[01:41:48.900 --> 01:41:54.900]   their car division whatever it is uh with a lot of people leaving a lot of people being moved around
[01:41:54.900 --> 01:41:59.060]   there are a lot of no matter how big these companies are they don't know yet where that
[01:41:59.060 --> 01:42:06.100]   opportunity is only that it's somewhere involved in moving people from a to b and so the difference
[01:42:06.100 --> 01:42:12.820]   is that i guess apple gets apple can get complaints about this uh it's the difference between how
[01:42:12.820 --> 01:42:18.260]   google does things and how apple does things at least google will have two years of here's here's
[01:42:18.260 --> 01:42:22.580]   what we're doing with cars and here's the demonstration of our self-driving car and here's the second
[01:42:22.580 --> 01:42:27.620]   iteration of our self-driving car and whoops now we have news reports that are for the first time a
[01:42:27.620 --> 01:42:33.220]   self-driving car was responsible for an accident on an open public road uh it's it's i always often
[01:42:33.220 --> 01:42:39.140]   think about it as the difference between uh nasa's race to the moon and the soviet unions race to the
[01:42:39.140 --> 01:42:45.060]   moon where nasa every time they blew up an atlas rocket it was on it was on television there was
[01:42:45.060 --> 01:42:51.540]   film because it was a live event whereas uh uh the soviet union lost their kit lost their ticket to
[01:42:51.540 --> 01:43:00.580]   the moon with two immense titanic explosions that were just awesome in terms of the the biblical
[01:43:00.580 --> 01:43:06.740]   definition of it not in terms of being wonderful but spiring fear and awe and none of those explosions
[01:43:06.740 --> 01:43:10.900]   officially happened then officially they were never going to the moon at all they could cancel
[01:43:10.900 --> 01:43:16.420]   it and say that what space program yes i alexi is now moving alexi was not moving was not working on
[01:43:16.420 --> 01:43:22.020]   anything for six years now he's back in the navy with no explanation for why he would not advance
[01:43:22.020 --> 01:43:28.660]   in the rights for six years so it really really fun time to be an engineer i think yeah uh let's
[01:43:28.660 --> 01:43:33.140]   uh let's take a break and you can do your picks of the week how about that go for sticker packs
[01:43:33.140 --> 01:43:38.100]   all sticker packs all the time i just down with like 50 oh more breaking new leo sorry pokemon go
[01:43:38.100 --> 01:43:42.740]   update is out you can now walk around with your buddy and get more candy walk around with your
[01:43:42.740 --> 01:43:47.860]   buddy and you can have a buddy snorlax and get one snorlax candy for every five kilometers you walk
[01:43:47.860 --> 01:43:52.740]   oh that's what i have to walk five kilometers well it depends depends like the more rare and
[01:43:52.740 --> 01:43:57.540]   powerful the more the longer you have to walk so some are one kilometer some are five kilometers
[01:43:57.540 --> 01:44:02.980]   is anybody some or two kilometers one goes still so the worst but the best worst part of the keynote
[01:44:02.980 --> 01:44:06.980]   that apple did is when the founders of pokemon go the anti came up on stage and they said imagine
[01:44:06.980 --> 01:44:11.140]   like in an event like this a snorlax suddenly appears yeah i thought that was fun every reporter
[01:44:11.140 --> 01:44:16.100]   every analyst next to me raced for their phones did they really it might be real and then like next
[01:44:16.100 --> 01:44:22.180]   to me this this famous analyst goes it's a lie the snorlax is a lie and just we all got trolled
[01:44:22.180 --> 01:44:26.500]   this snorlax is a lie and then Jim Ren back out said focus class
[01:44:26.500 --> 01:44:32.660]   they were worried that if like a snorlax or a dragonite appeared they have one which is run out
[01:44:32.660 --> 01:44:38.260]   of the apathy is are those really rare yeah yeah there was like uh there have been a lot of
[01:44:38.260 --> 01:44:42.580]   police reports like in taiwan even in montreal when a rare pluckinman appears and like 200 people flood
[01:44:42.580 --> 01:44:49.060]   the streets how does the word get out i don't know i think there's the viral social networking
[01:44:49.060 --> 01:44:53.540]   thing maybe there's messages apps or some these kids use something these kids today
[01:44:53.540 --> 01:44:59.380]   a while well i'm hey hey knock it off i'm not playing pokemon go right now
[01:44:59.380 --> 01:45:07.460]   a wild and he has been captured well i just happen to see a tengela there and they
[01:45:08.020 --> 01:45:11.940]   we you know we're kind of sad because we used to be right across the street from a
[01:45:11.940 --> 01:45:17.140]   a pokey stop but now we are across the street from one but it's just a little too far to reach
[01:45:17.140 --> 01:45:24.580]   so i guess i don't have the update i was just i was hey i was doing my job checking for an update
[01:45:24.580 --> 01:45:28.100]   there's so many after updates right now everybody's updating for i always that's right i've noticed
[01:45:28.100 --> 01:45:33.460]   that last couple of days have been quite busy and all the map apps are out the syria apps are out the
[01:45:34.340 --> 01:45:39.780]   as soon as apps are out i'm gonna put boy i'm gonna spend my afternoon getting messages apps on here
[01:45:39.780 --> 01:45:44.500]   it's exciting the old iphone but i'm just gonna right i've just back it up and then
[01:45:44.500 --> 01:45:47.780]   restored on the new one yeah and then dynamic and they're collaborative i thought that was a
[01:45:47.780 --> 01:45:51.860]   really clever part is that you can interact with each other and you do things like food orders
[01:45:51.860 --> 01:45:58.660]   and pretty amazing so the bot the bot story is a little different on messages than from like
[01:45:58.660 --> 01:46:03.300]   right it's not it's not an active assistant it's more like an app that you can access from within
[01:46:03.300 --> 01:46:07.940]   the app okay and of course it's going to vary from app to app but the idea of immediately
[01:46:07.940 --> 01:46:13.060]   making this new platform opened up to third parties and saying please help make this platform
[01:46:13.060 --> 01:46:17.060]   awesome because really the chat app is like the home screen now and it's like the lock screen it
[01:46:17.060 --> 01:46:23.220]   really is a point of access to user installed apps and it's just where people tend to live these days
[01:46:23.220 --> 01:46:27.860]   so really to app work is going to be the toughest thing to get used to in iOS 10
[01:46:27.860 --> 01:46:32.740]   the home button is going to start off because you no longer swipe to unlock slight unlock you
[01:46:32.740 --> 01:46:36.980]   now press the home button at first people will mispress it or they want like when you get used to it
[01:46:36.980 --> 01:46:40.900]   it just unlocks and goes to the home right away actually how it should have been it's much much
[01:46:40.900 --> 01:46:44.340]   better yeah but at the beginning you can press it twice and get apple pay and then like i did i
[01:46:44.340 --> 01:46:48.500]   press it it was what yeah and then the lock screen is spatially different because the cameras on one
[01:46:48.500 --> 01:46:52.180]   side the widgets are on the other so there's a little bit of orientation to get used to and i've
[01:46:52.180 --> 01:46:57.700]   been mostly using using the beta on my ipad mini and i just really didn't notice much of a difference
[01:46:57.700 --> 01:47:01.140]   just nothing but nice little user refinements i think it's going to be one of the nicest
[01:47:01.140 --> 01:47:09.300]   most gentlest on the brain upgrades ever and sierra's next week the 20th 20th one one week from today
[01:47:09.300 --> 01:47:14.100]   just a program note i will not be here one week today i'll be in paris
[01:47:14.100 --> 01:47:23.220]   why must for you i must leo always get the fuzzy under the wall
[01:47:23.220 --> 01:47:28.420]   send your pledges to if only i'd had my ceramic watch
[01:47:29.380 --> 01:47:32.820]   then everything would be wonderful you wouldn't have to take it off
[01:47:32.820 --> 01:47:38.180]   for security because it would not set anything else amazing it is like your ceramic gun that
[01:47:38.180 --> 01:47:43.940]   you're not talking about so but the show will go on of course and uh i'm not sure which of you
[01:47:43.940 --> 01:47:48.100]   guys is hosting it or if somebody hears hosting it but i think we're trading off i know i'm hosting
[01:47:48.100 --> 01:47:54.100]   it yes week not next week will be good after okay it'll be it'll be just it'll be better you won't
[01:47:54.100 --> 01:48:02.100]   have that negative nelly leo to it was honest p in your rule and conversational apple by the way
[01:48:02.100 --> 01:48:06.180]   has patented its planter
[01:48:06.180 --> 01:48:15.380]   though you may say oh it's a digital planner no you may say is it a smart planner no
[01:48:16.260 --> 01:48:24.980]   it is just a container to hold a plant it happens to be the container to hold a plant that they're
[01:48:24.980 --> 01:48:32.740]   using at the new apple store in san francisco you know the new forested heavily forested apple store
[01:48:32.740 --> 01:48:37.300]   they've even patented how they arrange the trees
[01:48:40.180 --> 01:48:48.820]   this is what happens when you have attorneys on retainer so just just just be happy that when

[01:50:34.900 --> 01:50:42.260]   ye 4k action camera yeah we were talking about sometimes you buy things to review because it's
[01:50:42.260 --> 01:50:46.740]   faster this is something I bought I've been kind of also because I've been looking to sort of add
[01:50:46.740 --> 01:50:52.340]   like an action camera to a modern action camera to my stable for a while there are a lot of like
[01:50:53.140 --> 01:50:58.660]   overseas made knockoffs of the GoPro camera and they cost like 50 to 80 dollars and they behave
[01:50:58.660 --> 01:51:04.500]   like knockoffs this is nothing like that this is a really beautifully built it costs $250
[01:51:04.500 --> 01:51:12.100]   it is a it costs it it's a 4k camera that can go all the way down to I think 230 frames per second
[01:51:12.100 --> 01:51:18.260]   at 720p it has a built-in Wi-Fi built-in bluetooth built-in full-color touchscreen it has a full
[01:51:18.260 --> 01:51:24.180]   touch interface on the back so it's really really easy to change settings and operate
[01:51:24.180 --> 01:51:30.020]   which is a problem that even the regular growth gopros often have it is I'm sorry I thought that
[01:51:30.020 --> 01:51:35.540]   I had it on the desk it is actually in my bag somewhere because it's been in my bag every all the time
[01:51:35.540 --> 01:51:40.340]   since I got it about a month ago but one thing one of the many things I like about it is that
[01:51:40.340 --> 01:51:44.980]   it really is designed to be the sort of camera that I would like to have in my bag at all times
[01:51:44.980 --> 01:51:49.860]   it's not it's you don't have to you can of course put it inside a waterproof case and it will go
[01:51:49.860 --> 01:51:55.540]   down to 50 meters just like your regular action cams but you can also buy a beautiful like $20
[01:51:55.540 --> 01:52:00.900]   leather-rette form-fitting case for it and just carry it around like a regular camera it has a tripod
[01:52:00.900 --> 01:52:05.540]   mount built into it so you don't have to put it in that big huge bubble case and then screw it
[01:52:05.540 --> 01:52:09.940]   into a special thing to use it with a tripod I actually have it in a little vest pocket sized
[01:52:09.940 --> 01:52:16.100]   case the house has a tiny little tripod and a tiny little charging cable on it it will operate
[01:52:16.100 --> 01:52:23.300]   the battery lasts a lot longer than the GoPro battery does it lasts about two hours shooting
[01:52:23.300 --> 01:52:34.500]   1080p HD video it has three-axis stabilization it has a full gyro on it the photos on it look
[01:52:34.500 --> 01:52:40.580]   exceptional I often I was in New York for some meetings and briefings last week and I found
[01:52:40.580 --> 01:52:46.100]   myself just carrying it around as a super wide angle and fun to carry around camera I was taking
[01:52:46.100 --> 01:52:51.060]   pictures with it all the time just as a regular still camera in addition to being able to shoot
[01:52:51.060 --> 01:52:58.020]   video and audio with it and again it's full 4k HD and the thing I like about it is that it's not
[01:52:58.020 --> 01:53:02.900]   designed to be a dumb little just push a button and take a picture camera it will work that way
[01:53:02.900 --> 01:53:09.700]   if you want to but you can also choose multiple even within 4k video for instance you can choose
[01:53:09.700 --> 01:53:14.180]   do you want it to be high quality 4k video like high bit rate video or do you want to maximize
[01:53:14.180 --> 01:53:19.060]   storage in the camera still camera for instance you can say I want to overexpose it a little bit
[01:53:19.060 --> 01:53:25.060]   I want to underexpose this a little bit you can choose the ISO the phone the app that you download
[01:53:25.060 --> 01:53:32.020]   for it for iOS or Android is one of the nicest companion apps I've ever seen on a camera it's
[01:53:32.020 --> 01:53:38.580]   even better than the Olympus app that comes with my my really expensive pro quality Olympus camera
[01:53:38.580 --> 01:53:45.860]   that I absolutely love it just if the Wi-Fi is enabled is turned on on the camera it will not only
[01:53:45.860 --> 01:53:51.940]   it will and you launch the app it will find it in the Wi-Fi list of available networks and it
[01:53:51.940 --> 01:53:56.820]   will switch to it automatically so nine times out of ten you just simply tap the button say yes I
[01:53:56.820 --> 01:54:01.220]   want to connect to the camera it will find it and connect to it with no trouble whatsoever but the
[01:54:01.220 --> 01:54:06.260]   bottom line is it's an inexpensive camera it's a lot of fun to use it takes amazingly good video
[01:54:06.260 --> 01:54:13.380]   and stills and it really is just a fun thing to have in your bag at all times because no matter how
[01:54:13.380 --> 01:54:21.380]   good your your phone's camera is it's not optimized for just shooting this one thing and also when you
[01:54:21.380 --> 01:54:26.420]   have this tiny little camera in your bag it means that let's say something really cool is happening
[01:54:26.420 --> 01:54:32.500]   or even if you're just at your at your sister's house taking video of your your nieces birthday
[01:54:32.500 --> 01:54:37.780]   suddenly you remember the oh wait don't I have that camera charged up in my laptop bag you just put
[01:54:37.780 --> 01:54:42.580]   it in a corner of the kitchen as the cake is coming in and you're still shooting video with your with
[01:54:42.580 --> 01:54:47.940]   your phone but now you have a second camera that you can cut to that has the wide shot and so when
[01:54:47.940 --> 01:54:53.300]   you're making your videos it makes it much much better when I was hoping for not just as there's
[01:54:53.300 --> 01:54:59.380]   there's the reviewer side of my brain where I just think that hey non-go pro non-famous name but
[01:54:59.380 --> 01:55:03.220]   less expensive action cams are kind of a thing now I want to check a good one of those out and see
[01:55:03.220 --> 01:55:07.540]   if it's any good that's one kind of brain but there's also my consumer brain that things that I
[01:55:07.540 --> 01:55:12.260]   and you not go want and it's exactly what I want a really cool fun camera to have in my bag at all
[01:55:12.260 --> 01:55:16.820]   times but I could recharge from this my my phone charger I won't need to take like another power
[01:55:16.820 --> 01:55:22.740]   brick another power adapter charger and I could not be happier with that purchase if I don't if I
[01:55:22.740 --> 01:55:27.140]   were forbidden to write a review of this I'd still be happy that I just bought this really cool thing
[01:55:27.140 --> 01:55:31.300]   that makes me very happy the only I will say there's only one downside to it and is that
[01:55:31.300 --> 01:55:38.020]   you're used to buying a GoPro camera and it comes with the underwater mount and this one that's an
[01:55:38.020 --> 01:55:43.540]   add-on it costs it's gonna cost you 40 30 or 40 smackers to buy the plastic housing for this
[01:55:43.540 --> 01:55:50.180]   but that's kind of okay because it's durable enough as it is and if you're not mounting it on a bike
[01:55:50.180 --> 01:55:56.740]   if you're not taking it underwater if you're not using it for at the splash park maybe you're
[01:55:56.740 --> 01:56:01.700]   okay with the idea that instead of being charged $300 for a kit that included a housing that's
[01:56:01.700 --> 01:56:06.340]   for you would be nice to have but you don't necessarily need you were able to simply save 40
[01:56:06.340 --> 01:56:11.620]   bucks then buy that housing at a later date when you decided that it was an opportune time but
[01:56:11.620 --> 01:56:16.100]   like I said yee action cam 4k they have a for the original version they released last year is just
[01:56:16.100 --> 01:56:21.780]   1080p that one costs about 75 or 80 bucks I don't really think they found their sweet spot with it
[01:56:21.780 --> 01:56:27.700]   with that one it's definitely this $250 one though the 4k version definitely worth my strong
[01:56:27.700 --> 01:56:34.660]   recommendation I apologize because you provided us with a video and I neglected to download it
[01:56:34.660 --> 01:56:43.220]   but I'm downloading it right now the sunset rocks boats yes this I was scrambling to find something
[01:56:43.220 --> 01:56:48.660]   something that's really I've been mostly using it to take pretty videos so that it that is locked
[01:56:48.660 --> 01:56:56.740]   off on a tripod and yes that is chosen to be the good place to take almost almost a fraudulently
[01:56:56.740 --> 01:57:03.460]   good phone or video demo which is go to a scenic sunset scenic place at sunset and but the detail
[01:57:03.460 --> 01:57:09.300]   is amazing like I was saying earlier if you don't think that you will ever if you don't have a 4k TV
[01:57:10.100 --> 01:57:14.420]   and so you're not interested in getting a 4k camera that might not be the reason why you'd
[01:57:14.420 --> 01:57:19.220]   want to get it it means that if I wanted to take that from a wide shot of that rock to a somewhat
[01:57:19.220 --> 01:57:25.860]   tight shot I could take one quarter of that that video screen and turn it into a tight shot it would
[01:57:25.860 --> 01:57:31.700]   be 1080 and the detail would be as good as what I'd expect to get from an action camera at 1080 yeah
[01:57:31.700 --> 01:57:36.020]   and that's that's it's also people will wonder my god you had like a you had a really
[01:57:36.020 --> 01:57:42.260]   complicated rig on a motorized zoom that no I had a 4k camera it was it was shooting a wide shot and
[01:57:42.260 --> 01:57:48.420]   then in iMovie I just used the the Ken Burns effect to slowly pan and zoom to where I wanted to go
[01:57:48.420 --> 01:57:54.420]   a 4k camera gives you so many creative options that I really wish I had it when I shot my cousin's
[01:57:54.420 --> 01:57:59.460]   wedding a few months ago because I would have looked really much better it is it is on Amazon
[01:58:00.100 --> 01:58:06.580]   available for 250 bucks it's what it's one of those companies that saves money by not actually
[01:58:06.580 --> 01:58:10.820]   dealing but by basically selling everything directly right so they use Amazon as their regular
[01:58:10.820 --> 01:58:15.780]   seller if you want to buy it with PayPal you can also they have an official store on eBay
[01:58:15.780 --> 01:58:21.220]   and curiously enough when you buy I bought the camera off of through Amazon and then I bought the
[01:58:21.220 --> 01:58:28.820]   I bought the housing from eBay oddly enough it shipped through Amazon in an Amazon box so no
[01:58:28.820 --> 01:58:32.100]   matter how you want to pay for it no matter where you're buying stuff you will be able to get it
[01:58:32.100 --> 01:58:40.500]   strangely enough I'm looking at it on Amazon and somebody just bought it with a selfie stick so
[01:58:40.500 --> 01:58:46.500]   they have they have kits expect a lot of bad selfies of me on this uh
[01:58:46.500 --> 01:58:53.380]   you sold me Andy that's pretty cool that's pretty cool yeah
[01:58:55.300 --> 01:58:59.860]   yee I've seen a lot of very inexpensive yee security cameras a lot
[01:58:59.860 --> 01:59:04.340]   this is this must be a Chinese company they're just taking the world by storming
[01:59:04.340 --> 01:59:09.140]   they're like Amazon basics like anchor there are companies that figure out that if we don't
[01:59:09.140 --> 01:59:12.980]   spend money on marketing if you don't spend money getting into the retail the traditional
[01:59:12.980 --> 01:59:17.300]   retail challenge if we just say we're going to try to make the best product possible at the
[01:59:17.300 --> 01:59:22.900]   lowest reasonable price to get there and then over the course of a couple years you realize that
[01:59:22.900 --> 01:59:28.340]   oh the the name or this name is actually associated with good stuff yeah like I said I'm sorry they
[01:59:28.340 --> 01:59:33.860]   don't have it with me but it really does feel like a four hundred dollar device it doesn't feel
[01:59:33.860 --> 01:59:38.260]   like a knockoff of anything it really is its own thing as I said couldn't be happy with it thank
[01:59:38.260 --> 01:59:45.700]   you for the recommendation mr. Renee Richie you're pick of the week so I have two things to recommend
[01:59:45.700 --> 01:59:50.580]   and both for similar reasons as we know the iPhone 7 is famously ditched the 3.5 millimeter
[01:59:50.580 --> 01:59:54.500]   headphone jack and that's fine for people who want to just listen to iPhone headphones or
[01:59:54.500 --> 01:59:59.220]   going to use bluetooth headphones but there's a group of people people who have low vision or
[01:59:59.220 --> 02:00:04.740]   no vision who need to use the headphones as primary input devices they need to be listening all the
[02:00:04.740 --> 02:00:08.740]   time and that means that they will almost certainly have to be charging at the same time that they're
[02:00:08.740 --> 02:00:14.980]   listening so for them there's two options currently one is a is a dongle that belkin worked on with
[02:00:14.980 --> 02:00:20.020]   apple that basically is similar to the original dongle but has double lightning on it so you can
[02:00:20.020 --> 02:00:24.580]   plug that into your iPhone plug the lightning cable to charge into one side the lightning earbuds on
[02:00:24.580 --> 02:00:28.900]   the other side and then you can just listen while you are charging without any trouble and if you
[02:00:28.900 --> 02:00:32.740]   have to listen all day every day that's fine if you walk around with your headphones in literally
[02:00:32.740 --> 02:00:38.980]   all day totally fine the second is apples blue sorry is apples dock for the iPhone and it's
[02:00:38.980 --> 02:00:44.180]   it's the same dock as last year but there's a new space black color now sorry jet black color now
[02:00:44.180 --> 02:00:48.500]   actually I think it's matte black I apologize there's so many blacks it's a it is a new matte black
[02:00:48.500 --> 02:00:53.380]   color now that goes with the new black iPhone but either way it's got lightning out to the iPhone
[02:00:53.380 --> 02:00:58.020]   and it's got 3.5 millimeter headphone jacks out so if you're sitting at your desk or at your bedside
[02:00:58.020 --> 02:01:02.820]   table and you want to use your headphones your iPhone can charge merrily away on the dock and
[02:01:02.820 --> 02:01:07.060]   you can listen to your headphones for as long as you want so again you know for some people it's
[02:01:07.060 --> 02:01:10.820]   going to be a nice to have for some people especially with accessibility issues it's going to be a
[02:01:10.820 --> 02:01:15.060]   must-have but these are two of your options so far and of course if you want you can get blue
[02:01:15.060 --> 02:01:21.220]   tooth headphones and just use those while they're plugged in yeah and I think really the the long
[02:01:21.220 --> 02:01:28.900]   term goal for apples go portless go all wireless right yeah and again it makes me wish well people
[02:01:28.900 --> 02:01:33.940]   who charge all people who need to have your phones in all the time are are not like you know it's a
[02:01:33.940 --> 02:01:39.220]   special case yeah a special case that absolutely has to be taken care of yeah I agree 100% and of course
[02:01:39.220 --> 02:01:44.580]   phasing out the lightning port which i'm sure apple would love to do is problematic because you
[02:01:44.580 --> 02:01:50.100]   have to be wireless charging yeah i don't really i can't i can't imagine how drunk they'd have to be
[02:01:50.100 --> 02:01:53.620]   inside that we're gonna put over radio we're gonna put another uh we're gonna make room for
[02:01:53.620 --> 02:01:58.420]   wireless charging pad but look but look i wasn't aware of this uh belton device but does make me
[02:01:58.420 --> 02:02:03.460]   think that if some company like belkin were to create a mobile dock just something that extends
[02:02:03.460 --> 02:02:10.340]   the length of the iphone seven by god forbid one centimeter and makes restores it basically just
[02:02:10.340 --> 02:02:15.220]   has a a headphone jack at one end lightning port at the other end is sponsoring possibly make it so
[02:02:15.220 --> 02:02:21.780]   that if i want to have a quasi permanently installed headphone jack i would be i would still complain
[02:02:21.780 --> 02:02:27.700]   about it but after 30 bucks i'd forget about it my pick of the week is just a reminder that now
[02:02:27.700 --> 02:02:31.860]   that you have ios 10 to run and not walk but run and get switched playgrounds it doesn't come
[02:02:31.860 --> 02:02:35.460]   automatically with ios 10 but now you could finally use it i've been playing with it we've
[02:02:35.460 --> 02:02:40.740]   all been playing with it with the beta it's just fantastic and i actually i'm thrilled to have it
[02:02:40.740 --> 02:02:44.580]   on my trip because i think i it's the kind of thing i might just kind of mess around with
[02:02:44.580 --> 02:02:52.580]   um you know spend some time with and uh there and are there yet uh i haven't looked um third party
[02:02:52.580 --> 02:02:57.300]   playgrounds available i think they probably will be soon if they aren't already right now it's
[02:02:57.300 --> 02:03:01.140]   content available from apple you can personally exchange like you can air drop them back and forth
[02:03:01.140 --> 02:03:04.980]   and send them back and forth but right now the store stuff is filled with the lessons from apple
[02:03:04.980 --> 02:03:10.100]   there's not a market yet okay no i bet there will be i wouldn't be surprised to see playgrounds
[02:03:10.100 --> 02:03:13.620]   on github and elsewhere that you could yeah and i think schools too because teachers can
[02:03:13.620 --> 02:03:17.220]   design their own that's the playground books and those are going to be incredible learning tools
[02:03:17.220 --> 02:03:21.780]   yeah yeah and remember that we at apple had a big push for their own uh here's how you design
[02:03:21.780 --> 02:03:25.780]   your own textbooks for i books author creator when's the last time we heard about that yep
[02:03:25.780 --> 02:03:29.780]   i thought it's a it's a great demo so i hope it takes off because i hope it's a quite nice book yeah
