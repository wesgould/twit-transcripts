[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.800]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly, Lori Gill and Renee Ritchie.
[00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:05.880]   They're back from WWDC.
[00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:07.720]   Andy Inako's back in the library.
[00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:11.640]   We're going to talk about all the things Apple announced last week at
[00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:13.440]   Lori and Renee's take on it.
[00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:15.900]   The big Mac, the cheese grater.
[00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:16.280]   How much?
[00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:17.760]   We'll play a little prices right.
[00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.520]   How much do you think the final maxed out price will be?
[00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:24.960]   We'll also talk about some surprising new features in iOS.
[00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.160]   There's a lot to talk about and it's all coming up next on Mac Break Weekly.

[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:37.120]   Renee Richie back in town from his jaunt to the McHenry Center in San Jose.
[00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:38.160]   Welcome back Renee.
[00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:40.560]   Hi, Emilio and I'm all dubbed up for you.
[00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.240]   I love that. Did you get the jacket too?
[00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.240]   Yes, I got the, except I got the black on black jacket.
[00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:47.520]   I didn't get one of the fun, the fun-
[00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.360]   I think black on black though is the one getting the most money on eBay right now.
[00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:52.080]   Oh, is it?
[00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:52.400]   Yeah.
[00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:54.160]   Because it's cool.
[00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:56.320]   Renee, you were complaining about it.
[00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:58.320]   Like eight or nine hundred dollars, dude.
[00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:59.520]   Wow.
[00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.920]   Oh, okay, now I'm going to reassess everything, Leo.
[00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:02.320]   Okay.
[00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:05.280]   Because other people like it better, I am now going to change my outlook online.
[00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.360]   That's Laurie Gill.
[00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:11.840]   Who is also there in San Jose, managing editor of iMore.
[00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:12.640]   Hello, Laurie.
[00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:16.160]   Hi, I did get a dubbed up shirt, but I didn't get the jacket.
[00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.720]   How did you not?
[00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:17.920]   Oh, because you didn't have tickets?
[00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:19.200]   No.
[00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.040]   I thought everybody got the jacket.
[00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:22.000]   I had to sneak in.
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.360]   Oh, you snuck in.
[00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:24.000]   Yeah, we had.
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:24.720]   I was at the keynote.
[00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:27.360]   I was able to go to the keynote, but I wasn't able to go to the press.
[00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:27.520]   Oh, you were a press.
[00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:28.640]   That's why you weren't.
[00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:29.120]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:29.680]   Exactly.
[00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:33.040]   Also, Annie and Akko, who like me, stayed home.
[00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:34.240]   Hello, Andrew.
[00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:39.280]   Well, well, I didn't know back then that it was possible to make WWDC revenue positive
[00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:41.360]   by just selling the stuff you get for free.
[00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:42.960]   That seems like a bad thing.
[00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:44.400]   That changes everything.
[00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:45.360]   I wouldn't want to get it.
[00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:48.000]   Also, just quick story, but also you have scholar.
[00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:52.000]   Also, just to go ahead, I'm sorry.
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.680]   No, I was going to say they had scholarship students and they began an underground discord
[00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:01.360]   network for the pins because the Tim Cook pin and the Black Flag pirate ship pin were highly
[00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:02.080]   sought after.
[00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:04.800]   So everywhere you went, the scholarship guys were in discord trying to find all the different
[00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:05.200]   pins.
[00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:05.680]   It was amazing.
[00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:11.440]   Here's a 2019 limited edition attendee jacket with pins.
[00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:15.200]   It's the blue one by it now $799.
[00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:16.720]   Oh, no.
[00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:21.600]   Yeah, I feel like I could spend $700 more productively than that.
[00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:23.680]   Oh, but these jackets are so cool.
[00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:24.320]   Look at that.
[00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:29.920]   But I do have to say that my usual excuse doesn't work quite as well because I used to be able to
[00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:34.880]   say, "Well, yeah, I could either spend like the $13, $1400 to fly out there and get a hotel,
[00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:39.360]   plus the $1,600 to actually attend or smug modon.
[00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:43.600]   I could just stay home and then buy the new Mac Pro, essentially for free,
[00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:48.400]   and now that I can't possibly buy a new Mac Pro for twice when I would be spending to go to
[00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:49.840]   WBC.
[00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:51.760]   Now I've got no choice but to, you know,
[00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:53.440]   I don't know those hotel prices, Andy.
[00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:55.600]   The hotel prices, right?
[00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:56.560]   No joke this year.
[00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:57.920]   Yeah.
[00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:59.040]   It's pretty good.
[00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:00.640]   Here is.
[00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:02.000]   Come to San Diego is cheap.
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:02.400]   They said.
[00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:04.480]   This is the black and space gray.
[00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:06.000]   I think that's the one you got, right?
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:06.640]   Yeah.
[00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:07.760]   $950.
[00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:10.400]   Well, it is the Batman option.
[00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:12.160]   It's stealth.
[00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:13.520]   It's stealth.
[00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:15.040]   Reversible black.
[00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:17.040]   It's pattern disruptive.
[00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:22.640]   It's like the skin they put on like pre-production cars so they can take them out on the rope without
[00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:23.520]   people photographing them.
[00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:28.720]   We had somebody in studio last week who had, well, I showed it actually on the show,
[00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:29.520]   who had the jacket.
[00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:30.320]   It's pretty sweet.
[00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:31.040]   It's pretty nice.
[00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:31.360]   Yeah.
[00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:31.680]   I would say.
[00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:31.840]   Yeah.
[00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:35.920]   The fact that it's reversible, they can like fresh Prince of Bel-Air it.
[00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:38.160]   That impressed me.
[00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:40.880]   I don't know what that means but I'm sure it's important.
[00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:47.040]   It's a safe, it's a born and raised playground is where I spent most of my days.
[00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:51.840]   Is Uncle Phil got him into like that's that snooty prep school and then he thought like the
[00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:54.080]   uniform jacket was like not flashy enough.
[00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:58.640]   So he started wearing it inside out so that the satin red inside was the outside.
[00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:00.080]   So that's what I'm sorry.
[00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:03.200]   So that's ever since I refer to that as fresh printing at home.
[00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:04.880]   I'm probably the only one.
[00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:07.120]   And now I don't realize it.
[00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:11.920]   Of course we spent a lot of time last week talking about WWDC.
[00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:16.000]   I am on record saying it was very exciting.
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:17.760]   I felt like Apple listened.
[00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:19.120]   I'm not alone.
[00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:21.760]   Marco Arment wrote a column saying Apple is listening.
[00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:24.560]   In fact, that was the title of his column.
[00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:25.200]   Call him and he is.
[00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:27.680]   It was the first time I couldn't type as fast as Craig was talking.
[00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:29.520]   Lori and I were just looking at each other going slow down.
[00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:30.480]   Hold on that slide.
[00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:31.440]   What did he just say?
[00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:34.800]   And we literally we've done this for like 10 years Leo and this is literally the first
[00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:36.160]   time I could not keep up with them.
[00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:43.200]   I think Marco had kind of the same reaction I did which is that Apple has really let the Mac
[00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:46.320]   drift.
[00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:48.880]   The Mac Pro was 2013 un-updatable.
[00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:54.240]   The MacBook Pro as Annie and I have said before with the touch bar and the keyboard
[00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:56.560]   really left a lot to be desired.
[00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:57.120]   No Mac mini updates.
[00:05:57.120 --> 00:05:58.560]   No MacBook Air updates.
[00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:00.720]   Then all of a sudden they update the Mac Mini.
[00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:06.720]   They update the and now the Mac Pro and Marco's final sentence is Apple is listening again.
[00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:10.000]   They've still got it and the Mac is back.
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.480]   I'm optimistic for the first time in years.
[00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:13.920]   Is that the same reaction Renee?
[00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:21.680]   Yeah, I mean, I think it's been fairly evident since a year and a half ago when they started
[00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:22.800]   putting all this stuff.
[00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:24.720]   They started putting together the Pro workflow team.
[00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:29.680]   I think was not just that the Mac was back but that they started for a while.
[00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:33.200]   I think there was this famous incident where Steve Jobs walked into the Mac lab and slammed
[00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:36.160]   an iPad down the table and said, "Why can't you do this?"
[00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:40.880]   And I think that set them on a trajectory to make the Mac more appliance-like and more mainstream
[00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:46.480]   because the Mac had never had a good share of its market and the iPad dominated its market.
[00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:50.320]   And there was probably some thinking that if they just made it a little bit more like an
[00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:53.200]   appliance, a little bit more like an iPad, they could really take off.
[00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:58.800]   And they did get a lot of sales but it was at the cost of the traditional Mac market.
[00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:03.040]   And when they finally realized that, when they came to terms with that and they started
[00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:07.920]   assembling that Pro workflow team, and by the way, we all got a huge surprise walking into
[00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:13.200]   the hands-on area and seeing Dr. Wave from Pixar in his new Apple workflow team jacket
[00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:15.920]   showing off Maya and Hydra on one of these new Mac bros.
[00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:16.400]   Wow.
[00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:19.360]   I mean, they are super serious about the people they're recruiting.
[00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:22.800]   And I think that because those people are yelling at them internally, even louder than
[00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:24.240]   we are all yelling at the next journal.
[00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:27.280]   Yes, I think that's exactly right.
[00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:34.000]   Some have complained that there is a big gap between the Mac Pro at the very, very, very high end
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:38.160]   and the Mac books that maybe there needs to be something in the middle.
[00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:40.400]   But I think the iMac fits that deal.
[00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:43.680]   They go from iMac to iMac Pro to Mac Pro as their current.
[00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:45.280]   It's a fairly steady progression.
[00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:46.560]   No, Andy, you don't agree?
[00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:51.440]   No, well, because Rich Segal had a really good post, our friend, CEO,
[00:07:51.440 --> 00:07:59.040]   excuse me, the heads of a bare-bone software, had a really good post about how the sweet spot
[00:07:59.040 --> 00:08:04.080]   for developers for a lot of people who are not necessarily rendering a scene from the next
[00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:08.640]   DreamWorks movie, they just need to compile a really big app really, really quickly, or they
[00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:11.600]   need to get through a production workflow much more quickly.
[00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:15.600]   What they have historically been very, very well served by is $3,000.
[00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:19.120]   Give us a box that has user upgradable stuff in it.
[00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:22.400]   We're not necessarily saying that we need to be able to upgrade the CPU ourselves,
[00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:25.680]   that we don't necessarily need to upgrade the power supply ourselves,
[00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:30.320]   but if our needs change over the next two, three, four years,
[00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:34.000]   we need to be able to get inside there and add more storage, change out the storage,
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:37.040]   add more RAM, change out the RAM, even with the old,
[00:08:37.040 --> 00:08:42.560]   quick road-spox Mac Pro is possible to swap out the CPU for something else.
[00:08:42.560 --> 00:08:45.920]   But now that's just not possible anymore.
[00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:52.960]   The $6,000 does not make any sense whatsoever, he feels, for his uses and for a lot of other
[00:08:52.960 --> 00:08:54.880]   people in his boats uses.
[00:08:54.880 --> 00:09:00.400]   And now we no longer have that ability to say, it's okay for Apple to say,
[00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:04.800]   well, here's your Mac Mini, it can be just as powerful as the Mac Pro that you probably would
[00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:10.800]   have bought anyway. But again, it is a sealed hot plate that has minimal upgradability.
[00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:13.040]   This is not what they really, really need.
[00:09:13.040 --> 00:09:18.160]   And I do agree with Rich, I do think it's going to hurt Apple in the long run,
[00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:22.000]   release the community in the long run, if these Pro users who kind of,
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:26.480]   they're kind of like one of those gravity wells inside the user base,
[00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:29.680]   where they kind of pull the experience up for everybody,
[00:09:29.680 --> 00:09:35.040]   because the needs that they have in 2019 are close to the needs that other people are going
[00:09:35.040 --> 00:09:41.200]   to be having in 2020, 2021, and how they are interacting with their hardware,
[00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:46.320]   tends to give Apple lessons on what they're doing right, what they're doing wrong.
[00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:52.880]   So I do think that it's a really, really prominent gap in the product line that there is no $3,000
[00:09:52.880 --> 00:09:59.040]   box that is user upgradable for people who again are not people who are well served by
[00:09:59.040 --> 00:10:06.720]   a MacBook Air, but also don't have or need to spend $6,000 on a bare bones Mac Pro anymore.
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:12.800]   How does that relate to the iMac Pro though? Like if you're talking about price-wise,
[00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:18.560]   if you're talking about a $3,000 computer, like doesn't the iMac Pro suit that position?
[00:10:18.560 --> 00:10:23.440]   Well, because there you're, it's still not easy to get into, still not easy to upgrade,
[00:10:23.440 --> 00:10:31.600]   but the thing is, the argument I keep hearing is that you're making me buy,
[00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:35.920]   if this expensive display, I don't want the expensive display, I don't need the expensive
[00:10:35.920 --> 00:10:40.640]   display, why are you making me buy something I don't need? How much less expensive would the
[00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:45.760]   iMac Pro be if I didn't have to buy this to me useless monitor with it? So it's not about
[00:10:45.760 --> 00:10:50.320]   some actual performance. It's about the form factor that works for your office, for your workflow.
[00:10:50.320 --> 00:10:57.680]   And Lori, the iMac Pro starts at $5,000. So it isn't, it starts at, it's not that much less
[00:10:57.680 --> 00:11:02.480]   expensive than the Mac Pro. It does feel like there's a gap at the kind of $3,000.
[00:11:02.480 --> 00:11:06.640]   I think one of the things also is like back in the old days of the Steve Jobs quadrant,
[00:11:06.640 --> 00:11:10.080]   literally almost anybody could use almost any Mac. There was only like four of them,
[00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:13.760]   and you could feel like every new product was for you. And starting with the 12-inch,
[00:11:13.760 --> 00:11:17.760]   maybe the MacBook Air, but certainly the 12-inch MacBook, Apple started putting out products
[00:11:17.760 --> 00:11:21.520]   that weren't for everyone. And I remember like almost the crisis that my friends went through,
[00:11:21.520 --> 00:11:25.680]   and they're like, I can't use this 12-inch MacBook. And I'm like, well, there's a MacBook Pro right
[00:11:25.680 --> 00:11:30.800]   over. That's perfect for you. No, but this is the new one. And when any market matures, you start to
[00:11:30.800 --> 00:11:36.560]   segment. And absolutely, there is a gap between the Mac Mini and the Mac Pro. But previously,
[00:11:36.560 --> 00:11:41.520]   that gap was huge. And now Apple's cut it in half by probably for the first time really catering
[00:11:41.520 --> 00:11:45.760]   to the absolute highest end pros, the ones that felt perhaps the most alienated,
[00:11:45.760 --> 00:11:50.160]   who the trash can certainly didn't serve. And maybe the original cheese grater could get close
[00:11:50.160 --> 00:11:54.800]   to there, but it was never, it was never quite enough. And so they've sort of done the ultimate
[00:11:54.800 --> 00:12:01.040]   high end for like ILM and Pixar, and people in universities who need the ultimate performance,
[00:12:01.040 --> 00:12:06.000]   just everything you can possibly get. And they're not done with that Mac team yet.
[00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:10.560]   There's a new MacBook Pro on the way. And I went and I looked and I remembered my old
[00:12:10.560 --> 00:12:14.560]   ARS Technica. That might be your answer, by the way, Renee, is they're not done.
[00:12:14.560 --> 00:12:19.440]   And maybe they're, you know, people have wanted the mini tower forever, like for 10 years,
[00:12:19.440 --> 00:12:22.560]   they've been asking for Apple for the mini tower. They've never done it. But I feel like now is
[00:12:22.560 --> 00:12:26.720]   the era where they might. Right. Yeah, hopefully, I mean, hopefully. But the
[00:12:26.720 --> 00:12:32.560]   major point though is that it's not just about performance. It's about form. That it's not enough
[00:12:32.560 --> 00:12:36.880]   to say that, well, this you can, you will give you an iMac or a Mac mini that has all the performance
[00:12:36.880 --> 00:12:43.280]   of what would be the next incremental cheese grater original Mac Pro. Again, it's basically the
[00:12:43.280 --> 00:12:48.000]   people who are, once you're spending above a certain amount of money, I'll speak for myself.
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:52.000]   And I think that I also, I think that this is conforming with a lot of other people.
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:56.240]   Above a certain amount of money, when you tell me that you're not going to give me what I want,
[00:12:56.240 --> 00:12:59.680]   and I know that I have good reasons for wanting what I want, that, no, I'll give you something
[00:12:59.680 --> 00:13:03.920]   that you'll like just as well. I'm like, but I'm trying to give you, I'm not going to spend $3,000
[00:13:03.920 --> 00:13:08.800]   on something that I have to get used to. So just, I'm just saying it's not about just performance.
[00:13:08.800 --> 00:13:13.440]   It's all about here is a form factor that works for not only what I want to do today,
[00:13:13.440 --> 00:13:16.480]   but the way I'm going to be using a Mac on my desktop for the next two years.
[00:13:16.480 --> 00:13:21.680]   Is there any chance they do that Mac Pro at a lower end or is that really only going to be a
[00:13:21.680 --> 00:13:25.920]   high end? It's super expensive for Apple to make, and even if a lot of developers bought them,
[00:13:25.920 --> 00:13:31.280]   they wouldn't sell that many. So like the math is like, do we do it? If we don't do it,
[00:13:31.280 --> 00:13:34.960]   it's we save a ton of money. But if we decide we want to be in this business, this is what we
[00:13:34.960 --> 00:13:39.280]   have to sell it for, and who can we sell it to for that cost, including all the stuff we're putting
[00:13:39.280 --> 00:13:43.840]   into it. And it's also just quite possible that Apple will never be able to serve every market and
[00:13:43.840 --> 00:13:47.280]   that they're, everyone's going to have to, Apple's going to have to choose what they think that
[00:13:47.280 --> 00:13:50.640]   they can sell and developers are going to have to choose what they think they can support. And
[00:13:50.640 --> 00:13:55.360]   some of them might really want specific things, but they might not be a big enough market to
[00:13:55.360 --> 00:14:00.960]   support them. So maybe Apple's answer is Mac mini with an eGPU and a sat external NAS and all these
[00:14:00.960 --> 00:14:05.120]   things. And they can say, no, we don't want that and make enough noise. Maybe it'll make sense.
[00:14:05.120 --> 00:14:09.680]   But I think we are finally getting more and more pieces to cover more and more uses,
[00:14:09.680 --> 00:14:14.560]   but we'll never get them all at once. Well, they do a lower end display because they remember
[00:14:14.560 --> 00:14:19.520]   very famously a couple of years ago, stopped making cinema displays. Now they have this Pro
[00:14:19.520 --> 00:14:25.600]   display XDR, but it's $6,000 with stand. Will they make a less expensive version of this?
[00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:30.320]   Their current response to that. So there's what they say and what they'll do. So what they say is
[00:14:30.320 --> 00:14:35.040]   that there's never been a better variety of USB-C monitors and they all work great with new Macs.
[00:14:35.040 --> 00:14:40.080]   The truth is that they don't do stuff just to do stuff. I love them to make a router. It's one of
[00:14:40.080 --> 00:14:44.000]   the most important bits of kit that they don't make in my opinion right now. But it's again,
[00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:49.360]   it's that math is like, is it worth taking the time and the resources with our limited amount
[00:14:49.360 --> 00:14:53.760]   of focus to produce something that's essentially a commodities, why they don't make a TV set.
[00:14:53.760 --> 00:14:58.880]   My hope is, my dream is that they make these 6K monitors and they're pushing out a bunch of
[00:14:58.880 --> 00:15:02.880]   technology that people have just never seen before. The way they're using double backlights,
[00:15:02.880 --> 00:15:08.000]   mini LED, the way they're using blue LEDs and reconverting them, reconstaging them into white,
[00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:11.600]   and just taking all those technologies, spending a year or two, commoditizing them,
[00:15:11.600 --> 00:15:16.480]   and then being able to take some of those things and making a display that is lower cost, but still,
[00:15:16.480 --> 00:15:20.880]   it's still better than just slapping an LG panel into an Apple chassis and saying,
[00:15:20.880 --> 00:15:24.160]   here you go, that's all we're doing for you. Who makes these panels?
[00:15:24.160 --> 00:15:29.920]   I don't know. I've not found a commercial equivalent for them yet. It's quite possible
[00:15:29.920 --> 00:15:33.600]   it's Apple display outsourcing the fabbing to another company.
[00:15:33.600 --> 00:15:36.640]   Because that was another complaint some people had as well. They're just buying LG panels,
[00:15:36.640 --> 00:15:44.320]   but it's not clear. The biggest issue I have with it is you can only use it with a Mac Pro,
[00:15:44.320 --> 00:15:47.200]   right? It doesn't have HDMI. It doesn't have any standard.
[00:15:47.200 --> 00:15:51.840]   No, you can't. Well, you can use it with Macs. You can use it with the more powerful Macs
[00:15:51.840 --> 00:15:58.000]   in 6K mode. You can use it with some of the smaller Macs in 5K mode. I think if you have some
[00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:04.080]   of the higher end iMac Pros and iMacs, you can use the two of them. Blackmagic has announced a
[00:16:04.080 --> 00:16:08.880]   breakout box. I forget it's an SDIS, whatever the industry standard is, you'll have a bunch of
[00:16:08.880 --> 00:16:14.160]   different ports on the outside of it. What's your response to people who said Apple should make
[00:16:14.160 --> 00:16:16.880]   a $1,000 stand, but they should have never have told anybody.
[00:16:16.880 --> 00:16:21.760]   I think Apple would tell you that. I think if you ask anybody at that thing that say,
[00:16:21.760 --> 00:16:25.920]   "I don't know how it got passed, Phil Schiller. I don't know how it got passed on." They watch
[00:16:25.920 --> 00:16:31.920]   this for days. Nobody understands how this got on there. Please, if we could just go back.
[00:16:31.920 --> 00:16:33.360]   Leroy Jenkins!
[00:16:33.360 --> 00:16:39.680]   Honestly, it didn't bother me as much as I think it bothered everybody in the
[00:16:39.680 --> 00:16:44.880]   hall. Obviously, a lot of pundits. But it killed the whole segment. People were loving that
[00:16:44.880 --> 00:16:51.200]   segmently. Yes. But I also understood that Pros A) they're not that price sensitive and B)
[00:16:51.200 --> 00:16:57.200]   they often don't want a stand. Alex Lindsey used to take the stands off all the monitors
[00:16:57.200 --> 00:17:03.040]   because he'd use arms with a visa mount. But it's like they didn't announce the wheel price.
[00:17:03.040 --> 00:17:06.240]   Just don't say it's a wrong audience because you know they would have gotten the
[00:17:06.240 --> 00:17:09.360]   wheel because the wheels are going to be 500 bucks minimum. Did you see the talk show yet, Leo?
[00:17:09.360 --> 00:17:12.640]   Because it starts off with Gruber looking at Jaws and going, "So how much are the wheels?"
[00:17:12.640 --> 00:17:15.360]   And Jaws just looks back and goes, "How many do you want?"
[00:17:15.360 --> 00:17:23.040]   Good answer. Did he ever find out? No. They haven't announced. I don't think they're going anywhere
[00:17:23.040 --> 00:17:28.640]   near that. They'll never say, "By the time you bought a $5,000 monitor, any extras is, you know,
[00:17:28.640 --> 00:17:33.280]   especially because most people will be buying this with a Mac Pro. Really only."
[00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:37.200]   You could say you can run it on an iMac Pro. But you know, what's the point?
[00:17:37.200 --> 00:17:44.560]   Their positioning is that most times people in these workflows buy one reference monitor
[00:17:44.560 --> 00:17:48.560]   of one of the Sony and the last few years. Yeah. And now in this case, they can buy
[00:17:48.560 --> 00:17:52.720]   seven. And not just so that people who are working on the footage can be color accurate,
[00:17:52.720 --> 00:17:56.640]   but so they don't look at their inaccurate displays and go bother the color guy and say,
[00:17:56.640 --> 00:18:00.080]   "This is wrong when he knows it's not." The whole chain can be accurate. So they're actually,
[00:18:00.080 --> 00:18:04.720]   I bet you they are. These monitors might even outsell the Mac Pro actually now that you mention it.
[00:18:04.720 --> 00:18:12.320]   It's a different thing from the argument about the Mac Pro itself. If you want a cheaper monitor,
[00:18:12.320 --> 00:18:15.520]   there are lots of alternatives out there. But the people I've been talking about in the Pro
[00:18:15.520 --> 00:18:20.160]   industry have been telling me that there's really nothing quite like this on the market yet,
[00:18:20.160 --> 00:18:28.880]   where you can't get this kind of quality, this kind of assurance that you're mixing these colors
[00:18:28.880 --> 00:18:33.680]   right for this kind of a price point. And so I don't think that that's a controversial thing at all.
[00:18:33.680 --> 00:18:39.760]   But I'm also curious to see how much these wheels are going to cost compared to like going down
[00:18:39.760 --> 00:18:46.080]   over free. And the fact that they have wheels for the Mac Pro workflow team, because they're like,
[00:18:46.080 --> 00:18:51.280]   "No, you don't understand. You're going to roll it around." We got to move them around. We need wheels.
[00:18:51.280 --> 00:18:57.280]   Actually, can I tell on Laurie for a second? Because it was delightful to me. We're standing in
[00:18:57.280 --> 00:19:02.240]   the hands-on area. Phil Schiller comes up to us and Laurie goes, "Where can I touch that laser edge
[00:19:02.240 --> 00:19:05.840]   that laser texturing? I heard there's a place around here where I could touch it." And she's like,
[00:19:05.840 --> 00:19:09.200]   "I'm pretty sure not." And Laurie's like, "No, no, I really want to touch it." I needed to touch it.
[00:19:09.200 --> 00:19:12.720]   I don't think we let you do that. It was awesome. This is on the monitor.
[00:19:12.720 --> 00:19:17.440]   I got my first chance to meet one of these Apple executives. And the first thing I said is,
[00:19:17.440 --> 00:19:22.640]   "What can I touch?" And that's why we love you, Laurie Gil, because you don't care. You don't care.
[00:19:23.840 --> 00:19:28.240]   He's got some right. That's a good question. It's not like the donuts in the conference room.
[00:19:28.240 --> 00:19:33.360]   It's not like if you touch it, now that's yours. That was her plan.
[00:19:33.360 --> 00:19:38.640]   Yes. It's mine now. I'm going to let it. I'm going to throw it to the place.
[00:19:38.640 --> 00:19:44.640]   As soon as they mentioned that the matte screen was laser etched, though, I immediately thought,
[00:19:44.640 --> 00:19:48.160]   "Well, what is that like? What is that going to be? Is that something that you'll be able to
[00:19:48.160 --> 00:19:53.520]   could you scratch the screen and feel the laser edge? Or will there be a glass covering over that?
[00:19:53.520 --> 00:19:58.080]   And if there is a glass covering over that, how does that affect the matte refraction?"
[00:19:58.080 --> 00:20:00.480]   So I feel like that was a little bit...
[00:20:00.480 --> 00:20:01.040]   Spare?
[00:20:01.040 --> 00:20:02.640]   Like, I want to know what that feels like.
[00:20:02.640 --> 00:20:03.520]   When I...
[00:20:03.520 --> 00:20:05.680]   You just have to try it on the one you buy.
[00:20:05.680 --> 00:20:06.160]   Yeah.
[00:20:06.160 --> 00:20:07.120]   That's me.
[00:20:07.120 --> 00:20:07.680]   Yeah.
[00:20:07.680 --> 00:20:11.360]   So did you see this two side by side? Because there's a glossy and there's a matte, right?
[00:20:11.360 --> 00:20:17.040]   They didn't put any side by side, though. But the thing is that the matte screen,
[00:20:17.040 --> 00:20:24.160]   I have a matte ultra wide and it looks matte. It looks like blurry, fuzzy kind of.
[00:20:24.160 --> 00:20:24.720]   Yeah.
[00:20:24.720 --> 00:20:31.520]   And the matte pro display does not. I can tell the difference between this.
[00:20:31.520 --> 00:20:32.240]   Oh, interesting.
[00:20:32.240 --> 00:20:39.760]   The non matte is definitely sparkleier, clearer, brighter.
[00:20:39.760 --> 00:20:46.320]   The matte one on its own is the best looking matte screen I've ever seen.
[00:20:46.320 --> 00:20:50.560]   And I do use a matte screen, so I'm very familiar with the differences between the two.
[00:20:50.560 --> 00:20:53.040]   I'm not just kind of like, "I don't know what they look like."
[00:20:53.040 --> 00:21:00.080]   So if you're a matte screen user, you're going to just love how clear that matte screen is.
[00:21:00.080 --> 00:21:04.720]   But when I would look at one in one room and then look at the other one in another,
[00:21:04.720 --> 00:21:08.320]   I could look at it and just go, "Oh, that's a matte screen," and that's not.
[00:21:08.320 --> 00:21:08.560]   So...
[00:21:08.560 --> 00:21:12.880]   Well, Lori was busy with the ADA's. I got to go to a bake-off with the screens.
[00:21:12.880 --> 00:21:18.320]   And so what they put a Dell HDR display next to the ISO display,
[00:21:18.320 --> 00:21:22.080]   next to a matte Apple display, next to the regular Apple display,
[00:21:22.080 --> 00:21:27.440]   next to the $30,000 Sony display, next to the $45,000 Sony display.
[00:21:27.440 --> 00:21:30.560]   And then they ran them through a whole gamut of testing.
[00:21:30.560 --> 00:21:34.160]   And the Dell one had good brightness, but it did it at the expense of color.
[00:21:34.160 --> 00:21:37.520]   Like you could tell compared to all the other ones, the colors were just way off.
[00:21:37.520 --> 00:21:40.240]   The ISO display, I think, never got past 400 nits.
[00:21:40.240 --> 00:21:42.880]   So it was like really dark all the time.
[00:21:42.880 --> 00:21:44.720]   The Apple displays looked really, really good.
[00:21:44.720 --> 00:21:47.520]   The Sony displays had better peak brightness,
[00:21:47.520 --> 00:21:50.640]   but if there was any significant amount of light colors at all,
[00:21:50.640 --> 00:21:58.720]   like the sun in the corner, a sky, you would get like 50 seconds to five minutes of peak brightness.
[00:21:58.720 --> 00:22:00.880]   And then the light would change from green to orange
[00:22:00.880 --> 00:22:02.720]   meant that they were no longer in reference mode.
[00:22:02.720 --> 00:22:04.560]   So I'm guessing that's when people go get coffee
[00:22:04.560 --> 00:22:06.880]   and you have to wait a few minutes for it to cool down again.
[00:22:06.880 --> 00:22:13.040]   But the Apple displays can go to 1000 nits forever and stick and peak at 1600 nits,
[00:22:13.040 --> 00:22:17.440]   which isn't quite as bright as the OLEDs, but they can just persist, which is really important.
[00:22:17.440 --> 00:22:22.080]   My sense of this was Apple flexing its muscles, kind of like
[00:22:22.080 --> 00:22:26.560]   Ford building a half million dollar for GT.
[00:22:26.560 --> 00:22:30.160]   Most people won't, you can't sell it to more than a few thousand people,
[00:22:30.160 --> 00:22:37.120]   but it shows that we, first of all, finally have the real answer to can't innovate my
[00:22:37.120 --> 00:22:39.680]   whoo hoo hoo. My apps.
[00:22:39.680 --> 00:22:43.200]   Because clearly this is innovative.
[00:22:43.200 --> 00:22:46.880]   In fact, it has a lot of technologies, not just from Apple, but promise
[00:22:46.880 --> 00:22:52.640]   and radion that it lets them ship really cutting edge technology.
[00:22:52.640 --> 00:22:56.240]   So it's a very neat, it's not just another PC in other words.
[00:22:57.280 --> 00:23:01.680]   Just what they've done with those GPUs is amazing.
[00:23:01.680 --> 00:23:03.680]   Hell, it is amazing.
[00:23:03.680 --> 00:23:05.920]   And again, that was radion doing it, right?
[00:23:05.920 --> 00:23:09.760]   It was AMD doing it, not Apple that were created for the
[00:23:09.760 --> 00:23:11.440]   pro buy.
[00:23:11.440 --> 00:23:13.440]   Right, but yeah, exactly.
[00:23:13.440 --> 00:23:17.600]   But the way that they've got these cards working together in a way that it's,
[00:23:17.600 --> 00:23:18.880]   yeah, I mean, it's a.
[00:23:18.880 --> 00:23:23.600]   Is that the fabric connector that is infinity fabric, but it's also the Apple
[00:23:23.600 --> 00:23:27.120]   Mac extensibility kind of module.
[00:23:27.120 --> 00:23:27.840]   Okay.
[00:23:27.840 --> 00:23:28.960]   And these are new, right?
[00:23:28.960 --> 00:23:31.760]   There's no other Apple device that has this stuff.
[00:23:31.760 --> 00:23:35.200]   I've never seen infinity fabric used for GPUs before.
[00:23:35.200 --> 00:23:38.160]   I was talking about it with a friend of mine, actually with George's husband before,
[00:23:38.160 --> 00:23:41.840]   that has been used for their CPUs to put the chiplets together to get better performance.
[00:23:41.840 --> 00:23:45.360]   This is my first, the first time at least I've ever seen it applied to a GPU.
[00:23:45.360 --> 00:23:46.400]   And it's so the, the.
[00:23:46.400 --> 00:23:48.320]   By the way, it's not Apple's technology.
[00:23:48.320 --> 00:23:49.680]   That's an AMD technology.
[00:23:49.680 --> 00:23:53.440]   No, it's an AMD technology, but the reality was they were not going to be
[00:23:53.440 --> 00:23:58.400]   able to get Nvidia GPUs again, because Nvidia still won't let them have direct access
[00:23:58.400 --> 00:23:59.680]   to the silicon.
[00:23:59.680 --> 00:24:00.720]   They still want to go through.
[00:24:00.720 --> 00:24:02.240]   Yeah, they want them to go through CUDA.
[00:24:02.240 --> 00:24:06.480]   And that's very hard for Apple because like for VR, Apple gets everything out of the way,
[00:24:06.480 --> 00:24:11.040]   so you can write directly for all the technologies like metal and like the new Swift UI they want.
[00:24:11.040 --> 00:24:12.800]   They don't want you to have to care what card is there.
[00:24:12.800 --> 00:24:14.400]   They want it all abstracted away.
[00:24:14.400 --> 00:24:15.360]   So it just doesn't work.
[00:24:15.360 --> 00:24:17.680]   And so Apple said, well, we need performance.
[00:24:17.680 --> 00:24:21.120]   So this configuration of AMD gives us industry leading performance.
[00:24:21.120 --> 00:24:22.320]   And we need compatibility.
[00:24:22.320 --> 00:24:25.920]   So we'll just get Hydra and all these other people will show them this and say, you got a port.
[00:24:25.920 --> 00:24:27.120]   They're like, yeah, you're right.
[00:24:27.120 --> 00:24:27.920]   We got a port.
[00:24:27.920 --> 00:24:32.160]   And then all that's left is like religion because some people just love CUDA and they'll never,
[00:24:32.160 --> 00:24:32.880]   they'll never fight.
[00:24:32.880 --> 00:24:34.400]   They'll never be able to conquer that.
[00:24:34.400 --> 00:24:38.960]   But in terms of performance and in terms of compatibility, I think they've answered both those things.
[00:24:38.960 --> 00:24:44.080]   So Infinity Fabric is used by AMD and has been for a couple of years for their Ryzen chips.
[00:24:44.080 --> 00:24:44.400]   Yeah.
[00:24:44.400 --> 00:24:49.280]   Makes me wonder why this Mac Pro doesn't have Ryzen in it instead of an Intel CPU.
[00:24:50.160 --> 00:24:52.800]   The, I mean, it's first Intel owns Thunderbolt.
[00:24:52.800 --> 00:24:55.120]   So they would have to license it, which they may or may not be.
[00:24:55.120 --> 00:24:57.520]   They have done it for some motherboard makers.
[00:24:57.520 --> 00:25:03.040]   And Apple also might have an overall deal with Intel that makes it hard to do individual CPUs
[00:25:03.040 --> 00:25:03.680]   that aren't Intel.
[00:25:03.680 --> 00:25:07.120]   So they chose a, says the Ryzen don't support Thunderbolt.
[00:25:07.120 --> 00:25:11.920]   They, it's an Intel technology and Intel has licensed it to some motherboard makers.
[00:25:11.920 --> 00:25:16.480]   But there's no, there's nothing that would compel them to license it.
[00:25:16.480 --> 00:25:19.920]   Clearly the pros, that's an important issue. In fact, we know it is.
[00:25:19.920 --> 00:25:21.040]   Apple is all in on Thunderbolt.
[00:25:21.040 --> 00:25:21.040]   On Thunderbolt.
[00:25:21.040 --> 00:25:22.640]   Thunderbolt ports in this thing.
[00:25:22.640 --> 00:25:25.680]   On the top of the case.
[00:25:25.680 --> 00:25:27.040]   On the top, right.
[00:25:27.040 --> 00:25:28.560]   There's two of them in the top of the case.
[00:25:28.560 --> 00:25:33.040]   So what did they, do they have to be stopped from putting all the ports on the bottom on the
[00:25:33.040 --> 00:25:34.320]   underside of the Apple mouse?
[00:25:34.320 --> 00:25:39.360]   There's internal U.S.E.A. so that you can hide your dongles because some of the software like
[00:25:39.360 --> 00:25:42.400]   Maya still has hardware dongles to, to, to uncompy.
[00:25:42.400 --> 00:25:43.520]   So you can put them inside.
[00:25:43.520 --> 00:25:44.960]   You can put them inside.
[00:25:44.960 --> 00:25:44.960]   You can put them inside.
[00:25:44.960 --> 00:25:46.160]   So awesome.
[00:25:46.160 --> 00:25:47.200]   That's so brilliant.
[00:25:47.200 --> 00:25:48.240]   That's so awesome.
[00:25:48.240 --> 00:25:51.120]   That's also safe because again, you're rattling around a studio.
[00:25:51.120 --> 00:25:52.960]   You don't want to knock it off or damage it or.
[00:25:52.960 --> 00:25:54.240]   Yeah, or have somebody take it.
[00:25:54.240 --> 00:25:55.040]   Yeah.
[00:25:55.040 --> 00:25:58.320]   It by, but even by accident.
[00:25:58.320 --> 00:26:02.960]   I, I just, I'm, I'm glad it looks like a cheese grater.
[00:26:02.960 --> 00:26:05.280]   That's kind of funny.
[00:26:05.280 --> 00:26:05.920]   Even more.
[00:26:05.920 --> 00:26:07.120]   They like lent into it.
[00:26:07.120 --> 00:26:09.120]   Yeah, they, they leaned into the cheese grater.
[00:26:09.120 --> 00:26:11.120]   So does the back of the display.
[00:26:11.120 --> 00:26:14.000]   I think it's beautiful.
[00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:15.200]   It's like so much air.
[00:26:15.200 --> 00:26:19.360]   Initially I looked at it and I thought, it looks too much like a cheese grater.
[00:26:19.360 --> 00:26:19.680]   It's kind of.
[00:26:19.680 --> 00:26:20.800]   Those are the matte ones by the way.
[00:26:20.800 --> 00:26:22.480]   Those are the matte screens.
[00:26:22.480 --> 00:26:22.720]   Yeah.
[00:26:22.720 --> 00:26:23.200]   Yeah.
[00:26:23.200 --> 00:26:24.720]   The nano textured matte.
[00:26:24.720 --> 00:26:26.160]   Yes.
[00:26:26.160 --> 00:26:27.040]   Would you get the matte?
[00:26:27.040 --> 00:26:27.840]   Who has kids?
[00:26:27.840 --> 00:26:28.240]   Which would you.
[00:26:28.240 --> 00:26:31.760]   I would get, I don't think I'd spend a thousand on it though.
[00:26:31.760 --> 00:26:33.840]   If they were the same price, I'd get the matte in a heartbeat.
[00:26:33.840 --> 00:26:35.520]   But I don't know if I'd spend a thousand bucks on it.
[00:26:35.520 --> 00:26:38.880]   Because the standard one looked fine to me and I used to enter displays.
[00:26:38.880 --> 00:26:39.120]   Yeah.
[00:26:39.120 --> 00:26:42.240]   But the color was just as bright as on a glossy.
[00:26:43.200 --> 00:26:45.600]   Yeah. And it doesn't have the rainbow effect either, which is really nice.
[00:26:45.600 --> 00:26:46.160]   Oh, that's nice.
[00:26:46.160 --> 00:26:46.800]   No more A.
[00:26:46.800 --> 00:26:48.160]   Yeah.
[00:26:48.160 --> 00:26:49.520]   Well, you can't have more A.
[00:26:49.520 --> 00:26:57.040]   I feel like Apple, there is a huge opportunity for Apple with developers at this point.
[00:26:57.040 --> 00:27:00.720]   A lot of developers, you know, Microsoft clearly understands this.
[00:27:00.720 --> 00:27:02.720]   This is why they put a Linux kernel in Windows.
[00:27:02.720 --> 00:27:08.640]   But I still think that Microsoft solution in Windows is pretty weak compared to Mac OS.
[00:27:09.760 --> 00:27:13.920]   In fact, most developers I know would just buy a Windows machine and put Linux on it.
[00:27:13.920 --> 00:27:18.240]   I think Apple has developers still love Mac OS.
[00:27:18.240 --> 00:27:19.520]   There's a real opportunity here.
[00:27:19.520 --> 00:27:23.440]   Maybe the Mac mini solves that or scratches that itch.
[00:27:23.440 --> 00:27:26.880]   But I feel like there's a real opportunity to say to developers,
[00:27:26.880 --> 00:27:33.120]   "Yeah, we do make the best machine for any kind of development, even full stack web development."
[00:27:33.120 --> 00:27:36.080]   And it doesn't have to be for Mac OS.
[00:27:36.080 --> 00:27:38.880]   But of course, if you get developers with Macs, what are they going to develop?
[00:27:38.880 --> 00:27:45.680]   Especially with things like the new, that amazing SwiftUI kit.
[00:27:45.680 --> 00:27:46.400]   Yeah.
[00:27:46.400 --> 00:27:48.400]   I feel like this is Apple.
[00:27:48.400 --> 00:27:52.000]   Do you just think like half the slots, like half the size, half the slots with the
[00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:53.680]   Mac and Mac and the state display?
[00:27:53.680 --> 00:27:54.800]   A MiniMac Pro.
[00:27:54.800 --> 00:27:55.840]   Yeah.
[00:27:55.840 --> 00:27:57.840]   I would love that.
[00:27:57.840 --> 00:27:59.600]   I would love that, you know.
[00:27:59.600 --> 00:28:00.800]   And the problem is,
[00:28:00.800 --> 00:28:04.640]   you Mini doesn't have all of these interesting technologies like
[00:28:04.640 --> 00:28:08.320]   Infinity Fabric and this new technology for the promise to go into the room.
[00:28:08.320 --> 00:28:10.240]   Maybe you could have just one of those units.
[00:28:10.240 --> 00:28:13.120]   Like it doesn't have two, you can't fit two ones.
[00:28:13.120 --> 00:28:13.680]   Plenty.
[00:28:13.680 --> 00:28:15.520]   I don't need four video cards.
[00:28:15.520 --> 00:28:16.000]   If you want to get one in there.
[00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:16.400]   Yeah.
[00:28:16.400 --> 00:28:18.240]   Developers don't make any.
[00:28:18.240 --> 00:28:19.920]   We're one of these modules.
[00:28:19.920 --> 00:28:22.160]   And then ASIC is pre-programmable, which is awesome.
[00:28:22.160 --> 00:28:22.160]   Yeah.
[00:28:22.160 --> 00:28:25.760]   So like you can get that, you can get that afterburner card and they
[00:28:25.760 --> 00:28:27.360]   figure out all sorts of fancy things to do.
[00:28:27.360 --> 00:28:30.160]   Maybe after Apple ramps up, did they say where they're going to make these?
[00:28:30.160 --> 00:28:31.520]   Are they going to make them in China?
[00:28:31.520 --> 00:28:32.720]   They did not say yet.
[00:28:33.600 --> 00:28:36.240]   See, I really want to remember that the trash came back famously.
[00:28:36.240 --> 00:28:37.040]   It was made in Texas.
[00:28:37.040 --> 00:28:40.080]   And that was somewhat problematic.
[00:28:40.080 --> 00:28:44.720]   I would, these, these, given the tariff situation, the uncertain future with China,
[00:28:44.720 --> 00:28:46.880]   boy, these need to be made somewhere else, if you ask me.
[00:28:46.880 --> 00:28:48.800]   And not next to so easy.
[00:28:48.800 --> 00:28:50.880]   I believe Apple display isn't Apple display in Taiwan.
[00:28:50.880 --> 00:28:52.480]   I think I feel like being Apple display isn't Taiwan.
[00:28:52.480 --> 00:28:53.760]   I think Apple right answer.
[00:28:53.760 --> 00:28:59.200]   And then did promise not create a new hard drive module for them as well?
[00:28:59.200 --> 00:29:02.480]   I didn't see all the, you know, I saw the Black Magic one,
[00:29:02.480 --> 00:29:04.640]   but there was just a bunch of them coming out all at once.
[00:29:04.640 --> 00:29:05.200]   Yeah.
[00:29:05.200 --> 00:29:07.520]   I think promise did make, did announce that.
[00:29:07.520 --> 00:29:08.080]   Yeah.
[00:29:08.080 --> 00:29:13.520]   So it's, they're, they're the internal hard drive sleds, which is the best name ever.
[00:29:13.520 --> 00:29:15.440]   That, uh,
[00:29:15.440 --> 00:29:20.000]   I mean, the thing about this too is like all the YouTubers there filming have like $45,000,
[00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:23.920]   or red cameras, and usually they have more than one of them.
[00:29:23.920 --> 00:29:24.560]   You're kidding.
[00:29:24.560 --> 00:29:25.440]   Very different market.
[00:29:25.440 --> 00:29:26.000]   Are you kidding me?
[00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:26.880]   In Arizona.
[00:29:26.880 --> 00:29:27.680]   No, I'm not.
[00:29:27.680 --> 00:29:30.320]   There were YouTubers there with Alexa cameras.
[00:29:30.960 --> 00:29:36.080]   Yeah, Jonathan Morrison uses an Alexa MKVHD uses a red, not a red weapon,
[00:29:36.080 --> 00:29:38.400]   uses the new one, the red something or other.
[00:29:38.400 --> 00:29:39.600]   I forget the name of it.
[00:29:39.600 --> 00:29:42.880]   And when you watch the studio videos, there's like more than one mounted at a time.
[00:29:42.880 --> 00:29:44.160]   It totally wasted on YouTube.
[00:29:44.160 --> 00:29:45.680]   I might add, but okay, fine.
[00:29:45.680 --> 00:29:48.880]   They're, they're, they're for the future of 8K YouTube.
[00:29:48.880 --> 00:29:49.280]   Yeah.
[00:29:49.280 --> 00:29:51.040]   8K YouTube here it comes.
[00:29:51.040 --> 00:29:54.240]   So the, this, this promise technology is for a rate.
[00:29:54.240 --> 00:29:56.240]   It's the Pegasus R4i.
[00:29:56.240 --> 00:29:59.360]   It fits in the MPX expansion slot.
[00:29:59.920 --> 00:30:04.560]   And so, you know, we all kind of laughed or choked when we heard a $6,000
[00:30:04.560 --> 00:30:07.680]   Mac Pro with a 256 gig SSD.
[00:30:07.680 --> 00:30:13.200]   But that's just, that's almost just for your, uh, that's for your scratch files.
[00:30:13.200 --> 00:30:14.720]   This is what you're going to put in there.
[00:30:14.720 --> 00:30:16.080]   Oh, so I asked about that.
[00:30:16.080 --> 00:30:19.680]   And the, the unofficial answer is that there are people who want nothing to do with any
[00:30:19.680 --> 00:30:22.000]   components that Apple would ever put into this box.
[00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:24.960]   So basically give them the least thing possible because a minute they get it,
[00:30:24.960 --> 00:30:27.920]   they're attaching it to their network of crazy storage.
[00:30:27.920 --> 00:30:30.480]   And they're putting in their own car, their own video cards.
[00:30:30.480 --> 00:30:34.480]   You know, basically they just, they just want, this is a minimal buy-in for the Apple box.
[00:30:34.480 --> 00:30:34.800]   Right.
[00:30:34.800 --> 00:30:37.120]   As long as it runs Mac OS, they're fine.
[00:30:37.120 --> 00:30:38.400]   They'll handle everything else themselves.
[00:30:38.400 --> 00:30:44.560]   Well, this promise, these promise driveslets contain four, uh, 7,200 RPM hard drives.
[00:30:44.560 --> 00:30:51.280]   So you could have eight of them times what is the standard now, three, four terabytes.
[00:30:51.280 --> 00:30:56.080]   So we're talking a huge amount of, if you want an internal storage, it's, it's available to you.
[00:30:56.080 --> 00:30:56.880]   I guess is the point.
[00:30:57.600 --> 00:30:59.440]   And there's a rack mountable version Leo.
[00:30:59.440 --> 00:31:02.640]   I, I, you know what, that made my little heart go pit of it.
[00:31:02.640 --> 00:31:03.280]   I know, right.
[00:31:03.280 --> 00:31:07.040]   It's like the X-serve, all the X-serve love came on Mac OS.
[00:31:07.040 --> 00:31:09.520]   And I just, I'm sad that Alex Lindsay wasn't here.
[00:31:09.520 --> 00:31:13.440]   He was otherwise engaged, but I, I, I did text him and he said, I said,
[00:31:13.440 --> 00:31:14.480]   are you, how many of these you're going to buy?
[00:31:14.480 --> 00:31:17.520]   Is as many as I can get about, I'm going to have to put a second mortgage in the house.
[00:31:17.520 --> 00:31:23.120]   Because it will be expensive, but this is exactly what Alex wanted all along.
[00:31:23.120 --> 00:31:26.640]   I messaged him and asked if he was getting the six pack with a dozen.
[00:31:26.640 --> 00:31:28.080]   [LAUGH]
[00:31:28.080 --> 00:31:28.720]   You didn't answer.
[00:31:28.720 --> 00:31:30.000]   [LAUGH]
[00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:32.800]   Yeah, I think that this is the one Mac that unites everybody.
[00:31:32.800 --> 00:31:35.520]   So I think everybody is buying as many as they can afford.
[00:31:35.520 --> 00:31:39.520]   It's just that for 99% of people, the Mac users zero is how many we can.
[00:31:39.520 --> 00:31:40.000]   Yeah.
[00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:44.320]   Yeah. I mean, nobody at this table, uh, very few, there are, did any of the, you know,
[00:31:44.320 --> 00:31:45.600]   is Gruber going to buy one?
[00:31:45.600 --> 00:31:46.560]   I don't think so.
[00:31:46.560 --> 00:31:49.920]   Is, uh, Marco's going to buy one for the summer house, one for the main house.
[00:31:49.920 --> 00:31:50.800]   Marco will buy one.
[00:31:50.800 --> 00:31:54.880]   He's probably going to, like, I think Syracuse is going to wait for Marco to buy it and then,
[00:31:54.880 --> 00:31:56.080]   you know, see how it goes.
[00:31:56.880 --> 00:31:57.360]   Wow.
[00:31:57.360 --> 00:32:01.440]   But all those video people there, again, like there, there were a bunch of people there,
[00:32:01.440 --> 00:32:02.960]   and Apple is smart on who they invite.
[00:32:02.960 --> 00:32:06.880]   There were a bunch of people there who work in this industry and they didn't flinch at the price.
[00:32:06.880 --> 00:32:08.240]   All they cared about was availability.
[00:32:08.240 --> 00:32:10.400]   Like, they didn't even, it's a rounding error for them.
[00:32:10.400 --> 00:32:12.000]   And Alex has always said that.
[00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:17.040]   He said professionals, you know, in fact, a lot of people just charge it back to the client,
[00:32:17.040 --> 00:32:20.080]   which means the higher the price, the more the markup, the more they'll make.
[00:32:20.080 --> 00:32:21.520]   So they don't care.
[00:32:21.520 --> 00:32:22.720]   A thousand dollars stand great.
[00:32:22.720 --> 00:32:24.800]   That means more money in my pocket.
[00:32:24.800 --> 00:32:26.080]   And I get a nice stand.
[00:32:26.080 --> 00:32:31.200]   There was some confusion because some people were saying Apple had the stand on display,
[00:32:31.200 --> 00:32:32.640]   but that was an AR experience.
[00:32:32.640 --> 00:32:34.720]   You could walk up to the stand or to the queue,
[00:32:34.720 --> 00:32:38.880]   hold up an iPad and it would explode out and you could sort of explore all the different parts of it.
[00:32:38.880 --> 00:32:40.400]   That was very impressive, by the way.
[00:32:40.400 --> 00:32:43.920]   That Safari, you go to the page for the Mac Pro at the bottom and says,
[00:32:43.920 --> 00:32:47.920]   okay, open this in Safari and press this button and you'll see one on your desk.
[00:32:47.920 --> 00:32:49.040]   And it really worked well.
[00:32:49.040 --> 00:32:50.480]   I thought that was very impressive.
[00:32:50.480 --> 00:32:53.520]   Actually, you have a picture of you with it exploded.
[00:32:53.520 --> 00:32:55.040]   It's all the parts exploded out.
[00:32:55.040 --> 00:32:55.360]   Yeah.
[00:32:55.360 --> 00:32:56.480]   Very cool.
[00:32:56.480 --> 00:33:01.200]   And there's some really, especially in that display, like the double backlight,
[00:33:01.200 --> 00:33:03.360]   there's some really interesting display technology going on there.
[00:33:03.360 --> 00:33:07.200]   What, I mean, we can continue to celebrate them.
[00:33:07.200 --> 00:33:09.040]   There is, there's your exploded image.
[00:33:09.040 --> 00:33:14.080]   We continue to celebrate this Mac Pro and I think it's well worth doing.
[00:33:14.080 --> 00:33:17.760]   It is, I mean, this is something that I can't think of.
[00:33:17.760 --> 00:33:18.960]   Dell wouldn't do this.
[00:33:18.960 --> 00:33:20.080]   HP wouldn't do this.
[00:33:20.560 --> 00:33:23.280]   No Pete, there's nobody else who could do this or would do this.
[00:33:23.280 --> 00:33:24.080]   It's the Harakan.
[00:33:24.080 --> 00:33:28.080]   I mean, Audi doesn't sell Lamborghini Harakans, but you got to make Lamborghini Harakan
[00:33:28.080 --> 00:33:29.360]   because it's on top of everything.
[00:33:29.360 --> 00:33:29.840]   Exactly.
[00:33:29.840 --> 00:33:30.800]   Exactly.
[00:33:30.800 --> 00:33:31.840]   This is their race car.
[00:33:31.840 --> 00:33:33.840]   This is for the Formula One fan.
[00:33:33.840 --> 00:33:40.960]   I think this also kind of answers that question or the response to the comment that you have heard of.
[00:33:40.960 --> 00:33:49.600]   Apple isn't trying to work with the pros anymore.
[00:33:49.600 --> 00:33:56.240]   Like I think, when the MacBook Pro came out and even when iMac Pro came out,
[00:33:56.240 --> 00:34:01.600]   there was a lot of this sort of general ideas going around this floating idea that
[00:34:01.600 --> 00:34:03.680]   Apple isn't trying to work with pros anymore.
[00:34:03.680 --> 00:34:08.000]   Really, they absolutely were and did it this year.
[00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:09.920]   It just took them a while to make sure that they were,
[00:34:09.920 --> 00:34:14.320]   and really they made a mistake with the trashcan Mac Pro
[00:34:14.320 --> 00:34:16.400]   and they did not want to make that mistake again.
[00:34:16.400 --> 00:34:18.080]   That's why it took them so long.
[00:34:18.080 --> 00:34:21.440]   They wanted to make sure that you couldn't complain about anything.
[00:34:21.440 --> 00:34:24.400]   Of course, there's always something for people to complain about,
[00:34:24.400 --> 00:34:28.240]   but this is as close as you can get to having no one complain about it.
[00:34:28.240 --> 00:34:31.440]   Yeah, to their credit, they copped to that two years ago and they said,
[00:34:31.440 --> 00:34:33.680]   "We're going to have something in 2019.
[00:34:33.680 --> 00:34:36.080]   It's going to take us a while, but we're going to fix that."
[00:34:36.080 --> 00:34:37.600]   And they did.
[00:34:37.600 --> 00:34:42.960]   As Marco said in his post, "I'm optimistic for the first time in years.
[00:34:42.960 --> 00:34:46.080]   And for people like me who really love Mac OS, I am too.
[00:34:46.080 --> 00:34:48.960]   I just want to see some of these technologies trickle down
[00:34:48.960 --> 00:34:50.400]   into less expensive versions.
[00:34:50.400 --> 00:34:52.880]   I'd like to see Apple do other monitors, other displays.
[00:34:52.880 --> 00:34:56.240]   I would love to see a mini Mac Pro.
[00:34:56.240 --> 00:34:57.520]   I think that's a great idea."
[00:34:57.520 --> 00:35:02.800]   And I should mention, Waves demo was amazing because he had Toy Story 4.
[00:35:02.800 --> 00:35:04.880]   He had the set inside one of the little shops and he's like,
[00:35:04.880 --> 00:35:06.720]   "But you probably want to see outside the shop."
[00:35:06.720 --> 00:35:08.160]   So then suddenly you had the whole street.
[00:35:08.160 --> 00:35:11.280]   Then you probably want to see the entire fair and then the entire fair.
[00:35:11.280 --> 00:35:13.840]   But you probably want to see the whole region and then it zooms out
[00:35:13.840 --> 00:35:16.080]   and you see you're in the entire part of the world.
[00:35:16.080 --> 00:35:18.400]   And he was zooming in and out and around and up and down,
[00:35:18.400 --> 00:35:24.000]   all through Hydra, just zero lag, zero anything, amazing rendering capability.
[00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:29.040]   We're going to play our version, the Mac Break Weekly version of The Price is Right.
[00:35:29.040 --> 00:35:32.640]   And I'll let you start.
[00:35:32.640 --> 00:35:40.160]   I guess we should say full, well, do we want to say 1.5 terabyte of RAM?
[00:35:40.160 --> 00:35:42.560]   That's $20,000 by itself.
[00:35:43.520 --> 00:35:48.480]   Do we buy the highest NCPU directly from Intel at $7,500?
[00:35:48.480 --> 00:35:49.200]   Yeah.
[00:35:49.200 --> 00:35:54.240]   So actually the platinum version of the ZNW is $10,000.
[00:35:54.240 --> 00:35:57.840]   And there's even some ZNWs at $15,000.
[00:35:57.840 --> 00:35:59.040]   But that's 1Z2Z.
[00:35:59.040 --> 00:36:01.360]   Apple's not going to pay the 1Z2Z price.
[00:36:01.360 --> 00:36:06.480]   What do you think fully maxed out, including the XDR display, including the $1,000?
[00:36:06.480 --> 00:36:08.160]   How many XDR displays are there?
[00:36:08.160 --> 00:36:08.640]   Just one.
[00:36:08.640 --> 00:36:09.120]   Just one.
[00:36:09.120 --> 00:36:10.080]   We don't have to do it crazy.
[00:36:10.080 --> 00:36:11.760]   One display, one computer.
[00:36:11.760 --> 00:36:13.280]   But let's get the wheels.
[00:36:13.280 --> 00:36:14.640]   Let's get the wheels.
[00:36:14.640 --> 00:36:15.600]   Oh, man, the wheels.
[00:36:15.600 --> 00:36:16.640]   That's a wild card.
[00:36:16.640 --> 00:36:17.520]   It is a wild card.
[00:36:17.520 --> 00:36:18.800]   I'm going to say $5,000.
[00:36:18.800 --> 00:36:19.440]   $5,000 a wheel.
[00:36:19.440 --> 00:36:21.520]   No, $500 total for four wheels.
[00:36:21.520 --> 00:36:22.160]   That's what I'm going to say.
[00:36:22.160 --> 00:36:23.440]   $125 each.
[00:36:23.440 --> 00:36:25.920]   They could charge $1,000.
[00:36:25.920 --> 00:36:28.000]   But I think they'll be reasonable.
[00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:29.440]   What do you think the top--
[00:36:29.440 --> 00:36:33.440]   like if we go into the configurator and we could figure out the heck out of this,
[00:36:33.440 --> 00:36:34.000]   what do you think?
[00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:36.000]   I'm guessing 50.
[00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:40.160]   I mean, I think that's again, that's what these crazy YouTubers play for their cameras.
[00:36:40.160 --> 00:36:41.840]   And I figured that easily died.
[00:36:41.840 --> 00:36:43.840]   If you're buying it.
[00:36:43.840 --> 00:36:43.840]   Yeah.
[00:36:43.840 --> 00:36:45.040]   Yeah.
[00:36:45.040 --> 00:36:45.600]   Lori, what do you think?
[00:36:45.600 --> 00:36:46.080]   We're red.
[00:36:46.080 --> 00:36:47.280]   I mean--
[00:36:47.280 --> 00:36:47.280]   Yeah.
[00:36:47.280 --> 00:36:50.320]   I'm going to say--
[00:36:50.320 --> 00:36:54.880]   Are we maxing it out?
[00:36:54.880 --> 00:36:55.520]   Are we just--
[00:36:55.520 --> 00:36:56.400]   Yeah, fully maxed.
[00:36:56.400 --> 00:36:57.040]   One monitor.
[00:36:57.040 --> 00:36:58.240]   Fully maxed.
[00:36:58.240 --> 00:36:58.320]   Fully maxed.
[00:36:58.320 --> 00:37:00.000]   Fully maxed, I'm going to say $65.
[00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:02.160]   50, $65, Andy?
[00:37:02.160 --> 00:37:07.200]   If this were price is right, I would definitely go $50,000 and $1.
[00:37:07.200 --> 00:37:11.040]   Because I think it's higher than Renee's.
[00:37:11.040 --> 00:37:12.480]   I think it's lower than--
[00:37:12.480 --> 00:37:13.760]   You haven't heard mine yet.
[00:37:13.760 --> 00:37:15.680]   I would see--
[00:37:15.680 --> 00:37:17.200]   Yeah, because you can do $50,000 and $2,000.
[00:37:17.200 --> 00:37:19.280]   Damn it, that's why you always do that when you have your last--
[00:37:19.280 --> 00:37:19.840]   They're fine.
[00:37:19.840 --> 00:37:19.840]   Yeah.
[00:37:19.840 --> 00:37:20.560]   I would say--
[00:37:20.560 --> 00:37:23.120]   I would say about $55,000.
[00:37:23.120 --> 00:37:24.880]   I think it's a little bit higher than $50,000.
[00:37:24.880 --> 00:37:26.320]   I'm going to say it's a lot higher.
[00:37:26.320 --> 00:37:32.000]   Because $20,000 for the RAM, let's say $10,000 for the CPU is $30,000.
[00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:35.520]   If I'm going to put two of those promise sleds in there,
[00:37:35.520 --> 00:37:38.160]   I'm going to--
[00:37:38.160 --> 00:37:38.720]   I don't know.
[00:37:38.720 --> 00:37:39.840]   I'm going to say more like--
[00:37:39.840 --> 00:37:43.840]   Will the promise be in the configurator or is that going to be aftermarket?
[00:37:43.840 --> 00:37:44.880]   Is that an aftermarket?
[00:37:44.880 --> 00:37:46.240]   I feel like Apple announced it.
[00:37:46.240 --> 00:37:48.640]   Yeah, but I don't know if it'll be in the configurator.
[00:37:48.640 --> 00:37:50.000]   That might be in the accessory section.
[00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:50.800]   All right.
[00:37:50.800 --> 00:37:51.120]   All right.
[00:37:51.120 --> 00:37:53.200]   We won't put that in there, but we will put in four,
[00:37:53.200 --> 00:37:56.000]   count them four Vega Pro cards.
[00:37:56.000 --> 00:37:57.760]   Oh, that's true.
[00:37:57.760 --> 00:37:59.920]   And four terabyte SSDs are going to be--
[00:37:59.920 --> 00:38:00.560]   Yeah.
[00:38:00.560 --> 00:38:01.120]   Yeah.
[00:38:01.120 --> 00:38:04.160]   I'm going to go over 50.
[00:38:04.160 --> 00:38:05.680]   I'm sure it's going over 50.
[00:38:06.320 --> 00:38:12.880]   I think maybe I'm 100 leaps to mind, but I can't possibly be that high, right?
[00:38:12.880 --> 00:38:15.280]   But honestly, this guy's the limit.
[00:38:15.280 --> 00:38:23.040]   It definitely tempts you to figure out how much does it weigh in that configuration,
[00:38:23.040 --> 00:38:27.520]   and what precious metal could this be made out of where it would actually cost less.
[00:38:27.520 --> 00:38:30.720]   That's more than silver, maybe more than--
[00:38:30.720 --> 00:38:33.360]   Oh, and by the way, that case.
[00:38:34.160 --> 00:38:37.600]   And the way you can lift it, and it's all open.
[00:38:37.600 --> 00:38:41.520]   I asked them because my Nihilla Mac Pro,
[00:38:41.520 --> 00:38:43.840]   a friend of mine has put a Westmere editor ready,
[00:38:43.840 --> 00:38:46.800]   but it's lasted 10 years, and it's still awesome.
[00:38:46.800 --> 00:38:47.440]   It's good to--
[00:38:47.440 --> 00:38:49.600]   It's good to Mac as any Mac you can buy today.
[00:38:49.600 --> 00:38:51.040]   And this has really been a built-in.
[00:38:51.040 --> 00:38:52.000]   Yeah.
[00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:54.160]   This is built so that you can upgrade it for 10 years.
[00:38:54.160 --> 00:38:55.840]   Can you upgrade the CPUs, too?
[00:38:55.840 --> 00:38:56.960]   Can you upgrade the CPU?
[00:38:56.960 --> 00:39:00.240]   I'm determined because I think a lot of that depends on what Intel does with the--
[00:39:00.240 --> 00:39:00.640]   Right.
[00:39:00.640 --> 00:39:01.600]   --with the CPUs.
[00:39:02.160 --> 00:39:05.600]   But I think theoretically, you could upgrade some of the Cheeseburger CPUs.
[00:39:05.600 --> 00:39:08.320]   Yes. We looked into that.
[00:39:08.320 --> 00:39:11.280]   There is a limit because of the socket and the bus and all this.
[00:39:11.280 --> 00:39:11.840]   Yeah.
[00:39:11.840 --> 00:39:14.160]   The socket isn't enclosed in a module, right?
[00:39:14.160 --> 00:39:15.920]   I feel like you could--
[00:39:15.920 --> 00:39:18.240]   There's no-- is there a logic board, a motherboard?
[00:39:18.240 --> 00:39:18.880]   No.
[00:39:18.880 --> 00:39:20.240]   There's a backplane, I think.
[00:39:20.240 --> 00:39:21.520]   There's a backplane.
[00:39:21.520 --> 00:39:22.480]   I think there's a backplane.
[00:39:22.480 --> 00:39:27.360]   And that's where that fabric works to connect this stuff.
[00:39:27.360 --> 00:39:30.240]   I feel like what you created is this amazing high-speed bus
[00:39:31.120 --> 00:39:32.560]   that you can plug anything into.
[00:39:32.560 --> 00:39:35.440]   I mean, it really is very impressive.
[00:39:35.440 --> 00:39:38.800]   They were comparing it to Red because with Red,
[00:39:38.800 --> 00:39:40.400]   you spend a ton of money to get the camera,
[00:39:40.400 --> 00:39:41.680]   but you can't take photos with it.
[00:39:41.680 --> 00:39:44.880]   Then you've got to get the memory module and mounting module.
[00:39:44.880 --> 00:39:48.480]   And Jonathan was saying his handle for his 500-up bucks,
[00:39:48.480 --> 00:39:50.320]   and that's just the tiny grip bar that you want.
[00:39:50.320 --> 00:39:52.000]   But that's what pros want.
[00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:55.920]   Because pros want to configure it precisely for the job they're doing.
[00:39:55.920 --> 00:39:58.240]   So the hassle bledge is all about you.
[00:39:58.240 --> 00:40:01.520]   It's the hassle bledge in a box with no lens, no film receiver,
[00:40:01.520 --> 00:40:03.200]   no winder, no nothing.
[00:40:03.200 --> 00:40:04.720]   But here's the interesting question.
[00:40:04.720 --> 00:40:08.960]   It was brought up on Mac Brick Weekly a couple of weeks ago or last week.
[00:40:08.960 --> 00:40:11.440]   And you weren't hearing it.
[00:40:11.440 --> 00:40:12.160]   And you weren't hearing it, Laurie.
[00:40:12.160 --> 00:40:14.240]   So I'll give you guys the first dibs at this one.
[00:40:14.240 --> 00:40:17.760]   What happens if Apple does an arm, you know, gets off Intel?
[00:40:17.760 --> 00:40:21.920]   I mean, I don't think--
[00:40:21.920 --> 00:40:24.560]   Zion is probably the last of the Intel that they get off of.
[00:40:24.560 --> 00:40:27.760]   And their solution to that is probably going to have to be creative.
[00:40:27.760 --> 00:40:28.720]   I mean, I could eat my words.
[00:40:28.720 --> 00:40:31.200]   They could say, hey, for the last 10 years, we've been working on
[00:40:31.200 --> 00:40:33.280]   ARM-based server architectures.
[00:40:33.280 --> 00:40:33.760]   Here they are.
[00:40:33.760 --> 00:40:35.040]   But I think--
[00:40:35.040 --> 00:40:37.600]   Yeah, how do you feel about 64 ARM cores?
[00:40:37.600 --> 00:40:38.080]   Huh?
[00:40:38.080 --> 00:40:38.960]   Now, how do you feel?
[00:40:38.960 --> 00:40:39.920]   Now, what do you say?
[00:40:39.920 --> 00:40:42.400]   But I think Zion is probably the most resilient of--
[00:40:42.400 --> 00:40:44.560]   like, if you're going to buy Intel at this point, Zion is--
[00:40:44.560 --> 00:40:44.560]   Right.
[00:40:44.560 --> 00:40:48.560]   And actually, the subsystems are just as important as the microprocessor
[00:40:48.560 --> 00:40:49.440]   in something like this.
[00:40:49.440 --> 00:40:53.120]   You aren't even really looking for high clock speeds as much as you are,
[00:40:53.120 --> 00:40:54.160]   just for integration.
[00:40:54.160 --> 00:40:55.040]   And the GPUs.
[00:40:55.040 --> 00:40:56.240]   And these are Cascade lakes.
[00:40:56.240 --> 00:40:59.280]   So I mean, they're still on the 14 nanometer process,
[00:40:59.280 --> 00:41:03.360]   but they were announced the same day Apple now for myself.
[00:41:03.360 --> 00:41:07.120]   If I'm just going to spend, let's say, $50,000 on something,
[00:41:07.120 --> 00:41:10.960]   it would be problematic if I thought in three years it would be
[00:41:10.960 --> 00:41:14.720]   obsoleteed by a change in microprocessor architecture.
[00:41:14.720 --> 00:41:17.120]   There'll always be something new, though.
[00:41:17.120 --> 00:41:19.920]   And these machines are designed to last so long that you probably hit that--
[00:41:19.920 --> 00:41:22.960]   Like, even if you bought it last year or the year before you still hit that.
[00:41:22.960 --> 00:41:23.440]   Yeah.
[00:41:23.440 --> 00:41:26.640]   Ironically, the people who spend the most on computers are the ones who care
[00:41:26.640 --> 00:41:27.760]   least about longevity.
[00:41:27.760 --> 00:41:29.360]   Well, they lease them, right?
[00:41:29.360 --> 00:41:31.760]   Like, they lease them for here, too, in the go back to the leasing company.
[00:41:31.760 --> 00:41:32.160]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:41:32.160 --> 00:41:34.720]   And that's when we're going to be able to get one.
[00:41:34.720 --> 00:41:37.280]   It's like a Tesla.
[00:41:37.280 --> 00:41:37.760]   I can get the--
[00:41:37.760 --> 00:41:38.960]   I might slightly use--
[00:41:38.960 --> 00:41:40.880]   I might see flea market 2029.
[00:41:40.880 --> 00:41:42.080]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:41:42.080 --> 00:41:43.200]   $80.
[00:41:43.200 --> 00:41:45.120]   Oh, Andy.
[00:41:45.120 --> 00:41:48.240]   And I will count on you to pick one up for me when you see it.
[00:41:48.240 --> 00:41:49.840]   Turn them into hamster cages.
[00:41:49.840 --> 00:41:51.840]   It reminds me the way the caselift's offering.
[00:41:51.840 --> 00:41:53.040]   It'll remind me a little bit of the cube.
[00:41:53.040 --> 00:41:54.000]   The cube kind of--
[00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:54.640]   Yeah, so nice.
[00:41:54.640 --> 00:41:55.040]   Oh, nice.
[00:41:55.040 --> 00:41:55.440]   Exactly.
[00:41:55.440 --> 00:41:55.760]   Yeah.
[00:41:55.760 --> 00:41:57.600]   All four sides.
[00:41:57.600 --> 00:41:58.080]   It's amazing.
[00:41:58.080 --> 00:41:59.440]   Oh, it's just so sweet.
[00:41:59.440 --> 00:42:02.480]   Thank you, Apple, for really, really--
[00:42:02.480 --> 00:42:03.600]   I think really listening.
[00:42:03.600 --> 00:42:04.720]   I think they did.
[00:42:04.720 --> 00:42:11.920]   And I think all the quibbles about price and all that are really misplaced at this point,
[00:42:11.920 --> 00:42:15.200]   because this is what Apple's saying, look, what if price were no object?
[00:42:15.200 --> 00:42:16.640]   How good could we make this computer?
[00:42:16.640 --> 00:42:17.120]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:42:17.120 --> 00:42:18.240]   Did you see Marko's--
[00:42:18.240 --> 00:42:18.720]   I was reading from--
[00:42:18.720 --> 00:42:21.600]   We have people in our marketing database that actually fits that description.
[00:42:21.600 --> 00:42:22.400]   So we can do that.
[00:42:22.400 --> 00:42:23.440]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:42:23.440 --> 00:42:27.360]   Did you see Marko's tweet from the hands-on area when he sees Johnny and Tim?
[00:42:27.360 --> 00:42:27.600]   No.
[00:42:27.600 --> 00:42:29.120]   Oh, yeah.
[00:42:29.120 --> 00:42:30.800]   He put on-- it was the same day as the event.
[00:42:30.800 --> 00:42:32.160]   And he just sees Johnny and Tim.
[00:42:32.160 --> 00:42:33.280]   And he's like, you killed it.
[00:42:33.280 --> 00:42:33.840]   You killed it.
[00:42:33.840 --> 00:42:36.880]   And Johnny doesn't know how to react, but Tim puts his hands together and says,
[00:42:36.880 --> 00:42:37.360]   thank you.
[00:42:37.360 --> 00:42:37.760]   Thank you.
[00:42:37.760 --> 00:42:38.960]   And he just says, you killed it.
[00:42:38.960 --> 00:42:39.680]   You killed it.
[00:42:39.680 --> 00:42:40.800]   It was just a beautiful moment.
[00:42:40.800 --> 00:42:44.000]   Oh, for people like--
[00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:48.800]   like, I think all of us, but certainly Andy and me who go back a few years.
[00:42:48.800 --> 00:42:50.880]   I love Mac OS.
[00:42:50.880 --> 00:42:59.040]   And I was-- I have been very sad for some time that they didn't seem to appreciate
[00:42:59.040 --> 00:43:01.040]   as much as we who loved it so much.
[00:43:01.040 --> 00:43:05.280]   Marko says something changed around 2017.
[00:43:05.280 --> 00:43:06.160]   Yeah.
[00:43:06.160 --> 00:43:10.560]   That there was something big changed around 2017.
[00:43:10.560 --> 00:43:17.920]   And perhaps it was the trash can combined with a keyboard combined with the touch bar combined with,
[00:43:17.920 --> 00:43:18.960]   you know.
[00:43:20.400 --> 00:43:24.400]   I'll still say that they're excited about pro users.
[00:43:24.400 --> 00:43:30.880]   They haven't shown as much enthusiasm for the people who have the need for your medium
[00:43:30.880 --> 00:43:34.000]   to low-powered sort of computing.
[00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:37.760]   I do think that they still think that, geez, what are these freaks doing,
[00:43:37.760 --> 00:43:40.240]   still buying a desktop machine?
[00:43:40.240 --> 00:43:43.520]   We need to get these people convinced that they can buy iPads instead.
[00:43:43.520 --> 00:43:47.840]   So I've seen some good stuff in Catalina, which please go on.
[00:43:48.400 --> 00:43:54.000]   But I still think that I really still want to see a lot of enthusiasm jumping up on the stage,
[00:43:54.000 --> 00:44:00.480]   renting your garments like Brandy Chesty after scoring the goal about Mac OS.
[00:44:00.480 --> 00:44:02.320]   I think that that's still to come.
[00:44:02.320 --> 00:44:05.680]   I think this was-- they had to do this.
[00:44:05.680 --> 00:44:07.200]   This was the planning of the flag.
[00:44:07.200 --> 00:44:08.000]   I am very excited.
[00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:11.120]   We're going to take a break and come back and talk about iPadOS.
[00:44:11.120 --> 00:44:13.120]   That's a seat change as well.
[00:44:13.120 --> 00:44:14.640]   I think you-- Renee wrote a lot--
[00:44:14.640 --> 00:44:16.720]   I want to hear Andy's reaction to the New York Times--
[00:44:16.720 --> 00:44:17.840]   sorry, the New York font.
[00:44:17.840 --> 00:44:19.600]   We've got San Francisco and New York now.
[00:44:19.600 --> 00:44:21.840]   - New York is back, baby.
[00:44:21.840 --> 00:44:23.120]   - It's a serif.
[00:44:23.120 --> 00:44:25.040]   - Can Geneva be far behind?
[00:44:25.040 --> 00:44:36.800]   And then, of course, I'd love to talk a little bit about other editions in iOS 13 and Mac OS.
[00:44:36.800 --> 00:44:41.040]   Did they say the name Catalina, but is it going to be Mac OS 10.15?
[00:44:41.040 --> 00:44:42.800]   - It is internally.
[00:44:42.800 --> 00:44:43.440]   It's 10.15.
[00:44:43.440 --> 00:44:47.520]   - Yeah.
[00:44:47.520 --> 00:44:50.400]   - I cannot wait to get my hands on SwiftUI.
[00:44:50.400 --> 00:44:54.320]   In fact, honestly, this will be probably the first time in a couple of years that I'll do
[00:44:54.320 --> 00:44:59.040]   the public beta on both Mac OS and iOS because they actually gave us a briefing with Josh,
[00:44:59.040 --> 00:45:02.240]   who created SwiftUI, which was really fun to watch.
[00:45:02.240 --> 00:45:04.080]   - We're going to talk about all of that just a second.
[00:45:04.080 --> 00:45:05.280]   Lori Gill is here.
[00:45:05.280 --> 00:45:07.200]   She of the purple hair.
[00:45:07.200 --> 00:45:11.120]   You know, did you tell your hair to match the Mac Break Weekly color?
[00:45:11.120 --> 00:45:13.200]   Because now you go right.
[00:45:13.200 --> 00:45:13.920]   - Yes, I did.
[00:45:13.920 --> 00:45:18.000]   - You go just with that loreth and so beautifully, and our purple lights behind us.
[00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:19.200]   You just fit right in.
[00:45:19.200 --> 00:45:20.560]   Thank you, Lori.
[00:45:20.560 --> 00:45:22.160]   - That's exactly what this was about.
[00:45:22.160 --> 00:45:25.520]   It's in celebration of my join in the team.
[00:45:25.520 --> 00:45:26.400]   - Yes.
[00:45:26.400 --> 00:45:31.360]   And I should say you are officially now a member of the team, so much so that you will be invited
[00:45:31.360 --> 00:45:32.320]   to the Christmas party.
[00:45:32.320 --> 00:45:33.280]   - Yes.
[00:45:33.280 --> 00:45:36.160]   - But I will come as long as there's not already something happening.
[00:45:36.160 --> 00:45:36.880]   I will be there.
[00:45:36.880 --> 00:45:38.640]   - Carefully or she's in the book.
[00:45:38.640 --> 00:45:38.800]   - She's in the book.
[00:45:38.800 --> 00:45:39.280]   - She'll be there.
[00:45:39.280 --> 00:45:40.400]   - We're going to have to.
[00:45:40.400 --> 00:45:42.960]   We're going to have to mail out a save the date for crying out loud.
[00:45:42.960 --> 00:45:44.080]   She's a busy person.
[00:45:44.080 --> 00:45:44.560]   - Yeah.
[00:45:44.560 --> 00:45:44.960]   - All right.
[00:45:44.960 --> 00:45:46.320]   Have you sent her her--
[00:45:46.320 --> 00:45:47.040]   - Like I made sure she was to play.
[00:45:47.040 --> 00:45:52.240]   - You got to make sure she gets her ceremonial took and saber now that she's officially a member
[00:45:52.240 --> 00:45:52.560]   of the family.
[00:45:52.560 --> 00:45:53.680]   - She probably get a FES at least.
[00:45:53.680 --> 00:45:54.400]   - It's a FES, yeah.
[00:45:54.400 --> 00:45:56.800]   - Andy and I go Chicago.
[00:45:56.800 --> 00:45:57.360]   I'm sorry.
[00:45:57.360 --> 00:45:58.640]   Boston Public.
[00:45:58.640 --> 00:45:58.960]   - Formally.
[00:45:58.960 --> 00:45:59.360]   - Formally.
[00:45:59.360 --> 00:45:59.760]   - Formally.
[00:45:59.760 --> 00:46:01.680]   - Now a Boston Public Radio.
[00:46:01.680 --> 00:46:04.480]   And you are in a different library carol.
[00:46:04.480 --> 00:46:07.040]   Did you take over the whole library, the reading room here?
[00:46:07.040 --> 00:46:07.840]   - Gorgeous.
[00:46:07.840 --> 00:46:12.800]   - No, this is an even better conference room that you can reserve on a website and stuff.
[00:46:12.800 --> 00:46:18.960]   I promise you I will get to getting my internet stuff sorted.
[00:46:18.960 --> 00:46:19.440]   - No.
[00:46:19.440 --> 00:46:20.960]   - Yeah, exactly.
[00:46:20.960 --> 00:46:22.800]   There are so many really good--
[00:46:22.800 --> 00:46:26.160]   Because I'm now in quote, like a downtown part of town,
[00:46:26.160 --> 00:46:29.760]   it's kind of now soothing that I can still--
[00:46:29.760 --> 00:46:34.240]   I can work eight to 10 hours a day, but then when I get home,
[00:46:34.240 --> 00:46:35.120]   it's like, no, no, no.
[00:46:35.120 --> 00:46:38.080]   This is a place where you listen to music that's on your device.
[00:46:38.080 --> 00:46:39.840]   You're going to read a paper book.
[00:46:39.840 --> 00:46:40.640]   You're going to--
[00:46:40.640 --> 00:46:41.040]   - Wow.
[00:46:41.040 --> 00:46:42.240]   - It's like, it's kind of--
[00:46:42.240 --> 00:46:45.520]   Again, I will get on that, but it's like,
[00:46:45.520 --> 00:46:48.480]   I kind of like having to get dressed up and go to work in the morning.
[00:46:48.480 --> 00:46:50.880]   But still have to--
[00:46:50.880 --> 00:46:52.080]   And again, it's--
[00:46:52.080 --> 00:46:56.720]   I don't have to clean my office because the libraries keep their rooms very clean.
[00:46:56.720 --> 00:46:58.080]   Look, we've got ship models.
[00:46:58.080 --> 00:47:00.640]   I don't have ship models in my house.
[00:47:00.640 --> 00:47:03.040]   - This is so awesome.
[00:47:03.040 --> 00:47:04.160]   This is so beautiful.
[00:47:04.160 --> 00:47:05.200]   Please don't go home.
[00:47:05.200 --> 00:47:05.840]   - Don't go home.
[00:47:05.840 --> 00:47:06.480]   - I'm going to--
[00:47:06.480 --> 00:47:06.960]   Exactly.
[00:47:06.960 --> 00:47:09.520]   If anything, I'm going to just basically take a picture of this.
[00:47:09.520 --> 00:47:11.280]   And worse comes the worst.
[00:47:11.280 --> 00:47:11.600]   - Yes.
[00:47:11.600 --> 00:47:14.160]   - Use this as a background plate in my office for now on.
[00:47:14.160 --> 00:47:14.640]   - Yeah.
[00:47:14.640 --> 00:47:21.200]   And Renee Ritchie from MyMore, also back from WWDC.
[00:47:21.200 --> 00:47:27.360]   And he's accepting the top offers for his Black on Black WWDC jacket.
[00:47:27.360 --> 00:47:28.960]   - Max accept.
[00:47:28.960 --> 00:47:30.800]   - The reserve bid is $5,000.
[00:47:30.800 --> 00:47:32.480]   - Actually--
[00:47:32.480 --> 00:47:32.480]   - Actually--
[00:47:32.480 --> 00:47:32.960]   - I'm not sure.
[00:47:32.960 --> 00:47:33.600]   - I got a report.
[00:47:33.600 --> 00:47:34.000]   - Exactly.
[00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:35.520]   Let's set it to the Mac Pro price.
[00:47:35.520 --> 00:47:36.400]   $6,000.
[00:47:36.400 --> 00:47:41.040]   You know, I looked back because I had bought the iMac Pro when it came out.
[00:47:41.040 --> 00:47:44.880]   And that was an iWattering $5,000 start price.
[00:47:44.880 --> 00:47:47.440]   But thinking I can blame you, Renee, because you said,
[00:47:47.440 --> 00:47:47.920]   "Oh, no, no.
[00:47:47.920 --> 00:47:49.360]   Well, the one you want is 10 cores."
[00:47:49.360 --> 00:47:53.680]   So I looked back and it was $7,199.
[00:47:53.680 --> 00:47:55.520]   So I'm not going to buy this.
[00:47:55.520 --> 00:47:56.160]   - I knew what you wanted.
[00:47:56.160 --> 00:47:56.480]   - Yeah.
[00:47:56.480 --> 00:47:56.880]   - Yeah.
[00:47:56.880 --> 00:47:58.720]   I'm not going to buy the Mac Pro, but--
[00:47:58.720 --> 00:47:59.920]   I love the iMac Pro.
[00:47:59.920 --> 00:48:00.960]   And then Marco even said that.
[00:48:00.960 --> 00:48:02.320]   I don't know if he's going to buy a Mac Pro.
[00:48:02.320 --> 00:48:02.960]   - Yeah.
[00:48:02.960 --> 00:48:03.680]   He could afford it.
[00:48:03.680 --> 00:48:04.080]   - Yeah.
[00:48:04.080 --> 00:48:06.800]   Isn't it amazing we're talking about like $6,000 computers.
[00:48:06.800 --> 00:48:09.600]   And that's with like the cloth interior and the factory stereo.
[00:48:09.600 --> 00:48:11.360]   (laughing)
[00:48:11.360 --> 00:48:11.760]   - All right.
[00:48:11.760 --> 00:48:15.200]   - Well, it was someone, I forget who someone went and did the price of all the Macs over time.
[00:48:15.200 --> 00:48:16.800]   And like some of them were like 14, like even like,
[00:48:16.800 --> 00:48:18.560]   "Rinky Dinky" ones were like $14,000.
[00:48:18.560 --> 00:48:22.240]   - I have a two FX motherboard hanging in a nice frame.
[00:48:22.240 --> 00:48:25.600]   That thing, FX stand for freaking expensive was,
[00:48:25.600 --> 00:48:29.120]   I think close to $10,000 when it came out.
[00:48:29.120 --> 00:48:30.560]   So this is nothing.
[00:48:30.560 --> 00:48:32.000]   This isn't really anything new.
[00:48:32.240 --> 00:48:36.960]   The $2,500 I spent for my very first Mac, the original 128K Mac,
[00:48:36.960 --> 00:48:43.760]   back in 1984 in today's dollars, probably is close to $5,000 or $6,000.
[00:48:43.760 --> 00:48:48.000]   These things were always been expensive, but they've always also been.
[00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:51.600]   And this is why I'm so grateful to Apple, the best you can get.
[00:48:51.600 --> 00:48:53.280]   And I think that's what Apple has done again.
[00:48:53.280 --> 00:48:57.520]   It's that this is the best computer, best micro computer you can get.
[00:48:57.520 --> 00:48:59.280]   It's a crayon out loud.
[00:48:59.280 --> 00:49:00.880]   It's a cray.
[00:49:00.880 --> 00:49:02.080]   It's a super computer.
[00:49:02.080 --> 00:49:04.960]   I mean, it's amazing and it looks good too.
[00:49:04.960 --> 00:49:08.720]   - Or should you do some of those RGB LEDs around the fan?
[00:49:08.720 --> 00:49:10.000]   Like you can't really keep me.
[00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:11.280]   - I'm so glad they don't do that.
[00:49:11.280 --> 00:49:13.120]   - Oh man, I hate that stuff.
[00:49:13.120 --> 00:49:13.920]   - Just clap it up.
[00:49:13.920 --> 00:49:15.600]   Just clap it up.
[00:49:15.600 --> 00:49:18.400]   I bought a gaming PC for Michael, our 16 year old.
[00:49:18.400 --> 00:49:20.000]   And man, the thing, it's so silly.
[00:49:20.000 --> 00:49:22.240]   It looks like a UFO landed on his desk, you know?
[00:49:22.240 --> 00:49:23.440]   It's so silly.
[00:49:23.440 --> 00:49:24.720]   - It's perfect for Pride Month though.
[00:49:24.720 --> 00:49:25.280]   - Oh yeah.
[00:49:25.280 --> 00:49:26.960]   - The color is very much rainbow.
[00:49:26.960 --> 00:49:29.760]   Our show today brought to you by ExpressVPN,
[00:49:29.760 --> 00:49:33.520]   whatever kind of computer you're using or phone or mobile device,
[00:49:33.520 --> 00:49:36.560]   you should be using a VPN whenever you're out in public
[00:49:36.560 --> 00:49:38.560]   at those open Wi-Fi access points.
[00:49:38.560 --> 00:49:40.720]   You are vulnerable.
[00:49:40.720 --> 00:49:44.480]   Even at home, you're being snooped on by your internet service provider
[00:49:44.480 --> 00:49:45.440]   or your carrier.
[00:49:45.440 --> 00:49:50.960]   You need a virtual private network, something encrypts all your traffic,
[00:49:50.960 --> 00:49:53.600]   keeps the snoops out, protects you from getting hacked,
[00:49:53.600 --> 00:49:56.160]   makes everything private.
[00:49:56.160 --> 00:49:58.480]   And that's so that's a VPN.
[00:49:58.480 --> 00:50:01.040]   I think everybody here knows about VPNs.
[00:50:01.040 --> 00:50:04.480]   But often the question, which VPN should I get?
[00:50:04.480 --> 00:50:06.240]   Sometimes people say, "Well, I can run my own VPN."
[00:50:06.240 --> 00:50:08.960]   But that's not going to give you the same benefit because,
[00:50:08.960 --> 00:50:11.120]   first of all, your own VPN is coming out of your house.
[00:50:11.120 --> 00:50:13.280]   So your ISP will now see what you're doing.
[00:50:13.280 --> 00:50:17.520]   And it's hard to run a VPN and bandwidth is an issue.
[00:50:17.520 --> 00:50:19.600]   You don't have that much upstream bandwidth.
[00:50:19.600 --> 00:50:23.840]   ExpressVPN has a lot of bandwidth and it has servers all over the world.
[00:50:23.840 --> 00:50:27.280]   So you can emerge into the public internet completely privately.
[00:50:27.920 --> 00:50:31.520]   Your IP address is obfuscated.
[00:50:31.520 --> 00:50:33.600]   Your browsing is anonymized.
[00:50:33.600 --> 00:50:35.840]   And you can be anywhere in the world.
[00:50:35.840 --> 00:50:37.680]   So there's no more geographic restrictions.
[00:50:37.680 --> 00:50:41.200]   Plus ExpressVPN is as easy as can be.
[00:50:41.200 --> 00:50:42.880]   They've got apps for every platform.
[00:50:42.880 --> 00:50:45.920]   You have one button click that turns the VPN on.
[00:50:45.920 --> 00:50:47.440]   And when you're ready to turn it off, turns it off.
[00:50:47.440 --> 00:50:50.640]   And this is why ExpressVPN is not free.
[00:50:50.640 --> 00:50:52.720]   They've got a lot of bandwidth.
[00:50:52.720 --> 00:50:55.200]   A lot of servers and a lot of bandwidth means you can use a VPN
[00:50:55.200 --> 00:50:56.240]   without suffering.
[00:50:56.240 --> 00:51:00.560]   It's fast, but it's safe and it's private.
[00:51:00.560 --> 00:51:04.080]   And it is, after all, not that expensive, less than $7 a month.
[00:51:04.080 --> 00:51:09.040]   And I think that's a very good deal for a VPN service that does not log,
[00:51:09.040 --> 00:51:11.680]   does not keep track of you, anonymizes everything,
[00:51:11.680 --> 00:51:13.760]   and is fast and easy to use.
[00:51:13.760 --> 00:51:15.600]   This is why you want to express VPN.
[00:51:15.600 --> 00:51:17.920]   And by the way, if it doesn't meet your needs,
[00:51:17.920 --> 00:51:19.760]   they have a 30-day money-back guarantee.
[00:51:19.760 --> 00:51:21.680]   So there's no risk at all.
[00:51:21.680 --> 00:51:23.280]   Protect your online activity today.
[00:51:23.280 --> 00:51:24.400]   Use the VPN I use.
[00:51:24.400 --> 00:51:27.360]   The one that was rated number one on TechRadar.
[00:51:27.360 --> 00:51:32.000]   And if you use our special address, not only will you be telling them you heard it here,
[00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:35.120]   which is very helpful for us, you'll be getting three extra months free
[00:51:35.120 --> 00:51:36.400]   with your one-year package.
[00:51:36.400 --> 00:51:37.520]   That's the best deal.
[00:51:37.520 --> 00:51:40.560]   ExpressVPN.com/Macbreak.
[00:51:40.560 --> 00:51:42.800]   Express VPN.
[00:51:42.800 --> 00:51:50.000]   Expresssvpn.com/Macbreak for three extra months free with a one-year package
[00:51:50.000 --> 00:51:53.040]   and 30-day money-back guarantee.
[00:51:53.040 --> 00:51:57.440]   ExpressVPN.com/Macbreak.
[00:51:57.440 --> 00:51:59.280]   I'm very happy with ExpressVPN.
[00:51:59.280 --> 00:52:02.080]   You don't need, maybe necessarily need it all the time,
[00:52:02.080 --> 00:52:03.680]   but when you need it, it's so good to have it.
[00:52:03.680 --> 00:52:07.920]   Andy and I call Renee Ritchie, Lori Gill.
[00:52:07.920 --> 00:52:10.160]   There is so much to talk about today.
[00:52:10.160 --> 00:52:11.440]   Apple laid so much on us.
[00:52:11.440 --> 00:52:13.520]   And of course, it wasn't all in the keynote.
[00:52:13.520 --> 00:52:15.600]   In fact, that's why I'm going to count on you, Lori,
[00:52:15.600 --> 00:52:20.640]   and you Renee to supplement because there was a lot more announced about iOS 13
[00:52:20.640 --> 00:52:23.680]   and Mac OS Catalina.
[00:52:23.680 --> 00:52:26.480]   Public betas for both are next months.
[00:52:26.480 --> 00:52:29.360]   That's all we know next month.
[00:52:29.360 --> 00:52:32.960]   Have you, either of you, started using the developer edition?
[00:52:32.960 --> 00:52:34.880]   Of course.
[00:52:34.880 --> 00:52:35.600]   You are.
[00:52:35.600 --> 00:52:36.160]   I'm both.
[00:52:36.160 --> 00:52:37.280]   Oh, yeah.
[00:52:37.280 --> 00:52:37.840]   Oh, yeah.
[00:52:37.840 --> 00:52:41.120]   Now, I just talked to Rosemary Orchard, and she said,
[00:52:41.120 --> 00:52:46.080]   iOS 13 is back to its a little bit unstable.
[00:52:46.080 --> 00:52:48.640]   She said, "I would not necessarily recommend it on a production machine.
[00:52:48.640 --> 00:52:49.200]   Would you agree?"
[00:52:50.080 --> 00:52:53.200]   I, for the first year, I didn't put it on my primary stuff because I saw
[00:52:53.200 --> 00:52:56.000]   like people who would know going through the hall of just just shaking their heads.
[00:52:56.000 --> 00:52:56.320]   Yeah.
[00:52:56.320 --> 00:52:57.360]   Just don't.
[00:52:57.360 --> 00:52:57.920]   No.
[00:52:57.920 --> 00:52:58.000]   No.
[00:52:58.000 --> 00:53:04.880]   Do you think it'll be better if in the public beta, like it'll be more,
[00:53:04.880 --> 00:53:07.280]   yes, it's only a month off, but I guess it's deliberately so.
[00:53:07.280 --> 00:53:07.600]   Okay.
[00:53:07.600 --> 00:53:10.880]   Because I really want to do this stuff.
[00:53:10.880 --> 00:53:12.080]   There's so much I want to try.
[00:53:12.080 --> 00:53:14.480]   Rosemary is the expert.
[00:53:14.480 --> 00:53:18.720]   Of course, I'm Max Shortcuts and it sounds like iOS 13 will have a lot of
[00:53:19.440 --> 00:53:24.880]   really beef up shortcuts by giving you the shortcut creator direct access to a lot of
[00:53:24.880 --> 00:53:28.320]   of the sensors and so forth on iOS.
[00:53:28.320 --> 00:53:30.240]   That's going to be a big difference.
[00:53:30.240 --> 00:53:32.640]   And it's conversational so it can take parameters,
[00:53:32.640 --> 00:53:35.600]   which everyone was yelling hallelujah for right after they said it.
[00:53:35.600 --> 00:53:36.560]   So tell me about that.
[00:53:36.560 --> 00:53:39.920]   So, so shortcuts, you can't have parameters in the shortcut.
[00:53:39.920 --> 00:53:42.000]   The original ones, like you would just tell it what to do,
[00:53:42.000 --> 00:53:43.600]   but I couldn't ask you questions back.
[00:53:43.600 --> 00:53:44.000]   Oh.
[00:53:44.000 --> 00:53:45.760]   In the new version, you could say, for example,
[00:53:47.120 --> 00:53:51.120]   order dinner from Pizza Queen and it'll say, which of your last four orders do you want?
[00:53:51.120 --> 00:53:52.800]   The pepperoni, the Hawaiian and Nutella.
[00:53:52.800 --> 00:53:53.360]   It's interactive.
[00:53:53.360 --> 00:53:54.320]   And it goes off and does it.
[00:53:54.320 --> 00:53:54.560]   Yeah.
[00:53:54.560 --> 00:53:58.400]   Any good scripting language will have commands to say, okay, now find out.
[00:53:58.400 --> 00:54:00.160]   Follow up here.
[00:54:00.160 --> 00:54:01.120]   And so now it can do that.
[00:54:01.120 --> 00:54:02.160]   That's a big deal.
[00:54:02.160 --> 00:54:04.160]   And two other really cool things.
[00:54:04.160 --> 00:54:06.800]   Siri kit has got support for maps now so that anything you could do,
[00:54:06.800 --> 00:54:10.960]   as long as the developers add support, you can use ways or you can use Google Maps,
[00:54:10.960 --> 00:54:12.960]   the same way you use Apple Maps with Siri.
[00:54:12.960 --> 00:54:15.120]   And even bigger is music.
[00:54:15.120 --> 00:54:16.560]   So audio.
[00:54:16.560 --> 00:54:21.200]   So overcast, audible, Spotify, if they bother to put it in,
[00:54:21.200 --> 00:54:23.600]   you'll be able to use Siri to control all of that.
[00:54:23.600 --> 00:54:27.440]   And they did it really smart because one of the biggest problems was catalogs.
[00:54:27.440 --> 00:54:30.320]   Apple brute force, the entire Apple music catalog.
[00:54:30.320 --> 00:54:32.800]   And they're still doing that with all the metadata, everything.
[00:54:32.800 --> 00:54:34.320]   And it's laborious.
[00:54:34.320 --> 00:54:37.680]   And developers may or may not do that, but what they're going to do is
[00:54:37.680 --> 00:54:42.240]   pre-cache any frequent or recent items that you've been playing and suck those in
[00:54:42.240 --> 00:54:44.240]   so that those are ready for you right away.
[00:54:44.240 --> 00:54:47.120]   And then if it has to do more complicated lookups, it'll do those later.
[00:54:47.120 --> 00:54:50.880]   Oh, there's so much to talk about.
[00:54:50.880 --> 00:54:51.600]   I know.
[00:54:51.600 --> 00:54:54.800]   Mardset Pan is no longer a delicious almond treat.
[00:54:54.800 --> 00:54:57.680]   It's Catalyst, Project Catalyst.
[00:54:57.680 --> 00:55:01.280]   But some of the same features, that's going to be, I think,
[00:55:01.280 --> 00:55:02.160]   those seed changes.
[00:55:02.160 --> 00:55:06.640]   Well, it makes developers, by the way, with no extra effort, it seems like,
[00:55:06.640 --> 00:55:09.600]   be able to make their iOS apps into Mac OS apps.
[00:55:09.600 --> 00:55:10.160]   Yes, Laurie?
[00:55:10.160 --> 00:55:13.280]   Yeah, talking to developers at WFDC,
[00:55:13.280 --> 00:55:17.760]   that was one of the biggest exciting things that was coming from them was
[00:55:17.760 --> 00:55:22.560]   how easy it's going to be for them to port their iPad apps to Mac without having to do
[00:55:22.560 --> 00:55:22.880]   anything.
[00:55:22.880 --> 00:55:27.040]   Just flip a switch, maybe do a little bit of tweaking so that it makes sense on Mac,
[00:55:27.040 --> 00:55:27.600]   but that's it.
[00:55:27.600 --> 00:55:31.360]   Apple did the work so that developers don't have to.
[00:55:31.360 --> 00:55:34.640]   It sounds really great from the developer's side.
[00:55:34.640 --> 00:55:38.000]   From a user's side, of course, it's really great because we're going to have our favorite apps
[00:55:38.000 --> 00:55:42.560]   on Mac, but from the developer's point of view, they can finally have Mac apps
[00:55:42.560 --> 00:55:47.200]   and they don't have to spend a lot of time starting from scratch, building a new app.
[00:55:47.200 --> 00:55:48.080]   It's just right there.
[00:55:48.080 --> 00:55:48.960]   Just tick a box.
[00:55:48.960 --> 00:55:50.320]   Really huge.
[00:55:50.320 --> 00:55:54.720]   You could tick a box for all the different Mac platforms.
[00:55:54.720 --> 00:55:56.160]   iPhone, iPad, and Mac.
[00:55:56.160 --> 00:55:59.200]   And the one thing that was nice, I really like to hear is that Craig totally
[00:55:59.200 --> 00:56:03.040]   Mia Kulpat on last year's Catalyst Marzypine apps.
[00:56:03.040 --> 00:56:05.920]   He's like, "Those weren't an example of technology.
[00:56:05.920 --> 00:56:09.680]   We let everyone make their own design choices because we were experimenting with it."
[00:56:09.680 --> 00:56:11.440]   And some of them worked out worse than others.
[00:56:11.440 --> 00:56:15.520]   But when you look at podcasts and you put it next to podcasts as a Catalyst app,
[00:56:15.520 --> 00:56:20.160]   music is an AppKit app and you put them next to each other and they're pretty much indistinguishable.
[00:56:20.160 --> 00:56:21.360]   You can't tell them apart.
[00:56:21.360 --> 00:56:25.600]   And I think that shows there was some fear that it would be a bunch of really crappy iPad apps
[00:56:25.600 --> 00:56:26.720]   grafted on the Mac.
[00:56:26.720 --> 00:56:29.440]   But my thinking is there's a bunch of developers who really love.
[00:56:29.440 --> 00:56:33.120]   They're proud of their apps and they just didn't have the bandwidth or the resources
[00:56:33.120 --> 00:56:34.800]   or the time to learn AppKit.
[00:56:34.800 --> 00:56:39.440]   And so they didn't make a Mac app, but now that they can have Xcode give them a Mac app
[00:56:39.440 --> 00:56:43.200]   and they can spend their time polishing it, like choosing vibrancy for the sidebar
[00:56:43.200 --> 00:56:47.040]   or tweaking the menu or the command keys, they're happy to do all that.
[00:56:47.040 --> 00:56:49.520]   They just didn't have to learn AppKit to do it.
[00:56:49.520 --> 00:56:51.680]   And we'll see all of those apps come over.
[00:56:51.680 --> 00:56:52.640]   Oh, it's amazing.
[00:56:52.640 --> 00:56:57.840]   And also maybe when Apple decides to make a touchscreen Mac,
[00:56:57.840 --> 00:57:00.640]   it means that they won't have to reinvent everything.
[00:57:00.640 --> 00:57:03.920]   Maybe we didn't even make Sidecar touchscreen.
[00:57:05.760 --> 00:57:12.880]   Well, they didn't make Sidecar touchscreen, but you can use your Apple Pencil on your iPad
[00:57:12.880 --> 00:57:14.800]   with your Mac apps.
[00:57:14.800 --> 00:57:16.400]   And that's pretty impressive.
[00:57:16.400 --> 00:57:23.600]   When I refer people back to the fact that I've been talking about when the touch bar came out
[00:57:23.600 --> 00:57:27.680]   and said, "Well, what if I have an iPhone? I have an iPad? Why don't you let developers
[00:57:27.680 --> 00:57:31.840]   put part of the user interface on this expensive, really wonderful device that I already have?"
[00:57:31.840 --> 00:57:34.240]   I'm not bragging that, "Wow, I foresaw this.
[00:57:34.240 --> 00:57:39.680]   I'm making a point about how obvious an idea this was that even a Numskull like me
[00:57:39.680 --> 00:57:42.800]   could have made this suggestion two or three years ago."
[00:57:42.800 --> 00:57:45.040]   That's something that I'm really excited about.
[00:57:45.040 --> 00:57:47.360]   It's weird.
[00:57:47.360 --> 00:57:54.480]   One of the coolest little features of the preview app has always been the ability to sign documents,
[00:57:54.480 --> 00:57:56.960]   PDF documents within the app.
[00:57:56.960 --> 00:58:03.600]   You could either take a picture of your signature or you could do with your fingertip to a signature
[00:58:03.600 --> 00:58:08.240]   on the touchpad. Now they will even just let you do it on the phone or on the iPad.
[00:58:08.240 --> 00:58:13.520]   Just when it's time to sign something, it will light up your iPad or your iPhone and say,
[00:58:13.520 --> 00:58:15.360]   "Okay, here's a signature area for it."
[00:58:15.360 --> 00:58:24.400]   It's nice to know that the boys and girls on the iPad side and the boys and girls who live on the
[00:58:24.400 --> 00:58:26.480]   Mac OS side, they're talking again.
[00:58:26.480 --> 00:58:33.120]   It's like they've been having Friday night dances and they're finally learning that,
[00:58:33.120 --> 00:58:36.080]   "Wow, these people are not freaks. We like them. Let's work together."
[00:58:36.080 --> 00:58:40.480]   Actually, that's really good news because this goes back a little ways, but when Sal
[00:58:40.480 --> 00:58:46.560]   Saguayan departed or was forced to depart Apple, of course, the King of Automator and
[00:58:46.560 --> 00:58:59.440]   as Apple script, the general gist of it seemed to be that Apple had automation and iOS had
[00:58:59.440 --> 00:59:05.680]   automation. The automation guys said iOS either didn't care about or disrespect it.
[00:59:05.680 --> 00:59:09.200]   Whatever it was, they're now the new headquarters of automation.
[00:59:09.200 --> 00:59:16.640]   You got that feeling throughout that there was iOS and there was Mac OS and it's a battle.
[00:59:16.640 --> 00:59:21.200]   This is killed Microsoft in the '90s. It was a really bad problem at Microsoft.
[00:59:21.200 --> 00:59:27.600]   It's very gratifying to see this synergy. Maybe it means one team one. Maybe it means they
[00:59:27.600 --> 00:59:32.960]   buried the hatchet, but for whatever reason you want Apple to be operating as a single unified
[00:59:32.960 --> 00:59:39.440]   home, not as different little fiefdoms. Lock-in is not a problem so long as it's a feature for the
[00:59:39.440 --> 00:59:45.120]   user and this is helping Lock-in to be a feature for the user to add more value to your iPad and
[00:59:45.120 --> 00:59:51.680]   your iPhone and your Mac. While we do talk, today, anyway, we've been talking about the creators,
[00:59:51.680 --> 00:59:57.120]   the content creators, the developers, features for them, all of this benefits the end user in the
[00:59:57.120 --> 01:00:03.120]   long run. Happy developers mean happy end users, more apps, more choice, better apps.
[01:00:03.120 --> 01:00:10.720]   I think SwiftUI is going to be a very interesting feature. This is a way the Xcode's always had a
[01:00:10.720 --> 01:00:16.960]   interface designer that you could then hook up code into, but this makes it much easier to do
[01:00:16.960 --> 01:00:21.760]   it and to do it in Swift, a modern language. It's so easy that I think you're going to see
[01:00:21.760 --> 01:00:27.680]   a lot of new people and especially young people developing for Mac OS. That's really interesting.
[01:00:27.680 --> 01:00:32.080]   Oh, I don't know if this would make a difference, though, but the the Siri shortcuts team has been
[01:00:32.080 --> 01:00:35.840]   like all of that stuff has been moved under John Jean-Andrea. So that's all part of the new AI
[01:00:35.840 --> 01:00:40.400]   division and like the Mac automation gets it's so much serious.
[01:00:40.400 --> 01:00:47.520]   Yeah, so the Mac automation, that's still going to be Mac automation. They're going to get to do
[01:00:47.520 --> 01:00:52.560]   all the scripting and all the other stuff that really doesn't make sense in an iOS-y sort of,
[01:00:52.560 --> 01:00:57.760]   or at least the current iOS-y world. And the shortcut team is really working with Siri to sort
[01:00:57.760 --> 01:01:02.240]   of, I think one day this will be the way you make Siri apps, like with voice control and with
[01:01:02.240 --> 01:01:06.320]   Siri shortcuts. And you'll just tell the system what you want to be an app and it'll go boom,
[01:01:06.320 --> 01:01:10.000]   there's your new app, but it's going to take a while to get there and them all working together
[01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:16.480]   is a good way to do that. Yeah, Siri, it's going to be one of I think it's a positive form of
[01:01:17.040 --> 01:01:23.280]   divisiveness, where it's a real bummer for everybody who has been working on apps for years and years
[01:01:23.280 --> 01:01:28.720]   and years and years and they know what they're doing. They know how UIKit works. They know how
[01:01:28.720 --> 01:01:33.920]   they're comfortable in Objective-C, they're compulsive in what they're doing. Whereas the
[01:01:33.920 --> 01:01:39.440]   people who are starting right now who like Renee say might be inspired to go from users to creators
[01:01:39.440 --> 01:01:46.240]   of apps, they are getting some of the most powerful and really kind of mind-expanding tools
[01:01:46.240 --> 01:01:52.480]   for writing apps for multiple platforms. So that's, so I kind of, it's, I don't like the fact that
[01:01:52.480 --> 01:01:56.480]   older developers are feeling kind of minus that they're going to have to basically start not
[01:01:56.480 --> 01:02:00.240]   completely anew, but they're going to have to spend a lot of their time and mental bandwidth
[01:02:00.240 --> 01:02:04.000]   learning this new system if they want to get the full benefits of writing apps for any of these
[01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:09.120]   platforms. But I'm glad to see that it will help all users everywhere. I'm also the more that I
[01:02:09.120 --> 01:02:16.000]   look into Swift UI, the more I'm wondering if part of the part of the plan for Swift UI and
[01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:22.560]   why it's so important at Apple is that let's say that you wanted to, let's say that you wanted to
[01:02:22.560 --> 01:02:28.960]   once again for the third time in Apple history, switch to a whole other processor architecture
[01:02:28.960 --> 01:02:34.720]   for the Mac. You would kind of want to, and if you could, and you didn't want to do like an emulation
[01:02:34.720 --> 01:02:41.360]   layer like you did the previous couple of times to help people along, maybe you would try to,
[01:02:41.360 --> 01:02:45.840]   in addition to all the other reasons why you would might want to get a new like sort of UIKit,
[01:02:45.840 --> 01:02:54.240]   you could basically teach all of these programmers and developers to create a brand new category of
[01:02:54.240 --> 01:03:00.080]   apps that in two or three years time when an ARM based Mac comes on the market will just automatically
[01:03:00.080 --> 01:03:05.120]   work on ARM because all they have to do is recompile these things because they're working on brand new
[01:03:05.120 --> 01:03:09.840]   APIs and because you have new versions of the operating system, they're going to require use of
[01:03:09.840 --> 01:03:16.560]   Swift UI and use of new toolkits. I think this is much more, this is a much, much bigger and broader
[01:03:16.560 --> 01:03:23.040]   plan than simply modernizing Mac app UI development. So I don't know if there's a plan, but there's
[01:03:23.040 --> 01:03:27.280]   like, there's a thing that happens at Apple where a bunch of a confluence of smart technologies
[01:03:27.280 --> 01:03:32.480]   comes together and looks like a master plan sometime. And like for Swift UI, Josh was running
[01:03:32.480 --> 01:03:37.360]   the watch team and they needed to make native apps, but UIKit was still problematic. So he started
[01:03:37.360 --> 01:03:42.320]   making Swift UI as a way for developers to make native watch apps. And then Craig saw it and said,
[01:03:42.320 --> 01:03:47.760]   no, no, we want this everywhere. Like everyone should be able to make apps like this. And so when
[01:03:47.760 --> 01:03:51.680]   Josh moved back to UIKit, he took it with them and they started just putting it together. And the
[01:03:51.680 --> 01:03:55.760]   idea is that you can write this stuff and it doesn't really matter what's underneath it. Like,
[01:03:55.760 --> 01:04:00.400]   it'll do your app kit when it has to or do UI kit when it has to, it'll do whatever anything else
[01:04:00.400 --> 01:04:05.120]   coming in the future will do. And even something like dark mode, they didn't just make a dark mode,
[01:04:05.120 --> 01:04:10.480]   they created semantic dynamic colors. So for example, instead of like this being RGB,
[01:04:10.480 --> 01:04:17.600]   0, 0, 0, and this being RGB, 255, 255, 255, it's background color and it's background color and
[01:04:17.600 --> 01:04:23.360]   it's UI blue and it's label and all of those stuff can move around. So that, again, it's like
[01:04:23.360 --> 01:04:27.600]   another abstraction layer developers can tell it what they want to do and the system can figure
[01:04:27.600 --> 01:04:31.760]   out the optimal way to do it. And to Andy's point as those systems start to change, the
[01:04:31.760 --> 01:04:36.400]   developer no longer has to go back and change all the hardwired code because the code is
[01:04:36.400 --> 01:04:40.720]   aware enough to know what its new capabilities are, which is really, really cool when you think
[01:04:40.720 --> 01:04:43.760]   about a future, a future forwards operating system.
[01:04:43.760 --> 01:04:53.680]   Yeah. It's the Swift UI track from WWDC is up. You can watch the video and if you're a developer
[01:04:53.680 --> 01:05:00.400]   to watch this code come alive in the emulator immediately to the right and to see how fast and
[01:05:00.400 --> 01:05:06.880]   easy it is to do this and Swift, how powerful it is, is really exciting. And I feel like this is
[01:05:06.880 --> 01:05:12.880]   this is going to be a and again, legible. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's a great opportunity for
[01:05:12.880 --> 01:05:18.400]   developers, but that means great software for end users. And a bunch of the next guys were like
[01:05:18.400 --> 01:05:21.600]   super, I didn't think they'd be excited about it because there was some pushback on Swift,
[01:05:21.600 --> 01:05:25.200]   but the Swift UI stuff, they're like, you know, I've been, this is something we tried to do it
[01:05:25.200 --> 01:05:29.760]   next. We were never able to do it. And I'm so happy. And a group had a good point too. It's like
[01:05:29.760 --> 01:05:34.000]   when they just typed in the word blue, the whole front of the room was like, yeah, it turned blue
[01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:41.040]   because you type blue and the whole back of the room just exploded. Yeah. I mean, it's a live
[01:05:41.040 --> 01:05:48.960]   preview and you can watch the code execute on a running program as it's running. This is kind of
[01:05:48.960 --> 01:05:54.880]   the bottom of that works with you. I know anything of for someone like me that doesn't know anything
[01:05:54.880 --> 01:05:59.600]   about developing like I've never learned code or anything. And I look at that and it seems
[01:05:59.600 --> 01:06:05.120]   it makes sense. It doesn't look like a different language to me. It looks like a language that I
[01:06:05.120 --> 01:06:10.560]   could learn, not something that I'm so intimidated by. So it's even exciting for people like me
[01:06:10.560 --> 01:06:14.960]   who's never really been interested in coding before it kind of makes me want to go, you know,
[01:06:14.960 --> 01:06:23.440]   learn some coding. Good. That's the idea. Yeah. I mean, I kind of like, I went from like C++
[01:06:24.160 --> 01:06:30.640]   to AppleScript, really, because by the time I never really got into C++ as a creative
[01:06:30.640 --> 01:06:35.200]   endeavor, it was always very, very technical. Whereas I was even 65 to a similar language,
[01:06:35.200 --> 01:06:39.760]   I thought was a very, very creative way of creating programs. And I didn't really get
[01:06:39.760 --> 01:06:45.680]   renew my love for creating software until I got into AppleScript, until I got back into Python.
[01:06:45.680 --> 01:06:53.040]   Swift is kind of getting into my heart a little bit because it is sort of, oh, God, do I really have to
[01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:57.520]   do I really have you're not going to go you're not going to let me access memory directly,
[01:06:57.520 --> 01:07:01.440]   but you're going to annoy the heck out of me. Every time I tell you every time I dereference a
[01:07:01.440 --> 01:07:05.280]   pointer incorrectly, by a way that you've decided to make up on your own right now,
[01:07:05.280 --> 01:07:10.080]   you're not making this fun for me compiler. So yeah, this is getting me back into programming.
[01:07:10.080 --> 01:07:17.280]   If I want no pointers, I should get no pointers. So there it works. Just let it run. It's work.
[01:07:17.280 --> 01:07:23.520]   Where's my garbage collection? Where's my Java? I'm sorry, but I believe that you want to
[01:07:23.520 --> 01:07:28.880]   be a long end instead of your. So for that reason, I'm going to have to like flag this for a
[01:07:28.880 --> 01:07:36.160]   shot. It's a tip calculator. By the way, was it as noisy in the room when they mentioned the tip
[01:07:36.160 --> 01:07:41.040]   calculator on the watch as it was at home? You couldn't even hear what anybody was saying.
[01:07:41.040 --> 01:07:46.560]   It's like that was the highlight of the keynote, that dark mode. And there was a couple of other
[01:07:46.560 --> 01:07:50.080]   people just lost their money. Also, there was apprehension when you saw that first hint of the
[01:07:50.080 --> 01:08:18.240]   Mac Pro and it looked round. Everyone just gat
[01:08:18.240 --> 01:08:22.960]   it. They understand that they need to start again. Here's the just in case you didn't see it.
[01:08:22.960 --> 01:08:30.960]   Here's the 45 second intro video. Right? Yeah. Yeah. That's how I think that's how they
[01:08:30.960 --> 01:08:35.040]   entered setting. I think that's how they introduced the the trash can Mac was that very
[01:08:35.040 --> 01:08:43.360]   I'm looking at this going Oh crap. It's round. Oh no, it looks just like the trash can Mac.
[01:08:43.360 --> 01:08:48.080]   Oh, they're showing us the wheels. They're showing us the holes. I think those are the holes, but
[01:08:48.080 --> 01:08:52.720]   but then that mean that's the trash can. Wait a minute. Maybe it is the trash can.
[01:08:52.720 --> 01:08:58.080]   I think Lori's right. I think that might be the wheel. It says the 2019 Mac Pro concept
[01:08:58.080 --> 01:09:03.600]   idea. Oh, this is somebody else. Oh, I said the wrong one. God, no wonder it looks so much like that.
[01:09:03.600 --> 01:09:10.400]   That's I will I will show it again. Maybe it's this one. No, that's 20.
[01:09:10.400 --> 01:09:16.320]   So that horizon at the beginning. Yeah, they did. Yeah, they did. So that proves it because that
[01:09:16.320 --> 01:09:22.000]   was made out of the trash can Mac intro. So let me see if I can find.
[01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:32.240]   It was yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Anyway, if you watch it, you'll go, I've seen that before. Oh no.
[01:09:32.240 --> 01:09:37.120]   Then they never showed the Johnny I've this is the Johnny I've won. They never showed the Johnny
[01:09:37.120 --> 01:09:44.400]   I've won, which kind of surprised me. I had Johnny I've video on my bingo card. So I was a little disappointed.
[01:09:44.400 --> 01:09:49.360]   Anyway, it's just and Phil and Dan were all in the hands on area because a lot of people were
[01:09:49.360 --> 01:09:55.120]   concerned they didn't see them, but they were all in the area. Okay, good. What let's talk about
[01:09:55.120 --> 01:10:01.360]   let's take a break and then talk about iPad OS because I think that that also is a really good
[01:10:01.360 --> 01:10:10.080]   example of Apple listening to me. But because how many times have people said, oh, this new iPad
[01:10:10.080 --> 01:10:17.840]   Pro is the best hardware ever running ancient antiquated software. Well, now it has its very own
[01:10:17.840 --> 01:10:23.920]   version of iOS. But first a word from our sponsor, the folks at last pass. Actually, the number one
[01:10:23.920 --> 01:10:30.000]   app I put on my iOS devices or my Android devices or my Mac devices or my window devices. In fact,
[01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:34.560]   when I set up a new device, pretty much the first thing I installed as last pass, last pass
[01:10:34.560 --> 01:10:40.400]   is a password manager, a vault where you can store all your passwords and not have to remember
[01:10:40.400 --> 01:10:45.280]   them. If you're tired of setting, remembering and forgetting passwords, let last pass take away all
[01:10:45.280 --> 01:10:52.640]   the stress with password management, just one password, your master password. And last pass
[01:10:52.640 --> 01:10:58.240]   will generate and remember the rest. And you do want to let last pass generate long, strong passwords.
[01:10:58.240 --> 01:11:04.800]   In fact, last pass has a security assay that I went through the other day after flipboard got
[01:11:04.800 --> 01:11:10.080]   compromised, I thought, Oh, I'm in trouble. Because I use that flipboard password everywhere. So all
[01:11:10.080 --> 01:11:16.080]   I did is I go into last pass, I run the security check, it comes up with passwords that I've used
[01:11:16.080 --> 01:11:20.800]   multiple times passwords that are weak passwords I haven't changed in a while. And in most cases
[01:11:20.800 --> 01:11:25.680]   will automatically change those passwords in seconds for me. And the ones that I have to do by hand,
[01:11:25.680 --> 01:11:30.800]   it'll walk you through the process. It makes it easy to create a unique, strong password for
[01:11:30.800 --> 01:11:36.880]   every account. And since there are so many breaches these days, that is a worthwhile effort, a worthwhile
[01:11:36.880 --> 01:11:43.440]   endeavor. And then once your passwords are in last pass, it auto fills it. So even on iOS and
[01:11:43.440 --> 01:11:49.680]   Android, so when you install an app, if I put snapchat on my new iPhone, I have to just press a button
[01:11:49.680 --> 01:11:57.120]   and last pass fills it in logs me in and I'm set. Last pass is more secure, safer. Frankly, it's the
[01:11:57.120 --> 01:12:06.320]   only way to manage passwords. I mean, if you're not using last pass, run, don't walk to lastpass.com/twit.
[01:12:06.320 --> 01:12:11.120]   Last pass.com/twit. There's a last pass for everybody, last pass premium for individuals.
[01:12:11.120 --> 01:12:16.640]   At home, we use last pass families, because I have a shared folder that everybody in the family,
[01:12:16.640 --> 01:12:22.240]   well, Lisa gets. And that way, she can, you know, if I set up a new account with a cable provider or
[01:12:22.240 --> 01:12:27.360]   the utility company, she gets that password automatically. If I change it, it changes automatically.
[01:12:27.360 --> 01:12:34.080]   She also has emergency access to my last pass fall. This is a very nice feature. You absolutely
[01:12:34.080 --> 01:12:38.320]   should set up to designate somebody should something happen to you if you die or become disabled,
[01:12:38.320 --> 01:12:42.400]   so that they have your passwords so that they can settle your estate so they can
[01:12:42.960 --> 01:12:49.600]   close your Facebook account. All of that stuff. I highly recommend last pass for that reason alone.
[01:12:49.600 --> 01:12:54.320]   Then there's also last pass teams for small businesses, 50 or fewer, and last pass enterprise.
[01:12:54.320 --> 01:12:59.600]   That's what we've been using at Twit for many years now. 100 plus customizable policies in the
[01:12:59.600 --> 01:13:04.400]   enterprise version to give you flexibility and control when it comes to managing access in your
[01:13:04.400 --> 01:13:11.120]   organization. For instance, we have us, we have minimum requirements for the master password,
[01:13:11.120 --> 01:13:15.920]   minimum length, number of digits, and so forth. We also require two factor in last pass supports
[01:13:15.920 --> 01:13:22.800]   every form of two factor. I use a Yuba key, but it also supports Duo. And of course,
[01:13:22.800 --> 01:13:29.040]   all the various authenticator programs. It is really a nice thing to do. We require two factor
[01:13:29.040 --> 01:13:34.400]   here at Twit. But we also give every one of our employees their own copy of last pass because I
[01:13:34.400 --> 01:13:38.960]   think that that's a benefit everybody should have. We benefit and they benefit. And as an admin,
[01:13:38.960 --> 01:13:43.760]   you get all sorts of great reports. You can track changes over time. You can improve security,
[01:13:43.760 --> 01:13:49.440]   check trends, and revoke passwords or reset passwords. I get the email because I'm one of
[01:13:49.440 --> 01:13:54.480]   the administrators. I always know one of you guys forgets your passwords. It never happens to you,
[01:13:54.480 --> 01:14:00.640]   John. Good job. With seamless background sync, offline access, and an app for almost every device,
[01:14:00.640 --> 01:14:07.520]   you always have your passwords. And only you have your passwords because last pass only decrypts
[01:14:07.520 --> 01:14:12.640]   at device level. They don't have access. You don't have access. I mean, you do. They don't.
[01:14:12.640 --> 01:14:17.840]   You have access. They don't. And the hackers don't. Join over 13 and a half million people
[01:14:17.840 --> 01:14:21.680]   have signed up and trusted. I've been using it for a decade. We've been using it Twit for several
[01:14:21.680 --> 01:14:26.480]   years. I even ran it by Steve Gibson. He interviewed the creator of last pass, Joe Seagris.
[01:14:26.480 --> 01:14:31.520]   Jokes showed him everything it's doing. All the things it's doing smart and well. And that's
[01:14:31.520 --> 01:14:37.600]   what Steve uses. That's a pretty good recommendation. LastPass.com/Twit. Thank you,
[01:14:37.600 --> 01:14:42.960]   LastPass, for your support of Twit all these years. And we thank you for supporting Mac
[01:14:42.960 --> 01:14:46.960]   Break Weekly by using that special address, LastPass.com/Twit.
[01:14:46.960 --> 01:14:52.160]   I tell you a cool new password feature for iOS 13 that would work well with this, Leo.
[01:14:52.160 --> 01:14:55.920]   What? So you know a sign on with Apple, the new single sign on there doing?
[01:14:55.920 --> 01:15:00.400]   Yes. So they're making it so that it can shoot you fast. Like let's say you download a new game,
[01:15:00.400 --> 01:15:03.600]   you just want to get in and play, a developer doesn't care about your stuff. You just hit that
[01:15:03.600 --> 01:15:06.960]   button that creates your account and you're in. But sometimes people forget that they already
[01:15:06.960 --> 01:15:10.960]   have an account. So in that case, Apple is going to check with the database and they have both the
[01:15:10.960 --> 01:15:15.360]   keychain and they have the extension for password managers. And it will show you that you already
[01:15:15.360 --> 01:15:20.240]   have an account. Oh, hello, you want in? Yeah. You know, create multiple accounts by accident.
[01:15:20.240 --> 01:15:25.200]   I do that all the time. Yeah. In fact, well, this time, you could take the LastPass
[01:15:25.200 --> 01:15:31.760]   Lortner then. This time, I was my own fault. I set up if this is that years ago and I turned on two
[01:15:31.760 --> 01:15:39.040]   factor. But then for some reason, I erased the two factor from my authenticator. I don't know why.
[01:15:39.040 --> 01:15:45.520]   So now I have a rogue, if this is the net account that is doing stuff on my behalf,
[01:15:45.520 --> 01:15:52.240]   then I can't stop it. So careful folks, do not going to get multiple accounts.
[01:15:53.120 --> 01:15:58.320]   This will try to save you from yourself. Holy cow. I don't. So for instance,
[01:15:58.320 --> 01:16:04.160]   and this was a weird experience, I have why things, blood pressure monitor and scale.
[01:16:04.160 --> 01:16:14.640]   And I hadn't, I had in 10 years ago, I created a Twitter account called Leo's scale. And I had
[01:16:14.640 --> 01:16:19.200]   set it up with this and that that would tweet my weight in my blood pressure. Hadn't done that
[01:16:19.200 --> 01:16:25.600]   since 2015. All of a sudden, I got a new scale, a new blood pressure monitor, and I tied it into my
[01:16:25.600 --> 01:16:33.280]   why things account and all of a sudden it's tweeting again. And I can't stop it.
[01:16:33.280 --> 01:16:38.320]   God, the robots are taking over. If this then that says you have to call us. If you have an account,
[01:16:38.320 --> 01:16:43.600]   you want to decommission and you can't log into it. So I now have to call if this then that.
[01:16:43.600 --> 01:16:48.320]   So can you please turn that off? I don't know what else it's doing. It's doing other things too.
[01:16:48.320 --> 01:16:51.200]   It's like a little bot. It's got out of my control.
[01:16:51.200 --> 01:16:56.480]   Yeah. It's just living. It's its own living entity.
[01:16:56.480 --> 01:17:02.480]   Get to it. It's a very interesting experience. You can actually, without this and that,
[01:17:02.480 --> 01:17:05.840]   create a creature that responds to in stimulus and then lose control of it.
[01:17:05.840 --> 01:17:15.360]   That's creepy. I know. Well, imagine my surprise when I was, I came into work and Kim Shaffer says,
[01:17:16.080 --> 01:17:21.120]   oh, nice, nice blood pressure. What? How did you know? Well, you tweeted it.
[01:17:21.120 --> 01:17:32.560]   Oh, no, I did not. So back to iPad OS. iPad OS coming in iOS 13. Is that the right way to say it?
[01:17:32.560 --> 01:17:38.240]   Or should we say a brand new OS coming in the fall? Depends on how you want to market it.
[01:17:39.440 --> 01:17:48.880]   It's iOS, right? It's based on iOS 13, but it is given its own destination because what Apple did
[01:17:48.880 --> 01:17:57.440]   with this software is bigger than just adding a few features. So to call it iOS 13 with iPad
[01:17:57.440 --> 01:18:04.160]   features is really doing the software update and disservice because it really is a major change
[01:18:04.160 --> 01:18:12.320]   from just iOS 13. And I think that the, from marketing purposes, it's iOS, but it really is,
[01:18:12.320 --> 01:18:19.200]   like there's so many things that you get to do on an iPad that are significant and wonderful and
[01:18:19.200 --> 01:18:24.880]   amazing that if you would have just called it iOS 13 with a couple new features, you wouldn't
[01:18:24.880 --> 01:18:30.800]   have realized just how amazing it is. Well, and I think I'm going to even read more into it.
[01:18:31.440 --> 01:18:35.920]   I think it is the beginning of the differentiation of the iPad from the iPhone.
[01:18:35.920 --> 01:18:42.080]   Absolutely. It's a promise that every year they have to show up and announce new features
[01:18:42.080 --> 01:18:46.400]   just like they have to with watch. You can't just go, "Oh, sorry, Tim has a slide saying iPad,
[01:18:46.400 --> 01:18:49.200]   you asked, well, you have nothing. I thought it was. We have nothing to say this year." They
[01:18:49.200 --> 01:18:54.880]   should have done this. Well, I shouldn't say that because I, but I'm glad they did it because it
[01:18:54.880 --> 01:19:00.240]   does. It makes this a distinct, this iPad, a distinct creature that does because it really does
[01:19:00.240 --> 01:19:06.480]   deserve. For instance, the home screen, for having the iPhone home screen on there,
[01:19:06.480 --> 01:19:14.000]   left all this real estate, these big spaced out icons, it's very OCD of me, but I found that
[01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:19.600]   extremely annoying. Well, there's a lot of little stuff that just the fact that we can get now that
[01:19:19.600 --> 01:19:26.880]   an iPad will have its own version of Safari that is treated not as a mobile browser,
[01:19:26.880 --> 01:19:35.040]   but as like a desktop browser. Not only are they marketing the iPad as a true productivity-based
[01:19:35.040 --> 01:19:40.320]   alternative to a laptop, or at least, excuse me, not something that can do the same work as a
[01:19:40.320 --> 01:19:46.160]   laptop, but the same thing, the same jobs as a laptop only better. They're doing this for real.
[01:19:46.160 --> 01:19:50.080]   They're really putting their money where their mouth is, but just simply saying there is iPad
[01:19:50.080 --> 01:19:56.240]   OS and then there is iOS and really sells the idea to people who are considering that, gives them
[01:19:56.240 --> 01:20:02.000]   that extra little psychological push that says, "Oh, this is not just the same operating system
[01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:07.920]   that's running on my phone." I wonder how long iOS will remain iOS instead of iPhone OS though?
[01:20:07.920 --> 01:20:12.560]   It used to be iPhone OS, right, until iOS 4. Oh, Ironic forgot about that.
[01:20:12.560 --> 01:20:17.360]   We're going to be able to put some widgets on the home screen. I think that will be a big improvement
[01:20:17.360 --> 01:20:22.480]   coming from Android. That's one of the features I most learned about Android.
[01:20:22.480 --> 01:20:27.360]   Right after HTC announces that almost nobody uses widgets, Apple deploys them. HTC announces
[01:20:27.360 --> 01:20:32.640]   that no one uses widgets. Apple kills Dashboard and then adds widgets to the iPad home screen.
[01:20:32.640 --> 01:20:38.320]   Yeah, no more Dashboard. What? That's wild. Yeah. Finally. They went to the iPad home screen.
[01:20:38.320 --> 01:20:43.680]   I'm a little concerned about the gestures because one of the things that killed Windows 8 was a
[01:20:43.680 --> 01:20:50.160]   lot of undiscoverable affordances, weird places to move the mouse and gestures that nobody reads
[01:20:50.160 --> 01:20:54.640]   the manual, nobody could figure out, nobody could remember. iOS is starting to get a lot of these.
[01:20:54.640 --> 01:21:00.640]   Now these new gestures for cut and copy and undo three finger gestures.
[01:21:00.640 --> 01:21:06.640]   I guess what are you going to do with something like iOS? There's a greater philosophy. I got a
[01:21:06.640 --> 01:21:12.880]   chance to talk to Sarah Herlinger who runs Accessibility at Apple. What they wanted to do was abstract
[01:21:12.880 --> 01:21:18.480]   away the controlling mechanism from the iPad. For example, their philosophy was, "You should be
[01:21:18.480 --> 01:21:22.960]   able to do everything with multi-touch, everything with the keyboard, and everything with a mouse or
[01:21:22.960 --> 01:21:27.280]   a system of how much you do." How windowsy of them. That's so funny because in the early days of
[01:21:27.280 --> 01:21:31.600]   the Mac and Touch, they very clearly said, "No, you have to use the mouse. You cannot use a keyboard
[01:21:31.600 --> 01:21:35.680]   to do this." I mean, it's 10 years later. It's like, honestly, it should have been five years later
[01:21:35.680 --> 01:21:39.120]   that they started doing that because we learned multi-touch by then. But these gestures,
[01:21:39.120 --> 01:21:44.400]   basically anything you can drag, you can drop into a new window. The three finger thing is going
[01:21:44.400 --> 01:21:48.080]   to be problematic. For example, for people who just can't control three fingers on the same hand,
[01:21:48.400 --> 01:21:54.080]   but they have a few problematic for the guy doing the demo on stage. He keeps saying, "Whoops,
[01:21:54.080 --> 01:21:59.520]   no. Sorry." My biggest problem now is you still can't tell what window you're in unless I'm
[01:21:59.520 --> 01:22:02.880]   mistaken, but you still can't tell what window you're in. So I'm lapping and pasting in the wrong
[01:22:02.880 --> 01:22:07.040]   window sometimes because there's no active. It doesn't change the color of the window.
[01:22:07.040 --> 01:22:10.720]   Yeah, that's a good point. Yeah. Yeah, that's true. I have that problem all the time because-
[01:22:10.720 --> 01:22:17.200]   Remember, this is dev beta one. So make sure that we are clarifying that this isn't the permanent
[01:22:17.200 --> 01:22:20.320]   way it's going to be. Maybe they'll make some changes by the time it comes out.
[01:22:20.320 --> 01:22:24.640]   Well, and they did reassure me by adding a huge number of keyboard commands.
[01:22:24.640 --> 01:22:27.360]   Yeah. So you're supposed to be able to control it with your keyboard, too.
[01:22:27.360 --> 01:22:30.400]   I don't have to take my fingers off the keyboard. And I think actually,
[01:22:30.400 --> 01:22:34.720]   I love a touch screen, but I don't want to have to take my fingers off the keyboard.
[01:22:34.720 --> 01:22:37.280]   And switching modes like that is problematic.
[01:22:37.280 --> 01:22:42.960]   Yeah, we had that discussion about once your iPad is connected to a keyboard,
[01:22:42.960 --> 01:22:48.480]   your brain says, I don't want to touch the screen anymore, but you still end up having to touch the
[01:22:48.480 --> 01:22:55.680]   screen. And the way iPad OS is coming around and even with the accessibility pointing devices,
[01:22:55.680 --> 01:23:01.280]   which allows you to have a mouse or a trackpad connected, I don't want to call it mouse support
[01:23:01.280 --> 01:23:06.800]   or trackpad support. I haven't actually tried yet to see how robust the mouse support is, but it's
[01:23:06.800 --> 01:23:14.000]   called pointing devices, which allow you to have a more detailed pointer. So with pointing device
[01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:20.080]   support and keyboard support and keyboard shortcuts, we are at that point now where we no longer have
[01:23:20.080 --> 01:23:27.040]   to reach up and touch the screen when we don't want to if we're using our iPad in keyboard mode.
[01:23:27.040 --> 01:23:32.640]   It really does make a huge difference on using it like you would use a computer.
[01:23:32.640 --> 01:23:36.720]   They did not mention this feature on the stage, but Renee, I know you went right to the demo
[01:23:36.720 --> 01:23:41.840]   where I'm looking and were able to find my support. So we've confirmed now that mouse support is
[01:23:41.840 --> 01:23:46.000]   trackpad support as well. I've been using it. And basically what it does is it puts a little
[01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:49.680]   crosshair on the screen and you move that crosshair around and then you press the button and it
[01:23:49.680 --> 01:23:55.680]   literally taps whatever the crosshair is on. Does it have right click support? And again,
[01:23:55.680 --> 01:24:08.240]   it developer beta one. So that's interesting. Yeah, that's why it's an accessibility and not as
[01:24:08.240 --> 01:24:14.400]   a general UI device. It's really about accessibility. There's no concept of a mouse in iOS and instead
[01:24:14.400 --> 01:24:18.080]   of grafting that on, they took a system touch which has been built in there for years and they
[01:24:18.080 --> 01:24:23.440]   expanded it to external pointing devices. And one of the things that's cool is that 3D touch and
[01:24:23.440 --> 01:24:28.320]   long press were confusing because they would often collide. You'd get it wrong and now they're just
[01:24:28.320 --> 01:24:32.880]   the same thing. So on an iPad now, you can just press and you get keyboard shortcut or you just
[01:24:32.880 --> 01:24:37.680]   say you get home screen shortcuts. You get all the stuff that you get with 3D touch which
[01:24:37.680 --> 01:24:42.160]   makes your brain just think it works that way. Yeah, that was long overdue. Having various ways
[01:24:42.160 --> 01:24:47.920]   to do the same things is always a bad idea. In that respect, how am I belong pressing? Am I
[01:24:47.920 --> 01:24:52.960]   what am I doing here? And you couldn't put 3D touch on the iPad because the screen was too big
[01:24:52.960 --> 01:24:56.320]   for the way they did it on the iPhone. I would interfere. But so now they just said, okay, but
[01:24:56.320 --> 01:25:06.160]   whatever long presses. 3D touch was a weird implementation. It goes to show how difficult it
[01:25:06.160 --> 01:25:11.200]   is to have a feature that is not a basic UI feature that they can't implement on every single
[01:25:11.200 --> 01:25:17.200]   device. So that means that it's not going to be essential, which means that people are not going,
[01:25:17.200 --> 01:25:21.840]   even people who have a device that works with 3D touch, they're not going to instinctively
[01:25:21.840 --> 01:25:26.000]   do that. Well, what happens if I thought if I 3D touch on this thing, what happens then?
[01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:30.640]   And so it's easy to forget that this feature actually exists. And I feel this and it's great
[01:25:30.640 --> 01:25:35.520]   for people who use it and people who think that way. And it doesn't get in the way of people who
[01:25:35.520 --> 01:25:40.400]   don't think that way. That's how I feel about all these like three finger gestures on iPad.
[01:25:40.400 --> 01:25:44.800]   But I feel as though that's not really a way of moving things forward. People are not going to
[01:25:44.800 --> 01:25:51.040]   think hallelujah. Now I can three not what happens if I 3D drag on this on this paragraph. I really
[01:25:51.040 --> 01:25:58.080]   do think that mouse and trackpad support is I think I hope it's not a dogmatic omission from
[01:25:58.080 --> 01:26:02.080]   iPadOS at this point. I hope it's not something where they just say no, no, no, of course, we can't.
[01:26:02.080 --> 01:26:06.960]   We wouldn't do that. Sully the iPad with something as trivial as an eye as a mouse support. We're
[01:26:06.960 --> 01:26:11.920]   going to do something much, much more bigger than what no, you should just it works great. You plug
[01:26:11.920 --> 01:26:17.680]   a mouse in on even on Android phone and it works great by just simply having a mouse pointer.
[01:26:17.680 --> 01:26:21.200]   You can click on things you would ordinarily tap on. You don't have to come up with this
[01:26:21.200 --> 01:26:26.640]   entire back story. You don't have to come up with this MCU universe idea of how this is going to
[01:26:26.640 --> 01:26:32.000]   fit in and broaden the thing. Just give us a pointer that shows up when you attach via Bluetooth or
[01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:39.200]   via USB a pointing device. And my goodness, will I be so happy with my iPad Pro? Well, you got it.
[01:26:39.200 --> 01:26:43.280]   Happens with everything now. Yeah. And it's all of iOS 13. So you can use it on your iPhone 2 if
[01:26:43.280 --> 01:26:52.000]   you want to. Yeah. Yeah. Go ahead. So one thing with 3D touch and long press,
[01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:58.640]   the issue that I have had recently, I've noticed is I will switch between devices that do and
[01:26:58.640 --> 01:27:04.560]   don't support it. And I press really hard on a screen that doesn't support it on accident.
[01:27:04.560 --> 01:27:11.760]   Looking for that 3D press. So my brain is going to be happy to navigate amongst all of my
[01:27:11.760 --> 01:27:16.320]   mobile devices and not accidentally try to trigger things that don't exist on this different device.
[01:27:16.320 --> 01:27:19.600]   Like touch ID on iPod touch. You just think it's broken and you sit there forever and it doesn't
[01:27:19.600 --> 01:27:26.320]   unlock and you remember you have to press it. Yeah. iTunes is dead. Long live iTunes.
[01:27:26.320 --> 01:27:32.960]   Not dead. It's just been split up. So yeah, that's okay. So finally, Apple has published it
[01:27:32.960 --> 01:27:42.880]   just published today at support.apple.com. Note 210200. And it's almost the kind of thing that
[01:27:42.880 --> 01:27:48.400]   your dad would come up to you and say about the upcoming changes.
[01:27:48.400 --> 01:27:54.960]   Mark Gurman put out an article last week saying that Apple was going to deprecate iTunes
[01:27:54.960 --> 01:28:00.240]   for these new apps. So Los Angeles Times proceeded to quote, to reference him and say that they were
[01:28:00.240 --> 01:28:06.160]   killing the iTunes store and eliminating downloads. And my mom called me. My friends called me.
[01:28:06.160 --> 01:28:11.360]   Everyone was in a panic that Apple was going to come to their house and take away their downloads
[01:28:11.360 --> 01:28:15.120]   and their store. So they're really just ever, ever happened. They're just splitting it up into
[01:28:15.120 --> 01:28:21.520]   three apps, music, podcasts and TV. Music. Here's Apple's a note. Music you've imported or purchased
[01:28:21.520 --> 01:28:26.560]   will be in the Apple music app, logically. Music playlists, smart playlists, you created an
[01:28:26.560 --> 01:28:32.240]   iTunes will be in the Apple music app. The iTunes store will still be available to buy music on Mac,
[01:28:32.240 --> 01:28:38.080]   iOS, PC and Apple TV. iTunes gift card, iTunes credits will be maintained and can be used with
[01:28:38.080 --> 01:28:44.880]   the new apps in the app store. iPhone, iPad, iPod, backup, restore and syncing. This is a big one.
[01:28:44.880 --> 01:28:49.120]   We'll move to finder. So it's now going to add. I love that so much. This is the exact right thing
[01:28:49.120 --> 01:28:54.400]   to do. It's now an operating system feature. It'll show up as they showed on stage in the menu bar.
[01:28:55.440 --> 01:28:59.680]   Good. So your backup makes so much sense there, Leo. It just it makes so much sense for that stuff
[01:28:59.680 --> 01:29:05.680]   to be in finder. Yes. Movies and TV shows will be in the TV app. Yeah.
[01:29:05.680 --> 01:29:13.040]   The use the Apple TV app for Mac and future for Mac for future movie and TV purchases and rentals.
[01:29:13.040 --> 01:29:20.320]   Does that mean you can't use the TV app on iOS to purchase movies? No, I'm sure you can. No,
[01:29:20.320 --> 01:29:26.960]   you still can. The big deal about this is we're quote unquote finally getting 4K HDR downloads
[01:29:26.960 --> 01:29:31.680]   and streams on the Mac because this package is all up the way Hollywood wants it packaged all up.
[01:29:31.680 --> 01:29:35.520]   Right. Podcasts you subscribe to iTunes will be in the podcast app.
[01:29:35.520 --> 01:29:39.680]   Audiobooks will be in the updated Apple books app. I think that's interesting.
[01:29:39.680 --> 01:29:45.120]   Use the Apple books app for Mac for future audiobook purchases. So in other words,
[01:29:45.120 --> 01:29:49.680]   all the functions are still there. This is something iTunes much needed. It was really
[01:29:49.680 --> 01:29:54.880]   overburdened with too many features. They're just cleaning it up by moving the various
[01:29:54.880 --> 01:29:58.880]   forms of media into their own. Didn't you love that joke though when he completely
[01:29:58.880 --> 01:30:03.280]   lent into the any app developer? Yes. Enough time will never be an email app. Yes.
[01:30:03.280 --> 01:30:10.400]   Which is absolutely true. That's that. We're adding email to iTunes. It's a great joke. Yeah.
[01:30:10.400 --> 01:30:18.240]   Failed it. Yeah, that was funny. That was a nice moment. So this is Renee,
[01:30:18.240 --> 01:30:22.640]   you've looked at this now and Renee and Lori, you've both used it now. You feel good about it?
[01:30:22.640 --> 01:30:31.600]   Is it any issues you can see? Renee? It's hard to talk about it's hard to talk about this when
[01:30:31.600 --> 01:30:36.080]   it's developer beta, right? Because you don't know what's going to happen in the end. But one
[01:30:36.080 --> 01:30:42.480]   thing that I did notice that I'm not sure how this is going to work out, but the TV app right now,
[01:30:42.480 --> 01:30:51.920]   you can't on Mac. You can't add apps to it. So you can't add your Hulu app to it.
[01:30:51.920 --> 01:30:56.720]   There's nothing to add. So how are we going to access those things?
[01:30:56.720 --> 01:31:02.720]   Oh, they'll fix that. They have to. That's why, again, this developer beta and I hate saying
[01:31:02.720 --> 01:31:08.000]   things because we've got months for them to figure this out. Presumably what will happen is that
[01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:14.880]   companies will be able to develop using Swift to be able to move their apps to Mac really easily.
[01:31:14.880 --> 01:31:19.680]   So then we'll download those apps on our Mac and then they'll just show up in the TV like they do
[01:31:19.680 --> 01:31:27.120]   on Apple TV. But at this moment, there isn't that's not there. But you'll still have a Netflix app
[01:31:27.120 --> 01:31:31.360]   and a Hulu app on Mac. So it's not like you're not going to just won't be in the TV app.
[01:31:31.360 --> 01:31:34.000]   And we hope so. Netflix, Michael, we're playing as a website.
[01:31:34.000 --> 01:31:38.720]   That might be. Sorry. Go ahead.
[01:31:38.720 --> 01:31:42.640]   It might be coming to the TV app. It's just right now because it's so early,
[01:31:42.640 --> 01:31:47.600]   it's really hard to tell what is how this is going to work, how this design user interface is
[01:31:47.600 --> 01:31:54.000]   going to work for us. Here's the screenshot of sinking in Finder. It looks pretty much like the
[01:31:54.000 --> 01:31:59.280]   iTunes sync page, except instead of being in iTunes, it's showing up as part of your Finder window,
[01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:05.360]   which is it's a location locations include your iPhone and you all the same thing,
[01:32:05.360 --> 01:32:10.480]   you can manage storage, you'll see all the different media types. This is actually
[01:32:10.480 --> 01:32:16.240]   much cleaner interface. You can back up, you can encrypt all the things you could do before.
[01:32:16.240 --> 01:32:22.000]   This is this makes a lot of sense. Every time how many of us have had to go through that
[01:32:22.000 --> 01:32:26.080]   people who have their own their first iPhone or their first iPad, they're just they're just
[01:32:26.080 --> 01:32:30.880]   expecting they plug it into the USB port. They're expecting to see it in the Finder somewhere.
[01:32:30.880 --> 01:32:34.800]   Even if you live in the middle of the icon and then we don't know where it's like, come on.
[01:32:34.800 --> 01:32:40.800]   Yeah, it's like, well, first of all, you're going to need the preview, the image capture app is going
[01:32:40.800 --> 01:32:44.960]   to show you where the pictures are. And then this other app is going to show you where the music is.
[01:32:44.960 --> 01:32:50.800]   And yeah, no, this is much better. And by the way, there is so there are all the tabs for the
[01:32:50.800 --> 01:32:57.440]   media types, music, movies, TV shows, podcast, audiobooks, books, photos, files, and info.
[01:32:57.440 --> 01:33:02.480]   So there's plenty of information in that window centralized in one spot.
[01:33:02.480 --> 01:33:07.920]   I don't really, Laurie, maybe you watch TV on your Mac a lot. I don't know if I care that much
[01:33:07.920 --> 01:33:12.560]   about a TV app on the Mac. I do actually, when I'm working, I have a little window up in the
[01:33:12.560 --> 01:33:19.600]   background. So having the TV up come to Mac is a big deal just because right now I go to Netflix
[01:33:19.600 --> 01:33:26.320]   and I put up a screen and I use the pip of fire to have a little window and window up in the corner.
[01:33:26.320 --> 01:33:31.280]   Or I go to iTunes and I pull a movie. So having it all in one place just means easy.
[01:33:31.280 --> 01:33:36.240]   It's easier for me to just kind of jump into a TV or movie and just have it there. Because,
[01:33:36.240 --> 01:33:42.880]   again, I don't fully watch it, but it's kind of my background noise. And so I love the idea of
[01:33:42.880 --> 01:33:46.480]   able to jump in and out of all of my TV shows and movies all in one place.
[01:33:47.360 --> 01:33:51.600]   Also, it just makes sense. If you don't have the TV app on the Mac,
[01:33:51.600 --> 01:33:56.080]   everybody's going to ask you, where do I download the TV app on the Mac? Because I can expect that.
[01:33:56.080 --> 01:33:58.960]   They're not going to imagine that it's not simply available.
[01:33:58.960 --> 01:34:05.040]   How could you not have a TV app? Let's see. There's so much to talk about. I'm just kind of
[01:34:05.040 --> 01:34:10.880]   picking and choosing it. Random little tidbits. We didn't talk too much about the ability to
[01:34:10.880 --> 01:34:16.320]   on an iPad Pro to use the USB-C port as a storage. We did mention that you have a camera connect.
[01:34:16.320 --> 01:34:19.920]   It's kind of very much streamlined photographers workflow. Go right into Lightroom now.
[01:34:19.920 --> 01:34:25.680]   Jeez. The ability to connect to SMB directly from the Files app.
[01:34:25.680 --> 01:34:31.680]   Isn't that amazing? They've isolated what has always been for me.
[01:34:31.680 --> 01:34:36.240]   The hugest pain point of using an iPad Pro is a primary device when I'm outside the office.
[01:34:36.240 --> 01:34:42.880]   The Files app originally was a very good first step to that. But the ability to, again,
[01:34:42.880 --> 01:34:49.680]   here is a arbitrary USB key that has files on it. I just want to get the electrons from here
[01:34:49.680 --> 01:34:55.200]   onto there. There's nothing more frustrating than knowing that. But the files are right here.
[01:34:55.200 --> 01:34:57.680]   If I could just plug this into that, you go.
[01:34:57.680 --> 01:35:04.880]   Will you be able to backup to an external USB device in some way?
[01:35:04.880 --> 01:35:10.320]   The backup system can't target it yet. That could be a possible for the future.
[01:35:10.320 --> 01:35:15.840]   But they've done a lot for security. Obviously, it doesn't run when those executables or even
[01:35:15.840 --> 01:35:20.400]   Mac executables. But just in general, you did a lot so that you don't have to worry about
[01:35:20.400 --> 01:35:24.960]   juice jacking or arbitrary malware on the stick when you plug in your files. They've tried to
[01:35:24.960 --> 01:35:32.480]   keep it as secure as iOS is secure. I got to tell you, with screen support built into Catalina,
[01:35:32.480 --> 01:35:40.640]   the idea of buying an iPad Pro specifically as an external display for a Mac Mini is super hot.
[01:35:40.640 --> 01:35:47.120]   I've been doing that with GWT for a long time. What do you got there, Laurie?
[01:35:47.120 --> 01:35:54.160]   This is Sidecar on iPad and Beauty. And I'm telling you, it's adorable. I know it's very
[01:35:54.160 --> 01:35:58.080]   pointless on an iPad. I just love running it. It's so cute.
[01:35:58.080 --> 01:36:04.560]   No, no, but just just like you said with Apple TV, just being able to have the Apple TV app and
[01:36:04.560 --> 01:36:11.120]   basically send it to the iPad screen, just the ability to have to have use of it as a graphics
[01:36:11.120 --> 01:36:16.240]   tablet with your Apple pencil on and on and on and on. That is the one that's single handedly.
[01:36:16.240 --> 01:36:20.880]   They have made the Mac a lot cooler and the iPad a lot cooler. And now again, lock in is not a
[01:36:20.880 --> 01:36:25.760]   problem. So long as you give the user so many benefits for having bought all of your hardware
[01:36:25.760 --> 01:36:30.240]   from the same company. It's blazing. There was a guy walking around McHenry with a
[01:36:30.240 --> 01:36:35.840]   trash can Mac Pearl using the iPad as a display. You would just pop it down in the labs,
[01:36:35.840 --> 01:36:39.840]   pull out his iPad and say, can you help me with this? That's funny.
[01:36:39.840 --> 01:36:43.200]   It's a couple of car batteries in the backpack to power it.
[01:36:43.200 --> 01:36:47.120]   It's funny. Well, you can buy that dongle. I can't remember the name I have one at home.
[01:36:47.120 --> 01:36:52.080]   Luna display. I bought it because of you, Laurie.
[01:36:53.600 --> 01:36:57.360]   The only advantage to it still has and it's sad because duet kind of got
[01:36:57.360 --> 01:36:59.920]   Sherlock by this, but it does work with windows as well.
[01:36:59.920 --> 01:37:03.600]   So there's a small number with multi touch as far as I recall, right?
[01:37:03.600 --> 01:37:11.600]   You can use duet display with a touch screen. And so yeah, I think it is it.
[01:37:11.600 --> 01:37:16.400]   It's one of those weird situations where on the one hand you do feel bad for developers when
[01:37:16.400 --> 01:37:22.400]   they've worked so hard on this amazing feature, this amazing app. And then Apple just comes in with
[01:37:22.400 --> 01:37:28.160]   like a something that's not even nearly as cool. And they get lots of like
[01:37:28.160 --> 01:37:31.360]   who ras for it. You know, a duet display has this amazing
[01:37:31.360 --> 01:37:35.680]   second screen app that does a lot more than sidecar does.
[01:37:35.680 --> 01:37:44.640]   What this, me, what this means is duet display is for people who have always been wanting to use
[01:37:44.640 --> 01:37:49.440]   a second screen with their iPhone or with their iPad and their Mac computer.
[01:37:49.440 --> 01:37:53.360]   And they've always needed it and they have it and they have amazing control
[01:37:53.360 --> 01:37:59.040]   and they have all these features and sidecars for people who never really needed it before.
[01:37:59.040 --> 01:38:04.160]   And now there's just this thing that they can do. So, you know, it's actually a benefit to
[01:38:04.160 --> 01:38:10.560]   companies like duet display for for being able to like, okay, so Apple has sidecar, but look what
[01:38:10.560 --> 01:38:16.560]   we can do. It's way better. So people who never used it before, they try sidecar and they go,
[01:38:16.560 --> 01:38:21.120]   well, this is really cool. And then they go, wait, do I display does this too? This is even better.
[01:38:21.120 --> 01:38:26.960]   I'm going to go use that now, even though I never thought of it before. So, hopefully that's a
[01:38:26.960 --> 01:38:34.080]   boon for the Sherlock developers, you know. I love the idea of being able to get an airplane
[01:38:34.080 --> 01:38:39.920]   with a laptop and a iPad Pro and have a dual screen set up on my trade table.
[01:38:41.280 --> 01:38:47.520]   It's a little greedy, but it's good. No, or just I've used that display. I've used that set up when
[01:38:47.520 --> 01:38:52.080]   I'm traveling where I've got like a book project and I just need a second display for reference or
[01:38:52.080 --> 01:38:58.480]   any second. I will not, I will not bring like a $6,000 monitor in a Pelican case, but I, it's,
[01:38:58.480 --> 01:39:03.040]   but I will, I will probably already be taking my iPad just to watch movies on the on the plane.
[01:39:03.040 --> 01:39:08.720]   So it just adds so much value just for the cost of at worst, like another USB cable, maybe.
[01:39:08.720 --> 01:39:14.800]   Yeah. Anything we're, oh, I'm sorry. It shouldn't have anything.
[01:39:14.800 --> 01:39:19.520]   We're shopping. No, actually, I'm installing duet display. I forgot. I could put this on my
[01:39:19.520 --> 01:39:23.520]   windows. You know, what you should do is you should have like a life-size sticker of like
[01:39:23.520 --> 01:39:28.000]   you're facing your shoulders up on the back. So we do have it held up. Oh, your emoji. Yeah.
[01:39:28.000 --> 01:39:33.120]   We're going to wrap it up because we're, you know, we've already gone a bit of a way and there's
[01:39:33.120 --> 01:39:37.840]   millions of things we haven't talked about, but I'll give each one of you a chance to say anything
[01:39:37.840 --> 01:39:43.760]   that we haven't talked about yet from WWDC or a highlight of WWDC. Let's start with Renee and
[01:39:43.760 --> 01:39:50.640]   Laurie, because they were there. Renee. No, I mean, we talked about all the biggest stuff as far as I
[01:39:50.640 --> 01:39:55.360]   was concerned. And there was just, there's a bunch of home pod stuff and AirPod stuff that's really
[01:39:55.360 --> 01:40:00.400]   cool. Like you can now connect multiple AirPods. You'll be able to do hand off. So if you're listening
[01:40:00.400 --> 01:40:04.000]   on your home pod, you can bring your iPhone next to it. It'll transfer whatever you're listening
[01:40:04.000 --> 01:40:07.520]   to to your iPhone. Sorry. And then you can just go with it. And when you come back, you can do the
[01:40:07.520 --> 01:40:12.800]   same thing. HomePod has multi-user Apple TV has multi-user. And I think we'll hear more about that
[01:40:12.800 --> 01:40:16.240]   as we get into the fall. I think just told some of those features they haven't even announced yet.
[01:40:16.240 --> 01:40:19.840]   Laurie, something you thought was good that we didn't mention?
[01:40:19.840 --> 01:40:26.080]   The cycles, it's actually not its own separate app, but the cycles and the watch,
[01:40:26.080 --> 01:40:31.120]   health tracking, that's actually on, it's not just talking to watch, it's also on your iPhone.
[01:40:31.120 --> 01:40:36.320]   So for women who don't have an Apple watch, they can track their cycles on their phone. So that,
[01:40:36.320 --> 01:40:40.160]   to me, is a really great thing for women's health. So I'm glad you mentioned it. Yeah,
[01:40:40.160 --> 01:40:47.120]   cycles. And I love the audio sound, met pressure meter on the Apple watch to let warn you if you're
[01:40:47.120 --> 01:40:53.600]   in a noisy, dangerous, noisy environment. Yeah, that's another, again, I was really excited to
[01:40:53.600 --> 01:41:00.080]   find, we kind of knew about cycles, but we didn't know about the noise feature. And I immediately
[01:41:00.080 --> 01:41:04.880]   thought, oh, I can't wait. I mean, I'm going to need that, except you're going to be on stage
[01:41:04.880 --> 01:41:09.600]   singing and it's going to go, it's going to be bright red constantly. Yeah, it's going to be so
[01:41:09.600 --> 01:41:14.080]   fun to just like see what it does, because I'm always in environments like that, like three
[01:41:14.080 --> 01:41:19.520]   times a week. Do you wear earplugs? Do you protect me here? I do. Always wear earplugs. Please. Thank you.
[01:41:19.520 --> 01:41:26.080]   I didn't. So here's the thing real quick on that. I didn't use to, and I do have tonight is I have
[01:41:26.080 --> 01:41:31.520]   the concert ringing in my ear. And if I could go back in time and tell my younger self,
[01:41:32.240 --> 01:41:37.920]   just wear earplugs, I would be so happy. And I didn't. And I tell everyone when I see them
[01:41:37.920 --> 01:41:43.120]   young people, any, they're not wearing earplugs, I give them my story of if I could do anything
[01:41:43.120 --> 01:41:47.280]   to go back in time and stop my ears from ringing all the time, I would have done that because
[01:41:47.280 --> 01:41:53.040]   it's a very irritating experience. And I think this noise app is a really great example or way
[01:41:53.040 --> 01:41:59.440]   to tell you, hey, maybe you should put your earplugs in or hey, you should remember to put
[01:41:59.440 --> 01:42:03.120]   your earplugs in. And for some people, they're never going to do it and they're going to end up
[01:42:03.120 --> 01:42:07.440]   like me and they're going to wish they did. But for a lot of people, they're not going to realize
[01:42:07.440 --> 01:42:12.960]   they're not going to remember. Oh, I'm in this environment that's really loud. And this will just
[01:42:12.960 --> 01:42:19.520]   go, you know, it's been five minutes and this decibel level is above 92. Do you want to put your
[01:42:19.520 --> 01:42:26.480]   earplugs in? So it's going to be really great for hearing health, I think. If even one, one fewer
[01:42:26.480 --> 01:42:33.200]   person has ten of this. Because of this, Apple's done their job here. I have constant ringing in my
[01:42:33.200 --> 01:42:37.920]   ears at all times as well. And it was probably for the same reason, because I was a singer in a
[01:42:37.920 --> 01:42:43.200]   punk band. No, probably for the same reason, because I, when I listened to music at a young age, I
[01:42:43.200 --> 01:42:48.320]   love to sit right next to the speakers and get as loud as I could. I love the feeling. And of course,
[01:42:48.320 --> 01:42:52.160]   I'd leave every concert with ringing ears, but I thought, well, that'll go away. And you know,
[01:42:52.160 --> 01:42:56.800]   some sometimes. And it did when we were younger. Yeah. Yeah. It did when we were younger. And then
[01:42:56.800 --> 01:43:03.200]   one day you wake up and you hear a ringing in your ear and you think, Oh, no, what happened? And then
[01:43:03.200 --> 01:43:10.960]   it never goes away after that. Andy, anything in particular you think we may be missed in covering
[01:43:10.960 --> 01:43:18.640]   WWDC? Probably voice control, because which kind of I came and went through my awareness while I
[01:43:18.640 --> 01:43:25.440]   was watching it. But the more that I've been reading about people like Stephen Aquino, who does such
[01:43:25.440 --> 01:43:31.920]   really wonderful work covering, covering accessibility on Apple products, it really does seem to be
[01:43:31.920 --> 01:43:40.160]   almost a reinvention of being able to control the Mac, being able to control your iOS devices with
[01:43:40.160 --> 01:43:45.360]   just your voice for people who have problems operating the devices with their hands. And all
[01:43:45.360 --> 01:43:50.480]   the subtle things that are happening under the hood to make it happen, of just trying to figure
[01:43:50.480 --> 01:43:56.240]   out when is the user actually paying attention to the device and trying to control this with
[01:43:56.240 --> 01:44:01.920]   alternative method, as opposed to here's a here is a here is a wake word we have to use to enable
[01:44:01.920 --> 01:44:07.360]   this sort of a feature to prevent it from turning on and turning off unnecessarily. I'm still trying
[01:44:07.360 --> 01:44:16.800]   to get behind it. Again, I rely on people like Stephen Aquino to really show me exactly how these
[01:44:16.800 --> 01:44:21.760]   things work. I subscribe to the the excess is a accessible podcast. I keep forgetting he does
[01:44:21.760 --> 01:44:27.520]   it with Timothy Buck as well. And this is he has they have a great episode, I think just from
[01:44:27.520 --> 01:44:35.680]   last week. Yeah, just last week, they actually interviewed Sarah Harlinger from Apple about the
[01:44:35.680 --> 01:44:43.360]   whole feature. So it's it's more impressive than I first caught on, but I'm not qualified to speak
[01:44:43.360 --> 01:44:50.000]   about it. Yeah, yeah, very exciting. And that's I think it's interesting that Apple has this coherent
[01:44:50.000 --> 01:44:57.520]   plan to make excessive make that iPad accessible or iOS accessible from keyboard, I guess not your
[01:44:57.520 --> 01:45:03.120]   phone, but from keyboard from touch and from voice. It's all of it.
[01:45:03.120 --> 01:45:09.280]   And also, and also, yeah, that's really cool. It's like Blade Runner Leo zoom enhanced. Yeah,
[01:45:09.280 --> 01:45:14.000]   it's zoom. Yeah, we talked we talked about how wonderful is going to be to be able to use an
[01:45:14.000 --> 01:45:19.280]   iPad with a mouse, but the ability to use an assistive pointing device that can do the touches for
[01:45:19.280 --> 01:45:24.880]   you is not it's an it's it's an it's the features inside accessibility for a reason. And I'm glad
[01:45:24.880 --> 01:45:29.280]   that it is opening up the device to people who would have found that device a lot more difficult
[01:45:29.280 --> 01:45:34.080]   to use otherwise. Yeah, very important. All right. Also, I'm not a gaming nerd. So maybe you guys
[01:45:34.080 --> 01:45:38.880]   anticipated this, but the difference in cheers for PlayStation four over Xbox controllers.
[01:45:38.880 --> 01:45:45.360]   That's just a installed base issue. Honestly, it's just it's all about the installed base.
[01:45:45.360 --> 01:45:51.200]   No trouble. It just happened to be a lot of PlayStation fans at that particular keynote or
[01:45:51.200 --> 01:45:56.000]   something. PlayStation outsells Xbox. And those work on iOS as well as Apple TV,
[01:45:56.000 --> 01:45:59.520]   which is cool. Yeah, no, I think that's really cool. Yeah, I'm very excited about that.
[01:45:59.520 --> 01:46:04.400]   Let's take a break. Your picks coming up. Lori's gonna tell me what to buy next.
[01:46:04.400 --> 01:46:10.960]   But first, a word from WordPress. I'll tell you, I'm going to tell you that if you do not have a
[01:46:10.960 --> 01:46:16.480]   website as an individual or a business, you're kind of missing out on this whole internet thing.
[01:46:16.480 --> 01:46:20.800]   You might have heard of it. Yeah, you say no, I have Facebook. I have Twitter. No, no, no. I mean
[01:46:20.800 --> 01:46:26.080]   a website, a place where people Google your name or business. They go there. They find it. They
[01:46:26.080 --> 01:46:31.360]   see your best stuff. They see your menus. They see your hours. They make reservations. They buy
[01:46:31.360 --> 01:46:39.120]   stuff. They if you're a young person, they see your, you know, your video of your track milestone,
[01:46:39.120 --> 01:46:45.360]   you know, or stuff that shows off your best side. You've got to have a website. Everybody does.
[01:46:45.360 --> 01:46:50.720]   And there's no better place to make that website than WordPress.com. WordPress was created.
[01:46:50.720 --> 01:46:58.960]   How many years ago now? 15, 20, almost 20 years ago was created to let anyone pursue whatever
[01:46:58.960 --> 01:47:05.200]   they it is they love by launching a site that's free to start with room to grow. WordPress.com
[01:47:05.200 --> 01:47:15.120]   makes it absolutely easy. No two week trials, no hidden fees. WordPress owners, users own their
[01:47:15.120 --> 01:47:21.440]   own content forever. You can create a site free to start, but there's lots of room to grow. I
[01:47:21.440 --> 01:47:27.120]   actually started free too 12 years ago when I started at WordPress.com. Now I'm a business
[01:47:27.120 --> 01:47:32.080]   subscriber because I want all the all the great features including e-commerce offered for businesses,
[01:47:32.080 --> 01:47:38.560]   powerful site building tools, unlimited number of themes, plugins, 24/7 support. Actually,
[01:47:38.560 --> 01:47:45.600]   everybody gets that 24/7 support from real WordPress experts. 300 of them ready to help you
[01:47:45.600 --> 01:47:51.920]   with your site. So you're never alone. WordPress is really great. And if you know a teenager,
[01:47:51.920 --> 01:47:56.320]   somebody's starting to life out and they don't have a website, this would be a great gift.
[01:47:56.320 --> 01:48:02.000]   Maybe for dad for father's day, dad, I set up a WordPress site for you. WordPress.com.
[01:48:02.000 --> 01:48:08.160]   It's so flexible, so powerful. Some of the biggest companies on the earth use it to build their
[01:48:08.160 --> 01:48:13.360]   websites. Fortune.com, which is what Ferri was here with Fast Company, they use it.
[01:48:13.360 --> 01:48:18.320]   Quartz uses it. Millions of people use WordPress.com every day to turn their dreams into reality.
[01:48:18.320 --> 01:48:25.360]   I got my 12 year logo. I've been there 12 years. It gets started now. 12 years from now,
[01:48:25.360 --> 01:48:30.640]   you could say I've been there 12 years. WordPress.com/Macbreak. Actually, when you use that address,
[01:48:30.640 --> 01:48:34.880]   you let them know you saw it here, which is great, but you also get 15% off any new plan purchase.
[01:48:36.480 --> 01:48:43.840]   We love your WordPress. WordPress.com/Macbreak. 15% off your new WordPress site. My site is
[01:48:43.840 --> 01:48:51.040]   leoloport.com. I just love it. It's so easy to use WordPress.com/Macbreak.
[01:48:51.040 --> 01:48:55.600]   Okay, Laurie, I got my checkbook out. Laurie McGill. McGill, why do I call you McGill?
[01:48:55.600 --> 01:48:58.880]   Laurie Gill. I don't know, but I like it. Laurie McGill.
[01:48:58.880 --> 01:49:02.400]   Let's call you McGill for a minute. Actually, Gill's short for your real last name, isn't it?
[01:49:03.280 --> 01:49:06.400]   Is that secret? My real last name is Gill Patrick. Oh, you don't have to say that loud.
[01:49:06.400 --> 01:49:12.240]   No, I just, I think, I know. I think Gill is just a fun little short way to remember my name,
[01:49:12.240 --> 01:49:18.960]   and it sounds really cool. And my dad's nickname in high school was Gill. And my brother makes me
[01:49:18.960 --> 01:49:25.440]   little Gill when I was a person. I've just, I've been calling myself Gill for a very long time.
[01:49:25.440 --> 01:49:31.760]   No, I love it. And the only reason I know that is in our correspondence with Elisa,
[01:49:32.800 --> 01:49:36.800]   because we're setting you up with, you know, that PayPal account because you live in Canada.
[01:49:36.800 --> 01:49:44.720]   Lisa said, no, I know. Lisa said, wait a minute. Laurie doesn't live in Canada. I said, no,
[01:49:44.720 --> 01:49:52.480]   I know. She's just up the road. I was looking forward to meeting her in person, and she's like,
[01:49:52.480 --> 01:49:55.680]   yeah, someday, you know, when we go to visit Canada, you visit us.
[01:49:59.120 --> 01:50:05.520]   No, I don't know how that happened. But anyway, what is your pick, Ms. Gill Patrick?
[01:50:05.520 --> 01:50:12.000]   Well, when I, when I fly to come visit you, yes, fly all the, you could fly. It's not a long
[01:50:12.000 --> 01:50:17.280]   flight. Oh, God, no, it would take longer just to get to the airport to go. That's right.
[01:50:17.280 --> 01:50:22.960]   That's right. But when I go flying, I will be using flight tunes. And Leo, you probably won't
[01:50:22.960 --> 01:50:27.920]   want to see something like this, too. What? It's wireless Bluetooth transmitter, which
[01:50:27.920 --> 01:50:32.560]   does exist in the world. That's not that big of a deal. This one's made by Scotio. And they're
[01:50:32.560 --> 01:50:38.080]   they're pretty darn good company. This particular version allows you to pair two
[01:50:38.080 --> 01:50:45.280]   Bluetooth speakers to any device that is through. It only has a 3.5 millimeter check. So
[01:50:45.280 --> 01:50:50.400]   in this case, they're specifically talking about airplanes because they don't, you can't get
[01:50:50.400 --> 01:50:55.360]   Bluetooth on an airplane when you're trying to watch the movies. You can use it with like
[01:50:55.360 --> 01:50:59.920]   exercise devices or even your receiver at home that, you know, if it's really old,
[01:50:59.920 --> 01:51:05.360]   then it doesn't have a Bluetooth connection like mine. You can plug this into the 3.5 millimeter
[01:51:05.360 --> 01:51:10.320]   jack and it becomes a Bluetooth transmitter for your headphones. This one likes to do it with
[01:51:10.320 --> 01:51:16.080]   two sets of headphones. So you and your wife or you and your kids or whatever can be sitting next
[01:51:16.080 --> 01:51:21.120]   to each other on the plane watching the same movie using two, two separate sets of Bluetooth
[01:51:21.120 --> 01:51:26.160]   headphones and you're kind of free to roam. The really special thing about this one, I think
[01:51:26.160 --> 01:51:35.760]   it actually has two folding prongs. So it will work with the different variety of airplanes that
[01:51:35.760 --> 01:51:44.560]   have to plug in. And it also comes with an additional cord adapter. So if you're using something that,
[01:51:44.560 --> 01:51:50.720]   you know, the 3.5 millimeter jack and it's a very small little space, it'll still fit because you
[01:51:50.720 --> 01:51:56.720]   use this little cord adapter that will kind of give you the the extender dongle. And they've
[01:51:56.720 --> 01:52:02.160]   confirmed that it does work with Nintendo Switch, which I'm very excited about because there's not
[01:52:02.160 --> 01:52:07.120]   a lot of Bluetooth transmitters that actually work with Nintendo Switch. So that's a really big
[01:52:07.120 --> 01:52:13.360]   deal to go ahead. And this means things like using your AirPods or in my case, your PowerBeats Pro
[01:52:14.000 --> 01:52:21.360]   with your Nintendo Switch, which is kind of awesome to listen to the music, the breath of the wild
[01:52:21.360 --> 01:52:31.520]   music or the animal crossing music while you're playing games. Don't laugh. Oh, he's laughing at
[01:52:31.520 --> 01:52:36.560]   that. He's laughing at this video. He's watching the guy like, "I'm so happy to be using that
[01:52:36.560 --> 01:52:46.000]   but this is the one way." We're watching the advertising video for 14s. But actually, I'm going
[01:52:46.000 --> 01:52:49.840]   to, you know what, Laurie, I am going to buy this. This will go very nicely with my Infinity Scarf
[01:52:49.840 --> 01:52:58.000]   pillow for my next flight. I am ready. Put it in your airplane bag. Yeah, that is fantastic.
[01:52:58.000 --> 01:53:04.960]   Wow. How much are they? I think they're 30, 40. They shouldn't be too expensive because these devices
[01:53:04.960 --> 01:53:10.720]   in general aren't hideously expensive. Yeah, it's 30. That's true. Keep in mind that you also
[01:53:10.720 --> 01:53:15.680]   you get what you pay for and the good quality comes in the technology behind it, which
[01:53:15.680 --> 01:53:21.040]   anything that supports Nintendo Switch is it has a little bit of extra juice to it to make it
[01:53:21.040 --> 01:53:26.880]   work really well because that's not an easy thing to do. There's also lag issues. And so
[01:53:27.600 --> 01:53:33.920]   I haven't gone into the details on what they use for a lag of wins, but I believe it's
[01:53:33.920 --> 01:53:39.280]   so it's, I think it says on here somewhere, I'm sorry, I wasn't prepared for checking that.
[01:53:39.280 --> 01:53:47.280]   It's that's also a good thing. So at $40, you're getting about the right price for it.
[01:53:47.280 --> 01:53:52.480]   Yeah. It's for something that has that kind of stuff. It's Bluetooth 4.1, probably not 5,
[01:53:52.480 --> 01:53:56.480]   but I don't know. And by the way, that's an important point is that you are allowed to use
[01:53:56.480 --> 01:54:01.840]   Bluetooth on an airplane. I think some you know, you put on airplane mode, it turns every radio
[01:54:01.840 --> 01:54:06.800]   off, but you can turn the Bluetooth back on. If they affect the other day, I was on a plane and
[01:54:06.800 --> 01:54:12.640]   they said you can use Bluetooth. Like I guess people don't know that. So some of the flights,
[01:54:12.640 --> 01:54:16.720]   they still say no, but it seems arbitrary to me at this point. Yeah, probably Air Canada.
[01:54:16.720 --> 01:54:21.520]   Air Canada sometimes says yes, sometimes says no, it's that funny. They say take off your
[01:54:21.520 --> 01:54:25.200]   headphones while we're taking off and landing. We want you to pay attention if we crash.
[01:54:25.200 --> 01:54:29.040]   Yeah. Because you don't need to say sorry to,
[01:54:29.040 --> 01:54:31.760]   or exiting the plane, Leo. It's like it's big business. Yeah.
[01:54:31.760 --> 01:54:38.080]   Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Renee, sorry. Sorry about that. Sorry. Sorry.
[01:54:38.080 --> 01:54:42.880]   Renee, by the way, you're rooting for the Raptors probably, right?
[01:54:42.880 --> 01:54:49.360]   Their basketball team? Yeah. Okay. Good. Okay. You may now give us your pick of the week.
[01:54:50.240 --> 01:54:57.520]   Go Canada. So long time watchers of this show know this, but I used to be a flash developer
[01:54:57.520 --> 01:55:03.040]   for a very brief period of time. And since we've murdered flash just to watch it die,
[01:55:03.040 --> 01:55:07.120]   there's been sort of what tool do you use? And for a long time now, I've been using
[01:55:07.120 --> 01:55:12.240]   hype instead. It's by Tomalt. It's former Apple engineers. They do a really, really good job,
[01:55:12.240 --> 01:55:16.560]   really, really smart team. And they've just come out with hype for. And I was going to do this
[01:55:16.560 --> 01:55:20.240]   whole thing like, yeah, you can believe the hype and like a whole public enemy riff, but
[01:55:20.240 --> 01:55:26.400]   I'm going to save all of us that embarrassment. And just talk about, this is what I always wanted
[01:55:26.400 --> 01:55:32.160]   in a design tool for the web to make animations, to make rich experiences, to make movement,
[01:55:32.160 --> 01:55:37.680]   to make all of that cool stuff, because it does it using native web technologies. And it does it
[01:55:37.680 --> 01:55:43.200]   so beautifully, so lightly, so that the performance is great. I mean, there's, we have so many technologies
[01:55:43.200 --> 01:55:50.640]   now from Canvas to CSS transforms to all these really cool way of building fully interactive
[01:55:50.640 --> 01:55:55.120]   sites, like the kind you used to see for restaurants and movies without sort of the
[01:55:55.120 --> 01:56:00.720]   overheads and the plug-in architectures and the malware vectors that all of those introduced.
[01:56:00.720 --> 01:56:07.280]   And they just keep adding really, really cool features. The latest version has better polygons,
[01:56:07.280 --> 01:56:13.520]   better pass, better pencil tool, better shape morphing, line animations, physics. If I was
[01:56:13.520 --> 01:56:18.160]   still doing this kind of stuff, I would be so far all over this, but I'm super happy that they're
[01:56:18.160 --> 01:56:23.600]   still making it because we need a tool like this and they really think through and sweat all the
[01:56:23.600 --> 01:56:28.560]   little details. So if you're into this, if you want to make these really cool, you can use a
[01:56:28.560 --> 01:56:31.520]   Friday thing, you don't have to use it for the web, it's just, it's really at home there.
[01:56:31.520 --> 01:56:36.800]   Just check out hype for brand new, I think it came out yesterday. So it's fresh off the assembly
[01:56:36.800 --> 01:56:40.400]   line and it's got just all those really thoughtful things that Tumult is so great at.
[01:56:40.400 --> 01:56:46.080]   But then when you make this thing, is it for websites? What do you, what do you,
[01:56:46.080 --> 01:56:52.000]   yeah, it's usually for the more dynamic like entertainment driven. So standard web browsers
[01:56:52.000 --> 01:56:55.920]   would be able to play it back? Yeah, it's basically flash for eight,
[01:56:55.920 --> 01:57:01.680]   final five. Okay. Yeah. Oh, but it's, oh, I get it, the output's HTML five. Oh, nice.
[01:57:02.240 --> 01:57:07.200]   Oh, that's really cool. It's web native technologies, everything, almost, I think pretty much everything
[01:57:07.200 --> 01:57:10.640]   you could do with flash. Maybe some of the scripting would have to be JavaScript instead of
[01:57:10.640 --> 01:57:15.440]   flash script, but it's just all native. It's tremendous. Oh, that's really nice. So you still
[01:57:15.440 --> 01:57:19.840]   get all the capabilities of flash and you don't have to write hand code. HTML five, it'll do that
[01:57:19.840 --> 01:57:25.760]   for you. That's neat. That's really nice. Oh, Andy, what's the matter? What's the matter?
[01:57:25.760 --> 01:57:29.920]   I might be losing the room soon. Okay, quickly. Give us your pick. That's okay.
[01:57:30.960 --> 01:57:36.480]   No, there's someone at the door. There is a, when Apple, it looks like a false alarm,
[01:57:36.480 --> 01:57:39.360]   I think it was just like a little girl looking at teddy bear. Oh, good. I was just curious.
[01:57:39.360 --> 01:57:43.600]   That's what was going on. The teddy bears are here for their annual 12 o'clock. Okay.
[01:57:43.600 --> 01:57:50.320]   So, so when Apple made its announcement about iTunes is dead, dead, dead, dead, we finally did.
[01:57:50.320 --> 01:57:54.640]   I started looking into other music players just because I realized I haven't really looked at
[01:57:54.640 --> 01:57:59.600]   other music players. Yeah. And I know that all of the features of all the functionality of being
[01:57:59.600 --> 01:58:04.400]   able to play music locally on your on your Mac book on your Mac is still going to be there within the
[01:58:04.400 --> 01:58:11.760]   music app. But I did find an app called the Pine player that I really like because it's the one
[01:58:11.760 --> 01:58:19.120]   fault of iTunes I could never get around is that it really wants to always add stuff to your library.
[01:58:19.120 --> 01:58:25.840]   Whereas if I travel around with a 256 gig flash drive that has my entire music library on it,
[01:58:25.840 --> 01:58:31.440]   because I can't afford to keep that much storage tied up on my Mac book. But sometimes I just want
[01:58:31.440 --> 01:58:35.280]   to, oh, here's like a really obscure album. I kind of feel like playing right now. Do I really
[01:58:35.280 --> 01:58:39.920]   have to add it to my iTunes library just so I can listen to it for the next couple of hours.
[01:58:39.920 --> 01:58:45.600]   Pine player is based on files. So you just drag things into it and it plays whole albums,
[01:58:45.600 --> 01:58:52.080]   playlists you've created. The interface is really, really cool. It supports a multitude of very,
[01:58:52.080 --> 01:58:58.240]   very, very high quality formats, even ones that are kind of obscure can play SACDs directly.
[01:58:58.240 --> 01:59:04.160]   And I like and it keeps getting updated. The last update was just, or at least in the developer
[01:59:04.160 --> 01:59:09.600]   channel was just about a week or so ago. And there's something, I don't know, I don't know how to
[01:59:09.600 --> 01:59:17.520]   describe the user interface. There's just something about how it has no like, has no 3D colors and
[01:59:17.520 --> 01:59:22.880]   panels whooshing in and out. It's just, it looks like what a sound mixer, like a sound designer
[01:59:22.880 --> 01:59:28.160]   in a studio would want to have as their personal music player. It's not complicated, but it's not
[01:59:28.160 --> 01:59:33.680]   afraid to put a button someplace if you need to have a button someplace. And it's free. So for all
[01:59:33.680 --> 01:59:38.800]   that, it's just a free thing to have on your laptop. So I downloaded it last week and I've
[01:59:38.800 --> 01:59:44.160]   been using it actually a lot more than I thought I'd be using it. Even though I've got the, as I've
[01:59:44.160 --> 01:59:49.200]   said before, I've got Plex as my main music system for the entire house and for most of my mobile
[01:59:49.200 --> 01:59:54.320]   devices. But I keep finding lots of ways that I want to use it. Like I just downloaded something
[01:59:54.320 --> 01:59:58.400]   off the sound cloud. I want to listen to it or I've just loaded got some podcasts or something
[01:59:58.400 --> 02:00:02.720]   from my flash drive. So nice stuff. So that's my pick for the week.
[02:00:02.720 --> 02:00:05.440]   That's really sweet. Does it whip the llamas, but though?
[02:00:05.440 --> 02:00:11.680]   I don't, you know, llamas, I don't think they need their butt-swipped. I think that you talk to
[02:00:11.680 --> 02:00:16.400]   them. You try to understand why they're upset and you solve the problems from a point of respect.
[02:00:16.400 --> 02:00:21.600]   Because they'll spit it if you whip their well, even even spitt. It's it's you want to find you
[02:00:21.600 --> 02:00:30.080]   want to do one of these, you know, one of the. That's I'm downloading that I use Vox on iOS and
[02:00:30.080 --> 02:00:35.440]   Mac, but that's you pay for it. You pay for it and there's a whole lot of, oh, set up your
[02:00:35.440 --> 02:00:40.400]   Vox account. Oh, yeah, set up a Vox account. But I can't. This is hi. I've made a music player drag
[02:00:40.400 --> 02:00:44.240]   a father drag a folder, drag an album into it. I will play the album for you. I love it.
[02:00:44.240 --> 02:00:45.680]   That's awesome. I like that. Yes.
[02:00:45.680 --> 02:00:52.320]   My pick comes from yes, from earlier today when we had iOS today, we interviewed Rosemary Orchard,
[02:00:52.320 --> 02:00:56.960]   who's really fantastic. She does a podcast. I'm so good. Yeah, you know her. Yeah, I was so
[02:00:56.960 --> 02:01:02.720]   impressed. And we were talking about shortcuts and automation. But one of the things that she talked
[02:01:02.720 --> 02:01:12.000]   a lot about, which was news to me is using JavaScript to automate iOS. If shortcuts won't do what you
[02:01:12.000 --> 02:01:18.800]   need to do, turns out JavaScript has low level access to a lot of routines on iOS and it is very
[02:01:18.800 --> 02:01:25.600]   powerful. And the tool you'll want, which is available for the app store is called Scriptable.
[02:01:25.600 --> 02:01:32.080]   It allows you to automate iOS using JavaScript. Now it's simple JavaScript. You don't have to be a
[02:01:32.080 --> 02:01:37.440]   Java script guru. And of course, it comes with a lot of sample scripts to give you a sense of
[02:01:37.440 --> 02:01:43.040]   what you can do. But I was really impressed. So if you use shortcuts, but you're maybe
[02:01:43.040 --> 02:01:48.720]   ready to take the next level, I will be delving into this. I haven't played with it yet. But
[02:01:48.720 --> 02:01:53.760]   after talking to Rosemary, I was kind of an eye opener. And of course, shortcuts is getting smarter
[02:01:53.760 --> 02:01:58.560]   and smarter. But if you do, for instance, if you use drafts, which I'm a huge fan of,
[02:01:59.360 --> 02:02:03.600]   you can use Scriptable to create new drafts actions because those are in JavaScript,
[02:02:03.600 --> 02:02:09.280]   things like that. And it gives you access to a huge number of native frameworks.
[02:02:09.280 --> 02:02:14.160]   So I think it's pretty impressive. This is an example. This is in the app, some of the
[02:02:14.160 --> 02:02:21.280]   examples. I know you'll like this one. Loads the latest XKCD comic and shows it in a pop-up and
[02:02:21.280 --> 02:02:28.240]   then has Siri read it. So I think that this is using the Quick Look API. So and look how short
[02:02:28.240 --> 02:02:32.320]   that script is. I mean, anybody, you don't have to be a JavaScript guru to write that. Don't worry,
[02:02:32.320 --> 02:02:37.040]   there's no, you don't have to manage the DOM or anything like that. This is really cool.
[02:02:37.040 --> 02:02:43.600]   Scriptable, it's a free download. I don't know if there's in-app purchases or not, but
[02:02:43.600 --> 02:02:48.240]   I'm looking forward to playing with this a little bit. I'm very impressed. It's kind of like Pythonista,
[02:02:48.240 --> 02:02:52.960]   which is a Python for macOS, but even more capable.
[02:02:54.800 --> 02:03:00.560]   Thank you, everybody, for joining us. Really appreciate it. We do Mac Break Weekly every
[02:03:00.560 --> 02:03:07.760]   Tuesday, right after iOS today. It's usually around 11am Pacific, 2pm Eastern, 1700 UTC.
[02:03:07.760 --> 02:03:12.960]   The live stream, audio and video available at Twit.tv/live, or you can ask your Amazon
[02:03:12.960 --> 02:03:19.120]   Echo, you could say Echo, listen to Twit Live. And it'll just play it automatically,
[02:03:19.120 --> 02:03:23.760]   which is pretty sweet. You can also ask for the latest version of Mac Break Weekly or any of
[02:03:23.760 --> 02:03:28.480]   our podcasts the same way from any of your smart devices. I don't know, a Siri do podcasts yet.
[02:03:28.480 --> 02:03:33.520]   Can I just say, listen? You could say, hey, Shlomo, listen to Mac Break Weekly podcast.
[02:03:33.520 --> 02:03:39.680]   Good. Do it every week. Nice. You can do that too. Automatically.
[02:03:39.680 --> 02:03:41.760]   And iOS 13 automatically.
[02:03:41.760 --> 02:03:46.320]   Well, I mean, it's not the only way to listen. We also have copies of the show, audio and video
[02:03:46.320 --> 02:03:53.280]   available at Twit.tv/mbw. And of course, if you have a podcast app you like, including the Apple
[02:03:53.280 --> 02:03:56.880]   podcast app, you can always subscribe. In fact, would you do that for us? That way, you'll get
[02:03:56.880 --> 02:04:02.720]   every episode automatically. The instant it's available. Thanks for joining us everybody.
[02:04:02.720 --> 02:04:08.560]   Thank you, Renee at imore.com. Always a pleasure to the Vector podcast, imore.com/vector.
[02:04:08.560 --> 02:04:11.040]   Lori. I had Bud Triple on this week.
[02:04:11.040 --> 02:04:16.960]   Oh, let's talk about privacy. Yeah, I was shocked. I was not expecting it. It was a surprise.
[02:04:16.960 --> 02:04:20.080]   And then he came out and I was told I had 30 minutes to chat with him about privacy.
[02:04:20.080 --> 02:04:24.160]   And I just took advantage of it. Big shot. That's fantastic. That's really exciting.
[02:04:24.160 --> 02:04:28.320]   Okay. That's imore.com/vector. I must listen or watch.
[02:04:28.320 --> 02:04:34.720]   Lori Gill. She's also an imore where she is the managing editor. And sick,
[02:04:34.720 --> 02:04:40.720]   cure, sick burn playing anytime soon. We actually are on a little bit of a hiatus.
[02:04:40.720 --> 02:04:46.960]   Our next show is not until the 21st of June. So yeah, we've been off for a couple of weeks,
[02:04:46.960 --> 02:04:50.240]   but we're writing new songs and we're recording an album next week.
[02:04:50.240 --> 02:04:54.960]   That's exciting. That's a good reason to be taking some time off for the
[02:04:54.960 --> 02:04:57.520]   studio and the recording studio. Even the Rolling Stones do that.
[02:04:57.520 --> 02:05:03.680]   Gotta take some time off. Only we don't take a month to write it to record an album we take two days.
[02:05:03.680 --> 02:05:09.120]   Hey, that evens a lot. I think the first Beatles album was less than two hours.
[02:05:09.120 --> 02:05:15.440]   Thank you, Lori. And of course, Andy Inako, WGBH Boston. When are you appearing on
[02:05:15.440 --> 02:05:22.080]   a radio this week? Tomorrow on Wednesday, I think I'm from 1 to 1.30. And that's also going to be
[02:05:22.080 --> 02:05:26.480]   at the Boston Public Library studio. So if you go to Boston and you want to get a cup of coffee
[02:05:26.480 --> 02:05:30.720]   in a cookie and watch me adjust your with my hands even though I know we're on radio,
[02:05:30.720 --> 02:05:35.680]   go on down. Fantastic. As always, it's a real pleasure. All three of you.
[02:05:35.680 --> 02:05:40.720]   Thank you all for watching the show. We had a nice studio audience to do.
[02:05:40.720 --> 02:05:44.160]   To today, if you want to be here, tickets at Twitter.tv, just email us.
[02:05:44.160 --> 02:05:48.560]   We'll put a chair out for you. But now I'm sad to say it's time to go back to work.
[02:05:48.560 --> 02:05:51.280]   Because guess what? Break time. It's over.
[02:05:51.280 --> 02:05:59.440]   Heaven. Heaven for Fend.
[02:05:59.440 --> 02:06:05.040]   [Music]
